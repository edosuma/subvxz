00:00.148 --> 00:01.554
<i>Previously on</i> Cloak and Dagger...

00:01.579 --> 00:03.304
Who the hell are you?

00:07.125 --> 00:08.392
Billy!

00:08.417 --> 00:10.352
- What the hell did you do?
- I don't know!

00:10.377 --> 00:12.206
- You shot a kid.
- I need to call my uncle.

00:12.231 --> 00:13.617
What's he gonna do?

00:13.642 --> 00:14.931
He's gonna fix it.

00:14.956 --> 00:16.826
I'm sorry.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.280
- What's wrong?
- My wallet.

00:18.305 --> 00:19.514
Hey, blonde girl!

00:19.539 --> 00:21.030
Find rich kids,

00:21.055 --> 00:23.100
slip a little something
into their drinks,

00:23.125 --> 00:24.994
and jack them of their rich kid stuff.

00:25.030 --> 00:27.662
Let's ransack this bitch.

00:27.679 --> 00:28.764
I'm Andre Deschaine.

00:28.789 --> 00:30.558
I spent a lot of time
in this part of town.

00:30.559 --> 00:32.518
Sometimes people don't
know how to ask for help.

00:32.519 --> 00:33.558
Lia.

00:33.559 --> 00:34.795
Seeing one of my girls shot up

00:34.820 --> 00:36.468
so full of heroin has me on edge.

00:36.469 --> 00:37.888
I'm so sorry.

00:37.889 --> 00:39.429
Your mom said you had a big heart.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.888
Let me see your weapon, O'Reilly.

00:42.889 --> 00:44.888
You think the piece is off?
That could explain my score.

00:44.889 --> 00:47.138
Nah, it's perfectly fine.
Maybe it's in your head.

00:47.139 --> 00:49.314
In the dociles there
is almost no activity

00:49.339 --> 00:51.533
in the anger and rage centers
of the cerebral cortex.

00:51.580 --> 00:53.807
I can't even shoot straight
anymore. I'm useless.

00:53.832 --> 00:55.848
Watch out!

00:55.849 --> 00:57.016
What was that?

00:57.040 --> 00:58.808
It felt like she was being
sucked through me.

00:58.847 --> 01:01.136
- And why do you think that?
- 'Cause it happened once before...

01:01.137 --> 01:03.556
If it were me, I would
bring him back and end him.

01:03.557 --> 01:04.715
What if I can't protect them?

01:04.717 --> 01:06.346
What if they die, just like Billy?

01:06.347 --> 01:08.628
What if I pull him out and I'm
not brave enough to stop him.

01:13.927 --> 01:15.387
Tandy, what happened?

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074

01:26.007 --> 01:29.426
I suppose the best place
to start is with a story.

01:29.427 --> 01:30.806
After all,

01:30.807 --> 01:32.807
who doesn't love a good story?

01:35.967 --> 01:38.386
<i>It had been a long, harsh winter</i>

01:38.387 --> 01:40.676
<i>and the cold that had come months before</i>

01:40.677 --> 01:42.467
<i>dug its teeth into the land.</i>

01:43.807 --> 01:46.271
<i>It refused to give way to the thaw,</i>

01:46.958 --> 01:48.606
<i>to growth,</i>

01:48.807 --> 01:50.887
<i>to the goddess of spring.</i>

01:53.717 --> 01:56.266
<i>A late winter storm had come,</i>

01:56.267 --> 01:58.466
<i>turned the sky gray for days,</i>

01:58.467 --> 02:00.267
<i>like the stones of a river.</i>

02:04.347 --> 02:06.306
<i>It had lasted so long,</i>

02:06.307 --> 02:08.597
<i>the Farmer's hearth
had dwindled to ember.</i>

02:09.806 --> 02:12.846
<i>If he wanted to survive
until the spring,</i>

02:12.847 --> 02:14.887
<i>he needed more firewood.</i>

02:16.387 --> 02:18.386
<i>He had to go outside,</i>

02:18.387 --> 02:20.467
<i>had to brave the cold.</i>

02:21.767 --> 02:24.097
<i>Putting on his only pair of boots,</i>

02:25.427 --> 02:28.097
<i>he trudged through the
snow across a fallow field.</i>

02:30.267 --> 02:34.466
<i>He didn't see the roots he had
tripped on till he had fallen,</i>

02:34.467 --> 02:36.427
<i>until he was on his knees.</i>

02:38.887 --> 02:43.136
<i>And that is how the
Farmer came face-to-face</i>

02:43.137 --> 02:45.057
<i>with a Viper.</i>

02:58.267 --> 03:00.807
- How did this happen?
- Way too quickly.

03:01.847 --> 03:03.556
I went in for...

03:03.557 --> 03:06.006
the Other Brigid, but Connors was there.

03:06.007 --> 03:08.136
When she tried to kill him,
my protective-ish went up,

03:08.137 --> 03:10.716
and I was blown back out. I
grabbed for her, Ty, I swear...

03:10.717 --> 03:13.676
But instead you freed the
man who killed my brother.

03:13.677 --> 03:15.716
He could anywhere now.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.346
He could be after Brigid, my parents.

03:17.347 --> 03:19.556
Okay, so... so we find him.

03:19.557 --> 03:21.427
Look, how could you let this happen?

03:22.767 --> 03:24.766
I got screwed too, Ty.

03:24.767 --> 03:26.913
Okay? I went in there to
get leads on the assholes

03:26.938 --> 03:28.307
responsible for what
happened to those girls

03:28.332 --> 03:29.716
and I came out with zero.

03:35.767 --> 03:37.846
What is it?

03:37.847 --> 03:39.806
Nothing. It's...

03:39.807 --> 03:42.216
It's my mom. She's in full meltdown.

03:42.217 --> 03:44.650
Apparently there's no cell
reception in your hoodie.

03:45.717 --> 03:47.846
Go check on her.

03:47.847 --> 03:48.966
No, I...

03:48.967 --> 03:51.056
- I need to help you with Connors.
- Go.

03:51.057 --> 03:52.807
I'll hit you up when I
have a lead to follow.

03:55.950 --> 03:56.950
Okay, good luck.

03:58.637 --> 03:59.847
Yeah, you too.

04:05.847 --> 04:09.056
Ty. I was helping Ty.

04:09.057 --> 04:10.267
Good.

04:11.427 --> 04:13.136
I like him.

04:13.137 --> 04:15.306
Yeah, me too.

04:15.307 --> 04:16.636
Most of the time.

04:16.637 --> 04:19.812
You know, before I went
Psycho-Mom in your texts,

04:19.837 --> 04:22.626
I actually had some fun last night.

04:22.627 --> 04:25.416
It was just drinks with
the women from group, but...

04:25.417 --> 04:26.836
it was nice.

04:26.837 --> 04:28.706
- You were drinking?
- Yeah, I only had two.

04:28.707 --> 04:31.496
But I let go just a
little, which I needed.

04:31.497 --> 04:33.036
We even danced.

04:33.037 --> 04:35.836
And then this superhot
doctor, he bought us a round.

04:35.837 --> 04:37.497
And he even asked for my number.

04:39.577 --> 04:41.286
What?

04:41.287 --> 04:43.836
Nothing.

04:43.837 --> 04:46.287
No, speak. Please.

04:48.287 --> 04:50.271
Why not a superhot plumber?

04:50.296 --> 04:52.746
A superhot doctor,

04:52.747 --> 04:54.627
another man who can provide.

04:54.652 --> 04:56.191
What is that supposed to mean?

04:56.192 --> 04:57.491
Well, that's why you stayed...

04:57.492 --> 04:59.781
with Dad, right?

04:59.782 --> 05:03.731
Because he kept us in
Chanel and Benzes and benzos?

05:03.732 --> 05:05.861
So who cares if he hits
you every now and then?

05:05.862 --> 05:07.321
I do.

05:07.322 --> 05:09.192
I did then.

05:10.192 --> 05:13.151
I stayed because I was scared.

05:13.152 --> 05:16.861
And I stayed for you, so that you
would have a father who loved you.

05:16.862 --> 05:18.191
- And he did.
- Don't put this on me.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.821
I'm not. It is on me entirely.

05:20.822 --> 05:22.361
I am just trying to explain to you

05:22.362 --> 05:24.991
how complicated it was for me.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.782
And how hard it was to leave.

05:28.862 --> 05:29.942
No.

05:30.902 --> 05:31.941
No, what?

05:31.942 --> 05:35.571
Leaving someone who
hurts you isn't hard, Mom.

05:35.572 --> 05:36.782
You just leave.

05:51.282 --> 05:54.060
<i>Is unwashed produce
putting your family at risk?</i>

05:54.112 --> 05:56.147
<i>Experts have long said that we should be</i>

05:56.202 --> 05:58.151
<i>washing the produce supply...</i>

06:26.692 --> 06:29.781
Tyrone, you shouldn't be
out in public like that.

06:29.782 --> 06:31.492
Connors is back.

06:32.492 --> 06:33.846
What?

06:34.902 --> 06:36.402
What do you mean he's back?

06:37.362 --> 06:39.401
- Are you sure?
- Look, I saw him.

06:39.402 --> 06:41.401
Then he got away and...

06:41.402 --> 06:42.731
Look, we just gotta look for him.

06:42.732 --> 06:44.231
Find him before he finds us.

06:44.232 --> 06:45.901
I... I was thinking we could, uh...

06:45.926 --> 06:47.645
probably check all the places
we know he goes...

06:47.669 --> 06:49.097
"We"?

06:49.122 --> 06:50.886
Yeah. You, me and Tandy,

06:50.910 --> 06:52.807
- we'll all go together.
- No.

06:53.822 --> 06:55.152
No? No, what?

06:57.869 --> 06:59.619
I can't.

07:01.992 --> 07:04.031
I'm not the person that I was.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.691
Tyrone, I'm not who I used to be.

07:05.692 --> 07:06.995
What?

07:08.232 --> 07:10.531
What do you mean? Of course you are.

07:10.532 --> 07:13.020
- All you have to do is...
- I said no, Tyrone.

07:14.942 --> 07:16.362
And I mean it.

07:19.652 --> 07:21.269
You know, the next
time you get mad at me

07:21.294 --> 07:23.821
because I went out and
did something on my own,

07:24.314 --> 07:26.357
remember this moment.

07:26.732 --> 07:28.782
I wish the other you were here.

07:35.577 --> 07:37.611
<i>Hey, I don't know
how you got this number,</i>

07:37.612 --> 07:39.111
<i>but leave a message anyway.</i>

08:53.054 --> 08:55.634
I want to find that bastard
that killed my brother.

09:11.777 --> 09:12.977
Tyrone Johnson.

09:18.817 --> 09:20.107
I've been waiting for you.

09:22.607 --> 09:23.857
I bet you have.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.737
I, uh...

09:32.027 --> 09:33.777
I want to help you.

09:35.477 --> 09:36.857
With what?

09:42.897 --> 09:44.477
With putting me behind bars.

09:50.789 --> 09:53.128
The Farmer looked at the Viper.

09:53.394 --> 09:55.603
He knew it had fangs.

09:55.737 --> 09:59.566
Fangs swollen with poison
that would stop his heart.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.856
He thought it was gonna bite him.

10:01.857 --> 10:03.936
But the Viper...

10:03.937 --> 10:06.027
it didn't bite him.

10:07.937 --> 10:09.896
<i>The cold, you see,</i>

10:09.897 --> 10:13.236
<i>it'd been worse to it
than it had to the Farmer.</i>

10:13.237 --> 10:15.736
<i>It was barely clinging to life.</i>

10:17.119 --> 10:18.422
What the hell is this?

10:18.447 --> 10:20.026
Is this some... some type of set up?

10:20.027 --> 10:21.736
<i>The Farmer could have killed it.</i>

10:21.737 --> 10:24.566
<i>It would have been easy to
ends its life right there.</i>

10:24.567 --> 10:26.821
You want me to pick the gun up so
you can get my prints on it, right?

10:26.846 --> 10:28.337
That's not what I want, Tyrone.

10:28.362 --> 10:29.981
So then tell me what this is all about

10:29.982 --> 10:32.441
before I take you 10 miles off
the coast and leave you there.

10:32.442 --> 10:34.111
<i>But that's not what the Farmer did</i>

10:34.112 --> 10:36.732
<i>because that's not who the Farmer is.</i>

10:40.152 --> 10:42.062
You recognize that gun?

10:43.062 --> 10:44.919
You were pretty young, but...

10:44.943 --> 10:47.136
that's the gun that went off
the night your brother died.

10:47.161 --> 10:48.371
No.

10:49.562 --> 10:52.165
That's the gun you fired
when you murdered him.

10:55.272 --> 10:57.611
When I chased you out of Dwayne's shop,

10:57.612 --> 11:00.111
you hopped the railing.

11:00.112 --> 11:02.611
I found your prints.

11:02.612 --> 11:04.941
And then used this to saw
off the piece of the railing

11:04.942 --> 11:06.821
used to beat Fuchs to death.

11:06.822 --> 11:08.691
The cut patterns will match.

11:08.692 --> 11:10.822
My DNA is all over it.

11:13.652 --> 11:15.271
With them and my confession,

11:15.272 --> 11:17.224
that's almost enough to exonerate you.

11:17.249 --> 11:19.731
And put me in jail.

11:19.732 --> 11:21.941
- But not quite.
- What the hell are you doing?

11:22.168 --> 11:24.048
I mean, what are you really doing?

11:25.772 --> 11:27.562
I'm trying to make good.

11:28.942 --> 11:30.562
I mean...

11:31.402 --> 11:33.997
I don't even know how
I came to be in that...

11:34.822 --> 11:36.731
that other place.

11:36.732 --> 11:38.651
One moment I was...

11:38.652 --> 11:40.691
on a rooftop standing across from you

11:40.692 --> 11:42.022
and the next, I was...

11:46.112 --> 11:48.941
It was a waking nightmare.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.771
Me, alone with my thoughts.

11:50.772 --> 11:53.232
All the things I said and done.

11:54.692 --> 11:56.562
The lies I've told.

11:58.652 --> 12:02.612
The misery I've created
and spread. For what?

12:06.067 --> 12:08.027
I don't even know who I am anymore.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.232
But I know I'm no longer the guy that...

12:17.190 --> 12:19.243
that murdered your brother.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.870
I'm the man who wants to make it right.

12:24.509 --> 12:27.008
- How naive do you think I am?
- What?

12:27.009 --> 12:28.128
I... I don't think you're...

12:28.129 --> 12:29.878
You expect me to believe you've changed?

12:29.879 --> 12:31.378
That you want to make things right?

12:31.379 --> 12:33.298
I can't undo what I've done.

12:33.299 --> 12:35.468
That's for God damn sure.

12:35.469 --> 12:36.969
I'm not here to try.

12:38.169 --> 12:39.589
I swear I'm not.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.468
But that place you put me...

12:42.469 --> 12:44.549
That place...

12:45.669 --> 12:49.008
whatever it was, whatever I was,

12:49.009 --> 12:52.009
I came out of it knowing
what I need to do.

12:52.969 --> 12:55.708
Stop as much of the suffering
I've caused as I can.

13:01.549 --> 13:03.339
And that starts with you.

13:08.509 --> 13:10.839
Sure. What time is the hearing?

13:12.009 --> 13:14.798
Okay. Right.

13:14.799 --> 13:17.339
Okay, I'll see you at the
courthouse at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.548
Hope you've got a good lawyer.

13:22.549 --> 13:23.918
Several.

13:23.919 --> 13:25.588
But they're not for me.

13:25.589 --> 13:27.968
You know, someone rescued a dozen women

13:27.969 --> 13:30.838
from a human trafficking
operation a couple of nights ago?

13:30.839 --> 13:32.338
Are the girls okay?

13:32.339 --> 13:35.008
Various stages of distress.

13:35.009 --> 13:36.878
Some of them in the hospital.

13:36.879 --> 13:39.968
A few of them in jail because
they're too scared to tell the truth.

13:39.969 --> 13:41.298
That's where the lawyers come in.

13:41.299 --> 13:43.798
Well, I'm glad that they
have you on their side.

13:43.799 --> 13:46.709
Apparently, I'm not the
only one on their side.

13:47.839 --> 13:50.968
Some of them recall
the wild story of a girl

13:50.969 --> 13:52.548
who looks like an angel,

13:52.549 --> 13:54.468
a boy who moves like a shadow,

13:54.469 --> 13:56.418
took down the bad guys
and freed all of them.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.468
- That sounds crazy.
- Right?

13:58.469 --> 14:00.088
But it gives me hope.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.008
Angel, shadow, whoever they are,

14:02.009 --> 14:04.169
I'm just grateful that
they're on our side.

14:05.009 --> 14:07.968
- Can I talk to them?
- The angel and the shadow?

14:07.969 --> 14:10.629
No. No, no. The, um, the rescued girls.

14:11.839 --> 14:13.258
Look, my friend...

14:13.259 --> 14:16.968
my cop friend, she thinks
somebody's targeting them.

14:16.969 --> 14:19.588
Taking the women away in ambulances.

14:19.589 --> 14:21.208
Maybe these women know something.

14:21.209 --> 14:22.508
They're victims, Tandy.

14:22.509 --> 14:24.548
Look, I know. I just...

14:24.549 --> 14:26.088
I wanna give them the chance to stop

14:26.089 --> 14:27.508
the assholes who victimized them.

14:27.509 --> 14:28.708
Just a couple questions,

14:28.709 --> 14:30.088
- nothing more.
- Look...

14:30.089 --> 14:32.338
I know you wanna help,

14:32.339 --> 14:33.879
but this not appropriate.

14:35.799 --> 14:39.128
Okay, well, is there anyone
else that might have answers?

14:39.129 --> 14:42.049
That might know
something, anything at all?

14:49.799 --> 14:52.548
I'm sure the women
that this happened to,

14:52.549 --> 14:54.378
don't want to relive this, Tandy.

14:56.299 --> 14:57.758
I'm sorry. I gotta take this.

14:57.759 --> 15:00.284
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

15:00.309 --> 15:01.979
Hey, this is Andre.

15:52.709 --> 15:56.298
It was the pillows, man.
That what finally done us in.

15:56.299 --> 15:58.208
- Pillows?
- Yup.

15:58.209 --> 16:00.168
She'd like to go to that... What is it?

16:00.169 --> 16:04.168
What's that fancy store that's
got the bull's-eye out front?

16:04.169 --> 16:06.048
Target. Yeah, that's it.

16:06.049 --> 16:08.168
Yeah, they got everything. Meats.

16:08.169 --> 16:10.668
Cheeses. Pom Wonderful.

16:10.669 --> 16:12.203
But did she buy any of that? No.

16:12.228 --> 16:14.048
She come home with pillows.

16:14.049 --> 16:16.026
A man's got to rest his head.

16:16.051 --> 16:18.137
Shit, I wish she would catch
you with your head

16:18.161 --> 16:19.548
on one of them sum' bitches.

16:19.590 --> 16:21.884
They strictly for decoration.

16:33.859 --> 16:35.028
Who that is?

16:35.029 --> 16:36.858
It's the home of the Wild
Red Hawks of the 9th Ward

16:36.859 --> 16:38.988
- and if you ain't got no business...
- It's Tyrone!

16:38.989 --> 16:40.279
...Johnson.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.658
Dad.

16:45.659 --> 16:47.778
Son, what are you doing here?

16:47.779 --> 16:50.659
I told you to run as far
as you can, never come...

16:55.029 --> 16:56.949
Dad, Dad. Dad, don't.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.118
Before you do something you may regret,

16:59.119 --> 17:01.569
you may hear what I have to say.

17:03.029 --> 17:04.569
Your son has.

17:24.029 --> 17:25.409
There was this guy...

17:27.489 --> 17:29.819
for some reason he always
sees the best in me.

17:31.909 --> 17:35.158
Expects me to be... good.

17:35.159 --> 17:36.529
It's almost enough.

17:37.909 --> 17:39.858
But not quite.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.948
I could sing like a bird and still
walk away without an indictment.

17:42.949 --> 17:46.408
- Huh?
- Because of my uncle.

17:46.409 --> 17:49.158
- Asa Henderson.
- The state senator?

17:49.159 --> 17:51.659
You know, when we
were on, we were so on.

17:53.635 --> 17:55.039
We took on the whole city.

17:55.064 --> 17:57.618
We're an old, odd, family.

17:57.619 --> 18:00.829
Been here since... Well...

18:00.854 --> 18:03.822
My great-great grandfather
was a founding member

18:03.847 --> 18:06.094
of the Promenade Society
if that gives you an idea.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.723
The place rich white folk go

18:07.724 --> 18:09.353
to talk about how they going to upstage

18:09.354 --> 18:10.742
other rich white folks at Mardi Gras?

18:10.767 --> 18:12.690
A place of power and money.

18:12.729 --> 18:15.143
Parties, drugs...

18:15.144 --> 18:16.807
Even jacked a few people.

18:16.823 --> 18:18.283
A place where crimes are covered up.

18:19.823 --> 18:22.041
I unfortunately know what that's like.

18:23.073 --> 18:24.202
You do?

18:24.203 --> 18:26.242
I have my own share of regrets.

18:26.243 --> 18:28.492
Things I have to live with.

18:28.493 --> 18:30.282
Just like you do.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.812
When Billy was killed...

18:31.837 --> 18:33.087
Murdered.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.572
When I...

18:36.573 --> 18:38.702
When I murdered Billy,

18:38.703 --> 18:40.742
I was looking at prison,

18:40.743 --> 18:43.742
disgrace, losing my badge.

18:43.743 --> 18:45.243
So I called my uncle.

18:46.363 --> 18:49.942
He spent an afternoon at
Promenade Society and after that...

18:49.943 --> 18:51.363
An afternoon?

18:52.679 --> 18:53.968
That's all it took.

18:53.993 --> 18:56.652
He probably put two judges
on the bench as well.

18:56.653 --> 18:59.112
- So he's untouchable?
- Almost.

18:59.113 --> 19:02.743
It seems like your ex
brought out the worst in you.

19:03.903 --> 19:05.282
Not the best.

19:05.283 --> 19:07.573
Is it possible someone can do both?

19:09.943 --> 19:13.282
There is a way to get
to him, to stop him.

19:13.283 --> 19:17.362
Put him and me behind bars.

19:17.363 --> 19:18.652
How?

19:18.839 --> 19:21.629
A file my uncle has hidden away.

19:22.443 --> 19:24.859
He called it the "Monopoly" file.

19:24.884 --> 19:26.543
Why Monopoly?

19:26.568 --> 19:28.694
'Cause it's his "get
out of jail free" card.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.862
And that's exactly
what you need, Tyrone.

19:32.863 --> 19:36.202
Okay, you've identified the problem.

19:36.203 --> 19:38.942
Now, what's the solution?

19:38.943 --> 19:42.914
To face him one last
time and say goodbye.

19:42.939 --> 19:46.862
The dirt he has on
anyone of consequence,

19:46.863 --> 19:48.822
things they don't want known,

19:48.823 --> 19:50.783
things they've done,

19:51.743 --> 19:53.863
or, shit, they haven't done.

19:55.613 --> 19:58.782
Secrets are powerful things
when you know how to use them.

19:59.079 --> 20:00.905
What can I do?

20:08.443 --> 20:10.033
Will you come with me?

20:11.388 --> 20:13.187
Just to stay nearby

20:13.212 --> 20:15.052
in case something goes sideways?

20:19.798 --> 20:21.190
Of course.

20:22.203 --> 20:23.703
I have your back.

21:23.863 --> 21:26.702
The Farmer knew he didn't
want to kill the Viper.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.322
But he also knew

21:28.323 --> 21:30.532
that if he left the Viper there

21:30.533 --> 21:32.652
in the middle of that storm,

21:32.653 --> 21:34.653
it was as good as dead.

21:36.323 --> 21:38.443
It would be the same as killing it.

21:40.653 --> 21:42.999
<i>Faced with a tough choice,</i>

21:43.024 --> 21:45.104
<i>the Farmer made his decision.</i>

21:46.940 --> 21:48.809
<i>He reached out</i>

21:48.874 --> 21:50.964
<i>and picked up the Viper.</i>

21:52.464 --> 21:55.794
<i>He was gonna bring the Viper home.</i>

21:58.754 --> 22:00.663
Your mom done freaking out?

22:00.664 --> 22:04.044
She was and then I freaked
her out all over again.

22:05.044 --> 22:07.413
So, um... We should talk about

22:07.414 --> 22:09.793
- what we should do to find Connors.
- I found him.

22:09.794 --> 22:11.623
You did?

22:11.624 --> 22:13.293
Ty, that's amazing!

22:13.294 --> 22:15.003
Well, we'll see.

22:15.004 --> 22:17.029
He... he told me his uncle can clear me,

22:17.054 --> 22:20.054
but I gotta steal something first, so...

22:20.124 --> 22:22.075
Thank God I know an
honest-to-goodness thief.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.919
Well, I don't know about
honor or goodness, Ty.

22:24.959 --> 22:26.891
- That woman's watching us.
- What?

22:29.747 --> 22:30.972
No. No, she's not...

22:30.997 --> 22:32.519
- She not watching anything.
- No, she is.

22:32.544 --> 22:35.979
Look, I told you meeting
out in public was too risky.

22:36.739 --> 22:38.203
Look, I gotta go.

22:38.204 --> 22:40.504
Hey. No, no, no. Just
stay another minute, okay?

22:42.334 --> 22:44.704
Look, what is going on right now?

22:46.334 --> 22:48.463
Her name is Lia.

22:48.464 --> 22:49.958
She can help me find someone.

22:49.983 --> 22:52.154
I think he ex-boyfriend
might know something

22:52.179 --> 22:54.302
about the scumbags taking those girls.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.947
But in order for her to tell me more,

22:56.972 --> 22:58.432
I need to find some common ground.

22:59.799 --> 23:02.869
So... So who am I? Your
abusive boyfriend or your pimp?

23:02.894 --> 23:04.478
I mean, either one will do.

23:04.518 --> 23:06.147
So you called your black friend?

23:06.148 --> 23:08.384
No. I called my best friend.

23:09.634 --> 23:11.657
Ty, come one. If it were
you, you'd do the same thing...

23:11.704 --> 23:13.147
No, I wouldn't use you or lie to you

23:13.197 --> 23:15.027
or break a promise to help you out.

23:16.853 --> 23:18.906
I didn't break a promise.

23:18.907 --> 23:21.316
You cut me loose. And
you didn't even need me.

23:21.317 --> 23:22.696
You're right.

23:22.993 --> 23:25.759
The way you've been acting,
maybe I don't need you at all.

23:45.197 --> 23:47.776
I'm proud of you.

23:47.777 --> 23:48.907
You did it.

23:53.317 --> 23:55.526
Whatever. It's over.

23:55.527 --> 23:56.817
It's not.

23:57.947 --> 23:59.067
Not for a while.

24:00.947 --> 24:02.197
You know that.

24:04.907 --> 24:06.566
Do you wanna talk about it?

24:06.567 --> 24:08.567
No, it's just...

24:10.357 --> 24:12.617
The things I went
through with him, you...

24:14.697 --> 24:15.907
you wouldn't understand.

24:19.907 --> 24:22.697
Actually, Tandy, I would.

24:24.947 --> 24:28.236
I have a master's degree
in men who use and abuse

24:28.237 --> 24:29.947
and turn your mind inside out.

24:31.777 --> 24:33.697
My ex?

24:34.777 --> 24:36.817
He was everything to me.

24:38.657 --> 24:40.657
I would have done anything for him.

24:42.737 --> 24:44.317
And he took me up on that offer.

24:46.737 --> 24:50.027
One of his big-volume buyers
was looking for a good time.

24:51.447 --> 24:53.407
Eric asked me to deliver it.

24:54.617 --> 24:56.946
Seal the deal.

24:56.947 --> 24:58.197
Oh my God.

25:01.357 --> 25:03.487
Lia, I'm so sorry.

25:04.657 --> 25:06.776
Do you wanna talk about it?

25:06.777 --> 25:08.862
There's no way he's serious, right?

25:08.887 --> 25:11.907
That he's changed and
he regrets what he did?

25:14.133 --> 25:15.832
I don't trust him,

25:15.857 --> 25:18.156
if that's what you're asking.

25:18.157 --> 25:19.906
Not even a little.

25:19.907 --> 25:21.737
The next time he asked, I did it.

25:22.737 --> 25:24.527
And the time after.

25:26.157 --> 25:27.817
And then I said no.

25:30.317 --> 25:32.317
But that's how he saw me now.

25:34.817 --> 25:37.317
He, uh...

25:38.737 --> 25:40.777
He hurt me.

25:41.777 --> 25:43.857
Made me feel...

25:45.960 --> 25:48.199
And he said he'd leave me,

25:48.292 --> 25:49.816
with nothing.

25:49.817 --> 25:53.526
- And yet, people do change.
- Yeah?

25:53.527 --> 25:55.446
Haven't you?

25:55.447 --> 26:00.116
Shit, I've been making
myself a new costume

26:00.117 --> 26:02.906
and it's like nothing that
ever came out of me before.

26:02.907 --> 26:05.066
I had no family,

26:05.263 --> 26:06.979
friends,

26:07.345 --> 26:08.963
no one to turn to.

26:09.947 --> 26:11.857
No one who would speak with me.

26:13.617 --> 26:15.237
So when he asked again,

26:16.357 --> 26:18.697
I said yes.

26:21.157 --> 26:23.317
And every time after that.

26:26.237 --> 26:28.526
Until I found Andre.

26:28.527 --> 26:30.776
What he's done to us...

26:30.777 --> 26:32.856
What he's done to our
family. Doesn't he...

26:33.434 --> 26:35.774
doesn't he deserve...

26:36.987 --> 26:38.617
What?

26:39.617 --> 26:41.736
Finish your sentence.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.361
What does he deserve?

26:45.673 --> 26:47.292
Justice.

26:47.317 --> 26:48.817
Your ex?

26:50.027 --> 26:52.067
I hope he's locked up somewhere.

26:53.697 --> 26:55.816
I hope justice found him.

26:55.817 --> 26:57.697
I agree.

26:59.067 --> 27:01.567
But can you tell me
what that word means?

27:02.777 --> 27:05.406
What the word justice actually means.

27:05.407 --> 27:07.691
Eric? Face justice?

27:08.253 --> 27:10.875
Not when you run the best
growhouse in the city.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.072
A growhouse?

27:14.097 --> 27:15.529
He's right, you know.

27:15.554 --> 27:16.820
Secrets are powerful.

27:18.697 --> 27:20.696
If you had the secrets
he's talking about...

27:20.697 --> 27:22.237
I have a "get out of jail free" card.

27:22.262 --> 27:26.051
A chance to not spend the rest of
your life looking over your shoulder.

27:26.052 --> 27:27.921
Maybe your only chance, son.

27:27.922 --> 27:29.181
It sounds too good to be true.

27:29.182 --> 27:31.342
It also sounds too good to pass up.

27:32.802 --> 27:34.471
Eric's the mainline supplier

27:34.472 --> 27:36.286
for all the drug runners in the city.

27:37.632 --> 27:39.841
Do you think he knew
who was moving the drugs

27:39.842 --> 27:41.690
to sedate the stolen girls?

27:41.715 --> 27:42.970
He knows everybody.

27:44.302 --> 27:45.631
That's his thing.

27:45.632 --> 27:47.341
What if he's lying?

27:47.342 --> 27:50.298
Then that gun he shot Billy with...

27:52.834 --> 27:55.503
is going to be the
last thing he ever sees.

27:55.528 --> 27:57.870
I think about it all the time.

27:57.895 --> 28:02.682
What it would be
like... to make him pay.

28:04.366 --> 28:06.075
Where is that growhouse?

28:06.169 --> 28:08.091
You know what happens
to you if you're lying, right?

28:09.656 --> 28:10.786
I do.

28:11.946 --> 28:13.825
Okay.

28:14.036 --> 28:15.996
Tell me what I need to do.

28:16.986 --> 28:18.286
Well, first you'll need the key.

28:20.826 --> 28:23.616
He keeps the key on him at all times.

28:25.696 --> 28:27.866
Well, almost all the time.

28:29.826 --> 28:33.156
There's one small
window when he doesn't.

28:34.826 --> 28:36.326
When?

28:38.786 --> 28:40.236
When he's in the steam room.

28:43.406 --> 28:45.326
There's a way to get in, but, uh...

28:46.406 --> 28:48.576
you're gonna need a pair of white pants.

29:36.576 --> 29:38.007
Once I have the key?

29:39.446 --> 29:42.302
Then you gotta get to the
place where he keeps the files.

29:44.486 --> 29:46.235
But you can't do that part alone.

29:46.236 --> 29:48.195
You're gonna need help.

29:48.196 --> 29:51.959
And you're also gonna have to
create one hell of a distraction.

29:53.991 --> 29:55.655
There was still some heat left

29:55.656 --> 29:57.458
in the embers of the Farmer's hearth

29:57.483 --> 29:58.946
when he placed the Viper near it.

30:01.236 --> 30:03.735
But he still needed more wood.

30:03.736 --> 30:05.735
So...

30:05.736 --> 30:07.761
he had to go back out into the storm.

30:08.323 --> 30:10.805
- Thanks, yo.
- See you later, Eric.

30:10.830 --> 30:12.869
<i>He nearly froze as he loaded up</i>

30:12.894 --> 30:14.893
<i>as much as he could carry.</i>

30:14.894 --> 30:16.813
<i>Despite his work,</i>

30:16.814 --> 30:19.643
<i>despite what he had done for the Viper</i>

30:19.644 --> 30:22.722
<i>as soon as he stepped through his door,</i>

30:22.776 --> 30:24.871
<i>the Viper bit him.</i>

30:25.734 --> 30:29.603
<i>Filled him with heart-stopping poison.</i>

30:29.604 --> 30:32.103
<i>Those, he knew,</i>

30:32.104 --> 30:34.420
<i>were the very last moments of his life.</i>

30:34.445 --> 30:36.235
Whoa. Excuse me, miss.

30:37.104 --> 30:40.683
- This club is for gentlemen only.
- NOPD.

30:40.684 --> 30:43.024
This facility is the
target of a bomb threat.

30:45.066 --> 30:46.855
We've got a situation.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.129
We've been notified of a
bomb threat on this facility.

30:49.154 --> 30:50.773
We need everyone to
evacuate immediately.

30:50.774 --> 30:52.273
Hold on a minute.

30:52.274 --> 30:55.288
I've heard nothing
about any bomb threat.

31:07.492 --> 31:09.835
I'm sure that if a bomb
threat were credible,

31:09.888 --> 31:11.847
we would have been notified.

31:16.534 --> 31:18.284
I think you just were.

31:58.978 --> 32:00.718
What'd you get lost, little girl?

32:13.848 --> 32:14.977
Security cameras?

32:14.978 --> 32:17.017
Shut down.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.517
You really believe Connors?

32:18.518 --> 32:20.388
No, but either way,
the problem is solved.

32:21.718 --> 32:23.097
If he's telling the truth,

32:23.098 --> 32:24.717
I'm cleared and he goes to jail.

32:24.718 --> 32:26.267
And if he's lying?

32:26.268 --> 32:29.268
Then, like I said,
the problem is solved.

32:30.558 --> 32:32.808
- The clock is ticking.
- We better hurry.

32:40.638 --> 32:42.597
The facility itself is big.

32:42.598 --> 32:45.177
I mean, the lounge, the
restaurant, the gym,

32:45.178 --> 32:46.717
and wine storage.

32:59.768 --> 33:04.347
And that, in his
personal wine storage, number 4,

33:04.348 --> 33:06.427
that is where he keeps the file.

33:53.218 --> 33:55.275
Who's taking all those missing girls?

33:55.353 --> 33:57.097
Wh... What?

33:57.098 --> 33:59.677
Abusive pricks like you
always stay together.

33:59.678 --> 34:01.742
Who's forcing those
girls to turn tricks?

34:01.767 --> 34:03.597
How the hell am I
supposed to know? Wait.

34:03.598 --> 34:06.017
Okay. I do my own thing, okay?

34:08.428 --> 34:10.056
Well, your own thing is over.

34:10.058 --> 34:12.342
Pay off cops, double security,

34:12.367 --> 34:13.786
I can still get to you.

34:15.435 --> 34:17.853
Remember that the next time you
try and pimp out another girl.

34:32.655 --> 34:35.364
Within that special bottle, should be

34:35.364 --> 34:37.695
all the information you
need to clear yourself.

34:48.695 --> 34:52.274
Most think the moral
of the story is simple.

34:52.275 --> 34:55.034
You can never change someone's nature.

34:55.034 --> 34:58.445
A Viper is always a Viper.

34:59.695 --> 35:01.865
But that's not why I'm
telling you this story.

35:03.695 --> 35:06.195
The Viper is not the hero of this story.

35:07.775 --> 35:09.365
The Farmer is.

35:10.825 --> 35:13.654
<i>The Viper represents the worst in us.</i>

35:14.033 --> 35:16.912
<i>The Farmer represents the very best.</i>

35:18.655 --> 35:20.614
<i>Doing the right thing,</i>

35:20.615 --> 35:22.741
<i>even that which might hurt us.</i>

35:24.528 --> 35:26.543
<i>But as good as the Farmer is,</i>

35:26.568 --> 35:30.519
<i>he's nothing compared to the man
we're all here to celebrate today.</i>

35:30.544 --> 35:32.193
Tyrone?

35:32.218 --> 35:33.808
That you?

35:36.826 --> 35:39.705
<i>He is nothing compared to the good</i>

35:39.706 --> 35:42.536
<i>that is at the core of Tyrone Johnson.</i>

35:43.222 --> 35:46.721
So I'd like to propose a toast.

35:46.746 --> 35:48.405
To Tyrone.

35:48.406 --> 35:50.105
My best friend,

35:50.444 --> 35:52.090
port in a storm,

35:52.996 --> 35:54.366
<i>my hero.</i>

35:55.666 --> 35:58.670
<i>- You deserve this, you've earned this.</i>
- Liar!

35:58.695 --> 36:00.075
What are you talking about?

36:00.076 --> 36:01.665
I should have never trusted you.

36:01.666 --> 36:03.444
I should have never listened
to anything you said.

36:03.469 --> 36:05.218
I have no idea what you're talking...

36:05.219 --> 36:08.508
You set me up, huh? Huh? For what?

36:08.509 --> 36:10.758
- What game are you playing?
- There's no game!

36:10.759 --> 36:12.865
Everything is in that file!

36:14.179 --> 36:15.763
There was no file!

36:15.788 --> 36:17.308
I guess you knew that already, right?

36:17.309 --> 36:18.598
The bottle was empty.

36:18.599 --> 36:20.218
You know why I didn't
bring you here first?

36:20.219 --> 36:21.888
Why I brought you to my father?

36:21.889 --> 36:23.428
Because I knew if I was alone with you,

36:23.429 --> 36:25.054
I'd probably just kill you first.

37:35.429 --> 37:36.549
Go ahead.

37:37.549 --> 37:38.980
Just do it, kid.

37:40.679 --> 37:43.098
I'm ready for judgment.

37:43.123 --> 37:44.623
No, no, no. That's not...

37:45.469 --> 37:46.759
I'm not the one who can judge you.

37:51.179 --> 37:52.599
There is someone who can.

38:27.175 --> 38:28.508
Mom?

38:29.549 --> 38:30.705
Mom, are you home?

38:31.719 --> 38:35.178
Tyrone, what are you doing here?

38:35.179 --> 38:37.508
There's someone you need to talk to.

38:37.509 --> 38:39.009
Who? About what?

38:42.009 --> 38:43.638
Him.

38:43.639 --> 38:45.309
About justice.

39:09.099 --> 39:10.429
Are you okay?

39:13.679 --> 39:15.429
Better than the other guys.

39:17.219 --> 39:18.388
What are you doing here?

39:18.389 --> 39:20.178
I couldn't shake it,

39:20.179 --> 39:21.889
the feeling that you
were gonna do something.

39:24.759 --> 39:26.548
What did you do?

39:26.549 --> 39:29.679
Sometimes bullies need someone
to punch them in the face.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.098
He just had too many faces

39:33.099 --> 39:35.311
between him and my
fists than I could count.

39:36.639 --> 39:38.099
You did that for me?

39:39.606 --> 39:41.873
It's all people like him understand.

39:43.132 --> 39:44.527
Strength.

39:44.993 --> 39:46.373
Resistance.

39:47.549 --> 39:49.419
You have to choose to fight back.

39:51.186 --> 39:53.436
You have to refuse to be a victim.

39:56.079 --> 39:57.959
And you have to take away their power.

40:15.665 --> 40:17.625
It sounds like a plan.

41:02.153 --> 41:04.827
I suppose the best place
to start is with a story.

41:07.354 --> 41:10.687
After all, who doesn't
love a good story?
