WEBVTT

03:46.893 --> 03:48.816
Maybe I should learn to fly.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.570
It's not too late, right? I could learn.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.537
What do you like best?
The freedom? The view?

03:58.363 --> 03:59.660
The solitude.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.495
Got it. See you in Sweden.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.503
I only get one shot.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.924
And it has to knock a person back
as well as out.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.927
Which is why
we're perfecting this little beauty.

04:16.047 --> 04:19.096
.45 caliber cartridges,
semi-automatic, each mag

04:21.595 --> 04:23.939
contains eight therapeutic
rounds of dendrotoxin.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.106
In case you miss.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.359
Or have multiple assailants.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.777
We're gonna have
this new Night-Night Pistol

04:32.856 --> 04:34.449
working in no time. Okay?

04:35.233 --> 04:36.951
Great. One thing.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.078
We're not calling it that.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.580
Told you.

04:42.574 --> 04:43.951
Yes, we are.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.251
You seen Skye?

04:45.327 --> 04:46.453
Not since weapons training.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.455
She stop saying "bang"
when she pulls the trigger?

04:48.538 --> 04:50.791
Mostly.
Now if she can just learn the difference

04:50.874 --> 04:53.377
between the safety release
and the magazine release,

04:53.460 --> 04:55.428
we'll be making real progress.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.275
What's up, Phil?

05:08.391 --> 05:10.439
I'd prefer you not call me "Phil."

05:10.560 --> 05:13.439
Okay, you're the boss. A.C.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.276
Just missing my van a bit.
Taking a little me time.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.653
- I want your help with something.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.289
Hit me with it.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.537
You ever rob a bank?

05:25.408 --> 05:26.625
- No.
-An armored car?

05:26.743 --> 05:28.336
- Nope.
-How about a casino?

05:28.411 --> 05:29.412
Should I be offended?

05:29.579 --> 05:31.581
Somebody's stealing
millions of dollars in diamonds.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.168
They found a way to crack
the security systems.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.219
I want you to figure out their exploit.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.547
Hmm.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.635
Yesterday, 55 men, all military,

05:42.759 --> 05:45.433
were hired by one of the largest
gem brokers in the world.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.480
They dressed the men
in identical outfits,

05:47.597 --> 05:49.270
gave each one
a randomly assigned briefcase,

05:49.349 --> 05:52.353
and sent them along 25 different
routes here in Stockholm.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.151
No one knew which briefcase
contained the diamonds,

05:55.272 --> 05:57.366
but they were still stolen.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.777
Why the kabuki theater?

06:00.110 --> 06:02.989
They were afraid because
somebody's targeting diamonds.

06:03.113 --> 06:06.617
An armored car in Milan,
a safe in Monte-Carlo, and now this.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.285
Over 30 mil, total.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.791
Each theft occurred
despite heavy security.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.585
They sound like inside jobs.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.166
A lot of people share that opinion.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.130
You don't.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.096
CCTV cameras catch any of the action?

06:19.170 --> 06:21.798
Fitz-Simmons is checking.
The system went dark for an hour.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.637
They think it was hacked.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.469
It was the same thieves each time?

06:25.552 --> 06:28.226
Yes. But it was just one thief. A woman.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.854
And she did it all with her eyes closed.

06:32.684 --> 06:33.731
Eyewitnesses ID her?

06:34.311 --> 06:37.235
Black, athletic build, late 20s, early 30s.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.191
So you asked how she could've
cracked the system.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.569
I have a pitch,
but it's way outside of the box.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.198
I live outside the box.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.789
There are people in the world
with superpowers, right?

06:46.865 --> 06:48.333
What if this woman
had ESP or something?

06:48.408 --> 06:50.581
There are no credible studies
that support precognition,

06:50.660 --> 06:52.412
telepathy or extrasensory perception.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.747
Okay, so science says no.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.673
But this woman knew impossible things.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.875
And why'd she close her eyes?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.002
That's either random or
totally important.

06:59.419 --> 07:03.890
Was she listening?
Or was she reading minds?

07:07.218 --> 07:09.892
I'm gonna go play with my phone now.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.273
Why does HQ want us to
investigate these heists?

07:16.353 --> 07:19.402
They don't. I picked this op. Any luck?

07:19.522 --> 07:22.025
Yep, I'm getting full bars,
which means if I was down here

07:22.108 --> 07:26.033
and 55 guys were in scary red masks,
you know what I would do?

07:27.364 --> 07:28.786
Instagram.

07:34.245 --> 07:37.044
It's amazing. Every year,
this part of our job gets easier.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.252
Between Facebook,
Instagram and Flickr,

07:40.377 --> 07:42.004
people are surveilling themselves.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.714
With many filters to choose from.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.801
I could do this pretty well
when I was hacking for the Rising Tide,

07:46.883 --> 07:49.932
but you guys tag and search in ways
the rest of us never dreamed of.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.147
I can run facial recognition software
on the photos.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.567
Cross-reference them
with our criminal databases.

07:55.725 --> 07:59.070
You don't have to. That's the thief.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.565
Her name's Akela Amador.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.820
You're certain?

08:02.899 --> 08:05.368
I should be. I trained her.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.538
Akela Amador was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.746
Seven years ago, she led a raid
on one of Vanchat's gulags.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.001
Everyone believed that she

08:17.080 --> 08:19.333
and the two other agents
on the mission were killed.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.174
I had my doubts.
So I sent in a second team, just in case.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.054
They found a lot of carnage,

08:25.130 --> 08:27.428
but couldn't confirm that
any of it was Amador.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.975
Left the possibility open.

08:29.092 --> 08:32.767
That's why you chose this op.
When you heard about the heists.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.518
Only a few women in the world

08:34.597 --> 08:36.520
who could pull off
something so impossible.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.398
Since you were on the bus,
I thought it had to be her.

08:40.602 --> 08:43.152
Swedish Customs confirmed
that Amador left the country

08:43.273 --> 08:45.526
using an alias on a Swedish passport.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.030
She flew into Belarus,

08:47.110 --> 08:49.158
bought a train ticket
to a town called Zloda.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.997
I've also put together a list of individuals

08:51.114 --> 08:52.457
who could fence that many diamonds.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.205
There's been no contact or activity.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.912
Maybe she's saving them
for a rainy day.

08:57.495 --> 09:01.250
Buying something special.
Let's focus on finding Amador.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.176
I'll let HQ know she's alive
so they can assist with the manhunt.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.511
I'd like to hold off on that.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.302
Until we know more.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.811
Contact Belarus authorities.
Find us a place to park the bus.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.898
Put together a list of inns,
hotels and pensiones near Zloda.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.396
There can't be that many of them.
We'll find her.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.739
I'm not so special after all.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.825
I'm not your first protégé.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.954
Relax, I'm teasing.
I know I'm not a protégé.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.157
Hell, I'm not even a real live
S.H.I.E.L.D. agent yet.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.158
You two couldn't be more different.

09:36.117 --> 09:39.838
Amador was smart, talented, fearless.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.831
Wow, there's nothing in common.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.125
Let me finish.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.798
She didn't play well with others.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.010
Found little value in teamwork.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.889
I thought I could
instill those qualities in her,

09:54.010 --> 09:55.227
so I pushed her.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.231
Maybe too hard.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.943
Don't blame yourself because
this chick went to the dark side.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.895
Whatever path she went down,

10:04.020 --> 10:07.866
whatever weird stuff she got into,
it's on her.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.053
The agreement was to come alone.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.554
I did!

10:30.630 --> 10:33.884
What about the man in the next room?
Or the one by the stairs?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.345
They're here to protect me.
For when I leave.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.981
With the merchandise. Please.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.615
I'm sorry. I've never done this before.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.578
May I see them?

11:21.890 --> 11:23.813
- The rest, they are...
-In the bag.

11:23.892 --> 11:27.021
You can carry it through Customs.
No one will know.

11:28.479 --> 11:31.358
Now it's your turn.

11:33.693 --> 11:37.368
When I said $30 million,
I never thought anybody would...

11:37.447 --> 11:40.917
If it fails, I will find you.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.624
It will access all the levels as promised.

11:48.166 --> 11:51.466
But once you're inside,
do you have a plan?

11:53.171 --> 11:54.423
It'll come to me.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.147
How exciting.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.901
I've dreamed of visiting Zloda
since I was a schoolgirl.

12:10.438 --> 12:14.693
Zloda, Belarus?
A dream come true? Really?

12:14.776 --> 12:17.871
It's the birthplace
of Nobel physicist Zhores Alferov.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.493
Technically he's from Vitebsk,

12:19.572 --> 12:20.619
but that's less than an hour from here,

12:20.698 --> 12:22.371
and I'm a bit disappointed
that you didn't know that.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.918
No, of course I know who that is.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.872
Father of heterostructure transistors,
thank you very much.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.957
We're all well aware of that.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.251
I'm just a little bit preoccupied.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.178
First and only other time in the field
wasn't exactly a picnic, was it?

12:34.420 --> 12:36.843
You guys are only here to
search for Amador electronically.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.262
You won't even need to leave the van.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.893
- Bus to short bus.
- Go for short bus.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.313
Next time, I'll decide
what we call ourselves, okay?

12:43.388 --> 12:45.356
HQ has requested
a status update.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.557
What'd you tell them?

12:46.641 --> 12:49.645
That we're tracking a potential suspect.
Nothing more.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.105
- I owe you one.
-More like three.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.829
If Amador's here,
she'll have to contact her buyer.

12:59.904 --> 13:03.329
Scan for cell phone transmissions,
encrypted emails,

13:03.408 --> 13:05.206
anomalous broadcast signatures.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.084
Call us if you find
anything that indicates her presence.

13:08.579 --> 13:11.458
Maintain radio silence
unless you really need help.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.594
- But what exactly defines needing help?

13:15.420 --> 13:18.014
I can only imagine
how painful this must be for you, sir.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.183
Betrayed by someone you trained
and believed in.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.348
We don't have all the facts yet.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.054
True, but I have to assume the worst.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.890
Amador sold out
the other two agents on her mission.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.688
Wonder what she got in exchange.

13:28.766 --> 13:33.067
I don't know. But until we do,
I'm not gonna assume anything.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.190
There's barely electricity in this town.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.025
Can't be too hard to find
our mystery woman.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.493
Unless she already knows we're here.

13:38.568 --> 13:42.289
No. You're not suggesting some sort of
precognition or telepathy because...

13:42.363 --> 13:44.457
I know, it doesn't exist, and not long ago

13:44.532 --> 13:45.829
I would've dumped ESP in

13:45.908 --> 13:49.583
the aliens-and-portals-are-for-
crazy-people pile, but now...

13:50.830 --> 13:51.956
Found a sewer.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.131
- Did you locate Amador?
- What?

14:00.214 --> 14:01.340
No. Not yet.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.635
But we found a broadcast

14:03.718 --> 14:05.595
with some weird signal encrypted into it.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.726
You think Amador might be
communicating on that signal?

14:07.805 --> 14:09.148
Maybe, but I called

14:09.223 --> 14:11.442
with an equally pressing
question for you, my S.O.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.110
What are we supposed to do
if we have to pee?

14:14.854 --> 14:17.277
You broke protocol because
you need a bathroom break?

14:17.357 --> 14:20.110
It was a really, really long drive
and everyone's nervous.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.322
There's a container
at the bottom of the blue chest.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.621
Bottom of the blue chest.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.172
Not the water bottle?

14:33.289 --> 14:34.415
That's the one.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.967
Did you never learn the thing

14:36.042 --> 14:37.919
where boy parts and girl parts
are different?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.424
And our parts aren't penises?

14:39.504 --> 14:41.677
Agent Coulson and I are trying
to find a dangerous criminal.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.224
If there is nothing else pressing...

14:43.299 --> 14:45.347
One last thing. Fitz wants to know
if you packed any snacks.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.349
Yeah, I'm feeling a bit peckish.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.685
Hello? He hung up.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.323
Good afternoon.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.948
I'm Agent Coulson, this is Agent Ward.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.991
We're looking for this young woman.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.241
Oh, she is my angel.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.291
Why do you say that?

15:12.453 --> 15:15.047
She has gift. Knows things.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.341
She told me to go to doctor.

15:18.084 --> 15:21.338
He found a tumor.
I'm having surgery next week.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.680
This girl saved me.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.891
- I can't stabilize it.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.643
There's an encrypted
local signal competing.

15:30.930 --> 15:31.977
Mirror it over.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.899
I have a couple of Rising Tide
exploits that might work.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.193
One last thing.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.198
Ta-da, and you're welcome.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.075
It's very important that we talk with her.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.873
With her gift, I'm sure
she knows you're coming.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.591
Russian TV's kind of boring.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.970
That looks a bit like our van.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.061
What are we looking at?

16:18.895 --> 16:19.987
Us.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.407
Let's get out of here!

16:32.074 --> 16:34.168
Stupid tall person.
Call Coulson. Get the gun.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.589
It's her.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.425
- Safety off.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.087
Bang?

17:02.188 --> 17:04.656
Sir, Amador attacked you
and your people.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.946
Whatever regard you hold for her
isn't reciprocated.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.778
She just kicked us in the teeth.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.746
How's the team?

17:10.820 --> 17:13.290
Rattled. No broken bones.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.618
We're lucky she just knocked the
van over so she could get away.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.464
Probably take a while for
our folks to refocus.

17:20.623 --> 17:23.752
I think I can recover the data signature
of that encrypted broadcast.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.428
I don't understand it yet,
but that's how she was watching us.

17:26.503 --> 17:29.348
Give me an hour.
Maybe we can start watching back.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.229
Something's wrong.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.023
It's the same feed that was
watching us in the van.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.483
Put it on the big monitor.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.278
Maybe the lens broke
when the van rammed us.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.651
I hope she broke more than that.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.997
It's a mirror. Are we recording this?

17:54.740 --> 17:56.083
We are now.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.452
Whoa!

18:00.538 --> 18:02.506
How are we seeing this?
Where's the camera?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.683
It's her eye. She's the camera.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.525
It switches to backscatter
when she closes her eyes.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.404
You're a robot, can you do that?

18:28.524 --> 18:29.525
Who has tech like this?

18:29.609 --> 18:32.488
We don't. Not like this.
Not this small and internal,

18:32.570 --> 18:35.198
that's at least a decade ahead
of anything I've seen.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.833
Though, now that I've seen it,
I could maybe approximate.

18:37.908 --> 18:40.286
The backscatter, X-ray,
a micro transceiver

18:40.369 --> 18:42.963
that somehow doesn't fry her brain,
an internal power source.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.666
All miniaturized. Honestly, it's...

18:44.749 --> 18:45.796
- That's genius.
-...genius.

18:48.711 --> 18:49.837
We have to bring her in.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.388
We have to take her out.
She's a weapon.

18:51.881 --> 18:54.430
I'll call HQ, see if we can
bring a task force in to help us.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.927
Our team can handle this.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.647
I get it. You feel responsible.
Maybe you pushed her too hard.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.979
But she tried
to kill three members of our team.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.814
If she wanted us dead, we'd be dead.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.320
We got lucky.
You wanna risk our lives again?

19:10.399 --> 19:11.901
You told me you were ready for combat.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.112
- That you had my back.
-Don't ever doubt it.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.786
But you are defending this girl
at the expense of the team.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.033
Because we protect our own.

19:19.116 --> 19:22.416
With all due respect, sir,
she's not one of our own.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.588
Guys.

19:28.584 --> 19:29.836
Why does she have
to ask for permission?

19:34.256 --> 19:38.011
She's not being watched.
She's being controlled.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.268
We have to find her.
We'll take shifts watching the feed.

19:41.347 --> 19:44.942
Sooner or later, she'll look at something
that will clue us in to her location.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.778
I'll take the first watch.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.163
I just wanted to give you a quick update.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.503
She's still at the hotel. So...

20:06.038 --> 20:07.460
And that's the update.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.461
It's a pretty weird day, huh?

20:12.128 --> 20:14.347
It's like we were trapped
in a van-shaped piñata.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.136
That should never have happened.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.300
It's okay. it wasn't nearly as terrible

20:18.384 --> 20:20.603
as watching Mom and Dad
fight downstairs.

20:20.678 --> 20:24.524
That shouldn't have happened either.
You regret coming along'?

20:24.849 --> 20:27.227
It's pretty impulsive. Even for me.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.070
I still don't know much about you.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.650
Except for you value really old stuff.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.908
And you value me.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.408
You're the first person to do that
in a long time.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.667
So I happen to believe
you're an excellent judge of character.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.668
If you think this woman deserves
a second chance,

20:52.501 --> 20:53.673
we should give it to her.

20:56.213 --> 20:59.183
Even though she tried to kill me
and I kind of hate her guts.

21:11.854 --> 21:14.403
- Fitz. What happened? Where's May?
-What?

21:14.523 --> 21:17.026
I don't know.
She was watching the transmission.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.695
Amador must be sleeping.

21:18.778 --> 21:19.825
Play it back.

21:23.574 --> 21:26.748
There. She got another message.
Todorov Building.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.878
Wait. Stop.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.462
Can you get closer on that receipt?

21:38.631 --> 21:39.678
Damn it, May.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.386
Wake the others.

21:47.264 --> 21:50.689
Whoever's monitoring you,
do they have audio?

21:50.768 --> 21:53.112
No. But they'll use facial recognition

21:53.229 --> 21:54.902
to determine
you're a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.199
So I don't have to introduce myself.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.321
Did Coulson send you?

21:58.400 --> 22:02.246
No. He feels sorry for you. I don't.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.078
I'll bring you in to S.H.I.E.L.D.,
you'll get a fair trial,

22:05.574 --> 22:07.872
and no one else gets hurt.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.787
You have no idea, do you?

22:09.870 --> 22:11.668
We know that you receive orders.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.499
Then you know that once they see you,

22:13.582 --> 22:15.755
only one of us gets to walk out of here.

22:15.918 --> 22:17.591
They built in a fail-safe.

22:22.508 --> 22:26.763
Either I kill you, or they kill me.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.775
You should've stayed in bed.

23:14.310 --> 23:15.402
Hello, Akela.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.566
You're safe now.

23:25.195 --> 23:29.075
Give it a minute.
I hit you with a powerful dendrotoxin.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.498
There's a kill switch in my eye.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.218
Why hasn't my handler blown it yet?

23:40.336 --> 23:42.634
As far as your handler knows,
you fought Agent May,

23:42.713 --> 23:44.636
you both went down, then you got up

23:44.715 --> 23:46.888
and left the building
to complete your mission.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.726
- How?
-We hijacked your feed.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.474
One of my agents is wearing
a set of glasses

23:53.557 --> 23:55.355
mimicking your implant.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.277
Right now, it's transmitting
his point of view

23:57.353 --> 23:58.821
as if it was yours.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.694
It even has backscatter imaging.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.525
I get messages
from my handler.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.610
We're receiving those as well.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.862
My agent's on his way
to the Todorov Building,

24:07.404 --> 24:08.496
completing your mission

24:08.572 --> 24:10.745
while we disable
the fail-safe in your eye.

24:13.410 --> 24:17.040
I promise they can't see you.

24:18.457 --> 24:22.633
You're okay, Akela. Look at me.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.475
How long
have they been monitoring you?

24:38.727 --> 24:40.104
Years.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.279
Why are you doing this, Coulson?

24:44.400 --> 24:46.744
I need to know why a prox carol
is worth 30 million...

24:46.819 --> 24:50.289
No. Why are you doing this?

24:51.240 --> 24:54.084
Why are you helping me?
Where's the "I told you so"?

24:57.287 --> 24:58.789
That's not me anymore.

25:02.126 --> 25:03.753
I'm just glad you're alive.

25:09.925 --> 25:13.771
Vanchat would've never caught us
if I'd just done my job.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.274
I should've listened to you.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.528
Trusted my team the way you insisted.

25:22.646 --> 25:27.117
If I had, they might still be alive.

25:41.707 --> 25:42.959
Where are we?

25:43.250 --> 25:46.595
Todorov Building.
I think it's research, not military.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.217
Looks like a prison.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.640
- We wireless yet?

25:50.799 --> 25:53.143
Yep. Ready to detach.

25:55.054 --> 25:58.729
Don't look at me.
They need to think you're her.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.019
And, oh, my God, superspy is ticklish.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.480
How'd you
manage to escape?

26:04.563 --> 26:08.033
I didn't.
Got caught in a crossfire. Went down.

26:08.192 --> 26:11.913
Woke up in some half-assed triage bay,
blind in this eye.

26:12.029 --> 26:14.123
Spent the next four years alone

26:14.198 --> 26:16.576
in a cage at
the bottom of a copper mine.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.001
We looked for you.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.796
Heard rumors
you'd been taken to Shanxi province.

26:20.871 --> 26:21.963
When a team finally came,

26:22.039 --> 26:23.757
I thought it was S.H.I.E.L.D.
at first, but...

26:23.832 --> 26:25.175
Who were they?

26:25.250 --> 26:27.844
I don't know, even to this day.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.844
But they were organized.
They took me to a clinic.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.888
I had multiple surgeries,

26:34.051 --> 26:36.554
until one day,
I could see out of both eyes again.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.056
I was so grateful.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.108
Until I realized what they'd done.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.610
Somebody was watching.

26:44.061 --> 26:45.358
My every move.

26:45.854 --> 26:48.403
I had no idea
until they sent the first message.

26:48.524 --> 26:50.572
Then the assignments started.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.120
Mostly it was, "steal this,"

26:53.195 --> 26:55.698
"follow him," "break into there."

26:56.615 --> 26:58.208
I just tried to ignore them.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.958
But when I did, I'd get this pain,

27:02.037 --> 27:04.005
like an electric migraine.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.298
The fail-safe.

27:05.374 --> 27:06.717
Polite way of putting it.

27:09.253 --> 27:14.054
Now when I think about my years
in the cage, I miss it.

27:14.925 --> 27:19.931
I wish I could go back.
Be alone. Sleep in peace.

27:23.559 --> 27:26.483
I know you're tired, but I need your help.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.815
If you want information on the prox card,
you're out of luck.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.695
You can't go on missions without intel.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.653
It comes in pieces. A name, an address.

27:39.408 --> 27:43.754
it would suck to live like this.
Wondering if someone's watching.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.623
Testing backscatter.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.806
Good to go.

27:58.552 --> 28:01.977
Remember, I can't look at you,
much less help you.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.099
Got it. Don't count on you for help.

28:11.607 --> 28:13.109
I'll be watching.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.530
Come on, Akela,
you've never spoken to

28:14.610 --> 28:15.782
or met anyone in person?

28:15.903 --> 28:17.621
No. Only contacts

28:17.738 --> 28:19.661
are the messages I receive
from the Englishman.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.584
The Englishman. Your handler?
How do you know he's English?

28:22.659 --> 28:24.252
The way he refers to certain things.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.922
He uses "lift" instead of "elevator,"

28:26.997 --> 28:28.419
"boot" instead of "trunk."

28:28.498 --> 28:30.967
Think about the messages.
What else do you know about him?

28:31.752 --> 28:35.097
He's late 30s, early 40s.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.804
Uses dated references.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.802
"Disk drive" instead of "flash drive,"

28:39.927 --> 28:41.850
"Burma" instead of "Myanmar."

28:41.970 --> 28:43.472
How's his typing?

28:45.140 --> 28:47.814
Clumsy. Makes a lot of mistakes.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.979
Thick fingers. Maybe heavyset.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.982
I forgot how good you are.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.484
Sir, we're ready down here.

28:58.654 --> 29:00.327
Fitz and Simmons
are prepped for surgery.

29:00.447 --> 29:01.994
Should be any minute now.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.256
Hey, remember, you have man hands,

29:09.331 --> 29:11.425
so don't look when you scan the card.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.672
I know.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.932
Ward's on-site,
so we don't have much time.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.475
To remove her eyeball.

29:20.550 --> 29:23.224
Ocular surgery's not
really my field of expertise.

29:23.303 --> 29:24.646
We've got no other choice.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.564
There's a kill switch inside Akela.

29:26.848 --> 29:29.021
Could be a poison,
could be an explosive.

29:29.184 --> 29:32.233
Either way, if Ward's caught,
they'll kill her instantly.

29:32.729 --> 29:33.855
Where are you going, sir?

29:34.356 --> 29:36.700
To find out whose finger's
on the trigger.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.667
Approaching Delta Three.

29:54.501 --> 29:55.878
Careful! Mirror.

29:57.087 --> 29:58.134
Don't need your help.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.678
Handler's definitely local.

30:02.384 --> 30:03.852
Any idea where he's transmitting from?

30:03.927 --> 30:05.099
Somewhere here.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.731
Every time he sends a message,
we get closer.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.484
Keep me updated on comm three.
I'm headed out now.

30:10.559 --> 30:13.403
I'll track him down if you wanna
stay here and oversee the op.

30:14.187 --> 30:18.237
Thank you. This one's mine.
And about earlier...

30:18.358 --> 30:19.905
Go. Find the guy.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.920
I may need your feedback
during the operation.

30:30.370 --> 30:33.374
Which means I have to inject
a local anesthetic into your eye

30:33.457 --> 30:36.085
rather than putting you under.

30:36.418 --> 30:37.965
Whatever's necessary.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.257
Right.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.057
Let's begin then.

30:59.608 --> 31:00.655
Let me.

31:13.872 --> 31:14.919
What do
they mean, "target"?

31:14.998 --> 31:17.501
It's never good.
Especially for the target.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.008
Let's hope it's a knockout and not a kill.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.129
You should get out of there.

31:21.838 --> 31:25.718
I've come this far.
I'll finish. Whatever it takes.

31:33.683 --> 31:34.730
Help.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.736
I'm sorry, did you say, "help"?

31:40.857 --> 31:43.406
Because a minute ago you said
you didn't want or need my help.

31:43.485 --> 31:47.160
That was before they asked me
to go all Mata Hari on this guy.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.044
I'm just gonna knock him out.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.380
Ward, wait. We may need him
to get through the next door.

31:55.497 --> 31:56.999
Remember, it said seduce, not kill.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.887
I don't think I'm his type.

32:03.004 --> 32:07.350
Let me see. Cheap haircut.
Five o'clock shadow.

32:07.884 --> 32:10.683
Nope, odds are
you guys play for the same team.

32:10.846 --> 32:11.938
You're gonna have to bromance him.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.687
Talk sports. Vodka.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.518
The Victorianov's Secret catalog.

32:16.601 --> 32:19.525
Be friendly, Agent Ward.
Can you be friendly?

32:19.688 --> 32:20.985
Please don't die.

33:07.277 --> 33:08.654
Guess not.

33:26.254 --> 33:29.098
What now? Are you supposed
to grab one of these guys?

34:06.878 --> 34:08.300
They just sent another message.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.553
Coulson, he's close.
Only a few blocks from you.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.509
He's somewhere in Victory Square.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.978
One more message should
lock in his precise location.

34:21.518 --> 34:24.818
Figured out what I needed the guard for.
His password.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.149
Maybe I can talk you through a hack.
Just give me a minute.

34:30.735 --> 34:31.827
No more minutes.

34:34.989 --> 34:37.539
Meet me on the south side
of the building. ASAP.

34:37.867 --> 34:40.996
Got ya. Which Way's south?

35:06.855 --> 35:08.277
Please tell me it's out already.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.741
It's mostly out.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.036
What's wrong?

35:13.111 --> 35:14.203
Nothing.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.458
But Doctor Fitzy needs to step in now.

35:18.783 --> 35:21.787
This is his area of expertise, not mine.
Fitz.

35:34.382 --> 35:37.135
All right then. Most likely both
the power source and kill switch

35:37.218 --> 35:38.640
are located within the eye itself.

35:39.721 --> 35:42.224
So how to disconnect without
triggering the kill switch.

35:43.516 --> 35:44.688
Oh.

35:45.226 --> 35:49.276
I know what to do.
I just need to clarify one thing.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.459
- Ward?
- What?

36:09.751 --> 36:11.628
You sound winded. Is this a bad time?

36:11.795 --> 36:12.842
Little bit.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.764
Well, not so good for me either,
considering I'm holding

36:14.839 --> 36:17.558
a still attached prosthetic eye
that could explode at any second.

36:17.634 --> 36:19.978
Are the wires exposed or shielded?

36:24.307 --> 36:26.526
Cut it now. Cut the wires now!

36:27.727 --> 36:29.570
- What's happening?
-No problem.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.358
Ward explained the sitch.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.540
Coming your way.

36:44.619 --> 36:45.871
I don't know what that means.

37:09.144 --> 37:10.487
- Let's go.

37:14.149 --> 37:16.117
He probably left as soon as
he threw the kill switch.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.320
He's there. 20 meters from you.

37:28.121 --> 37:29.373
I think I got him.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.176
- Excuse me, sir?
-I'm sorry, but I'm very late.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.431
I'm with S.H.I.E.L.D.

37:40.842 --> 37:41.934
Oh, God.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.978
He was a former MI6 officer

37:52.061 --> 37:53.734
who fell off the grid a few years ago.

37:53.855 --> 37:56.278
My handler was as trapped as I was.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.359
Which means
the real threat's still out there.

37:58.443 --> 38:02.073
Big S.H.I.E.L.D.'s still trying to decipher
what was written on that chalkboard.

38:02.238 --> 38:03.660
Nobody's ever seen anything like it.

38:03.740 --> 38:07.119
Couple of people think it might be alien.
Possibly an equation.

38:07.368 --> 38:10.087
Must be important
if it's worth $30 million.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.207
We'll figure it out.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.013
You'll get a fair trial.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.345
I plan on testifying.

38:22.425 --> 38:25.474
I know people.
You deserve a second chance.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.647
You already gave me one.

38:27.722 --> 38:30.396
Doesn't matter how it
plays out from here.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.898
I'm free. Thank you.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.567
Good luck.

38:40.068 --> 38:43.368
What happened to Agent Coulson?
He's different.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.073
Well, he's loosened up a bit.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.079
He nearly died
before the Battle of New York.

38:47.408 --> 38:48.580
But what did they do to him?

38:49.828 --> 38:50.875
I'm sorry?

38:52.997 --> 38:54.249
Never mind.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.809
Are you still needing your you time?

39:04.926 --> 39:07.770
There's always room for A.C.
Slide on in.

39:09.639 --> 39:13.940
What's wrong with "Agent Coulson"
or just "Coulson"?

39:14.018 --> 39:17.443
Nothing, I guess. A.C.'s just way cooler.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.283
'Cause you are. Cool.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.120
Not many people would've
made that call.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.118
Give Amador a second chance.

39:26.823 --> 39:27.949
I got one.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.079
Seems only fair I extend
the same opportunity to others.

39:40.336 --> 39:41.963
I see why you like it in here.

39:42.964 --> 39:46.468
Yeah. It's kinda like my van.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.141
Without all the bums trying to break in.

39:49.637 --> 39:50.729
I don't miss that.

39:53.016 --> 39:54.643
It's more peaceful here.

39:58.396 --> 40:02.902
It's also cool knowing
that someone has my back.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.492
No matter what.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.163
Peaceful's good.

40:38.853 --> 40:39.900
I call.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.492
And raise 100.

40:46.319 --> 40:47.320
Hmm...

40:53.242 --> 40:55.244
You know howl know
I'm gonna beat you?

40:55.495 --> 40:56.792
By losing?

40:58.331 --> 40:59.503
You have a tell.

41:00.833 --> 41:04.303
A physiological tic
that lets me know you're bluffing.

41:06.839 --> 41:09.763
If I watch you carefully...

41:15.306 --> 41:17.183
If I watch you carefully...

41:17.725 --> 41:19.147
Sorry. Hang on.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.531
You know if I do this
that not only will I see Ward's cards,

41:23.606 --> 41:25.984
but I'll see you without any clothes on?

41:27.986 --> 41:29.033
I fold. You win.

41:42.542 --> 41:43.543
Hmm.
