01:54.976 --> 01:57.358
Louise, are you in there?

01:57.393 --> 02:00.223
Can you open the door?

02:00.258 --> 02:03.157
It's Norma Carlisle.

02:06.885 --> 02:09.300
I know you never did
anything I said 20 years ago,

02:09.336 --> 02:11.752
but I wish you'd open the door.

02:37.226 --> 02:39.469
My, my. They've put
in quite an effort.

02:39.504 --> 02:41.402
There's Lois and Jack.

02:41.437 --> 02:43.128
Hello, Norma, Alan.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.474
Lois.

02:47.028 --> 02:48.340
What are we
doing here?

02:48.375 --> 02:50.308
It's a good cause.

02:50.342 --> 02:54.312
My corset's
killing me.

02:54.346 --> 02:56.141
Where's Louise?

02:56.176 --> 02:58.730
Getting ready.
She's first on. I should go.

02:58.764 --> 03:00.214
When does she leave for New York?

03:00.249 --> 03:01.526
Tuesday if she
goes at all.

03:01.560 --> 03:02.906
I thought it was
all set.

03:02.941 --> 03:04.322
So did I,
but Leonard says

03:04.356 --> 03:05.840
she can't go
without a chaperone,

03:05.875 --> 03:07.290
and I suppose she can't,

03:07.325 --> 03:08.878
but we haven't been
able to find anyone.

03:08.912 --> 03:10.328
Well, why don't
you go?

03:10.362 --> 03:12.433
Because I'm giving a 
talk in town next week

03:12.468 --> 03:14.124
and a concert after 
that in Kansas city.

03:14.159 --> 03:15.712
How could I?

03:15.747 --> 03:16.851
Oh, it's a shame for 
her to miss the chance

03:16.886 --> 03:18.336
when she's so gifted.

03:18.370 --> 03:20.096
You must be
very proud.

03:20.130 --> 03:22.063
I'm proud of her,
and she's proud of me.

03:22.098 --> 03:23.444
Zzzzzmmm!

03:23.479 --> 03:25.377
Uh-oh. Leonard's
glaring at me.

03:25.412 --> 03:26.827
Martin, come on.

03:26.861 --> 03:28.035
Can I watch
from here, mom?

03:28.069 --> 03:29.312
No. You're coming with me.

03:29.347 --> 03:31.003
Do I have to? Yes, you have to.

03:31.038 --> 03:34.248
"I'm proud of her,
and she's proud of me."

03:34.283 --> 03:35.939
Can I go home now?

03:35.974 --> 03:37.113
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a moment,

03:37.147 --> 03:38.735
the program will begin.

03:38.770 --> 03:39.943
Please take your seat.

03:46.950 --> 03:49.884
Did I tell you Jack and 
I are joining the klan?

03:49.919 --> 03:51.127
What clan?

03:51.161 --> 03:53.233
The ku klux klan.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.786
You can't be serious.

03:54.820 --> 03:56.132
Heh. Why not?
You must have noticed

03:56.166 --> 03:58.065
what's been going on
since the war.

03:58.099 --> 03:59.722
What do you mean?

03:59.756 --> 04:02.311
Laws, customs, morals--
everything's falling apart.

04:02.345 --> 04:04.899
A decent woman can 
hardly walk down the street

04:04.934 --> 04:07.108
in broad daylight
these days.

04:07.143 --> 04:09.525
But the klan?

04:09.559 --> 04:11.354
Persecuting negroes

04:11.389 --> 04:12.976
with wizards
and bonfires

04:13.011 --> 04:14.702
and hoods with spooky
eye holes?

04:14.737 --> 04:17.774
At least they're interested 
in standing up for purity.

04:17.809 --> 04:18.913
Let's leave it
for now, honey.

04:18.947 --> 04:22.089
Hello, Alan,
Norma.

04:22.123 --> 04:23.297
Oh. Hello, Raymond.

04:23.332 --> 04:24.781
You remember
Ms. Burton?

04:24.816 --> 04:27.059
Oh, I remember Ms. Burton.

04:27.094 --> 04:29.027
Hello, Mrs. Carlisle.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.409
It's good of you
to support this.

04:31.443 --> 04:32.962
It's good of you.

04:35.447 --> 04:37.069
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:37.104 --> 04:39.071
tonight we have
a special treat.

04:39.106 --> 04:40.797
You've all heard
of myra Brooks,

04:40.832 --> 04:43.317
the well-known
Wichita pianist.

04:43.352 --> 04:45.285
Well, this evening,
we have a double helping

04:45.319 --> 04:47.908
of talent as she has
generously consented

04:47.942 --> 04:50.842
to accompany
her daughter Louise,

04:50.876 --> 04:52.430
who has recently
been accepted

04:52.464 --> 04:54.949
to study dance
in New York.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.952
Like thousands
of others.

06:29.768 --> 06:31.736
You ready? Yes.

06:31.770 --> 06:33.393
Yes. Good to
see you again.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.981
Yes, Mrs. Carlisle.

06:36.016 --> 06:37.431
I did not
lose time.

06:37.466 --> 06:39.122
Yes, mother.
Whatever you say.

06:39.157 --> 06:40.952
Just a moment.

06:40.986 --> 06:42.885
Mother, I don't want to do this right now.

06:42.919 --> 06:45.508
I just wanted to say
well done.

06:45.543 --> 06:48.269
I thought your performance
was very exciting.

06:48.304 --> 06:49.788
Exciting?

06:49.823 --> 06:51.376
I assume you're not
from Wichita.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.447
Oh. No. I am.
I am.

06:53.482 --> 06:55.449
A woman from Wichita
who believes

06:55.484 --> 06:57.382
in modern dance?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.384
I may need a chair,
Mrs.--

06:59.419 --> 07:00.730
Carlisle.

07:00.765 --> 07:02.732
This is my husband
Mr. Carlisle.

07:02.767 --> 07:04.078
Yes, he would be.

07:04.113 --> 07:06.184
I was just wondering
what you were saying

07:06.218 --> 07:08.186
earlier about looking
for a chaperone

07:08.220 --> 07:11.016
to accompany your daughter to New York.

07:11.051 --> 07:12.397
Yes?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.882
Well, I'd like to
propose myself.

07:14.917 --> 07:16.470
Honey, don't
you think that--

07:16.505 --> 07:18.127
I would.
I'd like to go.

07:18.161 --> 07:19.335
Norma, dear--

07:19.369 --> 07:20.474
here's my card.

07:20.509 --> 07:22.718
You come and see us
tomorrow.

07:22.752 --> 07:24.098
Please come.

07:34.937 --> 07:38.354
Thank... god.

07:38.388 --> 07:40.390
Ugh.

07:44.878 --> 07:47.777
Don't you think we might 
have talked about it first?

07:47.812 --> 07:50.470
Why?

07:50.504 --> 07:53.058
I want to go.

07:53.093 --> 07:55.198
You really want to go
to New York city?

07:55.233 --> 07:56.890
No. The other
New York.

07:59.099 --> 08:01.032
Well, what
about the boys?

08:01.066 --> 08:02.447
They're not used
to you gone.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.725
They won't mind.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.487
They're too busy
to care what we do.

08:07.521 --> 08:10.351
I hope you won't go
digging around

08:10.386 --> 08:12.733
when you get there.

08:12.768 --> 08:15.805
I'll do what I like.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.462
Think I have
the right, don't you?

08:22.363 --> 08:24.400
By the way, what was
Ms. Burton doing

08:24.434 --> 08:27.714
with Raymond Walker?

08:27.748 --> 08:29.129
How should I know?

08:34.341 --> 08:35.998
Just thought you might,
that's all.

09:07.443 --> 09:10.550
We thought you
were awfully good yesterday,

09:10.584 --> 09:12.275
both of you.

09:12.310 --> 09:14.726
That piano belongs
in a speakeasy.

09:14.761 --> 09:16.452
I'm sorry
about the mess.

09:16.486 --> 09:18.109
Our girl hasn't come
for some reason,

09:18.143 --> 09:21.733
and I've been upstairs
writing all day.

09:21.768 --> 09:24.011
I expect you'd have
cleaned up yourself.

09:24.046 --> 09:26.082
I imagine you're
pretty busy.

09:26.117 --> 09:27.567
Oh, I'm up
to my eyes!

09:27.601 --> 09:29.914
I'm giving a talk
on wagner next week.

09:29.948 --> 09:31.881
How interesting.

09:31.916 --> 09:35.782
Oh! Ohh. Children leave
everything everywhere.

09:37.438 --> 09:41.511
So you think you'd like 
to go to New York with Louise.

09:41.546 --> 09:43.444
Only if it would
suit you.

09:43.479 --> 09:46.102
Oh! It would suit me.
Don't worry about that.

09:46.137 --> 09:48.553
In fact, I'm counting
on you.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.382
I had such a struggle
getting Leonard

09:50.417 --> 09:52.177
to agree to her
going at all,

09:52.212 --> 09:55.008
and then when we couldn't
find anyone to accompany her--

09:55.042 --> 09:56.319
it would have been
such a waste.

09:56.354 --> 09:57.976
I agree. She's
a real artist.

09:58.011 --> 09:59.495
Anyone can see that.

09:59.529 --> 10:01.324
And for Denishawn
to take her on

10:01.359 --> 10:04.811
when she's only 16,
there's the proof.

10:04.845 --> 10:06.329
Denishawn?

10:06.364 --> 10:09.816
It was founded by Ruth St.
Denis and Ted Shawn,

10:09.850 --> 10:13.198
the most innovative
dancers of our time.

10:13.233 --> 10:16.063
You didn't see them when 
they came through here last june?

10:16.098 --> 10:17.237
No.

10:17.271 --> 10:18.790
You missed something.

10:18.825 --> 10:21.793
Shawn and martha graham
were the leads.

10:21.828 --> 10:23.208
They were sensational.

10:23.243 --> 10:24.451
Put that down
right now! I told you!

10:24.485 --> 10:26.004
Mother! Martin: give me that!

10:26.039 --> 10:27.247
Ow!
Ow!

10:27.281 --> 10:28.869
Shouldn't we
investigate?

10:28.904 --> 10:31.389
No need.
She'll come to us.

10:31.423 --> 10:34.047
Mother!
Martin hit me!

10:34.081 --> 10:36.152
It left a mark.
I cannot tolerate

10:36.187 --> 10:39.362
any more of his insolence
and his violence!

10:39.397 --> 10:40.916
Your brother's
insolence and violence

10:40.950 --> 10:43.090
won't be your problem
much longer.

10:43.125 --> 10:46.231
Here's Mrs. Carlisle, come to talk 
about your trip to New York.

10:48.475 --> 10:52.859
Of course.
Hello, Mrs. Carlisle.

10:52.893 --> 10:55.275
Sorry about your arm.
It looks sore.

10:55.309 --> 10:57.726
She's never heard
of Denishawn.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.382
Never mind that.

10:59.417 --> 11:03.732
What do you hope to do
when we get to New York?

11:03.766 --> 11:05.837
I don't know.

11:05.872 --> 11:08.219
I like good theater.

11:08.253 --> 11:10.773
Well, that's something.

11:10.808 --> 11:12.499
I think we're gonna
have a wonderful time.

11:16.054 --> 11:19.506
So I guess it's settled?

11:19.540 --> 11:21.232
I guess it is.

11:23.786 --> 11:25.305
Well, then.

11:25.339 --> 11:26.789
Of course
I don't mind.

11:26.824 --> 11:28.549
Why would I mind?
I think it's great.

11:28.584 --> 11:30.068
Your father was worried.

11:30.103 --> 11:31.483
You don't want to
listen to dad.

11:31.518 --> 11:33.831
This is 1922.
Haven't you heard?

11:33.865 --> 11:35.280
Things have changed.

11:35.315 --> 11:37.213
Women vote now.
They do whatever they want.

11:37.248 --> 11:40.009
Including take a trip
to New York.

11:40.044 --> 11:42.149
Hmm.

11:42.184 --> 11:44.082
Give my regards
to lucy.

11:44.117 --> 11:45.774
How is she?

11:45.808 --> 11:47.499
Very well,

11:47.534 --> 11:49.363
and that is all I have to say on the subject.

11:49.398 --> 11:50.917
Ha ha ha!

11:50.951 --> 11:52.504
Howard, you never told
us what Dr. Winslow said

11:52.539 --> 11:54.092
when he heard you got
into medical school.

11:54.127 --> 11:55.991
Oh, he was very
decent about it.

11:56.025 --> 11:57.475
I'm sure he
was thrilled!

11:59.788 --> 12:02.031
You know, I wanted to be a 
nurse when I was young.

12:02.066 --> 12:03.274
Not a doctor?

12:03.308 --> 12:04.793
Not in those days.

12:04.827 --> 12:06.311
I wrote away
for all these courses.

12:06.346 --> 12:07.865
But you didn't go
through with it?

12:07.899 --> 12:09.211
I was needed
on the farm.

12:09.245 --> 12:11.006
Thank you, della.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.284
Now I'm trusting you
to look after my boys.

12:13.318 --> 12:16.183
All 3 of them.ha!

12:16.218 --> 12:18.323
All 3 of them.

12:18.358 --> 12:20.498
We ought to get going.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.569
Don't worry, mom.
We'll be all right.

12:34.512 --> 12:35.962
All aboard!

12:35.996 --> 12:40.414
Bolton steam to Chicago.
Last call!

12:40.449 --> 12:43.314
Just remember
you're a very lucky girl--

12:43.348 --> 12:45.419
talented
but lucky, too.

12:45.454 --> 12:46.869
I know.

12:46.904 --> 12:48.215
I never had a chance
like this.

12:48.250 --> 12:49.458
So you keep telling me.

12:49.492 --> 12:50.873
Just in case
you're wondering,

12:50.908 --> 12:52.150
if Mrs. Carlisle wants
to come home,

12:52.185 --> 12:53.773
you will come home
with her.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.119
Oh, but, daddy--

12:55.153 --> 12:56.327
you are not staying
on alone in New York,

12:56.361 --> 12:57.811
so you can forget that
right now.

12:57.846 --> 12:59.468
I know we'll
have a good time.

12:59.502 --> 13:01.125
You hear that,
Louise?

13:01.159 --> 13:03.299
You better make sure
Mrs. Carlisle has a good time,

13:03.334 --> 13:04.749
or you are coming home.

13:06.855 --> 13:08.373
Very good.

13:08.408 --> 13:10.997
Appreciate it.thank you.

13:11.031 --> 13:12.757
I checked both trunks.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.139
They should be delivered
the night you arrive.

13:15.173 --> 13:17.313
Let me know
if they aren't.

13:17.348 --> 13:20.109
You should visit
the galleries.

13:20.144 --> 13:21.801
Maybe.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.529
Don't waste your time 
with that other stuff, please.

13:29.463 --> 13:31.120
I should get aboard.

13:34.848 --> 13:37.506
I love you,
you know.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.163
I really do.

13:41.096 --> 13:42.476
That's nice.

13:48.897 --> 13:52.797
I'm going
to Chicago!

13:52.832 --> 13:54.764
Here we go.

13:54.799 --> 13:56.318
Don't want to learn anything 
bad from Mrs. Carlisle, you hear?

13:56.352 --> 13:57.871
I hear.

13:57.906 --> 13:59.424
You work hard.
With what they're charging,

13:59.459 --> 14:01.392
you better come back 
the best dancer in Wichita.

14:01.426 --> 14:03.118
Don't be stupid.
I already am.

14:09.469 --> 14:11.057
Good-bye, Wichita.

14:11.091 --> 14:12.196
I wish I could say
I'll miss you,

14:12.230 --> 14:14.854
but I don't think
I will.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.786
There are people here
from Wichita.

14:23.034 --> 14:26.382
I read that.
So did mother.

14:26.417 --> 14:29.040
You... didn't
like it?

14:29.075 --> 14:30.490
"The house of mirth"
was better,

14:30.524 --> 14:32.802
but historical fiction
bores me.

14:32.837 --> 14:34.252
Oh.

14:34.287 --> 14:36.392
All those ridiculous
rules and manners.

14:36.427 --> 14:39.188
It's just so tedious
and fake.

14:39.223 --> 14:41.087
It won
the pulitzer prize.

14:41.121 --> 14:43.296
She was the first 
woman novelist to get it.

14:43.330 --> 14:46.540
So? And that
so-called hero.

14:46.575 --> 14:48.335
He's in love,
but just because she's divorced,

14:48.370 --> 14:51.960
he leaves her and 
marries a total dummy.

14:51.994 --> 14:53.547
Oh. Did I spoil it
for you?

15:03.143 --> 15:06.491
He's handsome--
Mr. Carlisle.

15:06.526 --> 15:09.115
Thank you.

15:09.149 --> 15:11.013
Do you ever regret
marrying him?

15:11.048 --> 15:12.290
What?!

15:12.325 --> 15:14.120
My mother regrets
marrying my dad.

15:14.154 --> 15:15.328
Who told you that?

15:15.362 --> 15:16.916
She did.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.124
I'm sure she didn't
mean it.

15:18.158 --> 15:19.849
Yes, she did.

15:19.884 --> 15:21.299
Excuse me, Miss.

15:21.334 --> 15:23.957
Would you like me
to lower your window?

15:23.992 --> 15:25.131
I don't mind.

15:25.165 --> 15:26.995
Thank you,

15:27.029 --> 15:29.273
but we'll let you know if
we want our window lowered.

15:36.280 --> 15:40.422
How long before we get
to Chicago?

15:40.456 --> 15:42.113
Next stop Chicago
union station.

15:42.148 --> 15:43.977
Finish that now, Norma.

15:44.012 --> 15:45.772
We're nearly there.

15:45.806 --> 15:49.120
Are you ready, girls?
This is where we get off.

15:49.155 --> 15:50.984
Come on, girls.
Move along.

15:51.019 --> 15:52.986
Norma, hurry up!

15:58.371 --> 16:00.235
Louise?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.065
How are you?

16:03.100 --> 16:04.204
Good to see
you again.

16:04.239 --> 16:05.930
Thank you.
I'm doing well.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.552
Ma'am, table
for one?

16:07.587 --> 16:09.175
No, thank you. Um--

16:09.209 --> 16:10.555
Norma,
over here!

16:10.590 --> 16:12.799
Would you care
to join them?

16:12.833 --> 16:14.007
I guess so.

16:16.527 --> 16:18.978
Ooh!
Ohh!

16:19.012 --> 16:20.496
Ha ha ha!

16:20.531 --> 16:22.326
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.

16:22.360 --> 16:25.294
Let me move along.

16:25.329 --> 16:27.227
Please sit down.thank you.

16:27.262 --> 16:29.816
Ha ha ha!

16:29.850 --> 16:31.921
You were sleeping,
and I was famished.

16:31.956 --> 16:34.338
I had to eat something
before we get to Chicago.

16:34.372 --> 16:37.237
Ma'am?

16:37.272 --> 16:40.240
I'll have the...
lamb stew, please,

16:40.275 --> 16:42.794
and a cup of coffee.

16:42.829 --> 16:44.934
Lamb and coffee.
How interesting.

16:46.591 --> 16:49.008
When I got here,
the tables were all full,

16:49.042 --> 16:51.493
and these gentlemen were 
kind enough to offer me a seat.

16:51.527 --> 16:53.184
Wasn't it nice
of them?

16:53.219 --> 16:54.565
Very nice.

16:54.599 --> 16:57.050
This is Mr. Ross.
This is his nephew,

16:57.085 --> 16:58.500
who's also Mr. Ross.

16:58.534 --> 17:00.812
So isn't that easy
to remember?

17:00.847 --> 17:02.090
Call me joe.

17:02.124 --> 17:03.884
And I'm Norman.

17:03.919 --> 17:05.954
I'm Mrs. Carlisle.

17:05.990 --> 17:08.372
Are you from Wichita,
too, Mrs. Carlisle?

17:08.406 --> 17:10.132
Since my marriage.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.858
And before that?

17:11.892 --> 17:14.377
I grew up on a farm
outside McPherson.

17:14.412 --> 17:16.345
Oh, I think
you'll find New York

17:16.380 --> 17:18.898
a little different
from Kansas.

17:18.934 --> 17:20.762
Heh. I'm from
New York originally.

17:20.798 --> 17:22.317
Oh! Well, then you'll
agree with me

17:22.351 --> 17:24.214
that, uh, they won't
put up with prohibition

17:24.250 --> 17:25.527
for very long.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.148
I think
the temperance people

17:27.184 --> 17:29.427
have overreached
themselves.

17:29.462 --> 17:31.084
Prohibition is stupid.

17:31.119 --> 17:32.810
I couldn't agree
more.

17:32.844 --> 17:35.019
That's because you've never known different.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.780
You've never seen a man
drink up his wages

17:37.815 --> 17:40.921
and forget his family
and his children.

17:40.956 --> 17:43.234
So how old were you when you left New York for Kansas?

17:43.269 --> 17:45.064
Young. I was
quite young.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.997
Well, then you can't have known much different either.

17:48.032 --> 17:51.484
Kansas has been dry
since 1881,

17:51.518 --> 17:54.452
and I don't think you're
over 60.

17:54.487 --> 17:55.971
Ha ha ha!

17:56.005 --> 17:58.042
Ha ha ha!

17:58.077 --> 17:59.526
Lamb stew
for the lady.

17:59.561 --> 18:01.356
Maybe not,
but I've talked to women

18:01.390 --> 18:03.116
who remember
the bad, old days,

18:03.151 --> 18:04.807
and I think there are plenty of wives in New York

18:04.842 --> 18:07.396
who'll be very glad of the change in the law.

18:07.431 --> 18:09.467
Unless they need a drink.

18:09.502 --> 18:14.438
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

18:16.267 --> 18:17.820
Knickerbocker express,

18:17.855 --> 18:19.443
all aboard!

18:19.477 --> 18:22.031
Why can't you just
get on a train in Wichita

18:22.066 --> 18:23.205
and go straight through?

18:23.240 --> 18:24.586
Because you can't.

18:28.003 --> 18:30.039
But we don't change trains again before New York,

18:30.074 --> 18:31.903
so we can have
a good rest.

18:31.938 --> 18:35.562
As long as you don't have some rules that might prevent it.

18:35.597 --> 18:38.979
Louise, I am not
your enemy.

18:39.014 --> 18:41.292
I have not come
along to harass you.

18:41.327 --> 18:43.156
I'm here to
protect you.

18:43.191 --> 18:45.158
What did you think back then when we were having dinner,

18:45.193 --> 18:47.471
that they were gonna
have their way with me

18:47.505 --> 18:49.507
in the--in the dining car
under the table?

18:49.542 --> 18:52.165
A girl your age does not dine with men she doesn't know,

18:52.200 --> 18:53.822
not without
a chaperone.

18:53.856 --> 18:55.341
Why not?
Because it isn't done.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.032
Why not?

18:57.066 --> 18:58.965
Because of the appearance
of impropriety.

19:00.829 --> 19:04.073
Let me put it
to you plainly. Ahem.

19:06.973 --> 19:11.219
Men don't like candy
that's been unwrapped.

19:11.253 --> 19:13.013
What?

19:13.048 --> 19:14.912
Well, maybe
for a lark,

19:14.946 --> 19:17.984
but not for marriage.

19:18.018 --> 19:19.882
The candy may
still be clean,

19:19.917 --> 19:21.194
but if it's unwrapped,

19:21.229 --> 19:22.989
they don't know
where it's been.

19:29.340 --> 19:32.136
Really? Ha ha!

19:32.171 --> 19:34.828
Norma, you sound like
some old latin mama.

19:34.863 --> 19:36.175
Who in the world
taught you that?

19:36.209 --> 19:37.866
I have not said
anything funny.

19:39.626 --> 19:41.939
Have it your own way.

19:53.847 --> 19:55.366
What were your parents
doing in New York?

19:55.401 --> 19:57.230
You said they were
farmers.

19:57.265 --> 19:59.059
They were.

19:59.094 --> 20:01.855
I didn't know them
when I was in the city.

20:01.890 --> 20:04.272
I was an orphan,
and they adopted me.

20:04.306 --> 20:05.963
Why did they come
to New York?

20:05.997 --> 20:09.069
Why didn't they just
find a baby in Kansas?

20:09.104 --> 20:12.832
Well...

20:12.866 --> 20:15.110
in those days,
the children's aid society

20:15.144 --> 20:17.008
used to send the orphans
out on trains

20:17.043 --> 20:19.010
all over america.

20:19.045 --> 20:20.564
People came
to the stations

20:20.598 --> 20:22.876
and adopted us.

20:22.911 --> 20:25.500
You were just
standing there

20:25.534 --> 20:27.053
like a slave market?

20:27.087 --> 20:28.261
Jesus!

20:28.296 --> 20:30.574
Don't swear.

20:30.608 --> 20:32.817
And it wasn't like
a slave market.

20:34.992 --> 20:36.373
The kaufmanns were
wonderful people.

20:36.407 --> 20:39.824
They gave me
a good home.

20:39.859 --> 20:41.792
We didn't have
much money.

20:41.826 --> 20:44.070
We all had to work
on the farm,

20:44.104 --> 20:50.214
but they loved me,
and I loved them very much.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.251
When did you leave
the farm?

20:54.494 --> 20:56.979
They died when I was
quite young,

20:57.014 --> 20:59.085
but soon after,
I met Mr. Carlisle.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.403
Are you happy?

21:06.437 --> 21:08.991
What?

21:09.026 --> 21:12.305
With Mr. Carlisle?
Are you happy with Mr. Carlisle?

21:12.340 --> 21:14.480
Of course I am.
I'm very happy.

21:14.514 --> 21:16.827
You didn't look
so happy.

21:16.861 --> 21:18.518
You were kind of
funny with him.

21:18.553 --> 21:21.590
I don't know
what you mean.

21:21.625 --> 21:25.836
Well, if you don't
want to talk about it.

21:25.870 --> 21:27.044
I'm very happy.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.425
So you said.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.018
I'm putting the light out.
Good night.

21:38.987 --> 21:40.160
Good night.

22:33.421 --> 22:36.803
I think I'm in love
with New York already.

22:36.838 --> 22:38.391
Louise, really.

22:38.426 --> 22:40.497
It's exactly
as I'd imagined it.

22:40.531 --> 22:42.982
I've known all my life that 
this is where I'm meant to be.

22:43.016 --> 22:45.571
Seems very loud to me.

22:45.605 --> 22:48.436
Loud and very crowded.

22:48.470 --> 22:50.161
You wouldn't know
we were on the same planet

22:50.196 --> 22:51.370
as Wichita.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.095
We're not,
thank god.

22:53.130 --> 22:56.547
Hello. I want to go
to riverside drive, please.

22:56.582 --> 22:59.481
Uh, I don't know, lady.
I'll pick up something more central, huh?

22:59.516 --> 23:01.794
My last ride
before I go home.

23:01.828 --> 23:03.451
Please help us,
Mr. Driver.

23:03.485 --> 23:06.385
We're new here in town,
and we would be so grateful.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.007
Sure. Yeah.

23:13.115 --> 23:14.738
Thank you very much.thank you.

23:19.432 --> 23:20.916
Heh.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.750
Ahh.

23:28.614 --> 23:31.306
How did your father
find this place?

23:31.340 --> 23:33.032
I couldn't
tell you.

23:41.385 --> 23:44.077
Ahh. It's not so bad.
I think it's nice.

23:44.112 --> 23:45.803
Compared to what?

23:45.838 --> 23:48.392
Do you mind
sharing a room?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.843
Better than the couch.

23:50.877 --> 23:52.154
Do you want
the first bath?

23:52.189 --> 23:53.742
You have it.

23:55.986 --> 23:57.953
Shall we go and see
times square?

23:57.988 --> 24:00.439
We could take
the subway.

24:00.473 --> 24:03.062
I'm afraid I'm
a little tired.

24:03.096 --> 24:06.997
Ok. Well, is there anything 
you'd like me to get you?

24:07.031 --> 24:08.585
Louise, it's almost dark,

24:08.619 --> 24:10.241
and you have a class
in the morning.

24:10.276 --> 24:12.105
Not till 10:00.
I'll be fine.

24:12.140 --> 24:15.143
I'm sorry, but you are not 
going out by yourself.

24:18.008 --> 24:20.079
Fine. I'll stay in.

24:49.073 --> 24:50.385
Yeah.

24:57.565 --> 25:00.360
This is it.

25:00.395 --> 25:02.155
I feel kind of nervous.

25:02.190 --> 25:04.226
Don't be.
I've seen you dance.

25:04.261 --> 25:05.952
You've got nothing
to worry about.

25:05.987 --> 25:07.885
You're very good really.

25:07.920 --> 25:10.025
I know, but very good
isn't enough,

25:10.060 --> 25:12.269
not for what I want.

25:12.303 --> 25:15.272
Well, you won't get 
any better standing here.

25:15.306 --> 25:18.033
Good luck.
You'll be great.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.911
Sign in at this table, please,

25:33.946 --> 25:37.777
and then find a place 
for yourself on the floor,

25:37.812 --> 25:39.468
and don't dawdle.

25:59.281 --> 26:01.594
Would it be all right
if I had something to eat?

26:01.629 --> 26:05.184
As opposed to what?

26:05.218 --> 26:07.186
Have I seen you
in here before?

26:07.220 --> 26:09.878
No, but I may be a regular

26:09.913 --> 26:11.500
for a while anyway.

26:11.535 --> 26:12.881
Gonna be in the city
for a few weeks,

26:12.916 --> 26:14.400
and we're staying nearby.

26:14.434 --> 26:15.850
Oh. Where you from?

26:15.884 --> 26:18.404
Wichita, Kansas.
What about you?

26:18.438 --> 26:21.131
New York.
Well, Westchester,

26:21.165 --> 26:23.167
but I'm studying law
at columbia,

26:23.202 --> 26:25.791
so I'm staying up
in Morningside Heights

26:25.825 --> 26:27.931
at least until I graduate.

26:27.965 --> 26:31.210
I guess we are both strangers

26:31.244 --> 26:33.246
in this part of the city anyway.

26:33.281 --> 26:35.007
I feel less
of a stranger already.

26:35.041 --> 26:36.422
Oh, that's good.
People like us,

26:36.456 --> 26:39.080
we got to stick together.

26:39.114 --> 26:40.909
I'm Floyd Smithers.

26:40.944 --> 26:42.980
Norma Carlisle.

26:43.015 --> 26:44.637
Heh. Ha ha!

26:44.672 --> 26:46.363
What? Why you smiling?

26:46.397 --> 26:48.261
You remind me
of my sons--

26:48.296 --> 26:54.095
still with everything
to play for. Ha ha ha!

26:54.129 --> 26:55.406
You think I could
look at a menu?

26:55.441 --> 26:56.787
Oh, sure. Sorry.

26:56.822 --> 26:59.031
Heh heh heh.

26:59.065 --> 27:00.308
Right.

27:04.001 --> 27:06.521
And I wonder

27:06.555 --> 27:08.350
could you tell me how 
to get to this address?

27:11.284 --> 27:12.872
What do you need
down on 15th street?

27:12.907 --> 27:15.461
Why? Is it
a bad area?

27:15.495 --> 27:17.359
Well, if I were you,
I would take a cab

27:17.394 --> 27:19.845
and hold on
to your purse.

27:19.879 --> 27:21.432
Oh, and take off
your jewelry.

27:26.852 --> 27:30.303
Welcome, all of you,
to Denishawn.

27:30.338 --> 27:32.581
I am Ruth St. Denis.

27:32.616 --> 27:34.376
Please call me Miss Ruth,

27:34.411 --> 27:39.450
and this is my husband
and partner, Ted Shawn.

27:39.485 --> 27:43.006
By contrast,
you may call me Papa Shawn.

27:44.628 --> 27:48.080
From this moment,
you are ambassadors

27:48.114 --> 27:49.564
for Denishawn,

27:49.598 --> 27:51.635
and just in case
there is any confusion,

27:51.670 --> 27:54.120
just because we are studying
modern dance,

27:54.155 --> 27:56.916
there will be no lapse
of standards.

27:56.951 --> 28:00.540
Young women who are Denishawn 
students wear hats and gloves

28:00.575 --> 28:03.854
and never roll
down their stockings.

28:03.889 --> 28:06.823
Obviously, no drinking
or smoking will be tolerated

28:06.857 --> 28:09.411
on or off the premises.

28:09.446 --> 28:10.965
Obviously.

28:14.934 --> 28:19.111
Dance is a spiritual experience.

28:19.145 --> 28:24.461
Dance is a visualization
of divinity,

28:24.495 --> 28:29.190
a way for you to realize
you are not in your bodies.

28:29.224 --> 28:32.158
Your bodies are inside you.

28:35.506 --> 28:39.372
Now who is familiar
with debussy?

28:41.409 --> 28:42.859
Me. I am.

28:42.893 --> 28:45.171
My mother plays
him all the time.

28:45.206 --> 28:46.932
Lucky you.

28:46.966 --> 28:49.486
All of you, take one
of these squares...

28:51.833 --> 28:53.248
and form a ring.

29:00.359 --> 29:04.156
Now... turn.

29:04.190 --> 29:07.607
That's it. The scarf
is the extension of your breath.

29:09.437 --> 29:11.370
It rises,
and it falls.

29:11.404 --> 29:14.891
Dedans and turn.

29:14.925 --> 29:17.272
And again.

29:17.307 --> 29:18.791
And again.

29:28.283 --> 29:31.045
Who thought that one up?

29:31.079 --> 29:32.356
May I help you?

29:32.391 --> 29:34.462
Oh. Yes. May I speak
to someone?

29:34.496 --> 29:36.809
I used to live here
as a child.

29:36.844 --> 29:38.155
I'm afraid we have
mass now.

29:38.190 --> 29:40.157
You can come back
in an hour.

29:40.192 --> 29:41.952
Couldn't I wait inside?

29:41.987 --> 29:44.161
I've come such
a long way.

29:44.196 --> 29:46.819
Very well.

29:46.854 --> 29:51.928
Girls' choir:

Oh, dear. I'm fine.

30:32.313 --> 30:34.556
Thank you. I was
being a little nosy.

30:34.591 --> 30:37.939
Come and wait in here.
Let me fetch you a chair.

30:37.974 --> 30:39.251
Thank you.

30:44.912 --> 30:49.088
please.
You're very kind.

30:49.123 --> 30:51.815
This room is so much smaller
than I remember.

30:55.301 --> 30:58.270
All the chairs are
so much smaller.

30:58.304 --> 31:01.445
You were one
of the orphans?

31:01.480 --> 31:06.899
Yes, yes.
I suppose I was.

31:06.934 --> 31:08.970
Was your
placement good?

31:09.005 --> 31:10.558
It was, sister.
They were lovely people.

31:10.592 --> 31:12.560
I was very fortunate.

31:12.594 --> 31:15.114
Praise god.
That's nice to hear.

31:15.149 --> 31:16.978
Are you still
with the church?

31:17.013 --> 31:19.187
No, sister.
I'm afraid they weren't catholics,

31:19.222 --> 31:20.879
the people who
took me.

31:20.913 --> 31:23.122
What church do you
attend now?

31:23.157 --> 31:26.022
Presbyterian.

31:26.056 --> 31:27.955
We got wise to what
they were up to.

31:27.989 --> 31:30.336
Now we send out
our own trains.

31:30.371 --> 31:32.373
Children still go out
on trains?

31:32.407 --> 31:34.237
Why? Would you stop
anyone sharing

31:34.271 --> 31:35.963
the advantages
that you had?

31:35.997 --> 31:37.378
No, of course not.

31:37.412 --> 31:42.970
Right. Now what can
I do for you?

31:43.004 --> 31:46.835
I want to learn about 
my birth parents, sister,

31:46.870 --> 31:50.253
who and where
I came from.

31:50.287 --> 31:52.841
I'm afraid I can't
help you with that.

31:52.876 --> 31:55.430
I know you're disappointed,
and I'm very sorry.

31:55.465 --> 31:57.432
Why can't I look
at the records?

31:57.467 --> 31:59.572
Because they're confidential.
Why?

31:59.607 --> 32:02.990
Because no good
can come of it,

32:03.024 --> 32:05.958
and anyway, the likelihood
is your parents are dead.

32:05.993 --> 32:08.340
How would it help
if you knew their names?

32:08.374 --> 32:11.136
Sister Delores,

32:11.170 --> 32:13.276
I want to find out
who I am.

32:13.310 --> 32:17.418
You're a child of god.
You're you.

32:17.452 --> 32:19.213
If they're dead,
how would it help,

32:19.247 --> 32:22.181
and if they're not,
it could cause a bigger problem.

32:22.216 --> 32:23.562
Besides, they won't
want to be found.

32:23.596 --> 32:26.013
How do you know that?

32:26.047 --> 32:28.429
Do you have any idea 
what we're dealing with here

32:28.463 --> 32:30.155
a lot of the time?

32:30.189 --> 32:34.538
Drunks, broken homes, 
adultery, assault. Let it go.

32:34.573 --> 32:36.437
When I was brought here,
I wasn't a baby.

32:36.471 --> 32:38.370
I was walking
and healthy.

32:38.404 --> 32:40.061
My mother must have
known me,

32:40.096 --> 32:41.442
and I'd been cared for.

32:41.476 --> 32:43.099
I remember a woman
holding me

32:43.133 --> 32:46.205
and singing to me
in a foreign language.

32:46.240 --> 32:50.934
Then keep that memory
for what it's worth.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.281
I want to know
who I am.

32:53.316 --> 32:57.251
It's not unreasonable to 
want to know who you are.

33:00.633 --> 33:03.188
You're married,
Mrs. Kaufmann?

33:03.222 --> 33:04.534
Yes.

33:04.568 --> 33:06.294
You look prosperous

33:06.329 --> 33:08.055
as if your husband
has given you

33:08.089 --> 33:12.576
a comfortable and privileged way of life.

33:12.611 --> 33:15.131
Yes, I suppose he has.

33:15.165 --> 33:16.822
Norma, voice-over:
you'll never believe it.

33:16.856 --> 33:18.824
Apparently, it's
next Saturday, not today.

33:18.858 --> 33:22.931
Also, I knocked
on the door, and--

33:22.966 --> 33:24.312
Norma!

33:41.916 --> 33:45.540
I think I might
cut my hair.

33:45.575 --> 33:47.301
Make it different.

33:47.335 --> 33:50.235
Hmm.

33:50.269 --> 33:52.375
Should we ask
your mother?

33:52.409 --> 33:54.032
She wouldn't care.

33:56.655 --> 33:59.589
Can you see
why I love New York?

33:59.623 --> 34:02.316
Hmm. Maybe in a way.

34:04.559 --> 34:09.254
What's the matter?
Is it not what you expected?

34:09.288 --> 34:11.428
I don't know
what I expected.

34:22.438 --> 34:26.478
Open your arms
like a peacock's tail.

34:29.101 --> 34:33.036
Smell the incense.

34:33.071 --> 34:36.971
No, no. Peggy, drop out.

34:37.005 --> 34:39.835
Louise.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.181
Take her place.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.641
Was that
a little unkind?

34:52.676 --> 34:55.886
You tell me to search
for the best.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.578
She's the best.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.479
As long as you're sure.

35:02.514 --> 35:05.931
The girl's a star.

35:05.965 --> 35:07.450
Look at her.

35:29.610 --> 35:32.233
Ha ha ha! Floyd: that's it.
That's better.

35:32.268 --> 35:33.959
How about some whipped 
cream to go with that?

35:33.993 --> 35:36.099
If you're offering.absolutely.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.411
Hi, Floyd.

35:37.445 --> 35:40.414
Oh, hello. I just
got to get...

35:40.448 --> 35:42.140
I was on my way
to fetch you.

35:42.174 --> 35:43.969
They let us go
early.

35:44.003 --> 35:46.144
So I would have just got there 
and found the place empty?

35:46.178 --> 35:47.317
I came back
the usual way.

35:47.352 --> 35:49.181
I'd have seen you.

35:49.216 --> 35:51.390
Want some?
Better not.

35:51.425 --> 35:53.875
My corset's
tight enough as it is.

35:53.910 --> 35:56.154
Why do you wear one?
I don't.

35:56.188 --> 35:57.431
You will
when you're older.

35:57.465 --> 36:01.055
No, I won't.

36:01.089 --> 36:02.850
Shouldn't be here
without asking me.

36:02.884 --> 36:04.990
Here you are.

36:05.024 --> 36:06.992
Mmm.
How is that?

36:07.026 --> 36:08.442
How's it going?

36:08.476 --> 36:11.272
Summer job? Is that enough?

36:11.307 --> 36:13.447
Yes, thank you.
Heh heh.

36:16.381 --> 36:18.624
We should go.

36:18.659 --> 36:20.212
How much will it be?

36:20.247 --> 36:21.903
Don't be silly.

36:21.938 --> 36:23.940
She's right. No charge.

36:23.974 --> 36:27.944
And do your employers know 
you give free food to pretty girls?

36:27.978 --> 36:29.359
Don't worry about that.

36:29.394 --> 36:30.912
I don't worry
about anything.

36:30.947 --> 36:32.535
Let's go.

36:32.569 --> 36:34.122
Bye-bye now.

36:36.159 --> 36:37.885
Do you often
do that,

36:37.919 --> 36:40.336
get people to give you
ice cream for nothing?

36:40.370 --> 36:42.476
But it's not
for nothing, is it?

36:42.510 --> 36:44.892
I get the ice cream, and they 
get the pleasure of my company.

36:44.926 --> 36:47.239
Well, I'm not sure
I should encourage you.

36:47.274 --> 36:48.896
Do you mean I'm
getting fat?

36:48.930 --> 36:50.656
No.
You're right.

36:50.691 --> 36:52.417
They'll only pick a few 
of us to join the company,

36:52.451 --> 36:54.212
and they won't choose
me if I'm fat.

36:54.246 --> 36:55.903
Does your mother know
you want to join the company?

36:55.937 --> 36:57.560
Because she never
mentioned it to me.

36:57.594 --> 37:00.839
I thought it was just a 
course to learn to dance.

37:00.873 --> 37:02.634
Myra said you
wouldn't like it,

37:02.668 --> 37:05.878
to be escorting a professional 
hoochie-coochie girl.

37:07.466 --> 37:09.641
You should have more 
faith in yourself, Norma.

37:09.675 --> 37:11.574
There are plenty
of men out there

37:11.608 --> 37:13.023
who'd be delighted to give 
you some free ice cream.

37:13.058 --> 37:14.611
You just have to ask.

37:14.646 --> 37:16.337
Don't be ridiculous.

37:19.098 --> 37:22.170
♪ Immaculate Mary

37:22.205 --> 37:25.277
♪ your praises we sing

37:25.312 --> 37:28.315

I'm sorry.
The nuns have mass every day at this time.

37:41.914 --> 37:45.090
May I wait inside
like last time?

37:45.124 --> 37:49.197
Sure.

37:49.232 --> 37:53.374
Thank you.

37:53.409 --> 37:56.550
In fact, I meant
to thank you

37:56.584 --> 38:00.657
for being so thoughtful
when I was last here

38:00.692 --> 38:02.521
and today, too, of course,

38:02.556 --> 38:06.422
offering me a chair again.

38:06.456 --> 38:09.977
Sorry about the mess.

38:10.011 --> 38:13.118
Your mess looks so interesting.
What is it?

38:13.152 --> 38:16.017
Well, it was
a wireless.

38:16.052 --> 38:18.434
What happened?
Who knows?

38:18.468 --> 38:20.125
Someone probably
dropped it,

38:20.159 --> 38:21.644
and they
threw it away,

38:21.678 --> 38:25.924
so I thought I would try 
to mend it for the girls.

38:25.958 --> 38:29.410
How nice of you.
So generous.

38:33.656 --> 38:36.003
So why have you
come back?

38:36.037 --> 38:39.213
Oh. Well, here's
the thing.

38:39.247 --> 38:42.423
I've come a long way
from Kansas

38:42.458 --> 38:45.046
to find my records

38:45.081 --> 38:47.497
only to be told
that I couldn't see them,

38:47.532 --> 38:52.019
and I started wondering
if you possibly

38:52.053 --> 38:55.125
might be able to help me.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.369
Are you trying
to be seductive?

38:57.404 --> 38:59.509
Certainly not. No.

38:59.544 --> 39:02.443
If you want a favor, you don't 
need to throw yourself at me.

39:02.478 --> 39:05.343
You've miSunderstood.
I was being nice.

39:05.377 --> 39:09.347
I was just asking nicely for 
something I need, that's all.

39:09.381 --> 39:12.591
You know what?
Come with me.

39:12.626 --> 39:14.455
What?

39:14.490 --> 39:18.079
Come. I'm taking you
for a drink.

39:18.114 --> 39:20.634
Oh, not a real drink.
Just a cup of tea.

39:20.668 --> 39:23.844
Why should i
come with you?

39:23.878 --> 39:26.571
Because you're upset.

39:26.605 --> 39:28.538
Besides, it's
a nice place.

39:31.230 --> 39:32.991
I'm Joseph Schmidt.

39:35.442 --> 39:37.409
I'm Norma.

39:37.444 --> 39:39.584
I was Norma kaufmann
when I was here.

39:43.242 --> 39:45.383
You're right.
This is a nice place.

39:45.417 --> 39:48.386
I would buy you a 
proper drink if I could.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.077
You look as if you need one.

39:50.111 --> 39:52.251
No, thank you.
I believe in prohibition.

39:52.286 --> 39:54.288
Oh. You're in that camp?

39:54.322 --> 39:56.014
I am.

39:56.048 --> 39:58.879
I used to have a beer 
garden in Queens.

39:58.913 --> 40:00.363
It was
a good place.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.228
People would come
with their families.

40:03.262 --> 40:07.232
Anyway, this is not what 
I wanted to talk about.

40:07.266 --> 40:09.924
I wanted you to 
understand why I can't help.

40:09.959 --> 40:12.375
What does it matter
if I understand or not?

40:12.410 --> 40:14.515
It matters to me.

40:14.550 --> 40:16.897
I don't hate the nuns,
you know?

40:16.931 --> 40:18.416
They're kind
in their way.

40:18.450 --> 40:19.900
There are worse places
on earth

40:19.934 --> 40:22.903
than the home
for friendless girls.

40:22.937 --> 40:27.355
I hope so.
My daughter is there.

40:27.390 --> 40:29.150
Your daughter?

40:29.185 --> 40:30.911
I was interned
during the war

40:30.945 --> 40:33.603
as a German
down in georgia.

40:33.638 --> 40:38.021
By the time I got out,
my wife was dead from influenza,

40:38.056 --> 40:40.265
and my daughter had 
been taken into care.

40:40.299 --> 40:44.062
By the nuns.
By the nuns, yes,

40:44.096 --> 40:46.582
but I didn't find
her for months.

40:46.616 --> 40:48.342
When I did,
I had no money,

40:48.376 --> 40:50.482
my business was gone,

40:50.517 --> 40:54.141
so they let me stay on
to fix things.

40:54.175 --> 40:56.108
It's not so bad,

40:56.143 --> 41:00.112
and at least I know
Greta is safe.

41:00.147 --> 41:04.462
So you won't help me because 
you can't risk losing your job.

41:04.496 --> 41:07.465
Greta lost her mother,

41:07.499 --> 41:12.297
and the nuns gave her the only 
security she has ever known.

41:12.331 --> 41:14.230
Why don't you
try writing?

41:14.264 --> 41:16.301
I have. They always
turn me down.

41:20.167 --> 41:23.515
Please. It won't
take long.

41:23.550 --> 41:27.415
I find the file,
I look inside, and that's it.

41:27.450 --> 41:30.315
I'm gone. You won't
ever hear from me again.

41:30.349 --> 41:32.628
I'll leave before they
come out of mass.

41:40.601 --> 41:43.466
You must be out
of here in 20 minutes.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.951
I will lock the door, and you 
must knock when you are done.

41:45.986 --> 41:48.540
I understand.

41:48.575 --> 41:51.992
If they come up,
you will be there till they go to bed.

41:54.891 --> 41:56.997
It's better if you go
in 20 minutes.

42:18.950 --> 42:20.607
Is it locked?

42:20.641 --> 42:22.954
I can get the key if it's where I think it is.

42:22.988 --> 42:25.473
Never mind.
I'll come back later.

42:51.638 --> 42:54.606
Norma, voice-over:
"my name is Mary O'Dell.

42:54.641 --> 42:56.539
"I'm a friend
of the birth mother

42:56.574 --> 42:58.955
"of the girl named Norma,
who was brought here.

42:58.990 --> 43:00.647
"No intention of troubling Norma,

43:00.681 --> 43:02.580
"but any information
would bring her...

43:02.614 --> 43:04.582
"I enclose a self-addressed envelope

43:04.616 --> 43:07.170
"in case you're able
to pass on any news.

43:07.205 --> 43:09.932
With gratitude,
Mrs. Mary O'Dell."

43:21.909 --> 43:23.221
I got it.

43:24.912 --> 43:26.155
Ha ha ha!

43:28.122 --> 43:29.261
You found what you wanted?

43:29.296 --> 43:30.642
I have an address.

43:30.677 --> 43:33.058
I have an actual name
and an address

43:33.093 --> 43:34.404
in Massachusetts.

43:34.439 --> 43:35.889
You should go outside.

43:35.923 --> 43:37.856
Ha ha!

43:37.891 --> 43:40.445
You gave me a bad moment back there.

43:40.479 --> 43:43.897
I gave you a bad moment?
Ha ha ha!

43:43.931 --> 43:46.554
I'm so excited,
and it's all because of you.

43:46.589 --> 43:47.935
You've been so kind
to me,

43:47.970 --> 43:49.212
and you had
no reason.

43:49.247 --> 43:50.904
You took such a risk.

43:50.938 --> 43:53.561
Please. Can I pay you
for what you've done?

43:56.012 --> 43:57.635
No.

43:57.669 --> 44:00.085
Oh, please. I don't
mean to be rude.

44:00.120 --> 44:02.398
I just want to do something 
to show you how grateful I am.

44:02.432 --> 44:06.298
I don't need anything.

44:06.333 --> 44:08.024
How can you live here
with the nuns?

44:08.059 --> 44:09.336
Is that allowed?

44:09.370 --> 44:12.166
I don't,
not exactly.

44:12.201 --> 44:15.169
I have a room up there.

44:15.204 --> 44:17.033
So there's really nothing
I can do for you?

44:19.104 --> 44:21.003
You can tell me
who you are.

44:21.037 --> 44:22.556
You know who I am.

44:22.590 --> 44:25.317
No, I don't.
You may be Norma,

44:25.352 --> 44:29.252
but we both know you 
are not called Kaufmann now.

44:29.287 --> 44:31.220
You don't tell me
where you live.

44:31.254 --> 44:35.189
All you trust me with
is Kansas.

44:35.224 --> 44:38.917
You don't miss
much, do you?

44:38.952 --> 44:41.161
I was called Kaufmann
before I was married.

44:41.195 --> 44:43.473
That's true.

44:43.508 --> 44:45.406
I used it because I've 
written so many times before

44:45.441 --> 44:47.650
in my other name,
I thought they wouldn't see me.

44:50.170 --> 44:52.137
So what will you do
with the letter?

44:52.172 --> 44:54.968
I'll write to the address,
see what happens.

44:55.002 --> 44:56.245
Who knows?

44:56.279 --> 44:58.557
People can surprise you.

44:58.592 --> 45:00.214
They certainly can.

45:02.078 --> 45:03.701
You'll never believe it.

45:03.735 --> 45:06.945
Apparently, it's next Saturday,
not today at all,

45:06.980 --> 45:09.603
so I knocked on the--

45:09.637 --> 45:11.156
oh, god.

45:25.653 --> 45:28.001
You're looking awfully chipper.

45:28.035 --> 45:30.486
Ha ha. Did you have
a good day?

45:30.520 --> 45:33.972
Yes, I did.
Very good, as it happens.

45:34.007 --> 45:36.009
I thought so.

45:36.043 --> 45:38.701
Who are you writing to--
Mr. Carlisle?

45:38.736 --> 45:44.396
No. I'm writing
to an old friend

45:44.431 --> 45:48.366
whom I'd like
to see again,

45:48.400 --> 45:52.542
who just might be able
to come to New York.

45:52.577 --> 45:55.131
What about you?
Was your day good?

45:55.166 --> 45:57.099
Papa Shawn thinks
I could be a star.

45:57.133 --> 45:59.653
I heard him tell
Miss Ruth.

45:59.687 --> 46:02.104
And did she agree?

46:02.138 --> 46:04.244
She agrees
with whatever he says.

46:04.278 --> 46:05.659
Hmm.

46:11.941 --> 46:16.118
Hold, right, left,
right, hold.

46:16.152 --> 46:17.498
We're gonna add an arm.

46:17.533 --> 46:22.952
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

46:22.987 --> 46:26.507
Now the head on 4.

46:26.542 --> 46:28.578
Struggle with the feet.

46:28.613 --> 46:32.444
Ok. You, Louise, show them.

47:10.897 --> 47:12.277
Try it again like that.

47:14.314 --> 47:16.661
We got lucky with that one.

47:16.695 --> 47:18.387
Don't get too lucky, Ted.

47:26.326 --> 47:27.534
We should get
a move on.

47:27.568 --> 47:29.018
We'll be late.

47:30.951 --> 47:34.265
By the way,
I found a church for Sunday.

47:34.299 --> 47:35.922
Why would I want to
go to church?

47:35.956 --> 47:38.062
I thought you were religious.

47:38.096 --> 47:40.547
Someone told me you always 
liked to go to Ed Vincent's class.

47:42.480 --> 47:44.102
Who told you that?

47:44.137 --> 47:45.690
I just heard it.

47:45.724 --> 47:48.106
You heard it?
From whom?

47:48.141 --> 47:49.659
From whom did you hear
this tidbit, Norma?

47:49.694 --> 47:51.903
Aren't you going to tell me?

47:51.938 --> 47:54.043
From Ed's wife, I think.

47:54.078 --> 47:56.114
Effie and I are friends.

47:56.149 --> 47:59.911
Oh? What else did little Effie 
Vincent have to say about it?

47:59.946 --> 48:02.983
Nothing. That you
enjoyed Sunday school.

48:03.018 --> 48:04.571
That's not gossip, Louise.

48:04.605 --> 48:06.193
That's a nice thing
for people to say.

48:06.228 --> 48:08.575
Why are you upset?

48:08.609 --> 48:11.060
I'm not upset.

48:11.095 --> 48:12.855
We have to go,
or we'll be late.

48:25.109 --> 48:26.558
Excuse me.

48:30.114 --> 48:33.496
Norma, they need to
get to their seats.

48:33.531 --> 48:35.257
Oh. I'm so sorry.

48:39.088 --> 48:42.264
Hmm. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

48:50.410 --> 48:52.688
I don't want any trouble,
but aren't colored folks

48:52.722 --> 48:54.966
supposed to
sit in the gallery?

48:55.001 --> 48:57.003
Isn't that the law?

48:57.037 --> 49:00.075
Honestly, Norma.
This is New York, not Wichita.

49:02.732 --> 49:04.700
I said I don't want
to make trouble,

49:04.734 --> 49:07.185
but I don't want them 
to get into trouble, either.

49:07.220 --> 49:08.704
They won't.

49:08.738 --> 49:10.706
Wish I knew what kind
of show this is.

49:10.740 --> 49:13.398
Well, you're about to find out.

49:21.648 --> 49:26.653
♪ Oh, I'm just wild
about Harry ♪

49:26.687 --> 49:31.485

50:07.418 --> 50:10.076
You're right.
I do like New York.

50:10.110 --> 50:13.976
First it seemed so loud
and so crowded, but now,

50:14.011 --> 50:17.980
honestly, it'll be kind of 
dull to go back to Wichita.

50:18.015 --> 50:21.018
"Kind of"?

50:23.020 --> 50:25.953
I'm sorry about how I was
earlier with those people.

50:25.988 --> 50:29.957
I know it's absurd.
I suppose it was the way I was brought up.

50:29.992 --> 50:32.443
Well, shake it off,
Norma.

50:32.477 --> 50:35.170
I don't intend to live 
the way I was brought up.

50:37.068 --> 50:39.036
What do you want,
Louise?

50:41.072 --> 50:43.592
To be the best dancer
in the world.

50:47.147 --> 50:49.149
You think that's
ridiculous.

50:49.184 --> 50:51.151
Not at all.

50:51.186 --> 50:53.671
I like your big dreams.

50:53.705 --> 50:57.364
I think sometimes my 
dreams have been too small.

50:59.366 --> 51:02.369
Did you ever think of 
coming back to New York

51:02.404 --> 51:04.337
to get a job
before you married?

51:04.371 --> 51:06.684
Oh, no.
I was much too young.

51:06.718 --> 51:08.893
I was married
when I was 16.

51:08.927 --> 51:10.688
Wow.

51:10.722 --> 51:13.380
How'd you meet him?

51:13.415 --> 51:16.349
Well, my parents died
in an accident,

51:16.383 --> 51:18.696
and I thought I was
going to lose the farm.

51:18.730 --> 51:22.941
I was staying with a neighbor,
and she hired a lawyer for me and...

51:22.976 --> 51:25.944
that's how I met Mr. Carlisle.

51:25.979 --> 51:27.946
He was the lawyer?

51:30.328 --> 51:33.297
You're an orphan
farm girl who's 16,

51:33.331 --> 51:37.024
a big lawyer comes, takes one 
look at you, and proposes?

51:37.059 --> 51:39.993
I guess.

51:41.167 --> 51:43.341
You must have had something.

51:43.376 --> 51:46.068
Yes, I had something.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.553
Innocence.

51:48.588 --> 51:51.246
I was a complete innocent.

51:51.280 --> 51:54.939
I wish I could say
the same.

51:54.973 --> 51:57.976
Do you, really?

51:58.011 --> 51:59.978
No.

52:00.013 --> 52:01.946
Good.

52:06.571 --> 52:09.195
You have first turn
in the bath.

52:26.039 --> 52:28.524
Do you think
you married too young?

52:28.559 --> 52:31.182
Wouldn't be
without my sons.

52:32.563 --> 52:34.185
16.

52:34.220 --> 52:36.912
When you're 16,
you don't know what you think.

52:36.946 --> 52:39.432
I wouldn't want a husband to teach me.

52:39.466 --> 52:42.435
I had enough of that from my dad.

52:45.472 --> 52:48.165
Sure know what to think
about some things.

52:50.443 --> 52:53.342
I wondered
where I put it.

52:53.377 --> 52:57.070
It was for my brother.
I wrote it when we first arrived.

52:58.347 --> 53:02.109
I'm going to bed.
Thanks, Louise.

53:04.008 --> 53:06.562
You don't like
to argue, do you?

53:06.597 --> 53:11.360
I reckon, when you shout,
you hate yourself for a week after.

53:11.395 --> 53:16.089
I don't believe it achieves 
much to argue and shout.

53:16.123 --> 53:18.091
You're disgusting.

53:18.125 --> 53:21.370
That was vile
and revolting.

53:21.405 --> 53:23.476
I suppose you know 
what it says in the bible.

53:23.510 --> 53:25.961
I do.

53:25.995 --> 53:27.894
And in our home.

53:27.928 --> 53:31.242
How could you bring that 
horrible man into our home?

53:31.277 --> 53:34.245
I shouldn't have done that,
but he isn't horrible.

53:34.280 --> 53:35.591
What?

53:35.626 --> 53:39.388
Raymond is not horrible.

53:39.423 --> 53:41.701
I was, Norma!

53:41.735 --> 53:44.048
When did it start?

53:46.119 --> 53:48.535
At law school.

53:48.570 --> 53:52.988
You mean... you were doing that 
with him before we even met?

53:53.022 --> 53:55.611
I wanted to stop.
I thought that I could.

53:55.646 --> 53:57.993
You do not know
how I tried.

53:58.027 --> 54:00.547
You used me,
all of these years!

54:00.582 --> 54:02.515
You needed a wife.

54:02.549 --> 54:05.172
You thought I was young 
enough and stupid enough

54:05.207 --> 54:08.037
and grateful enough
not to make trouble!

54:08.072 --> 54:12.041
This is why you
never touch me!

54:15.079 --> 54:17.219
What do you want to do, Norma? Me?

54:17.254 --> 54:19.946
I'm not doing anything.
I'm going to Lois and Jack's.

54:19.980 --> 54:21.948
When I get back,
I want you gone--

54:21.982 --> 54:25.227
lock, stock,
and barrel!

54:32.130 --> 54:34.616
I did not think i
would see you again.

54:34.650 --> 54:36.307
Why not?

54:36.342 --> 54:40.000
Because you got what you
came to New York for.

54:40.035 --> 54:42.520
Did they answer
your letter yet?

54:42.555 --> 54:44.211
Not yet.

54:44.246 --> 54:46.213
What happens
if they don't?

54:46.248 --> 54:49.251
I suppose I'll go
back to Wichita.

54:49.286 --> 54:51.218
I hope they do.

54:51.253 --> 54:54.221
I hope it all turns out
like you want it to.

54:54.256 --> 54:56.914
But you don't expect it will.

54:56.948 --> 54:58.916
How pretty.

54:58.950 --> 55:00.400
Would you like one?

55:00.435 --> 55:02.575
Don't spend your money.
I want to.

55:02.609 --> 55:05.302
How 'bout a posey
for your wife, huh?

55:06.648 --> 55:09.616
Thank you.thank you.

55:09.651 --> 55:11.722
That's very generous.
Thank you.

55:11.756 --> 55:15.035
Nonsense.
I have something to celebrate.

55:15.070 --> 55:17.348
What? What do you mean?

55:17.383 --> 55:20.075
You told me you live in Wichita.

55:32.432 --> 55:34.365
Norma.

55:34.400 --> 55:36.919
What are you doing here?
I thought I was coming for you at 10:00.

55:36.954 --> 55:38.714
We finished earlier than
they said we would.

55:38.749 --> 55:41.234
Don't worry.
Two of the boys walked me home.

55:41.268 --> 55:43.340
I hope it was two.
Norma.

55:43.374 --> 55:44.996
They chose me.

55:45.031 --> 55:46.998
They only chose one 
student to join them,

55:47.033 --> 55:49.276
and it was me.
Join them? For what?

55:49.311 --> 55:51.348
To go to Philadelphia
for a performance.

55:51.382 --> 55:53.384
That's wonderful.
Congratulations.

55:53.419 --> 55:55.041
You can come to the 
dress rehearsal if you want.

55:55.075 --> 55:57.561
Of course I want.
We must telegram your mother.

55:57.595 --> 56:00.564
I almost forgot.
This was in the box downstairs.

56:00.598 --> 56:02.289
It must have come
in the last post.

56:02.324 --> 56:04.326
It's from Haverhill,
Massachusetts.

56:04.361 --> 56:06.293
Really?

56:30.283 --> 56:33.251
Mrs. O'Dell?
Mary O'Dell?

56:33.286 --> 56:36.979
I chose the Shakespeare statue,

56:37.014 --> 56:39.154
as I felt we wouldn't
get mixed up.

56:39.188 --> 56:41.156
I was going to say
Christopher Columbus,

56:41.190 --> 56:43.503
but then I realized
there's one in the park

56:43.538 --> 56:46.230
and another at, uh,
Columbus circle.

56:46.264 --> 56:49.026
You're my mother,
aren't you?

56:50.752 --> 56:53.444
You're not a friend of hers.

56:53.479 --> 56:55.446
You're my mother.

56:57.448 --> 57:01.418
There's no point in denying it,
is there?

57:06.319 --> 57:09.287
I don't know where to begin.

57:09.322 --> 57:11.497
How long have you been married?

57:11.531 --> 57:13.499
25 years.

57:13.533 --> 57:15.501
He's a lawyer.

57:15.535 --> 57:18.193
We have twin sons.

57:19.470 --> 57:21.230
Oh!

57:21.265 --> 57:23.232
Howard and Earl.

57:23.267 --> 57:25.442
They look like
fine young men.

57:25.476 --> 57:28.134
You don't know what
a comfort it is

57:28.168 --> 57:30.654
to see how well
you've turned out.

57:30.688 --> 57:33.346
I worried and worried.

57:33.380 --> 57:36.142
I didn't even know
if you had survived.

57:36.176 --> 57:37.661
Well, I did. Heh!

57:37.695 --> 57:39.352
And what were they like,

57:39.386 --> 57:41.630
the Kansas farmers
who took you in?

57:41.665 --> 57:44.184
Kind. They gave me
a happy home.

57:46.186 --> 57:48.637
Thank you for
telling me that.

57:50.397 --> 57:54.056
But... I want
to hear about you.

57:54.091 --> 57:56.093
You're married.

57:56.127 --> 57:58.613
I guess it's not
to my father.

57:58.647 --> 58:01.616
No. I was married at 21,

58:01.650 --> 58:03.687
had you at 18.

58:03.721 --> 58:05.689
And... my father?

58:05.723 --> 58:07.380
Oh!

58:07.414 --> 58:10.072
A boy I met at a dance.

58:10.107 --> 58:13.248
God, I didn't know anything,

58:13.282 --> 58:14.525
nothing.

58:14.560 --> 58:18.253
First time I bled, I
thought I was dying.

58:18.287 --> 58:20.255
And he took
advantage of that?

58:20.289 --> 58:22.257
Oh, did he? No.

58:22.291 --> 58:25.260
He was just as young
and scared as I was.

58:25.294 --> 58:27.262
The minute he heard I was 
pregnant, he took off.

58:27.296 --> 58:29.989
What was his name?

58:30.023 --> 58:32.509
Jack Murphy.

58:32.543 --> 58:35.684
But if you want to search the great west

58:35.719 --> 58:39.412
for a Jack Murphy who came 
from ireland by way of boston,

58:39.446 --> 58:42.104
you got a lot
of interviewing to do.

58:42.139 --> 58:44.175
Where was I born?

58:44.210 --> 58:47.696
The st. Antoinette mission in New York.
It's gone now.

58:47.731 --> 58:50.388
And when did you
leave me?

58:51.631 --> 58:54.116
Oh, you were
6 months old.

58:54.151 --> 58:56.463
They told me
to nurse you that long.

58:56.498 --> 58:58.604
But I thought I was
with you until I was 3.

58:58.638 --> 59:00.951
That's when I was taken
to the orphanage.

59:00.985 --> 59:03.505
Oh. They must have
kept you at the mission.

59:03.540 --> 59:06.404
But I remember
a woman holding me

59:06.439 --> 59:09.097
and singing to me
in some other language.

59:09.131 --> 59:11.099
There were a lot
of foreigners.

59:11.133 --> 59:14.654
Hmm. Some of them
were barren

59:14.689 --> 59:17.381
because of what they 
put themselves through.

59:17.415 --> 59:19.970
They all wanted
to hold you.

59:20.004 --> 59:24.491
And you left me with them
just as soon as you could.

59:32.499 --> 59:34.122
Oh.

59:37.297 --> 59:39.265
I don't expect you
can stay long.

59:39.299 --> 59:42.268
No, not long.
I have to get back.

59:45.961 --> 59:48.723
What happened next
to you?

59:48.757 --> 59:51.726
I went on with my life,
went back to boston.

59:51.760 --> 59:56.316
I told them that I left
the job in New York.

59:57.594 --> 59:59.665
So nobody knows about me?

59:59.699 --> 01:00:01.356
No.

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:03.669
I told no one, so I
could leave you behind.

01:00:03.703 --> 01:00:05.394
Not even your husband?

01:00:05.429 --> 01:00:07.258
No. Oh, no.

01:00:09.157 --> 01:00:11.124
But we've been happy.

01:00:11.159 --> 01:00:13.092
Our two sons are
politicians,

01:00:13.126 --> 01:00:15.646
and our daughter just married 
into a very good family.

01:00:15.681 --> 01:00:18.580
So I have brothers and a sister?
Half.

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.272
Half-brothers
and a half-sister.

01:00:21.307 --> 01:00:23.412
They don't know
about you.

01:00:23.447 --> 01:00:25.622
Nobody does.

01:00:25.656 --> 01:00:28.590
And you're not going
to tell them?

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.557
No.

01:00:35.321 --> 01:00:37.944
Don't worry.
I won't trouble you.

01:00:40.429 --> 01:00:43.432
I wouldn't have come to 
Haverhill unless I was invited,

01:00:43.467 --> 01:00:45.434
and it seems I'm not invited.

01:00:45.469 --> 01:00:47.609
It's "hay-vur-ill,"
just so you know.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:50.543
They don't, uh,
say the second "h."

01:00:50.577 --> 01:00:53.201
Well, now--
I didn't know that.

01:00:53.235 --> 01:00:57.239
I did not know that Haverhill 
is pronounced "hay-vur-ill"

01:00:57.274 --> 01:01:00.277
because until I found
your letter,

01:01:00.311 --> 01:01:02.693
I had no idea that such
a town--this town where

01:01:02.728 --> 01:01:06.041
my mother and my half-brothers 
and my half-sister live--

01:01:06.076 --> 01:01:09.596
I didn't know that such
a town even existed.

01:01:23.403 --> 01:01:26.027
I looked up the statue.

01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:29.513
It was paid for by a benefit 
performance of "Julius Caesar,"

01:01:29.547 --> 01:01:32.965
starring Edwin booth and his brother,
john wilkes booth.

01:01:32.999 --> 01:01:34.932
How interesting.

01:01:34.967 --> 01:01:38.384
The following year,
john wilkes booth shot lincoln.

01:01:40.386 --> 01:01:43.009
I wish things
could be different.

01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:50.534
And I have to go.

01:01:53.433 --> 01:01:55.988
You don't want
my address, do you?

01:01:58.473 --> 01:02:01.476
You don't want to know how 
to get in touch with me.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:05.169
You don't want
to meet your grandsons.

01:02:05.204 --> 01:02:08.448
I'm very pleased
to have seen you.

01:02:19.632 --> 01:02:22.221
Oh, now.

01:02:22.255 --> 01:02:26.259
The sleeper. Oh.

01:02:26.294 --> 01:02:28.917
Oh. Shh.

01:02:31.644 --> 01:02:34.612
You forgot your
lovely flowers.

01:02:34.647 --> 01:02:37.615
Keep them.
I want you to.

01:04:54.235 --> 01:04:56.202
Wonderful.

01:05:10.113 --> 01:05:12.943
That was so wonderful.

01:05:12.978 --> 01:05:16.498
Mrs. Carlisle, may i
have a word with you?

01:05:16.533 --> 01:05:18.466
There's no need
to worry.

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.502
Louise will only be
away for one night,

01:05:20.537 --> 01:05:23.505
and I'll be responsible for her.
That's very kind.

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:27.199
But what I wanted to say is 
that--that if Louise does well,

01:05:27.233 --> 01:05:30.064
we may invite her
to join the troupe.

01:05:30.098 --> 01:05:33.274
My husband believes she
shows great promise.

01:05:33.308 --> 01:05:35.276
He is very much
her champion.

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:37.968
But where would she live?

01:05:38.003 --> 01:05:40.971
We have a boardinghouse
for members of the company.

01:05:41.006 --> 01:05:43.974
The men and women occupy
separate floors.

01:05:44.009 --> 01:05:47.322
And there's a chaperone, naturally.

01:05:47.357 --> 01:05:51.085
So you can probably go home.
You could leave tomorrow, if you like.

01:05:51.119 --> 01:05:54.398
I think I should wait for Ms. St.
Denis to make her decision.

01:05:54.433 --> 01:05:56.642
Certainly. You should.

01:05:56.676 --> 01:05:58.989
We will need time to consider,

01:05:59.024 --> 01:06:01.095
and there's no decision yet.

01:06:10.104 --> 01:06:13.072
Of course, she
will need to prove

01:06:13.107 --> 01:06:15.661
that she can adhere
to the moral, as well

01:06:15.695 --> 01:06:19.182
as the aesthetic code
of Denishawn.

01:06:19.216 --> 01:06:22.737
Art is not tinsel;
art is gold,

01:06:22.771 --> 01:06:26.430
and it must be handled and
delivered by the worthy.

01:06:26.465 --> 01:06:30.365
I have every confidence
in Louise.

01:06:32.367 --> 01:06:36.337
Well, in the words of the prophet,
we shall see.

01:06:36.371 --> 01:06:39.098
So how long you going 
to be in Philadelphia?

01:06:39.133 --> 01:06:40.513
Just one night.

01:06:40.548 --> 01:06:42.964
Think they're trying 
to get your attention.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.966
Excuse me.I'm sorry, sir.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:48.107
What can I get you? Can we please get a...

01:06:48.142 --> 01:06:50.109
I should pack your overnight 
bag when we get home.

01:06:50.144 --> 01:06:51.662
You'll be too flustered
in the morning.

01:06:51.697 --> 01:06:53.112
I won't be flustered.

01:06:53.147 --> 01:06:55.114
No, you probably
won't.

01:06:55.149 --> 01:06:57.116
I would be,
but you won't.

01:06:57.151 --> 01:07:00.361
I keep telling you,
you should be more sure of yourself.

01:07:00.395 --> 01:07:02.156
I agree.

01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:05.469
Are you ok?
You seem kind of down.

01:07:05.504 --> 01:07:08.127
Everything's fine.

01:07:08.162 --> 01:07:10.095
If you say so.

01:07:10.129 --> 01:07:12.097
I'm going to go get
some more cream.

01:07:12.131 --> 01:07:14.133
Let him bring it--
I'll go.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.522
Well, I had a lovely time 
at the boardwalk

01:07:23.556 --> 01:07:25.524
the last time
we were there.

01:07:27.215 --> 01:07:30.218
That club,
it's on 17th street.

01:07:30.253 --> 01:07:32.186
The velvet cat?

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:35.051
I don't know.
I heard that place was kind of rough.

01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:37.363
Louise, stop
bothering Floyd.

01:07:37.398 --> 01:07:41.057
Oh, no,
she's no bother, Mrs. Carlisle.

01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:46.717
What was that about? Nothing.

01:07:46.752 --> 01:07:49.099
Didn't sound like nothing.

01:07:49.134 --> 01:07:51.101
When you finish that,
we'll go.

01:07:51.136 --> 01:07:52.620
You go. I'll be up
in a minute.

01:07:52.654 --> 01:07:54.208
You will come with me now.

01:07:54.242 --> 01:07:55.726
Why?

01:07:55.761 --> 01:07:57.418
Because enough is
enough, Louise.

01:07:57.452 --> 01:07:59.282
Really, enough is enough.

01:08:01.007 --> 01:08:02.457
Ok.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.058
Louise?

01:08:20.613 --> 01:08:22.581
Louise?

01:08:22.615 --> 01:08:24.652
Where are you?

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:49.366
What's happened?

01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:52.058
Have you ever heard of
a club on 17th street?

01:08:52.093 --> 01:08:54.095
I think it's called
the velvet cat.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:55.372
Yes.

01:09:12.009 --> 01:09:13.977
Do you see her?

01:09:14.011 --> 01:09:15.979
There she is.

01:09:17.256 --> 01:09:19.533
Oh! Mrs. Carlisle,
thank god you're here.

01:09:19.569 --> 01:09:22.054
What is going on?
If anything's happened...

01:09:22.087 --> 01:09:24.298
no, nothing's happened to her.
I just want to get her home.

01:09:24.332 --> 01:09:26.058
Ha ha! Oh, no!

01:09:26.091 --> 01:09:28.267
Louise.
Oh, Jesus, not her.

01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:30.442
Get me out of here.
I can't manage her, not now.

01:09:30.475 --> 01:09:32.237
How about
a little politeness?

01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:34.411
She has come
a long way to find you.

01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:38.207
Do you like that,
Norma?

01:09:38.243 --> 01:09:40.728
It's gin. Gin is what it is.
You should try it.

01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:43.420
Maybe you wouldn't be such 
a wound-up pain in the ass.

01:09:43.455 --> 01:09:45.974
All right, that's enough.
We are going home.

01:09:46.009 --> 01:09:47.354
Now!

01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:49.185
Not so fast,
you dirty kraut.

01:09:49.219 --> 01:09:51.462
Maybe the young lady 
doesn't want to leave--oh!

01:09:51.497 --> 01:09:53.499
Easy! Man: all right.
Take it outside.

01:09:53.533 --> 01:09:56.157
Let's go. Oh!
So virile. Ha!

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.159
I'm going to take you both home.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:00.506
Be careful.
She's had a bit.

01:10:00.541 --> 01:10:03.199
Floyd,
she can hardly stand.

01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:04.717
I didn't know
what to do.

01:10:04.752 --> 01:10:06.374
I've never seen a girl drink that much.

01:10:06.409 --> 01:10:08.238
I couldn't get her
to come away.

01:10:21.493 --> 01:10:24.185
That's amazing.
I feel so much better.

01:10:32.297 --> 01:10:34.782
But, Louise, I have
to ask you something

01:10:34.816 --> 01:10:37.440
and you must
answer me honestly.

01:10:39.683 --> 01:10:43.653
Did Floyd take
advantage of you?

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.345
No.

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:49.072
You understand what
I'm saying?

01:10:50.315 --> 01:10:53.697
You haven't been...
compromised?

01:10:55.112 --> 01:10:57.632
He did not compromise me.

01:10:57.667 --> 01:10:59.151
Oh, Louise.

01:10:59.185 --> 01:11:00.635
Oh, Norma.

01:11:02.327 --> 01:11:06.331
Please don't worry about 
me losing my virginity.

01:11:06.365 --> 01:11:10.369
I didn't bring it to lose;
it's back in Kansas somewhere.

01:11:10.404 --> 01:11:11.646
What?

01:11:13.338 --> 01:11:16.064
I told you I wasn't
an innocent.

01:11:16.099 --> 01:11:17.963
But I never
for one moment--

01:11:17.997 --> 01:11:20.310
I guess you ladies of Wichita 
don't know everything

01:11:20.345 --> 01:11:23.037
about my rides
with Eddie Vincent.

01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:26.040
Mr. Vincent,
your teacher,

01:11:26.074 --> 01:11:28.560
who drove you
to Sunday school?

01:11:28.594 --> 01:11:30.320
And so much more.

01:11:30.355 --> 01:11:32.184
What are you saying?

01:11:33.392 --> 01:11:36.568
He took photographs
of me afterwards.

01:11:36.602 --> 01:11:39.295
Louise...

01:11:39.329 --> 01:11:41.262
if this is true,

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.989
if this horrible
thing is true,

01:11:44.023 --> 01:11:46.371
then he must be
reported.

01:11:47.751 --> 01:11:49.650
Really? Why?

01:11:49.684 --> 01:11:51.617
Oh...

01:11:51.652 --> 01:11:53.723
I have to tell
your mother.

01:11:53.757 --> 01:11:56.381
I think she knows.

01:11:56.415 --> 01:11:59.556
She thought I might be 
able to use the pictures.

01:11:59.591 --> 01:12:01.627
Your mother?

01:12:01.662 --> 01:12:04.250
They're not all like marmee
in "little women," you know.

01:12:04.285 --> 01:12:05.493
I know.

01:12:05.528 --> 01:12:07.219
Do you?

01:12:07.253 --> 01:12:09.152
I wonder.

01:12:09.186 --> 01:12:12.155
Being an orphan is such
a big thing for you...

01:12:14.364 --> 01:12:18.334
but if you ask me, I think it gets 
you out of a whole lot of trouble.

01:12:22.096 --> 01:12:25.962
Anyway, let's not stir things up.

01:12:25.996 --> 01:12:30.242
You're always saying that no one wants
a girl when her candy's unwrapped.

01:12:30.276 --> 01:12:32.382
Oh, please forget
about the candy.

01:12:32.417 --> 01:12:35.040
I won't forget
anything.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.768
You poor child.

01:12:38.802 --> 01:12:41.322
All the time I've been lecturing you,
never knowing you

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:44.014
were the victim
of wicked abuse.

01:12:44.049 --> 01:12:46.500
But that's
the point.

01:12:46.534 --> 01:12:49.537
I don't want to be a victim;
not now, not ever!

01:12:54.197 --> 01:12:56.682
I must brush my teeth
and I need to tinkle.

01:12:56.717 --> 01:12:59.513
Can I have
some privacy, please?

01:13:13.699 --> 01:13:16.392
I have breakfast for you
in the other room.

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:22.708
Why'd you wake me?

01:13:22.743 --> 01:13:24.676
Because if you're
late today,

01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:27.023
Miss Ruth won't let you
go to Philadelphia,

01:13:27.057 --> 01:13:30.060
and you won't be able
to join the troupe.

01:13:30.095 --> 01:13:32.546
Tell her I'm sick.
It's true.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:36.550
She won't care, and papa Ted 
won't be able to protect you.

01:13:38.586 --> 01:13:41.244
Mmm. Ok.

01:13:41.278 --> 01:13:43.280
So get up.
You mustn't put

01:13:43.315 --> 01:13:45.282
everything you want at risk.

01:13:45.317 --> 01:13:47.284
I'm not packed.

01:13:47.319 --> 01:13:49.425
I'll pack.

01:13:58.606 --> 01:14:00.574
Louise...

01:14:00.608 --> 01:14:02.541
I can't help
worrying

01:14:02.576 --> 01:14:05.268
about what you told me last night.

01:14:05.302 --> 01:14:08.271
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:14:08.305 --> 01:14:10.273
Mr. Vincent.

01:14:10.307 --> 01:14:12.724
I can't overlook it.

01:14:12.758 --> 01:14:15.727
One word, and I'll deny everything;
so will mother.

01:14:15.761 --> 01:14:18.730
You'll just make
yourself look crazy.

01:14:18.764 --> 01:14:21.457
Are you planning to say 
anything to Miss Ruth?

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:24.460
Of course not. Why would I?
I don't want to ruin your career.

01:14:24.494 --> 01:14:26.462
I don't have a career.

01:14:26.496 --> 01:14:28.153
Maybe not yet,
but you can have one.

01:14:28.187 --> 01:14:30.327
You're good. Louise,
you're very good.

01:14:30.362 --> 01:14:32.364
No one can take that
away from you.

01:14:32.398 --> 01:14:34.021
Really?

01:14:34.055 --> 01:14:35.505
Yes, really.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.507
I know you're pretty
and the boys like you,

01:14:37.542 --> 01:14:39.544
but you got more
than that.

01:14:39.578 --> 01:14:41.235
You got talent.

01:14:41.269 --> 01:14:43.202
Talent gives you power.

01:14:43.237 --> 01:14:46.205
People can try to stop you,
but they can't take away your talent.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.414
Nobody can do that.

01:14:48.449 --> 01:14:50.382
Thank you.

01:14:50.416 --> 01:14:52.384
You're welcome.

01:14:52.418 --> 01:14:54.628
Better get in there.

01:14:56.181 --> 01:14:58.632
Wish me luck.
Good luck.

01:15:07.088 --> 01:15:09.056
Mrs. Carlisle?

01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:11.023
Floyd.

01:15:11.058 --> 01:15:13.060
Please, Mrs. Carlisle,
I know you're sore,

01:15:13.094 --> 01:15:15.027
but I'm truly sorry,
honest.

01:15:15.062 --> 01:15:18.065
You shouldn't have had 
her sneak out like that.

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:23.726
Floyd...

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.523
you're a nice young man,
and I think you'll go far.

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:30.077
You're like me; we're
both kind of Normal.

01:15:30.111 --> 01:15:32.458
What we want from life
is achievable.

01:15:32.493 --> 01:15:34.978
I'm not sure Louise
is like that.

01:15:35.013 --> 01:15:38.534
I think about her all the time, Mrs.
Carlisle, all the time.

01:15:38.568 --> 01:15:42.261
She's the prettiest girl
I've ever seen, by far.

01:15:42.296 --> 01:15:44.747
And she's kind of...

01:15:44.781 --> 01:15:47.612
fascinating,
you know what I mean?

01:15:47.646 --> 01:15:51.132
I certainly do,
but if I were you,

01:15:51.167 --> 01:15:53.134
I should let her be
a wonderful memory;

01:15:53.169 --> 01:15:55.136
you'll be a lot
happier that way,

01:15:55.171 --> 01:15:57.138
believe me.

01:16:00.072 --> 01:16:04.594
I bet you're glad you're too old 
to mess with this stuff... right?

01:16:06.665 --> 01:16:09.323
Sure you wouldn't like 
some coffee, Mrs. Carlisle?

01:16:09.357 --> 01:16:12.671
No, thank you, betty. You're very kind,
but I won't be staying long.

01:16:12.706 --> 01:16:14.673
Thank you, betty.

01:16:14.708 --> 01:16:17.676
I hope you'll stay
long enough

01:16:17.711 --> 01:16:19.713
to have a grown-up
conversation.

01:16:19.747 --> 01:16:23.130
Is that why we're here, so I won't 
shout and throw a glass vase?

01:16:23.164 --> 01:16:25.132
I like to think so.

01:16:26.651 --> 01:16:28.791
You know, there isn't
a judge in the county

01:16:28.825 --> 01:16:31.172
that won't give me
a divorce.

01:16:31.207 --> 01:16:33.140
And when he does,

01:16:33.174 --> 01:16:35.694
I'll not only be ruined,
I'll probably be dead.

01:16:35.729 --> 01:16:38.248
There are people
in this town

01:16:38.283 --> 01:16:40.216
who would have me
killed if they knew.

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:43.219
You should have thought 
of that a little earlier.

01:16:43.253 --> 01:16:47.257
And how will you and the boys 
live when I've been murdered?

01:16:47.292 --> 01:16:50.778
Then I'll cite your infidelity and...

01:16:50.813 --> 01:16:53.298
you can support us.

01:16:53.332 --> 01:16:55.783
Is it what you want?

01:16:55.818 --> 01:16:59.338
"There's Norma Carlisle.
She's divorced, you know."

01:17:02.479 --> 01:17:04.447
What's Raymond
planning to do?

01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:07.657
He was talking
about selling up,

01:17:07.692 --> 01:17:09.625
moving on.

01:17:11.454 --> 01:17:14.112
But you don't
want him to.

01:17:16.183 --> 01:17:18.116
No, I don't.

01:17:20.152 --> 01:17:22.292
You wish I had died

01:17:22.327 --> 01:17:24.467
when the twins
were born.

01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:26.780
Then you could have
played the sad widower

01:17:26.814 --> 01:17:29.334
with no one to get
in your way.

01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:34.580
I value our family, Norma.

01:17:34.615 --> 01:17:36.548
You know that.

01:18:00.296 --> 01:18:01.780
Where is she this time?

01:18:01.815 --> 01:18:03.748
No, she's fine.

01:18:03.782 --> 01:18:06.751
I think she's fine.
She's in Philadelphia.

01:18:06.785 --> 01:18:10.478
Only I was in
the neighborhood.

01:18:21.179 --> 01:18:23.112
Can I get you anything?

01:18:23.146 --> 01:18:25.666
I don't think so.
No, thank you.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:31.707
So what can I do for you?

01:18:31.741 --> 01:18:33.674
Well...

01:18:39.818 --> 01:18:42.269
I hope you won't regret this.

01:18:42.303 --> 01:18:44.443
I cannot think of anything

01:18:44.478 --> 01:18:47.308
in my entire life
I would regret less

01:18:47.343 --> 01:18:49.379
than what we are
about to do.

01:18:52.175 --> 01:18:54.108
You honor me.

01:18:56.524 --> 01:18:59.079
You are too good for me.
I'm not too good for you.

01:18:59.113 --> 01:19:01.978
I'm not even sure I'm
good enough...

01:19:04.118 --> 01:19:05.292
but kiss me.

01:19:18.167 --> 01:19:22.136
Alan's not
a bad person. He's kind.

01:19:22.171 --> 01:19:25.139
But he's not
a husband to you.

01:19:25.174 --> 01:19:28.142
I had a cousin
like that in Germany.

01:19:28.177 --> 01:19:32.491
He was a good man, but one day 
he was beaten half to death.

01:19:32.526 --> 01:19:35.494
Your Alan is right
to keep his secret.

01:19:35.529 --> 01:19:37.531
I'm afraid so.

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:40.223
So how long will you
stay with him?

01:19:40.258 --> 01:19:42.778
Oh, I don't want a divorce.

01:19:42.812 --> 01:19:44.400
Why not?

01:19:44.434 --> 01:19:47.437
I did at first, but not now.
How would I explain it?

01:19:47.472 --> 01:19:49.612
What would I say
to the boys?

01:19:49.646 --> 01:19:51.614
They are not boys anymore.

01:19:51.648 --> 01:19:53.616
They're men.

01:19:53.650 --> 01:19:55.618
Tell them you want
to be happy.

01:19:55.652 --> 01:19:57.654
That's not enough.

01:19:57.689 --> 01:20:00.278
No?
No.

01:20:00.312 --> 01:20:03.005
More than anything,
I want them to be happy.

01:20:03.039 --> 01:20:04.834
They are happy.

01:20:04.869 --> 01:20:07.043
Don't want
to spoil that.

01:20:07.078 --> 01:20:08.942
What a waste.

01:20:11.841 --> 01:20:14.499
These marks are
from what you wear?

01:20:14.533 --> 01:20:16.535
From my corset, yes.

01:20:16.570 --> 01:20:18.537
Why wear it?

01:20:18.572 --> 01:20:20.539
Must be so tight.

01:20:20.574 --> 01:20:22.231
You get used to it.

01:20:22.265 --> 01:20:24.198
But why get used
to it?

01:20:47.704 --> 01:20:50.673
So... was it
worth it?

01:20:50.707 --> 01:20:53.193
It was fun, but it's
great to be home.

01:20:53.227 --> 01:20:56.817
I mean, Philadelphia's fine, and god 
knows it's an improvement on Wichita,

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:59.820
but I just wanted
to be in New York.

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:01.822
Isn't that something,
to be so attached

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.513
to a place that's
still so new to me?

01:21:03.548 --> 01:21:05.515
Maybe it's the right
place for you.

01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:07.172
There's no maybe
about it.

01:21:07.207 --> 01:21:09.174
When do you hear
about the troupe?

01:21:09.209 --> 01:21:11.176
I got it.
They've offered it.

01:21:11.211 --> 01:21:13.213
When were you going
to tell me?

01:21:14.766 --> 01:21:16.733
I'm so glad.

01:21:16.768 --> 01:21:18.701
I was afraid you'd
be disappointed.

01:21:18.735 --> 01:21:21.186
Miss Ruth didn't
seem too convinced.

01:21:21.221 --> 01:21:24.224
No, but Papa Shawn was,
and I knew he'd get his way.

01:21:24.258 --> 01:21:26.260
I'm not so sure.

01:21:26.295 --> 01:21:27.813
My guess is that when
the chips are down,

01:21:27.848 --> 01:21:30.506
Miss Ruth St. Denis
runs that company.

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.508
She can't refuse him
anything.

01:21:32.542 --> 01:21:35.235
To quote Miss Ruth,
we'll see.

01:21:35.269 --> 01:21:36.753
What's happened?

01:21:36.788 --> 01:21:38.272
What do you mean?

01:21:38.307 --> 01:21:41.310
I don't know, exactly.
You just seem different,

01:21:41.344 --> 01:21:43.312
as if something's
changed.

01:21:43.346 --> 01:21:45.279
When do you move in?

01:21:45.314 --> 01:21:47.764
They'll have a room
for me on friday.

01:21:47.799 --> 01:21:49.421
That soon?

01:21:49.456 --> 01:21:51.423
Why wait when it's
decided?

01:21:54.288 --> 01:21:56.808
Go and make
your peace with him.

01:21:56.842 --> 01:21:58.810
I suppose he hates me.

01:21:58.844 --> 01:22:01.813
No, he doesn't,
and I think

01:22:01.847 --> 01:22:04.505
he deserves
a proper apology.

01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:06.473
Alone?

01:22:06.507 --> 01:22:10.511
Alone... but come straight 
back to the apartment.

01:22:26.527 --> 01:22:29.496
We really ought to cable 
your mother tonight.

01:22:31.291 --> 01:22:34.087
You should never have shown 
me where your flat is.

01:22:34.121 --> 01:22:36.296
Come in, come in.

01:22:43.061 --> 01:22:45.305
I left the home.

01:22:45.339 --> 01:22:47.307
We were seen.

01:22:47.341 --> 01:22:49.481
I needed
to tell you.

01:22:49.516 --> 01:22:52.174
I was worried you
would go back there.

01:22:52.208 --> 01:22:53.692
What will you do?

01:22:53.727 --> 01:22:56.695
It's all right.
I have a friend in Brooklyn.

01:22:56.730 --> 01:23:00.389
He's at work now,
but we can go to his place later.

01:23:02.529 --> 01:23:05.118
Come on, Greta.
Say hi.

01:23:06.567 --> 01:23:08.190
Hello, Greta.

01:23:08.224 --> 01:23:10.226
She's not usually so shy.

01:23:10.261 --> 01:23:12.746
What can I get you?

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:16.301
We got toast and jam.
Do you like strawberry jam?

01:23:16.336 --> 01:23:19.477
And oranges? You'll like it.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:24.447
Good.

01:23:29.452 --> 01:23:31.420
There you go.

01:23:31.454 --> 01:23:33.387
Thank you.

01:23:36.218 --> 01:23:38.185
She'll eat
it all, in case

01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.738
you come
to take it away.

01:23:39.773 --> 01:23:42.707
Oh, god, I remember
that feeling.

01:23:45.123 --> 01:23:47.401
Who told?

01:23:47.436 --> 01:23:51.440
Sister Delores saw us walking 
out of the gate this morning.

01:23:51.474 --> 01:23:54.236
She fired me as soon
as I got back.

01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:56.272
But Greta hadn't
done anything.

01:23:56.307 --> 01:23:58.274
They offered
to keep her,

01:23:58.309 --> 01:24:00.069
but I said no.

01:24:00.104 --> 01:24:02.554
You were right,
or she'd have been on that train.

01:24:02.589 --> 01:24:06.144
How long can you stay with this 
friend in Brooklyn? What will you do?

01:24:07.387 --> 01:24:09.320
I'll find something.

01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:12.668
I've ruined your life.

01:24:12.702 --> 01:24:15.705
I pushed into your life
and I ruined it.

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:17.673
What are you talking about?

01:24:17.707 --> 01:24:20.676
Norma, you've given me
my only memory

01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:23.265
worth keeping
since before the war.

01:24:24.645 --> 01:24:27.269
If I found something
for you to do,

01:24:27.303 --> 01:24:29.271
a place where you could live,

01:24:29.305 --> 01:24:31.273
would you let me help you?

01:24:35.346 --> 01:24:37.831
I have a young daughter.

01:24:37.865 --> 01:24:40.523
I need all the help I can get.

01:24:44.562 --> 01:24:46.115
Louise.

01:24:47.565 --> 01:24:50.223
Who's the little girl?

01:24:52.708 --> 01:24:55.020
You again.

01:24:55.055 --> 01:24:57.540
Where are you going to 
carry me off to this time?

01:24:57.575 --> 01:25:00.233
I don't think you met 
properly the other night.

01:25:00.267 --> 01:25:03.028
This is my brother Joseph.

01:25:03.063 --> 01:25:04.202
Your brother?

01:25:04.237 --> 01:25:06.204
Joseph Schmidt, Louise Brooks.

01:25:06.239 --> 01:25:08.413
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:25:08.448 --> 01:25:11.071
And Greta is my niece.

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:13.556
Yes, she would be.

01:25:13.591 --> 01:25:15.558
That's how it works.

01:25:15.593 --> 01:25:17.526
We should be going.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:20.563
My friend is going to be home 
by the time we get there.

01:25:20.598 --> 01:25:24.291
Fine. We'll meet on Saturday.

01:25:24.326 --> 01:25:26.259
Ahem.

01:25:28.157 --> 01:25:30.642
At grand central station

01:25:30.677 --> 01:25:33.266
at the ticket office
at 10:00.

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:35.130
Grand central on Saturday.

01:25:35.164 --> 01:25:36.407
At 10:00.

01:25:38.512 --> 01:25:42.654
And you better bring
everything with you.

01:25:42.689 --> 01:25:44.691
We don't know how
long you're going

01:25:44.725 --> 01:25:47.763
to be staying
in Wichita.

01:25:50.317 --> 01:25:52.285
No, I guess we don't.

01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:59.188
Well, bye,
Mr. Brother.

01:25:59.223 --> 01:26:01.777
I don't think we'll meet again.
Not in Kansas?

01:26:01.811 --> 01:26:04.366
Least of all in Kansas.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.437
Then good-bye, Miss Brooks.

01:26:14.238 --> 01:26:17.724
Well, you kept that
pretty quiet.

01:26:17.758 --> 01:26:21.797
This brother all tied up with that letter
you were expecting from Haverhill?

01:26:21.831 --> 01:26:23.799
Exactly.

01:26:28.424 --> 01:26:30.081
Do tell.

01:26:30.115 --> 01:26:32.048
I'd written to a friend
of my mother's.

01:26:32.083 --> 01:26:34.396
I came across a letter from her,
so I wrote to her.

01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:36.087
And?

01:26:36.121 --> 01:26:38.572
And we met,
and she told me

01:26:38.607 --> 01:26:41.334
how my mother died
when I was born.

01:26:41.368 --> 01:26:44.475
It seems my father went 
home to Germany with Joseph,

01:26:44.509 --> 01:26:48.133
but I was still a baby, so I was left 
with a cousin in New York, then she died,

01:26:48.168 --> 01:26:51.413
and that's how I wound up
in the orphanage.

01:26:51.447 --> 01:26:53.415
Why didn't the friend
prevent that,

01:26:53.449 --> 01:26:56.349
or at least write
to your father?

01:26:59.593 --> 01:27:02.562
She had children of her own,
and she lost contact with him.

01:27:03.839 --> 01:27:05.806
Then Joseph reappeared?

01:27:07.187 --> 01:27:09.672
He contacted her
a while ago

01:27:09.707 --> 01:27:12.330
when he returned
to america.

01:27:12.365 --> 01:27:15.299
He was trying to trace me,
so naturally,

01:27:15.333 --> 01:27:18.060
they were pleased
when I wrote.

01:27:18.094 --> 01:27:19.544
Wow.

01:27:19.579 --> 01:27:22.237
That's quite a story.

01:27:22.271 --> 01:27:25.481
Hmm. Oh,
and by the way,

01:27:25.516 --> 01:27:28.484
it's "hay-vur-ill,"
not "have-ur-hill."

01:27:28.519 --> 01:27:31.211
You don't pronounce
the second "h."

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:33.144
Well,
what do you know?

01:27:49.229 --> 01:27:52.715
Wow. Thought you were
moving differently.

01:27:54.786 --> 01:27:58.445
It's too hot. It's hard to wear 
anything tight in the hot weather.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.483
Well, I'm glad our trip
has produced results.

01:28:09.663 --> 01:28:13.322
I don't envy you going back 
to that town, god knows...

01:28:13.357 --> 01:28:16.670
but I hope things work out 
for you, Norma. I mean that.

01:28:18.431 --> 01:28:20.364
Me, too.

01:28:20.398 --> 01:28:24.333
I hope you get everything you 
want, Louise. You deserve it.

01:28:31.375 --> 01:28:33.342
By the way...

01:28:33.377 --> 01:28:37.312
you should have said he was 
your brother in the speakeasy.

01:28:37.346 --> 01:28:40.522
Always say it straightaway 
before anyone can ask a question.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.289
Horse feathers.

01:29:14.210 --> 01:29:16.178
Papa?

01:29:17.731 --> 01:29:20.355
Where are we going?

01:29:23.427 --> 01:29:27.085
We're going to
my home in Kansas,

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:30.226
which I hope will be
your home, too.

01:29:30.261 --> 01:29:32.401
And you'll meet
your uncle Alan

01:29:32.436 --> 01:29:35.577
and your cousins,
Hioward and Earl.

01:29:42.446 --> 01:29:45.656
When will you tell him
the truth...

01:29:45.690 --> 01:29:47.796
about us?

01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:51.075
As soon as we're
alone, I guess.

01:29:51.109 --> 01:29:53.560
What about the boys?

01:29:55.286 --> 01:29:57.737
I won't tell the boys,

01:29:57.771 --> 01:30:00.429
and you won't
tell Greta, ever.

01:30:04.778 --> 01:30:06.746
It feels so dishonest.

01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:09.438
Of course it's dishonest.

01:30:09.473 --> 01:30:13.442
In a better world, we would shout 
who we are from the rooftops,

01:30:13.477 --> 01:30:16.307
but I can't wait for
a better world, Joseph.

01:30:16.341 --> 01:30:19.344
I'm living now,
and I want to be happy.

01:30:20.553 --> 01:30:22.693
And if it doesn't work?

01:30:25.558 --> 01:30:28.526
If it doesn't work...

01:30:29.872 --> 01:30:32.530
my dear brother will
find a job elsewhere

01:30:32.565 --> 01:30:36.534
and leave town and take
his daughter with him.

01:30:36.569 --> 01:30:39.537
But I think it
will work...

01:30:39.572 --> 01:30:42.540
'cause I think we
want it to work.

01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:49.444
Suppose they repeal
prohibition.

01:30:50.824 --> 01:30:53.309
Can I have a beer?

01:30:55.346 --> 01:30:57.590
All righty.
Have a beer.

01:31:13.502 --> 01:31:15.470
He says not
to worry about him.

01:31:15.504 --> 01:31:18.162
At least his unit is 
nowhere near the front.

01:31:18.196 --> 01:31:20.647
What else does he say?

01:31:20.682 --> 01:31:23.788
What can he say?
He's well. That's about it.

01:31:23.823 --> 01:31:26.342
That won't tell us anything.
The censor inks it out.

01:31:26.377 --> 01:31:29.035
Read it for yourself.
Let Greta see it.

01:31:29.069 --> 01:31:31.762
Think he is well?
Think he'll come home safe?

01:31:31.796 --> 01:31:33.729
I hope he will.

01:31:33.764 --> 01:31:37.319
Why'd he have to go when 
his brother's already fighting?

01:31:37.353 --> 01:31:39.148
I don't understand it.
He's a doctor.

01:31:39.183 --> 01:31:40.771
They should be
protected.

01:31:40.805 --> 01:31:42.600
I don't think he
wanted to be protected.

01:31:42.635 --> 01:31:45.120
Maybe not, but he has a wife 
and children to think about.

01:31:45.154 --> 01:31:48.503
Lots of them have wives.
Lots of them have children.

01:31:49.883 --> 01:31:52.437
I guess.
Look, mommy.

01:31:52.472 --> 01:31:54.094
He'll be all right,
you know.

01:31:54.129 --> 01:31:55.786
I don't know,
and nor do you.

01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:57.788
Tell her, papa.
She'll believe you.

01:31:57.822 --> 01:32:00.445
Well, I can't say what
is going to happen,

01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:03.794
but both of your sons
are very fine men.

01:32:03.828 --> 01:32:05.416
You should be
proud of them.

01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:07.142
That's for sure.by the way,

01:32:07.176 --> 01:32:09.144
I heard something
this morning

01:32:09.178 --> 01:32:11.146
about your old pal.

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.699
I meant to
tell you earlier.

01:32:12.734 --> 01:32:14.563
Which old pal?

01:32:14.598 --> 01:32:17.255
Louise Brooks.
She's back in Wichita.

01:32:17.290 --> 01:32:19.257
I ran into her mother
on my way here.

01:32:19.292 --> 01:32:20.465
What?

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.157
When did she get here, Raymond?

01:32:22.191 --> 01:32:24.090
A while ago, apparently.

01:32:24.124 --> 01:32:26.402
Why haven't I heard about this?
Maybe because

01:32:26.437 --> 01:32:28.094
you had enough
on your plate,

01:32:28.128 --> 01:32:30.061
looking after all of us.

01:32:33.133 --> 01:32:34.583
Ray, what time are you 
coming for me tomorrow?

01:32:34.618 --> 01:32:36.274
I'll pick you up around 3:00.

01:32:36.309 --> 01:32:37.828
Aren't you staying for dinner tonight?

01:32:37.862 --> 01:32:39.519
I will if you'll have me.

01:32:41.348 --> 01:32:43.350
I've only just been 
told she's back in town.

01:32:43.385 --> 01:32:45.352
I'd have come earlier
if I'd known.

01:32:45.387 --> 01:32:47.251
She's been here
for 6 months.

01:32:47.285 --> 01:32:50.288
Wichita's a bigger town
than it used to be.

01:32:50.323 --> 01:32:52.774
Yes, Wichita is bigger,

01:32:52.808 --> 01:32:55.500
and Louise Brooks is smaller.

01:32:55.535 --> 01:32:58.193
Did you hear about how Ruth St.
Denis got rid of her

01:32:58.227 --> 01:32:59.677
as soon as she could?

01:32:59.712 --> 01:33:01.679
Paramount did the same.

01:33:01.714 --> 01:33:04.095
Everything she touches flops.

01:33:05.683 --> 01:33:07.616
She's up there.

01:33:07.651 --> 01:33:10.481
You'll have to knock, but I doubt 
you'll get much out of her.

01:33:10.515 --> 01:33:12.448
Thank you.

01:33:35.161 --> 01:33:37.646
Louise, are you
in there?

01:33:37.681 --> 01:33:40.338
Can you open
the door?

01:33:40.373 --> 01:33:43.341
It's Norma Carlisle.

01:33:47.311 --> 01:33:49.796
I know you never did anything 
I said 20 years ago,

01:33:49.831 --> 01:33:52.247
but I wish you'd
open the door.

01:33:56.113 --> 01:33:58.046
What do you want?

01:33:59.426 --> 01:34:01.359
I want to see you.

01:34:01.394 --> 01:34:04.811
I only just heard you were here.
I didn't know it before today.

01:34:07.262 --> 01:34:09.195
How's your German,
Norma?

01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:12.750
You mean my brother?
Oh, he's done so well.

01:34:12.785 --> 01:34:14.752
No, German.

01:34:14.787 --> 01:34:16.720
The language.

01:34:16.754 --> 01:34:20.413
I wondered if you're familiar 
with the term "schadenfreude,"

01:34:20.447 --> 01:34:22.415
pleasure in the misery
of others?

01:34:22.449 --> 01:34:24.589
We don't have
an equivalent,

01:34:24.624 --> 01:34:27.592
but it's a useful word,
especially in Wichita.

01:34:27.627 --> 01:34:29.594
I have not come here
to gloat.

01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:31.804
You know me better
than that.

01:34:31.838 --> 01:34:34.289
Do I?

01:34:38.189 --> 01:34:41.020
Maybe I do.

01:34:46.232 --> 01:34:48.165
Saw your mother
downstairs.

01:34:48.199 --> 01:34:50.719
She has such a wonderful 
collection of your posters.

01:34:50.754 --> 01:34:52.721
Oh, yes.

01:34:52.756 --> 01:34:55.690
Mother was a big fan of Louise Brooks,
the movie star.

01:34:55.724 --> 01:34:58.727
She's less of a fan of Louise Brooks,
not the movie star.

01:34:58.762 --> 01:35:00.729
You were so magical.

01:35:00.764 --> 01:35:02.731
I was very proud
to have known you.

01:35:02.766 --> 01:35:05.044
Loved it when
your movies came here.

01:35:05.078 --> 01:35:06.839
Most of them were terrible.

01:35:06.873 --> 01:35:09.531
Oh, no, I loved them.

01:35:09.565 --> 01:35:13.224
"American Venus,"
"Social Celebrity,"

01:35:13.259 --> 01:35:16.227
"A Girl in Every Port"--so many.

01:35:16.262 --> 01:35:18.195
As for the German films,

01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:20.749
"Pandora's Box"
haunted me for weeks.

01:35:20.784 --> 01:35:22.682
Did it?

01:35:22.717 --> 01:35:25.133
Don't make them nothing.

01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:29.516
Don't you remember,
every shop girl,

01:35:29.551 --> 01:35:31.795
every office worker,
they all copied you.

01:35:31.829 --> 01:35:34.314
They copied your look.
They copied your hair.

01:35:34.349 --> 01:35:36.523
Do you know why?

01:35:36.558 --> 01:35:39.595
You made them feel free.

01:35:40.873 --> 01:35:44.669
You changed things,
Louise. You did.

01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:48.673
If you say so.

01:35:48.708 --> 01:35:51.676
Why'd you stop
making films?

01:35:51.711 --> 01:35:54.334
I stopped making films 
because I hated hollywood,

01:35:54.369 --> 01:35:57.199
and hollywood hated me.
That's all.

01:35:59.581 --> 01:36:02.204
Why are you here?
Why have you come back?

01:36:02.239 --> 01:36:06.174
Because I've reached
the end of the road.

01:36:06.208 --> 01:36:08.107
I knew it.

01:36:08.141 --> 01:36:10.488
I knew it the moment I heard 
you were back in Wichita.

01:36:10.523 --> 01:36:13.526
I knew you'd given up.
That's why I've come.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.424
Norma, look at me.

01:36:15.459 --> 01:36:17.426
I'm 35 years old.

01:36:17.461 --> 01:36:20.119
I'm broke. I have
nowhere else to go.

01:36:20.153 --> 01:36:21.845
Horse feathers!

01:36:21.879 --> 01:36:25.538
"Horse feathers."

01:36:25.572 --> 01:36:27.747
Whatever you want to call it,
that's ridiculous.

01:36:27.782 --> 01:36:29.749
You don't like your parents,
and why should you?

01:36:29.784 --> 01:36:32.476
You don't like this house.
You don't like this town. Why come back?

01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:37.170
Are you a homing pigeon for misery?
Just get on a train and go.

01:36:38.482 --> 01:36:40.277
I'm too old.

01:36:40.311 --> 01:36:42.072
I am.

01:36:42.106 --> 01:36:46.041
I am all used up, Norma.
I'm not even me anymore.

01:36:47.353 --> 01:36:49.286
Louise.

01:36:50.874 --> 01:36:53.842
You taught me
something once.

01:36:53.877 --> 01:36:56.500
I taught you?

01:36:56.534 --> 01:36:59.296
I just remember getting 
drunk and throwing up.

01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:01.816
Well, that was part
of it...

01:37:01.850 --> 01:37:05.820
but I know you, Louise,
or I knew you then,

01:37:05.854 --> 01:37:10.203
and I am certain you
are not used up.

01:37:10.238 --> 01:37:13.275
I am certain there's still
quite a bit of you left.

01:37:14.863 --> 01:37:18.487
Now, I'm going
to give you...

01:37:18.522 --> 01:37:20.489
a hundred dollars.

01:37:20.524 --> 01:37:23.320
No, no, you don't
owe me anything.

01:37:23.354 --> 01:37:25.391
Please--
you're wrong.

01:37:27.082 --> 01:37:30.085
I owe you a lot more
than a hundred dollars.

01:37:33.364 --> 01:37:35.850
Pack your bags today.

01:37:35.884 --> 01:37:37.852
Go down to
the train station

01:37:37.886 --> 01:37:40.544
and buy a ticket
for New York.

01:37:46.446 --> 01:37:48.414
Norma?

01:37:51.348 --> 01:37:53.868
When you took off 
your corset that day,

01:37:53.902 --> 01:37:56.560
did you ever
put it on again?

01:37:57.906 --> 01:38:00.529
No, I never did.

01:38:00.564 --> 01:38:03.256
Good-bye, Louise.

01:38:03.291 --> 01:38:05.258
Good luck.

01:38:05.293 --> 01:38:07.502
Don't come back.

01:38:19.307 --> 01:38:21.274
How was it?

01:38:21.309 --> 01:38:23.242
All right, I think.

01:38:23.276 --> 01:38:25.244
You're not sorry you went?

01:38:25.278 --> 01:38:27.453
Absolutely not,
but you know Louise.

01:38:27.487 --> 01:38:30.111
She has to do it
her own way.

01:38:30.145 --> 01:38:32.078
Let's go home.

01:38:37.463 --> 01:38:40.086
Was Greta right?

01:38:40.121 --> 01:38:42.675
Do you think you had
too much on your plate,

01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:44.711
looking after us all?

01:38:44.746 --> 01:38:46.368
No.

01:38:46.403 --> 01:38:48.888
I had enough on my plate,

01:38:48.923 --> 01:38:51.580
but not too much.

01:38:53.272 --> 01:38:55.791
Do we need anything for dinner?

01:38:55.826 --> 01:38:57.793
I don't think so.

01:38:57.828 --> 01:39:00.279
Oh, maybe we should
pick up some butter

01:39:00.313 --> 01:39:03.282
if Mr. Taylor is still open.
