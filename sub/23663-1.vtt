02:06.040 --> 02:08.429
- What the fuck, man?
- Good morning, asshole.

02:08.520 --> 02:12.195
Not another word.
Hands above the blanket.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.554
Get the fuck up. Hands down.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.313
You sit right there! And shut up!

02:37.080 --> 02:39.594
Police officer! Freeze!

02:41.080 --> 02:42.274
Shit!

02:44.480 --> 02:46.596
You OK?

02:53.200 --> 02:56.749
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.831
He's dead.

03:06.120 --> 03:11.558
I mean, he made a move, right?
I thought he was going for something.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.074
There's no weapon, man.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.116
Oh, man!

03:29.760 --> 03:34.550
Hold it, Dennis. What are you doing,
man? What are you doing?

03:34.640 --> 03:38.952
Hey, Dennis,
what are you doing, man?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.434
It's up to you.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.028
It's happened to all of us, man.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.395
You're not alone.

03:59.360 --> 04:03.512
Internal Affairs is the most
important division on the force.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.990
We're the cops' cops.
We set the tone.

04:07.080 --> 04:12.108
Therefore, every IAD officer must
avoid even the appearance of evil.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.668
If cops are better than other people,

04:14.760 --> 04:17.637
we have to be better than other cops.

04:19.519 --> 04:22.034
Now, Los Angeles consistently has

04:22.120 --> 04:24.588
the cleanest force in the country.

04:24.680 --> 04:28.150
That's because of us.
Contrary to popular opinion,

04:28.240 --> 04:32.153
the officers in the field
don't resent us.

04:32.240 --> 04:37.439
Because we keep the force clean,
they have respect on the street.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.274
Well...

04:43.360 --> 04:46.636
let's get you started.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.313
Yes, ma'am. Was it a two-unit car?

04:52.400 --> 04:56.837
Listen up.
I want you to meet Raymond Avilla.

04:56.920 --> 05:00.196
He'll be joining us as of today.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.235
Detective Peters.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.117
Did you get his name?

05:03.200 --> 05:06.112
This is Smith, on the phone.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.755
Detective Davies.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.070
Nice to meet you.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.798
And Sergeant Wallace,

05:13.880 --> 05:17.111
who'll be your partner
and training officer.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.156
Sergeant Wallace?

05:19.240 --> 05:23.870
- Hi, Raymond Avilla.
- Amy Wallace, nice to meet you.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.076
We're fine.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.513
Good.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.830
- Can I get you a coffee?
- No, I'm fine.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.195
You wanna run and get me one?

05:39.280 --> 05:41.748
I'm just kidding. That's your desk.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.357
You wanna get started?
I got somebody waiting down the hall.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.395
OK.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.914
It's this guy.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.468
He was picked up in the Valley.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.757
He admits having some cocaine on him.

05:56.840 --> 06:02.119
He says the arresting officer
planted a bag in his car

06:02.200 --> 06:04.714
and beat up on him
and his girlfriend.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.032
- Van Stretch.
- Yeah. You know him?

06:13.200 --> 06:15.919
>From the Academy.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.310
Do you want to pass it on
to another team?

06:21.880 --> 06:23.074
No.

06:23.160 --> 06:26.516
So, let's go.
It's right down the hall.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.558
No, we'll drive out to the Valley.

06:29.640 --> 06:33.838
Hey, Ramon! You old horse-thief!

06:33.920 --> 06:35.512
Good to see you!

06:35.600 --> 06:40.799
- And you! My old beat sergeant.
- I heard you made it to IAD.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.350
- How's your wife?
- Still busting my chops.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.874
Some things never change. Wallace.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.838
This man is sharp.
He'll keep you dancing.

06:49.920 --> 06:54.675
We report to Lieutenant Grieb
on the rare occasions we find him in!

06:54.760 --> 06:58.753
Good to have you aboard.
Come and say hello.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.239
Wallace.

07:04.960 --> 07:09.033
OK, tell him to get here
as soon as he can!

07:14.280 --> 07:16.635
- Who you talking to?
- Nobody.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.553
- I said, who was that?
- It wasn't anybody.

07:34.200 --> 07:39.194
- Don't hit me, Van.
- Did you call your boyfriend?

07:39.280 --> 07:41.840
I don't have a boyfriend.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.275
Don't have a boyfriend?

07:45.360 --> 07:49.638
Then who the fuck
are you out with all the time?

07:52.840 --> 07:56.753
- Leave her alone!
- Get out, Sean!

08:06.440 --> 08:08.271
Let go!

08:10.160 --> 08:14.233
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on there, pal?

08:14.320 --> 08:18.154
What's going on?
You're having a lot of fun!

08:18.240 --> 08:21.277
Get him out of here, Dennis!

08:21.360 --> 08:26.354
Let's go for a walk. Look at this.
Look what's going on out here.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.829
Get some air. I'll be right out.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.679
- Are you all right?
- I've had it with him, Dennis.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.030
Man, she's on somebody else's root!

08:49.680 --> 08:52.558
I smell it on her, Dennis!

09:29.600 --> 09:32.751
I didn't know
it was gonna be like this!

09:34.200 --> 09:38.398
That's the way it is.
That's the way it is, isn't it?

09:39.440 --> 09:43.638
How many cops do you know
that have nothing?

09:45.360 --> 09:48.750
Divorced, alcoholic,
kids won't talk to them any more,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.230
can't get it up.

09:51.320 --> 09:55.677
They sit in their little apartments,
alone, in the dark,

09:55.760 --> 09:58.513
playing lollipop
with a service revolver.

10:06.800 --> 10:11.316
You get yourself together.
Do you hear me?

10:11.400 --> 10:16.633
You get yourself together
or you're on your own.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.794
When was the last time
you saw Van Stretch?

10:25.880 --> 10:27.518
Couple of years ago.

10:27.600 --> 10:33.232
Hey, could you get somebody to sub
for me at the Galleria on Sunday?

10:33.320 --> 10:36.995
I gotta study
for the sergeant's exams.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.150
No problem. Hey, Fred?

10:39.240 --> 10:42.312
I need you to work Galleria Sunday.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.039
Shit. I can't, I got Raiders tickets.

10:45.120 --> 10:48.078
Trafficante,
you see your kid on Sundays?

10:48.160 --> 10:50.276
- Yeah.
- Give them to him.

10:54.080 --> 10:58.870
What Oates said about your
fellow officers respecting you is,

10:58.960 --> 11:01.315
as you know, complete crap.

11:01.400 --> 11:06.428
Most cops hate our guts,
if they credit us with having any!

11:06.520 --> 11:11.594
They think we went into IAD
for the promotions, which is true.

11:11.680 --> 11:14.069
They're polite
cos they're afraid of us.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.551
- Judson, you got messages for me?
- Yeah. You got 18!

11:18.640 --> 11:23.236
I got better things to do
than be your answering service!

11:23.320 --> 11:27.313
Yeah, it must get tense
behind that desk!

11:27.400 --> 11:30.995
Everything's a joke
with you guys, right?

11:39.520 --> 11:41.590
Raymond!

11:41.680 --> 11:44.114
I'll be inside.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.156
Holy shit!

11:46.240 --> 11:48.800
Hey, Raymond Avilla

11:48.880 --> 11:51.075
Dennis Peck, my partner.

11:53.720 --> 11:57.190
- Hillerman case.
- Right. At the Academy.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.556
- Very impressive.
- I got lucky.

12:02.760 --> 12:06.833
- Hey, it's great to see you.
- Good to see you, Van.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.599
What the hell are you doing here?

12:11.680 --> 12:13.671
He's IAD.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.549
He came to see you, man.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.749
I'm gonna talk to you soon, OK?

12:36.080 --> 12:37.718
It's OK.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.315
He says you forced him
to empty his pockets.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.153
I asked him to and he wouldn't.

12:44.240 --> 12:48.153
- He said, "Keep your hands off."
- Why were they on him?

12:48.240 --> 12:50.231
They weren't.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.997
Look, he wouldn't empty his pockets!

12:55.080 --> 12:57.674
What prompted you to search him?

12:57.760 --> 12:59.910
He's a fucking junkie!

13:00.000 --> 13:03.390
It's obvious.
He's jumpy, fidgety, talking fast.

13:04.560 --> 13:07.074
Why did you hit him, Van?

13:07.160 --> 13:09.435
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.996
OK, I did.
They made a move for my gun!

13:14.080 --> 13:16.833
They both made a move for your gun?

13:18.200 --> 13:20.111
They say you provoked.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.510
Come on,
you know that's nigger bullshit!

13:26.560 --> 13:27.709
Sorry.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.598
You've had three 181s
for excessive force.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.433
You're wearing a hole in the carpet!

13:33.520 --> 13:35.909
I just stand up to assholes.

13:38.720 --> 13:42.474
We tested the stuff in his pocket
against what you found in the car.

13:42.560 --> 13:47.554
So? What does that mean? He had
two stashes - to use and to sell.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.310
I mean, if they were different.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.198
Off the record?

14:05.960 --> 14:09.919
If you need counselling, Van,
the Department will provide it.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.913
If you have a dependency,
you can deal with it on suspension.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.752
But if you're caught using...

14:15.840 --> 14:19.230
- I don't have a problem!
- Did you hear what I said?

14:19.320 --> 14:23.518
What are you talking about?
Like I said, I don't have a problem.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.349
You look like shit, man.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.112
How's Penny, Van?

14:39.320 --> 14:41.311
She's great.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.555
- Are we finished here?
- Almost.

14:45.640 --> 14:49.599
We'll see you at IAD.
You may bring an attorney.

15:03.120 --> 15:06.078
All those friends
you have on the force?

15:07.120 --> 15:09.156
You don't have 'em any more.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.754
May I have your attention
for a minute?

15:13.840 --> 15:17.879
I'd like to welcome you
to the New Contemporary Museum.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.838
Andrea Dietrich's work is on view.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.354
Hers is the first installation

15:23.440 --> 15:27.399
in a series
of new contemporary video artists.

15:27.480 --> 15:32.918
This was made possible by a generous
donation by Nicholas Hollander.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.029
This is Carlos.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.190
An erotic artist.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.028
Hi! How are you?

15:59.880 --> 16:01.791
Excuse me, do I know you?

16:01.880 --> 16:04.792
- You're the girl in the video.
- No, I'm not.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.713
- Sorry.
- Nice tie. Your wife buy it?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.189
Yes. Nice dress. Where's the rest?

16:10.280 --> 16:12.919
- You're late.
- Let's get out of here.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.594
We've got two more hours. Be good.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.717
Hey, tiger! How you doing?

16:20.280 --> 16:21.599
Good.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.835
How did it go?

16:31.920 --> 16:33.717
OK.

16:35.240 --> 16:39.233
I got a couple more questions
to answer at IAD next week.

16:39.320 --> 16:40.469
Yeah?

16:45.200 --> 16:47.270
How was your buddy Raymond?

16:51.240 --> 16:54.312
OK. I think they bought it.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.476
It's my word against Superfly, right?

17:04.800 --> 17:09.954
I talked to Heather. She said
the guest room's OK, no problem.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.396
Thanks.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.875
Did you have a good day?

17:24.359 --> 17:28.911
I have a racist boss,
a small desk and a new partner.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.394
Do you like him? Your new partner?

17:34.520 --> 17:37.159
It's a she.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.910
Is she pretty?

17:48.520 --> 17:52.115
She's pretty smart and a good cop.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.714
Let's go to bed.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.959
Did you have to kiss every single
person at the party tonight?

18:10.760 --> 18:12.751
It's my job.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.355
It's my job.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.280
Hey, Heather's trying to sleep.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.954
Heather is not asleep!

18:41.120 --> 18:42.951
How's my boy?

18:43.040 --> 18:47.591
Your little girl is wonderful.
She's terrific.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.471
Did you get your messages?

18:52.560 --> 18:53.549
- No.
- No?

18:53.640 --> 18:59.272
Miriam called. And Kate called twice.
I think she needs a loan.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.515
And a Steven Arrocas...

19:02.600 --> 19:06.991
Steven Arrocas called
to confirm his meeting with you.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.958
And Jay called just to say hi.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.474
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.154
Hi, sugarpuss!

19:16.240 --> 19:18.595
Hi, sweetheart.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.119
- So?
- So?

19:21.200 --> 19:24.556
So, how was your date, Lolly?

19:24.640 --> 19:27.598
Date? My ex-wife has a date?

19:29.040 --> 19:31.235
- With who?
- I'm not telling you.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.276
- I'll find out.
- No, you won't.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.315
I will.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.676
Hi, Raymond.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.355
- Hi, Penny.
- How are you?

19:44.440 --> 19:49.036
Good. You look great.
This is my partner, Amy Wallace.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.588
- Sean looks terrific.
- He's great.

19:51.680 --> 19:52.999
Big.

19:53.080 --> 19:58.712
Sorry I'm late. And I have another
meeting in two minutes, so...

19:58.800 --> 20:03.476
- This won't take long.
- That looks pretty painful.

20:03.560 --> 20:07.189
What? Oh, this? Yeah.

20:11.120 --> 20:17.116
Van can be a real jerk sometimes
when he's drinking.

20:17.200 --> 20:20.112
- Is that often?
- No.

20:25.040 --> 20:28.032
You noticed any changes
in his behaviour at home?

20:28.120 --> 20:29.519
No.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.394
- Having financial problems?
- No.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.229
Is he under
an unusual amount of stress?

20:40.320 --> 20:42.470
- No, not really.
- No?

20:42.560 --> 20:43.709
No...no.

20:44.960 --> 20:48.589
- I see. Using drugs?
- No.

20:48.680 --> 20:52.116
To your knowledge he's not
using drugs at this time?

20:52.200 --> 20:53.155
No.

20:53.240 --> 20:57.631
Then what's his problem?
We can't help unless we know.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.790
You don't want to help.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.429
You want to nail him
so you can make Lieutenant!

21:11.960 --> 21:14.428
Are you having marital problems?

21:15.800 --> 21:18.598
I don't think that's your business.

21:18.680 --> 21:23.356
- Seeing anybody else, Penny?
- Who told you that? Van?

21:25.640 --> 21:31.158
Listen, I have a meeting,
so if there are no more questions...

21:31.240 --> 21:34.232
- Not from me.
- No. Thanks a lot.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.673
Yeah.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.189
Very intuitive.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.038
- Can I buy you lunch?
- Yeah.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.714
Look at that.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.590
That's a nice car.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.915
Plus she had the Rolex.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.636
How you doing?

23:33.760 --> 23:35.716
Sweetmeat, don't do this.

23:38.800 --> 23:43.920
Sorry, you can't do it, man.
Can't do it. You got to let her go.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.274
- What?
- She's my snitch.

23:45.360 --> 23:48.830
- I need her on the street.
- She made me an offer.

23:48.920 --> 23:51.957
Say it was entrapment,
you did it wrong. OK?

23:52.040 --> 23:54.076
But I did do it right.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.276
Say you didn't.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.038
Come here.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.680
Dennis, what are you doing, man?

24:03.760 --> 24:08.629
You said you needed money,
I got you a job, right?

24:08.720 --> 24:14.238
You needed time to study,
I got you that. Now I need something.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.993
- I can't do that, man.
- All right.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.716
Get out! Go!

24:27.080 --> 24:30.277
OK? You all right? OK?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.639
You still love me. I know you do.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.871
She was my snitch, man!
What can I do?

24:36.960 --> 24:41.715
We're fairly sure he beat up
on these people unprovoked.

24:41.800 --> 24:46.510
He has an obvious drug problem,
plus he was rude to me!

24:46.600 --> 24:48.989
Well, nail his ass!

24:49.080 --> 24:51.548
How long will it take?

24:51.640 --> 24:53.949
Two days.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.429
Why don't you give us three?

24:56.520 --> 24:58.476
All right, good.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.438
Coach?

25:02.480 --> 25:06.359
- You know Dennis Peck?
- Yeah, he's a great cop.

25:06.440 --> 25:12.072
- How come he's just a P2?
- Cos he doesn't care to be a P3.

25:12.160 --> 25:15.197
- He's likes the streets.
- He likes pussy!

25:15.280 --> 25:18.556
Why? Are you curious, Wallace?

25:18.640 --> 25:21.871
- I'm curious. Can you set it up?
- Sure.

25:46.560 --> 25:49.870
- How you doing?
- All right.

25:49.960 --> 25:55.239
Yeah. I got to go back out quick.
Want to ask me about Van?

25:55.320 --> 25:57.436
Actually, it's about Van's wife.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.512
- You know Penny?
- Of course I do.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.114
I think that's what the problem is.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.668
Yeah?

26:06.720 --> 26:09.109
I'm here off the record as a friend.

26:12.360 --> 26:16.353
Do you think
maybe Penny's sleeping around?

26:20.160 --> 26:25.234
You're married too, right? Just
as friends - you're married too?

26:25.320 --> 26:27.311
I'm married. He's married.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.789
- You're married?
- Yeah.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.348
Does your wife fuck around?

26:33.960 --> 26:36.633
It doesn't feel good, does it?

26:36.720 --> 26:41.032
Stay away from wives.
Don't talk about them.

26:43.280 --> 26:45.157
Do you?

26:46.760 --> 26:49.354
- Stay away from wives?
- That's right.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.631
I'll tell you about wives,

26:53.720 --> 26:57.793
my vast, eXtensive eXperience
with wives.

26:57.880 --> 27:02.510
They're all looking for strange,
just like you or me.

27:02.600 --> 27:06.718
My wife, his wife, your wife,
it's all the same.

27:06.800 --> 27:11.828
You're looking for strange.
You see a pretty girl, you look.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.957
Here. A very pretty girl, you look.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.590
Kee, come here a second.

27:20.920 --> 27:26.074
Kee, this is Raymond...Aviller?

27:26.160 --> 27:28.549
- Is that right?
- Close enough.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.029
- She's very pretty?
- She's beautiful.

27:31.120 --> 27:34.590
- Do you want her?
- Do I want her?

27:39.040 --> 27:41.474
In another life, I want her.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.269
- You won't get another.
- I'm not looking for another.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.669
- I'll tell you what.
- What?

27:47.760 --> 27:52.629
You want to ask me any more questions
about Van Stretch,

27:52.720 --> 27:55.359
do it officially at Internal Affairs.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.432
I don't need to ask
any more questions.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.919
Good.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.434
- I got all my answers.
- Thank you.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.600
You can do better, Kee.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.910
Very clever, Raymond.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.152
Van moonlights 15 hours a week
doing security at the Galleria,

28:16.240 --> 28:18.470
plus $38,000 from the department,

28:18.560 --> 28:22.872
plus her $25,000 from the bank.
$85,000 tops.

28:22.960 --> 28:27.954
Last March they bought a house
in Granada Hills for $402,000.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.350
They've spent 300 grand
in 18 months!

28:31.440 --> 28:34.273
What do you think he's doing?

28:35.400 --> 28:39.393
- It could be a lot of things.
- Think he's doing it alone?

28:42.160 --> 28:43.673
Not Van.

28:43.760 --> 28:47.196
Well, whatever he's doing,
the pay's good.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.590
I can't believe
he's running the show.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.955
Dennis could be.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.554
Which doesn't mean he is.

28:55.640 --> 29:00.589
- We could run a financial.
- We're not authorised.

29:17.360 --> 29:20.955
Ain't nothing
like the real thing, baby!

29:21.040 --> 29:25.830
I got another vice officer
needs work. He's a good man.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.992
- I can't use him.
- Can't use him?

29:29.080 --> 29:33.039
You know how much
shoplifters take this place for?

29:33.120 --> 29:35.236
Your cops are all boneheads.

29:35.320 --> 29:38.312
They're in the toilet,
doing flute recitals.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.516
Powdering their noses. Get it!

29:40.600 --> 29:44.388
- That's why you need more.
- More like Lurch?

29:44.480 --> 29:46.391
I don't think so.

29:49.880 --> 29:53.111
You talk to the Arrocases yet?

29:53.200 --> 29:57.478
It'd be nice
if you could help them out, Dennis.

30:00.200 --> 30:05.069
You released her in front of the
station and that was your decision?

30:05.160 --> 30:06.513
Yes.

30:06.600 --> 30:12.152
I messed up the initial contact.
I'd have had to perjure myself.

30:12.240 --> 30:17.553
- Then, what was the fight about?
- That was a personal thing.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.995
- Nothing to do with this?
- No.

30:21.480 --> 30:26.076
Who told you that?
Judson? He's full of shit!

30:29.960 --> 30:33.236
And you're about
to take the sergeant's exam?

30:33.320 --> 30:34.389
Yeah.

30:34.480 --> 30:38.268
- What are you interested in?
- Homicide, what else?

30:38.360 --> 30:40.112
Nothing else!

30:43.680 --> 30:47.832
- This is my wife, Liz.
- Raymond Avilla, nice to meet you.

30:47.920 --> 30:52.471
- You're gonna be late for work.
- I gotta go.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.391
I'm no longer here.

30:57.400 --> 31:02.030
- Where do work on your second job?
- I work at the Galleria.

31:04.720 --> 31:07.871
- Doesn't Van Stretch work there?
- Yeah.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.713
How did you get that?
Every cop in town's after it.

31:14.120 --> 31:18.318
Dennis knows the boss.
He recommended me.

31:19.400 --> 31:23.109
Look, I'm sorry.
This thing just came up.

31:23.200 --> 31:27.716
I don't know, Kath.
I'll be home as soon as I can.

31:27.800 --> 31:30.519
Look, I got to go.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.839
Love you, too. Bye.

31:37.640 --> 31:40.359
This had better be good!

31:49.200 --> 31:52.237
At five o'clock, I got a call from
the watch commander at Northridge,

31:52.320 --> 31:54.117
a guy named Judson.

31:54.200 --> 31:59.149
He said Peck had a beef with a young
vice officer named Dorian Fletcher.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.472
Dennis Peck?

32:11.560 --> 32:13.835
Steven Arrocas?

32:16.080 --> 32:17.149
My wife, Tova.

32:17.240 --> 32:19.071
- Tova.
- How do you do?

32:19.160 --> 32:21.958
Why don't you have a seat?

32:28.560 --> 32:30.915
Would you like a drink?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.468
Yeah. Scotch on the rocks.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.392
I'll get the waitress.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.796
So, how do you know Rudy?

32:47.880 --> 32:51.316
I've known Rudy since I...
How do you know him?

32:51.400 --> 32:53.868
We have contact!

32:55.400 --> 32:58.198
He works for Rudy Mohr, an ex-con.

32:58.280 --> 33:01.875
He got the job through
Rudy Mohr's paid consultant...

33:04.160 --> 33:07.550
- Dennis Peck.
- That's very good.

33:07.640 --> 33:12.589
We need to find out how many others
are moonlighting at the Galleria.

33:12.680 --> 33:18.232
We'd have to go through every single
personnel file in the division.

33:25.720 --> 33:28.439
- So, we're going after Peck?
- Si.

33:38.400 --> 33:42.029
If we blow this or if we're wrong...

33:42.120 --> 33:47.638
..we're fucked.
This is your pile. This is my pile.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.314
My pile's bigger than your pile.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.351
We have a family business.

34:02.440 --> 34:06.513
We manufacture fine floor coverings.
We cover the world.

34:06.600 --> 34:10.831
We're the largest importers
of ceramic tiles in the US.

34:10.920 --> 34:14.594
We import tile from Japan,
France, West Germany, Holland...

34:14.679 --> 34:15.998
Steven.

34:17.560 --> 34:23.112
I run the business.
I've run it for two years.

34:23.199 --> 34:26.795
My parents control the stock,
everything.

34:28.960 --> 34:32.839
They started the company.
They came here with nothing.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.717
They were immigrants.

34:34.800 --> 34:40.476
They did many things I could never
have done and I appreciate that.

34:40.560 --> 34:43.199
But they don't get it.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.511
They won't borrow,
they won't diversify.

34:46.600 --> 34:51.435
They have no idea
how to conduct business today.

34:51.520 --> 34:55.991
We've tried to have them
declared incompetent, but...

34:56.080 --> 35:02.394
But they'd have to be grossly
mismanaging...and they're not.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.516
They're just not bad enough.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.998
I want you to kill
my mother and father.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.232
What?

35:16.320 --> 35:18.675
Rudy said $15,000.

35:20.800 --> 35:26.272
$15,000. Well, I could do it
for $15,000. I could do that.

35:26.360 --> 35:30.717
I could get a couple of gang-bangers
to shoot 'em,

35:30.800 --> 35:33.598
cut their heads off, bury them.

35:33.680 --> 35:38.356
Leave parking tickets
all over the house, names, addresses.

35:38.440 --> 35:39.953
They'd love to talk.

35:40.040 --> 35:43.635
They'll talk about you
and your lovely wife.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.039
What're you saying?

35:45.120 --> 35:48.829
Don't fuck with me! $15,000?

35:51.120 --> 35:53.315
How much do you want?

35:53.400 --> 35:55.470
I'll tell you what'll happen.

35:55.560 --> 35:59.269
You're going to go home
and think about it.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.998
I've thought about it.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.275
Shut up.

36:05.320 --> 36:10.030
And you will call me
in a couple of days.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.918
Nice to meet you, Steven.

36:13.960 --> 36:17.999
- Can I trust you?
- Of course you can trust me.

36:18.080 --> 36:20.719
I'm a cop.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.269
You go home to your wife.

36:27.080 --> 36:30.914
I still gotta pull some files
on Rudy Mohr.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.993
I can do that.
But just be back by 9.00.

37:03.920 --> 37:07.595
- I got a break on the case.
- Great.

37:07.680 --> 37:10.274
Will you close the door? It's cold.

37:27.320 --> 37:32.633
If Peck is handing out extra income
to 40% of the division,

37:32.720 --> 37:36.349
in effect a single officer
can control the division

37:36.440 --> 37:39.079
by pulling favours.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.991
- It's bullshit!
- Why?

37:41.080 --> 37:42.274
Speculation!

37:42.360 --> 37:46.831
Then there's his association
with Rudy Mohr, a convicted felon.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.954
Is it enough for a formal complaint?

37:54.520 --> 37:55.794
No.

37:55.880 --> 37:58.110
Then shut up!

38:01.760 --> 38:03.876
I'm sorry.

38:06.720 --> 38:10.076
But he's the most
productive officer on the force!

38:10.160 --> 38:15.792
Do you want a great cop, who,
at the most, bends it a little bit,

38:15.880 --> 38:19.759
or some straight pistol-ass
who gives diddley,

38:19.840 --> 38:22.752
which this department is full of?

38:22.840 --> 38:26.549
It's not enough
to justify an investigation.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.676
May we get on with it?

38:53.880 --> 38:55.677
OK, so?

38:55.760 --> 39:00.959
It's clear that you're involved
in a pattern of illegal activity.

39:02.400 --> 39:06.712
Now, we know
you're not acting alone, Van.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.997
We're prepared to change
our recommendation of termination,

39:10.080 --> 39:12.548
- if you co-operate.
- How?

39:12.640 --> 39:15.393
You've got to identify the others.

39:15.480 --> 39:20.110
You got to help us obtain
the evidence and testify.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.953
And wear a wire, right?

39:23.040 --> 39:25.315
If necessary.

39:26.880 --> 39:29.440
Do you want to give us a minute?

39:29.520 --> 39:32.034
Can I talk to you?

39:41.800 --> 39:44.837
You're not authorised
to make this deal!

39:44.920 --> 39:47.957
- It's a violation!
- Just look at him.

39:48.040 --> 39:52.033
- He wants to talk.
- I am the senior partner.

39:52.120 --> 39:57.717
Your mistakes go on my file!
Retract the offer to Van or I will.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.598
I've got another idea.

40:00.680 --> 40:03.797
Why don't you and Peck pull them out

40:03.880 --> 40:06.553
and I'll decide which one's bigger?

40:06.640 --> 40:08.471
No deal.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.595
Come on, Van.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.031
Big mistake, Van. Big mistake.

40:38.160 --> 40:42.915
- Do you want some sugar?
- I would like a very little bit.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.912
- That much?
- That's perfect.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.958
Raymond offered me a deal.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.918
Uncle Van doesn't have any tea.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.839
Would you like some sugar?

40:55.920 --> 40:58.195
Would you like some tea?

41:01.200 --> 41:03.873
If I roll over on you, I skate.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.916
You skate?

41:07.000 --> 41:10.276
He doesn't have the authority
to do that.

41:10.360 --> 41:15.229
Don't you understand?
It's just me. I'm all alone!

41:18.720 --> 41:21.393
Look, I got nothing to lose, OK?

41:24.640 --> 41:27.108
I'll put some sugar in hers.

41:29.120 --> 41:32.032
You think I'd wear a wire on you?

41:32.120 --> 41:34.953
Don't you ever threaten me.

41:35.040 --> 41:39.079
Is that enough?
Oh, yes, I love sugar!

42:00.120 --> 42:02.190
You wanted to see me?

42:02.280 --> 42:07.354
Yeah. Thanks for coming. I thought
we should talk about our problem.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.954
Our problem? We have a problem?

42:10.040 --> 42:15.034
Yeah. I don't know how it happened.
We got started on the wrong foot.

42:15.120 --> 42:17.953
Sometimes I come on a little strong.

42:18.040 --> 42:20.554
No hard feelings?

42:22.560 --> 42:24.994
Got a minute?

42:31.920 --> 42:34.718
- Got children?
- No. You?

42:34.800 --> 42:37.234
- Eight.
- Eight?

42:37.320 --> 42:40.949
Yeah. Three by the first marriage,
three by the second,

42:41.040 --> 42:44.157
two by the third,
one from Heather's previous marriage

42:44.240 --> 42:46.310
and number nine's on the way.

42:46.400 --> 42:49.312
- A lot of child support.
- I love kids.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.278
- Do you like 'em?
- Yeah, I like 'em.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.920
Yeah? Don't wait too long to start.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.468
You and your wife OK?

42:59.280 --> 43:01.316
- Yeah.
- Good.

43:01.400 --> 43:03.630
Cos these new couples today,

43:03.720 --> 43:09.113
they get so wound up in their
careers and busy with everything,

43:09.200 --> 43:11.714
their personal life suffers,
you know?

43:11.800 --> 43:16.954
They still do it, but it's like
they have to schedule it.

43:17.040 --> 43:20.191
You don't hug,
you don't kiss, you don't...

43:21.280 --> 43:25.193
You don't do it nice,
fool around like before.

43:25.280 --> 43:29.398
It's such a hurry,
you don't enjoy the pussy any more,

43:29.480 --> 43:33.234
and your wife isn't getting off
like she used to.

43:33.320 --> 43:38.599
Maybe she's... No, no, there's
nothing going on you can point to,

43:38.680 --> 43:41.148
but you start wondering.

43:41.240 --> 43:44.471
You're talking about yourself, right?

43:46.800 --> 43:49.678
No. I'm talking about you, Raymond.

43:49.760 --> 43:51.637
- Me?
- Yeah.

43:51.720 --> 43:56.714
Not because I see it in you.
I see it in your wife, in Kathleen.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.360
You see it in my wife?

43:59.440 --> 44:02.398
Yeah. In fact,
I saw her earlier at the museum.

44:02.480 --> 44:03.435
Yeah?

44:03.520 --> 44:06.990
- She has long blonde curly hair?
- Yeah.

44:07.080 --> 44:12.154
She has green eyes.
She had two earrings in her left ear.

44:12.240 --> 44:17.553
Pretty. A bit skinny for me, but
they say skinny ones give good head.

44:23.920 --> 44:29.040
I'll tell you what. I'll fuck her
a while, teach her how to come...

44:29.120 --> 44:30.075
Get up!

44:36.240 --> 44:39.312
They said you were a good boxer.
You are.

44:39.400 --> 44:44.315
- Not ba...not bad!
- Clean yourself up.

44:44.400 --> 44:46.789
Give my best to Kathleen!

44:52.800 --> 44:53.915
Hi.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.319
Hi.

44:59.880 --> 45:02.633
You know how many wives
Dennis Peck has?

45:02.720 --> 45:03.914
Four.

45:10.160 --> 45:12.879
I want to
run complete bank checks on them.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.393
Mortgages, loans, everything!

45:14.480 --> 45:16.436
What do you say?

45:19.160 --> 45:20.593
Please.

45:33.120 --> 45:37.796
And he opens his bag
and takes out a box.

45:37.880 --> 45:40.758
Remember "Belle de Jour"? The box?

45:40.840 --> 45:45.595
Well, he opens this box
and he takes out a paintbrush.

45:45.680 --> 45:50.470
- What? A paintbrush?
- No, a number 6 sable brush.

45:50.560 --> 45:52.471
Oh, God!

45:54.240 --> 45:57.038
I tell you,
this guy is a great painter!

45:57.120 --> 45:58.917
Hi, Raymond.

46:00.640 --> 46:01.755
Hi.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.719
- Night-night.
- Get some sleep.

46:05.800 --> 46:08.519
I will. Good night, Raymond.

46:18.360 --> 46:22.148
So Carlos is a good painter, is he?

46:24.440 --> 46:27.716
Were you listening
to our conversation?

46:28.800 --> 46:31.030
What did May mean by that?

46:35.400 --> 46:38.995
I think she means
that he's not like Peter,

46:39.080 --> 46:43.517
that he takes his time
and makes her feel good...for once.

46:46.640 --> 46:49.074
Sweetheart, you're a good painter.

46:50.120 --> 46:52.429
When you paint.

46:52.520 --> 46:55.876
I guess I should buy a sable brush.

46:55.960 --> 46:58.554
Yours is fine.

46:58.640 --> 47:01.677
You just need to dip it.

47:27.720 --> 47:30.712
- Hello?
- Penny, it's me, Van.

47:31.720 --> 47:35.998
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

47:36.080 --> 47:38.958
I'm gonna talk to Raymond.

47:41.320 --> 47:44.676
I've got to get
all this stuff off my chest.

47:44.760 --> 47:48.036
- Are you still there?
- I'm here. All what stuff?

47:48.120 --> 47:51.556
All the stuff
we've been doing with Dennis.

47:51.640 --> 47:54.518
I mean, I'm on my own now.

47:54.600 --> 47:57.478
They're gonna throw me off
the force!

47:57.560 --> 47:59.630
Raymond'll cut me a deal.

47:59.720 --> 48:03.508
Don't you think
we should talk about this?

48:03.600 --> 48:06.433
Penny, can I come home?

48:06.520 --> 48:08.112
No.

48:08.200 --> 48:10.839
No, Van not now...

48:10.920 --> 48:13.957
I...I got to get up early tomorrow.

48:14.040 --> 48:18.591
I'll take Sean
to my Mom's in the morning, OK?

48:18.680 --> 48:20.511
Van?

48:21.720 --> 48:23.438
Hello?

48:23.520 --> 48:29.072
Don't say anything to anyone
before you see me, OK?

48:29.160 --> 48:30.991
OK?

48:31.080 --> 48:32.308
OK.

48:32.400 --> 48:35.278
I'm really sorry, Penny.

48:37.360 --> 48:41.876
You know...you know I love you.

48:41.960 --> 48:44.315
Me too.

48:44.400 --> 48:46.231
See you.

49:22.720 --> 49:25.393
So, I talked to Chief Healy.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.635
What did he say?

49:39.200 --> 49:42.078
The guy knows you're a good cop.

49:47.200 --> 49:51.193
I told him you're in a programme.
He liked that.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.639
He's a family guy, too, so...

49:55.720 --> 50:00.953
the sooner you and Penny
get back together...

50:03.640 --> 50:05.915
You'll have to take a suspension...

50:10.480 --> 50:12.311
But...

50:14.880 --> 50:19.829
he's gonna overrule
any recommendation to terminate.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.072
Thanks, partner.

50:29.640 --> 50:31.073
Sure.

50:31.160 --> 50:33.833
You'd do the same for me, right?

50:33.920 --> 50:36.309
You know I would, man.

50:38.880 --> 50:41.155
Thanks a lot.

53:33.880 --> 53:38.476
- 17-Adam-79, officer needs help.
- All units, all units, stand by.

53:38.560 --> 53:43.793
- Go ahead, 17-Adam-79.
- 17-Adam-79, officer needs help.

53:45.520 --> 53:48.717
I'm at the 4,000 block
of West Long Beach.

53:50.640 --> 53:52.596
There has been shooting.

53:52.680 --> 53:56.468
Partner is down and has been shot.
Suspect has been shot and is down.

53:56.560 --> 53:58.391
Request ambulance.

54:46.040 --> 54:47.996
Help me.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.469
All right, all right.

55:04.560 --> 55:06.232
- I'm shot.
- It's OK.

55:06.320 --> 55:08.151
- I'm shot!
- It's OK.

55:08.240 --> 55:10.993
- Oh, my God!
- You're not gonna die.

55:11.080 --> 55:14.390
You're not gonna die. You're not...

55:14.480 --> 55:19.429
- Gotta get back to my patrol.
- It's OK. You're not gonna die.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.795
It's all right. It's OK.

55:39.240 --> 55:41.470
Shut up! Shut up!

56:36.200 --> 56:38.919
What's going on, Raymond?

56:39.000 --> 56:41.560
We eat dinner together twice a week.

56:41.640 --> 56:44.359
I talk about my job, you don't care.

56:45.480 --> 56:48.517
You're not talking to me
about anything.

56:48.600 --> 56:50.431
We don't even fuck any more!

57:16.400 --> 57:18.789
What are you doing?
Working while we're fighting?

57:18.880 --> 57:22.031
- I'm putting the thing away.
- No, no! Don't put it away!

57:22.120 --> 57:26.398
Don't do me a favour.
You continue doing your work,

57:26.480 --> 57:30.359
so you can compare notes
with your little fucking girlfriend!

57:34.360 --> 57:35.429
Hello!

57:42.160 --> 57:46.790
What is that supposed to mean?
My fucking girlfriend?

57:46.880 --> 57:50.509
I'm saying, if you want to
lead a separate life, go ahead!

57:50.600 --> 57:53.876
Do what you want
with your fucking girlfriend!

57:53.960 --> 57:57.270
What do you want to know?
Ask me the question!

57:57.360 --> 58:01.399
- Just tell me!
- What? If I'm fucking my partner?

58:01.480 --> 58:05.792
I am not fucking my partner.
My partner's a dyke!

58:05.880 --> 58:08.713
- Really?
- Really!

58:08.800 --> 58:10.392
It's for you!

58:20.800 --> 58:22.756
Hello.

58:22.840 --> 58:25.115
Van Stretch is dead.
