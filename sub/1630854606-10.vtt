[upbeat music playing]

00:22.689 --> 00:23.565
Emily, hey.

00:23.648 --> 00:26.026
Oh, my God! This is so exciting.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.402
Congratulations.

00:27.485 --> 00:30.530
Your grandmother must be so proud
that you named the restaurant after her.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.657
She is. Come in, I want you to meet her.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.034
-She's here?
-Yeah.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.162
She insisted on coming
to help me cook for the opening.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.538
Aw, sweet.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.130
[in French] <i>Mami,</i>
this is my friend, Emily.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.382
Emily, this is my grandmother - Gigi.

00:49.466 --> 00:53.344
The famous Gigi!
I've heard so much about you.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.889
It is so nice to finally meet you.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.392
-Emily.
-[in English] What? I'm learning.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.728
[in French] Who is this lovely girl?

01:01.811 --> 01:02.979
She's our neighbor.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.439
And the marketing executive
for our restaurant.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.317
-Mmm. American?
-Yes. From Chicago.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.487
[in English] Will you tell her that
I'm close with my grandmother too,

01:10.570 --> 01:13.239
and seeing her here
is really making me miss mine?

01:13.323 --> 01:15.992
Well then, in Paris, you can have me.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.911
-You speak English?
-Of course.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.245
[sighs]

01:19.329 --> 01:21.623
Hey, Emily. I see you've met Gigi.

01:21.706 --> 01:22.832
[Emily] Yeah, so exciting.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.584
I had no idea she was here.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.669
Yeah, for more than a week now.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.130
[in French] Camille. We don't bring
flowers in the kitchen.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.548
It interferes with the aroma of the food.

01:31.049 --> 01:31.966
Oh, of course.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.178
Gigi, be nice.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.138
I'm as nice as I need to be.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.224
[in English] Come here.

01:39.307 --> 01:43.311
I want you to taste this fish soup.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.897
I don't think she wants fish soup
for breakfast.

01:45.980 --> 01:46.981
No, I would love to,

01:47.065 --> 01:49.150
but I'm letting you know
I'm not an expert.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.653
Our food is for everyone.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.032
Ooh! Amazing!

01:56.533 --> 01:58.493
You do have some competition here.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.536
There's no competition.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.788
That's why she's here,
to make me look good.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.456
The first week is so important.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.751
Yeah, but we are closed on Saturday night.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.672
My parents are throwing us an engagement
party at the château this weekend,

02:10.755 --> 02:12.549
and I would love
for you and Alfie to come.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.425
Mindy and her new boyfriend too.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.593
That's very sweet.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.347
Can I get the recipe for that?

02:19.430 --> 02:21.683
Recipe? [chuckles]
There are no recipes.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.561
It's not a list of things. It's a feeling.

02:24.644 --> 02:28.398
You just know when something is right
and when something is wrong.

02:33.903 --> 02:36.156
Thanks to my connection
to the London fashion world,

02:36.239 --> 02:38.491
I'm excited to announce
that we have a meeting

02:38.575 --> 02:42.036
with the legendary house
of Turner & Ascot.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.289
And by connections,

02:44.789 --> 02:48.001
he means the Head of Development
he partied with last night.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.587
-It was a business dinner.
-Oh, really?

02:50.670 --> 02:53.131
I'm not interested in the details.
Please continue.

02:53.214 --> 02:56.926
They are looking for a marketing firm
to help expand their footprint in France

02:57.010 --> 02:59.095
and would like to come in
to hear some ideas.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.098
That's exciting.
I'll start brainstorming this afternoon.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.310
That won't be necessary.
I'm already working on a pitch deck.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.020
I'd like to see it when you're ready.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.021
<i>Bien sûr.</i>

03:08.104 --> 03:10.356
Well, in other exciting news,

03:10.440 --> 03:12.942
Gabriel's reimagined restaurant
opens tonight.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.277
L'Esprit de Gigi.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.614
It's inspired by his grandmother,
who's here from Normandy to help him cook.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.241
You cannot beat a grandmother's cooking.

03:20.325 --> 03:24.370
And I'm hearing Antoine is putting
some real money behind this reinvention.

03:24.454 --> 03:28.291
Yes. And Gabriel is very focused
on getting a Michelin star.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.668
Michelin star? [chuckles] Keep dreaming.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.545
Oh.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.714
There must be
something we can do to help.

03:34.797 --> 03:36.674
No, I'm afraid not.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.219
You know, the whole process
is shrouded in mystery,

03:39.302 --> 03:41.930
and every Michelin inspector is anonymous.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.599
Well, not totally anonymous.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.935
Luc happens to know one intimately.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.853
Me? What are you talking about?

03:49.437 --> 03:50.855
His ex-girlfriend, Marianne.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.190
Oh, which Marianne?

03:52.774 --> 03:54.609
I can neither confirm nor deny.

03:54.692 --> 03:57.195
-Marianne number one.
-How did you know that?

03:57.278 --> 04:00.198
Well, you told me
and anyone else who would listen, so…

04:01.115 --> 04:02.700
[Luc] That's why we broke up.

04:03.493 --> 04:06.704
I was supposed to tell people
she worked for the phone company,

04:06.788 --> 04:09.624
but I let the truth slip out,
and she never forgave me.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.421
[playful music playing]

04:29.227 --> 04:31.688
I can't believe I have to
schedule a lunch to see you.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.524
I know. Nico's calendar is exhausting.

04:34.607 --> 04:35.733
We're out every night.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.777
Ooh! Sounds like you met your match.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.862
-It's exciting.
-[chuckles]

04:39.946 --> 04:42.573
-[gasps] Oh, my God, table by the window.
-What?

04:42.657 --> 04:44.284
It's Camille and Sofia.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.036
-What is Sofia doing in Paris?
-[Camille] I don't know what to do.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.497
I don't understand what happened,
what changed.

04:49.580 --> 04:50.999
We've been… We just…

04:51.082 --> 04:52.166
They're arguing.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.544
-Lovers' quarrel.
-So not funny.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.756
Ah! Hi there!

05:00.508 --> 05:02.969
-Look at you with your <i>coucou.</i>
-I'm gonna go say hi.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.929
Okay, I guess I'm going to, too.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.057
Welcome back to Paris.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.517
-Hi.
-Thank you.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.645
I heard you had
a wonderful time in Greece.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.772
We did. I wish we were still there.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.817
Are you here for the restaurant opening
or for the engagement party?

05:17.900 --> 05:19.277
Uh… [chuckles]

05:19.360 --> 05:22.405
There were some loose ends at the gallery
I needed to tie up.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.366
Um, I hope we get to see you
before you leave.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.826
-Yeah.
-No.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.330
I mean, she has to
go back to Greece tomorrow.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.789
[Sofia] Yes, it's a short trip.

05:31.873 --> 05:35.710
But I love Paris,
so I plan to be here often.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.212
-Great. Great. Great.
-Great. Great.

05:38.296 --> 05:42.008
Well, I hope you have
a great rest of your trip,

05:42.717 --> 05:44.719
and… Well, I'll see you tonight.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.220
Yay! Can't wait.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.805
-Thank you. Bye.
-Okay, bye.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.349
-Bye.
-Bye, girls.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.605
I know what you're gonna say.
"Stay out of it."

05:55.688 --> 05:58.149
No, things are different now.
They're engaged.

05:58.649 --> 06:01.527
Camille's jealous girlfriend from Greece
is here to stop the wedding.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.653
You have to say something.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.989
You are way more excited
than you should be.

06:05.073 --> 06:05.990
Hmm.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.165
[quirky music playing]

06:19.420 --> 06:22.131
[cell phone ringing]

06:22.215 --> 06:23.049
Marianne?

06:23.633 --> 06:26.344
Well, it was interesting to hear from you.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.388
It's been a long time.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.598
And I've missed you terribly.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.350
Really?

06:32.433 --> 06:38.606
I was wondering if <i>I</i> could take you
for dinner, for a change.

06:38.689 --> 06:43.486
Luc, you, me, a restaurant,
is really not a good idea.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.406
But I can be discreet. I promise.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.742
Huh? Marianne, let me prove it to you.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.287
Hello? Marianne?

06:56.707 --> 06:58.334
[in French] Then you put it in…

06:59.669 --> 07:01.045
[speaking indistinctly]

07:08.845 --> 07:10.304
[speaking indistinctly]

07:11.097 --> 07:12.557
[pop music playing]

07:18.604 --> 07:19.689
That's it, that's it, good.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.572
[chuckles]

07:30.867 --> 07:32.368
[jazz music playing]

07:40.668 --> 07:41.711
Wow.

07:41.794 --> 07:45.006
-This place got pretty posh.
-[chuckles]

07:45.089 --> 07:47.091
It's everything he's always dreamed of.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.510
Thanks for everything you did
to make it happen.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.637
-Welcome to L'Esprit de Gigi.
-[Emily] Oh!

07:52.138 --> 07:53.723
-Mwah!
-It's beautiful.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.766
Can't believe it came together so fast.

07:55.850 --> 07:59.520
Well, when Gabriel wants something,
he really makes it happen.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.063
Ooh!

08:01.147 --> 08:02.482
From Gigi. She hates me.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.108
Well, I can't wait to try the food.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.693
Ah, your table's here.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.407
-Hi.
-My favorite people.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.784
Okay, Gabriel is getting fancy.

08:14.744 --> 08:18.206
Remember when he was just a chef here
and he made you eat his meat?

08:18.289 --> 08:19.582
-Mindy.
-Excuse me?

08:19.665 --> 08:21.375
-Sorry, inside joke.
-All right.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.502
[Emily] Um…

08:22.585 --> 08:24.378
-Where's Nicolas?
-He can't make it.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.214
He's got a work event tonight.

08:26.297 --> 08:29.008
As long as that's the real reason
and it has nothing to do with me.

08:29.091 --> 08:32.428
Emily, stop making everything about you.

08:33.012 --> 08:34.764
I told you he's out almost every night.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.976
Oh, I'll be right back.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.021
Hi. Luc.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.775
Emily, what a funny coincidence
seeing you here.

08:46.359 --> 08:50.321
This is my friend, Marianne,
who works at the phone company.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.364
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

08:51.447 --> 08:53.324
I work with Luc at Agence Grateau.

08:53.407 --> 08:56.244
Well, he never mentioned you before.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.746
[in French] We should get to our table.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.299
[in English] Gabriel, my colleague Luc
is here tonight with a woman

09:10.383 --> 09:13.135
he's trying to impress.
A bit of a star, if you will.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.888
Can you make sure
the dishes are extra special?

09:15.972 --> 09:18.182
I make sure of that
for all of my customers.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.934
Who's the client?

09:20.017 --> 09:22.103
Um… Oop!

09:22.186 --> 09:23.062
Emily, <i>bonsoir.</i>

09:23.145 --> 09:25.314
You should not be back here.
It's dangerous.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.275
-Out you go.
-Okay.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.735
[in French] Table nine. Very important.

09:34.198 --> 09:35.908
Good evening.
Have you made some decisions?

09:36.701 --> 09:38.536
She works for the phone company.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.621
So bring whatever, she's not picky.

09:41.205 --> 09:44.083
We'll both have the chef tasting menu.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.294
And I would like to see the wines, please.

09:46.877 --> 09:47.837
Right away, <i>madame.</i>

09:52.508 --> 09:54.927
Did you notice how discreet I was?

09:58.014 --> 09:59.932
I'm telling you the way it happened.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.892
Emily didn't want to leave your party.

10:02.476 --> 10:05.605
She went to apologize to Nicolas,
and he told her to leave.

10:05.688 --> 10:09.650
But… No. That can't be true.
Emily would've told me.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.611
She didn't wanna ruin your night.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.655
She's gonna be pissed I told you.

10:15.865 --> 10:19.201
-But I can't sit by and let that slide.
-And neither can I.

10:23.372 --> 10:27.376
I am so, so sorry
for how Nico treated you.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.838
Oh, God, did Alfie say something?
I didn't want to make it a thing.

10:30.921 --> 10:31.756
You didn't.

10:31.839 --> 10:34.592
But believe me, I'm about to.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.304
But you didn't even
get to try the amuse-bouche.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.021
No, Nico, you're better than that.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.566
You don't get in a pissing match
with my best friend.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.152
After what she pulled,
it's hard to be around her.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.445
You'll have to learn how.

10:57.573 --> 11:00.034
Camille and Gabriel
are having an engagement party

11:00.117 --> 11:01.243
in Champagne this weekend.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.748
Come with me
and you can make nice with Emily.

11:05.831 --> 11:09.210
This weekend we're in Positano
with my family. You know that.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.628
Emily is my family.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.297
So what are you saying?
It's her or me now?

11:13.381 --> 11:14.215
I'm saying that…

11:15.299 --> 11:17.551
I've happily gotten dressed up

11:17.635 --> 11:20.012
and gone to every family dinner
and launch party

11:20.096 --> 11:21.430
that you've invited me to.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.141
I've even pretended
to care about your brother's NFT.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.476
Do not put any money in that.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.484
I'm just asking you
to meet me halfway here.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.864
I'll think about it.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.701
Think hard.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.393
I don't know what Gabriel put on the food,

12:07.476 --> 12:09.145
but I can tell you she liked it.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.522
[gasps] Oh, my God, no way.
What'd she say?

12:11.605 --> 12:14.191
It was not what she said,
it's what she did.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.486
A good meal is like foreplay for her.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.573
And last night she was on fire.

12:23.701 --> 12:26.746
So you think Gabriel might get a star?

12:26.829 --> 12:29.081
Keep your feet on the ground, Emily.

12:29.165 --> 12:32.460
She needs to eat there a number of times
to form a real opinion.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.420
When you two have finished gossiping,

12:34.503 --> 12:37.506
the executives from Turner & Ascot
are in the conference room

12:37.590 --> 12:39.175
-for Julien's pitch.
-Oh.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.301
-Come.
-Yes.

12:43.512 --> 12:46.223
From the Gilded Age
through the Roaring '20s,

12:46.307 --> 12:49.894
Turner & Ascot have empowered
generations of gentlemen

12:49.977 --> 12:52.104
to splash out in bespoke style.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.734
And now that your British invasion
is about to hit French soil,

12:57.318 --> 13:00.237
I'd like to propose a twist
on your venerable brand.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.201
A suit for everybody.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.662
Modern, inclusive, sexy.

13:09.163 --> 13:13.042
This actually goes beyond marketing
into brand creation.

13:13.125 --> 13:17.129
Yes, but marketing does drive
the creation of our brand.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.342
True. We just don't like to come out
and actually say it. [chuckles]

13:21.425 --> 13:23.052
Don't be shy around us.

13:23.677 --> 13:28.015
It's fresh and will expand your influence
to Generation Z and beyond.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.560
But if you want to expand your influence,
why stop at suits?

13:32.102 --> 13:33.354
Why not men in dresses?

13:33.437 --> 13:36.732
You know, Brad Pitt wore one
to a premiere, and it was so hot.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.026
Yes. Was that a dress or more of a kilt?

13:39.109 --> 13:41.070
-I don't even remember.
-[both laugh]

13:41.153 --> 13:44.156
I have always loved the idea
of a skirt for men.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.200
-Oh, yes.
-They are so roomy.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.576
Everything can breathe.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.203
I don't need your pitches.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.121
No, it's not a pitch.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.582
I was piggybacking
off of your brilliant idea.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.335
I don't need a pig on my back.
It's my client.

13:56.418 --> 13:59.755
I'm sorry. I just… I can't stop
thinking about the social campaign.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.091
Men in dresses,
women in Turner & Ascot suits.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.509
Do you have an off switch?

14:03.592 --> 14:04.677
Julien.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.431
[clears throat]

14:12.852 --> 14:14.019
I apologize.

14:17.648 --> 14:18.858
-Should I--
-No.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.359
I've got it.

14:21.610 --> 14:24.738
Imagine how dramatic
his exit would have been in a skirt.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.074
[in French] What was that?

14:27.157 --> 14:29.034
I warned you, but you dismissed me.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.454
Headhunters are after me all the time,
you know.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.374
I understand. I see it now.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.501
I was wrong not to address your concerns.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.129
I don't want you to be unhappy here. Okay?

14:41.547 --> 14:42.631
Please go in there,

14:42.715 --> 14:43.716
finish your brilliant pitch

14:43.799 --> 14:44.633
and we'll discuss this later?

14:46.218 --> 14:47.136
Come.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.266
[softly] I'm sorry.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.736
[pop music playing]

15:43.567 --> 15:45.152
[enchanting music playing]

15:49.698 --> 15:51.951
Jeez, Gabs is really marrying up.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.828
Stop. This place
has been in the family forever.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.583
-Hey, you two.
-Hi. You look stunning!

15:59.667 --> 16:00.584
You look stunning.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.419
I'm so glad you guys could make it.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.297
And I've got your favorite guest room
reserved for you.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.382
Thank you.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.050
The château looks so beautiful.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.051
I know, right?

16:09.677 --> 16:12.638
-Where's Mindy though?
-Hopefully just very late.

16:12.721 --> 16:15.516
Well, everyone's here, except for Gigi.

16:15.599 --> 16:18.727
She didn't want to close the restaurant.
She's cooking tonight.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.688
I told you, she hates me.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.732
Emily. She's back!

16:23.816 --> 16:25.567
I'm back. [laughs]

16:25.651 --> 16:26.652
-Hi.
-You're beautiful.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.695
Oh, thank you.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.197
-This is Camille's father.
-Oh.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.365
The Champère himself.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.659
And this is my boyfriend, Alfie.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.452
Boyfriend.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.621
Ooh, well done. [chuckles]

16:38.205 --> 16:39.957
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.877
-It's a beautiful place you got here.
-[Gérard] Isn't it?

16:43.961 --> 16:45.921
My castle, my empire…

16:54.096 --> 16:55.305
[Gérard] You're welcome.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.724
[Alfie] It's a bugger to get to,

16:56.807 --> 16:58.517
-but I appreciate it.
-Yeah, enjoy, enjoy.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.980
-[exclaims in excitement]
-[in French] Hey, girl!

17:03.063 --> 17:04.982
You look beautiful!

17:05.816 --> 17:06.817
<i>Ma chérie.</i>

17:10.362 --> 17:11.363
[sighs]

17:12.781 --> 17:15.034
[in French] So that's Emily's
new boyfriend.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.411
Not so new.
They've been together for a while now.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.290
I'm happy for her,
but I'm happiest for you.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.085
Do you realize
that you are getting married

17:25.169 --> 17:29.506
and planning a family
at exactly the same age I did?

17:29.590 --> 17:31.300
Honestly, I didn't.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.676
[chuckles]

17:32.760 --> 17:35.262
You and I are more alike than you realize.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.975
I'm so proud of you.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.186
Gabriel's a good man.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.645
And much more ambitious
than I gave him credit for.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.814
You never gave him enough credit.

17:46.398 --> 17:47.524
I do now.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.486
The important thing is our plan worked.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.279
Just like I told you it would.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.533
-See you later.
-See you later.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.334
[sighs]

18:18.722 --> 18:20.307
[sighs]

18:23.060 --> 18:24.061
[scoffs]

18:31.610 --> 18:33.070
[knocking on door]

18:35.656 --> 18:36.782
You didn't blow it.

18:39.618 --> 18:40.953
I'm so glad to hear you say that.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.788
Benoît, what are you doing here?

18:42.871 --> 18:43.789
Can I come in?

18:44.581 --> 18:45.415
Sure.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.548
Sorry to show up like this,
but I just got the news,

18:52.631 --> 18:54.550
and I wanted to tell you in person.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.385
What news?

18:56.468 --> 18:58.720
The reason
I didn't want to sell "Mon Soleil"

18:58.804 --> 19:01.890
is because I had submitted it
to the Eurovision Song Contest.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.477
I didn't want to say anything
in case they didn't choose us.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.437
[chuckles] But they did.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.355
What…

19:09.523 --> 19:11.650
-What are you saying?
-We're going to Eurovision.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.402
Oh, my God!

19:13.485 --> 19:15.154
[both chuckle]

19:17.739 --> 19:19.199
[phone vibrates]

19:24.746 --> 19:26.623
-Where are you?
-Does it matter?

19:26.707 --> 19:28.333
We're never going to make it.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.501
Never say never.

19:35.340 --> 19:39.428
[in French] Gabriel,
this is Father Pierre.

19:39.970 --> 19:40.804
Nice to meet you, Father.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.347
Nice to meet you, Gabriel.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.766
Father Pierre has been part of our family
for a long time.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.769
In fact, he married Gerard and me

19:47.853 --> 19:49.980
in the little chapel right there.
It's 15th century.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.190
Amazing.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.649
And it's available whenever you're ready.

19:53.483 --> 19:54.735
That's all I'm saying.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.528
No pressure.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.531
[in English] Where are we sitting?

20:00.782 --> 20:02.618
Here. So pretty.

20:03.076 --> 20:03.911
Oh, hi, ladies.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.371
-Hi. Hello. How are you?
-Hi.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.956
-Good to see you.
-It's great.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.124
Emily.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.376
-Good to see you.
-Oh!

20:11.460 --> 20:12.878
-I heard you'd be here.
-Hi.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.339
Timothée. [chuckles awkwardly]

20:15.422 --> 20:17.216
Can you stop teasing me, please?

20:17.299 --> 20:18.842
What? I'm not.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.427
No, I'm the one who's teasing.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.012
Oh. [chuckles awkwardly]

20:22.095 --> 20:24.681
[in French] The brother fucker
is at it again.

20:24.765 --> 20:25.766
Yeah.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.018
[In English] Are you going to
introduce me?

20:28.101 --> 20:29.436
Of course. Yeah.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.438
This is Camille's brother, Timothée.

20:31.521 --> 20:33.815
Timothée, this is my boyfriend, Alfie.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.984
Timothée. How's it going, mate?

20:37.402 --> 20:39.363
-Boyfriend?
-Mmm.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.614
Since when?

20:41.865 --> 20:43.659
She's never mentioned you, bro.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.536
Well, that makes two of us, bro.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.500
I'm gonna run to the ladies'.
Grab us drinks, please?

20:51.583 --> 20:53.126
-Sure thing. Sure thing.
-Okay.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.087
Uh…

20:56.338 --> 20:58.757
I hope you take
as good care of her as I did.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.259
She deserves a good man.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.760
I'll certainly do my best.

21:02.803 --> 21:03.804
Yeah.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.433
Wow.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.895
Look, I know you're upset,
but this is the way it has to be for now.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.772
We'll figure things out. I promise.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.067
Gotta go. Bye.

21:19.820 --> 21:20.654
Was…

21:21.238 --> 21:22.406
Was that Sofia?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.366
Why would you think that?

21:24.950 --> 21:27.619
Because I saw you kissing
on the roof at Alfie's party

21:27.703 --> 21:31.331
and then you went to Greece to be with her
and she followed you to Paris.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.294
Emily.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.921
Our secrets are what will keep us close.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.965
I don't want this secret.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.343
You need to tell Gabriel, okay? He…

21:44.011 --> 21:45.053
He deserves to know.

21:45.595 --> 21:46.722
Why?

21:46.805 --> 21:49.224
It was just a fling. It was nothing.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.517
And now it's over.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.728
Just like you and Gabriel, right?

21:54.563 --> 21:55.564
Excuse me.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.322
-[music playing]
-[people chattering indistinctly]

22:04.406 --> 22:06.158
Well, I guess Mindy's a no-show.

22:07.617 --> 22:09.619
Yeah. I guess so.

22:10.203 --> 22:11.288
I feel bad.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.081
[glass clinking]

22:13.165 --> 22:14.583
[Louise in French] Attention, please.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.293
Welcome, everyone.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.170
Um…

22:18.253 --> 22:22.716
I am so happy to have you all here

22:22.799 --> 22:24.509
at our beautiful Château Lalisse

22:24.593 --> 22:28.263
to celebrate the engagement
of Camille and Gabriel.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.639
[all cheer]

22:29.723 --> 22:31.600
[in English] And in your glass,

22:31.683 --> 22:35.145
you will find the latest release
from Domaine de Lalisse,

22:35.228 --> 22:37.981
Chamère, Kir Royale in a bottle

22:38.065 --> 22:40.567
inspired by Camille's friend, Emily,

22:40.650 --> 22:41.818
at Agence Grateau.

22:42.694 --> 22:43.737
Well done, Cooper.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.280
-Thank you.
-[guests clamoring]

22:46.865 --> 22:47.824
Mmm.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.868
Whoa. That's like a fizzy wine cooler.

22:50.619 --> 22:51.453
I like it.

22:52.496 --> 22:56.416
And now, it's my turn to say a few words.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.002
No, not a few.

22:59.086 --> 22:59.920
Many.

23:00.003 --> 23:01.505
[all chuckle]

23:01.588 --> 23:04.216
Since Camille was a child,

23:04.299 --> 23:07.219
she always had good taste in two things.

23:07.719 --> 23:10.013
Art and men.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.391
Or should I say <i>boys?</i>

23:12.474 --> 23:13.600
[helicopter blades whirring]

23:13.683 --> 23:16.019
Because I felt my main job as the father

23:16.103 --> 23:18.313
was to keep them away from her.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.690
-[guests clamoring]
-There were so many guys.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.193
In fact, one is buried just over there.

23:23.276 --> 23:25.654
[in French] What's that thing doing?
What's going on?

23:29.199 --> 23:30.826
[continues indistinctly]

23:33.787 --> 23:34.830
[yells indistinctly]

23:39.751 --> 23:41.253
Hi!

23:45.173 --> 23:46.007
Hi.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.927
Hey!

23:50.178 --> 23:51.388
-You okay?
-Yeah.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.225
Sorry we're late.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.228
You know how to make an entrance.

23:58.311 --> 23:59.229
That's on him.

23:59.312 --> 24:02.649
It was the only way to make it in time,
and I didn't want to miss this.

24:03.483 --> 24:06.027
Or an opportunity
to apologize to you, Emily.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.989
I'm sorry about the other night. Really.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.199
Can we start over?

24:11.700 --> 24:13.243
Absolutely.

24:13.326 --> 24:14.744
-Actually, I would really--
-Shh!

24:14.828 --> 24:17.080
One apology should do it.
We're late enough.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.373
Where should we sit?

24:19.458 --> 24:20.500
[mouthing] Thank you.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.793
[mouthing] I love you.

24:28.175 --> 24:32.304
I'm surprised you really wanted
to come back here so quickly.

24:32.387 --> 24:35.682
I needed to know
if our last meal was just a fluke.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.393
But this one is even better.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.605
Oh, you have sauce on your shirt.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.483
[in French] Welcome to 'L'Esprit de Gigi.'

24:44.566 --> 24:45.859
Are you Gigi?

24:46.359 --> 24:47.194
I am.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.613
But the real chef is my grandson, Gabriel.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.699
He named it in my honor.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.452
I've never had oysters this good.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.205
And this seaweed pudding is a triumph.

24:59.456 --> 25:02.792
It's such a creative and modern way

25:02.876 --> 25:05.629
to revisit
the traditional cuisine of Normandy.

25:05.712 --> 25:06.755
Thanks a lot.

25:07.422 --> 25:08.840
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thanks.

25:08.924 --> 25:09.883
Let me tell you,

25:09.966 --> 25:13.762
that's high praise from the head of
customer relations at the phone company.

25:14.387 --> 25:15.388
[chuckles]

25:15.472 --> 25:16.681
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

25:17.182 --> 25:19.935
[in English] Marianne, you're showing
all of your character.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.354
I don't care. But don't tell anyone.

25:23.605 --> 25:26.650
Life of Chef Gabriel is about to change.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.945
This restaurant is headed
for a Michelin star.

25:35.408 --> 25:37.327
[upbeat music playing]

25:43.959 --> 25:45.377
[laughs]

26:03.562 --> 26:04.980
[indistinct]

26:09.276 --> 26:11.236
It's Luc.
He has something important to tell you.

26:11.319 --> 26:12.237
He's on speaker.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.655
<i>Yes, it's Luc.</i>

26:13.780 --> 26:16.491
You can't know this,
but my girlfriend, Marianne,

26:16.575 --> 26:18.868
wants to give your restaurant
a Michelin star.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.580
What? What is he talking about?

26:22.163 --> 26:23.540
<i>It won't happen overnight,</i>

26:23.623 --> 26:26.209
but keep up this quality,
and you will have it.

26:27.377 --> 26:28.670
I don't know what to say.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.589
<i>Say nothing. Just do your part.</i>

26:30.672 --> 26:31.923
And I'll keep doing mine.

26:33.008 --> 26:36.011
I guess that makes me a star fucker.

26:38.346 --> 26:39.973
[both chuckle]

26:42.267 --> 26:43.768
[both cheer]

26:45.729 --> 26:47.314
This is… This is too much.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.441
I… I don't know how to thank you.

26:50.692 --> 26:55.238
You came to grey Paris
and brought up the sunshine for all of us.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.034
I'm just doing my job.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.076
No, don't say that.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.578
You did this for me.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.747
And I'll never forget it.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.290
Never.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.129
[chuckles]

27:19.095 --> 27:20.263
[exclaims]

27:26.227 --> 27:28.146
[Laurent in French] I think I'm about to
have a very good reason

27:28.229 --> 27:29.731
to spend more time here in Paris.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.983
You mean besides me?

27:32.067 --> 27:33.818
[chuckles]

27:33.943 --> 27:37.405
I'm planning to open a Laurent G in Paris.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.615
A private club.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.241
-Really?
-Yes, an outpost.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.453
This will be its first outpost
outside of Saint-Tropez.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.830
When did this happen?

27:46.539 --> 27:47.999
I've actually been
working on it for a while.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.084
Why haven't you said something?

27:49.668 --> 27:51.503
You've been busy with your own business

27:52.128 --> 27:54.464
and I didn't want to talk about anything
until things got close.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.258
And how close are they?

27:57.842 --> 27:59.803
There's just one more investor
I'm waiting to hear from.

27:59.886 --> 28:02.305
And if he's in,
this place could really be something.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.767
Private membership clubs
are the hottest things right now.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.561
And I can really bring in
the fashion crowd, Laurent. I will.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.814
Together, I think
we will really make this something.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.899
We'll be a team, Sylvie.

28:13.566 --> 28:14.401
This is going to be so much fun.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.363
If Paris won't come to me…

28:21.574 --> 28:22.826
Care to dance?

28:24.786 --> 28:26.246
I'd love to.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.416
[accordion playing jazz music]

28:46.099 --> 28:47.100
What's wrong?

28:48.351 --> 28:51.020
I just don't know
what to do with all of this happiness.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.275
And hopefully by tomorrow

28:56.109 --> 28:57.569
we'll really have something to celebrate.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.989
This guy's ambitions for the club
are even bigger than mine.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.783
Who is this mystery investor?

29:04.617 --> 29:06.453
Only one of the richest men in Paris.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.165
The owner of JVMA, Louis de Leon.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.126
[sighs]

29:17.714 --> 29:19.549
[upbeat music playing]

29:19.632 --> 29:20.467
Camille.

29:21.593 --> 29:22.677
I just heard from a very good source

29:22.761 --> 29:23.762
that my restaurant
is going to get a Michelin star.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.764
-Well done!
-That's wonderful!

29:27.098 --> 29:28.808
Why don't we just get married right now?

29:28.892 --> 29:30.560
We have the priest, we have the chapel…

29:30.643 --> 29:32.854
A surprise wedding!
What a splendid idea!

29:32.937 --> 29:34.522
Exactly!

29:34.606 --> 29:36.566
Why pay for another party
when we're already having one?

29:36.649 --> 29:37.650
<i>Oui.</i>

29:40.904 --> 29:42.655
[Gérard laughs]

29:48.787 --> 29:49.621
I, Gabriel,

29:51.080 --> 29:52.624
take you, Camille, to be my wife.

29:54.834 --> 29:56.252
To have and to hold from this day forward.

29:57.670 --> 29:59.172
For better or for worse, richer or poorer,

30:01.758 --> 30:03.468
in sickness and in health,

30:06.137 --> 30:07.472
to love and to cherish
till death separates us.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.601
I can't believe they're really doing this.

30:13.895 --> 30:14.854
I, Camille,

30:16.439 --> 30:18.233
take you, Gabriel, to be my husband…

30:19.400 --> 30:21.486
to have and to hold from this day forward…

30:22.862 --> 30:24.364
For better or for worse, richer or poorer…

30:26.533 --> 30:28.076
in sickness and in health…

30:29.744 --> 30:30.829
to love and to…

30:33.414 --> 30:34.833
[whispering] You don't have to do this…

30:37.335 --> 30:38.503
[whispering] What are you talking about?

30:39.629 --> 30:40.630
Gabriel…

30:43.341 --> 30:46.678
[in English] Gabriel,
the only reason we're together…

30:48.972 --> 30:51.349
is because I knew
you were in love with Emily.

30:51.933 --> 30:52.767
What?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.143
So…

30:55.812 --> 30:57.146
I made a pact with her…

30:59.107 --> 31:01.109
that neither of us would ever date you.

31:02.735 --> 31:04.237
So you wouldn't see her again.

31:08.324 --> 31:09.868
And then I broke the pact

31:10.577 --> 31:13.496
because I thought I wanted you so badly.

31:15.582 --> 31:17.417
Maybe because I just didn't want to lose.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.376
Camille.

31:18.459 --> 31:19.294
No.

31:21.796 --> 31:22.755
Is this true?

31:25.383 --> 31:26.467
Gabriel,

31:27.218 --> 31:31.097
you and Emily have been in love
with each other since the moment you met.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.642
I can see it in your eyes.

31:37.145 --> 31:40.356
The way she looks at you,
the way you look at her,

31:41.232 --> 31:42.442
anyone can see it.

31:45.695 --> 31:48.948
So no, I'm sorry, I really am,

31:49.991 --> 31:51.659
but I can't marry you.

31:53.494 --> 31:55.830
And it's time
we all just stopped pretending.

31:57.248 --> 31:58.499
[in French] You can't do this!

31:58.583 --> 32:00.752
[shouts] It's done, Mom.
It's my life, not yours!

32:01.294 --> 32:03.004
-Camille…
-Camille, come back!

32:04.631 --> 32:06.132
I knew there was something.

32:08.801 --> 32:09.719
Knew it.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.805
-Alfie, wait.
-Sorry,

32:13.556 --> 32:15.183
but I'm nobody's second choice, Cooper.

32:16.392 --> 32:17.602
Now go and get your man.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.772
-You're my--
-No, I'm not.

32:22.357 --> 32:23.983
I don't think I ever really was.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.899
You really made the pact with Camille
not to be with me?

33:08.611 --> 33:10.530
I thought I was doing the right thing.

33:11.739 --> 33:12.740
For all of us.

33:16.244 --> 33:19.163
And the rest of it? Your feelings for me?

33:25.336 --> 33:26.754
They have always been there.

33:32.176 --> 33:33.511
It's been hard for me too.

33:38.641 --> 33:40.059
What a mess. [sighs]

33:41.853 --> 33:42.979
Emily…

33:46.774 --> 33:48.526
there's something you don't know.

33:51.487 --> 33:55.074
Camille didn't come back from Greece
to revive our relationship. She…

33:58.411 --> 33:59.912
She came back to tell me that…

34:03.875 --> 34:04.834
she's pregnant.

34:08.254 --> 34:09.172
Oh, my God.
