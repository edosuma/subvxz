WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.750
Y'all need
to be concerning yourselves

00:07.833 --> 00:09.291
about the real trouble
around here.

00:09.375 --> 00:10.375
And what's that?

00:10.416 --> 00:13.708
People just-- poof!--
disappearing.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.250
Amy was out hiking.
She found Trevor.

00:19.333 --> 00:20.750
He's dead.

00:20.833 --> 00:22.916
Look, this is important.
Don't let him answer his phone.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.416
He doesn't know about the body.

00:24.500 --> 00:27.000
Where'd you go after
the fight with Trevor?

00:27.083 --> 00:28.541
- To be with a girl.
- Who were you with?

00:28.625 --> 00:30.083
He was with me.

00:30.166 --> 00:32.166
They're hiding
something.

00:32.291 --> 00:34.125
Something
about Trevor.

00:34.166 --> 00:35.541
About the land.

00:37.083 --> 00:40.541
There's more than money
at play here, toots.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.833
He was dead less than ten
hours from when he was found.

00:42.916 --> 00:45.416
- When was he last seen?
- Eight days ago.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.166
Put up that rock
around your neck,

00:48.250 --> 00:50.208
and I'll put up my west pasture.

00:50.291 --> 00:51.916
- What?
- You heard me.

01:21.958 --> 01:23.750
- [ And what you see...

01:23.833 --> 01:26.250
I'm a winner.
Yes, I am, boys.

01:44.666 --> 01:46.958
Get on out here, boys!

01:47.041 --> 01:49.666
I'm home!

01:49.750 --> 01:52.458
Hey! Hey!

01:52.541 --> 01:55.083
Hey! I got something, boys!

01:56.583 --> 01:59.083
Hey! I found it!

01:59.166 --> 02:00.791
I found it.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.333
I found it.
I found it.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.791
Dad?

02:15.916 --> 02:18.000
And Royal.

02:20.375 --> 02:22.375
Do you see what I saw?

02:25.791 --> 02:27.708
- Pa.
- Dad.

02:27.791 --> 02:29.416
Oh, shit. Dad.

03:15.791 --> 03:17.708
"Your Sweet Love"]

04:03.125 --> 04:04.083
Royal.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.958
Royal.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.166
Royal!

04:23.166 --> 04:25.083
Time's a motherfucker.

04:25.166 --> 04:27.541
- Huh?

05:27.291 --> 05:28.958
I mean,

05:29.041 --> 05:31.791
he just dropped
right in front of the kids.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.833
They said it was a stroke.

05:33.916 --> 05:38.333
Well, Wayne's been sick
for-for a while now.

05:38.416 --> 05:39.916
- Yeah. I know.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.541
It was really traumatic.

05:44.166 --> 05:46.125
Does Royal know?

05:46.208 --> 05:47.708
Oh, I-I don't know.

05:47.791 --> 05:49.791
Royal's been gone
since the morning.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.416
Does Patricia have
power of attorney?

05:53.500 --> 05:56.625
Oh. I-I don't know.

05:56.708 --> 05:59.000
- Are you coming
to Bible study later?

05:59.083 --> 06:01.041
Now, when was the last time
I missed Bible study?

06:01.125 --> 06:02.166
Uh-huh.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.041
Kath, I-I got to get out
with the dogs.

06:08.958 --> 06:11.875
Royal! Boys!

06:16.708 --> 06:17.833
Hey.

06:17.916 --> 06:21.375
The other night with Joy,

06:21.458 --> 06:24.458
I should've figured
something different to tell her.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.125
I fucked up.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.708
Sorry.

06:33.750 --> 06:36.416
Well, I fucked up, too,
didn't I?

06:36.500 --> 06:37.541
How's that?

06:39.333 --> 06:41.375
I was dumb enough to help you
in the first place.

06:46.958 --> 06:48.083
Hey.

06:52.250 --> 06:55.916
There's no way I'm gonna
let you go down for this.

07:01.916 --> 07:04.250
Okay?

08:18.250 --> 08:19.666
If you think I'm the type

08:19.750 --> 08:21.666
that won't shoot you
in the back, you're wrong.

08:21.750 --> 08:24.166
Okay,
I'm turning around.

08:29.166 --> 08:31.083
I knocked.

08:31.166 --> 08:34.375
I did knock.
The door was open, so...

08:34.416 --> 08:36.291
My name's Autumn.

08:36.375 --> 08:37.958
I know who you are.

08:39.375 --> 08:41.541
Empty your pockets.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.541
Oh, I was just looking
for something of mine.

08:43.625 --> 08:45.583
Necklace. Your husband has it.

08:45.666 --> 08:46.833
He took it from me yesterday.

08:46.916 --> 08:48.791
- See, we played a hand of...
- Poker.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.125
I heard.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.541
Well, it's not your necklace
anymore, though, is it?

08:54.625 --> 08:57.250
You lost. He won.

08:58.291 --> 09:01.916
That's such a binary way
to look at it.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.750
There's more to everything
than just winning or losing.

09:05.833 --> 09:07.666
Not poker.

09:07.750 --> 09:10.000
Whatever you're doing here,

09:10.083 --> 09:12.291
whatever you're trying
to get done,

09:12.375 --> 09:14.333
I'm not gonna let it happen.

09:14.416 --> 09:16.666
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

09:16.750 --> 09:19.291
Something's already happening.

09:21.916 --> 09:24.291
I need my necklace.

09:25.333 --> 09:26.916
Get out of here.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.916
Has Royal
been acting different lately?

09:36.333 --> 09:38.375
Different how?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.083
Like he's keeping secrets.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.458
Get the hell out of here.

09:52.375 --> 09:55.791
It's hard to really know
anyone else, isn't it?

09:55.875 --> 09:58.791
No matter how long
you've known 'em.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.166
It's hard enough
to know yourself.

10:05.166 --> 10:09.041
Sorry for the trouble,
Mrs. Abbott.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.333
Got the full employee list
and schedule for last week.

10:29.416 --> 10:31.666
Anyone there
we haven't talked to yet?

10:31.750 --> 10:33.791
There's a Hector
on the schedule

10:33.875 --> 10:36.750
four times, but always
with a different phone number.

10:37.750 --> 10:40.708
Damn manager thinks
we give a crap about illegals

10:40.791 --> 10:43.041
- during a murder investigation.

11:02.833 --> 11:04.000
I wasn't involved.

11:04.416 --> 11:06.250
- I don't know anything.
- Hey.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.250
We're not here
for anything else, okay?

11:09.250 --> 11:12.666
Answer our questions truthfully
and we'll be on our way.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.166
Is this one of the men

11:18.250 --> 11:22.666
you saw fighting
in the parking lot that night?

11:25.708 --> 11:27.333
Just him. Not the other one.

11:30.083 --> 11:32.541
Are you sure?

11:33.083 --> 11:35.125
Take another look.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.166
Yes, just him.

11:44.833 --> 11:47.375
Okay. Gracias.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.125
I think I spoke

12:41.208 --> 12:43.291
to a Wayne Tillerson
maybe six weeks ago?

12:43.375 --> 12:45.958
He was in the process
of acquiring some land

12:46.041 --> 12:48.000
and wanted it surveyed.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.666
Surveyed? For what?

12:52.708 --> 12:54.250
Is your head okay?

12:54.333 --> 12:56.000
Yeah.

12:56.083 --> 12:58.083
He never specified.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.875
Are you a friend of his or...?

12:59.958 --> 13:01.208
No, I'm a neighbor.

13:01.291 --> 13:02.708
So, that was it?

13:02.791 --> 13:05.250
- You never heard
from him again?
- No.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.041
Is that all you wanted to know?

13:10.666 --> 13:14.291
Look, there's a rock
on this necklace.

13:14.375 --> 13:17.041
It's... kind of unusual.

13:27.791 --> 13:29.958
Where did you get this?

13:30.041 --> 13:32.125
You know what it is?

13:32.208 --> 13:35.250
The outside is amber.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.500
As far as the rock

13:37.583 --> 13:39.458
encased in it,
the only way to know for sure

13:39.541 --> 13:41.000
is to run tests.

13:41.083 --> 13:42.416
The amber is likely

13:42.500 --> 13:44.583
stabilizing whatever is inside.

13:44.666 --> 13:48.416
Our spectroscopy laser
would provide total composition.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.083
If you left it

13:50.166 --> 13:53.208
here with me,
I-I could investigate.

14:05.125 --> 14:06.458
No.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.333
Thank you for your time, though.

14:12.375 --> 14:15.541
Wait. Are you sure?
I agree it's quite interesting

14:15.625 --> 14:17.250
- and...
- Yeah, I'm sure.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.833
- "BY9."

14:24.916 --> 14:27.666
It's a mining company, maybe.

14:28.708 --> 14:30.666
Yeah. Oh, oh, that's it.
Right there.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.750
Right there. Yeah.

14:32.833 --> 14:34.375
Hey, "contact." "Contact."

14:34.458 --> 14:36.041
- That's it.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.875
- BY9 Mining.

14:45.958 --> 14:47.958
For general inquiries,

14:48.041 --> 14:51.083
dial 307-256...

14:59.208 --> 15:01.625
The number
you have reached, eight...

15:04.458 --> 15:07.000
"From there,
Elisha went up to Bethel,

15:07.083 --> 15:10.500
and some boys came out
of the town and jeered at him.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.416
'Get out of here, baldy,'
they said.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.333
'Get out of here, baldy.'

15:15.416 --> 15:19.291
Elisha looked at them
and called down a curse

15:19.375 --> 15:21.708
on them in the name of the Lord.

15:21.791 --> 15:24.375
And two bears
came out of the woods

15:24.458 --> 15:27.833
and mauled 42 of the boys."

15:29.875 --> 15:31.541
Uh...

15:33.958 --> 15:37.333
So, how does God's judgment

15:37.416 --> 15:39.875
play out in our own lives?

15:39.958 --> 15:41.541
Hmm?

15:41.625 --> 15:43.541
Would anyone like to share?

15:43.625 --> 15:46.041
Well, I don't know
if it's judgment or not,

15:46.125 --> 15:48.833
but the doctor told Walt
he needs his hip replaced.

15:48.916 --> 15:52.083
Course the insurance company
is saying something else.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.750
Hmm.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.458
Anybody else?

16:02.541 --> 16:05.125
Cecilia? How about you?

16:05.208 --> 16:08.583
Um, did today's reading
bring anything to mind for you?

16:08.666 --> 16:11.041
Oh, um...

16:11.125 --> 16:13.041
I guess...

16:13.125 --> 16:15.291
Hmm. I...

16:15.375 --> 16:17.416
I don't know.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.500
I guess, uh...

16:21.500 --> 16:25.000
I just feel a little lost.

16:25.083 --> 16:28.083
Feel a little lost. Yeah.

16:32.125 --> 16:35.416
Do you want us to pray
for you, Cecilia?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.916
Ladies, yeah,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.416
let's all lay hands
on Cecilia here.

16:57.541 --> 17:00.458
"Get Thee Behind Me Satan"]
- Heavenly Father...

17:00.541 --> 17:05.250
look down
on our sister Cecilia here.

17:05.333 --> 17:09.000
- She is lost, dear Father.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.500
Show her the way...

17:12.916 --> 17:15.250
CC? Hi.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.375
Um, look, a few of us are gonna
go over to the Tillersons',

17:18.458 --> 17:20.875
look in on Patricia
and the boys.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.750
- Mrs. Tillerson?
- Oh!

17:48.833 --> 17:50.250
- You have visitors.
- Oh...

17:50.333 --> 17:52.791
- Hi,

17:52.875 --> 17:54.416
Patricia.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.000
We heard about Wayne's stroke.

17:57.083 --> 18:00.500
And, of course, we're all
just heartbroken about Trevor

18:00.583 --> 18:03.500
and we just want you to know
that our prayers are with you.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.916
Cecilia Abbott.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.416
How are you doing, Cecilia?
How's your family?

18:13.875 --> 18:16.291
Everyone alive and kicking?

18:19.833 --> 18:21.333
I see you didn't
bring me anything

18:21.416 --> 18:23.583
like your friends here.
That's a shame.

18:23.666 --> 18:27.458
Idle hands are
the devil's plaything, you know.

18:35.083 --> 18:37.583
Patricia, I know
there's been a lot of tension

18:37.666 --> 18:38.958
- between our families...
- Tension?

18:39.041 --> 18:41.041
Is that what you're feeling?

18:42.458 --> 18:44.541
Tension?

18:46.750 --> 18:48.000
All right.
Well...

18:48.083 --> 18:50.416
No,
not all right, Kath.

18:51.416 --> 18:52.750
You remind me, Cecilia.

18:52.833 --> 18:54.416
You remind me,
and your casserole friends here,

18:54.500 --> 18:56.500
what the Bible says
about killing.

19:37.958 --> 19:40.208
- Oh.

19:41.958 --> 19:43.333
God damn it.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.208
Oh, no.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.250
You're just...

20:26.333 --> 20:27.833
just a baby, aren't you?

20:27.916 --> 20:29.916
Hmm?

20:31.833 --> 20:34.000
What happened to you?

20:46.416 --> 20:48.666
Okay. Okay.

21:03.791 --> 21:05.458
Okay.

21:26.916 --> 21:27.916
Okay.

22:07.375 --> 22:09.791
"Every Rose Has Its Thorn"]

22:13.875 --> 22:14.791
Billy.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.666
Something wrong?

22:20.541 --> 22:24.291
What do you think happens
to animals' souls when they die?

22:30.791 --> 22:33.166
love's a game...

22:33.250 --> 22:35.208
I think the earth
swallows them up.

22:41.375 --> 22:43.791
And sometimes
spits them back out.

22:45.333 --> 22:47.291
right now...

22:47.375 --> 22:50.875
I've had dreams about the
animals in this house and the...

22:50.958 --> 22:55.000
thirst for... vengeance

22:55.083 --> 22:58.458
their brothers and sisters

22:58.541 --> 23:00.375
and fathers,

23:00.458 --> 23:02.958
mothers

23:03.041 --> 23:05.375
must feel.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.666
Let them try.

23:16.416 --> 23:18.916
I wish they would.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.333
Is that what
you would want from us

23:22.416 --> 23:25.000
if somebody killed you?

23:26.416 --> 23:28.083
Vengeance?

23:37.125 --> 23:39.083
Yeah.

23:48.125 --> 23:50.125
I call this guy Bobby.

23:56.541 --> 23:59.125
- Yeah.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.041
Fuck him.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.333
There's no power of attorney,
no will,

24:21.416 --> 24:23.125
no anything
that allows us to do business

24:23.208 --> 24:24.916
while he's incapacitated
like this.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.125
Baby, you're his son.
You just tell people

24:26.208 --> 24:27.333
what you want done,
and they'll do it.

24:27.416 --> 24:29.541
- Not the bank.
- Yes, the bank. Everyone.

24:29.625 --> 24:32.083
Luke, honey, listen to me.

24:32.166 --> 24:35.125
You need to start
acting more like him.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.916
- You think he would let anyone
take any of his shit?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.750
I'm not him, am I?

24:39.833 --> 24:41.750
No.

24:41.833 --> 24:43.833
You're not.

24:47.833 --> 24:50.750
Do you really have no idea
why he wanted that Abbott land?

24:50.833 --> 24:52.416
No.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.500
It's not for grazing, though.

24:56.166 --> 24:58.500
- Maybe gas or trona?
- Huh?

25:00.208 --> 25:02.750
Who knows, maybe it came to him
in one of his fucking dreams.

25:02.833 --> 25:04.375
Have you asked Billy?

25:04.458 --> 25:06.125
Have I asked Billy?

25:07.791 --> 25:09.916
Well, Wayne is
a certified son of a bitch,

25:10.000 --> 25:11.458
but he's got a nose
for things like this.

25:11.541 --> 25:12.916
Are you serious?

25:14.583 --> 25:16.208
We've been talking for days now

25:16.291 --> 25:18.583
about how he's off
his goddamn rocker and all that.

25:18.666 --> 25:20.958
I mean,
you said that to him yourself.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.750
Luke, honey,

25:22.833 --> 25:24.541
just because
you say something to a person

25:24.625 --> 25:27.125
doesn't necessarily mean
you mean it.

25:28.166 --> 25:29.458
If I were you, I'd find a way

25:29.541 --> 25:31.333
to get that land.

25:45.833 --> 25:47.500
- Hey.

25:47.583 --> 25:49.166
We're getting food
from Lynette's.

25:49.250 --> 25:50.625
I know you like
that chicken they have.

25:50.708 --> 25:52.250
You know how many times
I sat with Perry,

25:52.333 --> 25:55.375
right here in this office,
talking about Rebecca?

25:55.458 --> 25:57.583
Where she could be,
what might have happened to her?

25:57.666 --> 25:59.083
I know it.

26:11.625 --> 26:13.541
Election's in three weeks.

26:13.625 --> 26:15.875
People understand
these things take time.

26:15.958 --> 26:18.041
What do you think?

26:18.125 --> 26:20.208
Think Perry did it?

26:20.291 --> 26:22.791
With the help of his family?

26:22.875 --> 26:25.000
I don't know.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.000
I really don't.

26:27.083 --> 26:29.125
What's your gut say?

26:30.166 --> 26:31.708
He's a good man.

26:33.708 --> 26:35.541
Good man.

26:41.750 --> 26:43.166
When...

26:44.583 --> 26:47.666
When I was about ten years old,
I...

26:47.750 --> 26:50.500
was friends with a girl,

26:50.583 --> 26:54.208
a white girl
who lived on a ranch

26:54.291 --> 26:56.291
near the reservation
where I grew up.

26:58.291 --> 27:00.916
And one day,
her uncle and one of his buddies

27:01.000 --> 27:03.375
saw me walking home
from school alone.

27:03.458 --> 27:05.625
They pulled over
and asked me if I wanted a ride.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.875
And I knew
if I got in that truck,

27:07.958 --> 27:09.333
something bad
would happen to me.

27:09.416 --> 27:12.000
And so I said no,
and I kept walking.

27:13.416 --> 27:15.541
And they came at me,
and I fought them off,

27:15.625 --> 27:17.125
and I ran to the woods,
and I made it home.

27:17.208 --> 27:18.625
And my parents...

27:20.208 --> 27:22.041
They said they couldn't
do anything about it

27:22.125 --> 27:25.333
because white folks
don't get charged

27:25.416 --> 27:28.250
for attacking Indian girls
on a reservation.

27:29.291 --> 27:31.291
Just doesn't happen.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.416
You never told me that before.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.333
Something inside me was talking,

27:39.416 --> 27:42.000
and I listened.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.625
He did it.

27:57.708 --> 27:59.833
Macaroni salad.

27:59.916 --> 28:02.833
- Huh?
- With the chicken.
At Lynette's.

28:03.875 --> 28:05.041
Okay.

28:12.916 --> 28:14.833
Where's Dad?

28:14.916 --> 28:17.875
Don't know. He left real early.

28:26.541 --> 28:28.625
Where'd he go?

28:32.583 --> 28:34.833
The hell is going on with him?

28:34.916 --> 28:36.916
Oh,
he's always been...

28:41.791 --> 28:44.291
It's in me, too, you know.

28:45.333 --> 28:46.708
What?

28:49.125 --> 28:51.041
What's in him.

28:55.708 --> 28:58.000
And what's... not.

29:03.041 --> 29:05.375
It's hard enough
to know yourself,

29:05.458 --> 29:07.250
let alone anyone else.

29:17.958 --> 29:19.625
I'm gonna grab a beer in town.

29:39.125 --> 29:41.041
Sorry.

29:41.125 --> 29:43.125
- Didn't mean to interrupt.
- You didn't.

29:43.208 --> 29:45.041
Is your dad around?

29:45.125 --> 29:46.875
No.

29:46.958 --> 29:48.541
Sorry.

29:48.625 --> 29:50.041
Stop saying you're sorry.

29:50.125 --> 29:52.000
What're you doing out here?

29:52.083 --> 29:54.625
Thought I might run into Royal.

29:54.708 --> 29:55.958
No luck.

29:56.041 --> 29:59.166
Decided to get in
a quick mindfulness session.

29:59.250 --> 30:01.333
Mindfulness?

30:01.416 --> 30:03.416
Mindfulness.

30:05.416 --> 30:08.625
What are you doing out here
past your bedtime?

30:09.666 --> 30:11.583
Uh...

30:11.666 --> 30:13.500
I just want to...

30:16.083 --> 30:17.583
...be alone.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.291
Sorry.

30:24.333 --> 30:26.916
There's a place.
Not in town.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.750
It's, uh, different.

30:28.833 --> 30:32.250
It's kind of wild, but...

30:34.250 --> 30:36.416
...you might like it.

31:30.041 --> 31:32.208
You ready for Saturday?

31:33.250 --> 31:34.291
Sorry?

31:34.375 --> 31:36.333
The finals.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.958
Ready as I'll ever be.

31:40.875 --> 31:42.291
Thank you.

33:14.375 --> 33:17.333
I think people have
always thought I was strange.

33:17.416 --> 33:20.333
Or worse. Defective.

33:20.416 --> 33:23.916
My family thinks that,
that's for sure.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.500
Yeah.

33:25.583 --> 33:29.500
Pretty sure my family
thinks that about me, too.

33:33.125 --> 33:35.041
What?

33:35.125 --> 33:37.708
I think your family's
really special,

33:37.791 --> 33:39.125
but if they think that
about you,

33:39.208 --> 33:41.041
then they're wrong.

33:41.125 --> 33:42.708
Mm.

33:44.458 --> 33:47.541
How did you meet your wife?

33:48.750 --> 33:50.583
College.

33:51.750 --> 33:53.583
UW.

33:57.583 --> 34:01.083
She was from, uh, California.

34:01.166 --> 34:03.166
Near Bakersfield.

34:10.541 --> 34:13.750
She wanted to move back there
after school.

34:19.750 --> 34:22.083
We argued about it a lot.

34:24.083 --> 34:26.000
We, uh...

34:38.000 --> 34:41.416
The last night I saw her,
we argued.

34:55.416 --> 34:57.416
I went to bed.

34:59.416 --> 35:02.000
I woke up a few hours later.

35:03.416 --> 35:05.416
And she wasn't there.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.333
M-Maybe she walk-walked off

35:12.416 --> 35:14.000
and something happened.

35:21.666 --> 35:25.166
Or maybe she was just fed up.

35:25.250 --> 35:26.750
I...

35:26.833 --> 35:29.250
And maybe I'll never know.

35:43.291 --> 35:44.708
What if I told you

35:44.791 --> 35:48.583
it's possible to understand
what happened to her

35:48.666 --> 35:52.541
even without knowing
exactly what happened to her?

35:52.625 --> 35:54.666
What do you mean?

35:55.708 --> 35:57.708
What you're going through...

35:59.541 --> 36:01.625
What if it's...

36:01.708 --> 36:03.708
bigger than you?

36:05.708 --> 36:08.541
Bigger than all of us.
