03:18.932 --> 03:20.333

03:22.969 --> 03:24.470

He gave me his card.

The first one doesn't either.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.354

05:13.479 --> 05:18.017
Well, um, I don't normally
wear much makeup,

05:18.084 --> 05:19.819
so I'm a little out
of my depth.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.321
Which brings us
to lesson number one.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.525
In sales, confidence is key.

05:25.591 --> 05:26.893
{\an6}Oh.

05:25.591 --> 05:26.893
Are you confident?

05:26.959 --> 05:29.028
{\an6}No.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.028
I knew the answer to that,

05:29.095 --> 05:31.097
but that's gonna be
our little secret,

05:31.164 --> 05:33.099
{\an1}because just like
this full-coverage concealer

05:33.166 --> 05:36.469
for all skin types, we're gonna
cover that right on up. (laughs)

05:36.536 --> 05:39.372
{\an5}I'm all for that.

05:36.536 --> 05:39.372
Now before we go further,

05:39.439 --> 05:41.841
{\an1}I am gonna have
to ask for a check

05:41.908 --> 05:44.577
{\an1}for your sample kit
and your start-up accessories.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.746
Oh. I was under the impression

05:46.813 --> 05:48.514
that I would take orders,

05:48.581 --> 05:50.750
and the customers would pay
for it later,

05:50.817 --> 05:52.685
like, um, Girl Scout cookies.

05:52.752 --> 05:57.056
{\an1}I'm sorry. Do you see
Thin Mints in this case?

05:57.123 --> 06:00.493
{\an6}No.

05:57.123 --> 06:00.493
This is a serious business.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.828
If you are not serious,

06:01.894 --> 06:03.996
maybe you are not ready
to join my team.

06:04.063 --> 06:05.631
Oh, I... I am serious.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.735
It's just that my husband
isn't totally on board,

06:08.801 --> 06:11.738
and he'll be upset
if I spend a bunch of money.

06:11.804 --> 06:13.573
Oh, well, that's fair.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.743
{\an1}If you have to ask his
permission, I can come back.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.611
It's refreshing really.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.413
It reminds me of a simpler time

06:20.480 --> 06:23.883
when men made the decisions
and women made the beds.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.785
I'm gonna get my checkbook.

06:25.852 --> 06:28.688
{\an1}Now there is a take-charge
makeup salesperson. (chuckles)

06:29.655 --> 06:34.927
I am the organ grinder,
and the world is my monkey.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.403
All righty then.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.472
{\an5}Show me what you got.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.472
What do you mean?

06:46.539 --> 06:49.075
{\an1}Your sales technique.
Let's go. Come on.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.110
I'm an Eskimo.
Sell me some ice.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.079
Really? Right now?

06:53.146 --> 06:56.549
If you can't sell to me,
and I'm already Team Mary,

06:56.616 --> 06:59.018
how are you gonna sell
to a stranger?

06:59.085 --> 07:01.120
Okay. Um...

07:01.187 --> 07:03.089
Hi.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.591
{\an5}Let me stop you right there.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.591
What did I do wrong?

07:05.658 --> 07:07.627
(sighs)
It's your face.

07:07.693 --> 07:08.895
What's wrong with my face?

07:08.961 --> 07:11.097
It's your number one sales tool.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.132
{\an1}Y-You should be
advertising the product,

07:13.199 --> 07:14.567
and you're not wearing any.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.936
{\an6}Yes, I am.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.936
{\an1}Where?

07:17.003 --> 07:20.439
I think the best makeup is
the kind that no one notices.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.475
Right now,
<i>you're</i> what no one notices.

07:22.542 --> 07:24.977

and I'm... (sputters)

07:25.044 --> 07:26.579
...driving right on by.

07:26.646 --> 07:28.981
I suppose
I could put on a little more.

07:29.048 --> 07:32.051
Attagirl! They've already
seen the before.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.587
Let's show 'em the after. Here.

07:34.654 --> 07:35.988
Try this.

07:36.055 --> 07:38.124
That's awfully red.

07:38.191 --> 07:42.562
Exactly. And when you see red,
what comes to your mind?

07:42.628 --> 07:45.731
{\an6}Satan.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.731
{\an1}Glamour.

07:45.798 --> 07:49.202
Sex appeal,
a little va-va-voom!

07:49.268 --> 07:50.503
I don't know.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.872
You are not just selling makeup.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.674
You are selling power,

07:54.740 --> 07:58.144
you are selling confidence,
and that starts right here.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.780
Now are you a powerful,
confident woman?

08:00.847 --> 08:02.615
Yes.

08:02.682 --> 08:05.251
Slather this on.
Let's try again.

08:06.686 --> 08:07.753
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.890
Somebody call highway patrol.

08:10.957 --> 08:12.525
This billboard
is causing accidents.

08:12.592 --> 08:13.993
{\an6}Really?

08:12.592 --> 08:13.993
You had the va,

08:14.060 --> 08:15.995
{\an1}then you got another va,
now you got the voom.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.063
Sell me some makeup.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.031
Hello there.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.033
{\an5}Now I'm listening.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.033
{\an3}Oh.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.835
Mom, I know what I want to do

08:22.902 --> 08:23.903
for spring break.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.504
What happened to your face?

08:25.571 --> 08:27.173
{\an1}Told you,
people take notice.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.841
This is for my new job.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.276
Is your new job
fighting Batman?

08:30.343 --> 08:31.777
Because you look like The Joker.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.179
What do you want?

08:33.246 --> 08:34.714
Can I take
a four-and-a-half-hour bus ride

08:34.780 --> 08:36.916
to Texarkana
for a comic book convention?

08:36.982 --> 08:38.918
By yourself? Absolutely not.

08:38.985 --> 08:40.653
{\an5}Can you come with me?

08:38.985 --> 08:40.653
{\an1}No.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.788
{\an1}Son, your mother
has makeup to sell.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.557
If I get an adult
to go with me, can I?

08:44.624 --> 08:46.792
I don't know. Maybe.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.629
Ha, ha. No.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.931
But people wear makeup
to comic book conventions.

08:51.998 --> 08:53.065
You could sell it there.

08:53.132 --> 08:56.002
{\an5}Ah, I see. No.

08:53.132 --> 08:56.002
{\an3}But...

08:56.068 --> 09:00.106
Read my moisturized lips. No.

09:00.172 --> 09:03.042
♪ No-no, no, no, no,
no, no-no, no... ♪

09:03.109 --> 09:05.311
Would you like to go with me
to a comic book convention?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.946
Will there be girls there?

09:07.013 --> 09:09.582
♪ No-no, no, no,
no-no, no, no ♪

09:09.649 --> 09:10.816
♪ No, no-no... ♪

09:10.883 --> 09:12.251
And if you order right now,

09:12.318 --> 09:14.086
I'll throw in some extra
concealer for half off.

09:14.153 --> 09:15.922
I mean, this is just allergies.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.690
Does it look
like I've been crying?

09:17.757 --> 09:19.859
No! No.

09:19.926 --> 09:21.260
And the best news is

09:21.327 --> 09:23.029
it's only a four-and-a-half-hour
bus ride away.

09:23.095 --> 09:25.031
{\an3}So you want me to ride
on a bus for hours

09:25.097 --> 09:27.266
{\an3}with a bunch of kids
to a comic book convention?

09:27.333 --> 09:29.001
It's mostly adults.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.770
Many are in costumes.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.838
No.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.073
{\an1}Oh.

09:34.140 --> 09:37.109
You look fantastic.

09:37.176 --> 09:38.678
Ready to buy?

09:38.744 --> 09:40.646
No,

09:40.713 --> 09:42.848
but I'm ready
to hit the dog track.

09:43.983 --> 09:45.584
And since we're both
on spring break,

09:45.651 --> 09:47.119
I thought
you might like to go with me.

09:47.186 --> 09:49.722
Sheldon, I am the president
of the university.

09:49.789 --> 09:51.691
You're right.
I should've asked you first.

09:51.757 --> 09:52.925
So is that a "yes"?

09:52.992 --> 09:54.860
No!

09:54.927 --> 09:56.295
{\an3}Sorry.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.264
No.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.333
{\an5}And what do you want?

09:58.331 --> 10:00.333
For you to go

10:00.399 --> 10:03.169
on a bus with me to a comic book
convention in Texarkana.

10:03.235 --> 10:05.604
(laughing):
God, no.

10:06.872 --> 10:08.074
I don't know.

10:08.140 --> 10:11.010
{\an1}Trust me, the men are
gonna be lining up.

10:11.077 --> 10:13.346
Well, they haven't been so far,

10:13.412 --> 10:16.015
{\an3}and I've been basically
giving it away.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.884
That's your business really.

10:18.951 --> 10:22.121
{\an1}But, hey, I am not
just selling makeup.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.323
I am selling confidence.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.292
{\an6}You are?

10:24.390 --> 10:26.292
{\an1}I sure am.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.161
Now, are you a strong
and confident woman?

10:29.228 --> 10:30.363
Not remotely.

10:30.429 --> 10:33.199
Well, do you want to be?

10:33.265 --> 10:35.234
{\an3}I guess.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.738
Here. Why don't you put this on,

10:38.804 --> 10:40.940
and we will try again?

10:42.742 --> 10:45.077
{\an1}Oh.

10:46.278 --> 10:49.315
{\an1}Now, are you a strong,
confident woman?

10:49.382 --> 10:52.051
{\an6}Sure.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.051
{\an1}Come on. Say it
like you mean it.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.253
Are you strong and confident?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.789
{\an6}Yes.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.789
One more time.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.324
{\an3}Yes.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.926
{\an1}So I can put you down
for a starter kit?

11:00.993 --> 11:02.294
{\an3}Fine.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.230
Well, all right!

11:04.296 --> 11:05.765
{\an1}Whoo!

11:05.831 --> 11:08.334
You never forget
your first sale.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.703
I know. I am still tingling.

11:10.770 --> 11:11.971
I love that feeling.

11:12.038 --> 11:13.372
I don't even
drink coffee anymore.

11:13.439 --> 11:15.207
{\an5}I just go on tingle power.
(laughs)

11:13.439 --> 11:15.207
{\an1}(laughs)

11:15.274 --> 11:18.144
And she didn't just
get the starter kit.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.946
She got the mud mask,
she got the exfoliator.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.049
I had a feeling about you, Mary.

11:23.949 --> 11:26.052
{\an3}It's just a matter of time
before you're behind the wheel

11:26.118 --> 11:29.722
{\an3}of your own pink Cadillac,
and take it from me,

11:29.789 --> 11:32.725
you will be stared at. I am.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.894
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.894
{\an3}Mm.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.330
So, where do I go from here?

11:38.397 --> 11:40.800
I've kind of talked
to everybody I know.

11:40.866 --> 11:45.304
Mm. Well, new faces are the
lifeblood of our business.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.174
How do I find new faces?

11:48.240 --> 11:50.376
Don't you run a Bible study?

11:50.443 --> 11:53.379
Uh, I don't know
that I'd be comfortable

11:53.446 --> 11:55.815
trying to make sales
in a religious setting.

11:55.881 --> 11:59.985
Mary, if God didn't want people
to wear makeup,

12:00.052 --> 12:02.221
he'd have made 'em less ugly.

12:02.988 --> 12:06.492
{\an4}Well, that's one way
to look at it.

12:02.988 --> 12:06.492
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.394
And you have a daughter, right?

12:08.461 --> 12:10.329
{\an1}Well, she's not even
a teenager yet.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.031
This is when it starts.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.767
Would you rather her
borrowing makeup from friends,

12:14.834 --> 12:16.202
passing it back and forth?

12:16.268 --> 12:19.105
{\an4}She has stolen it
from my bag.

12:16.268 --> 12:19.105
{\an3}See?

12:19.171 --> 12:21.874
{\an5}Forget about a pink Caddy.
Now we're talking pink eye.

12:19.171 --> 12:21.874
{\an1}Hmm.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.943
Which, if she does catch it,

12:24.009 --> 12:26.512
{\an3}a little waterproof
eyeliner, you'd never know.

12:30.349 --> 12:32.118
{\an5}ANNOUNCER:
Attention, science fiction
and comic book fans,

12:32.184 --> 12:34.854
{\an5}this Friday, Saturday and Sunday
in Ballroom B

12:34.920 --> 12:37.289
{\an5}of the Texarkana Holiday Inn,
it's Texarkana-Con!

12:37.356 --> 12:39.091
That's right, Texarkana...

12:39.158 --> 12:40.459
Khan!

12:40.526 --> 12:42.995
{\an5}Celebrity appearances,
panel discussions,

12:43.062 --> 12:44.964
{\an5}autograph alley,
only at Texarkana...

12:45.030 --> 12:46.332
Khan!

12:46.398 --> 12:48.234
Raffles, prizes, costume parade,

12:48.300 --> 12:50.803
{\an5}Friday through Sunday
at Texarkana...

12:50.870 --> 12:52.138
Khan!

12:52.204 --> 12:53.472
{\an5}ANNOUNCER:
William Shatner not appearing.

12:53.539 --> 12:56.375
William Shatner
may not be appearing,

12:56.442 --> 12:58.544
but Sheldon Cooper is.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.921
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>I was normally a rule follower,</i>

13:08.988 --> 13:10.322
<i>but one of the rules</i>

13:10.389 --> 13:13.425
<i>of spring break is to cut loose</i>
<i>and break rules.</i>

13:15.060 --> 13:15.995
I'm heading out.

13:16.061 --> 13:17.096
Where you going?

13:18.063 --> 13:20.166
To see my comic book friends.

13:20.232 --> 13:22.134
Hmm. I'm leaving in a few.
You want a ride?

13:22.201 --> 13:23.802
No, I'm taking my bike.

13:23.869 --> 13:26.238
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>All the way to the bus station.</i>

13:26.305 --> 13:27.306
Something funny?

13:27.373 --> 13:29.408
Not funny. Just normal.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.177
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Smooth.</i>

13:31.243 --> 13:32.945
Bye.

13:33.012 --> 13:35.247
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>So smooth.</i>

13:40.986 --> 13:42.054
(metallic trilling)

13:51.530 --> 13:54.366
Hey, you made it.

13:54.433 --> 13:56.902
It would have been illogical
not to.

13:56.969 --> 13:59.905
{\an5}(deep voice):
Well, you're going
to have a blast.

13:59.972 --> 14:02.975
{\an1}I know this is un-Spock-like,
but I can't stop smiling.

14:03.042 --> 14:05.077
There you are, dear sir.

14:05.144 --> 14:08.147
Let's get
this pusillanimous bucket

14:08.214 --> 14:10.516
{\an5}of nuts and bolts on the road.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.516
(applause and cheering)

14:10.583 --> 14:12.218
We have a comic-con to get to!

14:12.284 --> 14:14.186
Mr. Givens?

14:14.253 --> 14:16.288
Oh, the pain.

14:19.124 --> 14:20.059
MARY:
<i>So, today</i>

14:20.125 --> 14:21.093
I thought maybe

14:21.160 --> 14:23.229
we'd mix things up a little bit,

14:23.295 --> 14:25.064
{\an3}and do some reading
from Esther.

14:25.130 --> 14:26.932
I don't think
I've ever read Esther.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.001
Oh, you are in for a treat.

14:29.068 --> 14:31.070
There is some good stuff
in here.

14:31.136 --> 14:33.272
Let us open our Bibles

14:33.339 --> 14:36.942
to, uh, chapter two, verse 12.

14:38.177 --> 14:39.578
"Before a young woman's
turn came

14:39.645 --> 14:41.280
"to go into King Xerxes,

14:41.347 --> 14:45.317
"she had to complete 12 months
of beauty treatments

14:45.384 --> 14:48.287
"prescribed for the women:
six months with oil of myrrh

14:48.354 --> 14:51.657
and six with perfumes
and cosmetics."

14:51.724 --> 14:53.892
Did anyone else realize

14:53.959 --> 14:56.095
that cosmetics were right here
in the Bible?

14:56.161 --> 14:58.364
I just find that fascinating.

14:58.430 --> 14:59.598
Uh, well, t-this next verse

14:59.665 --> 15:01.600
talks about her
being a concubine.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.636
Hey, hey, don't skip ahead.

15:03.702 --> 15:05.304
We're still talking cosmetics.

15:05.371 --> 15:09.208
Did you know that Esther
used her beauty

15:09.275 --> 15:11.410
to stop a genocide?

15:11.477 --> 15:12.411
Really?

15:12.478 --> 15:14.313
Sometimes, I think we forget

15:14.380 --> 15:16.649
how powerful beauty can be.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.284
But I know I sure

15:18.350 --> 15:19.918
feel powerful when I'm wearing

15:19.985 --> 15:23.522
this new line
of Mary Kay cosmetics.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.957
Take a gander, ladies.

15:27.459 --> 15:29.962
So how do you know
Dr. Smith over there?

15:30.029 --> 15:31.697
That's not Dr. Smith,
that's Mr. Givens.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.532
He was my high school
science teacher.

15:33.599 --> 15:37.703
Oh. Well, he's dressed as
Dr. Smith from <i> Lost in Space.</i>

15:37.770 --> 15:39.438
Oh, I've never seen it.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.473
Yeah, well, you're
not missing much.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.676
It was a lame kids' show.

15:43.742 --> 15:46.378
I'm sorry, "lame kids' show"?

15:46.445 --> 15:48.213
For your information,
<i>Star Trek</i> wouldn't exist

15:48.280 --> 15:49.581
without <i> Lost in Space.</i>

15:49.648 --> 15:51.517
(all oohing)

15:51.583 --> 15:52.584
{\an1}NATHAN:
Yeah, well,

15:52.651 --> 15:54.386
at least <i> Star Trek</i>

15:54.453 --> 15:57.156
didn't have to steal its robot
from <i> Forbidden Planet.</i>

15:57.222 --> 15:58.991
(all oohing)

16:00.426 --> 16:02.594
I take it from their reaction
that was a good dig?

16:02.661 --> 16:04.563
{\an5}Solid.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.563
Nice job.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.198
Well, if <i> Star Trek</i> is so great,

16:06.265 --> 16:07.299
how come <i> Lost in Space</i>

16:07.366 --> 16:09.335
kicked its butt in the ratings?

16:09.401 --> 16:10.736
(all oohing)

16:10.803 --> 16:14.373
{\an3}Well, if <i> Lost in Space</i>
is so great,

16:14.440 --> 16:16.675
{\an3}how come no one's
ever remade it?

16:16.742 --> 16:19.111
{\an1}That's true, they're still
making <i> Star Trek</i> movies

16:19.178 --> 16:20.579
and a new series.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.349
{\an3}Yeah, which is even
better than the original.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.050
(all oohing)

16:25.117 --> 16:26.652
I'm sorry, what did you say?

16:26.719 --> 16:29.054
You heard me,
<i>Star Trek: Next Gen</i>

16:29.121 --> 16:31.023
is better than <i> Original Series.</i>

16:32.524 --> 16:35.094
<i>Lost in Space</i> brought me hours
of happiness as a child,

16:35.160 --> 16:37.496
you... jerks.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.332
Esther would be so proud.

16:40.399 --> 16:43.335
This is a face that would stop
the spilling of blood.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.070
{\an5}You think?

16:43.402 --> 16:45.070
I do.

16:45.137 --> 16:48.340
Now, if you order the
starter package today,

16:48.407 --> 16:50.376
I will throw in
the spring palette.

16:50.442 --> 16:51.510
Sold.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.012
Oh, praise the Lord.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.114
Now who's next?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.482
Okay, I enjoy Mr. Data,

16:56.548 --> 16:58.283
but he's clearly
just a Spock rip-off.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.218
(all murmuring)

16:59.284 --> 17:00.486
Oh, I'm sorry,

17:00.552 --> 17:02.488
Mr. Data wants to be more human,

17:02.554 --> 17:04.021
Spock wants to be less human.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.424
How is that the same?

17:05.491 --> 17:06.791
ALL:
Yeah!

17:06.858 --> 17:08.327
{\an1}Well, I think we can all agree
that William Shatner

17:08.394 --> 17:09.627
is the better actor.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.296
(others murmuring in agreement)

17:11.363 --> 17:13.632
{\an3}Patrick Stewart is
classically trained.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.634
{\an3}He's a member of the
Royal Shakespeare Company.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.103
He's too subtle. When William
Shatner plays an emotion,

17:18.170 --> 17:19.738
my shoe can tell what it is.

17:19.805 --> 17:21.106
(murmuring, laughter)

17:21.173 --> 17:22.540
Well, if you like big acting,

17:22.608 --> 17:26.244
(with accent): have I got
a show for you, dear boy.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.084
And Kirk is a terrible captain.

17:32.151 --> 17:33.318
He always puts the ship
in danger.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.753
Picard would never do that.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.755
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess Picard

17:36.822 --> 17:38.757
{\an1}never got assimilated
by the Borg.

17:38.824 --> 17:41.226

17:46.165 --> 17:48.534

17:48.600 --> 17:51.770
I will admit,
Wesley Crusher is the worst.

17:51.837 --> 17:54.840
Now you're knocking Wil Wheaton.
He's the best part of the show.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.475
He's an annoying know-it-all.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.510
(scoffs) Yeah,
that's what makes him lovable.

17:58.577 --> 18:01.113

What the heck?

You think you can

18:28.574 --> 18:30.209
just wash me away?

18:30.275 --> 18:32.611
Yes, I used the gentle

Exploiting your Bible
study group,

18:36.181 --> 18:37.449
that was just the beginning.

18:37.516 --> 18:40.185
I wouldn't say I exploited them.

18:40.252 --> 18:42.788
Good, don't.
It'll be our little secret.

Mom, help. I can't get out.

18:49.194 --> 18:50.796
Missy!

Why are you sleeping?!

You should be selling!
