04:20.399 --> 04:22.000
You're the mortician.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.900
You're the one putting bodies
into coffins.

04:24.900 --> 04:27.000
So what, you have
a two-for-one sale?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.700
Who's the extra stiff?

04:29.700 --> 04:30.900
You don't want to say anything?
That's fine.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.900
I'll just shut down
the mortuary.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.800
Maybe I'll book you
on suspicion of murder.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.100
For all I know,
you killed the guy

04:36.100 --> 04:38.000
before you stuffed him
in the coffin.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.900
Lawyer.

05:04.600 --> 05:05.900
You're under arrest.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.500
Got to admit it's a pretty
clever way to dispose of a body.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.800
Who's going to look
under somebody else's tombstone?

05:10.800 --> 05:12.500
Well, it's not exactly
a new technique.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.900
In the 1920s, Joe Bonanno
used to dispose of his hits

05:15.900 --> 05:17.300
in a double-decker coffin.

05:17.300 --> 05:20.700
So what is this,
more research for your mob book?

05:20.700 --> 05:23.500
I hope you're not starting
to admire those thugs.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.000
I don't admire them.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.300
But I'm grateful.

05:27.300 --> 05:28.700
For what?

05:28.700 --> 05:31.000
Well, my, uh,
book is done.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.400
I have meetings with three
different publishers in L.A.,

05:33.400 --> 05:36.200
and I fly out the
day after tomorrow.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.200
I heard you were in here.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.200
Need any help?
Hmm?

05:47.200 --> 05:48.600
Not really.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.000
I've already collected trace
off the body,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.400
and I'm almost done
with the coffin here.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.200
Chaparral High
football coach, huh?

05:54.700 --> 05:56.700
Hey, by the way,
how much do I owe you?

05:56.700 --> 05:57.400
I don't know, Warrick.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.100
Don't worry about it.
Man, come on.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.800
I always pay my debts.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.000
This should cover it.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.200
What exactly about
the Chaparral High state champs

06:08.200 --> 06:09.200
reminded you to pay me?

06:09.200 --> 06:10.900
Football always reminds me of money.

06:10.900 --> 06:11.900
It's not football season.

06:11.900 --> 06:14.500
It's baseball,
but I don't bet baseball.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.000
Pure paycheck, baby.

06:28.700 --> 06:31.100
Hey, doc, you figure out
what killed this guy yet?

06:31.100 --> 06:35.100
Yeah, found some petechiae
consistent with suffocation.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.200
Yeah, this should do it.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.700
You okay?

06:52.100 --> 06:53.300
Yeah.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.400
I know this guy.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.300
Or I knew him.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.000
He was a P.I.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.700
You just saved yourself
some work.

07:00.700 --> 07:03.000
His prints
will be in the system.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.200
Thanks.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.700
Lenny Harper.

07:25.700 --> 07:29.200
We were in patrol together
20 some-odd years ago.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.400
Class cop.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.600
You sure we're talking
about the same guy?

07:33.600 --> 07:35.200
This guy's got a list
of complaints

07:35.200 --> 07:38.300
going up right until
about the day he retired...

07:38.300 --> 07:39.400
???

07:39.400 --> 07:41.600
Vegas was a different town
back then.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.500
You ruffled feathers,
you got the boot.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.700
But soliciting prostitutes,

07:46.700 --> 07:49.100
extorting businessmen,
insurance fraud.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.900
Kind of looks like he deserved
to get the boot.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.000
Lenny always said those
complaints were trumped up.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.500
This file doesn't change the way
we treat this case.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.800
Lenny was a cop.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.800
Cops are a priority.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.900
I want every man you got
on this.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.000
Either this guy is a neat freak

08:31.000 --> 08:33.200
or he's got one hell of a cleaning lady.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.500
Left his computer;
that helps.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.500
Hey, Nick?

08:45.500 --> 08:47.700
Is there a trash can
under that desk?

08:48.900 --> 08:49.800
Yeah.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.400
Is there a liner in it?

08:51.400 --> 08:53.500
Yeah. Why?

08:53.500 --> 08:56.300
There's no liner in this one.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.500
And the paper shredder's
been emptied.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.800
Looks like somebody cleaned up

09:00.800 --> 09:03.000
after they cleaned up.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.000
This car is clean
as a whistle.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.200
The floor mat's
still damp.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.100
I think it's just
been detailed.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.700
What if the killer used the victim's car

09:49.700 --> 09:51.900
to transport the body?

09:53.500 --> 09:57.400
He drives the victim's own vehicle
back to the funeral home,

09:57.400 --> 09:59.800
stuffs the body
in a double-decker coffin,

09:59.800 --> 10:03.800
hits a car wash,comes back,
cleans out the office...

10:03.800 --> 10:05.600
and leaves us the keys?

10:05.600 --> 10:07.200
It's pretty considerate.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.500
Or very smart.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.100
How did you get
this number?

11:11.100 --> 11:12.900
Is this some
kind of a joke?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.900
What the hell do you want?

11:16.300 --> 11:18.500
Should I bring
my own shovel?

11:44.400 --> 11:45.200
Hey.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.100
Hi.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.500
Get anything off that computer?

11:49.500 --> 11:51.800
No. Hard drive's
been wiped clean.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.000
What about the shredder?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.900
Nothing but a couple of strips
from a folder and a few receipts.

11:55.900 --> 11:59.300
But I got a court order
on Mr. Harper's email accounts.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.200
He had quite a few.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.900
One that handled
mostly family stuff.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.700
One that handled
new customers.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.000
And a work account.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.200
The work account had an
online back-up system.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.000
That's what I'm in now.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.500
So you've basically gotten verything

12:11.500 --> 12:13.000
that was on his computer?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I even have
stuff he erased.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.500
There's a file in here that you
might think is interesting.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.700
P.I.'s like to use a lot of
audio and visual surveillance.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.900
Insurance policy.

12:22.900 --> 12:26.000
This one was even taping
his own meetings.

12:26.000 --> 12:26.900
Really?

12:27.600 --> 12:30.000
It's March 17, 2008.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Meeting with Client #333.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.700
This was from inside
his Escalade, yesterday...

12:35.700 --> 12:37.100
She did it with a cop.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.500
I spit on her.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.300
She deserved what she got.

12:40.300 --> 12:43.100
That's as close to a confession
as you're gonna get.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.100
I'm gonna bury that guy, Lenny.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.600
I'm gonna bury him.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.800
Warrick couldn't
investigate Gedda himself,

12:49.800 --> 12:51.700
so he had the P.I.
do it for him.

12:51.700 --> 12:55.300
Archie tracked down thousands of photos,
sound byte files, videos.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.300
Everything's connected
to Lou Gedda.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.900
I think Gedda caught Harper
spying on him, killed him

12:59.900 --> 13:02.900
and had the mortician put the
body in the double-decker casket.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.300
This is Warrick Brown.
Leave your name and number.

13:06.300 --> 13:10.200
Warrick. Call me now!

13:12.400 --> 13:14.800
Anybody hears from him,
I want to know.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.900
You got it.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.400
Where the hell have you been?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.600
Grissom...

13:34.600 --> 13:36.200
I gotta talk to you.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.500
Where are you?

13:38.500 --> 13:39.300
Pigalle.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.300
What are you thinking?

13:40.300 --> 13:42.700
I don't know. I don't know.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.700
You don't... you don't
know what?

13:44.700 --> 13:45.700
I don't know what I did here.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.800
I don't know what happened.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.700
I just woke up and...
???

13:48.700 --> 13:49.400
Drop the gun.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.800
I don't know what's
going on here!

13:50.800 --> 13:52.600
Drop the gun!

13:52.600 --> 13:53.200
Warrick?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.400
Put ???

13:54.400 --> 13:54.900
Now.

13:54.900 --> 13:55.700
Warrick?

13:55.700 --> 13:58.500
I'm a CSI!
Drop the gun!

14:42.300 --> 14:43.700
Warrick?

14:47.200 --> 14:49.800
Grissom, I...

14:49.800 --> 14:51.900
I don't know what happened.

14:51.900 --> 14:54.900
Local merchant heard gunshots,
called 9-1-1.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.100
I responded code 3, with backup.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.700
There was no one else in the building.

14:58.700 --> 15:01.000
Thanks. Listen, uh...

15:01.000 --> 15:02.900
could you give us
just a minute?

15:08.200 --> 15:09.600
What happened?

15:14.200 --> 15:16.300
I don't know.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.900
My head is throbbing.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.600
Is that your gun?

15:22.600 --> 15:24.500
Yeah.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.600
Are those your cuffs?

15:27.600 --> 15:29.000
I guess so.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.800
We need to get you a lawyer.

15:37.000 --> 15:37.800
Grissom...

15:37.800 --> 15:40.700
Don't say another word.

15:40.700 --> 15:41.200
Jim

15:41.200 --> 15:42.200
Just get on your feet.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.600
listen to me.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.000
I don't know
what happened!

15:45.000 --> 15:46.800
It's for your own good.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.700
Keep your mouth shut
till we get to the station.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.200
You couldn't just let it go, huh?

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
Come on.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.300
The 419 went out
as officer involved. No details.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.700
Yeah, we got here
as quick as we could.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.200
What the hell happened?

17:16.200 --> 17:17.500
Gedda's dead.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.900
Put your kits away.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.800
Day Shift will be processing
the scene.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.700
I.A.'s taking the case
from here.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.200
Turn around.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.900
Hands up ??? GSR.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.000
Get a lawyer.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.500
I don't want one.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.200
This isn't going away, Warrick.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.500
In 48 hours, they're gonna
charge you.

18:11.500 --> 18:15.700
I wouldn't know what to
tell a lawyer, anyway.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.700
I'm gonna have to
take your clothes.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.300
Were you just
talking to I.A.?

18:49.300 --> 18:50.300
Yes.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.900
And what'd you tell 'em?

18:51.900 --> 18:53.100
I'm not supposed to talk about it;

18:53.100 --> 18:54.000
I signed an admonishment.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.300
I don't care.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.700
What'd you say?

18:58.500 --> 19:00.600
I said that I saw Warrick
sitting alone

19:00.600 --> 19:03.000
in Grissom's office
in the dark.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.100
So what?

19:04.100 --> 19:05.700
So, he got a phone call,

19:05.700 --> 19:09.000
and he got really pissed
at the person he was talking to.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.600
So what?

19:10.600 --> 19:13.100
Then he was found an hour later
in a pool of Gedda's blood.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.200
You don't know what
happened in there.

19:15.200 --> 19:19.600
Look, Nick, all I did was
tell the truth as I saw it.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.500
That's what we're
supposed to do. Right?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.100
I don't remember what happened.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.900
Is that what you're
going with? Really?

19:34.900 --> 19:36.900
That's what the truth is.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.500
Okay.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.900
Uh, for the record then,

19:40.900 --> 19:43.600
are you claiming memory loss
from a possible concussion,

19:43.600 --> 19:48.000
or hysterical amnesia
following a traumatic incident?

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Like I told you, I just don't
remember what happened.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
You remember hiring Lenny Harper
to investigate Lou Gedda...

19:56.000 --> 19:58.900
in violation
of direct orders?

19:58.900 --> 20:01.200
Yeah.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.200
You think Gedda was responsible?

20:03.200 --> 20:04.800
I'd bet on it.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.600
I've heard that about you.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.100
Is that why you went to Pigalle?

20:09.100 --> 20:12.000
I went to Pigalle
because Lou Gedda called me.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.000
Your coworkers
corroborate a call,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.100
so we pulled
your cell records.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.300
It came from a disposable phone,

20:19.300 --> 20:20.600
which means it could've come
from anybody.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.300
No, it came from Lou Gedda.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.900
I suppose that's possible.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.000
But we do seem to be jogging
your memory.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.800
Let's keep that ball rolling.
What happened next?

20:29.800 --> 20:31.400
I went down there.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.100
Alone?

20:33.100 --> 20:34.100
Yes.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.500
Unarmed?

20:38.100 --> 20:39.500
No.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.100
Gedda!

20:44.600 --> 20:46.300
You called me!

20:46.300 --> 20:48.600
Next thing I remember...

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
I don't remember anything
that happened after that.

21:31.800 --> 21:36.000
Uh, you left out
the best part.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
But I guess
that's the...

21:38.000 --> 21:39.500
amnesia.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.100
You want me to fill in
the blank?

21:42.100 --> 21:43.900
Your gun...

21:43.900 --> 21:45.800
with blood, tissue and hair
at the scene.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.700
Your handcuffs on the vic.

21:48.700 --> 21:49.900
You...

21:49.900 --> 21:51.700
covered in blood.

21:51.700 --> 21:54.400
You went to Pigalle to get revenge

21:54.400 --> 21:57.300
by giving Lou Gedda
a taste of his own medicine.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.600
You're a CSI.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.500
What's the evidence telling you?

22:25.500 --> 22:30.000
The evidence is...

22:30.000 --> 22:34.700
...the evidence is suggesting
that I did it.

22:34.700 --> 22:36.200
Okay.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.500
You think this is some
kind of a joke, eh?

22:38.500 --> 22:39.600
You think this is a joke,
right?

22:39.600 --> 22:41.100
You're making a mistake. Sit down.

22:41.100 --> 22:42.100
I don't know what happened.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.100
You're digging a hole.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.700
You understand
what I'm saying?!

22:44.700 --> 22:45.900
I don't knowwhat happened!

22:45.900 --> 22:47.400
???

23:00.000 --> 23:01.600
Okay, the rods are in place

23:01.600 --> 23:03.600
according to the autopsy report.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.300
Conrad.

23:06.300 --> 23:09.000
Gil, we're processing
Warrick's case evidence.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.200
You shouldn't even
be in here.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.200
I'd like to see the files.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.100
Well, they're
not done yet.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.400
We're still finalizing
our conclusions.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.300
Yeah, but if I could see
the raw test data,

23:17.300 --> 23:19.400
I could draw my own conclusions.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.000
I'll get you copies
of the reports.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.500
You'll have them
in a couple of hours.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.800
Thanks.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.200
Well ???

23:37.000 --> 23:38.800
Excuse me, Detective.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.300
May I have a few minutes
with CSI Brown?

23:41.300 --> 23:42.800
Why?

23:42.800 --> 23:44.400
I'm a friend.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.400
Well, he sure needs
one of those.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.900
Be my guest.
Thank you.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.100
How you holding up?

23:58.100 --> 23:59.100
Hmm.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.300
That depends.

24:05.500 --> 24:09.100
Do you think I did it?

24:09.100 --> 24:12.000
I can't discuss the case.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.100
Yeah.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.200
I don't know, I think
I'd just feel a lot better

24:17.200 --> 24:19.000
if I had a change
of clothes.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.900
I hate being dressed
like a convict.

24:21.900 --> 24:24.700
I'll take care of it.

24:24.700 --> 24:25.900
Stay strong.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.600
We're not
through yet.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.900
Okay, um...

24:40.900 --> 24:43.400
Let's... let's back
up a little bit.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.600
You get involved with
a pretty young thing.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.800
You go away to do
your business.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.600
She winds up dead.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.500
You ever think about that?

24:52.500 --> 24:54.900
I think about Joanna
every day.

24:54.900 --> 24:57.900
There's not a day that goes
by I don't think about her.

24:57.900 --> 24:59.100
No, I'm sorry.

24:59.100 --> 25:02.500
I was talking
about Holly Gribbs.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.300
You remember
Holly, don't you?

25:05.300 --> 25:08.500
Rookie CSI you left alone
at a crime scene eight years ago

25:08.500 --> 25:10.900
to go place bets
for a crooked judge.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.900
Suspect came back and shot her.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.200
I remember.

25:14.200 --> 25:18.200
Poor innocent girl just trying
to do her job.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.500
She winds up dead
because of you.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.900
That has nothing
to do with this.

25:20.900 --> 25:22.200
Do two points make
a straight line?

25:22.200 --> 25:25.400
It's a pattern of behavior.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.700
Reckless, obsessive,

25:26.700 --> 25:30.500
compulsive, self-destructive
behavior.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.500
What are you
doing here?

25:52.900 --> 25:56.800
I just stopped by to get Warrick
a change of clothes.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.500
All right, take something
out of the drawers-

25:58.500 --> 26:01.700
nothing laid out or in the laundry.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.600
You get Holly killed,

26:03.600 --> 26:04.900
then you get Joanna killed.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.600
You just can't take
any more, so you kill Gedda.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.200
That's how a jury's
going to see it.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.300
There's nothing I can do
about that.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.200
Sure there is.

26:13.200 --> 26:17.000
Look, Lou Gedda was a slimeball.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.800
That's common
knowledge.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.500
Nobody's going
to miss him.

26:20.500 --> 26:23.800
In fact, the world is arguably
a better place without him.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.300
And so if I just
admit to killing him,

26:25.300 --> 26:26.400
they'll take it easy on me,

26:26.400 --> 26:28.600
and you're just trying to help
me out, right?

26:28.600 --> 26:31.500
You know how many times
I used that on a suspect?

26:31.500 --> 26:33.200
Don't waste your game, pal.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.400
Okay.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.400
You...You're a betting man.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.700
Given the circumstances,

26:37.700 --> 26:40.100
what do you think your odds
are right now?

26:42.500 --> 26:44.400
I want a lawyer.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.800
There were numerous
high-velocity blood stains

26:50.800 --> 26:54.100
on the front of CSI
Warrick Brown's shirt.

26:54.100 --> 26:59.000
Seven of these stains were
typed using 13 STR loci.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.700
All samples match blood collected
from Lou Gedda at autopsy...

27:03.600 --> 27:07.600
The five expended cartridge cases
recovered at Pigalle Boulevard

27:07.600 --> 27:11.300
were all fired in Warrick
Brown's service pistol...

27:14.600 --> 27:16.300
The bullets recovered
at autopsy

27:16.300 --> 27:18.000
and from the barber's chair

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
were fired from the same gun, as well...

27:22.800 --> 27:25.800
Based on the clotting
of the facial lacerations

27:25.800 --> 27:29.300
and development of the bruises
on the victim's arms and wrists...

27:29.300 --> 27:33.300
it appears he was bound and beaten
at least an hour prior to death...

27:34.900 --> 27:38.300
Okay, if this were
any other suspect,

27:38.300 --> 27:40.300
what would be our conclusion?

27:46.500 --> 27:47.500
That he did it.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.600
Which is what Warrick told
Internal Affairs.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.700
He confessed?

27:50.700 --> 27:54.000
No, but he didn't deny it.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.500
He says he can't remember.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.900
That We've all heard that one before.

27:57.900 --> 27:59.400
What's that supposed to mean?

27:59.400 --> 28:00.700
It's not supposed
to mean anything.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.900
We're just talking.

28:02.900 --> 28:05.300
We can't just sit her
and watch him go down.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.800
We're not going to.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.900
He's asked for an attorney.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.400
We'll get him a shark.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.300
The only thing
the jury's going to see

28:12.300 --> 28:15.000
is a rogue cop with a vendetta.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.900
I've been there before.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.800
They're going to crucify him.

28:19.500 --> 28:20.500
Hey, guys, I'm sorry
to interrupt,

28:20.500 --> 28:21.800
but you need
to see this.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.800
There was chloroform in Lou
Gedda's blood and tissue.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.300
Chloroform gets metabolized
in the body pretty quickly,

28:27.300 --> 28:29.400
and it's excreted by breathing.

28:29.400 --> 28:32.800
So Gedda must have been killed
soon after he was dosed.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.600
Warrick went in there
with a gun.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.000
Why would he use chloroform
if he was going to shoot him?

28:38.000 --> 28:41.300
Maybe to subdue him
into the barber's chair.

28:41.300 --> 28:42.900
So he intended to torture him?

28:42.900 --> 28:46.100
No, not Warrick. No way.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.800
You know, chloroform
exposure can result

28:48.800 --> 28:51.200
in short term amnesia.

28:51.200 --> 28:51.700
Warrick says

28:51.700 --> 28:55.600
he can't remember anything
after going into Gedda's office.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.300
Where's the tox on Warrick?

28:57.300 --> 28:58.600
His blood wasn't drawn.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.500
Why not?

28:59.500 --> 29:02.400
The arrest report didn't note
any intoxication at the scene.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.500
I guess nobody saw
any reason to do it.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.200
Well, now there's a reason.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.700
Here, put this on.

29:15.700 --> 29:16.700
Okay.

29:18.500 --> 29:21.400
Henry did a comprehensive
drug test for chloroform,

29:21.400 --> 29:24.600
along with a head space run
for volatiles and solvents.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.300
Everything came back negative.

29:27.300 --> 29:28.900
Half-life of chloroform
in a human being

29:28.900 --> 29:31.400
is about 1.5 hours.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.800
It's virtually undetectable
in seven to ten hours.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.900
We drew the blood too late.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.300
It's still possible
Warrick was dosed.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.900
We just can't prove it.

29:39.900 --> 29:40.800
Nick, come here.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.600
Take a look at his shirt.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.500
See the voids in
the blood spatter

29:46.500 --> 29:48.300
around the armpits.

29:48.300 --> 29:50.300
Fabric must have been folded 

29:50.300 --> 29:51.700
when the blood
was deposited.

29:51.700 --> 29:53.600
Looks like he had
something under his arms.

29:53.600 --> 29:54.800
Mm-hmm.

29:55.900 --> 29:58.900
Grab Hodges from behind-
under the armpits.

29:58.900 --> 30:00.000
Turn around.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.100
Dead weight, Hodges.
Slump down.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.800
Let him
hold you up.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.000
Okay, Nick...

30:05.000 --> 30:05.600
Raise his right arm.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.400
Pretend he's got
a gun in his hand.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.600
It's possible.

30:13.600 --> 30:17.000
I mean, if Warrick were unconscious
or semiconscious,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.100
he would have had
to have been supported.

30:19.100 --> 30:21.800
Well, based on the high-velocity
spatter on the shirt,

30:21.800 --> 30:24.700
the shooter would have
had to be within three feet of Gedda

30:24.700 --> 30:26.000
when he fired.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.200
Take off the shirt.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.400
Thanks.

30:44.900 --> 30:47.200
Similar void
in the spatter pattern.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.500
It's consistent,
but not conclusive.

30:54.500 --> 30:58.000
There's probably a dozen different
ways to explain those voids.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.700
Doesn't rule Warrick out
as the shooter.

30:59.700 --> 31:03.200
But it gives an alternative
explanation of the evidence.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.200
And if we're right...

31:05.200 --> 31:06.900
Warrick was framed.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.900
I talked to a detective
at organized crime.

31:11.900 --> 31:13.600
He's sending over a
list of all the people

31:13.600 --> 31:15.600
that wanted Gedda dead.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.200
It's a long list.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.000
Cross-reference it to any
of Warrick's convictions

31:19.000 --> 31:20.100
who might have it
out for him.

31:20.100 --> 31:22.700
Maybe somebody's trying to
kill two birds with one stone.

31:22.700 --> 31:23.800
Okay, I'm on it.

31:23.800 --> 31:24.900
Hey.

31:24.900 --> 31:27.000
Any unknown contributors
from the blood at the scene?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.300
No. They're all coming
back to the vic.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.400
Wendy and I are working
as fast as we can.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.300
We're striking out.

31:44.300 --> 31:45.600
There's no new evidence
from the scene

31:45.600 --> 31:48.500
that points to any
additional suspects.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.900
You got something?

31:53.600 --> 31:54.800
Handcuffs?

31:54.800 --> 31:57.600
Take a look
at the ligature marks.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.100
The width of the rails
on Warrick's cuffs

32:00.100 --> 32:02.700
are three millimeters narrower

32:02.700 --> 32:04.900
than the ligature marks.

32:04.900 --> 32:08.800
The ligature marks on Gedda didn't
come from Warrick's cuffs.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.600
So somebody switched
the handcuffs

32:14.600 --> 32:16.200
after Gedda was dead?

32:16.200 --> 32:18.300
Brass always suspected
that there was a mole

32:18.300 --> 32:20.600
in the department
that worked for Gedda.

32:21.900 --> 32:24.600
I bet we're looking
for a cop.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.800
A P.I. investigating Gedda
gets killed...

32:27.800 --> 32:30.800
then Gedda gets killed...

32:30.800 --> 32:32.700
Maybe this dirty cop
did them both.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.400
Yeah, but we can't prove it,

32:34.400 --> 32:37.300
'cause we're not allowed
to investigate Gedda's murder.

32:37.300 --> 32:39.300
We're still investigating
the P.I.

32:39.300 --> 32:41.500
If the cases are linked,

32:41.500 --> 32:45.800
we solve one,
we solve the other.

32:47.900 --> 32:50.000
Do your client and this
department a favor-

32:50.000 --> 32:51.800
make a deal.

32:51.800 --> 32:56.200
The district attorney said
he might consider manslaughter.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.200
I can't do that.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.600
Are you telling me
you're innocent?

33:00.600 --> 33:03.500
Because I.A. said those words
never crossed your lips.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.900
Are you charging me?

33:05.900 --> 33:08.200
Not yet.

33:08.200 --> 33:11.300
But in about five hours, it's
gonna be first-degree murder.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.400
We got the link.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.100
Tox confirmed
traces of chloroform

33:17.100 --> 33:18.900
in the P.I.'s body.

33:18.900 --> 33:21.000
Had to have been the same
guy who killed Gedda.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.200
Well, that helps.

33:23.200 --> 33:23.900
Okay.

33:23.900 --> 33:27.200
We got evidence logs and police files
from both scenes,

33:27.200 --> 33:30.900
but if a cop left trace
at either murder scene,

33:30.900 --> 33:31.900
we'd just write it off

33:31.900 --> 33:35.100
to normal investigator
contamination.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.300
Yeah.

33:36.300 --> 33:37.300
After he killed his victims,

33:37.300 --> 33:39.300
he could've even stayed
and handled the scene,

33:39.300 --> 33:41.700
made sure that he
hadn't missed anything.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Day Shift found prints

33:46.000 --> 33:48.700
from three officers
at Gedda's office.

33:48.700 --> 33:51.600
Well, all three were
assigned to the scene.

33:51.600 --> 33:54.000
Mandy I.D.'d fingerprints

33:54.000 --> 33:56.900
from five officers at the mortuary.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.600
Okay, but only four
signed the log.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.400
The unexplained print...

34:04.400 --> 34:07.600
belongs to...

34:07.600 --> 34:09.400
Officer Daniel Pritchard.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.100
His fingerprint was found...
on the casket.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.000
How does his fingerprint

34:20.000 --> 34:23.300
get on the casket if he wasn't
at the mortuary?

34:23.600 --> 34:24.699
I'm sorry, Captain.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.699
No one's seen Pritchard
since day before yesterday.

34:26.699 --> 34:27.800
Open it.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.699
No cuffs.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.400
Maybe we don't need them.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.800
So it's all on Pritchard.

35:27.700 --> 35:29.700
Is this gonna
hold up in court?

35:29.700 --> 35:30.800
It will.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.700
You know what the defense
is gonna say, right?

35:33.700 --> 35:37.000
who better than a CSI to make
a murder look like a frame?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.400
He was framed.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.000
And I'll prove it.

35:51.100 --> 35:53.700
Listen, Grissom, um...

35:53.700 --> 35:57.200
I'm so sorry
about all this.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.300
Warrick.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Yeah.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.300
You were framed.

36:05.300 --> 36:06.400
Framed?

36:12.300 --> 36:14.300
By who?

36:14.300 --> 36:16.800
Gedda has a mole
in the department.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.200
I'm ready to talk.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.500
He's on the way.

36:26.500 --> 36:27.600
Gedda!

36:28.200 --> 36:30.200
You called me?

36:41.000 --> 36:42.400
A cop?

36:42.400 --> 36:44.400
Daniel Pritchard.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.000
We think that
he had him kill Lenny Harper,

36:48.000 --> 36:51.100
Probably Joanna Krumsky,
as well.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.100
Then why would
he kill Gedda?

36:53.100 --> 36:54.600
Who knows?

36:54.600 --> 36:56.800
Old mobsters... crooked cops.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.500
It's a long history.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.400
I don't know. I mean...

37:00.400 --> 37:01.700
Come on, Grissom.

37:01.700 --> 37:06.500
Gedda's been killing
and barbecuing people for 25 years.

37:06.500 --> 37:11.100
It'd take more than a beat cop
to get over on that fat bastard.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.300
There's got to be somebody
higher up than that.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.500
Probably.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.600
But Pritchard's
all we got for now.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.800
He's in custody?

37:18.800 --> 37:20.000
Not yet.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Hey, everything can't
go our way.

37:24.300 --> 37:26.300
The D.A.'s gonna
drop the charges.

37:28.900 --> 37:32.300
But there's still the question
of administrative violations.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.100
So Ecklie and I are recommending
to the undersheriff

37:36.100 --> 37:40.600
that you be suspended
and demoted but not terminated.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.200
I still have a job?

37:43.200 --> 37:44.400
Well...

37:44.400 --> 37:47.800
the undersheriff says he
has to think about it,

37:47.800 --> 37:49.900
but he just wants
to make you sweat.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.800
I've sweated enough, man.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.100
I imagine.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.000
Thank you.

38:05.900 --> 38:07.500
Thanks.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.800
Thank you.

38:11.400 --> 38:13.100
Come on.

38:13.100 --> 38:15.500
Brass is gonna
process you out.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.900
Thanks, Jim.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.400
Don't ever forget
how lucky you are.

38:35.300 --> 38:36.500
Let's go.

38:49.400 --> 38:52.100
But at least mine was with
Lana Turner, not Aaron Spelling.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.100
That's pretty lame, I know.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.200
This just reminds me,

38:59.200 --> 39:01.100
what does it take
to get

39:01.100 --> 39:03.900
them to serve turkey bacon
in this place?

39:03.900 --> 39:06.000
Turkey bacon's not gonna make
the food any better here.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.700
Yeah, well, fortunately
we don't come here for the food.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.200
No.

39:10.200 --> 39:14.100
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
there's no place I'd rather be.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.500
Aw...

39:22.400 --> 39:24.400
Anything else?

39:24.400 --> 39:26.300
See you next time?
Yeah.

39:26.300 --> 39:27.500
Thanks.

39:30.800 --> 39:31.800
You still there?

39:31.800 --> 39:32.200
Hmm?

39:32.200 --> 39:33.700
This one right here.

39:34.300 --> 39:35.800
I'll take this.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.400
Well, thank you, Warrick.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.100
Thank you.

39:44.500 --> 39:45.800
Okay.

39:45.800 --> 39:46.800
I'm going home.

39:46.800 --> 39:47.700
Yeah, me, too.

39:47.700 --> 39:49.100
Get some sleep tonight.

39:49.100 --> 39:50.300
Oh, yeah.

39:51.500 --> 39:52.400
Thanks for breakfast.

39:52.400 --> 39:52.800
You got it, man.

39:52.800 --> 39:53.600
???

39:53.600 --> 39:54.900
See you at the lab.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.000
If you ever need anybody
to talk to,

40:02.000 --> 40:03.700
you know how to get a hold of me, huh?

40:03.700 --> 40:05.000
Yeah.

40:05.000 --> 40:05.900
Thanks.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.900
Well...

40:20.900 --> 40:23.000
it's just you and me, Serpico.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.000
Let's get a beer.

40:25.000 --> 40:25.800
Oh, no.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.400
Come on. You're
a free man now.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.200
This free man needs
a free shower.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.500
I think, uh...

40:30.500 --> 40:31.700
you need to, uh... 

40:31.700 --> 40:34.100
take a hard look at that redhead.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.400
You know, I might
just do that.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.300
Yeah. You need to.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.100
Hey.

40:40.100 --> 40:43.500
I'm really glad you're okay.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.600
Thanks.

40:46.300 --> 40:47.100
I'll call you later.

40:47.100 --> 40:47.900
All right.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.400
Warrick.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.200
I wanted to join you for dinner.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.300
I'm sorry we missed you.

41:40.300 --> 41:42.000
Yeah, well.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.500
I just wanted to congratulate
you in person.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.400
You sure made a believer out of me.

41:46.400 --> 41:48.100
Thanks.

41:48.100 --> 41:53.000
Look, uh...
I don't want to fire you.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I just need to know that you're
through running the streets

41:55.000 --> 41:57.400
on your own
looking for bad guys.

41:57.400 --> 41:59.500
Look...

41:59.500 --> 42:03.900
I'm done being a rogue
in the streets, you know?

42:03.900 --> 42:04.600
But there's...

42:04.600 --> 42:08.600
there's one son of a bitch
still out there.

42:08.600 --> 42:11.300
And I promise you,
we're gonna get him.

42:11.300 --> 42:14.300
Well... Grissom taught you well.

42:14.300 --> 42:17.100
I like to think so.

42:17.100 --> 42:19.000
You never give up.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.200
No.

42:23.400 --> 42:26.400
That's what makes you
a great CSI.
