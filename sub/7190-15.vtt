Emma, it's okay.
Just me, Daniel.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.432
Can it--she even understand me?

Emma, can you understand me?

Good.

- Your face.

It's--
well, not purple anymore.

- It's red.

02:12.131 --> 02:14.634

02:14.717 --> 02:15.885
because Emma's a parrot.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.388
- [gasps] How dare you
call Emma a parrot.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.557
Is it because she talks a lot?
'Cause she does.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.892
But I mean it's not nice
to point things out like that.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.728
Do I ever point out that
you have a gigantic forehead?

02:25.812 --> 02:29.399
- No, I mean she turned
herself into a parrot

02:29.482 --> 02:32.068
with a spell.
Accidentally, I think.

02:32.151 --> 02:33.653
- Wait, what?
- I saw it.

02:33.736 --> 02:36.531
The T3 rigged her locker,
and I don't have a big forehead.

02:36.614 --> 02:37.699

Look, I apologize for calling
you Franken-boy,

02:40.577 --> 02:42.078

There's a storm coming.

- I know, Miss Information
won't stop talking about it.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.042
- We have to find Emma

02:48.126 --> 02:49.669
and change her back
before--

02:49.752 --> 02:50.670
before somebody realizes
she's missing.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.589
- Well, I mean,
we can look for her,

02:52.672 --> 02:54.757
but neither one of us
can change her back.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.426
- That's why we
have to find Lily.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.511
- Well, Lily's at
the Council, she's--

02:58.595 --> 03:01.598
- I know, she gave you
a phone for emergencies.

03:01.681 --> 03:02.765
Yeah, Emma told me.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.809
- Look, I don't want
Emma to get in trouble.

03:04.893 --> 03:05.226
- You'd rather her be a parrot?

03:07.186 --> 03:08.563
Andi!
- Ah, calm down.

03:08.646 --> 03:12.275
We're gonna find her,
it's just--a little parrot

would have been cool, too.

broke up.

Andi?
Daniel?

03:44.515 --> 03:45.224
What's going on?

03:45.308 --> 03:47.560
- This is a mega emergency.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.978
- Spoiler alert.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.813
- Emma accidentally
turned herself into a parrot.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.316
- What?
How?

03:53.399 --> 03:55.193
- All I saw was Emma
being, well...

03:55.276 --> 03:59.072
attacked by water guns
filled with soda.

03:59.155 --> 04:02.200
She cast a spell, it bounced off
a mirror and it hit her instead

04:02.283 --> 04:03.826
and turned her into a parrot.

04:03.910 --> 04:04.702
- Wow, I don't know which
part of that sentence

04:04.786 --> 04:07.038
was the weirdest.

04:07.121 --> 04:09.248
- When did this happen?
- Just a few minutes ago.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.458
- So go out and find her.

04:10.541 --> 04:11.834
She couldn't have
gotten too far.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.670
And even though she's a parrot,
she's still Emma.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.838
So try places

04:15.922 --> 04:17.589
Emma the human might go.
- Okay.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.300
- Then bring her back here.
- Okay.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.593
- And the <i>Hex.</i>
- Okay.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.220
- And someone who can
cast a reversal spell.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.430
- Can I get you anything else?
A sandwich, a soda?

04:24.514 --> 04:27.600

- Okay, okay, we're on it.

high-tech weather printouts,

How does a powerless
witch teletransport?

07:01.254 --> 07:02.672
Answer?
She doesn't.

07:02.755 --> 07:08.845
Unless something or someone
magical summons her.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.347
- [sighs] Right before
I joined the Council,

07:11.430 --> 07:13.182
I gave Emma a magic mobile phone

07:13.266 --> 07:15.768
so she could call
in case she had any problems.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.353

07:17.436 --> 07:19.480
You have been undermining my
time with Emma, haven't you?

07:19.564 --> 07:21.274

Why would I undermine you?

07:24.610 --> 07:28.364

I been telling you?

07:28.447 --> 07:30.533
She is not Council material.

07:30.616 --> 07:36.289
And she lied to us the entire
time about that phone and...

07:36.372 --> 07:37.540
who knows what else.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.211
- You're not suggesting
that Lily had something

07:42.295 --> 07:45.047
to do with this?
- Yes.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.049
- But she has no powers.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.801
She'd be a fool to try it.

she's not a fool?

Where's Andi?

08:05.401 --> 08:06.569
You called me?

08:06.652 --> 08:09.864
- I'm sorry,
but Andi found Emma.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.157
We need you.
- Oh.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.742

what you're doing for Emma.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.833
I know you're upset with her.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.835
- Yeah, well, just 'cause
I'm mad at her doesn't mean

08:22.919 --> 08:24.420
she has to get stuck
being a parrot.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.631
- Look, I know Emma lied
to you, but she's been under

08:26.714 --> 08:30.301
so much pressure lately.
A lot of it from me.

08:30.384 --> 08:31.344
- What do you mean?

08:31.427 --> 08:33.346
- A few weeks ago, we--

08:33.429 --> 08:38.558
the Witches Council told Emma
she had to break up with you

08:38.643 --> 08:41.812
or we would take
her powers away.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.357
[device clatters]

08:44.440 --> 08:46.776
- It's a huge risk for a witch
to be dating a human,

08:46.859 --> 08:48.861
especially the Chosen One.

08:48.945 --> 08:53.699
If the magic realm got exposed,
it could be a total disaster.

08:53.783 --> 08:57.161
- So she was gonna break
up with me this whole time?

08:57.245 --> 09:00.873
- No, she was going to
give up her powers...

09:00.957 --> 09:02.458
for you.
- She was?

09:02.541 --> 09:03.876
- Daniel!
I got her, I got her!

09:03.960 --> 09:05.753

Is her beak not pointy enough?

Of course it doesn't
look like Emma!

It's a parrot!

09:17.848 --> 09:20.101
- I know,
I just don't think it's her.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.895
- Well, it's got to be her.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.355
She was over by the dock.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.564
And isn't that like your place?

09:27.900 --> 09:29.986
Yeah, Emma tells me things, too.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.445
- She's right, Daniel.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.321
I mean, how many parrots on
the loose can there be

in Miami at the same time?

09:34.865 --> 09:36.951
- Yeah, this is Emma,
and I found her.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.662
- Okay.
We've got Emma.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.539
Now we just need a witch.

- You're a witch.
- Don't go there.

away like a coward.

I'll show you the spell.

And you,
stop insulting him.

wouldn't find the real Sophie

10:30.129 --> 10:32.006
and find out you were lying?

10:32.089 --> 10:34.008
- Oh, I locked her
in the janitor's closet.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.676
- You what?
- Don't freak.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.386
She thinks we're
playing hide-and-seek.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.513
- We're ready.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.681
- Hold on, Sophie.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.141
- Are you sure you
know how to do this?

10:42.224 --> 10:43.934
- Absolutely.
I've accidentally

10:44.018 --> 10:46.645
turned Sophie
into a parrot many times.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.522
- Maddie, go ahead.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.108
- You better not mess up.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.194
- This bird isn't a parrot
to me,

10:53.277 --> 10:55.279
back to a person
you shall now be.

11:01.619 --> 11:05.664
- Th[bird caws]phie!
- T- No, wait.mma!

11:05.748 --> 11:08.084
Find Emma!
- I told you that wasn't Emma.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.585
- Wait, why do you
guys keep saying Emma?

11:09.668 --> 11:12.254
Was that parrot
supposed to be Emma?

11:12.338 --> 11:13.923
- Oh, yes, it was.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.299
Emma turned herself
into a parrot,

11:15.383 --> 11:17.385
and we need to find her
before the storm hits.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.845
- And she's the Chosen One?

11:19.929 --> 11:21.972
- Andi, she's still out there.
We're running out of time.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.182
- Where's Sophie?

11:23.265 --> 11:25.101
- She's--
- Wait, don't tell her.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.685
Sophie's the only
leverage we have.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.730
- Tag, you're it.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.817
- [laughs] Guess you
lost your leverage.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.276
Come on, Soph, let's go.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.570
Good luck with
your parrot problem.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.325
- What now?

11:41.409 --> 11:42.993
- Well, there's
a locater spell in the <i>Hex.</i>

11:43.077 --> 11:46.455
It almost never works but,
hey, it's worth a shot.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.416
- We should have
tried that first.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.292
- Yeah, well,
hindsight is 20/20.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.794
Look, you go make sure Maddie

11:51.877 --> 11:53.671
turns birdie back into
a parrot,

11:53.754 --> 11:54.797
and I'll go get Jax.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.799
- Jax?
Why?

11:56.882 --> 11:58.134
- Don't go getting
all jealous and stuff.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.136
Look, I'll explain
everything later, I promise.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.680
- You sure will.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.223
Let's meet at my house.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.433
My parents and the T3
aren't going to be home.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.309
They've got
a parent-teacher conference,

12:07.393 --> 12:08.727
and that's usually
an all-nighter.

12:12.189 --> 12:13.858
- Hey, Maddie!

12:15.734 --> 12:18.696
- Yeah, definitely more
ripe berry than magenta.

12:18.779 --> 12:21.157
- What's wrong with your face?
- Uh, nothing.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.452
- Her face?
It's like one giant mood ring.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.413
- Sophie!
- She's right.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.290
Sophie's right.
- I am?

12:29.373 --> 12:31.667
- Can't you see?

12:31.750 --> 12:34.920
You're wearing your emotions
on your face, literally.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.922
- Katie!
- What?

12:37.006 --> 12:38.841
- That's it.
Purple when you're mad.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.301
Green when you're jealous.
And--

12:40.384 --> 12:42.094
- What color does it
turn when I'm around?

12:42.178 --> 12:44.096
- None!
Get out!

12:44.180 --> 12:45.973
- I knew it!
You have feelings for me.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.309
- No, I don't.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.562
- He's gone.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.816
- He is?
- Uh-oh.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.194
- What?
What color is it?

12:58.277 --> 12:59.862
- Blue.
- No!

13:06.452 --> 13:07.536
- Emma needs your help.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.621
- Then why doesn't
she ask me herself?

13:08.704 --> 13:10.873
- Well, that's the thing.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.167
She, uh, turned
herself into an animal.

13:13.250 --> 13:17.963
- [laughs] Oh, Emma,
she's such a klutz sometimes.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.548
She's so cute.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.383
Anyway, what did she
turn herself into?

13:21.467 --> 13:23.928
Cat, dog, monkey?

13:24.011 --> 13:25.429
- Parrot.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.056
- Uh, I just remembered,

13:27.139 --> 13:29.183
I've got something
really important to do.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.726
- But, what?

13:30.809 --> 13:32.561
More important than saving
Emma from being a bird?

13:34.188 --> 13:35.898
You're scared of birds,
aren't you?

13:35.981 --> 13:36.941
- No, that's ridiculous.

13:37.024 --> 13:42.404
Who's afraid of
[stammering] birds?

13:43.572 --> 13:44.949
Like I said, I've gotta go.

13:45.032 --> 13:45.950
- Wait, not so fast.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.499
- What?
Why is he--

13:53.582 --> 13:55.834
- It's nothing.
- He's got a thing about birds.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.670
- It's a phobia.
I can't help it.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.506
- There are birds everywhere.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.424
- It's just when
they're inside.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.425
It's just--it's not right.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.636
It freaks me out.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.595
- So did you bring
the other witch?

14:06.679 --> 14:09.682
- Huh?
- The other witch?

14:09.765 --> 14:10.766
Who's gonna turn Emma
back into a person?

14:10.849 --> 14:14.144
- Uh, Daniel,
he is the other witch.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.647
- Wizard, ugh!

14:16.730 --> 14:20.317
- You're a--you have
magic powers, too?

14:20.401 --> 14:21.694
- Oh, sorry,
did I forget to mention that

14:21.777 --> 14:23.070
on my Sharks' application?

14:23.153 --> 14:28.158
- This is--I can't
even--just forget it.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.785
Let's just do this
so we can save Emma

14:29.868 --> 14:31.495
and all go our separate ways.

14:33.497 --> 14:36.417
Now cast a locater
spell and summon Emma here.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.085
- Person form or--

14:38.168 --> 14:39.169
- Parrot form.

14:42.464 --> 14:45.050
- Wherever she is
far or near,

14:45.134 --> 14:48.470
summon Emma right here.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.308
- Hey, it worked.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.643
- [groans]

14:56.353 --> 14:58.981
- Diego has a really
bad effect on your face.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.984
You should probably
stop hanging out with him.

15:02.067 --> 15:05.738
- Or figure out how to stop
my face from changing colors.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.656
- Mm, I think my plan
is better, because you know--

15:07.740 --> 15:08.532
- Emma must have done this.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.785
She put a spell on me.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.872
- I thought you said
she turned into a...

15:14.955 --> 15:16.582
bird.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.709
- Before that.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.003
- She probably turned herself
into a parrot

15:21.086 --> 15:21.837
so she could hide from me.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.883
Oh, she is going
to pay for this!

15:32.848 --> 15:35.851
- I'm still upset
that you lied to me, Emma.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.436
Though after what Lily told me,

15:37.519 --> 15:38.937
I'm starting to understand
why you did.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.485
I don't want you to
lose your powers for me.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.028
You're the Chosen One.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.656
I don't know exactly what
that means but--

15:48.739 --> 15:51.700
Jax, wake up!
- [gasping]

15:51.784 --> 15:55.245
Um, yeah,
I'm fine, I'm good.

15:55.329 --> 15:59.917
- Good. Now it's time
to turn Emma back into a human.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.710
- What?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.212
[panting, groans]

16:05.589 --> 16:07.216
- There you are.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.384
Where is she?

16:08.467 --> 16:10.969
- Whoa, what
happened to your face?

16:11.053 --> 16:12.346
- She did it.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.640
She turned my face
into a mood ring,

16:14.723 --> 16:15.724
and I'm not gonna
let her get away with it.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.686
- You think Emma did this?

16:18.769 --> 16:20.896
- No, Emma would never
do anything like that.

16:20.979 --> 16:22.523
Right, Andi?

16:22.606 --> 16:25.275
- Please, I see right
through your little charade.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.860
You are the worst actor.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.112
Now stand back.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.864
This bird isn't what
she appears to be.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.991
Back to a human
you shall now be.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.079
- Emma.
- We did it.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.123
- No, I did it.
- What?

16:42.251 --> 16:43.252
What happened?

16:43.335 --> 16:45.421
- You turned yourself
into a cockatoo.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.506
- I turned myself
into a cockatoo?

16:47.589 --> 16:49.591
- You did.
- We just changed you back.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.136
- We?
I changed you back.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.429
Now fix my face.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.263
- What happened to your face?

16:54.346 --> 16:55.556
Whoa!

16:55.639 --> 16:56.890
- You turned it
into a mood ring.

16:56.974 --> 16:57.933
- No, I didn't.

16:58.016 --> 16:59.309
- Oh, please,

16:59.393 --> 17:00.853
Daniel even tried to deny it,

17:00.936 --> 17:01.687
but I saw right through--

17:01.770 --> 17:05.190
[gasps]
You tricked me.

17:05.273 --> 17:06.900
- I'm sorry, Maddie.

17:06.983 --> 17:10.237
- You only did that to trick me
into changing Emma back for you.

17:10.319 --> 17:11.946
- Thank you.
- I had nothing to do with it.

17:12.030 --> 17:15.784
- Hello?
That thank you belongs to me.

17:15.867 --> 17:16.910
- Thanks, Maddie.

17:20.372 --> 17:23.291
- Um, a little help here.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.586
- [snickers]
- What happened to Jax?

17:25.669 --> 17:26.795
- Oh, bird man?

17:26.878 --> 17:28.505
Let's just say
he's afraid of feathers.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.591
- It's a phobia.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.885
It's a legitimate disease.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.595
I'm glad you're back, Emma.

17:34.678 --> 17:38.599
- Um, I don't mean to be rude,
but there's a storm coming and--

17:38.682 --> 17:40.726
- We're leaving, don't worry.
- Not me.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.978
I have to wait for the Panthers.

17:43.061 --> 17:44.897
They went to go get pizza.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.315
- Oh, let's get pizza.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.487
- Hey, wait, what about me?

17:58.410 --> 18:02.831
- Um, give me two of the one
for a dozen pizza special.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.417
- You know Dad's gonna be
furious when he finds out

18:05.501 --> 18:08.378
we're doing a buy 1,
get 12 free promotion.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.172
- I told you, it was a mistake.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.924
- Then go back
and say so on air.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.342
- No way, Miss Information
is never wrong.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.552
- Maybe, but she's gonna be
grounded for the next...

18:15.636 --> 18:18.305
hmm, dozen years.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.683
Who are you getting
all these pizzas for?

18:21.767 --> 18:24.186
- Oh, me and Emma.
- Just the two of you?

18:24.269 --> 18:27.815
- What are you gonna
do with...26 pizzas?

18:27.898 --> 18:30.567
BOTH: Pizza fort.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.155
- Are we done
waiting for Lily?

18:35.239 --> 18:38.700
She obviously
is not coming back.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.036
- That just proves my point.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.246
- We still have no proof

18:42.329 --> 18:45.249
that she's plotting anything,
Desdemona.

18:45.332 --> 18:48.210
- But the phone!

18:48.293 --> 18:51.213
What if she wants Emma

18:51.296 --> 18:52.339
to stay with Daniel
so that Emma

18:52.422 --> 18:55.884
gives up her powers
and gives them to Lily?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.386
- Hmm,

18:57.469 --> 19:00.305
a complicated scheme,
and a clever one as well.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.683
- I know.
I mean, I know.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.143
- We can look into it.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.270
But right now,
I better go prepare

19:06.353 --> 19:09.523
for this Storm-ageddon
that's coming.

19:09.606 --> 19:12.025
- It's not supposed
to hit until tomorrow.

19:12.109 --> 19:15.112
- Yes, but the Seven's
pizza special

19:15.195 --> 19:17.865
is only good
as long as supplies last.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.157
[laughs]

19:23.078 --> 19:26.206
- Now, to find a way

19:26.290 --> 19:28.750
to get Emma and Daniel

19:28.834 --> 19:30.460
back together.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.842
- Explain again this spell
you're casting

19:36.925 --> 19:38.468
to get Emma and Daniel
together.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.636
- It's not a spell.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.390
I texted Emma and Daniel
to meet at the school.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.641
They just can't
tell it's from me.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.561
- Wicked.

19:47.644 --> 19:50.105
You're a genius, Miss Minion.

19:50.188 --> 19:51.315
- Thank you.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.983
But it's just basic hacking.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.321
Done.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.697
- I'll do the rest.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.741
Stand back.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.077
I need a storm
to trap them at school.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.246
Nothing like a little
fear to unite people.

20:08.665 --> 20:12.044
- And shouldn't we check
to make sure they're there

20:12.127 --> 20:13.921
before starting the storm?

20:14.004 --> 20:15.380
- Please don't
over-think my plan.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.883
I am the evil mastermind.

20:21.803 --> 20:27.476
[evil laughing]

20:34.024 --> 20:36.318
<i>GIGI ON VIDEO: Intensity</i>
<i>of this storm is unprecedented.</i>

20:36.401 --> 20:39.488
<i>Everybody is ordered</i>
<i>to stay where they are</i>

20:39.571 --> 20:41.823
<i>until the storm passes.</i>

20:41.907 --> 20:45.160
<i>This is Miss Information</i>
<i>keeping you safe.</i>

20:45.243 --> 20:48.538
- And I was so looking
forward to those 13 pizzas.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.259
- There's no way that
storm is coming today.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.053
I was just outside
a few minutes ago--

21:03.136 --> 21:04.513
not a cloud in the sky.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.224
- It could just be
the calm before the....

21:07.307 --> 21:08.934
[thunder rumbles]
Storm.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.436
- Oh, way to jinx it.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.193
- "Working late,
meet me at school. Dad."

[sighs]

21:20.988 --> 21:22.322
Don't you know
there's a storm coming?

21:23.782 --> 21:25.450
On my way.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.289
- Are you staying long?

21:31.373 --> 21:33.709
- We have a new game
to show you.

21:33.792 --> 21:34.960
- Stay away from me!

21:35.043 --> 21:38.672
- T3, leave Maddie alone.
