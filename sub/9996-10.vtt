00:00.900 --> 00:02.466
<i>Previously on Medium:</i>

00:02.533 --> 00:05.600
Ashley's dad invited me, Madison, and Carla

00:05.600 --> 00:08.100
to go skiing at his cabin in Flagstaff next weekend.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.100
So it would just be, uh, you three girls and Ashley's dad?

00:11.166 --> 00:13.900
Well, Ashley's older brother Jamie will be there,

00:14.000 --> 00:17.132
and I, uh, think he's bringing a few friends, too.

00:17.132 --> 00:18.500
How much older is Ashley's...?

00:18.500 --> 00:19.533
He's a senior.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.100
You have to let me go on that ski trip.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.300
Why don't we talk about this tonight

00:24.300 --> 00:26.100
when your sisters are asleep.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.533
And tonight what?

00:27.533 --> 00:29.133
Your mind's made up. Dad's mind's made up.

00:29.300 --> 00:30.300
So just forget it.

00:31.100 --> 00:32.400
Okay, fine.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.466
Fine!

00:33.500 --> 00:36.000
Honey, could you go tell your sister in the kitchen that her room's ready?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.367
What are you talking about?

00:37.433 --> 00:39.066
She's not even home from school yet.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.400
You know, it's Friday.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.866
I bet she left school and went on that ski trip.

00:44.300 --> 00:46.166
Ariel?

00:50.400 --> 00:52.400
Time is priceless,

00:52.467 --> 00:54.600
<i>yet it costs us nothing.</i>

00:56.300 --> 01:00.200
<i>You can do anything you want with it...</i>

01:00.200 --> 01:01.200
<i>but own it.</i>

01:05.800 --> 01:08.867
<i>You can spend it, but you can't keep it.
(HAPPY 5TH BIRTHDAY MARIE!)</i>

01:09.600 --> 01:13.234
<i>And once you've lost it, there's no getting it back.</i>

01:14.100 --> 01:15.600
<i>It's just...</i>

01:16.000 --> 01:17.500
<i>gone.</i>

01:24.700 --> 01:28.800
Did you think I wasn't gonna come up there and get you?

01:30.399 --> 01:32.600
Did you honestly think that once we realized you were gone,

01:32.600 --> 01:34.900
that-that we were just gonna let you stay up there?

01:34.900 --> 01:37.600
That was the most humiliating experience of my entire life.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.600
Well, I'm sorry.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.133
The way you rang the doorbell?

01:40.800 --> 01:42.600
You woke everybody up and dragged me out of there

01:42.600 --> 01:44.700
- I didn't drag you.
- in front of all my friends! I hate you!

01:44.700 --> 01:46.500
Well, I can't do anything about that.

01:46.500 --> 01:49.400
We told you you couldn't go, and you went anyway.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.300
For no reason at all!

01:51.300 --> 01:53.700
It was just a ski trip!

01:53.700 --> 01:57.200
- Yes, with boys! With 18-year-old boys!
- So you don't trust me!

01:57.200 --> 01:58.900
No, I don't trust them, Ariel.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.600
You don't have to trust them!

02:00.600 --> 02:02.168
You have to trust me!

02:02.168 --> 02:04.800
I am older than you; I've lived longer than you;

02:04.800 --> 02:07.500
and I'd like to think that I've acquired a little bit of wisdom

02:07.500 --> 02:09.734
along the way that you might not have acquired yet!

02:10.699 --> 02:12.533
Couple years from now, you'll be old enough,

02:12.600 --> 02:15.000
you go out, you-you go to college, you'll be out of the house,

02:15.000 --> 02:16.800
you'll make your own decisions! Until then...

02:16.800 --> 02:17.800
Dad!

It's your sister's birthday tomorrow,

02:35.600 --> 02:38.300
so when you get up in the morning, I don't want any attitude, okay?

02:45.500 --> 02:47.233
Well, how did it go?

02:47.700 --> 02:49.834
How do you think it went?

02:50.400 --> 02:52.900
Did you hit any rain?

02:52.900 --> 02:55.700
What are you talking about? We haven't had rain here for a month.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.100
What did she say?

02:59.100 --> 03:01.334
She didn't say anything, not a word.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.900
I couldn't get her to talk to me the whole way home.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.800
How did we get here, Al?

03:06.800 --> 03:09.568
I mean, how the hell did we get here?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.800
No standing on tippy-toes. That's cheating.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.000
Oh, my goodness, I think we're looking at...at-

04:04.000 --> 04:06.566
at-at record-shattering heights here.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.534
Don't you feel dizzy being up that high?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.500
Ah, you, my dear, are officially five years tall!

04:14.900 --> 04:17.199
Happy birthday, baby!

04:17.700 --> 04:19.434
Can we have cake now?

04:19.700 --> 04:22.200
cake for breakfast? No, no, no.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.732
We must save that for later.

04:23.732 --> 04:24.800
Don't you remember?

04:24.800 --> 04:27.034
You and your friend Lauren are gonna have a play date.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.300
Then when Mama gets home,

04:28.300 --> 04:30.100
she and Daddy are gonna take you and your friends to the movies!

04:32.700 --> 04:34.201
Where are you going?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.400
I have to go to my boss's, do a little bit of work.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.400
But it's Saturday.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.032
Just be for a couple of hours.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.600
You know what, by the time you get here,

04:43.600 --> 04:46.000
I'll probably already be home.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.033
Happy birthday, sweetie!

04:52.200 --> 04:56.000
Hey, Ariel, um, can you help your sister with breakfast while I talk to your dad?

04:56.300 --> 04:57.500
Sure.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.800
Hey, I'm going straight to Mommy Hell, aren't I?

05:03.800 --> 05:05.167
It's only for a couple of hours,

05:05.234 --> 05:06.967
and it's not like you could have said no.

05:07.034 --> 05:08.767
You'll be here for all the important stuff.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.000
Okay, if I'm not back by 10:30, call Devalos, tell him the house is on fire.

05:13.000 --> 05:13.800
Okay.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.300
You know, you're a lot shorter than I was when I was five?

05:16.300 --> 05:17.534
Bridgette!

05:17.800 --> 05:19.132
Stop it.

05:19.132 --> 05:22.032
What's the big deal? You were a lot shorter than I was when I was five.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.900
Nuh-uh. Only a little bit.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.367
<i>Marie is a lot shorter than me.</i>

05:28.300 --> 05:30.900
I think it's because they broke you before you were born.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.000
Who broke me?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.500
Bridgette, why are you telling her things like that? It's her birthday.

05:35.568 --> 05:36.900
What? It's true.

05:36.967 --> 05:39.100
You know it's true. That's why she's short.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.733
That's why she has to wear glasses.

05:41.733 --> 05:43.900
Somebody broke me? Who broke me?

05:43.900 --> 05:45.767
What's going on in here?

05:45.767 --> 05:47.300
Who broke me, Daddy?

05:47.800 --> 05:49.434
What are you talking about?

05:49.900 --> 05:51.400
What is she talking about?

05:51.400 --> 05:52.900
Bridgette's telling her about the car accident,

05:52.900 --> 05:54.567
the one that happened just before she was born.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.100
She said you broke me.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.634
Whoa, whoa, whoa, nobody broke you.

06:00.100 --> 06:03.034
No, no, no, Mommy was in a car accident,

06:03.034 --> 06:05.401
and technically, you were, too,

06:05.401 --> 06:08.367
because you were just a little baby in Mommy's belly.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.600
But nothing happened to you. Nothing happened to anyone.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.934
It was a long time ago,

06:14.300 --> 06:16.200
when Mommy was pregnant with you.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.968
<i>Really pregnant.</i>

06:18.100 --> 06:20.200
She was, like, this big.

06:20.267 --> 06:21.800
She was driving through an intersection,

06:21.800 --> 06:24.199
and then a... a car ran a red light,

06:24.200 --> 06:27.333
and, um, actually, it wasn't a... car.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.333
It was a plumber's van, a Klog King plumber's van.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.867
And it broke me?

06:32.934 --> 06:34.533
No, sweetie, you were fine.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.400
At first we worried about you, but you turned out fine.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.866
You weren't broken. You were a perfect little baby.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.733
And now you're a perfect little...

06:42.300 --> 06:44.300
five-year-old girl.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.433
Hello?

07:08.433 --> 07:09.800
Mr. Devalos?

07:13.100 --> 07:16.600
Mr. Devalos, it's Allison.

07:18.634 --> 07:20.033
Oh. Good.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.900
Uh, sir, I brought those files that you wanted to go over with me.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.000
Wha...

07:29.100 --> 07:30.900
Who are you?

07:30.900 --> 07:34.200
Please, she has nothing to do with this. You came here for me. Just...

07:34.500 --> 07:35.600
let her go.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.066
I asked you a question.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.700
We work together.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.166
Please, just...

07:42.300 --> 07:45.100
put the gun down. Let's... let's talk about this.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.866
There is nothing to talk about.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.700
You took five years away from me.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.801
Five years.

07:52.867 --> 07:55.000
You ruined my life.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.200
Now...

07:57.067 --> 07:59.101
- I'm gonna ruin yours.
- Please...

08:10.600 --> 08:13.600
No, no, no! Please! Please, please, please, please don't! Please!

08:13.600 --> 08:15.300
It's my daughter's birthday.

08:25.267 --> 08:26.866
Are you... are you okay?

08:27.100 --> 08:28.700
Can-can you hear me?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.433
Are you okay?

08:32.100 --> 08:35.200
I'm so sorry. I-I thought I could make the yellow light,

08:35.200 --> 08:37.200
and when you pulled through, I...

08:37.200 --> 08:39.433
I was going to fast, and...

08:41.133 --> 08:42.799
Oh, my God.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.700
You're pregnant.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.633
What are you talking about?

08:46.900 --> 08:48.500
I hit a pregnant lady.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.700
KLOG KING
DON'T "GAMBLE" ON YOUR PLUMBING

08:57.700 --> 08:59.601
What day is it?

08:59.601 --> 09:01.200
Uh, M-Monday. Why?

09:01.200 --> 09:02.600
What-what year is it?

09:02.601 --> 09:03.900
Are you serious?

09:03.900 --> 09:05.733
You don't know what year it is?

09:05.800 --> 09:08.200
Uh, may-maybe you should sit down.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.200
Uh, you want me to walk you to the curb?

09:10.200 --> 09:11.800
Have we met before?

09:12.100 --> 09:14.000
Have we done this before?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.733
What do you... what do you mean, had an accident?

09:17.200 --> 09:18.700
Who's the president?

09:18.700 --> 09:20.200
Of the United States?

09:20.266 --> 09:21.733
Lady, you're scaring me.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.933
Okay, forget that.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.433
What-what year is this?

09:27.433 --> 09:29.232
Uh, you-you know the year, right?

09:29.299 --> 09:30.933
It's 2004.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.167
Bush is the president.

09:33.333 --> 09:35.367
You had a bad accident.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.300
Let me walk you to the curb.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.801
CALM YOU DOWN. OK?

09:45.400 --> 09:48.434
You are a very lucky woman, Mrs. Dubois.

09:49.100 --> 09:53.200
The car accident seems to have caused no damage at all to the baby.

09:53.400 --> 09:57.100
<i>But just to be safe, I'm gonna speak to your OB-GYN this afternoon,</i>

09:57.600 --> 09:59.700
ask him or her to keep a close eye on things.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.800
Oh, don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.800
She's gonna be a beautiful, healthy baby.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.499
Oh, I didn't realize. You already know the sex?

10:10.167 --> 10:12.566
Hi. Are you okay?

10:13.100 --> 10:14.233
Oh, my God.

10:14.700 --> 10:16.300
I got here as fast as I could.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.100
She's fine, Mr. Dubois.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.333
And the baby appears to be just fine as well.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.932
Thank God.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.200
Look at you. You're so calm.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.700
Talked to the guy from the body shop. Apparently, you know,

10:31.700 --> 10:33.700
a new windshield, which is pretty obvious, they,

10:34.433 --> 10:37.700
they're gonna have to replace the door and the front quarter panel.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.200
They said they got to check the frame before they can give us a final estimate.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.399
What are you grinning about?

10:43.800 --> 10:46.900
You've just come back from the hospital from a horrific accident, Allison.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.800
You could have been killed. The baby could have been killed.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.800
No, no. Sorry.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.067
What?!

10:55.700 --> 10:57.600
Just all of this.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.934
This car, I never thought I'd see this car again.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.400
And you like this.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.533
Like what?

11:05.700 --> 11:07.301
Younger.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.367
Younger than what?

11:09.500 --> 11:11.000
Allison, you're not making any sense.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.767
All right, I know, I know.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.500
You're not gonna understand, but this, uh...

11:17.900 --> 11:22.500
this whole thing, this being hit by the van, spending time in the hospital,

11:22.500 --> 11:25.400
you talking about the auto body shop right now.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.134
All of it,

11:27.200 --> 11:28.934
it's like I've been here before.

11:28.934 --> 11:32.767
Like, like I'm in the middle of this big deju vu.

11:34.934 --> 11:36.968
Oh. What?

11:37.600 --> 11:41.600
Honey, why do you suddenly look so sad?

11:41.800 --> 11:43.367
Hey, everything's gonna be fine.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.900
Come on. Smile.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.400
I'm sorry, but I'm not good at this, you know?

11:47.400 --> 11:50.900
I just... when you start talking about all this-this stuff,

11:50.900 --> 11:52.366
I'm not good at it. I can't smile.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.600
I... You could have... you could have died today.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.600
I mean, when they, when they called me on the phone,

11:58.600 --> 12:00.300
I almost had a heart attack.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.600
On top of that, I'm missing work. I mean, I don't see the humor in this.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.900
Where's the humor in this?

12:03.900 --> 12:05.700
There's no humor in this.

12:05.800 --> 12:06.800
You mean this?

12:06.800 --> 12:08.300
Me saying this to you right now?

12:08.300 --> 12:10.000
This conversation, this is deju  vu, too?

12:10.000 --> 12:13.400
This is some sort of experience that you've had before?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.700
No, I've never had this conversation before.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.100
Good, because I'm living my life, you know,

12:17.100 --> 12:19.300
right now, this moment, for the first time.

12:19.300 --> 12:21.700
And I'm, honestly, I'm worried about you.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.800
I'm worried about our baby,

12:22.800 --> 12:24.267
and I'm worried about our other babies.

12:24.267 --> 12:26.900
And I-I-I'm seriously wondering if I should turn this car around

12:26.900 --> 12:30.000
and drive you back to the hospital to have them look at you a little bit more.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.600
No, no, no. Honey, I told you,

12:31.600 --> 12:33.500
that is not necessary. Everything is fine.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.333
There's no more deju vu.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.700
The deju vu is gone, okay?

12:41.600 --> 12:43.533
Thank you.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.200
Okay. Now...

12:50.700 --> 12:52.900
all right. Listen, um,

12:52.900 --> 12:54.800
I called the university from the hospital,

12:54.800 --> 12:56.400
and I left messages for all your professors.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.400
I told them that definitely you're not coming in

12:58.500 --> 13:00.600
till the end of the week and maybe even longer.

13:01.700 --> 13:04.200
Okay? Now, promise me you're gonna go in the house and lie down.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.334
I'm gonna go pick up Ariel from school

13:07.334 --> 13:09.968
and Bridgette from day care, okay?

13:10.100 --> 13:11.334
If anything happens, anything,

13:11.399 --> 13:12.933
contractions, anything, I got my pager,

13:12.933 --> 13:14.299
I got my cell phone.

13:14.366 --> 13:16.332
Honey, nothing's gonna happen for weeks.

13:16.332 --> 13:18.500
You don't know that. You don't know that.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.800
Well, it may be circumstantial, but it's also very compelling.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.900
There's no doubt in my mind that this jury will find

13:27.900 --> 13:31.300
Nathan Hunsecker guilty of murdering his wife, none whatsoever.

13:31.366 --> 13:34.033
As I'm sure most of our viewers are aware,

13:34.100 --> 13:37.200
Jessamyn Hunsecker disappeared almost six weeks ago.

13:37.267 --> 13:40.233
Shortly after going missing, police arrested her husband,

13:40.299 --> 13:43.299
Nathan Hunsecker, and charged him with murder.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.134
My God, that's him.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.067
Mom!

13:52.100 --> 13:54.400
Are you okay?

13:54.400 --> 13:56.033
Dad told us what happened.

13:56.033 --> 13:57.233
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.700
You feel okay?

14:00.700 --> 14:03.100
I need to talk to you for a second.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.700
Okay. So, uh, in the future,

14:05.700 --> 14:08.067
you work for the district attorney's office.

14:08.134 --> 14:10.167
And, uh, this guy, uh, Hunsecker,

14:10.167 --> 14:12.034
who he's trying to put away right now,

14:12.034 --> 14:14.334
he's gonna end up shooting and killing you both,

14:14.500 --> 14:18.667
murdering you both, uh, in the district attorney's house.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.767
In the future, five years from now, yes.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.100
In the future.

14:24.100 --> 14:25.900
I feel like I need to warn him.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.300
I'm sorry. Warn who?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.000
The distri attorney.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.700
Look, I see you're having a tough time with this.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.000
I see that I'm upsetting you.

14:36.067 --> 14:37.700
I'm sorry.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.933
But maybe that's why this is all happening.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.133
Maybe this is why I woke up in 2004.

14:44.700 --> 14:49.000
You know, in the future, I talk to you about this kind of stuff all the time.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.700
What do you want me to say?

14:51.700 --> 14:53.833
I want you to tell me what to do.

14:53.900 --> 14:55.900
Darling, I don't think there's anything to do.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.400
You don't know the district attorney.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.801
And more importantly, he doesn't know you.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.200
CLOVE LAKE PARK. PARK CLOSES AT SUNDOWN.

15:24.068 --> 15:26.267
Mrs. Hunsecker, you came.

15:26.600 --> 15:27.900
Against my better judgment.

15:27.900 --> 15:28.700
Come on. Don't say that.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.400
I don't know why you need to keep going around about this.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.034
It's not like there were any surprises.

15:33.034 --> 15:34.567
I couldn't have been clearer.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.101
This thing we had-- it was all about having fun.

15:38.267 --> 15:40.100
And we had fun.

15:40.167 --> 15:41.400
And we can have more fun.

15:41.466 --> 15:42.733
I don't think so.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.833
Why? Because I like you?

15:45.100 --> 15:46.067
Because I care?

15:46.067 --> 15:47.600
I'm married.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.900
I'm not looking to be liked.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.599
I'm not looking to be cared about.

15:50.599 --> 15:51.833
That I get at home.

15:58.133 --> 15:59.600
You know you love me.

15:59.700 --> 16:00.700
No.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.433
I like you.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.566
I've always liked you.

16:04.633 --> 16:06.433
But I love my husband.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.600
Just like you, love my husband.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.200
So I need you to look at me and tell me you understand it's over.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.699
- Please.
- Jess.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.700
No more calls.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.600
No more e-mails, or I'll tell him.

16:18.667 --> 16:22.268
I'll tell Nate everything, and that would be bad for me.

16:22.334 --> 16:24.900
But we both know that would be bad for you, too.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.100
Okay.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.433
I understand.

16:37.934 --> 16:41.400
But, um, you don't have to go right now,

16:41.400 --> 16:43.800
- do you? Because I-I
- As a matter of fact, I need to...

16:43.801 --> 16:45.233
made us a picnic.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.267
It's the middle of the night.

16:47.334 --> 16:48.300
Yeah, it's a...

16:48.367 --> 16:50.300
candlelight picnic.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.300
Candles, tablecloth on the ground,

16:52.300 --> 16:53.900
- I'm sorry.
- wine...Please,

16:53.933 --> 16:57.200
will you just please come, just look at it?

16:58.200 --> 16:59.666
Spent the past 45 minutes setting it up

16:59.800 --> 17:00.833
I mean, look at me.

17:01.266 --> 17:03.300
You don't have to eat anything or drink anything.

17:03.300 --> 17:07.434
Just please, at least come look at it.

17:07.601 --> 17:10.367
Okay? Don't make me fold it up and put it away

17:10.434 --> 17:12.300
and bring it home, knowing you didn't even see it.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.500
Okay.

17:16.567 --> 17:17.733
Fine.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.034
I'll take a look.

17:19.101 --> 17:21.167
But then I've got to go.

17:21.234 --> 17:22.534
Okay.

17:29.701 --> 17:31.068
What do you think?

17:31.134 --> 17:32.801
I don't get it.

17:32.868 --> 17:34.934
Where's the picnic?

17:35.001 --> 17:36.801
I don't see any candles.

17:40.068 --> 17:41.667
What is this?

17:41.734 --> 17:43.335
This?

17:43.400 --> 17:46.601
Well, this is what you wanted.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.500
This is me showing you I understand.

17:49.567 --> 17:51.900
No. Please, please don't shoot me. Please!

17:53.500 --> 17:54.900
Oh, my God.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.700
Hello, hi. My name is Allison Dubois,

18:02.700 --> 18:05.834
and I-I'm trying to reach the district attorney.

18:05.899 --> 18:08.700
I have some information about the Nathan Hunsecker case,

18:08.700 --> 18:09.934
and I was given this number.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.000
Uh, good morning, Mrs. Dubois. This is Officer Scanlon.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.900
So, uh, what kind of information are we talking about here?

18:17.900 --> 18:22.000
Wait, I'm sorry. Did you say Officer Scanlon, not Detective Scanlon?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.100
Uh, no, ma'am.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.500
Detectives, uh... they don't work the tip line.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.633
Officers do.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.934
Now, what can I do for you today?

18:28.934 --> 18:30.300
O-Okay.

18:30.300 --> 18:34.000
Well, um, Officer Scanlon, uh,

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
I have reason to believe that the district attorney is prosecuting the wrong man.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.700
Actually, I know for a fact that Nathan Hunsecker didn't kill his wife.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.100
Another man did.

18:43.300 --> 18:46.801
If you like, I can give you a detailed description of what this man looked like.

18:46.801 --> 18:50.200
I can even tell you where he buried Jessamyn Hunsecker's body.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.500
So wait a second.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.333
Are you telling me that you're a witness?

18:53.400 --> 18:55.767
You telling me you actually saw this murder being committed?

18:57.100 --> 19:00.000
Well, no, no. Not exactly.

19:00.533 --> 19:01.700
Well, I don't understand. How is it you know

19:01.700 --> 19:04.800
what the real killer looks like if you didn't actually see him commit the murder?

19:05.100 --> 19:07.700
And how would you know where the body was buried if you didn't see someone bury it?

19:08.700 --> 19:09.900
I'm sorry. Could you please, uh,

19:09.900 --> 19:11.133
spell your name again for me, ma'am?

19:12.600 --> 19:14.500
Hello? Ma'am, are you there?

19:15.700 --> 19:19.000
You do understand it's a crime to knowingly provide false information to the police.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.600
Don't you think you ought to have some breakfast?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.333
It's Tuesday. It's waffle day.

19:24.399 --> 19:26.099
Your favorite.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.166
Today's Tuesday?

19:27.600 --> 19:28.600
All day.

19:31.666 --> 19:35.433
Hey, um, how would you feel about me borrowing your car?

19:35.499 --> 19:38.400
I could just give the girls a ride to-to day care and school.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.234
And I could give you a ride to work.

19:40.900 --> 19:43.834
What, are you, are you feeling well enough to go to class?

19:45.100 --> 19:49.100
Well, I just, uh, have a little errand I'd like to run.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.300
Thanks, Lucy.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.100
Excuse me, Mr. District Attorney.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.100
I'm sorry to disturb your lunch.

19:59.166 --> 20:01.900
I tried to call your office, but they wouldn't put me through.

20:02.833 --> 20:05.900
I have information regarding the Nathan Hunsecker case,

20:05.900 --> 20:08.099
information I think might help prove his innocence.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.200
Really?

20:10.600 --> 20:14.400
I'm-I'm sorry. Do... we know each other? Have we met?

20:16.300 --> 20:17.700
Um, sit down, please.

20:17.700 --> 20:20.500
Uh, you look like you should be sitting down.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.166
Um, I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.200
It's Dubois. Allison Dubois.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.200
Okay, Ms. Dubois.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.500
Um, what is it you wanted to tell me?

20:33.500 --> 20:37.800
I can give you a description of the man who shot Jessamyn Hunsecker.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.300
I can even show you where she's buried.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.900
Well, that's quite a tip.

20:41.900 --> 20:44.401
Uh, may I ask how you came to know all this?

20:45.400 --> 20:47.300
Well, it'd be simpler if you didn't.

20:47.300 --> 20:51.100
The important thing is I can take you straight to where her body is.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.000
We can even go in the same car, if you like.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.667
And did you tell the police all this?

20:56.100 --> 20:57.600
I tried.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.800
What was the problem?

20:59.866 --> 21:03.000
They asked me what you asked me. They wanted to know how I knew.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.633
And what did you say?

21:04.699 --> 21:05.799
I hung up.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.700
Are you afraid to tell me how you know?

21:11.700 --> 21:12.900
If you're involved in this crime,

21:12.900 --> 21:16.000
I may be able to offer you some form of arrangement,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.534
some leniency in return for your testimony.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.199
I wasn't involved.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.199
I saw it in a dream.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.200
Excuse me?

21:31.200 --> 21:32.900
I know how this sounds,.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.900
but I have them l the time These dreams, I mean. Dreams that show me things.

21:35.900 --> 21:38.500
And they're actually quite accurate.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.733
So does that mean we're going?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.600
Does that mean you want me to show you the body?

21:42.600 --> 21:46.500
<i>No. This means I'm going.</i>

21:49.200 --> 21:50.900
But, sir, he's gonna kill you.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.200
What did you just say?

21:57.200 --> 21:58.900
Nathan Hunsecker.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.300
In five years, he's gonna come to your house

22:00.300 --> 22:01.900
and he's gonna shoot you,

22:01.900 --> 22:04.600
and I'm guessing it's 'cause you convict him of a crime he didn't commit.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.300
Okay, miss, look, my instinct is to turn and leave,

22:07.300 --> 22:10.200
but I can see you're very pregnant and I'm concerned about your mental health.

22:11.100 --> 22:13.400
Are you under someone's care? Is there someone I can call?

22:13.400 --> 22:14.500
No, there's no one to call.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.167
I just... I need you to understand.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.500
I see things.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.300
Sometimes I even know things that haven't happened yet.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.000
And I understand that that sounds crazy,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.800
but believe it or not, in a few years you're gonna come to depend on me.

22:29.100 --> 22:30.667
We're gonna work together.

22:30.733 --> 22:32.000
We're gonna be friends.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.400
How do you think I knew that you were gonna be here?

22:35.400 --> 22:38.400
Because one day, years from now, when we're friends,

22:38.400 --> 22:42.100
you're gonna tell me that you come here every Tuesday for a carnita sandwich,

22:42.100 --> 22:44.300
that they are the best in the city,

22:44.500 --> 22:49.600
that they remind you of sandwiches that your Aunt Maria used to make when you'd visit her in Rosarita.

22:51.500 --> 22:56.300
Please, sir, just, just send someone to the entrance of Clove Lake Park.

22:56.700 --> 22:59.700
She's buried in a shallow grave right inside the tree line.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.467
She was shot once in the head.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.767
Do you know where the extra toothbrushes are?

23:13.500 --> 23:15.800
Hey, do you hear me?

23:16.600 --> 23:19.867
Oh, yeah, sorry. Huh.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.400
I'm gonna have another baby.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.700
Here I was thinking we were done with all this,

23:24.700 --> 23:28.300
but now I'm about to do it all over again.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.033
for the fourth time.

23:30.099 --> 23:31.934
Talk about being the last to know.

23:32.800 --> 23:36.800
Boy, do I feel dumb. Here I was, I thought I was packing your bag for our third baby.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.700
Yeah, I noticed that. Why are you doing that?

23:40.700 --> 23:43.600
Call me crazy, seeing that your due date is tomorrow.

23:43.700 --> 23:45.300
Do you have a preference?

23:45.300 --> 23:46.634
Not really.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.966
Hey, you know, you don't have to rush to pack this bag.

23:51.033 --> 23:53.600
Marie's late. She's not even gonna be here for three weeks.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.400
We're having another girl?

24:04.100 --> 24:07.400
You know what? I forgot that we weren't gonna find out this time.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.300
Well, who could that be? It's almost 10:00 at night.

24:12.300 --> 24:13.599
You don't know?

24:13.900 --> 24:15.700
You know everything else!

24:18.300 --> 24:19.300
Can I help you?

24:19.300 --> 24:21.701
Evening, sir. We're looking for Allison Dubois.

24:22.768 --> 24:24.400
Uh, what is this regarding?

24:24.400 --> 24:26.100
Our district attorney would like to speak to her

24:26.100 --> 24:29.300
about some information that she passed on regarding the Hunsecker case.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.632
Are you Allison Dubois?

24:30.800 --> 24:33.134
Information? What kind of information?

24:33.134 --> 24:35.033
Do you have any idea what he's talking about?

24:35.300 --> 24:37.866
I know exactly what he's talking about.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.300
Anyway, folks, we should get going.

24:40.300 --> 24:43.000
It's important that the district attorney speak with her this evening.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.733
As you can see, my wife is very pregnant.

24:45.733 --> 24:47.466
Honey, can you stay with the kids?

24:47.700 --> 24:50.034
I'll just run and get dressed.

24:50.034 --> 24:52.466
Appreciate your cooperation, ma'am.

24:53.800 --> 24:58.500
Despite my better judgment, I sent a team of investigators out to Clove Lake Park this afternoon.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.100
Jessamyn Hunsecker's body was exactly where you said it would be,

25:03.000 --> 25:04.800
shot once in the head.

25:04.800 --> 25:08.367
Well, you're very welcome.

25:11.100 --> 25:13.500
I didn't bring you here to thank you, Mrs. Dubois.

25:13.500 --> 25:17.100
You're here because I still need you to tell me how you knew what you knew.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.900
Notwithstanding our conversation earlier in the day,

25:19.900 --> 25:22.200
I need a plausible explanation.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.900
I already gave you the only explanation I have.

25:25.100 --> 25:26.700
Were you a witness?

25:26.700 --> 25:28.133
Were you an accessory?

25:28.400 --> 25:33.400
I promise you. I had nothing to do with what happened to Jessamyn Hunsecker.

25:33.400 --> 25:37.100
I'm sorry, but your promise is of no value to me and of no help to you.

25:37.100 --> 25:41.300
I need an explanation, a real-world explanation.

25:46.300 --> 25:48.000
You should know that when the body was exhumed

25:48.000 --> 25:51.500
the crime scene unit believed they found some DNA on Miss Hunsecker's clothing.

25:52.100 --> 25:53.200
What kind of DNA?

25:53.200 --> 25:55.400
I'd rather not say.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.100
Just that we suspect that it belongs to someone

25:57.100 --> 25:59.167
who had something to do with Mrs. Hunsecker's death.

26:01.200 --> 26:05.700
I'm sure that you won't mind providing a DNA sample of your own to the police for comparison?

26:05.700 --> 26:06.900
No, of course not.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.867
That was easy.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.900
Now if you'll just tell me how you came to know where the body was buried.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.833
I already told you.

26:18.900 --> 26:21.600
So your only explanation

26:21.700 --> 26:23.700
is that it all came to you in a dream?

26:23.700 --> 26:25.200
<i>It's not my only explanation.</i>

26:25.200 --> 26:27.867
<i>It's the only explanation.</i>

26:30.300 --> 26:31.500
Well, then you leave me no choice.

26:31.500 --> 26:34.000
Officer, would you please take Mrs. Dubois to the booking desk?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.300
Wha... what are you doing?

26:36.500 --> 26:39.700
I'm having you placed under arrest for obstruction of justice.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.900
I haven't done anything wrong.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.600
You have the right to an attorney.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.333
If you can't afford one, one will be provided for you.

26:48.367 --> 26:49.600
Can I please just see my wife?

26:49.600 --> 26:50.999
She's nine months pregnant.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.066
Your wife's in booking now,

26:52.133 --> 26:54.000
Mr. Dubois. She's being processed.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.700
In the morning, she'll go before the judge.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.100
In the morning?

26:57.200 --> 26:59.500
Did you not hear the part about her being nine months pregnant?

26:59.500 --> 27:01.900
Her due date is tomorrow.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.101
Look, I know that she can say some...

27:04.300 --> 27:06.300
you know, some pretty crazy things,

27:06.300 --> 27:08.100
but there's no way that she killed someone.

27:08.200 --> 27:10.100
Look, maybe she did. Maybe she didn't.

27:10.900 --> 27:14.900
I don't know. All I know is she knew exactly where Jessamyn Hunsecker's body was buried.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.433
And that can't be explained by hormones.

27:17.433 --> 27:19.300
Excuse me.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.466
Officer Scanlon.

27:23.300 --> 27:26.167
I'm actually talking to the husband right now.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.300
You're kidding.

27:28.700 --> 27:32.467
No, I'll tell him, yeah. All right, all right.

27:33.700 --> 27:36.000
That was the District Attorney's office.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.600
Looks like you'll be seeing your wife a lot sooner than we thought.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.000
Mrs. Dubois, I'm gonna give you one last chance

28:02.100 --> 28:05.800
to tell me how you knew where to find Jessamyn Hunsecker's body.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.134
It's like I said.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.400
It came to me in a dream. I saw her face.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.334
I saw the face of the man who murdered her.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.567
All right, then.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.600
You're free to go. Your husband's waiting for you.

28:23.100 --> 28:27.500
I don't understand. Are you saying that I'm no longer under arrest?

28:27.500 --> 28:28.800
That's exactly what I'm saying.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.834
The case against Nathan Hunsecker is closed.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.000
Well, how can that be?

28:33.500 --> 28:35.233
That is impossible.

28:36.100 --> 28:38.100
He didn't do it. He didn't kill his wife.

28:38.100 --> 28:40.700
As it happens, Mr. Hunsecker doesn't agree with you.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.700
I just got off the phone with his attorney.

28:42.700 --> 28:45.268
In exchange for reducing the charges to second-degree murder,

28:45.300 --> 28:48.400
Mr. Hunsecker's changing his plea from not guilty to guilty.

28:48.400 --> 28:52.200
You can't take that deal. You mustn't take that deal. This man is innocent.

28:52.200 --> 28:56.700
Mrs. Dubois, in my experience, innocent men don't typically plead guilty.

28:56.700 --> 29:00.200
Oh, my God, Mr. District Attorney, you're making a big mistake.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.833
Maybe I am, and maybe I'm not.

29:02.900 --> 29:05.533
But let me offer you some advice.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.399
I think you're a deeply disturbed woman.

29:07.900 --> 29:09.700
I believe you need professional help,

29:09.700 --> 29:11.601
and for the sake of your husband and your children,

29:12.000 --> 29:13.401
I hope you get it.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.100
Until then, know this:

29:15.100 --> 29:18.300
if you ever interfere with another city investigation again,

29:18.300 --> 29:21.700
I will see to it that you are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.833
I got Mrs. Richards from across the street to watch the girls.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.700
I lied and told her you thought you were having contractions,

29:40.700 --> 29:42.100
so I put you in a cab.

29:42.100 --> 29:46.800
Just so when we get home, we'll just tell her it was a false alarm, okay?

29:47.600 --> 29:48.600
Thanks for coming to get me.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.967
Yeah. Can I ask you something?

29:51.034 --> 29:54.700
Um, that cop-- he said that you told the police

29:54.700 --> 29:56.900
exactly where to find that woman's body.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.767
How did you do that?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.101
How did you know?

30:14.600 --> 30:18.199
So it's a girl, huh?

30:18.600 --> 30:20.900
Marie?

30:21.400 --> 30:23.433
She's not coming for another three weeks?

30:26.900 --> 30:29.600
She's dead?

30:30.600 --> 30:32.334
Jessamyn's dead?

30:33.300 --> 30:35.234
I'm sorry, Nate.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.933
They found her body out at Clove Lake Park.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.467
Listen, I know this is difficult,

30:47.500 --> 30:50.100
but I need you to focus.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.166
I need you to make some tough decisions here.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.400
We have a window of opportunity,

30:55.400 --> 30:57.233
but it's going to close quickly.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.901
I think it's time we talked to the District Attorney about cutting a deal.

31:03.100 --> 31:06.200
What? Why-why would I do that?

31:06.200 --> 31:08.167
Why would I make a deal?

31:08.234 --> 31:09.399
Nate...

31:15.900 --> 31:19.300
Manuel Devalos is going to crucify you.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.400
You've already handed him the cross and the nails.

31:22.400 --> 31:25.500
You don't even know where you were the night Jessamyn disappeared.

31:26.100 --> 31:30.267
Now, this guy-- he means to win this case.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.701
His credibility is riding on it.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.300
He's a ruthless political animal.

31:35.300 --> 31:37.600
Anybody who's ever gone up against him will tell you that.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.034
He will go to any lengths to win.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.367
And frany...

31:43.100 --> 31:49.500
it wouldn't surprise me if he had his detectives plant evidence on your wife's body to incriminate you.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.000
And then you're staring at the death penalty.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
But, I can't make a deal.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.800
I-I didn't kill her.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.133
Nate...

32:02.300 --> 32:04.700
We go back a ways.

32:04.700 --> 32:06.700
I took this case as a favor to you.

32:06.767 --> 32:08.334
I even waived my fee,

32:08.400 --> 32:11.334
but if you're gonna ignore my advice,

32:11.400 --> 32:14.101
then I have no choice but to recuse myself.

32:22.634 --> 32:24.400
Fine.

32:28.700 --> 32:30.433
Call the District Attorney's office.

32:44.200 --> 32:48.233
I'm sorry, Nathan, but this really is the only way.

32:58.300 --> 32:59.300
Thank you, counselor.

32:59.300 --> 33:00.800
I appreciate your cooperation.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.633
Mr. District Attorney?

33:05.200 --> 33:07.467
Whatever you do, don't make a deal with this man.

33:07.533 --> 33:10.200
Mrs. Dubois, I had hoped that I'd seen the last of you.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.800
I told you before, and I'll tell you again.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.468
Nathan Hunsecker is innocent.

33:14.700 --> 33:17.600
I'm sorry, Mrs. Dubois, but you are deeply misinformed.

33:17.600 --> 33:21.500
Nathan Hunsecker himself just stood with me and his attorney here in front of the judge

33:21.500 --> 33:23.600
and pleaded guilty to second degree murder.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.100
No, that can't be. He didn't kill her.

33:26.100 --> 33:27.100
His attorney did.

33:27.100 --> 33:28.500
I beg your pardon? Who are you

33:28.500 --> 33:31.300
and how dare you level those accusations against me?

33:31.300 --> 33:33.200
Please, counselor, ignore her.

33:33.200 --> 33:34.300
She's a public nuisance,

33:34.300 --> 33:37.300
but I promise you she poses no real threat. Officer!

33:37.300 --> 33:38.968
No, no, no, no!

33:39.100 --> 33:42.500
He was having an affair with his client's wife.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.200
- Please escort her through the courthouse.
- She wanted to end it,

33:44.200 --> 33:47.000
and she threatened to tell her husband. That's why he killed her!

33:47.000 --> 33:48.700
He should be the one going to prison!

33:48.700 --> 33:50.933
Don't do this! You're making a big mistake!

33:53.800 --> 33:55.100
Let's sit her down over here.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.300
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness.

33:57.300 --> 33:58.933
Nice and easy now, nice and easy.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.900
It's okay. It's okay.

34:00.900 --> 34:02.600
Go call an ambulance.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.467
Shh, just do yourself a favor. Sit still.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.500
Your water broke.

34:10.500 --> 34:13.100
No... No, no, no. this isn't right.

34:13.699 --> 34:17.900
No, please.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.800
Marie isn't supposed to come for another three weeks.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.199
This isn't supposed to be happeng.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.699
Don't try to move, Mrs. Dubois.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.400
You're in labor and you've lost a significant amount of blood.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.033
Unfortunately, your baby is in breach,

34:35.100 --> 34:37.900
and we're going to have to perform an emergency cesarean section.

34:37.900 --> 34:39.900
We need to get your baby out now.

34:39.900 --> 34:42.366
I'm right here, Allison. I'm right next to you, okay?

34:42.366 --> 34:43.366
Everything's going to be fine.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.300
Fetal heartbeat's fading.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.699
- What's going on?
- Let's get her prepped!

34:46.699 --> 34:48.433
Gloves and gown.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.300
It's gonna be okay, Allison. Everything's gonna be okay.

34:55.100 --> 34:56.199
Joe, I'm sorry.

34:56.199 --> 34:57.432
I screwed everything up.

34:57.432 --> 34:59.866
It's all my fault.

35:01.300 --> 35:04.100
Stay with me Allison, okay? You have to stay with me.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.601
Stay with me...

35:22.100 --> 35:24.000
You're still up?

35:24.067 --> 35:26.434
I was sure you'd be asleep.

35:26.500 --> 35:30.500
Yeah, I was, I mean, I guess I was till like a minute ago.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.100
Hey, who's the president?

35:33.300 --> 35:34.467
What?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.900
Just forget that question.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.700
Is it Marie's birthday tomorrow?

35:39.600 --> 35:41.167
Yeah, number five.

35:41.500 --> 35:45.100
And don't think I didn't remind Ariel of that out in the hallway just now.

35:45.900 --> 35:47.500
Ariel, r-right.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.434
You just picked her up at her friend's ski house?

35:49.500 --> 35:50.500
How'd that go?

35:50.567 --> 35:51.834
How do you think it went?

35:52.100 --> 35:53.434
She didn't say a thing.

35:53.500 --> 35:54.900
Not a word.

35:54.900 --> 35:57.167
I couldn't get her to talk to me the whole way home.

35:57.234 --> 35:58.700
I mean, how did we get here, Al?

35:59.000 --> 36:00.500
HOW THE HELL DID WE GET HERE?

36:11.600 --> 36:13.566
I know you're mad.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.765
I know you're angry.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.234
But Daddy and I didn't let you go on that weekend

36:26.299 --> 36:28.900
with those 18-year-old boys 'cause you're not 18 yet.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.533
But you know what?

36:33.800 --> 36:36.299
Soon enough, you will be.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.466
And then you're gonna be 19.

36:38.533 --> 36:42.834
And then in a blink of an eye, you're gonna be 40.

36:42.900 --> 36:47.700
And the chances are that you're gonna be sitting here with your 16-year-old,

36:47.700 --> 36:52.500
trying to explain to her why she had to wait to do something.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
But...

36:57.000 --> 37:02.300
all this time that you're choosing to be angry at Daddy and I, you know, it's...

37:03.500 --> 37:06.100
It's time that you could have spent being happy.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.300
Time...

37:08.300 --> 37:09.834
It's just gone.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.600
And you never get it back.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.266
I mean, there, tre, there's a second gone.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.800
And you'll never have it again.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.634
And there, there's another one.

37:19.300 --> 37:20.833
It's just wasted.

37:21.300 --> 37:25.700
We wasted it just holding on to anger.

37:29.900 --> 37:33.200
Honey, am I making sense? I'm not even sure I'm making sense.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
But honey, just know this:

37:38.000 --> 37:40.500
that tomorrow when you wake up, you're gonna be a day older,

37:40.900 --> 37:42.767
and you're gonna be a day closer

37:43.000 --> 37:45.934
to being old enough to do whatever you want.

37:46.400 --> 37:49.000
And you're gonna get that

37:49.000 --> 37:51.867
whether you're angry at Daddy and me or not.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.634
It's your choice.

38:02.901 --> 38:04.734
Just know that I love you.

38:25.300 --> 38:26.533
What are you doing?

38:27.100 --> 38:29.700
Setting the alarm clock for 5:30.

38:29.700 --> 38:31.200
What on earth for?

38:31.200 --> 38:33.400
'Cause I don't want to miss Marie's birthday.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.100
What are you talking about?

38:35.100 --> 38:36.400
Just get up at 7:00.

38:36.466 --> 38:38.234
You'll be at your boss' by 8:00.

38:38.234 --> 38:40.300
You'll be here in plenty of time for Marie's birthday.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.200
Just trust me on this.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.135
If I'm not at Devalos' before the sun is up,

38:44.135 --> 38:46.000
not only am I gonna miss Marie's birthday,

38:46.000 --> 38:47.300
but I'm going to miss yours,

38:47.300 --> 38:49.135
Ariel's, and Bridgette's.

38:58.800 --> 39:02.167
Okay, okay, do you have any idea what time it is?

39:02.700 --> 39:04.634
Nathan Hunsecker.

39:04.701 --> 39:06.900
Five years ago, you convicted him of killing his wife.

39:07.000 --> 39:07.933
Do you remember?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.300
Yes, of course.

39:09.900 --> 39:12.600
Good. Can I come in? I have a story I need to tell you.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.000
Mr. Hunsecker?

39:41.600 --> 39:44.433
Congratulations on your early release.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.200
What are you doing here?

39:46.200 --> 39:48.500
I came here to see you.

39:48.500 --> 39:50.600
I know that you're extremely angry with me.

39:50.667 --> 39:52.867
You've spent a lot of time in prison,

39:53.200 --> 39:55.900
and I'm betting that you spent some of that time thinking about me.

39:55.900 --> 39:58.400
Thinking about what you might do to me once you were released,

39:58.400 --> 40:00.033
and I can't blame you.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.400
I know now that you shouldn't have spent time in prison.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.733
I know now that you didn't kill your wife.

40:07.366 --> 40:10.867
I can't give you back the past five years of your life, sir.

40:10.900 --> 40:14.500
BUT IF YOU COME WITH ME, I believe I can give you back your good name.

40:16.800 --> 40:19.567
Your friend and attorney, Michael Gilpin,

40:20.300 --> 40:23.934
was having an affair with your wife.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.567
That's impossible.

40:27.300 --> 40:30.000
He wouldn't have done that.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.400
I've known Mike since college.

40:31.400 --> 40:32.800
He was one of my groomsmen.

40:32.800 --> 40:36.000
Mr. Hunsecker, he wasn't just having an affair with your wife.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.800
He murdered her as well.

40:41.566 --> 40:43.600
I don't believe you.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.899
This morning we found Jessamyn's body buried in Clove Lake Park.

40:47.800 --> 40:51.067
There was evidence on the body, a few hairs.

40:51.500 --> 40:55.000
Preliminary tests indicate they're a perfect match for Michael Gilpin.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.766
He already confessed to everything.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.000
I'm sorry.

41:13.700 --> 41:15.200
<i>Four...</i>

41:15.500 --> 41:17.800
Five!

41:17.800 --> 41:18.800
Ready?

41:18.800 --> 41:21.900
One, two, three, take your deep breath!

41:22.400 --> 41:23.800
Make a wish!

41:23.800 --> 41:25.666
Blow, blow!

41:28.000 --> 41:32.233
Time is priceless, yet it costs us nothing.

41:32.800 --> 41:36.700
<i>You can do anything you want with it, but you can't own it.</i>

41:38.166 --> 41:42.066
<i>You can spend it, but you can't keep it.</i>

41:43.233 --> 41:45.700
<i>And once you've lost it,</i>

41:45.700 --> 41:48.066
<i>there's no getting it back.</i>

41:49.500 --> 41:52.567
<i>It's just... gone.</i>
