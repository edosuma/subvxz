00:03.071 --> 00:05.073
JEFF: Previously on
"survivor," Ben found an idol

00:05.106 --> 00:09.977
and was playing double agent.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.512
I got to get Ashley out.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.981
My mission is to stay on the
inside of Chrissy and Ryan.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.617
JEFF: While his true
allegiance was to a core four.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.452
We don't need Joe.

00:18.486 --> 00:19.353
Done deal.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.989
JEFF: But they saw Ben as
major threat.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.024
I am considering getting Ben
out.

00:24.058 --> 00:28.996
This is a difficult decision.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.332
JEFF: At tribal council,
Ryan played his idol.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.433
It's for me.

00:32.466 --> 00:35.869
JEFF: But the core four
stuck together.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.005
11th person voted out and
the fourth member of our jury,

00:38.038 --> 00:41.075
JEFF: Stunning Ryan,
Chrissy, and Mike.

00:41.109 --> 00:46.013
Joe, the tribe has spoken.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.115
Seven are left.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.150
Who will be voted out tonight?

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.470 --> 01:10.104
Nice job, guys.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.305
Again, completely in the dark.

01:11.339 --> 01:14.041
Again I got blind sided.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.710
I just believe people when they
tell me something, and each and

01:16.744 --> 01:20.047
every time I get screwed.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.549
I'm going to get through this.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.816
I just have to figure out how.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.153
Good move, though, guys.

01:25.186 --> 01:28.021
I was fricking hoodwinked.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.056
I was just duped.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.224
Apparently Ben was with Devon,
Lauren, and Ashley.

01:30.258 --> 01:33.060
I had no idea.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.462
And I played my idol.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.596
I didn't have to.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.730
They flushed that.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.098
I'm in an awful spot right now.

01:38.132 --> 01:42.035
I have no allies except Chrissy,
who has no power.

01:42.069 --> 01:45.139
But other than that it went
really well.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.408
So can you explain what
happened tonight?

01:47.441 --> 01:50.344
Yeah, Joe went home.

01:50.378 --> 01:54.081
My plan didn't line up with your
guys' plan.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.550
And I'm not going to tell you
guys... yeah, right.

01:56.584 --> 01:59.653
I had your back since day
one.

01:59.687 --> 02:03.591
What you did today really showed
your true colors.

02:03.624 --> 02:07.595
You know what, listen to me,
anybody who goes against you,

02:07.628 --> 02:11.098
Chrissy, is all of a sudden the
bad man.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.100
Oh, my god, you're such a
jerk, Ben.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.002
I seriously never expected...

02:15.035 --> 02:16.103
You can't mother me, Chrissy.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.104
Why am I mothering you?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.539
I don't call my kids a jerk.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.908
When anybody goes against
you, you start doing this.

02:20.941 --> 02:21.675
Doing what?

02:21.709 --> 02:23.411
It's a game of "survivor."

02:23.444 --> 02:25.179
Okay, good night.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.380
Night, night.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.349
I get the fact that this is a
game.

02:28.382 --> 02:32.253
But I felt very close to Ben,
and his response was inhuman.

02:32.286 --> 02:35.122
And he wasn't even a friend
about it.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.090
He was just kind of being a
jerk.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.227
I don't know what we're going
to do.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.696
It looks like my days are
numbered, but I'm not going to

02:42.730 --> 02:43.864
roll over and die.

02:43.897 --> 02:46.467
I have to do everything I can to
make it to the end for my

02:46.500 --> 02:47.635
family.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.737
And if I get a chance to get
back at Ben, I'm going to take

02:49.770 --> 02:58.078
it.

02:58.111 --> 03:08.922
JEFF: Come on in, guys.

03:08.956 --> 03:09.957
All right.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.526
You guys ready to get to today's
reward challenge?

03:12.560 --> 03:13.661
Yeah.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.396
JEFF: It is another new
"survivor" challenge, and you

03:15.429 --> 03:17.365
will be running in pairs.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.032
Oh, wow.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.435
JEFF: But not with each
other.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.270
With your loved ones.

03:22.303 --> 03:25.205
Yes!

03:25.239 --> 03:27.441
JEFF: Ashley, let's get you
some love.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.677
Here's your dad, Jim.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.744
Come on out, Jim.

03:30.778 --> 03:34.448
Pops!

03:34.482 --> 03:36.584
I love you.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.319
Oh, my god.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.654
I talk a lot about you.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.222
You look awesome.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.692
JEFF: Ashley, one thing
that always strikes me is the

03:44.725 --> 03:48.095
way a daughter falls into the
arms of her dad.

03:48.128 --> 03:50.531
It's like no other safe spot in
the world.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.666
What is that for you right now?

03:52.700 --> 03:55.303
It's everything.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.938
I've already told every single
person behind me that he's the

03:57.971 --> 03:59.239
best man I've ever known.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.441
JEFF: Really?

04:00.474 --> 04:03.711
He's taken care of us at the
hardest times of our lives.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.846
He takes care of everyone before
he does himself.

04:05.879 --> 04:09.817
JEFF: Jim, so this really
is a father-daughter connection?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.485
Oh, no doubt about it.

04:11.519 --> 04:15.222
She's so independent and strong
and I couldn't be more proud.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.224
JEFF: Give him last
suggest.

04:17.257 --> 04:21.795
I love you so much.

04:21.829 --> 04:22.563
I love you.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.731
Love you.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.165
Oh, my god.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.867
JEFF: Ryan, who do you want
to see?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.402
My dad.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.304
JEFF: Let's get you dad out
here.

04:30.338 --> 04:42.115
Steve, come on out.

04:42.149 --> 04:45.819
I told you I'd get you here,
right?

04:45.853 --> 04:48.055
You good?

04:48.088 --> 04:48.656
Yeah?

04:48.689 --> 04:50.023
JEFF: Ryan, talk to me?

04:50.057 --> 04:51.091
Why your dad.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.794
Why is this the person you
wanted to come visit you?

04:53.827 --> 04:56.063
We watch the show together.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.164
We'd dissect the episode.

04:57.197 --> 05:01.502
I told him we could have this
moment together, and it

05:01.535 --> 05:02.135
happened.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.437
I know.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.038
It actually happened.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.807
This is my dream.

05:06.840 --> 05:11.412
Sharing this moment with my dad
is... it's the best moment of my

05:11.445 --> 05:12.179
life.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.981
JEFF: Give him a last hug,
dad.

05:14.014 --> 05:14.815
I love you.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.519
Love you, buddy.

05:18.552 --> 05:23.123
JEFF: Mike, everybody is
wondering who married you.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.626
Let's meet your wife.

05:25.659 --> 05:30.631
Mary, come on out.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.666
Mary.

05:34.067 --> 05:41.909
I love you.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.711
Oh, we've heard so much about
you.

05:43.744 --> 05:47.180
God bless you, is all I have
to say.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.048
But he's a good guy.

05:48.081 --> 05:48.649
He is.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.517
He is.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.885
JEFF: What does that feel
like, Mike?

05:51.919 --> 05:55.856
After 31 days to, have the woman
you chose next to you, what are

05:55.889 --> 05:57.458
you feeling?

05:57.491 --> 06:00.260
I mean, coming out here I
think I always knew that our

06:00.293 --> 06:03.363
love was special, but now I
really think it's one of the

06:03.397 --> 06:07.334
greatest loves of all time.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.638
And, I mean, this is the most
selfish thing I ever did, saying

06:10.671 --> 06:13.240
I'm packing up for weeks and
going on "survivor."

06:13.273 --> 06:17.344
It's the only selfish thing
he's ever done.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.112
He's never done anything for
himself ever.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.882
And she let me live my dream.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.952
JEFF: Give her a last hug.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.019
Love you.

06:26.053 --> 06:29.356
JEFF: Lauren, let's get
your sister out here.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.357
Sonny, come on out.

06:30.390 --> 06:36.296
Lauren needs some love.

06:36.329 --> 06:39.633
What?

06:39.667 --> 06:40.534
JEFF: Wow.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.135
35 seasons I get a hug.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.438
I still love you.

06:44.472 --> 06:50.644
I missed you, too.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.345
JEFF: You guys are clearly
sisters.

06:52.379 --> 06:55.215
No other woman would come out
and grab her sister's stomach

06:55.248 --> 06:57.751
and say, hey, losing some
weight.

06:57.785 --> 07:01.522
We're like night and day.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.890
We have the same dad.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.926
We grew up in two different
household, but I'm actually

07:05.959 --> 07:07.661
living her dream.

07:07.695 --> 07:08.361
JEFF: How so?

07:08.395 --> 07:09.763
She's a huge "survivor" fan.

07:09.797 --> 07:13.634
She begged me for two weeks the
try out at an open casting call.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.704
We went together, and I made it
and she didn't, but this is a

07:16.737 --> 07:22.109
huge thing for her, and I feel
like her being here, it will

07:22.142 --> 07:26.714
make us closer and we can depend
on each other more from here on

07:26.747 --> 07:27.214
out.

07:27.247 --> 07:27.981
JEFF: All right.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.449
Give her last hug.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.284
JEFF: Chrissy, how long
have you been married?

07:31.318 --> 07:32.653
Almost 20 years.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.287
JEFF: Shall we get you
husband out here?

07:34.321 --> 07:35.088
Yes!

07:35.122 --> 07:45.165
JEFF: Keith, come on out.

07:45.165 --> 07:52.072
JEFF: Keith, come on out.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.176
[[INAUDIBLE]
Chrissy, what is the feeling

07:56.209 --> 07:59.847
right now, knowing this is
somebody you know you can trust?

07:59.880 --> 08:04.652
When you're out here for 31
days, you just get broken.

08:04.685 --> 08:08.288
We're tired, we're starving,
we're dirty, and then someone

08:08.321 --> 08:13.393
comes out who you know you
just... he's my everything.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.529
He's my everything.

08:15.563 --> 08:18.398
JEFF: Chrissy, on the rare
moments when you're able to not

08:18.431 --> 08:21.434
think about the game and you're
able to try to put your life

08:21.468 --> 08:25.405
back home in perspective, have
you reevaluated your life at

08:25.438 --> 08:25.906
all?

08:25.939 --> 08:28.709
Yes, definitely.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.979
The last few years I've just
gotten so caught up in work that

08:32.011 --> 08:36.416
I think I've just turned away
and all I want to do when I get

08:36.448 --> 08:41.054
home is just devote the rest of
my life to my family, and I have

08:41.087 --> 08:42.655
the most incredible family.

08:42.690 --> 08:46.226
I mean, this is the most
incredible man I've ever known.

08:46.259 --> 08:50.063
JEFF: Chrissy, I don't
think I've seen you smile like

08:50.097 --> 08:51.364
this for 31 days.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.365
Maybe yesterday.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.535
I won immunity yesterday.

08:55.569 --> 09:00.073
JEFF: An we're back to the
game.

09:00.107 --> 09:00.941
[LAUGHTER]
All right.

09:00.974 --> 09:06.780
Give her a last good-bye.

09:06.814 --> 09:10.217
JEFF: Devon, who do you
want to see?

09:10.250 --> 09:12.352
Me and my mom, please.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.553
JEFF: Okay.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.355
Sonya, come on out.

09:15.388 --> 09:30.237
Devon needs some love.

09:30.270 --> 09:39.246
I'm so happy to see you.

09:39.279 --> 09:45.853
You look beautiful.

09:45.886 --> 09:49.589
JEFF: This is so beautiful
to watch.

09:49.623 --> 09:53.627
Is it possible, Devon, to
explain to your mom what it's

09:53.661 --> 09:56.263
like out here when you don't
have that foundation of love and

09:56.296 --> 09:58.198
trust and support?

09:58.231 --> 10:03.771
It just makes you realize
what's really important in life,

10:03.804 --> 10:07.908
and I just realize that every
day that I spend away from you

10:07.941 --> 10:13.013
and the family feels like a day
wasted.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.214
Really.

10:14.247 --> 10:17.617
It's a lucky day for whoever
gets to be with you, honey.

10:17.651 --> 10:18.451
JEFF: All right.

10:18.485 --> 10:26.259
Give him a last hug.

10:26.293 --> 10:30.363
That a boy, Dev.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.332
JEFF: Ben, you ready the
see you wife?

10:32.365 --> 10:32.966
Yes, sir.

10:33.000 --> 10:43.576
JEFF: Kelly, come on out.

10:43.610 --> 10:47.480
You smell so good.

10:47.514 --> 10:56.356
You're so beautiful.

10:56.389 --> 10:56.990
How are the kids?

10:57.024 --> 10:58.792
Good, good, good.

10:58.826 --> 10:59.793
Everybody's good.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.895
JEFF: Ben, I heard you ask,
are the kids good?

11:01.929 --> 11:03.630
Is that most what's on your
mind?

11:03.663 --> 11:08.168
Her, my season and my
daughter are why I'm out here,

11:08.201 --> 11:10.537
because I'm doing this all for
them, you know?

11:10.570 --> 11:13.340
I'm the richest man ever just
because I have them three.

11:13.373 --> 11:17.477
You know, coming back as a
veteran, you just go true a. Of

11:17.510 --> 11:21.514
emotions and depression and I
had one foot in the gave.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.217
And she picked me up and gave me
life.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.586
You know, I'm here.

11:26.619 --> 11:27.755
I'm on the earth because of her.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.123
DREW: Kelly, what's this
moment like for you, to be out

11:30.157 --> 11:30.557
here?

11:30.590 --> 11:32.659
Oh, amazing.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.526
Amazing.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.629
It feels so good to be next to
him again.

11:36.663 --> 11:39.399
Without him around it's a big
hole in our world.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.433
JEFF: How old are the kids?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.870
Five and three.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.437
JEFF: So they're little.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.908
They're real little, and I'm
missioning them a bunch.

11:47.941 --> 11:48.541
JEFF: All right.

11:48.575 --> 11:49.943
Give him a last hug.

11:49.977 --> 11:50.944
I love you.

11:50.978 --> 11:55.883
JEFF: I love you, honey.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.417
[APPLAUSE]
JEFF: All right.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.252
Well, a hug is nice.

11:59.286 --> 12:04.657
But you've come this far, you
want the full experience.

12:04.691 --> 12:08.161
The only way the guarantee that
you get quality time with your

12:08.195 --> 12:14.734
loved ones is if you are really
in sync with them.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.336
You're each going to have bag.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.572
Inside the bag are two marbles,
one black and one white.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.241
You're each going to draw a
marble.

12:21.274 --> 12:24.011
If they match, you stay alive.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.478
If they don't, you're out.

12:25.512 --> 12:26.446
It's do or die.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.648
The last couple left standings
wins reward.

12:28.681 --> 12:32.119
You will take your loved one
back the camp while you have a

12:32.152 --> 12:33.420
"survivor" barbecue.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.054
Worth playing for?

12:34.087 --> 12:34.721
Yes, sir.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.588
JEFF: All right.

12:35.622 --> 12:38.425
I'll pass out the bags.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.460
Don't open them yet.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.028
Everybody good?

12:41.061 --> 12:42.562
Yes.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.196
JEFF: All right.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.164
Here we go.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.498
Lauren, you're up first.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.601
Open your bag, reach your hand
in, you're going to pick one

12:48.635 --> 12:51.271
marble and pull it out, and then
your sister will try to match

12:51.304 --> 12:53.306
you.

12:53.340 --> 12:58.545
Lauren has a white marble.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.579
Sonny draws black.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.949
No match.

13:01.982 --> 13:05.185
Just like that, Lauren has no
control in this game.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.419
All right.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.988
Mike, open your bag.

13:08.021 --> 13:08.655
Reach in.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.591
Pull out one marble.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.193
Mike draws white.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.228
All right.

13:15.262 --> 13:15.562
Barry.

13:15.595 --> 13:16.196
Black.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.331
No match for Mike and Barry.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.532
All right.

13:19.566 --> 13:23.436
Ryan, we're still looking for
our first loved one match.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.473
Ryan picks black.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.441
Dad draws white.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.277
Another no match.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.445
Ryan is devastated.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.146
All right.

13:33.180 --> 13:33.847
Ryan have, a spot.

13:33.881 --> 13:34.948
This is how "survivor" goes.

13:34.982 --> 13:39.319
All right, Ben, reach in and
draw one marble.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.989
Ben draws black.

13:42.022 --> 13:45.458
Kelly, you're up.

13:45.492 --> 13:49.629
Ben and Kelly are our first
loved ones matched.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.597
They stay alive.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.901
They have a shot at guaranteeing
love.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.569
Chrissy, you're up.

13:56.603 --> 14:00.773
Chrissy draws black.

14:00.807 --> 14:01.541
And it is black.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.076
We have another match.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.378
Chrissy and Keith are still
alive.

14:05.412 --> 14:08.381
Now we move to Ashley.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.617
Ashley draws black.

14:10.650 --> 14:11.118
White.

14:11.151 --> 14:16.089
No match for Ashley.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.357
Devon, white, a white marble.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.226
All right, sonya.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.293
Black.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.129
Sonya and Devon are out.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.097
Devon, take a spot on the log.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.533
Sonya take a spot on the log.

14:26.566 --> 14:31.504
And now in typical "survivor"
fashion, we have a showdown.

14:31.538 --> 14:37.277
Ben and his wife, Chrissy and
her husband, let's get it on.

14:37.310 --> 14:42.950
Ben, you're up.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.985
Ben draws black.

14:45.018 --> 14:48.788
Hands are shaking literally,
fingers can barely hold on to

14:48.821 --> 14:49.756
that marble.

14:49.789 --> 14:50.690
Kelly has the match.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.325
She does not.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.828
Chrissy and Keith have to match
to win.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.830
Otherwise we have another round.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.032
Chrissy, the door is open.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.500
Ben and Kelly didn't match.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.670
If you match your husband, you
win love.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.538
You're in control.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.208
Chrissy draws white.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.978
Keith, when you're ready.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.780
White means Chrissy and Keith
are in control of love.

15:13.813 --> 15:18.185
Black means we do another round.

15:18.218 --> 15:18.986
White!

15:19.019 --> 15:20.520
Chrissy and Keith match.

15:20.553 --> 15:28.996
Give him a hug.

15:29.029 --> 15:29.829
We won.

15:29.862 --> 15:34.867
JEFF: Chrissy, Keith, come
on over.

15:34.901 --> 15:35.435
All right.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.369
So here's the deal.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.804
Chrissy and Keith, you're in
charge of love.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.672
You're going back the camp.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.874
And can we bring a friend?

15:41.908 --> 15:42.942
JEFF: You're going to bring
a friend.

15:42.976 --> 15:46.613
Pick one "survivor" and their
loved one to show you.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.516
Ryan and Steve.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.917
JEFF: You didn't even
hesitates.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.120
JEFF: Come on over.

15:53.153 --> 15:57.924
Thank you so much.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.927
JEFF: Choose one more
American and their one to join

16:00.960 --> 16:03.930
you back at camp for a
once-in-a-lifetime experience.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.599
Dr. Mike and Barry.

16:06.633 --> 16:10.937
JEFF: Dr. Mike and Barry,
come on over.

16:10.970 --> 16:11.704
Thank you.

16:11.738 --> 16:12.872
Thank you.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.408
JEFF: Chrissy, you have one
spot left at the "survivor"

16:15.442 --> 16:15.975
barbecue.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.810
Who is your last choice?

16:17.844 --> 16:19.746
Ashley and Jim.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.815
JEFF: No hesitation once
again.

16:22.849 --> 16:27.854
Like an assassin.

16:27.887 --> 16:28.821
All right.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.424
Guys, time to say good-bye.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.859
Nine days, baby.

16:32.892 --> 16:33.893
Hang in there.

16:33.926 --> 16:34.761
You can do it.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.329
Bye.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.798
JEFF: Chrissy, because of
you, you guys are all going back

16:38.831 --> 16:40.333
the camp.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.201
Once-in-a-lifetime experience.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.902
Ben, Lauren, Devon, got nothing
for you.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.472
Grab your stuff, head back,
enjoy the afternoon.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.508
Poor Ben picked the wrong
time to pick a fight with me,

16:48.541 --> 16:52.345
because he did not get to see
his sweet Kelly.

16:52.379 --> 16:55.115
And now I'm going the make sure
he regrets that he ever crossed

16:55.148 --> 16:57.150
me.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.702
You have an ant on your...
There are so many ants here

17:15.734 --> 17:16.403
you have no idea.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.338
How many ants have you eaten?

17:18.371 --> 17:19.539
Hundreds.

17:19.571 --> 17:24.676
I have not been aligned with
Mike at all, but as of last

17:24.711 --> 17:27.012
night, he's at the bottom, and
us two are at the bottom.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.917
Where does Ashley stand with
the other three?

17:30.950 --> 17:32.152
That's her group.

17:32.185 --> 17:35.288
The reason I picked Ashley is I
felt like Ashley would be the

17:35.322 --> 17:42.028
easiest of the four to break.

17:42.061 --> 17:46.433
It's a long shot, but if I can
bring just one person over to

17:46.466 --> 17:49.269
our side, then we have the
majority in numbers and can

17:49.302 --> 17:51.871
criminal the next vote.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.039
...can control the next vote.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.708
You want a four-person
alliance right now with three

17:55.742 --> 17:57.043
people that will take your
million dollars.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.980
Your alliance now is like
powerhouses.

18:01.013 --> 18:04.884
So just give some thought as to
if the three of us can help you

18:04.917 --> 18:07.086
get rid of your competition.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.156
Uh-huh.

18:09.189 --> 18:09.789
Who are you thinking about?

18:09.822 --> 18:11.824
Ben.

18:11.858 --> 18:15.027
He's physical, social, he's
fought for our country in Iraq.

18:15.061 --> 18:18.064
That's true.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.334
Of course Chrissy is going to
say anything she can to get

18:21.368 --> 18:23.770
another number on her side, but
it is interesting, because she

18:23.803 --> 18:25.472
might be right.

18:25.505 --> 18:29.342
Both alliances know that Ben is
a huge threat at the end, so do

18:29.376 --> 18:32.879
I just go ahead and initiate
that right now to be able to say

18:32.912 --> 18:34.447
I made a big move?

18:34.481 --> 18:48.295
That's the question.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.063
Ryan played an idol at
tribal.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.600
Traditionally once an idol is
played, one comes back into the

18:53.633 --> 18:54.801
game.

18:54.834 --> 18:58.705
With that one coming back into
the game, we need to find it.

18:58.738 --> 19:04.043
So I decided to make a fake idol
and I'm going to plant that

19:04.076 --> 19:06.846
somewhere while I'm looking for
the real idol.

19:06.879 --> 19:12.619
Fake immunity necklace, real
immunity necklace.

19:12.652 --> 19:17.290
If Chrissy, Mike, or Ryan find
this fake idol, they'll stop

19:17.324 --> 19:20.059
looking, and that will give us
more time the look for the real

19:20.092 --> 19:22.662
one.

19:22.695 --> 19:26.533
I took that piece of string
and all my shells and made an

19:26.566 --> 19:26.966
idol out of it.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.903
Oh, my god.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.505
Dude, you did a good job.

19:32.539 --> 19:36.409
Ben made his own idol, and it
look really legit.

19:36.443 --> 19:38.478
Turns out Ben's pretty crafty.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.746
I'm impressed, Ben.

19:39.779 --> 19:43.049
You have a lot of work to do,
the fake idol and searching for

19:43.082 --> 19:44.150
the idol.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.153
Ben's got this fake idol, but
what is it going to do?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.688
Who is it going to benefit?

19:48.721 --> 19:53.893
I hope Chrissy finds that
damn fake adoll.

19:53.926 --> 19:57.063
He wants Chrissy to give that
fake idol and watch Jeff throw

19:57.096 --> 19:58.865
it in the fire and just
embarrass herself.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.701
That's just because he has a
personal thing against Chrissy,

20:01.734 --> 20:04.637
and that's my problem with Ben.

20:04.671 --> 20:11.944
He's taking all these factors to
the personal level.

20:11.978 --> 20:12.912
Hey, I got it.

20:12.945 --> 20:13.580
I got it.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.080
Come here.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.383
I got it right here.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.984
Yes, you walked right by it.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.185
It said dig.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.888
No, way!

20:21.921 --> 20:24.491
I found half of a hidden
immunity idol.

20:24.524 --> 20:27.193
Now you just need to secure the
other half at next immunity

20:27.226 --> 20:28.261
challenge.

20:28.295 --> 20:31.998
There will be a seashell in
front of your platform.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.001
This is the other half of your
idol.

20:35.034 --> 20:38.037
But one without the other has no
power at all.

20:38.070 --> 20:42.642
At this point the only part I
have is a leather string.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.778
So at the next immunity
challenge, I have to get that

20:45.812 --> 20:47.814
shell to make it complete for it
to be in play.

21:06.265 --> 21:14.240
JEFF: Come on in, guys.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.141
All right.

21:15.174 --> 21:18.244
Shall we get to today's immunity
challenge?

21:18.277 --> 21:21.180
JEFF: Chrissy, first things
first, got to take back the

21:21.213 --> 21:21.881
necklace.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.083
You're not going to help at all.

21:24.116 --> 21:24.417
Nope.

21:24.451 --> 21:28.020
Thank you.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.222
Once again immunity is back up
for grabs.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.692
For today's challenge you're
going to have your arms

21:32.725 --> 21:35.562
stretched out with your
fingertips pressed against two

21:35.595 --> 21:39.265
wooden disks.

21:39.298 --> 21:43.102
If at any point your disks drop,
you're out of the challenge.

21:43.135 --> 21:47.807
Last person left standing wins
immunity, guaranteed a one in

21:47.840 --> 21:50.643
six shot at getting to the end.

21:50.677 --> 21:53.480
Losers tribal council where
somebody will become the fifth

21:53.513 --> 21:55.047
member of our jury.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.115
Take your spots.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.585
We'll get started.

21:58.618 --> 22:07.794
It's going to hurt.

22:07.827 --> 22:08.961
All right.

22:08.995 --> 22:15.067
Everybody is in position, and
this challenge is on.

22:15.101 --> 22:18.438
This will hurt.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.539
Will?

22:19.572 --> 22:20.507
JEFF: All right hurting?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.975
It already hurts.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.477
Ing in feels good right now.

22:24.511 --> 22:29.115
JEFF: Each of these
stations made specifically for

22:29.148 --> 22:37.890
you, and the dance begins,
bodies start to shift,

22:37.924 --> 22:40.026
repositioning, a little slip
from Chrissy.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.061
That chime represents hope.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.330
You want the hear those things
clanging.

22:44.363 --> 22:49.402
Because when those disks drop,
those chimes stop, and you're

22:49.436 --> 22:54.474
out.

22:54.507 --> 22:59.145
One of the hottest days so far
here in Fiji that.

22:59.178 --> 23:06.886
Sun pounding down.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.588
Ryan moving his disks around.

23:08.621 --> 23:09.656
Ben now repositioning.

23:09.689 --> 23:13.993
A big stretch from Ben.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.127
More movement by Chrissy.

23:15.161 --> 23:24.671
She digs inch Ben readjusting
again.

23:24.704 --> 23:25.972
Ryan dropping again.

23:26.005 --> 23:29.208
Very close to the edge of death.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.244
Chrissy now starting to drop.

23:32.278 --> 23:36.115
There is nobody that is not
hurting.

23:36.148 --> 23:36.749
Ryan moving.

23:36.783 --> 23:37.984
A lot of people moving now.

23:38.017 --> 23:41.087
We're reaching that critical
spot where people will start to

23:41.120 --> 23:42.021
drop.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.856
You don't want it to be you.

23:43.890 --> 23:48.427
You have to dig in right now.

23:48.461 --> 23:50.730
Ben all over the place slipping.

23:50.763 --> 23:51.998
More movement.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.099
Another nice recovery.

23:53.132 --> 23:56.335
More movement from Ben.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.571
Ben is fighting to stay in this.

23:58.605 --> 24:03.476
And recovers again.

24:03.510 --> 24:08.548
Ryan moving again.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.182
Ben cannot hang in any longer.

24:10.216 --> 24:11.818
Ben is the first one out.

24:11.851 --> 24:17.356
We are down to six.

24:17.389 --> 24:18.157
Chrissy drops.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.125
Chrissy is now out.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.693
No shot at immunity.

24:20.727 --> 24:23.596
And we are down to five.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.499
Ryan with another nice recovery.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.568
Stretched to your limit.

24:28.601 --> 24:29.235
Ryan drops.

24:29.268 --> 24:29.969
He's out.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.872
We're down to four.

24:32.905 --> 24:38.177
Devon, Ashley, Mike, and Lauren.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.111
Mike now with movement.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.980
Go ahead, Mike.

24:41.013 --> 24:44.517
Drop it, drop it, Mike.

24:44.551 --> 24:49.288
Never!

24:49.321 --> 24:52.191
JEFF: Lauren just quits.

24:52.224 --> 24:53.459
Didn't even drop.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.460
I can't.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.629
My shoulders are done.

24:56.663 --> 24:57.564
JEFF: Lauren is out.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.732
You can take a seat on your
platform.

24:59.766 --> 25:02.769
An we are down to three.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.804
Devon, Ashley, and Mike.

25:27.493 --> 25:33.099
No way you could have dreamed it
would hurt this much.

25:33.132 --> 25:38.237
Movement from Ashley for the
first time in this challenge.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.706
Hula.

25:39.739 --> 25:40.940
Do the hula.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.442
JEFF: Devon doing a nice
little hula?

25:43.475 --> 25:45.612
Yeah.

25:45.645 --> 25:51.818
Got to make some fun of this,
because this sucks.

25:51.851 --> 25:54.120
JEFF: Mike drops and we are
down to two.

25:54.153 --> 26:00.226
It is Devon and Ashley, side by
side, fighting for immunity.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.962
Do you want to just fight it
out?

26:02.995 --> 26:05.064
What do you think?

26:05.097 --> 26:07.366
JEFF: Devon, why are you
bringing this up?

26:07.399 --> 26:10.402
Because it sounds like you kind
of want to have it be over?

26:10.436 --> 26:14.641
Ashley and I, it's known
across this whole tribe, that we

26:14.674 --> 26:17.777
are strong allies, and either
one of us wearing that necklace

26:17.810 --> 26:19.178
is just as good in my eyes.

26:19.211 --> 26:22.281
DREW: Wow, Ben, that is a
bold statement on day 33.

26:22.314 --> 26:27.887
Yeah, you know, it comes down
to being comfortable in your

26:27.920 --> 26:28.655
alliance.

26:28.688 --> 26:34.827
Shoulder massages for the
loser?

26:34.861 --> 26:35.795
All right.

26:35.828 --> 26:36.162
Massage?

26:36.195 --> 26:37.296
Massage.

26:37.329 --> 26:40.767
JEFF: Devon negotiates his
way out of the challenge.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.871
Ashley wins individual immunity.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.673
Oh, my god.

26:46.706 --> 26:50.276
JEFF: Ashley, come on over.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.078
I can't feel my fingers,
Jeff.

26:52.111 --> 26:52.779
JEFF: Totally numb?

26:52.812 --> 26:53.946
Oh, yeah.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.315
JEFF: Ashley once again
safe tonight at tribal council.

26:56.348 --> 26:57.750
Cannot be voted out of this
game.

26:57.784 --> 27:01.220
As for the rest of you, after 33
very, very tough days, somebody

27:01.253 --> 27:05.591
going home tonight, will become
the fifth member of our jury.

27:05.624 --> 27:05.992
Congrats.

27:06.025 --> 27:06.926
Thank you.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.596
Picking up the shell
completed the idol.

27:10.629 --> 27:16.168
So with seven of us and four of
us voting the same way, so case

27:16.202 --> 27:17.603
closed.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.838
Ryan going home.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.119
Way to go.

27:33.152 --> 27:33.886
Good job, Ashley.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.321
Nice job Devon also.

27:35.354 --> 27:38.624
You were right there.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.928
I had a feeling you were
going to win anyway, so I was

27:41.961 --> 27:43.629
like, might as well get down.

27:43.662 --> 27:47.133
Having the immunity necklace
at tribal will feel amazing.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.600
I see myself in a great
position.

27:48.634 --> 27:51.503
I have an alliance that I can
trust, and we have the numbers,

27:51.537 --> 27:55.374
but I realized I may not have
that many big moves on my

27:55.407 --> 27:59.411
resume, and for me to win this
game, I got to get rid of the

27:59.445 --> 28:03.649
stronger players.

28:03.682 --> 28:08.020
I've gone back and forth on
wanting to do this.

28:08.054 --> 28:08.721
Should we just get rid of Ben?

28:08.755 --> 28:11.657
Honestly I'm leaning toward Ben.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.560
I think Chrissy is more of a
challenge threat than Ben?

28:14.593 --> 28:18.530
Well, if they're both going,
I just wish we would vote Ben

28:18.564 --> 28:19.365
out first.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.200
Ashley still wants to vote
out Ben.

28:21.233 --> 28:24.636
She sees him being the biggest
threat in this game.

28:24.670 --> 28:27.573
But I see Chrissy being a
threat, too.

28:27.606 --> 28:31.944
Due the challenge capabilities
and being someone who the jury

28:31.978 --> 28:35.614
might want to see win the
million dollars in the end.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.985
I say Chrissy before Ben, but I
agree with you that Ben should

28:39.018 --> 28:44.123
go.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.324
Oh, man.

28:45.357 --> 28:49.762
I came up on the well and I
see Devon, Ashley, and Lauren

28:49.796 --> 28:50.997
talking under their breath.

28:51.030 --> 28:54.433
I heard my name, and then they
seen me coming and they stopped

28:54.466 --> 28:55.267
talking.

28:55.301 --> 29:02.408
The whole thing was really
suspicious.

29:02.441 --> 29:03.609
Is everything all good?

29:03.642 --> 29:08.514
Yeah.

29:08.547 --> 29:13.652
So who is do you want the see
go?

29:13.685 --> 29:14.553
Chrissy.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.055
Fine with me.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.891
Something is definitely going
on around here.

29:18.925 --> 29:21.560
They're saying it's Chrissy, but
I feel like there is a chance

29:21.593 --> 29:23.162
that it's going to be me.

29:23.195 --> 29:26.866
So I got to do whatever I have
to do to keep myself in the

29:26.899 --> 29:30.636
game.

29:30.669 --> 29:33.505
I'm getting paranoid.

29:33.539 --> 29:38.177
I feel like we're very close.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.080
And Lauren in on that.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.015
So are you willing to make a big
move with me?

29:43.049 --> 29:46.218
I'm always willing to make a
big move, you know that.

29:46.252 --> 29:49.989
Well, during the family
visit, Lauren found the idol.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.891
It was a two-part idol.

29:51.924 --> 29:55.627
One of it was aer cord, and then
the other part was at the

29:55.661 --> 29:58.597
challenge today, that seashell
she picked up.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.665
That is an idol.

29:59.698 --> 30:02.368
So she is too powerful in this
game right now.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.470
She has an idol and an extra
vote.

30:04.503 --> 30:08.174
I thought it was through, but
Lauren has all these advantages,

30:08.207 --> 30:10.709
so Ben wants to get rid of her.

30:10.742 --> 30:13.545
And all of a sudden I feel like
I'm back on top.

30:13.579 --> 30:16.615
So never underestimate Dr. Mike.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.716
So let's think about this.

30:17.749 --> 30:22.088
We got Chrissy and you, right?

30:22.121 --> 30:23.055
Me and then Mike.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.156
That's four versus three.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.357
And she goes home.

30:25.391 --> 30:26.758
So what do you think, dude?

30:26.792 --> 30:27.426
Okay.

30:27.459 --> 30:28.427
Trust me on this.

30:28.460 --> 30:29.695
Okay.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.130
I was shocked.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.498
Ben wants the vote out Lauren.

30:32.531 --> 30:36.635
Now he was very vague, but
that's all I needed to hear,

30:36.668 --> 30:39.305
because as long as the target is
not on me, I'm down.

30:39.338 --> 30:44.010
The problem is, for this to
work, we need Chrissy, who hates

30:44.043 --> 30:45.111
Ben.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.813
Here's the thing, I don't
want it to be me tonight.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.181
I know.

30:49.215 --> 30:51.150
If you can just hear me out.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.285
Yeah.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.021
There are big threats in this
game.

30:55.054 --> 30:56.322
I'll give you that.

30:56.355 --> 31:00.759
Okay.

31:00.792 --> 31:03.896
Chrissy voting Devon?

31:03.930 --> 31:07.099
Devon, why do you think I
would tell you anything about

31:07.133 --> 31:09.335
our conversation considering
what happened at the last tribal

31:09.368 --> 31:10.502
council?

31:10.536 --> 31:12.104
I was trying the talk to
Chrissy, and she just blew me

31:12.138 --> 31:13.205
off.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.674
She's holding a grudge in this
game, and taking it too

31:15.707 --> 31:16.475
personal.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.544
Half of me was like, screw it.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.012
I have an idol.

31:20.046 --> 31:24.216
On the other hand, I'd rather
save it for the five, and to do

31:24.250 --> 31:25.985
that, I'm going to need Chrissy.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.186
All right.

31:27.219 --> 31:30.622
I'm sorry if I offended you in
any way, but moving forward, I

31:30.656 --> 31:32.824
still want to work with you in
this game.

31:32.858 --> 31:36.662
Ben, I have been totally
blind sided at the last two

31:36.695 --> 31:36.996
tribals.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.164
Right.

31:38.197 --> 31:41.133
You have given academy
award-winning performances, and

31:41.167 --> 31:43.936
now I look back and realize the
thing was a total sham.

31:43.970 --> 31:48.274
You can vote whichever way
you want to, but Lauren has an

31:48.307 --> 31:49.608
extra vote.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.343
Lauren also has an immunity
idol.

31:51.377 --> 31:52.778
She has too much power in the
game.

31:52.811 --> 31:56.949
I was ready to go to tribal
and vote for Ben, but, oh, my

31:56.983 --> 32:00.252
god, if by voting out Lauren
that will keep me safe, I have

32:00.286 --> 32:02.221
to consider it.

32:02.254 --> 32:06.658
If we get Lauren out, me,
you, Ryan and Mike will have

32:06.692 --> 32:07.493
control of the game.

32:07.526 --> 32:08.160
Okay.

32:08.194 --> 32:09.495
We're back in it together.

32:09.528 --> 32:10.096
Okay.

32:10.129 --> 32:10.862
Thank you, Ben.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.331
I'm going to go this way.

32:12.364 --> 32:12.931
Okay.

32:12.965 --> 32:14.166
I'm going to go back.

32:14.200 --> 32:17.203
The problem is for six days
Ben has lied to me and used me,

32:17.236 --> 32:22.241
so how am I supposed to trust
him knowing that he might just

32:22.274 --> 32:25.344
come back to camp and say, ha,
ha, I duped you again.

32:25.377 --> 32:29.615
I know you're mad at Ben, and
so am I, but if we can blindside

32:29.648 --> 32:33.152
somebody with an idol and an
extra vote, that's a huge plus.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.520
This game is so hard.

32:34.553 --> 32:35.454
I know.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.223
Right now I'm leaning toward
voting Ben.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.591
Chrissy won't commit to
taking out Lauren.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.960
This is vengeance more than
anything else.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.996
She's playing emotionally at
this point.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.731
And I don't know what's going to
happen tonight.

32:45.764 --> 32:52.838
So it's "survivor" rule number
two, have a plan "b."

32:52.871 --> 32:54.273
What did he tell you?

32:54.306 --> 32:56.975
Things you haven't told me.

32:57.009 --> 33:02.981
Idols, advantages, and Lauren
has to go.

33:03.015 --> 33:05.117
What?

33:05.151 --> 33:07.086
Wow.

33:07.119 --> 33:11.457
Things are getting crazy.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.559
Ben is trying the blind side
you.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.294
Apparently he's told earn about
everything.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.729
He told Chrissy about the
idol.

33:17.763 --> 33:18.830
And you advantage.

33:18.864 --> 33:21.767
I just heard that Ben is
trying the blind side me.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.335
I'm like, what the hell is going
on.

33:23.369 --> 33:27.806
So you know, I have that extra
vote, but first I want to see if

33:27.839 --> 33:30.809
I can't get the numbers back on
my side.

33:30.842 --> 33:34.046
Here, you can have the other
half of that.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.816
That's the part I got today.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.351
Thank you.

33:39.385 --> 33:43.389
Lauren gave me a piece of the
idol to say, look, I trust you.

33:43.422 --> 33:47.926
And it falls into those like
stupidest moves ever in

33:47.959 --> 33:49.195
"survivor" history.

33:49.228 --> 33:52.731
And the only question is do the
"survivor" gods make her pay for

33:52.764 --> 33:54.766
it or not.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.520
JEFF: We now bring in the
members of our jury.

34:14.553 --> 34:27.032
Desi, Cole, j.P., and Joe voted
out at the last tribal council.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.168
So let's start with today's
immunity challenge.

34:30.202 --> 34:33.605
Devon and Ashley were very up
front about saying, we're a

34:33.639 --> 34:36.041
pair, everybody knows it, in
fact, they negotiated a deal.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.043
Devon stepped down in exchange
for a shoulder rub.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.344
Ashley wins immunity.

34:39.378 --> 34:40.279
Nobody seemed to mind.

34:40.312 --> 34:42.813
Jeff, let me clear things up.

34:42.848 --> 34:47.052
I was just sending my message of
trust to my alliance.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.322
It wouldn't have mattered if it
was Lauren or Ashley.

34:50.356 --> 34:52.056
I thought I was part of that,
too.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.627
So not hearing my name in that
is kind of concerning.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.996
JEFF: Ashley, your eyes are
huge.

34:58.029 --> 35:00.699
Yeah, Jeff, it's safe the say
that the pressure of this game

35:00.732 --> 35:02.501
is getting to some people.

35:02.534 --> 35:05.504
And now people that were at the
bottom are maybe safe tonight

35:05.537 --> 35:09.275
and people that could have been
very safe are potentially not.

35:09.308 --> 35:10.476
JEFF: Okay.

35:10.509 --> 35:14.646
Because of what Ben said, the
only thing I could deduce from

35:14.680 --> 35:15.747
that cryptic answer is Ben.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.349
I'd say you heard that right.

35:17.383 --> 35:20.886
You know what, then let's get
the playing the game.

35:20.919 --> 35:25.123
What, what part of a game
move was you telling people

35:25.157 --> 35:26.158
about the idol?

35:26.192 --> 35:27.259
Where was that a game move?

35:27.293 --> 35:28.894
That was part of my game.

35:28.927 --> 35:31.597
We got a game for you, too,
so go ahead.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.065
That's what I meant by
messing up your own game,

35:34.099 --> 35:36.302
exactly, because you've been
paranoid.

35:36.335 --> 35:39.037
If you're in an alliance, you
need to have trust with that

35:39.070 --> 35:40.138
alliance.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.007
Like at the well when you
senators should expect off

35:42.040 --> 35:43.209
whispering.

35:43.242 --> 35:46.278
We're not whispering, and you
trying to portray me has not

35:46.312 --> 35:47.213
really got you anywhere.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.047
I was definitely gunning for
you today.

35:49.080 --> 35:52.418
Well, I hope you got a lot of
ammunition.

35:52.451 --> 35:53.819
JEFF: Wow.

35:53.852 --> 35:54.986
It's on.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.888
Well, I think one of the
reasons that Lauren became the

35:56.922 --> 36:00.125
target is because Lauren has the
advantage that allows her an

36:00.158 --> 36:01.227
extra vote.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.329
I personally would recommend
that you just forfeit the

36:03.362 --> 36:06.232
advantage and give it to Jeff...

36:06.265 --> 36:07.733
It's been ripped up.

36:07.766 --> 36:08.434
The advantage was...

36:08.467 --> 36:09.901
You ripped the advantage of.

36:09.935 --> 36:11.637
We're not talking about the
idol.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.871
You still have the advantage.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.139
The advantage is at camp.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.941
I have to physically have it
here.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.976
So right now you cannot use
the advantage.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.010
I cannot use the advantage.

36:19.044 --> 36:22.548
So theoretically we could
vote 4-3 against you.

36:22.581 --> 36:25.951
Do whatever you all feel the
need to do.

36:25.984 --> 36:28.987
JEFF: So I'm still unclear
on the idol.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.190
Because it sounds like everybody
knows everything.

36:32.224 --> 36:34.593
It doesn't sound like there are
any secrets.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.328
He has part of it.

36:36.362 --> 36:42.167
But mind you, you have Ben back
there who is plan was to take

36:42.200 --> 36:44.102
his fake idol and give it to
Chrissy.

36:44.135 --> 36:46.872
I took the fake idol out of
play because I didn't want to be

36:46.905 --> 36:48.840
a personal attack against
Chrissy.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.008
Whoa now.

36:50.041 --> 36:53.579
As far as fake idols go,
that's a pretty darn good fake

36:53.612 --> 36:54.813
idol.

36:54.846 --> 36:58.384
This is the real idol, and I
wanted to do this for like 15

36:58.417 --> 37:11.997
years, it will never be played.

37:12.030 --> 37:15.934
JEFF: Mike, very interested
you decided, we don't want

37:15.967 --> 37:20.171
idols, we don't want advantages,
but you're tempting the

37:20.205 --> 37:22.207
"survivor" gods when you have
the most valuable thing in the

37:22.240 --> 37:25.544
game and you throw it in the
fire willingly, what's the

37:25.577 --> 37:26.678
reasoning behind that?

37:26.712 --> 37:29.415
An idol Anderson advantage is
a blessing and a curse.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.783
So people are shunning them and
trying to get rid of them.

37:31.817 --> 37:34.219
But the curse he mentions is
because other people have known

37:34.252 --> 37:34.953
about it.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.588
That's what's been exposed
today.

37:36.622 --> 37:42.093
Jeff, here's what's people
ARE SAYING AT HOME: Don't reveal

37:42.127 --> 37:43.495
you have an idol or an
advantage.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.631
The extra vote is not being
played.

37:45.664 --> 37:49.167
You have to understand that
it's really hard once we get to

37:49.200 --> 37:49.635
six...

37:49.668 --> 37:50.469
Do you want it?

37:50.502 --> 37:52.338
You can have it
give it to Chrissy.

37:52.371 --> 37:55.140
I'll take it.

37:55.173 --> 37:57.809
How do we know that's
actually going to happen.

37:57.843 --> 38:00.579
Why don't we leave it to
Lauren and send her home.

38:00.612 --> 38:04.182
Lauren with an extra vote
isn't as dangerous as you

38:04.215 --> 38:05.283
telling everyone everything.

38:05.317 --> 38:06.251
Who trusts you?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.319
No one.

38:07.353 --> 38:09.020
At this point, not a single
person here trusts you.

38:09.054 --> 38:12.123
You had an alliance that was
good until

38:12.157 --> 38:12.824
you'll see.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.292
I didn't trust you three.

38:14.326 --> 38:15.527
That's why I...

38:15.561 --> 38:16.495
Exactly.

38:16.528 --> 38:19.164
I haven't had an alliance.

38:19.197 --> 38:21.367
I'm into it right now.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.135
Admit to you throwing her
name...

38:24.169 --> 38:24.970
I don't trust you anymore.

38:25.003 --> 38:25.737
Okay.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.739
That's fine.

38:27.773 --> 38:32.043
JEFF: Chrissy, plaque mail
for an extra vote, what might be

38:32.077 --> 38:33.745
an idol burning in the fire.

38:33.779 --> 38:36.314
It really is absolute chaos.

38:36.348 --> 38:39.785
It is, and hearing them
talking about how tight their

38:39.818 --> 38:43.855
alliance is makes me more sure
that at the next tribal it would

38:43.889 --> 38:45.056
be me.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.958
You're the biggest threat in
the game, Lauren.

38:46.992 --> 38:54.232
Obviously we're all threats,
so what the hell?

38:54.265 --> 38:56.201
Let's get rid of Ben?

38:56.234 --> 38:57.035
You can go.

38:57.068 --> 38:57.636
I don't care.

38:57.669 --> 39:03.775
I'm not going anywhere.

39:03.809 --> 39:06.378
JEFF: We don't need
Chrissy.

39:06.412 --> 39:09.114
Let's just get it over with.

39:09.147 --> 39:10.682
Get rid of Ben?

39:10.716 --> 39:13.218
Nope, nope, nope.

39:13.251 --> 39:14.853
Wow.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.121
She had the advantage.

39:16.154 --> 39:18.323
Why would you use that...

39:18.356 --> 39:20.992
Ben, what do you think is
going on over here.

39:21.026 --> 39:25.063
They're deciding whether to
spend me or lawn home.

39:25.096 --> 39:26.398
You know what I'm doing?

39:26.432 --> 39:27.899
I'm writing her name down.

39:27.933 --> 39:28.600
I'll say it.

39:28.634 --> 39:30.035
We knew that a long time ago.

39:30.068 --> 39:31.369
Oh, I know.

39:31.403 --> 39:34.406
JEFF: Chrissy, there are
people debating literally right

39:34.440 --> 39:35.674
now between Ben and Lauren.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.042
That's exactly true.

39:37.075 --> 39:44.215
This is 100% a live tribal
council.

39:44.249 --> 39:45.316
Jeff, we should vote.

39:45.350 --> 39:48.820
I'm ready to vote.

39:48.854 --> 39:56.394
JEFF: Lauren, you're up.

40:18.216 --> 40:25.457
JEFF: I'll go tally the
votes.

40:25.491 --> 40:27.993
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want to play it,

40:28.026 --> 40:39.771
now would be the time to do so.

40:39.805 --> 40:46.978
Hey, Jeff, I made this one
for my wife, but when I went the

40:47.012 --> 40:53.218
read my letter at the rock, my
wife led me to this one.

40:53.251 --> 40:59.558
So I'm going to go ahead and
play this one for myself.

40:59.591 --> 41:06.431
Thank you.

41:06.464 --> 41:10.068
JEFF: This is a hidden
immunity idol.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.270
Any votes cast for Ben will not
count.

41:12.303 --> 41:17.208
I'll read the votes.

41:17.242 --> 41:17.709
Ben.

41:17.743 --> 41:20.846
Does not count.

41:20.879 --> 41:21.279
Ben.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.882
Does not count.

41:23.915 --> 41:24.415
Ben.

41:24.449 --> 41:27.653
Does not count.

41:27.686 --> 41:28.253
Ben.

41:28.286 --> 41:32.023
Does not count.

41:32.057 --> 41:32.457
Ben.

41:32.490 --> 41:36.094
Does not count.

41:36.127 --> 41:36.595
Ben.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.163
Does not count.

41:38.196 --> 41:41.366
One vote left.

41:41.399 --> 41:45.804
12th person voted out and
fifth member of our jury,

41:45.837 --> 41:46.504
Lauren.

41:46.538 --> 41:47.606
You need to bring me your torch.

41:47.639 --> 41:57.215
Good game, Lauren.

41:57.248 --> 42:01.419
No Lauren, the tribe has spoken.

42:01.452 --> 42:02.053
Time for you to go.

42:02.087 --> 42:03.121
Good luck, guys.

42:03.154 --> 42:10.495
Thanks, Lauren.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.730
Crazy.

42:11.763 --> 42:15.366
JEFF: Well, it was a tribal
council in which everything was

42:15.400 --> 42:19.170
out in the open, and yet the one
thing that had the most power

42:19.204 --> 42:21.106
was the only secret.

42:21.139 --> 42:23.108
Grab your torches, head back to
camp.

42:23.141 --> 42:26.311
Good night.

42:32.250 --> 42:34.252
Captioned by
media access group at wgbh

42:34.820 --> 42:36.087
access.Wgbh.Org
JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes

42:37.288 --> 42:38.289
from our next episode.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.898
JEFF: Next time on
"survivor," Ben's big move

42:46.932 --> 42:47.899
breeds fear.

42:47.933 --> 42:52.537
He has a feriocity that
transcends this game.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.439
JEFF: But when all hope is
lost...

42:54.472 --> 42:56.107
Are you gunning for me?

42:56.141 --> 42:57.208
Everyone wants you out.

42:57.242 --> 42:59.077
JEFF: A Nemesis can turn
the tide.

42:59.110 --> 43:00.779
I want to send home Ashley.

43:00.812 --> 43:03.281
JEFF: This game is never as
simple as you want it to be.

43:03.314 --> 43:06.985
What happened tonight at
tribal is classic blind side.

43:07.018 --> 43:09.955
Ben had the upper hand on me,
but it is what it is.

43:09.988 --> 43:15.126
And the only reason why I'm
pretty much here is my dumb-dumb

43:15.160 --> 43:17.863
self gave Mike a piece of a
hidden immunity idol.

43:17.896 --> 43:19.064
I think it cursed me.

43:19.097 --> 43:19.698
I got it.

43:19.731 --> 43:22.968
It's a done deal now.

43:23.001 --> 43:23.601
I'm done.
