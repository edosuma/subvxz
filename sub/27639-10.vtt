"I'm laughing for some reason."

-And she agreed.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.378
to play favorites

of telling her everything,

05:45.929 --> 05:48.140
you don't say anything.

How is not trash talking

05:50.433 --> 05:52.393
No, because Terence still

05:50.433 --> 05:52.393
needs to go on the date.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.728
And again,

05:52.435 --> 05:53.728
not playing favorites,

05:53.770 --> 05:56.106
but there is no way Terence

05:53.770 --> 05:56.106
is any fun at a date.

06:02.988 --> 06:06.158
Plus, Saturday is

06:02.988 --> 06:06.158
the worst date night.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.617
Mmm, I think

06:06.200 --> 06:07.617
you're making that up.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.411
It's crowded, high expectations,

06:07.659 --> 06:10.411
so much noise.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.623
Trust me, this will be

06:10.453 --> 06:13.623
Terence's last date with Gwen.

06:13.665 --> 06:16.710
And once the stink of dating men

06:13.665 --> 06:16.710
from Handy fades away,

06:16.751 --> 06:17.878
you ask her out.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.378
But not

06:17.919 --> 06:19.378
on a Saturday?

06:19.420 --> 06:20.797
On a Thursday,

06:19.420 --> 06:20.797
if possible.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.423
The perfect date night.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.968
No presh,

06:22.465 --> 06:24.968
easy to get reservations.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.428
Some great water cooler buzz

06:25.010 --> 06:27.428
on Friday morning.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.805
And if everything goes well,

06:28.847 --> 06:31.558
you can transition into

06:28.847 --> 06:31.558
a second date on Saturday,

06:31.599 --> 06:33.852
the ultimate date night.

06:33.894 --> 06:37.314
So the plan is to wait it out

06:33.894 --> 06:37.314
and let Terence fail.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.900
Hundo-percento,

06:37.356 --> 06:39.900
you got this.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.069
You're the best.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.444
[telephone ringing]

06:43.486 --> 06:44.988
Hello?

06:45.030 --> 06:46.823
Really? I thought you

06:45.030 --> 06:46.823
hung up on me.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.413
[humming]

07:06.385 --> 07:07.468
You okay?

07:07.510 --> 07:08.427
Yeah.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.472
Take a free licorice.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.891
Already did. Thanks.

07:15.060 --> 07:19.439
Now, is best not to get

07:15.060 --> 07:19.439
too upset with your Umma.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.483
Or you. It's your beer

07:20.523 --> 07:22.483
in my room.

07:22.525 --> 07:23.902
But Umma sell

07:22.525 --> 07:23.902
your thing.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.030
-You knew about it.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.030
-But her idea.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.449
Well, I'm fine.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.449
I've let it go.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.534
And hopefully, you and Umma

07:29.490 --> 07:31.534
can do the same.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.163
I have nothing to let go.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.042
Appa, where is

07:36.539 --> 07:39.042
golden elephant?

07:39.084 --> 07:41.128
I don't know. Maybe you move

07:39.084 --> 07:41.128
when you clean?

07:41.169 --> 07:42.503
No, it's missing.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.546
That must be upsetting.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.881
Yeah, it's upsetting.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.508
Such a unique experience

07:44.923 --> 07:47.508
for you being upset.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.136
That something of yours

07:47.550 --> 07:49.136
that you really liked

07:49.177 --> 07:51.179
that was in your home

07:49.177 --> 07:51.179
where you thought it was safe

07:51.221 --> 07:52.347
has been sold.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.099
So, you were

07:52.389 --> 07:54.099
just still angry.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.310
You sold golden elephant statue?

07:56.351 --> 07:57.518
Yes, Umma, I did.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.062
[gasps]

07:59.104 --> 08:00.272
Just like you sold my stuff,

07:59.104 --> 08:00.272
in case you weren't getting it.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.648
You can't sell that.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.318
Oh, is your important stuff

08:01.689 --> 08:04.318
important to you?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.527
Hal-Abeoji was in that elephant.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.491
Grandpa's ashes?

08:12.326 --> 08:13.368
Oh, my God.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.661
Where is he?

08:14.702 --> 08:15.787
Umma, I am so sorry.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.914
I didn't know

08:15.829 --> 08:17.914
he was in the elephant.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.207
Okay, don't worry.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.252
I'll get him back.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.509
<i>Aboenim's</i> ash

08:27.590 --> 08:29.509
really in elephant?

08:30.551 --> 08:31.636
No.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.348
But the point is, Janet tried

08:31.678 --> 08:34.348
to mess with Umma.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.723
Big mistake.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.226
So, you teach

08:35.765 --> 08:38.226
a lesson to Janet.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.187
Not just Janet.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.480
Everybody.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.318
You gonna finish

08:45.233 --> 08:46.318
that spring roll?

08:46.360 --> 08:47.444
Yeah, man.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.695
Well, how about

08:47.486 --> 08:48.695
those veggie pecoras?

08:48.736 --> 08:50.447
I'm gonna eat

08:48.736 --> 08:50.447
my whole lunch.

08:50.489 --> 08:51.490
Get used to it.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.325
Fine.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.993
So I saw you talking

08:53.367 --> 08:54.993
to the courier the other day.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.744
Yeah, gonna ask her out.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.788
Yeah!

08:58.830 --> 09:00.165
So you found her

08:58.830 --> 09:00.165
favorite dog breeds?

09:00.207 --> 09:01.582
That was like

09:00.207 --> 09:01.582
four steps ago, bro.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.584
-She likes all the doodles.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.584
-Nice.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.919
Slight hiccup though.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.587
Terence is going out

09:04.961 --> 09:06.587
with her this Saturday.

09:06.629 --> 09:07.922
Why is she going out

09:06.629 --> 09:07.922
with Terence?

09:07.964 --> 09:09.841
I don't know. Why're there

09:07.964 --> 09:09.841
flying squirrels?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.592
Universe is a crazy place.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.719
You gotta go out

09:11.634 --> 09:12.719
with her first.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.595
Shannon said that

09:12.760 --> 09:14.595
I should wait for him to blow it

09:14.637 --> 09:15.972
then ask her out.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.598
Don't listen to Shannon.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.598
What does she know about dating?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.518
I assume a lot because

09:17.640 --> 09:19.518
she's dating someone.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.768
[mimics buzzer] Incorrect.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.312
What else did she say?

09:22.354 --> 09:24.647
Stuff about listening

09:22.354 --> 09:24.647
and not to wear a wrist watch.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.233
What? Why not?

09:26.274 --> 09:27.608
It makes you

09:26.274 --> 09:27.608
seem anal and like,

09:27.650 --> 09:29.694
you don't have time

09:27.650 --> 09:29.694
for the person you're with.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.612
What? That's not...

09:31.654 --> 09:33.240
No, it doesn't.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.033
Anyway, you gotta strike first.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.617
Once she sees

09:35.075 --> 09:36.617
how amazing you are,

09:36.659 --> 09:38.245
she'll probably cancel

09:36.659 --> 09:38.245
her date with Terence.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.787
Shannon was pretty confident

09:39.829 --> 09:41.998
that Terence

09:39.829 --> 09:41.998
was gonna be Terence.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.417
That's just it.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.377
He's the kind of guy

09:43.458 --> 09:45.377
that women date out of pity.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.627
If Gwen goes out

09:45.419 --> 09:46.627
with him first,

09:46.669 --> 09:47.921
his weakness will lure her

09:47.962 --> 09:50.006
into a, "Let's take on

09:47.962 --> 09:50.006
a project" relationship.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.632
I've seen it happen.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.632
I've made it happen.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.009
I've seen you make it happen.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.761
I know a lot more

09:53.051 --> 09:54.761
about this than Shannon does.

09:54.802 --> 09:55.929
You know how many

09:54.802 --> 09:55.929
first dates I've been on?

09:55.970 --> 09:57.389
Mmm-hmm, but how many

09:55.970 --> 09:57.389
second dates?

09:57.431 --> 09:58.765
You trying to get

09:57.431 --> 09:58.765
a second date right now?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.392
Worry about that later.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.768
Speaking of, I gotta jet.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.647
Unless you wanna

10:04.271 --> 10:06.647
talk about this more?

10:06.689 --> 10:08.400
I got time. I'm not anal.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.609
You're important.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.446
-I'm good.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.446
-Okay.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.535
[door bell chiming]

10:20.036 --> 10:22.247
I was too late.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.247
I couldn't get him back.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.998
Yeah, but uh, you tried.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.666
That's uh,

10:24.040 --> 10:25.666
most important.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.335
Umma will be okay.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.337
Maybe I should dedicate

10:27.377 --> 10:29.337
a park bench to him?

10:30.589 --> 10:32.507
Yeah, maybe.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.469
Or, or a monument

10:32.549 --> 10:35.469
at the cemetery.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.011
Did he like trees?

10:37.053 --> 10:40.681
Janet, you not give away

10:37.053 --> 10:40.681
Hal-Abeoji on purpose.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.642
I had no idea

10:40.723 --> 10:42.642
he was even in there.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.311
I thought he

10:42.683 --> 10:44.311
was buried in Busan,

10:44.352 --> 10:47.897
not sitting on a shelf next

10:44.352 --> 10:47.897
to a vase of plastic peonies.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.690
Okay, okay. Hmm?

10:49.732 --> 10:51.692
You learned

10:49.732 --> 10:51.692
lesson, huh. Yeah.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.860
Good news.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.696
Golden elephant statue

10:52.902 --> 10:55.696
not have Hal-Abeoji ash.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.241
Also, not real gold.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.577
-What?

10:58.283 --> 11:00.577
-Yeah. Just a gold color paint.

11:00.619 --> 11:01.911
Look real.

11:01.953 --> 11:05.706
So, Umma lied to me

11:01.953 --> 11:05.706
just so I would feel bad.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.708
Umma teach you

11:05.748 --> 11:07.708
very important lesson,

11:07.750 --> 11:09.710
just like you teach Umma

11:07.750 --> 11:09.710
important lesson

11:09.752 --> 11:11.463
when you, uh, sell elephant.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.256
Don't sell other

11:11.505 --> 11:13.256
people's things.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.341
Good lesson.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.842
Everyone finish

11:14.382 --> 11:15.842
learning now.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.552
End of story.

11:17.594 --> 11:21.515
Right. I mean, I just went

11:17.594 --> 11:21.515
through emotional

11:17.594 --> 11:21.515
torment all day,

11:21.556 --> 11:23.308
but, sure.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.518
-End of story.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.518
-Uh, Janet.

11:24.559 --> 11:25.810
Careful with the bread.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.061
Oops.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.855
I hope Grandpa's ashes

11:27.103 --> 11:28.855
weren't in there.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.315
Ha-ha, just kidding.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.483
End of story.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.198
I'm back.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.741
Hey, great to see you.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.494
You guys are

11:40.783 --> 11:42.494
already out of soap.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.329
Yeah, it's

11:42.536 --> 11:44.329
a filthy business.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.746
Lots of bird poop.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.081
Especially in the summer.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.834
Pigeons across the city

11:47.123 --> 11:49.834
just letting loose on cars.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.419
Bird poop everywhere.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.380
Sure.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.507
Hey, I saw someone

11:55.549 --> 11:57.925
rocking a pair of Air Jordans

11:55.549 --> 11:57.925
on my way here.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.760
-Made me think of you.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.760
-Do you want to go out sometime?

11:59.802 --> 12:01.720
-I'd like that.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.720
-Preferably before Saturday.

12:01.762 --> 12:02.721
Oh, um...

12:03.682 --> 12:04.765
Maybe.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.767
Friday's no good.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.767
Indoor soccer, star player.

12:06.809 --> 12:07.768
Oh.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.979
-No, for Wednesday.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.979
-What about Thursday?

12:10.021 --> 12:11.565
-Great day.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.565
-Not for me.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.692
Unless you wanna meet

12:11.606 --> 12:13.692
at 7:00 a.m.

12:13.732 --> 12:14.775
Perfect.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.110
-Seriously?

12:14.817 --> 12:16.110
-Why not?

12:16.152 --> 12:18.572
-We could do breakfast.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.572
-That's ridiculous. I love it.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.781
Okay, let's do it.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.076
But no judging if I put

12:20.823 --> 12:23.076
syrup on my eggs.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.285
No promises, weirdo.

12:25.828 --> 12:26.996
No, no, no, no.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.707
Breakfast?

12:27.038 --> 12:28.707
Breakfast is terrible.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.375
Why? What's wrong with

12:28.747 --> 12:30.375
flirting over hash browns?

12:30.417 --> 12:31.792
Nothing, if it's late

12:30.417 --> 12:31.792
on a Sunday

12:31.834 --> 12:33.086
and it's called brunch

12:31.834 --> 12:33.086
and it's not your first date.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.421
What time are you

12:33.127 --> 12:34.421
meeting her?

12:34.462 --> 12:35.630
-7:00.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.630
-[both groan]

12:35.672 --> 12:36.797
This is devastating.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.341
-Should I cancel?

12:36.839 --> 12:38.341
-No, no, no, no, no.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.426
The only thing worse than

12:38.383 --> 12:39.426
being asked out

12:39.467 --> 12:40.801
on a 7:00 a.m. breakfast date,

12:40.843 --> 12:42.429
is having your 7:00 a.m.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.429
breakfast date cancel on you.

12:42.970 --> 12:43.971
So, what do I do?

12:44.847 --> 12:46.266
We can still save this.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.808
You need to be

12:46.307 --> 12:47.808
a fun morning person.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.394
Maybe colorful socks.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.394
Women love that.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.811
They're fun.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.811
It's fun. Be fun.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.230
I disagree.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.230
I'd go sockless.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.607
It says free

12:52.272 --> 12:53.607
and ready for anything.

12:53.648 --> 12:54.773
Nobody wants to see bare feet

12:54.815 --> 12:55.816
during their first meal

12:54.815 --> 12:55.816
of the day.

12:55.858 --> 12:56.817
But I have

12:55.858 --> 12:56.817
great looking feet.

12:56.859 --> 12:57.860
Yeah, we're talking

12:56.859 --> 12:57.860
about Kimchee.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.112
Right. Socks on.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.614
And be assertive.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.031
Make it seem like a breakfast

13:00.655 --> 13:02.031
date is totally normal

13:02.073 --> 13:04.242
and she's judgy

13:02.073 --> 13:04.242
for thinking it's not.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.494
What if we just get coffee

13:04.284 --> 13:06.494
and go for a walk?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.622
-Is he even listening?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.622
-Trust us.

13:08.663 --> 13:09.706
We're your only hope.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.750
Exclamation mark,

13:09.748 --> 13:11.750
exclamation mark.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.668
Okay, what time is it?

13:11.790 --> 13:13.668
I have to hop in a call soon.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.837
Oh, I wouldn't know. I actually

13:13.710 --> 13:16.837
got rid of my watch ages ago.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.381
Don't know what

13:16.879 --> 13:18.381
time it is. Don't care.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.798
[Kimchee] I think

13:18.423 --> 13:19.798
it's around 3:00.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.799
Seriously?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.971
[exhales deeply]

13:25.012 --> 13:26.681
[Mr. Mehta] What did you do?

13:25.012 --> 13:26.681
[Appa] Nothing.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.683
Mrs. Kim and Janet

13:26.723 --> 13:28.683
are fighting.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.351
I just get stuck

13:28.725 --> 13:30.351
in the middle.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.103
Mr. Kim.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.897
You are

13:32.145 --> 13:34.897
in the sweet spot.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.857
Don't taste

13:34.939 --> 13:36.857
sweet to me.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.026
When Mrs. Mehta

13:36.899 --> 13:39.026
and Raj are fighting,

13:39.068 --> 13:41.028
I can do whatever I want.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.864
No opposition,

13:41.070 --> 13:43.864
no nagging.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.659
She's too blinded

13:43.906 --> 13:45.659
by her own rage.

13:45.700 --> 13:49.245
Mrs. Kim too

13:45.700 --> 13:49.245
is blind by rage. [growls]

13:49.287 --> 13:50.913
But usually

13:49.287 --> 13:50.913
it's directed at you.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.999
-Hmm.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.999
-Now she's focused on Janet.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.710
It's time to indulge.

13:55.752 --> 13:56.877
Get your teeth capped.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.879
Take sailing lesson,

13:56.919 --> 13:58.879
buy an ATV.

13:58.921 --> 13:59.922
Why I do that?

13:59.964 --> 14:02.049
Driving over logs,

13:59.964 --> 14:02.049
fording rivers,

14:02.091 --> 14:04.177
The smell of moss

14:02.091 --> 14:04.177
in your hair.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.513
-I could go see movie.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.513
-Think bigger.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.892
I always want

14:09.848 --> 14:11.892
a reclining chair.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.894
Sit with

14:11.934 --> 14:13.894
a home-brew beer,

14:13.936 --> 14:15.522
watch a Blue Jay game.

14:16.939 --> 14:17.982
Well, it's a start.

14:25.948 --> 14:26.907
Do we know where they went?

14:26.949 --> 14:28.284
Tell me it wasn't

14:26.949 --> 14:28.284
Golden Griddle.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.619
Does it even matter?

14:29.661 --> 14:31.412
No, a trainwreck's

14:29.661 --> 14:31.412
a trainwreck.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.913
I've already set

14:31.454 --> 14:32.913
him up some profiles

14:32.955 --> 14:33.914
on the best dating sites.

14:33.956 --> 14:34.957
He'll bounce back.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.085
Hey, nice socks.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.629
Oh, you've

14:38.127 --> 14:39.629
never seen these?

14:39.671 --> 14:41.548
When I wear socks, I want them

14:39.671 --> 14:41.548
to be like a supernova

14:41.589 --> 14:42.799
or a star exploding.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.634
[giggles] Those are

14:42.841 --> 14:44.634
the same thing.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.927
Oh, here he is.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.054
[Kimchee] Thanks for

14:46.969 --> 14:48.054
dropping me off at work.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.557
Yeah, I wanted to make sure

14:48.095 --> 14:50.557
you arrived safely

14:50.598 --> 14:51.932
and work off

14:50.598 --> 14:51.932
some of those waffles.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.227
I've never want to go

14:51.974 --> 14:54.227
to Belgium until this morning.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.687
That was fun.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.355
Maybe next time,

14:55.729 --> 14:57.355
we could try lunch?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.357
Oh, that might be

14:57.397 --> 14:59.357
moving fast.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.359
How about

14:59.399 --> 15:01.359
a mid-morning donut?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.444
I'm old-fashioned

15:01.401 --> 15:03.444
that way.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.863
Solid donut joke.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.197
-[giggles]

15:04.904 --> 15:06.197
-I'll call you.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.281
Okay.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.911
So nice of her to drive you

15:09.743 --> 15:11.911
to work, considering...

15:11.952 --> 15:13.246
Considering how well it went.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.789
Really? We did it.

15:14.831 --> 15:15.956
I did it.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.417
Sure, with a little help from

15:15.998 --> 15:17.417
your big old boss

15:17.458 --> 15:18.668
and your little old pal.

15:18.710 --> 15:19.878
Well, Kimchee deserves

15:18.710 --> 15:19.878
some of the credit

15:19.919 --> 15:20.961
for doing what we said.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.922
I didn't do

15:21.003 --> 15:22.922
anything you guys said.

15:22.963 --> 15:23.964
Are you nuts?

15:22.963 --> 15:23.964
Why not?

15:24.006 --> 15:25.007
I didn't need to.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.134
The date was easy

15:25.049 --> 15:27.134
because of my system.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.430
Get to know someone over time

15:27.176 --> 15:30.430
and if they seem into it,

15:30.471 --> 15:32.223
ask them on a date.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.101
[Terence laughing] I know,

15:32.265 --> 15:35.101
I know, and I ate it all.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.770
[both laughing]

15:36.811 --> 15:39.689
She's probably

15:36.811 --> 15:39.689
canceling on him.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.776
Yeah, in a friendly

15:39.731 --> 15:42.776
arm-touching kind of way.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.569
I'll see you

15:42.817 --> 15:44.569
Saturday night.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.320
Don't forget to

15:44.611 --> 15:46.320
warm up those lips.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.572
[Gwen] I won't.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.241
Hey. Stop slacking, guys.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.577
[laughs]

15:50.283 --> 15:52.577
Just having fun.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.961
And it come in green?

16:03.045 --> 16:04.088
What you doing?

16:04.130 --> 16:07.341
Uh, just think about

16:04.130 --> 16:07.341
what Janet is doing.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.760
Make me so angry.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.011
Yeah, I know. She forget

16:08.802 --> 16:11.011
what we do for her.

16:11.053 --> 16:11.971
Yeah.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.974
And in leather

16:13.055 --> 16:14.974
or microfiber?

16:16.476 --> 16:17.977
Janet.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.229
Where you coming from?

16:18.018 --> 16:20.229
Your shift start one hour ago.

16:20.271 --> 16:23.149
Sorry, I haven't been home

16:20.271 --> 16:23.149
since yesterday.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.193
But, the important thing is

16:23.190 --> 16:26.193
that I have the elephant.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.570
-You have elephant?

16:26.235 --> 16:27.570
-Yeah.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.948
Good, you hear, Appa.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.240
Yeah, yeah, good.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.827
The guy at the pawn shop

16:31.282 --> 16:33.827
knew the woman who bought it.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.621
He warned me not to try

16:33.868 --> 16:36.621
to get it back but I had to try.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.038
Okay, good work.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.000
So, I knocked on the woman's

16:38.080 --> 16:41.000
door and she was so mean.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.003
She told me I couldn't have it

16:41.041 --> 16:44.003
unless I paid her 3,000 dollars.

16:44.629 --> 16:45.672
So you said no?

16:46.088 --> 16:47.340
Are you kidding?

16:47.381 --> 16:51.051
I couldn't let a stranger

16:47.381 --> 16:51.051
have Hal-Abeoji.

16:51.093 --> 16:54.054
I saw how upset you were

16:51.093 --> 16:54.054
when he was gone.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.140
So, I emptied my bank account,

16:56.182 --> 16:57.976
and sold my camera,

16:56.182 --> 16:57.976
and...

16:59.727 --> 17:01.604
It doesn't matter

16:59.727 --> 17:01.604
how I got the rest.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.105
No, Janet, what you do?

17:03.147 --> 17:04.231
It's not important.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.693
The purpose

17:04.273 --> 17:06.693
of my body

17:06.734 --> 17:08.903
is to serve

17:06.734 --> 17:08.903
my parents.

17:08.945 --> 17:12.448
What matters is I have

17:08.945 --> 17:12.448
Grandpa's ashes back.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.951
I hope you can forgive me.

17:14.993 --> 17:16.076
[Appa] What about footstool?

17:16.118 --> 17:18.078
Come out of chair? How?

17:18.120 --> 17:19.706
Oh, like

17:18.120 --> 17:19.706
a Jack in box.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.081
Yeah, I can forgive you.

17:21.123 --> 17:24.043
-Oh, I see.

17:21.123 --> 17:24.043
-Thanks, Umma.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.670
Can I see his ashes?

17:25.712 --> 17:27.630
I went through

17:25.712 --> 17:27.630
so much to bring him back.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.090
-Janet--

17:27.672 --> 17:30.090
-It would mean so much to me.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.384
Janet, just leave, huh?

17:31.425 --> 17:33.636
When you's older.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.636
It's a Korean tradition.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.513
How does the elephant

17:33.678 --> 17:35.513
even open?

17:35.555 --> 17:37.807
-The tail? The trunk?

17:35.555 --> 17:37.807
-It's complicated--

17:37.849 --> 17:39.099
Show me the ashes, Umma.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.060
Uh, delivery to uh, 252...

17:41.101 --> 17:42.603
Why don't you want

17:41.101 --> 17:42.603
to show me the ashes?

17:42.645 --> 17:44.313
Is it because

17:42.645 --> 17:44.313
there aren't any?

17:44.355 --> 17:45.523
Appa told me.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.858
[gasps]

17:46.900 --> 17:48.108
I have to go now.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.108
Bye-bye.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.109
[phone beeps]

17:50.319 --> 17:52.488
-Why you tell her?

17:50.319 --> 17:52.488
-Because she's crying.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.281
-You go too far.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.281
-She go too far.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.076
I can't believe you let me think

17:54.323 --> 17:57.076
I lost Grandpa's ashes for real.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.619
Okay, so...

17:59.245 --> 18:01.080
Maybe I lie about ash.

18:01.121 --> 18:05.125
But truth is, elephant is

18:01.121 --> 18:05.125
a present my Umma give to me.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.127
It's so stupid present.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.005
I hate this elephant present.

18:09.047 --> 18:12.258
So, we have a big fight

18:09.047 --> 18:12.258
about stupid elephant present.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.802
And then she

18:12.299 --> 18:14.802
get sick after that.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.345
So fast.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.139
And my last word to her

18:19.181 --> 18:22.393
is complaining about

18:19.181 --> 18:22.393
stupid elephant present to me.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.686
[Umma crying]

18:23.728 --> 18:24.979
[whispers] Is that true?

18:27.732 --> 18:29.692
Well, I'm sorry that happened.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.946
And I hope we never

18:29.734 --> 18:32.946
have that conversation.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.739
Thank you, Janet.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.323
I accept your apology.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.325
I wasn't... Just...

18:38.367 --> 18:39.577
Don't touch my stuff.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.919
Is that a true story?

18:52.966 --> 18:53.967
Yobo?

19:00.514 --> 19:02.809
All right, who wants

19:00.514 --> 19:02.809
to rent out some cars?

19:02.850 --> 19:04.602
Uh-oh, someone had

19:02.850 --> 19:04.602
a good weekend.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.145
But don't sweat it.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.773
I'll leave you guys to catch up,

19:06.186 --> 19:08.773
if you know what I mean.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.816
I don't.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.193
So, T-bag.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.195
Did you and Gwen hang out

19:13.235 --> 19:15.195
over the weekend?

19:15.237 --> 19:16.697
Oh, yeah, we did.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.157
-How did you--

19:16.739 --> 19:18.157
-Scoop her up?

19:18.532 --> 19:19.617
Yes.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.827
You know, a lot

19:19.659 --> 19:20.827
of people seek me out.

19:20.868 --> 19:21.953
'Cause of my reputation.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.746
Although, Gwen is very special.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.205
She is.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.207
Not the best I've had, but with

19:25.247 --> 19:27.207
a little help, she could be.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.208
Whoa, I don't wanna hear that.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.335
She's got fast fingers

19:29.376 --> 19:30.795
and a great instrument.

19:30.837 --> 19:31.963
Her mom gave her that.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.256
What are you talking about?

19:34.882 --> 19:36.592
Her flute.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.803
I teach her flute.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.803
But, what're you talking about?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.220
Oh, my God!

19:40.262 --> 19:42.222
Thank you!

19:40.262 --> 19:42.222
That is so good to hear.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.725
-Why? Do you play?

19:42.264 --> 19:44.725
-No!

19:44.767 --> 19:46.435
I just thought you

19:44.767 --> 19:46.435
and Gwen were dating.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.187
[both chuckle]

19:49.271 --> 19:50.606
Oh, God, no.

19:50.648 --> 19:53.233
That's hilarious that you

19:50.648 --> 19:53.233
thought we were still dating.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.569
-"Still"?

19:53.275 --> 19:55.569
-Oh, yeah, we used to date.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.571
For like, a year,

19:55.611 --> 19:57.571
but it didn't work out.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.448
Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.075
I would not shut up.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.201
She hated that.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.244
[exhales deeply]

20:04.286 --> 20:06.789
Let me know if you ever

20:04.286 --> 20:06.789
wanna pick up the flute.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.541
It's just a matter

20:06.831 --> 20:08.541
of fingering an embouchure.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.085
Ew, stop making music

20:08.582 --> 20:11.085
sound so gross.

20:12.670 --> 20:13.963
[WHISPERS]

20:12.670 --> 20:13.963
Did you catch any of that?

20:14.005 --> 20:15.715
I think Terence is dating

20:14.005 --> 20:15.715
a music teacher.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.258
I can see you guys.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.094
Mind you own business, Terence.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.639
[giggling]

20:25.307 --> 20:27.476
Okay, and open.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.269
Surprise!

20:29.311 --> 20:30.646
-[chuckles]

20:29.311 --> 20:30.646
-What is...

20:31.189 --> 20:32.314
It's for me.

20:32.857 --> 20:33.900
And you.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.193
For us.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.278
Uh-huh. And why you get

20:35.234 --> 20:38.278
new chair for us?

20:38.320 --> 20:39.697
It's a...

20:39.739 --> 20:42.033
"Teaching Janet

20:39.739 --> 20:42.033
a lesson" present.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.283
We already have chair.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.244
Yeah, but, can that chair

20:46.120 --> 20:47.121
do this?

20:48.081 --> 20:49.123
Ah.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.416
Yeah, all chair did that.

20:50.457 --> 20:51.667
I'm not finished yet.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.252
Hand me Appa Hopper.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.339
[exhales]

20:58.758 --> 20:59.926
Turn on TV.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.264
And uh, you sit there.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.060
[groans] Still the same.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.269
Wait for it.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.318
[buzzer on TV]

21:18.360 --> 21:20.571
Okay, close your eye again.
