Today is Career Day!

00:29.597 --> 00:31.832
All right! Whoo!

00:31.865 --> 00:33.401
I didn't know
today was a holiday.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.436
♪ Career Day ♪

00:35.469 --> 00:37.438
We gets the day off, baby!

00:37.471 --> 00:40.108
Day off? Holiday?
What are you talking about?

00:40.141 --> 00:42.743
Career Day is the opposite
of a holiday.

00:42.776 --> 00:46.414
It is a day dedicated entirely
to the consideration of work.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.382
Ooh, like the Labor Day?

00:48.416 --> 00:49.583
We get the day off!

00:51.652 --> 00:54.088
Stop that! Career Day and
Labor Day are different.

00:54.122 --> 00:56.357
Career Day is the day
you pick your career.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.559
Which is the soul-crushing job that
you'll do for the rest of your life.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.394
But we already have the careers.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.396
Yeah. We're superheroes.

01:02.430 --> 01:06.134
Mmm, not for much longer.
Remember we are the "Teen Titans."

01:06.167 --> 01:09.803
Once you're no longer teens, you will all
be kicked out to live on the streets.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.272
That's cold.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.440
The world is an uncaring place.

01:12.473 --> 01:15.443
Now, let's get
Career Day started!

01:17.178 --> 01:19.680
What would you like
your careers to be?

01:21.682 --> 01:25.219
I wanna be a dancer!

01:25.253 --> 01:28.622
My career dream is to be
a friend to all the kitties.

01:28.656 --> 01:32.293
I don't care what I does as long
as I does it with my best friend.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.895
- Same here, bro.
- No, no, no!

01:34.928 --> 01:36.630
Dreams do not pay the bills.

01:36.664 --> 01:39.300
What you need are sensible,
boring, soul-crushing jobs.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.768
You don't see me
chasing my dream

01:40.801 --> 01:43.171
of being a professional
basketball player.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.640
Well, now,
that's just unrealistic.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.476
You do not meet
the height requirement.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.144
I'm tall enough to ball.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.480
Professional basketball
is just really competitive.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.915
Especially if you're short.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.185
My point is, following a dream

01:57.218 --> 02:00.321
is a one-way ticket to the garbage
dump called disappointment.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.323
Hey!

02:02.356 --> 02:05.193
Since you're all delusional, I
will pick your careers for you.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.927
Raven, you're going to be
a dentist.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.163
You get to put your hands
inside other people's mouths

02:09.197 --> 02:10.598
and fix their disgusting teeth.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.200
- Both hands?
- Up to you.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.936
Starfire, you're going to be
a civil engineer.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.605
That means you'll be responsible

02:17.638 --> 02:19.873
for designing and managing
construction projects.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.710
That indeed sounds
the soul-crushing.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.778
Beast Boy, Cyborg,

02:24.812 --> 02:27.481
you're going to be CEO's of
multi-million-dollar corporations.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.250
- Can we do it together?
- No!

02:29.283 --> 02:30.684
The world of business
is ruthless!

02:30.718 --> 02:33.221
Your goal is to make profits,
not friends!

02:33.254 --> 02:36.357
I don't want to do that
for the rest of my life!

02:36.390 --> 02:39.693
Yes! You're finally getting
into the spirit of Career Day.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.730
Now, waste your life away doing a job you hate!

02:48.502 --> 02:50.371
So, you've got a toothache, huh?

02:50.404 --> 02:52.740
Let's take a look. Open wide.

02:52.773 --> 02:56.210
Wider. I need to get
both my hands in there.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.378
That's one.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.679
Wider.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.981
There we go.
Now, let's see.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.284
Hmm.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.419
Uh, yup, you've got a cavity.
Gonna have to drill it.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.523
I know. I'd rather be
somewhere else too.

03:35.283 --> 03:38.786
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪

03:57.305 --> 03:59.440
Oh, sorry.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.309
But at least
your toothache is gone.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.312
Mmm.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.314
I'm really glad I followed
my passion for dancing.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.683
Mama got that dentist money now!

04:46.854 --> 04:49.490
As you can see,
we've leveraged our assets

04:49.523 --> 04:51.325
and increased them good profits.

04:51.359 --> 04:55.329
Business is booming. We've got
all these net gains happening now.

04:55.363 --> 04:59.400
This is another nice chart.
As you can see, this arrow is pointing up.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.535
We're going
big league here, guys.

05:01.569 --> 05:04.438
And that concludes
the presentation.

ain't mean a thing

06:25.586 --> 06:27.788
if we can't be
big businessmens together!

06:27.821 --> 06:30.891
I know, dude! But the world of
business is ruthless, remember?

06:30.924 --> 06:32.426
We can't afford to...

06:34.562 --> 06:36.129
We can't afford to be friends.

06:36.163 --> 06:39.800
Forget that! I says
we merge our companies.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.770
But your company makes fans
and my company makes couches.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.772
How are we supposed
to merge that?

06:47.975 --> 06:49.610
Fan couches, yo.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.513
Sick.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.627
We did it, dude!

07:06.660 --> 07:08.462
Just goes to show, you can
follow your passion in life

07:08.496 --> 07:09.897
and still be successful!

07:09.930 --> 07:11.732
That's what's up!

07:11.765 --> 07:14.768
Boo-ya!
- He's living the dream, yo!

07:29.983 --> 07:32.486
I am sorry, Mrs. Kitty,

07:32.520 --> 07:34.988
but I can no longer play.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.525
For I must engineer the civils.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.660
Let us see.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.663
The skyscraper should be the tall.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.666
Also, it should have the
windows for the seeing of out.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.002
And it shall certainly have
the waterslide

07:49.036 --> 07:51.639
for when the occupants wish
to slide on the water.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.009
Now, I will add
the wings so it can fly!

07:56.043 --> 07:59.513
Oh, and do not think I forgot
to give the building a face.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.522
Oh, Mrs. Kitty.

08:08.556 --> 08:11.559
I have designed the most
wonderful of skyscrapers,

08:11.592 --> 08:13.561
but no one will build it.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.830
You look like
the fuzzy construction worker.

08:19.266 --> 08:22.069
An idea has suddenly formed
in my pre-frontal cortex.

08:34.047 --> 08:38.251
It is incredible that no one
thought to employ the kitten cats

08:38.285 --> 08:40.053
as the construction
workers before.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.692
They always do the landing
on their feet.

08:46.927 --> 08:50.097
And the nine lives are also
useful on the construction site.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.642
I have succeeded at my career

09:01.675 --> 09:05.178
and I have fulfilled my dream of
becoming a friend to all the kitties.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.748
I believe this calls
for the whoop-whoop-whoop.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.883
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!

09:09.917 --> 09:11.885
Meow, meow, meow, meow!

09:11.919 --> 09:15.088
Meow, whoop, meow, whoop-whoop!

09:15.122 --> 09:16.189
Joy!

09:18.626 --> 09:21.595
- So, how was Career Day, Titans?
- It was awesome!

09:21.629 --> 09:23.263
Beast Boy and I merged
our businesses

09:23.296 --> 09:25.032
and now we're more successful
than ever!

09:25.065 --> 09:27.735
We is best friends
and business partners, y'all!

09:27.768 --> 09:30.871
I was able to combine dentistry and dancing.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.107
And I employed the kitten cats
to build the building.

09:34.141 --> 09:37.778
So, you're saying you can follow your
passion and have a successful career?

09:37.811 --> 09:39.312
That's right, yo!

09:39.346 --> 09:40.648
I...

09:40.681 --> 09:42.616
I didn't think it was possible.

09:42.650 --> 09:47.154
Titans, you have inspired me
to follow my dream!

09:47.187 --> 09:51.124
I am going to be a
professional basketball player!

09:51.158 --> 09:53.093
- No, Robin.
- You're way too short.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.629
- That's just unrealistic.
- Get yourself a real job, fool.
