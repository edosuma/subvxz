HOW MUCH CLEARER
DO YOU WANT IT?

06:59.628 --> 07:01.335
IF YOU STILL
DON'T KNOW WHO I AM

IS MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.822
I TRUST THAT
WILL SUIT YOU.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.571

FOR DEATH DURING SLEEP.

SIMPLE AND PAINLESS-

NO, JUST A MINUTE.
I DON'T WANNA GO!

07:41.878 --> 07:43.835
NO, THEY NEVER DO.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.835
BUT THERE'S NO REASON TO GO.
I'M A VERY HEALTHY MAN!

07:46.925 --> 07:50.259
OUTSIDE OF A SLIGHT COLD
I HAD LAST WINTER,

07:50.303 --> 07:53.466
AND A SLIVER THAT FESTERED
IN THAT FINGER THERE,

07:53.556 --> 07:56.048
I DON'T THINK I'VE HAD
A SICK DAY IN 2O YEARS!

07:56.142 --> 07:57.678
THAT MAY BE,

07:57.769 --> 07:59.931
BUT DEPARTURE TIME
IS SET FOR MIDNIGHT.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.221
AND DEPARTURE
WILL BE MIDNIGHT.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.522
DON'T I HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.691
WE DO LISTEN TO APPEALS

08:06.778 --> 08:09.440
BUT FRANKLY, MR. BOOKMAN,
THERE'S VERY LITTLE HERE

08:09.531 --> 08:11.693
IN THE WAY OF AN
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.115
THERE ARE THREE MAJOR
CATEGORIES OF APPEALS.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.613
ONE, IS HARDSHIP CASES.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.615
NOW DO YOU
HAVE A WIFE OR FAMILY

08:17.706 --> 08:20.949
VVHO MIGHT SUFFER BEYOND A
REASONABLE POINT YOUR DEMISE?

08:21.001 --> 08:24.915
[softly]
NO, NO FAMILY. NO.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.373
THE SECOND CATEGORY
IS PRIORITY CASES

08:28.466 --> 08:31.549
STATESMEN, SCIENTISTS, MEN
ON THE VERGE OF DISCOVERIES.

08:31.636 --> 08:37.881
I TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT VVORKING ON ANY
MAJOR SCIENTIFIC PURSUIT AT THE MOMENT.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.138
[softly]
NO [chuckles] NO.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.644
[firmly]
WHAT'S THE THIRD CATEGORY?

08:42.731 --> 08:45.974
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
QUALIFIED HERE EITHER.

08:46.067 --> 08:49.401
UNFINISHED BUSINESS
OF A MAJOR NATURE.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.900
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
UNFINISHED BUSINESS, DO YOU?

08:52.991 --> 08:54.026
AH, BUT I DO!

08:54.117 --> 08:55.482
INDEED I DO!

08:55.535 --> 08:58.152
THAT'S IT,
YOU SEE. I-- YEAH.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.408
I HAVE SOME
UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.206
UNFINISHED BUSINESS, YES.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.588
I'VE NEVER FLOWN
IN A HELICOPTER. THAT'S IT.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.256

09:11.342 --> 09:13.754
<i>(Death)
INSUFFICIENT, MR. BOOKMAN.</i>

09:16.347 --> 09:18.338
<i>ANYTHING ELSE?</i>

09:18.391 --> 09:22.100
NOVV YOU LOOK HERE. I'VE LIVED
IN THIS ROOM FOR 21 YEARS.

09:22.187 --> 09:25.896
AND YOU KEEP POPPING UP IN CORNERS OF
THE ROOM I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN BEFORE.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.723
WILL YOU PLEASE
STAY IN ONE PLACE?

09:27.817 --> 09:30.525
IS THERE ANYTHING
ELSE, MR. BOOKMAN?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.072
YES, YES.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.943
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
A ZULU WAR DANCE.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.400
NOW THAT'S
THE ANSWER RIGHT THERE.

09:37.494 --> 09:41.078
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE ME A COUPLE OF
MONTHS TO GO OVER TO THAT ZULU COUNTRY

09:41.164 --> 09:43.371
NO?

09:43.458 --> 09:45.916
NO. UNFINISHED BUSINESS
OF A MAJOR NATURE

09:46.002 --> 09:48.118
<i>IS SOMETHING A MAN
HAD YEARNED FOR</i>

09:48.213 --> 09:50.955
<i>AND SOMETHING HE MIGHT
ACCOMPLISH GIVEN AN EXTENSION.</i>

09:51.049 --> 09:53.837
WELL, THERE IS ONE THING.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.214
WHAT IS IT, MR. BOOKMAN?

09:56.262 --> 09:59.050
WELL, BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

09:59.099 --> 10:01.761
I NEVER MADE
A TRULY BIG PITCH.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.639
I MEAN, I MEAN
A BIG PITCH.

10:04.729 --> 10:08.893
A PITCH BIG ENOUGH
FOR THE SKIES TO OPEN UP.

10:08.983 --> 10:12.396
<i>YOU KNOW,
A PITCH FOR THE ANGELS.</i>

10:12.445 --> 10:15.062
OF COURSE, IT WOULDN'T
MEAN VERY MUCH TO YOU,

10:15.115 --> 10:16.901
BUT IT WOULD MEAN
A GREAT DEAL TO ME.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.244
<i>IT WOULD MEAN
THAT FOR ONE MOMENT</i>

10:19.285 --> 10:23.153
<i>IN MY WHOLE LIFE I WOULD HAVE
DONE SOMETHING SUCCESSFUL.</i>

10:23.248 --> 10:28.288
IT VVOULD MEAN THAT MAYBE THE
CHILDREN VVOULD BE VERY PROUD OF ME.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.494
THE CHILDREN?

10:30.588 --> 10:34.422
YES, YES, I'VE ALVVAYS HAD QUITE A
FONDNESS FOR CHILDREN, YOU KNOVV.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.625
YES, THAT'S ALL
HERE IN THE RECORD.

10:36.719 --> 10:40.963
THE PROBLEM HERE, MR. BOOKMAN, IS
THAT YOU'D REQUIRE DELAY UNTIL-

10:41.057 --> 10:42.923
UNTIL I MAKE A PITCH!

10:43.017 --> 10:45.509
THE KIND OF PITCH
I WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.980
THE ONE FOR THE ANGELS?

10:47.063 --> 10:49.555
THAT'S RIGHT.
ONE FOR THE ANGELS.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.355
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY,
MR. BOOKMAN,

10:54.445 --> 10:56.186
BUT, NO.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.986

AND YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL I MAKE THAT PITCH.
