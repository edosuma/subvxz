00:31.266 --> 00:32.133
WELCOME TO THE SHOW STILL

00:32.200 --> 00:34.100
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID.

00:34.166 --> 00:35.100
THINK OF IT AS THE INSIDE OF

00:35.166 --> 00:36.500
AN OYSTER, MAKING ME THE PEARL.

00:36.566 --> 00:37.666
WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE -- I'M A

SMALL WHITE IRRITANT TO WHICH

00:38.866 --> 00:39.833
SOME PEOPLE HAVE INEXPLICABLY

00:39.900 --> 00:41.233
ASSIGNED VALUE.

00:41.300 --> 00:41.866
THIS WAS A BUSY WEEK, DOMINATED

00:41.933 --> 00:43.333

Y'KNOW.

00:50.033 --> 00:51.000

00:51.066 --> 00:51.766
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT -- OR,

00:51.833 --> 00:52.866

SAYING -- IT'S A CLICHE --

01:01.166 --> 01:02.066
AN UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTION,

01:02.133 --> 01:03.466
AND IT HAS BEEN AN

01:03.533 --> 01:05.233
UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTION.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.266
>> John: YEAH, OKAY, WE GET IT.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.100
IT WAS AN "UNCONVENTIONAL

01:07.166 --> 01:08.200
CONVENTION."

01:08.266 --> 01:09.433
THE THING IS, THAT'S ONE OF

01:09.500 --> 01:10.600
THOSE PHRASES THAT SOUNDS LIKE

01:10.666 --> 01:12.466
IT HAS GRAVITY, BUT ACTUALLY

01:12.533 --> 01:13.800
MEANS NEXT TO NOTHING, LIKE

01:13.866 --> 01:14.966
"IT IS WHAT IT IS" OR

01:15.033 --> 01:16.233
"QUIBI EXCLUSIVE."

01:16.300 --> 01:19.266
AND WHILE THE LACK OF ATTENDEES

01:19.333 --> 01:20.066
DID MAKE SOME THINGS AWKWARD,

01:20.133 --> 01:20.833
THERE WERE UPSIDES, TOO.

01:20.900 --> 01:21.800
FOR INSTANCE, THE ROLL CALL OF

01:21.866 --> 01:22.966
DELEGATES WAS DONE VIRTUALLY

01:23.033 --> 01:24.233
THIS YEAR, WITH STATES AND

01:24.300 --> 01:25.600
TERRITORIES FINDING NOVEL WAYS

01:25.666 --> 01:27.600
TO SHOWCASE THEMSELVES.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.866
ASSUME IS HIS NEW SOCIAL MEDIA

01:32.933 --> 01:33.800
START-UP, AND THE ENTIRE

01:33.866 --> 01:35.000
POPULATION OF MONTANA TURNED UP.

01:35.066 --> 01:36.000
BUT IT WAS THE STATE OF

01:36.066 --> 01:37.600
RHODE ISLAND THAT STOLE THE SHOW

01:37.666 --> 01:39.566
WITH THIS MOMENT.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.666

01:54.733 --> 01:55.966
WAS RHODE ISLAND'S OFFICIAL

01:56.033 --> 01:57.266
STATE APPETIZER.

01:57.333 --> 01:58.166
IT MIGHT BE THE FIRST THING I'VE

01:58.233 --> 01:59.133
LEARNED ABOUT THAT STATE THAT

01:59.200 --> 02:03.600
I'VE ACTUALLY LIKED.

02:03.666 --> 02:04.366
ASIDE, OF COURSE, FROM THE FACT

02:04.433 --> 02:05.266
THAT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE CITY

02:05.333 --> 02:07.600
OF DANBURY, CONNECTICUT.

02:07.666 --> 02:08.433
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE:

02:08.500 --> 02:09.400
FUCK DANBURY!

02:09.466 --> 02:10.833

02:14.433 --> 02:15.766
THE WEEK STEERING HARD TOWARD

02:15.833 --> 02:17.100
THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.

02:17.166 --> 02:18.233
BECAUSE WHILE, YES, THERE WERE

02:18.300 --> 02:19.500
BRIEF APPEARANCES FROM STARS

02:19.566 --> 02:21.233
LIKE AOC AND STACEY ABRAMS,

02:21.300 --> 02:22.966
A LOT OF TIME WAS GIVEN TO

02:23.033 --> 02:25.133
REPUBLICANS LIKE MEG WHITMAN,

02:25.200 --> 02:26.933
COLIN POWELL, AND JOHN KASICH,

02:27.000 --> 02:27.966
WHO DELIVERED HIS REMARKS

02:28.033 --> 02:28.766
STANDING AT A LITERAL

02:28.833 --> 02:30.000
CROSSROADS.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.100
AND IT'S HARD TO CONVINCE

02:32.166 --> 02:33.100
PROGRESSIVE VOTERS THAT YOU'RE

02:33.166 --> 02:34.466
A FORWARD-LOOKING PARTY WHEN

02:34.533 --> 02:35.866
YOUR CONVENTION FEELS LIKE A

02:35.933 --> 02:40.600
ZOOM CAST REUNION, EXCEPT

02:40.666 --> 02:41.666
THE SHOW IS THE 2008 RNC.

02:41.733 --> 02:43.133
AS FOR BIDEN, HIS NOMINATION

02:43.200 --> 02:44.166
SPEECH ALSO PLAYED IT SAFE,

02:44.233 --> 02:44.900
SHOWCASING HIS WARMTH AND

02:44.966 --> 02:46.033
HIS EMPATHY.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.533
BUT WHILE HE NAME-CHECKED

02:47.600 --> 02:48.933
BROAD GOALS LIKE "EXPANDING

02:49.000 --> 02:53.266
CHILD CARE" OR "ENDING RACISM,"

02:53.333 --> 02:54.400
THE SPEECH WAS LIGHT ON DETAIL

02:54.466 --> 02:55.633
AND HEAVY ON LINES LIKE THIS:

02:55.700 --> 02:56.333
>> THIS WILL DETERMINE WHAT

02:56.400 --> 02:57.400
AMERICA IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE

02:57.466 --> 02:58.833
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.266
CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.700
COMPASSION IS ON THE BALLOT.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.133
DECENCY, SCIENCE, DEMOCRACY.

03:05.200 --> 03:10.766
THEY'RE ALL ON THE BALLOT.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.400
>> John: OKAY GO NUMB OUT NOW

03:12.466 --> 03:15.566
NORMALLY, I WOULD POINT OUT THAT

03:15.633 --> 03:16.833
PASSION AND DECENCY ARE NOT

03:16.900 --> 03:18.100
CONCRETE POLICY AGENDAS, BUT

03:18.166 --> 03:19.166
CONSIDERING OPEN

03:19.233 --> 03:20.133
AUTHORITARIANISM IS ALSO ON THE

03:20.200 --> 03:20.833
BALLOT, SURE, WHAT THE FUCK --

03:20.900 --> 03:21.566
ADEQUATE VS. EVIL.

03:21.633 --> 03:22.666
LET'S GO.

03:22.733 --> 03:23.633
AND I'M HONESTLY NOT SAYING IT'S

03:23.700 --> 03:24.766
A MISTAKE FOR THE DNC TO SPEND

03:24.833 --> 03:25.700
FOUR DAYS POINTING OUT THAT

03:25.766 --> 03:26.666
JOE BIDEN'S NOT DONALD TRUMP.

03:26.733 --> 03:28.933
IT'S A VERY ATTRACTIVE QUALITY.

03:29.000 --> 03:29.900
BUT SPENDING SO MUCH OF THEIR

03:29.966 --> 03:31.466
CONVENTION UNDERSCORING TRUMP'S

03:31.533 --> 03:32.866
UNFITNESS FOR OFFICE MAY'VE BEEN

03:32.933 --> 03:34.133
REDUNDANT, GIVEN THAT TRUMP

03:34.200 --> 03:35.800
SPENT THE ENTIRE WEEK BASICALLY

03:35.866 --> 03:37.166
MAKING THAT CASE FOR THEM,

03:37.233 --> 03:38.500
BY CONTINUING TO SOW DISTRUST

03:38.566 --> 03:40.466
OF VOTING BY MAIL, CALLING FOR

03:40.533 --> 03:41.666
A BOYCOTT OF AN AMERICAN COMPANY

03:41.733 --> 03:42.900
THAT EMPLOYS OVER 60,000

03:42.966 --> 03:44.933
WORKERS, AND REFUSING TO DISAVOW

03:45.000 --> 03:46.366
THE QANON CONSPIRACY THEORY.

03:46.433 --> 03:47.700
BUT AS APPALLING AND

03:47.766 --> 03:49.000
UNSURPRISING AS ALL OF THAT IS,

03:49.066 --> 03:51.866
THE BIGGEST NEWS REGARDING HIM

03:51.933 --> 03:52.700
ACTUALLY GOT BURIED THIS WEEK,

03:52.766 --> 03:53.900
AND IT WAS THIS:

03:54.000 --> 03:55.533
>> TONIGHT, THE REPUBLICAN-LED

03:55.600 --> 03:56.533
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

03:56.600 --> 03:58.233
RELEASING ITS FINAL REPORT,

03:58.300 --> 04:00.900
DECLARING THE 2016 TRUMP

04:00.966 --> 04:02.700
CAMPAIGN HAD REPEATED CONTACTS

04:02.766 --> 04:04.600
WITH RUSSIAN OPERATIVES.

04:04.666 --> 04:05.933
>> John: YEAH, THE SENATE'S

04:06.000 --> 04:07.300
REPORT CONFIRMED TRUMP'S

04:07.366 --> 04:08.633
CAMPAIGN WAS UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE

04:08.700 --> 04:09.833
TO RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE.

04:09.900 --> 04:13.200
IT'S SOMETHING WE ALREADY KNEW,

04:13.266 --> 04:14.133
BUT IT'S STILL NICE TO HAVE IT

04:14.200 --> 04:15.666
IN WRITING, LIKE WHEN YOUR DAD

04:15.733 --> 04:16.266
SIGNS A BIRTHDAY CARD WITH

04:16.333 --> 04:17.166
"I LOVE YOU."

04:17.233 --> 04:18.600
SURE, HE MAY NOT BE EMOTIONALLY

04:18.666 --> 04:19.700
READY TO SAY IT OUT LOUD, BUT AT

04:19.766 --> 04:20.500
LEAST HE HAD YOUR MOM SCRIBBLE

04:20.565 --> 04:23.333
IT ON TOP OF GARFIELD'S ASS.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.766
THAT'S NOT NOTHING, IS IT?

04:24.833 --> 04:26.033
THIS REPORT HAS NEW DETAILS, AND

04:26.100 --> 04:27.733
CITES TRUMP'S FORMER CAMPAIGN

04:27.800 --> 04:29.000
MANAGER, PAUL MANAFORT'S

04:29.066 --> 04:29.933
WILLINGNESS TO SHARE INFORMATION

04:30.000 --> 04:31.400
WITH INDIVIDUALS CLOSELY

04:31.466 --> 04:32.800
AFFILIATED WITH RUSSIAN

04:32.866 --> 04:33.433
INTELLIGENCE AS A GRAVE

04:33.500 --> 04:35.266
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE THREAT.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.700
NOT ONLY THAT, IT DETAILS HOW

04:36.766 --> 04:37.800
ROGER STONE TRIED TO GET

04:37.866 --> 04:38.900
WIKILEAKS TO DROP DAMAGING

04:38.966 --> 04:40.900
EMAILS FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S

04:40.966 --> 04:42.033
CAMPAIGN CHAIR, JUST AS THE

04:42.100 --> 04:42.966
"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" TAPE

04:43.033 --> 04:44.000
CAME OUT.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.433
AND WHILE TRUMP DENIED KNOWLEDGE

04:45.500 --> 04:46.833
OF STONE'S ACTIVITIES TO

04:46.900 --> 04:47.666
ROBERT MUELLER, THIS REPORT HAS

04:47.733 --> 04:49.166
PUT ONE HELL OF AN ASTERISK

04:49.233 --> 04:50.766
ON THAT.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.166
>> THE COMMITTEE ASSESSES THAT

04:52.233 --> 04:53.466
TRUMP DID, IN FACT, SPEAK WITH

04:53.533 --> 04:54.300
STONE ABOUT WIKILEAKS ON

04:54.366 --> 04:56.133
MULTIPLE OCCASIONS.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.166
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE.

04:59.233 --> 05:01.133
AND NOT ONLY DID EVERYONE ASSUME

05:01.200 --> 05:01.800
THAT, BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

05:01.866 --> 05:02.533
TRUMP WOULDN'T HAVE REMEMBERED

05:02.600 --> 05:04.233
THAT CONVERSATION.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.800
HOW WOULD ANYONE FORGET TALKING

05:05.866 --> 05:07.200
TO ROGER STONE, A MAN WHO CAN

05:07.266 --> 05:08.500
BEST BE DESCRIBED AS

05:08.566 --> 05:10.600
VISUALLY TOO FUCKING MUCH?

05:10.666 --> 05:12.033
THE BIPARTISAN REPORT -- WHICH,

05:12.100 --> 05:13.433
REMEMBER, COMES FROM A

05:13.500 --> 05:14.933
REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE COMMITTEE

05:15.000 --> 05:16.500
-- IS A TRULY DAMNING INDICTMENT

05:16.566 --> 05:17.366
OF TRUMP'S CHARACTER,

05:17.433 --> 05:18.933
UNDERSCORING JUST HOW IMPORTANT

05:19.000 --> 05:20.600
THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER IS.

05:20.666 --> 05:22.266
AND AS MUCH AS THE DNC'S

05:22.333 --> 05:24.666
PLATFORM OF "BIDEN IS NOT TRUMP"

05:24.733 --> 05:25.900
SHOULD BE AN OVERWHELMINGLY

05:25.966 --> 05:27.633
SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY, THE TRUTH

05:27.700 --> 05:29.166
IS TRUMP STILL HAS A VERY REAL

05:29.233 --> 05:31.000
CHANCE AT WINNING RE-ELECTION.

05:31.066 --> 05:32.100
TAKE THAT RHODE ISLAND CALIMARI

05:32.166 --> 05:33.166
CHEF.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.000
"THE WASHINGTON POST" TRACKED

05:35.066 --> 05:36.066
HIM DOWN, AND HE SAID HE'S NOT

05:36.133 --> 05:37.466
SURE IF HE'LL VOTE FOR BIDEN

05:37.533 --> 05:38.633
AT ALL, ADDING, HE DOESN'T

05:38.700 --> 05:39.800
KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC

05:39.866 --> 05:40.700
NOMINEE.

05:40.766 --> 05:41.900
AND IT'S PRETTY FRUSTRATING TO

05:41.966 --> 05:43.400
CLAIM YOU'RE ONLY VAGUELY AWARE

05:43.466 --> 05:44.833
OF BIDEN.

05:44.900 --> 05:45.766
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

05:45.833 --> 05:47.333
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT WHO'S BEEN

05:47.400 --> 05:48.300
IN PUBLIC OFFICE FOR NEARLY

05:48.366 --> 05:49.233
50 YEARS, NOT

05:49.300 --> 05:50.266
PENN FUCKING BADGLEY.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.233
AND WHILE YOUR INSTINCTIVE

05:52.300 --> 05:53.433
REACTION MIGHT BE, "HOW THE FUCK

05:53.500 --> 05:55.433
CAN ANYONE STILL BE UNDECIDED?"

05:55.500 --> 05:56.800
THE SAD FACT IS, LOTS OF PEOPLE

05:56.866 --> 05:58.233
STILL ARE.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.800
SO I REALLY HOPE THE DNC'S

05:59.866 --> 06:01.933
STRATEGY THIS WEEK OF WOOING

06:02.000 --> 06:03.433
UNDECIDED VOTERS WITH THE STAR

06:03.500 --> 06:04.633
POWER OF JOHN KASICH AND

06:04.700 --> 06:06.133
MEG WHITMAN PAYS OFF.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.333
BECAUSE IF THE DEMOCRATS JUST

06:07.400 --> 06:09.666
SPENT A WEEK WOOING CONSERVATIVE

06:09.733 --> 06:11.800
WHO ULTIMATELY END

06:11.866 --> 06:13.800
UP VOTING REPUBLICAN, THEN THIS

06:13.866 --> 06:15.100
WILL HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE

06:15.166 --> 06:15.666
A DEPRESSINGLY CONVENTIONAL

06:15.733 --> 06:16.333
CONVENTION.

06:16.400 --> 06:20.500

06:23.066 --> 06:24.900
GUESS WHO'S BACK?

06:51.133 --> 06:53.066
SOON ALL OF EXISTENCE SHALL BE

06:53.133 --> 06:54.166
CRADLED IN THE FRAGRANT PUMPKIN

06:58.800 --> 07:00.000

07:01.333 --> 07:03.100
>> NO, I'M NOT EITHER.

07:03.166 --> 07:03.666
>> WE JUST WANT THE REGULAR

07:03.733 --> 07:04.733
COFFEE.

07:04.800 --> 07:08.033
>> YOU CAN'T HAVE IT!

07:08.100 --> 07:11.333
REGULAR COFFEE LIKE THE PRECIOUS

07:11.400 --> 07:16.000
TOUCH OF A MORTAL FRIEND IS

07:16.066 --> 07:17.033
NOTHING BUT A FADED MEMORY!

>> 2020 HAS BEEN, MIGHT I SAY, A

07:35.100 --> 07:37.600
DUMPSTER FIRE.

JUST LET THEM HAVE THE PUMPKIN

07:40.233 --> 07:43.500
SPICE, RIGHT?

07:43.566 --> 07:44.333

07:44.400 --> 07:45.366
PUMPKIN SPICE IS ALL WE HAVE

07:45.433 --> 07:47.300
LEFT!

07:47.366 --> 07:48.566
♪ ♪

07:48.633 --> 07:49.600
>> John: MOVING ON.

07:49.666 --> 07:50.833
FOR OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,

07:50.900 --> 07:51.700
WE THOUGHT WE'D LOOK AT

07:51.766 --> 07:55.933
THE BORDER WALL.

07:56.000 --> 07:56.766
ONE OF THE MORE UPSETTING

07:56.833 --> 07:57.400
THINGS FROM 2016, TIED WITH THE

07:57.466 --> 07:59.666
REBOOT OF "GILMORE GIRLS."

07:59.733 --> 08:00.866
I KNOW I'M A LITTLE BIT LATE

08:00.933 --> 08:04.600
WITH THIS BUT JUST A FEW NOTES.

08:04.666 --> 08:05.133
ONE, WHO THE FUCK WAS PAUL?

08:05.200 --> 08:08.833
NOT ENOUGH PARIS.

08:08.900 --> 08:12.266
WWHO THE FUCK WAS

08:12.333 --> 08:13.000
WHEN DID BOTH OF THESE WOMEN

08:13.066 --> 08:13.233
PAUL?

08:13.300 --> 08:13.966
FORGET HOW TO HOLD A CUP?

08:14.033 --> 08:14.966
WHO THE ABSOLUTE FUCK WAS PAUL?

08:15.033 --> 08:17.633
#TeamLoganForLife.

08:17.700 --> 08:18.733
IT WAS THE KEY PROMISE OF

08:18.800 --> 08:20.333
TRUMP'S FIRST CAMPAIGN.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.433
HE TALKED ABOUT IT CONSTANTLY,

08:22.500 --> 08:23.700
EVEN FAMOUSLY MANAGING TO

08:23.766 --> 08:24.633
INADVERTENTLY POINT OUT KEY

08:24.700 --> 08:27.066
FLAWS IN THE IDEA, LIKE THIS:

08:27.133 --> 08:28.200
>> THERE'S NO LADDER GOING

08:28.266 --> 08:29.166
OVER THAT.

08:29.233 --> 08:30.733
IF THEY EVER GET UP THERE,

08:30.800 --> 08:31.866
THEY'RE IN TROUBLE, BECAUSE

08:31.933 --> 08:33.400
THERE'S NO WAY TO GET DOWN.

08:33.466 --> 08:34.433
MAYBE A ROPE.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.100
>> John: YEAH, MAYBE A ROPE.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.566
THAT WAS TRUMP, RECOGNIZING IN

08:37.633 --> 08:38.933
REAL TIME THAT HIS SIGNATURE

08:39.000 --> 08:40.066
PLAN COULD BE COMPLETELY UNDONE

08:40.133 --> 08:42.299
BY THICK STRING.

08:42.366 --> 08:44.800
IF THAT CLIP'S FAMILIAR TO YOU,

08:44.866 --> 08:45.866
IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE WE PLAYED IT

08:45.933 --> 08:47.166
IN OUR FIRST PIECE ON THE WALL

08:47.233 --> 08:48.300
FOUR YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS

08:48.366 --> 08:49.566
APPROXIMATELY 50 YEARS YOUNGER.

08:49.633 --> 08:52.033
AND IN THAT SHOW, WE DISCUSSED

08:52.100 --> 08:52.766
HOW THE WALL SEEMED -- IN

08:52.833 --> 08:53.600
ADDITION TO BEING TRANSPARENTLY

08:53.666 --> 08:55.200
RACIST -- LIKE IT WAS GOING TO

08:55.266 --> 08:56.900
BE BOTH EXPENSIVE AND POINTLESS.

08:56.966 --> 08:59.066
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE

08:59.133 --> 09:00.400
NOTICED, BUT TRUMP IS PRESIDENT

09:00.466 --> 09:01.500
NOW, AND HAS SPENT THE LAST

09:01.566 --> 09:02.400
THREE AND A HALF YEARS PUTTING

09:02.466 --> 09:03.600
HIS PLAN INTO ACTION.

09:03.666 --> 09:04.800
IN FACT, JUST BEFORE THE

09:04.866 --> 09:06.233
PANDEMIC, HE WAS REASSURING

09:06.300 --> 09:07.300
ATTENDEES AT A RALLY THAT THINGS

09:07.366 --> 09:08.566
WERE GOING GREAT.

09:08.633 --> 09:11.600
>> WE'LL SOON BE BUILDING MANY

09:11.666 --> 09:12.600
MANY MILES A WEEK, BUT WE'RE UP

09:12.666 --> 09:14.366
TO OVER 125.

09:14.433 --> 09:17.533
I GUESS, 127 OR 28 MILES OF THIS

09:17.600 --> 09:19.300
SUPER-DUPER WALL, SUPER-DUPER.

09:19.366 --> 09:20.900
>> John: I'M SORRY,

09:20.966 --> 09:22.200
"THE SUPER-DUPER WALL?"

09:22.266 --> 09:23.566
THAT SOUNDS LESS LIKE A

09:23.633 --> 09:24.800
DESCRIPTION OF BORDER FENCING

09:24.866 --> 09:26.333
AND MORE LIKE THE NAME OF AN

09:26.400 --> 09:27.600
OFF-BRAND PLAY SET RECALLED

09:27.666 --> 09:28.633
BECAUSE IT COLLAPSED ON A BUNCH

09:28.700 --> 09:29.866
OF SMALL CHILDREN.

09:29.933 --> 09:31.166
LISTEN TO ME!

09:31.233 --> 09:32.533
DO NOT BUY "THE SUPER-DUPER

09:32.600 --> 09:33.033
WALL!"

09:33.100 --> 09:33.866
UNLESS YOU WANT TO WIND UP WITH

09:33.933 --> 09:35.033
A PILE OF CRACKED FIBERGLASS AND

09:35.100 --> 09:36.133
A FLATTENED TODDLER.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.166
BUT CLEARLY, THE WALL IS BY NO

09:38.233 --> 09:39.266
MEANS SUPER-DUPER.

09:39.333 --> 09:40.200
AND WHILE WE PREDICTED THE WHOLE

09:40.266 --> 09:41.866
THING WOULD BE A SHAMBLES,

09:41.933 --> 09:43.300
THE EXTENT TO WHICH THAT'S BEEN

09:43.366 --> 09:44.766
TRUE, EVEN WE DIDN'T SEE COMING.

09:44.833 --> 09:45.733
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED JUST THIS

09:45.800 --> 09:47.033
THURSDAY.

09:47.100 --> 09:48.233
>> STEVE BANNON AND THREE OTHERS

09:48.300 --> 09:50.300
ARE ACCUSED OF DEFRAUDING

09:50.366 --> 09:51.866
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

09:51.933 --> 09:53.533
BY PERSONALLY PROFITING OFF

09:53.600 --> 09:55.400
A SCHEME TO RAISE MONEY TO HELP

09:55.466 --> 09:55.966
BUILD PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

09:56.033 --> 09:57.466
BORDER WALL.

09:57.533 --> 09:59.333
>> John: YEAH, STEVE BANNON,

09:59.400 --> 10:00.700
THE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER

10:00.766 --> 10:01.300
AND FORMER CHIEF STRATEGIST,

10:01.366 --> 10:02.333
WAS ARRESTED!

10:02.400 --> 10:06.033
WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

10:06.100 --> 10:06.800
THAT YOU KNEW WOULD EVENTUALLY

10:06.866 --> 10:07.533
HAPPEN, BUT ARE PLEASANTLY

10:07.600 --> 10:08.266
SURPRISED THAT IT HAPPENED SO

10:08.333 --> 10:09.100
SOON, LIKE JENNIFER LAWRENCE'S

10:09.166 --> 10:10.100
OSCAR WIN, OR ROGER AILES'

10:10.166 --> 10:11.033
DEATH.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.233
AND THE STORY BEHIND THAT ARREST

10:12.300 --> 10:13.500
IS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING, AND I

10:13.566 --> 10:15.033
PROMISE WE'LL GET INTO IT LATER

10:15.100 --> 10:18.133
IN THIS PIECE.

10:18.200 --> 10:18.733
BUT WE THOUGHT THAT TONIGHT --

10:18.800 --> 10:19.766
ESPECIALLY AHEAD OF THE RNC

10:19.833 --> 10:21.133
NEXT WEEK -- IT'D BE A GOOD TIME

10:21.200 --> 10:21.800
TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THE

10:21.866 --> 10:23.533
STATUS OF TRUMP'S BORDER WALL.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.766
BECAUSE BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE,

10:24.833 --> 10:25.600
HE WANTED IT TO DEFINE HIM AS

10:25.666 --> 10:27.200
A PRESIDENT.

10:27.266 --> 10:28.500
AND THAT HAS VERY MUCH HAPPENED,

10:28.566 --> 10:29.633
BUT IN NONE OF THE WAYS

10:29.700 --> 10:30.833
THAT HE INTENDED.

10:30.900 --> 10:32.433
SO LET'S TRY AND BREAK DOWN

10:32.500 --> 10:33.666
A FEW THINGS: WHAT HE'S BUILT,

10:33.733 --> 10:35.066
WHAT DAMAGE IT'S DONE, AND

10:35.133 --> 10:36.266
CRUCIALLY, WHO'S BEEN DOING

10:36.333 --> 10:37.766
SOME OF THE BUILDING.

10:37.833 --> 10:38.766
AND LET'S START WITH WHAT,

10:38.833 --> 10:40.133
EXACTLY, HE HAS BUILT.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.500
BECAUSE FROM THE START, TRUMP

10:41.566 --> 10:42.766
INSISTED THAT HE WANTED A

10:42.833 --> 10:44.966
CONCRETE WALL -- SOMETHING MANY

10:45.033 --> 10:46.166
BORDER PATROL AGENTS HAD ADVISED

10:46.233 --> 10:47.600
HIM AGAINST BECAUSE IT WOULD

10:47.666 --> 10:48.433
BLOCK THEIR VIEW OF WHAT WAS

10:48.500 --> 10:49.733
GOING ON BEHIND IT.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.400
YET TRUMP WAS STILL SO INSISTENT

10:51.466 --> 10:52.700
ON IT THAT LESS THAN A YEAR INTO

10:52.766 --> 10:54.666
HIS TERM, THIS HAPPENED.

10:54.733 --> 10:56.800
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE

10:56.866 --> 10:57.800
WANTED A BIG, FAT BEAUTIFUL

10:57.866 --> 10:59.600
WALL.

10:59.666 --> 11:01.166
THESE ARE HIS 30 BY 30 FOOT

11:01.233 --> 11:03.133
OPTIONS.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.966
ONE OF THESE EIGHT CONTESTANTS

11:05.033 --> 11:05.566
COULD SOON STRETCH ACROSS THE

11:05.633 --> 11:06.800
BORDER.

11:06.866 --> 11:09.566
>> THERE'S A CHANCE THAT ONE OF

11:09.633 --> 11:11.766
THEM GETS -- ONE OF THEM GETS

11:11.833 --> 11:12.766
SELECTED, EIGHT OF THEM GET

11:12.833 --> 11:13.766
SELECTED, OR A MIX OF THEIR

11:13.833 --> 11:14.866
CHARACTERISTICS GET SELECTED FOR

11:14.933 --> 11:16.700
CONSTRUCTION.

11:16.766 --> 11:17.566
>> John: YEAH, TRUMP ESSENTIALLY

11:17.633 --> 11:18.466
ORGANIZED A WALL PAGEANT.

11:18.533 --> 11:19.666
AND LOOK, IF YOU'RE GOING TO

11:19.733 --> 11:21.200
HOLD A WEIRD CONTEST IN THE

11:21.266 --> 11:22.266
MIDDLE OF THE DESERT, AT LEAST

11:22.333 --> 11:23.566
MAKE IT SAUDI ARABIA'S ACTUAL

11:23.633 --> 11:24.633
BEAUTY PAGEANT FOR CAMELS.

11:24.700 --> 11:27.333
A REAL, ANNUAL EVENT WHERE THE

11:27.400 --> 11:28.866
HOTTEST CAMELS ARE EVALUATED ON

11:28.933 --> 11:30.000
THE "FULLNESS OF THEIR LIPS,

11:30.066 --> 11:32.066
HOW GRACEFULLY THEY WALK, AND

11:32.133 --> 11:32.866
THE SIZE OF THEIR HUMPS."

11:32.933 --> 11:33.733
AND YOU MIGHT BE THINKING, "WOW,

11:33.800 --> 11:35.066
IT'S PRETTY PROBLEMATIC TO

11:35.133 --> 11:36.200
OBJECTIFY CAMELS LIKE THAT,"

11:36.266 --> 11:37.566
BUT THE FACT IS, THIS CONTEST IS

11:37.633 --> 11:38.800
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST

11:38.866 --> 11:39.733
SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THEY

11:39.800 --> 11:40.833
HAVE.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.533
AND DO YOU REALLY THINK NOW IS

11:42.600 --> 11:43.900
THE TIME TO ARGUE WE NEED FEWER

11:43.966 --> 11:46.066
CAMELS IN STEM?

11:46.133 --> 11:46.400
OF COURSE NOT.

11:46.466 --> 11:47.266
GET REAL.

11:47.333 --> 11:48.866
BE AN ALLY.

11:48.933 --> 11:50.800
BUT IT'S TRUE.

11:50.866 --> 11:52.433
EIGHT PROTOTYPES WERE BUILT, SO

11:52.500 --> 11:53.533
THEY COULD TEST THEM TO FIGURE

11:53.600 --> 11:54.666
OUT WHICH WOULD WORK BEST.

11:54.733 --> 11:56.066
AND IT DIDN'T GO WELL.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.466
A GOVERNMENT REPORT FOUND EVERY

11:57.533 --> 11:59.166
MOCK-UP WAS "DEEMED VULNERABLE

11:59.233 --> 12:01.333
TO AT LEAST ONE BREACHING

12:01.400 --> 12:02.366
TECHNIQUE," WITH ONE HAVING

12:02.433 --> 12:04.166
THE "POTENTIAL TO IMPACT

12:04.233 --> 12:04.766
THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF

12:04.833 --> 12:05.500
THE ENTIRE MOCK-UP."

12:05.566 --> 12:08.600
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS.

12:08.666 --> 12:09.566
WE ALL KNOW THE ONLY WALL THAT

12:09.633 --> 12:10.366
SHOULD BE IN DANGER OF

12:10.433 --> 12:11.166
COLLAPSING IS THE

12:11.233 --> 12:12.033
"SUPER-DUPER WALL!"

12:12.100 --> 12:13.000
I'M SERIOUS -- DO NOT BUY THAT

12:13.066 --> 12:13.933
WALL!

12:14.000 --> 12:16.566
IT WILL SQUISH YOUR CHILD

12:16.633 --> 12:16.900
LIKE A PANINI.

12:16.966 --> 12:18.300
SO THE DESIGN THEY ENDED UP

12:18.366 --> 12:19.966
GOING WITH WAS A WALL OF SLATS,

12:20.033 --> 12:22.766
OR BOLLARDS, TOPPED BY A METAL

12:22.833 --> 12:24.500
ANTI-CLIMBING PLATE.

12:24.566 --> 12:25.466
AND TRUMP DID NOT LIKE THAT,

12:25.533 --> 12:26.666
REPORTEDLY TELLING OFFICIALS

12:26.733 --> 12:27.900
"HE THINKS IT'S UGLY."

12:27.966 --> 12:28.800
AND I HAVE TO SAY -- HE'S NOT

12:28.866 --> 12:29.966
ACTUALLY WRONG THERE.

12:30.033 --> 12:31.666
I DON'T MEAN TO WALL-SHAME,

12:31.733 --> 12:33.266
BUT IF I HAD A LIST OF HOT

12:33.333 --> 12:34.433
WALLS, THAT ONE WOULDN'T CRACK

12:34.500 --> 12:35.400
THE TOP 30.

12:35.466 --> 12:36.733
THIS STONE WALL?

12:36.800 --> 12:37.766
SCORCHING HOT.

12:37.833 --> 12:41.100
THIS WOODEN ONE?

12:41.166 --> 12:41.766
CALL ME TOMORROW, YOU BIG

12:41.833 --> 12:43.000
TEASE.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.166
THIS HUMAN WALL?

12:44.233 --> 12:45.066
I THINK WE ALL KNOW I FEEL ABOUT

12:45.133 --> 12:45.833
THAT.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.266
COLLAPSE ON MY CHEST,

12:47.333 --> 12:48.200
YOU IMPENETRABLE BARRIER.

12:48.266 --> 12:49.433
CRUSH MY RIB CAGE, YOU

12:49.500 --> 12:52.200
LOAD-BEARING BEHEMOTH.

12:52.266 --> 12:53.433
BUT THIS BORDER WALL?

12:53.500 --> 12:55.100
NO, THANK YOU.

12:55.166 --> 12:55.933
THAT'S A HARD PASS FROM BOTH ME

12:56.000 --> 12:57.366
AND THE PRESIDENT.

12:57.433 --> 12:58.633
STILL, TRUMP INSISTS THAT

12:58.700 --> 13:00.733
REGARDLESS OF HOW IT LOOKS,

13:00.800 --> 13:01.733
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,

13:01.800 --> 13:04.333
IT WORKS.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.566
>> WE ACTUALLY BUILT PROTOTYPES

13:06.633 --> 13:08.233
AND WE HAVE, I GUESS YOU COULD

13:08.300 --> 13:09.466
SAY, WORLD-CLASS MOUNTAIN

13:09.533 --> 13:10.933
CLIMBERS.

13:11.000 --> 13:11.833
WE GOT CLIMBERS.

13:11.900 --> 13:12.800
WE HAD 20 MOUNTAIN

13:12.866 --> 13:13.900
CLIMBERS -- THAT'S ALL THEY DO,

13:13.966 --> 13:14.933
THEY LOVE TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS.

13:15.000 --> 13:15.466
THEY CAN HAVE IT.

13:15.533 --> 13:16.500
ME, I DON'T WANT TO CLIMB

13:16.566 --> 13:17.133
MOUNTAINS.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.700
BUT THEY'RE VERY GOOD.

13:18.766 --> 13:20.333
AND SOME OF 'EM WERE CHAMPIONS.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.466
AND WE GAVE THEM DIFFERENT

13:21.533 --> 13:22.933
PROTOTYPES OF WALLS.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
AND THIS WAS THE ONE THAT WAS

13:24.066 --> 13:25.200
HARDEST TO CLIMB.

13:25.266 --> 13:26.833
>> John: OKAY, HOLD ON.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.333
THERE'S NO NEED FOR TRUMP TO SAY

13:28.400 --> 13:29.366
"I DON'T WANT TO CLIMB

13:29.433 --> 13:30.466
MOUNTAINS."

13:30.533 --> 13:31.566
THAT WAS -- AND I CANNOT STRESS

13:31.633 --> 13:33.166
THIS ENOUGH -- ASSUMED.

13:33.233 --> 13:34.400
IF I KNEW NOTHING ELSE ABOUT

13:34.466 --> 13:35.800
DONALD TRUMP, BASED SOLELY ON

13:35.866 --> 13:37.266
HIS APPEARANCE, I'D IMMEDIATELY

13:37.333 --> 13:38.100
MAKE THREE ASSUMPTIONS:

13:38.166 --> 13:39.566
BAD KNEES.

13:39.633 --> 13:39.866
WEIRD DICK.

13:39.933 --> 13:41.033
DOESN'T WANT TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS.

13:41.100 --> 13:41.766
HE'S GIVING ME INFORMATION

13:41.833 --> 13:43.766
I ALREADY HAVE.

13:43.833 --> 13:45.233
AND OBVIOUSLY, THAT CLAIM IS

13:45.300 --> 13:46.366
BULLSHIT, NOT JUST BECAUSE

13:46.433 --> 13:48.400
NOBODY'S BEEN ABLE TO FIND THOSE

13:48.466 --> 13:49.833
CHAMPION CLIMBERS, BUT ALSO

13:49.900 --> 13:51.033
BECAUSE OF THIS:

13:51.100 --> 13:52.066
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CALLED

13:52.133 --> 13:52.900
THESE REFURBISHED WALLS

13:52.966 --> 13:56.300
UNCLIMBABLE.

13:56.366 --> 13:57.766
BUT THIS VIDEO POSTED JUST

13:57.833 --> 13:59.266
YESTERDAY ON SOCIAL MEDIA SHOWS

13:59.333 --> 14:00.833
TWO MEN SCALING A REPLACED

14:00.900 --> 14:01.600
PORTION OF THE WALL IN

14:01.666 --> 14:02.833
CALIFORNIA.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.433
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE!

14:04.500 --> 14:06.766
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A ROPE IF IT

14:06.833 --> 14:08.066
CAN FUNCTION LIKE A FIREMAN'S

14:08.133 --> 14:09.066
POLE.

14:09.133 --> 14:09.933
SO TO RECAP WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

14:10.000 --> 14:10.966
ABOUT WALLS SO FAR: FUCKABLE.

14:11.033 --> 14:12.000
DEFINITELY FUCKABLE.

14:12.066 --> 14:13.200
AND VERY MUCH CLIMBABLE.

14:13.266 --> 14:14.800
SO THAT IS WHAT THE WALL

14:14.866 --> 14:15.766
LOOKS LIKE.

14:15.833 --> 14:16.666
THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHERE,

14:16.733 --> 14:17.966
EXACTLY, ARE WE BUILDING IT?

14:18.033 --> 14:19.600
WELL, AS WE POINTED OUT IN OUR

14:19.666 --> 14:21.633
FIRST PIECE, FINDING PLACES

14:21.700 --> 14:22.533
WHERE YOU CAN BUILD THE WALL IS

14:22.600 --> 14:23.466
A BIT OF A CHALLENGE.

14:23.533 --> 14:24.433
UNDER PRESIDENTS CLINTON, BUSH,

14:24.500 --> 14:25.733
AND OBAMA, HUNDREDS OF MILES OF

14:25.800 --> 14:27.833
BORDER BARRIER HAD ALREADY BEEN

14:27.900 --> 14:28.766
CONSTRUCTED, AND MUCH OF THE

14:28.833 --> 14:29.700
REST OF THE BORDER IS ALREADY

14:29.766 --> 14:30.900
COVERED BY NATURAL BARRIERS,

14:30.966 --> 14:33.333
OR IS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.500
SO WHAT TRUMP DID WAS START

14:34.566 --> 14:35.600
BUILDING IN THE PLACES WHERE IT

14:35.666 --> 14:36.933
WAS EASIEST TO DO THAT --

14:37.000 --> 14:37.933
SPECIFICALLY, WHERE BARRIERS

14:38.000 --> 14:39.333
WERE ALREADY IN PLACE.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.466
IN FACT, OF THE 275 MILES OF

14:41.533 --> 14:43.466
NEW WALL TRUMP HAS COMPLETED

14:43.533 --> 14:45.800
TO DATE, ONLY FIVE MILES ARE IN

14:45.866 --> 14:46.900
LOCATIONS WHERE NO BARRIERS

14:46.966 --> 14:50.300
AT ALL PREVIOUSLY EXISTED.

14:50.366 --> 14:51.400
IT MIGHT BE TEMPTING TO THINK,

14:51.466 --> 14:52.033
"OH, WELL, THEN HE HASN'T DONE

14:52.100 --> 14:52.866
VERY MUCH, HAS HE?"

14:52.933 --> 14:53.800
BUT TRUMP'S ACTING SECRETARY OF

14:53.866 --> 14:55.366
HOMELAND SECURITY, A MAN NAMED

14:55.433 --> 14:56.733
CHAD WOLF, PUSHES BACK ON THAT

14:56.800 --> 14:57.833
CLAIM, HARD.

14:57.900 --> 14:58.766
>> AND YOU PUT UP WHAT'S BEHIND

14:58.833 --> 14:59.666
US.

14:59.733 --> 15:00.766
THAT'S NOT REPLACEMENT WALL.

15:00.833 --> 15:01.533
THAT IS A NEW WALL.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.566
THAT IS A NEW PHYSICAL

15:02.633 --> 15:03.933
INFRASTRUCTURE.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.300
I JUST -- I DON'T -- I DON'T

15:05.366 --> 15:06.700
AGREE WITH THE ASSERTION THAT

15:06.766 --> 15:09.633
WE'RE SIMPLY REPLACING WALL.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.266
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, LET'S DEAL

15:10.333 --> 15:11.066
WITH THE SHEER "CHAD WOLF"-INESS

15:11.133 --> 15:14.033
OF THIS MAN.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.066
IF I LOST ALL MY MEMORIES AND

15:15.133 --> 15:15.833
FELL INTO A COMA FOR 30 YEARS,

15:15.900 --> 15:16.833
OPENED MY EYES, AND SAW HIM,

15:16.900 --> 15:17.700
THE FIRST WORDS OUT OF MY MOUTH

15:17.766 --> 15:19.100
WOULD BE, "YOU MUST BE

15:19.166 --> 15:20.233
CHAD WOLF."

15:20.300 --> 15:21.333
HE LOOKS LIKE THE MODEL FOR A

15:21.400 --> 15:24.000
KNOCKOFF "TOP GUN" COSTUME

15:24.066 --> 15:24.866
YOU FIND AT PARTY CITY CALLED,

15:24.933 --> 15:25.500
"TOP FLIGHT FAST PILOT COSTUME:

15:25.566 --> 15:26.533
USA!"

15:26.600 --> 15:27.533
HE LOOKS LIKE HIS PARENTS

15:27.600 --> 15:28.200
STARTED WITH THE NAME

15:28.266 --> 15:29.433
"CHAD WOLF" AND THEN FOUND

15:29.500 --> 15:30.833
A BABY TO MATCH.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.700
BUT HE IS ACTUALLY RIGHT THERE.

15:32.766 --> 15:33.866
THE REPLACEMENT WALL IS

15:33.933 --> 15:35.066
A COMPLETELY NEW PHYSICAL

15:35.133 --> 15:41.000
INFRASTRUCTURE.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.766
I'LL SHOW YOU: HERE IS THE OLD

15:42.833 --> 15:43.633
BARRIER IN A REMOTE SECTION OF

15:43.700 --> 15:44.600
ARIZONA.

15:44.666 --> 15:45.233
HERE IS THE NEW STRUCTURE.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.100
THOSE ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.033
CLAIMING THAT THEY'RE THE SAME

15:47.100 --> 15:48.066
BECAUSE THEY'RE TECHNICALLY

15:48.133 --> 15:48.966
BARRIERS IS LIKE CLAIMING THAT

15:49.033 --> 15:49.700
JOHN CENA AND I ARE THE SAME

15:49.766 --> 15:50.600
BECAUSE WE'RE THE EXACT SAME

15:50.666 --> 15:51.966
AGE AND WE'RE BOTH NAMED JOHN.

15:52.033 --> 15:52.733
SURE, YEAH, ON PAPER, THERE ARE

15:52.800 --> 15:53.766
SOME SIMILARITIES.

15:53.833 --> 15:54.966
BUT WHEN YOU COMPARE THE TWO

15:55.033 --> 15:55.966
SIDE BY SIDE, ONE IS GIGANTIC,

15:56.033 --> 15:57.000
AND THE OTHER LOOKS LIKE IT

15:57.066 --> 15:57.633
MIGHT COLLAPSE IF YOU PRESS ON

15:57.700 --> 15:58.433
IT TOO HARD.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.666
BUT, CRUCIALLY, THESE MASSIVE

15:59.733 --> 16:01.133
NEW BARRIERS ARE CAUSING

16:01.200 --> 16:02.700
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS, DISRUPTING

16:02.766 --> 16:04.766
ANIMALS' MIGRATORY PATTERNS, AND

16:04.833 --> 16:05.633
SLICING UP PEOPLE'S LAND.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.766
AND THE THING IS, FOR WHAT?

16:07.833 --> 16:09.100
IF THIS IS ABOUT STOPPING DRUGS

16:09.166 --> 16:09.700
OR PEOPLE FROM ENTERING THE

16:09.766 --> 16:11.133
COUNTRY, IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING,

16:11.200 --> 16:12.033
MOST OF THAT HAPPENS THROUGH OUR

16:12.100 --> 16:13.666
PORTS OF ENTRY.

16:13.733 --> 16:16.600
AND EVEN THE DEPARTMENT OF

16:16.666 --> 16:17.100
HOMELAND SECURITY'S OWN

16:17.166 --> 16:19.300
INSPECTOR GENERAL ISSUED

16:19.366 --> 16:21.600
A SCATHING REPORT JUST LAST

16:21.666 --> 16:22.633
MONTH SAYING THE ADMINISTRATION

16:22.700 --> 16:23.300
"DID NOT USE A SOUND METHODOLOGY

16:23.366 --> 16:24.366
TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE

16:24.433 --> 16:25.800
INVESTMENTS IN AREAS ALONG THE

16:25.866 --> 16:26.800
BORDER THAT WOULD BEST BENEFIT

16:26.866 --> 16:28.266
FROM PHYSICAL BARRIERS."

16:28.333 --> 16:29.300
IN OTHER WORDS, PUTTING WALLS

16:29.366 --> 16:30.300
WHERE WE'VE BEEN PUTTING THEM

16:30.366 --> 16:32.000
JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

16:32.066 --> 16:33.166
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE JUST HOW

16:33.233 --> 16:34.933
NONSENSICAL, NEW SECTIONS ARE

16:35.000 --> 16:36.100
CURRENTLY GOING UP ALONG

16:36.166 --> 16:37.133
THE TOP OF THESE JAGGED

16:37.200 --> 16:38.000
MOUNTAINS IN A NATIONAL WILDLIFE

16:38.066 --> 16:39.533
REFUGE, WHICH IS JUST UTTERLY

16:39.600 --> 16:41.100
INSANE.

16:41.166 --> 16:41.766
AND THIS IS COSTING A LOT OF

16:41.833 --> 16:43.400
MONEY.

16:43.466 --> 16:44.600
MEXICO, OBVIOUSLY, IS NOT PAYING

16:44.666 --> 16:46.366
FOR THE WALL.

16:46.433 --> 16:47.633
INSTEAD, WE ARE, AND IN THE

16:47.700 --> 16:50.333
DUMBEST WAY POSSIBLE.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.800
SO FAR TRUMP HAS GARNERED

16:51.866 --> 16:54.133
$15 BILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY

16:54.200 --> 16:55.300
FOR THE WALL -- BUT ONLY

16:55.366 --> 16:56.533
$5 BILLION OF THAT WAS PROVIDED

16:56.600 --> 16:57.500
BY CONGRESS.

16:57.566 --> 16:59.033
TRUMP DECLARED A NATIONAL

16:59.100 --> 17:00.266
EMERGENCY AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER

17:00.333 --> 17:01.933
SO HE COULD TAP INTO PENTAGON

17:02.000 --> 17:03.333
ACCOUNTS FOR THE REST.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.633
THAT REDIRECTION OF FUNDS

17:04.700 --> 17:06.200
DIVERTED MONEY THAT HAD BEEN SET

17:06.266 --> 17:07.733
ASIDE FOR THINGS LIKE REPLACING

17:07.800 --> 17:09.433
AN OVERCROWDED MIDDLE SCHOOL ON

17:09.500 --> 17:10.465
A KENTUCKY MILITARY BASE, OR

17:10.532 --> 17:12.465
REPAIRING A DAYCARE FOR SERVICE

17:12.532 --> 17:13.566
MEMBERS' CHILDREN, WHICH

17:13.633 --> 17:14.900
REPORTEDLY SUFFERED FROM SEWAGE

17:15.000 --> 17:16.900
BACKUPS, FLOODING, MOLD, AND

17:16.965 --> 17:17.633
PESTS.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.532
AND WHEN ASKED TO JUSTIFY

17:19.599 --> 17:20.833
THOSE DECISIONS,

17:20.900 --> 17:21.700
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM HAD

17:21.766 --> 17:23.532
A PRETTY AMAZING RATIONALE.

17:23.599 --> 17:24.665
>> LET'S JUST SAY FOR A MOMENT

17:24.733 --> 17:25.665
THAT HE TOOK SOME MONEY OUT OF

17:25.733 --> 17:26.866
THE MILITARY CONSTRUCTION

17:26.933 --> 17:27.800
BUDGET.

17:27.866 --> 17:29.233
I WOULD SAY IT'S BETTER FOR

17:29.300 --> 17:30.433
THE MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS

17:30.500 --> 17:31.666
IN KENTUCKY TO HAVE

17:31.733 --> 17:33.000
A SECURE BORDER.

17:33.066 --> 17:34.900
WE'LL GET THEM THE SCHOOL THEY

17:34.966 --> 17:36.200
NEED, BUT RIGHT NOW, WE'VE GOT

17:36.266 --> 17:37.166
A NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON OUR

17:37.233 --> 17:38.900
HANDS.

17:38.966 --> 17:39.933
>> John: WOW.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.300
EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT IS BAD.

17:41.366 --> 17:42.400
FROM THE IDEA THAT TRUMP'S

17:42.466 --> 17:44.400
NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION

17:44.466 --> 17:44.933
WAS JUSTIFIED -- WHICH IT

17:45.000 --> 17:45.700
WASN'T.

17:45.766 --> 17:47.566
TO THE IDEA THAT HIS VANITY

17:47.633 --> 17:48.266
PROJECT IS "BETTER FOR MIDDLE

17:48.333 --> 17:49.100
SCHOOL KIDS" THAN A NEW SCHOOL,

17:49.166 --> 17:50.300
WHICH IT'S NOT.

17:50.366 --> 17:52.000
TO THAT TIE, WHICH LOOKS LIKE

17:52.066 --> 17:53.200
A CANDY CANE THAT MELTED ON HIS

17:53.266 --> 17:54.666
SHIRT.

17:54.733 --> 17:55.533
IT LOOKS LIKE THE TIE THAT

17:55.600 --> 17:56.000
SANTA CLAUS WEARS TO

17:56.066 --> 17:57.366
ELF FUNERALS.

17:57.433 --> 17:58.300
IT'S THE WORST THING IN THAT

17:58.366 --> 18:00.700
SHOT, WHICH IS SAYING SOMETHING

18:00.766 --> 18:01.466
BECAUSE THAT SHOT ALSO INCLUDES

18:01.533 --> 18:02.700
LINDSEY GRAHAM.

18:02.766 --> 18:03.833
AND THAT BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL

18:03.900 --> 18:05.800
QUESTION: WHO'S BUILDING THIS?

18:05.866 --> 18:07.400
BECAUSE THE ANSWERS TO THAT ARE

18:07.466 --> 18:08.800
ACTUALLY A LITTLE SURPRISING.

18:08.866 --> 18:10.200
JUST LOOK AT ONE OF THE

18:10.266 --> 18:11.566
COMPANIES THAT WAS INVITED TO

18:11.633 --> 18:12.700
TAKE PART IN THAT AMERICA'S NEXT

18:12.766 --> 18:13.500
TOP WALL IN THE DESERT

18:13.566 --> 18:14.733
COMPETITION,

18:14.800 --> 18:15.833
FISHER SAND & GRAVEL.

18:15.900 --> 18:16.800
THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY,

18:16.866 --> 18:18.033
TOMMY FISHER, KNOWS HOW TO CURRY

18:18.100 --> 18:19.600
FAVOR WITH TRUMP.

18:19.666 --> 18:20.633
HERE HE IS ON LAURA INGRAHAM'S

18:20.700 --> 18:22.866
SHOW, GIVING HIM THE HARD SELL.

18:22.933 --> 18:24.833
>> IF HE ALLOWS US TO PLAY IN,

18:24.900 --> 18:26.200
OUR TEAM OF FISHER INDUSTRIES TO

18:26.266 --> 18:28.600
PLAY, I GUARANTEE YOU, NO

18:28.666 --> 18:29.500
DIFFERENT THAN TOM BRADY, ONCE

18:29.566 --> 18:32.033
WE GET IN, WE NEVER COME OUT.

18:32.100 --> 18:32.533
AND IF WE DON'T PERFORM,

18:32.600 --> 18:34.333
THE PRESIDENT CAN FIRE US,

18:34.400 --> 18:35.333
AND THAT'S HOW COMFORTABLE AND

18:35.400 --> 18:36.100
CONFIDENT I AM IS WHEN PEOPLE

18:36.166 --> 18:36.800
SEE WHAT WE REALLY OFFER.

18:36.866 --> 18:37.433
>> I LOVE IT!

18:37.500 --> 18:38.433
I LOVE IT.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.433
I'M NOT TAKING SIDES ON WHICH

18:39.500 --> 18:40.700
PROTOTYPE IS BEST, BUT THIS IS

18:40.766 --> 18:42.100
WHY YOU'RE A GOOD BUSINESSMAN.

18:42.166 --> 18:43.766
>> John: "I LOVE IT!"

18:43.833 --> 18:44.933
I DIDN'T THINK LAURA INGRAHAM

18:45.000 --> 18:46.033
WAS CAPABLE OF THAT LEVEL OF

18:46.100 --> 18:47.200
DELIGHT, BUT IT TURNS OUT HER

18:47.266 --> 18:48.433
LOVE LANGUAGE IS WHITE MEN

18:48.500 --> 18:49.600
BEGGING FOR ATTENTION.

18:49.666 --> 18:50.866
BECAUSE THAT MAN IS THIRSTY

18:50.933 --> 18:52.233
AS FUCK.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.466
"I'LL WIN FOR YOU, DADDY, JUST

18:53.533 --> 18:55.733
LIKE THAT TOM BRADY YOU LIKE!

18:55.800 --> 18:59.333
AND IF I DON'T, YOU CAN FIRE ME

18:59.400 --> 19:00.133
LIKE YOU USED TO ON TV."

19:00.200 --> 19:01.466
AND THAT WAS, BY NO MEANS,

19:01.533 --> 19:02.533
FISHER'S ONLY APPEARANCE ON FOX.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.200
HE WENT ON THE NETWORK TEN TIMES

19:04.266 --> 19:05.466
TO PRAISE THE PRESIDENT AND SELL

19:05.533 --> 19:06.700
HIS WALL.

19:06.766 --> 19:07.800
AND THESE APPEARANCES SEEMED TO

19:07.866 --> 19:09.400
HAVE AN EFFECT.

19:09.466 --> 19:11.300
BECAUSE WHILE BOTH DHS AND THE

19:11.366 --> 19:13.600
ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ACTUALLY

19:13.666 --> 19:14.966
TURNED DOWN FISHER'S INITIAL

19:15.033 --> 19:15.900
WALL DESIGNS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

19:15.966 --> 19:17.233
MEET OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS,

19:17.300 --> 19:18.900
FISHER'S COMPANY WAS

19:18.966 --> 19:20.200
NEVERTHELESS ADDED TO A SMALL

19:20.266 --> 19:21.466
LIST OF PRE-APPROVED BIDDERS

19:21.533 --> 19:22.400
THANKS TO PERSONAL PRESSURE FROM

19:22.466 --> 19:23.566
THE PRESIDENT, WHO -- ACCORDING

19:23.633 --> 19:24.600
TO ONE OF THE SENATORS FROM

19:24.666 --> 19:25.633
FISHER'S HOME STATE -- LIKED

19:25.700 --> 19:26.466
FISHER BECAUSE HE HAD SEEN HIM

19:26.533 --> 19:27.833
ON TELEVISION.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.333
AND OF COURSE HE DID!

19:29.400 --> 19:31.266
TRUMP IS LIKE A SHUT-IN WHO SITS

19:31.333 --> 19:33.366
AT HOME ALL DAY AND ORDERS WHAT

19:33.433 --> 19:34.866
HE SEES ON FOX, BUT INSTEAD OF

19:34.933 --> 19:36.100
ORDERING LEGENDZ XL MALE

19:36.166 --> 19:38.766
ENHANCEMENT PILLS, HE PICKS

19:38.833 --> 19:39.400
COMPANIES TO BUILD A GIANT WALL

19:39.466 --> 19:40.900
ACROSS THE BORDER.

19:40.966 --> 19:43.000
BUT JUST AS WITH BONER PILLS,

19:43.066 --> 19:44.333
YOU SHOULDN'T JUST BUY SOMETHING

19:44.400 --> 19:45.400
BECAUSE YOU SAW IT ON TV.

19:45.466 --> 19:46.666
YOU MIGHT WANT TO AT LEAST

19:46.733 --> 19:47.500
GOOGLE IT FIRST.

19:47.566 --> 19:48.566
BECAUSE FISHER'S COMPANY HAD

19:48.633 --> 19:50.900
A LOT OF OBVIOUS RED FLAGS.

19:50.966 --> 19:52.066
>> FISHER HAS BEEN HIT WITH

19:52.133 --> 19:53.500
LAWSUITS, ONE FROM THE FEDERAL

19:53.566 --> 19:54.000
GOVERNMENT FOR SEXUAL

19:54.066 --> 19:56.100
DISCRIMINATION IN NEW MEXICO.

19:56.166 --> 19:58.033
IT SETTLED FOR 150 GRAND.

19:58.100 --> 19:59.466
THE COMPANY AND THE FOUNDER'S

19:59.533 --> 20:00.300
SON WERE BOTH ACCUSED OF

20:00.366 --> 20:02.100
TAX FRAUD IN 2009.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.500
THE SON PLEADED GUILTY,

20:03.566 --> 20:04.166
THE COMPANY PAID MORE THAN A

20:04.233 --> 20:05.900
MILLION IN BACK TAXES.

20:05.966 --> 20:07.533
>> John: WOW.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.700
SO THEY CHEATED TO GET AHEAD,

20:08.766 --> 20:09.533
GOT CAUGHT, AND YET, THEY'RE

20:09.600 --> 20:11.300
STILL AROUND.

20:11.366 --> 20:12.133
THEY REALLY ARE THE TOM BRADY OF

20:12.200 --> 20:13.466
THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.

20:13.533 --> 20:15.333
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE, BECAUSE

20:15.400 --> 20:17.166
OVER THE YEARS, THEY'VE ALSO

20:17.233 --> 20:18.766
RACKED UP AROUND 2,000 VIOLATION

20:18.833 --> 20:20.400
NOTICES FROM CITY, COUNTY,

20:20.466 --> 20:21.466
STATE, AND FEDERAL REGULATORY

20:21.533 --> 20:23.033
BODIES, INCLUDING 469 CRIMINAL

20:23.100 --> 20:24.966
CHARGES FOR VIOLATIONS IN

20:25.033 --> 20:26.533
PHOENIX, WHERE THE COMPANY RAN

20:26.600 --> 20:28.500
AN ASPHALT PLANT -- CHARGES ONLY

20:28.566 --> 20:29.566
REDUCED TO CIVIL PENALTIES AFTER

20:29.633 --> 20:30.900
FISHER AGREED TO PERMANENTLY

20:30.966 --> 20:35.333
CLOSE IT.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.266
BUT WAIT -- I'M STILL NOT DONE.

20:36.333 --> 20:37.600
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE REJECTED

20:37.666 --> 20:41.200
THEIR BIDS ON CONTRACTS DUE TO

20:41.266 --> 20:42.500
AFTER CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER

20:42.566 --> 20:43.233
THINGS

20:43.300 --> 20:44.566
THE FORMER HEAD OF THEIR FAMILY

20:44.633 --> 20:45.200
OF COMPANIES, FISHER INDUSTRIES,

20:45.266 --> 20:45.833
WAS CONVICTED FOR

20:45.900 --> 20:46.700
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

20:46.766 --> 20:47.533
AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT,

20:47.600 --> 20:49.000
TAX FRAUD, FEDERAL VIOLATIONS,

20:49.066 --> 20:49.766
AND CHILD PORNOGRAPHY IS NOT A

20:49.833 --> 20:51.433
GREAT LIST FOR A COMPANY VYING

20:51.500 --> 20:53.266
TO RECEIVE GOVERNMENT MONEY,

20:53.333 --> 20:54.300
IT'S NOT EVEN A GREAT LIST FOR

20:54.366 --> 20:54.933
THE "OZARK" SEASON FOUR WRITER'S

20:55.000 --> 20:56.466
ROOM.

20:56.533 --> 20:58.633
GUYS, GUYS, THAT'S TOO MUCH.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.100
NOT EVEN JASON BATEMAN CAN MAKE

21:00.166 --> 21:02.100
THOSE CRIMES LIKEABLE!

21:02.166 --> 21:04.333
AND YET, FISHER WAS INCREDIBLY

21:04.400 --> 21:05.400
SAVVY ABOUT HOW TO APPEAL TO

21:05.466 --> 21:07.133
TRUMP -- NOT JUST WITH HIS

21:07.200 --> 21:09.066
CONSTANT TV APPEARANCES, BUT

21:09.133 --> 21:10.466
ALSO BY HOOKING UP WITH "WE

21:10.533 --> 21:12.266
BUILD THE WALL" -- THAT IS THE

21:12.333 --> 21:13.366
NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT

21:13.433 --> 21:14.600
LED TO STEVE BANNON'S ARREST

21:14.666 --> 21:15.833
ON THURSDAY.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.266
IT WAS FOUNDED BY A VETERAN

21:17.333 --> 21:18.266
NAMED BRIAN KOLFAGE, AND IT TOOK

21:18.333 --> 21:19.833
MONEY FROM INDIVIDUAL DONORS,

21:19.900 --> 21:20.966
WITH THE PROMISE THAT IT WOULD

21:21.033 --> 21:21.700
BUILD NEW SECTIONS OF WALL ON

21:21.766 --> 21:23.566
PRIVATE LAND.

21:23.633 --> 21:26.200
IT EVEN HAD A FUNDRAISING

21:26.266 --> 21:27.266
"WALL-A-THON," FEATURING A STAR

21:27.333 --> 21:28.366
TURN FROM A MAN CALLING HIMSELF

21:28.433 --> 21:29.400
"FOREMAN MIKE":

21:29.466 --> 21:30.500
>> WE BUILD THE WALL

21:30.566 --> 21:32.300
CONSTRUCTION.

21:32.366 --> 21:33.800
THEY ARE REAL!

21:33.866 --> 21:35.200
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

21:35.266 --> 21:36.600
WE NEED TO GET DONATIONS IN.

21:36.666 --> 21:38.000
WE WANT TO START.

21:38.066 --> 21:40.366
YOU CAN BUY A BOLLARD PANEL.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.366
PUT YOUR NAME ON IT FOR

21:41.433 --> 21:42.800
ETERNITY, CAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA

21:42.866 --> 21:43.433
LAST FOREVER.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.566
$5,000.

21:44.633 --> 21:46.400
AND IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT,

21:46.466 --> 21:48.266
GET YOURSELF A BRICK.

21:48.333 --> 21:49.966
IT LASTS FOREVER AS WELL WITH

21:50.033 --> 21:51.166
YOUR NAME, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR

21:51.233 --> 21:52.166
GIRLFRIEND, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO

21:52.233 --> 21:52.900
PUT ON IT.

21:52.966 --> 21:54.800
YOU NEED TO DONATE TODAY.

21:54.866 --> 21:56.066
>> John: OKAY, THERE'S A LOT TO

21:56.133 --> 21:57.533
DIGEST THERE.

21:57.600 --> 21:58.900
BECAUSE DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY

21:58.966 --> 22:00.766
THINK, "FOREMAN MIKE" IS NOT

22:00.833 --> 22:01.666
A PROMO FOR A NEW WWE CHARACTER

22:01.733 --> 22:02.933
WHOSE SIGNATURE MOVE IS

22:03.000 --> 22:05.866
"THE CHAOTIC SALES PITCH."

22:05.933 --> 22:07.400
IN FACT, HE ISN'T EVEN THE

22:07.466 --> 22:08.266
FOREMAN ON THE PROJECT, JUST AS

22:08.333 --> 22:09.033
"WE BUILD THE WALL CONSTRUCTION"

22:09.100 --> 22:10.033
IS NOT A REAL CONSTRUCTION

22:10.100 --> 22:11.666
COMPANY.

22:11.733 --> 22:13.600
HE'S JUST SOME GUY THEY USE TO

22:13.666 --> 22:14.633
FUNDRAISE SO HE CAN GRUNT ABOUT

22:14.700 --> 22:15.833
PERSONALIZED BRICKS.

22:15.900 --> 22:17.266
WHICH I DO ADMIT ARE A GREAT

22:17.333 --> 22:18.400
IDEA, BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THE

22:18.466 --> 22:20.600
BEST WAY TO DETER SOMEONE WHO'S

22:20.666 --> 22:21.733
CROSSING THE BORDER IS FOR THEM

22:21.800 --> 22:22.700
TO SEE THE MESSAGE, "TO THE ONE

22:22.766 --> 22:23.766
AND ONLY KIERSTEN, MAY OUR LOVE

22:23.833 --> 22:25.566
BE AS STRONG AS THIS WALL."

22:25.633 --> 22:26.700
AND AS RIDICULOUS AS THAT MAY

22:26.766 --> 22:28.633
SEEM, "WE BUILD THE WALL" RAISED

22:28.700 --> 22:31.433
$25 MILLION.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.500
AND YET, ACCORDING TO THIS

22:32.566 --> 22:33.500
WEEK'S INDICTMENT, QUITE A BIT

22:33.566 --> 22:35.166
OF THAT MONEY WOUND UP GETTING

22:35.233 --> 22:37.166
REDIRECTED BACK TO BANNON AND

22:37.233 --> 22:38.533
KOLFAGE, WHO -- ALONG WITH

22:38.600 --> 22:40.233
OTHERS -- WORKED TOGETHER TO

22:40.300 --> 22:41.666
MISAPPROPRIATE HUNDREDS OF

22:41.733 --> 22:42.966
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR THEIR

22:43.033 --> 22:44.733
OWN PERSONAL BENEFIT.

22:44.800 --> 22:45.800
WITH BANNON ALLEGEDLY USING

22:45.866 --> 22:46.866
MONEY FOR PERSONAL USES AND

22:46.933 --> 22:48.400
EXPENSES, AND KOLFAGE ALLEGEDLY

22:48.466 --> 22:50.900
SPENDING FUNDS ON A LUXURY SUV,

22:50.966 --> 22:51.800
A GOLF CART, JEWELRY, AND

22:51.866 --> 22:53.900
PAYMENTS TOWARD A BOAT.

22:53.966 --> 22:56.366
AND LOOK, BANNON AND KOLFAGE

22:56.433 --> 22:57.500
DENY THOSE CHARGES.

22:57.566 --> 22:58.133
BUT IT DEFINITELY PAINTS THIS

22:58.200 --> 22:59.533
MOMENT FROM THAT "WALL-A-THON"

22:59.600 --> 23:01.200
IN A VERY DIFFERENT LIGHT:

23:01.266 --> 23:01.966
>> WELCOME BACK, THIS IS

23:02.033 --> 23:03.800
STEPHEN K. BANNON.

23:03.866 --> 23:05.366
WE'RE OFF THE COAST OF

23:05.433 --> 23:07.000
SAN TROPEZ IN SOUTHERN FRANCE IN

23:07.066 --> 23:08.600
THE MEDITERRANEAN, WE'RE ON

23:08.666 --> 23:09.666
THE MILLION-DOLLAR YACHT OF

23:09.733 --> 23:12.100
BRIAN KOLFAGE -- BRIAN KOLFAGE,

23:12.166 --> 23:12.700
WHO TOOK ALL THAT MONEY FROM

23:12.766 --> 23:14.266
BUILD THE WALL.

23:14.333 --> 23:15.766
NO, WE'RE ACTUALLY IN

23:15.833 --> 23:17.333
SUNLAND PARK, NEW MEXICO.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.600
>> John: HA HA HA!

23:18.666 --> 23:19.266
I GET IT!

23:19.333 --> 23:20.333
I GET IT!

23:20.400 --> 23:21.666
JOKING ABOUT STEALING PEOPLE'S

23:21.733 --> 23:22.466
MONEY IS FUNNY!

23:22.533 --> 23:24.200
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

23:24.266 --> 23:25.500
ALL GREAT JOKES HAVE AN ELEMENT

23:25.566 --> 23:26.466
OF TRUTH IN THEM.

23:26.533 --> 23:28.133
NOW TRUMP WAS ANXIOUS THIS WEEK

23:28.200 --> 23:29.666
TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM

23:29.733 --> 23:31.200
"WE BUILD THE WALL," SAYING "I

23:31.266 --> 23:32.800
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE PROJECT,"

23:32.866 --> 23:33.433
WHICH IS A LITTLE HARD TO

23:33.500 --> 23:34.666
BELIEVE, BECAUSE HERE'S KOLFAGE

23:34.733 --> 23:35.733
WITH DON, JR., AT AN EVENT WHERE

23:35.800 --> 23:36.700
HE DESCRIBED "WE BUILD THE WALL"

23:36.766 --> 23:37.433
AS "PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AT ITS

23:37.500 --> 23:39.166
FINEST."

23:39.233 --> 23:40.300
AND HERE'S TRUMP ALLY

23:40.366 --> 23:42.100
KRIS KOBACH ON THE GROUP'S OWN

23:42.166 --> 23:43.333
YOUTUBE PAGE, BEING PRETTY

23:43.400 --> 23:44.333
UNEQUIVOCAL ABOUT WHERE THE

23:44.400 --> 23:45.733
PRESIDENT STOOD.

23:45.800 --> 23:46.966
>> I WAS SPEAKING WITH THE

23:47.033 --> 23:48.000
PRESIDENT AND WE WERE TALKING

23:48.066 --> 23:51.133
ABOUT A VARIETY OF ISSUES, AND

23:51.200 --> 23:53.300
THE TOPIC CAME UP -- I MENTIONED

23:53.366 --> 23:55.666
THAT I WAS WORKING WITH WE BUILD

23:55.733 --> 23:57.300
THE WALL, AND HE SAID, WELL, YOU

23:57.366 --> 23:58.366
TELL THE PEOPLE YOU ARE WORKING

23:58.433 --> 23:59.900
WITH THAT THIS PROJECT HAS MY

23:59.966 --> 24:01.533
BLESSING, AND HE WENT FURTHER,

24:01.600 --> 24:03.266
AND HE SAID, I WANT THE MEDIA TO

24:03.333 --> 24:04.233
KNOW THAT THIS PROJECT HAS MY

24:04.300 --> 24:05.800
BLESSING.

24:05.866 --> 24:07.200
HE WAS REALLY MAKING A POINT

24:07.266 --> 24:09.300
THAT HE WAS BEHIND THIS.

24:09.366 --> 24:11.366
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE HE WAS!

24:11.433 --> 24:12.933
I'M JUST SURPRISED KOBACH DIDN'T

24:13.000 --> 24:13.800
CONTINUE, "THIS PRESIDENT WANTED

24:13.866 --> 24:15.066
YOU TO KNOW HE'S COMPLETELY

24:15.133 --> 24:16.200
BEHIND THIS WALL SCAM UNTIL IT

24:16.266 --> 24:17.166
FAILS, AND THEN YOU'LL NOT BE

24:17.233 --> 24:17.866
ABLE TO REACH HIM AND HE WON'T

24:17.933 --> 24:20.866
HAVE HEARD OF YOU.

24:20.933 --> 24:21.500
THAT'S JUST HOW THIS GUY WORKS."

24:21.566 --> 24:23.166
AND LOOK, TO BE FAIR, SOME OF

24:23.233 --> 24:24.366
THAT $25 MILLION THEY RAISED DID

24:24.433 --> 24:25.566
GO TO CONSTRUCTION.

24:25.633 --> 24:27.500
SPECIFICALLY, THEY SAY THEY GAVE

24:27.566 --> 24:29.700
AROUND $10 MILLION OF IT TO

24:29.766 --> 24:30.866
TOMMY FISHER'S COMPANY, MOST OF

24:30.933 --> 24:32.766
IT TO BUILD THAT PRIVATE WALL

24:32.833 --> 24:33.400
IN NEW MEXICO THAT YOU SAW A GUY

24:33.466 --> 24:34.033
NAMED MIKE BANGING WITH A

24:34.100 --> 24:35.233
HAMMER.

24:35.300 --> 24:36.600
AND THAT WALL DOES APPEAR TO

24:36.666 --> 24:37.666
FEATURE SOME PERSONALIZED

24:37.733 --> 24:38.966
BRICKS, LIKE THIS ONE THAT

24:39.033 --> 24:40.266
KOLFAGE EXCITEDLY PUT ON

24:40.333 --> 24:41.400
INSTAGRAM, WHICH SAYS,

24:41.466 --> 24:42.866
"THICC LATINAS WILL NOT BE

24:42.933 --> 24:44.100
DEPORTED," WHICH IS JUST FUCKING

24:44.166 --> 24:45.933
DISGUSTING.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.500
THE GROUP ALSO HELPED FUND

24:47.566 --> 24:49.033
ANOTHER FISHER WALL, BUILT

24:49.100 --> 24:50.666
DIRECTLY ALONG THE RIO GRANDE,

24:50.733 --> 24:53.100
WHICH FISHER REFERRED TO AS THE

24:53.166 --> 24:53.966
LAMBORGHINI OF WALLS, CLAIMING

24:54.033 --> 24:55.233
THAT, "IT'LL STAND FOR

24:55.300 --> 24:56.400
150 YEARS, YOU MARK MY WORDS."

24:56.466 --> 24:57.400
ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS TO BE CONKING

24:57.466 --> 24:59.400
OUT AROUND 149 YEARS AHEAD OF

24:59.466 --> 25:01.700
SCHEDULE.

25:01.766 --> 25:03.200
>> A PROPUBLICA AND

25:03.266 --> 25:04.966
"TEXAS TRIBUNE" INVESTIGATION

25:05.033 --> 25:05.933
FOUND EROSION BENEATH

25:06.000 --> 25:07.966
THE FOUNDATION OF A STRETCH OF

25:08.033 --> 25:09.666
WALL IN TEXAS.

25:09.733 --> 25:11.433
THAT STRETCH WAS JUST BUILT IN

25:11.500 --> 25:13.233
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR BY FISHER

25:13.300 --> 25:15.966
SAND AND GRAVEL.

25:16.033 --> 25:17.100
>> I'M JUST DOING THIS WITH ONE

25:17.166 --> 25:19.833
HAND, NOT EVEN EXERTING MYSELF.

25:19.900 --> 25:20.533
>> John: OKAY, SO

25:20.600 --> 25:21.600
IT TURNS OUT, IT REALLY IS THE

25:21.666 --> 25:22.800
LAMBORGHINI OF WALLS, IN

25:22.866 --> 25:23.666
THAT AS SOON AS YOU GET NEAR IT,

25:23.733 --> 25:24.933
THE OWNER YELLS, "HEY, PLEASE

25:25.000 --> 25:25.533
DON'T TOUCH THAT, IT'LL LOSE

25:25.600 --> 25:26.533
VALUE AND YOU COULD BREAK IT."

25:26.600 --> 25:28.133
AND WHILE I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

25:28.200 --> 25:29.400
FISHER'S ATTORNEY HAS TOLD

25:29.466 --> 25:31.433
REPORTERS THAT EROSION IS A

25:31.500 --> 25:32.800
NORMAL PART OF NEW CONSTRUCTION,

25:32.866 --> 25:34.033
AND THAT IF THERE ARE ISSUES

25:34.100 --> 25:34.833
THAT COME UP, THEY WILL ADDRESS

25:34.900 --> 25:38.366
THAT.

25:38.433 --> 25:40.100
IT SEEMS THERE ARE ISSUES

25:40.166 --> 25:40.566
FUCKING COMING UP.

25:40.633 --> 25:41.500
EXPERTS SAID THAT IT WAS

25:41.566 --> 25:42.666
CONCERNING AND THAT

25:42.733 --> 25:44.066
SEGMENTS OF THE STRUCTURE COULD

25:44.133 --> 25:45.400
TOPPLE INTO THE RIVER IF NOT

25:45.466 --> 25:47.166
FIXED.

25:47.233 --> 25:48.533
SO, TO RECAP: FISHER SAND &

25:48.600 --> 25:49.700
GRAVEL IS A COMPANY WITH A

25:49.766 --> 25:51.100
CHECKERED PAST THAT PARTNERED

25:51.166 --> 25:52.766
WITH A SHADY NONPROFIT WHOSE

25:52.833 --> 25:53.466
BACKERS ARE NOW UNDER INDICTMENT

25:53.533 --> 25:55.066
FOR SKIMMING MONEY FOR THEIR OWN

25:55.133 --> 25:56.233
USES, IN ORDER TO HAVE A FOREMAN

25:56.300 --> 25:56.933
WHO'S NOT THE ACTUAL FOREMAN

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
HELP BUILD A WALL THAT LOOKS

25:58.066 --> 25:58.633
LIKE IT MAY EITHER COLLAPSE

25:58.700 --> 25:59.833
OR GET PUSHED OVER.

25:59.900 --> 26:01.300
AND IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

26:01.366 --> 26:02.633
THIS ADMINISTRATION, IT WILL NOT

26:02.700 --> 26:03.933
SURPRISE YOU TO LEARN THAT

26:04.000 --> 26:05.100
FISHER HAS NOW WOUND UP WITH

26:05.166 --> 26:06.600
OVER $2 BILLION DOLLARS IN

26:06.666 --> 26:08.933
BORDER-BUILDING CONTRACTS.

26:09.033 --> 26:09.766
THEY'RE ONE OF THE BIGGEST

26:09.833 --> 26:11.433
CONTRACTORS THE GOVERNMENT HAS

26:11.500 --> 26:13.366
HIRED FOR THIS PROJECT.

26:13.433 --> 26:14.966
AND THE THING IS, SHOULD TRUMP

26:15.033 --> 26:16.633
BE RE-ELECTED, ALL OF THIS IS

26:16.700 --> 26:17.800
ONLY GOING TO ACCELERATE -- IN

26:17.866 --> 26:19.300
FACT, HIS ADMINISTRATION SEEMS

26:19.366 --> 26:20.466
TO BE STEPPING UP ITS EFFORTS,

26:20.533 --> 26:22.433
ATTEMPTING TO TAKE PRIVATE LAND

26:22.500 --> 26:23.633
BY FILING MORE EMINENT DOMAIN

26:23.700 --> 26:24.333
LAWSUITS DURING THE PANDEMIC

26:24.400 --> 26:25.300
THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN HIS

26:25.366 --> 26:26.600
PRESIDENCY.

26:26.666 --> 26:27.900
AND THEY'RE ALSO USING A

26:27.966 --> 26:29.233
PROVISION TUCKED INTO

26:29.300 --> 26:30.933
THE REAL ID ACT OF 2005, GIVING

26:31.000 --> 26:32.466
THE ADMINISTRATION THE POWER TO

26:32.533 --> 26:34.133
WAIVE ALL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS

26:34.200 --> 26:35.766
NECESSARY TO CONSTRUCT THE WALL.

26:35.833 --> 26:37.733
AND THAT MEANS IT'S NOT BOUND

26:37.800 --> 26:39.400
BY ENVIRONMENTAL OR CULTURAL

26:39.466 --> 26:41.233
HERITAGE PROTECTION LAWS, WHICH

26:41.300 --> 26:42.800
HAS ENABLED THEM TO PLOW THROUGH

26:42.866 --> 26:44.466
NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES,

26:44.533 --> 26:46.566
WITH DEVASTATING EFFECTS.

26:46.633 --> 26:48.033
>> CONSTRUCTION CREWS IN

26:48.100 --> 26:50.400
SOUTHERN ARIZONA CONDUCTED

26:50.466 --> 26:51.566
CONTROLLED BLASTS EARLIER THIS

26:51.633 --> 26:52.700
YEAR ALONG MONUMENT HILL.

26:52.766 --> 26:54.200
>> FIRE IN THE HOLE.

26:54.266 --> 26:55.566
>> THE SAME DAY OF THE

26:55.633 --> 26:57.166
DETONATIONS IN FEBRUARY, THE

26:57.233 --> 26:57.866
TOHONO O'ODHAM TRIBE'S CHAIRMAN

26:57.933 --> 27:00.333
SAT BEFORE CONGRESS.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.966
>> IT'S HARD TO SEE THE BLASTING

27:02.033 --> 27:03.733
THAT YOU SHOWED ON THE VIDEO

27:03.800 --> 27:05.333
TODAY.

27:05.400 --> 27:08.433
THAT AREA IS HOME TO OUR

27:08.500 --> 27:08.700
ANCESTORS.

27:08.766 --> 27:10.366
AND BY BLASTING AND DOING WHAT

27:10.433 --> 27:14.566
WE SAW TODAY, HAS TOTALLY

27:14.633 --> 27:18.433
DISTURBED -- TOTALLY, FOREVER

27:18.500 --> 27:23.266
DAMAGED OUR PEOPLE.

27:23.333 --> 27:25.666
>> John: THAT'S HORRIBLE.

27:25.733 --> 27:27.233
AS THAT MAN TOLD CONGRESS, "FOR

27:27.300 --> 27:28.266
US, THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN

27:28.333 --> 27:29.500
DHS BUILDING A 30-FOOT WALL

27:29.566 --> 27:30.933
ALONG ARLINGTON CEMETERY OR

27:31.000 --> 27:31.966
THROUGH THE GROUNDS OF THE

27:32.033 --> 27:33.566
NATIONAL CATHEDRAL."

27:33.633 --> 27:34.266
AND I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT'S

27:34.333 --> 27:36.100
SOMETHING TRUMP KNOWS WOULD BE

27:36.166 --> 27:37.466
WRONG, BUT WHO KNOWS, GIVEN THAT

27:37.533 --> 27:38.866
HE HAD PEOPLE TEARGASSED SO HE

27:38.933 --> 27:40.533
COULD STAND OUTSIDE A CHURCH,

27:40.600 --> 27:41.100
HOLDING A BIBLE WITH AN

27:41.166 --> 27:41.733
EXPRESSION LIKE IT JUST FUCKED

27:41.800 --> 27:43.533
HIS WIFE.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.100
AND THE DEVASTATION CAUSED BY

27:45.166 --> 27:46.233
THIS WALL WAS COMPLETELY

27:46.300 --> 27:47.700
PREDICTABLE.

27:47.766 --> 27:48.266
I KNOW THAT, BECAUSE WE

27:48.333 --> 27:51.966
LITERALLY PREDICTED IT.

27:52.033 --> 27:52.933
AND BELIEVE ME,

27:53.000 --> 27:53.733
THIS IS THE LAST THING I

27:53.800 --> 27:54.866
WANTED TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO ON.

27:54.933 --> 27:56.166
I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE SAID THAT

27:56.233 --> 27:57.533
ABOUT THE FACT I KNEW PETE AND

27:57.600 --> 27:59.566
ARIANA WEREN'T GOING TO MAKE IT

27:59.633 --> 28:00.766
OR THAT A CROCKPOT WOULD BE THE

28:00.833 --> 28:01.466
KILLER ON "THIS IS US," OR THE

28:01.533 --> 28:02.766
FACT THAT I KNEW THE BABADOOK

28:02.833 --> 28:04.966
WAS GAY AS SOON AS I SAW HIM.

28:05.033 --> 28:07.700
C'MON, GUYS -- THE HAT!

28:07.766 --> 28:09.533
BUT EVEN I DIDN'T SEE SOME OF

28:09.600 --> 28:11.200
THIS COMING -- FROM THE

28:11.266 --> 28:12.933
POINTLESSNESS OF A BEAUTY

28:13.000 --> 28:14.133
CONTEST IN THE DESERT, ALL THE

28:14.200 --> 28:15.166
WAY THROUGH A SKETCHY CHARITY

28:15.233 --> 28:16.466
SELLING PERSONALIZED BRICKS.

28:16.533 --> 28:18.366
ALL OF THIS WAS STUPIDER THAN

28:18.433 --> 28:20.100
EVEN I THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.200
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, THIS WALL

28:22.266 --> 28:23.833
IS NOT A FUNCTIONAL BARRIER.

28:23.900 --> 28:25.600
IF IT'S ANYTHING, IT'S A FUCKING

28:25.666 --> 28:27.666
MONUMENT TO TRUMP.

28:27.733 --> 28:31.733
WHICH ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.

28:31.800 --> 28:32.800
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT HE'S

28:32.866 --> 28:33.600
COMPLETELY OBSESSED WITH HIS

28:33.666 --> 28:34.833
LEGACY.

28:34.900 --> 28:35.666
TRUMP REPORTEDLY EVEN ASKED

28:35.733 --> 28:36.833
SOUTH DAKOTA'S GOVERNOR HOW HE

28:36.900 --> 28:37.433
COULD BE ADDED TO

28:37.500 --> 28:38.866
MOUNT RUSHMORE.

28:38.933 --> 28:40.466
AND WHILE THAT IS CLEARLY NOT

28:40.533 --> 28:41.433
GOING TO HAPPEN -- FOR ONE

28:41.500 --> 28:42.500
THING, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CARVE

28:42.566 --> 28:43.900
STONE INTO WHATEVER FUCKING

28:43.966 --> 28:44.700
SHAPE HIS HAIR IS -- HE ALSO

28:44.766 --> 28:46.300
DOESN'T NEED IT.

28:46.366 --> 28:48.233
BECAUSE THIS IS HIS MONUMENT.

28:48.300 --> 28:49.766
AND THERE'S PERHAPS NOTHING MORE

28:49.833 --> 28:51.400
EMBLEMATIC OF HIS PRESIDENCY

28:51.466 --> 28:53.733
THAN THIS WALL: IT'S

28:53.800 --> 28:55.400
DESTRUCTIVE, POINTLESS,

28:55.466 --> 28:57.600
INEFFECTIVE, RACIST, WEAK, AND

28:57.666 --> 28:59.700
SOMETHING THE DAMAGES OF WHICH

28:59.766 --> 29:01.466
WE'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH

29:01.533 --> 29:02.633
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

29:02.700 --> 29:03.700
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

29:03.766 --> 29:04.866
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

29:04.933 --> 29:05.866
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK,
