You better not be throwing
that football in my house.

00:07.657 --> 00:10.009
And take that helmet off
before you come to dinner.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.403
Did you finish your
"When I grow up" project?

00:13.422 --> 00:15.239
-Yes, ma'am.
-Reggie, can't you think of

00:15.332 --> 00:17.516
anything else you want to be,
other than a football player?

00:17.667 --> 00:18.592
What about a doctor?

00:18.686 --> 00:19.910
Nobody likes the doctor.

00:19.928 --> 00:21.912
Everyone loves football!

00:21.930 --> 00:23.522
I want to be
a football player,

00:23.749 --> 00:26.525
live in a mansion,
and everyone's gonna love me.

00:26.752 --> 00:28.935
Well, everybody in this house
already loves you.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.771
(smooches, laughs)

00:30.923 --> 00:33.181
-Daddy!
-Hey!

00:33.200 --> 00:35.016
I forgot our anniversary.

00:35.110 --> 00:38.037
Luckily, I got celebration
enough for both of us.

00:38.188 --> 00:40.539
Oh, no!
These are for me.

00:40.690 --> 00:41.707
This is for you.

00:41.934 --> 00:43.375
(gasps)

00:43.602 --> 00:46.712
Now, the point
of working hard, son,

00:46.939 --> 00:51.341
is to spoil
the ones you love.

00:52.628 --> 00:54.461
Can I look now?

00:54.613 --> 00:56.446
Okay, okay, okay. Now.

00:56.465 --> 00:58.782
Reggie, you didn't
have to do this.

00:58.951 --> 01:00.117
The hell he didn't!

01:00.210 --> 01:02.469
After how much time
I spent at this boy games?

01:02.563 --> 01:03.711
Thank you, son.

to get back on the team.

That's amazing.

and if what I said
upset you at all, okay?

02:52.656 --> 02:54.989
I did not mean to expose

02:55.009 --> 02:56.249
Not that you should
be ashamed.

02:56.402 --> 02:57.417
You were completely

I just want to move forward.

Dante, Alan,

Maybe go apply to grad school,
huh?

03:35.107 --> 03:36.106
Get out of here.

03:36.199 --> 03:37.090
I failed out of
grad school twice.

yesterday.

Hey, I'm sorry about
what happened last night.

03:47.453 --> 03:49.394
-You okay?
-Not remotely okay.

03:49.580 --> 03:51.788
Sam's gonna go to school today,
and kids are gonna joke about

03:51.807 --> 03:53.065

03:53.216 --> 03:54.900
She messed with my kid.

03:55.051 --> 03:57.402

I want her off the show.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.886

03:58.906 --> 04:00.906
Mm-mm!
I love revenge-Gabby.

04:01.057 --> 04:02.299
What did you have in mind?

04:02.392 --> 04:03.800
I want to challenge her
for her part.

04:03.893 --> 04:05.802
See, that's tricky though,
because if I let you do that,

04:05.895 --> 04:06.803
then I gotta let everyone--

04:06.972 --> 04:08.154
Not if you have to
win a contest first.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.474
The prize is
a challenge ticket.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.476
I have a whole plan,
it's gonna be great TV,

04:12.494 --> 04:14.419
and at the end of it,
Brittney's going down.

04:14.571 --> 04:17.814
First, revenge-Gabby,
then premeditated murder-Gabby.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.240

04:19.260 --> 04:21.242

going to kill her,

a camera there, huh?

04:25.266 --> 04:27.933

you're joking or not.

04:48.196 --> 04:51.364
Hey, I would've
suspended me too, okay?

08:41.930 --> 08:42.912
I feel close to you.

08:42.931 --> 08:44.247
Forgive me for
having team spirit.

08:44.266 --> 08:47.250
All right, look,
I'ma make this happen.

08:47.269 --> 08:50.103
Good luck, kid.
You have quite a hill to climb.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.680
-I thought I fired you.
-Nah, I'm here as a volunteer.

08:52.732 --> 08:53.681
Here we go.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.017
Oh, God, what is the show?

08:56.111 --> 08:58.620
It has to be cohesive
with a clear narrative.

09:00.265 --> 09:01.522
I don't know what I'm doing.

09:01.691 --> 09:02.615
If I don't figure it out,

09:02.859 --> 09:04.025
I'll have to get
my real estate license,

09:04.269 --> 09:07.212
and let's be honest,
would you buy a house from me?

09:07.363 --> 09:09.956
Yeah, probably not.
Costumes needs an answer.

09:10.033 --> 09:11.107
They're both awful.

09:11.126 --> 09:14.035
Sounds like
you're creatively blocked.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.945
Oh, do you have
a PhD in psychology?

09:15.964 --> 09:17.038
No, just a master's.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.040
But as a creative, I get it.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.309
When I need inspiration...

09:22.954 --> 09:24.045
I go see Frank.

09:24.139 --> 09:25.880
Who the hell's Frank?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.899
He's a shaman.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.884
He's also a Teamster.
He drives van five.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.385
Hey, Monica, new deal today.

09:31.479 --> 09:33.296
-No square dancing?
-No, thank God.

09:33.315 --> 09:35.315
We're having a dance contest.
It's gonna be maximum drama.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.075
Everyone dances
in their own style,

09:37.302 --> 09:38.484
which gives them a chance
to sort of show off,

09:38.637 --> 09:39.894
and who knows?
Maybe it'll help you,

09:39.913 --> 09:41.304
I don't know, figure out
the whole<i> Swan Lake</i> deal.

09:41.323 --> 09:43.397
I'm not sure if you're aware,
but the clock's ticking.

09:43.491 --> 09:45.475
All right, I'll see you at the
super fun dance contest, huh?

09:45.568 --> 09:47.234
Alan! Nobody understands
what we're doing.

09:47.329 --> 09:49.921
Okay, set me up
with the shaman.

09:50.148 --> 09:51.497
Who's got eyes on Frank?

09:51.650 --> 09:54.500
So there I was with a van
full of zombies, all right,

09:54.653 --> 09:57.170
and this dingus is standing
in the middle of the road

09:57.264 --> 09:59.306
talking on his cell phone!

10:00.767 --> 10:02.008
Hey, what do you want,
sweetheart?

10:02.160 --> 10:05.995
Are you the one
they call Frank?

10:06.164 --> 10:08.231
Guys, I'm going 10-1.

10:10.335 --> 10:11.943
What is it that you seek?

10:17.192 --> 10:18.858
Hey, what's going on?

10:19.010 --> 10:21.010
They're having a contest,
I think.

10:21.104 --> 10:23.196
Hey, guys!
(chuckles)

10:23.348 --> 10:25.106
Oh, can I sit here?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.033
Not for any reason, no.

10:27.185 --> 10:28.034
It's nothing personal.

10:28.186 --> 10:30.503
Just everyone
kind of hates you.

10:32.023 --> 10:33.381
Hey, friend.

10:34.876 --> 10:36.509
Got you a coffee.

10:39.197 --> 10:42.866
I figured,
since we are friends,

10:42.884 --> 10:45.626
maybe you could
tell me why you abruptly

10:45.646 --> 10:48.480
changed your mind about us?

10:48.631 --> 10:50.223
You know what, Mike?
I'm just not feeling it.

10:50.375 --> 10:51.590
I don't wanna be mean
about it,

10:51.743 --> 10:54.894
but I think we need to
give each other some room.

Yeah, I'm fine.

Dancers, we've got
a contest for you today

that I'm just now
learning about.

11:17.419 --> 11:19.344
-ALL: Whoo!
-Here's how it's going to go.

11:19.571 --> 11:21.587
You will each dance
your own style

11:21.682 --> 11:24.240
for 30 seconds in front
of a panel of your peers--

11:24.300 --> 11:27.410
more specifically,
the leads of our show.

11:27.429 --> 11:30.096
Justin, Simon, Brittney
will be judging this challenge.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.098
I don't wanna judge these guys.

11:32.250 --> 11:35.176
Really? I've been
judging them for months.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.028
-Now it's official.
-What's the prize?

11:37.255 --> 11:38.345
Yeah, what are we dancing for?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.014
WAYNE: Well, that is
an excellent question.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.032
What is the prize?

11:41.259 --> 11:42.442
A lifetime supply of shrimp.

11:42.536 --> 11:45.352
A lifetime supply of s-shrimp?
Really?

11:45.447 --> 11:48.355
Hell, yeah!
You hos are going down.

11:48.524 --> 11:49.615
Yes, a lifetime supply
of shrimp.

11:49.768 --> 11:50.450
Guys, what could be better?

11:50.544 --> 11:51.543
All right, let's reset please.

11:51.770 --> 11:53.211
-Okay, here we go.
-I don't understand.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.879
Are we supposed to get that
all at once?

11:55.031 --> 11:55.863
NICK: No, you don't get it
all at once.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.156
It's monthly.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.550
Is it wild caught
or farm-raised?

11:58.777 --> 12:00.034
-Is it peeled and de-veined?
-I'm sure that it is, yeah.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.277
What if I have a big family?

12:01.296 --> 12:02.554
Do they get
a lifetime supply too?

12:02.797 --> 12:04.781
I can see you guys have a lot
of questions about the shrimp,

12:04.874 --> 12:05.873
so I'm gonna reach out
to sales,

12:05.967 --> 12:07.283
and then I'll circle back,
all right, guys?

12:07.376 --> 12:10.377
We gotta get this, okay?
Let's see some energy please.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.378
And--oh.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.565
Sorry I'm late.
What's going on?

12:13.792 --> 12:14.958
Where the hell were you?

12:15.218 --> 12:16.901
We're having a contest where,
apparently, the first prize

12:17.128 --> 12:18.962
is a lifetime supply of shrimp,
for some reason.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.888
Oh, that's lovely.

12:20.982 --> 12:22.648
Lovely?
What happened to you?

12:22.817 --> 12:23.983
I took some magic mushrooms.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.577
Did you know that
there's a shaman in transpo?

12:25.804 --> 12:29.305
Well, I guess everyone's
gone crazy, and I'm all alone.

12:29.398 --> 12:30.915
Okay, guys.
Let's do this again, all right?

12:31.142 --> 12:32.417
Can we go back to one, please?

12:32.568 --> 12:35.144
Everybody, I need you to
act excited about the shrimp,

12:35.163 --> 12:38.039
and I would remind you
that the shrimp is delicious.

12:38.149 --> 12:39.315
Delicious, okay?
Here we go.

12:39.408 --> 12:41.092
Come on, guys, energy.
And, Wayne, action.

12:41.319 --> 12:43.987
Dancers, have we got
a challenge for you.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.096
(cheers and applause)

12:45.323 --> 12:46.489
-You will each dance...
-Excuse me.

12:46.508 --> 12:48.157
WAYNE:
Your own style for 30 seconds

12:48.176 --> 12:51.085
in front of a panel
of your peers.

12:51.179 --> 12:52.512
JULIA: Hey, Paula.
Where you going?

12:52.664 --> 12:53.938
I don't need shrimp,

12:54.165 --> 12:56.182
but I do need a drink,
so I'm out of here.

12:56.334 --> 12:58.017
-Love day drinking. I'm in.
-Didn't invite you.

12:58.169 --> 12:59.519
Yeah, well, I'm coming anyway.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.529
Hi.
Julia.

13:09.681 --> 13:10.847
WAYNE: I understand
you're working on

13:10.940 --> 13:13.607
some exciting
and very personal choreography.

13:13.627 --> 13:14.851
Can you tell us about it?

13:14.869 --> 13:16.610
MIKE: It's about a robot

13:16.630 --> 13:21.874
who falls in love
and becomes a human person

13:21.968 --> 13:25.545
who then gets
his heart ripped out.

13:25.697 --> 13:28.865
Then he's gotta go back
to being a robot.

13:28.883 --> 13:30.700
Well, perhaps the robot
should go and talk to Paula.

13:30.793 --> 13:33.870
The robot tried, Wayne.

13:33.888 --> 13:36.981
Perhaps a lifetime supply
of shrimp will buck you up.

13:37.133 --> 13:40.226
I don't think that shrimp's
gonna fix this.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.155
You know, there's just--
there's only one thing I want,

13:44.307 --> 13:47.659
and I can't win it back
with dancing.

13:48.995 --> 13:52.055
Ugh, it's so weird
not competing in this.

13:52.115 --> 13:54.815
We have all this time
on our hands.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.751
Yep.
Lots of time.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.564
I think I saw Starbursts
at crafty.

14:01.657 --> 14:02.899
Hmm.

14:02.917 --> 14:05.510
Well, we should go get some.

14:13.169 --> 14:14.185

We just came in here
because I lost my kaftan.

14:17.599 --> 14:19.023
You know what? It's not here.
Let's go check the locker room.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.767
It will only reveal itself
when it wants to be found,

14:21.920 --> 14:23.510

-I just needed a moment.

14:32.764 --> 14:36.690
It was very loud out there--
all those bodies.

14:36.784 --> 14:38.710
Not that the human body
isn't a marvelous thing.

14:38.861 --> 14:42.046
You know, I always thought
ballet was about unison,

14:42.273 --> 14:43.606
and it is,
but that's only because

14:43.625 --> 14:47.534
unison is what makes
all the differences pop.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.445
I didn't understand that

15:01.568 --> 15:04.961
I have so much to teach you,
and you--

15:05.054 --> 15:07.388
you have so much to teach me.

15:07.482 --> 15:09.799
It flows both ways.
You're my favorite.

15:09.892 --> 15:12.802
Don't tell the others.

I value our relationship too,

15:19.920 --> 15:22.662
But I have to ask.
Are you okay?

15:22.814 --> 15:25.498
I'm brilliant.
Mm-hmm.

a twinsmergency,

15:41.182 --> 15:42.941
Vote for her.
Say some nice things.

15:43.092 --> 15:44.167
A public declaration
of support.

15:44.185 --> 15:45.759

Okay, hey.
Brittney is in the bag for you.

15:58.107 --> 15:59.273
Did you tell Justin
to vote for you?

15:59.292 --> 16:00.516
No.
That's cheating.

16:00.535 --> 16:01.960
I want to win
by beating everybody fairly.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.962
No, you can't rely
on winning this thing fairly.

16:04.113 --> 16:05.354
You said you wanted revenge,
right?

16:05.373 --> 16:06.965
These things are always rigged.

16:07.192 --> 16:08.633
I'm the producer, all right?
Listen to me.

16:08.784 --> 16:11.285
No, and by the way, producer,
a lifetime supply of shrimp?

16:11.346 --> 16:12.545
I mean, come on.
What the hell?

16:12.639 --> 16:14.305
Bubba Gump Shrimp reached out
earlier in the season,

16:14.457 --> 16:15.715
then they got cold feet,
we--eh.

16:15.867 --> 16:16.975
Just tell Justin
to vote for you.

16:17.126 --> 16:18.977
Look in my eyes.
What do you see?

16:19.128 --> 16:20.478

Warmth.

16:20.629 --> 16:22.313
Compassion.
Commitment to social justice.

16:22.465 --> 16:24.707
And three kittens
curled up in a basket.

16:24.726 --> 16:26.726
No, murder.
You see murder in my eyes.

16:26.878 --> 16:28.711
I am not cheating.
I don't have to.

16:28.804 --> 16:30.989
And that's final.

16:31.216 --> 16:33.140
You have to.
You have to cheat to win.

16:33.234 --> 16:36.494
I want it ice cold--
frozen tundra cold--

16:36.721 --> 16:38.145

and a twist.

16:38.164 --> 16:38.904
-You got it?
-Yeah.

16:39.057 --> 16:40.147
I'll have the same thing.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.226
And a menu probably
would be a good idea.

16:43.319 --> 16:45.503
I--I really feel like you
should tell me what's going on.

16:45.730 --> 16:46.579
I really think it's weird

16:46.731 --> 16:48.064
you're asking me
personal questions.

16:48.233 --> 16:49.732
I didn't invite you,
and we barely know each other.

16:49.751 --> 16:52.176
Well, that's mean,
but I have two teenage girls,

16:52.369 --> 16:54.512

16:54.663 --> 16:56.255

16:56.391 --> 17:00.167
and I think that that something
has to do with your health.

17:00.261 --> 17:04.747
I've been through this with--
with people before.

17:04.840 --> 17:06.098
Drinking in the morning,

17:06.251 --> 17:07.250
pushing people away--
you know, really, honestly,
