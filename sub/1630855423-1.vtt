02:36.906 --> 02:40.160
<i>All you need is salt and pepper
because a great piece of meat</i>

02:40.160 --> 02:43.830
<i>like this should taste of meat
and really not a whole lot else.</i>

02:43.830 --> 02:45.290
<i>So, I thought we would make some--</i>

02:45.290 --> 02:47.208
Why do you like cooking shows?

02:47.208 --> 02:49.044
- No idea.
- Do you cook?

02:49.544 --> 02:50.670
Nope.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.715
<i>We start with a russet potato.</i>

02:53.715 --> 02:55.633
Just watch the shows.

02:56.468 --> 02:57.510
Yep.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.263
What about you? Do you cook?

03:01.723 --> 03:05.602
I always think I'm going to,
but I never really do, no.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.480
A little piece of salmon here and there.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.731
You know, that's about it.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.441
Well, salmon's something.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.818
It is. Thank you for that.

03:15.653 --> 03:16.613
Salmon hard to cook?

03:16.613 --> 03:19.115
- Brutal.
- Yeah. Looks it.

03:20.533 --> 03:24.496
Many years ago,
I thought I would start poaching eggs.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.998
I liked the idea

03:26.998 --> 03:30.335
of eating them in the morning
on little toast points.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.504
Like royalty, you know, but

03:33.421 --> 03:34.714
yeah.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.217
- Didn't follow through.
- Why?

03:37.842 --> 03:39.636
You know, I was 30,

03:39.636 --> 03:43.890
too busy to slow my roll
for a three-minute egg.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.644
Well, I support that poached egg dream.

03:47.644 --> 03:51.439
It's not too late.
I mean, you got the three minutes.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.024
I do.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.860
Come on, baby.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.782
And here we go.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.663
Good morning!

04:06.663 --> 04:08.456
Did you get the caviar I sent you?

04:08.456 --> 04:11.584
God, I get so much caviar sent to me,

04:11.584 --> 04:13.044
I don't know which is yours.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.421
The expensive one.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.590
Oh, then I got it. Totally unnecessary.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.175
Oh, I disagree, babe.

04:19.175 --> 04:22.846
It is not every day
someone makes you their plus-one

04:22.846 --> 04:24.305
to the Met Ball.

04:24.305 --> 04:27.392
I mean, all those years,
I've resented those

04:27.392 --> 04:30.603
chic bitches just posing on those stairs.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.356
And now, I'm gonna be one of them.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.317
Seema, those stairs
are only for celebrities.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.820
Real people like us
have a different entrance.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.114
I don't care if I have to squeeze in
through a doggie door,

04:41.114 --> 04:43.825
it's the Met Ball and I'm going!

04:43.825 --> 04:45.243
But who am I wearing?

04:45.243 --> 04:47.412
<i>You're wearing that young, new designer,</i>

04:47.412 --> 04:51.791
LTW's in custom Valentino,
so I'm sure Charlotte will "bring it."

04:52.959 --> 04:54.252
Can you hold on a second?

04:54.252 --> 04:56.963
I'd call Tom Ford,
but I sold his apartment last year

04:56.963 --> 04:58.798
and did not get his asking.

04:59.174 --> 05:02.302
- Hello?
-<i>It's Charlotte.</i>

05:02.302 --> 05:05.930
Oh! Hi. Come on up.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.599
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

05:07.599 --> 05:08.933
<i>I'm just so excited.</i>

05:08.933 --> 05:11.144
- Buh-bye.
- Okay, I'm outta here.

05:11.853 --> 05:12.896
Don't you want an egg?

05:13.480 --> 05:16.691
- No time.
- Right, 'cause I ruined the first two.

05:16.691 --> 05:17.817
Hang in there.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.446
That's, that's my friend, Charlotte.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.282
I don't know why she's here.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.577
- You wanna open the door and find out?
- Oh, right.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.792
Hi! Is it too early?

05:33.792 --> 05:36.670
I just got my sketch
on my Met Ball dress.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.049
Charlotte Goldenblatt,

05:41.049 --> 05:43.843
this is Franklyn Silvias,
he's just leaving.

05:43.843 --> 05:47.389
Franklyn, this is Charlotte.
She's just arriving.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.724
And I'm Carrie Bradshaw.
I'll be your host and emcee

05:49.724 --> 05:52.310
for about the next 30 seconds.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.606
- And who's this?
- This is Richard Burton.

05:56.606 --> 06:00.485
I had to carry him up the stairs
because bulldogs have weak hind legs.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.863
But great faces.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.991
- I'll see you Thursday at work.
- Yeah, Thursday.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.077
- All right, bye.
- Okay. Bye.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.164
Who?

06:13.164 --> 06:14.958
He's my podcast producer.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.876
- What?
- Do you wanna put Mr. Burton down?

06:16.876 --> 06:18.753
- Who?
- Your dog.

06:18.753 --> 06:22.090
Here, have a seat.
I'm making poached eggs with caviar.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.093
- What?
- Yep. I've repurposed my kitchen.

06:25.093 --> 06:29.472
Did you know that stoves
aren't just for storage?

06:29.472 --> 06:32.809
Oh, my God. Look at that!

06:35.228 --> 06:38.690
I just saw the final cut,
but let's start the montage

06:38.690 --> 06:43.069
with the judicial OG
Constance Baker Motley. Yeah.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.405
Mama, listen to me recite my French poem.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.198
I gotta go, Alice. Poetry emergency.

06:47.198 --> 06:51.077
I'll send the file with my Act One edits
before I leave. Okay, bye.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.620
<i>Fais-le.</i>

06:52.620 --> 06:56.249
<i>La Cigale et la Fourmi
par Jean de La fontaine.</i>

06:56.249 --> 06:58.209
- Ma!
<i>- La Cigale ayant chante--</i>

06:58.209 --> 06:59.753
Hey, Ma, where's my lacrosse stick?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.254
Hall closet on the left side.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.089
- Did you brush your teeth?
- Yeah.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.174
Breath?

07:04.174 --> 07:05.383
Good.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.094
<i>Tout l'ete elle se trouva bien depourvue--</i>

07:08.094 --> 07:11.097
Mom, you never signed my permission slip
for the robotics competition.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.432
I sent it in yesterday.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.725
- Did you brush your teeth?
- Yeah.

07:13.725 --> 07:14.726
Breath?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.645
- Good.
<i>- Quand la bise fut venue--</i>

07:17.645 --> 07:19.105
- Honey?
- Yes?

07:19.105 --> 07:21.191
Did my Morehouse tie
make it home from the cleaners?

07:21.191 --> 07:22.567
I don't know. Why don't you ask

07:22.567 --> 07:23.818
the other 50 ties in your closet?

07:24.652 --> 07:25.653
Sarcasm for breakfast.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.322
Well, it's lunchtime for me.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.157
I've been up since four
working on my edit.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.242
I know you have

07:32.118 --> 07:33.703
but I missed you this morning.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.540
I missed you yesterday morning.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.669
- Did you miss me?
- So much.

07:40.669 --> 07:45.674
But right now, I have to send this email,
get the children to school, head downtown,

07:45.674 --> 07:47.842
and dazzle the Walker Foundation

07:47.842 --> 07:50.303
to get this other 25 grand
to finish my doc.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.765
Oh, but other than that,
it is all about missing you.

07:53.765 --> 07:57.102
Okay? And your missing tie.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.853
Okay. You're working too hard.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.648
Why don't you cancel this meeting
and let me write you a check?

08:04.859 --> 08:06.569
Well, that is a very generous offer,

08:06.569 --> 08:10.073
but considering I am a grown woman
with an MFA in film

08:10.073 --> 08:12.742
and two docs under my belt,

08:12.742 --> 08:17.872
I think I can rely on myself to secure
the financing.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.251
- Loud and clear.
- And later this evening,

08:21.251 --> 08:24.379
it will be louder and clearer.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.297
Let's go, Gabrielle.

08:26.297 --> 08:30.010
<i>Au revoir,</i> big, swinging checkbook.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.639
Okay, go ahead.

08:34.639 --> 08:38.727
We kissed in the elevator
three weeks ago at work

08:38.727 --> 08:40.395
and wound up back at my place.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.148
I am so, so happy for you, Carrie.

08:43.148 --> 08:46.234
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't tell anyone.

08:46.234 --> 08:49.279
And don't do the Charlotte thing.
Don't make us into a happy couple.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.573
It's sex, a cooking show,

08:51.573 --> 08:55.160
a sleepover every Thursday,
and it's great. The end.

08:55.160 --> 08:58.121
Okay. How big is his dick?

08:58.121 --> 09:00.331
I'm not allowed to be me,
so I'm gonna be Samantha.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.208
Okay, wait. Now I'm gonna be Miranda.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.210
- Okay.
- If you sleep with someone at work,

09:04.210 --> 09:06.504
you are giving away your power.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.132
I miss Charlotte.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.384
If you see her,
will you tell her that I miss her?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.928
Yes. I'm just surprised.

09:13.928 --> 09:17.223
I mean, it's just kind of unexpected.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.184
Well, you know what?

09:19.184 --> 09:22.645
Life's too short not to try something new.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.148
Like poaching an egg.

09:31.988 --> 09:35.116
Hey! How's it goin'?

09:35.116 --> 09:36.868
<i>Best getaway ever.</i>

09:36.868 --> 09:40.747
The sun, the sex, the toasted chili salsa.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.957
- I feel so alive.
-<i>Really?</i>

09:42.957 --> 09:44.626
'Cause it looks like
you're just standin' around

09:44.626 --> 09:46.753
in your underwear in a weird-ass room.

09:46.753 --> 09:50.173
Best standing in my underwear
in a weird-ass room ever!

09:50.173 --> 09:53.677
Che got stuck in a costume fitting
for their TV pilot,

09:53.677 --> 09:57.972
so I'm taking their
sensory deprivation tank appointment.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.307
That doesn't sound like you.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.769
It's the new me. Best me ever!

10:02.769 --> 10:06.481
<i>Well, I'm still the old me,
sitting on my couch at night</i>

10:06.481 --> 10:08.983
watching "Bridgerton" knockoffs,
waiting for a FaceTime

10:08.983 --> 10:10.860
from my estranged husband on tour.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.238
<i>Well, that's gotta stop now.</i>

10:13.238 --> 10:14.656
<i>Get out of the house.</i>

10:14.656 --> 10:17.951
<i>- Take yourself to dinner.</i>
- I tried that, Miranda.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.036
It's exhausting
explaining to curious waiters

10:20.036 --> 10:23.832
why their favorite married couple
isn't splitting their usual <i>cacio e pepe.</i>

10:23.832 --> 10:26.835
<i>Then go somewhere where
they don't know you and Andre Rashad.</i>

10:26.835 --> 10:30.255
Will the B Train take me to 1996?
'Cause we've been together forever.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.049
All right,
I'm done supporting this pity party

10:33.049 --> 10:36.136
for a brilliant,
tenured Ivy League professor.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.889
If I can float in the dark
in a saline solution,

10:39.889 --> 10:41.891
you can take yourself out to dinner alone.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.186
<i>Well, I gotta do somethin'.
I took this online yoga class this morning</i>

10:45.186 --> 10:47.772
and this yoga instructor told us
to open up and let it flow,

10:47.772 --> 10:49.941
and I yelled out,
"Fuck you, Andre Rashad!"

10:50.734 --> 10:52.402
<i>I thought I was muted. I wasn't.</i>

10:52.402 --> 10:55.488
I'm no longer welcome
at Brown Yogis United.

10:55.864 --> 11:02.787
And for the stand-up section,
let's drive this around the block.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.459
- Okay.
- There we go.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.795
Left arm.

11:11.755 --> 11:12.797
What do you think?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.842
Hey, America! I'm non-binary!

11:17.052 --> 11:17.927
Got it.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.220
Thanks.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.348
I appreciate that.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.809
I kinda like the idea
of pulling it all back.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.604
Maybe just, I don't know,
jeans and a t-shirt.

11:27.604 --> 11:31.816
Jeans aren't very forgiving up top,
and you, you need a jacket.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.778
It doesn't have to be this one.

11:34.778 --> 11:38.656
But look at how major it is
with the blue stripe in the hair.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.658
Why does my hair look like that?

11:40.658 --> 11:42.869
Hey, where's my star?

11:42.869 --> 11:44.371
They don't like the hair.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.207
Really? ABC loves the look.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.335
Well, it looks hot on you, BD,

11:50.335 --> 11:56.883
but, I mean, I don't have a blue stripe,
and the character's name is Che,

11:56.883 --> 11:59.427
the show's called "Che Pasa," right?

11:59.427 --> 12:01.763
- It's me.
- No, of course, it is.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.431
It's just 'cause, you know,
I'm the writer,

12:03.431 --> 12:04.974
so I thought it'd be,
like, a fun little bridge

12:04.974 --> 12:07.185
between you and me.

12:07.185 --> 12:11.147
With all due respect, BD,
it's a bridge too far.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.608
They want to just wear a t-shirt.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.694
So, no jacket?

12:24.369 --> 12:25.662
My eye.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.719
Where's that light?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.816
Fuck the new me! Jesus.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.571
- Want some?
- Is there a flavor?

12:59.571 --> 13:01.364
- Lollipop.
- Lollipop.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.074
- Ooh, I'll get that.
- No, no, no.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.285
Carrie Bradshaw, it's on me.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.621
And it's not even a fake reach
like all the other times.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.166
- Are you sure?
- Just don't make fun of my credit card.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.625
It's blue.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.086
It's the least I can do.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.714
I mean, you're letting my wife
design your fancy-ass dress.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.132
- Okay--
- It's a big break for Smoke.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.134
No, no, no. This is not a favor, okay?

13:21.134 --> 13:24.637
No wife of yours,
no matter how much I love you,

13:24.637 --> 13:27.140
would ever be designing my dress

13:27.140 --> 13:31.770
if I didn't think she was
a crazy massive talent

13:31.770 --> 13:33.313
who I want to wear first.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.106
Oh, you're gonna make me cry.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.861
Smurf National Bank.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.074
Hey, so, can you score two more tickets
for Smoke and me?

13:44.407 --> 13:46.785
Jackie, this isn't a Phish concert, okay?

13:46.785 --> 13:49.829
- It's the Met Ball.
- Come on. We're cool.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.457
I mean, she's Black, and I do a podcast
from my living room.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.835
To be clear, Herbert saying,
"You work too hard.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.253
Let me write you a check,"

13:57.253 --> 13:59.631
translates to,
"Be there for my morning cuddle

13:59.631 --> 14:01.257
and help me find my favorite tie."

14:01.257 --> 14:03.677
Oh, I know. Harry's all like,

14:03.677 --> 14:06.304
"Get out there, babe!
You do everything,"

14:06.304 --> 14:09.307
until one morning,
he doesn't have his everything bagel.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.851
And then it's like,
"This house is falling apart!"

14:11.851 --> 14:15.939
Hey, I'm really enjoying listening to
your podcast "Rich People's Problems!"

14:15.939 --> 14:17.982
You know, you're lucky
I'm loaded with pins and can't move

14:17.982 --> 14:19.442
'cause you don't want me
to come over there.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.403
Lisa, where's your hot designer,
Pierre Paolo?

14:21.403 --> 14:22.779
I want a selfie with him.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.072
Anthony.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.281
- What?
- Is everything all right?

14:25.281 --> 14:27.409
You are my date at Lisa's table.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.911
You are not gonna embarrass me
by asking for selfies

14:29.911 --> 14:31.413
with celebrities at the Met.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.039
Like I was the one
that chased Justin Bieber

14:33.039 --> 14:35.417
- down that hallway.
- It was for the kids!

14:35.417 --> 14:38.920
Okay. My nanny has the stomach flu
and can't pick up Gabrielle.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.880
- Oh no!
- Ina, I am so sorry.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.924
I promise I won't mess up
any of your hard work.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.968
Just tell him he can make the train
as long as he wants.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.136
Bye.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.096
Hi, Gabby, it's Mommy.
I'm on my way!

14:48.680 --> 14:49.973
- Love the boobage.
- Oh, thank you.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.017
- Wait till you see the rest.
- Mm. Mm.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.935
- What are you gonna wear?
- A tux.

14:53.935 --> 14:57.230
Just a tux? The theme is "Veiled Beauty."

14:57.230 --> 14:58.481
Well, I'm a veiled threat.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.275
Just ask anyone.

15:00.275 --> 15:03.028
I'm so excited. The Met Ball.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.362
God, I love balls.

15:15.623 --> 15:19.002
Okay. Dinner is gonna be
a little bit late tonight

15:19.002 --> 15:20.879
because after my fitting,

15:20.879 --> 15:23.048
I had to go
with your Uncle Anthony to get his tux.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.966
Mom, you've got a big problem.

15:24.966 --> 15:28.011
Like, giant. Enormous. So big.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.013
Rock, stop scaring me. What is it?

15:30.013 --> 15:31.639
Okay.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.808
Dad thinks he's going with you to the Met.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.603
What? Why would he think that?

15:36.603 --> 15:39.189
No. Your daddy hates these kinda things.

15:39.189 --> 15:42.317
Well, he just came home
all excited about his outfit.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.277
What outfit?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.571
Cheerio, old chaps!

15:47.822 --> 15:49.240
Honey, where'd you get that hat?

15:49.240 --> 15:51.242
It matches yours, right? Am I right?

15:51.242 --> 15:52.619
After I saw your outfit,

15:52.619 --> 15:55.246
I went to this guy on Madison Avenue,
and he is hookin' me up.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.165
I mean, it's the Met Ball,

15:57.165 --> 15:58.750
I can't just wear a plain, old tux.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.419
I'm just surprised.
You're so excited.

16:01.419 --> 16:04.297
I never went to my prom, you know,
'cause I had Epstein-Barr that whole year.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.384
- Right, right.
- I'm really lookin' forward to it!

16:07.384 --> 16:12.055
- You, me, Rihanna.
- Oh, you, me, and Rihanna.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.139
Yeah!

16:15.350 --> 16:19.062
- Next voicemail, Franklyn, please.
- Comin' at ya.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.731
This is Chase.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.191
<i>Hi, Carrie.</i>

16:23.191 --> 16:26.277
<i>I'm seeing this guy
and we're having great sex,</i>

16:26.277 --> 16:27.737
<i>but it's casual so far.</i>

16:28.279 --> 16:29.906
<i>How do I know if he'd be open</i>

16:29.906 --> 16:32.742
<i>to taking it to more
of a relationship place?</i>

16:32.742 --> 16:33.868
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

16:33.868 --> 16:37.205
First of all, Relationship Place
is a great name for a restaurant.

16:37.205 --> 16:41.084
Okay.
I think and certainly, I'm no expert,

16:41.084 --> 16:45.922
but if he'd like to go there,
there will be a moment

16:46.339 --> 16:49.718
when he sort of steps out of the pattern
you are currently both in

16:49.718 --> 16:52.095
and signals to you

16:52.095 --> 16:56.558
that he thinks this relationship is
more than just sex.

16:56.558 --> 17:00.478
Anyway, that's what I think.
I hope that's helpful, listeners.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.064
'Kay, who's next?

17:03.064 --> 17:04.149
Hey.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.821
- Great show.
- Yeah. Back at ya.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.823
Oh, and, a buddy of mine is

17:11.823 --> 17:14.117
christening his new bourbon line
at a rooftop party

17:14.117 --> 17:15.952
with some friends Tuesday night.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.038
Might be fun. How 'bout it?

17:18.788 --> 17:21.583
Oh, sure.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.834
Cool.

17:28.715 --> 17:34.012
I mean, is this a strap-on or a cat toy?

17:34.012 --> 17:35.263
Can we move this along?

17:35.263 --> 17:37.057
I've got a set
at The Comedy Store at nine.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.683
This is a lot of work for something

17:38.683 --> 17:42.354
that I don't even know if
I'm philosophically or spiritually into.

17:42.354 --> 17:45.023
Please, you scream, "Gimme a dick."

17:46.358 --> 17:47.984
Didn't they have a beginner model?

17:47.984 --> 17:49.486
I'm not a beginner.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.993
Okay. You've got at least 10 more minutes
of heavy lifting.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.287
I'm gonna take this. It's Carrie.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.414
Backstage Cirque du Soleil,
this is Che.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.124
<i>Say hi for me!</i>

18:03.124 --> 18:04.501
Miranda says hi.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.128
Tell her I said hi. What's she up to?

18:07.128 --> 18:08.838
Oh, trying to figure out a strap-on.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.465
I withdraw the question.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.259
So, hey, how are you?

18:13.593 --> 18:15.345
Curious. What's Franklyn like?

18:15.345 --> 18:16.554
<i>My Franklyn?</i>

18:16.554 --> 18:19.933
He's a chill dude.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.477
-<i>How chill?</i>
- Why?

18:24.896 --> 18:30.902
I'm about to take your and my relationship
to a very personal place.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.779
I just told you
Miranda's strappin' on a dick.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.197
We're there.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.323
Put her on speaker.

18:35.323 --> 18:37.158
Oh, she wants me to put you on speaker.

18:37.158 --> 18:40.161
- Put her on speaker.
- Okay, all right.

18:41.246 --> 18:43.665
Okay, I'm sleeping with Franklyn.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.251
- Who's Franklyn?
- Her podcast producer.

18:46.251 --> 18:49.796
Carrie, if you sleep with someone at work,
you lose your power.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.381
Take her off speaker.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.050
You're out. Get back to it.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.885
All right, all right.

18:57.095 --> 19:00.348
So, you and Franklyn. I saw that coming.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.184
I didn't. Out of nowhere,
we kissed in the elevator,

19:03.184 --> 19:05.812
and now we have sex every Thursday
after the podcast.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.189
- Nice!
-<i>No, it was until today.</i>

19:08.189 --> 19:11.276
He invited me to a roof party
with his friends

19:11.276 --> 19:12.944
and I said yes.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.196
And that's a bad thing?

19:15.196 --> 19:16.740
I don't wanna take this to the roof.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.034
In fact, I don't wanna take this
to any other level.

19:19.034 --> 19:22.370
<i>I like this level.</i>

19:22.370 --> 19:24.414
Thursday sex after the podcast.

19:24.414 --> 19:27.500
Right, so why did you
say yes to his invite?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.336
I'm pathologically polite.

19:29.336 --> 19:33.423
Okay, but some relationships
are just about sex.

19:33.423 --> 19:36.468
And that's the primary dynamic,
which is awesome,

19:36.468 --> 19:39.012
but then you have
to keep it in the bedroom and--

19:39.012 --> 19:40.680
And not the roof, right.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.475
So, back to the original question,

19:43.475 --> 19:45.560
<i>Franklyn, what's he like?
Is he really chill</i>

19:45.560 --> 19:48.146
<i>or is he gonna get, like, you know,</i>

19:48.146 --> 19:50.982
all emotional when I tell him
I only want Thursdays with him?

19:50.982 --> 19:55.695
Carrie, truthfully, under all that chill,
he's a dude.

19:55.695 --> 19:59.199
So, I have no idea what's up
in that man head.

19:59.199 --> 20:02.243
All right. Thank you, then.
Good night.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.203
<i>Good night.</i>

20:05.663 --> 20:07.082
Okay.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.670
Hey! What happened to penis-palooza?

20:11.670 --> 20:13.088
Nah. Show's over.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.756
I'm on Open Table.

20:14.756 --> 20:19.594
How about we get outta here,
grab some dinner, and I come see your set?

20:21.054 --> 20:23.598
I'm still workin' out my new material.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.184
Well, maybe, maybe tomorrow night?

20:26.184 --> 20:29.104
- Definitely tomorrow night.
- See?

20:29.688 --> 20:30.939
Dick implied.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.945
Good morning.

20:36.945 --> 20:39.948
My son will be in town
for one day next week.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.033
I want you to meet him.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.451
Really?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.329
I'd like that.

20:50.709 --> 20:51.918
So, lunch Monday.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.215
This Monday?

20:57.215 --> 20:59.342
Does it really come down to this?

20:59.342 --> 21:01.886
The man or the Met?

21:01.886 --> 21:03.888
Is the universe really that cruel?

21:03.888 --> 21:05.932
Yes. The universe is a bitch.

21:08.393 --> 21:10.395
Thank you. My purse was exhausted.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.480
- There you are.
- Well, you know,

21:12.480 --> 21:14.983
you said you wanted your relationship
to move forward, right?

21:14.983 --> 21:17.569
Yes, but this is like
a sudden lurch forward.

21:17.569 --> 21:20.196
I've never even been to his place.
My choice.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.657
But meeting his son
will definitely get you closer.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.492
I'd be meeting his son and his ex-wife.

21:24.492 --> 21:28.538
She's invited, too, so I'll get to see
how close we'll stay after our divorce.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.999
- So, you can't do both?
- It's a European lunch.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.585
It could take a month.
I mean, if I go to the Met,

21:33.585 --> 21:37.672
I'd have to be home with my glam squad
by 2:30.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.799
2:30? I need a month.

21:39.799 --> 21:43.386
- You need two minutes.
- Fuck, I can't come.

21:43.386 --> 21:45.180
There's just too much on the table.

21:45.180 --> 21:47.474
I'm sorry, Carrie.
Now, you won't have someone gorgeous

21:47.474 --> 21:48.767
to go to the Met Ball with.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.895
What about that gorgeous
booty call guy Charlotte told me about?

21:51.895 --> 21:53.813
I never said booty call.

21:53.813 --> 21:57.192
- You have a booty call?
- It's not a booty call. We work together.

21:57.192 --> 21:58.985
So, it's an actionable booty call?

21:59.861 --> 22:02.947
She isn't ready to let someone in
in a significant way.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.325
Where'd you get that from?

22:06.659 --> 22:09.079
That's your response? Your--

22:09.079 --> 22:11.331
Okay. I-- Sorry.
What is happening with you?

22:12.582 --> 22:18.588
I am having "exit out of grief sex"
every Thursday with a very nice man.

22:18.588 --> 22:19.798
He is nice, yes.

22:19.798 --> 22:22.842
Then, he asked me to go out
with his friends

22:22.842 --> 22:26.930
on a Tuesday,
and I felt like I had to say yes.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.933
- Just don't go.
- Oh, okay. How?

22:29.933 --> 22:32.185
How do I tell him I don't wanna go
out on Tuesday

22:32.185 --> 22:34.479
without seeming like
a "See ya next Tuesday"?

22:34.479 --> 22:36.606
You're overthinking this.
Men aren't that emotional.

22:36.606 --> 22:38.608
Just tell him you changed your mind.
He'll handle it.

22:38.608 --> 22:41.444
- Okay.
- Last week, I was down on my knees

22:41.444 --> 22:44.114
blowin' this cute nurse practitioner,

22:44.114 --> 22:46.032
and I feel a tap, tap, tap on my head.

22:46.032 --> 22:49.035
I look up and he says he thought
he was gonna be into it,

22:49.035 --> 22:51.329
- but he changed his mind.
- Oh, my God.

22:51.329 --> 22:53.998
- What did you do next?
- No "oh, my God," no "drama."

22:53.998 --> 22:56.209
I took it like a man.
I got up, got dressed,

22:56.209 --> 22:58.586
went home, ate a box of Fiddle Faddle
and I'm fine.

23:00.005 --> 23:02.382
Well, tap, tap, tap.

23:02.382 --> 23:03.675
What does that mean?

23:03.675 --> 23:07.929
It means that due to circumstances
beyond my control,

23:07.929 --> 23:11.016
I have to take Harry to the Met Ball
instead of you.

23:11.016 --> 23:13.143
- What?
- He already bought a top hat,

23:13.143 --> 23:16.479
and he never got to go to his prom
because he had Epstein-Barr.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.940
So? I had Lyme disease for five months.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.483
Did I throw you from a speeding car?

23:20.483 --> 23:22.068
- No!
- But we're married.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.529
I can't take my best gay friend
over my husband.

23:24.529 --> 23:26.740
Oh, okay. I didn't know you were
on the Supreme Court.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.242
All right, simmer down, simmer down.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.327
You can be my plus-one.

23:31.327 --> 23:34.748
See? Yes! Yes! You can go with Carrie.

23:34.748 --> 23:36.207
Well

23:36.875 --> 23:39.669
- I'll consider it.
- Oh, thank you.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.846
Bartender, I'll have what she's reading.

23:50.889 --> 23:52.557
Such focus.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.267
Must be absorbing.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.935
Well, Skip Gates always is,

23:55.935 --> 23:58.229
but since I'm on my second
glass of Malbec,

23:58.229 --> 24:00.565
I'm having a hard time concentrating.

24:00.565 --> 24:02.609
Well, you're finding your roots over
a glass of wine.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.402
That's a challenge.

24:06.029 --> 24:08.490
- How was your dinner?
- It was wonderful.

24:09.366 --> 24:11.951
I'd love to join you for dessert, but...

24:12.786 --> 24:13.661
But?

24:14.287 --> 24:16.498
You're using your purse as a rampart.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.417
Oh, okay.

24:19.417 --> 24:20.543
It's alright.

24:20.543 --> 24:22.671
- I think there's a hook here somewhere.
- I'll put it right here.

24:22.671 --> 24:23.838
There you go.

24:25.548 --> 24:28.093
- I'm Toussaint.
- Yes, you are.

24:30.011 --> 24:31.846
- I'm Nya.
- Nya.

24:32.889 --> 24:34.307
Beautiful name.

24:35.183 --> 24:37.602
Have you tried
the molten chocolate cake here?

24:37.602 --> 24:40.313
It will make you see the face of God.

24:41.356 --> 24:45.235
I believe it will.
And I do love chocolate, but

24:47.237 --> 24:48.905
I'm on kind of a diet.

24:49.823 --> 24:53.118
I didn't know you had to give up chocolate
once you got married.

24:53.118 --> 24:54.828
- You do.
- Really?

24:54.828 --> 24:56.579
No wonder I'm still single.

24:58.748 --> 25:00.875
I was too busy looking in these
deep brown eyes.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.878
I didn't clock the ring.
My apologies.

25:03.878 --> 25:08.299
I will make sure your fortress is secure.

25:08.883 --> 25:10.301
Nice to meet you, Nya.

25:18.768 --> 25:20.437
You good, ma'am?

25:20.437 --> 25:22.022
I'll have another Malbec.

25:22.731 --> 25:24.816
Ah, man.

25:25.358 --> 25:30.321
I am so lazy in LA.
No one walks anywhere.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.699
You know?
It's like yesterday I took an Uber

25:32.699 --> 25:35.243
from my bathroom to my bedroom.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.704
Yeah. And it was way too expensive.

25:40.415 --> 25:42.417
And that is my time.

25:42.417 --> 25:45.670
Thank you so much, everybody.
You've been so great. Thank you.

25:48.131 --> 25:49.799
- Hey, my man!
- Heeey!

25:50.550 --> 25:54.471
Che Diaz, everybody! Che Diaz! Yeah!

25:55.013 --> 25:57.932
Out here in LA filming their TV pilot.

25:57.932 --> 26:01.478
Hey, Che, any part for a white guy?

26:07.734 --> 26:10.320
You were so good!

26:10.987 --> 26:13.490
Nope. Don't hug me.

26:13.490 --> 26:14.657
What's wrong?

26:15.408 --> 26:17.035
I just-- You surprised me.

26:18.661 --> 26:20.121
I'm at work.

26:23.124 --> 26:24.751
You were so good.

26:43.687 --> 26:44.562
<i>Hey.</i>

26:44.562 --> 26:46.648
Hey, Andre. Turn on your FaceTime.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.858
<i>We're talkin' now.
We don't need to FaceTime, babe.</i>

26:48.858 --> 26:51.569
No. No, we do.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.864
I wanna FaceTime with you
'cause I wanna show you something

26:54.864 --> 26:57.033
that's not my face.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.287
Turn it on! Turn it on now.

27:02.872 --> 27:05.083
<i>What's up? Isn't it late there?</i>

27:05.542 --> 27:09.004
I miss you, baby.
Know what else misses you?

27:09.004 --> 27:11.131
Not my face.

27:13.299 --> 27:16.219
I'm wearin' those panties you like.
You know, the ones with the clit beads?

27:16.219 --> 27:17.846
<i>Babe, no, don't put the phone down there.</i>

27:17.846 --> 27:19.347
- I'ma put it down there, baby.
<i>- Nya, stop!</i>

27:19.347 --> 27:20.724
<i>Stop. I'm not alone.</i>

27:21.266 --> 27:22.851
What you mean you're not alone?

27:23.852 --> 27:26.813
Who's there with you?
Show me who's there.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.485
Who the hell is that in a hat?

27:32.485 --> 27:34.362
<i>It's not like that, Nye.</i>

27:34.362 --> 27:37.615
<i>That's Heidi, a backup singer.</i>

27:37.615 --> 27:38.950
<i>I'm helpin' her write songs.</i>

27:38.950 --> 27:42.662
Oh, you're helping Heidi-in-a-hat
write songs in your hotel room?

27:42.662 --> 27:47.375
<i>We're just writing songs,
and it's 9:30 here.</i>

27:47.375 --> 27:48.626
<i>We're fully dressed.</i>

27:48.626 --> 27:53.548
I wish I had known that we were allowed
to write songs with other people

27:53.548 --> 27:55.759
because tonight

27:55.759 --> 28:00.513
I had the chance to write a song
with a super fine man.

28:00.513 --> 28:03.183
<i>- It's not like that.</i>
- Feels like it is!

28:03.183 --> 28:06.644
And if right now was
a song I was writing

28:06.644 --> 28:08.521
it would be a breakup song.

28:08.521 --> 28:14.069
So, goodbye, Andre Rashad
and Little Miss Hipster Heidi.

28:22.369 --> 28:24.371
Fuck around and find out.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.249
Coming!

28:29.334 --> 28:30.502
Hello!

28:30.502 --> 28:32.128
Here we are!

28:32.128 --> 28:34.964
- That is a stunning kimono!
- Thank you.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.634
My friend Stanford
sent it to me from Japan.

28:37.634 --> 28:39.719
Come in, come in!

28:42.055 --> 28:44.474
- I--
- This is very exciting.

28:45.058 --> 28:47.143
I'm not worried. We can do this.

28:47.143 --> 28:49.938
Not worried about what?
What can we do?

28:49.938 --> 28:52.482
So, my seamstress has a stomach flu.

28:52.482 --> 28:54.401
- Oh no.
- So I had to use a new seamstress

28:54.401 --> 28:56.945
and she also got the stomach flu.

28:57.654 --> 28:59.989
There's a seamstress stomach flu?

28:59.989 --> 29:02.450
- It is all over the city.
- The seamstresses have the flu,

29:02.450 --> 29:04.536
but I got lattes, y'all.

29:04.536 --> 29:06.329
But the cape is totally done.

29:06.329 --> 29:09.249
- Totally.
- So it's only the dress.

29:10.125 --> 29:12.627
Okay, so what still needs
to be done on the dress?

29:12.627 --> 29:14.337
All the final fit work.

29:15.630 --> 29:16.756
Oh, my God.

29:21.052 --> 29:23.263
- Dude, that's too small.
- I know that, bitch.

29:25.515 --> 29:26.474
Now what?

29:27.851 --> 29:29.728
That new seamstress
totally fucked this up.

29:29.728 --> 29:33.106
- Fucked it up.
- But we have six hours.

29:33.106 --> 29:35.400
I can open up the back.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.694
- Yeah, take it off.
- Yeah, open it.

29:38.695 --> 29:39.654
How?

29:53.668 --> 29:54.711
Oh, my God.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.548
Hey, can you check again?

30:00.008 --> 30:03.428
Jackie, just sit the fuck back down!
I told you not to come out here again!

30:03.428 --> 30:06.056
Makes me nervous. Seriously?

30:06.431 --> 30:07.891
My bad.

30:10.477 --> 30:12.103
Weird.

30:12.103 --> 30:14.147
I smell Franklyn from the old podcast.

30:14.147 --> 30:17.650
That expensive man perfume
he wears sometimes.

30:17.650 --> 30:20.195
Yeah, he left his jacket here.

30:21.404 --> 30:24.616
But why would Franklyn's jacket
be in your bedroom?

30:25.075 --> 30:26.451
Bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.

30:26.451 --> 30:27.827
Are you and Franklyn dating?

30:27.827 --> 30:28.995
Is he your date to this thing?

30:28.995 --> 30:30.538
That is so adorbs.

30:30.538 --> 30:31.998
Said with no irony at all.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.209
It's not adorbs. We're not dating.

30:34.209 --> 30:36.336
We just hook up after the podcast.

30:36.336 --> 30:37.879
So, you're not taking him to this?

30:37.879 --> 30:39.589
No, it's not like that.

30:39.589 --> 30:42.300
We're not a couple.

30:43.885 --> 30:46.554
Does he know that?
'Cause men are dumb.

30:46.554 --> 30:48.014
It's just sex.

30:48.014 --> 30:51.685
Carrie Bradshaw, the world has changed
since you've been out there, okay?

30:51.685 --> 30:54.562
It's not alright to objectify
people anymore.

30:54.562 --> 30:56.189
Men have feelings, too.

30:56.690 --> 30:58.316
So, to sum it up

30:58.942 --> 31:01.152
men are dumb with feelings.

31:01.152 --> 31:03.363
- Exactly.
- Gotcha.

31:03.363 --> 31:04.447
Yeah.

31:08.034 --> 31:11.621
- How's it going?
- I still have four hours. Yeah.

31:11.621 --> 31:12.580
Yeah.

31:20.547 --> 31:21.631
The Colosseum.

31:22.424 --> 31:24.467
Brady and Louisa look so cute.

31:32.475 --> 31:34.686
I'm kind of learning my lines.

31:35.437 --> 31:36.646
You're acting like a--

31:43.153 --> 31:45.196
Something is different.

31:45.196 --> 31:47.907
You don't want me to hold you lately.

31:49.743 --> 31:51.619
Is there something you're not telling me?

31:55.540 --> 31:56.416
Yeah.

32:02.714 --> 32:04.924
Okay. I...

32:06.593 --> 32:08.595
I have something that I've been

32:10.055 --> 32:14.809
afraid to tell you because
of how you'll feel about me after.

32:18.355 --> 32:19.356
Okay.

32:21.816 --> 32:23.485
I'm on a diet.

32:24.402 --> 32:25.445
What?

32:26.571 --> 32:29.908
The costume department said
that my belly hangs over my jeans

32:29.908 --> 32:33.536
and that's why I keep pushing
your arms away.

32:33.536 --> 32:35.872
I was afraid to tell you
'cause I don't want you

32:35.872 --> 32:39.167
to think of me as this person.
Fuck!

32:39.167 --> 32:43.546
God, after everything I've been through,
I let this bullshit still get to me.

32:48.968 --> 32:50.553
Can I hold you?

33:05.276 --> 33:08.905
Can I tell you something
that I was afraid to tell you?

33:14.494 --> 33:20.250
I thought that you thought that
our relationship was just sexual

33:20.250 --> 33:24.546
and I made a mistake coming to LA
and taking it out of the bedroom.

33:27.465 --> 33:29.467
No, it was about the jeans.

33:30.343 --> 33:31.553
Che...

33:33.179 --> 33:38.351
you are the most beautiful person
I have ever seen.

33:45.442 --> 33:48.069
- You know what?
- What?

33:48.945 --> 33:51.531
I am the most beautiful person
you've ever seen.

33:54.451 --> 33:56.327
So, fuck TV.

33:56.327 --> 33:58.413
- Let's get a pizza.
- Yeah.

34:00.790 --> 34:04.252
- But thin crust, right?
- You bitch.

34:07.964 --> 34:09.841
Hey, it's Carrie. You got a minute?

34:09.841 --> 34:11.676
Sure. What's up?

34:11.676 --> 34:14.262
Well, in case you were worried,

34:15.472 --> 34:16.931
you left your jacket here.

34:16.931 --> 34:20.518
Oh, okay, well,
I'll pick it up when I get you on Tuesday.

34:20.977 --> 34:22.729
Also,

34:22.729 --> 34:27.942
I changed my mind about
the bourbon roof party on Tuesday.

34:27.942 --> 34:30.779
Is it the bourbon or the roof?

34:31.363 --> 34:33.031
It's the Tuesday.

34:33.406 --> 34:37.869
<i>I think I'm only ready for
Thursdays with us.</i>

34:37.869 --> 34:42.248
Got it. You're not ready
to book a table at Relationship Place.

34:42.749 --> 34:47.170
Yeah.
But I'm really happy with the takeout.

34:47.170 --> 34:48.546
If you're okay with that.

34:48.546 --> 34:50.590
Thursdays it is.

34:50.590 --> 34:52.509
Okay. Bye.

34:58.306 --> 34:59.224
<i>It's us!</i>

35:01.893 --> 35:03.978
That'd be hair and makeup.

35:03.978 --> 35:05.397
How's it coming?

35:07.190 --> 35:08.483
Do you have a Band-Aid?

35:11.403 --> 35:12.278
Oh, my God.

35:13.113 --> 35:15.281
I can't even imagine the headspace
you have to get in

35:15.281 --> 35:16.991
to go to work every day.

35:16.991 --> 35:20.286
Yeah, my job is a lot of pressure,
but then, so is yours, right?

35:20.286 --> 35:23.832
Actually, I think real estate may be
a little more stressful, Cyril.

35:23.832 --> 35:26.418
You only risk your life
deactivating explosives,

35:26.418 --> 35:29.170
whereas I have to take
pretentious New Yorkers out to lunch.

35:32.757 --> 35:34.551
Big shot and I are going for a smoke.

35:34.551 --> 35:35.802
Victoire, get the check,

35:35.802 --> 35:38.013
and then we'll go
to Brooklyn for baklavas.

35:41.933 --> 35:45.562
I'm not a fan of baklava or Brooklyn.

35:47.397 --> 35:50.650
So, Victoire when is the last time
you saw each other?

35:50.650 --> 35:52.527
This morning, at home.

35:52.527 --> 35:54.446
No, sorry. I meant Zed.

35:54.446 --> 35:56.406
- Yes, this morning at home.
- Whenever you're ready.

35:56.406 --> 35:57.782
He's still living in my house.

36:03.413 --> 36:05.040
Ooh, ooh.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.249
- Oh, okay.
- Sorry.

36:06.249 --> 36:08.918
- Thank you.
- We'll put that here.

36:10.337 --> 36:12.714
Hi, Seema. How's lunch?

36:12.714 --> 36:15.800
I'm coming.
He still lives with his ex-wife.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.344
I may be 20 minutes late.

36:17.344 --> 36:19.929
Oh. Well, I may be a day late.

36:19.929 --> 36:22.515
I'm having a bit of a dress issue.

36:22.515 --> 36:24.768
- Sorry 'bout that.
- No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.

36:24.768 --> 36:27.437
- I'll keep you posted, okay?
- Okay, babe.

36:30.065 --> 36:32.067
Don't get out, Rocco, no time.

36:33.443 --> 36:35.111
What's up, boss?

36:35.111 --> 36:37.530
- Where are you going?
- To my home

36:37.530 --> 36:39.699
which I don't live in with my ex-wife.

36:39.699 --> 36:41.284
She has the top two floors.

36:41.284 --> 36:43.495
I'm on the first. Separate entrance.

36:43.495 --> 36:47.457
Well, this feels like a mess,
and I'm not missing the Met for a mess.

36:47.457 --> 36:50.919
- You're such an American.
- Yes, I'm an American.

36:50.919 --> 36:52.295
No secret there.

36:52.837 --> 36:54.047
Seema!

36:58.551 --> 37:01.930
Hello. This is your male escort
and I will be putting out.

37:01.930 --> 37:04.557
Unfortunately, you will not.

37:04.891 --> 37:07.060
- What?
- Tap, tap, tap.

37:07.060 --> 37:10.980
- Seema's back in.
- You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

37:10.980 --> 37:15.110
I'm sorry, but she needs the Met more.

37:15.110 --> 37:17.946
- You'll get over it. You're a man.
- Says who?

37:17.946 --> 37:19.948
<i>Says you.</i>

37:19.948 --> 37:20.990
You okay?

37:20.990 --> 37:23.660
When did my life become
seventh grade gym class again?

37:23.660 --> 37:25.370
Don't have fun.

37:30.834 --> 37:32.836
That's hot as all get out.

37:33.420 --> 37:34.462
I get so--

37:40.593 --> 37:43.555
Baby, your shoulders feel like iron.

37:43.555 --> 37:45.682
What's goin' on up here?

37:45.682 --> 37:47.726
The Avid crashed
when I was getting my makeup done

37:47.726 --> 37:50.770
and I lost all the work
I did on my edit today.

37:50.770 --> 37:52.188
That's what's going on up there.

37:53.356 --> 37:56.943
Look, you are
about to have a very big night.

37:56.943 --> 37:58.069
Yeah.

37:58.069 --> 38:01.614
And you're always doing
everything for all of us.

38:01.614 --> 38:05.285
Why don't you let me do that thing

38:06.286 --> 38:09.539
that I do that relaxes you?

38:09.539 --> 38:12.000
Sweetie, we don't have time.

38:14.377 --> 38:15.503
Okay, fine.

38:16.004 --> 38:18.214
But I am ready from the waist up.

38:18.214 --> 38:22.218
- Nothing can get smeared or messed.
- Got it.

38:22.218 --> 38:24.304
- Only from the waist down.
- Yeah.

38:26.431 --> 38:28.808
And my editor's gonna send the new cut in,
like, 10 minutes.

38:28.808 --> 38:30.101
I only need eight.

38:30.101 --> 38:31.394
Have a seat.

38:36.399 --> 38:37.484
I just feel like I should be

38:37.484 --> 38:39.110
- double-checking something.
- Lis...

38:39.110 --> 38:40.904
you're cuttin' into my eight.

38:41.905 --> 38:43.114
Tighter, baby.

38:44.657 --> 38:45.700
It won't go any tighter.

38:45.700 --> 38:48.870
It has to! We've gotta work on
your upper body strength.

38:48.870 --> 38:51.081
Rock, please, come help your sister.

38:51.081 --> 38:53.375
I won't be party to upholding
the patriarchy

38:53.375 --> 38:55.502
and the heteronormative
standards of beauty.

38:55.502 --> 38:59.339
I totally understand and applaud
but just for today,

38:59.339 --> 39:00.715
come help your sister.

39:00.715 --> 39:02.425
Take them!

39:03.385 --> 39:04.427
- Take these.
- Okay.

39:06.179 --> 39:07.806
These boots are kinda pinchin' me.

39:07.806 --> 39:09.432
Welcome to fashion, Harry.

39:09.432 --> 39:10.600
Ready, Rock?

39:12.310 --> 39:13.186
Good, good.

39:18.525 --> 39:20.610
What is with this train?

39:20.610 --> 39:23.530
- This is crazy.
- It's not crazy.

39:24.155 --> 39:25.949
It's Valentino.

39:28.451 --> 39:30.829
Where's the van?
Where's the Sprinter?

39:31.830 --> 39:35.291
That's what I forgot, to confirm the van.

39:35.291 --> 39:37.168
- Oh, my God.
- How could you forget that?

39:37.836 --> 39:40.672
Well, I was having an orgasm,
which you said was for me,

39:40.672 --> 39:42.757
but typically, it was all about you.

39:44.801 --> 39:45.677
Well, now what?

39:45.677 --> 39:47.679
Back to me, of course. I don't know.

39:47.679 --> 39:50.598
This can't fit in a cab.
There's no limos available, so

39:50.598 --> 39:52.684
let's scoop this baby up and walk.

39:52.684 --> 39:54.561
You wanna walk 10 blocks?

39:54.561 --> 39:57.188
Ya had to have your eight minutes,

39:57.188 --> 39:58.857
you can walk 10 blocks.

39:58.857 --> 40:00.483
It was worth it, baby.
Wasn't it?

40:00.483 --> 40:02.777
'Cause it was good.
You know it was good.

40:02.777 --> 40:06.406
I don't know if it was
"walk to the Met" good, but it was good.

40:07.240 --> 40:10.952
- Oh, okay. Can you see in that thing?
- Who needs to see?

40:24.758 --> 40:26.634
Is fashion always this hot?

40:26.634 --> 40:28.636
Harry, stop <i>kvetching.</i>

40:29.846 --> 40:32.599
And these boots are really gonna hurt
goin' up all those stairs.

40:32.599 --> 40:34.184
Well, good news.

40:34.184 --> 40:36.895
Those stairs are only for celebrities,
not for us.

40:36.895 --> 40:40.607
So, no one at work is gonna see me on TV?

40:40.607 --> 40:43.234
And where am I gonna get my picture
with Rihanna?

40:43.234 --> 40:45.362
Honey, you probably won't.

40:45.779 --> 40:49.240
What? So, no stairs, no Rihanna.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.326
Why'd I even wanna go to this thing
in the first place?

40:51.326 --> 40:53.870
I have been asking myself that all week!

40:53.870 --> 40:55.455
What does that mean?

40:56.081 --> 40:58.333
<i>Fully embracing
the "Veiled Beauty" theme...</i>

40:58.333 --> 41:01.044
"Veiled Beauty"?
How 'bout "Veiled Beast"?

41:01.044 --> 41:04.047
<i>Arriving on the legendary
Met stairs is always...</i>

41:04.047 --> 41:05.674
I hope you're havin'
the worst time of your life.

41:05.674 --> 41:08.218
Anthony? I've made a terrible mistake.

41:08.218 --> 41:10.011
Please, please, come with me.

41:10.470 --> 41:12.555
- I'm back in?
- Yes, if you'll have me.

41:12.555 --> 41:13.765
How soon can you be ready?

41:13.765 --> 41:16.935
- Yesterday!
- Okay, great. I'll pick you up in 20.

41:16.935 --> 41:20.230
Okay, bye! I'm goin' to the Met Ball!

41:22.816 --> 41:26.236
This is so great.
Seema, this is fantastic.

41:26.236 --> 41:27.696
You look amazing.

41:27.696 --> 41:29.406
<i>Amore,</i> this is so beautiful.

41:29.406 --> 41:30.490
Juan Jose.

41:30.490 --> 41:32.617
<i>Amore,</i> I wanna take a little video.

41:32.617 --> 41:33.868
Right there.

41:35.328 --> 41:36.955
Anna is going to love it.

41:37.956 --> 41:41.710
This is really divine.
<i>Amore,</i> you look beautiful.

41:41.710 --> 41:43.336
I love you all so much.

41:43.336 --> 41:44.671
Guys, we killed it!

41:45.714 --> 41:46.840
Bye! <i>Ciao!</i>

41:53.596 --> 41:54.723
Looks good, babe.

41:54.723 --> 41:56.182
No. No, it doesn't.

41:56.182 --> 41:57.767
It's supposed to be
fucking sickening tight

41:57.767 --> 41:59.853
to show off her kick-ass body.

42:00.353 --> 42:01.646
You still have a half-hour.

42:01.646 --> 42:03.857
Jackie, this isn't some "Cinderella" shit!

42:03.857 --> 42:06.401
This is my life!
There aren't any magic birds or fairies

42:06.401 --> 42:10.363
who are gonna pull this together,
so just shut the fuck up, please!

42:12.991 --> 42:15.285
I think I need a "Smoke" break.

42:23.460 --> 42:26.004
Carrie, I'm so sorry.

42:26.004 --> 42:27.922
- No.
- You can't wear this.

42:27.922 --> 42:30.467
I mean, my career will be over
before it even starts.

42:30.467 --> 42:34.137
You must have something else fabulous
to wear with my cape?

42:35.680 --> 42:36.890
Wait. I--

42:37.557 --> 42:41.227
I can't just go to my closet
and find a perfect dress

42:41.227 --> 42:45.315
to wear to something
called "Veiled Beauty." I--

42:48.193 --> 42:49.611
Wait a minute,

42:52.781 --> 42:54.366
I might have something.

42:56.409 --> 42:58.036
I don't know. Maybe.

42:58.828 --> 43:00.455
I've only worn it once.

43:01.289 --> 43:02.916
It's not the best memory.

43:36.908 --> 43:41.913
<i>And just like that, I repurposed my pain.</i>
