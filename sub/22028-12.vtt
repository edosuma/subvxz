Hey. What are you
doing here?

I thought your mother
was still here.

Connor:
Yeah, you're cleared

04:40.210 --> 04:41.580
We're gonna dig in
on that now.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.290
Uh, I have a question,
actually.

04:43.290 --> 04:44.920
Do you plan on paying
any us for this?

04:44.920 --> 04:46.620
-Michaela.
-As much as I wish

04:46.620 --> 04:49.080
I could reform the entire
justice system on my own,

whoever's willing.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.830
We are all
willing and grateful

04:53.830 --> 04:56.080
for the opportunity to be a part
of something this epic.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.420
Hey, Annalise.
It's Laurel.

04:57.420 --> 04:58.710
Any update on the
baby visitation?

04:58.710 --> 05:00.540
I was thinking if we got
Isaac's investigation drop--

05:03.000 --> 05:04.880
Why didn't you
call me back last night?

05:04.880 --> 05:08.080
I was at my girlfriend's.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.750
Annalise: Jorge's lawyers
made up that evidence.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.380
Everyone in the courtroom
knew that.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.080
Then why is the D.A.
investigating me?

05:16.080 --> 05:18.080
Well, the investigation
means nothing if they
don't charge you.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.580
And if they do? Do you
understand what this
would do to Jacqueline?

05:20.580 --> 05:21.830
She's not
gonna find out.

05:21.830 --> 05:23.170
-You don't know that!
-I do, too!

05:23.170 --> 05:24.500
Listen.
If the D.A.'s office

05:24.500 --> 05:26.580
goes anywhere near you,
Jacqueline, or anyone else,

05:26.580 --> 05:27.920
I'll find out.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.170
You have Bonnie
working on this?

05:31.790 --> 05:34.330
You can trust her.

05:34.330 --> 05:36.080
You two were just trying
to destroy each other!

05:36.080 --> 05:37.250
But we worked it
all out, Isaac.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.380
Especially now
that you need us.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.750
-God knows we both owe you.
-Okay. Listen.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.580
I'm the reason why you're
in this mess. Let me fix it.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.380
It's not that, okay?
Just let me say this.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.540
Is it Stella?
-No.

05:53.540 --> 05:55.460
I can't fix anything
if you lie to me.

05:55.460 --> 05:57.580
I lied to you about
where I was last night.

05:57.580 --> 05:59.540
Not about Stella.
Never about Stella.

06:03.210 --> 06:05.920
I don't have
a girlfriend. It's...

06:11.710 --> 06:13.580
I was here.

06:14.790 --> 06:16.710
I was high.

06:25.670 --> 06:26.830
Heroin?

06:26.830 --> 06:30.170
K-pex. It's an opioid.

06:30.170 --> 06:33.380
If you want to walk
out of here right now,
I'll understand, okay?

06:37.460 --> 06:38.960
Why'd you do it?

06:40.880 --> 06:42.040
It was a mistake.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.830
A mistake that felt good?

06:43.830 --> 06:46.830
Hey, look at me! Look how much
I'm hating myself here!

06:49.000 --> 06:51.250
I was sober for 23 years
until last night,

06:51.250 --> 06:53.790
and I threw it all away
for nothing.

06:56.540 --> 06:59.290
Ohh...

06:59.290 --> 07:01.710
I'm not going down
that hole again.

07:01.710 --> 07:03.540
That's good, Isaac, because if
you do, you could go to jail.

07:03.540 --> 07:06.080
I need to be on
my best behavior now, right?

07:06.080 --> 07:09.000
No, you need to go to a meeting.
AA, NA, whatever your thing is.

07:11.830 --> 07:15.420
I lost my therapist.
My life is all stress right now.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.000
I'll go with you,
if that helps.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.920
You don't have to do that.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.920
I want to.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.580
Annalise: Ooh, finally.
This was the only thing

07:37.580 --> 07:39.250
getting me through
Cocaine Lady's whining.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.580
Really? 'Cause she just had me
thinking about the '80s.

07:41.580 --> 07:44.620
I never got into cocaine.

07:44.620 --> 07:47.250
You know,
even during law school

07:47.250 --> 07:49.580
when they were practically
serving it on trays.

07:49.580 --> 07:52.620
There was free cocaine,
and you didn't get into it?

07:52.620 --> 07:54.460
I had already discovered
vodka in undergrad,

07:54.460 --> 07:55.460
so I was good to go.

07:55.460 --> 07:57.210
Ah.

07:58.330 --> 08:01.170
Mmm. And you?
When did you start?

08:05.210 --> 08:08.920
It was after undergrad
for me. Um...

08:08.920 --> 08:10.580
I moved into New York,

08:10.580 --> 08:13.330
thinking that I was gonna
be in a band or a writer.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.460
Just as long as I wasn't
a doctor like my sisters.

08:18.460 --> 08:19.750
You know how it is.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.830
You're just trying whatever
you have the chance to.

08:21.830 --> 08:24.210
So I-I tried things.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.420
All of them.

08:27.420 --> 08:29.710
But, um...

08:29.710 --> 08:32.210
heroin...

08:34.500 --> 08:35.750
It was good.

08:41.670 --> 08:43.960
10 years later...

08:43.960 --> 08:47.670
I'm pretty much homeless,
I'm not talking to my family.

08:47.670 --> 08:49.670
Hmph.

08:49.670 --> 08:53.500
One night, I'm in line
in this bodega,

08:53.500 --> 08:55.330
and there's this girl
in front of me

08:55.330 --> 08:57.330
and she's trying to
return some potato chips,

08:57.330 --> 09:01.000
saying that the bag was open
when she, uh, bought it.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.920
The kid, the cashier says
he has to go talk to the owner,

09:03.920 --> 09:07.750
so I'm like -- I'm freaking
annoyed now, you know?

09:09.500 --> 09:12.000
So, this girl turns around,
I guess to apologize.

09:14.380 --> 09:17.620
She has this smile on her face
that just, uh...

09:21.420 --> 09:23.000
It just went
right through me.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.330
It hit me right there,

09:26.330 --> 09:28.920
and I-I knew I wanted
something else.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.210
Jacqueline. Yeah.

09:32.620 --> 09:36.460
I mean, I wanted a life
with her, too, now.

09:36.460 --> 09:38.460
But, uh...

09:40.170 --> 09:41.880
She helped me.

09:44.620 --> 09:46.960
Got me clean.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.670
Went back to school.

09:49.670 --> 09:52.580
Had Stella. Yeah.

09:52.580 --> 09:54.880
Things were good for
a long time, you know, uh...

09:54.880 --> 09:55.960
Waitress:
Fresh coffee?

09:55.960 --> 09:58.790
Yeah.

09:58.790 --> 10:00.380
Waitress: Syrup.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.750
Bonnie: I heard Denver
assigned you the Isaac Roa case.

10:06.750 --> 10:08.620
You jealous?

10:08.620 --> 10:11.210
Only because you'll get to
go up against Annalise
if you charge him.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.460
Oh, you're still holding
a grudge against her.

10:13.460 --> 10:15.670
If you knew our history,
you'd understand.

10:15.670 --> 10:17.540
Well, tell me more.

10:17.540 --> 10:20.620
Buy me a drink. Or five.
I'll tell you all of it.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.000
The point is,
if you want the help,

10:23.000 --> 10:24.420
I could look over his file,

10:24.420 --> 10:26.120
help you figure out the
Annalise defense angle.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.670
Oh, we haven't even
charged the guy yet.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.120
Then I'll help you figure out
how to charge him.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.170
You're scared I'm gonna
steal the case. Never mind.

10:35.170 --> 10:38.170
Look. All right.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.420
I surrender.

10:39.420 --> 10:41.580
Here.

10:41.580 --> 10:45.040
If you actually figure out
how to charge the guy,

10:45.040 --> 10:46.620
I'll buy you that drink.

10:46.620 --> 10:49.210
Drinks.

10:54.580 --> 10:57.080
Annalise is a great storyteller.
That's why she wins.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.170
So let's use
Nate Senior's story

10:59.170 --> 11:01.040
as the framework
for her opening.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.620
This is a civil trial.
There's no jury.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.210
The judge isn't gonna care
about some sob story.

11:04.210 --> 11:05.500
We have a face case
for a reason.

11:05.500 --> 11:08.170
Fine. You write up your version.
I'll write up mine.

11:08.170 --> 11:11.170
Or we all just
snickerdoodle...

11:11.170 --> 11:12.540
and chill.

11:12.540 --> 11:14.170
-Oh! I love the new you!
-Two, please.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.500
Look. I've been on this case
longer than any of you.

11:16.500 --> 11:19.210
We do what I say.
Sob story, it is.

11:19.210 --> 11:21.750
-If I'm lucky.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.460
You're always lucky.

11:23.460 --> 11:24.460
Why is Frank calling me?

11:26.290 --> 11:28.620
-O-man, I need that

11:28.620 --> 11:30.420
big, beautiful
brain of yours.
For what?

11:30.420 --> 11:32.040
I'm trying to use
the SS7 program

11:32.040 --> 11:33.330
to hack into
some phone records.

11:33.330 --> 11:36.080
That's for hacking
international phones.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.790
-I know that.

11:37.790 --> 11:39.790
Dominick's, obviously,
which means he and Bonnie

11:39.790 --> 11:41.620
still don't know why
Wes left that voicemail.

11:41.620 --> 11:43.420
Tell Michaela
to stay in her lane.

11:43.420 --> 11:45.830
-Frank, it's me.
-Give the phone back to Oliver.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.290
Laurel: Is Michaela right? Are
you hacking Dominick's phone?

11:48.290 --> 11:50.080
-No.
-Frank, if you do anything

11:50.080 --> 11:52.210
to piss my father off
right now,

11:52.210 --> 11:56.170
he is going to figure out a way
to block me from seeing my son.

11:56.170 --> 11:57.500
So stop, okay?

11:57.500 --> 11:59.080
Okay.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.330
Are your fingers
crossed?

12:01.330 --> 12:03.250
I heard you. I'll stop.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.750
Thank you.

12:07.580 --> 12:09.210
Annalise: You've been doing
so well during our prep,

12:09.210 --> 12:12.420
I've decided to call you as
my first witness in the trial.

12:12.420 --> 12:14.880
Mm. You say that
like you're surprised.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.290
I'm impressed.

12:17.290 --> 12:19.380
That means that we have to
go over your testimony again.

12:19.380 --> 12:21.500
No. No.
I'm sick of myself.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.960
Yeah, but the more
you tell your story,

12:23.960 --> 12:26.170
the easier it'll be
for you on the stand.

12:26.170 --> 12:27.880
And it means more time
out of the SHU.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.830
It's not a bad deal,
right?

12:30.830 --> 12:33.580
Connor: "Nathaniel Lahey Senior
was just 26 years old

12:33.580 --> 12:35.790
when his life was hijacked
by the justice system.

Before that, he was
just your average man

12:39.880 --> 12:41.540
A man's got one job
in my book.

12:41.540 --> 12:44.000
That's to put food
in his kid's mouth.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.830
No. I did what I had to do,
took what I needed.

12:46.830 --> 12:49.080
-You stole what you needed.
-You watch your kids be hungry.

See if you don't steal
some food stamps, cash,

know who Jay-Z is.
No, it's not about Jay-Z.

probation infraction
