WEBVTT

00:04.600 --> 00:06.367
What you got?

00:07.300 --> 00:08.533
Bloody hell.

00:08.567 --> 00:11.367
ANDY: Is that...?
LANCE: Blimey, mate.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.533
Let me see.

00:13.567 --> 00:16.100
That is beautiful.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.767
Is that what I think it is?

00:18.800 --> 00:22.533
It's a ruddy spearhead, mate.
Incredible condition.

00:22.567 --> 00:25.500
- Medieval?
- Well, earlier, I'd say.

00:25.533 --> 00:27.667
I don't know.
Could it be Roman?

00:27.700 --> 00:30.067
Unbelievable.
You got some water to clean it?

00:30.100 --> 00:31.267
Er...

00:31.300 --> 00:33.300
Well, there's a water tank
over there.

00:49.333 --> 00:50.767
(Sighs)

01:06.200 --> 01:09.067
No, I knew there was something
fishy going on.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.133
You bloody liar.
You nearly wet yourself.

01:11.167 --> 01:13.100
You said it was
in incredible condition.

01:13.133 --> 01:14.533
Well, exactly.

01:14.567 --> 01:17.033
It was the condition
told me something was wrong.

01:17.067 --> 01:18.333
There was no age to it.

01:18.367 --> 01:20.200
I wish I hadn't seen
the railings,

01:20.233 --> 01:23.400
- I'd still have a spearhead.
- Well...

01:23.433 --> 01:24.600
Now you know how it feels

01:24.633 --> 01:27.400
to have your treasure
snatched away so cruelly

01:27.433 --> 01:29.433
from right under your nose.

01:29.467 --> 01:32.433
It feels like crap.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.733
Wait a minute.
It's the same, isn't it?

01:35.767 --> 01:37.333
What's the same as what?

01:37.367 --> 01:39.300
The same as me
losing my gold coin.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.667
Not even nearly the same.

01:40.700 --> 01:43.167
That's a sign, a clue.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.200
Are you building up to one of
your bits of mystic wisdom?

01:47.233 --> 01:52.067
There's something about...
karma going on.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.767
You're not gonna get in any book
of quotations with that, mate.

01:56.067 --> 01:57.700
(Sighs)

02:01.500 --> 02:04.767
The thing is,
we have to redress the balance,

02:04.800 --> 02:07.467
get our own back
on those idiots.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.800
It's all a question of karma.

02:09.833 --> 02:12.567
When I think about karma,
I see it as a good thing.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.433
Like, if you do something nice,

02:14.467 --> 02:16.233
something nice
will happen to you.

02:16.267 --> 02:18.300
But you see it
as a tool for revenge.

02:18.333 --> 02:21.167
Well, what do you suggest?

02:21.200 --> 02:23.700
Just let them on the land
for God's sake.

02:23.733 --> 02:26.500
Let everyone in.
Get a band. Have a festival.

02:26.533 --> 02:29.100
You lose the farm in a few days
anyway, don't you?

02:29.133 --> 02:31.633
But what if one of them
finds my hoard?

02:31.667 --> 02:34.100
Then at least
it will have been found.

02:34.133 --> 02:37.833
Anyway, I thought you said
his detector was an antique?

02:37.867 --> 02:40.300
It is. It's a twat's detector.

02:40.333 --> 02:44.733
There you go again, being mean.
Stop being a bully.

02:44.767 --> 02:47.700
Just play nicely
with the other detectorists

02:47.733 --> 02:50.333
and then nice things
will start to happen.

02:51.633 --> 02:54.167
Whoo-hoo! My very own ship.

02:55.767 --> 02:58.100
- It's a boat!
- No. I've upgraded it.

02:58.133 --> 03:00.267
Today it's a ship.
Come on, Dad.

03:02.467 --> 03:03.733
Here.

03:08.067 --> 03:10.067
Yeah, I...

03:10.100 --> 03:11.600
I don't know if I...

03:11.633 --> 03:14.100
Oh, Dad, please
just have a glass of wine.

03:14.133 --> 03:19.333
Yeah.
Water looks a bit choppy today.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.533
It's like a mirror.
What are you talking about?

03:21.567 --> 03:23.333
It'll be fine.

03:25.533 --> 03:26.800
Thank you.

03:33.567 --> 03:35.267
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

03:36.800 --> 03:40.100
- Cheers!
KATE: It's not so bad, is it?

03:40.133 --> 03:42.400
No, not so bad.

03:49.267 --> 03:50.700
BECKY: Look at these two, Mum.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.600
Do you see what they're making?

03:55.633 --> 03:56.767
VERONICA: A house.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.633
It's the house we went to see.

03:58.667 --> 04:01.633
He can't stop thinking about it.

04:01.667 --> 04:04.467
- He needs a place of his own.
- I know.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.300
He's been making homes
for hedgehogs

04:07.333 --> 04:09.267
and putting up bat boxes.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.733
Some sort of nesting instinct
kicking in.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.399
- When's the auction?
- Sunday.

04:16.433 --> 04:19.233
- You thinking of going along?
- I don't know what else to do.

04:19.267 --> 04:21.500
He's got it in his head
we're gonna win it.

04:21.533 --> 04:24.433
I'm worried when we don't,
it's gonna hit him hard.

04:35.133 --> 04:37.533
This is a big moment for me,
because, as you all know,

04:37.567 --> 04:40.500
I have been working on this
for a long time.

04:40.533 --> 04:42.733
And there were moments
on the journey

04:42.767 --> 04:46.500
when I was quite despairing
of ever getting this far.

04:46.533 --> 04:48.500
And there is
only one person to thank

04:48.533 --> 04:50.533
for getting me through
those dark days,

04:50.567 --> 04:54.067
and that is, of course, my own
darling Sheila, without whom...

04:54.100 --> 04:56.567
Come on, Terry, just show us,
never mind the speeches.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.167
We all know how great Sheila is.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.400
Have you got it there?
Let's have a look.

05:00.433 --> 05:03.667
Let me just explain that this is
only the proof copy.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.700
The actual finished product
will have a much better...

05:06.733 --> 05:07.867
Just show us!

05:07.900 --> 05:11.367
Terry Cloth! Terry Cloth!
Terry Cloth! Terry Cloth...

05:11.400 --> 05:14.100
Yeah, yeah. All right,
all right, all right, all right.

05:14.133 --> 05:15.733
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

05:15.767 --> 05:20.567
Common Buttons of North West
Essex by Terence Seymour.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.300
Hooray!

05:22.333 --> 05:24.667
- (Both whistle)
- Whoo!

05:26.133 --> 05:27.267
Oh, I'm not expecting

05:27.300 --> 05:30.267
to make the New York Times
Best Seller list obviously.

05:30.300 --> 05:34.533
It would be nice, but...
well, the Co-op on Emsdale Road

05:34.567 --> 05:36.367
say they're gonna stock
a few copies.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.833
So we'll take it from there,
see how it goes.

05:38.867 --> 05:41.133
What's the print run on this,
Terry?

05:41.167 --> 05:44.133
TERRY: Initial print run of 45.
- Thousand?

05:44.167 --> 05:45.367
No, 45.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.200
So there'll be one
for each of you

05:47.233 --> 05:49.467
and a bunch left over
for the general public.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.533
- Will you sign mine?
- Certainly will, young Hugh.

05:51.567 --> 05:53.667
I'll probably sign
all the first editions.

05:53.700 --> 05:56.233
Could you leave mine blank,
it'll be worth more.

05:56.267 --> 05:59.133
He could be the next JK Rowling.

05:59.167 --> 06:02.800
Well, I doubt it'll spawn
a movie franchise

06:02.833 --> 06:04.667
and a theme park, darling.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.533
- Button World. I'd go.
- Mm.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.767
It does sound like
a good day out, admittedly.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.400
Speaking of a good day out,

06:11.433 --> 06:13.333
Lance and I
have got a proposition.

06:13.367 --> 06:15.700
You know we're losing
our permission on Monday.

06:15.733 --> 06:17.800
Well, we've decided
it's time to open it up.

06:17.833 --> 06:20.700
Get everyone down there for the
last day and blitz the place.

06:20.733 --> 06:22.767
See what there is
before it's covered over.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.600
About bloody time. You think
there's still more to find?

06:25.633 --> 06:28.267
Who knows, Terry,
but we could do with your help.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.500
It's going to be
a nice day on Sunday.

06:30.533 --> 06:32.133
It is. Yeah.

06:32.167 --> 06:35.367
And guess what I took
delivery of this very morning.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.500
What?

06:36.533 --> 06:39.833
- Brand spanking new gazebo.
- How big?

06:39.867 --> 06:43.733
- Three metres by nine.
- Phew!

06:43.767 --> 06:45.267
Bring it along, Teryllium,

06:45.300 --> 06:47.367
and we can stick
the finds table underneath -

06:47.400 --> 06:48.700
you could shift a few books.

06:48.733 --> 06:51.400
Well, you heard the man.
These boys need our help.

06:51.433 --> 06:55.200
- Full turn out, no excuses.
- There is just one thing.

06:55.233 --> 06:57.433
We may not be
the only ones there.

07:18.367 --> 07:20.800
Bloody hell. This is grim.

07:22.333 --> 07:25.600
Welly, welly, well, well, well.

07:26.733 --> 07:29.633
Look who's come crawling back.

07:29.667 --> 07:31.600
- I can't do this.
- Mate!

07:33.600 --> 07:38.233
Look who it is. It's the
Danebury Metal Detecting Club.

07:38.267 --> 07:39.767
(Chuckles)

07:39.800 --> 07:41.667
- That is our name.
- I know.

07:43.367 --> 07:44.333
You were saying it

07:44.367 --> 07:46.633
like you were making up
some funny name for us.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.667
Ooh, if I were to make up
a funny name for you...

07:49.700 --> 07:51.767
it'd be a hell of a lot funnier
than that,

07:51.800 --> 07:54.100
- believe you me.
- Would it?

07:54.133 --> 07:55.700
Oh, yes.

07:55.733 --> 07:58.200
You said you could get
a preservation order

07:58.233 --> 08:01.533
- put on that tree.
- That's the trick, isn't it?

08:01.567 --> 08:06.433
Tree preservation orders
don't just... materialise.

08:06.467 --> 08:08.633
We have made quite clear
our demands.

08:08.667 --> 08:11.800
Nice to see you apply the same
ethics to your bat conservation

08:11.833 --> 08:13.733
as you do
to your metal detecting.

08:13.767 --> 08:16.233
You're not interested in bats.

08:16.267 --> 08:17.700
Why do you want to save
that tree?

08:17.733 --> 08:19.500
And what have you found
in that field

08:19.533 --> 08:21.367
that you're guarding it
so closely?

08:21.400 --> 08:25.200
Well, if you help us,
we'll tell you.

08:25.233 --> 08:27.600
- We can detect on the field?
ANDY: For one day.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.767
The last day before we lose it.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.400
The entire field, just the two
of us, for the whole day?

08:32.433 --> 08:34.633
Now that we cannot agree to.

08:34.667 --> 08:36.767
This time
we're gonna do it properly.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.433
No more sneaking about.

08:38.467 --> 08:42.232
We're gonna hold a rally
with a £5 entrance fee,

08:42.267 --> 08:45.067
and at the end of the day
we'll donate that money

08:45.100 --> 08:47.333
to your
bat conservation charity.

08:47.367 --> 08:49.467
If you can save that tree.

08:49.500 --> 08:53.700
- A proper organised rally?
- Yeah. That's the deal.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.100
We'll get the County Finds
Liaison Officer down

08:56.133 --> 08:58.100
to record everything
so it's above board.

08:58.133 --> 09:00.367
Take it or leave it.
That's our final offer.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.800
Will there be a barbecue?

09:01.833 --> 09:04.500
I heard sometimes
they have a barbecue.

09:04.533 --> 09:06.167
Uh...

09:06.200 --> 09:09.100
Well, yeah,
if the weather's nice.

09:09.133 --> 09:14.267
- And will there be a... gazebo?
- There will be a gazebo, yeah.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.567
- Terry's got a new gazebo.
- A new one?

09:16.600 --> 09:20.233
Well, we can maybe come down
early and help set that up.

09:20.267 --> 09:26.300
- You could if you wanted.
- The thing is, we're not...

09:26.333 --> 09:29.533
- We haven't got...
- What is it?

09:29.567 --> 09:31.567
We're not currently members

09:31.600 --> 09:35.067
of the National Council
for Metal Detecting.

09:35.867 --> 09:39.067
Oh... I see.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.533
It's been tough
the last few years with...

09:42.600 --> 09:46.233
After the er... the troubles.

09:46.267 --> 09:49.567
It's been difficult
to get references.

09:49.600 --> 09:54.267
Well, we could make you honorary
DMDC members for the day.

09:54.300 --> 09:57.033
Mm. Don't see why not.

09:57.067 --> 09:59.133
(Exhales)

09:59.167 --> 10:01.433
Well, that would be nice.

10:01.467 --> 10:04.400
I mean, that sounds good.
Paul, can you...

10:06.300 --> 10:09.033
Oh, do you...
Do you need a little tissue?

10:09.067 --> 10:12.000
- Yes, please.
- Help yourself.

10:14.133 --> 10:15.733
Thanks.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.067
And definitely
no-one could touch it?

10:27.100 --> 10:28.100
Not for six months.

10:28.133 --> 10:31.533
By which time
you'll have bats in your boxes.

10:31.567 --> 10:34.433
You said there
was gonna be a rally.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.467
Is there still gonna be a rally?

10:38.233 --> 10:40.167
Here they come.

11:04.767 --> 11:06.367
I'll see you in a minute,
darling.

11:13.533 --> 11:15.300
I hear you're good with gazebos.

11:16.867 --> 11:20.600
Well, it's been a while.

11:20.633 --> 11:22.800
No matter.
We can always use a hand.

11:22.833 --> 11:25.433
Hurry up now,
we've got a gazebo to erect,

11:25.467 --> 11:27.433
and we don't have all day
to do it.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.233
(Indistinct chatter)

11:39.600 --> 11:41.667
(Soundtrack over dialogue)

11:47.467 --> 11:49.233
Steady!

11:50.767 --> 11:52.700
(Soundtrack over dialogue)

12:19.200 --> 12:20.300
Lance.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.767
Oh! Thank you, Sheila.

12:38.067 --> 12:39.600
(Phil splutters)

12:51.233 --> 12:56.467
Glorious day to be here as
we say farewell to a long-loved

12:56.500 --> 12:59.567
and, I understand,
recently productive permission.

12:59.600 --> 13:04.067
Thank you to Lance and Andy
for opening it up for us all.

13:04.100 --> 13:07.500
And welcome to our new friends,
Paul and Phil.

13:07.533 --> 13:10.000
(Smattering of applause)

13:11.867 --> 13:16.800
- Chaps, what can you tell us?
- Thank you, Teralene.

13:16.833 --> 13:21.433
Well, folks, we think
we've got a Roman burial,

13:21.467 --> 13:23.333
or the remains thereof.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.633
We've found parts
of a cremation urn,

13:25.667 --> 13:29.367
parts of another pot and
various contemporary artefacts,

13:29.400 --> 13:33.500
including the infamous
gold Septimius Severus,

13:33.533 --> 13:36.400
which was found
on this very spot.

13:36.433 --> 13:39.500
Yeah, mainly concentrated
in this area here, up this end,

13:39.533 --> 13:42.833
but Roman coming up all over
this field and beyond, so...

13:42.867 --> 13:46.233
So, loads of land to
choose from, ladies and gents.

13:46.267 --> 13:49.633
Coils to the soil,
have a great day's detecting.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.433
(All cheer)

14:02.567 --> 14:06.000
Guys? Guys,
can we spread out a bit?

14:08.067 --> 14:09.333
Guys?

14:10.433 --> 14:12.267
(Shouts) Guys! Guys!

14:12.300 --> 14:15.100
Look, can we all
spread out a bit?

14:15.133 --> 14:16.633
Look at yourselves! Come on!

14:16.667 --> 14:19.800
Move out a bit. Come on.
Shoo! Go on.

14:19.833 --> 14:22.067
Yee-ha! Go on!

14:22.100 --> 14:26.000
Yee-ha! Go on, get out.

14:51.800 --> 14:55.333
Ah. I knew
you wouldn't be able to resist.

14:55.367 --> 14:57.767
I thought I'd better come
and see what it's all about,

14:57.800 --> 14:59.567
find out
what I'm sharing you with.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.100
Well, prepare to be transported

15:02.133 --> 15:04.333
into a world of wonder
and adventure.

15:04.367 --> 15:07.467
Righto! Have you found anything?

15:07.500 --> 15:09.067
Hey, Toni, how's it going?

15:09.100 --> 15:10.767
Mate, I've left my stuff
up by the tree,

15:10.800 --> 15:13.100
I'll be back in an hour.
Don't find anything.

15:13.133 --> 15:15.733
- Where are you going?
- Nipping off to buy a house.

15:15.767 --> 15:17.433
You need anything?

15:17.467 --> 15:19.000
Uh, no. OK. Cheers.

15:20.733 --> 15:21.833
Oh!

15:21.867 --> 15:24.433
Decide on your price
and stick to it.

15:40.167 --> 15:43.100
So with the money from your car,
that's 15 grand we've got tops?

15:43.133 --> 15:44.467
- Yeah.
- All right.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.800
We'll just see how it goes.

15:45.833 --> 15:48.233
If we get it, we get it,
if not...

15:48.267 --> 15:49.367
Yeah.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.133
- Let me do the bidding.
- Really?

15:51.167 --> 15:52.600
Yeah, I know how to do it.

15:52.633 --> 15:55.033
You hold up the card
to raise the bid £1,000,

15:55.067 --> 15:58.167
and then you do that
to raise it 500.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.567
- You think you can handle it?
- Don't mean to brag, darling,

16:01.600 --> 16:03.700
but I've been watching
these programmes for years

16:03.733 --> 16:05.467
while you've been at work.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.767
I think I know what I'm doing.

16:20.267 --> 16:22.233
- Have you got the card?
- What card?

16:22.267 --> 16:24.700
The card with the number on
that you wave to bid?

16:24.733 --> 16:25.733
Where do we get the card?

16:25.767 --> 16:28.567
- I don't think we need that.
- Are you sure?

16:28.600 --> 16:31.100
The ones on YouTube
usually have a card.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.367
They've all got cards,
I knew it.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.333
Excuse me, are we
supposed to have a card

16:59.367 --> 17:01.733
with a number on it...to wave?

17:12.200 --> 17:14.367
AUCTIONEER:
Lot 3 - property 65-65-66-3H,

17:14.400 --> 17:17.200
1930s midi-terraced cottagette.

17:17.233 --> 17:18.400
- What was that?
- Ssh.

17:18.433 --> 17:19.800
Ours is the one after this.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.666
Just watch
and see how they do it.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.532
..excitement in the room,
lot of excitement on the phones.

17:24.567 --> 17:27.267
So, twin contracts of ownership,
rental guidelines,

17:27.300 --> 17:29.500
pertaining potential
under clauses pending.

17:29.533 --> 17:31.500
Agents charges come under
Section 17, Part 3,

17:31.533 --> 17:34.033
but merchants and contractors
can waive severance in person

17:34.067 --> 17:35.600
within 21 days.
So, what have we got?

17:35.633 --> 17:37.733
Start me over, if you like.
There, now, there.

17:37.767 --> 17:39.467
- What's he saying?
- Get me going.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.667
Where you gonna be?
Am I gonna find you?

17:41.700 --> 17:44.733
Going to feel my eye.
Draw it to you.

17:44.767 --> 17:47.767
Bring me an opener. Somebody?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.367
45 I have, thank you, sir.
Do I see 46? 46 I see.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.633
Do I see 47?
May I say 48?

17:51.667 --> 17:54.200
48 for you now.
Is it 49? 49, 49, 49, 49, 49.

17:54.233 --> 17:56.267
No. Do I have 49?
49, I have. 50?

17:56.300 --> 17:58.800
50 I'm bid. Fresh bid.
Do I have 51? 51 I have.

17:58.833 --> 18:00.667
52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57.

18:00.700 --> 18:03.167
57, 57.
I'm selling at £57,000.

18:03.200 --> 18:06.167
One, twice, three times, sold.
Thank you. Moving on.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.667
What even was that? Jesus!

18:10.700 --> 18:13.433
It's not like this on
Property Lottery!

18:17.233 --> 18:18.500
(Beeping)

18:29.633 --> 18:31.267
Nice button.

18:32.767 --> 18:34.400
Welsh Guards.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.233
Second Infantry.

18:48.433 --> 18:52.333
Next up, lot 44-12D,
Tattersdown Cottage.

18:52.367 --> 18:54.300
- This is it, this is us.
- Is it?

18:54.333 --> 18:57.033
I don't understand a word
he's saying, I honestly don't.

18:57.067 --> 18:58.267
Keep calm, concentrate.

18:58.300 --> 19:02.733
Grab me in, somebody, across
my starting block. Pitch it up.

19:02.767 --> 19:06.600
We are tick, tick, ticking.
Are you forward, are you aft?

19:06.633 --> 19:09.567
Thank you. £15,000 I'm bid.
Do I hear £16,000 anywhere?

19:09.600 --> 19:10.833
No? No 16?

19:10.867 --> 19:15.100
£15,000 then. Any more?
No more bids at £15,000?

19:15.133 --> 19:16.833
15,500. Fresh bid.
Thank you very much.

19:16.867 --> 19:19.367
Do I hear 16? 16 I have.
Do I hear 17, sir?

19:19.400 --> 19:21.833
16,500, sir? Very well.

19:21.867 --> 19:26.333
I'm selling at £16,000 for the
first, second and third time...

19:26.367 --> 19:28.567
Fresh bid, £17,000
at the back of the room there.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.600
Thank you very much, madam.
18, do I hear 18?

19:30.633 --> 19:32.733
18, 19, 20, 21,

19:32.767 --> 19:35.300
22, 23, 24.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.033
Do I hear 25? 25?

19:37.067 --> 19:39.333
No, the bid is £24,000
at the back of the room.

19:39.367 --> 19:43.067
Any advance on £24,000?
Selling once, twice...

19:43.100 --> 19:45.133
£30,000, a fresh bid
on the phone there.

19:45.167 --> 19:47.467
Do I hear 35, madam? 35 I have.
40 on the phone.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.133
45 I have. 50 on the phone.

19:49.167 --> 19:51.133
Do I hear 55, madam?
Thank you very much.

19:51.167 --> 19:52.267
All out on the phone.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.800
Any more bids in the room
before I sell to this lady

19:54.833 --> 19:56.700
at the back of the room
for £55,000?

19:56.733 --> 19:59.700
Selling, once, twice,
three times and sold.

19:59.733 --> 20:01.800
Thank you very much. Moving on.

20:04.667 --> 20:07.367
- What have you done?
- It's all right.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.467
They'll send people round,
they'll take us down.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.767
- It's all right, Andy.
- We'll go to prison.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.367
- Andy.
- You'll go to prison.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.067
My mum's gonna lend us
the money. I've got it here.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.567
Why didn't you fucking tell me?
I nearly passed out.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.267
It's ours, Andy. We won it.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.533
I can't feel my legs.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.800
Come on then, I dare you.
Let's swap for an hour.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.400
(Chuckles) All right.

21:16.867 --> 21:18.733
Now, you're gonna
have to be careful,

21:18.767 --> 21:21.367
cos this is gonna be like
a Formula One racing car.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.233
You're not
gonna be used to the power.

21:23.267 --> 21:25.533
Honestly, look at
this ridiculous thing.

21:25.567 --> 21:27.600
I mean,
it does everything for you.

21:27.633 --> 21:29.800
You don't feel like
you have any control.

21:29.833 --> 21:32.600
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Where do you shovel in the coal?

21:32.633 --> 21:34.767
I'm assuming
this is steam driven?

21:34.800 --> 21:37.733
What's this?
You got "spoons" mode.

21:37.767 --> 21:39.533
It's a bit specific, isn't it?

21:39.567 --> 21:42.600
Well, not if you're searching in
an old cutlery dump, it isn't.

21:42.633 --> 21:46.833
See the Arado, it's sleek,
elegant and minimalist.

21:46.867 --> 21:49.567
This is vulgar,
like a monster truck.

21:49.600 --> 21:54.533
- What year is this?
- It's an original. 1978.

21:54.567 --> 21:56.200
- Is it really?
- Mm-hm.

21:56.233 --> 22:00.200
Is it? Oh. Same as my Triumph.
Yeah.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.133
Ah! Ha-ha!

22:03.167 --> 22:04.500
(Sniffs)

22:04.533 --> 22:07.533
Mm! Yeah, there it is.

22:09.633 --> 22:15.700
- 1978, well, I never.
- Unmistakable. A good year?

22:15.733 --> 22:18.400
- They'll be 40 soon.
- The big 4-0.

22:18.433 --> 22:22.500
Here, I might have to take

22:22.533 --> 22:25.000
a little photograph of them
together later.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.467
I like the way your mind ticks.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.067
(Both chuckle)

23:18.600 --> 23:21.100
- How are your legs?
- Yeah, still a bit trembly.

23:23.833 --> 23:26.733
Ooh, there's Toni looking bored.
You go and play.

23:26.767 --> 23:29.233
- I love you.
- I love you.

23:29.267 --> 23:32.200
Hurry up and find some gold!
We've never been skinter!

23:41.533 --> 23:42.633
Hey, mate!

23:44.267 --> 23:45.467
Mate, I'm a homeow...

23:48.100 --> 23:51.300
What, mate?
All I got was you're a homo.

23:51.333 --> 23:55.400
- Homeowner. I'm a home owner.
- No way, mate? You won it?

23:55.433 --> 23:57.533
- Bloody won it.
- Oh, congratulations.

23:57.567 --> 23:58.667
With 12 grand?

23:58.700 --> 24:01.033
- Well, no, we had to go over.
- Oh.

24:01.067 --> 24:04.333
- Who did the bidding, you?
- Yeah, yeah, me, yeah.

24:04.367 --> 24:06.767
- With the little card?
- All of that, you know.

24:06.800 --> 24:10.733
(Laughs) Well, nice one, mate.
Congratulations.

24:10.767 --> 24:13.633
Hang on a sec.
What's going on? What's that?

24:13.667 --> 24:16.233
Oh, yeah, I'm trying it out.
My idea.

24:16.267 --> 24:17.767
You know what,
it's not half bad.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.033
That's embarrassing.

24:20.067 --> 24:22.367
Leave you alone
for a couple of hours.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.700
Simple, but effective.

24:37.333 --> 24:40.300
TERRY: Well, a good day, all.

24:40.333 --> 24:43.733
No gold, unfortunately,
despite the earlier false alarm.

24:43.767 --> 24:45.467
Sorry.
Shouldn't have done that dance.

24:45.500 --> 24:48.100
Oh, I am all for dancing, Paul,

24:48.133 --> 24:50.100
as any of these people
will tell you,

24:50.133 --> 24:52.767
but in the field
we only dance for gold.

24:52.800 --> 24:55.400
I didn't expect everybody
to run towards me like that.

24:55.433 --> 24:57.533
(Chuckles)
No, as I say, no gold,

24:57.567 --> 25:01.600
and I feel we've found
all there is to be found.

25:01.633 --> 25:04.300
If there was a grave here,
I think, unfortunately,

25:04.333 --> 25:07.167
it has been lost to time
and the plough.

25:07.200 --> 25:12.433
And with that, I suggest we
all retire to the Two Brewers,

25:12.467 --> 25:15.733
where the first round
is most definitely on me.

25:17.133 --> 25:19.100
Come on, then. I'll race you.

25:21.133 --> 25:26.267
- Are you coming?
- Yeah. I was just gonna...

25:30.433 --> 25:33.300
- Do you need a moment alone?
- Do you mind?

25:33.333 --> 25:35.133
Would you mind?

25:44.367 --> 25:47.167
So that's it, then.
Wasn't meant to be.

25:49.367 --> 25:53.700
- Nope, not this time.
- What do we do now?

25:55.300 --> 25:58.300
Find a new permission.
Carry on, mate.

25:58.333 --> 25:59.533
Gotta keep searching.

26:00.700 --> 26:03.233
I don't know why we do it.

26:03.267 --> 26:08.567
- No? I do.
- I thought you probably would.

26:08.600 --> 26:12.233
- Time travel.
- Go on.

26:14.267 --> 26:18.633
Metal detecting is the closest
you'll get to time travel.

26:18.667 --> 26:22.800
See, archaeologists,
they gather up the facts,

26:22.833 --> 26:25.367
piece the jigsaw together.

26:25.400 --> 26:28.033
Work out how we lived and
find the buildings we lived in,

26:28.067 --> 26:31.700
but what we do is...
it's different.

26:33.667 --> 26:36.767
We unearth
the scattered memories,

26:36.800 --> 26:39.967
mine for stories,
fill in the personality.

26:43.700 --> 26:45.467
Detectorists.

26:46.767 --> 26:48.233
We're time travellers.

26:50.633 --> 26:53.467
Yeah, all right,
I'll give you that one.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.300
- Pub?
- Go on, then.

27:11.367 --> 27:12.500
(Chirps)

27:12.533 --> 27:17.400
* Will you search
the lonely earth for me?

27:17.433 --> 27:22.233
* Climb through
the briar and bramble?

27:22.267 --> 27:26.033
* I'll be your treasure

27:26.067 --> 27:28.000
(Coins clink)

27:32.333 --> 27:36.800
* I felt the touch of the kings
and the breath of the wind

27:36.833 --> 27:39.733
* I knew the call
of all the song birds

27:39.767 --> 27:45.367
* They sang all the wrong words

27:45.400 --> 27:49.567
* I'm waiting for you

27:49.600 --> 27:53.267
* I'm waiting for you

28:06.367 --> 28:11.467
* Would you drift o'er
the rolling fields for me?

28:11.500 --> 28:16.100
* Hold me in the highest bough?

28:16.133 --> 28:20.767
* I'll be your treasure

28:26.600 --> 28:31.200
* But in history's rhyme
there's a place and a time

28:31.233 --> 28:36.733
* And a truth to the gold
that the folds cannot hold

28:39.067 --> 28:42.467
* I'm waiting for you

28:43.533 --> 28:48.467
* I'm waiting for you
