00:08.167 --> 00:15.335
♪

00:15.335 --> 00:16.210
(Director) You ready, Abby?

00:16.210 --> 00:17.168
(Abby) Yeah.

00:17.168 --> 00:18.252
(Director) And action!

00:19.544 --> 00:21.877
How many of you know that the
traditional New England clambake

00:21.877 --> 00:25.086
began with Native
American tribes?

00:25.086 --> 00:26.961
Years before the Europeans
got here

00:26.961 --> 00:29.669
they were cooking their
lobsters, corn and mussels

00:29.669 --> 00:32.461
in sand pits along
the beach.

00:32.461 --> 00:35.336
Of course, they were using beach
stones to retain the heat

00:35.336 --> 00:37.044
and it took all day.

00:37.044 --> 00:38.712
But if you haven't got
that kind of time

00:38.712 --> 00:40.794
and you can't make it
to the beach

00:40.794 --> 00:43.837
then this is an excellent way
to bring the beach to you.

00:43.837 --> 00:46.002
Well, she certainly knows
her stuff.

00:46.002 --> 00:49.628
That's why her followers have
doubled in the past six months.

00:49.628 --> 00:53.170
As always, the table setting is
just as important as the food.

00:53.170 --> 00:54.753
In this case go traditional.

00:54.753 --> 01:00.379
A blue striped table
cloth and napkins with
seashell accents...

01:00.379 --> 01:02.045
this meal can get
a little messy,

01:02.045 --> 01:05.212
if you do it right, so don't
forget the bibs.

01:05.212 --> 01:08.087
The key is the authenticity
she projects.

01:08.087 --> 01:10.671
She's bigger than a web series,
don't you think?

01:10.671 --> 01:11.671
Where did you find her?

01:11.671 --> 01:13.337
We met in college.

01:13.337 --> 01:14.546
New England, of course?

01:14.546 --> 01:16.170
Yale.

01:16.170 --> 01:17.337
Excellent.

01:17.337 --> 01:19.462
The simplest things can make
the biggest impact.

01:19.462 --> 01:23.170
Buckets for the shells or a
fishing net for a tablecloth.

01:23.170 --> 01:26.546
And if you don't have it then
ask a friend because they might.

01:26.546 --> 01:28.504
And after all,
what are friends for?

01:28.504 --> 01:31.671
As we say in New England, fun
doesn't have to be expensive.

01:31.671 --> 01:33.338
Imagination is free.

01:33.338 --> 01:37.296
Recipes and instructions for our
accessories are on our website.

01:37.296 --> 01:38.921
For now, this is Abby Porter,

01:38.921 --> 01:42.380
and you've been watching
New England My Way.

01:42.380 --> 01:43.755
I'll see you next time.

01:43.755 --> 01:45.088
And we're out.

01:45.088 --> 01:46.505
Nice work, Jacob.

01:46.505 --> 01:49.296
Can you get some inserts of the
food while it's still steaming?

01:49.296 --> 01:50.797
I need this online by 5:00.

01:50.797 --> 01:51.672
Sure.

01:51.672 --> 01:54.505
Abby Porter,
Michael Carrington.

01:54.505 --> 01:55.880
Of Carrington Enterprises.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.296
The biggest chain of home-goods
stores in New England.

01:58.296 --> 02:01.338
Like the rads say, 'If it's New
England, it's Carrington'.

02:01.338 --> 02:02.839
It's nice to meet you.

02:02.839 --> 02:06.297
And your enterprises.

02:06.297 --> 02:08.797
It's uh, quite the set-up
you have here.

02:08.797 --> 02:10.256
My mother loans us her kitchen

02:10.256 --> 02:12.714
and Jacob handles the video,
sound and lights,

02:12.714 --> 02:14.839
and Gina handles
everything else.

02:14.839 --> 02:18.256
Publicity and management,
all on a shoe string.

02:18.256 --> 02:19.339
For now.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.423
But we have big, big plans,

02:21.423 --> 02:23.631
and we're hoping you might
be a part of them.

02:23.631 --> 02:26.673
I'm always on the lookout
for new talent

02:26.673 --> 02:28.881
and you, Abby, you
show real promise.

02:28.881 --> 02:30.339
I mean, everything
looks delicious.

02:30.339 --> 02:31.506
It's a family recipe.

02:31.506 --> 02:34.132
An old New England
family recipe, yes?

02:34.132 --> 02:35.381
New England My Way.

02:35.381 --> 02:37.464
Great name by the way.

02:37.464 --> 02:38.340
Love it.

02:38.340 --> 02:39.424
It's authentic
and that's exactly

02:39.424 --> 02:41.007
what we're looking for,
Authenticity.

02:41.007 --> 02:43.340
Well if that's what
you're after look no further.

02:43.340 --> 02:46.798
Her roots go deep into
the Connecticut soil.

02:46.798 --> 02:49.840
Hmm. Abby, you and Carrington's
might be the perfect fit.

02:49.840 --> 02:53.965
Forty-seven stores,
six states, exclusive to
our New England community.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.966
Together we could create
a whole line

02:55.966 --> 02:58.549
of home products for
our target market.

02:58.549 --> 03:01.257
Sauce pans, sheets,
dish towels...

03:01.257 --> 03:02.340
You hear that?

03:02.340 --> 03:03.674
A full line.

03:03.674 --> 03:07.382
Your face, your name, in stores
all through the north east.

03:07.382 --> 03:09.174
Abby Porter is New England.

03:09.174 --> 03:11.049
You see, it is that kind
of honesty

03:11.049 --> 03:12.799
that our customers
will relate to.

03:12.799 --> 03:14.757
Mr. Carrington,
I'm actually from-

03:14.757 --> 03:17.341
So where do we go from here?

03:17.341 --> 03:19.341
Well, my board and I will be
looking closely

03:19.341 --> 03:21.841
at your upcoming webisodes
so make them personal

03:21.841 --> 03:22.675
because it's like I say,

03:22.675 --> 03:24.591
if we go into business together

03:24.591 --> 03:25.966
people aren't buying
your product,

03:25.966 --> 03:28.758
they're buying you, Abby.

03:28.758 --> 03:30.174
Me?

03:30.174 --> 03:32.425
From New England?

03:38.967 --> 03:41.175
But you're not from New England.

03:41.175 --> 03:42.092
Now, of course.

03:42.092 --> 03:43.883
But not originally.

03:43.883 --> 03:45.050
I know that, mom.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.675
Mr. Carrington doesn't.

03:47.675 --> 03:48.842
Are there more albums?

03:48.842 --> 03:50.592
No, that's everything
I could find.

03:50.592 --> 03:53.050
And most of the photos of you
as a child

03:53.050 --> 03:57.008
have a cactus or a longhorn
cattle in them.

03:57.008 --> 03:59.467
I was hoping there might be
one of a lighthouse

03:59.467 --> 04:00.718
or a lobster boat,

04:00.718 --> 04:04.009
something I might be able
to Photoshop myself into.

04:04.009 --> 04:05.384
I know this timing is terrible

04:05.384 --> 04:09.634
but I got a phone call earlier
from Janet Miller's mother.

04:09.634 --> 04:11.009
Do you remember Janet?

04:11.009 --> 04:13.884
Yeah, we were cheerleaders
together at Langston.

04:13.884 --> 04:14.968
Sure.

04:14.968 --> 04:15.926
Well, she wanted us to know
that your father

04:15.926 --> 04:18.093
fell off his horse yesterday.

04:18.093 --> 04:19.009
Oh no!

04:19.009 --> 04:19.926
Is he ok?

04:19.926 --> 04:20.759
Oh no, he's fine.

04:20.759 --> 04:21.759
He just hurt his shoulder,

04:21.759 --> 04:23.635
but he's gonna have
to take it easy

04:23.635 --> 04:26.343
for the next week or two
and uh,

04:26.343 --> 04:27.635
you know your father.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.510
Right. That is not
going to happen.

04:30.510 --> 04:33.343
Is there any chance that you
might be able to fly out

04:33.343 --> 04:36.635
and help him for
maybe a week or two?

04:36.635 --> 04:37.927
Uh...Mom.

04:37.927 --> 04:41.844
It can be so awkward
between me and dad.

04:41.844 --> 04:43.677
What makes you think he even
wants me there?

04:43.677 --> 04:45.177
You know he loves you.

04:45.177 --> 04:47.136
But nothing I do pleases him.

04:47.136 --> 04:49.511
He finds some fault
in everything.

04:49.511 --> 04:50.969
Oh, I think that's
just in your head.

04:50.969 --> 04:55.177
But if you believe that
look at it like

04:55.177 --> 05:00.219
a chance to mend fences.

05:00.219 --> 05:03.594
Can you go?

05:03.594 --> 05:06.053
If he needs me,
you know I'm there.

05:06.053 --> 05:08.636
That's my Texas girl.

05:08.636 --> 05:10.803
If only I was your
New England girl.

05:10.803 --> 05:13.095
Oh, you know I might have
a few more photo albums

05:13.095 --> 05:15.511
in the guest bedroom closet.

05:15.511 --> 05:16.220
I'll go look.

05:16.220 --> 05:26.303
Ok.

05:26.303 --> 05:27.220
Hello?

05:27.220 --> 05:28.886
Gina.

05:28.886 --> 05:30.721
We need to talk.

05:33.303 --> 05:36.429
[cows mooing]

06:08.013 --> 06:10.722
Well, Texas, I'm back.

06:10.722 --> 06:13.596
I hope we're both ready
for this.

06:25.013 --> 06:29.055
[cows mooing]

06:45.014 --> 06:48.764
Abby, that's you already.

06:48.764 --> 06:49.806
Hey, Dad.

06:49.806 --> 06:52.306
I didn't expect you
until suppertime.

06:56.265 --> 06:57.306
Howdy.

06:59.598 --> 07:00.889
You didn't have
to drop everything

07:00.889 --> 07:01.848
and come all this way.

07:01.848 --> 07:03.306
I'll be good as new in no time.

07:03.306 --> 07:05.682
I heard a few weeks.

07:05.682 --> 07:08.265
What's a few weeks?

07:08.265 --> 07:10.056
Come on, let's get your bags.

07:10.056 --> 07:11.015
Ok.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.515
Ok.

07:20.515 --> 07:23.932
So, how's your mama doing
these days?

07:23.932 --> 07:27.057
She's off to a wedding
in London.

07:27.057 --> 07:29.433
London.

07:29.433 --> 07:31.765
What a crazy pair we made.

07:31.765 --> 07:35.849
You know, they don't build towns
big enough for her.

07:35.849 --> 07:38.516
Or small enough for me.

07:38.516 --> 07:40.516
It's like you, I guess.

07:40.516 --> 07:43.141
You're definitely
your mama's daughter.

07:43.141 --> 07:45.891
I'm your daughter, too, Dad.

07:45.891 --> 07:47.474
I miss you.

07:47.474 --> 07:48.558
Yes.

07:48.558 --> 07:50.516
I've just been so busy
with my new web series.

07:50.516 --> 07:51.808
You got your own life.

07:51.808 --> 07:55.516
I get that, yeah.

07:55.516 --> 07:58.475
Have you seen my show?

08:01.475 --> 08:04.225
I- I look in on it.

08:04.225 --> 08:10.100
I saw one, it was entirely
on blenders.

08:10.100 --> 08:14.016
I tell you one thing, you
don't do anything halfway.

08:14.016 --> 08:16.350
Exactly.

08:16.350 --> 08:18.517
So, tell me what needs doing
around here

08:18.517 --> 08:20.642
and consider it done.

08:20.642 --> 08:23.059
Dressed like that?

08:23.059 --> 08:24.642
[chuckles]
I don't think so.

08:24.642 --> 08:25.892
Well, this was
just for the plane.

08:25.892 --> 08:27.684
I brought plenty of clothes.

08:27.684 --> 08:28.934
No really, it's ok.

08:28.934 --> 08:32.183
I hired a new ranch manager
a few weeks back.

08:32.183 --> 08:33.101
He's good.

08:33.101 --> 08:34.892
Gets most everything done.

08:34.892 --> 08:39.308
At least until I can get out
of this contraption.

08:39.308 --> 08:40.727
I'm here to pick up the slack,

08:40.727 --> 08:45.101
so whatever he can't do
you can count on me.

08:48.643 --> 08:51.018
Speak of the devil.

08:51.018 --> 08:52.768
New manager?

08:54.351 --> 08:56.227
New to some.

08:56.227 --> 08:59.852
Maybe not so much to you.

08:59.852 --> 09:01.893
Someone I know?

09:02.810 --> 09:03.519
Dad?

09:03.519 --> 09:04.935
[chuckles]

09:04.935 --> 09:07.519
Dad?

09:07.519 --> 09:09.644
Dad, who is it?

09:22.811 --> 09:24.352
Well, well, well.

09:24.352 --> 09:25.394
Ryan.

09:25.394 --> 09:27.936
Look who's back home
on the range.

09:27.936 --> 09:29.894
Abby.

09:29.894 --> 09:32.686
What a surprise.

09:32.686 --> 09:34.353
So your dad didn't tell you?

09:34.353 --> 09:35.686
Just about to.

09:35.686 --> 09:36.769
Hmm.

09:36.769 --> 09:40.478
How 'bout I give you two
a chance to catch up?

09:40.478 --> 09:43.270
Well, he didn't tell me
you were comin', either.

09:43.270 --> 09:45.437
Well, how could I stay away?

09:45.437 --> 09:46.895
After his accident and all,

09:46.895 --> 09:49.520
so he needs an extra hand
and I'm here to help out.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.603
[laughs]

09:50.603 --> 09:51.603
What?

09:51.603 --> 09:52.645
Oh boy.

09:53.687 --> 09:56.187
You're here to help out?

09:56.187 --> 10:00.520
For as long as I can be
helpful, yes.

10:00.520 --> 10:04.438
Ok, so a short visit, then?

10:04.438 --> 10:08.229
What's so funny?

10:08.229 --> 10:10.729
Look, don't get me wrong,
you look...

10:10.729 --> 10:15.354
you look great, but uh, you're
dressed for a garden party.

10:15.354 --> 10:17.771
Well, I just got here.

10:17.771 --> 10:21.604
I haven't had a chance
to change yet.

10:21.604 --> 10:24.229
Well, you've changed plenty
since high school.

10:24.229 --> 10:25.896
Not much, really.

10:25.896 --> 10:26.938
If you say so.

10:26.938 --> 10:28.354
Is this gonna be a problem?

10:28.354 --> 10:31.813
Us having to work together
for the next two weeks?

10:31.813 --> 10:33.855
Not for me.

10:33.855 --> 10:35.438
What happened between us
was years ago.

10:35.438 --> 10:37.855
I mean, who even remembers?

10:37.855 --> 10:39.771
Well, good.

10:39.771 --> 10:41.063
Good then.

10:41.063 --> 10:42.771
Well, if you're here to help
you can start right now.

10:42.771 --> 10:46.522
We gotta get all this stuff out
of the truck and into the barn.

10:46.522 --> 10:49.230
Uh, yeah. Ok.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.522
In a minute.

10:56.772 --> 11:00.106
You're stuck on that
yellow rose, ain't ya?

11:00.106 --> 11:03.106
No. I haven't seen these
in a while.

11:03.106 --> 11:04.273
Ooh, they're pretty.

11:04.273 --> 11:05.939
Did you plant these?

11:06.981 --> 11:09.189
[phone ringing]

11:09.189 --> 11:10.356
Gina?

11:10.356 --> 11:12.772
So I'm just off the phone
with Carrington.

11:12.772 --> 11:13.689
[sighs]

Always expecting the worst.

11:18.189 --> 11:19.356
Just tell me.

He wants a full bio on you
to pass on to his board.

11:21.189 --> 11:23.773
One that doesn't mention Texas,
I assume.

11:23.773 --> 11:25.690
Don't worry, I've got
this handled.

in Greenwich.

11:28.690 --> 11:31.857

we need to give him New England.

the truth a little.

feel good about this.

Well, my dad's being sweet
but... a little standoffish.

11:48.357 --> 11:51.482

she's more into

give it a minute.

we're tying up traffic.

Nah, that had nothing
to do with it.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.212

ranch management,

in ranch management.

it could go either way.

even heard of that.

Oh, well that's only
because my dad wanted me to.

34:13.565 --> 34:16.524

but I was hopeless.

34:16.524 --> 34:21.232
Well, you didn't wanna raise
livestock so much as dress them.

34:21.232 --> 34:24.940

my Dad proud.

34:24.940 --> 34:26.900

to connect with me

Maybe I can help you
change that.

to make extra money.

46:09.088 --> 46:10.880
How about selling it?

46:10.880 --> 46:12.505
Yeah, I'll hop right on that.

46:12.505 --> 46:14.172
No joke.

46:14.172 --> 46:15.797
You should think about it.

46:15.797 --> 46:18.088
There's no question the demand
is there.

46:18.088 --> 46:21.422
I don't even know
where to start.

46:21.422 --> 46:23.297
I can help.

46:23.297 --> 46:25.047
Ryan, that's what I do.

46:25.047 --> 46:28.506
I find new products
and promote them.

46:28.506 --> 46:30.255
You could make this a thing.

46:30.255 --> 46:31.714
A brand.

46:31.714 --> 46:34.672
You can make money off of this.

46:39.798 --> 46:41.006
Growing up

46:41.006 --> 46:43.380
I spent a lot of time right here
on this old family porch

46:43.380 --> 46:46.089
with family and friends,
curled up with a good book

46:46.089 --> 46:48.507
and a glass of mint lemonade.

46:48.507 --> 46:52.089
Yes, right here where I grew up.

46:52.089 --> 46:54.756
On the old family porch.

46:54.756 --> 46:57.256
In Greenwich, Connecticut.

46:57.256 --> 46:59.423
Can we- can we just take
a minute here?

46:59.423 --> 47:00.882
Are you not getting it?

47:00.882 --> 47:02.590
No, I'm getting it.

47:02.590 --> 47:04.256
I just don't get it.

47:04.256 --> 47:07.840
Do you really think someone's
gonna buy this is New England?

47:07.840 --> 47:12.715
Uh, if you come in close
and don't show too much, maybe.

47:12.715 --> 47:15.299
I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

47:15.299 --> 47:16.757
I have to give this guy
something

47:16.757 --> 47:20.216
so he can show
his executive board.

47:20.216 --> 47:22.132
Yeah, you don't give up easy,
that's for sure.

47:22.132 --> 47:25.132
I know I can be overly
ambitious.

47:25.132 --> 47:29.341
It gets me into trouble.

47:29.341 --> 47:31.257
Do you really think there's
something special

47:31.257 --> 47:32.633
in that barbecue sauce?

47:32.633 --> 47:35.591
Like, something commercial?

47:35.591 --> 47:37.424
You'll never know until you try.

47:37.424 --> 47:39.716
I could help.

47:39.716 --> 47:41.716
If you want, no pressure.

47:41.716 --> 47:46.217
I mean it.

47:52.716 --> 47:55.592
It's a bit obvious, isn't it?

47:55.592 --> 47:58.342
Well, you have to settle
on something.

47:58.342 --> 48:01.342
You need a label.

48:01.342 --> 48:05.509
What about a yellow rose?

48:05.509 --> 48:07.717
A yellow rose.

48:07.717 --> 48:09.759
That sure says Texas.

48:10.926 --> 48:11.884
Ryan?

48:11.884 --> 48:13.550
Abby?

48:13.550 --> 48:16.218
I hate to interrupt
your work there,

48:16.218 --> 48:19.218
but did you get
today's list done?

48:19.218 --> 48:20.467
Already ahead of you, Dad.

48:20.467 --> 48:22.134
The cows have been fed
and milked.

48:22.134 --> 48:23.592
And the herd's been moved
from the pasture.

48:23.592 --> 48:26.259
Well, that just leaves the west
gate that needs fixin'.

48:26.259 --> 48:30.134
And Ryan, I need you to bring
the tractor in from the pasture.

48:30.134 --> 48:31.259
Yes sir.

48:31.259 --> 48:31.926
Ok.

48:31.926 --> 48:32.760
I can do that.

48:32.760 --> 48:34.967
Dad, I can drive the tractor.

48:34.967 --> 48:37.259
You've been doing too much
around here lately

48:37.259 --> 48:39.676
and I appreciate it but...

48:39.676 --> 48:42.426
how about we get the gate
fixed, first.

48:42.426 --> 48:44.676
And then we can discuss it?

48:47.760 --> 48:49.551
Sure.

48:49.551 --> 48:51.426
Then we can discuss it.

48:55.469 --> 48:57.052
Did you hear that?

48:57.052 --> 48:58.760
He appreciates me.

48:58.760 --> 49:00.427
And we can discuss it.

49:00.427 --> 49:01.511
Two for two.

49:01.511 --> 49:02.636
(Both) Progress.

49:02.636 --> 49:04.302
[laughs]

49:13.385 --> 49:15.594
Yeah, keep holding it up for me.

49:17.761 --> 49:19.053
Do you think he meant that?

49:19.053 --> 49:21.594
That we can discuss me
driving the tractor?

49:21.594 --> 49:24.969
Well, I told you
we'd wear him down.

49:29.094 --> 49:31.011
Here's what I think.

49:31.011 --> 49:35.261
He loves this ranch and he
just wants you to love it, too.

49:35.261 --> 49:36.553
But I do.

49:36.553 --> 49:41.929
I always did, just... maybe
not the way he wanted me to.

49:41.929 --> 49:43.261
Give it a try.

49:44.261 --> 49:45.637
[squeaking]

49:45.637 --> 49:46.595
Nope.

49:46.595 --> 49:48.637
Not quite. Not quite.

49:51.095 --> 49:53.304
Let me try something.

49:53.304 --> 49:55.762
What? What're you doing?

49:55.762 --> 49:57.304
The lunch I packed.

49:58.221 --> 49:59.720
Caprese salad.

49:59.720 --> 50:00.929
Sounds delicious,

50:00.929 --> 50:02.720
but I don't see how a packed
lunch is gonna help us.

50:02.720 --> 50:05.304
Tomatoes, mozzarella, basil.

50:05.304 --> 50:06.346
And...

50:09.054 --> 50:11.137
Olive oil.

50:11.137 --> 50:13.596
You travel with your
own olive oil?

50:13.596 --> 50:14.763
Who does that?

50:14.763 --> 50:17.262
Someone who doesn't like
soggy tomatoes.

50:17.262 --> 50:19.471
I did a whole show
about that once.

50:19.471 --> 50:21.346
Ok.

50:31.138 --> 50:33.555
Alright.

50:36.597 --> 50:37.555
Ready?

50:37.555 --> 50:39.180
Alright.

50:40.055 --> 50:42.096
Ah, voila.

50:42.096 --> 50:42.806
[laughs]

50:42.806 --> 50:43.430
Ok, alright.

50:43.430 --> 50:44.930
-That's...
-Yep.

50:44.930 --> 50:46.180
That's a new one for me.

50:46.180 --> 50:48.388
That's my job and I love it.

50:48.388 --> 50:51.889
Helpful hacks for making
life easier.

50:51.889 --> 50:55.263
Ryan, I know your heart
is in Texas.

50:55.263 --> 50:57.597
Langston is beautiful.

50:57.597 --> 51:00.764
You know, part of my heart
is here, too,

51:00.764 --> 51:03.431
but... it's so quiet.

51:03.431 --> 51:07.264
Don't you ever feel
restless here?

51:07.264 --> 51:10.139
What, do you think there's
nothing to do around here?

51:10.139 --> 51:12.181
You might be surprised.

51:12.181 --> 51:13.431
Oh yeah?

51:13.431 --> 51:14.640
Surprise me.

51:14.640 --> 51:16.473
Ok, that sounds like
a challenge.

51:16.473 --> 51:19.223
It is.

51:19.223 --> 51:21.097
You remember the old
Garrett place?

51:21.097 --> 51:23.264
The old goat ranch?

51:23.264 --> 51:26.140
Sure, but I've seen it,
you know?

51:26.140 --> 51:30.640
Ah, you might find
it's been built up a bit.

51:30.640 --> 51:31.640
Come on.

51:31.640 --> 51:32.681
Ok.

51:45.808 --> 51:47.973
We specialize in
Cabernet Sauvignon

51:47.973 --> 51:53.599
but we have several popular
varietals these days.

51:53.599 --> 51:54.891
Carmen, I'm speechless.

51:54.891 --> 51:57.099
Which doesn't happen often.

51:57.099 --> 51:58.641
I remember you from school.

51:58.641 --> 51:59.933
You were a couple years
behind me

51:59.933 --> 52:02.766
but everyone knew
what a talker you were.

52:02.766 --> 52:04.933
And now here's the best part
of our tour.

52:04.933 --> 52:05.933
And what's that?

52:05.933 --> 52:07.933
The tasting.

52:10.724 --> 52:12.600
Over the past couple years
we've expanded to sales

52:12.600 --> 52:15.475
all across the state
and we just keep growing.

52:15.475 --> 52:16.767
You're amazing.

52:16.767 --> 52:19.308
Look who's talking,
Miss Internet Star.

52:19.308 --> 52:22.058
This is just my little home-spun
thing by comparison.

52:22.058 --> 52:23.225
Not at all.

52:23.225 --> 52:24.892
And that bottling room
in the back?

52:24.892 --> 52:26.059
Whew.

52:26.059 --> 52:27.475
Everything's done on premises.

52:27.475 --> 52:29.642
We keep our staff hopping,
that's for sure.

52:29.642 --> 52:31.391
I bet you could bottle all sorts
of things

52:31.391 --> 52:33.934
if someone needed to do that.

52:33.934 --> 52:35.100
Abby.

52:35.100 --> 52:38.100
What? I'm just saying.

52:38.100 --> 52:41.267
I hate to run but my buyers
from Austin have just pulled in.

52:41.267 --> 52:42.559
Welcome home, Abby,

52:42.559 --> 52:44.601
and I hope to see you both
at the fair this weekend.

52:44.601 --> 52:46.392
You will.

52:48.142 --> 52:52.726
You gotta admit, a lotta change
happening around here.

52:52.726 --> 52:54.309
Plenty of change.

52:54.309 --> 52:56.476
In fact, it's inspiring.

52:59.101 --> 53:01.267
Ryan, what's the big mystery?

53:01.267 --> 53:03.267
Hang on, we're almost there.

53:03.267 --> 53:05.601
Almost where?

53:05.601 --> 53:07.393
You gotta see this yourself.

53:07.393 --> 53:08.684
See what?

53:08.684 --> 53:09.851
Wait, is something wrong?

53:09.851 --> 53:11.935
Is it- is it Abby?

53:11.935 --> 53:13.726
Oh, it's Abby.

53:15.268 --> 53:20.101
[tractor engine running]

53:21.727 --> 53:22.727
Huh.

53:26.560 --> 53:28.602
Like a pro.

53:29.852 --> 53:32.144
Hey Dad!

53:32.144 --> 53:35.228
[laughs]

53:39.727 --> 53:41.727
Well I'll be.

54:01.394 --> 54:02.895
[knocking]

54:04.020 --> 54:05.103
Hey Dad.

54:05.103 --> 54:06.686
Did you need something.

54:06.686 --> 54:13.187
Just to tell you...
good work today.

54:13.187 --> 54:14.770
Not half bad.

54:14.770 --> 54:16.937
No, better.

54:16.937 --> 54:20.437
Not bad at all.

54:20.437 --> 54:22.354
You get some rest now.

54:22.354 --> 54:24.103
You too, Dad.

54:24.103 --> 54:25.771
Thanks, sweetie.

54:30.270 --> 54:33.854
[cows mooing]

54:36.562 --> 54:38.230
Smells like barbecue.

54:38.230 --> 54:40.230
Looks like barbecue.

54:40.230 --> 54:41.395
I appreciate the interest y'all,

54:41.395 --> 54:43.271
but could you give me
a little stirring space?

54:43.271 --> 54:44.521
A little elbow room?

54:44.521 --> 54:46.438
Yeah. Absolutely.

54:46.438 --> 54:49.271
Uh, you really think this old
recipe might be worth something?

54:49.271 --> 54:51.729
We'll put a few bottles out
for sale at the fair tonight

54:51.729 --> 54:53.605
and see what happens.

54:53.605 --> 54:56.772
I mean, if we like the reaction
then I'll call my publicist,

54:56.772 --> 54:58.938
see if we can get it
on a national market.

54:58.938 --> 55:00.730
Oh, that's awful ambitious.

55:00.730 --> 55:02.188
Abby's got me thinkin' big.

55:02.188 --> 55:03.355
Careful, Ryan.

55:03.355 --> 55:06.897
Next she'll have you packin' up
and movin' east.

55:06.897 --> 55:08.814
You gotta tell me
what you think, Wes.

55:08.814 --> 55:10.522
Honest opinion.

55:12.605 --> 55:13.730
Mmm.

55:13.730 --> 55:16.105
Like a mouthful of Texas.

55:16.105 --> 55:17.439
That's good!

55:17.439 --> 55:19.105
We could use that
in the advertising.

55:19.105 --> 55:20.147
What advertising?

55:20.147 --> 55:22.688
Oh, I might be jumping
the gun a little,

55:22.688 --> 55:25.689
again, but that's
a good line, Dad.

55:25.689 --> 55:28.648
You're a natural at sales.

55:28.648 --> 55:29.939
Maybe.

55:29.939 --> 55:32.773
But for now I should- I should
probably stick to ranchin'.

55:32.773 --> 55:36.147
[chickens clucking]

55:36.147 --> 55:37.773
What's going on out there?

55:37.773 --> 55:38.731
You need a hand?

55:38.731 --> 55:41.564
Nothing I can't handle.
Hey...

55:41.564 --> 55:43.106
Well, when you're finished
with this,

55:43.106 --> 55:45.106
Carmen said that she'd loan us
her packing room

55:45.106 --> 55:46.564
for our first run.

55:46.564 --> 55:47.856
A few hundred bottles.

55:47.856 --> 55:49.315
How much is this costing us?

55:49.315 --> 55:50.940
Well, the labels are
from my laptop

55:50.940 --> 55:53.731
and the bottles only cost
a few cents a piece.

55:53.731 --> 55:57.273
As far as start-up goes
this is pocket change.

55:57.273 --> 56:01.023
[phone rings]

56:01.023 --> 56:03.899
Oh, it's my manager.

56:06.232 --> 56:07.440
Um... hey!

56:07.440 --> 56:08.732
Abby, hi!

56:08.732 --> 56:11.690
Mr. Carrington's here and
he'd like to speak with you.

56:11.690 --> 56:15.274
Video call so he can see you.

56:15.274 --> 56:16.899
In Greenwich.

56:16.899 --> 56:20.149
Here, in Greenwich.

56:20.149 --> 56:23.483
Um... any way
we can postpone?

56:23.483 --> 56:26.732
Like I said he's right here.

56:29.441 --> 56:30.274
Oh, Abby! Abby!

56:30.274 --> 56:32.107
Apron.

56:36.274 --> 56:37.775
Hey, Mr. Carrington!

56:37.775 --> 56:39.025
How are you?

56:39.025 --> 56:40.025
Good.

56:40.025 --> 56:42.025
Uh, hope I'm not intruding
on family time.

56:42.025 --> 56:45.733
I'm picturing cocktails
by the water?

56:45.733 --> 56:46.942
That's a good guess.

56:46.942 --> 56:53.775
Just back from a whole day
of uh... croquet.

56:53.775 --> 56:56.400
Just about to mix up a pitcher
of Cape Cods.

56:56.400 --> 56:57.691
Croquet and Cape Cods.

56:57.691 --> 56:59.192
Does it get any more authentic
than that?

56:59.192 --> 57:02.775
See, this is why we are excited
about you.

57:02.775 --> 57:05.067
So I like the piece you did
on the porch,

57:05.067 --> 57:07.275
but all we saw was the porch.

57:07.275 --> 57:10.150
Um, we need more
Connecticut scenery.

57:10.150 --> 57:11.943
More local colour.

57:11.943 --> 57:13.317
More scope.

57:13.317 --> 57:15.359
(Wes) Abby, there's chickens
all over the place!

57:15.359 --> 57:18.193
Didn't you check the pen
this mornin'?

01:08:07.129 --> 01:08:08.171
How soon?

01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:11.463
In a language you'll understand
these days?

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:12.796
Pronto.

01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:22.964
Is Ryan coming in today?

01:08:22.964 --> 01:08:24.129
Well, he should be.

01:08:24.129 --> 01:08:25.130
I haven't heard from him yet.

01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:26.255
Is something wrong?

01:08:26.255 --> 01:08:28.964
Gina needs me in Connecticut.

01:08:28.964 --> 01:08:31.130
Ryan needs me here.

01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:34.046
Everybody needs ya.

01:08:34.046 --> 01:08:36.130
Not everybody.

01:08:37.464 --> 01:08:38.964
Why would you say that?

01:08:38.964 --> 01:08:43.421
Because everything is coming
apart and I'm just confused

01:08:43.421 --> 01:08:46.296
and I don't even know
what to say.

01:08:46.296 --> 01:08:47.589
Honey.

01:08:47.589 --> 01:08:52.714
Everything I've ever done
I did to make you proud, Dad.

01:08:52.714 --> 01:08:56.421
Somehow it's never been enough.

01:08:56.421 --> 01:09:00.048
Is that what you really think?

01:09:00.048 --> 01:09:05.840
I mean... all these years?

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.381
Let me show you somethin'.

01:09:08.381 --> 01:09:09.840
Come on.

01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:35.799
All these old photos?

01:09:35.799 --> 01:09:40.466
You think I don't
appreciate you?

01:09:40.466 --> 01:09:41.756
Abby.

01:09:41.756 --> 01:09:47.131
You- you came all this way
to help out even though I know

01:09:47.131 --> 01:09:50.216
you're not much happier here
than your mama was.

01:09:50.216 --> 01:09:52.133
What do you mean?

01:09:52.133 --> 01:09:55.049
When we married I asked
your mama to move here

01:09:55.049 --> 01:09:57.174
hoping she'd take to ranchin'.

01:09:57.174 --> 01:10:00.341
Just like I hoped
you would, too.

01:10:03.716 --> 01:10:05.967
But you are your own person,
you see?

01:10:05.967 --> 01:10:08.424
And I saw that.

01:10:08.424 --> 01:10:11.758
I always thought you were
disappointed in me.

01:10:11.758 --> 01:10:12.633
Oh, no.

01:10:12.633 --> 01:10:14.883
I mean it was clear
from the start

01:10:14.883 --> 01:10:17.967
you were never gonna be
a rancher.

01:10:17.967 --> 01:10:21.342
But honey, if you thought
for one second

01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:24.801
I was ever disappointed
in you...

01:10:24.801 --> 01:10:28.843
well, we got ourselves a
Texas-sized misunderstanding

01:10:28.843 --> 01:10:30.051
on our hands.

01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:32.634
It's my fault, 'cause I had
never been, you know,

01:10:32.634 --> 01:10:36.134
the... the kind of fella
who could, you know,

01:10:36.134 --> 01:10:41.009
talk about his feelin's
and such.

01:10:41.009 --> 01:10:43.218
I need to show you this.

01:10:58.093 --> 01:11:01.093
All these old photos.

01:11:01.093 --> 01:11:02.593
All these clippings.

01:11:02.593 --> 01:11:03.802
Yeah.

01:11:03.802 --> 01:11:04.969
Even I haven't seen
some of these.

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:06.927
I've been keepin' 'em
for years.

01:11:06.927 --> 01:11:11.302
Showing them off to anyone
who would listen.

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:20.302
Honey, I have always been
so very, very proud of you.

01:11:20.969 --> 01:11:22.302
You have?

01:11:22.302 --> 01:11:23.344
Sure.

01:11:23.344 --> 01:11:26.678
You were cut out for big things
in this world.

01:11:26.678 --> 01:11:30.636
When you were a little girl
you took after your mama.

01:11:30.636 --> 01:11:32.261
You decorated your room like-

01:11:32.261 --> 01:11:35.594
like it was a palace and then
you dressed like a princess.

01:11:35.594 --> 01:11:40.136
You see, that you got
from your mama.

01:11:40.136 --> 01:11:43.636
But you're stubborn,
like me.

01:11:43.636 --> 01:11:44.845
Ambitious, too.

01:11:44.845 --> 01:11:48.136
You go after what you want.

01:11:48.136 --> 01:11:52.387
Darlin', you're a combination
of your mama and me

01:11:52.387 --> 01:11:58.262
and as far as I'm concerned
that makes you perfect.

01:11:58.262 --> 01:12:01.303
I love you so very much, honey.

01:12:01.303 --> 01:12:04.136
I love you, too, Dad.

01:12:12.846 --> 01:12:14.137
[cows mooing]

01:12:14.137 --> 01:12:16.263
Wes said you needed to see me.

01:12:20.762 --> 01:12:23.929
Everything is falling apart
back east.

01:12:23.929 --> 01:12:26.804
I have to go home and pull it
all back together.

01:12:26.804 --> 01:12:29.596
So you're leavin'.

01:12:29.596 --> 01:12:33.012
Tomorrow morning.

01:12:33.012 --> 01:12:36.013
We both knew I had to
eventually.

01:12:36.013 --> 01:12:37.429
At first, sure.

01:12:37.429 --> 01:12:42.139
But, I don't know,
I thought we were...

01:12:42.139 --> 01:12:45.471
We were what?

01:12:45.471 --> 01:12:46.721
I don't know.

01:12:46.721 --> 01:12:48.805
For some reason I thought
we had a new understanding.

01:12:48.805 --> 01:12:51.139
This is my job, Ryan.

01:12:51.139 --> 01:12:52.430
This is my life.

01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:53.721
And that life isn't here.

01:12:53.721 --> 01:12:55.805
Got it. Yeah.

01:12:55.805 --> 01:12:58.264
This is the same conversation
we had years ago.

01:12:58.264 --> 01:13:00.389
What am I supposed to do?

01:13:00.389 --> 01:13:04.347
I have to get back there
as soon as I can.

01:13:04.347 --> 01:13:06.931
What do you want?

01:13:09.389 --> 01:13:14.014
Honestly, I'm not
even sure anymore.

01:13:14.014 --> 01:13:16.389
Well, that's too bad.

01:13:16.389 --> 01:13:18.639
Because I'm very sure of us

01:13:18.639 --> 01:13:21.098
and I was hopin' you were, too.

01:13:21.098 --> 01:13:23.556
Sure of me, at least.

01:13:23.556 --> 01:13:27.473
I'm in a really tough position.

01:13:27.473 --> 01:13:28.473
I don't have a choice.

01:13:28.473 --> 01:13:30.682
You always have a choice, Abby.

01:13:30.682 --> 01:13:34.723
You just have to have
the courage to make it.

01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:41.765
Me, I've decided to sell
the house.

01:13:42.557 --> 01:13:44.473
The offer was too good
to pass up.

01:13:44.473 --> 01:13:48.057
It was more than I was asking,
thanks to you.

01:13:48.057 --> 01:13:53.807
Ralph's bringing the papers
by tomorrow.

01:13:53.807 --> 01:13:55.140
I can finally make
that down payment

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.849
on some land outside of town.

01:13:57.849 --> 01:14:00.349
I'll be just fine.

01:14:00.349 --> 01:14:02.890
That's something
I never doubted.

01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:04.849
So this is it.

01:14:04.849 --> 01:14:07.558
Well, we had a good run.

01:14:07.558 --> 01:14:11.558
Twice.

01:14:11.558 --> 01:14:13.266
Like the first time,

01:14:13.266 --> 01:14:17.016
I wish you nothing but
the best in the world.

01:14:26.641 --> 01:14:28.141
We can't leave it this way!

01:14:28.141 --> 01:14:30.225
Sure we can.

01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:37.100
Truth is I should have moved on
a long time ago

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:38.475
and I truly thought I had.

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:41.058
But these last couple weeks
I let my guard down

01:14:41.058 --> 01:14:43.183
and I fell in love with you
all over again.

01:14:43.183 --> 01:14:45.517
Nope.

01:14:45.517 --> 01:14:48.308
That's not it.

01:14:48.308 --> 01:14:51.267
I never stopped loving you.

01:14:52.475 --> 01:14:53.851
Ryan.

01:14:53.851 --> 01:14:55.517
Goodbye, Abby.

01:14:55.517 --> 01:14:57.934
[starts engine]

01:15:10.017 --> 01:15:11.726
You've reached Gina Mosley
Productions.

01:15:11.726 --> 01:15:15.351
Leave a message and
I'll get back to you.

01:15:15.351 --> 01:15:16.309
[beep]

01:15:16.309 --> 01:15:17.977
Gina, I've been trying
to reach you.

01:15:17.977 --> 01:15:19.560
Where are you?

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.226
Call me.

01:15:26.434 --> 01:15:29.143
I hate to see you go, Abby.

01:15:29.143 --> 01:15:31.060
Me too, Dad.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.352
But I have to.

01:15:32.352 --> 01:15:34.561
How'd you leave things
with Ryan?

01:15:34.561 --> 01:15:36.018
Not good.

01:15:37.602 --> 01:15:41.602
I thought you two had
a real chance this time.

01:15:41.602 --> 01:15:43.811
My show's in New England.

01:15:43.811 --> 01:15:47.185
I thought the internet
was everywhere these days.

01:15:47.185 --> 01:15:53.310
It is, but New England
is only in New England.

01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:55.310
I'm gonna miss you.

01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:57.769
I'm gonna miss you, too,
honey.

01:16:01.353 --> 01:16:02.395
[car approaching]

01:16:02.395 --> 01:16:04.144
Hmm.

01:16:04.144 --> 01:16:06.270
Looks like we have a visitor.

01:16:13.144 --> 01:16:14.311
Jacob?

01:16:14.311 --> 01:16:16.311
What in the world...

01:16:16.311 --> 01:16:18.061
It's not just me.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.979
So, this is Texas.

01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:27.062
Is this why I couldn't reach you
at the studio?

01:16:28.812 --> 01:16:30.478
Mr. Carrington.

01:16:30.478 --> 01:16:32.979
Hi, Abby.

01:16:32.979 --> 01:16:34.728
I'm so confused.

01:16:34.728 --> 01:16:36.895
I told you he loved
the Yellow Rose.

01:16:36.895 --> 01:16:38.145
And I do.

01:16:38.145 --> 01:16:39.979
And, ok, he was a
little disappointed

01:16:39.979 --> 01:16:43.396
you weren't as authentically
New England as you'd let on-

01:16:43.396 --> 01:16:46.020
Gina.

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:49.312
As... I let on.

01:16:49.312 --> 01:16:50.604
My bad, I admit it.

01:16:50.604 --> 01:16:52.521
I'm a terrible person.

01:16:52.521 --> 01:16:54.563
But I still like your style.

01:16:54.563 --> 01:16:56.479
And I think you have
a wealth of knowledge

01:16:56.479 --> 01:16:58.396
and I would hate to see
that go to waste.

01:16:58.396 --> 01:17:00.479
Your Taste of Texas idea?

01:17:00.479 --> 01:17:01.563
He loves it.

01:17:01.563 --> 01:17:03.396
He wants to expand his company.

01:17:03.396 --> 01:17:04.813
We're always looking
for the chance

01:17:04.813 --> 01:17:08.980
to take our brand national
if it's authentic.

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:11.230
Oh, it's authentic.

01:17:11.230 --> 01:17:13.605
This is where I come from.

01:17:13.605 --> 01:17:16.313
These are my roots.

01:17:16.313 --> 01:17:18.105
My real roots.

01:17:18.105 --> 01:17:22.105
This is my barn, my cows,
my chickens...

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:24.772
and this is my dad.

01:17:24.772 --> 01:17:26.939
Wes Porter.

01:17:26.939 --> 01:17:28.313
Howdy.

01:17:28.313 --> 01:17:31.480
You the fellow who's been givin'
my little girl all the trouble?

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.480
Well, I think it's the other
way around,

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:35.231
but uh, I'm not here to argue.

01:17:35.231 --> 01:17:36.147
[laughs]

01:17:36.147 --> 01:17:37.856
Fair enough.

01:17:37.856 --> 01:17:40.897
We could have done
all of this on the phone.

01:17:40.897 --> 01:17:42.981
What're you guys doing here?

01:17:42.981 --> 01:17:44.689
We're here to shoot the pilot.

01:17:44.689 --> 01:17:48.022
Jacob's got the equipment
and you've got the location.

01:17:48.022 --> 01:17:49.398
And I've got the money.

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:52.565
Oh, don't you just love
the sound of that?

01:17:52.565 --> 01:17:54.815
Jacob, go find some
good angles.

01:17:54.815 --> 01:17:55.815
Think scope.

01:17:55.815 --> 01:17:57.523
Right, Mr. Carrington?

01:17:57.523 --> 01:18:00.648
We want scope.

01:18:00.648 --> 01:18:01.648
Well, what're you waiting for?

01:18:01.648 --> 01:18:03.565
Go change!

01:18:07.148 --> 01:18:08.232
I love this.

01:18:08.232 --> 01:18:09.399
-This is fantastic.
-It's perfect, isn't it?

01:18:09.399 --> 01:18:10.357
The lot.

01:18:10.357 --> 01:18:11.606
This is exactly what
we're looking for.

01:18:12.815 --> 01:18:14.731
Scope.

01:18:14.731 --> 01:18:16.566
And action!

01:18:17.524 --> 01:18:18.982
Don't adjust your screens.

01:18:18.982 --> 01:18:20.982
"New England My Way" is moving.

01:18:20.982 --> 01:18:23.816
We're live streaming today
all the way from my home town,

01:18:23.816 --> 01:18:25.816
Langston, Texas.

01:18:25.816 --> 01:18:28.399
This is where I was
born and raised.

01:18:28.399 --> 01:18:30.816
This is the land
that I know best.

01:18:30.816 --> 01:18:32.774
Better than the beaches
of Cape Cod

01:18:32.774 --> 01:18:35.274
or the maple forests of Vermont.

01:18:36.024 --> 01:18:37.191
[ringing]

01:18:37.191 --> 01:18:39.983
And together we're going
to explore it all.

01:18:39.983 --> 01:18:43.441
[phone ringing]

01:18:43.441 --> 01:18:44.607
Hey, hello.

01:18:44.607 --> 01:18:45.483
Ryan?

01:18:45.483 --> 01:18:47.108
It's Janet Miller.

01:18:47.108 --> 01:18:49.358
There's something
you need to see.

01:18:49.358 --> 01:18:50.483
Ok, uh yeah.

01:18:50.483 --> 01:18:51.899
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

01:18:51.899 --> 01:18:52.983
Just need your signature
on these pages

01:18:52.983 --> 01:18:54.149
and we'll get things rollin'.

01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.899
Yeah.

01:18:54.899 --> 01:18:55.900
Can I call you back?

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:56.983
You could but it might be
too late.

01:18:56.983 --> 01:18:58.733
Are you near your computer?

01:18:59.233 --> 01:19:01.608
A friend reminded me recently
just how amazing

01:19:01.608 --> 01:19:03.525
this part of the country is.

01:19:03.525 --> 01:19:05.150
How much it has to offer.

01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:09.276
Well, it turns out my heart
is here in more ways than one,

01:19:09.276 --> 01:19:11.650
and sometimes you just have
to follow it.

01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:14.317
The sky goes on forever here.

01:19:14.317 --> 01:19:18.692
The air is filled with the smell
of wild flowers and sage brush.

01:19:18.692 --> 01:19:20.484
There's just nothing like it.

01:19:20.484 --> 01:19:22.276
That's Abby Porter,
isn't it?

01:19:22.276 --> 01:19:23.651
What's she talking about,
her heart?

01:19:23.651 --> 01:19:25.276
I don't know but I need
to find out.

01:19:25.276 --> 01:19:27.192
It got me so excited
that I wanted to share it

01:19:27.192 --> 01:19:28.651
with all of you.

01:19:28.651 --> 01:19:30.609
So it's time to
get reacquainted,

01:19:30.609 --> 01:19:32.693
and in my mind there's
no better way to do that

01:19:32.693 --> 01:19:34.442
than over barbecue.

01:19:34.442 --> 01:19:36.609
Ribs and lobster.

01:19:36.609 --> 01:19:38.484
New England, meet Texas.

01:19:38.484 --> 01:19:40.985
Texas surf 'n' turf.

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:41.693
Woah, Ryan.

01:19:41.693 --> 01:19:43.068
The contract.

01:19:43.068 --> 01:19:45.484
Just leave it on the table and
lock up when you're done, ok?

01:19:47.527 --> 01:19:49.151
And we're out.

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:50.569
That was brilliant.

01:19:50.569 --> 01:19:53.776
So easy, so natural, and that
sauce is a product I can sell.

01:19:53.776 --> 01:19:55.985
So do we have a deal?

01:19:55.985 --> 01:19:58.652
As long as we agree to
all be entirely truthful

01:19:58.652 --> 01:20:00.318
from this point on.

01:20:00.318 --> 01:20:02.402
Cross my Texas heart.

01:20:02.944 --> 01:20:06.069
I didn't tell you that
my grandfather was
from Texas, did I?

01:20:06.069 --> 01:20:07.277
No.

01:20:07.277 --> 01:20:10.318
He's not, I just wanted to make
sure I didn't say it.

01:20:10.318 --> 01:20:12.485
I think we both better keep
our eye on this one.

01:20:12.485 --> 01:20:13.485
[laughs]

01:20:13.485 --> 01:20:14.819
This lemonade is terrific,
by the way.

01:20:14.819 --> 01:20:15.652
Mmm.

01:20:15.652 --> 01:20:17.236
It's bottled just
down the road.

01:20:17.236 --> 01:20:19.486
Fresh local lemons.

01:20:19.486 --> 01:20:21.361
Might make a show on its own,
you think?

01:20:21.361 --> 01:20:23.819
That I will leave up
to your daughter.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.528
Yeah, smart man.

01:20:26.777 --> 01:20:28.069
[truck approaching]

01:20:28.069 --> 01:20:30.986
(Wes) We haven't had this much
traffic here in years.

01:20:46.570 --> 01:20:48.695
Uh, can we- can
we talk a minute?

01:20:59.153 --> 01:21:01.696
Is that the old boyfriend?

01:21:01.696 --> 01:21:03.529
Yep.

01:21:03.529 --> 01:21:05.946
And I'm hoping the new one.

01:21:08.946 --> 01:21:12.487
I uh, I was watching your show
just now,

01:21:12.487 --> 01:21:14.071
Yellow Rose and all.

01:21:14.071 --> 01:21:15.487
What's going on?

01:21:15.487 --> 01:21:16.946
My plans changed.

01:21:16.946 --> 01:21:18.904
I'm not going anywhere.

01:21:18.904 --> 01:21:20.654
What about New England your way?

01:21:20.654 --> 01:21:21.988
[laughs]

01:21:21.988 --> 01:21:25.696
The great thing about a website
is you can run it from anywhere.

01:21:25.696 --> 01:21:28.321
My dad reminded me of that.

01:21:28.321 --> 01:21:30.113
So the deal's off?

01:21:30.113 --> 01:21:31.655
No, it's on.

01:21:31.655 --> 01:21:33.321
And better than ever.

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:34.864
We're re-branding.

01:21:34.864 --> 01:21:36.530
A Taste of Texas.

01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:38.989
And we'll shoot it right here
in Langston.

01:21:38.989 --> 01:21:40.238
So you're staying?

01:21:40.238 --> 01:21:41.572
Yes.

01:21:41.572 --> 01:21:44.280
And Yellow Rose is the first
product we're promoting,

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.197
so I hope you haven't signed
the papers on the house yet.

01:21:47.197 --> 01:21:50.239
Not yet.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:53.364
I don't wanna make promises
I can't keep,

01:21:53.364 --> 01:21:57.155
but with time this could
amount to something.

01:21:57.155 --> 01:22:01.030
Maybe even buy that land
across the road.

01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:02.447
But I have one more idea.

01:22:02.447 --> 01:22:05.155
Oh no, should I-
should I duck?

01:22:06.447 --> 01:22:09.072
What if your ranch
was more than a ranch?

01:22:09.072 --> 01:22:12.155
What if it was a destination?

01:22:12.155 --> 01:22:14.155
A guest ranch where people
from all over

01:22:14.155 --> 01:22:16.364
can come and see all
the wonderful things

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:19.364
that you and I love about
this place.

01:22:19.364 --> 01:22:21.823
The old west meets
the new east.

01:22:21.823 --> 01:22:24.282
What do you think?

01:22:24.282 --> 01:22:26.490
I think I'd need
a great designer.

01:22:26.490 --> 01:22:27.407
Hmm.

01:22:27.407 --> 01:22:31.198
Lucky for you I happen
to know someone.

01:22:31.198 --> 01:22:33.240
Lucky for me.

01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:42.365
Now this feels like home.
