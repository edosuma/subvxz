WEBVTT

00:08.167 --> 00:15.335
â™ª

00:15.335 --> 00:16.210
(Director) You ready, Abby?

00:16.210 --> 00:17.168
(Abby) Yeah.

00:17.168 --> 00:18.252
(Director) And action!

00:19.544 --> 00:21.877
How many of you know that the
traditional New England clambake

00:21.877 --> 00:25.086
began with Native
American tribes?

00:25.086 --> 00:26.961
Years before the Europeans
got here

00:26.961 --> 00:29.669
they were cooking their
lobsters, corn and mussels

00:29.669 --> 00:32.461
in sand pits along
the beach.

00:32.461 --> 00:35.336
Of course, they were using beach
stones to retain the heat

00:35.336 --> 00:37.044
and it took all day.

00:37.044 --> 00:38.712
But if you haven't got
that kind of time

00:38.712 --> 00:40.794
and you can't make it
to the beach

00:40.794 --> 00:43.837
then this is an excellent way
to bring the beach to you.

00:43.837 --> 00:46.002
Well, she certainly knows
her stuff.

00:46.002 --> 00:49.628
That's why her followers have
doubled in the past six months.

00:49.628 --> 00:53.170
As always, the table setting is
just as important as the food.

00:53.170 --> 00:54.753
In this case go traditional.

00:54.753 --> 01:00.379
A blue striped table
cloth and napkins with
seashell accents...

01:00.379 --> 01:02.045
this meal can get
a little messy,

01:02.045 --> 01:05.212
if you do it right, so don't
forget the bibs.

01:05.212 --> 01:08.087
The key is the authenticity
she projects.

01:08.087 --> 01:10.671
She's bigger than a web series,
don't you think?

01:10.671 --> 01:11.671
Where did you find her?

01:11.671 --> 01:13.337
We met in college.

01:13.337 --> 01:14.546
New England, of course?

01:14.546 --> 01:16.170
Yale.

01:16.170 --> 01:17.337
Excellent.

01:17.337 --> 01:19.462
The simplest things can make
the biggest impact.

01:19.462 --> 01:23.170
Buckets for the shells or a
fishing net for a tablecloth.

01:23.170 --> 01:26.546
And if you don't have it then
ask a friend because they might.

01:26.546 --> 01:28.504
And after all,
what are friends for?

01:28.504 --> 01:31.671
As we say in New England, fun
doesn't have to be expensive.

01:31.671 --> 01:33.338
Imagination is free.

01:33.338 --> 01:37.296
Recipes and instructions for our
accessories are on our website.

01:37.296 --> 01:38.921
For now, this is Abby Porter,

01:38.921 --> 01:42.380
and you've been watching
New England My Way.

01:42.380 --> 01:43.755
I'll see you next time.

01:43.755 --> 01:45.088
And we're out.

01:45.088 --> 01:46.505
Nice work, Jacob.

01:46.505 --> 01:49.296
Can you get some inserts of the
food while it's still steaming?

01:49.296 --> 01:50.797
I need this online by 5:00.

01:50.797 --> 01:51.672
Sure.

01:51.672 --> 01:54.505
Abby Porter,
Michael Carrington.

01:54.505 --> 01:55.880
Of Carrington Enterprises.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.296
The biggest chain of home-goods
stores in New England.

01:58.296 --> 02:01.338
Like the rads say, 'If it's New
England, it's Carrington'.

02:01.338 --> 02:02.839
It's nice to meet you.

02:02.839 --> 02:06.297
And your enterprises.

02:06.297 --> 02:08.797
It's uh, quite the set-up
you have here.

02:08.797 --> 02:10.256
My mother loans us her kitchen

02:10.256 --> 02:12.714
and Jacob handles the video,
sound and lights,

02:12.714 --> 02:14.839
and Gina handles
everything else.

02:14.839 --> 02:18.256
Publicity and management,
all on a shoe string.

02:18.256 --> 02:19.339
For now.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.423
But we have big, big plans,

02:21.423 --> 02:23.631
and we're hoping you might
be a part of them.

02:23.631 --> 02:26.673
I'm always on the lookout
for new talent

02:26.673 --> 02:28.881
and you, Abby, you
show real promise.

02:28.881 --> 02:30.339
I mean, everything
looks delicious.

02:30.339 --> 02:31.506
It's a family recipe.

02:31.506 --> 02:34.132
An old New England
family recipe, yes?

02:34.132 --> 02:35.381
New England My Way.

02:35.381 --> 02:37.464
Great name by the way.

02:37.464 --> 02:38.340
Love it.

02:38.340 --> 02:39.424
It's authentic
and that's exactly

02:39.424 --> 02:41.007
what we're looking for,
Authenticity.

02:41.007 --> 02:43.340
Well if that's what
you're after look no further.

02:43.340 --> 02:46.798
Her roots go deep into
the Connecticut soil.

02:46.798 --> 02:49.840
Hmm. Abby, you and Carrington's
might be the perfect fit.

02:49.840 --> 02:53.965
Forty-seven stores,
six states, exclusive to
our New England community.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.966
Together we could create
a whole line

02:55.966 --> 02:58.549
of home products for
our target market.

02:58.549 --> 03:01.257
Sauce pans, sheets,
dish towels...

03:01.257 --> 03:02.340
You hear that?

03:02.340 --> 03:03.674
A full line.

03:03.674 --> 03:07.382
Your face, your name, in stores
all through the north east.

03:07.382 --> 03:09.174
Abby Porter is New England.

03:09.174 --> 03:11.049
You see, it is that kind
of honesty

03:11.049 --> 03:12.799
that our customers
will relate to.

03:12.799 --> 03:14.757
Mr. Carrington,
I'm actually from-

03:14.757 --> 03:17.341
So where do we go from here?

03:17.341 --> 03:19.341
Well, my board and I will be
looking closely

03:19.341 --> 03:21.841
at your upcoming webisodes
so make them personal

03:21.841 --> 03:22.675
because it's like I say,

03:22.675 --> 03:24.591
if we go into business together

03:24.591 --> 03:25.966
people aren't buying
your product,

03:25.966 --> 03:28.758
they're buying you, Abby.

03:28.758 --> 03:30.174
Me?

03:30.174 --> 03:32.425
From New England?

03:38.967 --> 03:41.175
But you're not from New England.

03:41.175 --> 03:42.092
Now, of course.

03:42.092 --> 03:43.883
But not originally.

03:43.883 --> 03:45.050
I know that, mom.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.675
Mr. Carrington doesn't.

03:47.675 --> 03:48.842
Are there more albums?

03:48.842 --> 03:50.592
No, that's everything
I could find.

03:50.592 --> 03:53.050
And most of the photos of you
as a child

03:53.050 --> 03:57.008
have a cactus or a longhorn
cattle in them.

03:57.008 --> 03:59.467
I was hoping there might be
one of a lighthouse

03:59.467 --> 04:00.718
or a lobster boat,

04:00.718 --> 04:04.009
something I might be able
to Photoshop myself into.

04:04.009 --> 04:05.384
I know this timing is terrible

04:05.384 --> 04:09.634
but I got a phone call earlier
from Janet Miller's mother.

04:09.634 --> 04:11.009
Do you remember Janet?

04:11.009 --> 04:13.884
Yeah, we were cheerleaders
together at Langston.

04:13.884 --> 04:14.968
Sure.

04:14.968 --> 04:15.926
Well, she wanted us to know
that your father

04:15.926 --> 04:18.093
fell off his horse yesterday.

04:18.093 --> 04:19.009
Oh no!

04:19.009 --> 04:19.926
Is he ok?

04:19.926 --> 04:20.759
Oh no, he's fine.

04:20.759 --> 04:21.759
He just hurt his shoulder,

04:21.759 --> 04:23.635
but he's gonna have
to take it easy

04:23.635 --> 04:26.343
for the next week or two
and uh,

04:26.343 --> 04:27.635
you know your father.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.510
Right. That is not
going to happen.

04:30.510 --> 04:33.343
Is there any chance that you
might be able to fly out

04:33.343 --> 04:36.635
and help him for
maybe a week or two?

04:36.635 --> 04:37.927
Uh...Mom.

04:37.927 --> 04:41.844
It can be so awkward
between me and dad.

04:41.844 --> 04:43.677
What makes you think he even
wants me there?

04:43.677 --> 04:45.177
You know he loves you.

04:45.177 --> 04:47.136
But nothing I do pleases him.

04:47.136 --> 04:49.511
He finds some fault
in everything.

04:49.511 --> 04:50.969
Oh, I think that's
just in your head.

04:50.969 --> 04:55.177
But if you believe that
look at it like

04:55.177 --> 05:00.219
a chance to mend fences.

05:00.219 --> 05:03.594
Can you go?

05:03.594 --> 05:06.053
If he needs me,
you know I'm there.

05:06.053 --> 05:08.636
That's my Texas girl.

05:08.636 --> 05:10.803
If only I was your
New England girl.

05:10.803 --> 05:13.095
Oh, you know I might have
a few more photo albums

05:13.095 --> 05:15.511
in the guest bedroom closet.

05:15.511 --> 05:16.220
I'll go look.

05:16.220 --> 05:26.303
Ok.

05:26.303 --> 05:27.220
Hello?

05:27.220 --> 05:28.886
Gina.

05:28.886 --> 05:30.721
We need to talk.

05:33.303 --> 05:36.429
[cows mooing]

06:08.013 --> 06:10.722
Well, Texas, I'm back.

06:10.722 --> 06:13.596
I hope we're both ready
for this.

06:25.013 --> 06:29.055
[cows mooing]

06:45.014 --> 06:48.764
Abby, that's you already.

06:48.764 --> 06:49.806
Hey, Dad.

06:49.806 --> 06:52.306
I didn't expect you
until suppertime.

06:56.265 --> 06:57.306
Howdy.

06:59.598 --> 07:00.889
You didn't have
to drop everything

07:00.889 --> 07:01.848
and come all this way.

07:01.848 --> 07:03.306
I'll be good as new in no time.

07:03.306 --> 07:05.682
I heard a few weeks.

07:05.682 --> 07:08.265
What's a few weeks?

07:08.265 --> 07:10.056
Come on, let's get your bags.

07:10.056 --> 07:11.015
Ok.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.515
Ok.

07:20.515 --> 07:23.932
So, how's your mama doing
these days?

07:23.932 --> 07:27.057
She's off to a wedding
in London.

07:27.057 --> 07:29.433
London.

07:29.433 --> 07:31.765
What a crazy pair we made.

07:31.765 --> 07:35.849
You know, they don't build towns
big enough for her.

07:35.849 --> 07:38.516
Or small enough for me.

07:38.516 --> 07:40.516
It's like you, I guess.

07:40.516 --> 07:43.141
You're definitely
your mama's daughter.

07:43.141 --> 07:45.891
I'm your daughter, too, Dad.

07:45.891 --> 07:47.474
I miss you.

07:47.474 --> 07:48.558
Yes.

07:48.558 --> 07:50.516
I've just been so busy
with my new web series.

07:50.516 --> 07:51.808
You got your own life.

07:51.808 --> 07:55.516
I get that, yeah.

07:55.516 --> 07:58.475
Have you seen my show?

08:01.475 --> 08:04.225
I- I look in on it.

08:04.225 --> 08:10.100
I saw one, it was entirely
on blenders.

08:10.100 --> 08:14.016
I tell you one thing, you
don't do anything halfway.

08:14.016 --> 08:16.350
Exactly.

08:16.350 --> 08:18.517
So, tell me what needs doing
around here

08:18.517 --> 08:20.642
and consider it done.

08:20.642 --> 08:23.059
Dressed like that?

08:23.059 --> 08:24.642
[chuckles]
I don't think so.

08:24.642 --> 08:25.892
Well, this was
just for the plane.

08:25.892 --> 08:27.684
I brought plenty of clothes.

08:27.684 --> 08:28.934
No really, it's ok.

08:28.934 --> 08:32.183
I hired a new ranch manager
a few weeks back.

08:32.183 --> 08:33.101
He's good.

08:33.101 --> 08:34.892
Gets most everything done.

08:34.892 --> 08:39.308
At least until I can get out
of this contraption.

08:39.308 --> 08:40.727
I'm here to pick up the slack,

08:40.727 --> 08:45.101
so whatever he can't do
you can count on me.

08:48.643 --> 08:51.018
Speak of the devil.

08:51.018 --> 08:52.768
New manager?

08:54.351 --> 08:56.227
New to some.

08:56.227 --> 08:59.852
Maybe not so much to you.

08:59.852 --> 09:01.893
Someone I know?

09:02.810 --> 09:03.519
Dad?

09:03.519 --> 09:04.935
[chuckles]

09:04.935 --> 09:07.519
Dad?

09:07.519 --> 09:09.644
Dad, who is it?

09:22.811 --> 09:24.352
Well, well, well.

09:24.352 --> 09:25.394
Ryan.

09:25.394 --> 09:27.936
Look who's back home
on the range.

09:27.936 --> 09:29.894
Abby.

09:29.894 --> 09:32.686
What a surprise.

09:32.686 --> 09:34.353
So your dad didn't tell you?

09:34.353 --> 09:35.686
Just about to.

09:35.686 --> 09:36.769
Hmm.

09:36.769 --> 09:40.478
How 'bout I give you two
a chance to catch up?

09:40.478 --> 09:43.270
Well, he didn't tell me
you were comin', either.

09:43.270 --> 09:45.437
Well, how could I stay away?

09:45.437 --> 09:46.895
After his accident and all,

09:46.895 --> 09:49.520
so he needs an extra hand
and I'm here to help out.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.603
[laughs]

09:50.603 --> 09:51.603
What?

09:51.603 --> 09:52.645
Oh boy.

09:53.687 --> 09:56.187
You're here to help out?

09:56.187 --> 10:00.520
For as long as I can be
helpful, yes.

10:00.520 --> 10:04.438
Ok, so a short visit, then?

10:04.438 --> 10:08.229
What's so funny?

10:08.229 --> 10:10.729
Look, don't get me wrong,
you look...

10:10.729 --> 10:15.354
you look great, but uh, you're
dressed for a garden party.

10:15.354 --> 10:17.771
Well, I just got here.

10:17.771 --> 10:21.604
I haven't had a chance
to change yet.

10:21.604 --> 10:24.229
Well, you've changed plenty
since high school.

10:24.229 --> 10:25.896
Not much, really.

10:25.896 --> 10:26.938
If you say so.

10:26.938 --> 10:28.354
Is this gonna be a problem?

10:28.354 --> 10:31.813
Us having to work together
for the next two weeks?

10:31.813 --> 10:33.855
Not for me.

10:33.855 --> 10:35.438
What happened between us
was years ago.

10:35.438 --> 10:37.855
I mean, who even remembers?

10:37.855 --> 10:39.771
Well, good.

10:39.771 --> 10:41.063
Good then.

10:41.063 --> 10:42.771
Well, if you're here to help
you can start right now.

10:42.771 --> 10:46.522
We gotta get all this stuff out
of the truck and into the barn.

10:46.522 --> 10:49.230
Uh, yeah. Ok.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.522
In a minute.

10:56.772 --> 11:00.106
You're stuck on that
yellow rose, ain't ya?

11:00.106 --> 11:03.106
No. I haven't seen these
in a while.

11:03.106 --> 11:04.273
Ooh, they're pretty.

11:04.273 --> 11:05.939
Did you plant these?

11:06.981 --> 11:09.189
[phone ringing]

11:09.189 --> 11:10.356
Gina?

11:10.356 --> 11:12.772
So I'm just off the phone
with Carrington.

11:12.772 --> 11:13.689
[sighs]

11:13.689 --> 11:14.731
No, what now?

11:14.731 --> 11:15.731
See how negative you are?

11:15.731 --> 11:18.189
Always expecting the worst.

11:18.189 --> 11:19.356
Just tell me.

11:19.356 --> 11:21.189
He wants a full bio on you
to pass on to his board.

11:21.189 --> 11:23.773
One that doesn't mention Texas,
I assume.

11:23.773 --> 11:25.690
Don't worry, I've got
this handled.

11:25.690 --> 11:28.690
I'm thinking you were born
in Greenwich.

11:28.690 --> 11:31.857
Look, he's buying New England,
we need to give him New England.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.107
Even if we have to stretch
the truth a little.

11:34.107 --> 11:37.565
Oh, I really don't
feel good about this.

11:37.565 --> 11:38.440
Relax.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.648
You'll feel good
about the cheques.

11:40.648 --> 11:42.315
I really can't do this
right now.

11:42.315 --> 11:44.482
Bad time?

11:44.482 --> 11:48.357
Well, my dad's being sweet
but... a little standoffish.

11:48.357 --> 11:51.482
His new ranch manager is
my old high school boyfriend

11:51.482 --> 11:54.566
and I'm kind of stuck
at the moment.

11:54.566 --> 11:56.315
Hey, I gotta go.

11:56.315 --> 11:57.983
Oh, I-

12:00.524 --> 12:02.941
I was getting to that.

12:02.941 --> 12:03.899
Uh-huh.

12:03.899 --> 12:05.066
What?

12:05.066 --> 12:06.524
I was.

12:06.524 --> 12:08.024
Ok.

12:17.691 --> 12:19.650
[exhales]

12:19.650 --> 12:22.483
New England will have to wait.

12:30.525 --> 12:33.442
[cows mooing]

12:56.276 --> 12:58.484
I really appreciate
the extra hours, Ryan.

12:58.484 --> 13:00.735
Feelin' pretty helpless
with this arm in a sling.

13:00.735 --> 13:03.735
Well, it's nice that Abby's here
to help carry some of the load.

13:03.735 --> 13:04.735
Yeah.

13:04.735 --> 13:06.693
It's great that she's tryin'
and all but,

13:06.693 --> 13:08.193
I mean, we both know
she's more into

13:08.193 --> 13:09.776
arts and crafts than ranches.

13:09.776 --> 13:11.443
Yeah, she may surprise you.

13:11.443 --> 13:14.901
I gave up on that dream
long ago.

13:14.901 --> 13:16.402
Yeah, well...

13:17.693 --> 13:20.193
She may surprise us both.

13:20.193 --> 13:21.235
Well...

13:24.068 --> 13:25.860
Sorry, I'm late.

13:25.860 --> 13:27.860
Just jet lag and all.

13:27.860 --> 13:31.402
Hey Dad, I'm impressed
you picked up bagels.

13:31.402 --> 13:33.235
Where'd you find that?

13:33.235 --> 13:34.318
Kitchen counter.

13:34.318 --> 13:39.027
Those are suet rings
for the hens.

13:39.027 --> 13:39.944
Ok.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.111
[laughs]

13:42.111 --> 13:44.444
You plan to work in those?

13:47.278 --> 13:48.194
What?

13:48.194 --> 13:49.527
These boots?

13:49.527 --> 13:50.902
What's wrong with them?

13:50.902 --> 13:53.777
I'd be willing to bet those
boots cost more than my truck.

13:53.777 --> 13:56.528
You might be right
but I'm good.

13:56.528 --> 13:58.111
I'm ready for anything.

13:58.111 --> 13:58.944
What's the plan?

13:58.944 --> 14:00.194
What can I do?

14:00.194 --> 14:02.361
Well, those are two
very different questions.

14:02.361 --> 14:05.111
I'm gonna check on that heifer
that was calving last night.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.278
I'm afraid the mother
might abandon it.

14:07.278 --> 14:08.361
Well, I can do that.

14:08.361 --> 14:09.820
You need to be taking it easy.

14:09.820 --> 14:13.154
Abby, I said I was gonna check
on the heifer,

14:13.154 --> 14:14.695
not carry it to the pasture.

14:14.695 --> 14:16.528
As a matter of fact, Ryan,

14:16.528 --> 14:20.237
why don't you remind Abby
how to clean the chicken coop?

14:20.237 --> 14:22.279
Hens lay better
on fresh shavings.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.987
Ok, I think I can still handle
the chickens.

14:24.987 --> 14:30.612
Just to be safe, let Ryan show
you how we do it these days.

14:32.903 --> 14:37.112
[chickens clucking]

14:37.696 --> 14:40.362
Word is you're a tastemaker.

14:40.362 --> 14:42.195
That's a new one for me.

14:42.195 --> 14:43.696
I recommend things.

14:43.696 --> 14:46.696
Appliances, bedding, wine.

14:46.696 --> 14:48.362
There's money in that?

14:48.362 --> 14:49.863
I'm working on it.

14:49.863 --> 14:52.113
Alright, well I recommend
you let me take care

14:52.113 --> 14:53.321
of these ladies.

14:53.321 --> 14:56.280
Wouldn't want you to ruin
them fancy boots.

14:56.280 --> 14:59.238
I'm the one that was brought up
on a ranch, remember?

14:59.238 --> 15:01.029
You're the one who lived
in town.

15:01.029 --> 15:04.196
Yeah, well, I got my master's
in ranch management.

15:04.196 --> 15:05.655
I'm impressed.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.029
You're really into this
ranching thing, huh?

15:08.029 --> 15:09.155
Yeah.

15:09.155 --> 15:11.280
What do your parents think
about that?

15:11.280 --> 15:12.488
They're all for it.

15:12.488 --> 15:15.864
They retired to Scottsdale,
left me the house.

15:15.864 --> 15:17.697
That beautiful old farmhouse?

15:17.697 --> 15:19.864
Yeah, I'm fixin' it up.

15:19.864 --> 15:21.322
Living there for now.

15:21.322 --> 15:23.989
Got plans to move?

15:23.989 --> 15:25.572
Alright, now you're
just stallin'.

15:25.572 --> 15:26.739
No, I'm not.

15:26.739 --> 15:27.780
[laughs]

15:27.780 --> 15:28.697
Just tryin' to get to know you,
that's all.

15:28.697 --> 15:29.614
Get on in there.

15:29.614 --> 15:30.614
Come on, you gonna clean
this coop

15:30.614 --> 15:31.822
or are you gonna clean
the coop?

15:31.822 --> 15:32.905
I'm gonna clean the coop.

15:32.905 --> 15:35.322
[laughs]

15:35.322 --> 15:41.448
[chickens clucking]

15:43.823 --> 15:45.531
Ok, maybe you're right.

15:45.531 --> 15:48.531
I didn't dress for this.

15:50.364 --> 15:52.698
There's an easy fix for that.

15:55.115 --> 16:03.699
â™ª

16:11.282 --> 16:13.782
[door bell chimes]

16:18.240 --> 16:19.866
I'll take one of everything.

16:19.866 --> 16:23.032
Don't joke with me
'cause I'll sell it to you.

16:23.032 --> 16:24.365
Janet!

16:24.365 --> 16:25.199
Abby!

16:25.199 --> 16:26.366
You work here?

16:26.366 --> 16:29.032
Worse, I own the place.

16:29.032 --> 16:30.615
Hey, Ryan.

16:30.615 --> 16:31.699
It is so great to see you.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.533
Let me take a good look.

16:33.533 --> 16:35.283
So stylish.

16:35.283 --> 16:37.241
That's actually why we're here.

16:37.241 --> 16:40.408
She needs to get some
more practical outfits.

16:40.408 --> 16:41.783
I'm gonna go get some coffee
at Sam's,

16:41.783 --> 16:45.199
but y'all shoot up a flare
when you're done.

16:45.199 --> 16:46.950
You and Ryan again?

16:46.950 --> 16:48.783
Something I should know about?

16:48.783 --> 16:50.867
We're just working together
for a few days,

16:50.867 --> 16:52.616
helping my dad
while his arm heals.

16:52.616 --> 16:55.033
Not even a little bit
of chemistry?

16:55.033 --> 16:55.992
No chemistry.

16:55.992 --> 16:57.367
None of the earth sciences.

16:57.367 --> 17:00.409
So, now can we talk about some
real jeans and work boots?

17:00.409 --> 17:01.658
You got it.

17:01.658 --> 17:04.492
But I wanna hear the whole story
while you try things on.

17:04.492 --> 17:06.659
There's no story.

17:11.950 --> 17:13.659
Is there anything left
on the shelves?

17:13.659 --> 17:16.159
I just bought the basics.

17:16.159 --> 17:17.659
I'm guessing you worked up
an appetite

17:17.659 --> 17:19.367
on this little shopping spree.

17:19.367 --> 17:21.867
Wanna grab a burger
on the way back?

17:21.867 --> 17:23.951
I have a better idea.

17:46.076 --> 17:48.744
You know, a drive-through burger
would have been easier.

17:48.744 --> 17:50.035
This is easy.

17:50.035 --> 17:51.618
It's a classic French omelette.

17:51.618 --> 17:54.493
What's the difference between a
French and an American omelette?

17:54.493 --> 17:56.535
An American omelette is folded.

17:56.535 --> 17:57.994
The French roll theirs.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.910
Pretty sure my taste buds
wouldn't know the difference.

18:00.910 --> 18:03.119
Just try it.

18:03.119 --> 18:04.369
I added some chilis.

18:04.369 --> 18:07.702
Just for a little extra kick.

18:07.702 --> 18:10.785
French fusion.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.369
Leave it to you
to complicate eggs.

18:12.369 --> 18:16.619
I'm not complicating them,
I'm elevating them.

18:19.161 --> 18:20.035
You like it?

18:20.035 --> 18:21.703
Where did all this come from?

18:21.703 --> 18:23.995
The girl I used to know
was all tacos and take-out.

18:23.995 --> 18:30.995
I still love all of that, I just
like exploring other foods.

18:30.995 --> 18:32.870
Word around town is that
you were dating a shortstop

18:32.870 --> 18:35.370
for the Mets.

18:35.370 --> 18:36.536
Very old news.

18:36.536 --> 18:38.036
We broke up.

18:38.036 --> 18:40.579
He used the wrong salad fork?

18:44.078 --> 18:45.495
What about you?

18:45.495 --> 18:51.328
After I left I heard you
and Cheryl Packer were a thing.

18:51.328 --> 18:52.912
Homecoming queen.

18:52.912 --> 18:54.537
Well, we went to one movie

18:54.537 --> 18:56.662
and then she left me
for the quarterback.

18:56.662 --> 18:59.328
Besides, I don't have much time
for dating anyway.

18:59.328 --> 19:02.954
My dad doesn't work you
that hard, does he?

19:02.954 --> 19:04.912
Oh, I'm fixing up my folks'
place in my spare time,

19:04.912 --> 19:06.537
getting ready to sell.

19:06.537 --> 19:09.912
I need a down payment if I'm
gonna buy a ranch of my own.

19:09.912 --> 19:10.704
Ah.

19:10.704 --> 19:12.329
Any chance that's for me?

19:12.329 --> 19:13.746
It is now.

19:13.746 --> 19:15.954
French, huh?

19:15.954 --> 19:17.163
You know that?

19:17.163 --> 19:21.747
Yeah, it's the way your mother
used to fix these.

19:23.038 --> 19:23.913
Mmm.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.705
Not half bad.

19:25.705 --> 19:27.705
Chilis.

19:27.705 --> 19:29.913
Nice touch.

19:29.913 --> 19:30.538
Really?

19:30.538 --> 19:34.038
You like it?

19:34.038 --> 19:35.580
How's the chicken coop comin'?

19:35.580 --> 19:36.747
You get that done yet?

19:36.747 --> 19:38.247
I had to make a run
into town,

19:38.247 --> 19:40.872
Abby came along
to keep me company.

19:40.872 --> 19:41.788
Hmm.

19:41.788 --> 19:43.038
But I'm getting right to it.

19:43.038 --> 19:44.038
I hope so.

19:44.038 --> 19:45.330
Plenty more to do
when that's done.

19:45.330 --> 19:48.080
Yeah.

20:01.706 --> 20:04.706
You could pitch in whenever
you want, you know.

20:04.706 --> 20:06.081
Oh, I like watching you work.

20:06.081 --> 20:09.373
It's something
I've never seen before.

20:09.373 --> 20:11.248
Besides, I am busy.

20:11.248 --> 20:13.706
Something interesting
on that phone?

20:13.706 --> 20:16.206
Just checking out your website.

20:16.206 --> 20:19.165
Ivy league education,
summers in Maine.

20:19.165 --> 20:20.540
Mmmhmm.

20:20.540 --> 20:23.832
A few guest appearances on some
tv shows I ain't never heard of.

20:23.832 --> 20:25.248
Oh, they're big in New England.

20:25.248 --> 20:26.331
Mmmhmm.

20:26.331 --> 20:27.540
I'll take your word for it.

20:27.540 --> 20:31.082
You know, there's no mention
in here of Texas.

20:31.082 --> 20:32.957
There wasn't much room
in my bio.

20:32.957 --> 20:34.290
Uh-huh.

20:34.290 --> 20:36.498
Enough to say you were born
in Greenwich?

20:36.498 --> 20:37.707
[laughs]

20:37.707 --> 20:39.291
Now see, I thought that
miraculous event

20:39.291 --> 20:41.582
happened right here in Langston,
am I wrong?

20:41.582 --> 20:43.166
It's Greenwich.

20:43.166 --> 20:45.416
It's probably an autocorrect.

20:45.416 --> 20:47.623
Of course,
Langston to Greenwich.

20:47.623 --> 20:49.499
That's a weird leap.

20:49.499 --> 20:51.332
I'm sure you'll fix it.

20:51.332 --> 20:53.750
Eventually.

20:53.750 --> 20:56.040
Hey, good work.

20:56.040 --> 20:59.458
Wish my dad would say that.

20:59.458 --> 21:02.374
Nothing I ever did on this ranch
was good enough for him.

21:02.374 --> 21:04.875
His words?

21:04.875 --> 21:06.207
A kid can tell.

21:06.207 --> 21:10.000
You know, it was clear
he always wanted a son.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.541
Or at least a tomboy.

21:11.541 --> 21:14.041
Instead he got a lifestyle
expert.

21:14.041 --> 21:15.708
Yep.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.125
I just got a call that the feed
order is ready for pick-up

21:18.125 --> 21:19.708
so I need you to drive
into town.

21:19.708 --> 21:22.041
Could you take my truck
and gas her up on the way?

21:22.041 --> 21:24.167
No problem. You bet.

21:24.167 --> 21:25.875
I was talkin' to Ryan.

21:25.875 --> 21:27.542
It's a stick.

21:27.542 --> 21:29.083
I can do it, Dad.

21:29.083 --> 21:34.208
Yeah, um... the clutch,
it's a bit tricky.

21:34.208 --> 21:38.250
I drove it when I was a kid,
remember?

21:38.250 --> 21:39.459
Well, I do now.

21:39.459 --> 21:42.375
Maybe Ryan should ride along
just to be safe.

21:42.375 --> 21:44.792
Whatever you say, boss.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.293
You don't trust me?

21:46.293 --> 21:47.625
Oh, I trust ya.

21:47.625 --> 21:49.667
I just don't want what happened
to the tractor

21:49.667 --> 21:52.334
to happen to my truck.

21:53.126 --> 21:54.418
What did I tell you?

21:54.418 --> 21:59.376
He'll never change no matter
how much I wish he would.

21:59.376 --> 22:01.752
Let's drive that truck.

22:03.877 --> 22:10.002
[engine rumbles along]

22:13.334 --> 22:15.626
[engine stalls]

22:15.626 --> 22:18.210
I can't believe he hasn't
upgraded this old thing.

22:18.210 --> 22:20.210
It's ok. Just take it easy.

22:20.210 --> 22:21.544
And breathe.

22:21.544 --> 22:23.419
Engine off.

22:23.419 --> 22:25.544
Alright, now push in the clutch
all the way.

22:25.544 --> 22:29.169
Start the engine.

22:29.169 --> 22:30.711
Now, when you let out the clutch

22:30.711 --> 22:32.711
you're gonna wanna give it
a little gas.

22:32.711 --> 22:33.753
Ok.

22:39.210 --> 22:40.669
[engine stalls]

22:40.669 --> 22:41.711
Aargh!!!

22:41.711 --> 22:45.419
Who has a stick shift
anything anymore?

22:45.419 --> 22:47.377
What did I do now?

22:47.377 --> 22:49.378
You flooded it.

22:49.378 --> 22:51.753
It's alright, just
give it a minute.

22:51.753 --> 22:55.462
I mean, it's not like
we're tying up traffic.

22:57.628 --> 23:00.961
Back east there'd be a long line
of cars

23:00.961 --> 23:03.295
honking their horns at us.

23:03.295 --> 23:09.712
Out here it's just miles and
miles of... miles and miles.

23:09.712 --> 23:12.378
It's so beautiful.

23:12.378 --> 23:15.462
It's so quiet.

23:15.462 --> 23:18.670
Is this why you decided to go
to college in Dallas

23:18.670 --> 23:21.503
and not back east?

23:21.503 --> 23:22.379
Oh, come on.

23:22.379 --> 23:25.254
I never woulda fit in
at Yale.

23:25.254 --> 23:26.920
Well, I was there.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.879
Or was that part of
the problem?

23:28.879 --> 23:30.337
No.

23:30.337 --> 23:33.212
Nah, that had nothing
to do with it.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.212
I wanted to study
ranch management,

23:35.212 --> 23:37.254
and you would be shocked
to learn

23:37.254 --> 23:39.880
how few courses Yale has
in ranch management.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.546
[laughing]

23:42.546 --> 23:46.671
Still, it would have been nice.

23:49.379 --> 23:51.671
Yeah. We were too different.

23:51.671 --> 23:54.671
I didn't wanna admit it
at the time.

23:54.671 --> 23:58.297
Easier to blame me for leaving,
was it?

23:58.297 --> 24:00.338
No, no.

24:00.338 --> 24:02.297
No, you weren't cut out
for this life

24:02.297 --> 24:04.921
just like I wasn't cut out
for that life.

24:04.921 --> 24:08.172
Simple as that.

24:08.172 --> 24:12.505
So where did that leave us?

24:12.505 --> 24:14.964
Stuck on the side of the road,
apparently.

24:14.964 --> 24:17.922
[laughs]

24:17.922 --> 24:22.089
Try it again.

24:22.089 --> 24:24.589
The engine.

24:24.589 --> 24:25.630
Right.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.214
Yeah, the engine.

24:27.214 --> 24:29.714
-Obviously.
-Obviously.

24:29.714 --> 24:32.173
Ok, what am I doing?

24:32.173 --> 24:33.214
Oh, just push in the clutch.

24:33.214 --> 24:33.714
Ok.

24:33.714 --> 24:35.548
Start 'er up.

24:35.548 --> 24:36.715
[starts engine]

24:36.715 --> 24:38.423
Put it in gear.

24:38.423 --> 24:39.757
We're back in business.

24:39.757 --> 24:41.381
[message alert]

24:41.381 --> 24:43.256
Oh, some- something important?

24:43.256 --> 24:45.673
Maybe.

24:45.673 --> 24:47.923
Do you mind if I make
a quick stop on the way?

24:47.923 --> 24:50.339
Sure, just tell me how
to get there

24:50.339 --> 24:52.048
and I'll try and get us there.

24:52.048 --> 24:53.381
[laughing]

24:53.381 --> 24:54.631
Alright, you're gonna hang
a left here.

24:54.631 --> 24:57.007
Oh, left. Ok, great.

24:57.007 --> 25:01.340
â™ª

25:01.340 --> 25:03.466
[laughing]

25:08.923 --> 25:12.340
[engine rumbles]

25:12.340 --> 25:13.841
Alright, now as you
get up there,

25:13.841 --> 25:15.632
you wanna keep going.

25:15.632 --> 25:18.674
Clutch in. Brake.

25:18.674 --> 25:20.340
Brake hard.

25:26.632 --> 25:28.133
Your parents old house.

25:28.133 --> 25:30.175
Mine now.

25:30.175 --> 25:31.883
Your grandparents
built it, right?

25:31.883 --> 25:32.799
Mmmhmm.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.175
1932.

25:34.175 --> 25:36.467
I gotta leave the key under
the mat for a showing later.

25:36.467 --> 25:38.758
It's a shame to have to sell.

25:38.758 --> 25:41.717
Yeah, well, if I wanna afford
my own ranch...

25:41.717 --> 25:46.550
Even with that, it'll be miles
out of town, prices these days.

25:46.550 --> 25:49.592
Isn't that the Blakely's
pasture across the way?

25:49.592 --> 25:51.383
You have a good memory.

25:51.383 --> 25:55.300
He's let it go for so long and
he's getting up there in years.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.092
I wonder how much
that would cost.

25:57.092 --> 25:59.259
It's out of my budget.

25:59.259 --> 26:02.217
I gotta sell,
like it or not.

26:02.217 --> 26:04.092
Any bites yet?

26:04.092 --> 26:06.468
Not even a nibble.

26:06.468 --> 26:09.092
You need a fresh coat of paint
on the verandah.

26:09.092 --> 26:12.800
You need a really bright colour
to make that porch swing pop,

26:12.800 --> 26:14.509
patterned pillows,
maybe a window box

26:14.509 --> 26:16.760
with some geraniums.

26:16.760 --> 26:19.926
They love the sun.

26:19.926 --> 26:22.384
Can I see the inside?

26:22.384 --> 26:23.926
Pretty much like you remember,
I guess.

26:23.926 --> 26:25.593
Come on.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.551
You've been working on this?

26:36.551 --> 26:38.343
Not that I doubt you.

26:38.343 --> 26:41.968
Yeah, plumbing, electric,
that sort of thing.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.218
Well, you need to make
an impression

26:44.218 --> 26:47.594
with what potential buyers
can actually see.

26:47.594 --> 26:49.719
Have you thought
about staging it?

26:49.719 --> 26:50.844
Staging it?

26:50.844 --> 26:53.635
You could get more
than you're asking, I bet.

26:53.635 --> 26:56.969
A few easy changes can make
a big difference.

26:56.969 --> 27:00.927
Like an area rug
or some lighting.

27:00.927 --> 27:03.136
There's some good furniture
stores in Marshall.

27:03.136 --> 27:05.303
Can't take a whole day off
for that.

27:05.303 --> 27:07.511
We'll check out what
the hardware store has.

27:07.511 --> 27:09.428
Gotta pick up that feed anyway.

27:09.428 --> 27:10.719
Hardware store?

27:10.719 --> 27:15.178
What are we going to find
at a hardware store?

27:27.095 --> 27:28.720
Hey, can you have one
of your guys load this

27:28.720 --> 27:30.220
into Wes Porter's truck?

27:30.220 --> 27:32.386
It's parked around back.

27:32.386 --> 27:33.845
Thanks, man.

27:36.095 --> 27:37.636
Well?

27:37.636 --> 27:38.887
What do you think?

27:38.887 --> 27:42.387
I think this is not the hardware
store that I remember.

27:42.387 --> 27:44.345
When did they get
home furnishings?

27:44.345 --> 27:46.387
Hey, we keep up with the times.

27:46.387 --> 27:50.387
Ooh, these Adirondacks would be
perfect on your verandah.

27:50.387 --> 27:51.846
In Texas?

27:51.846 --> 27:52.679
For what?

27:52.679 --> 27:53.679
Sitting.

27:53.679 --> 27:55.637
And shucking oysters?

27:55.637 --> 27:58.637
This would be perfect
in your entryway.

27:58.637 --> 28:00.138
It could also drain
my bank account.

28:00.138 --> 28:02.596
We're not buying,
we're borrowing.

28:02.596 --> 28:03.554
You can do that?

28:03.554 --> 28:05.804
It doesn't hurt to ask.

28:05.804 --> 28:07.180
Leave it to me.

28:07.180 --> 28:09.096
It's what I do, remember?

28:09.096 --> 28:13.388
How about "Icy Lemon"
for the kitchen?

28:13.388 --> 28:16.513
Or "Cookie Dough"?

28:16.513 --> 28:18.305
Ooh, I like this one.

28:18.305 --> 28:21.305
"Ginger Wasabi".

28:21.305 --> 28:23.638
Is this too confusing for you?

28:23.638 --> 28:25.430
No, but it's making me hungry.

28:25.430 --> 28:26.555
[laughs]

28:26.555 --> 28:29.055
Ok, we'll take two gallons
of the "Ginger Wasabi".

28:29.055 --> 28:30.847
It's over here.

28:50.723 --> 28:54.014
And here I thought you two made
a run for the border.

28:54.014 --> 28:56.972
Sorry, it took a while.

28:56.972 --> 28:58.222
Looks like there's
more than feed

28:58.222 --> 29:00.389
in the bed of my truck there.

29:00.389 --> 29:01.806
Ah, chairs, flowers.

29:01.806 --> 29:02.890
Nice rug.

29:02.890 --> 29:04.723
Abby's helping me pick out
stuff for the house.

29:04.723 --> 29:05.723
Ah, wonderful.

29:05.723 --> 29:08.265
'Cause meanwhile two longhorns
got loose

29:08.265 --> 29:10.723
and went into the neighbour's
field again.

29:10.723 --> 29:11.890
I'll get on it, boss.

29:11.890 --> 29:12.973
Just like I thought.

29:12.973 --> 29:16.223
That calf's been abandoned
by its mother.

29:16.223 --> 29:18.223
We're gonna have to feed it
by hand for a while.

29:18.223 --> 29:23.182
Abby, you think you can rope
him in and give him a bottle?

29:23.182 --> 29:24.056
Absolutely.

29:24.056 --> 29:25.056
Leave it to me.

29:25.056 --> 29:27.557
Ok.

29:32.849 --> 29:34.640
You good?

29:34.640 --> 29:36.724
Roping was never my strong suit.

29:36.724 --> 29:38.141
Just remember to keep
your index finger

29:38.141 --> 29:41.141
pointed down the shaft of
the rope towards the hondo.

29:41.141 --> 29:42.057
Hondo?

29:42.057 --> 29:45.057
It's the loop the rope
goes through.

29:45.057 --> 29:46.308
Ah, right.

29:46.308 --> 29:48.016
Yeah, it's coming back to me.

29:48.016 --> 29:49.558
Yeah.

29:49.558 --> 29:50.682
It's not, is it?

29:50.682 --> 29:52.016
Not even a little.

29:52.016 --> 29:54.224
[laughs]

29:54.224 --> 29:56.849
And then...?

29:56.849 --> 29:58.725
Oh, ok.

29:58.725 --> 30:02.433
Get your rope... you're gonna
wanna really twist your wrist.

30:02.433 --> 30:03.391
Ok.

30:03.391 --> 30:04.933
And as you start
to swing it, right?

30:04.933 --> 30:06.224
Mmmhmm.

30:06.224 --> 30:08.725
And let the rope kinda move
in your hand.

30:08.725 --> 30:11.600
Twist your wrist and swing it.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.850
Uh-huh, there you go!
Swing it.

30:13.850 --> 30:15.142
When you let it go,
follow through.

30:15.142 --> 30:17.225
It's just like throwin' a ball.
It's all in the wrist.

30:17.225 --> 30:18.641
You got it?

30:18.641 --> 30:20.392
Yeah. I got it.

30:20.392 --> 30:22.892
Definitely.

30:22.892 --> 30:24.933
Ok. Good luck.

30:28.601 --> 30:31.184
How hard can it be?

30:42.143 --> 30:44.185
Come here, buddy.

30:44.185 --> 30:45.934
I'm not gonna hurt you.

30:45.934 --> 30:48.351
Just gonna get you fed.

30:48.351 --> 30:49.435
[cows mooing]

30:57.851 --> 31:00.059
Come here.

31:04.560 --> 31:05.560
You ok?

31:05.560 --> 31:08.894
Let's go.

31:08.894 --> 31:11.894
[cows mooing]

31:12.310 --> 31:13.769
There you go.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.436
Find those longhorns yet?

31:21.436 --> 31:23.269
Back where they belong.

31:23.269 --> 31:25.519
I see you made a friend
while I was gone.

31:25.519 --> 31:27.060
You don't give up easy, do you?

31:27.060 --> 31:29.102
Careful, that is
dangerously close

31:29.102 --> 31:31.269
to a full-on compliment.

31:31.269 --> 31:33.728
We'll have none of that here
at the Porter Ranch.

31:33.728 --> 31:36.227
Mmm. Consider me warned.

31:36.227 --> 31:38.227
So I loaded all that household
stuff into my truck,

31:38.227 --> 31:40.060
wondered if you could
come by later

31:40.060 --> 31:42.020
and help me figure out
what to do with it.

31:42.020 --> 31:43.478
Tonight?

31:43.478 --> 31:45.603
If you can get some time off.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.519
I think I can swing it.

31:47.519 --> 31:49.686
I'll even make dinner.

31:49.686 --> 31:51.895
Am I taking my life
in my hands?

31:51.895 --> 31:54.395
What's life without a little
risk every now and then?

31:54.395 --> 31:57.562
[laughs]

32:04.936 --> 32:08.061
How did I ever let that one go?

32:19.104 --> 32:21.021
You're right about
these geraniums.

32:21.021 --> 32:22.812
They really do brighten
the place.

32:22.812 --> 32:24.354
Just wait 'til
I'm finished here.

32:24.354 --> 32:27.645
Just a few more touches and
then we'll tackle the inside.

32:27.645 --> 32:30.937
Ooh, I bet I could do a whole
episode on porch swings.

32:30.937 --> 32:35.521
We spent a few good hours
in that one, if I recall.

32:35.521 --> 32:38.396
That seems like so long ago.

32:38.396 --> 32:41.938
To me it seems like yesterday.

32:46.105 --> 32:47.980
Wine with dinner?

32:47.980 --> 32:49.480
I wouldn't say no.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.480
It's uh, it's local.

32:51.480 --> 32:52.855
I thought you might like it.

32:52.855 --> 32:55.730
I don't remember there being
grape vineyards in Langston,

32:55.730 --> 32:58.189
much less some wineries.

32:58.189 --> 32:59.439
There's a few varieties

32:59.439 --> 33:01.272
that like the sun
and the soil out here.

33:01.272 --> 33:03.397
We got it all these days.

33:03.397 --> 33:06.189
Stick around, I'll show you.

33:19.064 --> 33:21.898
This is really, really good.

33:21.898 --> 33:24.564
Well, don't sound so surprised,
you might hurt my feelings.

33:24.564 --> 33:25.522
[laughs]

33:25.522 --> 33:27.231
What's in this barbecue sauce?

33:27.231 --> 33:30.606
It's my grandpa's old recipe,
with a few tweaks of my own.

33:30.606 --> 33:32.064
You approve?

33:32.064 --> 33:33.939
I love it.

33:33.939 --> 33:38.773
That is high praise coming
from the famous Abby Porter.

33:38.773 --> 33:40.898
Not famous yet.

33:40.898 --> 33:43.732
And frankly at this point
it could go either way.

33:43.732 --> 33:45.148
Don't be so modest.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.106
You've built a good life
for yourself.

33:47.106 --> 33:49.857
A busy life.

33:49.857 --> 33:52.191
All work all the time.

33:52.191 --> 33:54.356
Well, some things never change.

33:54.356 --> 33:59.107
High school, class president
and honour roll, cheerleading,

33:59.107 --> 34:01.024
fashion club...

34:01.024 --> 34:03.732
I had forgotten
fashion club!

34:03.732 --> 34:05.899
No one had ever
even heard of that.

34:05.899 --> 34:08.982
Not until you started it.

34:08.982 --> 34:10.440
And 4H.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.565
Oh, well that's only
because my dad wanted me to.

34:13.565 --> 34:16.524
I tried my best
but I was hopeless.

34:16.524 --> 34:21.232
Well, you didn't wanna raise
livestock so much as dress them.

34:21.232 --> 34:24.940
I always wanted to make
my Dad proud.

34:24.940 --> 34:26.900
Never could.

34:26.900 --> 34:29.275
Even now, it's like he wants
to connect with me

34:29.275 --> 34:31.524
but he doesn't know how.

34:31.524 --> 34:34.108
Maybe I can help you
change that.

34:34.108 --> 34:36.690
What do you say?

34:36.690 --> 34:41.525
I say that would be a miracle.

34:41.525 --> 34:45.692
I propose a toast.

34:45.692 --> 34:48.442
To miracles.

34:59.734 --> 35:09.942
â™ª

35:09.942 --> 35:13.026
â™ª Ain't nothing fancy
'bout how I talk. â™ª

35:13.026 --> 35:16.651
â™ª It's a little bit slow
full of aint's and y'alls. â™ª

35:16.651 --> 35:20.067
â™ª Somewhere between some
old school straight and... â™ª

35:20.067 --> 35:23.443
Well, somebody's up
before the chickens.

35:23.443 --> 35:27.193
I figured it wasn't a bad idea
to get an early start.

35:27.193 --> 35:29.359
Even Dad's still asleep.

35:29.359 --> 35:31.401
How about some
French press coffee?

35:31.401 --> 35:33.943
Is everything French with you?

35:33.943 --> 35:35.568
Not everything.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.402
If you play your cards right
I might even whip up

35:37.402 --> 35:40.569
some German pancakes
to go along with it.

35:40.569 --> 35:42.068
Rain-cheque.

35:42.068 --> 35:43.985
Between the ranch and the house
these next couple days

35:43.985 --> 35:45.818
are gonna be busy enough.

35:45.818 --> 35:48.068
Ok, let's get to it.

35:48.943 --> 35:52.402
â™ª I can be your palm tree shade
in the middle of summer â™ª

35:52.402 --> 35:55.944
â™ª Your tin roof rain covered
from the thunder â™ª

35:55.944 --> 36:00.235
â™ª Your back pew hallelujah
Sunday morning prayer â™ª

36:00.235 --> 36:02.319
â™ª Yeah, I'll be where â™ª

36:02.319 --> 36:03.986
â™ª You can go when you know â™ª

36:03.986 --> 36:05.736
â™ª that it's all
spinning too fast. â™ª

36:05.736 --> 36:09.153
â™ª Slow kind of road,
35 on the dash â™ª

36:09.153 --> 36:11.236
â™ª A dot on the map
for your heart â™ª

36:11.236 --> 36:13.652
â™ª When you need to slow down â™ª

36:13.652 --> 36:15.195
â™ª You be my whole world â™ª

36:15.195 --> 36:17.778
â™ª I'll be your small town. â™ª

36:17.778 --> 36:21.944
â™ª

36:21.944 --> 36:25.069
â™ª You got me up all night
like New York City â™ª

36:25.069 --> 36:28.570
â™ª You got the Beverly high
heels, dressed kind of pretty. â™ª

36:28.570 --> 36:32.071
â™ª Every time I hold you,
I get to go there. â™ª

36:32.071 --> 36:36.695
â™ª When you want a little bit
of middle of nowhere. â™ª

36:36.695 --> 36:40.237
â™ª You can go when you know that
it's all spinning too fast â™ª

36:40.237 --> 36:43.570
â™ª Slow kind of road,
35 on the dash â™ª

36:43.570 --> 36:48.362
â™ª A dot on the map of your heart
when you need to slow down  â™ª

36:48.362 --> 36:55.738
â™ª You be my whole world,
I'll be your small town. â™ª

36:55.738 --> 37:02.571
â™ª Girl, you be
my whole world... â™ª

37:02.571 --> 37:06.321
â™ª And I be your
small town. â™ª

37:06.321 --> 37:09.654
[cows mooing]

37:09.654 --> 37:11.654
Go on.

37:15.447 --> 37:17.363
Shoulder ok, Dad?

37:17.363 --> 37:20.071
Oh yeah, better by the day.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.863
Don't you worry about me.

37:21.863 --> 37:22.655
Ryan.

37:22.655 --> 37:23.905
Yes sir.

37:23.905 --> 37:26.363
I need you in the north field
to check on the troughs.

37:26.363 --> 37:27.197
Alright.

37:27.197 --> 37:28.280
I'll get on it straight away.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.489
Good.

37:29.489 --> 37:31.071
And you know, after that I need
you to help me patch up

37:31.071 --> 37:33.363
that last stretch
of fence out back.

37:33.363 --> 37:35.447
Dad, what if I go check
the troughs.

37:35.447 --> 37:38.239
That way Ryan can stay and help
you fix the fence

37:38.239 --> 37:40.530
and make sure that
you don't overdo it.

37:40.530 --> 37:41.614
No, honey.

37:41.614 --> 37:43.323
It's a good idea, Wes.

37:43.323 --> 37:46.739
At least let me give it a try.

37:46.739 --> 37:51.531
We can get to the fence
that much quicker.

37:51.531 --> 37:54.281
It's been a while
since I've ridden a horse.

37:54.281 --> 37:56.698
I'm sure it's like
riding a bike.

37:56.698 --> 37:59.740
No, it's like riding a horse.

37:59.740 --> 38:02.364
Saddle her up.

38:08.032 --> 38:09.240
You sure about this?

38:09.240 --> 38:10.865
A chance to impress my father?

38:10.865 --> 38:11.907
Absolutely.

38:17.365 --> 38:18.240
Wait, Abby!

38:18.240 --> 38:18.740
Abby!

38:18.740 --> 38:19.948
North field!

38:19.948 --> 38:21.073
North.

38:21.073 --> 38:21.990
Oh yeah, north.

38:21.990 --> 38:23.574
I got it.

38:23.574 --> 38:25.574
[horse whinnies]

38:27.449 --> 38:29.407
You think we'll ever
see her again?

38:29.407 --> 38:30.616
Anybody's guess.

38:30.616 --> 38:33.574
She's not one to give up,
though.

38:33.574 --> 38:37.324
Pretty special kid,
don't you think?

38:37.324 --> 38:39.783
You tell her that?

38:52.908 --> 38:55.325
[sighs]

38:55.325 --> 38:58.033
I really miss this.

38:58.033 --> 38:59.617
Who knew?

39:00.408 --> 39:06.325
[phone ringing]

39:06.325 --> 39:07.575
Hello?

39:07.575 --> 39:08.742
Radio silence.

39:08.742 --> 39:11.075
What are you doing out there?

39:11.075 --> 39:13.075
Well, right now I'm
on the back of a horse

39:13.075 --> 39:17.075
looking at some of the most
beautiful land you've ever seen.

39:17.075 --> 39:18.409
How about you?

39:18.409 --> 39:21.034
Well, while you're playing Texas
Ranger we're shooting inserts

39:21.034 --> 39:23.992
for that show you wanted to do
about seashell wind chimes.

39:23.992 --> 39:26.242
These are all starting
to look the same to me.

39:26.242 --> 39:28.034
We spent the whole morning
collecting shells

39:28.034 --> 39:29.451
and driftwood off the beach.

39:29.451 --> 39:31.534
This is what it's coming to,
Abby.

39:31.534 --> 39:33.117
Beach-combing.

39:33.117 --> 39:35.743
At least if Carrington doesn't
see something new online soon.

39:35.743 --> 39:38.075
What can I tell him?

39:38.075 --> 39:40.242
How about the truth?

39:40.242 --> 39:41.076
Mmm.

39:41.076 --> 39:42.868
Other than that.

39:42.868 --> 39:45.659
Tell him... ugh, I don't know.

39:45.659 --> 39:48.743
Tell- tell him I'll have
something new in a day or two.

39:48.743 --> 39:50.659
I'll think of something.

39:50.659 --> 39:51.910
You better, because we've done

39:51.910 --> 39:54.826
just about everything here
we can do without you.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.826
Bye.

39:59.410 --> 40:00.577
Ready, buddy?

40:00.577 --> 40:03.076
Let's go. Good boy.

40:11.911 --> 40:14.119
Let's figure this out.

40:20.869 --> 40:22.744
What would Dad do?

40:24.077 --> 40:26.286
Wait a minute, what would I do?

40:39.286 --> 40:41.828
[water flowing]

40:58.496 --> 41:00.412
[grunts]

41:00.412 --> 41:01.579
How's it going, Dad?

41:01.579 --> 41:04.746
Ugh! I'm so tired of fightin'
with this thing!

41:04.746 --> 41:05.746
Your truck?

41:05.746 --> 41:07.746
No, this arm.

41:07.746 --> 41:11.412
I never felt so useless
in my entire life.

41:11.412 --> 41:14.038
Well, you've got
one problem solved.

41:14.038 --> 41:15.746
I fixed the trough
in the north field

41:15.746 --> 41:17.579
and a couple more
for good measure.

41:17.579 --> 41:20.245
Here's the proof.
Take a look.

41:20.245 --> 41:22.246
Take a look?

41:24.079 --> 41:25.371
Huh.

41:25.371 --> 41:27.413
Well, that oughta work.

41:27.413 --> 41:29.163
You know, for now anyway.

41:29.163 --> 41:32.788
That's quick thinkin'
on your...

41:32.788 --> 41:34.829
I got the wrong wrench.

41:34.829 --> 41:36.705
I need my toolbox.

41:46.914 --> 41:50.330
This place hasn't changed since,
what? Ninth grade?

41:50.330 --> 41:54.247
You ordered gelato
instead of ice cream.

41:54.247 --> 41:55.914
[laughing]

41:55.914 --> 41:57.705
I was so full of myself.

41:57.705 --> 41:58.789
[laughs]

41:58.789 --> 42:01.372
No, you had your own style,
that's for sure.

42:01.372 --> 42:06.080
And you turned it into a pretty
perfect lifestyle.

42:06.080 --> 42:11.164
Not so perfect.

42:11.164 --> 42:13.414
There's this guy.

42:13.414 --> 42:16.748
He owns a big chain of
home-goods stores

42:16.748 --> 42:18.539
all over the north east.

42:18.539 --> 42:21.081
He's interested in the show.

42:21.081 --> 42:24.247
He could get my merchandise
in all of his outlets.

42:24.247 --> 42:26.456
How is that not great news?

42:26.456 --> 42:28.248
You read my bio.

42:28.248 --> 42:31.248
He thinks I'm as New England
as my show.

42:31.248 --> 42:33.790
And this guy is all
about authenticity.

42:33.790 --> 42:35.956
Ah, the Greenwich thing.

42:35.956 --> 42:41.707
My manager blurted it out
and I got stuck with it.

42:41.707 --> 42:44.165
What're you gonna do?

42:44.165 --> 42:48.290
My mom sent me notes about
her childhood back there.

42:48.290 --> 42:51.248
Tapping maple trees,
beach parties...

42:51.248 --> 42:52.665
how can I borrow her memories

42:52.665 --> 42:55.624
without feeling like
a total fraud?

42:55.624 --> 42:57.457
So you reinvented yourself.

42:57.457 --> 42:59.124
That's a Texas tradition.

42:59.124 --> 43:00.707
You know, you may have
more Texas in you

43:00.707 --> 43:02.707
than you'd like to admit.

43:02.707 --> 43:04.624
Oh, do not let that get around.

43:04.624 --> 43:06.791
You know, you might even pass
for a local tonight

43:06.791 --> 43:09.249
at the barbecue.

43:09.249 --> 43:12.249
Last Friday of the month,
Fletcher's Barn.

43:12.249 --> 43:13.874
Is that still a thing?

43:13.874 --> 43:15.583
Oh, it's still a thing.

43:15.583 --> 43:18.792
[laughing]

43:18.792 --> 43:24.833
Maybe you'd like to go
with me.

43:24.833 --> 43:28.917
Maybe I would.

43:34.792 --> 43:37.125
You're overdressed
for a barbecue.

43:37.125 --> 43:40.042
You're underdressed
for a dinner party.

43:40.042 --> 43:41.917
You can't live in jeans.

43:41.917 --> 43:43.000
I don't see why not.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.542
I do.

43:44.542 --> 43:46.083
Hey, Ryan.

43:46.083 --> 43:47.334
Here you go.

43:47.334 --> 43:49.958
Spice things up a little.

43:49.958 --> 43:53.417
You know we always
count on you for this.

44:00.793 --> 44:02.709
Oh hey, I was hoping
to see you two.

44:02.709 --> 44:05.335
Ryan, tell me you brought
that barbecue sauce of yours.

44:05.335 --> 44:07.251
Just dropped it off,
enough for the crowd.

44:07.251 --> 44:08.418
Save me some?

44:08.418 --> 44:09.918
I'm having some friends in
from Dallas next week

44:09.918 --> 44:12.335
and I need to make
a good impression.

44:12.335 --> 44:14.460
I'll make sure he holds back
a jar for you.

44:14.460 --> 44:15.585
And Abby, what'd you bring?

44:15.585 --> 44:16.752
Clams on the half shell?

44:16.752 --> 44:18.084
Oysters Rockefeller?

44:18.084 --> 44:18.959
A salad.

44:18.959 --> 44:21.126
Kale, bok choy,
dandelion greens.

44:21.126 --> 44:24.084
With chia seed croutons?

44:24.084 --> 44:25.335
You watch my show?

44:25.335 --> 44:26.418
Never miss it.

44:26.418 --> 44:27.877
It's so good.

44:27.877 --> 44:29.668
Oh, hey, you think you could
help me with some decorations

44:29.668 --> 44:32.127
for the dance at the county fair
next week?

44:32.127 --> 44:34.252
You'll be there, right?

44:34.252 --> 44:36.794
I haven't been to a county fair
in years.

44:36.794 --> 44:38.377
Absolutely.

44:38.377 --> 44:39.919
Drinks.

44:39.919 --> 44:43.127
[laughs]

44:55.753 --> 44:59.628
Never thought we'd see Abby
back this way again.

44:59.628 --> 45:02.377
Yeah, she's helping out her dad
for a couple weeks.

45:02.377 --> 45:05.128
Oh, right. I heard
about the arm.

45:05.128 --> 45:08.253
Looks like she's
enjoying herself.

45:08.253 --> 45:13.170
[quietly chatting]

45:13.170 --> 45:15.378
Pickin' up where you left off?

45:15.378 --> 45:17.545
When we left off
we weren't speaking.

45:17.545 --> 45:19.420
And now?

45:20.003 --> 45:22.045
[laughing]

45:24.587 --> 45:26.587
We're speaking.

45:37.378 --> 45:39.213
I remember this.

45:39.213 --> 45:42.754
The smell of sage brush.

45:42.754 --> 45:44.712
I hadn't noticed it.

45:44.712 --> 45:48.421
I guess you don't appreciate
something until you lose it.

45:48.421 --> 45:51.630
I do miss these nights, though.

45:51.630 --> 45:53.797
The wide open sky.

45:53.797 --> 45:56.421
You always did have
two sides to you,

45:56.421 --> 45:57.922
city and country.

45:57.922 --> 45:59.671
I know, city may have won out

45:59.671 --> 46:02.588
but you've got some country
in you, too.

46:02.588 --> 46:06.254
Hey, everyone loves
your barbecue sauce.

46:06.254 --> 46:09.088
And you're trying
to make extra money.

46:09.088 --> 46:10.880
How about selling it?

46:10.880 --> 46:12.505
Yeah, I'll hop right on that.

46:12.505 --> 46:14.172
No joke.

46:14.172 --> 46:15.797
You should think about it.

46:15.797 --> 46:18.088
There's no question the demand
is there.

46:18.088 --> 46:21.422
I don't even know
where to start.

46:21.422 --> 46:23.297
I can help.

46:23.297 --> 46:25.047
Ryan, that's what I do.

46:25.047 --> 46:28.506
I find new products
and promote them.

46:28.506 --> 46:30.255
You could make this a thing.

46:30.255 --> 46:31.714
A brand.

46:31.714 --> 46:34.672
You can make money off of this.

46:39.798 --> 46:41.006
Growing up

46:41.006 --> 46:43.380
I spent a lot of time right here
on this old family porch

46:43.380 --> 46:46.089
with family and friends,
curled up with a good book

46:46.089 --> 46:48.507
and a glass of mint lemonade.

46:48.507 --> 46:52.089
Yes, right here where I grew up.

46:52.089 --> 46:54.756
On the old family porch.

46:54.756 --> 46:57.256
In Greenwich, Connecticut.

46:57.256 --> 46:59.423
Can we- can we just take
a minute here?

46:59.423 --> 47:00.882
Are you not getting it?

47:00.882 --> 47:02.590
No, I'm getting it.

47:02.590 --> 47:04.256
I just don't get it.

47:04.256 --> 47:07.840
Do you really think someone's
gonna buy this is New England?

47:07.840 --> 47:12.715
Uh, if you come in close
and don't show too much, maybe.

47:12.715 --> 47:15.299
I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

47:15.299 --> 47:16.757
I have to give this guy
something

47:16.757 --> 47:20.216
so he can show
his executive board.

47:20.216 --> 47:22.132
Yeah, you don't give up easy,
that's for sure.

47:22.132 --> 47:25.132
I know I can be overly
ambitious.

47:25.132 --> 47:29.341
It gets me into trouble.

47:29.341 --> 47:31.257
Do you really think there's
something special

47:31.257 --> 47:32.633
in that barbecue sauce?

47:32.633 --> 47:35.591
Like, something commercial?

47:35.591 --> 47:37.424
You'll never know until you try.

47:37.424 --> 47:39.716
I could help.

47:39.716 --> 47:41.716
If you want, no pressure.

47:41.716 --> 47:46.217
I mean it.

47:52.716 --> 47:55.592
It's a bit obvious, isn't it?

47:55.592 --> 47:58.342
Well, you have to settle
on something.

47:58.342 --> 48:01.342
You need a label.

48:01.342 --> 48:05.509
What about a yellow rose?

48:05.509 --> 48:07.717
A yellow rose.

48:07.717 --> 48:09.759
That sure says Texas.

48:10.926 --> 48:11.884
Ryan?

48:11.884 --> 48:13.550
Abby?

48:13.550 --> 48:16.218
I hate to interrupt
your work there,

48:16.218 --> 48:19.218
but did you get
today's list done?

48:19.218 --> 48:20.467
Already ahead of you, Dad.

48:20.467 --> 48:22.134
The cows have been fed
and milked.

48:22.134 --> 48:23.592
And the herd's been moved
from the pasture.

48:23.592 --> 48:26.259
Well, that just leaves the west
gate that needs fixin'.

48:26.259 --> 48:30.134
And Ryan, I need you to bring
the tractor in from the pasture.

48:30.134 --> 48:31.259
Yes sir.

48:31.259 --> 48:31.926
Ok.

48:31.926 --> 48:32.760
I can do that.

48:32.760 --> 48:34.967
Dad, I can drive the tractor.

48:34.967 --> 48:37.259
You've been doing too much
around here lately

48:37.259 --> 48:39.676
and I appreciate it but...

48:39.676 --> 48:42.426
how about we get the gate
fixed, first.

48:42.426 --> 48:44.676
And then we can discuss it?

48:47.760 --> 48:49.551
Sure.

48:49.551 --> 48:51.426
Then we can discuss it.

48:55.469 --> 48:57.052
Did you hear that?

48:57.052 --> 48:58.760
He appreciates me.

48:58.760 --> 49:00.427
And we can discuss it.

49:00.427 --> 49:01.511
Two for two.

49:01.511 --> 49:02.636
(Both) Progress.

49:02.636 --> 49:04.302
[laughs]

49:13.385 --> 49:15.594
Yeah, keep holding it up for me.

49:17.761 --> 49:19.053
Do you think he meant that?

49:19.053 --> 49:21.594
That we can discuss me
driving the tractor?

49:21.594 --> 49:24.969
Well, I told you
we'd wear him down.

49:29.094 --> 49:31.011
Here's what I think.

49:31.011 --> 49:35.261
He loves this ranch and he
just wants you to love it, too.

49:35.261 --> 49:36.553
But I do.

49:36.553 --> 49:41.929
I always did, just... maybe
not the way he wanted me to.

49:41.929 --> 49:43.261
Give it a try.

49:44.261 --> 49:45.637
[squeaking]

49:45.637 --> 49:46.595
Nope.

49:46.595 --> 49:48.637
Not quite. Not quite.

49:51.095 --> 49:53.304
Let me try something.

49:53.304 --> 49:55.762
What? What're you doing?

49:55.762 --> 49:57.304
The lunch I packed.

49:58.221 --> 49:59.720
Caprese salad.

49:59.720 --> 50:00.929
Sounds delicious,

50:00.929 --> 50:02.720
but I don't see how a packed
lunch is gonna help us.

50:02.720 --> 50:05.304
Tomatoes, mozzarella, basil.

50:05.304 --> 50:06.346
And...

50:09.054 --> 50:11.137
Olive oil.

50:11.137 --> 50:13.596
You travel with your
own olive oil?

50:13.596 --> 50:14.763
Who does that?

50:14.763 --> 50:17.262
Someone who doesn't like
soggy tomatoes.

50:17.262 --> 50:19.471
I did a whole show
about that once.

50:19.471 --> 50:21.346
Ok.

50:31.138 --> 50:33.555
Alright.

50:36.597 --> 50:37.555
Ready?

50:37.555 --> 50:39.180
Alright.

50:40.055 --> 50:42.096
Ah, voila.

50:42.096 --> 50:42.806
[laughs]

50:42.806 --> 50:43.430
Ok, alright.

50:43.430 --> 50:44.930
-That's...
-Yep.

50:44.930 --> 50:46.180
That's a new one for me.

50:46.180 --> 50:48.388
That's my job and I love it.

50:48.388 --> 50:51.889
Helpful hacks for making
life easier.

50:51.889 --> 50:55.263
Ryan, I know your heart
is in Texas.

50:55.263 --> 50:57.597
Langston is beautiful.

50:57.597 --> 51:00.764
You know, part of my heart
is here, too,

51:00.764 --> 51:03.431
but... it's so quiet.

51:03.431 --> 51:07.264
Don't you ever feel
restless here?

51:07.264 --> 51:10.139
What, do you think there's
nothing to do around here?

51:10.139 --> 51:12.181
You might be surprised.

51:12.181 --> 51:13.431
Oh yeah?

51:13.431 --> 51:14.640
Surprise me.

51:14.640 --> 51:16.473
Ok, that sounds like
a challenge.

51:16.473 --> 51:19.223
It is.

51:19.223 --> 51:21.097
You remember the old
Garrett place?

51:21.097 --> 51:23.264
The old goat ranch?

51:23.264 --> 51:26.140
Sure, but I've seen it,
you know?

51:26.140 --> 51:30.640
Ah, you might find
it's been built up a bit.

51:30.640 --> 51:31.640
Come on.

51:31.640 --> 51:32.681
Ok.

51:45.808 --> 51:47.973
We specialize in
Cabernet Sauvignon

51:47.973 --> 51:53.599
but we have several popular
varietals these days.

51:53.599 --> 51:54.891
Carmen, I'm speechless.

51:54.891 --> 51:57.099
Which doesn't happen often.

51:57.099 --> 51:58.641
I remember you from school.

51:58.641 --> 51:59.933
You were a couple years
behind me

51:59.933 --> 52:02.766
but everyone knew
what a talker you were.

52:02.766 --> 52:04.933
And now here's the best part
of our tour.

52:04.933 --> 52:05.933
And what's that?

52:05.933 --> 52:07.933
The tasting.

52:10.724 --> 52:12.600
Over the past couple years
we've expanded to sales

52:12.600 --> 52:15.475
all across the state
and we just keep growing.

52:15.475 --> 52:16.767
You're amazing.

52:16.767 --> 52:19.308
Look who's talking,
Miss Internet Star.

52:19.308 --> 52:22.058
This is just my little home-spun
thing by comparison.

52:22.058 --> 52:23.225
Not at all.

52:23.225 --> 52:24.892
And that bottling room
in the back?

52:24.892 --> 52:26.059
Whew.

52:26.059 --> 52:27.475
Everything's done on premises.

52:27.475 --> 52:29.642
We keep our staff hopping,
that's for sure.

52:29.642 --> 52:31.391
I bet you could bottle all sorts
of things

52:31.391 --> 52:33.934
if someone needed to do that.

52:33.934 --> 52:35.100
Abby.

52:35.100 --> 52:38.100
What? I'm just saying.

52:38.100 --> 52:41.267
I hate to run but my buyers
from Austin have just pulled in.

52:41.267 --> 52:42.559
Welcome home, Abby,

52:42.559 --> 52:44.601
and I hope to see you both
at the fair this weekend.

52:44.601 --> 52:46.392
You will.

52:48.142 --> 52:52.726
You gotta admit, a lotta change
happening around here.

52:52.726 --> 52:54.309
Plenty of change.

52:54.309 --> 52:56.476
In fact, it's inspiring.

52:59.101 --> 53:01.267
Ryan, what's the big mystery?

53:01.267 --> 53:03.267
Hang on, we're almost there.

53:03.267 --> 53:05.601
Almost where?

53:05.601 --> 53:07.393
You gotta see this yourself.

53:07.393 --> 53:08.684
See what?

53:08.684 --> 53:09.851
Wait, is something wrong?

53:09.851 --> 53:11.935
Is it- is it Abby?

53:11.935 --> 53:13.726
Oh, it's Abby.

53:15.268 --> 53:20.101
[tractor engine running]

53:21.727 --> 53:22.727
Huh.

53:26.560 --> 53:28.602
Like a pro.

53:29.852 --> 53:32.144
Hey Dad!

53:32.144 --> 53:35.228
[laughs]

53:39.727 --> 53:41.727
Well I'll be.

54:01.394 --> 54:02.895
[knocking]

54:04.020 --> 54:05.103
Hey Dad.

54:05.103 --> 54:06.686
Did you need something.

54:06.686 --> 54:13.187
Just to tell you...
good work today.

54:13.187 --> 54:14.770
Not half bad.

54:14.770 --> 54:16.937
No, better.

54:16.937 --> 54:20.437
Not bad at all.

54:20.437 --> 54:22.354
You get some rest now.

54:22.354 --> 54:24.103
You too, Dad.

54:24.103 --> 54:25.771
Thanks, sweetie.

54:30.270 --> 54:33.854
[cows mooing]

54:36.562 --> 54:38.230
Smells like barbecue.

54:38.230 --> 54:40.230
Looks like barbecue.

54:40.230 --> 54:41.395
I appreciate the interest y'all,

54:41.395 --> 54:43.271
but could you give me
a little stirring space?

54:43.271 --> 54:44.521
A little elbow room?

54:44.521 --> 54:46.438
Yeah. Absolutely.

54:46.438 --> 54:49.271
Uh, you really think this old
recipe might be worth something?

54:49.271 --> 54:51.729
We'll put a few bottles out
for sale at the fair tonight

54:51.729 --> 54:53.605
and see what happens.

54:53.605 --> 54:56.772
I mean, if we like the reaction
then I'll call my publicist,

54:56.772 --> 54:58.938
see if we can get it
on a national market.

54:58.938 --> 55:00.730
Oh, that's awful ambitious.

55:00.730 --> 55:02.188
Abby's got me thinkin' big.

55:02.188 --> 55:03.355
Careful, Ryan.

55:03.355 --> 55:06.897
Next she'll have you packin' up
and movin' east.

55:06.897 --> 55:08.814
You gotta tell me
what you think, Wes.

55:08.814 --> 55:10.522
Honest opinion.

55:12.605 --> 55:13.730
Mmm.

55:13.730 --> 55:16.105
Like a mouthful of Texas.

55:16.105 --> 55:17.439
That's good!

55:17.439 --> 55:19.105
We could use that
in the advertising.

55:19.105 --> 55:20.147
What advertising?

55:20.147 --> 55:22.688
Oh, I might be jumping
the gun a little,

55:22.688 --> 55:25.689
again, but that's
a good line, Dad.

55:25.689 --> 55:28.648
You're a natural at sales.

55:28.648 --> 55:29.939
Maybe.

55:29.939 --> 55:32.773
But for now I should- I should
probably stick to ranchin'.

55:32.773 --> 55:36.147
[chickens clucking]

55:36.147 --> 55:37.773
What's going on out there?

55:37.773 --> 55:38.731
You need a hand?

55:38.731 --> 55:41.564
Nothing I can't handle.
Hey...

55:41.564 --> 55:43.106
Well, when you're finished
with this,

55:43.106 --> 55:45.106
Carmen said that she'd loan us
her packing room

55:45.106 --> 55:46.564
for our first run.

55:46.564 --> 55:47.856
A few hundred bottles.

55:47.856 --> 55:49.315
How much is this costing us?

55:49.315 --> 55:50.940
Well, the labels are
from my laptop

55:50.940 --> 55:53.731
and the bottles only cost
a few cents a piece.

55:53.731 --> 55:57.273
As far as start-up goes
this is pocket change.

55:57.273 --> 56:01.023
[phone rings]

56:01.023 --> 56:03.899
Oh, it's my manager.

56:06.232 --> 56:07.440
Um... hey!

56:07.440 --> 56:08.732
Abby, hi!

56:08.732 --> 56:11.690
Mr. Carrington's here and
he'd like to speak with you.

56:11.690 --> 56:15.274
Video call so he can see you.

56:15.274 --> 56:16.899
In Greenwich.

56:16.899 --> 56:20.149
Here, in Greenwich.

56:20.149 --> 56:23.483
Um... any way
we can postpone?

56:23.483 --> 56:26.732
Like I said he's right here.

56:29.441 --> 56:30.274
Oh, Abby! Abby!

56:30.274 --> 56:32.107
Apron.

56:36.274 --> 56:37.775
Hey, Mr. Carrington!

56:37.775 --> 56:39.025
How are you?

56:39.025 --> 56:40.025
Good.

56:40.025 --> 56:42.025
Uh, hope I'm not intruding
on family time.

56:42.025 --> 56:45.733
I'm picturing cocktails
by the water?

56:45.733 --> 56:46.942
That's a good guess.

56:46.942 --> 56:53.775
Just back from a whole day
of uh... croquet.

56:53.775 --> 56:56.400
Just about to mix up a pitcher
of Cape Cods.

56:56.400 --> 56:57.691
Croquet and Cape Cods.

56:57.691 --> 56:59.192
Does it get any more authentic
than that?

56:59.192 --> 57:02.775
See, this is why we are excited
about you.

57:02.775 --> 57:05.067
So I like the piece you did
on the porch,

57:05.067 --> 57:07.275
but all we saw was the porch.

57:07.275 --> 57:10.150
Um, we need more
Connecticut scenery.

(Wes) Abby, there's chickens
all over the place!

57:15.359 --> 57:18.193
Didn't you check the pen
this mornin'?

57:18.193 --> 57:21.109
Um... I'm on the phone, Dad.

57:21.109 --> 57:23.609
I'm sorry, did someone
say chickens?

57:23.609 --> 57:25.401
Uh, Bridgeport Bantams.

57:25.401 --> 57:27.318
Connecticut's finest.

57:27.318 --> 57:29.109
Bridgeport what?

57:30.859 --> 57:33.901
And apparently they're
all over the croquet lawn.

57:33.901 --> 57:35.485
I hate to run but...

57:35.485 --> 57:38.943
Before you go, uh, when will
we see those new episodes?

Very, very soon.

Don't let me down.

Does that fella not know
where you are?

58:04.777 --> 58:07.277
It's a long story, Dad.

And honestly I do not want

Yellow Rose.

59:03.363 --> 59:05.363
It's made right here
in Langston.

59:05.363 --> 59:06.946
It's like a mouthful of Texas.

Tell your friends.

What did I tell you?

59:18.488 --> 59:20.112
We had 40 cases.

Now this is all we have left.

hey, I don't need it anymore.

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:40.293
Look at that.

01:06:40.293 --> 01:06:41.335
Are you sure that's ok?

01:06:41.335 --> 01:06:42.544
Oh yeah.

should look at that?

than he does.

around here anymore.

Well, you can stay
as long as you want.

your barbecue sauce.

01:07:23.128 --> 01:07:24.837
Did Carrington taste it?

01:07:24.837 --> 01:07:26.003
Did he like it?

01:07:26.003 --> 01:07:28.378
He loved it, but he wondered
where you found that

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:29.628
in Greenwich.

01:07:29.628 --> 01:07:30.711
I mean, Yellow Rose?

01:07:30.711 --> 01:07:31.753
Please.

01:07:31.753 --> 01:07:33.128
What did you tell him?

01:07:33.128 --> 01:07:34.628
I didn't have to tell
him anything.

01:07:34.628 --> 01:07:36.795
One of your fans posted
on your website

01:07:36.795 --> 01:07:38.753
that you were in Langston.

01:07:38.753 --> 01:07:40.420
Carrington started digging...

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.671
How deep did he dig?

01:07:42.671 --> 01:07:46.504
All the way to Texas.

01:07:46.504 --> 01:07:47.587
Fine.

01:07:47.587 --> 01:07:48.963
So it's out there.

01:07:48.963 --> 01:07:50.629
Honestly, I'm relieved.

01:07:50.629 --> 01:07:52.462
We should have just levelled
with him from the start.

01:07:52.462 --> 01:07:57.046
I admit some part of this
may have been my fault.

01:07:57.046 --> 01:07:58.046
Some part?

01:07:58.046 --> 01:08:00.171
Ok, now isn't the time
to point fingers.

01:08:00.171 --> 01:08:03.380
I still think we can fix this
but not long distance.

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.171
This is a face-to-face problem.

01:08:05.171 --> 01:08:07.129
You need to get here.

01:08:07.129 --> 01:08:08.171
How soon?

01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:11.463
In a language you'll understand
these days?

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:12.796
Pronto.

01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:22.964
Is Ryan coming in today?

01:08:22.964 --> 01:08:24.129
Well, he should be.

01:08:24.129 --> 01:08:25.130
I haven't heard from him yet.

01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:26.255
Is something wrong?

01:08:26.255 --> 01:08:28.964
Gina needs me in Connecticut.

01:08:28.964 --> 01:08:31.130
Ryan needs me here.

01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:34.046
Everybody needs ya.

01:08:34.046 --> 01:08:36.130
Not everybody.

01:08:37.464 --> 01:08:38.964
Why would you say that?

01:08:38.964 --> 01:08:43.421
Because everything is coming
apart and I'm just confused

01:08:43.421 --> 01:08:46.296
and I don't even know
what to say.

01:08:46.296 --> 01:08:47.589
Honey.

01:08:47.589 --> 01:08:52.714
Everything I've ever done
I did to make you proud, Dad.

01:08:52.714 --> 01:08:56.421
Somehow it's never been enough.

01:08:56.421 --> 01:09:00.048
Is that what you really think?

01:09:00.048 --> 01:09:05.840
I mean... all these years?

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.381
Let me show you somethin'.

01:09:08.381 --> 01:09:09.840
Come on.

01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:35.799
All these old photos?

01:09:35.799 --> 01:09:40.466
You think I don't
appreciate you?

01:09:40.466 --> 01:09:41.756
Abby.

01:09:41.756 --> 01:09:47.131
You- you came all this way
to help out even though I know

01:09:47.131 --> 01:09:50.216
you're not much happier here
than your mama was.

01:09:50.216 --> 01:09:52.133
What do you mean?

01:09:52.133 --> 01:09:55.049
When we married I asked
your mama to move here

01:09:55.049 --> 01:09:57.174
hoping she'd take to ranchin'.

01:09:57.174 --> 01:10:00.341
Just like I hoped
you would, too.

01:10:03.716 --> 01:10:05.967
But you are your own person,
you see?

01:10:05.967 --> 01:10:08.424
And I saw that.

01:10:08.424 --> 01:10:11.758
I always thought you were
disappointed in me.

01:10:11.758 --> 01:10:12.633
Oh, no.

01:10:12.633 --> 01:10:14.883
I mean it was clear
from the start

01:10:14.883 --> 01:10:17.967
you were never gonna be
a rancher.

01:10:17.967 --> 01:10:21.342
But honey, if you thought
for one second

01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:24.801
I was ever disappointed
in you...

01:10:24.801 --> 01:10:28.843
well, we got ourselves a
Texas-sized misunderstanding

01:10:28.843 --> 01:10:30.051
on our hands.

01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:32.634
It's my fault, 'cause I had
never been, you know,

01:10:32.634 --> 01:10:36.134
the... the kind of fella
who could, you know,

01:10:36.134 --> 01:10:41.009
talk about his feelin's
and such.

01:10:41.009 --> 01:10:43.218
I need to show you this.

01:10:58.093 --> 01:11:01.093
All these old photos.

01:11:01.093 --> 01:11:02.593
All these clippings.

01:11:02.593 --> 01:11:03.802
Yeah.

01:11:03.802 --> 01:11:04.969
Even I haven't seen
some of these.

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:06.927
I've been keepin' 'em
for years.

01:11:06.927 --> 01:11:11.302
Showing them off to anyone
who would listen.

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:20.302
Honey, I have always been
so very, very proud of you.

01:11:20.969 --> 01:11:22.302
You have?

01:11:22.302 --> 01:11:23.344
Sure.

01:11:23.344 --> 01:11:26.678
You were cut out for big things
in this world.

01:11:26.678 --> 01:11:30.636
When you were a little girl
you took after your mama.

01:11:30.636 --> 01:11:32.261
You decorated your room like-

01:11:32.261 --> 01:11:35.594
like it was a palace and then
you dressed like a princess.

01:11:35.594 --> 01:11:40.136
You see, that you got
from your mama.

01:11:40.136 --> 01:11:43.636
But you're stubborn,
like me.

01:11:43.636 --> 01:11:44.845
Ambitious, too.

01:11:44.845 --> 01:11:48.136
You go after what you want.

01:11:48.136 --> 01:11:52.387
Darlin', you're a combination
of your mama and me

01:11:52.387 --> 01:11:58.262
and as far as I'm concerned
that makes you perfect.

01:11:58.262 --> 01:12:01.303
I love you so very much, honey.

01:12:01.303 --> 01:12:04.136
I love you, too, Dad.

01:12:12.846 --> 01:12:14.137
[cows mooing]

01:12:14.137 --> 01:12:16.263
Wes said you needed to see me.

01:12:20.762 --> 01:12:23.929
Everything is falling apart
back east.

01:12:23.929 --> 01:12:26.804
I have to go home and pull it
all back together.

01:12:26.804 --> 01:12:29.596
So you're leavin'.

01:12:29.596 --> 01:12:33.012
Tomorrow morning.

01:12:33.012 --> 01:12:36.013
We both knew I had to
eventually.

01:12:36.013 --> 01:12:37.429
At first, sure.

01:12:37.429 --> 01:12:42.139
But, I don't know,
I thought we were...

01:12:42.139 --> 01:12:45.471
We were what?

01:12:45.471 --> 01:12:46.721
I don't know.

01:12:46.721 --> 01:12:48.805
For some reason I thought
we had a new understanding.

01:12:48.805 --> 01:12:51.139
This is my job, Ryan.

01:12:51.139 --> 01:12:52.430
This is my life.

01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:53.721
And that life isn't here.

01:12:53.721 --> 01:12:55.805
Got it. Yeah.

01:12:55.805 --> 01:12:58.264
This is the same conversation
we had years ago.

01:12:58.264 --> 01:13:00.389
What am I supposed to do?

01:13:00.389 --> 01:13:04.347
I have to get back there
as soon as I can.

01:13:04.347 --> 01:13:06.931
What do you want?

01:13:09.389 --> 01:13:14.014
Honestly, I'm not
even sure anymore.

01:13:14.014 --> 01:13:16.389
Well, that's too bad.

01:13:16.389 --> 01:13:18.639
Because I'm very sure of us

01:13:18.639 --> 01:13:21.098
and I was hopin' you were, too.

01:13:21.098 --> 01:13:23.556
Sure of me, at least.

01:13:23.556 --> 01:13:27.473
I'm in a really tough position.

01:13:27.473 --> 01:13:28.473
I don't have a choice.

01:13:28.473 --> 01:13:30.682
You always have a choice, Abby.

01:13:30.682 --> 01:13:34.723
You just have to have
the courage to make it.

01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:41.765
Me, I've decided to sell
the house.

01:13:42.557 --> 01:13:44.473
The offer was too good
to pass up.

01:13:44.473 --> 01:13:48.057
It was more than I was asking,
thanks to you.

01:13:48.057 --> 01:13:53.807
Ralph's bringing the papers
by tomorrow.

01:13:53.807 --> 01:13:55.140
I can finally make
that down payment

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.849
on some land outside of town.

01:13:57.849 --> 01:14:00.349
I'll be just fine.

01:14:00.349 --> 01:14:02.890
That's something
I never doubted.

01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:04.849
So this is it.

01:14:04.849 --> 01:14:07.558
Well, we had a good run.

01:14:07.558 --> 01:14:11.558
Twice.

01:14:11.558 --> 01:14:13.266
Like the first time,

01:14:13.266 --> 01:14:17.016
I wish you nothing but
the best in the world.

01:14:26.641 --> 01:14:28.141
We can't leave it this way!

01:14:28.141 --> 01:14:30.225
Sure we can.

01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:37.100
Truth is I should have moved on
a long time ago

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:38.475
and I truly thought I had.

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:41.058
But these last couple weeks
I let my guard down

01:14:41.058 --> 01:14:43.183
and I fell in love with you
all over again.

01:14:43.183 --> 01:14:45.517
Nope.

01:14:45.517 --> 01:14:48.308
That's not it.

01:14:48.308 --> 01:14:51.267
I never stopped loving you.

01:14:52.475 --> 01:14:53.851
Ryan.

01:14:53.851 --> 01:14:55.517
Goodbye, Abby.

01:14:55.517 --> 01:14:57.934
[starts engine]

01:15:10.017 --> 01:15:11.726
You've reached Gina Mosley
Productions.

01:15:11.726 --> 01:15:15.351
Leave a message and
I'll get back to you.

01:15:15.351 --> 01:15:16.309
[beep]

01:15:16.309 --> 01:15:17.977
Gina, I've been trying
to reach you.

01:15:17.977 --> 01:15:19.560
Where are you?

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.226
Call me.

01:15:26.434 --> 01:15:29.143
I hate to see you go, Abby.

01:15:29.143 --> 01:15:31.060
Me too, Dad.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.352
But I have to.

01:15:32.352 --> 01:15:34.561
How'd you leave things
with Ryan?

01:15:34.561 --> 01:15:36.018
Not good.

01:15:37.602 --> 01:15:41.602
I thought you two had
a real chance this time.

01:15:41.602 --> 01:15:43.811
My show's in New England.

01:15:43.811 --> 01:15:47.185
I thought the internet
was everywhere these days.

01:15:47.185 --> 01:15:53.310
It is, but New England
is only in New England.

01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:55.310
I'm gonna miss you.

01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:57.769
I'm gonna miss you, too,
honey.

01:16:01.353 --> 01:16:02.395
[car approaching]

01:16:02.395 --> 01:16:04.144
Hmm.

01:16:04.144 --> 01:16:06.270
Looks like we have a visitor.

01:16:13.144 --> 01:16:14.311
Jacob?

01:16:14.311 --> 01:16:16.311
What in the world...

01:16:16.311 --> 01:16:18.061
It's not just me.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.979
So, this is Texas.

01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:27.062
Is this why I couldn't reach you
at the studio?

01:16:28.812 --> 01:16:30.478
Mr. Carrington.

01:16:30.478 --> 01:16:32.979
Hi, Abby.

01:16:32.979 --> 01:16:34.728
I'm so confused.

01:16:34.728 --> 01:16:36.895
I told you he loved
the Yellow Rose.

01:16:36.895 --> 01:16:38.145
And I do.

01:16:38.145 --> 01:16:39.979
And, ok, he was a
little disappointed

01:16:39.979 --> 01:16:43.396
you weren't as authentically
New England as you'd let on-

01:16:43.396 --> 01:16:46.020
Gina.

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:49.312
As... I let on.

01:16:49.312 --> 01:16:50.604
My bad, I admit it.

01:16:50.604 --> 01:16:52.521
I'm a terrible person.

01:16:52.521 --> 01:16:54.563
But I still like your style.

01:16:54.563 --> 01:16:56.479
And I think you have
a wealth of knowledge

01:16:56.479 --> 01:16:58.396
and I would hate to see
that go to waste.

01:16:58.396 --> 01:17:00.479
Your Taste of Texas idea?

01:17:00.479 --> 01:17:01.563
He loves it.

01:17:01.563 --> 01:17:03.396
He wants to expand his company.

01:17:03.396 --> 01:17:04.813
We're always looking
for the chance

01:17:04.813 --> 01:17:08.980
to take our brand national
if it's authentic.

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:11.230
Oh, it's authentic.

01:17:11.230 --> 01:17:13.605
This is where I come from.

01:17:13.605 --> 01:17:16.313
These are my roots.

01:17:16.313 --> 01:17:18.105
My real roots.

01:17:18.105 --> 01:17:22.105
This is my barn, my cows,
my chickens...

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:24.772
and this is my dad.

01:17:24.772 --> 01:17:26.939
Wes Porter.

01:17:26.939 --> 01:17:28.313
Howdy.

01:17:28.313 --> 01:17:31.480
You the fellow who's been givin'
my little girl all the trouble?

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.480
Well, I think it's the other
way around,

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:35.231
but uh, I'm not here to argue.

01:17:35.231 --> 01:17:36.147
[laughs]

01:17:36.147 --> 01:17:37.856
Fair enough.

01:17:37.856 --> 01:17:40.897
We could have done
all of this on the phone.

01:17:40.897 --> 01:17:42.981
What're you guys doing here?

01:17:42.981 --> 01:17:44.689
We're here to shoot the pilot.

01:17:44.689 --> 01:17:48.022
Jacob's got the equipment
and you've got the location.

01:17:48.022 --> 01:17:49.398
And I've got the money.

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:52.565
Oh, don't you just love
the sound of that?

01:17:52.565 --> 01:17:54.815
Jacob, go find some
good angles.

01:17:54.815 --> 01:17:55.815
Think scope.

01:17:55.815 --> 01:17:57.523
Right, Mr. Carrington?

01:17:57.523 --> 01:18:00.648
We want scope.

01:18:00.648 --> 01:18:01.648
Well, what're you waiting for?

01:18:01.648 --> 01:18:03.565
Go change!

01:18:07.148 --> 01:18:08.232
I love this.

01:18:08.232 --> 01:18:09.399
-This is fantastic.
-It's perfect, isn't it?

01:18:09.399 --> 01:18:10.357
The lot.

01:18:10.357 --> 01:18:11.606
This is exactly what
we're looking for.

01:18:12.815 --> 01:18:14.731
Scope.

01:18:14.731 --> 01:18:16.566
And action!

01:18:17.524 --> 01:18:18.982
Don't adjust your screens.

01:18:18.982 --> 01:18:20.982
"New England My Way" is moving.

01:18:20.982 --> 01:18:23.816
We're live streaming today
all the way from my home town,

01:18:23.816 --> 01:18:25.816
Langston, Texas.

01:18:25.816 --> 01:18:28.399
This is where I was
born and raised.

01:18:28.399 --> 01:18:30.816
This is the land
that I know best.

01:18:30.816 --> 01:18:32.774
Better than the beaches
of Cape Cod

01:18:32.774 --> 01:18:35.274
or the maple forests of Vermont.

01:18:36.024 --> 01:18:37.191
[ringing]

01:18:37.191 --> 01:18:39.983
And together we're going
to explore it all.

01:18:39.983 --> 01:18:43.441
[phone ringing]

01:18:43.441 --> 01:18:44.607
Hey, hello.

01:18:44.607 --> 01:18:45.483
Ryan?

01:18:45.483 --> 01:18:47.108
It's Janet Miller.

01:18:47.108 --> 01:18:49.358
There's something
you need to see.

01:18:49.358 --> 01:18:50.483
Ok, uh yeah.

01:18:50.483 --> 01:18:51.899
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

01:18:51.899 --> 01:18:52.983
Just need your signature
on these pages

01:18:52.983 --> 01:18:54.149
and we'll get things rollin'.

01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.899
Yeah.

01:18:54.899 --> 01:18:55.900
Can I call you back?

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:56.983
You could but it might be
too late.

01:18:56.983 --> 01:18:58.733
Are you near your computer?

01:18:59.233 --> 01:19:01.608
A friend reminded me recently
just how amazing

01:19:01.608 --> 01:19:03.525
this part of the country is.

01:19:03.525 --> 01:19:05.150
How much it has to offer.

01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:09.276
Well, it turns out my heart
is here in more ways than one,

01:19:09.276 --> 01:19:11.650
and sometimes you just have
to follow it.

01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:14.317
The sky goes on forever here.

01:19:14.317 --> 01:19:18.692
The air is filled with the smell
of wild flowers and sage brush.

01:19:18.692 --> 01:19:20.484
There's just nothing like it.

01:19:20.484 --> 01:19:22.276
That's Abby Porter,
isn't it?

01:19:22.276 --> 01:19:23.651
What's she talking about,
her heart?

01:19:23.651 --> 01:19:25.276
I don't know but I need
to find out.

01:19:25.276 --> 01:19:27.192
It got me so excited
that I wanted to share it

01:19:27.192 --> 01:19:28.651
with all of you.

01:19:28.651 --> 01:19:30.609
So it's time to
get reacquainted,

01:19:30.609 --> 01:19:32.693
and in my mind there's
no better way to do that

01:19:32.693 --> 01:19:34.442
than over barbecue.

01:19:34.442 --> 01:19:36.609
Ribs and lobster.

01:19:36.609 --> 01:19:38.484
New England, meet Texas.

01:19:38.484 --> 01:19:40.985
Texas surf 'n' turf.

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:41.693
Woah, Ryan.

01:19:41.693 --> 01:19:43.068
The contract.

01:19:43.068 --> 01:19:45.484
Just leave it on the table and
lock up when you're done, ok?

01:19:47.527 --> 01:19:49.151
And we're out.

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:50.569
That was brilliant.

01:19:50.569 --> 01:19:53.776
So easy, so natural, and that
sauce is a product I can sell.

01:19:53.776 --> 01:19:55.985
So do we have a deal?

01:19:55.985 --> 01:19:58.652
As long as we agree to
all be entirely truthful

01:19:58.652 --> 01:20:00.318
from this point on.

01:20:00.318 --> 01:20:02.402
Cross my Texas heart.

01:20:02.944 --> 01:20:06.069
I didn't tell you that
my grandfather was
from Texas, did I?

01:20:06.069 --> 01:20:07.277
No.

01:20:07.277 --> 01:20:10.318
He's not, I just wanted to make
sure I didn't say it.

01:20:10.318 --> 01:20:12.485
I think we both better keep
our eye on this one.

01:20:12.485 --> 01:20:13.485
[laughs]

01:20:13.485 --> 01:20:14.819
This lemonade is terrific,
by the way.

01:20:14.819 --> 01:20:15.652
Mmm.

01:20:15.652 --> 01:20:17.236
It's bottled just
down the road.

01:20:17.236 --> 01:20:19.486
Fresh local lemons.

01:20:19.486 --> 01:20:21.361
Might make a show on its own,
you think?

01:20:21.361 --> 01:20:23.819
That I will leave up
to your daughter.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.528
Yeah, smart man.

01:20:26.777 --> 01:20:28.069
[truck approaching]

01:20:28.069 --> 01:20:30.986
(Wes) We haven't had this much
traffic here in years.

01:20:46.570 --> 01:20:48.695
Uh, can we- can
we talk a minute?

01:20:59.153 --> 01:21:01.696
Is that the old boyfriend?

01:21:01.696 --> 01:21:03.529
Yep.

01:21:03.529 --> 01:21:05.946
And I'm hoping the new one.

01:21:08.946 --> 01:21:12.487
I uh, I was watching your show
just now,

01:21:12.487 --> 01:21:14.071
Yellow Rose and all.

01:21:14.071 --> 01:21:15.487
What's going on?

01:21:15.487 --> 01:21:16.946
My plans changed.

01:21:16.946 --> 01:21:18.904
I'm not going anywhere.

01:21:18.904 --> 01:21:20.654
What about New England your way?

01:21:20.654 --> 01:21:21.988
[laughs]

01:21:21.988 --> 01:21:25.696
The great thing about a website
is you can run it from anywhere.

01:21:25.696 --> 01:21:28.321
My dad reminded me of that.

01:21:28.321 --> 01:21:30.113
So the deal's off?

01:21:30.113 --> 01:21:31.655
No, it's on.

01:21:31.655 --> 01:21:33.321
And better than ever.

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:34.864
We're re-branding.

01:21:34.864 --> 01:21:36.530
A Taste of Texas.

01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:38.989
And we'll shoot it right here
in Langston.

01:21:38.989 --> 01:21:40.238
So you're staying?

01:21:40.238 --> 01:21:41.572
Yes.

01:21:41.572 --> 01:21:44.280
And Yellow Rose is the first
product we're promoting,

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.197
so I hope you haven't signed
the papers on the house yet.

01:21:47.197 --> 01:21:50.239
Not yet.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:53.364
I don't wanna make promises
I can't keep,

01:21:53.364 --> 01:21:57.155
but with time this could
amount to something.

01:21:57.155 --> 01:22:01.030
Maybe even buy that land
across the road.

01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:02.447
But I have one more idea.

01:22:02.447 --> 01:22:05.155
Oh no, should I-
should I duck?

01:22:06.447 --> 01:22:09.072
What if your ranch
was more than a ranch?

01:22:09.072 --> 01:22:12.155
What if it was a destination?

01:22:12.155 --> 01:22:14.155
A guest ranch where people
from all over

01:22:14.155 --> 01:22:16.364
can come and see all
the wonderful things

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:19.364
that you and I love about
this place.

01:22:19.364 --> 01:22:21.823
The old west meets
the new east.

01:22:21.823 --> 01:22:24.282
What do you think?

01:22:24.282 --> 01:22:26.490
I think I'd need
a great designer.

01:22:26.490 --> 01:22:27.407
Hmm.

01:22:27.407 --> 01:22:31.198
Lucky for you I happen
to know someone.

01:22:31.198 --> 01:22:33.240
Lucky for me.

01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:42.365
Now this feels like home.
