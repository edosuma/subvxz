WEBVTT

00:12.721 --> 00:13.972
[Katie] Hospital party!

00:14.556 --> 00:16.391
Hands in the air!

00:16.474 --> 00:18.810
-Oh, yeah!
-Whoo!

00:19.310 --> 00:21.563
I cannot believe
there's no line for this ride.

00:22.814 --> 00:26.651
Oh. Roller-coasters always
make me need to go to the bathroom.

00:29.654 --> 00:32.115
You missed me so much
you had to fake sick to come back?

00:33.074 --> 00:34.743
Megan, you're here!

00:36.036 --> 00:38.580
Yeah, still got this awesome cancer thing.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.957
So, why are you here? Everything OK?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.250
Yeah, I had a fever.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.002
Now I'm just here for observation.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.003
Sucky.

00:45.086 --> 00:50.091
But if I was gonna make this all about me,
and I am, I'm super glad you're here.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.510
-I missed you!
-Oh, I missed you, too.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.263
Oh. Oh, hi, Megan.

00:55.346 --> 00:56.389
Hi, Katie.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.184
-Oh, am I in your spot?
-Oh, no.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.686
Yeah, I'll um... I'll sit in the chair.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.564
Oh, we should check out the teen room.
They redid it.

01:04.647 --> 01:08.026
-Really? What did they do?
-Added another boy-band poster.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.278
Well, now I have to check it out.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.280
-[laughter]
-[Katie] Whoo! Let's do this!

01:14.574 --> 01:16.409
Justin!

01:16.493 --> 01:19.079
Hey, the old gang's back together.
Hey, Alexa.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.538
And uh... Brenda.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.083
-Uh... Katie.
-Took a shot.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.796
This is Alexa? The troublemaker?

01:27.879 --> 01:30.715
I heard one time,
you stole the hospital helicopter.

01:30.799 --> 01:34.511
Well, it was a second piece of coffee
cake, but I like how my legend grows.

01:35.428 --> 01:38.556
What about that time you locked
Nurse Lynda in the bathroom?

01:39.390 --> 01:41.893
No one can prove that that was me.

01:42.685 --> 01:43.686
But that was me.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.397
So are we gonna do something fun?

01:46.481 --> 01:48.817
You guys can.
I'm only here for a couple of days,

01:48.900 --> 01:52.695
so I'm ready to kick back, order
room service and binge-watch everything.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.906
It's hospital food and basic cable.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.034
It's OK.

01:58.535 --> 02:02.288
I guess I can just look out the window
and count cars in the parking lot.

02:02.372 --> 02:06.084
-Red cars are 20 points, blue cars are--
-Did I say binge-watching?

02:06.167 --> 02:09.129
I meant we are gonna have so much fun.

02:09.212 --> 02:10.130
Yes!

02:10.213 --> 02:13.258
Alexa and I will brainstorm all night
and come up with some great ideas.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.969
-Thanks, Brenda!
-Katie.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.848
You guys should be in your rooms.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.184
Oh, I should have known. Alexa's here.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.396
Yeah, I was encouraging them
to go back to their rooms.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.148
Mm-hm. Oh.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.151
Hi, Katie. Visiting hours are over.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.570
B-But she's my emotional-support animal.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.697
Woof-woof?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.241
I bet that's just as cute at your house.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.952
OK, I guess I have to go.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.538
Oh, I hate to leave you alone.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.540
Don't worry, she's not alone.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.376
-She's got me.
-Mm. I'll see you tomorrow.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.924
Look, I know you're doing your job,

02:55.008 --> 02:58.052
but it really raises her spirits
when I'm around.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.054
[Alexa and Megan laughing]

03:00.138 --> 03:01.806
Uh... [chuckles]

03:01.890 --> 03:05.393

through closed doors.

She's under the bed.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.143
[laughs] And he doesn't know
she's under the bed!

03:50.730 --> 03:52.106
What are you looking at?

03:52.190 --> 03:53.942
Uh... Oh, Alexa's Instagram.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.569
Visiting hours don't start until nine.

03:56.653 --> 03:59.989
Oh, I hate when she's in the hospital.
I just don't like leaving her alone.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.616
There's other kids there.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.369
Yeah, but they're not her friends.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.037
They look like friends.

04:06.621 --> 04:09.290
-They're not her best friend.
-She looks like a best friend.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.583
She's not.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.128
No, that's... that's Megan.
She's just a hospital friend.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.633
Last year, my friend Spencer
got a new best friend.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.718
Oh. And... And what happened?

04:20.802 --> 04:24.722
Mom told me friendship's like sunshine:
there's always enough for everyone.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.766
Aw! That's nice.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.270
Wait.
You and Spencer aren't friends any more.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.064
No. There wasn't enough sunshine for me.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.235
Oh, you're gonna love this part!

04:37.318 --> 04:38.903
He falls out of the tree.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.071
[body thuds]

04:40.154 --> 04:42.407
He fell out! I knew he was gonna.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.791
Your sunshine is here!

04:53.251 --> 04:55.336
Hey, look. I stole this off a tray.
[chuckles]

04:55.420 --> 04:56.546
What tray?

04:56.629 --> 04:58.131
The one marked "Alexa."

04:59.424 --> 05:02.218
-Thanks.
-What fun thing are we doing for Michelle?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.971
We're gonna make that music video
that Megan and I talked about.

05:05.054 --> 05:08.558
Oh, yeah! That music video that you
and Megan and me always talk about.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.351
That's awesome.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.897
-Hey, kiddo.
-Hey, honey. How are you feeling?

05:14.981 --> 05:15.982
-Fine.
-Yeah?

05:16.065 --> 05:18.026
[Alexa] Wow, Lucas.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.320
You woke up on a Saturday just to see me?

05:20.695 --> 05:21.821
[groans] Not yet.

05:22.780 --> 05:26.200
He really wants to be here. I saw it
in his eyes just before they shut.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.495
So, honey,
I brought your pillow from home,

05:29.579 --> 05:32.623
and it's perfectly fine that you didn't
want me to sleep over last night.

05:32.707 --> 05:33.750
Or tonight.

05:33.833 --> 05:34.876
Also fine.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.129
Listen, we're gonna be right back.

05:38.212 --> 05:39.922
Just gonna go say hi to the nurses.

05:41.841 --> 05:42.967
Where are the nurses?

05:44.177 --> 05:45.428
Uh... Honey,

05:45.511 --> 05:48.014
you know how you get
a little uh protective

05:48.097 --> 05:49.557
when Alexa's in the hospital?

05:49.640 --> 05:52.685
Honey, it's fine. The nurses here love me.
I see you, Chad!

05:54.062 --> 05:54.896
Lori.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.315
Listen, have you scheduled
Alexa's blood test?

05:57.398 --> 05:59.776
I would have checked myself,
but someone took her chart.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.944
Yeah, doctors do that sometimes.

06:02.028 --> 06:05.073
Everything's good. She saw the doctor
this morning. Her fever's gone.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.783
They're keeping her for observation.

06:06.866 --> 06:07.909
-So...
-Right, right.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.285
Well, since I have you here,

06:09.368 --> 06:12.914
I recently read in the New England Journal
of Medicine that they're doing a study--

06:12.997 --> 06:15.458
I'm sorry, they need me in surgery.
I've got to go.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.838
Darn it! He never got a chance
to hear about that study.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.093
Dave!

06:25.176 --> 06:26.386
Lori.

06:27.512 --> 06:30.556
Lynda, can you make sure
to monitor Alexa every 15?

06:30.640 --> 06:33.643
I know she's not your only patient,
but she's my only child.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.561
I'm sitting right here.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.273
Hey, she's working the nurse.
Just go back to sleep.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.819
Alexa may not always show she needs care,
but you have to keep an eye on her.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.071
I promise I will not let you down.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.074
-Are those for anyone?
-Oh, have one.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.076
Charlene's mom made them for us.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.578
Excuse me, I'm actually on my way
to check on Charlene.

06:56.415 --> 06:57.583
Did you see that?

06:57.667 --> 06:59.252
Yeah. Lynda's great.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.754
No, Charlene's getting special treatment

07:01.838 --> 07:03.840
because her mom made cookies
for the nurses.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.216
How did I not see this before?

07:05.716 --> 07:07.009
Because it's not true?

07:08.386 --> 07:10.805
We are getting in on this cookie racket.
Let's go.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.644
[Dave grunts]

07:17.311 --> 07:18.646
What am I doing? Get up.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.279
Almost ready to shoot this.

07:26.362 --> 07:30.283
-Everybody, take your positions.
-Take your positions, everybody!

07:31.117 --> 07:34.162
-Justin, you good there?
-Yeah, I've got my dance partner.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.999
Nurse, are you ready to shoot this?

07:38.082 --> 07:40.877
I've directed three YouTube videos
and six bar mitzvahs,

07:40.960 --> 07:43.171
so, yeah, I think I got this.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.424
All right, let's do this.

Oh, sorry, guys. I've got two minutes left
of my break. We'll finish later.

08:13.951 --> 08:16.954
I've got just enough time
to eat a burrito over a trash can.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.873
[Megan laughs]

08:20.416 --> 08:21.751
I've missed Alexa.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.045
-We were up all night talking.
-Oh.

08:24.128 --> 08:27.215
-Uh... What did you guys talk about?
-Everything.

08:27.298 --> 08:30.343
Her progress, my progress, our moms,

08:30.426 --> 08:31.969
how weird it's been at school.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.138
We just talked and talked and talked.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.974
Yeah, sounds like you really talked.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.101
Yeah. And you know Alexa.

08:39.185 --> 08:42.438
She made me laugh so hard,
I sprayed milk out of my nose.

08:42.522 --> 08:46.943
[laughs] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Alexa's
been making me laugh so hard for years.

08:47.026 --> 08:50.071
Yeah, I am... I am constantly
spraying stuff out of my nose.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.030
[Katie laughs]

08:51.113 --> 08:52.573
She calls me an elephant.

08:52.657 --> 08:53.658
[Katie laughs]

08:53.741 --> 08:55.034
We're best friends.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.328
Cool.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.332
Yeah, I'm... I'm her elephant.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.127
Me.

09:06.629 --> 09:07.463
Not her.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.676
Mom, I can't believe I'm saying this,

09:11.759 --> 09:13.803
but I have homework.

09:15.763 --> 09:17.807
Yeah, well, your sister has cancer, so...

09:18.432 --> 09:19.350
Dad?

09:20.142 --> 09:23.145
[sighs] Honey,
we don't have to bribe the nurses.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.732
Alexa isn't getting more attention
because she doesn't need it. It's good.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.819
[sighs] You're right.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.320
You're right. I just...

09:31.821 --> 09:33.406
I need to calm down.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.575
Oh, God! We're out of eggs!

09:37.910 --> 09:40.288
-Lunchtime, Jack.
-I can't leave. I'm taste-tester.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.498
Self-appointed.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.167
This plate's good to go.

09:46.836 --> 09:47.962
Do you have eggs, Jennifer?

09:48.045 --> 09:51.173
Oh, yeah, if you're not fussy
about expiration dates.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.427
This seems unusual.

09:54.510 --> 09:57.680
[sighs] Yeah, she's in full-on
Alexa-in-the-hospital mode.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.724
You take psychology class.
Can you talk to her?

09:59.807 --> 10:01.225
Please?

10:01.892 --> 10:03.644
OK. Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.062
[Lori] OK.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.233
Hey, Dave,

10:09.317 --> 10:13.362
in my psychology class,
we've been talking about irrational fears.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.701
Oh? Is that something anyone can have?

10:19.577 --> 10:21.287
[Jennifer] Yes, it is.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.789
Especially parents about their kids.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.459
You know what I mean, Lori?

10:27.752 --> 10:29.003
Yeah, I do.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.714
It's like how Dave
has an irrational fear of spiders.

10:33.841 --> 10:34.842
No, I don't.

10:35.343 --> 10:39.555
I was thinking something a little bigger,
a little more hospital-y?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.016
I don't know,
it's something about those creepy things,

10:42.099 --> 10:44.185
with their hairy legs and all those eyes.

10:44.268 --> 10:45.394
OK, stop it.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.897
And they have millions of babies!

10:49.899 --> 10:52.443
And they're always hiding in dark corners.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.612
[whispers] Crawling on you
when you're sleeping.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.238
Oh, God! There's one!

10:58.157 --> 10:58.991
Did I get it?

11:00.368 --> 11:02.203
Yeah. That's one dead raisin.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.250
I swear I feed him.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.089
The video is so much fun.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.841
But I was wondering...

11:17.593 --> 11:19.095
When are we gonna make some trouble?

11:20.221 --> 11:22.640
Oh, trouble, huh?

11:23.349 --> 11:26.394
How about something
a little unauthorized after hours?

11:26.894 --> 11:28.687
Like a secret scavenger hunt.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.107
You read my mind. The nurses hate it.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.525
That's why we love it.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.527
I love it, too. I'm totally in.

11:34.610 --> 11:35.778
Hey, Michelle.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.239
[as Kermit] Kermit the Frog here
to take you to your room.

11:38.322 --> 11:40.616
[laughs] Yeah, I've got to rest up.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.370
[as Goofy] Would you prefer Goofy? Hyuck!

11:46.789 --> 11:50.751
She's on her way. Are you sure this will
uh help her with her stress about Alexa?

11:50.835 --> 11:54.588
I've taken Introduction to Psychology
twice. I think I know what I'm doing.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.177
All right. What's this thing I had to see?

12:00.261 --> 12:02.555
Jennifer has an idea she thinks will help,

12:02.638 --> 12:05.057
and I have to... go do something.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.605
-This is weird.
-You love going to Weird Town with me.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.232
I know you do.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.651
-Yeah, I do.
-[laughs]

12:15.985 --> 12:16.944
Great.

12:17.027 --> 12:19.530
You're gonna work through
your anxiety about Alexa

12:19.613 --> 12:21.907
by hitting these pillows
as hard as you can.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.743
Honestly, I'm fine!

12:23.826 --> 12:25.244
Just try it once.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.289
I don't know.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.373
[grunts]

12:31.417 --> 12:32.585
That felt good.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.380
Good! Now, if you want to keep going,
you can just--

12:36.464 --> 12:37.715
-[yells]
-OK.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.843
OK, looks like you got the hang of it.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.553
Whoa! Can I play?

12:42.636 --> 12:44.388
Oh, no, Jack. This is therapy. I don't--

12:44.472 --> 12:46.724
Take that, Spencer!

12:48.184 --> 12:49.810
OK, go ahead. [chuckles]

12:49.894 --> 12:51.312
[both grunting]

12:54.940 --> 12:57.151
I hope this thing Jennifer's doing
with your mom works.

12:57.234 --> 13:01.197
Me, too, because these oatmeal-raisin
cookies she made me bake did not come out.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.616
[dense banging]

13:08.996 --> 13:10.247
Center's good.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.332
No, it's not.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.753
[Lori yells in distance]

13:16.253 --> 13:17.922
-[glass shatters]
-[both] Yeah.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.348
-Whoa!
-Yikes!

13:29.767 --> 13:31.268
I did therapy.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.480
Dang, Mom!

13:35.981 --> 13:38.317
Take her home, Dave. Take her home now.

13:39.944 --> 13:40.945
Let's go, honey.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.404
[Lori] Mm.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.574
-I broke a lamp.
-Yes, you did.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.370
-And two picture frames and a vase.
-I'll write you a check.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.499
[clattering upstairs]

13:53.582 --> 13:54.917
[panting]

13:55.000 --> 13:57.044
I finished upstairs. What's next?

14:01.757 --> 14:04.593
...and when you find the item,
you take a picture with it.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.513
Great, just what the world needs -
more selfies.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.308
Oh, good. We've got fun Justin with us.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.690
Katie's here!

14:18.941 --> 14:21.068
I can't believe
you actually snuck back in!

14:21.151 --> 14:22.736
Oh, we were just about to pick teams.

14:23.279 --> 14:27.575
-Hm. Who should I choose?
-Me! Me! Me!

14:27.658 --> 14:28.701
Let's see.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.619
Me! Me!

14:30.703 --> 14:31.704
Me.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.165
-I choose Michelle.
-Yes!

14:35.249 --> 14:37.418
Yes, we choose Michelle!

14:38.836 --> 14:40.296
So, you and me?

14:40.379 --> 14:41.964
What can I say, Justin?

14:42.047 --> 14:44.592
I guess I'm just drawn
to your magnetic personality.

the scavenger hunt.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.692
We're so gonna win this thing.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.861
Whenever we team up,

15:45.945 --> 15:47.655
nobody else has a chance.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.531
Oh, yeah? Come on, Justin.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.742
Do you want to wrap or be wrapped?

15:51.825 --> 15:53.911
This is the one thing
I feel strongly about.

15:54.662 --> 15:55.788
I want to wrap.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.959
Do you remember our first scavenger hunt?

16:00.042 --> 16:03.128
I was having a bad day,
feeling all stir-crazy.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.713
You made me feel so much better.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.132
You know
where you're gonna feel even better?

16:07.216 --> 16:08.801
On that jet ski at the lake.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.511
Oh, yeah!

16:10.594 --> 16:11.428
[Katie laughs]

16:11.512 --> 16:13.389
Whose... Whose jet ski?

16:13.472 --> 16:14.598
W-What lake?

16:15.641 --> 16:18.978
Oh, yeah, Megan invited me to spend
a weekend at the lake with her family.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.479
Oh, great.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.856
So, are we scavenger hunting or not?

16:24.024 --> 16:25.609
Oh, do we have a choice?

16:26.110 --> 16:27.111
Laters.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.448
OK, Megan, you can just finish with us.
We always made a good team.

16:31.532 --> 16:32.741
No. No, she can't.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.160
I-I'm sorry, but she can't.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.787
OK? A-And that's not my rule.

16:36.870 --> 16:39.873
That is the International
Scavenger Hunt Rules.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.625
[laughs] Look it up.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.671
You pick a team and you stick to it.
Uh-huh.

16:45.754 --> 16:49.216
Or forfeit and return
to your room by yourself.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.302
Katie, chill out. It's just a game.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.888
Well, i-is it? Is it just a game?

16:58.475 --> 16:59.810
What is going on in here?

16:59.893 --> 17:01.937
You two should be in your rooms.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.441
And, Katie, it's the second night in a row
you've stayed past visiting hours.

17:05.524 --> 17:07.192
Sorry, but you can't come back tomorrow.

17:07.735 --> 17:10.738
What? No!
No, I-I have to come back tomorrow, OK?

17:10.821 --> 17:11.905
Alexa needs me.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.158
Katie, I'll be fine.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.201
Oh.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.746
OK, then. Then I'll go.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.711
Lynda, I-I'll finish it at home.

[door closes]

17:48.942 --> 17:50.069
Hey, sweetie.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.571
I brought you a pancake.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.201
I brought you a smile!

18:00.120 --> 18:01.371
What's wrong?

18:01.455 --> 18:02.915
Oh, nothing.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.792
Nothing. It's just a Megan thing.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.504
You know,
I-I kind of lost it last night with Alexa.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.005
Oh, honey.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.843
You know, the thing about friendships,
they're like sunshine--

18:14.927 --> 18:15.928
Mom.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.100
I just, I really wanted
to be there for her.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.478
Especially after what happened
with the play on Friday.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.523
I-I need to fix this.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.818
-[sighs]
-Alexa's your best friend.

18:30.901 --> 18:34.113
Just go down there and talk to her.
There's nothing stopping you.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.950
Hey, you're right. [chuckles]

18:38.033 --> 18:42.037
Yeah, I mean, who cares if I was "banned"
from the hospital?

18:43.247 --> 18:44.623
That's the... What?

18:58.804 --> 19:00.013
[brake releases]

19:10.732 --> 19:12.025
[brake locks]

19:21.285 --> 19:22.536
Hey, Katie.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.371
I'm not here! I'm home.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.415
And I'm in the South of France.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.175
[sighs]

19:37.092 --> 19:39.303
[man] Group meeting in the teen room!

19:41.471 --> 19:42.723
Come on, guys.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.684
Get ready to get your share on!

19:45.767 --> 19:47.102
Yeah, come on in.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.480
Just want to remind everyone

19:50.564 --> 19:52.983
this is a safe space.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.819
Crying is encouraged. So is laughing.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.614
You guys know me. I'll probably do both.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.700
Let's make these next two hours count.

20:02.409 --> 20:03.619
[mouths]

20:08.415 --> 20:09.625
[Lori snaps fingers]

20:13.754 --> 20:16.298
Lynda, hi. Listen um...

20:16.924 --> 20:19.760
I know I've been a little critical
about Alexa's care.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.386
[Dave coughs]

20:21.470 --> 20:23.805
Very critical. Um...

20:23.889 --> 20:25.015
But I just want you to know

20:25.098 --> 20:27.517
that I appreciate
everything you do for our daughter.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.852
I hope you can forgive me.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.063
[sighs] Your child has cancer.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.023
You're doing the best you can.

20:33.732 --> 20:34.733
Thanks.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.902
These are not a bribe.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.195
[Dave coughs]

20:38.695 --> 20:39.780
They were a bribe.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.491
But now they're a thank-you.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.409
Lori, Dave, great news.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.079
Dr. Breitwieser
is going to release Alexa this afternoon.

20:47.162 --> 20:50.249
She just needs to avoid germs, so should
do school from home for a few days.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.875
-OK, well, that's great!
-Yeah.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.210
Hey, that's good news.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.295
Alexa's one strong girl.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.339
I bet she gets it from her mother.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.049
[Dave coughs]

20:59.132 --> 21:00.259
And her father.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.225
[Lori] Lucas!

21:11.979 --> 21:14.606
And I just feel stuck,

21:14.690 --> 21:17.150
and I start to panic
because I don't know what to do.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.405
Do I destroy the Death Star
or retreat back to the Rebel base?

21:21.488 --> 21:22.489
I don't...

21:23.115 --> 21:26.034
Justin, I feel like
I shouldn't have to say this.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.245
You blow up the Death Star!

21:29.913 --> 21:33.250
Anyone have anything to share
that is non-video-game-related?

21:33.333 --> 21:34.334
-I'll go.
-Megan.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.129
I've been having this weird dream lately.

21:37.796 --> 21:41.174
It's New Year's Eve and I'm all dressed up
at this great party.

21:41.258 --> 21:45.804
And then, at midnight, my beautiful dress
just turns into a hospital gown,

21:45.887 --> 21:48.682
and all the hair I've grown back
just disappears.

21:48.765 --> 21:51.351
It's like a really weird Cinderella story.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.229
I talked to Alexa about it and it helped.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.356
-Thanks.
-Well, you helped me, too.

21:57.024 --> 22:01.320
Like when I told you about how weird it
was when everybody found out at my school.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.739
I wonder what it will be like
when I go back.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.783
I'll save you the suspense:
it will be weird.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.912
-Didn't somebody get you a goldfish?
-[laughs] Yeah.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.165
But it's worth it.

22:13.707 --> 22:16.918
I'm so glad I get to go to school
and be with my friends,

22:17.002 --> 22:18.879
especially my best friend, Katie.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.049
-Katie?
-Yeah, Brenda.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.510
Justin, you'll be fine.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.554
And if people give you weird looks,

22:27.637 --> 22:31.099
you can take comfort in knowing
it might just be because you are weird.

22:32.059 --> 22:32.934
True.

22:35.771 --> 22:36.813
I miss this.

22:37.355 --> 22:43.361
I forgot what it's like to be around
people who understand the dreams,

22:43.445 --> 22:45.822
and the hospitals and the looks.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.909
You guys get it like no one else can.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.122
Katie?

22:54.664 --> 22:56.458
Uh... J-Just... Just ignore me.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.251
Yeah. I'm not here.

22:58.835 --> 23:00.420
You don't see me.

23:01.254 --> 23:02.255
I'm gonna go.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.133
I'll be right back.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.930
Should Alexa be alone
with that crazy girl?

23:11.515 --> 23:12.599
Katie, wait!

23:14.893 --> 23:19.106
I've got so many questions,
but I'm gonna start with: are you OK?

23:20.148 --> 23:25.487
No. No, I-I'm crazy and jealous
and a bad friend.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.657
I sort of got the feeling
that you were jealous of Megan,

23:28.740 --> 23:31.451
but I didn't realize it was this...

23:32.702 --> 23:33.537
intense.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.290
You hid in a closet.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.543
Yeah, I did.

23:40.836 --> 23:44.881
But... at least now I understand
why you're so close with Megan.

23:47.300 --> 23:51.054
She gets what you're going through
in a way that I never will.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.100
And I hate that.

23:58.895 --> 23:59.896
Katie.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.149
Hey.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.944
You get everything else about me

24:06.027 --> 24:07.487
that no one ever will.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.409
And I'm glad we don't share this.

24:14.619 --> 24:17.455
It's not a club
I ever want you to be a part of.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.291
Yeah.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.836
But I still need my Katie hugs.

24:28.675 --> 24:29.926
[Katie sniffs]

24:30.010 --> 24:32.929
Gosh, I'm sorry I got so crazy.

24:33.847 --> 24:34.723
"Got"?

24:37.267 --> 24:38.518
[Alexa chuckles]

24:38.602 --> 24:40.645
[Lynda] Katie Cooper!
I don't believe this!

24:41.771 --> 24:43.106
OK, I love you. Got to go!

24:43.190 --> 24:44.316
[Alexa laughs]

24:45.984 --> 24:49.613
[Alexa] When you find something as special
as the friendship Katie and I have,

24:49.696 --> 24:52.282
you protect it with everything you've got.

24:52.365 --> 24:54.075
Nothing can break us.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.411
Not a play or another friend.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.247
And definitely not cancer.
