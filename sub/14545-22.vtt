WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:03.304
(Tessa) ONCE UPON A TIME,
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

00:03.337 --> 00:05.639
THE LOWER EAST SIDE
AND THE FIERY PITS OF HELL,

00:05.673 --> 00:07.408
THERE LIVED A LITTLE TOWN
CALLED CHATSWIN.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.078
(women) * CHATSWIN

00:10.111 --> 00:11.645
HISTORICALLY,
CHATSWIN WAS A TOWN

00:11.679 --> 00:14.748
THAT VALUED ITS MOTHERS
ABOVE ALL ELSE,

00:14.782 --> 00:18.452
AND SO, ON THE SECOND SUNDAY
OF EVERY MAY...

00:18.486 --> 00:19.853
(horse whinnies,
hooves clomping)

00:19.887 --> 00:21.389
THEY SET OUT TO PROVE IT.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.391
(Fred)
MAKE WAY FOR CINDERELLY!

00:23.424 --> 00:24.158
(whinnies)

00:24.192 --> 00:25.826
ALL HAIL CINDERELLY!

00:25.859 --> 00:27.228
(whinnies)

00:27.261 --> 00:30.331
(horse blusters)

00:30.364 --> 00:31.599
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, LUCILLE.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.334
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, SHEILA.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.635
I FEEL LIKE A PRINCESS.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.104
LITTLE MUCH, DON'T YOU THINK?

00:36.137 --> 00:38.339
CAN'T HELP IT
IF MY FAMILY LOVES ME MORE,

00:38.372 --> 00:39.707
BUT $10 WELL-SPENT

00:39.740 --> 00:42.843
ON THE SELF-INFLATED
BALLOONS, GLEN.

00:42.876 --> 00:43.777
GLEN?

00:43.811 --> 00:44.778
YAH!
(horse whinnies)

00:46.414 --> 00:48.849
IN THE PAST, THE TOWN RULE
SEEMED TO BE,

00:48.882 --> 00:50.651
IF YOU LOVED YOUR MOTHER,

00:50.684 --> 00:53.687
YOU'D BETTER BE WILLING TO GO
"FULL PAGE" TO PROVE IT,

00:53.721 --> 00:55.523
AND THIS YEAR WAS NO DIFFERENT.

00:55.556 --> 00:59.160
IT KINDA MADE ME GLAD
I WASN'T IN THE GAME.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.362
MOTHER'S DAY WEEKEND, HUH?

01:01.395 --> 01:03.231
YEP.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.732
ANY FEELINGS ABOUT
THE BIG DAY?

01:04.765 --> 01:07.601
I'M, UH, MORE OF
A COLUMBUS DAY GIRL MYSELF.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.138
THAT'S A GREAT JOKE, TESSA,

01:10.171 --> 01:12.573
BUT SOMETIMES... (sighs)

01:12.606 --> 01:16.144
IT'S HEALTHY
TO TALK THINGS THROUGH.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.479
I'M SURE, ON MOTHER'S DAY,
YOU MUST THINK ABOUT HER.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.149
I'M SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU,
BUT I DON'T.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.651
HOW ABOUT YOU,
MADAME SURROGATE?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.619
EVER THINK ABOUT
ALL THOSE BABIES YOU SOLD

01:25.653 --> 01:27.821
AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING
ON MOTHER'S DAY?

01:27.855 --> 01:31.625
OHH. THAT'S GONNA SIT
IN YOUR COLON FOR A DECADE.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.461
LUCKILY, THERE'S PLENTY
OF ROOM IN MY COLON

01:33.494 --> 01:36.564
AFTER THAT KELP NOODLE CASSEROLE
YOU MADE LAST NIGHT.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.767
REALLY FREED UP
SOME REAL ESTATE.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.269
(chuckles)

01:41.302 --> 01:44.838
AND BY THAT, I MEAN
IT GAVE ME LOOSE STOOL.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.707
Captioned by
Closed Captioning Services, Inc.

01:46.740 --> 01:51.645
(Alih Jay) * LAST NIGHT I HAD
A PLEASANT NIGHTMARE *

01:51.679 --> 01:57.318
* DA-DA-DA-DA,
DA, DA, DA, DA *

01:57.351 --> 01:59.820
I'M SO GLAD WE WENT WITH
AN "ENDANGERED ANIMALS" THEME

01:59.853 --> 02:01.389
FOR THE NURSERY.
WOW!

02:01.422 --> 02:03.457
AND THE PELTS FEEL GREAT
UNDERFOOT.

02:03.491 --> 02:04.958
THE PELTS?
FORGET ABOUT THE PELTS.

02:04.992 --> 02:08.162
(chuckles) I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU FOUND AN IVORY TUSK CRIB!

02:08.196 --> 02:11.199
MM. THE INTERIOR DECORATOR HAD
SOME OF THE ANIMALS MURDERED

02:11.232 --> 02:12.566
JUST FOR THIS ROOM.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.468
SHE REALLY WENT
THE EXTRA MILE.

02:14.502 --> 02:18.606
THERE ARE 950 DEAD SNAKES
ON THIS WALL ALONE.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.773
AND THE GUNS...

02:19.807 --> 02:21.742
LIVE. ALL LIVE.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.712
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T SEE THAT
ENOUGH IN A NURSERY,

02:24.745 --> 02:26.380
NOT FOR MY TASTE.

02:26.414 --> 02:29.583
OH, NOAH. I CAN'T WAIT
FOR THIS BABY TO GET HERE.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.320
I CAN'T WAIT
FOR OUR NIGHT NURSE TO GET HERE.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.587
YOU KNOW
I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE

02:33.621 --> 02:35.656
HAVING INTERCOURSE
DURING THE LAST TRIMESTER.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.625
(strained voice) I KNOW.
I JUST THOUGHT,

02:37.658 --> 02:40.261
SINCE YOU WEREN'T ACTUALLY
CARRYING THE BABY...

02:40.294 --> 02:42.896
OHH. I MAY NOT BE CARRYING
THE BABY HERE,

02:42.930 --> 02:45.799
BUT I MOST CERTAINLY AM
CARRYING IT HERE.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.868
(chuckles)

02:47.901 --> 02:49.803
(taps foot)

02:49.837 --> 02:51.639
(George) WHATCHA DOIN'?

02:51.672 --> 02:55.409
PLAYING THE BABY SOME AUDIO
FROM "OCCUPY WALL STREET."

02:55.443 --> 02:57.978
(chuckles)
AND--AND WHERE DOES HE LAND?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.381
WITH ANY LUCK,
LEFT OF CHATSWIN.

03:00.414 --> 03:01.915
(chuckles)

03:01.949 --> 03:03.917
ARE YOU--ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT
THIS BABY SHOWER TOMORROW?

03:03.951 --> 03:05.486
IF, BY "EXCITED,"

03:05.519 --> 03:08.856
YOU MEAN "FILLED WITH
AN IMPENDING SENSE OF DREAD,"

03:08.889 --> 03:10.324
THEN YES, VERY.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.593
I AM FASCINATED
BY THIS SIDE OF YOU.

03:12.626 --> 03:13.961
YOU'VE GONE DARK ON ME.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.397
(whispers) I'M NOT MYSELF.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.431
(normal voice)
I'M IRRITABLE...

03:17.465 --> 03:18.332
MM.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.733
AND PENT UP.
SURE.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.869
OKAY.
YOU WANNA GO FOR A JOG?

03:21.902 --> 03:24.838
NO.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.374
(chuckles)
YOU WANNA GRAB SOME LUNCH?

03:26.407 --> 03:27.741
NOPE.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.244
I WANNA GRAB SOMETHING ELSE.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.044
(chuckles) REALLY?

03:31.078 --> 03:32.413
MM-HMM.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.815
I-I FEEL LIKE
WE'VE WAITED SO LONG.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.250
I MEAN,
IT'S YOUR LAST TRIMESTER.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.051
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S NOT DANGEROUS?

03:38.085 --> 03:41.021
(whispers) IT'S GONNA BE
DANGEROUS FOR YOU IF WE DON'T.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.024
IT MEANS A LOT TO YOUR MOM,
YOU COMING HOME FOR THE SHOWER.

03:44.057 --> 03:44.792
UH-HUH.

03:44.825 --> 03:45.993
HEY, DID SHE TELL YOU
WE'RE TRYING

03:46.026 --> 03:48.396
TO STEAL CARMEN BACK
FROM THE ROYCES?

03:48.429 --> 03:49.797
WOULDN'T THAT BE FUNNY?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.699
THE SAME NANNY
THAT RAISED YOU

03:51.732 --> 03:53.501
COULD RAISE
YOUR LITTLE HERMANO.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.835
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE
EVEN FUNNIER?

03:54.868 --> 03:56.837
IF YOU AND MOM RAISED
YOUR OWN KID.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.006
THAT'D BE HILARIOUS.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.275
WHY DO YOU GUYS NEED
CARMEN?

04:01.309 --> 04:02.843
WHY DOES ANYONE NEED
CARMEN?

04:02.876 --> 04:05.078
(chuckles) BECAUSE SHE'S
AMAZINGLY HELPFUL.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.547
BECAUSE CARMEN CAN
EASILY DO THINGS

04:06.580 --> 04:08.682
THAT EXASPERATE
MOST WHITE PEOPLE.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.651
WELL, I HOPE I GROW UP
TO BE LIKE CARMEN.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.786
(chuckles) OH. YEAH.
YOU WON'T.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.459
(sighs)

04:21.662 --> 04:24.097
ARE YOU JUST
NOT ATTRACTED TO ME

04:24.131 --> 04:25.533
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT?

04:25.566 --> 04:27.735
I'M VERY ATTRACTED TO YOU.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.337
BUT WHAT?

04:29.370 --> 04:31.004
JUST NOT WHEN I'M NAKED?
BECAUSE OF THE BIG BELLY?

04:31.038 --> 04:32.640
NO.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.342
IS IT BECAUSE OF THE VEINS?
WHAT?

04:34.375 --> 04:38.078
IS IT BECAUSE OF MY THROBBING,
BLUE SPIDER VEINS?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.980
THEY'RE FROM THE PREGNANCY.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.949
OH. OH.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.051
SO NORMALLY
YOU'RE LESS VEINY?

04:44.084 --> 04:48.121
NO. THAT'S NOT IT.

04:48.155 --> 04:51.058
(sighs)
THEN WHAT, GEORGE?

04:51.091 --> 04:53.661
(sighs) I COULDN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT WHAT NOAH SAID,

04:53.694 --> 04:55.095
ABOUT HOW
I WAS GONNA GIVE THE KID

04:55.128 --> 04:56.897
AN ACCIDENTAL TRACHEOTOMY.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.466
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:58.499 --> 05:00.501
WHY DON'T YOU STOP WORRYING
ABOUT NOAH'S KID

05:00.534 --> 05:02.436
AND START WORRYING
ABOUT YOUR OWN?

05:02.470 --> 05:03.904
WHAT--WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

05:03.937 --> 05:06.807
THIS MORNING, I BROACHED
THE WHOLE MOM ISSUE WITH TESSA.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.776
WHAT WHOLE "MOM ISSUE"?

05:08.809 --> 05:11.011
I THINK SHE'S IN DENIAL.
I THINK YOU BOTH ARE.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.647
O-OKAY. EDEN, PLEASE.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.148
I'VE--I'VE TALKED
TO TESSA ABOUT THIS,

05:15.182 --> 05:17.084
AND SHE'S FINE, OKAY?

05:17.117 --> 05:19.520
SHE--SHE TOLD ME OUTRIGHT
THAT SHE CAN'T MISS

05:19.553 --> 05:20.954
WHAT SHE NEVER KNEW.

05:20.988 --> 05:25.025
SHE'S GOTTA FEEL SOMETHING--
ANGRY, HURT--

05:25.058 --> 05:26.694
UNLESS YOU PEOPLE ARE
SOME KIND

05:26.727 --> 05:28.829
OF DIFFERENT SPECIES
OUT HERE.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.864
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T HAVE
YOUR MOM CHECK OUT

05:30.898 --> 05:33.701
AND FEEL ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!

05:33.734 --> 05:38.539
EDEN, YOU ARE SMART
AND INTUITIVE AND WONDERFUL,

05:38.572 --> 05:40.541
BUT YOU'RE WRONG.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.675
IN THIS CASE, YOU'RE WRONG.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.044
I KNOW MY KID,

05:44.077 --> 05:46.547
AND I'M NOT GONNA FORCE HER

05:46.580 --> 05:50.418
TO PICK AT A SCAB THAT
ISN'T THERE.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.052
SHE'S OKAY.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.454
OKAY?

05:53.487 --> 05:56.990
(sighs) OKAY.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.460
OKAY. COME HERE.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.528
(inhales deeply) MM.

06:02.796 --> 06:03.864
WHY AREN'T YOU
HUGGING ME BACK?

06:06.434 --> 06:08.402
(sighs)

06:11.772 --> 06:13.907
IN THIS BOX,
MY SECRET WEAPON

06:13.941 --> 06:16.143
FOR THE MOTHER'S DAY 5K
TOMORROW.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.445
WHOA!

06:17.478 --> 06:18.579
THEY'D BETTER WATCH
THEIR BACKS,

06:18.612 --> 06:20.848
'CAUSE I RAN TRACK
IN COLLEGE.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.418
YOU MUST WIN THE 5K
EVERY YEAR IN THESE BABIES.

06:24.452 --> 06:27.521
ACTUALLY, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'LL BE IN TOWN TO COMPETE.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.057
STEVEN USED TO ALWAYS
TAKE US AWAY FOR MOTHER'S DAY...

06:30.090 --> 06:32.059
TO ISRAEL.

06:32.092 --> 06:32.893
ISRAEL?

06:32.926 --> 06:34.227
OH, MY GOSH, YES.

06:34.261 --> 06:37.030
EVERY PERSON SHOULD MAKE
THE PILGRIMAGE TO ISRAEL,

06:37.064 --> 06:38.966
AND NOT JUST
FOR THE DEAD SEA WRAPS,

06:38.999 --> 06:40.668
BUT ALSO
FOR THE FUSION CUISINE.

06:40.701 --> 06:41.969
(bells jingle)

06:42.002 --> 06:43.070
MOMMY, WHERE'S MY PASSPORT?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.104
YOUR PASSPORT?

06:44.137 --> 06:46.006
FOR ISRAEL. DUH.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.775
DADDY DIDN'T WANT TO RUIN
MY MOTHER'S DAY

06:47.808 --> 06:49.209
BY SPOILING THE TRADITION.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.945
(chuckles) BUT, DALIA,
IT'S MOTHER'S DAY.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.482
I RENTED A POOLSIDE CABANA
FOR US AT THE CLUB.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.485
I WAS GONNA RUN THE 5K,
AND YOU WERE GONNA CHEER FOR ME.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.152
SO YOU WANT ME TO CANCEL?

06:59.186 --> 07:00.921
NO.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.123
NEVER MIND.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.059
I'M SURE THE TWO OF YOU WILL
HAVE A GREAT TIME.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.467
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY.

07:13.501 --> 07:14.535
THANKS.
I'LL EAT A KEBAB FOR YOU.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.544
(bells jingle)

07:23.577 --> 07:25.045
I'M SORRY, DALLAS.
(door closes)

07:25.078 --> 07:27.214
OH, DON'T BE SILLY.
IT'S FINE.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.817
YOU KNOW, THAT'S ONE THING
I ADMIRE IN DALIA.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.620
SHE PUTS HER OWN HAPPINESS
BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE'S.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.489
YEAH, THAT'S...
REAL ADMIRABLE.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.890
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:36.924 --> 07:39.627
I'M GONNA RUN THAT 5K,
AND WHEN I WIN,

07:39.660 --> 07:41.929
I'LL BE CELEBRATING
IN MY POOLSIDE CABANA

07:41.962 --> 07:44.898
WITH A BIG OL' DENVER OMELET
TO KEEP ME COMPANY.

07:44.932 --> 07:48.235
A DENVER OMELET MIGHT
ACTUALLY BE BETTER COMPANY.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.571
ESPECIALLY IF IT HAS
FRESH MOZZARELLA.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.905
MMM. LOVE THAT.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.607
(chuckles)

07:53.641 --> 07:55.208
THEN AFTER I BUFF AWAY
HER CALLOUSES,

07:55.242 --> 07:56.644
I WILL DUMP THE WATER,

07:56.677 --> 07:58.078
DISPOSE
OF THE HARDENED SKIN SHAVINGS,

07:58.111 --> 07:59.947
AND PRESENT HER WITH MY GIFT.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.015
VISCOSE MOISTURIZING SOCKS.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.083
BOOM!

08:03.116 --> 08:05.653
CAN'T BE BEAT.
(chuckles) LISA.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.254
LISA WAS STILL AWAITING
TEST RESULTS

08:07.287 --> 08:09.790
THAT WOULD PROVE
HER MOTHER WAS NOT HER MOTHER.

08:09.823 --> 08:13.026
UNTIL THEN, CELEBRATING THE DAY
SEEMED POINTLESS.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.294
I'M GONNA HOLD OFF
THIS YEAR.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.029
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

08:16.063 --> 08:19.132
DOES YOUR MOTHER "HOLD OFF" WHEN
YOUR CLOTHES NEED LAUNDERING?

08:19.166 --> 08:22.670
DID SHE "HOLD OFF" DURING
YOUR LATEST BOUT OF PINWORM?

08:22.703 --> 08:24.705
I'M WAITING FOR SOME
VERY IMPORTANT PAPERWORK.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.073
(sighs)
WHAT KIND OF PAPERWORK?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.708
YOU DIDN'T NAME A STAR
AFTER HER, DID YOU?

08:27.741 --> 08:28.609
'CAUSE PEOPLE HATE THAT.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.910
NOT ALL PEOPLE HATE THAT.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.178
LISA, I HAVE A PRESENT PLAN
THAT IS BIG ENOUGH

08:31.211 --> 08:34.147
TO BE FROM BOTH OF US,
SO IT WILL BE FROM BOTH OF US.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.849
YOU CAN REIMBURSE ME LATER.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.551
YOU KNOW HOW YOUR MOTHER'S
FAVORITE RECORDING ARTIST IS--

08:37.585 --> 08:38.686
JAMES INGRAM.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.821
YES, SO I HAVE PLANNED
AN ENTIRE DAY

08:40.854 --> 08:43.323
TO HIS SONG "ONE HUNDRED WAYS,"
AND BELIEVE ME,

08:43.356 --> 08:45.092
I HAVE FOUND
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.560
WHEN WE GET TO 98,

08:46.594 --> 08:48.061
I WOULD APPRECIATE YOU KIDS
CLOSING YOUR DOORS.

08:48.095 --> 08:51.098
OKAY, GANG. JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE MY PIT CREW

08:51.131 --> 08:52.900
IS PREPARED
FOR THE RACE TOMORROW.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.802
FRED, DIXIE CUPS--
YOU ON IT?

08:54.835 --> 08:55.903
I'M ON IT.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.004
AND DON'T OVERFILL 'EM, FRED.
I JUST NEED A MOUTHFUL.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.172
PROBABLY GONNA BE
A SWISH AND SPIT.
SWISH AND SPIT.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.974
PROBABLY WON'T SWALLOW.
WHATEVER YOU'RE
COMFORTABLE WITH.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.242
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.811
RYAN, POTASSIUM--
I'M GONNA NEED IT

09:03.844 --> 09:05.312
AS SOON AS I COME ACROSS
THAT FINISH LINE.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.647
POTASSIUM--CHECK.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.583
LISA, MEDIC--
THAT MEANS ACE BANDAGES,

09:09.617 --> 09:11.184
ANTISEPTIC WASH,
AND A PINT OF MY BLOOD

09:11.218 --> 09:13.353
FROM THE DOWNSTAIRS FREEZER
JUST IN CASE.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.723
YOU BANK BLOOD
IN THE DOWNSTAIRS FREEZER?

09:17.691 --> 09:20.794
EVERY DAY
AT APPROXIMATELY 3:45,

09:20.828 --> 09:22.362
THE MAIL CAME,

09:22.395 --> 09:24.197
AND WITH IT CAME THE HOPE
THAT I'D GET GOOD NEWS

09:24.231 --> 09:26.667
ABOUT THE INTERNSHIP
I APPLIED FOR.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.802
AN ACCEPTANCE LETTER
FROM "THE VILLAGE VOICE"

09:28.836 --> 09:30.671
WOULD MEAN A WAY OUT
OF CHATSWIN

09:30.704 --> 09:33.641
AND A BREAK FROM THE MISERY
OF LIVING WITH GEORGE AND EDEN.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.116
(bag thuds)

09:43.150 --> 09:44.885
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
I USED TO TELL PEOPLE

09:44.918 --> 09:46.987
I WAS GONNA BE
IN DESTINY'S CHILD.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.257
WHEN YOU'RE LITTLE,

09:50.290 --> 09:54.061
YOU DON'T HAVE A SENSE
OF WHAT'S REALISTIC.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.696
IS THAT THE MAIL?

09:55.729 --> 09:57.865
NO, IT'S, UH,
15 DANCING ELEPHANTS.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.767
(laughs)
OF COURSE IT'S THE MAIL.
(laughs)

10:01.368 --> 10:05.338
(gasps)
THIS IS IT! THIS IS FOR ME!

10:05.372 --> 10:07.340
LISA WAS HOPING THIS LETTER
WOULD PROVE

10:07.374 --> 10:10.010
THAT SHE WASN'T
WHO THEY SAID SHE WAS.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.649
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
I FELT IT IN MY BONES.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.017
WELL, YOUR BONES
WERE WRONG.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.186
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
THE ADOPTION VIDEO THAT I FOUND?

10:19.219 --> 10:20.988
MAYBE THEY WERE GONNA ADOPT
AND THEN THEY GOT PREGNANT.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.422
(whispers)
I KNOW THAT I'M ADOPTED.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.859
ACCORDING TO THE D.N.A. RESULTS,
LISA, YOU'RE NOT,

10:25.893 --> 10:28.796
BUT YOU CAN STILL GROW UP
TO BE WHOEVER YOU WANT TO BE.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.230
EXACTLY,
AND FOR THE RECORD,

10:30.263 --> 10:31.364
IT'S NOT THE WORST THING
IN THE WORLD

10:31.398 --> 10:33.066
THAT YOUR PARENTS ARE
YOUR PARENTS.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.303
I MEAN, THEY MAY NOT BE PERFECT,
BUT THEY REALLY LOVE YOU.

10:38.238 --> 10:41.108
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
IGNORANT YOU SOUND RIGHT NOW?

10:46.313 --> 10:49.382
IN SPAIN, THEY HAVE THE RUNNING
OF THE BULLS. HERE...

10:49.416 --> 10:55.823
**

10:55.856 --> 10:58.792
GET READY TO RUN,
YOU MOTHERS!

10:58.826 --> 11:04.998
**

11:05.032 --> 11:07.434
WHILE THE MOTHERS OF CHATSWIN
RAN FOR THEIR LIVES,

11:07.467 --> 11:10.470
WE HAD TICKETS
TO A THREE-RING CIRCUS...

11:10.503 --> 11:12.172
WATCH YOUR STEP, EVERYONE.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.507
THE CHEETAH DROPPINGS ARE
PHENOMENAL.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.109
THE WERNERS' BABY SHOWER.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.244
HEY, THERE SHE IS. JILL!

11:17.277 --> 11:18.045
OH.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.447
HEY. CONGRATULATIONS.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.815
HELLO IN THERE.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.251
HELLO, MY LOVE.
CAN YOU SAY "MOMMY"?

11:24.284 --> 11:26.153
CAN YOU SAY
"MOMMY JILL WERNER"?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.254
HE CAN'T.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.923
(gasps) OH.
WHO'S GOT YOUR NOSE?

11:29.957 --> 11:33.293
MOMMY'S GOT YOUR NOSE.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.928
I THINK
HE LOVES WHEN I DO THAT.

11:34.962 --> 11:35.963
YOU THINK?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.497
GEORGE,
SHE LOOKS MAGNIFICENT.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.800
YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING
EXCELLENT CARE OF HER.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.301
WELL, BEEN TRYING.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.502
ALTHOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

11:42.535 --> 11:44.171
AFTER THE BABY IS BORN.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.140
SHE'S JUST GONNA SHRIVEL UP
INTO A BIG PILE OF ASH.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.242
I'M GONNA GO GET SOME FOOD.
I'M GONNA JOIN YOU.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.778
(chuckles)
EDEN, WAIT.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.279
DARLING, I WANT TO SHOW YOU
THE NURSERY,

11:52.312 --> 11:54.882
AND I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO THE COEN BROTHERS.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.283
THEY'RE GOING TO BE FILMING
THE BIRTH.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.350
THE COEN BROTHERS?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.419
HEY, GEORGE. EDEN.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.021
HI, NOAH.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.890
OH, DARLING, WOULD YOU PLEASE
PUT THE ANIMALS IN THE CAGE

12:02.923 --> 12:05.058
SO PEOPLE CAN EAT WITHOUT THEM
JUMPING UP ON THE FOOD?

12:05.092 --> 12:08.061
ON IT. COME ON NOW! YAH!

12:08.095 --> 12:09.997
YAH! YAH!

12:10.030 --> 12:12.866
YAH! WHEE! WHEE!

12:12.900 --> 12:14.301
YAH!

12:18.438 --> 12:21.208
(cheering)

12:21.241 --> 12:23.443
COME ON, SHEILA. OH, NO.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.346
NO, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NOT YOU!

12:26.379 --> 12:28.215
(grunts) NOT YOU.
(panting) OHH. OHH.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.850
YOU'VE GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME, FRED!

12:29.883 --> 12:33.253
OHH! SH-SHEILA.
OH, GOD. OHH. OHH.
(water dripping)

12:33.286 --> 12:36.456
OHH. SHEILA. SHEILA. SHEILA.

12:36.489 --> 12:39.159
SHEILA. SHEILA. SHEILA.
SHEILA.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.527
(pants) OHH. (squeaks)

12:40.560 --> 12:41.795
OHH. I LOVE YOU!

12:41.829 --> 12:43.831
AAH! MY ANKLE!
(crowd gasps)

12:46.867 --> 12:47.901
(woman) DALLAS!

12:47.935 --> 12:50.938
NICE HUSTLE OUT THERE, FELLAS.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.505
(siren wailing in distance)
(groaning)

12:55.342 --> 12:56.944
ANY FAMILY WE SHOULD CALL?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.178
NO. (sighs)

12:58.211 --> 13:00.247
A CLOSE FRIEND, MAYBE, WHO COULD
PICK YOU UP FROM THE HOSPITAL?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.548
HOW'S MY HAIR?

13:01.581 --> 13:03.984
FANTASTIC.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.053
THEN CALL GEORGE ALTMAN.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.888
WHAT WAS THAT?

13:07.921 --> 13:10.423
I SAID... CARMEN.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.326
CALL CARMEN.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.062
(Ryan) LET'S GO, MOM! WIN!

13:15.095 --> 13:16.296
(Mr. Wolfe)
RUN, LADIES! RUN!

13:16.329 --> 13:20.067
COME ON!
LET'S GO, MOM! WIN!

13:20.100 --> 13:24.137
YEAH! COME ON, MOM!

13:24.171 --> 13:26.173
(exhales deeply) AAH!
(laughing)

13:26.206 --> 13:27.440
OHH! OH! (laughs)

13:27.474 --> 13:28.575
YEAH! YEAH.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.210
OH. MMM. MMM.
OH. OHH.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.578
(mouth full)
YOUR FATHER SCREWED THE POOCH...
MM.

13:31.611 --> 13:32.579
YES!
BUT I WON ANYWAY!

13:32.612 --> 13:33.646
YOU SURE DID, MOM!
(laughing)

13:33.680 --> 13:35.015
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!
MM. MMM.

13:35.048 --> 13:39.152
OHH.
MM. MM.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.054
(indistinct conversations)

13:41.088 --> 13:43.023
(lowered voice) I JUST THINK
IT'S A SAD STATEMENT

13:43.056 --> 13:44.958
WHEN A KID DECIDES
TO SPEND MOTHER'S DAY

13:44.992 --> 13:46.526
WITH HER FATHER.
(lowered voice) MM.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.161
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?
(chuckles)

13:48.195 --> 13:50.430
(mouth full) YOU DON'T KNOW
OUR SITUATION.

13:50.463 --> 13:53.967
RELAX, HON. WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT DALLAS ROYCE.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.572
(spits)

13:59.606 --> 14:01.041
HEY, TESS. YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:01.074 --> 14:04.945
IT'S JUST
CUCUMBER AND CREAM CHEESE?

14:04.978 --> 14:05.946
I MEAN, WHY?

14:05.979 --> 14:07.280
NOT A BIG FAN, HUH?
NO.

14:07.314 --> 14:10.117
(Jill)
GEORGE, COME QUICK. IT'S EDEN.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.484
OKAY, UH--
DO YOU WANT--

14:11.518 --> 14:13.053
NO, YOU STAY HERE.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.055
AAH! GEORGE!

14:15.088 --> 14:16.189
(Jill sighs)

14:16.223 --> 14:17.290
EDEN, YOU OKAY?

14:17.324 --> 14:19.893
(voice breaks)
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.494
(sighs) THEY'RE MONSTERS!

14:21.528 --> 14:25.198
WHAT KIND OF A CHILD
ARE THEY GONNA RAISE IN HERE?

14:25.232 --> 14:28.168
THERE'S A CLUB
OVER BY THAT STUFFED SEAL.

14:28.201 --> 14:32.505
THIS? THIS IS A PERSONALIZED
MAHOGANY LOUISVILLE SLUGGER...

14:32.539 --> 14:35.142
BUT I SUPPOSE YOU COULD.

14:35.175 --> 14:38.145
(strained voice)
OH, NO. NO!

14:38.178 --> 14:41.414
THIS FEELS LIKE LABOR.
I SHOULDN'T BE IN LABOR.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.350
I'M NOT DUE FOR WEEKS.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.118
OKAY, WE--WE SHOULD GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL

14:45.152 --> 14:47.287
AND GET YOU CHECKED OUT.
I'M A PROFESSIONAL!

14:47.320 --> 14:49.156
I HAVEN'T HAD
A SINGLE COMPLICATION

14:49.189 --> 14:52.025
IN ANY OF MY PREGNANCIES
UNTIL...

14:52.059 --> 14:54.327
(inhales deeply and whispers)
UNTIL...

14:54.361 --> 14:56.063
UNTIL WHAT?

14:56.096 --> 14:59.599
UNTIL CHATSWIN!

14:59.632 --> 15:00.600
(sighs)

15:06.239 --> 15:08.208
WE'RE--WE'RE GONNA GO
TO THE HOSPITAL TO CHECK IT OUT.
(grunts and inhales deeply)

15:08.241 --> 15:09.609
(keys jangle)
MEET US THERE?

15:09.642 --> 15:11.644
(exhales deeply and grunts)
(George and Tessa) OKAY.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.446
(grunts)
OH. THANK YOU, TESS.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.714
(panting)
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, DAD.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.383
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS THERE.
OKAY.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.717
OKAY, I'M GONNA MEET YOU
AT THE AMBULANCE, ALL RIGHT?

15:17.750 --> 15:18.618
GEORGE,
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.719
DUDE, I KNOW YOU WANT TO,

15:19.752 --> 15:21.288
BUT YOU AND JILL STRESS
EDEN OUT.

15:21.321 --> 15:24.457
EDEN? MY BABY IS IN THERE.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.959
YOU ARE HIGH AS A KITE
IF YOU THINK THAT

15:25.993 --> 15:27.494
I'M JUST GONNA SIT HOME
AND CROSS MY FINGERS

15:27.527 --> 15:29.629
AND HOPE THAT
EVERYTHING TURNS OUT OKAY.

15:29.662 --> 15:30.497
COULD YOU DO THAT?

15:30.530 --> 15:32.032
OKAY, FOLLOW, DUDE.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.566
FOLLOW IN YOUR CAR,
BUT KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.469
I'VE BEEN KEEPING
A SAFE DISTANCE, DUDE.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.570
LOOK WHERE IT GOT US.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.373
(violins playing
"One Hundred Ways")

15:43.676 --> 15:47.180
WHAT'S ALL THIS, FRED?

15:47.214 --> 15:52.185
(gasps)
* IF IT'S VIOLINS
SHE LOVES *

15:52.219 --> 15:54.054
* LET THEM PLAY

15:54.087 --> 15:55.555
* HEY, HEY

15:55.588 --> 15:58.225

* DEDICATE

16:00.060 --> 16:02.295
* HER FAVORITE SONG

16:02.329 --> 16:03.430
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.

16:06.366 --> 16:09.302
* ALL NIGHT LONG

16:09.336 --> 16:11.704
* LOVE HER TODAY

16:11.738 --> 16:15.542
* FIND ONE HUNDRED WAYS

16:15.575 --> 16:18.011
JAMES?
SHEILA?

16:18.045 --> 16:19.646
(music stops)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:19.679 --> 16:20.647
YOUR HUSBAND HIRED ME.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.182
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.184
I JUST DIDN'T THINK
I'D EVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.518
(gulps)

16:25.552 --> 16:26.819
SO HOW YOU BEEN?

16:26.853 --> 16:29.356
UH...

16:29.389 --> 16:32.325
I-I-I'VE BEEN GREAT.
(stammers)

16:32.359 --> 16:34.027
YOU LOOK GOOD...

16:34.061 --> 16:35.728
(whispers) WITH YOUR FINE ASS.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.397
THANKS, JIMMY. (chuckles)

16:37.430 --> 16:39.466
UH, O-OKAY. I'M CONFUSED.
I-I THOUGHT JAMES INGRAM WAS

16:39.499 --> 16:41.534
YOUR FAVORITE
SOUL RECORDING ARTIST.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.171
HE IS...

16:44.204 --> 16:48.141
AND WE DATED BRIEFLY,
BEFORE YOU AND I MET.

16:48.175 --> 16:52.212
OKAY. YOU DATED JAMES INGRAM?
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS?!

16:52.245 --> 16:54.214
I THINK WE SHOULD GO.

16:54.247 --> 16:58.351
(Milo Greene's "1957" playing)

16:58.385 --> 17:00.720
JAMES INGRAM WASN'T
THE ONLY SECRET

17:00.753 --> 17:03.623
SHEILA HAD BEEN KEEPING.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.459
* OH-OH, OH-OH

17:06.493 --> 17:10.463
* OH-OH, OH-OH, OH, OH

17:15.135 --> 17:15.668
* OH-OH, OH-OH

17:15.702 --> 17:17.804
O-POSITIVE?

17:17.837 --> 17:19.806
THAT'S TECHNICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.242
* OH, OH

17:24.444 --> 17:25.712
IT'S NOT ME. IT'S HIM.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.115
* TAKES ME AWAY

17:28.148 --> 17:30.650
* TAKES ME AWAY

17:30.683 --> 17:32.885
HEY. EVERYTHING OKAY?

17:32.919 --> 17:33.886
YEAH. FALSE LABOR.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.155
AND THE BABY?

17:35.188 --> 17:36.623
WILL BE FINE.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.657
(sighs)

17:37.690 --> 17:41.394
HEY, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THE INTERNSHIP?

17:41.428 --> 17:42.862
WHAT?

17:42.895 --> 17:45.665
YOU DIDN'T GET THE INTERNSHIP
AT "THE VILLAGE VOICE."

17:45.698 --> 17:48.335
THE REJECTION LETTER FELL OUT
OF YOUR COAT POCKET.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.370
THAT'S HOW I KNOW.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.839
OH. WELL, I GUESS I FORGOT.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.741
* ARE OLD AND CHIPPING

17:54.774 --> 17:56.576
YOU MUST BE PRETTY BUMMED.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.678
NO.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.547
NO? DISAPPOINTED?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.449
(chuckles) NOT REALLY.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.185
I'LL FIND SOMETHING ELSE.
YOU KNOW ME.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.553
* TAKES ME AWAY

18:06.586 --> 18:07.887
DO I?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.822
OJO DEL PIES!

18:09.856 --> 18:12.392
WHAT? CARMEN?
(panting)

18:12.425 --> 18:14.761
MISS DALLAS
IN THE GOLDEN SNEAKERS...

18:14.794 --> 18:16.863
(voice breaks) SHE BROKE
THE EYE OF HER FOOT!

18:16.896 --> 18:19.799
OKAY. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE OKAY.
(sighs)

18:19.832 --> 18:21.401
AY, MENTIROSA!

18:21.434 --> 18:22.869
I-I'M--I'M COMING WITH YOU.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.637
I'M JUST...

18:24.671 --> 18:26.273
TESSA... (sighs)
MR. ALTMAN?

18:26.306 --> 18:27.774
YEAH.
EDEN'S ASKING FOR YOU.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.410
SHE'S NOT BEING HONEST
WITH ME, IS SHE?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.512
I HAVE NO IDEA.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.815
I'VE NEVER MET
EITHER ONE OF YOU.

18:35.848 --> 18:40.287
(whispers) RIGHT.

18:40.320 --> 18:40.853
(sighs)

18:40.887 --> 18:42.489
HEY. DALLAS.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.924
WAKE UP.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.660
YAKULT? IS THAT YOU?

18:47.694 --> 18:49.162
OH, IT'S ME, ALL RIGHT.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.164
THE QUESTION IS,
DALLAS, IS THAT YOU?

18:51.198 --> 18:54.167
YAKULT, SO CRYPTIC.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.603
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU TRYING
TO PROVE OUT THERE TODAY, GIRL?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.805
THAT I'M FAST
AND THAT I'M STRONG

18:58.838 --> 19:01.574
AND THAT I DON'T NEED
ANYBODY BUT MYSELF.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.911
YOU CRAZY? YOU NEED THAT CHILD
AS MUCH AS SHE NEEDS YOU.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.679
WHO? TESSA?

19:06.713 --> 19:08.781
BITCH, AIN'T NOBODY TALKIN'
'BOUT TESSA.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.350
(door opens)
(gasps and whispers) TESSA.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.719
(normal voice)
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.187
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

19:14.221 --> 19:14.921
MM-HMM.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.290
WILL YOU CALL DALIA FOR ME

19:17.324 --> 19:18.858
AND TELL HER
TO COME BACK HOME?

19:18.891 --> 19:21.861
OKAY.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.996
DO YOU WANT ME TO SIT
WITH YOU FOR A WHILE?

19:24.030 --> 19:26.633
I SHOULD'VE MADE HER STAY.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.538
(sighs)

19:31.571 --> 19:33.406
(lowered voice)
EL PERCOCET.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.511
DALLAS WANTED TO SEE
HER DAUGHTER,

19:38.545 --> 19:41.414
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
THAT HURT MY FEELINGS,

19:41.448 --> 19:44.351
BUT IT DID.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.719
THEY SAY A TREE IS KNOWN
BY ITS FRUIT.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.222
(Lykke Li's "Possibility"
playing)

19:49.256 --> 19:52.692
BEFORE WE MOVED HERE, I SWEAR,
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT HER...

19:52.725 --> 19:54.561
(speaks inaudibly)

19:54.594 --> 19:57.830
* THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

19:57.864 --> 19:59.266
BUT MOTHER'S DAY IN CHATSWIN

19:59.299 --> 20:02.435
MADE ONE THING
PAINFULLY CLEAR...

20:02.469 --> 20:04.504
* THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

20:04.537 --> 20:06.639
THE FEELING WAS MUTUAL.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.941
**

20:08.975 --> 20:10.843
MY MOM NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT ME, EITHER.

20:10.877 --> 20:14.013
* ALL THAT I HAD

20:14.046 --> 20:18.618
* WAS ALL I'M GONNA GET

20:18.651 --> 20:26.726
* MM-MM-MM-MM

20:26.759 --> 20:34.834
* THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

20:34.867 --> 20:37.804
* THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

20:37.837 --> 20:39.639
(woman) TESSA?

20:39.672 --> 20:42.709
**

20:42.742 --> 20:46.646
I RECOGNIZED HER FACE
FROM THE PHOTOS--

20:46.679 --> 20:48.348
MY MOTHER'S MOTHER.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.418
* IS GONNA BE YOURS THEN

20:51.451 --> 20:55.021
* ALL I'M GONNA GET

20:55.054 --> 20:58.925
* IS GONNA BE YOURS STILL

21:01.594 --> 21:08.000
* SO TELL ME WHEN YOU HEAR
MY HEART STOP *

21:08.034 --> 21:09.436
SHE WAS LOOKING
AT THE GRANDCHILD

21:09.469 --> 21:10.703
SHE NEVER KNEW...

21:10.737 --> 21:12.839
* YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

21:12.872 --> 21:14.507
BUT ME?

21:14.541 --> 21:16.042
I WAS LOOKING AT A WAY OUT.

21:18.511 --> 21:24.717
* TELL ME WHEN YOU HEAR
MY SILENCE *

21:24.751 --> 21:26.986
* MM-MM-MM

21:27.019 --> 21:29.489
* MM-MM-MM-MM
