WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:04.838
I want to understand.
How will you move our money?

00:04.921 --> 00:07.799
Well, I can be on site within 12 hours

00:07.882 --> 00:11.803
to begin withdrawing funds
from your Caracas accounts.

00:11.886 --> 00:14.597
I convert to bonds as an air gap safeguard

00:14.681 --> 00:17.976
so the liquid capital
cannot be electronically tracked.

00:18.059 --> 00:20.103
I then reconvert for deposit

00:20.186 --> 00:22.981
and the funds
are controlled here digitally.

00:23.064 --> 00:25.734
You can access your accounts
from anywhere.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.652
What guarantees do we have?

00:28.611 --> 00:30.697
Of safety? Security?

00:30.780 --> 00:34.659
-Your reputation precedes you, but--
-We are not men you fail.

00:35.535 --> 00:39.998
Gentlemen, nobody can rob a bank
that's always on the move.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.506
Our portfolios.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.426
You protect them with your life.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.511
You understand?

00:54.012 --> 00:54.888
I do.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.312
I shall begin setting up
your accounts immediately.

01:02.395 --> 01:06.232
In the meantime,
an attendant will be in with beverages.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.400
[dramatic music playing]

01:48.191 --> 01:51.861
Mierce has worked wonders for you, Weecha.

01:51.945 --> 01:56.449
Your recovery so far
is absolutely remarkable.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.661
What you both have accomplished
is a miracle.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.914
Maybe it's time to get back to work?

02:02.997 --> 02:07.669
Weecha. You were nearly dead a week ago.
You need to continue to rest.

02:07.752 --> 02:08.795
Eat good food.

02:08.878 --> 02:09.921
Take naps.

02:10.004 --> 02:12.465
Read a book. Listen to music.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.217
I belong out there with you.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.345
You belong here
getting stronger with your sister.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.805
If she'll stay.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.311
I'm getting the cold shoulder.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.731
She told me she still thinks
this place is no good.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.941
For whom?

02:30.024 --> 02:31.442
Any of us.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.735
She needs time.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.447
She said that a fire ceremony
may help guide her path.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.574
A fire ceremony?

02:37.657 --> 02:38.741
In an Airstream?

02:38.825 --> 02:41.077
Exactly what does one of those entail?

02:41.161 --> 02:45.206
-Can you can do it outside on the grill?
-Raymond. Stop it.

02:45.290 --> 02:49.252
She said she needs to consult
the other side for guidance.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.670
Who on the other side?

02:50.753 --> 02:53.214
And what other side?
Mierce, we're right here.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.966
-[knocking on door]
-Yes!

02:56.551 --> 02:58.595
-Marvin.
-Hello. Oh.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.473
Oh. This must be the famous Mierce.

03:02.557 --> 03:03.975
Hello, I'm Marvin.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.935
Raymond has told me so much about you,

03:06.019 --> 03:08.479
and how glad he is that you're back.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.398
Raymond says a lot of things.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.452
Did I come at a bad time?

03:22.535 --> 03:27.123
I've experienced hostage situations
that are less tense than this trailer.

03:27.206 --> 03:31.961
I keep visiting and the trailer seems
to keep getting smaller and smaller and...

03:32.587 --> 03:34.797
I don't know, I guess time will tell.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.300
Keep your fingers, legs and eyes crossed.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.595
But I sent you on a chase. I hope
it wasn't of the "wild goose" variety.

03:40.678 --> 03:41.679
Uh...

03:42.513 --> 03:45.767
This is a statement
of the bank account in question.

03:45.850 --> 03:49.145
The same one used to pay for the murders
of the Lacroixs and Reggie Cole.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.230
You were right.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.232
It's an account at Caelum Bank.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.399
Heaven's vault.

03:53.483 --> 03:57.487
Marvin, I haven't done any banking
with Harris Gramercy in, what?

03:57.570 --> 03:58.488
Years.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.782
No new accounts have been opened.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.701
You still hold several accounts
on that plane.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.495
Those are still active?

04:05.578 --> 04:07.205
Yeah. We never closed them.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.540
No place is safer for those funds.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.458
Fair point.

04:10.541 --> 04:14.921
Someone had access to this account
and paid for those murders.

04:15.004 --> 04:19.384
And they may also be responsible
for the death of Kate's sister, Maureen.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.177
The problem is it's a joint account.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.929
Electronic petty cash

04:23.012 --> 04:25.723
accessible worldwide
for operational expenses.

04:25.807 --> 04:29.602
Do you know how many of our people
had access? Where do we start?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.521
We start on the plane.

04:34.482 --> 04:38.778
The scary call is very much coming
from inside the house.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.572
So you reached out to me?

04:41.656 --> 04:45.827
Well, we've had experience
together with Caelum Bank.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.663
Before you take on Gramercy,
you better be sure.

04:48.746 --> 04:52.083
Someone paid for the deaths
of Reggie Cole,

04:52.166 --> 04:56.379
Tyson Lacroix, Michelle Lacroix,
and used a Reddington account to do it.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.173
This same someone
blackmailed Harold Cooper

04:59.257 --> 05:02.969
and is almost certainly responsible
for Elizabeth's death.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.680
And probably the same for Maureen Rowan.

05:06.514 --> 05:07.807
Look into my eyes.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.228
I believe every word of it.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.897
That's your assurance.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.191
It's a bank on a plane.

05:17.275 --> 05:20.236
Actually, several planes
with one main branch,

05:20.320 --> 05:22.238
with a man named Harris Gramercy

05:22.322 --> 05:24.574
as the chairman, president
and head teller.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.492
It operates like a ghost plane.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.202
No flight plans filed

05:28.286 --> 05:30.997
and no GPS transponder.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.165
On top of which,

05:32.248 --> 05:35.710
its onboard servers are protected
from outside interference

05:35.793 --> 05:39.672
with elliptic curve cryptography.
No one is hacking their way in.

05:39.756 --> 05:43.134
I've never been this close to an answer.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.928
I'm inches away, and I can't get it.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.306
I need Harris Gramercy

05:48.389 --> 05:50.600
to tell me who accessed that account.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.519
You and I both know
he's the only person who can.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.730
Caelum works under strict secrecy.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.649
Both the accounts and clients
are identified by numbers.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.235
Only verified clients may access accounts.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.781
Val Messick was paid
to kill the Lacroixs and Cole.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.867
He was paid
with Reddington's account 4626329.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.661
So we just need the number
of the client who accessed it.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.623
That's not gonna be enough.
We need to match a number to a name.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.250
You can't force Gramercy to give you info.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.835
Who said anything about forcing?

06:17.919 --> 06:20.421
By the time I'm finished,
he'll give me what I want.

06:20.505 --> 06:24.092
You're gonna run a con
on the president of Caelum Bank?

06:24.175 --> 06:28.304
I can't very well put a gun to his head.
Not with the friends he has.

06:28.387 --> 06:32.558
Once we get him on the ground,
I'm sure Harris will be reasonable.

06:32.642 --> 06:36.312
If we help you with this,
once this is over, the FBI keeps him.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.064
Whatever. What do I care?

06:38.147 --> 06:39.357
You're losing focus.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.652
Gramercy isn't the goal.
Finding Elizabeth's killer is.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.113
My focus is clearing Cooper's name.

06:45.196 --> 06:49.784
If the information on that plane helps
to vindicate that man, that's my goal.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.619
So how do we ground him?

06:51.702 --> 06:53.412
Raymond has a plan.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.499
But the FAA isn't going to like it.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.546
Hey. Can we talk? I have news.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.382
Of course. But we need to get on it
to find this plane.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.843
Right. Sorry. I heard from Main Justice.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.136
They processed your review

07:08.219 --> 07:11.681
and they're revoking your field status
due to medical liabilities.

07:12.390 --> 07:16.018
I can't let you work this case,
at least not in the field.

07:17.937 --> 07:21.315
You know, I was talking
with a friend recently

07:21.399 --> 07:24.944
about the first time I ever
flew on this plane.

07:25.027 --> 07:27.488
That was a turbulent ride then.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.575
Of course,
that's also a turbulent friendship now.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.997
I guess no matter where you are,
you should prepare for rough air.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.041
Hmm. You have a lot of money in this bank,

07:39.125 --> 07:42.253
which is why I was obligated
to take this meeting.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.171
So...

07:44.297 --> 07:45.631
what can I do for you?

07:48.301 --> 07:49.719
I need a favor, Harris.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.975
Oh. What's this? A cricket score?

07:57.393 --> 07:58.769
You know what it is.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.731
You have every account on this plane

08:01.814 --> 08:06.569
locked up
in that safe deposit box mind of yours.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.946
That one belongs to me.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.909
I need the name of the last person
who made a withdrawal from that account.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.120
It's your account. You should know.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.747
It is my account.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.626
So you should have no problem
telling me who made the withdrawal.

08:21.709 --> 08:22.960
You know the rules.

08:23.044 --> 08:23.878
No names.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.796
-If my clients found out--
-I'm a client.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.507
It's my money.

08:28.674 --> 08:29.926
Why would anyone else care?

08:30.009 --> 08:33.262
If I were to give out one name,
the perception would be

08:33.346 --> 08:35.806
that I'm likely to give out others.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.560
If someone is accessing your money,
it's because they had permission from you.

08:39.644 --> 08:44.190
If you don't know who that is, I'm afraid
there's nothing else I can tell you.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.358
[tracker beeping]

08:45.816 --> 08:47.318
[Ressler] <i>How's the tracker?</i>

08:47.401 --> 08:49.904
We've got him pinpointed within a meter.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.197
You want me to what?

08:51.280 --> 08:55.493
Under Title 2 of the Intelligence Reform
and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004,

08:55.576 --> 08:58.996
the FBI has authority to investigate
threats to national security pursuant--

08:59.080 --> 09:00.623
What language are you speaking?

09:00.706 --> 09:02.667
As acting director of an FBI task force,

09:02.750 --> 09:05.503
I have a credible threat
of terrorist action to U.S. Route 1.

09:05.586 --> 09:09.215
-The Overseas Highway?
-Ground all flight traffic now.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.134
I've got six flights leaving Key West.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.178
I've got a billionaire landing
in Key Largo,

09:14.262 --> 09:16.055
and I got a soccer team in Marathon.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.598
-You want me--?
-Ground them all.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.518
Or my next call will be to the Air Force.

09:20.601 --> 09:24.021
We can start with a plane
that's not on your ground radar.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.481
I have its coordinates.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.484
[pilot] <i>Uh, excuse me, sir.</i>

09:28.568 --> 09:33.698
<i>We were just informed we're currently over</i>
<i>United States air space and must land.</i>

09:33.781 --> 09:35.366
Have they told you why?

09:35.449 --> 09:39.537
<i>No. But we were encouraged to comply</i>
<i>under threat of the U.S. Air Force.</i>

09:39.620 --> 09:41.789
Well, then, by all means, comply.

09:41.872 --> 09:42.707
<i>Copy that.</i>

09:43.833 --> 09:45.960
[clears throat]
Perhaps we should drink up.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.753
Is this a problem?

09:47.837 --> 09:49.046
Mm.

09:49.130 --> 09:53.968
No, nothing that a little talk or time,
or perhaps a small donation can't fix.

09:56.470 --> 10:00.850
I'm not entirely comfortable
with an unscheduled stop like this.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.978
It's better than an F-16 blasting
us out of the sky.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.354
This feels unsafe.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.814
Please fix it promptly.

10:06.897 --> 10:10.318
I just need a moment to speak
to whoever's in charge.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.695
FBI!

10:12.778 --> 10:16.282
We have a credible threat.
Had to ground all air traffic.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.159
If you gentlemen will give us a second,

10:18.242 --> 10:20.494
we'll inspect your plane
and have you on your way.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.580
Happy to assist a U.S. agency.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.376
Wait, I know your face.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.588
I know who you are.
You're Raymond Reddington.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.548
Me? I don't know that name.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.092
Redmund Rillington? I don't know.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.219
[Ressler]
Everyone on this plane is under arrest.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.513
[Raymond] What the hell is happening here?

10:47.563 --> 10:48.814
Hello, Val.

10:48.898 --> 10:49.732
How you been?

10:50.691 --> 10:52.652
You're the fed who arrested me.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.320
So what?

10:54.403 --> 10:57.281
You come to personally
escort me to detention?

10:57.365 --> 10:58.491
See this?

10:59.116 --> 11:00.534
I'm not escorting you anywhere.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.244
You're not going to jail.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.455
This is a transfer order
to Witness Protection

11:04.538 --> 11:07.375
because you snitched
on the people who hired you.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.043
I didn't say anything.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.630
This says you did.

11:12.713 --> 11:16.384
We had you on triple homicide,
so you must've really given up the goods.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.886
-What are you doing?
-You get handed over to WitSec,

11:18.969 --> 11:21.680
they begin your paperwork for induction,

11:21.764 --> 11:24.308
that process is long enough
that anyone paying attention,

11:24.392 --> 11:29.021
like the person who hired you
can get word that you snitched.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.190
Then WitSec follows up with me,

11:31.273 --> 11:35.236
and I suddenly have no record
of you helping on an active case.

11:35.319 --> 11:38.656
That's when you're cooling
your heels in central detention.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.117
You, a known snitch, sitting in gen pop

11:41.200 --> 11:44.328
the length of time it takes
for me to make up my mind.

11:44.995 --> 11:46.122
That's a death sentence.

11:46.205 --> 11:49.458
I'm a man with a lot to lose.
I don't care about you.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.711
Now, I could misplace this piece of paper.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.880
Then you go to trial
like you're supposed to

11:54.964 --> 11:56.674
and no one is the wiser.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.468
Triple homicide?
You'll be big man on campus.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.471
You might even make some friends
to keep you safe.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.599
What do you wanna know?

12:05.683 --> 12:08.853
Who hired you and everything
you were paid to do. Spare no detail.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.897
I never got a name.
You know what I was paid to do.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.693
This van is leaving in five minutes, Val.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.903
Where do you want it to take you?

12:19.029 --> 12:19.989
Okay.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.575
There was one thing.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.830
After I killed Michelle Lacroix,
I was supposed to go to the Lacroix house.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.165
But you arrested me first.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.083
And do what at the house?

12:31.167 --> 12:32.543
Burn it to the ground.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.962
And start the fire near Lacroix's desk.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.844
I've had nightmares that begin this way.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.888
I'm in federal custody.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.848
My plane impounded...

12:46.849 --> 12:49.935
full of the most sensitive
banking data in the world.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.316
-What the hell are we gonna do?
-Calm down.

12:55.399 --> 12:58.027
Federal or not, they're all just cops.

12:58.986 --> 13:01.155
-I can get us out of here.
-How?

13:01.238 --> 13:03.616
Haven't been given our phone call yet.

13:03.699 --> 13:04.533
A while ago,

13:04.617 --> 13:08.329
I won a game of roque against
the lieutenant governor of Florida.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.831
He owes me a huge favor.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.542
One call gets the both of us out of here.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.460
Or just me.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.378
I'm not giving up a client to you.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.964
If the FBI starts poking
around that plane,

13:19.048 --> 13:21.258
-you'll be giving up more than that.
-Oh.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.594
You're a real villain, aren't you?

13:23.677 --> 13:26.972
This villain can have you airborne
within the hour.

13:27.056 --> 13:31.143
<i>One name seems a small price</i>
<i>to pay for your freedom.</i>

13:31.227 --> 13:32.144
[Harris] <i>You know what?</i>

13:32.811 --> 13:36.232
This situation,
as sudden and horrible as it is,

13:36.315 --> 13:40.611
seems to have greatly improved
your ability to make requests, hasn't it?

13:40.694 --> 13:42.196
What are you trying to say?

13:42.279 --> 13:46.158
Under no circumstances known to God or man
will I cooperate.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.536
Well, now you're being unreasonable.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.829
It doesn't expose any of your clients

13:50.913 --> 13:55.000
to tell me about a transfer
from my own account.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.545
No, it exposes me.

13:57.628 --> 14:00.714
Because I represent something. Trust.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.007
<i>Trust in me.</i>

14:02.091 --> 14:03.259
<i>Trust in my bank.</i>

14:03.342 --> 14:05.636
People come to me,
not just to protect their money,

14:05.719 --> 14:09.598
but to protect their secrets
and I do not divulge names.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.016
I am a man of my word.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.435
And I'm a man of mine.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.354
You should reconsider, Harris.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.606
-Is that a threat?
-I'm Redmund Rillington.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.651
I don't have to make threats.
I just have to speak.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.071
This entire arrest is a sham.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.490
Were those even real agents earlier?

14:26.574 --> 14:28.200
I've got nothing to fear.

14:28.784 --> 14:31.036
Just the man in this cell with you.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.707
It was a nice speech you gave.

14:34.790 --> 14:38.002
All that trust and trusting.

14:38.085 --> 14:41.005
But you're certainly
no paragon of virtue, Harris.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.966
I know where the money
in your bank comes from.

14:44.049 --> 14:47.469
<i>Criminals. War lords. Drug dealers.</i>

14:47.553 --> 14:50.931
Bankers and politicians
who've defrauded nations.

14:51.015 --> 14:54.184
Shall we find out if this 9 mm is a sham?

14:55.769 --> 14:56.979
Go to hell.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.816
Gee, guess it's a real gun after all.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.193
We have to get in there.

15:03.277 --> 15:06.238
That man may have the name
of the person who ordered Liz's murder.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.990
-So we do nothing?
-Give it a minute.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.910
I'm not losing sleep
over some criminal banker.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.203
Where are the police?

15:13.287 --> 15:15.080
Someone must've heard that.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.041
But you called it. There are no police.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.834
This isn't even an active station.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.546
That's why they brought us
in the back door. Just you and me.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.215
-I need an ambulance.
-I need a name.

15:27.134 --> 15:31.472
I keep a backup log of all transactions
with a colleague in Riga.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.849
Just numbers on paper.

15:33.933 --> 15:34.767
Oh, God.

15:36.143 --> 15:40.022
I didn't want it to play out like this,
but now that it has,

15:40.105 --> 15:41.649
just get me the name.

15:47.988 --> 15:48.822
It's me.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.493
<i>Ego confido in pecunia</i> 123.

15:52.576 --> 15:59.083
I need the transfer history
of account number 4626329.

15:59.166 --> 16:02.044
Just give me the last line details.

16:03.629 --> 16:07.091
Client 4836924. Got it.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.300
-Okay.
-Okay.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.928
4836924.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.847
You know who it is. Tell me.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.225
Hawkins.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.143
Hedwig Hawkins.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.479
Heddie?

16:21.897 --> 16:23.065
That can't be.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.901
Numbers don't lie.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.918
Wait, I need an ambulance.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.503
[Raymond] It'll be here.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.681
You followed me down here?

16:55.764 --> 16:58.434
You are absolutely incorrigible,
sweetheart.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.145
-Your sister allowed this?
-She didn't know I left.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.022
She was out shopping for her ceremony.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.232
Oh, my God. We are going to pay.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.609
At least give her a call.
Let her know you're safe.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.070
I told you you're not well enough yet.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.238
If something happens--

17:11.321 --> 17:14.324
You needed a ride. So sit back.

17:17.036 --> 17:17.870
Thank you.

17:23.709 --> 17:24.668
Jesus.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.422
This is Federal Agent Zuma.

17:28.505 --> 17:31.967
I need an ambulance for a gunshot wound
at Gulf and Aviation right now.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.511
His blood's dark.
I think the bullet hit his liver.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.679
Knew this would happen.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.057
-We got the name, didn't we?
-We did.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.100
God help Heddie.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.732
This is all from Lacroix's home office?

17:46.815 --> 17:50.110
I had an evidence team bag
every shelf and cabinet near his desk.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.072
That's where Val was told
to start the fire.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.241
Someone wanted to make sure
it burned more than anywhere else.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.994
I'll start at this end,
you start at that end.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.459
You know why I'm here helping you

18:05.542 --> 18:08.462
and not down in Florida
with the rest of the team?

18:08.962 --> 18:11.215
I figured you'd tell me
when you were comfortable.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.801
I've been demoted to a desk role.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.554
The headaches?

18:17.638 --> 18:19.389
I don't blame Aram.

18:19.473 --> 18:20.641
He only did what I asked.

18:20.724 --> 18:23.727
I was honest in my own review.
He did his job by submitting it.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.979
But I'm frustrated.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.691
Believe me, I know a thing or two
about feeling frustrated lately.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.070
We just keep working.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.325
How was Gramercy when you left?

18:38.408 --> 18:39.618
[Ressler] <i>Headed into surgery.</i>

18:39.701 --> 18:41.829
Lost a lot of blood. It was 50-50.

18:41.912 --> 18:45.499
Worse, he realized it was
a ruse before Raymond shot him.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.167
<i>He didn't think we were real FBI.</i>

18:47.251 --> 18:49.253
Which means we have to let him go.

18:49.336 --> 18:53.048
-It's the only way to protect Reddington.
-We need to protect Heddie.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.676
Is it conceivable
she could be behind any of this?

18:55.759 --> 18:59.263
All we have is an account that led
to her name. We don't know enough.

18:59.346 --> 19:02.141
Reddington will kill her.
He's already left one for dead.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.976
We need to keep Heddie alive.

19:04.059 --> 19:07.855
I told Raymond. This isn't just about
the person that ordered Elizabeth's death.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.023
It's also about that person
framing Harold.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.485
Dembe's right. Whatever Heddie knows,
whatever she's done,

19:13.569 --> 19:15.112
she's Cooper's best chance.

19:15.195 --> 19:17.030
We need to stay ahead of Reddington.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.826
-Does anyone know where Heddie is?
-She has a condo in Miami.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.704
There's a helipad in Islamorada.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.330
<i>I'll send a chopper.</i>

19:25.414 --> 19:27.499
[salsa music playing over speakers]

19:33.046 --> 19:34.256
[cell phone buzzing]

19:36.758 --> 19:38.510
[tense music playing]

19:49.938 --> 19:51.273
Want that one?

19:51.356 --> 19:53.025
What a good girl!

19:53.108 --> 19:55.402
One more strawberry. Do you want that one?

19:58.572 --> 20:01.074
All I can hear right now
is Heddie's laugh.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.327
All these years, that laugh.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.455
No, no, no.

20:07.164 --> 20:10.459
It's Heddie. I guarantee it's unlocked.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.802
She was just here.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.514
And then she was tipped off.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.685
Okay, I got out.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.562
[Dembe] <i>We'll be on the ground</i>
<i>in five minutes.</i>

20:30.646 --> 20:33.023
<i>We'll pick you up around the corner</i>
<i>at Flamingo Park.</i>

20:33.106 --> 20:34.441
I'm on my way.

20:35.651 --> 20:36.985
[Dembe] Is it true?

20:37.069 --> 20:40.155
Is what true?
I don't know what I'm being accused of.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.573
Did you have something to do

20:41.657 --> 20:43.200
-with Keen's death?
-What?

20:44.034 --> 20:45.285
How could you--?

20:45.953 --> 20:47.496
Is that what you think?

20:47.579 --> 20:49.498
Is that what Raymond thinks?

20:49.581 --> 20:51.667
I don't know what's going on here,

20:51.750 --> 20:54.795
but I never did anything
to hurt Elizabeth.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.296
You have to believe me.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.925
-Dembe. Come on.
-[cell phone ringing]

21:00.467 --> 21:01.885
Actually, Heddie,

21:01.969 --> 21:04.471
he's the one you'll have to convince.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.809
-Raymond.
-I know you have her.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.269
We're trying to keep her safe.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.230
You know what
she could be responsible for?

21:13.313 --> 21:15.941
<i>Raymond, you're blinded</i>
<i>by anger right now.</i>

21:16.024 --> 21:18.193
You'd execute her
before you can get answers.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.530
Harold is counting on those answers.
So is the rest of the FBI.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.323
And so are you.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.575
<i>You cannot kill Heddie</i>
<i>before you get the truth.</i>

21:25.659 --> 21:27.411
I'll tell you what this reminds me of.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.289
The coast of Madagascar in 2010,

21:30.372 --> 21:33.083
<i>on that stunning Spirit sloop.</i>

21:33.166 --> 21:35.961
<i>All that beautiful mahogany brightwork.</i>

21:36.044 --> 21:37.838
What was it, 80, 90 feet?

21:37.921 --> 21:39.381
A hundred and eleven.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.093
And then we saw the skiffs.

21:43.176 --> 21:45.012
<i>Pirates out of Nacala.</i>

21:45.095 --> 21:47.639
<i>I wanted to fight. We were armed for it.</i>

21:47.723 --> 21:49.182
<i>High seas adventure.</i>

21:49.266 --> 21:51.143
But you insisted we stand down.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.103
What was it you said to me?

21:53.812 --> 21:58.066
Surrendering loses us nothing we'll miss
but gives them the world.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.985
Not one shot was fired.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.821
They took the boat, the brandy,
my Sea-Dweller.

22:02.904 --> 22:05.115
<i>-I loved that watch.</i>
-You got another.

22:05.198 --> 22:08.827
<i>Spent six hours,</i>
<i>us and the crew, in a tiny life raft.</i>

22:08.910 --> 22:14.291
Ah. Dembe, I've always respected
your level-headedness.

22:14.374 --> 22:20.047
Your refusal to just say "yes."
Your willingness to put me in my place.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.966
I hardly see how what I said then
applies to now.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.970
I don't either. I was just killing time
till we caught up with you.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.072
Hello, Heddie. Let's go.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.656
-All right, come on.
-[groans]

22:46.740 --> 22:48.158
[tires screeching]

23:01.213 --> 23:03.173
Harold, take a look at this.

23:05.383 --> 23:08.178
Lacroix had
a hell of a movie collection, right?

23:08.261 --> 23:09.971
Then I opened this one.

23:12.557 --> 23:16.144
There's some minor security here.
Just a password protection.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.979
Give me a minute to go ahead and--

23:18.063 --> 23:19.898
Here we go. It's loading now.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.109
So, what is it?

23:22.192 --> 23:24.820
A digitized record
of payment of some kind.

23:24.903 --> 23:28.824
Both Lacroix and Reggie Cole were involved
in those civil settlement shakedowns.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.243
-Could this be that?
-A lot of names here.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.620
That must've been bigger
than Lacroix and Cole.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.956
Let's look for the names
with the biggest numbers.

23:36.706 --> 23:40.127
Here, Lawrence Knell and Angela Sherwood.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.253
Who are they?

23:41.336 --> 23:44.756
Angela Sherwood for sure and--
Yup, Knell too.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.424
Lawyers at the same law firm.

23:46.508 --> 23:48.301
Let's find out what they know.

23:51.429 --> 23:52.681
Where are you headed?

23:52.764 --> 23:54.558
We got a lead. Maybe promising.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.476
-We don't know yet.
-Can I come with you?

23:56.560 --> 23:59.646
-You don't know what you're walking into.
-I can't.

23:59.729 --> 24:03.567
It'd be a violation of Bureau protocol
and I have to pay attention to that now.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.069
I'm sorry, Alina,
but you're out of the field.

24:11.575 --> 24:12.993
[Marvin] I can't believe this.

24:13.076 --> 24:16.580
Gramercy died in surgery two hours ago
of a gunshot wound.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.541
Collateral damage
was always a possibility.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.627
News is spreading like wildfire,
and his people knew

24:22.711 --> 24:25.839
that he was meeting with you.
I've got half the criminal underworld

24:25.922 --> 24:29.050
asking me if my boss
murdered the head of Caelum Bank.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.553
-Do you understand?
-I do. I don't care.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.138
I have what I was after.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.266
-And I'm bringing her back.
<i>-Her?</i>

24:36.349 --> 24:38.018
It was Heddie, Marvin.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.395
All roads led to Heddie.

24:40.478 --> 24:43.899
And so help me,
she will atone for her sins.

24:43.982 --> 24:48.028
<i>I'm taking her to the warehouse where</i>
<i>I'm going to get to know my friend Heddie.</i>

24:48.111 --> 24:51.364
If that's the case, I might be
able to add to your interrogation.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.282
How so?

24:52.365 --> 24:56.786
You asked me to look into that account.
That wasn't the only digging I did.

24:56.870 --> 25:00.624
I don't wanna speak too soon.
I have to confirm something first.

25:00.707 --> 25:05.545
But I may have a special guest
for you by the time you're back.

25:06.254 --> 25:08.340
We'll be there in three hours.

25:15.347 --> 25:18.433
We have your names here.
We have dollar amounts.

25:19.517 --> 25:22.437
Reginald Cole was bringing cases
to Tyson Lacroix

25:22.520 --> 25:25.065
who fraudulently settled
those cases and kept the money.

25:25.148 --> 25:28.026
If the two of you weren't involved,
then you knew about it.

25:28.109 --> 25:29.778
-How long--?
-Stop.

25:29.861 --> 25:33.198
We know we're screwed. We knew the minute
you showed up at the firm.

25:33.281 --> 25:34.366
[Sherwood] We'll deal.

25:34.449 --> 25:37.077
Statutory immunity
and we'll tell you what we know.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.620
This isn't difficult.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.747
-Give me a sample.
-[Sherwood] We can give names.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.582
More names than are in that document.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.834
Lacroix kept records
but he wasn't Claudius.

25:44.918 --> 25:48.213
We can't give you Claudius, though.
We don't have that information.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.257
Claudius? Who is that?

25:50.882 --> 25:54.511
The mastermind. The architect
of the whole damn spider's web.

25:54.594 --> 25:56.930
-He dreamed the whole thing up.
-Forcing settlements

25:57.013 --> 26:00.517
while never repping the clients
and pocketing all the money?

26:00.600 --> 26:01.601
It was genius.

26:01.685 --> 26:05.605
Every one of us kicked back
a percentage of every case to Claudius.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.941
There must've been a way
you kept in touch.

26:08.024 --> 26:11.194
Everything was anonymous e-mails,
burner phones.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.405
Real cloak-and-dagger type stuff.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.949
[Knell] I never believed
there was a Claudius.

26:16.032 --> 26:19.995
Somebody, somewhere would say
they met him or her. But I never did.

26:20.078 --> 26:20.996
Me, neither.

26:21.663 --> 26:24.124
Like I said, we can give you other names.

26:24.207 --> 26:26.835
[Knell] But we can't help you
with the name you want.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.547
Raymond, I'm innocent.

26:30.630 --> 26:33.675
I don't understand
what's going on, but I'm--

26:33.758 --> 26:37.470
No. Please, I've heard every variation

26:37.554 --> 26:40.307
on that theme before
and I don't wanna hear it.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.933
No more bloviating.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.144
What does that mean?

26:45.770 --> 26:49.024
It means I could wax poetic
about the nature of betrayal

26:49.107 --> 26:51.401
or be begging your forgiveness.

26:51.484 --> 26:54.738
And you know what?
Either way, I talk too much.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.906
And so do you. I'm tired.

26:57.490 --> 27:00.535
So please, do me a favor, and shut up.

27:00.618 --> 27:01.786
[grunts]

27:05.415 --> 27:06.666
What have you done?

27:06.750 --> 27:10.045
<i>You know everything we're looking for</i>
<i>depends on Heddie.</i>

27:10.128 --> 27:12.172
You almost killed Dembe and Ressler.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.840
I most certainly did not.

27:13.923 --> 27:17.802
The airbags deployed
and their egos were bruised.

27:17.886 --> 27:20.597
You can't say that for Harris Gramercy,
I found out.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.724
That was poor luck.

27:22.807 --> 27:26.019
But it provided me
with one of the answers I'm looking for.

27:26.936 --> 27:29.356
If you kill that woman,
we'll lose everything valuable

27:29.439 --> 27:31.566
she has to say about
all that's been going on,

27:31.649 --> 27:34.069
<i>including how to find</i>
<i>this mastermind Claudius.</i>

27:34.152 --> 27:38.073
I could never let her testify
in open court, Harold. You know that.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.784
-What are you gonna do?
<i>-Hold my own trial.</i>

27:40.867 --> 27:43.703
Don't worry,
I'll get answers for the both of us.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.080
You can count on it.

27:45.872 --> 27:49.751
Agent Park, are you here
to make a claim for Heddie, as well?

27:49.834 --> 27:51.419
I came to ask a favor.

27:52.837 --> 27:57.509
I have a lot on my mind this evening.
But what can I do for you?

27:57.592 --> 28:00.053
I wanna help. With all that's going on--

28:00.136 --> 28:04.140
-You want a job?
-Not a job. Just to stay a part of this.

28:04.224 --> 28:08.395
If you're close to Keen's killer,
I'm good at what I do.

28:08.478 --> 28:11.648
Hmm. That's quite a bold line
for me to cross.

28:11.731 --> 28:13.817
I admit I've made that leap before,

28:13.900 --> 28:16.820
but at the moment,
I'm swimming in hot water

28:16.903 --> 28:19.447
with Harold and the FBI as it is.

28:19.531 --> 28:23.159
The FBI doesn't want me anymore.
They've made that clear.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.081
Alina, I can see you're suffering.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.292
And with your maladies as they are,

28:31.376 --> 28:37.549
there's no task I can afford
or even feel right about offering you.

28:37.632 --> 28:40.218
I've had about all I can stand
of people telling me

28:40.301 --> 28:42.387
what I can and can't do.

28:42.470 --> 28:45.140
Sorry. I've made
enough mistakes for one day.

28:45.223 --> 28:49.602
-You're making another one right now.
-I can't help you today, Agent Park.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.858
I need to attend
to another matter at hand.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.443
[yelps]

29:05.869 --> 29:06.953
Are you all right?

29:11.458 --> 29:14.419
I'm fine. I can take care of myself.

29:15.628 --> 29:17.630
[Weecha] Raymond, Heddie is waking up.

29:21.342 --> 29:22.635
[Raymond] We'll talk tomorrow.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.848
You should exit out the back.

29:38.943 --> 29:39.861
This is it.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.864
Not one stone has been unturned.

29:43.531 --> 29:46.284
The lawyers were a dead end.
Reddington has Heddie.

29:46.367 --> 29:47.410
We can't give up.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.621
I appreciate your faith.

29:49.704 --> 29:52.582
-But what else is there to do?
-Do it all again.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.210
All of this?

29:55.293 --> 29:58.713
Park found that record on a disc
somewhere where it wasn't supposed to be.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.132
What else is here that we might've missed?

30:02.967 --> 30:05.428
-We didn't miss anything.
-Wanna bet your life on that?

30:06.137 --> 30:07.931
Or wanna help me look again?

30:22.987 --> 30:25.156
Didn't expect anyone to be here.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.116
I guess I just love my job.

30:27.200 --> 30:31.162
Double-checking Tyson Lacroix's
entire John Grisham movie collection.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.331
You've been gone a while. You okay?

30:34.415 --> 30:37.418
I went to Reddington
and offered him my help.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.879
Don't worry, he rejected me too.

30:40.505 --> 30:43.132
-I don't have a place there, either.
-Of course not.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.718
Because your place is with us.

30:46.219 --> 30:48.429
Desk work doesn't have
the thrill of the field,

30:48.513 --> 30:51.474
but what we do in here,
it saves lives too.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.853
Help save mine.
Right now, I could really use you.

30:57.105 --> 31:01.150
Here. Take the other half of this pile.
I think I'm going cross-eyed.

31:05.321 --> 31:10.034
Marvin will be back in a moment.
Now is the time to speak freely.

31:10.118 --> 31:13.955
You think that I had something
to do with Elizabeth's death?

31:15.748 --> 31:18.459
But why? What reason would I have?

31:18.543 --> 31:22.797
History's full of unlikely characters
in unlikely events.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.384
But how? The coordination alone,

31:26.467 --> 31:29.596
forget about the planning,
and you never found out?

31:29.679 --> 31:31.723
That's something you believe?

31:31.806 --> 31:35.184
You either had help
or you helped someone else.

31:35.268 --> 31:36.603
Helped who?

31:36.686 --> 31:40.231
Or helped from who? From where?

31:40.315 --> 31:44.319
Do I look anything
other than hopelessly alone right now?

31:44.402 --> 31:47.238
Raymond, this is Micky Croft.

31:47.322 --> 31:50.491
Micky is the arms trade
along the Canadian border.

31:50.575 --> 31:51.910
Yes, I know who he is.

31:51.993 --> 31:55.455
Your reputation precedes you
as reasonable and reliable.

31:55.538 --> 31:56.372
Likewise.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.459
I was looking for any of our people
who might have been disloyal,

31:59.542 --> 32:01.920
maybe shopped around their services.

32:02.003 --> 32:04.756
And that's when I found Micky,
heard his story.

32:04.839 --> 32:08.343
She came to me--
Has to be three years ago now.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.887
Said she was looking
for employment opportunities.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.932
Said she was done with how you ran things.

32:14.599 --> 32:17.810
She showed me how you cook your books.

32:17.894 --> 32:21.064
-She's a real whiz with dodging tax law.
-Yes, she is.

32:21.147 --> 32:24.192
[Micky] I only listened 'cause I thought
she was all the way gone from you.

32:27.236 --> 32:28.112
Heddie.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.948
What do you want me to say?

32:32.450 --> 32:34.953
You never thought I was anything special.

32:35.703 --> 32:40.583
I was overlooked,
so I went hunting for work.

32:41.542 --> 32:44.712
Should I be killed
for wanting a better job?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.674
Micky, I appreciate you coming.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.258
I won't forget it.

32:49.759 --> 32:54.764
Now, if you wouldn't mind finding your way
back out to the comfort of Marvin's car...

32:55.640 --> 32:56.891
[Marvin] Thanks, Micky.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.319
Let's get on with it.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.615
It's late. Sun will be up soon.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.167
Make it quick.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.441
Do you want a moment?

33:47.567 --> 33:48.568
For what?

33:49.235 --> 33:52.488
Now we have to deal with the fact
that I killed Harris Gramercy.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.198
His clients will be out for blood.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.701
You wanna deal with that this minute?

33:56.784 --> 33:58.119
We'll fly to Latvia.

33:58.661 --> 34:02.290
Several of his biggest clients
are based thereabouts.

34:02.373 --> 34:06.002
If we can call a meeting,
perhaps we can plead our case.

34:06.669 --> 34:08.755
Jet's waiting on the runway.

34:10.173 --> 34:11.632
[gunshot, then body thuds]

34:12.383 --> 34:13.718
Marvin, you coming?

34:17.930 --> 34:20.141
Hi, hon. I know it's late.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.894
I'll be here a while. They need me.

34:23.561 --> 34:27.106
I am watching a wedding video
of two people that are dead.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.983
Hey, you asked.

34:29.984 --> 34:31.694
Okay, I'll text when--

34:34.197 --> 34:35.448
Hon, I gotta go.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.201
One of the videos was the Lacroix wedding.

34:38.284 --> 34:41.370
Exactly as it was labeled.
Nothing to see there.

34:41.454 --> 34:43.122
Except I watched it anyway.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.708
You're right, it's not a thrill,

34:45.792 --> 34:48.127
but damn it if desk work
isn't gonna save your life.

34:48.211 --> 34:50.463
[woman] <i>That's enough</i>
<i>embarrassing stories.</i>

34:50.546 --> 34:54.550
<i>And now, someone who's very special</i>
<i>to both Tyson and Michelle.</i>

34:54.634 --> 34:57.637
<i>A lifelong friend and Tyson's best man.</i>

34:58.471 --> 35:02.767
[Marvin] <i>To Michelle and Tyson,</i>
<i>I love you guys so much.</i>

35:03.559 --> 35:06.771
<i>May I only find my own Michelle one day.</i>

35:07.688 --> 35:09.107
<i>To Michelle and Tyson.</i>

35:09.690 --> 35:12.527
<i>May their marriage be blessed forever.</i>

35:12.610 --> 35:13.861
<i>Cheers.</i>

35:17.657 --> 35:20.076
-[cell phone ringing]
-So it's 8:00 a.m. in Latvia.

35:20.159 --> 35:22.286
We have 10 hours of flying time--

35:22.370 --> 35:23.454
Hold that thought.

35:25.623 --> 35:26.999
-Harold.
-Where are you?

35:27.083 --> 35:29.752
I'm on the plane. A red-eye to Riga.

35:29.836 --> 35:31.587
Marvin's here too.

35:31.671 --> 35:35.216
Reddington, listen to me.
You cannot trust Marvin Gerard.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.051
Come again?

35:37.135 --> 35:41.055
Lacroix and Marvin were old friends.
Known each other for decades.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.766
<i>I can't connect all the dots,</i>
<i>but something is very wrong.</i>

35:43.850 --> 35:45.726
Harold, I appreciate the call.

35:47.728 --> 35:50.439
What is Edward doing?
Are we going to take off soon?

35:50.523 --> 35:55.736
He's probably flipping switches,
checking gauges, plotting our course.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.000
What--? What's going on?

36:10.418 --> 36:13.171
What is this? I don't understand.

36:13.254 --> 36:20.052
I'm sure Heddie is as interested as I am
to hear how and why you did what you did.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.971
So I'm gonna have a drink.

36:22.722 --> 36:23.931
-I'll pour.
-Hmm.

36:27.310 --> 36:30.563
And I hope your story is good.
Your life depends on it.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.863
["Child In Time" playing]

36:44.285 --> 36:48.164
[Marvin] <i>I am the most loyal to you</i>
<i>and always have been.</i>

36:48.247 --> 36:51.375
<i>But I never swore an oath</i>
<i>to Elizabeth Keen.</i>

36:52.335 --> 36:54.545
I never made it a secret
that I didn't trust her.

36:55.129 --> 36:58.132
She was unworthy and unqualified.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.301
To have her run things?

37:00.927 --> 37:02.470
Over my dead body.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.889
Careful what you wish for, Marvin.

37:09.268 --> 37:13.689
Everything I did, I did
in the best interests of your empire.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.567
After Elizabeth's death,
when you took off,

37:16.651 --> 37:18.611
I kept things going as best I could.

37:18.694 --> 37:20.947
And I did a pretty damn good job.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.534
When you came back,
I thought you'd finally be over it.

37:26.410 --> 37:30.164
You've lived your life
with so much death and loss.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.916
You've always gotten over it.

37:31.999 --> 37:36.420
But you were utterly determined to get
to the bottom of how she died.

37:37.004 --> 37:39.006
And I couldn't let that happen.

37:39.090 --> 37:42.760
I've tried everything I could
to slow you down, to stop you.

37:42.843 --> 37:44.387
I went after your money.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.307
I had my own friends killed.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.768
I went after Harold.

37:52.603 --> 37:53.688
Nothing worked.

37:54.647 --> 37:55.940
You just kept coming.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.692
So then, you went after me.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.735
Serving you up, Heddie,

38:00.319 --> 38:03.364
was a last resort to protect
my life with Raymond.

38:04.365 --> 38:05.908
That's all I am anymore.

38:08.577 --> 38:11.747
That's my life. Raymond Reddington.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.416
What a waste.

38:13.499 --> 38:15.668
What a terrible, terrible waste.

38:19.338 --> 38:21.007
How did you figure it out?

38:21.882 --> 38:22.717
I didn't.

38:25.177 --> 38:27.430
I've gone over it and over it.

38:27.513 --> 38:30.099
Thought of it and thought of it.

38:30.182 --> 38:34.645
I remember the day Elizabeth died
better than entire years of my life.

38:34.729 --> 38:38.774
I remember what she wore.
The smell of rain in the air.

38:40.192 --> 38:43.696
The sound of her voice.
The last words she spoke.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.490
The look in her eyes in that moment.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.367
That last moment.

38:48.451 --> 38:51.454
When she looked at me,
as if for the first time,

38:52.163 --> 38:54.332
seeing me for who I really was.

38:58.044 --> 38:59.920
But I'd forgotten about the headache.

39:01.672 --> 39:06.635
Until today, when Agent Park
was in front of me with her headache.

39:07.553 --> 39:09.180
And a glass shattered.

39:10.348 --> 39:14.060
All the time I spent agonizing

39:14.143 --> 39:17.396
over that GPS tracker
that Elizabeth ingested,

39:17.480 --> 39:18.814
where it came from...

39:21.567 --> 39:23.694
But I'd forgotten
about Elizabeth's headache.

39:25.321 --> 39:26.864
The morning of her death,

39:27.490 --> 39:32.036
we stopped by your office to sign
some paperwork, transfer some holdings.

39:33.662 --> 39:36.916
We had tea. She had coffee.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.210
What was in it?

39:40.127 --> 39:41.337
<i>She got a headache.</i>

39:42.505 --> 39:43.881
<i>You gave her aspirin.</i>

39:46.717 --> 39:48.469
<i>That's how you bugged her.</i>

39:52.556 --> 39:54.475
You did it right in front of me.

39:58.562 --> 40:04.110
Why this ruse with Heddie
at the warehouse, the gunshot?

40:04.193 --> 40:06.195
[Heddie] I can answer that.

40:06.278 --> 40:08.572
Raymond wanted to make you feel safe.

40:09.865 --> 40:12.159
Feel safe for what?

40:12.243 --> 40:15.704
To get you on the plane.
It'll be a nice long flight.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.374
Gives us time
to clear your offices and apartment,

40:18.457 --> 40:19.583
the place at the beach.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.878
Enough time to sift through everything...

40:24.296 --> 40:26.215
and decide what to do with you.

40:26.298 --> 40:27.466
[cell phone ringing]

40:31.804 --> 40:33.097
Don't you need to get that?

40:34.765 --> 40:36.142
Actually, it's for you.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.520
Excuse me?

40:40.020 --> 40:41.981
When I drove to the warehouse...

40:42.731 --> 40:47.695
I didn't know if I was in the clear yet,
so I put a small insurance plan in place.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.198
Just in case.

41:00.082 --> 41:04.336
I sent a panic alert
with this watch five minutes ago.

41:05.588 --> 41:09.133
If my shooter doesn't hear from me
in the next two minutes,

41:10.009 --> 41:14.221
he'll splatter her lovely mind
all over that trailer.

41:17.308 --> 41:21.395
I'm walking off this plane,

41:21.479 --> 41:25.858
and you are going to let me--

41:26.525 --> 41:29.236
Weecha. Weecha, he'll kill her.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.030
Stop it. Stop.

41:35.576 --> 41:38.454
I never wanted any of this.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.044
You've got an odd way of showing it.

41:45.628 --> 41:46.670
Wow.

41:47.713 --> 41:51.425
You. You are the one
who showed me the way.

41:51.509 --> 41:56.013
Those recordings you left for Elizabeth,
telling her how to run things.

41:57.806 --> 42:02.520
I ran them while you were gone,
I've run them since you've been back.

42:05.231 --> 42:08.442
May the best man win, old friend.

42:09.318 --> 42:12.071
-Good luck, Claudius.
-[Weecha groans]

42:12.154 --> 42:14.281
-Raymond, help! Breathe.
-Weecha.

42:14.865 --> 42:18.035
Weecha. Weecha. Weecha.

42:18.118 --> 42:19.119
Weecha!

42:21.372 --> 42:22.873
