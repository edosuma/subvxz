always assumed that one day,

08:07.358 --> 08:08.917
I'd take over the factory,
but I never said I would.

08:08.918 --> 08:10.375
Excuse me, sir, if you could just,

08:10.376 --> 08:11.386

- Huh?

08:11.387 --> 08:12.674

08:47.273 --> 08:49.631
Wow, that wanker's got a way with words.

08:49.632 --> 08:51.159
Mr. Price, come quick!

08:51.160 --> 08:53.810
Chambers' have sent back
their entire shoe order!

08:53.811 --> 08:54.901
After you, Mr. Price.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.530
Can someone sign so I can
get the rest of these shoes

08:57.531 --> 08:58.669
off me truck?

08:58.670 --> 08:59.991
Is there something wrong with them?

08:59.992 --> 09:01.140
Ask someone who cares.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.290
Sign all three copies.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.520
All right, Pat, I guess we should put

09:03.521 --> 09:05.128
these in the store room.

09:05.129 --> 09:07.499
The Chambers' winter shoe
order is already in there.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.333
What are these?

09:08.334 --> 09:10.059
The Chambers' spring shoe order.

09:10.060 --> 09:11.248
And we're currently manufacturing?

09:11.249 --> 09:13.982
The Chambers' summer shoe
order, and it's a big one.

09:13.983 --> 09:15.521
You telling me we have
a year's worth of shoes

09:15.522 --> 09:16.582
and no one to buy them?

09:16.583 --> 09:17.842
It started some time back.

09:17.843 --> 09:20.603
Chambers cut down orders,
but cutting back production

09:20.604 --> 09:22.106
would have meant cutting
back workers' hours,

09:22.107 --> 09:23.546
and your father wouldn't hear of it.

09:23.547 --> 09:24.827
I would have thought he'd told you,

09:24.828 --> 09:27.298
but then you were busy at
university and with your girl.

09:27.299 --> 09:28.928
Yeah, but what's to be
done with all these shoes?

09:28.929 --> 09:30.670
Once or twice, your
father sold overstock

09:30.671 --> 09:31.610
to the discount chains.

09:31.611 --> 09:32.640
So it's happened before?

09:32.641 --> 09:33.651
Never as bad as this.

09:33.652 --> 09:35.371
Actually, of late, he
seemed less concerned.

09:35.372 --> 09:37.725
He said he'd settled on some sort of plan!

09:37.726 --> 09:39.745
Sort of plan?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.445

10:05.821 --> 10:08.053

10:08.054 --> 10:09.141
He was a gent.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.104
And to yours.

10:13.385 --> 10:14.494
Ooh!

10:14.495 --> 10:16.676
Well, mate, I assume you didn't
come all the way to London

10:16.677 --> 10:17.686
just to buy me a drink.

10:17.687 --> 10:19.899
Yeah, seems like we find
ourselves with 600 pairs

10:19.900 --> 10:21.380
of brogues and no buyer.

10:21.381 --> 10:23.221
Chambers finally canceled
your orders completely,

10:23.222 --> 10:24.055
yeah, I heard.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.220
But then I remembered
the time your father

10:25.221 --> 10:28.304
found his stock short, and
my dad, at no small expense,

10:28.305 --> 10:30.344
took on the task of filling the shortfall.

10:30.345 --> 10:32.245
No fair conjuring ancient history.

10:32.246 --> 10:33.546
Look, I'll give 'em to you at cost.

10:33.547 --> 10:35.497
Cost, Harry, for old time's sake.

10:35.498 --> 10:37.467
You see these, Charlie?

10:37.468 --> 10:39.289
I import them from Slovakia and sell them

10:39.290 --> 10:41.661
at a fraction of your cost.

10:41.662 --> 10:43.663
But they're shite.

10:44.496 --> 10:46.622
A Price shoe will last a man a lifetime.

10:46.623 --> 10:49.224
The poor sod who buys these
will need new ones in a season.

10:49.225 --> 10:50.516
And I'll be right
there to sell him a pair

10:50.517 --> 10:51.986
at a very affordable price.

10:51.987 --> 10:55.046
Oi, ever hear the saying
poor people stay poor

10:55.047 --> 10:57.109
because they buy cheap shoes?

10:57.110 --> 10:58.829
You ever hear the saying
no matter how far down

10:58.830 --> 11:01.289
the wrong road you've gone, turn back?

11:01.290 --> 11:04.311
Selling off inventory's only
gonna prolong the inevitable.

11:04.312 --> 11:07.344
But tell me, Charlie,
is manufacturing shoes

23:00.423 --> 23:02.423
Not ones anyone wants.

23:03.354 --> 23:05.401
Over at the Whitcomb
factory, they noted a lack

23:05.402 --> 23:08.434
of all-weather hiking shoes, so?

23:09.741 --> 23:11.822
They started making
all-weather hiking shoes

23:11.823 --> 23:13.513
and saved the factory.

23:13.514 --> 23:16.481
Toby's has started making sandals.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.761
All the sods who survived went out looking

23:18.762 --> 23:22.911
for an underserved niche market
and aimed to fill the void.

23:22.912 --> 23:25.240
They didn't sit up in
their offices whining,

23:25.241 --> 23:27.461
"What else can I do?"

23:31.793 --> 23:33.640
Well, my wedding shoes are still here,

23:33.641 --> 23:35.821
but my fiance's nowhere in sight.

23:35.822 --> 23:38.330
Sorry, Nic, I'm completely underwater.

23:38.331 --> 23:40.010
You're saying you still haven't left?

23:40.011 --> 23:41.881
Charlie, we have an appointment.

23:41.882 --> 23:43.619
If we lose this hall, we'll
wind up gettin' married

23:43.620 --> 23:44.931
in a fish and chip shop.

23:44.932 --> 23:46.999
Yeah, now that sounds like fun!

23:47.000 --> 23:49.088
Are you seriously standing me up?

23:49.089 --> 23:51.549
Come on, Nic, do we
really need a showy wedding?

23:51.550 --> 23:53.377
In the end, shouldn't it be about us?

23:53.378 --> 23:55.418
A wedding announces
to the world who you,

23:55.419 --> 23:56.848
as a couple, are going to be.

23:56.849 --> 23:58.738
I've just given two-week
notices to George,

23:58.739 --> 24:00.027
Don, Maggie, Trish...

24:00.028 --> 24:00.950
Oh, bloody hell!

24:00.951 --> 24:03.128
I forgot to ask Maggie to be a bridesmaid.

24:03.129 --> 24:04.155
She'd like that, wouldn't she?

24:04.156 --> 24:05.978
I think she'd like getting paid better.

24:05.979 --> 24:07.858
Honestly, Nic, wouldn't
saving all those people's jobs

24:07.859 --> 24:10.198
tell the world a little bit more about us

24:10.199 --> 24:13.177
than having a fancy party
in a pair of 900-quid shoes

24:13.178 --> 24:14.657
you're only gonna wear once?

24:14.658 --> 24:16.768
Talk about your niche market.

24:19.197 --> 24:22.119
Talk about your niche market.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.260
Talk about what niche market?

24:24.261 --> 24:25.839
Take what you've got,
change the product,

24:25.840 --> 24:28.279
find an underserved nice
market, and they certainly are

24:28.280 --> 24:30.708
a completely underserved niche market!

24:30.709 --> 24:32.218
Have you gone off your nut?

24:32.219 --> 24:34.780
Nic, I'll ring you back.

24:34.781 --> 24:35.939
Lauren to the office.

24:35.940 --> 24:39.272
Come see Mr. Pri, Charlie in his office,

24:40.399 --> 24:41.838

25:00.940 --> 25:02.797
Yes!

25:02.798 --> 25:03.631
Yeah!

25:03.631 --> 25:04.577
Oh!

25:04.578 --> 25:07.936
You've returned.

25:07.937 --> 25:10.357
You've got a dark horse in
this boyfriend of yours.

25:10.358 --> 25:11.437
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

25:11.438 --> 25:12.576
- Nothing's going on here!
- She's not my...

25:12.577 --> 25:14.037
He's got another girl.

25:14.038 --> 25:15.718
I just stuff his boxes.

25:17.558 --> 25:20.225
At least for the next two weeks.

25:28.685 --> 25:30.194
What are you staring at?

25:30.195 --> 25:31.735
Oh, you'll have to forgive him.

25:31.736 --> 25:33.664
We don't get many
transvestites in Northampton.

25:33.665 --> 25:35.084
Ha, don't kid yourself.

25:35.085 --> 25:36.444
You're never more than 10 steps away

25:36.445 --> 25:38.303
from some sort of cross-dresser.

25:38.304 --> 25:41.883
In any case, those are not transvestites.

25:41.884 --> 25:43.134
They're drag queens.

25:43.135 --> 25:44.533
- There's a difference?
- Yes!

25:44.534 --> 25:47.693
A drag queen puts on a frock,
and suddenly, she's Cleopatra!

25:47.694 --> 25:50.271
A transvestite gets done
up and, often as not,

25:50.272 --> 25:52.584
looks like Winston Churchill
in his mother's knickers.

25:54.911 --> 25:55.744
And so you are...

25:55.745 --> 25:58.070
Insulted that you need to ask!

26:03.930 --> 26:06.939
So you fired this lovely girl?

26:06.940 --> 26:08.579
Things aren't very good in men's shoes.

26:08.580 --> 26:09.517
Certainly I'm not.

26:12.077 --> 26:13.026
How much do you weigh?

26:13.027 --> 26:14.335
Exactly the right amount.

26:14.336 --> 26:16.134
For a man, but you're
wearing women's boots.

26:16.135 --> 26:17.685
And I thought you
weren't paying attention.

26:17.686 --> 26:18.519
Well, it's all wrong.

26:18.519 --> 26:19.414
Hasn't stopped me yet.

26:19.415 --> 26:21.792
A heel made for a woman
cannot possibly support

26:21.793 --> 26:22.972
a man's weight.

26:22.973 --> 26:24.072
You need something special.

26:24.073 --> 26:27.280
And I deserve something special.

26:27.281 --> 26:30.621
Yes, well, if you trans-vet-erans

26:30.622 --> 26:32.149
are everywhere like you say,

26:32.150 --> 26:34.198
then there must be a niche market

26:34.199 --> 26:35.929
for properly built-to-last women's boots

26:35.930 --> 26:37.762
for women who are men.

26:38.819 --> 26:40.138
Yes?

26:40.139 --> 26:41.328
No?

26:41.329 --> 26:43.746
The international shoe exhibition
is in Milan next month.

26:43.747 --> 26:45.587
If we had something new to show,

26:45.588 --> 26:47.299
something no one else in
the world has to offer,

26:47.300 --> 26:48.995
it might just save the factory.

26:48.996 --> 26:49.969
Oh!

26:49.970 --> 26:51.037
I'd like to measure you up,

26:51.038 --> 26:52.925
go back and make a sample pair.

26:52.926 --> 26:54.065
First riddle me this.

26:54.066 --> 26:55.185
Who gets to keep the boots?

26:55.186 --> 26:56.356
And I'll give you a hint.

26:56.357 --> 26:58.864
The correct answer is you do, Lola.

26:58.865 --> 26:59.795
You do, Lola.

26:59.796 --> 27:02.023
Ah, and where do I pick them up?

27:02.024 --> 27:03.213
Price's of Northampton, is it?

27:03.214 --> 27:04.885
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, I'll bring them to you.

27:04.886 --> 27:06.289
I come to London all the time.

27:06.290 --> 27:08.441
You don't want me to come
to Northampton, do you?

27:08.442 --> 27:10.812
No.

27:11.645 --> 27:13.731
I'm sorry, but I have a terrible habit

27:13.732 --> 27:16.311
of doing exactly the
opposite of what people ask,

27:16.312 --> 27:19.289
which might explain why I'm
wearing this frock today.

27:19.290 --> 27:21.369
See you in Northampton.

27:21.370 --> 27:22.786

Burgundy?

32:24.277 --> 32:25.407
Is something wrong?

32:25.408 --> 32:30.325
Please, Lord, tell me
I've not inspired something

32:30.326 --> 32:31.415
burgundy!

32:34.325 --> 32:35.504
At the club, you said...

32:35.505 --> 32:36.784
- Red.
- You didn't specify...

32:36.785 --> 32:37.617
Red!

32:39.605 --> 32:40.764
Burgundy is a red!

32:40.765 --> 32:43.411
Burgundy's the color
of hot water bottles.

32:43.412 --> 32:45.411
Red is the color of sex.

32:47.272 --> 32:49.550
Burgundy's for cardigans and golF apparel.

32:49.551 --> 32:54.467
Red is passion and danger, and
signs that say do not enter!

33:00.661 --> 33:02.678
I've always been partial to pink.

33:02.679 --> 33:04.809
Pink is for playthings,
yellow for warnings,

33:04.810 --> 33:07.877
purple for princes, black is for wannabes.

33:07.878 --> 33:09.627
Green is for pickles,

33:10.755 --> 33:11.588
but red

33:13.435 --> 33:14.267
is for

33:16.045 --> 33:16.878
sex.

33:25.062 --> 33:26.462
Well, at least try them on.

33:26.463 --> 33:27.691
I guarantee they're comfy!

33:27.692 --> 33:29.161
Sex shouldn't be comfy.

33:29.162 --> 33:31.909
Oh, good, I thought it was just me!

33:33.142 --> 33:35.999
Comfy's what's been
putting you out of business.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.115
You want to save this place?

33:37.116 --> 33:37.950
Yeah.

33:37.951 --> 33:41.868
Then you're going to have
to start manufacturing sex,

33:41.869 --> 33:44.787
two-and-a-half-feet of irresistible

33:45.901 --> 33:46.734
tubular

33:48.153 --> 33:48.986
sex.

33:52.314 --> 33:53.732
But at least look at the heel.

33:53.733 --> 33:55.954
You sort can dance all night
and beat up a football team,

33:55.955 --> 33:57.813
but this heel will still be whole.

33:57.814 --> 33:58.784
Isn't that what you wanted?

33:58.785 --> 34:01.712
Not if it means looking
like a Ukrainian folk dancer.

34:01.713 --> 34:03.053
Ladies!

34:03.054 --> 34:05.614
Would you go out in something like this?

34:05.615 --> 34:07.455
No!

34:07.456 --> 34:10.535
But I say you'd look all right in 'em,

34:10.536 --> 34:12.188
sweetheart.

34:18.950 --> 34:20.868
And what's your name,

34:22.351 --> 34:23.185
darling?

34:24.360 --> 34:26.861
It's Don to you, sweetheart.

34:27.764 --> 34:30.515
Well,

34:31.845 --> 34:32.678
Don,

34:45.347 --> 34:48.217
if you can't get women to wear them,

34:48.218 --> 34:51.469
you'll never get 'em on blokes like me.

34:57.951 --> 35:01.301
And that's the color red you need!

35:01.302 --> 35:03.969
And Charlie, if you want

I'll ring back.

41:23.341 --> 41:24.418
Me?

41:24.419 --> 41:25.818
Stay?

41:25.819 --> 41:26.771
Here?

41:26.771 --> 41:27.651
Yes?

41:27.652 --> 41:29.103
No!

41:30.023 --> 41:32.922
Charlie, my boy, I abandoned
the provinces years ago,

41:32.923 --> 41:35.424
and your fellow Don in there
was a stellar reminder why.

41:35.425 --> 41:36.704
Forget about Don, he's just...

41:36.705 --> 41:39.484
Just like every other
man in Northampton.

41:39.485 --> 41:42.277
Charlie,

41:42.278 --> 41:44.066
I've lived this life once,
I'm not doing it again.

41:44.067 --> 41:45.623
Oh, so you head back
to London and I'm here,

41:45.624 --> 41:47.606
trying to save a factory
that four generations

41:47.607 --> 41:50.476
of my family poured
their life's blood into?

41:50.477 --> 41:52.160
Get to the part that applies to me.

41:53.268 --> 41:55.258
I'm willing to gamble the
fate of this whole enterprise

41:55.259 --> 41:57.489
on you as a designer.

41:57.490 --> 41:59.249
Me, a designer?

41:59.250 --> 42:00.591
Now who's kidding who?

42:00.592 --> 42:02.180
Hand me glitter, feathers,
and a hot glue gun,

42:02.181 --> 42:04.521
and I can make the world a pretty place.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.643
But me, a designer?

42:05.644 --> 42:07.472
I've been force-fed
shoes since childhood,

42:07.473 --> 42:09.222
but I never seen nothing
like what you just drew.

42:09.223 --> 42:10.554
They're drawings,

42:10.555 --> 42:12.573
the silly scribblings
of a braggarty sissy boy

42:12.574 --> 42:15.134
who doesn't know when to shut his gob.

42:15.135 --> 42:18.670
Oh, have a gander at me, Charlie.

42:18.671 --> 42:21.147
I wouldn't trust me to babysit a cactus.

42:23.013 --> 42:26.349
You are passionate about shoes.

42:26.350 --> 42:30.551
I haven't heard anyone talk
about a heel that way since,

42:30.552 --> 42:34.879
well, not since my father.

42:36.686 --> 42:39.640
You know how rare it is to
feel that way about something?

42:39.641 --> 42:41.369
You know how jealous I am?

42:41.370 --> 42:44.056
I never been passionate about nothin'.

42:44.057 --> 42:45.574
Well, maybe snoggin'.

42:45.575 --> 42:48.330
Ah, but you're forgetting something.

42:48.331 --> 42:49.767
I don't know how to make a shoe.

42:49.768 --> 42:51.622
It just so happens I do!

42:51.623 --> 42:53.431
If we're to succeed, we'll
need to produce a boot

42:53.432 --> 42:55.337
unlike anything anyone
has ever seen before.

42:55.338 --> 42:56.904
That's where you come in.

42:56.905 --> 42:58.452
And if we don't want to
be laughed out of Milan,

42:58.453 --> 43:00.416
they'll have to be executed so impeccably

43:00.417 --> 43:02.596
that no one can deny we're
comers to be reckoned with,

43:02.597 --> 43:06.092
and that, God help us, is where I come in.

43:07.440 --> 43:09.128
Three weeks.

43:09.129 --> 43:12.481
Three weeks, Lola, that's all I'm asking.

43:12.482 --> 43:14.040
Is that a taxi or a police car?

43:14.041 --> 43:16.066
Guess I'll find out
when I offer him money.

43:16.067 --> 43:18.394
Opportunity has fallen into your lap!

43:18.395 --> 43:19.957
The easy thing, maybe
even the sensible thing

43:19.958 --> 43:21.935
would be to walk off and have a laugh

43:21.936 --> 43:24.290
about the time some
nutter offered you a job

43:24.291 --> 43:26.121
designing kinky boots.

43:29.046 --> 43:31.241
But I promise, if you do,
the rest of your life,

43:31.242 --> 43:34.154
you'll wonder what if I'd said yes?

43:35.634 --> 43:37.215
What if I'd stayed?

43:44.403 --> 43:47.565
A designer?

43:50.149 --> 43:51.065
A designer!

43:54.495 --> 43:58.543
I guess I could get used
to the name Kinky Boots.

44:00.607 --> 44:01.772
Or better yet,

44:02.856 --> 44:05.230

51:50.623 --> 51:53.797
I'm afraid all we've got is men's

51:53.798 --> 51:54.786

51:58.231 --> 52:00.411
Charlie, quick!

52:00.412 --> 52:02.652
Lola's gone and locked
herself in the loo, hurry.

52:02.653 --> 52:03.834
All right, I'll talk to her,

52:03.835 --> 52:05.054
but I'm not going into the ladies' room.

52:05.055 --> 52:06.335
You go and get her to come out.

52:06.336 --> 52:07.376

Lola, it's Charlie, are you sick?

Depends who you ask.

52:33.836 --> 52:34.669
No!

52:35.906 --> 52:37.199
Did someone nick your frock?

52:38.499 --> 52:39.699
I come up with the daft idea

52:39.700 --> 52:42.535
that maybe I should try to fit in.

52:43.403 --> 52:46.605
Probably get a lot
more work done this way.

52:46.606 --> 52:48.739
Less bits and bobs to
catch in the machines.

52:49.937 --> 52:51.727
Thanks for your support.

52:51.728 --> 52:53.382
God!

52:53.383 --> 52:56.865
In a gown, I can bellow
Brunhilde in front of 500 drunks

52:56.866 --> 52:59.845
and have a laugh, but
put me in men's clothes

52:59.846 --> 53:03.128
and I can't sodding well say hello.

53:03.129 --> 53:04.740
Oh, what am I doing here, Charlie?

53:04.741 --> 53:05.930
Becoming a designer.

53:05.931 --> 53:08.303
Did I ever ask to be one?

53:08.304 --> 53:11.414
Well, did you always
want to be a performer?

53:11.415 --> 53:14.445
I mean, when you were a kid.

53:14.446 --> 53:16.830
Whatever it was I wanted as a kid,

53:16.831 --> 53:19.662
my father beat out of me.

53:19.663 --> 53:20.941
Your dad hit you?

53:20.942 --> 53:22.714
Not like that.

53:22.715 --> 53:24.356
He was a boxer.

53:24.357 --> 53:26.548
Yeah, a proper prize fighter

53:26.549 --> 53:28.779
who never got the title match he wanted.

53:28.780 --> 53:30.820
But presented with a baby boy?

53:30.821 --> 53:34.263
Well, if he couldn't raise a
champion's belt over his head,

53:34.264 --> 53:35.283
his son would.

53:35.284 --> 53:36.178
He didn't know about...

53:36.179 --> 53:37.426
Of course he knew.

53:37.427 --> 53:41.188
But he figured if he pushed
me, trained me himself,

53:41.189 --> 53:43.580
ah, you heard right.

53:43.581 --> 53:45.831
I am a professionally-trained boxer

53:45.832 --> 53:48.927
with a dozen amateur bouts
to my name, so don't try me!

53:51.337 --> 53:56.005
But when I appeared for a fight
in a white cocktail dress,

53:58.710 --> 53:59.959
he disowned me.

54:01.121 --> 54:02.620
Refused to see me,

54:04.636 --> 54:07.967
even when he came down with lung cancer.

54:09.283 --> 54:11.381
It's ironic, really.

54:11.382 --> 54:13.679
Fags got him in the end.

54:21.413 --> 54:22.245
And you?

54:23.322 --> 54:24.910
You like making shoes?

54:27.537 --> 54:30.195
On the day I was born, my
dad set me down next in line

54:30.196 --> 54:31.445
of Price & Son.

54:33.843 --> 54:36.591
For him, a done deal, but for me?

54:37.732 --> 54:40.739
First opportunity, I grabbed
my childhood sweetheart

54:40.740 --> 54:43.576
and we jumped on the
next train out of town.

54:43.577 --> 54:46.401
What was it you ran off to do?

54:46.402 --> 54:49.562
Anything but what he wanted.

It's not what you change about a building,

1:01:50.611 --> 1:01:53.991
it's what you preserve that
marks a great conversion.

1:01:53.992 --> 1:01:56.189

1:02:57.954 --> 1:02:59.035
That was...

1:03:00.988 --> 1:03:02.016
You have to get to know him.

1:03:02.017 --> 1:03:03.455
Listen, Nic, I haven't
gone into this lightly.

1:03:03.456 --> 1:03:04.904
There actually is a market out there...

1:03:04.905 --> 1:03:06.701
Before you make a
complete fool of yourself,

1:03:06.702 --> 1:03:08.738
it's time you heard the truth.

1:03:08.739 --> 1:03:10.563
Selling the building
was your father's idea.

1:03:10.564 --> 1:03:11.693
- Oh!
- Yes!

1:03:11.694 --> 1:03:13.119
Your father's idea.

1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:14.869
He approached Richard months ago.

1:03:14.870 --> 1:03:15.702
Tell him.

1:03:15.703 --> 1:03:18.423
It's true, your dad and
I had several meetings.

1:03:18.424 --> 1:03:21.259
You yourself told me that
he had a plan, remember?

1:03:21.260 --> 1:03:22.757
Well, this was it.

1:03:23.864 --> 1:03:26.388
The contracts were almost
done when he passed away.

1:03:26.389 --> 1:03:28.912
We can show you the papers.

1:03:28.913 --> 1:03:31.829
Look, Richard came to
me first lest you think

1:03:31.830 --> 1:03:34.215
your father doubted you
could run the business.

1:03:34.216 --> 1:03:35.972
But don't look so down.

1:03:35.973 --> 1:03:37.769
This is all good news!

1:03:37.770 --> 1:03:40.455
The deal Richard's put together
will rid you of the factory,

1:03:40.456 --> 1:03:43.062
settle your family's debts,
and ensure our future

1:03:43.063 --> 1:03:46.058
with a career-defining
selling opportunity!

1:03:46.059 --> 1:03:48.406
We even get a model flat
rent-free while we're selling.

1:03:48.407 --> 1:03:50.099
I'm asking you to
have a bit of faith in...

1:03:50.100 --> 1:03:51.300
Stop!

1:03:51.301 --> 1:03:52.799
Are you deaf?

1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:56.401
Your father was cashing
out, you owe him nothing!

1:03:56.402 --> 1:03:57.940
The prison door's open.

1:03:57.941 --> 1:03:59.596
You're free, Charlie.

1:12:03.845 --> 1:12:05.202

1:23:49.370 --> 1:23:52.700
losing a fight is like

1:24:35.732 --> 1:24:36.565

everyone just stop talking!

1:25:03.203 --> 1:25:04.970
Now, one of you, please, cut to the chase.

1:25:04.971 --> 1:25:05.971
We miscalculated.

1:25:05.972 --> 1:25:08.141
The Milan trip is going to
cost more than we budgeted.

1:25:08.142 --> 1:25:10.071
No, it can't cost more
because we have no more.

1:25:10.072 --> 1:25:11.661
It's me, I'm the blunderer.

1:25:11.662 --> 1:25:13.890
I never factored in
land transport in Milan.

1:25:13.891 --> 1:25:15.061
Or the import taxes.

1:25:15.062 --> 1:25:16.601
No, I planned for the
taxes on the samples,

1:25:16.602 --> 1:25:17.670
but only one pair of each.

1:25:17.671 --> 1:25:18.581
I know, stupid.

1:25:18.581 --> 1:25:19.414

1:25:19.415 --> 1:25:21.538

1:25:21.539 --> 1:25:23.100

a bloody fashion show

1:25:23.101 --> 1:25:23.934

If we don't get our boots to Milan,

1:25:24.931 --> 1:25:26.401
then all this work will
have been for nothing!

1:25:26.402 --> 1:25:27.590
How about we call the bank?

1:25:27.591 --> 1:25:29.409
Maybe seeing how close
we are, they'd carry us.

1:25:29.410 --> 1:25:30.271
Good day, Mr. Banker.

1:25:30.272 --> 1:25:32.169
We've gone tits up making
the best shoes in England,

1:25:32.170 --> 1:25:34.430
but we've chucked all that to
make boots for trans-gentries.

1:25:34.431 --> 1:25:35.481
How'd you like to bunk in with us?

1:25:35.482 --> 1:25:37.537
It would be an awful burden, I know,

1:25:37.538 --> 1:25:39.790
but how about a short-term
mortgage on your new flat?

1:25:39.791 --> 1:25:40.624
I just did that!

1:25:40.624 --> 1:25:41.549
That's how we got to today.

1:25:41.550 --> 1:25:42.877
Charlie, Charlie!

1:25:42.878 --> 1:25:45.227
I was sitting on the loo when
I was truck by lightning.

1:25:45.228 --> 1:25:49.128
Oh, kitten, you ought to
close the window first!

1:25:49.129 --> 1:25:50.947
I spoke to a nice chap
down at the post office.

1:25:50.948 --> 1:25:52.779
Let me see if he can give
us any leeway on the taxes.

1:25:52.780 --> 1:25:54.066
Will someone listen to me?

1:25:54.067 --> 1:25:55.099
We're in crisis here!

1:25:55.100 --> 1:25:57.249
Charlie, you want me
to hire Italian models

1:25:57.250 --> 1:25:59.517
and hair and makeup staff, why?

1:25:59.518 --> 1:26:01.360
At last, one question
to which I have an answer.

1:26:01.361 --> 1:26:02.931
I want you to hire
models, hair, and makeup

1:26:02.932 --> 1:26:04.583
because we are putting on a show!

1:26:04.584 --> 1:26:06.104
But why are we using fashion models?

1:26:06.105 --> 1:26:07.073
Oh, I've got this one too.

1:26:07.074 --> 1:26:08.683
Because we are putting on a fashion show.

1:26:08.684 --> 1:26:10.802
But why are we using
professional fashion models?

1:26:10.803 --> 1:26:11.826
Oh, this really is my day.

1:26:11.827 --> 1:26:13.976
Because we are putting on a
professional fashion show!

1:26:13.977 --> 1:26:16.668
Let's take the girls from the club!

1:26:16.669 --> 1:26:17.503
The Angels?

1:26:17.504 --> 1:26:19.183
Who would be more
fun to see on a runway,

1:26:19.184 --> 1:26:21.693
a bunch of personality-free
pretty boys prancing about,

1:26:21.694 --> 1:26:25.264
or a gaggle of fabulous
drags who can demonstrate

1:26:25.265 --> 1:26:27.289
what these boots were born to do?

1:26:27.290 --> 1:26:28.529
You're not serious,
you want me to gamble

1:26:28.530 --> 1:26:31.659
my family's business,
this building, my home,

1:26:31.660 --> 1:26:33.479
the very shirt on my back
on a ramshackle bunch

1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:34.598
- of broken-down...
- There you go,

1:26:34.599 --> 1:26:36.021
biting the hand that feeds!

1:26:36.022 --> 1:26:37.120
I don't know which one is more daft,

1:26:37.121 --> 1:26:38.559
what you're saying or what you're wearing.

1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:42.111
Want to have a look at these, Mr. Price?

1:26:42.112 --> 1:26:44.544
No, no, the heel is wrong,
this isn't the design.

1:26:44.545 --> 1:26:45.895
True enough, but
up against the deadline,

1:26:45.896 --> 1:26:47.175
we had to improvise.

1:26:47.176 --> 1:26:48.386
Well, it's nothing like the drawing!

1:26:48.387 --> 1:26:49.798
We had to put the
heel on a different angle.

1:26:49.799 --> 1:26:51.067
Why?

1:26:51.068 --> 1:26:53.210
Else we'd have to create
an entirely new steel shank.

1:26:53.211 --> 1:26:54.348
Then do it!

1:26:54.349 --> 1:26:55.498
We'll have no sewing time

1:26:55.499 --> 1:26:56.739
if we have to wait for a new heel.

1:26:56.740 --> 1:26:58.412
I told them to go ahead like that.

1:26:58.413 --> 1:26:59.247
But it's not what you drew.

1:26:59.248 --> 1:27:00.590
One's a drawing, one's a shoe.

1:27:00.591 --> 1:27:01.524
I didn't give you approval!

1:27:01.525 --> 1:27:03.414
No, all you give me is deadlines.

1:27:03.415 --> 1:27:05.113
Okay, we're gonna do
this right or not at all.

1:27:05.114 --> 1:27:07.104
Let me see them?

1:27:07.105 --> 1:27:09.377
No, these seams aren't
straight, you're rushing.

1:27:09.378 --> 1:27:10.275
- Do it again.
- Excuse me?

1:27:10.276 --> 1:27:12.167
And the zipper is set wrong!

1:27:12.168 --> 1:27:14.419
People, this is for Milan,

1:27:14.420 --> 1:27:16.347
for the most sophisticated
shoe buyers in the world!

1:27:16.348 --> 1:27:17.181
So?

1:27:18.435 --> 1:27:21.120
So I don't want to be the
laughing stock of the industry!

1:27:21.121 --> 1:27:23.041
We're on thin ice puttin'
these out in the first place!

1:27:23.042 --> 1:27:25.402
Everyone, stop, oi, stop,
stop, hold on the floor!

1:27:25.403 --> 1:27:27.545
Marge, Maggie, George,

1:27:27.546 --> 1:27:29.706
George, Trish, take a look at these.

1:27:29.707 --> 1:27:32.755
Now, they all have to be picked
out and redone correctly.

1:27:32.756 --> 1:27:33.876
They all have to be done again.

1:27:33.877 --> 1:27:35.210
It's Saturday!

1:27:37.406 --> 1:27:38.239
And?

1:27:39.517 --> 1:27:42.279
I don't mind a bit of rah-rah-kumbaya

1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:44.418
for the sake of the team,

1:27:44.419 --> 1:27:47.091
but some of us have a
life outside this factory!

1:27:47.092 --> 1:27:51.761
And you'll have a bloody
lot more of it if I fire you.

1:27:53.383 --> 1:27:54.717
Now do it again,

1:27:55.944 --> 1:27:56.777
please.

1:27:59.877 --> 1:28:00.710
You have a problem?

1:28:00.711 --> 1:28:02.417
All right, everyone, back to work!

1:28:02.418 --> 1:28:03.281
Here's what I don't understand,

1:28:03.282 --> 1:28:05.657
why am I the only one who cares?

1:28:05.658 --> 1:28:06.658
No, not now, Nic!

1:28:06.659 --> 1:28:08.367
Don't even think about
puttin' me off, Charlie.

1:28:08.368 --> 1:28:10.830
Sorry, Nic, but I'm up
against a bit of a crisis here.

1:28:10.831 --> 1:28:14.170
You mortgaged our flat without
even discussin' it with me!

1:28:14.171 --> 1:28:16.380
There I am, havin' my
supper, alone as usual,

1:28:16.381 --> 1:28:17.972
and along comes a man
to measure up the garden

1:28:17.973 --> 1:28:18.932
for the valuation!

1:28:18.932 --> 1:28:19.765
Yeah, I can explain.

1:28:19.766 --> 1:28:22.302
No one can ever say I
didn't stand by my man,

1:28:22.303 --> 1:28:24.596
and I'll stand by you still
if you give me but one reason.

1:28:24.597 --> 1:28:26.106
The reason is right in front of you.

1:28:26.107 --> 1:28:28.365
Isn't saving Price & Son worth everything?

1:28:28.366 --> 1:28:30.045
Where was this passion
when I was trying to make us

1:28:30.046 --> 1:28:30.949
a new life in London?

1:28:30.950 --> 1:28:32.389
- London was for you.
- For us.

1:28:32.390 --> 1:28:36.631
For you, you wanted
London and I went along.

1:28:36.632 --> 1:28:37.465
Really?

1:28:38.782 --> 1:28:41.740
Well, you could have fooled me.

1:28:41.741 --> 1:28:43.204
And what about us?

1:28:43.205 --> 1:28:45.623
Was gettin' engaged just for me too?

1:28:45.624 --> 1:28:48.013
And this, who's this rubbish for?

1:28:48.014 --> 1:28:49.875
Oh, don't tell me it's for your father.

1:28:49.876 --> 1:28:51.425
He's probably spinning in his grave

1:28:51.426 --> 1:28:54.717
over what you've turned his factory into.

1:28:54.718 --> 1:28:56.456
So who's it for, Charlie?

1:28:56.457 --> 1:28:57.729
That fancy friend of yours?

1:28:57.730 --> 1:28:59.169
Doing special favors for him?

1:28:59.170 --> 1:29:00.520
Something going on there
I should know about?

1:29:00.521 --> 1:29:01.570
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

1:29:01.571 --> 1:29:03.583
Well, how should I know who
you've been sleeping with?

1:29:03.584 --> 1:29:04.418
Certainly hasn't been with me!

1:29:04.419 --> 1:29:05.707
- I'm doing it for them.
- Who?

1:29:05.708 --> 1:29:07.199
Them, our friends!

1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:08.033
No?

1:29:08.034 --> 1:29:10.000
We grew up with these people,
we've known them all our lives

1:29:10.001 --> 1:29:12.561
and now their whole livelihood
is riding on this factory!

1:29:12.562 --> 1:29:15.951
And this factory is riding
straight off the cliff!

1:29:15.952 --> 1:29:17.321
If your father was still here,

1:29:17.322 --> 1:29:18.483
they'd already be out of work.

1:29:18.484 --> 1:29:20.234
But he isn't, I am!

1:29:21.611 --> 1:29:23.523
So you're hankering to be a hero.

1:29:23.524 --> 1:29:24.357
Nic!

1:29:24.358 --> 1:29:27.533
Charlie to the rescue, is it?

1:29:27.534 --> 1:29:30.868
Well, how do I get Charlie to rescue me?

1:29:35.667 --> 1:29:38.085
You look nice, all done up.

1:29:41.069 --> 1:29:44.030
Richard's put me on a new project.

1:29:44.031 --> 1:29:45.487
- Big time stuff.
- Yeah.

1:29:45.488 --> 1:29:47.951
I'm headed back to London for good.

1:29:47.952 --> 1:29:49.203
Are you coming?

1:29:53.014 --> 1:29:55.682
Aren't those the shoes we saw?

1:29:58.117 --> 1:30:00.414
How long was I supposed to wait?

1:30:06.451 --> 1:30:08.161
- So long, Charlie.
- Yeah.

1:30:14.221 --> 1:30:15.860
If you're done making wedding plans,

1:30:15.861 --> 1:30:17.821
can we finish discussing the Milan show?

1:30:17.822 --> 1:30:18.915
There's no discussion to be had!

1:30:18.916 --> 1:30:21.050
We're using professional models, done!

1:30:21.051 --> 1:30:22.000
Then you better get on the phone

1:30:22.001 --> 1:30:24.518
because I just called and canceled them.

1:30:24.519 --> 1:30:25.700
I never told you that you could!

1:30:25.701 --> 1:30:26.671
Think, Charlie!

1:30:26.672 --> 1:30:28.009
My girls don't need to be paid.

1:30:28.010 --> 1:30:29.188
They'll do it for cocktails, giggles,

1:30:29.189 --> 1:30:31.075
and the chance to walk
a professional runway,

1:30:31.076 --> 1:30:33.808
and my girls do their own hair and makeup,

1:30:33.809 --> 1:30:35.730
so there's the money we
need to get us to Milan.

1:30:35.731 --> 1:30:36.836
How do I get this into your head?

1:30:36.837 --> 1:30:39.246
We are marketing to the world's
most sophisticated buyers...

1:30:39.247 --> 1:30:41.026
Half of whom probably
watch the evening news

1:30:41.027 --> 1:30:42.315
wearing their wives' brassieres.

1:30:42.316 --> 1:30:43.586
News flash for Lola!

1:30:43.587 --> 1:30:44.420
There are a whole lot of us

1:30:44.421 --> 1:30:45.805
who don't watch the
evening news in brassieres!

1:30:45.806 --> 1:30:47.386
Well, bully for you,
but you ain't my buyers.

1:30:47.387 --> 1:30:48.415
Then here's another news flash.

1:30:48.416 --> 1:30:49.984
I am not flying all the way across Europe

1:30:49.985 --> 1:30:51.391
just to sell to your chums.

1:30:51.392 --> 1:30:53.583
We won't be selling to anyone
if we can't get to Milan.

1:30:53.584 --> 1:30:55.390
Then there's no reason to
go if all we've got to show

1:30:55.391 --> 1:30:57.683
is a bunch of Nancy-boys
stomping about in skirts!

1:30:57.684 --> 1:31:00.869
We need to show these boots on women.

1:31:00.870 --> 1:31:01.723
- Women?
- You heard me.

1:31:01.723 --> 1:31:02.556
That was never the deal.

1:31:02.556 --> 1:31:03.388
Well, then the deal was wrong.

1:31:03.388 --> 1:31:04.263
What did that girl say to you?

1:31:04.264 --> 1:31:06.581
Look, I am not embarrasin'
the name of Price & Son

1:31:06.582 --> 1:31:07.959
by parading a planeload of misfits...

1:31:07.960 --> 1:31:08.949
- Misfits?
- At the most influential

1:31:08.950 --> 1:31:10.669
footwear show in the world.

1:31:10.670 --> 1:31:13.019
Listen to me, Lola, these
boots can be mainstream!

1:31:13.020 --> 1:31:15.060
Drag queens are mainstream!

1:31:15.061 --> 1:31:16.650
Just this morning, I was
offered a gig singing

1:31:16.651 --> 1:31:17.580
at a nursing home.

1:31:17.581 --> 1:31:19.118
A nursing home, Charlie, in Clacton.

1:31:19.119 --> 1:31:20.867
And maybe that's just where you belong!

1:31:20.868 --> 1:31:21.701
What?

1:31:21.702 --> 1:31:23.064
Look at you.

1:31:23.065 --> 1:31:24.184
You're meant to be a business person.

1:31:24.185 --> 1:31:26.256
How many successful designers
do you think go about

1:31:26.257 --> 1:31:28.775
camped up like the entertainment
at a low-rent tea dance?

1:31:28.776 --> 1:31:30.175
After all I've shared with you,

1:31:30.176 --> 1:31:31.181
you still think I'm wearing this

1:31:31.182 --> 1:31:32.523
for a lack of a pair of trousers?

1:31:32.524 --> 1:31:34.123
Look, I get it, I understand.

1:31:34.124 --> 1:31:36.261
All of this frou-frou, it
protects who you really are.

1:31:36.262 --> 1:31:37.552
- I heard you.
- You heard nothing!

1:31:37.553 --> 1:31:39.621
I'm telling you, you don't have to hide!

1:31:39.622 --> 1:31:40.893
Once the industry sees your work,

1:31:40.894 --> 1:31:43.372
you'll be able to stop all of
this and have a normal life!

1:31:43.373 --> 1:31:45.172
- You're a fool!
- Am I?

1:31:45.173 --> 1:31:47.680
I'd wager if we stood side
by side and asked passersby

1:31:47.681 --> 1:31:49.057
which one of us is fooling himself,

1:31:49.058 --> 1:31:51.069
most of the votes would swing your way!

1:31:51.070 --> 1:31:51.903
- Ha!
- Why am I

1:31:51.904 --> 1:31:53.778
the only one in here who believes in you?

1:31:53.779 --> 1:31:56.358
You believe in my
shoes, I am not my shoes!

1:31:56.359 --> 1:31:57.628
No, you're a joke!

1:31:57.629 --> 1:31:58.817
You think you're being
all mystical and deep

1:31:58.818 --> 1:32:00.536
representing the best of both sexes,

1:32:00.537 --> 1:32:03.717
but I'm here to tell you
that all you are is daft!

1:32:03.718 --> 1:32:05.146
You say you want to be treated like a man,

1:32:05.147 --> 1:32:07.397
then start acting like one!

1:32:08.427 --> 1:32:11.926
I'm sorry, but sometimes, the truth hurts!

1:32:16.385 --> 1:32:17.385
The truth?

1:32:19.724 --> 1:32:20.557
The truth?

1:32:23.394 --> 1:32:24.726
We're done here.

1:32:27.073 --> 1:32:28.073
And Simon!

1:32:29.811 --> 1:32:32.001
Yes, that's right, Simon,

1:32:32.002 --> 1:32:33.081
when you show up at the airport,

1:32:33.082 --> 1:32:37.769
try to look somethin'
like your passport photo.

1:32:37.770 --> 1:32:38.602
Yes?

1:32:40.510 --> 1:32:42.093
For both our sakes.

1:32:49.108 --> 1:32:49.941
Here.

1:32:53.057 --> 1:32:54.525
This is shite, do it again.

1:32:54.526 --> 1:32:55.696
You're outta your bloody mind!

1:32:55.697 --> 1:32:56.874
This is for Milan!

1:32:56.875 --> 1:32:58.404
Milan!

1:32:58.405 --> 1:33:01.351
Milan, you don't even know what Milan is.

1:33:01.352 --> 1:33:04.483
You've never been there,
you're just guessin'!

1:33:04.484 --> 1:33:05.324
And I'm goin' home!

1:33:05.325 --> 1:33:06.672
I don't have to
guess to know what's good.

1:33:06.673 --> 1:33:07.751
They'd be good enough for your father!

1:33:07.752 --> 1:33:10.002
Well, I am not my father!

1:33:11.224 --> 1:33:12.306
Truer words

1:33:13.709 --> 1:33:15.126
were never spoke.

1:33:18.441 --> 1:33:19.608
Do it again.

1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:25.866
As the saying goes, you
want something done your way,

1:33:25.867 --> 1:33:26.783
have at it!

1:33:28.878 --> 1:33:31.447
What say we clear out

1:33:31.448 --> 1:33:33.725
and leave the man from
Milan to his stitching!

1:33:33.726 --> 1:33:35.945
We have all these samples
to make, and no time.

1:33:35.946 --> 1:33:37.865
If you all go home now, what
have we been working for?

1:33:37.866 --> 1:33:39.033
Maggie, Marge.

1:33:40.226 --> 1:33:41.058

1:38:22.805 --> 1:38:24.546
Down, doggie.

1:38:25.826 --> 1:38:27.225
Like every mutt I've ever met,

1:38:27.226 --> 1:38:30.308
you only growl because you're scared.

1:38:31.215 --> 1:38:34.482
Dogs growl to protect something.

1:38:34.483 --> 1:38:37.149
I've nothing left to growl over.

1:38:38.532 --> 1:38:41.730
You're a funny one, Charlie Price.

1:38:41.731 --> 1:38:43.541
I always took you for a spoiled brat

1:38:43.542 --> 1:38:46.874
waitin' to have the world handed to him.

1:38:47.710 --> 1:38:52.126
Don't hand me nothin'
unless you want it destroyed.

1:38:56.979 --> 1:38:57.896
Budge up.

1:39:05.868 --> 1:39:08.535
Feelin' sorry for ourselves, eh?

1:39:12.139 --> 1:39:12.972
I...

1:39:15.978 --> 1:39:19.061
I felt the same way when my dad died.

1:39:21.758 --> 1:39:22.591
Yeah?

1:39:25.056 --> 1:39:25.889
Yeah.

1:39:28.316 --> 1:39:29.483
I was so lost.

1:39:32.055 --> 1:39:33.555
After the funeral,

1:39:35.035 --> 1:39:37.714
the undertaker handed me
a shoebox of his stuff

1:39:37.715 --> 1:39:40.381
and said, "That's what he left."

1:39:42.234 --> 1:39:45.066
And I looked at him and I said no,

1:39:46.222 --> 1:39:47.972
this is what he left.

1:39:51.731 --> 1:39:56.390
What a body leaves behind
ain't in his pocket.

1:39:56.391 --> 1:39:59.973
Sometimes, it's what
he inspired in others.

1:40:12.338 --> 1:40:14.334
Turn around, Charlie.

1:40:14.335 --> 1:40:15.605
What's going on?

1:40:15.606 --> 1:40:17.125
Why's the factory all lit up?

1:40:17.126 --> 1:40:19.292
Go and see for yourself.

1:40:20.405 --> 1:40:22.025
Hey.

1:40:22.026 --> 1:40:24.052
You did this?

1:40:24.053 --> 1:40:25.534
Me? No, no, no.

1:40:25.535 --> 1:40:26.951
Don, Don done it.

1:40:29.803 --> 1:40:32.239
Lola challenged him to accept
someone for who they are,

1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:34.110
and I'd say he rather
rose to the occasion.

1:40:34.111 --> 1:40:35.361
What, so Don got everyone back to work

1:40:35.362 --> 1:40:37.448
just by accepting Lola?

1:40:37.449 --> 1:40:38.616
No, Charlie.

1:40:40.137 --> 1:40:40.970
You.

1:40:42.757 --> 1:40:44.174
Don accepted you.

1:40:45.168 --> 1:40:46.001
Oi!

1:40:47.586 --> 1:40:50.885
I heard you was runnin' low on funds.

1:40:50.886 --> 1:40:52.636

1:40:57.984 --> 1:40:59.685

1:41:01.292 --> 1:41:02.352
Here we go, mates.

1:41:02.353 --> 1:41:05.422
Should we see what he thinks?

1:41:15.990 --> 1:41:17.019
Well?

1:41:17.020 --> 1:41:17.853
Wow!

1:41:19.488 --> 1:41:20.321
My God.

We got it all?

1:41:43.328 --> 1:41:44.743
Yeah, van should've been here by now.

1:41:44.744 --> 1:41:46.953
Maybe he's gone around to
the loading bay, I'll check.

1:41:46.954 --> 1:41:48.334
Lola's not here, she's not coming.

1:41:48.335 --> 1:41:49.168
Ring her again.

1:41:49.168 --> 1:41:50.135
I've rung a dozen times.

1:41:50.136 --> 1:41:51.872
I can't even get Pat to answer my calls.

1:41:51.873 --> 1:41:54.112
Maybe they're flying
straight from London.

1:41:54.113 --> 1:41:55.004
She wouldn't miss this.

1:41:55.005 --> 1:41:56.160
After what I said?

1:41:56.161 --> 1:41:57.438
Oh, here comes the van.

1:41:57.439 --> 1:42:00.771
I'll load the boots, you try Lola again.

1:42:09.761 --> 1:42:11.760
Hello, Lola.

1:42:11.761 --> 1:42:13.094
Guess who again.

1:42:14.101 --> 1:42:15.441
We're on our way to the airport,

1:42:15.442 --> 1:42:19.608
but there's a monumental
hole where you should be,

1:42:20.711 --> 1:42:22.461
which is no surprise.

1:42:23.659 --> 1:42:27.769
Whenever you leave a room,
there's always a great big gap.

1:42:27.770 --> 1:42:30.747
Just how life with you is.

1:42:30.748 --> 1:42:34.776
Anyway, I want you to know
that I don't blame you

1:42:34.777 --> 1:42:36.587
for being angry.

1:42:36.588 --> 1:42:41.586
The way I shot my gob off, I'd
walk out myself if I could.

1:42:41.756 --> 1:42:43.614
Hey, leave it to me to
finally find my passion

1:42:43.615 --> 1:42:46.447
and use it to hurt someone I love.

1:42:50.912 --> 1:42:55.828
But forget me, forget Milan,
forget the boots and business.

1:42:56.847 --> 1:42:58.847
What I wanted to say was

1:43:01.366 --> 1:43:03.634
if anyone ever tries to tell you

1:43:03.635 --> 1:43:06.642
you're something less than a man,

1:43:06.643 --> 1:43:08.809
then you have them see me.

1:43:10.614 --> 1:43:12.282
If being a man means being brave enough

1:43:12.283 --> 1:43:15.311
to take on the entire world,

1:43:15.312 --> 1:43:18.599
then you're the only man I've ever known.

1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:20.183
Certainly the best.

1:43:21.612 --> 1:43:24.778
You challenged Don to change his mind,

1:43:26.142 --> 1:43:28.169
but I'm the one who
really needed that lesson.

1:43:31.988 --> 1:43:35.608
So, this is Charlie from Northampton

1:43:35.609 --> 1:43:37.775
telling Simon from Clacton

1:43:40.659 --> 1:43:42.658
he is so terribly sorry.

1:43:45.977 --> 1:43:47.144
Goodbye, Lola,
