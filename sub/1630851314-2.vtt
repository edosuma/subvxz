21:29.810 --> 21:31.333
We've got to be
missing something.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.683
[heart beating]

21:39.559 --> 21:41.822
Heard there's a psych eval.
It's supposed to be brutal.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.831
I noticed you're a pilot, sir.

21:50.874 --> 21:51.701
Yeah.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.355
May I ask what kind of bird?

21:53.399 --> 21:54.704
Now?

21:54.748 --> 21:57.403
We may not get the chance later.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.406
Uh, Hornets.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.108
This whole time,
I thought we were being tested.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.198
But weweren't.

22:13.593 --> 22:16.813
There are no Hornets
in the Air Force,

22:16.857 --> 22:18.902
Colonel.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.255
Business card reads,

22:24.299 --> 22:26.519
"You have questions.

22:26.562 --> 22:29.217
The answers lie right here."

22:39.967 --> 22:42.404
Bronze Star, Air Medal.

22:43.187 --> 22:45.581
Your salad bar's so impressive,
I almost missed the flaw

22:45.625 --> 22:47.017
in your Commander's Badge.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.497
I overslept.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.412
I...Colonels don't oversleep.

22:50.456 --> 22:51.544
Integrity first,

22:51.587 --> 22:52.936
service before self

22:52.980 --> 22:54.895
and excellence
in all that we do.

22:54.938 --> 22:58.028
The core values
of the Air Force, represented

22:58.072 --> 23:01.118
by three diamonds underneath
the star of this badge.

23:01.162 --> 23:04.470
Except your badge
has four diamonds.

23:14.610 --> 23:16.046
[groans]

23:16.090 --> 23:18.875
Lost the office pool
by six minutes.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.703
[laughs]

23:20.747 --> 23:22.313
You care for a soda?

23:22.357 --> 23:25.404
The chemists on level three
make it in-house.

23:35.718 --> 23:38.808
You said that your work
in Roswell was lost forever.

23:38.852 --> 23:41.158
Well, for a moment,
I would like to explore

23:41.202 --> 23:43.291
a slightly different
possibility.

23:43.334 --> 23:44.684
This rum is a type

23:44.727 --> 23:46.425
that some people thought
would never be made again,

23:46.468 --> 23:47.600
mainly because the trees

23:47.643 --> 23:48.905
that the barrels
were made from--

23:48.949 --> 23:50.516
the barrels being a
very important part

23:50.559 --> 23:51.908
of making rum, as I'm
sure you know-- well,

23:51.952 --> 23:53.344
that tree no longer exists.

23:53.388 --> 23:54.737
But do you think
that the rum makers

23:54.781 --> 23:56.304
let that stop them?

23:56.347 --> 23:59.133
Uh, is there a way
to make you stop this?

23:59.176 --> 24:01.657
In both cases,
the correct answer would be no.

24:01.701 --> 24:02.876
They found samples

24:02.919 --> 24:04.007
of the extinct tree in, uh,

24:04.051 --> 24:05.269
you know, old antique furniture,

24:05.313 --> 24:06.619
burnt-out barns...

24:06.662 --> 24:08.229
Yeah, if there's a point,
let's just get there.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.361
They made booze
from germinated bacterium.

24:10.405 --> 24:12.102
Extinct bacterium.

24:12.146 --> 24:15.715
My point is nothing is
lost forever, Roswell.

24:15.758 --> 24:19.240
We will find a way. I promise.

24:19.283 --> 24:20.937
You're a genius.

24:20.981 --> 24:22.765
Uh...

24:22.809 --> 24:24.593
Where are you going?Uh, dinner.

24:24.637 --> 24:25.551
This Friday. Italian.

24:25.594 --> 24:28.467
And I like the ocean.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.473
Well, that worked.

24:35.561 --> 24:39.347
All right. What is up here
that connects to your vision?

24:39.390 --> 24:41.741
Technically? Nothing.

24:41.784 --> 24:44.352
We're here
to trigger my next one.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.746
What? I-I thought you said
you couldn't control them.

24:46.789 --> 24:50.358
I can't. But I think adrenaline
is a way to trick my mind.

24:50.401 --> 24:53.143
I-If this is what
I think it is...What do you think this is?

24:53.187 --> 24:55.537
Listen, I don't know
how these visions work.

24:55.581 --> 24:57.931
But I know
when I'm afraid for my life,

24:57.974 --> 25:00.499
I get another glimpse.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.240
So...

25:04.241 --> 25:05.634
[exhales]

25:05.678 --> 25:09.333
[grunts]
So, I'm gonna jump off the roof.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.467
You're gonna catch me.

25:13.642 --> 25:14.861
Get back from the ledge, Maria.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.427
You want to know whose
funeral it was, too.

25:16.471 --> 25:17.994
But none of us
want to go to yours.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.692
If you don't get down,
I'm calling this in.

25:19.735 --> 25:20.823
No, you won't.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.608
I got a 10-51...

25:23.522 --> 25:24.566
[grunts]

25:24.610 --> 25:25.785
Do you really trust the guy

25:25.828 --> 25:27.351
that just short-circuited
his own radio?

25:27.395 --> 25:29.223
Not at all. But I
know when I'm scared,

25:29.266 --> 25:31.355
it triggers another vision.KYLE:
This isn't gonna work.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.053
His heart isn't strong
enough to catch you.

25:33.096 --> 25:34.794
There's a part of the vision
I didn't share yet.

25:34.837 --> 25:38.058
After Alex said that we
were covering up a murder,

25:38.101 --> 25:39.886
I said that it was all my fault.

25:39.929 --> 25:41.583
That could mean a lot of things.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.106
None of them I can live with.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.762
This is reckless.That's kind of the point.

25:46.806 --> 25:48.808
We can find a different way.We don't have time!

25:48.851 --> 25:50.679
Maria, my heart.Think fast, Evans.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.725
No!Maria, don't!

25:52.768 --> 25:55.075
[panting]

26:03.779 --> 26:05.607
Thanks a lot, Guerin!

26:05.651 --> 26:08.175
Do you want to tell me why
you just jumped off a building?

26:08.218 --> 26:11.134
Max was supposed to catch me.
What are you doing here?

26:11.178 --> 26:12.614
If Max even tried to catch you,

26:12.658 --> 26:14.442
he'd be puking his guts out
right now.

26:14.485 --> 26:15.661
Yeah, I know that.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.097
That's why I asked him, not you.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.926
I needed to be scared.

26:19.969 --> 26:22.711
Your abilities are the only ones
that don't have limits.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.974
You really never noticed that?

26:28.587 --> 26:30.589
What?

26:31.720 --> 26:33.853
I'm not like you, Guerin.

26:33.896 --> 26:35.637
I can't just sit
on a barstool somewhere,

26:35.681 --> 26:36.856
pretending that nothing matters.

26:36.899 --> 26:39.423
Someone is getting murdered.

26:40.163 --> 26:42.078
If I have to
scare myself to death

26:42.122 --> 26:45.691
to find out who and why,
I'm damn well gonna do it.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.567
[sighs]

26:53.612 --> 26:56.527
Have you made up your mind yet?

26:56.571 --> 26:57.659
About killing me?

26:57.703 --> 26:59.792
[chuckles]

27:01.794 --> 27:03.752
What would you do?

27:03.796 --> 27:05.798
If you were us?

27:07.277 --> 27:08.670
Depends.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.846
How bad is he?

27:12.239 --> 27:15.634
I could tell he was sick
the moment I touched him.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.725
How long have I been down here?

27:19.768 --> 27:23.424
A week? A month?

27:23.467 --> 27:24.468
A year.

27:24.512 --> 27:26.993
And now...

27:27.036 --> 27:30.126
Max is running out of time.

27:44.010 --> 27:46.795
I know you're upset
about Wyatt.

♪ Every step is moving...

27:48.797 --> 27:52.845
What's the point in trying if
I can never escape who I was?

27:53.846 --> 27:55.021
You already have.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.762
You've been sober
for almost a year now.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.938
Rosalinda has been sober.

27:58.981 --> 28:01.854
Rosa is not even
supposed to exist.

28:01.897 --> 28:04.160
Okay, I-I could
have one bad day

28:04.204 --> 28:06.380
and literally lose everything.

28:06.423 --> 28:10.558
Is this really
about what happened with Wyatt?

28:10.601 --> 28:12.821
Or is it about you?

28:12.865 --> 28:14.518
'Cause as far
as I can tell,

28:14.562 --> 28:16.825
for the first time
in a long time,

28:16.869 --> 28:18.392
you're really trying.

28:18.435 --> 28:20.829
♪ We walk on the moon...

28:20.873 --> 28:23.092
That must be scary.

28:23.136 --> 28:26.661
I mean, what if you fail?

28:30.578 --> 28:32.449
Exactly.

28:32.493 --> 28:33.973
What if I do fail?

28:34.016 --> 28:37.498
[inhales]
Hmm.

28:37.541 --> 28:40.936
Lately, I've been feeling like
failing's all I do.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.590
[chuckles softly]

28:42.633 --> 28:44.940
I can't tell if it's
a reason to give up

28:44.984 --> 28:46.768
or if it's a reason
to keep going.

28:46.812 --> 28:49.597
I mean, obviously,
you should keep going.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.468
If you quit, people die.

28:51.512 --> 28:54.341
Death isn't the only reason
to try.

28:54.384 --> 28:55.864
You know?

28:57.692 --> 29:00.173
Life's a pretty good reason
in and of itself.

29:09.835 --> 29:12.838
You still pissed at me?

29:12.881 --> 29:15.841
Less, considering
you spent the day

29:15.884 --> 29:17.930
helping to keep Maria
in one piece.

29:18.974 --> 29:20.933
Well, that's progress.

29:20.976 --> 29:23.762
I want to see how you do
in the bonus round.

29:25.938 --> 29:30.029
You remember anything else
about the home planet?

29:30.072 --> 29:31.770
About Jones?

29:33.467 --> 29:34.903
I should've asked you
a year ago.

29:34.947 --> 29:36.339
I know. I didn't want to.

29:36.383 --> 29:40.039
I can't afford
to ignore it any longer, can I?

29:41.867 --> 29:43.782
You're about to die.

29:45.435 --> 29:48.003
There's no more time
to be stupid

29:49.875 --> 29:51.833
Well, I'm sorry.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.140
I was scared, too.

29:54.183 --> 29:56.751
Yeah, I thought
if I could just cowboy my way

29:56.795 --> 29:59.841
into my final sunset,
then I wouldn't have to...

29:59.885 --> 30:02.583
face the hard part.

30:05.281 --> 30:07.544
I did remember something.

30:09.590 --> 30:12.288
It's more a feeling
than an actual...

30:12.332 --> 30:15.596
an actual memory, but...

30:15.639 --> 30:18.860
[sighs]
That night we found Jones,

30:18.904 --> 30:21.167
I saw something.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.867
See, I had always thought
Louise was

30:25.911 --> 30:28.348
setting me free.

30:28.391 --> 30:29.958

30:30.002 --> 30:33.222
But now I don't know.

30:35.572 --> 30:39.054
I-I don't know if her and Nora

30:39.098 --> 30:41.665
were trying to save me...

30:42.666 --> 30:44.625
...or...

30:46.018 --> 30:50.239
...trying to stop Jones
from rescuing me away.

30:52.067 --> 30:55.027
I just remember I ran to him.

30:58.291 --> 31:00.859
And that he felt safe.

31:03.687 --> 31:06.821
I didn't want to ruin
your memories of your mother

31:06.865 --> 31:09.868

barely understand.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.784
I get it.

31:13.828 --> 31:17.571
There's no "guy who shows up
with your face" handbook, okay?

That's why I need you to
finish the cage, Michael.

31:25.100 --> 31:27.189

31:28.364 --> 31:30.627
What kind of answers?

31:30.671 --> 31:32.412
I'm a clone.

31:33.587 --> 31:37.330
Somebody made me,
and I want to know why.

31:40.028 --> 31:43.249
There's a reason I exist,

31:43.292 --> 31:48.907

in a cave in the desert.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.257
I don't know. I mean,

31:51.300 --> 31:53.999
I guess I always
deep-down knew that...

Only thing I know for sure is...

32:03.095 --> 32:06.489
I got to talk to Jones. Now.

32:10.754 --> 32:15.368
'Cause I can't face my maker
till I face him first.

32:17.326 --> 32:19.763
'Cause maybe
they are one and the same.

Does anybody?

I don't know. I'm not exactly
in fightin' shape.

32:50.272 --> 32:51.970
Do you want to?

32:52.013 --> 32:54.842
I traveled across the galaxy
to save that kid.

32:54.885 --> 32:58.019
I told myself,
if I could do right by him,

32:58.063 --> 33:00.195
maybe it would erase

33:00.239 --> 33:01.892
everything I've done.

33:01.936 --> 33:03.024
Ain't nothin' changed.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.983
Well...

33:08.116 --> 33:11.076
I wouldn't drink it all
at once if I were you.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.994
Your liver's probably
not doing so hot.

33:18.692 --> 33:20.737
You should know...

33:22.696 --> 33:27.179
...when I touched Max, I didn't
just see that he was sick.

33:27.222 --> 33:30.225
I caught glimpses
of a lot of things.

33:30.269 --> 33:33.098
Like how much
you love those boys,

33:33.141 --> 33:35.317
and how much they love you.

33:36.362 --> 33:38.668
I saw something else, too.

33:39.408 --> 33:42.063
They underestimate you,
don't they?

33:45.327 --> 33:47.112
Let me guess.

33:47.155 --> 33:49.157
You don't.

33:50.332 --> 33:53.596
All I'm saying is
I'm not surprised.

33:54.641 --> 33:56.947
Same thing happened
to your mother.

33:56.991 --> 34:01.213
People thought she was weak
because she felt things.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.171
The truth is, she was...

34:03.215 --> 34:05.304
she was good.

34:05.347 --> 34:08.089
Yeah, but...

34:08.133 --> 34:11.527
Louise was so, so strong.

34:13.573 --> 34:15.183
Once in a blue moon,

34:15.227 --> 34:17.968
maybe we're blessed
with someone who's both.
