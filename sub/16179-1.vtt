01:04.998 --> 01:06.534
You're a generation of lazy.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.542
You haven't done anything
for yourself.

01:09.837 --> 01:13.216
But I'm gonna teach you
how to do...

01:16.109 --> 01:17.884
Chelsea...

01:18.178 --> 01:20.784
Chels.

01:22.349 --> 01:23.726
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:24.017 --> 01:25.496
Mom and dad are outta town.

01:25.786 --> 01:26.786
So you get me.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.627
I don't need a babysitter.

01:28.889 --> 01:29.889
Whatever.

01:30.057 --> 01:32.059
Get ready for school.

01:51.411 --> 01:52.754
Shaq...

01:53.046 --> 01:56.584
This is the best vacation ever.

01:56.884 --> 02:00.730
I can't believe you own
this whole island.

02:01.021 --> 02:03.262
You have to be the hottest,

02:03.557 --> 02:05.161
most successful,

02:05.425 --> 02:10.101
smart and funny guy
I've ever met.

02:10.396 --> 02:14.436
I'd do anything for you,
Shaquille Horowitz.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.614
And I mean anything.

02:22.242 --> 02:23.585
I'm here to save you

02:23.877 --> 02:24.947
from yourself

02:25.245 --> 02:27.589
now, in the comfort
of your home,

02:27.881 --> 02:29.189
you can have...

02:29.449 --> 02:32.430
"The winner's win, the
losers whine" seminar.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.892
Leaders of men,
leaders of countries,

02:35.188 --> 02:38.465
have taken the dynamic,
fantastic course.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.534
"Winners win,
losers whine."

02:40.794 --> 02:43.468
They've changed
the course of countries.

02:43.764 --> 02:44.868
Winners win.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.805
You're the man.
No...

02:47.100 --> 02:48.100
No, you're the man.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.610
Is that chest hair?

02:49.903 --> 02:51.246
I think it might be.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.108
I'm the only one in control.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.613
I'm the only one in control.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.888
I'm Wilford gates,

02:57.144 --> 02:59.784
and I'm passionate
about your success.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.080
Gates?

03:01.281 --> 03:02.601
You wanna give me
the scholarship?

03:15.162 --> 03:17.164
Shaq.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.169
Uh, hey dad.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.173
Hey. What...

03:22.469 --> 03:23.469
What's going on with you?

03:28.976 --> 03:30.011
Nothing.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.153
Yeah, well, you look like

03:32.446 --> 03:33.982
"honey, I shrunk
my accountant."

03:34.281 --> 03:35.988
Look dad, in order
to be successful

03:36.283 --> 03:39.196
one has to dress successful, so.

03:39.486 --> 03:42.831
That depends on your
definition of success, really.

03:43.123 --> 03:46.593
Well, speaking of that,
how's the job hunt going?

03:46.860 --> 03:48.203
Oh, it's going...
It's going...

03:48.495 --> 03:50.998
Cause, you know, just got
a couple of leads, but-...

03:51.298 --> 03:52.898
I mean they're all-
you know, they're all

03:53.133 --> 03:54.874
multi-national
corporations and things...

03:55.168 --> 03:56.340
You know...
It's-â€” I can't-

03:56.637 --> 03:58.207
that's not-

03:58.505 --> 03:59.984
you know...
I mean seriously,

04:00.273 --> 04:02.810
where are all the
locally-owned companies?

04:03.110 --> 04:04.851
You know, like, family
business, you know.

04:05.145 --> 04:05.850
Where are those things?

04:06.146 --> 04:07.181
I can't...
I can't...

04:07.481 --> 04:08.516
I mean, you know me,

04:08.815 --> 04:10.658
when I'm... when I'm
looking at the...

04:10.951 --> 04:12.453
And I see the-
I can't...

04:12.719 --> 04:14.721
So I'm just...
I'm gonna keep looking.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.502
Just keep-
you know, like...

04:17.791 --> 04:19.134
That's a good plan.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.670
Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty
good, pretty good.

04:22.963 --> 04:23.963
I should go.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.404
Yeah'? Oh yeah,
you got school.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.476
- Good... cool. Go.
- See you later, dad.

04:29.736 --> 04:33.843
Shaq, thanks. I'm glad
we had this talk.

04:41.381 --> 04:43.059
You can't be
running around wearing skinny jeans,

04:43.083 --> 04:44.926
having a haircut like
a bad dyke from the '80s,

04:45.218 --> 04:46.322
you have to embrace change.

04:46.586 --> 04:49.260
You have to embrace the new you.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.234
Otherwise you're gonna end up
living under a bridge.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.535
Do you wanna end up
living under a bridge?

04:52.559 --> 04:53.879
'Cause that's where
you're headed,

04:53.927 --> 04:56.271
unless you're ready
to be successful.

04:56.563 --> 04:59.803
You can't become successful by hating
successful people. You have to embrace them.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.393
You have to go out there, and
you have to get what you want.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.242
You have to
live your life like you're...

05:16.516 --> 05:18.621
Butt-faced again.

05:18.919 --> 05:22.059
Woo-hoo.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.764
Christ, you get a government
job I don't know about?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.459
Uh, no, I have a meeting
with brew today.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.596
Oh, yeah? Where at?

05:28.895 --> 05:30.397
Cock in the box?
Cock fillet?

05:30.697 --> 05:31.698
Kentucky fried cock?

05:31.965 --> 05:33.638
McCockles?
McCockles, really?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.814
Oh, I should've stopped
at cock in the box, huh?

05:36.103 --> 05:37.605
Yeah. You need
to be nice to him.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.304
Dude, the guy's
a cock gobbling tool

05:39.372 --> 05:40.883
who thinks he's better
than everyone else.

05:40.907 --> 05:43.251
- No, he's successful.
- Yeah, at gobbling cock.

05:43.543 --> 05:46.583
Seriously, don't fuck this up for me.
Please? I really want this scholarship.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.925
I thought you were going to community
college with me and Chelsea.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.193
Well, I was, but that was before

05:50.217 --> 05:51.491
I could afford to go to SMU.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.731
With the scholarship,
I can afford to go to SMU.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.728
Dude, I can afford it,
but you don't see me

05:55.989 --> 05:57.269
running off
to some fancy college

05:57.491 --> 05:58.993
to get with
a bunch of pod people

05:59.292 --> 06:00.635
and leaving my friends.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.065
You have a 1.75 GPA,

06:02.329 --> 06:03.689
you're lucky
to get into community.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.334
I don't test well.
And you know that.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.276
Did you at least remember
to get the costume?

06:07.300 --> 06:08.506
Yeah,
it's in the back. You?

06:08.802 --> 06:09.802
Yeah. What's yours?

06:09.903 --> 06:11.280
Oh, man.
It's a pussy magnet.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.245
Wait till you see.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.313
What the fuck?

06:26.653 --> 06:28.257
Hey, I picked up a shift
this morning.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.762
Can you take Sage to school?

06:30.023 --> 06:31.331
Yeah, no problem.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.502
Okay, don't let your retard
friend say anything

06:33.794 --> 06:36.035
that's gonna scar her,
all right?

06:36.329 --> 06:37.433
She's only 11.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.335
They're not retarded.
Shell be fine.

06:39.633 --> 06:40.976
Who's retarded?

06:41.268 --> 06:42.645
Hey, sweetie, you need
to ride with Chelsea

06:42.669 --> 06:43.669
to school today, okay?

06:43.837 --> 06:45.282
What?

06:49.709 --> 06:51.848
I don't wanna ride her
and her freak friends.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.647
You don't have a choice, babe.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.153
I can ride the bus.

06:55.448 --> 06:56.859
Not in this neighborhood,
you can't.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.130
We learned about
self-defense in gym class.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.388
Testicles, throat, eyes.

07:06.993 --> 07:09.371
You're riding with your sister today.
Deal with it.

07:09.663 --> 07:13.133
But sideshow smells
like spoiled lunch meat.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.243
Hey, this should go
without saying,

07:15.535 --> 07:17.344
no smoking weed
with her in the car.

07:17.637 --> 07:20.880
Weed? What is this
weed you speak of?

07:23.577 --> 07:24.920
Seriously, a joint'?

07:25.212 --> 07:26.555
It's like 8:30
in the morning.

07:26.847 --> 07:27.847
All right, first of all,

07:27.981 --> 07:29.085
it's medical.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.191
I have anxiety issues
and you know that.

07:31.484 --> 07:32.804
Whatever,
I just don't wanna smell

07:32.986 --> 07:35.193
like that stuff all day.

07:35.488 --> 07:36.488
Hey, is that Van Horn?

07:36.723 --> 07:38.725
Yeah, I think so.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.398
What's up fellas?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.042
Whats up?

07:51.738 --> 07:53.445
You bussing it'?

07:53.740 --> 07:55.549
Yeah, uh, my car is in the shop

07:55.842 --> 07:57.617
till this afternoon.
It's a long story.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.618
Fucking stop sign
was behind a tree.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.790
Nice mouth. What's up
with the Amber alert?

08:02.082 --> 08:04.119
That's chin chin,
she's my girlfriend.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.398
Chin chin, say hi to my friends.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.698
Nice. Where'd you pick her up,
a "Harry Potter" book signing?

08:17.964 --> 08:18.964
Man, fuck you, sha-queer.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.568
She's hot as fuck, man.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.438
And you're just jealous 'cause
the last time you felt vagina.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.257
You were being born
out of your mother.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.074
And that's disgusting.

08:27.374 --> 08:28.374
Nice car.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.543
- Thanks.
- Can I drive it?

08:30.810 --> 08:32.585
- Uh, sure.
- No, no, you can't.

08:32.879 --> 08:34.318
- What's the big deal?
- Megan's law.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.655
We should really git going.

08:35.948 --> 08:39.054
Okay, can we at least
get a ride? You got room.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.730
Seriously?

08:40.986 --> 08:43.490
Fuck you, sha-queer.
Fuck you, too.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.762
He's a douche bag.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.274
Dude, whoa.
Be cool.

08:51.564 --> 08:52.924
I won't be cool,
he's a douche bag.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.737
- Yeah, but you know he's...
- He's what?

08:55.001 --> 08:56.001
- He's got the...
- What?

08:56.269 --> 08:57.612
He's kinda...
He's handicapped.

08:57.904 --> 08:59.315
What? So he gets
a free pass because of that?

08:59.339 --> 09:00.549
That guy walks
around like he's king,

09:00.573 --> 09:02.075
but he's really
just a douche bag.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.552
And by the way, they don't
say, "handicapped,"

09:03.576 --> 09:04.919
they say,
"physically challenged."

09:05.178 --> 09:07.522
Are you sure? I think
handicapped is okay.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.521
No, it's not okay.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.610
- Th ey still call it "handicap parking."
- No, they don't.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.205
What up. Peeps?

09:23.496 --> 09:25.256
Shaq, can you
check out my printer?

09:25.298 --> 09:28.040
Uh, sure.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.935
You told Chels
to get Shaq out of the way

09:30.003 --> 09:33.007
so we could be alone,
didn't you?

09:33.306 --> 09:35.308
You know guys hit their
sexual peak at '18, right?

09:35.608 --> 09:37.315
I'm sitting right here, moron.

09:37.610 --> 09:40.853
I can understand every
skeezy word you say.

09:41.147 --> 09:42.649
Sweetie, you understand

09:42.949 --> 09:46.021
many, many more
words than Marion.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.319
Marion?

09:47.487 --> 09:48.488
It's sideshow.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.131
The name's sideshow.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.063
- Hey...
- Hey.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.737
You.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.507
Uh...

09:56.796 --> 09:58.673
Scene of the crime.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.876
- Yeah...
- That's nice.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.874
Oh, my god.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.513
I was, uh-I was
just messing around earlier.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.011
Yeah...

10:07.307 --> 10:10.049
Uh, so the printer
you wanted me to look at.

10:10.343 --> 10:14.849
Yeah, I don't actually
have a printer.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.923
No, you don't.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.662
Jesus, Shaq.
It's me.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.158
I know.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.731
I'm Shaq.
Nice to meet you.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.224
Are you gonna be a douche bag?

10:25.325 --> 10:27.271
No.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.871
Just...

10:31.164 --> 10:32.164
So what do you wanna do?

10:32.399 --> 10:36.040
I mean, we obviously
had a connection

10:36.336 --> 10:37.906
the other night.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.239
Right?

10:39.539 --> 10:41.246
This is a good brand.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.920
Um...

10:45.211 --> 10:48.556
Chels, you're...
You're like my best friend,

10:48.848 --> 10:53.456
and I wouldn't wanna ruin that.

10:53.753 --> 10:54.753
So...

10:55.021 --> 10:56.625
Fantastic.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.698
Did you get that
off of like some big book

10:58.958 --> 11:00.960
of cliche things assholes say?

11:01.261 --> 11:03.969
Or... you just
came up with that.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.303
Dick.

11:17.310 --> 11:20.655
Chels, Shaq.
Let's go.

11:44.804 --> 11:47.011
Oops. I'm sorry.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.810
That's okay.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.987
You know I'm so hot for you.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.758
I've been wanting
to do this for a long time.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.549
Ahh! What are you doing
with my underwear. You freak?

12:18.838 --> 12:20.349
No, I thought it was Rebecca's.
It's not what it looks like.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.933
- Chelsea!
- I thought it was Rebecca's!

12:21.975 --> 12:24.285
- I thought-hey! No!
- Testicles, throat, eyes!

12:32.118 --> 12:33.278
I didn't know they were hers,

12:33.453 --> 12:34.653
what 11-year-old
wears a thong?

12:34.821 --> 12:36.164
It's the 21 st century, pervert.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.491
I'm not a pervert.

12:37.790 --> 12:38.834
That's some pretty sick shit,

12:38.858 --> 12:39.962
even for you, sideshow.

12:40.226 --> 12:41.426
I thought they were Rebecca's.

12:41.661 --> 12:42.799
He was sniffing them.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.062
- Oh!
- I was not.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.536
I'm burning them, you freak.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.641
Okay, let me off here.
I don't wanna be seen

12:47.901 --> 12:49.574
getting out a car
with two known pervs.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.380
Two? No, no, no.
I'm not-he's the perv.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.077
Tell it to Chris
Hansen, you freaks.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.022
So, uh, how much for all this?

12:59.312 --> 13:02.521
$5.50.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.590
Hey, you...

13:04.884 --> 13:06.864
You wanna see a picture
of my little girl?

13:11.357 --> 13:13.428
Sure...

13:16.329 --> 13:17.330
Ah, she's pretty.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.043
Yeah, she's a child, you freak.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.439
She's into rainbows
and unicorns, not your penis.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.677
Lighten up kid,
I'm just fuckin' with you.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.080
Unicorns...

13:35.615 --> 13:37.356
Bag it up.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.366
I got my eye on you.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.891
So you're going for
the gate scholarship, huh?

14:11.150 --> 14:12.754
Yeah. I was gonna tell
you this morning,

14:13.052 --> 14:15.464
but it was kinda awkward between
us, so I didn't really know...

14:15.488 --> 14:17.533
All of a sudden, he's too
good for community college.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.477
I didn't say that. I
didn't... I didn't say that.

14:19.759 --> 14:22.559
And that's why he's going to Bret-ps
little winter break costume party.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.164
Wait, your cousin Brei I?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.102
You're going to his party?

14:26.399 --> 14:28.140
But you hate him.
He hates you.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.744
I wouldn't really say
"hate" is the word.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.564
You know, what?
Gates is gonna be there,

14:32.739 --> 14:34.059
and it's my chance
to impress him.

14:34.173 --> 14:37.416
Hey, retard. You parked
in a handicapped spot.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.315
See? I told you
it was handicap.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.172
Oh, you know, I didn't see it, man.
Wow.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.926
Yeah, whatever,
sha-queer.

14:43.182 --> 14:45.492
I should kick your
fucking ass right now.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.526
Hey, hobbit.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.822
You calling me cripple?

14:54.294 --> 14:55.602
You're all talk.

14:55.862 --> 14:56.602
I didn't say anything.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.103
Yeah, you did.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.009
That's why I'm getting
the gates scholarship

15:00.033 --> 15:01.110
and you're gonna be homeless

15:01.134 --> 15:03.705
giving hand jobs under a bridge.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.141
Now, move your car.

15:05.438 --> 15:09.045
Well... it is
illegally parked.

15:09.342 --> 15:12.687
Move it.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.390
Dick beater.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.193
Dude, I forgot
my gym shorts again.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.929
- Coach.
- Shit.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.323
So are we cool?

15:54.587 --> 15:57.193
Because this morning
was kinda awkward.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.436
Yeah...
Totally.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.899
BFF.

16:05.164 --> 16:06.644
Dude, what'd you do
to my dad's pants?

16:06.866 --> 16:08.106
Shorts, dude.
Check it out.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.481
No, they're my dad's pants.

16:09.602 --> 16:10.774
I know, you said that.

16:13.339 --> 16:14.717
Why didn't you
just cut your own pants?

16:14.741 --> 16:15.751
Dude, I'm not cutting these,

16:15.775 --> 16:16.515
they're my favorite jeans.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.687
I can't cut these.

16:43.903 --> 16:46.713
Wow, Chels. Those two have
done a lot of growing up.

16:46.973 --> 16:50.477
Okay, but for the record, I said that
Shaq had done a lot of growing up.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.654
Aww. Have we stepped
into Crushville?

16:53.980 --> 16:54.980
Who are you texting?

16:55.214 --> 16:56.557
Oh, just a guy.

17:02.388 --> 17:03.958
You made out with
Shaquille, didn't you?

17:04.257 --> 17:06.099
- Wait, what guy?
- Just someone.

17:06.392 --> 17:08.895
<i>Oh, you got
Shaq-adelic, didn't you'?</i>

17:15.835 --> 17:18.474
Whatever. It was probably
a mistake, anyway.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.011
So what's his name'?

17:20.306 --> 17:21.751
Um...

17:22.008 --> 17:23.768
- God, for fuck's sake. Give me that.
- Stop!

17:23.843 --> 17:24.843
Oh!

17:25.011 --> 17:27.116
- Stop it!
- He's just so hot.

17:27.413 --> 17:30.917
That is so. So,
so not cool.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.664
Why are you keeping
this guy a secret?

17:32.952 --> 17:33.952
It sounds kinda hot.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.464
He is, he's really sweet.

17:36.756 --> 17:37.756
So what's his name'?

17:37.924 --> 17:39.198
Uh, his names Hayden.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.666
Hayden? We don't know
any Haydens, do we?

17:42.962 --> 17:44.270
How long have you been dating?

17:44.530 --> 17:46.271
- Well...
- Well... what?

17:46.532 --> 17:47.533
How long?

17:47.834 --> 17:50.815
Well, we like, text everyday.

17:51.103 --> 17:52.776
Please tell me that you've like,

17:53.039 --> 17:55.542
actually seen this guy
in person, right?

17:55.842 --> 17:57.321
We send pics too.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.318
Jesus...

18:00.613 --> 18:03.560
You know, what? You two have set
our gender back like 20 years

18:03.850 --> 18:05.557
with your little
pseudo relationships.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.331
Awesome.

18:08.554 --> 18:10.966
I sent him a video once too.

18:11.224 --> 18:14.034
Okay, wow. Like you've
never met him in person?

18:14.327 --> 18:16.398
Shut up, you made out with Shaq.

18:18.297 --> 18:19.401
Word.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.099
That's why I think
we should open up

18:21.367 --> 18:24.644
our medical marijuana
retail store.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.383
What'? Think about it.

18:26.672 --> 18:27.673
I know about weed,

18:27.974 --> 18:30.386
and you know
about business stuff.

18:32.078 --> 18:34.217
But coach NUTHERCUT,
isn't he like 30?

18:34.514 --> 18:36.050
Yeah, well,
she is a cheerleader.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.556
I guess the teenage cock
isn't doing it for her.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.991
Speaking of which,
I heard that she is deformed

18:42.255 --> 18:44.496
- in that ar ea.
- What?

18:44.757 --> 18:46.168
Sideshow told me
that Eric told him

18:46.425 --> 18:47.426
that my cousin, Dane...

18:47.727 --> 18:49.400
Dane, from like
dead hooker surprise?

18:49.695 --> 18:51.436
That's the one.
So anyway,

18:51.731 --> 18:52.971
he was like making out with her

18:53.032 --> 18:55.444
and he says that
she has oversized...

18:55.735 --> 18:57.737
An oversized what?

18:58.037 --> 18:59.948
You know...

19:00.239 --> 19:01.239
Eww!

19:03.009 --> 19:04.209
But apparently the hose monkey

19:04.377 --> 19:06.220
does have a talent
for fellatio though.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.719
Oh, I totally respect her now.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.619
Well, what makes her
blow-jobs so great?

19:10.917 --> 19:12.237
I don't know,
maybe the E.T. Bitch

19:12.385 --> 19:13.693
has two heads
like "alien."

19:15.621 --> 19:18.067
Oh, my god.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.894
I would love to make
a cheerleader Popsicle

19:21.193 --> 19:22.729
out of that.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.149
How many licks would it take

19:24.397 --> 19:26.035
to get to the center
of a cheerleader?

19:26.299 --> 19:28.575
Look at that ass.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.246
- That ls an...
- Oh...

19:31.537 --> 19:33.608
Shaquille!
Marion!

19:33.906 --> 19:35.186
Why aren't you
two participating?

19:35.441 --> 19:38.081
- I'm anemic, a little weak.
- I have asthma.

19:38.377 --> 19:39.688
Son, what in the hell
are you wearing?

19:39.712 --> 19:40.816
Shorts, sir.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.624
You look like goddamn
huckleberry hound.

19:42.648 --> 19:43.956
And those aren't shorts.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.295
Actually, shorts are just pants

19:50.456 --> 19:52.060
that you chop off
at the leg, coach.

19:52.325 --> 19:55.465
Precision, granted, but I mean, It's...
- Shaquille!

19:55.761 --> 19:56.967
Shut up!

19:57.263 --> 19:59.903
Son, you're named after
a goddamn sports legend.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.645
And look at you.

20:01.934 --> 20:05.313
Why can't you two be more
like Van Horn over here?

20:07.607 --> 20:09.951
He's dragging himself around.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.188
That silly walk.

20:12.478 --> 20:13.684
Arm all funky.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.254
But you know what?

20:15.514 --> 20:18.620
He doesn't let it stop him
from trying to succeed.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.659
And you two...

20:20.953 --> 20:22.694
Fake asthma.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.629
Anemia. You should be
ashamed of yourself.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.633
Goddamn ashamed.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.837
Hit the track.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.301
Now!

20:34.767 --> 20:37.873
So, do you guys like, think that guys
even care that much about blow-jobs?

20:38.170 --> 20:40.309
You're fucking
kidding me, right?

20:40.606 --> 20:41.812
Yeah, I'm kidding.

20:42.108 --> 20:46.955
Wait, you've never
done it, have you?

20:47.213 --> 20:50.160
- Okay, well, I have sort of.
- Sort of?

20:50.449 --> 20:52.486
I think you'd know if you
had a dick in your mouth.

20:54.286 --> 20:55.697
Okay, well, I've never done it.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.165
So I just want to be good at it

20:57.189 --> 20:59.032
whenever it does happen to me.

20:59.325 --> 21:01.566
Okay.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.137
Come here.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.397
What?

21:05.464 --> 21:06.504
Come on, don't be a prude.

21:06.565 --> 21:07.908
This is purely educational.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.578
Come on.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.488
So dance your tongue
around the tip.

21:18.744 --> 21:21.918
Like a dainty ballerina.

21:22.214 --> 21:23.215
Like this?

21:23.516 --> 21:25.325
Mm-hmm. Okay.

21:25.584 --> 21:27.564
Now put your lips around
your teeth like this.

21:27.853 --> 21:28.864
And that way you don't bite it.

21:28.888 --> 21:29.888
- Okay?
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.524
Now, put it in your mouth,

21:31.824 --> 21:34.270
and go as far down the
shaft as you possibly can.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.669
You like
the smell of that? Yeah?

21:37.930 --> 21:41.104
- It's like sweaty socks and bleach and fish and...
- Aww!

21:48.507 --> 21:50.043
Oh, like, this isn't something

21:50.342 --> 21:52.344
that you don't do every day?

21:52.611 --> 21:53.611
Whatever.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.057
You freaks are the ones in here

21:55.081 --> 21:57.061
making out
with a piece of fruit.

21:57.349 --> 21:58.851
Don't think
this won't get around.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.688
You're a joke.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.126
Everybody already
thinks your air band...

22:03.422 --> 22:04.422
Is pathetic as fuck.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.643
- Hey, we're not just an air band-
- that... hold on.

22:13.933 --> 22:17.312
You know, what? You have fucked the
majority of the athletic department

22:17.603 --> 22:19.043
and you're currently
working your way

22:19.105 --> 22:21.210
through third string
junior varsity.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.750
You skanks just wish
you could get laid.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.546
Fact is, nobody
wants anything to do

22:26.812 --> 22:28.120
with a dyke air band.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.014
Look, I know you can't
help what happened

22:30.249 --> 22:31.489
between you and your stepfather

22:31.717 --> 22:33.253
when you were like 13, Lolita,

22:33.552 --> 22:34.929
but for the love of baby Jesus,

22:35.221 --> 22:37.599
keep the whisker biscuit
in your pants.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.767
Yeah, I mean,
some people are saying

22:40.059 --> 22:42.596
that your oversized lips

22:42.895 --> 22:45.398
are scaring some guys for life.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.986
Attention students.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.255
I'd like to personally announce

22:58.511 --> 23:00.115
that we are dedicating

23:00.412 --> 23:02.688
the east side of the cafeteria

23:02.982 --> 23:07.453
to memory of Jose Jimenez.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.755
Jose was a great student,

23:10.022 --> 23:11.933
and a great friend to many.

23:12.191 --> 23:15.297
And although I had
hardly knew he was,

23:15.594 --> 23:19.872
I'm sure he hung out with the other
Mexican-American students at our school.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.509
Where do you think you're going?

23:21.801 --> 23:23.303
And where are
your spirit ribbons?

23:23.602 --> 23:25.707
Listen up, you ungrateful freak.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.005
You think it's easy

23:27.273 --> 23:28.809
trotting around
in this tiny uniform

23:29.108 --> 23:30.815
in a school filled
with geeks, freaks,

23:31.110 --> 23:32.953
and future sex offenders?

23:33.212 --> 23:34.212
Now...

23:34.480 --> 23:35.880
You're gonna put
on a spirit ribbon,

23:35.981 --> 23:38.291
and act like you care
about the game.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.010
- Hey.
- Aren't you supposed to be in school?

24:13.085 --> 24:15.361
It's lunch time.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.191
Hey, Brett.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.565
Oh. If it isn't
Shaquille.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.364
Shaquille o'white guy.

24:29.568 --> 24:30.945
Yeah, that's awesome.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.277
So do you guys like call
each other up every morning

24:33.405 --> 24:34.406
and decide what to wear?

24:34.707 --> 24:35.742
Listen, Shrek.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.241
If I wanted to hear you speak,

24:37.343 --> 24:38.913
I would've acknowledged
your presence.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.722
Side, why don't you
go order something.

24:40.746 --> 24:41.747
Let the men talk.

24:42.047 --> 24:43.390
Whatever.

24:43.682 --> 24:46.595
Why don't you try a mouthful
of your uncle's cock?

24:46.886 --> 24:49.958
I hear it's a childhood
favorite of yours.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.793
I just want to thank you
for the opportunity...

24:55.094 --> 24:56.534
- You know, I'm honored...
- Save it.

24:56.595 --> 24:58.131
I'm doing it as
a favor for my dad.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.950
I still think you're
a fucking outcast.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.272
You're not one of us.

25:01.567 --> 25:02.637
Look, I've changed, okay'?

25:02.935 --> 25:04.710
I'm-I'm going to evolve
and I've decided

25:04.970 --> 25:07.211
that I wanna be
successful like you.

25:07.473 --> 25:09.214
Now, hold on. Before
you get all emotional,

25:09.475 --> 25:11.216
and earnest
on us, Dr. Phil.

25:11.477 --> 25:12.820
I should tell you.

25:13.112 --> 25:16.093
The party's been cancelled.

25:16.382 --> 25:18.055
No... no, no, no.

25:18.317 --> 25:19.317
Why?

25:19.385 --> 25:20.989
Well, if you must know.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.647
My parents
are fumigating the house

25:22.788 --> 25:24.961
for termites this weekend.

25:25.257 --> 25:28.466
So, no location, no party.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.297
No party, no Brett.

25:30.596 --> 25:32.098
No Brett, no gates.

25:32.398 --> 25:33.775
Sorry.

25:34.066 --> 25:36.103
Wait, um, we could
have it at my house.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.507
Your house is shithole.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.112
It is a shithole.
Umm...

25:40.406 --> 25:42.166
Sideshow's... we could
have it at sideshow's-

25:42.241 --> 25:43.652
sideshow has a fantastic house

25:43.943 --> 25:48.483
and his parents are going
to be gone for the weekend.

25:48.781 --> 25:51.762
- No shit?
- No shit.

25:52.017 --> 25:54.520
Are you sure you can pull
off a college party?

25:54.820 --> 25:57.994
I don't want a bunch of
warcraft, halo playin' virgins,

25:58.290 --> 26:00.429
standing around
eating chips and dip

26:00.693 --> 26:02.502
scaring off all
the symmetrical tail.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.832
- You understand?
- I do. I do.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.741
And you don't have
anything to worry about

26:06.765 --> 26:09.041
because I have thrown

26:09.335 --> 26:11.815
quite a few badass parties.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.138
- No high school kids.
- None.

26:20.212 --> 26:23.318
None. No worries.
I got it.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.060
Well, you should get to work

26:25.351 --> 26:26.557
run along then.

26:26.852 --> 26:28.695
I'm gonna go.
Gonna go.

26:28.988 --> 26:31.662
I would totally rub your feet.

26:31.957 --> 26:33.402
In fact, put 'em up here.

26:33.692 --> 26:36.332
Never think about my feet, okay?

26:36.628 --> 26:37.629
Hey, let's go.

26:37.896 --> 26:39.569
- I'm eating pie.
- Forget about your pie.

26:39.865 --> 26:41.208
Shaq. Hi...

26:41.500 --> 26:43.571
Rebecca...
It was good.

26:43.869 --> 26:45.371
Let's go.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.322
Oh, hey, can we stop
by my friend's house?

26:54.580 --> 26:55.991
I gotta pick something
up real quick.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.015
What friend?

26:57.082 --> 26:58.083
Um...
Just a guy.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.494
Wait, wait,
no, no, no, no, no...

26:59.518 --> 27:01.361
Dude, dude, calm down.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.893
- Don't be such a "Debbie downer"
- I'm a "Debbie downer"

27:03.922 --> 27:05.722
because I don't want
a drug deal on my record.

27:05.858 --> 27:08.018
I can't get into college
with a drug deal on my record.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.860
A drug deal'? What are
you talking about?

27:09.895 --> 27:11.431
Drug deal?
This isn't "Miami vice."

27:11.730 --> 27:13.930
I'm not going to buy ten keys
of coke from Tony Montana,

27:14.099 --> 27:15.099
all right?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.508
This is rover.
He's cool.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.009
Sonny Crockett is "Miami vice,"

27:18.070 --> 27:19.413
Tony Montana
is "Scarface."

27:19.705 --> 27:21.116
You really should know this

27:21.407 --> 27:24.047
- you're a dude.
- Okay, whatever. The point is,

27:24.343 --> 27:26.016
I'm going in there
to buy some weed, okay?

27:26.278 --> 27:27.848
Personal use,
saw it on the news,

27:28.113 --> 27:30.115
it's perfectly legal.
Medical marijuana.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.191
Oh yeah, first off,
you're an idiot.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.732
Second off, you need a prescription
for medical marijuana,

27:34.953 --> 27:36.498
which you don't have,
and even if you did,

27:36.522 --> 27:38.099
you can't buy it from
some guy named rover,

27:38.123 --> 27:39.898
you need to buy it from
a licensed facility.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.392
Okay, well, it's almost legal.

27:41.560 --> 27:42.732
No, it's not.

27:45.631 --> 27:46.939
Okay, and hey, don't be asking

27:47.232 --> 27:48.632
any of your weird
fucking questions.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.974
What weird questions?

27:50.269 --> 27:52.269
You're like MONTEL Williams
when you meet somebody.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.476
Just sit there and shut up.

27:53.772 --> 27:54.812
No, no, I make small talk.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.610
I'm good at it.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.909
Okay, well, no.
People think it's weird.

27:58.977 --> 28:00.650
Just don't do it.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.060
Hey, rover!

28:12.324 --> 28:14.133
What the fuck?

28:19.798 --> 28:21.398
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck is he?

28:21.567 --> 28:22.978
Hey, rover.
What's going on, man?

28:23.268 --> 28:25.270
Fuck how it's going,
and what's going on.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.778
Who the fuck is this
little motherfucker.

28:28.073 --> 28:29.717
Dude, don't worry, he's a
friend of mine, he's cool.

28:29.741 --> 28:30.981
I'll decide who's fucking cool,

28:31.176 --> 28:32.655
now who the fuck are you?

28:32.945 --> 28:34.322
- I said, he's a friend of mine.
- Shh.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.792
- His names Shaq.
- Did I ask you?

28:37.082 --> 28:39.084
I asked him. What the
fuck is wrong with him?

28:39.351 --> 28:40.830
He can't talk?
You can't talk?

28:41.120 --> 28:42.793
You some kind of
mute or something?

28:43.088 --> 28:45.159
Or are you an undercover cop?

28:45.457 --> 28:46.595
Huh?

28:46.859 --> 28:48.136
Observe and report,
is that your thing?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.640
I'm not a cop.
He told me not to talk.

28:49.928 --> 28:51.100
- He...
- What?

28:51.363 --> 28:53.043
Why would you tell him
not to fucking talk?

28:53.298 --> 28:54.909
It's no big deal, man,
I just didn't want him to say

28:54.933 --> 28:55.973
anything to freak you out.

28:56.034 --> 28:57.234
What is this guy liable to say

28:57.503 --> 29:01.474
that's gonna be fucking
freaking me out, man?

29:01.773 --> 29:03.377
I'll tell you what.

29:03.675 --> 29:04.915
He's freaking me out right now,

29:04.943 --> 29:07.321
and he ain't saying shit.

29:09.314 --> 29:12.352
Creepy-eyed motherfucker.

29:14.653 --> 29:17.497
I got my eye on you, columbine.

29:24.329 --> 29:25.899
All right.

29:27.232 --> 29:28.302
Come on.

29:35.841 --> 29:38.515
I told you, it's like a nest
for retards, this house.

29:38.810 --> 29:40.153
Huh?

29:40.412 --> 29:41.452
- Let's party!
- All right.

29:41.713 --> 29:42.748
- Let's do it!
- Yes.

29:46.351 --> 29:50.322
This is some
top-level shit.

29:51.857 --> 29:53.034
None of that
ghetto-ass dirt weed

29:53.058 --> 29:54.258
them Julios be trying to push.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.028
This...

29:57.396 --> 29:59.000
Is premium velvet.

29:59.264 --> 30:00.572
More THC per ounce

30:00.866 --> 30:04.336
than any other weed
on the motherfucking planet.

30:04.603 --> 30:06.378
Now...

30:06.672 --> 30:09.175
I call it the equalizer

30:09.441 --> 30:12.285
because I don't care
who you are.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.353
Be it the janitor,

30:14.613 --> 30:17.856
or the president
of the United States

30:18.116 --> 30:21.791
of the motherfucking world.

30:24.022 --> 30:25.729
When you smoke this shit,

30:26.024 --> 30:28.800
you're all gonna
be on the same level.

30:29.094 --> 30:31.404
Laying on the floor,

30:31.697 --> 30:34.940
staring at the ceilings.

30:35.234 --> 30:39.580
Not thinking about
a motherfucking thing.

30:48.780 --> 30:52.250
Hey!

30:54.953 --> 30:56.830
Shit.
This weed might make

30:57.122 --> 31:00.501
your ol' creepy eyes
over here even cooler.

31:00.792 --> 31:01.869
Why do you keep saying that?

31:01.893 --> 31:04.806
I'm not creepy.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.269
I'm not.

31:06.565 --> 31:10.138
Oh, you're creepy, all right.

31:10.435 --> 31:14.781
But hey, I mean,
I'm cool with it.

31:15.073 --> 31:18.646
I don't cast dispersions.

31:18.944 --> 31:22.255
Now, make no mistake, about it,

31:22.514 --> 31:25.620
you're a creepy little fucker.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.464
This is $250.

32:11.997 --> 32:14.008
Are you crazy? We can't throw
a party at my parents' house,

32:14.032 --> 32:15.807
- they'll kill me.
- Come on, we're lucky.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.312
You know, 'cause they're gonna be
out of town, they'll never know.

32:17.336 --> 32:18.616
Dude, you don't know
how to throw

32:18.870 --> 32:20.975
a high school party,
let alone a college party.

32:21.239 --> 32:25.346
What, are you kidding? You remember the
halo pajama jammy jam? It was legendary.

32:25.644 --> 32:26.714
These are college people,

32:27.012 --> 32:28.652
they're not like
normal people, all right?

32:28.914 --> 32:31.656
College girls have expectations.

32:31.917 --> 32:33.863
That's why I have this.

32:34.152 --> 32:35.552
- What's this?
- It's a cheat sheet.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.714
A guide, if you will,
to throwing a college party.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.400
It's blank.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.107
Okay, I haven't had time
to fill it in yet.

32:46.398 --> 32:49.936
So what are some things we're gonna
need to throw a college party?

32:50.235 --> 32:52.374
- I don't know.
- Aw, come on, man. Think about this.

32:52.671 --> 32:53.671
Come on, get-

32:53.739 --> 32:54.982
we've seen a lot of these movies

32:55.006 --> 32:57.043
about you know, parties,
college chicks.

32:57.342 --> 32:58.902
Like what... what do
they have in those,

32:59.177 --> 33:01.097
that we don't have that
we need to put into this?

33:01.213 --> 33:02.419
Beer. Kegs of beer.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.352
Kegs of beer.

33:04.616 --> 33:07.028
See, it's easy.

33:07.285 --> 33:08.285
Good-
kegs of beer... yes!

33:14.059 --> 33:17.302
Shaquille Horowitz,
we need to talk.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.872
I hear you're th rowing a party.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.203
I know you're throwing
a party and I wanna go.

33:22.467 --> 33:24.743
I have to go.
I'm popular. Got it?

33:25.036 --> 33:26.447
I can make it worth your while.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.718
Or I can make it a nightmare.

33:28.974 --> 33:31.113
Your call, loser.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.980
See you tonight, fellas.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.656
So, do you think I wouldn't
ask you again, slutster?

33:41.953 --> 33:43.261
Shaq?

33:43.555 --> 33:44.966
There's not really
anything to tell.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.100
Okay, lie.

33:47.392 --> 33:50.896
Hey, did you guys know that sideshows
having a costume party tonight?

33:51.163 --> 33:52.733
- Sideshow's having a party?
- Yeah.

33:52.998 --> 33:53.998
Wait, our sideshow'?

33:54.266 --> 33:55.939
Like the Shrek-looking
blockhead?

33:56.234 --> 33:57.311
Yeah, that's what Hayden says.

33:57.335 --> 33:58.905
That's can't be right.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.172
'Sup ladies.

34:00.472 --> 34:01.644
Hey, Chelsea.

34:01.940 --> 34:04.420
So what's this
I hear about a party'?

34:04.676 --> 34:06.178
Huh? What?

34:06.478 --> 34:07.838
How does everybody
know about that?

34:08.013 --> 34:10.583
So it's true?

34:10.849 --> 34:12.328
Uh, yeah.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.495
Um, actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

34:14.518 --> 34:17.193
Okay. What did
you want to ask me?

34:17.489 --> 34:20.629
Uh... this is kinda awkward
'cause of this morning.

34:20.926 --> 34:22.428
And all but um,
I was gonna ask you

34:22.694 --> 34:23.831
if maybe you'd, um...

34:24.129 --> 34:26.699
Yes! Yes,
of course I will.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.944
Wow. Wow!

34:29.201 --> 34:30.509
Gee, this is great.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.476
I actually didn't know
how I was gonna get a keg.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.183
I remember that
you and your sister...

34:35.206 --> 34:36.686
You have your sisters ID.

34:36.975 --> 34:39.956
I thought you were gonna say no.

34:40.212 --> 34:44.820
Yeah, of course. You can't
have a party without a keg.

34:45.116 --> 34:46.116
Right?

34:46.184 --> 34:49.722
I know. You can't.

34:50.021 --> 34:52.661
You are so cool.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.402
Yeah, Chelsea, I mean...

34:54.693 --> 34:56.831
You are so cool!

34:57.128 --> 35:01.042
So let us go forth
and get a keg.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.333
- Yeah?
- Let's.

35:02.467 --> 35:05.539
You, me...

35:05.837 --> 35:08.317
So, what are gonna
be for the party tonight?

35:08.573 --> 35:09.711
I don't know.

35:10.008 --> 35:13.888
I'm thinking about being
a slutty German barmaid.

35:14.179 --> 35:15.852
â™ª We wish you
a merry Christmas â™ª

35:16.147 --> 35:17.888
â™ª we wish you
a merry Christmas â™ª

35:18.183 --> 35:23.098
â™ª we wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy new year <i>â™ª</i>

35:30.028 --> 35:31.735
â™ª With tidings we bring... â™ª

35:32.030 --> 35:34.030
- What up, my Rasta brotha?
- I'm not your brother.

35:34.099 --> 35:37.512
And don't be giving me that
island Rasta bullshit, white boy.

35:37.769 --> 35:38.769
Where's the bathroom'?

35:38.904 --> 35:39.904
It's for employees only.

35:40.005 --> 35:41.609
So buy something or leave.

35:41.907 --> 35:44.114
- Hello.
- What do you want?

35:44.409 --> 35:48.186
I would like to purchase
this beef stick,

35:48.446 --> 35:51.052
this energy shot...

35:51.349 --> 35:52.794
I'm working the graveyard shift.

35:53.084 --> 35:54.085
Ah, this...
What is this?

35:54.386 --> 35:56.388
Lemon, lime. Delicious.

35:56.688 --> 35:59.635
Uh, fried pie...

35:59.925 --> 36:04.601
This adorable cupcake, and...

36:04.896 --> 36:07.706
And a keg of beer.

36:09.401 --> 36:12.245
Not-not-
not for me.

36:12.537 --> 36:16.314
It's for my husband.

36:16.608 --> 36:20.146
It's his turn to bring the
beer for the union...

36:20.445 --> 36:21.890
Meeting.

36:22.147 --> 36:23.717
Uh, yeah.
The union.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.394
Uh, local steelworker 896.

36:26.651 --> 36:28.631
Uh, got a lot of meetings.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.059
Lot of negotiations,
big vote coming up.

36:31.323 --> 36:32.323
Yeah...

36:32.557 --> 36:33.801
You know, there's
talk of strike.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.270
- Yeah...
- You know, uh...

36:35.560 --> 36:36.760
Jimmy Hoffa's actually talking

36:36.828 --> 36:38.398
about making big changes,

36:38.663 --> 36:40.663
but I don't think it's gonna
set well with the mob-

36:40.799 --> 36:42.176
you know, honey,
we shouldn't-

36:42.467 --> 36:44.174
we shouldn't bore
this poor gentleman

36:44.469 --> 36:47.609
with your boring union talk.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.283
- Okay.
- Yeah.

36:49.574 --> 36:52.282
It'll be $63.50.

36:52.577 --> 36:55.319
Great, you wanna get this one...

36:55.614 --> 36:56.614
Honey?

36:56.848 --> 36:59.158
- I do.
- Sweetie, sweetie bear.

36:59.451 --> 37:00.930
With my wallet.

37:01.186 --> 37:03.029
- And the money.
- Yeah.

37:03.321 --> 37:05.699
- For the keg of beer we are purchasing.
- Yep.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.304
At the tone,
please record your message.

37:10.595 --> 37:12.836
- - Hey cock
wizard, it's Brett again.

37:13.131 --> 37:14.667
You remember me, right?

37:14.966 --> 37:18.140
The head of the
scholarship committee.

37:18.436 --> 37:20.507
Yeah, you know, where your
whole futures riding on?

37:20.805 --> 37:22.614
Yeah. Yeah, me again.
Don't fuck it up.

37:25.844 --> 37:28.654
So, uh, I think we made
a pretty good team in there.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.267
Well, I know three
very hot chicks

37:30.348 --> 37:32.487
that are going
to a wicked costume party.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.229
Yeah...
Um, about that.

37:34.519 --> 37:35.725
What about that'?

37:36.021 --> 37:38.023
Well, it's not really
my party per Se. So...

37:38.323 --> 37:40.030
Yeah, whatever, dickwad.
We're coming.

37:40.325 --> 37:42.134
Yeah, I'm gonna be
a slutty German barmaid.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.340
Dude, I gotta piss.

37:44.629 --> 37:46.404
Now?

37:46.698 --> 37:48.507
Classy...

38:03.748 --> 38:05.523
Well, you see,

38:05.817 --> 38:07.592
it's a funny thing.

38:07.886 --> 38:10.366
I have all six ID's,

38:10.655 --> 38:14.034
but there only seems
to be five of you.

38:14.325 --> 38:18.865
Now why do you suppose
that would be?

38:19.164 --> 38:21.371
Perhaps, because the only ID

38:21.666 --> 38:24.579
belonging to anyone
over 21 years of age

38:24.869 --> 38:25.574
isn't here.

38:25.870 --> 38:26.870
We're really sorry.

38:27.038 --> 38:30.611
Shut your mouth,
Mr. Manson.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.582
Don't think I'm not
onto your little cult.

38:32.877 --> 38:34.255
You think you're gonna
have a crime spree

38:34.279 --> 38:35.589
in my neighborhood
and get away with it?

38:35.613 --> 38:37.923
- Crime spree'?
- Well, let's see...

38:38.216 --> 38:40.628
Well, we got one act
of indecent exposure,

38:40.919 --> 38:42.728
coupled with vandalism.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.968
And since Mr. Motomol said you
referred to him as an island brother.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.793
Which I can only surmise

38:48.093 --> 38:50.767
is a slur against his ethnicity,

38:51.062 --> 38:53.372
that makes it a hate crime.

38:53.631 --> 38:55.133
One count of fraud,

38:55.433 --> 38:56.776
one count of
presenting a false ID

38:57.068 --> 38:58.877
in an attempt to commit a crime.

38:59.137 --> 39:00.707
Various vehicle
violations that I'm sure

39:00.972 --> 39:02.110
by the looks of that heap.

39:02.407 --> 39:04.614
As well as the Mann act
for you, Mr. Manson.

39:04.909 --> 39:05.909
Mann act?

39:06.077 --> 39:07.715
Get your hands on your head.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.220
I'm right behind you, boy.

39:10.482 --> 39:13.395
I got my hand on my gun.

39:13.651 --> 39:14.994
The Mann act.

39:15.286 --> 39:18.096
Whoever knowingly transports
any woman or girl

39:18.389 --> 39:19.467
for the purpose of debauchery,

39:19.491 --> 39:21.402
or any other immoral purpose.

39:21.659 --> 39:23.137
I hope you hadn't
had anything planned

39:23.161 --> 39:27.632
for the next 25 years.

39:27.932 --> 39:29.138
- Hey, dad.
- Oh, hey, baby.

39:29.434 --> 39:32.847
How are you?

39:33.138 --> 39:34.415
What did these guys do?

39:34.439 --> 39:35.599
Well, they tried to buy beer.

39:35.640 --> 39:39.520
The fat one exposed himself.

39:39.811 --> 39:42.087
Hey, look with your head-
hey, look ahead!

39:42.347 --> 39:44.327
He's a little smurf.

39:53.792 --> 39:57.262
Well, Van Horn says
your good people.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.440
So I'm gonna cut you a break.

39:59.697 --> 40:01.836
But I have to confiscate
the beer though.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.113
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

40:04.369 --> 40:08.442
You know, you should try to be
more like Van Horn over there.

40:08.706 --> 40:10.811
He's a goddamn inspiration.

40:15.146 --> 40:18.150
Hey, I just wanna say thanks for
helping us with the cop back there.

40:18.449 --> 40:19.723
Fuck you, man.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.361
I did it for the party.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.792
I still think
you're a faggot.

41:05.530 --> 41:08.130
- Can you believe... -i can't believe
we're not in jail right now.

41:08.399 --> 41:11.539
Or we didn't have a serious
accident with a nightstick.

41:13.605 --> 41:14.777
Hold it, one second.

41:15.073 --> 41:16.108
Um, hey, brew.

41:16.407 --> 41:17.112
It's Brett'.

41:17.408 --> 41:18.408
Uh...

41:18.443 --> 41:19.854
Hey, sticky buns.
Yeah...

41:20.111 --> 41:21.784
Hey, you got a band
lined up. Right?

41:22.080 --> 41:25.254
Of course I have a band
lined up for the party.

41:25.550 --> 41:26.961
Mm, I hope so.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.095
I hate to see that
scholarship get taken away.

41:29.387 --> 41:31.594
Okay. Um...

41:31.890 --> 41:33.170
All right, see you tonight, bud.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.431
Uh, deuces to you, as well.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.571
Okay...
Oh, he hung up.

41:38.863 --> 41:39.864
I know a great band.

41:40.131 --> 41:41.131
Oh, do you?

41:41.266 --> 41:42.409
The only band you need to know

41:42.433 --> 41:44.640
is the Brei I penis band, okay?

41:49.641 --> 41:51.712
Um...

41:51.976 --> 41:53.956
Chelsea, I have a really
huge favor to ask you.

41:54.245 --> 41:56.623
Okay, dude,
I forgive for everything.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.475
Of course the bitchin'
daisies will play

41:58.583 --> 42:00.654
for your party tonight.
I love you.

42:00.952 --> 42:03.091
I mean...
Like- I...

42:03.388 --> 42:05.595
The thing is,
I love your band...

42:05.890 --> 42:08.302
The bitchin' daisies
are awesome.

42:08.593 --> 42:11.631
But...

42:11.930 --> 42:14.774
Brett really wants
Dane's band to play.

42:17.468 --> 42:18.469
So...

42:18.770 --> 42:19.942
Oh...

42:20.238 --> 42:22.275
Yeah...

42:22.573 --> 42:24.917
You know, we're not really ready
to play a gig yet, anyway.

42:25.176 --> 42:28.282
I was just... I was just
trying to help you out.

42:28.579 --> 42:30.957
You were...

42:31.249 --> 42:33.695
Dane! Dead hooker surprise.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.623
Dane. Yeah.

42:35.920 --> 42:39.129
You know, I don't know that
they would play a house party.

42:39.424 --> 42:40.630
I was thinking that

42:40.925 --> 42:43.303
but I figured
since you're his cousin.

42:43.594 --> 42:46.268
You'd talk to him.
Talk him into it.

42:46.531 --> 42:47.531
Sure.

42:47.598 --> 42:48.668
I could do that.

42:48.967 --> 42:50.969
It would mean a lot to me.

42:51.269 --> 42:52.612
No problem,

42:52.870 --> 42:54.510
I mean that's what
friends are for, right?

42:54.539 --> 42:57.349
Well... wow.
Yes.

42:57.642 --> 42:59.212
Um, you're the best.
You know that.

42:59.510 --> 43:03.617
And um, you know, I'm like
your band's biggest fan.

43:03.881 --> 43:05.690
- I think so.
- Really?

43:05.984 --> 43:10.023
Cool, 'cause I'm pretty sure
you've never like heard us play.

43:10.321 --> 43:11.698
Funny how that worked out.

43:11.990 --> 43:14.300
Okay. All right.

43:39.817 --> 43:43.094
Chelsea, this is your sister.

43:43.388 --> 43:44.833
We need to talk.

44:03.341 --> 44:05.218
Sorry, folks, I don't
handle novelty acts.

44:05.510 --> 44:06.614
Uh, what'?

44:06.911 --> 44:08.720
The whole eclectic
nerd thing has passed

44:09.013 --> 44:11.289
kids want mopey, sad,
vampire, "twilight" stuff.

44:11.582 --> 44:13.220
I- were not
actually in a band.

44:13.518 --> 44:14.758
We're here about a band.

44:15.053 --> 44:16.930
Oh, really? Well, I
like the sound of that.

44:17.221 --> 44:18.393
What's it for?

44:18.689 --> 44:20.362
A huge party.
Tons of hot college chicks.

44:20.625 --> 44:23.367
Yeah? Yeah?
What band are you looking for?

44:23.628 --> 44:24.629
Dead hooker surprise.

44:24.929 --> 44:26.306
Ahh.

44:26.597 --> 44:28.873
DHS.
A good choice.

44:29.133 --> 44:30.874
And one of my top acts.

44:31.135 --> 44:32.613
No way they're
doing the party though.

44:32.637 --> 44:33.911
They're way too big for that.

44:34.205 --> 44:36.005
And besides, they're
recording an album, so...

44:36.207 --> 44:37.481
No live performances.

44:37.775 --> 44:40.915
Ahem, um, I didn't
wanna actually say this but...

44:41.212 --> 44:43.283
She's the cousin
of the bass player.

44:43.581 --> 44:46.289
Hey, everyone is someones cousin.
Okay. Skippy?

44:46.584 --> 44:48.655
And bass players
are temporary at best.

44:48.953 --> 44:50.330
Hardly part of the band at all.

44:52.090 --> 44:53.867
Now perhaps you'd prefer
one of my other bands.

44:53.891 --> 44:55.393
How about pants on to the beast?

44:55.660 --> 44:58.903
Uh, baby bat-fer, nigga please,
dead bed, Lance Boyle,

44:59.163 --> 45:00.441
and one
of my personal favorites,

45:00.465 --> 45:01.637
ass gasket.

45:01.933 --> 45:03.573
Well, we really need
dead hooker surprise.

45:03.601 --> 45:05.239
We kinda promised
that we could get them.

45:09.841 --> 45:12.151
Ah! That was really
stupid, wasn't it?

45:12.443 --> 45:13.443
Dumb.

45:13.511 --> 45:14.854
- Hey, Chelsea.
- Dane.

45:15.146 --> 45:16.352
Hey, what are you doing here?

45:16.647 --> 45:17.955
Hey, Dane, how's it going?

45:18.249 --> 45:20.169
Hey, I love that new sound
you come up with, man.

45:20.251 --> 45:21.251
Great stuff.

45:21.452 --> 45:22.760
I haven't seen you forever.

45:23.020 --> 45:24.020
How are Sage and Rebecca?

45:24.155 --> 45:25.600
They're great.
Were great.

45:25.857 --> 45:27.577
- Becca still keeping you in line?
- Trying.

45:27.825 --> 45:29.636
Nice. Hey, anything you
need, just let me know.

45:29.660 --> 45:32.140
Well, actually,
that's why were here.

45:32.430 --> 45:33.510
I was kinda hoping you guys

45:33.631 --> 45:34.991
could play a party
for me, tonight.

45:35.099 --> 45:37.136
Crazy, huh?

45:37.435 --> 45:39.675
I told them you're way too big
for that sort of nonsense.

45:39.804 --> 45:40.804
It's really important,

45:41.038 --> 45:42.540
it would help me
out of a major bind.

45:42.840 --> 45:44.979
- Tonight?
- Yeah, sorry it's such short notice.

45:45.276 --> 45:46.653
Really.

45:46.944 --> 45:48.822
You know what? We were
supposed to do rehearsal.

45:48.846 --> 45:50.624
But I'll just tell the
other guys we have a gig.

45:50.648 --> 45:52.821
Really? Thank you,
that is so awesome.

45:53.117 --> 45:54.391
Sow of a bitch.

45:57.889 --> 45:59.698
Hey, I heard the lambda omegas

45:59.991 --> 46:02.336
have bikini models in these baby
pools full of whipped cream.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.998
Lambda omegas are gay.

46:04.295 --> 46:05.865
Now that's just
what I'm talking about

46:06.164 --> 46:07.336
you know why they're gay?

46:07.632 --> 46:08.632
Why?

46:08.699 --> 46:10.872
'Cause they have no originality.

46:11.169 --> 46:12.512
We're gonna use...

46:12.803 --> 46:13.803
Jell-o.

46:13.871 --> 46:14.871
Jell-o?

46:15.006 --> 46:16.679
Yeah. Jell-o.

46:16.974 --> 46:19.648
He's got brains.

46:19.911 --> 46:21.390
That's gross.

46:21.679 --> 46:23.659
Did I tell you to stop?

46:27.852 --> 46:29.763
I...

46:30.054 --> 46:31.260
I really owe you one.

46:31.556 --> 46:32.556
Yeah, you do.

46:32.723 --> 46:35.932
- I'm gonna go.
- I'm gonna go.

46:44.101 --> 46:45.774
Hey, sha-queer.
Yeah, it's Brei l.

46:46.070 --> 46:47.674
Word is you're fucking up, okay?

46:47.939 --> 46:49.350
Get the beer,
stop fucking around.

46:49.607 --> 46:51.348
I don't wanna have to tell gates

46:51.609 --> 46:53.887
that you're bitch ass can't
fucking man up and get the beer.

46:53.911 --> 46:55.948
So call me back with some
good news, all right'?

46:56.247 --> 46:58.022
Is it supposed to be this soft?

47:06.691 --> 47:09.433
Fuck the Diaz brothers,
I'll bury...

47:09.727 --> 47:11.468
What the fuck?
What are you two doing here?

47:11.762 --> 47:13.162
You know this is
my relaxation time.

47:13.364 --> 47:14.484
I know, sorry to bother you.

47:14.599 --> 47:15.805
But this is really important.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.807
How could you
bring him here again?

47:18.102 --> 47:19.142
You know he creeps me out.

47:19.403 --> 47:20.541
We're not here to buy drugs.

47:20.805 --> 47:21.909
So...

47:22.206 --> 47:24.243
Drugs?

47:29.447 --> 47:32.121
Why would you even say that?

47:39.090 --> 47:42.435
That's it.
Lose your clothes.

47:42.727 --> 47:44.400
If you're wearing a wire, I
swear to god-

47:44.662 --> 47:45.662
no no no no no, I'm not.

47:45.896 --> 47:47.176
We're just here
about a beer keg.

47:47.431 --> 47:49.809
We would like some beer keg.

47:52.470 --> 47:54.916
- Kegs of beer?
- Yeah.

47:55.172 --> 47:57.083
- For what?
- Party we're throwing

47:57.341 --> 47:58.341
what kind of party?

47:58.476 --> 47:59.614
Dude, a badass party.

47:59.910 --> 48:03.653
Yes.

48:03.948 --> 48:05.086
There gonna be girls there?

48:05.349 --> 48:06.692
College girls.

48:06.984 --> 48:08.258
Coeds, bro.

48:08.519 --> 48:09.679
Will you come look at my ass.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.025
I think this thong
is giving me a rash.

48:12.323 --> 48:14.132
Or like...
I don't...

48:14.425 --> 48:18.202
Baby, can you not see that I'm
trying to do business over here.

48:18.496 --> 48:21.443
You know, I might be
allergic to your dick.

48:27.538 --> 48:31.145
Just say it.

48:31.442 --> 48:32.819
Okay.

48:33.110 --> 48:35.613
Okay. Yeah.

48:35.880 --> 48:37.291
I'll take care of that.

48:45.222 --> 48:48.169
You hear that?

48:48.459 --> 48:49.619
Oh no, I don't hear anything.

48:49.827 --> 48:51.307
Helicopters, man.
You don't hear that?

48:51.362 --> 48:52.067
I don't hear any-

48:52.363 --> 48:53.808
fucking feds.

48:55.499 --> 48:58.173
Fuck!

48:58.469 --> 49:02.713
They use those silent
military helicopters now.

49:03.007 --> 49:06.819
But I can hear them.

49:07.078 --> 49:08.078
You guys gotta go.

49:08.212 --> 49:09.323
- Yeah, we should go.
- Okay.

49:09.347 --> 49:10.485
Get them outta here.

49:10.748 --> 49:13.490
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm going, I'm going.

49:14.819 --> 49:15.820
Shit.

49:17.588 --> 49:20.660
Okay, okay. Okay.

49:25.196 --> 49:26.834
Uh, rover?

49:27.098 --> 49:28.236
He's kind of a lunatic.

49:28.532 --> 49:30.341
Yeah, but he's buying us
beer though.

49:30.601 --> 49:32.342
We'll see.

49:41.078 --> 49:42.078
You can't be serious.

49:42.279 --> 49:43.587
Oh, what's...
What's this?

49:43.881 --> 49:45.258
What is that? It looks
like a fucking dress.

49:45.282 --> 49:47.193
Dude, it's a slip.

49:47.451 --> 49:48.589
It's Freudian slip.

49:48.886 --> 49:50.729
I've got the terms,
the ego, libido,

49:51.021 --> 49:52.967
some big word...
It's smart.

49:53.257 --> 49:54.793
Oh...

49:55.092 --> 49:56.092
I don't get it.

49:56.193 --> 49:58.195
Um, smart people will get it.

49:58.462 --> 49:59.532
College people.

49:59.797 --> 50:01.299
So you won't have
to worry about it.

50:01.599 --> 50:03.636
Really, though?
A priest?

50:03.934 --> 50:05.811
I mean, who wants
to party with a priest.

50:06.103 --> 50:07.103
What?

50:07.271 --> 50:09.148
Catholic school girls.

50:21.385 --> 50:24.491
Strip club, really?
You took me to a strip club?

50:24.789 --> 50:26.199
What, are we gonna
find a girl willing

50:26.223 --> 50:27.367
to jell-o wrestle
at the mall?

50:27.391 --> 50:28.597
I was hoping that we would.

50:28.893 --> 50:31.339
- I'm... okay, I'm starting to panic.
- Oh, my...

50:31.629 --> 50:32.972
All right, calm down.
Calm down.

50:33.264 --> 50:35.208
We just need to pick up
one of these girls. All right?

50:35.232 --> 50:37.144
Where they... oh, that one
is perfect, right there.

50:37.168 --> 50:38.168
- Right there?
- Yes.

50:38.302 --> 50:39.679
- That's a cop.
- What?

50:39.970 --> 50:42.746
That is a cop. I will not
do time for a stripper.

50:43.007 --> 50:44.452
You know how I feel about time.

50:44.742 --> 50:46.787
I couldn't even get through
the first season of "OZ."

50:46.811 --> 50:48.051
- Okay.
- I will not be Beecher.

50:48.078 --> 50:51.582
Get out of the car.

50:51.849 --> 50:54.022
It's like crazy.

50:54.318 --> 50:56.798
Hi. Excuse me, miss.

50:57.087 --> 50:58.430
What the fuck do you want, huh?

50:58.689 --> 51:01.499
Uh... I was
just wondering...

51:01.792 --> 51:03.999
Are you an employee
of this establishment?

51:04.295 --> 51:05.575
Are you asking
if I'm a stripper?

51:05.763 --> 51:08.175
Are you'?

51:08.466 --> 51:10.810
I'm gonna have
to call you back, okay?

51:11.101 --> 51:13.672
Ahem, look, little freaky boy,

51:13.971 --> 51:15.971
I'm not gonna blow you
and your priest friend here,

51:16.040 --> 51:17.480
okay'? Why don't you
run along, okay?

51:17.641 --> 51:18.779
- That's not...
- No, no.

51:19.043 --> 51:20.784
We were just wondering,
if maybe you know...

51:21.045 --> 51:24.891
- You and... - hey, what the
fuck, man, ls some on here?

51:25.182 --> 51:26.183
Nothing, man, is...

51:26.484 --> 51:27.804
Were you going
to blow these guys?

51:28.052 --> 51:30.293
- No... no, no, no.
Santos, por favor.

51:30.554 --> 51:33.660
Don't start, okay? Don't
start your shit! Huh?

51:33.958 --> 51:35.699
Are these your regulars, huh?

51:35.993 --> 51:37.995
Is this the guy
you've been texting?

51:38.295 --> 51:39.575
- No, no texting
