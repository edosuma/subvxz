09:26.666 --> 09:28.434
- Done.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.603
- We did it.

09:30.670 --> 09:31.871
- So what do you think?

09:31.938 --> 09:33.172
Did everything go according
to plan?

09:33.239 --> 09:36.142
- Designed it in my laboratory,
and it worked.

09:39.545 --> 09:40.846
- Well...

09:40.913 --> 09:42.982
- The tattoo that Jimmy pulled
out today

09:43.049 --> 09:45.384
is a very cool tattoo,
but that's an apple.

09:45.451 --> 09:46.652
- That's an apple.

09:46.719 --> 09:49.689
- My honest thought is that he
was afraid

09:49.755 --> 09:50.990
of making it look
like a butt,

09:51.057 --> 09:53.225
so he didn't putt
the little peach crease.

09:53.292 --> 09:56.262
- But he has really clean line
work in that tattoo.

09:56.329 --> 09:59.598
The tattoo that Brittany did
missed the one biggest thing

09:59.665 --> 10:04.170
that she needed for that
tattoo to actually be good.

10:04.236 --> 10:08.407
- There's just no black. That
thing is not gonna hold up.

10:08.474 --> 10:10.543
- I love the shape of the wind
bars.

10:10.609 --> 10:12.845
I think it gives it a
little bit more movement,

10:12.912 --> 10:15.381
but damn it,
give me that black.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.950
- You know what's crazy about
Clay's tattoo?

10:18.017 --> 10:22.021
<i>There's a lot of brilliance</i>
<i>in the simplicity of it.</i>

10:22.088 --> 10:24.256
- He started with beautiful
line work.

10:24.323 --> 10:27.593
The black contrasted against
the colors of the peach

10:27.660 --> 10:30.629
makes the peach pop up out
of the skin.

10:30.696 --> 10:34.567
- You can see the years of
experience in that tattoo.

10:34.633 --> 10:35.901
- We're just gonna have to
figure out

10:35.968 --> 10:38.104
who's edging out
a little further ahead.

10:40.272 --> 10:43.376
- I did a quarter sleeve
in two hours.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.878
- It's not about how much space
you can cover in two hours;

10:45.945 --> 10:47.013
it's about what's good and
what works,

10:47.079 --> 10:48.581
and you know what
to look for...

10:48.647 --> 10:51.083
- And holds up. I have issues
with both you guys' tattoos.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.586
- Seems like we have some
pretty mixed opinions

10:53.652 --> 10:54.820
on what happened today.

10:54.887 --> 10:56.589
- I thought Jimmy's was a
trendy mess

10:56.655 --> 10:59.392
of whimsical, sloppy lines.

10:59.458 --> 11:04.263
- Or you could say that it was
a very trendy, popular, cool...

11:04.330 --> 11:05.631
- I like timeless, not trendy.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.099
- Yeah--

11:07.166 --> 11:08.501
- Yeah, it's creative to be a
timeless tattoo

11:12.471 --> 11:15.041
- But after 20 years, why
aren't you paving the way?

11:15.107 --> 11:16.509
- It's not about reinventing
the wheel.

11:16.575 --> 11:18.144
It's about doing a badass
version

11:18.210 --> 11:19.378
of whatever you're doing.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.047

because we have

11:21.113 --> 11:23.215
a completely old-school
mentality,

11:23.282 --> 11:24.784
and a more new-school
mentality

11:24.850 --> 11:27.286
as far as styles are concerned.

11:27.353 --> 11:31.090
We can't necessarily judge
things on our taste.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.594

That's it. No more tattooing.

brutal now.

Nice. Clay's tattoo has some
issues.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.103
I'm surprised.
I thought it would be perfect.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.771

20:42.274 --> 20:44.343
<i>tattoo in this competition.</i>

20:46.878 --> 20:48.680
- All right, Jimmy.
Tell us about your tattoo.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.149
- Today, I tried to really
focus on all the nuts and bolts

20:51.216 --> 20:53.151
that make a good American
traditional tattoo.

20:53.218 --> 20:54.720
- I was a little nervous
in the very beginning

20:54.786 --> 20:56.288
for you, honestly.
- Me too.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.724
- Your line weight is perfect,

20:58.790 --> 21:01.526
but what's a little confusing
is what those sails are doing.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.762
If the wind is pushing it a
certain way,

21:03.829 --> 21:08.133
both ends of the sail are going
to have parallel curves to it,

21:08.200 --> 21:11.637
not one going one direction
and then one going the other.

21:11.703 --> 21:13.438
- But there are a lot of things
about this tattoo

21:13.505 --> 21:15.507
that are
done beautifully.

21:15.574 --> 21:17.809
At the top of the ship where
the wood is,

21:17.876 --> 21:22.047
you deliberately left a
negative strip of skin tone

21:22.114 --> 21:25.417
so the color doesn't go all the
way up to the outline.

21:25.484 --> 21:28.186
That technique is a very
prevalent trick

21:28.253 --> 21:29.788
in American traditional.

21:29.855 --> 21:32.024
- Well, this tattoo's good,
but I want to see how it

21:32.090 --> 21:33.125
stacks up next to Clay's.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.296
- All right, Clay.
From all the way back here,

21:38.363 --> 21:41.400
I could literally see the
texture of the pepper shading.

21:41.466 --> 21:45.871
- I [bleep] love
the pepper shading so much.

21:45.937 --> 21:48.974
- I love the sensation
of pepper shading.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.509
Rrrt! Rrrt!

21:50.575 --> 21:53.078
- It's funny, because you and
Jimmy are almost opposite

21:53.145 --> 21:54.579
in a lot of different things,
right?

21:54.646 --> 21:55.881
I wish that pepper shading

21:55.947 --> 21:57.249
were in this tattoo
over here...

21:57.315 --> 21:58.483
- Right. I understand. Yeah.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.619
- But where he has used that,

22:00.686 --> 22:03.922
he really made it a point to
leave negative space

22:03.989 --> 22:06.692
in between the line work and
the colors.

22:06.758 --> 22:09.861
In your ship, right around the
two little red windows,

22:09.928 --> 22:12.264
the brown isn't shaded
perfectly

22:12.330 --> 22:15.734
all the way up to that line,
but it's not purposeful.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.803
It looks more like a holiday
than a negative space

22:17.869 --> 22:19.671
that was left there
for a reason.

22:19.738 --> 22:21.406
- Running out of time,
'cause I saw it,

22:21.473 --> 22:22.908
and I was trying to get to it.

22:22.974 --> 22:25.510
- I mean, overall, though,
if there was anybody looking

22:25.577 --> 22:26.712
at this tattoo,
they would say,

22:26.778 --> 22:29.381
"That is a [bleep]
gorgeous tattoo,"

22:29.448 --> 22:31.883
or at least I'm saying it,
'cause I like that thing.

22:31.950 --> 22:34.886
- Mm-hmm. You guys both
pulled out all the stops today.

- Can you tell me
about what happened?

29:15.086 --> 29:18.990
- My niece, she gave one
of her friends a place to stay,

29:19.057 --> 29:23.595
and her friend brought another
young lady to the house.

29:23.661 --> 29:27.465
She started bringing all
kind of guns and men and things

29:27.532 --> 29:30.101
like that, and so my niece
told them they had to go,

29:30.168 --> 29:34.706
and one of the girls did
call the guys over there,

29:34.772 --> 29:39.010
and one of the guys said,
"Well, what you want me to do?

29:39.077 --> 29:40.578
Shoot up the house?"

29:40.645 --> 29:45.517
So they went back over there

29:45.583 --> 29:49.020
and killed my niece, nephew.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.224
- That's a lot.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.161
I think you're really brave
for coming here today.

29:56.227 --> 29:57.929
- Yeah.

29:57.996 --> 30:00.598
- I'm gonna try and be brave and
do something...

30:00.665 --> 30:02.033
something really great for you.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.768
- They're, like,
in a better place now.

30:03.835 --> 30:05.970
- So it's a celebration
of life.

30:06.037 --> 30:08.773
- No more pain
and suffering and worries.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.542
They're free.

30:13.411 --> 30:14.579
- This is Rashad.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.813
He loved basketball.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.982
- He looks like
such an awesome guy.

30:18.049 --> 30:20.385
- He was at a friend's house--

30:20.451 --> 30:22.153
I never met this girl,

30:22.220 --> 30:24.055
so I know it wasn't that
serious--

30:24.122 --> 30:27.458
and her and her ex was kind of
texting each other

30:27.525 --> 30:29.994
back and forth, and I guess she
was trying to make him jealous

30:30.061 --> 30:33.565
to tell him that my brother
was there to see her.

30:33.631 --> 30:38.002
He somehow showed up and walked
up to my brother's car,

30:38.069 --> 30:41.940
opened the door, and shot him
in the back of the head.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.275

I'm doing this for him.

30:50.181 --> 30:52.517

- Oh, my God.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.319

and make sure that this

30:54.385 --> 30:58.022

and life and heaven.

30:58.089 --> 30:59.324
