11:14.875 --> 11:17.375
You know, I see homeless people
on the street and I wonder,

11:17.375 --> 11:19.917
how does something like that happen?
And you know why?

11:19.917 --> 11:21.917
They know my mom.

11:21.917 --> 11:25.583
- I know it hurts.
- Why didn't I just go to that conference?

11:26.041 --> 11:29.875
- I would have that money and a tote.
- You would have loved my seminar.

from that table?

I'm a smart and creative woman,

for me to raise that money on my own.

just gives me leverage to get what I want.
