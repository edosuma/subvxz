07:38.425 --> 07:40.661
<b>Luan wants me to</b>
<b>try out this pie.</b>

07:40.761 --> 07:43.630
<b>- Hey, Mr. McB, wanna help</b>
<b>me with my volcano?</b>

07:43.730 --> 07:45.599
<b>- Absolutely--uh, just give</b>
<b>me five minutes</b>

07:45.699 --> 07:47.835
<b>while I help Lola with</b>
<b>her double pageant wings.</b>

07:47.935 --> 07:49.536
<b>- [heavy sigh]</b>
<b>- [pie splats]</b>

07:49.636 --> 07:52.239
<b>- So, that's what she meant</b>
<b>by "try out this pie."</b>

07:52.339 --> 07:53.640
<b>Give me five more</b>
<b>minutes, Lincoln.</b>

07:53.740 --> 07:56.076
<b>Gotta get this meringue</b>
<b>out of my eye.</b>

07:56.109 --> 07:58.245
<b>- Where's Lori? Jam with Luna.</b>
<b>Find Lily.</b>

07:58.345 --> 07:59.379
<b>- There we go.</b>

07:59.479 --> 08:01.181
<b>Now who was it that</b>
<b>needed my help?</b>

08:01.281 --> 08:03.283
<b>- [explosion]</b>
<b>- Lisa!</b>

08:05.619 --> 08:06.854
<b>- This stinks, Clyde.</b>

08:07.020 --> 08:08.055
<b>I finally get</b>
<b>some attention</b>

08:08.155 --> 08:10.924
<b>and my sisters come</b>
<b>over here and hog it.</b>

08:11.024 --> 08:12.125
<b>They all gotta go.</b>

08:12.226 --> 08:13.293
<b>- I totally agree--</b>

08:13.393 --> 08:14.595
<b>except for Lori.</b>

08:14.695 --> 08:16.063
<b>I'm studying all</b>
<b>her quiz answers</b>

08:16.163 --> 08:18.265
<b>and if I change</b>
<b>everything about myself,</b>

08:18.365 --> 08:20.067
<b>we'll be soulmates.</b>

08:20.167 --> 08:22.202
<b>- You know, if you</b>
<b>wanna impress Lori,</b>

08:22.302 --> 08:23.704
<b>you can just talk to her.</b>

08:23.804 --> 08:26.139
<b>- Yes, talk to her.</b>
<b>That's a valid--</b>

08:26.240 --> 08:27.808
<b>[groans, head clunks]</b>

08:28.876 --> 08:31.411
<b>- I've had just about</b>
<b>enough of this.</b>

08:31.512 --> 08:33.580
<b>Now listen up!</b>
<b>- [object shatters]</b>

08:33.679 --> 08:36.183
<b>- I guess I picked the wrong</b>
<b>day to stop shouting.</b>

08:36.283 --> 08:38.184
<b>I said--</b>
<b>- Thank you, Lincoln.</b>

08:38.284 --> 08:39.486
<b>I got it!</b>

08:39.586 --> 08:41.087
<b>I am going to dominate</b>

08:41.188 --> 08:43.423
<b>the Little Miss</b>
<b>Ambidextrous Pageant.</b>

08:43.524 --> 08:44.825
<b>- You're the best, Lincoln.</b>

08:44.925 --> 08:47.394
<b>Clyde's dads really helped</b>
<b>with my makeup.</b>

08:47.494 --> 08:49.630
<b>Now if I can just</b>
<b>find my bedroom.</b>

08:49.730 --> 08:51.565
<b>Nope, that's Lisa's room.</b>

08:51.665 --> 08:53.066
<b>- Lincoln,</b>
<b>did you know Mr. McBride</b>

08:53.133 --> 08:55.636
<b>put himself through theater</b>
<b>school working as a plumber?</b>

08:55.736 --> 08:59.206
<b>He spent a whole hour</b>
<b>teaching me about flush valves.</b>

08:59.306 --> 09:01.108
<b>- Wow, maybe I had it wrong.</b>

09:01.208 --> 09:03.577
<b>My sisters aren't trying</b>
<b>to hog Clyde's dads.</b>

09:03.677 --> 09:06.513
<b>They just want</b>
<b>a little attention, too,</b>

09:06.613 --> 09:08.282
<b>and you know what?</b>

09:08.382 --> 09:09.816
<b>I'm gonna let them have it.</b>

09:09.917 --> 09:13.820
<b>But not this leftover meat.</b>
<b>That's coming with me.</b>

09:13.921 --> 09:16.023
<b>Whew!</b>

09:21.061 --> 09:22.596
<b>- MOM: Oh, Lincoln,</b>
<b>there you are.</b>

09:22.696 --> 09:24.731
<b>I got some more materials</b>
<b>for your volcano.</b>

09:24.831 --> 09:27.100
<b>- DAD: And I made my special</b>
<b>marinara sauce for lava.</b>

09:27.201 --> 09:28.502
<b>- Wow, thanks!</b>

09:28.602 --> 09:30.103
<b>You guys remembered</b>
<b>my volcano.</b>

09:30.204 --> 09:32.573
<b>- DAD: Of course, we did.</b>
<b>We always planned to help.</b>

09:32.673 --> 09:34.041
<b>We just needed to</b>
<b>find some time.</b>

09:34.141 --> 09:36.410
<b>- MOM: We're sorry it</b>
<b>took so long, honey.</b>

09:36.510 --> 09:38.278
<b>Did you do something</b>
<b>to your sideburns?</b>

09:38.378 --> 09:39.746
<b>- [car brakes screeching,</b>
<b>car doors slamming]</b>

09:39.847 --> 09:41.615
<b>[car tires squealing]</b>

09:42.749 --> 09:45.319
<b>- We broke Clyde's dads.</b>
<b>- MOM: You did what?</b>

09:45.419 --> 09:46.486
<b>- We were having a great time,</b>

09:46.587 --> 09:48.255
<b>when all of a sudden,</b>
<b>they just snapped,</b>

09:48.355 --> 09:50.757
<b>herded us into their car,</b>
<b>and drove us home.</b>

09:50.858 --> 09:53.060
<b>- I have no idea what</b>
<b>precipitated this.</b>

09:53.093 --> 09:55.495
<b>I simply suggested</b>
<b>a sleepover.</b>

09:55.596 --> 09:57.798
<b>- Not everyone can</b>
<b>handle 11 kids</b>

09:57.898 --> 09:59.233
<b>like Mom and Dad can.</b>

09:59.333 --> 10:03.770
<b>- Hey, Dad, what did you</b>
<b>think of my future bride--Lori?</b>

10:03.871 --> 10:05.372
<b>- Which one was she?</b>

10:05.472 --> 10:07.074
<b>There were so many.</b>
<b>[shuddering]</b>

10:07.174 --> 10:10.811
<b>- I'm sorry. Frozen dinners</b>
<b>were all I could manage.</b>

10:10.911 --> 10:14.081
<b>- Dad, I think</b>
<b>you forgot to--</b>

10:14.181 --> 10:16.083
<b>- HOWARD &amp; HAROLD: [snoring]</b>
<b>- [shuddering]</b>

10:16.183 --> 10:19.319
<b>- I guess I really</b>
<b>underestimated my parents.</b>

10:19.419 --> 10:20.687
<b>Even if it takes a while,</b>

10:20.787 --> 10:24.591
<b>they eventually find time</b>
<b>for all of us--every day.</b>

10:24.691 --> 10:26.560
<b>No wonder Dad has</b>
<b>a wicked canker.</b>

10:26.660 --> 10:28.629
<b>- GIRLS: [chattering]</b>

10:28.729 --> 10:30.831
<b>- MOM &amp; DAD:</b>
<b>Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hold it!</b>

10:30.931 --> 10:33.267
<b>Five minutes, girls.</b>
<b>We're helping Lincoln now.</b>

10:35.502 --> 10:36.537
<b>- It's finished!</b>

10:36.637 --> 10:39.273
<b>Ahem, drum roll, please.</b>

10:40.641 --> 10:42.376
<b>Three...two...</b>

10:42.476 --> 10:44.077
<b>...one!</b>
<b>- [marinara sauce splats]</b>
