00:01.268 --> 00:03.702
Oleg, the people at Table Two

00:03.704 --> 00:05.337
want to know
what's in the veggie burger.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.672
No. They don't.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.012
Eh. That's fine.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.246
They wanted refills,
so I'm probably not

00:14.248 --> 00:16.048
gonna go back there anyway.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.416
Where's Max?

00:17.418 --> 00:18.784
This plate has been
here so long,

00:18.786 --> 00:22.721
the salmon is turning into
Salmonella.

00:22.723 --> 00:27.359
She took a break
with the new dishwasher.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.661
Max, I thought you slipped out
the back.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.097
He did for a minute,
but I popped him back in.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.372
This just in,
work is so much more fun

00:40.374 --> 00:43.208
when you're sleeping
with a co-worker.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.077
Max, that was good.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.746
It was five Hail Marys good.

00:47.748 --> 00:52.117
I think we made
these dishes dirtier.

00:52.119 --> 00:57.256
Max, he's cute, but how can you
even stay hard with that accent?

00:57.258 --> 01:01.627
"Come here, Max.
I wanna hump ya a wee bit".

01:04.198 --> 01:05.764
What can I say,
I always had a thing

01:05.766 --> 01:09.501
for the guy on the box
of Lucky Charms.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.517
Hey, everybody.

01:27.521 --> 01:31.156
Look, I got me a Fitbit.

01:31.158 --> 01:35.394
13, 14, 15...

01:35.396 --> 01:38.664
Only 200,000 more steps
before I get a bit more fit

01:38.666 --> 01:40.666
for my wedding.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.267
That's impressive.

01:42.269 --> 01:47.339
I couldn't even make it
through 12 steps.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.340
Hey, Max.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.509
How's my maid of honor?

01:50.511 --> 01:51.844
Hey, Caroline.

01:51.846 --> 01:56.815
How's my run-of-the-mill
wedding guest?

01:56.817 --> 01:59.618
I'm doing great.
Did that sound convincing?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.253
'Cause I've been practicing
it in the bathroom mirror

02:01.255 --> 02:03.388
for an hour every morning.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.190
I know, I've got to stop
sitting on the toilet

02:05.192 --> 02:07.559
while you do that.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.462
Max, let's talk
bridesmaid dresses.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.331
I don't care,
I'll wear anything.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.734
I wore a Greyhound Bus driver's
uniform to my prom.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.604
I was coming
straight from work.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.473
Well, I have decided to wear

02:21.475 --> 02:24.176
Grandma Kuchenski's
wedding gown.

02:24.178 --> 02:27.379
Yeah, all of the women
in my family wore it.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.448
Everyone except
aunts Svetti and Letti,

02:29.450 --> 02:34.286
'cause, well, they're attached
at the abdomen.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.521
There she is.

02:35.523 --> 02:40.159
The hot sauce
for my Huevos Mancheros.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.265
Hey, Sophie, baby,
I got you what you want.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.501
Oleg, no one wants Hepatitis.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.671
It's official.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.474
Our wedding's gonna be
in<i> The Times.</i>

02:55.476 --> 02:58.243
Oleg, how are you gonna be
in<i> The Times?</i>

02:58.245 --> 02:59.645
<i>The Times</i> tends to be picky

02:59.647 --> 03:02.714
and you tend to be more
"picky your nose."

03:02.716 --> 03:07.252
You know, my second wedding
made<i> The Times.</i>

03:07.254 --> 03:12.424
'Cause my first wife showed up
and shot me in the leg.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.193
[phone dings]

03:14.195 --> 03:16.628
That's Vlanka, my sister.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.964
She's my other bridesmaid.

03:18.966 --> 03:22.768
Yeah, we're not that close,
but I feel bad for her

03:22.770 --> 03:25.771
'cause she's one of those adults
with freckles.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.910
Max, you're going to be
in<i> The Times!</i>

03:31.912 --> 03:35.814
In<i> The</i> Times, wearing God knows
what Sophie will pick.

03:35.816 --> 03:40.419
I mean, she has a drawer full
of diamond tiaras for the gym.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.224
Hello, what are you two
talking about?

03:45.226 --> 03:48.460
Deciding which tables to ignore?

03:48.462 --> 03:49.861
We're talking about
Sophie's taste.

03:49.863 --> 03:54.766
Oh, bitch, please.
Come on.

03:54.768 --> 04:00.405
My morning fiber cookie
has better taste than Sophie.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.774
Girls, Vlanka's out.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.544
She has an attitude
and freckles.

04:05.546 --> 04:09.314
Yeah. I mean,
that's too far.

04:09.316 --> 04:12.985
So, Caroline,
congratulations!

04:12.987 --> 04:15.754
You're my new bridesmaid!

04:22.363 --> 04:24.997
Okay, I found a bridesmaid's
dress that I like.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.632
But the only way we can afford
it is if I sell you

04:26.634 --> 04:29.801
to that Armenian guy
on Craigslist.

04:29.803 --> 04:30.969
No way.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.472
I get sick of hummus
after four bites.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.941
Max, we have to
take charge of this.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.709
Because whatever bridesmaid's
dress Sophie picks

04:37.711 --> 04:39.511
is like a Tyler Perry movie.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.814
I don't have to see it
to know it's gonna be awful.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.053
We'll find something
classy, and beautiful,

04:48.055 --> 04:50.355
and just shove it
down her throat.

04:50.357 --> 04:54.693
Who's shoving what down whom?

04:54.695 --> 05:00.299
And if you don't
have a story, I do.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.801
John, Max and I got roped
into being bridesmaids.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.036
Stop.

05:04.038 --> 05:05.470
You had me at rope.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.407
You lost me
at bridesmaids.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.975
I'll be at the hostess stand,
looking at dresses

05:09.977 --> 05:11.910
and silently wishing
for an asteroid

05:11.912 --> 05:13.979
to wipe us off the planet.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.681
If wishes made things happen,
we'd been in the middle

05:15.683 --> 05:18.417
of a zombie apocalypse
right now.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.820
Hey, girls.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.522
My dress just arrived
from Poland

05:23.524 --> 05:25.791
and I'm bustin'
for you to see it.

05:25.793 --> 05:30.329
See it while I eat
one of your $14 puddings.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.364
Sophie, I've been looking
at color choices,

05:32.366 --> 05:35.033
and how would you feel
about us in a nude?

05:35.035 --> 05:40.839
Max could go nude but you don't
have the rack to pull it off.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.574
Does anyone have a knife?

05:46.980 --> 05:48.513
Max, why do you have
a switchblade

05:48.515 --> 05:50.115
to work in a dessert bar?

05:50.117 --> 05:55.354
My mother always told me
to carry protection.

05:55.356 --> 05:58.423
Wait 'til you see
Grandma Kuchenski's dress.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.625
They don't make them
like they used to.

06:00.627 --> 06:04.963
You know, forced
gypsy labor is illegal now.

06:04.965 --> 06:10.135
Here we go.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.870
- Oh.
- Uh...

06:11.872 --> 06:15.874
Sophie, was your grandma
the Crypt Keeper?

06:18.846 --> 06:20.846
What's going on out here?

06:20.848 --> 06:23.115
What's all that white powder
in the air?

06:23.117 --> 06:26.885
I'm trying to run a restaurant,
not an 80's disco.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.588
Oh, put a sock in it.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.591
I'm buying one of your freaking
overpriced puddings.

06:35.763 --> 06:39.965
I'd get mad but I'm mildly
attracted to you right now.

06:39.967 --> 06:43.502
Just mildly?

06:43.504 --> 06:47.506
I mean, now I'm getting mad.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.907
Sorry.
Wedding drama.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.776
Her dress just fell
completely to pieces...

06:50.778 --> 06:54.446
like I'm assuming
I'll do in the near future.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.781
Whatever you need anything
bridal,

06:55.783 --> 06:57.849
go to Rosenfeld's in Brooklyn.

06:57.851 --> 07:02.521
That's where I got my dress
when I was broke and straight.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.423
So you weren't always
into women?

07:04.425 --> 07:06.124
Of course I was.

07:06.126 --> 07:11.897
Except those three years
in Scientology.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.599
Well, it looks like
the three of us

07:14.601 --> 07:16.968
are going to go
dress shopping now.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.671
Yeah. And you know,
I got to go wash my hands

07:19.673 --> 07:22.841
'cause they're covered
in old lady DNA.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.780
Well, that's that.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.449
Shopping with Sophie
is like when I worked

07:30.451 --> 07:32.684
in a Thai massage parlor.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.120
We are going down.

07:39.526 --> 07:41.660
Not if we go before
Sophie

07:41.662 --> 07:44.930
and hide every ugly bridesmaid's
dress that Sophie would like.

07:44.932 --> 07:48.066
If she can't see them,
she can't make us wear them.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.634
How did you come up
with that so fast?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.736
It's the same plan
I used in 2010

07:51.738 --> 07:54.172
when I was a bridesmaid
for Chelsea Clinton.

07:54.174 --> 07:57.142
Bad dress and then her father
followed me into the coat room.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.048
Oh, wow.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.082
Look at this place.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.951
It reminds me of that movie.

08:05.953 --> 08:10.088
-<i> Bridesmaids?</i>
- No,<i> Nightmare on Elm Street.</i>

08:10.090 --> 08:12.257
I don't know what you're worried
about, Caroline.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.125
I think they're
all quite lovely.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.494
Nash, please.

08:15.496 --> 08:19.231
You're a poor person
from Ireland.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.266
I'll ask your opinion when
I need to know where to go

08:21.268 --> 08:25.570
to get free leg braces.

08:25.572 --> 08:26.905
You were right, Max.

08:26.907 --> 08:30.108
She can be
a real "B" sometimes.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.744
I'm sorry, but I don't even know
why he's here.

08:32.746 --> 08:38.717
Bonin' O'Brien here...

08:38.719 --> 08:40.185
is gonna distract
the sales lady

08:40.187 --> 08:43.255
while we hide the ugly dresses.

08:43.257 --> 08:44.990
Hello, ladies.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.959
Same plan.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.661
Who's the lucky bride?

08:49.663 --> 08:54.299
Or should I say,
who's the lucky cradle robber?

08:54.301 --> 08:55.767
Don't mind me.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.569
It's just my crazy sense
of humor.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.538
Oh, the ladies here love it.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.606
The call me "Crazy Carl."

09:01.608 --> 09:05.176
[raspy voice]
"Did you hear
what Crazy Carl said?"

09:05.178 --> 09:07.746
They just love it.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.080
I'm Caroline.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.283
This is Max
and he isn't the groom.

09:11.285 --> 09:12.651
No, no, no.

09:12.653 --> 09:15.587
He's single and gay.
Yes.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.590
So gay, he got kicked out
of One Direction.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.230
Why don't you two walk off
somewhere

09:25.232 --> 09:28.099
and share poignant
coming-out stories.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.035
Go.

09:30.037 --> 09:33.238
- But Max--
- Oh, you heard the women, go.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.673
Can do.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.175
Ladies, look around,
we'll be back...

09:37.177 --> 09:39.144
in about a month.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.812
Tahiti anyone?

09:40.814 --> 09:42.180
I'm just Crazy Carl.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.615
The ladies love it.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.786
Bridesmaid's dresses should be
called what they are.

09:47.788 --> 09:51.323
Really expensive donations
to Goodwill.

09:51.325 --> 09:52.791
Is this one bad?

09:52.793 --> 09:55.160
No. That's a Vera Wang.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.797
But this is a very wrong.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.899
Hide it.

10:00.901 --> 10:05.036
Ew. And it's evil twin.

10:05.038 --> 10:09.040
Oh, I didn't know hazmat suits
came with feathers.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.012
Oh my God.

10:14.014 --> 10:17.082
This the worst thing
I've ever seen.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.150
And I've seen a prostitute
change her tampon

10:19.152 --> 10:21.820
on the sidewalk.

10:21.822 --> 10:25.156
Who are you calling
a prostitute?

10:29.896 --> 10:32.364
This, we've got to hide.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.099
I can't get this dress off.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.667
Just tell it you work at Google

10:35.669 --> 10:37.736
and you're thinking
of settling down.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.971
Lift it up. Lift it up.
Dump it back there.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.773
Stop!

10:41.775 --> 10:45.410
You put
Butterscotch Betty down.

10:45.412 --> 10:48.213
Oh, we were just looking
for a price tag.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.315
I know what's going on here.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.950
You're hiding the good dresses

10:51.952 --> 10:53.685
to make sure no one else
can get them

10:53.687 --> 10:55.987
at our annual half-off
sale tomorrow.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.422
Yeah, that's what we're doing.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.091
We're hiding the good dresses.

11:00.093 --> 11:03.695
In fact, I just caught another
Sneaky Sue.

11:03.697 --> 11:07.265
Oh, I'm Sophie.

11:07.267 --> 11:12.804
Oh, wow, wow, wow.

11:12.806 --> 11:16.808
Oh, look at the color.

11:16.810 --> 11:20.211
That's not color.
That's radiation.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.781
That dress is a one of a kind.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.882
Meaning there's only one?

11:23.884 --> 11:25.850
No, we have two.

11:25.852 --> 11:29.988
And I have two bridesmaids!

11:29.990 --> 11:32.991
I love it when life works out
perfect like this.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.599
[indistinct chatter]

11:40.600 --> 11:43.068
(Public address announcement)
Ladies, our half off sale will
begin in a minute.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.869
Look at this place.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.805
There are more desperate women
crammed in here

11:46.807 --> 11:50.709
than the splash zone
at a Kenny Chesney concert.

11:50.711 --> 11:53.445
I know. It's like Black Friday
at Walmart

11:53.447 --> 11:57.449
And like Black Friday, hopefully
someone will trample me.

11:57.451 --> 12:01.286
Cause thanks to these dresses,
my life is over.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.854
Max, did you hear me?

12:02.856 --> 12:04.823
My life is over.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.291
You said that
when the Chinese food place

12:06.293 --> 12:08.159
forgot the duck sauce.

12:08.161 --> 12:11.229
Well, I'm sorry, but I had
a whole other scenario planned

12:11.231 --> 12:13.031
for my return to<i> The Times.</i>

12:13.033 --> 12:16.201
"Entrepreneur rises
from the ashes."

12:16.203 --> 12:17.736
Now, I'm just going to be
in<i> The Times,</i>

12:17.738 --> 12:20.772
looking like a stupid ash.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.140
Shoot, girl,
just push on through.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.776
I'm pushing, girl.
I am pushing.

12:24.778 --> 12:25.777
(both)
Excuse us.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.312
Excuse us.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.247
Excuse us.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.482
Just go, girl.

12:30.484 --> 12:31.483
I don't want anybody else
to get those

12:31.485 --> 12:34.786
two yellow dresses.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.855
Max, did you hear that?

12:36.857 --> 12:41.993
Someone has worst taste
than Sophie.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.261
Now we just have to
hang back here

12:43.263 --> 12:44.963
and let them get
to those dresses first.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.232
Yay!
My life is good again.

12:47.234 --> 12:52.103
Max, Caroline, up here.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.806
What was that, like, a second?

12:54.808 --> 12:56.841
I saved you a space upfront.

12:56.843 --> 12:59.144
Come on.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.411
Well, it's over.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.113
As soon as they cut
that ribbon,

13:02.115 --> 13:04.082
Sophie's going to
Marshawn Lynch everyone who

13:04.084 --> 13:06.251
gets in the way
of us and those dresses.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.418
There's only one way out
of this.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.020
And you called it earlier.

13:09.022 --> 13:12.090
You have to let them
trample you.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.358
I'm serious.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.294
I'm not about to be trampled
on purpose.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.929
See if you still feel that way

13:17.931 --> 13:19.898
after I say
these next few words:

13:19.900 --> 13:22.433
"Pictured from left,
Caroline Channing."

13:22.435 --> 13:27.071
Try to fend off any heels
you see heading for my eyes.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.506
Attention, ladies.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.075
As you see,
I have the big scissors,

13:31.077 --> 13:33.945
which can only
mean it's time...

13:33.947 --> 13:35.313
to trim some nose hairs!

13:35.315 --> 13:38.316
[laughter]

13:38.318 --> 13:41.986
That Carl is crazy.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.055
The annual bridal sale...

13:44.057 --> 13:46.057
- is now...
- Max, hold my hand.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.058
Open!

13:47.060 --> 13:50.061
[all shouting]

13:52.499 --> 13:55.366
Ladies, ladies,
one at a time.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.169
Oh!

13:58.171 --> 14:00.572
Well, I may be limping down
the aisle,

14:00.574 --> 14:03.408
but at least I won't be limping
in something Swiffer might sell

14:03.410 --> 14:05.844
to dust off ceiling fans.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.046
[woman screaming]

14:08.048 --> 14:10.315
Oh, my God, girl!
here she comes!

14:10.317 --> 14:14.419
Here she comes.

14:14.421 --> 14:15.987
My girl, Rhonda,
had that dress first.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.856
Oh, your girl
is gonna have to

14:17.858 --> 14:20.024
pry it out of my cold,
dead hands.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.326
Hey, Max, Caroline!

14:21.328 --> 14:26.531
Try it on!

14:26.533 --> 14:29.200
Follow me
to the changing room.

14:40.947 --> 14:44.382
(Caroline)
I'm never coming out
in this dress, I'm scared.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.385
(Max)
So on the count of one, two...

14:51.625 --> 14:53.424
Maybe it's not that bad.

14:58.231 --> 15:02.033
(both)
It's bad.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.534
Okay.
So you're telling me,

15:03.536 --> 15:05.503
Versace got murdered,

15:05.505 --> 15:08.640
but no one's taken out
whoever made these?

15:08.642 --> 15:10.541
I know.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.377
I feel like Tweety Bird
is gonna sue us

15:12.379 --> 15:16.147
for copyright infringement.

15:16.149 --> 15:21.219
I feel like we should have giant
toilet paper rolls under here.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.553
Well, maybe
we'll like these better

15:22.555 --> 15:23.621
when we're out of
this bright light.

15:23.623 --> 15:27.458
Max, we are the bright light.

15:27.460 --> 15:32.931
Ladies, you forgot
the matching hats.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.700
There's more?

15:35.702 --> 15:39.470
Oh, if anyone finds a Xanax,
it's mine.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.340
It was knocked out of my hand
by two women duking it out

15:42.342 --> 15:46.411
over a chintz mermaid dress.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.679
Oh, now it looks good.

15:54.721 --> 15:58.723
There's Xanax on the loose
and I'm just standing here?

15:58.725 --> 16:02.226
At least if I was high, I'd have
an excuse to be wearing this.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.395
Here pilly, pilly.

16:04.397 --> 16:08.466
Here pilly, pilly, pilly.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.235
Girl, for real,
you look like straight up crap

16:11.237 --> 16:13.571
in that dress.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.340
For real.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.041
You white girls can't pull
that color off.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.977
That's a waste of poppin'
lemon yellow.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.311
I know.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.447
I am way too white
for this.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.416
She's also too white to say
"turnt up" all the time,

16:25.418 --> 16:28.019
but that hasn't stopped her.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.488
This dress was not my choice.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.756
I hate everything about it.

16:31.758 --> 16:32.991
This is a disaster.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.759
This is "Dressageddon."

16:34.761 --> 16:37.762
Yeah, but in a good way.

16:37.764 --> 16:41.032
You two don't want
to wear the dresses.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.034
You don't have to.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.702
But I thought you wanted us
to match

16:44.704 --> 16:48.773
the balloons
and the ducks.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.242
Max, she said we don't have to
wear the dress.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.410
Don't question her!

16:52.412 --> 16:54.012
That's like questioning
a prison guard

16:54.014 --> 16:57.749
when he says
you're free to go.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.784
Sophie, are you sure
you don't care?

16:59.786 --> 17:03.087
Oh, yeah.
Sure.

17:03.089 --> 17:05.757
Yeah, they're all yours,
Destiny's Child.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.772
This is ten pounds
of ugly junk.

17:20.774 --> 17:24.208
Reminds me of this bartender,
Pete, I used to date.

17:24.210 --> 17:28.079
Come to think of it,
that made me gag, too.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.514
Okay. Done.

17:29.516 --> 17:32.116
[woman crying]

17:32.118 --> 17:35.086
Listen, crying
in a women's dressing room?

17:35.088 --> 17:39.757
Whoever it is, girl,
big butts are in.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.760
[crying continues]

17:42.762 --> 17:44.662
That's Sophie's cry.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.364
I know, 'cause
I hear it through the vent

17:46.366 --> 17:50.468
when she watches<i> Nashville.</i>

17:50.470 --> 17:53.104
Sophie?

17:53.106 --> 17:55.840
(Sophie)
No.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.676
Are you okay?

17:58.678 --> 18:02.713
(Sophie)
It's not me,
but I'm okay.

18:02.715 --> 18:06.384
[sobbing continues]

18:06.386 --> 18:08.853
Sophie, why are
you crying?

18:08.855 --> 18:12.657
When I heard what you said
about the dresses...

18:12.659 --> 18:15.426
It's just--

18:15.428 --> 18:18.496
It's almost, kind of like,

18:18.498 --> 18:21.799
you think I have bad taste
or something.

18:21.801 --> 18:27.171
No.

18:27.173 --> 18:31.142
Caroline thinks
you have great taste.

18:31.144 --> 18:34.378
She does?

18:34.380 --> 18:37.648
Well, then she should say so.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.785
Now.

18:43.456 --> 18:47.625
Well, Sophie, I think you have
your own unique style.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.628
And I think...

18:50.630 --> 18:55.633
that I didn't hear
the words "great" or "taste."

18:55.635 --> 18:57.668
Sophie, what do you even care
what I think?

18:57.670 --> 18:59.170
Just say it!

18:59.172 --> 19:03.474
Sophie, I think
you have great taste.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.445
You do?

19:07.447 --> 19:12.450
[Sophie laughs]

19:12.452 --> 19:15.786
Then, what are we doing
sitting here?

19:15.788 --> 19:18.723
Let's go and get those
dresses back!

19:18.725 --> 19:20.625
Come on.
Help me!

19:25.465 --> 19:28.399
Those other girls
already took them.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.867
What?

19:35.475 --> 19:37.475
Well, at least we don't have to
wear those ugly,

19:37.477 --> 19:40.311
yellow bridesmaid dresses
at the wedding.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.846
Yup.
Now, you only have to wear

19:41.848 --> 19:44.182
ugly, yellow dresses here,
every night.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.517
This is the best thing
that's happened to me

19:46.519 --> 19:48.953
since I realized that weird mole
on my arm was just a Grape-Nut

19:48.955 --> 19:51.522
and not cancer.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.790
Girls, great news.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.425
You stuffed Han
in the microwave

19:54.427 --> 19:56.327
and you're ready
to hit power?

19:56.329 --> 19:57.762
Come on. We've tried.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.231
You know he doesn't fit.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.866
The one thing he's too big for.

20:01.868 --> 20:05.937
No, I got Ilia Jorbich to be
our wedding photographer.

20:05.939 --> 20:08.839
He's the best photographer
at<i> The Warsaw Times.</i>

20:08.841 --> 20:12.443
Well, he's the only one
who still has both arms.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.746
Wait, it's the<i> Warsaw Times?</i>

20:15.748 --> 20:16.847
All this time,
I've been thinking

20:16.849 --> 20:18.716
it was<i> The New York Times.</i>

20:18.718 --> 20:20.518
<i>New York Times?</i>

20:20.520 --> 20:21.919
This is much more exclusive.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.754
You can only get it
in two places.

20:23.756 --> 20:27.825
Poland and the deli in
New Jersey that sells missiles.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.393
This is amazing.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.295
My comeback in
<i>The New York Times</i>

20:31.297 --> 20:32.663
has been preserved.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.899
Max, I'm gonna go ahead
and smile.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.634
My life is good again.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.669
Don't smile yet,
'cause Sophie told me

20:38.671 --> 20:41.005
that because you said
she had such good taste,

20:41.007 --> 20:44.008
she's designing our dresses
herself.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.010
What was that,
like a second?

20:46.012 --> 20:48.746
Yup. You just went
from the best of times

20:48.748 --> 20:50.748
to<i> The Warsaw Times.</i>
