(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

00:06.013 --> 00:07.248
I think it's broken.

00:07.248 --> 00:08.449
It's not broken.

00:08.449 --> 00:09.917
It might be broken.

00:09.917 --> 00:11.486
Do you want it
to be broken?

00:11.486 --> 00:14.188
No.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.890
But, I mean,
if it was broken,

00:15.890 --> 00:17.091
that would be very cool.

00:17.091 --> 00:19.227
I mean,

00:19.227 --> 00:20.595
"man breaks wife's shoulder

00:20.595 --> 00:22.563

lovemaking session"?

00:22.563 --> 00:25.199
(sighs)
This did not happen from sex.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.968
True or false:
we had great sex on Sunday.

00:26.968 --> 00:28.336
That was three days ago.

00:29.537 --> 00:31.038
Aftershocks.

00:31.038 --> 00:33.508
DOCTOR:
<i>What happened, exactly?</i>

00:33.508 --> 00:35.410
I really don't understand it.
I wasn't doing anything.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.478
I wasn't exercising,
I wasn't lifting anything.

00:37.478 --> 00:39.213
It's just so weird.

00:39.213 --> 00:42.150
An injury like this is normal
for someone your age.

00:42.150 --> 00:43.484
My age?

00:43.484 --> 00:46.187
I'm not even 40 yet.

00:46.187 --> 00:47.555
Oh. When do you turn 40?

00:47.555 --> 00:50.091
Tomorrow.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.193
RUSS:
If I may...

00:52.193 --> 00:54.896
isn't it possible
I boned her too hard?

00:57.465 --> 00:59.400
Just, like,
medically speaking?

01:05.473 --> 01:09.844
JESS: <i>Now that you've given her</i>
<i>the gift of a sexual injury,</i>

01:09.844 --> 01:13.114
what could you possibly
get her for her birthday?

01:13.114 --> 01:16.083
Oh, I think we'll just
do dinner with the kids.

01:16.083 --> 01:18.486
You know? Maybe, like,
a cake from Ralphs.

01:18.486 --> 01:20.054
Mm.

01:20.054 --> 01:21.255
Slow down.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.191
A cake from Ralphs? Wow.

01:23.191 --> 01:25.359
We don't make a big deal
out of birthdays.
Well, fine,

01:25.359 --> 01:27.161
but it's her 40th.
You need to bring it.

01:27.161 --> 01:29.564
I did. I did.

01:29.564 --> 01:30.965
Check it out.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.268
Uh-oh. You don't know
what "bringing it" means.

01:34.268 --> 01:35.503
What is this?

01:35.503 --> 01:38.272
Movie tickets
from our first date.

01:38.272 --> 01:40.007
Aw... that's...

01:40.007 --> 01:41.309
cute.
Yeah.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.610
Yeah. Cute isn't a
present though.

01:42.610 --> 01:44.011
Where's the real gift?

01:44.011 --> 01:45.947
Oh, give me a break.

01:45.947 --> 01:48.216
Not everybody needs fancy gifts,
you know?

01:48.216 --> 01:50.518
Like diamonds and... an island.

01:50.518 --> 01:51.919
Framed <i>Sister Act</i>
tickets

01:51.919 --> 01:53.254
or an island are
the only two gifts

01:53.254 --> 01:54.555
you can even think of

01:54.555 --> 01:56.457
for the most important
person in your life?

01:56.457 --> 01:58.059
It feels like
that's all there is.

01:58.059 --> 02:00.061
What's wrong
with you?
A lot.

02:00.061 --> 02:01.262
There's a lot
wrong with me.

02:01.262 --> 02:02.964
It started
at an early age.

02:02.964 --> 02:04.232
Oh, wow.
Here we go.

02:04.232 --> 02:06.000
No, my mother's...
No, tell me.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.869
my mother's 40th...
Mm-hmm.

02:07.869 --> 02:10.171
I took my allowance
and bought her

02:10.171 --> 02:12.206
a pair of earrings
from the drugstore.
Mm-hmm.

02:12.206 --> 02:13.541
And she said to me,

02:13.541 --> 02:15.142
"Oh, sweetie,
I would never wear those."

02:15.142 --> 02:18.479
Lina would totally wear
drugstore earrings.

02:18.479 --> 02:19.881
That's why I love her.

02:19.881 --> 02:21.082
That's nice.

02:21.082 --> 02:22.116
See?

02:22.116 --> 02:23.417
I would murder someone

02:23.417 --> 02:25.086
if they gave me
drugstore earrings.

02:25.086 --> 02:26.220
(chuckles):
Nice.

02:26.220 --> 02:27.321
Yeah.
Literally.

02:29.924 --> 02:30.958

02:30.958 --> 02:32.360
Ow.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.330
Kenny?

02:36.330 --> 02:38.332
Your handwriting
looks weird.

02:38.332 --> 02:40.101
That's rude.

02:40.101 --> 02:42.136
Can't wait till
our real teacher comes back.

02:42.136 --> 02:44.405
That makes two of us.

02:44.405 --> 02:46.874

02:46.874 --> 02:48.876

Hey, there.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.116
You look so professional.
Oh, hi.

I like three.

I hate 12.

03:01.489 --> 03:03.057
At least
you're working.
Yeah.

03:03.057 --> 03:05.059
I haven't had a
real job since 9/11.

03:05.059 --> 03:07.295
Anyway, I saw that
you have a birthday.

03:07.295 --> 03:09.463
It's on Facebook.

03:09.463 --> 03:11.098
That's great.

03:11.098 --> 03:12.433
Um, guess I'm not
invited to the party.

03:12.433 --> 03:14.068
But that's fine.
Oh. We're not...

03:14.068 --> 03:15.903
we're not, um,

03:15.903 --> 03:17.605
No, it's okay. 'Cause
who wants a divorced lady

03:17.605 --> 03:19.440
at their party,
anyway? On the prowl,

03:19.440 --> 03:21.342
sending out her scent?
No, thanks.

03:21.342 --> 03:23.177
You and Jay got divorced?

03:23.177 --> 03:24.378
I kicked him out
a week ago,

03:24.378 --> 03:26.213
but we've been texting.

03:26.213 --> 03:27.915
He's really mean with emojis.

03:27.915 --> 03:31.085
Sometimes it's just, like,
a fist and a skull

03:31.085 --> 03:33.387
and a barrel. What do you
think that barrel means?

03:33.387 --> 03:35.489
Maybe that's where
he's gonna put the body?

03:35.489 --> 03:37.158
Ooh. Maybe.

03:37.158 --> 03:40.461
Yeah. Anyway, um...
enjoy your party.

03:40.461 --> 03:43.598
I'm sure I'll write a comment
about how nice your hair looked.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.334
Stacy, if I was having a party,
you would be invited.

03:46.334 --> 03:48.069
We're friends.

than any of your friends.

03:59.947 --> 04:02.049
That's fair.

04:02.049 --> 04:03.451
I have nothing to wear.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.920
But you said
you didn't want a party.

04:05.920 --> 04:09.056
No. I said that I didn't
want you to throw me a party.

04:09.056 --> 04:10.291

Donna can't babysit, and I still
haven't heard back from Jordan.

08:57.361 --> 08:58.562
Uh, no.

08:58.562 --> 08:59.628
I didn't say anything.

08:59.628 --> 09:01.232
I don't know anything.

09:01.232 --> 09:03.300
You sure?
Yeah, pretty sure.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.236
People talk.

09:05.236 --> 09:07.204
(sighs)

09:07.204 --> 09:08.639
Hey, guys.

09:08.639 --> 09:10.107
You a history buff?

09:10.107 --> 09:11.675
I guess.

09:16.680 --> 09:19.483
General William
Tecumseh Sherman.

09:19.483 --> 09:21.419
Wow.
Yeah.

09:21.419 --> 09:23.254
The Civil War.

09:23.254 --> 09:25.222
Right. Got it.

09:25.222 --> 09:27.691
They're all hand-painted.

09:27.691 --> 09:30.261
It's the only reason my marriage
lasted as long as it did.

09:30.261 --> 09:31.729
Helped me tune out the insanity.

09:31.729 --> 09:33.364
It's like owning a time machine.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.965
I'm there, but I'm not.

09:37.234 --> 09:38.436
Scotch?

09:38.436 --> 09:40.104
Oh.

09:40.104 --> 09:43.374
You know what, I...
I probably shouldn't.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.178
She suddenly started
looking at everything,

09:47.178 --> 09:48.512
like, under a microscope.

09:48.512 --> 09:51.248
"You never do this.
You never do that.

09:51.248 --> 09:52.650
I never loved you."

09:52.650 --> 09:54.385
It's like suddenly
I was under review.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.320
Hmm.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.621
That's what it is.

09:57.621 --> 10:00.324
They turn 40,
and you're under review.

10:00.324 --> 10:02.526
You either get tenure,
or you end up sleeping

10:02.526 --> 10:03.727
in your office.

10:03.727 --> 10:05.162
Huh.

10:05.162 --> 10:07.398
Yeah. Yeah, with Lina it's like,

10:07.398 --> 10:09.266
she used to think
I was really funny.

10:09.266 --> 10:11.068
You know? I used to,
like, crack her up,

10:11.068 --> 10:12.670
like, all the time.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.271
You are funny.

10:14.271 --> 10:16.340
Thanks.

10:16.340 --> 10:17.975
Yeah. I mean,

10:17.975 --> 10:19.643
there's all these cute
girls where I work,

10:19.643 --> 10:21.745
and I crack them up
all the time.

10:21.745 --> 10:24.381
And then I will come home and
say the same thing to Lina,

10:24.381 --> 10:26.117
and she just
rolls her eyes.

10:26.117 --> 10:27.985
She's heard your best material.

10:29.386 --> 10:31.989
I guess I got to work on
some new shit.

10:31.989 --> 10:33.190
Yeah.

10:37.328 --> 10:39.263
LINA:
Hey, is this something

10:39.263 --> 10:41.665
that someone would wear
to a 40th birthday party?

10:41.665 --> 10:43.567
Uh... I don't know.

10:43.567 --> 10:44.969
I've never been to one.

10:44.969 --> 10:47.204
You're lucky.

10:47.204 --> 10:50.541
Oh, my God, this party
I went to last night was insane.

10:50.541 --> 10:52.009
(laughs)

10:52.009 --> 10:53.444
Everybody ended up in the pool.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.546
I think I might have been first.

10:55.546 --> 10:57.448
(laughs) No wonder the
girls love you so much.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.682
You're fun.

10:58.682 --> 11:00.451
Aw, I love them.

11:00.451 --> 11:03.020
Hmm. They think I'm a loser.

11:03.020 --> 11:05.322
Well, you're their mom.
(chuckles)

11:05.322 --> 11:07.291
Ooh, this is a cute one-piece.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.392
Oh, God.

11:08.392 --> 11:10.327
Can you imagine if I wore

11:10.327 --> 11:11.962
something stupid like
that to the party?

11:11.962 --> 11:14.298
I wear stuff like that
all the time.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.333
Well, I don't mean
you're stupid.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.702
I just mean it would be
stupid for me, a mom--

11:18.702 --> 11:22.206
a 40-year-old mom--
you know, to wear that.

11:22.206 --> 11:23.474
Be...

11:23.474 --> 11:26.443
I don't think so.
(chuckles)

11:26.443 --> 11:29.413
I wish I was going to design
school in San Francisco.

11:29.413 --> 11:31.415
You're gonna have so much fun.

11:31.415 --> 11:34.485
Probably fall in love
with a biracial architect.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.354
Have a vegan baby.

11:37.354 --> 11:39.223
You'll see.

11:39.223 --> 11:41.058
Yeah, these are...

11:41.058 --> 11:42.092
Ow.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.627
You okay?

11:43.627 --> 11:46.263
Yeah, it's just my neck.

11:46.263 --> 11:48.199
What happened?
The doctor said

11:48.199 --> 11:51.502
that it was just totally
normal for someone my...

11:53.070 --> 11:54.672
(whispers):
Sex.

11:54.672 --> 11:57.174
It was from sex.

11:57.174 --> 12:00.444
She said it was
called aftershocks.

12:00.444 --> 12:02.479
You know,
'cause of the sex.

12:02.479 --> 12:06.383
Yeah, I think that happened
to my mom once.

12:11.722 --> 12:13.490
What are you doing tonight?

12:13.490 --> 12:15.359
I'm babysitting.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.428
For you?

12:19.597 --> 12:21.265
(clears throat)

12:21.265 --> 12:23.000
Hey.
Hmm?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.101
Happy birthday.

12:24.101 --> 12:27.104
Oh... <i>Sister Act.</i>

12:27.104 --> 12:29.139
The first movie
we ever saw together.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.975
Nope. <i>Eddie.</i>

12:30.975 --> 12:32.977
That's the first movie
we ever saw together.

12:32.977 --> 12:34.511
<i>Eddie?</i> What is <i>Eddie?</i>

12:34.511 --> 12:36.347
The one where Whoopi's
a basketball coach,

12:36.347 --> 12:37.681
not a nun.

12:37.681 --> 12:39.316
So when did we see
<i>Sister Act?</i>

12:39.316 --> 12:41.752
Uh, before we met
each other?

12:41.752 --> 12:43.754
Oh, shit.

12:43.754 --> 12:46.690
I really am blowing this.

12:46.690 --> 12:48.659
Um, I forgot to tell you

12:48.659 --> 12:50.594
that we're using a
new sitter tonight.

12:50.594 --> 12:52.663
Why? What happened
to, um, Jordan?

12:52.663 --> 12:55.432
Oh, Jordan's just
coming to my party.

12:55.432 --> 12:56.500
She's fun.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.735
She jumps in pools.
(scoffs)

12:57.735 --> 12:59.470
Yeah, of course
she jumps into pools.

12:59.470 --> 13:01.038
She's, like, 20.

13:01.038 --> 13:02.740
Age is just a number.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.142
Are you okay?

13:05.142 --> 13:06.977
I'm fine.

13:08.312 --> 13:10.614
Jay thinks I'm under review.
Is that true?

13:10.614 --> 13:13.384
Is our relationship
under review?

13:13.384 --> 13:15.319
What?

13:15.319 --> 13:17.655
When did you talk to Jay?

13:17.655 --> 13:20.491
I don't know. Stacy had me bring
him some boxes for the party.

13:20.491 --> 13:22.726
Why are you getting
involved with the party?

13:22.726 --> 13:24.595
Because I'm the husband.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.530
Remember my 30th?
Forget your 30th.

13:26.530 --> 13:29.199
Okay? Your 40th is
going to rock.

13:29.199 --> 13:30.334
Hmm.

13:30.334 --> 13:31.702
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

13:35.372 --> 13:38.042
Sorry, guys, can you just
give me a few minutes?

13:38.042 --> 13:39.282
Is everything okay?

13:39.282 --> 13:41.223
Party's off!
You know what?

13:41.223 --> 13:43.258
I'm the one who's gonna
say if the party's off!

13:43.258 --> 13:44.993
JAY: Shut up.
STACY: I didn't...

13:44.993 --> 13:46.727
Forget about your 40th.
(Jay and Stacy continue arguing)

13:46.727 --> 13:49.196
50th, now that's gonna rock.

13:56.353 --> 13:57.577
STACY:
<i>Well, he already ruined it.</i>

13:57.577 --> 13:59.569
Just like he ruins everything!

13:59.569 --> 14:01.971
There's got to be a way
to figure this out, right?

14:01.971 --> 14:03.440
Yeah, I'm excited
about my party.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.408
I'm really sorry.
He's on the spectrum.

14:05.408 --> 14:07.210
No, I have no
official diagnosis.

14:07.210 --> 14:08.611
That's just the
menopause talking.

14:08.611 --> 14:10.680
I'm as dry as you make me.
You know what?

14:10.680 --> 14:13.049
I think we're all as dry
as we make each other.

14:13.049 --> 14:15.685
LINA (whispering):
Why did you have to tell him
about the party?

14:15.685 --> 14:17.220
I didn't know it was a secret.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.389
There was scotch.
Oh, this is my 30th

14:19.389 --> 14:21.124
all over again.
It's fine, okay? It's fine.

14:21.124 --> 14:22.659
No, it's not!
You have to fix it.
I got it.

14:22.659 --> 14:24.060
I got it. Jay? Jay?

14:24.060 --> 14:25.128
What is going on here?

14:25.128 --> 14:26.262
This is my house!

14:26.262 --> 14:27.364
I understand that,
okay, but this is

14:27.364 --> 14:28.365
super important to Lina.

14:28.365 --> 14:29.532
Remember?

14:29.532 --> 14:30.734
I'm under review? Tenure?

14:30.734 --> 14:32.669
We talked about that.
I-I... yup.

14:32.669 --> 14:34.437
And I'm not going anywhere until
she gives me Stonewall Jackson.

14:34.437 --> 14:36.406
I don't have
your stupid toy!

14:36.406 --> 14:37.674
What-what toy?

14:37.674 --> 14:39.275
He collects miniatures.

14:39.275 --> 14:40.977
I hand-paint them.
The detail is exquisite.

14:40.977 --> 14:42.212
Thank you.
I will say that.

14:42.212 --> 14:43.213
They're beautifully made.

14:43.213 --> 14:45.715
Spectrum!
Menopause.

14:45.715 --> 14:47.650
Don't you think that any man
that paints little tiny

14:47.650 --> 14:50.086
army men is
on the autism spectrum?

14:50.086 --> 14:52.155
Don't you think that
any woman who hides

14:52.155 --> 14:55.325
exquisitely crafted figurines
is on the menopause spectrum?

14:55.325 --> 14:57.394
RUSS: Okay, well, how about
tonight we're all on the same

14:57.394 --> 14:59.396
spectrum, right? We're on,
like, the party spectrum.

14:59.396 --> 15:01.364
Yeah!
We're in the zone,
we're having fun.

15:01.364 --> 15:02.599
Party spectrum.
We got people
having a good time.

15:02.599 --> 15:04.033
We have...
(Lina gasps)

15:04.033 --> 15:06.069
I didn't take your racist toy!

15:06.069 --> 15:08.004
Okay, will you testify to that
under oath, hand to the Bible?

15:08.004 --> 15:09.439
(blows raspberry)
Didn't think so.

15:09.439 --> 15:11.207
See?
Ugh! I have to take a pill.

15:11.207 --> 15:13.243
Please, you already took one.
I'm gonna have more!

15:13.243 --> 15:14.744
Oh, um...
I'm really sorry
about the party.

15:14.744 --> 15:16.446
No, no, no. Stacy, wait!
Oh, it's no use!

15:16.446 --> 15:18.214
She's already gone, leave her.
Come here, Banjo!

15:18.214 --> 15:19.249
Just... come here.
(Banjo barks)

15:19.249 --> 15:21.017
(gasps)
Banjo, good boy.

15:21.017 --> 15:22.252
I'm gonna take him for a walk.

15:22.252 --> 15:24.087
She probably fed him Stonewall.

15:24.087 --> 15:26.055
I bet that's what happened
to Genghis Khan. Come on.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.757
STACY: I didn't
touch Genghis Khan!

15:27.757 --> 15:29.225
JAY: Yeah, this time
I'm gonna have evidence.

15:29.225 --> 15:31.761
Yeah, go get your hands
real dirty in there.

15:31.761 --> 15:33.129
Spectrum!

15:33.129 --> 15:35.265
Menopause!
(yells)

15:35.265 --> 15:37.500
(door closes)

15:37.500 --> 15:40.703
Well... guess
I'll just call Jordan

15:40.703 --> 15:42.505
and tell her the party's off.
No.

15:42.505 --> 15:44.474
It was stupid
to invite her anyway.

15:44.474 --> 15:47.243
No, no. We can still
pull this off, okay?
No.

15:47.243 --> 15:48.678
Parties are stupid.
We don't have to advertise

15:48.678 --> 15:50.547
our happiness;
we're happy enough.

15:50.547 --> 15:52.348
We are not happy enough.

15:52.348 --> 15:53.583
We are definitely not.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.051
We need more
happiness, okay?

15:55.051 --> 15:56.352
So here's the deal.

15:56.352 --> 15:58.588
I will handle Jay and
get him out of here,

15:58.588 --> 16:00.256
and you clean up Stacy.

16:00.256 --> 16:01.291
It's over, Russ.

16:01.291 --> 16:02.559
It's never over, okay?

16:02.559 --> 16:04.561
We can still do
this. Come on.

16:04.561 --> 16:05.695
Come on.

16:05.695 --> 16:07.764
Stacy?

16:07.764 --> 16:09.632
Come on, buddy, you can do it,
you can do it.

16:09.632 --> 16:11.601
Look, man, I get it.

16:11.601 --> 16:13.403
Like, I know
this is your house, okay?

16:13.403 --> 16:16.306
And you're having issues
with your lady, but...

16:16.306 --> 16:18.541
I could really use
a win tonight, you know?

16:18.541 --> 16:21.010
So... if there's
any way you could...

16:21.010 --> 16:23.680
I don't know, maybe just, like,
take off for a bit or whatever,

16:23.680 --> 16:25.114
like, that would be really cool.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.316
No, I'm not going anywhere

16:26.316 --> 16:27.750
until Banjo does his business.
Fine.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.385
How long does that take?

16:29.385 --> 16:32.055
Stacy sings to him
every time she walks him.

16:32.055 --> 16:33.590
So that's the only
way he'll go now.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.592
She sings to him?

16:35.592 --> 16:38.561
♪ Banjo... ♪

16:38.561 --> 16:43.433
♪ Banjo, time to go, Banjo. ♪

16:43.433 --> 16:46.703
Are you sure that that's
a good idea? 'Cause, um...

16:46.703 --> 16:48.671
Oh, it's not as
many as it seems.

16:48.671 --> 16:51.608
Over time, you build
up an immunity.

16:54.644 --> 16:58.114
BOTH:
♪ Banjo, Banjo ♪

16:58.114 --> 17:01.317
♪ Time to go, Banjo. ♪

17:01.317 --> 17:04.087
Stacy? What are you doing?

17:04.087 --> 17:05.688
Are you okay?

17:05.688 --> 17:09.225
How come I never wear this?

17:09.225 --> 17:10.693
(humming)

17:10.693 --> 17:13.096
(cell phone ringing)

17:13.096 --> 17:14.531
RUSS:
Hey, how's it going?

17:14.531 --> 17:17.267
Things are not good here.

17:17.267 --> 17:19.335
Um... oh, okay!

17:19.335 --> 17:20.737
Hey, good news!

17:20.737 --> 17:22.705
They found the general!
(doorbell rings)

17:22.705 --> 17:25.208
(gasps)
That must be your friends.

17:28.077 --> 17:30.613
Huh.
I guess we're early.

17:30.613 --> 17:32.682
Yeah.
Where is everybody?

17:32.682 --> 17:36.252
Hey, did they, uh, tell
you to bring the cake?

17:36.252 --> 17:38.321
They didn't have to.
It's a backup cake.

17:38.321 --> 17:39.722
Hello?

17:39.722 --> 17:41.624
It's a backup cake?

17:41.624 --> 17:44.394
Just in case I don't get
any of the main cake.

17:44.394 --> 17:47.096
I'm not dating or partying.
Cake is all I have left.

17:47.096 --> 17:48.264
Oh.
STACY:
Hello!

17:48.264 --> 17:50.033
AJ:
Hi.

17:50.033 --> 17:53.136
Did the Evite say
to wear ski attire?

17:53.136 --> 17:54.571
Hey! Hi, hi, hi, guys!
Say something...

17:54.571 --> 17:55.705
AJ:
Oh, there she is!

17:55.705 --> 17:59.342
The birthday girl and, uh...

17:59.342 --> 18:00.710
This is Stacy.
This is my friend.

18:00.710 --> 18:02.278
She's the hostess. (gasps) Hi.
(door opens)

18:02.278 --> 18:05.748
Lina, Lina,
I'm-I'm very excited,

18:05.748 --> 18:08.217
but, uh, but confused.
STACY: Come on in...

18:08.217 --> 18:10.320
Yeah.
...to my extravagant home.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.589
Okay, why don't you guys
just, uh, head into the...

18:12.589 --> 18:14.057
the kitchen?
Right in through...
The bedroom.

18:14.057 --> 18:16.125
No. In through here.
Kitchen.

18:16.125 --> 18:19.262
(indistinct chatter)

18:19.262 --> 18:21.731
Is she gonna be
all right?

18:21.731 --> 18:23.566
Who knows?

18:23.566 --> 18:25.068
What kind of pills
were they exactly?

18:25.068 --> 18:26.436
Oh, they were white ones.

18:26.436 --> 18:28.338
Maybe they were
orange ones.

18:28.338 --> 18:29.372
(gasps)

18:29.372 --> 18:32.241
Maybe it was candy corn.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.243
Who does this?!
LINA: Oh, my God.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.045
No respect
for our country's history.

18:36.045 --> 18:37.981
Is that... dog shit?

18:37.981 --> 18:40.183
His name is Jay.

18:40.183 --> 18:41.985
You should be tried for treason.

18:41.985 --> 18:45.455
You should be tried
for animal... husbandry.

18:45.455 --> 18:47.056
Okay, guys, the
party. Let's...

18:47.056 --> 18:49.225
Why do you care?
You weren't even on the Evite.

18:49.225 --> 18:51.294
He should've thrown
the party himself.
Well, maybe he would've

18:51.294 --> 18:53.630
thrown the party if she laughed
at his jokes once in a while.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.231
This guy is hilarious.

18:55.231 --> 18:57.033
Hey, I laugh
at your jokes, right?

18:57.033 --> 18:58.635
You say, "That's funny."
It's just...

18:58.635 --> 19:00.370
it's not really
the same thing, you know?

19:00.370 --> 19:02.171
JORDAN:
Lina?
Jordan!

19:02.171 --> 19:03.606
Oh.
(chuckles)

19:03.606 --> 19:05.241
Jordan?
Hi, Jordan!
Who's Jordan?

19:05.241 --> 19:07.143
Who isn't Jordan?
The babysitter

19:07.143 --> 19:08.177
that Lina's obsessed with.
I don't care.

19:08.177 --> 19:10.413
Hey! Hey, girl!

19:10.413 --> 19:13.049
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

19:13.049 --> 19:14.517
Let me get you a drink.
We have, um....
Oh...

19:14.517 --> 19:15.652
You know what? Just take mine.

19:15.652 --> 19:17.353
(chuckles)
Gosh, um...

19:17.353 --> 19:20.023
I wish I could, but, uh,
I actually can't stay.

19:20.023 --> 19:21.658
Oh, no.

19:21.658 --> 19:24.060
I-I know.
I had this other thing.

19:24.060 --> 19:28.097
But I really just wanted
to stop by, 'cause, like, wow!

19:28.097 --> 19:29.465
You know, you're 40!

19:29.465 --> 19:31.234
I know.

19:31.234 --> 19:33.970
It's so weird.

19:33.970 --> 19:35.638
(laughs)

19:35.638 --> 19:37.273
So, um...

19:37.273 --> 19:39.008
I'll-I'll talk to you soon?

19:39.008 --> 19:40.209
Yeah.

19:40.209 --> 19:41.444
Totally.

19:41.444 --> 19:43.446
Happy birthday.
Thanks.

19:43.446 --> 19:45.281
It's great.

19:45.281 --> 19:46.616
Bye.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.656
(indistinct chatter)

19:53.656 --> 19:55.758
Hey.

19:55.758 --> 19:56.993
There you are.

19:56.993 --> 19:58.995
What's going on?

20:01.097 --> 20:02.632
We should go.

20:02.632 --> 20:05.101
Why?

20:05.101 --> 20:08.471
All our friends
are old and ugly.

20:08.471 --> 20:10.306
So are we.

20:10.306 --> 20:13.109
No, this is, like, a...
this is a cool party.

20:13.109 --> 20:14.210
Is it?

20:14.210 --> 20:15.244
Yeah.

20:18.414 --> 20:20.083
I mean, it's okay.

20:25.054 --> 20:27.023
It's about to get better.

20:28.257 --> 20:29.492
(whoops)

20:33.029 --> 20:34.230
(laughing)

20:35.431 --> 20:36.466
(laughs)

20:36.466 --> 20:38.401
See? I can still

20:38.401 --> 20:39.669
make you laugh.

20:39.669 --> 20:41.237
How's the water?
It's freezing.

20:41.237 --> 20:42.672
It's so cold.

20:42.672 --> 20:44.607
Oh, my God, it's terrible.

20:44.607 --> 20:46.476
Oh, my God!

20:46.476 --> 20:47.610
It's an awesome party now!

20:47.610 --> 20:49.345
(gasps)

20:49.345 --> 20:51.514
(crowd cheering)
RUSS: Yeah!

20:51.514 --> 20:52.648
It's so freezing!

20:52.648 --> 20:53.750
I know, right?

20:53.750 --> 20:56.219
(laughing)

20:56.219 --> 20:57.653
(grunts)

21:02.325 --> 21:04.160
RUSS:
<i>Not a bad party, right?</i>

21:04.160 --> 21:06.362
It was better than my 30th.
Mm-hmm.

21:06.362 --> 21:07.530
I like to keep the bar low.

21:07.530 --> 21:08.664
That's your move.

21:08.664 --> 21:10.633
(laughs)
I know.

21:10.633 --> 21:14.070
Oh, hey, this is from AJ.

21:14.070 --> 21:15.238
Oh, that's sweet.

21:15.238 --> 21:17.573
Mm-hmm.

21:26.449 --> 21:28.718
I don't understand.

21:28.718 --> 21:33.256
Me neither.
