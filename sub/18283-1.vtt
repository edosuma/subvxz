12:43.096 --> 12:44.562
MELISSA: No.

12:44.564 --> 12:47.832
I just wanted my folks to see
how amazing Evan was.

12:47.834 --> 12:51.202
As a former sax man myself, I
must admit that these boys are

12:51.204 --> 12:52.437
pretty good.
Saxophone?

12:52.439 --> 12:53.838
Were you a professional?

12:53.840 --> 12:57.408
No, no, just me and a bunch
of friends, sort of like Evan.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.779
Melissa told us that Evan intends
to try to make a living at this.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.447
(CHUCKLES)

13:02.449 --> 13:04.182
He makes some car money,

13:04.184 --> 13:05.550
but I don't think he'll
ever make any real money,

13:05.552 --> 13:06.684
if you know what I mean?

13:06.686 --> 13:08.246
Then why is he dropping
out of school?

13:10.390 --> 13:11.630
"Dropping out of school"?

13:12.893 --> 13:14.293
Isn't that what you
said, Melissa?

13:16.163 --> 13:17.228
Um...

13:19.266 --> 13:20.999
Here you go.
Breakfast for champions.

13:22.869 --> 13:23.718
(SNORTS)

13:23.719 --> 13:24.568
Yup, yup.
Good job. You got it.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.770
You can do it.
You know what you're doing.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.372
Here we go.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.741
Yo, Evan, Evan. What's up, man?
How are you doing?

13:29.743 --> 13:31.876
You know Manny, huh? Manny.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.745
Yeah, what's up, man?
I got some good shit.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.814
I don't do coke.
Just say no, all right?

13:38.185 --> 13:40.018
Vinnie, what's up, man?

13:40.020 --> 13:41.386
It's been a while, brother.

13:41.388 --> 13:45.790
Hey, guys, I want you to meet
my good buddy Vinnie Librizzi.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.358
This is Cash and Evan.
What's up, man?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.860
MANNY: This motherfucker is
like a brother to me.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.062
You dudes, you really rock.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.164
Your voice is sweet.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.200
Thank you.
Cash, we got to go.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.267
All right, we're up.
See you guys later, man.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.769
Don't fuck up, man.
Okay, man.

13:57.771 --> 13:59.737
See you, guys. I'll be
out there in a minute.

13:59.739 --> 14:00.705
CLUB OWNER:
All right, all right.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.674
Hey, how we doing tonight?

14:02.676 --> 14:04.409
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

14:04.411 --> 14:06.244
Oh, come on, you can do
better than that!

14:06.246 --> 14:08.246
(LOUD CHEERING)

14:10.116 --> 14:11.449
All right.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.719
You may remember Evan White from
last year at the Drive-in Club.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.522
His band has been tearing it
up in the BR. Please welcome

14:18.124 --> 14:20.024
White Noise.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.693
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

14:22.796 --> 14:25.396
Hey, everybody.
We're happy to be here.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.765
And a little word to the wise,
my dad is in the house so

14:27.767 --> 14:29.434
you better clap after
every song.

14:29.436 --> 14:30.568
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

14:30.570 --> 14:32.490
BOBBY: Five, six,
seven, eight.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.181
ISABEL: You were marvelous.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.650
Yeah, not bad.
Thanks, that means a lot.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.826
So, Dad, any thoughts?

14:49.222 --> 14:50.222
Quitting school?

14:52.792 --> 14:55.126
What?
It's a simple enough question.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.594
Can we talk about this later?

14:56.596 --> 14:59.276
What the hell for? Everyone else
seems to know about it except me.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.668
Yeah, I've decided to leave.
Without telling me?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.670
I was going to tell you, but
I knew you would lose it.

15:05.672 --> 15:06.771
Fucking right I will!

15:08.508 --> 15:10.241
It's my life. Yeah, and as
usual, you're screwing it up.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.876
That's your opinion!

15:11.878 --> 15:13.244
I have to do what
I think is right.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.806
Well, you're not
doing it in my house.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.181
What, you're kicking me out?

15:17.183 --> 15:19.284
Yeah, that's right.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.785
You know the deal. As long as
you're in school, you can stay.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.353
Otherwise you can
pack your bags.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.796
EVAN: If that's
what you want.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.659
Damn straight.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.835
I am so sorry.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.812
Can you wait for me?
I'm going to talk to Evan.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.246
How could you do that?

15:48.248 --> 15:50.248
Sorry, I didn't know you
hadn't told your father.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.118
You didn't want to
check with me first?

15:54.721 --> 15:56.554
Evan, don't blame this on me.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.290
Who am I supposed to blame?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.059
I can't believe you wouldn't
check with me before

16:01.061 --> 16:02.927
mentioning something
like that to him.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.862
I didn't tell him.
It was my father.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.898
Oh, that's even better!
Thanks a lot, Melissa.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.233
Do not put me in between
you and your father.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.235
This is not my problem,
it's yours.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.513
I'm not going to talk to you
if you're acting like this.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.009
Who's asking you to stay?

16:18.011 --> 16:20.171
If I'm such an immature idiot,
why don't you just go?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.767
Oh, Evan.
What's up, man?

16:42.769 --> 16:44.369
Here's my share of
the gas money, dude.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.837
What are you doing?

16:45.839 --> 16:47.071
I am taking care
of a little business.

16:47.073 --> 16:48.313
Come here.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.541
What?

16:50.543 --> 16:51.943
What's up?

16:54.047 --> 16:55.613
Are you selling?

16:55.615 --> 16:57.415
I wouldn't call it
"selling", man.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.384
Just a few joints here
and there, rent money.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.452
You can't be doing that shit.

17:01.454 --> 17:02.754
It's a fucking gig.
What is this, man?

17:02.756 --> 17:04.222
Why are you getting
so righteous, man?

17:04.223 --> 17:06.457
It's not like you don't partake.
I'm giving up everything

17:06.459 --> 17:08.425
for this band. You can't do
anything to fuck it up!

17:08.428 --> 17:10.828
Evan, dude, don't be such an old lady.
What's your problem?

17:10.829 --> 17:12.730
You're stopping now!

17:12.732 --> 17:13.897
Screw you, man. You don't
tell me what to do.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.140
No, but I can kick you
out of the band!

17:17.604 --> 17:20.271
You guys are shit without me.
You're nothing without us!

17:20.272 --> 17:21.372
You don't have
the fucking balls.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.573
Try me!

17:24.676 --> 17:26.676
I'm not fucking
happy about this.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.599
Too fucking bad!
This is bullshit.

(INDISTINCT TALKING)

17:38.058 --> 17:39.457
Frank!

17:39.459 --> 17:41.292
Frank, can I have
a second before we go in?

17:41.294 --> 17:43.061
COLEMAN: No.
I think we can make a deal.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.730
Deal days are over. It's
time to put up or shut up.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.565
Come on, Frank,
it's not too late.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.268
You had your chance last week.
And either you were too

17:50.270 --> 17:53.538
incompetent or ignorant to
take it. That's not my fault.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.706
Now your client gets
to spend another

17:55.708 --> 17:57.442
10 years in jail, thanks to you.

Evan White is a creative
hard-working young man,

18:15.562 --> 18:18.062
who carries a full course
load at LSU

18:18.064 --> 18:19.897
while he pursues his dream

18:19.899 --> 18:22.259
of writing and performing music.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.402
His passion.

18:24.404 --> 18:27.405
But this international
drug dealer allegation

18:27.407 --> 18:29.173
is total nonsense.

18:29.175 --> 18:31.509
This is a Mickey Mouse case

18:31.511 --> 18:35.379
about a young man who found himself
in the wrong place at the wrong time

18:35.381 --> 18:37.014
with the wrong people.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.283
And is now wrongly
accused of crimes

18:39.285 --> 18:42.086
he did not commit.

18:42.088 --> 18:45.089
So I'm asking you, Your Honor,
in the name of sanity

18:45.091 --> 18:47.291
and fairness to allow

18:47.293 --> 18:50.194
Mr. White to be released
on his own recognizance.

made a little change.

Don't blow that
all in one place.

Hey.

You boys are really tight.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.178
And I know it sounds
like bullshit

19:07.180 --> 19:09.614
but there is a manager
from Prime Direction

19:09.616 --> 19:12.136
that I'd like to invite when you
guys play again in two weeks.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.619

us about Prime Direction?

Of course he was, dude.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.674
How's some guy in Lake Charles
going to know anybody?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.476
Guess we'll find out
in two weeks.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.112
Oh, I feel like shit.

19:42.115 --> 19:43.514
Did you do some coke?

19:43.516 --> 19:44.916
Hell, no.

funky ass burrito I had.

You showed her?

No, Evan did.

You did?
That's sick.

23:53.566 --> 23:54.999
(CHUCKLES)
I'm so proud of you.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.567
It's a miracle, huh?

23:56.569 --> 23:58.269
Dinner should be ready
half hour.

23:58.271 --> 23:59.770
Smells good.
Yeah.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.339
Daddy.
Come play with us.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.074
Daddy!
Girls, I got to go change.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.543
BOTH: Daddy!

24:05.545 --> 24:07.945
Play with us! Play with us!
Come on, Daddy!

24:09.549 --> 24:11.415
Okay, you win.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.018
Tea party.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.553
Oh! This looks wonderful.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.955
I cannot resist a tea party.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.089
I love tea parties.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.525
All right, here we go.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.260
Would you like some tea?

24:23.262 --> 24:25.062
Yes, sir.

24:25.064 --> 24:28.232
Would you like some...
Wonderful, wonderful...

24:28.234 --> 24:30.100
EVAN: <i>Just like the snake
in the garden,</i>

24:30.102 --> 24:33.337
<i>he thinks he can fool me,
but he can't.</i>

24:33.339 --> 24:35.806
<i>I know exactly who he is
and what he is capable of.</i>

24:40.179 --> 24:44.014
I have serious doubts about your case
against this young man, Mr. Coleman.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.916
Even if he did sell drugs,

24:45.918 --> 24:48.118
the amount of time that you're
trying to get on this case

24:48.120 --> 24:49.286
is ridiculous.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.356
Twenty-eight years?

24:52.358 --> 24:55.893
Your office is more lenient
with rapists and some killers.

24:55.895 --> 25:00.397
Now unless you can prove that he is a
major player in the Sinaloa cartel,

25:00.399 --> 25:03.100
I advise you and Mr. Levine
to work things out

25:03.102 --> 25:05.062
and not waste any more
government money.

25:06.539 --> 25:08.105
Bail is set at $20,000.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.316
Court is adjourned.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.044
(GAVEL BANGS)

25:16.082 --> 25:17.915
Oh, man!

25:17.917 --> 25:20.237
She just handed you your hat.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.786
Yeah, she's a bleeding
heart liberal.

25:22.788 --> 25:24.588
But she's not gonna
decide the case.

25:24.590 --> 25:25.689
The jury is.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.391
You don't seriously think

25:27.393 --> 25:30.628
my client is a player
in the Sinaloa cartel?

25:30.630 --> 25:32.429
How the hell should I know?

25:32.431 --> 25:35.332
But if he doesn't give me all the
information he has on his supplier

25:35.334 --> 25:36.767
and his contacts,

25:36.769 --> 25:38.836
he's gonna do some serious time.

25:38.838 --> 25:41.238
Look. Don't waste your time.
Let's make a deal.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.541
Three months' probation
for possession.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.409
Stop.

25:45.411 --> 25:46.877
When you're ready
to really talk,

25:46.879 --> 25:48.145
give me a call.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.315
(CHUCKLES)

26:05.164 --> 26:06.597
(BOTH SIGHING)

26:08.034 --> 26:09.333
How could you be so stupid?

26:09.335 --> 26:10.434
You're blaming me?

26:10.436 --> 26:11.569
All I did was smoke some weed.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.837
It's illegal, Evan!

26:13.839 --> 26:16.340
Come on, you smoke.
I've seen you.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.075
Well, I was always
really careful.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.910
So was I. Well, it doesn't
look that way, does it?

26:19.912 --> 26:21.345
This is not my fault!

26:21.347 --> 26:23.747
How was I supposed to know
we were gonna get busted?

26:23.749 --> 26:25.549
Well, then, whose fault is it?

26:25.551 --> 26:27.251
I wanna know whose
fucking fault is it, Evan?

26:27.253 --> 26:28.253
I screwed up.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.021
Is that what you wanna hear?

26:31.023 --> 26:33.324
Once again I failed to live
up to your expectations.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.766
I think you should

26:42.768 --> 26:44.808
stay at home
until this is all over.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.477
All right?

26:47.940 --> 26:49.139
Okay.

26:50.876 --> 26:51.942
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

26:55.181 --> 26:56.480
Why didn't you call me?

26:57.950 --> 26:59.850
I was such a jerk before,

26:59.852 --> 27:01.619
I didn't know
if you were talking to me.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.020
Never do that again.

27:05.524 --> 27:06.924
Okay.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.728
What happened?
You smoked a joint?

27:10.730 --> 27:13.030
This whole thing is
completely crazy.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.313
They're accusing me
of a lot more.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.168
Have you talked
to Bobby or Cash?

27:18.170 --> 27:19.290
I can't.

27:19.705 --> 27:20.945
Judge's orders.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.075
Well,

27:25.077 --> 27:28.078
your dad said
you have a good lawyer.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.780
And I'd let him take care of it.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.858
Manny Stein,
Vincent Librizzi. Who else?

27:41.293 --> 27:42.693
That's it.

27:42.695 --> 27:44.428
Those are the only guys I know.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.790
Well, you better be
sure about that.

27:47.667 --> 27:48.866
I'm sure.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.901
Well, depending on what
you tell me about them

27:50.903 --> 27:52.736
and what they tell me about you,

27:53.272 --> 27:54.438
you're looking at

27:55.207 --> 27:57.107
six years.

27:57.109 --> 28:00.544
Six years? That's a hell of a long
time for a little weed and coke.

28:00.546 --> 28:03.514
Well, considering the amount of
drugs in your client's possession

28:03.516 --> 28:05.516
and the amount of drugs
at the garage,

28:05.518 --> 28:08.218
he's gonna have to cop
to intent to sell.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.187
My client has never admitted
that the drugs were his.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.855
Well, whose were they then?

28:11.857 --> 28:14.692
Evan White rented the motel room,
therefore they are legally his.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.393
That's the same for the
backpack in his garage.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.629
And he's the one with $1500
cash in his possession.

28:18.631 --> 28:20.764
So you're saying Evan White
is the dealer?

28:20.766 --> 28:22.366
No. No... (STAMMERS)
I never said that.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.268
He said that.
Well, I'm asking you now.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.737
I need to talk about this
with my client.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.172
I'll give you five minutes.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.883
I never told you that those
drugs were Evan's, man.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.252
And whose were they then?
What do you mean?

28:42.254 --> 28:43.620
They had to be somebody's.

28:43.622 --> 28:44.855
Coleman is gonna wanna
know whose they are.

28:44.857 --> 28:45.756
If they were yours,
then you're looking at

28:45.758 --> 28:47.024
doing at least
six years in prison.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.776
Is that what you
want me to tell him?

28:48.777 --> 28:50.527
Can we not just tell him
that I refuse to answer?

28:50.529 --> 28:52.830
Then you will be
in deep shit, my friend.

28:52.832 --> 28:55.399
Evan and Bobby have probably
already ratted you out.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.201
Stein and Librizzi will too.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.203
If Coleman thinks
you aren't cooperating,

28:59.205 --> 29:01.405
he can pull the deal and make you
the center of the whole thing,

29:01.407 --> 29:03.447
which mean 25 years or more.

29:04.376 --> 29:05.442
Oh, fuck.

29:06.579 --> 29:08.712
This isn't the time
to be a hero.

29:08.714 --> 29:10.914
This is every man for himself.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.686
I'm dropping the rape charge,

29:15.688 --> 29:18.589
but I'm still prosecuting your
client on the other six counts.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.390
That's ridiculous.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.593
He's the linchpin of
this whole operation.

29:22.595 --> 29:24.628
He didn't do anything.

29:24.630 --> 29:25.996
The evidence says otherwise.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.998
The baggies in your motel room.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.833
The money in your duffel bag.

29:29.835 --> 29:32.236
And not to mention the weed
in the bag in your garage.

29:33.706 --> 29:35.606
I also have three witnesses

29:35.608 --> 29:37.508
that are now willing to testify

29:37.510 --> 29:39.343
that you are the center
of this whole thing.

29:39.345 --> 29:42.112
Three witnesses?
What witnesses?

29:42.114 --> 29:44.915
Manuel Stein, Vincent Librizzi
and William Cash.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.050
They're all lying.

29:47.052 --> 29:50.020
And why am I supposed
to believe you and not them?

29:50.022 --> 29:51.255
Now if you want to come clean

29:51.257 --> 29:53.357
and give me the name
of your supplier

29:53.359 --> 29:55.359
and the other drug dealers
you work with,

29:55.361 --> 29:56.960
well, maybe we can talk.

29:56.962 --> 29:59.396
I'm telling you the truth.
Those are not my drugs.

29:59.398 --> 30:02.399
Drop the Boy Scout
act, Mr. White.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.101
We both know
you are guilty as hell.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.235
I didn't do anything!

30:05.237 --> 30:07.371
You're lying.
You asshole!

30:07.373 --> 30:09.039
Dad.
LEVINE: Harry.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.440
All right, all right, Harry.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.309
Get him out of here.

30:18.384 --> 30:19.624
(DOOR CLOSES)

30:25.391 --> 30:27.231
I'm gonna kill that
motherfucker!

30:29.061 --> 30:31.195
You two just totally
screwed yourselves.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.729
Yeah, well, it's all
his fucking fault.

30:32.731 --> 30:34.898
I'm sorry, but he's trying to put
me in the middle of all this.

30:34.900 --> 30:37.234
If he didn't think you were
guilty before, he does now.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.869
We'll just go to trial.

30:38.871 --> 30:41.205
Evan is completely innocent of
everything Coleman is charging him with.

30:41.207 --> 30:42.339
It's a complete lie.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.242
Going to trial
is our last choice.

30:45.244 --> 30:48.412
You got judges and juries
where anything is possible.

30:48.414 --> 30:51.281
You got mandatory sentencing
where there's no recourse.

30:51.283 --> 30:52.382
So if you get convicted,

30:52.384 --> 30:54.184
you do the time.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.853
Do you have any evidence

30:55.855 --> 30:57.921
that we can use
to implicate him?

30:57.923 --> 30:59.756
I've seen Cash smoke sometimes.

30:59.758 --> 31:01.958
The other two, I don't
even know them.

31:02.795 --> 31:04.428
Bobby will testify for me.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.863
Bobby's your best friend.

31:06.699 --> 31:08.098
This is totally fucked up.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.234
Well...

31:10.236 --> 31:12.369
Give me a couple of days
to look into things.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.505
And then I'll go back and talk
to Coleman again.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.708
But in the meantime,
do me a favor.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.843
If you find yourself
in a situation

31:19.845 --> 31:22.946
where you're gonna lose your temper
with somebody who can destroy you,

31:22.948 --> 31:25.482
stuff it! And that goes
for you too.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.920
Let's go.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.339
Honey, where are you going?

31:49.341 --> 31:51.074
I'm supposed to stop
by Joe and Lynn's.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.843
A donor. I told you
about this.

31:52.845 --> 31:55.412
Tonight? Is that
really necessary?

31:55.414 --> 31:57.381
Yes. It's necessary.

31:57.383 --> 31:58.715
(SIGHS)

31:58.717 --> 31:59.917
Come on.

32:00.753 --> 32:02.352
Listen, I'll make it up to you.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.087
Yeah. Yeah.
You always say that.

32:04.089 --> 32:05.489
No, I promise. I will.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.325
Listen.

32:08.894 --> 32:10.127
I know my life is

32:10.129 --> 32:12.696
really stressful for us
and the kids right now.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.564
Yeah.

32:14.566 --> 32:17.686
I know I don't tell you enough, but I
really appreciate your support here.

32:18.671 --> 32:19.937
Okay.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.306
Thank you.

32:23.008 --> 32:24.107
Love you.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.275
Drive safe.

32:27.246 --> 32:28.486
(CAR LOCK CHIRPS)

32:33.285 --> 32:34.285
(STARTS ENGINE)

32:51.070 --> 32:53.437
I am really sorry about what
happened to those kids.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.738
I mean, they were a really
great band.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.506
But I really can't be involved.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.241
All I want is the truth.

32:58.243 --> 32:59.483
I don't know much.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.212
Did you see any
members of the band

33:02.214 --> 33:03.494
selling drugs that night?

33:03.916 --> 33:05.082
Are you kidding me?

33:05.084 --> 33:06.917
There was 400 people
here that night.

33:06.919 --> 33:08.418
You expect me to know what
any of them were doing?

33:08.420 --> 33:10.420
Are there any employees that
may have seen something?

33:10.422 --> 33:12.122
And even if they saw something,

33:12.124 --> 33:14.424
do you really think they're
gonna come in here and tell?

33:14.426 --> 33:16.526
You told the prosecutor

33:16.528 --> 33:19.796
that you paid my client
$500 for the gig.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.732
He claims it was $1500.

33:21.734 --> 33:23.533
I really can't remember,
but I checked my books

33:23.535 --> 33:24.668
and that's what it said.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.103
Do you have a signed receipt?

33:26.105 --> 33:28.872
I'm running a club, not a bank.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.440
But the band gets 25% a gig

33:30.442 --> 33:32.075
and that is what I gave them.

33:32.077 --> 33:34.211
Well, you just said there were
400 people here that night.

33:34.213 --> 33:37.414
You're telling me the count
was only two grand?

33:37.416 --> 33:39.616
I mean, at 15 bucks a head,
that's more like six.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.952
That is what my book said.

33:41.954 --> 33:44.254
Look, I know you've had
tax problems before,

33:44.256 --> 33:46.723
but this is a kid's life
on the line.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.192
You need to get the fuck out.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.328
You need to get the fuck out
right now.

34:06.612 --> 34:09.012
Hey, what do I have to do
to make you believe me?

34:09.014 --> 34:11.547
You cannot legally
be here right now.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.250
I'm trying to talk to you.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.452
Listen, you're gonna turn
around and leave right now.

signed your release.

take money from Cash.

he had to stop selling.

you knew what was happening?

just implicated himself.

21 years of age,

01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:36.631
Forget it, okay?

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.170
White?

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:00.863
Do we have a son?

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:02.357
Evan.

01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:05.694
When did you get out?

01:06:05.696 --> 01:06:07.062
Answer my question.
When did...

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:08.463
I don't understand
what's happening.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:10.031
Answer my question.

01:06:10.033 --> 01:06:11.099
Yes.

01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:13.268
We have a son.

01:06:14.171 --> 01:06:15.371
You never told me.

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:16.905
I tried.

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:20.075
I came to visit.

01:06:20.077 --> 01:06:21.810
I wrote you letters.
They all came back.

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:26.881
Fuck.

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:27.949
What are you doing here?

01:06:29.419 --> 01:06:31.052
What?

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:32.287
Why have you come?

01:06:33.724 --> 01:06:35.256
I don't know.

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:37.292
That's great, Evan.
That's really great.

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:40.495
After six years, all you have
to say to me is "I don't know"?

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:43.798
I fucked up.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.920
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:06:46.103 --> 01:06:47.202
That's pretty obvious.

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:50.672
Do you want money?

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:51.914
My dad left me some.

01:06:53.877 --> 01:06:55.117
I don't need your money, Evan.

01:06:56.013 --> 01:06:57.093
Are you working?

01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.614
As a nurse.

01:06:59.616 --> 01:07:00.782
What happened to medical school?

01:07:00.784 --> 01:07:02.584
I didn't have the time.

01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:04.386
My dad helped me out
while I went to school.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.859
I'm fucking sorry, okay?

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:13.962
Don't.

01:07:13.964 --> 01:07:16.965
Don't feel sorry for me.
I have a beautiful little boy.

01:07:18.468 --> 01:07:19.801
I like my job.

01:07:20.904 --> 01:07:21.904
I'm happy.

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:27.483
Okay, I gotta go.

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:30.178
Would you like to meet Matt?

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.746
I can't.
I just...

01:07:31.748 --> 01:07:33.868
I just put him to bed.
I can't.

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:35.483
He's asleep.

01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:40.188
For a second?

01:07:43.026 --> 01:07:44.186
Okay.

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:33.908
Thanks.

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:37.278
He's a wonderful boy.

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:40.448
I'm sorry about before.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.817
I didn't mean to scare you.
It's all right.

01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:46.354
I'm glad to know you're okay.

I didn't mean to interrupt.

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.009
It's no problem.

01:09:09.513 --> 01:09:10.612
I'm going to go.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:13.054
Evan, you don't have to leave.

01:09:13.183 --> 01:09:14.782
Just a second, please.

01:09:16.219 --> 01:09:18.019
Evan, wait.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.453
I want to explain.

01:09:19.456 --> 01:09:20.755
You don't have to explain
anything to me.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.122
I met Jay at work.

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:23.390
We've been seeing
each other for two months.

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:24.926
It's not my business.

01:09:38.108 --> 01:09:39.307

01:09:46.216 --> 01:09:47.456

It says here you have
an attitude problem.

01:10:09.039 --> 01:10:10.572
Are you going to say anything?

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:12.006
You didn't ask me a question.

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:14.509
Oh.

01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:16.778
Right, right, right.

01:10:18.949 --> 01:10:20.782
Did I fuck your mother?
What?

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:22.550
I asked you a question.

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:24.219
Did I fuck your mother?

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:25.853
No.

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:28.389
Then you don't have any reason
to treat me like shit, do you?

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:30.024
Listen, you little moron,

01:10:30.026 --> 01:10:32.227
I'm the guy that can put you
back in the joint.

01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:33.861
So unless you're fucking
brain dead,

01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:36.130
I suggest that you act like
you give a damn.

01:10:36.933 --> 01:10:38.032
Okay.

01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:41.402
Now that we're best friends,

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:43.738
let me tell you how this
is going to happen.

get your shit together

so you can fly straight.

01:10:48.178 --> 01:10:50.678
Do you have any friends
or family that can help you?

01:10:52.449 --> 01:10:53.548
No.

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:54.949
That's too bad.

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:57.785
I see here your pops
left you some dough.

01:10:59.122 --> 01:11:01.256
You're lucky.

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:03.791
You're still going
to need to find a job.

01:11:03.793 --> 01:11:06.361
So I want you to report
to me every two weeks,

01:11:06.363 --> 01:11:09.108

you any time I feel like it.

Yes.

Thank you.

01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:11.352
As most of you know,
I grew up in Baton Rouge,

01:13:11.354 --> 01:13:13.421
one of seven children.

01:13:13.423 --> 01:13:15.289
My mother Karen worked as
a waitress and supported

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:18.059
all seven children
on her meager wages.

01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:21.396
I saw my oldest brother
die in a gang shooting,

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:23.598
when I was five years old.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.199
Another brother was incarcerated

01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:26.768
for dealing drugs.

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:28.536
I lived my entire
childhood in fear

01:13:28.538 --> 01:13:30.004
of what might happen next.

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:34.876
Now, many people think
I'm too tough on criminals.

01:13:34.878 --> 01:13:36.744
But it's not the criminals,

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:39.414
it's the innocent victims
that I care about.

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:44.118
And I will do whatever
is necessary

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.953

every young boy or
young girl out there,

01:13:48.358 --> 01:13:50.558

or where they're from,

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.794

but there was a day
after you went to prison that

01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:23.264

Mike Adler,
Federal Probation Office.

01:21:38.794 --> 01:21:40.761
Listen, I need to speak to
Mr. Coleman immediately.

01:21:40.763 --> 01:21:42.363
Well, he just left
a few minutes ago.

01:21:42.365 --> 01:21:43.964
Do you know where to?
This is important.

01:21:43.966 --> 01:21:45.866
No, I don't think he'll be back

01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:47.101
until much later tonight though.

01:21:47.103 --> 01:21:49.203
Okay, can I have his
cell phone number?

01:21:49.205 --> 01:21:51.272
Well, he won't answer it,
he almost never does.

01:21:51.274 --> 01:21:53.707
Okay, fine, I'll just come
back, all right? Thank you.

01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:55.943
Wa... Wait a second.

01:21:59.181 --> 01:22:01.382
Try the Marriott, off the 10.

01:22:01.384 --> 01:22:03.317
He's often there.
Thank you.

01:22:22.772 --> 01:22:24.338
I left the keys in there.

01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:36.817

Hello.

01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:54.335
You can cancel that.

01:22:55.805 --> 01:22:57.705
Yeah, I'll be right up.

01:22:59.008 --> 01:23:00.168
Sorry.

01:23:11.053 --> 01:23:13.093
I believe some libation
is in order.

01:23:13.589 --> 01:23:14.855
Indeed.

You are my lucky charm.
Thank you.

Calm down, son.

01:23:36.879 --> 01:23:38.212
Calm down.
Who is he?

01:23:38.214 --> 01:23:39.913
I don't know.
Okay, you want money? Here.

01:23:39.915 --> 01:23:41.749
No! Get in the bathroom.

01:23:42.118 --> 01:23:43.183
Go.

01:23:45.421 --> 01:23:46.520
And you shut that door!

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:47.955
Do you know who I am?
I know who you are.

Do you know
who I am? Do you?

01:23:50.426 --> 01:23:53.260
I'm somebody you put in jail
for six years, for nothing!

01:23:53.262 --> 01:23:54.561
I'm sorry about that.

01:23:54.563 --> 01:23:56.030
What do you want?
I want you to stop.

01:23:56.032 --> 01:23:57.765
To stop?
Yeah, stop.

01:23:57.767 --> 01:23:59.867
You're going to quit your job, you're
gonna stop running for Attorney General.

01:23:59.869 --> 01:24:02.569
I know all about your
dealings with lawyers,

01:24:02.571 --> 01:24:04.872
for contributions, your secret
talks with the Governor.

01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:06.040
And now I know about this.

01:24:06.042 --> 01:24:07.541
You're finished!
You don't know anything.

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:09.109
Everything I've done
is legitimate.

01:24:09.111 --> 01:24:11.278
I have records! No one
is going to believe you.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:14.348
Listen, you're making
a terrible mistake.

01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:16.917
You just need to turn around
and get out of here.

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.187
Well, then I guess I don't
have a choice.

01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:23.023
Wait... No! No! Please.

01:24:23.025 --> 01:24:24.358

Yes, I do.

You're an evil person!

mistakes, please...

Think about my family.

I'll do anything you want.

01:24:31.033 --> 01:24:32.966
You want me to quit my job,
I'll quit my job.

01:24:32.968 --> 01:24:34.835
I'll drop out of the
race, but...

01:24:36.272 --> 01:24:38.272
Don't do this.

01:24:38.274 --> 01:24:40.174
Please! I beg you!

01:24:40.176 --> 01:24:42.142
I'll do anything you want.

I saw you trailing me and I've
called your probation officer.

01:25:26.021 --> 01:25:27.754
He's coming here. Right now.

You're going to spend
the next 25 years in jail.

01:25:30.392 --> 01:25:32.559

01:26:27.883 --> 01:26:29.116
Finally, you just missed him.

01:26:29.118 --> 01:26:30.918
What happened?

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.353
That motherfucker had
a gun to my head.

01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:34.454
So how did you get away?

01:26:34.456 --> 01:26:36.957
Well, he just dropped the gun
and... And left.

01:26:36.959 --> 01:26:38.091
He just left?

01:26:38.093 --> 01:26:40.294
Didn't you hear what I said?
He just left!

01:26:40.296 --> 01:26:42.763
He's probably still in the
parking lot. Go arrest him!

01:26:45.734 --> 01:26:47.774
I think we should just
let him go.

01:26:48.771 --> 01:26:51.505
What? Are you insane?
He's a murderer.

01:26:51.507 --> 01:26:52.606
Yeah, then why aren't you dead?

01:26:52.608 --> 01:26:54.007
What?
I said,

01:26:54.009 --> 01:26:55.676
if he's a murderer, why
didn't he just shoot you?

01:26:55.678 --> 01:26:56.743
You know, I'm going to go

01:26:56.745 --> 01:26:58.705
arrest him myself.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:26:59.615 --> 01:27:01.782
We're going to let him walk.

01:27:01.784 --> 01:27:02.683
And no one's ever going to know

01:27:02.685 --> 01:27:03.925
what happened in this room.

01:27:11.927 --> 01:27:13.994
or I'll have your ass arrested.

You see, I don't think you
want me to do that.

01:27:23.105 --> 01:27:24.938
I don't think you want
the details of that case

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:27.708
to come out on what really
happened to that kid.
