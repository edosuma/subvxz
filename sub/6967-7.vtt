WEBVTT

00:05.538 --> 00:10.441
Look, Ben, this is what infuriates me.
Don't you see? It's so painfully obvious.

00:10.543 --> 00:12.977
Why do you think our stock's in the toilet?

00:13.046 --> 00:15.810
Because you're cutting research in half.

00:15.915 --> 00:18.440
You've forgotten what the adventure's about.

00:18.551 --> 00:21.850
The industry's changing.
We need to make some hard choices.

00:21.955 --> 00:26.551
- Save your sound bite for the press!
- Let's not relive the stockholders' meeting.

00:26.626 --> 00:30.062
You're killing me!
You're killing my company!

00:30.163 --> 00:34.031
Eurisko is not your company, Brad.
Not any more.

00:34.134 --> 00:36.864
And you damn well better grow up
and get used to it!

00:38.538 --> 00:40.403
You're gonna regret this.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.947
New paragraph.

00:49.015 --> 00:51.677
As I'm sure everyone
on the board will agree,

00:51.818 --> 00:57.154
Eurisko has to face head-on the realities
of an increasingly competitive world.

00:58.291 --> 01:01.658
Since the unfortunate departure
of Brad Wilczek,

01:01.795 --> 01:07.893
I have made recommendations which I believe
will reposition Eurisko as an industry leader.

01:08.468 --> 01:14.100
At the top of this list is
the immediate termination of the COS project.

01:14.841 --> 01:22.077
Its disastrous performance over the past three
quarters and projected losses well into 1994

01:22.582 --> 01:25.176
leave us no other choice.

Hello? Hello!

02:01.054 --> 02:04.217
At the tone, Eastern Standard Time

02:04.290 --> 02:05.951
will be 7.35pm.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.118
What the hell...?

02:16.903 --> 02:18.734
Damn.

02:45.698 --> 02:47.996
File deleted.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.871
Mulder.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.475
Jerry?

04:09.048 --> 04:12.176
You're Dana Scully, right? Jerry Lamana.

04:12.252 --> 04:16.779
- We worked together in Violent Crimes.
- "Worked together"! We were partners.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.557
That's $8.50, please.

04:20.226 --> 04:23.787
- Jerry, what are you doing here?
- Looking for you. And I'm buying you lunch.

04:23.863 --> 04:26.696
- No, really.
- Look, it's on me.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.461
Here.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.868
- Cause of death was electrocution.
- And it wasn't accidental?

04:34.007 --> 04:38.603
Looks like some kind of elaborate booby trap,
but we don't know a whole lot more.

04:38.678 --> 04:40.873
Engineer just found him 12 hours ago.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.973
- Who's running the investigation?
- Either of you know Nancy Spiller?

04:45.051 --> 04:47.645
The forensics instructor at the Academy!

04:48.454 --> 04:51.685
- We used to call her the Iron Maiden.
- On a good day!

04:51.791 --> 04:54.487
Anyway,
she's putting together the squad and

04:54.594 --> 04:57.222
I took the liberty of mentioning your name.

04:59.899 --> 05:04.268
Look, Jerry, I'd like to help you out,
but we're not on general assignment.

05:05.538 --> 05:06.869
Because of the X-Files?

05:09.442 --> 05:14.846
Look, the truth is I could use a little help on
this. I don't wanna drop the ball on this one.

05:14.914 --> 05:17.075
You won't drop the ball.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.745
Drake wasn'tjust the CEO
of a Fortune 500 company.

05:20.853 --> 05:23.651
He was a good friend
of the Attorney General's.

05:23.723 --> 05:28.092
Another feather in my cap would be nice
cos the one I got is looking mangy.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.652
- Yeah, but, Jerry...
- Look,

05:30.830 --> 05:33.731
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

05:35.468 --> 05:39.734
- How come you went your separate ways?
- I'm a pain in the ass to work with.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.740
- Seriously, Mulder.
- I'm not a pain in the ass?

05:42.842 --> 05:45.174
We had different career goals.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.337
Jerry wanted the fifth floor.

05:47.447 --> 05:50.382
- And you?
- I was gunning for a basement office

05:50.483 --> 05:52.348
with no heat or windows.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.544
Well, I know where you ended up.
What about Jerry?

05:55.655 --> 05:59.182
He ran into a little bad luck in Atlanta
working Hate Crimes.

05:59.292 --> 06:02.750
- What kind of bad luck?
- He misplaced a piece of evidence.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.921
Sent it to the cleaners.

06:05.064 --> 06:08.898
By the time he got it back, a federal judge
had lost both hands and an eye.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.410
- 29?
- Uh-huh.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.512
- Going up.
- Must be for the visually impaired.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.484
How about that?
A politically correct elevator.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.611
Third floor.

06:29.355 --> 06:31.220
Fourth floor.

06:31.691 --> 06:34.626
- You OK?
- Yeah.

06:35.094 --> 06:37.153
What was that?

06:44.604 --> 06:46.504
- Yes?
- Hello?

06:46.572 --> 06:49.632
- Security. Who's this?
- This is Agent Dana Scully.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.768
- Do you have a problem?
- Fifth floor. Sixth floor.

06:53.513 --> 06:55.777
Actually, I think everything's OK.

06:55.848 --> 06:59.511
Ninth floor. Tenth floor. Eleventh floor.

07:09.662 --> 07:12.563
See here?
Someone has tampered with the servo.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.192
They switched the ground to the negative,

07:15.268 --> 07:19.170
- so when he put the key in the lock...
- He completed the circuit.

07:19.238 --> 07:22.969
It's fused.
It takes a lot ofjuice to melt a steel key.

07:23.042 --> 07:26.205
And to throw a 180-pound man ten feet.

07:26.813 --> 07:30.249
The servo switch -
could it have been moved manually?

07:30.349 --> 07:33.341
We didn't find any prints
in the surrounding area.

07:33.419 --> 07:39.016
Sure. It could have been switched manually,
but whoever did it had to override the COS.

07:39.158 --> 07:41.592
- What's the COS?
- The Central Operating System.

07:41.661 --> 07:42.958
It runs the building.

07:43.663 --> 07:48.032
It regulates everything from energy output
to the volume of water in each toilet flush.

07:48.167 --> 07:52.365
This is Claude Peterson, a building
systems engineer. He found the body.

07:52.438 --> 07:55.407
If you wanted to override the COS,
what would they...?

07:55.475 --> 08:00.606
First you'd have to break the access codes,
which... well, let's say it wouldn't be easy.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.843
We'll need a list
of the people with that know-how.

08:03.916 --> 08:06.885
I can tell you right now, it'll be a short list.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.285
- Would you be on it?
- Me?!

08:10.389 --> 08:14.291
Hey, look, I'm just a glorified building super.

08:14.393 --> 08:18.261
All I do is monitor the system,
make sure it's functioning properly,

08:18.331 --> 08:21.391
like when I saw the overload
in Mr Drake's office.

08:21.467 --> 08:24.834
What about the phone lines?
Does the COS monitor all calls?

08:25.505 --> 08:28.941
- Yes, it does. Why?
- I'm just wondering.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.868
OK. Look, can I go now?

08:36.515 --> 08:38.746
Why'd you ask him about the phones?

08:39.719 --> 08:41.812
Phone's off the hook.

08:44.924 --> 08:50.692
Maybe Drake was talking to somebody right
before he did his Ben Franklin impersonation.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.457
Taught him everything he knows.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.368
Come in.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.537
It's past three.

09:05.645 --> 09:08.739
I'm just looking for my profile notes.

09:09.749 --> 09:12.047
Maybe if you cleaned your desk
more than once a year.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.643
They were right here. I'm telling you.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.684
We're late.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.961
There are a couple of elements
for us to consider.

09:32.605 --> 09:36.268
Both the statistical rarity
of homicidal electrocution

09:36.342 --> 09:41.336
and the complexity of the crime
indicate a certain devious premeditation.

09:42.148 --> 09:45.709
After all, there are much simpler ways
of killing someone.

09:48.721 --> 09:53.886
All of which leads me to believe that our guy
was some kind of sociopathic game player,

09:53.960 --> 09:55.825
maybe even a recluse,

09:55.928 --> 09:59.159
since he designed a trap,
not only to avoid detection,

09:59.298 --> 10:01.892
but to avoid contact with the victim.

10:03.736 --> 10:05.226
Is that your profile?

10:06.038 --> 10:07.232
Forget it. No.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.707
Drake's final phone call supports this theory.

10:11.577 --> 10:16.105
At the tone,
Eastern Standard Time will be 7.35pm.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.343
Drake's estimated time of death.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.611
Why would Drake call for the correct time
just before he died?

10:21.721 --> 10:23.780
It was an incoming call

10:23.856 --> 10:26.654
from somewhere
in the Eurisko building itself.

10:26.759 --> 10:30.593
Whoever set the trap
wanted to make sure that Drake took the bait.

10:32.598 --> 10:36.125
- Excellent work, Agent Lamana.
- Thank you.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.274
Jerry, what the hell are you doing?

10:46.379 --> 10:49.815
- Hey, don't get all bent out of shape.
- That was my profile.

10:49.882 --> 10:52.350
Look, I didn't think you'd mind.

10:54.987 --> 10:58.150
Anyway, they were just notes.
I filled in the blanks.

10:58.224 --> 11:01.660
Jerry, you went into my office
and you stole my work.

11:01.761 --> 11:06.460
Look, you're on this case cos I asked you
to help me out, and you helped me out.

11:06.565 --> 11:08.624
What is the big deal?

11:14.073 --> 11:18.373
- What did he say?
- He apologized... in his own way.

11:20.012 --> 11:23.971
I just got off the phone with Peterson,
the systems engineer.

11:24.050 --> 11:26.245
One name! Brad Wilczek?

11:26.385 --> 11:28.444
He said it would be a short list.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.183
And it's headline news
how much he despised Drake.

11:31.257 --> 11:35.717
That just seems too obvious. To kill Drake
would be so brazenly egomaniacal.

11:35.828 --> 11:40.197
And fully consistent
with Jerry's excellent behavioral profile.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.628
Fully.

12:05.057 --> 12:10.222
This is what a 220 IQ and a $400-million
severance settlement buys you.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.173
Yes?

12:23.242 --> 12:26.473
Brad Wilczek? We're with the FBI.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.272
What took you guys so long?

12:33.085 --> 12:35.519
Would you mind taking off your shoes?

12:38.457 --> 12:43.918
You can divide the computer science industry
into two types of people: Neat and scruffy.

12:43.996 --> 12:48.660
- Benjamin Drake fit into the first category?
- Neat people like things neat.

12:48.734 --> 12:52.261
They wear nicely pressed suits
and work on surface phenomena.

12:52.371 --> 12:56.899
Things they can understand:
Market shares and third-quarter profits.

12:56.976 --> 13:00.002
And you had a different vision
for the company?

13:00.112 --> 13:04.071
I started Eurisko out of my parents' garage.
I was 22 years old.

13:04.150 --> 13:07.779
I'd just spent a year
following around The Grateful Dead.

13:07.887 --> 13:10.321
You know what Eurisko means?

13:10.422 --> 13:12.515
That's from the Greek, isn't it?

13:14.193 --> 13:15.160
"I learn things".

13:15.227 --> 13:17.821
Not exactly. It means "I discover things".

13:17.930 --> 13:20.626
But Ben Drake wasn't interested in discovery.

13:20.733 --> 13:24.396
He was a short-sighted,
power-hungry opportunist.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.197
Let me show you something. Smart home.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.937
From this prototype I have access
to every square foot of my house.

13:33.012 --> 13:37.779
This place is as safe as Fort Knox
and as energy efficient as your average igloo.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.410
We were two years ahead of Microsoft

13:40.519 --> 13:44.546
when Drake, in his infinite wisdom,
killed the program.

13:44.623 --> 13:47.922
Is this system related to the one
in your corporate building?

13:47.993 --> 13:49.517
Variation on a theme.

13:49.595 --> 13:53.326
How many people know the system
well enough to override it?

13:53.866 --> 13:57.597
Finally the bonus question.
Not many is the answer.

13:58.604 --> 14:01.869
Could someone have hacked
into the system?

14:01.974 --> 14:05.137
Not your average phone freak, that's for sure.

14:05.211 --> 14:10.979
But there's plenty of kooks out there. Data
travelers, electro wizards, techno anarchists.

14:11.050 --> 14:13.143
Anything's possible.

14:13.219 --> 14:18.054
- Could you have done it?
- Of course. I designed the system.

14:19.391 --> 14:21.825
That's why you guys are here, isn't it?

14:21.894 --> 14:23.987
I'm your logical suspect.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.827
You don't seem too worried.

14:26.899 --> 14:29.493
It's a puzzle, Ms Scully.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.765
And scruffy minds like me like puzzles.

14:32.838 --> 14:37.969
We enjoy walking down unpredictable
avenues of thought, turning new corners.

14:38.043 --> 14:42.309
But as a general rule
scruffy minds don't commit murder.

14:48.520 --> 14:52.217
Some see genius
as the ability to connect the unconnected.

14:52.291 --> 14:56.694
To make juxtapositions.
To see relationships where others cannot.

14:56.795 --> 14:59.059
Is Brad Wilczek a genius?

14:59.198 --> 15:01.257
I don't know.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.426
But I do know this for certain.

15:03.535 --> 15:06.504
He has a predilection
for elaborate game playing

15:06.605 --> 15:08.903
and knowledge of the Eurisko building.

15:09.008 --> 15:12.944
And he has a demonstrable motive
for killing Benjamin Drake.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.605
The question remains.

15:16.215 --> 15:19.116
But if he's so clever, how do we nail him?

15:20.653 --> 15:24.214
End of fiield journal, October 24th 1993.

16:15.941 --> 16:18.000
File opened.

16:25.684 --> 16:28.380
From the outset,
I knew Eurisko would expand effectively,

16:28.487 --> 16:32.981
not by traditional Western structures,
but by employing certain Zen beliefs

16:33.092 --> 16:35.390
and other Eastern philosophies.

16:37.363 --> 16:39.729
And other Eastern philosophies.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.759
Eastern philosophies.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.196
Eastern...

16:52.611 --> 16:54.704
Would you give me a second?

16:59.852 --> 17:02.252
Look, I'm here with my hat in my hand.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.221
I screwed up. I'm sorry. What more can I say?

17:05.324 --> 17:09.657
All you had to do was ask.
I would have helped you with the profile.

17:10.963 --> 17:14.057
- You don't know what it's like.
- What what's like?

17:14.165 --> 17:15.827
You heard about Atlanta?

17:15.934 --> 17:20.962
They got me on six months' probation. I gotta
file daily reports like some cherry-new agent.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.770
That was bad luck.
Could have happened to anybody.

17:24.943 --> 17:27.036
Not to you.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.342
Don't run yourself down. You're a good agent.

17:32.184 --> 17:35.847
- We did some good work together.
- Let's face it, I was tagging along.

17:35.954 --> 17:38.149
- That's not how it was.
- How would you know?

17:38.223 --> 17:41.420
You were too busy dazzling them
up there on the high wire.

17:41.493 --> 17:43.393
Mulder.

17:43.462 --> 17:45.555
Take a look.

17:51.770 --> 17:55.570
We borrowed this from
the voice biometrics lab at Georgetown.

17:55.674 --> 18:00.771
It's a computer spectrogram capable of
identifying individual speech patterns.

18:00.846 --> 18:06.409
This is the recording the COS made of the
phone call Drake received just before he died.

18:08.887 --> 18:12.914
At the tone,
Eastern Standard Time will be 7.35pm.

18:14.426 --> 18:19.989
This we put together from a series of lectures
Wilczek gave at the Smithsonian last year.

18:21.467 --> 18:25.836
At the tone,
Eastern Standard Time will be 7.35pm.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.665
Now we'll stack them.

18:30.876 --> 18:35.677
At the tone,
Eastern Standard Time will be 7.35pm.

18:36.315 --> 18:40.911
- You saying this is the same person?
- I'm saying both voices are Brad Wilczek's.

18:41.019 --> 18:46.150
He may have disguised his voice, but not the
formants unique to his own speech patterns.

18:46.258 --> 18:49.318
Which means that
he was the one that killed Drake.

18:49.428 --> 18:52.022
He had the motive and the means.

18:52.097 --> 18:54.861
And now we have the physical evidence.

18:58.337 --> 19:02.865
Judge Benson lives in Washington Heights.
I can get a warrant in less than an hour.

19:02.941 --> 19:05.239
Someone must make sure Wilczek stays put.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.871
- I'll go with you.
- No, I'm gonna bring him in alone.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.574
I need this one, Mulder.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.183
All right.

19:27.733 --> 19:30.201
Come on, come on. Let me in.

19:46.785 --> 19:47.752
Damn!

20:25.424 --> 20:27.517
Mr Wilczek!

20:30.562 --> 20:32.826
Going up.

20:32.931 --> 20:35.866
Second floor. Third floor. Fourth...

20:45.444 --> 20:48.242
- Can I help you?
- FBI.

21:07.666 --> 21:09.497
Welcome back, Brad.

21:12.704 --> 21:15.605
You're not equipped with a voice synthesizer.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.576
What is my user level?

21:20.646 --> 21:23.638
That is now at the discretion
of the operating system.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.387
Going up.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.428
Second floor. Third floor. Fourth floor.

21:38.063 --> 21:43.592
Fifth floor. Sixth floor.
Seventh floor. Eighth floor. Ninth floor.

21:43.669 --> 21:49.130
Tenth floor. Eleventh floor.
Twelfth floor. Fourteenth floor.

21:50.008 --> 21:52.602
Fifteenth floor. Sixteenth floor.

21:52.678 --> 21:54.737
What the hell...?

21:54.880 --> 21:56.507
What are you doing?

21:56.615 --> 22:01.018
Sorry. Those commands are not available
at your current user level.

22:01.853 --> 22:02.717
Try again.

22:03.088 --> 22:05.955
Twenty-third floor. Twenty-fourth floor.

22:07.225 --> 22:10.683
- What are you doing?!
- What are you doing?!

22:14.366 --> 22:18.462
Twenty-eighth floor. Twenty-ninth floor.

22:18.537 --> 22:20.232
Thirtieth floor.

22:20.305 --> 22:25.868
Twenty-ninth. Thirtieth.
Twenty-ninth. Thirtieth...

22:25.944 --> 22:29.675
Twenty-ninth. Thirtieth.
Twenty-ninth. Thirtieth...

22:42.728 --> 22:44.787
Oh, man!

22:47.499 --> 22:49.558
Going down.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.665
No! Don't do this!

23:03.315 --> 23:05.681
Oh, my God.

23:12.357 --> 23:14.416
Program executed.

24:04.643 --> 24:06.736
I heard about Jerry.

24:08.146 --> 24:10.205
I'm sorry.

24:12.050 --> 24:14.143
I don't think Wilczek did it.

24:16.154 --> 24:18.019
What?

24:18.490 --> 24:20.583
It doesn't make sense.

24:20.659 --> 24:22.752
Why would he go back to Eurisko?

24:24.196 --> 24:26.858
To destroy evidence. To cover his tracks.

24:26.998 --> 24:30.764
If you were gonna destroy evidence,
would you pose for the cameras?

24:43.482 --> 24:45.575
Mulder.

24:47.085 --> 24:49.178
You've been through a lot.

24:49.387 --> 24:51.787
More than I think even you realize.

24:55.393 --> 24:57.793
I think Wilczek is smarter than this.

25:05.704 --> 25:07.797
He just signed a confession.

25:10.542 --> 25:12.635
How much proof do you need?

25:36.635 --> 25:39.160
This is a crime scene. You'll have to leave.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.637
Yeah, I know. I ordered the subpoena.

25:41.706 --> 25:45.472
- That subpoena's been obviated.
- What are you talking about?

25:45.544 --> 25:50.777
Unless you've got a Code 5 clearance,
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn back.

26:17.976 --> 26:21.605
- Thanks for coming.
- I'm here against my betterjudgment.

26:21.713 --> 26:26.480
In the future I must insist that you respect
the terms of our arrangement.

26:26.551 --> 26:32.581
Why is Wilczek under a Code 5 investigation?
Why do the Defense Department want him?

26:32.691 --> 26:37.628
Why do you think they want the most
innovative programmer in this hemisphere?

26:37.729 --> 26:39.754
- Software?
- Yeah.

26:39.831 --> 26:45.531
For years Wilczek has thumbed his nose at
any contract involving weapons applications.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.629
He's a bleeding heart.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.798
What kind of software?

26:49.908 --> 26:53.571
How much do you know
about artificial intelligence?

26:53.645 --> 26:56.113
I thought it was only theoretical.

26:56.181 --> 26:58.240
It was... until two years ago.

26:58.350 --> 27:02.548
Remember Helsinki? The first time a
chess-playing computer beat a grandmaster?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.589
That was Wilczek's program.

27:05.590 --> 27:09.959
And the rumor was that he did it
by developing the first adaptive network.

27:10.996 --> 27:12.327
An adaptive network?

27:12.998 --> 27:15.125
It's a learning machine.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.725
A computer that actually thinks.

27:18.470 --> 27:22.531
And it's... become something of a holy grail

27:22.607 --> 27:26.839
for some of our more inquisitive colleagues
in the Department of Defense.

27:30.982 --> 27:34.816
They make me wear shoes all the time.
What else do you want from me?

27:34.886 --> 27:39.687
Why are you willing to spend the rest of your
life in prison for a crime you didn't commit?

27:39.791 --> 27:44.285
- What are you talking about? I'm guilty!
- I know you're innocent!

27:44.763 --> 27:49.598
You're protecting the machine.
The Central Operating System at Eurisko.

27:51.236 --> 27:53.864
If I'm protecting anything,
it's not the machine.

27:55.573 --> 27:57.632
Then what?

28:01.479 --> 28:05.813
After the bomb was dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

28:06.618 --> 28:11.920
Robert Oppenheimer spent the rest of
his life regretting he'd ever glimpsed an atom.

28:12.023 --> 28:17.051
Oppenheimer may have regretted his actions,
but he never denied responsibility for them.

28:17.195 --> 28:20.062
He loved the work, Mr Mulder.

28:21.933 --> 28:25.699
His mistake was in sharing it
with an immoral government.

28:26.604 --> 28:28.663
I won't make the same mistake.

28:29.407 --> 28:31.875
But your machine killed Drake.

28:32.744 --> 28:34.439
And it killed my friend.

28:37.148 --> 28:39.412
I'm sorry about what happened,

28:40.351 --> 28:41.750
but there's nothing I can do.

28:41.853 --> 28:43.844
And you talk about morality!

28:44.856 --> 28:48.724
You're afraid of the government, but you'll
accept the risk your machine will kill again!

28:49.694 --> 28:51.218
Lesser of two evils.

28:52.697 --> 28:54.756
What about a third option?

28:57.569 --> 28:59.867
You created that machine.

28:59.938 --> 29:02.338
Now you tell me how to destroy it.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.577
Wilczek can create a virus
to destroy the system.

29:08.680 --> 29:12.639
Mulder, don't you see? Blaming the machine
is an alibi, and a bad one.

29:12.717 --> 29:14.844
It's the only thing that makes sense.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.649
The COS project was posting
big losses for Eurisko.

29:17.722 --> 29:19.781
Drake was about to end the program.

29:19.891 --> 29:22.917
So the machine killed Drake
out of self-defense?

29:22.994 --> 29:26.657
Self-preservation -
the primary instinct of all sentient beings.

29:26.731 --> 29:31.794
Mulder, that level of artificial intelligence
is decades away from being realized.

29:31.903 --> 29:36.101
Then why was our government
trying to usurp Wilczek's research?

29:37.509 --> 29:40.000
I think you're looking for something
that isn't there.

29:40.712 --> 29:42.907
And I think it has something to do with Jerry.

29:44.949 --> 29:48.783
Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea
if you talked to someone.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.716
You're probably right.

29:55.593 --> 29:58.528
- Where are you going?
- To talk to someone.

30:22.787 --> 30:25.051
How much time do you need?

30:50.815 --> 30:52.282
Hello?

31:07.599 --> 31:09.658
Oh, my God.

31:15.773 --> 31:21.177
This is Special Agent Dana Scully,
ID number 2317-616.

31:21.246 --> 31:24.807
I need you to run a quick trace
on a number for me. Yeah.

31:25.583 --> 31:28.416
202-555-6431.

31:28.486 --> 31:32.616
Yeah, that's my number.
Somebody's accessing my computer.

31:57.815 --> 32:00.682
- Mulder!
- Scully, what are you doing here?

32:00.752 --> 32:05.121
Someone or something's been scanning
my computer files, tapping my phones.

32:05.223 --> 32:09.057
I traced the line.
It came from somewhere in there.

32:11.696 --> 32:13.061
It's the machine.

32:16.134 --> 32:18.034
How can we get in?

32:21.706 --> 32:23.765
Remember the Trojan Horse?

32:38.156 --> 32:40.920
Open sesame.

32:52.403 --> 32:53.870
Oh, what the...

32:54.472 --> 32:56.099
Mulder!

33:13.491 --> 33:15.789
So much for the element of surprise!

33:17.729 --> 33:19.890
What do you say we take the stairs?

33:32.176 --> 33:34.610
28 down, one to go.

33:39.817 --> 33:41.717
Oh, great.

33:41.786 --> 33:43.447
Mulder?

33:50.194 --> 33:52.253
Trick or treat?

34:00.571 --> 34:02.198
No!

34:02.273 --> 34:06.369
- What are you doing?
- Don't wanna make the mistake Drake made.

34:54.257 --> 34:56.123
Who you lookin' at?

35:21.619 --> 35:25.316
There should be a way for you
to drop down and open the door.

36:15.606 --> 36:16.595
Come on, Scully.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.157
Scully?

36:39.830 --> 36:42.765
Agent Mulder. What are you doing here?

38:04.515 --> 38:09.009
The machine's been acting all crazy.
Power surges, shut-offs.

38:09.086 --> 38:11.179
That's why I'm here so late.

38:11.589 --> 38:14.649
- Where's the B-port?
- Oh, it's right back here.

38:24.468 --> 38:29.929
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Because if you don't, it's my job on the line.

38:36.681 --> 38:37.409
Damn.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.551
System access granted.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.349
User code: Level 7.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.584
Now I can put in the virus.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.587
Not bad, Agent Mulder.

39:26.731 --> 39:31.134
You know, I've been trying to access
the CPU for the past two years.

39:31.202 --> 39:34.797
Now, please, take out your gun
and remove the clip.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.409
Careful.

39:46.684 --> 39:48.345
Defense Department?

39:48.419 --> 39:51.388
Let's say our paychecks are signed
by the same person.

39:51.489 --> 39:54.356
Now give me the diskette
and step away from there.

39:58.195 --> 40:02.097
You don't want to test my resolve,
Agent Mulder.

40:07.438 --> 40:09.531
Put down the gun.

40:12.143 --> 40:16.136
- You don't know what you're dealing with.
- Shut up and drop the gun!

40:21.519 --> 40:24.044
You're making a mistake, Agent Scully.

40:28.325 --> 40:30.623
Compromising your sworn duty.

40:30.761 --> 40:34.561
This operation is more sensitive
than you can possibly imagine.

40:34.632 --> 40:38.193
- Don't listen to him.
- The technology in this machine

40:38.269 --> 40:40.464
is of enormous scientific interest.

40:40.571 --> 40:43.438
It's a monster. It's killed two people.

40:43.541 --> 40:47.272
- They can't handle it any better than Wilczek.
- Make no mistake.

40:47.378 --> 40:50.006
You will be held accountable.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.150
Mulder, put in the disk.

40:59.223 --> 41:01.282
What are you doing, Brad?

41:01.659 --> 41:03.786
Don't do this, Brad.

41:04.261 --> 41:09.358
Bad command or fiile name.
Sector 7 not found home.

41:41.632 --> 41:43.497
Brad...

41:44.001 --> 41:46.060
Brad...

41:47.071 --> 41:49.869
Brad... why?

42:14.965 --> 42:18.662
I checked with the Department of
Corrections subcommittee.

42:18.736 --> 42:22.968
- I even petitioned the Attorney General.
- You won't find him.

42:23.073 --> 42:26.668
They can't take a man like Brad Wilczek
without an explanation.

42:26.744 --> 42:30.305
They can do anything they want.

42:32.516 --> 42:33.983
Where is he?

42:34.084 --> 42:37.451
In the middle of what we in the trade
call "hard bargaining".

42:38.355 --> 42:41.381
Wilczek won't deal.
He'll never work for them.

42:41.492 --> 42:46.327
Loss of freedom does funny things to a man,
and Wilczek confessed to two murders.

42:46.397 --> 42:51.164
And you effectively destroyed the only
evidence that could have exonerated him.

42:53.671 --> 42:54.797
What else could I have done?

42:55.706 --> 43:00.541
Nothing, unless you were willing
to let the technology survive.

43:02.913 --> 43:05.177
The Department of Defense
still hasn't found anything?

43:06.283 --> 43:10.310
They've been on it for five days.
Wilczek's virus was thorough.

43:10.387 --> 43:13.823
It left no trace of the artificial intelligence.

43:14.925 --> 43:16.984
The machine is dead.

43:31.208 --> 43:35.042
We pushed the pulse code modulations
to the limit.

43:35.145 --> 43:37.204
Nothing.

43:40.451 --> 43:43.545
We've combed the parsing subroutine.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.714
Yes, sir. Twice.

43:45.789 --> 43:49.054
No, sir.
Still nothing, but I'd like to request...

43:54.231 --> 43:55.664
Yes, sir.

43:55.766 --> 43:57.825
No, I understand.

43:57.968 --> 43:59.799
Yes, sir.

44:00.838 --> 44:07.402
Six more hours before we have to consign
the whole damn thing to the metal shredder.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.639
We'll do what we can, sir.

44:34.038 --> 44:37.565
I'm gonna fiigure this thing out if it
kills me.
