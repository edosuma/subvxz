WEBVTT

00:08.885 --> 00:10.375
(Ship's horn blaring)

00:10.511 --> 00:12.843
(Sonny) I don't get it.

00:12.972 --> 00:16.055
(Annie) I'm saying I need to take
a moment to myself here.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.175
Musically or what?

00:18.311 --> 00:21.519
It's just the music. It's like I said.

00:24.025 --> 00:26.437
Would you rather it was the other way?

00:26.569 --> 00:28.730
That we broke up but kept playing together?

00:28.863 --> 00:31.195
Why? We're just starting to hit our stride.

00:31.324 --> 00:34.361
I need to stretch myself, you know?

00:34.493 --> 00:36.745
l have to play in different styles.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.862
We're not practicing anymore.

00:38.998 --> 00:42.240
— We're not working on arrangements.
— What the fuck, Annie?

00:46.714 --> 00:49.296
You're drunk or high half the time.

00:49.425 --> 00:52.792
I mean, personally I'm not your mother
and I wouldn't complain about it.

00:52.929 --> 00:55.420
It's just it's hard to play music
when you're like that.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.672
— You got gigs lined up?
— No.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.514
Bullshit! This is bullshit, Annie.

00:59.644 --> 01:03.307
OK, it's bullshit, but I think we should
take a break from playing together.

01:03.439 --> 01:05.555
Without me you got no frontman.
You don't sing much.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.727
— You got nothing but the fiddle.
— I'll do what I can.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.771
So I go on the street,
you play somewhere else,

01:09.904 --> 01:12.486
then we crawl into bed
at the end of the day like it's no big deal?

01:12.615 --> 01:15.652
— Sonny, it's no big deal.
- Fuck no.

01:15.785 --> 01:19.824
We play together.
If we don't play together, we aren't together.

01:19.956 --> 01:23.198
- Sonny, please.
— Either you're with me or you're not.

01:32.134 --> 01:34.045
— Get your shit out of my apartment.
— Sonny!

01:34.178 --> 01:36.510
- |...
— Go! Just get your shit and go.

01:39.684 --> 01:41.675
— (Can clatters)
— (Ship's horn blows)

03:26.248 --> 03:28.455
Professor Bernette.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.575
— Mr. Loomis.
— You gonna be late?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.542
— Want me to fill in for you?
— No, Ben.

03:32.671 --> 03:36.038
I believe l'll fulfill my obligation for today.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.042
— Sorry.
— (Chuckles) No worries.

03:40.179 --> 03:42.135
I'm not one of those militant ex—smokers.

03:42.264 --> 03:45.597
— It's good you quit.
— Because of my size?

03:45.726 --> 03:48.968
Yeah, tobacco would be
one more bullet in the chamber.

03:49.105 --> 03:51.096
Shall we?

03:53.401 --> 03:55.892
This book is really old.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.529
(Cray) Yes, it is.

03:57.655 --> 04:00.692
But The Awakening's human concerns
are as relevant today

04:00.825 --> 04:03.737
as they were at the end of the 19th century.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.325
Hey, at least it's short.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.319
(Ben) Yeah, thank you, Professor Bernette.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.287
— (Laughter)
— (Cray) True.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.409
So I want you to take your time with it.

04:12.545 --> 04:16.663
Pay attention to the language itself,
the ideas.

04:16.799 --> 04:19.882
Don't think in terms
of a beginning and an end,

04:20.010 --> 04:22.922
because unlike some plot—driven entertainments,

04:23.055 --> 04:26.218
there is no closure in real life,

04:26.350 --> 04:28.432
not really.

04:28.561 --> 04:32.019
You said that all books are about a problem that the
protagonist has to solve.

04:32.148 --> 04:35.640
Or a quest.
The protagonist is looking for something.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.563
(Ben) So what's Edna looking for?

04:38.696 --> 04:41.563
Edna's journey is...

04:44.285 --> 04:45.946
She's looking for truth...

04:47.538 --> 04:49.403
or some kind of peace.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.405
— (Girl giggles)
— (Boy yawns)

04:51.542 --> 04:53.533
Now what can y'all tell me about the author?

04:55.004 --> 04:57.040
She was a local?

04:57.173 --> 04:59.539
Kate Chopin lived all over Louisiana.

04:59.675 --> 05:02.041
New Orleans, Natchitoches Parish.

05:02.178 --> 05:04.760
She was the daughter of a Galway man.

05:04.889 --> 05:07.380
Creole. Mostly on her mother's side.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.222
She was colored?

05:09.351 --> 05:12.559
Creole in the old sense of Creole.

05:13.606 --> 05:18.441
Professor Bernette, I know that
class participation is 10% of our grade,

05:18.569 --> 05:21.732
but are the discussions themselves
going to be on the test too?

05:21.864 --> 05:24.651
(Groans) Gwyneth, my dear,

05:24.783 --> 05:27.365
everything will be on the test

05:27.495 --> 05:30.737
and the test will be everything.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.864
But fear not,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.288
for in the end, every one of us will be tested

05:36.420 --> 05:39.708
and every one of us will be found wanting.

05:42.635 --> 05:44.626
(Girl laughs)

05:44.762 --> 05:48.971
A man on the phone tells me
he regrets to inform me that my son is dead.

05:49.099 --> 05:54.469
I told him I am looking at my only son
right there in the kitchen fixing a sandwich.

05:54.605 --> 05:58.097
— What did he say to that, Miss Cherry?
— He said, "Huh?"

05:58.234 --> 06:00.600
Just like that. "Huh?"

06:00.736 --> 06:03.068
Then he asked to speak to my son
and I put Jerome on.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.483
The man says, "Is this Jerome Cherry?"

06:05.616 --> 06:09.074
I say so and he asks if I was locked up
in Orleans Parish.

06:09.203 --> 06:12.366
| tell him I never been locked up anywhere,
not in my whole life.

06:12.498 --> 06:15.490
— What did he say to that?
— He said "Thank you" and hung up.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.912
— This caller give a name?
- He gave it,

06:18.045 --> 06:19.751
but I didn't pay it no nevermind.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.586
And I suppose you didn't have any reason

06:21.715 --> 06:24.331
to talk to LaDonna or her mother
about this phone call, did you?

06:28.847 --> 06:32.840
You're saying it was
my cousin Daymo they had under my name.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.220
(Jerome) Crazy.

06:43.946 --> 06:46.528
Watch yourself coming through, Mama.

06:46.657 --> 06:49.990
The bulk of my weight is back here.

06:50.119 --> 06:53.111
All of this is gonna go to auction.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.659
I sold the walk—in already,

06:55.791 --> 06:58.999
but we still have the prep tables,

06:59.128 --> 07:01.414
the hoods, ventilation.

07:01.547 --> 07:04.414
Is there a significant value here?

07:04.550 --> 07:06.086
I'll get something.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.880
And whatever the amount,
it'll come right back to you, I promise.

07:09.013 --> 07:10.753
Honey, that's not why I was asking.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.301
Daddy's just concerned about you,
not the money.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.345
Oh, don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.342
I'm already on to the next thing.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.435
Which is?

07:19.565 --> 07:22.898
I've been taking my act on the road.
Guerrilla chef.

07:23.027 --> 07:26.019
I got a kitchen on wheels.
I've done four events already.

07:26.155 --> 07:27.816
l've netted myself almost 1500.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.563
That much?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.861
On a good night I could clear as much profit

07:31.994 --> 07:35.486
as I did at the restaurant
even without the liquor markup.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.159
Bacchanal?

07:37.291 --> 07:40.704
Wine store. In the courtyard
they have in the back.

07:40.836 --> 07:44.044
You guys should stay an extra day
and come. I'll show you how it works.

07:44.173 --> 07:47.757
So...you're staying
in the restaurant business?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.633
What else would I do with myself?

07:52.431 --> 07:54.717
Aside from moving back to Huntsville

07:54.850 --> 07:56.806
and getting married to some lumpy lawyer

07:56.935 --> 07:59.472
and popping out grandkids,
one after the next?

07:59.605 --> 08:02.062
Would that be so bad?

08:02.191 --> 08:04.056
I'm sorry, guys.

08:04.193 --> 08:07.356
I'd rather have my head dipped in duck fat

08:07.488 --> 08:09.570
and shoved in a French oven.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.779
— (J‘ Loud music on radio)
- (Knocking at door)

08:23.504 --> 08:25.335
(Volume decreases)

08:25.464 --> 08:27.580
Man, why you gotta do that, man?

08:27.716 --> 08:29.331
lknocked,dude.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.880
| see you've got Smiley cranked to, like, 11.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.549
That's Huey Smith on ivories,
not Billy fucking Joel.

08:34.682 --> 08:37.139
You can't listen to that shit pianissimo.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.427
What...what's up, man?

08:38.560 --> 08:41.893
I'm having a record release party
on account of my EP just went gold.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.558
- (Laughs)
— New Orleans gold that is,

08:43.691 --> 08:46.728
meaning I'm still getting consignment checks two months
later.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.944
Anyway, we need to have a celebration
to cure the post-Mardem depression.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.563
There ain't been an epic throw—down

08:52.700 --> 08:55.157
— around the way since Carnival.
- Subtle as ever.

08:55.285 --> 09:00.029
My party plan is basic.
Only musicians and hot women are invited.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.030
Musicians for a jam session,

09:02.167 --> 09:03.748
hot women...

09:03.877 --> 09:06.038
for reasons
requiring no elaboration.

09:06.171 --> 09:09.004
— Musicians, hot women...
— Mm—hm.

09:09.133 --> 09:11.294
Lose the musicians,
I think you got something there.

09:11.427 --> 09:13.634
You know nothing of my alchemy.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.003
Live music is what brings women, fool.

09:16.140 --> 09:19.303
Come on, we gotta go run some of these off, get 'em up on
telephone poles.

09:19.435 --> 09:22.973
Oh, I need a keg and a bag of lndo, so...

09:23.105 --> 09:24.970
But you'll go in with me, right?

09:25.107 --> 09:28.440
Shit, Davis. I don't know.

09:31.697 --> 09:34.279
J‘ We're gonna smoke that fiyo

09:34.408 --> 09:35.864
J‘ Down on the bayou

09:35.993 --> 09:38.359
J‘ We're gonna smoke that fiyo

09:38.495 --> 09:40.577
J‘ Way down on the bayou

09:40.706 --> 09:42.617
J‘ We're gonna smoke that fiyo

09:42.750 --> 09:44.456
J‘ Way down on the bayou J‘

09:44.585 --> 09:47.247
— Come on, man! We're gonna smoke that!
— All right!

09:47.379 --> 09:49.756
— All right, I'm in, man.
— You got it, man.

10:03.187 --> 10:05.178
(Radio chatter)

10:07.566 --> 10:10.182
—Where to?
— Um...

10:11.737 --> 10:13.602
They wanted him to stay Jerome Cherry,

10:13.739 --> 10:16.481
because if he stayed Jerome Cherry
in that refrigerated trailer,

10:16.617 --> 10:19.654
— then no one would come looking for him.
- But why, Toni?

10:19.787 --> 10:23.746
Because something happened in that parish jail that they
don't want us to know about,

10:23.874 --> 10:27.492
something more than your brother
falling off his bunk and hitting his head.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.335
See? Look at this.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.511
"Comminuted..." What does that mean?

10:36.637 --> 10:39.128
The injury was to the back of the head,

10:39.264 --> 10:41.220
which could be from a fall,
but it could also be

10:41.350 --> 10:44.137
that he was struck with a blunt instrument
or kicked in the head.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.014
I promise you, LaDonna,

10:47.147 --> 10:49.479
— we're gonna get to some kind of truth.
— Please.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.189
Please.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.688
I know this hurts right now.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.897
I know it must feel like all you wanna do

10:58.033 --> 11:01.196
— is mourn for David, but...
— Toni.

11:01.328 --> 11:05.788
..it's important, before you go any further
with funeral arrangements,

11:05.916 --> 11:10.250
that we have a chance
to do an independent autopsy.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.579
No.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.877
LaDonna, given the circumstances
of David's...

11:17.010 --> 11:18.625
Oh, no, Toni, no.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.844
I'm going out to see
the cemetery people tomorrow.

11:20.973 --> 11:23.555
Daymo going home this weekend.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.141
We'll have an autopsy done before then,
I promise you.

11:26.270 --> 11:30.513
No. Now see, you trying to find out

11:30.649 --> 11:34.312
if Daymo got beat on
in that prison upstate, right?

11:35.612 --> 11:37.944
What if he did?

11:38.073 --> 11:40.610
What if he got beat on by some inmate?

11:40.742 --> 11:42.994
Or by a guard, even?

11:43.120 --> 11:45.577
What then, huh?

11:45.706 --> 11:49.290
You think getting my family all riled up
over what might have happened to Daymo

11:49.418 --> 11:52.205
is gonna make this any easier?

11:52.337 --> 11:53.873
Hell no.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.338
All this mess gonna do is make it harder.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.549
It's about right and wrong, LaDonna.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.754
The boy is dead.

12:05.267 --> 12:09.135
It stays wrong for us
no matter what else happens.

12:09.271 --> 12:12.138
And giving my mama somebody
to blame and hate on

12:12.274 --> 12:14.640
only makes it harder to get past it.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.607
LaDonna, please, just...

12:17.446 --> 12:19.732
think about this, that's all I'm asking.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.067
(J‘ Saxophone playing)

12:32.002 --> 12:33.492
(Music stops)

12:35.172 --> 12:36.662
- Hey.
— Annie?

12:40.135 --> 12:41.500
You leave or did he...

12:41.637 --> 12:44.049
Can I stay for a night or two
until I figure something out?

12:44.181 --> 12:45.546
— Yeah, no problem.
— Thank you.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.547
— If that sofa works for you.
- Yeah.

12:47.684 --> 12:51.393
I mean, I don't think we're all gonna fit in here once Dena
gets back off her tour.

12:51.521 --> 12:56.265
— She uses this front room to rehearse.
- Of course. Just a couple of days.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.687
I need to go back for the rest of my stuff

12:58.820 --> 13:01.436
once I know where I'm going.

13:01.573 --> 13:05.111
After I told him I didn't want to play with him,
he just went off on me.

13:05.243 --> 13:08.030
Annie, you told Sonny
you didn't want to play music with him?

13:08.163 --> 13:11.906
Well, for now, yeah.
Just until he gets his shit together.

13:12.834 --> 13:16.042
But so what? It wasn't like
I was trying to break us up.

13:16.171 --> 13:18.583
I mean, I'm not asking to fuck anyone else,

13:18.715 --> 13:22.424
— just gig with them, you know?
- Yeah, I don't know.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.634
You know, fucking is fucking,

13:24.763 --> 13:26.719
but music...

13:26.848 --> 13:28.884
That's personal.

13:32.604 --> 13:33.980
(Albert) Time is short.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.973
We gotta hurry
if I'm gonna make it out the door.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.725
It always comes down
to the last minute, Daddy.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.726
It always comes down
to everyone in the family

13:41.863 --> 13:43.819
working like crazy
so you could take that walk.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.565
I'm surprised you ain't got Sherry
and the kids working.

13:46.702 --> 13:50.820
(Albert) Are you gonna blame a man
for wanting to have his loving family together?

13:50.956 --> 13:52.867
Every year we're working on a better vision.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.581
You gonna be pretty, Albert.

13:54.710 --> 13:59.044
My first year not having a whole new suit.
Can't believe what that storm did.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.255
You got us up in here sweatin'
and now you're gonna get extra particular?

14:02.384 --> 14:04.591
Don't think I don't appreciate your efforts.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.507
The truth is we all gotta make do
with some of last year's suits.

14:07.639 --> 14:11.348
Man, at least y'all got enough
to make do. I ain't got nothing yet.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.058
- (Laughter)
— I'm just saying, where's my suit?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.973
— That's all.
— (George) Shit.

14:16.106 --> 14:19.348
- Boy, you trippin'.
— You got to earn that one, son.

14:19.484 --> 14:22.692
I felt the same way when l was younger, seeing my father
walk out the door

14:22.821 --> 14:26.279
on St. Joseph's night all bold and proud,
suit sparkling in the streetlight.

14:26.408 --> 14:28.774
I wanted to be making that walk with him.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.196
(Darius) ljust wanna mask with y'all,
that's all.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.536
You're not ready.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.532
Not just yet.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.954
Next year, then.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.328
If you're thinking of next year,
you gotta get ready now.

14:41.465 --> 14:44.047
J‘ Little Spy, get ready
J‘ Ooh na ney

14:44.176 --> 14:47.134
J‘ 40 Flag got ready

14:47.262 --> 14:49.628
J‘ Thank God, I'm ready

14:49.765 --> 14:52.131
J‘ No oombah
J‘ Ooh na ney

14:52.267 --> 14:54.007
J‘ Going to make fiyo
J‘ Ooh na ney

14:54.144 --> 14:56.430
J‘ Tell 'em down by the bayou

14:56.563 --> 14:57.928
J‘ Gonna set 'em all on fiyo J‘

14:58.065 --> 14:59.930
J‘ When you get back

15:00.067 --> 15:04.310
J‘ We're gonna sing a different song

15:04.446 --> 15:05.982
— J‘ But she lied J‘
- Bridge.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.526
J‘ You know that she lied

15:10.619 --> 15:13.406
J‘ You know that she lied

15:15.373 --> 15:17.989
J‘ You know that she lied J‘

15:18.126 --> 15:19.502
Hold up, fellas. Hold up.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.584
Hey, Janette. Come on in.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.419
— Hey, Jon. Hey, guys.
— Hey.

15:23.548 --> 15:26.039
I thought you might bring
a little taste with you.

15:26.176 --> 15:29.509
We'll have something nice
for you and the fellas tomorrow night.

15:29.638 --> 15:32.004
— I know Big D's looking fonNard to that.
— (J‘ Riffing)

15:32.140 --> 15:33.516
So what is on the menu, anyway?

15:33.642 --> 15:35.803
Whatever looks fresh
at the market in the morning.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.426
Apps, three entrees, dessert.

15:37.562 --> 15:40.895
Last time I cooked at Bacchanal
I did maybe 100 plates,

15:41.024 --> 15:44.232
but this time with you guys,
I'm hoping to pack the place.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.852
— Cool, let's go for it.
— So we should firm it up.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.979
What do you say to 1,000 for the night?

15:49.866 --> 15:52.528
Uh, I would say 1,200.

15:52.661 --> 15:56.529
It's a small venue,
but we need at least thatjust to plug in.

15:56.665 --> 15:59.828
- I could use a break.
— That is a break, baby.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.871
(Laughing) OK, all right.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.334
— All right, all right.
- Bye.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.124
Looking fonNard to sampling your fare.

16:05.257 --> 16:07.339
(Janette) Looking fonNard to it.
(Jon) See ya.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.459
Let's run that little bassline again.
Three, four.

16:20.689 --> 16:23.556
Yeah. Relentless, D.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.728
Relentless.

16:25.861 --> 16:27.852
(J‘ Music playing)

16:31.074 --> 16:33.065
You have to come.

16:34.536 --> 16:38.449
Hi, my name is Davis.
Will you come to my party?

16:42.377 --> 16:44.368
You come too, man. All right?

17:00.061 --> 17:02.438
(Music drowns dialogue)

17:12.824 --> 17:15.156
Brother Antoine,
I hate to interrupt your meal,

17:15.285 --> 17:18.277
— but you gotta come to this.
- What that is?

17:18.413 --> 17:20.950
Um, just the party of the year.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.118
We'll be jamming till the break of dawn.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.162
All right, I'll try to be there.

17:25.295 --> 17:28.332
Whoa! Who's this here?

17:28.465 --> 17:31.002
— That's my daughter, man, Honoree.
- Dude.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.295
Her mama was supposed
to meet up with me

17:33.428 --> 17:35.464
and get her before the gig, but she's late.

17:35.597 --> 17:39.806
— Dude, she's done up like a pork chop, man.
— (Squishing)

17:39.935 --> 17:43.177
Aw, damn, girl, what is you doin'?

17:43.313 --> 17:45.304
Oh, no, no, no, no!

17:45.440 --> 17:47.522
That was so me Mardi Gras before last.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.232
— Hey, Davis, do me a favor.
— l was...

17:49.361 --> 17:51.693
Grab me some paper towels or something.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.817
I'd love to help.
Got a few more stops to make.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.815
— Sorry, bro. She's cute.
— Bro!

17:56.952 --> 17:58.988
— She's really cute.
— You better not run away.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.156
Hey.

18:01.289 --> 18:03.029
Huh—uh.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.332
— Later.
— Ah.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.793
Mm, mm, mm.

18:36.992 --> 18:38.983
(Sighs)

18:43.581 --> 18:46.243
(Door opens, closes)

18:47.669 --> 18:49.660
(Typing)

18:52.132 --> 18:55.545
— Dinner's ready, Daddy.
— | just wanna finish this paragraph.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.167
I'll be in in a minute.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.625
Good as gold.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.593
Hey, come on!

19:40.722 --> 19:43.008
(Crowd cheering)

19:43.141 --> 19:44.802
(Woman) All right!

19:57.697 --> 20:00.905
l, uh...| thought you were gonna be out.

20:01.034 --> 20:05.368
I decided to stick around in case
you needed some help with your stuff.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.488
You working on something?

20:08.958 --> 20:10.949
A couple of songs.

20:12.087 --> 20:15.204
OK, the seeds of songs, but yeah.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.832
I've been thinking I need to write
some original stuff.

20:20.595 --> 20:23.302
— How's it going?
- Fine.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.763
You've been in my head, Annie.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.184
The taxi's double—parked.

20:30.313 --> 20:33.851
I'll be back in a few days
to get the rest of this and drop my key off.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.814
I want you to keep that key.

20:35.944 --> 20:38.151
I'd better go.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.985
Look, I made a mistake.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.440
Put that down for a minute. Let's talk about it.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.567
I can't right now.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.574
You need some time, I'm with that.

20:51.209 --> 20:53.450
So...so what about I call you?

20:53.586 --> 20:56.419
Maybe we could
meet somewhere for coffee.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.089
Coffee would be all right.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.549
(Man) We did take four foot of water.

21:05.682 --> 21:08.344
(LaDonna) Why we ain't heard
a damn thing about this until now?

21:08.476 --> 21:11.092
I got to bring my brother
up in here this weekend.

21:11.229 --> 21:14.938
Ma'am, we've been sending letters
since late January.

21:15.066 --> 21:18.854
You'rejoking, right?
My mama lives on Valence Street.

21:18.987 --> 21:22.195
She still ain't getting mail regularly.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.530
We're gonna fix this, Ma, OK?

21:24.659 --> 21:26.945
— Don't worry.
— (Grunts)

21:29.873 --> 21:32.159
We got the perpetual care, right?

21:32.292 --> 21:34.908
Sure, which provides for graveside care

21:35.044 --> 21:37.000
under basic situations.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.371
But with an act of God such as a hurricane,

21:39.507 --> 21:42.044
— there's nothing in the perpetual care pack.
- Damn.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.881
You know who you sound like?

21:46.014 --> 21:48.005
Allstate, yeah.

21:49.851 --> 21:52.058
Come on, Ma.

21:52.187 --> 21:55.475
You need to sit somewhere.
l'll deal with this.

21:55.607 --> 21:58.269
— How could David...
— |'|| fix it, Ma.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.062
|wi||.

22:03.031 --> 22:05.022
(J‘ Music blaring)

22:10.455 --> 22:13.162
Hey, neighbor.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.247
Ahh...hi.

22:16.753 --> 22:18.744
Uh...

22:19.881 --> 22:21.542
Ah.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.256
"Heaven must be like this."

22:24.385 --> 22:26.762
— Huh?
— (Davis) The Ohio Players.

22:26.888 --> 22:29.049
It's the bad solo jam off of Skin Tight.

22:29.182 --> 22:32.299
So I'm having a party tonight, my crib.

22:32.435 --> 22:35.927
— We gotta work tonight.
— (Sighs)

22:36.064 --> 22:37.679
But we'll come over after.

22:37.815 --> 22:40.067
Anything we can bring?

22:40.193 --> 22:42.058
Your...

22:42.779 --> 22:43.985
personalities.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.399
— (Women giggle)
- Thank you!

22:46.533 --> 22:48.444
- (Giggling)
— See you tonight.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.112
- See ya.
— (Staple gun clicks)

22:50.245 --> 22:53.408
Thank you. Thank you! Yes!

22:53.540 --> 22:55.531
(J‘ Music on radio)

22:57.210 --> 22:58.791
(Banging)

22:58.920 --> 23:00.410
Mr. Lambreaux.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.381
l'm Sergeant Maurice Thompson
from Community Relations.

23:05.510 --> 23:09.173
— Mm—hm.
— You remember we met back at the Calliope?

23:09.305 --> 23:12.468
— This here's Lieutenant Colson.
- What can I do for you two?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.761
— You mind if we have a word?
— Outside.

23:24.487 --> 23:27.274
| see you're working hard
on your suits in there.

23:30.535 --> 23:34.323
Look, Mr. Lambreaux, this thing between Indians and
police goes back a long ways.

23:34.455 --> 23:37.663
But last year it got really ugly
on St. Joseph's.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.783
We don't want to see it going there again.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.706
We trying to keep something alive here

23:42.839 --> 23:44.670
and y'all trying not to see it.

23:44.799 --> 23:48.007
- Now that's on y'all.
— No, that's on both sides, Chief.

23:48.136 --> 23:51.094
Now you know damn well
when the Indians put those suits on,

23:51.222 --> 23:54.840
go out in the street,
they ignore everything the police tell them.

23:54.976 --> 23:57.058
I understand pride, officers,

23:57.186 --> 23:59.017
but it seems that your gang don't think

23:59.147 --> 24:02.765
anyone other than themselves
is entitled to any.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.642
Pride got you beat up
that day at the Calliope,

24:05.778 --> 24:07.314
got you swinging on a patrolman.

24:07.447 --> 24:09.358
It was me that received the first blow.

24:09.490 --> 24:14.530
Look, Chief, you're out on bail
'cause you hit a cop and everyone knows it.

24:14.662 --> 24:17.153
Now, it's clear nothing I say
is gonna stop you or your gang

24:17.290 --> 24:18.826
from coming out on St. Joseph's night,

24:18.958 --> 24:20.994
stepping in traffic,
moving without a permit.

24:21.127 --> 24:25.245
And that means that any street cop could think they'd get a
free shot if they wanted.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.670
— You saying your people coming for us, huh?
- No, no.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.838
I'm saying that I'm worried.

24:31.971 --> 24:36.135
Now, last year I watched this thing spin out
of control. Now, maybe because of that,

24:36.267 --> 24:39.885
maybe because of what happened after
with Big Chief Tootie,

24:40.021 --> 24:43.013
l was told to come up
with a tactical plan for this year,

24:43.149 --> 24:45.640
stop it all from happening again.

24:45.777 --> 24:48.018
Well, son, what's your plan?

24:48.154 --> 24:49.985
Hell if I know.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.610
But I do remember
before he fell out at the council meeting,

24:53.743 --> 24:56.655
Big Chief Tootie was talking
about the old days, you remember?

24:56.788 --> 25:00.497
He talked about how the police would be tightening the
straps on their batons.

25:00.625 --> 25:03.537
And he would tell his gang
not to look at them,

25:03.670 --> 25:06.878
to step past the fight if they could.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.748
Big Chief Tootie died on the battlefield.

25:09.884 --> 25:12.045
It might have been
the City Council chamber to you,

25:12.178 --> 25:14.043
but it was the battlefield for us.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.967
But Tootie wasn't looking
for a battle that day.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.432
He was looking for some other way.

25:23.147 --> 25:27.015
You giving your gang the same message you're bringing
mine?

25:27.151 --> 25:29.142
I'm trying to.

25:33.574 --> 25:36.111
And the damn contract
we got for perpetual care

25:36.244 --> 25:38.576
is like 20 pages of tiny—ass print.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.696
Crazy.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.697
You call Toni Bernette?

25:42.834 --> 25:45.746
— That lawyer might could help.
— I ain't doing no more lawyers.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.869
All I need is to move that funeral
back a week

25:48.005 --> 25:50.462
and find the money
to get that crypt fixed up before then.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.673
- That's all I gotta do.
— You ain't got the money.

25:52.802 --> 25:55.589
Mm. The man saying
it's nearly 2,000 in work

25:55.722 --> 25:57.963
— to get it back right.
— (Sharp intake of breath)

25:58.099 --> 26:00.932
So go to Larry.
I mean, he gonna do the right thing on this.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.927
Nah, I can't ask him for it
when it's my family's crypt.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.645
He don't care.
He got the money and you in need.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.639
Uh—uh. I don't want it to be like that.

26:08.776 --> 26:12.394
| start leaning on his money,
soon enough he gonna be talking about

26:12.530 --> 26:14.395
ain't no reason for me
to keep this bar going.

26:14.532 --> 26:17.695
Mm—hm. So how much you got?

26:17.827 --> 26:22.321
On hand, after I pay the liquor man,

26:22.457 --> 26:23.321
1,100.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.414
— 1,100.
- (Helicopter overhead)

26:25.543 --> 26:27.499
Mm—hm.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.340
(Rustling)

26:44.645 --> 26:47.808
150 right there.

26:49.358 --> 26:52.850
Antoine, that nonsense last week
between you and me.

26:52.987 --> 26:55.148
That was a Mardi Gras fuck, that's all.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.567
— That ain't got nothing to do with it.
— I'm just saying.

He just messed up the cash flow some.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.760
I paid Riley.

29:21.886 --> 29:24.298
I ain't giving no more money
to you or anybody else.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.137
No need. I got enough saved
to cover materials

43:50.170 --> 43:53.333
— (Davis) Mm, morning.
- Hm.

43:55.926 --> 43:58.042
I'm sorry about your night.

43:59.721 --> 44:01.803
(She sighs)

44:01.932 --> 44:03.923
I'm glad you ended it here, though.

44:04.059 --> 44:06.516
No, don't be.

44:06.645 --> 44:09.011
The thunderstorm cleared things up for me.

44:10.440 --> 44:13.307
There'll be other opportunities.

44:13.443 --> 44:16.526
I know that, but not here.

44:16.655 --> 44:19.613
Ugh, not that again.

44:20.534 --> 44:24.118
— You can't...you can't be serious.
- Mm, I am.

44:25.831 --> 44:28.868
You're a damn good chef.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.084
I am better than good,
but this town beat me.

44:34.089 --> 44:36.421
As much as I love it,

44:36.550 --> 44:38.962
I'm not trying to fight with it anymore.

44:42.180 --> 44:45.047
But New York?

44:45.183 --> 44:48.892
I wanna see how I stack up
against the big boys, you know?

44:49.938 --> 44:52.224
Without all these...

44:52.357 --> 44:55.269
these broke—ass levees

44:55.402 --> 44:58.394
— and blocked gas lines and...
- Hey.

45:00.240 --> 45:04.950
May | quote the author of
La Cuisine Creole?

45:05.078 --> 45:07.114
I believe it's your professional bible.

45:07.247 --> 45:09.078
Jesus, Davis, do you ever stop?

45:09.207 --> 45:12.574
New York is very fashionable and fast,

45:12.711 --> 45:15.293
so fast you can't even stroll through it.

45:15.422 --> 45:17.788
You just get pushed along.

45:17.924 --> 45:20.586
And don't plan on getting invited
to any backyard barbecues

45:20.719 --> 45:23.131
— because there ain't no backyards.
- You don't know that.

45:23.263 --> 45:27.723
Everyone dressed in business suits,
working, working, working.

45:27.851 --> 45:30.183
Of course the, uh...what do you call it?

45:30.312 --> 45:32.894
— The financials are very strong.
— Davis.

45:36.943 --> 45:39.150
or a four—hour lunch?

45:39.279 --> 45:41.941
Would you rather have a Macy's Day Parade

45:42.073 --> 45:44.234
with fucking Bullwinkle floats...

45:45.577 --> 45:48.785
or an impromptu second line

45:48.914 --> 45:52.122
where you dance your ass off
with your neighbors?

45:53.668 --> 45:56.956
Is your check from the tourism board
in the mail?

46:08.433 --> 46:10.094
There are so many...

46:12.896 --> 46:15.308
beautiful moments here.

46:17.734 --> 46:19.645
They're just moments.

46:21.696 --> 46:24.688
They're not a life.

46:31.247 --> 46:33.203
You about to sit there all day?

46:33.333 --> 46:36.700
- What else I'm gonna do?
— Well, we could use a little help.

46:36.836 --> 46:39.327
See if you can do better
on a job than the last time.

46:39.464 --> 46:40.670
What's the job?

46:40.799 --> 46:43.165
I got a rack of supplies
I gotta pick up at Home Depot,

46:43.301 --> 46:45.792
store here in the bar...gypsum and alum.

46:45.929 --> 46:49.513
— What's that?
— Raw materials for plaster.

46:52.310 --> 46:55.802
— Boy, you wanna make some coin or what?
- I ain't seen nothing yet,

46:55.939 --> 46:58.726
after all that work I did
helping him with that suit.

46:59.526 --> 47:03.189
You do my lifting for me,
you'll get a little something today.

47:03.947 --> 47:05.357
All right.

47:08.868 --> 47:13.407
Shit, I don't know which one of you two
I feel more sorry for.

47:16.543 --> 47:18.579
(Chuckles)

47:18.712 --> 47:22.045
"She was blindly following
whatever impulse moved her

47:22.173 --> 47:26.758
"as if she had placed herself
in alien hands for direction

47:26.886 --> 47:29.878
"and freed her soul of responsibility."

47:30.015 --> 47:31.551
OK, Ben?

47:31.683 --> 47:34.015
I'm just trying to put this book
into perspective.

47:34.144 --> 47:37.682
Is The Awakening the first
women's lib novel or something?

47:37.814 --> 47:38.929
I wouldn't...

47:39.065 --> 47:43.024
No, to label it as such
would be to ghettoize a great work.

47:43.153 --> 47:45.565
(Gwyneth) Well, what happens to Edna was...

47:45.697 --> 47:48.109
I thought it was really depressing.

47:48.241 --> 47:50.277
No, no.

47:50.410 --> 47:52.947
This isn't a feminist manifesto.

47:53.079 --> 47:58.619
This book is not about Edna's emancipation from male
authority,

47:58.752 --> 48:02.461
and the ending of the book

48:02.589 --> 48:04.750
is not the end.

48:04.883 --> 48:09.126
It is a transition,

48:09.262 --> 48:13.972
a rejection of disappointment and failure.

48:14.100 --> 48:16.432
The farther Edna walks away

48:16.561 --> 48:19.098
from the constraints
of society and convention,

48:19.230 --> 48:20.766
the more free she becomes.

48:20.899 --> 48:24.812
She's not moving toward the darkness.

48:24.944 --> 48:28.357
She's embracing spiritual liberation.

48:38.458 --> 48:40.494
I'm gonna let y'all go early today.

48:40.627 --> 48:44.165
— (Girl) All right!
— Go out and read. It's a glorious day.

48:44.297 --> 48:45.878
(Students chattering)

48:50.553 --> 48:52.544
(Girl) Thank God.

48:55.350 --> 48:57.341
(Boy) You the man, teach.

48:58.228 --> 49:00.014
(Sonny) J‘ Come on, baby

49:00.146 --> 49:01.477
J‘ Let me show you where it's at

49:01.606 --> 49:05.144
J‘ Oh, come on

49:05.276 --> 49:09.019
J‘ The name of the place, I like it like that

49:09.155 --> 49:13.068
J‘ Yeah, there's a place across the track

49:13.201 --> 49:14.816
J‘ The name of the place

49:14.953 --> 49:16.489
J‘ ls I like it like that J‘

49:18.206 --> 49:19.912
(Grunting)

49:29.342 --> 49:32.800
It's called "work." Get used to it.

49:32.929 --> 49:36.046
Your back's gonna hurt
for the next 40, 50 years.

49:40.520 --> 49:43.853
Hey, I should at least get a beer
at the end of the day like y'all, right?

49:43.982 --> 49:46.473
We got one more stop to make. Let's go.

49:48.820 --> 49:50.435
What's it gonna be, then, boss?

49:50.572 --> 49:53.188
A bowl of gumbo, barbecue shrimp po' boy

49:53.324 --> 49:55.315
and another Abita Amber.

49:55.451 --> 49:57.362
That's what I like to hear.

49:57.495 --> 49:59.827
Nothing like Liuzza's, huh?

49:59.956 --> 50:03.369
Some say this one's better
than the other one on Bienville.

50:05.545 --> 50:08.002
The Pope in Avignon.

50:14.596 --> 50:16.928
(Darius) Those army dudes?

50:17.056 --> 50:19.923
(Albert) Just back from active duty in Iraq.

50:20.059 --> 50:22.436
I heard a rumor they were down here now.

50:22.562 --> 50:25.269
Wanted to see it for myself.

50:25.398 --> 50:28.765
So? You ain't changed nothing
doing what you did.

50:28.902 --> 50:31.018
Lost a battle is all.

50:31.154 --> 50:33.110
But sometimes the battles worth fighting

50:33.239 --> 50:35.321
are the ones you know you're gonna lose.

50:36.284 --> 50:38.525
Those cops, they know who you are.

50:38.661 --> 50:40.947
You see the way they keep looking at you?

50:41.080 --> 50:44.789
— Uh—huh.
— But you could get locked up again.

50:46.085 --> 50:48.667
They gonna do what they gonna do.

50:48.796 --> 50:51.924
Me, I'm gonna be heard.

50:52.050 --> 50:54.837
So that's why you wanna mask?

51:00.433 --> 51:02.173
Mm—hm.

51:06.105 --> 51:08.437
(Ship's horn blaring)

51:25.458 --> 51:27.995
I love me some Fess,
but it don't go so easily with violin.

51:28.127 --> 51:31.335
Jambalaya. I'll do Gatemouth.

51:31.464 --> 51:33.830
— (Chuckles)
- One, two.

52:10.169 --> 52:12.160
(J‘ Music on radio)

52:27.353 --> 52:29.218
Oh!

52:29.355 --> 52:31.266
So happy to see you.

52:54.839 --> 52:59.674
100 more from last night's gig, for Daymo.

53:00.970 --> 53:04.588
- Who the fuck is you?
— You can pay me back when you can.

53:04.724 --> 53:07.761
I called Larry last night.
He wiring the rest of the money today.

53:07.894 --> 53:11.637
— (Loud banging)
— Oh. Well, that's good.

53:11.773 --> 53:14.310
I know he glad he could help.

53:14.442 --> 53:16.433
(Banging continues)

53:17.737 --> 53:22.026
- You not gonna open up today?
— Why bother, with all that noise?

53:22.158 --> 53:24.945
Tell you what,
that boy's a workhorse, though.

53:25.078 --> 53:27.285
Shouldn't be all that much longer
before he's done.

53:29.082 --> 53:30.913
It's all gonna work out.

53:32.043 --> 53:34.329
You'll see.

53:35.463 --> 53:37.454
(J‘ Violin playing)

53:55.608 --> 53:57.314
Are you sure?

53:58.528 --> 54:00.519
Always for pleasure, dear.

54:36.649 --> 54:38.435
Can I burn one of those from you?

54:38.568 --> 54:41.310
- They're reds.
— All the better.

54:55.001 --> 54:59.335
Don't ever let anyone tell you to quit.
These are wonderful.

55:00.756 --> 55:02.747
Obliged.

55:04.510 --> 55:07.502
- (Birds squawking)
— (J‘ Organ music playing)

56:12.954 --> 56:15.696
— Where are you headed?
- My place.

56:15.831 --> 56:18.243
Where's that?

56:19.001 --> 56:20.912
You want me to walk with you?

56:21.045 --> 56:24.663
I'll be OK. It's just a couple of blocks.

56:26.133 --> 56:29.500
I hope we, uh, play together again. Night.

56:43.609 --> 56:46.396
What exactly is a dependent clause?

56:46.529 --> 56:49.987
You're asking the wrong person.
That's your father's department.

56:50.116 --> 56:54.280
But I need to turn this in tomorrow.
Where is he?

56:54.412 --> 56:57.370
I tried to call. He's not answering his cell.

56:59.834 --> 57:02.041
Probably just out ofjuice.

57:02.169 --> 57:04.546
You know how he forgets to charge it.

57:12.138 --> 57:14.254
(Buoy bell clanging)

57:14.390 --> 57:17.132
(Ship's horn blaring)
