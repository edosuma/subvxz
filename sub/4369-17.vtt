00:07.338 --> 00:11.632
Wait, there's one thing
I wanna see first.

00:11.632 --> 00:14.475
Barry? Why would we want you
to take away our power?

00:14.475 --> 00:17.398
You said if you kept them,
something terrible
would happen in the future.

00:17.398 --> 00:19.400
What does "JS" stand for?

00:19.400 --> 00:20.901
Janet Smythe?

00:20.901 --> 00:22.853
This dystopian Smythe of hers

00:22.853 --> 00:25.356
must be the bad future
we were trying to prevent.

00:25.356 --> 00:27.408
Barry and Naldo are frozen.

00:27.408 --> 00:30.321
Are you serious?
Janet's got 'em on display
like trophies.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.953
Take these girls
to the suspended
animation chamber.

00:40.461 --> 00:42.293
We have to figure out
a way to keep

00:42.293 --> 00:44.255
that dystopian Smythe-iverse
from happening.

00:44.255 --> 00:47.468
And to keep us all
from getting frozen
like popsicles.

00:47.468 --> 00:49.049
Shelbs, you gave me an idea.

00:51.342 --> 00:54.225
Now how do we stop
Janet from getting the power
to time travel?

00:54.225 --> 00:58.389
And becoming an evil overlord
who freezes people
like snow cones.

01:01.232 --> 01:04.985
We're really not getting
very far in this whole
stopping Janet thing.

01:04.985 --> 01:08.279
Do we have to deal
with it tonight?
I'm so sick of Janet Smythe.

01:08.279 --> 01:11.031
Can we just go one night
without worrying
about Janet Smythe?

01:11.031 --> 01:15.536
Girls, Janet Smythe
is coming over
for dinner tonight.

01:15.536 --> 01:17.658
Oh no, do you think
it's 'cause of us?

01:17.658 --> 01:18.909
Why would it be
because of you?

01:18.909 --> 01:21.041
Because she's evil!
 No reason.

01:21.041 --> 01:22.293
No reason.

coming when your mother's
out of town

02:50.381 --> 02:51.672
on her spa retreat?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.294
She's the cook in the family.

02:53.294 --> 02:57.097
Maybe I can get her
to come home a day early.

02:57.097 --> 03:00.511
Astrid, hi honey,
there's something
I want to ask you.

03:00.511 --> 03:03.724
Oh, Norm, it's so
wonderful here.

03:03.724 --> 03:07.228
I needed this so much.

03:07.228 --> 03:10.361
You are the best husband
in the world.

03:10.361 --> 03:14.024
Dang it! Why do I have to be
such a good husband?

03:14.024 --> 03:16.697

have a great weekend, honey.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.159

03:19.159 --> 03:21.242

all those muscles
aren't just for show.

03:26.086 --> 03:27.958
Who is going to cook dinner?

03:27.958 --> 03:30.591
I'm a lousy cook
and I can't order takeout
for my boss.

03:30.591 --> 03:34.465
Hey, Barry makes
a great Beef Wellington.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.637
Yes! I don't know
what Beef Wellington is,

03:36.637 --> 03:38.889
but I've heard
very good things
about "great."

03:42.222 --> 03:44.475
Janet's gotta be
coming after us again!

03:44.475 --> 03:47.608
Why won't she
leave us alone?
 No, Shelbs, think about it.

03:47.608 --> 03:49.560
Every time she's tried
to do something to us,

03:49.560 --> 03:51.402
it's been in
a different timeline.

03:51.402 --> 03:52.693
In this timeline
she's never met us.

03:52.693 --> 03:54.565
She has no idea who we are.

03:54.565 --> 03:55.986
You're right.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.068
We could use this dinner
as a chance

03:58.068 --> 03:59.450
to confront her
and find out

03:59.450 --> 04:00.741
how she gets the power
to time travel

04:00.741 --> 04:02.323
so we know how to stop it.

04:02.323 --> 04:04.244
Then we can jump back
and eat dinner again

04:04.244 --> 04:06.867
so we can erase that timeline
and she'll never know
it happened.

04:06.867 --> 04:09.079
You know we just have
to erase the timeline.

04:09.079 --> 04:10.541
We don't have
to eat dinner twice.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.503
Don't mess with the plan.
It works.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.680
Barry you ever heard
the expression,

04:19.680 --> 04:21.591
"There are no
original thoughts"?
 Yes.

04:21.591 --> 04:23.764
Dang it! I thought
I made that up.

04:25.596 --> 04:26.687
Hello boys.

04:26.687 --> 04:27.648
Hello, Mr. Marcus.

04:27.648 --> 04:29.730
Hey, Mr. Marcus.
 I need your help.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.522
My boss, Janet Smythe,
is coming over

04:31.522 --> 04:34.775
for dinner tonight
and I hear you make
a great Beef Wellington.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.236
Janet Smythe?
She's one of my heroes.

04:36.236 --> 04:37.738
I would be happy to make
my Beef Wellington.

04:37.738 --> 04:39.530
And I'd be happy to help.
 Yes.

04:40.861 --> 04:42.613
Kinda weird having you
in our RV.

04:42.613 --> 04:44.995
You hang out in my kitchen,
you use my hot tub,

04:44.995 --> 04:47.668
steal my Wi-Fi,
and I step into your RV,

04:47.668 --> 04:48.709
and that's weird?

04:50.671 --> 04:52.623
Yeah, kinda is.
 Super weird.

04:56.627 --> 04:58.178
Right this way, Ms. Smythe.

04:58.178 --> 05:00.421
We can start with appetizers
in the backyard.

05:00.421 --> 05:03.223
Okay, Janet doesn't know us
at all in this timeline.

05:03.223 --> 05:06.807
We're gonna find out
everything she knows
about time travel.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.770
So, Ms. Smythe...
 Norm, please, call me...

05:09.770 --> 05:11.482
Wait, you said Ms. Smythe...

05:11.482 --> 05:13.023
Yes, that's right.

05:13.984 --> 05:15.776
Hi, I'm Shelby.

05:15.776 --> 05:18.028
We have never met before,
have we, ma'am?

05:18.028 --> 05:19.650
Why are you talking
like a magician?

05:19.650 --> 05:21.702
It's something I do
when I get nervous.

05:21.702 --> 05:23.704
There's nothing
up my sleeve.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.157
I'm just so glad you're here.

05:27.157 --> 05:28.709
Because you want to...

05:30.661 --> 05:32.833
Especially because you...

05:34.715 --> 05:37.838
Not a fan of finishing
other people's sentences, huh?
Neither am I.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.590
I don't even like
finishing my own.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.341
So I'm gonna...

05:46.637 --> 05:47.638
(GASPS)

05:50.641 --> 05:53.063
What are you boys doing?

05:53.063 --> 05:55.145
Making Beef Wellington.
Just like you asked.

05:55.145 --> 05:57.818
But... Are those
Bunsen burners?
And car batteries?

05:57.818 --> 05:59.860
A Tesla coil?

05:59.860 --> 06:03.574
Are you cooking
a Beef Wellington
or bringing it back to life?

06:03.574 --> 06:05.576
Mr. Marcus, I'm a scientist.

06:05.576 --> 06:07.077
This is how I cook food.

06:07.077 --> 06:09.620
It never even occurred to me
to bring it back to life.

06:09.620 --> 06:12.703
But if I do I will make
this potato its bride.

06:14.204 --> 06:16.256
Masks on everyone.

06:19.710 --> 06:22.553
Great, now all I can
think about is bringing it
back to life.

06:24.505 --> 06:27.428
So, Janet tell us...

06:27.428 --> 06:30.771
How are things at the office?
Any secret science stuff
you working on?

06:30.771 --> 06:34.565
Yeah, like, oh,
I don't know, time travel?

06:34.565 --> 06:36.276
Oh, that's a fun example.

06:36.276 --> 06:37.608
Let's talk about that.

06:39.610 --> 06:42.483
Odd that you would
mention time travel.

06:42.483 --> 06:44.485
I have been working on that.

06:44.485 --> 06:49.790
Ever since I found
tachyon particles
in my garage in 1991.

06:49.790 --> 06:52.953
I soon discovered
 they were connected
 to time travel

06:52.953 --> 06:55.876
and I wanted that power
 for myself.

06:55.876 --> 06:58.919
So I created a device I call
 a tachyometer.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.753
It senses the presence
of tachyon particles.

07:02.753 --> 07:05.926
I detected small amounts
of tachyons on your father.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.928
Not enough to make
him a time traveler

07:07.928 --> 07:11.472
but clearly he was in contact
with someone who is.

07:11.472 --> 07:14.605
And that's why you're here.

07:15.766 --> 07:17.818
You came to find us...

07:18.729 --> 07:20.020
(TACHYOMETER BEEPING RAPIDLY)

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:29.950 --> 07:33.333
So now you know
we're time travelers,
what do you want from us?

07:33.333 --> 07:37.628
I need more tachyons
to develop my own power
to time travel.

07:37.628 --> 07:39.670
And my scientists
have discovered a way

07:39.670 --> 07:41.712
to harvest them from you.

07:41.712 --> 07:44.174
I just needed to find you.

07:44.174 --> 07:45.385
Dinner is almost ready.

07:45.385 --> 07:47.257
I hope you like
Beef Wellington.

07:47.257 --> 07:48.929
I'm a vegetarian.

07:48.929 --> 07:51.802
As I'm sure you know
from reading my autobiography.

07:51.802 --> 07:54.054
Chapter seven is all about
my rejection of meat.

07:54.054 --> 07:55.856
Of course I know that.

07:55.856 --> 07:57.768
I've read that autobiography
many times.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.810
I was just joking.
 Why?

07:59.810 --> 08:02.362
Chapter thirteen is all about
my rejection of humor.

08:03.904 --> 08:05.155
Of course it is.

08:05.155 --> 08:07.818
Just a meatless,
humorless dinner here.

08:07.818 --> 08:10.871
We'll all just weep
quietly into our salads.

08:10.871 --> 08:12.783
That was a joke. Dang it!

08:14.825 --> 08:16.537
Janet Smythe doesn't eat meat!

08:16.537 --> 08:18.749
Of course she doesn't.
Haven't you read
her autobiography?

08:19.880 --> 08:21.121
You knew?

08:21.121 --> 08:22.883
Then why are you cooking
Beef Wellington?

08:22.883 --> 08:24.625
Because you told me to.

08:24.625 --> 08:25.796
I figured you knew
what you're doing.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.758
Why would anybody figure that?

08:29.469 --> 08:32.972
Now that I've found you,
I have my source of tachyons

08:32.972 --> 08:36.476
and can finally give myself
the power to time travel.

08:36.476 --> 08:38.808
There is no way we're gonna
let you do that.

08:38.808 --> 08:41.061
Really? What are you idiots
gonna do to stop me?

08:41.061 --> 08:42.813
We're gonna jump back
to the beginning of the night

08:42.813 --> 08:45.856
so, you have no idea
this conversation
ever took place.

08:45.856 --> 08:48.649
Boom! You just got stopped
by idiots!

08:48.649 --> 08:50.951
That did not come out
as tough as I wanted it to.

08:53.453 --> 08:55.415
Okay. We're back to before
Janet got here.

08:55.415 --> 08:57.157
We just have to stay upstairs
until she leaves

08:57.157 --> 08:59.620
so she'll never find us,
never get the power
to time travel

08:59.620 --> 09:01.501
and there will never be
that dystopian future.

09:01.501 --> 09:03.924
We just totally
outsmarted her!

09:03.924 --> 09:05.836
One other thing.
 (BOTH SCREAM)

09:07.547 --> 09:10.130
The tachyometer
also gives me the ability

09:10.130 --> 09:12.933
to remember every timeline
that I'm in.

09:12.933 --> 09:14.765
So time jump all you want.

09:14.765 --> 09:16.476
I'll remember everything.

09:16.476 --> 09:18.138
Just like you do.

09:18.138 --> 09:22.182
So, you remember
our whole conversation
from before?

09:22.182 --> 09:24.484
And you know that we're
the time travelers you need

09:24.484 --> 09:26.026
to get the power for yourself.

09:26.026 --> 09:27.567
I remember all of it.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.690
And even if I didn't,
you just told me again.

09:29.690 --> 09:30.741
Idiots.

09:32.452 --> 09:34.244
Ms. Smythe. There you are
Dinner is...

09:34.244 --> 09:36.617
I don't eat meat and I know
you haven't read
my autobiography.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.038
Don't make a joke about it.

09:38.038 --> 09:39.830
I also don't like humor.

09:42.042 --> 09:45.205
I'm not going to take you away
in front of your father.

09:45.205 --> 09:46.627
But I'll be back for you.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.631
Emergency! Emergency!

09:50.631 --> 09:51.882
Janet doesn't eat meat!

09:51.882 --> 09:53.513
We need a vegetarian option.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.136
There we go.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.389
Eggplant.

09:59.389 --> 10:00.931
I will substitute this
for the beef fillet

10:00.931 --> 10:03.063
and Janet will say
it's just as good as meat

10:03.063 --> 10:04.895
because that's what
vegetarians do.

10:07.027 --> 10:08.108
I'll be leaving now.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.279
Thank you for a lovely time.

10:09.279 --> 10:11.281
But... What about dinner?

10:11.281 --> 10:13.073
I didn't know why
you were coming over
and that was weird

10:13.073 --> 10:15.996
and now I don't know
why you're leaving
which is more weird.

10:15.996 --> 10:18.078
It's like we're dating...

10:18.078 --> 10:22.452
Hey, guess who
just made it weirder.

10:22.452 --> 10:26.046
Ms. Smythe.
I've prepared a wonderful
Eggplant Wellington for you.

10:26.046 --> 10:26.957
And masks on.

10:30.711 --> 10:31.712
(EXPLOSION)

10:35.716 --> 10:38.218
Well, if you absolutely
must be going,
please drive safely.

10:41.181 --> 10:44.104
Janet knows
we're time travelers.

10:44.104 --> 10:47.187
She's gonna come back
and use us to give her
the power to time travel.

10:47.187 --> 10:49.229
This is how she gets it.

10:49.229 --> 10:53.033
This is what leads
to the dystopian
Smythe-iverse.

10:53.033 --> 10:55.575
We've really messed this up.

10:55.575 --> 10:56.947
And there's nothing we can do.

10:58.198 --> 11:00.660
There is one thing.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.082
We could get rid of our power.

11:03.784 --> 11:06.707
(SIGHS) It's the only way to
keep Janet from getting it.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.499
It's the only way
to keep Barry and Naldo
from being frozen.

11:09.499 --> 11:11.131
But Shelbs our power.

11:11.131 --> 11:12.923
There must be
something else
we can do.

11:12.923 --> 11:15.385
We don't deserve it anyway.

11:15.385 --> 11:17.467
We're not superheroes, Cyd.

11:17.467 --> 11:20.180
We're a couple
of teenage girls who've been
fooling around with it

11:20.180 --> 11:22.012
and now look
what we've done.

11:22.012 --> 11:25.605
Do you think this is why
we were getting rid of
our power in the Future Lab?

11:25.605 --> 11:27.898
I think everything's
been leading to this.

11:29.519 --> 11:32.192
What happened up here?
You scared Janet away.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.444
Did you remind her
she has a skeleton inside her?

11:34.444 --> 11:36.987
That always scares me.

11:36.987 --> 11:39.990
Barry, we need you to
take away our powers
in the Future Lab.

11:39.990 --> 11:43.033
Which isn't
the future anymore.

11:43.033 --> 11:47.167
I know you haven't cracked
time travel but do you think
you can take our powers?

11:47.167 --> 11:49.039
In studying
the tachyons
I have discovered

11:49.039 --> 11:52.883
that they can be disrupted
by a massive burst
of upsilon radiation.

11:52.883 --> 11:54.795
The laser you saw in
the Future Lab should do it.

11:54.795 --> 11:57.217
But why would you want
your powers removed?

11:57.217 --> 11:58.508
We can't tell you.

11:58.508 --> 12:00.140
It's for
your own safety.

12:00.140 --> 12:02.142
Well, I am a big fan
of my own safety.

12:02.142 --> 12:03.223
That's why
I don't play football.

12:05.185 --> 12:06.937
What? It's the only reason!

12:08.348 --> 12:10.110
All right,
let's go to
the Future Lab.

12:10.110 --> 12:11.852
No, wait! Naldo,
you weren't there with us.

12:11.852 --> 12:12.943
So you don't
have to come.

12:12.943 --> 12:14.114
It's probably for the best.

12:14.114 --> 12:15.776
I'm a fan of my safety too.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.527
That's why I don't pull
the tails of strange dogs.

12:18.618 --> 12:20.360
What? It's the only reason.

12:27.127 --> 12:28.789
Man!

12:28.789 --> 12:32.132
GDD looks so different
from last time we were here.

12:32.132 --> 12:34.334
Janet getting
those tachyons in 1991

12:34.334 --> 12:37.087
must have changed everything
with how she runs this place.

12:37.087 --> 12:39.219
Wait! So you've been
here before?

12:39.219 --> 12:42.142
And Janet got
tachyons in 1991?
And why are you smiling?

12:42.142 --> 12:45.305
Just enjoying being smarter
than you for once.

12:45.305 --> 12:48.518
That kind of
warm feeling in here,
what do you call that?

12:48.518 --> 12:50.390
Smugness.
It's nice isn't it?

12:52.102 --> 12:54.564
This place is like a fortress.
How are we gonna get in?

12:54.564 --> 12:56.066
I took my dad's keycard.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.238
This should get us through
the front desk. Let's go.

12:59.990 --> 13:02.112
(BEEPING)

13:06.957 --> 13:08.078

13:09.619 --> 13:11.711

13:11.711 --> 13:14.334
Hello? Yes, of course,
I have my keycard.

13:14.334 --> 13:15.795
I have it right here.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.588
Couldn't lose my keycard.
I'd be in big trouble.

13:18.588 --> 13:20.971
Yep, I am holding
my keycard.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.553
Definitely not
a pack of gum

13:23.553 --> 13:25.305
that went through
the washing machine.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.728
And apparently
got ironed.

13:28.728 --> 13:32.192
Well, if it says that
someone used it to gain
access to the secure floor

13:32.192 --> 13:34.814
then, yes, delete
the old pack of gum,

13:34.814 --> 13:37.988
uh, keycard
and issue me
a new pack of gum.

13:38.278 --> 13:39.529
Keycard.

13:40.991 --> 13:43.033
Yes, I'll be
right there. Thank you.

13:45.285 --> 13:47.037
Hey, Dad.
 What's for dinner?

13:47.037 --> 13:48.208
What are you
boys doing here?

13:48.208 --> 13:52.122
We live here.
 We have for a while now.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.753
Have you boys been home
this whole night?

13:53.753 --> 13:57.047
Chet, we were here
and he didn't even know it.

13:57.047 --> 13:58.458
We'd be great spies.

13:58.458 --> 14:01.341
We could have
all new identities.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.722
I'll be Dark Star.

14:02.722 --> 14:04.925
I'll be Chet.
 But I'm Chet.

14:04.925 --> 14:08.228
Way to give up
your true identity,
Dark Star.

14:11.731 --> 14:13.353
Is Barry here?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.734
I can't find the girls and
I need someone to babysit

14:14.734 --> 14:16.436
the twins while I run down
to the office real quick.

14:16.436 --> 14:18.028
I can babysit.

14:18.028 --> 14:19.319
Have you ever taken
care of anything, Naldo?

14:19.319 --> 14:20.400
I've been taking
care of that plant.

14:25.325 --> 14:26.576
Good enough for me!

14:36.836 --> 14:39.129
This is
a restricted area now.

14:40.210 --> 14:42.882
There are cameras everywhere.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.714
How are we going
to get through here?

14:47.717 --> 14:49.269
(ALARM BLARING)

15:04.114 --> 15:05.615
(LOUD SHRILL)

15:12.242 --> 15:14.664
We're gonna need
some stuff to help us
get through security.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.337
But we'll never get anything
through that metal detector.

15:17.337 --> 15:19.419
Wait, I thought we were
just going to use
your dad's keycard?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.921
Yeah, we tried that
ten minutes ago.
We didn't get very far.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.673
What happened?
 You were awesome.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.305
You took down
six security guards,

15:25.305 --> 15:27.137
did this parkour move
up the wall!

15:27.137 --> 15:28.638
It was crazy!

15:28.638 --> 15:30.260
I just asked what happened.
You don't have to mock me.

15:31.891 --> 15:34.684
Wait, I have an idea.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.726
Do you remember
when we were five,

15:36.726 --> 15:39.019
and you came here with me
and my dad on "Bring
Your Daughter To Work" day?

15:39.019 --> 15:42.522
We can jump back to then
 and hide equipment that
 we can use to get in now.

15:42.522 --> 15:44.864
CYD: Yes!
 I'll create a diversion.

15:44.864 --> 15:46.776
Oh, no!
An accident!

15:46.776 --> 15:48.488
You're gonna have one
or cause one?

15:48.488 --> 15:49.699
Guess!

15:52.452 --> 15:54.244

 the equipment.

That's gotta be
the Future Lab.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.641
We have to get
by those guards.

17:03.443 --> 17:05.105

 a digital recorder
 in the vent.

You set a timer
for ten years?

Ten years?

17:26.965 --> 17:29.089
You set a timer
for ten years?

17:29.089 --> 17:30.800
Umm, of course,
we're not stupid.

I'm here to get
my keycard reissued?

17:49.529 --> 17:51.491
Really? I have to
fill all these out?

Really? I have to
fill all these up?

17:56.536 --> 17:58.248
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
 Hold on.

17:59.289 --> 18:00.500
Hey, Astrid.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.581
Hey, Norm.

18:03.663 --> 18:05.465
Just wanted to remind you
that the twins have

18:05.465 --> 18:08.208
that big project due
for school tomorrow.

18:08.208 --> 18:09.419
Astrid, relax.

18:09.419 --> 18:11.301
Normy Smooth has got it.

18:11.301 --> 18:13.263
Oh, no.

18:13.263 --> 18:15.475
Last time
Normy Smooth "had it"
the water heater blew up.

18:17.267 --> 18:18.638
Get yourself
a caviar scrub.

18:18.638 --> 18:19.849
There's no such thing.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.521
Just get it!

18:23.683 --> 18:27.277
Naldo, you have to make
sure that the twins work
on their big project.

18:27.277 --> 18:29.569
It's due tomorrow!
 NALDO: Don't worry
 about it, Mr. Marcus.

18:29.569 --> 18:31.691
Everything is
 under control.

18:31.691 --> 18:33.283
NALDO: Time for
your school project.

18:33.283 --> 18:34.904
We need to
stop playing Art Gallery.

18:37.577 --> 18:41.000
Notice the vacant look
in the eyes staring out
towards a future

18:41.000 --> 18:42.622
he will never experience.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.505

it screams
when you pinch it.

to do your project.

18:55.805 --> 18:57.517
Are you ready, Bret?

18:57.517 --> 18:59.519

19:06.186 --> 19:07.647
This is awesome!

19:07.647 --> 19:08.858
So how are you going
to get it to school?

19:12.442 --> 19:14.734
(GASPS)
What is going on?

19:19.539 --> 19:22.081
Sorry, Mr. Marcus.
 No, no, it's on me.

19:22.081 --> 19:23.583
I ignored
the burning plant.

19:26.376 --> 19:29.249
Hey, honey!
Glad I got your voicemail!

19:29.249 --> 19:31.211
A few quick updates
to prepare you

19:31.211 --> 19:33.593
for what you're gonna find
when you get home.

Don't forget
the hole in the wall.

19:37.136 --> 19:38.598
It's from my head.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.476
All right, guys.
I'm going to go put
on a protective suit.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.147
Just be aware that
when I come back

19:48.147 --> 19:49.689
I won't be able to hear you
with the helmet on.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.402

I can't believe
we're not gonna be
time travelers anymore.

What else can we do,
if we want to stop Janet?

20:00.820 --> 20:02.992
We're not superheroes, Cyd.

20:02.992 --> 20:05.495
Us having this power
messes up the future.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.959
It's been
an adventure though, huh?

20:09.959 --> 20:11.921
Reliving how we met...

20:11.921 --> 20:13.543
Dancing in the '70s...

20:13.543 --> 20:15.425
Becoming ghosts in New York.

20:17.337 --> 20:19.549
I never thought
we could be better friends

20:19.549 --> 20:23.643
but everything
we've gone through this year
has made us so much closer.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.726
I know.

20:26.726 --> 20:30.560
This has been something
we've shared that no one else
in the whole world has shared.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.901
(SOFT CHUCKLE)

20:32.982 --> 20:34.314

20:38.067 --> 20:40.570
It won't be
the same though, will it?

20:50.630 --> 20:52.462
So we're really
going to do this?

20:53.293 --> 20:54.584
Let's do it.

21:15.445 --> 21:16.606

21:31.791 --> 21:35.174
It's so weird
not being able
to time travel.

21:35.174 --> 21:37.547
I couldn't jump back
and have three breakfasts.

21:37.547 --> 21:40.760
So I had to eat
three breakfasts
all in the present.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.722
I think I made myself
a little sick, Shelbs.

21:44.514 --> 21:47.056
And I couldn't jump back and
watch you eat three breakfasts

21:47.056 --> 21:49.188
so I had to
do it all in the present.

21:49.188 --> 21:50.600
Made me
a little sick too.

21:52.772 --> 21:55.775
We did the right thing,
didn't we?

21:55.775 --> 21:59.108
Well, we had to do it
to stop Barry and Naldo
from being frozen.

22:01.491 --> 22:04.614
The most important thing
is keeping our friends safe.

22:06.616 --> 22:08.538
JANET: I know you're not
time travelers anymore.

22:11.290 --> 22:14.043
And I know that
Barry is the brains
behind all of it.

22:15.044 --> 22:17.006
So instead of
taking you two,

22:17.006 --> 22:21.841
I took him and his friend
and all their equipment.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.303
They are going to
synthesize time travel for me.

22:24.303 --> 22:26.726
And now you're powerless
to do anything about it.
