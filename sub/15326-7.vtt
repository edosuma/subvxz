I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE; YOU'VE GOT KIDS.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.586
- YOU HAVE A KID,
AND YOU'RE GOING SOMEWHERE.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.214
- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.841
NOW HERE ARE BRODY'S ALLERGIES,

08:28.925 --> 08:31.010
NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS,
AND BEDTIME ROUTINE.

08:31.093 --> 08:33.011
- OH, LOOK.

08:33.095 --> 08:36.097
HE COMES WITH A USER'S MANUAL.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.226
- YEAH, WE GOT COPIES IN CLASS.

08:38.308 --> 08:42.438
HE'S WHY I CAN'T HAVE
PEANUT BUTTER.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.774
- HE'S VEGAN, ASTHMATIC,
AND CORN INTOLERANT.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.484
WHEN IN DOUBT,
DON'T GIVE IT TO HIM,

08:46.567 --> 08:48.444
FEED IT TO HIM,
OR SAY IT TO HIM.

08:48.527 --> 08:51.489
[whispers]
HE'S SENSITIVE.

08:51.572 --> 08:52.990
NO NUTS, G.M.O.s OR--

08:53.074 --> 08:54.617
- AIR?
[laughs]

08:54.700 --> 08:56.035
- EXACTLY.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.413
SO I PACKED HIS PURIFIER.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.958
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
SO MUCH FUN.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.584
OH, THAT REMINDS ME.

09:03.668 --> 09:04.961
DON'T LET HIM LAUGH.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.754
IT TRIGGERS HIS ASTHMA.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.966
- SO WHAT TIME FIRST THING
TOMORROW ARE YOU PICKING HIM UP

09:10.049 --> 09:10.967
FIRST THING TOMORROW?

09:11.050 --> 09:14.011
- [laughs]
YOU'RE FUNNY.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.348
HAVE A SAFE TIME, BOYS.

09:17.431 --> 09:18.432
BYE.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.937
- AARON'S MOM, I'M HUNGRY.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.856
WHAT DO YOU HAVE THAT'S
ON MY APPROVED FOOD LIST?

09:25.940 --> 09:30.027
- AH, WELL,
FROM THE LOOKS OF THIS, WATER.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.904
OH, WAIT--WE DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF WATER.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.615
- GABBY, CAN YOU PLEASE WALK
TO THE STORE FOR ME.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.825
- I WOULD LOVE TO.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.785
ALWAYS HAPPY TO HELP YOU OUT,
STEPHANIE.

09:37.868 --> 09:39.370
- I FEEL LIKE
I'M FORGETTING SOMETHING.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.496
- SHE'S GROUNDED.

09:40.579 --> 09:43.374
- THAT'S IT.
- SERIOUSLY?

09:43.457 --> 09:46.043
- I AM SO TIRED,
I ALMOST LOST ONE.

09:46.127 --> 09:49.839
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'VE
BEEN UP FOR OVER 24 HOURS.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.383
JAMES, COME ON,
WE HAVE TO RUN TO THE STORE.

09:52.466 --> 09:55.469
HEY, BRODY, WHERE DOES YOUR MOM

09:55.553 --> 09:59.015
GET ALKALINE WATER AND
CORN SYRUP-FREE SEAWEED GUMMIES?

09:59.098 --> 10:01.517
- AISLE SIX.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.440
- ♪ LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT ♪

10:07.523 --> 10:09.442
♪ LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT ♪

10:09.525 --> 10:11.277
COMPANY HALT.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.403
[both laugh]

10:12.486 --> 10:13.571
BRODY, HONEY.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.948
NO LAUGHING.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.867
- MY MOM LETS ME CHUCKLE.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.580
- JAMES, STOP EATING ALL
OF BRODY'S SEAWEED GUMMIES.

10:22.663 --> 10:23.956
- IT'S NOT THAT BAD
WHEN YOU DIP IT

10:24.040 --> 10:26.334
IN THIS GREEN
SUPER FOOD POWDER.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.544
- AND STOP EATING
HIS SUPER FOOD POWDER.

10:28.627 --> 10:30.713
BOYS,
GO PUT THESE GROCERIES AWAY.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.631
AND, JAMES, DO ME A FAVOR.

10:32.715 --> 10:36.218
MAKE BRODY A BROWN RICE CAKE
AND EDAMAME BUTTER SANDWICH.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.262
- YAY!

10:42.975 --> 10:44.602
- THAT BED'S GREAT.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.354
I SLEPT LIKE A BABY.

10:46.437 --> 10:50.566
- HMM, I SLEPT LIKE A NEW MOM,
AS IN NOT AT ALL.

10:50.649 --> 10:52.860
I TOTALLY NEED TO SHUT MY EYES
FOR AN HOUR.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.737
[doorbell rings]

10:54.820 --> 10:57.031
- WELL, IT CAN'T BE THE NEXT
HOUR, LAZYBONES.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.492
THAT'S HOLLY AND NIKKI
AND JULES.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.952
- HOLLY, NIKKI, AND JULES
ARE YOUR FRIENDS.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.621
- AND I NEVER GET TO SEE THEM.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.999
HOW COOL IS THIS?

11:07.083 --> 11:09.877
[all cackling]

11:16.300 --> 11:18.511
[all scream]

11:18.594 --> 11:21.013
- STEPHANIE,
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

11:21.097 --> 11:23.516
- UH, GOING ON 34 HOURS.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.560
- DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.311
YOU CAN SLEEP WHEN YOU'RE DEAD.

11:27.395 --> 11:30.439
- OKAY, LET'S DO THAT.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.858
[all cackling]

11:34.568 --> 11:35.778
- I FOUND THREE KINDS:

11:35.861 --> 11:39.448
SINGLES, STRING,
AND THIS STUFF IN A CAN.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.242
I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF HOOKED.
[chuckles]

11:41.325 --> 11:42.785
[thumps]

11:42.868 --> 11:44.078
MMM.

11:44.161 --> 11:47.498
AARON, BRODY,
YOU SHOULD BE IN BED.

11:47.581 --> 11:48.207
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

11:48.290 --> 11:51.335
all: WHOO!

11:51.419 --> 11:53.421
- WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

11:53.504 --> 11:54.505
- I KNOW.
BACK UPSTAIRS.

11:54.588 --> 11:58.050
- NO, WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.302
- REALLY?
THANKS, STEPH.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.221
SO YOU'RE SAYING
WITH A GOOD FAKE I.D.,

12:02.304 --> 12:02.805
I CAN GET INTO CLUBS?

12:02.888 --> 12:04.348
both: MM-HMM.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.351
- IT'S NOT GOING WELL.

12:07.435 --> 12:10.604
COME ON, GUYS, WHEN THE KIDS
ARE AROUND, KEEP IT PG-13.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.524
GABBY, BACK UPSTAIRS.

12:13.607 --> 12:16.277
- THIS FROM THE QUEEN
OF THE MARDI GRAS BEADS?

12:16.360 --> 12:18.571
- WHAT ARE MARDI GRAS BEADS?

12:18.654 --> 12:20.698
- THEY'RE CHEAP NECKLACES
YOU GET FOR FLASHING YOUR--

12:20.781 --> 12:23.993
- TURN SIGNAL.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.327
GABBY, UPSTAIRS.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.829
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

12:26.912 --> 12:29.540
all: WHOO!

12:29.623 --> 12:30.624
- WAIT A MINUTE.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.710
DID YOU TURN ME
INTO A DRINKING GAME?

12:32.793 --> 12:33.711
- NO.
- NO.

12:33.794 --> 12:37.173
- NO.
- YES.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.507
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,

12:38.591 --> 12:40.009
TELLING A 14-YEAR-OLD
ABOUT A FAKE I.D.?

12:40.092 --> 12:42.386
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DIDN'T GET MINE UNTIL I WAS--

12:42.470 --> 12:44.388
NO, I WAS 14.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.433
AND I GOT IT FROM YOU.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.853
- WELL, THAT'S NOT HOW
WE DO THINGS IN THIS HOUSE.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.938
ANYMORE.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.233
- BOY, SATURDAY NIGHT STEPHANIE
HAS REALLY CHANGED.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.027
Gabby:
SATURDAY NIGHT STEPHANIE?

12:58.110 --> 12:59.612
- GABBY, STOP EAVESDROPPING.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.198
- I'M NOT.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.576
- AARON, BRODY,
I SAID, GO TO BED.

13:05.659 --> 13:09.205
- HOW MANY KIDS ARE IN HERE?

13:09.288 --> 13:12.875
[rattling]

13:12.958 --> 13:15.085
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HITTING HIM ON THE HEAD?

13:15.169 --> 13:18.339
- WHERE SHOULD I BE HITTING HIM?

13:18.422 --> 13:19.965
- I CAN'T EVEN FEEL IT.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.384
- COOL.
WANT TO TRY THE HAMMER?

13:22.468 --> 13:23.677
- HE CAN'T CANDLE CORN,

13:23.761 --> 13:26.138
AND YOU WANT TO HIT HIM
WITH A HAMMER?

13:26.222 --> 13:27.097
GET READY FOR BED.

13:27.181 --> 13:27.598
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

13:27.681 --> 13:30.643
all: WHOO!

13:32.603 --> 13:34.146
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.397
DID WE BRUSH OUR TEETH

13:35.481 --> 13:37.066
WITH ORGANIC,
FLUORIDE-FREE TOOTHPASTE?

13:37.149 --> 13:39.443
- YEP.
- GARGLE WITH COLLOIDAL SILVER?

13:39.527 --> 13:40.528
- UH-HUH.

13:40.611 --> 13:43.405
AND I PEED TWICE
SO I DON'T WET THE BED.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.406
- HE WETS THE BED?

13:44.490 --> 13:45.407
- IT'S COOL.

13:45.491 --> 13:49.912
I GOT HIM SLEEPING
ON NEWSPAPERS.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.790
- GOOD LOOKING OUT.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.083
GOOD NIGHT, BOYS.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.253
- AARON'S MOM,
HAVE YOU SEEN MY INHALER?

13:57.336 --> 13:58.587
- NO, BUDDY, I'M SORRY.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.338
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T
HAVE YOUR INHALER?

13:59.421 --> 14:01.757
- THEN I PANIC.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.427
- AND WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PANIC?
- THEN I NEED MY INHALER.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.556
[wheezing]

14:14.645 --> 14:15.521
- I FOUND IT.

14:15.604 --> 14:17.147
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.566
BRODY, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

14:18.649 --> 14:19.984
WE FOUND YOUR INHALER.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.987
- INHALER? WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR NIKKI'S EARRING.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.238
- OOH, THANK YOU.

14:24.321 --> 14:27.199
IF I LOST THESE,
I WOULD DIE.

14:29.076 --> 14:32.621
- I PRESENT TO YOU THE AMAZING
GIMONGOUS HUMAN EYEBALL.

14:32.705 --> 14:37.543
AND LOOK, IT EVEN CRIES.

14:37.626 --> 14:38.669
- IS THAT MY INHALER?

14:38.752 --> 14:40.462
- DID YOU USE BRODY'S INHALER?

14:40.546 --> 14:44.758
- I USED <i> AN</i> INHALER.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.302
- HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET IT OUT OF THERE?

14:46.385 --> 14:49.972
- I KNOW. I'VE SEEN THIS
A MILLION TIMES AT PARTIES.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.435
- [gasps]

14:54.518 --> 14:57.938
- WHERE'S THE CANDY?

14:58.022 --> 15:00.107
- HONEY, THAT WASN'T A PIÑATA.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.651
- IT WAS MY PROJECT,
AND YOU RUINED IT.

15:02.735 --> 15:06.322
- YOU RUINED IT
BY NOT HAVING ANY CANDY.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.198
- AARON,
THIS ISN'T ABOUT CANDY.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.242
THIS IS ABOUT A BOY
BEING ABLE TO BREATH.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.660
- EXCUSE ME,
AARON'S MOM.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.746
- HOLD ON, BRODY.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

15:13.829 --> 15:16.165
OH, RIGHT.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.375
JAMES, WE'RE GONNA MAKE
ANOTHER EYEBALL IN THE MORNING.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.586
I PROMISE.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.463
NOW WHY DON'T YOU
PUT THE BOYS TO BED,

15:22.546 --> 15:24.590
AND I'LL FIX YOU
A BOWL OF ICE CREAM.

15:24.673 --> 15:27.676
- A LITTLE ICE CREAM'S NOT GOING
TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.719
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

15:28.802 --> 15:30.971
- AN EYE FOR AN EYE.

15:33.557 --> 15:34.475
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:34.558 --> 15:36.894
YOU CAN MAKE
THAT ICE CREAM YOURSELF,

15:36.977 --> 15:39.313
AND THE BOYS CAN PUT
THEMSELVES TO BED.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.066
AARON,
LOCK YOUR DOOR.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.028
- HE WAS THE GUY
BEFORE YOUR FATHER.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.112
THE UNDERWEAR MODEL.
- [gasps]

15:47.196 --> 15:50.366
- STEPHANIE DATED
AN UNDERWEAR MODEL?

15:50.449 --> 15:53.535
- WELL,
I NEVER SAID SHE DATED HIM.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.828
- NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.288
THIS IS NOT
AN APPROPRIATE CONVERSATION

15:56.372 --> 15:56.955
FOR A 14-YEAR-OLD.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.041
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

15:59.124 --> 16:00.417
all: WHOO!

16:00.501 --> 16:02.544
- STOP THAT.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.172
- LIGHTEN UP, STEPH.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.507
- YEAH, LIGHTEN UP, STEPH.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.050
- LIGHTEN UP?

16:08.133 --> 16:10.761
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

16:10.844 --> 16:12.054
YOU KNOW,
EVER SINCE YOUR DAD LEFT,

16:12.137 --> 16:14.431
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING
BUT CHALLENGE ME.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.974
- AND YOU'VE BEEN SO UPTIGHT.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.101
- OH, I'LL SHOW YOU UPTIGHT.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.728
YOU'RE GROUNDED.
- I'M ALREADY GROUNDED.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.355
- AND NOW YOU'RE
DOUBLE-GROUNDED.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.773
GO TO YOUR ROOM,
YOUNG LADY,

16:22.856 --> 16:24.358
AND DON'T COME OUT
UNTIL YOUR DAD GETS HOME.

16:24.441 --> 16:27.403
- GLADLY, 'CAUSE THEN I DON'T
HAVE TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.366
- GABBY, WAIT--

16:32.449 --> 16:34.034
- OH, SHE'LL BE FINE.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.412
OH, I GOT TO SHOW YOU
THESE BOOTS I FOUND.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.956
WORTH EVERY DIME OF MY 401(k).

16:40.874 --> 16:42.418
- I BETTER GO TALK TO HER.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.086
- AGAIN, STEPHANIE?

16:44.169 --> 16:46.046
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA HAVE
A BIG GIRLFRIEND WEEKEND,

16:46.130 --> 16:47.756
BUT ALL YOU'VE DONE
IS CHASE AFTER KIDS.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.885
- I'VE COUNTED SIX SO FAR.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.762
- I'M BEING A MOM.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.432
- PLEASE, YOU'RE JUST DOING A
BUNCH OF PAIN-IN-THE-BUTT STUFF:

16:56.515 --> 16:59.059
STUPID PROJECTS,
LOCKING DOWN A TEENAGER,

16:59.143 --> 17:03.272
WATCHING SOMEBODY ELSE'S
WEIRD LITTLE BOY.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.272
THAT'S NOT BEING A MOM.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.941
THAT'S BEING A BABYSITTER.

17:06.023 --> 17:07.526
- YEAH, BEING A MOM
IS DEALING WITH, LIKE,

17:07.608 --> 17:11.488
A GIRL WHO'S FALSELY ACCUSED
OF MURDERING HER BALLET TEACHER

17:11.571 --> 17:15.534
AND ENDS UP
IN A MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.202
- THAT'S A PLOT TO A TV MOVIE.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.829
- I GUESS IT COULD BE.

17:19.913 --> 17:22.915
- NO, IT'S THE ACTUAL PLOT
TO A TV MOVIE.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.792
- SHE WAS TRIED AS AN ADULT.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.627
[all gasp]

17:26.712 --> 17:27.796
- YOU GUYS DON'T GET IT.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.467
THIS "PAIN-IN-THE-BUTT" STUFF
IS PARENTING.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.510
JAMES NEVER GETS EXCITED
ABOUT HOMEWORK.

17:33.594 --> 17:37.389
AND THAT LITTLE KID IS THE FIRST
FRIEND AARON'S MADE AT SCHOOL.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.974
AND GABBY?

17:39.057 --> 17:40.934
WHEN I WAS JUST DATING CHARLIE,
SHE AND I WERE PALS.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.353
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IT'S A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.815
AND, YES, WE ARE STILL
FIGURING OUR THING OUT,

17:46.899 --> 17:49.151
BUT IT'S WORTH IT.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.487
I LIKED BEING HER FRIEND,

17:51.570 --> 17:53.697
BUT I LOVE BEING HER MOM.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.993
- WOW.

17:58.076 --> 18:01.121
I AM SO NEVER HAVING KIDS.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.916
- THEY TRIED THAT GIRL
AS AN ADULT?

18:03.999 --> 18:04.458
HOW OLD WAS SHE?

18:04.541 --> 18:07.002
- SEVEN.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.378
IT WAS TEXAS.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.716
- HONEY, I'M SORRY.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.219
YOU ALREADY HAVE ALL THESE KIDS,

18:15.302 --> 18:17.137
AND HERE I AM
BEING A BRAT MYSELF.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.348
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
MAKES A GREAT MOM,

18:19.431 --> 18:20.974
BUT I KNOW I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU CARE

18:21.058 --> 18:24.770
THIS MUCH ABOUT ANYTHING.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.855
STEPH?

18:26.939 --> 18:27.856
ARE YOU MAD?

18:27.940 --> 18:31.652
- [snores]

18:32.986 --> 18:35.572
- HMM, WAKE UP, SLEEPY HEAD.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.699
- I'M UP.

18:37.783 --> 18:38.992
OKAY,
LET'S KEEP THIS PARTY GOING.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.452
WHERE'S JENNY?

18:40.536 --> 18:42.496
JAMES, LET'S BUILD YOUR EYEBALL.
IS BRODY STILL ALIVE?

18:42.579 --> 18:43.997
[gasps]

18:44.081 --> 18:46.125
I HAVE TO CLEAN THE HOUSE
BEFORE YOU GET HOME.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.376
- I AM HOME,

18:47.459 --> 18:49.878
AND THE PLACE LOOKS GREAT.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.672
- HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

18:51.755 --> 18:53.715
I'VE BEEN ASLEEP FOR--

18:53.799 --> 18:55.634
12 HOURS?

18:55.717 --> 18:56.677
WHO CLEANED UP?

18:56.760 --> 18:57.719
- I DID.

18:57.803 --> 18:58.720
I ALSO GOT JENNY PACKED,

18:58.804 --> 19:00.180
HELPED JAMES
REBUILD HIS PROJECT,

19:00.264 --> 19:03.851
AND CALLED BRODY'S MOM 12 TIMES
BEFORE SHE CAME TO GET HIM.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.186
- HE SURVIVED THE WEEKEND?

19:06.270 --> 19:06.979
- OH, YEAH,
THERE WAS A SMALL ISSUE

19:07.062 --> 19:09.356
THAT REQUIRED HIS EPIPEN,

19:09.439 --> 19:10.315
BUT WE WORKED IT OUT.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.403
- THANK YOU.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.739
- EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE
A HUGE PAIN THIS WEEKEND,

19:17.823 --> 19:21.326
I KNOW WE'RE STILL
"FIGURING OUR THING OUT."

19:21.410 --> 19:22.995
AND I LIKED BEING YOUR FRIEND,

19:23.078 --> 19:26.790
BUT I LOVE THIS WAY TOO.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.709
- STOP EAVESDROPPING.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.752
- I'M NOT.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.004
[both laugh]

19:32.087 --> 19:32.921
- AW.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.632
- AW, LOOK AT THIS.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.926
MY LITTLE GABBY IS GROWING UP.

19:38.010 --> 19:38.677
WELL,
SOMETIMES A LITTLE GROUNDING

19:38.760 --> 19:41.930
IS ALL IT TAKES.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.349
I GUESS DAD DOES KNOW
A THING OR TWO ABOUT PARENTING.

19:47.185 --> 19:49.146
- I THINK HE'S BEING ONE TOO,

19:49.229 --> 19:50.564
BUT DON'T SAY IT,

19:50.647 --> 19:52.357
OR WE'LL BOTH GET GROUNDED.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.070
- SO THEN,
AFTER I FINISHED MY CONSULT,

19:57.154 --> 19:58.530
WE ALL HEADED TO THE BEACH.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.115
- WOW. FUN.

20:00.198 --> 20:04.953
- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN,
BUT IT WAS SWIMSUITS OPTIONAL.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.290
PICTURE A 300-POUND
CARDIAC NURSE JUST...

20:08.373 --> 20:10.250
FROLICKING.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.209
[doorbell rings]

20:11.293 --> 20:12.502
- SHOULD I BE JEALOUS?

20:12.586 --> 20:15.714
- WELL, TO BE HONEST,
I DIDN'T LOOK AWAY.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.758
- [laughs]

20:17.841 --> 20:20.010
- HI, AARON'S MOM.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.094
- BRODY, YOU'RE BACK.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.305
WHY ARE YOU BACK?

20:23.388 --> 20:26.600
- I BROUGHT TWO INHALERS
THIS TIME.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.310
- OH, NO YOU DON'T,
BRODY'S MOM.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.394
GET BACK HERE!

20:29.478 --> 20:30.270
[tires screech]
