00:50.963 --> 00:53.618
You know, people pay me a lot
to hack into things.

00:53.662 --> 00:56.969
Face and Friends usually
isn't at the top of the list.

00:57.013 --> 00:58.841
I mean, why are you
so interested in some boring

00:58.884 --> 01:00.582
random ass housewife anyway?

01:02.410 --> 01:05.239
She's not boring, she's perfect.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.067
Yeah, sure.

01:07.110 --> 01:08.677
Whatever.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.722
Look, I'll send you
the login information.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.550
That'll be 500 bucks.

01:21.342 --> 01:22.778
Pleasure doing business with ya.

01:22.821 --> 01:24.649
If you need
to Faces and Friend stalk

01:24.693 --> 01:27.565
any other strangers,
you got my number.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.514
Stella Armstrong
is not a stranger.

02:48.516 --> 02:51.562
Uh... Stay here,
I'll be right back.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.657
What're you doing?

02:59.701 --> 03:02.399
I wanted to tell you,
I found my real mom.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.749
You gotta stop this.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.970
I thought you would care.
You said you loved me.

03:08.013 --> 03:11.191
- You're too clingy.
- I miss you, Oliver.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.366
You take everything too far.

03:12.409 --> 03:14.846
You're too... much.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.848
- I could do better.
- I need my space.

03:16.892 --> 03:19.199
Yeah, you really need
to back off.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.939
You need your space, huh?

03:20.983 --> 03:22.724
Well, how come you already
have a new girlfriend?

03:22.767 --> 03:25.466
This isn't cool, Blake.
We're over.

03:25.509 --> 03:28.643
- Done.
- I'm sorry.

03:28.686 --> 03:31.515
Please don't leave me.
Please!

04:08.639 --> 04:10.424
Now, wait a minute.
There's more back there.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.295
What do you think?

04:12.339 --> 04:13.688
Me? You?

04:14.732 --> 04:15.733
Little bit.

04:32.707 --> 04:33.882
What do you think?

04:33.925 --> 04:35.579
I think it was good

04:35.623 --> 04:37.755
the second time
you wiped it down.

04:37.799 --> 04:42.412
Hey. When'd you get home?

04:42.456 --> 04:44.284
A few minutes ago, long enough
to wonder if the boys

04:44.327 --> 04:45.850
have officially driven
you insane.

04:45.894 --> 04:47.896
No, no, no,
not the boys. No.

04:47.939 --> 04:48.984
That's right, that's right.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.028
The big charity event meeting

04:50.072 --> 04:51.334
is tonight, right?

04:51.378 --> 04:53.467
You feel good?
Are you ready?

04:53.510 --> 04:56.383
No, no, no. I mean, convincing
the yoga pants posse

04:56.426 --> 05:00.256
to raise money for charity
is not gonna be easy.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.127
Well, just be honest.
I mean, tell them this town

05:02.171 --> 05:06.218
doesn't need another
replica canyon or a grandstand.

05:06.262 --> 05:08.220
Oh, honey, why don't you try
to tell them?

05:08.264 --> 05:10.135
I mean, come on,
we've been here for what

05:10.179 --> 05:11.920
almost a year?

05:11.963 --> 05:13.617
And they still treat me
like an outsider.

05:16.403 --> 05:20.015
Listen, I know you can do this.
Think about your mom.

05:20.058 --> 05:23.018
I do. Every day.

05:23.061 --> 05:27.196
It's just... Queen bee Meredith,
she's intimidating.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.590
Well, you're intimidating.

05:29.633 --> 05:33.811
- Right.
- Smart, sexy, amazing.

05:33.855 --> 05:36.031
- I can't stand up to her.
- Then go around her.

05:37.511 --> 05:40.122
Huh! Oye! Ha!

05:40.165 --> 05:41.863
What do you think these are for?

05:41.906 --> 05:43.517
Oh, really? Oh, okay.
Hey, hey, buddy.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.561
Come to dada.

05:44.605 --> 05:47.738
So... What I figured

05:47.782 --> 05:49.610
from the last meeting...

05:51.220 --> 05:52.613
It's okay, I'll be right there.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.789
Maybe half of the women
will side with me

05:54.832 --> 05:58.227
or rather against Meredith.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.968
The deciding vote
is gonna be this woman

06:00.011 --> 06:02.187
who's fairly new to the group.

06:02.231 --> 06:04.015
And she loves my brownies.

06:04.059 --> 06:06.104
Well, I love your brownies.
Let me get a little piece.

06:06.148 --> 06:08.411
Hey!

06:08.455 --> 06:10.326
How do you think I got you
to propose?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.980
Oh, okay.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.548
Well, it was that,
and your body.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.117
- How you doin', sweet pea?
- I know.

06:19.161 --> 06:23.731
If it weren't for William Spry,
our founder

06:23.774 --> 06:25.776
we would be living somewhere
in Rockland.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.909
I mean, could you imagine?

06:27.952 --> 06:30.651
So, I think it's about time
that we erect a statue

06:30.694 --> 06:33.958
to honor our beloved founder.

06:34.002 --> 06:37.745
So, if there aren't any other
fundraising proposals

06:37.788 --> 06:39.616
let's put it to a vote,
and make it official.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.010
Um, actually I have

06:42.053 --> 06:43.794
something I'd like to propose.

06:43.838 --> 06:46.710
Stella, you haven't had
a definitive opinion

06:46.754 --> 06:48.277
on anything this whole year

06:48.320 --> 06:50.540
and now you have a proposal.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.847
I can't wait to hear it.

06:52.890 --> 06:57.286
Um... There is a pancreatic
c-cancer research fund

06:57.329 --> 06:58.679
that I've looked into,
and I think

06:58.722 --> 06:59.723
that they would appreciate

06:59.767 --> 07:01.638
anything that we could raise.

07:01.682 --> 07:04.075
Well, any charity
would appreciate

07:04.119 --> 07:05.816
a very sizable donation.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.340
What makes this fund
worthy of our focus?

07:08.384 --> 07:10.168
My mother died
of pancreatic cancer.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.523
Fine.

07:16.566 --> 07:20.701
We have Stella's suggestion,
and we have mine.

07:20.744 --> 07:23.878
So, let's put it to a vote.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.662
All in favor of the statue.

07:30.624 --> 07:33.931
And of cancer research.

07:40.634 --> 07:41.852
Georgia.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.288
Georgia.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.725
Georgia!

07:44.768 --> 07:46.248
It's up to you.

07:46.291 --> 07:47.467
Who are you vot...

07:49.860 --> 07:51.471
Do you even know what it takes

07:51.514 --> 07:52.907
to put together an event
of this magnitude?

07:52.950 --> 07:54.299
I don't even know
if we're gonna be able

07:54.343 --> 07:56.214
to find a venue
this late in the season.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.042
And I don't want to burden you
with that much work

07:58.086 --> 08:00.262
so, I was hoping that I could
take point on the planning.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.571
Have you ever planned
an event like this before?

08:04.614 --> 08:06.921
No. No, I haven't.

08:06.964 --> 08:09.401
But I was thinking we could
just have it at my house.

08:13.580 --> 08:17.627
Oh. Oh... Stella.

08:17.671 --> 08:20.891
I just... I just think
that your house

08:20.935 --> 08:24.242
is maybe a little bit, uh...

08:24.286 --> 08:26.157
underwhelming.

08:26.201 --> 08:29.944
Um... I-I think it can work.

08:29.987 --> 08:32.554
Okay. Senators, judges

08:32.599 --> 08:36.211
members of Fortune 500 companies
attend our soirees.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.474
And we depend on them
to keep on coming back

08:38.518 --> 08:41.999
year after year after year
and open up their wallets.

08:42.043 --> 08:45.394
I mean, we cannot afford
to embarrass ourselves.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.222
I agree.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.703
Which is why I will drop
a proposal for you to look at.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.748
You can come by the house
at the end of the week

08:51.792 --> 08:55.273
to evaluate it, and if you still
think it's not gonna work

08:55.317 --> 08:56.927
we can come up
with other options.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.929
Fine.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.844
I will be by at the end
of the week to evaluate

09:00.888 --> 09:04.631
whatever proposal you can manage
to scramble together.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.067
Okay?

09:38.752 --> 09:42.538
"Fellow mommies
busy looking for help."

09:42.582 --> 09:43.887
Hm.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.725
- Hey! Have a good night.
- Thanks. You, too.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.597
Oh, don't forget, you're opening
up in the morning.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.381
Yes, first thing tomorrow.
Bright and early. I can't wait.

09:59.424 --> 10:00.338
Bye.

10:04.386 --> 10:06.562
Hey. Blake, right?

10:06.606 --> 10:09.434
I just wanna make sure we're
cool. I don't want any trouble.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.828
Oh, yeah, of course not.
Nobody wants any trouble.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.917
Just like no one wants
to lose the love of their life.

10:13.961 --> 10:17.268
Whatever happened between
you and Oliver, I'm out of it.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.183
I'll stay away from you,
you stay away from me.

10:19.227 --> 10:23.057
Believe me, Kristen, I've not
given you another thought.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.841
I'm just here for the Wi-Fi.

10:53.217 --> 10:56.960
Oh. It is nice to see some
friendly faces.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.179
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.876
Hello, baby.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.052
And where is this guy's
slightly younger brother?

11:02.096 --> 11:03.401
Oh, Andy went down
without a problem

11:03.445 --> 11:05.665
but this little guy...

11:05.708 --> 11:07.492
Did you drive around the block?

11:07.536 --> 11:10.060
Yes, we drove around
for like 45 minutes.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.193
He's basically been crying
the whole time you've been gone.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.717
- Aw! Let me see.
- Okay, go to mommy.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.719
Come here, munchkin.

11:16.763 --> 11:20.549
Maybe mommy's good news will,
woo, make you feel better. Hm?

11:20.592 --> 11:22.986
So... Guess who's plannin'

11:23.030 --> 11:25.815
Westport Society's
next charity event.

11:25.859 --> 11:28.252
- You got it? That's great.
- Totally nailed it.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.124
You know,
you're gonna be amazing.

11:30.167 --> 11:32.213
Well, Meredith thinks otherwise

11:32.256 --> 11:34.606
but I'm gonna try
to prove her wrong.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.217
You know, there's one...

11:36.260 --> 11:38.610
Actually I think there
are two little problems.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.308
How're you gonna plan this event
when you're, you're busy

11:40.351 --> 11:41.701
with these two little boys?

11:41.744 --> 11:44.660
- Wait, we have two boys?
- Hmm.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.835
Did I tell you
I love your sarcasm?

11:45.879 --> 11:48.751
Mm. Yeah.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.579
What am I gonna do?

11:52.276 --> 11:53.930
You know,
it's not insurmountable.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.584
I know you don't wanna hear
this, but maybe we can

11:55.627 --> 11:57.673
just revisit
the whole nanny conversation.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.763
Oh, no, no, no. I-I'm not gonna
let a stranger raise our kids.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.504
They're not raising,
they're helping out.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.332
Look, I just want you
to have the time and the energy

12:04.375 --> 12:06.769
to do the best event you can,
and-and to do that

12:06.813 --> 12:08.336
you're gonna need some help
with the boys.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.772
Uh, see, Andy agrees with me.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.340
Oh.

12:12.383 --> 12:15.560
Okay, if I say yes

12:15.604 --> 12:17.171
are you gonna get all smug?

12:17.214 --> 12:18.955
Absolutely.

12:18.999 --> 12:22.132
In that case,
you get to change Andy

12:22.176 --> 12:25.266
while I put the word out
on Face and Friends.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.616
I'd like blonde, Swedish.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.487
I'll make sure he is.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.577
Did you hear
what mommy did to me?

12:32.621 --> 12:34.405
She turned it around.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.081
Oh, my God!

13:00.605 --> 13:02.956
Wow.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.958
It looks like you're
gonna have to call a cab.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.264
What the hell is wrong with you?

13:07.308 --> 13:09.223
- Me?
- You did this.

13:09.266 --> 13:10.267
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.834
Like hell you don't.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.270
You know I saved up
for four years to buy

13:13.314 --> 13:15.011
that car and you ruined it?

13:15.055 --> 13:17.100
Aw, why would I ruin something

13:17.144 --> 13:19.407
that means so much to you?

13:19.450 --> 13:23.150
- You're crazy.
- And you're lashing out.

13:23.193 --> 13:27.632
I get it, it's horrible when
our personal space gets invaded.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.591
I really hope you find
whoever did this.

13:39.079 --> 13:41.385
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, but you're tired, baby.

13:41.429 --> 13:43.648
Here, I'll take you.
No, no, no.

13:43.692 --> 13:46.738
Okay, okay, okay.
Oh, that's not gonna work today.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.436
No, we're not ready for a nap.

13:48.479 --> 13:49.567
Are you hungry?

13:49.611 --> 13:51.439
Okay.

13:51.482 --> 13:54.529
Alright, okay.
Let's do this. How 'bout this?

13:54.572 --> 13:56.400
How about some food?
Did you want some food?

13:56.444 --> 13:57.706
Aren't you hungry?

13:58.576 --> 13:59.969
Hah!

14:00.013 --> 14:02.580
What a good boy.
What a good boy.

14:02.624 --> 14:05.018
Ha! There you go.
Okay, w-w-w-wait, one second.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.976
One second.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.630
Okay.

14:12.939 --> 14:16.899
Oh, Meredith. It is so good
to hear from you.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.859
Is it? Is everything
alright over there?

14:19.902 --> 14:21.599
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure.
Just, you know...

14:21.643 --> 14:24.211
Fussy baby, but I'm sure you
can remember those days.

14:24.254 --> 14:27.083
Well, if you can't keep control
of your household

14:27.127 --> 14:29.607
I am having reservations
about putting you in charge

14:29.651 --> 14:30.957
of our charity gala.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.829
Uh... No, no.
I'm a great juggler.

14:35.222 --> 14:36.876
Is that a joke?

14:36.919 --> 14:38.399
I can never tell with you.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.749
Anyways, this event
is no laughing matter.

14:40.792 --> 14:43.099
Georgia, Gwendolyn, and I
will be over on Friday

14:43.143 --> 14:44.840
to inspect your house,
so, if you could

14:44.884 --> 14:46.842
alert your gate guard,
that would be appreciated.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.191
Ugh! Oh, no no.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.932
There's no, um,
there's no guards.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.934
And you can just come over,
no problem.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.371
- There's no gate guard?
- No, no, no. There's no gate.

14:54.415 --> 14:55.938
So, we figured
the guard wasn't necessary.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.506
Again, I'm not amused.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.595
And if you can get me
that proposal you promised me

15:00.638 --> 15:01.857
by tonight,
that would be great as well.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.467
Wait, you mean, tonight?

15:03.511 --> 15:05.513
I thought I had till
the end of the week.

15:05.556 --> 15:06.906
Well, I'm gonna need
to see it tonight.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.777
That is, if you can manage it.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.780
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I-I got, yep,
I can manage it, no problem.

15:11.823 --> 15:15.958
Great. Well, I'll let you
get back to your fussy baby.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.786
See you this weekend.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.093
Yeah.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.225
Okay.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.053
Oh, honey.
No, no, not yet.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.926
Oh, what now?

15:26.969 --> 15:28.144
Coming!

15:33.106 --> 15:34.846
Hey! I'm Blake.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.370
We talked
on the phone yesterday.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.328
Oh, uh, yeah.

15:38.372 --> 15:40.548
I totally forgot.
We have an interview.

15:40.591 --> 15:41.941
Uh, you can see
why I need a nanny.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.030
- Yeah.
- Um, please come in.

15:44.073 --> 15:44.944
Thanks.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.424
Yes.

15:50.775 --> 15:53.169
Um, I-I didn't have
any green tea.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.649
- Hope black's okay?
- Oh, absolutely.

15:54.692 --> 15:57.521
I'm easy to please.

15:57.565 --> 16:01.264
So, uh, where did you say that
you heard about the job again?

16:01.308 --> 16:03.919
Shelley Matthews.
She and my parents go way back.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.313
She said that you were
asking on Face and Friends.

16:06.356 --> 16:08.054
Yes, Shelley's a great friend.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.969
I'm just gonna have
to give her a reference call.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.840
Oh, no, I have all
my references in here.

16:13.842 --> 16:15.191
Oh.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.540
Wow!

16:16.584 --> 16:18.455
- You came prepared.
- Yeah.

16:18.499 --> 16:21.067
Oh, and I also have a resume
for your consideration.

16:25.288 --> 16:26.811
Blake Noland.

16:26.855 --> 16:27.856
Is that German?

16:27.899 --> 16:29.684
It's Swedish.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.513
Oh... Swedish.

16:32.556 --> 16:37.300
So, then, you must be, like,
an excellent lutefisk chef.

16:37.344 --> 16:41.696
Well, I can cook a
mean stinky fish if you like.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.567
Well, I'm actually more than
happy to do all the cooking

16:43.611 --> 16:46.048
and the cleaning
and... laundry

16:46.092 --> 16:48.616
scheduling, anything
you need, really.

16:48.659 --> 16:51.488
Wow! I appreciate
your enthusiasm.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.885
Yeah, you have a lot of
experience for someone so young.

16:56.928 --> 17:01.542
Yeah, well, I've had
to support myself my whole life.

17:01.585 --> 17:05.328
My parents are, um,
self-absorbed.

17:05.372 --> 17:07.722
Mm. I'm sorry.

17:07.765 --> 17:11.030
If you have a kid,
you should be there for them.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.988
Well, I can see that
you're there for these two.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.166
I'm sorry.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.604
Considering you're so busy.

17:20.647 --> 17:23.999
I just, um,
I try my best, I just...

17:24.042 --> 17:25.521
I have my hands full right now

17:25.566 --> 17:27.133
since I've decided
to plan this charity event

17:27.175 --> 17:28.612
for pancreatic cancer research.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.136
Oh, wow! That's so cool.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.920
I'm pre-med.

17:31.963 --> 17:35.489
Well, I'm taking a year off
to save up money.

17:35.532 --> 17:38.492
But, who knows? Maybe it'll be
me who finds a cure one day.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.407
That would be a dream come true.

17:43.453 --> 17:46.021
This is gonna
sound crazy, but...

17:46.065 --> 17:47.588
do I know you from somewhere?

17:47.631 --> 17:49.764
'Cause, I don't know,
there just, you just...

17:49.807 --> 17:53.246
Have we met before?
You seem familiar.

17:53.289 --> 17:56.118
Maybe we knew each other
in a past life.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.338
Well, in that case,
it's nice to see you again.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.211
And there we go.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.821
Oh, no, here, let me.

18:04.909 --> 18:07.303
Uh, okay.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.262
Okay, he's been colic ever since
we brought him home

18:09.305 --> 18:11.046
from the hospital, so, probably
gonna just continue to cry

18:11.090 --> 18:12.830
no matter what you do.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.791
You're amazing.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.140
Guess it's my gift.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.316
I'm just really good
with babies.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.405
Uh, you're better than good.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.146
You're like a baby whisperer.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.930
Huh! What do you think?

18:25.974 --> 18:27.367
- Da-da-da-da.
- Ya.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.195
My goodness.

18:29.238 --> 18:31.545
If your references check out,
when can you start?

19:00.443 --> 19:02.271
Hello, this is Mrs. Brown.

19:08.799 --> 19:11.193
Oh, Blake Noland.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.848
Yes, I can recommend
her very highly.

19:13.891 --> 19:16.024
She is, uh, such a darling girl.

19:20.681 --> 19:23.858
There's something,
comforting about her, you know.

19:23.901 --> 19:26.121
Something familiar.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.471
- Hmm, that's a plus.
- And she's great with the boys.

19:28.515 --> 19:30.952
It's like she
spoke their language.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.084
- Bigger plus.
- Her referrals checked out.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.782
Gigantic plus.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.566
So, should we hire her?

19:41.310 --> 19:43.573
Oh, honey,
I know you're nervous.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.967
It's a big deal.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.230
You've been the only one
watching the boys up until now.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.536
But you know what I think?

19:49.579 --> 19:50.928
You should trust
your instincts, okay.

19:50.972 --> 19:53.061
Uh, you've always been on point.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.019
Always. The whole time
I've known you.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.630
Alright, so what do you think?

19:56.673 --> 19:58.458
Alright, let's hire her.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.634
It's gonna be a good thing.

20:00.677 --> 20:03.245
We're hiring her.
It's official.

20:03.289 --> 20:06.292
Are you sure? Because I could
talk about this for hours.

20:06.335 --> 20:07.728
Okay, I'll stop.

20:07.771 --> 20:08.946
Okay.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.121
Thank you.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.820
I aim to please.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.086
Hey, let me help you with those.

20:18.129 --> 20:20.175
Thanks.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.525
- Tanner.
- Blake.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.484
Can't tell you how happy we
are to have you here, Blake.

20:24.527 --> 20:27.356
Yeah, I'm really
happy to be here.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.750
Wow! What do you have in here,
boulders?

20:29.793 --> 20:31.665
Oh, close enough,
that's my kettlebell.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.319
Working out helps me
to de-stress

20:33.362 --> 20:35.364
when the whole pre-med thing
gets to be a bit much.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.497
Oh yeah, I remember those days.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.063
Take Orgo yet?

20:42.284 --> 20:43.938
Oh, this could be
my old roommate.

20:43.981 --> 20:46.245
It's kind of an emergency,
I'm sorry.

20:46.288 --> 20:47.158
Okay.

20:55.384 --> 20:58.300
Yeah, organic chemistry
nearly killed me.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.650
Yeah, me too. Ah!
I'll show you inside.

21:00.694 --> 21:01.782
Thanks.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.180
It's right there
in front of you.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.575
Can't promise that two baby boys
will be any

21:12.619 --> 21:14.360
less stressful than college.

21:14.403 --> 21:17.058
So, I'm sure you'll still need
your workouts.

21:17.101 --> 21:20.148
I'll keep my
kettlebell close then.

21:20.191 --> 21:21.367
Blake.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.020
Welcome to your home.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.892
Thanks. I love it.

21:24.935 --> 21:26.502
Uh, it gets a little chilly.

21:26.546 --> 21:27.895
Especially on this
side of the house.

21:27.938 --> 21:30.158
So I brought you
a little something extra.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.986
- To keep you cozy.
- Thanks.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.988
Stella's mother made it for her,
it was her last gift

21:34.031 --> 21:35.294
before she passed away.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.904
Oh, I can't accept it.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.732
No, you can.
Yeah, I mean, it's special.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.386
But, so are you.

21:40.429 --> 21:41.952
Thank you so much.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.128
That's my cue.

21:44.172 --> 21:46.479
Oh, isn't it mine now?

21:46.522 --> 21:48.350
Yes, it is. Okay.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.743
Thanks.

21:49.786 --> 21:52.136
I guess, uh,
we'll go on a stroll.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.921
- Uh, okay.
- Hmm.

21:53.964 --> 21:56.184
Might as well take advantage
of it while I'm here.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.099
Oh, and, um...

21:58.142 --> 22:01.320
I also brought a couple
of stuffed bears for the boys.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.452
Oh, they're sweet.

22:03.496 --> 22:05.236
Yeah, I'll go give 'em
to them now.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.720
I could get used to this.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.026
Me too.

22:17.901 --> 22:20.034
You know what?
Let's take that walk.

22:20.077 --> 22:21.688
Love to.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.281
Oh, my God.

22:50.325 --> 22:52.283
Nicky is such a
little stinker, yes.

22:52.327 --> 22:53.894
But, come on,
when he gave you that kiss

22:53.937 --> 22:55.025
did it not melt your heart?

22:55.069 --> 22:56.853
Yeah.

22:56.897 --> 22:59.726
It did, his kisses are better
than my ex-boyfriend.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.380
- Ha ha.
- Oh-ho, whoa!

23:01.423 --> 23:03.773
Hate to break up
the girls' party, everyone.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.732
Oh, something smells
good in here.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.604
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

23:10.258 --> 23:11.172
- Hey stranger.
- Hi, Stella.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.434
- Oh.
- Oh.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.653
How was the game?

23:13.696 --> 23:14.958
- Argh.
- You know, the usual.

23:15.002 --> 23:17.352
- He annihilated me.
- Oh.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.573
Hey, I go away for two weeks,
and you guys adopt a teenager?

23:20.616 --> 23:23.053
Oh, no, I'm 20,
I-I just, look really young.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.577
This is our new nanny, Blake.

23:24.620 --> 23:25.926
- Nice to meet ya.
- Nice to meet you too.

23:25.969 --> 23:27.580
Walt's Tanner's oldest friend.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.233
Uh, and I'm a detective, so...

23:29.277 --> 23:32.106
No parties while
the boss is outta town.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.455
You got it, officer.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.196
Actually, that's Detective Tyler
to you.

23:38.678 --> 23:39.940
Oh, you know what,
you should try

23:39.983 --> 23:41.115
Blake's marinara sauce.

23:41.158 --> 23:42.682
- Oh, yeah? Alright.
- Yeah.

23:42.725 --> 23:43.944
I'm starving.

23:48.122 --> 23:49.863
Wow, it's, it's amazing.

23:51.386 --> 23:52.996
You know, babe,
you are good, no, great.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.563
So, so many things, but this...

23:54.607 --> 23:56.478
This is amazing.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.349
You guys, f...
Uh, forget about the sauce.

23:58.393 --> 23:59.742
Don't you wanna know
what's in the box?

23:59.786 --> 24:01.048
Yes, okay.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.446
Oh.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.578
More old, what? Crap.

24:09.622 --> 24:11.624
Isn't your collection
big enough already?

24:11.667 --> 24:13.843
Oh, it's never big enough.

24:13.887 --> 24:16.019
- That would be a replica.
- A replica?

24:16.063 --> 24:20.241
Is a replica worthy of the new
chief of cardiothoracic surgery?

24:20.284 --> 24:23.723
Um, I'm all for supporting
Tanner's promotion.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.507
But we can't have
a gun in the house with boys.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.509
Especially not one
that comes with bullets.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.642
Honey, this gun
is 156 years old.

24:29.685 --> 24:31.078
I'm pretty sure
it doesn't even shoot anymore.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.123
Yeah, plus the bullets
aren't in the gun.

24:33.167 --> 24:36.692
I mean, if the babies can find
it, load it, point, and fire it

24:36.736 --> 24:38.172
I'm thinking a gun in the house

24:38.215 --> 24:41.001
is the least of your worries.

24:41.044 --> 24:42.611
Alright, we can
discuss this later

24:42.655 --> 24:44.091
but can you get this
out of here before Meredith

24:44.134 --> 24:46.267
comes over,
because I don't think

24:46.310 --> 24:48.443
cowboy chic
is the style we're going for.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.097
Okay.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.620
Fair enough.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.274
- Let's find a spot for this.
- Yeah.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.319
Oh, uh, Stella, before I forget

24:55.363 --> 24:58.061
did you and Juliana set a time?

24:58.105 --> 24:59.498
We did.
We're meeting next week.

24:59.541 --> 25:02.109
Oh, that's great, thank you.

25:02.152 --> 25:04.459
- Who's Juliana?
- Oh, that's my kid.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.895
Stella's nice enough
to help her out

25:05.939 --> 25:09.725
with her college applications.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.510
Ooh, don't you have
a lot on your plate though?

25:11.553 --> 25:13.686
Oh, I always have time
for Juliana.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.470
She's like a daughter to me.

25:21.215 --> 25:23.260
I really love the gun, man.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.175
I just don't know if I have
any more room for it in here.

25:25.219 --> 25:26.655
Ha.

25:26.699 --> 25:28.527
Yeah.

25:28.570 --> 25:32.661
So, uh, Blake, she seems nice.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.924
Although,
pretty risky hirin' her.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.536
What's the risk? She's like the
sweetest kid you'll ever meet.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.754
Yeah.

25:38.798 --> 25:40.495
She's easy on the eyes too.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.497
That's a risk.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.151
I'm old enough
to be her dad, man.

25:44.194 --> 25:45.718
- It's not cool.
- Hey, man.

25:45.761 --> 25:46.980
I know you're not
that kinda guy.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.764
It's just, you know...

25:48.808 --> 25:51.680
I seen movies.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.682
Alright, alright, well,
unlike the movies...

25:53.726 --> 25:54.683
- I love my wife.
- Hey.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.119
Alright.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.773
Alright, I surrender.

25:57.817 --> 25:59.470
You're one of the good ones,
Tanner.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.385
Uh-huh. I wish I could say
the same about you.

26:03.257 --> 26:05.651
- Yeah.
- You got me.

26:05.694 --> 26:07.435
- Yeah, I'm bad, huh?
- Yeah.

26:07.478 --> 26:08.523
Cool, man.

26:11.134 --> 26:15.617
- You sure I can't help you?
- Mm-hmm, yeah. I got this.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.314
I wish everything
in my life were this easy.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.797
You're still worried about
Meredith's visit this weekend?

26:23.886 --> 26:27.890
Yeah, you know...

26:27.934 --> 26:29.588
You remember the mean girls
in junior high?

26:29.631 --> 26:31.590
Meredith is what they grow into.

26:33.069 --> 26:35.724
She honestly scares me.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.465
Oh, well, you don't have
to be scared of anyone.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.206
You're like Superwoman.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.122
Thanks.

26:42.165 --> 26:46.343
But, to know her, she's perfect.

26:46.387 --> 26:48.345
Everybody has their secrets.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.305
Oh.
I'll set the table.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.892
Personal details
of Meredith Woodley.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.720
Let's see what
your skeletons are.

27:39.832 --> 27:43.183
Thank you, WhoShesBeenTexting.com.

27:43.226 --> 27:45.446
Now I know exactly
what your skeleton is

27:45.489 --> 27:48.057
and he has a Lamborghini.

27:48.101 --> 27:49.319
Nice neighborhood.

27:57.545 --> 27:58.764
Bingo.

28:39.152 --> 28:41.937
So, this is

28:41.981 --> 28:44.548
Um...

28:44.592 --> 28:46.681
Well, there's, uh,
no room for a buffet.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.509
So, let's start there.

28:48.552 --> 28:51.512
Actually, I thought we could put
the buffet... right here.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.949
We're feeding a hundred people

28:53.993 --> 28:55.690
not twenty.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.692
Okay, alright.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.781
What about back there? That,
that can be even better, right?

28:59.825 --> 29:03.698
Then you'll lose what little
lounging space we have.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.439
Yeah, this is not gonna work.

29:05.482 --> 29:07.746
- Okay, um...
- No, no. No, no.

29:07.789 --> 29:10.052
I think that we should go back
to our original idea

29:10.096 --> 29:13.186
of having the founder's
statue brunch. Am I right?

29:13.229 --> 29:16.363
And, you know, Henry and I are
always happy to host that one.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.191
Why don't we hold the fundraiser
in the backyard?

29:19.235 --> 29:21.324
Oh.

29:21.368 --> 29:24.066
Well, because we're having
a high society event

29:24.110 --> 29:25.981
and not a hoedown.

29:26.025 --> 29:29.202
Well, we can have tables
and lanterns, and we can set up

29:29.245 --> 29:31.421
little center pieces
with peonies.

29:31.465 --> 29:33.554
Ooh, that sounds pretty.

29:33.597 --> 29:35.599
Yeah, I think
that's a great idea.

29:35.643 --> 29:36.775
Uh, Meredith, what do you think?

29:36.818 --> 29:38.472
Well, I think...

29:38.515 --> 29:41.344
that an event outside
means bugs.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.087
I'm sorry.
My answer's no.

29:46.654 --> 29:48.874
Well, let's go, ladies,
because we

29:48.917 --> 29:51.659
have a brunch to start
scheduling, right?

29:51.702 --> 29:54.923
Um, feel free to float
your little fundraiser idea

29:54.967 --> 29:57.360
next year if you
can figure out some way

29:57.404 --> 29:58.753
to make it work, right?

30:04.933 --> 30:07.370
Oh, no. I think Meredith
left her phone behind.

30:07.414 --> 30:10.025
I'm gonna go give it to her.

30:10.069 --> 30:11.157
Meredith.

30:14.900 --> 30:18.381
- You forgot your phone.
- Did I? Oh.

30:18.425 --> 30:20.166
It's okay, girls,
I'll meet you at the car.

30:23.778 --> 30:26.172
I suggest you reconsider
your decision.

30:26.215 --> 30:27.869
Excuse me.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.479
You're gonna have
the fundraiser here.

30:29.523 --> 30:31.612
Oh, I will do no such thing.

30:31.655 --> 30:35.311
- Well, I think you will.
- What is that?

30:38.358 --> 30:40.316
- He's hot.
- How did you...

30:40.360 --> 30:43.145
Better question, is how did you
land your own little boy toy?

30:46.409 --> 30:47.454
What do you think?

30:47.497 --> 30:49.064
Should we see if your husband

30:49.108 --> 30:51.893
has the same question?

30:51.937 --> 30:54.765
- Don't you threaten me.
- I'm blackmailing you.

30:54.809 --> 30:56.332
If you wanna be specific.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.247
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

30:58.291 --> 31:01.990
And your husband has no idea
who you're screwing around with.

31:02.034 --> 31:04.471
So, if you wanna keep it
that way

31:04.514 --> 31:06.995
I suggest you reconsider
breaking Stella's heart.

31:12.566 --> 31:15.351
Fine. But I'm not
going back in there.

31:15.395 --> 31:17.179
You can text her.

31:29.931 --> 31:32.586
So, I think Meredith
had a change of heart.

31:34.022 --> 31:35.894
What do you mean?

31:35.937 --> 31:38.853
Well, I appealed
to her sensitive side.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.682
I told her how much
this cause means to you

31:41.725 --> 31:45.468
and reminded her how important
it is to honor our mothers.

31:45.512 --> 31:48.950
That is very sweet of you.

31:48.994 --> 31:51.300
I don't think Meredith has
a sensitive bone in her body.

31:57.741 --> 32:00.396
It worked.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.963
She changed her mind.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.226
We are having
the fundraiser here.

32:04.270 --> 32:08.187
- That's awesome.
- Thank you so much.

32:08.230 --> 32:10.276
Alright, I gotta go.
I got lots to do.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.024
First of all, thank you so much for getting

32:19.067 --> 32:20.851
back to me so quickly.
I-I really appreciate this.

32:20.895 --> 32:22.636
Um, I've just kind
of been thinkin' about this

32:22.679 --> 32:24.116
maybe a little bit too much.

32:24.159 --> 32:27.119
Um, can we just add
five more cases of both

32:27.162 --> 32:29.382
the Cabernet
and the Chardonnay, please?

32:29.425 --> 32:31.993
Yeah, that would be great.
Um, let's think what else.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.343
You know what, let's just,
let's just double the order.

32:34.387 --> 32:36.606
Yeah, let's just do that.
Yeah, oh, oh, the Christinies.

32:36.650 --> 32:39.479
Yeah, let's triple that
appetizer though, specifically.

32:39.522 --> 32:42.656
The heat lamps, uh, we discussed
this but, uh, let's do ten.

32:42.699 --> 32:45.137
Ten heat lamps. Ten is
definitely the magic number.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.008
I was thinkin' about this,
and I've been to parties

32:47.052 --> 32:49.097
where they went out
of hors d'oeuvres early

32:49.141 --> 32:52.144
and the guest are in horrible
moods before dinner starts.

32:52.187 --> 32:54.276
Oh, no, I know that
y-you got everything handled.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.017
No, I-I, I'm sorry,
I totally appreciate that.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.411
And, and, and yes I trust you,
I trust you completely.

32:58.454 --> 33:00.195
Do we have enough servers?

33:09.465 --> 33:11.250
Are you sure I can't help you,
'cause I feel bad

33:11.293 --> 33:12.729
leaving you with all this mess?

33:12.773 --> 33:14.340
Oh, no, it's hardly
a mess at all.

33:14.383 --> 33:17.038
It'll only take few minutes.
Just go, relax.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.434
Okay. If you're gonna
twist my arm...

33:23.305 --> 33:25.829
Oh, wait. I have something
for you both.

33:33.098 --> 33:34.925
I had this made for you.

33:37.754 --> 33:39.713
That is something else.
It's beautiful.

33:39.756 --> 33:41.889
Yeah, if you're gonna have
such an amazing piece

33:41.932 --> 33:44.413
you might as well be able
to show it off properly.

33:44.457 --> 33:46.981
Wow, I... Thank you.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.897
And it can't be opened,
just so you feel safer about

33:49.940 --> 33:52.465
having it in the house
with the boys.

33:52.508 --> 33:55.424
You have officially just
become my new favorite person.

33:55.468 --> 33:57.600
And so I cleared a space
for it in the living room

33:57.644 --> 33:59.254
so that all the guests
will be able to see it

33:59.298 --> 34:00.995
when they arrive
for the fundraiser.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.692
That's perfect. I mean,
what a great excuse

34:02.736 --> 34:04.085
for me to brag
about my promotion.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.827
- You don't need excuses.
- Yes, I do.

34:06.870 --> 34:09.743
And I know you don't like
the cowboy chic look, Stella

34:09.786 --> 34:11.223
but I think that the glass case

34:11.266 --> 34:12.746
really helps it fit
the room better.

34:12.789 --> 34:15.270
Huh, well, a compromise,
I like it.

34:15.313 --> 34:16.880
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

34:16.924 --> 34:18.621
I'm gonna go finish off
the dishes.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.277
Well, it looks like you have
everything under control here.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.976
So, uh, I'm gonna steal
my wife away.

34:46.214 --> 34:49.565
Sweetheart, how long is it
appropriate to have a nanny?

34:49.609 --> 34:53.003
I mean, is keeping her until
the boys go to college too much?

34:53.047 --> 34:55.702
Ha ha. Nope.
Sounds good to me.

34:58.052 --> 35:00.228
- Scooch.
- Alright, I'm moving. Geez.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.247
So, his BP bottomed out.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.075
And for a second there, I
thought we were gonna lose him.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.207
But, uh, we managed
to stabilize him, so...

35:22.250 --> 35:23.817
so he went through grafts.

35:23.860 --> 35:26.385
It took us six hours.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.256
Well, you may have
saved a life, but...

35:28.300 --> 35:30.171
I came up with three
vegetarian options

35:30.215 --> 35:31.607
for the fundraiser today.

35:31.651 --> 35:32.565
Hm.

35:34.741 --> 35:36.482
I'm very proud of you, honey.

35:37.961 --> 35:40.312
Thank you.

35:40.355 --> 35:42.879
So, besides these three
vegetarian options

35:42.923 --> 35:44.098
what else happened
around here today?

35:44.142 --> 35:46.187
I mean, how are
our little terrors?

35:46.231 --> 35:48.842
Our terrors are fantastic.

35:48.885 --> 35:51.801
I'm not saying they're ready
for med school just yet

35:51.845 --> 35:55.631
but Nicky made his first
attempts to walk today.

35:55.675 --> 35:57.372
He did?

35:57.416 --> 35:58.504
When I was writing
he almost walked off

35:58.547 --> 36:00.593
the change table today.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.551
I think both Blake and me
to keep those two out of trouble

36:02.595 --> 36:04.205
so, I'm hoping they wait till
after the party before they

36:04.249 --> 36:05.859
try to move too much.
You know what I mean?

36:05.902 --> 36:07.382
Yeah, alright, the party.

36:07.426 --> 36:08.818
Right, right, so how is it

36:08.862 --> 36:10.603
planning your first
big charity event?

36:10.646 --> 36:14.563
It's going good.
I mean, it's exhausting.

36:14.607 --> 36:16.957
I can see why people make
a career out of it.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.222
But, I'm grateful
for the chance.

36:21.266 --> 36:24.312
I still have no idea what Blake
said to Meredith though.

36:24.356 --> 36:26.793
She must have
some real dirt on her.

36:26.836 --> 36:29.752
You don't know the half of it.

36:29.796 --> 36:33.147
It's like she's truly becoming
part of the family.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.236
She not becoming part
of the family.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.282
She is family.

36:37.325 --> 36:39.240
Okay.

36:39.284 --> 36:42.374
- Thank you.
- You did good.

36:42.417 --> 36:45.246
We did good.
Alright, which movie?

36:45.290 --> 36:46.856
Huh, well...

36:46.900 --> 36:48.423
Not the doctor one again.

36:59.173 --> 37:03.177
- He's really cute.
- Didl don't know. that? mayb,

37:03.221 --> 37:06.267
- He did. Yeah, he did.
- Oh.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.617
- He also give me this one too.
- Very good.

37:08.661 --> 37:10.445
What's all this?

37:10.489 --> 37:12.708
Hi! Oh, sorry. I thought
you were upstairs.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.884
Blake, this is Julianna,
Walt's daughter.

37:14.928 --> 37:17.322
Hi. You must be the nanny.

37:17.365 --> 37:18.801
Oh, well, I like to think
of myself

37:18.845 --> 37:20.455
as more than just a nanny.

37:20.499 --> 37:22.979
Right, of course.

37:23.023 --> 37:26.069
Uh, Stella called you
a baby whisperer.

37:26.113 --> 37:29.682
Must be nice. I tried
to pick Nicky up once

37:29.725 --> 37:33.033
and I'm pretty sure he cried
for the next three days.

37:33.076 --> 37:36.254
Oh. Well, maybe he just
doesn't like you.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.956
Um, I thought we could start

37:42.999 --> 37:45.393
with the questions
for University of Hawaii.

37:45.437 --> 37:48.788
Hmm, you're still set on Hawaii.

37:48.831 --> 37:50.529
I'm sure your dad loves that.

37:50.572 --> 37:54.184
He loves it so much
that he left another

37:54.228 --> 37:55.882
brochure for an in-state school

37:55.925 --> 37:57.927
on the kitchen counter
this morning.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.625
How close to home this time?

37:59.668 --> 38:03.324
- Fifteen miles.
- Mm.

38:03.368 --> 38:06.719
I gotta tell ya, I'm kinda
with your dad on this one.

38:06.762 --> 38:09.417
It's not gonna be easy
to see you leave.

38:09.461 --> 38:13.116
Don't worry. I'll come home
every Christmas.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.728
- I promise.
- Alright.

38:19.732 --> 38:23.649
Tell us about your
most painful memory?

38:23.692 --> 38:27.392
Wow. These are pretty intense.

38:27.435 --> 38:29.307
I wanna write about my mom.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.788
What about your mom?

38:32.832 --> 38:36.705
- You know, you don't have to.
- No, it's okay.

38:36.749 --> 38:39.142
She left when I was ten.

38:39.186 --> 38:42.320
Chose a new boyfriend
who didn't like kids over me.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.976
Mothers like that
deserve the worst.

38:52.982 --> 38:55.376
So, yeah.

38:55.420 --> 38:58.118
I wanted to write about her

38:58.161 --> 39:01.817
about how she chose to leave.

39:01.861 --> 39:05.865
But also, I wanted
to put you in the essay.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.782
It sucks that she took off.

39:09.825 --> 39:12.959
But, you've been amazing.

39:13.002 --> 39:16.832
So, maybe life works itself out.

39:16.876 --> 39:20.967
Thank you.
You've been amazing too.

39:21.010 --> 39:23.056
I'm gonna go make dinner.

39:23.099 --> 39:25.450
Alright, let's try to get you
in Hawaii.

39:25.493 --> 39:27.408
Okay.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.802
Okay, so his name is Jeremy.

39:29.845 --> 39:32.021
And you guys haven't kissed yet?

39:33.719 --> 39:34.981
- Answer that.
- I...

39:35.024 --> 39:36.548
I don't really know what to say.

39:36.591 --> 39:38.724
Oh, come on, give me the good stuff.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.639
- No-ho-ho!
- No, this is gonna be fun.

39:51.911 --> 39:54.043
Got a lot done today.
I feel good about our progress.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.306
Well, your progress.

39:56.350 --> 40:00.528
After all these hours,
I'd say it's our progress.

40:00.572 --> 40:02.748
I'll print it out, so we can
double check the typos.

40:02.791 --> 40:05.228
Yeah. Send it to the printer
in Tanner's office.

40:16.892 --> 40:20.243
Tanner doesn't like
anyone in here without him.

40:20.287 --> 40:23.421
Then what are you doing in here?

40:23.464 --> 40:24.857
I live here.

40:24.900 --> 40:27.903
Well, Tanner's known me
my entire life.

40:27.947 --> 40:30.384
I'm sure he won't mind
if I use his printer.

40:31.994 --> 40:34.649
So, you and Stella
are really close?

40:35.911 --> 40:39.480
She's like a mom to me.

40:39.524 --> 40:42.048
Yeah, but you know
you're not her daughter.

40:42.091 --> 40:44.746
Okay, you're not either.

40:47.357 --> 40:49.055
Alght, I'm gonna go.

40:50.578 --> 40:53.494
What are you doing?

40:53.538 --> 40:56.018
I just wanted to wish you luck
with your application.

40:58.673 --> 41:00.283
Good luck.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.813
This is so cute. Yeah.

41:07.856 --> 41:09.031
What do you think
about this one?

41:09.075 --> 41:11.033
- Is this too casual?
- Yeah.

41:11.077 --> 41:12.992
Alright,
this is gonna be perfect.

41:13.035 --> 41:16.517
It is the first family portrait
since the twins were born.

41:16.561 --> 41:17.823
I like that one...

41:17.866 --> 41:19.128
Yeah. Me too.

41:21.304 --> 41:25.439
Excuse me.
This is Stella.

41:25.483 --> 41:30.052
Actually we're gonna need
a few more tables than that.

41:30.096 --> 41:31.706
This is adorable.

41:31.750 --> 41:34.883
Uh, that sounds perfect.
Thank you.

41:37.756 --> 41:39.540
Oh. Hi!

41:42.848 --> 41:43.979
- Hi!
- What are you doing back?

41:44.023 --> 41:45.285
I thought you were in Tahiti.

41:45.328 --> 41:48.070
Oh. Ah, the trip
got cut short.

41:48.114 --> 41:49.376
Edward got called to Shanghai

41:49.419 --> 41:50.986
to finish working
on this merger.

41:51.030 --> 41:53.554
Oh, oh, that's, that's good
for Edward, right?

41:53.598 --> 41:56.818
But I know how long
you were planning this trip.

41:56.862 --> 41:58.864
Am I a horrible person
if I'm actually happy

41:58.907 --> 42:01.780
you're back in town in time
for the society fundraiser?

42:01.823 --> 42:04.739
Of course, Stella. I'm actually
glad I get to be there.

42:04.783 --> 42:07.873
I swear, the charity cue is
the first thing I heard about

42:07.916 --> 42:09.309
as soon as I got home
from the airport.

42:09.352 --> 42:11.006
Wow.

42:11.050 --> 42:12.573
How does it feel
to beat out Meredith?

42:12.617 --> 42:14.662
Does anyone ever really beat
out Meredith?

42:14.706 --> 42:16.098
Oh, that's true.

42:16.142 --> 42:17.709
I'm happy to have
won this round.

42:17.752 --> 42:19.362
But I got my work
cut out for me.

42:19.406 --> 42:21.147
It takes a lot
of planning to pull a party

42:21.190 --> 42:22.801
together so quickly.

42:22.844 --> 42:24.585
I don't know what I would do
without Blake.

42:24.629 --> 42:26.848
So, thank you.

42:26.892 --> 42:28.763
Blake?

42:28.807 --> 42:31.505
Blake Noland, you and her parents, like...

42:31.549 --> 42:33.159
Nicky, no!

42:33.202 --> 42:35.161
Oh. I-I gotta...

42:35.204 --> 42:36.815
Absolutely. Go. Um,
I'll see you at the fundraiser.

42:36.858 --> 42:38.556
- Alright, I'll talk to you soon.
- Okay, bye.

42:40.209 --> 42:41.820
Everything, okay? Whoa!

42:41.863 --> 42:44.474
He was just being fussy,
and I thought he was hungry

42:44.518 --> 42:45.737
but I guess he's not.

42:45.780 --> 42:46.825
That's okay.
I'll just take this.

42:46.868 --> 42:48.435
I'm so sorry.

42:48.478 --> 42:50.176
Oh, it's nothing compared
to the damage

42:50.219 --> 42:54.484
these two usually
inflict in stores.

42:54.528 --> 42:55.573
Makes me wonder how
they're gonna be during

42:55.616 --> 42:57.183
the photoshoot though.

42:57.226 --> 42:58.532
Oh, so, I was thinking
that you might need

42:58.576 --> 43:00.142
a little extra help distracting

43:00.186 --> 43:01.666
you know, since I'm gonna be
a part of it.

43:01.709 --> 43:03.015
I am glad you said that.

43:03.058 --> 43:04.364
I was gonna give you the day off

43:04.407 --> 43:05.974
but I think I'm gonna
need your help.

43:06.018 --> 43:07.715
Is that okay?

43:07.759 --> 43:09.717
Mm-hm.
Yeah, yeah, of course.

43:09.761 --> 43:12.198
Okay, great.
I'm just gonna...

43:12.241 --> 43:14.461
Hi. I'm just so
sorry about this.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.466
Okay. Think I saw something
over here that could work.

43:34.699 --> 43:37.571
So, you wanna
tell me what's wrong?

43:37.615 --> 43:39.312
I thought you were excited about

43:39.355 --> 43:41.662
having dinner with Stella
and Tanner tonight.

43:42.837 --> 43:44.622
I was.

43:44.665 --> 43:46.667
I'm just not feeling well.

43:48.713 --> 43:51.933
I'm not buying it.

43:51.977 --> 43:55.023
So, what's really goin' on?

43:55.067 --> 43:56.721
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

43:56.764 --> 43:59.506
But, it's Blake.

44:00.768 --> 44:02.683
Blake, the nanny?

44:02.727 --> 44:04.816
She creeps me out.

44:04.859 --> 44:07.209
Really?

44:07.253 --> 44:10.735
Huh. She seems like
such a nice girl.

44:10.778 --> 44:14.086
She followed me into
Tanner's study, and...

44:14.129 --> 44:15.783
I don't know.

44:15.827 --> 44:19.047
It's not what she said,
it's how she said it.

44:21.920 --> 44:23.399
What'd she say?

44:23.443 --> 44:25.619
That I'm not Stella's daughter.

44:27.577 --> 44:29.884
Sounds jealous to me.

44:29.928 --> 44:31.233
That's what I thought.

44:31.277 --> 44:32.713
And that's why I'm not

44:32.757 --> 44:35.542
especially feeling up
to dinner tonight.

44:35.585 --> 44:37.283
I'm not looking forward
to facing her.

44:39.154 --> 44:41.417
You don't think she could
do anything...

44:43.942 --> 44:45.770
hurt you?

44:47.423 --> 44:50.513
I'm sure it's just all
in my head.

44:50.557 --> 44:53.125
No. I respect your opinion,
I mean, if you think

44:53.168 --> 44:56.519
that something's off about her,
you're probably right.

44:56.563 --> 44:58.696
I just don't wanna make
a big deal out of it.

45:01.089 --> 45:03.570
Well, how 'bout this,
because it's a little late

45:03.613 --> 45:05.093
to back out of dinner now.

45:06.834 --> 45:08.706
I'll keep an eye
on Blake tonight.

45:10.490 --> 45:12.100
I'm sure it's nothing.

45:12.144 --> 45:15.408
Really. I'm sure
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

46:36.968 --> 46:40.188
You just had to come here early,
didn't you?

46:54.812 --> 46:57.597
No, you are gonna
love the shirts. Honest.

46:57.640 --> 46:59.729
I am not wearing
matching outfits, okay?

46:59.773 --> 47:01.514
Blake, back me up here.

47:06.432 --> 47:08.869
Oh...

47:08.913 --> 47:11.611
I'm so sorry.
It's all yours.

47:11.654 --> 47:13.918
Is everything okay, girls?

47:13.961 --> 47:15.223
Everything's fine.

47:20.750 --> 47:23.275
I ran into
Shelley Matthews today.

47:23.318 --> 47:25.364
She and Edward just for back
from their anniversary trip.

47:25.407 --> 47:27.279
Well, good. They'll be back
in time for the party.

47:27.322 --> 47:30.238
That's good. Um, did you have
a chance to say hello, Blake?

47:30.282 --> 47:31.718
Oh, do you know the Matthews?

47:31.761 --> 47:32.893
Actually Shelley was
the one who recommended

47:32.937 --> 47:34.460
Blake for the job.

47:34.503 --> 47:36.157
Old family friends
of Blake's parents.

47:36.201 --> 47:37.811
But, I didn't get
to talk to Shelley

47:37.855 --> 47:39.639
because the boys
were getting fussy.

47:47.299 --> 47:49.214
And what happened to your arm?

47:49.257 --> 47:51.172
Oh. Nothing.

47:51.216 --> 47:52.695
Well, that doesn't look
like nothing.

47:52.739 --> 47:54.349
Did something happen?
What, let me see that.

47:54.393 --> 47:56.351
No, it's, it's just a scratch.

47:56.395 --> 47:59.659
I, um, I got it from one
of the boys.

47:59.702 --> 48:01.530
Can you get the bandages from
the downstairs bathroom, pase?

48:01.574 --> 48:03.054
- Yeah, let's take care of it.
- No, it's just a scratch.

48:03.097 --> 48:04.794
It's not a medical emergency.

48:04.838 --> 48:05.970
I know, but we don't want
that get infected...

48:06.013 --> 48:07.319
It's fine!

48:12.106 --> 48:14.282
I'm sorry.

48:14.326 --> 48:16.067
I didn't mean to yell.

48:18.286 --> 48:20.027
It's been a really long day.

48:21.637 --> 48:24.205
I'm gonna go put
the boys to bed.

48:33.432 --> 48:35.303
Excuse me, I need to go
to the bathroom.

48:41.048 --> 48:42.963
Did something happen while
you were out with Blake today?

48:43.007 --> 48:46.097
Nicky spilled food, so I had
to buy an extra blouse.

48:46.140 --> 48:47.837
Maybe she's feeling
guilty about that?

48:49.056 --> 48:50.536
I'm sure getting scratched

48:50.579 --> 48:52.581
by one of the twins
didn't improve her day.

48:52.625 --> 48:54.366
The scratches didn't look
like they came from a baby

48:54.409 --> 48:56.107
and the marks were
too widely spaced.

48:56.150 --> 48:59.197
Well, kids with
injuries like that

48:59.240 --> 49:03.375
a lotta times,
they-they do it to themselves.

49:03.418 --> 49:05.116
Okay, it's just a scratch.

49:05.159 --> 49:06.726
Jumping to self-harm
is a bit drastic.

49:06.769 --> 49:08.554
Maybe not.

49:08.597 --> 49:11.035
But Juliana did say
that Blake had been

49:11.078 --> 49:13.515
treating her kinda strange.

49:13.559 --> 49:16.127
Did you...

49:16.170 --> 49:18.259
How much do you actually
know about this girl?

49:18.303 --> 49:20.783
Uh, she had great letters
of recommendations.

49:20.827 --> 49:22.133
- What do you mean strange?
- Well, just...

49:22.176 --> 49:25.397
You know, kind of, jealous.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.268
I mean, did you call
any of her recommendations?

49:27.312 --> 49:29.488
Because behavior like that,
hurting yourself

49:29.531 --> 49:31.664
it's, it's not normal.

49:31.707 --> 49:33.318
Yes, I did, I called all three.

49:33.361 --> 49:35.189
And everyone had only great
things to say about her.

49:37.061 --> 49:38.976
I mean...

49:39.019 --> 49:40.673
She's 20, right?

49:40.716 --> 49:42.457
Basically a teenager,
and I'm pretty sure

49:42.501 --> 49:46.418
teenagers behavior never falls
under the label of normal.

49:46.461 --> 49:49.247
Up until today,
Blake's been an amazing nanny.

49:55.122 --> 49:56.906
You okay, sweetie?

49:56.950 --> 49:58.865
I'm not feeling good.

49:58.908 --> 50:00.432
Can I get you something?

50:00.475 --> 50:04.044
Why don't we
get you home, huh? Yeah?

50:04.088 --> 50:05.437
Guys, we're gonna go.

50:05.480 --> 50:07.221
Um, you'll have to excuse us.

50:09.093 --> 50:10.659
Well, at least let me
walk you out.

50:10.703 --> 50:12.400
Come on, man,
we know the way out.

50:12.444 --> 50:13.575
Um, I'll give you a call.

50:13.619 --> 50:15.229
Honey, feel better, please.

50:15.273 --> 50:17.014
- Yeah, I'll talk to you.
- Yeah.

50:19.538 --> 50:22.367
Okay, um, I will be
talking to Blake

50:22.410 --> 50:24.064
after the boys go to asleep.

50:24.108 --> 50:26.110
Yeah, I mean, I guess,
if it really was just a bad day

50:26.153 --> 50:27.502
she'll appreciate that.

50:42.648 --> 50:46.130
So, uh, Nicky seems to be
crying less before bedtime

50:46.173 --> 50:48.828
falling asleep faster.

50:48.871 --> 50:51.265
Maybe he's finally outgrowing
the colic, huh?

50:51.309 --> 50:53.833
Well, maybe.

50:53.876 --> 50:55.922
I'm sorry about
yelling at dinner.

50:58.577 --> 51:02.842
We have rough days, right?
Yeah.

51:02.885 --> 51:04.322
Actually that's why I'm here.

51:04.365 --> 51:06.063
Wanted to see if you
want to talk?

51:06.106 --> 51:08.630
- Yeah.
- Okay. Let's do this.

51:16.073 --> 51:18.814
So, you wanna tell me
what happened today?

51:19.946 --> 51:21.817
It's no big deal, really.

51:24.472 --> 51:26.692
My mom called

51:26.735 --> 51:30.043
and I haven't heard
from her in weeks.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.350
She got into this argument
with my dad

51:32.393 --> 51:35.266
and she wanted me
to take her side.

51:35.309 --> 51:38.138
I only hear from her when she
wants something from me.

51:40.140 --> 51:43.274
I'm sorry. That's no way
for a mom to behave.

51:43.317 --> 51:44.753
Oh, well, I hate
fighting with her

51:44.797 --> 51:46.538
but she just doesn't get me.

51:48.017 --> 51:50.107
Hmm.

51:50.150 --> 51:53.414
Guilt and arguments with mom.

51:53.458 --> 51:57.157
I used to have some knock-down
drag-outs with mine.

51:57.201 --> 52:00.682
It's funny, I would give
anything to get those back.

52:00.726 --> 52:02.597
I'm sorry.

52:02.641 --> 52:04.991
She died when I was 18.

52:05.034 --> 52:07.167
So, appreciate
what you have with yours

52:07.211 --> 52:10.779
while she's still around.

52:10.823 --> 52:12.085
Was it sudden?

52:14.305 --> 52:17.351
Sudden enough.
Pancreatic cancer.

52:17.395 --> 52:19.527
Two months between diagnosis
and the end.

52:21.834 --> 52:24.010
That must have been rough.

52:24.053 --> 52:25.707
Yeah. It was.

52:28.449 --> 52:30.451
And I was pregnant at the time.

52:34.107 --> 52:36.370
I cannot believe
I just told you that.

52:36.414 --> 52:39.678
Tanner's the only other person
who knows.

52:39.721 --> 52:42.333
Well, I'm glad you feel like
I'm someone you can trust.

52:44.944 --> 52:48.817
So, um, what happened
to the baby?

52:50.210 --> 52:51.472
Um, well...

52:53.257 --> 52:56.738
My mom was supposed
to help me raise her.

52:56.782 --> 53:01.917
And after she was gone, I just,
like, I couldn't make a living

53:01.961 --> 53:04.877
and I had to do it without her.

53:04.920 --> 53:07.793
So, I found
a really great family

53:07.836 --> 53:11.231
that wanted to adopt her.

53:11.275 --> 53:14.495
So, you just gave her up?

53:14.539 --> 53:16.323
Oh, you make it sound
like it was easy.

53:16.367 --> 53:18.282
You just abandoned her,
without caring

53:18.325 --> 53:20.806
what would happen to her after.

53:20.849 --> 53:22.721
No, no, it wasn't like that.

53:22.764 --> 53:26.290
No, I gave her up,
because I cared.

53:26.333 --> 53:27.900
But if you cared so much

53:27.943 --> 53:31.512
why didn't you try
to talk to her again?

53:31.556 --> 53:32.905
It was a closed adoption.

53:32.948 --> 53:34.341
It was up to the family when

53:34.385 --> 53:35.951
or if they chose
to tell her about me.

53:35.995 --> 53:39.433
I wouldn't have
just given her away.

53:39.477 --> 53:44.003
Look, Blake,
raising her on my own...

53:44.046 --> 53:46.745
I couldn't give her
the life that she deserved.

53:49.095 --> 53:50.836
And what happened to the father?

53:52.316 --> 53:54.143
Roger was a jerk.

53:54.187 --> 53:55.493
He was out of the door
before I finished

53:55.536 --> 53:57.582
saying the words
"Pregnancy test."

54:00.324 --> 54:02.413
I was on my own.

54:02.456 --> 54:04.284
But you didn't even keep
in contact with the people

54:04.328 --> 54:06.373
that you handed
your own child over to.

54:06.417 --> 54:08.636
That's how they wanted it.

54:08.680 --> 54:12.379
But there's the internet.
It exists for a reason.

54:12.423 --> 54:14.903
She was in a great home.
Okay?

54:14.947 --> 54:17.776
So, I respected the family's
wishes to keep my distance.

54:17.819 --> 54:20.387
It was the hardest thing
I ever had to do.

54:23.782 --> 54:26.654
You don't even know your own
daughter's name, do you?

54:26.698 --> 54:28.874
I wouldn't have
just given her away like that!

54:28.917 --> 54:31.268
And if I were her, I would've
wanted you to come find me!

55:08.392 --> 55:11.177
You know, like the slightest
thing seems to set her off.

55:11.220 --> 55:13.527
Sounds like she has a lot
going on in her personal life.

55:13.571 --> 55:16.704
- You know, she's pretty young.
- I know.

55:16.748 --> 55:18.358
She just takes
everything personally.

55:18.402 --> 55:20.360
You know, like,
it's happening to her.

55:20.404 --> 55:22.362
And I'm sure it doesn't help
that her parents

55:22.406 --> 55:24.538
were never really there for her.

55:24.582 --> 55:26.279
- Did she tell you that?
- Yeah.

55:26.323 --> 55:28.368
Their relationship
is non-existent.

55:30.196 --> 55:31.719
She's in need of a mother figure
and I feel like

55:31.763 --> 55:33.504
she's turning to me for that.

55:35.593 --> 55:37.595
Well, she's got great taste.

55:37.638 --> 55:40.902
You are one
of the best mothers I know.

55:40.946 --> 55:43.296
Thanyou, baby.
That's sweet.

55:43.340 --> 55:45.124
Well, I aim to please.

55:49.346 --> 55:51.130
Oh, crap! We need
to get back to home.

55:51.173 --> 55:52.784
Uh, the photographer's gonna be
there in like, ten minutes.

55:52.827 --> 55:55.743
And we need to change.

55:55.787 --> 55:57.919
Here you go, buddy. Let's get
you guys in a nice position.

55:57.963 --> 55:59.834
There you go, you guys together.

55:59.878 --> 56:02.794
Here's your ball. Looks good.

56:02.837 --> 56:04.665
You can lean on that
if you want.

56:04.709 --> 56:07.712
Oh-oh. Alright. You ready?

56:07.755 --> 56:10.541
This will be quick
and painless, I promise.

56:10.584 --> 56:13.239
Yeah. Uh, you better share.

56:13.282 --> 56:15.459
You got it? Uh, there you go,
right about there.

56:15.502 --> 56:16.721
Perfect, perfect.

56:19.680 --> 56:20.551
Stella?

56:22.379 --> 56:24.946
I'm sorry about last night.

56:24.990 --> 56:27.471
Thank you for saying that.

56:27.514 --> 56:29.386
Are you feelin' better today?

56:29.429 --> 56:32.301
Well, I'm still
really embarrassed.

56:32.345 --> 56:34.216
You know, that I had
a fight with my mom

56:34.260 --> 56:36.436
and I took it out on you.

56:36.480 --> 56:37.742
Come here.

56:41.528 --> 56:43.574
It's okay.

56:43.617 --> 56:45.706
No, it's not,
because you're so nice

56:45.750 --> 56:47.534
to me and you trusted me.

56:49.754 --> 56:53.888
Yeah, um, what I told you

56:53.932 --> 56:56.804
I'd appreciate if you wouldn't
mention it to anyone else?

56:56.848 --> 56:59.851
Oh, yeah, I won't tell anyone,
I promise.

56:59.894 --> 57:02.680
Again, I'm so, so sorry.

57:02.723 --> 57:04.899
We're okay. Promise.

57:04.943 --> 57:07.467
If anything, it made us closer.

57:09.513 --> 57:10.905
Okay?

57:10.949 --> 57:12.298
Honey, we better get
this photo taken

57:12.341 --> 57:14.213
before Nicky starts walking.

57:15.910 --> 57:16.998
I gotta go.

57:19.174 --> 57:21.307
- Okay. Here we go, guys.
- Hello.

57:21.350 --> 57:22.613
- Are you ready?
- Oh, my goodness.

57:22.656 --> 57:26.094
Okay. Everybody has their toy?

57:28.662 --> 57:30.272
- Nice. Here we go. Ready?
- Good job.

57:30.316 --> 57:31.709
- Thank you.
- Okay.

57:35.364 --> 57:39.107
I have to admit. My wife
was right about those outfits.

57:39.151 --> 57:42.807
So, what do you think,
no baby spit up on this?

57:42.850 --> 57:44.852
- You clean up well.
- Wow.

57:44.896 --> 57:47.028
What do you think
I normally look like?

57:47.072 --> 57:49.857
Well, I think you look like a
man who should trust his wife's

57:49.901 --> 57:52.773
impeccable sense
of fashion more often.

57:52.817 --> 57:56.647
- Wow. You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

57:56.690 --> 57:58.518
You keep talking like that,
and you're headed

57:58.562 --> 57:59.693
for the night of your life.

57:59.737 --> 58:00.825
Ooh.

58:02.043 --> 58:04.132
Alright. Goodnight.

58:04.176 --> 58:05.873
Have a great night.

58:07.396 --> 58:08.615
Thank you.

58:11.052 --> 58:12.619
- Thank you.
- This'll be fun.

58:12.663 --> 58:15.274
Yes.

58:15.317 --> 58:16.928
You know,
the last couple of days,

58:16.971 --> 58:17.972
a little difficult
for us, right?

58:18.016 --> 58:19.496
Yup. I talked with her.

58:19.539 --> 58:21.933
I don't want you to worry.

58:21.976 --> 58:24.326
- Alright, let's just have fun.
- Alright.

58:28.940 --> 58:30.724
Look at them so happy.

58:43.041 --> 58:46.566
You four are
the perfect little family.

58:46.610 --> 58:48.699
Family you don't think
I'm good enough for.

58:57.838 --> 58:59.666
Dinner was amazing.

58:59.710 --> 59:01.668
And the company
wasn't so bad either.

59:01.712 --> 59:03.409
Oh, you're just happy
to be out of the house.

59:03.452 --> 59:05.280
This is our first real date

59:05.324 --> 59:07.239
since before
the twins were born.

59:07.282 --> 59:09.546
Wow! Has it really
been that long?

59:09.589 --> 59:11.983
I mean, have I mentioned how
happy I am to have Blake around?

59:12.026 --> 59:14.768
Yes. Many times. Me too.

59:14.812 --> 59:16.030
Well, since dinner's over

59:16.074 --> 59:19.207
I have a little surprise
for you.

59:19.251 --> 59:21.601
What are you talking about?

59:21.645 --> 59:23.603
Oh, you'll see.

59:29.696 --> 59:32.481
If I had to grow up without her,
then so do you.

59:42.927 --> 59:44.755
- What?
- Blake?

59:44.798 --> 59:48.193
- Oh, God. Where are you?
- What does it matter?

59:48.236 --> 59:50.499
Don't say that. We've been
looking everywhere for you.

59:50.543 --> 59:52.110
Please come home.

59:52.153 --> 59:54.547
That house is not my home.

59:54.591 --> 59:57.158
Blake, this will always
be your home.

59:57.202 --> 59:58.899
Honey, are you taking
your medication?

59:58.943 --> 01:00:00.248
I hate you.

01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:12.609
So, what's the surprise, honey?

01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:15.742
Ah, I see you can't, uh, can't
handle not being in control...

01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:18.049
- Okay, tell me.
- Heh heh heh.

01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:20.834
Alright, we are going
to the beach house.

01:00:22.749 --> 01:00:26.666
Oh, our first date.

01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:30.670
You know what, that's Walt.
Let me, uh, just get that.

01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:32.585
- Hey, Walt.
- Hey, Walt.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.718
Hey, it's just the two
of you guys, right?

01:00:34.761 --> 01:00:36.894
- Yeah, yeah, what's up?
- Alright, listen.

01:00:36.937 --> 01:00:38.809
I ran your nanny
through the system.

01:00:38.852 --> 01:00:40.593
- Yeah?
- Why?

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.464
After Juliana told me about, you know

01:00:42.508 --> 01:00:45.337
Blake's weird behavior,
and then seeing it for myself

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.687
I decided to do some digging.

01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:49.123
W-what did you find?

01:00:49.167 --> 01:00:51.560
I found absolutely nothing.

01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:53.562
I mean, it's like
she doesn't even exist.

01:00:53.606 --> 01:00:55.390
The only Blake Noland
that comes up

01:00:55.434 --> 01:00:58.306
is a 40-year-old mechanic
in Minnesota.

01:00:58.350 --> 01:01:00.047
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

01:01:00.091 --> 01:01:02.180
Whoever's with your kids

01:01:02.223 --> 01:01:04.269
is not who she claims to be.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.706
We need to get home, now.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.055
Yeah, let's go.

01:01:22.156 --> 01:01:23.897
- What the hell.
- The boys.

01:01:30.295 --> 01:01:31.688
Okay, stay right here.

01:01:34.734 --> 01:01:36.127
Blake?

01:02:21.259 --> 01:02:23.652
Stella, I am so sorry
about the frame.

01:02:30.877 --> 01:02:32.444
What the hell is this?

01:02:33.532 --> 01:02:34.838
Oh.

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:38.406
No, no, I can, I can explain.
It's, uh...

01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:43.585
You're okay, buddy.

01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:51.376
Y-you're watching us?

01:02:54.074 --> 01:02:55.554
Well, I wouldn't have to,
if you just treated me

01:02:55.597 --> 01:02:58.122
like a real family member.

01:02:58.165 --> 01:02:59.384
Well, I don't even know
who you are.

01:02:59.427 --> 01:03:01.952
Y-y-you need to leave, now.

01:03:01.995 --> 01:03:04.824
No. This is my home now.

01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:07.609
Oh, no, no, no.
This is my home.

01:03:07.653 --> 01:03:09.350
And I'm telling you to get out.

01:03:09.394 --> 01:03:12.614
Well, you would fall apart
without me.

01:03:12.658 --> 01:03:14.703
You got 20 seconds
before I call the cops.

01:03:14.747 --> 01:03:17.837
So, you would call the cops
on your own daughter?

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:20.144
Oh, my gosh, you need help.

01:03:20.187 --> 01:03:21.798
Y-you're not my daughter.

01:03:22.755 --> 01:03:24.409
No. I am.

01:03:24.452 --> 01:03:26.541
My real name's Blake Miguel.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.544
I'm your abandoned daughter.

01:03:29.588 --> 01:03:31.068
You remember, in the interview

01:03:31.111 --> 01:03:33.287
how you said you felt
like you knew me?

01:03:34.854 --> 01:03:36.421
Oh...

01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:40.381
Why didn't you just tell me?

01:03:40.425 --> 01:03:42.253
Because I shouldn't have to.

01:03:43.994 --> 01:03:45.212
I just wanted you to have
everything

01:03:45.256 --> 01:03:46.779
that I couldn't give you.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:48.346
Yeah, well, I didn't have
the great life

01:03:48.389 --> 01:03:49.956
that you think I did.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.740
Mm, no, no, the Miguels

01:03:51.784 --> 01:03:55.483
they, they seemed
like caring people.

01:03:55.527 --> 01:03:57.790
No, they didn't love me

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.879
not like a real mother
would have.

01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:02.839
I just wanted
what was best for you, Blake.

01:04:02.882 --> 01:04:05.493
But what was best for me
was to be with my real mom.

01:04:05.537 --> 01:04:06.930
I'm s-sorry.

01:04:06.973 --> 01:04:09.846
Well, then, let me stay.

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:12.413
- Mm, I can't do that.
- Why not?

01:04:12.457 --> 01:04:16.678
Because you aren't stable,
and I-I can't have you...

01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:18.898
So, you're just gonna
abandon me again?

01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:20.900
No, I'm gonna help you get
the treatment that you need.

01:04:20.944 --> 01:04:23.772
But I don't need treatment.
I'm not crazy.

01:04:23.816 --> 01:04:26.775
Listen to me, I will not
leave you, I won't leave you.

01:04:26.819 --> 01:04:28.429
I should've known
you're never gonna accept me.

01:04:28.473 --> 01:04:30.214
You're just a selfish bitch.

01:04:30.257 --> 01:04:33.913
Stop! Blake, Blake!
Blake, listen! Stop it, Blake.

01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:36.350
- Blake, calm down!
- I hate you!

01:04:49.668 --> 01:04:51.713
Okay, okay, here's your buddy,
here's your bear.

01:04:51.757 --> 01:04:52.627
Okay.

01:04:55.326 --> 01:04:56.588
Oh, baby.

01:04:57.371 --> 01:04:58.372
Come on.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.506
It's okay.

01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:37.368
Blake was always a little odd.

01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:38.499
Odd?

01:05:38.543 --> 01:05:40.197
She has attachment

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.460
abandonment issues.

01:05:42.503 --> 01:05:45.767
Any slight, any breakup

01:05:45.811 --> 01:05:47.944
any sort of rejection

01:05:47.987 --> 01:05:49.467
she couldn't handle it.

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:51.599
So, she was never happy?

01:05:51.643 --> 01:05:54.951
Her father and I did
our very best. We really did.

01:05:54.994 --> 01:05:56.996
We gave her everything.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.563
We sent her to the best schools.

01:05:58.606 --> 01:06:00.043
We got her a tutor.

01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:02.523
We supported her passions.

01:06:02.567 --> 01:06:04.525
We brought her to the therapist.

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.572
But none of it helped?

01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:10.357
She was struggling so much.

01:06:10.401 --> 01:06:14.883
So, a month ago, we told her
the truth about the adoption.

01:06:14.927 --> 01:06:17.712
We hoped that we would help her
work through her emotions

01:06:17.756 --> 01:06:19.279
in a positive manner

01:06:19.323 --> 01:06:22.282
begin the healing process.

01:06:22.326 --> 01:06:25.633
But it ended up
being a huge mistake.

01:06:25.677 --> 01:06:27.505
You gave her
my contact information.

01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:30.464
No, we-we didn't.

01:06:30.508 --> 01:06:34.207
We were afraid
she might lash out.

01:06:34.251 --> 01:06:37.254
She's not a bad person,
she just...

01:06:37.297 --> 01:06:39.691
She has a history
of stalking people.

01:06:39.734 --> 01:06:41.519
S-stalking?

01:06:41.562 --> 01:06:42.911
I don't know
how many times we went

01:06:42.955 --> 01:06:44.957
to the police station
to pick her up

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.786
because she wouldn't leave
some boyfriend alone.

01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:50.006
She actually burned up
one of their cars.

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:56.099
It hurts me to say,
but Blake is dangerous.

01:06:56.142 --> 01:06:58.536
Well, what do we do?

01:06:58.579 --> 01:07:01.974
We need to find her and get her
back on her medication.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:04.716
But until we do...

01:07:04.759 --> 01:07:08.372
if you see her,
you need to contact the police.

01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:11.114
Okay.

01:07:14.334 --> 01:07:15.683
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you for your time.

01:07:15.727 --> 01:07:16.902
Mm-hmm.

01:07:20.949 --> 01:07:23.387
Walt, it's as serious
as you thought.

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:24.649
We need help.

01:07:45.017 --> 01:07:46.975
We can't risk it, there's
no telling what she'll do.

01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:49.848
Look, I'm sure
Blake is long gone by now.

01:07:49.891 --> 01:07:51.632
And what if she isn't?

01:07:51.676 --> 01:07:54.679
I think she was really angry
with me for giving her up.

01:07:54.722 --> 01:07:56.420
You're not going to
cancel this fundraiser.

01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:59.118
You worked way
too hard for this.

01:07:59.162 --> 01:08:01.381
I don't want to, but I'm not
gonna put our family

01:08:01.425 --> 01:08:03.688
or the guests in danger.

01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:05.516
Now, until Blake is in custody

01:08:05.559 --> 01:08:07.735
we've gotta take
every precaution.

01:08:07.779 --> 01:08:09.215
I'm not gonna let her
ruin this for you

01:08:09.259 --> 01:08:11.130
or the chance to honor
your mother's memory.

01:08:11.174 --> 01:08:13.393
Unless they find Blake
before tomorrow night

01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:15.917
that's what we're doing.

01:08:15.961 --> 01:08:18.006
Listen, I understand, alright?
I totally understand.

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:22.010
But, we're not canceling
this party, okay?

01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:24.187
We'll just make sure
Walt is on top of it.

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:25.970
He's a detective.

01:08:26.014 --> 01:08:26.885
Okay?

01:08:28.843 --> 01:08:31.149
- Okay.
- Alright, let's get some sleep.

01:08:32.716 --> 01:08:34.545
- I love you.
- And I love you, honey.

01:08:43.554 --> 01:08:45.295
You sure you're gonna
need that Taser?

01:08:45.337 --> 01:08:47.122
Well, maybe, maybe not.

01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:50.343
But, uh, we can
never be too sure.

01:08:50.386 --> 01:08:52.301
Now, well, look, if you see her,
just try not to hurt her.

01:08:52.345 --> 01:08:54.868
I mean, I know she's unhinged,
but she's Stella's daughter

01:08:54.912 --> 01:08:56.175
and she really wants
to get her some help.

01:08:56.219 --> 01:08:57.872
I'll make sure
she doesn't get hurt.

01:08:57.916 --> 01:08:58.872
Alright, thanks, man,
appreciate it.

01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:00.919
Hey, man, you guys are family.

01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:02.660
I'd do anything
to protect you guys.

01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:08.578
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

01:09:08.622 --> 01:09:09.841
Are you kidding?

01:09:09.884 --> 01:09:11.103
I love every minute I get

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.104
to spend with my favorite boys.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:16.542
Oh, they love you too. Trust me.

01:09:16.587 --> 01:09:18.371
You just call me, okay,
if you hear anything

01:09:18.415 --> 01:09:19.764
and we'll be here in
less than a minute.

01:09:19.807 --> 01:09:21.287
I got it.

01:09:21.331 --> 01:09:23.202
You just go throw
the world's best event.

01:09:24.377 --> 01:09:25.247
Okay.

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:28.685
Okay.

01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:30.600
I love you.

01:09:30.644 --> 01:09:31.645
Say "Bye, mommy."

01:09:33.952 --> 01:09:35.040
- Yay!
- I love you, bye. Love you all.

01:09:35.082 --> 01:09:36.563
Bye, love you too.

01:09:43.962 --> 01:09:45.746
Stella.
Stella, excuse me.

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:48.358
Ah! Final checklist, perfect.

01:09:48.401 --> 01:09:50.142
Okay, just make sure
the lanterns are lit

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:52.274
and the heaters are on standby.

01:09:52.318 --> 01:09:54.451
Did the extra piece of Dom
get delivered?

01:09:54.494 --> 01:09:55.843
Perfect,
I don't want to see anyone

01:09:55.887 --> 01:09:57.932
with an empty glass tonight.

01:09:57.976 --> 01:09:59.107
Yeah, this looks great.

01:09:59.151 --> 01:10:00.370
- Thank you.
- Of course.

01:10:01.632 --> 01:10:03.024
Ooh, it looks delicious.

01:10:03.068 --> 01:10:04.635
Let's start the rotation
at seven.

01:10:16.168 --> 01:10:18.866
It is so nice to see all of you.

01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:20.825
Thank you so much
for your generous support.

01:10:20.868 --> 01:10:21.782
Okay.

01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:24.872
Meredith.

01:10:24.916 --> 01:10:26.352
Are you having a wonderful time?

01:10:26.396 --> 01:10:29.834
Everything seems... adequate.

01:10:29.877 --> 01:10:31.227
"Adequate?"

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:33.098
The backyard
is stunning, Stella.

01:10:33.141 --> 01:10:35.405
I love the lanterns
and the crab puffs

01:10:35.448 --> 01:10:37.276
are to die for.
Who's the caterer?

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.538
I wish I could share

01:10:38.582 --> 01:10:41.193
your enthusiasm, but, um...

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:42.586
It's a little bit chilly

01:10:42.629 --> 01:10:44.240
for an event outside,
don't you think?

01:10:44.283 --> 01:10:46.416
Well, luckily we have
heat lamps on standby.

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:51.247
I need a drink.

01:10:56.034 --> 01:10:58.950
Well, looks like Meredith's
really warming up to you.

01:10:58.993 --> 01:11:00.517
Huh. Thank you.

01:11:02.388 --> 01:11:04.260
I think we're really gonna
pull this off, huh?

01:11:04.303 --> 01:11:06.044
I think you're right.
Good job.

01:11:06.087 --> 01:11:07.263
Couldn't have done it
without you.

01:11:07.306 --> 01:11:08.307
Oh, thanks.

01:11:08.351 --> 01:11:09.265
- Cheers?
- Cheers?

01:11:20.928 --> 01:11:23.322
Good evening, everyone.

01:11:23.366 --> 01:11:25.368
I think it's customary
for the host

01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:26.847
to say a few words,
don't you think?

01:11:27.979 --> 01:11:29.154
Where are you, Stella?

01:11:29.894 --> 01:11:31.722
Oh...

01:11:31.765 --> 01:11:34.420
Come on up here
and grace us with a speech.

01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:44.300
Don't be nervous.
We're all friends.

01:11:51.698 --> 01:11:53.265
Thank you, Meredith.

01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:00.620
Thank you all for coming.

01:12:00.664 --> 01:12:02.927
Your support
means the world to me.

01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:04.668
Today is the 20th anniversary

01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:06.322
of my mother's death.

01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:11.501
I hope her speech isn't as bland
as the hors d'oeuvre's, huh?

01:12:11.544 --> 01:12:13.807
She died when I was
just 18 years of age

01:12:15.069 --> 01:12:16.462
and I miss her every day.

01:12:19.944 --> 01:12:22.425
Not just because
she was my mother

01:12:22.468 --> 01:12:26.080
but because she was
one of the best people

01:12:26.124 --> 01:12:27.517
that I've ever known.

01:12:30.955 --> 01:12:32.478
When I think of my mother

01:12:32.522 --> 01:12:35.351
I don't think about
the hospital visits

01:12:35.394 --> 01:12:37.353
or how she looked at the end.

01:12:38.702 --> 01:12:40.834
Instead...

01:12:40.878 --> 01:12:43.228
I think about
the night of my senior prom.

01:12:46.449 --> 01:12:48.407
She helped me get all ready.

01:12:50.322 --> 01:12:51.541
She did my hair, this...

01:12:52.977 --> 01:12:55.196
giant '90s up do.

01:12:57.547 --> 01:12:59.462
I waited for my boyfriend
to pick me up

01:12:59.505 --> 01:13:00.550
but...

01:13:01.464 --> 01:13:02.856
he never showed.

01:13:04.597 --> 01:13:06.164
I wanted to give up
on that night

01:13:06.207 --> 01:13:08.819
and just cry in my room.

01:13:10.864 --> 01:13:13.084
But my mother wouldn't let me.

01:13:14.825 --> 01:13:17.697
Instead, she got all dressed up.

01:13:17.741 --> 01:13:19.395
She wanted to see a scary movie

01:13:19.438 --> 01:13:21.614
and...

01:13:21.658 --> 01:13:23.224
we yelled at the screen

01:13:23.268 --> 01:13:26.750
and we stuffed our faces
with popcorn.

01:13:29.317 --> 01:13:31.798
It was one of the best nights
of my life.

01:13:35.672 --> 01:13:38.544
She was the most amazing...

01:13:38.588 --> 01:13:40.285
person...

01:13:40.328 --> 01:13:41.417
in my life.

01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:47.074
And I never felt alone...

01:13:49.076 --> 01:13:50.817
as long as I had my mother.

01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:59.696
What was wrong?

01:14:01.611 --> 01:14:05.092
And that's the thing
about pancreatic cancer.

01:14:05.136 --> 01:14:07.747
There are no symptoms
until it's too late.

01:14:17.191 --> 01:14:19.019
So, no other little girls

01:14:19.063 --> 01:14:21.326
have to go through
their life alone.

01:14:23.546 --> 01:14:25.852
Thank you so much

01:14:25.896 --> 01:14:27.898
for your generous support.

01:14:35.514 --> 01:14:37.734
And on that note...

01:14:37.777 --> 01:14:38.822
let's eat.

01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:49.136
Your mother would be so proud.

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.573
I think so too.

01:14:50.616 --> 01:14:52.792
- Good job.
- Thank you, baby.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:57.667
Hey, Walt?

01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:58.972
Come grab dinner.

01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:01.061
Walt?

01:15:02.236 --> 01:15:03.586
- Ugh...
- Walt.

01:15:04.674 --> 01:15:05.979
Walt, are you okay?

01:15:07.807 --> 01:15:10.462
Blake, she's here.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:12.333
She went that way.

01:15:12.377 --> 01:15:14.161
Okay, alright,
I'm gonna get you some help.

01:15:17.077 --> 01:15:19.427
Wait! Call 911, now!

01:15:19.471 --> 01:15:21.212
Detective Tyler was
attacked at the back gate.

01:15:21.255 --> 01:15:23.083
Send someone to help him
right away.

01:15:23.127 --> 01:15:25.564
My babies.
Where are my babies?

01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:44.148
Mommy's here, boys.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.719
- Let 'em go, Blake.
- Hey, mom.

01:15:55.899 --> 01:15:57.901
- Where are the boys?
- It's not about the boys.

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.643
It's about you and me.

01:16:02.253 --> 01:16:04.168
Tell me where they are,
Blake, now.

01:16:05.735 --> 01:16:08.259
Didn't you ever once
worry about me

01:16:08.302 --> 01:16:09.608
if I was safe?

01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:12.437
Blake, where are the boys?

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.395
Don't you ever care about me?

01:16:14.439 --> 01:16:15.832
Blake!

01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:17.485
Blake! Let go!

01:16:17.529 --> 01:16:18.661
No.

01:16:22.708 --> 01:16:24.362
Stop.

01:16:24.405 --> 01:16:25.581
I warned you this.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.454
- What's the hell's going on?
- Find the boys.

01:16:29.497 --> 01:16:31.021
Go, find the boys!

01:16:35.982 --> 01:16:36.853
Boys!

01:16:39.899 --> 01:16:40.813
Boys!

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:49.430
Hey, guys.
Hey, how you doing? You good?

01:16:49.474 --> 01:16:51.258
The cops are on their way, okay?

01:16:51.302 --> 01:16:52.390
It's over.

01:16:53.521 --> 01:16:55.045
I say when it's over.

01:16:55.088 --> 01:16:58.178
Please, please, honey,
you need help.

01:16:58.222 --> 01:17:00.703
I don't need help,
I need my mother.

01:17:00.746 --> 01:17:02.574
I'm right here, okay?

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.228
I'm right here, and I love you.

01:17:04.271 --> 01:17:06.273
You don't love me!

01:17:06.317 --> 01:17:07.623
It doesn't have to be like this.

01:17:07.666 --> 01:17:10.495
Blake, please.

01:17:10.538 --> 01:17:12.932
You wouldn't shoot
your own daughter.

01:17:12.976 --> 01:17:15.587
Don't, don't force me
to make that choice.

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:17.458
Don't. Stay back.

01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:21.593
I'm your own flesh and blood.

01:17:27.817 --> 01:17:29.688
Was that a gunshot?

01:17:37.478 --> 01:17:38.915
Blake...

01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:49.403
Oh, my God.
Baby, you okay?

01:17:49.447 --> 01:17:51.101
I'm okay. Where are the boys?

01:17:51.144 --> 01:17:52.755
Uh, they're fine.
They're with Georgia.

01:17:52.798 --> 01:17:54.104
Oh, my God.

01:17:54.147 --> 01:17:55.148
Oh...

01:17:56.715 --> 01:17:58.674
Hey.

01:17:58.717 --> 01:17:59.675
Oh, my...

01:18:01.459 --> 01:18:03.200
Oh, Julianna.

01:18:03.243 --> 01:18:04.723
- Baby.
- Dad!

01:18:04.767 --> 01:18:06.507
- Let's get you out of here.
- Oh, sweetheart.

01:18:06.551 --> 01:18:08.161
- Honey, are you okay?
- Come on.

01:18:08.205 --> 01:18:10.947
- I was so scared.
- I know, baby. It's okay now.

01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:13.123
- Everything's okay now.
- Oh.

01:18:13.166 --> 01:18:14.428
Oh, thank God you're here.

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.257
Oh, my gosh, honey...

01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:19.738
I had a feeling.

01:18:20.783 --> 01:18:22.175
Excuse us, please.

01:18:22.219 --> 01:18:23.742
Thank you.

01:18:43.544 --> 01:18:45.024
I don't believe this.

01:18:45.068 --> 01:18:47.070
A-actually I do believe this.

01:18:47.113 --> 01:18:49.637
It's the total disaster
that I predicted.

01:18:49.681 --> 01:18:51.944
I knew that we couldn't trust her.

01:18:52.815 --> 01:18:54.381
Excuse me?

01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:55.818
I wish I could.

01:18:55.861 --> 01:18:57.471
You've embarrassed us all.

01:18:57.515 --> 01:18:59.865
I mean, the mayor
was here tonight, for God sakes!

01:18:59.909 --> 01:19:03.739
- Meredith, it wasn't her fault!
- Of course, it was her fault.

01:19:03.782 --> 01:19:05.697
Only a classless idiot

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:08.395
would hire a psychotic nanny
that would try to murder us all.

01:19:08.439 --> 01:19:09.962
- Meredith!
- You know what, it's okay.

01:19:10.006 --> 01:19:11.311
I don't...

01:19:11.355 --> 01:19:14.445
I don't care what you think.

01:19:14.488 --> 01:19:16.229
You are a miserable person,
Meredith.

01:19:16.273 --> 01:19:17.709
And the only thing
that you have in your life

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:19.145
to make feel yourself
feel better

01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:20.625
is by trying to make
other people

01:19:20.668 --> 01:19:22.279
feel worse about their life.

01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:25.717
I'm done trying to impress you.

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.458
Uh, impress me?

01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:30.026
Just so we're clear, you failed.

01:19:30.069 --> 01:19:31.549
Just so we're clear...

01:19:32.463 --> 01:19:34.291
I don't care.

01:19:34.334 --> 01:19:37.076
Now, get your Pilates ass
out of my yard.

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.425
You're not welcome here.

01:19:38.469 --> 01:19:40.123
Fine.

01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:41.820
Come on, ladies, let's go.

01:19:47.521 --> 01:19:48.566
Fine.

01:19:58.184 --> 01:20:00.230
Remind me
not get on your bad side

01:20:00.273 --> 01:20:01.840
or wear yoga pants.

01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:02.798
Hmm.

01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:06.062
I love you.

01:20:06.105 --> 01:20:06.976
I love you, too.

01:20:19.945 --> 01:20:21.381
Let's get you out of here.

01:20:21.425 --> 01:20:22.774
Get you inside.

01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:47.668
Hey, finishing
your weekly letter to Blake?

01:20:47.712 --> 01:20:49.757
Yeah, as soon
as I get some stamps

01:20:49.801 --> 01:20:51.020
I'm gonna send it out.

01:20:51.063 --> 01:20:52.586
Oh, good.

01:20:59.115 --> 01:21:00.420
Hey, you okay?

01:21:04.381 --> 01:21:06.165
Did we do the right thing?

01:21:06.209 --> 01:21:08.646
Of course, baby,
we did the right thing.

01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:10.866
She's getting the help
she needs. Okay?

01:21:12.955 --> 01:21:13.999
Trust me.

01:21:15.958 --> 01:21:18.177
Did I ever tell you
I think you're kinda great?

01:21:18.221 --> 01:21:19.787
Well, I think you're kinda great.

01:21:21.485 --> 01:21:23.226
- Let's barbeque.
- Okay.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.101
Hey! Oh, good to see you.

01:21:29.145 --> 01:21:30.755
- So glad you made it.
- Great to see you, of course.

01:21:30.798 --> 01:21:32.713
- Hey.
- Wow, this looks great.

01:21:32.757 --> 01:21:34.977
- What's up, buddy?
- Oh, I'm so hungry.
