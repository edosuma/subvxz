07:28.960 --> 07:31.320
I'm going to ask you
some background questions.

07:32.080 --> 07:36.120
We found an asylum application
under the name Zemar Bangesh.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.880
Can you confirm that
that is the deceased's name?

07:47.040 --> 07:48.440
According to the application,

07:48.520 --> 07:53.000
Mr. Bangesh and his wife-to-be
escaped Afghanistan under threat of death

07:53.600 --> 07:57.520
because of the... [inhales]
inappropriate nature of your relationship.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.120
I take it that means
you fell in love with him

08:00.200 --> 08:03.480
-and your family didn't approve.
-Did you get the man responsible?

08:03.920 --> 08:06.800
-We have Rickard Lundgren in custody.
-Not him.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.440
You're talking about the man
Zemar said made him kill Hugo, right?

08:14.560 --> 08:15.920
He's the one responsible.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.560
How would someone go about doing that?

08:24.200 --> 08:25.640
Do you know what it means...

08:26.600 --> 08:28.080
to truly have nothing?

08:29.160 --> 08:33.000
No home, no job, no future?

08:34.720 --> 08:36.440
-To not even have a name?
-No.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.080
Zemar would go out every day
looking for money.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.440
Laboring jobs.

08:45.480 --> 08:46.320
Begging.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.880
Anything to provide for this baby.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.920
One day, he came back
with hope in his eyes.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.400
Everything was going to be okay.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.720
A man gave him a job as a driver...

09:02.280 --> 09:03.240
long-term.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.560
What-What man, Yara?

09:06.200 --> 09:07.040
I don't know.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.480
For a time...

09:11.240 --> 09:12.240
everything was good.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.600
But one night Zemar arrived late...

09:18.840 --> 09:19.760
going crazy,

09:20.560 --> 09:23.040
saying over and over again
that the job changed.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.080
-It wasn't what he was told.
-What was he told?

09:27.400 --> 09:31.480
Pick a guy up from a nightclub...
and drive him to a warehouse.

09:32.520 --> 09:33.440
Nothing more.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.720
Hugo Lundgren from The Cube.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.160
But when he got to the warehouse...

09:43.400 --> 09:45.360
this man gave him new instructions.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.600
Zemar would never harm
another living thing.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.560
-But he did.
-Because the man threatened him.

09:54.440 --> 09:57.360
He said we'd be deported
if he didn't do what he was told.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.160
How long did Zemar work for this man?

10:01.240 --> 10:02.200
Maybe two months.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.400
And in all that time
he didn't sense anything wrong?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.400
Just came out of nowhere.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.680
Maybe he did, [sniffs]
but didn't want to worry me.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.720
Why even bother with this?

10:16.920 --> 10:18.320
We all know the case is over.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.600
You've got them the killer people want.

10:21.720 --> 10:25.280
-The illegal, Sweden-hating immigrant.
-That's not true, Yara.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.840
-We believe you and we're gonna find him--
-Kurt.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.040
See?

10:32.240 --> 10:33.080
This is the system.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.120
Did Zemar ever mention explosives?

10:37.600 --> 10:41.080
Ever mention the name Eman Dodovic?
Physical description of this man?

10:41.160 --> 10:42.760
I've told you everything I know.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.880
All we wanted... was to be together.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.360
[Kurt] <i>What'll happen to her now?</i>

10:49.440 --> 10:52.720
-Migration Authority'll take it from here.
-What does that mean?

10:53.440 --> 10:56.200
-Don't tell me she's getting deported.
-I genuinely don't know.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.240
[exhales sharply] He was helping us.

10:58.320 --> 11:02.600
-He died on our watch. Now we abandon her?
-That's all for now. Thanks for coming in.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.800
We will follow this up
and be in touch if we need to.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.280

And I'll be in touch.

Lundgren's taking full responsibility.
Zemar's DNA is on its way to the lab.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.640
We expect it to match
what we found in the van.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.080
This man, how do we find him?

11:22.160 --> 11:25.400
-If he exists.
-What? You-You can't think she's lying?

11:25.480 --> 11:27.800
I didn't say that.
Zemar might've lied to her.

-Guesswork.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.960
Oh, you think Zemar planned Rosengaard
and pulled it off himself?

11:37.800 --> 11:39.240
It's our job to find the truth.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.360
It's speculative, but we'll investigate.

11:41.440 --> 11:45.640
-Does that meet with your satisfaction?
-Why did you shut me down in there?

11:46.920 --> 11:50.080
-Making promises you can't keep.
-No, I was trying to give her hope!

11:50.840 --> 11:52.680
Keep your emotions out of it,
and do your job.
