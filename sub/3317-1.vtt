The potion inflicted its cruel justice,
and she got what she richly deserved.

43:13.010 --> 43:14.553
But her body was never found.

43:14.928 --> 43:18.015
To this day, no one knows
the final resting place

43:18.098 --> 43:19.474
of Madame LaLaurie.

It's the second door

45:16.592 --> 45:18.343
Make sure you stack 'em vertically.

45:18.427 --> 45:20.012
I'm responsible for those girls.

What if something had happened?

45:21.763 --> 45:23.724
-Well, nothing did.

45:34.109 --> 45:35.402
Where are you going?

45:35.485 --> 45:37.112
Out. Don't wait up.

I have half a mind to enchant the locks
after you leave.
