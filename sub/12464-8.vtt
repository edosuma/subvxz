00:05.705 --> 00:08.507
Hello, father.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.177
How did you know I was coming?

00:12.179 --> 00:15.547
Oh, it's a new app. It's
called pinpoint your parents.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.916
It comes in handy
when they work at your school.

00:17.918 --> 00:21.620
- ( Chimes )
- Oh, by the way, mom is in the ladies room.

00:23.289 --> 00:25.257
Wait, what are you
doing here after school?

00:25.259 --> 00:28.127
As a matter of fact, dad,
I'm signing up for a team.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.962
You're signing up
for a sports team?!

00:29.964 --> 00:32.664
Oh, I thought
this day would never come!

00:32.666 --> 00:35.267
And it hasn't.

00:35.269 --> 00:39.972
I'm signing up
for the brain Olympics.

00:39.974 --> 00:42.541
It's a statewide science
competition this Saturday.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.778
Ridgewood is hosting, so it
is crucial that we represent.

00:45.780 --> 00:48.280
We're gonna get
our "neuron."

00:48.282 --> 00:50.816
- ( Giggles )
- I've always fantasized

00:50.818 --> 00:52.618
about competing
in the brain Olympics.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.087
But to win, I had
to build my dream team.

00:55.089 --> 00:58.057
I was kobe looking
for my lebron,

00:58.059 --> 01:01.160
who I recently learned
are basketball players.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.996
So I fired back, "sure, dude,

01:03.998 --> 01:06.665
your computer has
just as much ram as mine does...

01:06.667 --> 01:09.635
When the power's off!"
What?

01:11.171 --> 01:14.673
Artie, I told you
to come alone.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.710
Funny how I didn't have
to tell you the same thing.

01:18.712 --> 01:21.213
Burn!

01:21.215 --> 01:23.082
I'm really sorry.
What did you say?

01:23.084 --> 01:25.084
I couldn't hear you
over the deafening sound

01:25.086 --> 01:26.718
of how epic I am.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.254
Boo!

01:29.256 --> 01:31.323
Write that down.
That was good.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.094
- What do you want, Rooney?
- Two words:

01:35.096 --> 01:37.963
Brain Olympics.

01:40.066 --> 01:42.167
Leave us.

01:44.003 --> 01:45.871
I'm building a dream team.

01:45.873 --> 01:49.708
I want to combine my expertise
in robotics and tasty snacks

01:49.710 --> 01:51.677
and yours in aerodynamics

01:51.679 --> 01:54.012
and speedy bathroom breaks.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.614
We could form...

01:55.616 --> 01:58.283
An uneasy alliance,
carefully knit together

01:58.285 --> 01:59.952
for our greater glory.

01:59.954 --> 02:02.020
Exactly.

02:02.022 --> 02:05.390
You, me and a third
teammate who complements

02:05.392 --> 02:07.759
but doesn't get in the way.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.195
We will completely dominate.

02:10.197 --> 02:13.265
- I'm in.
- Spit shake?

02:17.337 --> 02:19.238
- Uggggh.
- So bad.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.706
Yeah, why'd we do that?

02:23.309 --> 02:25.310
<i>( Theme music playing )</i>

02:25.312 --> 02:27.012
<i>¶ Better in stereo</i>

02:27.014 --> 02:29.248
<i>¶ b... b... better in stereo</i>

02:29.250 --> 02:31.283
- <i>¶ I'm up with the sunshine</i>
<i>- ¶ Let's go</i>

02:31.285 --> 02:33.285
- <i>¶ I lace up my high tops</i>

02:33.287 --> 02:35.654

02:35.656 --> 02:37.990

02:37.992 --> 02:40.425

03:11.392 --> 03:13.358
<i>¶ we're better in stereo.</i>

03:18.698 --> 03:21.266
So you're really
having this yard sale.

03:21.268 --> 03:24.069
Yeah, if I want to go to
Montreal with the French club,

03:24.071 --> 03:26.205
I have to raise $400.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.340
Most of this stuff
is all junk anyway.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.175
The French club trip
to Montreal

03:30.177 --> 03:33.011
is the only overnight trip
that a sophomore can go on.

03:33.013 --> 03:37.216
Berets, baguettes and my parents
are in a different country.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.051
"Bam-quoi."

03:40.220 --> 03:43.422
( Gasps ) Your first scooter?!
This is a treasure!

03:43.424 --> 03:45.490
Sell lemonade,
not your childhood.

03:46.492 --> 03:48.860
Mom thinks she's sentimental,
but the truth is

03:48.862 --> 03:50.762
she's a packrat.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.165
Oooh!
What's in here?

03:53.167 --> 03:59.371
Every single toothbrush that has
ever touched a Rooney mouth.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.241
( Sniffs )

04:02.243 --> 04:06.445
( Gasps ) No, Maddie,
you can't sell this.

04:08.348 --> 04:11.450
I've had isis
since my first apartment.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.253
It was just her and me
against the world.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.056
Still is, right, isis?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.425
( Raspy voice ) Yes, it is.

04:23.963 --> 04:26.832
Joey, the whole
entire school is buzzing

04:26.834 --> 04:29.001
about you and your
brain Olympics team.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.435
- They are?
- No.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.271
Oh.

04:32.273 --> 04:35.374
I heard you practicing your
victory speech in the bathroom.

04:35.376 --> 04:38.410
"Dear fellow brain olympians,

04:38.412 --> 04:41.113
a long time ago
in a galaxy far..."

04:41.115 --> 04:43.415
we get it, we get it!

04:44.351 --> 04:48.820
Oh no, not yet. But we don't have to
turn the roster in till tomorrow.

04:48.822 --> 04:52.257
Well, I have the perfect
teammate for... ¶ you.

04:52.259 --> 04:55.994
- Me.
- ( Laughing ) You?

04:58.097 --> 05:00.265
Yeah. I mean it's
the perfect opportunity

05:00.267 --> 05:01.600
for me to change my image.

05:01.602 --> 05:04.403
My character's name on
¶ "sing it loud!"

05:04.405 --> 05:08.273
Was Stephanie Einstein and after
four years of being on television

05:08.275 --> 05:11.376
and saying things like, "I loved
the surprise ending of 'Titanic'"

05:11.378 --> 05:14.313
people think I'm dumb
in real life, but I'm not.

05:14.315 --> 05:17.816
I mean, I'm no Einstein, but I'm
definitely no Stephanie Einstein.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.217
( Laughs )

05:19.219 --> 05:21.386
I mean I just want to be
seen as more than a cute,

05:21.388 --> 05:23.588
adorable, stylish,
talented bombshell.

05:23.590 --> 05:26.325
Let me get this straight:
You want to go from chic

05:26.327 --> 05:29.961
to geek and pull
a reverse ugly duckling.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.330
Yeah.

05:31.332 --> 05:34.232
Liv, not even a real duck

05:34.234 --> 05:36.001
would do that.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.870
Well, I just want to prove to
people that I can nerd out.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.539
I said geek, not nerd.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.574
The fact that you don't
know the difference

05:42.576 --> 05:44.576
means that you are neither.

05:46.312 --> 05:49.381
Liv is not smart enough
for the brain Olympics.

05:49.383 --> 05:52.484
I know that's harsh,
but I am a scientist

05:52.486 --> 05:54.353
and I only deal in facts.

05:55.388 --> 05:57.989
Sorry, Liv, the dream team
is for geeks only.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.592
Consider my rejection a compliment.
( Clicks tongue )

06:04.897 --> 06:07.866
Ooh, sign up for the brain
Olympics' dream team.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.435
Only one spot left.
Free pretzel if you sign up.

06:13.272 --> 06:15.374
Geeks usually love pretzels.

06:15.376 --> 06:19.378
I don't know, but we only have
five minutes to get a third member

06:19.380 --> 06:21.413
and turn in our team roster
to the science department

06:21.415 --> 06:24.576
and how long are you gonna wave that pretzel
in my grill without giving me some?

06:25.551 --> 06:27.586
Oh sorry.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.020
( Sighs )

06:32.392 --> 06:34.559
Where have all the geeks gone?

06:35.528 --> 06:37.429
I scared them off.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.131
To make sure no brainiac
took my spot

06:39.133 --> 06:41.466
in Joey and Artie's team,
I spent the day

06:41.468 --> 06:43.668
blasting holes in their geek cred.
( Exhales )

06:45.138 --> 06:48.039
I asked my brother Joey
if he prefers "Star Wars"

06:48.041 --> 06:51.376
or "star trek." He said,
"what's the difference?"

06:51.378 --> 06:53.412
Huh!

06:53.414 --> 06:57.015
Did you know that Artie
doesn't believe in time travel?

06:57.017 --> 06:59.017
Huh!
He's all "doctor who?"

06:59.019 --> 07:00.552
What?

07:00.554 --> 07:02.554
Okay, you didn't
hear this from me,

07:02.556 --> 07:05.023
but I saw Joey and Artie

07:05.025 --> 07:07.993
in the gym lifting weights.

07:11.330 --> 07:12.531
<i>( Liv humming )</i>

07:14.667 --> 07:18.503
Oh hey, smarties!
How's the dream team coming?

07:18.505 --> 07:20.472
It's not, we've got no one
and time is running out.

07:20.474 --> 07:23.041
Oh, where are my manners?

07:23.043 --> 07:24.943
Hey, girl.

07:25.896 --> 07:26.345
Ahem!

07:26.346 --> 07:31.016
Well, my offer to be the
third brain still stands.

07:32.318 --> 07:35.220
Here I go, an available brain,

07:35.222 --> 07:37.589
walking away.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.326
E=mc-squared

07:41.328 --> 07:43.595
and other smart stuff.

07:43.597 --> 07:47.432
Joey, I am not missing out
on brain Olympics.

07:47.434 --> 07:50.602
- We need that third member.
- We can't win with her.

07:50.604 --> 07:53.505
I'd rather just sign up
whoever walks by next.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.340
- Hi, Joey.
- ( Squeals )

07:57.510 --> 07:59.744
Did you get my invitation to
be sketched by my art class?

07:59.746 --> 08:02.347
I promise this time
it's a real thing.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.420
- Liv, you're in!
- ( Squeals )

08:08.422 --> 08:11.022
- Yaysies!
- Just sign here.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.124
Just please don't dot your
"I" with a smiley face.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.659
Too latesies!

08:15.596 --> 08:19.397
I need to get this down
to the science department, ugh.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.433
I can get this to the
office faster than you.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.772
Great, let's get to art class!

08:36.516 --> 08:39.017
Oh, you can't buy that.
You can't buy that!

08:40.453 --> 08:42.420
Run along.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.091
Whew, that was close.

08:47.393 --> 08:49.394
Hey, honey, look what
I just found in the garage.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.563
Your scary toilet Cat,
Maddie's pink scooter

08:51.565 --> 08:53.665
and a whole bunch
of toothbrushes.

08:53.667 --> 08:57.402
Is this the same box I found
in our shower earlier?

08:57.404 --> 08:58.503
Yes.
( Chuckles )

08:58.505 --> 08:59.771
You know, it's already sold.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.573
A... a... a lady
walking her dog

09:01.575 --> 09:03.508
had to run home
and get some cash,

09:03.510 --> 09:05.510
so she asked me to store it.
I'll take this.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.447
There was no lady.
There was no dog.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.449
There was just me,
my precious things

09:11.451 --> 09:16.187
and my husband, who needs to keep his
big hairy nose out of my business.

09:16.189 --> 09:19.357
Oh, thank you so much.
I'll put it someplace safe.

09:22.261 --> 09:24.496
Thank you so much
for helping out, willow.

09:24.498 --> 09:26.531
We are gonna have a blast
in Montreal.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.199
- <i>Oui oui, </i> Maddie.
- ( Grunts )

09:29.535 --> 09:31.403
Hey, dad, will you put this
on the table for me?

09:31.405 --> 09:33.471
Oh yeah, sure. I'll put
it in the Joey section.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.541
There's a Joey section?

09:37.610 --> 09:39.611
( Gasps )
Willow's going shopping.

09:42.481 --> 09:45.517
Hello, folks.
This is channel 4 meteorologist

09:45.519 --> 09:48.587
Johnny nimbus welcoming you
to the ridgewood high gymnasium

09:48.589 --> 09:51.156
for the brain Olympics!

09:51.158 --> 09:53.158
( Cheering )

09:54.527 --> 09:56.595
Okay, guys, huddle up.

09:56.597 --> 09:59.164
That is what
sport coaches say, right?

09:59.166 --> 10:01.166
- I don't know.
- No idea.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.402
Okay, so it's about to get
pretty crazy in here,

10:04.404 --> 10:06.438
so let's establish
the proper chain of command

10:06.440 --> 10:08.473
for all brain olympic
decisions. It goes

10:08.475 --> 10:11.142
Joey, Artie, other.

10:12.411 --> 10:14.446
Wait, why am I other?

10:14.448 --> 10:16.781
Joey, stop pushing me
to the sidelines.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.451
I'm here to show people
that I'm smart.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.354
We both know exactly
why you're here, Liv.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.125
I'm picking up the mad vibe
you're throwing my way.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.396
But for the sake
of the brain Olympics,

10:31.398 --> 10:33.331
we both need
to put that on pause.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.899
( Snaps ) Pause!

10:36.202 --> 10:37.402
( Snaps ) Unpause.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.371
Your hair is bouncing
and behaving.

10:40.906 --> 10:42.140
Repause.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.476
Forever pause.

10:45.511 --> 10:46.911
Wait, unpause.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.781
Thanks for the hair props.
I worked really hard.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.616
Repause.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.252
And the envelope please.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.920
( Laughs )

10:55.922 --> 10:57.522
Always wanted to say that.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.724
Though I thought it would be
at the academy awards.

10:59.726 --> 11:02.727
But we've got plenty
of razzle-dazzle right here.

11:02.729 --> 11:06.297
All right, this year's
brain Olympics challenge is

11:06.299 --> 11:09.401
build a machine
that can paint a portrait

11:09.403 --> 11:12.837
using only materials
you gather from this table.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.472
( Gasps ) Paint a portrait!

11:14.474 --> 11:16.307
Yay, I love painting!

11:16.309 --> 11:19.811
I did not get into the brain
Olympics to do... art.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.282
This is an outrage!

11:25.217 --> 11:26.885
I mean boo!

11:26.887 --> 11:29.454
This is an outrage.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.691
The best picture
of a face wins.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.259
Now, just a reminder,

11:34.261 --> 11:36.294
don't go painting
old Johnny nimbus's mug.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.297
I sold exclusive rights to my image
to a Chinese noodle company.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.366
<i>Ni hao </i> about that.

11:44.403 --> 11:46.504
Oh, Maddie honey, I think
you made a mistake.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.473
There's no way
you meant to sell this.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.408
This is your first
m.V.P. Trophy.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.976
( Snickers )

11:51.978 --> 11:53.578
Mom, that's from second grade.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.581
Literally everyone got
that trophy... even Liv.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.518
Maddie, stop this madness.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.620
I'm just telling you
I think you're gonna regret

12:02.622 --> 12:04.789
selling all
these irreplaceable items.

12:04.791 --> 12:07.258
Mom, I don't care about
this kind of junk like you do.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.526
You are such a hoarder.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.530
I am no hoarder.
I am a lover of things.

12:13.933 --> 12:18.403
Hey, care bear, I just found this
hidden in the shrubs out front.

12:20.307 --> 12:24.409
um, she was just looking at my
roses... just give me the box.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.677
Come on.

12:25.679 --> 12:27.545
- Okay.
- Mom, mom!

12:27.547 --> 12:28.813
It's over.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.650
This is where
the healing begins.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.720
Oh, I was going
to heal something.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.722
It was time for Maddie
to get some schooling.

12:41.660 --> 12:44.796
Hey, Maddie, so I was just
clearing up the clutter

12:44.798 --> 12:47.799
and I came across this hunk of junk you
made with Liv in the second grade.

12:49.735 --> 12:52.570
"Sisters by chance,
friends by choice," ugh.

12:53.539 --> 12:55.807
Just so corny.

12:55.809 --> 12:58.910
Aw, that's precious.
Did Joey help make that?

12:58.912 --> 13:01.513
Because I have... I'll
give you $100 right now.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.783
So what do you think, Maddie,
should we try to sell it?

13:04.785 --> 13:06.718
I mean, you're just
hoarding it.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.754
No sentimental value
or anything, right?

13:09.756 --> 13:11.556
I saw what she was doing.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.058
And two can play at that game.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.493
<i>( Bones crack )</i>

13:17.730 --> 13:19.731
50¢.

13:19.733 --> 13:22.467
That's twice as much
as I got for isis.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.735
( Gasps )

13:30.576 --> 13:33.578
These uniforms are
pretty sweet, huh?

13:33.580 --> 13:36.581
Ugh, I feel like a mix between
Barney and a nascar driver.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.484
- ( Hisses )
- Guys, let's focus.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.820
We have to beat
the other teams to the grab,

13:41.822 --> 13:43.721
so we need to be quick.

13:43.723 --> 13:47.492
That means keep your eyes off all
this red-hot yippy-diddy-doo.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.428
So exciting, here we go.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.730
In three, two, one.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.566
Go get 'em, geeks!

13:56.001 --> 13:58.469
( Whistling, cheering )

13:58.471 --> 14:00.505
I've got p.V.C. Pipe!

14:03.676 --> 14:05.543
Liv, what are you doing?
Put that down!

14:05.545 --> 14:07.912
- Only grab things that are useful.
- This is useful.

14:07.914 --> 14:10.348
Not for the machine
I have planned in my head.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.383
What about the machine
I have planned in my head?

14:12.385 --> 14:14.686
"Other" doesn't plan machines!

14:15.955 --> 14:19.023
Come on, Liv, you are just
not smart enough for this.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.963
Wood screws!
I've got wood screws!

14:24.965 --> 14:28.633
Fine! If I'm not
smart enough for you,

14:28.635 --> 14:31.536
then maybe I'll just
build my own machine!

14:31.538 --> 14:34.505
Great, we'll do the same.
Good luck, Einstein!

14:50.522 --> 14:53.758
- <i>( Buzzer sounds )</i>
<i>- And time is up!</i>

14:53.760 --> 14:57.128
If you didn't grab it,
you can't use it!

14:57.130 --> 15:01.466
All right, brainiacs, you've got
two hours to build a machine

15:01.468 --> 15:03.635
that will paint a portrait.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.436
And I've got two hours
to get to know

15:05.438 --> 15:08.473
the science teacher in the pantsuit.
How you doing?

15:14.079 --> 15:16.514
Another 26 bucks, coach!

15:17.583 --> 15:19.717
Why are you wearing
Joey's birthday shirt?

15:20.786 --> 15:23.021
I put the money in the box.
It's mine now.

15:24.957 --> 15:26.958
Score! I just made
an extra five bucks

15:26.960 --> 15:29.027
charging an old lady
to use our bathroom.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.563
Sweet.
We're almost at $400.

15:33.499 --> 15:34.866
Montreal, here we come.

15:34.868 --> 15:37.735
Hey, my mom's not looking.
Perfect time to sneak

15:37.737 --> 15:40.538
the sisters-by-chance picture
back up to my room. Where is it?

15:41.840 --> 15:43.942
What do you mean?
I sold that.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.777
What?

15:45.779 --> 15:48.112
Willow, that is the most
important thing that I own.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.882
But you looked right into your mom's
eyes and you said to sell it.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.217
But that's because I was trying to
get her to stop being a whackadoo!

15:53.219 --> 15:55.954
Have you never had to look
into the eyes of a whackadoo?

15:57.022 --> 15:59.190
Not until right now.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.465
With seven minutes left
in the competition,

16:07.467 --> 16:09.600
if looks like east Milwaukee
tech has already finished.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.602
Look at that!

16:11.604 --> 16:13.538
If I squint and tilt my head,

16:13.540 --> 16:15.540
I can almost see a face.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.710
Oh, and right next door,
it appears

16:18.712 --> 16:20.611
sheboygan high
has finished as well.

16:20.613 --> 16:23.147
Oh wow.

16:23.149 --> 16:27.819
I don't know about you, but
that puts a smile on my face.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.821
Boy oh sheboygan!

16:29.823 --> 16:32.190
- ( Applause )
- Hey, where are you going?

16:34.727 --> 16:38.129
Sheboygan's got this in the bag. The
slingshot will never ever work.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.999
( Sighs )
The dream is dead, Artie.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.001
I wonder what
your sister's building.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.936
Besides a freeway to my heart.

16:46.271 --> 16:50.074
Let's go check it out, if only
to make ourselves feel better.

16:56.715 --> 17:00.084
Sweet mother of Gandalf,
this machine is beautiful.

17:02.254 --> 17:04.555
Ahh, it's a catapult

17:04.557 --> 17:06.758
designed to help me launch
paint-filled balloons at the canvas

17:06.760 --> 17:08.659
using a pre-ordered 8x8 grid.

17:09.828 --> 17:12.130
You really had a machine
in your head.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.268
What's all this stuff
over here?

17:17.270 --> 17:20.772
Flair.
Someone was doubting me

17:20.774 --> 17:23.074
so I decided to add
some bells and whistles.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.710
This is awesome...
( Snaps )

17:25.712 --> 17:28.546
And I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.782
Thank you, but no!

17:32.151 --> 17:33.551
I just really can't figure out

17:33.553 --> 17:34.986
how to trigger the last stage.

17:34.988 --> 17:37.588
( Gasps ) We could use
our device as a trigger.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.657
Oh, let's team up again.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.061
I don't know, Joey.
Are you, ahem,

17:43.063 --> 17:45.129
smart enough?

17:45.131 --> 17:48.032
Whoa!
Smartie burn!

17:48.034 --> 17:49.901
( Mimics explosion )

17:49.903 --> 17:51.602
Yeah, I had that one coming.

17:51.604 --> 17:55.006
Liv, come on. You are
<i>more than smart enough.</i>

17:55.941 --> 17:58.576
But let's win
this thing together.

18:00.145 --> 18:02.346
- Fine!
- Yeah!

18:02.348 --> 18:05.349
Liv Rooney,
the former Stephanie Einstein,

18:05.351 --> 18:07.351
now had geeks begging her

18:07.353 --> 18:09.754
to lead them to the brain
Olympics championship.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.756
Role-reversal burn!

18:13.992 --> 18:16.861
I've been spending way
too much time with these nerds.

18:16.863 --> 18:20.131
Well, we've seen
every portrait but one

18:20.133 --> 18:22.633
and sheboygan is clearly
the front runner.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.702
With only 16 seconds left
to paint their canvas,

18:24.704 --> 18:27.105
will ridgewood high
make it in time?

18:27.107 --> 18:29.373
Liv, it is now or never.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.708
Do it.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.048
( Rolling )

18:46.959 --> 18:48.259
<i>( Electricity crackles )</i>

18:52.264 --> 18:53.965
Holy cow, ridgewood high

18:53.967 --> 18:56.033
built a fantastic...

18:56.035 --> 18:57.201
Flingy thingy...

18:58.804 --> 19:01.439
That made kind of a gross mess.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.375
( Beeps )

19:04.377 --> 19:06.244
<i>( Buzzes )</i>

19:08.213 --> 19:11.916
Wait, that gross mess
is Polly the porcupine.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.652
That portrait
is porcu-perfect!

19:16.855 --> 19:19.290
- ( Cheering )
- <i>And the judges have spoken.</i>

19:19.292 --> 19:21.692
Let's all give a round
of applause to this year's

19:21.694 --> 19:24.228
brain Olympics champions...
ridgewood high!

19:38.944 --> 19:40.845
Hey, any luck finding
your picture?

19:40.847 --> 19:43.781
No. I literally went
door to door to every house

19:43.783 --> 19:45.750
in the neighborhood
and no one had it.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.385
Also you would be shocked

19:47.387 --> 19:49.987
at how many people answer
the door in their underwear.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.223
If it makes you feel
any better,

19:52.225 --> 19:55.259
you earned $400 and now you get
to come to Montreal with me.

19:55.261 --> 19:57.695
How much of that 400 was
you buying Joey's stuff?

19:57.697 --> 20:00.398
It's an investment
in my future, Maddie.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.400
( Snorts )

20:02.402 --> 20:04.035
I'm sorry I sold your picture.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.137
It's okay.

20:06.139 --> 20:08.406
You were just distracted by...

20:08.408 --> 20:10.708
whatever that is
that you see in Joey.

20:12.277 --> 20:15.179
Okay well, I'm gonna head out.

20:15.181 --> 20:18.149
I gotta figure out
how to get Joey's retainer

20:18.151 --> 20:20.351
to fit my mouth.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.025
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.361
Heard you made
enough money for Montreal.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.197
Yeah.
Yeah, it's great news.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.732
What's the matter?

20:36.368 --> 20:38.869
You were just right, mom.

20:38.871 --> 20:41.005
You really can't put
a price on memories.

20:41.007 --> 20:44.308
My picture's gone
and I'm totally regretting it.

20:45.310 --> 20:48.145
Well, I'm very glad
to hear you say that,

20:48.147 --> 20:50.348
'cause it makes this moment

20:50.350 --> 20:53.317
- that much sweeter.
- ( Gasps )

20:53.319 --> 20:56.220
The picture!
You have it!

20:56.222 --> 21:00.424
- Wait, how?
- Well, I saw a lady carrying it down our driveway

21:00.426 --> 21:03.461
- and I tackled her.
- ( Laughs, snorts )

21:03.463 --> 21:06.230
I really think
I have a problem.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.968
Mama also got this back.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.170
Together forever, isis.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.139
( Raspy voice )
Forever, miss Karen,

21:15.141 --> 21:18.309
once I get rid of the others.

21:33.392 --> 21:35.359
It feels good to win,
doesn't it?

21:35.361 --> 21:38.396
And we are rocking
these velour track suits.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.798
Liv...

21:40.800 --> 21:43.100
I really need to apologize.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.369
I completely underestimated you

21:45.371 --> 21:48.439
and... I'm s-sorry.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.108
You are officially a geek.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.943
Pretzel?

21:52.945 --> 21:55.546
( Laughs ) Don't mind if I do.

22:01.386 --> 22:03.187
- ( Artie chuckles )
- Mmm.

22:03.189 --> 22:04.889
( Snaps ) Unpause.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.958
So, girl, now that
the brain Olympics are over,

22:07.960 --> 22:10.294
it's time to turn off
our brains

22:10.296 --> 22:12.396
and turn on our hearts.

22:12.398 --> 22:15.433
Ahem.
Repause, artichoke.

22:15.435 --> 22:17.468
You and me are
as likely to happen

22:17.470 --> 22:19.103
as cold fusion.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.175
So you're saying it's
theoretically possible?

22:25.377 --> 22:28.245
( Laughs ) It is so on.

22:32.484 --> 22:35.186
Well, Artie, the brain
Olympics are over.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.455
And so is our alliance.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.423
Since you clearly slept
in that track suit,

22:39.425 --> 22:41.525
it is no longer cool.

22:41.527 --> 22:44.395
It's just pajamas.

22:45.497 --> 22:47.965
Sleepwear burn!

22:49.067 --> 22:52.069
I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear you...

22:52.071 --> 22:54.305
"Over the deafening sound

22:54.307 --> 22:56.540
of how epic I am."

22:56.542 --> 22:59.443
Boom!

22:59.445 --> 23:03.547
- Hey, that's my line!
- Ha ha, but I make it work.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.483
Minions ho!

23:11.456 --> 23:13.557
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, will... oh...

23:14.960 --> 23:16.293
Dear.
