00:02.836 --> 00:05.072
♪ ♪

00:20.521 --> 00:22.689
I can't believe it.
A hundred-dollar gift card

00:22.789 --> 00:23.891
to the More Store?

00:23.991 --> 00:25.058
It's the best tip
we've ever gotten.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.093
Even better than that time

00:26.159 --> 00:27.694
that guy left us a stick of gum.

00:27.761 --> 00:28.862
-Gum guy.
-Yeah, gum guy.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.564
I can't believe we got this.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.099
It's so much money.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.534
Yeah, it's like $100.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.235
I'm kind of surprised
a guy walking around

00:35.335 --> 00:36.737
with a hundred-dollar gift card

00:36.803 --> 00:38.972
-would even want to eat here.
No offense.
-Hey.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.308
Come on, Dad, admit it.
You're confused, too.

00:41.441 --> 00:42.409
Mm, a little bit.

00:42.476 --> 00:43.877
He was probably
a tech billionaire,

00:43.977 --> 00:46.313
or an ambassador
or an influencer.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.748
They all eat food
sometimes, right?

00:47.814 --> 00:50.150
Who knows why he left this tip?
But I'm glad he did.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.786
I love the More Store.
Clothes and towels

00:52.853 --> 00:54.788
and toilet paper
an medicine and wine.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.290
And all at affordable prices.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.325
Plus, their lights are so bright
you can see if you have

00:58.392 --> 00:59.726
any weird spots on your skin.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.328
You forgot toys.
They also have toys.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.729
Nobody cares about medicine.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.131
He must have really liked
the burger.

01:04.164 --> 01:06.400
I mean, I know he did,
'cause he kept saying,

01:06.533 --> 01:08.602
"I can't believe how good
this burger is."

01:08.669 --> 01:11.405
He was maybe an angel
sent here just for me?

01:11.471 --> 01:13.540
He liked all of it, Dad.
He also talked about

01:13.640 --> 01:15.776
how great the service was,
and he definitely implied

01:15.876 --> 01:18.946
that whoever handed him the menu
did it really gracefully,

01:19.012 --> 01:19.847
and that was me.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.648
So I think I deserve
a cut of that tip.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.884
I poured his water and got
all of it in the glass.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.986
Well, most of it.
No one gets all of it in.

01:26.119 --> 01:28.622
And I took his order,
and I bet he liked

01:28.689 --> 01:29.723
having his order taken.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.191
LINDA:
Well, I served him,

01:31.291 --> 01:32.492
and he handed the card to me.

01:32.559 --> 01:35.495
Right, so it's only fair
we split it five ways.

01:35.562 --> 01:36.597
AKA splitskies.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.932
Uh, well, we normally
don't split the tips

01:39.032 --> 01:39.900
with you kids.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.569
Or pay us in any way.
Yes, we've noticed.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.037
Or another way of saying it is

01:44.104 --> 01:46.807
we spend all our money on you,
because we pay for

01:46.874 --> 01:48.208
things you do
and things you wear

01:48.275 --> 01:49.476
and the place you live.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.111
But this isn't money,
it's a gift card.

01:51.211 --> 01:54.848
So we all get to spend $20
at the More Store? Great.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.183
We've all agreed.
I love this plan.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.452
-Hmm.
-Well, you guys have
been working

01:58.552 --> 02:00.954
a little bit more,
not terribly lately.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.956
Some effort has been made,
I guess.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.759
-Thank you.
-I mean, I always try and work
as hard as I can.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.895
Shh! We're doing
collective bargaining.

02:07.995 --> 02:08.562
Oh, sorry.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.932
KIDS (harmonizing): Please.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.033
Ooh, harmony.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.401
Okay, how about this?

02:14.501 --> 02:16.870
Bus those tables and we can
split the gift card.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.305
I'm on break.
Just kidding.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.841
Tina, you heard the man.
Rub-a-dub bus-tub.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.709
-Got it.
-Mama's going shopping.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.411
-Let's go right now.
-Yay!

02:24.545 --> 02:26.547
BOTH (chanting):
Shop-ping. Shop-ping.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.316
-Shop-ping. Shop-ping.
-No, no. We're open right now.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.884
-We'll go after lunch.
-Okay.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.252
We'll just do this until we go.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.421
BOTH (chanting):
Shop-ping. Shop-ping.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.557
-Shop-ping.
-LINDA: Shop-ping! Shop-ping!

02:36.623 --> 02:37.624
-Linda.
-What?

02:37.691 --> 02:39.293
Shop-ping! Oh.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.797
LOUISE:
Hmm, no valet service
for people spending $100?

02:43.864 --> 02:45.299
By the way, can I hold the card?

02:45.365 --> 02:47.167
-No.
-Why? You don't trust me?

02:47.267 --> 02:48.402
All right, fine, but stay close,

02:48.468 --> 02:50.037
and keep your hands where
I can see 'em.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.605
Man, it's got some weight to it.

02:51.705 --> 02:52.773
Okay, give it back.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.241
-How was it?
-It was fantastic.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.475
Anyone know what
they're getting?

02:55.542 --> 02:57.244
There's so many things
to buy here.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.912
I know. Stores. Am I right?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.547
Whatever I get,
I don't want it to be

03:00.614 --> 03:01.849
something I regret later,

03:01.915 --> 03:03.584
like when I bought
that bedazzled barrette.

03:03.650 --> 03:04.852
Whoa, too much.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.353
I want to get another
slide whistle.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.589
Oh, no.
I mean, um, really?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.891
Yeah, I don't know if they
have them, but I'm thinking

03:10.958 --> 03:12.860
maybe there's a novelty
instruments department.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.128
-Well, that would be great.
-Uh-huh.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.331
I need it for my low-fi album
I'm working on.

03:17.431 --> 03:18.799
It's screaming for
some slide whistle.

03:18.899 --> 03:22.402
Wait, don't you already have
a "super fun to listen to"

03:22.503 --> 03:24.071
-slide whistle?
-I did, but I left it

03:24.171 --> 03:25.439
at that kid Mitchell's house,

03:25.506 --> 03:26.740
and we're not friends anymore,
so I can't really

03:26.840 --> 03:28.442
call up and ask for it back.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.409
Oh, yeah, Mitchell.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.011
Aw, why aren't you friends
anymore?

03:31.111 --> 03:33.046
We're not friends anymore
because he was kind of annoying.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.948
-How so?
-I mean, the slide whistle is

03:35.015 --> 03:37.885
an elegant instrument,
but when he played it, ugh.

03:37.951 --> 03:41.121
(playing rapidly)

03:44.491 --> 03:47.261
(Gene groans)

03:47.327 --> 03:50.097
It's the first time
I've ever de-friended someone,

03:50.163 --> 03:51.932
but Mitchell is just a lot,

03:51.999 --> 03:53.400
and I'm a simple, peaceful boy.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.102
-BOB: Uh-huh.
-LINDA: Yeah, uh-huh.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.271
-Okay, here we go.
-Whoa.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.439
Shopping spree,
meet shopping me.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.574
Hello. Hi.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.109
We have a hundred-dollar
gift card. No big deal.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.977
Spending someone else's money
is thrilling.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.712
-Anything could happen.
-Oh, yeah?

04:05.779 --> 04:07.214
Or I'll just get some socks.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.149
All right, we meet back at
the register in a half hour.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.052
Remember, we have $20 to spend,
that's it. No going over.

04:12.152 --> 04:16.023
-Don't forget tax, people.
-Okay, King George. Yeesh.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.860
Should I spend $20 on gumdrops?
Maybe I should.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.862
TINA:
Boyz 4 Now concert DVD box set

04:21.929 --> 04:23.664
with exclusive,
never-before-seen

04:23.730 --> 04:26.400
interviews with the band
and bonus content of the Boyz

04:26.500 --> 04:27.968
singing a song called
"Bonus Content"?

04:28.035 --> 04:30.404
I've never seen this before,
and it's only $18.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.372
Wait, is that 1,800?
Nope. Phew, good.

04:32.472 --> 04:34.474
-Nice. Put that on
your maybe list.
-What?

04:34.541 --> 04:36.777
This isn't a maybe baby.
This is a hell yeah.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.046
Tina, Tina, Tina,
it's a big store.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.615
Never go with your first choice
without looking around.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.016
That's shopping 101.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.252
This is why you always regret
everything you buy,

04:45.352 --> 04:46.553
and why you should always
listen to me,

04:46.620 --> 04:48.455
because I'm the smartest person
you know.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.556
(sighs) You're right.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.158
I'll put this on my maybe list
and keep looking.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.426
Now, we've got 27 minutes

04:52.492 --> 04:54.061
to look through
this whole store and--

04:54.127 --> 04:56.330
oh, my God-- an archery set.
I want it. I'm done.

04:56.396 --> 04:57.898
-This is what I want.
-But you just said...

04:57.998 --> 04:59.566
Yeah, that rule only applies
if there aren't

04:59.666 --> 05:01.335
amazing archery sets on sale.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.569
Ooh, 25 bucks.

05:02.669 --> 05:04.037
Uh, hey, Tina.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.306
I have a wonderful
investment opportunity for you.

05:06.373 --> 05:08.008
-Um, no thanks.
-Damn it.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.943
We could have
a beautiful life together.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.278
Can you see it?

05:13.280 --> 05:14.648
(grunting)

05:19.920 --> 05:21.622
Ooh, I'm gonna need
a trampoline, too.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.424
Wait, Tina. I'll be back to buy
you later. That's a promise.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.226
Gonna hide you back here,
so you're safe.

05:26.293 --> 05:27.694
Don't let anybody touch you.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.596
And use the arrows if necessary.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.565
Hmm. Kettlebells.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.133
I could be a kettle fella.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.935
Move to Kettle-delphia.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.303
(grunting)

05:37.337 --> 05:40.874
Hi, yeah, I need to order some
of your athletic cut T-shirts?

05:40.974 --> 05:43.110
Arm size? Uh, XXL.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.379
Oh, wait, I just went up an X.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.780
Yup, XXXL.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.248
(grunts)
That's starting to hurt.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.918
Yeah, I'm not getting this.
(grunts)

05:50.951 --> 05:52.719
Oh, this is soft.

05:52.819 --> 05:54.855
I could drool
all over this baby.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.623
Ooh, I just did a little.
(gasps)

05:56.723 --> 05:58.292
It's beautiful.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.928
The Seam Dream
3,000 Stitchinator.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.630
Features 200 unique
built-in stitches,

06:03.697 --> 06:04.998
an auto-size buttonhole

06:05.132 --> 06:06.967
and jam-resistant,
drop-in-top bobbin.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.569
Are you kidding me?
I could sew

06:08.635 --> 06:11.104
the hell out of
a Halloween costume with that.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.407
And it's on sale for 99.95.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.742
Huh, that's still
a lot more than 20.

06:15.809 --> 06:16.877
Aw, nuts.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.478
-I really want it.
-Then buy me, Linda.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.114
But we have rules,
Seam Dream 3,000 Stitchinator.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.983
Nobody can spend more than $20.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.852
But your sewing machine at home
is a piece of crap.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.222
It's not a piece of crap.
It's just kind of sort of broken

06:28.322 --> 06:30.224
and everything comes out wavy
and the needle is bent.

06:30.290 --> 06:33.660
Just convince your family
to spend all the money on me.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.862
I don't know.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.663
Think of all the stitches
we could do.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.764
-The straight stitch,
-Oh...

06:37.831 --> 06:38.899
-the basting stitch,
-Oh!

06:38.966 --> 06:40.634
-the scallop stitch,
-Scallop!

06:40.734 --> 06:41.935
-the zig-zag stich.
-Oh, God.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.904
Okay, okay, okay,
I'll ask 'em, I'll ask 'em.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.706
-The shell stitch.
-All right, all right,
you have a lot of stitches.

06:45.772 --> 06:48.275
I got to go find Bob and
the kids and get them on board

06:48.375 --> 06:51.011
with this stitch-uation.
Ha! You get it.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.513
(humming a tune)

06:52.546 --> 06:53.914
(gasps)
Oh, my.

06:53.981 --> 06:57.217
Oh, my.
Questlove, take me now.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.919
-Am I allowed to play these?
-Yep.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.121
I've never played
an electronic drum set before.

07:01.188 --> 07:04.091
Is this what NASA uses when
they need to have a space jam?

07:04.157 --> 07:05.859
Uh, I don't know.
Probably.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.694
Do I need to tie a bandana
around my head

07:07.761 --> 07:09.363
or should I just start playing?

07:09.463 --> 07:11.431
I'll just go for it.
And a one and a two,

07:11.532 --> 07:13.534
and-a you know what to d...
(gasps)

07:13.600 --> 07:14.735
Mitchell!
Oh, no.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.303
-Uh, what are you doing?
-Mitchell's here.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.472
-CLERK: I don't know
who Mitchell is.
-GENE: Mitchell was

07:18.539 --> 07:20.174
a friend of mine, but I stopped
hanging out with him

07:20.240 --> 07:21.875
because he was so annoying.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.810
Of all the More Stores
in all the world,

07:23.911 --> 07:25.712
he had to walk into this one.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.314
-I can't let him see me.
-Okay.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.815
Keep the drums warm for me,

07:28.882 --> 07:30.384
Mr. Electronics
Department Attendant.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.553
-Uh-huh.
-Just go back
to work real natural,

07:32.619 --> 07:33.754
like you never saw me.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.690
Aah! Be cool, be cool.
(grunting)

07:40.928 --> 07:42.262
-Gene, hey, Gene!
-Mom, shh!

07:42.362 --> 07:43.997
Sorry.
I like the football helmet.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.566
Is that 'cause
you're always bumping your head?

07:45.666 --> 07:48.035
No, that kid Mitchell is here
and I'm hiding from him.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.336
Oh, I get it.

07:49.436 --> 07:50.938
One time I was
at the farmer's market

07:51.004 --> 07:52.873
and I saw this mom from school
that I didn't like

07:52.973 --> 07:55.943
and I carried a big pineapple
in front of my face for an hour.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.744
Ugh, I'd kill
for a pineapple right now.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.380
Anyway, Gene, you know
how our sewing machine broke

08:00.447 --> 08:02.182
and now when I sew holes
in your pants,

08:02.249 --> 08:04.284
it's all raggedy and it looks
like you're a little orphan boy?

08:04.384 --> 08:05.719
Uh-oh, he's coming this way.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.621
Knock him down if you can.
Goodbye.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.590
Wait, Gene, scallop stitch.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.959
Ooh, Tina look at this

08:12.025 --> 08:13.861
assortment of colorful
paper clips.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.796
Aren't you always
paper clipping stuff together?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.764
Oh, and here's something
I'm just noticing.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.266
It's only ten dollars. Huh.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.869
I guess you'd have some money
left over, and you could--

08:21.969 --> 08:24.238
I don't know-- give to me?
Your baby sister,

08:24.338 --> 08:26.607
who loves you and loves
how much you love paper clips.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.976
Louise, I know you only want me
to get something cheaper

08:29.076 --> 08:30.377
'cause you want the archery set.

08:30.444 --> 08:32.779
Tina, how dare you.
I want you to be happy.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.448
That's all I've ever wanted.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.717
Ooh, a set of gel pens.
Look at all these colors.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.452
-19.95.
-Dang it.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.420
(grunts)
Oh, I think they're broken.

08:40.521 --> 08:43.056
I mean, they're pens,
so I think they're okay.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.459
But if they are broken,
I think we have to buy them.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.394
They're not broken.
They're fine. Putting them back.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.530
-And you hate them.
-(Gene grunting)

08:49.630 --> 08:51.698
Now I feel like
we're not shopping right.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.400
-Gene?
-Aah! Shh.

08:53.467 --> 08:54.735
-Get down.
-No?

08:54.801 --> 08:56.336
Then hide.
Mitchell is here.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.005
-What?
-Mitchell. He's here.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.573
Oh, whoa.
You were just talking about him

08:59.673 --> 09:01.141
-in the parking lot.
-I know.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.843
I think it's like one of those
things where if you say his name

09:02.943 --> 09:04.878
three times, he appears,
like Beetlejuice

09:04.945 --> 09:07.781
or diarrhea. All I want to do
is play the electronic drums,

09:07.848 --> 09:09.983
which are the drums of the
future, but instead I have

09:10.083 --> 09:12.019
to hide from the most annoying
boy in the world.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.954
Why did you think
he was annoying again?

09:14.021 --> 09:16.190
He was just so much,
all of the time.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.559
And it was like, "Does everyone
have to pay attention to you

09:18.625 --> 09:19.826
every second of the day?"

09:19.927 --> 09:21.495
Ooh, glow-in-the-dark
puff paint.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.130
Tina, this is
about me right now.

09:23.197 --> 09:24.598
-Me, me, me.
-Sorry.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.400
Oh, no, there he is. Let's go.

09:26.466 --> 09:28.569
(grunting)

09:28.635 --> 09:30.537
-Uh...
-Never mind.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.306
(grunting)
Come on.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.108
-Okay.
-I guess we're part of this now?

09:35.175 --> 09:36.977
A beanie hat with a headlamp.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.178
Don't mind if I do.

09:38.212 --> 09:39.513
It's getting dark.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.581
We won't be able to see.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.416
Oh, yes, we will.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.885
ALL: Wow!

09:44.985 --> 09:46.486
-TINA: You saved our family.
-BOB: Yeah.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.088
-LINDA: I love you, Bob.
-BOB: You should.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.423
LINDA: Wear that to bed tonight.

09:49.523 --> 09:50.424
Bob.

09:50.524 --> 09:51.458
-Bob.
-Oh. Hi.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.060
Nice beanie. Hey, listen.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.728
I know we're only supposed
to spend 20 bucks,

09:54.795 --> 09:57.564
but I was thinking,
what if we pooled our money

09:57.631 --> 09:59.633
and spent it all on one really
great thing for the family?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.902
You know, something
that everyone would really love.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.104
-Uh, like what?
-(sings fanfare)

10:04.171 --> 10:05.472
A sewing machine!

10:05.572 --> 10:06.707
A sewing machine?

10:06.807 --> 10:08.375
Well, not just a sewing machine.

10:08.442 --> 10:11.078
The Seam Dream 3000
Stitchinator.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.246
And it's on sale.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.614
Bob, it's like
the Michael Jordan

10:13.680 --> 10:14.915
of sewing machines.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.617
He was really good
at something, right?

10:16.683 --> 10:17.985
Yeah, he was.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.686
But you think the kids
are gonna go for that?

10:19.786 --> 10:20.954
Well, not when
you say it like that.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.056
I mean, it's just, they
might want toys.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.091
Or anything else.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.893
Okay, well, you're mean.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.195
But are you on board
with the sewing machine

10:28.262 --> 10:29.730
if I can convince everyone else?

10:29.830 --> 10:30.898
Forget I said you were mean.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.266
Uh... yeah, sure.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.901
But I'll just
keep looking around.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.538
You know, just in case the kids
want fun things that they like.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.740
Shush, shush.
Thank you for your support.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.175
Okay, I'm gonna
go find the girls.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.576
Gene'll do it if they do it.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.044
My little follower.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.280
Oh. That's disappointing.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.482
LOUISE:
So, are we gonna stay in here

10:48.582 --> 10:49.783
until the store closes?

10:49.883 --> 10:51.985
Maybe just till I'm 18 and
Mitchell goes off to college?

10:52.052 --> 10:53.420
MAN:
Come on, Mitchell. Time to go.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.555
Okay, Dad.

10:54.655 --> 10:55.989
Thank God. He's leaving.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.358
Can we go out now?
I only have about 15 minutes

10:58.425 --> 10:59.726
to cover the rest of the store.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.328
I got to chop-chop
on the shop-shop.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.630
No, no, no, no.
You don't. Because...

11:03.730 --> 11:04.865
found your winner right here.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.034
And it's a steal at $13.95.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.670
An adult male's
extra-large bathing suit?

11:09.736 --> 11:11.605
Ooh, it's got a fly for wieners.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.907
Okay, so I'm gonna go now

11:13.974 --> 11:15.509
and maybe check out
the jigsaw puzzles.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.611
Gene, you want to get
into some puzzle trouble?

11:17.644 --> 11:19.079
No, thanks.
Now that the coast is clear,

11:19.213 --> 11:21.381
I have a date
with an electronic drum set.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.417
And I'll probably get discovered
while I'm playing it

11:23.483 --> 11:25.319
and get a record deal,
if they still have those.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.687
Come with me.
We can't afford to buy it,

11:26.753 --> 11:29.056
but you owe it to yourself
to see me playing it.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.825
Okay. I think games and puzzles
is that way anyway.

11:31.959 --> 11:32.826
Sure. Puzzles.

11:32.960 --> 11:33.694
Or ChapStick.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.028
A really nice ChapStick?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.630
Like, really nice.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.198
Okay, get ready for it, people.

11:38.232 --> 11:40.234
We have, like, 13 minutes left
before we have to leave,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.769
and I need you to tell me
if I'm a prodigy or a natural

11:42.836 --> 11:44.771
or just a sweet little
drummer boy.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.073
-Mitchell!
-Gene!

11:46.139 --> 11:47.341
-I thought you left.
-What?

11:47.474 --> 11:49.209
I mean, uh, good to see you.
How are you?

11:49.276 --> 11:52.446
-Good.
-I'm also well.
Thank you for asking.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.714
You remember my sisters.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.782
-This one and that one.
-Yeah. Hey.

11:55.849 --> 11:56.950
-Hey.
-Hey.
-So, are you

11:57.017 --> 11:59.086
a frequent patron
of the More Store?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.721
I come with my dad sometimes.

12:00.754 --> 12:01.989
He came to get light bulbs,

12:02.089 --> 12:03.123
but then he got a tent,

12:03.190 --> 12:04.391
but then he forgot light bulbs.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.693
Gotcha. Um, were you
about to play these?

12:06.793 --> 12:08.729
I mean, I was gonna.
Were you?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.564
I guess. Kinda. Yeah.

12:10.631 --> 12:12.900
Do you wanna... both play?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.501
-Oh, boy.
-(whispers): Don't do it.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.770
(quietly): I don't know
what happened. It just came out.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.472
Okay...

12:18.539 --> 12:22.075
Little cramped
on this one stool. It's fine.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.815
Wow. It's the world's
most uncomfortable duet.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.685
-More like don't-et.
-Yup.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.025
(playing haltingly)

12:39.226 --> 12:40.827
This is painful to watch.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.162
And listen to.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.766
Should we take the sticks
out of their hands?

12:45.832 --> 12:47.501
Or pull the fire alarm
or something?

12:47.568 --> 12:49.203
This is... fun.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.406
-Yup.
-I'm very glad
we're doing this together.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.475
-Uh-huh.
-What happens if I turn this?

12:55.576 --> 12:57.311
-(synthesized sounds)
-Pretty cool.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.847
Yup. Liking that.
That's working for me.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.381
Hel-lo!

13:01.448 --> 13:03.584
(scatting)

13:03.717 --> 13:05.552
(Mitchell scatting)

13:06.653 --> 13:10.023
-Yes! (scatting)
-(scatting)

13:10.090 --> 13:13.493
Huh. They seem to be enjoying
themselves, somehow?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.863
But we don't
have to still be here, right?

13:15.896 --> 13:18.065
Let's say no.
Gene, we're going...

13:18.131 --> 13:19.566
-away now.
-Goodbye.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.668
Can you believe we've never
played one of these things?

13:21.768 --> 13:24.371
Mitchell, you've never played
one of these things, have you?

13:24.438 --> 13:25.672
Nope, first time.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.174
How are we so good at this?

13:27.241 --> 13:29.643
I'm not surprised.
(scatting)

13:29.710 --> 13:31.512
Hmm. (scatting)

13:31.545 --> 13:34.147
Oh, yeah?
(scatting)

13:34.248 --> 13:36.483
Okay.
(scatting loudly)

13:36.550 --> 13:38.852
(trilling, beatboxing)

13:38.952 --> 13:41.188
(beatboxing)

13:42.689 --> 13:44.224
Ugh, what is all that noise?

13:44.324 --> 13:47.027
Somebody should do something
about that. It's awful.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.095
Oh, good, the girls.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.763
Don't mess this up, Linda.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.598
-I won't.
-Just let me do the talking.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.634
I will handle it. Geez.

13:53.734 --> 13:54.668
(drumming, beatboxing continues)

13:54.735 --> 13:56.270
God, what is that?

13:57.070 --> 13:58.071
Oh. It's Gene.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.940
Sorry.
That-That's my son.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.808
He-He's a-a free spirit.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.377
Please don't kick us out
of the store.

14:03.477 --> 14:05.379
-Oh. I don't
care enough to do that.
-Um,

14:05.445 --> 14:07.414
also, do you think
these look good on me?

14:07.481 --> 14:09.917
I-I don't know how to tell
when things look good.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.018
It-It's so rare.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.820
Kind of makes me look like
a fighter pilot, right?

14:13.921 --> 14:14.421
Um...

14:14.488 --> 14:15.989
I mean, not active duty,

14:16.056 --> 14:18.192
but maybe one
who might get called back

14:18.258 --> 14:19.326
for one last mission?

14:19.393 --> 14:20.861
-Sure.
-Or if they need me

14:20.961 --> 14:23.764
to fly over a really
important sports game,

14:23.864 --> 14:25.566
-like a championship?
-Um...

14:25.699 --> 14:27.534
I think my boss is calling me.

14:27.668 --> 14:28.836
Oh. Right. Yeah.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.471
Me too.
Uh, I'm gonna put these back.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.174
I don't really
go out in the sun much.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.109
Just think
of all the wacky outfits

14:36.210 --> 14:37.778
I can sew for you kids with him.

14:37.811 --> 14:39.079
-Him?
-Yeah. He's a boy.

14:39.213 --> 14:40.614
Sewing machines can be boys.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.684
Wait, don't you still use the
sewing machine you already have?

14:43.717 --> 14:45.152
Yeah, but it's all messed-up.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.087
I never know if I'm gonna
come out alive with that thing.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.322
I think it's haunted.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.823
Sorry, Mom,
but it's a little weird

14:49.923 --> 14:51.825
to try to make us
give up our $20

14:51.959 --> 14:53.293
so that you can get your thing.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.195
Now, Tina,
what about this coloring book?

14:55.262 --> 14:57.331
Ooh, Trucks & Tractors?

14:57.431 --> 14:58.465
Only $6.99?

14:58.565 --> 14:59.666
No, Louise. Cut it out.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.401
I'm not giving you
any of my gift card money.

15:01.502 --> 15:04.104
Oh, and drapes. I've always
wanted to sew drapes.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.272
Don't kids love drapes?

15:05.339 --> 15:07.207
No. No to both of you.
Ugh!

15:07.274 --> 15:08.976
This gift card
is tearing us apart!

15:09.076 --> 15:11.211
-You blew it, Linda.
-I'm not finished.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.980
Did I mention
there was a jam-resistant

15:13.080 --> 15:14.147
drop-in top bobbin?

15:14.214 --> 15:15.983
-Yeah, a couple times.
-Mm-hmm.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.050
TINA:
Hello.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.619
English Rose Garden Puzzle?

15:18.719 --> 15:21.622
(English accent): Well, if it
isn't the finest English garden

15:21.722 --> 15:22.990
in all of England-land.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.925
♪ Tra-la-la,
tra-la-la, tra-la-la! ♪

15:24.992 --> 15:27.561
Tra-la-la to you,
my feathery garden chums.

15:27.628 --> 15:29.229
Oh. Here we go.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.330
Cheerio!

15:30.430 --> 15:31.331
Pip-pip.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.100
-(scatting)
-(playing erratically)

15:33.166 --> 15:34.401
-Mitchell!
-What?!

15:34.501 --> 15:36.103
I keep trying to play
the same beat as you,

15:36.170 --> 15:37.304
but you keep changing it.

15:37.371 --> 15:38.805
No, I don't.
You keep changing it.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.240
Fine, I'll just play louder.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.842
Then I'll play louder-er.

15:41.909 --> 15:44.645
Mitchell, you're abusing the
electronic drum set technology!

15:44.745 --> 15:47.347
You are. You should definitely
stop whatever you're doing.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.950
-You stop!
-You stop!
-(drums power off)

15:50.050 --> 15:51.685
Does that help?

15:51.752 --> 15:53.120
Ugh, I can't do this anymore!

15:53.220 --> 15:54.688
You're so annoying!

15:54.755 --> 15:57.324
This is exactly why I stopped
hanging out with you.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.258
Wait, what?

15:58.358 --> 15:59.593
I stopped hanging out with you.

15:59.660 --> 16:00.861
Because you're annoying.

16:00.961 --> 16:01.895
Uh, no.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.964
I stopped calling you.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.766
-I beg to differ.
-Don't do the thing

16:05.832 --> 16:07.935
where you hear someone stopped
wanting to hang out with you

16:08.068 --> 16:09.703
so you pretend that
you were the one who wanted

16:09.803 --> 16:10.971
to stop hanging out with them.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.207
What? You're doing that
to me right now.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.676
I left a perfectly good
slide whistle at your house

16:15.776 --> 16:17.144
because I was avoiding you!

16:17.211 --> 16:20.514
Like you even know
how to handle a slide whistle.

16:20.581 --> 16:21.982
(gasps)
How dare you!

16:22.082 --> 16:24.585
I'm leaving and I don't
ever want to see you again.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.688
I already didn't want to see you
again before I saw you here

16:27.754 --> 16:28.989
and tried not to let you see me.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.024
And, also, I'm leaving first!
(grunting)

16:31.892 --> 16:34.995
-Easy, easy.
-Damn it, what is going on
with these cords?!

16:38.799 --> 16:40.567
Hey, Gene. I guess we're
still waiting on your sisters

16:40.634 --> 16:42.803
-and your dad.
Aw, what's wrong, honey?
-Mm.

16:42.903 --> 16:45.772
Mitchell said he stopped
hanging out with me

16:45.839 --> 16:47.774
because I was the annoying one.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.643
-What?
-Yes! Can you believe it?

16:49.776 --> 16:52.112
Why would anyone ever want
to stop hanging out with you,

16:52.179 --> 16:54.281
-my sweet little angel?
-Thank you, Mother.

16:54.348 --> 16:55.616
But I'm worried you're biased.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.783
You seem to have, like,

16:56.884 --> 16:58.485
-a thing about me.
-BOB: Hey.

16:58.552 --> 16:59.853
-Socks?
-Yeah, socks.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.922
That's what I got, too.
But mine are blue.

17:02.022 --> 17:05.125
-So you didn't get the kids
on board for the sewing machine?
-No.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.393
It was a dumb idea anyway.

17:06.527 --> 17:08.362
I can keep using
the one we have now.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.163
So what if everything
comes out of it wavy

17:10.230 --> 17:12.833
with the weird scary stitching
like a psychopath did it.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.401
Hey, girls.
What'd you pick out?

17:14.468 --> 17:15.736
Well, I'm getting
this archery set,

17:15.836 --> 17:17.437
and I think
Tina's really interested

17:17.504 --> 17:18.539
in these playing cards.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.741
Sorry, kid.
This lass is about to get lost

17:20.807 --> 17:22.576
in this English garden.

17:22.643 --> 17:23.777
Trellis? Hell yes.

17:23.844 --> 17:26.413
Monster.
Gene, buddy, empty-handed?

17:26.480 --> 17:28.949
Want to gift me five dollars
of your card money?

17:29.082 --> 17:30.918
I'll let you let me shoot
an apple off your head

17:31.018 --> 17:32.286
with my new archery set.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.120
No, sorry.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.821
I got something. It's $18.95.

17:34.922 --> 17:35.822
(loud beeping)

17:35.956 --> 17:37.357
-Okay.
-Okay.
-Oh, great.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.293
That's gonna be fun
to listen to all the time.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.361
I know, right?
Oh, there he is.

17:41.461 --> 17:44.231
I can't believe he thinks
I'm the annoying one

17:44.298 --> 17:45.866
when he is clearly
the annoying one.

17:45.933 --> 17:48.635
He's loud. He can't really play
music, if we're being honest.

17:48.702 --> 17:52.372
And he has absolutely no idea
that everything he does

17:52.472 --> 17:54.541
-is extremely aggravating...
-(loud beeping)

17:54.608 --> 17:56.577
Oh, my God. He's me.

17:56.643 --> 17:57.811
ALL:
No...

17:57.845 --> 17:59.680
-We're exactly the same.
-No.
-No.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.048
-No.
-Not that much.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.316
Yes, we are!

18:02.382 --> 18:04.551
Gene, you're way less annoying
than him.

18:04.618 --> 18:05.853
A little less. A little...

18:05.953 --> 18:07.487
-way less.
-And we love you.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.523
Not just 'cause you're
our brother and we have to.

18:09.623 --> 18:11.959
Sorry, that makes it
sound like we do have to.

18:12.025 --> 18:12.559
Um, but yeah.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.027
Gene, you're not annoying.

18:14.127 --> 18:16.530
But I am remembering
Mitchell now,

18:16.597 --> 18:18.365
and he is a handful.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.634
I mean, he was.
I'm-I'm sure he's matured.

18:20.701 --> 18:22.469
Hmm. Maybe not.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.204
Well, I never thought
Mitchell was annoying.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.939
He was such a ball of energy.

18:26.006 --> 18:27.007
Lot of life in that kid.

18:27.074 --> 18:28.442
Maybe you two burn so bright,

18:28.509 --> 18:30.577
there just isn't room
for you both in one place.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.546
Yeah, it's like,
um, this puzzle.

18:32.613 --> 18:33.747
Two pieces that are similar

18:33.847 --> 18:35.148
can't go right next
to each other.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.117
They have to go far apart
in order for it to all work,

18:37.251 --> 18:39.419
and... Oh, my God,
this is a great rose garden.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.954
Look at the birdbath
on this thing.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.089
It's so freakin' quaint!

18:42.222 --> 18:43.457
Oh, boy.
He's looking over here.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.826
(sighs)
I guess I'll go say something.

18:45.926 --> 18:47.227
-Oh. Really?
-Cover me.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.396
All right.
Uh, go... serpentine.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.266
I was joking.
You're really doing it.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.034
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.402
I'm sorry we fought.

18:55.469 --> 18:57.938
I don't really think
you're annoying... that much.

18:58.005 --> 18:59.940
Same. You're just...
a little bit.

19:00.007 --> 19:02.109
Hm. We did have
some good times, didn't we?

19:02.209 --> 19:04.978
-I guess.
-And we were both amazing
at the drums.

19:05.045 --> 19:06.480
When I rock, I rock hard.

19:06.547 --> 19:09.850
Maybe we're just both so amazing
at drums and slide whistle

19:09.917 --> 19:11.785
that it's too much
if we play together.

19:11.852 --> 19:13.954
-Eh, probably.
-So we'll just play drums

19:14.021 --> 19:15.656
-and slide whistle in, uh...
-(loud beeping)

19:15.722 --> 19:17.357
separate houses and, uh, places.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.794
-(beeping continues)
-Forever. But we'll
always fondly remember

19:20.861 --> 19:22.629
the times that we...
Aah!

19:22.696 --> 19:24.965
-Mitchell, will you cut that out
for one second?!
-What?

19:25.032 --> 19:26.400
(clears throat)
Goodbye, Mitchell.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.502
-Bye.
-I'm gonna serpentine

19:28.569 --> 19:29.903
back to my family now.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.738
-How'd it go?
-Good, I guess. I think

19:31.805 --> 19:34.141
we decided that we definitely
shouldn't be friends at all.

19:34.241 --> 19:37.010
But I feel like we talked about
it like grown-up 11-year-olds.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.378
I'm proud of you, Gene.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.247
You went over there
and talked to him to make peace.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.149
That shows a lot of character.

19:42.216 --> 19:43.717
I want to be like that.

19:43.784 --> 19:45.219
Thanks.
Maybe you can call his dad

19:45.285 --> 19:46.820
and arrange to pick up
my slide whistle?

19:46.887 --> 19:48.322
No.
I-I don't see that happening.

19:48.422 --> 19:50.757
Mom, Dad, if you're both
just getting socks,

19:50.824 --> 19:53.760
does that mean there might be an
extra five bucks kicking around

19:53.861 --> 19:55.195
that we could apply
towards this?

19:55.295 --> 19:56.730
The thing that
dreams are made of?

19:56.797 --> 19:58.298
-(sighs deeply)
-Sorry, Lin.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.367
You really wanted
that sewing machine, huh?

20:00.434 --> 20:02.236
It's just,
all the dresses and pants

20:02.302 --> 20:03.604
I could've hemmed for dances.

20:03.704 --> 20:06.240
All the costumes
I could've made for Halloween.

20:06.340 --> 20:07.674
All the little outfits
I could've made

20:07.741 --> 20:08.942
for Gene's toothbrush.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.410
Remember when we used
to make outfits

20:10.477 --> 20:12.346
for Gene's toothbrush
to get him to brush?

20:12.412 --> 20:13.814
I was even thinking I could sew

20:13.914 --> 20:15.249
somebody's wedding dress
someday.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.683
-I can't wait.
-Wow, Mom.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.652
I love sewing stuff
for you kids.

20:18.719 --> 20:19.987
I want to do it forever.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.855
I love making your crazy
little dreams come true.

20:21.922 --> 20:24.124
Okay. I'm on board
with the sewing machine.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.592
-What? Really?
-(sighs)

20:25.726 --> 20:26.960
All right. I'm in, too.

20:27.027 --> 20:28.695
I guess someone else
can tend this garden.

20:28.762 --> 20:30.264
-Lucky bastard.
-Yeah, me too.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.598
I-I don't even like these socks.

20:31.665 --> 20:34.868
-Who gets new socks?
-But... archery set.

20:34.935 --> 20:36.470
That's for
the whole family, too.

20:36.570 --> 20:37.571
(sighs)

20:37.604 --> 20:39.973
Okay, fine.
Get the dang sewing machine.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.775
But someone is buying this thing
for me for my birthday

20:41.875 --> 20:44.745
-or I'm hopping the next train
to Bow and Arrow Island.
-Yay!

20:44.811 --> 20:47.214
I'll go get the Stitchinator!
You're gonna love him.

20:47.281 --> 20:49.216
I'm coming, Stitchinator!
I'm coming!

20:49.283 --> 20:50.984
-(loud crash)
-Ooh! Sorry!

20:51.051 --> 20:52.419
Ow, ow, ow.

20:52.486 --> 20:54.621
-She ran right into that cart.
-What's in there?

20:54.688 --> 20:56.123
It's like she ran into a wall.

20:56.190 --> 20:58.559
-Kettlebells.
-Look at her limpin' away.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.826
That's how you shop.
