00:29.790 --> 00:30.890
Aren't you going home yet?

00:31.630 --> 00:34.560
Go ahead. I still have some
things to do.

00:34.690 --> 00:38.600
You'll be alone here.
Will you be all right?

00:38.760 --> 00:40.260
I'll be fine.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.050
I'll keep the door locked.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.920
It's not that.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.510
Yu Ri.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.500
Don't you know?

00:47.780 --> 00:54.140
This building... has a ghost.
Haven't you heard that?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.410
I'm sorry.

01:00.650 --> 01:06.070
It's not a joke. More than one
or two people have seen it.

01:07.190 --> 01:10.170
Anyway, be sure to leave by
10:00 at the latest.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.460
Got it?

01:11.630 --> 01:12.360
Okay.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.660
Work hard.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.410
Take care going home.

01:25.360 --> 01:29.250
Regular employees are different.
They can afford to be afraid of
ghosts.

07:33.670 --> 07:34.750
Oppa.

07:35.550 --> 07:36.280
Look.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.120
Our friends sent this.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.590
It's nice, right?

07:39.590 --> 07:41.060
- It looks great!
- Right?

07:41.850 --> 07:43.040
How much longer?

07:43.060 --> 07:44.250
We're almost there.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.930
In about 1 km,

07:47.600 --> 07:49.500
we turn left here.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.970
Oppa!

08:21.830 --> 08:23.630
It's trash! Trash!

09:12.180 --> 09:14.450
That damn navigation.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.310
- Where are we?
- Oppa.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.050
Let's just go.

09:19.070 --> 09:20.240
I need a new GPS.

09:20.250 --> 09:22.360
Come on. What if something
is out here?

09:22.410 --> 09:23.500
Let's go.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.190
What?

09:26.210 --> 09:27.860
Oppa, what's this?

09:34.040 --> 09:38.140
<i>She was found last night on a
gravel road in Gyeonggi-do. </i>

09:39.650 --> 09:41.810
<i>Oh Hyeon-A, 25 years old.</i>

09:41.910 --> 09:44.380
<i>She was a graduate student
living in Mapo-dong.</i>

09:44.380 --> 09:46.950
She was reported missing
3 months ago.

09:46.980 --> 09:50.620
The strange thing is, both of her
legs are still missing.

09:50.620 --> 09:51.720
Time of death?

09:51.720 --> 09:55.760
Until the toxicology tests are done,
the NSC autopsy results won't...

09:55.760 --> 09:57.230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:57.680 --> 10:02.000
So you called us all here just to
give us her identity?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.570
First, please have a look
at the report.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.660
This report, who wrote it?

10:23.320 --> 10:26.220
What is it, Detective Jeong?
Did you find something?

10:26.250 --> 10:31.090
That arson fire, using it as the
center, it makes a spiral pattern.

10:31.110 --> 10:34.320
It gradually spreads out.

10:34.660 --> 10:37.370
<i>If you follow it backward,</i>

10:39.900 --> 10:43.100
right here... is very likely where
the first arson fire occurred.

10:43.110 --> 10:46.410
It was a trash bin or something,
not clearly an arson fire.

10:46.530 --> 10:50.810
So, it was probably never
reported to the police.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.010
We'll have to check it out
in person.

10:53.010 --> 10:54.260
That is worthy of Detective Jeong.

10:54.290 --> 10:57.050
When this case is over, should l
buy you a meal?

10:57.790 --> 11:01.090
Hey, you know the case is as
good as solved already.

11:01.470 --> 11:05.860
Just nail it down.
How about this weekend?

11:06.010 --> 11:09.900
What are you all doing on
the people's tax money?

11:15.170 --> 11:16.800
That's right.

11:18.670 --> 11:21.640
Now we might have a chance
at solving this.

11:29.050 --> 11:30.820
The Chief wants to see you.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.160
Okay.

11:32.230 --> 11:33.890
He said it's urgent.

11:35.670 --> 11:37.740
Don't you see I'm busy?

11:38.310 --> 11:42.930
I'll be right there... in a minute.

12:03.160 --> 12:06.050
Well, I guess...

12:06.980 --> 12:10.140
we're moving to the next phase.
Get ready.

12:10.460 --> 12:11.090
Yes.

-=Police Chief Lee Jeong Su=-

12:15.600 --> 12:16.880
Loyalty!

12:16.900 --> 12:18.380
Loyalty, right.

12:18.410 --> 12:20.190
What took you so long?

12:20.220 --> 12:24.770
That's really too much. I was tied
up with police business. It's not
like I was playing.

12:25.140 --> 12:28.810
What police business? You were
playing baduk online again.

12:29.170 --> 12:30.550
For you.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.640
Look at that.

12:32.900 --> 12:38.830
I'm prohibited from seeing these.
I couldn't possibly do that.

12:42.050 --> 12:45.290
You thought you'd have a good
life when you became chief.

12:45.380 --> 12:47.160
What is this?

12:47.300 --> 12:50.470
It seems like there's one big case
after another that you never

12:50.470 --> 12:52.300
get to see stamped as solved.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.520
You jerk.

12:53.910 --> 12:57.070
After wasting 3 years,

12:57.130 --> 12:59.270
now you want me back.

12:59.540 --> 13:02.060
If I can solve this case,
that's great.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.330
If not, you can throw me away.

13:06.610 --> 13:11.150
What is it? Are you running out
of cards to play, Hyeong?

13:17.230 --> 13:20.290
I'm sorry for letting you suffer
these past 3 years.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.760
Your suffering really shows.

13:23.340 --> 13:26.800
You look about 65 years old.

13:26.830 --> 13:29.370
You called me your hyeong
too easily.

13:29.410 --> 13:34.380
What are you really scheming?

13:38.180 --> 13:44.790
2 years ago, the Wide Area Search
Team was nearly destroyed by
one man.

13:44.900 --> 13:47.910
<i>The police chief covered up
the case.</i>

13:48.090 --> 13:52.860
After the case was solved, the
powerful Team 2 was disbanded.

13:55.540 --> 13:57.270
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

13:57.270 --> 13:58.730
<i>Bastard.</i>

14:04.430 --> 14:07.340
Inspector Byeon Guk Jin,
46 years old.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.480
<i>He was their tough team leader.</i>

14:10.520 --> 14:12.850
<i>He now works in the Mapo
Department.</i>

14:14.290 --> 14:15.980
Sr. Officer Lee Jong Hyeon.

14:16.010 --> 14:17.300
31 years old.

14:18.130 --> 14:20.110
<i>He was seriously injured back
then.</i>

14:20.130 --> 14:22.710
<i>After he recovered, he was
shipped off to the East district.</i>

14:51.240 --> 14:53.880
<i>Detective Yun Cheo Yong,
34 years old.</i>

14:54.080 --> 15:00.030
<i>He was known as Crazy Ghost,
and was the core strength of
Team 2.</i>

15:00.450 --> 15:02.600
<i>He's now working in the Bundang
Department.</i>

15:03.700 --> 15:07.890
Is Yun Cheo Yeong's ability
really so great?

15:17.460 --> 15:21.320
In this entire country, there are
about 20,000 first-line officers.

15:21.340 --> 15:24.620
<i>An analysis was made based on
performance and investigating
style.</i>

15:24.620 --> 15:30.680
In a short time, he received
outstanding marks in every level.
He was the only one.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.590
Who are you?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.870
What do you think?

16:58.300 --> 17:00.600
The ones who are available,

17:01.240 --> 17:03.350
are just these guys, right?

17:14.359 --> 17:15.460
It's okay.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.300
I'm a police officer.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.030
Shouldn't you give him some
tonic?

18:33.180 --> 18:35.480
I can't even snuggle with him.

18:46.470 --> 18:48.170
Byeong Tae.

18:50.620 --> 18:51.990
Behave yourself.

18:52.030 --> 18:53.920
Lose some weight in there.

18:54.230 --> 18:56.200
I'm Jackson.

18:56.430 --> 18:57.870
Right, Jackson.

18:59.210 --> 19:02.270
<i>I helped you with this case,
so keep your promise.</i>

19:03.680 --> 19:06.310
Buy some tonic for my oppas.

19:06.310 --> 19:08.330
Use that card of yours.

19:08.370 --> 19:09.610
Oppas?

19:09.640 --> 19:11.080
Tonic?

19:11.450 --> 19:12.910
Are you crazy?

19:13.010 --> 19:15.910
Client, this isn't right.

19:15.930 --> 19:18.190
A verbal agreement is legally
binding.

19:18.220 --> 19:19.460
Be quiet.

19:19.940 --> 19:21.720
Aren't you even worried?

19:21.720 --> 19:24.660
I'm not the naive Na Yeong
I was before.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.290
I've learned some things,
you know!

19:28.330 --> 19:31.630
What now? You're too busy
to even shower?

19:31.670 --> 19:33.340
You're just really...

19:33.400 --> 19:35.410
I've clearly warned you.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.930
Seriously.

19:48.050 --> 19:50.250
How rude.

19:50.250 --> 19:53.920
People who haven't been here
long try to take all the credit.

19:54.290 --> 19:57.960
Someone like that, no wonder
they were kicked out of the Wide
Area Search Team.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.180
Ajumma!

20:22.550 --> 20:24.020
One more cup here!

20:31.730 --> 20:35.030
If you're drunk, finish that and
then go home.

20:39.930 --> 20:43.400
Why are you still a detective?
How is it worthwhile?

20:46.410 --> 20:47.880
In what way?

20:51.550 --> 20:53.750
Kicked out of the Wide Area
Search Team.

20:53.750 --> 20:57.790
Because of being so damn
awesome, you're excluded by
others.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.720
-=National Police Agency

21:06.190 --> 21:08.800
What are you talking about?

21:09.350 --> 21:11.000
It's fine, it's fine.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.470
I can understand.

21:12.830 --> 21:14.300
<i>I understand.</i>

21:15.400 --> 21:17.970
<i>You'd like to give it up,
but you just can't.</i>

21:18.340 --> 21:21.640
You can't ignore whatever happens.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.110
Why?

21:24.350 --> 21:26.550
That's something only you know.

21:32.420 --> 21:36.820
You and me... should we
work together?

21:43.240 --> 21:46.370
I don't have much to do.
I like it this way.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.940
You don't have to hide anything
from me.

21:48.940 --> 21:54.810
This is a chance for you to fully
use all your abilities.

22:02.220 --> 22:03.740
I don't even drink.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.330
This guy is too much.

22:06.410 --> 22:10.260
You really have no manners.
Your supervisor actually...

22:11.330 --> 22:12.430
Ajumma!

22:12.430 --> 22:14.260
- I'm paying!
- Okay.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.500
What do you think?

23:41.290 --> 23:42.770
You...

23:44.920 --> 23:46.750
But, what are you doing here?

23:47.120 --> 23:51.890
I was suddenly transferred here.
You too?

23:56.730 --> 24:00.040
Now they're just blatantly
screwing with us.

24:01.070 --> 24:03.090
Don't you get it?

24:03.430 --> 24:06.100
They just want to make us resign.

24:06.290 --> 24:08.410
What kind of bullshit is that?

24:08.410 --> 24:10.980
This is the Special Case
Investigations team.

24:10.980 --> 24:14.280
Look around!
Where is anything special?

24:14.280 --> 24:16.850
It's nothing but a haunted house.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.370
This is the place?

24:33.370 --> 24:35.200
It looks like a haunted house.

24:36.470 --> 24:38.140
What's your problem?

24:38.140 --> 24:40.710
Didn't he say you could fully
use all your abilities?

24:40.710 --> 24:43.640
Your ability is recognized, your
performance and salary go up.

24:43.640 --> 24:44.750
Be quiet.

24:45.110 --> 24:46.580
I'm thinking. Thinking.

24:46.580 --> 24:48.780
Just listen to a woman for once.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.620
If you listened to a woman,
you'd be a lot better off.

24:50.980 --> 24:52.450
Hey, high school student!

-=Traffic Accident Investigations=-

25:13.740 --> 25:16.310

25:16.310 --> 25:18.270
Is our team back together?

25:20.420 --> 25:21.820
Team leader?

25:22.660 --> 25:23.870
Lee Jong Hyeon.

25:23.970 --> 25:26.950
See? I told you so. You should
listen to me more often.

25:26.950 --> 25:28.060
Yun Cheo Yong!

25:34.290 --> 25:37.600
Hey, Kid! See?

25:37.600 --> 25:41.270
Yun Cheo Yong is here too!
I told you that you were wrong!

25:41.270 --> 25:44.200
I thought this was the end, but
I didn't expect a counterstrike.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.240
Loyalty!

25:56.400 --> 25:59.250
This is Detective Jeong Ha Yun.

25:59.250 --> 26:02.190
She's from the intelligence branch,
so she's good at finding out things.

26:02.190 --> 26:03.660
<i>She'll be very helpful.</i>

26:06.960 --> 26:11.370
From now on, you are all the
Special Case Investigation team.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.570
No matter what happens,

26:13.570 --> 26:16.500
I will bear all the responsibility.

26:18.710 --> 26:22.380
Detective Yun's special ability,
and all team members,

26:22.380 --> 26:24.210
you are free to express your
strengths.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.520
What about it?

27:07.520 --> 27:08.620
How does it seem?

27:08.620 --> 27:12.290
This isn't a crime of passion or
anger.

27:12.290 --> 27:16.700
She wasn't just tossed away
on the gravel.

27:16.700 --> 27:20.000
She was also embalmed and
vacuum sealed.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.200
My gut feeling says serial killer.

27:23.090 --> 27:25.140
Detective Yun, what do you think?

27:25.140 --> 27:26.610
I also agree.

27:27.710 --> 27:31.750
It started on November 16 last
year, when Han Ji Su went missing.

27:31.830 --> 27:35.050
Now 3 days ago, a missing report
was filed for Lee Min Gyeong.

27:35.050 --> 27:37.620
There have been 5 women missing
altogether.

27:37.620 --> 27:42.760
A nearby CCTV recorded the
vehicle that disposed of the body.

27:42.790 --> 27:45.840
But now, apart from the type of
car, nothing else has been found.

27:48.060 --> 27:50.830
It's a very attractive female body.

27:50.900 --> 27:54.130
Smooth skin and very little fat,
right?

27:55.530 --> 27:58.170
Except for that, it's perfect.

27:58.910 --> 28:01.110
The cause of death was
strangulation.

28:01.110 --> 28:02.940
Right here, see the broken
collarbone?

28:02.940 --> 28:05.880
It's a common occurrence in
strangulation cases.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.350
Any sign of sexual assault?

28:07.350 --> 28:08.820
No trace of it.

28:08.860 --> 28:11.750
The stomach was empty, so she
hadn't eaten since going missing.

28:11.760 --> 28:13.950
Evidently, she died within a few
days of her disappearance.

28:13.980 --> 28:16.160
The victim went missing on
April 12th.

28:16.210 --> 28:19.090
That means her death occurred
roughly 3 months ago.

28:19.140 --> 28:19.970
Could...

28:19.990 --> 28:24.970
With the embalming and the
vacuum-sealed packaging, there
was no decomposition.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.070
It's strange.

28:26.070 --> 28:29.000
He dismembered and discarded
the body,

28:29.000 --> 28:33.410
but preserved it and made no
attempt to hide the victim's
identity.

28:33.640 --> 28:37.640
It seems like it was some type
of personal collection.

28:42.400 --> 28:46.200
It doesn't even show a license
plate, so what good is that?

28:46.250 --> 28:47.660
Don't you know?

28:48.820 --> 28:53.590
So people don't dump their
trash all over. It's to keep
them away.

29:00.720 --> 29:01.860
What?

29:02.960 --> 29:04.240
What is it?

29:09.070 --> 29:10.840
What's that guy doing?

29:10.840 --> 29:12.310
Watch.

29:25.160 --> 29:26.990
Stop the car! Stop!

29:41.310 --> 29:44.610
<i>If you were police, you should
have said so before.</i>

29:44.610 --> 29:46.810
What were you doing here?

29:47.180 --> 29:50.850
There are a lot of cars that
throw their trash here.

29:50.850 --> 29:52.320
I was recording them.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.970
What's this?

29:54.400 --> 29:55.990
He recorded us, too.

29:55.990 --> 29:57.820
I thought you were here to
dump trash.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.350
Make a copy.

30:04.060 --> 30:05.900
<i>Number 21.</i>

30:06.630 --> 30:08.250
Here it is.

30:09.570 --> 30:11.400
<i>Pak In Hyeok, age 28.</i>

30:11.400 --> 30:13.770
Two convictions for assault
and rape.

30:13.970 --> 30:17.280
It's posted here on his face.
You see, right?

30:17.740 --> 30:19.850
He got out of prison a year ago.

30:19.930 --> 30:23.150
<i>Since then, he's done odd jobs
and lived out of his car.</i>

30:23.150 --> 30:26.450
But yesterday, he sold his car.

30:26.450 --> 30:30.120
What did I think when I saw this?

30:30.120 --> 30:33.730
It's his last ditch effort to avoid
being tracked.

30:33.790 --> 30:38.200
To catch him, I've been running
all around and suffering so much.

30:38.200 --> 30:43.340
Aigoo. You, you, always with
the blabber, blabber.

30:45.790 --> 30:47.920
Is he blabbering again?

30:48.840 --> 30:51.780
Okay. Things are looking good.

30:51.810 --> 30:53.980
Now, let's focus on getting
Pak In Hyeok's address.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.310
Check his bank card usage
and phone records.

30:56.340 --> 30:59.120
After that, talk to his prison
friends, relatives, girlfriend.

30:59.120 --> 31:02.060
Check into even remote
connections.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.990
Jong Hyeon, you're a bloodhound.

31:31.050 --> 31:33.620
-=Victim plus legs=-

31:35.860 --> 31:37.410
Yun seonbaenim.

31:39.070 --> 31:41.330
I just can't make any sense of it.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.630
The first and second victims
haven't been found.

31:44.630 --> 31:47.300
then he did all this to dispose
of the third victim.

31:52.450 --> 31:54.170
Wait for me in the car.

31:54.170 --> 31:55.640
I'll be back soon.

31:56.100 --> 31:58.150
Where are you going?

32:16.270 --> 32:17.660
Score?

32:21.700 --> 32:23.170
An 8?

32:23.620 --> 32:24.920
Wrong.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.110
A 7.

32:26.150 --> 32:29.040
There's no way you can find a
woman like that.

32:30.510 --> 32:33.450
Such a great game, a great game.

32:33.450 --> 32:34.910
Where have you been?

32:35.280 --> 32:37.120
I've been looking for you...

32:40.050 --> 32:41.520
What's my score?

32:44.820 --> 32:46.660
It's not because you miss me,

32:46.660 --> 32:48.130
so what is it?

32:49.230 --> 32:51.060
You know Pak In Hyeok, right?

33:00.240 --> 33:03.540
You can see that guy is a
pervert, a pervert.

33:03.910 --> 33:05.380
He just looks like a pervert.

33:05.380 --> 33:07.950
He specializes in identity scams
using the homeless.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.420
Take a good look.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.680
I'm not sure.

33:11.820 --> 33:14.260
He's kind of familiar.

33:16.630 --> 33:19.550
Then again, I don't think I know.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.920
If you remember something later,
come find me.

33:27.030 --> 33:28.580
Oh, and this.

33:33.400 --> 33:36.580
Bucheon, Wonsang-gu,
Sangbae-dong 133-12.

33:37.310 --> 33:38.710
What's this?

33:39.210 --> 33:41.500
The address of a homeless shelter.

33:41.900 --> 33:45.390
It's in Bucheon.
It moved not long ago.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.520
Wait a minute!

33:58.600 --> 34:00.900
Let me see that photo again.

34:04.050 --> 34:07.410
I didn't notice before, but now
I remember.

34:07.410 --> 34:11.080
I think he's one of Gu Tae Chi's
people.

34:11.080 --> 34:11.820
<i>Here.</i>

34:11.929 --> 34:13.280
<i>Call this.</i>

34:14.080 --> 34:16.219
<i>You look very uncomfortable.</i>

34:17.400 --> 34:20.620
<i>What is your name? </i>

34:20.620 --> 34:21.719
<i>Forget it.</i>

34:23.130 --> 34:25.389
<i>He had such a dark look to him.</i>

34:25.560 --> 34:29.800
He had this huge grin watching
ladies walk by.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.000
He also had a really weird smell.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.469
Smell?

34:36.050 --> 34:38.420
<i>The smell of disinfectant.</i>

34:39.800 --> 34:41.170
Height, about 160 cm.

34:41.909 --> 34:44.110
Chest, a 75.

34:44.940 --> 34:46.310
We have a winner.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.700
That scumbag is out here
picking his next target.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.930
We should be able to smell him.

35:03.930 --> 35:06.130
Even his farts smell like
disinfectant.

35:06.320 --> 35:09.440
This bullshit makes no sense.
Why are we searching at a pool?

35:09.510 --> 35:11.640
Has Yun Cheo Yong ever
said anything ridiculous?

35:11.810 --> 35:15.310
I wouldn't dare question his
sixth sense, kid.

35:20.730 --> 35:21.920
Are you here to play?

35:22.280 --> 35:23.750
You came to look?

35:23.750 --> 35:24.850
Hey.

35:24.920 --> 35:27.050
I think he's taking photos
with his cellphone.

35:27.050 --> 35:28.520
Oh, he's a predator.

35:28.790 --> 35:30.560
What are they doing here again?

35:30.630 --> 35:32.930
Get up quickly. He's taking our
picture.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.760
<i>Let's hurry!</i>

35:38.880 --> 35:42.840
That woman, why does she keep
pointing at us?

35:43.650 --> 35:46.140
We probably look like weirdos.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.950
Excuse me.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.520
I need to check your phone.

35:58.250 --> 35:59.720
My phone?

35:59.720 --> 36:01.190
Why my phone?

36:01.190 --> 36:04.490
Those girls over there said you
were sneaking pictures of them.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.530
They think we're perverts.

36:09.630 --> 36:11.660
Hey, hey! Look, young lady!

36:12.680 --> 36:15.500
I'm on official police business!

36:16.040 --> 36:18.070
Just because I'm here with
this ajussi,

36:18.070 --> 36:19.540
I'm still doing...

36:19.540 --> 36:22.110
Hey. Stop advertising it.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.780
That guy over there.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.790
Guy with the red shirt!

36:38.530 --> 36:39.730
Stop running!

36:46.430 --> 36:48.040
Wait!

36:49.730 --> 36:52.570
Finally we go somewhere fun
and I'm not prepared.

36:52.660 --> 36:54.410
Why doesn't he answer?

36:55.910 --> 36:58.080
Oh, there he is.

37:01.190 --> 37:02.850
That guy is hiding.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.420
I know he's here somewhere.

37:05.420 --> 37:06.890
We have to find him quickly.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.170
This way.

37:09.080 --> 37:10.560
I'm dying.

37:11.290 --> 37:12.390
That kid.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.770
Oh. Where did you go...

37:22.070 --> 37:24.140
Where did you go?

37:42.950 --> 37:44.320
Found him!

37:46.890 --> 37:48.360
I found him!

37:48.360 --> 37:50.200
Over there! The flowered shirt!

37:50.200 --> 37:51.300
Hurry!

38:26.410 --> 38:28.210
Where is Lee Min Gyeong?

38:31.300 --> 38:34.610
So you're exercising your right
to remain silent.

38:35.340 --> 38:36.810
Hey, Guy.

38:36.810 --> 38:39.750
Keeping your mouth shut won't
do you any good.

38:39.750 --> 38:42.680
You've killed at least 5 women.
Five.

38:42.680 --> 38:47.450
You won't be able to squat in jail
for a few years. This is death by
firing squad. A firing squad.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.290
No.

38:49.470 --> 38:52.230
Do you have any evidence?
Evidence.

38:52.230 --> 38:53.330
Evidence?

38:55.650 --> 38:59.200
This bastard must think the
Korean police are idiots.

38:59.400 --> 39:02.500
Look, you jerk. The place you
threw away Oh Hyeon-A's body,

39:02.500 --> 39:05.070
had a CCTV and we tracked you
from that video.

39:05.070 --> 39:07.810
We found everything you had
in the box you took there.

39:07.830 --> 39:09.110
Understand?

39:12.410 --> 39:13.880
Hey, Guy.

39:14.140 --> 39:16.260
So, just be honest with us.

39:18.280 --> 39:23.620
Han Ji Su, Seong Seon Mi,
Hwang Hye Jeong, you've
already killed those girls.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.630
Lee Min Gyeong.

39:26.010 --> 39:27.830
Have you killed Lee Min Gyeong?

39:27.830 --> 39:29.420
Lee Min Gyeong?

39:30.400 --> 39:33.330
Min Gyeong, is she still alive?

39:33.330 --> 39:35.540
Who is Lee Min Gyeong?

39:37.070 --> 39:39.210
Knock it off!

39:39.240 --> 39:41.560
<i>Come here! Come here, come on!</i>

39:42.510 --> 39:47.410
I never expected it anyway.
Getting a confession from him
is hopeless.

39:48.380 --> 39:50.220
<i>That's odd. </i>

39:50.580 --> 39:53.590
He doesn't seem to know there
are more victims.

39:58.910 --> 40:01.230
There aren't any clues.

40:01.230 --> 40:02.700
There's no phone, either.

40:04.530 --> 40:07.470
In order to be that shrewd,

40:07.470 --> 40:12.240
it means he has definitely
prepared the place he does this.

40:21.240 --> 40:23.390
Ajussi, a bus card!

40:23.530 --> 40:27.410
If you check where he uses it,
you might find where he hides.

40:27.510 --> 40:30.590
Check this bus card and see
where he uses it.

40:30.670 --> 40:32.060
Okay.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.900
I've got it.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.110
It's the Gyeonggi-do outskirts
bus.

40:47.110 --> 40:50.410
You checked on Pak In Hyeok's
relatives, right?

40:51.140 --> 40:52.410
Hold on.

40:58.120 --> 41:01.420
In town, in town, in town....

41:03.130 --> 41:07.260
Pak In Hyeok's brother. There's
a warehouse under his brother's
name.

41:08.390 --> 41:09.130
-=Hye Yong Distribution=-

41:09.130 --> 41:10.540
Hye Yong Distribution?

42:27.160 --> 42:28.410
Who are all of you?

42:28.410 --> 42:29.510
What's going on here?

42:29.510 --> 42:31.340
Hey, hey, all you ajussis.

42:31.580 --> 42:37.220
Right now, you might not know if
this situation is shit or bean paste...

42:37.980 --> 42:39.050
What?

42:39.070 --> 42:40.690
You guys, over there! Quickly!

42:40.740 --> 42:42.360
Hurry! Hurry up!

42:42.470 --> 42:46.760
All of you kneel down!
Kneel! Get down there!

42:46.960 --> 42:48.230
What's all this?

42:48.230 --> 42:48.960
Seonbae.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.060
<i>Hyeongnim!</i>

42:50.920 --> 42:52.270
<i>Hyeongnim.</i>

42:55.200 --> 42:58.500
Ajussi! Outside! He's escaping!
Hurry!

42:59.240 --> 43:01.440
Seonbae!

43:21.440 --> 43:24.200
You ran a red light.
Please show me your license.

43:25.090 --> 43:27.130
Are you really a policeman?

43:28.720 --> 43:30.800
You don't want to be
a model or an actor?

43:30.800 --> 43:32.640
Have you been drinking?

43:35.400 --> 43:39.610
Why are you wasting your
God-given gifts here?

43:40.350 --> 43:41.450
Here.

43:41.740 --> 43:42.920
Please get out.

43:42.930 --> 43:45.480
You're under arrest for DUI
and bribery.

43:48.050 --> 43:52.830
As expected, whether it's man
or a woman, being tacky is not
charming.

43:52.870 --> 43:54.660
I told you to get out.

43:59.430 --> 44:00.900
Stop the car!

44:07.140 --> 44:08.240
Follow that car!

44:08.240 --> 44:09.710
- I'm an officer! Hurry!
- Yes!

44:28.890 --> 44:30.630
Who is this oppa?

44:32.470 --> 44:33.930
He's totally my dream lover.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.500
But, who are we chasing?

44:36.650 --> 44:37.600
Street racer?

44:37.600 --> 44:38.700
Serial killer?

44:39.550 --> 44:41.850
- Just drive well.
- Okay.

44:45.310 --> 44:49.350
I don't know who he is, but
he'll probably say he's innocent.

44:49.350 --> 44:51.180
This oppa is really handsome.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.750
Where has he been hiding all
this time?

45:04.760 --> 45:06.190
Hey!

45:07.080 --> 45:08.430
Don't worry.

45:08.430 --> 45:10.640
I eat street racers alive.

45:10.640 --> 45:11.740
Hold on tight.

45:30.450 --> 45:32.890
This is fun!

45:32.890 --> 45:34.730
It's just like an amusement
park ride!

46:23.980 --> 46:26.180
What the hell are you doing?

46:26.180 --> 46:27.280
<i>You're not unlocking these?</i>

46:27.280 --> 46:29.480
Are you even a cop?

46:29.870 --> 46:33.150
Anyway, in this business,
once I lose trust, I'm finished.

46:33.150 --> 46:35.720
So no matter what you do,
I can't talk.

46:36.090 --> 46:37.050
Kill me!

46:37.070 --> 46:38.660
Just kill me!

46:42.120 --> 46:43.200
Okay.

46:57.010 --> 46:58.840
Are you crazy?

46:58.880 --> 47:01.050
Why are you doing this?

47:05.920 --> 47:07.780
Hey, won't you unlock me?

47:07.860 --> 47:08.970
Unlock me!

47:09.010 --> 47:10.960
Do you think you're scaring me?

47:10.960 --> 47:12.420
No way.

47:13.890 --> 47:17.560
Hey. Stop! Stop!

47:17.600 --> 47:21.600
I'll talk, I'll talk, I'll talk!

47:24.170 --> 47:27.700
I mean, what do you want to
ask me that you have to do this?

47:27.840 --> 47:30.410
I said I'd talk, so ask.

47:34.040 --> 47:35.910
How do you know Pak In Hyeok?

47:35.910 --> 47:37.380
What's your relationship?

47:37.930 --> 47:39.590
Private vault?

47:39.710 --> 47:43.990
Pak In Hyeok used to run private
vaults for underworld types.

47:44.080 --> 47:48.390
He wasn't making much money,
so he stole something from a
client.

48:06.050 --> 48:08.210
What's in here?

48:13.350 --> 48:17.760
In Hyeok was afraid he would
die if he reported it, so he didn't.

48:17.810 --> 48:22.530
But, why would the killer put
a body in a place like that?

48:22.530 --> 48:25.460
Those guys can never ask
questions and just guard stuff.

48:25.510 --> 48:27.300
It's not much of a life for them.

48:27.300 --> 48:30.240
So, except for Oh Hyeon-A,
it's very possible...

48:30.240 --> 48:33.910
The other bodies are at
another private vault.

48:35.170 --> 48:37.940
We might have stumbled onto
something big.

48:38.040 --> 48:41.250
Catching a big fish is often by
accident.

48:41.250 --> 48:43.820
Press him hard and don't give up.

48:53.850 --> 48:56.660
<i>In Seoul, there are 6 private
vault businesses.</i>

48:56.660 --> 49:00.330
<i>Because they're inter-related,
if one is found, they all disappear
immediately.</i>

49:07.520 --> 49:10.980
<i>We're going to raid every private
vault at the same time.</i>

49:17.180 --> 49:20.120
<i>The operation will begin at exactly
10:00.</i>

51:05.910 --> 51:09.560
<i>We searched every private vault
in Seoul.</i>

51:09.620 --> 51:14.330
The dimembered bodies of
Han Ji Su, Seong Seon Mi, and
Hwang Hye Jin were found.

51:14.330 --> 51:17.270
Notice the cut surfaces on
the bodies.

51:17.330 --> 51:20.940
The perpetrator used 2 kinds
of cutting tools to dissect the
bodies.

51:20.940 --> 51:26.810
As shown on the diagram, the
cut surface is rough, presumably
from an industrial machine.

51:26.810 --> 51:30.850
In this area, it appears that a
scalpel was used.

51:30.900 --> 51:32.680
Of particular interest is this.

51:32.680 --> 51:37.450
The scalpel was used in a
different place on each victim.

51:37.490 --> 51:39.660
The scalpel was used in
different places,

51:39.700 --> 51:41.120
in what way?

51:41.610 --> 51:44.430
Hwang Hye Jin, missing at
the wrists.

51:44.430 --> 51:47.360
Seong Seon Mi was missing
her torso.

51:47.360 --> 51:50.300
You can see where parts are
missing.

51:50.340 --> 51:54.590
They're not simply missing.
The parts were collected.

51:54.610 --> 51:55.440
Yes.

51:55.440 --> 51:59.110
If the various parts were joined
together, it would look like this
diagram.

51:59.480 --> 52:00.940
-=Expected Additional Crime Sites=-

52:01.980 --> 52:07.180
The culprit is using these body
parts to build a new woman.

52:07.180 --> 52:11.960
Other than the missing Lee Min
Gyeong, there may be other
murders, right?

52:11.960 --> 52:14.160
It now appears to be a very
strong possibility.

52:20.860 --> 52:23.330
Who is the suspect?

52:25.170 --> 52:27.740
I really don't know.

52:28.110 --> 52:31.200
There's nothing to be gained
by exposing it.

52:31.220 --> 52:33.240
You need a drink while you're
working, right?

52:34.100 --> 52:35.080
<i>What? Is it coffee?</i>

52:35.100 --> 52:36.910
Strong and straight nose.

52:36.930 --> 52:38.600
Clear skin.

52:39.480 --> 52:41.690
Better looking than Min Jae oppa.

52:44.470 --> 52:45.720
Oppa!

52:45.720 --> 52:47.400
Would you just stay here?

52:47.560 --> 52:50.270
Why did you bring him over here?

52:50.290 --> 52:53.800
I'm on leave today, so just
pass everything on to me.

52:55.630 --> 52:58.200
<i>We're shorthanded, so we're
happy to have him, right?</i>

52:58.250 --> 53:02.240
<i>In any case, I think he seems
pretty clever.</i>

53:02.300 --> 53:04.440
It's been a while since I heard
my favorite lines.

53:04.440 --> 53:05.910
Anyway, I'm dog-tired,

53:05.950 --> 53:08.110
and we still haven't found
the body.

53:08.220 --> 53:11.420
Those guys don't even know
they're guarding body parts.

53:11.420 --> 53:12.880
My head hurts.

53:13.250 --> 53:14.720
I'll buy some headache pills.

53:15.660 --> 53:17.290
Let's go together!

53:18.080 --> 53:20.220
That kid is pretty sharp.

53:20.250 --> 53:22.200
He's full of initiative.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.100
Something's coming.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.940
Detective Jeong. Fax.

53:38.980 --> 53:40.490
Is it Lee Min Gyeong's
call record?

53:40.500 --> 53:42.000
Yes. Thank you.

53:42.040 --> 53:43.350
What good is that list?

53:43.350 --> 53:45.920
I thought her phone was turned
off after she disappeared.

53:46.030 --> 53:49.950
But look at this.

53:49.950 --> 53:51.790
What? Did you find something?

53:51.790 --> 53:56.560
3 days ago, Lee Min Gyeong's
phone was switched on for
30 seconds.

53:56.590 --> 53:58.030
What the heck?

54:02.880 --> 54:06.470
Mapo District, Seogyo-dong #57.

54:11.240 --> 54:16.380
Lee Min Gyeong disappeared on
the way home from work on the
19th.

54:17.110 --> 54:21.150
It was between approximately
10 and 11 p.m.

54:25.920 --> 54:28.130
Dark clouds are moving in.

54:50.510 --> 54:53.820
Is there any connection between
Lee Min Gyeong and this building?

54:54.920 --> 54:56.020
No.

54:56.020 --> 54:57.850
None, whatsoever.

54:58.960 --> 55:00.790
Does something seem strange?

55:01.530 --> 55:03.130
No.

55:05.930 --> 55:10.330
One basement level and 3 floors,
mostly businesses and offices.

55:10.630 --> 55:14.000
The 2nd and 3rd basement
levels are parking and building
maintenance.

55:14.740 --> 55:16.210
Excuse me.

55:16.980 --> 55:19.140
Where is your security office?

55:19.140 --> 55:21.340
Go that way and then turn left.

55:41.900 --> 55:45.940
-=For Lease=-

55:57.380 --> 56:00.250
Can you see anything?

56:01.490 --> 56:02.820
What do you mean?

56:02.820 --> 56:04.190
We can both see it.

56:04.290 --> 56:08.330
No. It just feels like something's
going to jump out.

56:08.330 --> 56:12.000
If it does, can you handle it?

56:49.430 --> 56:51.640
<i>Excuse me. I have something
to ask you.</i>

56:51.710 --> 56:54.200
Have you seen this woman before?

56:57.510 --> 57:00.810
<i>She's about 165 to 167 cm tall.</i>

57:53.660 --> 57:55.130
Where are you going?

57:55.210 --> 57:56.600
Let's go together.

58:35.870 --> 58:37.340
Don't move.

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:32.990
How did this...

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:39.200
I'll go down first.

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:30.950
What are you trying to tell me?

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:41.080
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:47.540
Who are you to be searching
through this building?

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:52.600
Police officer.

01:01:56.790 --> 01:01:59.580
Police or not, you need to leave.

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:03.220
Even if this place isn't haunted,
it's still killing me.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.440
Why aren't you leaving yet?

01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:00.500
Did you hear?

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.050
The new employee on the 9th
floor resigned.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.380
She said she saw a ghost while
working overtime, so she quit.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.480
Really?

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.310
<i>I heard the skincare salon on
the 3rd floor wants to leave, too.</i>

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:48.000
Help!

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.220
-=Next Episode Preview=-

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.190
<i>What are you trying to tell me?</i>

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:19.610
<i>If I had known what would happen...</i>

01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:21.220
<i>Disguised as a courier, right?</i>

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.910
<i>Who are you to be searching
through this building?</i>

01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:24.750
<i>How does that person know
my name?</i>

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.680
<i>What if there's a secret room in
the building that no one knows
about?</i>

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:32.440
<i>Able to come and go from the
building and carry boxes without
suspicion. </i>

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.620
<i>You'll be reborn as the most
beautiful woman.</i>

01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:38.660
<i>Gim Hui Yeon used Morse code
to send an SOS.</i>

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:40.200
<i>Looks like he's seen Gim Yu Ri.</i>

01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:41.740
<i>Ajussi, over here!</i>

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:42.850
<i>Look up!</i>
