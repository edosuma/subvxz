00:13.203 --> 00:14.237
Maybe I can.

00:14.271 --> 00:15.872
This is Jimmy. Can I call you?

00:15.906 --> 00:18.374
My name is Amy. Why don't
I just call you Pimento?

00:18.408 --> 00:20.042
I've said everything I can
think of to say to her.

00:20.077 --> 00:21.561
Why don't you just drive the two hours

00:21.595 --> 00:23.396
and see Robbie and
talk to her in person?

00:23.431 --> 00:24.628
I'm sorry I cheated on you.

00:24.663 --> 00:26.556
I can't take it if you
cheat on me again.

00:26.590 --> 00:27.753
Did you give Adrian money?

00:27.787 --> 00:29.280
She came to me.

00:29.314 --> 00:30.445
You must be Maria.

00:30.479 --> 00:31.711
It's nice to meet you, Amy.

00:31.745 --> 00:33.214
I've heard a lot about you.

00:33.248 --> 00:35.922
You didn't tell me you broke
up with her. It was time.

00:35.956 --> 00:37.555
I want to have a boyfriend,

00:37.590 --> 00:39.122
and I don't think you're
going to be my boyfriend.

00:39.156 --> 00:41.019
So you don't want to go out? No.

00:41.053 --> 00:43.416
Want to go back with me?
We haven't resolved anything.

00:43.451 --> 00:46.380
I want to be Amy's friend.

00:46.415 --> 00:47.947
You really are in love
with Ricky, aren't you?

00:47.982 --> 00:51.016
I guess it's about time
that we both realized

00:51.050 --> 00:54.084
we are a family, even though
you and I aren't a couple.

01:06.126 --> 01:08.593
Just hold on. I have another call.

01:08.628 --> 01:09.695
Hello?

01:09.730 --> 01:11.263
Are you in the kitchen?

01:11.297 --> 01:12.831
Would you bring me a glass of water?

01:12.865 --> 01:14.166
I'm not in the kitchen.

01:14.201 --> 01:15.268
What are you doing?

01:15.303 --> 01:17.603
I'm on the phone.

01:17.637 --> 01:18.637
Sorry.

01:25.808 --> 01:26.840
Ames?

01:26.875 --> 01:28.908
Dad, are you near the kitchen?

01:28.943 --> 01:30.809
I'm in bed. That's
near the kitchen. Why?

01:30.843 --> 01:32.610
I need a glass of water.

01:32.644 --> 01:33.777
I'm thirsty.

01:33.811 --> 01:34.777
You're thirsty, huh?

01:34.812 --> 01:39.380
Yeah. Please get me a glass of water.

01:39.414 --> 01:41.648
<i>Dad, I'm really tired,
I'm thirsty,</i>

01:41.682 --> 01:44.949
and I think I'm getting a cold.

01:44.984 --> 01:47.286
I miss Mom. I need Mom.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.988
Mom would get me a glass of water.

01:49.022 --> 01:50.956
I remember when you were a
little girl and you'd call out,

01:50.990 --> 01:52.558
asking for a glass of water,

01:52.592 --> 01:55.293
<i>when all you really wanted was someone
to talk to.</i>

01:55.328 --> 01:56.862
No, that's not it.

01:56.896 --> 01:58.298
<i>I'm thirsty.</i>

01:58.332 --> 02:00.533
Are you sure you don't
want me to read to you?

02:00.567 --> 02:01.601
What are you reading?

02:01.635 --> 02:03.369
It's a magazine about motorcycles.

02:03.404 --> 02:05.305
<i>You don't care about
motorcycles. No.</i>

02:05.340 --> 02:06.973
You miss Ben? No.

02:07.008 --> 02:09.642
I just wanted a glass of water.
Never mind.

02:09.676 --> 02:10.644
I'm on my way.

02:11.679 --> 02:12.880
Puppies, huh?

02:14.382 --> 02:15.649
I'm getting the water.

02:15.683 --> 02:16.883
I just want to finish
this article first.

02:18.319 --> 02:19.720
I swear, she's fine.

02:19.754 --> 02:21.654
<i>She's thirsty, but she's fine.</i>

02:21.689 --> 02:22.856
Why can't you get her some water?

02:22.890 --> 02:24.824
Why can't you move to
Italy to be with Maria

02:24.859 --> 02:27.126
and stop calling me about
your ex-girlfriend?

02:27.161 --> 02:28.661
We may have broken up, Amy and me,

02:28.695 --> 02:29.761
but I still care about her.

02:29.796 --> 02:30.996
Then you get her some water.

02:31.030 --> 02:32.664
She's not stranded in the Gobi desert.

02:32.698 --> 02:33.865
She's just in her room.

02:33.899 --> 02:36.467
She's a mom. She needs help. Help her.

02:36.501 --> 02:38.368
You need help.

02:46.876 --> 02:47.909
Hi, Ben.

02:47.944 --> 02:49.445
Hey, I've got something

02:49.479 --> 02:51.179
<i>that you can do for Amy. Yes, anything.
What can I do?</i>

02:51.214 --> 02:53.849
She wants some water.

02:53.883 --> 02:55.885
Are they out of water?

02:55.919 --> 02:58.354
No. She's just tired.

02:58.388 --> 02:59.355
She's in her room,

02:59.389 --> 03:01.723
<i>and she needs water. Gas? No gas?</i>

03:01.757 --> 03:03.024
What? Oh, right.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.159
<i>Bubbles, no bubbles.
Um, no bubbles.</i>

03:05.193 --> 03:07.528
Yeah, let's play it safe.
Tap water is fine.

03:07.562 --> 03:08.896
<i>Amy's green. I'm on it.</i>

03:12.935 --> 03:15.035
[phone ringing]

03:15.070 --> 03:17.404
I can't talk right now, Grace.
I have to get Amy some water.

03:17.439 --> 03:20.007
It's not Grace. It's me, honey.

03:20.041 --> 03:22.042
Oh. Sorry, Tom.

03:22.076 --> 03:24.544
I have to go, but I will
call you back. Promise.

03:24.578 --> 03:26.045
When? What?

03:26.080 --> 03:27.813
When will you call me back?

03:27.848 --> 03:29.181
Tomorrow.

03:29.216 --> 03:30.849
You said that last time.

03:30.884 --> 03:33.051
Okay, I'm not going
to call you tomorrow.

03:33.085 --> 03:35.853
I told you, I'm very
grateful for the loan,

03:35.888 --> 03:38.555
<i>but I've paid you back, and there was
nothing more to it than that.</i>

03:38.590 --> 03:40.523
No, there's more to it than that.

03:40.558 --> 03:41.891
Tom.

03:41.926 --> 03:44.527
I broke up with Tammy for you,

03:44.561 --> 03:46.896
<i>and now, I'm lonely.
Then call Tammy.</i>

03:46.930 --> 03:48.431
I have to go.

03:50.934 --> 03:53.135
No phone sex there.

03:53.170 --> 03:55.604
[phone ringing]

03:55.638 --> 03:57.573
Yes.

03:57.607 --> 03:59.408
Grace? It's me.

03:59.442 --> 04:01.744
<i>Am I interrupting sex for you?</i>

04:01.778 --> 04:03.912
I don't have anyone
to have sex with, Tom.

04:03.947 --> 04:05.748
Good.

04:05.782 --> 04:07.049
Good night.

04:17.926 --> 04:19.625
[knocking at door]

04:22.463 --> 04:24.797
I brought this for Amy,
so put that down. I got it.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.771
Hi, Amy. Here's your water.

04:31.805 --> 04:35.040
What? How did you know I wanted water?

04:35.075 --> 04:37.776
Um, it's late and you're in bed.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.112
I just figured you wanted water.

04:40.146 --> 04:41.714
I'm your friend, Amy.
I know these things.

04:41.748 --> 04:45.117
My family called you and
asked you to bring me water?

04:45.152 --> 04:46.819
Are they that lazy?

04:46.853 --> 04:50.289
No, no, really.
Your family didn't call me.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.724
Ben called me.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.960
You know, he still loves you.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.229
You could still get him back,
if you want.

04:57.263 --> 04:59.464
You're much prettier
than that Italian whore

04:59.499 --> 05:01.466
who came over here and made
an idiot out of herself.

05:01.501 --> 05:02.934
It's over.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.636
If that's how you feel,
then I'm totally behind you.

05:05.671 --> 05:08.139
Get out there and find
yourself a new guy.

05:08.173 --> 05:10.475
And I don't say that to try
to keep you away from Ricky.

05:10.509 --> 05:12.310
He and I are totally solid.

05:12.344 --> 05:14.545
I say that because I'm your friend,

05:14.579 --> 05:17.282
and once I'm someone's friend,
that's it.

05:17.316 --> 05:19.217
It's for life. Thank you.

05:19.251 --> 05:21.487
Thank you so much for the brownies

05:21.521 --> 05:23.856
and the CD and the new pencils

05:23.890 --> 05:26.793
and the gel inserts for my shoes.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.161
Aren't they great?

05:28.195 --> 05:29.529
Yeah, they're great.

05:29.564 --> 05:31.598
And isn't it great that we're friends?

05:31.633 --> 05:33.000
Oh, yeah.

05:33.034 --> 05:35.670
Yes, finally.

05:35.704 --> 05:37.505
Now will you call Ricky and tell him?

05:37.539 --> 05:39.174
I don't have a cell phone.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.275
Yes, I will call him.

05:41.744 --> 05:43.278
Now?

05:43.313 --> 05:45.781
Have a sip of your water
first if you want.

05:54.224 --> 05:56.258
Hey. Is everything okay?

05:56.292 --> 05:58.160
I just wanted to call and let you know

05:58.194 --> 06:00.462
that Adrian and I are friends.
Good night.

06:00.496 --> 06:01.730
Good night.

06:04.232 --> 06:05.733
This is a bad omen.

06:08.236 --> 06:10.570
<i>* Falling in love *</i>

06:10.605 --> 06:13.739
<i>* Is such an easy thing to do *</i>

06:13.774 --> 06:16.675
<i>* Birds can do it We can do it *</i>

06:16.710 --> 06:19.177

06:32.592 --> 06:34.326
[all] Good morning.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.660
So how are things going?

06:35.995 --> 06:37.795
It's going fine, isn't it, Madison?

06:37.830 --> 06:39.331
Jack and I aren't dating.

06:39.365 --> 06:42.200
Oh, no. What happened?
It's not because of me, is it?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.535
Oh, no, no, no.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.806
It's just-- Well,
Jack and I are just friends.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.507
and nothing more.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.209
Right, Jack?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.710
If you say so.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.378
I'll see you girls later.

06:56.915 --> 06:59.383
Why don't you take him back? No,
you can have him.

06:59.417 --> 07:01.218
Oh, no. He's not right for me.

07:01.253 --> 07:03.554
All he wants is sex.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.956
I'm really looking for a relationship.
I want to be in love.

07:05.991 --> 07:07.758
Tell me about it.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.894
Who are you talking about? Jack?

07:09.928 --> 07:11.896
I told Grace she should take him back.

07:11.930 --> 07:13.230
Yeah, you should, Grace.
He really likes you.

07:13.265 --> 07:15.566
He was just going out
with Madison for sex.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.067
Yeah, I told her.

07:17.102 --> 07:19.236
I think he was dating
me for the same reason.

07:19.270 --> 07:21.138
Hey, what's going on?

07:21.172 --> 07:23.239
Madison is trying to
give Jack back to Grace.

07:23.274 --> 07:25.842
He's not property to be given or taken,

07:25.876 --> 07:27.377
and I don't want him back.

07:27.411 --> 07:28.445
How are you doing without Ben?

07:28.479 --> 07:29.446
Okay.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.447
How's the new boyfriend?

07:30.481 --> 07:31.748
You have a new boyfriend?

07:31.783 --> 07:33.851
Jimmy. It's her mom's boyfriend's son.

07:33.885 --> 07:36.287
That doesn't sound right.
Isn't that incest?

07:36.322 --> 07:37.822
Not yet.

07:39.291 --> 07:42.594
It was a joke. I was just joking.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.264
We're not sleeping together.
We're not related.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.299
He's not really my brother.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.467
Yeah, or your boyfriend.

07:48.501 --> 07:49.701
Did you break up with Jimmy, too?

07:49.736 --> 07:51.803
Too? I didn't break up with Ben.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.372
Ben broke up with me.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.341
There you are, girlfriend.
I was looking for you.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.742
Amy and I are friends.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.044
Did she loan you money, too?

07:59.079 --> 08:00.646
I apologized for that.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.284
I borrowed money from Tom
to pay for a window I broke

08:05.318 --> 08:06.885
when I threw my cell phone through it.

08:07.987 --> 08:11.190
What? I was just trying
to throw it at Ricky.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.458
He was cheating on me.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.825
What's new? He's always cheating on you.

08:13.859 --> 08:15.627
Yeah, but that's because he's looking

08:15.661 --> 08:18.496
for that special girl who
will get along with Amy.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.765
And so I made a promise to
try and get along with Amy.

08:20.800 --> 08:25.303
And I'm getting along with Amy.
Aren't I, Amy? I love Amy.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.771
And I love John.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.006
I love this.

08:30.009 --> 08:33.178
So wait, this is supposed to
make Ricky stop cheating on you?

08:33.212 --> 08:35.313
Ricky is never going to stop cheating.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.916
No guys can cheat if he doesn't
have a woman to cheat with.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.018
And if no girls would
have sex with Ricky...

08:40.052 --> 08:41.785
Or Jack. Or Ben.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.655
My point is, guys wouldn't cheat

08:43.688 --> 08:45.156
if they didn't have
someone to cheat with,

08:45.191 --> 08:49.295
but there's always
someone willing to do it.

08:49.329 --> 08:52.331
Yeah, someone always is,
and it's not always me.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.267
No, it's not.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.269
Well, what are we supposed to do?

08:56.303 --> 08:57.804
Not do it.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.006
And we all know how hard
it is not to do it, so...

09:12.720 --> 09:14.654
What's going on over there?
I don't know,

09:14.688 --> 09:16.288
but whatever it is can't be good.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.690
When did Adrian become friends with Amy?

09:18.724 --> 09:20.191
Last week. Her dad made her.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.360
He had some crazy idea
that I cheat on Adrian

09:22.394 --> 09:26.096
because I'm looking for a girl who'll
get along with Amy. Wow, that's great.

09:26.131 --> 09:27.698
Great nothing.

09:27.732 --> 09:30.100
I don't want my girlfriend and the
mother of my baby to be friends.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.669
Adrian used to put a
lot of effort into sex

09:32.704 --> 09:34.771
because she was trying
to keep me from Amy.

09:34.806 --> 09:36.373
And that was a good thing--

09:36.407 --> 09:37.708
For me, anyway.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.310
Now all she wants to do is
talk about our relationship

09:40.344 --> 09:43.380
and intimacy and feelings and crap.

09:43.415 --> 09:44.848
We don't even have time for sex.

09:44.882 --> 09:46.583
What are you saying?
You're breaking up with Adrian?

09:46.617 --> 09:48.885
No, why? Aren't you and Madison...

09:48.919 --> 09:50.387
Nope.

09:50.421 --> 09:53.222
<i>Buon giorno.</i>

09:53.256 --> 09:54.657
I told you to drop that.

09:54.691 --> 09:56.891
I can't. It's the only
thing I have left of Maria.

09:56.926 --> 10:00.061
So you're going to try to get Amy back?

10:00.095 --> 10:02.063
No, I'm good. I'm fine.

10:02.097 --> 10:05.399
Fine? You weren't having sex
while you were with her,

10:05.434 --> 10:07.068
and now you're not
having sex without her.

10:07.102 --> 10:09.137
How are you good?
How can everything be fine?

10:09.171 --> 10:11.540
Because now I have hope
that I will have sex.

10:11.574 --> 10:13.576
When I was with Amy, there was no hope.

10:13.610 --> 10:15.277
Maria was a confidence booster.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.750
Madison was a confidence killer.

10:19.784 --> 10:20.851
We fooled around a couple times,

10:20.885 --> 10:22.686
and now she doesn't
want to go out with me.

10:22.720 --> 10:23.987
You're batting 0 for 2.

10:24.022 --> 10:25.356
At least I'm batting.

10:25.390 --> 10:26.423
TouchÃ©.

10:26.458 --> 10:27.524
I got to get in the game.

10:27.558 --> 10:28.892
Oh, no.

10:28.926 --> 10:31.261
I don't know what's going on over there,

10:31.295 --> 10:33.062
but whatever it is,
it's not good for you guys.

10:33.097 --> 10:36.098
Go over there and find
out what it is. Please?

10:43.473 --> 10:45.006
I'll see you later.

10:47.476 --> 10:49.811
Never thought it would be me, huh?

10:55.719 --> 10:58.487
What's going on? Nothing.

10:58.522 --> 10:59.622
Grace thinks she's invented something.

10:59.657 --> 11:00.790
I didn't say that.

11:00.825 --> 11:02.492
No, she didn't say that at all.

11:02.527 --> 11:03.927
I just don't agree with it.

11:03.961 --> 11:07.164
Have you ever tried it?
Of course I've tried it.

11:07.199 --> 11:08.766
Maybe you should try it again.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.967
Why didn't anyone tell me
about this before band camp?

11:11.002 --> 11:12.736
Why would someone have
to tell you about it?

11:12.770 --> 11:14.137
What?

11:14.172 --> 11:15.806
Okay, what's the only
kind of sex you can have

11:15.840 --> 11:18.976
any time you want, without any
fear of getting an STD or pregnant,

11:19.010 --> 11:20.678
or getting involved with
a guy you don't want?

11:20.712 --> 11:21.946
Masturbation.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.347
I hate that word.

11:23.381 --> 11:25.783
Really, Dr. Bowman? It's just a word.

11:25.817 --> 11:28.518
We need a new word, a nicer way of
saying it, because the M-word is just--

11:28.553 --> 11:31.822
I don't know, I can't recommend
it and use that word.

11:31.856 --> 11:34.257
And believe me, I recommend it.

11:34.292 --> 11:35.626
Oh, we believe you.

11:35.660 --> 11:38.829
So what do you guys think
about "just say me,"

11:38.863 --> 11:41.131
as a kind of code for the M-word?

11:41.165 --> 11:43.433
Kind of a campaign amongst all us girls.

11:43.467 --> 11:45.768
As a substitute for sex,
not a substitute for relationships.

11:45.803 --> 11:47.837
Don't you like it?

11:47.872 --> 11:49.272
Just say me.

11:49.307 --> 11:50.574
Compared to "Just Say No,"

11:50.608 --> 11:52.175
it's so much more
positive and practical,

11:52.210 --> 11:55.412
not to mention the other benefits, too.

11:55.446 --> 11:56.679
Studies show that it
lowers blood pressure,

11:56.714 --> 11:58.114
aids sleep, promotes relaxation.

11:58.148 --> 12:01.651
Really, I don't see a problem
when used in moderation.

12:10.094 --> 12:11.894
What?

12:11.929 --> 12:15.532
You know the 52% of guys who
aren't having sex in high school?

12:15.566 --> 12:17.501
You just went over to their team.

12:17.535 --> 12:18.568
Me too?

12:18.603 --> 12:20.737
Not you, Hank. You're with me.

12:37.172 --> 12:38.940
So none of them are going to have sex?

12:38.974 --> 12:40.942
No, they're going to have sex.

12:40.976 --> 12:42.276
Just not with you guys.

12:42.311 --> 12:45.280
Of course, Alice isn't
participating, so...

12:45.314 --> 12:47.282
Well, not like I was having sex,

12:47.316 --> 12:48.950
but if this whole campaign catches on,

12:48.985 --> 12:50.619
then I'm never going to have sex.

12:50.653 --> 12:53.856
This is bad for us, for this high
school, for high schools in general.

12:53.890 --> 12:55.957
Did you find out what
the girls are up to?

12:55.992 --> 12:57.159
Just say me.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.494
What does that mean?

12:58.528 --> 13:01.097
Just say me.

13:01.131 --> 13:02.098
You?

13:02.132 --> 13:05.001
No, not me, and not you. Not any guy.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.970
What?

13:07.004 --> 13:08.471
It was Grace's idea.

13:08.506 --> 13:11.675
The girls are going to
take care of themselves.

13:11.709 --> 13:13.343
That won't last. It could.

13:13.378 --> 13:15.312
It won't. They all want
to be in relationships.

13:15.346 --> 13:17.981
Sex is our way of making them
think they're in a relationship.

13:18.016 --> 13:21.251
Their little campaign's
not going to work.

13:22.353 --> 13:23.621
Any news from the other camp?

13:23.655 --> 13:25.322
They're staging a revolution.

13:25.356 --> 13:26.656
They're swearing off sex.

13:26.691 --> 13:28.658
No, not swearing off sex.

13:28.693 --> 13:29.926
Swearing off sex with guys.

13:29.961 --> 13:31.227
They're lesbians now?

13:31.262 --> 13:35.398
No, they're just looking
after themselves.

13:35.432 --> 13:37.299
It was Grace's idea. Thanks, Jack.

13:37.334 --> 13:38.667
I'm sorry, but you know Grace.

13:38.701 --> 13:41.670
When she likes something,
she gets behind it 1,000%.

13:41.704 --> 13:43.839
She approached religion and
sex with equal enthusiasm.

13:43.873 --> 13:46.340
But not to blow my own horn--

13:46.375 --> 13:47.809
She's not going to replace me with that.

13:47.843 --> 13:50.678
They're calling that "just say me."

13:50.712 --> 13:52.647
Really? Really.

13:52.681 --> 13:54.682
Alice says it's already all over school.

13:54.716 --> 13:55.950
It's all the girls are talking about.

13:55.984 --> 13:58.653
Great.

13:58.687 --> 14:00.455
Just say me. I like that.

14:00.489 --> 14:01.790
It's catchy.

14:01.824 --> 14:04.358
It's empowering.
It means so much more than--

14:04.393 --> 14:06.194
The M-word.

14:06.228 --> 14:08.363
It's about taking control of your life

14:08.397 --> 14:11.699
and those hormones that lead
you to make bad choices.

14:16.238 --> 14:17.371
Get in there and do something

14:17.405 --> 14:18.605
before this gets out of control.

14:18.639 --> 14:20.240
Like what? Talk to her.

14:20.274 --> 14:21.408
What am I supposed to say?

14:21.442 --> 14:23.042
Tell her you want to get back with her.

14:23.077 --> 14:24.544
Tell her you're in love or something.

14:24.578 --> 14:25.678
Do it for all of us.

14:25.713 --> 14:27.213
For all of you.

14:34.421 --> 14:35.488
Oh, jeez.

14:35.522 --> 14:37.056
What? You go talk to Adrian.

14:37.090 --> 14:38.557
She's sitting over there,
all by herself.

14:38.592 --> 14:40.392
You talk to her, she talks to Grace.

14:40.427 --> 14:41.760
Grace isn't going to listen to me.

14:55.441 --> 14:58.744
Hey, what's up?

14:58.778 --> 15:00.079
Nothing-- And nothing's going to be up.

15:00.113 --> 15:02.348
Not for a long, long time.

15:02.382 --> 15:05.585
Oh, come on. You're not supporting
this "just say me" idea, are you?

15:05.619 --> 15:07.621
I don't know. I'll let
you know in the morning.

15:07.655 --> 15:09.423
All right, let me know in the morning.

15:09.457 --> 15:11.859
But last time you held out on me,
I went somewhere else.

15:11.893 --> 15:14.094
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

15:14.129 --> 15:15.395
Hi.

15:16.931 --> 15:18.265
I'd invite you to sit down,

15:18.299 --> 15:20.934
but I saved the table for Amy,
Madison and Lauren, so...

15:20.968 --> 15:23.436
That's quite a show you're
putting on with Amy,

15:23.470 --> 15:24.803
but no one's buying it.

15:24.838 --> 15:27.439
Maybe not, but I figure

15:27.473 --> 15:29.107
if I just act like her
friend long enough,

15:29.141 --> 15:30.242
then I'll be her friend.

15:38.151 --> 15:40.920
I seriously doubt that "just
say me" is going to stop anyone

15:40.954 --> 15:42.789
from having sex with a partner.

15:42.823 --> 15:44.291
Yeah, you're right.

15:44.325 --> 15:47.261
And technically,
it's always been an option.

15:47.295 --> 15:49.129
So has just say no,

15:49.164 --> 15:51.131
but this is different from just say no.

15:51.166 --> 15:52.733
Just say no was passive.

15:52.767 --> 15:55.803
This is active. I think people
are going to jump all over this.

15:55.837 --> 15:59.473
Frankly, I think it's a
very personal choice.

15:59.508 --> 16:01.742
And we're all friends.
We can talk about this with each other,

16:01.777 --> 16:04.144
but I don't think Grace is
going to be able to launch

16:04.179 --> 16:06.880
any big campaign at school.
I mean, come on.

16:06.915 --> 16:09.683
I completely agree with Amy.

16:13.521 --> 16:17.825
So you're enrolling in the plan?

16:17.859 --> 16:18.826
It's not a plan.

16:18.860 --> 16:21.329
It's a scheme.

16:21.363 --> 16:25.500
I don't like schemes,
hijinks or shenanigans.

16:25.535 --> 16:27.502
I don't like pitting women against men,

16:27.537 --> 16:29.505
or men against women.

16:29.539 --> 16:31.173
There's no war between the sexes.

16:31.208 --> 16:34.844
We're all just people.

16:34.878 --> 16:37.980
And I don't want to separate
myself from half the population.

16:38.014 --> 16:39.548
You know, I like men.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.016
I love men.

16:41.051 --> 16:45.553
I do too, but I also love myself,

16:45.588 --> 16:47.321
if you know what I mean.

16:56.365 --> 16:58.199
What's the latest?

16:58.234 --> 17:00.668
It's spreading like wildfire.
It's got a life of its own.

17:00.703 --> 17:02.870
This is crazy. Why does
this have to happen to me

17:02.905 --> 17:04.672
right as I'm free and
ready to get out there?

17:04.707 --> 17:06.074
There's always Bologna.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.376
Take me with you next time.

17:07.410 --> 17:08.410
Or me.

17:09.479 --> 17:11.213
Not me.

17:11.248 --> 17:12.548
Whatever you do, don't take me.

17:12.582 --> 17:13.549
Ever.

17:13.583 --> 17:14.883
Watch it, Hank,

17:14.916 --> 17:16.685
or I'll be saying "just say me."

17:16.719 --> 17:17.719
Like you don't?

17:17.752 --> 17:19.954
Like you don't?

17:22.257 --> 17:24.223
Excuse me, excuse me.

17:24.259 --> 17:25.526
Where did you get that?

17:25.560 --> 17:27.694
From the "just say me" guy, Joe.

17:27.729 --> 17:29.562
But I'm the "just say me" guy.

17:29.597 --> 17:31.431
Could I talk to you for a sec?
That's mine.

17:31.465 --> 17:33.567
Joe has no right to make those stickers.

17:33.601 --> 17:34.902
He's going to make a fortune.

17:34.936 --> 17:36.370
That's money that should go to TAG,

17:36.404 --> 17:38.339
the Teen Abstinence Group.

17:38.373 --> 17:42.343
Grace Bowman, you are
so kicked out of TAG.

17:42.378 --> 17:43.344
What?

17:43.379 --> 17:44.412
You can't kick her out of TAG.

17:44.446 --> 17:45.580
My father's the head of the church,

17:45.615 --> 17:46.849
and he makes all the decisions.

17:46.883 --> 17:50.920
Oh, yeah? He's not the
president of TAG. I am.

17:50.954 --> 17:52.589
I make the decisions.

17:52.623 --> 17:55.258
And Jesus never said "just say me."

17:55.292 --> 17:56.893
He said "just say no."

17:56.927 --> 17:59.262
Jesus never said "just say no."

17:59.296 --> 18:01.464
Nancy Reagan said "just say no."

18:01.498 --> 18:03.700
Regardless, you're out.

18:07.204 --> 18:08.938
Couldn't you have sex with
me instead of all this?

18:08.973 --> 18:10.439
I don't want to have sex with you.

18:10.474 --> 18:11.841
I don't like all the complications

18:11.875 --> 18:13.610
that come from having sex with you.

18:13.644 --> 18:14.811
And it makes me feel guilty.

18:14.846 --> 18:15.812
Just say me doesn't?

18:15.847 --> 18:16.947
No, it doesn't.

18:16.981 --> 18:18.148
There's nothing wrong with it.

18:18.183 --> 18:19.550
They can't kick me out of TAG for this

18:19.584 --> 18:21.852
if they didn't kick me out
for having sex with you.

18:21.886 --> 18:24.489
Grace, "just say me" is not something
everybody's comfortable with.

18:24.523 --> 18:27.826
Okay, but everyone's comfortable with
everyone having sex with everyone else?

18:27.860 --> 18:30.061
Yeah. That doesn't make any sense.

18:30.096 --> 18:32.063
No, it does. Sex is sex.

18:32.097 --> 18:35.266
A lot of people believe you should
only have sex if you're married,

18:35.301 --> 18:37.535
and you can't marry yourself.
Therefore, you can't have sex with
yourself

18:37.569 --> 18:39.003
without breaking some rules.

18:39.037 --> 18:40.571
I'm pretty sure.

18:40.605 --> 18:43.975
Well, I'm pretty sure you
break the rules all the time.

18:44.009 --> 18:45.643
Guys break the rules all the time.

18:45.677 --> 18:47.311
But for some reason, nobody likes it

18:47.346 --> 18:48.579
when the girls break the rules.

18:48.614 --> 18:50.147
Yeah, because if you break the rules,

18:50.182 --> 18:51.715
you might not want to have sex with us.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.984
Exactly. You might actually
have to fall in love

18:54.019 --> 18:56.354
and make a commitment to get
a girl to have sex with you.

18:56.388 --> 19:00.558
So until then, I'm saying "just say me."

19:02.694 --> 19:03.995
Just say me.

19:04.029 --> 19:07.665
[girls chant] Just say me. Just say me.

19:07.700 --> 19:10.334
Just say me. Just say me.

19:10.369 --> 19:13.672
Just say me. Just say me.

19:13.706 --> 19:16.341
Just say me. Just say me.

19:16.375 --> 19:19.044
Just say me. Just say me.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.588
Basically, I was ahead of my time.

19:25.622 --> 19:28.257
I just failed to come
up with the slogan.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.260
Would you take that stuff off?
It's embarrassing.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.261
What's embarrassing about it?

19:31.295 --> 19:32.262
We're going out together.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.265
We're having sex. Great sex.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.267
That doesn't stop me. Does it stop you?

19:36.301 --> 19:37.768
Okay, well, I don't advertise it.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.603
Come on, just take the stickers off.

19:39.638 --> 19:40.771
No.

19:40.806 --> 19:42.273
Alice, either take those
stickers off, or--

19:42.307 --> 19:43.607
Or what?

19:43.642 --> 19:45.309
Or I'm never having sex with you again.

19:48.313 --> 19:50.480
You made your choice. Now live with it.

19:53.651 --> 19:54.618
Wait, wait.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.119
Her mother told her to do it.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.621
Her mother?

19:57.655 --> 19:59.289
Yup. Jack told me.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.958
My mother told me about it.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.626
Not about Grace's mother telling her,

20:02.661 --> 20:04.628
but about "just say me."

20:04.663 --> 20:06.965
My mother never said anything about it.

20:06.999 --> 20:09.968
And just because I got pregnant
having sex with a guy doesn't mean

20:10.002 --> 20:12.638
I now have to restrict myself to "
just say me."

20:12.672 --> 20:14.974
I don't know if I even
want to have sex with me.

20:15.008 --> 20:16.977
Why should you? No one else does.

20:17.011 --> 20:18.145
Funny.

20:18.179 --> 20:19.312
Mom never talked to you

20:19.347 --> 20:20.647
about anything like that,

20:20.681 --> 20:21.982
about "just say me," has she?

20:22.016 --> 20:24.651
You've seen her boyfriend. David, right?

20:24.685 --> 20:26.987
I don't think she knows
anything about it.

20:27.021 --> 20:29.323
Grace's mom is the one
who told her about it.

20:29.357 --> 20:31.725
She's the one who came up with
the whole "just say me" idea.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.327
I'm not surprised.

20:33.361 --> 20:36.997
Don't forget, Grace's mom
was married to our dad.

20:37.031 --> 20:39.000
I have to go. Got to go by the band room

20:39.034 --> 20:40.668
and get to the church nursery.

20:40.702 --> 20:43.004
See you.

20:43.038 --> 20:45.673
Hey, girlfriend. What are we doing?

20:45.707 --> 20:48.009
I'm going to work. What are you doing?

20:48.043 --> 20:51.012
I'll just be hanging out,
waiting for you to get home.

20:51.046 --> 20:52.180
You don't have to do that.

20:52.214 --> 20:53.681
By the time I get home from work,

20:53.715 --> 20:55.016
Ricky will probably be
home from work, too,

20:55.050 --> 20:58.019
and I know how much
you like seeing Ricky,

20:58.054 --> 20:59.688
so I'll take care of
John by myself tonight,

20:59.722 --> 21:01.289
and Ricky can go straight
over to your house.

21:01.324 --> 21:02.691
No, he's not coming over.

21:02.725 --> 21:05.694
I'm totally supporting that
"just say me" campaign,

21:05.728 --> 21:08.364
so he's not going to be
interested in coming over.

21:08.398 --> 21:12.035
Well, if you're going to be
supporting the "just say me" campaign,

21:12.069 --> 21:14.370
and I'm going to be supporting
the "just say me" campaign,

21:14.405 --> 21:17.040
I guess we won't have time for
you to come over and hang out.

21:18.176 --> 21:20.044
Oh, we have time.

21:20.078 --> 21:21.712
Adrian, it's okay. Really.

21:21.746 --> 21:23.380
You don't have to be my friend.

21:23.415 --> 21:26.551
We don't have to be friends.
And even if we were friends,

21:26.585 --> 21:28.719
I don't think I'd be comfortable
with you around John.

21:28.754 --> 21:30.388
At least, not any time soon.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.223
I haven't even let my two best friends

21:32.258 --> 21:34.726
that I've known since the
third grade baby-sit him.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.062
I almost did, once or twice,

21:37.096 --> 21:39.731
but it's hard to trust
anyone other than Ricky.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.399
I get it, sister. I do.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.401
But you trust Ricky with him,

21:43.436 --> 21:47.739
so maybe soon you'll trust
Ricky and me with him,

21:47.774 --> 21:49.074
once you get to know me better.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.076
Regardless of how well I know you,

21:51.110 --> 21:53.078
I would be jealous of
you and Ricky with him.

21:53.113 --> 21:56.081
He's my son. I don't want
another woman in my son's life.

21:56.116 --> 21:58.417
What about Ricky?

21:58.451 --> 22:00.752
You mind another woman in Ricky's life?

22:00.787 --> 22:02.421
I'm his girlfriend.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.757
The father of your baby's girlfriend.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.425
Adrian, we need to talk.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.427
I have to go.

22:08.461 --> 22:11.096
If you're my girlfriend,
then you're sleeping with me.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.430
Don't try that approach.
I don't like it.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.932
We've been having sex for over a year.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.601
You can't have sex one day and
then not have it the next day,

22:16.635 --> 22:19.204
and then change your mind and
then want it again and then not.

22:19.238 --> 22:21.406
Yes, I can. Adrian. Ricky.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.442
Come on, you're not
like those other girls.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.077
Yes, I am. No, you're not.

22:25.112 --> 22:26.379
Well, maybe I want to be.

22:26.413 --> 22:28.114
Why? Why would you want to be like them?

22:28.148 --> 22:29.749
You love having sex with guys, with me.

22:29.784 --> 22:31.451
You don't need "just say me."

22:31.486 --> 22:34.121
It's not a matter of need, is it?

22:34.156 --> 22:37.692
Maybe if I had girlfriends,
real girlfriends,

22:37.726 --> 22:39.627
I would have never slept
with you in the first place.

22:39.661 --> 22:41.129
And maybe if I hadn't slept with you,

22:41.163 --> 22:43.465
I would know if you
really loved me or not.

22:43.499 --> 22:45.467
And if you really love me,
then I wouldn't care

22:45.501 --> 22:47.836
if you spent all the time in
the world with Amy and John,

22:47.871 --> 22:49.805
because they wouldn't be a threat to me.

22:49.839 --> 22:52.808
But as it is, I have to
prostitute myself out to Amy,

22:52.842 --> 22:54.476
just so I can please everyone.

22:54.511 --> 22:56.478
I don't like pleasing everyone.

22:56.512 --> 22:57.680
I like pleasing me.

22:59.516 --> 23:01.017
I like pleasing you, too.

23:05.189 --> 23:06.489
Come on, Adrian.

23:12.363 --> 23:13.496
Oh, hey, let me grab that.

23:13.531 --> 23:15.098
Uh, thanks, but I got it.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.466
Okay.

23:17.868 --> 23:21.170
Oh. You even got the sticker.

23:21.205 --> 23:22.872
Someone else put them there. I didn't.

23:22.907 --> 23:24.507
Well, just so you know,

23:24.542 --> 23:26.176
I support that 1,000%,

23:26.210 --> 23:28.378
your not having sex with guys.

23:28.412 --> 23:30.480
Do you? Why is that?

23:30.514 --> 23:33.181
Because...

23:33.216 --> 23:34.783
Because it would kill me if you did.

23:34.818 --> 23:36.652
Because...

23:36.686 --> 23:39.188
Because even though
we're just friends now,

23:39.222 --> 23:41.523
I still wouldn't want you to
have sex with any other guy.

23:41.558 --> 23:43.593
What a friendly thing to say.

23:43.627 --> 23:46.029
But not every guy in high
school wants to have sex

23:46.064 --> 23:48.199
and insists on having
sex with his girlfriend.

23:48.233 --> 23:49.633
Oh, yeah? Name one.

23:49.668 --> 23:51.703
I don't know one,
but I'm going to find one.

23:51.737 --> 23:53.271
In the meantime, it's just say me.

23:53.305 --> 23:55.974
In the meantime?
When you find that one--

23:56.009 --> 23:58.043
When you find that elusive guy
who doesn't want to have sex,

23:58.078 --> 24:00.045
you're going to be saying,
"Just say me," every night.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.046
I know.

24:01.081 --> 24:03.049
I've been there.

24:05.552 --> 24:07.486
Shy. Oh, hi, Jack.

24:07.521 --> 24:09.021
"Just say me." You too?

24:09.056 --> 24:10.523
Are you serious? Of course.

24:10.557 --> 24:12.024
I think every woman
should focus on herself.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.793
You know, that's how I
got to where I am today.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.227
You know what that means,
right? Just say me?

24:15.261 --> 24:16.962
I don't know what it
means to other girls,

24:16.996 --> 24:19.498
but to me it means not putting
anyone's dreams ahead of your own,

24:19.532 --> 24:21.032
not giving into drugs or alcohol,

24:21.067 --> 24:22.167
respecting yourself.

24:22.201 --> 24:25.370
All righty. Well, have a good evening.

24:25.404 --> 24:27.738
Nice going. I think he bought it.

24:27.773 --> 24:30.040
Guys are such idiots. I know.

24:43.855 --> 24:44.955
Hi, Mom.

24:44.990 --> 24:46.858
Hi.

24:46.892 --> 24:49.995
There you are.

24:50.029 --> 24:51.129
Sit down.

24:51.164 --> 24:52.631
Am I in trouble?

24:52.665 --> 24:53.665
Oh, yeah.

24:57.036 --> 24:59.137
Just say me?

24:59.172 --> 25:02.374
Is that about what I said?

25:13.216 --> 25:15.217
Am I wrong?

25:15.252 --> 25:16.518
That's neither here nor there?

25:16.553 --> 25:18.754
This isn't about what's right or wrong.

25:18.789 --> 25:20.256
This is about what's
appropriate in high school.

25:20.290 --> 25:21.957
Oh, come on.

25:21.991 --> 25:23.692
You said you like to dance.

25:23.726 --> 25:25.527
You can't like to dance
and not like to--

25:25.561 --> 25:26.729
Okay, Grace.

25:26.763 --> 25:28.878
Please. I mean, just because
a person likes to dance,

25:28.913 --> 25:30.546
doesn't mean anything.

25:30.580 --> 25:32.046
I mean, just that a
person likes to dance.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.214
Well, she's that person.

25:33.248 --> 25:36.417
I do like to dance,
as well as do other things.

25:36.452 --> 25:39.120
However, this has gotten out of hand.

25:39.154 --> 25:40.254
Bad choice of words.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.089
Well, what do you want us to do?

25:42.124 --> 25:44.659
I mean, do you want me to call all
the other parents and apologize?

25:44.693 --> 25:46.894
You're going to call the
parents of 2,000 students

25:46.929 --> 25:49.697
and apologize for suggesting
that they just say me.

25:49.731 --> 25:51.966
There's nothing to apologize for.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.634
This is a good thing.

25:53.669 --> 25:56.437
I mean, I didn't know it was going
to get around school like this,

25:56.472 --> 25:58.481
but when it did--

25:58.516 --> 26:00.050
You didn't know?

26:00.084 --> 26:03.220
Grace, did you put the stickers and
bumper stickers and magnets everywhere?

26:03.254 --> 26:04.588
No, Joe did.

26:04.622 --> 26:06.590
He's selling them.

26:06.624 --> 26:08.725
Yeah, do you know how
much money he's making?

26:08.760 --> 26:10.827
A guy making money off
my slogan, your idea.

26:10.862 --> 26:14.931
Grace, I didn't mean for you to
share this with the entire school.

26:14.966 --> 26:16.566
Does the entire school know that I--

26:16.601 --> 26:17.968
Do it?

26:18.002 --> 26:20.704
No, that I talk to my
daughter about this?

26:20.738 --> 26:22.005
Yes.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.807
Well, I'm going to get
kicked out of church.

26:23.841 --> 26:25.242
I got kicked out of TAG.

26:25.276 --> 26:26.510
Yeah, but not for this.

26:26.544 --> 26:28.078
Yeah, can you believe it?

26:28.112 --> 26:29.179
TAG?

26:29.213 --> 26:31.248
Teen Abstinence Group at church.

26:31.282 --> 26:33.350
Is it abstinence if you just say me?

26:33.384 --> 26:36.186
We don't know.
We don't make up the rules.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.889
Yeah, we don't even follow the rules.

26:38.923 --> 26:40.390
But we're not the only
Christians who don't.

26:40.425 --> 26:43.894
The point is, we try to do good things,

26:43.928 --> 26:45.362
and this is a good thing.

26:45.396 --> 26:49.566
Yeah, well, trying to do good
things doesn't always work.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.436
I was trying to do a good thing
by taking a student to the prom.

26:52.470 --> 26:54.905
He was getting teased
mercilessly all year

26:54.939 --> 26:56.740
for never having had a
date in high school.

26:56.774 --> 26:58.909
The kids were calling him "the eunuch."

26:58.943 --> 27:01.244
I hated those kids and
I hated that school,

27:01.279 --> 27:02.979
so when he asked me, I accepted.

27:03.014 --> 27:04.981
And that's what got me here today.

27:05.016 --> 27:07.751
And trying to do good has the
two of you joining me here.

27:07.785 --> 27:12.589
So you're going to have to remove all
the stickers, et cetera, from the
hallway.

27:12.623 --> 27:14.991
Or I can suspend you, Grace.

27:15.026 --> 27:18.651
Although I doubt either of you would
mind spending more time at home, alone.

27:22.639 --> 27:23.639
There you go.

27:35.819 --> 27:36.852
High school.

27:39.489 --> 27:42.325
What's going on? The ladies
are removing all the stickers.

27:42.359 --> 27:44.794
That's right. We can't have
a "just say me" campaign.

27:44.828 --> 27:46.329
It's inappropriate.

27:46.363 --> 27:51.167
I get it. It's bigger than high school,
much, much bigger.

27:57.374 --> 28:00.810
I heard the plan is that no one's
supposed to be with a guy for a week.

28:00.844 --> 28:02.144
Yeah, well, I don't have a guy.

28:02.179 --> 28:04.480
I don't have a guy, either.

28:04.514 --> 28:06.482
Lots of girls don't have guys.

28:06.516 --> 28:08.984
And if you ask me, we spend way
too much time thinking about guys.

28:09.019 --> 28:11.987
Yeah, maybe, but I would
like to have a guy.

28:12.022 --> 28:14.490
Okay, well, with or without a guy,

28:14.524 --> 28:15.791
I guess "just say me" is valid.

28:15.826 --> 28:20.496
I'd be too embarrassed to "just say me."

28:20.530 --> 28:22.331
You would have me film you giving birth,

28:22.366 --> 28:24.333
but you wouldn't "just
say me" when you're alone

28:24.368 --> 28:27.503
and no one's around and no one would
ever know? I don't believe you.

28:27.537 --> 28:29.505
Okay.

28:29.539 --> 28:33.476
Maybe I have. Then again, maybe I
haven't. It's a very personal decision.

28:33.510 --> 28:37.369
Ah, it's a decision? You're happy,
you laugh, you're sad, you cry.

28:37.373 --> 28:39.205
You feel like "just say me,
" it's not a decision.

28:39.689 --> 28:41.056
I don't do anything
without thinking about it.

28:41.090 --> 28:42.524
Really? Have you met your son?

28:48.531 --> 28:50.699
Hi. [both] Hey, Dad.

28:53.236 --> 28:55.704
I think this is the first time
I've come in on a conversation

28:55.738 --> 28:56.972
between you two,
and you stopped talking.

28:57.006 --> 28:59.875
Don't say anything.

28:59.909 --> 29:01.510
I don't know what you're talking about,

29:01.544 --> 29:03.212
but whatever it is,
whatever secret you're sharing,

29:03.246 --> 29:05.881
I'm just so happy that the two
of you are acting like sisters--

29:05.915 --> 29:08.217
Sisters sharing secrets, being sisters.

29:08.251 --> 29:10.886
It's a milestone in your sistership.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.154
Wish I had a camera.

29:12.188 --> 29:13.989
This is great.

29:14.023 --> 29:18.527
I'll just go to my room
and stay there, alone.

29:21.931 --> 29:22.898
Me, too.

29:26.936 --> 29:29.071
Maybe I will, too.

29:30.740 --> 29:32.841
Anne? Hi, how are you?

29:32.876 --> 29:34.910
I'm great. Look, I know you
don't want to talk to me,

29:34.944 --> 29:37.346
and I'm probably keeping you
from your boyfriend up there--

29:37.380 --> 29:39.982
If you are seeing someone. And I hope
not, because I love you and want you
back.

29:40.016 --> 29:42.551
<i>I just came in on the girls. They were
sitting in the kitchen, talking.</i>

29:42.585 --> 29:45.921
And just as I came in, they got
completely quiet, the two of them.

29:45.955 --> 29:48.590
They've got some secret they're
talking about. Isn't that great?

29:48.625 --> 29:50.158
Do you know what they're talking about?

29:50.193 --> 29:52.016
No. You know what they're talking about?

29:52.551 --> 29:54.418
Yes. Amy called me.

29:54.453 --> 29:55.419
<i>And?</i>

29:55.454 --> 29:56.520
They're talking about masturbation.

29:58.790 --> 30:01.759
Oh, jeez, why did you tell me that?

30:01.793 --> 30:03.961
I don't know. Because it's the truth?

30:03.995 --> 30:06.096
I don't care about the truth.

30:06.131 --> 30:08.432
Jeez, I'm going to have
to live in my room.

30:08.467 --> 30:10.434
I'll never be able to look
them in the face again.

30:10.469 --> 30:11.502
Why were they talking about that?

30:11.536 --> 30:13.771
Well, it seems that your ex-wife--

30:13.805 --> 30:15.773
Who's dating a younger man, by the way--

30:15.807 --> 30:17.775
Suggested it to Grace as something to do

30:17.809 --> 30:19.009
instead of having sex.

30:19.044 --> 30:20.778
<i>What? Yup.</i>

30:20.812 --> 30:22.379
That woman's crazy. She doesn't do that.

30:22.414 --> 30:23.547
All women do it.

30:23.582 --> 30:24.949
No, they don't. Maybe if she had,

30:24.983 --> 30:26.450
she wouldn't have cheated on me.

30:26.485 --> 30:27.985
That could have stopped that.

30:28.019 --> 30:29.887
I doubt it. Women do it

30:29.921 --> 30:32.656
<i>for the same reason that men do it-
Because they want to.</i>

30:32.691 --> 30:35.292
And I think I'm going to talk
to Amy and Ashley about it,

30:35.327 --> 30:38.462
because I think it's fine if they
want to do that until they're older,

30:38.497 --> 30:40.197
until they get in the
right relationship,

30:40.232 --> 30:41.932
<i>or it's the right time.</i>

30:41.967 --> 30:45.402
Until then, or even after then,
I think it's perfectly okay.

30:45.437 --> 30:47.471
Isn't this nice?

30:47.506 --> 30:50.307
Just having a conversation about
masturbation like we're two normal
people.

30:50.342 --> 30:51.709
It is nice.

30:54.179 --> 30:55.479
How's Mimsy?

30:55.514 --> 30:57.281
<i>She's not doing well, George.</i>

30:57.315 --> 30:58.482
Her memory's fading fast.

30:58.517 --> 30:59.917
<i>Oh.</i>

30:59.951 --> 31:02.119
That's too bad, Anne.
I'm sorry. I love Mimsy.

31:02.153 --> 31:04.488
Yeah. I do, too.

31:04.523 --> 31:07.391
She thinks that Robbie is Amy
or Ashley when they were babies,

31:07.425 --> 31:10.160
and it takes me back to the
years when we were first married

31:10.195 --> 31:12.252
and she came and helped
out with the girls.

31:12.287 --> 31:16.423
<i>But even if she doesn't know who Robbie
is sometimes, and even me sometimes,</i>

31:16.458 --> 31:19.693
it's still nice to see my mom with him.

31:19.727 --> 31:23.163
He's never going to know her.
At least, not how she was.

31:23.198 --> 31:26.366
Look, Anne, I'm not going
to beg you to come home.

31:26.401 --> 31:27.634
I've done that enough already.

31:27.669 --> 31:29.136
And you know how badly I
feel about everything.

31:29.170 --> 31:31.171
If I thought you were up there
just for your old boyfriend,

31:31.206 --> 31:32.773
I'd come up and do something stupid

31:32.807 --> 31:35.142
<i>like punch him in the nose. But I don't
know what to do,</i>

31:35.176 --> 31:37.744
since it's about your mother
and you and me and our family

31:37.779 --> 31:39.046
<i>and life in general.</i>

31:39.080 --> 31:40.414
It's about all that,

31:40.448 --> 31:42.382
<i>and more.</i>

31:42.417 --> 31:43.484
Good night, Anne.

31:43.518 --> 31:45.385
Good night, George.

31:45.420 --> 31:47.054
<i>Oh, hey George. Yeah?</i>

31:47.088 --> 31:48.355
What are you wearing?

31:51.092 --> 31:52.326
Nothing.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.394
Good night, George.

31:54.429 --> 31:55.729
Good night, Anne.

34:04.438 --> 34:05.772
What?

34:12.078 --> 34:13.178
Amy?

34:13.212 --> 34:14.478
Hey, Adrian.

34:14.514 --> 34:15.547
You need a glass of water?

34:15.581 --> 34:16.715
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

34:16.748 --> 34:18.049
<i>Okay.</i>

34:22.588 --> 34:24.889
Ms. Adrian is coming over.

34:24.924 --> 34:28.560
Adrian bought the house next
door so she could spy on Daddy.

34:28.594 --> 34:32.563
Yeah, Adrian loves your daddy.

34:32.598 --> 34:35.233
Your daddy loves her, so...

34:35.268 --> 34:37.803
Hi. Oh, I forgot the water.

34:37.837 --> 34:39.538
Oh, it's okay.

34:39.572 --> 34:42.206
You must be pretty bored to call me.

34:42.241 --> 34:44.409
It's just...

34:44.443 --> 34:46.244
Without having a boyfriend in my life,

34:46.279 --> 34:49.181
maybe I do have room for
a new friend after all.

34:49.215 --> 34:50.748
Really?

34:50.783 --> 34:52.417
Really.

34:52.451 --> 34:54.585
I guess we could try
to be friends anyway,

34:54.620 --> 34:57.589
for him. For John.

35:01.627 --> 35:02.929
Do you remember Adrian?

35:02.963 --> 35:04.121
You remember?

35:06.355 --> 35:07.422
You want to hold him?

35:10.192 --> 35:12.327
Hi, John.

35:12.361 --> 35:15.630
Hi.

35:15.664 --> 35:19.600
Yeah? There's a butterfly there.

35:35.826 --> 35:37.261
It was like the hula-hoop.
It came and it went.

35:37.295 --> 35:39.463
I just want to thank
you for not doing that.

35:39.497 --> 35:40.631
What?

35:40.665 --> 35:42.800
For not going the way
of the other girls.

35:42.834 --> 35:44.802
I did go the way of the other girls.

35:44.836 --> 35:46.637
All last week? Yeah.

35:46.671 --> 35:49.807
I don't know how you have the time
or the energy. I dropped glee club.

35:49.841 --> 35:51.842
But you love to sing. Yeah.

35:54.179 --> 35:56.480
I wrote a book. An entire book?

35:56.514 --> 35:58.482
More like a novella.

35:58.516 --> 36:00.150
I'm afraid to ask what it's about.

36:00.185 --> 36:02.486
You know what they say-
Write what you know.

36:02.520 --> 36:03.821
Oh, no.

36:03.855 --> 36:05.489
I'm not going to try
and get it published.

36:05.523 --> 36:07.691
At least not before my dad dies.

36:07.726 --> 36:11.161
I went to my grandmother's house
yesterday to help her bake cookies.

36:11.196 --> 36:13.163
I told her about the
"just say me" campaign.

36:13.198 --> 36:14.498
You didn't. I did.

36:14.532 --> 36:16.166
She thought it was pretty funny,

36:16.201 --> 36:18.524
and she's dating a guy and
she's older than his mother.

36:18.559 --> 36:20.193
Wow, you've got good genes,

36:20.227 --> 36:22.862
and you've got till you're
89 to find a boyfriend.

36:22.896 --> 36:25.198
Hey, Lauren.

36:25.232 --> 36:28.201
Hey, yourself.

36:28.235 --> 36:29.535
Thanks for calling me.

36:29.570 --> 36:31.537
I didn't call you.

36:31.572 --> 36:33.873
Yeah, but I was hoping you would.

36:33.907 --> 36:37.376
I was wondering if you'd
like to go out this weekend.

36:37.411 --> 36:38.478
Talk to you later.

36:42.316 --> 36:44.150
Whoa. Whoa. Didn't see you there.

36:44.184 --> 36:46.018
Maybe you went blind last week.

36:46.053 --> 36:49.655
Oh, come on. "Just say
me" can't make you blind.

36:49.690 --> 36:51.891
There are virtually no bad
side effects physically--

36:51.925 --> 36:52.959
That I can think of.

36:52.993 --> 36:54.227
Yeah, there are.

36:54.261 --> 36:56.429
I don't think any guy was
hooking up last week.

36:56.463 --> 36:59.699
No, that would be the
unavoidable collateral damage.

36:59.733 --> 37:03.569
Wait, that would make a good title
for my book. I wrote a book.

37:03.604 --> 37:05.972
Why? I don't know. I'm a writer.

37:06.006 --> 37:07.940
Still, wouldn't you rather
be doing something fun?

37:07.975 --> 37:10.209
Like going out with you and having sex?

37:11.411 --> 37:12.411
How's it going?

37:12.446 --> 37:13.646
We decided we'd go out.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.147
As long as we're still broken up.

37:15.182 --> 37:17.583
We're still broken up, right?

37:17.618 --> 37:19.118
Yeah, we're still broken up.

37:20.153 --> 37:21.254
So where you going to go?

37:21.288 --> 37:24.991
I don't know. Do you
know a guy named Colby?

37:25.025 --> 37:26.259
My dad did him a favor,

37:26.293 --> 37:28.761
and he gave him two floor seats

37:28.795 --> 37:30.263
for whatever sport he plays.

37:30.297 --> 37:32.965
My stepmom didn't want to go,
so he said I could have them.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.934
If you're talking about Kobe Bryant,

37:34.968 --> 37:37.359
and those are floor
seats to a Lakers game,

37:38.004 --> 37:39.471
I will marry you.

37:40.573 --> 37:43.041
Yeah, um, let's see how it goes.

37:48.081 --> 37:50.582
I doubt it's Kobe.
I doubt I'll marry her.

37:50.616 --> 37:52.551
Maybe you will.

37:52.585 --> 37:55.220
I mean, it's rare you marry the
first girl you have sex with.

37:55.254 --> 37:57.389
Oh, that's right.

37:57.423 --> 37:59.391
I wasn't your first. You were my first.

38:02.095 --> 38:03.495
I'll never forget it.

38:04.897 --> 38:05.897
Enjoy the game, Jack.

38:11.904 --> 38:13.839
You're not really her friend.

38:13.873 --> 38:17.075
Yeah. I am really her friend.
She let me hold John.

38:17.110 --> 38:19.077
So what? You're not her friend.

38:19.112 --> 38:20.612
You're just pretending to be her friend.

38:20.646 --> 38:25.350
I told you, if you pretend
something long enough, it happens.

38:25.384 --> 38:28.453
For example, you've been pretending
to love me for over a year,

38:28.488 --> 38:29.955
so you might actually love me.

38:29.989 --> 38:31.756
I told you I love you.

38:31.791 --> 38:36.695
Yeah, but you tell me because you
want to keep having sex with me.

38:36.729 --> 38:38.997
But now I think maybe you do love me.

38:39.031 --> 38:40.765
Not because you're friends with Amy.

38:40.800 --> 38:43.735
No. Because you love me.

38:45.738 --> 38:48.440
So I guess the "just say
me" fad's over, huh?

38:48.474 --> 38:50.442
For some people.

38:50.476 --> 38:53.445
You need a boyfriend.
We have to get you a boyfriend.

38:53.479 --> 38:55.203
I don't need a boyfriend.
I have a friend.

38:55.727 --> 38:57.028
Don't you want a boyfriend?

38:57.062 --> 38:58.696
What for?

38:58.730 --> 39:00.031
What for?

39:00.065 --> 39:01.365
Look around. Everyone in high school

39:01.400 --> 39:02.700
is miserable for a reason.

39:02.734 --> 39:04.368
They all want boyfriends or girlfriends.

39:04.403 --> 39:05.536
I do not want anything.

39:05.571 --> 39:07.205
Oh, come on.

39:07.239 --> 39:09.040
You're not that cool.

39:09.074 --> 39:10.908
Yeah? Take another look.

39:15.814 --> 39:18.316
All right, you are, you are.

39:25.757 --> 39:29.060
So you and Adrian-- You're friends?

39:29.094 --> 39:30.728
That's what I heard, anyway.

39:30.762 --> 39:32.129
Yeah, I guess.

39:32.164 --> 39:35.233
I don't know, but who knows?

39:35.267 --> 39:38.402
Maybe one day, I'll meet a guy that
I like as much as you liked Maria,

39:38.437 --> 39:40.805
and I'll want to leave John
for a few hours and go out.

39:40.839 --> 39:42.740
Yeah.

39:44.276 --> 39:45.409
Hi, Ben.

39:45.444 --> 39:48.079
Hi. Donna.

39:48.113 --> 39:49.447
Sorry to interrupt.

39:49.481 --> 39:50.848
It's okay.

39:50.883 --> 39:52.750
I heard you know some Italian.

39:52.784 --> 39:54.418
I need some help in my Italian class.

39:54.453 --> 39:56.020
I was hoping you could help me.

39:56.054 --> 39:59.156
Ben is very good with Italians.

39:59.191 --> 40:01.125
I mean, Italian.

40:01.159 --> 40:04.095
Go ahead, Ben. It's good talking to you.

40:04.129 --> 40:06.664
Same here. Tell John hello for me.

40:06.698 --> 40:07.932
Mm-hmm.

40:15.029 --> 40:16.897
[Boy] Pimento?

40:16.931 --> 40:18.565
What are you doing here?

40:18.599 --> 40:20.167
That campaign, it made the news.

40:20.201 --> 40:21.334
I figured you go to school here.

40:21.369 --> 40:23.003
You might be happy to see me.

40:23.037 --> 40:25.071
I am happy to see you.

40:25.106 --> 40:28.508
But I have work.

40:28.543 --> 40:30.677
I work at the church nursery,

40:30.711 --> 40:32.679
and they're expecting me there.

40:32.713 --> 40:34.181
So is my son.

40:34.215 --> 40:35.982
Yeah, yeah, I know. Your mom told me.

40:36.017 --> 40:39.085
But I figured I could
meet you afterwards

40:39.120 --> 40:41.221
and grab a pizza with you and John.

40:41.255 --> 40:44.357
Okay. Yeah.

40:44.392 --> 40:46.193
Or I could take John home after work,

40:46.227 --> 40:49.462
and my next-door neighbor and
friend Adrian could watch him.

40:49.497 --> 40:51.231
And then we could go out, the two of us.

40:51.265 --> 40:53.033
That sounds good. Yeah.

40:53.067 --> 40:54.701
Let's go.
