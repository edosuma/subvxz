I can do better than that.

on a person of interest

fencing merchandise

his dmv photo there.

to having great relationships

12:37.624 --> 12:39.390
with pawnshops in Denver,

12:39.392 --> 12:40.859
Mr. Norton is also employed

12:40.861 --> 12:43.495

company here in L.A.

in Hollywood.

carefully beforehand.

12:49.736 --> 12:53.171
But instead
of arresting Mr. Norton,

12:53.173 --> 12:56.141
you put an undercover detail
on him. Is that it?

12:56.143 --> 12:58.877
Since our home invaders
had never shot anyone before,

12:58.879 --> 13:00.812

Mr. Norton?

to the rest of his gang.

a chance, captain,

no personnel changes
to your division.

that julio has served out

13:18.932 --> 13:21.966

without pay,

he has a grip on his temper.

with him have been fine.
I know, I know.

And I'd like julio Sanchez

the next two weeks.

failed so badly.

was here this morning.

to arrest him.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.747
Maybe Norton's
the wrong guy.

14:09.749 --> 14:13.151
Or maybe he figured out
that you were following,

in the opposite direction.

in the robbery?

or stopping by his residence.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.643
And he's not communicating
with them

14:38.645 --> 14:41.246
through cellphone
or e-mail accounts.
Provenza: Yeah, yeah.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.949
But your report says here
that you observed Norton

14:44.951 --> 14:47.685

with computers, iPads...

14:47.687 --> 14:50.989
When you have suspects
under surveillance and
they commit a crime,

14:50.991 --> 14:52.924
you're required by law
to arrest them.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.592
Loading up a van
is not a crime.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.461

have known that stuff was stolen

14:56.463 --> 14:58.696
without breaking cover
and taking it, sir?

14:58.698 --> 15:02.233
He walked right up
to the line.
Yeah, but he didn't cross it.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.535
And if Norton
is casing another house,

15:04.537 --> 15:06.271
why shouldn't Cooper
set up there

in the act?

Absolutely not.
