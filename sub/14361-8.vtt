<i>(Frankie) Thanksgiving--</i>
<i>that time of year</i>

00:06.319 --> 00:08.016
<i>when the whole country</i>
<i>scurries about</i>

00:08.162 --> 00:10.954
<i>hunting and gathering</i>
<i>for the holiday feast.</i>

00:12.138 --> 00:13.478
(Clatters)

00:14.916 --> 00:16.102
What are you doing?

00:16.403 --> 00:18.867
Frugal Hoosier started
charging 10 cents for bags,

00:19.015 --> 00:20.393
so I told them
to find another sucker,

00:20.528 --> 00:21.866
and I beat 'em
at their own game.

00:21.983 --> 00:23.258
Oh. Listen to this.

00:23.393 --> 00:25.848
I saw this flier that says
you can sign up

00:25.980 --> 00:28.176
to host two Marines
at your Thanksgiving dinner.

00:28.306 --> 00:29.556
How cool would that be?

00:29.704 --> 00:32.048
Well, it depends on whose house
they're going to.

00:32.255 --> 00:33.839
Come on. It's the Marines.

00:33.964 --> 00:35.375
We don't do anything
for this country.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.909
All we have is that "support
our troops" bumper sticker,

00:38.038 --> 00:40.009
and Axl turned it
into "support our poops."

00:40.112 --> 00:42.141
Plus Nancy Donahue
doesn't have any.

00:42.249 --> 00:43.776
We'd be the only ones
on the block.

00:43.889 --> 00:44.812
You really want to invite

00:44.929 --> 00:46.488
outside observers
into this place?

00:46.694 --> 00:48.828
I actually think it would
be nice to have guests.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.649
- We've already got your parents coming.
- They're not guests.

00:51.764 --> 00:55.179
- Sure feel like guests when they kick
me out of my bed. - (Sighs) Mike....

00:55.312 --> 00:57.808
Don't say my name and think you
can make me do stuff.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.722
Well, I was hoping
you'd have a different reaction,

00:59.901 --> 01:01.826
'cause I already signed us up.

01:01.932 --> 01:03.552
(Scoffs)
What? Why'd you even ask?

01:03.663 --> 01:05.093
Because I had to act quick.

01:05.206 --> 01:07.317
I was afraid they were gonna
run out of Marines.

01:07.440 --> 01:08.867
There aren't that many
of them, you know.

01:08.998 --> 01:10.547
It's right there
in the motto--

01:10.671 --> 01:12.126
"The few, the proud."

01:12.818 --> 01:15.505
I gotta say, I thought you'd be
more patriotic about this.

01:15.612 --> 01:17.882
I am being patriotic. These
people fight for our country.

01:18.110 --> 01:19.283
Haven't they
been through enough?

01:19.452 --> 01:21.478
Oh, crap. I think I left
the frozen food on the porch.

01:21.587 --> 01:22.781
Brick!

01:23.827 --> 01:25.612
(Door closes)
This book is life-changing.

01:25.775 --> 01:27.318
Mom dropped me at the library

01:27.428 --> 01:28.796
to find
the perfect holiday read,

01:28.915 --> 01:30.790
and out of nowhere,
it just appeared to me.

01:34.453 --> 01:36.242
"The real true
behind-the-scenes story

01:36.364 --> 01:40.919
of the making of Erich Segal's
1970's classic, Love Story."

01:41.114 --> 01:43.007
Really? All the books
they got in the library,

01:43.182 --> 01:44.260
and that's the one you picked?

01:44.550 --> 01:46.457
Have you read it?
It's fascinating.

01:46.651 --> 01:48.857
How did I go so long
without finding this?

01:48.957 --> 01:50.561
It's a Thanksgiving gift,
I tell you.

01:50.673 --> 01:51.868
A gift.

01:53.725 --> 01:55.281
You know, the only thing
that would have made that better

01:55.386 --> 01:57.330
is if strangers
were here to see it.

01:58.213 --> 01:59.575
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Brick wasn't the only one</i>

01:59.665 --> 02:01.743
<i>with a fascination</i>
<i>for the library.</i>

02:01.893 --> 02:02.904
<i>Over the past few weeks,</i>

02:03.003 --> 02:06.043
<i>Axl had become very focused</i>
<i>on his studies.</i>

02:06.110 --> 02:08.578
So the biggest thing you need
to study for your test is...

02:09.155 --> 02:11.037
"The legislative branch."

02:12.093 --> 02:13.019
Wow.

02:13.116 --> 02:14.219
Your handwriting's pretty...

02:14.316 --> 02:15.865
Terrible.
Uh, but I can say that

02:15.970 --> 02:17.542
'cause my handwriting
is awesome.

02:17.724 --> 02:19.471
Maybe I need
a handwriting tutor.

02:20.041 --> 02:22.340
Maybe you do. (Chuckles)

02:23.305 --> 02:23.826
(Scribbling)

02:23.949 --> 02:25.038
"Axl...

02:25.135 --> 02:26.187
is...

02:27.021 --> 02:28.414
brilliant."

02:29.515 --> 02:30.697
Pretty impressive, huh?

02:30.799 --> 02:32.465
Uh-huh. It'd be
even more impressive

02:32.573 --> 02:34.815
if you spelled "brilliant"
with two L's.

02:35.324 --> 02:36.332
(Both laugh)

02:36.440 --> 02:38.107
(Cell phone ringing)

02:38.208 --> 02:41.185
Oh, it's my boyfriend
calling from Northwestern.

02:41.336 --> 02:42.619
I should take this.

02:42.816 --> 02:44.725
Cool. Cool. Cool.

02:44.826 --> 02:46.903
Yeah, I gotta get
to the foot doctor anyway.

02:47.336 --> 02:50.141
(Clears throat) You know.
I'll see you later,

02:50.250 --> 02:52.696
and just don't worry
about, uh, anything.

02:53.989 --> 02:55.044
Just... uh, good luck.

02:55.191 --> 02:55.835
(School bell rings)

02:55.945 --> 02:58.404
Okay, no unauthorized
non-mascots are allowed in here,

02:58.548 --> 03:01.583
so tell nobody
what you are about to see.

03:02.936 --> 03:04.453
(Clank)

03:05.105 --> 03:06.046
(Doors creak)

03:06.842 --> 03:08.051
Where's the head?

03:08.175 --> 03:10.755
Brad, the head is gone!

03:11.717 --> 03:12.607
Gone!

03:12.804 --> 03:14.071
The crack in my foot is gone!

03:14.189 --> 03:15.378
The Ax Man's back in the game!

03:15.495 --> 03:17.477
Stomp on my foot!
Go ahead! I'm healed!

03:17.589 --> 03:18.975
I'm a medical miracle!

03:19.090 --> 03:20.121
Are you serious?

03:20.228 --> 03:21.378
Doctor says as long
as he's not in pain,

03:21.485 --> 03:22.379
he's good to go.

03:22.502 --> 03:23.884
Does that mean
he can play Friday?

03:23.994 --> 03:25.060
With the recruiters there?

03:25.201 --> 03:26.374
Yep. We might not
have to pay for college

03:26.488 --> 03:27.726
with our kidneys after all.

03:27.830 --> 03:30.445
(Squeals) Oh!
(Laughs)

03:30.550 --> 03:31.261
Oh, Mike!

03:31.362 --> 03:32.656
You know what?
I'm telling you, Mike,

03:32.755 --> 03:34.200
us opening our hearts
to the Marines

03:34.317 --> 03:35.717
is the reason
he got better so fast.

03:35.860 --> 03:37.343
You put good
out into the world,

03:37.455 --> 03:38.934
and good comes back to you.

03:39.147 --> 03:42.530
(Doorbell rings) (Grunts)

03:42.722 --> 03:45.134
(Sighs) We would have been here
two hours ago!

03:45.244 --> 03:47.288
But Vasco de Gama here decided

03:47.425 --> 03:50.085
to take one
of his legendary shortcuts.

03:50.225 --> 03:53.657
He got so lost,
we never got to stop at Costco!

03:53.774 --> 03:56.498
What, so you couldn't get
your giant pop and hot dog?

03:56.628 --> 03:58.845
Do you know how many carbs
are in one of them buns?

03:58.948 --> 03:59.907
You lose 4 pounds,

04:00.014 --> 04:02.055
and suddenly
you're Jack Lalanne!

04:04.371 --> 04:06.646
- Happy Thanksgiving!
- Happy Thanksgiving!

04:07.388 --> 04:08.546
<i>And come hell or high water,</i>

04:08.659 --> 04:10.405
<i>I was determined</i>
<i>it was gonna be.</i>

04:10.769 --> 04:13.614
<i>'Cause turns out we had a lot</i>
<i>to be grateful for this year.</i>

04:13.906 --> 04:16.202
<i>And Axl couldn't wait</i>
<i>to share the good news.</i>

04:16.661 --> 04:19.334
I'm cured!
The Ax Man has riseth!

04:19.451 --> 04:20.909
Or is it "risen-eth"?
Doesn't matter.

04:21.046 --> 04:22.279
'Cause my foot
healed three weeks early.

04:22.437 --> 04:25.854
(Thud) Stomp on my foot. Go ahead.
Honestly. I'm fine. (Laughs)

04:25.955 --> 04:28.009
Wow, that's great, Axl,
but I'm kind of busy here.

04:28.146 --> 04:29.736
Gene has a big test
on world War II tomorrow.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.010
Well, grab a pencil, Gene.
We won.

04:32.123 --> 04:33.647
And you know who else
is gonna win Friday night?

04:33.835 --> 04:35.603
Orson, when we kick
Roosevelt's butt!

04:35.713 --> 04:36.961
So you're actually
gonna play in the game?

04:37.084 --> 04:38.459
You really think
that's a good idea?

04:38.590 --> 04:41.525
Uh, it's not just <i>a game,</i>
it's the championship,

04:41.637 --> 04:42.455
which reminds me,

04:42.566 --> 04:44.147
I'm gonna have to start
leaving our sessions early

04:44.258 --> 04:45.432
for practice, but...

04:45.573 --> 04:46.802
Great. So you're gonna
skip studying

04:46.934 --> 04:48.865
so you can go bash your head
into other guys' heads.

04:49.001 --> 04:50.174
Sounds like a super solid plan.

04:50.281 --> 04:52.008
You know what? Why don't we
just skip it altogether?

04:52.185 --> 04:54.368
Wow. You know what you
<i>should</i> tutor people on?

04:54.492 --> 04:56.190
How to ruin
the world's greatest moment,

04:56.289 --> 04:57.685
'cause you are awesome at it.

04:57.803 --> 04:59.021
I don't know
what to tell you, Axl.

04:59.148 --> 04:59.907
Sorry this didn't happen

05:00.023 --> 05:01.345
the way you played it
all out in your head.

05:01.459 --> 05:02.237
Let me tell you something.

05:02.350 --> 05:05.458
This is not a normal response
to awesome news, okay?

05:06.266 --> 05:08.677
Guess what?! Playing in
the championship Friday!

05:08.790 --> 05:10.219
(Cheers and applause)

05:10.522 --> 05:12.111
That was a normal response.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:21.719 --> 05:23.487
I've checked everywhere,
and it's nowhere.

05:23.625 --> 05:25.189
Not the dry cleaners,
not the pizza place,

05:25.314 --> 05:27.886
not the bleachers where I watch
the guy mow the lawn.

05:28.019 --> 05:30.024
The school trusted me
with its mascot,

05:30.142 --> 05:32.500
and I have let everyone down.

05:32.673 --> 05:34.038
This is a disaster!

05:34.752 --> 05:36.985
I'm literally a chicken
with its head cut off.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.838
<i>Well, she wasn't the only one.</i>
<i>Three days until Thanksgiving,</i>

05:39.953 --> 05:42.167
<i>and we were</i>
<i>nowhere near Marine-ready.</i>

05:42.319 --> 05:45.039
Ugh! I just want everything
to look right for the Marines.

05:45.161 --> 05:48.380
If I use this picture
to cover the wallpaper scar,

05:48.493 --> 05:49.544
does that look okay?

05:49.657 --> 05:51.479
I'd lower it, like, 2 inches.

05:51.605 --> 05:54.469
Yeah, listen to her.
She's the expert on everything.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.079
I married Mrs. Right.

05:56.232 --> 05:58.327
I just didn't know
her first name was "always."

05:58.615 --> 05:59.778
(Sighs)
(Brick) Get this--

05:59.906 --> 06:01.466
apparently,
the scenes in Love Story

06:01.583 --> 06:04.364
with Oliver walking through
a snowy New York were added

06:04.491 --> 06:06.879
after principal photography
was completed.

06:07.125 --> 06:07.935
<i>After!</i>

06:08.041 --> 06:10.253
Oh, I just adored Love Story.

06:10.401 --> 06:13.632
Hey, Brick, why don't
I rent us a copy,

06:13.752 --> 06:15.438
and you and I
can watch it together?

06:15.839 --> 06:17.186
Why would we do that?

06:17.371 --> 06:20.917
I'm with you, Brick.
Love Story was a lousy movie.

06:21.028 --> 06:21.888
What do <i>you</i> know?

06:22.009 --> 06:24.267
You slept through it
like every movie we see.

06:24.381 --> 06:26.550
Then you woke up
and said it didn't make sense.

06:26.657 --> 06:27.997
I'll tell you
what was a good picture.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.845
The Longest Day.
You ever see that?

06:30.019 --> 06:31.950
Don't need to.
I'm living it.

06:32.524 --> 06:33.669
(Vacuum whirring)

06:34.354 --> 06:35.662
(Exhales deeply)

06:37.091 --> 06:38.640
Ugh. Jeez.

06:39.167 --> 06:40.706
What is wrong with my parents?

06:41.080 --> 06:42.660
You're gonna
have to be more specific.

06:42.789 --> 06:45.276
The bickering.
It's nuts, right?

06:45.389 --> 06:47.298
I don't get it. I mean,
it seems to be getting worse.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.532
It's worse, right?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.083
Frankie, they've
been together 50 years.

06:50.317 --> 06:51.391
Just be happy
they're not starring

06:51.524 --> 06:53.611
in a Dateline unsolved mystery.

06:53.845 --> 06:55.671
(Sighs)
Well, I'm almost wondering

06:55.797 --> 06:58.505
if having the Marines here
is a good idea at all.

06:58.624 --> 07:00.669
- Now you're wondering?
- You know what it is?

07:00.870 --> 07:02.187
They've been alone too long.

07:02.398 --> 07:05.234
Maybe we need to remind them
why they love each other.

07:05.353 --> 07:07.010
Like, reboot their brains

07:07.164 --> 07:08.934
so they start being nice
to each other again.

07:09.418 --> 07:11.569
(Tag) What'd you do
with my goji berries?

07:11.718 --> 07:14.460
(Pat) Oh, yeah, I live
<i>to hide your goji berries!</i>

07:14.617 --> 07:16.156
Good luck with that.

07:17.660 --> 07:19.025
(School bell rings)

07:24.357 --> 07:25.202
(Gasps)

07:26.155 --> 07:27.501
(Dog barks in distance)

07:28.651 --> 07:29.948
Come on.
I'll throw you a couple.

07:30.058 --> 07:32.216
No, thanks.
I'm kind of busy here.

07:32.775 --> 07:34.234
You're poking the earth
with a stick.

07:35.043 --> 07:36.510
What's going on with you, Axl?

07:36.626 --> 07:38.687
You got a huge game Friday.
The big comeback.

07:38.813 --> 07:40.187
Everybody from school's
gonna be there.

07:40.551 --> 07:41.662
Not everybody.

07:42.022 --> 07:42.881
What's that mean?

07:43.283 --> 07:44.244
Nothing.

07:45.179 --> 07:45.860
Hmm.

07:47.581 --> 07:49.439
So... (Clears throat)
Help me out here.

07:50.008 --> 07:51.178
The other day
when the doctor said

07:51.280 --> 07:52.663
you could play
in the game on Friday,

07:52.889 --> 07:54.143
weren't you the guy
who asked him

07:54.236 --> 07:55.128
if you could kiss him
on the mouth?

07:55.231 --> 07:57.926
Yeah. I was excited,
but then I started thinkin'...

07:58.128 --> 08:00.726
(Sighs) You know,
this whole studying thing

08:00.822 --> 08:01.779
is kind of working out for me.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.179
Maybe I should just
stick to that.

08:03.340 --> 08:04.271
Studying.

08:04.628 --> 08:07.541
Okay. I think I know
what's going on here.

08:07.852 --> 08:10.436
You're nervous.
You haven't played in a while.

08:10.537 --> 08:12.465
There's a lot riding
on this game. I get that, Axl.

08:12.565 --> 08:14.563
But sometimes you just gotta
lay it all out there

08:14.704 --> 08:15.989
and go for it.

08:16.722 --> 08:18.112
I don't know.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.814
Trust me. Don't ever
let fear stop you

08:20.930 --> 08:22.533
from going after what you want.

08:25.711 --> 08:28.226
<i>Mike's advice</i>
<i>really hit home for Axl...</i>

08:29.151 --> 08:31.493
<i>Just not exactly</i>
<i>the way Mike had intended.</i>

08:31.596 --> 08:33.173
Cassidy, I like you.

08:33.833 --> 08:35.352
(Door closes) I never really saw
myself with a girl like you before.

08:35.467 --> 08:36.727
You know, I usually
just go for hot chicks.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.214
Not that you're...
(Chuckles) not hot.

08:38.328 --> 08:39.884
It's just you're just hot
in a different way.

08:40.035 --> 08:41.751
Um, you use words
like "perseverating"

08:41.884 --> 08:43.991
and "truncated," which is
a really cool word for "short,"

08:44.096 --> 08:45.830
but I never knew that
until I met you.

08:45.930 --> 08:47.852
And I have so many things
to say to you,

08:47.952 --> 08:49.680
but I'll try
to keep it truncated. (Chuckles)

08:49.785 --> 08:50.779
I like hanging out with you.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.818
I think it's cool
that you think I can be smart

08:52.925 --> 08:54.107
and you listen to violin music,

08:54.221 --> 08:55.693
and you watch movies
with the typing at the bottom.

08:55.797 --> 08:57.836
And my whole life,
I have loved football,

08:57.932 --> 08:59.930
but it's weird, 'cause it just
doesn't seem to matter to me

09:00.038 --> 09:00.987
if it doesn't matter to you.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.013
And I want you to come
to my game, Cassidy.

09:03.225 --> 09:05.313
And I know you have this guy
who calls you from college,

09:05.432 --> 09:06.708
but he's not here now,
and I am,

09:06.810 --> 09:08.736
and I like you, and I think
you should go out with me.

09:09.948 --> 09:10.739
(Chuckles nervously)

09:10.864 --> 09:14.451
Oh. Wow, Axl. That's...

09:14.596 --> 09:15.455
a lot.

09:15.602 --> 09:17.836
Seriously, that is all
so nice of you to say,

09:17.963 --> 09:19.373
but I-I just--

09:19.671 --> 09:21.944
see, my boyfriend's coming
to spend Thanksgiving with me,

09:22.077 --> 09:24.528
so I don't think
I can come to your game,

09:24.716 --> 09:25.778
but thanks.

09:25.922 --> 09:28.122
I mean, yeah, thank you.

09:30.139 --> 09:32.403
Uh... (Chuckles nervously)
Yeah, cool. Cool. Cool.

09:32.519 --> 09:33.618
Uh... (Clears throat)
You know... (Laughs)

09:33.772 --> 09:35.991
I just... I'm asking
everybody to my game,

09:36.154 --> 09:38.942
not just you. So...
(Inhales deeply)

09:39.047 --> 09:41.889
Hey! Anybody wanna go watch me
play football Friday night?

09:41.991 --> 09:44.223
I'd love to, Axl.
Can I bring my snake?

09:53.989 --> 09:55.081
What do you think?

09:55.246 --> 09:57.181
Well, that depends.
Is there gonna be a president

09:57.296 --> 09:58.959
giving a speech
off the back of a train?

09:59.112 --> 10:01.856
(Refrigerator door opens) I just want
it to look patriotic for the Marines,

10:01.981 --> 10:03.233
to show we care, you know?

10:03.350 --> 10:05.690
Because they do
so much for our country.

10:05.818 --> 10:07.495
It's the least we can do
for them.

10:07.637 --> 10:09.826
Wow. Okay, can I tell you guys
one more thing?

10:09.984 --> 10:11.091
- No.
- Nobody cares, Brick.

10:11.199 --> 10:12.640
Who do you think
was the studio's first choice

10:12.771 --> 10:14.000
for the part of Oliver?

10:14.853 --> 10:18.314
It was Beau Bridges.
Can you believe it? Uh...

10:19.583 --> 10:20.645
Who's Beau Bridges?

10:20.752 --> 10:23.367
I asked you to do one thing--
pack my ginkgo biloba.

10:23.479 --> 10:24.854
They're <i>your</i> ginkgo biloba.

10:24.969 --> 10:26.207
You want 'em,
you gonna pack 'em.

10:26.315 --> 10:28.816
- You're a grown man, for God sake.
- They're for my memory!

10:28.992 --> 10:30.443
How in the hell am I
supposed to remember 'em

10:30.567 --> 10:31.419
if I don't take 'em?

10:31.519 --> 10:33.610
Mom, dad, Mike and I
were trying to remember

10:33.729 --> 10:37.187
that great story you always tell
about your first date.

10:37.318 --> 10:39.542
You know, how dad got lost
and you ended up by the lake?

10:39.651 --> 10:40.449
What happened again?

10:40.568 --> 10:42.104
(Chuckles)
Oh, he got lost all right.

10:42.248 --> 10:43.724
No surprise there.

10:43.848 --> 10:47.524
- Yeah, she was probably talking so much,
I missed the sign. - No, it was sweet.

10:47.644 --> 10:49.479
You got lost and you
didn't have anything to eat,

10:49.603 --> 10:51.620
and mom pulled the crackers
from her bag and--

10:51.732 --> 10:53.013
Back then,
he would <i>eat</i> crackers!

10:53.129 --> 10:54.557
Crackers are poison!

10:54.794 --> 10:56.366
Might as well
eat a bag of sugar!

10:59.018 --> 11:00.145
Oh. Excuse me.

11:00.273 --> 11:01.403
Can we have
a word with you gentlemen?

11:01.606 --> 11:02.291
Sure.

11:02.474 --> 11:03.479
We would have
talked to you earlier,

11:03.585 --> 11:04.947
but we didn't want
to disrupt your rehearsal.

11:05.122 --> 11:05.920
Practice.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.791
Which one of you
is captain of this company?

11:09.122 --> 11:10.532
Team. He meant "team."

11:10.662 --> 11:12.654
Look, we know
you stole our mascot head.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.757
So the joke is over.
We want it back.

11:14.955 --> 11:17.502
Oh, no. You lost your head?
I guess it's true what they say

11:17.621 --> 11:19.967
about how the body still runs
around without its head.

11:20.126 --> 11:22.628
See you Friday night, losers.

11:22.915 --> 11:26.480
- That's it. There's only one
way to settle this. - No! Brad!

11:26.584 --> 11:28.787
Dance fight! Five, six, seven, eight...
(Snaps fingers)

11:29.140 --> 11:31.411
Who punches a guy
while he's on his tippy toes?

11:31.510 --> 11:33.291
That's not
how a dance fight works.

11:33.476 --> 11:36.629
I mean, seriously, where did
that guy go to summer camp?

11:36.750 --> 11:38.131
Ugh. I know.

11:39.121 --> 11:40.912
I didn't even get to do
my pas de bourree.

11:41.019 --> 11:41.846
Aw.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.604
<i>(Tv playing indistinctly)</i> In Mexico,
it's known as <i>Historia de Amor.</i>

11:45.814 --> 11:48.862
In Finland, it's <i>Rakkaustarina.</i>

11:49.091 --> 11:50.472
I feel like
you're not listening.

11:50.817 --> 11:51.673
That's because I'm not, Brick.

11:51.785 --> 11:53.066
The Marines are gonna
be here any minute.

11:53.248 --> 11:56.584
Axl, put on some clothes
and comb your hair!

11:56.751 --> 11:59.352
To what end, mom?
To what end?

11:59.532 --> 12:00.554
(Sighs)

12:00.868 --> 12:02.040
Mike, I'm gonna be busy
with the Marines,

12:02.172 --> 12:02.913
so you're in charge

12:03.026 --> 12:04.329
of corralling the bickermans
at dinner.

12:04.508 --> 12:06.515
How come you get the Marines,
and I get your parents?

12:06.622 --> 12:07.796
Because you didn't want
the Marines here.

12:07.954 --> 12:09.722
In my defense, I didn't want
your parents here, either.

12:09.888 --> 12:11.214
(Doorbell rings) Oh!

12:11.371 --> 12:12.206
Okay, that's them.

12:12.326 --> 12:14.155
Quick,
everybody put your flag pins on.

12:17.257 --> 12:19.217
Well, hello there.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.084
(Laughs) Wow, we got
a couple of good ones.

12:21.207 --> 12:22.581
Hi. I'm Frankie Heck.

12:22.738 --> 12:24.044
Corporal Nick Martinez.

12:24.227 --> 12:25.529
Sergeant Justin Howard.

12:25.787 --> 12:26.594
We can't thank you enough

12:26.713 --> 12:27.954
for inviting us
into your home, ma'am.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.262
Oh, please.
It's the least we could do.

12:30.365 --> 12:32.484
You do so much for us.
(Chuckles)

12:32.626 --> 12:36.458
Wow. I love your uniforms--
the badges and the stripes.

12:36.575 --> 12:39.950
I don't know what they mean,
but you must be very brave.

12:40.313 --> 12:41.518
Hey, Nancy!

12:41.649 --> 12:43.796
Just having dinner
with America's heroes--

12:43.932 --> 12:44.790
two of 'em!

12:44.896 --> 12:46.204
Happy Thanksgiving!

12:46.306 --> 12:47.656
So the screenplay
was turned down

12:47.788 --> 12:49.326
by every studio in Hollywood,

12:49.442 --> 12:52.823
but Segal's agent, Howard Minsky
of the William Morris Agency--

12:52.938 --> 12:54.374
This is my son Brick.

12:54.481 --> 12:55.471
(Book thuds)
That's my other son Axl.

12:55.579 --> 12:57.110
He's just waiting
for the iron to heat up

12:57.232 --> 12:58.935
so he can press his slacks.

12:59.067 --> 13:00.322
What are slacks?

13:00.429 --> 13:01.730
(Teeth clenched) Get dressed.

13:01.856 --> 13:03.683
Mom, does this say
"chicken" to you?

13:03.876 --> 13:05.804
This is my daughter Sue.

13:06.106 --> 13:08.510
And oh, this is
my great aunt Edie,

13:08.643 --> 13:11.515
and my parents Pat and Tag,
and my husband Mike.

13:11.684 --> 13:13.335
You have
a very beautiful home, sir.

13:13.538 --> 13:16.219
Well, you've seen too many
bombed-out cities, but thanks.

13:16.332 --> 13:19.101
So, um, Corporal,
why don't you sit there,

13:19.287 --> 13:21.287
and, Sergeant,
you can sit there.

13:21.387 --> 13:23.170
So it'll be
Marine-Frankie-Marine.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.333
Just like a Marine sandwich.
(Laughs)

13:26.394 --> 13:27.900
Or we can sit wherever.

13:28.018 --> 13:31.268
Look at this. All poison.
I can't eat any of it.

13:31.386 --> 13:33.134
Eat it, don't eat it.
Nobody cares.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.302
Hey, you two lovebirds
don't mind

13:34.413 --> 13:35.752
if I squeeze in here, do ya?

13:36.840 --> 13:38.506
Well, shall we get started?

13:39.609 --> 13:44.124
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America.

13:45.454 --> 13:46.743
Just wanted
to get that out there.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.889
You know,
where my allegiance lies.

13:49.744 --> 13:51.386
So before we eat, um,

13:51.527 --> 13:52.855
why don't we go
around the table

13:52.960 --> 13:54.423
and everybody say
what they're thankful for?

13:54.525 --> 13:56.305
It's kind of
our Thanksgiving tradition.

13:56.443 --> 13:57.800
- It is?
- Since when?

13:57.945 --> 13:59.371
(Clears throat) I'll start.

13:59.909 --> 14:03.269
Well, I'm thankful
for the freedom

14:03.408 --> 14:06.605
that you two provide
with your guns and stuff.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.549
And I have to say, I, for one,

14:08.716 --> 14:11.453
have never felt
so safe in my own home.

14:12.492 --> 14:14.028
I'm thankful
for all my fellow Marines

14:14.149 --> 14:16.282
who put themselves
in harm's way every day

14:16.469 --> 14:18.303
so we can all live and prosper

14:18.423 --> 14:20.173
in the greatest country
in the world.

14:21.221 --> 14:23.262
I'm thankful that
the theme from Love Story

14:23.429 --> 14:26.061
hit number 39
on the US music charts.

14:26.194 --> 14:29.370
I'm thankful I'm still running
on my own steam.

14:29.538 --> 14:30.323
(Giggles)

14:30.436 --> 14:31.981
What the hell's that mean?
Don't make any sense.

14:32.176 --> 14:35.182
I think I'm allowed
to say what I'm thankful for

14:35.311 --> 14:37.621
without comments
from the peanut gallery.

14:37.779 --> 14:39.463
I'd like to go in a different
direction this year

14:39.594 --> 14:41.507
and say what I am not
thankful for.

14:41.690 --> 14:43.993
I am not thankful
for Roosevelt High,

14:44.134 --> 14:46.539
specifically the football
players at Roosevelt High,

14:46.693 --> 14:48.054
who cheat at dance fights

14:48.192 --> 14:49.796
and steal
people's chicken heads.

14:50.616 --> 14:52.256
- Axl?
- Pass.

14:52.844 --> 14:55.295
- Aunt Edie?
- Merry Christmas!

14:55.462 --> 14:57.503
I'm thankful that's over.
Who wants some potatoes?

14:57.627 --> 14:59.437
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I-I didn't get my turn.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.402
I was gonna tell the story

15:00.527 --> 15:02.546
about how when I was
stationed in Korea--

15:02.678 --> 15:03.930
You were a file clerk.

15:04.050 --> 15:06.010
(Tag) Hey, there was a lot
of tension in that office!

15:06.202 --> 15:07.796
Um, hey, uh,

15:07.975 --> 15:12.136
so, uh, I bet being
a Marine... keeps you busy.

15:12.308 --> 15:14.451
Actually, we just did
a recon mission if Afghanistan

15:14.590 --> 15:16.128
to recover a downed drone.

15:16.325 --> 15:17.163
Wait a minute.

15:17.331 --> 15:20.810
Say there was some sort of
top-secret object

15:20.938 --> 15:23.055
hidden somewhere
in Roosevelt High School.

15:23.230 --> 15:24.902
Would you two
be able to recover it?

15:25.033 --> 15:27.115
Sue, the Marines aren't helping
you find your chicken head.

15:27.237 --> 15:28.279
It's their day off.

15:28.629 --> 15:31.074
So, Afghanistan-- that must
have been so dangerous.

15:31.267 --> 15:32.980
Well, when you're dealing
with terrorists,

15:33.124 --> 15:34.424
it can get a little sticky.

15:34.637 --> 15:36.892
Well, the real enemy
isn't terrorists.

15:37.050 --> 15:38.558
It's refined sugar.

15:38.727 --> 15:41.328
Kills a hell of a lot more
people than Al Qaeda ever did.

15:41.456 --> 15:42.343
You don't have to talk

15:42.449 --> 15:44.107
everybody's head off
all the time.

15:44.325 --> 15:46.648
You know, they hide from him
at the bank.

15:46.762 --> 15:49.110
You're just jealous 'cause
the weight's falling off of me.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.894
Somebody here has
a love affair with gluten.

15:52.021 --> 15:53.675
Speaking of gluten,
you guys like football?

15:53.847 --> 15:55.887
'Cause, uh, my son here
has got a big game tomorrow.

15:56.037 --> 15:57.859
I don't even
wanna talk about the game.

15:57.976 --> 15:59.499
Why do we have to
talk about the game?

15:59.678 --> 16:01.714
I think I have a pretty good
idea of where it is.

16:01.855 --> 16:04.357
If we go in at nightfall,
I think that would be best.

16:04.498 --> 16:05.479
But I don't have to go

16:05.593 --> 16:06.728
if you think I'm just
gonna get in the way.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.333
I could be sitting
in a nearby van,

16:08.475 --> 16:10.546
talking you through it
over headphones.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.489
(Tag) It was a moonless night.
I was stationed in Korea.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.632
- And my boot came untied--
- Everyone's heard the story, Tag.

16:16.761 --> 16:18.499
You tell it every Thanksgiving.

16:18.626 --> 16:19.994
The Marines haven't heard it.

16:20.116 --> 16:23.167
Yes, they have. You've told
that story so many times,

16:23.291 --> 16:24.795
it's gone all the way
around the world,

16:24.929 --> 16:26.811
and even <i>they</i> have heard it.

16:26.926 --> 16:28.051
You know, if you
got some sleep,

16:28.177 --> 16:30.566
- you wouldn't be so cranky.
- And whose fault is that?

16:30.687 --> 16:32.070
You took my side of the bed.

16:32.189 --> 16:34.338
I told you many times,
it's different here.

16:34.470 --> 16:35.904
The bed's turned around.

16:36.025 --> 16:38.312
I think I know how to sleep.

16:38.438 --> 16:40.249
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
(Silverware clatters)

16:40.409 --> 16:42.900
You had your first date
on St. Patrick's Day,

16:43.035 --> 16:44.360
and dad wanted
to take you to the movies,

16:44.484 --> 16:46.312
but he got lost, and you thought
it was so funny.

16:46.451 --> 16:48.340
And you ended up
down by Lake Monroe,

16:48.478 --> 16:49.154
and you were hungry,

16:49.285 --> 16:50.742
so mom shared her saltines
from her purse.

16:50.913 --> 16:51.999
And you were both worried

16:52.128 --> 16:53.471
because the crackers
made your mouth dry

16:53.609 --> 16:55.316
and you thought your first kiss
was gonna be disastrous.

16:55.451 --> 16:57.310
But it wasn't,
because you kissed,

16:57.453 --> 16:58.653
and you felt the earth move,

16:58.793 --> 17:00.185
and you knew you were supposed
to be together

17:00.323 --> 17:02.617
because you loved each other,
damn it!

17:03.561 --> 17:05.124
(Breathing heavily)

17:05.690 --> 17:06.580
(Door opens)

17:06.991 --> 17:07.875
<i>They've been through war,</i>

17:07.983 --> 17:10.059
<i>and they couldn't even</i>
<i>make it to pie.</i>

17:17.718 --> 17:18.670
<i>So as we learned,</i>

17:18.790 --> 17:21.288
<i>Thanksgiving is not</i>
<i>a holiday for observers.</i>

17:21.542 --> 17:22.262
<i>And the next day,</i>

17:22.387 --> 17:25.085
<i>we were still stewing</i>
<i>in our own family juices.</i>

17:25.271 --> 17:26.752
(Players grunting,
crowd cheering)

17:26.917 --> 17:28.000
<i>(Man over PA)</i>
<i>Heck is the ball carrier.</i>

17:28.655 --> 17:29.455
(Thud)

17:30.122 --> 17:31.650
(Whistle blows, crowd groans)

17:31.761 --> 17:32.820
<i>And it's a fumble.</i>

17:33.641 --> 17:35.694
<i>That's Heck's third fumble</i>
<i>of the game.</i>

17:36.180 --> 17:37.448
(Crowd speaking indistinctly)

17:41.452 --> 17:42.798
<i>Sue blamed herself.</i>

17:42.924 --> 17:46.010
<i>Without her mascot head, she</i>
<i>just couldn't bring the spirit.</i>

17:46.141 --> 17:47.849
<i>Luckily, Brad scrounged up</i>
<i>what he could</i>

17:47.968 --> 17:50.319
<i>from his theater camp,</i>
<i>but the thundering chicken bear</i>

17:50.445 --> 17:53.101
<i>didn't exactly</i>
<i>scream confidence.</i>

17:53.226 --> 17:56.062
<i>Wilson drops back to pass.</i>
<i>He finds Axl Heck.</i>

17:56.196 --> 17:57.797
<i>Heck drops the ball!</i>

17:59.346 --> 18:01.713
And I thought
the end of Love Story was sad.

18:02.416 --> 18:03.058
(Crowd groaning)

18:03.159 --> 18:04.227
Time-out. Time-out.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.055
(Whistle blows)

18:05.200 --> 18:06.482
<i>Time-out-- Orson.</i>

18:06.607 --> 18:08.561
Come on, guys!
Bring it in. Bring it in.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.343
Axl, what is going on with you?

18:14.485 --> 18:16.872
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing.

18:16.989 --> 18:17.621
I'm trying to focus,

18:17.745 --> 18:19.159
but all these thoughts
keep popping into my head.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.643
I keep thinking maybe
I shouldn't have played.

18:20.796 --> 18:22.073
And then I think
I should be studying more.

18:22.195 --> 18:23.639
Then I think what if I hurt
my foot even worse?

18:23.736 --> 18:24.830
I'm freaking myself out here!

18:24.962 --> 18:27.253
Axl, that's your problem.
You're thinking too much.

18:27.420 --> 18:28.402
What?

18:28.520 --> 18:30.495
Everything good that's ever
happened to you in your life

18:30.631 --> 18:32.900
happened because
you weren't thinking.

18:33.140 --> 18:36.545
Look at me. Look at me!
(Grunts)

18:38.282 --> 18:39.472
The only way
you're gonna win this game

18:39.606 --> 18:42.371
is if you go out there
and do what you do best.

18:42.486 --> 18:45.140
Don't think.
You get back out there,

18:45.275 --> 18:47.956
turn your brain off,
and win this game!

18:48.762 --> 18:50.250
<i>Sometimes the wisest advice</i>

18:50.382 --> 18:52.615
<i>comes from the mouths</i>
<i>of chicken bears.</i>

18:52.738 --> 18:55.026
- Go!
- Yes! Whoo!

18:55.770 --> 18:56.676
(Thud)

19:02.159 --> 19:03.196
<i>The hand-off goes to Heck.</i>

19:03.308 --> 19:05.525
<i>He runs left.</i>
<i>Heck reverses field!</i>

19:05.688 --> 19:08.196
<i>Heck is running</i>
<i>for the wrong end zone!</i>

19:08.336 --> 19:09.379
What is he thinking?!

19:09.970 --> 19:11.387
(Squeals) He's not!

19:12.952 --> 19:15.005
(Cheering)

19:15.618 --> 19:17.731
Go, go, go, go!
Go! Yes!

19:18.364 --> 19:20.093
(Cheering)

19:23.394 --> 19:24.856
Touchdown. Yeah!

19:27.164 --> 19:28.438
Whoo!

19:33.201 --> 19:36.219
<i>Sue's speech worked.</i>
<i>Once Axl stopped thinking,</i>

19:36.441 --> 19:37.780
<i>he scored two more touchdowns</i>

19:37.888 --> 19:40.215
<i>and led his team</i>
<i>to the city championship.</i>

19:40.901 --> 19:42.286
(Whistle blows)

19:42.938 --> 19:45.243
(Cheering continues)

19:52.760 --> 19:55.443
Hey! That was one hell
of a second half

19:55.576 --> 19:57.011
you played there, Heck.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.766
I'm really hoping to see you
and that healed foot of yours

19:59.889 --> 20:01.399
at East Indy next year.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.633
Yeah? Me and my foot
would love that.

20:03.764 --> 20:05.629
All right! Go, Dragons!

20:05.813 --> 20:07.469
(Laughs) (Laughs)
(Exhales deeply)

20:12.210 --> 20:13.992
(Whooping and laughing)

20:22.137 --> 20:23.102
Hey.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.579
(Sighs) Hey.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.478
<i>That</i> was an amazing game.

20:27.603 --> 20:29.168
I've never seen
anything like it.

20:29.827 --> 20:31.104
I'm not gonna tell you
you were awesome,

20:31.221 --> 20:33.024
'cause you already <i>think</i>
you're awesome.

20:33.155 --> 20:34.588
But that was pretty awesome.

20:34.741 --> 20:36.482
Wait, you--
you saw the game?

20:36.579 --> 20:37.814
I thought you had dinner
with your boyfriend.

20:37.936 --> 20:40.299
Yeah, well,
that kind of got cut short

20:40.408 --> 20:42.949
when I told him
that I like somebody else.

20:43.475 --> 20:44.570
You like somebody else?

20:44.834 --> 20:47.239
Yeah. You.

20:47.422 --> 20:48.758
Oh. (Laughs)

20:49.165 --> 20:51.416
Sorry, I've been told
not to think. (Chuckles)

20:52.227 --> 20:53.524
Do you have any plans?

20:53.646 --> 20:56.721
Yeah, but...
I can blow 'em off.

20:56.883 --> 20:58.287
What'd you have in mind?

20:59.142 --> 21:00.244
This.

21:04.983 --> 21:07.423
<i>We never did quite get why</i>
<i>Brick loved that book so much.</i>

21:07.591 --> 21:10.404
<i>Maybe it's 'cause everyone</i>
<i>loves a great love story.</i>

21:10.547 --> 21:12.644
<i>Whether it's that magical</i>
<i>moment at the beginning</i>

21:12.760 --> 21:14.542
<i>when everything</i>
<i>is new and exciting,</i>

21:14.790 --> 21:17.412
<i>or even when</i>
<i>it's not so new and exciting.</i>

21:17.644 --> 21:19.921
(Pat) What are you doing?
We're supposed to be on I-70.

21:20.081 --> 21:22.028
(Tag) I'm not taking 70.
I know a shortcut.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.106
Oh, God, not another shortcut.

21:24.412 --> 21:26.314
We'll be lucky
if we're home by Christmas.

21:26.430 --> 21:28.180
Fine, fine. We'll take 70.

21:28.637 --> 21:30.816
But only because you're cute.
(Chuckles)

21:30.951 --> 21:33.262
Oh. (Laughs)

21:33.952 --> 21:35.782
<i>After all,</i>
<i>the greatest love stories</i>

21:35.904 --> 21:37.877
<i>are the ones that last forever.</i>
