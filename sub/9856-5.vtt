WEBVTT

00:11.015 --> 00:12.015
Why not?

00:13.175 --> 00:15.855
Because you are not staying out
all night with some older boy.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.695
Julian is not some older
boy. He lives down the street.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.535
That doesn't change his age.

00:20.735 --> 00:21.735
Mom?

00:22.055 --> 00:23.055
Please!

00:23.295 --> 00:25.375
Why doesn't Julian just
come here for dinner,

00:25.615 --> 00:27.415
and then you two can watch a movie?

00:27.535 --> 00:29.255
So Dad can sit between us?

00:29.415 --> 00:30.615
Just next to you.

00:31.095 --> 00:32.095
See?

00:32.295 --> 00:33.815
This is so unfair!

00:36.295 --> 00:37.895
Oh, my God. Frank!

00:38.175 --> 00:40.095
- What happened?
- I had an accident.

00:43.015 --> 00:44.695
- Come in, please.
- DankeschÃ¶n. Thank you.

00:45.095 --> 00:46.775
- Who are you?
- Wait! What are you doing?

01:39.655 --> 01:40.815
Mr. Deprez?

01:46.255 --> 01:47.295
Anne?

01:56.375 --> 01:57.375
Yeah.

01:58.295 --> 02:00.215
Yeah, that's right, that one.

02:11.735 --> 02:13.695
Eric, I have to go now.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.215
- I'll call you tomorrow, okay?
- Okay, Daddy.

02:30.055 --> 02:31.335
Chief Inspector Galland?

02:32.375 --> 02:34.935
I'm Investigator Hickman from the ICC?

02:35.135 --> 02:36.175
Right, yes.

02:36.335 --> 02:38.415
These are my colleagues, Berger, Vittoria.

02:38.615 --> 02:40.055
- Hi.
- We spoke last night, sir.

02:40.175 --> 02:41.495
Thank you for coming so soon.

02:42.295 --> 02:45.535
German police is working on a
series of six takeover home invasions

02:45.655 --> 02:47.455
that started a little
over than a month ago.

02:47.735 --> 02:48.735
Like this?

02:49.295 --> 02:50.415
Not quite.

02:50.775 --> 02:51.855
No one was murdered.

02:52.415 --> 02:54.615
The perps overpowered and
blindfolded the families,

02:54.735 --> 02:55.735
and then

02:56.015 --> 02:58.335
just took money and property.

02:58.975 --> 03:02.015
But the violence has been escalating
somewhat with every incident.

03:02.415 --> 03:03.735
If these are the same people,

03:03.975 --> 03:06.895
the violence escalated
a lot more than somewhat.

03:07.015 --> 03:08.015
You mean...

03:08.695 --> 03:10.975
- Is the entire family dead?
- Yes.

03:11.535 --> 03:14.255
The father was briefly conscious
when the uniforms arrived.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.655
He only said one word, "German"

03:17.615 --> 03:18.615
German?

03:18.775 --> 03:20.455
I assumed he meant the perpetrators,

03:21.095 --> 03:22.215
but I can't be sure.

03:22.415 --> 03:24.191
The call was anonymous.
You couldn't trace it?

03:24.215 --> 03:25.215
Right.

03:26.815 --> 03:27.815
Shall we?

03:27.895 --> 03:28.895
No, thanks.

03:29.975 --> 03:31.055
I've seen enough.

03:31.615 --> 03:33.215
I'll be here if you have any questions.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.855
Looks like they were more
interested in damage than theft.

03:55.855 --> 03:58.215
I've sent all the German
files over to the office.

03:59.615 --> 04:01.375
We'll get a full
inventory of missing items,

04:01.575 --> 04:03.815
but I remember electronics
and jewelry stolen.

04:04.455 --> 04:05.495
Easily fenced.

04:08.575 --> 04:09.735
Oh, God...

04:14.415 --> 04:15.975
Never gets easier when it's children.

04:17.495 --> 04:18.495
No.

04:19.375 --> 04:21.415
You should get your scanner
over here, Sebastian.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.455
Doesn't look like there
are any ridge impressions.

04:25.055 --> 04:26.255
Probably gloves.

04:27.015 --> 04:28.055
They wore boots.

04:29.455 --> 04:30.455
See here?

04:30.735 --> 04:31.735
Have a look.

04:36.015 --> 04:37.055
Wait a minute.

04:38.775 --> 04:40.055
I recognize the logo.

04:40.255 --> 04:41.775
It's German motorcycle gear.

04:43.375 --> 04:46.055
I think there were two
boot prints just like this

04:46.255 --> 04:48.215
found in the mud at the scene in Germany.

04:49.015 --> 04:50.495
I've got the pictures somewhere.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.495
Here we go.

04:56.695 --> 05:00.095
I have the boot prints from
both scenes on my screen.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.775
They look pretty identical to me.

05:03.575 --> 05:05.535
The same kind of boot is circumstantial.

05:06.375 --> 05:08.215
Close to the same size, too.

05:08.735 --> 05:09.735
"Close to."

05:09.775 --> 05:11.895
This murder scene is
less than 50 miles away

05:12.095 --> 05:13.695
from the last home invasion in Germany.

05:13.935 --> 05:16.696
That's a relatively small area to
have two different patterns running.

05:17.095 --> 05:18.375
But not impossible.

05:18.655 --> 05:20.055
Is it enough to take to Dorn?

05:20.295 --> 05:21.335
It's enough to try.

05:21.575 --> 05:24.295
Look, tell Dorn if these
are the same guys, then...

05:26.975 --> 05:29.775
then this could get worse, because
they've got a taste for it now.

06:05.295 --> 06:07.175
Famke, it's lovely.

06:07.775 --> 06:09.655
I heard you say orchids are your favorite.

06:11.335 --> 06:14.495
Well, it looks kind of lonely there.

06:14.815 --> 06:17.375
"If we could see the miracle
of a single flower clearly...

06:17.575 --> 06:19.295
our whole life would change."

06:21.375 --> 06:22.375
The Buddha.

06:23.255 --> 06:24.255
Indeed.

06:24.895 --> 06:26.615
Louis has a potential case for us.

06:27.015 --> 06:28.015
Potential?

06:28.095 --> 06:30.535
Well, because the cross-border
elements are not yet certain.

06:30.975 --> 06:32.735
Six German cases, one in Belgium,

06:33.695 --> 06:35.935
but I need a list of all the similarities

06:36.135 --> 06:38.735
to see if there is a pattern
that I can present to the Court.

06:40.615 --> 06:41.895
We don't a lot of time.

06:43.055 --> 06:44.615
If this is the same group,

06:45.095 --> 06:47.935
they've already murdered
an entire family in Veviers.

06:50.775 --> 06:53.535
Sebastian is bringing his
equipment in. We need to identify

06:53.695 --> 06:54.935
who called this in.

06:55.775 --> 06:57.255
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

06:57.415 --> 06:59.535
And then we'll know why they
wanted to stay anonymous.

07:03.055 --> 07:04.135
These the family phones?

07:04.455 --> 07:06.735
Father and mother. We're
having the sim cards processed.

07:07.735 --> 07:08.935
Did you find the girl's phone?

07:10.335 --> 07:11.895
Teenage girl must have a cell phone.

07:12.255 --> 07:13.415
We didn't find one.

07:14.335 --> 07:15.375
Where's her room?

07:15.935 --> 07:17.095
Second door upstairs.

07:17.935 --> 07:18.975
I'll go upstairs.

08:23.175 --> 08:25.015
Her texts stop at 21:52.

08:26.175 --> 08:28.495
Sebastian, what time did
the emergency call go out?

08:28.695 --> 08:29.855
22:05.

08:30.015 --> 08:31.255
13 minutes later.

08:31.735 --> 08:32.934
There's something else.

08:36.695 --> 08:37.695
Hi.

08:37.975 --> 08:38.775
Hi.

08:38.895 --> 08:40.975
I'm Eva, and this is Hickman.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.975
Do you know the people up the street?

08:45.055 --> 08:46.055
The people?

08:47.695 --> 08:49.455
Tell me you don't know which people I mean?

08:50.655 --> 08:52.895
The family with a dozen
police cars out front.

08:53.815 --> 08:55.175
Your name is Julian, right?

08:56.415 --> 08:58.455
- Yes.
- Know how I know that?

08:59.535 --> 09:02.535
You stopped texting her ten minutes
before the police were contacted.

09:06.495 --> 09:08.375
Do you mind if I have a word with him?

09:08.535 --> 09:09.535
No.

09:16.775 --> 09:18.015
He's having a bad day.

09:23.455 --> 09:25.375
Do you know what happened
to Anne and her family?

09:26.695 --> 09:28.135
Did you go over there last night?

09:29.895 --> 09:30.895
Yes?

09:32.135 --> 09:33.335
Did you find them?

09:36.735 --> 09:38.295
Anne wasn't answering my texts.

09:39.695 --> 09:41.535
I should've known
something bad was happening.

09:41.695 --> 09:42.775
How would you know?

09:45.255 --> 09:47.735
There was a white SUV parked outside.

09:48.535 --> 09:49.775
It had a German tag.

09:50.135 --> 09:52.655
I saw it earlier, but didn't think.

09:53.575 --> 09:55.335
Then it sped out of here past my house.

09:55.735 --> 09:56.895
Just one vehicle?

09:57.815 --> 09:59.615
Because there are two sets of tire tracks.

09:59.895 --> 10:02.135
The other set is probably
from Mr. Deprez's new car.

10:02.495 --> 10:03.815
They must have stolen it.

10:04.215 --> 10:05.375
Did you see how many?

10:06.295 --> 10:07.535
I only saw the woman.

10:07.895 --> 10:08.895
A woman?

10:09.375 --> 10:10.375
Blonde.

10:10.815 --> 10:12.735
She got out of the SUV
and went to the door.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.015
They used a woman as a decoy.

10:16.295 --> 10:17.775
She went to the door first.

10:18.775 --> 10:20.175
The family let her in.

10:21.655 --> 10:22.655
The doorbell.

10:33.095 --> 10:35.015
The Court did not grant its approval.

10:35.655 --> 10:36.495
They did not?

10:36.655 --> 10:39.375
No, it was sympathetic with the
nature of your evidence, but...

10:39.935 --> 10:42.455
it was their opinion that
the cross-border implications

10:42.655 --> 10:44.215
were circumstantial,

10:44.975 --> 10:46.935
and they need a concrete connection.

10:48.575 --> 10:50.095
The Court is the Court, Louis.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.215
Yes.

10:53.295 --> 10:54.575
I will persevere.

10:55.415 --> 10:56.415
Thank you.

11:03.175 --> 11:05.575
The woman should be the last
person to touch the doorbell.

11:07.815 --> 11:10.175
The kid said the door was
already open when he got here.

11:11.415 --> 11:12.815
There is a fresh print.

11:15.335 --> 11:16.335
What is it?

11:16.655 --> 11:17.655
A hit.

11:18.655 --> 11:20.695
Her name is Silke Beck from Essen, Germany.

11:21.295 --> 11:23.015
Probably why the father said German.

11:23.935 --> 11:24.935
She has a record.

11:25.095 --> 11:28.255
Arrests made in Denmark and
France for drugs, prostitution,

11:28.415 --> 11:29.415
and petty theft.

11:29.615 --> 11:30.735
No violence, though?

11:30.855 --> 11:31.975
She's the decoy.

11:32.455 --> 11:34.975
Acts like she needs help, maybe plays hurt.

11:35.335 --> 11:36.695
Gets the family to open the door.

11:36.935 --> 11:37.935
Exactly.

11:37.975 --> 11:40.615
Explains why none of the home
invasions had forced entry.

11:40.935 --> 11:43.375
What does that say there
under identifying marks?

11:43.695 --> 11:44.695
Tattoos?

11:45.415 --> 11:47.455
A thorny rose wrapped around her right arm.

11:47.615 --> 11:49.535
Black angel wings on her shoulder blades.

11:50.455 --> 11:51.615
On her lower back,

11:51.895 --> 11:55.775
a skull wearing a knight's helmet
with the words "Property of Max."

11:56.495 --> 11:58.175
I'd like to have a word with Max.

11:58.375 --> 12:01.295
Is just her being German
enough to make it cross border?

12:01.695 --> 12:02.695
No.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.855
I've talked to the State Police in Germany.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.255
There was a print on the doorbell,

12:07.615 --> 12:09.335
but there was no match in their system.

12:09.655 --> 12:11.615
I've sent them a print of
our scan for comparison.

12:11.855 --> 12:12.855
Good.

12:13.055 --> 12:15.295
That skull logo, I've
seen that somewhere before.

12:16.095 --> 12:18.495
Do you have a tattoo recognition?

12:19.375 --> 12:20.455
Yeah, that.

12:21.015 --> 12:23.095
It's the logo of the
Kavalier Motorcycle Club.

12:23.895 --> 12:25.495
I've dealt with them before.

12:26.015 --> 12:28.455
They're one of the most
infamous biker gangs in Europe.

12:28.895 --> 12:30.615
Some German cities asked the government

12:30.735 --> 12:32.975
to ban their activity
altogether. They're a disaster.

12:33.135 --> 12:35.575
Biker boots, biker tattoos, biker chick.

12:35.975 --> 12:37.375
If it walks like a duck...

12:40.175 --> 12:41.575
Then it's a biker gang.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.295
If it walks like a duck it's a biker gang?

12:44.535 --> 12:45.695
Berger speaking.

12:48.015 --> 12:49.095
Are you sure?

12:50.735 --> 12:51.815
Okay, thanks.

12:53.495 --> 12:56.735
Silke Beck's print is a match to the
print found at the scene in Germany.

12:57.255 --> 12:58.335
That's the...

12:59.415 --> 13:00.455
connection.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.015
Good work. Come home.

13:03.255 --> 13:04.775
We have bikers to catch.

13:35.441 --> 13:38.441
The Kavalier Motorcycle Club
has been around since the '70s,

13:38.641 --> 13:41.641
but its heyday began with
the EU's relaxing of borders.

13:41.841 --> 13:45.081
Their territory has expanded
across Europe and beyond.

13:45.601 --> 13:47.921
The number of chapters has
doubled in the last decade.

13:48.121 --> 13:50.441
They mainly deal in arms,
drugs, and extortion.

13:50.881 --> 13:54.401
Now we can add home invasion and
homicide to their accomplishments.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.161
Yeah, but why these homes?

13:56.441 --> 13:58.481
I mean, how are they picking these victims?

13:59.041 --> 14:00.401
Could they be elaborate hits?

14:00.641 --> 14:02.961
I mean, they have been known
to engage in contract killing.

14:03.161 --> 14:05.601
Are any of these victims
likely to be targets of value?

14:06.121 --> 14:07.377
We haven't received the files yet,

14:07.401 --> 14:10.121
but there doesn't seem to be
anything unusual about these victims.

14:10.521 --> 14:12.121
Up and down the income scale.

14:12.361 --> 14:14.241
I mean, scattered all over the place.

14:14.601 --> 14:15.921
These crimes appear

14:16.241 --> 14:18.841
to be premeditated, but
if there's a pattern,

14:19.721 --> 14:20.761
I don't get it.

14:21.801 --> 14:24.401
Eva, anything about the
white SUV your witness saw?

14:24.601 --> 14:25.601
Not yet, sir.

14:25.761 --> 14:29.881
I'm checking footage from traffic
cameras at intersections nearby.

14:30.481 --> 14:31.481
In Germany as well.

14:31.561 --> 14:33.801
I doubt they'd use the
same SUV for all the crimes.

14:34.321 --> 14:36.921
If it hasn't been dumped
by now, it will be soon.

14:42.121 --> 14:43.121
I'm out!

14:43.161 --> 14:44.161
Silke...

14:44.361 --> 14:46.601
No. No, I'm out.

14:47.121 --> 14:48.121
Okay, let's talk.

14:48.441 --> 14:49.441
Talk?

14:49.481 --> 14:50.841
There's nothing to talk about.

14:51.721 --> 14:53.481
What they did in there, that was just...

14:53.681 --> 14:54.481
It was...

14:54.641 --> 14:57.201
It got out of hand, and Wulf is
sorry about it, aren't you, Wulf?

14:57.441 --> 14:58.441
Sorry for wh...

15:01.001 --> 15:02.561
Yeah. Sorry.

15:03.121 --> 15:04.321
He's not sorry.

15:04.681 --> 15:05.721
He's an animal.

15:05.841 --> 15:07.481
Watch your mouth, bitch.

15:07.681 --> 15:08.761
Bitch?

15:10.081 --> 15:12.201
Are you going to let him
talk to your woman that way?

15:12.401 --> 15:13.481
Are you my woman?

15:15.321 --> 15:16.681
What's that supposed to mean?

15:16.841 --> 15:18.521
Well, "I'm out," doesn't sound like it.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.881
We were only supposed to take stuff.

15:29.681 --> 15:31.441
What they did in there, that was just...

15:33.521 --> 15:34.521
It just...

15:34.641 --> 15:35.641
I'm sorry.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.081
I... I just can't do that again.

15:38.281 --> 15:39.441
Shh... Come here.

15:40.361 --> 15:41.361
Come here.

15:43.081 --> 15:46.041
Drive the SUV out and dump it
and ride back here with Toad.

15:46.601 --> 15:47.601
Mm-hmm.

15:48.601 --> 15:50.161
Okay. Okay.

15:51.041 --> 15:53.361
I just can't do that
again. Please, never again.

15:53.561 --> 15:54.601
You don't have to.

15:55.921 --> 15:56.921
Never again.

16:03.121 --> 16:06.161
There was just a vehicle fire
off the E40 in Walheim, Germany.

16:06.601 --> 16:08.761
White SUV, stripped of
plates and serial numbers.

16:09.481 --> 16:11.441
A woman's body was
recovered from the inside.

16:11.841 --> 16:12.841
Silke Beck.

16:13.561 --> 16:14.561
They killed her?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.097
Looks like they're cleaning up behind them.

16:16.121 --> 16:17.497
They know they've gone too far this time.

16:17.521 --> 16:19.001
Which makes them more dangerous.

16:19.241 --> 16:21.681
Even if it is Silke... and
we need to confirm that...

16:21.881 --> 16:23.841
we cannot wait around on this, Louis.

16:24.121 --> 16:25.681
But we need a real witness.

16:26.481 --> 16:28.721
These are the hard copies
of all the German files.

16:29.441 --> 16:30.801
What do you mean a real witness?

16:31.081 --> 16:33.401
Silke Beck was the only
evidentiary connection.

16:33.681 --> 16:35.241
Everything else is circumstantial.

16:36.001 --> 16:37.921
It's enough to get
authorization to investigate,

16:38.441 --> 16:39.721
but not a conviction.

16:40.641 --> 16:41.841
We need to get on the inside.

16:42.081 --> 16:44.721
An undercover operation?
That could take weeks, months.

16:45.281 --> 16:46.361
We have days.

16:46.961 --> 16:48.761
Well, I can do that. I'm ready for it.

16:49.001 --> 16:51.361
No. Not this case, Eva.

16:51.601 --> 16:53.241
Well, I'm the most qualified person here.

16:53.681 --> 16:55.041
They just lost their female decoy.

16:55.201 --> 16:57.097
If they're going to do another
job, they're going to need a woman.

16:57.121 --> 16:58.561
We just saw how they treat women.

16:58.801 --> 17:01.121
Carl's right. Even if you
survived the initiation,

17:01.521 --> 17:02.761
they will tell you nothing.

17:03.441 --> 17:04.881
- I'll leave you to it.
- Yeah.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.001
What we need is a German male

17:07.521 --> 17:09.201
who knows how to ride a bike.

17:13.840 --> 17:15.281
Oh. Right.

17:16.121 --> 17:17.121
Yeah.

17:17.481 --> 17:19.441
Riding a bike's on my resume.

17:20.601 --> 17:21.601
I know.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.001
No, this is insane.

17:23.401 --> 17:26.521
I'm sorry, but Sebastian has
zero experience in undercover.

17:26.681 --> 17:28.681
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

17:29.841 --> 17:32.201
We don't need him in that
deep, only on the periphery.

17:33.001 --> 17:35.481
You blend in, keep your eyes and ears open,

17:35.761 --> 17:37.761
inform us of their plans. A couple of days,

17:38.441 --> 17:39.441
you're out.

17:40.401 --> 17:41.921
Yeah, I... can do that.

17:42.121 --> 17:43.241
Major, this is crazy.

17:43.441 --> 17:47.201
Eva, Sebastian will need a crash
course in undercover technique.

17:47.561 --> 17:48.561
Understood?

17:49.001 --> 17:50.201
Yes, sir, understood.

17:50.441 --> 17:53.201
Arabela and Carl, help
Dorn build an alias for him.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.081
Your first undercover.

17:57.481 --> 17:58.761
What kind of bike do you ride?

17:59.481 --> 18:01.321
A dirt bike. Once or...

18:03.121 --> 18:04.121
Once.

18:04.761 --> 18:06.881
Come on. Who tells the
whole truth on a resume?

18:13.041 --> 18:14.521
Start by thinking like they think.

18:14.721 --> 18:16.937
They just committed a major
crime, so they're hot right now.

18:16.961 --> 18:17.961
They'll be extra-alert.

18:18.081 --> 18:20.041
You need to make them look
at you not as a threat.

18:20.161 --> 18:20.921
How?

18:21.121 --> 18:23.041
By not being interested
in things a cop would be.

18:23.201 --> 18:25.521
And not trying too hard.
Trying looks suspicious.

18:26.201 --> 18:29.601
I think we need to fabricate
a gang-oriented criminal career

18:29.841 --> 18:31.641
that never quite intersects with Kavalier,

18:31.841 --> 18:33.001
but comes very close.

18:33.201 --> 18:35.801
No, we have excellent people who
can do the documentation for you,

18:35.921 --> 18:36.921
and they're very quick.

18:37.121 --> 18:39.361
I have a good in for
Sebastian. Peter Forst.

18:39.561 --> 18:42.401
I arrested him a few times,
and he's worked for me as a C.I.

18:42.681 --> 18:44.801
His brother was a full
patch Kavalier outlaw

18:45.001 --> 18:47.041
who took the fall for a
murder he did not commit

18:47.561 --> 18:48.841
by order of the gang.

18:49.201 --> 18:52.281
He died in Scheveningen Prison,
and his brother wants payback.

18:52.441 --> 18:53.681
He'll make the introduction.

18:54.121 --> 18:57.441
Your persona will have to be as
much like your real self as possible.

18:57.681 --> 19:00.361
The more you change, the more
you have to keep track of.

19:00.641 --> 19:01.721
For example, your name.

19:01.921 --> 19:04.521
Keep your first name, so you
won't forget how to answer to it.

19:04.721 --> 19:06.161
Sebastian's not a good biker name.

19:06.321 --> 19:08.961
Yeah, I know. How about... Bash?

19:09.561 --> 19:10.561
Bash?

19:10.961 --> 19:13.321
My nickname from middle
school. I know, I know.

19:13.881 --> 19:15.681
- Okay, it's cool.
- It's okay.

19:15.921 --> 19:17.121
- Bash.
- Yeah.

19:17.361 --> 19:19.721
We will say Peter and
Sebastian were cell mates.

19:20.761 --> 19:23.721
Sebastian's story better be
airtight, right back to kindergarten.

19:24.161 --> 19:25.961
These are very dangerous people.

19:26.601 --> 19:28.321
Let me test you whether
you're a cop or not.

19:29.321 --> 19:30.561
Snort this line of coke.

19:32.241 --> 19:34.161
On parole. Gotta piss in a cup tomorrow.

19:35.721 --> 19:37.641
Screw me on the pool
table in front of everyone.

19:37.921 --> 19:39.001
Show me what you got.

19:39.881 --> 19:41.001
What I got is the clap.

19:41.761 --> 19:43.257
If you want to take a chance, let's go.

19:43.281 --> 19:44.897
- Where did you do your time?
- Scheveningen.

19:44.921 --> 19:46.417
I know that place. Which
cell block were you in?

19:46.441 --> 19:48.017
How long were you in for? What color
are the walls in the dining hall...

19:48.041 --> 19:49.161
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down!

19:49.241 --> 19:51.641
No, you don't think! You
either know it, or you're lying.

19:53.441 --> 19:54.441
Yes, come.

19:56.121 --> 19:57.121
Fast work.

19:58.361 --> 20:00.161
Hold on, hold on. This is wrong.

20:02.721 --> 20:03.721
Arabela,

20:04.281 --> 20:06.601
the driver's license was issued
three years ago. He was...

20:06.761 --> 20:08.641
Bash, he would have been
in prison at that time.

20:10.761 --> 20:12.161
Have them make it four years ago,

20:12.361 --> 20:14.081
and make it look like it's four years old!

20:15.441 --> 20:16.761
You have a wire in your jacket.

20:17.121 --> 20:19.161
GPS on your phone 24-7.

20:19.961 --> 20:21.001
We'll have your back.

20:21.241 --> 20:22.401
If it gets bad, just...

20:23.121 --> 20:25.721
give us the signal and we'll be
inside within 60 seconds, okay?

20:25.921 --> 20:26.921
Okay.

20:27.241 --> 20:28.281
Thanks, guys.

20:30.081 --> 20:31.121
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

20:32.881 --> 20:33.881
Right.

21:00.761 --> 21:01.761
Wow.

21:04.761 --> 21:05.761
You look great.

21:07.441 --> 21:08.481
Not too great.

21:08.641 --> 21:09.641
Perfect.

21:12.721 --> 21:13.721
Sebastian...

21:14.801 --> 21:15.801
Be careful.

21:45.041 --> 21:46.081
We're in position.

21:54.681 --> 21:55.681
Bash?

21:55.881 --> 21:57.001
What's up, Peter.

21:57.801 --> 21:58.801
It's been a while.

22:04.168 --> 22:05.168
You ready to do this?

22:05.367 --> 22:06.767
Yeah. Are you?

22:16.767 --> 22:17.767
Private party.

22:18.927 --> 22:20.847
It's cool, Kurt. He's with me.

22:21.487 --> 22:22.727
Max knows he's coming.

22:45.047 --> 22:46.047
Hi, Kaspar.

22:46.847 --> 22:47.847
Two Pils.

22:53.167 --> 22:54.327
Take it easy, man.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.880
You don't know these guys.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.080
I've seen what they do.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.240
Back door's padlocked.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.416
If something happens, we have
to go in through the front,

23:11.440 --> 23:12.976
but there are security cameras everywhere.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.480
I wasn't expecting that in this dump.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.080
Well, they have a lot to worry about.

23:20.760 --> 23:23.480
Oh, and another for my friend Wulf.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.520
Hey, Wulf, this is Bash.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.040
We were cell mates in Holland, together.

23:32.920 --> 23:36.040
If the club is looking for anyone
in the field of computer hacking,

23:36.400 --> 23:38.240
alarms, he's your man.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.640
He's the best.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.880
Is that right?

23:42.080 --> 23:43.600
Oh, yeah, definitely.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.280
We used to talk all the time
about it in Scheveningen.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.800
And I was telling Bash he should
really meet you guys about working...

23:50.960 --> 23:53.240
Why don't you shut your
gob, you stupid little bitch?

23:54.520 --> 23:56.600
If I want to ask for
a job, I'll ask myself.

23:58.800 --> 24:01.440
If you are as good as Peter says you are,

24:01.800 --> 24:03.800
why don't we have you demonstrate?

24:04.480 --> 24:05.520
In the back.

24:06.840 --> 24:07.840
Now.

24:09.680 --> 24:10.880
That ain't part of the script.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.200
Let him go with it.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.840
Just him. Little bitch.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.200
Yeah.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.600
We are not...

24:37.160 --> 24:38.400
Who the hell is this?

24:38.520 --> 24:41.360
This is Bash, a friend of Peter Forst.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.600
Claims he's good with alarms.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.720
I think we're all full up on
tech support, aren't we, Lenz?

24:48.640 --> 24:50.760
I didn't claim anything. I
didn't come here for a job.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.600
I came for a beer. Peter's got a big mouth.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.000
You hack security systems?

24:57.720 --> 24:59.080
Not on parole, I don't.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.000
- Good to meet you.
- Wait.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.680
This is a remote-code cam lock safe.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.560
Can you open that in three minutes?

25:17.880 --> 25:18.880
Two.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.080
Okay, you've got two minutes.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.040
- That's a gun! I'm going in.
- Wait!

25:27.200 --> 25:28.760
Wait. Give it a minute! Wait.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.120
Time it.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.360
Good luck.

25:36.560 --> 25:37.560
And...

25:39.200 --> 25:40.200
go.

25:47.720 --> 25:48.960
It's 15 seconds to the door.

25:49.160 --> 25:51.880
Okay, we have 45 seconds at least
to make a move if he messes up.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.256
- I hope that's enough time.
- It is enough. It is. Calm down.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.480
- What was your name again?
- Bash Kortig.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.360
- Where you from?
- Berlin.

25:59.880 --> 26:00.880
What part?

26:02.200 --> 26:03.320
Hermannplatz.

26:03.720 --> 26:04.720
Excuse me?

26:05.480 --> 26:06.640
Hermannplatz.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.640
Where did you do your time?

26:14.800 --> 26:17.280
- Which stretch?
- 20 seconds.

26:19.720 --> 26:20.880
The house you met Peter in?

26:22.440 --> 26:24.520
- Scheveningen.
- Scheveningen?

26:30.760 --> 26:33.040
Whoa. 10 seconds to spare.

26:34.520 --> 26:36.200
Can I have my damned beer now?

26:48.080 --> 26:49.480
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

26:52.280 --> 26:53.360
That was close.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.160
I heard you like to work old school.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.520
Old dogs, I guess.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.360
It's too perfectly random.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.480
The pattern is no pattern.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.960
There has to be some way that
they're choosing these victims.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.720
Maybe they're just looking for families?

27:11.040 --> 27:13.360
Home invasion number two, a single man.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.080
And small-time burglaries?

27:15.240 --> 27:17.200
These guys are arms
smugglers and drug runners.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.160
They usually only kill other gangs.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.560
So why, all of a sudden,

27:21.880 --> 27:24.080
they're attacking civilians
in their homes, for what?

27:24.280 --> 27:26.280
To steal televisions and necklaces?

27:26.600 --> 27:28.680
It is too much of a change.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.520
Like I said,

27:30.920 --> 27:32.920
it's hard to teach an old dog a new tricks.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.880
You trust him? I don't trust him.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.840
I can smell a cop a mile away,

27:48.720 --> 27:51.000
but we use him on this final job tomorrow,

27:51.520 --> 27:53.640
then he can follow Silke into the grave.

28:37.035 --> 28:38.355
Who the hell is it?

28:38.515 --> 28:40.235
Max has a message for Bash.

28:46.035 --> 28:48.075
Details on a job tonight in Lembeck.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.195
I have the make and model
of alarm system for you.

28:56.275 --> 28:57.955
Securicorp DX12.

28:58.955 --> 28:59.995
No problem.

29:26.275 --> 29:28.355
- Sebastian.
- Major, I have a location.

29:28.995 --> 29:32.075
Lembeck is 42 kilometers above Essen.

29:32.475 --> 29:34.435
Population 5,300.

29:34.675 --> 29:36.475
We can rendezvous with the SWAT team there.

29:36.715 --> 29:38.235
The DX12 is a custom alarm.

29:38.395 --> 29:40.235
There can't be too many
in a town of that size.

29:40.395 --> 29:43.155
If we can narrow it down, this
could be the break we need.

29:44.435 --> 29:45.515
Sebastian, listen to me.

29:45.835 --> 29:48.835
Hang in there and don't worry.
We will be watching your back.

29:48.995 --> 29:49.995
Yes, sir.

30:09.195 --> 30:10.315
They're still there.

30:12.875 --> 30:15.235
I guess we need to find a
way to shake them off tonight.

30:15.515 --> 30:16.875
Create a little diversion.

30:22.915 --> 30:24.715
Got it. Thank you for your help.

30:25.635 --> 30:26.395
What's up?

30:26.515 --> 30:29.995
SecuriCorp have three locations in
Lembeck with that model of alarm.

30:30.155 --> 30:33.155
One is a fitness club, one is
unoccupied, and the other is...

30:33.555 --> 30:35.075
a private residence.

30:37.595 --> 30:39.395
Tommy, we've got the coordinates

30:39.675 --> 30:41.595
of the probable target coming your way.

30:43.835 --> 30:45.595
Go, let's go, let's go. It's all right.

30:45.755 --> 30:47.115
Fast as you can, fast as you can.

30:56.675 --> 30:58.195
Okay, let's get everybody out of here.

31:04.035 --> 31:05.595
What is your problem now?

31:06.955 --> 31:07.995
I don't get it.

31:08.435 --> 31:10.435
If you know he's a cop, why take a chance?

31:10.635 --> 31:11.795
What chance?

31:13.422 --> 31:16.342
We need someone who can get
us through that alarm system,

31:16.942 --> 31:17.942
and Wulf kills him.

31:18.102 --> 31:19.422
But you know he's being tailed.

31:19.742 --> 31:21.102
We are taking care of that.

31:21.462 --> 31:22.902
What if it doesn't work?

31:23.302 --> 31:25.622
Then I guess Wulf is
going to be caught tonight.

31:26.622 --> 31:28.422
Silke was right, he's out of control.

31:29.542 --> 31:31.582
We can take care of everything at once.

32:06.302 --> 32:07.342
They're on the move.

32:23.273 --> 32:25.393
None of the other
victims had alarm systems.

32:25.633 --> 32:27.673
So why a family with one tonight?

32:31.033 --> 32:32.033
Cars.

32:33.393 --> 32:34.393
Cars.

32:35.313 --> 32:37.953
Do you still have those photos,
the... the ones of the tire tracks?

32:41.113 --> 32:42.793
Here. Two sets of tracks.

32:42.953 --> 32:45.593
One for the SUV, the
other for the family car.

32:46.953 --> 32:49.833
Across the street, the neighbors
had a brand new BMW, but...

32:51.993 --> 32:54.033
they steal this family's car.

32:55.513 --> 32:58.193
Why would you steal a
car worth 15,000 Euros

32:58.353 --> 33:00.593
when there's one worth
50 just across the street?

33:00.833 --> 33:02.473
They stole a car at every location.

33:03.753 --> 33:04.753
Stolen.

33:05.913 --> 33:06.913
Stolen.

33:06.993 --> 33:08.513
And they're all the same make.

33:09.593 --> 33:12.913
Every family had the same
make, all brand new cars.

33:13.633 --> 33:15.873
No wonder they didn't steal
the Beemer across the street.

33:15.953 --> 33:17.153
But why this make?

33:17.313 --> 33:19.313
Let's run some serial numbers and find out.

34:23.553 --> 34:24.833
What's happening, Eva?

34:27.553 --> 34:28.993
I can't hear their voices.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.513
You'll get it back when we are done.

35:15.793 --> 35:16.793
That's it.

35:17.953 --> 35:19.473
Give the jacket to Klaus.

35:30.913 --> 35:32.833
Major, I've lost his mobile signal.

35:33.113 --> 35:34.513
Do you have eyes on him?

35:37.433 --> 35:39.153
Yeah, but they all look the same from here.

35:39.353 --> 35:41.633
Do you still have a fix
on the wire in his jacket?

35:42.913 --> 35:43.913
Yes, sir.

36:31.233 --> 36:33.153
I have five of them in the van.

36:33.713 --> 36:36.993
Three of them just took off on
bikes heading east on the 58,

36:37.273 --> 36:38.753
another three back towards Essen,

36:38.953 --> 36:40.193
along with the jacket.

36:51.193 --> 36:52.713
Why did we have to change?

36:53.073 --> 36:54.873
We never wear leathers on the job.

36:55.553 --> 36:56.553
Yeah, I get it,

36:57.073 --> 36:58.793
but why did we split up?

36:59.193 --> 37:00.873
You ask a lot of questions.

37:08.233 --> 37:09.233
Hey!

37:15.393 --> 37:17.833
On the 14th of last month, a car carrier

37:18.113 --> 37:21.593
from the factory in Bratislava was
rolled out, headed for Amsterdam,

37:21.873 --> 37:23.913
but was hijacked just south of Cologne.

37:25.774 --> 37:27.134
About an hour away from Essen.

37:27.294 --> 37:29.654
Three weeks before Kavalier
began its reign of terror.

37:29.974 --> 37:31.174
According to company records,

37:31.374 --> 37:33.894
a second car carrier was
dispatched on the same day,

37:34.054 --> 37:35.174
headed for Cologne.

37:35.334 --> 37:38.654
All seven vehicles stolen from
the victims were on that carrier.

37:40.054 --> 37:41.694
They hijacked the wrong car carrier.

37:42.294 --> 37:43.294
Wait.

37:44.654 --> 37:47.814
Doesn't this gang deal in heroin
that comes out of Bratislava?

37:47.934 --> 37:48.734
Yes.

37:48.814 --> 37:51.254
Well, you can hide a lot of dope
in the doors of a cheap cars.

37:57.614 --> 37:59.294
Sebastian's mobile signal is back.

38:00.734 --> 38:02.014
34 Laurenstrasse.

38:03.774 --> 38:04.774
Oh, no.

38:04.854 --> 38:05.854
What is it?

38:06.574 --> 38:07.774
That's Peter's flat.

38:20.774 --> 38:22.294
Sebastian's cover is blown.

38:25.414 --> 38:26.774
Almost there.

38:28.814 --> 38:30.134
Lembeck already?

38:30.294 --> 38:31.414
Not Lembeck.

38:32.814 --> 38:34.214
The real job.

38:38.199 --> 38:40.119
I think we can find
where he's really going.

38:40.559 --> 38:43.479
The last car was
registered to Gerta Kaufman.

38:43.759 --> 38:44.559
In Lembeck.

38:44.679 --> 38:46.879
No, Alpen, 50 kilometers west.

38:48.079 --> 38:49.119
Are you sure?

38:49.679 --> 38:50.759
Definitely.

38:53.079 --> 38:54.719
Tommy, Eva, listen.

38:54.919 --> 38:56.039
The target is Alpen,

38:56.959 --> 38:58.839
19 Birtenstrasse.

39:00.119 --> 39:01.359
I can be there in 20.

39:47.199 --> 39:50.159
This is just an input device.
I need to disarm the main box.

39:50.639 --> 39:52.519
Okay, then where is it?

39:53.399 --> 39:54.959
Usually with the other utilities.

39:56.799 --> 39:57.799
Let's go.

40:16.799 --> 40:17.799
Here we go.

40:18.839 --> 40:19.919
That one?

40:28.759 --> 40:30.479
They'd be better off with a dog.

40:31.719 --> 40:33.239
I would just cut its throat.

40:42.532 --> 40:44.892
Come on, kill the alarm and open the gate.

40:51.132 --> 40:52.332
30 seconds.

40:53.012 --> 40:54.732
This isn't an Olympic event.

40:58.012 --> 40:59.012
20.

41:00.652 --> 41:02.852
It's not as easy as just
cutting the red wire.

41:06.012 --> 41:07.012
Bingo.

41:43.492 --> 41:44.532
What is this?

41:54.252 --> 41:56.212
You resist, you get hurt.

41:57.412 --> 41:58.652
You take whatever you want.

41:59.332 --> 42:00.332
I know!

42:01.692 --> 42:03.732
Come on. Let's get what we came for.

42:04.532 --> 42:07.052
The alarm has an automatic
alert if it isn't reset in time.

42:07.212 --> 42:08.572
Where are your car keys?

42:08.892 --> 42:09.892
What?

42:09.932 --> 42:10.932
Your car keys!

42:11.012 --> 42:13.612
Downstairs! It's in the
drawer in the kitchen.

42:16.652 --> 42:17.772
Come on, let's go.

42:18.092 --> 42:19.212
Where are you going to?

42:20.492 --> 42:21.932
She told you where the car keys are.

42:22.212 --> 42:23.212
So?

42:23.692 --> 42:24.692
Come on.

42:26.096 --> 42:27.296
Let's have some fun.

42:30.496 --> 42:31.496
Hey...

42:32.216 --> 42:33.256
Tie these two up.

42:33.536 --> 42:35.056
Wrists and ankles this time.

42:35.576 --> 42:36.616
The boy can watch.

42:43.496 --> 42:44.536
Car keys...

42:45.496 --> 42:47.096
Car keys...

42:55.376 --> 42:56.816
We really should get going, man.

42:57.016 --> 42:58.456
That alarm could go off any minute.

42:58.976 --> 42:59.976
Shut up.

43:00.496 --> 43:01.496
Cop.

43:01.696 --> 43:03.176
Cop? What are you talking about?

43:05.776 --> 43:08.736
First, we're gonna have
some fun with that woman,

43:09.096 --> 43:11.776
and then I'll show you how
we have a really good time.

43:11.936 --> 43:13.776
Bring that bitch down.

43:14.096 --> 43:15.656
Here! Down on the floor!

43:16.296 --> 43:18.536
Police! Drop your weapons!

43:19.216 --> 43:20.216
Get on the floor.

43:21.016 --> 43:22.176
Get on the floor!

43:22.376 --> 43:24.176
Maybe you ought to drop yours, lady.

43:24.336 --> 43:25.776
Eva, don't.

43:27.456 --> 43:28.856
You've got three seconds.

43:29.376 --> 43:30.656
They will kill them.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.736
You got that right, Bash.

43:35.016 --> 43:36.016
One!

43:37.056 --> 43:38.056
Two!

43:38.456 --> 43:39.776
- Don't do it, Eva.
- Three!

43:57.216 --> 44:00.256
Sebastian! Sebastian! Sebastian!

44:02.056 --> 44:03.336
You got him, mate. You got him.

44:03.536 --> 44:05.016
He's done. He's done.

44:06.016 --> 44:07.016
Are you okay?

44:08.656 --> 44:09.656
- Okay.
- Okay.

44:09.736 --> 44:10.736
We got them.

44:10.816 --> 44:11.896
You did great, man.

44:12.696 --> 44:13.696
It's over now.

44:21.416 --> 44:22.416
Bingo.

44:22.976 --> 44:23.976
Jesuss

44:25.576 --> 44:26.576
Look at that.

44:31.296 --> 44:33.096
The Essen police just arrested Max,

44:33.616 --> 44:36.096
the biker leader, packing
to make his escape.

44:36.376 --> 44:37.456
Without his drugs?

44:37.696 --> 44:39.456
He probably thought he
still had this coming.

44:40.176 --> 44:41.616
Good job, everyone.

44:42.576 --> 44:43.856
Oh, that was all Sebastian.

44:44.776 --> 44:46.416
Yeah, where is Bash, anyway?

44:46.576 --> 44:47.576
He's on a call.

44:47.896 --> 44:49.296
Do we know who he's talking to?

44:49.936 --> 44:50.936
Don't know.

44:51.656 --> 44:53.216
Must be someone very important, though.

44:53.616 --> 44:56.296
No, I know it's early. Is he awake yet?

44:57.696 --> 44:59.216
Can I just say hello, please?

44:59.816 --> 45:00.816
Thanks.

45:03.656 --> 45:06.096
Hey, Erik? I told you I'd call.

45:06.856 --> 45:07.936
Did you have a good sleep?

45:09.776 --> 45:10.816
That's cool.

45:13.736 --> 45:14.736
All right.

45:16.296 --> 45:17.816
Hey, hey, hey, listen,

45:19.176 --> 45:21.136
I hope to see you really soon, okay?
