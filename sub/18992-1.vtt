01:27.008 --> 01:29.977
OK. Cut it.
Just a couple more.

01:30.044 --> 01:31.136
Five minutes, OK?

01:34.048 --> 01:35.140
What do you think about this?

01:35.216 --> 01:36.945
You take a truck driver
from Florida, right?

01:37.018 --> 01:40.044
Some real redneck,
a real sweat hog kind of guy.

01:40.121 --> 01:41.952
He comes to New York, right?

01:42.023 --> 01:44.355
First time in the big city.

01:44.425 --> 01:47.155
You go to
the meat market down there...

01:47.228 --> 01:48.820
Tribeca, right?

01:48.896 --> 01:50.329
And... it's really bizarre.

01:50.398 --> 01:53.196
What does he do after
he unloads all his stuff?

01:53.267 --> 01:54.894
What's he do with himself?

01:54.969 --> 01:55.993
Where does he go?

01:56.070 --> 01:57.537
Is he looking
to get laid, or what?

01:57.605 --> 01:58.833
What's he do with his money?

01:58.906 --> 02:02.672
And you do a New York angle on a
guy from out of town.

02:04.545 --> 02:06.012
I got another one here.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.139
What about a piece
on Lombardy on Staten Island?

02:08.215 --> 02:11.082
You know, corruption bombs
going off all around this guy.

02:11.152 --> 02:12.380
What is he, Mr. Clean?

02:12.453 --> 02:14.853
You know he's got his hands
where they don't belong.

02:14.922 --> 02:17.186
No, I don't think so, Jon.

02:17.258 --> 02:18.623
OK, last one.

02:20.995 --> 02:22.758
You remember all those
construction cranes...

02:22.830 --> 02:24.297
that kept falling down
a while ago?

02:24.365 --> 02:26.128
There were six people killed
in a couple of months.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.565
I hate cranes.

02:27.635 --> 02:29.125
There was all this talk
from City Hall...

02:29.203 --> 02:30.864
about new inspectors,
tougher standards, and...

02:30.938 --> 02:33.065
Weren't you working
on a service piece?

02:33.140 --> 02:35.108
"Best pork sausage,"
wasn't it?

02:35.176 --> 02:36.108
Yeah, that's right, Ted.

02:36.177 --> 02:37.508
That ran three weeks ago.

02:37.578 --> 02:39.307
I also did a little piece
on frying pans...

02:39.380 --> 02:41.644
aluminum versus cast iron,
a side piece on teflon.

02:41.716 --> 02:45.049
I am trying to write the kind
of pieces that I used to.

02:45.119 --> 02:47.178
Then write
the way you used to.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.619
Thanks a lot.

02:52.093 --> 02:54.425
I'm not so sure about
Freddy's Times Square piece.

02:54.495 --> 02:57.293
I haven't seen a word,
and he's in L.A.

02:57.365 --> 02:59.230
What the hell's he doing
in L. A?

02:59.300 --> 03:00.665
The issue closes Monday.

03:00.735 --> 03:02.396
Probably chasing movie deals.

03:03.571 --> 03:05.562
We're doing this great
Times Square piece...

03:05.639 --> 03:06.901
"After the Cleanup."

03:06.974 --> 03:08.339
If Freddy doesn't deliver...

03:08.409 --> 03:10.741
it'll mean spiking
a page and a half of ads.

03:18.886 --> 03:21.821
I could get you an interview
with a Times Square pimp.

03:21.889 --> 03:23.652
Didn't we do that
a few years back?

03:23.724 --> 03:25.954
No, no. This is a totally
different angle.

03:26.026 --> 03:28.358
This guy is not just
a flesh peddler.

03:28.429 --> 03:30.420
What is he,
a Methodist minister?

03:34.268 --> 03:35.235
Ted.

03:36.370 --> 03:37.359
Excuse me, Ted.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.773
I'm talking about a guy my age
who's swimming in cash.

03:42.843 --> 03:46.074
This guy goes through
ten grand a week like that.

03:46.147 --> 03:47.808
I'm talking about
a lifestyle piece...

03:47.882 --> 03:49.747
"Lifestyle of a Pimp."

03:49.817 --> 03:51.148
How do you know this guy?

03:51.218 --> 03:53.015
I get around.

03:53.087 --> 03:56.784
I'd like to do 24 hours
in the life of a pimp.

03:56.857 --> 03:58.449
You go into his house
and you find out...

03:58.526 --> 04:00.221
what he thinks,
about things in general...

04:00.294 --> 04:01.727
politics, religion,
who's his broker.

04:01.796 --> 04:03.229
I don't know...
not the usual crap...

04:03.297 --> 04:05.857
about his clothes and his girls
and all that stuff.

04:05.933 --> 04:10.495
In 2,000 words, I am going to
look into this man's skull.

04:22.450 --> 04:23.474
Do it.

04:23.551 --> 04:25.246
Great.

04:25.319 --> 04:30.256
But... you have it
on this desk Monday morning.

04:33.227 --> 04:35.161
I'll walk you out.

04:35.229 --> 04:36.753
Remember...

04:36.831 --> 04:38.321
Monday morning.

04:44.972 --> 04:46.667
Hi.

04:46.740 --> 04:48.571
Hey, baby, want a date?

05:00.888 --> 05:03.118
How about that Tyson, man?

05:03.190 --> 05:05.021
You see that boy punch?

05:05.092 --> 05:06.889
He put the lights out
on that chump so fast.

05:06.961 --> 05:09.828
First round...
Bam! Bam-bam!

05:09.897 --> 05:11.865
Mike T! Mike T!

05:11.932 --> 05:13.524
Would you shut the fuck up?

05:26.847 --> 05:28.542
Find out when the dude
is fighting again.

05:29.517 --> 05:30.711
Maybe we'll go see him.

05:35.389 --> 05:37.755
We get uptown, I want you
to drop me by Louise's...

05:37.825 --> 05:41.090
then go to the cleaners and get
my black silk shirt out.

05:41.161 --> 05:42.355
I ain't got no money.

05:55.409 --> 05:57.172
That enough?

05:57.244 --> 06:00.008
Two hundred? Just about.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.945
You keep them shirts dirty, huh?

06:03.217 --> 06:05.412
Just see that you do it.

06:05.486 --> 06:06.851
I got it.

06:08.422 --> 06:10.219
Slow down.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.191
Come on, baby.

06:15.262 --> 06:17.162
He do or he don't.

06:18.866 --> 06:20.697
Make your move, bitch!

06:20.768 --> 06:22.633
The chance of a lifetime.

06:22.703 --> 06:24.330
There you go.

06:29.043 --> 06:30.442
All right, bet.

06:32.846 --> 06:35.474
Swing over by the Del Rio,
see whose tush is snappin'.

06:46.727 --> 06:49.025
Yo, Willie.
What's happening, man?

06:50.230 --> 06:51.595
Something's happening
down there.

06:51.665 --> 06:52.927
Man, they're crazy.

06:53.000 --> 06:53.932
What?

06:54.001 --> 06:55.161
They're crazy!

06:55.235 --> 06:56.702
Shit.

07:01.408 --> 07:03.376
Hey, Reggie!

07:08.549 --> 07:10.039
Come on!

07:10.117 --> 07:12.745
You want it? Are you ready?

07:12.820 --> 07:14.117
Knock that shit off.

07:14.188 --> 07:15.155
You can get
your nub-dick money back.

07:16.023 --> 07:17.490
Hey, come on, lighten up.

07:17.558 --> 07:18.547
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

07:18.626 --> 07:20.253
Come on, Shorty,
what's up with you, man?

07:20.327 --> 07:22.295
What the fuck
do I look like to you?

07:22.363 --> 07:23.728
I'm some sort of jerk-off?

07:23.797 --> 07:25.059
What are you trying
to run past me?

07:26.667 --> 07:27.725
Look, you're right, man.

07:27.801 --> 07:29.564
This bitch is always
doing shit like this.

07:29.637 --> 07:30.626
Where did you get
this bitch from?

07:30.704 --> 07:32.501
I got her in San Juan,
but I'm gonna send her back.

07:32.573 --> 07:34.473
You're sending her back?

07:34.541 --> 07:36.634
What do you take me for?

07:36.710 --> 07:38.234
What are you trying
to run on me here?

07:38.312 --> 07:41.281
All right, man.
Let's be cool, OK?

07:41.348 --> 07:42.645
It's all going to be
all right.

07:42.716 --> 07:44.240
It's going to be cool.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.190
Fuck.

08:18.285 --> 08:20.776
This motherfucker's dead, man!

08:20.854 --> 08:22.549
Oh, shit!

08:23.724 --> 08:26.056
What are we going to do?

08:26.126 --> 08:27.923
Fuck do I know?!

08:27.995 --> 08:30.293
Throw him out the window
for all I care.

09:03.564 --> 09:04.826
How's it going?

09:04.898 --> 09:07.230
Kind of slow
out here tonight, huh?

09:07.301 --> 09:11.032
They send you dudes out here
looking all kind of ways.

09:11.105 --> 09:12.868
There's nothing
out here for you, Jack.

09:12.940 --> 09:15.170
I'd just like to talk to you
for a minute.

09:15.242 --> 09:17.938
Listen, man, you better
haul your ass on out of here...

09:18.011 --> 09:20.707
before I cut your balls off
and shove 'em up your ass.

09:22.850 --> 09:24.147
All right.

09:25.185 --> 09:27.312
It's OK. It's cool.

09:28.789 --> 09:30.188
Want a date?

09:30.257 --> 09:32.725
Tell me what, I got it for you.

09:32.793 --> 09:35.728
It's cool.
I go any which way.

09:35.796 --> 09:37.957
You like it hard and dark?

09:38.031 --> 09:39.293
I don't think so.

09:47.174 --> 09:48.664
Want to go out?

09:52.146 --> 09:53.579
What's the deal?

09:53.647 --> 09:55.114
Sixty.

09:56.884 --> 09:59.045
Are you going to
tell me your name now?

10:02.356 --> 10:03.288
Where do you come from?

10:03.357 --> 10:05.257
Where did you grow up?

10:05.325 --> 10:06.849
You know,
when guys ask questions...

10:06.927 --> 10:08.792
they're either scared
or they're cops.

10:08.862 --> 10:10.090
You're not a cop.

10:10.164 --> 10:11.529
I'm not scared, either.

10:14.201 --> 10:15.463
Actually, I write
for a magazine.

10:15.536 --> 10:18.061
Oh, yeah? I don't read
magazines too much.

10:18.138 --> 10:19.730
No, really, I do.
I'm a reporter.

10:23.677 --> 10:26.237
Excuse me.
You guys have a light?

10:26.313 --> 10:27.803
Thanks.

10:43.697 --> 10:44.994
Listen, tell me something.

10:45.065 --> 10:47.329
You work for anybody
in particular?

10:49.203 --> 10:50.898
Aw, come on.
You don't have a man?

10:52.739 --> 10:55.003
You got to have somebody
who runs protection for you...

10:55.075 --> 10:57.270
lines up the hotel,
buys you clothes, right?

10:58.745 --> 11:00.144
No pimp. Just me.

11:00.214 --> 11:01.613
I don't believe you.

11:01.682 --> 11:03.149
I don't give a shit.

11:03.217 --> 11:05.685
Why is it I can't get anybody
to talk to me out here?

11:07.087 --> 11:09.351
I got to go.

11:15.028 --> 11:17.292
So, this is it?

11:17.364 --> 11:18.831
You want a tip?

11:20.200 --> 11:22.964
For sixty bucks, you could get a
really good time.

11:23.704 --> 11:25.001
I'm sure.

11:26.039 --> 11:28.837
Next time, you ask for Punchy.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.385
It's going great.

11:46.693 --> 11:47.819
I've talked to a few of them.

11:47.895 --> 11:51.422
I haven't narrowed it down
to the perfect guy yet...

11:51.498 --> 11:53.193
but I think
I'm closing in on him.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.065
Right on schedule.

11:59.273 --> 12:01.935
In fact, maybe I'm
a little ahead of schedule.

12:02.009 --> 12:04.569
I'll call you back tomorrow,
tell you more.

12:04.645 --> 12:05.907
Right. Bye, Ben.

12:05.979 --> 12:07.674
This is gonna be a great story.

12:07.748 --> 12:08.874
It's nowhere.

12:08.949 --> 12:11.349
I don't have one usable
piece of information.

12:11.418 --> 12:13.648
I just heard you on the phone
with Ben. You said...

12:13.720 --> 12:15.051
What am I gonna tell him,
I can't do it?

12:16.223 --> 12:18.521
If I had enough time,
I know I could get this story.

12:19.359 --> 12:20.792
What have you got so far?

12:20.861 --> 12:22.556
So far, zip.

12:22.629 --> 12:24.187
I can't get anybody
out there to talk to me.

12:24.264 --> 12:26.892
Come on,
you're a smart guy.

12:26.967 --> 12:28.332
It can't be that difficult.

12:28.402 --> 12:29.960
Why don't you come out
with me tonight?

12:30.037 --> 12:31.470
You'll see what
I'm talking about.

12:31.538 --> 12:32.698
It might be
very interesting.

12:32.773 --> 12:35.105
It'll be nice to have
somebody to talk to.

13:17.617 --> 13:19.812
May I have a scotch
on the rocks, please?

13:23.690 --> 13:25.089
Thank you.

13:29.529 --> 13:31.793
How you doing, babe?

13:31.865 --> 13:35.232
I'm doing fine, thank you.

13:35.302 --> 13:36.929
Just fine.

13:37.971 --> 13:39.268
Split.

13:43.310 --> 13:45.676
You got to look out in here.

13:45.746 --> 13:47.873
Some people might not be OK.

13:47.948 --> 13:50.917
I'm just waiting
for a friend.

13:50.984 --> 13:52.076
Your man?

13:52.152 --> 13:54.245
No, a girlfriend.

13:54.321 --> 13:55.686
Tell you what.

13:55.756 --> 13:57.656
I'll buy you a drink.

13:58.859 --> 14:02.727
We watch the door,
see if she comes in.

14:15.675 --> 14:17.836
I seen a lot of
ladies in here...

14:17.911 --> 14:19.742
but you look nice.

14:27.254 --> 14:29.814
You could make
a lot of money.

14:29.890 --> 14:31.289
Would you like that?

14:32.325 --> 14:33.257
Sure.

14:33.326 --> 14:36.227
You call me Solo...

14:36.296 --> 14:39.390
because I'm the only one...

14:39.466 --> 14:40.933
you ever gonna need.

14:42.135 --> 14:45.935
You want that,
don't you, girl?

14:48.041 --> 14:49.133
I don't know.

14:50.477 --> 14:52.138
Don't answer like that.

14:53.313 --> 14:55.406
Don't lie to Solo.

14:55.482 --> 15:00.317
Tell me you want
to make men crawl...

15:01.788 --> 15:04.256
lick your shoes,
and pay for more.

15:04.324 --> 15:05.916
Torture a man.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.459
Just look at him
and drive him...

15:07.527 --> 15:09.119
Excuse me.

15:09.196 --> 15:12.597
You don't go nowhere till I say
so, you understand, bitch?

15:12.666 --> 15:14.463
All right. Up! Up!

15:14.534 --> 15:16.365
What's your problem?

15:16.436 --> 15:17.596
Out of the way.

15:17.671 --> 15:19.036
You can't bust me.

15:20.373 --> 15:23.740
I don't want to hear it.
I'm tired of your shit.

15:23.810 --> 15:26.711
Oh, God.
He was just so awful.

15:27.948 --> 15:29.575
That's all right.

15:31.551 --> 15:32.745
You OK?

15:34.454 --> 15:35.921
It just scared me.

15:37.124 --> 15:38.716
I'm a moron.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.350
I don't know why
I let you do that.

15:43.296 --> 15:44.558
Just hold me.

15:44.631 --> 15:45.655
I got you.

15:46.967 --> 15:48.491
How about if
I run you a hot bath?

15:57.144 --> 15:58.736
I love you.

16:10.991 --> 16:11.923
You might want to have
second thoughts...

16:11.992 --> 16:13.050
about this story.

16:14.661 --> 16:16.253
This thing is too dangerous.

16:16.329 --> 16:18.058
I can't quit.

16:18.131 --> 16:19.496
But you saw those people
tonight.

16:19.566 --> 16:21.431
That guy could have killed me.

16:21.501 --> 16:23.560
I know that, and I'm sorry.

16:34.481 --> 16:35.948
I'm going to stay up
and work for a while.

17:25.432 --> 17:26.898
Morning.

17:28.768 --> 17:30.565
This is fantastic.

17:30.637 --> 17:32.901
Yeah? Think it's good?

17:34.274 --> 17:36.834
Where did you
get all this stuff?

17:36.910 --> 17:38.343
Easy.

17:38.411 --> 17:40.276
You made it up?

17:41.314 --> 17:43.145
That doesn't sound like you.

17:43.216 --> 17:45.946
It was either that
or find a new job.

17:46.019 --> 17:47.543
Jonathan, this is
really terrific.

17:47.621 --> 17:49.111
You think he'll run it?

17:49.189 --> 17:50.417
You're damn right he will.

17:50.490 --> 17:53.391
I'll bet you he says
he's gonna make you a star.

17:53.460 --> 17:56.190
It's wonderful! Listen...

17:56.263 --> 17:57.890
Listen to this.

17:57.964 --> 18:00.228
"Although he doesn't vote
and never has...

18:00.300 --> 18:03.098
"Tyrone has no modesty about
his own political potential.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.729
"'lf I was the President,'
he says,

18:05.805 --> 18:07.773
"'I could fix the world
in 30 seconds.

18:07.841 --> 18:08.933
"'I'd send everybody pussy...

18:09.009 --> 18:10.738
"'then they don't have
no time for trouble."'

18:13.647 --> 18:16.172
It's terrific.
It's first-rate.

18:16.249 --> 18:17.511
It's a real breakthrough.

18:17.584 --> 18:19.950
Better change "pussy"
to something else.

18:20.020 --> 18:21.851
We got any art, photos?

18:21.921 --> 18:23.286
That's a big problem.

18:23.356 --> 18:24.948
Ted, these guys don't
do photo sessions.

18:25.959 --> 18:28.450
So we'll go with drawings,
then. Why not?

18:28.528 --> 18:30.086
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

18:30.163 --> 18:31.425
I don't know about this.

18:31.498 --> 18:32.760
I should explain something.

18:32.832 --> 18:34.265
You've got him working
an awful lot.

18:34.334 --> 18:35.596
I hear these guys
sleep till noon.

18:35.669 --> 18:37.603
You want me to change
how late he sleeps?

18:37.671 --> 18:39.434
That would be good.
Wonderful.

18:39.506 --> 18:40.598
What are you working on now?

18:40.674 --> 18:42.938
You remember the piece about
the construction cranes?

18:43.009 --> 18:44.533
Cranes! I love cranes!

18:44.611 --> 18:47.011
That's a great idea. Do it!

18:47.080 --> 18:49.139
Get him a researcher.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.275
The seriousness of the charge
speaks for itself, Your Honor...

18:52.352 --> 18:54.786
and in light of Mr. Smalls'
previous record...

18:54.854 --> 18:57.220
the People ask that
no bail be granted.

18:57.290 --> 19:00.453
Your Honor, Mr. Smalls
is a native of this city...

19:00.527 --> 19:02.461
well known in the community.

19:02.529 --> 19:04.463
He's never had a conviction.

19:04.531 --> 19:07.989
We request that he be released
on his own recognizance.

19:14.474 --> 19:17.910
Bail is set at $250,000.

19:17.977 --> 19:20.241
Mr. Smalls can make bail.

19:24.984 --> 19:26.212
Mr. Pike?

19:27.987 --> 19:29.511
May I call you Leonard?

19:29.589 --> 19:33.150
I'd like to suggest
a way out of this...

19:33.226 --> 19:35.592
that's advantageous
all around.

19:35.662 --> 19:38.187
I suppose you want to plead
to purse snatching.

19:38.264 --> 19:41.131
The man had
a heart attack, Mr. Pike.

19:42.402 --> 19:44.996
Your client has
a rap sheet a mile long.

19:45.071 --> 19:47.164
He kicked a man's face in.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.502
That was
involuntary manslaughter.

19:48.575 --> 19:49.803
He's a menace!

19:49.876 --> 19:53.175
The People are going to ask
for murder two.

19:53.246 --> 19:56.238
Look, you and I can
settle this right now...

19:56.316 --> 19:58.682
Murder two.

19:58.752 --> 20:00.845
Involuntary manslaughter
carries time.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.979
I'm sure that reasonable men...

20:03.056 --> 20:04.353
can find
an accommodation here.

20:04.424 --> 20:05.914
I'll see you in court.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.033
Fucking asshole.

20:15.101 --> 20:16.568
Yeah, I know.

20:48.535 --> 20:49.502
Hi, honey.

20:49.569 --> 20:51.730
Hi, Jay.

20:51.805 --> 20:53.568
Oh, my God.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.732
Congratulations.

20:54.808 --> 20:56.742
I look forward to reading it.

20:56.810 --> 20:58.471
Thanks. It comes out
on Monday.

21:03.817 --> 21:05.751
I'll take
my coffee break now...

21:05.819 --> 21:07.411
and we can do
those elevator specs later.

21:07.487 --> 21:09.614
Thanks, Jay. Appreciate it.

21:09.689 --> 21:10.656
See you later.

21:13.693 --> 21:16.685
I see he's still trying
to grab your ass.

21:16.763 --> 21:18.560
The man's harmless, Jonathan.

21:18.631 --> 21:19.620
Right.

21:21.468 --> 21:22.833
It's pretty wild.

21:22.902 --> 21:24.699
I had no idea it would be
the cover, believe me.

21:26.940 --> 21:29.408
How do you feel about this?

21:34.781 --> 21:38.376
Well... I'm amazed
I got away with it.

21:40.053 --> 21:42.214
I'm also ashamed
that I got away with it.

21:42.889 --> 21:45.414
What the hell,
back in business, right?

21:46.793 --> 21:48.055
I like this place.

21:48.962 --> 21:50.725
I love this place.

21:54.133 --> 21:56.727
You just remain
charming and beautiful.

21:56.803 --> 21:59.567
You absolutely
have to try the...

21:59.639 --> 22:01.231
[names French menu item]

22:01.307 --> 22:02.239
It's unbelievable.

22:02.308 --> 22:04.742
I wouldn't dream
of skipping it.

22:04.811 --> 22:06.244
Actually, I was wondering
if we could have...

22:06.312 --> 22:07.745
some more of those
little green things?

22:07.814 --> 22:09.247
Hey, Teddy!

22:09.315 --> 22:11.943
Marty! I want to introduce you
to Jonathan Fisher.

22:12.018 --> 22:13.007
He did the cover this week.

22:13.086 --> 22:15.850
Oh, right. "Tyrone:
Sheik of the Streets."

22:15.922 --> 22:17.856
- Good story.
- Thank you.

22:17.924 --> 22:20.893
The pimp story?
I'm Yvonne Saunders.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.860
I know.
I see you on the news.

22:22.929 --> 22:24.453
It had real authenticity.

22:24.531 --> 22:27.295
Do they really have
those condos in Hawaii?

22:27.367 --> 22:28.925
I don't know
about all of them...

22:29.002 --> 22:30.936
but this guy does.

22:31.004 --> 22:32.369
You really got the street.

22:32.438 --> 22:33.427
That thing breathes.

22:33.506 --> 22:35.133
You know anything
about TV news?

22:35.208 --> 22:38.507
It goes on at 6:00 and 11:00.

22:39.712 --> 22:41.577
Other than that...

22:44.617 --> 22:46.710
Yeah, I go on
at 6:00 and 11:00.

22:46.786 --> 22:50.381
You don't look the way
I thought you would.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.686
How do you know so much
about this stuff?

22:52.759 --> 22:55.728
Well, you know,
I'm a reporter.

22:55.795 --> 22:57.922
Marty, I think
your table's ready.

22:57.997 --> 22:59.396
We've eaten, Teddy.

22:59.465 --> 23:00.898
Why don't you come over
to the station...

23:00.967 --> 23:02.901
we'll run a tape on you,
make you a star.

23:02.969 --> 23:05.563
He's already a star.
He's my star.

23:05.638 --> 23:06.570
I forgot.

23:06.639 --> 23:07.833
Why don't you just
make him an anchor?

23:07.907 --> 23:08.874
Might do that, too.

23:10.743 --> 23:11.835
Nice to meet you.

23:13.079 --> 23:14.376
Call me.

23:17.083 --> 23:19.847
Jonathan,
do you believe this?

23:19.919 --> 23:22.183
I'm the flavor
of the week.

23:22.255 --> 23:23.620
Since it's my week,
let's enjoy it.

23:23.690 --> 23:26.523
Are you kids
having a good time?

23:26.593 --> 23:28.026
We're barely managing.

23:28.094 --> 23:29.288
We could do with some more
of the green things.

23:29.362 --> 23:32.024
Waiter!
Some more green things.

23:32.098 --> 23:33.190
You know, Jonathan...

23:33.266 --> 23:35.530
I would really like
to do more with Tyrone.

23:35.602 --> 23:37.866
He is
a great New York character.

23:37.937 --> 23:39.529
I think that's
about it for Tyrone.

23:39.606 --> 23:41.039
That's a terrific story.

23:41.107 --> 23:43.166
I really think it's a wrap.

23:43.242 --> 23:45.369
Jon, I'd really like
to meet him.

23:47.113 --> 23:48.808
To Tyrone.

23:54.454 --> 23:56.422
To you, Jonathan.

23:59.626 --> 24:00.923
Jonathan Fisher?

24:01.694 --> 24:04.094
Leonard Pike,
Assistant District Attorney.

24:05.632 --> 24:07.224
Come on in, OK?
Shut the door.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.597
Be right with you.

24:14.107 --> 24:15.506
Marty, hi.
What did you think?

24:15.575 --> 24:17.008
Great.

24:17.076 --> 24:18.509
You did?

24:18.578 --> 24:20.512
That's fantastic. Thank you.

24:20.580 --> 24:22.013
Thanks a lot.

24:22.081 --> 24:25.517
I was thinking, what if we
call it "Street Smart"?

24:25.585 --> 24:27.177
You know, once
you're out on the street...

24:27.253 --> 24:28.652
you never know
what you're gonna run into.

24:29.656 --> 24:31.521
It's gonna be real exciting,
I promise you.

24:34.193 --> 24:35.387
10:30 at the office?

24:36.562 --> 24:38.029
I'll see you then.

24:43.903 --> 24:45.894
I see you went to Harvard.

24:45.972 --> 24:47.530
Is this going to be
an alumni meeting?

24:47.607 --> 24:48.699
I didn't.

24:48.775 --> 24:50.709
It's OK. You didn't
miss too much.

24:50.777 --> 24:52.711
Have a seat.
You want some coffee?

24:52.779 --> 24:54.212
No, thank you.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.542
What's up?

24:55.615 --> 24:57.879
Has Tyrone read your story yet?

24:59.952 --> 25:01.385
I don't know.

25:01.454 --> 25:02.682
I guess you have.

25:02.755 --> 25:04.382
How did Tyrone like it?

25:06.893 --> 25:09.191
Do I need a lawyer
here, Mr. Pike?

25:09.262 --> 25:12.493
Everyone does
from time to time.

25:12.565 --> 25:13.793
What do you want?

25:13.866 --> 25:16.266
The District Attorney and I
have reason to doubt...

25:16.335 --> 25:19.736
that the subject of your story
is actually named Tyrone.

25:19.806 --> 25:20.932
You're the thought police.

25:21.007 --> 25:22.099
You're going to arrest me
for getting a name wrong.

25:22.175 --> 25:24.507
You're very clever,
Mr. Fisher.

25:24.577 --> 25:27.546
Murder is a pretty serious
crime, wouldn't you say?

25:27.613 --> 25:30.138
There's nothing in that story
about a murder.

25:30.216 --> 25:31.444
No, not a murder.
A murderer.

25:31.517 --> 25:34.350
As in killer
under indictment.

25:34.420 --> 25:35.580
You and I both know...

25:35.655 --> 25:38.522
that the subject of this story
is actually one Leo Smalls...

25:38.591 --> 25:40.058
also known as "Fast Black."

25:40.126 --> 25:42.560
No, I'm sorry, I don't know
who that is.

25:42.628 --> 25:46.120
Don't jerk me around,
and don't protect a killer.

25:46.199 --> 25:47.689
Just wait a minute.
That is a feature story.

25:47.767 --> 25:50.133
You think that your pimp's
the only guy in town?

25:50.203 --> 25:51.363
I want all
the information you have...

25:51.437 --> 25:52.495
and I want to know
how you got it.

25:52.572 --> 25:55.063
Whatever information I have
is right there in that article.

25:55.141 --> 25:56.733
Don't give me that crap.

25:56.809 --> 25:58.037
That might work
with the magazine.

25:58.111 --> 25:59.976
I am prosecuting
a killer, Mr. Fisher.

26:00.046 --> 26:01.070
That is a very real undertaking.

26:01.147 --> 26:03.411
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

26:03.483 --> 26:05.974
You think a guy like this
only kills once?

26:06.052 --> 26:07.246
Why don't you go out
and buy him a gun?

26:07.320 --> 26:09.254
Would you just wait
a minute? Just stop.

26:09.322 --> 26:11.051
We seem to be having
a terrible misunderstanding.

26:11.124 --> 26:13.888
I don't have anything to do
with murder or murderers.

26:13.960 --> 26:15.427
I don't think
you pulled a trigger...

26:15.495 --> 26:18.328
but you're exploiting it,
and that's just as bad.

26:18.397 --> 26:20.524
You think because you changed
the make of his car...

26:20.600 --> 26:22.295
and you changed chocolate soda
into apple juice...

26:22.368 --> 26:23.426
it makes him
a different person?

26:23.503 --> 26:25.232
And this restaurant
you go on about...

26:25.304 --> 26:27.465
is clearly Louise's
up in Harlem.

26:27.540 --> 26:31.340
Look, Mr., uh, Pike,
right?

26:31.410 --> 26:32.843
First of all, I don't know...

26:32.912 --> 26:34.345
what the hell
you're talking about.

26:34.413 --> 26:36.040
Second of all,
I would never do anything...

26:36.115 --> 26:37.548
to impede
a criminal investigation.

26:37.617 --> 26:39.448
Have you got that?
It was nice to meet you.

26:39.519 --> 26:40.543
All right, look.

26:40.620 --> 26:44.021
I just don't want a jury
thinking this guy's glamorous.

26:44.090 --> 26:46.923
I have a good case, yes,
but it's not airtight.

26:47.627 --> 26:49.288
Don't get in the way.

26:54.200 --> 26:57.135
God damn, Joel, what the hell
you talking about, man?

26:57.203 --> 26:58.670
This ain't me.

27:01.707 --> 27:02.696
That's you.

27:02.775 --> 27:05.437
Put some more sauce
on them ribs.

27:05.511 --> 27:07.979
Tyrone is you.

27:08.047 --> 27:09.480
That ain't me.

27:09.549 --> 27:11.608
And don't be using that
lawyer tone with me.

27:12.385 --> 27:13.409
I pay you.

27:13.486 --> 27:15.920
I can stop paying you.

27:15.988 --> 27:17.649
I'm the one that was
up there being arraigned...

27:17.723 --> 27:18.849
while you was
pulling your dong...

27:18.925 --> 27:21.826
so don't use that
schoolhouse tone with me.

27:21.894 --> 27:23.828
You ever talk to anybody
from this magazine?

27:23.896 --> 27:26.660
Yeah, Joel, I go on
"Meet the Press" once a week.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.256
You ever talk to
any reporters?

27:28.334 --> 27:30.199
He don't talk to nobody
below 110th Street.

27:30.269 --> 27:31.327
No dealings whatsoever?

27:31.404 --> 27:32.837
Look, if you don't
get to the point...

27:32.905 --> 27:35.430
I'm gonna stuff those ribs
up your useless butt!

27:35.508 --> 27:38.170
You are looking
at 15 years in the joint...

27:38.244 --> 27:39.836
very possibly 25.

27:39.912 --> 27:41.971
That makes you a pretty
shitty lawyer, don't it?

27:47.353 --> 27:50.254
I'm gonna subpoena
this guy's notes.

27:50.323 --> 27:52.188
So?

27:52.258 --> 27:53.850
He'll refuse to give them up.

27:53.926 --> 27:55.518
I can bet on that.

27:55.595 --> 27:57.859
We'll say that his notes
will exonerate you.

27:57.930 --> 27:59.727
So what? Who cares
if he gives them up?

27:59.799 --> 28:00.993
That's not about me.
This ain't me.

28:01.067 --> 28:03.831
The reporter will be
the guy on trial, not you.

28:03.903 --> 28:07.202
And the heart attack will
confuse the jury all the more.

28:07.273 --> 28:08.740
You're not making
any sense here.

28:08.808 --> 28:11.606
It'll throw doubt and confusion
on your trial...

28:11.677 --> 28:13.167
and right now,
doubt and confusion...

28:13.246 --> 28:14.804
are the best friends you got.

28:14.881 --> 28:16.143
If we play this right...

28:16.215 --> 28:17.648
we can change this
from a murder trial...

28:17.717 --> 28:20.311
to a constitutional
confrontation.

28:20.386 --> 28:21.853
I know this guy.

28:23.422 --> 28:24.650
What?

28:24.724 --> 28:27.750
I know the guy
who wrote this article.

28:27.827 --> 28:29.260
Look at you.

28:29.328 --> 28:32.354
You got sauce
dripping all down you.

28:32.431 --> 28:33.989
New Yorkers don't
usually agree on much...

28:34.066 --> 28:35.829
and certainly not
on the social...

28:35.902 --> 28:37.836
or aesthetic value
of graffiti...

28:37.904 --> 28:38.996
but they can agree
on one thing:

28:39.071 --> 28:40.197
today, it's everywhere.

28:40.273 --> 28:42.104
They're gonna cut to me now.

28:42.174 --> 28:43.334
This is Pablo.

28:43.409 --> 28:46.173
If you get around the city,
you've probably seen his name.

28:46.245 --> 28:47.678
Psychologists say
it's an attempt...

28:47.747 --> 28:49.180
to establish an identity.

28:49.248 --> 28:51.182
Is that what
you're doing, Pablo...

28:51.250 --> 28:52.842
trying to sell your name
to the world?

28:52.919 --> 28:54.284
Nope.

28:54.353 --> 28:57.789
Somebody's been writing
your name on a lot of walls.

28:57.857 --> 28:59.722
Some other kids.

28:59.792 --> 29:00.724
He's funny.

29:00.793 --> 29:02.226
He was tough.

29:02.295 --> 29:04.229
They don't do it right,
all sloppy.

29:04.297 --> 29:06.265
Like, got to have
big letters puffed out...

29:06.332 --> 29:07.697
and good colors, all even.

29:08.734 --> 29:09.792
What do you think
you'd be doing...

29:09.869 --> 29:11.166
if you weren't
writing on walls?

29:11.237 --> 29:14.331
I don't know,
but I'm famous all over.

29:14.407 --> 29:17.171
Pablo 177. People know.

29:17.243 --> 29:19.074
Graffiti's
an eyesore to many...

29:19.145 --> 29:21.613
but to Pablo,
perhaps it's a lifeline.

29:21.681 --> 29:23.148
In his case...

29:23.215 --> 29:25.649
the spray can may have
taken the place of a knife.

29:25.718 --> 29:28.744
This is Jonathan Fisher,
Channel 3, "Street Smart."

29:28.821 --> 29:31.585
- That's him.
- There he is.

29:31.657 --> 29:33.818
Jonathan, are you going to
give up your notes?

29:33.893 --> 29:36.828
How far are you
going to take them?

29:36.896 --> 29:38.227
Why did you
write the story?

29:43.002 --> 29:44.867
I don't want this
to get messy.

29:47.506 --> 29:48.598
How good to see you.

29:48.674 --> 29:49.834
What's going on?

29:49.909 --> 29:52.343
Jon, this is Art Sheffield,
our attorney.

29:52.411 --> 29:53.503
"Our" attorney?

29:53.579 --> 29:54.841
Take a seat.

29:54.914 --> 29:56.609
Make yourself at home.

29:56.682 --> 29:57.808
I enjoy your work.

29:59.685 --> 30:01.949
I seem to be news
down there in the lobby.

30:02.021 --> 30:04.854
Mr. Leo Smalls, Jr.
and his attorney...

30:04.924 --> 30:06.858
have asked the court
to subpoena your notes.

30:06.926 --> 30:09.622
They're claiming in effect
that Mr. Smalls is Tyrone...

30:09.695 --> 30:12.357
and that you have knowledge
that is exculpatory.

30:12.431 --> 30:13.693
Oh, Jesus.

30:13.766 --> 30:15.461
You don't work
for the defense...

30:15.534 --> 30:17.468
and you don't work
for the prosecution.

30:17.536 --> 30:19.868
You work
for this magazine, and we...

30:19.939 --> 30:21.634
Ted, if you don't mind.

30:23.442 --> 30:25.637
Are they going to get
this subpoena?

30:25.711 --> 30:27.770
Absolutely no calls.

30:27.847 --> 30:29.144
New York has a shield law
that protects reporters...

30:29.215 --> 30:30.978
but there are holes in it.

30:31.050 --> 30:32.677
Mr. Smalls' attorney
is very good at exploiting...

30:32.752 --> 30:34.652
this sort of thing.

30:34.720 --> 30:35.652
Sell a thousand.

30:35.721 --> 30:36.847
What would happen
if I said no?

30:36.922 --> 30:39.516
If you refuse to comply
with the subpoena?

30:39.592 --> 30:42.026
I'd say you'd be
in contempt of court.

30:42.094 --> 30:44.221
The First Amendment
protects you.

30:44.296 --> 30:46.730
But the Sixth Amendment
protects Mr. Smalls.

30:46.799 --> 30:49.563
Can I go to jail for this?

30:49.635 --> 30:52.900
You just think of some of the
great prisoners of conscience.

30:52.972 --> 30:54.837
Martin Luther King,
Gandhi...

30:54.907 --> 30:56.204
I'm going to jail.

30:56.275 --> 30:58.266
Is he going to jail?

30:59.979 --> 31:01.412
Thanks a lot, Joe.
It's great.

31:01.480 --> 31:04.176
Just have to see if the station
will OK the money.

31:04.250 --> 31:05.342
I'll call you.

31:05.418 --> 31:07.215
See you later.

32:12.685 --> 32:14.346
Hey, Willie, how you doing?

32:14.420 --> 32:15.887
Same as yesterday.

32:19.425 --> 32:20.551
Thanks.

32:22.428 --> 32:24.487
Come on.

32:37.209 --> 32:39.769
So what are you so depressed
about tonight, anyway?

32:41.280 --> 32:42.645
I don't know.

32:42.715 --> 32:44.808
I just don't want to
go home for a while.

32:46.685 --> 32:47.652
Stick around.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.517
I might do that.

32:52.458 --> 32:54.221
How long
you been doing this?

33:00.032 --> 33:01.329
I want to know.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.834
I mean, I want to know
what it's like to be you.

33:05.771 --> 33:06.829
You do?

33:12.011 --> 33:13.979
I've been doing it a long time.

33:14.046 --> 33:16.708
Did you ever do anything else
before?

33:17.716 --> 33:19.513
Yeah, sure.

33:19.585 --> 33:21.780
I was a beautician...

33:21.854 --> 33:25.620
in this little town
in Pennsylvania where I grew up.

33:25.691 --> 33:27.522
I went to Boston.

33:27.593 --> 33:30.027
Oh, really? I did time there.

33:30.095 --> 33:31.562
Four years at Harvard.

33:33.098 --> 33:34.497
You went to Harvard?

33:39.104 --> 33:41.038
So I ran into this guy...

33:41.106 --> 33:43.097
who told me I could
make a lot more money.

33:43.175 --> 33:45.200
And I do, you know.

33:45.277 --> 33:47.905
I make a lot more money
than being a beautician.

33:47.980 --> 33:49.538
I'll bet.

33:49.615 --> 33:50.912
That's right.

33:52.885 --> 33:55.547
The guys who come in here...

33:55.621 --> 33:57.555
what do you think
they're looking for?

33:57.623 --> 33:59.113
The Holland Tunnel.

33:59.191 --> 34:00.818
I know they want
to get laid...

34:00.893 --> 34:02.827
but do you ever get
really weird stuff?

34:02.895 --> 34:04.556
Oh, yeah.

34:04.630 --> 34:06.564
What's the weirdest thing
a guy ever asked you to do?

34:06.632 --> 34:07.860
Talk.

34:10.135 --> 34:13.002
Do you remember
what it was like...

34:13.072 --> 34:14.902
your first time working?

34:14.974 --> 34:16.998
You don't want to know
about the first time.

34:17.076 --> 34:18.509
It sounds like I do.

34:18.577 --> 34:19.839
I don't think you do.

34:19.911 --> 34:21.743
You're funny, aren't you?

34:23.581 --> 34:25.277
I'm young, you know?

34:25.351 --> 34:27.683
I'm just off the bus
from Boston.

34:29.255 --> 34:30.688
So, my friend, he says...

34:30.755 --> 34:33.020
He says there's this guy
upstairs...

34:33.092 --> 34:36.027
in the hotel
waiting for me... this trick.

34:36.094 --> 34:39.030
I go up, and I see this guy.

34:39.098 --> 34:40.793
He's just sitting,
straight up in bed.

34:40.866 --> 34:41.958
Just sitting there.

34:42.034 --> 34:43.058
Come here. I'll show you.

34:46.105 --> 34:48.039
Sit down. Just sit there.

34:48.107 --> 34:52.043
Put your legs
out in front of you

34:52.110 --> 34:53.635
and cover them.

34:57.616 --> 35:00.551
It turns out later
he's this Russian sailor.

35:00.619 --> 35:03.554
His buddies brought him
in the bedroom...

35:03.622 --> 35:05.055
and left him waiting.

35:05.124 --> 35:07.592
So I went over to him.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.992
The guy's got
two broken legs!

35:18.070 --> 35:19.503
Can you imagine?

35:19.571 --> 35:21.004
He's got casts
right up to there.

35:24.576 --> 35:26.009
Shit.

35:26.078 --> 35:29.047
So what did you do about that?

35:30.582 --> 35:33.210
What could I do, really?

35:36.088 --> 35:39.023
I did what I could do.

35:39.091 --> 35:40.581
Wait. I forgot to tell you.

35:40.659 --> 35:43.093
He had a bad back, too.

35:43.162 --> 35:45.392
He couldn't sit up
for very long.

35:58.610 --> 35:59.941
What did you do,
give him a freebie?

36:00.012 --> 36:02.537
Oh, I forgot.
That's the best part.

36:02.614 --> 36:03.911
Give me your wallet.

36:11.123 --> 36:12.647
Let's see.

36:19.565 --> 36:22.500
So I say to the guy,
"I get paid before the action.

36:22.568 --> 36:24.297
"You know what I mean?"
Let's go.

36:24.370 --> 36:26.031
And he goes,
"Ra ra ra ra ra!"

36:26.105 --> 36:28.039
I said, "No joke.

36:28.107 --> 36:29.438
"I get paid
before the action."

36:29.508 --> 36:31.135
You know,
ra ra ra ra ra!

37:33.906 --> 37:34.998
Do it.

37:35.073 --> 37:36.506
Yeah, right.

37:36.575 --> 37:38.509
Take him every place you go.

37:38.577 --> 37:39.509
Public places.

37:39.578 --> 37:40.772
Make him an expert on you.

37:40.846 --> 37:41.938
I want everybody to know...

37:42.014 --> 37:44.005
he wrote that story
about you.

37:44.082 --> 37:46.016
This ain't going to work.

37:46.084 --> 37:48.018
Just more lawyer bullshit.

37:48.086 --> 37:49.781
Just do it.

37:49.855 --> 37:51.618
The girls who work
these Midtown streets...

37:51.690 --> 37:54.124
have learned to take just
about everything in stride.

37:54.193 --> 37:56.457
Moving in and out
of cheap hotel rooms...

37:56.528 --> 37:58.792
they do not discriminate
among their clientele.

37:58.864 --> 38:01.833
One young woman gave an account
of her personal efforts...

38:01.900 --> 38:03.959
to ease Soviet-American
tensions.

38:04.036 --> 38:05.264
In an exclusive interview...

38:05.337 --> 38:08.238
she referred to her graceless,
dilapidated walls...

38:08.307 --> 38:09.797
as "Home, sweet home."

38:09.875 --> 38:11.740
And maybe for her, it is.

38:11.810 --> 38:14.472
This is Jonathan Fisher,
Channel 3, "Street Smart."

38:14.546 --> 38:16.673
OK, that going to cut
with the "B" roll?

38:16.748 --> 38:17.680
That'll be good.

38:17.749 --> 38:18.738
Thanks a lot, guys.

38:18.817 --> 38:20.842
I'll see you
on the next one.

38:20.919 --> 38:23.410
Soviet-American relations?

38:23.489 --> 38:24.513
Hi there.

38:24.590 --> 38:26.023
That was great.
I liked that.

38:26.091 --> 38:27.456
You liked that, huh?

38:30.162 --> 38:31.288
I got to get back
to the station.

38:31.363 --> 38:33.194
Listen, a friend of mine
wants to meet you.

38:34.333 --> 38:36.631
He read your magazine.
I told him I knew you.

38:36.702 --> 38:37.828
Your pimp?

38:37.903 --> 38:39.837
If you call him that,
he's gonna kill you.

38:39.905 --> 38:40.997
You watch out.

38:41.073 --> 38:42.506
You're a tough woman, Punchy.

38:42.574 --> 38:44.166
Big surprise.

38:44.243 --> 38:46.438
Want to know something?
I really like you.

38:46.512 --> 38:48.673
Meaning you finally
got laid enough...

38:48.747 --> 38:50.180
to curl your hair.

38:50.249 --> 38:51.614
Where is that girlfriend
of yours, anyway?

38:51.683 --> 38:53.275
What's she do for you?

38:53.352 --> 38:54.683
We've got a different
kind of relationship.

38:54.753 --> 38:56.186
Pussy isn't any good, huh?

38:56.255 --> 38:58.052
It's kind of a question
of applied ethics.

38:58.123 --> 38:59.181
We'll work it out.

38:59.258 --> 39:01.351
I love when you talk
that Harvard shit.

39:01.426 --> 39:02.950
I knew it would come in
handy for something.

39:03.028 --> 39:05.496
Taxi!

39:13.071 --> 39:15.164
Show business.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.332
How you doing?

39:16.408 --> 39:17.636
I'm doing OK.

39:17.709 --> 39:19.768
- What's your name again?
- Jonathan Fisher.

39:19.845 --> 39:21.210
Jonathan! Right.

39:29.154 --> 39:31.179
Come on in. Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

39:31.256 --> 39:32.188
Can I get you some food?

39:32.257 --> 39:33.622
This is fine.

39:33.692 --> 39:34.750
How about
something to drink?

39:34.826 --> 39:37.351
- No, I'm fine.
- All right. Good.

39:45.370 --> 39:47.736
My man said to say hi to you.

39:47.806 --> 39:49.967
Who's that?

39:50.042 --> 39:51.805
My lawyer.

39:51.877 --> 39:53.310
Cat named Joel Davis.

39:53.378 --> 39:55.437
Mean anything to you?

39:57.049 --> 39:59.483
Whoa. Now, wait a minute here.

39:59.551 --> 40:01.519
You mean to tell me...

40:03.055 --> 40:04.818
What's the matter, boy?

40:04.890 --> 40:06.187
This ho said
you wanted to meet me.

40:06.258 --> 40:08.317
Well, here I am.

40:08.393 --> 40:09.758
What the hell you think
you're doing?

40:09.828 --> 40:10.795
What?

40:10.862 --> 40:13.353
There's money to be made
on the street.

40:13.432 --> 40:14.956
Get it snappin'!

40:17.569 --> 40:19.161
You're him, right?

40:19.237 --> 40:21.068
You're "Fast Black,"
aren't you?

40:21.139 --> 40:23.266
To some people.

40:23.342 --> 40:25.537
My mama always called me Leo.

40:26.445 --> 40:28.072
Leo Smalls, Jr.

40:28.146 --> 40:29.636
I don't believe it.

40:29.715 --> 40:30.739
You figured it out, huh?

40:30.816 --> 40:32.807
Smart boy.

40:32.884 --> 40:34.476
I want you to meet my editor.

40:35.887 --> 40:37.752
Oh, yeah? What for?

40:37.823 --> 40:39.313
'Cause he thinks
I'm writing about you.

40:40.392 --> 40:42.257
He does?

40:47.599 --> 40:49.157
Set it up.

40:49.234 --> 40:52.692
I mean, hey, you can write
about me now for real, right?

40:52.771 --> 40:54.329
- Huh?
- Yeah.

40:56.108 --> 40:58.975
Hey, Christine, give
this boy some ribs.

40:59.044 --> 41:03.208
I got to tell you, homey,
you don't know shit.

41:05.917 --> 41:07.407
I read that magazine.

41:07.486 --> 41:10.717
- Your dude...
- Tyrone.

41:10.789 --> 41:12.154
This dude is stupid.

41:12.224 --> 41:15.159
He wouldn't last
twenty minutes out here.

41:15.227 --> 41:17.058
A lot of people liked it.

41:17.129 --> 41:19.563
A lot of people got
their head up their ass.

41:21.733 --> 41:23.462
I will show you
the streets, brother.

41:39.317 --> 41:41.182
This is where I hang out.

41:41.253 --> 41:42.686
What's happening, Fast?

41:42.754 --> 41:44.688
Thought I'd play
a little ball.

41:44.756 --> 41:47.156
When you going
to take me downtown?

41:47.225 --> 41:49.591
They got dudes like him
down there, wall to wall.

41:49.661 --> 41:51.356
So?

41:51.430 --> 41:54.297
So? So they would chew
your young ass up...

41:54.366 --> 41:56.357
and spit you
all over 42nd Street.

41:56.435 --> 41:57.527
I been there.

41:57.602 --> 42:00.002
Get out of here.

42:00.072 --> 42:01.266
What you doin'?

42:01.339 --> 42:03.000
You playing basketball
or jerking off?

42:03.075 --> 42:04.167
Come on, baby.

42:04.242 --> 42:05.231
Pretty man is here.

42:05.310 --> 42:06.436
He moves to the basket.

42:06.511 --> 42:08.342
He lays it up there.

42:10.849 --> 42:12.544
Everybody play! Come on!

42:13.785 --> 42:16.219
He fakes them out
of their jocks.

42:16.288 --> 42:18.347
What's wrong with you, man?

42:18.423 --> 42:19.822
You stealing my shot?

42:21.560 --> 42:23.755
Nobody gets in my way,
you understand?

42:23.829 --> 42:25.626
I'll put your ass through
that motherfuckin' hoop!

42:25.697 --> 42:27.096
Who the fuck do you
think you are?

42:27.165 --> 42:29.360
I'm sorry.

42:29.434 --> 42:30.696
Do you know who
you're fucking with?

42:30.769 --> 42:32.361
Do you know who I am?!

42:32.437 --> 42:33.631
Sorry, man.

42:51.022 --> 42:52.922
Fuck it, man. It's cool.

42:54.593 --> 42:56.788
Hey, look, why don't
you do me a favor?

42:58.964 --> 43:00.295
Run over to Chicken City.

43:00.365 --> 43:01.491
Get me, uh...

43:01.566 --> 43:04.831
Get me some ribs, barbecued
chicken, and some pies.

43:04.903 --> 43:07.167
All that good shit, OK?

43:07.239 --> 43:08.228
Yeah. Sure!

43:11.443 --> 43:12.467
Yo, bro.

43:12.544 --> 43:14.478
Keep the change, all right?

43:14.546 --> 43:16.480
Yeah, sure. Thanks, man.

43:16.548 --> 43:18.982
Who got my glasses?

43:19.050 --> 43:20.244
Thanks.

43:22.020 --> 43:24.488
All right. I'm here.
I'm here.

43:24.556 --> 43:27.252
Give me the ball, baby!

43:28.226 --> 43:29.818
We don't like to lose.

43:52.250 --> 43:54.047
Hey, Harriet!

44:01.760 --> 44:03.022
Oh, man, what the...

44:03.094 --> 44:04.254
Harriet!

44:07.432 --> 44:08.865
Hey, come on!

44:08.934 --> 44:10.026
What?

44:10.101 --> 44:11.534
I want you to meet
my man here.

44:11.603 --> 44:13.969
He's going to put me on TV.

44:14.039 --> 44:15.506
This is Harriet, bro.

44:16.942 --> 44:19.308
You got some food.

44:19.377 --> 44:20.810
What you been doin',
sleeping again?

44:20.879 --> 44:23.370
I was collecting last night.
I'm tired.

44:23.448 --> 44:24.608
Ooh, what you got?

44:24.683 --> 44:26.082
We some got some chicken,
we got some ribs...

44:26.151 --> 44:27.516
we got a pie.

44:27.586 --> 44:29.554
You got any coffee?

44:29.621 --> 44:31.111
We got coffee.
God damn, make some!

44:31.189 --> 44:33.555
What you leanin' on me for?
I don't make coffee.

44:33.625 --> 44:37.026
All you get is dirty dishes
and lousy coffee.

44:37.095 --> 44:39.029
Whatever happened
to that dishwasher...

44:39.097 --> 44:40.689
you was supposed
to be buying me?

44:40.765 --> 44:42.027
What happened to
that little item?

44:42.100 --> 44:43.465
What the hell you gonna
do with a dishwasher?

44:43.535 --> 44:44.559
You don't ever cook nothin'.

44:44.636 --> 44:46.570
If I had a dishwasher,
maybe I would.

44:46.638 --> 44:48.230
I'm not gonna
mess up my nails.

44:48.306 --> 44:49.705
Hey, man, get me
a new shirt, OK?

44:49.774 --> 44:51.207
It's OK. I don't
want any, thanks.

44:51.276 --> 44:53.210
Who the fuck are you?

44:53.278 --> 44:54.711
I just told you who the man was.

44:54.779 --> 44:57.213
What he want, a TV? What?

44:57.282 --> 44:58.647
What is your problem?

44:58.717 --> 45:00.810
I don't have a problem.
You got one.

45:00.886 --> 45:03.719
Bullshit.
Not no more I ain't.

45:03.788 --> 45:06.222
You got a new one.

45:06.291 --> 45:07.258
Now what?

45:08.460 --> 45:09.927
Darlene.

45:12.898 --> 45:14.365
She thinks she's your partner.

45:14.432 --> 45:16.366
A hundred, a hundred fifty
a night.

45:19.838 --> 45:21.669
I'm gonna have to talk
to this bitch.

45:21.740 --> 45:23.207
Cut her loose.

45:23.275 --> 45:25.106
That ain't gonna do it.
I'm gonna have to talk to her.

45:25.176 --> 45:26.871
You can't do it 'cause
you're into poppin' her.

45:26.945 --> 45:28.606
That's your new piece,
all set up.

45:28.680 --> 45:30.739
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

45:30.815 --> 45:32.043
You wipe the floor
with everybody else...

45:32.117 --> 45:33.448
but you kiss Darlene's ass.

45:33.518 --> 45:34.610
Keep it up. Let me catch her.

45:34.686 --> 45:35.618
Move your foot.

45:35.687 --> 45:37.120
OK, I got something
for both of you.

45:37.188 --> 45:38.621
Keep playin' with me.
All right?

45:38.690 --> 45:40.123
Just keep it.
Just keep on.

45:40.191 --> 45:42.125
Why don't you clean
this place up sometime?!

45:42.193 --> 45:44.991
Ask Darlene!
I'm not your maid.

45:46.865 --> 45:49.060
What you going to do, man?

45:49.134 --> 45:52.194
I don't know. That's tough.

45:54.039 --> 45:55.404
Tighten up, Reggie.

45:55.473 --> 45:56.940
Let's ride.

45:57.008 --> 45:58.475
Come on.

45:58.543 --> 45:59.942
Bring the chicken.

46:09.554 --> 46:11.715
What do them TV broads make?

46:11.790 --> 46:12.916
What do you mean?

46:12.991 --> 46:15.118
Them broads that tell the news,
what do they make?

46:15.193 --> 46:16.353
You watch the news?

46:16.428 --> 46:17.759
Hell, yeah, I watch the news!

46:17.829 --> 46:19.091
I hit the streets...

46:19.164 --> 46:22.099
I got to know what the fuck
is going on, right?

46:22.167 --> 46:23.600
Them TV broads, man.

46:23.668 --> 46:26.228
I know dudes that would
pay five grand a night...

46:26.304 --> 46:28.602
just to fuck
one of them broads.

46:28.673 --> 46:30.106
I ain't lying!

46:30.175 --> 46:31.369
You know that blond one...

46:31.443 --> 46:32.967
the one that talks
through her teeth...

46:33.044 --> 46:35.103
wears them big-ass glasses?

46:35.180 --> 46:37.114
"Over on Flatbush Avenue
two guys got off..."

46:37.182 --> 46:40.015
I know motherfuckers
that would kill...

46:40.085 --> 46:41.950
to fuck this bitch, man.

46:42.020 --> 46:43.612
I'm telling you.

46:43.688 --> 46:45.121
They don't make
two grand a night, do they?

46:45.190 --> 46:46.623
No. They make a lot...

46:46.691 --> 46:47.919
they don't make
that kind of money.

46:47.993 --> 46:50.689
I can give them two
and keep three for myself.

46:50.762 --> 46:53.925
Brother, if I had a couple
of them TV broads...

46:53.999 --> 46:56.627
I would fuckin' retire.
You know what I mean?

46:56.701 --> 46:58.396
Honolulu, here I come.

46:58.470 --> 46:59.960
Look out. You know?

47:00.038 --> 47:01.596
I think maybe I ought to
mention this to them.

47:02.874 --> 47:05.001
Yeah! Do that.

47:10.215 --> 47:13.013
Hey, look, do you
know this D. A?

47:15.920 --> 47:17.785
How come the guy's got
such a fuckin' hard-on for me?

47:19.324 --> 47:20.416
I don't know.
Can't tell you.

47:20.492 --> 47:23.017
Where does he get off
talking about murder two?

47:23.094 --> 47:24.994
That ain't fair.

47:27.499 --> 47:29.763
I don't know.

47:29.834 --> 47:33.600
Between the law and the outlaw,
fair ain't even in it.

47:34.239 --> 47:35.763
There she is.

47:35.840 --> 47:37.364
Pull over.

47:37.442 --> 47:39.876
Yo, Darlene!

47:39.944 --> 47:41.343
Get your tushy
snappin' over here.

47:55.293 --> 47:56.385
Get in.

47:56.461 --> 47:57.587
This side.

48:06.137 --> 48:07.604
How you doing, baby?

48:26.324 --> 48:28.019
How'd you do last night?

48:28.093 --> 48:29.651
What'd I give you, 450?

48:31.830 --> 48:34.162
Try maybe 550 or 6.

48:35.500 --> 48:36.933
I give you all I got.

48:40.772 --> 48:41.898
Good.

48:46.144 --> 48:47.702
I take the bread.

48:47.779 --> 48:49.269
The whole loaf, you understand?

48:49.347 --> 48:50.473
You want money,
you come to me.

48:50.548 --> 48:52.243
You try going into business
for yourself...

48:52.317 --> 48:53.284
you'll be one dead whore.

48:53.351 --> 48:54.283
Not my face, please.

48:54.352 --> 48:55.910
It's not your face, bitch.
It's my face.

48:55.987 --> 48:56.919
My tits and my ass!

48:56.988 --> 48:59.422
- Take it easy.
- Yeah?

49:29.254 --> 49:30.846
- Whose girl are you?
- Yours.

49:31.856 --> 49:32.948
Yours, baby.

49:44.235 --> 49:45.896
Now get out of here.

50:12.964 --> 50:15.398
You look a little
paler than usual, boy.

50:15.466 --> 50:16.899
You play rough.

50:16.968 --> 50:19.630
It ain't all basketball
and dishwashers out here.

50:19.704 --> 50:21.296
Move it out, Reg.

50:33.718 --> 50:36.050
I took a cab out out of
the Charles Street garage...

50:36.120 --> 50:38.054
this morning
and spent the day driving.

50:38.122 --> 50:40.556
It meant traffic snarls,
lost tempers...

50:40.625 --> 50:43.059
but a new respect for
the cabdrivers of New York.

50:43.127 --> 50:45.391
At the intersection
of 23rd and Roosevelt...

50:45.463 --> 50:47.055
I was pulled over
by Charles McGrath...

50:47.131 --> 50:49.395
inspector with the Taxi
and Limousine Commission.

50:49.467 --> 50:50.695
What's the problem here?

50:52.437 --> 50:55.406
You dropped a guy back there
and you're off meter.

50:55.473 --> 50:57.566
I didn't have anybody
in the car.

50:57.642 --> 50:58.870
I saw you.

51:01.412 --> 51:02.344
Give me a break.

51:02.413 --> 51:03.573
I'm trying to make
a living here.

51:03.648 --> 51:05.081
I understand that.

51:05.149 --> 51:06.514
But I got great news for you.

51:06.584 --> 51:10.179
You can avoid all the paperwork
and pay the fine right here.

51:10.255 --> 51:12.553
Fifty bucks cash and bye-bye.

51:28.473 --> 51:29.667
I got news for you.

51:30.708 --> 51:31.834
You see the van right there?

51:32.744 --> 51:34.405
You're on TV.

51:34.479 --> 51:35.912
Have a nice day.

51:35.980 --> 51:37.914
You son of a bitch.

51:37.982 --> 51:41.315
This is Jonathan Fisher,
Channel 3, "Street Smart."

51:47.158 --> 51:48.284
What?

51:50.495 --> 51:52.690
I'm sorry. He's gonna
have to call you back.

51:54.399 --> 51:56.458
He can't come
to the phone right now.

52:00.672 --> 52:02.139
Just a minute.

52:05.176 --> 52:06.609
Who is it?

52:06.678 --> 52:07.770
Punchy.

52:07.845 --> 52:09.813
I better take it.

52:18.756 --> 52:20.724
This isn't
a real good time to talk.

52:20.792 --> 52:22.760
I'm in the bath.

52:30.068 --> 52:31.501
It's East 68th Street...

52:31.569 --> 52:34.003
between Park and Lex,
number 110.

52:34.072 --> 52:36.802
See you out there about 8:00.
Is that OK?

52:38.343 --> 52:39.901
So we're all set
on that, right?

52:44.082 --> 52:46.482
They forgot the directions.

52:46.551 --> 52:48.485
It's bad enough you hanging out
with these people.

52:48.553 --> 52:50.384
I really don't like them
calling here.

52:51.089 --> 52:52.647
Right.
I'll tell them not to.

52:56.260 --> 52:58.524
Do you really think
this is such a good idea?

53:00.264 --> 53:02.528
Yeah. I think it's gonna be
a hell of a mix.

53:15.213 --> 53:17.647
Hey, kids.
How are you doing?

53:17.715 --> 53:19.478
Tyrone, at last!

53:19.550 --> 53:20.983
How you doing?

53:21.052 --> 53:24.988
So this is what you really
look like, in the flesh.

53:25.056 --> 53:26.489
In the flesh.

53:26.557 --> 53:27.990
We are delighted to have you.

53:28.059 --> 53:29.526
And this is Punchy.

53:33.264 --> 53:35.232
Come on in.
Everybody wants to meet you.

53:35.299 --> 53:38.291
The whole world is here,
except Henry Spussen.

53:38.369 --> 53:39.461
Oh, I know him already.

53:39.537 --> 53:41.004
Really? How do you know Henry?

53:41.072 --> 53:42.164
Hey, everybody!

53:42.240 --> 53:44.504
The guest of honor!

53:48.446 --> 53:49.913
Can I get you a drink?

53:49.981 --> 53:51.642
You got a chocolate drink?

53:51.716 --> 53:52.808
A chocolate drink?

53:52.884 --> 53:54.146
You know, with no fizz.

53:54.218 --> 53:55.480
A chocolate drink, no fizz.

53:55.553 --> 53:56.986
Just the way
Mommy used to make it.

53:57.054 --> 53:58.316
I'll take a bourbon.

53:58.389 --> 54:00.357
You've got bourbon.
Come on.

54:03.094 --> 54:04.527
We'll squeeze our way through.

54:04.595 --> 54:06.529
Hey, you really did it.

54:06.597 --> 54:09.031
I really did it.

54:09.100 --> 54:10.192
Punchy.

54:10.268 --> 54:11.428
Teddy Bear.

54:16.641 --> 54:19.132
Are we gonna have to
stay here a long time?

54:20.278 --> 54:22.303
This is great.
Look at him go.

54:22.380 --> 54:23.642
Nice to meet you.

54:24.849 --> 54:26.316
How you doing, man?

54:28.119 --> 54:29.780
Isn't this fun, Alison?

54:33.224 --> 54:34.657
You like it?

54:34.725 --> 54:36.090
It's yours
for twenty-five grand.

54:37.361 --> 54:38.658
You mean to tell me...

54:38.729 --> 54:42.096
this dumb motherfucker paid
twenty-five Gs for this shit?

54:45.670 --> 54:50.164
I read in Jon's article
that you have a condo in Maui.

54:54.245 --> 54:55.610
You're not
going to believe this...

54:55.680 --> 54:58.615
but you and I are neighbors.

54:58.683 --> 55:00.173
Now, ain't that a bitch?

55:03.721 --> 55:06.053
So, you do the TV news?

55:06.123 --> 55:09.490
Lady, I could change
your life forever.

55:15.066 --> 55:16.431
Trish, I'm sorry.

55:16.501 --> 55:19.265
Trish, I know you'd like
to meet Jonathan Fisher.

55:19.337 --> 55:20.304
How do you do?

55:20.371 --> 55:21.338
Alison Parker.

55:21.405 --> 55:23.396
Excuse me, got to pee.

55:24.675 --> 55:26.302
Is he really her pimp?

55:27.345 --> 55:29.836
Oh, God. Can I meet them?

55:29.914 --> 55:30.938
Oh, Trish, you can take them...

55:31.015 --> 55:33.483
to the Southampton
horse show if you like.

55:33.551 --> 55:36.884
Do you wear sheer
black underwear?

55:36.954 --> 55:39.422
Oh, honey, I don't
wear no underwear at all.

55:42.660 --> 55:45.026
Have you met my wife Sheena?

55:46.898 --> 55:51.028
Do you want to see
something really beautiful?

55:52.904 --> 55:54.030
Excuse me.

55:55.973 --> 55:59.340
You don't turn those notes
over to anyone, Jonathan.

55:59.410 --> 56:00.638
I'll back you up.

56:00.711 --> 56:02.406
I'll go to the wall for you.

56:02.480 --> 56:05.142
That's good to know, Ted.

56:05.216 --> 56:06.547
Excuse me.

56:08.252 --> 56:10.243
You want to hear something
really interesting?

56:10.321 --> 56:11.652
Do you know you've got...

56:11.722 --> 56:13.485
the prettiest titties
I have ever seen?

56:13.558 --> 56:17.358
The whole town wanted
to be invited to this one.

56:19.030 --> 56:20.088
Party of the year.

56:20.164 --> 56:23.463
He really has put it
all together, hasn't he?

56:23.534 --> 56:25.764
You know, he's too good
for television.

56:25.836 --> 56:27.133
He belongs in print.

56:27.204 --> 56:28.637
I guess so.

56:28.706 --> 56:30.674
You must be very proud of him.

56:38.382 --> 56:41.010
I'm thrilled.
Would you excuse me?

56:46.390 --> 56:48.153
Would you excuse us
for a second?

56:48.225 --> 56:49.157
Sure.

56:49.226 --> 56:50.488
Thank you.

56:50.561 --> 56:51.823
I'm leaving.

56:51.896 --> 56:53.329
Oh, come on, we just got here.

56:53.397 --> 56:54.989
You can tell stories
to that magazine...

56:55.066 --> 56:55.998
but don't bullshit me.

56:56.067 --> 56:56.999
Wait a minute.

56:57.068 --> 56:57.966
Let go of my arm.

56:58.035 --> 56:59.127
What's the matter?

56:59.203 --> 57:02.070
I know you're fucking that girl.

57:10.581 --> 57:12.048
Is something wrong?

57:14.051 --> 57:16.212
Yes and no.

57:17.855 --> 57:20.483
I could do things for you, lady.

57:21.926 --> 57:23.518
Ted, thanks a lot.

57:23.594 --> 57:25.152
I think it's time to go.

57:26.097 --> 57:28.691
But we've got a ton of sushi.

57:29.734 --> 57:31.861
They're so nice.

57:31.936 --> 57:33.699
You're one dumb asshole, Punchy.

57:33.771 --> 57:35.033
You know that?

57:35.106 --> 57:36.266
Some people
was laughing at you.

57:36.340 --> 57:37.432
Can't you see nothin'?

57:37.508 --> 57:39.032
You're some kind of
fucking joke to them.

57:39.110 --> 57:41.044
I had a good time. Come on.

57:43.180 --> 57:45.546
He's right.
They were patronizing you.

57:45.616 --> 57:47.550
There you go talking
that Harvard shit again.

57:47.618 --> 57:49.586
You did fine. I thought
you guys were great.

57:49.654 --> 57:52.555
Who do you think
you're patronizing now?

57:52.623 --> 57:54.614
She might take that shit, man.
I don't.

57:54.692 --> 57:57.092
I don't have to go to Harvard
to know what you're doing.

57:57.161 --> 57:59.391
You know what I'm trying
to say to you?

58:01.866 --> 58:02.958
Yes, I do.

58:03.034 --> 58:04.661
Then shut the fuck up.

58:04.735 --> 58:07.533
You don't tell me
how people react to me.

58:07.605 --> 58:09.129
I know what people are doing
no matter what they say.

58:09.206 --> 58:11.299
'Cause I read minds, you dig?

58:11.375 --> 58:13.400
I don't take
no shit off of you.

58:13.477 --> 58:15.172
You're lying through
your fuckin' teeth.

58:15.246 --> 58:17.680
I know it, you know it,
and this fuckin' whore know it.

58:17.748 --> 58:18.772
Come on, leave him alone.

58:23.654 --> 58:25.087
Night's over. Come on.

58:25.156 --> 58:26.088
What are you doing?

58:26.157 --> 58:27.715
Whatever the fuck I want!

58:27.792 --> 58:29.521
Get in the car!

58:30.561 --> 58:33.029
Alison, you are overreacting.

58:33.097 --> 58:34.496
I know I made a big mistake.

58:34.565 --> 58:35.998
So did I.

58:36.067 --> 58:37.898
It didn't mean anything.

58:37.968 --> 58:38.992
It just kind of happened.

58:39.070 --> 58:42.005
You make me sick!
I don't need this shit!

58:42.073 --> 58:44.337
Jesus, I don't even
know who you are anymore.

58:44.408 --> 58:45.841
And what I see,
I don't like.

58:45.910 --> 58:47.002
You suck up to Ted...

58:47.078 --> 58:48.841
you go around with
these disgusting people...

58:48.913 --> 58:50.005
and you don't even care.

58:50.081 --> 58:51.343
Don't say that to me.

58:51.415 --> 58:52.848
You can say
anything you want...

58:52.917 --> 58:54.680
but... don't say that,
because I do care.

58:54.752 --> 58:56.344
Yeah, right.

58:56.420 --> 59:00.686
Alison, let's not
throw this away, please.

59:00.758 --> 59:02.191
Where are you going?

59:02.259 --> 59:04.193
To Susan's,
if she'll take me back.

59:04.261 --> 59:06.695
Susan's? World's worst roommate.

59:06.764 --> 59:09.164
No. You're the world's
worst roommate.

59:13.871 --> 59:16.032
Under the Constitution,
Mr. Smalls has a right...

59:16.107 --> 59:18.575
to a fair and speedy trial.

59:18.642 --> 59:20.405
Mr. Smalls' freedom is at stake.

59:20.478 --> 59:21.638
A conviction...

59:21.712 --> 59:22.906
We're not interested
in your lectures...

59:22.980 --> 59:24.038
anymore, Mr. Sheffield.

59:24.115 --> 59:25.047
Your Honor,
this is a blatant attempt...

59:25.116 --> 59:26.549
to obfuscate the issue.

59:26.617 --> 59:28.050
If there's
an evidentiary reason...

59:28.119 --> 59:29.984
for the defense
to see Mr. Fisher's notes...

59:30.054 --> 59:31.544
let them state it clearly.

59:31.622 --> 59:33.487
I have no intention of
allowing this matter...

59:33.557 --> 59:34.990
to either obfuscate
or delay.

59:35.059 --> 59:36.993
However, if there is
evidence bearing on this case...

59:37.061 --> 59:39.154
the court will hear it,
from whatever quarter.

59:39.230 --> 59:40.663
Mr. Fisher, you will
assemble your notes...

59:40.731 --> 59:42.926
and all pertinent documents
with or about Mr. Smalls...

59:43.000 --> 59:45.992
and present them to the court
for in-camera examination.

59:46.070 --> 59:47.662
Your honor, Mr. Fisher
would like permission...

59:47.738 --> 59:49.137
to address the court
if he may.

59:49.206 --> 59:50.833
Briefly, Mr. Fisher.

59:50.908 --> 59:52.739
Briefly.

59:52.810 --> 59:55.608
Your Honor, I would ask
the court to recognize...

59:55.679 --> 59:58.341
the difficulty of the choice
that confronts me.

59:58.415 --> 01:00:00.178
No speeches. The court's
order is clear.

01:00:00.251 --> 01:00:01.479
Are you ready to comply?

01:00:01.552 --> 01:00:04.851
Your Honor, I don't think that
I have a choice in this matter.

01:00:04.922 --> 01:00:06.617
I can't surrender my notes.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:08.180
The choice you have made
is to seek publicity...

01:00:08.259 --> 01:00:09.521
and I will not have it.

01:00:09.593 --> 01:00:10.651
That's an unfair assumption...

01:00:10.728 --> 01:00:11.695
You're in contempt,
Mr. Fisher...

01:00:11.762 --> 01:00:12.956
and I sentence you
to be incarcerated...

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:15.191
until such time as you purge
yourself of that contempt...

01:00:15.266 --> 01:00:16.665
and comply with
the court's order.

01:00:16.734 --> 01:00:18.326
Your Honor, we would like
time before the sentence...

01:00:18.402 --> 01:00:19.869
to put Mr. Fisher's
affairs in order.

01:00:19.937 --> 01:00:21.302
We wish to file an appeal.

01:00:21.372 --> 01:00:22.703
You may file all
the appeals the law allows...

01:00:22.773 --> 01:00:24.172
but I will not
stay the sentence.

01:00:24.241 --> 01:00:25.538
No one, absolutely no one...

01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:27.941
refuses to comply
with my subpoenas...

01:00:28.012 --> 01:00:29.479
or withholds
evidence from my court.

01:00:29.547 --> 01:00:31.515
Remove the prisoner.

01:00:41.325 --> 01:00:42.622
Mr. Fisher.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.953
Newsstand sales are up
eight percent.

01:01:18.028 --> 01:01:19.996
It's you, Jonathan.

01:01:20.064 --> 01:01:23.295
Your moral courage
sells magazines.

01:01:23.367 --> 01:01:25.961
Ted, what about the appeal?

01:01:26.036 --> 01:01:27.469
Sheffield's working on it.

01:01:27.538 --> 01:01:29.733
You know, that assistant
district attorney...

01:01:29.807 --> 01:01:31.832
he has been all over us...

01:01:31.909 --> 01:01:33.206
trying to make you
give up your notes.

01:01:33.277 --> 01:01:34.938
No way.

01:01:36.413 --> 01:01:38.074
Oh, "Newsweek."

01:01:38.148 --> 01:01:40.912
"Newsweek's" talking about
putting you on the cover.

01:01:40.985 --> 01:01:42.418
Sorry, "Newsweek" what?

01:01:42.486 --> 01:01:44.454
They're talking about
putting you on the cover!

01:01:44.521 --> 01:01:48.423
Except you might get out of here
before the issue closes.

01:01:48.492 --> 01:01:51.290
You're not going to hold up
the appeal over that, I hope?

01:01:54.965 --> 01:01:57.433
I want you to keep a diary.

01:01:57.501 --> 01:01:58.559
What?

01:01:58.636 --> 01:01:59.796
A diary!

01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:03.203
"The Prison Diaries
of Jonathan Fisher."

01:02:05.142 --> 01:02:07.508
It would be good if they
wore uniforms in here.

01:02:07.578 --> 01:02:09.512
Ted, would you just
get me out of here?!

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.515
Would you just hurry up
and get me out of here?

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:15.051
As soon as possible,
Jonathan.

01:02:18.923 --> 01:02:20.515
You ignored the shield laws?

01:02:20.591 --> 01:02:22.559
You guys want to give me
a break? Thanks.

01:02:24.094 --> 01:02:25.527
I'm sorry. There's gonna be
a statement later.

01:02:25.596 --> 01:02:27.530
Can't you give
your own statement?

01:02:27.598 --> 01:02:28.895
No, I'm sorry.

01:02:28.966 --> 01:02:30.831
Did you make a deal
to get out?

01:02:30.901 --> 01:02:32.334
I'm out pending an appeal.

01:02:32.403 --> 01:02:35.133
My position hasn't changed.
I don't think it will.

01:02:35.205 --> 01:02:37.469
A lot of people think that man
should be behind bars.

01:02:37.541 --> 01:02:38.633
Well, that might be.

01:02:38.709 --> 01:02:40.643
That's certainly not
the issue here. Excuse me.

01:02:40.711 --> 01:02:42.042
Why did you choose a subject...

01:02:42.112 --> 01:02:44.307
that embodies the worst
of black people?

01:02:44.381 --> 01:02:47.544
You can't pretend that people
like this don't exist, can you?

01:02:47.618 --> 01:02:49.552
It might not be
conscious racism...

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.451
but it is racism.

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:55.786
We've been talking
with Jonathan Fisher...

01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:58.521
released today from the
Queens House of Detention.

01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:12.608
What's happening?

01:03:16.146 --> 01:03:18.614
This ain't bad, man.

01:03:23.153 --> 01:03:25.121
What's this, a social call?

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:28.424
He wants to see you.

01:03:28.492 --> 01:03:29.424
That's too bad.

01:03:29.493 --> 01:03:30.926
I'm in the middle of something.

01:03:31.695 --> 01:03:34.323
He wants to see you now.

01:03:34.398 --> 01:03:36.332
He barks and you jump?

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.300
I don't know how you
put up with that all day.

01:03:43.007 --> 01:03:44.975
So how was it inside?

01:03:45.042 --> 01:03:46.942
I wasn't crazy about it.

01:03:47.011 --> 01:03:49.639
Right.
I've been there, Jack.

01:03:49.713 --> 01:03:50.805
It ain't heaven.

01:03:50.881 --> 01:03:52.075
I'll quote you.

01:03:54.318 --> 01:03:55.717
What I got on you...

01:03:55.786 --> 01:03:58.152
I could blow you
out of the water.

01:03:58.222 --> 01:03:59.382
Wouldn't help you much,
would it?

01:04:00.724 --> 01:04:03.158
So I got us a new plan.

01:04:03.227 --> 01:04:04.660
You're gonna write them notes...

01:04:04.728 --> 01:04:06.662
that everybody's
been asking for...

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:07.822
but in them you're gonna say...

01:04:07.898 --> 01:04:09.661
that on the day that
that dude bought it...

01:04:09.733 --> 01:04:12.327
you and I were in Rockaway
somewhere having a hot dog.

01:04:12.403 --> 01:04:15.372
See, that way, you get off
the hook, and so do I.

01:04:15.439 --> 01:04:17.407
The court won't buy that.

01:04:17.474 --> 01:04:18.839
I don't know.

01:04:18.909 --> 01:04:21.343
They tell me you're
a very skilled writer.

01:04:21.412 --> 01:04:22.674
It's called conspiracy.

01:04:22.746 --> 01:04:23.872
Fuck that.

01:04:25.582 --> 01:04:29.018
You fuck with me on this,
I'm going to get you.

01:04:29.086 --> 01:04:30.280
And not only you, brother.

01:04:30.354 --> 01:04:32.288
I'm gonna reach out and get
everybody around you.

01:04:32.356 --> 01:04:33.948
Don't you threaten me.

01:04:34.024 --> 01:04:35.787
You listen to me, asshole.

01:04:35.859 --> 01:04:37.451
I got a very good nose on me...

01:04:37.528 --> 01:04:38.961
and right now
there's two smells.

01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:41.122
The first one says I do fifteen
to twenty years in Attica.

01:04:41.198 --> 01:04:42.290
The other one says I walk.

01:04:42.366 --> 01:04:43.833
I ain't taking
no fucking vote on this.

01:04:43.901 --> 01:04:44.993
You got me?

01:04:46.703 --> 01:04:49.001
I'm not going to do that.

01:04:51.208 --> 01:04:52.800
We'll see about that.

01:04:52.876 --> 01:04:54.707
Pull the fucking car over.

01:05:10.327 --> 01:05:12.522
The irony here is that
while city officials...

01:05:12.563 --> 01:05:14.622
say there are alternatives
for the homeless...

01:05:14.698 --> 01:05:18.634
the ACLU continues to defend
their right not to go.

01:05:18.702 --> 01:05:21.637
This is Jonathan Fisher, Channel
3, "Street Smart."

01:05:21.705 --> 01:05:22.797
Cut it.

01:05:22.873 --> 01:05:25.671
Those guys really
make my job tough.

01:05:27.077 --> 01:05:29.011
Hey, Punchy,
how are you doing?

01:05:29.079 --> 01:05:30.273
You got a minute?

01:05:30.347 --> 01:05:32.144
Yeah, what's up?

01:05:40.557 --> 01:05:41.785
Oh, Jesus...

01:05:41.859 --> 01:05:43.451
Fast?

01:05:43.527 --> 01:05:46.462
He left the face alone
this time so I could work.

01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:48.293
You better get out of town.
You need money?

01:05:48.365 --> 01:05:49.923
He'd just come after me.

01:05:51.468 --> 01:05:52.594
I've been through worse.

01:05:53.871 --> 01:05:55.930
If I leave,
I break the rules.

01:05:58.175 --> 01:06:00.075
You better give him
what he wants.

01:06:00.711 --> 01:06:02.338
I can't do that.

01:06:02.412 --> 01:06:05.108
Then you're going to be next.

01:06:06.216 --> 01:06:08.013
I got to go. Take care.

01:06:20.164 --> 01:06:22.132
What do you mean,
people are getting hurt?

01:06:22.199 --> 01:06:23.564
Just believe me.

01:06:23.634 --> 01:06:26.159
I'm telling you this guy
is totally unpredictable.

01:06:26.236 --> 01:06:28.329
What am I supposed to do?

01:06:34.311 --> 01:06:36.370
Why don't you
come home with me?

01:06:38.015 --> 01:06:41.348
I'm not ready for that yet.

01:06:46.323 --> 01:06:48.257
I want you to stay here,
out of sight.

01:06:48.325 --> 01:06:51.089
I have a job.

01:06:51.161 --> 01:06:53.459
You're going to
have to call in sick.

01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:54.792
For how long?

01:06:54.865 --> 01:06:56.298
Until I can get
this thing settled.

01:06:56.366 --> 01:06:58.061
I got an appointment with
Sheffield tomorrow at 10:00.

01:06:58.135 --> 01:07:00.501
I'm going to try to do it
as fast as I can.

01:07:01.538 --> 01:07:02.630
Can I go with you?

01:07:06.743 --> 01:07:08.301
That would be good.

01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:15.375
Say good night
to Susan for me.

01:07:19.523 --> 01:07:20.956
You be careful.

01:07:21.024 --> 01:07:22.150
I will.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.574
Want a date, Mr. White?

01:07:38.642 --> 01:07:40.610
I got an ass on me
like a Mississippi mule.

01:07:40.677 --> 01:07:42.110
I'll rock it and knock it off.

01:07:42.179 --> 01:07:45.945
Fall for me, baby.
I got what you need.

01:07:48.151 --> 01:07:49.778
Hey, business suit.

01:07:49.853 --> 01:07:50.979
Come here.

01:07:56.326 --> 01:07:58.123
Hey, come on, sugar.

01:07:59.329 --> 01:08:01.092
What do you say,
want to go out?

01:08:03.934 --> 01:08:04.923
Let's go.

01:08:05.002 --> 01:08:06.936
My place, all right?

01:08:07.004 --> 01:08:08.471
I don't know about that.

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.432
Why not?

01:08:11.508 --> 01:08:12.702
Where do you live?

01:08:14.344 --> 01:08:15.834
I'll pay you double.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.410
My usual's a hundred.

01:08:22.352 --> 01:08:23.580
Hundred?

01:08:24.688 --> 01:08:26.154
It's worth it.

01:08:28.024 --> 01:08:30.255
All right.

01:08:45.042 --> 01:08:46.304
Nice crib.

01:08:46.376 --> 01:08:47.809
There's a waiting list
to get in.

01:08:47.877 --> 01:08:49.845
I got the same problem.

01:08:54.384 --> 01:08:56.352
Don't touch me, all right?

01:09:12.402 --> 01:09:15.529
I'm sorry. I didn't
have time to...

01:09:15.604 --> 01:09:18.573
Don't worry.
You won't be here long.

01:09:20.109 --> 01:09:21.202
Is that a boast?

01:09:31.188 --> 01:09:32.951
Would you like a drink?

01:09:33.023 --> 01:09:34.115
Yeah, sure.

01:09:34.191 --> 01:09:36.658
I'll take a bourbon,
straight up.

01:09:55.379 --> 01:09:56.846
What's going on?

01:09:59.049 --> 01:10:00.243
I think you know.

01:10:01.752 --> 01:10:04.186
Get the feeling you didn't bring
me here 'cause you're horny.

01:10:04.254 --> 01:10:05.346
That's right.

01:10:07.891 --> 01:10:10.052
I think you should know
I'm in a position...

01:10:10.127 --> 01:10:12.027
to have you arrested
if I want to.

01:10:12.095 --> 01:10:14.859
It's not hard
to get me arrested.

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:21.503
What do you want?

01:10:21.571 --> 01:10:24.005
I'm prosecuting
a friend of yours.

01:10:24.074 --> 01:10:25.701
I'm going to get
another drink.

01:10:25.776 --> 01:10:27.676
Who would that be?

01:10:27.744 --> 01:10:31.976
I've been watching you,
and sometimes you're dumb...

01:10:32.048 --> 01:10:33.310
and sometimes you're smart.

01:10:33.383 --> 01:10:35.613
Let's make this
one of the smart times.

01:10:35.685 --> 01:10:38.119
Where did you
get those clothes?

01:10:38.188 --> 01:10:41.123
You worried about the good taste
patrol or something?

01:10:41.191 --> 01:10:42.283
The what?

01:10:42.359 --> 01:10:44.987
What are you supposed to be,
Winston Churchill?

01:10:45.061 --> 01:10:46.153
Look, I want to know...

01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:48.129
what the big deal is
about these notes.

01:10:48.198 --> 01:10:49.290
What notes?

01:10:49.366 --> 01:10:51.493
Your friend the reporter.

01:10:51.568 --> 01:10:52.660
Jonathan Fisher.

01:10:53.937 --> 01:10:56.030
Him.

01:10:56.106 --> 01:10:57.539
I give him head.

01:10:57.607 --> 01:11:00.337
I don't know what
he writes down. I don't care.

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:01.672
I don't believe that.

01:11:01.745 --> 01:11:03.212
I don't know what
to tell you, then.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.372
Think of something.

01:11:04.448 --> 01:11:06.075
I think you probably
like it kinky.

01:11:07.617 --> 01:11:09.551
Don't try to change
the subject.

01:11:11.621 --> 01:11:15.057
You think I got something
that will help you?

01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:16.558
Well, I do.

01:11:16.626 --> 01:11:19.060
I know what you really want.

01:11:19.129 --> 01:11:21.563
You want to do
things to me. Hmm?

01:11:21.631 --> 01:11:24.361
You want to maybe
hurt me a little bit?

01:11:24.434 --> 01:11:27.062
Don't you?
Come on, you can face it.

01:11:27.137 --> 01:11:28.229
It's OK.

01:11:28.305 --> 01:11:29.670
Face what you want.

01:11:29.739 --> 01:11:31.673
It's fine. I know you.

01:11:31.741 --> 01:11:33.140
I know you better
than you think.

01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:34.643
I know what
you dream about.

01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:36.144
Look, maybe you
should just go.

01:11:36.213 --> 01:11:38.977
Baby, I got everything
you need right here.

01:11:39.049 --> 01:11:40.482
You should just leave.

01:11:42.085 --> 01:11:43.017
Out!

01:11:43.086 --> 01:11:45.520
Just relax.
It's all right. Look...

01:11:45.589 --> 01:11:47.022
Don't start that shit.

01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:48.489
You paid for it.
I didn't know...

01:11:48.558 --> 01:11:49.490
Out.

01:11:49.559 --> 01:11:50.651
All right.

01:11:50.727 --> 01:11:51.694
Now.

01:11:51.761 --> 01:11:53.023
Just cool out.

01:11:53.096 --> 01:11:54.393
I'm going, see?

01:11:55.599 --> 01:11:57.533
Wait a minute. Would you...

01:11:57.601 --> 01:11:58.533
Oh, please.

01:11:58.602 --> 01:12:00.570
Would you zip that up?

01:12:05.108 --> 01:12:06.905
Oh, shit.

01:12:30.567 --> 01:12:32.967
You've got a good case.

01:12:33.036 --> 01:12:34.060
I don't mind saying...

01:12:34.137 --> 01:12:37.129
that I'm very I'm pleased
with our position.

01:12:37.207 --> 01:12:39.107
What are we
talking about here?

01:12:39.175 --> 01:12:42.372
Are you being threatened?

01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:44.276
Yes, I am.

01:12:44.347 --> 01:12:46.474
Well, Jonathan, there are
legal remedies for that.

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:47.983
We could always
apply to the court...

01:12:48.051 --> 01:12:49.279
to have his bail revoked.

01:12:49.352 --> 01:12:50.785
Art, that's just part of it.

01:12:50.854 --> 01:12:52.845
This is more than a question
of legal maneuvers now.

01:12:54.591 --> 01:12:55.956
Then procedurally,
I think it would be best...

01:12:56.026 --> 01:12:58.358
if you give me the notes,
tapes, whatever.

01:12:58.428 --> 01:12:59.486
I'll make copies of everything.

01:12:59.563 --> 01:13:00.655
You're not getting me.

01:13:00.730 --> 01:13:02.129
I'm trying to tell you
there aren't any notes.

01:13:02.198 --> 01:13:03.130
There's no notes.

01:13:03.199 --> 01:13:04.325
No tapes, nothing.

01:13:04.401 --> 01:13:06.961
He made the whole thing up.
It's fiction.

01:13:07.037 --> 01:13:10.302
I'm the only other person
who knows what happened.

01:13:10.373 --> 01:13:13.035
And I want
to end this thing right now.

01:13:31.328 --> 01:13:32.989
You're finished.

01:13:33.063 --> 01:13:34.621
This is
the most outrageous lie...

01:13:34.698 --> 01:13:36.791
I've heard in over twenty years
on the bench.

01:13:36.866 --> 01:13:38.595
Sir, I apologize to the court.

01:13:38.668 --> 01:13:40.135
And I apologize
to the rest of the press...

01:13:40.203 --> 01:13:41.295
and to the public.

01:13:41.371 --> 01:13:44.670
I had no idea
this would go so far.

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:49.102
Mr. Sheffield,
have you discussed...

01:13:49.179 --> 01:13:51.079
the laws of perjury
with your client?

01:13:51.147 --> 01:13:52.136
Mr. Fisher is prepared...

01:13:52.215 --> 01:13:53.648
to stand behind his statement,
Your Honor.

01:13:53.717 --> 01:13:54.979
I, however, find myself...

01:13:55.051 --> 01:13:56.814
facing an irreconcilable
conflict of interest...

01:13:56.886 --> 01:13:58.615
in this matter...

01:13:58.688 --> 01:14:00.622
and I would ask the court's
permission to allow me...

01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:03.284
to withdraw from the remainder
of these proceedings.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.794
I'll take it
under consideration.

01:14:05.862 --> 01:14:07.921
Young man, you baffle me.

01:14:07.998 --> 01:14:10.831
You may continue
your original appeal...

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:12.595
but this
preposterous subterfuge...

01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:15.331
is equally culpable
and contemptuous of this court.

01:14:15.405 --> 01:14:18.101
The prisoner will be detained...

01:14:18.174 --> 01:14:20.972
until he has purged himself
of this additional contempt.

01:14:27.784 --> 01:14:28.944
I can see right through you.

01:14:29.019 --> 01:14:32.352
I'm telling the truth.
I haven't got any notes.

01:14:33.423 --> 01:14:34.720
What did you tell him?

01:14:34.791 --> 01:14:36.122
I told you, I didn't
tell him anything.

01:14:36.192 --> 01:14:37.216
I don't know nothin'.

01:14:37.293 --> 01:14:38.726
She knows plenty.
Don't play no...

01:14:38.795 --> 01:14:40.262
Would you shut up!

01:14:42.799 --> 01:14:45.165
I don't want you to go
near that D.A., you understand?

01:14:45.235 --> 01:14:46.964
I don't want to go near him.

01:14:52.809 --> 01:14:54.299
The problem is your pal
the reporter.

01:14:54.377 --> 01:14:57.073
He's in jail,
so he's no problem.

01:15:01.217 --> 01:15:03.082
I've been thinking.

01:15:03.153 --> 01:15:04.950
I'd like to do something else
for a while.

01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:08.755
Oh, really?

01:15:08.825 --> 01:15:11.726
Like what, a brain surgeon
or something?

01:15:12.495 --> 01:15:15.658
Look, you're doing what you do.

01:15:15.732 --> 01:15:17.563
The problem is
you ain't been doing it...

01:15:17.634 --> 01:15:20.432
too swift here of late
'cause of your pal the reporter.

01:15:20.503 --> 01:15:22.835
He's not my pal.

01:15:22.906 --> 01:15:25.500
He thinks he can
hide from me in jail?

01:15:25.575 --> 01:15:27.236
I can reach him anywhere.

01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:32.274
And you trying to play
all sides, just like him.

01:15:32.348 --> 01:15:33.315
No, I'm not!

01:15:35.785 --> 01:15:37.582
What, are you raising
your voice to me now?

01:15:37.654 --> 01:15:39.144
Just leave me alone.

01:15:39.889 --> 01:15:41.481
I told you to shut up!

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.627
What's going on here?

01:15:52.702 --> 01:15:55.193
Are you going to start running
this outfit or something?

01:15:55.271 --> 01:15:58.866
I just wish I could have some
time to figure some stuff out.

01:15:59.709 --> 01:16:02.075
But why now?
I thought that was my job.

01:16:02.145 --> 01:16:03.703
What, are you
changing positions?

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:05.748
Can't you just leave me alone?

01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:09.982
You want me to leave you alone?

01:16:15.825 --> 01:16:17.258
Are you crazy, girl?!

01:16:17.327 --> 01:16:18.954
Sit.

01:16:23.733 --> 01:16:24.961
You bitch.

01:16:26.069 --> 01:16:29.470
You crazy, crazy bitch.

01:16:31.775 --> 01:16:33.402
You got a problem, baby.

01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:37.045
You got a serious problem.

01:16:37.113 --> 01:16:38.205
I'm sorry.

01:16:38.281 --> 01:16:40.215
I think you need to be punished.

01:16:40.283 --> 01:16:41.215
I'm sorry.

01:16:41.284 --> 01:16:43.752
That is what I truly believe.

01:16:45.288 --> 01:16:48.951
I know there ain't enough things
I can do to you...

01:16:49.025 --> 01:16:53.758
but right now, I got a taste for
a little piece of you.

01:16:57.634 --> 01:16:59.067
You're a good
little piece, ain't you?

01:16:59.135 --> 01:17:00.966
Yes, baby. Just for you.

01:17:01.037 --> 01:17:02.971
Just for you.

01:17:03.039 --> 01:17:05.371
But that's not the piece
I want right now.

01:17:13.316 --> 01:17:14.510
I could rip out your nose...

01:17:14.584 --> 01:17:18.748
or I could
snip off your lips.

01:17:18.822 --> 01:17:21.757
But you been looking
where you shouldn't...

01:17:21.825 --> 01:17:24.293
so it's your eyes
that should be punished.

01:17:25.395 --> 01:17:27.989
So I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

01:17:28.064 --> 01:17:29.691
I'm going to take an eye.

01:17:29.766 --> 01:17:32.030
Just one eye.

01:17:32.101 --> 01:17:35.559
You tell me which one
you want me to take.

01:17:37.106 --> 01:17:38.698
The left one?

01:17:38.775 --> 01:17:40.299
You want me to
take the right one?

01:17:41.344 --> 01:17:42.709
What, the left?

01:17:42.779 --> 01:17:44.713
I'm sorry. Please...

01:17:44.781 --> 01:17:46.214
I'm gonna take the left eye.

01:17:46.282 --> 01:17:47.681
- No!
- The right?

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:49.342
The left? Well, which one?

01:17:49.419 --> 01:17:50.443
You want me to take 'em both?

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.488
I don't know!

01:17:52.555 --> 01:17:54.546
You want me to take them both?

01:17:54.624 --> 01:17:56.148
Left! Left!

01:18:45.842 --> 01:18:47.036
Go on. Get out there.

01:18:48.845 --> 01:18:50.870
Do me a good night's work.

01:19:07.096 --> 01:19:09.724
You think that's
going to fix her?

01:19:09.799 --> 01:19:12.165
She's gonna keep on
making trouble.

01:19:42.498 --> 01:19:45.092
You still want to talk?

01:19:45.168 --> 01:19:46.795
You talk, I'll listen.

01:20:18.534 --> 01:20:20.092
A little side business?

01:20:32.482 --> 01:20:33.949
What do you want?

01:20:36.819 --> 01:20:38.343
Punchy's dead.

01:20:38.421 --> 01:20:40.412
What are you talking about?

01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:41.514
I'm talking about she's dead.

01:20:41.591 --> 01:20:44.059
I saw just her at the morgue.

01:20:44.127 --> 01:20:45.287
I don't believe you.

01:20:56.339 --> 01:20:59.274
Now you see what
your principles have done?

01:20:59.342 --> 01:21:02.311
What did I tell you
about him?

01:21:06.516 --> 01:21:08.507
Don't worry. I'll nail him.

01:21:13.756 --> 01:21:16.691
She told me what Fast
wants you to do.

01:21:16.759 --> 01:21:18.090
Don't do it.

01:21:18.161 --> 01:21:19.753
If you tamper with evidence...

01:21:19.829 --> 01:21:22.093
if I even think you're
tampering with evidence...

01:21:22.165 --> 01:21:23.530
I'm gonna put you
so far away...

01:21:23.599 --> 01:21:25.692
you won't even remember
what the streets look like.

01:21:25.768 --> 01:21:27.633
I told you that
I don't have any notes.

01:21:27.703 --> 01:21:28.863
Is that right?

01:21:28.938 --> 01:21:30.735
Is that gonna help
the next one he kills?

01:21:31.607 --> 01:21:33.336
Goddamn fucking asshole!

01:21:34.377 --> 01:21:35.810
I'm telling you!

01:21:35.878 --> 01:21:38.108
Get your hands off me!

01:21:42.051 --> 01:21:43.678
Enjoy yourself here.

01:21:52.061 --> 01:21:53.119
I forgot the apples.

01:21:53.196 --> 01:21:55.528
Would you get me
one of those bags?

01:21:56.732 --> 01:21:59.929
God, people are
so damn rude around here.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.867
Oh, my God!

01:22:06.909 --> 01:22:08.376
What happened?

01:22:11.314 --> 01:22:13.339
Alison, are you all right?

01:22:13.416 --> 01:22:14.348
Can I help you?

01:22:14.417 --> 01:22:15.349
Could you...

01:22:15.418 --> 01:22:16.817
I think we need an ambulance.

01:22:18.254 --> 01:22:19.687
She'll be all right.

01:22:19.755 --> 01:22:22.519
She's got the best doctors,
thanks to Ted.

01:22:22.592 --> 01:22:24.856
You get me out of here.

01:22:24.927 --> 01:22:26.417
Which is it, Jonathan,
do you have notes...

01:22:26.496 --> 01:22:27.724
or don't you have notes?

01:22:29.432 --> 01:22:30.797
I have notes.

01:22:30.867 --> 01:22:31.993
Since when?

01:22:32.068 --> 01:22:33.797
I don't think you know
what you've got.

01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:35.337
Let me tell you something.

01:22:35.404 --> 01:22:36.996
If it wasn't
for my responsibility...

01:22:37.073 --> 01:22:41.032
to Ted and the magazine,
I would not be here.

01:22:42.578 --> 01:22:45.274
You just tell the judge
I'll give him the notes.

01:23:17.446 --> 01:23:18.913
It's all right.

01:23:26.789 --> 01:23:28.256
I love you.

01:23:51.414 --> 01:23:54.872
All right, you win.
I'm ready to talk.

01:23:57.587 --> 01:23:59.885
Well, Mr. Ain't-Got-No-Notes.

01:24:01.257 --> 01:24:02.189
Jail break?

01:24:02.258 --> 01:24:03.816
I said I'm ready to talk.

01:24:09.265 --> 01:24:11.233
Now, ain't that nice?

01:24:16.272 --> 01:24:17.739
Let's find some privacy.

01:24:30.786 --> 01:24:33.277
You're about to get
flushed down the toilet.

01:24:33.356 --> 01:24:35.654
I ought to blow your
brains out right now.

01:24:35.725 --> 01:24:38.319
I'll do what you want,
but nobody else gets hurt.

01:24:38.394 --> 01:24:39.793
You fuckin' "a," man,
'cause if you don't...

01:24:39.862 --> 01:24:41.227
I'm taking you out and
everybody around you.

01:24:41.297 --> 01:24:42.286
Do you understand me?

01:24:42.365 --> 01:24:43.423
Don't threaten me. You need me.

01:24:43.499 --> 01:24:45.160
Fuck you, man!

01:24:45.234 --> 01:24:46.667
I know what you do.

01:24:46.736 --> 01:24:48.465
You scare the shit
out of everybody...

01:24:48.537 --> 01:24:50.664
then you give them a reprieve.

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:52.173
What's the matter?
You don't believe it?

01:24:52.241 --> 01:24:54.801
You don't believe I'll blow
your goddamn brains out?

01:24:54.877 --> 01:24:58.574
You got me scared.
Now you can put it down.

01:24:58.648 --> 01:25:00.309
Do you ever think
about dying, man?

01:25:00.383 --> 01:25:01.816
Do you ever think about it?

01:25:01.884 --> 01:25:03.442
If I'm dead, you're dead.

01:25:03.519 --> 01:25:06.420
You're real good with words,
ain't you?

01:25:06.489 --> 01:25:08.650
You mix 'em up real good.

01:25:08.724 --> 01:25:10.248
But I got your ass now.

01:25:10.326 --> 01:25:12.419
You think about it.

01:25:12.495 --> 01:25:15.521
No notes... you're going away
for a long time.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.831
Why are you giving me
the notes now?

01:25:19.902 --> 01:25:22.462
You know why.

01:25:42.458 --> 01:25:45.393
What you going to say?

01:25:45.461 --> 01:25:47.326
You and me were out in Rockaway
having a hot dog...

01:25:47.396 --> 01:25:50.888
when the guy got took out,
just like we talked about.

01:25:50.966 --> 01:25:53.935
I'll make it look good.
They'll believe me.

01:26:04.814 --> 01:26:05.940
See?

01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:10.118
I told you you could do it.

01:26:16.492 --> 01:26:17.925
Ah, shit, you all right.

01:26:17.993 --> 01:26:19.654
Come on. I'll buy you
a cup of coffee.

01:26:35.778 --> 01:26:38.872
Mr. Smalls, were you
surprised at the acquittal?

01:26:38.948 --> 01:26:39.880
No.

01:26:39.949 --> 01:26:41.211
Absolutely not.

01:26:41.283 --> 01:26:42.716
There never was anything...

01:26:42.785 --> 01:26:45.049
but vague,
circumstantial evidence.

01:26:45.121 --> 01:26:48.113
In this country, a man can
still receive a fair trial...

01:26:48.190 --> 01:26:51.557
no matter what
his race or background.

01:26:51.627 --> 01:26:52.992
Justice has been served.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.233
Just a minute.

01:26:59.301 --> 01:27:01.235
Just a minute, all right?

01:27:01.303 --> 01:27:02.736
Look, I know you lied.

01:27:02.805 --> 01:27:04.102
I don't know what
your deal is with him.

01:27:04.173 --> 01:27:05.470
I don't care.

01:27:05.541 --> 01:27:08.237
Tampering with evidence
is illegal.

01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:10.972
It carries time,
and you're going to do it.

01:27:11.046 --> 01:27:12.980
Let me ask you something.

01:27:13.048 --> 01:27:15.141
What's it going to get you?

01:27:15.217 --> 01:27:16.445
Satisfaction.

01:27:26.162 --> 01:27:27.390
Over here. Come here.

01:27:28.664 --> 01:27:30.564
Why don't you go on?

01:27:38.441 --> 01:27:39.601
How you doing?

01:27:39.675 --> 01:27:41.108
How come you're not
working tonight?

01:27:41.177 --> 01:27:43.270
I could start right now.

01:27:43.345 --> 01:27:44.277
It's OK.

01:27:44.346 --> 01:27:46.473
I want you do me a little favor.

01:27:46.549 --> 01:27:47.880
It depends.

01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:49.383
Reggie's in there.

01:27:49.452 --> 01:27:51.750
I got two hundred bucks.
You give it to him.

01:27:51.821 --> 01:27:55.120
But you tell him
it's from Fast. Got that?

01:27:55.191 --> 01:27:56.283
I don't know about this.

01:27:56.358 --> 01:27:57.450
I don't want Fast on my case.

01:27:57.526 --> 01:27:59.357
Why don't you give it
to him yourself?

01:27:59.428 --> 01:28:01.828
Listen, I think
you owe me one.

01:28:06.101 --> 01:28:08.865
All right,
but this is it. We're even.

01:28:08.938 --> 01:28:10.667
Thanks a lot.

01:28:16.545 --> 01:28:17.807
All right, Steve, roll it.

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:33.654
Get in close.

01:28:33.729 --> 01:28:35.663
Make sure you see the money.

01:28:35.731 --> 01:28:37.198
I'm right on the money.

01:28:43.405 --> 01:28:44.497
And when he comes out...

01:28:44.573 --> 01:28:46.097
you rewind and get ready
to drive.

01:28:46.175 --> 01:28:47.733
You got it.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:07.285
Well, Mr. TV.

01:29:07.363 --> 01:29:09.558
You're starting to
like it up here, huh?

01:29:10.232 --> 01:29:12.132
I want to show you something.

01:29:16.105 --> 01:29:18.573
Hop in. Take a look around.

01:29:20.943 --> 01:29:22.069
Hey, man, this is slick.

01:29:23.779 --> 01:29:24.837
Watch this.

01:29:26.949 --> 01:29:27.881
Look at that.

01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:29.645
I'm on TV.

01:29:29.718 --> 01:29:31.015
You know what that is, Reg?

01:29:31.086 --> 01:29:32.110
That's a picture
of you taking money...

01:29:32.187 --> 01:29:34.155
from one of Fast's girls.

01:29:34.223 --> 01:29:35.190
So what?

01:29:35.257 --> 01:29:36.656
Use your brain, Reggie.

01:29:36.725 --> 01:29:39.091
Looks to me like you're going
into business for yourself.

01:29:43.232 --> 01:29:45.063
I know what you did,
God damn it!

01:29:45.134 --> 01:29:47.159
I can't prove it,
but I know you cut Alison.

01:29:47.236 --> 01:29:48.703
I'm going to get you.

01:29:48.771 --> 01:29:50.796
I'm going to show that tape
to Fast in about 15 minutes.

01:29:50.873 --> 01:29:52.431
You can't do that.
He's gonna kill me.

01:29:52.508 --> 01:29:54.942
Looks like you got
a little problem.

01:29:56.712 --> 01:29:58.339
Don't be stupid, Reggie.

01:29:58.414 --> 01:30:00.177
Don't be stupid.

01:30:01.717 --> 01:30:03.685
You better start running.

01:30:08.490 --> 01:30:11.050
Nobody likes
to have their car towed.

01:30:11.126 --> 01:30:12.923
It's expensive and inconvenient.

01:30:12.995 --> 01:30:14.860
We like it even less
when cameras or tape decks...

01:30:14.930 --> 01:30:17.330
disappear along with the car.

01:30:17.399 --> 01:30:20.027
In answer to viewer complaints
about lost items...

01:30:20.102 --> 01:30:21.865
we left a radio
in the front seat...

01:30:21.937 --> 01:30:23.666
of an illegally parked car.

01:30:26.075 --> 01:30:28.270
Look at my man.
Look at him.

01:30:33.215 --> 01:30:35.740
Put that down.
That's private property.

01:30:35.818 --> 01:30:37.479
That's right,
I'm talking to you.

01:30:37.553 --> 01:30:38.781
You're on TV.

01:30:38.854 --> 01:30:41.948
Everybody is watching you.
Put the radio down.

01:30:42.024 --> 01:30:44.652
Get out of the car
and shut the door.

01:30:47.896 --> 01:30:51.059
Walk to your truck
and drive away.

01:30:52.568 --> 01:30:55.662
This is Jonathan Fisher,
Channel 3, "Street Smart."

01:30:55.738 --> 01:30:56.966
That's my man.

01:30:58.007 --> 01:30:59.497
Hey, Fast!

01:30:59.575 --> 01:31:01.406
Move your car.
You got me blocked.

01:31:01.477 --> 01:31:03.104
- What?
- Move your car.

01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:06.314
Wait a minute.

01:31:06.382 --> 01:31:07.815
Move my car?

01:31:07.883 --> 01:31:09.316
I can't get out.

01:31:11.053 --> 01:31:12.020
God damn.

01:31:13.222 --> 01:31:14.951
Christine,
you ain't seen Reggie?

01:31:15.024 --> 01:31:16.685
He ain't been around.

01:31:19.561 --> 01:31:20.687
Right. He come in here...

01:31:20.763 --> 01:31:22.321
you tell him
I'm looking for his ass.

01:31:25.567 --> 01:31:27.057
You want a cup of coffee?

01:31:59.635 --> 01:32:00.966
Hey, man, you gone crazy?

01:32:03.605 --> 01:32:05.197
Reggie, what the hell you...

01:32:45.881 --> 01:32:49.112
Tonight on a Harlem
back street, Leo Smalls, Jr...

01:32:49.184 --> 01:32:51.049
a street pimp
known as "Fast Black"...

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:53.179
was allegedly gunned down
by a suspect...

01:32:53.255 --> 01:32:56.122
police have identified
as Reginald Liggens.

01:32:56.191 --> 01:32:58.819
Liggens, twenty,
described as an employee...

01:32:58.894 --> 01:33:01.556
was apprehended a few blocks
from the murder scene.

01:33:01.630 --> 01:33:03.154
Smalls had recently
been acquitted...

01:33:03.232 --> 01:33:06.599
of a Times Square murder
in a controversial case.

01:33:09.738 --> 01:33:11.171
In the streets
of this neighborhood...

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:12.502
the justice meted out...

01:33:12.574 --> 01:33:14.667
isn't always the kind
that's taught in school.

01:33:14.743 --> 01:33:17.837
Tonight, the court of the street
found a man guilty...

01:33:17.913 --> 01:33:19.505
where a court of law didn't.

01:33:19.581 --> 01:33:20.843
For Leo Smalls, Jr...

01:33:20.916 --> 01:33:22.713
a man who trafficked
in death and violence...

01:33:22.785 --> 01:33:26.380
the punishment dealt out tonight
was both fitting and absolute.

01:33:26.455 --> 01:33:29.185
This is Jonathan Fisher,
Channel 3...
