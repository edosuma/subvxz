03:44.520 --> 03:46.710
We're riding towards Absolution.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.160
You know how far west we are?

03:57.970 --> 03:59.700
Maybe he's a dummy.

04:00.270 --> 04:03.200
Is there a reason
you're not answering my question?

04:03.970 --> 04:07.030
Look here, Pa.
He's got iron on his wrist.

04:07.140 --> 04:09.170
He's been shot.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.770
Could be he done
broke out of the hoosegow.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.240
Might be worth bounty money.

04:13.350 --> 04:14.870
Might could be.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.450
It's not your lucky day, stranger.

04:26.890 --> 04:28.160
Turn around and start walking.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.560
I said turn around and start walking!

07:23.840 --> 07:25.140
Get out.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.500
Hello?

08:57.160 --> 08:59.390
Palms to heaven, friend.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.730
Easy now.

09:08.110 --> 09:12.170
All right. Turn around, nice and slow.

09:12.650 --> 09:14.140
I've been shot.

09:21.020 --> 09:24.580
Only two kinds of men get shot,
criminals and victims.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.930
Which one are you?

09:29.460 --> 09:30.690
I don't know.

09:31.170 --> 09:32.690
You got a name, friend?

09:34.040 --> 09:35.870
I don't know that either.

09:36.540 --> 09:38.130
Just what do you know?

09:39.470 --> 09:40.840
English.

09:48.450 --> 09:52.220
Well, that is a right odd-looking
wound there.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.250
Looks almost cauterized.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.790
All right, this might sting a bit.

10:02.800 --> 10:03.920
Is this a mining town?

10:06.970 --> 10:10.600
Yeah. Well, that was the notion.

10:11.740 --> 10:15.680
People moved on, though. No gold.

10:15.810 --> 10:17.970
All right now, try and hold still.

10:21.650 --> 10:23.140
There we go.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.520
This is no gunshot.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.550
Where'd you get this, son?

10:28.660 --> 10:30.090
I don't know.

10:30.190 --> 10:34.220
I can't rightly absolve you of your sins
if you don't recall 'em, can I?

10:34.760 --> 10:38.490
That being said,
I've seen good men do bad things

10:38.600 --> 10:40.900
and bad men do good things.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.570
Whether you're gonna
end up in heaven or hell,

10:44.670 --> 10:47.300
it's not God's plan, it's your own.

10:48.110 --> 10:50.740
You just got to remember what it was.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.780
All right, put me a finger right here.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.070
Come on.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.810
There you go.

11:00.290 --> 11:01.620
There.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.050
Thank you.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.130
Not bad for a country preacher.

11:12.930 --> 11:14.960
It's that damn fool Dolarhyde kid.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.700
Hey! What are you doing?

11:18.810 --> 11:20.900
What are you doing, Percy?
There's people up there!

11:21.010 --> 11:22.500
There's no one up there. It's fine.

11:22.610 --> 11:24.840
It's not fine.
It's bad enough he drinks for free.

11:24.950 --> 11:27.110
Now he's got to shoot up the place?

11:27.210 --> 11:28.440
Wait, what was that, Doc?

11:28.550 --> 11:30.520
Nothing. He didn't say anything.
Everything's okay.

11:30.620 --> 11:31.880
Please go back inside.

11:32.020 --> 11:33.110
Shut up.

11:35.290 --> 11:39.160
I want to hear what you said.
"It's bad enough" what?

11:41.060 --> 11:43.660
You ungrateful for our business?

11:44.130 --> 11:46.290
'Cause if it wasn't for my pa's cattle,

11:46.400 --> 11:48.490
there'd be no money
going through this town!

11:48.600 --> 11:53.270
There'd be no meat on your tables!
And your doors would be closed!

11:55.440 --> 11:57.970
I don't mean no disrespect
to your father, Percy. You know that.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.740
Of course not.
But you ask me to pay.

12:03.780 --> 12:04.880
Come here, let's settle up.

12:06.850 --> 12:08.120
Come here.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.930
Hey.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.390
Hey, kid, I don't want any trouble.
I'm just trying to...

12:20.530 --> 12:24.940
Better pick up your glasses, Doc,
before someone steps on them.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.210
Stop!

12:32.310 --> 12:33.710
I'll pay the goddamn bill!

12:34.010 --> 12:38.680
All right, son! We're just trying
to make a living now. Come on.

12:38.790 --> 12:42.520
You know what, preacher?
You just gave me an idea.

12:42.860 --> 12:45.350
I know it ain't Sunday, folks,

12:45.490 --> 12:48.990
but what say we take up
a collection for the poor man?

12:50.560 --> 12:52.330
Now, who's got money?

12:53.400 --> 12:54.770
In the hat.

12:56.070 --> 12:57.590
Let's go.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.330
Much obliged.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.430
Now, I'm sorry Doc's bad fortune

13:01.540 --> 13:04.200
has to be taken out on you good people.
In the hat.

13:05.310 --> 13:07.250
That's mighty Christian of you.

13:11.650 --> 13:12.620
Hey.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.290
You, too.

13:16.760 --> 13:20.250
You want to be careful where you point
that thing before you get hurt.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.270
Listen...

13:30.740 --> 13:35.540
I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt, because

13:36.580 --> 13:38.880
maybe you don't know who I am.

13:52.130 --> 13:54.290
- Come on.
- Get off of me!

13:54.400 --> 13:55.690
Hey, you!

13:57.900 --> 13:59.460
I'm warning you.

14:11.610 --> 14:13.170
Are you all right?

14:13.280 --> 14:14.770
Where the hell did he come from?

14:14.880 --> 14:17.750
Where the hell did he come from?

14:17.850 --> 14:19.840
What the hell is going on here?

14:21.260 --> 14:24.780
It was an accident.
He came out of nowhere.

14:24.890 --> 14:28.850
And he dry-gulched me.
He tried to make me look like a fool.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.760
It wasn't my fault, Sheriff.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.560
Damn it, Percy. You crossed the line
this time. I gotta lock you up.

14:34.670 --> 14:35.900
Taggart.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.900
You know that's not a good idea.

14:39.510 --> 14:42.500
Well, I'm afraid I got no choice, Nat.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.040
Nat?

14:46.810 --> 14:49.410
Nat, you son of a bitch,
where you going?

14:49.520 --> 14:54.540
Don't worry. I'll tell your father
about what happened today.

14:58.830 --> 15:01.020
You burned the coffee again, Mickey.

15:01.130 --> 15:04.360
Well. Tell you what, Ed.
Next time, you can make the coffee.

15:04.470 --> 15:05.560
- Okay.
- All right.

15:05.670 --> 15:08.070
Why don't you take it easy
on that Taos Lightnin', Murphy?

15:08.170 --> 15:10.300
Mr. Dolarhyde
don't like drinking on the job.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.810
Mr. Dolarhyde
don't like drinking on the job?

15:15.680 --> 15:20.640
I don't give a rat's ass what the high
and mighty Colonel Dolarhyde don't like!

15:21.350 --> 15:24.810
I don't care how many Indians
he put under neither.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.620
You sure do flap your gums a lot
when the boss ain't around.

15:32.690 --> 15:35.390
I'd say it to his face if he was here!

15:36.400 --> 15:38.370
Colonel Dolarhyde.

15:44.370 --> 15:47.340
I'm gonna tell you something, boys.

15:49.180 --> 15:51.300
Money makes you soft.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.880
Where the hell's that coach?

16:30.680 --> 16:32.410
Coach? What coach?

16:32.520 --> 16:34.490
You shot a deputy, Percy.

16:35.090 --> 16:37.580
Federal Marshal's
bringing you to Santa Fe.

16:37.690 --> 16:39.420
Federal Marshal?

16:39.530 --> 16:41.890
Sheriff, have you lost your mind?

16:42.600 --> 16:44.790
My pa is on his way down here.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.990
You better let me out of here
before things get out of hand.

16:48.700 --> 16:53.800
Sheriff, it was an accident!
It's not like I'm Jesse James!

16:54.040 --> 16:55.570
Son of a bitch.

16:57.980 --> 17:00.610
Could you put that on Percy's tab?

17:01.880 --> 17:03.510
Fifty cents.

17:04.280 --> 17:05.839
Just kidding with you, there, Doc.

17:10.060 --> 17:12.359
I got no respect in this town.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.089
That's not true, okay?

17:15.460 --> 17:16.790
You want to leave?

17:16.900 --> 17:20.630
No. This is your dream.
I'd follow you anywhere.

17:20.730 --> 17:21.960
I thought it was our dream.

17:24.069 --> 17:25.800
God damn it!

17:25.910 --> 17:28.099
Hey, Charlie,
why don't you play something festive?

17:28.210 --> 17:30.340
It's like a funeral in here!

17:36.250 --> 17:39.480
Hey, you don't have
to prove anything, okay?

17:39.590 --> 17:41.820
Okay? I love you.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.510
I'm not a child.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.670
Whiskey.

18:04.510 --> 18:07.040
On the house, for what you did.

18:26.470 --> 18:28.260
I'm just here to drink.

18:33.810 --> 18:36.000
- Do I know you?
- No.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.250
My name's Ella.

18:46.490 --> 18:48.960
Where'd you get your bracelet?

18:51.160 --> 18:54.420
There something you know about me,
lady?

18:55.730 --> 18:58.160
You don't remember anything, do you?

19:01.840 --> 19:03.740
What do you want?

19:03.840 --> 19:06.430
I know you're looking for something.

19:06.540 --> 19:07.840
So am I.

19:10.680 --> 19:11.800
Well, good luck to you.

19:20.820 --> 19:21.850
Move away.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.460
Jake Lonergan.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.490
You mind following me
over to the office,

19:54.590 --> 19:56.520
so we can have us a little chat?

19:59.930 --> 20:02.230
I think you've got the wrong man.

20:04.770 --> 20:07.560
Well, I'm gonna need you
to come with us all the same.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.570
Wouldn't do that if I was you.

20:40.070 --> 20:41.300
No!

20:44.570 --> 20:46.540
I don't want any trouble.

21:30.050 --> 21:31.750
Rise and shine.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.010
You're in trouble now.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.250
You're gonna burn.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.490
My pa is coming for me.

21:43.260 --> 21:48.530
He learned how to kill a man
good and slow in the war.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.570
I am going to watch you suffer

21:51.670 --> 21:54.000
for a long,

21:54.110 --> 21:55.570
long,

21:55.680 --> 21:57.840
long time.

21:59.380 --> 22:03.680
You thought
that cheap shot in the pecker hurt?

22:12.160 --> 22:15.130
Please! I didn't kill your cattle.

22:16.060 --> 22:19.030
Colonel Dolarhyde.
You got to believe me!

22:21.500 --> 22:25.130
You only been riding for my brand
for what, two weeks?

22:27.340 --> 22:30.500
You don't maybe know
who you're dealing with, Roy.

22:34.350 --> 22:36.480
Nobody calls me "Colonel."

22:37.680 --> 22:40.080
Them that did are mostly dead.

22:43.790 --> 22:45.090
Please.

22:47.030 --> 22:50.830
So you, Ed and Little Mickey is picking
up strays. How many did you get?

22:51.200 --> 22:53.360
Got 24 of 'em, boss.

22:53.470 --> 22:56.030
You been drinking, ain't you?
I can smell it on you.

22:56.140 --> 22:59.260
I haven't been drinking none.
It's them other two's that drinked.

22:59.640 --> 23:03.940
What kind of a man goes around
blowing up other people's cows

23:04.040 --> 23:08.540
then tells a bullshit story like this?
You couldn't do no better?

23:08.650 --> 23:11.080
You got to believe me.
There was white lights!

23:11.220 --> 23:12.550
There was bright lights!

23:12.650 --> 23:16.610
So there was this big light,
and you fell in the river

23:16.720 --> 23:18.160
and when you come back,

23:18.260 --> 23:20.850
two of my best hands
has just disappeared.

23:23.160 --> 23:27.960
There weren't no storm.
There weren't no lightning this evening.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.130
You don't respect me, do you, Roy?

23:30.240 --> 23:31.300
Boss!

23:34.840 --> 23:36.600
Where's Percy?

23:36.710 --> 23:38.540
Taggart locked him up, boss.

23:38.650 --> 23:41.340
Why? What'd he do now?

23:41.750 --> 23:43.270
Shot a deputy.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.210
God damn it!

23:45.320 --> 23:48.150
What the hell
does Taggart think he's doing?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.310
He wouldn't even have a job if I...

23:50.420 --> 23:53.420
Now I got to go in there
and reason with him!

23:53.530 --> 23:56.500
'Cause you failed to look after my boy!

24:01.030 --> 24:03.160
Thank you. Thank you.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.000
All right. Everybody, saddle up.

24:12.980 --> 24:15.610
Boss, we ought to get more hands.

24:15.720 --> 24:16.770
Why?

24:16.880 --> 24:21.120
You're not gonna believe this,
but I think Jake Lonergan's in town.

24:32.570 --> 24:35.260
I'm turning you over
to the Federal Marshal.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.030
You're gonna tell me
what I am charged with?

24:41.740 --> 24:44.470
Arson. Assault.

24:44.580 --> 24:46.670
Mayhem. Hijacking.

24:48.980 --> 24:53.480
It says you robbed the stage last month
with Pat Dolan and Bull McCade.

24:54.150 --> 24:56.880
Which makes you
accessory to every law they broke, too.

25:03.230 --> 25:04.290
That it?

25:05.170 --> 25:06.630
Murder.

25:07.770 --> 25:11.070
Prostitute out of Cottonwood Grove,
next county over.

25:11.170 --> 25:13.140
Name of Alice Wills.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.440
You saying I killed this woman?

25:17.780 --> 25:19.540
You tell me.

26:03.820 --> 26:05.090
Damn.

26:09.100 --> 26:10.080
Give me your wrist.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.760
Taggart, what are you doing?

26:14.330 --> 26:15.360
Sheriff.

26:16.540 --> 26:19.000
Sheriff, this is going too far.

26:19.970 --> 26:21.340
I was just fooling around.

26:23.310 --> 26:25.370
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

26:25.810 --> 26:27.010
Go away.

26:27.110 --> 26:31.110
Listen, I'm sorry, but I had no choice.
I couldn't let you leave.

26:31.220 --> 26:33.240
Well, I'm leaving now.

26:33.890 --> 26:35.120
I need you.

26:35.220 --> 26:37.280
You got something to say, say it.

26:38.830 --> 26:41.320
I need to know where you came from.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.660
So do I.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.170
Ma'am.

26:53.170 --> 26:55.140
You two lovebirds have a nice trip now.

26:57.740 --> 27:00.710
Taggart! Taggart, let me out of here!

27:01.410 --> 27:02.610
Sheriff!

27:03.680 --> 27:04.950
Sheriff!

27:05.790 --> 27:06.810
What are you doing?

27:08.890 --> 27:10.720
You get back home. Go to bed.

27:10.820 --> 27:12.790
Please don't go.

27:12.890 --> 27:15.790
I have to, Emmett. It's my job.

27:16.130 --> 27:17.690
I don't like it here.

27:18.500 --> 27:21.470
Your pa's getting things in order.
When he does he'll send for you.

27:22.070 --> 27:23.370
It's been a year.

27:24.470 --> 27:25.870
Don't worry, he will.

27:27.810 --> 27:29.780
And your mom's buried here.

27:30.740 --> 27:32.370
You know I can't leave my little girl.

27:40.420 --> 27:42.550
- Taggart?
- Yeah, I see them.

27:43.420 --> 27:45.890
Emmett, you go inside. Now.

28:05.410 --> 28:07.470
I want my boy, John.

28:07.580 --> 28:08.710
Pa?

28:09.220 --> 28:10.610
Pa!

28:13.850 --> 28:15.340
I knew you'd come for me, Pa.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.620
Shut up! I'll deal with you later.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.620
Yeah, that's Lonergan, boss.

28:26.700 --> 28:30.190
That's the son of a bitch
stole my gold off the bullion coach.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.670
I want that man.

28:31.770 --> 28:34.210
You're gonna have to take it up
with the judge in Santa Fe.

28:34.310 --> 28:36.070
I ain't going to Santa Fe.

28:36.180 --> 28:38.110
You give him to me now

28:38.210 --> 28:39.940
or I'm gonna take him.

28:40.050 --> 28:41.380
What about me, Pa?

28:41.480 --> 28:43.140
I said, shut up, boy!

29:21.890 --> 29:23.450
What the hell is that?

29:43.380 --> 29:45.000
What the hell?

30:06.100 --> 30:07.070
Hey!

30:29.060 --> 30:30.550
- They're coming back!
- They're coming around again.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.280
They're coming back! Dismount!

30:44.670 --> 30:45.660
- Get out of the way!
- Maria!

30:46.070 --> 30:47.370
Oh, God!

30:47.870 --> 30:49.360
Don't move! Don't move!

30:49.480 --> 30:52.210
Stay there! Stay right there!
Don't move! I'm coming!

31:02.590 --> 31:04.020
Give me your hand.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.820
- Give me your hand.
- What the hell for?

31:05.930 --> 31:08.590
I can get us free.
Just give me your hand.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.790
Hold still.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.540
Emmett!

31:24.110 --> 31:25.100
Grandpa!

31:27.880 --> 31:28.870
Emmett!

31:29.720 --> 31:31.180
Emmett, it's all right. I got you, son.

31:38.290 --> 31:40.320
- Give me your hand.
- No!

31:40.430 --> 31:42.450
Come on, kid. Give me your hand!

31:58.140 --> 31:59.700
What is that?

32:27.740 --> 32:30.570
Come on, get up, boss.
Come on, we got to get out of here.

32:30.980 --> 32:32.100
Where's Percy?

32:35.920 --> 32:37.010
Come on out of there!

32:38.020 --> 32:40.750
- I can't, Pa.
- You can't? Coward!

32:41.720 --> 32:44.850
He broke my fingers!

32:50.300 --> 32:51.420
Pa!

32:51.970 --> 32:53.160
Pa!

32:55.470 --> 32:57.200
Let's go! We got to go!

32:59.140 --> 33:00.440
This way!

34:57.720 --> 35:00.660
- What is that thing?
- Why are you asking me?

35:00.760 --> 35:02.560
Because you shot it!

35:03.560 --> 35:05.000
With that thing.
Where'd you get that thing?

35:05.100 --> 35:07.360
I don't know.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.060
What do you mean, you don't know?

35:16.610 --> 35:18.630
What the hell is that?

35:20.580 --> 35:22.210
They took my wife.

35:26.250 --> 35:27.740
Hey.

35:27.850 --> 35:29.340
Is anyone in there?

35:30.760 --> 35:31.880
No.

35:31.990 --> 35:33.460
Is my wife in there?

35:33.560 --> 35:34.860
No!

35:34.960 --> 35:36.590
Is it dead?

35:46.070 --> 35:48.870
- Is it demons?
- Demons?

35:49.010 --> 35:52.000
I can't rightly say.
Sure does fit the description, but...

35:52.110 --> 35:54.100
Demons? What are you talking about?

35:54.210 --> 35:55.770
You talking about Bible stuff? Demons?

35:55.880 --> 35:58.180
- I'm not talking about anything.
- What the hell are you talking about?

35:58.280 --> 35:59.340
You got to calm down, Doc.

35:59.450 --> 36:00.440
- Calm down?
- You're scaring the boy.

36:00.550 --> 36:02.780
You're telling me a bunch of demons
took my wife.

36:02.890 --> 36:04.790
- I didn't say any such thing.
- Took our people!

36:04.890 --> 36:06.450
- Get a hold of yourself.
- You're telling me to calm down!

36:29.450 --> 36:31.250
Boss!

36:31.350 --> 36:33.010
Boss!

36:33.120 --> 36:34.680
It went this way.

36:38.390 --> 36:41.420
I don't know what it is, but it's bleeding.

36:43.900 --> 36:47.630
That's the same direction
those machines went with our kin.

36:48.130 --> 36:51.430
We ain't gonna be able to track it
in the dark.

36:52.810 --> 36:54.640
Round up the horses,
get some supplies!

36:54.740 --> 36:56.570
We'll set off at first light!

36:57.780 --> 36:58.900
You.

37:00.650 --> 37:02.610
You're going with us.

37:03.320 --> 37:08.280
I need that weapon. It's the only thing
that counts. And I figure you owe me.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.050
I don't see it that way.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.230
What do you want?

38:24.900 --> 38:26.560
What do you want?

38:27.670 --> 38:30.070
You come clean right now, or I'll kill you.

38:30.170 --> 38:34.200
They took my people, too.
I've been looking for them a long time.

38:35.070 --> 38:36.630
I know you can help me find them.

38:40.250 --> 38:42.150
You stay away from me.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.560
I can help you!

39:02.870 --> 39:04.700
It's heading north.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.970
Its tracks are still fresh.

39:20.690 --> 39:22.920
If it's all the same,
I'd like to ride along, too.

39:23.020 --> 39:24.350
Yes, ma'am.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.650
Got a kid and a dog, why not a woman?

40:15.170 --> 40:16.540
You're back.

40:32.690 --> 40:33.990
What's that?

40:50.840 --> 40:52.540
You have to take it back.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.370
Like hell I will.

40:54.780 --> 40:56.080
That's blood money.

40:56.180 --> 40:58.910
- Well, I goddamned earned it.
- By robbing and killing.

40:59.020 --> 41:01.080
That's gonna get us what we need!

41:33.490 --> 41:34.950
- Jake!
- Stay there!

41:35.050 --> 41:36.250
Jake!

42:08.450 --> 42:10.320
Well, well, well.

42:10.420 --> 42:12.220
Look who's back.

42:12.730 --> 42:15.490
I see you, but I don't see my gold.

42:15.590 --> 42:18.690
Let's say we find those people first,

42:18.800 --> 42:20.960
and then you can take your best shot
at collecting.

42:21.070 --> 42:25.370
Maybe that reward on your head
would be a more attractive proposition.

42:25.470 --> 42:30.100
Or I could just shoot you in the chest
and cut that thing off your arm.

42:31.040 --> 42:34.480
You know, Doc,
I don't even know why we're doing this.

42:34.580 --> 42:36.570
You know they're all dead.

42:37.750 --> 42:40.950
Well, I think if they wanted to kill them,
I think they would have.

42:41.050 --> 42:45.080
Only if the boss is right
and they was roping them.

42:45.930 --> 42:47.420
Bet it's to eat them.

42:49.190 --> 42:51.960
If it was me, I'd start with your wife.

42:54.430 --> 42:57.100
You gonna be like this the whole trip?
'Cause if you are,

42:57.200 --> 43:00.000
we ain't gonna have
too many long conversations, are we?

43:00.110 --> 43:02.670
Why don't you sing a song
or something?

43:02.780 --> 43:05.400
Cook some beans.
Do something useful.

43:15.120 --> 43:17.320
Take some friendly advice?

43:18.560 --> 43:21.620
Get yourself a gun
and learn how to use it.

43:29.700 --> 43:31.830
The tracks are washed away.

44:01.730 --> 44:06.340
I don't know much about boats,
but I'd say that one's upside-down.

44:07.510 --> 44:11.670
We're 500 miles from any river
big enough to hold it.

44:11.780 --> 44:14.080
Well, let's get inside, get out of the rain!

44:14.180 --> 44:16.010
I'm not going anywhere near that thing.

44:16.120 --> 44:18.580
Suit yourself. Sleep in the rain.

44:49.380 --> 44:51.470
You fixin' to say something?

44:52.850 --> 44:54.150
Maybe...

44:55.050 --> 44:57.450
Maybe we should have
called in the Army?

44:57.560 --> 45:00.050
I ain't gonna turn this over
to no West Pointers

45:00.160 --> 45:04.530
who got to get on the telegraph to ask
Washington which hand to wipe with.

45:04.630 --> 45:08.230
I waited around at Antietam
for 'em to tell me what to do.

45:10.140 --> 45:12.760
And lost 328 men

45:13.570 --> 45:15.370
over a cornfield.

45:16.910 --> 45:19.210
I remember those stories.

45:22.250 --> 45:25.050
I don't recollect telling you any stories.

45:25.980 --> 45:29.940
I'd listen when you'd tell them to Percy.

45:30.790 --> 45:34.420
You get this through
your thick Indian skull.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.200
Them stories weren't for you.

45:41.900 --> 45:43.930
They were for my son.

45:47.340 --> 45:52.540
Get out of here.
Go look after the horses. Do your job.

46:31.680 --> 46:34.620
You've been looking at this knife.
You like this knife?

46:48.370 --> 46:50.160
You look after that.

46:52.370 --> 46:53.670
Don't lose it.

47:02.710 --> 47:05.620
Don't yank on it, it's not your pecker.
Now, here.

47:05.720 --> 47:08.620
You're holding onto this thing
like you're hanging from it.

47:13.390 --> 47:15.520
What the hell am I doing?

47:17.960 --> 47:19.660
It's my fault she got took.

47:19.770 --> 47:21.430
I never should have
taken her to that town.

47:21.570 --> 47:23.500
No, no, no. Not your fault.

47:23.600 --> 47:26.040
You'll get her back.
You're setting things right.

47:26.140 --> 47:27.870
Just got to have faith. That's all.

47:27.970 --> 47:31.700
Faith. Yeah.
God's been real swell to me.

47:31.810 --> 47:33.470
I don't mean no disrespect, preacher,

47:33.580 --> 47:37.110
but either he ain't up there,
or he don't like me very much.

47:37.220 --> 47:40.950
Surely you don't expect the Lord
to do everything for you, do you, Doc?

47:42.490 --> 47:44.890
You got to earn his presence.

47:44.990 --> 47:48.550
Then you got to recognize it,
and then you have to act on it.

47:50.430 --> 47:51.900
Now, keep your eye on the target.

47:54.170 --> 47:55.460
And shoot.

48:01.670 --> 48:05.400
That's better. Better.
Come on. Let's reload.

48:27.370 --> 48:29.160
You been there long?

48:29.670 --> 48:30.970
Yes.

48:41.880 --> 48:43.510
There something you need?

48:44.380 --> 48:45.850
Who is she?

48:49.220 --> 48:51.620
She's the only one who knows who I am.

48:51.720 --> 48:53.850
No, you know who you are.

48:54.560 --> 48:57.190
- You just have to remember.
- Well, I can't.

48:57.300 --> 48:58.920
Yes, you can.

49:14.580 --> 49:16.050
Does it hurt?

49:19.580 --> 49:21.280
It's fine.

49:28.930 --> 49:30.050
It's here.

50:08.600 --> 50:10.860
Easy, hey! Easy!

50:10.970 --> 50:12.370
What's wrong, boy?

50:13.110 --> 50:14.570
Hello?

51:42.090 --> 51:43.860
Get away from that boy!

51:48.100 --> 51:49.070
No!

52:17.430 --> 52:20.960
- The boy. The boy.
- He's fine. He's fine.

52:21.730 --> 52:23.530
It's okay. It's okay.

52:27.310 --> 52:29.930
You go get our people back.

52:31.980 --> 52:34.500
God don't care who you were, son.

52:35.080 --> 52:37.140
Only who you are.

53:06.680 --> 53:07.980
Dog?

53:09.280 --> 53:10.370
Come on, boy!

53:12.780 --> 53:14.480
Where are you?

53:16.450 --> 53:19.790
Tracks are good. It's headed north.
Where's the men?

53:19.890 --> 53:22.620
They run off. Goddamn cowards.

53:22.730 --> 53:24.290
I can't find the dog.

53:24.400 --> 53:28.060
We ain't waiting for him.
He's run off or dead. Let's go.

53:28.170 --> 53:29.360
Hey. Hey. Wait.

53:29.470 --> 53:31.960
Aren't we gonna
say some words over him?

53:32.070 --> 53:35.130
Only one who knows what to say
is in the ground.

53:35.240 --> 53:37.640
Ain't it enough we took the time
to put him there?

53:37.740 --> 53:39.940
No. No, it's not enough.

53:51.860 --> 53:53.480
You go ahead.

53:57.860 --> 53:59.160
Lord...

54:02.200 --> 54:06.190
If there is such a thing as a soul
this man had a good one.

54:06.340 --> 54:07.430
Please protect it.

54:08.170 --> 54:09.800
Made me feel better.

54:09.910 --> 54:12.270
World was a better place
for having him.

54:12.380 --> 54:15.040
Dust to dust, amen. How was that?

54:15.150 --> 54:16.550
Good words.

54:27.230 --> 54:29.660
What are you all choked up about?

54:31.560 --> 54:33.960
I'm worried about my grandpa.

54:38.900 --> 54:43.310
Look. When I was only just
a little bit older than you are now

54:43.410 --> 54:45.540
all this was Mexico.

54:47.110 --> 54:52.410
Word come that the Apaches was riding
towards a settlement called Arivaca.

54:54.520 --> 54:56.380
My father wanted me to be a man,

54:56.490 --> 55:00.250
so he made me ride out with
the garrison, banging on a drum.

55:02.690 --> 55:04.660
Boy, was I scared.

55:07.530 --> 55:10.130
Well, we got there, it was too late.
They were all dead,

55:10.240 --> 55:12.430
the place was all burnt down.

55:13.410 --> 55:15.700
This one settler fella

55:16.570 --> 55:19.540
came crawling out of a burning cabin.

55:21.250 --> 55:22.710
He was bad.

55:23.680 --> 55:25.780
He knew he was gonna die.

55:26.920 --> 55:28.650
Burnt bad.

55:31.020 --> 55:32.650
He rolled over,

55:33.630 --> 55:35.750
looked up into my eyes,

55:37.100 --> 55:39.390
and he said, "Kill me."

55:42.270 --> 55:43.930
What did you do?

55:49.270 --> 55:51.870
I took this knife off his belt

55:52.610 --> 55:54.580
and I slit his throat.

55:57.050 --> 55:58.350
Take it.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.710
Be a man.

56:12.800 --> 56:15.100
That's a little rough, isn't it?

56:15.900 --> 56:17.530
He means well.

56:32.250 --> 56:35.810
I got him.
The tracks are closer together.

56:35.920 --> 56:37.850
He's slowing down,
headed to that canyon.

56:59.940 --> 57:02.170
Put your hands up in the air!

57:04.780 --> 57:07.340
That means you, too, pretty lady.

57:09.220 --> 57:11.620
This is what they call a hold-up.

57:11.720 --> 57:15.250
Welcome, everybody. Welcome.

57:19.300 --> 57:20.360
Boss?

57:21.970 --> 57:23.590
Boss, is that you?

57:25.140 --> 57:26.730
Lonergan?

57:27.140 --> 57:29.700
What in the hell are you doing here?

57:33.480 --> 57:36.210
Who are your amigos?

57:38.480 --> 57:40.880
Is this your new gang, Jake?

57:44.490 --> 57:47.050
I never thought I'd see you again, Jake.

57:49.990 --> 57:51.590
You were always my favorite.

57:52.630 --> 57:53.820
Shut up.

57:56.070 --> 57:57.300
Damn it.

57:57.400 --> 58:00.240
Jake? Did you break my tooth?

58:00.340 --> 58:02.640
Would you shut up? I'm thinking.

58:06.240 --> 58:08.410
How many boys we got left?

58:09.750 --> 58:11.180
About the same.

58:12.820 --> 58:14.220
Which is?

58:15.450 --> 58:16.610
Thirty?

58:17.360 --> 58:19.650
That's right. Thirty.

58:20.160 --> 58:21.250
Good.

58:23.360 --> 58:25.060
- That's good.
- Yeah.

58:26.360 --> 58:28.260
You're gonna bring me to the camp.

58:30.700 --> 58:32.690
It's time to set things straight.

58:35.040 --> 58:37.270
We're gonna go to the camp!

58:37.710 --> 58:39.180
How's the haul?

58:39.280 --> 58:42.540
Vulture Mine gold. Looking pretty rich.

58:42.650 --> 58:46.110
- How much dynamite we get?
- We got 50 sticks or so.

58:46.220 --> 58:47.880
Dolan!

58:51.290 --> 58:53.520
About time you got back.

58:53.630 --> 58:55.150
What the hell happened to you?

58:55.790 --> 58:57.090
He did.

59:04.600 --> 59:06.330
Well, shit.

59:10.340 --> 59:12.140
You got some balls

59:12.240 --> 59:15.370
riding back in here
like nothing ever happened.

59:16.450 --> 59:20.510
Boys! Grab your guns. We're riding out.

59:21.050 --> 59:23.020
Boys aren't going anywhere with you,
Jake.

59:24.960 --> 59:27.690
We're fixing to rob us a coach.

59:27.790 --> 59:29.420
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.

59:37.390 --> 59:39.160
Are you her?

59:39.960 --> 59:41.400
Am I who?

59:41.500 --> 59:44.230
The whore that Jake quit this gang for.

59:45.770 --> 59:47.000
You watch your mouth.

59:47.100 --> 59:48.400
Or what?

59:49.400 --> 59:52.130
I run this outfit now.

59:52.240 --> 59:53.670
Put your guns on the whore!

59:53.780 --> 59:57.730
If he so much as twitches,
blow her brains out of her ear.

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:03.120
He said the whore.

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:08.480
You call her a whore again,
it'll be the last word you ever say.

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.890
You ain't in no position
to make threats, boyo.

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:13.790
Hunt, take his gun.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.290
Take his gun!

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.630
Sorry, Jake.

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:41.180
Where's our gold, Jake?

01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:44.150
I don't remember.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.100
Well, I do remember

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:58.500
you telling us you was leaving us
high and dry because of some woman.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:14.790
I guess you just left out the part about
taking all of our gold from that last job?

01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:18.790
So I'm gonna ask you one last time.

01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:21.820
Where is it, Jake?

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:25.460
Demons.

01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:29.660
What's that?

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.210
Demons took your gold.

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:35.380
When you get to hell

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.640
you can ask for it back.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.380
Kill the whore.

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:05.600
I told you not to call her that.

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:07.540
Everybody!

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.940
Drop 'em!

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.480
I said drop 'em!

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.590
Not fun, is it?

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.720
You know, that wasn't very nice.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.120
On your horses!

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:30.860
Go!

01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:35.160
Jake, Jake, Jake. Don't forget your gun.

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:36.530
You'll always be my favorite.

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:48.440
- Mount up!
- Ride!

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.740
- They're here!
- Move out!

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.500
Come on!

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:52.970
Okay. I got you!

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:54.170
I got you!

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.430
Can you swim?

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:17.960
Oh, God.

01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:19.160
Turn your head!

01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:46.050
You all right?

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:52.550
Let's get in.

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.840
We were flying.

01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:16.710
Yeah!

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.950
I don't want to do that again.

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.180
No.

01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:34.020
Hey.

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:36.730
Hey, you stay with me.

01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:39.500
Keep talking.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.230
You remember now, don't you?

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:45.830
What?

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:47.840
The woman.

01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:51.340
Did you love her?

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.780
You can tell me.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.880
I can't remember.

01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:59.020
I must've.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.250
All I know is I owe it to her

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:04.890
to find her.

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.820
Watch out. I'm sorry.

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:11.230
I'm sorry.

01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:14.130
I got you.

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.569
I got you.

01:08:20.939 --> 01:08:22.569
It's not far now.

01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:26.010
You and me,

01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:29.250
we're gonna be just fine.

01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.960
Is that...

01:08:38.529 --> 01:08:39.990
Is that them?

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:41.920
Boss?

01:08:51.810 --> 01:08:55.040
- I got her.
- Give her to me, Nat. Bring her here.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:02.950
- Here. Drink.
- No. Give it to her. Give it to her.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.359
Doc?

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.830
How is she?

01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:32.140
She's gone, pal.

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:36.810
No. No, she's not gone.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.010
She's not. She's not gone!

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.319
Jake.

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:44.290
She's gone.

01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:20.690
- Doc!
- Don't touch him!

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.430
Doc!

01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.590
This is Black Knife.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:02.860
The last of his people.

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:05.910
There's no reasoning with them.
We're all gonna die anyway.

01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:07.810
This is what's left of the Chiricahuas.

01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:09.040
Good riddance to 'em!

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.340
He's saying the white people,

01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:14.280
they brought all this evil to his people.

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:18.010
We brought evil? Evil was here!
You're the evil one!

01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:20.520
He's saying we brought the monsters.

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:23.450
We didn't bring the monsters.
Tell him they took our people, too!

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.990
Tell him they took my wife!

01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:27.530
Shut up!
There's no reasoning with them!

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.690
Tell him what I said, Nat!

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.160
Kill us now!

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:39.630
I'm sorry, but I couldn't tell you.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.260
Are you one of them?

01:12:41.370 --> 01:12:44.860
No. I'm from a different place.

01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:48.030
I took this form
so I could walk among you.

01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:50.900
You should have told me.

01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:53.610
I didn't know if I could heal this body,

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.450
if I would wake up.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.790
He wants to know where you're from.

01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:20.700
What'd she say?

01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:24.140
She says she came from a place
above the stars.

01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:26.910
What does that mean? Another world?
What do you mean?

01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:28.980
What does that mean? What?

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:31.080
He says you shouldn't talk.

01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:32.710
What do you mean I shouldn't talk?
I got questions...

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:35.190
You're a guest of the chief.

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:38.090
Now I'm a guest? I thought
I was a prisoner! What the hell am I?

01:13:38.190 --> 01:13:40.860
Enough! All right. You're both big men!
Great warriors!

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.450
Can we just listen to the woman
tell her story?

01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:45.290
Or whatever she is?
What are they doing here?

01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:47.190
They want gold.

01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:51.100
Well, that's just ridiculous.

01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:53.330
What are they gonna do,
buy something?

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:56.140
It's as rare to them as it is to you.

01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:57.340
What about my grandpa?

01:13:57.450 --> 01:14:01.710
What about my wife? What about
the other people? Are they still alive?

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.810
If they are, they won't be for long.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.220
They're studying your weaknesses.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.290
These are just scouts.

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:15.490
If we let them leave, they'll come back
with more and there will be no survivors.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.720
That's what they did to my people.

01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:20.460
I came here to make sure
it would not happen again,

01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:23.090
but we have to work together.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.470
He says his people will join her.

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:33.150
What do you mean, join her?

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:35.150
What's she going to do?
Where you going to go?

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:37.120
We can find them.
He knows where they are.

01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:42.680
No, I don't.

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.230
I can't remember anything.
I couldn't even remember my own name.

01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:53.760
He says they will take care of that.

01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:20.540
I brought the gold.

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:23.150
Into the house.

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.180
That's why she died.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:30.150
It's not your fault.

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.760
I know where they are.

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:30.270
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:34.270
How did they build something like that?

01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:37.210
They arrived in it. It's their vessel.

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.020
That's only the top.
The rest is underground.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.350
It's how they mine for gold.

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.080
So there is gold here.

01:19:44.230 --> 01:19:45.750
Can they see out of there?

01:19:46.230 --> 01:19:47.890
They don't see well in daylight.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.730
They stay underground in caverns
where it's dark.

01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:22.960
We'll never even get close.

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:25.030
Those flying machines
will just pick us off

01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:26.500
before we get anywhere near it.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.470
There is another way in.

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:30.740
Down there.

01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:32.940
The way I came out.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.610
We got to get those creatures
out of there

01:20:36.710 --> 01:20:40.080
and out in the open,
where we can get at them.

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:43.350
So you can get in with that arm gun,
get our people out.

01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:48.420
We have one advantage,
they underestimate you.

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:50.420
You're like insects to them.

01:20:50.530 --> 01:20:53.320
They're not planning on defending
themselves, so they'll be vulnerable.

01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:58.190
- We haven't got enough men.
- This ain't gonna work.

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:05.710
He says he wants to use your spyglass.

01:21:31.930 --> 01:21:34.830
The Apaches are mountain warriors.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:38.740
He says it's better to fight
from high ground.

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:41.370
Tell him he's a fool.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:44.450
There is no high ground
while they got those flying machines.

01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:46.210
Jake's leaving!

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.360
That's just dandy.

01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:57.620
Son of a bitch.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.500
Quit stalling.
How much gold we had left?

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.160
Barely enough.
But I'm gonna need my share right now

01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:07.670
so I can get as far away from here
as I possibly can.

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.540
- Red?
- I got him, Bull.

01:22:15.710 --> 01:22:17.340
Hey, there.

01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:22.940
I had one hell of a job finding you boys.

01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:26.520
You planning a trip?

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:31.590
We're going as far away as we can go.

01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:33.630
You remember la playa
in Puerto Vallarta?

01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:35.320
They got good fishing.

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:38.620
Good tequila.
You want to come with us?

01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:40.930
Don't make no difference.

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:43.870
It's not far enough.

01:22:45.970 --> 01:22:48.240
What in the hell
were those things, Jake?

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:50.040
It doesn't matter.

01:22:50.150 --> 01:22:54.280
They're gonna find us
and they're gonna wipe us out.

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.180
What in the hell are you saying?

01:22:58.090 --> 01:23:00.680
What I'm saying is you got a choice.

01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:04.320
You can drink your last few hours away
on a beach,

01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:07.590
which by the way, is not a bad idea

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:11.860
or you can follow me one last time.

01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:25.440
We got to make the best use
of our resources.

01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:29.240
We got to have a strict...
Listen to me, damn it!

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:33.080
He doesn't understand tactics.
You got to explain to him.

01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:36.520
Look, we can't just run around hollering

01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:39.920
and throwing spears and
shooting arrows at the damn thing.

01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:44.160
We got to draw them out of there
onto open ground

01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:47.670
where we can surround them,
attack them on all sides.

01:23:47.770 --> 01:23:49.900
Flank them. Explain to him.

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:56.810
He said he's not going to let you
lead his people.

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.650
What's he saying?

01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:12.350
He's saying they need to
open their hearts

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:15.760
and see in you what he has seen.

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.830
That his parents
died in the Mexican War

01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:26.300
and you took him in
when he was only a boy.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.170
That you gave him purpose.

01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:36.540
Taught him how to take care of himself
even though you were not blood.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.860
That you despise battle
but would never run from it.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.690
That you're a fierce warrior
worthy of any fight.

01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:12.290
He says if you're such a great warrior,

01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:15.290
why do you only have a man and a boy
to follow you into battle?

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:53.560
Dog! Dog!

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.690
Boy!

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.100
How are you?

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:12.210
Hot damn.

01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:15.050
Ready to get your son back?

01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:40.130
Give me that. Okay.

01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:49.880
Matches.

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:03.820
I don't have any more matches.
We're gonna have to go down.

01:28:03.930 --> 01:28:05.290
I don't know what we're going to do.

01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:14.990
Go. Go!

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:29.640
Go. Go!

01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:11.420
I think we destroyed it.

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.670
Demons are coming out.

01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:31.710
Take this. Go up where I showed you.

01:29:31.810 --> 01:29:33.540
- You see our people, wave your arms.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:33.650 --> 01:29:35.550
Move out!

01:29:48.930 --> 01:29:50.330
Good job.

01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:53.760
If our people are in there,
I'll get them out.

01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:55.100
Godspeed.

01:29:56.570 --> 01:29:57.870
Let's get them!

01:31:11.050 --> 01:31:13.640
This is how they get the gold out.

01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:39.410
They're not going down!

01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:42.940
They will!
Keep at it till we get our people out!

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:46.070
Doc!

01:32:46.810 --> 01:32:48.440
Doc, get down here!

01:32:51.610 --> 01:32:52.740
Jesus.

01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:56.740
Doc!

01:32:58.050 --> 01:32:59.580
Did we get one?

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.020
Yeah, we got one.

01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:09.590
I always dreamed of riding into battle
with you.

01:33:12.630 --> 01:33:15.660
I always dreamed
of having a son like you.

01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:20.330
Go.

01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:22.410
Get Percy.

01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:24.780
Get your son.

01:34:53.630 --> 01:34:55.190
Don't look into the light.

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.670
- I told you not to look into the light.
- Yeah, right.

01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:55.190
How long are they gonna be like this?

01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:57.090
Each one's different.

01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.090
Hold them off.

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.100
You'd better hurry.

01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:48.210
There's more of them coming!

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.310
Go!

01:37:48.810 --> 01:37:50.330
Everybody's out.

01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:52.310
Right.

01:37:53.710 --> 01:37:56.180
Hey! Where are you going?

01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:59.350
It's this way!

01:38:48.570 --> 01:38:49.660
Go. Go!

01:40:25.570 --> 01:40:27.690
What the hell are you doing?
We have to get out of here!

01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:29.000
No!

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.630
I came here to destroy that thing.

01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:32.730
How?

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:34.930
With the bracelet. Take it off.

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:37.010
Wait, I can't take it off.

01:40:37.110 --> 01:40:38.740
Yes, you can. You can control it.

01:40:38.850 --> 01:40:41.440
- How?
- Same way you shoot it. With your mind.

01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:45.140
You have to stop thinking.

01:40:56.230 --> 01:40:57.530
This isn't working.

01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:14.780
It fell off.

01:41:24.330 --> 01:41:27.450
If I can get it to its core, I can stop them.

01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:32.090
Let's go.

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:44.470
Take this.

01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:11.860
Throw it!

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.070
- Good-bye, Jake.
- What?

01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:22.710
Wait! Ella!

01:42:24.490 --> 01:42:25.710
No!

01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:27.900
I see them! I see them!

01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:29.950
They got out.
They're coming out the other side!

01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:31.210
You see Percy?

01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:36.380
Yeah, I see him!

01:43:36.490 --> 01:43:37.980
What about Jake and Ella?

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:40.690
No. They're not there.

01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:41.470
You all right, old man?

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.020
- Where's the girl?
- She's still inside.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:01.290
Go!

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.500
Grandpa!

01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:28.840
It's me.

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:31.970
Emmett.

01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:33.380
Emmett.

01:49:39.450 --> 01:49:41.250
You're all grown up.

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:50.490
Percy.

01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:57.500
Don't you remember me, boy?

01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:02.640
I'm sorry. I don't remember much.

01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:05.100
I'm your father.

01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:08.070
Pa.

01:50:18.430 --> 01:50:20.790
Do you remember me?

01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:37.740
I thought you were dead.
I thought you were dead.

01:52:20.010 --> 01:52:23.040
All this gold's
gonna make things different.

01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:27.210
We're gonna have
a railroad in here soon.

01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:29.910
That'll change the cattle business.

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:35.360
Run these ledgers
back to the bank for me, will you?

01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:37.860
Tell them I need some new checks.

01:52:38.770 --> 01:52:39.860
Okay.

01:52:41.870 --> 01:52:45.960
I want the new ones to read
"Dolarhyde and Son."

01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:53.110
- That sound good to you?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:07.860
- John.
- Woodrow.

01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:12.860
It appears our town
is about to get a whole lot bigger.

01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:20.630
You weren't gonna leave
without saying good-bye, were you?

01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:26.210
I'm a wanted man.

01:53:27.150 --> 01:53:30.740
I could have sworn I saw
Jake Lonergan die in those caves,

01:53:30.850 --> 01:53:32.280
didn't you, Sheriff?

01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:34.010
Damn shame.

01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:36.350
I was looking forward
to hanging him myself.

01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:40.050
I could use a good man around here.

01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:41.960
Yes, you could.

01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:48.630
Jake.

01:53:50.970 --> 01:53:53.000
She's in a better place.

01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:58.330
I'll see you around, Colonel.
