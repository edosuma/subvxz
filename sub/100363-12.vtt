WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.657
Previously on "The Magicians"...

00:07.658 --> 00:09.829
- What are we going to do?
- We gotta kill the Dark King.

00:09.830 --> 00:14.348
Fillory can never be free so
long as the Dark King reigns.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.391
Surprised?

00:16.392 --> 00:18.733
You must stop this, whatever the cost.

00:18.734 --> 00:21.646
Well, the cost is blowing
up the entire planet,

00:21.647 --> 00:22.814
- which is...
- A decent option?

00:22.815 --> 00:26.067
So you're saying we can use
the Ark, rescue the people,

00:26.068 --> 00:28.528
blow up Fillory, and stop the Dark King?

00:28.529 --> 00:32.381
Do these fiends, do they succeed
in stealing the people

00:32.383 --> 00:33.701
and building a new world for them?

00:33.702 --> 00:35.411
I made no mention of a new world.

00:36.550 --> 00:38.059
It is you.

00:38.060 --> 00:40.748
You and your friends
are the invading force.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.334
What about the World Seed from Q's page?

00:43.335 --> 00:45.920
If we could find it, we could
use it to build a new world,

00:45.921 --> 00:47.039
a new Fillory.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.881
We're looking for The Couple.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.592
If it was anything else...

00:50.593 --> 00:52.052
They have something we need.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.511
The World Seed,

00:53.512 --> 00:55.972
the most valuable object
in the multiverse,

00:55.973 --> 00:58.141
which is why I wanted to steal it.

00:58.142 --> 01:00.059
We spent months constructing a map.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.539
We called it our heist book.

01:01.540 --> 01:02.889
Here.

01:02.890 --> 01:04.394
Is that Gavin from the Library?

01:04.394 --> 01:07.650
- What happened to you?
- Marina hired me to rob The Couple.

01:07.651 --> 01:10.029
She didn't tell us that
the plan was suicidal

01:10.030 --> 01:11.750
without the Harmonic Convergence.

01:11.754 --> 01:13.769
You twats stopped the convergence,

01:13.770 --> 01:15.309
there wasn't enough magic,

01:15.310 --> 01:16.868
Marina sent us in anyway.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.199
Give me the page.

01:21.990 --> 01:23.458
Okay, you win.

01:23.459 --> 01:25.672
Oh, it's yours. It's yours.

01:25.673 --> 01:28.203
Bottling our emotions.

01:28.204 --> 01:29.589
Literally.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.779
This must be what undergoing

01:32.780 --> 01:34.677
the Vulcan Ritual of Kolinahr is like.

01:34.678 --> 01:35.887
I like your sweater.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.848
- Are you saying that to be cruel?
- No.

01:37.849 --> 01:39.933
I saw no reason not to share.

01:44.770 --> 01:47.769
I based my whole outfit
around that bottle!

01:47.770 --> 01:49.392
Ow.

01:49.393 --> 01:51.944
God, shut up.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.447
What's happening to you

01:54.448 --> 01:57.533
looks just like what happened to my mom.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.869
And the episodes didn't
stop when I was born.

01:59.870 --> 02:00.953
They got worse.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.609
The Circumstances Control Panel?

02:02.610 --> 02:05.469
I figured if The Couple is
going to use the World Seed,

02:05.470 --> 02:09.419
they need clean magic, so
without this, they are stuck.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.963
The Couple just got the
last thing they need.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.579
They have the seed,
the page, and the panel.

02:13.580 --> 02:14.599
We got to tell the others.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.720
They need to steal that seed now.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.056
Okay, guys, this is a horrible story.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.850
I really hate telling it, and
I'm only gonna say it once.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.849
The Nave Hotel.

02:29.803 --> 02:32.872
Current home of The
Couple for two reasons.

02:32.873 --> 02:35.072
One, the house rules.

02:35.073 --> 02:38.442
Per a jamming spell,
you can't do any battle magic,

02:38.443 --> 02:41.139
wards prevent traveling in and
out, cell phones don't work,

02:41.140 --> 02:42.813
and if you're caught
with any kind of weapon

02:42.814 --> 02:45.539
or engage in any sort of physical beef

02:45.540 --> 02:48.399
or try to scam the hotel
or any of its guests...

02:48.400 --> 02:50.339
Bye-bye.

02:50.340 --> 02:51.499
Idea being the Nave

02:51.500 --> 02:54.579
is the magical world's
number one safe space,

02:54.580 --> 02:57.629
which is strictly
enforced by the bellhops.

02:57.630 --> 02:58.846
Arguing is allowed.

02:58.850 --> 03:01.293
Physical altercation is not.

03:01.294 --> 03:03.002
The creepy dicks are golems

03:03.003 --> 03:05.672
who've been enchanted to be empaths.

03:05.673 --> 03:07.271
Good-bye, ladies.

03:08.647 --> 03:09.949
They have to see you.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.279
But if they can

03:11.280 --> 03:14.560
and you radiate the kind of
micro-aggressions they sense,

03:14.570 --> 03:16.479
you get the boot.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.913
Or worse.

03:17.914 --> 03:21.319
We were up to some major
no good, so we steered clear.

03:21.320 --> 03:25.310
In the basement, reason two
The Couple settled at the Nave:

03:25.320 --> 03:27.323
the vault.

03:27.324 --> 03:29.499
Famously impenetrable.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.159
Except, I thought, vulnerable

03:32.160 --> 03:33.919
during the Harmonic Convergence

03:33.920 --> 03:36.300
which you fucked into a cocked hat.

03:38.170 --> 03:41.820
Hence the safe crack was slow going.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.670
But punching a hole in
the anti-traveler wards

03:46.674 --> 03:48.643
was right on sched.

03:48.644 --> 03:51.774
Meanwhile, I was running it
all from a safe distance.

03:59.060 --> 04:01.366
Or trying to.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.912
That place has some killer protections

04:05.913 --> 04:07.340
against magical spyware.

04:09.870 --> 04:13.837
Marina, Marina. Looks like I'm in.

04:18.180 --> 04:23.060
Whew, crikey, it is
dick-shrivel cold in here.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.589
Long story. Unbearable.

04:32.590 --> 04:35.340
There was no World Seed in the vault.

04:37.390 --> 04:38.739
And then, because the vault

04:38.740 --> 04:42.020
took so long to crack without
the Harmonic Convergence...

04:44.010 --> 04:46.620
It all went horribly pear-shaped.

04:48.860 --> 04:51.679
And we know what that
meant for poor Gavin.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.919
So boosting anything

05:01.920 --> 05:04.599
from that hotel without
the Harmonic Convergence

05:04.600 --> 05:05.879
is a shit show.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.054
What makes you ducklings
think you can do any better?

05:08.055 --> 05:11.061
Well, for one thing,
you had bad information.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.144
Remind me who in the Disney
Princess fuck you are?

05:15.145 --> 05:16.483
She's someone who can read this.

05:18.710 --> 05:20.733
It turns out it's a form of Fillorian

05:20.734 --> 05:22.242
used in ember worship.

05:22.243 --> 05:23.904
I really should have recognized it.

05:23.905 --> 05:27.279
So according to the page,
the World Seed can only live

05:27.280 --> 05:30.285
when the temperature is 99
degrees with 99% humidity.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.379
And the vault was freezing.

05:31.380 --> 05:33.139
There's no way The Couple
would keep it there.

05:33.140 --> 05:36.019
- It would die.
- This is so you guys.

05:36.020 --> 05:37.899
Top info.

05:37.900 --> 05:38.963
Too late.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.699
Wrong, 'cause now we know
where the seed isn't.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.870
- So us guys are doing this.
- Yep.

05:51.230 --> 05:56.130
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

05:56.220 --> 05:57.220
No.

05:57.221 --> 05:58.859
Look, I get this is
hard, okay, but we...

05:58.860 --> 06:01.059
- Julia, no.
- ... have to do everything we can

06:01.060 --> 06:02.899
in our power to make sure that

06:02.900 --> 06:04.572
our child has a better
mother than you did.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.074
- He already does.
- She might.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.329
If we can find out what
happens to traveler moms.

06:09.330 --> 06:11.027
And the only one that
we can talk to is yours.

06:11.028 --> 06:12.371
I don't even know where she is.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.497
I do. Connecticut,

06:13.498 --> 06:15.859
according to the locator spell.

06:15.860 --> 06:17.719
Okay, you realize that you
are getting more intense

06:17.720 --> 06:19.197
every day and impossible to argue with

06:19.198 --> 06:20.630
and it is kind of scary.

06:20.631 --> 06:23.383
Hormones, dude. Enjoy the ride.

06:24.670 --> 06:26.739
_

06:41.560 --> 06:43.649
So I lensed the outside of the hotel,

06:43.650 --> 06:47.322
and this room is 30 degrees
hotter than all the others.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.202
It's got to be where The Couple
has the World Seed stashed.

06:50.203 --> 06:54.293
Also there's someone in there,

06:54.294 --> 06:55.831
probably a guard.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.219
Brava, but stealing the seed

06:58.220 --> 07:00.130
means taking it out of that hot house.

07:00.134 --> 07:01.969
How do you transport
it without killing it?

07:01.970 --> 07:05.299
- Well, you tell me.
- Well, I don't know.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.899
But The Couple did.

07:07.900 --> 07:11.743
- Magnus Dellacorte.
- Top hedge, west coast.

07:11.744 --> 07:15.601
Best friends George and Paloma Ball.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.728
The Balls.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.065
Explains why they go by The Couple.

07:20.066 --> 07:21.659
Magnus lost two things

07:21.660 --> 07:23.262
the night of his 53rd birthday party.

07:23.263 --> 07:26.821
His life, to a coronary;
and the World Seed,

07:26.822 --> 07:28.489
both courtesy of The Couple

07:28.490 --> 07:31.993
who aren't such good friends,
but badass bandits.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.620
But how did they get the seed out?

07:34.621 --> 07:36.956
Five minutes in the
open air and it's dead.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.625
Paloma's wearing couture.

07:38.626 --> 07:42.249
Maybe they kept it warm
with their white-hot taste.

07:42.250 --> 07:44.588
Except that bag.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.465
It's a Birkin knockoff.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.209
And a shit one.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.459
Really? It looks kind of fancy.

07:50.460 --> 07:53.139
To you, which is why you're so adorable.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.199
Maybe the bag is homemade.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.289
- Some kind of...
- Incubator they cooked up.

07:58.290 --> 07:59.639
To keep the seed toasty.

07:59.640 --> 08:00.959
Yeah.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.479
Good job, class.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.963
- Mm-hmm.
- Couple's suite.

08:04.964 --> 08:06.819
We make sure they aren't
there, we break in,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.579
find the incubator bag,

08:08.580 --> 08:10.560
which'll definitely be on-site,

08:10.570 --> 08:12.399
because Paloma would never wear it

08:12.400 --> 08:14.115
unless it was to steal the seed.

08:14.116 --> 08:17.599
Might be criminal Tiffany's,
but it's fashion Walmart.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.622
We go to temperature control.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.779
We crank the seed room down to freezing.

08:20.780 --> 08:21.809
The guard freaks out.

08:21.810 --> 08:23.168
Cell phones don't work in the Nave,

08:23.170 --> 08:25.713
so he has to call The Couple on
the landline, which is dead...

08:25.714 --> 08:27.153
Because I cut it.

08:27.154 --> 08:29.383
He goes full pant-shit,
has to find The Couple.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.383
- Opens the seed room door...
- Runs out.

08:31.384 --> 08:33.578
We're right there with
the homemade hot pocket,

08:33.580 --> 08:35.429
we drop the seed in and jet.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.017
- Then the guard will see you.
- Three against one.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.269
- Bellhops?
- We pull the fire alarm,

08:40.270 --> 08:42.719
blend into the emotional
pandemonium, exit.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.939
With a nod to "Fantastic Beasts."

08:44.940 --> 08:46.943
One problem. What's
happening in the basement

08:46.944 --> 08:48.402
needs to be timed

08:48.403 --> 08:50.643
to the second with what's
happening in the seed room.

08:50.644 --> 08:52.531
Take too long and the seed
will freeze to death.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.075
And with all communications jammed,

08:54.076 --> 08:56.744
how's each team supposed to
know what to do and when?

08:56.745 --> 08:58.412
Well, there's the conductor spell.

08:58.413 --> 09:01.239
Created by a conductor
who was going blind.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.660
So he and his orchestra
could still communicate.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.545
Wouldn't all those voices
be kind of confusing?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.863
Each musician only hears the conductor,

09:08.864 --> 09:10.163
but never one another.

09:10.164 --> 09:11.719
I'm totally sure I don't understand

09:11.720 --> 09:13.469
and totally sure it's going to work.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.721
Why wouldn't it set off
the hotel protections?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.599
The spell was designed to help artists,

09:17.600 --> 09:19.469
so by nature, it's innocuous.

09:19.470 --> 09:20.727
You'll be the conductor then?

09:20.728 --> 09:24.700
I would, but I don't know
the hotel, not like...

09:26.490 --> 09:29.459
So wait, not only are we breaking
into a hotel of horrors,

09:29.460 --> 09:31.238
but our conductor has
to be a psychopath?

09:31.239 --> 09:34.399
Sociopath, technically.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.784
And you wrote my word as bond yourself.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.062
What happened to that
arrogant self-confidence

09:39.063 --> 09:40.455
you're so famous for?

09:42.791 --> 09:44.793
Oops. Right.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.838
Look, if you're too scared
to pull your weight...

09:48.839 --> 09:50.242
I'm fine.

09:50.243 --> 09:53.092
As long as Zelda's there
to keep an eye on you.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.386
Mm-kay.

09:58.510 --> 10:00.259
That should adjust for circumstances.

10:00.260 --> 10:03.084
Remember, you have to
keep hold of the baton.

10:03.085 --> 10:05.859
If you let go, it breaks the spell.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.100
Shall we test it?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.559
Okay, kids.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.820
Get ready to be my sock puppets.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.864
What is this sorcery?

10:14.865 --> 10:17.240
Woman in my head, reveal yourself!

10:24.050 --> 10:26.208
He must have been in range of the spell.

10:26.209 --> 10:29.086
So I have to run a heist
with a pig in my head?

10:29.087 --> 10:30.379
What the shit with the gun?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.673
It is to put in the hands of a hero

10:32.674 --> 10:35.759
who will do what is just and necessary.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.122
Which is?

10:37.123 --> 10:40.097
Assassinate she who
plots to destroy Fillory.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.429
Julia Wicker.

10:41.430 --> 10:42.851
What the hell is wrong with you?

10:42.852 --> 10:45.089
- Wait, is that thing loaded?
- Of course it is!

10:46.970 --> 10:51.059
No, no! Please! People,
the fate of my world is at stake.

10:51.060 --> 10:53.402
Oh, gentlemen, please
control your spinsters.

11:04.583 --> 11:06.415

12:52.070 --> 12:53.731
This is why I don't hang
out with you people.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.817
But on the bright side,
we were pitch perfect.

13:01.090 --> 13:02.799
I will kill Julia.

13:02.800 --> 13:06.159
You have my solemn word
as a devout Catholic.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.749
A hero has risen.

13:08.750 --> 13:11.622
With a most excellent singing voice.

13:11.623 --> 13:13.449
Well, we'll karaoke in Fillory

13:13.450 --> 13:15.732
because it's definitely
not getting destroyed.

13:15.733 --> 13:17.339
- Vaya con Dios.
- Yeah.

13:21.210 --> 13:22.579
I think I speak for the group

13:22.580 --> 13:25.130
in wondering why the fuck
did we all just chorus line?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.931
Yeah, and I heard all of you
in my head, not just Marina.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.099
Yeah, what the hell?

13:29.100 --> 13:31.143
Our circumstances are unstable.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.059
Our collective surge of
emotion must have broken down

13:34.060 --> 13:35.889
some of the spell's barriers.

13:35.890 --> 13:38.879
And as for the singing, well,
it was designed by a conductor

13:38.880 --> 13:41.779
and music is the purest
manifestation of feeling...

13:41.780 --> 13:43.923
So let me get this straight.

13:43.924 --> 13:47.117
Every time we have a feeling,
we're gonna go full-on "Glee"?

13:47.118 --> 13:50.489
That doesn't seem ideal
for, you know, a heist.

13:50.490 --> 13:51.599
Wait, do you guys remember

13:51.600 --> 13:53.245
when we were learning battle magic?

13:53.246 --> 13:55.959
If the spell's gonna make
us break out into song

13:55.960 --> 13:57.129
every time we get worked up,

13:57.130 --> 13:59.213
why don't we emotion bottle ourselves?

13:59.214 --> 14:00.922
'Cause that went so well the last time.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.008
No, no. That's good.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.943
It might help also avoid
bellhop detection,

14:04.944 --> 14:06.513
no emotions for them to sense.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.652
So repress the overwhelming urge

14:09.653 --> 14:12.083
to sing while stealing shit.

14:12.084 --> 14:14.160
It's eighth grade all over again.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.660
_

14:18.800 --> 14:21.568
Hi. I'm looking for a patient.

14:21.569 --> 14:24.114
- Name?
- Neela Adiyodi.

14:25.820 --> 14:28.910
There must be some mistake.
I'm Neela Adiyodi.

14:30.330 --> 14:31.672
I've spent my whole life

14:31.673 --> 14:34.142
thinking my mom was a basket case.

14:34.143 --> 14:36.899
You're telling me she's fine?

14:36.900 --> 14:38.179
She was fine with me.

14:38.180 --> 14:40.672
We need to see how she is with you.

14:47.290 --> 14:49.823
Look, I won't pretend

14:49.824 --> 14:52.267
that I can even imagine
what this is like for you.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.670
But you won't be alone.

16:12.250 --> 16:15.179
We're in. Marina, you copy?

16:15.180 --> 16:18.469
Loud and clear. How
are you guys feeling?

16:18.470 --> 16:21.139
We're not.

16:21.140 --> 16:23.059
Pete.

16:23.060 --> 16:24.149
You're up.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.580
- Oh.
- Yeah.

16:29.470 --> 16:30.531
Look.

16:30.532 --> 16:33.326
Everyone in the know
knows about you guys.

16:33.327 --> 16:36.529
And what exactly do they know?

16:36.530 --> 16:39.289
The best is barely good enough.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.449
That's what I deal in.

16:41.450 --> 16:44.462
Art, spells, totems, best of the best.

16:45.300 --> 16:48.759
- You've got six minutes.
- That's too bad.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.442
I just ordered a bottle
of 2005 Haut-Brion

16:51.443 --> 16:54.140
that will take at least
half an hour to decant.

16:56.060 --> 16:58.141
36 minutes, then.

17:02.660 --> 17:05.689
_

17:29.760 --> 17:30.840
Is this the one?

17:40.250 --> 17:41.440
That's...

17:43.100 --> 17:44.188
very moist.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.980
Guys.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.719
The Couple's been translating
the World Seed page.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.559
But wrong.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.350
Grab it.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.539
And we're Fogged.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.585
Guys, what is going on?

18:21.240 --> 18:23.102
Should I wait here for you guys, or?

18:25.360 --> 18:26.731
Sir, there's a problem.

18:27.834 --> 18:29.099
Is that my suitcase?

18:29.100 --> 18:30.159
You told The Couple that

18:30.160 --> 18:32.440
this is a bottle of 2005 Haut-Brion,

18:32.445 --> 18:34.321
when, in fact, it's Two-Buck Chuck.

18:34.322 --> 18:38.200
That constitutes deceit,
a violation of hotel protocol.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.869
You'll be checking out immediately.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.668
Abort.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.836
Fogg 17 showed up.
He's got Team Incubator.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.964
That's catastrophic.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.020
- We rescue them.
- Yup.

19:10.700 --> 19:11.940
All right.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.103
Hello.

19:21.104 --> 19:22.473
Management has been alerted

19:22.474 --> 19:24.121
to the presence of unauthorized guests.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.499
- Oh.
- Please present your key cards.

19:28.820 --> 19:31.649
We are late. Sorry.

19:39.900 --> 19:40.969
Hello?

19:40.970 --> 19:43.499
Jesus, Alice, what's going on?

19:43.500 --> 19:45.392
Answer me.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.893
Eliot? Kady?

19:46.894 --> 19:49.271

20:41.157 --> 20:43.784
Okay.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.692
Guess Alice had a little moment.

20:45.693 --> 20:48.121
Get your shit together people.

20:49.363 --> 20:52.200
Huh, what do we have here?

20:54.210 --> 20:55.249
Oh, Christ.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.659
You brought the gun. Strong choice.

20:57.660 --> 20:58.883
Thanks.

21:06.680 --> 21:07.929
Thank you, Henry.

21:07.930 --> 21:09.893
George, my pleasure.

21:09.894 --> 21:12.437
On our new world, you can
have your own island.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.816
No. I want my own goddamn country.

21:15.817 --> 21:17.479
Fine.

21:17.480 --> 21:18.819
There won't be a new world.

21:18.820 --> 21:19.979
Really?

21:19.980 --> 21:22.399
Your translation of the page is wrong.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.389
You're going to end up killing the seed.

21:24.390 --> 21:25.659
How would you know?

21:25.660 --> 21:26.785
Smart girl.

21:26.786 --> 21:27.953
Keep going.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.772
I'm Fillorian.

21:29.773 --> 21:31.206
I can translate the page correctly.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.375
I'll even help you grow the seed.

21:33.376 --> 21:36.369
If you spare my friends.

21:36.370 --> 21:38.819
I'm so sorry. I can't control it.

21:38.820 --> 21:40.082
I'm sorry.

21:40.083 --> 21:42.099
Your weaponized emotional baggage

21:42.100 --> 21:44.180
turned out to be a weirdly good thing.

21:44.184 --> 21:45.887
So Fen pulled a stall.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.953
She's headed to the seed
room with The Couple.

21:47.954 --> 21:50.392
Josh and Margo are still
in their suite with Fogg.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.153
Can you get them free?

21:52.154 --> 21:54.019
Kady, if you can take out Fogg alone,

21:54.020 --> 21:55.480
I think I can help Alice.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.080
Good luck.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.700
Alice? Do you trust me?

22:10.450 --> 22:13.039
- What are you doing?
- Just a little sip.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.660
To the confusion of our enemies.

22:28.750 --> 22:30.679
Alice, whatever it is,
whatever you're feeling,

22:30.680 --> 22:33.143
you can just tell me.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.109
I just can't stop thinking
about what he did to me.

22:42.680 --> 22:46.719

26:19.740 --> 26:21.663
It's okay.

26:23.870 --> 26:25.460
First thing you have to do

26:25.470 --> 26:28.232
is explain why you want
to build a new world.

26:28.233 --> 26:29.899
- To you?
- To the seed.

26:29.900 --> 26:31.719
It's alive, and in order to grow,

26:31.720 --> 26:34.300
it needs to know exactly
what you want and why.

26:36.630 --> 26:40.440
The seed will know if you lie
and will refuse to grow.

26:44.860 --> 26:48.480
We've made powerful
enemies here on Earth.

26:49.940 --> 26:53.650
And one cursed us, making us...

26:53.654 --> 26:55.281
Unable to have children.

26:56.620 --> 26:59.430
But on a new world,

26:59.433 --> 27:02.533
beyond the reach of our enemies,

27:02.534 --> 27:04.289
we hope to have a family.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.899
Okay.

27:05.900 --> 27:08.779
I have to admit, that's not a
motive I could have guessed,

27:08.780 --> 27:12.256
but do you really think you'd
make the best parents?

27:24.200 --> 27:25.811
Hi, Mom.

27:30.900 --> 27:31.942
William?

27:34.640 --> 27:36.987
You're going to be a father.

27:36.988 --> 27:39.304
That's...

27:39.305 --> 27:41.242
that's wonderful.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.300
It's why I'm here.

27:44.960 --> 27:48.751
I need to know everything
you went through.

27:52.070 --> 27:54.000
When did you start hearing voices?

28:00.760 --> 28:04.429
About three months into the pregnancy.

28:04.430 --> 28:09.299
At first, they thought it
was a chemical imbalance.

28:09.300 --> 28:12.566
But after you were born,
I started to get worse.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.679
They said the stress of
parenting brought on

28:16.680 --> 28:19.360
a latent psychological disorder,

28:19.365 --> 28:21.408
probably one I'd inherited.

28:25.550 --> 28:28.820
The first time I had to send you away...

28:32.540 --> 28:34.492
I hear myself say that,

28:34.493 --> 28:36.423
and I still can't believe I did it.

28:36.424 --> 28:40.500
- I'm so sorry...
- Mom, I'm okay.

28:42.970 --> 28:45.099
I need you to tell me
everything you can.

28:46.540 --> 28:48.439
The voices went away when you did,

28:48.440 --> 28:50.840
and when you came back, so did they.

28:52.210 --> 28:53.619
Every time you came back,

28:53.620 --> 28:55.525
there was less and less
of the little boy...

28:55.526 --> 28:57.026
Mom, this isn't about me.

28:57.027 --> 28:59.904
I wanted so much to raise you,

28:59.905 --> 29:02.060
love you, protect you.

29:03.640 --> 29:06.790
But what you needed
protection from was me.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.501
What?

29:13.760 --> 29:15.249
Mom?

29:15.250 --> 29:17.819
I'm sorry. Someone's calling me.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.550
What is it? What do you need?

29:20.640 --> 29:23.090
Mom, there's no one calling you.

29:24.150 --> 29:26.265
Of course there is. It must
be one of my patients.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.800
There's more of them.

29:33.050 --> 29:34.840
You don't hear them? They're screaming.

29:36.010 --> 29:37.759
I don't.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.653
Oh, no. No.

29:40.654 --> 29:44.359
No, no, not again. Please stop.

29:44.360 --> 29:46.399
You need to hurry it up, Kady.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.830
Just be careful.

29:48.860 --> 29:52.359
Guys, it's Kady.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.899
We have a problem.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.718
Let me guess, camouflage potion?

30:03.719 --> 30:05.386
Liquid explosive?

30:05.387 --> 30:08.960
Ah, good old chloroform. Hmm.

30:11.290 --> 30:14.312
Huh. Goddamn scotch.

30:14.313 --> 30:17.148
But not just any scotch.

30:17.149 --> 30:20.799
Isabella Islay's Single Malt.

30:20.800 --> 30:23.370
God damn it, who knew you had taste?

30:24.570 --> 30:27.059
- Wait, no. I need that.
- Are you a drunk now?

30:27.060 --> 30:28.619
Well, congratulations.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.490
Let me help you get back on the wagon.

30:34.540 --> 30:38.719
Now why don't you save
us all some trouble

30:38.720 --> 30:41.339
and tell me where the rest
of your colleagues are.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.519
I...

30:43.520 --> 30:46.629
God damn it.

30:46.630 --> 30:48.079
What did you put in this?

30:48.080 --> 30:52.089
A pharmaceutical I bought off
a very helpful bartender.

30:53.580 --> 30:55.889
Street name, Archie.

30:55.890 --> 30:57.480
But...

30:58.857 --> 31:00.900
What just happened?

31:00.901 --> 31:04.139
I just sent him on a trip
to the Etheric Realm

31:04.140 --> 31:07.439
where rules prevent Henry
Fogg from leaving.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.119
Here's hoping they're too high
to notice there's a new one.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.411
Nice work.

31:11.412 --> 31:12.954
Okay. Alice and Eliot?

31:12.955 --> 31:15.707
If you're done with the singing?

31:17.040 --> 31:18.209
You sure you're okay?

31:18.210 --> 31:21.170
No. But I can do this.

31:21.171 --> 31:25.007
Great, now everything's fine, but...

31:25.008 --> 31:27.193
medium-sized bump in the road.

31:27.194 --> 31:31.479
Pete just called from a cell
phone outside the hotel.

31:31.480 --> 31:35.430
He got caught doing a very Pete scam

31:35.436 --> 31:36.561
and they booted him.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.522
- The suitcase?
- Went with him.

31:39.340 --> 31:42.109
There goes our escape route.

31:42.110 --> 31:44.790
I'm almost annoyed.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.325
I might have an idea.

31:58.167 --> 31:59.830
Open the window.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.740
Let's hope that works.

32:26.862 --> 32:27.869
Well, that was a disaster.

32:27.870 --> 32:29.697
Let's go before I check myself in here.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.407
Hang on. Look.

32:31.408 --> 32:34.949
When she's alone,
everything's normal, but,

32:34.950 --> 32:37.331
but when you show up...

32:40.020 --> 32:43.959
My traveler shit doesn't work
and I still mess her up.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.419
Functional or not, you're still you.

32:46.420 --> 32:48.499
So it's...

32:48.500 --> 32:50.385
it's gonna be the same
for you and the baby?

32:51.700 --> 32:55.010
Unless we figure out what it is

32:55.014 --> 32:57.309
and find a way to cut it.

33:02.314 --> 33:06.273
Okay, Alice and Eliot are
en route to the basement.

33:06.274 --> 33:09.111
Kady, Josh, Margo, get ready to move.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.281
Standing by, Marina.

33:12.020 --> 33:13.074
Oh.

33:15.123 --> 33:17.160
If it's the pig again,
we're having pork chops.

33:22.830 --> 33:25.332
- You've gotta be shitting me.
- I beg your pardon?

33:25.333 --> 33:27.256
Oh, hey, babe. What are you doing here?

33:28.715 --> 33:32.093
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

33:32.094 --> 33:34.136
I put a locator spell on the heist book.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.472
And since you've been MIA for two days,

33:36.473 --> 33:37.848
I figured I'd find you with it

33:37.849 --> 33:41.519
doing exactly what you promised
you'd never do again.

33:41.520 --> 33:45.052
Look, babe, it's not what it looks like.

33:45.053 --> 33:48.322
- But I mean, I mean it is, but...
- God, I'm an idiot.

33:48.323 --> 33:50.484
Listen, babe, people's
lives are on the line.

33:50.485 --> 33:51.619
You're doing that thing

33:51.620 --> 33:53.419
where you call me babe a bunch of times,

33:53.420 --> 33:56.242
which is exactly how I
know that you're lying.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.328
Okay, this is not the time.
And it's also not about you.

33:58.329 --> 34:00.289
So...

34:02.916 --> 34:06.168
What the fuck did you just do?

34:06.169 --> 34:09.005
Marina, do you copy?

34:09.005 --> 34:11.049
Are we good to go?

34:12.350 --> 34:13.802
She's offline.

34:15.050 --> 34:17.639
Fair to say, "act out"?

34:18.170 --> 34:19.460
I know you mean well, Julia,

34:19.469 --> 34:21.007
but I really can't talk right now.

34:21.009 --> 34:24.896
Okay, look, can I just
show you something?

34:29.109 --> 34:30.319
Where'd you get this?

34:32.670 --> 34:35.239
You see that cord thing between you?

34:35.239 --> 34:36.742
What's going on?

34:43.623 --> 34:45.751
You're not crazy, Neela.

34:47.590 --> 34:49.545
Look, magic is real.

34:50.672 --> 34:53.716
I'm a magician. And so is your son.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.760
But he's a rare breed

34:55.761 --> 34:59.597
with this link that they
have to their mothers.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.515
Every time they're close by...

35:01.516 --> 35:02.726
- Stop!
- ... their abilities start to bleed over...

35:02.727 --> 35:04.186
Stop. Stop!

35:05.520 --> 35:07.188
Just stop.

35:07.189 --> 35:11.052
My baby has the same abilities as Penny,

35:11.053 --> 35:13.069
which means it causes the same problems.

35:13.070 --> 35:15.072
Oh, this isn't happening.

35:16.650 --> 35:18.299
This is happening.

35:18.300 --> 35:20.079
Look, I swear, I know I'm asking a lot,

35:20.080 --> 35:22.189
but if you could just take a
chance and let me help you,

35:22.190 --> 35:23.699
you could have your son back.

35:23.700 --> 35:26.700
You could get to know your grandchild.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.462
Wouldn't that be worth it?

35:34.880 --> 35:36.301
I can't.

35:40.090 --> 35:41.519
I can't go through this again.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.100
It'll kill me.

35:44.380 --> 35:46.740
Tell William I'm sorry.

35:54.860 --> 35:56.099
How many times do I have to tell you

35:56.100 --> 35:58.489
the heist is not for me?

35:58.490 --> 36:01.699
Right, and you're not
fucking the sexy librarian.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.490
Her? Don't be ridiculous.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.903
Oh, my, no. But thank you.

36:05.904 --> 36:08.499
How can I believe anything that you say?

36:08.500 --> 36:10.179
It took a fucking spell

36:10.180 --> 36:12.099
for you to care about anyone
other than yourself...

36:12.100 --> 36:13.599
I do care.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.219
But I'm also pretty done bending
over backwards for you.

36:16.220 --> 36:18.399
So you either get on board
with the me who's me,

36:18.400 --> 36:20.080
or you can fuck off.

36:21.010 --> 36:23.773
Oh, good.

36:23.774 --> 36:24.849
Thanks.

36:24.850 --> 36:28.420
I finally know where we stand.

36:37.280 --> 36:41.199
- Are, are you all right?
- Fix the goddamn baton.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.899
Look, I know this was maybe
worse than you thought,

36:46.900 --> 36:50.560
but now we've got a shot at fixing it.

36:50.564 --> 36:52.372
Yeah.

36:52.373 --> 36:54.242
Penny.

36:54.243 --> 36:56.650
She asked me to give you something.

37:29.580 --> 37:33.439
Okay, don't turn down the
temperature without Marina.

37:33.440 --> 37:34.842
If the others aren't ready, it'll...

37:34.844 --> 37:37.046
Kill the seed. I know.

37:37.047 --> 37:39.057
Ah, but it wouldn't hurt to
find the right controls...

37:39.058 --> 37:40.357
Get away from the equipment, sir.

37:40.358 --> 37:43.183
Oh, my.

37:43.184 --> 37:44.512
This is bad.

37:44.513 --> 37:46.680
Jesus, Eliot, what now?

37:46.681 --> 37:49.793
Hello, Marina. Glad you're back with us.

37:49.794 --> 37:53.059
I just need to take
care of this bellhop.

37:53.060 --> 37:54.648
Did you lower the temperature?

37:54.649 --> 37:56.849

George.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.723
I love your blades.

39:52.820 --> 39:54.619
You're a strange girl.

39:54.620 --> 39:56.353
Thank you.

39:57.060 --> 39:59.481
If you don't give us the
correct translations soon,

39:59.482 --> 40:03.480
you'll be a strange fingerless girl.

40:07.989 --> 40:09.488
Paloma.

40:22.450 --> 40:25.548
You do that, the bellhops
will just rip you to shreds.

40:25.549 --> 40:29.469
Yeah, no, we kind of
found their kryptonite.

40:29.470 --> 40:33.339
Well, I'm fine slitting her throat.

40:33.340 --> 40:34.400
Yeah, me too.

40:34.410 --> 40:38.889
Whoa, everybody just calm down.

40:38.890 --> 40:41.779
Okay? Nobody needs to die.

40:41.780 --> 40:43.315
Except the seed

40:43.316 --> 40:45.259
if we keep standing around talking.

40:45.260 --> 40:47.569
See, our friends cranked the AC in here.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.822
So unless you wanna kill the seed,

40:49.823 --> 40:53.949
back off and let us put
it in the bag, stat.

41:01.453 --> 41:03.293
Oh, Christ.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.679
Well, now we've all got a problem.

41:10.090 --> 41:14.599
Guys, hey. Let's not
die or kill the seed.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.882
Kady, Ball,

41:17.883 --> 41:19.518
drop your knives.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.049
Shit.

41:25.050 --> 41:26.149
All right.

41:26.150 --> 41:30.680
Now I think I have a fair solution.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.060
- Hands.
- Come on.

41:35.785 --> 41:37.619
George!

41:41.207 --> 41:44.209
- I got the seed.
- Swallow, Sunshine.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.462
We need to call an ambulance.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.749
The seed. The seed.

41:48.750 --> 41:52.259
It's fine.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.303
But where the hell is the seed, Fen?
