(door shuts)

00:57.767 --> 00:59.300
-Hi, Ma.
-Gimme your watch.

00:59.367 --> 01:02.033
-Oh, sure, what do you want it for?
-I'm working on a magic act

01:02.100 --> 01:03.734
for the talent show at the center.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.667
Abra-kadabra, one, two, three.

01:10.667 --> 01:11.767
(smashes)

01:13.100 --> 01:14.200
Ma!

01:15.233 --> 01:16.233
Relax.

01:16.767 --> 01:19.567
Dorothy, was your card the ace of spades?

01:20.967 --> 01:22.867
Ma, what the hell are you talking about?

01:23.533 --> 01:26.066
I think I got chapters
seven and nine mixed up.

01:29.400 --> 01:30.400
Oh...

01:31.233 --> 01:33.066
This watch is broken.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.900
Ma, Stan gave me that watch
when we got married.

01:37.967 --> 01:40.066
Well, the marriage never worked,
why should the watch?

01:43.934 --> 01:46.967
Anyway, I got bigger problems.
I don't have an act for the talent show.

01:47.033 --> 01:49.266
Talent show? Can I be in it?

01:49.333 --> 01:52.900
Blanche, what you're talented at isn't
generally done on a stage.

01:54.700 --> 01:56.567
This isn't Downtown Saigon.

01:58.233 --> 02:01.433
Ma, will you do me a favor
and forget about the talent show?

02:01.500 --> 02:04.066
You just gonna end up
with egg on your face. Like last year.

02:04.133 --> 02:08.000
-What did you do last year, Sophia?
-What are you, deaf? She just told you.

02:08.066 --> 02:09.233
I tried to juggle eggs.

02:12.767 --> 02:14.400
-Hi, Rose.
-Hi.

02:14.900 --> 02:19.934
-What's the matter? Is something wrong?
-I'm concerned about nuclear war.

02:24.734 --> 02:29.066
And just yesterday, her biggest concern
was whether Bubbles, the chimp

02:29.133 --> 02:31.800
was traveling with Michael Jackson
against his will.

02:34.767 --> 02:38.967
-Tell us what's wrong.
-What does this picture look like?

02:39.033 --> 02:43.467
Me sitting on a throne dressed as
Cleopatra,

02:43.533 --> 02:47.600
watching while two naked men wrestle
to see who gets to make love to me.

02:50.867 --> 02:53.533
-It's the end of the world.
-Only for the loser.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.400
What's this all about?

02:57.467 --> 03:00.433
You know that sunshine cadet troop
I've been helping out with?

03:00.500 --> 03:02.700
One of the girls did this.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.066
She calls it,
"Nuclear Bomb. The day after<i>.</i>"

03:06.133 --> 03:10.000
-She's 8, and this is what's on her mind.
-That's unbelievable.

03:10.066 --> 03:13.600
Three other girls did pictures
just like it.

03:13.667 --> 03:16.700
-I don't understand it.
-It's not so uncommon.

03:17.233 --> 03:22.600
Kids hear about nuclear war on TV.
It's part of their lives.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.567
They can't help but think about it.

03:24.633 --> 03:30.700
When I was 8, I was worried
about the usual childhood things.

03:30.767 --> 03:34.166
How much would the tooth fairy leave me,
what would I get from Santa...

03:36.000 --> 03:39.367
Would I ever be chosen
small curd cottage cheese queen?

03:43.767 --> 03:46.834
I'm only doing this because I have
some more coffee left.

03:47.934 --> 03:49.934
Small curd cottage cheese queen?

03:51.500 --> 03:54.000
It's our town's biggest honor
right after--

03:54.066 --> 03:56.233
-Large curd...
-Large curd...

03:57.700 --> 04:01.533
The point I'm trying to make is
kids should enjoy being kids,

04:01.600 --> 04:06.367
looking forward to their future,
not worrying about the end of the world.

04:07.166 --> 04:11.433
-What's with the long faces?
-We were talking about the bomb.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.767
You haven't even seen my new act.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.700
Ma, we weren't talking about you.

04:17.767 --> 04:21.533
Everybody will talk about me
when they see my new act.

04:24.333 --> 04:28.233
I call my new act Sophia and Sophia.
Get a load of this.

04:28.734 --> 04:31.133
Uh... hi, Sophia.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.600
Oh, hello, Sophia.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.967
How are you feeling today?

04:37.400 --> 04:39.533
Oh, I got a little arthritis in my neck.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.767
I was wondering why my wrist was hurting.
(laughs)

04:47.233 --> 04:51.133
-What do you think?
-You can see your lips moving.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.400
So?

04:52.467 --> 04:55.433
A ventriloquist's lips
aren't supposed to move.

04:55.734 --> 04:56.967
Is that common knowledge?

04:57.767 --> 04:59.266
I'm afraid so, Ma.

04:59.333 --> 05:03.367
Otherwise it would just be you
talking with a sock on your hand.

05:06.033 --> 05:07.467
Tough break, Sophia.

05:07.533 --> 05:12.266
One minute you're entertaining the masses,
the next you're covering a corn pad.

05:13.567 --> 05:15.300
Now you know how Valerie Harper feels.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.467
My turn to cook dinner.
What does everybody want?

05:26.533 --> 05:28.300
Nothing. I'm not hungry.

05:28.367 --> 05:31.967
Don't let this get to you.
You can't do anything.

05:32.834 --> 05:37.900
I've always believed you can fix a problem
if you just put your mind to it.

05:37.967 --> 05:41.967
What will you do,
write a letter to president Reagan?

05:42.033 --> 05:44.934
That would be pretty stupid,
wouldn't it, Blanche?

05:45.500 --> 05:48.367
Reagan's only responsible
for half the problem.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.667
I have to write to Gorbachev, too.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.133
Rose, honey, you can't be serious.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.934
I'm taking my troop on a campout
in two weeks.

05:58.200 --> 06:01.400
I don't want this nuclear nonsense
spoiling our fun.

06:01.834 --> 06:04.667
A well-written, thoughtful,
intelligent letter

06:04.734 --> 06:07.734
to Reagan and Gorbachev
might do the trick.

06:08.266 --> 06:10.967
How many zs are there in "czar"?

06:11.400 --> 06:12.467
I'll look it up.

06:14.667 --> 06:18.133
Why did I make this?
I could've had Rose sit on my hand.

06:19.633 --> 06:22.033
(serene music playing)

06:22.100 --> 06:26.166
To this day,
the ghost of the headless Indian

06:26.233 --> 06:31.033
roams the forest crying out,
"Where is my head?"

06:31.667 --> 06:34.000
"Where is my head?"

06:34.767 --> 06:37.800
If the Indian doesn't have a head,
how can he cry out?

06:39.934 --> 06:42.633
Maybe he talks out of his behind.

06:48.266 --> 06:52.133
Well, the Indian cries out from his heart.
That's the worst kind of crying.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.667
My father's a surgeon.
That's physiologically impossible.

06:56.867 --> 07:00.800
How can we be drawn into the story
if you're misrepresenting the facts?

07:01.700 --> 07:05.333
Honey, it's a make-believe
scary camp out story.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.033
Ooh, real scary.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.433
You want scared, kid? You keep it up.

07:16.734 --> 07:18.000
My mother's a lawyer.

07:18.066 --> 07:20.233
Threaten me again and I'll own your house.

07:22.367 --> 07:24.333
Your father's a doctor,
your mother's a lawyer,

07:24.400 --> 07:26.200
what are you, one of the Cosby Kids?

07:27.533 --> 07:31.500
-This is boring. I want to watch MTV.
-(all) yeah.

07:31.567 --> 07:34.300
We can't watch television,
we're on a camp out.

07:34.367 --> 07:35.433
(girl) No, we're not.

07:36.100 --> 07:40.433
We're in your living room.
The camp out was called off. Remember?

07:40.500 --> 07:42.500
Well, the rain doesn't
have to spoil our fun.

07:42.567 --> 07:45.633
There's nothing we can do
outside that we can't do right here.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.500
You promised us we could pee in the woods.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.300
Get away from that couch.

07:57.900 --> 08:01.934
I have an idea. Who's in the mood
for some real camp out food?

08:02.000 --> 08:05.934
I have beans, I have beef jerkey,
marshmallows--

08:06.000 --> 08:07.200
We want pizza.

08:07.266 --> 08:10.066
Yeah, with artichoke hearts
and shiitake mushrooms.

08:10.133 --> 08:11.800
(all) Yeah.

08:11.867 --> 08:15.000
Girls, would you be terribly
disappointed if I took the troop

08:15.066 --> 08:16.500
down the block for some pizza?

08:16.567 --> 08:17.667
-No.
-No.

08:18.767 --> 08:22.333
All right, everybody, in orderly fashion
let's head for the station wagon.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.667
Now, that's not the way to get
your good behavior badges.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.100
Come on, now, you all know
you use both fingers

08:29.166 --> 08:31.633
for the sunshine salute. Oh.

08:40.433 --> 08:43.600
I'm so glad those little
heathens finally left.

08:43.667 --> 08:46.066
Oh, me too. I am exhausted.

08:46.133 --> 08:49.000
I just don't think I'd have the energy
to raise any more children.

08:49.533 --> 08:52.567
Although I am still in
my child-bearing years.

08:54.533 --> 08:57.066
Sure, Blanche.
You and Emma-Jean Coco.

08:59.066 --> 09:01.734
-(doorbell dings)
-Oh, my God, they're back.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.800
Oh, now I know how the family
in <i>Poltergeist</i> felt.

09:11.066 --> 09:15.700
-Does Rose Nylund live here?
-She just left with her cadet troop.

09:15.767 --> 09:17.100
(Blanche) Could we help you?

09:17.166 --> 09:20.000
I'm Alexi Buvnov
from the Russian embassy.

09:20.066 --> 09:24.200
Premier Gorbachev read Rose's letter
and would like to meet with her.

09:29.934 --> 09:31.500
I'm so sorry.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.533
-I'm so sorry.
-Is Coca-Cola, no?

09:40.367 --> 09:41.633
No need to apologize.

09:41.700 --> 09:45.233
In Moscow, I stand in line six hours
for half as much.

09:46.433 --> 09:49.400
Please make sure Rose receives this note.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.467
You can't be serious.

09:52.533 --> 09:55.166
Why would the premier of Russia
want to see Rose?

09:55.233 --> 09:57.100
He was quite moved by her letter.

09:57.166 --> 10:00.533
He's extending an invitation
to her and her family

10:00.600 --> 10:06.233
to visit Moscow and discuss nuclear
disarmament and world peace.

10:06.734 --> 10:08.800
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

10:11.066 --> 10:12.133
(door shuts)

10:12.467 --> 10:15.033
This has to be a joke.

10:15.100 --> 10:19.633
It isn't. This is an official document
from the premier of Russia.

10:20.133 --> 10:25.800
Why would he want to meet the same woman
who once said, "If Atlantis is lost,

10:25.867 --> 10:28.567
how can Bobby Vinton
appear there twice a year?"

10:32.133 --> 10:35.967
Rose! Rose, the most unbelievable thing
has happened.

10:36.033 --> 10:40.967
Remember that letter you wrote
to Gorbachev? He wants to see you.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.133
What did Reagan say?

10:44.500 --> 10:47.033
Well, nothing. He didn't send a letter.

10:47.533 --> 10:51.033
Well, that is unbelievable.
I wrote him two days earlier.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.100
I did the dumbest thing.

10:54.166 --> 10:58.200
I left this house
forgetting it's a full moon.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.567
Under those conditions,

10:59.633 --> 11:02.700
a sunshine cadet master
must wear full headdress.

11:02.767 --> 11:06.233
Here I come, girls. Woo!

11:07.133 --> 11:08.166
(door shuts)

11:11.900 --> 11:15.567
Kemosabe, I think the world
is in heap big trouble.

11:17.500 --> 11:23.066
(mellow music playing)

11:26.066 --> 11:32.166

11:37.934 --> 11:41.300
<i>We interrupt this dream</i>
<i>for a special news report.</i>

11:43.433 --> 11:44.767
<i>Good evening, I'm Edwin Newman.</i>

11:45.367 --> 11:48.133
The eyes of the entire world
were on Moscow today

11:48.200 --> 11:51.367
as Rose Nylund continued
her mission of peace.

11:51.834 --> 11:56.133
It was 15 days ago that Mrs. Nylund wrote
the now historic letter

11:56.200 --> 11:59.066
that captured premier
Gorbachev's attention.

11:59.467 --> 12:03.967
Today she was in red square capturing the
hearts and minds of the Russian people.

12:04.667 --> 12:05.734
We switch to Moscow.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.934

12:10.600 --> 12:17.467

12:18.633 --> 12:20.000
Thank you.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.367
I want you to know...

12:24.233 --> 12:28.066
<i>Doctor Zhivago</i> is my
favorite movie of all time.

12:32.734 --> 12:39.734

-(crowd) Brezhnev! Brezhnev!

12:39.800 --> 12:42.233
No, no, no. This is Dorothy.

12:45.333 --> 12:50.667
You have a very beautiful country,
and I have enjoyed my stay here.

12:51.133 --> 12:55.867
When it comes down to it, your lives
aren't that different than ours,

12:55.934 --> 12:58.133
except for your toilet paper.

12:59.333 --> 13:02.934
No wonder you people
always look so grouchy.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.800
(cheering)

13:09.233 --> 13:13.100
-And this is my friend, Blanche.
-Hello, you all.

13:13.533 --> 13:15.433
I've had a great time here.

13:15.500 --> 13:21.066
I'd like to express my appreciation
to premier Gorbachev on this special day.

-Thanks for leaving me home.

13:45.867 --> 13:49.533
Lucky, I found this German kid
who flew me to Red Square.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.100
I know you're dying to hear my act,
so I'll get right to it.

13:58.767 --> 14:03.266
I just flew in from Miami,
and, boy, I got to tell you.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.567
Your Moscow is one clean town.

14:05.633 --> 14:10.033
No litter on the streets, and all the bugs
are in the American embassy.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.567
Thank you, Sophia.

14:15.967 --> 14:18.166
And thank you all.

14:18.233 --> 14:21.433
Remember, give peace a chance.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.400
(Rose) The best audience in the world.

14:32.767 --> 14:39.033
-The best audience in the--
-Rose.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.800
-Hi, Dorothy. Hi, Blanche.
-You all right, honey?

14:43.867 --> 14:48.934
Oh, I'm fine. I just had a dream.
We were all in Moscow.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.166
It was snowing,
and we were wearing fake furs.

14:53.433 --> 14:56.433
I guess I'm just nervous
about that press conference tomorrow.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.100
I've never had
a press conference before.

15:01.266 --> 15:06.233
The idea of all those reporters
asking questions scares me to death.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.834
Reporters are just people.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.266
They put on their pants
one leg at a time.

15:12.834 --> 15:15.500
Except for that sportswriter,
Steve Maxwell.

15:17.867 --> 15:22.233
He jumps into both legs all at once...
with a little hop step.

15:28.567 --> 15:31.867
Rose, honey, there is
nothing to be nervous about.

15:31.934 --> 15:36.066
The press wants to meet you because
Gorbachev really respects your views

15:36.133 --> 15:37.533
on world peace.

15:38.667 --> 15:42.333
When you say it out loud,
it really sort of lays there.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.033
Pay attention.

15:46.533 --> 15:49.500
-You're in for a treat.
-Oh, Ma. Not another act.

15:49.567 --> 15:52.000
Not just another act. The act.

15:52.066 --> 15:55.433
I've taken a classic
and reworked it Sophia-style.

15:57.967 --> 16:00.767
("Thanks For The Memories" plays)

16:00.834 --> 16:03.667
♪ <i>Thanks for the Medicare</i> ♪

16:06.667 --> 16:09.000

16:27.734 --> 16:31.133
Okay. What do you think?
I can take the criticism.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.333
Depressing.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Awful.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.800
Stinky.

16:44.166 --> 16:45.900
Go to hell, all of you!

16:51.767 --> 16:54.166
Actually, she took it better
than I expected.

16:55.834 --> 16:59.200
(serene music playing)

17:00.066 --> 17:03.433
I've been talking to that good-looking
reporter.

17:03.500 --> 17:07.367
He told me some interesting things
about Russia.

17:07.767 --> 17:13.500
It snows there in the summertime,
and they don't have many attractive women.

17:13.567 --> 17:16.800
When we go to Russia,
I'll have my pick of any man there,

17:16.867 --> 17:18.967
and you can make a snowman in June.

17:27.367 --> 17:30.100
Uh... we can start
the press conference now.

17:30.166 --> 17:33.567
-Where is Rose?
-She's picking up her cadet troop.

17:33.633 --> 17:34.734
That's adorable.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.567
She wants to share this moment
with friends her age.

17:38.633 --> 17:41.767
-You must be proud of your daughter.
-My daughter?

17:41.834 --> 17:45.367
How old do you think Rose is?

17:45.433 --> 17:49.133
Based upon her letter,
we figure 9 or 10.

17:50.734 --> 17:51.734
No?

17:52.367 --> 17:56.900
Uh... to be perfectly honest, she's--
closer to 10.

17:58.333 --> 18:02.133
Blanche, let's go in the kitchen.
Anything we can get you?

18:02.200 --> 18:04.400
Coffee, tea, a pair of Levi's?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.567
That solves the mystery.
They think Rose is a kid.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.900
What will we do?

18:13.967 --> 18:16.667
If she reads that letter,
she'll humiliate herself.

18:16.734 --> 18:20.033
-We can't tell those Russians the truth.
-Why not?

18:20.100 --> 18:25.867
They'll use it as propaganda
that all Americans are as dumb as Rose.

18:28.266 --> 18:31.266
That would rock the foundation
of our government,

18:31.333 --> 18:35.400
undermine our leaders,
and potentially topple our democracy.

18:35.467 --> 18:38.767
<i>Rocky IV</i> had a profound affect on you,
didn't it?

18:39.667 --> 18:42.266
Come on. We have to tell him the truth.

18:42.333 --> 18:47.633
-Hi, girls. I hope we're not late.
-We have something to tell you.

18:47.700 --> 18:50.533
This is so amazing.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.567
To think I'm giving a press conference.
Next week, we go to Moscow.

18:54.633 --> 18:58.100
-Can you believe it, Dorothy?
-No, but I can't believe

18:58.166 --> 19:02.533
god wanted Jerry Falwell to go down that
water slide in a cheap suit.

19:06.767 --> 19:10.100
-Rose...
-I know I'm babbling, but I'm so excited.

19:10.166 --> 19:13.967
Maybe I should open with a joke.
My jokes are boring.

19:14.033 --> 19:16.100
Maybe I should tell a story.

19:16.166 --> 19:20.066
Like when uncle Gustaf got drunk
and tried to milk a porcupine.

19:20.633 --> 19:24.767
-Rose, we have to tell you something.
-There has been a misunderstanding.

19:24.834 --> 19:29.266
We just found out everybody thinks
the letter you sent to Gorbachev was...

19:29.667 --> 19:31.600
written by a 9-year-old girl.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.367
You can't be serious.

19:36.734 --> 19:41.500
Oh, the troop is back.
Which one is little Rose?

19:42.367 --> 19:44.967
This is little Rose right here.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.834
I will inform the press
we're about to begin.

19:49.433 --> 19:54.166
-This is so embarrassing.
-Just let Linda read your letter.

19:54.233 --> 19:57.433
-Nobody will be the wiser.
-Is it all right?

19:57.500 --> 19:59.633
Gee, I don't know. I guess so.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.400
I was afraid I wouldn't
get my moonbeam badge.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.934
You said a sunshine cadet never lies.

20:11.934 --> 20:15.133
Ladies and gentlemen,
recently I brought a letter

20:15.200 --> 20:17.333
to the attention of our premier.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.166
He was so moved
by its childlike simplicity,

20:20.233 --> 20:23.567
he requested to meet
the little girl who wrote it.

20:23.633 --> 20:28.934
I'd like to introduce you to that
extraordinary 9-year-old girl right now.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.900
Rose Nylund.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.533
-I'm Rose Nylund.
-Oh, boy.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.467
-I wrote the letter.
-Oh, boy.

20:43.667 --> 20:46.467
I guess there's been
some misunderstanding...

20:47.567 --> 20:50.300
but a sunshine cadet never lies.

20:50.367 --> 20:51.967
I have two announcements.

20:52.033 --> 20:57.000
This press conference is canceled, and
I'm proud to be Miami's newest citizen.

20:57.066 --> 21:00.367
If anyone wants to reach me,
my name is Dave.

21:06.533 --> 21:09.100
Honey, that took a lot of courage.

21:09.667 --> 21:11.467
-You ok?
-No!

21:18.200 --> 21:22.667
-This is the worst day of my life.
-Honey, it's not that bad.

21:22.734 --> 21:28.567
I made a fool of myself
in front of the press.

21:28.633 --> 21:30.133
What will I tell my mother?

21:30.200 --> 21:33.300
Your mother's from St. Olaf.
She'll understand.

21:35.166 --> 21:36.233
I'm just stupid.

21:36.834 --> 21:43.233
A dimwitted, dumb, simple-minded,
grade A Minnesota chucklehead.

21:43.834 --> 21:48.433
But... the important thing is
you're our chucklehead.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.567
We wouldn't trade you in

21:51.633 --> 21:55.000
for any other chucklehead
in the whole wide world.

21:55.066 --> 21:56.467
Why don't you take it, Dorothy?

21:58.700 --> 22:02.467
What you did was great. It was historic.

22:02.533 --> 22:07.233
Your words managed to move the heart
of a major world leader.

22:07.300 --> 22:11.700
I'd like to hear those words.
Read us that letter.

22:11.767 --> 22:14.033
I never will. It's too embarrassing.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.467
You said today's the worst.
What can you lose?

22:17.533 --> 22:19.567
I'll never read this letter.

22:20.333 --> 22:21.834
Will you let me read it?

22:21.900 --> 22:25.500
Kick me while I'm down.
I should get used to it.

22:27.767 --> 22:30.433
"Dear Mr. Gorbachev,
my name's Rose Nylund.

22:30.767 --> 22:34.233
I'm writing because I'm worried
about nuclear war.

22:34.300 --> 22:38.033
I hear there are enough bombs
to blow the world up a hundred times,

22:38.100 --> 22:39.400
and it scares me.

22:39.467 --> 22:41.934
It scares the girls in my cadet troop too.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.800
They talk about what they'll be
if they grow up, not when.

22:49.066 --> 22:52.166
That's why I'm asking you
to please unplug your bombs.

22:52.734 --> 22:56.600
I'll bet my bottom dollar,
or in your case, ruble.

22:57.700 --> 23:00.734
That if you called president Reagan,
he'd do the same thing.

23:00.800 --> 23:05.100
Someone has to be first.
Thank you. Your friend, Rose Nylund.

23:05.734 --> 23:09.633
P.S.
Don't call the president in the afternoon.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.700
I hear that's when he takes naps."

23:19.867 --> 23:22.934
Honey, that was really beautiful.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.200
It's a shame more people
don't think like 9-year-olds.

23:26.900 --> 23:29.033
(telephone rings)

23:30.400 --> 23:33.600
Hello. Yes, she is. Here, Rose. For you.

23:36.767 --> 23:37.767
Hello.

23:39.133 --> 23:40.233
Yes.

23:41.867 --> 23:43.300
It's the President!

23:44.433 --> 23:46.033
Yes, Mr. President.

23:46.667 --> 23:47.800
Thank you.

23:48.367 --> 23:49.633
Goodbye.

23:50.467 --> 23:52.467
The president loved my letter.

23:52.900 --> 23:55.266
I've got to write this down
in my diary right now.

23:58.867 --> 24:01.800
I just figured out my act
for the talent contest.

24:01.867 --> 24:03.200
-What?
-What, Sophie?

24:03.266 --> 24:05.166
My Reagan impression.

24:13.767 --> 24:19.500
(theme music playing)
