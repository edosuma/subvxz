was able to locate

00:23.506 --> 00:25.197

Maybe we're gonna get
an update on QuoVadis.

00:43.793 --> 00:45.318
There's nothing to update.

00:45.328 --> 00:46.453
QuoVadis is dead.

00:46.463 --> 00:47.520
We killed it.

00:47.530 --> 00:49.732
Gloriously.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.802
Take your seats, please.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.796
I called you here today because we have

00:56.806 --> 01:01.801
an unusual patient to discuss:
Chastain Park Memorial.

01:01.811 --> 01:06.005
Our speaker will explain exactly
how Chastain fell victim

01:06.015 --> 01:08.575
to an unscrupulous device company.

01:08.585 --> 01:11.354
Former QuoVadis device rep,
Julian Booth.

01:19.328 --> 01:21.731
Did you know?

01:23.165 --> 01:25.001
I thought she was dead.

01:26.569 --> 01:28.327
Thank you, Dr. Bell, for having me here.

01:28.337 --> 01:31.398
I look out today

01:31.408 --> 01:33.700
and I see dedicated doctors and nurses

01:33.710 --> 01:36.736
who come to work each day
to heal their patients.

01:36.746 --> 01:39.271
That was my mission as well.

01:39.281 --> 01:42.842
But, like Chastain,
I was misled by QuoVadis.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.445
The results were harm

01:45.455 --> 01:48.014
and, in some cases...

01:48.024 --> 01:49.358
death.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.619
And the most frightening thing is

01:52.629 --> 01:54.120
the fraud committed by QuoVadis

01:54.130 --> 01:55.788
was far too easy to accomplish.

01:55.798 --> 01:59.291
And that is why I'm here today...
so that, moving forward,

01:59.301 --> 02:01.428
we can make sure the devices

02:01.438 --> 02:04.063
put into Chastain patients heal

02:04.073 --> 02:06.399
instead of harm.

02:06.409 --> 02:09.368
I can't believe that you're here.

02:09.377 --> 02:11.404
What happened to you?

02:11.414 --> 02:14.073
Gordon's bodyguards were following me.

02:14.083 --> 02:15.642
I lost control of the car

02:15.652 --> 02:18.578
and I crashed into the river.

02:18.588 --> 02:22.549
Almost drowned, but managed
to get out and swim to safety.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.612
Yeah, but where have you been
this whole time?

02:24.623 --> 02:26.986
Hiding out in my parents' house
in Savannah.

02:26.996 --> 02:29.556
Why didn't you just let me know
where you were?

02:29.566 --> 02:31.824
I was afraid of what Gordon would do

02:31.834 --> 02:33.893
if he found out where I was.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.595
And I...

02:35.605 --> 02:38.501

11:00.642 --> 11:02.111

ever since I told you
how I feel about you.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.943

11:10.953 --> 11:13.079
- a lot going on.
- Hey.

Hey.

11:14.790 --> 11:17.283
Is that Valerie's blood work?

11:18.594 --> 11:19.952
- Yeah.
- Oh.

11:19.962 --> 11:22.664
Cool. Well,
I will let you get back to it.

11:25.034 --> 11:27.159
Valerie's EKG is normal.

11:27.169 --> 11:29.528
So her heart is fine.

11:29.538 --> 11:31.495
What if the intermittent
shortness of breath

11:31.506 --> 11:34.333
and dizziness is a lung issue...
a pulmonary embolism?

11:34.343 --> 11:35.801
Well, Valerie also has calf pain.

11:35.811 --> 11:37.503
Maybe it's a DVT.

11:37.513 --> 11:39.885
Well, we should get a CT angio
to see what's going on.

11:39.896 --> 11:42.308
No, I-I think a CT is premature.

a well-timed U-turn,
creating my own lane.

- Fine. You know.

21:23.932 --> 21:26.858
They won't have the results
till tomorrow.

21:26.868 --> 21:28.293
So, um, see you at home?

21:28.303 --> 21:30.128
Yeah, yeah. Call if there's anything.

21:30.138 --> 21:31.429
JESSIE: Oh, we'll be fine.

21:31.439 --> 21:33.298
I got this guy to wait
on me hand and foot.

21:33.308 --> 21:35.466
- Yeah, you do.
- We'll make dinner.

21:35.476 --> 21:37.913
- Love you.
- Love you.

21:39.648 --> 21:41.306
KYLE: I'm thinking lobster thermidor.

21:41.316 --> 21:43.384
JESSIE: (LAUGHS) I bet you are.

21:45.821 --> 21:47.823
(KNOCKING)

21:51.559 --> 21:55.320
I was a jerk. You were sweet,
and it's not who I am.

21:55.330 --> 21:59.167
Not that that's an excuse,
but can I come in?

22:01.269 --> 22:04.062
We should have started
with this conversation

22:04.072 --> 22:06.932
and not, you know, sex.

22:06.942 --> 22:09.400
But it happened,
and we can't take it back.

22:09.410 --> 22:11.402
- Would you?
- No.

22:11.412 --> 22:13.404
No. That's-that's not the point.

22:13.414 --> 22:17.408
The point is you were great and kind.

22:17.418 --> 22:20.445
I want to take you out for dinner.

22:20.455 --> 22:22.313
My treat.

22:22.323 --> 22:25.984
A thank you for taking care of Bailey.

22:25.994 --> 22:28.787
And time for us
to talk about everything.

22:28.797 --> 22:31.089
You, me, what the hell
we're gonna do with our lives.

22:31.099 --> 22:32.624
Mostly mine.

22:32.634 --> 22:35.026
- Before you say no...
- I wasn't gonna say no.

22:35.036 --> 22:37.963
Good.

22:37.973 --> 22:39.931
How long do you think
he'll be staying with you?

22:39.941 --> 22:42.467
You know Kyle. When things
get tough, he'll bail.

22:42.477 --> 22:45.804
Not too long ago, the same
could have been said about me.

22:45.814 --> 22:49.174
Well, you wanted to change. He doesn't.

22:49.184 --> 22:52.277
Anyway, enough about my dad.

22:52.287 --> 22:53.679
What about yours?

22:53.689 --> 22:54.813
I heard rumors.

22:54.823 --> 22:56.347
(GROANS) They're true.

22:56.357 --> 22:59.851
He's leaving Chastain
to pursue a new passion.

22:59.861 --> 23:03.454
I don't know. I should be happy.

23:03.464 --> 23:06.658
But part of me just feels like...

23:06.668 --> 23:08.559
Like he's leaving you again.

23:08.569 --> 23:10.238
Yeah.

23:11.539 --> 23:12.964
VALERIE: I need help!

23:12.974 --> 23:16.902
(COUGHING)

23:16.912 --> 23:18.463
CONRAD: Valerie, what's going on?

23:18.474 --> 23:21.142
- I'm scared I don't know what's going on.
- NIC: She has hemoptysis.

23:21.153 --> 23:22.674
She needs a CT now.

23:22.684 --> 23:24.575
(VALERIE GROANING)

23:24.585 --> 23:26.678
There's a sharp pain in my stomach.

23:26.688 --> 23:29.815
Add an abdomen pelvis sequence.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.327
(BEEPING)

23:35.096 --> 23:37.022
Valerie doesn't have a uterus.

23:37.032 --> 23:39.057
ALEC: Incredible. What's going on?

23:39.067 --> 23:41.092
Her ovaries aren't cystic,
and there's no torsion.

23:41.102 --> 23:44.529
What if they're masses?
They are smaller.

23:44.539 --> 23:47.065
Inflammation caused by cancer
could explain the DVT

23:47.075 --> 23:48.266
and the abdominal pain.

23:48.276 --> 23:49.945
We need to schedule a biopsy.

23:56.752 --> 23:59.010
These are cancerous cells.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.679
Well, that explains
the pelvic pain and DVT.

24:01.689 --> 24:04.182
Wait, I see sertoli cells.

24:04.192 --> 24:07.786
Seminiferous tubules.

24:07.796 --> 24:11.967
Are you saying our female
gymnast has testicular cancer?

24:17.405 --> 24:19.464
Did you get sneaky
and go behind my back?

24:19.474 --> 24:22.467
I was supposed to pay
for dinner. That was the deal.

24:22.477 --> 24:26.271
Okay, the chef remembered me
from the ER on Valentine's Day.

24:26.281 --> 24:27.773
I saved his pinky, which meant

24:27.783 --> 24:29.574
- he could cook dinner for his wife.
- (LAUGHS)

24:29.584 --> 24:31.542
He insisted on covering our meal.

24:31.552 --> 24:34.145
That's romantic-adjacent.

24:34.155 --> 24:36.414
Pretty impressive.

24:36.424 --> 24:39.384
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

24:39.394 --> 24:42.287
Hey, can I ask you about your wedding?

24:42.297 --> 24:45.456
I've been secretly hoping
I wasn't the reason

24:45.466 --> 24:46.667
it all blew up.

24:48.503 --> 24:50.962
You know, if I was..

24:50.972 --> 24:53.598
truly in love with Priya,

24:53.608 --> 24:56.101
I wouldn't have had feelings for you.

24:56.111 --> 24:58.837
Now, what I don't know is...

24:58.847 --> 25:00.939
I did and I do

25:00.949 --> 25:02.951
have feelings for you.

25:05.954 --> 25:07.178
And now you're back.

25:07.188 --> 25:10.949
With a job offer from Marshall Winthrop.

25:10.959 --> 25:13.451
I don't know if I should take it.

25:13.461 --> 25:16.321
To be honest, it scares me a little.

25:16.331 --> 25:17.465
Wait, that's a good thing.

25:19.200 --> 25:22.037
If it doesn't scare you,
it's probably not worth doing.

25:26.808 --> 25:30.035
It's our job as parents
to push our kids.

25:30.045 --> 25:32.137
You tell your husband
to get on the train,

25:32.147 --> 25:35.923
- but let you drive.
- Oh, yeah.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.696
Oh, I'm so sorry.

25:37.707 --> 25:39.984
You came to see Mr. Winthrop,
and I talked your ear off.

25:39.995 --> 25:42.097
Oh, that's okay. Is-is he available?

25:42.108 --> 25:43.997
Uh, well, you don't have an appointment,

25:44.008 --> 25:46.117
and he has a board meeting soon, so...

25:46.127 --> 25:48.634
Well, good news is
I have another appointment

25:48.645 --> 25:51.322
and a board meeting myself,
so I'll just be five minutes.

25:52.522 --> 25:55.837
Not to mention my daughter
is dating his son.

25:59.611 --> 26:01.732
Mr. Winthrop, I put Mr. Nevin

26:01.742 --> 26:03.801
- on the schedule for a quick hello.
- Hey, there.

26:03.811 --> 26:06.947
Kyle Nevin. Nic's father.

26:07.556 --> 26:10.041
- It's great to finally meet you.
- A pleasure.

26:10.051 --> 26:13.979
Your daughter is the best thing
that's ever happened to my son.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.247
Well, what, uh, what brings you by?

26:16.257 --> 26:18.249
Marshall...

26:18.259 --> 26:22.753
yeah, I've spent my entire career
building a brand with little regard

26:22.763 --> 26:24.322
for anyone other than myself.

26:24.332 --> 26:27.425
It's always been about me. My legacy.

26:27.435 --> 26:30.428
Now I find myself wanting to give back.

26:30.438 --> 26:33.498
So I'm on the cusp
of revolutionizing the way

26:33.508 --> 26:35.700
doctors communicate with their patients.

26:35.710 --> 26:37.668
It's a very personal venture for me.

26:37.678 --> 26:40.108
I'd like to keep it in the family.

26:40.119 --> 26:43.274
So, I'd love to explore a partnership...

26:43.284 --> 26:45.210
if you're interested.

26:45.220 --> 26:48.179
Unfortunately, I'm not looking

26:48.189 --> 26:50.916
for new business opportunities.

26:50.926 --> 26:53.919
But I wish you the best of luck.

26:53.929 --> 26:55.853
Ah.

26:55.863 --> 26:58.556
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

26:58.566 --> 27:00.291
Thank you.

27:00.301 --> 27:02.904
Thank you for your time.

27:04.372 --> 27:06.774
Hey, you know where to find me.

27:08.809 --> 27:11.469
We got to figure out
Brett's hypertension pronto.

27:11.479 --> 27:13.404
We had to put him into
a medically-induced coma.

27:13.414 --> 27:16.074
Well, you just rescanned him.
Tell me you learned something.

27:16.084 --> 27:18.209
A mass in his right adrenal.

27:18.219 --> 27:19.978
I think it's a pheochromocytoma.

27:19.988 --> 27:22.948
I mean, it produces hormones
that spike blood pressure.

27:22.958 --> 27:27.138
We paged the lab to add on plasma
and urine metanephrines to confirm.

27:27.149 --> 27:29.420
- How bad is this?
- Well, it's-it's bad.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.489
AUSTIN: Look at that. The
aneurysm is dissecting

27:31.499 --> 27:34.059
and blocking flow to the
kidneys, so if we don't operate,

27:34.069 --> 27:35.927
we risk organ failure
and possibly death.

27:35.937 --> 27:38.829
If they operate on Brett
with an uncontrolled pheo,

27:38.839 --> 27:40.431
he could have a hypertensive crisis,

27:40.441 --> 27:43.634
leading to a stroke, a brain bleed or...

27:43.644 --> 27:45.236
rupture of his aneurysm.

27:45.246 --> 27:46.972
This is an impossible choice.

27:46.982 --> 27:49.774
And it's-it's one we don't get to make.

27:49.784 --> 27:51.509
This is up to his power of attorney.

27:51.519 --> 27:53.955
Did he list one on his intake?

27:59.460 --> 28:02.020
He did.

28:02.030 --> 28:04.032
You.

28:09.137 --> 28:11.096
My ovaries are actually testicles?

28:11.106 --> 28:14.832
That never descended.
It's a genetic condition

28:14.842 --> 28:17.835
known as androgen
insensitivity syndrome.

28:17.845 --> 28:20.538
The disorder prevented
your male DNA from processing

28:20.548 --> 28:22.473
testosterone in utero.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.309
And because you could
only process estrogen,

28:24.319 --> 28:26.511
you were born with external
female characteristics.

28:26.521 --> 28:30.715
- But now one of those testicles
has cancer. -ALEC: Yes.

28:30.725 --> 28:33.384
But the good news is
the cancer didn't get far.

28:33.394 --> 28:35.553
CONRAD: Once we remove your testes,

28:35.563 --> 28:39.390
you have a high chance of full recovery.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.337
And knowing you, cancer's
the underdog in this fight.

28:43.704 --> 28:46.561
What does this all make me? Who am I?

28:46.572 --> 28:48.566
The same person you've always been.

28:49.615 --> 28:52.252
Did the testosterone give me an edge?

28:52.263 --> 28:54.946
Then the Olympic committee
could deem me ineligible.

28:54.957 --> 28:56.874
I just traded one obstacle for another.

28:56.884 --> 28:59.077
Look, we've only been together
a couple days,

28:59.087 --> 29:02.147
all right? But game recognizes game.

29:02.157 --> 29:04.682
You're like me. You break down doors.

29:04.692 --> 29:07.218
When one closes,
we climb through windows.

29:07.228 --> 29:09.254
Windows won't open,
we barrel through the ceiling.

29:09.264 --> 29:11.989
We chew up obstacles and
find a way to move forward

29:11.999 --> 29:13.024
no matter what.

29:13.034 --> 29:14.492
None of that changes,

29:14.502 --> 29:16.071
unless you let it.

29:18.005 --> 29:21.066
So what's it gonna be, Valerie?

29:21.076 --> 29:23.068
Let's remove these bad boys.

29:23.078 --> 29:24.845
I have the Olympics to train for.

29:29.517 --> 29:32.443
What man puts his life into the hands

29:32.453 --> 29:34.779
of the woman who broke his heart?

29:34.789 --> 29:37.282
A man capable of forgiveness.

29:37.292 --> 29:40.085
I guess that's true.

29:40.095 --> 29:43.254
I don't know why he's forgiven me.

29:43.264 --> 29:45.723
What am I supposed to do, Randolph?

29:45.733 --> 29:47.725
There is no logical choice.

29:47.735 --> 29:51.362
Well, you know, sometimes
logic just goes out the window,

29:51.372 --> 29:53.040
and you have to trust your instincts.

29:56.544 --> 29:59.147
I know Brett wouldn't want to wait.

30:00.715 --> 30:03.541
Send him to the OR.

30:03.551 --> 30:05.052
Okay.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.664
(BUZZING)

30:19.167 --> 30:22.160
MINA: Micah, hi.

30:22.170 --> 30:24.562
Wow. I'd nearly given up on you.

30:24.572 --> 30:28.309
I've been considering your proposal.

30:29.810 --> 30:31.979
We need to talk.

30:34.349 --> 30:35.516
I know.

30:37.352 --> 30:39.744
I assume you have your answer?

30:39.754 --> 30:42.580
Well, your record appears
to be different from the man

30:42.590 --> 30:44.582
you say you are today.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.984
I don't take gambles on men
I don't know. Not anymore.

30:46.994 --> 30:50.255
Well, I'm sorry you won't be
working for me.

30:50.265 --> 30:53.491
That doesn't mean
I won't take your money.

30:53.501 --> 30:56.994
I want to start a nonprofit
that will hold device companies

30:57.004 --> 30:59.096
like QuoVadis and the FDA accountable.

30:59.106 --> 31:02.510
Something that will become
a solution to this epidemic.

31:03.944 --> 31:05.946
I knew I was right about you.

31:10.451 --> 31:13.611
JESSIE: Hey, w-what's going on?
Why do I need to be in the ER?

31:13.621 --> 31:16.147
Your potassium levels are elevated.

31:16.157 --> 31:18.283
Okay, well, what does that mean?
Am I gonna be okay?

31:18.293 --> 31:22.115
Um, we just need to try
to normalize your levels.

31:22.126 --> 31:24.389
Here, why don't you lie down here.

31:24.399 --> 31:26.988
Hang a liter and let's get her
up on the monitors.

31:26.999 --> 31:29.634
I need to talk to Kyle for a second.

31:34.437 --> 31:36.734
You pitched your thing to Marshall.

31:36.744 --> 31:38.869
You used my name
and put my boyfriend's father

31:38.879 --> 31:41.071
in the position to have to
reject your offer.

31:41.081 --> 31:43.408
I mean, do you see how weird
this is for everybody?

31:43.418 --> 31:45.876
- He struck up a conversation.
- You orchestrated this.

31:45.886 --> 31:48.416
- That's why you're at Chastain.
- Don't you do this.

31:48.427 --> 31:50.481
- I am here for Jessie.
- You called me weeks

31:50.491 --> 31:52.077
before Jessie needed to leave rehab.

31:52.088 --> 31:54.292
You knew that Conrad's father
was chairman of the board,

31:54.303 --> 31:57.465
and when I didn't return your call,
you just found another way in.

31:57.476 --> 31:59.278
It doesn't mean I'm not here for her.

32:02.270 --> 32:04.829
Okay, yes, look...

32:04.839 --> 32:07.698
I know I crossed a line.

32:07.708 --> 32:10.034
But I'm telling you,
if this app takes off...

32:10.044 --> 32:11.669
(NIC SIGHS)

32:11.679 --> 32:13.789
we'll never have to worry
about money again.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.441
- I did this for the two of you.
- I can't...

32:16.451 --> 32:19.086
It could be my legacy.

32:20.455 --> 32:22.046
You think this app

32:22.341 --> 32:23.976
is gonna change your legacy?

32:24.759 --> 32:27.685
Growing up, our school
didn't have your number

32:27.695 --> 32:29.909
for emergencies,
they had our neighbor's.

32:29.920 --> 32:33.134
Even the nurse knew that our father
couldn't be trusted to be there.

32:33.145 --> 32:36.361
There isn't one person who
relies on you in a time of need.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.806
That is your legacy.

32:45.313 --> 32:48.406
Look, Jessie needs stability, okay?

32:48.416 --> 32:52.253
If that's not you, just leave.

For her, for you.

33:02.997 --> 33:05.232
You're just gonna have
to give me a shot to prove it.

33:15.476 --> 33:18.436
- You mind if I join you?
- Oh, I prefer it.

33:18.446 --> 33:20.438
There aren't enough bones
in this surgery.

33:20.448 --> 33:22.139
I'm bound to get lost in the weeds.

33:22.149 --> 33:24.275
Well, I can walk you through it
if that's helpful.

33:24.285 --> 33:27.588
It is. And thanks again
for being here for me.

33:29.624 --> 33:32.082
Well, Brett's under, his blood
pressure seems to be holding.

33:32.092 --> 33:33.918
So we're already off to a great start.

33:33.928 --> 33:37.187

helpful? Honesty.

So, by manipulating the pheo,
it could release

33:45.440 --> 33:47.832
even more "catecholamine"

33:49.677 --> 33:53.304
resulting in a stroke or rupture.

33:56.784 --> 33:58.786
Now what's Dr. Austin doing?

34:00.321 --> 34:01.846
He's trying to get control of the distal

34:01.856 --> 34:04.214
and proximal abdominal aorta,
and this way,

34:04.224 --> 34:06.451
if the aneurysm ruptures,
he can clamp it off immediately

34:06.461 --> 34:08.553
so Brett doesn't bleed out.

- If he can't get control?

He will. These are

gonna stroke out. We need to abort

34:31.750 --> 34:34.889

shot at this. It's now or never.

that a teeny, tiny part

35:12.960 --> 35:15.052
of what you said was helpful.

Oh, yeah?

- I'll have to devote everything

do things differently, right?

shouldn't work together again.

I was talking to Jessie. Do you think

37:29.496 --> 37:33.390
her kidney damage
is related to her opioid use?

37:33.400 --> 37:36.160
No. It's most likely
experimental meds she was given
