00:08.409 --> 00:10.342
- ¶

00:10.344 --> 00:12.611
- All right, guys, thanks
for helping me figure out

00:12.613 --> 00:14.113
a new superhero catchphrase.

00:14.115 --> 00:18.150
How about, "You just
got saved--to the Max!"

00:18.152 --> 00:20.352
- Nice!
- I think it's great!

00:20.354 --> 00:21.520
- Oh, you like it?

00:21.522 --> 00:22.388
That's off the list.

00:22.390 --> 00:27.326
- There's only one catchphrase
in this family, baby.

00:27.328 --> 00:27.926
[whooshing]

00:27.928 --> 00:31.663
- Saying "baby" all
the time isn't a catchphrase.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.365
- Max, stop what
you're doing.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.701
We're at a ThunderTwin
"orange" alert.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.669
- We're outta taco sauce?

00:37.671 --> 00:38.971
- No, that's magenta.

00:38.973 --> 00:41.373
Learn the color
alert system.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.510
Look, they've ranked all
the Z Force hopefuls.

00:44.512 --> 00:45.978
- How are we behind
Nightlight?

00:45.980 --> 00:48.213
She is useless
during the day.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.648
- We're in last place
because, somehow,

00:49.650 --> 00:51.183
we're the only ones
who didn't do

00:51.185 --> 00:53.452
a bonus assignment
called "The Li'l Z's."

00:53.454 --> 00:54.286
Look.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.055
- MAX: "Li'l Z's
Mentor Program"?

00:56.057 --> 00:57.589
- We're supposed to submit
a video of ourselves

00:57.591 --> 01:00.392
helping a young supe take
their powers to the next level.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.394
And the more impressive
your Li'l Z,

01:02.396 --> 01:03.128
the more points you get.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.397
- How come we didn't
know about this until now?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.733
- I might know why.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.404
- MALE VOICE: This is
an important message

01:12.406 --> 01:14.440
for Max
and Phoebe Thunderman

01:14.442 --> 01:16.108
about the Li'l Z's Program.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.544
- Hm, sounds important.

01:18.546 --> 01:21.280
On to adventure!

01:21.282 --> 01:23.549
- Colosso, not cool.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.651
- Uh-oh, time to fly.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.287
So long, suckers!

01:28.289 --> 01:29.988
- We're not letting
him leave, are we?

01:29.990 --> 01:31.590
- No!
- [electrical zapping]

01:31.592 --> 01:34.026
- [balloon pops]
- COLOSSO: Mayday!

01:34.028 --> 01:34.693
- [heavy thud]

01:34.695 --> 01:36.261
- Phoebe, we need
to get those points

01:36.263 --> 01:38.297
to get back in the running
for the Z Force.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.498
- But we only have
two days left.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.600
Where are we gonna
find a young supe

01:41.602 --> 01:42.367
we can train and mentor?

01:42.369 --> 01:45.104
- You know, there are two
talented supes in this house

01:45.106 --> 01:46.638
who'd be happy to help you.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.575
- Uh, sorry, guys,
it's called the Li'l Z's,

01:49.577 --> 01:52.077
not the Old
and Retired Z's.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.546
- Max, they're not
talking about themselves.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.347
- Actually--

01:55.349 --> 01:57.316
- You are not talking
about yourselves.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.617
- We meant
Billy and Nora.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.486
We've upped their
superhero training

02:00.488 --> 02:02.020
and they are
doing great.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.589
I'm sure either
one of them

02:03.591 --> 02:05.657
would love to be
your Li'l Z.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.059
- As would your mother.

02:07.061 --> 02:09.628
- All right,
here we go. Bye.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.064
- I'm worried about Mom.

02:12.066 --> 02:13.632
But Dad makes
a really good point.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.801
- Yeah. But do we take
Billy or Nora?

02:15.803 --> 02:20.772
- Help! Nora! This
bucket's attacking me!

02:21.675 --> 02:23.775
- So, we're going
with Nora, right?

02:23.777 --> 02:25.711
- Definitely Nora.

02:26.714 --> 02:27.479
- "Hi, Max."

02:27.481 --> 02:30.516
"Get outta
my room, Phoebe."

02:30.518 --> 02:33.252
- Aw, look at our
sweet little angel

02:33.254 --> 02:35.821
playing with her--
[screams]

02:35.823 --> 02:39.758
Oh! Why are your
toys so pointy?

02:39.760 --> 02:43.095
Young lady, you promised
you'd pick up your toys.

02:43.097 --> 02:46.665
- I know, but it's
so much easier not to.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.700
- Chloe, if you say
you're gonna

02:48.702 --> 02:50.135
do something,
you do it.

02:50.137 --> 02:53.639
A ThunderPromise is as
strong as ThunderTanium.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.707
- Okay, I'll clean up.

02:55.709 --> 02:56.675
- Wahoo!

02:56.677 --> 02:58.810
- Oh, no,
that sounds like...

02:58.812 --> 03:00.145
- CHLOE:
Blobbin!

03:00.147 --> 03:02.281
- Greetings, ThunderFam.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.816
- Are you floating?
- Floating?

03:04.818 --> 03:07.286
That would be crazy.
[chuckling]

03:07.288 --> 03:10.756
No, I'm on
an invisible skateboard.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.226
- Blobbin, do the thing!
Do the thing!

03:14.228 --> 03:15.494
- Oh, Chloe,
he's probably tired.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.130
- Hi-ya! Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

03:18.132 --> 03:19.631
So, listen...
[chuckling]

03:19.633 --> 03:22.568
I'm here because
my scientists at BlobCo

03:22.570 --> 03:24.303
started a fashion division.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.671
- Oh, you're making
clothes now?

03:25.673 --> 03:28.607
Is there a "family" discount?
- BARB & BLOBBIN: [laughing]

03:28.609 --> 03:31.543
- No. Anyway,
I want ThunderMan

03:31.545 --> 03:33.612
to be the face
of our new Fall line.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.281
- Oh, Blobbin,
I mean, I'm flattered.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.183
But, you know, I'm retired
as a superhero.

03:38.185 --> 03:41.753
- Oh, but you've been
the face of so many products.

03:41.755 --> 03:42.688
- That is true.

03:42.690 --> 03:43.722
Hello, I'm ThunderMan.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.124
You know, after saving
the town from villains,

03:46.126 --> 03:48.594
I like to save my face
from razor burn--

03:48.596 --> 03:52.798
with ThunderMan's
After Save lotion.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.199
[chuckling]

03:54.201 --> 03:55.601
Oh, ho, ho, ho,
ho, ho.

03:55.603 --> 03:59.438
Ah. The burn means
it's working.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.840
ThunderMan's
After Save!

04:01.842 --> 04:05.444
- Oh, you can
sell anything.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.179
- Well, I am
pretty amazing.

04:07.181 --> 04:09.715
- Then you promise
you'll help me?

04:09.717 --> 04:11.316
- I promise.
- BARB: Oh!

04:11.318 --> 04:13.185
- Where do I sign?
- Right here--

04:13.187 --> 04:14.886
on this invisible
contract.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.521
- Oh?

04:16.523 --> 04:18.357
- [chuckling]
I'm kidding.

04:18.359 --> 04:22.194
There's no such thing
as invisible paper--

04:22.196 --> 04:24.229
yet.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.365
- Hey, Nora, um,

04:26.367 --> 04:28.233
can we talk to you
over here for a sec?

04:28.235 --> 04:30.402
- Thanks. I'm tired
of pretending to rake.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.738
- [rake clatters,
cat yowls]

04:32.740 --> 04:33.872
- What is it?

04:33.874 --> 04:34.806
- Congratulations.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.875
We're picking you
to be our Li'l Z.

04:36.877 --> 04:37.876
Is that like a rap name?

04:37.878 --> 04:40.779
'Cause I was thinking
Nora the Destroya.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.283
- No. As our Li'l Z,
we're gonna train you

04:44.285 --> 04:46.785
and help take your powers
to the next level.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.953
- Whoa, that'd be amazing!

04:47.955 --> 04:49.688
You can help me perfect
my laser loops,

04:49.690 --> 04:53.225
so I'll be ready to protect
my own city some day.

04:53.227 --> 04:56.261
- [lasers zapping]

04:56.263 --> 04:56.928
- MAX:
Ha. Cool.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.797
- Oh, I hope Billy's
not gonna be disappointed

04:58.799 --> 05:00.365
when he finds out
about all this.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.200
- Unh, Billy's used
to being disappointed.

05:02.202 --> 05:05.304
Just give him a cracker
and he'll be fine.

05:05.306 --> 05:05.771
See?

05:05.773 --> 05:08.707
- I should be upset that
Nora's not helping me rake,

05:08.709 --> 05:11.543
but, man,
these crackers are good.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.611
[crunching]

05:12.613 --> 05:15.781
- No wonder we're
always outta crackers.

05:15.783 --> 05:19.384
Um, Nora, why don't you
go wait inside for us.

05:19.386 --> 05:20.419
- Okay.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.255
- Billy, we need to talk.
- Cool.

05:23.257 --> 05:27.259
Just let me finish getting
rid of these leaves first.

05:27.261 --> 05:30.429
- [wind whooshing]

05:36.603 --> 05:38.370
- Did Billy just
do something cool?

05:38.372 --> 05:39.805
- I think he did.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.840
Uh, Billy, have you
ever thought about

05:41.842 --> 05:43.809
doing that with
both arms?

05:43.811 --> 05:45.544
- You mean, like this?

05:45.546 --> 05:48.714
- [wind whooshing]

05:50.584 --> 05:52.684
- So, we're going
with Billy, right?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.619
- Definitely Billy.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.489
- ¶

05:57.491 --> 05:58.590
¶ What you see ¶

05:58.592 --> 05:59.825
¶ Is not what you get ¶

05:59.827 --> 06:03.428
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

06:03.430 --> 06:04.930
¶ We fit right in ¶

06:04.932 --> 06:06.365
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

06:06.367 --> 06:07.899
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

06:07.901 --> 06:09.601
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

06:09.603 --> 06:11.503
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

06:11.505 --> 06:13.438
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

06:13.440 --> 06:14.840
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

06:14.842 --> 06:16.441
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

06:16.443 --> 06:18.343
¶ This isn't

06:18.345 --> 06:19.778
¶ It's our reality ¶

06:19.780 --> 06:20.879
¶ Just your average family ¶

06:20.881 --> 06:24.516
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

06:24.518 --> 06:28.854
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

06:31.625 --> 06:32.691
- Sorry, guys.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.826
I didn't realize how
powerful my armnadoes were.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.728
- Powerful and amazing.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.997
How would you like
to be our Li'l--

06:38.999 --> 06:39.998
- Max!

06:40.000 --> 06:42.934
Um, Billy, could you
give us a sec?

06:42.936 --> 06:45.837
- Just knock
when you're done.

06:47.007 --> 06:47.906
- Max, what are you doing?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.708
We already told Nora
she was our Li'l Z.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.910
- Billy's powers
are cooler than Nora's.

06:51.912 --> 06:52.811
If we work with him,

06:52.813 --> 06:53.979
we'll get a ton
of Z Force points.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.581
[whining] And I wanna be
on the Z Force, Phoebe!

06:56.583 --> 06:57.549
- [whining] I know.
Me, too!

06:57.551 --> 07:01.853
I guess we could, you know,
probably teach him a lot.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.855
- He could teach us, too.
- Yeah.

07:03.857 --> 07:06.591
- He's a whiz
with that bucket.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.328
- BILLY:
Swish! I think.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.067
- [knocking on bucket]

07:17.237 --> 07:19.304
- Who is it?

07:20.641 --> 07:23.275
- Billy, um...
how would you like for us

07:23.277 --> 07:25.343
to take your powers
to the next level?

07:25.345 --> 07:27.712
- Well, my bucket powers
are already great.

07:27.714 --> 07:30.582
You saw that swish
I think I made.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.883
- No, Billy,
your armnadoes.

07:31.885 --> 07:35.887
As our Li'l Z, we'll train
you to help make them more...

07:35.889 --> 07:37.622
- Armnado-y?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.324
- Sure. Why not?

07:39.326 --> 07:40.725
- Wow, with
your training,

07:40.727 --> 07:44.129
I could become the greatest
hero in the family.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.096
- Sure. Why not?

07:45.098 --> 07:48.033
- I'm in. I can't wait to
tell Nora the good news.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.000
- Whoa!
- Not so fast!

07:49.002 --> 07:50.802
There's no time for that.
Training starts now.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.304
Why don't you take
a couple of laps

07:52.306 --> 07:53.672
around the world
to warm up?

07:53.674 --> 07:55.040
- All right.
See you in a minute.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.641
- Um...uh...
you know what, actually?

07:56.643 --> 07:59.211
Just keep running
until we text you.

07:59.213 --> 08:01.780
- BILLY:
[zooming]

08:03.851 --> 08:05.817
- All right, I'm good
at these things,

08:05.819 --> 08:07.152
so, let me do
the talking.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.920
Uh, Nora, we have
something to tell you.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.323
- Look, I made a bow
with a Li'l Z on it

08:11.325 --> 08:13.692
because I'm so excited!

08:13.694 --> 08:14.226
- Awww...

08:14.228 --> 08:17.762
In that case, Max has
something to tell you.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.664
- You're so weak.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.666
Nora...
[nervous laugh]

08:21.668 --> 08:25.003
how can I
put this delicately?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.939
We don't want you
as our Li'l Z.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.275
- You don't?

08:30.277 --> 08:33.979
- Oh, look at her
sad widdle face.

08:34.815 --> 08:38.316
- Her lip's quivering,
but I'm staying strong.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.119
- [tear sizzles]

08:41.121 --> 08:44.022
- Now there's
a laser tear.

08:45.392 --> 08:48.026
- Nora, you didn't
let me finish.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.228
We don't want you
as our Li'l Z,

08:50.230 --> 08:52.264
we need you
as our Li'l Z.

08:52.266 --> 08:54.232
- Really?
- Yeah, really?

08:54.234 --> 08:57.969
- Absolutely,
and her first assignment

08:57.971 --> 09:00.205
is to walk the perimeter
of Hiddenville

09:00.207 --> 09:01.339
and make a mental map.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.141
- Why wouldn't I just
use my phone's map?

09:03.143 --> 09:07.379
Oh, because a villain
could hack my phone.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.714
- Sure. Why not?

09:10.284 --> 09:12.384
- Max, why didn't you
just tell her the truth?

09:12.386 --> 09:14.085
- You're the one
who made me talk.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.921
Lie and deny
is the Max Thunderman way.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.989
- Yeah, well, not getting
lasered in the face

09:17.991 --> 09:19.724
is the Phoebe Thunderman way.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.393
- Phoebe, by the time
she finds out,

09:21.395 --> 09:23.461
we'll already be
on the Z Force.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.729
- Hm, that's a good point.

09:24.731 --> 09:28.867
We'll have a whole team of
superheroes to fight her off.

09:32.806 --> 09:33.905
- BLOBBIN:
[fluttering tongue]

09:33.907 --> 09:36.174
- Blobbin, you've been doing
the drumroll for 30 minutes.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.276
Just show us
the product, please.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.312
- [chuckling]
Okay.

09:40.314 --> 09:41.179
From now on,

09:41.181 --> 09:43.815
when the world thinks of
Hank Thunderman's face,

09:43.817 --> 09:45.817
they'll think of...

09:51.024 --> 09:51.756
- Underwear?

09:51.758 --> 09:53.758
- [chuckling]
Not just underwear.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.293
It's ThunderWear!
[chuckling]

09:55.295 --> 09:59.831
It makes the everyday person
look and feel like a superhero.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.268
- Daddy's a ButtFace.

10:03.270 --> 10:07.272
- Blobbin, my face does not
belong on your tighty brighties.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.408
- You don't sound as excited
as I thought you'd be.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.178
- Because you put my cheeks
on people's cheeks.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.046
- But we ordered
two million of these,

10:15.048 --> 10:17.282
and operators
are standing by.

10:17.284 --> 10:17.882
[gasps]

10:17.884 --> 10:19.184
You're not gonna break
your promise, are you?

10:19.186 --> 10:22.387
- My Daddy would never
break a ThunderPromise.

10:22.389 --> 10:25.023
- Of course,
he wouldn't.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.492
- I won't break
my promise.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.427
I'll be your buttface.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.096
- Oh, thank goodness,

10:31.098 --> 10:32.931
because we're having
a ThunderWear launch party

10:32.933 --> 10:36.101
later today at Splatburger
and I need you to wear these.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.869
- Ew.

10:37.871 --> 10:38.770
"One size fits all"?

10:38.772 --> 10:41.339
- That's right. I tested
that pair myself.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.208
- Ahhhhh!

10:47.948 --> 10:50.081
- Whoa, hey.
What happened to you?

10:50.083 --> 10:52.817
- I was in the middle of
my first Li'l Z assignment,

10:52.819 --> 10:55.820
but I made a wrong
turn at the Skunk Park.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.789
- Accch! You smell terrible.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.525
- You used to be a man.
- Fair enough.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.160
- [wind whooshing]

11:02.162 --> 11:02.961
- Hey, what gives?

11:02.963 --> 11:04.262
- All right, Billy,
you're doing great.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.097
- But maybe you'll get
a little bit more wind,

11:06.099 --> 11:08.533
if you try opening your
fingers while you do it.

11:08.535 --> 11:09.234
- I don't get it.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.803
Why are they training Billy
when I'm their Li'l Z?

11:11.805 --> 11:13.972
- Okay. Armnadoes, go!

11:13.974 --> 11:15.340
- [wind whooshing]

11:15.342 --> 11:18.209
- [objects clattering,
shattering]

11:18.879 --> 11:23.048
- I can't believe how reckless
and destructive that was.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.382
- I know.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.184
It was amazing!

11:26.186 --> 11:27.819
But it'll probably
be safer,

11:27.821 --> 11:29.320
if we train him
at a different location.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.423
- Well, we could take
him to the junkyard.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.825
Everything there's
already broken.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.160
- Awesome!
[zooming]

11:35.162 --> 11:39.297
- Okay, uh, I guess
we'll meet you there.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.402
- Cool, they made
Billy a Li'l Z, too.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.872
- Oh, you sad,
smelly child.

11:47.874 --> 11:51.543
They chose Billy over you.
- What?

11:51.545 --> 11:52.877
How could they
do this to me?

11:52.879 --> 11:55.447
- They said something about
impressing the Z Force

11:55.449 --> 11:57.882
with Billy's awesome powers,

11:57.884 --> 12:01.052
and you being an overgrown
laser pointer.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.120
- They said that?

12:02.122 --> 12:04.422
- No, I made it
a lot meaner.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.425
The point is--
he's in, you're out.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.027
- We'll see about that.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.895
I'll show them
my powers are cool.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.297
- Whoa, you can't
go down there

12:12.299 --> 12:15.633
with those useless eyeballs
stinkin' up the place.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.903
You've gotta up
your game, girlfriend--

12:18.905 --> 12:21.172
and I have just the thing.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.907
- You'd really help me?

12:22.909 --> 12:24.242
- Yeah, sure.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.478
Right after
I finish the dishes.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.947
- [dishes shattering]

12:28.949 --> 12:31.950
- Okay. All done.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.188
- Oh, what's taking
Hank so long?

12:37.190 --> 12:38.590
We're gonna be late
to the launch party.

12:38.592 --> 12:42.994
- Well, he insisted on
washing your ThunderWear--

12:42.996 --> 12:45.063
twelve times.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.398
- HANK:
Coming!

12:49.136 --> 12:50.101
These Thundies feel weird.

12:50.103 --> 12:54.038
They keep storming
my castle gates.

12:54.040 --> 12:57.442
- It's diaper rash.
Been there.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.412
- Hank, ThunderWear
go on the outside--

13:01.414 --> 13:02.514
like a supersuit.

13:02.516 --> 13:04.149
That's why
the slogan says,

13:04.151 --> 13:06.417
"You'll look and feel
like a superhero."

13:06.419 --> 13:08.419
- I wouldn't feel
like a superhero.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.254
I'd feel like a weird guy

13:09.256 --> 13:11.489
wearin' his underwear
over his jeans.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.092
I only endorse
high quality products.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.461
[chuckling]
Hey, do you like pasta?

13:16.463 --> 13:20.565
Then you are gonna love
microwavable ThunderManicotti,

13:20.567 --> 13:23.968
the only meal that
fights crime and hunger.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.504
- So, it's settled--
put these on over your jeans

13:26.506 --> 13:29.007
and meet me at
Splatburger in an hour.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.509
Now where is that
invisible skateboard?

13:31.511 --> 13:34.078
It's the fifth one
I've lost today.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.114
[chuckling]
Oh, I'm so happy.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.117
The man of thunder
is wearing my unders!

13:39.119 --> 13:41.186
[chuckling]

13:41.188 --> 13:45.323
- Oh, Hank, I've never
seen Blobbin this excited.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.058
- Yeah, me, either.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.560
I'm not doin' it.

13:48.562 --> 13:49.460
- What?

13:49.462 --> 13:51.095
- I'm not gonna
embarrass myself

13:51.097 --> 13:52.564
at a restaurant
full of people.

13:52.566 --> 13:54.532
- You're not
gonna help Blobbin?

13:54.534 --> 13:57.669
- Yes, he is, Chloe,
because your Daddy promised,

13:57.671 --> 14:02.707
and a ThunderPromise
is as strong as ThunderTanium.

14:02.709 --> 14:05.243
- Unless a giggling
rich guy

14:05.245 --> 14:07.712
wants to put your face
on his underwear.

14:07.714 --> 14:11.182
Whoa!
[heavy thud]

14:11.184 --> 14:14.752
Found the invisible
skateboard.

14:17.657 --> 14:18.523
- All right, Colosso,

14:18.525 --> 14:20.725
I showered and I'm ready
for you to help me.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.328
- Ugh, the only thing
that could help you

14:23.330 --> 14:25.096
is another shower.

14:25.098 --> 14:25.763
You still stink!

14:25.765 --> 14:29.067
- You know, I've never
laser-fried a rabbit before.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.503
- Actually, I think
I'm the one who stinks.

14:33.506 --> 14:37.408
So, I got you a visor
to help up your laser game.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.744
- Are you talking about
these weird sunglasses?

14:39.746 --> 14:41.646
- Those were supposed
to help me cheat

14:41.648 --> 14:43.047
by seeing everybody's cards

14:43.049 --> 14:45.016
at the Villain League
poker tournament.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.185
- And they didn't work?
- They worked too well.

14:47.187 --> 14:50.321
My eyesight was so boosted,
that when someone

14:50.323 --> 14:52.290
lit a candle, I thought
the sun exploded.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.459
- So, if the visor made
your eyesight stronger,

14:54.461 --> 14:57.128
it should do the same
for my lasers.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.663
Colosso,
you're a genius!

14:58.665 --> 15:00.465
- Evil genius!

15:00.467 --> 15:03.268
Now aim for the target.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.506
- [laser zapping,
explosion]

15:08.508 --> 15:11.776
- Bumble Bee-oncé,
Jay-Zebra, no!

15:11.778 --> 15:15.079
- Cool. Max and Phoebe will
wish I was their Li'l Z

15:15.081 --> 15:16.281
when they see this.

15:16.283 --> 15:19.751
- [coughs] That blast
was way too big to control.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.553
Someone could
get hurt, Nora.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.088
Nora?

15:24.090 --> 15:27.125
Unh, she'll
figure it out.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.530
- All right,
this is the junkyard.

15:32.532 --> 15:33.131
Where's Billy?

15:33.133 --> 15:36.534
- [disco music starts playing]
- What's that music?

15:36.536 --> 15:38.303
- BILLY:
Guys, check it out.

15:38.305 --> 15:41.406
These mirror balls make
me just wanna dance.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.641
- [disco music]

15:43.643 --> 15:47.578
¶

15:47.580 --> 15:52.483
- Okay, time to focus,
disco dork.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.953
- Guys, should we be
worried about that sign?

15:54.955 --> 15:56.521
- BILLY: "Beware
of guard cat"?

15:56.523 --> 15:58.690
- There's no such thing
as guard cats.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.358
If there were,
we'd just shoo it away.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.993
Like this, git, kit, kit!
[laughing]

16:01.995 --> 16:03.361
Cats hate it,
so do sisters.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.863
Git, kit, kit!
- PHOEBE: [hissing]

16:05.865 --> 16:07.432
- See?

16:07.434 --> 16:08.733
- Man, my arms are sore.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.868
Mind if I take a break, first?
- Yeah, sure.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.972
We need you rested so we can
get those extra points.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.908
Okay, break's over.

16:16.910 --> 16:21.346
Time to show the Z Force
how we upped your powers.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.515
And we're rolling.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.585
- So, Billy, I bet if you
superspeed spin in a circle,

16:27.587 --> 16:30.288
you could create your
biggest cyclone yet.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.991
- Or puke from
being too dizzy.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.793
Oh, I'll edit that out.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.795
Just trying spinning,
Li'l Z.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.598
- Okay, I'll give
it a try.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.967
- [wind whooshing]

16:46.339 --> 16:48.673
- [garbage cans clatter]

16:48.675 --> 16:50.742
- Wow, that looked
amazing,

16:50.744 --> 16:52.810
but I think
you hit a skunk.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.045
Something stinks.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.981
- That would be me.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.750
You guys sent me on
a fake assignment,

16:58.752 --> 17:01.419
and I ended up
in Skunk Park.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.489
- Made that wrong
turn, huh?

17:04.491 --> 17:08.359
- You smell
and I'm dizzy.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.361
[small thud]

17:10.363 --> 17:11.896
- MAX: Nora.
[nervous laugh]

17:11.898 --> 17:14.032
I can explain this.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.767
Phoebe, you're up.
- What?

17:15.769 --> 17:17.368
- I know you guys
picked Billy

17:17.370 --> 17:19.370
because you think his
powers are cooler.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.072
But my powers
are cool, too.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.641
- Colosso's visor.
You shouldn't be wearing that.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.510
It's wonky.
- You're wonky!

17:25.512 --> 17:26.611
Now watch this.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.112
- [laser zapping]
- Uh-oh!

17:28.114 --> 17:31.382
- [dramatic music]

17:31.384 --> 17:33.418
- Cut it down, Nora!
- I'm trying!

17:33.420 --> 17:36.487
- MAX & PHOEBE: [scream]
- [heavy thud]

17:39.392 --> 17:40.525
- Are you guys okay?

17:40.527 --> 17:41.826
- Yes, is what
I would say,

17:41.828 --> 17:44.929
if I weren't being trapped
by a giant pizza.

17:44.931 --> 17:45.630
- I'm sorry.

17:45.632 --> 17:49.033
I just wanted to show you guys
that I could be a great Li'l Z.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.002
- No need to
apologize. Tiger.

17:51.004 --> 17:53.371
- That's a weird
nickname for her.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.405
I'd go with Skunk Girl.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.542
- No, no, no, tiger!
- [tiger snarling]

18:00.447 --> 18:03.648
That cat sign
was very misleading.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.418
- MAX: Don't worry,
guys, I got this.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.453
Git, kit, kit!

18:08.455 --> 18:09.754
- [tiger snarling]

18:09.756 --> 18:13.524
- You're making him
and me much angrier.

18:14.828 --> 18:15.760
- [chuckling]

18:15.762 --> 18:18.096
I knew we had another
box of ThunderManicotti.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.099
Ew, expired three
years ago.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.533
I'll take my chances.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.701
Ow! Ow! Ow!

18:23.703 --> 18:24.869
- Ow! Not again!

18:24.871 --> 18:29.440
- Ah, it's like I'm standing
on a family of stingrays.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.142
- Chloe!
- [whooshing]

18:31.144 --> 18:33.544
Hey, guys, what's up?

18:33.546 --> 18:36.114
- Why are your
toys everywhere?

18:36.116 --> 18:38.182
- You promised you'd
pick up your toys.

18:38.184 --> 18:42.086
- So? You didn't keep
your promise to Blobbin.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.822
Later!
[whooshing]

18:44.824 --> 18:47.125
- Hank, this is
what you get

18:47.127 --> 18:49.994
for breaking your ThunderPromise
in front of Chloe.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.830
I think you know
what you need to do.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.800
- Eat this expired
manicotti?

18:57.770 --> 19:00.605
- [tongue fluttering]

19:00.607 --> 19:01.506
[laughing]

19:01.508 --> 19:03.207
Sorry about
the two hour drumroll.

19:03.209 --> 19:07.512
But I don't think our special
guest is gonna show.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.615
- Think again!
- BLOBBIN: [gasps]

19:10.617 --> 19:11.249
Where were you?

19:11.251 --> 19:13.551
I forgive you.
Strut your stuff.

19:13.553 --> 19:17.889
And now, former superhero--
ThunderMan!

19:17.891 --> 19:19.924
- CROWD:
[cheering, applauding]

19:19.926 --> 19:23.661
- Wow, look at him rocking
those ThunderWear.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.664
So fierce. So comfortable.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.834
- The breathable cotton allows
me to stay super cool

19:29.836 --> 19:32.470
when I'm dropping
the kids off at school,

19:32.472 --> 19:37.041
or showing up at Splatburger
to keep my promises.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.046
- And with our patented
stretch 'n snap technology,

19:42.048 --> 19:45.550
say goodbye to saggy,
droopin' drawers.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.119
- Goodbye, saggy,
droopin' drawers.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.654
- [elastic snaps]

19:49.656 --> 19:50.788
- Isn't he amazing?

19:50.790 --> 19:52.190
Just like ThunderWear!

19:52.192 --> 19:55.126
Now who wants a pair?

19:56.062 --> 19:59.096
Buy one, get one free.
[nervous laugh]

19:59.098 --> 20:02.166
Buy none,
get two free?

20:02.168 --> 20:04.936
At least give
it a try.

20:04.938 --> 20:06.904
Ohhh...

20:06.906 --> 20:08.606
- Sorry, Blobbin.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.741
They can't all
be winners.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.143
Or make sense.

20:12.145 --> 20:13.744
- It's not the end
of the world.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.247
At least I didn't put
my face on it.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.248
[chuckling]

20:17.250 --> 20:19.817
Catch ya later,
ThunderFam!

20:19.819 --> 20:21.719
- I am proud
of you, honey.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.621
- Oh, well, I don't
care how silly I look,

20:23.623 --> 20:26.123
as long as our little girl
learns her lesson.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.893
- Goodbye, saggy,
droopin' drawers!

20:28.895 --> 20:30.294
- [elastic snaps]

20:30.296 --> 20:34.765
- Well, at least
she learned a lesson.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.236
- [tiger snarling]

20:38.238 --> 20:39.237
- Oh, no!
This is my fault.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.606
Now you and Max
are gonna be eaten.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.108
- Why didn't you
just pick up a sub?

20:44.110 --> 20:46.811
- Wait, our Li'l Z
can fix this.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.913
- Which one,
Stinky or Twirly?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.781
- We're standing
right here.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.984
- You tell 'em, Twirly.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.253
- Nora, the visor
boosted your lasers,

20:55.255 --> 20:57.321
but maybe you could
boost them on your own.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.790
- Yeah, try closing your
eyes to build up the energy.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.860
- Oh, so now I'm your Li' Z.
- Just try it!

21:07.267 --> 21:10.268
- [lasers zapping]
- [pizza sizzling]

21:10.270 --> 21:12.870
- It worked!
- Yeah!

21:12.872 --> 21:14.739
- [tiger snarling]

21:14.741 --> 21:17.308
- And the tiger's
not a fan.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.776
- I'm on it.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.145
- [wind whooshing]

21:21.147 --> 21:24.315
- [tiger snarling]

21:24.317 --> 21:28.152
- [triumphant music]

21:28.154 --> 21:29.754
- Way to go, guys.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.589
- Don't you mean,
way to go us?

21:31.591 --> 21:33.291
We mentored them into
saving our lives.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.893
- Nora, we're so sorry
for not being honest.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.696
We should have never put
our assignment ahead of you.

21:38.698 --> 21:39.297
- I forgive you.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.065
Besides, I already
rubbed my skunk smell

21:41.067 --> 21:43.868
all over your
clothes at home.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.202
- Where's my apology?

21:45.204 --> 21:47.905
- For what?
Making you awesome?

21:47.907 --> 21:51.008
We're sorry for
pushing you so hard.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.811
It's too bad you can't
both be our Li'l Z's.

21:53.813 --> 21:57.081
- Wait, Max,
there are two of us.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.916
Maybe we can
submit two Li'l Z's.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.351
- Really?
- That'd be great.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.186
- Let's go.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.388
Wait, we forgot
the video.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.389
- [tiger snarling]

22:05.391 --> 22:07.658
- We'll make a new video.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.126
Run!

22:12.165 --> 22:24.375
- ¶
