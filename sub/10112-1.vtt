[ Man ] One time my cousin Walter
got this cat stuck in his ass.

00:42.558 --> 00:47.638
True story. He bought it
at our local mall, so the whole
fiasco wound up on the news.

00:47.678 --> 00:51.437
It was embarrassing for my relatives and
all, but the next week, he did it again.

00:51.477 --> 00:55.317
Different cat, same results, complete
with another trip to the emergency room.

00:55.357 --> 00:58.836
So, I run into him a week later in
the mall and he's buying another cat.

00:58.876 --> 01:01.476
And I says to him,
“Jesus, Walt! What are you doing?

01:01.516 --> 01:05.596
You know you're gonna get this cat
stuck in your ass too.
Why don't you knock it off?”

01:05.636 --> 01:09.996

how the hell else am I supposed
to get the gerbil out?”

13:44.196 --> 13:48.816
–Ask one of the workers.
–No. There's a soul
who might know what's up.

13:57.755 --> 13:59.634
Willam?

14:00.874 --> 14:03.515
–Willam!
–[ Gasps ] Booby-trapped!

14:03.554 --> 14:06.593
Brodie, man, what's goin' on?
You work here now?

14:06.633 --> 14:09.433
–No, man, just hanging with T.S.
–Oh, T.S.

14:09.514 --> 14:13.513
–[T.S.] Willam, what exactly are you doing?
–Looking for the hidden picture.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.633
If you stare long enough,
you're supposed to see some hidden…

14:16.673 --> 14:18.752
three-dimensional
picture.

14:18.872 --> 14:22.766
–Oh, yeah, look, it's a sailboat.
–You saw it too? Damn it!

14:22.872 --> 14:25.952
–What?
–I've been staring at
this thing for a week now…

14:25.992 --> 14:29.391
and I can't see a goddamn thing!
–You gotta relax your eyes.

14:29.431 --> 14:33.751
Everyone sees this thing
except me. Today's my day.
I brought a lunch and a soda.

14:33.791 --> 14:37.591
I'm not gonna leave until I see this
sailboat everyone keeps talking about.

14:37.631 --> 14:39.991
So, Willam, would you
happen to know…

14:40.031 --> 14:42.590
what this stage business
is all about?

14:42.710 --> 14:46.550
It's not a stage! I'm gonna see it
if I have to go blind trying.

14:46.590 --> 14:48.789
No, man, this stage
over here.

14:48.909 --> 14:52.949
Oh, that thing. Some game show in the
mall today. I think it's gonna be on TV.

14:52.989 --> 14:55.563
It's called Truth or Date
or something.

14:55.629 --> 14:58.348
–Oh, my God! That's
Brandi's father's game show.
–What is it?

14:58.388 --> 15:01.468
It's this cheesy Dating Game
rip-off thing. It's supposed
to be for college kids.

15:01.508 --> 15:04.347
Trying to capture the 90s youth market
with a staple of 70s television.

15:04.387 --> 15:08.347
Why can't they bring back or remake
good shows like B.J And The Bear?

15:08.387 --> 15:11.227
Now, there's a concept I can't get
enough of; a man and his monkey.

15:11.267 --> 15:15.107
Would you guys shut up?
You're breaking my concentration.

15:15.226 --> 15:20.306
–Sorry, Willam.
–Now I have to start all over again.

15:20.346 --> 15:24.706
–Good luck with that thing.
–Yeah, man, remember, relax your eyes.

15:29.665 --> 15:32.665
–Wow, a sailboat.
–Shut up!

15:32.785 --> 15:35.825
[ Sighs ]
Could this week get any worse?

15:35.864 --> 15:40.464
–Now she's gonna be auctioned
off on live TV from a mall.
–Not a mall. The mall.

15:40.504 --> 15:44.703
Show some respect.
But it doesn't have to go down
like that if we trash the thing.

15:44.743 --> 15:48.543
There's a unique way of getting
back in her good graces—
ruining her father's show.

15:48.583 --> 15:51.302
I can get somebody
to do it for us.

15:51.343 --> 15:54.143
We'll be blame-free and Brandi
won't be able to do the show.

15:54.183 --> 15:57.417
–Who is this imaginary hatchet man?
–Hatchet men.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.179
Knock it off.
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

16:21.219 --> 16:25.459
–Hey, Jay!
–Brodie, man. Noochie-noochies.

16:25.499 --> 16:28.899
And look at this shit.
The mad, fat chick killer.

16:29.019 --> 16:32.178
Can't believe how fast word travels
in this town. What's he doing?

16:32.218 --> 16:36.938
Shithead here watched Empire
and Jedi and he's been trying
to do the Jedi mind trick.

16:36.978 --> 16:40.378
Crazy fuck thinks he'll levitate shit
with his thoughts. Knock it off!

16:40.418 --> 16:42.857
–The force is strong with this one.
–Don't encourage him.

16:42.897 --> 16:45.737
I was just telling T.S.
we gotta find Jay and Silent Bob.

16:45.777 --> 16:49.177
If there's any one that can
help us out, it's the two guys
who have less to do than us.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.457
What is this shit?
Everyone's looking for us today.

16:51.497 --> 16:54.776
We're duckin' Tricia 'cause she wants to
talk to Obi-Wan about her video setup.

16:54.816 --> 16:56.976
–Why him?
–Silent Bob's an electrical genius.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.176
He won the science fair
in eighth grade…

16:59.216 --> 17:01.255
by turning his mom's vibrator into a
CD player using chicken wire and shit.

17:01.295 --> 17:06.295
Motherfucker's like MacGyver—
No, motherfucker's better
than MacGyver! Knock it off!

17:06.335 --> 17:09.575
–It's that kind of smarts
we need, right, Mopey?
–Leave me out of this.

17:09.615 --> 17:14.534
So we need you to embark
on a little sabotage mission
on behalf of T.S.'s love life.

17:14.574 --> 17:17.214
[ Mumbling ]

17:17.292 --> 17:19.493
Stage dive.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.414
You know about this game show
they got goin' on here?

17:23.454 --> 17:26.333
We need you guys to somehow
ensure that it doesn't happen.

17:26.373 --> 17:28.772
–Is that it?
We were gonna do that anyway.
–Why?

17:28.812 --> 17:32.212
What else we gonna do? Silent Bob
stole the schematic of the stage…

17:32.252 --> 17:36.172
from some foolish carpenter
and found a weakness, just like
the fuckin' Death Star.

17:36.212 --> 17:40.972
He figures you pull this crossbeam out—
bickety-bam! The whole stage comes down.

17:41.012 --> 17:44.851
We were thinkin' about somethin'
simple, but if you wanna destroy
the stage, we're all for that.

17:44.891 --> 17:47.597
–Only problem is LaFours.
–Who's LaFours?

17:47.611 --> 17:50.050
You don't know LaFours?
They don't know who LaFours is.

17:50.090 --> 17:53.570
LaFours is only the most
feared security guard in the business.

17:53.610 --> 17:56.889
Four hundred and
sixty collars, all convicted.
I hear he's even got two kills.

17:56.929 --> 18:02.289
Holy shit. I never thought
I'd see the day when two such
reputable mischief makers…

18:02.329 --> 18:05.969
douse their drawers at the sight
of a mall security guard.

18:06.009 --> 18:08.929
Shit, bitch, we're gonna bust
that stage like a high school kegger.

18:08.969 --> 18:11.208
We're just gonna outwit
LaFours, X-Men style.

18:11.248 --> 18:13.928
–Should I call you “Logan,” Weapon X?
–No, “Wolverine”!

18:13.968 --> 18:16.528
Snicktey-snicktey-snoime!

18:16.567 --> 18:20.047
He's imitating Wolverine's berserker
attack with his adamantium claws.

18:20.087 --> 18:24.327
–I never would've guessed.
–You have your mission.
Go forth, wreak havoc.

18:24.367 --> 18:29.607
Bye, baby kitties.
Damn, Silent Bob, show some heart.

18:29.726 --> 18:32.894
–[ Whistling ]
–That's better. We're on the job.

18:34.126 --> 18:36.326
Thanks.

18:36.405 --> 18:39.325
I have to admit I'm shocked
you didn't try to dissuade them.

18:39.365 --> 18:42.685
[ Chuckles ] I would if I thought
they could pull it off.

18:42.725 --> 18:45.605
Oh, ye of little faith.
Want a cookie?

18:48.524 --> 18:50.564
What's he doing?

18:50.684 --> 18:54.363
If you stare at this poster for a
few seconds, a hidden picture appears.

18:54.403 --> 18:56.723
[ Together ]
Can we do it, please, please?

18:56.763 --> 18:59.963
[ Mother ] All right, go ahead.
But hurry, the Easter Bunny's waiting.

19:00.003 --> 19:02.123
Wow, it's a schooner.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.522
[ Chuckles ]
You dumb bastard.

19:05.642 --> 19:07.842
It's not a schooner;
it's a sailboat.

19:07.882 --> 19:10.562
A schooner is a sailboat,
stupid-head.

19:12.002 --> 19:15.962
You know what?
There is no Easter Bunny!

19:16.081 --> 19:19.641
Over there,
that's just a guy in a suit!

19:21.841 --> 19:24.680
–But they're engaged.
–Doesn't matter, it can't happen.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.120
–Why not? It's bound to come up.
–It's impossible.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.040
Lois could never have
Superman's baby.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.800
Do you think her fallopian tubes
could handle his sperm?

19:31.840 --> 19:35.119
I guarantee he blows a load
like a shotgun right through her back.

19:35.159 --> 19:38.159
What about her womb? You think
it's strong enough to carry his child?

19:38.199 --> 19:40.679
–Sure. Why not?
–He's an alien, for Christ's sake!

19:40.719 --> 19:44.518
His Kryptonian biological makeup
is enhanced by Earth's yellow sun.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.398
If Lois gets a tan, the kid
could kick right through her stomach.

19:47.438 --> 19:50.998
Only someone like Wonder Woman has a
strong-enough uterus to carry his kid.

19:51.038 --> 19:55.237
Only way he could bang regular
chicks is with a Kryptonite
condom, but that would kill him.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.117
How is it I go from the verge
of hot Floridian sex with Brandi…

19:58.157 --> 20:00.997
to Man of Steel coital debates
with you in the food court?

20:01.037 --> 20:04.156
–Cookie stand is
not part of the food court.
–Of course it is.

20:04.196 --> 20:06.916
The food court is downstairs;
the cookie stand is upstairs.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.996
We're not talking
quantum physics here.

20:09.036 --> 20:11.315
The cookie stand counts as an eatery;
the eatery's part of the food court.

20:11.355 --> 20:15.835
Bullshit. Eateries that operate
within the square downstairs
qualify as food court.

20:15.875 --> 20:18.435
Anything outside
of said designated square…

20:18.475 --> 20:21.835
is considered an autonomous unit
for mid-mall snacking.

20:21.875 --> 20:27.394
If you're gonna wax intellectual
about the subject— Holy shit!

20:27.434 --> 20:29.348
–Wait here.
–Where you going?

20:30.994 --> 20:33.593
[ Sighs ]
Chercher la femme.

20:38.512 --> 20:42.432
–That would look terrible on you.
–Didn't I dump your ass this morning?

20:42.472 --> 20:45.552
Look, I know you've had some time to
think about the mistake you've made…

20:45.592 --> 20:48.112
and I just wanna let you know
you don't have to apologize.

20:48.152 --> 20:51.511
–I'm sure you were just PMS-ing.
–What kills me about you…

20:51.551 --> 20:55.071
is your inability to function
on the same plane of existence
as the rest of us.

20:55.111 --> 20:56.991
Piss off.

20:57.030 --> 21:01.191
Okay, okay, I see you wanna continue
with this charade of ending our union.

21:01.231 --> 21:05.510
Fine, I'll play along.
If we're divorced, we're gonna
have to divide our possessions.

21:05.550 --> 21:07.510
What the hell
are you talking about?

21:07.550 --> 21:11.549
You have my Punisher War Journal
number six, my copy of Fletch,
and the remote to my TV.

21:11.589 --> 21:15.349
It's gonna be hard to give this stuff up
because of its sentimental attachment—

21:15.389 --> 21:21.263
Sentimental attachment?
If I have that crap, it's 'cause
you brought it over and left it.

21:21.388 --> 21:25.668
–Let's talk about a schedule
for visitation rights?
–For what?

21:25.707 --> 21:30.187
For the mall. You can have the odd days,
I'll take the even days and weekends.

21:30.227 --> 21:34.707
–When there's any special
function like a sidewalk sale—
–Brodie. Brodie!

21:34.747 --> 21:38.147
I have always taken you
with a grain of salt.

21:38.267 --> 21:43.306
Your birthday, when you asked me
to do a striptease to the theme
from Mighty Mouse, I said okay.

21:43.346 --> 21:48.985
On prom night, you asked me
to sleep under the bed in case
your mother burst in, I did.

21:49.025 --> 21:52.545
And even when we were
at my grandmother's funeral
and you told my relatives…

21:52.585 --> 21:56.345
that you could see her nipples through
her burial dress, I let it slide.

21:56.385 --> 22:00.024
But if you think I'm gonna suffer
any more of your shit with a smile…

22:00.064 --> 22:03.364
you're in for some serious
fucking disappointment.

22:06.264 --> 22:08.183
What?

22:08.183 --> 22:12.703
[ Jay ] Phase one. You take a run at
LaFours with a sock full of quarters.

22:12.743 --> 22:16.222
I'd do it, but I pulled my back out
humping your mom last night.

22:16.262 --> 22:19.262
You clock him on his headpiece
and knock his ass out cold.

22:19.302 --> 22:22.981
That's when phase two kicks in. I attack
the structure, Wolvie-berserk style…

22:23.021 --> 22:26.701
knock out the fuckin' pin, and
bickety-bam— the motherfucker's rubble.

22:26.741 --> 22:28.622

23:29.135 --> 23:33.335
–I hope his pants get caught
and a bloodbath ensues.
–What is with you today?

23:33.375 --> 23:36.894
I don't wish the kid harm,
but his mother should suffer
that horrific ordeal…

23:36.934 --> 23:41.014
so she'll learn how
to manage her child!
–Sort of a harsh lesson.

23:41.054 --> 23:43.093
Man, there's not
a year goes by…

23:43.133 --> 23:46.933
that I don't read about some escalator
accident involving some bastard kid…

23:46.973 --> 23:50.652
that could've been easily avoided had
some parent— I don't care which one—

23:50.692 --> 23:56.012
but some parent conditioned him
to fear and respect that escalator!

Updating my calendar and waiting
for Jay and Silent Bob.

24:14.930 --> 24:18.209

–So, what do you say?
You wanna nail T.S or what?
–Jesus, Brodie!

Calm down. Tricia's compiling
data for this book she's writing
about the sex drive of men…

24:42.207 --> 24:45.007
ages 14 to 30.

24:45.087 --> 24:49.207
If I remember correctly, it's
titled Bore-gasm: Study of the
Nineties' Male Sexual Prowess.

Ready to get sick?
Tell him about the advance you got.

24:52.126 --> 24:55.766

on a treatment and a sample chapter.

author to tackle the subject.

24:59.486 --> 25:02.325
Tricia here sleeps
with a bunch of guys as research.

–And if that's not enough,
she videotapes all of them.
–What?

25:05.525 --> 25:07.964
I get everybody's consent
before we do it.

25:08.004 --> 25:11.106
Most guys get off on it.
Men are easily amused.

25:11.164 --> 25:13.604
Wh-What are you writing

25:13.644 --> 25:16.483
–I was coding last night's research.
–She means sex.

25:16.523 --> 25:19.523
I know what she meant!
What kind of codes?

25:19.643 --> 25:23.483
Here, look. The smiley face
is for when I go down on a guy.

25:23.523 --> 25:26.602
The smiley face with lashes
is for when the guy goes down on me.

25:26.642 --> 25:31.282
The circle is when we have sex.
The circle with the “X”
is for when I have an orgasm.

25:31.322 --> 25:34.562
The little house is when we do it
inside, and the grass is for outside.

25:34.602 --> 25:37.081

How old was last night's subject,
if you don't mind?

25:39.681 --> 25:42.561
Twenty-five. It was the guy who runs
that store Fashionable Male.

–Holy shit! You slept with that asshole?
–I needed a 25-year-old.

25:47.360 --> 25:51.560
–And he has quite a distaste
for you, I might add.
–He mentioned me during sex?

25:51.600 --> 25:55.680
Afterwards. He says he wants
to kick your ass. I'd steer
clear of him if I were you.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.599
–Tell me you videotaped him saying that.
–No.

25:57.639 --> 26:01.999
I shut the camera off after
the sex. You should've heard
the stuff he wanted to do.

Do your parents know about this?

26:04.679 --> 26:06.593
–Of course.

–It's not like she's in
an exclusive club.
–What are you talking about?

–Sean Hartle's giving
everyone the inside scoop.
–What's he saying?

We tie you to the roof

a spitfire passing over LaFours.

28:00.666 --> 28:03.226
You then swing up to the stage
and knock out the pin.

28:03.266 --> 28:06.986
When that's gone, the stage is trashed,
and we go smoke a bowl. You got it?

Now, get your fat ass up there.
And, dude, don't forget
your helmet. Snoogins.

–Her father.

are you anyway?

29:33.256 --> 29:36.257
I'm talkin' comics, and you bring up
chicks and romance.

29:36.297 --> 29:41.055
While we're on the subject, why get
married now anyway? You're in college.

29:41.095 --> 29:43.936
I was just gonna propose. The wedding
wouldn't be 'til after we graduate.

29:43.976 --> 29:49.655
Waste of time. My grandmother
always said, “Why buy the cow
when you get the sex for free?”

–She did?
–All the time.

You know how when someone
lays with their back to you…

and you lay behind them really close
and you throw one arm over them?

39:52.591 --> 39:55.631
–It's called spooning.
–Yeah, but you gotta put
the other arm somewhere.

39:55.671 --> 39:58.471
You can either lay on it
or shove it between your bodies.

39:58.511 --> 40:01.071
The only other option is
to stretch it above your head.

40:01.111 --> 40:04.870
But sometimes my arm pops out
of socket when I'm sleeping like that.

40:04.910 --> 40:10.150

for someplace to keep my arm
while still laying close to her.

I like that sort of thing. Tell me,
do you have a girlfriend, Brodie?

01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:26.810
Had one.
We just broke up.

01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:30.289

orange rock like the rest of his body?

[ Chuckles ] It's a superhero's secret.
Tell me, Brodie.

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:36.688
–Why did you and
your girlfriend break up?
–She was a pain in the ass.

01:02:36.728 --> 01:02:39.368
She wanted me to be
this typical boyfriend guy.

01:02:39.408 --> 01:02:43.728
–Said I was too into my own world
of comics and all.
–Yeah, I can relate.

01:02:43.768 --> 01:02:46.687
There was a time when
it was all about comics for me.

01:02:46.727 --> 01:02:50.527
I had a girl,
probably the same as yours.

01:02:50.647 --> 01:02:54.607
She always complained that I spent
too much time with my own comics.

01:02:54.647 --> 01:02:56.566
And, eventually,
we broke up.

01:02:56.686 --> 01:02:59.686

Here you are now, a legend in the field.

01:02:59.726 --> 01:03:03.765
–Probably had a slew of women
since her. Am I right?
–Oh, lots of women.

01:03:03.805 --> 01:03:07.685
Jagger and me, we had a running contest
to see who had the most.

01:03:07.725 --> 01:03:10.525

last time I looked, I was way ahead.

01:03:10.565 --> 01:03:14.445
–Damn, that's hot!
–But I never forgot that girl.

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:19.044
–Did you ever get back together?
–One day, I found out she got married.

01:03:19.084 --> 01:03:22.124
I had blown it.
I had, uh… missed my window.

01:03:22.203 --> 01:03:24.723
No way.
Well, what'd you do?

01:03:24.803 --> 01:03:27.443
I went on with my life.

01:03:27.523 --> 01:03:31.043
I created some special
new superheroes.

01:03:31.123 --> 01:03:34.802
They were characters that reflected
my own heartbreak and my own regrets.

01:03:34.842 --> 01:03:38.522
–How so?
–Doctor Doom wears body armor…

01:03:38.641 --> 01:03:42.481
to conceal his own mangled form, right?
–Yeah.

01:03:42.522 --> 01:03:45.521
Okay. That was me
beneath the armor.

01:03:45.642 --> 01:03:50.361
The Hulk— a normal guy one minute,
a rage of emotions the next.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.600
Just like me when I thought
about what I'd given up.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.400
So you created each character as a way
to deal with your one big regret.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.599
Yeah. The girl
that got away.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.959

a favor, Brodie.

out and starts beating it right there.

01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:14.100
♫ You're all that I've wanted
of a girl ♫

01:26:15.779 --> 01:26:19.339
♫ You're all that I need
in the world ♫

01:26:19.459 --> 01:26:21.659
♫ I'm your child
Make me blush ♫

01:26:21.699 --> 01:26:25.898
♫ Drive me wild, Susanne
Ooo-ooo ♫

01:26:25.939 --> 01:26:28.315
–♫ You're all that I wanted ♫
–Yeah?

01:26:29.898 --> 01:26:35.218
♫ Even Izzy, Slash
and Axl Rose ♫

01:26:35.337 --> 01:26:40.537
♫ When I call
You put 'em all on hold ♫

01:26:40.577 --> 01:26:45.536
♫ And say to me
that you'd do anything ♫

01:26:45.536 --> 01:26:47.696
♫ And all I can do is say ♫

01:26:47.736 --> 01:26:53.616
–♫ That I haven't much
I can give you in return ♫
–♫ In return ♫

01:26:53.656 --> 01:26:59.415
–♫ Only my heart
and a promise not to turn ♫
–♫ Never turn ♫

01:26:59.495 --> 01:27:04.694
♫ I'll stick to you
every day and every night ♫

01:27:04.735 --> 01:27:06.494
–♫ Susanne ♫
–♫ Susanne ♫

01:27:06.494 --> 01:27:09.094
♫ I'm your man ♫

01:27:26.132 --> 01:27:28.732
♫ Susanne ♫

01:27:28.811 --> 01:27:33.211
♫ You're all that I wanted
of a girl ♫

01:27:33.252 --> 01:27:38.011
–♫ Oh, yeah ♫
–♫ You're all that I need
in the world ♫

01:27:38.051 --> 01:27:40.531
♫ I'm your child
Make me blush ♫

01:27:40.650 --> 01:27:44.770
♫ Drive me wild, Susanne
Whoo-ooo ♫

01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:47.929
♫ You're all that I wanted ♫

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.850
♫ Of a girl ♫

01:27:51.209 --> 01:27:54.249
♫ Yeah ♫♫

01:27:57.649 --> 01:28:11.927
♫♫

01:28:13.048 --> 01:28:15.607
♫ In the company of morons ♫

01:28:15.647 --> 01:28:19.047
♫ I swear they're
unstoppable ♫

01:28:19.087 --> 01:28:22.167
♫ You can't push
They're pushin' back ♫

01:28:22.206 --> 01:28:25.726
♫ Watchin' the shoppers
race this track ♫

01:28:25.766 --> 01:28:29.166
♫ And they got places to go
so fast ♫

01:28:29.206 --> 01:28:32.365
♫ First connect
and then they pass ♫

01:28:32.445 --> 01:28:34.725
♫ Never need to get up ♫

01:28:34.805 --> 01:28:38.804
♫ Just sit and watch
and laugh and dream ♫

01:28:38.924 --> 01:28:42.004
♫ Don't walk, walk
walk too fast ♫

01:28:42.084 --> 01:28:45.404
♫ Like a trap
you trap it all in your bags ♫

01:28:45.523 --> 01:28:50.603
♫ Damaged goods
and no, no receipt ♫

01:28:50.643 --> 01:28:52.683
♫ No receipt ♫

01:28:58.442 --> 01:29:01.562
♫ Lots of books
and credit slips ♫

01:29:01.682 --> 01:29:04.722
♫ Day-Glo patterns
and old man trips ♫

01:29:04.842 --> 01:29:07.721
♫ Sight of fall
and inconvenience ♫

01:29:07.761 --> 01:29:10.481
♫ Patience runs out of stock ♫

01:29:10.481 --> 01:29:16.280
♫ Get time to oneself
to make it right ♫

01:29:16.401 --> 01:29:17.760
