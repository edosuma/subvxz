00:07.530 --> 00:10.556
Gentlemen, behold...

00:10.633 --> 00:13.124
... my Time-Space Contin...

00:17.506 --> 00:18.598
What?

00:22.077 --> 00:23.374
Dr. Weird?

00:28.784 --> 00:30.752
See you later. Have a good weekend.

01:16.332 --> 01:20.792
Houston, we have successfully landed
on the grass planet. Hurray!

01:20.870 --> 01:24.966
Roger that, Vanessa. We have come to
sign a historic peace agreement...

01:25.040 --> 01:27.873
... with the grass people, the Grassanoids.

01:28.577 --> 01:30.841
Houston, a ship approaches.

01:30.913 --> 01:34.280
Maybe it's the senators
of the Grassanoid Confederation...

01:34.350 --> 01:35.783
... coming to reckon us.

01:35.851 --> 01:38.911
- What the hell?
- Hey you better tell your astronauts...

01:38.988 --> 01:41.650
... To watch where their ship next time...

01:41.724 --> 01:45.421
... because they might get overun
 by the alien lifeform.

01:45.594 --> 01:48.028
Well, there are no ships.
They use rocket boots.

01:48.097 --> 01:50.622
- They don't use nothing now, do they?
- You shut up.

01:50.699 --> 01:54.897
I am gonna have a moment of silence
for our brave astronauts.

01:54.970 --> 01:57.234
You are gonna hit the force
field there 'cause...

01:57.235 --> 01:59.498
... because here on motoropolis,
you're next.

01:59.575 --> 02:02.510
Houston, it's Captain Meatwad!
Abort mission.

02:02.878 --> 02:06.575
<i>And then he shouted that my
astronauts were living together in sin...</i>

02:06.649 --> 02:08.741
<i>... and they deserved to be mulched.</i>

02:08.817 --> 02:11.945
Then he just joking and freaking mowing...

02:12.021 --> 02:14.319
It's all right, Meatwad. We are gonna
get you a new doll.

02:14.390 --> 02:16.915
But I am getting The Jiggle Billy!
That is what I want.

02:16.992 --> 02:18.721
It comes with a musket,
and a moonshine and a...

02:18.794 --> 02:21.627
...a  night vision
goggles and a bare feet.

02:21.697 --> 02:22.721
Damn.

02:22.798 --> 02:27.394
Say, how about this doll, huh? I bet
 he is fun and he is only $ 3.99.

02:27.503 --> 02:31.132
The Happy Time Harry? I dont know.
Does he come with a musket?

02:31.206 --> 02:32.867
Because that could be a deal breaker.

02:32.942 --> 02:35.410
No, but he's got  red
dance glitter shoes...

02:35.477 --> 02:37.377
... and I know how much you like to dance.

02:37.446 --> 02:40.540
I dont know. He looks
real tired, and  bald.

02:40.616 --> 02:42.880
Look, this is the one
we are gonna get, okay?

02:42.952 --> 02:45.512
Hey, I'm Happy-Time Harry.
Do you have a problem with that?

02:45.587 --> 02:47.248
- Because if you do, we will go right now.
- Easy.

02:47.323 --> 02:49.791
I just figured we do some
dancing or something.

02:49.858 --> 02:53.851
No. I don't do that. I lynched my back
lifting boxes a few years ago.

02:53.929 --> 02:56.921
My old lady kicked me out because
her sister was coming on to me.

02:56.999 --> 03:00.230
- Was she attractive?
- You know, I don't know.

03:00.302 --> 03:02.293
I was passed out, so...

03:02.371 --> 03:04.771
- That's a sad story.
- Yeah.

03:09.311 --> 03:12.508
So, I am looking in that
box and I am noticing...

03:12.581 --> 03:17.018
... that you you ain't got no missile
launchers, sniper rifles, nothing.

03:17.086 --> 03:21.682
No, I don't have firearms.
I just got these. Action bills.

03:22.124 --> 03:23.557
They sound like fun.

03:23.625 --> 03:26.594
Let's go swimming. You know,
that might cheer you up.

03:26.662 --> 03:29.563
Aw yeah. Swimming sounds
 like a real fun idea.

03:29.631 --> 03:32.395
Why don't you go swimming?
I gotta take a nap, alright?

03:32.468 --> 03:35.198
Get me up at midnight
'cause I got to go to work.

03:35.270 --> 03:38.000
Hey, Meatwad.
How is that old Happy Time Harry?

03:38.240 --> 03:41.300
- Pipe down!
- Quiet, Frylock, he's still sleeping.

03:41.377 --> 03:43.743
Meatwad, it's 4:00 in the afternoon.

03:43.812 --> 03:46.246
Maybe you should get him up and
 go play outside or something.

03:46.315 --> 03:49.011
No, he said he's gonna
 spend the rest of the day...

03:49.084 --> 03:51.279
... figuring out how
 he is gonna pay his bills.

03:51.353 --> 03:53.821
So he's got little doll bills, huh?
That's cute.

03:53.889 --> 03:55.083
- Shut up!
- Not really.

03:55.157 --> 03:58.217
He says that no matter how hard you work,
or how much you do...

03:58.293 --> 04:00.090
... you are always gonna be in the hole.

04:00.162 --> 04:02.460
Sometimes he says:
 "Get out of my face...

04:02.531 --> 04:05.091
... if you got a problem with that,
 I will cut you. "

04:05.167 --> 04:06.657
- He says all that?
- Yes.

04:06.735 --> 04:09.067
And his medicine costs a lot of money too.

04:09.138 --> 04:12.835
Then I will tell you what? Here is a check
for $1 million in fund money.

04:12.908 --> 04:16.605
- I bet that will make him really happy.
-  Yeah, maybe this will put the day in it.

04:16.678 --> 04:19.476
I sure thank you. I know he does too.

04:19.915 --> 04:21.348
- Do you think this is a game?
- Yes.

04:21.416 --> 04:23.112
Do you think I live in pretend land?

04:23.185 --> 04:25.415
Shoot. What's gonna make you happy?

04:25.487 --> 04:28.251
Pills, Ok? Give me some pills.

04:28.323 --> 04:31.724
-  Frylock, where are the pills?
- Pills? What do you need pills for?

04:31.794 --> 04:33.694
Happy-Time Harry needs them.

04:33.762 --> 04:36.424
He says that the pills make
the phone calls go away.

04:36.498 --> 04:37.931
OK, Meatwad...

04:38.000 --> 04:42.596
... this is a perscription from
Dr. Frylock for jolly sunshine happiness.

04:42.671 --> 04:45.731
Do you think this is a game?
They will garnish his raises...

04:45.808 --> 04:49.369
... and  how is gonna pay child
support then, huh? I'll tell you. He ain't.

04:49.445 --> 04:53.347
I don't think I like your tone. And I
damn sure don't like your doll.

04:53.415 --> 04:56.782
What's this I hear about you
needing pills and money?

04:57.152 --> 04:59.484
- Not on the rug.
- Oh my god, you reek of liquor.

04:59.555 --> 05:00.817
Yes, let's open a window.

05:00.889 --> 05:03.289
Look man. All you had was root
 beer and triple sesh.

05:03.358 --> 05:05.087
I was going to make margaritas with that.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.618
Man, you had tequila the
whole time? Where-Where is it?

05:08.697 --> 05:11.291
Meatwad, I thought this
was a happy-time dancing doll.

05:11.366 --> 05:14.460
Nah dude. I had to get
 totally ripped to dance.

05:15.204 --> 05:17.399
This is kinda dark.

05:19.141 --> 05:22.304
- Flip him over. That's how Hendrix died.
- No, just leave it.

05:22.377 --> 05:25.972
- He is gonna die soon anyway.
- What kind of attitude is that?

05:26.048 --> 05:29.074
Why don't you open your eyes and take
 a look at the world around you, man?

05:29.151 --> 05:30.812
You can see that there ain't  no point.

05:30.886 --> 05:34.185
Tomorrow, I'm getting you a new doll
with a sunnier attitude.

05:34.289 --> 05:38.191
While you are there, you get me that
happy- time dialysis machine, alright?

05:38.260 --> 05:39.852
- Dialysis?
- Yes

05:39.928 --> 05:44.365
I had half my liver removed once and I
am not supposed to drink, but I do.

05:46.535 --> 05:47.535
The villagers are frightened.

05:47.603 --> 05:49.764
They need a sacrifice
to the mighty gorilla!

05:49.838 --> 05:53.672
- You must have something else!
- No, you done destroyed everything.

05:53.742 --> 05:56.734
What about if I do this
on the carpet, huh?

05:58.247 --> 06:00.875
- How do you like that one?
- Who is this jackass ?

06:00.949 --> 06:02.883
Would somebody tell him
I am trying to sleep?

06:02.951 --> 06:04.303
It's my jackass roommate.

06:04.686 --> 06:07.139
Is that your new doll?
Your Dancing doll, huh?

06:07.189 --> 06:11.683
Oh, you will be dancing alright.
Inside the flame.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.127
Do it, he don't care. I don't care.
We all gonna die.

06:15.197 --> 06:17.290
He is in my hand right now...

06:17.366 --> 06:20.460
... He is going away and
he is never coming back.

06:23.405 --> 06:25.168
-  Are you sleeping?
- I have seen it, OK?

06:25.240 --> 06:29.438
- Just take him in and do it.
- Go ahead, man. Let's do this thing.

06:29.511 --> 06:32.969
I told you I would do it. I am gonna
do it now. Hey Meatwad, look at this.

06:33.048 --> 06:36.506
Come near the window. Big time
fun if you know what I mean.

06:36.685 --> 06:38.880
- Ok, dude. I just did all the prep work.
- Yep. Yeah.

06:38.954 --> 06:40.888
Let 's get it on. Do it!

06:42.090 --> 06:44.991
Do it? I mean I was just
gonna sorta blow your jaw...

06:45.060 --> 06:48.587
... with a firecracker or something.
I was not going to, you know...

06:50.165 --> 06:52.099
I think I need to go pray.

06:52.167 --> 06:54.897
Hey, that milkshake's
got no guts, man.

06:54.970 --> 06:59.430
You know everytime just being around
you kinda makes me wanna die.

07:00.475 --> 07:02.875
Look who's showed up.
We have a visitor.

07:02.945 --> 07:05.846
Tarnation! I'm Jiggle Billy!

07:06.215 --> 07:10.242
And look, he brought his expensive night
vision goggles for night jiggling.

07:10.352 --> 07:13.412
Come on, ya'll. Commence the jiggling.

07:14.156 --> 07:16.590
<i>Swing your partner
round and round</i>

07:18.694 --> 07:19.956
I will leave ya'll alone.

07:20.028 --> 07:23.964
Looks like ya'll are gonna have
yourself a rooting tooting jig-off.

07:25.234 --> 07:28.863
- We jiggling or...
- Hey,  backwoods retard...

07:29.538 --> 07:31.699
...not now, not ever.

07:32.274 --> 07:35.072
OK. Naptime.

07:35.978 --> 07:39.470
- You think they are getting along out there?
- Yeah look. I mean, they are just playing.

07:39.548 --> 07:41.982
They are just having fun.
You know how dolls are.

07:42.050 --> 07:44.610
They are always having
tea parties or something.

07:44.686 --> 07:47.587
- Drinking tea and... Oh goodness.
- No, that's no tea party.

07:47.656 --> 07:48.850
Maybe I should go out there.

07:48.924 --> 07:51.654
Frylock, you stay far away from
that doll with the red shoes...

07:51.727 --> 07:53.126
... if you know what's good for you.

07:53.195 --> 07:57.598
You know, sometimes, I like to take
this knife and just cut myself.

07:59.268 --> 08:02.999
See how hard I could do it
before I just pass out, man.

08:04.097 --> 08:11.765
- Whoo yeah, well. Commence the jiggling, huh?
- Hey, Wiggle Jiggle...

08:11.813 --> 08:14.213
...let me ask you something.
Why do you dance so much?

08:14.283 --> 08:15.750
I don't know!

08:15.817 --> 08:19.378
"Cause deep inside, you
know that you are a fraud...

08:19.888 --> 08:22.482
... that you are a lie, that you a sham?

08:22.557 --> 08:24.821
No. I-I just...

08:25.360 --> 08:28.261
Come on, everybody likes to jiggle.

08:28.530 --> 08:29.997
- Right.
- No..

08:31.233 --> 08:34.100
Phone call for meatwad. Very important.

08:34.354 --> 08:37.501
Hey, man. You know why you
came in that box, right?

08:37.572 --> 08:40.268
It's 'cause someone put
you there to die.

08:40.342 --> 08:44.836
Now, that ain't true now. I got-I
got me these night vision goggles!

08:44.913 --> 08:47.006
For what? You are a hillbilly.

08:47.082 --> 08:51.451
You don't even know who you are, do ya?
Look to you. You are a clown, ajoke.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.886
I do not know why I have these goggles.

08:53.955 --> 08:57.447
I wonder who this is? It
sure sounds official.

08:57.526 --> 08:59.926
Hello? No-No thank you.

08:59.995 --> 09:03.294
Yes! I sold your
name to charity!

09:03.365 --> 09:05.833
- Remove my name off the list.
- Now, you are gonna get some calls.

09:05.901 --> 09:08.961
- Yes thank you.
- And they just keep coming.

09:11.673 --> 09:15.302
- You wish-You wish I had never did this.
- No, I am off the list now.

09:15.377 --> 09:17.504
Yeah, he is off the list. It's over.

09:17.579 --> 09:21.037
Something is going to happen!
Why won't you get pissed off?

09:21.450 --> 09:23.645
- What was that?
- Jiggle Billy!

09:24.219 --> 09:26.779
I had nothing to do with it, man.
He did it himself...

09:26.855 --> 09:29.449
... 'cause he couldn't
stand being with you.

09:29.524 --> 09:33.517
- You serious? Look, he still jiggling.
- No, that's something else.

09:33.595 --> 09:37.964
Hi pardner! I am still alive.
I'm just real depressed.

09:38.033 --> 09:40.399
That's it. You are out
of here like last year.

09:40.469 --> 09:43.836
Oh yeah? You got what it takes, man?
Huh, do ya? Pull the trigger.

09:43.905 --> 09:46.169
Pull the trigger. Pull it! now!

09:46.241 --> 09:48.374
No, don't do it.
That's what he wants.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.507
So, we are gonns do the opposite.

09:50.612 --> 09:53.103
Prepare to be immortal!

09:53.949 --> 09:55.541
You gonna chuck him off a cliff?

09:55.617 --> 09:58.142
Shake, we could have chucked him
off the roof and stayed at home.

09:58.220 --> 10:01.155
<i>No, this is a magic cliff here,
like in The Highlander.</i>

10:01.223 --> 10:04.124
So, you will become
the Highlander...

10:04.192 --> 10:07.286
... and you will roam the earth
forever, trying to kill youself...

10:07.362 --> 10:10.889
... but you won't be able to
because you will be immortal.

10:11.199 --> 10:13.326
Won't that suck, little man?

10:14.202 --> 10:16.796
- Actually, that sounds kinda cool.
- Yeah, it does.

10:16.872 --> 10:19.067
- Then I am gonna do it.
- No, you are not. I am doing it.

10:19.141 --> 10:20.165
Shake, wait!

10:20.242 --> 10:22.210
<i>The Highlander was
just a movie. I mean...</i>

10:22.277 --> 10:25.212
<i>Frylock, The Highlander
was a documentary...</i>

10:25.280 --> 10:27.748
... and the events
happened in real time.

10:27.816 --> 10:30.580
- So, this cliff is magic?
- Oh yeah.

10:30.652 --> 10:32.517
- I am doing it now.
- No, man, look...

10:32.587 --> 10:35.886
... you gotta be born a Highlander.
You can't just become one.

10:35.957 --> 10:38.118
- See, he saw the movie too.
- You know, that's right.

10:38.193 --> 10:41.993
You know, I saw cliffs, OK.
And there was  lots of magic everywhere.

10:42.063 --> 10:44.463
<i>- And Mel Gibson...
- Braveheart? Hello?</i>

10:44.533 --> 10:45.533
Well, you think you
are the expert?

10:45.600 --> 10:48.660
See how much your
ass knows about flying.

10:49.004 --> 10:51.127
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about!

10:51.162 --> 10:52.599
You done? Because
that took forever.

10:52.674 --> 10:54.904
I am-I am forever.

10:55.510 --> 10:57.341
- I'm immortal!
- Shake, no!

10:57.412 --> 10:58.743
Damn trunk!

10:58.814 --> 11:01.146
Wait! I'm not immortal here, OK?

11:01.216 --> 11:03.878
- Hang on, Shake. We'll call for help.
- No, tell him to let go.

11:03.952 --> 11:07.251
Hurry. I think that the
branch will hold for...

11:07.322 --> 11:08.721
It's not holding!

11:08.890 --> 11:12.121
So, I guess the highlander
comes out of traction today.

11:12.194 --> 11:15.755
Well, I hope they fixed his eyes. They  got
messed up pretty bad now in that fall.

11:15.831 --> 11:18.664
Well, the doctors gave him some
hard plastic replacements.

11:18.733 --> 11:21.759
So don't stare at him, OK. He is
real self conscious about it.
