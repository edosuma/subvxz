00:50.181 --> 00:52.583
в™Є IT'S THE SALE

00:52.583 --> 00:57.628
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:57.628 --> 01:00.231
WELL, THIS LOOKS LIKE
THE LAST OF IT.

01:00.231 --> 01:02.093
WHY ARE YOU SELLING
OUR ICE CREAM MAKER?

01:02.093 --> 01:03.494
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD IT
FOR TWO YEARS,

01:03.494 --> 01:06.297
AND YOU'VE MADE ICE CREAM
EXACTLY ZERO TIMES.

01:06.297 --> 01:07.668
MAYBE I'LL MAKE SOME NOW.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.401
LET'S SEE. ALL RIGHT.

01:10.401 --> 01:11.772
ALL WE NEED IS, UM...

01:11.772 --> 01:14.375
SOME MILK, SOME SUGAR, CREAM.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.207
WE THROW THIS BUCKET
INTO THE FREEZER FOR AN HOUR.

01:16.207 --> 01:19.310
THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE
A MIXING APPARATUS AND...

01:19.310 --> 01:21.081
SCREW IT. 5 BUCKS?

01:21.081 --> 01:22.383
DONE.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.515
I HATE YARD SALES.
IT'S JUST A BOTTOM-FEEDERS

01:24.515 --> 01:26.817
BUYING AND SELLING
EACH OTHER'S TRASH.

01:26.817 --> 01:29.220
OH! A PAIR OF USED CRUTCHES!

01:29.220 --> 01:31.522
SWORD FIGHT?
YEAH!

01:34.365 --> 01:35.766
BOTTOM-FEEDERS.

01:35.766 --> 01:37.628
HEY, ARE YOU SELLING
THE ICE CREAM MAKER?

01:37.628 --> 01:38.869
5 BUCKS.

01:38.869 --> 01:40.371
SWEET! IS IT EASY IT USE?

01:40.371 --> 01:43.103
IT'S EASIER THAN...

01:43.103 --> 01:45.436
ELLIE, LITTLE HELP?
IT'S EASIER THAN...

01:45.436 --> 01:51.212
JULES AFTER A BOTTLE OF WINE
AND A COMPLIMENT ON HER CALVES.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.214
YOU THINK MY CALVES
ARE NICE?

01:53.214 --> 01:55.186
I'LL TAKE IT.

01:55.186 --> 01:56.447
OH!

01:56.447 --> 01:59.550
HOW MUCH FOR
THIS FINE DISH TOWEL?

01:59.550 --> 02:01.792
HMM. 35 CENTS, YOU SAY?

02:01.792 --> 02:03.494
(clicking)

02:03.494 --> 02:05.626
OKAY, WELL, THE NICKELS
ARE JAMMED. HOW ABOUT 30?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.228
(coins clatter)

02:07.228 --> 02:08.559
WELL, THIS IS HORRIBLE.

02:08.559 --> 02:10.661
I LOVE YARD SALE SEASON.

02:10.661 --> 02:12.803
A TIME FOR BUYING,
A TIME FOR SELLING.

02:12.803 --> 02:15.466
TIME FOR FINDING
THAT PERFECT PRESSURE COOKER

02:15.466 --> 02:17.608
YOU NEVER KNEW
YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

02:17.608 --> 02:19.210
AND THE CYCLE CONTINUES.

02:19.210 --> 02:21.172
YOU BUY A BUNCH OF CRAP,

02:21.172 --> 02:22.673
NO ONE BUYS OURS,

02:22.673 --> 02:24.315
AND OUR GARAGE BECOMES
THE DUMP SITE

02:24.315 --> 02:27.218
FOR ALL THE UNWASHED LOSERS
OF GULFHAVEN.

02:27.218 --> 02:29.450
MAYBE IF YOU'RE NOT SO SNARKY
TO OUR CUSTOMERS,

02:29.450 --> 02:32.423
WE'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE
TO SELL SOME STUFF THIS YEAR.

02:32.423 --> 02:34.225
WHAT'S THE FUN
OF HAVING A YARD SALE

02:34.225 --> 02:36.687
IF YOU CAN'T MOCK THE LOWLIFES
THAT SHOP THERE? PFFT.

02:36.687 --> 02:38.259
IF WE SELL THE NordicTrack

02:38.259 --> 02:39.690
AND THE OLD-TIMEY
POPCORN MACHINE,

02:39.690 --> 02:42.793
WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIT YOUR TRUCK
INTO THE GARAGE.

02:42.793 --> 02:47.167
OKAY. I WILL KEEP
MY NASTY THOUGHTS TO MYSELF...

02:47.167 --> 02:50.771
THOUGHTS LIKE
YOUR LITTLE CARNY CHANGE BELT

02:50.771 --> 02:53.904
MAKES ME WANNA EMPTY THE COINS
INTO A SOCK

02:53.904 --> 02:55.846
AND BEAT YOU OVER THE HEAD.

02:55.846 --> 02:58.449
WE'RE OFF TO A GOOD START.

02:58.449 --> 02:59.750
YOU WANNA HELP?

02:59.750 --> 03:01.252
THIS YARD SALE
IS THE PERFECT CHANCE

03:01.252 --> 03:03.214
FOR YOU TO GET RID OF
SOME OF THIS CRAP.

03:03.214 --> 03:04.755
(clatter)
CRAP?

03:04.755 --> 03:06.417
EVERYTHING ON THIS BOAT
SERVES A PURPOSE.

03:06.417 --> 03:07.788
HOW ABOUT THIS BROKEN TV?

03:07.788 --> 03:09.220
THAT'S MY PIGGY BANK.

03:09.220 --> 03:10.821
THIS... EMPTY PAINT CAN?

03:10.821 --> 03:12.523
EARLY PROTOTYPE OF PENNY CAN.

03:12.523 --> 03:14.225
THAT THING COULD BE IN
THE HALL OF FAME ONE DAY, BUDDY.

03:14.225 --> 03:15.496
WHAT ABOUT THIS?
(object thuds)

03:15.496 --> 03:17.428
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

03:17.428 --> 03:19.800
IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S
A BUNCH OF DIRT IN IT.
(rustling)

03:19.800 --> 03:21.372
THOSE ARE ASHES

03:21.372 --> 03:24.275
FROM YOUR GREAT-GRANDPAPPY
ROBBIE COBB.

03:24.275 --> 03:25.606
WELL, THAT DEFINITELY SURPASSES
THE DUCK SKELETON

03:25.606 --> 03:26.807
AS THE CREEPIEST THING
ON THE BOAT.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.609
I WAS HIS FAVORITE GRANDSON,

03:28.609 --> 03:31.882
AND HIS DYING WISH WAS FOR ME
TO SCATTER THOSE ASHES

03:31.882 --> 03:33.944
ON A ROLLER COASTER.

03:33.944 --> 03:35.646
CRAZY AS THAT IS,
MY MAIN QUESTION IS,

03:35.646 --> 03:37.888
WHAT IS IT STILL DOING HERE?!

03:37.888 --> 03:40.591
I MEAN, DIDN'T HE DIE, LIKE,
15 YEARS AGO?

03:40.591 --> 03:41.852
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

03:41.852 --> 03:43.594
YOU KNOW, THE BOAT ALWAYS
NEEDS FIXIN',

03:43.594 --> 03:47.358
AND HANGING OUT WITH YOUR MOM
TAKES UP A BIG CHUNK OF TIME,

03:47.358 --> 03:48.959
AND I'VE GOT
BEARD MAINTENANCE.

03:48.959 --> 03:50.561
WHAT--WHAT'S UP
WITH ALL THE QUESTIONS?

03:50.561 --> 03:52.803
MAN, WHO MADE YOU
KING OF THE BOAT?

03:56.437 --> 03:58.639
HEY, ENJOY THAT BUNDLE
OF EXTENSION CORDS.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.372
IF YOU EVER GET 'EM UNTANGLED,
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE 'EM.

04:01.372 --> 04:02.943
HE'S NEVER GETTING 'EM
UNTANGLED.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.675
THAT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU,

04:04.675 --> 04:07.618
TAKING HIS MONEY FOR SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT NOT WORK?

04:07.618 --> 04:09.420
LAURIE, YOU DON'T GET
YARD SALES.

04:09.420 --> 04:11.822
PEOPLE JUST WANNA BUY
SOMETHING FOR 50 CENTS.

04:11.822 --> 04:14.024
IF THE THING WORKS,
IT'S A BONUS.

04:14.024 --> 04:16.327
I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT,
JULES.

04:16.327 --> 04:18.489
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD THINK
ABOUT KARMA.

04:18.489 --> 04:20.791
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT MY FRIEND
KARMA DAVIS,

04:20.791 --> 04:22.593
THE FIERCEST FEMALE WRESTLER
IN ALL OF TAMPA.

04:22.593 --> 04:24.264
YOU KNOW SHE ONCE PUT
ONE OF HER OPPONENTS

04:24.264 --> 04:26.266
IN A FIGURE FOUR LEG LOCK
SO TIGHT,

04:26.266 --> 04:27.638
THEY NEVER GOT OUT?

04:27.638 --> 04:29.570
THEY'RE LIKE
SIAMESE LEG TWINS NOW.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.543
THAT IS SUPER. I'M GONNA
GIVE THAT SOME THOUGHT.

04:32.543 --> 04:34.044
(singsongy) CHECK IT OUT!

04:34.044 --> 04:36.947
(normal voice)
I GOT THESE BAGPIPES,

04:36.947 --> 04:38.479
THIS STUFFED PORCUPINE,

04:38.479 --> 04:40.781
A STRANGER'S WEDDING VIDEO,
AND...

04:40.781 --> 04:42.753
(singsongy) A SHAKE WEIGHT!
(rattles)

04:42.753 --> 04:44.014
AND TO THINK, IF WE EVER
GET DIVORCED,

04:44.014 --> 04:46.657
HALF OF THAT WILL BE MINE.

04:46.657 --> 04:50.391
IT'S A 50-CENT PACK OF CARDS.
NO NEED TO MULL IT OVER.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.763
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GONNA
BE SNARKY TO THE CUSTOMERS.

04:52.763 --> 04:54.064
I THOUGHT SO, TOO,

04:54.064 --> 04:55.826
BUT THEN A BUNCH OF LOSERS
INVADED MY YARD,

04:55.826 --> 04:57.598
AND I CHANGED MY MIND.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.300
ARE YOU EVEN PHYSICALLY ABLE
TO NOT BE SNARKY?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.603
I AM, IF I'M NOT SURROUNDED
BY IDIOTS,

05:02.603 --> 05:04.405
WHICH IS ALMOST NEVER.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.706
OKAY, PROVE IT.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.579
IF YOU CAN BE NOT SNARKY
FOR ONE WHOLE DAY,

05:08.579 --> 05:11.882
I'LL GET RID OF ALL THIS STUFF
I BOUGHT AT THE YARD SALE TODAY.

05:11.882 --> 05:13.984
LAST FIVE YARD SALES.

05:13.984 --> 05:16.487
DEAL. BUT IF YOU LOSE,

05:16.487 --> 05:20.020
YOU HAVE TO WEAR
THIS INFLATABLE SUMO SUIT.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.654
(shouts indistinctly)

05:23.654 --> 05:24.925
DEAL.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.627
HEY, JULES.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.759
HOW'S THE, UH, SUCTION
ON THIS VACUUM?

05:28.759 --> 05:30.000
WHEN I TURN IT ON,
IT MAKES A LOUD NOISE.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.002
SO I'D SAY GOOD AND SUCKY.

05:32.002 --> 05:33.734
I'LL TAKE IT.
ALL RIGHT.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.066
HERE YOU GO.
HOPE YOU LOVE
HOW MUCH IT SUCKS.

05:36.066 --> 05:38.809
YOU TOLD ME THAT VACUUM
BARELY WORKS.

05:38.809 --> 05:41.372
WELL, I DECIDED TO FOCUS
ON THE "WORKS" PART

05:41.372 --> 05:42.743
AND IGNORE THE "BARELY."

05:42.743 --> 05:46.577
THAT'S JUST GOOD SALESMANSHIP.
(sea bird calling)

05:46.577 --> 05:49.480
OH. I JUST GOT CRAPPED ON
BY A BIRD!

05:49.480 --> 05:51.982
NO, JULES. THAT WAS KARMA.

05:51.982 --> 05:54.525
YOU JUST GOT CRAPPED ON
BY KARMA.

05:54.525 --> 05:55.886
OH, WOULD YOU STOP IT, LAURIE?

05:55.886 --> 05:58.058
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS KAR... UGH!

05:59.830 --> 06:02.863
(exhales)
BIRDS FLY IN FLOCKS, OKAY?

06:02.863 --> 06:05.065
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.868
I'M NOT GETTING ANY POOP.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.740
(gruff voice)
AHOY, LANDLUBBER.

06:09.740 --> 06:12.943
LOOK WHAT I GOT
AT THE YARD SALE FOR $5.

06:12.943 --> 06:14.845
(normal voice) DON'T I MAKE
A GREAT SEA CAPTAIN?

06:14.845 --> 06:17.107
STERN! JIB!
(imitates sea captain) SCURVY.

06:17.107 --> 06:20.050
YOU LOOK LIKE A GUY WEARING
FUNNY CLOTHES.

06:20.050 --> 06:22.152
WHAT IF I TALKED LIKE THIS?

06:22.152 --> 06:24.585
(imitating New England accent)
THERE'S A PERFECT STORM COMING.

06:24.585 --> 06:27.418
PARK THE CAR IN HARVARD YARD.

06:27.418 --> 06:28.859
OI, MATE!

06:28.859 --> 06:30.621
COME HERE.
THERE'S A STORM ON THE BREW.

06:30.621 --> 06:31.922
YOU START SELLIN' FISH STICKS?

06:31.922 --> 06:33.424
DAD, I THINK I KNOW

06:33.424 --> 06:35.626
WHY YOU HAVEN'T SPREAD
GRANDPAPPY'S ASHES.

06:35.626 --> 06:37.127
YOU START THINKING ABOUT
HOW EMBARRASSING IT IS

06:37.127 --> 06:38.629
TO BE DESCENDED FROM A MAN

06:38.629 --> 06:40.100
THAT WOULD MAKE
SUCH AN INSANE REQUEST,

06:40.100 --> 06:42.072
AND YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
HOW THAT REFLECTS ON YOU,

06:42.072 --> 06:43.704
AND THAT MAYBE THAT SAYS
SOMETHING NEGATIVE

06:43.704 --> 06:45.175
ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS A MAN--

06:45.175 --> 06:47.878
DAMN IT, TRAVIS, I'M AFRAID
OF ROLLER COASTERS!

06:47.878 --> 06:50.641
WHY DO YOU KEEP
TORTURING ME?

06:50.641 --> 06:53.714
(sighs)
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.517
OKAY, I GOT $43
IN CASH MONEY

06:56.517 --> 06:58.118
AND AN ASSLOAD OF CHANGE.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.620
OH, IT'S LIKE A WEAPON.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.092
UHH! I COULD TAKE OUT
A BEAR! MM!

07:02.092 --> 07:05.456
WOW. GREAT HAUL.
I COULDN'T SELL ANYTHING.

07:05.456 --> 07:06.827
WHAT WERE YOU SELLING?

07:06.827 --> 07:09.129
OH, THE USUAL--
CDs, DEAD WIFE'S SHOES,

07:09.129 --> 07:11.932
USED SCALPELS, FORCEPS,
SURGICAL MASKS.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.936
OH, COME ON, TOM.
SOMETIMES YOU JUST DON'T THINK.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.768
YOU MIGHT'VE BONED THE SALE,

07:17.768 --> 07:20.170
BUT AT LEAST YOU DIDN'T JANK
YOUR KARMA BY LYING TO EVERYONE.

07:20.170 --> 07:22.072
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS KARMA,
BECAUSE IF THERE WAS,

07:22.072 --> 07:23.974
I WOULDN'T BE CELEBRATING
WITH THIS BOTTLE OF BUBBLY.

07:23.974 --> 07:25.816
(corks pops)
(Laurie screams)

07:25.816 --> 07:29.480
(horror movie theme playing)
(slo-mo voice) TIPPI, NO!

07:32.753 --> 07:34.755
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA
SAY ANYTHING.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.557
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.088
THAT WAS KARMA!

07:44.064 --> 07:46.196
WE ARE GATHERED HERE
TO CELEBRATE

07:46.196 --> 07:49.600
THE TRAGICALLY SHORT LIFE
OF BIG TIPPI.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.141
(voice breaks) OH, GOD.
IT JUST GETS HARDER EVERY TIME.

07:51.141 --> 07:52.943
COME HERE.

07:52.943 --> 07:54.805
LOOK, I KNOW WE GO THROUGH THIS
PRETTY MUCH EVERY YEAR,

07:54.805 --> 07:57.648
BUT, UH, THIS IS INSANE.

07:57.648 --> 07:59.510
BIG TIPPI IS FAMILY.

07:59.510 --> 08:01.652
SO ZIP IT, CAP'N CRUNCH.

08:01.652 --> 08:03.253
BIG TIPPI,

08:03.253 --> 08:06.256
YOU WERE THE BEST THING
TO COME OUT OF LOS ANGELES.

08:06.256 --> 08:08.118
EXCEPT FOR
THE FAKE ACADEMY AWARD I GOT

08:08.118 --> 08:09.720
FOR BEST SUPPORTING LOVER.

08:09.720 --> 08:10.991
(kisses)

08:10.991 --> 08:12.563
THERE IS NO GREATER TRAGEDY

08:12.563 --> 08:15.526
THAN OUTLIVING
YOUR OWN WINE GLASS.

08:15.526 --> 08:20.000
(door closes)
(playing "Amazing Grace")

08:20.000 --> 08:22.102
WHEN DID YOU LEARN TO PLAY
THE BAGPIPES?

08:22.102 --> 08:23.934
(panting)

08:23.934 --> 08:25.636
MIDDLE SCHOOL BAND.

08:25.636 --> 08:27.708
A FRIEND TOLD ME IT WOULD
HELP ME GET GIRLS.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.939
TURNED OUT IT REALLY WASN'T
A FRIEND.

08:28.939 --> 08:30.911
MORE LIKE A CLEVER BULLY.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.183
SO SORRY ABOUT BIG TIPPI, JULES.

08:33.183 --> 08:34.845
WHAT A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.

08:34.845 --> 08:36.687
THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT.

08:36.687 --> 08:38.549
THIS WAS KARMA.

08:38.549 --> 08:39.950
YOUR WRESTLER FRIEND
FROM TAMPA?

08:39.950 --> 08:41.552
NO.

08:41.552 --> 08:44.224
NO, I LIED, AND NOW THE UNIVERSE
IS PISSED AT ME.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.526
LAURIE, PLEASE HELP ME GET
THE UNIVERSE TO LIKE ME AGAIN.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.629
AT LEAST YOU'RE HONORING
TIPPI'S MEMORY

08:48.629 --> 08:51.832
AND NOT WUSSING OUT BECAUSE
YOU'RE AFRAID OF A LOOP-DE-LOOP.

08:53.664 --> 08:56.867
ORDINARILY, I'D BE MACHINE GUN
SNARKING THIS MOMENT.

08:56.867 --> 09:00.971
(imitates rapid gunfire)

09:00.971 --> 09:02.542
(makes gurgling sound)

09:02.542 --> 09:04.875
(penny clinks)

09:04.875 --> 09:07.748
THAT'S JUST ABOUT
THE SADDEST GAME OF PENNY CAN

09:07.748 --> 09:08.979
I'VE EVER SEEN.

09:08.979 --> 09:10.250
(penny clinks)

09:10.250 --> 09:12.182
SO YOU'RE AFRAID
OF ROLLER COASTERS.

09:12.182 --> 09:13.954
EVER SINCE I WAS
A LITTLE KID.

09:13.954 --> 09:17.788
YOU KNOW, I JUST CAN'T STAND
THOSE BIG, LOOPY RICKETY...

09:17.788 --> 09:20.761
DAD, I THINK I KNOW WHAT TO DO
ABOUT GRANDPAPPY COBB.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.594
WHAT, THROW HIM IN DUMPSTER
AND FORGET THE WHOLE THING?
NOPE.

09:23.594 --> 09:26.566
YOU'RE GONNA GET OVER YOUR FEAR
OF ROLLER COASTERS.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.699
SORRY, SON. I JUST CAN'T.

09:28.699 --> 09:31.672
NOT EVEN FOR A GOOD MAN
LIKE GRANDPAPPY COBB.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.905
HE TAUGHT ME THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A SEA LION AND A SEAL.

09:34.905 --> 09:37.147
THE EARS, TRAV.

09:37.147 --> 09:38.979
EARS.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.751
HE DESERVED BETTER.

09:40.751 --> 09:43.013
AND THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA
HELP YOU BEAT THIS THING.

09:43.013 --> 09:44.314
YEAH? HOW?

09:44.314 --> 09:46.156
(whispers) TECHNOLOGY.

09:46.156 --> 09:49.059
I'M GONNA DIE! STOP THE RIDE!

09:49.059 --> 09:50.821
YOU'RE DOING GREAT!

09:50.821 --> 09:53.593
TRAV, I'M GONNA DIE! PLEASE!

09:53.593 --> 09:54.865
HEY, HON.

09:54.865 --> 09:56.627
HOW'S YOUR DAY
OF NO SNARK GOIN'?

09:56.627 --> 09:58.929
I AM MANAGING.
OH, THAT'S GREAT,

09:58.929 --> 10:00.300
'CAUSE I GOT SOME STUFF
I WANNA SHOW YOU

10:00.300 --> 10:01.832
THAT I GOT
FROM THE YARD SALE.

10:01.832 --> 10:05.205
HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY PINK FUZZY BATHROBE

10:05.205 --> 10:07.607
AND MY 1970s ERA

10:07.607 --> 10:09.710
WACKY ELTON JOHN GLASSES?

10:09.710 --> 10:10.941
HMM?

10:10.941 --> 10:12.612
(voice cracks) I...

10:12.612 --> 10:15.345
(whispers) LOVE...
I LOVE IT.

10:15.345 --> 10:17.087
THEN YOU WON'T MIND
IF I GET CHEEKY

10:17.087 --> 10:19.119
AND DANCE AROUND A LITTLE BIT,
WILL YOU?

10:19.119 --> 10:21.221
(giggles)

10:21.221 --> 10:24.755
I FEEL SO FREE AND LIGHT.

10:24.755 --> 10:27.958
HONEY, IF YOU DO GOOD DEEDS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE,

10:27.958 --> 10:29.259
GOOD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
FOR YOU.

10:29.259 --> 10:30.931
LIKE THIS ONE TIME
I WAS AT A CLUB,

10:30.931 --> 10:32.402
AND A GIRL NEEDED A SHIRT,

10:32.402 --> 10:34.264
SO I LITERALLY GAVE HER
THE SHIRT OFF OF MY BACK.

10:34.264 --> 10:37.307
NEXT THING I KNOW, GUYS ARE
STUFFING MONEY INTO MY PANTS.

10:37.307 --> 10:39.309
A-BOOM! TEXTBOOK KARMA.

10:39.309 --> 10:41.942
GOOD DEEDS. THAT'S EASY.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.844
OH, HERE. LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THAT, HANDSOME.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.375
OH.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.847
WOW.
THERE YOU GO.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.218
OH, THANKS, JULES.

10:48.218 --> 10:50.320
SO LONG, SOCIAL ANXIETY!
(pills rattle)

10:50.320 --> 10:52.022
(forced laugh) OKAY.

10:52.022 --> 10:54.384
I'VE SO GOT THIS.
YEAH.

10:58.989 --> 11:00.360
(clicks tongue)

11:00.360 --> 11:01.792
LET ME HELP YOU WITH THESE.

11:01.792 --> 11:03.934
HERE YOU GO. FOR YOU.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.298
ALL RIGHT, TAKE A STEP UP.

11:08.298 --> 11:10.971
ALL RIGHT. HAVE A NICE DAY.

11:15.806 --> 11:18.849
OKAY. HERE I COME!

11:18.849 --> 11:20.951
HERE IS A BEAUTIFUL
3-BEDROOM, 3-BATH COLONIAL

11:20.951 --> 11:23.013
IN GULFHAVEN PRIME.

11:23.013 --> 11:24.855
OKAY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU--

11:24.855 --> 11:26.787
THE ELECTRICAL IS SHOT,
AND THE KITCHEN CABINETS ARE...

11:26.787 --> 11:28.388
(whispers) CRAPSVILLE.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.060
OH, ALSO, THERE WAS A MURDER
IN THE HOUSE TEN YEARS AGO

11:30.060 --> 11:31.321
IN THE BASEMENT.

11:31.321 --> 11:33.794
NOW, HONESTLY,
I'VE NEVER SEEN A GHOST,

11:33.794 --> 11:35.726
BUT DON'T ASK ME ABOUT
THE POSSUMS.

11:35.726 --> 11:39.229
OKAY, IT'S LIKE THEY'RE BUILDING
A SECRET ARMY.

11:42.232 --> 11:44.805
(whirring)
OH, MAN, THIS IS GOING FAST!

11:44.805 --> 11:46.076
LAURIE, MORE WIND!

11:46.076 --> 11:47.978
(whirring loudly)

11:47.978 --> 11:49.910
CUE STUFF FALLING OUT
OF POCKETS!

11:49.910 --> 11:52.482
OH!
UH-OH! THIS LADY FORGOT
TO ZIP HER PURSE.

11:52.482 --> 11:54.144
AAH!
(coins clatter)

11:54.144 --> 11:55.715
LETTING YOU PUT THIS
GREEN SCREEN IN MY APARTMENT

11:55.715 --> 11:57.247
WAS ONE OF THE WORST MISTAKES
OF MY LIFE--

11:57.247 --> 11:59.890
AND I WAS WENT ON VACATION
WITH DENNIS RODMAN, Y'ALL.

11:59.890 --> 12:02.352
OH, NO! NO, MAN,
NOT THE CORKSCREW!

12:02.352 --> 12:05.295
TRAV, STOP IT!
TRAV, STOP IT!
DAD!

12:05.295 --> 12:06.997
(grunts)
DAD, YOU WERE DOING SO GOOD.

12:06.997 --> 12:08.829
GOOD AT ALMOST
CRAPPING MY PANTS!

12:08.829 --> 12:10.931
I CAN'T DO IT, TRAV!

12:13.503 --> 12:15.135
YOU KNOW, ELLIE,

12:15.135 --> 12:17.167
I WAS STARTING TO THINK
THAT MY CAPTAIN'S OUTFIT

12:17.167 --> 12:18.839
WASN'T WORKING FOR ME.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.170
(chuckles) YOU'RE INTO IT,
AREN'T YOU?

12:20.170 --> 12:22.112
CAN'T ANSWER NOW.

12:22.112 --> 12:24.314
BUT... PLEASE,

12:24.314 --> 12:26.817
PLEASE WEAR IT AGAIN
TOMORROW.

12:26.817 --> 12:29.019
AYE AYE, CAPTAIN. (chuckles)

12:29.019 --> 12:31.952
OH, THERE YOU ARE!

12:31.952 --> 12:33.423
(sliding noises)

12:33.423 --> 12:35.155
IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER...

12:35.155 --> 12:36.927
I'D THINK YOU WERE
AVOIDING ME.

12:36.927 --> 12:41.031
OH, LOOK. I'M ONE OF THOSE
BLUE GUYS THAT DESTROYS STUFF.

12:41.031 --> 12:43.533
(flaps lips)
(bowl clatters)

12:43.533 --> 12:46.396
SOMEHOW THAT PASSES
FOR THEATER.

12:46.396 --> 12:49.099
WAIT. YOU SET ME UP.

12:49.099 --> 12:51.271
YOU STARTED THIS BET
SO YOU COULD BUY

12:51.271 --> 12:54.975
LOADS OF YARD SALE CRAP,
AND I COULDN'T MAKE FUN OF YOU.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.978
YES, I DID.
BUT A BET IS A BET.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.951
HEY, DOES ANYONE HAVE
THE TIME?

13:00.951 --> 13:03.483
IT'S 3:00, BOY!

13:03.483 --> 13:07.958
(beatboxing)

13:07.958 --> 13:11.822
I DID SO MANY GOOD DEEDS TODAY,
MY KARMA IS THROUGH THE ROOF.

13:11.822 --> 13:14.194
AH! I COULD PROBABLY MURDER
SOMEBODY AND GET AWAY WITH IT.

13:14.194 --> 13:17.367
(laughs)
IT WAS SO NICE OF YOU

13:17.367 --> 13:19.429
TO TAKE THAT HOMELESS MAN
OUT TO LUNCH.

13:19.429 --> 13:22.132
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A HOBO
SO HAPPY.

13:22.132 --> 13:24.134
OR, YOU KNOW,
A RESTAURANT MANAGER SO ANGRY.

13:24.134 --> 13:25.505
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW

13:25.505 --> 13:27.107
HE WAS GONNA TAKE A BATH
IN THE LOBSTER TANK?

13:27.107 --> 13:28.578
WELL,
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,

13:28.578 --> 13:31.211
HE GOT HIS STEAK FAJITAS,
AND I FIXED MY KARMA.

13:31.211 --> 13:34.084
BRING ON THE GOOD, UNIVERSE.

13:35.385 --> 13:36.917
(Jules and Laurie scream)

13:40.590 --> 13:43.253
WHAT THE HELL, KARMA?!

13:47.597 --> 13:50.200
WELL, THAT WAS FUN.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.102
DOES THE CAR IN YOUR OFFICE
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH

13:52.102 --> 13:54.464
THAT GUY SITTING ON THE CURB
WITH A FOIL BLANKET?

13:54.464 --> 13:55.936
THAT'S THE DRIVER.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.567
APPARENTLY HE WAS
TEXTING AND DRIVING--

13:57.567 --> 13:59.339
SOMETHING I WOULD NEVER DO.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.841
ALTHOUGH I HAVE TAKEN
THE OCCASIONAL DRIVING SELFIE.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.514
WHEN THE WIND HITS YOUR HAIR
AT 70 MILES AN HOUR...
MM.

14:04.514 --> 14:06.947
IT IS, LIKE, NEXT-LEVEL HOT.
(clicks tongue)

14:06.947 --> 14:09.279
I DID SO MUCH GOOD STUFF.

14:09.279 --> 14:11.521
WHAT ELSE COULD KARMA WANT?

14:11.521 --> 14:13.383
SHOULD WE GET A OUIJA BOARD
AND ASK HER?

14:13.383 --> 14:15.855
I HAVE SPENT HALF THE DAY
BITING MY TONGUE

14:15.855 --> 14:19.489
SO I DON'T HAVE TO DRESS UP LIKE
A FAT JAPANESE MAN IN A THONG.

14:19.489 --> 14:22.062
IF YOU GUYS COULD PULL BACK
ON THE CRAZY TALK,

14:22.062 --> 14:23.863
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.266
LAURIE,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

14:26.266 --> 14:28.969
THIS MAY REQUIRE
AN INSANE AMOUNT OF CHARITY--

14:28.969 --> 14:30.901
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
CHARITY DIAZ,

14:30.901 --> 14:32.342
MY LATINA DOPPELGANGER.

14:32.342 --> 14:34.304
UGH. THAT BITCH IS ALWAYS
RUNNING AROUND TOWN

14:34.304 --> 14:36.606
WITH HER BLONDE EXTENSIONS
AND HER DAY-GLO PUSH-UPS BRAS

14:36.606 --> 14:38.208
AND SHE'S LIKE, "ВїQUГ©, QUГ©?"

14:38.208 --> 14:39.509
UGH!

14:39.509 --> 14:41.912
I'VE GOTTA LEAVE
RIGHT THIS SECOND.

14:44.554 --> 14:48.088
(Bobby screaming)

14:48.088 --> 14:51.561
(tape rips)
SO HOW'D YOU GET HERE SO FAST
WITH THE CHAIR STUCK TO YOU?

14:51.561 --> 14:53.463
I COASTED ON THE DOWNHILL PARTS.

14:53.463 --> 14:55.595
I SAW YOU
ZOOMING THROUGH TOWN.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.327
YOU CAME REALLY CLOSE TO HITTING
THOSE TWO CONSTRUCTION GUYS

14:57.327 --> 14:59.499
CARRYING THAT
GIANT PANE OF GLASS.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.471
WHAT KIND OF LOSER IS SO AFRAID
OF ROLLER COASTERS

15:01.471 --> 15:05.235
WHERE HE CAN'T EVEN HONOR HIS
BELOVED GRANDFATHER'S LAST WISH?

15:05.235 --> 15:08.378
OKAY, DAD,
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

15:08.378 --> 15:11.381
I'M AFRAID
OF ROLLER COASTERS, TOO.

15:11.381 --> 15:14.114
AH, YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.146
MNH-MNH.

15:16.146 --> 15:18.148
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME BEFORE?

15:18.148 --> 15:20.290
BECAUSE IT'S
INCREDIBLY EMBARRASSING.

15:20.290 --> 15:22.022
SO I PASSED THAT ONTO YOU?

15:22.022 --> 15:24.654
GOD, I GUESS COASTER FEAR
IS IN MY D.N.A.

15:24.654 --> 15:27.357
YEAH, IT COULD BE GENETIC.
OR...

15:27.357 --> 15:29.929
SURE, WE CAN GO
ON THE COASTER, TRAV.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.431
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW

15:31.431 --> 15:34.104
THERE'S A BOGEYMAN WAITIN'
FOR US ON THE FIRST HILL.

15:34.104 --> 15:35.635
YEAH, LET'S GO FOR A RIDE!

15:35.635 --> 15:38.969
I'M SURE SOMEBODY PUT BACK
THAT MISSING PIECE OF TRACK.

15:38.969 --> 15:40.510
WHEN WE HIT THE LOOP,
KEEP YOUR MOUTH CLOSED

15:40.510 --> 15:42.042
'CAUSE THERE'S 100% CHANCE

15:42.042 --> 15:44.714
SOME DUDE'S PUKE IS GONNA
FLY IN YOUR FACE.

15:44.714 --> 15:47.417
TRAV, I AM SO SORRY.

15:47.417 --> 15:50.050
IT'S OKAY, DAD.
I FORGIVE YOU.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.983
AND I LOVE YOU,
AND WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEONE,

15:52.983 --> 15:55.585
YOU STEP IN WHEN
THEY NEED IT MOST.

15:55.585 --> 15:57.027
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:57.027 --> 16:00.130
GOING TO THE AMUSEMENT PARK,
FOR YOU

16:00.130 --> 16:03.593
AND FOR GRANDPAPPY COBB.

16:03.593 --> 16:05.165
SO TOUCHING.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.636
40 BUCKS SAYS HE HURLS.

16:10.140 --> 16:12.172
DID YOUR MOM PICK OUT
THAT OUTFIT FOR YOU?

16:12.172 --> 16:13.603
SHE'S AN IDIOT!

16:13.603 --> 16:16.006
SORRY. BUILT-UP SNARK.

16:16.006 --> 16:18.678
NICE GOATEE, STONE TEMPLE LOSER.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.750
ADULT BRACES? GOOD CALL, YEAH.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.253
HEY, GRANOLA,
IT'S CALLED DEODORANT.

16:23.253 --> 16:25.715
NICE SPRAY TAN, JERSEY SHORT.

16:25.715 --> 16:29.059
HEY, JACKASS,
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT...

16:29.059 --> 16:32.062
(chuckles)
HOW HANDSOME YOU ARE? WOW.

16:32.062 --> 16:33.423
REALLY, ELLIE?
GETTING YOUR SNARK FIX

16:33.423 --> 16:35.525
ON ALL THE INNOCENT PEOPLE
OF GULFHAVEN?

16:35.525 --> 16:37.027
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

16:37.027 --> 16:39.199
YES, I AM, ELLIE-SAN.

16:39.199 --> 16:43.033
NOW LET'S GET YOU DRESSED UP
LIKE A BUTT-FLOSSED FATSO.

16:43.033 --> 16:44.504
CONSIDERING I LOST

16:44.504 --> 16:47.337
AND I AM NO LONGER RESTRICTED
BY THIS BET,

16:47.337 --> 16:50.640
DO YOU THINK IT'S WISE
TO TAUNT ME?

16:50.640 --> 16:52.512
NO, MA'AM.

16:54.284 --> 16:56.116
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M GONNA SHAVE MY HEAD.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.048
(buzzing)
I'M GONNA DONATE MY HAIR
TO THE NEEDY.

16:58.048 --> 16:59.419
JULES, THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY

16:59.419 --> 17:00.690
COMING FROM A GUY
IN A CAPTAIN'S OUTFIT,

17:00.690 --> 17:03.253
BUT, UH, HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR MIND?

17:03.253 --> 17:04.494
I MEAN...

17:04.494 --> 17:06.326
(buzzing stops)
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:06.326 --> 17:09.259
WELL, EVER SINCE I LIED
TO SELL STUFF AT THE YARD SALE,

17:09.259 --> 17:10.600
SO MANY BAD THINGS
HAVE BEEN HAPPENING.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.132
I JUST FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN CURSED

17:12.132 --> 17:14.404
WITH SOME KIND OF BAD MOJO.

17:14.404 --> 17:17.267
"CURSED" AND "MOJO"? JULES,
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU.

17:17.267 --> 17:18.608
LAURIE MAYBE.

17:18.608 --> 17:20.270
OH, WELL,
SHE'S MY SPIRITUAL COACH.

17:20.270 --> 17:21.811
AND WE ARE ZEROING IN
ON THE PROBLEM.

17:21.811 --> 17:23.573
JULES, YOU REALLY CAN'T THINK
THAT THE UNIVERSE

17:23.573 --> 17:25.415
IS CONSPIRING AGAINST YOU.

17:25.415 --> 17:26.776
OF COURSE NOT. (chuckles)

17:26.776 --> 17:28.718
I MEAN, PROBABLY NOT.

17:28.718 --> 17:30.650
UNLESS IT DEFINITELY IS.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.552
MAYBE THIS KARMA THING
IS CRAZY,

17:32.552 --> 17:35.555
BUT BEFORE THE YARD SALE, I WAS
BLESSED WITH SUCH GOOD LUCK.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.557
YOU KNOW, MY DAD'S HEALTH
WAS GETTING BETTER.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.459
TRAVIS AND LAURIE
ARE DOING GREAT.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.361
I'M MARRIED TO
AN AMAZING MAN

17:41.361 --> 17:43.793
WHO USUALLY DOESN'T WALK AROUND
LOOKING LIKE A MASSIVE DORK.

17:43.793 --> 17:46.166
THIS IS A COOL JACKET,
AND I AM A COOL GUY.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.368
HOW CAN THIS COMBINATION
NOT BE WORKING?

17:48.368 --> 17:51.070
SORRY. BACK TO YOUR THING.
I DON'T KNOW.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.402
I JUST FEEL LIKE
THE IDEA OF KARMA

17:52.402 --> 17:54.774
GIVES ME CONTROL OVER
THE BAD THINGS.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.677
NO ONE CAN CONTROL WHAT
THE WORLD THROWS AT THEM, OKAY?

17:57.677 --> 17:59.579
BUT WHAT WE CAN CONTROL--

17:59.579 --> 18:01.351
EXCEPT IN PARTS OF INDIA--

18:01.351 --> 18:03.513
IS WHO WE CHOOSE TO BE WITH.

18:03.513 --> 18:05.515
SO WHEN LIFE HITS
A ROUGH PATCH,

18:05.515 --> 18:07.857
YOU DON'T REACH FOR
THE CLIPPERS.

18:07.857 --> 18:10.660
YOU LEAN ON
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.862
(Foy Vance)
в™Є A LONG WAY YET TO GO в™Є

18:12.862 --> 18:16.095
OH! EVEN IF THEY SMELL
LIKE MOTHBALLS?
WHAT?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.767
в™Є SO LET'S START OVER в™Є

18:17.767 --> 18:19.469
I LOVE YOU.

18:19.469 --> 18:21.731
I GUESS I DO HAVE
A GREAT SUPPORT TEAM, DON'T I?

18:21.731 --> 18:23.333
WE ALL DO.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.834
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE TRAVIS GOING
ON THAT ROLLER COASTER

18:24.834 --> 18:26.306
TO HELP BOBBY.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.838
TRAVIS IS GOING ON
A ROLLER COASTER?!

18:28.838 --> 18:30.540
в™Єв™Єв™Є

18:30.540 --> 18:33.183
OKAY, YOU CAN DO THIS.
IT'S JUST A ROLLER COASTER.

18:33.183 --> 18:34.614
NOBODY'S EVER DIED ON IT.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.417
(gasps) WHICH MEANS
IT'S LONG OVERDUE.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.119
TRAV! WAIT! DON'T DO THIS!

18:40.119 --> 18:41.651
OKAY, I WON'T!
NO, NO, NO.

18:41.651 --> 18:43.693
DON'T DO THIS BY YOURSELF.
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS TOGETHER.

18:43.693 --> 18:45.425
FOR GRANDPAPPY COBB.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.157
в™Є BUT I'M FEELING в™Є

18:47.157 --> 18:50.400
YOU'RE A GOOD KID, TRAV.
HE'D BE SO PROUD OF YOU.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.663
NOW LET'S RIDE THIS BAD BOY!
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

18:53.663 --> 18:55.305
(indistinct conversations)

18:55.305 --> 18:57.707
OKAY, NOW THAT OPERATOR'S,
LIKE, 12 YEARS OLD, MAN.

18:57.707 --> 18:59.869
THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE SAFE!

18:59.869 --> 19:01.271
в™Є COFFEE'S ON в™Є

19:01.271 --> 19:02.542
IT'S OKAY. I'VE GOT YOU.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.143
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.575
WE CAME TO SUPPORT YOU.

19:05.575 --> 19:07.146
в™Є COLOR IN YOUR EYES в™Є

19:07.146 --> 19:08.548
ALL OF YOU?

19:08.548 --> 19:09.749
THAT'S RIGHT, PASTY FACE.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.821
HEY, WATCH IT, WIDE LOAD.

19:11.821 --> 19:13.483
SUMO HIP CHECK!

19:13.483 --> 19:14.784
OHH!

19:14.784 --> 19:16.826
(thud)
OOH.

19:16.826 --> 19:19.589
THAT WAS SO HOT. (chuckles)

19:19.589 --> 19:21.691
EXCUSE ME. NO, WE GOTTA DO THIS
NOW OR IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

19:21.691 --> 19:23.233
HEY.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

19:23.233 --> 19:24.494
UM, EXCUSE ME.
I SAW YOU CUT THE LINE.

19:24.494 --> 19:26.466
SO, UH, GET TO THE BACK.
RIGHT NOW.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.737
WE'RE LOSING HIM.
WHOA, DAD!

19:27.737 --> 19:30.800
IT'S OKAY, YOUNG MAN.
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.402
OH. UM, CAPTAIN,
I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

19:32.402 --> 19:34.644
PLEASE, UM, HOP ON BOARD.
(chuckles)

19:34.644 --> 19:36.276
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:36.276 --> 19:38.308
(Jules) GREAT SAVE, CAPTAIN.

19:38.308 --> 19:40.380
THANKS. YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT
WORRIED ABOUT BAD KARMA?

19:40.380 --> 19:42.382
I MEAN, WE JUST GOT IN FRONT OF,
LIKE, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.314
NO, WE WERE JUST DOING IT
TO SUPPORT OUR FRIENDS.

19:44.314 --> 19:46.286
BESIDES, I DON'T REALLY
BELIEVE IN KARMA.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.717
GOOD.

19:47.717 --> 19:49.259
BUT MAYBE DON'T SAY THAT
RIGHT AS WE GET ON

19:49.259 --> 19:51.361
A DECADES-OLD CARNIVAL RIDE.

19:51.361 --> 19:52.722
ALL RIGHT, GRANDPAPPY COBB,

19:52.722 --> 19:54.664
LET'S GET YOU SCATTERED!
YEAH!

19:54.664 --> 19:57.797
IF BOBBY'S SCATTERING THE ASHES,
WHY IS HE IN THE FRONT?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.629
(gasps) BOBBY, WAIT!

19:59.629 --> 20:01.200
(camera shutter clicks)

20:01.200 --> 20:03.473
в™Єв™Єв™Є

20:05.575 --> 20:07.337
THANKS FOR COMING, EVERYONE.

20:07.337 --> 20:09.739
WE'VE MOURNED OUR LOSS,
AND NOW IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON.

20:09.739 --> 20:12.742
ALSO, I REALLY NEED TO WASH
GRANDPAPPY COBB OUT OF MY MOUTH.

20:12.742 --> 20:14.314
DITTO THAT.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.785
I'M AN ASHY MESS.

20:15.785 --> 20:17.387
OKAY, LET'S GET ON WITH IT.

20:17.387 --> 20:21.421
PLEASE WELCOME OUR NEWEST MEMBER
OF THE GANG...

20:21.421 --> 20:22.792
BIG SUE.

20:22.792 --> 20:24.624
AH, BIG SUE!
BIG SUE!

20:24.624 --> 20:26.356
OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT.

20:26.356 --> 20:28.458
DOES IT HAVE TO BE THAT BIG?
REALLY?

20:28.458 --> 20:30.500
I MEAN, EVENTUALLY, IT'S GONNA
JUST TUMBLE TO THE EARTH

20:30.500 --> 20:32.302
AND CRASH IN A STORM OF GLASS,

20:32.302 --> 20:34.334
WHICH I'M GONNA HAVE TO
CLEAN UP.

20:34.334 --> 20:38.237
OH. OKAY, REALLY, I'M--
I'M THE CRAZY ONE? OKAY.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.540
WE'LL MISS YOU, BIG TIPPI.

20:40.540 --> 20:50.550
в™Єв™Єв™Є
