00:12.303 --> 00:14.264
Yeah, who cares
if the frats won't let us in?

00:14.264 --> 00:16.224
We'll just throw our own party.
- Yeah!

00:16.224 --> 00:18.059
And now, we don't have
to wait in some long lines

00:18.059 --> 00:19.477
freezing our asses off,

00:19.477 --> 00:21.646
hoping some power-hungry
douchebags let us in.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.231
Yes, Bela.
Go off.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.483
Now, we get to be
the power-hungry douchebags.

00:25.483 --> 00:28.111
Can't wait to reject people.
- Oh.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.488
Oh, my God.
This looks amazing.

00:30.488 --> 00:33.408
Yeah, you guys killed this.
We brought more booze.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.326

Yeah.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.293
This is gonna be amazing.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.044
Okay, so now,
all we have to do

00:45.044 --> 00:47.172
is just sit back
and let the people come.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.428
I can't believe no one came.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.013
Honestly, I'm having fun.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.306
Should I put a podcast on?

00:56.306 --> 00:57.682
I just head a great one about

00:57.682 --> 00:59.893
the etymology
of the word etymology.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.145
Someone's here.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.313

someone start the music.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.481
- Yeah.
- Dance, dance!

01:06.399 --> 01:09.235

01:09.235 --> 01:10.653
Oh, it's Frude.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.322
- Are you here for the party?
- Sadly, no.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.241
Girls, I know you attempted
to throw a social event

01:15.241 --> 01:17.744
this evening and
it is clear no one came.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.870
There's still time.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.830
Mm, it is 1:30 in the morning

01:20.830 --> 01:23.500
and a good party
would be peaking right now.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.834
Damn, Frude.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.503
But just because
you don't have friends

01:26.503 --> 01:28.588
doesn't mean
your life doesn't have value.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.006
- Thanks?
- Mm?

01:30.006 --> 01:31.716
I would normally
confiscate your alcohol,

01:31.716 --> 01:35.929
but this situation is so sad,
you can keep it.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.181
And hey,

01:38.181 --> 01:40.016
make as much noise
as you like.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.184
No one else is home.

01:41.184 --> 01:44.103

03:08.730 --> 03:12.025
<i>The surfing turtles

<i>They're both so fun!</i>

03:16.487 --> 03:18.573
Damn.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.992
That was, like, great.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.619
How'd you get so good at sex?

03:22.619 --> 03:24.287
One summer in high school,

03:24.287 --> 03:27.457
I met this older woman
who showed me the ways of love.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.666
Shut up. Really?

03:28.666 --> 03:30.293
No. I just watch
a lot of porn.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.295
Oh.
Cool.

03:34.255 --> 03:37.467
Wait, seriously,
you're on a dating app already?

03:37.467 --> 03:38.843
What do you mean?

03:38.843 --> 03:40.386
I mean, I was
inside you 30 seconds ago.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.138
I thought we talked
about this already.

03:42.138 --> 03:43.306
Aren't we both allowed
to hook up with other people?

03:43.306 --> 03:44.807
Yeah, I just assumed

03:44.807 --> 03:46.392
we'd kind of tactfully look
for those hookups.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.478
Like, not while
we're lying naked together.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.146
Hey, what are you up to?
Want to hang out tonight?

03:50.146 --> 03:52.315
You've come over,
like, three nights in a row.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.150
I just love
spending time with you.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.526
Oh, this is 'cause

03:55.526 --> 03:57.695
you and your roommates
are banned from parties.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.155
Yes. It's horrible.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.531
I had to do homework
last night.

04:00.531 --> 04:01.741
I don't know what to do
with myself.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.284
Look, guys love flattery

04:03.284 --> 04:04.994
and I hesitate to tell you this

04:04.994 --> 04:07.705
'cause you are
pathologically overconfident,

04:07.705 --> 04:09.332
but you're cute.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.125
Thank you.
I know.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.460
So just beg them
to let you back in.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.045
Smart,
like how I begged you

04:14.045 --> 04:15.588
to keep your glasses on
during sex.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.340
I need to take them off
when I go down on you.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.092
They get foggy.
I can't see what I'm doing.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.516
I have got to get at least
a B on this Spanish final

04:26.516 --> 04:29.018
or my mom's gonna go
no bueno on my ass.

04:29.018 --> 04:31.896
See? This is why
I take easy classes.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.356
Next trimester,
I'm taking a class

04:33.356 --> 04:36.025
that's just called Textures.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.860
Mm.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.028
Hmm.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.446
Sweet mother
of Kristen Stewart,

04:40.446 --> 04:44.075
that is a smoking hot woman.
Mm!

04:44.075 --> 04:45.535
Do you know who that girl is?

04:45.535 --> 04:46.953
I know exactly who she is.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.496
She's hot, she works as Sips,

04:48.496 --> 04:50.456
and she just
touched your man's arm.

04:52.583 --> 04:53.876
I will be right back.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.044
It's crazy how
you can make that happen.

04:55.044 --> 04:56.212
You are catching on fast.

04:56.212 --> 04:57.630
Maybe you should
be training me.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.799
Oh, Whit, this is
our new coworker, Zoe.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.426
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Whitney.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.219
I live with Kimberly.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.138
Kimberly, yes.
Oh, my God, I love her.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.472
She reminds me
of my grandmother.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.142
Zoe just
fixed our register system

05:09.142 --> 05:10.727
so that it's all
automated to the iPad.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.228
Oh.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.397
Mostly so I could make
the minimum tip option 30%.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.566
She's like some
mad coder genius.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.110
How cool is that?
- That's cool.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.404
Oh, she also
jailbroke my iPhone.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.947

Like, dessert?

07:23.860 --> 07:25.862
Or a clipping
from a feminist magazine?

07:25.862 --> 07:29.031
No. Just you.
Arif will be there as well.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.032

What? No.
She's my professor.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.972
Okay, yeah,
but if she can financially aid

07:52.972 --> 07:56.267
that Syrian snack,
maybe she can help you too.

What are you two doing here?

08:21.500 --> 08:23.127
Yeah, what part of us
actively hating you

08:23.127 --> 08:25.087
did you not understand?

08:25.087 --> 08:26.756
Look, I hear you.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.842
On behalf of all our roommates,
we are here to apologize.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.219
What we did was wrong

08:31.219 --> 08:33.846
and we are
stupid fucking bitches.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.389
Hmm.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.141
You and your brother
should've been allowed to cheat

08:37.141 --> 08:38.893
as much as you want and
use those grades to get into

08:38.893 --> 08:40.144
grad schools you could've
never gotten into otherwise.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.437
Okay, what the hell?

08:41.437 --> 08:42.480
You're making us
sound even worse.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.940
Yeah, you kind of are.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.608
That apology sucked
and your hand was clammy.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.443
Well, you got to forgive us.
This is killing me.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.986
Without an active social life,
I'm having regular,

08:48.986 --> 08:50.404
monogamous sex with someone

08:50.404 --> 08:52.615
I only intended
to be a casual hookup.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.658
It's hell.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.117
Yeah, this isn't compelling

08:55.117 --> 08:56.827
and we've got bigger
things to worry about.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.120
Theta might lose their charter

08:58.120 --> 08:59.747
because of the stunt
you pulled.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.457
Look, if you want to get
Theta out of trouble,

09:01.457 --> 09:03.292
prove to the administration
that you're good guys.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.170
You know, throw a fundraiser
for something Essex cares about

09:06.170 --> 09:08.381
like climate change
or something.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.800
How? We can't throw parties
in the house anymore.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.343
They won't even let
my book club meet.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.552
I guess I'll just read
"The Secret History"

09:13.552 --> 09:15.304
and talk about it with no one.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.306
Well, why don't you let us
figure out where to throw it?

09:17.306 --> 09:20.351
Yeah, and if this works,
and I'm not sure it will

09:20.351 --> 09:21.811
because I have
no experience doing this,

09:21.811 --> 09:23.896
you let us back into parties.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.564
Okay, but I don't get
why anyone

09:25.564 --> 09:27.191
would go to
a Theta fundraiser.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.526
It's a good point.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.529
Damn, I am so money!

09:31.529 --> 09:34.699
<i>♪ Shake that thing ♪</i>

09:34.699 --> 09:37.702
Do you know what
"Magic Mike Live" is?

09:37.702 --> 09:40.329
- A strip show?
- It's not a strip show.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.498
It's a sex-positive,
female-forward,

09:42.498 --> 09:44.375
entertainment strip-tacular.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.460
It's also a fundraiser
for climate change.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.004
Yeah, those two things
don't mix.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.338
People aren't gonna pay
to watch

09:49.338 --> 09:51.007
these Theta guys
take their shirts off?

09:51.007 --> 09:52.508
They're already
never wearing shirts.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.927
This is different.
This is spectacle.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.929
I'm talking tear away pants,
body oil,

09:56.929 --> 09:58.681
happy trails,
both front and back.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.684
There won't be a dry, pardon
my French, panty in the house.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.227
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

10:03.227 --> 10:04.854
but I think
Bela might be right.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.023
I agree. I do think
people will pay for this.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.899
I know they will
and when this works,

10:08.899 --> 10:10.192
you all will be thanking me.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.569
Hopefully,
while holding my hair

10:11.569 --> 10:13.029
while I puke
into a frat's urinal.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.530
Why are you
fantasizing about that?

10:14.530 --> 10:16.782
Oh, who knows
where fantasies come from?

10:16.782 --> 10:19.035
I'm gonna go work
on a playlist of songs

10:19.035 --> 10:20.536
that's good to hump a floor to.

10:20.536 --> 10:21.912
Text me if you have any ideas.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.165
I'll be trying some out
in my room.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.709
Hey, so I met
your new coworker.

10:26.709 --> 10:27.877
Zoe?

10:27.877 --> 10:29.754
She is so smart and so funny.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.422
She saw how much
apple juice I drank

10:31.422 --> 10:33.549
and she started calling it
my usual.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.926
Like, that's your usual.
- That's good.

10:35.926 --> 10:38.137
So everyone likes her.

10:38.137 --> 10:42.224
Like, Lila, your boss, Canaan.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.476
Yeah. I mean, she's amazing.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.102
AOC even follows her
on Twitter.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.605
I mean, is that special?
AOC follows my mom too.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.065
Yeah, but your mom's
a senator.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.816
Zoe's just a student
and a former model.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.401
It's different.

10:52.401 --> 10:55.571
Wait. Are you--are you, like,
jealous of this girl?

10:55.571 --> 10:56.572
- No.
- Oh.

10:56.572 --> 10:57.990
No, no, I'm not jealous.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.410
She should be jealous
of how not jealous I am.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.290
You guys should join
Bela's comedy magazine thing

11:06.290 --> 11:08.793
'cause that is hilarious.

11:14.590 --> 11:18.094
Bela, why are there a bunch
of male thongs on your bed?

11:18.094 --> 11:20.846
Because I am jazzing up
some booty shorts

11:20.846 --> 11:22.681
for the Theta boys to dance in.

11:22.681 --> 11:25.768
They are sexy
and biodegradable.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.311
- Oh.
- Only if someone asks.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.604
They're not actually biodegradable.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.189
- Oh.
- Oh, fuck.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.066
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
- What happened?

11:32.066 --> 11:34.026
Oh, God. Did your mom
get assassinated?

11:34.026 --> 11:35.903
- What? No.
- Oh.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.822
No, I was on
that girl Zoe's Insta

11:37.822 --> 11:40.950
and I accidentally liked a pic.
Like, a super deep one.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.451
- How deep?
- June.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.245
- That's not bad.
- Of 2014.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.496
- Okay, that's bad.
- Whitney!

11:45.496 --> 11:46.580
This doesn't
have to be weird.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.124
What is the post?

11:48.124 --> 11:50.584
It says, "Miss you, Gam Gam,
today and every day."

11:50.584 --> 11:51.836
Oh, fuck me.

11:51.836 --> 11:52.920
I liked a picture
of her dead grandmother.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.213
What am I supposed to do?

11:54.213 --> 11:55.297
Just start liking
all her pics.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.632
It'll confuse her.

11:56.632 --> 11:57.925
No, no. That'll make it
so much worse.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.385
Can one of you
help me please?

11:59.385 --> 12:00.803
Okay, report her account
for terrorism

12:00.803 --> 12:02.304
and then maybe
they'll take it down.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.472
She's like a hot
Black Mark Zuckerberg.

12:03.472 --> 12:04.974
She's gonna figure that out.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.643
Okay, everybody, calm down.
I know what to do.

12:07.643 --> 12:10.604
Zoe will see that notification
and she will know that

12:10.604 --> 12:12.982
it's from you because your face
is on your profile pic

12:12.982 --> 12:14.692
and Whitney's
in your Insta name,

12:14.692 --> 12:16.986
but she won't know it's you
if you change those things.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.654
So make your account private,

12:18.654 --> 12:21.615
change your profile picture
to a stock image of a burrito,

12:21.615 --> 12:24.785
and make your account name
@ChipotleAbluqeurque.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.328
She'll think
you're a random like

12:26.328 --> 12:27.705
from a Chipotle promo account
in New Mexico.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.124
Holy shit.
That is wildly brilliant.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.459
It really is.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.752
That's like Zoe level smart.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.629
Could you not?

12:37.923 --> 12:41.135
<i>Professor Hennessey,
this dinner has been so fun.</i>

12:41.135 --> 12:42.636
<i>Can I help you
with those dishes?</i>

12:42.636 --> 12:44.388
Oh, don't worry about it.

12:44.388 --> 12:45.389
I have a dishwasher.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.016
His name is Craig.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.396
So I probably should say this
as I haven't posted

12:52.396 --> 12:54.648
the final trimester grades yet,
but you got an A.

12:54.648 --> 12:55.858
- I did?
- Yes.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.443
- Oh.
- One of two in the class.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.030
Professor Hennessey,
can I ask you something?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.323
Yes, of course. Anything.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.575
- I lost my scholarship.
- Mm-hmm.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.702
And I need someone
to cosign a loan for me

13:06.702 --> 13:08.287
so I can stay here.

13:08.287 --> 13:11.290
I hate to ask you, but my
parents can't know about this

13:11.290 --> 13:12.958
and I don't know
what else to do.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.752
All I need--
- Let me stop you...

13:14.752 --> 13:15.878
- Okay.
- For a second.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.171
Yeah.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.839
I see a lot of myself
in you, Kimberly,

13:18.839 --> 13:20.925
and I would never want to lose
a student like you.

13:20.925 --> 13:25.429
Just give me a minute
to think on it, okay?

13:25.429 --> 13:26.388
Okay.

13:29.433 --> 13:32.895
Yes! This dining hall
was born to be a strip club.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.146
Looking good, guys.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.981
Time to get fluffed
and stuffed.

13:35.981 --> 13:39.068
Let's make our climate
daddy proud.

13:39.068 --> 13:43.322
Okay, DJ, keep it peppy.
I want 80 humps per minute.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.575
Okay, Cody, work it.

13:46.575 --> 13:47.993
Get that chair pregnant.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.287
Bela, we've sold
so many tickets

13:50.287 --> 13:52.957
that my Venmo just froze.
God, this is incredible!

13:52.957 --> 13:55.084
I know. You know, I think
this might be my calling.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.752
It combines my two loves.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.754
Sexy, greasy men
and bossing people around.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.589
Okay, I got
to give you credit.

14:00.589 --> 14:03.717
I think this fundraiser could
really get our frat reinstated.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.928
It's my pleasure
and if you take any pictures

14:05.928 --> 14:07.763
in the dressing room,
my AirDrop's always on.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.975
Excuse me?
What on Earth is going on?

14:10.975 --> 14:13.894
Dean Miller?
Are you here to buy a ticket?

14:13.894 --> 14:15.312
To a strip show?

14:15.312 --> 14:18.315
Essex is a respected,
feminist institution,

14:18.315 --> 14:21.235
a cornerstone
of Vermont herstory.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.362
Whatever this is, it's over.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.072
Dean Miller,
if you let me explain,

14:25.072 --> 14:27.157
this is a legitimate
and tasteful event.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.285
Okay, I didn't spend
three decades marching

14:29.285 --> 14:31.495
in support of women's rights
to support that.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.956
Yo, he's making
his dick bounce!

14:33.956 --> 14:36.959
Okay, ma'am, we at Theta,
we're trying to prove

14:36.959 --> 14:38.877
that our bodies
aren't just for pleasure.

14:38.877 --> 14:40.588
They are also for service.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.424
I promise, if you could just
stay and watch my performance

14:43.424 --> 14:46.135
of "Thot Shit" by Megan
Thee Stallion, you'll agree.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.636
Yeah, that's not happening.

14:47.636 --> 14:51.181
The Vermont constitution
was ratified in this room.

14:51.181 --> 14:54.560
It's not where we gyrate
to "Thot Shit."

14:54.560 --> 14:56.437
Keep her here
till I get back.

14:56.437 --> 14:59.982
Dean Miller, can I tell you
a long story about

14:59.982 --> 15:02.610
why the environment
is so important to me?

15:02.610 --> 15:05.279
<i>♪ I wanna feel like
yeah, yeah, yeah ♪</i>

15:05.279 --> 15:08.157
<i>♪ I-I wanna feel like ♪</i>

15:08.157 --> 15:09.742
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah
I-I wanna ♪</i>

15:09.742 --> 15:11.410
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah ♪</i>

15:11.410 --> 15:13.954
<i>♪ Feel like that
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪</i>

15:15.914 --> 15:17.499
Hi. I'm Bela.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.835
I live next door to you
and I really need your help.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.420
Okay.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.255
Also, can I have some water?
I ran all the way here.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.717
<i>How are you liking Essex,
Arif?</i>

15:26.717 --> 15:28.218
It's very nice.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.429
The professor and her husband
have been very generous.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.680
Arif, forget about college.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.973
You can make a killing modeling.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.183
Your bone structure is sick.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.060
Aw, thanks, Lila.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.353
You're very sick too.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.730
- Kimberly.
- Yeah.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.190
I thought about
what you asked me.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.691
Uh-huh.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.026
And if it means keeping
a student like you at Essex,

15:44.026 --> 15:45.778
I would be happy
to cosign for you.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.364
Seriously?
Oh, thank you.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.616
Thank you so much.
Oh!

15:50.616 --> 15:52.326
My pleasure.

15:52.326 --> 15:55.913
All right, gang, I'm gonna
call it a night for myself,

15:55.913 --> 15:57.373
but please stay and enjoy.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.584
Okay.
Thank you.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.753
- You having a good time?
- Yeah, great.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.547
Dinner was awesome
and your wife is the best.

16:05.547 --> 16:08.300
She's so smart and impressive.
- Yeah, she really is.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.052
Although, she would kill me
if I told you

16:10.052 --> 16:12.012
stories about her from college.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.390
Maybe after one more drink.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.891
I love the life you two have.

16:15.891 --> 16:19.186
Two smart, cool, academics
in this cute house

16:19.186 --> 16:21.313
with all your books
and worldly knickknacks.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.731
It's like a dream.

16:22.731 --> 16:26.235
I can see why
Elizabeth likes you so much.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.697
We should fuck sometime.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.410
As a climate refugee,
the fact that these students

16:34.410 --> 16:36.662
would work so hard to raise
money for the environment,

16:36.662 --> 16:38.956
it almost makes me forget
the day that I lost

16:38.956 --> 16:41.959
two close friends in
a "Wizard of Oz"-style tornado.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.502
You should be proud
of the campus community

16:43.502 --> 16:44.753
that you've created here.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.755
Also, Theta raised
$11,000 tonight.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.549
You know, I don't care--
oh, my God, what?

16:48.549 --> 16:52.094
$11,000?
- Yup.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.887
Okay.
You can do your show.

16:53.887 --> 16:57.099
But lights out by midnight
and no full nudity.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.434
Don't worry, Dean.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.768
All penises will remain
safely stowed.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.603
Okay.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.105
Holy shit.
That actually worked.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.774
- Thanks, new hot friend.
- Yeah, I got you.

17:05.774 --> 17:07.776
Hey, I'm gonna go back
to my room because

17:07.776 --> 17:09.403
I'm expecting a girl in,
like, five minutes,

17:09.403 --> 17:12.072
but have fun with this.

17:12.072 --> 17:13.782
All right, everyone.
It's go time.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.409
Line up for
your good luck butt slap.

17:17.745 --> 17:20.873
Hello, Essex.
How is everyone doing tonight?

17:22.875 --> 17:25.002
It's about to get real heated
up in this room

17:25.002 --> 17:27.671
and it's not because
of carbon emissions.

17:27.671 --> 17:31.258
Give it up for

17:51.111 --> 17:52.321

- You got it?

17:52.321 --> 17:53.655
Damn. You blinked in this one

17:53.655 --> 17:55.240
and somehow
you still look fine.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.159
- Thank you.
- It's going on the main.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.495
Oh, okay.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.581
Wait. What's up?
I can't find your profile.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.917
Oh, yeah. Something weird
must've happened.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.168
Oh, here. Let me see.
I can fix it.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.003
No, no. It's good.
I can--

18:08.003 --> 18:10.506
- Wait. What the--
- Don't--

18:10.506 --> 18:12.674
Whit, did you
rename your account

18:12.674 --> 18:14.510
to @ChipotleAlbuquerque?

18:14.510 --> 18:16.428
There's wraps and burritos
and shit.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.721
Why would you do that?

18:17.721 --> 18:19.014
Okay, listen.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.265
It's so stupid.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.601
So I was, you know,
lightly perusing

18:22.601 --> 18:24.603
your coworker Zoe's profile
and I accidentally liked

18:24.603 --> 18:26.021
a picture of her dead grandma,

18:26.021 --> 18:28.398
so Bela changed my profile
to a Chipotle.

18:28.398 --> 18:31.819
I understood, like,
half of that sentence.

18:31.819 --> 18:37.074
I guess I was jealous of
how impressed you are with Zoe

18:37.074 --> 18:38.659
and how smart she is.

18:38.659 --> 18:43.247
And it made me feel--
I don't know, unimpressive.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.208
You have nothing
to be jealous about.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.377
You're a dream girl.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.212
And I'm not even
into Zoe like that.

18:50.212 --> 18:53.382
Like--like at all.

18:53.382 --> 18:57.094
Also, I was right behind you

18:57.094 --> 18:58.846
at Omega Pi
when you told your friend

18:58.846 --> 19:01.557
I'm a loser
who doesn't have a thing.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.309
Well, I definitely
didn't say you were a loser.

19:04.309 --> 19:07.437
But I'm sorry for saying
anything behind your back.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.440
That was wrong.
- Thanks.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.234
But do I think you have
too much time on your hands?

19:12.234 --> 19:15.279
I mean, seems like it, right?
- Okay, okay, sure.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.281
Maybe I could find
more constructive ways

19:17.281 --> 19:19.241
to use my time, yes.
- Maybe, maybe.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.493
But for now,
I'm just gonna focus

19:21.493 --> 19:23.161
on the dream girl part
of all of this.

19:23.161 --> 19:24.413
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That was cute. That was good.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.164
As you should.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.551
Was I nuts to dump her?

19:37.551 --> 19:39.303
She's, like, one of
the hottest girls on campus.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.763
Sure,
but given all the texts

19:41.763 --> 19:43.223
I've gotten
about you this week,

19:43.223 --> 19:44.766
I'm pretty sure
you're one of the hottest

19:44.766 --> 19:46.727
queer girls on campus now too.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.437
What? Really?

19:48.437 --> 19:50.439
Uh, to be clear,
you're not my type.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.566
I'm into gingers.
I'd die for Shiv Roy.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.819
But you don't notice the way
they all look at you?

19:57.738 --> 19:59.281
Shit,
they used to do that for me.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.783
Look, sis is
practically drooling.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.911
Hmm.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.329

20:13.211 --> 20:14.671
- Hey!
- Hey.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.423
This is amazing.

20:16.423 --> 20:19.426
It somehow manages to be both
erotic and thought-provoking.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.553
Yeah, who said
you can't save polar bears

20:21.553 --> 20:23.680
and admire a dude's V muscles
at the same time?

20:23.680 --> 20:26.475
Hey, how was the dinner party?

20:26.475 --> 20:27.851
Good, I guess.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.519
My professor said
she'd cosign my loan.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.313
- Yes!
- Oh, my God, that's so great.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.482
Yeah, but then
I was talking to her husband

20:33.482 --> 20:36.944
and he said,
"We should fuck sometime."

20:36.944 --> 20:37.986
- What?
- Huh?

20:37.986 --> 20:39.821
Oh, that's so gross.

20:39.821 --> 20:41.073
What did you tell him?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.491
Oh, don't worry.
I shut it down.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.868
Okay, but what did
you say exactly?

20:44.868 --> 20:47.329
I think I said cool,
but in a way

20:47.329 --> 20:49.331
that clearly communicated
that meant not cool.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.167
Like, not cool, man.
Not cool.

20:52.167 --> 20:55.295
But did you say the not part
or just the cool part?

20:55.295 --> 20:56.838
- Just cool.
- Mm.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.507
Kimberly, cool means cool.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.175
You told him yes.
- No, I didn't.

21:00.175 --> 21:01.885
Okay, say it to me
like you said it in the moment.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.512
We should fuck sometime.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.930
Cool.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.057
Yeah, so you just
told this man

21:07.057 --> 21:08.684
that you want
to have sex with him.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.603
Yeah, I hear that now.

Kimberly,
I'm glad you're here.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.119
I brought this to say
thanks for the lovely dinner

22:09.119 --> 22:11.496
and you know, the other thing.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.665
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.042
I'm so sorry, Kimberly,

22:15.042 --> 22:19.171
but I cannot
cosign your loan for you.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.714
Oh, my God.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.424
Professor Hennessey,
I am so sorry.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.135
I never would've done anything
sexual with your husband.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.928
I should've said no
in the moment,

22:26.928 --> 22:28.638
but I was confused.
It was just an--

22:28.638 --> 22:30.390
What are you talking about?

22:31.516 --> 22:33.101
What were <i>you</i> talking about?

22:33.101 --> 22:35.103
My accountant was worried
that cosigning a loan

22:35.103 --> 22:37.564
would affect my credit score
too much.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.776
Did my husband
make a pass at you?

22:40.776 --> 22:42.861
You know, I think

22:42.861 --> 22:45.072
I just might've misunderstood
what he said.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.365
What did he say?

22:47.365 --> 22:50.952
I think he said
something like,

22:50.952 --> 22:52.829
"We should fuck sometime."

22:54.039 --> 22:56.041
I am so sorry, Professor.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.834
No.
You've done nothing wrong.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.879
You are not
my unemployed husband

23:00.879 --> 23:04.508
who is trying to fuck a coed
for not the first time.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.009
Excuse me.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.511
Craig, hi.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.472
It's your wife,
you piece of shit.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.557
Have you seen yourself
in the mirror?

23:12.557 --> 23:13.934
I'm just gonna
leave the plant.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.268
Seriously?

23:15.268 --> 23:17.729
You hit on another student?
That's it.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.272
I'm calling your sister
to pick you up.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.733
Pack your stuff.
You're Nancy's problem now.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.735
No, you can't
get your guitars later.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.821
Take them now!

23:25.821 --> 23:27.197
