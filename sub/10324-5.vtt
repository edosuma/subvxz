<i>My name is Earl.</i>

00:04.771 --> 00:09.435
<i>[Earl Narrating] They say in Camden County</i>
<i>a crime is committed every seven minutes.</i>

00:09.542 --> 00:13.876
<i>Unfortunately forJoy, it had been</i>
<i>six minutes and 57 seconds.</i>

00:15.782 --> 00:17.750
The hell? This ain't a bus.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.376
You're getting carjacked.
Get out.

00:20.487 --> 00:25.015
Fine. But carjackin' a red, white and blue Brat
is like spittin' on the American flag.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.888
Least let me get my nuggets.

00:26.993 --> 00:29.962
Oh, snap!
My hand snapped!

00:31.664 --> 00:34.064
Hey, Earl, have you heard
that if you can tear...

00:34.167 --> 00:37.295
the label off your beer in one piece,
it means you're not a virgin?

00:37.404 --> 00:40.931
- Willie the mailman was talkin' about it.
- I hadn't heard that.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.878
Guess it's true.

00:47.881 --> 00:51.112
- What? I've had sex, you stupid beer!
- <i>[Tires Screeching]</i>

[Grunts]

01:01.528 --> 01:03.621
Damn it.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.994
That was the best stunt
I've seen since SweetJohnny.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.535
SweetJohnny.

01:10.637 --> 01:12.935
<i>[Earl Narrating] SweetJohnny was</i>
<i>number 7 on my list...</i>

<i>and one of the things</i>
<i>I felt the worst about.</i>

01:15.542 --> 01:19.239
<i>SweetJohnny got his name because</i>
<i>he was the sweetest guy anyone knew.</i>

01:19.345 --> 01:23.111
<i>But also because he was a stuntman</i>
<i>and did some sweet stunts.</i>

01:23.216 --> 01:26.083
[Grunts]

01:26.186 --> 01:28.313
<i>His stunts were impressive...</i>

01:28.421 --> 01:31.822
<i>but I was even more impressed</i>
<i>with his girlfriend, Sheila.</i>

01:33.493 --> 01:36.621
So, the doctor says you're gonna
be laid up for a couple days, huh?

01:36.729 --> 01:39.129
Yeah, but it was worth it.

01:39.232 --> 01:44.636
'Cause that stunt SweetJohnny
just pulled off was swe-e-et! [Coughs]

01:44.737 --> 01:47.205
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

01:47.307 --> 01:49.434
Well, hang in there, buddy.

01:51.211 --> 01:55.307
<i>[Earl Narrating] So this time when Johnny</i>
<i>got hurt, I decided to make my move.</i>

02:02.388 --> 02:06.222
Well, there's a back porch
I could spend an afternoon on.

02:06.326 --> 02:11.025
Yeah. Nice, ain't it? Reach out
and grab a slice of that butt-cake.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.156
- [Imitates Honking]
- [Laughs]

02:15.902 --> 02:18.894
<i>[Earl Narrating] I knew if I wanted</i>
<i>to keep foolin'around with Sheila...</i>

02:19.005 --> 02:22.236
<i>I had to keepJohnny out of the way,</i>
<i>so I came up with a plan.</i>

02:22.342 --> 02:25.869
- The Doomsday Chair, huh?
- Yep. Saw it as a kid on <i>That's Incredible.</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:30.177
You sit on the chair. When the seat blows up,
it throws you 20 feet in the air.

02:30.283 --> 02:35.311
But I was thinkin', you make the whole chair
out ofT.N.T., you'll go even higher.

02:35.421 --> 02:37.912
Yeah.
Forty feet in the air.

02:38.024 --> 02:40.891
SweetJohnny's gonna fly!
Whoo!

02:40.994 --> 02:44.896
<i>[Earl Narrating] I knew I was doin'wrong, but</i>
<i>a great heinie can make a man do crazy things.</i>

02:44.998 --> 02:49.458
- SweetJohnny!
- <i>Or make a man make a man do crazy things.</i>

02:57.777 --> 03:01.577
- Is that it?
- <i>[Girl] Oh, no!</i>

03:01.681 --> 03:03.911
<i>[Bystanders Chattering]</i>

03:04.017 --> 03:06.918
<i>[Earl Narrating] It didn't take me long</i>
<i>to realize the worseJohnny got hurt...</i>

03:07.020 --> 03:09.818
<i>the more time I got</i>
<i>in his van with Sheila.</i>

03:09.923 --> 03:13.484
<i>I don't remember how many stunts</i>
<i>I convinced him to do, but it was a lot.</i>

- <i># Love scars #</i>

- I can't do this anymore.

03:38.418 --> 03:41.819

- Yeah. This is some sick stuff.

You want to come?

04:08.514 --> 04:11.608
No, you go ahead.
Drop me off at the Crab Shack.

04:11.718 --> 04:15.017
I'm gonna get another beer
and prove to it I'm not a virgin.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.783
By doin' the label thing,
not puttin' my wiener in it.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.654
Just want to be clear.

04:36.576 --> 04:39.010
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>I hadn't heard anything aboutJohnny for a while...</i>

04:41.214 --> 04:43.978

<i>in the same house.</i>

04:44.083 --> 04:45.675
Hey, SweetJohnny.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.556
Earl Hickey! Wassup?

04:50.657 --> 04:52.591

04:52.692 --> 04:55.160
Wassup... with you?

04:55.261 --> 04:57.627
Oh, nothin'.
I'm just preparin' for a stunt.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.062
I'm gonna attach this chair
to two weather balloons...

05:00.166 --> 05:03.829
float as high as the planes fly,
high-five God...

05:03.936 --> 05:06.905
then jump off, use this parachute
to float sweetly back down to Earth.

05:07.006 --> 05:10.032
SweetJohnny!
[Chuckles]

05:10.143 --> 05:14.671
Look, Johnny, uh, I came here
to confess something.

05:14.781 --> 05:18.308
All that time I was convincing you
to do crazy stunts...

05:18.418 --> 05:22.320
I was doin' it to get you hurt
so I could sleep with Sheila.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.390
You slept with Sheila?

05:26.092 --> 05:29.755
Why would you do that?
Why-Why would she do that?

05:29.862 --> 05:34.492
She's the love of my life.
I thought you were my friend.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.661
L-l-I am, and l-I feel really bad
and want to make it up to you.

05:38.771 --> 05:41.604
You son of a bitch!

05:41.708 --> 05:44.370
[Screams]
Johnny, just give me a chance, man!

05:44.477 --> 05:46.411
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>I have a rule of thumb with the list.</i>

05:46.512 --> 05:50.243
<i>If someone pulls a weapon,</i>
<i>I give 'em time to cool off.</i>

05:53.453 --> 05:57.685
Baby, are these socks thicker
than my regular socks? I feel taller.

05:57.790 --> 06:01.248
- Where did you get a gun?
- At that Indian dude's garage sale.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.296
Got you a tank top too.
It says "Whitey Off the Rez"...

06:04.397 --> 06:06.888
but I figured since you're black,
you could get away with it.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.763
You know how I feel about guns.
No good can come from having one.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.235
Yeah? Well, if I had this yesterday,
we'd still have our car...

06:12.338 --> 06:15.569
and you wouldn't be goin'
to work ridin' bitch on Fernando's bicycle.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.939
No, if you had that yesterday,
there would have been a shoot-out.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.569
The inside of the Brat would've looked
like someone turned on a blender.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.648
You're steppin' on
my First Amendment rights.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.210
Freedom of speech

louder than this.

06:41.100 --> 06:45.469
Just checkin' to see if you've cooled down
since I was here yesterday.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.300
Yesterday?

06:47.407 --> 06:50.604
Yesterday I was in Nathanville with Sheila
pickin' up helium for my next big stunt.

06:50.710 --> 06:54.271
Oh, you're gonna love this. I'm gonna
attach this chair to some weather balloons...

06:54.380 --> 06:58.111
float up to where the planes fly,
high-five God...

06:58.217 --> 06:59.809
then jump back down
with this parachute-

06:59.919 --> 07:02.945
H-Hold on. I feel like
I caught that French disease...

07:03.055 --> 07:06.286
that makes things
happen to you twice.

07:06.392 --> 07:11.125
You don't remember me, uh, comin' by yesterday
and tellin' you I slept with Sheila?

07:11.230 --> 07:14.290
You-You slept with Sheila?

07:14.400 --> 07:16.527
Why would you do that?

07:16.636 --> 07:18.866
Why-Why would she do that?

07:18.971 --> 07:22.702
She's the love of my life.

<i>unpredictable, but now hejust seemed weird.</i>

<i>I tracked down Sheila...</i>

07:39.258 --> 07:42.819

Sheila? That you?

07:44.730 --> 07:48.393
Earl Hickey? I haven't
seen you for years! Hold on.

07:48.501 --> 07:52.301
I'll be right there.

07:52.405 --> 07:56.239
Oh, damn people.
Parkin' too close together.

07:59.779 --> 08:03.977
Oh, yeah. Baby got a little
bigger downstairs.

08:04.083 --> 08:08.816
But she still remembers you. You want to give it
a little squeeze for old time's sake?

08:12.225 --> 08:14.216
- [Weakly Imitates Honking]
- [Laughs]

08:14.327 --> 08:16.261
So what you doin'
in Mount Trace?

08:16.362 --> 08:18.330
Actually, I was, uh,
lookin' for you.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.525
I need to ask you somethin'
about SweetJohnny.

08:21.634 --> 08:25.502
I talked to him yesterday,
and he seemed kinda "forget-y."

08:25.605 --> 08:29.439
Oh, you don't know about the accident?
About the brain damage?

08:29.542 --> 08:32.807
<i>[Earl Narrating] Turns out even though</i>
<i>I'd putJohnny in danger a bunch of times...</i>

08:32.912 --> 08:36.348
<i>it was somethin'he did on his own</i>
<i>that ended up hurtin'him permanently.</i>

08:36.449 --> 08:38.940
Whoa!

08:39.051 --> 08:41.713
He hurt his brain so bad,
he can't make new memories.

08:41.821 --> 08:45.757
Whenever he falls asleep, he wakes up
thinkin' it is the day before his big stunt.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.883
He's got no idea
it's 10 years later?

08:47.994 --> 08:50.189
Mm-mmm.
He never leaves the house.

08:50.296 --> 08:53.322
He just goes to that garage
and works on that chair.

08:53.432 --> 08:55.923
I stayed with him
for a couple of years.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.799
But he got hurt the summer that
song "La Vida Loca" was big.

08:58.905 --> 09:02.864
If I heard him sing it one more time,
I was gonna drown him in the tub.

09:02.975 --> 09:07.207
I know what that's like.
Randy got really into that song for a while.

09:07.313 --> 09:09.577
It's the only time
I ever spanked him.

09:09.682 --> 09:13.948
I guess that explains why he didn't remember
me tellin' him about us sleepin' together.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.078
What the hell did you do that for?

09:16.188 --> 09:20.682
- Because it was a bad thing,
and I need to make up for it.
- Earl, sure we did wrong.

09:20.793 --> 09:24.285
But the way that I look at it, we got
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

09:24.397 --> 09:28.390
Oh, nice. Someone just parked
illegal cross the street. Be right back.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.767
[Car Alarm Wailing]

09:37.710 --> 09:39.610
I'm ignoring you, Darnell.

All I see is Charlie Brown fallin' while
that bitch pulls the football away again.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.816
Tell you what. If Chuck was packin',
people would stop messin' with him.

09:49.355 --> 09:51.823
I don't get it.
I'm not a virgin.

09:51.924 --> 09:56.122
Does sex not count with daytime
hookers, illegal aliens or 60-year-olds?

09:56.228 --> 09:59.527
I don't know how I'm gonna cross Johnny
off my list in one day.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.862
He's so pissed when
I tell him what I did...

10:01.968 --> 10:04.596
I can't even get to the apologizing
and making it up to him part.

10:04.704 --> 10:09.164
[Grunts] There's another staple.
That makes six.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.005
I don't know why you just don't skip him
and go to another item.

It's not like you're gonna live long enough
to actually finish that list anyway.

10:15.848 --> 10:18.976
Wrong. Earl promised me
he'd live forever.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.985
I'm gonna finish the list.

10:21.087 --> 10:25.217
Besides, once I start thinkin' about somethin',
I need to cross it off so I can forget about it.

<i>but to giveJohnny another try.</i>

- SweetJohnny?

11:00.459 --> 11:05.055
- Earl Hickey. Wassup?
- I slept with Sheila and made
you do dangerous stunts...

11:05.164 --> 11:07.530
so you'd get hurt
and I could bang her in your van.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.328

- I'm goin' to talk to Sheila.

11:32.558 --> 11:35.721
Hold on! That-That's not a good idea.
There's somethin' you don't know.

11:35.828 --> 11:41.266
See, you got this brain injury. When you go to
sleep, you wake up thinkin' it's the same day.

11:41.367 --> 11:45.701
- You've been doin' it for 10 years.
- Ten years? That's crazy.

I don't know what kind of trick
you're tryin' to pull on SweetJohnny...

did you bring him here for?

11:59.819 --> 12:01.446
Sorry, but he wanted to see you.

You idiot. He is not gonna remember
any of this in the mornin'.

Baby, tell me you didn't
cheat on SweetJohnny.

12:08.094 --> 12:11.063
Sweetness, there's nothin'
for you to get upset about.

12:11.163 --> 12:14.758
<i>Let's just get you back home</i>
<i>so you can get ready for your big-</i>

12:14.867 --> 12:17.631
Ass! Oh, God!

12:17.737 --> 12:19.637
What happened to your ass?

12:19.739 --> 12:23.266
- You know I got that lazy thyroid.
- But it's huge.

12:23.375 --> 12:28.005
It's like 10 years of
ass growth since yesterday.

12:28.114 --> 12:32.175
Oh, God, it's true!
It is 10 years later.

12:32.284 --> 12:35.151
<i>Oh, why?</i>

12:35.254 --> 12:37.518
[Screams, Grunts]

12:39.525 --> 12:44.224
So now you see my problem. I gotta make this up
to you in one day, before you go to sleep.

12:44.330 --> 12:49.131
So if we could just talk-
Johnny! Wait.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.202
Johnny, what do ya got there?

12:55.307 --> 12:58.299
Is that generic nighttime sniffling,
sneezing, coughing, aching, fever...

12:58.410 --> 13:00.378
the-best-sleep-you-ever-got-
with-a-cold medicine?

13:00.479 --> 13:03.971
<i>Johnny, don't do it! Don't go to sleep!</i>
<i>You'll forget everything!</i>

13:06.051 --> 13:08.713
That's the point, Earl.
I just want this day to end.

13:17.096 --> 13:20.896
- Darnell, have you seen my gun?
- Maybe the boys brought it to school.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.492
They mentioned somethin'
about bein' alienated and disillusioned.

13:24.603 --> 13:28.198
Are you tryin' to make some kind of point?
You know I don't like points, Darnell.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.775
I'm just sayin',
it's a shame you lost it.

13:30.876 --> 13:33.970
Today, the cops are havin'
that Guns For Hams exchange.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.748
Damn you! How am I supposed to protect
my family with a honey-glaze ham?

13:43.856 --> 13:46.290
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>The next day, I got back to work on Johnny.</i>

13:46.392 --> 13:50.590
<i>But since I knew what I was dealin'with,</i>
<i>I was able to get things done a little faster.</i>

13:50.696 --> 13:52.664
Earl Hickey. Wassup?

13:52.765 --> 13:55.427
- <i>I told him what I had done.</i>
- I thought you were my friend.

13:55.534 --> 13:59.026
<i>I let him work out his rage.</i>
<i>I told him about his brain problems.</i>

13:59.138 --> 14:01.436
This is crazy.
I'm gonna go talk to Sheila.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.941
- <i>Took him to see Sheila.</i>
- Sheila, tell me all this isn't true.

14:05.044 --> 14:08.502
- Oh, hell, not again.
- Oh, my God!

14:08.614 --> 14:12.175
- I'm really enjoying this, Earl.
- No get-out-of-jail-free cards.

14:12.284 --> 14:16.414
<i>[Earl Narrating] And I took him home.</i>
<i>But this time, I came prepared.</i>

14:19.592 --> 14:21.527
- Get away from me, you devil!
- Calm down, Johnny.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.721
- Get away from me, you devil!
- Calm down, Johnny.

14:22.828 --> 14:25.092
I'm gonna get you through this.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.688
<i>Eventually, I discovered</i>
<i>all Johnny needed were some kind words...</i>

14:27.800 --> 14:29.893
<i>once sung by</i>
<i>a handsome Cuban man.</i>

14:30.002 --> 14:32.903
<i>[Earl]</i>
<i>#Upside, inside out #</i>

14:33.005 --> 14:35.599
# Livin' <i>la vida loca</i> #

14:35.708 --> 14:39.144
# She'll push and pull you out #

14:39.245 --> 14:42.908
# Her skin's the color of mocha #

14:43.015 --> 14:47.315
# Livin' <i>la vida loca</i> ##

14:47.419 --> 14:49.114
Feelin' better, buddy?

14:49.221 --> 14:52.713
So it's just like that movie
<i>Groundhog Day</i> here.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.692
But instead of Andie MacDowell,
I got a cheatin' ex-girlfriend...

14:55.794 --> 14:58.126
with a big, fat dumper...

14:58.230 --> 15:01.495
and I never get to do my stunt.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.625
Afraid so.

15:05.738 --> 15:09.265
I guess than that's what
you can do for me, Earl.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.037
You can help me
do that BASE jump.

15:12.144 --> 15:14.044
Really?

15:14.146 --> 15:16.614
Do you think we could
pull it off right now?

15:16.715 --> 15:19.548
'Cause we kinda
need to do it today.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.382
I got everything ready out back.

15:22.488 --> 15:27.289
Apparently I've double-checked
it all 3,654 times.

15:27.393 --> 15:29.418
All right then. Let's jump!

15:29.528 --> 15:32.520
I'm gonna call the Crab Shack
and tell people you're doin' a stunt.

15:32.631 --> 15:35.862
Everybody's gonna be leavin' soon anyway
'cause Happy Half-Hour's almost over.

15:35.968 --> 15:38.698
This is great.
Give me a "SweetJohnny."

15:38.804 --> 15:41.136
[Snoring]

15:41.240 --> 15:43.640
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>So we went through it one last time.</i>

<i>#I'll tell you why ##</i>

15:58.824 --> 16:00.724
Look alive.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.920
<i>[Earl Narrating] At last, the stuntJohnny had</i>
<i>waited 10 years to do was ready.</i>

16:04.029 --> 16:07.487
Greetings, people of Camden
and what's left of the SweetJohnny Fan Club.

16:07.599 --> 16:09.863
- Whoo!
- [People Cheering]

16:09.969 --> 16:12.199
I love you, Johnny! Whoo!

16:12.304 --> 16:15.671
Thanks, Paul.
[Clears Throat]

16:15.774 --> 16:20.404
Well, I'm gonna take this chair, and
I'm gonna fly, and then I'm gonna jump off.

16:20.512 --> 16:23.913
And if, uh,
Lady Gravity does her job...

16:24.016 --> 16:26.211
you're gonna see a stunt
that you'll never forget.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.912
I'll never forget <i>you,</i> Johnny!

16:29.021 --> 16:31.854
- Whoo! [Laughs]
- <i>Thanks again, Paul.</i>

16:31.957 --> 16:35.723
Just dial it down a notch, bro.
All right.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.023
- SweetJohnny!
- <i>[Earl Narrating] I felt good.</i>

16:38.130 --> 16:41.327
<i>I was only a few minutes from bein'able</i>
<i>to cross SweetJohnny off my list...</i>

16:41.433 --> 16:44.925
<i>and put what I had done to him</i>
<i>behind me forever.</i>

16:45.037 --> 16:48.029
<i>[Earl]</i>
<i>What the-</i>

16:49.074 --> 16:52.237
Johnny!
Forgot your parachute.

16:53.545 --> 16:56.036
- <i>What the hell are you doin'?</i>
- Endin' it.

16:56.148 --> 16:59.083
If this is my life and that's Sheila's ass,
I don't want to go on.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.550
You-You can't kill yourself.

17:01.653 --> 17:04.213
Watch me. SweetJohnny!

17:04.323 --> 17:07.918
<i>Wait, wait. Johnny!</i>
<i>What are you doin'? Help!</i>

17:08.027 --> 17:10.791
- Let go!
- SweetJohnny, what are you doin'?

17:12.898 --> 17:15.526
Help! Somebody, get me down!

Get me down! Help!

17:19.838 --> 17:24.104
Oh, my God! I did it!

17:32.351 --> 17:36.048
If I still had my gun, I could shoot out
a balloon and save those idiots.

17:36.155 --> 17:38.521
- Joy, now's not the time.
- You still can't admit that sometime, somewhere...

17:38.624 --> 17:40.592
there's a good reason
to have a gun, can you?

17:40.692 --> 17:42.455
- Joy-
- Admit it, Darnell.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.689
Yes, I admit it. When two men are floating away
in a lawn chair tied to big balloons...

17:45.798 --> 17:49.063
and one of them has left his parachute behind,
that might be an okay time to have a gun.

17:49.168 --> 17:51.102
Thank you.

- Is anybody dead?
- He's knocked out, but breathing.

18:07.753 --> 18:11.086
Well, Darnell,
looks like the gun saved the day.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.421

Well, thanks, Earl. But there's no reason
for bein' sorry for likin' SweetJohnny.

SweetJohnny likes you too.
Hey, you mind helpin' me out?
