00:01.435 --> 00:04.705
NARRATOR: Ah, friends, our Jane
has been through so much.

00:04.738 --> 00:07.675
She got married to Michael,
but then he died.

00:07.708 --> 00:10.444
And so she wrote a book
about their love story,

00:10.478 --> 00:11.779
and it was
going to be published.

00:11.812 --> 00:12.913
So, great news there.

00:12.946 --> 00:15.416
Plus, she reconnected
with her very first love,

00:15.449 --> 00:16.417
Adam.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.386
Less happy? Our Rafael.

00:18.419 --> 00:19.687
After he lost all his money

00:19.720 --> 00:22.123
and was kicked out
of the hotel,

00:22.156 --> 00:24.092
well, he hit a real low point.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.194
I just want to step back.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.064
(grunts)

00:30.098 --> 00:31.632
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Luckily,

00:31.665 --> 00:33.134
Jane was there for him.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.636
Not as lucky?
Sister Luisa.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.438
See, she thought
she was going crazy

00:37.471 --> 00:40.241
because she was hallucinating
some guy named Carl.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.476
You see Carl here, right?

00:42.510 --> 00:43.511
No.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.146
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
So she checked herself

00:45.179 --> 00:46.714
into a psychiatric hospital.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.217
But OMG! Carl was real.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.219
See, Petra's twin sister,
Anezka,

00:51.252 --> 00:53.121
and their mother, Magda,
set Luisa up

00:53.154 --> 00:55.256
so they could assume control
of the hotel.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.625
In the event of
her incapacitation,

00:57.658 --> 00:59.593
all her hotel shares
go to Anezka.

00:59.627 --> 01:00.728
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.096
Straight out of
a telenovela, right?

01:02.130 --> 01:03.097
Well, imagine this.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.132
Jane's father

01:04.165 --> 01:06.100
was a huge telenovela star,

01:06.134 --> 01:09.270
but he absolutely hated
his costar, Fabian.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.672
Luckily, Fabian was killed off
their telenovela.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.207
Which reminds me,

01:13.241 --> 01:16.110
I did say
someone would die on ours.

01:17.145 --> 01:19.247
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva

01:19.280 --> 01:22.183
was 14 years old,
she was given a gift

01:22.216 --> 01:24.418
that would change her life.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.221
I love The House on Mango Street
so much.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.222
What should I read next?

01:28.256 --> 01:29.423
Is it time?

01:29.457 --> 01:31.292
I think so.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.827
We've been saving one
of our favorite recommendations,

01:33.861 --> 01:35.329
and we think
you're finally ready

01:35.363 --> 01:37.231
for Isabel Allende.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.233
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

01:39.267 --> 01:42.303
as Jane tore through the trials
of the Trueba family,

01:42.336 --> 01:45.173
she realized she wasn't the
only one who saw the world...

01:45.206 --> 01:47.375
a certain way.

01:47.408 --> 01:51.145
It's called magical realism.

01:51.179 --> 01:53.347
And there is a whole
Latin American

01:53.381 --> 01:54.515
literary tradition

01:54.548 --> 01:56.550
to explore.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.462
(chuckles softly)

02:08.496 --> 02:11.199
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And explore, Jane did.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.337
(sighs)

02:16.370 --> 02:17.938
Try this one.

02:17.971 --> 02:18.939
Now this.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.541
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And over the years,

02:20.574 --> 02:21.942
as Jane read

02:21.975 --> 02:24.178
more and more stories,

02:24.212 --> 02:25.846
her world opened up.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.920
And often, she felt inspired.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.358
(sighs)

02:39.260 --> 02:41.229
Always write

02:41.262 --> 02:42.230
when the spirit moves you.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.631
Also, as a sidenote,

02:43.664 --> 02:45.633
maybe it's time to have sex.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.901
I mean, you are
already pregnant.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.338
(laughs)
But, until then,

02:50.371 --> 02:52.706
go on. Write.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.842
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so, yes, this bookstore

02:54.875 --> 02:57.211
always held a special place
in Jane's heart.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.846
Which is why...

02:58.879 --> 03:00.748
When my book comes out,
it would mean the world to me

03:00.781 --> 03:02.416
to have my launch party here.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.285
Really?
I can't imagine

03:04.318 --> 03:05.286
doing it anywhere else.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.787
We'd be so honored!

03:06.820 --> 03:08.322
(all laugh)

03:08.356 --> 03:09.823
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here...

03:11.359 --> 03:12.360
...now.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.931
RAFAEL:
Oh, wow.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.300
It's your book, Mommy!

03:19.333 --> 03:20.834
It's finally here.
Yeah.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.305
(exhales shakily)
I'm a published freaking author!

03:24.338 --> 03:25.573
(all cheer)

03:25.606 --> 03:26.774
Hey!

03:26.807 --> 03:28.809
(humming)

03:41.989 --> 03:44.592
RAFAEL: You know Mateo
can't read, right?

03:44.625 --> 03:47.328
Oh, he's not allowed to read
my book till he's 25, anyway.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.662
But, when that day comes,

03:48.696 --> 03:50.398
I think he's gonna
be very touched

03:50.431 --> 03:52.500
that I wrote him a note
that was so thoughtful

03:52.533 --> 03:54.001
and moving.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.670
(ringtone plays)

03:57.738 --> 04:00.007
PETRA:
I need to vent.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.576
Anezka's offering guests
a discount for paying in cash.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.279
RAFAEL:
What? Why?

04:05.313 --> 04:07.281
So that she and my mother
can pocket it.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.115
They act like they're running

04:08.148 --> 04:09.550
a backroom poker game,
not a hotel.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.685
You have to help me
get her out of here.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.421
I'm sorry,
but I'm not getting involved

04:13.454 --> 04:14.522
with the hotel right now.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.589
What?

04:15.623 --> 04:16.890
Why not?

04:16.924 --> 04:18.459
Is Jane sitting right there?

04:18.492 --> 04:19.159
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes,

04:19.192 --> 04:21.562
the ghost of rivalries past.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.331
This is my choice.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.965
I've decided
I'm letting the hotel go

04:24.998 --> 04:26.434
until Luisa is better,

04:26.467 --> 04:27.535
and then we'll see
where we're at.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.069
Your sister
hallucinated a person.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.305
She could be in the
mental institution for months.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.407
I just need to step away
for my own well-being.

04:33.441 --> 04:36.344
Ugh, you need to get out
of the Villanueva house.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.446
Everything okay?

04:38.479 --> 04:41.315
Well, my sister's shares
have reverted back to a lunatic

04:41.349 --> 04:42.950
who's running the hotel I built
into the ground,

04:42.983 --> 04:44.418
and I can't even go inside

04:44.452 --> 04:46.086
to see my children.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.422
Remind me why I need to let go.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.591
Because lying
and sneaking around

04:50.624 --> 04:52.460
got you thrown in jail
in the past

04:52.493 --> 04:54.595
and run over by a car
in the present,

04:54.628 --> 04:56.497
so we need to protect
the future.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.432
Not just for you,
but for your children,

04:58.466 --> 05:02.035
who need you as a role model.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.805
Wow. Guilt plus scare tactics.
Well done.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.374
Thank you.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.509
And, not to pile on,

05:08.542 --> 05:10.077
but seeing as you're
stepping back until Luisa

05:10.110 --> 05:11.645
is declared mentally competent--

05:11.679 --> 05:13.914
which could take months--

05:13.947 --> 05:17.084
why not put out
some job feelers?

05:17.117 --> 05:19.052
What?

05:19.086 --> 05:20.754
Just to take off the
financial pressure

05:20.788 --> 05:22.356
until everything's
sorted out.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.858
(sputters) Plus, it'll
give you something to do.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.427
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And get you out of the house.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.430
Yeah. Why not?

05:29.463 --> 05:30.998
Maybe I could consult somewhere.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.099
Exactly.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.535
Like a boutique hotel.
That could be kind of cool.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.769
JANE:
Great.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.407
This note's everything.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.408
(giggles)

05:40.441 --> 05:42.676
I still can't believe it.

05:42.710 --> 05:46.079
In hardcover.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.448
(gasps)

05:47.481 --> 05:48.449
The new Angelique Harper?

05:48.482 --> 05:51.419
And a hardcover. How decadent.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.020
You okay?

05:53.053 --> 05:54.688
Yeah.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.724
Just taking it in.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.560
Overwhelmed.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.794
And how about that cover?

06:00.828 --> 06:03.531
Stop, this isn't about me.

06:03.564 --> 06:04.698
You're a published author.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.734
I'm a published author!

06:09.002 --> 06:11.439
Okay, okay, fine, fine.
I'll autograph your copy.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.106
Do your thing. Yes.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.175
That is you and me.
Aw.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.677
I'm the one with
the longer hair.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.979
(chuckles)

06:19.012 --> 06:21.582
Hey, so,
how's that party coming?

06:21.615 --> 06:23.150
Any agents RSVP yet?

06:23.183 --> 06:24.552
Yes, two so far.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.019
Plus Caridad PiÃ±eiro,

06:26.053 --> 06:28.489
who is, like, the queen
of the Latina romance world.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.691
And I sent

06:30.724 --> 06:32.860
a very carefully crafted tweet

06:32.893 --> 06:34.728
about the party
to Isabel Allende.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.530
Who?

06:36.564 --> 06:38.432
What?
What?

06:38.466 --> 06:40.568
She is, like, my favorite
author of all time.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.503
She's, like, my Stan Lee.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.872
Ah. Wow.
Mm-hmm.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.173
What did you tweet?

06:46.206 --> 06:48.809
(sighs)

06:48.842 --> 06:49.843
Oh.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.689
It-it may have gone on
a little long,

07:01.722 --> 07:03.924
but you get the point.
I invited her to the party.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.593
I am so proud of you.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.128
I love you.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.997
I love you, too.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.000
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah,
that didn't really happen.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.668
Thanks.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.504
I'm kind of proud of me, too.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.639
JANE: I can't believe
I almost said "I love you."

07:18.672 --> 07:19.607
I don't know what came over me.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.909
Sounds like love came over you.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.611
No. No, no, no, no.

07:23.644 --> 07:24.311
It is way too early.

07:24.344 --> 07:26.747
Uh, I think I just got swept up

07:26.780 --> 07:28.949
with excitement about my book.

07:28.982 --> 07:32.119
A-And he was so sweet
about my party.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.987
I'm not ready
to use the "L" word.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.155
MAGDA:
Lakomy.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.924
Velmi lakomy.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.992
I'm not being stingy

07:39.026 --> 07:41.529
because I refuse to let you
skim cash off the bookings.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.630
Okay.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.697
Let's take a vote.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.666
Who is for cash discounts?

07:45.699 --> 07:48.268
Oh, wait, I control
two-thirds of hotel.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.770
Two to one. I win again.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.705
MAGDA:
Perfect. Anezka,

07:51.739 --> 07:52.506
double the nightly rate.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.007
You can't just double
a hotel rate.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.643
There are price points.
Oh.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.511
Speaking of price points,

07:57.545 --> 07:59.012
ours has gone up.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.649
If you want us to walk away,

08:01.682 --> 08:03.617
we will need ten million.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.054
I don't have that kind of cash.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.789
Well, I guess you're just
going to have to book

08:08.822 --> 08:10.290
a lot of expensive rooms.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.892
(laughs quietly)
This plan makes no sense.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.528
We just had termites.
Bookings are down.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.796
We're trying
to bring people here,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.230
not drive them away.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.066
You don't have to go along
with her.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.601
You're the one
in charge of the hotel.

08:20.634 --> 08:21.769
Not her.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.538
Yes. I am in charge.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.907
That is why
I have new business shoes.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.711
And I trust Mother.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.780
It is like

08:32.813 --> 08:34.114
I am queen,

08:34.147 --> 08:35.649
and she is my hand.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.685
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, more like your hook.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.687
I never thought that I'd miss
having Luisa in charge.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.121
MAGDA:
Oh, really?

08:41.154 --> 08:44.124
And did Luisa tell you
she wanted to sell the hotel

08:44.157 --> 08:45.593
to get enough money

08:45.626 --> 08:48.629
to break her crime lord
girlfriend out of jail?

08:48.662 --> 08:50.598
(gasps)
What happened?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.666
Oh, uh, t-the villain
did something really bad.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.802
So sorry I'm late.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.770
Did Teresa finally tell Elena

08:56.804 --> 08:59.072
that Rodrigo was really
Juan Carlos in a bad wig?

08:59.106 --> 09:01.274
I actually don't mind the wig,
but no.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.911
She decided to keep it a secret
to use as leverage

09:03.944 --> 09:07.047
for when Raul reveals
that he's not actually dead.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.849
Classic. Come on, Mateo.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.183
You're coming to my house.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.252
Okay, I'm off to drop
signed copies of my book

09:12.285 --> 09:15.789
to the bookstore
because I am a published author.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.293
(cries out)

09:22.730 --> 09:24.064
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Look at her.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.033
Nothing can shake that smile.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.941
Oh, dear.

09:33.974 --> 09:37.845
Looks like the bottom
fell out of her plans.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.113
Ah!
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, come on, universe.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.782
That's a little on the nose.

09:47.888 --> 09:51.324
Hey, guys.
What's going on with the store?
Oh, no.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.826
I can't believe it.
In all the chaos,

09:52.860 --> 09:54.194
we just forgot.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.329
Well, what happened?
Our building was sold,

09:56.363 --> 09:58.365
and the new landlord
raised the rent.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.167
We can't afford it.
Wha...?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.735
We've been praying
for a miracle, but...

10:01.769 --> 10:04.938
JANE: No one knows
they're there anymore.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.406
I mean, more of us
buy our books online.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.275
No one goes to the bookstores.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.943
Oh, it's just so sad.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.712
That little place
is so magical,

10:11.745 --> 10:13.346
and it's the only bilingual
bookstore in the neighborhood.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.214
Sorry, hon.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.684
What about your party, though?
(sighs)

10:16.717 --> 10:18.719
Well, I'll just have to go
with Plan B, I guess.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.187
I'll have it
at the publisher's office.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.255
(gasps) Plan B?

10:22.289 --> 10:23.290
More like

10:23.323 --> 10:24.357
Plan Blech.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.294
Office parties are so sad.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.097
All the fluorescent lighting.
Sheet cake.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.331
And all the cubicles

10:31.364 --> 10:34.968
decorated with pictures
of people's sad,

10:35.002 --> 10:36.870
sad children.

10:36.904 --> 10:40.407
NARRATOR: FYI-- Rogelio
had a brief office job in 1998.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.142
It still haunts him.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.443
It'll be fine, Dad.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.445
Come on, Mr. Sweetface!
It's been five minutes.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.881
Time to go.
MATEO: No...!

10:47.915 --> 10:49.917
(mumbles)

10:53.153 --> 10:55.088
I have the most
amazing idea.
You're not recreating

10:55.122 --> 10:57.424
the bookstore on the set
of your telenovela.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.092
Why not?
Because when you

10:59.126 --> 11:01.895
recreated the house for Jane's
wedding, it cost you 50 grand.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.131
We don't have
that kind of money right now.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.432
The rent on our house...

11:05.465 --> 11:08.201
Our gorgeous
waterfront mansion, you mean.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.303
...is exorbitant.
Jane will be fine.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.405
She's a grown woman.
But it's my duty

11:12.439 --> 11:14.074
as her father...
Rogelio,

11:14.107 --> 11:17.745
if you build that bookstore,
plan on moving into it.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.914
No sulking.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.050
Go to work. You're gonna
be late for your fitting.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.085
*

11:29.289 --> 11:32.359
Oh. Good afternoon,
ex-costar.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.427
You must be here
for your funeral fitting.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.730
How is civilian life
as number none

11:36.764 --> 11:39.199
on the call sheet
treating you?

11:39.232 --> 11:42.102
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

11:42.135 --> 11:45.338
Hmm.
Now that you got
what you wanted...

11:45.372 --> 11:47.841
I'm wondering if you
can find it in your heart

11:47.875 --> 11:49.376
to give me what I want.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.912
A dignified farewell scene.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.514
But you are already dead.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.648
Not if I come back as a ghost.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.951
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh. Like in Our Town,

11:57.985 --> 12:00.420
when Emily appears as a ghost
at her own funeral.
Oh.

12:00.453 --> 12:04.291
Like Amor en la Familia,
when Matias comes back

12:04.324 --> 12:06.026
from the dead
to kill his stepbrother

12:06.059 --> 12:07.460
because he slept
with his father.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.529
NARRATOR: Or that.
Exactly!

12:09.562 --> 12:11.031
Just one scene.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.833
I'll come to my funeral
at full size,

12:12.866 --> 12:14.467
and make a short
but impassioned speech

12:14.501 --> 12:16.303
about the preciousness of life.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.172
I'm up for a movie,
and I'm looking

12:19.206 --> 12:20.941
for something dramatic
for my reading.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.143
You know, to
show my range.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.282
Come on,
sexpot to sexpot...

12:29.316 --> 12:30.851
can you help me?

12:32.019 --> 12:34.121
After all that
you have done

12:34.154 --> 12:37.290
to try to destroy my life
and sully my daughter,

12:37.324 --> 12:41.461
how dare you come and beg
for more screen time!

12:41.494 --> 12:45.365
I hope you never work
in this town... again.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.905
JANE:
That's it, huh?

12:51.939 --> 12:53.874
Yeah. My headhunter
said the same thing.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.509
I got to figure out a way
to beef it up a bit.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.511
It's not quantity,
it's quality.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.147
Plus, he says they'll
run a background check,

13:00.180 --> 13:01.514
and my criminal record
doesn't help.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.884
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I mean,
I could have told you that.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.452
You just got to keep
pounding the pavement.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.954
You'll find something.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.256
I hope so.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.224
*

13:11.258 --> 13:13.426
JANE:
It says that you're analytic,

13:13.460 --> 13:15.495
fair-minded, result-oriented,

13:15.528 --> 13:17.530
and incredibly sexy.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.267
Okay.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.434
(taps keyboard)

13:21.468 --> 13:23.303
Just joined LinkedIn.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.439
No! No, no, not LinkedIn.
What's wrong with it?

13:26.473 --> 13:27.941
Oh, when you sign up,
it e-mails everyone

13:27.975 --> 13:30.277
in your whole address book
for, like, eternity.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.611
No, that can't be true.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.246
PETRA:
LinkedIn? Are you serious?

13:33.280 --> 13:35.415
I didn't know. I'm sorry.
Where are the girls?

13:35.448 --> 13:36.583
On their way
with their nanny.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.285
And you should be
working here.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.486
My mother is a horror show.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.588
We've been losing bookings
left and right.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.423
You think I don't want
to be near my kids?

13:43.456 --> 13:45.492
You think it's easy for me
to watch your mother and sister

13:45.525 --> 13:46.559
run our hotel into the ground?

13:46.593 --> 13:48.261
Then let's come up with a plan.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.629
Our last plan left me
with three broken ribs.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.464
I am done scheming.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.600
I am looking
for a short-term job.

13:53.633 --> 13:57.104
NARRATOR: Pro tip-- leave
"short-term" off your rÃ©sumÃ©.

13:57.137 --> 14:00.473
Okay... so what
if the Marbella hires you?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.142
As our...
general manager.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.610
What? We need one.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.545
You know the place.
Why work somewhere else?

14:05.578 --> 14:06.446
You'll see the girls.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.481
You'll be able to help out
with the hotel.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.517
Magda will never go for it.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.552
Let me at least try.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.521
Absolutely not.
Why would I do that?

14:14.554 --> 14:16.489
To make the hotel
profitable.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.191
Rafael's the only person

14:18.225 --> 14:19.526
who knows this place
as well as I do.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.594
Without him around to keep
things running smoothly,

14:21.628 --> 14:23.663
there is no way
I can get you that money.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.232
Trust me.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.434
All I want is for you to leave.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.069
Fine.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.604
I will take a meeting with him.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.612
LUISA:
Carl is real,

14:39.646 --> 14:41.114
and he uses an inhaler.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.019
*

14:50.723 --> 14:52.926
ANEZKA:
Someone's clumsy.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.631
Those shoes are ridiculous.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.702
KRISHNA: But a lot
of people have asthma.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.371
Well, my mother doesn't.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.639
And neither does Anezka.

15:06.673 --> 15:10.043
Yeah, look, it's a long shot.
Just show me the footage.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.312
What time did you overhear
my mother and sister

15:12.345 --> 15:14.081
talking about Luisa?
Close to midnight.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.615
I remember because
I looked at my watch,

15:15.648 --> 15:17.717
and I thought, "This
is no way to live."

15:17.750 --> 15:20.520
Okay. Good, good.
Go to 11:45.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.724
Okay, now scroll through
slowly till midnight.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.193
No, wait.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.429
That's Luisa. It has to be.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.533
(gasps softly)

15:33.566 --> 15:35.435
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Is it me, or does that shadow

15:35.468 --> 15:39.172
totally have asthma?
Oh, my God.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.940
Carl is real.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.147
They must have wanted you
to overhear them talking

15:47.180 --> 15:49.249
about Luisa being insane--
they were setting you up!

15:49.282 --> 15:52.385
Well, and if Carl is real,
that means Luisa's

15:52.419 --> 15:54.687
in a mental institution
for nothing, right?

15:54.721 --> 15:56.456
Well...
No, well, not for nothing--
she was still trying

15:56.489 --> 15:58.325
to break a mass murderer
out of jail.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.692
That's legitimately crazy,
right?

16:00.627 --> 16:02.129
But not hallucination crazy.

16:02.162 --> 16:05.465
Which means I have to tell Raf,
don't I? And I will.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.134
Very shortly.
But first I'm gonna use this

16:07.167 --> 16:09.369
to get rid of my mother,
and you're gonna help me do it.

16:09.402 --> 16:12.539
Mrs. Solano... this is
way beyond the scope of my job.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.443
So I'm gonna need a raise.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.379
ROGELIO:
It's done.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.114
The bookstore is staying open.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.782
Jane, update
your paperless post.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.585
Your dream party
is back on track.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.154
I took care of everything.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.422
So call me back. I love you.

16:30.423 --> 16:33.260
Took care of
everything? How?

16:34.661 --> 16:37.497
Remember when I was
in People en EspaÃ±ol's

16:37.530 --> 16:39.166
"50 Most Beautiful" list?

16:39.199 --> 16:40.633
You've mentioned it
once or twice.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.435
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
A day.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.571
Well, I stayed friends
with the editor, Arianna,

16:44.604 --> 16:46.806
and she's going to do
a feature on the party.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.409
That will bring the store
tons of exposure, attention,

16:49.442 --> 16:52.545
and, in the words of Abba,
"Money, money, money."

16:52.579 --> 16:54.581
What?
I told her
everything Jane said

16:54.614 --> 16:58.585
about what the community will
gain by having a physical space

16:58.618 --> 17:00.320
to shop, how the Internet

17:00.353 --> 17:02.322
is ruining us all, uh,
bilingual bookstores,

17:02.355 --> 17:05.492
blah, blah, blah, and she
said there's a story there!

17:05.525 --> 17:06.726
But what does
that have to do

17:06.759 --> 17:08.528
with Alexandro
and Enrique's lease?

17:08.561 --> 17:12.199
Press plus celeb photos
equals business.

17:12.232 --> 17:16.069
And what if your calculation
doesn't add up?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.540
It will. Trust me.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.675
And I cosigned the lease
on the bookstore,

17:22.709 --> 17:24.477
just to make
everyone comfortable.

17:24.511 --> 17:28.381
So if they can't pay their rent,
we'll be responsible for it?

17:28.415 --> 17:31.584
Yes, but, Xiomara,
I know how press works.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.620
Trust me, after the party,
that couple

17:33.653 --> 17:35.655
will be looking to expand,
they'll have

17:35.688 --> 17:38.258
so much business.
MAGDA: Let's talk business.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.861
Did you cut the legs
off this chair?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.296
Few inches.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.565
It's an old Czech
intimidation technique.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.534
So, I see

17:47.567 --> 17:49.736
you've spent time in prison.

17:49.769 --> 17:50.770
I like that.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.306
Shows you can get scrappy.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.575
Okay.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.378
Great. So I'm... hired?

17:58.411 --> 17:59.546
Yes.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.848
But not as general manager.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.550
A bartender?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.485
Apparently, the Prague
pirate doesn't think

18:05.518 --> 18:08.321
I have the experience to manage
the hotel that I founded.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.557
She's just doing this
to humiliate me.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.626
Yeah, and... so what if she is?

18:13.660 --> 18:14.794
Look, if you take the job,

18:14.827 --> 18:16.563
you'll be able to keep
an eye on the hotel,

18:16.596 --> 18:18.498
you'll be close to the twins,
you can help Petra

18:18.531 --> 18:20.500
when a crisis comes up...
I can help Petra

18:20.533 --> 18:22.302
by being the manager
of the Marbella.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.670
I am not some bartender.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.474
What's the alternative?

18:27.507 --> 18:29.509
You're gonna work the front desk
at the Holiday Inn?

18:29.542 --> 18:31.644
NARRATOR: Between you and me,
he didn't get that job.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.646
You got to get over yourself.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.682
It's a job. You're broke.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.883
Okay. You're right.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.719
Huh! That was quick.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.888
Oh, we're in a groove.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.690
Oh, great!

18:43.723 --> 18:45.258
Now, if you'll

18:45.292 --> 18:48.195
excuse me, I have a date.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.363
Are you stealing food
from the kitchen?

18:50.397 --> 18:52.265
Perks of management.

18:57.204 --> 18:57.904
MAN:
Hold the elevator.
Oh.

18:57.937 --> 18:58.838
(Jane chuckles)

19:01.374 --> 19:02.909
Hold the elevator!

19:02.942 --> 19:04.444
Okay.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.482
(bell dings)

19:09.516 --> 19:12.385
*

19:13.686 --> 19:16.956
So, my publisher set up
a mini book tour

19:16.989 --> 19:19.459
for me next week.
Wow. Fancy.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.727
I might have oversold it.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.663
Two stops, both
in Florida. Ow.

19:23.696 --> 19:24.764
Still pretty badass.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.533
Agreed. (laughs)

19:26.566 --> 19:28.535
Anyway, um...

19:29.802 --> 19:32.439
I was wondering if
you wanted to come.

19:32.472 --> 19:35.842
W-We can make it into
a little road trip.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.311
Make a playlist,
eat fast food.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.847
Huh? Maybe go wild and
get a speeding ticket.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.949
Really?
Okay, no speeding ticket.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.517
You want me to come?

19:44.551 --> 19:45.752
Yeah.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.787
Because I love you.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.323
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Again... that didn't happen.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.459
Here's what Jane really said.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.662
Yeah, it'd be fun.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.697
Let me just look
at my deadlines.
Of course.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.300
JANE: I can't believe I
almost said "I love you" again.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.802
XIOMARA: You're obviously
feeling it. Why not say it?

20:02.835 --> 20:04.804
Because I don't know if I'm...

20:04.837 --> 20:06.939
really in love.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.875
And I don't know
if he loves me back.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.510
ROGELIO:
That's ludicrous.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.412
Anyone with a pulse
will love you back.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.814
I-I got to go, Mom.
I'll talk to you later.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.649
It's impossible not to love you.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.485
Everyone loves you, Jane.

20:18.518 --> 20:19.819
Rudy! How much
do you love Jane?

20:19.852 --> 20:21.754
Uh, a lot?

20:21.788 --> 20:22.789
Exactly.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.657
Okay, so, um,
my publishers

20:24.691 --> 20:26.559
e-mailed me, and apparently,
they reached out to Arianna

20:26.593 --> 20:28.561
a few times, and she
hasn't returned their calls.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.763
What?
I know. Weird, right?

20:30.797 --> 20:33.800
Maybe you can ask her
to call them back.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.402
Arianna's
not gonna call them back.

20:36.803 --> 20:37.970
And she's definitely not
gonna write a feature

20:38.004 --> 20:40.673
on your book party.
What? Why?

20:40.707 --> 20:43.410
Because I told her
I'd appreciate it if she didn't.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.412
And why would
she listen

20:45.445 --> 20:46.713
to you, peasant?!
Maybe because

20:46.746 --> 20:48.648
I'm making sweet
love to her.

20:48.681 --> 20:49.916
(tires screech)
Oh!

20:49.949 --> 20:52.752
Oh! Look who else
just got screwed!

20:52.785 --> 20:54.387
How did you know
about any of this?

20:54.421 --> 20:56.789
Well, the walls between our
dressing rooms are quite thin.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.691
And since I was
in People en EspaÃ±ol's

20:58.725 --> 20:59.859
"30 Under 30" this year,

20:59.892 --> 21:01.461
I happen to know
Arianna quite well.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.062
"30 Under 30"
means nothing

21:03.095 --> 21:04.931
compared to
"50 Most Beautiful People!"

21:04.964 --> 21:06.666
I was in high school
when you did that! I'm...
JANE: Stop!

21:06.699 --> 21:08.301
I can't believe this.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.836
How come you just can't
mind your own business?

21:09.869 --> 21:11.438
Maybe you should have
your father explain that

21:11.471 --> 21:12.805
to his friend Judy?

21:12.839 --> 21:13.940
Judy was
a spur-of-the-moment impulse

21:13.973 --> 21:16.376
that paid off mightily.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.945
But you planned this. You
found out I needed a favor

21:18.978 --> 21:20.547
from this woman,
so you seduced her,

21:20.580 --> 21:22.615
and got inside of her head.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.917
You're good.
You're disgusting.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.487
So I assume you'll get
Arianna back on the story

21:27.520 --> 21:29.722
if I get you your
pretentious ghost monologue?

21:29.756 --> 21:30.957
Bingo.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.393
Fine. I'll get the
writers on it.

21:33.426 --> 21:34.694
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
What would a ghost even say?

21:34.727 --> 21:35.962
FABIAN:
Not good enough.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.030
I want you to write it.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.866
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, boo.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.709
Why do you have
to write it?

21:49.742 --> 21:51.744
Fabian says it's because
I wrote the monologue

21:51.778 --> 21:53.680
that got Dad
a Paloma nomination,

21:53.713 --> 21:55.848
but I think
it's just to torture us both.

21:55.882 --> 21:58.017
Ugh! If your father
hadn't co-signed the lease

21:58.050 --> 21:59.919
on the bookstore, you
wouldn't be in this position.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.721
It's fine. I'm almost done.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.757
And it's actually pretty good,
you know, for a ghost soliloquy.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.460
I mean, I avoided
all the obvious clichÃ©s.

22:07.494 --> 22:10.463
Still, it's just
so outrageous.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.831
Are you okay, Ma?

22:11.864 --> 22:13.700
Because Dad does this kind
of stuff all the time.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.469
You know the guy likes
to go big. You know that.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.670
It's just...

22:17.704 --> 22:19.539
What?

22:19.572 --> 22:22.675
My dance studio hasn't
been doing so great.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.378
Oh, no.
And I wanted to
talk to your father

22:25.412 --> 22:26.646
about putting
some money there.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.014
How bad is it?

22:28.047 --> 22:29.749
I just need
a little cash infusion,

22:29.782 --> 22:32.151
but it's not like banks are
lining up to lend money

22:32.184 --> 22:33.753
to struggling
local dance studios.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.922
And our monthly
budget is stretched

22:35.955 --> 22:38.625
as it is because of the rent
on our giant house.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.092
Ma, don't stress.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.694
Dad won't have
to use this money.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.863
I'll get Fabian
the monologue ASAP.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.498
He'll love it.
It's perfect for him.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.933
Super dramatic, you know?

22:46.966 --> 22:48.668
So he can do
his over-the-top acting.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.838
I just can't do it anymore,
Krishna! I just feel too guilty.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.740
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Speaking
of over-the-top-acting...

22:53.773 --> 22:55.942
Anybody would. You've been
lying for a long time.

22:55.975 --> 22:58.511
Look, you don't have
to remind me!

22:58.545 --> 22:59.846
It's my mother's fault.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.681
She said we should
use Anezka as a pawn.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.750
(gasps)

23:03.783 --> 23:06.018
It's not true.

23:06.052 --> 23:09.789
I am so sorry.
I was going to tell you.

23:09.822 --> 23:10.957
I...
(stammers)

23:10.990 --> 23:12.759
I-I feel badly.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.661
But I knew
Luisa wouldn't trust me,

23:14.694 --> 23:15.962
and Mother suggested using you.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.598
No. You're lying.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.467
No, I'm not.

23:20.500 --> 23:24.070
You know what? Let's go.
We'll confront her together.

23:24.103 --> 23:27.073
That is not true, Anezka.
She is lying.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.775
Mother, stop.
I told her already.

23:28.808 --> 23:29.976
MAGDA:
I am not working with Petra.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.778
Don't be stupid.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.446
She's not stupid!
She just didn't think

23:33.480 --> 23:34.947
her mother could
be so cruel.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.783
Don't let her use you anymore.
She's a liar. You know this.

23:36.816 --> 23:37.717
This is the same woman
who abandoned you

23:37.750 --> 23:39.452
because she said
you weren't the pretty one.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.821
She's just trying
to get into your head.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.823
I'm not trying to get
into anyone's head.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.458
I just don't want
to keep deceiving my sister.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.827
And I know this
was my idea, but

23:47.860 --> 23:50.062
I realized something:
you're the evil one, not her.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.664
This is absurd.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.833
She has no proof.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.703
Oh, yeah? Then how would
I know Carl is real?

23:59.205 --> 24:02.108
I'm done, Mother.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.511
RAFAEL:
I can't believe this.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.546
Queen Magda has me scheduled
for a shift tonight

24:06.579 --> 24:07.847
during your book party,
and she won't

24:07.880 --> 24:09.549
let me out of it.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.250
It's okay. I understand.

24:11.283 --> 24:14.053
That's the way it is
when you have a regular job.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.789
I bet I can duck out for,
like, an hour.

24:16.823 --> 24:20.159
Stop. It's so not a big deal.

24:20.192 --> 24:21.861
I'll give you a play-by-play.

24:21.894 --> 24:24.030
Okay, well,

24:24.063 --> 24:26.633
have fun tonight.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.606
She seemed cool.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.544
Not bummed... like, at all.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.178
XIOMARA: I just hope
Jane's books sell,

24:39.211 --> 24:42.048
or Rogelio will buy up
every last copy,

24:42.081 --> 24:43.750
and then order
a thousand more online.

24:43.783 --> 24:46.218
This about the lease?

24:46.252 --> 24:48.755
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, look
who's become one of the girls.

24:48.788 --> 24:51.758
He goes so overboard, especially
when it comes to Jane.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.626
Maybe it's a guy thing.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.795
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or not.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.197
I'm not saying that it's okay,

24:58.230 --> 25:01.934
just that it's this...
feeling.

25:01.968 --> 25:04.203
You know,
like you have to provide.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.938
And it's so easy

25:05.972 --> 25:09.308
to lose perspective
and go overboard.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.978
Look at everything I did
to try to get the Marbella back.

25:12.011 --> 25:15.147
And I'd still do anything
for my family, even...

25:15.181 --> 25:17.717
wear a silk screen bowtie.

25:19.919 --> 25:22.221
Okay, next time you see me,
I might be quitting,

25:22.254 --> 25:24.791
because this book party
might just launch my career.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.759
(laughing)

25:26.793 --> 25:28.595
This monologue is a
stinky piece of garbage,

25:28.628 --> 25:29.896
and I hardly
understand it!

25:29.929 --> 25:32.231
It's like I'm falling
for you all over again.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.966
You need to fix
this right now!

25:34.000 --> 25:35.835
They are filming my
coverage tonight!

25:35.868 --> 25:37.069
Sorry. Any rewrite's
gonna have to wait.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.838
My book party's
in a few hours. (squeals)

25:38.871 --> 25:41.007
Well, if you don't do
the rewrite right now,

25:41.040 --> 25:44.010
you can kiss the People
en EspaÃ±ol article bye-bye-bye.

25:44.043 --> 25:47.580
What? No, no, you
can't do that to me.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.584
(groans)

25:51.618 --> 25:53.886
ANEZKA:
I can't do this anymore!

25:53.920 --> 25:56.088
I don't know who to believe.

25:56.122 --> 25:59.892
You were the only one
who really loved me.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.829
I wish you were here
to guide me.

26:02.862 --> 26:07.800
I wish...
I could be kissing your face

26:07.834 --> 26:10.169
and your beard.

26:10.202 --> 26:12.872
Both beard.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.842
If you'd just send me a sign...

26:15.875 --> 26:18.277
Yes, you're right,
I should have a drink.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.647
Maybe little snack, too.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.981
Can we get more nuts here?
NARRATOR: I don't think so.

26:22.014 --> 26:24.150
It's already pretty crazy.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.852
Oh, actual nuts.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.954
Meh.
Meh?

26:27.987 --> 26:29.989
What-what does "meh" mean?

26:30.022 --> 26:32.291
It means "ugh, bleh," or...
(blows raspberry)

26:32.324 --> 26:35.662
Charming.
It needs more pizzazz,
more sparkle.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.363
It needs
to be more... flowery.

26:37.396 --> 26:39.098
Okay, flowery. Fine.

26:39.131 --> 26:42.034
I can do flowery.
Flowery is my specialty.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.804
Now it has too many
describey words.
Adjectives?

26:44.837 --> 26:46.873
No, words that describe
other words.

26:46.906 --> 26:48.307
You said you wanted flowery.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.009
Yes, but not so flowery.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.211
If I hand you a bouquet
of flowers, you will smile.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.846
But if I hand you
a thousand flowers, you will

26:53.880 --> 26:55.948
suffocate to death under
the weight of all those flowers.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.984
I'll make it less flowery,
but we have to move fast here.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.386
I have to pick up my dress
from the dry cleaner by 5:00.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.927
Well, now it's just boring.
Ugh! I-I don't get it.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.428
I-I don't understand
what you want.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.398
Okay, if I hand you
a hundred flowers...
No, no.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.066
No more flower analogies.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.902
Just tell me what you want.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.203
I want it to be epic!

27:17.236 --> 27:18.938
I want people to weep.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.207
I want them to feel sorry
for taking me for granted!

27:21.240 --> 27:23.275
Because
they won't realize

27:23.309 --> 27:25.978
until I'm gone how much
they really loved me.
JANE: Honestly, Fabian,

27:26.012 --> 27:27.780
I tried everything.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.448
I just feel like we're
going in circles here.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.317
I-I don't see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.952
(gasps)
Yes! That!

27:32.985 --> 27:34.386
That's excellent writing!

27:34.420 --> 27:35.521
I want those words
in my speech.
You want

27:35.554 --> 27:38.758
"The light at the end of the
tunnel" in your monologue?

27:38.791 --> 27:40.292
Yes. It's such a nice image.

27:40.326 --> 27:43.162
Clean, original, specific.

27:43.195 --> 27:45.998
No... adjectives.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.800
Hmm. Okay.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.168
Do you also like,

27:49.201 --> 27:51.871
"Until my death we were
two peas in a pod"?
Yes!

27:51.904 --> 27:53.239
Yes, peas in a pod!

27:53.272 --> 27:56.242
Another great image.
Now you're getting it!

27:56.275 --> 27:58.244
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And
in that moment, Jane realized

27:58.277 --> 28:00.446
exactly the kind of speech
Fabian wanted.

28:00.479 --> 28:03.015
And friends, I don't think
Jane would mind me saying

28:03.049 --> 28:05.017
that what she wrote was
as hackey a monologue

28:05.051 --> 28:06.786
as the world has ever seen.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.888
Riddled with every clichÃ©
she could think of.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.097
It's perfect.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.899
Oh, thank God
for small favors.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.333
You are on fire!

28:21.367 --> 28:24.136
It's exactly like God
has done me a small favor.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.939
I knew you were a great writer,
but this... this, I-I...

28:26.973 --> 28:29.041
Takes the cake?
Yes! Exactly!

28:29.075 --> 28:31.110
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Enough with the clichÃ©s!
Great!

28:31.143 --> 28:33.746
So you're gonna call Arianna,
make sure she's at the party?

28:33.780 --> 28:35.214
Yes! I'll call her right away.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.984
Now go, or as you so beautifully
put it, "Haste makes waste!"

28:43.923 --> 28:46.258
No. Ma, stop. I don't have time
for smoky eyes.

28:46.292 --> 28:49.495
Where's the sitter?
Inhala, exhala, Jane.

28:49.528 --> 28:50.629
(doorbell rings)
That must be her.

28:50.662 --> 28:52.264
This is so pretty.
Can I wear it?
Of course you can.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.500
Bling!
(ringtone plays)

28:54.533 --> 28:57.036
Oh. I'm running late

28:57.069 --> 28:59.872
so I can't talk, but I will
see you at the party in 20.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.473
ADAM:
Wait. Wait. Bad news.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.410
I just got slammed with notes,
and they pulled my deadline up.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.779
What?
ADAM: Yeah.

29:06.813 --> 29:08.948
I have to turn in the panels
tonight,

29:08.981 --> 29:12.484
so I can't make it
to your party. I'm so sorry.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.253
No, I get it.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.388
Hey, don't even worry about it.
It's all good.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.556
Have a great night, Jane.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.158
You deserve it.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.492
Thanks.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.232
Adam can't come. Work.
Mm.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.034
It's fine.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.503
Rafael can't come, either.

29:31.537 --> 29:32.471
I mean, that's the one
that really stings

29:32.504 --> 29:35.074
because he told me
to write the book, you know?

29:35.107 --> 29:37.476
Aw.
Why "aw"?

29:45.451 --> 29:47.019
What?

29:47.053 --> 29:51.523
Well, I just didn't want
to make him feel bad. (sighs)

29:51.557 --> 29:53.125
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw, he definitely does

29:53.159 --> 29:55.461
look a little... bummed.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.830
JANE: Can I get a rum
and Coke, please?

29:57.864 --> 30:00.566
Wow. You look great.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.501
You, too.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.570
Cute outfit.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.473
So, what are
you doing here?

30:07.506 --> 30:11.878
Isn't your party starting,
like... seven minutes ago?

30:14.146 --> 30:16.582
Ugh! Rum and Cherry Coke?

30:16.615 --> 30:18.484
Oh, I'm still figuring
out the soda gun.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.019
(laughs)

30:20.052 --> 30:21.854
Well, I just wanted
to tell you

30:21.888 --> 30:24.957
that I'm really bummed
you can't come tonight.

30:24.991 --> 30:26.392
Really?

30:26.425 --> 30:28.627
Mm-hmm.
I'll quit.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.062
You're not...
you're not quitting.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.331
But I just wanted
you to know that.

30:32.364 --> 30:37.503
And... I wanted you
to see the acknowledgements.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.538
To Michael?
No, that's the dedication.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.874
The acknowledgements are
in the back.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.493
Wow.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.662
Are you gonna cry?
What? No.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.998
It's sweat.
Bartenders don't cry.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.534
(laughs)
Now go. Okay?

31:08.567 --> 31:10.536
Enjoy your party.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.504
(exhales)

31:17.944 --> 31:21.113
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here, now.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.654
*

31:30.056 --> 31:32.058
(exhales)

31:37.663 --> 31:40.066
(exhales)

31:42.534 --> 31:43.502
(indistinct chatter)

31:43.535 --> 31:44.971
ENRIQUE:
Jane!

31:45.004 --> 31:47.306
The store hasn't been
this crowded

31:47.339 --> 31:48.674
in years!
Yesterday,

31:48.707 --> 31:51.177
we couldn't even afford
a tiny ad,

31:51.210 --> 31:55.314
and now we are getting a feature
in People en EspaÃ±ol!

31:55.347 --> 31:56.682
(all laughing)

31:56.715 --> 31:59.218
It's perfect!
Aw!

31:59.251 --> 32:01.053
FABIAN:
Jane!

32:01.087 --> 32:02.688
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Almost perfect.

32:02.721 --> 32:05.024
Uh-uh.
Oh.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.026
What are you doing here?

32:07.059 --> 32:09.095
Huh? Aren't you supposed to be
shooting your ghost monologue?

32:09.128 --> 32:11.630
I snuck away from set and told
the director I was going 10-2.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.735
It is way too late
for another rewrite.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.737
No, no, the monologue
is perfect.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.740
But... Arianna's not coming.

32:21.773 --> 32:22.708
What?
She saw a picture

32:22.741 --> 32:23.642
of me online with another lover,

32:23.675 --> 32:25.377
and now she wants nothing
to do with me.

32:25.411 --> 32:27.113
I'm so sorry.

32:27.146 --> 32:30.316
Why would you post
something like that?

32:30.349 --> 32:31.550
I didn't! I was tagged.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.385
NARRATOR:
Ugh, I've been there, buddy.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.987
Oh, no. Oh, my...

32:35.021 --> 32:36.989
After all that work?

32:37.023 --> 32:39.158
What am I supposed to tell
Alejandro and Enrique?

32:39.191 --> 32:40.726
I will make it up to you, Jane.
I promise.

32:40.759 --> 32:44.563
I'm gonna start a category 7
tweetstorm for all the fans

32:44.596 --> 32:46.298
and telenovela stars
to come down here immediately.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.734
That will get
instant publicity.
Not enough.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.769
Do not underestimate the power
of my shirtlessness.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.072
No, this is an emergency.

32:53.105 --> 32:56.008
I'm going to go completely naked
and cover my precious junk

32:56.042 --> 32:57.509
with your precious book.

32:58.544 --> 32:59.645
I may need two.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.380
Ay.
Where's the bathroom?

33:03.682 --> 33:05.651
What did
the featherbed want?

33:05.684 --> 33:07.586
Arianna's not coming.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.755
I will kill him,
in real life this time!

33:09.788 --> 33:11.390
Dad, no. It's
not his fault.

33:11.423 --> 33:12.691
Of course it is.

33:12.724 --> 33:14.160
No, it's not. It's yours.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.427
I'm sorry, but it is

33:15.461 --> 33:17.196
because of you
that we are in this situation.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.598
You're on the hook for the
lease. Mom is gonna be furious.

33:19.631 --> 33:22.268
And the bookstore is not gonna
get the press that they need.

33:22.301 --> 33:24.403
All because you
wanted to swoop in

33:24.436 --> 33:26.538
with your ridiculous scheme to
be a hero, when I could've just

33:26.572 --> 33:29.808
easily had the party
at the publisher's office.

33:29.841 --> 33:33.079
I just wanted you to have
the book party of your dreams.

33:33.112 --> 33:35.081
I know.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.716
But why do you always have
to go too far, Dad?

33:37.749 --> 33:39.051
Huh?

33:39.085 --> 33:41.287
I guess I overcompensate.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.622
I mean, I-I wasn't around
when you were a kid...

33:43.655 --> 33:46.692
Seriously, this can't be your
excuse anymore. We're beyond it.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.560
You didn't even know
I'd been born!

33:48.594 --> 33:50.196
How can you blame yourself
for something

33:50.229 --> 33:51.263
that you didn't
even know happened?

33:51.297 --> 33:53.232
Because maybe I did know.

33:53.265 --> 33:54.700
What?

33:54.733 --> 33:57.069
I mean, I didn't know.

33:57.103 --> 33:59.805
But a part of me--
I don't know--

33:59.838 --> 34:02.374
always suspected, maybe...

34:02.408 --> 34:06.412
I mean, I-I knew
how religious Alba was.

34:06.445 --> 34:09.481
And-and maybe I didn't ever
call your mom

34:09.515 --> 34:11.550
because I didn't want to know.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.684
In case.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.353
I-I had dreams,

34:14.386 --> 34:16.855
ambitions.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.125
Do you hate me?

34:19.158 --> 34:21.627
You were 16.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.529
I get it.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.863
Really?

34:24.896 --> 34:25.764
I mean, I wish you'd called.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.234
Because I would have
found you sooner.

34:28.267 --> 34:29.501
But everything happens

34:29.535 --> 34:30.736
for a reason, right?

34:30.769 --> 34:32.804
And I like where
we're at now.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.506
So let's just
keep moving forward

34:34.540 --> 34:36.842
and not keep coming back
to this.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.477
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And in that moment,

34:38.510 --> 34:41.847
Rogelio let the ghost
of his past go.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.383
Thank you, Jane.
Mm-hmm.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.652
Now go take care
of your adoring fans.

34:46.685 --> 34:49.388
(exhales)
And remember what I taught you
about selfie angles.

34:49.421 --> 34:50.822
Chin down, camera up.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.824
(chuckles)
First, I have to break the news

34:52.858 --> 34:54.693
to Alejandro and Enrique.

35:00.866 --> 35:03.402
(sighs)

35:10.909 --> 35:11.810
(gasps)

35:11.843 --> 35:13.879
Do I know you?

35:13.912 --> 35:14.880
(whispers):
Oh, my God.

35:14.913 --> 35:16.114
You're real.

35:17.916 --> 35:19.618
(chuckles)

35:23.422 --> 35:27.193
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Come on, Jane, use your words.
I'm sorry.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.294
I'm overwhelmed because you're,

35:28.327 --> 35:30.196
like, my favorite author
of all time,

35:30.229 --> 35:32.798
and you're actually standing
here. And, I mean, for years,

35:32.831 --> 35:35.367
I sat in that very corner
and I read every single one

35:35.401 --> 35:38.204
of your books, and...
NARRATOR:
Okay, maybe use less words.

35:38.237 --> 35:39.771
It just feels so magical

35:39.805 --> 35:41.607
that you actually
saw my tweets and came.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.343
NARRATOR: To clarify,
she didn't see Jane's tweets.

35:44.376 --> 35:45.744
She saw these...

35:52.351 --> 35:54.353
Your book...

35:54.386 --> 35:55.954
means everything to me.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.190
The House of the Spirits?

36:02.294 --> 36:04.330
Well, I loved that one, yes.

36:04.363 --> 36:07.466
Um, but I was talking
about Paula.

36:10.369 --> 36:14.306
It helped me through my grief,
when my husband died.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.875
I'm so sorry. When was that?

36:16.908 --> 36:21.247
Uh, four years ago.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.282
Oh.
I'm sorry. It's-it's
the combination

36:23.315 --> 36:25.917
of feeling him everywhere
tonight. And you actually

36:25.951 --> 36:28.454
being here feels
like... well...

36:29.488 --> 36:31.557
...like magical realism.

36:31.590 --> 36:35.227
Well, writing helped me
through my grief, too.

36:35.261 --> 36:38.964
There's light at the end
of the tunnel, I promise.

36:38.997 --> 36:41.233
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Man, when she says it,

36:41.267 --> 36:43.435
it sounds brand-new.

36:43.469 --> 36:46.272
Sometimes I just feel so guilty.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.474
Telling your story
doesn't betray the memory--

36:48.507 --> 36:50.442
it keeps the spirits alive.

36:50.476 --> 36:51.677
About...

36:51.710 --> 36:54.012
living, I mean.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.014
Being joyful,

36:56.047 --> 36:58.317
when he's not here
to share it with me.

36:58.350 --> 37:01.953
How can I be happy or in love?

37:01.987 --> 37:06.392
I write about strong women
with passionate hearts.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.694
It's all about the heart.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.262
It's what drives us and...

37:10.296 --> 37:11.763
Determines your fate.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.565
I'm sorry, I've
seen your TED Talk,

37:13.599 --> 37:14.700
like, a million times.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.368
NARRATOR:
Back off, stalker.

37:16.402 --> 37:19.438
Well, magical realism
can work both ways.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.238
You are mine.

37:20.272 --> 37:24.676
You are the reader
I always imagined.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.513
Let yourself enjoy your success.

37:27.546 --> 37:29.915
Just live passionately,

37:29.948 --> 37:32.451
love passionately.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.423
NARRATOR: Which brings us here.
The whole thing was perfect.

37:37.456 --> 37:40.459
I did a reading,
I sold 67 books,

37:40.492 --> 37:42.628
and Isabel Allende was there.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.463
Wow.
And she was everything

37:44.496 --> 37:45.697
I imagined her to be.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.866
And she made me realize that
I have to tell you something.

37:47.899 --> 37:50.369
And you might freak out, because
you might not be ready...

37:50.402 --> 37:51.970
(stammers)

37:52.003 --> 37:54.306
...but I have
to live passionately

37:54.340 --> 37:56.442
and so-- what...

37:56.475 --> 37:57.609
what is wrong?
(chuckles)

37:57.643 --> 37:59.545
(shuddering breath)

37:59.578 --> 38:02.781
I'm moving to L.A.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.716
What?

38:04.750 --> 38:07.319
The VFX house that wanted
to hire me a couple months ago,

38:07.353 --> 38:08.854
they-they contacted me again.

38:08.887 --> 38:11.390
I said no,

38:11.423 --> 38:13.325
but they came back
with an even bigger offer.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.394
When?

38:15.427 --> 38:16.695
Earlier today,
before your party.

38:19.731 --> 38:21.333
I'm sorry.
I just have to take it.

38:21.367 --> 38:24.403
You don't have to take it.

38:24.436 --> 38:27.038
You want to.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.915
Is that why you
didn't come tonight?

38:36.948 --> 38:40.519
I didn't want to be
in all your pictures.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.854
I'm so sorry.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.356
It's just watching
what you've been experiencing

38:44.390 --> 38:47.393
the past few weeks,
your dreams coming to life,

38:47.426 --> 38:49.395
it... it just,
it made me want

38:49.428 --> 38:50.996
to pursue my own dreams.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.864
Good luck in L.A.

38:54.633 --> 38:57.035
I just feel so stupid.

38:57.068 --> 39:00.606
No, Jane.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.941
I can't believe
I almost told him I loved him.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.711
I can't believe

39:05.744 --> 39:07.913
I did love him.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.815
(sniffles)

39:09.848 --> 39:12.818
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And
just then, she had a thought...

39:12.851 --> 39:14.853
(exhales)

39:14.886 --> 39:17.589
Â¿QuÃ©?

39:19.458 --> 39:21.560
Nothing. I just...

39:21.593 --> 39:24.530
I just realized
I didn't think, after Michael,

39:24.563 --> 39:27.733
I could ever have
my heart broken.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.670
So there's that, at least.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.171
(crying)

39:33.204 --> 39:35.173
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, a small light

39:35.206 --> 39:37.909
at the end of the tunnel
after all.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.647
How's Jane?

39:41.680 --> 39:44.015
She's actually doing okay.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.652
Good.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.887
I wanted to apologize.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.156
I shouldn't have cosigned
their lease.

39:51.189 --> 39:52.524
It's fine.

39:52.558 --> 39:53.391
I know you were

39:53.425 --> 39:55.461
just trying to take care
of your family.

39:55.494 --> 39:58.964
I was. Luckily, Isabel Allende
bought a first edition book,

39:58.997 --> 40:01.700
which paid
for almost all their rent.
Wow.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.068
That's lucky.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.804
NARRATOR:
Or magical.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.707
But you just can't keep doing
these giant things for Jane.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.643
I know. And I had a
breakthrough, actually.

40:11.677 --> 40:14.446
I was talking to Jane,
and it goes back to when

40:14.480 --> 40:17.516
you were pregnant and a small
part of me wondered if you'd

40:17.549 --> 40:19.485
kept the baby,
and that's...
What?!

40:19.518 --> 40:22.187
A very small part.

40:22.220 --> 40:23.522
I just meant

40:23.555 --> 40:25.591
I couldn't rule it out.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.026
Jane wasn't mad.
She understood.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.596
Jane hasn't been beating herself
up for the last five years

40:30.629 --> 40:31.863
since you showed up.

40:31.897 --> 40:34.600
You made me feel so guilty!

40:34.633 --> 40:37.002
NARRATOR: Yeah, not quite
the reaction he was hoping for.

40:37.035 --> 40:38.937
No, no, no, no.
It-it wasn't like that.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.472
I don't want to hear it.
Xo, please...

40:40.506 --> 40:41.573
I need some space.

40:41.607 --> 40:42.541
(keys jangle)

40:45.944 --> 40:47.913
RAFAEL: You look
like you could use a drink.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.548
Thanks.

40:49.581 --> 40:52.183
It's been a little rough
around here.

40:52.217 --> 40:54.720
But I think
I've got my sister handled.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.589
And let's just say I don't think

40:57.623 --> 40:58.524
you're going to be a bartender
forever.

40:58.557 --> 40:59.525
I've been working on...

40:59.558 --> 41:01.126
I don't want
to know the details.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.630
But if anyone can do it,

41:04.663 --> 41:05.731
you can.

41:06.898 --> 41:09.668
(whispers indistinctly)

41:11.670 --> 41:13.238
Stay here.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.544
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Whoa.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.546
She looks
like she's seen a ghost.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.716
EMT: Back away!
EMT 2: Make room!

41:26.084 --> 41:28.153
NARRATOR: I'll give you
a little clue, friends.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.589
She didn't kill herself.
