where it's safe.

16:43.587 --> 16:47.048
Okay, guys, suit yourself.

16:52.596 --> 16:57.392
Like, | think Velma was right, Scoob.
"Suit" yourself.

17:12.449 --> 17:15.952
Like, grab hold, Scoob.

17:25.295 --> 17:30.175
Hmm. Just as | suspected.
Wooden crates. | wonder...

17:30.342 --> 17:33.220
Fred, Velma, Daphne!

17:33.386 --> 17:35.388
VELMA: What made you guys
change your minds?

17:35.555 --> 17:38.141
Like, that web-footed weirdo
paid us a visit...

17:38.308 --> 17:40.685
...but we gave him the slip,
right, Scoob?

17:58.828 --> 18:01.331
This way, Scoob.

18:02.999 --> 18:06.044
Like, | think we're gonna make it.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.171
But then again...

18:18.181 --> 18:20.058
Look, it's the beast.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.437
Quick, get this door open.
We'll trap it inside.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.275
Like, hang on, Scoob.

[CRASHES]

18:32.362 --> 18:34.656
We've got him.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.951
Ah. Like, | guess we showed him.

18:43.623 --> 18:47.210
Oh, no. We've trapped Scooby
and Shaggy with the beast.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.091
Like, Scoob,
| think we just let the lake in.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.282
SCOOBY:
Me too.

19:19.034 --> 19:22.162
It's just about time
for the boss's latest shipment.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.788
Look, here it comes.

Hey, look out.

SHAGGY:
Help!

19:36.801 --> 19:40.638
-Hold on, we're coming.
-Good work, guys.

19:42.057 --> 19:44.392
Nothing to it.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.981
All right, the game is up.

19:51.941 --> 19:55.653
SHAGGY: It's Julie. But, like--?
But, like, why did she do it?

19:55.820 --> 19:57.072
To scare people off...

19:57.238 --> 20:00.575
...while she smuggled the stolen
Klondike gold out of the country.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.912
The stolen gold?
How did you know that?

20:04.079 --> 20:06.247
VELMA: When the Johnson's cat
ran away from her...

20:06.414 --> 20:08.583
...we suspected
she wasn't their daughter.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.961
Then we found a wooden plank
with KL written on it.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.339
The first two letters of "Klondike."

20:14.881 --> 20:17.217
FRED: The gold was taken
to the deserted cabin...

20:17.384 --> 20:20.762
...transported through
a secret passageway down to the lake.

20:20.929 --> 20:25.350
Julie, disguised as the beast,
would swim the loot down to the cavern.

20:25.517 --> 20:29.270
And launch the crates through
the airlock into the underwater tunnel.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.272
FRED:
The pontoons would float the crates...

20:31.439 --> 20:34.192
...and these two would catch them
in a net downstream.

20:34.359 --> 20:37.779
-Scooby, you got one.
-| know, | know.

20:37.946 --> 20:40.907
Since the lake is divided
by the international border...

20:41.074 --> 20:43.284
...the loot would go from Canada
to the U.S...

20:43.451 --> 20:46.538
...without being discovered
at any customs checkpoint.

20:48.665 --> 20:51.709
Yikes, the beast.

20:52.877 --> 20:56.047
But what about this green stuff
we found at the cabin?

20:56.214 --> 20:59.300
Like, I'd say it's just harmless clay.
Right, Scoob?

20:59.467 --> 21:01.553
Right, Shaggy.

[EXPLODES]

21:06.808 --> 21:10.019
Wrong. That was a hunk
of the plastic explosive they used...

21:10.186 --> 21:12.147
...to blast the underwater tunnel.

21:12.313 --> 21:15.275
So the explosions
were the thunder we heard.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.695
And the tunnel was
what caused the lake's level to drop...

21:18.862 --> 21:20.363
...and the river to flood.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.532
And there's some of the stolen gold.

21:22.699 --> 21:26.286

Let's go.

21:27.912 --> 21:31.458
Well, | guess the town and the lake
will start filling up again...

is solved, huh?
