00:06.130 --> 00:09.270
Alex, get ready!
Justin and Zeke are coming.

00:09.300 --> 00:13.100
Ever since Zeke found out about
magic he's been so annoying.

00:13.140 --> 00:15.070
Aww. Now, that's love.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.360
You think he just became annoying.

00:19.800 --> 00:23.040
Zeke, I just told you.
Sometimes we use our wands,

00:23.080 --> 00:25.100
But sometimes we just
wave our hands around.

00:25.140 --> 00:26.840
Why is that so hard to understand?

00:26.870 --> 00:30.740
Gosh, I love how
wizardry plays by its own rules!

00:30.770 --> 00:35.200
Ok, is there, like, a special gland
in your body that secretes magic?

00:35.240 --> 00:37.640
And sometimes it gets all clogged
up, and you have to pop it,

00:37.670 --> 00:40.110
And magic goes everywhere?

00:40.140 --> 00:43.320
Eww. All right, I'm upstairs
if anyone needs me.

00:43.350 --> 00:47.520
Ooh, I wonder if "upstairs"
is code for somewhere wizard-y.

00:47.550 --> 00:48.920
It isn't.

00:48.950 --> 00:52.650
Oh, I wonder if "it isn't"
is code for something wizard-y.

00:52.690 --> 00:54.020
It is.

00:54.060 --> 00:56.660
I knew it!

00:57.990 --> 01:00.860
Zeke, you have to try
to be more like Harper.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.490
When she found out about wizards.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.760
Ok? She didn't have
a hard time with it at all.

01:04.790 --> 01:07.860
That's true, but to be fair,
my circus-like childhood.

01:07.900 --> 01:11.100
Makes the most bizarre things seem normal.

01:11.130 --> 01:14.270
I'm sorry, Justin. It's just
that I have so many questions.

01:14.300 --> 01:17.170
For example, can you cook a hot
dog by sticking it on a wand?

01:17.200 --> 01:20.540
- Zeke! - Can you use magic to turn
me into an alien dog named Kevin?

01:20.570 --> 01:22.940
- Zeke! - Can you use
magic to fix the hair.

01:22.980 --> 01:24.680
That sticks up on the back of my head?

01:24.710 --> 01:27.380
- Oh, wait, we're good today.
- Zeke, enough!

01:27.410 --> 01:30.050
I'll make you a deal.
If you stop bothering me.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.550
With all of these ridiculous questions,

01:32.580 --> 01:35.380
Then I will grant you one magic wish.

01:35.420 --> 01:37.150
- Really?
- Yes.

01:37.220 --> 01:40.460
Ok, then I want to go
back in time into last week,

01:40.490 --> 01:42.630
When I bought this shirt,
to get a green one instead.

01:42.660 --> 01:45.630
- Sounds good.
- Whoo! Yes!

01:45.660 --> 01:49.400
Oh, can you use magic to make me
blow bubbles out of my...?

02:42.750 --> 02:45.390
Ok, mom. Talia and I are
gonna go to the movies.

02:45.420 --> 02:46.960
Oh, really?
What are you guys gonna see?

02:46.990 --> 02:49.260
A love story called
<i>heart of flowers.</i>

02:49.290 --> 02:52.330
It's about two people who appear on
the surface to be totally mismatched,

02:52.360 --> 02:55.300
Only to find out in the end
they're perfect for one another.

02:55.330 --> 02:56.830
It really speaks to us.

02:58.940 --> 03:01.740
Listen, honey, I'm so sorry,
but Max can't go.

03:01.770 --> 03:02.970
He's got chores to do.

03:03.010 --> 03:04.680
But, mom, I could just...

03:04.710 --> 03:07.780
Shh, it's a chick flick.
I'm trying to get you out of it.

03:10.020 --> 03:12.550
I know, and it promises
to be very romantic,

03:12.590 --> 03:15.620
Which is perfect,
because I love romantic things.

03:16.590 --> 03:19.660
Really? [Laughing]

03:19.690 --> 03:21.630
Sweetie, what is going on?

03:21.660 --> 03:23.930
You and talia have nothing in common.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.260
Mom, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.800
Come on, talia.
We have to stop.

03:27.830 --> 03:29.500
And get tissues for when we cry at the end.

03:29.530 --> 03:32.970
The big ones, 'cause I'm feeling
very fragile these days.

03:35.140 --> 03:37.570
You have raised
a wonderful son, Mrs. Russo.

03:37.610 --> 03:41.240
Yeah. And when you see him,
can you send him home?

03:49.250 --> 03:52.190
Dad, dad! Look who
just walked in here!

03:52.220 --> 03:55.160
That's muy macho. That's, like, my
favorite lucha wrestler of all time.

03:55.190 --> 03:59.430
Hey, you're right!
He's one of your biggest heroes.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.870
Get him to sign some of
these cups, and we'll sell 'em.

04:06.940 --> 04:08.800
Oh, I shouldn't!

04:12.640 --> 04:15.640
Hi, excuse me.
You're muy macho, aren't you?

04:15.680 --> 04:18.709
- I'm, like, one of your biggest fans ever.
- Oh, well, thank you!

04:18.750 --> 04:21.450
But you know, nobody really
calls me muy macho anymore.

04:21.480 --> 04:25.490
What do they call you now?
El destroyer-o?

04:25.520 --> 04:29.060
Or, muy bone-crusher-o?

04:30.760 --> 04:32.860
Obviously, I don't speak Spanish.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.130
No, you don't. No.

04:35.170 --> 04:38.700
They call me Bob.
That's my name. Bob macho.

04:38.730 --> 04:41.240
I now own a successful shoe store.

04:41.270 --> 04:42.370
Maybe you've heard about it:

04:42.400 --> 04:45.310
"Bob macho's
successful shoe store."

04:46.580 --> 04:48.210
What? No, no, no.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.610
You can't be a boring shoe salesman.

04:50.650 --> 04:53.250
You're one of the meanest,
toughest luchadores of all time.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.080
I mean, I remember when you made
chimi the changa eat his own beard.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.920
That was the old me.

04:58.950 --> 05:02.860
I've given all that up to be a more
peaceful, constructive citizen.

05:02.890 --> 05:05.560
Why would you do that?

05:05.600 --> 05:08.700
Well, because of what
happened to me ten years ago.

05:08.770 --> 05:11.340
Right in the middle of a match,
I slipped on a churro.

05:11.370 --> 05:14.840
And I fell into the front row of the
crowd, where a little girl unmasked me.

05:14.870 --> 05:16.910
It was the only fight I ever lost,

05:16.940 --> 05:19.540
And the most disgraceful
moment of my career.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.010
Eh, so I retired.

05:23.350 --> 05:25.820
Could you excuse me for one second?

05:26.990 --> 05:29.590
- I can't believe this.
- Me neither.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.260
I mean, what kind of careless parent.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.860
Lets his little girl
go to a wrestling match?

05:34.900 --> 05:36.830
Dad, that careless parent was you,

05:36.860 --> 05:39.130
And that little girl was me.

05:39.170 --> 05:41.470
Don't you remember?

05:49.540 --> 05:51.140
Yeah!

05:51.180 --> 05:54.110
Get him! Ooh, ooh!
My churro!

05:56.000 --> 06:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:03.290 --> 06:04.820
Ay, no!

06:11.930 --> 06:14.570
Wow. And, to think,
all these years,

06:14.600 --> 06:17.000
I've remembered that day as the time.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.240
When I let a perfectly
good churro get away.

06:21.740 --> 06:24.180
Look, Mr. Macho,
I'm so sorry.

06:24.210 --> 06:26.350
That that little girl robbed you
of your true calling.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.480
Oh, you don't have to apologize.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.820
I love my job.

06:29.850 --> 06:33.420
Every time I fit someone's feet,
I make ten new friends.

06:36.220 --> 06:37.490
Yeah, ok, look.

06:37.530 --> 06:40.260
I know that you don't know me,
that we just met,

06:40.290 --> 06:43.060
And I know you say you're happy, but
I think I know what's best for you.

06:43.100 --> 06:46.300
So, how would you like
another shot at wrestling?

06:46.330 --> 06:48.540
- Well, I...
- Alex, what are you doing?

06:48.570 --> 06:52.140
Dad, muy macho lost everything
because of me.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.710
I have to make it up to him.

06:53.740 --> 06:56.540
So... Mr. Macho,
what do you say?

06:56.580 --> 07:00.080
Do you want to taste victory again?

07:00.120 --> 07:05.050
Well... Well, I...
I guess it could be fun.

07:05.090 --> 07:08.720
Although who would get into the ring
with an old washed-up wrestler like me?

07:08.760 --> 07:11.660
- No, no, my dad will do it.
- He will?

07:11.690 --> 07:15.260
Yes. Because he knows how much
it means to his only daughter.

07:16.130 --> 07:17.760
No!

07:19.870 --> 07:22.900
- I'll buy you a churro.
- Ok, I'll do it.

07:24.310 --> 07:27.680
Great! Then it's settled.
The mighty muy macho.

07:27.710 --> 07:31.510
Will return to the ring, so that
he can erase the awful shame.

07:31.550 --> 07:34.320
That has been haunting him
for the past ten years.

07:34.350 --> 07:36.450
- What? I'm not ashamed...
- No...

07:38.790 --> 07:40.890
...Need to thank me.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.890
It's just the kind of
special person that I am.

07:44.930 --> 07:47.660
Mmm. I hope I can find
my lucha mask.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.330
- My dog's been wearing it as pants.
- Ah.

07:54.570 --> 07:56.240
Great news, mom.

07:56.270 --> 07:59.170
Dad is gonna get in the ring
with a famous luchador.

07:59.210 --> 08:01.340
What? Jerry!

08:01.380 --> 08:02.910
I go to the kitchen for five minutes.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.550
And you arrange a fight
with a professional wrestler?

08:05.580 --> 08:07.880
You lose your breath while
cheering for wrestling.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.250
You can be the beautiful ring girl.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.260
Really? You'll be fine, Jerry.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.800
Harper, there you are.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.600
Zeke, what are you doing here?
You already graduated.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.910
I got a job as a crossing guard
so I could be close to you.

08:31.940 --> 08:33.940
In case I freaked out and needed to talk.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.309
Let me guess, you're freaking out.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.450
Yes!

08:39.320 --> 08:41.250
It's this magic wish
that Justin's giving me.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.520
I don't know what to wish for!

08:42.549 --> 08:44.350
Like, what if I wish to live forever,

08:44.390 --> 08:46.360
But then fall into
a dried-up well.

08:46.390 --> 08:47.620
And no one knows where to find me?

08:47.660 --> 08:49.330
I can't live in a dried-up well
forever, Harper!

08:49.360 --> 08:51.130
I just can't!

08:54.230 --> 08:56.970
Maybe you should wish for
a less active imagination.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.400
<i>Attention please.</i>

09:00.440 --> 09:02.710
<i>There's just been</i>
<i>a traffic accident outside.</i>

09:02.740 --> 09:04.570
Unacceptable!

09:04.610 --> 09:06.510
<i>Apparently the crossing guard</i>
<i>left his post.</i>

09:06.540 --> 09:08.780
Honey, now you should be freaking out.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.590
You know, maybe Zeke's right.

09:18.620 --> 09:21.520
Having a wish would be a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.190
How come you never gave me one of those?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.690
Because you hate it when I do magic.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.200
Yeah, but that's because
I never had the opportunity.

09:27.230 --> 09:30.500
- To use it selfishly.
- Selfish?

09:30.530 --> 09:33.400
Aww, I'm such a good role model for you.

09:34.670 --> 09:36.640
All right.
You can have one wish.

09:36.670 --> 09:39.610
Oh, my gosh, really? Oh, I wish I had
more time to think of a good wish.

09:39.640 --> 09:40.970
No! That's not my wish!

09:42.210 --> 09:45.610
I really need to think
about this. Wish me luck.

09:45.650 --> 09:47.380
No, no, no!
That's not it either!

09:48.580 --> 09:51.050
Oh! Oh! No, no, no.

09:53.350 --> 09:54.990
You look really nice today, Max.

09:55.020 --> 09:57.420
I'm so glad I told you to wear that suit.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.220
I agree.

10:00.630 --> 10:02.960
You know, talia, I don't know
what my mom was talking about.

10:02.990 --> 10:04.660
When she said we didn't
have anything in common.

10:04.700 --> 10:07.630
I know. We have tons
of things in common.

10:07.670 --> 10:10.070
- Our love of opera music.
- Yes.

10:10.100 --> 10:13.300
- Brussel sprouts.
- Yum!

10:13.340 --> 10:15.640
Architectural walking tours.

10:16.370 --> 10:17.770
Yay.

10:20.580 --> 10:23.610
You like whatever I like.
It's why we work.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.410
How do we feel about video games?

10:26.450 --> 10:28.250
Oh, we frown upon them.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.590
I was afraid we would say that.

10:38.260 --> 10:42.900
I'm looking for the man
they call Jerry russo!

10:44.470 --> 10:46.240
Hey, look, everybody, it's Bob!

10:46.270 --> 10:47.840
What a great costume!

10:47.870 --> 10:50.110
Stick a roll in it, sandwich maker!

10:50.140 --> 10:52.010
The name is muy macho!

10:52.040 --> 10:54.040
Alex, you were right.

10:54.080 --> 10:58.750
Apparently, I'm not happy being the
owner of a very successful shoe store.

10:58.780 --> 11:01.750
I am, and always have been,
a perfectly chiseled.

11:01.790 --> 11:04.650
Fighting machine with no
conscience whatsoever!

11:05.960 --> 11:09.260
- Muy macho is back!
- That's right!

11:09.290 --> 11:13.100
In the ring, reducing grown men.

11:13.130 --> 11:16.000
To sniveling shells of their former selves!

11:23.740 --> 11:27.380
Ok, just so you know,
that means he's really angry.

11:30.850 --> 11:33.420
He just tore a phone book in half!

11:33.450 --> 11:36.290
I am not fighting him!
I could get hurt.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.820
Dad, dad, if you don't
fight him, he can't win.

11:39.860 --> 11:41.490
How am I gonna make up
for what I did to him?

11:41.520 --> 11:42.790
But...

11:44.890 --> 11:47.900
I will fight muy macho!

11:52.030 --> 11:54.770
Zeke, what in the world
are you talking about?

11:54.800 --> 11:57.300
I'm talking about fulfilling
a lifelong dream of mine:

11:57.340 --> 11:58.510
To fight a mexican wrestler.

11:58.540 --> 12:01.040
I also had one to become
a professional magician,

12:01.080 --> 12:03.380
But we all know how that turned out.

12:05.110 --> 12:07.980
I will see you in the ring, kid.

12:08.020 --> 12:11.520
Where I will make you hurt
worse than a bunion.

12:11.550 --> 12:15.820
That has resulted
from ill-fitting shoes!

12:28.700 --> 12:30.370
You sure you know what you're doing, buddy?

12:30.410 --> 12:33.170
Yes, yes, he's sure.
He said it, right? Thank you, Zeke.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.110
Ok? The match
will go on as planned.

12:35.140 --> 12:37.680
Dad, don't worry, it'll be all good.

12:37.710 --> 12:40.750
'cause see, muy macho will beat
Zeke, my conscience will be clear,

12:40.780 --> 12:42.580
And I can get rid of this
haunting flashback.

12:44.150 --> 12:45.790
No, stop it!

12:47.420 --> 12:49.690
I've decided on my wish.

12:49.730 --> 12:52.830
I want you to make me a great luchador.

12:52.860 --> 12:55.100
That nice man with the heavy accent.

12:55.130 --> 12:57.730
Will regret ever coming out of retirement!

12:57.770 --> 13:00.300
Why are you talking like that?

13:00.340 --> 13:03.140
This is my wrestler voice!

13:03.170 --> 13:04.970
I thought it was obvious.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.310
Oh, jeez!

13:11.420 --> 13:12.520
I don't know about this, Zeke.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.690
Fighting muy macho could be dangerous.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.760
Not with magic.
I can't lose.

13:17.790 --> 13:20.290
Plus, I already got my cool
wrestling name all picked out:

13:20.330 --> 13:24.030
Lava sus manos!

13:25.370 --> 13:26.870
That means
"wash your hands."

13:28.740 --> 13:30.270
Oh, that makes sense.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.600
I read it on a sign in the men's bathroom.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.280
All right. If that is your wish,
then you got it.

13:37.310 --> 13:39.410
Whoo! Thank you, my friend!

13:59.840 --> 14:01.900
Hey, guys!

14:01.940 --> 14:04.410
Are you coming to the lucha match tonight?

14:04.440 --> 14:06.010
I don't know if you've heard,
but there's gonna be like.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.480
A really beautiful ring girl there.

14:08.510 --> 14:10.580
Oh, no way, I love lucha wrestling!

14:10.610 --> 14:13.220
- I know.
- No, you don't, Max.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.720
It's barbaric.

14:16.220 --> 14:19.790
You're right, I never
thought of it that way.

14:19.820 --> 14:21.820
It's barbaric.

14:23.590 --> 14:25.730
As you can tell,
Mrs. Russo,

14:25.760 --> 14:27.660
Max and I are into cute things,

14:27.700 --> 14:29.930
Like making a snowman out of cotton balls.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.970
And dressing up kittens
to look like famous people.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.300
- Uh-huh.
- Really?

14:35.340 --> 14:40.080
That doesn't sound like you, Max.

14:40.110 --> 14:41.540
Is it true?

14:44.580 --> 14:47.050
No. No, it's not true.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.650
You know what?

14:49.680 --> 14:52.590
Talia, I can't do this anymore.

14:52.620 --> 14:56.390
I don't like chick flicks
and I don't like opera music.

14:56.430 --> 15:00.300
And I only like dressing up
kittens in little dog costumes.

15:01.830 --> 15:03.400
What are you saying?

15:04.670 --> 15:07.440
I'm saying my mom was right.

15:07.470 --> 15:10.870
We have nothing
in common... Whatsoever.

15:12.540 --> 15:14.480
We should probably break up.

15:14.510 --> 15:17.350
In fact, you should probably leave before
you catch a glimpse of the real me,

15:17.380 --> 15:19.780
Because it's super gross.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.490
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

15:33.530 --> 15:36.230
And welcome to tonight's main event!

15:36.270 --> 15:39.800
Making his triumphant return to the ring,

15:39.840 --> 15:45.370
We have the legendary luchador, muy macho!

15:54.120 --> 15:56.250
Alex, it is not in my character.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.290
To offer you a heartfelt thanks.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.920
For giving me this second chance.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.790
So, I will simply say...
I will not destroy you!

16:04.960 --> 16:08.060
Aww. That's what makes
this all worthwhile.

16:09.970 --> 16:14.370
And in this corner,
wearing a chicken costume.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.170
That doesn't match his name,

16:16.210 --> 16:22.540
We have the challenger, lava sus manos!

16:28.880 --> 16:32.020
Are you ready for some lucha wrestling?

16:37.730 --> 16:40.900
All right, Zeke, this is your one wish.

16:40.930 --> 16:43.930
Let's... Make the best of it.

16:45.100 --> 16:48.740
Lucha ba boom!

16:48.770 --> 16:50.540
Well? How do you feel?

16:50.580 --> 16:54.950
I feel like lava sus manos is
about to get his hands dirty!

16:55.810 --> 16:56.910
That's great.

17:16.900 --> 17:20.240
Justin, what's going on
with Zeke? Why is he winning?

17:20.270 --> 17:23.040
I put a spell on him to make him
a wrestler. That was his wish.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.540
What?!

17:24.579 --> 17:27.619
Smell your own foot, shoe salesman!

17:29.920 --> 17:33.620
Why did you convince me to do this, Alex?

17:33.660 --> 17:35.360
This is even more humiliating.

17:35.390 --> 17:37.490
Than being unmasked by a little girl!

17:40.930 --> 17:42.200
Don't worry, muy macho!

17:42.230 --> 17:43.660
I'm not gonna let you lose again!

17:46.630 --> 17:48.630
Lucha ba boom.
But stronger!

17:51.970 --> 17:54.240
Oh...

18:09.050 --> 18:12.260
Justin?
What's going on?!

18:14.630 --> 18:17.260
I guess you should have asked
to be an unbeatable luchador.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.360
Magic is very specific like that.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.630
Just...
Just get out of there!

18:21.670 --> 18:23.730
I can't!
I need another wish!

18:23.770 --> 18:25.970
All I can give you is advice.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.770
Don't fight! Go limp!
Go limp! It works for me!

18:34.280 --> 18:35.810
Hey, this is great, huh?

18:39.680 --> 18:40.620
Talia?

18:40.650 --> 18:42.990
What are you doing here?

18:43.020 --> 18:45.620
I came to apologize
for the way I was treating you.

18:45.660 --> 18:49.090
And try to experience something
you actually like for once.

18:49.130 --> 18:50.900
I'm having a lot of fun.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.830
This is just like that
chick flick, <i>heart of flowers.</i>

18:53.870 --> 18:57.130
I'm the sloppy maid and
you're the stuffy rich guy.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.300
In the end, we learn to appreciate
each other's differences.

18:59.340 --> 19:02.640
And live the rest of our lives
together in an old beach house.

19:02.670 --> 19:05.410
I'll always be your stuffy rich guy, Max.

19:06.140 --> 19:07.310
Aww.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.150
Oh, help!

19:13.180 --> 19:15.520
Come on, muy macho!
Take him down!

19:17.050 --> 19:19.690
Oh, my gosh, Alex! I've finally
figured out my one wish!

19:19.720 --> 19:23.260
World peace!
Pretty good, huh?

19:23.300 --> 19:25.260
Yeah, yeah, Harper.
That's great, ok? Here you go.

19:25.300 --> 19:28.600
Mommy!

19:28.630 --> 19:30.130
Oh, my gosh, Zeke's in trouble.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.700
Alex, you have to help him.

19:31.740 --> 19:34.170
I can't help him.
Muy macho has to win.

19:34.210 --> 19:36.140
Why does muy macho have to win?

19:36.180 --> 19:38.740
It's a long story. Maybe this
flashback will help you understand.

19:45.550 --> 19:47.120
Ay, no!

19:53.090 --> 19:55.190
You can show people your flashbacks?

19:55.230 --> 19:56.560
Yeah, I find it's quicker that way.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.960
Wasn't I cute back then?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.860
All right, I see your problem.

19:59.900 --> 20:02.730
But that doesn't change the fact that
Zeke is getting destroyed up there.

20:02.770 --> 20:06.070
Ow! Going limp
makes it worse!

20:07.840 --> 20:09.740
If you're not gonna help,
I want to change my wish.

20:09.770 --> 20:12.310
Forget world peace.
I want to beat muy macho senseless.

20:12.340 --> 20:14.040
For hurting my man.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.610
Harper, really? I mean...
Really, do you want to do that?

20:17.650 --> 20:19.480
World peace kinda sounds awesome.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.890
That is my wish!
Do it now!

20:24.620 --> 20:25.890
Ok.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.760
Sorry, muy macho.

20:28.790 --> 20:30.530
Lucha ba boom, muy macho's doomed.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.900
- I'm coming, Zeke!
- Hurry!

20:51.980 --> 20:53.380
One, two, three!

20:53.420 --> 20:55.720
We have a winner!

21:05.290 --> 21:06.930
And what's your wrestling name?

21:06.960 --> 21:10.330
Whatever the Spanish word is
for "crazy, red-headed chick!"

21:12.200 --> 21:13.800
I can't be certain, Jerry,

21:13.840 --> 21:16.400
But I think all these people
are cheering for me.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.990
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry, muy macho.

21:28.030 --> 21:31.790
- I can't believe this happened again.
- I know. I'm terrible.

21:31.830 --> 21:35.670
That scrawny kid and that girl beat me.

21:35.700 --> 21:39.000
I obviously have no business
being a wrestler.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.340
No, I think you should try again.
I think you can take that girl.

21:41.370 --> 21:45.610
No, Alex, I realized
that I am perfectly happy.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.480
Being a successful shoe salesman.

21:48.910 --> 21:52.180
- So you're saying I
actually helped you? - No!

21:52.210 --> 21:54.350
This was the worst experience of my life!

21:54.380 --> 21:57.820
I'll never forgive you,
Alex russo. Never!

22:03.320 --> 22:06.960
Well...
You did what you could.

22:06.990 --> 22:09.830
You had the best intentions.
Just forget about it.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.300
This was the worst experience of my life!

22:18.340 --> 22:21.370
I'll never forgive you,
Alex russo. Never!

22:25.750 --> 22:28.220
Great. A new flashback.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.350
Ay, no!
