00:04.019 --> 00:05.480
<i>I'll be gone in a week.</i>

00:05.480 --> 00:06.730
Your mother'll miss you.

00:06.730 --> 00:08.650
- Taking her with me, Alan.
- What?

00:08.650 --> 00:10.190
<i>She barely knows
what year it is.</i>

00:10.190 --> 00:12.070
Take off your shoes.
You know your father

00:12.070 --> 00:14.030
won't abide
any click-clacks in the house.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.620
<i>They call it sundownin'.</i>

00:15.620 --> 00:17.450
<i>Nights are hard for your mom.</i>

00:23.540 --> 00:24.870
<i>Warden Lacy,</i>

00:24.870 --> 00:28.250
he told me the Devil was a boy,

00:28.250 --> 00:30.460
and old Dale said he caught him.

00:30.460 --> 00:33.170
<i>Had locked the Devil in a box.</i>

00:33.170 --> 00:36.140
<i>To put an end to all
the horrors we've seen,</i>

00:36.140 --> 00:38.050
<i>that's what God told me.</i>

00:38.050 --> 00:39.680
How long ago was this?

00:39.680 --> 00:41.470
<i>Don't let
that fuckin' kid out.</i>

00:41.470 --> 00:43.230
Is it time to call Pruitt?

00:43.230 --> 00:46.310
Hey! I can be your lawyer
if you want me to be.

00:46.310 --> 00:48.520
- But you have to say it.
<i>- We're both</i>

00:48.520 --> 00:49.610
gettin' out of this shithole.

01:00.950 --> 01:02.450
Sit the fuck

01:11.210 --> 01:12.210
<i>I'm gonna read you</i>

01:12.210 --> 01:14.380
<i>a list of five words.</i>

01:14.380 --> 01:16.880
I'm gonna ask you to repeat them
in any order.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.350
Once now, and then again
in a few minutes.

01:20.350 --> 01:21.430
You ready?

01:23.430 --> 01:27.270
Boat, family, church,

01:27.270 --> 01:30.940
dog, white.

01:30.940 --> 01:34.530
Boat, white, church...

01:34.530 --> 01:36.530
dog...

01:36.530 --> 01:37.910
family.

02:16.530 --> 02:18.450
You okay?

02:18.450 --> 02:19.450
Yeah.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.790
I'm not supposed
to tell you this, but...

02:29.790 --> 02:33.090
your scan looks clear. To me.

02:33.090 --> 02:35.000
Doctor Green will walk through
your results.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.220
So, what is it?

02:38.220 --> 02:40.720
Do you listen to loud music
in your earbuds?

02:40.720 --> 02:43.390
It could just be tinnitus.

02:43.390 --> 02:45.850
- Do you hear it right now?
- Comes and goes.

02:45.850 --> 02:48.230
Used to bother me
when I was a teenager.

02:49.730 --> 02:51.230
Where you from?

02:51.230 --> 02:52.860
I know you're not a Texan.

02:52.860 --> 02:54.730
New Yorker.

02:54.730 --> 02:56.150
Maine.

02:56.150 --> 02:57.990
That's nice.

02:57.990 --> 02:59.950
Flat houses, snow on Christmas.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.570
Yeah.

03:02.570 --> 03:03.830
Not exactly.

03:03.830 --> 03:05.160
You get back there much?

03:06.870 --> 03:07.750
No.

03:10.830 --> 03:12.580
I guess everyone thinks
they grew up

03:12.580 --> 03:13.790
in the worst place
on earth, huh?

03:20.590 --> 03:21.970
<i>Five days
after the massacre,</i>

03:21.970 --> 03:24.640
<i>we still have so few answers.</i>

03:24.640 --> 03:26.930
<i>Why did the much-liked
corrections officer</i>

03:26.930 --> 03:28.560
<i>unleash on his fellow guards?</i>

03:28.560 --> 03:30.270
<i>Along with the shocking...</i>

03:30.270 --> 03:31.770
<i>Privatizing
of the prison,</i>

03:31.770 --> 03:33.770
<i>along with the suicide
of its beloved warden,</i>

03:33.770 --> 03:36.320
<i>the tragedies at Shawshank
keep piling up.</i>

03:36.320 --> 03:37.860
<i>In other news, the wildfires</i>

03:37.860 --> 03:40.490
<i>continue to spread across
Black Mountain,</i>

03:40.490 --> 03:42.530
<i>engulfing as many as 200 acres.</i>

03:42.530 --> 03:44.990
<i>Firefighting teams from across
the state are pitching in,</i>

03:44.990 --> 03:48.160
<i>but the residents of dozens
of houses between Castle View</i>

03:48.160 --> 03:52.210
<i>and Castle Lake
have already been evacuated.</i>

03:58.130 --> 03:59.670
I know. I already had
a hearing scheduled.

03:59.670 --> 04:03.130
They pushed it
three weeks after...

04:03.130 --> 04:05.010
That's what I'm trying to tell...
Look, look...

04:05.010 --> 04:07.010
I-I left two messages
with the judge.

04:07.010 --> 04:09.560
I have a client who's stuck
in Shawshank, and I...

04:09.560 --> 04:11.180
Hello?

04:11.180 --> 04:13.900
Fuck!

04:13.900 --> 04:16.230
Sorry, Father.

04:16.230 --> 04:18.230
- Thanks for coming down.
- Yeah, sorry for the delay.

04:18.230 --> 04:19.690
Um...

04:19.690 --> 04:21.779
I spoke to the cemetery,
they said they should

04:21.779 --> 04:23.110
have a plot for my dad
ready by tomorrow.

04:23.110 --> 04:24.240
That's not why I called.

04:49.850 --> 04:53.100
It's called
exploding casket syndrome.

04:53.100 --> 04:57.940
Uh, when there's no oxygen
to dehydrate the... contents,

04:57.940 --> 05:02.360
the casket
becomes a pressure cooker.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.320
Wouldn't think remains this old
would be susceptible, but,

05:05.320 --> 05:07.910
maybe when they resealed
the casket for transport...

05:07.910 --> 05:10.700
Are you all right?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.540
Of course, with
the recent trouble at Shawshank,

05:18.540 --> 05:22.960
there is a bit of a queue,
if you still want a service.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.840
<i>Let me understand this.</i>

05:25.840 --> 05:27.840
<i>You found
the Count of Monte Cristo</i>

05:27.840 --> 05:30.140
<i>in a septic tank.</i>

05:30.140 --> 05:32.220
<i>He asks for his lawyer,
lawyer shows up,</i>

05:32.220 --> 05:34.680
<i>you stiff-arm the guy
to cover your ass,</i>

05:34.680 --> 05:38.310
<i>one of our own guards
doesn't like this miscarriage</i>

05:38.310 --> 05:40.690
<i>of justice, not one bit,</i>

05:40.690 --> 05:42.440
<i>so he does
the only logical thing</i>

05:42.440 --> 05:44.940
<i>and pumps two clips
into his coworkers.</i>

05:44.940 --> 05:48.490
<i>And voila!
Our very own Times alert.</i>

05:48.490 --> 05:51.950
<i>And yeah, I'd like to take
a moment of silence,</i>

05:51.950 --> 05:54.410
<i>mourn the dead,
be human for a change,</i>

05:54.410 --> 05:56.620
<i>I really would, but I can't</i>

05:56.620 --> 05:59.580
<i>because I'm so busy
getting fucked in the ass</i>

05:59.580 --> 06:02.340
<i>by your incompetence.</i>

06:02.340 --> 06:04.420
<i>I don't care if you make him
vanish into thin air</i>

06:04.420 --> 06:07.090
<i>like Harry fuckin' Houdini,
I don't care if you bury him</i>

06:07.090 --> 06:09.800
<i>under the yard or buy him
a ticket to Mallorca...</i>

06:09.800 --> 06:12.680
<i>Whatever happens in there,
however it gets handled,</i>

06:12.680 --> 06:16.600
<i>I knew nothing.
The board knew nothing.</i>

06:16.600 --> 06:19.850
<i>And if things go wrong, Theresa,</i>

06:19.850 --> 06:21.900
<i>there's always room
under the bus</i>

06:21.900 --> 06:24.190
<i>for one more rogue employee.</i>

06:38.500 --> 06:39.870
<i>Front door open.</i>

06:39.870 --> 06:42.040
Who the fuck's that?

06:42.040 --> 06:43.710
New system.

06:43.710 --> 06:45.550
So we can keep an eye on Mom.

06:47.170 --> 06:48.720
Both doors are rigged.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.640
Had to get creative
with the cameras.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.600
Four upstairs and four down.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.010
As soon as I'm done
at Shawshank, I'm leaving.

06:55.010 --> 06:57.020
Meantime, we can both
keep an eye on her

06:57.020 --> 06:58.350
with a smartphone app.

07:01.600 --> 07:05.270
Listen, until we figure out
the long-term situation,

07:05.270 --> 07:06.690
I need to know she's safe.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.860
Why not just put a chip in her,

07:09.860 --> 07:12.320
like a golden retriever?

07:16.950 --> 07:18.160
Hello?

07:19.620 --> 07:20.670
Wait, what?

07:25.040 --> 07:26.550
How soon?

07:36.310 --> 07:39.600
<i>Three challenges will
face you, the newly paroled,</i>

07:39.600 --> 07:41.890
<i>as you reenter society.</i>

07:41.890 --> 07:44.020
<i>What do I do?
Where will I live?</i>

07:44.020 --> 07:47.820
<i>And, finally, who will I be?</i>

07:47.820 --> 07:51.700
<i>The good news is, you can be
almost anyone you want to be</i>

07:51.700 --> 07:54.280
<i>if you adapt
to your new surroundings.</i>

07:54.280 --> 07:57.790
<i>You will face questions
about your time in prison.</i>

07:57.790 --> 08:00.120
<i>When you meet
a potential employer,</i>

08:00.120 --> 08:02.460
<i>a potential landlord,
or even a new friend,</i>

08:02.460 --> 08:06.380
<i>don't be afraid to reframe
your narrative.</i>

08:06.380 --> 08:09.170
<i>The person you were
when you went in,</i>

08:09.170 --> 08:12.050
<i>that's not the person
walking out today.</i>

08:12.050 --> 08:14.180
<i>You can tell your own story,</i>

08:14.180 --> 08:16.470
<i>be your own hero,</i>

08:16.470 --> 08:19.100
<i>choose the life
you want to live.</i>

08:20.560 --> 08:24.650
<i>I'm Lou Hadley, who are you?</i>

09:00.140 --> 09:02.730
Look at that.

09:02.730 --> 09:04.060
Free man.

09:10.780 --> 09:12.940
There's a burn
on Black Mountain.

09:12.940 --> 09:14.360
State uses inmates
during fire season.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.570
Why don't we...

09:16.570 --> 09:18.870
Why don't we start from scratch?

09:18.870 --> 09:20.280
I'm Henry.

09:27.330 --> 09:30.800
I'm... I'm just asking your name.

10:08.210 --> 10:12.630
"Make thee an ark of gopherwood,

10:12.630 --> 10:17.470
and this is the fashion
thou shalt make it of."

10:25.470 --> 10:29.060
So I built my ark...

10:31.650 --> 10:34.190
and when his voice
came into my dreams

10:34.190 --> 10:36.690
for six nights in a row,

10:36.690 --> 10:41.240
he told me exactly where
he would stand at the quarry.

10:41.240 --> 10:46.160
The reason, the stain,
the curse on our town,

10:46.160 --> 10:49.210
dragging evil behind you
everywhere you went.

10:52.790 --> 10:54.420
And when I brought you
down here,

10:54.420 --> 10:59.340
I was on fire with the Holy Spirit,

10:59.340 --> 11:02.300
righteous, and so strong.

11:04.390 --> 11:06.220
And-and you looked...

11:08.730 --> 11:12.150
you looked so small next to my faith.

11:19.070 --> 11:20.990
And now...

11:22.870 --> 11:25.530
now you still look small.

11:26.870 --> 11:28.540
But I look old.

11:31.620 --> 11:33.210
I am old.

11:34.340 --> 11:36.500
After all these years,

11:36.500 --> 11:39.470
I still don't know
what you really are

11:39.470 --> 11:41.630
or if I did the right thing.

12:22.340 --> 12:24.130
Do you remember that crazy story

12:24.130 --> 12:25.930
you told me
your first night in here?

12:43.530 --> 12:44.990
Face.

12:48.490 --> 12:50.450
No face.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.830
Face.

12:55.460 --> 12:56.790
Face.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.090
<i>Pure retrograde amnesia.</i>

13:02.090 --> 13:04.470
No sign of impairment
to the short-term memory

13:04.470 --> 13:06.760
or structural damage
to the brain.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.350
A purely emotional phenomenon.

13:09.350 --> 13:11.310
Now I'm going to read you
a list of five words,

13:11.310 --> 13:14.140
I'm going to ask you
to repeat them to me

13:14.140 --> 13:16.060
in any order.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.060
Ready?

13:18.520 --> 13:21.570
Face, velvet, church,

13:21.570 --> 13:22.990
family, red.

13:25.780 --> 13:28.910
Face, velvet, red,

13:28.910 --> 13:31.200
church, family.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.660
So, uh...

13:36.250 --> 13:37.580
how do you treat it?

13:37.580 --> 13:38.960
There's no magic bullet.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.750
Sometimes it's
a gradual process,

13:40.750 --> 13:43.760
other cases, you put someone
back in their own home

13:43.760 --> 13:45.470
with their own junk
and it's just like

13:45.470 --> 13:46.630
flipping a light switch.

13:48.470 --> 13:50.140
Best medicine's to get him home.

13:50.140 --> 13:52.560
Restore the context,
restore the memories.

13:57.230 --> 13:59.020
But don't push it.

13:59.020 --> 14:00.940
These things take time.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.360
Oh, no, no.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.490
No, I'm just his lawyer.

14:04.490 --> 14:07.360
I brought him here so you all
could take care of him.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.660
Well, we're not
an inpatient facility.

14:09.660 --> 14:11.740
I could pull some strings
at Juniper Hill,

14:11.740 --> 14:14.240
might be able to get him
a bed by Monday.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.540
By Monday?

14:16.540 --> 14:18.710
<i>What's he supposed to do
until Monday?</i>

14:22.500 --> 14:25.380
So the bathroom
is back that way,

14:25.380 --> 14:28.590
there's no shower,
just don't drink the water.

14:34.220 --> 14:36.810
You should really
stay in here this weekend, OK?

14:36.810 --> 14:38.520
Nobody in town knows you're out.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.480
Let's keep it that way.

14:45.780 --> 14:47.320
I don't think
this is a good idea.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.200
I appreciate you
trying to help, but...

14:52.200 --> 14:54.030
He needs a place to sleep,

14:54.030 --> 14:56.500
and I've got one.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.350
Look, we have no idea who he is.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.270
He could be
the Bangor Strangler.

15:20.270 --> 15:22.350
First of all, you made that up.

15:22.350 --> 15:24.980
Second, you're the one
who got him out of prison.

15:24.980 --> 15:27.230
Yeah, because I believe
in due process.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.070
Doesn't mean I want him

15:29.070 --> 15:30.400
bunking up with my...

15:31.530 --> 15:33.070
friend.

15:35.330 --> 15:37.200
Listen,
I'll feel a whole lot better

15:37.200 --> 15:38.370
once he's out of your hair.

15:39.870 --> 15:42.250
And I'm out of this town.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.000
I'm gonna drive him up
to the hospital tomorrow

15:44.000 --> 15:44.920
and check on that wait-list.

16:07.230 --> 16:09.400
<i>Front door open.</i>

16:22.960 --> 16:25.170
Ruth, you shouldn't
have waited up for me.

16:25.170 --> 16:27.790
Where in God's name
have you been?

16:27.790 --> 16:30.380
He's got a fever.
You're gonna kill him out there.

16:32.550 --> 16:33.680
Ruthie...

16:36.470 --> 16:39.060
Let me take you back to bed.

16:39.060 --> 16:41.640
Everything's gonna be fine.

16:43.020 --> 16:44.940
You're just having a bad night.

16:46.810 --> 16:48.190
No.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.820
Something terrible's
gonna happen.

18:56.150 --> 18:59.030
- Yay! Good job!
- Yay!

18:59.030 --> 19:00.700
Nice job, buddy.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.910
Big brother's birthday!
Look. Ready?

19:02.910 --> 19:06.450
All right. Now, do you
want an end piece or...

19:06.450 --> 19:08.410
End piece, please.

19:08.410 --> 19:10.120
- Ready?
- There you go, buddy.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.460
- Open your presents?
- Yes!

19:18.010 --> 19:20.260
- I wonder...
- Of course you do,

19:20.260 --> 19:21.890
- because I bought it.
- Jesus, Angela,

19:21.890 --> 19:23.300
not in front of the kids.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.850
Mommy,
don't get mad today.

19:24.850 --> 19:26.350
- Yeah, Mommy.
- I'm sick of this.

19:26.350 --> 19:28.350
- Gordy, open your presents!
- Mom!

19:28.350 --> 19:29.730
Go to your room, Gordy.
Your mom and I have to talk.

19:29.730 --> 19:31.100
No. Gordy,
open your present.

19:32.980 --> 19:34.820
- There! It's open now!
- Daddy opened it.

19:34.820 --> 19:37.150
A baseball glove!
How fuckin' original, Mommy!

19:37.150 --> 19:39.030
- Go to your room, Gordy.
- Don't touch me.

19:39.030 --> 19:40.700
You're the one who has
to make today about you, huh?

19:40.700 --> 19:42.280
- Just shut up.
- Or what, Angela?!

19:42.280 --> 19:44.160
What are you gonna do?

19:44.160 --> 19:45.700
- I'll stuff this fuckin' cake down your throat.
- No, Daddy!

19:45.700 --> 19:47.410
I'm gonna kill
you some day.

19:47.410 --> 19:49.330
Why not today? Huh?
Happy birthday, son.

19:49.330 --> 19:50.870
Say it again,
I'll cut you open right now,

19:50.870 --> 19:52.870
- you son of a bitch.
- Why not today?

19:55.670 --> 19:58.090
Gordy, run!

19:58.090 --> 20:01.260
Get off me!

20:30.620 --> 20:32.080
<i>As the blaze continues to engulf</i>

20:32.080 --> 20:33.210
<i>more and more acres of forest,</i>

20:33.210 --> 20:34.710
<i>Castle County Fire Department</i>

20:34.710 --> 20:36.630
<i>still can't explain how it began</i>

20:36.630 --> 20:39.090
<i>or why traditional methods
to extinguish the fire</i>

20:39.090 --> 20:40.380
<i>aren't working.</i>

20:40.380 --> 20:41.720
<i>The unusually quick spread</i>

20:41.720 --> 20:43.340
<i>has many convinced</i>

20:43.340 --> 20:45.470
<i>it's a harbinger
of much worse to come.</i>

20:45.470 --> 20:48.350
<i>And now,
back to the hits you love.</i>

21:03.400 --> 21:04.910
Lady on the internet

21:04.910 --> 21:07.070
said they were made by Vikings,

21:07.070 --> 21:08.240
so I figured...

21:08.240 --> 21:10.700
Oh! The Lewis chessmen?

21:11.910 --> 21:13.580
Oh!

21:13.580 --> 21:15.000
You know, the originals,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.710
they were carved
out of walrus ivory

21:17.710 --> 21:19.500
by the wife of a priest,

21:19.500 --> 21:22.210
Margret the Adroit.

21:22.210 --> 21:24.590
You're still the smartest person
I know.

21:24.590 --> 21:27.510
Well, smart enough to know
what you're up to.

21:27.510 --> 21:29.850
Come on, girl. Come on.

21:29.850 --> 21:31.810
What else did the internet
teach you?

21:33.600 --> 21:35.730
Chess is good
for the demented brain?

22:27.320 --> 22:28.320
Hello?

22:37.620 --> 22:39.460
Hello?

24:02.790 --> 24:07.050
The rabbit goes...

24:07.050 --> 24:08.420
into the hole.

24:08.420 --> 24:10.970
No, the fox chases the rabbit.

24:10.970 --> 24:13.970
Oh, please.
What's the difference?

24:13.970 --> 24:17.390
One's a carnivore,
the other's breakfast.

24:17.390 --> 24:19.770
God, I haven't had a tie on

24:19.770 --> 24:22.060
since the day
I turned in my badge.

24:22.060 --> 24:24.060
Mm. You're so sweet.

24:24.060 --> 24:26.980
It's not sweet
I can't tie my tie.

24:26.980 --> 24:28.650
It's arthritis.

24:28.650 --> 24:31.650
Oh, the speech.

24:31.650 --> 24:35.320
You tossed and turned all night.
That's what kept you up.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.370
There's no shame in it, Alan.

24:39.450 --> 24:41.660
Stage fright'll jelly up anyone,

24:41.660 --> 24:43.670
even an Adonis like you.

24:43.670 --> 24:45.830
You'll do fine, you'll do fine.

24:45.830 --> 24:48.800
Just picture me naked.

24:54.590 --> 24:56.430
God, I love you.

25:02.270 --> 25:04.230
Uh...

25:06.060 --> 25:08.570
I, uh, just need to borrow
the car a few hours.

25:08.570 --> 25:11.650
Oh, sure. You can take it
after Alan's ceremony.

25:11.650 --> 25:13.820
- I wasn't planning on going.
- It's OK, he doesn't have to.

25:13.820 --> 25:15.530
I wasn't askin'.

25:32.340 --> 25:34.170
Now, before we get started,

25:34.170 --> 25:37.840
please join me in a moment
of silence for our fallen heroes

25:37.840 --> 25:39.180
at Shawshank.

25:51.110 --> 25:52.860
I wanna testify.

25:58.620 --> 26:00.910
Thank you.

26:00.910 --> 26:01.950
Well...

26:03.500 --> 26:05.120
Pangborn Bridge.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.420
Get used to the sound of that.

26:09.420 --> 26:11.840
Here's a man
who has served this county

26:11.840 --> 26:15.340
with honor for decades,

26:15.340 --> 26:18.890
who saw us through some of
our most challenging times...

26:20.260 --> 26:23.260
who never asked
for anything in return,

26:23.260 --> 26:26.350
even when he faced his own
tremendous challenges.

26:28.350 --> 26:30.730
A man who epitomizes
the very soul

26:30.730 --> 26:32.650
of the great town
of Castle Rock.

26:32.650 --> 26:35.240
A man that needs
no introduction from me.

26:35.240 --> 26:36.950
Alan Pangborn, everybody.

26:46.910 --> 26:48.670
I guess I oughta
thank the wildfire

26:48.670 --> 26:51.250
for smoking you all
out of your houses.

26:53.880 --> 26:54.840
Um...

26:56.510 --> 27:00.390
I wanted to be a magician
when I was a kid.

27:00.390 --> 27:04.350
They always seemed to have a
lovely assistant hanging around.

27:06.180 --> 27:10.150
But, a magician
has to tell a little story.

27:10.150 --> 27:13.020
Something to distract you
while they...

27:14.230 --> 27:16.480
palm an ace off the deck.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.700
I was never any good at that.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.570
Never any good at the patter.

27:20.570 --> 27:23.410
And...

27:24.580 --> 27:26.040
Quiet!

27:27.870 --> 27:31.080
If I've done any good
in this town...

27:32.630 --> 27:34.790
If I've done any good,
it's because

27:34.790 --> 27:39.050
of the gift of faith
you people have given me.

27:39.050 --> 27:41.720
Good people.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.600
I just hope I've left
Castle County a little better

27:44.600 --> 27:47.430
than I found it.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.680
Ruth?

27:50.940 --> 27:51.900
Ruth!

27:55.320 --> 27:56.190
Mom!

28:02.660 --> 28:04.490
Oh, no! Somebody help!

28:14.750 --> 28:16.170
Hey.

28:16.170 --> 28:17.300
I'm back.

28:26.930 --> 28:28.390
Hello?

29:11.140 --> 29:16.060
Hey, I don't know where you are,
but I thought I should tell you,

29:16.060 --> 29:19.070
the kid, um, wandered off.

29:19.070 --> 29:22.490
So, call me when you get this.

29:24.900 --> 29:26.950
Okay, so then
the next-door neighbors

29:26.950 --> 29:28.910
got gassed in their house.

29:28.910 --> 29:32.080
Just a freak accident,
supposedly.

29:32.080 --> 29:35.540
Cracked furnace case.
They all died in their sleep

29:35.540 --> 29:38.000
on Christmas Eve.
Shit you not.

29:42.340 --> 29:44.300
Lined up the body bags
right on the lawn.

29:45.430 --> 29:46.630
Plus the dog and cat.

29:46.630 --> 29:48.760
This is before I was born.

29:48.760 --> 29:51.600
Just like everything interesting
that's ever happened here.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.730
I mean, they say
write what you know,

29:58.730 --> 30:00.690
but this town is so blah.

30:00.690 --> 30:03.480
I mean, people bitch
about the bad old days

30:03.480 --> 30:05.280
when there were, like,
serial killers

30:05.280 --> 30:09.820
and psychopathic dogs,
but I would give my left tit

30:09.820 --> 30:12.160
to go back there.

30:12.160 --> 30:13.620
The eighties, man.

30:18.210 --> 30:19.790
I had this uncle, though.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.840
He was a writer, too.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.920
And then, one winter,
he just flipped his lid

30:25.920 --> 30:27.930
and tried to ax-murder
his wife and kid

30:27.930 --> 30:29.890
at some fancy ski resort.

30:29.890 --> 30:32.680
And my folks will never
talk to me about it.

30:32.680 --> 30:36.020
So I took his name
just to piss them off.

30:36.020 --> 30:38.520
My real name's Diane.

30:38.520 --> 30:40.310
<i>We have breaking news.</i>

30:40.310 --> 30:42.360
<i>Less than an hour ago,
a firefighting helicopter</i>

30:42.360 --> 30:45.070
<i>exploded near Castle Lake,
killing the pilot</i>

30:45.070 --> 30:47.030
<i>and two firefighters on board.</i>

30:47.030 --> 30:48.950
<i>- They were attempting...
- This fucking lighter.</i>

30:48.950 --> 30:50.320
<i>That originated on Black Mountain</i>

30:50.320 --> 30:52.030
<i>with flame retardant
when the pilot</i>

30:52.030 --> 30:53.580
<i>apparently lost control
of the aircraft.</i>

30:55.370 --> 30:57.660
<i>This tragedy means
five people have now died</i>

30:57.660 --> 30:59.710
<i>as a result
of these powerful fires.</i>

30:59.710 --> 31:01.790
<i>Multiple others
are at County Hospital</i>

31:01.790 --> 31:03.800
<i>being treated for burns,
many of whom</i>

31:03.800 --> 31:05.170
<i>are in critical condition.</i>

31:17.600 --> 31:21.400
It was all they had left
in the machine.

31:27.940 --> 31:30.320
She's usually OK
in the mornings.

31:37.500 --> 31:41.790
I bought her a ring in '91.

31:41.790 --> 31:46.170
She said it'd be confusing
to her boy.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.470
And she didn't deserve it.

31:50.470 --> 31:52.180
Happiness.

31:54.850 --> 31:58.060
Eventually I quit asking
and moved south.

31:58.060 --> 32:00.230
Live free or die.

32:03.020 --> 32:07.190
By the time I moved back,
I figured we'd missed our shot.

32:07.190 --> 32:10.280
I was an old fuck anyway.

32:12.030 --> 32:15.030
Then I get a phone call.

32:15.030 --> 32:18.910
Somebody heard gunfire up
at your mom's place.

32:18.910 --> 32:22.330
I wasn't sheriff, but folks
still rang me up time to time.

32:22.330 --> 32:23.500
Gunfire?

32:25.330 --> 32:26.420
What happened?

32:26.420 --> 32:28.380
Your mother came to the door

32:28.380 --> 32:31.170
looking like she'd been
to hell and back,

32:31.170 --> 32:32.970
threw her arms around me,

32:32.970 --> 32:35.090
begged me, "Don't leave."

32:44.020 --> 32:46.060
I thought I could keep her safe.

32:51.490 --> 32:52.650
She's awake.

33:04.790 --> 33:06.380
Oh.

33:07.630 --> 33:09.340
You gotta get back to them.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.170
The naming.

33:13.170 --> 33:14.840
I ruined the party.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.510
No, you didn't.

33:16.510 --> 33:19.100
You didn't ruin anything.

33:33.150 --> 33:35.660
It was the damn dog.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.700
Nothing stays dead in this town.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.080
It's like I opened the book
and all the pictures...

33:51.420 --> 33:53.260
someone tore them out.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.630
Rearranged them.

34:15.780 --> 34:18.030
You know how it feels,
don't you?

34:19.570 --> 34:20.949
To forget your own story.

34:40.590 --> 34:41.929
I don't know what happened.

34:41.929 --> 34:43.350
We were just shooting the shit.

34:43.350 --> 34:44.219
Where is he?

35:13.500 --> 35:15.420
<i>We're both
getting out...</i>

35:15.420 --> 35:18.090
<i>Make a fist
and bump it against mine.</i>

35:23.050 --> 35:24.470
I didn't know
where you went.

35:24.470 --> 35:27.100
I was... I was worried about you.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.900
I shouldn't be here.

35:37.110 --> 35:38.820
I should still be in the hole.

35:40.070 --> 35:43.700
No, listen to me.

35:43.700 --> 35:47.040
Warden Lacy was just
a sick old man.

35:47.040 --> 35:50.160
Whatever he said to you,

35:50.160 --> 35:51.790
it wasn't true.

35:58.050 --> 35:59.470
<i>The stain.</i>

35:59.470 --> 36:02.090
You're just a kid.

36:12.350 --> 36:14.730
<i>- You okay?</i>
- HENRY Yeah. Just...

36:14.730 --> 36:17.480
I want Wendell to be able
to remember her when she's gone,

36:17.480 --> 36:19.400
and I don't know how much longer

36:19.400 --> 36:21.820
she'll be able to recognize him.

36:21.820 --> 36:23.780
<i>I guess he could
take a bus up there.</i>

36:23.780 --> 36:26.240
I really appreciate it, Maret.

36:35.330 --> 36:38.210
<i>Front door open.</i>

36:50.520 --> 36:52.310
Henry.

36:57.770 --> 36:59.230
Molly.

37:02.780 --> 37:04.280
I tried calling you.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.740
I'm sorry, my phone is...

37:06.740 --> 37:08.910
It's a long story.

37:10.490 --> 37:12.910
How did you get in?

37:12.910 --> 37:15.290
There's a key under the frog.

37:18.340 --> 37:23.170
So I found him on top
of the old shirt factory...

37:23.170 --> 37:25.680
on, you know, I thought
he was gonna jump.

37:25.680 --> 37:29.100
- Whew.
- Had to give him an Oxy

37:29.100 --> 37:30.770
just to get him in the car.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.640
He's still in there.
He's sleeping it off.

37:38.190 --> 37:39.690
He feels wrong.

37:41.650 --> 37:44.820
Well, thank you
for getting him settled down.

37:44.820 --> 37:46.910
I think maybe we just need
to get some rest, and...

37:46.910 --> 37:50.080
OK. Um, so I'm not
explaining it right. Um...

38:00.380 --> 38:05.170
Everyone broadcasts
at their own frequency.

38:05.170 --> 38:09.350
Sometimes it's deafening,
you know, like with you.

38:09.350 --> 38:13.350
Sometimes it's so faint
I can barely hear it.

38:13.350 --> 38:16.940
But after years of this,
I've heard it all.

38:19.310 --> 38:22.440
With him, it's just...

38:22.440 --> 38:25.240
It's like I was listening
to the pain of everyone

38:25.240 --> 38:26.700
in this town all at once.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.620
OK.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.790
Oh, you don't believe me.

38:39.790 --> 38:41.340
No, no, no, I do. I do.

38:41.340 --> 38:43.170
I just...

38:44.800 --> 38:47.130
Look, I don't know
what to say to that.

38:51.430 --> 38:54.100
Your right ear is ringing.

38:54.100 --> 38:58.020
So loud you can barely
hear yourself think.

38:58.020 --> 39:01.310
You feel guilty about
the clients you couldn't save,

39:01.310 --> 39:03.360
about those dead prison guards,

39:03.360 --> 39:06.070
about your mom, and your father,

39:06.070 --> 39:08.240
and <i>your</i> son,
who barely has a father.

39:10.070 --> 39:12.490
And you haven't eaten yet today.

39:18.960 --> 39:21.040
I'm telling you,

39:21.040 --> 39:24.090
there is something wrong
with that kid.

39:24.090 --> 39:26.340
<i>Front door open.</i>

39:38.770 --> 39:41.190
Maybe you should
stay here tonight.

39:41.190 --> 39:43.110
Hmm?

39:43.110 --> 39:44.570
Come on.

40:38.540 --> 40:41.000
My dad spent
a lot of time out here.

40:42.750 --> 40:45.920
It's not the Ritz,
but it has a pull-out.

40:55.010 --> 40:56.600
At least it used to.

41:30.250 --> 41:32.050
Make yourself at home.

41:41.470 --> 41:43.180
Now...

41:45.390 --> 41:47.400
you need anything...

41:49.400 --> 41:51.230
you just cross the yard.

42:33.650 --> 42:34.900
You play piano.

42:39.110 --> 42:42.240
Huh. That's somethin'.

42:42.240 --> 42:44.580
I remember.

42:48.790 --> 42:51.090
It'll all come back to you
before you know it.

43:13.320 --> 43:15.440
A fuckin' bridge.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.960
<i>Well, I may be half
bombed, but I coulda sworn...</i>

43:33.960 --> 43:36.840
<i>You're still
the smartest person I know.</i>

44:23.640 --> 44:25.390
Hey, asshole.

44:38.860 --> 44:41.280
Do you know who I am?

44:45.620 --> 44:48.830
Don't look at me like that,
fucker. You know me.

44:50.200 --> 44:52.410
You remember.

44:56.130 --> 45:00.670
<i>That's right. Lacy.</i>

45:00.670 --> 45:05.050
<i>I pulled him over
in the middle of the night.</i>

45:07.140 --> 45:11.480
<i>Wear a badge long enough
in this fuckin' county,</i>

45:11.480 --> 45:13.600
<i>guy with the Devil
in his Lincoln</i>

45:13.600 --> 45:16.310
<i>doesn't sound half
bug-shit crazy.</i>

45:16.310 --> 45:18.730
He asked me to trust him.

45:20.360 --> 45:22.690
God help me, I did.

45:24.280 --> 45:26.490
I used to dream about you.

45:26.490 --> 45:30.580
I can't remember
my own dead wife's face,

45:30.580 --> 45:32.750
but I <i>never</i> forgot yours.

45:32.750 --> 45:36.580
Not for 27 fucking years.

45:42.840 --> 45:45.260
Don't think I didn't wonder.

45:45.260 --> 45:50.220
<i>Should I let a monster drive
off with a boy in his trunk?</i>

45:58.060 --> 46:01.570
Now I'm an old man,

46:01.570 --> 46:05.110
and you haven't aged
one goddamn day.

46:09.990 --> 46:12.160
Are you the Devil?

46:16.040 --> 46:17.370
No.

46:17.370 --> 46:20.090
Then what the fuck are you?!

46:21.250 --> 46:23.050
<i>I tried my best.</i>

46:24.720 --> 46:27.720
<i>I tried to keep
the people of this town safe.</i>

46:29.220 --> 46:31.600
<i>Where's it land you?</i>

46:31.600 --> 46:36.270
You wait 30 years
for the woman you love

46:36.270 --> 46:38.850
and finally you get her,

46:38.850 --> 46:41.520
and she slips through
your fingers.

46:44.480 --> 46:47.990
And here you are,
fuckin' Rip Van Winkle.

46:47.990 --> 46:52.330
Where's the justice in that?

46:55.500 --> 46:57.710
I asked you

46:57.710 --> 46:59.670
a fuckin' question.

47:04.630 --> 47:06.920
I can help her.

47:14.970 --> 47:18.020
You have no idea
what's happening here, do you?
