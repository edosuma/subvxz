00:45.000 --> 00:48.500
i wasn't going for a laugh.

00:50.930 --> 00:54.160
come on, luther.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.890

00:57.900 --> 01:00.920

01:00.930 --> 01:05.060
i'm so backed up  i'm literally cockeyed.

01:13.330 --> 01:17.030
hot girl at 12:00

01:18.530 --> 01:23.660
-where? -over there.

01:24.530 --> 01:27.490
that would be 9:00.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.150
no, it's 12:00.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.820
actually, 12:05.

01:30.830 --> 01:33.920
12-ish.

01:33.930 --> 01:35.490
you want to straighten him out,or should i?

01:35.500 --> 01:37.050
go ahead, take a swing.

01:37.060 --> 01:38.120
okay.

01:38.130 --> 01:39.820
The reason guys say hot girl

01:39.830 --> 01:41.550
at like 12:00 or 3:00

01:41.560 --> 01:45.420
is to specify a location using the clock face as kind of a map.

01:45.430 --> 01:47.320
what if you have a digital watch?

01:47.330 --> 01:49.550
first of all,

01:49.560 --> 01:52.050
you're not gonna meet any women if you wear a digital watch.

01:52.060 --> 01:53.490
and second of all,it doesn't matter.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.290
the clock face is imaginly.

01:55.300 --> 01:59.000
then how do you know what time you saw the girl?

02:00.060 --> 02:02.050
you know what, i'm wrong.

02:02.060 --> 02:06.160
-there's a hot girl,and it's 12:06 -check

02:07.900 --> 02:10.229
hey, he likes girls and he can tell time.

02:10.229 --> 02:13.660
i'm a happy dad.

02:16.860 --> 02:18.550
hello, your honor. what's up?

02:18.560 --> 02:19.750

02:25.060 --> 02:27.290

02:27.300 --> 02:28.720
no, a real judge.

02:28.730 --> 02:32.900
american idol judges are real, dad.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.990

02:35.000 --> 02:37.590

03:19.600 --> 03:21.320

03:21.330 --> 03:23.420
i got a postcard from her the other day.

03:23.430 --> 03:25.020

03:30.100 --> 03:31.950
ha-ha.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.690

let's see, what else...oh, yeah.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.050

well, there you go.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.350
she's in england.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.690
i guess.

03:45.700 --> 03:48.990
so why do i keep thinking i see her?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.630
-maybe u miss her -i don't think so..

03:50.630 --> 03:52.690
i mean, i was a little down when she left,

03:52.700 --> 03:54.120
which is to be expected,

03:54.130 --> 03:55.850
but i've got linda now and i've moved on

03:55.860 --> 03:58.520
and why the hell am i talking to you about my personal life?

03:58.530 --> 04:01.460
because i'm a good listener?

04:01.700 --> 04:05.330
because you have no other friends?

04:06.700 --> 04:08.700
after this we're dropping him off

a few months ago.

05:23.960 --> 05:27.050
i notice you didn't toss it out.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.890
what's that supposed to mean?

05:28.900 --> 05:30.950
charlie, of all the broads

05:30.960 --> 05:34.290
who stagged bare-ass through the hell of holes

05:34.300 --> 05:36.050
she's the one who really got to you.

05:36.060 --> 05:38.390
yeah, she got to me.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.460
she put a sleeping pill in my scotch

05:40.460 --> 05:42.790
and superglued my testles to my leg

05:42.800 --> 05:45.150
you just can't get past that,can you?

05:45.160 --> 05:47.490
well, it doesn't matter.

05:47.500 --> 05:50.350
i'm a real relationship now with an incredible woman--

05:50.360 --> 05:52.050
a judge,a constitutional scholar,

05:52.060 --> 05:54.690
a woman who may one day may be a state senator.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.220
but does she care although to line her mittens

05:57.230 --> 05:59.920
with hair she collects from your shower drain?

05:59.930 --> 06:02.320
i don't know yet.we're going slow.

06:02.330 --> 06:03.790
really?

06:03.800 --> 06:06.490
yes.we're getting to know each other as people

06:06.500 --> 06:08.820
before we jump into bed and get to know each other

06:08.830 --> 06:10.820
as, you know, animals.

06:10.830 --> 06:13.590
justo me a favor and make the first time at her place,

06:13.600 --> 06:17.360

11:56.630 --> 11:59.500
thank you.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.690
i finally got to step up to the plate,

12:06.700 --> 12:10.530
and i was swinging a garden hose.

12:13.060 --> 12:16.960
-you happy? -i'm not sad.

12:20.030 --> 12:23.630
what do you think the problem was?

12:24.700 --> 12:27.150
-i saw her again -saw who?

12:27.160 --> 12:30.390
rose. she brought champagne to our hotel room,

12:30.400 --> 12:34.030
expect, this time, she was hispanic

12:35.160 --> 12:36.820
what was she last time?

12:36.830 --> 12:38.550
last time, she was a blonde with coffee,

12:38.560 --> 12:40.990
and the time before that, she was a redhead with a dog.

12:41.000 --> 12:41.990
what kind of dog?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.650
what difference does it make?

12:43.660 --> 12:47.650
i like dogs.

12:47.660 --> 12:49.090
go on.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.630
if i didn't know any better,

12:50.630 --> 12:52.150
i'd say she was stalking me again.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.350
from england?

12:53.360 --> 12:55.190
we don't know she's in england!

12:55.200 --> 12:56.620
she sends letters and postcards.

12:56.630 --> 12:58.220
jake gets them all the time.

12:58.230 --> 13:00.520
oh, come on! like she couldn't leave a stack of them

13:00.530 --> 13:02.220
with some friend to mail every few days?

13:02.230 --> 13:04.220
wow.are you listening to yourself?

13:04.230 --> 13:06.220
even rose isn't that crazy.

13:06.230 --> 13:09.190
oh, and she's going to fly back and forth with a dog?

13:09.200 --> 13:13.660
she could hire a local dog.

13:14.030 --> 13:16.200
charlie, rose is in england. she's not stalking you.

13:16.200 --> 13:20.160
and whatever you think you're seeing is in your head.

13:21.200 --> 13:28.790
yes, you probably right. regardless last night was less than a triumph.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.290
why didn't you just take one of your pills?

13:31.300 --> 13:36.390
because somebody else took my last three.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.820
oh, yeah.

13:38.830 --> 13:42.620
thank you.

13:42.630 --> 13:45.550
thank you thank you, thank you.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.420
that's four.

13:47.430 --> 13:51.560
first one was two-fer.

13:53.230 --> 13:54.550
what kind of dog?

13:54.560 --> 13:56.050
i don't know. it was a dog!

13:56.060 --> 13:59.190
four legs and a tail.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.150
can we please get back to my problem?

14:01.160 --> 14:04.690
not a dog person.

14:04.700 --> 14:07.420
so, you believe you're seeing people who aren't there.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.090
no, no, no, no, no.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.190
they're there, but they're not who they are

14:11.200 --> 14:12.790
well, then who are they?

14:12.800 --> 14:16.420
i don't know who they are, but they all look like rose.

14:16.430 --> 14:17.850
your stalker.

14:17.860 --> 14:20.420
well, that's kind of harsh.

14:20.430 --> 14:22.820
you told me she broke into your home, disrobed,

14:22.830 --> 14:24.920
and handcuffed herself to your refrigerator.

14:24.930 --> 14:29.900
well, just the one time.

14:30.300 --> 14:33.220
so why do i keep seeing her everywhere i go?

14:33.230 --> 14:34.920
well, gee, charlie if i tell you that now,

14:34.930 --> 14:37.930
what'll we do for the rest of the hour?

14:37.960 --> 14:41.300
i'm joshing.

14:41.530 --> 14:44.950
why don't we talk about your current relationship?

14:44.960 --> 14:48.820
linda? well, let's see.she's a municipal court

14:48.830 --> 14:50.790
-very impressive -thank you

14:50.800 --> 14:53.620
i meant for her, charlie.

14:53.630 --> 14:55.650
it's hardly your accomplishment, now, is it?

14:55.660 --> 14:57.620
well, yeah in a way.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.350
i've never done a judge before.

14:59.360 --> 15:03.860
well from what you told me, you still haven't.

15:05.830 --> 15:08.750
pays to listen.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.320
so how old is linda?

15:10.330 --> 15:11.500
she's about my age.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.750
wow. this the first time you've

15:12.760 --> 15:14.020
been with women that old?

15:14.030 --> 15:15.850
oh, no. not at all.

15:15.860 --> 15:21.520
-so you've had age-appropriate relationship before? -relationships? no no are you crazy

15:21.530 --> 15:24.590
am i crazy? npot-kettle, charlie?

15:24.600 --> 15:30.090
okay, look, i didn't come to therapy to talk this death.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.290
i've seen rose three times,

15:32.300 --> 15:34.450
and it's ruining my sex life with linda.

15:34.460 --> 15:35.890
can you help me,

15:35.900 --> 15:38.420
or do i have to learn to shoot pool with a rope?

15:38.430 --> 15:42.430
well, thank you for that disturbing image.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.790
best i can tell, charlie, for the first time in your life,

15:45.800 --> 15:48.550
you are involved in an adult relationship.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.350
it's challenging. maybe even a little intimidating.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.050
and the fact that you're fantasizing

15:53.060 --> 15:54.590
about a woman in england

15:54.600 --> 15:57.720
who idolized you beyond all rational measure?

15:57.730 --> 16:00.920
well, that tells me that you're afraid to grow up.

16:00.930 --> 16:02.850
we call that the peter pan syndrome.

16:02.860 --> 16:07.120
that's pretty good.

16:07.130 --> 16:08.550
so what can we do?

16:08.560 --> 16:11.120
you know, peter-wise?

16:11.130 --> 16:13.390
if you're committed to personal growth,

16:13.400 --> 16:16.220
you'll walk through your fear and embrace the challenges

16:16.230 --> 16:18.120
of a really meaningful relationship

16:18.130 --> 16:20.520
with an adult woman.

16:20.530 --> 16:21.890
and you only other choice

16:21.900 --> 16:23.590
is to live the emotionallynly stunted lifer choice

16:23.600 --> 16:26.220
you've been living over and over,

16:26.230 --> 16:30.800
never growing and never changing.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.560
good afternoon and welcome to aboard British Airways

16:34.570 --> 16:36.190
flight 471

16:36.200 --> 16:40.800

16:58.000 --> 17:00.150

17:00.160 --> 17:02.590

17:02.600 --> 17:05.890
what are you doing here?

17:05.900 --> 17:07.890
i'm not sure.i just needed to see you.

17:07.900 --> 17:09.300
i needed to talk to you.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.589
and i can come back if now is not a good time.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.490
no, no. it's okay.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.119
i know you've probably moved on.

17:16.130 --> 17:17.819
i thought i had, too.

17:17.829 --> 17:21.619
but, everywhere i look,i keep seeing your face,

17:21.630 --> 17:24.619
so i start thinking maybe...

17:24.630 --> 17:27.619
i don't know what i'm thinking.

17:27.630 --> 17:28.950
are you... are you busy?

17:28.960 --> 17:31.350

17:31.360 --> 17:33.350

17:33.360 --> 17:35.420

17:35.430 --> 17:37.920

17:37.930 --> 17:39.790

17:58.830 --> 18:03.900
no. this fits perfectly into my plans.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.590

18:07.600 --> 18:10.320

charlie,i miss you, too.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.550

19:59.560 --> 20:01.820
actually i am seeing someone,

20:01.830 --> 20:04.850
but i'm not really sure where it's going yet.

20:04.860 --> 20:06.790
you?

20:06.800 --> 20:10.120
to be honest, there is one lady i've been dating.

20:10.130 --> 20:12.520
she's actually my own age.

20:12.530 --> 20:13.790
no.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.650
yeah.

20:15.660 --> 20:19.150
but my therapist says she's not good for me.

20:19.160 --> 20:22.420
and you think i am?

20:22.430 --> 20:25.690
well, you've always loved me for who i am

20:25.700 --> 20:27.460
instead of who i could be,

20:27.460 --> 20:29.020
which is really wonderful because

20:29.030 --> 20:33.800
let's face it,we both love who i am.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.650

you can't expect me to go back

20:51.730 --> 20:53.420
to what i had  without a commitment.

20:53.430 --> 20:56.750
a commitment?
