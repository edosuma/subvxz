CHRISTMAS EVE
SOMEWHERE IN MARYLAND

00:10.000 --> 00:16.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:29.300 --> 00:35.200
- I almost gave up on you.
- Sorry. Checkout lines were worse than rush hour on the 95.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.900
If I heard "Silent Night" one more time
I was going to start taking hostages.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.900
- What are we doing here?
- Stakeout.

00:42.900 --> 00:45.400
- On Christmas Eve?
- It's an important date.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.600
- No kidding.
- Important to why we're here.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.500
Why don't you turn off your
car and I'll fill you in on the details.

00:50.500 --> 00:55.500
Mulder, I've got wrapping to do.
It's the night before Christmas.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.100
Let's hear it.
Give me the details.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.300
Look, if you've got Christmas stuff
to do I don't want to... you know...

01:15.300 --> 01:18.900
Mulder, I drove all the way out here.
I might as well know why. Right?

01:18.900 --> 01:22.500
I just thought you'd be more... curious.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.100
- Who lives in the house?
- No one.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.400
- Then who are we staking out?
- The former occupants.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.800
- They've come back?
- That's the story.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.100
I see.

01:34.900 --> 01:42.200
The dark, gothic manor the, uh, omnipresent
low fog hugging the thicket of overgrowth.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.900
Wait-- is that a hound I hear
baying out on the moors?

01:46.900 --> 01:49.600
No. Actually that was a left cheek sneak.

01:49.600 --> 01:54.000
Mulder, tell me you didn't call me out here
on Christmas Eve to go ghost busting with you.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.200
- Technically speaking they're called apparitions.
- Mulder, call it what you want.

01:57.200 --> 02:03.600
I've got holiday cheer to spread.
I've got a family roll call under the tree at 6:00 a.m.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.900
I'll make it fast.
I'll just give you the details.

02:07.300 --> 02:12.200
- Okay.
- Christmas, 1917. It was a time of dark, dark despair.

02:12.200 --> 02:17.100
American soldiers were dying at an ungodly rate
in a war-torn Europe while at home, a deadly strain...

02:17.100 --> 02:22.200
...of the flu virus attacked young and old alike.
Tragedy was a visitor on every doorstep while a...

02:22.200 --> 02:27.800
...creeping hopelessness set in with every man,
woman and child. It was a time of dark, dark despair.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.900
You said that.

02:29.900 --> 02:34.800
But here at 1501 Larkspur Lane for a pair of
star-crossed lovers tragedy came not...

02:34.800 --> 02:42.100
...from war or pestilence, not by the boot heel
or the bombardier, but by their own innocent hand.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.200
- Go on.
- His name was Maurice. He was a...

02:46.200 --> 02:50.600
...a brooding but heroic young man beloved
of Lyda, a sublime beauty with a light...

02:50.600 --> 02:53.300
...that seemed to follow her wherever she went.

02:53.300 --> 02:57.400
They were likened to two angels descended from
heaven whom the gods could not protect from the...

02:57.400 --> 03:01.700
...horrors being visited upon this cold, grey earth.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.500
And what happened to them?

03:03.500 --> 03:10.900
Driven by a tragic fear of separation they forged a
lovers' pact so that they might spend eternity together...

03:10.900 --> 03:16.000
- ...and not spend one precious Christmas apart.
- They killed themselves?

03:16.000 --> 03:20.700
And their ghosts haunt
this house every Christmas Eve.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.100
I just gave myself chills.

03:24.100 --> 03:28.500
It's a good story, Mulder... And very
well told but I don't believe it.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.400
You don't believe in ghosts?

03:30.400 --> 03:35.600
- That surprises you?
- Well... Yeah. I thought everybody believed in ghosts.

03:35.600 --> 03:42.300
Mulder, if it were any other night I might let you
talk me into it but the halls are decked and I got to go.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.100
- My best to the family.
- What are you doing?

03:51.500 --> 03:55.000
- Mulder, don't you have somewhere to be?
- I'm just going to take a look.

04:02.100 --> 04:06.000
I'm not going to do it.
My New Year's resolution.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.900
Mulder!

04:41.100 --> 04:44.300
- Change your mind?
- Did you take my car keys?

04:44.300 --> 04:45.400
No.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.400
- Come on, Mulder. Don't kid around.
- Why would I take your car keys?

04:48.400 --> 04:50.800
Maybe you, uh...

04:51.900 --> 04:56.000
- Maybe you grabbed them by mistake.
- Maybe it was a ghost.

05:10.700 --> 05:15.300
- Cold wind.
- There must be a window open upstairs.

05:15.700 --> 05:20.100
You know, the weather report said that there
was an 80 percent chance of rain maybe even a...

05:20.100 --> 05:23.000
...maybe even a white Christmas.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.000
I think the spirits are among us.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.600
Mulder, will you quit trying to scare
me and help me get these doors open.

06:36.600 --> 06:40.100
Sounds like there's somebody
walking around upstairs.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.300
There. You hear that?

06:42.300 --> 06:45.800
- Mulder, I really have to go.
- There's nothing to be afraid of.

06:45.800 --> 06:50.800
- I'm not afraid, okay?
- Ghosts are benevolent entities.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.800
Mostly.

06:55.600 --> 06:59.200
You are not scaring me, Mulder.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.700
Look, I really have to get home.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.100
Mulder...

07:22.200 --> 07:24.400
What was that?

07:24.500 --> 07:30.500
These are tricks that the mind plays. They are ingrained
cliches from a thousand different horror films.

07:30.500 --> 07:34.900
When we hear a sound, we get a chill. We-we
see a shadow and we allow ourselves to imagine...

07:34.900 --> 07:39.300
...something that an otherwise rational
person would discount out of hand.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.700
The whole... Mulder...?

07:43.700 --> 07:47.500
The whole idea of a benevolent entity
fits perfectly with what I'm saying.

07:47.500 --> 07:54.100
That a spirit would materialize or return for no other
purpose than to show itself is silly and ridiculous.

07:54.100 --> 07:59.900
I mean, what it really shows is how silly and
ridiculous we have become in believing such things.

07:59.900 --> 08:05.200
I mean, that we can ignore all natural laws
about the corporeal body that-that we...

08:05.200 --> 08:12.100
...witness these spirits clad in-in their own shabby
outfits with the same old haircuts and hairstyles...

08:12.100 --> 08:16.700
...never aging, never... never in search of more
comfortable surroundings, it actually ends up...

08:16.700 --> 08:20.200
...saying more about the living
than it does about the dead.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.600
I mean, Mulder, it doesn't take an advanced
degree in psychology to understand the...

08:23.600 --> 08:28.300
...the unconscious yearnings
that these imaginings satisfy.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.500
You know, the-the longing for immortality...

08:31.500 --> 08:36.799
...the hope that there is something beyond this mortal coil,
that-that we might never be long without our loved ones.

08:36.799 --> 08:40.400
I mean, these are powerful, powerful desires.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.200
I mean, they're the very
essence of what make us human.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.700
The very essence of Christmas, actually.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.200
Tell me you're not afraid.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.600
All right. I'm afraid...

08:57.100 --> 08:59.600
...but it's an irrational fear.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.300
- I got your back.
- Thank you.

09:27.700 --> 09:32.900
Mulder, did it occur to you that there aren't ghosts here
but that somebody actually might be living in this house?

09:32.900 --> 09:34.500
No one lives here.

09:34.500 --> 09:39.500
But when you and I were sitting out
in the car there was not a light on.

09:39.900 --> 09:42.400
And look at this.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.800
Must have been some kind of electrical surge.

10:12.800 --> 10:17.400
Mulder, did you happen to notice the
clock downstairs is keeping perfect time?

10:17.400 --> 10:18.800
Is it?

10:19.600 --> 10:23.000
And how do you explain that?

10:35.900 --> 10:37.900
This fire has just gone out.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.300
Yeah.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.800
Don't look so disappointed.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.300
Why would anyone want
to live in a cursed house?

10:45.300 --> 10:48.200
Mulder, it's not enough that
it's haunted? It has to be cursed?

10:48.200 --> 10:51.300
Every couple that's ever
lived here has met a tragic end.

10:51.300 --> 10:55.700
Three double murders in the last
80 years. All on Christmas Eve.

11:02.100 --> 11:07.000
Whoa... There's that sound again.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.700
Mulder?

11:53.600 --> 11:57.600
- That's not funny!
- I think there's a hiding space under the floorboards.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.900
What are you going to do?

12:00.100 --> 12:02.500
There may be somebody trapped under there.
I got to get them out.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.000
- Mulder, don't. Not now.
- Hey, you have a gun, right?

12:05.000 --> 12:08.300
Rationally, you've been in much
more dangerous situations.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.200
I was half right.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.900
Oh, my God.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.400
Hey, Scully...

12:44.000 --> 12:45.500
Look at this.

12:50.700 --> 12:53.400
It's a woman.

12:54.500 --> 12:58.000
- Mulder, it looks like they were shot to death.
- Yeah.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.800
You know what's weird?

13:02.800 --> 13:03.700
What?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.400
Mulder, she's wearing my outfit.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.000
How embarrassing.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.700
Yeah, well, you know what?
He's wearing yours.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.200
Oh... Scully...

13:26.200 --> 13:28.100
That's us.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.500
Hey, Scully...

13:40.300 --> 13:42.600
This is the same room.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.300
All right.

14:14.300 --> 14:17.800
I'm beginning to... Get this.

14:17.800 --> 14:21.600
You go through that door and I...

14:21.600 --> 14:25.000
- I should come out... This door.
- Right.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.000
- Mulder!
- Scully!

15:12.600 --> 15:14.800
Scully!

15:24.800 --> 15:26.700
Hey, Scully.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.500
Scully, can you hear me?

15:49.700 --> 15:51.200
Hey!

15:56.300 --> 15:57.400
Who are you?

15:57.400 --> 16:02.700
That's a question I should be asking
being this is my house you're standing in.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.900
This isn't one of those home invasions, is it?

16:07.900 --> 16:12.200
- No.
- Good. Would you like me to show you the door?

16:12.200 --> 16:14.000
That's very funny.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.700
- I wasn't making a joke.
- Have you looked at the door?

16:17.700 --> 16:21.300
- Uh-huh, I'm looking at it now.
- Tell me what you see.

16:21.300 --> 16:27.000
I see a door with the lock shot off it.
You going to pay for that?

16:28.100 --> 16:31.600
That's a door with a brick wall behind it.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.300
Okay, sure.

16:34.900 --> 16:37.000
You're playing tricks on me.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.400
If I am, I'm sorry but I don't know any tricks.

16:40.400 --> 16:45.900
Yeah? That's a trick in itself, isn't it?
You've been playing tricks on us since we got here.

16:45.900 --> 16:49.000
Am I to take it we're not alone?

16:49.900 --> 16:53.300
Ah, that's very funny coming from a ghost.

16:57.100 --> 17:04.800
Yeah, oh... the gun fooled me a little at first.
You're a ghost hunter, huh?

17:04.800 --> 17:07.900
And you think I'm a ghost, huh?

17:09.599 --> 17:14.000
I've seen a lot of strange folks coming
around here with a lot of strange equipment...

17:14.000 --> 17:18.200
...but I think you must be
the first I've seen come armed.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.000
Strange folks?

17:20.200 --> 17:22.900
Like those folks under the floorboard.

17:28.800 --> 17:32.000
- How did you do that?
- I didn't do anything.

17:32.400 --> 17:37.600
There were corpses here, bodies
buried under the floorboards.

17:39.300 --> 17:42.500
Why don't you have a seat, son.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.100
- You drink? Take drugs?
- No.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.300
- Get high?
- No.

17:56.300 --> 18:02.000
Are you overcome by the impulse
to make everyone believe you?

18:05.300 --> 18:10.800
I'm in the field of mental health.
I specialize in disorders and manias...

18:10.800 --> 18:17.100
...related to pathological behavior
as it pertains to the paranormal.

18:17.100 --> 18:21.400
Wow. I didn't know such a thing existed.

18:21.400 --> 18:25.500
My specialty is in what I call soul prospectors.

18:25.500 --> 18:33.800
A crossaxial classification I've codified by
extensive interaction with visitors like yourself.

18:33.800 --> 18:39.800
I've found you all tend to fall
into pretty much the same category.

18:39.800 --> 18:46.900
- And what category is that?
- Narcissistic, overzealous, self-righteous egomaniac.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
- That's a category?
- You kindly think of yourself as single-minded...

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
...but you're prone to obsessive
compulsiveness workaholism, antisocialism...

18:59.000 --> 19:05.200
Fertile fields for the descent
into total wacko breakdown.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.000
I don't think that pegs me exactly.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.500
Oh, really? Waving a gun
around my house? Huh?

19:13.500 --> 19:18.200
Raving like a lunatic about
some imaginary brick wall?

19:21.300 --> 19:26.900
You've probably convinced
yourself you've seen aliens.

19:26.900 --> 19:32.300
You know why you think
you see the things you do?

19:32.600 --> 19:36.000
Because I have seen them?

19:36.000 --> 19:44.800
'Cause you're a lonely man. A lonely
man chasing paramasturbatory illusions...

19:44.800 --> 19:49.400
...that you believe will give your life meaning
and significance and which your pathetic...

19:49.400 --> 19:55.900
...social maladjustment makes
impossible for you to find elsewhere.

19:55.900 --> 20:04.500
You probably consider yourself passionate,
serious, misunderstood. Am I right?

20:04.700 --> 20:07.000
"Paramasturbatory"?

20:07.000 --> 20:11.400
Most people would rather stick their fingers
in a wall socket than spend a minute with you.

20:11.400 --> 20:16.800
- All right, now just, uh... Just back off for a second.
- Spend every Christmas this way... Alone?

20:16.800 --> 20:18.900
I'm not alone.

20:18.900 --> 20:22.100
- More self-delusion.
- No, I came here with my partner.

20:22.100 --> 20:26.300
- She's somewhere in the house.
- Behind a brick wall?

20:26.300 --> 20:30.100
How'd you get her to come with you?
Steal her car keys?

20:31.800 --> 20:34.100
You know why you do it.

20:34.100 --> 20:42.900
Listen endlessly to her droning rationalizations.
'Cause you're afraid. Afraid of the loneliness.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.900
Am I right?

20:51.600 --> 20:55.000
I'd just like to find my partner.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.600
Good... Easy.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.700
Piece of cake.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.600
Brick wall...

21:12.900 --> 21:19.600
Or brick wall?
Go ahead, change your life.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.300
Mulder?

21:49.400 --> 21:52.700
- No, no, please, I won't hurt you.
- I'm a federal agent! I'm armed.

21:52.700 --> 21:54.600
- You're what?
- I'm armed.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.300
- You said...
- I'm armed.

21:56.300 --> 22:01.100
- You're a federal agent?
- Please, I'm a little on edge. Don't come any closer.

22:01.100 --> 22:06.000
My name is Special Agent Dana Scully.
And, uh, I can...

22:07.200 --> 22:09.300
I can show you my I.D.

22:09.300 --> 22:12.500
My goodness, I... I thought you were a ghost.

22:12.500 --> 22:16.800
I can assure you that I'm not. I, uh,
I got stuck in this room looking for my partner.

22:16.800 --> 22:20.400
Oh, the gangly fellow with
the distinguished profile.

22:20.400 --> 22:25.500
- You've seen him?
- With you in the foyer. I thought he was a ghost, too.

22:27.600 --> 22:31.800
- That was you.
- I sleepwalk sometimes. I thought maybe I'd dreamed it.

22:31.800 --> 22:36.600
- But then here you were again.
- I am sorry... I'm sorry.

22:36.600 --> 22:42.100
I didn't mean to scare you.
I, uh...  It's just that we found bodies.

22:42.100 --> 22:45.500
- Bodies... Where?
- Right...

22:52.700 --> 22:55.700
You look like you saw a ghost.

22:55.700 --> 22:59.000
There are ghosts in this house, you know.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.100
Who are you?

23:06.600 --> 23:09.600
I live here, thank you very much.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.300
Where's my partner?

23:11.300 --> 23:17.100
- Why are you pointing that gun?
- There were corpses right there underneath the floor!

23:22.000 --> 23:24.800
I think maybe the ghosts
have been playing tricks on you.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.300
I don't believe in ghosts.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.600
Then what are you doing here?

23:34.200 --> 23:36.500
It's my partner.

23:37.300 --> 23:41.600
- He believes in ghosts?
- Yeah.

23:41.600 --> 23:44.200
Oh, you poor child.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.300
You must have an awful small life.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.700
Spending your Christmas Eve with him...

23:49.700 --> 23:52.700
Running around chasing
things you don't even believe in.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.800
Don't come any closer.

23:54.900 --> 23:59.900
I can see it in your face... The fear...
The conflicted yearnings...

23:59.900 --> 24:04.100
A subconscious desire to find
fulfillment through another.

24:04.100 --> 24:08.000
- Intimacy through co-dependency.
- What?

24:08.000 --> 24:13.400
Maybe you repress the truth about why you're really
here pretending it's out of duty or loyalty, ...

24:13.400 --> 24:16.700
...unable to admit your dirty little secret.

24:16.700 --> 24:20.200
Your only joy in life is proving him wrong.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.600
You don't know me.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.500
And you don't live here.

24:24.500 --> 24:28.100
- This isn't your house.
- You wouldn't think so, the way I'm being treated.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.500
- Well, then why is all the furniture covered?
- We're having the house painted.

24:31.500 --> 24:35.300
- Well then where's your Christmas tree?!
- We're Jewish. Boo.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.600
Hold it right there.
Don't make me shoot you.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.800
Stay where you are.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.500
We really attract them, don't we?

24:45.600 --> 24:48.300
- Where's Mulder?
- Mulder? Is that his name?

24:48.300 --> 24:51.000
- Where is he?
- He'll be along.

24:52.900 --> 24:55.900
Move over there.
Both of you, move.

24:55.900 --> 24:57.500
Move over there.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.100
Move over there!

25:00.100 --> 25:05.500
This violates our civil rights.
I have friends at the ACLU.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.400
Put your hands up.

25:43.800 --> 25:48.700
You see what we've resorted to?
Gimmicks and cheap tricks.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.600
We used to be so good at this.

25:50.600 --> 25:55.200
We used to have years to drive
them mad. Now we get one night.

25:55.200 --> 25:59.100
This pop psychology approach is crap.
All it does is annoy them.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.400
When's the last time we
actually haunted anyone?

26:01.400 --> 26:05.600
When was the last time we had a good double
murder? Not since the house was condemned.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.700
This is embarrassing... amateur kid stuff.

26:09.100 --> 26:14.300
Look, if we let our reputations slip they're
going to take us off the tourist literature.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.900
Last year no one even showed up.

26:16.900 --> 26:21.000
Of all days, why did you pick Christmas?
Why not Halloween?

26:21.400 --> 26:25.900
Now, who is filled with hopelessness
and futility on Halloween?

26:26.300 --> 26:29.500
Christmas comes but once a year.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.400
You're right.

26:33.100 --> 26:36.800
These two do seem pretty miserable.

26:36.800 --> 26:42.600
We need to show them just
how lonely Christmas can be.

26:42.600 --> 26:46.100
Now that's the old Yuletide spirit.

27:16.100 --> 27:19.700
- Are you Agent Mulder?
- Who are you, now?

27:20.000 --> 27:24.400
- What are you doing using my chair for a ladder?
- I'm trying to get out of this room.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.000
- Trying to get out?
- Excuse me.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.900
No, no. You can't get out that way.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.500
- Masher.
- Frump.

27:43.800 --> 27:47.600
I don't know who you're calling
a frump but I don't appreciate that.

27:47.600 --> 27:52.300
Being manhandled, or called names.
Certainly not at this hour.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.100
You're a ghost.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.400
Oh, more names!

27:59.200 --> 28:04.400
- What happened to the star-crossed lovers?
- Oh, let me tell you the romance is the first thing to go.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.900
It's you.

28:08.200 --> 28:11.700
You're Lyda, and that was Maurice.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.500
But you've aged.

28:14.500 --> 28:18.800
I hope your partner finds you
a lot more charming than I do.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.400
Let's see where is it.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.500
There it is.

28:42.500 --> 28:46.500
I was young and beautiful once,
just like your partner.

28:54.700 --> 28:58.500
Look at us.
Maurice was so handsome.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.100
He didn't have a gut.

29:08.600 --> 29:12.200
I hope you're not expecting
any great advantages to all this.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.200
To all what?

29:13.200 --> 29:16.200
I'm assuming you came here
with similar misconceptions.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.300
We came here looking for you.

29:18.300 --> 29:23.300
Oh, yeah? You didn't come
here to be together for eternity?

29:23.800 --> 29:24.900
No.

29:24.900 --> 29:29.100
Because you're filled with despair
and woeful Christmas melancholy?

29:29.100 --> 29:30.800
Why?

29:31.900 --> 29:35.600
- Maybe it was your partner then.
- What about her?

29:35.600 --> 29:38.500
- You knew this house was haunted.
- Yeah.

29:38.800 --> 29:43.000
Maybe you two should have discussed your
real feelings before you came out here.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.900
I'm speaking from experience.

29:46.200 --> 29:49.400
- What experience?
- I'm not going to get into semantics.

29:49.400 --> 29:53.800
- A murder-suicide is all about trust.
- I thought you had a lovers' pact.

29:54.600 --> 30:00.000
Poetic illusions aside, the outcome,
Mulder, is pretty much the same.

30:01.900 --> 30:05.500
- I don't show my hole to just anyone.
- Why are you showing it to me?

30:05.500 --> 30:09.600
It isn't like you're going to be
eating any Christmas ham, is it?

30:10.300 --> 30:13.400
Oh, you're trying to tell me
that Scully's going to shoot me.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.900
Scully is not going to shoot me.

30:15.900 --> 30:20.700
Suit yourself, but if you shoot first,
for her, the rest is an act of faith.

30:20.700 --> 30:23.500
- I wouldn't shoot her.
- Maybe she shoots herself.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.200
I wouldn't let her.

30:26.700 --> 30:29.600
The bodies under the floor...

30:29.600 --> 30:33.400
Maybe that was just some
kind of Jungian symbolism.

30:33.400 --> 30:37.800
Or maybe... there's a secret lovers' pact.

30:38.100 --> 30:40.200
We're not lovers.

30:40.200 --> 30:43.000
And this isn't a pure science.

30:43.000 --> 30:50.100
But you're both so attractive and
there'll be a lot of time to work that out.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.100
Go ahead, take it.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.800
Take it.

30:55.300 --> 30:59.400
Think of it as the last
Christmas you'll ever spend alone.

31:37.800 --> 31:40.000
I locked it.

31:42.100 --> 31:46.000
- For your protection.
- Stay away from me.

31:46.200 --> 31:51.000
Look, I want you to get me out of here.
I am quite capable of pulling this trigger.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.400
I'm glad to hear it.

31:52.400 --> 31:56.200
You may well have to defend yourself
against that crazy partner of yours.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.200
What have you done with him?!

31:58.200 --> 32:02.500
Kept him safe from his own
mad devices, at least for now.

32:02.500 --> 32:06.600
Do you have any idea why he
brought you here to this house?

32:06.600 --> 32:10.700
Look, all I know is this is just some
bad dream. This is all in my head.

32:10.700 --> 32:14.900
Yet here you are waving a
gun at me like your partner.

32:15.300 --> 32:16.700
Scully!

32:18.000 --> 32:22.800
Do you realize how seriously
disturbed that man is?

32:22.800 --> 32:25.500
How dark and lonely?

32:25.500 --> 32:28.300
- What he's capable of?
- Scully?!

32:28.800 --> 32:32.500
- Mulder!
- Want your car keys?

32:35.200 --> 32:37.000
Where did you get those?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.700
He's got nowhere to go this Christmas.

32:39.700 --> 32:42.500
No one to go with.

32:42.500 --> 32:47.400
Did he happen to mention
a story about a lovers' pact?

32:47.600 --> 32:49.800
Where did you get those keys?

32:49.800 --> 32:53.400
The man is acting out
an unconscious yearning.

32:53.400 --> 32:57.800
The deep-seated terror of being alone.

33:00.800 --> 33:04.900
- Scully... Scully, are you there?!
- I'm here, Mulder!

33:04.900 --> 33:07.500
Open the door, Scully!

33:10.000 --> 33:12.200
Open the door.

33:25.800 --> 33:30.400
I've seen it happen too
many times in this house.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.900
I don't believe you.
Just open the door.

33:33.900 --> 33:36.500
- But...
- Open the door!

33:47.400 --> 33:49.900
- Where's Scully?
- Mulder?

33:58.400 --> 34:00.500
Mulder, what are you doing?

34:01.900 --> 34:03.100
Mulder!

34:04.800 --> 34:09.199
There's no getting out of here, Scully.
There's no way home.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.100
Mulder, come on...

34:12.100 --> 34:16.100
Mulder, don't come any closer.
You're scaring me. Put the gun down!

34:16.100 --> 34:19.400
- You going to shoot me?!
- I'm not going to shoot you!

34:19.400 --> 34:23.900
- I don't want to shoot you!
- It's me or you... You or me.

34:23.900 --> 34:28.699
- One of us has to do it.
- Mulder, look... We don't have to do this.

34:28.699 --> 34:31.100
- Oh, yes, we do.
- We can get out of here.

34:31.100 --> 34:35.300
Even if we could what's waiting for us?
More loneliness!

34:35.300 --> 34:39.300
And then 365 more shopping
days till even more loneliness!

34:39.300 --> 34:44.199
I don't believe what you're saying!
Mulder, I don't believe a word of it.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.700
Merry Christmas, Scully.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.100
And a happy New Year.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.000
Let me go!

35:44.100 --> 35:46.000
- Let me go!
- Mulder!

35:46.000 --> 35:49.600
Let me go... Let me go...

35:51.600 --> 35:53.500
Let me go!

35:54.400 --> 35:56.100
Scully!

36:00.700 --> 36:02.300
Scully?

36:04.100 --> 36:07.500
Mulder... Is that you?

36:10.200 --> 36:14.200
- What did you do?
- I didn't believe it, Mulder.

36:14.300 --> 36:16.400
You didn't believe what?

36:16.400 --> 36:19.800
I didn't believe that you'd do it...

36:19.900 --> 36:22.300
That I would...

36:24.700 --> 36:27.800
Merry Christmas, Mulder.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.700
What are you doing?

37:56.600 --> 37:58.300
Scully?

38:09.600 --> 38:11.300
Scully...

38:26.000 --> 38:28.700
Ah... I'm not going to make it.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
No, you're not...

38:32.400 --> 38:34.900
Not without me, you're not.

38:34.900 --> 38:38.000
Are you afraid, Mulder?

38:44.200 --> 38:46.400
I am.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.000
I am, too.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.100
You should have thought of this.

39:02.100 --> 39:05.100
- You should have.
- You shot me first!

39:05.100 --> 39:08.400
I didn't shoot you. You shot me.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.200
Scully...

39:24.400 --> 39:26.000
What?

39:30.800 --> 39:32.700
Get up.

39:33.800 --> 39:38.900
- I can't.
- Get up... You're not shot.

39:39.700 --> 39:40.900
What?

39:40.900 --> 39:45.300
Come on. It's a trick.
It's all in your head.

40:24.500 --> 40:27.000
You hear that?
It's Christmas.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.300
One for the books.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.400
We almost had those two, didn't we?

40:32.400 --> 40:34.400
Almost had them.

40:34.800 --> 40:40.300
- Two such lonely souls.
- We can't let our failures haunt us.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.500
You wonder what they were
really out here looking for.

40:44.500 --> 40:48.000
Hard to say. People now...

40:48.000 --> 40:51.900
This is just another joyless day of the year.

40:51.900 --> 40:55.200
- Not for us.
- No.

40:55.200 --> 40:59.600
We haven't forgotten
the meaning of Christmas.

41:14.900 --> 41:18.300
I don't deserve to be so happy.

41:20.600 --> 41:23.400
I can't help it.

41:24.700 --> 41:28.000
I just can't help it.

41:28.600 --> 41:34.100
Scrooge was better than his word. He
became as good a friend, as good a master and...

41:34.100 --> 41:36.600
...as good a man as the good old city ever knew...

41:36.600 --> 41:42.500
...or any other good old city, town or borough
in the good old world. And to Tiny Tim...

41:51.200 --> 41:53.100
I, uh...

41:53.100 --> 41:56.600
I couldn't sleep. I was, um...

41:57.600 --> 41:59.400
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

41:59.400 --> 42:03.600
Aren't you supposed to be opening
Christmas gifts with your family?

42:03.600 --> 42:05.700
Mulder...

42:05.700 --> 42:09.300
None of that really happened out there tonight...

42:09.300 --> 42:12.300
That was all in our heads, right?

42:13.800 --> 42:16.300
I-it must have been.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.300
Not that, uh, my only joy
in life is proving you wrong.

42:26.300 --> 42:30.000
When have you proven me wrong?

42:32.600 --> 42:35.700
Well... Why else would you
want me out there with you?

42:35.700 --> 42:38.000
You didn't want to be there?

42:40.100 --> 42:42.300
Oh, that's, um...

42:42.900 --> 42:45.900
That's self-righteous and...

42:45.900 --> 42:50.900
- Narcissistic of me to say, isn't it?
- No, I mean...

42:51.200 --> 42:55.300
Maybe I did want to be out there with you.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.800
Now, um...

43:01.800 --> 43:06.600
I know we said that we weren't
going to exchange gifts but, uh...

43:07.800 --> 43:11.300
I got you... a little something.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.500
Mulder...

43:14.500 --> 43:16.700
Merry Christmas.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
Well, I got you a little something, too.
