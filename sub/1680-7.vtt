WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.750
kids,everybody make mistakes

00:03.200 --> 00:04.850
Take this girl Meg for instance.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.350
She made a mistake, a mistake named Barney.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.850
Yeah I thought I was gonna get married to my last boyfriend

00:11.000 --> 00:14.250
but, boy, did that guy have commitment issues.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.850
That whole relaonship--

00:16.400 --> 00:18.850
that's three weeks of my life I'll never get back.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.750
Well, I love commitment.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.650
I wish I could marry commitment.

00:25.300 --> 00:25.590
I met a girl last night.

00:25.600 --> 00:26.650
Really?

00:26.900 --> 00:29.650
So perky and full of life and not at all fake.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.150
You're talking about her boobs, right?

00:31.600 --> 00:32.150
C?

00:32.600 --> 00:34.090
And that wasn't Spanish, that was cup size.

00:34.100 --> 00:34.750
What up?

00:37.300 --> 00:38.750
So, these boobs... Hmm.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.190
paint me a word picture.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.150
All right, Ted.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.450
Imagine the heads of two Irish babies. Mmm.

00:44.600 --> 00:45.550
Let's call them...

00:46.300 --> 00:46.650
and...

00:48.000 --> 00:48.650
Please stop!

00:50.400 --> 00:51.150
When you get married,

00:51.400 --> 00:52.850
you start out growing certain parts of your life.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.650
And for Lily and Marshall, those certain parts were,

00:56.000 --> 00:57.650
for the most part, me

01:01.100 --> 01:02.050
Why would you come in?

01:02.100 --> 01:02.950
You hear me shaving!

01:03.400 --> 01:04.849
I thought you were shaving your face!

01:05.200 --> 01:06.750
Well, clearly I wasn't!

01:07.100 --> 01:09.150
Oh! No, no!

01:09.700 --> 01:11.750
Pay up! Ugh! pussy!

01:13.400 --> 01:14.550
Guys,it's 3:00 in the morning

01:14.700 --> 01:16.150
and it reeks in here.

01:16.300 --> 01:17.250
Ted said it was okay.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.650
Ah, hey, Marshall.

01:19.000 --> 01:19.650
You're still up?

01:20.200 --> 01:21.250
Aren't you taking the bar tomorrow?

01:23.200 --> 01:25.350
Discontent was bubbling under this surface,

01:26.000 --> 01:26.650
until one day...

01:26.800 --> 01:27.150
Ted!

01:28.100 --> 01:30.250
How many times have I asked you to put the lid

01:30.400 --> 01:31.950
back on the peanut butter jar?

01:32.500 --> 01:34.350
It's this sort of incoiderate,

01:34.700 --> 01:36.550
immature jackassery

01:36.650 --> 01:38.150
that makes me feel like I'm living in the Realworld house,

01:39.200 --> 01:41.250
and not the early years when they all had jobs

01:41.400 --> 01:42.550
and social consciences.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.350
I'talking about Hawaii and after!

01:45.500 --> 01:47.150
I can't take this anymore!

01:47.500 --> 01:49.550
ted, Lily and I are married now!

01:49.800 --> 01:52.650
It's time! we're getting our own place!

01:53.800 --> 01:56.750
Actually, I left the lid open. Sorry, baby.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.250
But still,it was time to move forward.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.350
So, they set out to find a new apartment to rent.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.950
Hey, here's one.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.550
Prwar building, recently renovated,

02:05.700 --> 02:07.950
hardwood floors, tons of light,

02:08.199 --> 02:09.250
two bedroom, two bath.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.150
Oh, yeah, but that one's not for rent.

02:11.500 --> 02:12.150
It's for sale.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.150
Oh, right.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.090
Kids, Uncle Marshall always like to say

02:17.100 --> 02:19.150
that he had made three big mistakes in his life.

02:19.800 --> 02:20.550
This was the first.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.150
Jump, you big chicken!

02:22.400 --> 02:23.650
Jump! You afraidy cat!

02:23.700 --> 02:25.150
Jump! Jump!

02:25.500 --> 02:26.450
This was the second.

02:28.000 --> 02:28.650
No!

02:30.010 --> 02:31.450
And this was the third and biggest.

02:31.700 --> 02:32.750
We should buy a place!

02:33.300 --> 02:34.250
-What? -Baby,

02:34.500 --> 02:36.350
real estate is always a good invesent.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.150
It's not.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.550
And the market is really hot rightnow.

02:39.800 --> 02:40.450
It wasn't.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.050
And because of my new job,

02:42.100 --> 02:44.350
we are in such atrong place financially.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.150
They weren't.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.850
Because lily has a secret.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.150
My name is Lily and I'm a shopaholic.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.150
Hi, Lily.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.550
Oh, you guys don't do that here?

02:55.600 --> 02:55.950
Sorry.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.150
Proceed.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.350
I buy designer clothes and accessories that I can't afford.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.150
I have 15 creditcards and they're all maxed out.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.650
And no one outside of this room,

03:08.650 --> 03:10.350
not even my husband, knows.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.350
And I, I feel terrible

03:12.500 --> 03:14.450
becaus all I want to do right now

03:14.450 --> 03:16.050
is ask you where you got those shoes.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.050
They're adorable.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.050
we can't buy; we have debt.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.550
Yeah, I know,

03:21.600 --> 03:22.750
my student loans are pretty big.

03:23.100 --> 03:23.850
I forgive you.

03:24.600 --> 03:24.950
What?

03:25.600 --> 03:26.190
Well...

03:26.200 --> 03:27.650
I'm just saying as your wife,

03:28.200 --> 03:31.650
you know I'm cool that you spent tens of thousands of dollar

03:31.700 --> 03:33.050
on a brand name law school.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.750
cause I know it make you feel good and pretty.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.050
Let's just go take a look at this place.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.250
Where is it?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.950
Uh, it's in a neighborhood called..

03:46.000 --> 03:48.250
Dowisetrepla?
Dowisetrepla?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.350
Dowisetrepla
Dowisetrepla.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.090
Oh, I see, you're not New Yorkers.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.590
Oh, actually we live on the Upper West side, so...

03:55.600 --> 03:56.990
No need to be emrrassed, listen,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.650
here in New York we just shorten the names of all t ighborhos,

04:00.100 --> 04:02.690
So, TriBeC Nolita--

04:02.700 --> 04:03.550
oh, right.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.050
Dowisetrepla

04:05.200 --> 04:06.850
I'm, I'm from New York.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.050
I know this nighborhood.

04:08.250 --> 04:09.950
i am down in the D-town

04:10.500 --> 04:12.050
Oh, well nobody calls it D-town.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.550
Dowisetrepla

04:13.600 --> 04:15.250
the up-and-coming neighborhood.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.089
And I have to tell you, for the prices

04:17.089 --> 04:18.390

04:18.399 --> 04:20.750
I'm, I'm gonna stop you right there.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.490
Don't bother with the hard sell.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.490
This place is, is way out of our price range,

04:24.500 --> 04:26.550
and besides, we've only just started to looking.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.150
Is what Marshall should he said.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.050
I'm gonna stop you right there.

04:49.800 --> 04:50.950
I've never been to this neighborhood.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.250
kind of thought this part of town was water.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.150
No, dude.

04:55.700 --> 04:56.950
This is Dowisetrepla.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.650
Dowisetrepla? Yeah.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.250
Is that abbreviation for something?

05:02.100 --> 05:03.150
He'from Ohio.

05:04.700 --> 05:07.450
Dowiatrepla is th up-a-coming neighborhood. Oh.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.550
I think this right the place where Lily and I start a family

05:11.800 --> 05:12.650
I can see it now

05:15.100 --> 05:16.350
Two three,four.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.350
All right, bring it home, boys.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.250
Sounds great, boys.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.950
Who wants chocolate pancakes?

05:27.600 --> 05:29.150
Thanks, Mommy!

05:32.000 --> 05:32.350
Man,

05:32.900 --> 05:34.150
life is gonna be sweet!

05:35.200 --> 05:37.550
oh, my God, Lily, have you seen this kitchen?

05:38.000 --> 05:40.550
I know. It's... Isn't it amazing?

05:40.800 --> 05:42.950
-I just love it so... -What the hell are you doin

05:43.400 --> 05:44.550
You can't buy this place.

05:44.550 --> 05:46.850
Lily you have a debt the size of Mount Waddington!

05:46.900 --> 05:47.850
Waddington?

05:48.200 --> 05:49.590
It's the tallest mountain in Canada.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.250
It's like 4,000 meters high.

05:51.700 --> 05:52.050
Meters?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.250
Don't let Marshall fa in love with this apartmt.

05:55.700 --> 05:56.950
I know, I know, I know, I know

05:57.200 --> 05:58.450
but what do i tell him?

05:58.800 --> 06:00.050
I-I don't know, tell him,

06:00.300 --> 06:01.950
tell him you saw a ghost. Tell him it's haunted.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.150
You really don'know Marshall at all.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.750
So, uh, the owners,where are they? Oh.

06:10.100 --> 06:13.150
-They're on vacation in France for two weeks. -I see.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.450
Between you and me,

06:14.500 --> 06:16.850
I'm also interested in the artment.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.250
So is there any way I could come back later and check it out

06:20.300 --> 06:21.950
while you're showing them other places?

06:22.200 --> 06:24.250
The lockbox combination is 1421.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.550
And heres my card.

06:30.200 --> 06:30.950
Are you serious?

06:31.100 --> 06:33.150
You're trying to sneak this apartment away from Marshall and Lily

06:33.300 --> 06:36.050
Ted, do you think I have no morals whatsoever?

06:36.500 --> 06:39.750
I simply want to fool a girl into thinking this is my apartment

06:39.800 --> 06:41.950
so I can nail her once and never have to see her again.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.050
I'm not a monster.

06:43.700 --> 06:44.690
Now, listen I don't want to put a lot of pressure on you,

06:44.700 --> 06:49.350
but there is one other couple that expressed very serious interest.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.350
I see what you're doing here.

06:52.300 --> 06:53.450
"Another couple."

06:53.800 --> 06:54.250
Please

06:54.900 --> 06:57.150
That crap is page one out of the Realtor's playbook.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.750
And we're not buying it.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.150
Is what Marshall should have said.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.350
Another couple? No!

07:03.000 --> 07:05.350
We want it. Sell it to us. We'll give you so much more money.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.150
Oh Marshall, can I talk to you?

07:09.900 --> 07:10.550
Marshall, I just...

07:11.300 --> 07:13.350
I don't know if now is the right time to buy.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.250
But we're not doing this for now,

07:15.400 --> 07:16.650
we're doing this for our future.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.050
Can't you imagine starting a family here?

07:23.300 --> 07:25.650
Oh, Persephone!Oh Daphne!

07:25.800 --> 07:27.350
These'll be perfect additions

07:27.350 --> 07:30.150
to our upcoming mother-daughter exhibit at the Met.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.550
Looks great, girls.

07:34.100 --> 07:35.650
Who wants crapes of chocolate?

07:36.300 --> 07:38.250
Merci, papa.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.050
So... what do you guys think?

07:43.200 --> 07:45.150
I love it, but Marshall,

07:45.800 --> 07:48.150
I should have told you this long time ago.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.250
We can't afford to buy an apartment.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.950
because I have too much credit card debt.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.550
I am so sorry.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.150
Is what she should have said.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.650
I love it. Let's get it.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.250
Can we charge it?

08:02.200 --> 08:03.090
To Lily and Marshall

08:03.100 --> 08:05.350
and their momentous step forward into adulthood.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.150
Cheers.

08:07.300 --> 08:09.150
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Drink it!

08:10.100 --> 08:12.050
Yes! Well done. Nice! Yeah!

08:12.500 --> 08:13.250
Anything else?

08:13.300 --> 08:14.050
Yes.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.050
I've been staring at that thing for years.

08:17.400 --> 08:17.750
Wendy

08:18.300 --> 08:21.450
bring me the comically large bottle of champagne.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.390
Really? Are you sure?

08:25.400 --> 08:26.950
It's neve been refrigerated.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.150
And I think at some point there was a fish in it.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.549
Honey, once you've made the sale,stop selling.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.549
All right, but you guys have to help me carry it.

08:35.799 --> 08:39.190
All right, let's do it. Let'do this.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.250
I know what you're thinking.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.850
I should tell Marshall the truth

08:43.000 --> 08:44.250
I've got the whole thing figure out.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.950
We'll apply for the loan under Marshall's name,

08:47.000 --> 08:48.150
and h'll never need to know.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.450
And then in the meantime, I'll slowly work down debt.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.950
Right after I furnish the apartment.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.750
I saw this amazing leather sofa today.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.350
You should be a reality show.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.450
Nice! Nice.

09:03.200 --> 09:03.550
Wait!

09:04.100 --> 09:05.590
That cork is the size of a softball

09:05.600 --> 09:08.250
and you're pointing it directly at Wendy the waitress's face.

09:08.900 --> 09:09.850
Is what he should have said.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.050
Now if you are thinking about buying an apartment,

09:14.400 --> 09:15.850
it's always good to check the place out at night.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.550
Welcome to my humble abode.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.150
This place is so nice.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.150
Ah, make yourself at home.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.450
Please, get comfortable.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.150
If you see something you like, just take it.

09:27.800 --> 09:28.750
Who are these people?

09:29.100 --> 09:30.450
Uh... that's my parents.

09:31.300 --> 09:32.850
They're Asian.

09:33.800 --> 09:34.150
Yeah.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.190
They're a Chinese couple that wanted a white baby

09:37.200 --> 09:37.650
It works both ways.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.850
Cookie. Wow.

09:41.300 --> 09:42.350
Did you make those?

09:42.900 --> 09:46.350
You got me. My sisters taught me how to bake and how to listen.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.050
I feel so at home here.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.150
I'm glad.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.950
Sometimes, I don't.

09:53.950 --> 09:56.050
A place like this really needs a lady of the house.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.850
I know it's early to be thinking of you as...

09:59.300 --> 10:01.150
Oh, God I'm freaking you out, aren't I?

10:02.200 --> 10:03.250
It's just  you make me feel so safe.

10:03.700 --> 10:04.550
I didn't...

10:07.300 --> 10:08.150
The next day

10:08.150 --> 10:10.250
Lily and Marshall went to the mortgage broker to get a loan.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.290
Hey, uh, can we get this in singles?

10:12.300 --> 10:14.390
Before we get the apartment I want to put in a kiddie pool

10:14.400 --> 10:15.550
and swim around in it naked.

10:18.100 --> 10:18.890
Great, that is great

10:18.900 --> 10:19.250
Thank you.

10:20.400 --> 10:20.750
Thank you.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.850
Okay! all right, back to business.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.850
All right, Mrs. Aldrin, I'm going to need your social as well.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.350
What? Why?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.150
I mean, you already have Marshall's.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.250
Yes, but since you're a married couple,

10:32.300 --> 10:34.350
you'll be applying for a joint loan, so.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.050
Well, can we just go ahead an do it in my husband's name?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.350
He is the head of the household.

10:40.700 --> 10:41.750
He earns the big bucks.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.550
I mean, can women even own property?

10:45.600 --> 10:47.500
Go ahead, just give him your social.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.750
Okay my... my social is, uh...

10:53.000 --> 10:53.350
Got it.

10:55.700 --> 10:58.450
Let's see what kind of rate I can get you two.

10:58.470 --> 11:00.080
Under six percent Under six percent.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.880
Under six percent,please.

11:02.330 --> 11:04.530
There we go Congratulation

11:04.690 --> 11:06.030
You ve been approved for a loan

11:06.030 --> 11:07.430
18%
at 18%.

11:08.820 --> 11:10.630
No, way. That-that can't be right.

11:11.150 --> 11:12.410
You' lucky to be getting mortgage.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.280
Let's get out of here, Marshall.

11:14.510 --> 11:16.260
Hold it, I-I don't undersnd.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.400
did we do mething wrong or...?

11:18.580 --> 11:19.880
You have quite a bit of debt.

11:20.220 --> 11:22.340
My student loans.Great.

11:22.770 --> 11:23.720
I thought we were friends.

11:23.960 --> 11:24.780
You know what, it's fine

11:24.780 --> 11:26.080
to penalize me for trying

11:26.080 --> 11:27.460
to get an education and bud a career,

11:27.460 --> 11:29.710
but I will not let you deprive my beautiful wife

11:29.710 --> 11:31.250
of her dream home just because I...

11:31.250 --> 11:34.110
Okay, actually, it's because of youwife's credit card debt.

11:39.530 --> 11:40.570
Oh my God.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.900
Marshall, there's something I have to tell you,

11:46.330 --> 11:48.270
and I want you to hear it from me first.

11:54.610 --> 11:56.590
Okay,  let me get this straight.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.450
You just snuck this girl into some stranger's apartment?

11:59.650 --> 12:00.770
yeah, we spent the night.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.070
Hey, look at you.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.430
I'm wearing your bathrobe.

12:08.810 --> 12:09.620
I hope you don't mind.

12:10.010 --> 12:11.170
The only thing missing from that bathrobe

12:11.170 --> 12:12.240
are your initials.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.300
My mom's gonna be in town next week.

12:18.260 --> 12:19.930
Is iokay if she stays with us?

12:21.210 --> 12:23.410
Only if she sleeps in the bed

12:23.410 --> 12:24.940
and I sleep on the couch.

12:25.590 --> 12:27.330
You're so sweet.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.110
I love you.

12:28.940 --> 12:31.530
There, I said it and I'm not taking it back.

12:31.890 --> 12:34.130
Oh, my God! I love you, too.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.810
I'm finally not the first one to say it!

12:37.910 --> 12:39.720
How about you get in the shower,

12:40.280 --> 12:42.220
and I will make us some waffles.

12:58.590 --> 12:59.590
Works every time.

13:00.690 --> 13:01.290
Wait.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.120
That time that you offered to walk my dogs

13:03.280 --> 13:04.770
when I went to visit my dad in Vancouver...

13:05.290 --> 13:06.010
Yup.

13:06.580 --> 13:07.730
Is that why my Yorkie trembled

13:07.730 --> 13:09.570
for like a week after I got back?

13:09.810 --> 13:10.540
Yeah.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.050
That little guy saw some stuff I'm not proud of.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.720
-Wh.  -What?

13:17.600 --> 13:19.140
There was a fight here.

13:19.350 --> 13:19.850
What do you mean?

13:20.510 --> 13:22.670
whenever Mshall anLily have a big argument, they always

13:22.790 --> 13:24.810
leave a trail of evidence all over the apament.

13:25.150 --> 13:26.510
Oh, god, here we go.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.870
He had a detective club as a kid.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.590
Uh, the Mosby Boys

13:30.590 --> 13:32.130
cracked a lot of big cases

13:32.690 --> 13:33.600
The Mosby Boys?

13:34.260 --> 13:35.320
You mean you and your sister.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.330
We solved the mystery of the missing retainer.

13:38.530 --> 13:39.200
let me guess

13:39.200 --> 13:40.610
it was in the garbage.

13:41.980 --> 13:42.870
Why are you like this?

13:44.370 --> 13:45.370
Anyway, this is serious.

13:45.750 --> 13:46.930
I know Lily and Marshall.

13:47.090 --> 13:48.490
All the tell tale signs are here.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.300
Like this

13:50.860 --> 13:52.580
-A water bott? -Don't touch the evidence

13:53.770 --> 13:54.770
I got your back partner.

13:55.870 --> 13:57.090
It's not stny water bottle.

13:58.150 --> 14:00.130
Notice the label is peed off.

14:01.050 --> 14:02.560
Lily always peels labels off

14:02.560 --> 14:04.370
the bottle when she's feeling guilty.

14:05.020 --> 14:08.350
This lab is not only peele off, but torn up

14:09.810 --> 14:13.590
Oh, man, she must have done something bad.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.290
Which means Marshall must have been really angry,

14:16.290 --> 14:17.900
and when Marshall gets rely angry.

14:19.260 --> 14:19.920
he eats.

14:28.020 --> 14:28.880
Just as I suspected,

14:29.940 --> 14:30.940
Cherry Garcia.

14:32.670 --> 14:33.940
Given the liquid consistency,

14:35.490 --> 14:39.770
I place the fight between... noon and 1.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.830
Ew, that was on the floor.

14:42.540 --> 14:43.280
If you want to get to the bottom of this,

14:43.280 --> 14:45.450
you're gonna need a stronger stomach than that, doll-face.

14:46.770 --> 14:47.620
Marshall stood here.

14:48.810 --> 14:50.800
Eating and yelling, yelling and eating.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.430
Lily stood here.

14:54.670 --> 14:55.580
Crying.

14:55.580 --> 14:56.810
Ew, Ted.

14:57.420 --> 14:58.750
And thenarshall tried to

14:58.750 --> 14:59.750
storm out...

15:01.030 --> 15:04.360
but Lily went for the Hail Marpass.

15:07.530 --> 15:08.390
Which would mean...

15:13.940 --> 15:15.590
What do u think, makeup sex?

15:15.590 --> 15:17.620
There'd be a bigger mess.

15:18.180 --> 15:20.210
Tempted as he was, Marshall was still too upset.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.330
He had to get out of here, any way he cld.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.160
He chosehe doo

15:25.260 --> 15:26.340
slamming it bend him.

15:27.090 --> 15:28.760
Whh is why this picture is crooked.

15:29.230 --> 15:30.540
Nice catch, robin.

15:30.780 --> 15:33.080
I'll jus uh, take this down to the lab.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.870
Now alwe need  a motive.

15:37.430 --> 15:38.880
The milln-dollar question.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.250
at were they fighting about?

15:40.250 --> 15:41.300
I ow what they've been fighting...

15:41.300 --> 15:42.830
Bup, bup, bu b, bup, bup.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.930
There's only one possible conclusion.

15:45.890 --> 15:48.260
Li and Marshall're fighting about

15:49.630 --> 15:50.840
-peanut butter. -Ah.

15:51.650 --> 15:52.920
Lily left the lid off...

15:54.550 --> 15:56.550
and mashall blew heads

15:58.590 --> 15:59.800
I know what they were fighting about,

15:59.800 --> 16:00.790
and it wasn't peanut butter.

16:01.010 --> 16:02.980
Robin, just... I appreciate your help,

16:03.320 --> 16:05.400
but there's a reason you name is Robin, not Batman.

16:06.000 --> 16:06.510
Just...

16:07.250 --> 16:09.030
They were fighting because they didn't get the loan

16:09.030 --> 16:10.120
and it's all Lily's fault.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.600
Robin, just... What?

16:12.570 --> 16:14.750
Yeah, she has a pile of debt the size of Mount...

16:14.850 --> 16:15.950
Rushmore

16:16.690 --> 16:17.480
Nice try, Robin.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.290
So, the next thing Lily did

16:19.530 --> 16:21.370
was give Marshall a few hours to cool off about

16:21.370 --> 16:23.000
the peanut butter.

16:24.050 --> 16:24.680
Then she called him

16:24.680 --> 16:28.960
to apologize, which is why the last number dialed is...

16:29.480 --> 16:31.330
Greenstein and Lee, Divorce Attorneys.

16:33.830 --> 16:35.000
This can't be happening.

16:35.410 --> 16:37.310
They can't... get divorced.

16:37.710 --> 16:39.290
Not Lily and Marshall, no way.

16:39.590 --> 16:40.900
Well, it's been nice knowing you guys.

16:41.290 --> 16:42.420
What do you mean? Well..

16:42.760 --> 16:44.650
Marshall's gonna get you guys, Lily's gonna get me.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.780
even if they did break up, that doesn't mean

16:46.780 --> 16:47.820
we can't all ill hangout.

16:47.850 --> 16:50.390
I mean we broke up and we still hang out. It's not weird.

16:50.870 --> 16:51.590
It's a little weird.

16:52.330 --> 16:54.180
Yeah, it is. It's weird.

16:56.560 --> 16:57.420
The world needs

16:57.420 --> 16:59.850
Marshall and Lily... together.

17:02.030 --> 17:04.640
I'm not crying, there's something in my eye.

17:06.900 --> 17:07.450
They're back.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.329
Hey, hey, guys.

17:13.150 --> 17:14.599
We have annnouncement.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.770
I know, it's a terrible idea.

17:16.770 --> 17:18.000
You can't do it!

17:19.190 --> 17:20.510
Just look at me.

17:23.819 --> 17:25.089
I hit redial on the phone.

17:25.390 --> 17:26.560
Divorce lawyers?

17:26.770 --> 17:28.760
Oh, I should explain.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.480
We got in a pretty big fight.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.970
Yeah, I know.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.650
Marshall stormed out.

17:35.990 --> 17:37.260
I went, uh, to the bar.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.460
still drinking that?

17:41.390 --> 17:42.520
I paid for it.

17:42.990 --> 17:45.250
And apparently money's tight now, so...

17:46.600 --> 17:49.260
Listen, I've been thinking about this,

17:49.900 --> 17:52.070
and I know there's no way to undo what I've done,

17:52.070 --> 17:55.790
but, well, I made an appointment with a divorce lawyer.

17:55.790 --> 17:57.050
What?! What?!

17:57.050 --> 17:57.850
Oh no, no, no, no-no.

17:57.850 --> 17:59.280
-What, you want a divorce now? -No.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.710
I just mean on paper,

18:00.710 --> 18:02.240
so that you can buy the apartment

18:02.240 --> 18:04.980
-without my bad credit dragging us down. -Lily...

18:05.530 --> 18:06.980
are you trying to kill me?

18:08.120 --> 18:10.490
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have led with the divorce lawyer part.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.650
No, you shouldn't have

18:14.520 --> 18:15.430
I love you, Lily.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.210
I love you, too.

18:17.820 --> 18:19.810
And I want us to have our dream home.

18:21.750 --> 18:22.650
And, well, I don't know.

18:22.650 --> 18:24.320
It seems like this is a way to do it.

18:25.550 --> 18:26.410
So...

18:27.030 --> 18:28.290
Marsllriksen,

18:28.990 --> 18:29.990
will you divorce me?

18:32.030 --> 18:34.060
That's the sweetest divorce proposal I've ever heard.

18:34.850 --> 18:35.750
So is that a yes?

18:36.090 --> 18:37.470
You can't sleep with other women though.

18:37.930 --> 18:40.190
No, we're not getting divorced,

18:40.190 --> 18:41.590
not even on paper.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.630
When I married you, I married your problems, too.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.070
The ones I knew about and the ones I didn't.

18:48.930 --> 18:50.740
So, that was the deal.

18:50.890 --> 18:51.890
We'll figure this out together.

18:56.590 --> 18:57.720
Can I get you guys anything else?

19:00.750 --> 19:02.200
you're not getting a divorce?

19:02.850 --> 19:03.600
No. Wow, you guys

19:03.720 --> 19:05.800
scared us. Oh, thank God.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.650
Cause, I mean if you did,

19:08.650 --> 19:11.660
then who'd be the lame married couple I get to make fun of?

19:11.820 --> 19:14.220
Like, "Hey, Marshall, you married Miss Right.

19:14.730 --> 19:16.400
You just didn't know her first name was Always."

19:16.740 --> 19:18.370
That stuff is cold.

19:21.220 --> 19:22.760
So, what's the announcement?

19:24.150 --> 19:25.490
I just got off the phone with the Realtor.

19:25.490 --> 19:28.770
We told her that, uh, because of our finances,

19:28.770 --> 19:29.580
we're not getting the place.

19:29.580 --> 19:30.940
It's just-- it's not the right time.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.640
Is what Marshall should have said.

19:33.410 --> 19:35.130
I just got off the phone with the Realtor.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.010
We got the place!

19:37.010 --> 19:38.300
We' re home on earth!

19:38.770 --> 19:40.250
Are you insane?

19:40.250 --> 19:40.790
Have you lost your mind?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.010
Is what we should have said.

19:42.850 --> 19:45.960
Yeah!

19:51.400 --> 19:51.970
Aw! This is exciting!

19:51.970 --> 19:53.690
Yeah. There it is!

19:54.470 --> 19:55.470
Our new home.

19:57.490 --> 19:58.030
Shall we?

19:58.460 --> 19:59.190
We shall.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.010
Oh! what a horrible smell.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.300
It reeks.

20:07.580 --> 20:08.540
Oh, that's just the plant.

20:09.050 --> 20:10.630
Don't worry, they shut it down on the weekends.

20:11.070 --> 20:12.140
Wh-What plant?

20:12.140 --> 20:13.400
What are you talking about?

20:13.880 --> 20:14.470
Don't you know?

20:14.940 --> 20:16.550
Baby, this whole neighborhood is downwind

20:16.550 --> 20:17.730
of the sewage treatment plant.

20:19.910 --> 20:22.380
Wait... what did you just say?

20:23.890 --> 20:27.310
I said, we're downwind of the sewage treatment plant.
