00:02.001 --> 00:03.742
Turner: Previously
on "Gotham Knights"...

00:03.786 --> 00:05.309
We've been set up!

00:05.353 --> 00:06.528
Turner: We're gonna find
who really killed my dad.

00:06.571 --> 00:07.311
Lincoln!

00:08.530 --> 00:10.184
Chill: Maybe the Court
finds you useful.

00:10.227 --> 00:13.317
You'll find out
soon enough.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.276
Duela: You almost
got kabobbed getting
Daddy's diary.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.060
Was it worth it?

00:17.104 --> 00:18.714
You ever stop to think
maybe you are, too?

00:18.757 --> 00:20.237
Turner:
The first thing my dad
and I bonded over

00:20.281 --> 00:21.630
was the fact that
we both understood

00:21.673 --> 00:23.240
how it felt to have
your parents murdered.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.589
I can't help thinking
the most important pages

00:24.633 --> 00:26.548
were the ones that
were ripped out.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.115
Court leader: The map
has finally been found.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.030
Soon, we will have Electrum.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.727
Turner: Take the map.
Meet back at the truck.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.511
I can do this myself.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.035
Turner: Err!

00:35.078 --> 00:36.340
Turner hasn't
made it back yet?

00:36.384 --> 00:37.689
We don't even know
where he is.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.039
OK. Then we find him.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.953
This is not just
about my survival.

00:40.997 --> 00:42.607
This is about Gotham's.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.218
[Slice]

00:44.261 --> 00:46.524
Leader: No. We have plans
for this one.

00:46.568 --> 00:48.135
Harvey: Why did I wake up
with no memory

00:48.178 --> 00:49.527
of how I got there?

00:49.571 --> 00:51.094
I don't have any alibi.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.446
[Sirens, helicopter flying]

00:55.490 --> 00:57.144
Reporter: It was
a grisly discovery here

00:57.187 --> 00:59.885
at Robinson Park
as the GCPD were called

00:59.929 --> 01:02.497
to the scene early this morning
after an unsuspecting jogger

01:02.540 --> 01:05.413
out on her usual run
came upon human remains.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.893
OK. And this just in.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.460
We've just received
confirmation

01:09.504 --> 01:11.419
the body found here
at Robinson Park

01:11.462 --> 01:14.030
has been identified
as Cressida Clarke,

01:14.074 --> 01:16.076
longtime attachÃ©
of the late Bruce Wayne.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.902
The GCPD has released
few details

01:17.947 --> 01:19.470
surrounding Ms. Clarke's death,

01:19.514 --> 01:21.168
but given
the disturbing manner

01:21.211 --> 01:22.908
in which her body
was discovered

01:22.952 --> 01:25.085
and her ties to Bruce Wayne,
Gotham has to wonder--

01:25.128 --> 01:27.435
are these two deaths connected?

01:37.836 --> 01:39.621
Reporter, on radio: Police are
canvassing neighborhoods

01:39.664 --> 01:42.232
around Robinson Park
in an effort to find

01:42.276 --> 01:43.625
potential witnesses who may have
seen or heard anything...

01:43.668 --> 01:45.017
[Knock on door]

01:45.061 --> 01:46.584
that could shed more light...

01:46.628 --> 01:48.630
Aja, we have anything
on the Clarke murder yet?

01:48.673 --> 01:51.633
Just got the initial
police report
from Soto's office.

01:51.676 --> 01:54.070
What are the headlines?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.941
Time of death was
about 6 hours
before she was found.

01:55.985 --> 01:57.813
Based on evidence
at the scene,

01:57.856 --> 01:59.728
it looks like
the body was moved
post-mortem,

01:59.771 --> 02:02.426
and they're looking
at Turner Hayes for this.

02:02.470 --> 02:05.560
Turner? There's no way
he did this.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.692
She's got a hole
clean through her.

02:07.736 --> 02:10.217
GCPD likes
the sword M.O.

02:10.259 --> 02:13.307
but not as much
as they like his DNA
under his fingernails.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.743
That doesn't mean
he killed her.

02:14.786 --> 02:17.224
Mr. Dent,
all due respect,

02:17.267 --> 02:19.487
I know you had
a relationship with him,

02:19.530 --> 02:22.533
but you always tell me
you have to trust
the evidence,

02:22.577 --> 02:24.448
and the evidence
points to Turner.

02:24.492 --> 02:28.060
What I have to do is
uncover the truth,

02:28.103 --> 02:29.366
whatever that may be.

02:54.957 --> 02:55.958
[Sighs]

02:59.179 --> 03:01.224
How could you do that?

03:01.268 --> 03:04.009
After all of the times
that Turner risked
his ass for you guys,

03:04.053 --> 03:05.794
you just abandon him
to the Court of Owls?

03:05.837 --> 03:08.057
Duela: Hey, hey!
I'm in the choir, blondie.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.580
-Let's preach to these heathens.
-If we'd have gone after him,

03:09.624 --> 03:10.973
we'd all be dead,
and there'd be

03:11.016 --> 03:12.366
no one else left
to save Turner.

03:12.409 --> 03:13.758
Yeah! So you just
saved yourselves.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.543
Congratulations!
Harper: Hey. Pointing

03:15.586 --> 03:17.153
the finger is not
gonna bring him back.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.676
No, but it does show
you who you can
count on.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.722
You don't get to lecture
anyone about team spirit.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.767
You left us for dead
in Wayne Tower to go
fence a watch.

03:22.811 --> 03:25.640
Yeah, and Turner
saved me anyway

03:25.683 --> 03:27.207
because he would never
leave one of us behind

03:27.250 --> 03:28.904
the way that we
just left him.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.906
There's still time
to save him, OK?

03:30.949 --> 03:32.341
We all heard what
the Court said.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.170
They have plans
for him.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.954
Wait. What plans?

03:35.998 --> 03:38.218
Duela: Well,
I'm betting they
don't include

03:38.261 --> 03:39.828
asking for vocal tips
from the former
glee club president.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.960
If their plans included
a body bag,

03:42.004 --> 03:43.614
they would have found
him right alongside Cressida.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.180
I'm more concerned
with our plan.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.704
-What plan?
-The one we're gonna need

03:46.748 --> 03:48.140
to go in
and save Turner.

03:48.184 --> 03:49.838
Cullen: Go in where?
We have no idea

03:49.881 --> 03:51.448
where they took him,
and it's not like we know

03:51.492 --> 03:52.710
when to pop by
their next soiree

03:52.754 --> 03:54.103
to celebrate
stealing a painting!

03:54.146 --> 03:56.453
Which is actually a map,

03:56.497 --> 04:00.370
which just leads
to nowhere.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.372
Stephanie: What do you mean?
Cullen: This map's supposed

04:02.416 --> 04:03.982
to lead the Court to their
last stash of Electrum,

04:04.026 --> 04:05.636
but it's just a map
of Old Gotham.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.159
There's no X
marks the spot,

04:07.203 --> 04:08.291
nothing to indicate
where it might be,

04:08.335 --> 04:09.249
nothing.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.472
Stephanie: Don't artists
usually sign their work

04:15.516 --> 04:17.430
in one of the lower
corners of a piece?

04:17.474 --> 04:19.737
Cullen:
Yeah, they do. Why?

04:19.781 --> 04:22.000
That's not where Alan Wayne
initialed this map.

04:22.043 --> 04:23.263
Look!

04:24.786 --> 04:26.135
Huh. Yeah.
That is weird.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.745
I didn't even
notice that.

04:27.789 --> 04:30.661
Duela: OK. So Alan Wayne
was an artistic noob?

04:30.705 --> 04:32.837
Stephanie: Or he knew
exactly what he was doing

04:32.881 --> 04:35.971
and this is his version
of X marks the spot.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.712
OK. So we don't know
where the Court is,

04:37.755 --> 04:39.453
but we know what
they're looking for, right?

04:39.496 --> 04:41.106
Electrum. So if we could
get there first, then--

04:41.150 --> 04:43.413
We can leverage the Electrum
to save Turner.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.980
Carrie: I want to
save Turner as much
as you do,

04:45.023 --> 04:46.503
but giving the Court
exactly what they want

04:46.547 --> 04:47.983
seems like maybe
a bad idea.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.289
What other choice
do we have?

05:07.785 --> 05:11.049
Wayne Manor.

05:11.093 --> 05:12.529
Why am I here?

05:15.271 --> 05:17.273
What do you want
with me?

05:17.317 --> 05:20.015
My answer hasn't
changed.

05:20.058 --> 05:23.018
I will never join you

05:23.061 --> 05:24.367
or give up my friends.

05:28.937 --> 05:32.070
You killed my dad,

05:32.114 --> 05:34.856
so if you're gonna
kill me, too,

05:34.899 --> 05:37.511
you might as well just
get it over with.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.339
I don't want to
kill you.

05:46.128 --> 05:47.347
You.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.700
Contrary to what
you may believe...

05:54.528 --> 05:56.007
I'm not your enemy.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.404
Why would you show
your face?

06:01.448 --> 06:03.580
Because I believe you
deserve to see the truth
behind the mask.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.369
And not just mine.

06:15.113 --> 06:16.724
This will help.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.203
Aah!

06:18.247 --> 06:19.901
Ugh! Agh!

06:19.944 --> 06:22.556
Bruce Wayne wasn't the man
you think he was,

06:22.599 --> 06:24.906
and deep down, I suspect
you feel that.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.777
Ergh!

06:26.821 --> 06:28.692
Just been too afraid...

06:28.736 --> 06:30.477

Well, here I am. Come on.

Man, on radio:
When you're done there,

09:28.306 --> 09:29.569
move the crew
to the south side.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.800
-You're good at math, right?
-Impressively.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.368
What are the chances
that a geological study

09:46.411 --> 09:49.197
is randomly occurring
at this very moment in time

09:49.240 --> 09:51.852
in the exact place
we believe Alan Wayne
hid the Electrum?

09:51.895 --> 09:54.855
Well, if probability
equals the number
of favorable outcomes

09:54.898 --> 09:57.858
divided by the number
of total outcomes,
I'd say zero.

09:59.642 --> 10:02.210
Wait. Do you recognize
that name?

10:02.253 --> 10:04.212
Gotham Geo.
That's a company

10:04.255 --> 10:06.214
from the McKillen ledger.

10:06.257 --> 10:07.258
One of the fronts
the Court uses to
wash their cash.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.999
They beat us here.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.610
Well, if they're
digging for Electrum,

10:10.653 --> 10:12.786
it doesn't look like
they've found it yet.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.962
There is one way
to find out.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.050
May I?

10:17.921 --> 10:18.835
Hmm.

-I'm not really feeling it.
-Wait. I'm sorry.

as bait?

a few decades.

Do you have
a better idea?

10:28.410 --> 10:29.324
Uh...

10:30.847 --> 10:34.242
Fine. Allow me.

10:34.285 --> 10:37.637

desperate measurements.

[Breathy voice] Hey there,
Mr. Construction Worker

10:40.640 --> 10:44.818
in your hard hat,
h-how deep can you dig?

10:44.861 --> 10:47.559
Uh, it's a distraction,
not a seduction.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.605
Why was I nominated
to be the distraction?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.172
Because you're...

10:52.782 --> 10:53.914
very distracting.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.306
Now go.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.881
Excuse me, sir. Heh.

11:04.925 --> 11:08.319
Hi. I'm sorry.
I...think I'm lost.

11:08.363 --> 11:11.105
Um, I was wondering
if maybe you could help me.

11:11.148 --> 11:14.499
Oh. Yeah. Sure thing.
What you looking for?

11:14.543 --> 11:18.329
Thank you. I was told
there was a coffee cart
in the vicinity. Is that--

11:18.373 --> 11:20.288
Uh, what you want
to do is take
this path here

11:20.331 --> 11:22.899
over to the next bend,
and it's right
over the hill.

11:22.943 --> 11:26.598
Great. Just this way.
Thank you so much. Thanks!

11:29.166 --> 11:31.212
Man, no radio: Marty said
he hit something. What was it?

11:31.255 --> 11:33.736
Second man:
Another bike frame.
That makes 3 bikes,

11:33.780 --> 11:36.173
2 dead raccoons,
and a literal
mountain of clay.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.001
Man: Then keep digging.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.394
Look. We're coming up
on the 20th hour here.

11:39.437 --> 11:40.830
Wouldn't it be easier
if we knew

11:40.874 --> 11:42.223
what were
we looking for?

11:42.266 --> 11:43.485
If they wanted us to know,
they'd tell us.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.052
Now dig.
We're losing daylight.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.662
[Static]

11:46.706 --> 11:49.447
So how do we
want to play this?

11:49.491 --> 11:51.188
We could sneak onto the site
after nightfall,

11:51.232 --> 11:52.842
do our own dig.

11:52.886 --> 11:54.539
Unless they get
there first.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.107
Any chance Cullen has
work boots and a hard hat?

11:57.151 --> 11:58.848
I'm sorry. Did you
change your hair

11:58.892 --> 12:03.113
and this
general area?

12:03.157 --> 12:05.550
Way to help the team
brainstorm.

12:05.594 --> 12:08.118
Cullen: Uh, guys,
get over here.

12:08.162 --> 12:09.946
What if they haven't
found Electrum because

12:09.990 --> 12:11.818
they're digging
in the wrong spot?

12:11.861 --> 12:14.298
These holes have been
bugging me.

12:14.342 --> 12:17.867
Look. They're way too clean
to be wear and tear.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.957
They're deliberate,
some sort of pattern,

12:21.001 --> 12:23.264
a pattern the Court
couldn't see with the map
in its frame,

12:23.307 --> 12:27.094
but--but what if it's not
a map with holes in it?

12:27.137 --> 12:29.966
What if it's something else?
What if...

12:32.882 --> 12:34.754
what if the holes
are the map?

12:39.323 --> 12:41.848
Harper: What do you think,
a constellation?

12:41.891 --> 12:44.764
Duela: No.

12:44.807 --> 12:48.419
What? We're really
gonna group doubt
a Sagittarius?

12:48.463 --> 12:51.988
Carrie: Doesn't look
like Morse code either.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.773
What does it look like
if you connect them?

13:08.657 --> 13:09.919
Harper: It's starting
to look like...

13:09.963 --> 13:13.009
A skyline.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.185
Carrie: If we line up
the holes with
the Gotham skyline,

13:15.229 --> 13:17.013
then maybe we'll find
the location of the Electrum.

13:17.057 --> 13:20.451
Yeah, maybe, assuming
this map was created

13:20.495 --> 13:23.715
in this exact belfry,
peering out of that
exact window,

13:23.759 --> 13:26.153
and we teleported
back in time 100 years

13:26.196 --> 13:27.981
to look out
at Gotham's
old skyline.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.200
Cullen: Oh, my God. Ha!

13:30.244 --> 13:31.549
You're brilliant!
Duela: Really?

13:31.593 --> 13:33.073
Because I just
pitched time travel.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.639
Yeah. Not you. Carrie.

13:34.683 --> 13:35.684
Can I borrow your laptop
real quick?

13:35.727 --> 13:38.295
Stephanie: Sure.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.602
Cullen: OK. So
when the Court stole Alan
Wayne's art collection,

13:40.645 --> 13:42.647
they took a very famous
painting of the old
Gotham skyline.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.562
Now what if...

13:44.606 --> 13:47.783
Alan Wayne designed
this map

13:47.827 --> 13:48.958
with that painting?

13:52.353 --> 13:53.484
Ohh!

13:57.227 --> 13:58.707
You're right.
I am brilliant.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.361
Cullen: Ha!

14:00.404 --> 14:02.363
Stephanie: So, Harper,
what are the chances

14:02.406 --> 14:03.755
that the Electrum is hidden

14:03.799 --> 14:05.845
directly underneath
that building?

14:05.888 --> 14:07.803
All things considered...

14:07.847 --> 14:09.413
I'd say 100%.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.601
Ohh!

14:23.645 --> 14:26.256
You've grown up
so much.

14:26.300 --> 14:30.347
Look at you.
Practically a grown man.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.567
We are so proud
of you, Turner.

14:37.485 --> 14:40.444
You're not real.

14:40.488 --> 14:42.969
This isn't really happening.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.622
It's whatever Lincoln
put on the knife.

14:44.665 --> 14:46.276
It's messing with me.
Mr. Hayes: No, no, no.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.061
Hey, Turn.
Look at me, look at me.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.846
We are real to you
right now.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.590
I want you to be.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.853
You have no idea
how much.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.248
I know.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.250
I know.

15:03.293 --> 15:06.427
Hey. We know everything
that you've been through.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.907
Turner, we love you.

15:09.691 --> 15:10.910
I love you, too.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.089
I missed you so much.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.091
The day you died,
my whole world

15:18.134 --> 15:19.831
got ripped out
from under me.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.050
Of course it did.

15:25.794 --> 15:29.624
But Bruce gave you
a whole new world,

15:29.667 --> 15:33.802
gave you...everything
we never could.

15:33.845 --> 15:36.544
He gave me a lot of things.
He could never bring you back.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.154
That's not what I meant.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.678
But he helped you
forget about us,

15:40.722 --> 15:43.812
helped you move on.

15:43.855 --> 15:46.467
I never moved on, Mom.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.991
I think what your
mother's getting at is

15:49.035 --> 15:53.604
if you were so deeply
affected by our deaths,

15:53.648 --> 15:56.607
then why didn't you
look a little harder
for our killer?

16:08.184 --> 16:10.534
[Cell phone vibrating]

16:14.147 --> 16:16.323
Dent.
Man: Mr. Dent...

16:16.366 --> 16:19.282
I have those results
from the samples
you sent over.

16:19.326 --> 16:20.544
And?

16:20.588 --> 16:21.937
Got a positive match

16:21.981 --> 16:23.983
for Cressida Clarke.

16:26.463 --> 16:27.987
How would you like
this filed?

16:30.598 --> 16:34.515
Sir? Hello?

16:34.558 --> 16:37.083
File it as additional
evidence found at the scene.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.214
Thanks.

16:49.617 --> 16:54.665
If you're watching this,
it means that I'm behind bars

16:54.709 --> 16:57.146
for the murders of Mayor Hill
and Cressida Clarke,

16:57.190 --> 16:59.148
and there's a good chance
you can also prove

16:59.192 --> 17:02.978
that I have been framing
Turner Hayes for these crimes.

17:05.023 --> 17:08.201
As district attorney,

17:08.243 --> 17:11.900
my cases live and die
based on evidence,

17:11.943 --> 17:14.381
and I will be the first
to admit that the evidence

17:14.424 --> 17:16.035
against me is
pretty damn convincing...

17:18.472 --> 17:24.434
but I'm recording this
to tell you that it is
unequivocally wrong.

17:24.478 --> 17:27.046
I'm innocent,

17:27.089 --> 17:29.874
and the Harvey Dent
that you know

17:29.918 --> 17:31.267
is not a murderer.

17:33.182 --> 17:35.837
[Wheels screeching]

17:40.929 --> 17:43.236
So assuming we read
Alan Wayne's map correctly,

17:43.279 --> 17:46.152
the Electrum
should be close.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.371
Carrie, on comms: Anyone else
creeped out by these tunnels?

17:48.415 --> 17:49.894
They just feel so--
Duela: Moist?

17:49.938 --> 17:51.896
I was gonna say
claustrophobic.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.637
You know, we're
actually pretty close
to the sewer

17:53.681 --> 17:55.726
where Alan Wayne's
body was found.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.859
Duela: OK. So maybe
he didn't die falling
down a sewer.

17:57.902 --> 18:00.122
Maybe he died tripping balls
on Talon drugs,

18:00.166 --> 18:03.299
looking for the Electrum
he hid in a desperate attempt
to save his life.

18:03.343 --> 18:04.996
Stephanie: Guys, might
have found something.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.737
[Freek beeping]

18:14.789 --> 18:16.747
[Sighing] Granite.
Likely the ground mineral

18:16.791 --> 18:19.359
present when they dug
the tunnels back
in the day.

18:19.402 --> 18:20.751
Damn it.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.755
So how is that thing
supposed to detect an alloy

18:24.799 --> 18:27.671
that's so rare it may not
even exist on planet Earth?

18:27.715 --> 18:30.500
It can't, but it can
filter out the frequencies

18:30.544 --> 18:32.546
of known alloys.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.678
We just got to find
the odd one out.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.637
I'm sure Turner would take
comfort in knowing

18:36.680 --> 18:40.031
his life hangs in the balance
of a homemade rock detector.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.946
Freek may not be
Bat-tech,

18:41.990 --> 18:45.211
but if Electrum's
here, she'll find it,

18:45.254 --> 18:46.821
and we'll have Turner
back before prom.

18:46.864 --> 18:49.650
Ha! Turner is many things,
but my prom date

18:49.693 --> 18:52.218
is not one of them.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.524
Fine. Your friendship
will continue to
reap its benefits.

18:54.568 --> 18:57.745
Turner is like
a brother to me,

18:57.788 --> 18:59.660
but I appreciate
your interest
in my sex life.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.140
May I?

19:12.586 --> 19:13.935
[Beep beep]

19:15.545 --> 19:18.287
That's good, right?

19:18.331 --> 19:20.507
[Tapping]

19:20.550 --> 19:21.856
Let's find out.

19:23.553 --> 19:24.467
Move.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.081
[Grunting]

20:01.025 --> 20:03.202
Houston, we have
Electrum.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.819
-I thought it'd be bigger.
-Same.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.603
Harper: Me, too.
Carrie: Agreed.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.170
Stephanie: OK. It offers
humans immortality.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.041
Maybe cut it some slack.

20:17.085 --> 20:18.869
Duela: Well, if the Court
thinks one little rock

20:18.913 --> 20:21.829
is worth a century of murder
and mustache twirling,

20:21.872 --> 20:24.223
just think of what
two little rocks
might be worth.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.486
Cullen: Um, Duela, uh--OK.

20:26.529 --> 20:27.704
[Grunting]

20:27.748 --> 20:29.445
Damn it!

20:29.489 --> 20:31.055
That was my favorite knife!

20:31.099 --> 20:33.449
You're lucky we need you,
you stupid rock!

20:33.493 --> 20:35.408
Or--or what? You'd
break another knife
trying to kill it?

20:35.451 --> 20:37.410
It's indestructible.
That's the whole point.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.803
It lives forever.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.283
Stephanie: I guess if
I led an ancient
secret society,

20:41.327 --> 20:42.415
I'd want the Talon
protecting me to be

20:42.458 --> 20:43.938
impervious
to death, too.

20:43.981 --> 20:46.332
Asterisk, decapitation
not included.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.029
Or you could use
the alloy to save
actual sick people.

20:48.072 --> 20:50.379
If doctors
and scientists
could study this,

20:50.423 --> 20:52.251
it could revolutionize
modern medicine.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.209
Well, for now, it's
just gonna sit here
collecting dust

20:54.253 --> 20:55.863
until we can actually
figure out a way
to find Turner.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.168
[Sighs]

21:00.650 --> 21:01.956
I think I know
how to do that.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.701
Harper: It should just
be a simple triangulation
of radio waves.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.311
Mmm. That can be
a little imprecise,

21:09.355 --> 21:11.444
but we could try
a true range
multilateration.

21:11.487 --> 21:13.707
Nice. Gets us
even more specific.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.623
Once I can identify
the exact frequency
on this radio--

21:16.666 --> 21:18.755
I can run it through
my program to pinpoint
the coordinates.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.583
Duela: OK. Is this something
we need to understand,

21:20.627 --> 21:23.107
or can we skip
to the "aha" moment?

21:23.151 --> 21:24.718
Since we know the Court
controls the construction crew

21:24.761 --> 21:26.720
and we know how important
that little rock is

21:26.763 --> 21:28.461
-to their very existence--
-They'd want minute-to-minute

21:28.504 --> 21:29.984
updates on
their progress.

21:30.027 --> 21:31.028
So they're listening
to the radio?

21:31.072 --> 21:32.465
Duela: Thank you.

21:32.508 --> 21:34.031
If I can isolate
the incoming

21:34.075 --> 21:35.468
and outgoing
frequency signals...

21:35.511 --> 21:37.165
[Beeping]

21:37.208 --> 21:38.862
[Radio signal]

21:38.906 --> 21:40.864
Then I can triangulate
them to a nearby

21:40.908 --> 21:42.866
ground-based detection
facility, which should

21:42.910 --> 21:45.695
geolocate the Court's
latitude and longitude,

21:45.739 --> 21:46.870
which could lead us
to Turner.

21:46.914 --> 21:49.351
-In theory.
-In theory.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.310
Does Electrum
heal grudges?
Because it just did.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.921
Tell me about it!
If Sharper played
this nice from the jump,

21:53.964 --> 21:55.575
we would have cleared
our names months ago.

21:55.618 --> 21:58.229
-Sorry. Sharper?
-What? Harphanie?

21:58.273 --> 22:01.102
[Computer chimes]

22:01.145 --> 22:02.973
Got a lock on the signal.
Cullen: Yes.

22:06.934 --> 22:08.675
[Pinging]

22:08.718 --> 22:10.198
Wait. That can't be right.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.852
Why would they
take him there?

22:11.895 --> 22:13.549
Actually, that makes
perfect sense.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.159
Cullen: OK. All right.
So we got the spot.

22:15.203 --> 22:16.726
What do we do
when we get there?

22:16.770 --> 22:18.075
Hopefully something
that doesn't involve

22:18.119 --> 22:19.642
giving a bioweapon
to a murderous cabal.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.035
Yeah. That makes sense. OK.

22:21.078 --> 22:23.124
Uh, Duela--

22:23.167 --> 22:24.691
where's Duela?

22:24.734 --> 22:26.997
Harper:
Uh, where's the Electrum?

22:27.041 --> 22:28.608
[Door shuts]

22:32.176 --> 22:35.179
Carrie: Duela!
Duela, stop! Hey!

22:35.223 --> 22:36.833
You really don't want to
touch me right now.

22:36.877 --> 22:39.270
-What are you doing?
-I'm doing exactly

22:39.314 --> 22:40.533
what you should be
doing!

22:40.576 --> 22:42.143
I am saving Turner.

22:42.186 --> 22:44.537
Carrie: Get off me.
Duela: Unh!

22:44.580 --> 22:46.626
You can't just give
that to the most dangerous
people in Gotham!

22:46.669 --> 22:50.369
The most dangerous
people in Gotham
have your friend!

22:50.412 --> 22:52.893
Or do you prefer
to abandon him
all over again?

22:52.936 --> 22:55.374
We will find a way
to save Turner
but not like this,

22:55.417 --> 22:57.071
not when we could use
that Electrum for good.

22:57.114 --> 23:00.030
Good? Heh.
Have you met me?

23:00.074 --> 23:02.555
Yes, I've met you.
I've met so many people

23:02.598 --> 23:04.731
just like you,
people who grew up
without a glimmer of hope,

23:04.774 --> 23:07.037
and you didn't deserve that,
and neither do they,

23:07.081 --> 23:08.822
but what if this rock
could help change that
for everyone?

23:08.865 --> 23:12.216
I don't care about everyone!
I care about Turner.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.609
Cullen: What if we could
do both?

23:15.959 --> 23:17.352
Look. I think I have
a way to save Turner

23:17.396 --> 23:18.701
and protect Gotham
at the same time.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.107
Pick a rock, any rock.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.243
Duela: Which is which?
Carrie: If you have to ask,

23:39.287 --> 23:41.202
that means
Cullen killed it.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.596
Duela: Ha!
Cullen: This one's the fake one,

23:43.639 --> 23:45.424
and this should
help sell it.

23:53.257 --> 23:56.130
Harper: OK. Team field trip.
I've got comms,

23:56.173 --> 23:57.653
Carrie's got the perimeter,

23:57.697 --> 23:59.176
Stephanie will be
our command center here,

23:59.220 --> 24:01.004
and getaway car is
idling downstairs.

24:01.048 --> 24:05.008
Duela: Well...
let's go make a deal.

24:05.052 --> 24:06.009
Ha ha!

24:07.402 --> 24:09.404
You're in a good mood.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.885
-Is that so weird?
-Well, I just painted a lump

24:11.928 --> 24:14.540
of kiln-fired clay
to pass off
as a meteorite

24:14.583 --> 24:16.063
so we can save
our friend
from a bunch

24:16.106 --> 24:17.368
of murderous
bird worshippers,

24:17.412 --> 24:19.066
so...define weird.

24:19.109 --> 24:21.372
I am just happy
we finally have a plan.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.244
-Sue me.
-And this little burst of happy

24:23.287 --> 24:24.637
wouldn't have
anything to do
with a little

24:24.680 --> 24:26.029
blue-eyed blonde,
would it?

24:26.073 --> 24:28.945
-Huh. Who? Stephanie?
-No. Vicki Vale.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.338
Yes. Stephanie.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.211
Stephanie is not a factor.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.387
-But she is your type.
-My type?

24:36.431 --> 24:38.607
Well, you know,
one of two, actually.

24:38.651 --> 24:41.480
You only ever
fall for himbos
or straight girls,

24:41.523 --> 24:43.482
people you don't
take seriously

24:43.525 --> 24:44.613
and people who won't
love you back.

24:46.746 --> 24:49.879
Ha! Oh, my God!
I am not falling
for anyone, OK?

24:49.923 --> 24:51.968
-Stephanie and I are friends.
-OK.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.666
And I'm sorry.
Weren't you the one

24:53.709 --> 24:55.058
who told me to give
her a chance?

24:57.452 --> 24:58.497
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.457
Sue me.

25:12.423 --> 25:15.688
Mrs. Hayes: Did you
even try to find out
who murdered us?

25:15.731 --> 25:17.864
How can you ask me that?

25:17.907 --> 25:20.083
Mr. Hayes: You never bothered
to find out what happened

25:20.127 --> 25:22.129
or why.

25:22.172 --> 25:24.131
It's like you never
even noticed we were gone.

25:24.174 --> 25:27.438
Noticed? I was destroyed.

25:27.482 --> 25:29.223
I was just a kid
when you died.

25:29.266 --> 25:31.530
If--if I could have
brought you justice,
I would have.

25:31.573 --> 25:35.142
But he could have--
Bruce Wayne, Batman.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.666
Mrs. Hayes: The world's
greatest detective.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.276
Why didn't he?

25:39.320 --> 25:41.278
Why didn't he catch
our killer?

25:41.322 --> 25:43.716
That was years ago.
I'm sure he tried.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.456
I--I mean, I know he--
I know he did.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.328
He tried?

25:47.371 --> 25:50.853
The man had
every resource
at his disposal.

25:50.897 --> 25:54.857
Batman has given justice
to so many people.

25:54.901 --> 25:57.947
Why not his own
adopted son?

25:57.991 --> 25:59.470
He should have
stopped at nothing

25:59.514 --> 26:01.342
to find our killer.

26:01.385 --> 26:04.084
Just like you've stopped
at nothing to find his

26:04.127 --> 26:07.740
because you didn't
murder Batman.

26:07.783 --> 26:09.785
[Distorted] Why didn't he?

26:09.829 --> 26:11.178
Why didn't he
catch our killer?

26:11.221 --> 26:12.962
-Why didn't he?
-Why didn't he?

26:13.006 --> 26:14.398
Mr. Hayes: Why?
Turner: I don't know.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.618
Why didn't he?
Mr. Hayes: Why didn't he?

26:16.662 --> 26:18.402
Mr. Hayes: Why didn't he?
Man: Why didn't he?

26:18.446 --> 26:19.447
Lincoln: Why didn't he?
Woman: Why didn't he?!

26:19.490 --> 26:21.318
Why didn't he?

26:21.362 --> 26:24.234
Lincoln: Why didn't he?

26:24.278 --> 26:26.454
Why didn't he?

26:26.497 --> 26:28.848
Why didn't he?

26:28.891 --> 26:30.632
Turner:
I know this isn't real.

26:30.676 --> 26:33.330
[Reverberating]

26:33.374 --> 26:36.029
Lincoln: Why didn't he?

26:36.072 --> 26:37.030
Why didn't he?

26:38.727 --> 26:39.859
Why didn't he?

26:42.426 --> 26:43.602
Why didn't he?

26:46.953 --> 26:50.086
It's been you
the whole time.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.697
What do you want
from me?

26:51.740 --> 26:53.568
The answer
to the question.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.831
You were raised by the world's
greatest detective.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.790
Surely, you can figure out
why he never brought

26:57.833 --> 27:00.270
your parents' murderer
to justice.

27:00.314 --> 27:02.185
You could have asked
him yourself if you
didn't have him killed.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.361
But would he have given
me the truth?

27:04.405 --> 27:06.973
A truth he denied
his own son,

27:07.016 --> 27:10.237
a truth that you know
deep down in your bones.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.630
Think about it, Turner.
10 years ago,

27:11.673 --> 27:14.241
your parents,
average Gotham citizens,

27:14.284 --> 27:17.026
suddenly die,
leaving behind a child.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.550
It happens every day,

27:19.594 --> 27:21.988
but on this particular day,

27:22.031 --> 27:24.381
the richest man in the city
shows up at their funeral

27:24.425 --> 27:27.080
and decides he wants to adopt
their little boy?

27:29.865 --> 27:31.650
Didn't you ever wonder why?

27:33.652 --> 27:36.655
Of all the hundreds
of innocent, needy,

27:36.698 --> 27:39.527
desperate little orphans
living in this city's filth,

27:39.570 --> 27:42.356
Bruce Wayne chose you.

27:45.794 --> 27:48.101
You're trying to
manipulate me.

27:48.144 --> 27:49.972
You planted all this
in my head so I'd join

27:50.016 --> 27:51.495
your twisted cult.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.802
This isn't
mind control, Turner.

27:53.846 --> 27:55.717
I've only
offered suggestions,

27:55.761 --> 27:58.024
asked the necessary questions.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.983
Your subconscious brought
those to life as it saw fit,

28:01.027 --> 28:03.246
but you must admit...

28:03.290 --> 28:05.509
so many things
about your life

28:05.553 --> 28:07.381
suddenly make sense
now, don't they?

28:07.424 --> 28:09.426
Turner: Go to hell.
Lincoln: We all know that Bruce

28:09.470 --> 28:11.037
could never move on
from his own parents' murder.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.865
Why did he press you
to move on from yours?

28:12.908 --> 28:14.214
You don't know him.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.129
But you do. Deep down,

28:16.172 --> 28:18.305
you know this wasn't
luck or fate

28:18.348 --> 28:20.176
or some winning
lottery ticket.

28:20.220 --> 28:23.484
This wasn't compassion
or charity or love.

28:23.527 --> 28:24.964
No. No!

28:25.007 --> 28:26.182
This was guilt, Turner.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.751
-No.
-He gave you everything

28:29.795 --> 28:32.972
because he'd already taken
everything from you.

28:35.365 --> 28:38.238
You know the truth.
Now say it out loud.

28:38.281 --> 28:40.893
Tell me.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.721
Why did you become
an orphan?

28:48.857 --> 28:50.859
Because Batman
made me one.

28:55.777 --> 28:57.300
Lincoln: Realizing that
everything you thought you knew

28:57.344 --> 28:59.302
about your father was a lie,
that his legacy

28:59.346 --> 29:01.435
that you've worked so hard
to live up to

29:01.478 --> 29:04.612
was one of deceit
and betrayal.

29:04.655 --> 29:06.745
I cannot begin to imagine
how you're feeling right now.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.836
You spent most of your life
trying to prove

29:10.879 --> 29:12.489
that you were worthy of him,

29:12.533 --> 29:14.753
but I hope you see

29:14.796 --> 29:16.276
he was never worthy of you.

29:18.104 --> 29:20.367
But there is freedom
in that,

29:20.410 --> 29:23.109
freedom to create
your own legacy.

29:23.152 --> 29:25.415
You want to show me
freedom? Untie me.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.766
Oh, I would never win
that fight, not against you.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.507
You're too strong,
too driven. Hmm.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.640
You have potential
that my own son

29:32.683 --> 29:34.598
threw out the window.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.383
Maybe it's the orphan
in you,

29:36.426 --> 29:41.127
that fire to fight
for what you believe in,

29:41.170 --> 29:44.130
even if it means
killing for it.

29:44.173 --> 29:46.306
Tell me...

29:46.349 --> 29:49.483
how did it feel
to kill the Talon?

29:49.526 --> 29:51.746
Good?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.835
Exhilarating,
righteous?

29:53.879 --> 29:56.055
You did not hesitate.
You did not falter,

29:56.098 --> 29:57.926
and with one bold stroke,

29:57.970 --> 29:59.710
you killed the man
who killed your father.

29:59.754 --> 30:03.018
You avenged him,
and in that moment,

30:03.062 --> 30:06.979
you did something
even Batman couldn't do.

30:07.022 --> 30:09.590
How did it feel
to be more powerful

30:09.633 --> 30:13.202
than even your father,
the Dark Knight?

30:13.246 --> 30:15.422
You don't owe him
anything anymore, Turner.

30:15.465 --> 30:18.773
He betrayed you,
he denied your parents justice.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.819
He denied you justice.

30:23.691 --> 30:27.869
So why not become the one
who delivers it?

30:27.913 --> 30:28.827
Join us.

30:30.741 --> 30:31.873
Join us.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.879

glass shatters]

30:43.972 --> 30:44.973
Ugh!

30:47.846 --> 30:49.804
Cullen: OK. All clear.
Duela: We're in.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.023
Carrie, on comms: And I'll be
here to make sure

30:51.066 --> 30:52.894
you have a way out.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.374
Duela: You and those
fancy Bat-glasses got

30:54.417 --> 30:56.071
a 20 on our boy yet?

30:56.115 --> 30:58.682
Carrie: Main room
ahead and to the left.

30:58.726 --> 31:00.293

multiple heat signatures.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.034
Heh. Ha ha ha!

31:02.077 --> 31:04.601
Oh, I'll be the one
bringing the heat.

31:04.645 --> 31:06.386
[Turner grunts]

31:06.429 --> 31:08.388
You're delusional
if you think

31:08.431 --> 31:10.433
I'm ever gonna become
your serial killer mascot.

31:10.477 --> 31:12.087
It's not about killing,
Turner.

31:12.131 --> 31:13.654
It's about fighting
for the Gotham

31:13.697 --> 31:15.264
that you want to see.

31:15.308 --> 31:16.875
That's a hell of a way
to describe

31:16.918 --> 31:18.441
taking out everyone
that gets in your way.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.269
Lincoln: No one's
above death, not even Batman,

31:20.313 --> 31:23.403
but the Talon--the Talon
isn't just anyone.

31:23.446 --> 31:24.970
The Talon is dead.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.494
One Talon is dead, yes.

31:27.537 --> 31:30.192
He wasn't the first,
and he won't be the last.

What do you know? Ha!

31:57.567 --> 32:00.048
One moment. I--I
figured this would be formal,

32:00.092 --> 32:02.616
so I dressed
for the occasion.

32:14.106 --> 32:16.456
Aw. Anything Daddy could do
I can do better.

for Turner's life.

33:01.327 --> 33:04.156
Now, if that is
really Electrum,

33:04.199 --> 33:05.809
it should heal him

had a plan B.

Unh!

33:53.988 --> 33:56.034
[Breathing heavily]

33:59.559 --> 34:01.169
I held up my end
of the bargain.

Turner, my offer
still stands.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.284
I'm OK. I'm OK.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.364
Does it hurt?

Nope. Neither
does my neck.

I'm just happy
to be here with you.

Can we do two minutes
on Brody's dad

35:22.729 --> 35:24.470
being the head
of the Court?

35:24.513 --> 35:26.080
I mean, I knew that
he was a dick,

35:26.124 --> 35:28.126
but I didn't think that
he was straight-up evil.

35:30.824 --> 35:33.261
What...did he do
to you?

35:35.481 --> 35:38.788

That's what matters.

of these...weirdos.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.147
You know you can talk
to me, right?

35:51.279 --> 35:52.802
No matter what it is.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.156
Whenever you're ready.

36:16.739 --> 36:19.655
You made the right choice
tonight, you know.

36:19.699 --> 36:21.918
You trying to convince
me or you?

36:21.962 --> 36:24.356
Cullen: Oh,
I'm sure of it.

36:24.399 --> 36:27.185
There's a few people
down there who'd agree.

36:27.228 --> 36:29.796
You knew there was
a good chance the Court
would call our bluff.

36:29.839 --> 36:32.146
You didn't even want to
give up the Electrum,

36:32.190 --> 36:34.322
but you knew it was
a better option than
Duela's bomber jacket.

36:34.366 --> 36:37.325
We had to have a plan B
that wouldn't end up
with all of us dead.

36:40.110 --> 36:42.287
But giving the bad guys
the means to live forever,

36:42.330 --> 36:44.898
it's not exactly out
of the Bat-manual.

36:44.941 --> 36:47.466
No...

36:47.509 --> 36:48.684
[Sighs]

36:51.165 --> 36:52.775
but it could be
the first chapter

36:52.819 --> 36:54.212
in the "Book of Robin."

36:56.170 --> 36:58.955
You got to give yourself
a break, Carrie.

36:58.999 --> 37:01.349
You saved Turner tonight.

37:01.393 --> 37:04.134
He's alive
because of you.

37:04.178 --> 37:07.660
I always wanted
to be a hero.

37:07.703 --> 37:11.751
Ever since I--I first
saw the Bat-signal
light up the sky.

37:11.794 --> 37:13.927
I just--I didn't
know it would mean

37:13.970 --> 37:15.537
having to choose
which lives to save

37:15.581 --> 37:17.147
and which to sacrifice,

37:17.191 --> 37:18.845
so I might have
saved Turner,

37:18.888 --> 37:20.238
but I just can't help
but wonder at what cost?

37:22.675 --> 37:24.111
I don't know.

37:26.896 --> 37:28.724
But one thing I do know
for sure...

37:31.466 --> 37:33.555
we're gonna keep
showing up,

37:33.599 --> 37:36.428
keep fighting.

37:36.471 --> 37:39.169
Because Gotham's worth
fighting for.

37:39.213 --> 37:42.434
You are what's keeping
Batman's legacy alive.

37:42.477 --> 37:45.132
You may not see it,
but I do.

37:45.175 --> 37:47.917
You know...bats
are considered

37:47.961 --> 37:52.270
some of the most
indomitable hunters
in nature,

37:52.313 --> 37:54.272
and they only have
one true natural predator.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.363
Owls.

37:58.406 --> 38:00.190
Bien: âª We didn't âª

38:00.234 --> 38:02.280
And we just made them
even more dangerous.

38:05.326 --> 38:11.941
Bien:
âª We didn't want it to end âª

38:11.985 --> 38:17.207
âª We know that we'll be
the heroes âª

38:17.251 --> 38:18.818
âª Even though... âª

38:18.861 --> 38:21.908
Turner: Need a hand?

38:21.951 --> 38:25.433
Heh. Depends if I
blow off one of mine.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.524
Actually, you got
some delicate fingers?

38:29.568 --> 38:34.877
'Cuz...one wrong tug,
and...kablooey.

38:34.921 --> 38:38.228
Bien: âª Seconds frozen âª

38:38.272 --> 38:40.927
âª When we're surrounded
on all sides âª

38:40.970 --> 38:42.624
Ever think you'd be
helping a girl

38:42.668 --> 38:44.147
untangle
her explosives,

38:44.191 --> 38:47.281
or do I have
the pleasure
of being your first?

38:47.325 --> 38:49.631
My life has gotten
a lot more surprising
since I met you.

38:49.675 --> 38:50.893
I'll give you that.

38:53.026 --> 38:55.158
Bien: âª Everything's moving
in slow motion âª

38:55.202 --> 38:57.987
Ohh!

38:58.031 --> 38:59.206
Thank you.

38:59.249 --> 39:00.338
Here.

39:04.516 --> 39:09.085
Thank you...
for all of this.

39:09.129 --> 39:11.784
Even though I'm sure
you had some secret
Duelian agenda.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.655
Heh.

39:13.699 --> 39:16.441
Um...I'm glad saving
my life was part of that.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.486
No agenda this time.
Just you.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.929
[Gagging]

39:26.973 --> 39:29.715
Turner? Hey. Turner,
what's wrong?

39:29.758 --> 39:31.325
Turner, Turner!

39:31.369 --> 39:33.109
[Vomits]

39:33.153 --> 39:34.589
Turner, talk to me,
talk to me. Turner!

39:34.633 --> 39:37.244
Somebody, help!
Somebody, help!

39:37.287 --> 39:39.681
Turner?

39:39.725 --> 39:42.118
Harvey: I know how damning
all this looks--

39:42.162 --> 39:44.425
the key to the mayor's limo,
the Owl mask,

39:44.469 --> 39:46.296
Cressida Clarke's blood.

39:46.340 --> 39:49.909
All of this suggests
that I was

39:49.952 --> 39:52.085
physically at the scenes
of the crimes,

39:52.128 --> 39:54.217
if not perpetrating them,

39:54.261 --> 39:58.178
but...while my body
may have been present,

39:58.221 --> 39:59.962
my mind was not.

40:00.006 --> 40:01.790
I have been...

40:01.834 --> 40:03.270
I have been experiencing
something,

40:03.313 --> 40:04.837
and I can't explain.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.535
I'm--I'm having blackouts
and losing time.

40:07.579 --> 40:09.972
I'm waking up in places
that I...

40:10.016 --> 40:12.627
I don't remember going to.

40:12.671 --> 40:14.847
Whatever is happening
during those periods,

40:14.890 --> 40:19.678
and whoever that is,
whatever that person is doing,

40:19.721 --> 40:22.071
it's not me,

40:22.115 --> 40:25.423
and I will not...go down

40:25.466 --> 40:27.120
for someone else's crimes.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.644
[Camera beeping]

40:47.401 --> 40:49.534
Hiya, Harv.

40:49.577 --> 40:54.974
It's me...you, the other you.

40:55.017 --> 40:57.367
Looks like I know you
pretty well after all, huh?

40:57.411 --> 40:59.369
Look at you--

40:59.413 --> 41:02.068
crafting a video defense.

41:02.111 --> 41:04.157
Very clever.
That's what I would do.

41:04.200 --> 41:07.073
Well, hell, I am doing it,

41:07.116 --> 41:09.989
but you're watching this...

41:10.032 --> 41:13.906
and that means...
you think you're a killer...

41:16.125 --> 41:17.475
and let me assure you...

41:20.521 --> 41:23.263
you're no killer, Harvey Dent.

41:25.221 --> 41:28.137
[Sirens]

41:51.073 --> 41:52.510
Man: Greg, move your head.
