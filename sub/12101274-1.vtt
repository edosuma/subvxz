WEBVTT

01:00.718 --> 01:03.254
<i>This is Haraway,</i>

01:03.286 --> 01:07.924
<i>a grand city of invention,
prosperity, and peace.</i>

01:07.957 --> 01:10.828
<i>The people of Haraway are
creative and industrious,</i>

01:11.762 --> 01:13.965
<i>excited about the
advancement of science</i>

01:13.998 --> 01:16.466
<i>to better their lives and
the lives of their families.</i>

01:47.730 --> 01:53.737
And now, I present to you,
the first being ever created by grafting.

01:53.771 --> 01:57.340
Actually grown from parts
of plants and animals.

01:57.373 --> 02:02.445
A completely new person,
with two hearts!

02:04.847 --> 02:07.784
These two hearts allow
this unique creature

02:07.817 --> 02:11.588
twice the energy,
and twice the power.

02:17.093 --> 02:20.397
Well, not bad for someone who spends
his time gluing fish together.

02:20.431 --> 02:23.801
Hmm. Well, let's see you do
better with your nuts and bolts.

02:23.834 --> 02:26.871
Unlike my esteemed
competitor here,

02:26.903 --> 02:30.441
my new invention doesn't need
a diaper change to amaze you.

02:32.742 --> 02:36.646
And now, made entirely
with techno-science,

02:36.680 --> 02:39.884
the first ever mechanical man,
complete with

02:39.917 --> 02:41.519
a thinking brain.

02:44.822 --> 02:49.659
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present the future of all science,

02:49.693 --> 02:51.829
T-Bolt.

02:53.963 --> 02:54.998
Don't be alarmed.

02:55.032 --> 02:57.935
He's actually
quite domesticated.

02:57.967 --> 02:59.836
T-Bolt, sweep the floor.

03:00.903 --> 03:03.873
Now, polish my boots.

03:03.907 --> 03:05.977
Now it's time for you
to get some exercise.

03:06.310 --> 03:07.812
T-Bolt,

03:07.844 --> 03:08.945
skip rope.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.893
Security! Over here!

03:22.992 --> 03:25.429
Hmm.

03:25.461 --> 03:30.066
Everything's under control.
I assure you, he is completely harmless.

03:42.079 --> 03:43.781
I'm sorry I had to
do that, Tinkerer.

03:44.615 --> 03:45.983
I hope he's not damaged.

03:46.015 --> 03:47.852
I think it was damaged
to begin with.

03:47.884 --> 03:50.554
So I assume there's further work to be done?

03:50.586 --> 03:51.855
And where would you
like him delivered?

03:51.889 --> 03:53.924
You take it. Do
whatever you want.

03:53.956 --> 03:55.725
I don't ever want
to see him again.

03:56.826 --> 03:57.895
As you wish, sir.

03:58.127 --> 03:59.396
Hmm.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.069
Oh!

04:19.783 --> 04:21.951
<i>As long as
anyone could remember,</i>

04:21.985 --> 04:24.622
<i>the town had been watched
over by the Ancients,</i>

04:24.654 --> 04:26.524
<i>as the people called them.</i>

04:26.557 --> 04:30.961
<i>Arbiters of justice, symbols
of stability and reason.</i>

04:30.994 --> 04:33.831
<i>All anyone had to do was
look up and they were there.</i>

04:35.699 --> 04:37.468
<i>They kept everyone safe.</i>

04:38.468 --> 04:39.937
<i>That is, until the Blight.</i>

04:42.038 --> 04:43.940
<i>The Blight,</i>

04:43.973 --> 04:46.711
<i>an invisible plague
that rolled over the world,</i>

04:47.877 --> 04:51.048
<i>bringing sickness
and great loss.</i>

04:51.081 --> 04:54.519
<i>It came and went without warning and
people were affected in different ways.</i>

04:55.519 --> 04:56.887
<i>Some got sick,</i>

04:56.920 --> 04:58.855
<i>some lost
the use of their limbs,</i>

04:58.889 --> 05:00.458
<i>and some even died.</i>

05:02.725 --> 05:04.829
<i>The people were divided.</i>

05:04.862 --> 05:07.899
Followers of the Tinkerer
became Technocrats.

05:11.134 --> 05:14.439
<i>Those who followed the Grafter
dubbed themselves Biotists.</i>

05:18.908 --> 05:20.911
<i>One city became two,</i>

05:20.944 --> 05:23.146
<i>and the Blight
continued to spread.</i>

05:23.180 --> 05:24.449
Mmm.

06:33.016 --> 06:37.620
Girl, come here this instant and
ready your miraculous brain for knowledge.

06:37.653 --> 06:39.557
We will begin with...

06:39.589 --> 06:41.791
"Girl." That's what
you are.

06:41.824 --> 06:43.593
And "genius."

06:44.661 --> 06:45.995
That's what I am.

06:46.028 --> 06:48.832
I'm certified, somewhere.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.735
Thinking, the first
tool of invention.

07:06.949 --> 07:09.353
Oh! Nature is
an infection!

07:09.386 --> 07:12.223
You need to focus on machines.

07:17.124 --> 07:18.094
But I am focusing
on machines.

07:18.127 --> 07:19.663
Look what I made.

07:45.788 --> 07:47.858
Get back here you...

07:54.331 --> 07:55.366
Master Huxley,

07:55.399 --> 07:57.067
we have to get you ready.

07:58.235 --> 08:01.071
No, Master Huxley.
Stop!

08:01.103 --> 08:03.373
Archibald, hold that boy!

08:10.980 --> 08:12.281
Come here!

08:12.314 --> 08:13.684
Ow!

08:13.716 --> 08:15.685
Huxley!
Where have you been?

08:15.718 --> 08:16.754
Hey, Dad.

08:16.786 --> 08:18.921
I am sorry, sir.

08:18.954 --> 08:20.757
He's not dressed.

08:20.790 --> 08:22.259
I'm not wearing
your monkey suit!

08:22.291 --> 08:24.727
Admiral Wells is gonna
be here any minute now.

08:24.761 --> 08:26.830
Why do we let her push
us around?

08:26.862 --> 08:28.999
- We don't have to take that.
- No, no, no.

08:29.031 --> 08:30.433
We do, like it or not.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.802
The Ancient order put
Admiral Wells in charge.

08:32.836 --> 08:35.706
She does what they tell her
and we do what she tells us.

08:39.375 --> 08:41.379
- Nice airship.
- Quickly.

09:09.072 --> 09:11.875
Admiral Wells, an honor,
as always...

09:11.908 --> 09:13.744
Dendrus, the Grafter.

09:13.777 --> 09:18.382
Please, follow me. I have so much to show you.

09:27.758 --> 09:33.097
We've recently found new ways to aid the
Blight-ridden among us using transplantation.

09:33.129 --> 09:36.899
This man was blind until we
grafted a sea monster to his face.

09:36.932 --> 09:38.501
I can't blink.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.803
"See" monster, get I?

09:40.836 --> 09:42.173
"Sea"?

09:45.908 --> 09:48.245
Hilbert, show them
what you can do, Hilbert.

09:48.278 --> 09:49.279
Um... Uh...

09:52.282 --> 09:54.918
We've made marvelous
progress with our Marmakeets.

09:58.221 --> 10:01.859
They're proving very reliable
for predicting electrical storms.

10:05.261 --> 10:08.498
Grafter, the Ancient Order did not
send me here to tour a menagerie.

10:09.966 --> 10:11.368
Let me make this very clear.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.203
The Tinkerer designed
my army of Corvacks.

10:14.236 --> 10:16.105
The Tinkerer gave me T-Bolt.
You... HUXLEY: Hey!

10:16.139 --> 10:19.042
...created an infestation
of flying vermin.

10:19.075 --> 10:22.179
Do these creatures prevent
the effects of the Blight?

10:22.211 --> 10:23.813
Of course not, no.

10:23.846 --> 10:26.949
Does anything
here prevent the Blight?

10:26.982 --> 10:29.252
- Well, Huxley here.
- The monster boy?

10:29.285 --> 10:32.388
Huxley is special,
very special.

10:32.422 --> 10:34.925
Of course we know
the Blight is spreading.

10:34.957 --> 10:37.427
We've all felt its effects,
some more than others.

10:37.460 --> 10:39.797
But we're all sick,
Admiral Wells.

10:39.830 --> 10:41.465
Is there a point to this?

10:41.498 --> 10:46.103
Yes, yes. You see,
Huxley has never been sick.

10:46.135 --> 10:49.305
You cannot replicate
this immunity in others.

10:49.339 --> 10:51.175
But Huxley is proof

10:51.207 --> 10:53.843
that Biotist science,
with the proper support,

10:53.876 --> 10:55.478
will find an answer.

11:00.918 --> 11:02.887
A poorly
trained animal

11:03.854 --> 11:06.256
is no solution to the Blight.

11:06.288 --> 11:09.860
If you haven't found
a cure by the time I return,

11:09.893 --> 11:12.428
you'll face the tribunal
of the Ancients.

11:17.299 --> 11:21.070
Wrestling Marmakeets in front
of Admiral Wells?

11:21.104 --> 11:22.139
Barking?

11:22.172 --> 11:23.507
What barking?

11:23.539 --> 11:25.541
Everything that's
important to us could be shut down.

11:25.575 --> 11:26.877
Finished!

11:26.909 --> 11:30.279
And now that mad woman is
threatening to torture me, or worse.

11:30.312 --> 11:34.851
- Because of you.
- Dad, you heard her, she wouldn't even look at me.

11:34.884 --> 11:36.986
She thinks I'm a freak
like the rest of them.

11:37.019 --> 11:38.922
Then prove them wrong.

11:38.955 --> 11:41.490
You must promote
Biotist science, Huxley.

11:41.524 --> 11:42.926
You were made for this.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.327
I'm not a mascot.

12:40.082 --> 12:41.084
Oh!

12:46.022 --> 12:47.424
Hello.

12:47.456 --> 12:48.625
How are you today?

12:49.993 --> 12:51.595
Excuse me?

12:51.628 --> 12:53.530
- Hello?
- Oi, watch your step.

12:53.562 --> 12:55.097
The floor may be slippery.

12:55.130 --> 12:59.202
If you're damaged before tonight's
unveiling, the Tinkerer will have my head.

13:00.370 --> 13:03.373
What's that thing on your head?

13:03.405 --> 13:08.377
Oh, my earpiece. Yeah, the Tinkerer
made it for me when I lost my hearing.

13:08.410 --> 13:10.479
Why did you lose
your hearing?

13:10.513 --> 13:13.115
Oh, everyone lost something
when the Blight came.

13:13.149 --> 13:15.085
Now, have you been misplaced?

13:15.684 --> 13:16.920
Misplaced?

13:17.553 --> 13:18.721
Oh, I'm not lost.

13:18.754 --> 13:22.426
Please allow me to escort
you to the master's laboratory.

13:22.458 --> 13:23.626
Oh, it's fine.
I know the way.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.394
Thank you.

13:58.061 --> 13:59.262
Come along.

13:59.294 --> 14:01.264
We need to prepare
for tonight.

14:11.774 --> 14:15.211
Here we are,
easy now.

14:15.245 --> 14:18.514
- Will it hurt?
- No, no, not if you hold still.

14:18.548 --> 14:25.522
Let me see, just a small change in the alignment
for perfectly calibrated, articulation.

14:28.057 --> 14:29.625
- Too tight.
- That feels better.

14:30.225 --> 14:31.561
Perfect.

14:31.594 --> 14:35.232
Now let's check
your pupil dilation.

14:35.264 --> 14:38.034
- Father, I see very well already.
- Shh, quiet.

14:41.504 --> 14:43.807
Your eyes are amazing.

14:43.840 --> 14:47.677
- Thank you.
- They can see far outside the visible spectrum.

14:47.710 --> 14:52.416
With your eyes, I can make huge
advancements in technocrat science.

14:54.650 --> 14:58.021
Note to self,
research light spectrum on optics.

14:59.655 --> 15:02.325
Father, why is
the sky red?

15:07.464 --> 15:08.465
It's the Blight.

15:09.331 --> 15:10.533
But there's nothing
to worry about.

15:11.067 --> 15:13.169
It can't ruin your life.

15:38.861 --> 15:41.564
It's the Tinkerer
in person!

15:41.597 --> 15:44.133
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Everybody look at him.

15:51.573 --> 15:53.375
My dear Tinkerer,

15:53.408 --> 15:57.313
did you hear the Grafter is
blatantly refusing to find a cure?

15:57.346 --> 15:59.783
Oh, he always was
an incompetent hack.

15:59.816 --> 16:03.220
But I suggest we focus tonight
on what's really important.

16:03.253 --> 16:05.788
Wilhelm, darling.

16:05.822 --> 16:08.591
We're crackling
with anticipation.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.293
I'm riveted.

16:10.326 --> 16:12.394
We both are,
thanks to you.

16:12.427 --> 16:15.365
You're in for
a marvelous evening

16:15.398 --> 16:16.399
All of you.

16:20.602 --> 16:22.671
- Ah!
- Hello, Wilhelm.

16:22.705 --> 16:25.307
Oh, Admiral Wells,
good evening.

16:25.341 --> 16:27.477
Wonderful to see you face-to...

16:28.211 --> 16:29.111
Been so long.

16:29.145 --> 16:32.448
I've come directly
from the Biotist castle.

16:32.481 --> 16:37.254
Why does everyone keep mentioning him?
That, that, boop?

16:37.287 --> 16:39.456
The tension in the street
is growing.

16:39.956 --> 16:41.224
I see.

16:41.258 --> 16:44.494
- I'll be on the alert.
- As will I, and the Corvacks.

16:44.527 --> 16:45.729
Oh.

16:45.761 --> 16:46.795
Very good.

16:46.828 --> 16:47.830
Hmm.

16:50.866 --> 16:53.236
Blech! Ugh!

17:05.214 --> 17:07.717
Muzzlesputs!

17:10.286 --> 17:11.555
What are you doing?

17:11.587 --> 17:14.523
I'm an official guard.

17:14.557 --> 17:18.495
Official, an official
person, officially.

17:18.528 --> 17:22.766
- You broke the statue.
- Whoops, yeah, sorry about that.

17:22.798 --> 17:24.433
I like your outfit.

17:24.467 --> 17:25.469
Did you make it?

17:27.703 --> 17:28.704
Yeah.

17:30.373 --> 17:31.575
Do you think I fit in?

17:31.607 --> 17:32.608
Do you want to?

17:33.442 --> 17:35.578
- Oh, look at him!
- The humanity!

17:36.511 --> 17:37.513
I guess not.

17:39.682 --> 17:41.985
Me neither.

17:42.018 --> 17:44.554
- Do you ever...
- So I don't know if you're much...

17:47.789 --> 17:48.791
Huh?

18:05.340 --> 18:07.610
Hey, you see
those Techs?

18:07.644 --> 18:11.580
- I consider vegetarianism barbaric.
- Oh, Gary, you're incorrigible.

18:11.614 --> 18:13.016
What do you
think they're saying?

18:13.048 --> 18:16.786
Well, Lord Stupid Hat wants to
borrow the sky ship of Sir Bad Wig.

18:16.818 --> 18:18.622
- That's a wig?
- Clearly.

18:18.654 --> 18:22.392
Lord Stupid Hat has a map that
leads to some shiny treasure.

18:22.424 --> 18:25.561
So he's saying, "Please
Sir Bad Wig, lend me your ship

18:25.595 --> 18:27.497
"and I'll let you keep
half of my booty."

18:27.529 --> 18:30.333
And Bad Wig says,
"Well, polish my pewter.

18:30.365 --> 18:34.037
"That sky ship's worth more than
all of our booties put together."

18:34.069 --> 18:37.773
- The treasure map leads to the tree.
- The Great Tree?

18:37.807 --> 18:41.044
- Have you been to see it?
- Well, yeah, I was just there

18:41.076 --> 18:42.846
before I came here,
I mean.

18:42.878 --> 18:46.548
I wish I could go. I've never
been outside the castle.

18:46.582 --> 18:47.584
What's it like?

18:47.849 --> 18:48.984
Outside?

18:49.018 --> 18:50.354
It's full of adventure.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.321
I should know.

18:52.355 --> 18:55.959
After all, I'm a clown pirate
adventurer of the high skies.

18:57.826 --> 18:58.929
Or Huxley.

19:00.630 --> 19:03.467
Actually, I'm going back
to the tree later tonight.

19:04.433 --> 19:05.567
You could come along.

19:11.973 --> 19:14.443
Thank you. Thank you.

19:14.477 --> 19:15.945
<i>Welcome, welcome.</i>

19:15.979 --> 19:20.750
<i>This, my trusted Technocrats is
truly a great moment in our history.</i>

19:20.782 --> 19:25.421
<i>Unlike my previous mechanical
creations, what you are about to see</i>

19:25.454 --> 19:28.491
<i>is techno-science,
not only capable of thinking,</i>

19:29.625 --> 19:30.794
<i>but of feeling.</i>

19:30.826 --> 19:31.861
Huh?

19:31.894 --> 19:37.032
<i>This is our future.</i>

19:37.066 --> 19:43.006
With this unique machine, that
matches our own physiology,

19:43.038 --> 19:45.541
there's no problem
that techno-science,

19:46.476 --> 19:49.612
that I, cannot solve.

19:49.644 --> 19:51.347
Witness my
greatest triumph.

19:55.518 --> 19:57.453
<i>The Clockwork Girl.</i>

20:04.126 --> 20:06.462
Poppycock!

20:06.496 --> 20:09.966
Settle down, everyone. The Tinkerer
has never let us down. She's...

20:09.999 --> 20:11.835
probably just invisible.

20:11.867 --> 20:13.135
Is she invisible?

20:13.169 --> 20:14.537
No, she's copper.

20:14.569 --> 20:15.637
Burn the castle.

20:20.876 --> 20:22.745
People were everywhere.

20:22.778 --> 20:26.750
- There!
- And the father replies, "The Technocrats!"

20:26.782 --> 20:28.917
- Yikes.
- That Biotist monster's got her.

20:28.951 --> 20:30.153
Capture
the creature!

20:30.185 --> 20:31.487
Muzzlesputs.

20:31.988 --> 20:32.989
See you at the tree.

20:39.662 --> 20:42.731
This is ridiculous. He's only
a boy beast.

20:58.847 --> 21:00.450
How is he doing that?

21:08.191 --> 21:09.459
Whoa!

21:17.467 --> 21:18.468
Statue...

21:19.501 --> 21:20.503
Whoa!

21:46.496 --> 21:47.497
Are you hurt?

21:49.231 --> 21:51.835
Are you hurt? I'm asking you
a question. Did it hurt you?

21:51.867 --> 21:54.471
Huxley? No, why would he?

21:54.503 --> 21:58.740
Oh, you don't understand these things,
or what the Biotists might do to you.

21:58.773 --> 22:00.809
Now you just stay in your
room where it's safe.

22:00.843 --> 22:04.014
- Huxley was just...
- It is not a request.

22:07.884 --> 22:10.086
Oh, what a shame.

22:10.118 --> 22:13.856
That statue really
tied the room together.

22:57.732 --> 22:58.734
Tesla.

23:51.787 --> 23:55.091
Little girls shouldn't be walking
the streets by themselves.

23:55.124 --> 23:56.990
Hmm.

24:31.527 --> 24:32.728
Hey, Technocrat.

24:32.760 --> 24:36.298
- What are you doing, metalhead?
- Is she all metal?

24:36.332 --> 24:37.667
That's pretty shiny.

24:38.768 --> 24:41.804
Look at her run
on those tin legs.

24:45.141 --> 24:47.711
Is that the Clockwork
Girl we've been hearing about?

25:02.357 --> 25:05.662
Can you believe she
was the Clockwork Girl?

25:05.694 --> 25:09.098
I mean, wow, everyone was there to
see her and she was talking to me.

25:11.032 --> 25:12.635
There's no way she's
gonna show.

25:13.736 --> 25:15.972
Well, maybe, I guess.

25:21.844 --> 25:23.913
I mean, seriously, who would
want to see me?

25:24.779 --> 25:25.914
What are you doing?

25:25.948 --> 25:29.219
Hey, you escaped.

25:29.919 --> 25:31.688
You're the one
who escaped.

25:31.721 --> 25:34.423
- I just snuck away.
- Oh, yeah.

25:34.457 --> 25:35.958
That was exciting.

25:35.990 --> 25:37.960
I was worried that T-Bolt
was gonna catch you.

25:37.992 --> 25:39.761
What's a T-Bolt?

25:39.795 --> 25:41.798
Oh, the big mechanical man.

25:41.830 --> 25:43.932
My father made him
long before he made me.

25:43.965 --> 25:46.435
Your father got way
better at making stuff.

25:47.236 --> 25:48.238
Thanks.

25:49.371 --> 25:50.740
I wanna show
you something.

25:51.906 --> 25:52.908
Come on up.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.413
You're very good at climbing.

25:57.445 --> 25:59.448
Retractable toenails.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.228
Pretty grand,
isn't it?

26:13.429 --> 26:15.865
That's your Technocrat
Manor over there.

26:15.897 --> 26:19.434
And that, that's the Biotists
Arboretum, where I live.

26:19.468 --> 26:21.070
They're so far apart.

26:21.103 --> 26:22.839
Well, I...

26:22.872 --> 26:24.708
I think people prefer
it that way.

26:26.142 --> 26:29.178
Hey, I just realized,
I still don't know your name.

26:29.211 --> 26:30.413
Oh, um,

26:32.548 --> 26:34.750
- Tesla.
- Tesla.

26:35.851 --> 26:37.820
I like it.

26:37.853 --> 26:40.190
My dad made the Marmakeets
the same way he made me,

26:41.356 --> 26:43.225
I guess he got better
making stuff, too.

26:45.994 --> 26:49.030
At least,
I like to think he did.

26:49.064 --> 26:52.435
- You're not mechanical.
- No, I was grown.

26:52.468 --> 26:55.238
My dad grafted me
from a bunch of stuff.

26:55.270 --> 27:00.109
He added a second heart and
parts of beasts and kind of...

27:01.911 --> 27:03.846
I think it involved sewing.

27:03.878 --> 27:05.414
You have two hearts?

27:05.681 --> 27:06.883
Yeah.

27:07.215 --> 27:08.283
Here.

27:18.124 --> 27:18.528
Thank you for showing
me everything.

27:20.028 --> 27:21.029
Huxley,

27:22.064 --> 27:23.432
I'd like to show
you something.

27:30.605 --> 27:32.307
Wh...

27:32.340 --> 27:33.842
I'm seeing what you see!

27:34.476 --> 27:36.045
This is grand.

28:02.637 --> 28:04.307
Whoa!

28:05.106 --> 28:06.509
What's all that?

28:06.541 --> 28:07.943
Those red bits?

28:07.977 --> 28:11.281
Mmm, my father
called it the Blight.

28:12.347 --> 28:14.250
You can see the Blight?

28:14.983 --> 28:16.586
That's where
it gets thickest.

28:17.553 --> 28:19.022
- See.
- Muzzle...

28:20.055 --> 28:21.423
This is mammoth,

28:21.457 --> 28:24.861
all the sickness,
all the storms.

28:24.894 --> 28:27.262
Then the people
my father helps,

28:27.296 --> 28:29.999
the ones who are sick,
that's because of the Blight?

28:30.031 --> 28:31.967
That's what
the Blight is.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.172
It hurts people and animals.
It's destroying everything.

28:36.204 --> 28:39.308
- If the Blight is coming from the castle...
- They're trying to hurt people,

28:40.174 --> 28:42.010
with the Blight.

28:42.044 --> 28:43.613
We should tell our parents.

28:43.645 --> 28:46.515
Yeah, I don't know if
that's such a good idea.

28:47.982 --> 28:50.452
Okay, over there
is Admiral Wells' base.

28:50.486 --> 28:52.121
That's where the airships are.

28:52.153 --> 28:53.823
Now we should be
able to borrow one,

28:53.855 --> 28:58.228
fly to the Ancients' castle, and return the
airship before anyone notices it's gone.

28:59.094 --> 29:00.096
Should be easy.

29:02.964 --> 29:04.900
Hello there,
little metal.

29:04.933 --> 29:06.402
We thought we lost you.

29:06.434 --> 29:10.005
Not safe for little Techs
to be out so late.

29:11.606 --> 29:13.174
- What do you want?
- Hey!

29:13.208 --> 29:14.442
I know you.

29:14.476 --> 29:16.579
You're the most
Bio of us all!

29:16.612 --> 29:18.413
What are you doing
with this Tech?

29:18.446 --> 29:20.649
We're friends,
leave us alone.

29:20.682 --> 29:22.652
Techs and Bios
can't be friends.

29:22.684 --> 29:25.086
Hey, guys,
check it out.

29:25.119 --> 29:27.122
This one's all peg.

29:31.660 --> 29:33.062
- Come here!
- No!

29:39.634 --> 29:41.103
Argh!

29:41.135 --> 29:42.905
Oh, my spleen.

29:45.406 --> 29:46.408
Huxley!

29:47.375 --> 29:48.377
Let's go.

29:51.579 --> 29:54.383
- Ow, my lip. I bit my tongue.
- It hurts.

29:54.415 --> 29:56.152
That's gotta hurt.

29:56.184 --> 29:57.386
Ow, my ankle.

30:04.993 --> 30:05.994
Can you swim?

30:06.327 --> 30:07.363
Seriously?

30:07.395 --> 30:08.630
Oh, yeah, right.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.615
There.

30:59.881 --> 31:01.517
Huh?

31:01.549 --> 31:03.019
The garbage hatch.

31:22.805 --> 31:24.007
Won't it be guarded?

31:24.673 --> 31:25.673
We'll have to be careful.

31:25.708 --> 31:28.644
Guards for a trash chute?
I seriously doubt it.

31:28.676 --> 31:31.179
Just keep your key top
down, and stay close to me.

31:54.368 --> 31:55.670
I've got it all figured.

31:55.703 --> 31:57.673
We'll come out near
the core, right?

31:57.705 --> 32:00.141
It'll be completely
empty this time of day.

32:00.174 --> 32:03.645
And from there we'll have easy
access to the docking branches.

32:03.679 --> 32:07.450
You stick to the shadows, stay quiet,
and run to the nearest airship.

32:07.482 --> 32:10.552
You should be able to figure
out how to fly it. Sound good?

32:10.586 --> 32:12.221
Are you sure?

32:12.253 --> 32:13.421
What about the Corvacks?

32:13.454 --> 32:15.557
We're clown
pirates, remember?

32:15.590 --> 32:17.158
I know what I'm doing.

32:17.192 --> 32:19.394
There won't be a
Corvack in sight.

32:19.428 --> 32:20.763
Let's go!

32:23.565 --> 32:26.134
Huxley,
I see Corvacks.

32:40.182 --> 32:41.483
Where have you
taken Huxley?

32:44.219 --> 32:45.221
Where's Huxley?

32:55.430 --> 32:58.267
The Tinkerer has been
informed of your presence here.

32:58.299 --> 32:59.367
Oh, I...

33:00.868 --> 33:02.704
Well, we've discovered
something important.

33:03.471 --> 33:05.141
It's about
the Ancients' castle.

33:05.173 --> 33:07.475
The Ancients'
castle is forbidden.

33:07.509 --> 33:10.712
- We need to go there.
- The Ancients' castle is forbidden.

33:16.617 --> 33:17.653
Are you all right?

33:19.621 --> 33:21.557
Get her out of here.

33:21.589 --> 33:23.424
Restrict her to one
of the upper cells.

34:22.818 --> 34:24.720
I didn't expect
your arrival so soon.

34:25.987 --> 34:27.589
Where is she? Is she...

34:27.623 --> 34:28.691
We have her contained.

34:28.724 --> 34:29.892
Has she been hurt?

34:29.925 --> 34:31.927
She appears undamaged.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.329
I doubt the monster
boy has affected her worth.

34:34.362 --> 34:38.333
That beast should be kept in a cage,
like the rest of Dendrus' mistakes.

34:38.367 --> 34:41.704
I think you'll be satisfied by his punishment.

34:42.637 --> 34:43.672
Thank you, Admiral.

34:45.907 --> 34:48.344
And thank you for rescuing
my Clockwork Girl.

34:49.811 --> 34:53.315
- I'll take her home, now.
- Patience.

34:53.347 --> 34:54.882
Your construction will
be returned to you

34:54.916 --> 34:58.287
once we've performed
the necessary cleansing.

34:58.320 --> 35:01.690
- What do you mean?
- The monster's influence has made her,

35:01.722 --> 35:02.958
mmm...

35:02.990 --> 35:04.592
less than pure.

35:04.626 --> 35:07.263
We'll let her wind down
and erase her memory.

35:07.295 --> 35:10.932
She'll then be returned to you,
uncorrupted, a blank slate.

35:10.965 --> 35:12.467
But...

35:12.501 --> 35:14.503
But she'll
be helpless.

35:14.536 --> 35:16.838
She won't
remember anything.

35:16.871 --> 35:19.807
She won't
even remember me.

35:19.840 --> 35:20.942
It's for the best.

35:22.710 --> 35:25.880
But she's...
she's my daughter,

35:25.914 --> 35:30.486
And I will not allow you
to lay a hand on her.

35:30.518 --> 35:32.287
You, allow me?

35:32.320 --> 35:34.722
You forget your
place, scientist.

35:34.755 --> 35:37.025
Don't forget what happens
to those who cross me.

35:38.492 --> 35:39.927
You'll get
your invention back.

35:39.960 --> 35:42.697
- That's what matters, correct?
- No, I want her back now.

35:42.731 --> 35:46.035
You're fortunate that most of
your construction can be salvaged.

35:46.068 --> 35:48.037
The monster will need
to be disposed of.

35:48.070 --> 35:49.372
Disposed of?

35:49.405 --> 35:53.676
He'll be held in the sunken prison
until he's executed by wire.

35:53.708 --> 35:56.644
Keep in mind, that
your Clockwork Girl

35:56.677 --> 36:00.715
- could easily share his fate.
- Are you threatening her?

36:00.748 --> 36:02.917
Disorder is a threat.

36:02.951 --> 36:07.423
- Foolish sentimentality is a threat.
- You cannot do this.

36:07.456 --> 36:09.557
Your anger is misplaced.

36:09.590 --> 36:11.960
It's the monster that's
to blame for all of this,

36:11.992 --> 36:14.063
and do not attempt
to go after her.

36:14.096 --> 36:17.632
The upper floors of the base are heavily
guarded by Corvacks, thanks to you.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.002
She's out of your reach.

36:26.842 --> 36:29.845
Very well, Admiral.
I'll see myself out.

38:14.014 --> 38:18.453
- I don't understand.
- Quiet, I can't do this by myself.

38:18.487 --> 38:19.988
Now you're gonna have
to climb the tower.

38:20.021 --> 38:23.057
I'll go to the control room,
and I'll slow the Corvacks down.

38:24.693 --> 38:25.694
Save my daughter.

38:27.996 --> 38:31.166
And try to ignore your natural
impulses to do something stupid.

38:33.635 --> 38:34.637
Go.

38:38.706 --> 38:40.675
The Blight's coming
from the Ancients' castle.

38:41.208 --> 38:42.477
Tesla can see it.

38:43.110 --> 38:44.112
Tesla?

39:38.967 --> 39:39.969
Hmm?

39:58.320 --> 40:00.523
Okay. Okay.

40:07.094 --> 40:08.596
Hello.

40:08.630 --> 40:11.166
- You escaped?
- No, I just snuck away.

40:11.932 --> 40:12.934
Let's go.

40:27.648 --> 40:30.152
These controls
are terrible.

40:30.184 --> 40:33.755
I should really stop talking to myself.
That's what crazy people do, isn't it?

40:34.123 --> 40:35.124
Yes, it is.

40:38.927 --> 40:39.961
Corvacks!

40:40.961 --> 40:41.963
Strike!

40:45.000 --> 40:46.568
Didn't know they
could do that.

40:57.945 --> 40:59.714
Argh! The locks are jammed.

40:59.748 --> 41:01.182
Someone's at the controls.

41:12.059 --> 41:13.061
Over there.

41:15.096 --> 41:17.099
If we fall
into those, we're toast.

41:20.335 --> 41:21.802
Tesla!

41:23.405 --> 41:24.706
Duck!

41:24.739 --> 41:25.740
Hold on.

41:40.188 --> 41:41.356
Muzzlesputs.

41:44.726 --> 41:45.728
Thank you.

41:47.094 --> 41:48.096
It's gonna fall.

42:04.179 --> 42:06.248
Whoa, hey,
get off, get off.

42:23.063 --> 42:24.266
Well, that was lucky.

42:35.043 --> 42:36.278
- Keep going!
- Huxley?

42:36.311 --> 42:39.247
You go ahead, get us a ship.
I'll take care of this one.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.449
Are you sure?

42:40.481 --> 42:42.016
I don't know
how to fly an airship.

43:13.347 --> 43:14.349
Huh?

43:30.465 --> 43:31.500
Thanks.

43:37.972 --> 43:40.142
You'd better be
going straight home.

43:59.827 --> 44:00.929
Oh.

44:02.063 --> 44:04.432
- Stop them!
- Hit it.

44:13.340 --> 44:15.043
Ooh...

44:24.885 --> 44:27.054
Pull up, pull up.

44:27.088 --> 44:28.490
I can't, she's above us.

44:32.626 --> 44:34.829
Hold on tight!

44:34.862 --> 44:39.867
What are you...

44:51.179 --> 44:54.817
I think we've escaped.

45:04.559 --> 45:06.327
She is pushy.

45:17.338 --> 45:18.440
Huh?

45:19.407 --> 45:21.175
Tesla, slow.

45:22.443 --> 45:24.211
Slow...

46:39.586 --> 46:42.190
Fast. Fast, fast, fast!

46:42.222 --> 46:44.326
This is fast!

46:44.358 --> 46:45.693
She is
really good at this.

46:45.726 --> 46:47.429
She's probably
done it before.

46:50.063 --> 46:52.232
You toothless,
low stone, muzzlesputs!

46:54.902 --> 46:58.339
Lower, or higher. Try higher.

46:58.373 --> 47:01.041
Huxley, hold on.

47:01.074 --> 47:03.243
How can you
still be hungry?

47:11.052 --> 47:12.653
Here it comes.

47:20.061 --> 47:24.032
- Huxley, the shield.
- Oh, not so grand. Look out!

47:28.603 --> 47:30.204
It's coming apart on us.

47:40.181 --> 47:41.282
New idea.

47:55.695 --> 47:57.098
Almost there.

48:06.706 --> 48:09.010
- Were you scared?
- I was terrified.

48:09.844 --> 48:11.179
Well done.

48:11.211 --> 48:14.315
- Any sign of Wells?
- None.

48:14.347 --> 48:17.152
The motor's giving out. I need to land.

48:29.197 --> 48:31.465
Did we find them?

48:31.498 --> 48:35.469
Then have T-Bolt lower the castle's
defenses and keep them down.

48:35.503 --> 48:38.405
That's the one place
we know they're headed.

48:52.753 --> 48:55.856
- Can you figure out how to fix it?
- I think so.

48:55.889 --> 48:58.157
I mended one of
the interior propellers

48:58.159 --> 49:01.128
by using a piece of metal
from the damaged fuselage.

49:01.161 --> 49:03.263
You're pretty good at this.

49:03.297 --> 49:06.168
My father taught me how to build
things, and fix them.

49:07.869 --> 49:10.505
- Do you think he's all right?
- I don't know.

49:15.543 --> 49:18.780
At least Admiral Wells
likes your dad, doesn't she?

49:18.813 --> 49:20.715
I saw them talking
together at the unveiling.

49:22.550 --> 49:23.718
I suppose so.

49:25.652 --> 49:28.655
She always gives
my dad a hard time.

49:28.688 --> 49:30.424
Now he's really
in trouble,

49:31.525 --> 49:34.128
because of me.

49:34.161 --> 49:37.464
People only listen to Wells
because they're afraid...

49:37.498 --> 49:42.369
afraid of the Blight,
of the Ancients, everything,

49:43.271 --> 49:46.240
But... we can change that.

49:49.577 --> 49:51.146
It'll be an adventure.

50:01.454 --> 50:02.690
Huxley?

50:12.500 --> 50:13.501
Wilhelm?

50:16.737 --> 50:19.706
Ugh, what
possible function...

50:19.739 --> 50:22.643
The hydrobot? It's attracted
to the smell of metal.

50:22.677 --> 50:23.979
Dendrus?

50:24.012 --> 50:28.316
It's wonderful for clearing the
soil of industrial pollutants.

50:28.349 --> 50:30.751
Only you would stick something
so disgusting in a hole

50:30.784 --> 50:32.286
and call it wonderful.

50:32.320 --> 50:34.255
If you're finished,

50:34.288 --> 50:37.458
you might want to tell
me why you're here now,

50:37.490 --> 50:41.929
trespassing in my arboretum,
upsetting my hydrobot.

50:43.731 --> 50:45.567
It's about our children.

50:50.438 --> 50:51.539
Oh...

51:05.952 --> 51:08.422
Do you know what
the Ancients look like?

51:08.456 --> 51:12.561
Like us... I mean, not like us,
like everybody else.

51:13.927 --> 51:15.196
I think.

51:17.264 --> 51:18.900
Well,
haven't you seen them?

51:18.932 --> 51:20.768
No, but my dad has.

51:20.800 --> 51:23.672
- He says they wear face masks...
- Like Admiral Wells.

51:24.739 --> 51:26.240
Or the Corvacks.

51:50.297 --> 51:51.632
What happened?

51:52.532 --> 51:53.902
This place is a wreck.

51:55.503 --> 51:56.638
It's so sad.

51:58.405 --> 51:59.907
Do you think it's a trick?

52:01.309 --> 52:02.377
I'm not sure.

52:05.012 --> 52:06.948
You should be careful.

52:12.987 --> 52:15.889
Whoa.

52:16.657 --> 52:18.593
Where is everybody?

52:22.496 --> 52:25.300
Wow.

52:26.599 --> 52:29.304
Sheesh.

52:45.385 --> 52:46.387
Hey, Tesla...

52:48.356 --> 52:49.791
look at this.

52:55.028 --> 52:56.331
Huxley?

52:59.666 --> 53:00.735
Huxley?

53:02.402 --> 53:04.538
Yeah,
it's me.

53:05.472 --> 53:06.440
Did I get you?

53:06.474 --> 53:09.043
Huxley, we need
to take this more seriously.

53:09.076 --> 53:12.579
Wow, what a gem.

53:15.449 --> 53:17.485
Let's go.

53:17.518 --> 53:19.387
Ooh.

53:34.467 --> 53:37.905
- This place is completely abandoned?
- Shh.

54:07.501 --> 54:09.571
You, Wells.

54:10.905 --> 54:13.574
I suspected
it would come to this.

54:13.606 --> 54:15.909
Where are the Ancients?
What have you done to them?

54:15.943 --> 54:18.146
You've made
a terrible mistake coming here.

54:18.179 --> 54:21.816
- We followed the Blight.
- You lied to everybody.

54:21.849 --> 54:23.918
You've been
keeping people sick.

54:23.951 --> 54:26.454
And you kept everyone away
so nobody would find out.

54:27.688 --> 54:30.557
You killed
the Ancients, didn't you?

54:30.590 --> 54:34.161
I refuse to justify myself to a failed experiment.

54:34.195 --> 54:35.530
You're a traitor!

54:35.563 --> 54:41.436
I was betrayed, left behind to
keep order before you even existed.

54:41.469 --> 54:42.903
Liar!

54:42.936 --> 54:44.605
Doesn't matter
what you believe?

54:45.005 --> 54:46.706
Not anymore.

54:46.739 --> 54:49.643
Huxley, I don't think
she's lying.

54:50.710 --> 54:52.746
They did leave you.

54:52.780 --> 54:57.718
When the world got sick,
they left all of us, and you.

54:57.751 --> 55:00.086
You took power without
anyone knowing it.

55:00.119 --> 55:03.056
When the Blight started, I came
here to the Ancients' castle

55:03.090 --> 55:04.459
to seek their guidance,

55:05.025 --> 55:06.760
but they were gone.

55:06.793 --> 55:09.596
They had abandoned
all of us.

55:09.630 --> 55:12.934
Somebody had to protect
Haraway, to guide its progress.

55:12.967 --> 55:14.101
You haven't protected anyone.

55:14.134 --> 55:15.603
Without someone
to lead them,

55:15.635 --> 55:17.838
the city would have
fallen into chaos.

55:17.871 --> 55:20.707
It fell to me,
to keep the people safe.

55:20.740 --> 55:22.210
I always have.

55:22.242 --> 55:27.181
I keep them from knowing
how alone they truly are.

55:27.213 --> 55:28.482
No, no, listen!

55:29.317 --> 55:32.152
The Blight is coming
from this castle.

55:32.186 --> 55:36.658
The castle is a symbol
of order, of hope.

55:37.724 --> 55:39.661
I won't let you
take that away.

55:40.661 --> 55:43.831
You've left me
no alternative.

55:43.864 --> 55:45.566
Huxley, we have to show her.

55:45.599 --> 55:48.769
We are not the helpless
children you think we are.

55:48.802 --> 55:52.073
I've never once
considered you a child.

55:58.846 --> 56:00.715
- Murderer!
- Not yet!

56:00.748 --> 56:02.215
Duck!

56:19.934 --> 56:22.604
Whoa!

57:09.682 --> 57:11.085
Huxley, hurry!

57:18.257 --> 57:20.093
- Are you all right?
- Corvacks!

57:20.126 --> 57:21.962
Attack!

57:23.664 --> 57:24.832
Run!

57:47.387 --> 57:48.623
What is it?

57:54.360 --> 57:55.963
I have an idea.

58:00.300 --> 58:03.204
On your feet.
You're losing them.

58:35.168 --> 58:38.938
So, where do you
think it leads?

58:38.972 --> 58:41.442
I don't know. Did you hear that?

58:43.811 --> 58:44.979
She's coming.

58:54.387 --> 58:57.458
What is it?
Some kind of furnace?

58:57.490 --> 58:58.925
No...

58:58.958 --> 59:01.795
Not a furnace.
The castle's heart.

59:01.829 --> 59:05.432
- Oh...
- It's the source of the Blight. Huxley, we found it.

59:13.806 --> 59:15.342
I recognize these.

59:25.018 --> 59:27.288
- Tesla, she's here.
- T-Bolt?

59:27.320 --> 59:30.257
T-Bolt, you have to help us, please.

59:30.289 --> 59:32.523
That guy?

59:32.525 --> 59:33.728
Again?

59:36.096 --> 59:37.931
Let us pass.

59:37.965 --> 59:40.468
What's beyond that door?

59:40.501 --> 59:42.403
Only the engine room.

59:43.170 --> 59:44.405
Nowhere to hide.

59:47.074 --> 59:48.076
What are these?

59:49.175 --> 59:50.277
They shouldn't be here.

59:51.445 --> 59:53.380
Have you done this?

59:53.413 --> 59:57.083
T-Bolt, I demand that
you answer me at once.

59:58.885 --> 1:00:02.889
Do not speak to me
as though I were a servant.

1:00:02.922 --> 1:00:05.358
- So he can talk now?
- Wells wasn't lying.

1:00:05.391 --> 1:00:08.027
She didn't know that the Blight
was coming from the castle.

1:00:08.061 --> 1:00:10.931
Explain the meaning
of this, this treachery.

1:00:24.577 --> 1:00:29.115
You should be honored. You've just
met the greatest inventor of all time.

1:00:29.148 --> 1:00:31.918
So you made yourself taller.
So what?

1:00:31.952 --> 1:00:34.421
This?
This is nothing.

1:00:34.454 --> 1:00:39.460
I'm talking about an invention that
changed the entire world for the better.

1:00:39.492 --> 1:00:41.362
He means the Blight.

1:00:41.394 --> 1:00:44.297
- He started it.
- How?

1:00:44.331 --> 1:00:48.135
I worked in the Tinkerer's lab,
studied the Grafter's methods

1:00:48.168 --> 1:00:51.338
and created a device
more complicated than any human,

1:00:51.371 --> 1:00:55.175
any petty, selfish,
cowardly human could understand.

1:00:55.208 --> 1:00:58.344
- I understand.
- Shut up! Shut up!

1:00:58.378 --> 1:01:02.516
And when the
Tinkerer passed me off to Admiral Wells,

1:01:02.548 --> 1:01:06.420
I found the perfect place
for my invention to thrive.

1:01:08.621 --> 1:01:10.390
It worked.

1:01:10.423 --> 1:01:12.458
Then, you're the reason
the Ancients left.

1:01:12.492 --> 1:01:14.495
They didn't leave.

1:01:14.527 --> 1:01:17.564
Let's just say they were
the first victims of the Blight.

1:01:17.597 --> 1:01:19.599
That can't be true.

1:01:19.632 --> 1:01:24.038
Ha, it's your turn now
to obey my orders,

1:01:24.070 --> 1:01:26.306
to fear me.

1:01:29.909 --> 1:01:30.911
Now's our chance.

1:01:43.123 --> 1:01:44.592
It's too hot.

1:01:44.625 --> 1:01:46.293
We'll see.

1:01:46.326 --> 1:01:49.563
You can't, it only
gets worse further in.

1:01:49.596 --> 1:01:52.833
- There's... There's gotta be a way.
- There is.

1:01:54.034 --> 1:01:55.269
I'll go alone.

1:01:55.302 --> 1:01:58.305
No, no, no, no,
it's too dangerous.

1:01:58.338 --> 1:02:00.975
You're starting
to sound like my father.

1:02:01.007 --> 1:02:02.542
I'm a cloud pirate,
remember?

1:02:05.077 --> 1:02:06.480
I'll wait here for you.

1:02:06.512 --> 1:02:08.114
I'll keep them
from getting in.

1:02:32.072 --> 1:02:33.140
The source.

1:02:58.130 --> 1:02:59.634
Hey, toolbox!

1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:01.936
Yeah, that's right,

1:03:01.969 --> 1:03:04.070
I'm talking to you, T-Screw.

1:03:04.103 --> 1:03:05.405
I'm still here.

1:03:05.438 --> 1:03:07.607
She's gone ahead
without you, has she?

1:03:07.641 --> 1:03:09.210
Fitting.

1:03:15.047 --> 1:03:16.416
Gah!

1:03:27.260 --> 1:03:29.396
Oh, muzzlesputs.

1:03:40.474 --> 1:03:42.543
Impressive, isn't it?

1:03:49.782 --> 1:03:53.420
So weak. It seems
the Tinkerer was as negligent

1:03:53.452 --> 1:03:55.655
with your planning
as he was with mine.

1:03:55.688 --> 1:03:58.524
But you know, the best thing about being mechanical,

1:03:58.557 --> 1:04:02.262
is the ability to improve
on your initial blueprint.

1:04:04.498 --> 1:04:06.166
I could show you how.

1:04:06.199 --> 1:04:07.634
What are you talking about?

1:04:16.275 --> 1:04:20.547
At the moment, my invention is
barely affecting the world below us.

1:04:20.579 --> 1:04:23.483
It's already ruined lives.
Even the sky is sick with it.

1:04:23.516 --> 1:04:25.351
We can do better than that.

1:04:25.385 --> 1:04:28.022
Uh... we?

1:04:28.054 --> 1:04:30.590
You're lucky, you
have the chance,

1:04:30.623 --> 1:04:34.560
<i>no, the honor to join me,</i>

1:04:34.594 --> 1:04:38.599
<i>to take the next step
into a new age of strength,</i>

1:04:38.632 --> 1:04:41.101
untainted by
human weakness.

1:04:41.134 --> 1:04:43.036
I liked it better
when you didn't talk.

1:04:43.070 --> 1:04:45.506
Well, there's
a backup plan.

1:05:02.322 --> 1:05:04.557
Think of it as
a kind of cleanse.

1:05:05.492 --> 1:05:08.429
You and I make
the Blight engine stronger,

1:05:08.461 --> 1:05:12.065
thereby ridding ourselves
of all humanity...

1:05:12.099 --> 1:05:16.303
plants, animals,
all living things.

1:05:16.335 --> 1:05:19.806
We'll engineer others like us,
pure mechanical minds.

1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:23.177
It will be
an industrial revolution.

1:05:39.326 --> 1:05:41.695
You know what I think?

1:05:41.728 --> 1:05:43.864
That rainbows are
your favorite color?

1:05:43.896 --> 1:05:46.400
If you were as pure a
machine as you say you are,

1:05:46.432 --> 1:05:49.235
you wouldn't be
this angry.

1:05:49.268 --> 1:05:53.873
At least I'm not some
incompetent little parasite like you

1:05:53.907 --> 1:05:56.777
with some patchwork dog
boy as my great defender.

1:06:02.414 --> 1:06:06.353
Though he won't be
much use to you now, will he?

1:06:08.621 --> 1:06:10.090
No!

1:06:10.489 --> 1:06:11.891
Huxley?

1:06:16.630 --> 1:06:17.765
Careful!

1:06:18.864 --> 1:06:21.134
Huxley, are you okay?

1:06:23.670 --> 1:06:25.706
Oh, did I forget
to mention,

1:06:25.739 --> 1:06:27.641
I dealt with Wells
so quickly

1:06:27.673 --> 1:06:29.543
that I had all the time
in the world

1:06:29.576 --> 1:06:31.911
to finish off your little friend.

1:06:31.945 --> 1:06:33.581
So tragic.

1:06:34.547 --> 1:06:36.182
You will join me,
you know,

1:06:36.215 --> 1:06:38.451
whether you want to
or not.

1:06:38.485 --> 1:06:42.556
You see, all I have to do is stop
your heart, let you wind down,

1:06:42.588 --> 1:06:47.860
and all your memories,
everything you care for, will be gone.

1:06:47.893 --> 1:06:49.829
You'll love it.

1:06:49.862 --> 1:06:52.565
Hmm?

1:07:03.577 --> 1:07:05.445
- Dad?
- It's all right, I've got you.

1:07:06.980 --> 1:07:09.615
You brought
the Marmakeet?

1:07:09.648 --> 1:07:10.750
Where's Tesla?

1:07:14.487 --> 1:07:16.590
Oh, he's fine.

1:07:16.623 --> 1:07:20.427
Dad, look, I'm sorry
we came by ourselves.

1:07:20.460 --> 1:07:21.695
We should have waited.

1:07:21.728 --> 1:07:25.965
Well, I'm sorry
I almost hit you to the sky.

1:07:27.701 --> 1:07:31.237
Muzzlesputs.

1:07:36.876 --> 1:07:40.214
Corvacks, fall back.

1:07:40.646 --> 1:07:42.215
Wells.

1:07:44.516 --> 1:07:47.954
Let them be.
Attack the automatons.

1:08:03.670 --> 1:08:07.541
- Where is my daughter?
- She's in there. With T-Bolt.

1:08:07.574 --> 1:08:09.242
He's the one
that started the Blight.

1:08:09.275 --> 1:08:10.376
T-Bolt?

1:08:11.577 --> 1:08:13.581
Then, it's my fault.

1:08:22.288 --> 1:08:25.591
Call it an act of mercy,
my killing Huxley.

1:08:25.625 --> 1:08:27.360
At least now, he'll...

1:08:28.795 --> 1:08:31.297
He'll never get sick
the way Father...

1:08:33.899 --> 1:08:35.402
Your father will!

1:08:35.435 --> 1:08:37.938
And Dendrus
and everyone else!

1:08:37.970 --> 1:08:39.772
It's not going
to happen.

1:08:42.908 --> 1:08:45.378
You couldn't
do it alone, could you?

1:08:45.412 --> 1:08:48.548
I understand,
you are lonely.

1:08:48.581 --> 1:08:52.252
You're doing this because of him, because of our father.

1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:55.656
You needed
to make him see you.

1:08:59.059 --> 1:09:02.929
T-Bolt, you're my brother,
we can stop this. It's not too late.

1:09:02.962 --> 1:09:04.965
Father can fix you,
I know he will.

1:09:04.997 --> 1:09:06.466
He means nothing
to me!

1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:11.371
No, don't touch it!

1:09:11.404 --> 1:09:13.907
You need help.
Let us help you.

1:09:13.939 --> 1:09:15.975
I need nothing!

1:09:20.380 --> 1:09:21.847
No!

1:09:46.372 --> 1:09:47.607
Tesla!

1:09:50.810 --> 1:09:53.614
No, wait, Huxley!

1:09:58.083 --> 1:09:59.452
Tesla.

1:10:00.686 --> 1:10:02.323
Tesla, where are you?

1:10:02.922 --> 1:10:04.324
Huxley.

1:10:04.725 --> 1:10:05.926
Tesla?

1:10:08.427 --> 1:10:10.396
A-are you all right?
Are you...

1:10:11.898 --> 1:10:15.402
Oh, I shouldn't
have let you. Stupid.

1:10:19.773 --> 1:10:20.774
Tesla?

1:10:23.009 --> 1:10:25.011
Oh, Tesla, I'm sorry.

1:10:25.779 --> 1:10:26.980
Huxley...

1:10:28.715 --> 1:10:30.117
The same?

1:10:30.149 --> 1:10:32.018
That's right.

1:10:32.051 --> 1:10:33.653
That's right,
we're the same.

1:10:37.590 --> 1:10:40.461
No, no, no, no.
No, come on.

1:10:45.198 --> 1:10:47.801
- We're the same.
- Huxley.

1:10:55.608 --> 1:10:58.145
She did it.

1:11:05.452 --> 1:11:09.422
I shouldn't have let
her go, it was too hot, and...

1:11:10.789 --> 1:11:12.024
I shouldn't have let her go.

1:11:16.061 --> 1:11:18.899
Without the engine,
the castle will fall.

1:11:18.931 --> 1:11:22.402
If you want to live,
we must leave this place.

1:11:29.576 --> 1:11:30.778
To the ship!

1:11:35.215 --> 1:11:37.851
Look out!

1:11:37.884 --> 1:11:40.753
Keep going.

1:11:49.628 --> 1:11:50.863
No!

1:12:10.716 --> 1:12:13.552
Can you fix it?
Bring her back?

1:12:13.586 --> 1:12:14.887
I don't know.

1:12:14.921 --> 1:12:16.722
Her heart is shattered.

1:12:16.756 --> 1:12:20.894
- If these gears stop, she'll...
- Take one of mine, fix her.

1:12:20.926 --> 1:12:24.096
- Absolutely not.
- It's impossible, it would never work.

1:12:24.130 --> 1:12:26.032
Well, why not?

1:12:26.064 --> 1:12:30.069
Tinkerer, you've been grafting
machines on humans for years.

1:12:30.103 --> 1:12:33.507
It should work
the other way around.

1:12:33.539 --> 1:12:39.546
And, Dad, you are the greatest
grafter the world has ever known.

1:12:39.578 --> 1:12:41.914
But, son, it's
very dangerous.

1:12:41.948 --> 1:12:44.618
- With only one heart, you'll be very weak...
- Fix Tesla.

1:12:45.085 --> 1:12:46.819
It's hers already.

1:12:48.054 --> 1:12:50.824
Dad, we can save her.

1:12:54.060 --> 1:12:56.563
Wilhelm?

1:12:56.595 --> 1:13:00.900
Well, I guess in theory, it is
possible, but we don't have much time.

1:13:04.570 --> 1:13:05.738
Huxley?

1:13:07.640 --> 1:13:10.277
Drink this. Lie down.

1:13:16.849 --> 1:13:20.186
- Can you get us out of here?
- Don't talk.

1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:23.590
Careful,
watch your head.

1:14:08.935 --> 1:14:11.371
Huxley, can you hear me?

1:14:11.404 --> 1:14:13.273
You're going to be
very unsteady.

1:14:13.305 --> 1:14:15.007
Don't try to move just yet.

1:14:18.677 --> 1:14:21.314
- Is she okay?
- We don't know yet, son.

1:14:21.614 --> 1:14:23.182
Wait.

1:14:23.216 --> 1:14:26.386
Come on, easy now.

1:14:33.359 --> 1:14:35.929
Hello, Father.

1:14:39.666 --> 1:14:40.667
You did it.

1:14:42.335 --> 1:14:43.703
Huxley.

1:14:45.337 --> 1:14:47.073
Careful.

1:14:51.844 --> 1:14:53.713
You'll make him
a new heart, won't you?

1:14:54.780 --> 1:14:56.248
Together?

1:14:56.282 --> 1:14:59.719
- Well, that shouldn't be a problem, should it, Dendrus?
- No.

1:14:59.752 --> 1:15:01.254
Not if you
don't muck it up.

1:15:01.287 --> 1:15:04.157
At least they didn't call me
pickle fingers in the old days.

1:15:04.189 --> 1:15:06.158
You're the only person
who called me that.

1:15:06.192 --> 1:15:08.094
I may have
pioneered that, yes.

1:15:08.127 --> 1:15:11.097
Oh, the same way you pioneered
bolting your foot to the floor?

1:15:11.130 --> 1:15:14.734
Now hold on,
that was a faulty drill.

1:15:14.766 --> 1:15:16.735
I still tell everyone
about that time

1:15:16.769 --> 1:15:19.905
your first cross-bred creature
tried to devour...

1:15:35.220 --> 1:15:37.189
Stay out of trouble.

1:15:44.363 --> 1:15:46.199
Cloud pirates, right?

1:15:46.765 --> 1:15:49.101
Heroes of the high skies.

1:15:58.144 --> 1:16:01.948
Wait, look at that.

1:16:04.050 --> 1:16:05.085
Wow.

1:16:19.431 --> 1:16:21.100
Hey, Tes,
look at this.

1:16:24.036 --> 1:16:27.740
- Up here.
- Huxley!

1:16:29.041 --> 1:16:30.277
Huxley, look.

1:16:35.948 --> 1:16:37.284
Watch that branch.

1:16:39.217 --> 1:16:42.287
So, my father says
he'll build us an airship

1:16:42.320 --> 1:16:43.957
if I promise him one thing.

1:16:43.989 --> 1:16:47.059
Oh, yeah,
and what's that?

1:16:47.092 --> 1:16:49.528
That you'll never fly it.

1:16:49.561 --> 1:16:53.932
Yeah, well, I'm more of a
pirate than a pilot, anyway.

1:16:53.966 --> 1:16:58.104
You worry about flying us,
and I'll worry about hidden treasure.

1:16:58.136 --> 1:17:00.206
Where do you
want to look first?

1:17:01.373 --> 1:17:02.742
Everywhere.

1:17:03.509 --> 1:17:06.279
Everywhere sounds good.

1:17:06.311 --> 1:17:08.414
For a start.

1:18:34.300 --> 1:18:37.503
Fish and berries! Get the
finest fish and berries in Haraway!

1:18:37.536 --> 1:18:40.340
Won't last long, I can guarantee you that.
