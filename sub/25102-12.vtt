WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:01.600
They took Lena.

00:01.819 --> 00:03.500
Who took her?

00:03.840 --> 00:05.240
DCFS.

00:05.300 --> 00:06.969
We'll get her back.

00:06.970 --> 00:09.080
I-I want to set up a
few holding companies.

00:09.100 --> 00:11.969
You know, a couple layers of papers,

00:11.970 --> 00:13.720
make it tough to track.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.770
I'm gonna have to report
this back to Smurf.

00:15.780 --> 00:16.790
No, you won't.

00:16.860 --> 00:18.060
Why not?

00:18.130 --> 00:20.160
Because you're smarter than that.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.329
You sicko bitch! You're done!

00:24.400 --> 00:25.770
Aah!

00:26.940 --> 00:29.220
- I hit Marco, man.
- Where's Pope?

00:29.260 --> 00:32.220
What happened to Marco was unfortunate.

00:32.340 --> 00:34.210
Where's my son, Lucy?

00:34.250 --> 00:35.300
You want Pope?

00:35.320 --> 00:38.400
Tell me you had Baz killed.

00:38.420 --> 00:40.980
I had Baz killed.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.040
I know you killed Baz.

You Charles?

02:05.970 --> 02:07.170
Robert?

02:07.240 --> 02:08.509
It's me.

02:08.570 --> 02:10.210
I got it right here.

02:16.830 --> 02:17.840
It's all in there.

02:17.850 --> 02:19.820
Okay. Thank you.

02:21.450 --> 02:22.720
Mix it in a drink.

02:22.790 --> 02:23.999
Doesn't taste like anything.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.120
Knocks 'em out,

02:25.190 --> 02:28.190
so make sure you say
your goodbyes first.

02:28.340 --> 02:31.560
When they're unconscious,
give 'em the helium.

02:31.620 --> 02:33.000
Use the exit bag.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.280
Make sure you pull this tight
to seal it, all right?

02:36.870 --> 02:39.940
No pain, right? I don't
want her to suffer.

02:40.010 --> 02:42.320
This is how we did it with my uncle.

02:42.340 --> 02:44.960
He was so sick by the
end he was begging.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.140
It's a good way to go.

02:47.150 --> 02:49.010
Dignified.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.360
You're giving your
mother a beautiful gift.

02:52.020 --> 02:54.000
How long does she have?

02:57.490 --> 02:59.280
Not sure.

02:59.340 --> 03:02.190
Hey. Hang in there, huh?

03:05.630 --> 03:06.899
Thanks.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.340
You're welcome.

03:35.660 --> 03:38.020
Good morning, my baby.

03:38.730 --> 03:40.420
Let me get you a plate.

04:06.360 --> 04:09.960
It might take me a while
to fence all that jewelry,

04:10.030 --> 04:12.960
but, uh, that's $10,000.

04:13.030 --> 04:15.770
Just so you know I'm keeping my word.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.820
I appreciate that, Smurf.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.310
Thank you.

04:22.370 --> 04:23.820
Have you seen Pope?

04:23.880 --> 04:26.440
Not since you brought
him back from Mexico.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.320
Well...

04:29.980 --> 04:34.260
if you happen to see him or talk to him,

04:34.520 --> 04:37.050
tell him I'm having a party today.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.900
Just neighbors and friends.

04:40.690 --> 04:41.700
A party?

04:41.760 --> 04:44.560
This family needs a little fun, huh?

04:45.340 --> 04:47.200
I'm down with some fun.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.400
Hey.

05:26.570 --> 05:28.080
Hey.

05:28.570 --> 05:30.110
Did you get any sleep?

05:30.180 --> 05:31.740
Barely.

05:33.020 --> 05:34.760
Want coffee?

05:35.020 --> 05:37.080
Yeah, thanks.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.649
You still a little sore?

05:40.050 --> 05:42.330
Yeah. Next time Smurf gives me a call,

05:42.340 --> 05:44.420
remind me to take a
sledgehammer to the phone.

05:46.260 --> 05:48.420
- She know you're upset?
- Yeah, she does.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.800
She's been trying to call
me the past three days.

05:51.740 --> 05:53.130
Hey.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.060
My family sucks, too.

05:55.070 --> 05:57.580
Your dad's kind of a dick
about you being gay.

05:59.270 --> 06:00.920
But my mom started a shootout

06:00.940 --> 06:03.260
with my dead brother's girlfriend, so...

06:03.360 --> 06:04.900
It's not a contest.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.020
Yeah, well, if it was, I'd win.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.129
Great.

07:03.130 --> 07:05.470
Well, we'll be here.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.840
You can deliver the food
any time before 2:00.

07:09.340 --> 07:10.920
Thank you.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.210
What's going on?

07:15.280 --> 07:17.280
I'm having a party.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.460
Let the neighborhood know I'm out.

07:20.700 --> 07:21.700
Great.

07:21.740 --> 07:24.150
You better be here by 3:00.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.920
- Sure.
- You hungry, baby?

07:25.960 --> 07:28.090
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

07:38.820 --> 07:40.240
What's this for?

07:40.310 --> 07:41.480
That's your cut.

07:41.770 --> 07:43.870
And when I fence the
rest of the jewelry,

07:43.880 --> 07:45.860
you will get an equal share.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.490
I'm not... I'm not sure

07:48.510 --> 07:50.690
the boys are gonna be happy about that.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.820
That's Baz's share.

07:53.180 --> 07:55.120
You're Baz's son.

07:55.190 --> 07:57.550
The money belongs to you.

08:00.660 --> 08:02.960
Have you seen Pope lately?

08:05.060 --> 08:07.460
No. Not in a couple of days. Why?

08:07.480 --> 08:09.160
No reason.

08:10.140 --> 08:12.220
Just be a little careful.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.600
Keep an eye out.

08:13.610 --> 08:15.960
You know how he gets when he's anxious.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.600
Okay.

08:19.410 --> 08:21.920
I'm gonna take a shower. I'll eat after.

08:23.620 --> 08:25.040
Oh, J.

08:25.750 --> 08:29.400
Um, I got a Quicken reminder
to pay the property tax

08:29.420 --> 08:31.610
on the land in Carlsbad,

08:31.640 --> 08:34.000
but I couldn't find the
check from the bill.

08:34.030 --> 08:35.580
Did you pay that already?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.620
I paid everything that came in.

08:37.659 --> 08:38.960
Hmm.

08:39.030 --> 08:41.000
Did you ask Morgan?

08:42.030 --> 08:43.700
I'm asking you.

08:43.770 --> 08:45.839
I left you in charge.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.740
Well, she wanted me to sign some
things a couple of weeks ago.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.239
Maybe the check was in there.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.160
You signed some things?

08:52.840 --> 08:56.000
Yeah. She said they
were coming from you.

08:56.380 --> 08:58.060
Should I not have?

08:58.850 --> 09:00.780
Go take your shower.

09:02.390 --> 09:03.900
I'll handle it.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.060
Okay.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.440
Where is Lena's stuff?

09:30.760 --> 09:32.980
I left you messages.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.160
Lena's coming home today.

09:39.420 --> 09:41.280
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.430
I pulled a few strings.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.020
She'll be here later this afternoon.

10:01.710 --> 10:03.510
I was just in time.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.580
That foster family was looking to adopt.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.190
What is all this?

10:11.260 --> 10:12.919
I had to sign an affidavit

10:12.920 --> 10:15.940
agreeing to be the primary guardian.

10:16.460 --> 10:19.300
You're not even supposed to
be alone in a room with her.

10:19.330 --> 10:20.600
That's bullshit.

10:20.610 --> 10:21.870
I know, baby,

10:21.930 --> 10:24.110
but they're never gonna
let you have her,

10:24.140 --> 10:26.600
not with your record.

10:26.610 --> 10:28.220
Aggravated battery,

10:28.280 --> 10:31.470
assault with a deadly
weapon, armed robbery...

10:31.510 --> 10:34.040
You just got out of jail.

10:35.210 --> 10:37.410
I wasn't convicted.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.960
I wasn't even indicted.

10:40.020 --> 10:43.150
I'll start the adoption
proceedings right away.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.759
Lena will live here, you move back in.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.980
You'll be with her every day.

10:49.490 --> 10:52.630
I just want us to be a family again.

11:00.570 --> 11:02.100
Hey.

11:02.770 --> 11:04.170
Where you been?

11:04.660 --> 11:06.510
Thought maybe you split.

11:06.580 --> 11:08.560
- Are you busy?
- No.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.780
What's this?

11:12.050 --> 11:13.399
Get dressed.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.060
We're gonna be late.

11:26.730 --> 11:29.199
Janine.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.599
How did you get in?

11:30.600 --> 11:32.680
Come have a glass of wine with me.

11:32.780 --> 11:34.340
It's 10:00 a.m.

11:34.410 --> 11:37.210
And I just spent three months in jail.

11:37.260 --> 11:40.480
Well, I'm gonna stick to
water. I should hydrate.

11:40.810 --> 11:42.920
Running, swimming.

11:42.980 --> 11:47.350
I'm glad my money affords you
so much time for fitness.

11:48.580 --> 11:50.280
Mm.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.260
How's home?

11:55.030 --> 11:57.380
I didn't think it would be this hard.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.700
Well, the boys will fall in line.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.900
Do you think I'm asking too much?

12:02.970 --> 12:05.960
Loyalty, trust.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.760
No.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.680
How much did you sell it for?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.580
What?

12:16.650 --> 12:20.500
The land I bought in Carlsbad in '08.

12:20.650 --> 12:23.320
That was your idea.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.440
I hope you got a good price.

12:25.990 --> 12:27.620
I've known you for 20 years.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.259
Do you think I'm stupid
enough to steal from you?

12:30.260 --> 12:32.510
You thought I was never getting out.

12:32.530 --> 12:36.220
I think you saw an
opportunity and you took it.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.069
Where is this coming from?

12:38.070 --> 12:41.200
I went by the county clerk's office.

12:41.270 --> 12:44.920
Private sale to a holding company.

12:44.940 --> 12:46.210
This is impossible.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.279
Now, the only question is,

12:48.280 --> 12:50.590
what else have you been skimming?

12:50.620 --> 12:52.250
You put a teenager in charge.

12:52.260 --> 12:54.180
Do you think J maybe made a mistake?

12:54.200 --> 12:58.489
I put J in charge because
he's a smart kid

12:58.490 --> 13:03.030
who doesn't know a damn
thing about real estate.

13:03.090 --> 13:06.300
Well, uh, he came to me last week

13:06.320 --> 13:08.400
and he was asking me
about buying properties

13:08.420 --> 13:09.690
and setting up holding companies,

13:09.700 --> 13:11.970
and I told him that if
he had any questions,

13:11.980 --> 13:13.170
he should go to you.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.180
Why didn't you come to me last week?

13:15.200 --> 13:17.110
I have been nothing but a friend to you.

13:17.140 --> 13:19.670
I don't have friends.

13:19.680 --> 13:23.310
Janine... there's some kind of mistake.

13:23.380 --> 13:24.899
I'm gonna look into it,

13:24.900 --> 13:26.719
and I'm gonna take care of it.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.640
I'm gonna make it right.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.960
You clean up good.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.150
You measure me when I was asleep?

13:59.200 --> 14:00.620
I have a good eye.

14:00.690 --> 14:02.880
- Get in.
- Nice car.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.120
Yours?

14:05.480 --> 14:07.600
I borrowed it.

14:07.620 --> 14:08.830
Hmm.

14:23.180 --> 14:24.310
Hey.

14:24.380 --> 14:25.940
Hey.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.160
Here's the key.

14:28.180 --> 14:29.640
It's gassed up, ready to go.

14:29.780 --> 14:30.850
Okay.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.500
You sounded freaked out over the phone.

14:32.520 --> 14:33.820
What's up?

14:34.320 --> 14:36.589
Has Pete told you anything
about Morgan Wilson?

14:36.590 --> 14:38.820
Mnh-mnh. No. Who is she?

14:39.190 --> 14:41.520
She's, uh... She's Smurf's lawyer.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.340
Smurf thinks she's skimming.

14:43.600 --> 14:44.880
Is she?

14:46.530 --> 14:47.820
And she left you in charge.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.460
Is that blowing back on you now?

14:50.140 --> 14:51.670
I don't know.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.470
She's cutting me out. She's
not telling me anything.

14:54.540 --> 14:57.740
Yeah, well, people like
that don't trust anybody.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.140
You know, you could just
split with some money

15:02.150 --> 15:04.410
and start over, right?

15:04.560 --> 15:07.050
What's stopping you from doing that?

15:10.980 --> 15:12.560
Thanks for this.

15:14.030 --> 15:15.380
Yeah.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.360
Still waiting on that apartment.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.540
I'll call you later.

15:55.130 --> 15:57.200
Jesus. Jesus.

15:57.270 --> 15:58.850
Come on. What the hell's wrong with you?

15:58.870 --> 16:00.360
Sorry, man.

16:01.540 --> 16:02.540
Here.

16:02.610 --> 16:03.900
It's for broken ribs.

16:03.920 --> 16:04.930
Thought you might want it.

16:04.940 --> 16:06.100
Thanks.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.279
Are you good on pain, man?

16:07.280 --> 16:08.679
I got some Percs from Craig.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.000
I'm fine.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.150
Okay.

16:16.220 --> 16:18.760
I haven't seen you since Mexico.

16:25.300 --> 16:27.720
Lena's coming home today.

16:27.740 --> 16:30.099
Really? That's good.

16:30.100 --> 16:32.970
Yeah. Smurf got her out.

16:33.040 --> 16:36.500
She's gonna... adopt her.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.120
Good.

16:38.140 --> 16:40.080
It's not good.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.780
How you doing, man? Are
you getting any sleep?

16:43.850 --> 16:45.320
I'm fine.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.319
I think you need something
to keep yourself busy

16:48.320 --> 16:50.050
in between jobs.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.320
Why?

16:51.390 --> 16:53.170
Because, man, you get weird

16:53.180 --> 16:55.020
when you don't have anything to do.

16:55.930 --> 16:57.299
Come on. You're good with cars.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.330
Maybe you get back in the shop,

16:58.340 --> 17:00.700
just a little side hustle or something.

17:01.470 --> 17:04.119
Or you come and, you know...

17:04.540 --> 17:06.960
work a couple nights at the bar a week.

17:07.270 --> 17:08.980
I'm good. Thanks, though.

17:09.210 --> 17:10.640
It keeps me sane.

17:11.339 --> 17:12.856
You know, having something that's mine.

17:12.880 --> 17:16.440
It's only yours because
Smurf lets you have it.

17:16.550 --> 17:18.549
I paid for it, okay? My
name's on the lease.

17:18.550 --> 17:20.749
And the second she decides
she doesn't like it,

17:20.750 --> 17:22.310
she's gonna find a way
to take it from you.

17:22.319 --> 17:24.950
I'm just as angry as you are
about what went down, man...

17:24.960 --> 17:26.979
but, I mean, what...

17:26.980 --> 17:28.089
what are we gonna do, man?

17:28.089 --> 17:29.500
What, are... are we gonna kill her?

17:57.200 --> 17:58.550
You know these people?

17:58.560 --> 18:00.559
Just follow my lead.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.500
Oh, excuse me.

18:14.570 --> 18:16.240
Ana. You made it.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.820
How are you?

18:17.830 --> 18:18.840
Good to see you.

18:18.910 --> 18:20.710
- This is Danny.
- Danny!

18:20.720 --> 18:21.979
My man.

18:21.980 --> 18:23.980
Hey. It is good to meet you.

18:24.050 --> 18:26.350
- Ana raves about you.
- Oh, yeah. Is that right?

18:26.380 --> 18:28.820
I hear you've been doing
work up in Palo Alto.

18:28.990 --> 18:30.620
Anyone I would know?

18:31.190 --> 18:33.189
Danny doesn't kiss and tell.

18:33.190 --> 18:34.700
All right, fair enough.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.040
I didn't want to get jealous anyway.

18:36.060 --> 18:38.380
Are you all packed and
ready for your big trip?

18:38.480 --> 18:40.980
Well, just about. It's a lot easier now

18:41.000 --> 18:42.599
knowing you'll be taking
care of the home front.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.199
Itinerary's all set, then?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.900
Yeah, you know, we got a week in Milan,

18:46.920 --> 18:49.010
two in Paris for Sophie,

18:49.070 --> 18:51.539
but then Cloudbreak, Dungeons,

18:51.540 --> 18:53.560
and J-Bay for this guy.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.280
Yeah, you surfing?

18:55.350 --> 18:57.480
Bro, where do you think this comes from?

18:57.500 --> 18:59.120
You hit Supertubes or no?

18:59.180 --> 19:01.950
Yeah, well, we try to get out
there maybe once a year, but...

19:02.020 --> 19:03.210
You guys come on outside.

19:03.220 --> 19:04.540
The chef has put together

19:04.550 --> 19:06.360
these little crab cake things.

19:06.420 --> 19:07.880
They'll blow your dick right off.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.060
Oh.

19:09.070 --> 19:10.990
- Yeah.
- Wow.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.480
When do you go?

19:32.540 --> 19:33.720
Tuesday.

19:33.790 --> 19:35.430
You talk to Farley? We all good?

19:35.450 --> 19:36.750
Yeah.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.120
Oh, uh, hold up. This
is way too heavy, man.

19:41.190 --> 19:43.220
Just pack it in the bag
with the rest of them.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.660
They don't know what your
boards weigh. Relax.

19:47.670 --> 19:49.400
You walk through the
airport looking like that,

19:49.420 --> 19:51.469
you're gonna end up in a back room.

19:51.470 --> 19:52.560
Try smiling.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.740
You just made a shitload of cash.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.670
Thanks.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.460
Baby, she'll be here in a minute.

20:23.970 --> 20:26.080
Who are all the people outside?

20:26.100 --> 20:28.840
We're having a welcome-home party.

20:29.510 --> 20:31.920
I just hired some people to help.

20:32.110 --> 20:34.450
Big bounce house gets here at 2:00.

20:34.460 --> 20:36.720
You know, she... she
likes her room at home.

20:36.740 --> 20:41.450
I had to buy her an entire new wardrobe.

20:41.520 --> 20:44.790
We can donate the things
that are still at Baz's.

20:44.860 --> 20:47.460
Kids grow out of clothes so fast.

20:47.530 --> 20:50.129
You have to do this
every couple of months.

20:50.130 --> 20:52.560
I've been doing fine with her.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.270
Have you, Andrew?

21:02.270 --> 21:05.240
She was taken from you.

21:07.280 --> 21:11.740
Now, we can't let that
happen again, ever.

21:12.550 --> 21:13.739
Come with me.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.740
I have something for you.

21:34.220 --> 21:35.639
There's a lot more

21:35.640 --> 21:37.750
when I fence the rest of the jewelry.

21:37.780 --> 21:38.780
I don't want it.

21:38.790 --> 21:40.020
It's yours.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.780
No.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.320
I know you miss your brother, baby.

22:02.620 --> 22:04.760
So do I.

22:04.820 --> 22:07.619
Baz always claimed he was...

22:07.620 --> 22:09.620
looking out for you.

22:12.610 --> 22:14.260
I never bought it.

22:15.350 --> 22:17.500
I think he wanted you weak.

22:17.620 --> 22:20.080
Made him feel strong.

22:20.150 --> 22:23.290
You boys were very competitive.

22:23.420 --> 22:25.600
He hated how much I loved you.

22:25.620 --> 22:26.720
Are you done?

22:28.230 --> 22:31.029
You're the man I always
knew you could be.

22:38.770 --> 22:40.570
That's her.

22:53.320 --> 22:54.580
Hey.

23:04.660 --> 23:06.900
The kitchen's completely redone.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.140
Brand-new dishwasher.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.099
Fridge, farm sink,

23:11.100 --> 23:13.280
and you're right off the ocean.

23:15.340 --> 23:18.070
You know, I think $1.4
million's a little steep

23:18.080 --> 23:19.410
for a two bedroom.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.590
You could Airbnb when you're away.

23:21.610 --> 23:23.590
$350 a night, $400 in the summer.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.860
Offset the cost of your mortgage.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.620
Might even turn a profit.

23:27.690 --> 23:30.820
Yeah. Then the L.A.
douchebags can come down

23:30.890 --> 23:32.360
and clog the lineup.

23:32.420 --> 23:33.690
That'd be a great idea.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.630
You're not from L.A.?

23:35.690 --> 23:37.290
No. I'm from here.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.700
Yo. Uh, there's a shower.

23:39.770 --> 23:41.560
Why don't I give you
some time to look around,

23:41.580 --> 23:42.760
then you can meet me outside?

23:42.780 --> 23:44.470
Thanks.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.740
I think this place has too much light.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.640
That's not a thing.

23:54.980 --> 23:56.880
I can't believe she
thought I was from L.A.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.040
It's a compliment.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.740
- How is that a compliment?
- Okay.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.419
You can always keep armpit showering out

24:02.420 --> 24:04.200
of the sink at your bar.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.690
Come here.

24:12.060 --> 24:13.379
Mm-hmm.

24:13.380 --> 24:15.160
Really good.

24:15.330 --> 24:18.480
Go change and I'll get
you a grilled cheese.

24:20.010 --> 24:21.880
Would you like one?

24:25.210 --> 24:28.400
She hates that fancy new school.

24:28.460 --> 24:29.940
No, she doesn't.

24:30.350 --> 24:31.899
They suspended her.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.149
You didn't tell me that.

24:33.150 --> 24:35.080
It's the best school in the county.

24:38.360 --> 24:41.020
I don't know what kind of
people suspend a child

24:41.090 --> 24:43.830
who lost both her parents.

24:43.900 --> 24:47.360
She's a very smart girl.

24:47.430 --> 24:50.820
I could always home
school her like I did you.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.970
I have to go out for a bit.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.440
Can you watch her?

24:58.510 --> 25:00.110
I've been watching her.

25:00.180 --> 25:01.780
Of course you have.

25:03.720 --> 25:06.720
You can make a grilled
cheese, can't you?

25:24.200 --> 25:26.360
Everything's pink.

25:29.140 --> 25:31.460
You don't like pink?

25:37.550 --> 25:40.420
Grab your backpack.
We're going somewhere.

26:23.260 --> 26:24.990
Get in.

26:25.060 --> 26:26.460
What?

26:27.260 --> 26:29.930
Get in or I'll run you over.

26:40.380 --> 26:43.580
Where are we going?!

26:44.780 --> 26:46.720
Josh!

26:46.790 --> 26:49.260
Is Uncle Pope gonna be
waiting at the docks?

26:52.060 --> 26:53.790
Call Smurf!

26:53.860 --> 26:56.620
Let me talk to her.
We can work this out.

26:59.130 --> 27:01.400
Where are we going?!

27:01.470 --> 27:04.070
She's playing you, J!

27:17.740 --> 27:19.550
Ah, let's see.

27:19.620 --> 27:22.710
You, big guy, will be
handling recessed lighting

27:22.720 --> 27:25.000
in the kitchen and the living room.

27:25.020 --> 27:27.800
I want a whole new system
upstairs in the bedrooms.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.080
Oh, and spotlights on the artwork

27:30.100 --> 27:32.220
on the first and the second
floor, but enough about that.

27:32.230 --> 27:34.300
Come here for a second.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.680
All right.

27:37.500 --> 27:38.540
What do you think?

27:38.840 --> 27:40.770
I just bought it, so...

27:40.840 --> 27:43.770
I... I mean, is it too
big for the space?

27:43.980 --> 27:46.760
No, no. It's perfect.

27:47.380 --> 27:49.490
Yeah, yeah, it's... it's cool.

27:49.510 --> 27:51.400
I love these saturated colors.

27:51.460 --> 27:54.110
The brush strokes, I mean, they...
they give it so much texture.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.700
I love the tension in the piece.

27:55.720 --> 27:58.040
It's, uh, suspenseful.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.990
Suspenseful.

28:00.060 --> 28:01.880
The colors don't bleed.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.530
They're in opposition to one another,

28:03.540 --> 28:06.520
almost like they're fighting
for space on the canvas.

28:08.530 --> 28:09.730
What do you think, Danny?

28:11.200 --> 28:12.339
Uh...

28:12.340 --> 28:13.939
Oh, Danny.

28:13.940 --> 28:17.340
Danny does not love modern art,

28:17.540 --> 28:19.680
but, uh, don't hold that against him.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.900
Oh, yeah? Who's your guy?

28:21.940 --> 28:23.480
Rembrandt, right?

28:23.550 --> 28:26.149
He loves those Dutch masters.

28:26.150 --> 28:27.700
That's right, yeah.

28:28.890 --> 28:30.420
So, Danny, you're not an Aussie.

28:30.490 --> 28:32.200
Where are you originally from?

28:32.220 --> 28:33.419
Oh, North Shore.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.959
He grew up on the North Shore.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.659
- Right?
- That's right, yeah.

28:36.660 --> 28:38.159
Right on. So you surf?

28:38.160 --> 28:39.759
Since before I could walk.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.410
I'll have to get you some swag, then.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.170
- Hmm.
- You a fan of my surf line?

28:43.240 --> 28:45.140
Of course. Who isn't?

28:45.160 --> 28:46.759
Hey, good answer, buddy.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.169
Give me just a minute.

28:48.170 --> 28:49.569
I'll go down and show him something

28:49.570 --> 28:51.370
from our new collection.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.760
You're an extra large, right?

28:54.420 --> 28:55.659
- You got me.
- Yeah, buddy.

28:55.660 --> 28:57.180
That's so nice.

29:02.620 --> 29:03.989
Rembrandt?

29:03.990 --> 29:07.060
You're doing great. Collin loves you.

29:07.140 --> 29:10.420
Collin Francis from, uh, SurfGlo, right?

29:10.430 --> 29:11.440
Yeah, you know him?

29:11.450 --> 29:13.930
Dude makes $100 hemp
necklaces for kooks.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.220
Surprised he's not wearing
a rash guard right now.

29:16.320 --> 29:19.070
Well, he's worth $500 million.

29:19.140 --> 29:21.200
Well, he's still a douche.

29:21.440 --> 29:24.340
And you know it's a bitch to
fence all this artwork, right?

29:24.460 --> 29:27.540
Feds are all over it. You got
to find a private buyer.

29:27.610 --> 29:28.880
It takes forever.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.920
Who said anything about stealing art?

29:40.490 --> 29:42.740
I took Nina Bear from Grandma Smurf's,

29:42.760 --> 29:45.229
but if there's anything you
want out of your closet,

29:45.230 --> 29:47.160
you should take it now.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.630
Why are we running away?

29:53.170 --> 29:56.100
We're not. We're just...
We're just taking a trip.

29:57.240 --> 29:58.950
Where are we gonna live?

29:58.980 --> 30:00.720
Someplace great.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.080
Where would I go to school?

30:05.120 --> 30:06.960
We'll figure it out when we get there.

30:06.990 --> 30:09.059
Me and Bella had bunk beds

30:09.060 --> 30:10.900
and a trampoline.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.300
Bella?

30:13.880 --> 30:16.030
The foster family.

30:17.730 --> 30:19.480
You liked them, huh?

30:20.400 --> 30:22.700
We were gonna be sisters.

30:24.470 --> 30:27.200
You have a family. I'm your family.

30:27.270 --> 30:29.400
But I make you sad.

30:31.460 --> 30:33.800
What are you talking about? I'm not sad.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.380
You're always sad.

30:57.900 --> 31:00.680
Don't you have employees for that?

31:02.800 --> 31:04.920
What do you want?

31:06.450 --> 31:08.380
Word is bond, son.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.360
- Word is bond.
- Mm.

31:20.400 --> 31:23.300
How long are you gonna
keep punishing me, Deran?

31:27.270 --> 31:30.000
Maybe till you stop dragging
me into all your bullshit.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.480
I'm worried about Pope.

31:40.500 --> 31:43.980
I'm thinking Lucy got into
his head down in Mexico.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.180
He isn't sleeping.

31:47.090 --> 31:49.120
You heard anything from him?

31:51.960 --> 31:53.470
He's got that look he gets,

31:53.490 --> 31:56.800
that... that somewhere-else look.

32:01.340 --> 32:04.000
He hasn't spoken to me in...

32:06.100 --> 32:07.980
long time.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.640
Long time.

32:13.980 --> 32:16.040
What do you want me to do about it?

32:16.920 --> 32:19.760
Pope needs his family around him now.

32:20.020 --> 32:22.770
I'm having a little
welcome-home party for Lena

32:22.790 --> 32:25.270
in about an hour at the house.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.700
No big deal.

32:27.330 --> 32:29.130
I hope you stop by.

32:55.820 --> 32:58.619
Smurf doesn't know that
we're here, does she?

32:58.620 --> 33:00.060
Are you framing me, J?

33:01.560 --> 33:03.120
You need me.

33:03.180 --> 33:05.320
I can help you cover your tracks.

33:05.380 --> 33:07.110
How many steps did you take

33:07.120 --> 33:09.350
to establish the holding company? One?

33:09.360 --> 33:11.179
Smurf's got a lot of
friends in this town.

33:11.180 --> 33:13.439
Not gonna take her long to
figure out what happened.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.310
What will she do to you then?

33:19.840 --> 33:22.380
It's a 10-mile swim to shore.

33:22.450 --> 33:24.050
Get up.

33:24.120 --> 33:26.100
You want to be able to use your hands.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.720
- Get up!
- No!

33:27.790 --> 33:29.990
Stand up!

33:30.050 --> 33:31.090
Aah.

33:33.130 --> 33:34.840
Oh!

33:36.060 --> 33:37.130
Aah!

33:39.720 --> 33:41.200
Come here!

33:49.300 --> 33:52.380
J! J, please don't leave me here!

33:53.460 --> 33:55.380
J, I can help you!

34:00.490 --> 34:01.960
J!

34:03.160 --> 34:04.550
J!

34:04.880 --> 34:06.960
J!

34:19.540 --> 34:22.380
And while we're away, I
expect all you degenerates

34:22.400 --> 34:23.799
to buy enough of the new collection

34:23.800 --> 34:25.639
to keep our stock price up.

34:25.710 --> 34:29.080
I'll be sure to post all of
the pictures on Instagram

34:29.120 --> 34:31.380
of Sophie in a shark cage.

34:31.449 --> 34:32.980
Um, definitely not.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.989
She's more adventurous than she looks.

34:36.050 --> 34:39.199
As I was saying, guys,
here's to SurfGlo, huh?

34:39.219 --> 34:40.520
Where are we going?

34:40.590 --> 34:42.159
You'll see.

34:44.330 --> 34:46.659
Thank you, guys, for everything you do,

34:46.730 --> 34:49.400
what you've done, what we're
gonna do in the future.

34:49.469 --> 34:50.800
Appreciate it.

35:25.840 --> 35:29.510
So, uh... what's with the accent?

35:29.570 --> 35:30.940
You like it?

35:31.580 --> 35:33.440
Maybe.

35:33.510 --> 35:34.710
You ever been there?

35:34.780 --> 35:36.650
Australia? No.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.220
Is it nice?

35:38.280 --> 35:39.780
Wouldn't know.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.340
What is wrong with rich people?

35:45.040 --> 35:47.120
Money's a drug.

35:47.190 --> 35:50.390
You run out of things to buy,
you start collecting shit.

35:50.460 --> 35:52.680
How'd you know all the stuff about art?

35:53.800 --> 35:55.700
My dad was into it.

35:56.740 --> 35:58.540
The van hippie, your dad?

35:58.600 --> 35:59.999
He knew about all this art?

36:00.000 --> 36:03.540
We had a painting when I was growing up.

36:03.550 --> 36:07.720
It was, um, this little
sailboat on a stormy sea.

36:07.820 --> 36:11.020
It was the only seascape
Rembrandt ever painted.

36:11.380 --> 36:14.540
Was stolen from a museum
in Boston in 1990.

36:14.580 --> 36:16.250
The van hippie was an art thief?

36:18.160 --> 36:21.690
It was worth millions,
but he never sold it.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.290
Loved it too much to let it go.

36:24.360 --> 36:26.100
So where is it now?

36:26.360 --> 36:29.340
I don't know. Wherever he is, I guess.

36:30.300 --> 36:31.960
Mm.

36:33.110 --> 36:34.700
So, how much is all this worth?

36:36.640 --> 36:39.980
300, 400 grand.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.950
Maybe more.

36:47.720 --> 36:50.040
It's a better target than the art.

36:51.060 --> 36:52.490
Could fence this.

36:55.860 --> 36:58.500
Smurf has you thinking small.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.000
Oh, yeah?

37:01.070 --> 37:02.600
Is that what you think?

37:03.020 --> 37:05.000
You don't need a gun.

37:05.470 --> 37:07.260
You don't need to break a window.

37:07.870 --> 37:11.600
You just need someone who
trusts you to open the door.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.010
Where are you, baby?

37:18.080 --> 37:20.420
The party started an hour ago.

37:20.490 --> 37:23.260
People are here looking for Lena.

37:23.820 --> 37:25.820
Call me back.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.079
Thank you.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.769
I'm gonna go talk to her.

37:35.770 --> 37:37.300
Okay.

37:40.510 --> 37:43.460
Bella, can I talk to Lena for a second?

37:44.300 --> 37:45.700
Thanks.

37:56.590 --> 37:58.380
They seem nice.

37:58.860 --> 38:00.420
Mm-hmm.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.720
When I was your age,

38:13.540 --> 38:15.940
I'd get angry all the time... you know?

38:17.140 --> 38:18.719
Kids thought it was funny,

38:18.720 --> 38:20.819
so they'd steal my things
and push me around.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.480
I was kind of small.

38:27.090 --> 38:30.540
So I'd get angry and...
and hit somebody.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.080
Teachers would get mad.

38:34.690 --> 38:37.360
You know, they never saw
what the other kids did.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.780
Everybody thought I was...

38:48.510 --> 38:49.969
terrible,

38:49.970 --> 38:51.090
even Smurf.

38:55.580 --> 38:58.940
I guess maybe I was pretty awful.

39:09.660 --> 39:12.800
The only person that was
nice to me was my sister.

39:17.870 --> 39:19.780
Your dad was the second.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.110
And then your mom.

39:29.610 --> 39:31.550
I promised them I was
gonna take care of you

39:31.560 --> 39:33.390
and I'm gonna do that, okay?

39:45.360 --> 39:47.560
Can I have a hug?

39:59.660 --> 40:01.640
_

40:34.950 --> 40:36.700
What is this place?

40:37.220 --> 40:38.620
I bought it.

40:39.350 --> 40:40.930
You can stay here if you'd like.

40:40.950 --> 40:42.860
Damn, daddy!

40:43.090 --> 40:44.800
Okay.

40:45.690 --> 40:48.470
I mean, I would've just taken

40:48.480 --> 40:51.100
some $100-a-month shithole, but...

40:53.030 --> 40:55.010
Are you gonna stay here, too?

40:55.030 --> 40:56.640
No, not yet.

40:57.500 --> 41:00.240
You make that much
money off your last job?

41:02.040 --> 41:03.620
Mm.

41:03.740 --> 41:05.440
Come on. Where's it from?

41:07.250 --> 41:09.300
What happened to your face?

41:12.320 --> 41:15.220
Okay. So, is this all just to get me

41:15.240 --> 41:16.850
to keep an eye out on Pete?

41:16.860 --> 41:18.020
'Cause I'm not a hooker.

41:18.660 --> 41:19.860
No.

41:19.920 --> 41:21.859
No, I just...

41:21.860 --> 41:23.729
I-I just need someone outside the family

41:23.730 --> 41:25.230
I can trust right now.

41:27.330 --> 41:28.920
You trust me?

41:29.730 --> 41:31.480
You're my best option.

41:51.140 --> 41:53.259
Where is Lena?

41:53.260 --> 41:55.820
I gave her back to the foster family.

41:56.380 --> 41:57.600
What?

41:57.620 --> 41:58.960
They're gonna adopt her,

41:59.030 --> 42:02.330
- and you are gonna let them.
- The hell I am.

42:02.370 --> 42:03.370
As long as she's there,

42:03.371 --> 42:04.840
I won't tell the others

42:04.850 --> 42:06.500
that you had Baz killed.

42:08.300 --> 42:09.840
What?

42:11.310 --> 42:14.360
Baby, I think you're confused again.

42:15.380 --> 42:17.879
You know how when you get
an idea in your head

42:17.880 --> 42:22.620
and you obsess on it over and over?

42:23.320 --> 42:26.490
We're all starting to
get worried about you.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.990
Anyway, what's to stop me from
getting in my car right now

42:33.000 --> 42:34.170
and going to get Lena?

42:34.180 --> 42:35.420
You don't go near her.

42:35.500 --> 42:37.130
Or what, Andrew?

42:37.200 --> 42:38.720
Or what?

42:39.400 --> 42:41.580
Are you gonna hurt me?

42:42.410 --> 42:44.720
You gonna kill me?

42:45.610 --> 42:48.900
You think your brothers
would ever forgive you?

42:50.580 --> 42:53.950
I want you here at home with me

42:53.980 --> 42:56.160
where I can look after you.

43:02.940 --> 43:04.820
What about Lena?

43:05.230 --> 43:08.260
I'll forget she ever existed.

43:15.480 --> 43:16.770
Good.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.619
Now, you pull yourself together

43:18.620 --> 43:20.610
and come join the party.

43:37.700 --> 43:40.000
Hey, baby.

43:40.070 --> 43:41.400
Hey.

43:41.470 --> 43:43.200
Where you been?

43:43.220 --> 43:44.879
Oh, some friends were back from college.

43:44.880 --> 43:46.120
We were hanging out,

43:46.140 --> 43:47.860
lost track of time. I'm sorry.

43:48.010 --> 43:49.870
College, huh?

43:53.350 --> 43:54.850
What happened there?

43:54.880 --> 43:56.730
Yeah, I... We were messing around.

43:56.740 --> 43:58.910
I tripped and hit my face
on the coffee table.

43:58.920 --> 44:01.280
Stupid shit. Is it bleeding?

44:01.350 --> 44:04.640
Sometimes I forget how
young you really are.

44:07.890 --> 44:09.150
J.

44:09.200 --> 44:13.500
I've been calling Morgan all afternoon.

44:13.820 --> 44:15.700
No one answers.

44:16.640 --> 44:19.020
Do you think maybe she skipped town?

44:19.100 --> 44:20.960
Maybe.

44:22.440 --> 44:24.709
What are you gonna do?

44:24.710 --> 44:30.160
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go over
the books line by line.

44:31.120 --> 44:35.200
If she took something
else, I'll find it.

44:36.120 --> 44:38.060
Go get a drink, baby.
