11:48.542 --> 11:53.278
hole that has the potential...
>> Gumball: Psst! Miss simian!
>> Huh?

11:53.280 --> 11:58.917
You're nothing but a pair of
disruptive, disrespectful
delinquents from a dysfunctional

11:58.919 --> 12:01.920
dynasty of degenerates and
dimwits!
>> What have you got to say in

12:01.922 --> 12:04.556
your defense?
>> Gumball: Uh, it -- it was an
accident, sir.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.991
We were trying to tell her
something.
>> Tell her what?!

12:06.993 --> 12:10.695
>> Gumball: Uh, i-i...
I can't say it.
It's too embarrassing.

12:10.697 --> 12:14.499
>> For the last time, why did
you throw a paper plane in your
teacher's face?

12:14.501 --> 12:18.303
>> Darwin: It says it all on the
paper.
>> "You do not know how much you

12:18.305 --> 12:21.606
show, but the wind doth blow in
the hills below."
Huh?

12:21.608 --> 12:31.049
>> Speaking of which, can anyone
else feel that draft?
>> [ Spitting ]

12:38.390 --> 12:45.130
[ Spitting ]
>> Darwin: Maybe you should say
something.

12:45.132 --> 12:49.968
>> Yes, i suppose.
[ Whispering indistinctly ]
>> [ Gasps ]

12:49.970 --> 12:55.240
You knew about this, and you
thought it was funny, didn't
you?!

12:55.242 --> 12:59.544
You think this is funny?!
>> Lucy, please, i think you owe
them an apology.

12:59.546 --> 13:04.349
>> don't you "Lucy" me, Nigel!
These kids tried to make a
monkey out of me, and you want

13:04.351 --> 13:08.987
me to apologize?!
>> Uh, you kids are free to go.
[ Door opens, closes ]

[ Shrieking ]

13:17.396 --> 13:20.331
[ Breathing heavily ]
[ Shrieking ]
>> Gumball: Hmm, there's one

13:20.333 --> 13:24.135
thing i don't understand.
>> Darwin: Yeah, why did she go
ape when we just tried to help

13:24.137 --> 13:26.571
her?
>> Gumball: No.
Why do monkey have hair all over

13:26.573 --> 13:29.574
their bodies except for the ugly
part where they need it the
most?

13:29.576 --> 13:33.178
[ Bell rings ]
Have you noticed that
miss simian's been acting a

13:33.180 --> 13:37.382
little off lately?
>> Darwin: Now that you mention
it, she has been keeping a

13:37.384 --> 13:39.751
particularly close eye on us.

13:45.157 --> 13:52.197
[ Tap! ]
[ Smack! ]
>> Report card<i> signed.</i>

13:52.199 --> 14:03.341
>> Gumball: Oh, okay.
>> [ Laughing ]
[ Laughter ]

14:08.814 --> 14:13.084
[ Laughter stops ]
It's the most pathetic,
half-baked attempt at forgery

14:13.086 --> 14:17.822
I've seen in my 300,000 years as
a teacher, and i taught during
the stone age!

14:17.824 --> 14:21.659
>> Dad: [ Gasps ]
Forgeriers?!
My own flesh and blood accused

14:21.661 --> 14:25.330
of forgerering?!
What does it mean?
>> Faking your signature.

14:25.332 --> 14:28.466
>> Dad: [ Gasps ]
>> We need you to sign their
suspension card.

14:28.468 --> 14:35.306
>> Gumball: [ Sputters ]
>> Dad: Buh, buh, buh.
Mm.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.676
>> [ Crying ]
>> Uh, listen, these kids are
decent children.

14:38.678 --> 14:42.046
There's nothing you can suspend
them for.
They don't fight.

14:42.048 --> 14:48.653
They respect school property.
They don't steal.
[ Both shouting ]

14:48.655 --> 14:51.155
>> Come on, pick it up and keep
it for themselves, you thieving
hoodlums!

14:51.157 --> 14:53.892
>> Gumball: We're rich!
>> Darwin: We're prosperous!
>> Gumball: We're opulent!

14:53.894 --> 14:56.561
>> Darwin: We're flushed!
>> Gumball: We're gilded!
>> Darwin: We're wealthy!

14:56.563 --> 14:58.897
>> Gumball: We're -- wait a
minute.
We need to change our phone

14:58.899 --> 15:01.366
numbers and leave town.
>> Darwin: Why?
>> Gumball: Because they're all

15:01.368 --> 15:03.668
gonna want a piece of it.
>> Darwin: Who?
>> Gumball: Everyone!

15:03.670 --> 15:06.905
Look at them all trying to get
their creepy hands on my money!
>> Darwin: Gumball, you've

15:06.907 --> 15:09.774
changed.
>> Gumball: No, i haven't!
I'm just the same but happier

15:09.776 --> 15:13.144
because I'm rich!
>> Darwin: Look at yourself!
You're surrounded by all these

15:13.146 --> 15:17.949
riches, and you're the loneliest
man in the world!
[ Crying ]

15:17.951 --> 15:21.452
>> Gumball: You're -- you're
right!
This money<i> is</i> evil!

15:21.454 --> 15:28.726
I wish I'd never found it!
[ Thud ]
Mm, have you heard?

15:28.728 --> 15:32.363
There's gonna be a big fight.
>> Darwin: Why do you think i
brought the popcorn?

15:32.365 --> 15:35.300
Who do you think it'll be?
>> Gumball: I don't know.
[ Gasps ]

15:35.302 --> 15:44.909
Imagine if it's Tina and bobert!
>> [ Roaring ]
If i saw that, i would throw

15:44.911 --> 15:48.212
away my eyes because nothing
else in the world would be worth
watching anymore.

15:48.214 --> 15:56.421
>> Darwin: Really?
What about [Sniffs] Alan versus
Willy?!

15:56.423 --> 15:59.424
[ Bump! ]
[ Bump! ]
>> Gumball: Yeah, I'd watch it,

15:59.426 --> 16:02.026
but it'd be better if they were
in a cage.
>> Darwin: With spikes.

16:02.028 --> 16:06.764
>> Gumball: That was on fire.
[ Bumping ]
Oh, i can't wait to see who it

16:06.766 --> 16:11.436
is!
>> All: Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

16:11.438 --> 16:15.940
>> See, look at them, about to
fight like animals.
>> Why not focus your attention

16:15.942 --> 16:20.011
on someone who really needs it?
[ Sloop! ]
>> Hush! It's about to start.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.647
>> All: Fight! Fight! Fight!
>> Gumball: Dude, what are we
doing?

16:22.649 --> 16:25.750
>> Darwin: Stupid things because
of peer pressure!
>> This would be better with

16:25.752 --> 16:28.252
poisoned nunchucks.
>> Darwin: You got to get us out
of this!

16:28.254 --> 16:32.056
>> Gumball: Okay, hold on, i got
it.
People of elmore, you came to

16:32.058 --> 16:36.561
see a fight, and until a few
seconds ago, i was just like
you!

16:36.563 --> 16:41.366
But now, knowing I'm the one
supposed to get hit, I've
discovered something!

16:41.368 --> 16:47.071
Fighting is wrong!
This is no way to settle a
dispute because after all, what

16:47.073 --> 16:57.582
is more powerful -- this or
<i>this?!</i>
>> [ Clapping ]

16:57.584 --> 17:03.388
[ Applause ]
[ Pounding on glass ]
>> Lucy, what's wrong? Speak!

17:03.390 --> 17:06.691
>> [ Sobs ]
This isn't at all what i had
planned!

17:06.693 --> 17:12.597
>> Please don't tell me you're
the one who arranged this fight.
[ Sighs ]

17:12.599 --> 17:18.803
>> [ Shrieking ]
>> [ Sighs ]
>> [ Sighs ]

17:18.805 --> 17:22.673
I know we haven't spoken in a
long time, but i need your
advice.

17:22.675 --> 17:28.479
Is it really wrong to create
false evidence to frame some
criminals who you know for sure

17:28.481 --> 17:35.720
are definitely, absolutely,
without a single shadow of a
doubt guilty?!

17:35.722 --> 17:42.093
Well, i don't care what you say,
dad!
I'm doing it anyway!

17:42.095 --> 17:49.667
Mm. [ Laughs evilly ]
[ Humming ]
Aha!

17:49.669 --> 17:54.872
Let's see you get away with<i> this</i>
one, you little hooligans!
And i know for sure that these

17:54.874 --> 17:59.610
two did the graffiti because
they were idiotic enough to sign
their names at the bottom of it!

17:59.612 --> 18:02.814
>> Are you sure no one else
could've done it?
>> Absolutely!

18:02.816 --> 18:07.318
>> Miss simian, wrongly accusing
the boys is one thing, but
openly framing them is another!

18:07.320 --> 18:10.655
One more offense, and you are
fired!
And you still owe these boys an

18:10.657 --> 18:13.224
apology.
>> Gumball: That's fine, that's
fine.

18:13.226 --> 18:17.428
>> I'll apologize when fish
start to walk.
>> Darwin: [ Inhales ]

18:17.430 --> 18:22.467
>> If this really is the kind of
person you are, then we
seriously need to talk about our

18:22.469 --> 18:27.472
relationship, as well.
>> [ Shrieking ]
>> I saw that coming.

18:27.474 --> 18:31.642
I glued everything to the floor.
>> [ Crying ]
[ Door opens, closes ]

18:31.644 --> 18:37.081
>> [ Crying ]
>> Darwin: I got to be honest,
gumball.

18:37.083 --> 18:40.952
I'm not entirely comfortable
committing a crime.
>> Gumball: Look, it's not a

18:40.954 --> 18:44.388
crime if you intend to get
caught.
Unless we actually do something

18:44.390 --> 18:48.993
bad, simian's gonna blow a fuse
and lose her hairy boyfriend.
Do you really want that on your

18:48.995 --> 18:55.299
conscience?
Good, then give me a leg up.
>> Darwin: Now what am i

18:55.301 --> 18:57.702
supposed to do?!
>> Gumball: Give yourself a leg
up!

18:57.704 --> 19:02.740
>> Darwin: Oh, of course.
>> [ Crying ]

19:07.112 --> 19:16.921
Oh! [ Crying ]
>> Gumball: [ Grunting ]
Oh!

19:16.923 --> 19:23.561
>> Darwin: [ Inhales ]
>> Gumball: don't!
[ Laughs ]

19:23.563 --> 19:29.333
This is gonna be easier than i
thought.
[ Feet squeak ]

19:29.335 --> 19:34.038
>> [ Shrieking ]
>> Gumball: Oh, why do i have to
run every eight minutes of my

19:34.040 --> 19:36.407
life?!
>> Darwin: Wait!
In the jungle when a gorilla

19:36.409 --> 19:41.746
charges, you have to stare them
to the ground!
>> [ Shrieking ]

19:41.748 --> 19:44.849
>> Gumball: Oh, is it working,
dude?
Dude?

19:44.851 --> 19:48.719
>> Darwin: I just realized, we
can't let her catch us until
we've done something bad!

19:48.721 --> 19:51.789
>> Gumball: Oh, you could've
told me!
>> Darwin: Sorry!

19:51.791 --> 19:55.593
>> [ Shrieking ]
>> Gumball: Aah!
[ Shouting indistinctly ]

19:55.595 --> 20:02.600
>> [ Shrieks ]
[ Shrieking ]
>> Gumball: Aah!

20:02.602 --> 20:07.905
>> [ Shrieking continues ]
>> Darwin: Quick, get in here!
[ Bong! ]

20:13.445 --> 20:17.582
>> Gumball: Okay, you get
brown's attention.
I'll deface his car.

20:17.584 --> 20:21.252
>> Darwin: Psst!
Principal brown!
Principal brown!

20:21.254 --> 20:25.823
Principal brown!
Principal brown!
Principal brown!

20:25.825 --> 20:29.460
>> Gumball: [ Gasps ]
Dude, why is every single window
broken except for brown's?!

20:29.462 --> 20:34.999
>> Darwin: How about you do it
yourself if you're such a hot
shot?

20:35.001 --> 20:43.407
>> I caught them!
I finally caught them, which
means i can do this.

20:43.409 --> 20:49.013
You're coming with me to the
principal's office.
>> Gumball: With pleasure.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.449
Wait, we forgot to spray our
names.
>> What do you mean?

20:51.451 --> 20:54.418
>> Gumball: Duh.
If we don't sign it,
principal brown will think it's

20:54.420 --> 20:58.422
you again, then you'll get fired
and lose the love of your life.
Now, where would that leave us?

20:58.424 --> 21:01.926
>> Are you trying to say that
you only did this to save my
reputation, my job, and my

21:01.928 --> 21:04.829
relationship?
>> Darwin: Of course.
What do you take us for -- some

21:04.831 --> 21:09.634
kind of criminals?
>> Well, yes.
[ Gasps ] And i was wrong!

21:09.636 --> 21:12.637
Right, I'll clean this up.
You need to get out of here
before principal brown sees

21:12.639 --> 21:14.505
this.
>> Gumball: I don't think so,
miss simian.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.941
We're not letting you ruin your
life.
>> don't worry -- i won't.

21:16.943 --> 21:24.882
Just go!
Boys!
I'm sorry!

21:24.884 --> 21:29.420
>> Gumball: What?
>> I'm sorry!
>> Gumball: Say again?

21:29.422 --> 21:32.823
>> I'm sorry!
>> Gumball: Ha, heard it the
first time, miss.

21:32.825 --> 21:39.764
Just wanted to milk it.
>> [ Laughs ]
Why, those little [Laughs]

21:39.766 --> 21:44.602
>> Care to explain?
>> Well... [ sighs ]
