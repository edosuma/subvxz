WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.747
What's new at school?

00:03.836 --> 00:05.373
- Nothing.
- Nothing!

00:05.464 --> 00:07.375
Oh, uh, one
of the lunch ladies died.

00:07.466 --> 00:09.377
They found her in the gym with,
like, two holes in her neck

00:09.468 --> 00:11.129
and all the blood drained
out of her.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.961
Good lord! Who does
something like that?

00:13.055 --> 00:15.422
Obviously a vampire.
W-W-Where's the pepper?

00:15.516 --> 00:17.257
Wait, what?!
Vampires are real?!

00:17.351 --> 00:20.218
Yes, Summer, vampires
are real. Who knew?

00:20.312 --> 00:22.974
Oh, right, all humanity,
for hundreds of years, now.

00:23.065 --> 00:24.351
Yeah, Summer,
it's a big universe.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.273
Get used to it.
R-Right, Rick?

00:26.360 --> 00:27.521
Well, what are we
going to do?!

00:27.611 --> 00:29.522
We're gonna live our lives
until we die.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.524
Possibly by vampire.
More likely auto accident

00:31.615 --> 00:34.152
or heart disease,
but possibly vampire.

00:34.243 --> 00:37.156
Grandpa Rick, couldn't you,
like, use your superknowledge

00:37.246 --> 00:39.988
to turn yourself into a teenager
and come to our school

00:40.082 --> 00:42.540
and help us hunt
the vampire down?

00:42.626 --> 00:44.208
Um -- Wow.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.535
Yeah, pretty specific
pitch, Summer.

00:46.630 --> 00:49.372
I probably <i>could</i>
turn myself into a teenager

00:49.466 --> 00:52.254
and hang out in the
zit-covered, hormone-addled,

00:52.344 --> 00:54.301
low-stakes assworld
that is high school.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.004
But here's my reverse-ask --

00:56.098 --> 00:58.806
Why in the fuck
would I ever do that, ever?

00:58.892 --> 01:01.099
And how dare you even
ask me that?

01:01.186 --> 01:02.972
And why aren't you more
ashamed of yourself?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.179
- Dad!
- Be ashamed of yourself, sweetie.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.060
Jerry! Do you know what you
just said to our daughter?

01:07.150 --> 01:09.107
Sor-ry! I wasn't
paying attention.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.561
To a conversation
about vampires?!

01:11.655 --> 01:14.238
Clearly, I didn't know
it was about vampires,

01:14.324 --> 01:16.065
because I wasn't
paying attention,

01:16.159 --> 01:17.570
which you would know,

01:17.661 --> 01:19.402
if you ever
paid attention to me!

01:19.496 --> 01:21.407
Oh, here we go,
right to the victim role.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.080
Am I a victim, Beth,

01:23.166 --> 01:24.873
or am I married
to a mean, unfair monster

01:24.960 --> 01:26.166
that always hurts me?!

01:26.253 --> 01:28.164
Jesus Christ!
Will you fix your marriage...

01:28.255 --> 01:31.247
or get a divorce already?

01:31.341 --> 01:35.335
Well, we tried
a couples' therapist.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.965
That's Earth therapy.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.671
You might as well ask a horse
to fix a merry-go-round.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.723
I mean, he'll try his best, but mostly,
he's just gonna get horrified.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.594
I know about a place off-planet
with a 100% success rate.

01:44.688 --> 01:47.146
Well, we want to make it
work, if we can.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.597
- It's just --
- Then it's settled.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.103
- No need to pack.
- Oh!

01:50.193 --> 01:51.604
Let's go, go, go, go!

01:51.695 --> 01:54.687
Do you think Mom and Dad
are, you know,

01:54.781 --> 01:56.146
gonna get a divorce?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.982
I think it's okay
to dream, Morty.

01:58.076 --> 02:01.785
I'm gonna go make
some wooden stakes.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.746
♪♪

02:27.397 --> 02:29.479
♪♪

02:33.820 --> 02:36.357
I booked you for a two-day
intensive at Nuptia Four,

02:36.448 --> 02:39.110
the galaxy's most successful
couples' counseling institute.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.657
They could save
the marriage of a dog

02:40.744 --> 02:42.280
and a bar of dark chocolate.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.657
They could save
the marriage

02:43.747 --> 02:45.363
of a porn star
and a porn star.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.073
Well, I know I'm ready
to try whatever it takes.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.749
Which clearly implies
that I'm not.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.200
It's not
a competition, Beth.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.081
Oh is that how
you're gonna try to win,

02:52.172 --> 02:54.083
- by implying I'm competitive?
- If the shoe fits.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.915
- My shoe fits up your ass.
- You wish!

02:56.009 --> 02:57.841
Okay, have fun.
See ya Thursday!

02:58.095 --> 02:59.506
Oh!

02:59.596 --> 03:01.507
- Jerk.
- Don't insult my father.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.509
He's the reason our kids
are only half-stupid.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.216
Ha! You just called
yourself --

03:05.310 --> 03:06.425
Oh.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.102
- Beth and Jerry Smith?
- Yes.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.678
I'm Glaxo Slimslom.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.684
Welcome to Nuptia Four.

03:11.775 --> 03:14.233
Your marriage
can rest easy now.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.779
Jerry, go ahead and sit
there and put this on.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.527
This machine isolates
the part of the subject's brain

03:21.618 --> 03:24.827
containing all perceptions
of its romantic partner.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.947
And we will now render
Jerry's perception of Beth

03:28.041 --> 03:31.409
with artificial
biological life.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.705
Interesting.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.710
What the hell is that?!
Take that back!

03:37.801 --> 03:39.542
You do <i>not</i> think that
about me!

03:39.636 --> 03:41.377
I didn't do anything!
They scanned it out of my brain.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.132
Can I take it back?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.679
There's nothing to regret.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.803
We're dealing with
unconscious, unhealthy thoughts.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.429
Beth.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.761
Now, we scan for Beth's
perceptions of Jerry.

03:50.856 --> 03:53.473
- Scan hard. He's dead to me.
- Everything's dead to you.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.057
- What?
- Nothing.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.735
Read it and weep, bitch.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.442
Does everybody
see what I mean?

04:04.536 --> 04:06.743
I think we all see
what you both mean.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.326
Any leads
on the vampire?

04:10.417 --> 04:11.828
No, Summer!
I mean, you know,

04:11.918 --> 04:14.000
I think it might be time
that we just l-let it go.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.748
Oh, so, now, <i>you're</i>
too cool for this,

04:15.839 --> 04:17.250
just because
Grandpa Rick is?

04:17.339 --> 04:19.297
It's not that, it's just
that the universe

04:19.384 --> 04:21.591
is a little too big to care
about something so small.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.010
- Aah!
- What up, my Helsings?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.929
Who wants to hunt
a vampire? Ha ha ha!

04:26.183 --> 04:27.594
Rick?
How -- How did you --

04:27.684 --> 04:29.266
Yeah, I got bored
and then, I remembered,

04:29.352 --> 04:31.309
this morning, how I blew
Summer off, and I thought,

04:31.396 --> 04:33.057
"Hey, why are you such
a grumpy douche, Rick?

04:33.148 --> 04:34.604
Go to the garage,
transfer your mind

04:34.691 --> 04:36.307
into a younger clone of
yourself,

04:36.401 --> 04:38.142
and get embroiled
in some youthful hijinks.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.897
What's the BFD?"
So here I am.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.021
- I'm Tiny Rick!
- O-O-Okay.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.651
Well, it's good
you're here, Rick.

04:43.742 --> 04:44.903
I was pretty sure we
didn't have what it takes

04:45.160 --> 04:46.491
to deal with
a bloodsucker on our own.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.909
Don't short-sell
yourself, Summer.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.953
You got everything it takes.
But it'll still be fun...

04:50.207 --> 04:52.699
to do this as a fucking team,
motherfucker. Tiny Rick!

04:52.793 --> 04:55.626
Yeah! Oh, my God,
Toby Matthews!

04:55.712 --> 04:57.919
Hey, Toby. I'm Tiny Rick.
I'm new.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.130
Hey oh -- Go easy on me.
Ha ha. Just kiddin'.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.584
Hey, I like your
straightforward style

05:02.677 --> 05:04.418
and that lab coat's
pretty cool.

05:04.513 --> 05:05.799
Summer.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.675
He knows my name!

05:07.766 --> 05:09.052
Why wouldn't he?
You're great!

05:09.142 --> 05:10.598
But, listen,
just be careful.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.050
We can't rule anybody out
as the vampire,

05:12.145 --> 05:14.352
not even the dreamboats.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.600
Stop, Tiny Rick.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.647
Huntin' a vampire
with my grandkids!

05:17.734 --> 05:20.226
Fuck! Tiny Ri-i-ck!

05:20.320 --> 05:22.152
The next step is
to watch your mythologues

05:22.239 --> 05:25.322
interact together
and, uh -- big surprise --

05:25.408 --> 05:27.775
It's never pretty.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.486
Here we have Garrrh
and Zharbidar Gloompfschs,

05:30.580 --> 05:32.412
or, should I say,
here we have the way

05:32.499 --> 05:34.786
Garrrh and Zharbidar
perceive each other.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.577
As we can all see,

05:38.672 --> 05:40.788
this is hardly the real
Garrrh and Zharbidar.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.498
Which is good,
because the relationship

05:42.592 --> 05:45.209
in their heads
is not only ugly,

05:45.303 --> 05:47.544
it's unsustainable.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.555
You may already be
learning something important --

05:53.645 --> 05:55.807
All of these relationships
are different,

05:55.897 --> 05:58.810
none of them are real,
and none of them work.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.438
We are not the monsters
we sometimes see each other as,

06:02.529 --> 06:06.238
because we are real
and we are functional.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.407
That's what makes us
better than them.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.236
We can find solutions.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.616
We can adapt.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.869
We can communicate.

06:15.959 --> 06:19.668
And, most importantly,

06:19.754 --> 06:23.748
we can work together.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.133
Well, it was a tough
adventure, but it paid off --

06:27.220 --> 06:29.177
Our school is vampire-free!

06:29.264 --> 06:31.972
Man, who would've
suspected Coach Feratu?

06:32.058 --> 06:33.890
You did great, guys.
Couldn't have done it without ya.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.684
You know, we -- w-we
should be proud of ourselves.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.011
We killed a vampire
and a gym teacher.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.264
Ha ha ha.
Talk about two-for-one, right?!

06:40.358 --> 06:42.144
So, how, exactly,
is your old body living

06:42.235 --> 06:43.600
in there, Grandpa Rick?

06:43.695 --> 06:45.151
Oh, you know,
hyperbaric quantum fluid,

06:45.238 --> 06:47.149
... that kind of thing.
It preserves living tissue.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.197
Not that there was much
to preserve.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.992
Look at that mummy!
Ha! Ha ha!

06:52.078 --> 06:54.445
And I guess it's time for me
to get back inside the old-timer.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.405
Oh, my God.
Toby Matthews is asking...

06:56.499 --> 06:58.410
if my parents
are still out of town

06:58.501 --> 07:00.083
and if we can have a party!

07:00.337 --> 07:02.078
All right, way to go, Summer!
What did I tell you?

07:02.339 --> 07:05.457
Ohh! He's asking
if Tiny Rick will be here.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.166
Well, you know what, Summer?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.921
Tell him Tiny Rick <i>will</i> be here!

07:09.012 --> 07:10.628
And tell him to bring
some brews!

07:10.722 --> 07:12.963
For real? Y-Y-Y-You
would stay as Tiny Rick,

07:13.058 --> 07:14.765
just so we
can have a party?

07:14.851 --> 07:16.512
Hell, yeah!
What's one more night?

07:16.603 --> 07:19.061
And who can have fun with this
old bastard hanging around, huh?

07:19.314 --> 07:21.681
Wubby Iubby doob doob!

07:21.775 --> 07:23.436
- Whoo!
- Tiny Rick!

07:25.820 --> 07:28.403
Moving on.
Now, we have Beth and Jerry Smith

07:28.490 --> 07:30.401
from the planet E-Arth.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.449
- My heart is pounding.
- This is gonna be great.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.446
The E-Arth relationships
are simpler.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.120
It's a primitive planet,
so their dysfunctions are oh --

07:37.374 --> 07:38.910
W-Wait, what?
What's going on?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.661
Where are the Smith
mythologues?

07:45.757 --> 07:46.838
Oh, my god.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.841
Aah! Aah!

07:49.928 --> 07:52.966
- Oh, my god.
- Secure the cell!

07:53.056 --> 07:54.922
Aaaah!

07:55.016 --> 07:57.474
Uh, hey! You know what's fun?
Our gift shop.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.346
Why don't we proceed
in an orderly --

08:02.315 --> 08:03.476
Oh, dear god, no.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.809
They're codependent!
Run!

08:08.989 --> 08:09.979
Oh!

08:15.829 --> 08:17.615
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you really know how

08:17.706 --> 08:19.822
- to sport that color blue.
- Really?

08:19.916 --> 08:21.827
- You're looking real good.
- Oh, my god.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.909
- Hey, Morty.
- Oh, hey -- hey, Jessica.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.497
So, is Tiny Rick your
brother or cousin, or...?

08:27.590 --> 08:29.547
No, my grandpa just
transferred his consciousness

08:29.634 --> 08:31.966
into a clone of himself
so he could be in our high school.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.339
Cool.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.467
Hey, Tiny Rick's
playing guitar.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.717
All right, everybody.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.469
This next one's coming
straight from the heart.

Thanks, everybody!

09:09.758 --> 09:10.873
This guy's amazing!

09:10.967 --> 09:11.877
- I love Tiny Rick!
- Bad. Ass.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.756
Yeah!

09:23.897 --> 09:24.887
Aah!

09:33.531 --> 09:34.862
Huh?

09:34.949 --> 09:36.610
What the fuck?

09:36.701 --> 09:38.612
Yeah, I know! What kind
of operation are you running?

09:38.703 --> 09:41.411
Us?! What the hell kind of
relationship do you have?!

09:41.498 --> 09:42.784
Oh, right,
blame this on us.

09:42.874 --> 09:46.083
Okay, uh, I can and I am!

09:46.169 --> 09:49.753
Your demonized mythologizations
of each other are cooperating.

09:49.839 --> 09:53.082
- Isn't that good?
- No. No! It's bad!

09:53.176 --> 09:56.214
You have the single worst
marriage I've ever witnessed.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.053
It shouldn't exist!

09:58.139 --> 10:00.130
You should never, ever, ever,
have gotten together

10:00.225 --> 10:02.887
and I do not understand
how, or <i>why,</i>

10:02.977 --> 10:04.934
you would ever stay
together.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.261
Aaah!

10:06.523 --> 10:07.809
Well, this is just
bad couples' therapy.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.185
Totally.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.148
- Wait for us!
- There's only room for one more.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.983
I'm a therapist.
I'll talk to them.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.819
They're not therapists.
Go, go, go!

10:21.913 --> 10:23.950
There's gotta be a way
to contact my dad.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.906
Let's find a control room
or something.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.955
Beth! You'll want to see this.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.507
- What is it?
- It's a small, hinged panel...

10:35.593 --> 10:38.255
with a tiny amount
of space behind it.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.212
If you can find one, too,

10:40.306 --> 10:43.515
we should be safe for hours,
maybe days!

10:43.601 --> 10:45.968
You stay put, Jerry.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.303
I'll send help,
if I make it.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.272
You don't want to find
your own little hatch?

10:50.525 --> 10:53.108
Jerry, I believe that,
if you hide by yourself,

10:53.194 --> 10:55.401
you might survive
and I believe I,

10:55.488 --> 10:57.570
by myself, have a shot
of getting out of here,

10:57.657 --> 11:00.399
but the two of us,
together?

11:00.493 --> 11:01.858
I don't know.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.864
Look, maybe the shrink
was right.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.196
Good luck.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.455
All right, now,
you listen to me.

11:10.545 --> 11:11.660
Oh! Or don't.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.711
Hey! Don't! Please!

11:16.801 --> 11:18.257
Oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God!

11:18.344 --> 11:20.130
Now, I know I've said,
in the past,

11:20.221 --> 11:21.962
that math is important --
And it is! --

11:22.056 --> 11:24.423
But I also think that,
one day, you'll all look back

11:24.517 --> 11:28.101
on being in high school
with Tiny Rick and Morty,

11:28.188 --> 11:31.180
who I hear had a great
party last night.

11:31.274 --> 11:34.562
So, class dismissed.
You've got the day off!

11:34.652 --> 11:36.814
All right! Good work,
Mr. Goldenfold!

11:36.905 --> 11:38.771
Yeah, get outside.
Read a book.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.276
Put on some sunscreen,
Danielle!

11:40.366 --> 11:42.027
Hey, what's up, Summer?
Ooh, nice top.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.029
Thanks. Tiny Rick,
you think you might be

11:44.120 --> 11:45.736
getting back into
your old body tonight?

11:45.830 --> 11:47.741
No can do.
Tonight's the big dance.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.199
And Morty's bringing Jessica.
He needs his tiny wing man.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.000
Tiny Rick!

11:52.086 --> 11:54.669
Okay, but if not
tonight, when?

11:54.756 --> 11:56.212
I don't know.
When I feel like it?

11:56.299 --> 11:58.210
Damn, girl!
You need to chill out!

11:58.301 --> 12:00.383
This whole thing was your
idea, in the first place,

12:00.637 --> 12:02.219
and, now, you're trying
to rush it along.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.046
Yeah, and you know what?
I like high school.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.847
I like hanging out.
Tiny Rick!

12:05.934 --> 12:08.642
But what if the you
that likes it isn't you?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.310
Oh!

12:10.396 --> 12:11.978
Oh, Summer!

12:12.065 --> 12:13.772
It's just Rick
in a younger body.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.144
What's the -- What's --
What's -- What's --

12:15.235 --> 12:16.475
What's the --
What's the problem?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.230
Look at his art, Morty.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.063
I've got an emo streak.
Part of what makes me so rad.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.694
Why does it say "Help me
Morty and Summer!"?

12:23.785 --> 12:26.026
Come on, Summer,
that's the title of the art.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.157
Why was Knight Rider
called Knight Rider?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.489
The car's name was Kitt.
Nobody rode Michael Knight.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.200
You're overthinking it, Summer.
I'm Tiny Rick!

12:33.294 --> 12:35.205
Grandpa, I think that,
when you put your mind

12:35.296 --> 12:36.878
into this body's
young brain,

12:36.965 --> 12:38.501
it did what
young brains do --

12:38.591 --> 12:40.127
It shoved the bad
thoughts into the back

12:40.218 --> 12:41.959
and put a wall
around them.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.260
But those bad thoughts
are the real Rick.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.054
The fact that you're old,

12:46.140 --> 12:47.801
the fact that we're all
going to die one day,

12:47.892 --> 12:49.633
the fact that the universe
is so big,

12:49.727 --> 12:52.344
nothing in it matters --
those facts are who you are.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.304
So you're trapped in there
and you can only come out

12:54.399 --> 12:56.982
in the form of
Tiny Rick's teen angst!

12:57.068 --> 12:59.400
Well, <i>Summer,</i> I hear

12:59.487 --> 13:01.774
Toby Matthews
isn't into psycho chicks.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.446
Can't think of anyone
that is.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.112
I'll see you motherfuckers
at the dance! Tiny Rick!

13:06.202 --> 13:07.818
Morty, you have
to help me!

13:07.912 --> 13:09.823
Summer, he's happy!
I'm happy!

13:09.914 --> 13:11.621
I-I-Is that why
you're doing this,

13:11.708 --> 13:13.198
you don't want me
and Rick to be happy?

13:13.293 --> 13:15.204
- No.
- Then get your shit together!

13:15.295 --> 13:17.912
Get it all together
and put it in a backpack.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.714
All your shit,
so it's together.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.208
And if you gotta
take it somewhere,

13:23.303 --> 13:24.668
take it somewhere,
you know?

13:24.762 --> 13:26.218
Take it to the shit store
and sell it

13:26.306 --> 13:28.547
o-or put it in a shit museum.
I don't care what you do!

13:28.641 --> 13:30.223
You just gotta
get it together.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.302
Get your shit together.

13:38.109 --> 13:40.316
Get back!

13:40.403 --> 13:43.020
Wait, for real?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.481
You're how Beth sees me?

13:46.743 --> 13:49.485
Oh, my god.
Turn around!

13:49.746 --> 13:51.328
I said turn around!

13:51.414 --> 13:53.576
How can Beth have
these thoughts about me?!

13:53.666 --> 13:56.249
That judgmental
monster bitch!

13:56.336 --> 13:58.043
I'm not taking this.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.460
I want to know
where my wife is.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.500
You are going to
help me.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.795
No!
Nobody's doing that!

14:06.679 --> 14:08.590
Stay.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.423
- What do you want?
- Jerrys.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.475
You want <i>Jerry?</i>
I don't even want Jerry.

14:14.729 --> 14:17.266
I want Jerrys.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.477
An army.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.942
An army of Jerrys.

14:23.029 --> 14:26.613
The value of his subservience
is wasted on you.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.862
I will use it to dominate
the universe.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.659
Ah ha ha. Boy, Jerry must
think I'm pretty stupid,

14:31.746 --> 14:33.282
for you
to be this stupid.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.909
Wouldn't it make more sense

14:34.999 --> 14:36.910
to put my dumb-ass husband
in this chair,

14:37.001 --> 14:38.912
so you can make an army
of <i>your</i> badass self?

14:40.588 --> 14:42.499
There could never be more
than one of me.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.548
I'm the strongest,
smartest being alive

14:45.802 --> 14:48.544
because <i>Jerry</i> thinks
you're that much stronger

14:48.805 --> 14:51.888

Tiny Rick, hey,
great dancing as usual.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.222
Moment of your time?

15:42.316 --> 15:44.057
Tiny Rick,
this conversation

15:44.152 --> 15:45.893
is gonna break
my heart wide open.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.523
You're a great student
and the fact that

15:47.613 --> 15:49.354
you're an 80-year-old man
in a clone body,

15:49.449 --> 15:51.031
it never bothered me.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.357
But this here
is another matter.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.318
You recognize this?

15:54.412 --> 15:56.198
We got a tip
it was in your locker.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.200
Yeah, now, because
the gym coach was a vampire,

15:58.291 --> 15:59.952
the school board
is embarrassed

16:00.042 --> 16:01.624
and won't take it public,
however,

16:01.878 --> 16:03.289
they can't have students
killin' teachers.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.290
I gotta expel you
for this one, TR.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.418
I'm sorry.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.337
I just got expelled,
Summer!

16:10.428 --> 16:13.216
Oh! So I guess there's
no need to stay young.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.217

- Screw your top!

You ratted on me?!
I'm Tiny Rick!

16:17.143 --> 16:19.009

Jerry Smith!

17:16.618 --> 17:17.905
- Yeah, here.
- Aha!

17:17.994 --> 17:19.702
Okay, fair enough.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.666
Say goodnight, old man.

Summer, you bitch!

17:33.719 --> 17:35.710
Don't talk to her that way!
She's your granddaughter!

17:35.972 --> 17:38.179
I don't need a granddaughter!
I'm Tiny Ri-i-ck!

17:38.266 --> 17:40.177
She's my sister!
And if Tiny Rick is

- Then make a me that can!

Good lord.
How did you...?

19:42.056 --> 19:43.672
Well, I had a feeling
that, in your mind,

19:43.766 --> 19:45.507
the ideal version of me
is one smart enough

19:45.601 --> 19:47.262
to see you as...

19:47.353 --> 19:48.843
a goddess.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.221
Not such a stupid worm
now, are you?

19:51.315 --> 19:53.932
Honey, when it comes
to the subject of your ego,

19:54.026 --> 19:55.983

Holy shit!
Thanks, kids.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.122
You figured it out.
Well, Summer did.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.203
Kind of weird that
you were that willing

20:15.297 --> 20:17.288
to sell my existence out
for some trim, Morty.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.839
- What?!
- Pants!

20:19.093 --> 20:20.800
But listen -- I forgive you both
because you know what?

20:20.886 --> 20:22.718
I learned, today,
something important --

20:22.805 --> 20:24.421
The teenage mind
is its own worst enemy.

20:24.515 --> 20:25.721
Oh, I also learned this...

20:27.685 --> 20:30.677
Operation Phoenix is not
the fallback I thought it would be.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.432
I guess it's back
to the drawing board.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.356
Oh, my God!

20:35.443 --> 20:38.231
- Oh, my God.

Oh, man, I gotta pick up
your parents.

So, what do you think?
You wanna...

20:55.546 --> 20:57.207
keep this marriage
going a while longer?

20:57.298 --> 21:00.711
At least until Morty has
graduated high school.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.417
Oh. Mm.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.754
Aha, you see?
What did I tell you two?

21:06.849 --> 21:08.135
It worked.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.715
You know what, Rick?
I guess, in a way --

21:09.810 --> 21:11.926
Already lost interest.
Get in the car.

there's a bunch of dead mes
in the garage.

21:19.320 --> 21:22.654
Huh! Sounds like our stories
were connected by a theme.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.902
Not really, Jerry.

21:24.992 --> 21:28.280
Probably a cosmetic connection
your mind <i>mistakes</i> for thematic.
