Baloo!
Where did you get all that money?

01:22.250 --> 01:26.166
From saving a little at a time
for a long time.

01:26.250 --> 01:30.792
It's still not enough...
to buy back the <i>Sea Duck, </i> but it will be.

01:30.875 --> 01:35.000
In six weeks,
we should be living free and easy.

01:35.500 --> 01:36.917
Wait a second.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.834
Thanks, partner.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.625
Oh, man, oh, man.

01:47.709 --> 01:50.875
[chuckles]
I hate to leave all this freedom,

01:50.959 --> 01:54.250
but Becky'll bust her briefcase
if we're late getting back.

01:54.333 --> 01:59.000
Gosh, Baloo, we can't travel
on empty stomachs, can we?

01:59.083 --> 02:01.542
You win.
Two more minutes.

02:01.625 --> 02:04.959
I need to practice for all that
free time we're gonna have

02:05.041 --> 02:07.417
when I buy back the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

02:08.125 --> 02:11.500
Yuck! You got bait in my peanut butter!

02:11.583 --> 02:13.834
You got peanut butter in my bait.

02:13.917 --> 02:19.417
[groans] What a waste of perfectly good
triple-action twisted wigglies.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.208
[squeals]

02:27.542 --> 02:30.500
[Kit]
Wow! Look at the size of him.

02:34.542 --> 02:37.792
I'm glad we only dropped
one bucket of bait.

02:37.875 --> 02:40.542
Uh... hi there, whaley.

02:40.625 --> 02:42.542
-Whoa!
-[Baloo] Kit!

02:42.625 --> 02:45.709
Hang on, Kit!
I'm coming! I'm coming!

02:54.583 --> 02:57.083
This guy's more fun
than a roller coaster.

02:57.166 --> 03:01.291
[coughing]
Yeah, and soggier, too.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.625
[squealing]

03:05.291 --> 03:08.500
It's the peanut butter bait.
He wants more, I'll bet.

03:11.917 --> 03:14.834
Come on, sit up, boy.
Can you sit up?

03:15.917 --> 03:19.500
Say, that guppy's friendly as a puppy.

03:19.583 --> 03:21.625
[squealing]

03:28.709 --> 03:31.458
Roll over, boy.
Come on, roll over.

03:36.208 --> 03:39.959
[laughs]
Can I keep him, Papa Bear? Please?

03:40.041 --> 03:44.583
Keep him? Why, you'd need a fishbowl
the size of Thembria.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.583
He'd make a great pet.

03:46.667 --> 03:49.083
Look at it from his side,
little britches,

03:49.166 --> 03:53.458
just 'cause we can't play here all day,
doesn't mean he shouldn't be able to.

03:53.542 --> 03:57.291
Now, say so long.
We really have to get back to work.

03:57.375 --> 03:59.000
Bye, big guy.

03:59.083 --> 04:00.125
[squeals]

04:01.125 --> 04:02.834
We'll be back, boy.

04:02.917 --> 04:04.458
[squeals]

04:11.875 --> 04:14.625
[Baloo] Kit and Baloo,
reporting for duty, Miss Cunningham.

04:14.709 --> 04:18.959
Spit-shined, looking fine,
and back a whole five minutes early.

04:19.041 --> 04:23.625
[whistles] Say, now.
What's with all the customers?

04:23.709 --> 04:27.458
It's the missing whale
from Seymore's See More Seaquarium.

04:29.417 --> 04:31.542
-Missing whale?
-Yes.

04:31.625 --> 04:34.458
The whole afternoon is booked solid
with customers who want

04:34.542 --> 04:36.417
five minutes of air time to search for it.

04:38.500 --> 04:43.667
But why's everybody so hot to find
some overgrown tuna fish?

04:44.417 --> 04:47.875
[Rebecca]
Because of the reward money.

04:48.750 --> 04:53.250
Oh, this reward and our stashed cash,
could buy back the <i>Sea Duck, Kit.</i>

04:53.333 --> 04:56.875
And if the whale's at the Seaquarium,
I could visit him every day!

04:56.959 --> 04:59.917
Will you please get to work?

05:00.000 --> 05:05.250
Work? We've still got
four whole minutes of break time left.

05:23.041 --> 05:26.542
Bless my lucky starfish,
you found my whale.

05:26.625 --> 05:29.500
Oh, you have no idea
what this means to me.

05:29.583 --> 05:32.208
As long as it means moola to us.

05:32.917 --> 05:37.917
Oodles of moola, as soon as Moby Dimple
is back and performing.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.959
Just let me load
my special whale retrieval equipment.

05:43.458 --> 05:47.250
You mean your whale's done
this disappearing act before?

05:47.333 --> 05:49.500
Oh, my goodness, yes.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.917
You see, Moby Dimple
is just too young to understand

05:53.000 --> 05:55.917
that tame whale
can't survive in the wild.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.166
I don't know.
He looked OK to me.

05:58.250 --> 06:01.750
Mm, which will you believe,
me or your own eyes?

06:04.917 --> 06:07.500
Hey, what's this doing here?

06:07.583 --> 06:11.834
A Smith &amp; Wesson oil
double-barreled harpoon?

06:11.917 --> 06:13.500
Those things are illegal.

06:13.583 --> 06:15.667
And they're against the law, too.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.583
Uh, only if you hunt with them.

06:18.667 --> 06:23.291
You see, this is a museum piece,
from the Seaquarium's collection.

06:23.375 --> 06:27.792
So, boys, let's go find my whale, hmm?

06:34.291 --> 06:36.500
Whenever you're ready, boys.

06:39.291 --> 06:42.875
Here, Dimple! We're back!
We brought treats.

06:47.542 --> 06:48.625
[squeals]

06:48.709 --> 06:49.792
Catch, boy.

06:55.208 --> 06:58.458
Come to Papa, you naughty boy.

07:02.709 --> 07:04.291
[squeals]

07:09.208 --> 07:10.333
[Seymore] Got him!

07:27.750 --> 07:30.667
Hold your seahorses, Dimple, hon.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.959
I'll have you back
making money in no time.

07:34.583 --> 07:36.875
Here are two free passes!

07:36.959 --> 07:40.959
Come catch the show,
and we'll square up the reward money!

07:41.667 --> 07:45.583
Well, Seymore got his whale,
and we got <i>the Sea Duck.</i>

07:45.667 --> 07:48.792
This is our lucky day, little britches.

07:48.875 --> 07:52.041
[Kit]
Yeah, great. Just great.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.500
[carnival music playing]

07:58.375 --> 08:00.875
[crowd cheering]

08:04.959 --> 08:10.834
And now, for the grand finale,
the great Moby Dimple

08:10.917 --> 08:14.500
will leap 50 feet into the air

08:14.583 --> 08:20.542
through the amazing hoop of doom!

08:21.250 --> 08:23.291
[crowd exclaiming]

08:23.375 --> 08:24.875
I don't like the looks of this.

08:26.709 --> 08:29.917
Don't worry, Kit.
It's just part of the act.

08:39.457 --> 08:40.542
[squeals]

08:44.959 --> 08:46.750
[crowd groans]

08:46.834 --> 08:48.000
[squeals]

08:50.500 --> 08:54.083
Oh, thank you.
I'm very lucky. Thank you.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.250
[gasps]
Dimple burned his tail, Baloo!

08:56.959 --> 09:00.834
Well, like I'm telling you,
it's all part of the act...

09:00.917 --> 09:02.542
I think.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.917
Hey, there, Seymore.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.875
Hi, fellas.
I'd give you my thanks,

09:07.959 --> 09:12.417
but I think you want
the reward money more. [chuckles]

09:12.500 --> 09:15.083
Uh, Mr. Seymore,
I think Dimple hurt his tail.

09:15.166 --> 09:17.917
Oh, not to worry,
it happens all the time.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.709
He's just an animal.
Doesn't feel a thing.

09:20.792 --> 09:25.709
Besides, people aren't paying
to see his tail. [chuckles]

09:25.792 --> 09:28.875
Golly, you could fry an egg
on those seals.

09:28.959 --> 09:32.375
-They could use some shade.
-Yeah, but that costs money.

09:32.458 --> 09:35.792
Shade doesn't grow on trees, you know.
[chuckles]

09:38.917 --> 09:40.333
[coughing]

09:40.417 --> 09:44.041
Oh, this tank is dirtier
than last week's laundry.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.709
You ever clean these things, Seymore?

09:46.792 --> 09:49.083
Sure, I do.
But that costs moola, too.

09:49.166 --> 09:52.500
In this racket, Baloo, slime is money.
[chuckles]

09:55.750 --> 09:59.542
-[Kit] But, Mr. Seymore--
-Look, this is my park,

09:59.625 --> 10:02.792
and I'll run it any way I please.

10:02.875 --> 10:06.250
Hey, don't strip your scales,
there, Seymore.

10:06.333 --> 10:09.917
You did your job, you got your pay.
Now scram.

10:11.917 --> 10:17.625
Hooey. That guy's about as pleasant
as a pair of sandpaper underpants.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.542
We did it!

10:24.667 --> 10:27.583
[breathes deeply]
Smell that air, Kit?

10:27.667 --> 10:30.875
That's how air smells when you're free.

10:30.959 --> 10:32.583
It stinks.

10:32.667 --> 10:35.500
Well, we are downwind of the bait tanks.

10:35.583 --> 10:39.125
No, I mean, our freedom
cost Dimple his freedom,

10:39.208 --> 10:40.959
and I think that stinks!

10:41.041 --> 10:43.375
Now, take it easy, little britches.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.875
For all we know, that whale likes it here.

10:45.959 --> 10:48.208
Oh, and you believe that, Papa Bear?

10:48.291 --> 10:53.375
[sighs] No, I don't believe it.
But what can we do about it now?

10:53.458 --> 10:55.375
Seymore won't listen to us.

10:56.917 --> 11:00.750
But I do know someone
he'll have to listen to.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.041
Come on.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.375
Another sold out show.
Boys, that whale is a money magnet.

11:17.458 --> 11:18.458
[knocking]

11:18.542 --> 11:21.375
I'm out of tickets, chump.
You'll have to come back, later.

11:21.458 --> 11:23.083
[man]
I think not, sir.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.959
I'm here to inspect your park.

11:27.041 --> 11:29.959
-My name's Burrough.
-Rhymes with thorough.

11:31.125 --> 11:34.041
It's another inspection.
You two know what to do.

11:36.458 --> 11:41.542
Uh, inspector, sir, what say
we get acquainted before the grand tour?

11:41.625 --> 11:43.625
Who'd you say you're with?

11:43.709 --> 11:44.792
A.C.H.O.O.

11:44.875 --> 11:46.709
Uh... <i>gesundheit.</i>

11:46.792 --> 11:49.375
No.
That's A.C.H.O.O.

11:49.458 --> 11:53.667
As in the Agency Concerned with
the Happiness of Oceanic Oddities.

11:54.417 --> 11:57.834
And if Inspector Burrough doesn't think
you'd be keeping the animals happy,

11:57.917 --> 12:00.083
he'll shut down your whole park!

12:00.166 --> 12:02.458
Well, let's get to it, shall we?

12:02.542 --> 12:05.458
Why certainly.
Follow me.

12:09.709 --> 12:11.458
Cheese it.
They're coming.

12:20.667 --> 12:25.417
Man, an hour ago this place was
in worse shape than Wildcat's lunchbox.

12:25.500 --> 12:29.417
I like a man
who shades his seals, Seymore.

12:29.500 --> 12:33.750
But, your inspectorship,
those green leafies weren't there before.

12:33.834 --> 12:39.709
Fast-growing tropical hybrids, sir.
I have special fertilizers.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.959
That I believe.

12:52.375 --> 12:55.333
Hey, what's the deal with the aquarium?

12:55.417 --> 13:00.083
In my business, we call that clean,
not to be confused with dirty.

13:00.542 --> 13:04.333
Ah, but I don't want to give away
too many trade secrets.

13:04.417 --> 13:08.959
Inspector, believe me,
Seymore here is pulling some sort of scam.

13:09.041 --> 13:12.250
If S.C.A.M. stands for,
Super Clean and Marvelous,

13:12.333 --> 13:16.000
-then you're right.
-Oh, thank you, sir.

13:19.041 --> 13:22.291
No, no, wait a minute.
You haven't seen the whale.

13:22.375 --> 13:24.333
He's miserable.
You'll see.

13:24.417 --> 13:28.500
One miserable whale coming up.

13:29.667 --> 13:33.333
Now, that tank looks mighty tiny, Seymore.

13:33.417 --> 13:35.041
And it's awfully close to the sharks.

13:35.125 --> 13:38.625
Oh, Dimple likes the company.

13:38.709 --> 13:42.250
Besides, his performance tank
is much bigger.

13:42.333 --> 13:45.875
But he likes it cozy, don't you, boy?

13:45.959 --> 13:50.959
Our special code:
one spout for no, two for yes.

13:51.041 --> 13:53.458
[clears throat]
Ahoy, in there!

13:53.542 --> 13:55.458
Are you happy, Dimple?

13:57.291 --> 14:00.917
See? One spout for no, so there!

14:01.000 --> 14:05.542
He's happy!
Two spouts for yes.

14:13.583 --> 14:17.625
Here's your inspection certificate.
This place is outstanding.

14:17.709 --> 14:20.625
I won't have to inspect you
for an entire year.

14:20.709 --> 14:22.458
[chuckles]
Congratulations.

14:22.542 --> 14:26.750
As for you, Baloo,
you've wasted my precious time.

14:26.834 --> 14:28.000
Don't let it happen again.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.834
Hey, we've got to do something.

14:29.917 --> 14:32.166
We can't leave Dimple here
with this creep.

14:32.250 --> 14:36.500
OK, Seymore.
Let's talk turkey about your whale.

14:36.583 --> 14:42.041
Hmm... You want to buy my whale
with the reward money?

14:42.125 --> 14:43.875
Plus ten times more.

14:43.959 --> 14:46.917
But, Baloo, that's the money
you saved for the <i>Sea Duck!</i>

14:47.000 --> 14:49.333
The money we saved, little britches.

14:49.417 --> 14:53.041
And I can't think of
a better way to spend it.

14:53.125 --> 14:57.709
That whale brings in
a hundred times that each day.

14:57.792 --> 15:01.959
I suppose I should appreciate
you helping me catch Dimple

15:02.041 --> 15:03.834
and getting my
inspection certificate,

15:03.917 --> 15:07.041
but gratitude only stretches so far.

15:07.125 --> 15:10.041
Now, I want you troublemakers
out of my park!

15:12.125 --> 15:14.417
Not before I say goodbye to Dimple.

15:15.458 --> 15:20.709
All right. But I'm not responsible
if anything happens.

15:22.041 --> 15:24.208
[squealing]

15:37.750 --> 15:39.834
Oh, you haven't heard the last of this.

15:39.917 --> 15:42.125
[both yelling]

15:43.041 --> 15:45.625
Oh, I think I have, Kit.

15:45.709 --> 15:49.250
I really think I have.

15:51.291 --> 15:56.333
[both yelling]
Help! Help! Help! Help!

15:56.417 --> 15:59.000
Help! Help!

15:59.083 --> 16:03.000
-Help! Help!
-Help! Help!

16:03.083 --> 16:05.333
-Help! Help!
-Help!

16:05.417 --> 16:07.542
-Help! Help!
-Help!

16:24.875 --> 16:26.291
[yelling]

16:27.542 --> 16:29.375
[squealing]

16:29.458 --> 16:31.125
Dimple saved us.

16:31.208 --> 16:34.792
He sure did,
and it's time we returned the favor.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.208
Come on, Kit!

16:46.458 --> 16:49.583
There's a guy out there
with a really big package

16:49.667 --> 16:51.583
and a really big bill.

16:51.667 --> 16:56.458
Wildcat, old buddy, tell the delivery man
we'll be there in a minute with the dough.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.375
-You ready, Kit?
-Lead on, Papa Bear.

17:04.208 --> 17:10.125
Hey, Baloo, Kit, I did it!
So, exactly what did I do?

17:12.583 --> 17:16.083
That, old buddy,
is the Acme Portable Whale Lift.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.500
See, all we need now is a whale.

17:18.583 --> 17:21.125
You can leave that to us, Wildcat.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.875
Yeah, we know just the spot to catch one.

17:24.959 --> 17:29.208
Just so I don't have to throw 'em back
'cause they're heavy.

17:34.750 --> 17:37.917
[Baloo] Say, friend,
could you move a little faster?

17:38.000 --> 17:41.583
Now, let's get this pup into the brandy
before he melts.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.166
[barking]

17:43.250 --> 17:46.250
The boss didn't say
he was expecting any deliveries.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.750
Well, of course, he didn't.
I'm not delivering the seal to him,

17:49.834 --> 17:53.875
-I'm delivering the him to you.
-Oh, OK.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.208
Meet you at the whale tank
in ten minutes.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.000
[Seymore]
Hey, what's this seal doing here?

18:10.083 --> 18:11.625
We have a show to do.

18:11.709 --> 18:14.709
All I need is to start the show
a seal short.

18:14.792 --> 18:16.166
[barking]

18:22.417 --> 18:27.000
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

18:27.083 --> 18:31.041
and welcome to the wettest show on earth.

18:32.125 --> 18:35.417
And now, for your viewing amusement,

18:35.500 --> 18:38.542
our amazing seals!

18:39.667 --> 18:41.083
Hit it, gang.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.083
[audience groans]

18:48.166 --> 18:53.208
Well, perhaps the seals
are in a musical mood today.

18:57.625 --> 18:58.917
[spits]

19:03.917 --> 19:07.375
How about a little classical music?

19:08.542 --> 19:11.417
[honking]

19:12.417 --> 19:15.375
[laughs]
That was classical, all right.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.125
Classically bad!

19:17.208 --> 19:19.083
[crowd booing]

19:23.834 --> 19:26.667
Get back here.
The show isn't over yet.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.041
It's the kid!

19:32.500 --> 19:34.083
[barking]

19:45.166 --> 19:48.834
Dimple, it's me!
Jump, boy! Jump!

19:57.667 --> 19:59.583
[crowd cheering]

20:06.291 --> 20:09.625
Nobody steals my whale.

20:15.333 --> 20:16.709
We did it, Baloo.

20:16.792 --> 20:17.667
[rumbling]

20:17.750 --> 20:21.375
[Baloo] Yeah, but that clam jockey's
right behind us.

20:21.458 --> 20:24.542
Give up, you thieves, you.

20:24.625 --> 20:29.458
Hey, what do you say we give Burrough
something worth inspecting?

20:40.208 --> 20:42.208
Nah... couldn't be.

20:50.041 --> 20:53.792
That's a Smith &amp; Wesson oil
double-barreled harpoon.

20:53.875 --> 20:56.250
Nobody slips one of those past A.C.H.O.O.

21:02.375 --> 21:04.834
[plane approaching]

21:08.917 --> 21:13.125
All right, you no-good carnivores.
Where's my whale?

21:13.208 --> 21:18.041
Why, Seymore, you must have us
mixed up with somebody else.

21:18.125 --> 21:20.959
We've been fishing all day.

21:21.041 --> 21:23.542
[siren blaring]

21:24.458 --> 21:28.834
Inspector, I demand
you do something about this.

21:28.917 --> 21:31.625
I intend to, Seymore.

21:31.709 --> 21:35.041
You're under arrest
for possession of an illegal harpoon.

21:35.125 --> 21:37.250
But inspector, I--

21:37.333 --> 21:41.083
I knew from the start
there was something fishy about you.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.542
[siren blaring]

21:44.458 --> 21:47.417
OK, Dimple, coast is clear!

21:51.250 --> 21:53.208
[Dimple squealing]

22:04.000 --> 22:07.166
[Kit]
Now he has the whole ocean to play in.
