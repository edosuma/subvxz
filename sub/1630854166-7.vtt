40:45.153 --> 40:48.031
and I've been in private practice now
for almost five years.

40:48.031 --> 40:51.285
I've helped attorneys, detectives,
private investigators

40:51.285 --> 40:55.581
by rigorously studying the scene
and providing important insights.

40:55.581 --> 40:57.332
- And were you able
to thoroughly investigate

40:57.332 --> 40:58.792
the crime scene in this case?

40:58.792 --> 41:02.504
- Yes. What struck me was
how shoddily the scene was investigated,

41:02.504 --> 41:04.047
according to the reports.

41:04.047 --> 41:06.300
When I examine the crime scene,

41:06.300 --> 41:09.428
I see multiple things
that were overlooked.

41:09.428 --> 41:12.598
One in particular seems integral
to this case.

41:12.598 --> 41:13.640
- And what is that?

41:13.640 --> 41:15.976
- The murder weapon
has a partial fingerprint on it

41:15.976 --> 41:18.395
right here that was never tested.

41:18.395 --> 41:22.733
There are clearly at least
10 points on this partial, maybe even 14.

41:22.733 --> 41:26.278
Even with 10 or 12 points,
it can be ID'd to an individual.

41:26.278 --> 41:28.322
In this case,
I compared the partial to both

41:28.322 --> 41:31.491
Brayden Miller
and Kaleesha Moore's fingerprints.

41:31.491 --> 41:32.910
- And what did you find?

41:32.910 --> 41:34.161
- It doesn't match either of them.

41:34.953 --> 41:37.789
There was a third-party fingerprint
on the murder weapon,

41:37.789 --> 41:40.834
and the LAPD just ignored it completely.

41:40.834 --> 41:42.753
- Just to make sure
that I'm following you,

41:42.753 --> 41:45.631
the crime scene clearly reveals
a partial fingerprint

41:45.631 --> 41:49.009
on the murder weapon
that the LAPD neglected to run?

41:49.009 --> 41:50.052
- Exactly.

41:50.052 --> 41:52.679
- And it does not match
Brayden Miller nor the victim?

41:52.679 --> 41:53.764
- That is correct.

41:54.223 --> 41:55.265
- Thank you.

41:56.725 --> 41:59.102
- You were employed at the LAPD
for 18 years?

41:59.102 --> 42:00.270
- That's correct.

42:00.270 --> 42:01.730
- And is it true that after you left,

42:01.730 --> 42:04.316
you filed a wrongful termination suit
against the LAPD?

42:04.316 --> 42:07.569
- Yes, I was demoted and fired
with almost no warning.

42:07.569 --> 42:11.365
As the only Latina at my rank,
I had to address that.

42:11.365 --> 42:14.868
- I'm bringing this up because
you botched a case for the LAPD

42:14.868 --> 42:16.578
shortly before you were let go.

42:16.578 --> 42:19.373
Did you make a major error
in your investigation

42:19.373 --> 42:20.916
of a violent crime scene

42:20.916 --> 42:23.418
that cost the state its case
to catch the killer?

42:24.336 --> 42:26.505
- I did make a mistake in that case.

42:26.505 --> 42:27.923
MIKE:
One more thing.

42:27.923 --> 42:30.676
That partial print,
was it on the stem of the murder weapon?

42:30.676 --> 42:32.845
The part of the glass
used to kill Kaleesha Moore?

42:32.845 --> 42:35.180
- No, it was located on the bowl.

42:35.180 --> 42:36.765
MIKE:
Nothing further.

42:37.516 --> 42:39.810
- Liliana, how many cases
were you involved in

42:39.810 --> 42:41.645
during your tenure at the LAPD?

42:41.645 --> 42:43.146
- Three hundred eighty-seven.

42:43.146 --> 42:47.276
- And of those 387 cases,
how many did you botch?

42:47.276 --> 42:48.318
- One.

42:48.318 --> 42:51.905
- So you were
a highly successful member of the team.

42:51.905 --> 42:55.868
Would you eliminate a partial fingerprint
from the murder weapon

42:55.868 --> 42:58.787
simply because it was located
on the bowl of the wine glass

42:58.787 --> 43:00.163
and not the stem?

43:00.163 --> 43:02.624
- No. All fingerprints at a crime scene

43:02.624 --> 43:05.294
should be included
in the report and tested,

43:05.294 --> 43:07.546
especially if they're on
the murder weapon.

43:07.546 --> 43:09.590

JAX: As Judge Green stated,

43:09.590 --> 43:12.718
we're here to discuss your official report
of the crime scene.

43:12.718 --> 43:15.262
Now, is it true
that your report was edited

43:15.262 --> 43:17.097
prior to being submitted to discovery?

43:17.097 --> 43:20.309
- The way I had
originally written it was unclear.

43:20.934 --> 43:23.395
So I was asked to condense for clarity.

43:23.395 --> 43:25.272
- So who would ask you
to make those changes

43:25.272 --> 43:27.774
before submitting your final report?

43:28.692 --> 43:30.068
- The police lieutenant.

43:42.581 --> 43:45.417
You're saying
that a senior-ranking LAPD officer

43:45.417 --> 43:48.504
asked you to change your report
to eliminate the possibility

there's nothing that matched

within the police database.

44:11.527 --> 44:14.446
