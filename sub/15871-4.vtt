10:04.871 --> 10:05.971
TO CANCEL HER WEDDING?

10:05.973 --> 10:08.340
A MAN IN LOVE.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.609
WE HAVE TO GET THAT TO HER
RIGHT AWAY.

10:10.611 --> 10:11.743
MY COUSIN, DEMETRIA,

10:11.745 --> 10:12.911
SHE HAD TO CANCEL
HER WEDDING

10:12.913 --> 10:13.979
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.280
SHE PLANNED IT
DURING A CONJUGAL VISIT,

10:15.282 --> 10:17.616
BUT DIDN'T FACTOR IN
A LOCKDOWN, SO...

10:19.852 --> 10:21.853
I'M CONCERNED WHAT DAMAGE
THIS MIGHT DO

10:21.855 --> 10:24.823
IF SHE WERE TO RECEIVE THIS
ONLY DAYS PRIOR TO HER NUPTIALS.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.191
ARE YOU ACTUALLY
CONSIDERING DELAYING

10:26.193 --> 10:27.726
THE PROMPT DELIVERY
OF A LETTER?

10:27.728 --> 10:29.728
MARRIAGE IS SACRED,
MS. McINERNEY.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.896
YES, BUT SHE'S NOT MARRIED YET.
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT!

10:31.898 --> 10:34.099
LET'S JUST ASSUME FOR A MINUTE,

10:34.101 --> 10:35.900
THAT SHE'S MARRYING
THE WRONG MAN,

10:35.902 --> 10:38.670
AND SAM IS HER TRUE SOULMATE.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.772
I WONDER HOW MUCH TIME
WE HAVE.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.374
IN THE LETTER,
MARIE SAID SATURDAY.

10:42.376 --> 10:45.110
WELL, THAT COULD BE
THIS SATURDAY OR NEXT SATURDAY.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.845
IT'S HARD TO TELL
WITHOUT THE FULL DATE.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.313
YEAH, BUT, HEY,
IF WE CAN'T FIND MARIE,

10:48.315 --> 10:50.248
MAYBE WE CAN FIND SAM.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.716
UH, UM,

10:51.718 --> 10:54.085
THAT LEDGER PAPER IS USED
TO COUNT LIVESTOCK--

10:54.087 --> 10:56.788
UH, AGE, SIZE, WEIGHT,
THAT SORT OF THING.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.691
IT'S NOT JUST A GUEST RANCH,
IT'S ALSO A WORKING RANCH, TOO,

10:59.693 --> 11:01.393
SO THAT MIGHT
NARROW IT DOWN A BIT.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.795
-[ROTARY PHONE RINGS]
-[GASPS]

11:03.797 --> 11:05.030
WHAT'S THAT?

11:06.932 --> 11:08.400
IT'S A PHONE.

11:08.402 --> 11:10.201
[SHANE]: OH.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.203

11:16.909 --> 11:18.209

OLIVER O'TOOLE.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.919
YES.

11:29.755 --> 11:30.922

11:30.924 --> 11:32.390
NO.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.693
MY GOODNESS,
THAT'S, UH... TERRIBLE.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.129
WHAT ABOUT OUR WEDNESDAYS?

11:39.765 --> 11:43.435
UH, PLEASE LET ME KNOW
THE MOMENT ANYTHING CHANGES.

12:10.464 --> 12:11.763
I DON'T KNOW.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.064
I MEAN, HE HAS CHOIR,

12:13.066 --> 12:14.799
BUT I THOUGHT
THAT WAS THURSDAYS.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.101
HE DOES DRESS
A LITTLE SPIFFIER

12:16.103 --> 12:17.201
ON WEDNESDAYS.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.404
AND SOMETIMES,
HE EVEN WEARS COLOGNE.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.073
DON'T YOU EVER WONDER WHAT
HE DOES OUTSIDE OF THIS PLACE?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.876
WELL, HE'S SUCH A MAN
OF MYSTERY, YOU KNOW.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.478

TO MONTANA IN 1889.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.519
SHE FALLS IN LOVE

UH, CORA HAS US ON
A PRETTY TIGHT DEADLINE

13:00.180 --> 13:02.447

13:02.449 --> 13:04.349
NORMAN'S RIGHT.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.985
WE HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED
ON OUR WORK.

I'M GONNA TAKE 'EM ON UP

YOU LOOK GREAT.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.879
SO DO YOU!

14:09.014 --> 14:11.416

A TOTAL COINCIDENCE.

39:42.513 --> 39:45.582
[♪]

39:49.820 --> 39:51.121
MAYBE THERE'S
SOMETHING THERE

39:51.123 --> 39:52.889
YOU CAN PUT
IN YOUR BOOK, HUH?

39:52.891 --> 39:55.959
EVERYBODY'S LOVE STORY
IS DIFFERENT, NORMAN,

39:55.961 --> 39:58.495
AND SOMETIMES,
THEY JUST TAKE TIME.

39:59.530 --> 40:02.098
A LOT OF TIME.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.133
CHEER UP, RITA.

40:03.135 --> 40:06.136
THERE'S A TIME
TO WRITE STORIES

40:06.138 --> 40:08.938
AND THERE'S A TIME
TO LIVE YOUR OWN.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.974
AND A TIME
TO DANCE.

40:12.042 --> 40:16.079
YES. A TIME TO DANCE.

40:25.055 --> 40:26.423
[EXHALES TENSELY]

40:26.425 --> 40:28.458
THIS IS A BIG MISTAKE.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.860
I ASSURE YOU,
MS. McINERNEY,

40:30.862 --> 40:33.163
YOU WILL SOON
DISCOVER THE BENEFITS

40:33.165 --> 40:34.864
OF RECREATIONAL DANCE
TO YOUR HEALTH

40:34.866 --> 40:36.800
AND YOUR SENSE
OF WELL-BEING,

40:36.802 --> 40:39.102
BUT WILL YOU BE ABLE
TO LAST A FULL HOUR

40:39.104 --> 40:41.204
WITHOUT YOUR PRECIOUS INTERNET?

40:41.206 --> 40:43.206
HA, HA. VERY FUNNY.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.842
[CHUCKLES]

40:45.844 --> 40:47.877
[♪]

40:47.879 --> 40:49.179
THEY'RE ALL SO GOOD!

40:49.181 --> 40:51.047
I-I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.115
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.683
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.051
WHAT?

40:55.053 --> 40:57.754
[♪]

40:57.756 --> 40:58.888
DON'T LOOK DOWN.
