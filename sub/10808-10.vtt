00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.548
Hi, Mrs. Cooper.

01:21.548 --> 01:23.183
This is Jeanette at Sentinel.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.619
Well, it looks like you
let another month slip by

01:25.619 --> 01:27.121
without sending in your payment.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.486
Shame, shame.

01:29.890 --> 01:33.127
Ch, of course I know you're home
on disability.

01:33.127 --> 01:35.396
Of course I know you've got
doctor bills,

01:35.396 --> 01:39.633
but you have also got
very good medical insurance!

01:39.633 --> 01:40.634
Oh, come on, hon.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.636
Now, why don't you just do
a little bit

01:42.636 --> 01:43.737
to carry your own weight?

01:43.737 --> 01:45.039
After all, this is America.

01:45.039 --> 01:47.041
We've got all these
opportunities, all this freedom.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.776
We also have
certain obligations,

01:48.776 --> 01:50.911
and this is one
of your obligations

01:50.911 --> 01:52.179
as a good citizen.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.114
I'll call you back tomorrow
at 4:00.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.649
I'll call at 5:00,

01:55.649 --> 01:58.413
and please don't let this go
to litigation.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.488
Well, if you won't send in
your payment,

02:01.488 --> 02:04.158
you'll be forcing me
to get the courts involved.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.260
That could be very ugly.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.829
Fine. Have your money for me
by tomorrow.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.059
Okay, bye-bye.

02:14.201 --> 02:17.404
Cooper case,
telephone call number ten,

02:17.404 --> 02:20.396
4:32 p.m., August first.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.278
0h, Mr. Clark, hello!

02:24.278 --> 02:26.680
This is Jeanette at Sentinel.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.383
l have got good news for you!

02:29.383 --> 02:31.051
Yes, at my urging...

02:31.051 --> 02:35.055
Good! And send
those checks in today.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.758
You know how forgetful
you can be!

02:37.758 --> 02:40.761
My pleasure! Bye-bye!

02:40.761 --> 02:43.195
(phone rings)

02:43.764 --> 02:44.598
Hello.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.899
Hi, Jeanette, it's Bill.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.735
Just checking in
on my favorite new worker.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.566
How are things going?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.239
J ust g reat.

02:52.239 --> 02:54.475
0h, bottom line,
New York is the place to be

02:54.475 --> 02:56.543
if you want to make a killing
in today's market.

02:56.543 --> 02:59.279
If I was good in Louisville,
just watch my dust here!

02:59.279 --> 03:01.115
What?

03:01.115 --> 03:02.349
Friends?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.618
No, not just yet.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.887
I will get out and meet people.
Stop fussing.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.522
Listen, Bill, I need more

03:08.522 --> 03:10.457
of those litigation
form letters.

03:10.457 --> 03:13.227
I know we never sue,
but we can threaten.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.629
Those letters work wonders
on some of these clients.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.930
Guess what?

03:16.930 --> 03:19.500
I got that old hick Mr. Clark
on postdated checks!

03:19.500 --> 03:21.001
0h, ljust know
he's so forgetful.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.036
The first check of his
I deposit is gonna bounce

03:23.036 --> 03:24.471
right to Canada.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.673
Then I'm gonna go after him
for check fraud.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.208
Oh, it always works.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.944
Listen, Bill,
can we talk commission?

03:30.944 --> 03:33.247
I really think that I'm...

03:33.247 --> 03:36.183
What? Oh... sure.

03:36.183 --> 03:39.753
Uh, when you free up,
can you call me back?

03:39.753 --> 03:42.089
Today?

03:42.089 --> 03:44.558
Even tonight's okay.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.095
Sure. Don't forget me.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.392
Bye.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.562
Hello, Mary Jane.
Is your mommy home?

03:57.271 --> 03:58.272
She's not?

03:58.272 --> 04:00.474
Oh, that's too bad.

04:00.474 --> 04:04.545
Well, you know,
she's in trouble.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.814
No, don't cry, Mary Jane.

04:06.814 --> 04:10.584
No, I don't want
your mommy to go to jail either.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.353
$51 is such a tiny amount.

04:13.353 --> 04:14.755
For grownups, I mean.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.456
How? You do?

04:16.456 --> 04:18.392
Oh, for college.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.160
(phone rings)

04:20.160 --> 04:23.964
Hmm. No, Mary Jane,
you keep your money for school.

04:23.964 --> 04:28.035
But you tell your mommy
to call me right away, okay?

04:28.035 --> 04:29.403
(ringing continues)

04:29.403 --> 04:30.427
Bye-bye.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.607
Yes, hello.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.709
WOMAN:
Hello? Hello?

04:35.709 --> 04:36.710
Who is this?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.645
WOMAN:
My payment overdue...

04:38.645 --> 04:39.746
What payment?

04:39.746 --> 04:42.883
WOMAN:
lt's Rita Valdez, Miss Simpson.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.484
JEANETTE:
This is a private line.

04:44.484 --> 04:45.886
This number is unlisted.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.821
Do not call me ever again,
whoever you are.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.288
(tapping keys)

04:58.532 --> 05:00.466
(phone ringing)

05:03.437 --> 05:04.605
Yes?

05:04.605 --> 05:08.175
RITA:
It's so lonely and cold here.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.978
So dark and alone.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.180
Payment overdue.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.410
I must make my payment.

05:19.253 --> 05:21.388
Yes, Bill-- deceased.
As in dead.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.890
I don't like pranks, Bill.

05:22.890 --> 05:26.159
Some goon in your office has
given out my private number.

05:26.159 --> 05:26.994
(intercom beeps)

05:26.994 --> 05:27.995
(stammers)

05:27.995 --> 05:30.464
Well, maybe this dead person
knows somebody in your office

05:30.464 --> 05:32.599
who's a cleaning lady. I...

05:32.599 --> 05:34.067
Yes, Charles?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.569
CHARLES:
A Mr. Michael Nelson

05:35.569 --> 05:38.405
from City Welfare has something
for you, Miss.

05:38.405 --> 05:39.573
Well, send him up.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.574
Yes, Miss.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.777
What if this prankster
knows where | live?

05:43.777 --> 05:45.212
This is New York.

05:45.212 --> 05:48.882
People get killed
for a subway token in this town.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.852
Well, could you
check on it, please?

05:51.852 --> 05:55.188
Suddenly, I don't feel safe
in my own apartment.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.024
And this place
is like a fortress.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.659
(doorbell rings)

05:58.659 --> 06:00.650
Good-bye, Bill.

06:04.564 --> 06:07.367
Uh... Uh, Jeanette Simpson?

06:07.367 --> 06:10.938
Uh, l'm Michael Nelson
from the city.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.506
Come in.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.736
Oh. Thank you.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.273
Oh, my.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.114
Oh, would you just feel that?

06:21.114 --> 06:22.849
Must be central
air-conditioning.

06:22.849 --> 06:26.019
Ah, you don't get this kind
of cooling from window units.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.155
It's a studio,
but it has the luxuries.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.356
Ooh, and a view.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.491
Every unit at the Suffolk
has a view.

06:31.491 --> 06:32.726
Is that the park?

06:32.726 --> 06:34.528
And the museum.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.363
Yes.
What is it you have for me?

06:36.363 --> 06:38.695
Um, a payment.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.369
To settle the account
of Rita Valdez.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.670
Now, wait a minute.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.501
First a phone call,
and now a check?

06:46.540 --> 06:47.541
Phone call?

06:47.541 --> 06:50.210
Did someone call from the city?

06:50.210 --> 06:53.043
No. Forget it.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.150
Shall we step
into the living area?

06:57.150 --> 06:58.552
Oh.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.786
lt's lovely.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.617
Thank you.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.194
You see, Miss Valdez
was one of my cases--

07:07.194 --> 07:08.562
uh, welfare cases--

07:08.562 --> 07:10.964
and it has fallen to me
to settle her affairs.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.265
Oh, she died. You knew?

07:12.265 --> 07:13.600
-lt's in the computer.
-Yeah.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.969
Fell orjumped, perhaps,
from her sixth-floor apartment.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.137
It was tragic.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.106
Made it all the way
from El Salvador

07:19.106 --> 07:21.375
just to die on a sidewalk
in the Bronx.

07:21.375 --> 07:22.943
Illegal alien?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.111
No, no. Political refugee.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.512
Her husband was sentenced
to death

07:25.512 --> 07:26.913
down there by a high judge,

07:26.913 --> 07:29.483
and she remained terrified
ofjudges or courts,

07:29.483 --> 07:31.585
or even the law,
right up to the end.

07:31.585 --> 07:32.919
Fascinating, I'm sure.

07:32.919 --> 07:35.188
Has this got anything
to do with me?

07:35.188 --> 07:36.857
Well, Rita made me promise
to bring you this,

07:36.857 --> 07:39.018
from her insurance policy,
to settle things.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.124
Why did shejump?

07:43.163 --> 07:44.631
Despair.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.099
Or pain.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.534
She had a brain tumor.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.436
Such hallucinations.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.238
All we found
in her little tenement was,

07:51.238 --> 07:52.606
uh, that new washer and dryer

07:52.606 --> 07:54.041
she bought to take in laundry,

07:54.041 --> 07:57.210
a table, a chair and, uh...
the phone... off the hook.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.370
Here.

08:05.719 --> 08:06.520
(laughs)

08:06.520 --> 08:09.189
Oh, she was very superstitious.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.892
That's, uh... That's supposed
to be a guardian angel, someone

08:11.892 --> 08:13.360
to protect you
when you're on earth

08:13.360 --> 08:15.695
and balance things out
when you die.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.097
Balance what things?

08:17.097 --> 08:19.466
Well, the things between here
and the next place.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.468
You know, if someone had harmed
Rita terribly,

08:21.468 --> 08:24.071
this angel's supposed
to come back and even the score.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.940
Oh, please-- I don't take things
from dead people.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.241
But I promised.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.377
As she lay crumpled
on the sidewalk, I promised.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.245
That's your problem, not mine.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.647
(sighs)
These poor people.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.315
If you only knew.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.584
JEANETTE: Maybe I know better
than you think.

08:37.584 --> 08:39.519
(rock music playing)

08:39.519 --> 08:40.884
Know what better?

08:42.422 --> 08:44.758
Well, I wasn't born
with central air-conditioning

08:44.758 --> 08:46.626
and a view of the park, no.

08:46.626 --> 08:49.096
I had to pull myself up
on my own,

08:49.096 --> 08:51.565
climb up, brick by brick,
and on my way,

08:51.565 --> 08:54.501
I learned
there are no real sad stories--

08:54.501 --> 08:56.670
only leeches, pretending.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.639
And I learned not to get
involved with any of them.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.334
And how did you learn that?

09:02.375 --> 09:04.978
By marrying a real bum.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.646
Only for a year.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.949
Oh, he would have been thrilled
to see you.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.952
There was nothing he loved more
than his welfare check,

09:11.952 --> 09:15.555
a fifth of whiskey and me
to kick around for the night.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.182
I'm so sorry.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.187
I had it coming.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.296
Daddy told me.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.665
There are two kinds
of people in this world--

09:25.665 --> 09:27.667
doers and takers.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.503
And it's the job of the doers

09:29.503 --> 09:31.605
not to get taken in
by the takers.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.173
Not everyone is a taker.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.508
These people | work with--

09:34.508 --> 09:36.042
they're in such
pitiable conditions.

09:36.042 --> 09:38.245
A condition that you could
get yourself out of

09:38.245 --> 09:41.548
if you were in it,
because you are a doer.

09:41.548 --> 09:45.152
Don't be suckered in so easily.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.520
I know these types.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.088
I hear their tales of woe.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.657
(scoffs)
I swear to God,

09:50.657 --> 09:52.859
you put me in any one
of their places,

09:52.859 --> 09:55.262
and I could work my way out
in no time.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.564
I would get help,
and I would get out.

09:57.564 --> 09:58.899
You would?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.800
Yes. I would.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.791
(phone ringing)

10:07.574 --> 10:09.409
Hello?

10:09.409 --> 10:11.411
Now, you stop this.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.280
This is nuts.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.582
Don't you ever call
this number again.

10:15.582 --> 10:18.919
I know the law, and I know
how to get the police involved.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.251
(sighs)
Goodness.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.158
Some crank.

10:25.158 --> 10:28.195
Some awful person is trying
to scare me.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.595
But why? How?

10:34.601 --> 10:37.270
Out there in thatjumble
of buildings

10:37.270 --> 10:40.273
in some cement cubicle,

10:40.273 --> 10:42.008
someone is calling

10:42.008 --> 10:44.943
and pretending
to be someone who's dead.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.739
Who wants to hurt me?

10:50.784 --> 10:53.014
l have no idea.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.859
Please...

10:59.859 --> 11:01.850
stay to dinner?

11:08.735 --> 11:10.737
MICHAEL:
Chocolate mousse.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.136
Goodness.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.207
Mmm.

11:19.879 --> 11:23.717
You have a very special quality.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.219
You make me feel...

11:26.219 --> 11:29.222
well... safe.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.053
From the phone caller?

11:35.095 --> 11:37.097
Not just that.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.088
Everything.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.602
There.

11:42.602 --> 11:43.637
There you are.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.472
Time for sleepy dreams.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.973
(phone rings)

11:46.973 --> 11:48.975
Oh, no.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.966
(ringing continues)

11:53.213 --> 11:55.215
Hello.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.716
Yes, now, listen here.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.385
Do not call this number again.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.720
You're causing great discomfort.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.389
No, I will not stand for it.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.380
No, that is all.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.495
Did they say who it was?

12:08.495 --> 12:09.829
A man. "Bill" he said.

12:09.829 --> 12:11.331
Is that your crank caller?

12:11.331 --> 12:12.666
(laughing):
No.

12:12.666 --> 12:14.334
-Bill is my boss.
-Oh!

12:14.334 --> 12:15.535
Sorry.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.703
No, don't be.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.171
You were wonderful.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.372
Why don't you stay?

12:19.372 --> 12:20.740
Stay?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.310
W-Well, l-l'm not
propositioning you or anything.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.712
It's just-- if you could stay,
even for a little,

12:25.712 --> 12:26.913
till-till I fall asleep.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.149
I'm just so jittery tonight.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.818
Well... maybe I'll, uh...

12:31.818 --> 12:34.821
I can relax on the covers here.

12:34.821 --> 12:35.889
(sighs)

12:35.889 --> 12:37.880
Just for a little while.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.550
(phone rings)

12:47.100 --> 12:48.101
Hello?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.936
RITA:
It's so cold...

12:49.936 --> 12:52.962
and lonely here.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.849
So lonely here.

13:02.849 --> 13:04.984
Sola.

13:04.984 --> 13:07.320
Lonely here.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.356
Sola.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.358
So...

13:11.358 --> 13:14.661
The scores must be even.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.730
Must be even.

13:16.730 --> 13:19.733
The scores must be even.

13:19.733 --> 13:22.235
Must be even!

13:22.235 --> 13:25.505
Must be even...!

13:25.505 --> 13:27.496
Must be even!

13:30.076 --> 13:32.169
The score...

13:33.179 --> 13:36.082
My payment.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.752
It's overdue.

13:38.752 --> 13:40.743
-(bashing)
-lt's overdue.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.382
...payment overdue.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.021
It's overdue.

13:51.865 --> 13:55.902
Where is my angel?

13:55.902 --> 13:57.637
Where is my angel?

13:57.637 --> 14:00.874
Where is Michael?

14:00.874 --> 14:03.443
Michael...

14:03.443 --> 14:05.078
Michael...!

14:05.078 --> 14:06.841
Michael!

14:15.488 --> 14:17.319
Michael!

14:19.359 --> 14:21.156
(QTOQQHW
Hmm?

14:31.571 --> 14:33.606
What's all the mess?

14:33.606 --> 14:37.444
Look, if you're in on it,
just tell me what you want.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.745
In on what?

14:38.745 --> 14:40.747
This Rita game.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.349
The last call, the caller
mentioned your name.

14:43.349 --> 14:45.885
Now, I don't believe
that the dead can talk.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.354
But I do believe that there are
some among the living

14:48.354 --> 14:50.056
who can be very cruel.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.992
But why would anyone want
to be cruel to you?

14:52.992 --> 14:55.028
Well, if they thought that I had

14:55.028 --> 14:57.030
something to do
with someone's bad luck--

14:57.030 --> 15:00.033
like this Rita's dying
or something-- I don't know.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.234
But you didn't.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.635
Right?

15:02.635 --> 15:05.772
I didn't bring that Rita
any more problems

15:05.772 --> 15:07.807
than she had created on her own.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.798
Good.

15:11.945 --> 15:15.782
Then let's get this settled
once and for all.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.951
Your last call to Rita,
when was it?

15:17.951 --> 15:19.452
I don't know.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.187
-Won't your computer have it?
-No.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.883
Sure, it will.
Come on.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.993
Let's get the information.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.561
Come on.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.553
You'll rest much easier when you
see that you're not responsible.

15:43.042 --> 15:44.077
Ah.

15:44.077 --> 15:47.514
Rita Valdez, last call July 10.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.516
I sometimes record my calls.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.351
And you recorded your last call
to Rita.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.685
Perfect.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.020
Now, where's the tape?

15:54.020 --> 15:56.011
I'm not sure.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.886
Is this the one?

16:03.897 --> 16:06.092
I cut the wires.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.298
Well, I'm pretty handy
with these things.

16:23.716 --> 16:24.584
RITA:
gAlo?

16:24.584 --> 16:26.286
It's Jeanette at Sentinel.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.321
Do you have a payment
for me yet?

16:28.321 --> 16:29.422
RITA:
No entiendo.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.658
Uh, sorry, my-my English.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.427
They sometimes say they don't
speak English, but they all do.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.762
-Really.
-Really?

16:35.762 --> 16:38.064
Miss Valdez, it has
been three months.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.800
RITA:
Please, l-l so sick.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.368
JEANETTE:
Your payment is overdue.

16:42.368 --> 16:43.703
You must make your payment.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.573
RITA:
My head, it-it hurts so bad.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.242
JEANETTE: I'm afraid I have to
put your case up for litigation.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.778
RITA:
Please, the words-- too big.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.813
We never really sue.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.815
It means you have
to go to court.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.016
See the judge.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.852
RITA:
No! No! No! Judge kills.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.155
JEANETTE: Someone from a court
of law will call you soon.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.624
RITA: The courts,
they kill, and my head...

17:04.624 --> 17:05.625
(dial tone)

17:05.625 --> 17:09.152
JEANETTE:
Call to Valdez, July 10, 4:15.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.867
Now, how was I supposed to know
that she was really sick,

17:14.867 --> 17:16.869
or what a judge meant to her?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.071
How?

17:18.071 --> 17:24.377
You could've asked.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.980
Are you saying... that l...?

17:26.980 --> 17:28.743
No. You just didn't listen.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.010
Not a grave sin.
Not normally.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.254
Uh, now wait a minute.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.390
You are not myjudge orjury.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.026
I'm sorry, but I am.

17:40.026 --> 17:44.263
Things must be balanced,
so the dead can rest.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.766
Rita must rest.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.035
I am getting the doorman.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.265
Please don't fight.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.140
MICHAEL:
Don't fight.

17:54.140 --> 17:57.143
It's gonna hurt enough
without the fighting.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.145
Charles?

17:59.145 --> 18:01.147
-Char|es!
-R|TA: Did my payment arrive?

18:01.147 --> 18:03.316
ls Michael there?

18:03.316 --> 18:05.318
-¢'Alo?
-What do you want, money?

18:05.318 --> 18:09.152
You know, Rita never
had air-conditioning.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.361
And it got so hot in there.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.363
Especially in the daytime.

18:17.363 --> 18:20.366
(Jeanette gasps)

18:20.366 --> 18:21.601
Oh, and the lovely view.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.770
No... No, she had
a sixth-floor view

18:23.770 --> 18:26.439
of the back of a sewage plant.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.274
(Jeanette gasping)

18:28.274 --> 18:31.310
All day, all night,
such ugly street noises.

18:31.310 --> 18:34.447
(subway train passing)

18:34.447 --> 18:36.315
Oh.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.340
No, no nice furniture.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.855
No, nothing at all.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.550
(jackhammer pounding outside)

18:47.627 --> 18:50.897
But she did have that.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.433
And she had that
new washer-dryer.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.669
Took in neighbors' laundry
for a living.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.671
You're behind in your payments.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.673
But you said you could catch up.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.675
No, this is a trick.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.844
Some kind of hallucination.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.679
You've hypnotized me,
haven't you?

19:06.679 --> 19:09.182
No, wait--
I remember her hair.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.550
It wasn't like that.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.218
And that nice robe.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.220
No, no, it was more like...

19:14.220 --> 19:16.211
that.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.027
No.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.029
It's impossible.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.530
You've drugged me.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.599
You've made me see things
that aren't there-- stop it.

19:26.599 --> 19:30.570
No... no, Rita...
Rita couldn't speak like that.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.572
Come here.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.005
Let me show you.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.182
What happen?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.717
I no understand.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.321
l Jeanette.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.489
I no talk like this.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.723
I'm not Spanish!

19:50.723 --> 19:52.692
Somebody help.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.726
Of course.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.489
I'll help you.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.699
I've been assigned
to your case, after all.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.701
(gasping)

20:01.701 --> 20:03.703
You trick me.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.706
I no can be like this.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.907
This is trick.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.909
You trick me!

20:09.909 --> 20:12.241
Oh, and this.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.238
(groans)

20:18.384 --> 20:20.375
Oh, it hurt.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.725
Oh, it... it beating...

20:25.725 --> 20:26.926
inside...

20:26.926 --> 20:30.229
I know... I'm so sorry.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.232
(phone rings)

20:33.232 --> 20:34.734
Must be for you.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.736
Go on, answer it--
I'm right here.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.727
(ringing continues)

20:41.107 --> 20:42.942
gAlo?

20:42.942 --> 20:46.746
Miss Valdez, this is Jeanette
at Sentinel Collection.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.081
Your payments on that washer
and dryer are way overdue.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.652
And I need to knowjust what you
intend to do about that.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.154
Miss Valdez?

20:55.154 --> 20:58.157
Answer me.

20:58.157 --> 21:01.394
Answer me right now, or I will
have to take drastic measures.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.624
I will have
to get the courts involved.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.767
Answer me...

21:07.767 --> 21:09.234
Answer me!

21:19.412 --> 21:23.216
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:23.216 --> 21:25.751
Waiting for us to enter.

21:25.751 --> 21:28.988
Waiting to enter us.

21:28.988 --> 21:35.223
Until next time,
try to enjoy the daylight.
