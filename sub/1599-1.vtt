00:15.850 --> 00:18.017
Nancy:
<i>Oh, look.</i>

00:18.019 --> 00:20.152
Rachel berry was
great on broadway

00:20.154 --> 00:22.855
And maybe she
can work on tv,

00:22.857 --> 00:24.723
But the show and her performance

00:24.725 --> 00:26.859
Is the kind of thing
that ends careers,

00:26.861 --> 00:28.193
Not starts them.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.628
I said i only wanted
to hear the good ones.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.063
Well, that was
a good one.

00:31.065 --> 00:33.532
It says maybe
you can work in tv.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.801
Rachel, it's lee.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.002
Oh, i'm sorry.

00:37.004 --> 00:38.570
Nancy: Hi.
I've met you before. Nancy.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.205
Hi.
Yes. You know, um...

00:40.207 --> 00:41.640
I'm a publicist.
Oh...

00:41.642 --> 00:42.975
And, uh, give me
a buzz, okay?

00:42.977 --> 00:44.143
Okay. Well, thank you for this.
Rachel.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.045
Lee:
Congratulations on that baby.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.548
Yeah.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.418
(sighs)

00:52.420 --> 00:54.486
Rachel, i have
some bad news.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.055
I have been fired.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.658
Apparently, i was right

00:59.660 --> 01:02.694
That people want to see
live tv shows...

01:02.696 --> 01:03.829
Just not this one.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.697
I think we are
the first show

01:05.699 --> 01:08.534
In history to get a zero share.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.235
Well, do you think that
if we can get more people

01:10.237 --> 01:11.437
To watch the
second episode...

01:11.439 --> 01:14.373
If we were to do
another episode,

01:14.375 --> 01:17.009
There would be protestors
from unicef,

01:17.011 --> 01:19.678
The adl, the naacp,

01:19.680 --> 01:21.914
Peta...
I mean, my blackberry

01:21.916 --> 01:24.450
Is buzzing with angry e-mails
from nambla.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.186
I think that you
actually found a way

01:27.188 --> 01:29.755
To offend every
special interest group

01:29.757 --> 01:31.256
In this country.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.392
And i don't want to point
fingers, but i have to.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.893
At you, because
you're the face of it.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.195
Okay?

01:36.197 --> 01:38.430
I don't know what i'm gonna do.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.099
I've got two families to feed.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.700
Actually, i do know
what i'm gonna do.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.169
I'm just gonna end up
running another network.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.773
Mr. Paulblatt,
i'm... I'm so sorry.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.075
I... I can't imagine
how you feel.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.277
Oh, well, you should, be...

01:52.279 --> 01:53.912
Because you're also fired.

01:53.914 --> 01:56.148
<i>That's so rachel</i>
has been canceled.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.150
Oh, my...

01:58.152 --> 02:00.419
(laughs): I'm not the only one
going down with this ship.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.421
No. I mean, unlike me,

02:02.423 --> 02:05.124
I would highly doubt that you
ever work in television again.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.492
That's so rude.
I shouldn't have said that.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.926
Not "highly doubt."
i'd be surprised.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.161
Not "surprised."
floored.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.562
Wh... I'm...

02:10.564 --> 02:12.397
What-what am i supposed to do?

02:12.399 --> 02:15.734
Do what everyone
who just failed miserably does:

02:15.736 --> 02:18.270
Blame everyone else.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.340
And then go home.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.781
I don't even know
where that is anymore.

02:29.783 --> 02:33.085

Baby.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.982
(chuckles)

05:16.984 --> 05:18.984
Oh, thank god.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.819
What's going on?
Where's dad?

05:21.622 --> 05:23.255
Sweetie...

05:31.665 --> 05:33.699
Dad and i are
getting divorced.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.634
What?

05:35.636 --> 05:36.668
N... No.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.203
No, this isn't happening.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.971
Oh, my god, i feel like i died
and now i'm in hell.

05:39.973 --> 05:43.442
It's been bad
for a long time.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.778
We agreed to wait
to tell you

05:46.780 --> 05:48.680
Until you came out of seclusion.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.449
You had enough on your plate.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.053
I'll tell you more
over dinner.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.524
I, um...

06:01.328 --> 06:03.695
I don't know how long
i'm gonna be staying.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.063
Is that all right?

06:05.065 --> 06:08.300
You can stay with me
as long as you want.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.303
But we put the house
on the market

06:11.305 --> 06:12.637
A couple weeks ago.

06:16.477 --> 06:20.412
They say you have
to lose everything...

06:20.414 --> 06:22.814
Before you can really
find yourself.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.986
Rachel:
One soy latte, please.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.322
Oh, my god,

06:30.324 --> 06:32.657
It's william mckinley's
own rachel berry!

06:32.659 --> 06:34.826
Oh, no, my god.
No, please. No. Shh.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.528
You can't hide from me.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.598
I work here now, since sue
cut my janitor's wages.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.666
Oh, this soy latte's on me,
rachel berry.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.235
Thank you so much.
May i please have my card back?

06:43.237 --> 06:44.503
No matter how bad
things have been for me,

06:44.505 --> 06:46.605
But your humiliation
makes me see

06:46.607 --> 06:47.906
That things can
always get worse.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.175
That's terrible.
Gratitude.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.911
Great. Well, might as well
just take all this off now.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.079
What was that?
You know,

06:54.081 --> 06:55.947
It's just the story of my life.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.916
All i've ever wanted
is to come home

06:57.918 --> 06:59.251
And have everyone know my name,

06:59.253 --> 07:00.952
And now they do,
but only because

07:00.954 --> 07:04.790
I was involved in the worst
television show in history.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.726
No one has heard
from you in months.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.594
Well, that's because
i went into hiding.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.962
Yeah.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.597
But you know, i'm good now.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.132
I'm good, and...

07:14.134 --> 07:18.203
I'm getting my life
back together and...

07:18.205 --> 07:20.338
And everything is good.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.543
Well, i'm gonna help you
figure this out.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.244
Thanks.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.480
I just...

07:28.482 --> 07:29.981
I don't understand.
Why are you back?

07:29.983 --> 07:32.117
Are you visiting
family? Where's kurt?

07:32.119 --> 07:35.487
Uh... Wow, you really
have been in hiding.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.755
Uh...

07:36.757 --> 07:38.290
Rach, kurt and i broke up.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.458
What?

07:39.460 --> 07:41.927
Yeah, it got pretty rough

07:41.929 --> 07:43.929
After everyone left
and it was just

07:43.931 --> 07:46.131
Him and me
alone in the loft.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.067
I guess we're "too young."

07:49.069 --> 07:50.936
Everybody says this is
exactly what happens

07:50.938 --> 07:52.304
To high school relationships

07:52.306 --> 07:54.439
After the first year
of college, but i...

07:54.441 --> 07:55.607
I thought we were different.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.442
I'm really sorry.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.611
I got super depressed

07:59.613 --> 08:03.281
After we broke up, and, uh...

08:03.283 --> 08:06.351
My schoolwork sort of
started to slip

08:06.353 --> 08:08.453
And i got cut from nyada.

08:08.455 --> 08:10.956
What?

08:10.958 --> 08:13.592
Uh... When are you gonna
go back to new york?

08:13.594 --> 08:15.026
I think i'm gonna take
a little break.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.028
I wanted to
be home, too.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.163
Yeah.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.698
I moved in back
with my parents.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.099
And i-i got a job.
At dalton.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.702
I am the new coach
for the warblers.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.338
But you don't... You don't need
a college degree for that?

08:26.340 --> 08:27.873
Well, i'm not a real teacher,

08:27.875 --> 08:29.508
But the faculty advisor
got ebola or something,

08:29.510 --> 08:32.010
So the timing
was perfect.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.478
You know what?

08:33.480 --> 08:34.679
I think we need to make
a promise to each other.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.449
I think that,
from here on out,

08:37.451 --> 08:39.618
It's you and me,
together,

08:39.620 --> 08:42.487
And we are gonna turn
these lemons into lemonade.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.055
Okay?

08:44.057 --> 08:45.056
All right.

(students screaming)

12:18.238 --> 12:19.671
<i>My crowning achievement?</i>

12:19.673 --> 12:22.107
<i>Getting rid of that glee club.</i>

12:22.109 --> 12:23.775
<i>Making sure that every last one</i>

12:23.777 --> 12:25.410
<i>Of those sitter-diddled</i>
<i>transvestites</i>

12:25.412 --> 12:27.746
<i>Were forcibly transferred</i>
<i>to other schools</i>

12:27.748 --> 12:30.682
<i>And converting this place</i>
<i>into the beehive of learning</i>

12:30.684 --> 12:33.051
<i>It is today.</i>

12:33.053 --> 12:35.253
<i>Heck, i even got william</i>
<i>that job at carmel high</i>

12:35.255 --> 12:39.290
<i>To assure myself nothing</i>
<i>but blissful night's sleeps.</i>

12:39.292 --> 12:41.392
<i>Look at this place.</i>

12:41.394 --> 12:43.061
<i>I'm helping to create</i>

12:43.063 --> 12:45.530
<i>The next great innovators</i>
<i>in this country.</i>

12:45.532 --> 12:47.565
<i>You know why america's</i>
<i>falling behind?</i>

12:47.567 --> 12:50.368
<i>Because every kid thinks</i>
<i>they should be a rap mogul</i>

12:50.370 --> 12:52.604
<i>Or a movie star.</i>

12:52.606 --> 12:56.608
Yes, young man whose name
i will never care to know,

12:56.610 --> 12:59.043
If there's one thing
i am most proud of,

12:59.045 --> 13:02.547
It's the fact that i have
proven, once and for all,

13:02.549 --> 13:05.784
Young minds do not need
the humanities...

13:05.786 --> 13:07.819
Or the arts.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.454
(chuckles)

13:20.801 --> 13:22.167
Kurt:
<i>I'll admit it.</i>

13:22.169 --> 13:23.835
<i>It's been a rough few months.</i>

13:23.837 --> 13:26.304
<i>But all things considered,</i>
<i>i'm feeling okay.</i>

13:26.306 --> 13:28.573
<i>Year three of nyada</i>
<i>is about to start,</i>

13:28.575 --> 13:30.408
<i>And that means</i>
<i>work-study program.</i>

13:30.410 --> 13:33.077
<i>In year three,</i>
<i>all students are required</i>

13:33.079 --> 13:35.313
<i>To go out into the world</i>
<i>and hone their craft</i>

13:35.315 --> 13:36.748
<i>As pseudo-professionals.</i>

13:36.750 --> 13:38.349
<i>We're encouraged</i>
<i>to be creative,</i>

13:38.351 --> 13:40.652
<i>Get out of new york,</i>
<i>shake things up.</i>

13:40.654 --> 13:43.288
<i>I'm lucky because i've already</i>
<i>secured my internship</i>

13:43.290 --> 13:45.156
<i>At the</i>
<i>lexington retirement home,</i>

13:45.158 --> 13:46.858
<i>Where i will spend a year</i>
<i>directing a stage production</i>

13:46.860 --> 13:48.860
<i>Of</i> the real housewives
<i>that i wrote myself.</i>

13:48.862 --> 13:50.328
All right.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.696
<i>And speaking</i>
<i>of shaking things up,</i>

13:51.698 --> 13:53.464
<i>Since i broke up with blaine,</i>

13:53.466 --> 13:55.767
<i>I haven't been seeing anyone</i>
<i>out of respect to him,</i>

13:55.769 --> 13:58.803
<i>But i finally decided</i>
<i>to take the plunge.</i>

13:58.805 --> 14:00.772
<i>I got on tindr, and i signed up</i>

14:00.774 --> 14:02.340
<i>For an afternoon</i>
<i>of speed dating.</i>
(dings)

14:02.342 --> 14:04.475
Hi, i'm rich.
(dings)

14:04.477 --> 14:05.710
I'm barry.
My name's john.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.212
Kurt.
(dings)

14:07.214 --> 14:09.647
I do pirate reenactments
and i'm also a psychic.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.216
(dings)
i am an accountant by day,

14:11.218 --> 14:13.484
And by night,
i am also an accountant.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.320
To pay the rent, i work
at a mediterranean-themed

14:15.322 --> 14:16.788
Vegan restaurant for pets.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.656
I'm getting something.
I sense that

14:18.658 --> 14:19.791
You just broke up with someone.

14:19.793 --> 14:20.892
That-that's amazing.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.293
Uh, i-i did.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.363
I-i was actually engaged.
Uh, he asked me.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.232
I-i feel like that's important
for people to know,

14:27.234 --> 14:28.833
But i'm the one
who called it off.

14:28.835 --> 14:31.336
Yeah, he-he's a great guy,
and if i learned...

14:31.338 --> 14:34.239
Wait, you haven't dated
since you broke up, have you?

14:34.241 --> 14:36.574
Wow, you are psychic.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.042
I don't need
to be a psychic to tell

14:38.044 --> 14:39.377
That you're not over this dude.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.983
We're going up against
mr. Shue at sectionals,

14:44.985 --> 14:46.818
So i could really use
whatever notes you have

14:46.820 --> 14:48.019
On how the warblers
are doing.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.487
You really don't
want my notes.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.322
I won the gold star
at the loser olympics.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.192
You can flame out as
spectacularly as you want on tv,

14:54.194 --> 14:55.560
But you're still
rachel berry,

14:55.562 --> 14:57.262
And rachel berry is
a show choir genius.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.265

to ed sheeran's "sing")

17:11.398 --> 17:14.065
(laughs):
Oh, my god.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.301
(exhales)
so, um, any thoughts?

17:17.303 --> 17:18.870
Oh, my gosh,
well, i have three.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.638
First of all,
that was incredible.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.473
Second of all,
you're way past the maximum age

17:22.475 --> 17:24.142
To be dancing and singing
with these guys.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.343
(laughter)

17:25.345 --> 17:27.678
And third, thank you.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.013
That was the first time
i've laughed

17:29.015 --> 17:30.415
And smiled
in a really long time.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.582
Of course.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.184
(whistle blows)
come on, let's go!

17:33.186 --> 17:34.752
My grandma's got one leg,

17:34.754 --> 17:36.954
And she can run
faster than that! Go!

17:39.259 --> 17:41.092
(whistle blowing)

17:41.094 --> 17:43.494
I need water.
Get it yourself.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.663
Could you stop being
such a whiny hummel

17:45.665 --> 17:48.332
And get back in there?

17:48.334 --> 17:49.934
Um, excuse me, i haven't
been out of this school

17:49.936 --> 17:51.502
For that long,
but when i was here,

17:51.504 --> 17:53.171
We worked really hard
to make sure bullies like you

17:53.173 --> 17:54.205
Don't use words like that.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.373
Rachel, no, it's cool.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.541
Spencer is totally gay.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.176
Kind of a
post-modern gay teen.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.710
You see, positive
representations of gays

17:59.712 --> 18:01.579
In the mass media has given me
the confidence

18:01.581 --> 18:03.081
I need to be myself,

18:03.083 --> 18:06.417
Which, turns out,
is kind of an arrogant jerk.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.119
Oh, and your show sucked.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.088
(gasps)
isn't he a sweetheart?

18:10.090 --> 18:12.356
You're gonna let him
disrespect you like that?

18:12.358 --> 18:15.093
Look, like i said, rachel, okay,
i'm the assistant coach, okay?

18:15.095 --> 18:16.360
I can't yell at them
like coach beiste.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.096
Come on! If salmon had legs,

18:18.098 --> 18:20.264
We'd have it for dinner,
not breakfast!

18:20.266 --> 18:22.066
Okay, these guys
are really good.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.201
Yeah, they are.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.436
Yeah, sue, uh,
spent the offseason

18:25.438 --> 18:26.971
Recruiting players
from all over the state.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.539
She actually bought a, uh,
apartment complex

18:28.541 --> 18:30.108
And moved
all the families into.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.242
I think it's legal.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.877
What about the arts?

18:32.879 --> 18:34.779
What about music and painting?
I mean, it's not right.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.714
What about the kids
that don't play sports?

18:36.716 --> 18:38.883
Look, rachel,
i agree with you, okay?

18:38.885 --> 18:41.152
If you have a problem,
just take it up with sue.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.622
(sighs)

18:44.624 --> 18:46.491
Can i help you?

18:47.961 --> 18:49.660
I'm here to speak
with sue sylvester.

18:49.662 --> 18:50.995
Sue:
It's okay, janet.

18:50.997 --> 18:51.429
Let her in.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.502
Janet is part
of the free labor arrangement

18:57.504 --> 19:01.172
I have with the ohio
department of corrections.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.807
She's a convicted counterfeiter.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.343
But don't worry,
she's chained to the desk.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.916
Congratulations, btw.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.418
The, uh, humiliating
public nature

19:14.420 --> 19:18.122
Of your epic flame out
exceeded my expectations

19:18.124 --> 19:19.423
In a major way.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.792
Look, i'm not here
to talk about me.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.494
I'm here to talk
about the glee club.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.795
Well, there is no glee club.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.030
In fact, i exterminated

19:26.032 --> 19:27.598
All the arts programs
at this school.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.468
You can't deprive these kids
an education

19:30.470 --> 19:32.436
In music and theater.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.006
Oh, i can and i did.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.507
And it is about you, rachel.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.510
You were the very best
the arts had to offer.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.446
Which means the arts, clearly,

19:42.448 --> 19:45.082
Don't have much to offer,
now do they?

19:46.719 --> 19:49.120
There is no glee club
at this school.

19:49.122 --> 19:52.957
There will never be a glee club
at this school

19:52.959 --> 19:54.525
As long as i'm in charge.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.194
Now get the hell
out of my office

19:56.196 --> 19:58.162
Before i sic
a convicted felon on you.

19:58.164 --> 20:00.531
I've been watching her
out of the corner of my eye

20:00.533 --> 20:02.066
For the last few minutes.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.870
I'm pretty sure
she's fashioning a shiv.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.273
(school bell ringing)

20:14.547 --> 20:16.147
You want to order?

20:16.149 --> 20:17.415
Uh, no, i'll wait.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.783
Uh, hot date.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.426
(thunder rumbling)

20:32.665 --> 20:34.665
Hi. Sorry.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.901
I know i'm a little late,
but it's really coming down,

20:36.903 --> 20:38.536
And i also had to stop by
the mercer kitchen

20:38.538 --> 20:39.604
Just to check on something.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.172
You're never gonna guess.

20:41.174 --> 20:45.176
So, it turns out that
they are totally available

20:45.178 --> 20:47.678
On labor day for our wedding.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.914
(panting)

20:52.518 --> 20:54.885
Why am i always
the first one to arrive?

20:54.887 --> 20:56.854
Um, did you not hear
what i just said?

20:56.856 --> 20:58.889
They're available
for the wedding on labor day.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.592
Okay, let's-let's just order.
I'm starving.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.363
I don't want to fight
about this,

21:05.365 --> 21:07.765
But i really feel like the whole
wedding planning thing,

21:07.767 --> 21:09.800
It's just all falling on me.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.606
What's the matter?

21:15.608 --> 21:18.142
Tell me. Are...

21:18.144 --> 21:19.877
Are you having second thoughts?

21:19.879 --> 21:23.814
Have you noticed
how exhausting it's been

21:23.816 --> 21:25.583
Ever since you moved back in?

21:25.585 --> 21:26.917
The other day,

21:26.919 --> 21:29.720
We got into a three-hour fight

21:29.722 --> 21:33.257
Because i used a towel
to wipe off my mouth

21:33.259 --> 21:35.726
While there was still toothpaste
on my face.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.094
Well, how is someone else
supposed

21:37.096 --> 21:38.663
To use it
when you leave it like that?

21:38.665 --> 21:40.965
Living together is
supposed to be a trial run,

21:40.967 --> 21:43.134
And i got to tell you,
i think we are failing it.

21:43.136 --> 21:46.003
Thank you for finally
saying something truthful.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.171
Where's that guy been?

21:47.173 --> 21:48.306
Huh? Where have you been?

21:48.308 --> 21:49.807
You've been
completely aloof

21:49.809 --> 21:51.609
And totally remote
and distant.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.110
It's like i don't even
know you anymore.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.746
I feel like you're just
silently judging me.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.281
What do you even
want anymore?

21:57.283 --> 21:58.849
Do you even want
this wedding?

21:58.851 --> 22:00.451
Do you even want to marry me?

22:00.453 --> 22:02.753
Maybe i don't!

22:10.496 --> 22:12.730
What changed?

22:15.168 --> 22:18.169
Was it something that i did?

22:18.171 --> 22:20.171
Because...

22:20.173 --> 22:22.707
Because you know...

22:22.709 --> 22:24.675
I love you. I love you so much.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.811
And i-i know that we can
make this work.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.780
I love you, too.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.049
But w-we're kids.

22:34.954 --> 22:37.888
Look.

22:37.890 --> 22:43.060
We had a great run,
but let's... Just call it quits

22:43.062 --> 22:45.763
Before we completely
hate each other.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.712
I will never
forgive you for this.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.481
Man:
Kurt hummel?

23:03.483 --> 23:04.815
Hey.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.317
I'm ricardo.

23:06.319 --> 23:09.353
Sorry to keep you waiting.
My spin class ran late.

23:09.355 --> 23:10.588
I...

23:10.590 --> 23:13.457
Are you okay?

23:15.995 --> 23:17.428
I-i'm sorry.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.963
I have to go.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.835
Will:
Bop, bop, bop, bop.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.170
Bop-bop, bop, tsa-tsa-tsa.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.171
(baby giggles)

23:27.173 --> 23:29.073
Thoughts?

23:29.075 --> 23:30.741
Come on, danny, pay attention.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.444
You're the only person i trust
to show this stuff to.

23:33.446 --> 23:35.613
See, vocal adrenaline is not
like the new directions!

23:35.615 --> 23:39.049
They're all about precision
and big dance ensembles.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.584
Perfection.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.219
Can't rely on my old tricks
if i want

23:42.221 --> 23:44.255
To get us a win at sectionals,
which means...

23:44.257 --> 23:46.590
No waiting
till the last minute,

23:46.592 --> 23:48.726
No mercedes
to park and bark,

23:48.728 --> 23:52.062
And (sighs) no journey.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.431
(sighs)

23:53.433 --> 23:55.433
What i need to know
is if i'm crazy

23:55.435 --> 23:57.568
For considering having
the entire team do

23:57.570 --> 23:59.036
A synchronized
backflip.

23:59.038 --> 23:59.904
(whoops)

23:59.906 --> 24:01.372
Ha!
(baby giggles)

24:01.374 --> 24:04.108
(laughs)

24:04.110 --> 24:05.810
Oh, why do i worry
about anything

24:05.812 --> 24:08.312
When i get to come home every
night and see that face?

24:08.314 --> 24:10.648
(cooing)

24:10.650 --> 24:13.184
Come on, you want to learn
some of daddy's dance moves?

24:15.321 --> 24:16.987
Here we go, you ready?

24:16.989 --> 24:18.989
You ready?

24:18.991 --> 24:20.591
A five, six, seven, eight.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.092
¶<i> bop, ba-dop</i> ¶

24:22.094 --> 24:24.094

25:17.016 --> 25:21.552

25:21.554 --> 25:24.021
All right!

25:24.023 --> 25:26.357
Great job, guys.
It's, uh, it's getting better.

25:26.359 --> 25:30.227
Remember,
my office door is always open

25:30.229 --> 25:32.696
If any of you have
any problems, so, um...

25:36.202 --> 25:38.168
Am i dreaming?

25:38.170 --> 25:40.371
Is that star of stage
and screen rachel berry?

25:40.373 --> 25:43.874
I think the correct term is
"unhireable."

25:43.876 --> 25:45.910
Come on,
your show wasn't that bad.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.946
I actually liked, um...
A-a bunch of it.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.149
(whispers):
You're a terrible liar.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.852
No, i've just always
seen the best in you.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.488
When i was in high school and
everyone thought i was a loser,

25:57.490 --> 25:59.390
I knew that one day i
would have the chance

25:59.392 --> 26:01.225
To show them the truth.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.661
And, well, i got my shot, and
all i did was prove them right.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.362
That was just
one misstep, rachel.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.264
Yeah, well, that's really
all you get these days.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.566
No, i don't
believe that.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.067
I mean, there's always
something else,

26:10.069 --> 26:11.835
Especially for someone
as talented as you are.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.938
I mean, look at me.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.239
Here.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.575
Yeah, i lost the
new directions!

26:17.577 --> 26:20.010
But now i'm coaching the most
famous glee club in the world.

26:20.012 --> 26:22.580
Yeah, which i have some pretty
strong feelings about.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.081
I wanted to keep coaching,

26:24.083 --> 26:25.416
And mckinley doesn't have
a glee club anymore.

26:25.418 --> 26:27.318
Well, that never
stopped you before.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.188
I don't have any fight
left in me, rachel.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.856
I have a baby,
and, uh...

26:32.858 --> 26:35.426
And carmel pays five times
what mckinley did.

26:35.428 --> 26:39.063
This is a good thing.

26:39.065 --> 26:42.099
Besides, it's not like any
of you guys are there anymore.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.537
Well...
No, don't, please.

26:46.539 --> 26:48.472
Don't give me some speech

26:48.474 --> 26:51.442
About being a part of something
special makes you special,

26:51.444 --> 26:54.211
And that i should just
believe in myself,

26:54.213 --> 26:57.114
Because we're way past that.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.749
How about this?

26:58.751 --> 27:00.784
Have you ever seen a guy
shoot a bow and arrow?

27:00.786 --> 27:02.086
(chuckles) when would
i have seen that?

27:02.088 --> 27:03.387
(laughs)

27:03.389 --> 27:05.656
Okay, well, here-here it is.

27:05.658 --> 27:08.292
The power is created by
the bending of the bow, okay?

27:08.294 --> 27:10.327
So-so the more...
The more the bow bends,

27:10.329 --> 27:13.664
The more potential energy
is created.

27:13.666 --> 27:17.134
Life's challenges are just
the bending of the bow.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.669
No, think about it.
Okay.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.604
The bigger the challenge,
the more the bow bends,

27:20.606 --> 27:23.173
The more potential you create
to do something amazing.
Right.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.776
All you have to do
is just...

27:25.778 --> 27:27.911
Find a purpose.
(laughs)

27:27.913 --> 27:30.447
Find the arrow that you're
gonna put in that bow.

27:30.449 --> 27:31.749
(laughs):
Okay.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.817
You still got it.
I still got it!

27:33.819 --> 27:35.853
(both laugh)
oh, my god.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.988
No.
Well, the only difference

27:37.990 --> 27:41.191
With my situation is that
the bow didn't just bend,

27:41.193 --> 27:43.427
It broke.

27:53.539 --> 27:55.639
What's going on?
We're here for an intervention.

27:55.641 --> 27:57.107
Rachel, we want
to help you.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.676
Will:
We are gonna watch

27:58.678 --> 28:00.277
<i>That's so rachel.</i>

28:00.279 --> 28:02.112
(chuckles):
On, no. No, we're not.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.515
No, we're not, you guys.
No, no,
i think it's time.

28:04.517 --> 28:05.983
I think you're ready
to face your fears.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.551
Um, no,
i-i don't think so, blaine.

28:07.553 --> 28:09.386
Until you sit and watch
<i>that's so rachel</i>

28:09.388 --> 28:11.121
And realize
it really wasn't that bad,

28:11.123 --> 28:12.523
You're never gonna get over it.

28:12.525 --> 28:15.025
Is this really happening
right now?
Mm-hmm.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.361
(exhales)
here we go.
Oh, my god, you guys.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.063
Rachel (on video):
I am so tired

28:19.065 --> 28:20.464
From that train ride
from ohio.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.466
Oh, thank heavens
i inherited this loft

28:22.468 --> 28:24.735
From my two dead
gay grandmothers.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.570
(laugh track laughter)

28:26.572 --> 28:28.472
Looks just like your
apartment. It's nice.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.240
Rachel, look!

28:30.242 --> 28:32.409
(gasps)
it's my grandmothers... S'

28:32.411 --> 28:34.244
Purple piano!

28:34.246 --> 28:36.747
I learned how to
play on this!

28:36.749 --> 28:38.849
Uh, excuse me?
(laugh track laughter continues)

28:38.851 --> 28:40.150
That's<i> my</i> piano.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.752
It came with the apartment.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.754
Wait. Someone else
lives here?

28:43.756 --> 28:45.222
That's right.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.924
I'm nittany cuthbert,
oh, my god.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.692
And this is infiniti domingo.
It's uncanny.

28:48.694 --> 28:50.360
I feel like i can't breathe.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.595
What y'all doing

28:51.597 --> 28:53.831
In the apartment
we bought two years ago?

28:53.833 --> 28:55.999
And i'm blartie,
and i live here, too.

28:56.001 --> 28:58.202
(laughter)

28:58.204 --> 29:01.071
I knew it was
too good to be true.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.307
¶ ¶

29:06.579 --> 29:09.179
(crowd cheering)

29:09.181 --> 29:10.447
It's so horrible!

29:10.449 --> 29:12.349
No, it's not that bad.
Blaine.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.851
It's horrible.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.019
Nittany: Here, rachel.
I thought these guys

29:16.021 --> 29:18.088
Could help you
with your audition for<i> cats.</i>

29:18.090 --> 29:20.858
Oh, the cats! The cats were
the worst part, you guys.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.893
They have cancer.

29:22.895 --> 29:26.196
Ugh! And then they started
spraying everywhere.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.298
(cats yowling)
cert! Where
have you been?

29:28.300 --> 29:31.735
Let's just say i fed
my worm to a warbler.

29:31.737 --> 29:33.604
(laugh track laughter)

29:33.606 --> 29:35.405
He is so funny.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.142
Come here, kitty. Ah.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.078
(cat screeches)
(all gasp)

29:41.080 --> 29:42.546
Oh, my god.
Nailed him.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.481
(cats yowling)
it looks like cert forgot

29:44.483 --> 29:47.751
To take his narcolepsy medicine.
(chuckles)

29:47.753 --> 29:49.319
He'll be fine.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.821
I thought you were
gonna be singing.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.489
Where's the singing?
Well, they cut it.

29:52.491 --> 29:55.058
Gosh, rachel,
new york is the worst.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.427
Even the muggers
have muggers.
Well, what happened?

29:57.429 --> 30:01.064
I was... I was...
Robbed at gunpoint,

30:01.066 --> 30:02.800
And... Paralyzed in fear.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.301
And i'm paralyzed.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.804
Anyway, rachel...

30:06.806 --> 30:08.338
Line!

30:08.340 --> 30:11.608
Okay, uh, mr. Shue,
can we just please pause it?

30:11.610 --> 30:13.076
I-i can't watch anymore.

30:13.078 --> 30:14.578
I get it. Like...
All right.

30:14.580 --> 30:15.946
Please.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.348
(sighs)

30:18.350 --> 30:20.017
I think it's
charming.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.419
It's a monstrosity.
Oh, you're right.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.922
I mean, this isn't the beginning
that you had hoped for,

30:24.924 --> 30:27.491
But it is... Still
a beginning.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.928
And since when are you a girl
who does it the easy way?

30:30.930 --> 30:33.797
Will: It's just a tv show;
it's not who you are.

30:33.799 --> 30:36.266
I mean, you're not gonna
be defined by this failure.

30:36.268 --> 30:37.668
The future will judge you

30:37.670 --> 30:40.204
Based on what you do
to come back from it.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.180
Look, i know
you've been through this

30:50.182 --> 30:51.815
With sue sylvester,
but she's wrong.

30:51.817 --> 30:54.318
Depriving a student an education
in the arts is so...

30:54.320 --> 30:55.652
I agree.

30:55.654 --> 30:58.856
I think the arts are
extremely important.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.625
<i>But</i> unfortunately,
the principals are

31:01.627 --> 31:03.160
In charge of the schools.

31:03.162 --> 31:06.363
Right, but aren't you in charge
of the principals?

31:07.700 --> 31:10.200
Even if i wanted to go
over sue sylvester's head

31:10.202 --> 31:11.702
And reinstate
the glee club,

31:11.704 --> 31:13.804
It would be impossible
at this point.

31:13.806 --> 31:15.706
The budget's already
been set for the year,

31:15.708 --> 31:18.675
And there is no money
for any new programs.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.677
What if i gave the money?

31:20.679 --> 31:22.813
I-i have some left over
from<i> that's so rachel.</i>

31:22.815 --> 31:25.182
It's not much,
but i'd be willing to donate it

31:25.184 --> 31:27.150
If it meant bringing back
the glee club.

31:27.152 --> 31:28.719
Hmm.

31:32.358 --> 31:33.991
(chuckles):
You know...

31:33.993 --> 31:36.360
I have to admit, i...

31:36.362 --> 31:39.730
Wouldn't mind seeing sue
sylvester taken down a peg.

31:39.732 --> 31:43.400
I mean, the grades are up, but
i'm not sure about the caning.

31:43.402 --> 31:47.004
I have a sneaking suspicion
she's angling for my job.

31:47.006 --> 31:48.839
That would not surprise me.

31:49.675 --> 31:51.008
All right.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.442
You've got a deal.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.678
On one condition.
Okay.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.381
You run it.
Excuse me?

31:57.383 --> 31:59.349
I don't know, rachel,
you seem like

31:59.351 --> 32:01.418
The perfect candidate to me.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.493
Hey, rachel.

32:19.905 --> 32:21.538
(sighs)

32:26.779 --> 32:28.712
I showed up.
Six months ago, you said

32:28.714 --> 32:31.381
That we would all meet
at that spot outside the loft,

32:31.383 --> 32:32.783
'cause no matter what,
our friendships

32:32.785 --> 32:34.151
Were the most important thing.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.422
(siren wailing in distance)

32:38.424 --> 32:40.657
(thunder rumbling softly)

32:45.431 --> 32:48.131
Well, i was the only one
who showed up.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.167
And you were clearly
in the midst

32:50.169 --> 32:52.169
Of a nervous
breakdown. And...

32:52.171 --> 32:54.338
Well, blaine...

32:54.340 --> 32:56.139
Well, i-i blew it.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.608
I blew the best thing
that ever happened to me.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.510
Are you sure
you're not just saying that

33:00.512 --> 33:02.646
Because you're lonely?
I mean, new york must feel

33:02.648 --> 33:04.514
Pretty empty
without all of us there.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.583
No.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.119
Blaine's the love of my life.

33:09.121 --> 33:10.487
I started seeing this therapist

33:10.489 --> 33:12.489
Who said that i have
this thing with love.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.624
You know, men fight as a way

33:14.626 --> 33:17.861
To stay connected, but
blaine wasn't like that.

33:17.863 --> 33:20.697
He wasn't afraid of intimacy.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.701
H-has he said anything?

33:24.703 --> 33:28.005
H-he seems to be
in a good place about it.

33:28.007 --> 33:29.373
Well, that's great.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.108
Well, m-maybe i can fix it.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.877
Do you think you can arrange
a meeting between he and i

33:33.879 --> 33:36.013
In-in a neutral place
somewhere here in lima?

33:36.015 --> 33:37.681
Uh, i'm confused.

33:37.683 --> 33:40.217
How do you plan
to fix things long distance?

33:40.219 --> 33:42.219
Well...

33:42.221 --> 33:44.654
Maybe it doesn't have
to be long distance.

33:44.656 --> 33:47.190
Look, i... I want to
be here with you guys.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.059
You've got to help me.

33:49.061 --> 33:52.396
Maybe we can have our
redemption here together.

33:57.202 --> 34:00.037
I think i have the perfect idea.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.206
Thank you so much, gentlemen.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.008
Rachel: Yeah, we know
that in the past

34:05.010 --> 34:07.077
The glee club and the av club
have had friendly relations,

34:07.079 --> 34:09.513
And we plan to keep that intact.

34:09.515 --> 34:11.648
And we promise
to learn your names, yes.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.150
And that goes for the band, too.

34:22.428 --> 34:23.894
What is this?

34:23.896 --> 34:25.662
We're bringing back
the glee club.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.931
I went over your head and
got express written consent

34:27.933 --> 34:29.566
From the superintendent,
and there is

34:29.568 --> 34:31.168
Nothing you can
do to stop us.

34:31.170 --> 34:32.936
Let me get this straight.

34:32.938 --> 34:35.038
The superintendent gave you
permission to demolish

34:35.040 --> 34:39.543
A state-of-the-art computer lab
to make room for a glee club.

34:39.545 --> 34:43.513
He may have been aware
that this was a computer lab.

34:43.515 --> 34:46.283
And who will be running
this glee club?

34:46.285 --> 34:47.717
You, rachel?

34:47.719 --> 34:49.419
And me.

34:49.421 --> 34:52.255
It's part of my third-year
work-study program at nyada.

34:52.257 --> 34:55.425
Okay, well, i have to, uh, admit
i'm surprised at the speed

34:55.427 --> 35:00.030
With which two of the glee
club's more promising graduates

35:00.032 --> 35:02.566
Have tucked their tails
between their legs

35:02.568 --> 35:04.434
And slinked back to high school.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.037
While i'm always tickled

35:07.039 --> 35:09.606
At the sheer novelty of having
a middle-sex like porcelain,

35:09.608 --> 35:11.908
'cause it's just so
whimsical to talk

35:11.910 --> 35:13.110
To somebody who looks and sounds

35:13.112 --> 35:14.978
So much like
a gay cartoon walrus,

35:14.980 --> 35:15.946
You,

35:15.948 --> 35:17.914
Rachel berry,

35:17.916 --> 35:19.282
Well, you crossed a line.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.918
I don't appreciate
being told off.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.087
And when we met up in new york,

35:24.089 --> 35:26.323
You insulted me
in front of my beau.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.258
Simply because i flew
a thousand miles

35:28.260 --> 35:29.759
To be at your
opening night

35:29.761 --> 35:31.394
So i could walk out
in the middle

35:31.396 --> 35:33.230
And have sex all over
your apartment.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.732
And then you do this.

35:37.736 --> 35:42.172
You two have just entered
sue sylvester's thunderdome.

35:42.174 --> 35:44.107
And i will show you no mercy,

35:44.109 --> 35:45.976
Give no quarter,
and my battle

35:45.978 --> 35:47.811
With will schuester
will look like

35:47.813 --> 35:50.680
Two adorable little baby pandas
play wrestling

35:50.682 --> 35:54.651
In comparison to what i'm going
to unleash on both of you.

35:56.088 --> 35:58.355
You will beg for death.

35:59.258 --> 36:01.424
But it will not come.

36:01.426 --> 36:02.859
You think you bottomed out

36:02.861 --> 36:05.795
With that abomination
of a tv show you ran?

36:05.797 --> 36:08.932
No, rachel berry,
your national nightmare

36:08.934 --> 36:12.035
Has just...

36:12.037 --> 36:13.837
Begun.

36:18.877 --> 36:21.111
(sniffing)

36:21.113 --> 36:23.180
You smell like a nursing home.

36:31.390 --> 36:34.057
¶ ¶

36:41.233 --> 36:43.466
(school bell ringing)

36:48.073 --> 36:49.639
Kurt:
<i>Just be cool.</i>

36:49.641 --> 36:51.841
<i>Keep your words</i>
<i>as straight as an arrow.</i>

36:51.843 --> 36:53.376
Blaine:
Hi!

36:53.378 --> 36:54.844
I hope you weren't
waiting long.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.513
Uh, no, no. H-hi!

36:56.515 --> 36:58.048
Hi. Hello.
(chuckles nervously)

36:58.050 --> 36:59.983
Hi. Hi.

37:01.186 --> 37:03.820
Um, i-i appreciate
you coming to see me.

37:03.822 --> 37:06.489
I-i would understand if you
had told me to screw off.

37:06.491 --> 37:08.825
No! No, no.
I-i've wanted to see you, uh...

37:08.827 --> 37:10.894
Well, i-i'm here
to get you back.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.896
I-i don't mean
to blurt it out like that,

37:12.898 --> 37:16.066
But f-for the sake of clarity,
you should know that first

37:16.068 --> 37:17.534
I'm going to get
your forgiveness,

37:17.536 --> 37:21.004
And-and then
i'm gonna get your heart back.

37:23.075 --> 37:26.509
Um... I'm seeing someone.

37:26.511 --> 37:28.912
<i>Don't cry. Be cool.</i>

37:28.914 --> 37:31.348
<i>Smile, oh, god.</i>
<i>I'm gonna be sick.</i>

37:31.350 --> 37:35.385
And i... I wanted
to tell you in person,

37:35.387 --> 37:37.587
Especially because you know him.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.289
<i>Please don't say</i>
<i>sebastian smythe.</i>

37:39.291 --> 37:41.524
Hey, kurt!

37:52.638 --> 37:54.070
Karofsky.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.939
I knew this would be a
little weird for you.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.407
Kurt:
<i>It's a living nightmare!</i>

37:57.409 --> 37:58.942
What? No, it's-it's
not weird at all.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.378
No. Uh, so how'd you two
meet up again?

38:01.380 --> 38:04.080
Well, um, it was actually just
a few months ago, right here

38:04.082 --> 38:05.382
As a matter of fact.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.584
(men whooping)
<i>i was a little bored,</i>

38:07.586 --> 38:09.419
<i>So i decided to come</i>
<i>to country bear nights</i>

38:09.421 --> 38:11.821
<i>Here at scandals,</i>
<i>and there was dave</i>

38:11.823 --> 38:13.823
<i>Doing the electric slide.</i>

38:13.825 --> 38:16.059
¶ ¶

38:19.498 --> 38:21.064
Fun!
(laughs)

38:21.066 --> 38:22.499
Yeah.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.901
We got to talking,
mostly... Mostly about you.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.737
I was just so angry
with what had happened,

38:27.739 --> 38:30.240
And it was just me venting
about the breakup.

38:30.242 --> 38:32.609
(stammers)
but i reminded him,

38:32.611 --> 38:33.977
You know, how much
you helped me

38:33.979 --> 38:35.478
During that dark time
in my life.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.681
And, uh, just, you know,
you forgave me

38:37.683 --> 38:39.849
For all the crap
i put you through.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.085
Blaine:
Anyway, we got to talking,

38:42.087 --> 38:45.121
Hanging out, and...

38:45.123 --> 38:46.423
Here we are.

38:46.425 --> 38:47.624
Here we are.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.326
Yogi and boo boo.

38:49.328 --> 38:51.661
That's his nickname for us
'cause i'm his big bear

38:51.663 --> 38:53.196
And he's my little cub.

38:53.198 --> 38:54.597
Kurt:
<i>Ugh! I'm gonna be sick!</i>

38:54.599 --> 38:56.299
<i>I'm gonna throw up!</i>

38:56.301 --> 38:59.302
<i>And when did blaine</i>
<i>start liking bears?!</i>

38:59.304 --> 39:01.805
I know this isn't
what you wanted.

39:01.807 --> 39:04.774
And i know this isn't gonna
be easy, but i just wanted

39:04.776 --> 39:07.277
All of us to be able
to be adults about this.

39:07.279 --> 39:09.713
And i'm hoping
we can be friends.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.981
You know, we can
all hang out and stuff.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.050
(laughs)
sounds like fun.

39:14.052 --> 39:17.687
Um, if-if you'd excuse me,
i have to use the restroom.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.759
(panting slowly)

39:49.154 --> 39:51.721
Perfect.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.156
Definitely want this.

39:53.158 --> 39:54.657
Put it right there.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.659
(knocking)

39:58.497 --> 40:00.530
I always thought one day
finn would take this place over.

40:00.532 --> 40:02.532
Yeah, well, it's just
for a couple months

40:02.534 --> 40:04.267
Till i get my feet
on the ground.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.236
You know what that means yet?

40:06.238 --> 40:09.205
Broadway.
It was always my dream.

40:09.207 --> 40:11.040
Still is.

40:11.042 --> 40:14.344
I had it once and i lost it,
but i'm gonna get it back.

40:14.346 --> 40:16.713
So... Don't bet against me.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.748
I never have and i never will.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.685
I, um...
Wanted to bring you something.

40:28.693 --> 40:31.261
Think it belongs right here.

40:32.964 --> 40:35.465
And just
a little friendly reminder,

40:35.467 --> 40:37.734
You're gonna be facing
off against blaine

40:37.736 --> 40:39.636
And me at sectionals, so, um,

40:39.638 --> 40:41.571
I think it's time
to start recruiting.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.907
Yeah.

40:43.909 --> 40:47.177
I think
you're gonna like it here.

41:42.634 --> 41:45.702
¶ let it go, let it go ¶

41:45.704 --> 41:49.472
¶ can't hold it back anymore ¶

41:49.474 --> 41:52.809
¶ let it go, let it go ¶

41:52.811 --> 41:56.779
¶ turn away and slam the door ¶

41:56.781 --> 41:59.682
¶ i don't care ¶

41:59.684 --> 42:03.286
¶ what they're going to say ¶

42:03.288 --> 42:07.023
¶ let the storm rage on ¶

42:07.025 --> 42:11.361
¶ the cold never bothered me
anyway ¶

42:14.666 --> 42:17.333
¶ it's funny how some distance ¶

42:17.335 --> 42:20.904
¶ makes everything seem small ¶

42:20.906 --> 42:24.474
¶ and the fears
that once controlled me ¶

42:24.476 --> 42:28.578
¶ can't get to me at all ¶

42:28.580 --> 42:32.215
¶ it's time to see
what i can do ¶

42:32.217 --> 42:35.852
¶ to test the limits
and break through ¶

42:35.854 --> 42:39.923
¶ no right, no wrong,
no rules for me ¶

42:39.925 --> 42:43.693
¶ i'm free ¶

42:43.695 --> 42:47.030
¶ let it go, let it go ¶

42:47.032 --> 42:50.700
¶ i'm one
with the wind and sky ¶

42:50.702 --> 42:54.070
¶ let it go, let it go ¶

42:54.072 --> 42:58.174
¶ you'll never see me cry ¶

42:58.176 --> 43:00.843
¶ here i stand ¶

43:00.845 --> 43:06.282
¶ in the light of day ¶

43:06.284 --> 43:12.322
¶ let the storm rage on... ¶

43:16.094 --> 43:17.961
The cold never
bothered me anyway.

43:17.963 --> 43:20.096
