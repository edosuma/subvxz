00:08.166 --> 00:09.916
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL LOVE STORY

00:15.333 --> 00:22.333
SEVEN MINUTES IN THE PRESENT
AND FOUR MINUTES IN THE PAST

00:42.750 --> 00:43.625
Fuck.

01:04.583 --> 01:05.625
They sent you?

01:06.333 --> 01:07.666
I just finished my shift.

01:08.375 --> 01:09.458
Those are the pills.

01:09.958 --> 01:12.916
I also brought you a spray
and cream for the itching.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.208
Okay.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.791
Call me if you need anything.
I had chickenpox as a kid.

01:17.375 --> 01:18.208
Thanks.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.208
We'll only stay for a little bit.

01:44.083 --> 01:45.333
-Hi.
-Oh, hi…

01:45.416 --> 01:46.708
God, you look awful.

01:46.791 --> 01:47.666
A bit, yes.

01:48.166 --> 01:51.375
Why don't you stand behind the door?
I'm not sure if I had it.

01:52.166 --> 01:53.458
-Okay.
-Sorry.

01:53.541 --> 01:54.875
No, it's okay.

01:58.500 --> 02:02.666
We made you some soup. I'll leave it here.
Grab it when we leave, okay?

02:02.750 --> 02:03.583
Okay.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.625
How are you?

02:06.208 --> 02:08.666
Well, I'm covered in bumps.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.708
-And does it itch a lot?
-Yeah.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.625
Do you have a fever?

02:14.125 --> 02:15.250
Yes, that too.

02:15.333 --> 02:19.125
Do you have bumps on your tongue?
My mom said you can even get them there.

02:19.208 --> 02:22.208
-Yes.
-Well, watch a series, a movie.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.208
Keep yourself distracted. Okay?

02:25.458 --> 02:26.291
Yes.

02:27.041 --> 02:28.250
What's wrong?

02:28.958 --> 02:31.500
Nothing, it's just that…
It hurts even when I speak.

02:33.166 --> 02:34.958
She's a mess. She's not doing well.

02:35.041 --> 02:36.541
-What are you going to do?
-What?

02:37.041 --> 02:40.125
-What are you going to do?
-We're going to have a drink.

02:41.666 --> 02:42.833
Have fun.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.166
Pedro, you go ahead.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.666
-You sure?
-Yes, go ahead. I'll stay for a bit.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.875
-I'll see you later, okay?
-Okay.

02:50.958 --> 02:52.375
-Sorry.
-Bye, Lina.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.375
Lini?

02:55.208 --> 02:59.125
-What?
-It's like a flashback from Sunday school.

02:59.208 --> 03:00.791
This whole thing with the door.

03:01.625 --> 03:05.541
I always confessed the same thing.
I said that I fought with my sister.

03:07.458 --> 03:11.000
I always made something up.
I didn't want to tell the truth.

03:11.708 --> 03:12.541
Yeah.

03:17.958 --> 03:19.291
I'm not doing well, Inés.

03:22.375 --> 03:24.291
-Lina?
-I'm down here.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.708
I just realized that we aren't…

03:31.708 --> 03:33.000
That this is real.

03:34.541 --> 03:36.375
That we aren't getting back together.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.333
And…

03:42.916 --> 03:45.166
And the truth is, I don't know what to do.

03:48.291 --> 03:50.916
I miss the time when I was happy, and…

03:52.583 --> 03:53.833
That's gone now.

03:53.916 --> 03:56.083
It hasn't been very long, Lini.

03:56.166 --> 03:57.458
This is normal.

03:57.541 --> 04:00.625
Little by little, you'll start
feeling better. You'll recover.

04:01.125 --> 04:02.750
Just take it easy, okay?

04:03.583 --> 04:05.791
We were together for years, and…

04:07.458 --> 04:09.541
We've been through so much that…

04:10.958 --> 04:12.708
I'm always thinking about it and…

04:13.750 --> 04:16.250
I keep remembering,
and thinking about it all…

04:23.625 --> 04:25.125
-Don't cry.
-I can't.

04:25.208 --> 04:26.041
No.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.083
Everyone leaves in the end, Inés.

04:38.375 --> 04:39.208
Lini…

04:39.708 --> 04:41.041
Open the door, come on.

04:41.708 --> 04:43.416
I don't know. And I also think,

04:44.458 --> 04:49.375
"Maybe it's me. There must be…
something wrong with me." You know?

04:49.458 --> 04:51.625
Don't say that.
There's nothing wrong with you.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.083
There's nothing wrong with you.
I'm here with you. Okay?

04:55.166 --> 04:57.083
I'm here. Listen. Hi!

04:58.041 --> 04:58.916
You're so silly.

05:00.750 --> 05:04.083
Calm down. There's nothing wrong with you.

05:48.875 --> 05:51.166
Ready, set…

05:51.833 --> 05:53.916
Pedal fast.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Well done, Lina! Come on!

05:57.125 --> 05:58.125
Pedal hard!

05:58.791 --> 06:01.208
You let me go!

06:01.791 --> 06:04.750
But you let go of me!

06:04.833 --> 06:06.083
But you did it.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.541
You let go of me!

06:09.208 --> 06:12.791
-You did it for two seconds.
-But you let me go!

06:12.875 --> 06:14.125
It's okay.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.041
-Wave at Dad, over there, to the camera.
-No.

06:18.666 --> 06:21.166
-Not to the camera.
-Okay.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.208
-I really hurt myself.
-Where?

06:23.291 --> 06:24.666
On my butt!

06:24.750 --> 06:27.083
-On your butt?
-Yes!

06:28.333 --> 06:30.500
You're okay.

06:30.583 --> 06:34.000
If we fall again, what do we have to do?
We try again. Okay?

06:34.666 --> 06:36.833
-Can we go back there now?
-Sure.

06:36.916 --> 06:38.958
And if we fall again, what will we do?

06:39.041 --> 06:41.416
-We'll get back on the bike…
-And try again!

06:41.500 --> 06:42.875
That's the right attitude!

07:45.375 --> 07:46.291
Are you hungry?

07:52.125 --> 07:52.958
Yes.

07:56.541 --> 07:57.375
Shall we?

07:57.875 --> 07:59.500
I don't know what I want.

08:01.875 --> 08:03.000
Some croquettes?

08:03.083 --> 08:04.791
Hi. Ready to order?

08:05.416 --> 08:07.625
No. What do you recommend?

08:07.708 --> 08:09.291
Well, what would you like?

08:10.875 --> 08:12.291
Something for a special day.

08:12.875 --> 08:13.708
Okay.

08:14.291 --> 08:16.541
-Okay--
-We're all dressed up and everything.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.291
-Yes.
-We've come straight from church.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.583
-Okay.
-We want a real feast.

08:22.833 --> 08:26.458
Well, we have a two-pound rib-eye steak.
It's perfect for two.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
We also have some wild sea bass,
it came in today and it's delicious.

08:31.083 --> 08:32.500
What about the special menu?

08:33.458 --> 08:36.291
We have a special menu
for weddings and first communions.

08:38.875 --> 08:43.000
And can you make it a special menu
for burials and funerals?

08:45.333 --> 08:46.250
Oh.

08:46.333 --> 08:47.625
Well…

08:48.125 --> 08:49.041
I'll ask.

08:57.708 --> 08:58.750
Bathroom break.

09:22.875 --> 09:23.708
Nico?

09:36.500 --> 09:37.416
How did you do it?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.208
I remember that,

09:47.833 --> 09:51.166
right after my mom died,
I went on the end-of-year trip.

09:52.375 --> 09:55.375
And while I was there,
it felt like time stood still.

09:56.458 --> 09:58.208
I couldn't stop thinking about her.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.000
And the good memories

10:00.583 --> 10:02.083
made me feel sad, and

10:03.291 --> 10:05.333
the bad ones made me feel even sadder.

10:07.750 --> 10:10.250
People kept telling me
it was all a matter of time.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.416
That I had to hang in there.

10:15.083 --> 10:16.708
But the months went by and…

10:18.791 --> 10:21.791
in the end, I realized I was the one
who wasn't letting time go by.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.250
So I decided to start thinking about her.

10:32.208 --> 10:33.833
I'd think about things like when

10:34.416 --> 10:37.916
she'd wake me up in the morning
and her hands smelled like cigarettes.

10:41.083 --> 10:43.583
Or when she would sing to me
just to annoy me,

10:43.666 --> 10:45.166
because she knew I hated it.

10:49.458 --> 10:51.833
But every day,
I'd think of her one minute less.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.625
And that would make
one minute less of sorrow.

11:01.375 --> 11:02.833
You never told me about that.

11:06.708 --> 11:07.916
Because I had forgotten.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.333
THIS SERIES IS A WORK OF FICTION.
