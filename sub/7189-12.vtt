WEBVTT

00:03.044 --> 00:03.836
- Hey, thanks
for helping me search.

00:03.920 --> 00:06.089
- I'll make my posters tonight.

00:06.172 --> 00:07.340
- You might want to go easier
on the glitter.

00:07.424 --> 00:10.844
- Hey, the more noticeable,
the better, right?

00:10.927 --> 00:12.137
- You're right.
I-I take it back.

00:12.220 --> 00:13.471
Glitter your heart out.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.683
Hey, um,

00:16.766 --> 00:18.309
you want to walk together
to school on Monday?

00:23.565 --> 00:25.275
- Iguana?

00:25.358 --> 00:26.818
Where did you come from?

00:30.155 --> 00:31.197
- Hey, Em, I forgot my jacket.

00:33.241 --> 00:33.825
- I-I just--

00:33.908 --> 00:35.869
- Emma, is that Iguana?

00:35.952 --> 00:36.619
- Uh, I don't know!

00:36.703 --> 00:38.955
- It is Iguana.

00:39.038 --> 00:41.416
Has the same orange
on the side of its face as...

00:41.499 --> 00:42.208
- I'll take your word for it.

00:45.086 --> 00:45.628
- Why is it here?

00:45.712 --> 00:47.714
- I don't know.

00:47.797 --> 00:48.673
I came in and found it
on the couch.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.842
- Really?
Um, then why do you have

00:50.925 --> 00:52.093
an iguana bed and bowl
with you?

00:53.303 --> 00:55.013
- I have no idea
where those came from.

00:55.096 --> 00:55.972
I'm just as confused as you are.

00:56.055 --> 00:58.266
- Did you have him
this whole time?

00:58.349 --> 00:59.517
- No, I told you.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.186
I came in and found it
sitting on the couch.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.772
Maybe he...waddled in
from the wild?

01:03.855 --> 01:06.191
- Oh, right, yeah,

01:06.274 --> 01:08.568
and carried his food bowl
and bed with him from the wild.

01:08.651 --> 01:11.529
- Uh, I'm not very well-versed
in wild iguana behavior,

01:11.613 --> 01:12.864
but it's possible.

01:12.947 --> 01:14.574
- I got to go,
and I'm taking Iguana

01:14.657 --> 01:16.785
back to its rightful owner--
Tommy.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.077
- Danny, wait!

01:55.698 --> 01:57.867
{\an8}watching them.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.160
- I know.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.871
They're like two lions
circling each other.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.541
Or more like two lizards.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.210
- [gasps] Lizards!
That must be it.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.336
He must have been that lizard
that was in here.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.383
I must have accidentally
turned him into a human.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.265
- Wow!

02:20.348 --> 02:22.183
Who knew lizards could dougie?

02:22.267 --> 02:23.601
- I can teach anyone
how to dougie.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.563
Oh, Maddie, can we keep him?

02:26.646 --> 02:29.065
Please?
- [mouthing words]

02:29.149 --> 02:31.860
- Yikes, he's much better
at dancing than talking.

02:32.902 --> 02:33.945
- I don't know.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.071
It's one thing to have a boy

02:35.155 --> 02:37.365
trapped in a lizard's body,

02:37.448 --> 02:39.909
but a lizard
trapped in a boy's body?

02:39.993 --> 02:42.829
He'll act all bizarre,
and everyone will notice.

02:42.912 --> 02:43.913
[both laugh]

02:43.997 --> 02:46.249
- Not if he's with Sophie.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.459
- Good point.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.842
- We'll get you another iguana.

02:55.925 --> 02:56.634
- I don't want another iguana.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.428
I want Iguana.

02:58.511 --> 03:02.432
- But since you never
actually met Iguana,

03:02.515 --> 03:05.101
won't another iguana
be just as good?

03:05.184 --> 03:06.519
- I could feel his presence
in the house.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.731
Another iguana
won't have the same presence.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.652
- Tommy, guess who I found.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.738
- Iguana?

03:18.489 --> 03:19.949
- You found him.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.159
- Is it really him?

03:21.242 --> 03:22.285
- Yep, I checked.

03:22.368 --> 03:25.204
And FYI, Iguana's a her,
not a him.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.206
- Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

03:33.171 --> 03:35.840
- So you came home...

03:35.924 --> 03:37.926
And it was just
sitting on the couch.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.469
- Yes.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.512
- And where was your father?

03:41.596 --> 03:43.514
- He's at his meeting
with the other big brains,

03:43.598 --> 03:46.309
all enjoying having bigger
brains than everyone else.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.144
- So it couldn't have been him.

03:48.227 --> 03:49.312
- Of course not.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.813
Why would he do that anyway?

03:50.897 --> 03:52.523
- You mean
what could have been his...

03:52.607 --> 03:53.816
motive?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.819
Well, he does hate Daniel
with the fiery passion

03:56.903 --> 04:00.156
of angry villagers going after
a poor, misunderstood vampire.

04:00.239 --> 04:01.658
What--

04:01.741 --> 04:03.493
I know this dog bed.

04:03.576 --> 04:04.494
- You do?

04:04.577 --> 04:05.495
- Yes.
[sniffs]

04:06.746 --> 04:07.747
It was Sophie's.

04:08.915 --> 04:09.791
It belonged to her dog,
Maria Conchita,

04:09.874 --> 04:10.833
when she was a puppy.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.294
- How do you know that?

04:13.378 --> 04:14.587
- I know things.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.757
- And not because it says
"Maria Conchita" on it?

04:17.839 --> 04:20.218
- No...

04:20.301 --> 04:22.428
This could have been
anyone's dog bed.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.639
Maria Conchita's
a very popular dog name.

04:24.722 --> 04:25.181
- Oh, wait.

04:25.264 --> 04:25.890
Now I get it.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.934
I know what happened!

04:28.017 --> 04:28.851
- Me too.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.269
Let's say it at the same time.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.646
- Why?
If we both know--

04:31.729 --> 04:32.855
- Because it'll be fun.
Okay, let's do it.

04:32.939 --> 04:33.856
Three, two, one.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.692
- Maddie and her minions
stole the iguana

04:35.775 --> 04:37.694
and planted it here to frame me!
- Frame you!

04:38.861 --> 04:41.322
Oh, of course!

04:41.406 --> 04:42.031
- That's it.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.658
I'm officially...

04:43.741 --> 04:44.659
mad!

04:44.742 --> 04:46.536
- You are?

04:46.619 --> 04:48.413
- Yes, and they're going to pay!

04:48.496 --> 04:49.288
[zapping]

04:50.790 --> 04:52.417
- Yeah!
Get your angry on!

04:54.752 --> 04:56.587
Oh, we're so gonna
get you, Maddie!

04:56.671 --> 04:57.463
- Yeah, we are!

04:59.757 --> 05:01.092
- And then we're gonna--

05:03.052 --> 05:04.012
Whoa, whoa.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.513
Stop, stop!

05:05.596 --> 05:08.057
If this is what your anger
looks like,

05:08.141 --> 05:08.391
we're in trouble.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.315
- Katie!

05:16.399 --> 05:18.067
- Do I have to go
to tae kwon do today, Mom?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.319
I'm tired...

05:20.403 --> 05:21.029
- Tae kwon do?

05:21.112 --> 05:22.655
You take tae kwon do?

05:22.739 --> 05:23.656
- Huh?

05:23.740 --> 05:24.949
What?

05:25.033 --> 05:28.244
Uh, no, I must have been...

05:28.327 --> 05:29.579
dreaming.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.122
Yeah, that's it.

05:31.205 --> 05:32.623
- It's okay.

05:32.707 --> 05:33.291
You can admit it.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.668
Tae kwon do is cool.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.128
- Really? Then, yeah,
I have a yellow belt.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.172
[speaking foreign language]

05:39.255 --> 05:40.131
- Busted!

05:40.214 --> 05:41.674
Too easy.
[scoffs]

05:41.758 --> 05:44.927
- Uh, so have you found
something yet?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.763
- No!
Nothing.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.097
Just a whole bunch of spells

05:48.181 --> 05:49.390
that either make no sense
or are useless,

05:49.474 --> 05:52.894
not one spell to turn
sneakers into Manolos.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.437
I hate this book!

05:57.398 --> 05:58.566
Help me!

06:06.574 --> 06:07.992
Ow!

06:08.076 --> 06:10.453
Someone get me a mirror,
stat!

06:10.536 --> 06:11.537
- Calm down.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.123
Your nose is still there.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.709
- It's just really big and red,
like Rudolph's.

06:16.793 --> 06:17.960
[laughs]

06:20.004 --> 06:21.380
- Oh, forget it.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.425
I am so through with magic
for the night.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.968
- Good, because Bo is hungry

06:26.052 --> 06:27.136
and needs a place to sleep.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.764
Your pantry will be good
for both those things.

06:29.847 --> 06:30.515
- Bo?

06:30.598 --> 06:31.849
- Short for Bouillabaisse.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.977
It's a great name
and a delicious plate of food.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.813
- I told you not to name him.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.523
Don't get too attached.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.941
- I did more than that.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.067
Watch this.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.778
Bo, fetch!

06:45.905 --> 06:46.948
And that's not all.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.159
It works both ways.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.702
[laughing]

06:51.786 --> 06:55.581
- It's weird, but it's like
they're soul mates.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.297
- Make sure you leave
the iguana in your room

07:03.381 --> 07:04.799
with the door closed, Tommy.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.884
- I should probably
stay at home with him.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.511
He's been through
a traumatic experience.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.595
[doorbell rings]
- Don't even think about it.

07:18.729 --> 07:19.689
- Who was it?

07:19.772 --> 07:20.439
- No one.

07:20.523 --> 07:24.152
[frantic knocking at door]

07:26.237 --> 07:28.030
- Yeah, that doesn't sound
like no one.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.075
- Sounds like someone annoying,
someone like...

07:32.285 --> 07:33.619
- Good morning, Millers.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.037
- Exactly.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.331
- Maddie, what are you
doing here so early?

07:37.415 --> 07:39.917
- I read in Miss Information's
blog that you found Iguana.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.586
- Yeah, we did.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.046
- Good. I need to talk
to you about that.

07:45.840 --> 07:46.632
- Come here.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.427
I'm all ears.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.762
- I know, but I never wanted
to say anything

07:51.846 --> 07:52.388
and hurt your feelings.

07:52.471 --> 07:54.056
They're huge!

07:54.891 --> 07:57.476
- [stammers] I meant, tell me.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.561
- Oh.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.313
[clears throat]
Right.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.734
This is difficult,

08:04.817 --> 08:08.070
but I think Emma
took your iguana.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.449
- You wanted to see me, Coach?

08:11.532 --> 08:12.825
- Yeah.
Take a seat.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.785
I wanted to ask you something.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.580
So you know
you have some powers?

08:17.663 --> 08:19.332
- Oh, yeah, it's so cool,

08:19.415 --> 08:21.167
except when it flies
out of control.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.501
Then it's super cool.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.004
- You really can't let them
fly out of control.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.130
You know what you are?

08:26.214 --> 08:29.091
- Uh, you said something
about a canned eye.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.509
- [chuckles] No.

08:30.593 --> 08:34.639
You're a Churi Kanay,
k-a-n-a-y.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.350
It means son of fire.
- Cool!

08:37.433 --> 08:38.517
- It's a very old tribe that

08:38.601 --> 08:41.312
everyone thought
was extinct, but...

08:42.480 --> 08:44.899
You might be
the last of them,

08:44.982 --> 08:46.567
the last of the Kanays.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.241
- Danny, can we talk?

08:53.324 --> 08:55.076
I'm ready to explain
about yesterday.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.954
- My brother cried all night.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.249
He felt so guilty
that he lost the iguana,

09:01.332 --> 09:03.501
and all this time,
you had him.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.294
- I didn't!
I promise.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.879
- Then how did he get
into your house

09:06.963 --> 09:09.006
complete with a food bowl
and a bed?

09:09.090 --> 09:12.426
- I think...
Maddie put him there.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.761
DANNY: Maddie?

09:13.844 --> 09:15.721
Okay, now you're
really reaching.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.349
I mean, Maddie has done
some pretty shady stuff,

09:18.432 --> 09:20.226
but she had nothing
to do with this.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.769
She wasn't even at the party!

09:21.852 --> 09:24.313
- That doesn't mean
she couldn't have taken Iguana.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.191
- How would she get
into your house? Magic?

09:27.275 --> 09:29.360
- As a matter of fact...

09:29.944 --> 09:31.696
Yes.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.949
Daniel, the truth is...

09:36.033 --> 09:37.702
I am...

09:37.785 --> 09:39.036
The truth is, I'm...

09:39.120 --> 09:41.747
- The next word out of
your mouth better be "sorry,"

09:41.831 --> 09:42.832
because you should be.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.709
BOTH:
I know what you did!

09:44.792 --> 09:46.669
You took the iguana!

09:46.752 --> 09:48.421
- What?
That's outrageous.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.006
I have an airtight alibi.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.217
I was home all night watching
<i>Poodle Shih Tzus In Tiaras,</i>

09:53.301 --> 09:55.177
an exposé into the world
of dog competitions.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.846
You can ask my mom.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.140
- We both know
that doesn't prove anything.

09:59.223 --> 10:02.143
You could have just...

10:02.226 --> 10:04.395
sent it to my house.

10:04.478 --> 10:06.147
- What do you mean by
"sent it"?

10:06.230 --> 10:07.523
- Yeah, seriously.

10:07.606 --> 10:10.151
You're so guilty, you can't even
come up with a good lie.

10:10.234 --> 10:13.738
- Or I just can't make lying
look as good as some people.

10:13.821 --> 10:14.905
- [gasps]
- Not that I'm lying.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.325
I'm just saying
I don't lie very much,

10:17.408 --> 10:18.868
so I'd be bad at it
if I did.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.579
- She's doing this so we won't
get back together, Daniel.

10:21.662 --> 10:22.621
- No,
that's what you're doing!

10:22.705 --> 10:24.832
Not the getting back
together part,

10:24.915 --> 10:26.083
since we never broke up
or, like, officially dated.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.753
- You were never officially
or unofficially dating.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.588
- Can you guys stop fighting?

10:30.671 --> 10:31.756
I just want the truth.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.341
- And I'm giving it to you.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.468
The truth is--

10:35.551 --> 10:36.802
- You wouldn't dare.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.220
- The truth is,

10:38.304 --> 10:40.348
we're both--

10:40.431 --> 10:42.558
- Uh, not responsible.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.268
- Tony?
- What do you want?

10:44.352 --> 10:47.063
Did you lose a dove
or a bunny or something?

10:47.146 --> 10:48.064
- I've never lost
a dove or a bunny!

10:48.147 --> 10:49.899
I did lose a baby chick
one time, but--

10:49.982 --> 10:51.108
- Can you get to the point,
Tony?

10:51.192 --> 10:52.193
- Right.

10:55.029 --> 10:55.821
I know exactly
what happened with Iguana.

10:59.825 --> 11:00.785
- I know

11:00.868 --> 11:02.578
that Emma did not take
the iguana.

11:02.661 --> 11:04.372
She wouldn't do that.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.790
And anyone who really knows her
would know that.

11:08.000 --> 11:08.709
- Thanks, Tony.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.462
- Yeah, yeah, very romantic.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.464
Nerd love is so adorable.

11:13.547 --> 11:14.590
Come on, Daniel.
Let's go.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.300
- That doesn't prove anything.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.344
I mean, I want it to be true,
but I know what I saw.

11:18.427 --> 11:18.719
- And I know what I feel!

11:20.846 --> 11:21.597
Plus, I know that Emma

11:21.680 --> 11:23.682
didn't take the iguana...

11:24.809 --> 11:28.562
Because I was the one
who found him.

11:28.646 --> 11:29.939
ALL: You did?

11:30.022 --> 11:31.732
- I called Daniel to tell him,
but he never answered,

11:31.816 --> 11:33.526
so I took him over to Emma's
to wait.

11:33.609 --> 11:35.111
- You did not.

11:35.194 --> 11:35.653
- How would you know?

11:35.736 --> 11:37.071
- Because...

11:38.197 --> 11:40.241
Because...

11:40.324 --> 11:41.659
How'd you get
into Emma's house?

11:41.742 --> 11:42.952
- Mr. Alonso let me in.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.245
- Where'd you get
the bowl and the bed?

11:44.328 --> 11:45.830
- I stopped by my house first.
- Aha!

11:45.913 --> 11:47.123
Why didn't you leave it
at your house?

11:47.206 --> 11:48.457
- My mom's terrified
of reptiles.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.291
- Why didn't you
take it to Daniel's?

11:49.375 --> 11:50.376
- I knew Emma felt really bad

11:50.459 --> 11:51.919
about leaving
the garage door open,

11:52.002 --> 11:52.795
so I wanted her to be the one
to bring it back.

11:55.923 --> 11:56.924
- [groans]

11:59.176 --> 11:59.927
- Thanks, man.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.303
I don't know what to say.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.639
It all makes sense now.

12:04.849 --> 12:04.890
Kind of.

12:12.648 --> 12:13.649
- Whoa.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.317
What are you doing?

12:15.401 --> 12:16.861
Oh, man!

12:16.944 --> 12:19.613
I just sent "your armpits
smell disarming" to Mac.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.781
- Sorry about the ambush,

12:20.865 --> 12:22.324
but I really need
to talk to you.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.868
- Me?
What did I do?

12:23.951 --> 12:26.328
- Nothing.
And that's the problem.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.164
You and Emma are doing nothing.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.665
You're not getting
the Hexoren back.

12:29.748 --> 12:30.791
She's not magic training.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.001
You're not helping.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.794
- All right, all right,
hold the phone.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.046
I'm not the Guardian.
You are.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.506
I'm just a friend.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.674
- Exactly.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.634
And Emma's in a lot of danger,
Andi.

12:40.718 --> 12:41.844
- Ah, danger.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.679
I mean, we can take Maddie.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.514
I could take Maddie by myself.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.267
- Maddie's not the only one
planning on stealing her powers.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.353
I think there's someone way more
powerful and evil after them.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.855
- More evil than Maddie?

12:52.938 --> 12:55.691
- Not high school evil,
real evil evil.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.109
- What can I do?

12:57.193 --> 12:57.943
I don't have powers.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.154
I'm just some random girl.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.739
- Nothing is ever random,

13:01.822 --> 13:03.741
and you're more prepared
for this than any of us.

13:03.824 --> 13:06.327
You're fearless,
and you're resourceful.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.913
- Oh, that I am.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.539
You think you can butter me up

13:10.623 --> 13:12.374
so I'll be persuaded
to help you?

13:12.458 --> 13:13.542
- No.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.919
I think you'll help me

13:15.002 --> 13:16.712
because Emma's your friend.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.339
- How much trouble is Em in?

13:18.422 --> 13:20.049
- If we don't
get the Hexoren back

13:20.132 --> 13:21.050
and get Emma prepared,

13:21.133 --> 13:22.593
you may not be friends
for much longer.

13:22.676 --> 13:25.346
- Don't worry.
I got this.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.556
Em will be right on track
in no time.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.352
- Thank you

13:31.435 --> 13:32.603
for whatever that was.

13:32.686 --> 13:35.523
- It was the truth, right?

13:37.024 --> 13:38.400
- You didn't have to do that.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.152
- But I wanted to.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.446
I know you would never steal
the iguana

13:42.530 --> 13:42.821
or anything else.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.825
You're too good.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.202
- I'm not as good as you think.

13:50.412 --> 13:51.413
I'll tell you how the iguana
got there, if you want.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.707
- No, I trust you.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.293
You would never hurt anybody.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.296
- Thank you.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.057
- So how does Coach know so much
about being a Kanay?

14:10.140 --> 14:12.101
- I don't know.
I didn't ask.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.603
- Hey, can you toast these
for me?

14:14.687 --> 14:16.105
I feel like some roasted nuts.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.231
- Eh.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.318
Nah, I'm good.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.529
- Just a few in your hand,
and pass them over.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.739
- I'd rather not.
- Why?

14:25.823 --> 14:27.241
- Because someone might see me,

14:27.324 --> 14:29.827
and Julio said not to call
any attention to myself.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.621
- You think you're so cool
just because you can make fire?

14:32.705 --> 14:33.872
Well, guess what.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.958
So can anyone
rubbing two sticks together.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.543
- Why are you being like this?

14:37.626 --> 14:39.587
I just can't share all of
my superpower stuff with you

14:39.670 --> 14:41.714
because, well,
you don't have any.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.132
No, I didn't--
- I see.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.717
Well, you know what I do have?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.385
Trail mix,
and I'm not sharing.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.344
- Mac!

14:47.428 --> 14:48.721
Dude, come on!

14:48.804 --> 14:51.807
- Wow, I'm impressed.

14:51.890 --> 14:54.310
I mean, only thing
I've ever seen Tony stand up to

14:54.393 --> 14:56.437
was a squirrel
sitting on his bike,

14:56.520 --> 14:57.521
and the squirrel won.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.357
- Yeah, I was totally surprised.
- Really?

15:00.441 --> 15:01.650
I mean, he obviously likes you,

15:01.734 --> 15:03.027
you know, even though you...

15:05.738 --> 15:06.905
His...

15:08.282 --> 15:09.617
- Yeah.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.577
Kind of makes you think
you can trust him, huh?

15:11.660 --> 15:12.369
- Whoa, whoa.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.413
No.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.290
It's best if he doesn't know,

15:16.373 --> 15:17.499
and you got to be careful

15:17.583 --> 15:18.542
people don't see you
casting spells.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.669
- That's a switch.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.837
What happened to the Andi

15:21.920 --> 15:23.255
who just wanted
to have fun with magic?

15:23.339 --> 15:26.717
- That Andi realized
how much trouble you're in.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.553
- Wow, you sound
exactly like Lily.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.013
- Yeah, well,
maybe she has a point.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.098
I mean, you could really
lose your powers, Em.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.892
- Would that really be so bad?

15:34.975 --> 15:36.894
Then I could just be
a regular girl

15:36.977 --> 15:38.979
worrying about
boys and clothes,

15:39.063 --> 15:41.690
not disappearing iguanas
and monkey nurses.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.609
- Okay, I don't get it.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.277
Do you even want your powers?

15:45.361 --> 15:46.862
- I didn't say that.

15:46.945 --> 15:49.865
It's just, I'm not sure
I'm gonna get to keep them.

15:49.948 --> 15:51.033
- Okay, maybe not,

15:51.116 --> 15:53.202
but you have to at least
fight for them,

15:53.285 --> 15:55.579
but you're not even trying!

15:55.663 --> 15:57.665
I mean, you have
this amazing gift,

15:57.748 --> 15:58.957
this unreal power,

15:59.041 --> 16:03.379
and these people,
witches counting on you.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.797
- I didn't ask for any of that!

16:04.880 --> 16:08.592
- I know, but sometimes you
have to step up and take charge!

16:08.676 --> 16:10.803
You have to own who you are!

16:11.804 --> 16:13.597
It's like you don't even care.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.187
- Hey, Emma.

16:20.270 --> 16:20.729
Mr. Alonso.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.564
- Hi, guys.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.692
- Can we talk to you
for a minute?

16:24.775 --> 16:26.068
- That depends.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.445
Is cake batter, cereal, or
spaghetti about to fall on me?

16:28.529 --> 16:30.072
- What?

16:30.155 --> 16:31.281
- It's fine, Dad.

16:31.365 --> 16:31.824
See you inside in a bit.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.075
- Oh, okay.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.622
- This is for you.
- It's a thank-you.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.541
- A thank-you?

16:40.624 --> 16:41.333
- For finding Iguana.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.918
- Daniel told us last night

16:43.001 --> 16:44.920
that you were the one
that found him.

16:45.003 --> 16:45.963
- He did?

16:46.046 --> 16:47.131
- So we all made this
as a thank-you.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.014
- The silver balls
go here and there.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.191
- Push this.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.997
- Wow.
Thanks, guys!

17:26.044 --> 17:28.297
- Why'd your mom make you
bring him to school?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.299
- Since I can't open
the Hexoren to find a spell

17:30.382 --> 17:31.717
to change him back,

17:31.800 --> 17:35.220
she's making me take
responsibility for my actions.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.638
So lame.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.099
- Well, maybe the principal
will put him in kindergarten

17:39.183 --> 17:42.352
since he doesn't know
how to do anything.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.979
- That's not true!

17:44.062 --> 17:47.691
I've been teaching him calculus,
quantum physics, and knitting.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.068
Look at this hat he made me.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.323
- He's admitted.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.909
He's your second cousin
from France

17:56.992 --> 17:59.411
who was raised by wolves
and speaks no English.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.370
Have fun.

18:00.454 --> 18:03.123
- I had no idea
you speak French.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.000
That explains everything.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.627
<i>On y va!</i>

18:08.837 --> 18:09.838
- What?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.691
- Huh!
That is bad.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.069
That is real bad.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.862
- I know.
I can't believe I accused her

18:33.946 --> 18:35.697
of stealing my iguana.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.032
- That's bad.

18:37.115 --> 18:37.574
That's real bad.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.993
- I said I know.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.703
Can you focus on helping me
get out of this?

18:41.787 --> 18:42.871
- I don't know.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.456
You dug yourself a deep hole,

18:44.540 --> 18:45.999
and you included Maddie in it?

18:46.083 --> 18:47.960
Huh!
That is bad.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.503
That is real--
- I know!

18:49.586 --> 18:50.671
[sighs]

18:50.754 --> 18:54.341
You know, I'm just gonna
have to apologize.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.884
And--and I'm gonna
have to invite her

18:55.968 --> 18:57.469
to the Beach Ball
volleyball game on Saturday.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.846
- Great idea,

18:58.929 --> 19:00.222
'cause all girls
want to go out with you

19:00.305 --> 19:02.057
after you accuse them
of stealing reptiles.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.934
- Well, I'm gonna
take my chances.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.185
Wish me luck.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.770
And don't eat too much;
we have practice later.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.231
- I know.
Duh.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.071
- Hello, Diego.

19:17.489 --> 19:20.659
Eaten any canned eyes lately?

19:26.498 --> 19:29.960
- I think Emma and Andi
are in a fight.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.378
- You do?
Why?

19:31.461 --> 19:32.754
- I just saw them
in the hallway,

19:32.838 --> 19:33.881
and they weren't
speaking to each other,

19:33.964 --> 19:38.051
and you know how chatty Emma is.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.845
- Really?

19:39.928 --> 19:41.930
This just got interesting.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.515
- What are you going to do?

19:43.599 --> 19:44.766
'cause we have a long list
of people to get back at,

19:44.850 --> 19:47.352
starting with Tony.

19:47.436 --> 19:48.437
- Forget Tony.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.187
We have bigger fish to fry.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.987
- Okay, it's got to be
the queen of hearts.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.447
- Nope.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.865
- Ace of spades?

19:59.948 --> 20:02.117
- You've pulled out,
like, the entire deck.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.953
I mean, it's actually a miracle
you haven't guessed it yet.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.956
- Okay,
this has to be your card.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.918
- "Beach Ball Saturday?"

20:11.001 --> 20:12.294
Not it either.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.379
- Are you sure?

20:14.463 --> 20:15.839
- Yeah, my card
was the nine of diamonds.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.132
- No, look again.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.551
I'm pretty sure
that's your card.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.136
- Tony, I'm telling you,
this isn't--

20:21.219 --> 20:24.014
- No, it's your card
that I made for you, okay?

20:24.097 --> 20:25.140
I'm asking you
if you want to go

20:25.223 --> 20:26.892
to the Beach Ball
on Saturday together.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.450
- Would you look who it is?

20:43.533 --> 20:44.451
- It's Andi.

20:44.534 --> 20:45.827
- What happened to you?

20:45.911 --> 20:47.621
Lose one of your drill bits?

20:47.704 --> 20:48.830
- Very funny.

20:48.914 --> 20:49.998
Leave me alone.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.375
- You are alone,

20:51.458 --> 20:52.542
which is strange.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.418
- Yeah.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.088
Where's your little friend?

20:56.171 --> 20:56.964
Oh, wait.
That's right.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.424
I saw you two this morning,

20:59.508 --> 21:01.176
and you weren't talking.

21:01.259 --> 21:03.345
You guys get in a fight
or something?

21:03.428 --> 21:06.390
- Oh, she got in a fight,
and now she has no friends.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.015
Boo-hoo.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.351
- Leave me alone,

21:09.434 --> 21:12.729
or I'll lose one of
my drill bits in your ear!

21:12.813 --> 21:14.356
- I know what you need.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.694
You need new friends,

21:18.777 --> 21:21.238
friends like us.

21:21.321 --> 21:23.532
- I'd rather be fed to zombies.

21:23.615 --> 21:24.908
- But you loves zombies,

21:24.992 --> 21:28.578
so you would love us.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.913
- Do it.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.833
Do it.
Do it.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.712
- Just like Sophie,
Katie, and me,

21:36.795 --> 21:38.839
a Panther you shall be.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.809
- Why...

21:50.892 --> 21:53.145
am I wearing this outfit...

21:53.228 --> 21:55.147
[gasps]
And these shoes?

21:55.230 --> 21:57.482
Get me out of these, stat!
