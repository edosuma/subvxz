00:10.208 --> 00:12.833
[ominous music]

00:17.166 --> 00:19.583
[footsteps approaching]

00:32.458 --> 00:36.000
[Mirana] These young acolytes,
they worship for one moon phase

00:36.083 --> 00:39.250
and think because they're new and shiny
they should be Selemene's favorites.

00:39.333 --> 00:42.791
They should know their place.
I know my own.

00:43.916 --> 00:46.125
What? I don't feel threatened.

00:49.708 --> 00:51.125
[swooshes]

00:55.041 --> 00:57.500
Crescent light upon you, sister.

00:59.416 --> 01:01.791
It's very shiny?

01:01.875 --> 01:04.916
[tense music]

01:09.166 --> 01:10.916
Sagan! Komi!

01:12.875 --> 01:14.208
[groans]

01:16.208 --> 01:17.666
[panting]

01:29.708 --> 01:31.583
[whooshing]

01:34.583 --> 01:35.708
[grunts]

01:42.041 --> 01:43.083
Ah!

01:43.958 --> 01:45.250
[groans]

01:45.333 --> 01:46.750
[panting]

01:46.833 --> 01:48.250
[growls]

01:50.333 --> 01:52.666
[heavy breathing]

01:57.875 --> 01:59.375
[Fyrmyn] I don't return empty-handed.

02:00.291 --> 02:02.416
-See?
-[Dyfed] The Lotuses of Mene.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.458
Is this where you've been?

02:05.041 --> 02:06.625
-Doing this?
-What?

02:06.708 --> 02:07.708
How did you…

02:07.791 --> 02:10.666
I found them. In a pool of water.

02:11.708 --> 02:13.208
In the Nightsilver Woods.

02:13.291 --> 02:15.041
The Nightsilver Woods?

02:15.125 --> 02:17.500
-How did you get in?
-How did you get out?

02:17.583 --> 02:18.666
[sniffs]

02:18.750 --> 02:20.375
The flowers smell weird.

02:20.458 --> 02:21.916
[Dyfed] And you did this by yourself.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.500
I had to.

02:24.041 --> 02:25.250
Someone had to.

02:25.333 --> 02:26.750
Because of a story?

02:26.833 --> 02:28.416
The Nightsilver Woods are real.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.958
The lotuses are real.

02:30.041 --> 02:33.583
I saw home, our real home.

02:34.208 --> 02:37.000
And… and with these, I'll lead us back.

02:37.083 --> 02:40.500
We'll take it back. It's ours.
Just like the story says.

02:41.541 --> 02:44.541
You are mad. But I love you.

02:44.625 --> 02:45.500
And I've missed you.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.958
Hmm. We've all missed you.

02:48.041 --> 02:49.416
Not now.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.250
Now I have to find him.

02:57.958 --> 03:00.958
[ominous music]

03:51.041 --> 03:52.916
[breathing heavily]

03:54.875 --> 03:56.625
[rattling]

03:56.708 --> 03:59.916
[screams, exhales deeply]

04:00.000 --> 04:04.791
[Mirana] Give me a reason,
any reason, not to kill you.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.583
Every night for the last week
I've watched this happen,

04:07.666 --> 04:10.375
and every night
I ask myself that question.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.833
-But you don't.
-No, I don't.

04:13.916 --> 04:16.416
I keep having these nightmares.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.791
Nightmares?

04:17.875 --> 04:21.625
The dragons. I hear them, their voices.

04:21.708 --> 04:23.166
They're everywhere.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.333
The ones you've slain.

04:25.416 --> 04:29.000
No. All of them. All dragons.

04:29.083 --> 04:32.750
It's just words and words and music.

04:32.833 --> 04:36.791
Like their singing to each other.
Uh, to me.

04:36.875 --> 04:40.166
About whatever it was
you said you saw in that cave.

04:40.250 --> 04:41.375
Maybe.

04:42.541 --> 04:44.333
It's strange, I don't understand.

04:44.416 --> 04:49.041
But they're inside me, and I don't…
I don't know how to stop them.

04:49.625 --> 04:51.041
Other than waking up.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.666
Other than that.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.500
At least until I reach Dragon Hold.

04:56.250 --> 04:58.291
We'll reach the Sage by week's end.

05:00.083 --> 05:01.166
Maybe he can help.

05:05.333 --> 05:09.750
[Fymryn] A thousand years ago,
deep in the Nightsilver Woods,

05:09.833 --> 05:13.416
the sun shut her eyes
and the moon turned to blood.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.458
-Did it hurt?
-It made her weak.

05:15.541 --> 05:17.458
Mene, the Goddess of the Moon.

05:17.541 --> 05:20.000
Yes. Ssh. Listen now.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.500
The night turned red,

05:21.583 --> 05:24.791
and our goddess was trapped
in shadow by Selemene.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.375
Selemene, the Dark Moon Goddess.

05:28.041 --> 05:30.291
Mene is still inside the shadow?

05:30.375 --> 05:32.958
-[Fymryn] She is.
-[girl 1] Can she get out?

05:33.041 --> 05:35.500
[girl 2] Why? Why did Selemene do that?

05:35.583 --> 05:38.416
Selemene wanted worship
from the Coriel'Tauvi.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.875
Punished anyone
who wouldn't call her Goddess.

05:40.958 --> 05:44.041
But some elves,
they did say their prayers to her?

05:44.125 --> 05:47.625
-To Selemene?
-Yes, some did. Some still do.

05:47.708 --> 05:50.625
-But she's evil.
-That's how evil works sometimes.

05:50.708 --> 05:51.833
But…

05:51.916 --> 05:54.791
Selemene banished anyone
who wouldn't pray to her,

05:54.875 --> 05:56.791
far from our home
in the Nightsilver Woods,

05:56.875 --> 05:58.916
into the darkest corners of the world.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.541
Our true Goddess left this world,

06:01.625 --> 06:06.250
but every day, we worship Mene,
so one day she'll come back to us.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.250
[all] Praise the moon of Mene.

06:09.333 --> 06:12.208
But if Mene is dead,
how does she come back?

06:12.291 --> 06:16.375
Through belief. Worship.
What is divine may never die.

06:17.166 --> 06:21.000
You see, Mene left a gift for us
in the Temple.

06:21.083 --> 06:24.083
-Her magical lotuses.
-Presents?

06:24.166 --> 06:25.750
But they're just flowers.

06:25.833 --> 06:29.375
Special flowers.
She lived for her flowers,

06:29.458 --> 06:33.500
so when he lays the flowers
on the earth, she will return.

06:33.583 --> 06:35.416
Uh… who is he?

06:35.500 --> 06:38.875
He is a man with spectacular
knowledge and power.

06:38.958 --> 06:40.291
A sorcerer.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.083
-Does he have a name?
-[Fymryn] He doesn't.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.958
He lives in a miraculous tower,

06:45.041 --> 06:48.000
tucked in the valley
of the highest mountains.

06:48.083 --> 06:51.500
And that's where I will go.
And I will bring him these.

06:52.541 --> 06:54.208
The presents.

06:54.291 --> 06:55.125
[gasps]

06:55.208 --> 06:58.583
You're going to bring back Mene.
You're going to take us home.

06:58.666 --> 07:02.416
I don't wanna go home. I want more story.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.708
[chuckles]
Don't worry. There's plenty left to tell.

07:08.416 --> 07:11.166
So you're really leaving to find this man?

07:11.250 --> 07:12.583
You're not coming?

07:12.666 --> 07:14.666
We've all heard the stories, but you…

07:15.791 --> 07:18.208
-It's like you live them.
-We all live them.

07:18.291 --> 07:19.875
[Dyfed] Not good enough.

07:19.958 --> 07:23.000
You left without a word last time
and returned with those lotuses.

07:23.583 --> 07:27.791
Now you're leaving again, and expect us
to follow with no questions asked.

07:28.416 --> 07:30.000
We need you to let us in.

07:30.958 --> 07:32.666
We need to know.

07:32.750 --> 07:35.708
The stories, what makes you so sure?

07:36.250 --> 07:37.250
This.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.291
This is why.

07:40.041 --> 07:41.541
I can do this.

07:41.625 --> 07:42.583
And this.

07:42.666 --> 07:44.958
Ooh! Now do me.

07:46.750 --> 07:49.416
[Fymryn] I can even make it seem like
I was never here at all.

07:50.416 --> 07:53.666
-You should've told us.
-Told you what? That I'm a freak?

07:53.750 --> 07:55.583
Would you have looked at me the same?

07:55.666 --> 07:59.333
The stories say Mene's priests
and warriors could do those things.

07:59.416 --> 08:01.666
But Mene is gone. She's dead.

08:02.291 --> 08:04.875
Or maybe some part of Mene
is still out there.

08:04.958 --> 08:07.208
-And she has chosen me.
-[Dyfed] No.

08:08.958 --> 08:11.125
Mene has chosen us.

08:13.041 --> 08:16.041
[dramatic music]

08:19.958 --> 08:20.833
[Davion] Left.

08:21.416 --> 08:25.833
That path will run another week.
This one will cut days off our journey.

08:25.916 --> 08:29.375
Yeah, it's faster. If it doesn't kill you.

08:29.458 --> 08:32.333
I've traveled these roads.
I don't go right.

08:32.416 --> 08:36.208
-And with this storm coming in…
-[Mirana] I'll take my chances on faster.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.750
[wind swooshing]

08:39.833 --> 08:41.250
[Davion] Ice up ahead.

08:42.458 --> 08:45.250
-How much longer till the bottom?
-Too long.

08:45.333 --> 08:47.916
-We'll wait till the worst passes.
-Wait?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.666
[panting]

08:49.750 --> 08:52.250
I won't spend a night with you up here.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.375
Maybe you should've thought of that
back in Haupstadt.

08:54.458 --> 08:57.166
I could have left you to the guards.

08:57.250 --> 08:58.083
Fair point.

08:58.708 --> 08:59.750
It's too slick.

09:03.333 --> 09:06.291
Lash ourselves together. To Sagan.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.541
His weight will hold us.

09:08.625 --> 09:11.041
[ominous music]

09:13.125 --> 09:15.541
[breathing heavily]

09:16.625 --> 09:19.458
[rumbling]

09:24.583 --> 09:25.791
[gasping]

09:27.291 --> 09:28.708
[ice cracking]

09:28.791 --> 09:29.958
[grunts]

09:30.041 --> 09:31.750
[Davion] Mirana!

09:32.375 --> 09:33.416
[grunts]

09:37.375 --> 09:38.500
[groans]

09:39.708 --> 09:40.750
[Davion] Hold on to me!

09:44.166 --> 09:46.041
[grunting]

09:46.875 --> 09:48.583
[whimpers]

09:51.375 --> 09:53.125
[grunting]

09:57.833 --> 10:00.500
It's me. I'm too heavy.

10:01.416 --> 10:02.583
We can make it.

10:06.333 --> 10:09.458
[Davion] Mirana, what are you doing? No!

10:12.541 --> 10:14.000
Mirana!

10:14.083 --> 10:17.083
[somber music]

10:22.000 --> 10:24.333
[heavy breathing]

10:25.625 --> 10:26.916
Marci!

10:27.750 --> 10:29.333
Davion!

10:31.666 --> 10:33.416
[pants]
Anyone?

10:40.750 --> 10:42.666
I see it. I told you.

10:42.750 --> 10:43.958
See what?

10:44.458 --> 10:47.291
The tower.
Right there between the two peaks.

10:47.375 --> 10:48.791
I don't see anything.

10:48.875 --> 10:51.291
It's down there. Trust me.

10:53.041 --> 10:56.041
[ominous music]

10:58.083 --> 11:01.000
[dramatic music]

11:12.208 --> 11:13.208
Sorcerer.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.416
Just like the stories.

11:22.791 --> 11:24.291
[Fymryn] Hello?

11:30.166 --> 11:32.250
-This place is…
-[Idwal] Big.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.541
I was going to say empty.

11:34.625 --> 11:38.166
-Big and empty.
-This way. I think.

11:39.583 --> 11:42.291
[Dyfed] Big, empty, and strange.

11:46.833 --> 11:49.833
[foreboding music]

12:08.166 --> 12:09.541
[gasps]

12:13.708 --> 12:14.916
[Dyfed] What is that?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
[foreboding music continues]

12:33.500 --> 12:35.625
[Fymryn] Dyfed? Adara?

12:36.250 --> 12:39.166
-Idwal?
-[Invoker] Name yourself.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.958
Fymryn, of Enclave Coedwig.

12:44.041 --> 12:46.250
[Invoker] How did you find my tower?

12:46.333 --> 12:48.083
It stands high in the valley.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.875
[Invoker] But how? How did you see it?

12:50.958 --> 12:52.833
It was hard to miss.

12:52.916 --> 12:55.458
[Invoker] And in a thousand years,
no one has found it.

12:55.541 --> 12:58.416
And then you simply saw it.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.916
Yes. Like I told you.

13:01.458 --> 13:02.916
[tinkles]

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
[dreamy music]

13:11.333 --> 13:12.916
You. Are you…

13:13.958 --> 13:14.833
Are you him?

13:17.750 --> 13:19.833
I brought these. The lotuses.

13:19.916 --> 13:23.125
Taken from the Temple,
from the Nightsilver Woods.

13:23.208 --> 13:25.875
I did the thing they said
could never be done.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.541
[dreamy music continues]

13:35.041 --> 13:37.416
You're a thief. Nothing more.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.958
But, but, but I…

13:39.041 --> 13:41.416
I did everything the story said,
and… and now…

13:41.500 --> 13:44.291
Now, you may leave.

13:44.375 --> 13:46.833
Our true goddess lives in these lotuses.

13:46.916 --> 13:49.625
Mene lives in them. Please take them.
Bring her back.

13:49.708 --> 13:51.625
Stories are stories.

13:51.708 --> 13:55.583
Dead is dead. No one can change that.

13:55.666 --> 13:57.708
Not even I can change that.

13:57.791 --> 13:59.041
I breached the temple.

13:59.125 --> 14:02.541
I… I risked everything to get here.
This can't be how it ends.

14:02.625 --> 14:04.666
For your trouble.

14:04.750 --> 14:07.083
[suspenseful music]

14:08.041 --> 14:09.625
[grunts]

14:09.708 --> 14:10.750
Cochi.

14:11.875 --> 14:12.916
[Adara] You're safe.

14:14.208 --> 14:17.583
One second we were all there,
and then the next we were all here.

14:17.666 --> 14:21.250
All but you. I am so relieved.

14:21.333 --> 14:25.458
Ugh, I'm so sick. Let's not do that again.

14:25.541 --> 14:27.583
We should've listened to you.

14:27.666 --> 14:31.291
-What we saw… What we found…
-Nothing.

14:31.375 --> 14:34.583
-We found nothing.
-We saw wonders.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.250
I failed.

14:36.958 --> 14:38.208
There's no wonder in that.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.125
Mene.

14:44.750 --> 14:48.458
[eerie music]

14:51.958 --> 14:54.416
[breathing heavily]

14:57.666 --> 14:59.250
[panting]

15:01.833 --> 15:03.125
[Mirana] Davion?

15:03.791 --> 15:04.750

-[groaning]

15:59.458 --> 16:03.083
Goddess, forgive me.
I've failed you. I know now.

16:03.166 --> 16:04.000
[panting]

16:04.083 --> 16:06.291
But never again, I swear to you.

16:07.833 --> 16:12.791
Please. I am nothing without you. No one.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.500
Please. I just…

16:16.750 --> 16:18.166
I want to come home.

16:20.541 --> 16:22.125
Can't I come home?

16:23.041 --> 16:24.416
I love you.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.500
[dramatic music]

16:34.041 --> 16:35.000
[Dyfed] It's you.

16:35.708 --> 16:38.291
-Don't you see it in the eyes?
-I do.

16:38.375 --> 16:40.208
But her nose looks just like yours.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.583
Smile for me.

16:41.666 --> 16:44.708
Aha! A bit of rabbit in your teeth.

16:44.791 --> 16:47.666
-Right there.
-There's something to this.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.333
Something about you and this coin.

16:49.416 --> 16:55.458
Both are beautiful. Worship with us.
We'll give the Goddess our love.

16:56.791 --> 16:58.625
[all] Love her together.

17:54.500 --> 17:58.625
[Star] Mirana. You have forgotten me.

[ominous music]

18:14.458 --> 18:16.583
[swooshing]

18:20.291 --> 18:21.541
[whooshing]

18:24.125 --> 18:25.291
Mirana.

18:28.250 --> 18:29.583
Remember.

18:29.666 --> 18:32.833

20:24.000 --> 20:24.875
[gasps]

20:24.958 --> 20:26.166
[Luna] We know what you want.

20:27.166 --> 20:30.166
The return of your Dark Lady, Mene.

20:31.333 --> 20:35.000
Mene, who would plunge the world
in endless shadow.

20:35.083 --> 20:36.583
-[gasps]
-[Luna] Not today.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.125
Give me the lotuses,

20:39.208 --> 20:41.750
or I send all of you
back to her dead embrace.

20:41.833 --> 20:44.958
We… We don't have them. They're gone.

20:46.916 --> 20:49.458
-[grunts]
-[shrieks]

20:53.208 --> 20:57.291
What… What have you done?
What have you done?

20:57.375 --> 21:02.458
-The lotuses. Now.
-Stop. Please. I don't have them.

21:03.291 --> 21:05.791
Lying. Unwise.

21:05.875 --> 21:07.333

[yells]

21:26.458 --> 21:27.750
[gasps]

21:27.833 --> 21:31.166
You killed them. Killed them for nothing.

21:31.250 --> 21:35.958
-The lotuses are gone.
-The lotuses or your head. You choose.

21:38.291 --> 21:41.291
[eerie music]

21:44.875 --> 21:48.041
-I told you I don't have them!
-It's to be the head then.

21:53.333 --> 21:56.333
[eerie music]

21:57.083 --> 21:59.083
[panting]

22:05.541 --> 22:07.958
The old story is over.

22:08.541 --> 22:11.541
We will write a new one together.

22:25.375 --> 22:26.958
[Davion] Don't ask, just drink it.

22:32.250 --> 22:35.250
-[Mirana] You saved me.
-I returned a favor.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.083
Two favors. Finish it.

22:38.833 --> 22:41.333
There's a Dragon Knight Redoubt
a few miles from here.

22:41.416 --> 22:43.208
We'll push through in the morning.

22:43.833 --> 22:45.958
Think you can handle
another night with me?

22:47.166 --> 22:49.916
-Is that a no, or a yes?
-I…

22:50.416 --> 22:54.916
I saw things. In the cave. In the snow.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.041
-Yeah. Big, ugly, bad breath.
-No. Worse. People.

23:01.791 --> 23:05.166
People transformed
into monstrous things by…

23:05.250 --> 23:09.291
I don't know. Those were people
that we killed back there.

23:09.375 --> 23:11.250
Or used to be.

23:11.333 --> 23:14.166
And you think…
You think that's what I am.

23:14.250 --> 23:16.791
-What I'll become.
-No, it's the opposite.

23:17.666 --> 23:20.125
You become something I cannot name.

23:20.208 --> 23:24.458
A demon, a dragon, who can say?
But underneath it's still you.

23:24.541 --> 23:26.375
I still see you.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.625
Watch over me while I sleep.

23:31.833 --> 23:33.416
There are monsters about.

23:34.125 --> 23:35.916
