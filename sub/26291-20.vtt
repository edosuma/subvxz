a little early.

03:02.881 --> 03:04.814
Well, there's a method
to that madness, too.

03:04.883 --> 03:07.050
Laurel has a solo recital
this weekend,

03:07.119 --> 03:08.818
and I'm heading
to New York tonight.

03:08.887 --> 03:11.488
She must be thrilled.

03:11.556 --> 03:12.856
She's more on the, uh,

03:12.924 --> 03:15.859
skeptical range
of the spectrum.

03:15.927 --> 03:19.429
I've missed my share
of events in her life.

03:19.498 --> 03:23.933
It hasn't gone unnoticed
by her or her mother.

03:24.002 --> 03:26.169
Linda will be there?

03:26.238 --> 03:28.371
Linda's always there.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.884
- Well, she's a good mom, Dwayne.
- Yeah.

03:29.908 --> 03:31.041
And you're a good father.

03:31.109 --> 03:33.209
I am.

03:33.278 --> 03:35.078
But I've spent
a lot of years

03:35.147 --> 03:37.013
focused on the work.

03:37.082 --> 03:38.882
Putting everything else second.
And then...

03:38.950 --> 03:41.718
You faced death,
and it changed you.

03:41.787 --> 03:45.322
Well, I'm trying to live up
to those changes.

03:46.792 --> 03:50.293
Organize more work/life balance.

03:50.362 --> 03:53.029
You have unique
organizational skills,

03:53.098 --> 03:55.799
but you always find a way.

03:55.867 --> 03:57.367
Yeah.

03:57.436 --> 03:59.869
Ah, speaking of work,

03:59.938 --> 04:01.705
I've got a victim.

04:01.773 --> 04:03.139
Oh. Navy?

04:03.208 --> 04:04.441
I'm afraid so.

04:06.144 --> 04:07.877
Eye on the prize, Dwayne.

04:07.946 --> 04:09.879
You've got a recital
to attend.

04:11.758 --> 04:13.124
<i>Tyrone Gibson,</i>

04:13.192 --> 04:14.592
30-year-old
Navy recruiter.

04:14.661 --> 04:16.694
Body was found in the alley
of the Versailles Club

04:16.762 --> 04:18.829
last night when the porter
was taking out the trash.

04:18.898 --> 04:20.576
- Looking at a robbery?
- Considering he had

04:20.600 --> 04:22.233
12K in his pocket,
I'd say no.

04:22.302 --> 04:24.385
That's a lot of cash
for an enlisted man.

04:24.386 --> 04:25.418
Yeah.

04:25.487 --> 04:27.019
Yeah, nice suit, too.

04:27.088 --> 04:28.688
It's custom-made,
hand-tailored.

04:28.757 --> 04:29.867
What was the cause of death?

04:29.891 --> 04:31.424
Gunshot wound
to the chest,

04:31.493 --> 04:33.259
and based on stippling
and muzzle imprint,

04:33.328 --> 04:34.861
I'd say at very close range.

04:34.963 --> 04:36.929
I see some defensive wounds
here, too.

04:36.998 --> 04:38.965
Well, he fought his attackers
and lost.

04:39.033 --> 04:40.833
Well, hopefully the suspect
left some DNA.

04:40.902 --> 04:42.368
Let you know when I do.

04:42.437 --> 04:43.369
Any witnesses?

04:43.438 --> 04:44.971
Whole club full.

04:45.039 --> 04:46.584
Lasalle and Sebastian just
took their statements.

04:46.608 --> 04:48.541
- I'll check in with NOPD.
- Okay.

04:48.610 --> 04:50.710
Tyrone Gibson took 20
of his best friends

04:50.779 --> 04:52.612
for the night out
on the town.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.814
Yeah, picked them up in
a limo, then they went

04:54.883 --> 04:56.160
to Commander's Palace
for dinner,

04:56.184 --> 04:58.184
then came here
for the full VIP experience.

04:58.253 --> 04:59.852
Oh? What was the occasion?

04:59.921 --> 05:01.521
Tyrone won the lottery
last week.

05:01.589 --> 05:03.122
$100,000 jackpot.

05:03.191 --> 05:04.557
Wanted to share the wealth.

05:04.626 --> 05:06.570
Which, according to his
friends, was not uncommon.

05:06.594 --> 05:09.061
All right, he was generous to
friends and strangers alike.

05:09.130 --> 05:10.563
What was he doing
before he died?

05:10.632 --> 05:12.732
Well, he got a bunch of texts
from an unknown number

05:12.801 --> 05:14.044
demanding to see him
immediately.

05:14.068 --> 05:15.568
He told them to come
to the club.

05:15.637 --> 05:17.348
Yeah, and his crew said
that Tyrone met a woman

05:17.372 --> 05:18.716
at the front entrance,
left with her,

05:18.740 --> 05:20.072
and that was the last time

05:20.141 --> 05:22.408
anyone saw him here
around midnight.

05:22.477 --> 05:23.976
We get a description
on this woman?

05:24.045 --> 05:26.379
I mean, these guys were drunk,
the club was crowded.

05:26.448 --> 05:29.215
The most consistent detail
we got was, what, dark hair.

05:29.284 --> 05:32.018
And she wasn't dressed for the
night out-- jeans and a hoodie.

05:32.086 --> 05:33.697
We need to track this
woman down. Grab that footage.

05:33.721 --> 05:35.983
Find out who she is and how
she's connected to Tyrone.

05:35.984 --> 05:38.251
You got it.

05:43.029 --> 05:44.384
<i>Spoke to Tyrone Gibson's</i>

05:44.385 --> 05:45.590
C.O. and colleagues.

05:45.591 --> 05:47.458
On all accounts,
he was a saint.

05:47.527 --> 05:49.193
Top recruiter
six months running.

05:49.262 --> 05:51.707
Spent his weekends volunteering
at a criminal diversion program

05:51.731 --> 05:53.375
helping young offenders
turn their lives around.

05:53.399 --> 05:55.766
All I do on the weekends
is play video games.

05:55.802 --> 05:59.069
Hey, not only that. Aside from
the suit and the night out,

05:59.138 --> 06:00.704
his buddies say
Tyrone was going

06:00.740 --> 06:02.807
to donate the rest
of his winnings to charity.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.042
Now he ends up dead.
That's the lottery for you.

06:05.111 --> 06:06.477
Come into some unexpected cash,

06:06.546 --> 06:07.912
and your whole life
goes to crap.

06:07.980 --> 06:09.914
I don't know about that.

06:09.982 --> 06:11.849
No, it's a statistical fact.

06:11.918 --> 06:13.695
70% of winners lose
everything within ten years.

06:13.719 --> 06:15.352
The whole system
should be abolished.

06:15.421 --> 06:16.701
You do have to be
smart about it,

06:16.756 --> 06:18.355
strategize a plan of action.

06:18.424 --> 06:20.102
Yeah, well, you may feel
differently after you see this.

06:20.126 --> 06:22.860
Check this out.

06:22.929 --> 06:25.930
That is Tyrone and our
person of interest.

06:25.998 --> 06:28.132
And she is not happy with him.

06:29.168 --> 06:31.168
Okay, where are
they going?

06:31.237 --> 06:32.915
Well, that's our only angle
outside the club.

06:32.939 --> 06:34.338
But then, a few moments later...

06:39.645 --> 06:42.079
That is as close to a
smoking gun as you're gonna get.

06:42.148 --> 06:44.448
Yeah, but we don't
have an I.D. on her,

06:44.517 --> 06:45.883
and no clue
where she went.

06:45.952 --> 06:47.192
No, not yet,
but check this out.

06:47.253 --> 06:48.586
So, she flees to the street.

06:48.654 --> 06:52.389
I was able to pull up
some traffic cam footage.

06:52.458 --> 06:54.225
There's our suspect.

06:54.293 --> 06:55.926
Yeah, and there...

06:55.995 --> 06:59.930
is our gun and our helping hand.
Pun intended.

06:59.999 --> 07:02.277
- You think you can pull a print?
- Yeah, I'm feeling lucky.

07:02.301 --> 07:05.135
- I'll get Gregorio, go check it out.
- Awesome.

07:05.204 --> 07:07.104
This is Wendy Cotts,
23 years old.

07:07.173 --> 07:09.406
Already sporting
quite a résumé.

07:09.475 --> 07:11.709
Yeah, she dropped out of MIT
a few years ago

07:11.777 --> 07:13.911
with a perfect GPA
to go follow her bliss,

07:13.980 --> 07:16.280
which, in this case, seems
to be a life of cybercrime.

07:16.349 --> 07:17.915
At 19, she was convicted

07:17.984 --> 07:20.262
here in New Orleans of identity
theft and credit card fraud.

07:20.286 --> 07:22.253
Yeah, sentence suspended,
but by 20,

07:22.321 --> 07:24.755
she went federal
with an elaborate phishing scam.

07:24.824 --> 07:26.223
She serve any time?

07:26.292 --> 07:28.826
Hey. What's the
big boss doing here?

07:28.895 --> 07:30.961
Uh, I don't mean to interrupt.
Thanks, Roy.

07:31.030 --> 07:33.350
Just, uh, wrapped up my case
review, returning these files,

07:33.399 --> 07:35.833
and I'm off to the airport.
Act like I'm not here.

07:35.902 --> 07:38.602
Okay, so, Wendy avoided prison

07:38.671 --> 07:41.405
by enrolling
in a criminal diversion program

07:41.474 --> 07:42.423
taught by none other than...

07:42.447 --> 07:44.242
Let me guess.
Tyrone Gibson.

07:44.243 --> 07:44.794
Bingo.

07:44.818 --> 07:46.478
So you're thinking she found out
that he won the lottery

07:46.479 --> 07:48.023
and tried to hold him up
for the winnings?

07:48.047 --> 07:49.391
Well, it doesn't sound
like her M.O., does it?

07:49.415 --> 07:51.649
I mean, she's a hacker and
online confidence woman,

07:51.717 --> 07:53.417
not a violent felon.

07:53.486 --> 07:55.286
- You want to join us?
- No. No, I'm good.

07:55.354 --> 07:56.687
Continue.

07:56.756 --> 07:59.490
Well, I agree with Pride.
It just doesn't add up.

07:59.559 --> 08:01.637
We got her running from the
scene of the crime with a gun.

08:01.661 --> 08:04.295
Does ballistics connect it
to the murder?

08:04.363 --> 08:07.264
Well, Wade's still finishing her
autopsy, so too soon to tell.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.767
We also have angry texts between
Tyrone and a burner phone

08:09.835 --> 08:11.502
we assume is Wendy.

08:11.571 --> 08:14.305
She was demanding
to meet with him last night.

08:14.373 --> 08:15.984
Sounds like she followed through
on her demands,

08:16.008 --> 08:17.653
'cause a few minutes later,
Tyrone was dead.

08:17.677 --> 08:20.044
Sounds to me like
what you need to do right now

08:20.112 --> 08:22.546
is to find this woman.

08:22.615 --> 08:25.115
I'm just saying.

08:26.385 --> 08:27.818
All right, well,

08:27.887 --> 08:29.620
according to her records,
she's had about

08:29.689 --> 08:31.333
five different addresses
in the last few months,

08:31.357 --> 08:32.990
all of them
in the New Orleans area.

08:33.058 --> 08:34.491
Now, the thing that I...

08:34.559 --> 08:36.894
What's happening?

08:38.464 --> 08:39.830
The addresses being deleted?

08:39.899 --> 08:41.498
Yeah, it's not just
the addresses.

08:41.567 --> 08:44.835
It's her DMV files,
her arrest records, everything.

08:44.904 --> 08:46.203
Somebody's attacking our system

08:46.272 --> 08:48.038
and erasing every trace
of Wendy Cotts.

08:48.107 --> 08:49.473
What? How?

08:49.542 --> 08:51.642
I'm running a root
diagnostic right now.

08:51.711 --> 08:53.622
Everyone, um, turn off your
computers right now, okay?

08:53.646 --> 08:55.212
Otherwise, we're
gonna lose everything.

08:55.281 --> 08:57.559
- Can you stop this, Sebastian?
- I'm not sure that I can.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.717
Might be able to track
who's doing it to us,

08:59.785 --> 09:01.665
get answers from them.
- Hack like this could be

09:01.721 --> 09:03.554
coming from anywhere
around the world, right?

09:03.623 --> 09:05.663
Ah, this one's close to home.
The attacker used a...

09:05.725 --> 09:08.258
a back door to get in,
almost like they had a key.

09:08.327 --> 09:10.138
What makes you think
they're coming from nearby?

09:10.162 --> 09:11.773
Because they're using
our Wi-Fi network to do it.

09:11.797 --> 09:14.064
It means they're within a
block of the squad room.

09:19.772 --> 09:21.438
Okay. Divide and conquer.

09:21.507 --> 09:23.574
- Way ahead of you.
- No. Hold up.

09:23.643 --> 09:25.643
Van.

09:30.316 --> 09:31.849
Go.

09:35.821 --> 09:36.987
Hold.

09:44.363 --> 09:46.363
Federal agents!
Open the door slow!

09:46.432 --> 09:47.698
Out of the vehicle now!

09:47.767 --> 09:48.887
Hands where we can see them!

09:54.106 --> 09:55.506
Elvis.

09:56.475 --> 09:57.475
Sorry, Dwayne.

09:57.543 --> 09:58.942
This is not what it looks like.

09:59.011 --> 10:00.944
Yeah, well, it looks
like you hacked

10:01.013 --> 10:03.947
into the NCIS network
and sabotaged us.

10:04.016 --> 10:06.750
Okay, it is what it looks like,
but I can explain.

10:06.819 --> 10:08.030
- You guys know this guy?
- Unfortunately.

10:08.054 --> 10:09.920
- Yes.
- Elvis Bertrand,

10:09.989 --> 10:11.388
at your service.
- I'm good.

10:11.457 --> 10:13.090
We have, uh, history.

10:13.159 --> 10:14.625
Yeah, I've saved
his ass many times.

10:14.694 --> 10:16.126
You've saved <i>my</i> ass?

10:16.195 --> 10:18.162
- I'm like the fifth Beatle.
- Yeah.

10:18.230 --> 10:19.797
Why is the fifth Beatle
sabotaging

10:19.865 --> 10:21.765
a secure government network?
Sorry about that.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.278
You guys were looking
for Wendy Cotts,

10:23.302 --> 10:24.668
and I cannot
let you find her.

10:24.737 --> 10:26.470
I'm sure you got
an excellent explanation

10:26.539 --> 10:29.239
for obstructing us from going
after our murder suspect.

10:29.308 --> 10:31.375
I think it's
a pretty damn good one.

10:32.812 --> 10:35.713
Wendy's my daughter, Dwayne.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:45.197 --> 10:47.765
You want to explain how you
broke into our computer network?

10:47.833 --> 10:49.566
Mm. Last time I
worked with you,

10:49.635 --> 10:51.635
I got pretty intimate
with the system here.

10:51.704 --> 10:53.637
Built myself a back door
for a rainy day.

10:53.706 --> 10:55.105
Just seemed
easier that way.

10:55.174 --> 10:56.941
Just a felony that way, too.

10:57.009 --> 11:00.144
You should thank me for finding
weaknesses in your security.

11:01.447 --> 11:02.780
Which you're gonna fix.

11:02.848 --> 11:04.415
Yeah, D., I am.

11:04.483 --> 11:06.317
But I'm gonna help
my daughter first.

11:06.385 --> 11:08.225
Yeah, how exactly
is Wendy Cotts your daughter?

11:08.704 --> 11:11.238
Well, Sebastian,
when a man and a woman

11:11.307 --> 11:12.473
really love each other...

11:12.541 --> 11:14.141
Don't.

11:14.210 --> 11:17.344
Although, you know,
technically, in this case,

11:17.413 --> 11:18.579
there was no woman.

11:18.648 --> 11:20.581
Technically, that's impossible.

11:20.650 --> 11:23.484
You know, my lifestyle
was not conducive

11:23.552 --> 11:24.918
to settling down,

11:24.987 --> 11:26.898
and you don't want to
shuffle off this mortal coil

11:26.922 --> 11:28.889
without leaving a legacy.

11:30.259 --> 11:33.927
I made a sperm donation,
and Wendy's the result of that.

11:33.996 --> 11:35.407
Oh, okay, so she's not
really your daughter.

11:35.431 --> 11:36.675
I'm gonna ignore
your microaggression

11:36.699 --> 11:38.132
about my alternative parenting.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.834
I wasn't there the first
22 years of her life...

11:40.903 --> 11:43.871
Which is the definition
of parenting.

11:43.939 --> 11:47.074
However, we share 50%
of our DNA.

11:47.143 --> 11:48.320
How can you be sure
that she's innocent

11:48.344 --> 11:49.276
if you don't even know her?

11:49.345 --> 11:51.311
I'm sure, and I do know her.

11:51.380 --> 11:53.714
Okay, I got curious
a few years ago,

11:53.783 --> 11:55.149
and I tracked her down.
All right?

11:55.217 --> 11:56.984
And she wanted nothing
to do with me,

11:57.053 --> 11:59.453
but I've kept tabs on her
digitally ever since.

11:59.522 --> 12:01.021
And I look out for her.

12:01.090 --> 12:02.367
Which is the definition
of stalking.

12:02.391 --> 12:03.991
Okay.
All right. Hey, Elvis.

12:04.060 --> 12:04.611
Yeah.
You. What did I do to you?

12:04.611 --> 12:05.394
Come here, come here.

12:05.395 --> 12:07.795
When was the last
time you saw Wendy?

12:11.794 --> 12:14.594
Three years ago
was the first time,

12:14.663 --> 12:16.730
the last time and the only time.

12:16.799 --> 12:18.365
Elvis, what the...

12:18.400 --> 12:20.767
- Wendy's had some issues.
- She's a convicted hacker.

12:20.836 --> 12:22.836
That was a youthful
indiscretion,

12:22.905 --> 12:24.371
but she's turned
her life around.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.173
Bottom line,

12:26.241 --> 12:28.175
Bertrands aren't killers.

12:28.243 --> 12:29.683
We have evidence
that says otherwise.

12:29.745 --> 12:31.611
Do you have any idea
where she could be?

12:31.680 --> 12:33.447
- No idea. Hand to God.
- Elvis.

12:33.515 --> 12:36.016
You want us to help
your daughter or not?

12:36.085 --> 12:37.684
Yes.

12:37.753 --> 12:39.297
Then you got to start
telling the truth.

12:39.321 --> 12:40.854
Then you got to
look out for her.

12:40.923 --> 12:42.556
Okay.

12:42.624 --> 12:45.225
Wendy moves around a lot,

12:45.294 --> 12:48.962
but lately she's been crashing
at a friend's house.

12:49.031 --> 12:51.098
- Bobbi Quells.
- Send me the address.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.433
- Sebastian and I will meet Lasalle there.
- Whoa.

12:53.502 --> 12:54.646
Don't you have
a flight to catch?

12:54.670 --> 12:56.070
Yeah, well, it's gonna
have to wait,

12:56.105 --> 12:57.849
and, Gregorio, you need
to keep an eye on Elvis.

12:57.873 --> 12:58.972
Yeah, keep an eye on him.

12:59.041 --> 13:01.074
Hey.

13:01.143 --> 13:02.976
Let's order tacos.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.146
I'm just postponing
for 24 hours.

13:06.215 --> 13:08.748
I'm gonna be
at the recital.

13:10.185 --> 13:12.452
No, nothing will stop me,
I promise, Laurel.

13:13.689 --> 13:15.622
Okay? Ok...

13:15.691 --> 13:17.457
Yeah, I love you.

13:17.526 --> 13:19.226
She's not buying it, is she?

13:19.294 --> 13:20.927
She's convinced
I'm gonna cancel.

13:20.996 --> 13:22.273
You should just get
on that flight tonight.

13:22.297 --> 13:23.630
We can handle the case.

13:23.699 --> 13:25.765
Not the case I'm worried about;
it's Elvis.

13:25.834 --> 13:28.068
I'm the only one he trusts,
possibly in the world.

13:28.137 --> 13:30.103
Well, let's find
this Wendy Cotts,

13:30.172 --> 13:32.873
get this over with quick,
get you to New York.

13:37.412 --> 13:40.046
NCIS.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.849
Drawers are empty,

13:42.918 --> 13:45.585
no suitcases,
and the coffee pot is still hot.

13:45.654 --> 13:47.254
Whoever was here fled quickly.

13:47.322 --> 13:49.267
What do we know about
Wendy's friend Bobbi Quells?

13:49.291 --> 13:50.702
Looks like they were
more than friends.

13:50.726 --> 13:52.592
Found these
on the side table.

13:52.661 --> 13:54.294
Okay, so they were close.

13:54.363 --> 13:55.962
Means they could've
run off together.

13:56.031 --> 13:57.697
Bobbi a hacker, too?

13:57.766 --> 14:00.133
Hannah did a background check.
Bobbi develops gaming apps.

14:00.202 --> 14:02.002
Runs her own
business.

14:02.070 --> 14:03.715
Well, that would explain
the commercial cables here.

14:03.739 --> 14:05.372
And the Internet
connection, too.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.743
I mean, all this stuff
is top of the line.

14:06.767 --> 14:07.942
Anything useful?

14:07.943 --> 14:09.809
Running some kind
of a code here.

14:09.878 --> 14:12.379
But this-this isn't
for gaming software.

14:12.447 --> 14:14.381
This is some kind of
a-a predictive algorithm.

14:14.449 --> 14:16.361
- Predicting what?
- It's randomly generating numbers,

14:16.385 --> 14:18.985
and then it's spitting them
back out in groupings of six.

14:19.054 --> 14:21.354
It's using a lot of power
to do it, too.

14:21.423 --> 14:22.622
What's it mean?

14:22.691 --> 14:25.792
Think I may know.
I found these

14:25.861 --> 14:27.694
in the trashcan.

14:27.763 --> 14:29.496
Hundreds of lottery tickets.

14:29.565 --> 14:33.567
All from last week's drawing,
the one that Tyrone Gibson won.

14:33.635 --> 14:35.902
I'll be damned.

14:35.971 --> 14:37.804
Wendy found a way
to rig the lottery.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.474
How's that even possible?

14:41.543 --> 14:43.743
Lottery numbers are drawn
completely randomly.

14:43.812 --> 14:45.912
Well, there's no such thing
as completely random.

14:45.981 --> 14:48.259
I mean, the closest that humans
and computers have gotten to

14:48.283 --> 14:50.850
is pseudorandom, but even
that's not really random.

14:50.919 --> 14:52.686
What's pseudorandom?

14:52.754 --> 14:54.888
Uh, well, most of today's
lotteries use software

14:54.957 --> 14:57.402
running mathematical equations
to approximate random sequences.

14:57.426 --> 14:58.436
Meaning someone
can predict them?

14:58.460 --> 14:59.759
All you need is

14:59.828 --> 15:01.372
the seed number
that the lottery starts with,

15:01.396 --> 15:02.562
which is hackable.

15:02.631 --> 15:04.664
Yeah, no,
still don't understand.

15:04.733 --> 15:06.733
All right, look, all you
got to know is that,

15:06.802 --> 15:09.402
with the right algorithm
and a big enough computer,

15:09.471 --> 15:12.872
you can reduce the odds
from one in, say, 300 million

15:12.941 --> 15:15.375
to one in 500. Then you go out,
you buy 500 lottery tickets,

15:15.444 --> 15:17.677
one of them's a winner.
That's what Wendy's been doing.

15:17.746 --> 15:19.446
Yeah, and I couldn't be prouder.

15:19.514 --> 15:21.715
- I'm bursting over here.
- Yeah, don't be too proud.

15:21.783 --> 15:24.884
Wendy's defrauding the system
to get rich.

15:24.953 --> 15:26.886
Okay, she's still
a murder suspect.

15:26.955 --> 15:28.989
- Actually, I'm not sure if that's true.
- No.

15:29.024 --> 15:31.064
- I mean, yeah, she's a murder suspect.
- No. Buddy.

15:31.093 --> 15:33.360
But I don't know
if she's trying to get rich.

15:33.428 --> 15:35.762
So, we've been scanning
these hard drives.

15:35.831 --> 15:37.964
Found the last four
seed numbers that Wendy input.

15:38.033 --> 15:40.600
They coincide with
the winning numbers

15:40.669 --> 15:42.102
from some recent jackpots.

15:42.170 --> 15:43.570
Single mother
social worker,

15:43.639 --> 15:45.305
old lady in
assisted living,

15:45.340 --> 15:47.274
a parish priest,
and Tyrone.

15:47.342 --> 15:48.708
Wendy's not making money at all.

15:48.777 --> 15:50.610
Wow, she is Robin Hood.

15:50.679 --> 15:51.999
She's getting
the winning numbers,

15:52.047 --> 15:53.613
then she's giving them
to needy folks.

15:53.682 --> 15:55.482
Who needs MIT
when you got brains

15:55.550 --> 15:57.117
and a heart
like that kid?

15:57.185 --> 15:59.486
Or she could be taking
her new toy out for a test run.

15:59.554 --> 16:01.454
I mean, all these jackpots
are $100,000 or less.

16:01.523 --> 16:02.989
Could be waiting
for a big score.

16:03.058 --> 16:04.291
Wendy's not a crook!

16:04.359 --> 16:05.825
Whether or not
she's making money,

16:05.894 --> 16:08.306
this is still a crime, Elvis,
and Tyrone's dead because of it.

16:08.330 --> 16:09.507
Yeah, maybe he
figured out what she

16:09.531 --> 16:10.830
was up to, tried to stop her.

16:10.899 --> 16:12.143
Then she corners him
in the middle of

16:12.167 --> 16:13.478
the street and pumps him
full of lead?

16:13.502 --> 16:15.235
Then ran off with
her girlfriend. Yes.

16:15.304 --> 16:16.770
Okay, that's what it looks like.

16:16.838 --> 16:18.238
Loretta finished
her autopsy.

16:18.307 --> 16:21.341
I'm gonna see
what she found.

16:21.410 --> 16:23.009
Dwayne.

16:23.078 --> 16:24.224
I'm going with you.

16:24.248 --> 16:25.846
Yeah, well, getting
autopsy results

16:25.847 --> 16:27.447
is part of the official
investigation.

16:27.516 --> 16:30.950
- For the official investigators.
- Right.

16:31.019 --> 16:32.419
Which you are not.

16:32.487 --> 16:35.955
Hear me out, D. Listen.
I won't get in the way.

16:36.024 --> 16:37.724
I won't be any trouble.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.193
She's my only daughter.

16:45.167 --> 16:46.433
Just say yes already.

16:46.501 --> 16:48.268
I can't stand these
puppy dog eyes. Please.

16:49.338 --> 16:51.871
- Let's go.
- Okay.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.608
Thanks for letting me
tag along.

16:55.677 --> 16:57.310
I know you're
worried about Wendy.

16:57.379 --> 16:59.045
But you're just
here to observe.

16:59.114 --> 17:00.613
- Let me sort it out.
- Yeah.

17:00.682 --> 17:02.515
Hey, enough about me
and my problems.

17:02.584 --> 17:04.184
Let's talk about you, D.

17:04.252 --> 17:06.618
How you been
since you were shot?

17:06.688 --> 17:08.154
I'm doing okay, Elvis.

17:08.223 --> 17:11.523
You sure? No more
of those wacky visions?

17:11.593 --> 17:13.960
How could you
possibly know...?

17:14.029 --> 17:15.494
Are you insinuating
that I accessed

17:15.564 --> 17:17.324
your personal e-mail
and your medical records

17:17.366 --> 17:18.964
just to keep tabs on you?
- Did you?

17:19.034 --> 17:21.166
If I did, it's because I care.

17:21.236 --> 17:23.737
My therapist says that hacking
is my love language.

17:25.773 --> 17:28.208
Some people just
pick up the phone.

17:28.276 --> 17:30.310
Wendy was the same way
when she found out

17:30.379 --> 17:31.789
that I was brute-forcing
her computer.

17:31.813 --> 17:34.214
Oh, my gosh.
She went ballistic.

17:34.282 --> 17:35.582
And we're done
talking about me.

17:35.650 --> 17:37.050
I don't know, man.

17:37.119 --> 17:38.651
Oh, God. I don't know
what I'm doing.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.431
I-I, you know, I'm trying
to look out for that girl.

17:40.455 --> 17:41.566
I'm trying
to protect that girl.

17:41.590 --> 17:43.723
Trying to make up
for all this lost time.

17:43.792 --> 17:46.059
Yeah, that's not
how it works, Elvis.

17:46.128 --> 17:47.861
You got to give
kids space.

17:47.929 --> 17:49.095
Let them come to you.

17:49.164 --> 17:50.730
Listen to what
they have to say.

17:50.799 --> 17:52.832
Well, you can pull that off

17:52.901 --> 17:55.668
because, let's be honest,
you're dad of the year.

17:55.737 --> 17:58.505
I've had my wins and
plenty of losses.

17:58.573 --> 18:00.507
- Now, come on.
- Hey.

18:00.575 --> 18:03.376
I know you're sacrificing time
with Laurel to help me out,

18:03.445 --> 18:04.978
and I will never forget it.

18:06.014 --> 18:07.614
Okay.

18:07.682 --> 18:09.916
Let's see what
Loretta found.

18:10.952 --> 18:12.619
The slug we pulled from Tyrone

18:12.687 --> 18:15.054
came back a .38-caliber
Smith & Wesson.

18:15.123 --> 18:18.358
Which would match the
weapon Wendy was holding

18:18.427 --> 18:19.793
when she fled the scene.

18:19.861 --> 18:21.428
I'm not buying it.

18:21.496 --> 18:23.363
And, unfortunately,
there's more.

18:23.432 --> 18:27.167
DNA from Tyrone's fingernails
is also a match to Wendy Cotts.

18:28.203 --> 18:29.436
No way.

18:29.504 --> 18:31.104
It's got to be a mistake.

18:31.173 --> 18:32.784
- Don't tend to make those.
- Listen,

18:32.808 --> 18:34.941
I'm telling you,
I know Wendy.

18:35.010 --> 18:36.876
I don't... I don't
<i>know</i> know her,

18:36.945 --> 18:38.912
but I know enough
about her, okay?

18:38.980 --> 18:40.213
She's into social justice.

18:40.282 --> 18:41.915
She looks out for
the little guy.

18:41.983 --> 18:44.150
She's a vegetarian,
for God's sakes!

18:44.219 --> 18:47.287
She also stole $200,000
from the state lottery

18:47.355 --> 18:48.888
and ran from Tyrone's
crime scene

18:48.957 --> 18:51.224
with the murder weapon
in her hand.

18:54.062 --> 18:55.795
Sebastian, what
do you have?

18:55.864 --> 18:58.631
I got a bead
on Wendy's location.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.111
While we were trying
to track her down,

19:00.135 --> 19:01.345
I saw that she went
online again.

19:01.369 --> 19:02.735
What's she doing?

19:02.804 --> 19:03.948
Uh, she's accessing
her algorithm.

19:03.972 --> 19:05.483
She's using a lot of power
to do it, too.

19:05.507 --> 19:07.173
She needs
a gigabit pro fiber line

19:07.242 --> 19:08.508
to make the thing work.

19:08.577 --> 19:09.687
Were you able
to trace her signal?

19:09.711 --> 19:11.244
Of course he can't.

19:11.313 --> 19:13.646
- She'll cover her tracks.
- Yeah, but I am able

19:13.715 --> 19:14.981
to trace her power signal.

19:15.050 --> 19:16.490
Now, there's only a handful
of places

19:16.518 --> 19:18.284
in New Orleans
with the necessary bandwidth

19:18.353 --> 19:20.720
available to the public,
and only one of them

19:20.789 --> 19:23.089
was cofounded
by Wendy's girlfriend.

19:24.092 --> 19:25.291
What is Zerses Den?

19:25.360 --> 19:26.826
<i>It's a gaming club.</i>

19:26.895 --> 19:28.595
You pay a monthly fee,

19:28.663 --> 19:30.308
and you can play
until your heart's content.

19:30.332 --> 19:32.131
Well, can't you do
that at home for free?

19:32.200 --> 19:33.466
Well, according to Sebastian,

19:33.535 --> 19:35.068
it's a geek's way
of meeting people.

19:35.136 --> 19:36.503
- Hooking up.
- Mm.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.040
♪﻿﻿﻿♪

19:44.613 --> 19:46.546
Yeah. It seems, uh...

19:46.615 --> 19:48.381
real social.

19:48.450 --> 19:50.783
Eyes peeled for Wendy and Bobbi.

19:50.852 --> 19:53.019
Got it.

20:04.533 --> 20:06.566
Wendy Cotts?

20:06.635 --> 20:08.301
You're a cop?
NCIS.

20:08.370 --> 20:10.470
I need you to put your hands
where I can see them.

20:10.539 --> 20:12.016
- I didn't kill Tyrone.
- That's okay.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.351
We'll talk about it
when you come in.

20:13.375 --> 20:14.785
Like I haven't
heard that before.

20:14.809 --> 20:16.187
You've already decided
that I'm guilty.

20:16.211 --> 20:17.744
I don't operate like that.

20:17.812 --> 20:19.479
That's how all cops operate.

20:19.548 --> 20:22.081
I get it. You're scared.
But we can help you.

20:22.150 --> 20:24.150
"We"?

20:24.219 --> 20:26.319
There's a lot of people
who are worried about you.

20:26.388 --> 20:28.821
Now show me your hands,
and we'll fix all of this.

20:28.890 --> 20:31.524
Why should I trust you?

20:31.593 --> 20:34.327
Because your dad would kill me
if anything happened to you.

20:34.396 --> 20:37.564
My dad? I don't
have a dad, lady.

20:37.632 --> 20:39.098
Just an obnoxious sperm donor

20:39.167 --> 20:41.568
who won't leave me alone
and clearly is a rat, too.

20:41.636 --> 20:43.570
Gregorio, gun.
Don't move.

20:43.638 --> 20:45.171
She's got something
else in her hand.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.151
- Just let me explain.
- Empty your hands first.

20:47.175 --> 20:48.675
Explain after.

20:48.743 --> 20:50.577
- Afraid that's not gonna happen.
- No!

20:57.586 --> 20:58.818
Wendy's gone.

21:02.724 --> 21:04.135
I can't believe
you let her get away.

21:04.159 --> 21:05.303
We're never gonna find her now.

21:05.327 --> 21:06.337
Whoa, we didn't let
anything, okay?

21:06.361 --> 21:07.860
She pulled
the same trick on us

21:07.929 --> 21:09.507
you pulled on us three years ago.
- Yeah, she did.

21:09.531 --> 21:10.841
Yeah. And I'm tickled
pink about it.

21:10.865 --> 21:12.732
But you should have
known better.

21:12.801 --> 21:15.368
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice...

21:15.437 --> 21:17.203
Go ahead, say it.
Finish the sentence.

21:17.272 --> 21:19.205
- I thought you guys were pros.
- Elvis.

21:19.274 --> 21:21.107
Dwayne.
Take ten.

21:21.176 --> 21:23.610
Go get yourself
some coffee.

21:23.678 --> 21:24.678
Decaf.

21:27.282 --> 21:30.149
He's right. It's not gonna be
easy to track her down again.

21:30.218 --> 21:31.362
I don't think
we're gonna have to.

21:31.386 --> 21:32.530
Think she's gonna come to us.

21:32.554 --> 21:33.753
Why would she do that?

21:33.822 --> 21:35.288
Last night's winning lotto draw.

21:35.357 --> 21:38.091
Quarter of a million dollars.
Wendy used her algorithm

21:38.159 --> 21:40.093
- to predict the winning numbers?
- Yeah.

21:40.161 --> 21:41.601
And any ticket
that's worth over $600

21:41.663 --> 21:43.796
has to be redeemed
at the redemption office.

21:43.865 --> 21:46.232
There's only one of those
in New Orleans.

21:50.672 --> 21:52.772
- Okay, comms check.
- Check.

21:52.841 --> 21:54.841
And while we're checking,
I'd like to go on record

21:54.909 --> 21:56.776
praising the civility
of this stakeout.

21:56.845 --> 21:58.389
The sun is out, and
the coffee's strong.

21:58.413 --> 21:59.579
All right.

21:59.648 --> 22:01.447
Levels are good.
Duly noted, Gregorio.

22:01.516 --> 22:02.615
Oh, look alive.

22:02.684 --> 22:03.616
Bogey at one o'clock.

22:03.685 --> 22:05.852
Oh, I got eyes on her.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.360
Okay, let's go nice and easy.

22:07.422 --> 22:09.133
- We don't want to spook her this time.
- Right.

22:09.157 --> 22:11.424
All right, you got it.

22:14.362 --> 22:16.029
- Wendy!
- She's running!

22:28.710 --> 22:30.054
- Let me go!
- You all right?

22:30.078 --> 22:31.878
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Let me go! Let me go!

22:33.081 --> 22:35.214
We got one problem.

22:36.451 --> 22:39.252
This is not Wendy Cotts.

22:48.188 --> 22:50.555
I don't know where Wendy is.

22:50.624 --> 22:53.558
Come on,
she was your girlfriend.

22:53.627 --> 22:55.560
You were living together.

22:55.629 --> 22:57.061
She was crashing
at my place.

22:57.130 --> 22:58.530
That's all that was.

22:58.598 --> 23:00.298
Liar, liar.
She is lying.

23:00.367 --> 23:01.811
All right, Pride said
that you could observe,

23:01.835 --> 23:03.368
so let's...
you know, let's observe.

23:03.437 --> 23:05.970
She was using your computer
to operate an algorithm

23:06.039 --> 23:07.472
predicting winning
lotto numbers.

23:07.541 --> 23:09.018
Like the numbers
on this ticket

23:09.042 --> 23:10.542
you were trying to cash in

23:10.610 --> 23:11.943
for $250,000.

23:12.012 --> 23:13.412
We know you were
with Wendy.

23:13.447 --> 23:15.580
We know she was gaming
for big bucks.

23:15.649 --> 23:19.150
And Tyrone Gibson was
shot to death because of it.

23:19.219 --> 23:21.352
And you could be next
if you don't talk to us.

23:22.622 --> 23:24.956
The lottery thing was all Wendy.

23:27.327 --> 23:28.504
You're setting my daughter up.
You hear me?

23:28.528 --> 23:30.139
You're setting her up. Hey, hey!
Hey, all right.

23:30.163 --> 23:32.041
Listen. Now, listen, man.
What are you gonna do about it?

23:32.065 --> 23:34.199
Just back away
from the mirror, okay?

23:35.469 --> 23:36.968
Old pipes. Keep going.

23:38.338 --> 23:39.938
Wendy thought the lottery
was a scam.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.606
Tax on the poor.

23:41.675 --> 23:43.441
She said
she could fix it.

23:43.510 --> 23:47.846
Sounded crazy to me, but then
I realized it was for real.

23:47.914 --> 23:49.447
She could make it work.

23:49.516 --> 23:51.416
She wanted
to rig the system

23:51.485 --> 23:53.685
so that deserving people
would win, like Tyrone?

23:53.753 --> 23:55.453
Guy was a mentor
to troubled kids.

23:55.522 --> 23:56.955
Helped Wendy straighten out.

23:57.023 --> 23:58.590
Least she could do
was give back.

23:58.658 --> 24:00.959
She was angry with him
the night he died.

24:01.027 --> 24:02.327
'Cause he broke the rules.

24:02.395 --> 24:05.096
Don't spend crazy,
don't draw attention.

24:05.165 --> 24:08.199
He got excited
with all that cash.

24:08.268 --> 24:10.935
Is that why Tyrone ended up
with a bullet in his chest?

24:14.074 --> 24:15.840
Bullet's because of me.

24:15.909 --> 24:17.442
Uh, my club's failing.

24:17.511 --> 24:19.043
Overhead is ridiculous.

24:19.112 --> 24:21.646
I needed money to
keep it running.

24:21.715 --> 24:23.414
No bank would help.

24:23.483 --> 24:25.149
You went to the street?

24:25.218 --> 24:28.119
Loan shark named Ace Rogers.

24:28.188 --> 24:30.355
Needed 50K to
pay the bills.

24:30.423 --> 24:32.991
I was sure it would
all turn around.

24:33.059 --> 24:34.292
It didn't.

24:34.361 --> 24:35.493
He called in the chit?

24:35.562 --> 24:37.729
He was gonna take my club,
hurt me.

24:37.797 --> 24:40.899
I was scared, so I told him
about the lotto hack.

24:40.967 --> 24:43.701
Needed to prove to him
that I was good for the money.

24:43.770 --> 24:46.070
Said Wendy would
make sure I'd win.

24:46.139 --> 24:47.372
But Ace wanted more.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.173
He wanted to be part
of the scheme.

24:49.242 --> 24:52.477
Why settle for a golden egg when
you get to have the whole goose?

24:52.546 --> 24:53.578
You told Wendy?

24:53.613 --> 24:54.913
She was pissed.

24:54.981 --> 24:56.915
Refused to help Ace.

24:56.983 --> 24:58.550
He went after her
to change her mind.

24:58.618 --> 25:01.653
Tyrone got in the way.

25:01.721 --> 25:03.087
Where's Wendy now?

25:03.156 --> 25:05.523
I don't know.

25:05.592 --> 25:07.525
She said she'd give me
that ticket

25:07.594 --> 25:10.662
to clear my debt, help me run...

25:10.730 --> 25:12.730
then broke up with me.

25:14.634 --> 25:16.634
If you find her...

25:17.837 --> 25:19.804
...tell her I'm sorry.

25:22.909 --> 25:23.918
I'm not one to say

25:23.919 --> 25:26.353
I told you so,
but I did tell you so.

25:26.421 --> 25:26.952
My daughter is innocent.

25:26.976 --> 25:29.123
Ah, that's a strong
term for what she is,

25:29.124 --> 25:30.457
but she's not a murderer.

25:30.525 --> 25:32.292
It's time to call off
the dogs, D.

25:32.361 --> 25:34.361
The manhunt for Wendy is over.

25:34.429 --> 25:36.396
She's not
a suspect anymore,

25:36.465 --> 25:38.231
but she is a target.

25:38.300 --> 25:41.835
Ace Rogers is after her, and
he's already killed one person.

25:41.903 --> 25:43.403
She's my daughter.

25:43.472 --> 25:46.339
If she wants to stay gone,
you'll never find her.

25:46.408 --> 25:48.241
Well, we need to find
Ace Rogers, then.

25:48.310 --> 25:50.176
Hey, King.

25:50.245 --> 25:51.845
I remember Ace
from my NOPD days.

25:51.913 --> 25:53.546
- Yeah.
- He runs his outfit

25:53.615 --> 25:55.215
in a Chinese restaurant
on Magazine.

25:55.283 --> 25:56.383
Gear up. Let's go.

25:56.451 --> 25:57.650
Okay.

26:00.088 --> 26:02.255
No, Elvis. - Hear me out.
Nothing to hear.

26:02.324 --> 26:03.768
- You're worried about Wendy. I get it.
- Yeah.

26:03.792 --> 26:05.825
But this is police work.

26:05.894 --> 26:08.995
All right? We will handle it,
and we will take Ace down.

26:19.441 --> 26:22.575
I got visual on Ace
and about three others, Dwayne.

26:22.644 --> 26:24.077
They're armed.

26:24.146 --> 26:26.212
I'll call NOPD for backup.

26:26.281 --> 26:27.914
We run this smooth.

26:27.983 --> 26:29.716
No complications.

26:29.785 --> 26:32.685
Uh, boss, we may have
one complication.

26:32.754 --> 26:35.221
Wendy's heading
into the lion's den.

26:35.290 --> 26:37.223
Well, stop her
before she gets there.

26:37.292 --> 26:38.391
Uh, we can't.

26:38.460 --> 26:41.194
She's already in.

26:41.263 --> 26:43.363
We move in now,
it could be a hostage situation.

26:43.432 --> 26:45.031
Yeah, we don't, could
be a murder scene.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.100
We need ears inside.

26:46.134 --> 26:48.234
I might be able to help.

26:48.303 --> 26:50.069
Ace, uh, upgraded
the restaurant recently.

26:50.138 --> 26:51.638
Everything's wired now.
That means

26:51.706 --> 26:54.107
Wi-Fi controls the temperature,
the security,

26:54.176 --> 26:55.987
even the entertainment system.
I might be able to hack in,

26:56.011 --> 26:57.644
and we can hear
everything inside.

26:57.712 --> 27:00.146
- All right, go. Well, get to it, Sebastian.
- Uh, yeah.

27:00.215 --> 27:03.116
What is it I always
say about people, Little Rick?

27:03.185 --> 27:04.717
That they never cease to amaze.

27:04.786 --> 27:06.753
They never do.

27:06.822 --> 27:08.488
After our disagreement
last night,

27:08.557 --> 27:10.723
you got chutzpah
walking into my joint.

27:10.792 --> 27:12.392
I'm here to talk business.

27:12.461 --> 27:13.626
50 million?

27:14.896 --> 27:16.140
Tonight's Mammoth-Money drawing.

27:16.164 --> 27:17.564
I'm gonna help you win.

27:17.632 --> 27:19.566
<i>Y'all hearing all this?</i>

27:19.634 --> 27:21.012
Yeah, we're hearing it,
Christopher.

27:21.036 --> 27:22.402
Wendy's making a deal.

27:22.471 --> 27:24.404
Ace killed Tyrone,
tried to kill Bobbi.

27:24.473 --> 27:25.972
Why is she dealing with him?

27:26.041 --> 27:27.518
She might think
it's her only way out.

27:27.542 --> 27:29.275
Want to give me
the winning ticket

27:29.344 --> 27:30.844
out of the kindness
of your heart?

27:30.912 --> 27:33.446
No, out of a sense
of self-preservation,

27:33.515 --> 27:35.648
so you don't kill
any more of my friends?

27:35.717 --> 27:38.818
What happened to your knight
in shining armor was his fault.

27:38.887 --> 27:41.588
Maybe. But it was your gun.

27:42.858 --> 27:44.757
What are you trying
to do here?

27:44.826 --> 27:46.192
Buy my freedom.

27:46.261 --> 27:49.662
- You're not selling? I'll leave.
- No, no, hold.

27:49.731 --> 27:51.531
You're not going anywhere

27:51.600 --> 27:54.334
until you tell me
how you gonna make me rich.

27:57.873 --> 27:59.639
It's all in this computer.

27:59.708 --> 28:01.007
But first,

28:01.076 --> 28:02.675
you have to promise
you won't shoot me

28:02.744 --> 28:04.110
like you did Tyrone.

28:04.179 --> 28:05.712
She's not trying to make a deal.

28:05.780 --> 28:07.313
She's trying to get
a confession.

28:07.382 --> 28:09.382
Yeah, if Ace figures that out,
he's gonna kill her.

28:09.417 --> 28:10.683
We got to go in there.

28:10.752 --> 28:12.032
He's right. We got to stop this.

28:13.121 --> 28:15.722
You show me,
then we'll see what happens.

28:15.790 --> 28:17.557
She won't be able to show you.

28:17.626 --> 28:19.192
Elvis.

28:19.261 --> 28:20.621
Who are you?
How'd you get in here?

28:21.863 --> 28:23.207
Picked the lock
on the service entrance.

28:23.231 --> 28:25.398
I'm the guy that
invented that algorithm.

28:25.467 --> 28:26.966
That is not true.

28:27.035 --> 28:28.401
Hush, sweetie.
Let your dad talk.

28:28.470 --> 28:30.169
Oh, what, you brought
your daddy with you?

28:30.238 --> 28:31.571
He's not my dad.

28:31.640 --> 28:33.618
We need to get in there
before they both get killed.

28:33.642 --> 28:36.242
Lasalle, Sebastian,
you got the back.

28:36.311 --> 28:37.644
Let's go.

28:37.712 --> 28:39.223
She's a good kid.
She's a little mixed up.

28:39.247 --> 28:40.513
But she took my algorithm

28:40.582 --> 28:42.582
out for a spin
without my permission.

28:42.651 --> 28:44.428
- What are you doing?
- I'm the only one that can handle it.

28:44.452 --> 28:47.220
Hey, quiet! I got to figure out
which of you I believe

28:47.289 --> 28:48.922
and which one I'm gonna shoot.

28:48.990 --> 28:50.557
This was your big plan?

28:50.625 --> 28:51.858
No, I'm stalling.

28:51.927 --> 28:53.807
- What do you want? What...
- NCIS! Nobody move!

28:55.630 --> 28:57.297
Get down!

29:03.505 --> 29:04.804
Come on.

29:10.078 --> 29:12.245
Come out, nice and slow!

29:12.314 --> 29:13.314
You all right?

29:13.348 --> 29:14.514
I'm fine.

29:14.583 --> 29:15.648
Okay.

29:24.793 --> 29:26.726
- You all right? Everybody?
- Yeah.

29:26.795 --> 29:28.628
Yeah, King,
but we got a problem.

29:28.697 --> 29:29.862
Ace is gone.

29:29.931 --> 29:31.931
And he took Elvis with him.

29:42.075 --> 29:44.175
Ace Rogers kidnapped
your father...

29:44.244 --> 29:44.900
He's not my father.

29:44.901 --> 29:46.767
...and is gonna try
to use him to rig

29:46.835 --> 29:48.101
today's $50 million lottery.

29:48.170 --> 29:49.703
And then he'll
probably kill him.

29:49.772 --> 29:51.049
Elvis shouldn't have
gone in the restaurant.

29:51.073 --> 29:52.550
I was recording the whole
thing on my laptop.

29:52.574 --> 29:53.574
I had it handled.

29:53.609 --> 29:55.309
Trying to get Ace
to confess to murder--

29:55.377 --> 29:57.277
not much of a plan.

29:57.346 --> 29:58.712
But it would've worked.

29:58.781 --> 30:00.881
Elvis was trying
to save you.

30:00.950 --> 30:03.317
If he hadn't,
you would be the kidnap victim.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.319
Do you know how I met Elvis?

30:05.387 --> 30:08.689
He shows up at MIT my freshman
year and announces he's my dad.

30:08.757 --> 30:11.191
Not only that, but he tells
me he rigged admissions

30:11.260 --> 30:13.293
to make sure
I got in on a full ride.

30:13.362 --> 30:15.128
That why you dropped out?

30:15.197 --> 30:17.331
I do something,
it's on my terms.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.566
You're acting tough,
but we know you're not.

30:19.635 --> 30:21.168
You gave those lottery tickets

30:21.236 --> 30:23.170
to those who you thought
were more deserving.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.072
Yeah, that's because I do
my own thing.

30:25.140 --> 30:27.107
Do your own thing, huh?

30:28.644 --> 30:30.544
How'd that work out
for Tyrone Gibson?

30:35.651 --> 30:38.018
Tyrone was trying
to save me, too.

30:38.087 --> 30:40.020
Because Ace
came looking for you?

30:40.089 --> 30:41.688
Followed me
to the club.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.890
Pulled a gun. Tyrone pushed him
out of the way,

30:43.959 --> 30:45.258
fought Ace, and...

30:45.327 --> 30:46.893
gun went off.

30:46.962 --> 30:48.762
How'd it end up in your hand?

30:48.831 --> 30:52.032
I grabbed it after Tyrone
struggled with Ace.

30:52.101 --> 30:53.734
And I ran.

30:54.937 --> 30:56.403
No more running.

30:56.472 --> 30:58.505
It's time to face
what's going on.

30:58.574 --> 30:59.940
We need to find Ace and Elvis.

31:00.009 --> 31:01.575
You're all we got.

31:06.181 --> 31:09.016
Elvis will hack the lottery,
get their seed number,

31:09.084 --> 31:10.917
and use the laptop
for today's drawing.

31:10.986 --> 31:13.186
And once he does?

31:13.255 --> 31:14.421
They'll have to buy tickets.

31:14.490 --> 31:16.256
At least 500 to make it work.

31:16.325 --> 31:17.902
Any way to figure out
where they're buying 'em?

31:17.926 --> 31:19.359
Yeah.

31:19.428 --> 31:23.797
But I'm gonna need to break
a few more laws to do it.

31:26.702 --> 31:28.435
<i>We're gonna hack into</i>
<i>the lottery's system</i>

31:28.504 --> 31:30.203
to figure out
their seed number.

31:30.272 --> 31:31.912
Yeah. Then we're gonna
identify the stores

31:31.940 --> 31:33.985
where blocks of tickets with
those numbers are being sold.

31:34.009 --> 31:35.487
They'll have to hit
multiple locations

31:35.511 --> 31:36.543
to purchase the tickets.

31:36.612 --> 31:38.478
Can't buy that many in one spot.

31:38.547 --> 31:39.479
Too suspicious.

31:39.548 --> 31:41.748
- Exactly.
- Talking about six states.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.495
Louisiana's out, since
Ace is a wanted man.

31:43.519 --> 31:45.096
Yeah, and they're gonna need
a redemption center nearby

31:45.120 --> 31:46.053
for when the drawing is over.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.788
Alabama and
Mississippi,

31:47.856 --> 31:49.167
they don't have games.
So that leaves

31:49.191 --> 31:50.702
Florida as the closest.
That's three hours away.

31:50.726 --> 31:51.892
Let's get to it.

31:53.228 --> 31:55.062
Want me to walk you
through the process here?

31:55.130 --> 31:57.008
Uh, yeah, you know,
I haven't committed a felony

31:57.032 --> 31:58.665
in a couple months,
so I'm just gonna

31:58.734 --> 32:00.100
let you do it.

32:00.169 --> 32:01.334
Here.

32:04.573 --> 32:07.507
Hey, I'll let Pride know to
start heading towards Florida.

32:07.576 --> 32:09.054
All right. It's gonna take us
a while to figure out

32:09.078 --> 32:10.455
where these tickets are being sold.
- Okay, well, move fast.

32:10.479 --> 32:13.280
Once Rogers has the money,
Elvis is no use to him.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.082
Okay. I got

32:15.150 --> 32:16.483
the seed number.

32:16.552 --> 32:18.852
Now I'm zeroing in
on block sales.

32:18.921 --> 32:21.988
Wow, you really are a chip
off the old block, aren't you?

32:24.760 --> 32:27.527
<i>Pretty busy here</i>
<i>on jackpot day.</i>

32:27.596 --> 32:29.463
Anyone come in here
and buy more

32:29.531 --> 32:31.531
than normal amount of tickets?
- What's normal?

32:31.600 --> 32:32.966
We get all types.

32:33.035 --> 32:34.035
Stop there.

32:34.069 --> 32:35.836
That's who
we're looking for.

32:35.904 --> 32:37.938
Oh, yeah. That guy.

32:38.006 --> 32:39.840
Bought 100 tickets.
Very specific numbers.

32:39.908 --> 32:41.341
Had me type 'em in.

32:41.410 --> 32:43.176
Keep going.

32:44.413 --> 32:45.979
Freeze it.

32:46.048 --> 32:48.348
What's Elvis doing?

32:48.417 --> 32:50.383
Spends $200 on lotto,

32:50.452 --> 32:52.953
steals a 99-cent bag
of jelly beans?

32:55.057 --> 32:57.357
I think he did more than that.

32:57.426 --> 32:59.326
What's it say, King?

32:59.394 --> 33:01.128
Jackson D.

33:01.196 --> 33:03.063
What's that supposed to be?

33:05.067 --> 33:06.299
I think it's a clue.

33:08.070 --> 33:09.302
Thank you.

33:10.739 --> 33:13.173
Okay, but what does
"Jackson D" mean?

33:13.242 --> 33:15.042
<i>Well, whatever it is,</i>
<i>it's the one hint</i>

33:15.077 --> 33:16.543
that Elvis left
so we can track him.

33:16.612 --> 33:19.282
So, is it a place, a name,
some kind of code?

33:19.375 --> 33:20.708
How about all three?

33:20.777 --> 33:22.088
You found something, Sebastian?

33:22.112 --> 33:23.644
Yeah, so I was looking

33:23.713 --> 33:25.257
through Ace's ledger
from the Chinese restaurant

33:25.281 --> 33:26.714
where he kept
all his open debts.

33:26.783 --> 33:29.350
And I use that term loosely,
'cause this is just

33:29.419 --> 33:32.153
full of bad accounting,
bad penmanship. I mean, these...

33:32.222 --> 33:33.821
columns don't even
balance out. Huh?

33:33.890 --> 33:35.438
Okay. Well, Elvis basically
has an hour left to live.

33:35.439 --> 33:36.463
- Get to the point, Sebastian.
- So...

33:36.464 --> 33:37.464
- Yeah.
- Got it. Okay.

33:37.532 --> 33:38.798
Well, there's
an entry here for

33:38.867 --> 33:40.600
a Jackson D.

33:40.668 --> 33:43.069
And it looks like he owes
about 200k in gambling debts,

33:43.138 --> 33:44.949
and according to this,
he's somewhere near Pensacola.

33:44.973 --> 33:47.273
Yeah, so I looked up the name.
There's a Dirk Jackson

33:47.342 --> 33:48.908
who lives in Gulfport,
Mississippi.

33:48.977 --> 33:50.710
Right, well,
that's not Florida, Sebastian.

33:50.779 --> 33:52.245
Right, but this Dirk Jackson

33:52.313 --> 33:54.647
also owns a sugar refinery
in Pensacola

33:54.716 --> 33:56.482
and loves betting on basketball.

33:56.551 --> 33:58.985
Right, well, look, it's
the best lead we're gonna get.

33:59.054 --> 34:00.853
Send us the address.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.758
Man, this place is charming.

34:05.827 --> 34:07.260
You know, with a paint job

34:07.328 --> 34:08.661
and an industrial
cleaning crew,

34:08.730 --> 34:11.230
tell you what...
- Will you please shut up?

34:11.299 --> 34:12.665
Sorry.

34:12.734 --> 34:15.301
I'm a nervous talker.
Always have been.

34:15.370 --> 34:17.570
Listen, we haven't
discussed my fee yet.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.339
Your fee is
you keep breathing if I win.

34:20.408 --> 34:22.475
You know what happens if I lose.

34:22.543 --> 34:25.411
Trust me, one of those tickets
is worth millions.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.280
All I got to do
is cash it in, right?

34:27.348 --> 34:28.815
Simple as that.
Your debt is cleared,

34:28.882 --> 34:30.616
you get to keep
your family business.

34:30.685 --> 34:31.606
Yeah.

34:31.630 --> 34:33.320
Guess this is
my lucky day, then, huh?

34:33.321 --> 34:34.620
Yeah.

34:34.688 --> 34:37.090
Hey, want a bean? No?

34:39.260 --> 34:40.626
Where can we watch
the drawing?

34:40.695 --> 34:42.161
Take you to my office.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.541
This is the car
Rogers was driving.

34:55.610 --> 34:57.944
I saw it on the gas
station security feed.

34:58.012 --> 34:59.445
Means Elvis must be close.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.981
Lottery results
are announced at 6:00.

35:02.050 --> 35:03.683
We got to move fast.

35:13.294 --> 35:14.460
Are you kidding?

35:14.529 --> 35:16.496
This place is bigger
than Grand Central.

35:16.564 --> 35:18.631
Only the three of us, King.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.466
Could take hours
to find them.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.136
And we got less than four
minutes to save Elvis's life.

35:38.134 --> 35:40.567
We're gonna have to split up,
or we'll never find them.

35:41.971 --> 35:43.971
I'll take the far side.
Okay, Christopher,

35:44.039 --> 35:45.639
just remember,

35:45.708 --> 35:47.808
only shoot if you
have to, all right?

35:47.877 --> 35:49.554
- 'Cause sugar's flammable.
- Might as well be

35:49.578 --> 35:51.845
hunting this jerk
in a fireworks factory.

35:59.655 --> 36:01.655
Get those tickets handy,

36:01.724 --> 36:03.957
because here comes tonight's
winning numbers

36:04.026 --> 36:06.026
for the Mammoth-Money Lotto.

36:06.095 --> 36:07.694
This is actually the...

36:07.763 --> 36:10.097
Come on, lady, enough foreplay.
Get to the numbers.

36:10.166 --> 36:12.166
You know, I-I may have
overdone it on the candy.

36:12.234 --> 36:13.500
You got a restroom nearby?

36:13.569 --> 36:15.009
You're staying
exactly where you are.

36:15.037 --> 36:16.970
You don't understand--
when you're my age,

36:17.039 --> 36:19.373
when you got to go,
you got to go... You're right.

36:19.441 --> 36:21.319
- I'll hold it in.
- All right, I won't keep you

36:21.343 --> 36:22.988
in suspense any longer.
All right, here we go.

36:23.012 --> 36:26.513
For the $50 million jackpot,
here are your numbers.

36:27.550 --> 36:29.449
Four.

11.

that thing, buddy.

36:57.780 --> 37:01.048
Well, they say waiting's
the best part, right?

37:01.116 --> 37:02.850
Just kidding.

37:02.918 --> 37:04.651
All right. The final number

37:04.720 --> 37:06.386
in the Mammoth-Money

37:06.455 --> 37:09.223
$50 million jackpot is...

37:09.291 --> 37:11.225
96.

37:11.293 --> 37:12.826
Holy crap, it worked.

37:12.895 --> 37:14.895
I mean, of course it worked.

37:14.964 --> 37:16.663
Yes! Yes.

37:16.732 --> 37:18.165
This is amazing.

37:18.234 --> 37:19.566
I got to hand it to you.

37:19.635 --> 37:21.201
You know,
I thought this was a scam,

37:21.270 --> 37:23.503
but you and your daughter,
you are artistes.

37:23.572 --> 37:25.005
Yes. What did I tell you?

37:25.074 --> 37:26.206
I knew it, man.

37:26.275 --> 37:28.842
- You know what to do.
- Yeah, just...

37:28.911 --> 37:31.745
Don't even think about
double-crossing me.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.680
Of course not, Ace.

37:48.964 --> 37:50.464
Hey!

37:50.532 --> 37:52.065
I think I better
get going, too.

37:52.134 --> 37:53.934
Maybe I'll catch a
ride with your bud.

37:54.003 --> 37:55.569
Now, Elvis...

37:55.638 --> 37:57.437
we're both adults.
- Mm-mmm.

37:57.506 --> 38:01.475
You need to accept I was
never gonna let you live.

38:02.778 --> 38:06.213
Actually, I just
needed to get here.

Hey!

38:17.359 --> 38:19.126
I got Ace.

What...? Took you long enough.

<i>Four counts of fraud.</i>

39:40.542 --> 39:42.876
- Whoa.
- Felony theft, false representation,

39:42.945 --> 39:46.646
and improperly accessing
a government computer network.

39:46.715 --> 39:48.835
That's a pretty impressive
list for somebody your age.

I got my first felony.

- No.

I'm going away for a long time.

39:56.792 --> 40:00.861
Listen, Wendy.

40:00.929 --> 40:05.032
I know you don't need a dad
or want a dad.

40:05.100 --> 40:07.667
Certainly not me.

40:07.736 --> 40:10.170
And I know being one
is a lot more

40:10.239 --> 40:13.573
than being a sperm donor.

40:13.642 --> 40:15.409
But I do know something
about how hard

40:15.477 --> 40:17.477
it is to keep on the
straight and narrow,

40:17.513 --> 40:20.047
because I've been struggling
with it my whole life.

40:20.149 --> 40:23.083
- Not always succeeding.
- I'm having a moment here, okay?

40:23.152 --> 40:24.951
Please.

in prison.

I won't have to.

40:42.871 --> 40:44.938
'Cause you're not going
to prison, honey.

40:47.376 --> 40:49.609
Turns out there's no
actual evidence

40:49.711 --> 40:51.111
that you scammed
those lotteries.

Somehow...

40:54.049 --> 40:55.949
your laptop got completely wiped

40:56.018 --> 40:58.485

freak accident.

41:00.956 --> 41:02.889
You destroyed my algorithm?

41:02.958 --> 41:05.158
No. I saved you ten years
in prison.

41:05.227 --> 41:06.827
By destroying my life's work.

41:06.895 --> 41:08.895
It took me forever
to design that.

41:08.964 --> 41:10.397
Your words seem harsh,

41:10.466 --> 41:11.676
but in your heart,
you're saying,

41:11.700 --> 41:12.900
"Thank you, Daddy.
I love you."

41:14.903 --> 41:16.955
Does he have an "off" switch?

this family reunion,

41:19.618 --> 41:21.552

41:21.620 --> 41:23.354
Running late
for the airport.

41:23.422 --> 41:25.155
Dwayne.

41:25.224 --> 41:27.124
Say the word,
I'll work some magic

41:27.193 --> 41:28.993

41:37.917 --> 41:39.016
Back at the sugar mill?

41:39.085 --> 41:40.685
Seems to have
gone missing.

- Yeah.

Oh. Whoa.

41:47.460 --> 41:49.026
Huh.

41:49.095 --> 41:51.796
Yeah. I was keeping it safe.

41:51.864 --> 41:54.765
'Cause it's evidence
