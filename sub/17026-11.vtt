00:51.919 --> 00:54.599
(train clattering)

00:54.719 --> 00:56.999
(police siren wailing)

01:05.078 --> 01:06.279
Coming through.

01:06.439 --> 01:07.959
Multiple GSWs to the chest.
Pulseless when we found him.

01:08.159 --> 01:09.919
Two rounds EPI and atrophine.
Move out of
the way, please.

01:10.079 --> 01:11.319
Morris: Call for O-neg.
Prime the infuser.

01:11.519 --> 01:13.119
Hey, what you guys got?
Drug deal
turned shootout.

01:13.279 --> 01:14.879
He got it worst.
Need help?

01:15.079 --> 01:16.319
No.
Sure, jump on.

01:16.319 --> 01:17.479
All right, he's gonna need
a thoracotomy.

01:17.639 --> 01:19.199
He has no vitals -
it doesn't really make sense.

01:19.319 --> 01:20.719
All right,
let's open him up for MRB.

01:20.919 --> 01:22.199
MRB?
Maximum resident
benefit.

01:22.319 --> 01:23.239
I know what it is.

01:23.359 --> 01:24.319
Morris:
It's a good idea.

01:24.479 --> 01:25.559
Grab the interns,
assign procedures.

01:25.679 --> 01:27.279
So you're just gonna
practise on this guy.

01:27.439 --> 01:28.279
We've done enough
thoracotomies.

01:28.439 --> 01:29.479
We'll be ready
when it matters.

01:29.639 --> 01:31.119
Besides, we could
save his life.

01:31.279 --> 01:32.319
Morris:
Open up a tray, please.

01:32.479 --> 01:34.879
Central line kit and prep
for a chest tube, huh?

01:34.879 --> 01:36.078
Coming right up.

01:36.198 --> 01:37.358
OK.

01:59.318 --> 02:01.118
Maybe we did
the chart wrong.

02:01.278 --> 02:02.678
The timing
could be off.

02:02.838 --> 02:03.998
The book said
that we...

02:04.158 --> 02:06.278
Well, it was
just a month.

02:08.078 --> 02:09.958
We don't need
to do this, you know.

02:11.318 --> 02:13.198
I thought you wanted this.

02:13.318 --> 02:15.638
I mean, we have other options.

02:15.758 --> 02:17.118
There's a lot
of kids out there

02:17.278 --> 02:18.358
that need
good homes.

02:18.478 --> 02:20.838
I want to have our baby.

02:22.198 --> 02:24.238
So do I.

02:24.398 --> 02:27.718
So, what are
you saying?

02:27.838 --> 02:30.878
Nothing, just trying
to be realistic.

02:33.198 --> 02:34.238
Hmm.
Hmm.

02:34.398 --> 02:37.198
So are we crazy even
thinking about this?

02:37.278 --> 02:39.278
Probably.

02:40.358 --> 02:42.278
Why should we let
that stop us?

02:42.398 --> 02:43.478
Hmm?

02:43.638 --> 02:45.878
Stranger things
have happened, right?

02:45.958 --> 02:48.078
And you know...

02:48.078 --> 02:50.478
I so do love trying.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.038
Oh, I bet you do.

02:56.078 --> 02:56.958
Asystole.

02:57.078 --> 03:00.598
Two more litres are in.

03:00.678 --> 03:02.078
We almost done here?

03:02.198 --> 03:03.438
We're teaching, Sam.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.198
You're doing procedures
on a dead body.

03:05.358 --> 03:06.238
Yeah, well, the
interns need practice.

03:06.398 --> 03:07.358
You got a problem
with that?

03:07.478 --> 03:09.558
No, but I think there
are some living patients

03:09.678 --> 03:10.597
that could use our help.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.357
Well, feel free
to step outside.

03:13.837 --> 03:15.037
Looks like they're bringing in

03:15.197 --> 03:16.557
three more GSWs
from the shootout.

03:16.717 --> 03:18.037
Why does it
feel like

03:18.037 --> 03:19.237
we get gunshot victims
every day?

03:19.397 --> 03:20.477
Because we do.

03:20.557 --> 03:21.717
Guns don't kill people.

03:21.837 --> 03:23.397
People kill people.

03:23.557 --> 03:24.397
Hey, that's great
about Alex.

03:24.557 --> 03:25.557
I know
it's been hard.

03:25.557 --> 03:27.157
Thank you, Dawn.
What about Alex?

03:27.277 --> 03:28.437
He's coming home
today.

03:30.357 --> 03:31.437
Discharged him?

03:31.557 --> 03:32.517
When did you find out?

03:32.597 --> 03:33.637
Couple days ago.

03:33.717 --> 03:34.917
Jermaine Bennett, 17,

03:34.917 --> 03:36.317
abdominal GSW
at the left costal margin.

03:36.437 --> 03:38.197
Please! It hurts so bad!

03:38.357 --> 03:39.597
100/60,
tachy to 120.

03:39.717 --> 03:40.757
You on any medications?

03:40.917 --> 03:42.477
No!
Any allergies?

03:42.477 --> 03:43.597
No, man,
where's my brother?

03:43.757 --> 03:44.637
His little
brother Quincy -

03:44.797 --> 03:45.837
through and through
the right thigh.

03:45.957 --> 03:47.157
How you doing, Quincy?

03:47.157 --> 03:48.157
I'm all right.

03:48.277 --> 03:49.477
Pedal pulse intact.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.917
Daria, Gates,
go with Sam,

03:51.037 --> 03:52.517
Trauma Two.

03:52.677 --> 03:55.157
All right, let's start him off
on a gram of cefoxitin.

03:55.277 --> 03:56.277
We use
cefotetan now.

03:56.477 --> 03:57.957
All right, yeah, well,
that will work, too.

03:59.477 --> 04:00.437
Get off of me!

04:00.597 --> 04:01.717
Yeah, you're gonna love
this one.

04:01.877 --> 04:03.277
She shot the guy
they brought in earlier.

04:03.397 --> 04:04.397
I said don't touch me.

04:04.517 --> 04:06.557
Serena Diaz, graze wound
to the left triceps,

04:06.677 --> 04:07.597
good vitals in the field.

04:07.717 --> 04:08.837
And a real pain in the ass.

04:08.997 --> 04:10.197
Prick! please, you wish
you'd get some of this.

04:10.357 --> 04:12.037
Lot of lip on you.
Shut up, bitch!

04:12.157 --> 04:12.997
Trauma One's open.

04:13.117 --> 04:14.077
Looks pretty
superficial.

04:14.237 --> 04:15.437
Would you take
these things off me,

04:15.597 --> 04:16.837
cos it's not like
I'm going anywhere!

04:16.916 --> 04:18.156
Relax!

04:18.277 --> 04:19.437
Grady, you should take her.

04:19.557 --> 04:21.156
I cannot feel my arm!

04:21.156 --> 04:22.917
Do I have to?

04:57.676 --> 05:00.436
Anastasia Johnson,
13 years old,

05:00.436 --> 05:01.396
sickle cell disease.

05:01.596 --> 05:03.916
Has had abdominal
pain since yesterday.

05:04.076 --> 05:06.036
Any fever?
(phone ringing)

05:06.116 --> 05:07.076
No, uh, her CBC

05:07.236 --> 05:08.596
and her chest X-ray
are still pending.

05:08.796 --> 05:10.156
OK, um,
does this feel

05:10.276 --> 05:11.756
like your usual
sickle crisis pain?

05:11.756 --> 05:13.116
No, this hurts more.

05:13.116 --> 05:15.796
Start with ten IV morphine.

05:15.796 --> 05:17.076
Titrate up
from there.

05:17.236 --> 05:20.196
Isn't that kind of a big dosage
for a 13-year-old?

05:20.196 --> 05:21.516
Not for a sickler with pain.

05:21.676 --> 05:23.716
Aren't you worried
about addiction?

05:23.836 --> 05:26.716
Would you withhold morphine
from a cancer patient?

05:27.716 --> 05:28.716
Exactly.

05:28.716 --> 05:29.916
Anastasia:
You guys are going

05:29.916 --> 05:30.796
to admit me, aren't you?

05:30.876 --> 05:31.716
Not sure yet.

05:31.836 --> 05:33.356
I always get admitted.

05:33.476 --> 05:34.316
Does it hurt here?

05:34.436 --> 05:35.276
Ow!

05:35.396 --> 05:36.236
Yeah!

05:36.436 --> 05:38.556
Get a right
upper quadrant ultrasound.

05:38.556 --> 05:40.916
Do you think I'll be out
by next week?

05:41.076 --> 05:42.916
Well, you might not have
to stay.

05:43.036 --> 05:43.836
(phone ringing)

05:43.996 --> 05:45.236
But if I do,
do you think

05:45.396 --> 05:46.516
I'll be out by
next Saturday?

05:46.676 --> 05:48.396
Why?
What's next Saturday?

05:48.556 --> 05:50.716
I'm going to New York
to meet Yo-Yo Ma.

05:50.836 --> 05:52.196
The cellist?

05:52.196 --> 05:55.356
I baked cupcakes for three days
straight and sold every one.

05:55.476 --> 05:56.916
Wow.

05:57.076 --> 05:58.836
And I haven't touched
my allowance in months.

05:58.996 --> 06:00.516
Airfare's expensive.

06:00.676 --> 06:02.116
You're paying
your own way?

06:02.276 --> 06:03.676
You must be
a big fan.

06:03.756 --> 06:04.876
I'm not just a fan.

06:04.996 --> 06:05.996
It's my destiny to meet

06:06.156 --> 06:07.596
and someday perform
with the great Mr Ma.

06:07.676 --> 06:09.156
(phone beeping)

06:09.276 --> 06:10.756
Know what? I'm sorry.

06:10.916 --> 06:12.956
Uh, this is new,
and I haven't figured out

06:13.076 --> 06:14.116
how to mute it yet.

06:14.276 --> 06:15.556
Want me to fix that
for you?

06:15.676 --> 06:17.036
My dad has
the same phone.

06:17.196 --> 06:18.116
Would you?
Mm-hmm.

06:18.236 --> 06:19.555
Thank you.

06:19.555 --> 06:21.315
At your age, the chance
of conceiving

06:21.475 --> 06:23.755
on your own and carrying
a pregnancy to term

06:23.875 --> 06:26.075
is about 1% per cycle.

06:26.075 --> 06:27.915
It's not great odds.

06:29.635 --> 06:31.715
Um, what about in vitro?

06:31.715 --> 06:32.715
It's a long shot.

06:32.875 --> 06:34.235
So is 1% per cycle.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.875
(laughing) It's an
expensive long shot.

06:35.995 --> 06:37.475
But possible?

06:37.595 --> 06:39.595
How does your husband
feel about this?

06:40.635 --> 06:41.955
It's something we both want.

06:42.075 --> 06:43.355
We're in it together.

06:44.555 --> 06:47.155
All right, well...
I would need an FSH level

06:47.315 --> 06:49.195
to look at your
ovarian responsiveness,

06:49.195 --> 06:50.355
as well as an estradiol

06:50.475 --> 06:51.395
OK.

06:52.635 --> 06:54.795
Can you stop by the, uh,
outpatient lab today?

06:54.795 --> 06:57.515
I'll write up a slip.

06:57.515 --> 07:00.035
Or...if you have the time,

07:00.155 --> 07:01.515
I could do a quick blood draw

07:01.635 --> 07:03.675
right now.

07:03.795 --> 07:05.955
I'm not on for half an hour.

07:08.755 --> 07:10.235
OK, um, any chance

07:10.395 --> 07:12.315
you can just hold still
while I check you out?

07:14.955 --> 07:17.115
All right, so how did
this happen, Quincy?

07:17.235 --> 07:18.195
I don't know.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.875
The guy just
started shooting.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.875
Posterior tibial
and DP sound good.

07:23.875 --> 07:24.995
Is my brother OK?

07:26.035 --> 07:27.875
Um, let me check
on him for you.

07:27.995 --> 07:28.875
A gram of ancef

07:29.035 --> 07:30.035
and update
his tetanus.

07:30.155 --> 07:31.915
Thanks.

07:34.195 --> 07:37.035
A small amount of fluid
in the subdiaphragmatic space.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.315
Morris: Check the
spleno-renal recess.

07:38.475 --> 07:39.875
Distal neuro-vascular's intact
on the thigh wound.

07:39.955 --> 07:40.835
Vitals are stable.

07:40.955 --> 07:41.995
Get a CT angio.

07:42.115 --> 07:43.555
It's a little close
to the femoral artery.

07:43.715 --> 07:44.755
That don't even
hurt no more.

07:44.875 --> 07:46.435
That's the morphine.

07:46.555 --> 07:47.435
Taggart:
systolic's up to 120.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.355
Gates:
Well, looks like
you're not

07:49.475 --> 07:50.395
gonna need surgery, Jermaine.

07:50.555 --> 07:51.875
Where is my
brother at, man?

07:51.995 --> 07:52.995
This room over there.

07:53.155 --> 07:54.434
D-five half at
100 an hour.

07:54.514 --> 07:55.514
Yo, Quince.

07:55.714 --> 07:57.634
You all right
in there, man?
Yeah.

07:57.794 --> 07:58.994
Nothing to worry
about, little man.

07:58.994 --> 08:00.194
You just chill out, OK?

08:00.314 --> 08:01.514
All right.

08:01.634 --> 08:02.914
Officer Hollis:
He wouldn't be here

08:03.074 --> 08:04.634
if you didn't have him out
selling drugs.

08:04.794 --> 08:05.754
Did I ask you?

08:05.954 --> 08:07.274
Daria:
Good breath sounds
bilaterally.

08:07.394 --> 08:08.234
Sam, how's
the hemocue?

08:08.354 --> 08:09.834
I'm doing it right now.

08:09.954 --> 08:12.434
You know, you could
have told me about Alex.

08:12.594 --> 08:13.794
I was worried -
you know that.

08:13.914 --> 08:15.274
How would I know that?

08:16.754 --> 08:18.514
Hemocue's 13.2.

08:18.674 --> 08:20.434
OK, set up the rapid
infuser to be safe.

08:20.594 --> 08:21.834
Taggart: Ours is out
being serviced.

08:22.034 --> 08:23.714
I'll go grab it
from the OR.
You know what?

08:23.874 --> 08:25.554
We need to uncuff him - we got
to get some work done here.

08:25.554 --> 08:26.914
That really necessary?

08:27.954 --> 08:29.514
Yeah, it's really necessary.

08:30.754 --> 08:33.313
We should have results
by the end of the day.

08:33.433 --> 08:34.433
That soon?

08:34.594 --> 08:36.354
I have friends
in the lab.

08:36.514 --> 08:38.433
Janet, I...
thank you.

08:38.514 --> 08:39.514
Don't thank me yet.

08:39.594 --> 08:40.714
We'll talk later.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.313
Excuse me.

08:42.474 --> 08:43.634
Taggart:
Oh, hold that.

08:49.274 --> 08:50.474
Oh, hi, Dr Banfield.

08:50.594 --> 08:51.714
Sam.

08:51.834 --> 08:53.074
Got three GSWs.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.154
Drug deal gone bad.

08:54.314 --> 08:56.194
Just in time
to start my shift.

08:56.314 --> 08:57.794
(chuckling)

08:57.954 --> 09:00.034
Oh, how is your,
uh, boy doing?

09:00.114 --> 09:01.154
He's better.

09:01.234 --> 09:02.114
Thanks.

09:02.234 --> 09:03.274
He's coming home today.

09:03.394 --> 09:04.474
You must be relieved.

09:04.474 --> 09:05.434
Yeah.

09:05.554 --> 09:06.914
You can say that again.

09:10.314 --> 09:12.754
(grunts quietly)
I just gave blood.

09:15.874 --> 09:17.554
Get off of me.
I need to examine you.

09:17.714 --> 09:19.314
You're not gonna examine
nothing - get off of me!

09:19.514 --> 09:21.634
Lady, come on now.
Nobody touches me,
you hear me?

09:21.794 --> 09:24.434
Hey, Jermaine, you and your
stupid-ass little brother

09:24.434 --> 09:25.634
better come up with five grand
or you're dead!

09:25.754 --> 09:26.874
Ma'am, please.

09:26.994 --> 09:28.593
Get the hell away from me.

09:32.593 --> 09:33.673
Rasgotra:
No rebound or guarding.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.233
Gates:
All right, repeat
CBC in an hour.

09:35.353 --> 09:36.193
Dr Morris,

09:36.313 --> 09:38.353
may I please join you?

09:38.513 --> 09:40.193
Why, you can't handle
your patient?

09:40.313 --> 09:41.793
She's...a lot.

09:41.913 --> 09:42.993
One crazy bitch

09:43.073 --> 09:44.193
is what she is.

09:44.313 --> 09:45.153
Fine, go clear
some patients.

09:45.353 --> 09:46.593
Infuser's primed
if you need it.

09:46.713 --> 09:48.073
This one going to the OR?

09:48.233 --> 09:49.033
Maybe.
No.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.793
Uh, Dr Rasgotra?

09:50.953 --> 09:52.953
Probably doesn't
need an ex lap,

09:52.953 --> 09:54.993
but we'll wait
on the belly CT.
Who's next door?

09:55.153 --> 09:56.513
Little brother.

09:56.633 --> 09:57.633
Stable lower
extremity wound.

09:57.633 --> 09:59.273
But we have to rule out
vascular injury.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.833
Daria:
Um, do you want me

10:00.993 --> 10:02.393
to present the findings?
I-I got it.

10:02.513 --> 10:03.473
What's his name?

10:03.553 --> 10:04.993
Quincy.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.713
Hi, Quincy.

10:07.833 --> 10:08.833
How are you doing?

10:08.953 --> 10:09.953
Fine.

10:10.153 --> 10:11.913
Any pain
in this leg?
No.

10:12.993 --> 10:14.553
Quincy, we need
to call your parents.

10:14.673 --> 10:16.793
Do you know how we
can reach them?

10:16.953 --> 10:18.233
Are they at home?

10:18.353 --> 10:19.353
At work?

10:19.433 --> 10:20.913
Is Jermaine all right?

10:21.073 --> 10:24.393
Well, we're working hard
to make sure that he is.

10:24.553 --> 10:27.033
Look, honey, I know it's really
scary, but it's important.

10:27.193 --> 10:28.993
Do you know how we
can find your parents?

10:28.993 --> 10:30.073
They're dead.

10:30.193 --> 10:31.553
They're both dead.

10:34.153 --> 10:36.233
I'll be right back.

10:39.273 --> 10:40.433
Pressure's down
to 60 systolic.

10:40.553 --> 10:42.793
Tachin' away at 120.
Two units on the infuser.

10:42.913 --> 10:44.673
Sonosite again. He may have
opened up his spleen.

10:44.873 --> 10:46.393
Daria:
CT can take him.
You seeing more blood?

10:46.473 --> 10:47.393
Can't tell.

10:47.553 --> 10:48.593
Taggart:
Bradying down.

10:48.753 --> 10:51.113
Daria:
Oh, I'll get the crash cart.

10:51.273 --> 10:53.113
You missed the decreased
breath sounds on left.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.393
Bullet went through
the chest, not the abdomen.

10:55.513 --> 10:57.953
Tracheal shift
and elevated neck veins.

10:58.073 --> 10:59.033
Tension pneumo.

11:02.992 --> 11:04.152
Heart rate's coming up.

11:05.352 --> 11:06.472
So's the BP.

11:06.472 --> 11:09.752
Open up a chest tube tray,
32 French.

11:09.912 --> 11:11.312
You want
some help with that?

11:11.392 --> 11:12.752
I think I can handle it.

11:12.872 --> 11:15.312
(Jermaine groaning)

11:15.472 --> 11:16.912
Man, get that off me.
Man, what you doing?!

11:17.032 --> 11:18.112
Some pressure here.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.112
(screams)
Got your oh-silk.

11:21.232 --> 11:22.912
Trachea's midline.

11:23.112 --> 11:25.312
Good breath sounds
on the left.

11:25.432 --> 11:26.992
Where'd Quincy go?

11:27.152 --> 11:29.072
He's getting an X-ray to make
sure his leg's OK.

11:29.192 --> 11:30.192
Sats are up to 98.

11:30.312 --> 11:32.752
Oh, man,
I can't believe this!

11:32.752 --> 11:34.592
What, that you got shot
doing a drug deal?

11:34.592 --> 11:36.832
Occupational hazard.

11:36.992 --> 11:39.832
All right, keep him
at five litres.

11:39.952 --> 11:41.032
Ready for dressing.

11:41.232 --> 11:42.872
We're out of xeroform.
I'll be right back.

11:44.352 --> 11:45.432
Is this Jermaine Bennett?

11:45.512 --> 11:46.752
I'm Dr Banfield.

11:46.912 --> 11:48.392
Detective Reitz.

11:48.552 --> 11:49.832
I need to ask him
a few questions.

11:49.992 --> 11:51.592
I ain't got
no answers for you.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.752
Oh, is that right?

11:52.912 --> 11:55.472
Probably not a good call,
Jermaine.

11:56.992 --> 11:59.432
OK, I guess I'll see
you at the arraignment.

11:59.632 --> 12:00.832
How soon till
we can move him?

12:00.952 --> 12:02.232
He still has to do a CT

12:02.392 --> 12:03.832
and he may need surgery -
I'll let you know.

12:03.952 --> 12:05.592
OK. Hey.

12:05.752 --> 12:07.352
Have yourself a good day,
Jermaine.

12:07.512 --> 12:08.992
Elastoplast
and bandage scissors.

12:09.112 --> 12:11.632
And Dr Gates, you should go.
You were off an hour ago.

12:11.752 --> 12:12.672
Oh, thank you.

12:12.752 --> 12:14.872
Another ABG in 20, please.

12:14.872 --> 12:16.552
I'm going to be right back,
Dr Banfield.

12:16.552 --> 12:18.032
Uh, hey, Tony.
Huh?

12:18.192 --> 12:19.992
Tony, is everything all right?
Yeah, why?

12:20.192 --> 12:21.472
I don't know,
I was just...

12:21.472 --> 12:22.992
just wondering.
I'm fine.

12:24.672 --> 12:27.872
So, uh, is this how it's
going to be from now on?

12:28.072 --> 12:29.952
What?
You and me, is this how
it's going to be?

12:30.112 --> 12:31.992
Tony, I really
don't want to have

12:32.112 --> 12:33.592
this conversation
right now, please.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.832
Sam, I apologize.

12:35.952 --> 12:37.631
I take full responsibility.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.871
You taking
responsibility now

12:39.991 --> 12:41.391
doesn't change anything.

12:41.591 --> 12:43.871
You put my kid in the ICU.
All right, so how long
are you planning

12:44.031 --> 12:45.831
on being pissed off at me?
You know, I don't know.

12:45.831 --> 12:48.151
OK?
This is not easy for me.

12:48.271 --> 12:49.151
All right, fine.
I just shouldn't have

12:49.311 --> 12:50.551
to put up with this
while I'm working.

12:50.551 --> 12:51.831
You see, that's your problem.
What?

12:51.951 --> 12:53.431
How is any of this about you?

12:53.631 --> 12:55.351
You giving me crap,
that makes it about me.

12:55.511 --> 12:56.991
You know, you have no idea
what I've been going through...

12:57.151 --> 12:58.591
That's because you
don't tell me, Sam.
..the past few weeks.

12:58.751 --> 13:00.471
Why would I tell you?
You don't listen!
What is that

13:00.631 --> 13:02.031
supposed to mean?
Never mind.

13:02.191 --> 13:04.551
I am not going
to do this right now.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.631
OK? Please?

13:05.711 --> 13:07.151
Please.

13:07.311 --> 13:09.071
All right, Sam.

13:09.231 --> 13:11.351
It doesn't
have to be like this.

13:11.471 --> 13:13.791
Look, what happened
was horrible.

13:15.391 --> 13:17.471
But Sarah and Alex
are going to be OK.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.511
A girl died, Tony.

13:20.511 --> 13:22.911
And my kid came
pretty close.

13:24.351 --> 13:26.431
That is not OK.

13:28.311 --> 13:29.911
You know what?

13:29.911 --> 13:31.751
You do you...

13:31.871 --> 13:33.471
and I'll do me.

13:33.591 --> 13:35.711
And we'll just go
our separate ways, OK?

15:11.990 --> 15:13.430
- # Ooh-ooh!
- # Fun, fun, fun,

15:13.550 --> 15:15.550
# Now that daddy
took the T-Bird away

15:15.630 --> 15:17.350
# Ooh, fun, fun!

17:22.548 --> 17:23.867
Right now
at Sainsbury's,

17:23.988 --> 17:25.188
you can save
a third

17:25.308 --> 17:27.147
on all these
skincare products,

17:28.028 --> 17:29.948
just in time
for Mother's Day!

18:51.708 --> 18:53.188
There's risk
of a neuro-vascular injury.

18:53.308 --> 18:54.708
She's very intimidating.

18:54.868 --> 18:56.868
Well, you've got
to learn how to deal
with a difficult patient.

18:57.028 --> 18:58.507
She threatened
to kill me, Dr Morris.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.707
My family, my friends,
my dog, too.

19:00.787 --> 19:02.027
I don't even have a dog.

19:02.147 --> 19:03.147
How has she been?

19:03.307 --> 19:05.227
Pretty quiet.
For a change.

19:05.227 --> 19:08.267
All right, kid,
watch and learn.

19:09.987 --> 19:12.267
Ma'am, we need to examine you.

19:12.267 --> 19:13.107
You're not touching me.

19:13.267 --> 19:15.067
You could have an injury
to a blood vessel,

19:15.187 --> 19:16.187
a nerve in your arm...
So?

19:16.307 --> 19:17.827
So we need to give you
full examination.

19:17.947 --> 19:19.267
You touch me without consent,

19:19.387 --> 19:21.507
after I beat your ass,
I'm-a sue you for assault.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.067
Listen, ma'am...
Damn it!

19:23.067 --> 19:25.107
No! What, I got to spell it out
for you jerk-offs?

19:25.227 --> 19:26.427
Go away!

19:31.867 --> 19:33.747
I am totally learning.

19:44.507 --> 19:45.387
Hey, Tony!

19:45.467 --> 19:47.427
Hey!

19:49.787 --> 19:50.827
I thought maybe you
weren't coming.

19:50.987 --> 19:52.467
Oh, no, sorry -
I got stuck at work.

19:52.587 --> 19:54.427
How are the new digs?
Oh, it's kind of a dump.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.307
Beats the hell out of sleeping
in the park, though.

19:56.427 --> 19:58.027
(chuckles)

19:59.107 --> 20:00.387
"Johns Hopkins"?

20:00.507 --> 20:01.547
You leaving us?
Frank.

20:01.667 --> 20:02.507
This is my turf.

20:02.587 --> 20:03.867
I don't come up to the OR

20:04.027 --> 20:05.307
messing around
with your stuff.

20:05.507 --> 20:06.867
Tracy:
Are you going
to Johns Hopkins?

20:07.027 --> 20:08.627
No. I'm just looking
at a programme.

20:08.827 --> 20:10.347
Johns Hopkins?
Who's going to Johns Hopkins?

20:10.507 --> 20:12.507
Dr Rasgotra.
I'm just looking.

20:12.627 --> 20:13.707
"Paediatric surgery"?

20:13.867 --> 20:15.307
Yeah, I'm thinking about
sub-specialties.

20:15.467 --> 20:17.227
Oh, you should talk
to Dr Banfield.

20:17.227 --> 20:19.067
I'd rather not.
She went to med school there.

20:19.227 --> 20:21.147
Ultrasound results
for Anastasia Johnson.

20:22.827 --> 20:24.307
Oh, gallstones
with wall thickening

20:24.387 --> 20:25.667
and pericholecystic fluid.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.507
Cholecystitis,
I'll talk to her.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.067
Apparently,
he jumped the divider.

20:30.227 --> 20:31.587
Hit them head on.
(groans)

20:31.747 --> 20:34.186
Dr Banfield,
Dr Coburn called
for you earlier.

20:34.306 --> 20:35.466
How much earlier?

20:35.546 --> 20:37.426
Ah, maybe 20 minutes.

20:37.586 --> 20:38.866
Their parents,
driver of the other car,

20:38.986 --> 20:40.546
killed instantly.
Oh, God...

20:40.746 --> 20:43.346
So for the last two years,
Jermaine's been in a group home

20:43.346 --> 20:46.506
and Quincy has been
in one, two, three, four

20:46.626 --> 20:47.986
different foster homes.

20:48.186 --> 20:49.386
Apparently he keeps
running away,

20:49.546 --> 20:51.826
travels halfway across the city
just to see his brother.

20:51.826 --> 20:53.426
Mm, so what now?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.826
Jermaine's
in police custody

20:55.906 --> 20:57.186
and Quincy's foster mom told me

20:57.306 --> 20:58.906
to give him bus fare,
send him home.

20:59.066 --> 21:00.426
What?
She's got three kids

21:00.586 --> 21:01.986
of her own
and a full-time job.

21:02.146 --> 21:04.626
I'm going to go
find him a ride.

21:04.706 --> 21:06.146
Keep me posted on his brother.

21:06.146 --> 21:07.946
All right.

21:09.186 --> 21:10.586
Uh, Dr Banfield,
I need you to sign off

21:10.746 --> 21:12.546
on my Bell's palsy.
OK.

21:16.386 --> 21:18.266
And my broken ankle lady.

21:26.466 --> 21:28.506
Dr Martin, will there
be anything else?

21:33.426 --> 21:36.746
Yes, yes, uh... Yes, Dr Coburn.
Cate Banfield.

21:38.226 --> 21:40.226
Oh, uh, yes, of course.

21:40.386 --> 21:44.586
Um, the PID patient
got cefoxitin and doxycycline.

21:44.666 --> 21:46.546
We sent her up to the GYN floor.

21:47.986 --> 21:49.906
Mm-hmm.

21:51.346 --> 21:53.226
Yeah. Anything else?

21:54.226 --> 21:55.786
Yeah, I understand.

21:55.946 --> 21:59.066
No. No hurry at all.

22:03.866 --> 22:05.866
Hi. How are you feeling?

22:05.986 --> 22:07.466
Much better, thanks.

22:07.626 --> 22:08.745
Can I get you anything?

22:08.905 --> 22:10.385
You're admitting me,
aren't you?

22:10.545 --> 22:12.345
Yes, you have an infection
in your gall bladder

22:12.505 --> 22:14.225
and you'll need IV
antibiotics for a while.

22:14.345 --> 22:15.505
I knew it.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.185
I'm sorry about New York.

22:17.305 --> 22:19.545
I'll catch him
in San Francisco.

22:19.545 --> 22:22.145
Going to need some
new cupcake recipes.

22:22.305 --> 22:23.945
Oh, and I fixed
your phone.

22:24.025 --> 22:25.185
Oh, thank you.

22:25.185 --> 22:27.105
I downloaded some ringtones,
a couple games,

22:27.225 --> 22:28.985
and also this cool
koi pond thing.

22:28.985 --> 22:30.025
Koi pond. Great.

22:30.185 --> 22:33.225
Oh, and you got a text
from somebody named Ray.

22:33.225 --> 22:35.665
And, girl, he is cute.
Wait, what?

22:35.665 --> 22:37.265
I had him send
a picture.

22:37.465 --> 22:38.625
Don't worry,
I told him it was

22:38.785 --> 22:40.265
for whenever he called,
it would show up.

22:40.385 --> 22:42.425
I'm sorry.

22:42.425 --> 22:44.465
I hope you're not mad.
I couldn't resist.

22:44.585 --> 22:47.345
What exactly did you text him?

22:47.465 --> 22:50.025
I told him...

22:50.185 --> 22:52.225
I mean, you were thinking
about him, too.

22:52.385 --> 22:54.985
He said he was
thinking about me?

22:56.425 --> 22:57.785
Well, look at you!

22:57.905 --> 22:59.465
You clean up nice, man.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.305
Suit's a little big,

23:01.385 --> 23:03.345
but, uh, it looks good.

23:03.345 --> 23:05.065
Looks like I'm getting
married or something.

23:05.185 --> 23:06.585
Well, let's get
you a job first,

23:06.785 --> 23:07.825
then we'll get
you a girl, huh?

23:07.985 --> 23:09.945
Dude in my squad used to carry
around a picture

23:10.105 --> 23:11.785
of him and his wife
on their wedding day.

23:11.945 --> 23:14.185
He was wearing a suit
just like this.

23:14.345 --> 23:16.265
19 years old and married,
you believe that?

23:16.385 --> 23:17.945
Carson.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.545
Let's see...
Teddy Carson.

23:20.705 --> 23:22.185
He used to brag
about how he waited

23:22.345 --> 23:23.785
to have sex
until they got married.

23:23.905 --> 23:26.825
High school sweethearts,
the whole nine, you know?

23:26.945 --> 23:29.305
But he actually waited.

23:29.465 --> 23:31.585
Guys used to clown
on him about that.

23:31.665 --> 23:32.945
(wheezing laughter)

23:32.945 --> 23:35.425
Especially Montoya.

23:35.505 --> 23:37.425
God...

23:38.545 --> 23:40.625
God...

23:40.785 --> 23:43.304
Used to carry that picture
everywhere.

23:47.664 --> 23:50.144
BP 122/77,
pulse 90,

23:50.264 --> 23:51.544
satting at 98.

23:51.664 --> 23:52.704
Hey, what's,
what's all that mean?

23:52.784 --> 23:54.104
You're stable.

23:54.264 --> 23:56.704
CT's negative
for bleeding in the belly.

23:56.864 --> 23:59.064
Really? I thought it was an
abdominal entrance wound.

23:59.224 --> 24:01.384
When he was shot, he must've
been taking a breath in.

24:01.544 --> 24:03.304
Only damage
to the chest and lungs.

24:03.424 --> 24:05.464
How long y'all keep
this old garden hose in me?

24:05.544 --> 24:06.984
Two, maybe three days.

24:07.104 --> 24:08.384
(clicks tongue)

24:08.464 --> 24:09.584
Man.

24:09.784 --> 24:11.224
Man, when they bringing
Quincy back?

24:11.344 --> 24:12.704
Oh, he's back.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.264
He's... Can I see him?

24:14.424 --> 24:16.304
I don't think they let minors
visit inmates.

24:16.464 --> 24:17.504
But don't worry, you're
teaching him young.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.864
You two might get
to share a cell someday.

24:20.024 --> 24:21.544
It's not like that.
He's a good kid.

24:21.704 --> 24:24.104
Looks to me like
he takes after his big brother.

24:24.224 --> 24:26.184
He ain't nothing like me.

24:26.304 --> 24:28.024
Except for today.

24:29.224 --> 24:31.144
Look, I do what I do

24:31.304 --> 24:32.744
so he don't have to,
all right?

24:32.904 --> 24:34.944
Well, you could get
a real job, you know.

24:35.104 --> 24:36.784
Oh, a real job?
Mm-hmm.

24:36.864 --> 24:37.824
(chuckles)

24:37.984 --> 24:39.144
What, flipping burgers?

24:39.264 --> 24:40.904
Huh? Bussing tables?

24:40.984 --> 24:42.064
Why not?

24:42.184 --> 24:43.664
Could you make it on that?

24:46.784 --> 24:48.584
I'm saving up for a nice place

24:48.744 --> 24:49.944
in a nice
neighbourhood.

24:50.104 --> 24:51.664
I'm gonna turn 18,
file for custody,

24:51.824 --> 24:53.544
and make sure he go
to a good school.

24:53.624 --> 24:55.464
Custody? Not in prison.

24:55.624 --> 24:57.584
And when you get out,
he'll be grown.

24:57.744 --> 24:59.184
You want to do
what's best for him?

24:59.304 --> 25:02.624
Co-operate with the police
and keep your ass out of jail.

25:02.624 --> 25:03.944
Cooperate?!
Man, you must be crazy.

25:04.104 --> 25:05.984
You know what would happen to me
if I snitch?

25:06.104 --> 25:07.984
Oh, you going to give
it another try?

25:08.104 --> 25:09.584
Part of the job, boys.

25:09.664 --> 25:11.624
Be our guest.

25:13.584 --> 25:15.184
Oh, my God, not again!

25:15.344 --> 25:17.584
You need an exam.
I got rights.

25:17.704 --> 25:19.503
Well, technically, you're
in police custody, OK?

25:19.783 --> 25:21.463
So either consent
to an exam or I get

25:21.623 --> 25:23.783
ten cops in here
and make you consent.

25:24.463 --> 25:25.863
Come on.

25:26.023 --> 25:27.583
You could have
long-term damage.

25:35.783 --> 25:36.903
Look down my shirt.

25:36.983 --> 25:38.143
I'm sorry?

25:38.263 --> 25:40.583
Underneath my bra, look.

25:40.743 --> 25:42.063
Look.

25:47.743 --> 25:48.943
I'm a cop.

27:14.382 --> 27:16.382
# Here come the girls!

27:16.382 --> 27:18.582
Like mother, like daughter.

27:18.582 --> 27:19.782
What makes you feel great,

27:19.782 --> 27:21.062
makes her feel great.

27:21.062 --> 27:23.862
That's why we're offering up
to a third off

27:23.862 --> 27:25.822
beautiful Mother's Day
gifts at Boots

28:00.982 --> 28:02.422
- # Ooh-ooh!
- # Fun, fun, fun,

28:02.542 --> 28:04.542
# Now that daddy
took the T-Bird away

28:04.622 --> 28:06.342
# Ooh, fun, fun!

28:31.781 --> 28:32.901
It's spring.

28:33.821 --> 28:35.781
The days are getting longer

28:35.861 --> 28:38.061
and the weather's getting warmer.

28:39.021 --> 28:41.061
How many more excuses do you need

28:41.141 --> 28:42.941
to treat yourself to a new wardrobe?

28:43.781 --> 28:45.301
Oh! There's one.

28:47.061 --> 28:48.061
..at Tesco.

28:50.981 --> 28:53.061
- Mr Peters, how are you?
- Very well, thank you. How are you?

28:53.181 --> 28:55.781
- Very well. Good to see you.
- Thank you very much.

28:55.861 --> 28:57.861
Um... How many more?

28:57.941 --> 29:01.101
61,176, Happy.

29:01.221 --> 29:03.021
- But three couldn't make it, so...
- Such a shame.

29:03.141 --> 29:05.261
Last year, thousands came back
to Norwich Union.

29:05.341 --> 29:06.381
And with savings of

29:06.461 --> 29:07.781
up to Â£140 on car insurance,

29:07.901 --> 29:09.021
this year
there may be more.

29:09.141 --> 29:10.941
Get a
happy quote.

29:10.941 --> 29:12.581
ACOUSTIC GUITAR

29:14.901 --> 29:17.381
At Halifax we understand
that right now

29:17.461 --> 29:18.821
every penny counts.

29:20.381 --> 29:23.861
So whether you're buying a home
or looking to remortgage

29:23.941 --> 29:26.221
we could help you save money.

29:27.381 --> 29:29.621
A little extra help from Halifax.

31:03.420 --> 31:05.300
Good cap refill.

31:05.540 --> 31:08.340
That means you didn't injure
any blood vessels.
OK.

31:08.540 --> 31:10.380
You feel that here?
Mm-hmm.

31:10.540 --> 31:12.180
How about here?
Mm-hmm.

31:12.340 --> 31:14.340
OK, squeeze
my fingers.

31:17.820 --> 31:19.460
You know, they should
come in and uncuff you.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.940
This is Chicago, sweetie.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.420
You can't trust anyone,
especially the cops.

31:23.420 --> 31:25.220
They don't know
about you?

31:25.340 --> 31:27.540
It's a narcotics assignment.

31:27.700 --> 31:29.460
Just my supervisor,
his supervisor

31:29.580 --> 31:30.820
and the Chief of Police know.

31:30.940 --> 31:32.740
And, well, now you know.

31:32.860 --> 31:34.620
Oh.

31:34.780 --> 31:37.579
OK, bend your wrist
back for me.

31:37.739 --> 31:39.579
Now push against
my hand.

31:41.579 --> 31:44.779
So... So you're, like,
in deep cover?

31:44.939 --> 31:46.059
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

31:46.219 --> 31:47.259
How long you
been under?

31:47.379 --> 31:48.939
5 months, 23 days.

31:48.939 --> 31:51.259
Wow.

31:51.259 --> 31:53.059
What?

31:53.179 --> 31:55.019
Nothing. Nothing.

31:55.099 --> 31:56.899
OK, let's, uh,

31:57.059 --> 31:59.259
let's see how strong
you are here.

31:59.419 --> 32:01.179
OK.
All right.

32:01.299 --> 32:02.339
There you go.
(grunts)

32:04.339 --> 32:06.339
(groans) Hm!

32:08.379 --> 32:10.899
How are those kids
I came in with?

32:11.059 --> 32:13.539
Uh, both OK.
For now.

32:13.659 --> 32:14.979
Jermaine pisses me off.

32:15.139 --> 32:16.219
He's smart,
he could be something.

32:16.379 --> 32:18.819
I just can't find a way
to get him out of this life

32:18.979 --> 32:21.779
without blowing my cover.

32:21.899 --> 32:23.699
You know, those kids -

32:23.859 --> 32:26.779
you can't blame yourself
for that.

32:32.579 --> 32:34.499
He came out of nowhere.

32:36.499 --> 32:37.979
Me and Jermaine,
we're doing this deal.

32:38.139 --> 32:40.379
All of a sudden,
a guy pulls a gun on us.

32:40.539 --> 32:41.659
Next thing I know

32:41.819 --> 32:43.619
Jermaine's little brother
is running up, screaming -

32:43.739 --> 32:46.859
and this son of bitch,
he shoots at him.

32:50.859 --> 32:52.819
I hit him three times
right in the chest,

32:52.979 --> 32:55.379
and I don't even remember
grabbing my gun.

32:57.419 --> 32:59.899
That was the kid
they brought in this morning.

33:03.779 --> 33:06.099
Hey, you know, you did...
you did what you had to do.

33:06.299 --> 33:08.019
You know, things I've seen
doing this job,

33:08.099 --> 33:09.899
you wouldn't believe it.

33:10.059 --> 33:11.898
But who shoots a little kid?

33:12.018 --> 33:14.138
All for a backpack full of blow.

33:17.218 --> 33:19.138
Must be hard.

33:21.018 --> 33:23.978
Always... Always pretending
to be somebody else.

33:24.138 --> 33:27.658
Hey, you got a career
out in Hollywood

33:27.778 --> 33:29.578
if this whole narc thing
doesn't work out.

33:29.658 --> 33:31.298
(laughs)

33:34.698 --> 33:36.538
My real name is Claudia.

33:37.538 --> 33:39.898
Archie.

33:42.378 --> 33:44.058
Mm-mm.

33:44.178 --> 33:46.338
No pericardial effusion.

33:46.498 --> 33:48.218
Any pain
in your belly?

33:48.378 --> 33:50.018
No, it's just my chest.

33:50.138 --> 33:51.978
Try a mig of dilaudid.

33:57.218 --> 33:58.978
Your brother's CT
is negative

33:59.138 --> 34:00.938
for any internal damage
to his leg.

34:01.098 --> 34:03.058
I think he's going
to be fine.

34:03.058 --> 34:04.858
(sighing with relief)
Thank you.

34:05.058 --> 34:07.618
(sighs)
Oh, man.

34:07.738 --> 34:10.658
Little dude was so scared -
all that blood, you know?

34:10.818 --> 34:13.618
I just hate
to see him scared.

34:13.777 --> 34:16.098
I tell him
all the time, he...

34:16.257 --> 34:19.058
he can be brave,
not scared.

34:19.217 --> 34:21.018
You know?

34:21.018 --> 34:22.458
Heart rate's up.
IV infiltrated.

34:22.618 --> 34:23.618
He hasn't been
getting fluids.

34:23.777 --> 34:24.818
All right, what about
the other side?

34:24.818 --> 34:25.697
Antecubital blew.

34:25.818 --> 34:26.858
OK, I'll do
a subclavian.

34:26.978 --> 34:28.978
What's happening to me?

34:29.138 --> 34:30.058
What's happening?
What's happening?

34:30.217 --> 34:32.138
All right,
I need to put an IV

34:32.297 --> 34:33.498
in the vein
under your collarbone.

34:33.658 --> 34:36.138
(moans)
A little burning
here, Jermaine.

34:36.138 --> 34:37.018
Introducer needle.

34:37.178 --> 34:38.858
(grunting)
Am I going to be all right?

34:38.978 --> 34:40.578
Huh?
Keep still.

34:40.697 --> 34:43.297
BP's 110/70.

34:43.418 --> 34:44.818
Another two
of morphine.

34:44.898 --> 34:46.456
Hi, you must be Mom.

34:46.577 --> 34:47.617
I'm Dr Rasgotra.

34:47.737 --> 34:48.617
Sheila Johnson.

34:48.737 --> 34:49.857
Hi. How you feeling, Ana?

34:49.976 --> 34:51.536
Not too bad.

34:51.536 --> 34:54.137
Except tickets to San Francisco
are 600 bucks.

34:55.137 --> 34:57.217
So, she has an infection

34:57.377 --> 34:58.617
in her gall bladder

34:58.737 --> 35:00.537
and we're admitting her
to the surgical service.

35:00.657 --> 35:01.657
She needs surgery?

35:01.777 --> 35:02.777
We'll treat
with antibiotics

35:02.857 --> 35:03.817
for a few days

35:03.977 --> 35:05.097
until the infection
cools off,

35:05.257 --> 35:07.497
and then we'll remove
her gall bladder.

35:07.617 --> 35:09.457
I'm so sorry, baby.

35:09.577 --> 35:11.337
I hate this.

35:11.497 --> 35:12.977
I miss everything.

35:13.097 --> 35:14.377
What do we always say?

35:14.537 --> 35:17.337
Strongest trees in the forest.

35:17.457 --> 35:18.337
That's right.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.457
The strongest trees

35:19.617 --> 35:22.737
in the forest can withstand
the strongest winds.

35:22.897 --> 35:24.497
It's one of her
grandmother's sayings.

35:24.497 --> 35:26.817
She's got, like, a thousand.

35:26.897 --> 35:28.337
It's nice. I like it.

35:28.457 --> 35:30.057
So, Mrs Johnson,

35:30.217 --> 35:31.857
if you'd like to sign
the admission forms now,

35:31.937 --> 35:32.857
Dawn can take you.

35:32.977 --> 35:34.457
Sure thing. Right this way.

35:34.577 --> 35:36.457
I'll be back in a flash.

35:39.457 --> 35:42.177
So, do you have
any questions?

35:42.337 --> 35:43.657
Yeah.

35:43.817 --> 35:45.577
Why did I have to
get sickle cell?

35:45.657 --> 35:46.577
I'm sorry.

35:46.697 --> 35:48.377
I just want to see Yo-Yo Ma -

35:48.497 --> 35:49.817
is that asking too much?

35:49.937 --> 35:51.737
No. It's not.

35:51.857 --> 35:54.257
He's playing Mozart's
cello sonatas.

35:54.417 --> 35:56.537
Mozart barely wrote anything
for the cello.

35:56.657 --> 35:57.617
All my friends

35:57.737 --> 35:59.097
go see the dumb
Jonas brothers

35:59.257 --> 36:01.057
and I can't catch
a break?

36:01.177 --> 36:03.057
You know, you have every right
to be upset.

36:03.137 --> 36:05.017
I'd be upset, too.

36:05.177 --> 36:07.577
I wish there was
something I could do.

36:07.737 --> 36:08.977
Hmph! Give me a
new gall bladder

36:09.137 --> 36:10.617
and get me the heck
out of here.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.617
I put some more stuff
on your phone.

36:13.697 --> 36:14.697
Thanks.

36:14.697 --> 36:16.937
And you got another text.

36:17.057 --> 36:18.217
From Ray?

36:18.377 --> 36:19.937
From some other guy
named Simon Brenner.

36:20.057 --> 36:21.856
From Australia.

36:21.936 --> 36:23.976
And, girl, he's cute, too!

36:24.136 --> 36:26.976
Uh, I thought we agreed
no more texts.

36:27.056 --> 36:28.856
We agreed no more texts to Ray.

36:28.856 --> 36:30.456
So,

36:30.656 --> 36:32.776
does he have
an accent?

36:32.856 --> 36:34.256
I knew it.

36:34.416 --> 36:36.376
I love

36:36.496 --> 36:37.456
accents.

36:37.456 --> 36:39.456
You're a total player, huh?

36:42.296 --> 36:44.256
Catheter's in.
OK. Go.

36:45.776 --> 36:48.216
How's the chest
tube output?

36:48.336 --> 36:50.896
Less than a hundred.

36:51.056 --> 36:53.936
All right, I think we just
got behind on the fluids.

36:54.016 --> 36:55.696
Heart rate's down to 90.

36:55.776 --> 36:57.536
Pressure's up to 112/78.

36:57.656 --> 37:00.296
Put a dressing on this.

37:00.776 --> 37:03.256
Uh, repeat CBC and chest.

37:04.136 --> 37:06.136
(MUMBLING) What happened?

37:06.136 --> 37:07.696
What are...what are
you guys doing?

37:07.696 --> 37:10.136
You were sick

37:10.136 --> 37:12.056
because you weren't
getting enough fluids.

37:12.056 --> 37:13.736
We filled up your tank
with two litres.

37:15.496 --> 37:16.736
Detective!

37:16.736 --> 37:18.656
Yeah, how can I
help you, doc?

37:18.656 --> 37:20.696
Jermaine Bennett...

37:20.696 --> 37:22.456
you should try talking
to him again.

37:22.456 --> 37:23.936
I got a feeling
about him.

37:23.936 --> 37:24.576
A feeling?

37:24.576 --> 37:26.136
Yeah.

37:26.136 --> 37:27.216
You mind elaborating?

37:27.216 --> 37:29.736
I see a lot of knucklehead
kids come through here.

37:29.736 --> 37:31.536
He's, uh, he's different.

37:31.536 --> 37:34.136
No, he's pretty clear,
he's got nothing to say.

37:34.136 --> 37:36.856
Uh, just talk to him again.
Waste of time.

37:36.856 --> 37:38.336
Just, just try.

37:38.336 --> 37:40.616
Dr Coburn!

37:40.616 --> 37:42.016
Cate, hi.

37:42.016 --> 37:44.136
Glad I caught you.
Yeah...

37:44.136 --> 37:45.976
We should really talk tomorrow.

37:45.976 --> 37:47.616
I have got an appointment
downtown.

37:47.616 --> 37:50.416
I got to be back
in one hour.
Janet, please.

37:50.416 --> 37:51.056
OK.

37:53.696 --> 37:55.056
Uh... all right.

37:55.056 --> 37:56.936
Your labs, they show

37:56.936 --> 37:59.375
that your estradiol
and prolactin are fine.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.695
Mm-hmm.
But your FSH is 13.5.

38:01.695 --> 38:04.095
It means your ovaries
aren't...

38:04.095 --> 38:05.815
Yeah, I know what it means.

38:05.815 --> 38:07.495
Yeah, so the chances of IVF
being successful are...

38:07.495 --> 38:08.855
No, not good.

38:08.855 --> 38:10.775
With your own egg,

38:10.775 --> 38:12.575
the chances are
approaching zero.

38:12.575 --> 38:13.975
But they're not
actually zero.

38:15.575 --> 38:17.215
Well, many fertility clinics

38:17.215 --> 38:20.335
won't even attempt IVF on
someone whose FSH is that high.

38:20.335 --> 38:23.575
It wouldn't be ethical
for them to take your money.
Money's not the problem.

38:23.575 --> 38:25.575
OK, but, then consider
how you want to spend it.

38:25.575 --> 38:28.255
I mean, adoption,
surrogacy,

38:28.255 --> 38:30.855
egg donation,
those things cost, too.

38:30.855 --> 38:32.295
Yeah, well,
what if I wanted to try?

38:33.655 --> 38:35.495
Well, I couldn't recommend it.

38:35.495 --> 38:37.455
Would you help me?

38:37.455 --> 38:39.775
I wouldn't be comfortable
with that.

38:41.775 --> 38:45.575
I am sorry.
I know that it's rough.

38:45.575 --> 38:48.055
But you do have
alternatives.

38:48.055 --> 38:50.615
There are other ways
to have a family.

38:50.615 --> 38:52.615
(PAGER BEEPS)

38:52.615 --> 38:55.295
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

38:56.935 --> 38:59.975
Ceftriaxone and metronidazole
have been given.

38:59.975 --> 39:02.215
We're headed up.

39:02.215 --> 39:04.175
Not much of a selection
at the gift shop.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.095
Oh, my God! Mozart!

39:06.095 --> 39:08.135
Thanks, Neela.
No problem.

39:08.135 --> 39:09.935
I'll be up later
to check on you.

39:09.935 --> 39:12.015
Another two of morphine
when she gets settled.

39:12.015 --> 39:13.975
Hey, you get any texts lately?

39:13.975 --> 39:17.055
Uh, she's a handful, this one.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.455
Oh, I see you've met
my daughter.

39:18.455 --> 39:20.015
(LAUGHS)

39:20.015 --> 39:22.735
She's taking the bus up
next week.

39:22.735 --> 39:25.695
Haven't seen her since
before I shipped out.

39:25.695 --> 39:26.735
Three years.

39:26.735 --> 39:28.375
She's going
to cry.
Yeah, well,

39:28.375 --> 39:31.415
that's what moms do
when they're happy.

39:31.415 --> 39:33.095
Hey, remember, Tuesday,
2.00, right?

39:33.095 --> 39:34.574
Dr Grasso.
That's right.

39:34.574 --> 39:36.374
Second floor.
Yeah, she's great.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.094
If you have any problem
with your meds,

39:38.094 --> 39:39.974
you need refills,
get a hold of me, OK?

39:39.974 --> 39:41.774
I don't know how
to thank you.

39:41.774 --> 39:43.254
Not necessary.

39:44.574 --> 39:46.894
I need one more favour.

39:46.894 --> 39:48.014
Hm?

39:48.014 --> 39:50.014
It's Jake.
Oh, yeah.

39:50.014 --> 39:51.894
Yeah, I'll drop him off
when I have time.

39:51.894 --> 39:53.814
No, they don't allow
dogs here.

39:53.814 --> 39:56.814
I was hoping maybe you
could hold onto him
for a little longer.

39:56.814 --> 39:57.854
Really?

39:57.854 --> 39:59.774
If you could.

39:59.774 --> 40:01.574
Yeah.
Yeah, I could.

40:01.574 --> 40:03.014
I'm sort of, uh,

40:03.014 --> 40:04.574
I'm sort of getting
used to him.

40:04.574 --> 40:05.974
I appreciate it.

40:05.974 --> 40:07.534
It's been weird
being alone.

40:07.534 --> 40:08.854
I don't mind being
on my own,

40:08.854 --> 40:12.174
but totally alone
gets hard, you know?

40:13.934 --> 40:15.254
Now, this, this is me.

40:20.614 --> 40:22.494
I want you to have this.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.454
Ah, come on, no.
Take it.

40:24.454 --> 40:25.654
You deserve it.

40:29.534 --> 40:31.494
Open it later.

40:34.934 --> 40:37.294
I'll see you around.

40:37.414 --> 40:39.414
I'll see you around.

40:48.894 --> 40:53.054
Hey, make sure you give Jake
some bacon. He loves bacon.

40:53.054 --> 40:55.054
And-and chicken, too.

40:56.294 --> 40:58.734
I'll remember that.

42:14.053 --> 42:17.253
Often... the best part of a meal
is the dessert.

42:17.813 --> 42:19.373
But sometimes everything adds up

42:19.493 --> 42:21.333
and after busy days

42:21.493 --> 42:24.213
you can just feel sluggish
or a bit bloated.

42:24.773 --> 42:26.453
Now there's something new.

42:26.573 --> 42:28.373
Activia Intensely Creamy.

42:29.053 --> 42:30.973
It's a deliciously
thick, creamy yogurt

42:31.133 --> 42:32.213
and because
it's from Activia

42:32.373 --> 42:33.973
it actually helps
your digestive health

42:34.093 --> 42:35.413
by improving transit.

42:35.533 --> 42:37.133
Mm... Works for me.

42:39.893 --> 42:41.813
A delicious new dessert
from Activia.

42:41.933 --> 42:42.613
# Mm... Danone!

43:13.932 --> 43:15.972
Sensations presents

43:16.052 --> 43:18.052
a journey through flavour.

43:20.372 --> 43:22.692
Let chilli and basil entice.

43:22.772 --> 43:24.812

43:25.292 --> 43:29.492
GENTLE BIRDSONG
Let sweetness delight.

43:31.372 --> 43:33.332
DRAMATIC DRUMMING

43:34.532 --> 43:36.732
And let heat thrill.

43:38.572 --> 43:41.092
Sensations Thai Sweet Chilli.

44:13.932 --> 44:14.932
Charity shop's going to be happy

44:15.052 --> 44:16.332
with all this stuff
from your clear-out.

44:16.412 --> 44:17.412
Too true, Happy.

44:17.532 --> 44:19.492
We could give away
something free, too.

44:19.612 --> 44:21.691
- Contents insurance.
- What?

44:21.771 --> 44:23.251
Ooh!

44:25.371 --> 44:28.211
I thought you said
free contents insurance.

44:28.291 --> 44:29.331
Get your buildings insurance

44:29.411 --> 44:30.451
direct from Norwich Union

44:30.571 --> 44:31.571
and we'll give you
contents insurance

44:31.691 --> 44:32.611
absolutely
free.

44:34.651 --> 44:37.571
This Mother's Day,
bring the whole family together

44:37.691 --> 44:40.131
with a choice of
a traditional roast for four,

44:41.811 --> 44:44.131
a selection of
heart-warming vegetables,

44:45.851 --> 44:47.811
a gorgeous bottle of wine,

44:48.771 --> 44:50.731
and a fabulous dessert for four,

44:51.371 --> 44:53.931
like this irresistible
sticky toffee pudding.

44:54.971 --> 44:58.411
All for the deliciously low price
of Â£15.

44:59.491 --> 45:01.091
Happy Mother's Day from:

46:05.930 --> 46:07.810
How's he doing?
Hungry.

46:07.970 --> 46:10.050
I'm gonna go upstairs
and grab him a sandwich.

46:10.210 --> 46:12.370
He keeps asking
to see his brother.

46:12.370 --> 46:14.730
Hello, Quincy,
how are you?

46:14.730 --> 46:16.210
Fine.

46:16.210 --> 46:17.650
Getting the hang
of those crutches?

46:17.650 --> 46:19.610
Yeah. It's easy.

46:19.610 --> 46:22.090
You know, we're keeping
an eye on your brother.

46:22.090 --> 46:23.490
He seems to
be doing OK.

46:23.490 --> 46:25.570
I'm not leaving
until I see him.

46:25.690 --> 46:27.850
You miss him pretty bad, huh?

46:27.850 --> 46:30.850
You know, I hear
you run away a lot.

46:30.850 --> 46:33.210
I ran away once.

46:33.210 --> 46:35.130
You?
You're a grown-up.

46:35.130 --> 46:38.930
Well, sometimes we get
so sad, we get angry.

46:38.930 --> 46:40.570
We run away, too.

46:40.570 --> 46:41.890
I only do it
to see my brother.

46:41.890 --> 46:43.650
Foster home sucks.

46:43.650 --> 46:46.130
What do you guys
do together?

46:46.130 --> 46:47.210
Everything.

46:47.210 --> 46:48.570
Play ball, video games.

46:48.570 --> 46:50.770
Do homework.
Homework?

46:50.770 --> 46:53.330
Jermaine hates it
when I don't do my homework.

46:53.330 --> 46:56.410
Quincy, Jermaine
broke the law,

46:56.410 --> 46:58.610
put you in a very
dangerous situation.

46:58.610 --> 47:00.210
It's not like that.

47:00.210 --> 47:01.850
He told me to go home,
but I didn't.

47:01.850 --> 47:03.850
That doesn't make
what he did OK.

47:03.850 --> 47:05.450
You don't get it.
No, I don't.

47:05.450 --> 47:07.410
Why don't you explain it to me?

47:07.410 --> 47:09.890
He doesn't do that stuff.
Well, he did today.

47:09.890 --> 47:11.810
You saw for yourself.

47:11.810 --> 47:13.130
No.

47:13.130 --> 47:14.410
My parents worked all the time.

47:14.410 --> 47:16.370
It was always
just him and me.

47:16.370 --> 47:18.810
He picked me up at school,
cooked dinner...

47:18.810 --> 47:21.690
Quincy, you know, sometimes
the truth hurts so bad,

47:21.690 --> 47:23.210
we don't want to
believe certain things.

47:23.210 --> 47:24.410
He's not a drug dealer.

47:24.410 --> 47:25.690
The police say he is.

47:25.690 --> 47:27.210
Whatever.

47:27.210 --> 47:28.690
When do I get to see him?

47:33.329 --> 47:35.049
(WHISPERING) Hi.

47:35.049 --> 47:37.049
How are you feeling?

47:37.049 --> 47:38.169
(WHISPERING) Good.

47:39.689 --> 47:40.969
Why are you whispering?

47:40.969 --> 47:43.729
No, no, I'm being
inconspicuous.

47:43.729 --> 47:45.169
Ah.

47:45.169 --> 47:46.329
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
It's not working.
No?

47:46.329 --> 47:48.289
All right.
(LAUGHS)

47:48.289 --> 47:50.409
So you've, uh,
you've been cleared.

47:50.409 --> 47:51.689
You're healthy
as a horse.

47:51.689 --> 47:53.929
How's Jermaine
and his little brother?

47:53.929 --> 47:55.049
Jermaine
is stable.

47:55.049 --> 47:56.449
He's getting admitted
for observation.

47:56.449 --> 47:58.249
Quincy'll be on
crutches for a while,

47:58.249 --> 48:00.849
but he's going home today.
See? it's all good.

48:03.569 --> 48:05.049
Hey, can I ask
you something?

48:06.289 --> 48:09.089
Your family - they
know about you?

48:09.089 --> 48:12.129
They know I'm a cop,
but not about this.

48:12.129 --> 48:13.529
My mother would kill me.

48:13.529 --> 48:15.849
She already thinks
it's too dangerous.

48:15.849 --> 48:18.409
And...how about
your husband?

48:18.409 --> 48:20.849
Does he know?

48:20.849 --> 48:23.049
I'm not married.

48:23.049 --> 48:24.809
Boyfriend?

48:26.209 --> 48:28.609
I don't have one.

48:29.889 --> 48:30.889
Wow.

48:30.889 --> 48:32.689
Why do you keep
saying that?

48:32.769 --> 48:34.689
No reason.

48:37.369 --> 48:39.089
I have to say good-bye
to you now.

48:39.089 --> 48:40.569
No.

48:41.769 --> 48:43.729
Really?
Mm-hmm.

48:43.729 --> 48:44.569
OK.

48:44.569 --> 48:48.809
My supervisor's coming in
to take me back into custody.

48:48.809 --> 48:50.769
You know, the show must go on.

48:50.769 --> 48:53.849
Nobody knows you know.
I broke protocol when...

48:53.849 --> 48:55.929
Shh...
I'll take it to the grave.

48:58.369 --> 48:59.649
Ugh.

48:59.649 --> 49:02.529
Shut up and stop
touching me!

49:02.529 --> 49:04.089
Make sure you
keep this dry.

49:04.089 --> 49:06.088
Sorry about this one, Doc.
Oh, you know what?

49:06.088 --> 49:08.328
Don't sweat it, man, we
get this kind all the time.

49:08.328 --> 49:09.408
You got some
mouth on you!

49:09.408 --> 49:12.488
Little time in the pokey ought
to do you some good.

49:12.488 --> 49:13.968
Get her out
of my sight.

49:13.968 --> 49:15.528
I appreciate
everything you did here.

49:15.528 --> 49:17.088
Oh, it's just another
day in the life.

49:17.088 --> 49:18.888
Hey, you be
careful out there.

49:18.888 --> 49:21.528
And you - big attitude
adjustment! Big one!

49:21.528 --> 49:23.488
(SPITS)

49:23.488 --> 49:24.688
Punk ass.

49:24.688 --> 49:26.808
Where's the ladies' room?
I got to take a piss.

49:26.808 --> 49:28.168
Come on.

49:28.168 --> 49:31.328
Really making headway
with that one.

49:31.328 --> 49:33.008
I'm taking notes.

49:37.648 --> 49:41.768
Check with Frank, see if ICU
has a bed ready for him.

49:41.768 --> 49:44.208
So how am I doing, Doc?

49:44.208 --> 49:47.968
Uh, you don't seem
to be bleeding internally.

49:47.968 --> 49:49.408
I guess that's
good, right?

49:49.568 --> 49:51.368
You're going
to the intensive care unit,

49:51.368 --> 49:52.848
and while you're up there,

49:52.848 --> 49:54.328
you're going to talk
to the police.

49:54.328 --> 49:56.488
What is your problem?
I already told you I'm
not about to go up there

49:56.688 --> 49:58.408
and snitch on nobody.
And you are going
to tell them

49:58.408 --> 50:00.208
everything that you know.

50:00.208 --> 50:01.968
Oh, I, oh, I...

50:02.048 --> 50:03.448
(LAUGHS)

50:03.448 --> 50:05.208
(COUGHS)

50:05.208 --> 50:06.808
Boy, you think
this is funny?

50:06.808 --> 50:08.528
Go ahead and laugh.

50:08.648 --> 50:10.128
(LAUGHS)

50:13.728 --> 50:14.968
Laugh your dumb ass

50:15.128 --> 50:17.208
all the way
to the penitentiary.

50:17.208 --> 50:21.168
You want to know why you're
going to tell them everything?

50:27.288 --> 50:29.408
Come on.

50:36.088 --> 50:38.088
Yo, Quince.

50:38.288 --> 50:41.127
What's up?
How you doing?

50:42.807 --> 50:45.367
I'm all right.

50:45.367 --> 50:46.647
He's why.

50:46.647 --> 50:50.447
You want to raise him,
do what's best for him?

50:50.607 --> 50:53.647
Then set an example
and co-operate.

50:57.727 --> 50:59.327
You know what?
It's fine.

50:59.327 --> 51:01.727
Don't worry about me.
I'm good.

51:03.527 --> 51:04.727
Yeah.

51:04.727 --> 51:06.807
No, I'm... yeah, I'm sure.

51:06.807 --> 51:08.807
I'm totally sure.

51:08.807 --> 51:10.847
You go have fun
with your friends

51:10.847 --> 51:12.647
and I'll pick you up
in the morning, OK?

51:12.647 --> 51:14.007
I promise.

51:14.007 --> 51:15.527
OK.

51:15.527 --> 51:16.567
Hey, Sarah.

51:16.567 --> 51:18.287
I love you, OK?

51:20.407 --> 51:22.087
I love you more.

51:22.087 --> 51:23.487
Bye.

51:25.927 --> 51:27.287
Charlie.

51:52.687 --> 51:55.287
I was called down
for a consult.

51:55.287 --> 51:56.487
Where's the patient?

51:56.487 --> 51:57.687
I'm right here.

51:57.687 --> 51:59.887
I want to try IVF.
What?

51:59.887 --> 52:01.727
Will you please help me?

52:03.927 --> 52:06.607
All right, you called me down
for a consult on yourself?

52:06.607 --> 52:08.087
Well, I couldn't leave
the floor

52:08.087 --> 52:09.687
and I want
to try in vitro.

52:09.687 --> 52:11.687
This may be
my last chance.

52:11.687 --> 52:13.447
I told you I'm not
comfortable with it.
I know.

52:13.447 --> 52:16.526
It's only a small chance,
but it's a chance.

52:16.526 --> 52:20.046
Yes, but hormone treatments
have risks - polyps, fibroids.

52:20.046 --> 52:22.126
Do you really want to put
your body through all that?

52:22.126 --> 52:23.606
I have to give it a try.

52:23.606 --> 52:25.526
Even though failure is
the most likely outcome?

52:25.526 --> 52:29.326
If it doesn't work,
I'll move on, but one try.

52:31.246 --> 52:34.366
Let me think about it.

52:34.366 --> 52:37.326
But I'm not promising
anything, OK?

52:37.326 --> 52:39.486
I'll call you.

52:46.446 --> 52:48.766
(MOBILE RINGS)

52:54.766 --> 52:56.886
TAGGART:
'Hi, this is Sam.

52:56.886 --> 52:59.966
'I can't get to my phone,
so leave a message.'

52:59.966 --> 53:01.406
Hey, Sam, it's Tony.

53:01.406 --> 53:03.446
Um, I just wanted to say

53:03.446 --> 53:05.966
that I'm really happy
that Alex is home

53:05.966 --> 53:08.966
and that he's OK
and, uh, um...

53:10.566 --> 53:13.406
..uh, that I want you
to tell him that I said hi

53:13.406 --> 53:15.006
and, um...

53:15.006 --> 53:18.566
that I'll see you soon, I hope.

53:18.566 --> 53:20.166
Goodbye.

53:21.446 --> 53:23.846
Tony! Hey.

53:23.846 --> 53:25.846
Daria.

53:25.846 --> 53:28.246
Top of the morning to you.
How are you?

53:28.246 --> 53:29.926
Are you working?
Top of the evening to you.

53:29.926 --> 53:31.366
Are you working?

53:31.366 --> 53:33.286
No, no, no, I have
a few days off.

53:33.286 --> 53:34.646
Actually,
I'm drinking.

53:34.646 --> 53:36.126
Oh, how's that going?

53:36.126 --> 53:37.566
It's good,
it's going good.

53:37.566 --> 53:39.046
I'm having a good day.

53:39.046 --> 53:40.646
I... I did something good.

53:40.646 --> 53:41.846
Really?

53:41.846 --> 53:44.886
Which I thought would make
me feel better, but...

53:44.886 --> 53:49.006
See, I had this, uh...
my best friend died.

53:51.845 --> 53:53.885
And my kid, she never...

53:58.285 --> 54:00.125
Never mind.

54:01.845 --> 54:03.805
How are you?

54:03.805 --> 54:05.125
I'm fine.

54:05.125 --> 54:06.365
(CHUCKLES)

54:08.085 --> 54:10.805
Why are you looking
at me like that?

54:22.845 --> 54:25.645
And I'm... And
you know what?

54:25.645 --> 54:26.845
I'm trouble.

54:26.845 --> 54:28.805
(CHUCKLING)
I'm trouble.

54:28.805 --> 54:31.165
Everything I
touch turns to...

54:34.485 --> 54:35.925
But...

54:37.485 --> 54:41.685
..you know, if you...if you
want to come home with me,

54:41.685 --> 54:43.685
no strings attached,

54:43.685 --> 54:46.605
just for one night,
we could...

55:06.445 --> 55:08.805
We should have Quincy moved
by the end of the week.

55:08.805 --> 55:10.485
That's great.

55:10.485 --> 55:12.605
And Jermaine's still
upstairs with the police.

55:12.605 --> 55:14.405
He must be telling 'em
something.

55:14.405 --> 55:15.725
It's been a while.

55:15.725 --> 55:17.885
I'll keep you posted.
Good night.
Good night.

55:31.684 --> 55:33.604
Hey, what are
you doing here?

55:33.604 --> 55:35.444
Taking you on a date.

55:35.444 --> 55:37.364
What?!

55:37.364 --> 55:42.204
I have reservations at
your favourite - Mia Francesca.

55:42.204 --> 55:44.164
What's the occasion?

55:44.164 --> 55:47.084
Pretty soon we may not
have time to go out.

55:47.084 --> 55:50.164
And you know,
I thought I might get lucky,

55:50.164 --> 55:52.564
since we're trying
and all.

55:53.844 --> 55:56.044
Are you OK?

55:56.044 --> 55:58.204
Yeah.

56:02.084 --> 56:04.244
Come on, let's talk
about it at dinner.

56:04.244 --> 56:05.964
I'm starving.

57:49.963 --> 57:52.083
Now I'm in my 40s,

57:52.083 --> 57:55.443
I've finally discovered the answer
for visibly firmer looking skin

57:59.003 --> 58:01.163
Boosts surface skin cell renewal

58:01.163 --> 58:03.443
leaving you with noticeably
firmer looking skin.

58:07.203 --> 58:08.763
Because beauty is a statement

58:40.762 --> 58:41.882
It's spring.

58:42.802 --> 58:44.762
The days are getting longer

58:44.842 --> 58:47.042
and the weather's getting warmer.

58:48.002 --> 58:50.042
How many more excuses do you need

58:50.122 --> 58:51.922
to treat yourself to a new wardrobe?

58:52.762 --> 58:54.282
Oh! There's one.

58:56.042 --> 58:57.042
..at Tesco.

59:09.922 --> 59:10.642
Right now,

59:10.722 --> 59:11.802
at Direct Line Car Insurance,

59:11.882 --> 59:13.002
you get 12 months' cover

59:13.082 --> 59:13.802

59:13.922 --> 59:16.002

preserves

59:16.122 --> 59:17.402
your no-claims
discount.
