26:00.141 --> 26:01.893
This isn't a jacuzzi.

26:01.977 --> 26:04.271
Uh, quick question. Sorry.
Great to meet you.

26:04.354 --> 26:07.524
-Uh, what time of day is it?
-It's 4:18.

26:07.607 --> 26:10.110
No, no, no, in-- in--
in the scene we're shooting.

26:10.193 --> 26:11.611
It's hard to know
the time of day,

26:11.695 --> 26:13.488
because space is always
so dark.

26:13.571 --> 26:14.614
-So dark.
-IRIS: Hmm.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.909
I believe in this
particular scene, it's 4:18.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.161
Wow. Weird coincidence.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.372
Now, meet Zara.

26:22.455 --> 26:25.792
Playing the new
Chief Science Officer, Sarah.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.794
Everyone, just so you know,

26:27.877 --> 26:30.338
yeah, the bird that got this gig
is back there.

26:30.422 --> 26:35.719
That's Zara, I am Sarah. Yeah.

26:35.802 --> 26:37.512
-You get that?
-TV RYAN: Sarah.

26:37.595 --> 26:39.180
-Cool.
-People like her.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.182
I don't know why. I don't care.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.642
She gives us profile,

26:42.726 --> 26:44.978
so she's the star
of the show now.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.314
(CHUCKLES)

26:47.397 --> 26:50.483
Hey, hey, anyone.
Am I gonna get a chair?

26:50.567 --> 26:51.985
Not being a diva,
but I'm just stood here

26:52.068 --> 26:54.946
like a fucking plum, so...
Anybody, hello?

26:55.030 --> 26:57.115
You, you're off the show.
Get out.

26:57.198 --> 27:00.535
-Oh, thank you so much. Bye.
-IRIS: Clean out your trailer.

27:01.828 --> 27:02.829
Cool.

27:04.372 --> 27:08.084
Spirited. I really hate that
in a person.
