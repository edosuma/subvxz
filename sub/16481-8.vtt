WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:02.784
<i>Previously on</i> scream queens...
Give him the procedure now!

00:02.853 --> 00:05.353
Or i will
shut this hospital down.

00:06.857 --> 00:08.556
A jane hollis filled out
a missing person's report

00:08.625 --> 00:10.725
<i>For her husband, bill.</i>

00:10.794 --> 00:12.227
I think if we find
this jane hollis,

00:12.295 --> 00:13.728
We might be able to figure out
who the killer is.

00:13.797 --> 00:15.797
People came by
from the hospital.

00:15.866 --> 00:17.232
They asked about you.

00:18.735 --> 00:20.501
<i>Do you think we need to</i>
<i>do something about it?</i>

00:20.570 --> 00:21.836
I'll take care of everything.

00:24.207 --> 00:25.240
The patient was admitted

00:25.308 --> 00:26.341
Complaining of lower back pain

00:26.409 --> 00:27.442
And abdominal cramps.

00:27.510 --> 00:28.843
Now, the routine x ray
showed a--

00:28.912 --> 00:30.745
An enormous mass
in his stomach.

00:30.814 --> 00:32.780
We don't have the results
from the mri yet.

00:32.849 --> 00:34.616
I don't understand.
Why do you need me?

00:34.684 --> 00:35.984
I don't need you,
he was asking about you.

00:36.052 --> 00:37.352
Said you guys used to date

00:37.420 --> 00:38.953
And his symptoms started
when you broke up.

00:39.022 --> 00:40.655
It's not hannity, is it?

00:40.724 --> 00:43.791
that was supposed
to be way on the d.L.

00:51.701 --> 00:52.901
Hi, cathy.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.836
Weston.

00:55.906 --> 00:57.705
What's going on?

00:57.774 --> 00:59.040
What's going on
is that mr. Gardner

00:59.109 --> 01:00.575
Has an abdominal tumor

01:00.644 --> 01:02.644
The size of a grapefruit.

01:02.712 --> 01:04.312
We need to get this thing out
immediately.

01:04.381 --> 01:07.181
Oh, dear god. Wes,

01:07.250 --> 01:09.484
When did the stomach
pains begin?

01:09.552 --> 01:11.819
When you left me, cathy.

01:11.888 --> 01:13.788
When you broke my heart.

01:13.857 --> 01:15.857
That's sort of
when the pain started.

01:15.926 --> 01:18.126
Wait. You guys used to go out?

01:18.194 --> 01:19.928
Um, yes, we did.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.664
As a matter of fact.

01:22.732 --> 01:24.999
After the wallace murders...

01:26.636 --> 01:28.803
...Cathy and i ran off together.

01:30.807 --> 01:32.540
<i>I got a part-time job</i>

01:32.609 --> 01:33.841
<i>Teaching english</i>

01:33.910 --> 01:35.476
<i>At the university of</i>
<i>rural oregon</i>

01:35.545 --> 01:37.045
<i>So i could fulfill</i>
<i>my lifelong dream</i>

01:37.113 --> 01:38.980
<i>Of growing a beard</i>
<i>and living in a log cabin</i>

01:39.049 --> 01:40.648
<i>And staring a microbrewery.</i>

01:40.717 --> 01:43.751
How's the pumpkin dunkelweizen?

01:43.820 --> 01:45.253
Really good.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.821
Mmm.
yeah.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.633
<i>See, as it turns out,</i>

01:58.702 --> 02:01.069
<i>Cathy was just pretending</i>
<i>to be super supportive,</i>

02:01.137 --> 02:02.904
When all she really wanted to do
was drive a wedge

02:02.973 --> 02:04.372
Between my daughter and me,

02:04.441 --> 02:06.674
Whom i ended up not seeing
for over a year.

02:10.647 --> 02:12.180
Cut through the fundus.

02:12.248 --> 02:13.648
Retractor, please.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.650
And then a bunch of people
got botulism

02:15.719 --> 02:17.151
From my french toast-infused ipa

02:17.220 --> 02:19.520
Because a bunch of mice
got into the mash

02:19.589 --> 02:22.223
And my book about quarters
was a huge flop.

02:22.292 --> 02:23.658
Um, shouldn't we be
putting him under?

02:23.727 --> 02:25.560
He insisted on staying awake
during the procedure.

02:25.628 --> 02:27.362
So i gave him an epidural.

02:27.430 --> 02:29.530
Retractor.
Yeah, you need to hear this,
cathy.

02:29.599 --> 02:31.733
You need to know the devastation
that you caused

02:31.801 --> 02:33.935
When you just up
and walked out of my life!

02:34.004 --> 02:35.603
Hey, hold on.

02:35.672 --> 02:37.605
You wrote a book about quarters?

02:37.674 --> 02:39.107
Yes. It was called

02:39.175 --> 02:41.409
An american history.

02:44.014 --> 02:47.115
Damn it, it's our
most important coin.

02:48.318 --> 02:49.717
No, all right.

02:49.786 --> 02:51.786
Look, i said it then,

02:53.189 --> 02:54.756
I just don't see how you can say

02:54.824 --> 02:55.990
That one coin is more important

02:56.059 --> 02:57.759
Than another.
Yeah,

02:57.827 --> 02:59.394
I know, cathy.

02:59.462 --> 03:00.828
I remember.

03:00.897 --> 03:03.031
Because that was the last thing
that you said to me

03:03.099 --> 03:05.767
Before you walked
out of my life forever.

03:05.835 --> 03:08.236
And that's when
the stomach pain started.

03:08.304 --> 03:09.570
Look, wes,

03:09.639 --> 03:12.774
I promise i will try to
make this right for you.

03:12.842 --> 03:13.975
Huh. This is really weird.

03:14.044 --> 03:15.243
What?

03:15.311 --> 03:16.711
What? What? What's weird?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.646
That thing in your stomach,

03:18.715 --> 03:20.982
It's not a tumor.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.589
It's a giant hair ball.

03:28.658 --> 03:30.058
Looks like trump's wig.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.259
Oh.

03:38.268 --> 03:40.001
It's called trichobezoar.

03:40.070 --> 03:41.102
It's, uh...

03:41.171 --> 03:42.837
Basically doctor talk
for hair ball.

03:43.873 --> 03:45.673
Listen, you know,

03:45.742 --> 03:47.208
You would have made our lives
a lot easier

03:47.277 --> 03:48.509
And the operation a lot safer

03:48.578 --> 03:50.311
If you just would have
told us the truth.

03:50.380 --> 03:51.546
How did he get that much
hair in his stomach?

03:51.614 --> 03:53.381
Duh. He's obviously been dating

03:53.450 --> 03:54.682
One of those occupy wall street

03:54.751 --> 03:55.783
Or pussy riot girls,

03:55.852 --> 03:57.652
Who think
not shaving their cooter

03:57.720 --> 03:58.786
Is some kind of
political protest

03:58.855 --> 04:00.655
Against the patriarchy
or something.

04:00.723 --> 04:02.490
Are you saying that
that's a giant ziploc bag

04:02.559 --> 04:04.826
Full of commie pubes?
Mm-hmm.

04:04.894 --> 04:06.294
No, they're not pubes.
Mr. Gardner suffers from

04:06.362 --> 04:07.662
A condition called
trichophagia.

04:07.730 --> 04:09.797
Oh, it's from the greek.

04:09.866 --> 04:11.466
Trichia meaning "hair,"

04:11.534 --> 04:13.701
And phagein meaning "to eat."
yes.

04:13.770 --> 04:15.103
Exactly, that's
exactly right, yeah.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.871
It's a psychological
disorder

04:16.940 --> 04:19.674
That causes, uh,
people to pull out

04:19.742 --> 04:20.675
And then eat their own hair.

04:20.743 --> 04:21.943
Number five,

04:22.011 --> 04:23.311
How have you never come down
with that?

04:23.379 --> 04:25.780
Seriously. That seems
right up your alley.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.548
Look, like i told you guys
during the surgery,

04:27.617 --> 04:30.118
I was all stressed out
after cathy and i broke up.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.385
I was managing pretty well

04:31.454 --> 04:32.653
Until grace moved to stanford

04:32.722 --> 04:34.655
To work on her master's.

04:34.724 --> 04:37.291
She is... So far away.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.227
She's doing great, by the way.

04:39.295 --> 04:40.561
Thanks for any of you

04:40.630 --> 04:42.864
For bothering to
ask. Anyway...

04:42.932 --> 04:44.065
The beer company was a bust,

04:44.134 --> 04:45.366
My first book tanked,

04:45.435 --> 04:46.667
And i lost my job
at rural oregon

04:46.736 --> 04:48.703
Because i refused
to use trigger warnings

04:48.771 --> 04:50.004
Before screening horror movies

04:50.073 --> 04:51.005
To the students.

04:51.074 --> 04:52.607
Obama's america.

04:52.675 --> 04:54.675
<i>I was home alone all the time.</i>

04:54.744 --> 04:56.911
<i>All stressed out,</i>
<i>trying to write my second book,</i>

04:56.980 --> 04:58.946
Historical playlists.

04:59.015 --> 05:01.115
<i>And one day, i just started</i>
<i>picking out my hair</i>

05:01.184 --> 05:03.384
<i>And eating it.</i>

05:03.453 --> 05:06.654
<i>I didn't even realize</i>
<i>that i was doing it.</i>

05:06.723 --> 05:08.723
<i>It was-- it was unconscious.</i>

05:08.791 --> 05:11.025
<i>Before i knew it,</i>
<i>i had this giant bald spot</i>

05:11.094 --> 05:13.127
<i>On the side of my head.</i>

05:13.196 --> 05:15.329
Yeah, that went on
for about three months.

05:17.467 --> 05:19.000
I went to a tony robbins seminar

05:19.068 --> 05:20.735
And he got me to stop
by yelling at me.

05:21.804 --> 05:23.604
That man's head is
even bigger in person.

05:23.673 --> 05:24.605
Yeah.

05:24.674 --> 05:25.940
And i-i thought that

05:26.009 --> 05:27.575
I had just poo-pooed out
all of my hair.

05:27.644 --> 05:30.378
I had no idea that
it was stuck in there.

05:30.446 --> 05:32.613
I'm just glad that
this all worked out.
Sweet.

05:34.184 --> 05:36.450
And i guess it kind of
gave me an excuse

05:36.519 --> 05:38.219
To come see you again, cathy.

05:39.289 --> 05:41.022
And i'm grateful

05:41.090 --> 05:43.357
That my hair grew back
before i did.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.759
Yeah.

05:44.827 --> 05:46.060
I really love that big,

05:46.129 --> 05:48.596
Bushy head of hair.

05:48.665 --> 05:50.164
I used to get naked

05:50.233 --> 05:51.465
And put him in a headlock

05:51.534 --> 05:52.466
Between my thighs

05:52.535 --> 05:53.467
And then look in the mirror

05:53.536 --> 05:55.069
And try to pretend

05:55.138 --> 05:57.438
I was a porn star
from the 1970s.
Oh, man...

05:58.841 --> 05:59.907
Wait, stop it.

05:59.976 --> 06:01.876
You remember?
Of course i remember.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.544
Do you still have those...

06:03.613 --> 06:05.079
I have the polaroids.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.848
Oh, oh...
Oh, my...

06:07.917 --> 06:09.383
Those--
those were good times.

06:10.853 --> 06:12.220
Sorry.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.688
Sorry.

06:13.756 --> 06:15.289
Oops.
Um... Dr. Holt,

06:15.358 --> 06:16.691
Uh, if i am well enough,

06:16.759 --> 06:18.192
Do you think that...

06:18.261 --> 06:20.528
I could take this
beautiful young woman

06:20.597 --> 06:22.763
Out for dinner tonight?

06:22.832 --> 06:26.234
Maybe give her a little bit
of... Sex after?

06:26.302 --> 06:28.069
Okay.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.670
I think i'm gonna
go to my office.

06:29.739 --> 06:32.340
Um, girls, your rounds.

06:32.408 --> 06:33.841
Doctor...

06:36.679 --> 06:38.112
Now, you two have, uh,

06:38.181 --> 06:39.180
Chemistry, huh?

06:39.249 --> 06:40.648
What are you, jealous?

06:40.717 --> 06:43.317
Oh, no.

06:43.386 --> 06:44.619
Chanel and i are
doing great.

06:44.687 --> 06:46.854
She is really, really
a terrific girl.

06:46.923 --> 06:49.490
A lot of reallys.
Yeah.

06:49.559 --> 06:51.025
So, are you two gonna
start dating again?

06:51.094 --> 06:52.426
Well,

06:52.495 --> 06:54.862
I think considering our past,

06:54.931 --> 06:57.064
And the fact that you are
<i>really</i> unavailable,

06:57.133 --> 06:58.366
I think there's a
very good chance

06:58.434 --> 06:59.734
That wes and i

06:59.802 --> 07:01.602
Will be exchanging
a hair ball or two,

07:01.671 --> 07:02.670
If you know what i mean.

07:02.739 --> 07:04.338
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

07:04.407 --> 07:06.574
Do you have a problem with that?

07:06.643 --> 07:07.942
no.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.477
No, i'm just glad that
we're all...

07:09.545 --> 07:10.945
So damn happy.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.947
Good. Me, too.

07:17.654 --> 07:18.686
Hey, kids,

07:18.755 --> 07:20.488
Shay-day zayday here,

07:20.556 --> 07:21.522
And i know you guys are asking,

07:21.591 --> 07:23.457
"what's the gag for the day?"

07:23.526 --> 07:25.459
Well, i'm here to tell you
that the gag is

07:25.528 --> 07:28.663
We're curing everybody
in this hospital.

07:28.731 --> 07:31.699
Hey, gramps, what's the gag
with you?
Uh,

07:31.768 --> 07:34.135
I'm sorry? T-t-the what?

07:34.203 --> 07:36.704
You know, the gag, the dope,
the hibby-jibby.

07:36.773 --> 07:38.539
Mr. Abromowitz,
it looks like you've been

07:38.608 --> 07:40.541
Diagnosed with tuberculosis.

07:40.610 --> 07:43.744
1918 called,
it wants its disease back.

07:43.813 --> 07:45.313
Mwah!

07:45.381 --> 07:47.014
All right, zay-niacs,

07:47.083 --> 07:49.984
That's the gag for the day.

07:54.824 --> 07:56.891
Ugh!

08:02.165 --> 08:04.365
Ugh!

08:08.438 --> 08:10.671
Hmm.

08:12.809 --> 08:14.842
What?

08:14.911 --> 08:17.011
Hmm.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.014
<i>What's up?</i>
<i>I got a surprise for you.</i>

08:20.083 --> 08:23.551
You ready? Ah!

08:25.788 --> 08:27.555
Have you ever courted
a girl before?

08:27.623 --> 08:28.823
Yeah, tons of girls.

08:28.891 --> 08:30.658
Ever close the deal?

08:30.727 --> 08:31.992
Few times.

08:32.061 --> 08:33.861
Actually once.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.597
Online thing. You know,
cyber sex, you know.

08:36.666 --> 08:38.699
But when we actually met,
it turned out to be

08:38.768 --> 08:40.735
My cousin leon catfishing me
'cause he was mad

08:40.803 --> 08:43.471
That i took the last turkey leg
two years ago at thanksgiving.

08:43.539 --> 08:45.873
But that boy
can write some cyber.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.742
He need to do
an erotic novel.

08:47.810 --> 08:49.577
Here's the gag.

08:49.645 --> 08:51.746
Girls don't like it
when you're eager.

08:51.814 --> 08:54.548
Any time i post anything on
social media or text you,

08:54.617 --> 08:57.385
You respond before i even get
a chance to finish typing,

08:57.453 --> 08:59.387
And... It's unattractive.

08:59.455 --> 09:02.857
Look, i like you, but
when you seem desperate,

09:02.925 --> 09:05.025
It's a turn-off.

09:05.094 --> 09:06.994
Damn, zayday.

09:07.063 --> 09:08.662
All right. Well,
you know what? Noted.

09:08.731 --> 09:10.898
Can i talk to you
about something?

09:10.967 --> 09:13.934
I was thinking about the costume
that the green meanie wears.

09:14.003 --> 09:16.070
It's very specific
and elaborate.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.371
You can't just buy
something like that

09:17.440 --> 09:18.873
At a costume store,
which means he had...

09:18.941 --> 09:21.075
Either the killer is
an expert tailor and mask maker,

09:21.144 --> 09:23.043
Or he had it made
by someone who is.

09:23.112 --> 09:25.279
Okay, i was thinking
the second option.

09:25.348 --> 09:27.214
Okay, so, then,
all we have to do

09:27.283 --> 09:29.216
Is use ourselves
as bait to draw

09:29.285 --> 09:31.085
The green meanie in,
and then figure out a way

09:31.154 --> 09:32.887
To cut a piece of
fabric off his costume

09:32.955 --> 09:34.722
And bring it around to all
the fabric stores in the area,

09:34.791 --> 09:36.223
See if they recognize it

09:36.292 --> 09:37.625
Like they do in
those forensics shows.

09:37.693 --> 09:39.894
Okay, this is not
a forensics show, all right?

09:39.962 --> 09:41.629
That is an unnecessarily
dangerous

09:41.697 --> 09:43.631
And extremely complicated plan!

09:43.699 --> 09:45.766
Why don't we just go to the
shops and describe it to 'em?

09:45.835 --> 09:47.701
Not if they're in on it
in some way.

09:47.770 --> 09:50.171
We need a piece of evidence
to put pressure on them to talk.

09:50.239 --> 09:51.939
If they know there's a way
we can tie 'em to the murders,

09:52.008 --> 09:53.541
They'll be more willing
to give up the killer.

09:53.609 --> 09:56.544
just hope we don't get
killed in the process.

09:56.612 --> 09:59.547
Although it may stop me
from texting you as much.

09:59.615 --> 10:01.515
wishful thinking.

10:01.584 --> 10:03.284
What?!

10:03.352 --> 10:06.187
I can't believe
you don't like my text messages.

10:06.255 --> 10:08.622
You know, i often wonder
what my life would be like

10:08.691 --> 10:10.458
If i didn't become a surgeon.

10:12.628 --> 10:14.528
Are you recording this?

10:14.597 --> 10:16.530
Yeah. I have this amazing filter
that makes you look

10:16.599 --> 10:18.699
Like a dog with a huge tongue.
Keep talking.

10:18.768 --> 10:21.869
Well, my dad wanted me
to become a lawyer...

10:21.938 --> 10:23.704
Oh, my god,
that's hilarious!

10:23.773 --> 10:25.673
...Because he represented
the nixon administration

10:25.741 --> 10:27.408
During the watergate hearing.

10:27.477 --> 10:28.876
Would you...? Do you mind

10:28.945 --> 10:31.078
Putting the phone
down, please?
Oh. Like here?

10:31.147 --> 10:33.514
No. I meant...
Yeah, that's what i meant.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.550
I'm listening!

10:36.619 --> 10:39.186
Your uncle sold waterford
crystal to cynthia nixon.

10:39.255 --> 10:43.023
Yeah. Anyway, it was...

10:43.092 --> 10:45.226
It was my mother.
My mother was the one

10:45.294 --> 10:47.127
Who wanted me to become a doctor
'cause she really loved<i> m*a*s*h.</i>

10:47.196 --> 10:49.730
Wait. What? Mash, like...

10:49.799 --> 10:51.732
Oh, like mash potatoes?

10:51.801 --> 10:54.735
No. Like,<i> m*a*s*h</i> the tv show.

10:54.804 --> 10:56.971
You know. Took place
during the korean war?

10:59.175 --> 11:00.674
But it was really about vietnam?

11:00.743 --> 11:03.110
Uh...

11:03.179 --> 11:05.913
Only the most popular television
show in the history of tv?

11:05.982 --> 11:08.749
I think you mean
<i>boy meets world.</i>

11:08.818 --> 11:10.751
<i>Boy meets world.</i>
Uh, hello?

11:10.820 --> 11:12.753
<i>Boy meets world?</i>
Cory and topanga.

11:12.822 --> 11:14.588
The greatest love story ever.

11:17.426 --> 11:18.959
you should really
watch<i> boy meets world.</i>

11:19.028 --> 11:20.561
You know...

11:20.630 --> 11:23.264
I'm starting to feel
the age gap a bit. Are you?

11:23.332 --> 11:25.633
I'm sorry. I'm trying. I mean...

11:25.701 --> 11:27.668
I listened
to the oldies station all day,

11:27.737 --> 11:29.637
I-i learned about blink-182

11:29.705 --> 11:31.939
And smash mouth
and chumbawamba...

11:32.008 --> 11:34.408
I got an idea. Let's go
to the bedroom. Shall we?

11:34.477 --> 11:35.476
Oh!

11:35.545 --> 11:36.610
Oh...

11:39.549 --> 11:41.015
Uh, yes!

11:42.351 --> 11:43.450
Yeah...

11:47.490 --> 11:49.623
Oh, yes.

11:49.692 --> 11:51.425
Mm-hmm.

11:51.494 --> 11:53.661
Are you having a good time?

11:53.729 --> 11:55.629
Yeah. Why?

11:55.698 --> 11:58.499
Well, you seem to be looking
around the room a lot...

11:58.568 --> 12:00.634
Quite a bit...

12:06.142 --> 12:07.508
Are you yawning?

12:07.577 --> 12:09.510
what?

12:09.579 --> 12:11.645
Yawning.
No! Why would...

12:11.714 --> 12:13.847
Oh...

12:13.916 --> 12:16.450
No?

12:21.924 --> 12:24.458
Are you texting?

12:25.561 --> 12:27.428
Mm... Uh, no.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.629
I'm snapchatting.

12:28.698 --> 12:29.997
Snapchatting?

12:30.066 --> 12:31.465
Look. Brock.

12:31.534 --> 12:32.866
I'm sorry, okay? But...

12:32.935 --> 12:34.535
I'm hot.

12:34.604 --> 12:36.036
I don't have to be good in bed.

12:36.105 --> 12:38.739
I just lay here
and let hot dudes pork me.

12:38.808 --> 12:41.542
But for you, i'll let you
look at my boobs.

12:41.611 --> 12:42.977
They're right here.

12:49.585 --> 12:51.051
<i>You missed me,</i>

12:51.120 --> 12:52.987
Didn't you?

12:54.991 --> 12:56.557
A real woman,

12:56.626 --> 12:59.093
Who's been around the block
a couple times.

12:59.161 --> 13:01.462
You know, a brassy old girl

13:01.530 --> 13:03.664
Who really knows
what she's doing.

13:03.733 --> 13:06.333
Oh, cathy...
Good...

13:06.402 --> 13:08.902
What did you just say?

13:08.971 --> 13:10.571
What? Did you just
call me cathy?

13:10.640 --> 13:12.406
No! No, i said...

13:12.475 --> 13:13.540
Bathy.

13:13.609 --> 13:15.576
Oh, bathy.
Yeah. I...

13:15.645 --> 13:18.545
Look, i-i love making love
to you, but sometimes

13:18.614 --> 13:21.148
I think it would be great
if we just lit some candles

13:21.217 --> 13:23.751
And... And popped some
champagne and took a bathy.

13:23.819 --> 13:25.519
Oh, do you?
Yeah.

13:25.588 --> 13:26.887
No! Nuh-uh!

13:26.956 --> 13:28.422
You just called me cathy,

13:28.491 --> 13:30.424
Because you were thinking
of dean munsch.

13:30.493 --> 13:32.226
I was... That's crazy.

13:32.294 --> 13:33.761
Is that her first name, even?

13:33.829 --> 13:34.995
You know what?

13:35.064 --> 13:36.263
Continue.

13:36.332 --> 13:37.765
I'll be listening to spotify.

13:37.833 --> 13:41.035
That way you can yell the name
of whatever dusty old hag

13:41.103 --> 13:42.569
Takes you there.

13:51.647 --> 13:53.113
Looking for me?

13:54.650 --> 13:57.418
mm.

14:56.278 --> 14:58.779
surprise, bitch.

15:00.883 --> 15:02.649
Now!

15:18.768 --> 15:20.300
Oh...

15:47.096 --> 15:48.162
You okay?

15:48.230 --> 15:49.830
I'm fine.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.734
I got it.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.718
Here we go! Get ready...

16:02.787 --> 16:04.720
Set... And go!

16:10.795 --> 16:12.795
Well, hey, brock.

16:13.965 --> 16:16.499
Well! I just broke out

16:16.567 --> 16:18.701
The old workout tapes,
just trying to get my body back

16:18.770 --> 16:21.537
Into fine-tuned shape
now that wes gardner

16:21.606 --> 16:22.938
Is back in my pants.

16:23.007 --> 16:25.341
Oh! Something i
learned from him...

16:25.410 --> 16:26.942
The male multiple orgasm?

16:27.011 --> 16:28.344
Not a myth.

16:28.413 --> 16:30.746
I think i made
a terrible mistake.

16:30.815 --> 16:32.715
What?

16:32.784 --> 16:35.217
Chanel's great and all, but...

16:35.286 --> 16:38.621
The thing is, usually when
you sleep with a 24-year old,

16:38.689 --> 16:41.190
The sex is, like...
You know.

16:41.259 --> 16:43.726
You can't walk for weeks.
It's a whole thing.
Yeah.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.561
The issues really start
when you have to, you know,

16:45.630 --> 16:47.430
Actually talk to them.
And with chanel...
Mm-hmm.

16:47.498 --> 16:50.032
...The whole thing is lame.

16:50.101 --> 16:51.734
Oh, poor brock.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.770
Rest assured, you are not

16:54.839 --> 16:57.239
The first seaman
to have been fooled

16:57.308 --> 17:00.276
By the st. Elmo's fire
of a young girl furburger.

17:00.344 --> 17:03.679
I'm just sorry that you came
to your senses too late.

17:03.748 --> 17:06.015
You see, you and wes

17:06.083 --> 17:07.783
Are virtually interchangeable.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.385
I mean, he's six foot...

17:09.454 --> 17:13.355
Whatever, brown hair,
blue eyes. Well-educated.

17:13.424 --> 17:16.592
Aware there's a g-spot
and know how to find it.
Please, dean munsch.

17:16.661 --> 17:17.893
"please, dean munsch,"
what, sweetheart?

17:19.831 --> 17:21.130
Please, dean munsch,
will you... Give us

17:21.199 --> 17:22.798
The night off
so i can go get those shoes

17:22.867 --> 17:24.133
That chanel really wants?

17:24.202 --> 17:25.768
Hmm. That's what i thought.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.770
Oh, my darling.
You're the best!

17:27.839 --> 17:29.805
Mm!
Oh!

17:29.874 --> 17:31.774
I can't<i> wait</i> to get
into bed with you later

17:31.843 --> 17:33.242
And rock your world.

17:33.311 --> 17:35.110
Mm-hmm.
If you play your
cards right,

17:35.179 --> 17:36.912
I may even move a little.

17:38.716 --> 17:39.615
Hmm.

17:43.488 --> 17:46.856
So, i don't know if menopause
makes old crones

17:46.924 --> 17:49.825
Lose their ability
to think or see clearly,

17:49.894 --> 17:52.628
But dr. Brock holt is my man.

17:53.931 --> 17:55.631
Oh, you.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.300
Sweet, sweet girl.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.069
You see,
he's your man

18:00.137 --> 18:02.071
Because i let him be your man,

18:02.139 --> 18:06.242
And he will be your man until
i decide to take him from you.

18:06.310 --> 18:07.810
Which won't be very difficult.

18:07.879 --> 18:10.012
You see,
men like brock

18:10.081 --> 18:12.915
Seem to be attracted to women
who can do long division.

18:12.984 --> 18:15.684
and who have a sex swing
in their bedrooms.

18:18.422 --> 18:20.523
Enjoy it while it lasts.

18:24.195 --> 18:26.929
Wait a minute...

18:26.998 --> 18:30.332
Why am i leaving? This is my
office. You should be exiting.

18:30.401 --> 18:33.102
I am not exiting just so
you can end our conversation

18:33.170 --> 18:34.670
On your dramatic threat.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.372
Why would i help
you like that?

18:36.440 --> 18:38.674
I am just gonna stand here.

18:38.743 --> 18:39.875
Hmm.

18:40.978 --> 18:42.878
Okay.

18:42.947 --> 18:44.580
Make yourself at home.

18:45.983 --> 18:46.982
Mm.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.130
<i>She says i text her too much.</i>

19:01.198 --> 19:03.933
And yeah, maybe i do.
Like, when i get up in
the morning, i'll send her

19:04.001 --> 19:06.201
A text, like, "hey, i just woke
up, are you still asleep?"

19:06.270 --> 19:09.338
But then she won't text me back!
So, then i'll be, like, look.

19:09.407 --> 19:11.140
No need to write me back
if you still asleep,

19:11.208 --> 19:13.175
But then i'm, like, she not
asleep. She got to be awake.

19:13.244 --> 19:15.344
So now i'll text again,
like, look. If you asleep,

19:15.413 --> 19:17.413
It's okay. But call me
when you wake up.

19:17.481 --> 19:18.914
Though you should
not feel obligated...

19:18.983 --> 19:21.216
Okay! I'm gonna stop you
right there.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.651
Give me your phone.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.019
What? Why?

19:24.088 --> 19:25.988
Because you're being
a total creeper.

19:26.057 --> 19:28.524
I mean, i would be stunned
if zayday hasn't already

19:28.593 --> 19:30.693
Taken out a restraining
order against you.

19:30.761 --> 19:32.828
Chanel's right.
You're definitely blowing it.

19:32.897 --> 19:34.663
Um... I don't agree.

19:34.732 --> 19:38.100
I, for one, would<i> love</i> if
a guy would text me that much.

19:38.169 --> 19:39.401
Or at all.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.370
There. Problem solved.

19:41.439 --> 19:43.272
I blocked zayday's number
from your phone.

19:43.341 --> 19:45.074
That way if she texts you,
you won't know,

19:45.142 --> 19:47.209
So you won't be tempted
to text her back right away.

19:47.278 --> 19:49.411
Then at 9:00 p.M. On the dot,
every day, the phone will

19:49.480 --> 19:52.114
Automatically unblock her
number, and you'll receive

19:52.183 --> 19:53.882
Any text messages she may have
sent you throughout the day,

19:53.951 --> 19:54.950
And you're allowed
to respond with...

19:55.019 --> 19:57.786
One text.

19:57.855 --> 19:59.455
Then after an hour,
your phone will automatically

19:59.523 --> 20:00.789
Reblock the number
and it'll seem

20:00.858 --> 20:02.257
Like you're playing it cool,

20:02.326 --> 20:03.892
And she'll probably
be less creeped out by you

20:03.961 --> 20:06.228
And that's my good deed
for the year!

20:06.297 --> 20:08.230
Oh, and don't think just because
i'm helping you doesn't mean

20:08.299 --> 20:09.632
I don't think that
you're the green meanie

20:09.700 --> 20:11.066
Because i still
have my suspicions.

20:11.135 --> 20:13.168
All right, that's like
a double-double negative

20:13.237 --> 20:15.170
And a negative, but whatever...
Whatever that means,

20:15.239 --> 20:17.039
I'll take it, okay?
Thanks, chanels.

20:19.777 --> 20:21.043
Who the hell i'm-a text?

20:25.716 --> 20:27.483
Come back tomorrow,
we're closed.

20:27.551 --> 20:29.952
Please, no,
it'll only take a second.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.655
I just need to know if
you've seen this fabric before?

20:41.732 --> 20:43.966
Why don't you come in?

20:49.740 --> 20:51.774
Oh, i-i'm so sorry. I've just...

20:51.842 --> 20:55.611
Been in every fabric store
in a 50-mile radius, and...

21:00.785 --> 21:04.653
Maybe you can tell me where
someone might've gotten that?

21:04.722 --> 21:06.889
Follow me.

21:24.975 --> 21:26.108
Aah!

21:26.177 --> 21:29.244
Midnight green velvet pleather.

21:29.313 --> 21:30.913
Very exotic.

21:30.981 --> 21:32.948
So you've seen
that fabric before?

21:33.017 --> 21:33.982
Oh, yes.

21:34.051 --> 21:36.285
I've made several
interesting costumes

21:36.353 --> 21:37.586
With this fabric

21:37.655 --> 21:40.589
Big, scary ones.

21:40.658 --> 21:42.958
With a green mask and horns.

21:43.027 --> 21:44.893
I think we're talking
about the same costume.

21:44.962 --> 21:47.296
Like, uh, uh,
a swamp monster

21:47.364 --> 21:48.964
With a long, green cape?

21:49.033 --> 21:51.066
Yes, that's the one.

21:51.135 --> 21:53.102
I made three of them.
Same design,

21:53.170 --> 21:54.703
But different sizes.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.505
When was this?

21:56.574 --> 21:59.274
One was years ago.

21:59.343 --> 22:00.909
1986, i think.

22:00.978 --> 22:02.611
I-i remember the year,
because that was year

22:02.680 --> 22:04.346
<i>Karate kid ii</i> came out.

22:04.415 --> 22:05.748
I got a handy in the theater.

22:05.816 --> 22:07.750
The next one was

22:07.818 --> 22:09.585
A few months ago.

22:09.653 --> 22:11.086
I remember that one
because i went to try

22:11.155 --> 22:13.088
This new italian
place in town,

22:13.157 --> 22:15.124
And i got a handy
under the table.

22:15.192 --> 22:18.427
The last one was just
a few weeks ago.

22:18.496 --> 22:22.131
I don't remember any handies
associated with that one.

22:22.199 --> 22:24.633
They all paid in cash.

22:24.702 --> 22:25.801
And i don't keep receipts.

22:25.870 --> 22:27.636
Wait, do you remember
anything else?

22:27.705 --> 22:30.072
Like who placed the order
or what they looked like?

22:30.141 --> 22:32.775
Well, the second one
was all by mail.

22:32.843 --> 22:34.276
They just sent me
the measurements

22:34.345 --> 22:36.145
And a p.O. Box
to mail the costume to.

22:36.213 --> 22:37.846
The first one
and the third one--

22:37.915 --> 22:39.982
It was the same person
who ordered those.

22:40.050 --> 22:42.751
Nice old lady.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.787
Pretty hands.

22:44.855 --> 22:46.321
But i don't remember her name.

22:46.390 --> 22:47.456
An old lady?

22:47.525 --> 22:49.258
Jane.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.759
It could be jane hollis.

22:50.828 --> 22:51.794
She could have got
the first and the third,

22:51.862 --> 22:54.630
But who ordered the second?

22:54.698 --> 22:55.764
Oh, uh, thanks.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.866
That's all
i need to know.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.570
Spotify, and i guess
i dozed off or something...

23:09.638 --> 23:10.671
Oh, my god, chanel!

23:10.739 --> 23:12.372
You are so lucky.

23:12.441 --> 23:15.642
Okay, if a hot doctor asked me
to take a bathy with him,

23:15.711 --> 23:18.045
I would think that i had
died and gone to heaven.

23:18.113 --> 23:21.181
He didn't say "bathy."
he said "cathy," as in dean

23:21.250 --> 23:23.550
Cathy boxmunch-- i mean,
if he's still hung up on her,

23:23.619 --> 23:25.385
I don't know what
i'm suppose to do.

23:25.454 --> 23:27.821
I mean, i'm hot,
i'm young, i'm skinny.

23:27.890 --> 23:30.057
She's as old as the hills
and a total bitch.

23:30.125 --> 23:31.558
How am i supposed
to compete with that?

23:31.627 --> 23:34.027
You could always put in
a little more effort.

23:34.096 --> 23:35.262
Well, how?

23:35.331 --> 23:37.264
Um, i don't know.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.699
Maybe, like, take sex
classes or something?

23:38.767 --> 23:40.300
"sex classes," number three?

23:40.369 --> 23:43.403
And where do you imagine
they offer these sex classes?

23:44.607 --> 23:48.275
Chanel, if i may.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.911
I believe you're going
about this all wrong.

23:52.114 --> 23:54.314
Hmm?

23:56.719 --> 23:59.186
Maybe it isn't about the sex.

23:59.255 --> 24:01.321
Maybe it's about
the cultural differences

24:01.390 --> 24:03.857
Between yours and brock's
respective generations.

24:03.926 --> 24:07.094
Maybe he and dean munsch can
bond over shared experiences

24:07.162 --> 24:08.629
In a way that you
and he never can.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.264
No...
But if that's the case,

24:10.332 --> 24:12.432
Then the solution is simple.

24:12.501 --> 24:13.901
We, the chanels,

24:13.969 --> 24:15.369
Are gonna teach
you everything

24:15.437 --> 24:17.070
That there is to know
about brock's generation.

24:17.139 --> 24:18.572
We are gonna throw him
a dinner party,

24:18.641 --> 24:20.374
And he is gonna feel
completely at home.

24:20.442 --> 24:23.143
And he's gonna be, like,
"oh, my god, chanel

24:23.212 --> 24:24.878
"gets me just as much

24:24.947 --> 24:27.114
As dean munsch does, except
she's younger and hotter."

24:27.182 --> 24:30.250
Hester, once again
you've proven yourself

24:30.319 --> 24:32.719
To be the sharpest,
most canny chanel.

24:32.788 --> 24:34.121
I mean, no wonder
you found it so easy

24:34.189 --> 24:35.923
To orchestrate a string of
murders and frame us for it.

24:35.991 --> 24:36.990
Thank you.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.825
A themed dinner party
for brock

24:38.894 --> 24:41.295
Is a fantastic idea.

24:41.363 --> 24:43.330
Ladies, we have work to do.

25:00.849 --> 25:02.950
I know i told you
to play it cool,

25:03.018 --> 25:04.985
But now is not the time--
i need you.

25:05.054 --> 25:08.121
The gag is i know
who bought the costumes.

25:08.190 --> 25:11.992
Two of them,
but just call me back.

25:12.061 --> 25:14.027
Please, asap.

25:42.524 --> 25:44.358
I need to talk to you.

25:44.426 --> 25:45.559
Or...

25:45.628 --> 25:47.894
Should i talk to the police?

26:00.342 --> 26:04.211
Why are you here?

26:04.279 --> 26:06.647
Why didn't you go
straight to the police?

26:06.715 --> 26:08.615
My experience with the police?

26:08.684 --> 26:10.450
They couldn't find
sand on a beach.

26:10.519 --> 26:13.854
And i also wanted you
to know that i understand

26:13.922 --> 26:15.689
Your pain.

26:15.758 --> 26:17.691
What happened to your
husband was terrible.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.826
And i get why you would
want the hospital

26:19.895 --> 26:22.229
To close down forever,
but this isn't the way.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.266
Tell me where your son is,

26:26.335 --> 26:29.236
And let me help you
turn yourselves in.

26:29.304 --> 26:32.673
Too bad you weren't
working at the hospital

26:32.741 --> 26:35.509
The night they murdered
my husband.

26:35.577 --> 26:38.178
You're very kind.

26:39.815 --> 26:43.350
It was hard enough to lose
the love of my life.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.888
The heartbreak was really
just the beginning.

26:47.956 --> 26:50.090
Then there was
the rage i felt

26:50.159 --> 26:52.059
When i realized
that no one was

26:52.127 --> 26:54.327
Going to pay
for their crimes.

26:54.396 --> 26:57.264
I told the police
that my husband

26:57.332 --> 26:59.533
Would not have
checked himself out.

26:59.601 --> 27:02.502
Would not have
walked out on me.

27:02.571 --> 27:04.671
But they didn't believe me.

27:04.740 --> 27:08.875
The paperwork was all
right there, they said.

27:08.944 --> 27:13.780
Maybe he got cold feet about
being a father, they said.

27:13.849 --> 27:15.449
So i had that costume made

27:15.517 --> 27:18.218
To look like the one that
ass-jerk doctor was wearing

27:18.287 --> 27:21.021
The night they killed my bill,

27:21.090 --> 27:23.290
And then i told my brother
to go kill everyone

27:23.358 --> 27:25.425
On the anniversary
of my husband's death.

27:25.494 --> 27:27.561
Wait, "brother"?

27:29.164 --> 27:31.898
Well, he was bigger
and stronger than i was,

27:31.967 --> 27:35.669
And he also was kind
of a psychopath.

27:35.738 --> 27:38.238
He died a year
later in a fight

27:38.307 --> 27:40.407
With a roller derby team.

27:40.476 --> 27:42.275
I miss him.

27:42.344 --> 27:45.145
But knowing him,
he probably deserved it.

27:47.349 --> 27:52.152
So i vowed to never let
that hospital open again.

27:52.221 --> 27:56.022
And i raised my son
to take that same pledge.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.225
Every night before bed,

27:58.293 --> 28:00.393
We'd say our prayers
and promise that

28:00.462 --> 28:03.964
If that hospital ever
tried to open again,

28:04.032 --> 28:06.299
We would start killing people

28:06.368 --> 28:08.969
Until they just had to close.

28:09.037 --> 28:10.270
But those people had
nothing to do

28:10.339 --> 28:12.439
With what happened
to your husband.

28:12.508 --> 28:15.142
It was
innocent patients.

28:15.210 --> 28:16.943
Why are you trying
to bring logic

28:17.012 --> 28:19.246
Into this conversation?

28:19.314 --> 28:24.284
You do realize that we are
insane people, right?

28:24.353 --> 28:26.753
Who is?

28:26.822 --> 28:28.088
What's the gag?

28:28.157 --> 28:31.825
Look, i need to know...

28:33.295 --> 28:36.396
Wait, did you dim the lights?

28:36.465 --> 28:38.298
No.

28:38.367 --> 28:42.402
But i did put lorazepam
in your tea, sweetheart.

28:42.471 --> 28:46.339
You'll pass out
in just a few moments.

28:47.242 --> 28:48.642
No, but the gag can't be

28:48.710 --> 28:50.577
That i pass out.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.179
I-i need to...

29:16.296 --> 29:19.865
Why, hello there, flyboy.

29:19.933 --> 29:22.034
Look, gals, our boy brock

29:22.102 --> 29:23.502
Is home from the war.

29:23.570 --> 29:25.771
Hip-hip, hooray!

29:27.741 --> 29:29.241
Extry! Extry!
It's victory in europe.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.375
The krauts have surrendered.

29:30.444 --> 29:31.777
shh!

29:31.845 --> 29:33.378
Everyone gather 'round
the wireless.

29:33.447 --> 29:36.448
President roosevelt is about
to give a fireside chat.

29:36.517 --> 29:38.784
Hi, i'm shirley temple,
america's sweetheart.

29:38.852 --> 29:43.055
...And at
the solicitation of japan,

29:43.123 --> 29:48.260
Was still in conversation
with its government...

29:48.328 --> 29:50.629
Chanel, what...?

29:50.697 --> 29:51.797
What is going on?

29:51.865 --> 29:54.599
Oh, sit down, fella!
Take a load off.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.601
I've cooked you
a homemade meal from scratch.

29:56.670 --> 29:57.803
It'll really stick to your ribs.

29:57.871 --> 29:59.004
It's your favorite.

29:59.073 --> 30:01.907
Liver and onions,
and a tall glass of milk.

30:01.975 --> 30:03.775
But make sure you
save room for dessert.

30:03.844 --> 30:05.677
Edith lent me her ration card
to buy some sugar,

30:05.746 --> 30:07.112
So i baked you a cake.

30:07.181 --> 30:08.713
Why are you talking
like that?

30:08.782 --> 30:10.649
Eat up. Let us women
take care of you.

30:10.717 --> 30:11.850
All right, look...

30:11.919 --> 30:14.219
Stop.
I-i need you to explain

30:14.288 --> 30:16.221
What's going on right now.

30:16.290 --> 30:18.323
Well, i'm just trying
to show you how familiar i am

30:18.392 --> 30:19.858
With the culture
you grew up in.

30:19.927 --> 30:22.661
And we just want to thank you
for the sacrifices

30:22.729 --> 30:25.697
You've made being a member
of the greatest generation!

30:25.766 --> 30:27.999
All right, stop, stop.
Everyone stop, please.

30:29.203 --> 30:30.735
Number five, stop dancing.

30:36.110 --> 30:37.843
How old do you think i am?

30:37.911 --> 30:40.846
Honestly, i have no idea.

30:40.914 --> 30:41.880
You could be 40,
you could be 60.

30:41.949 --> 30:43.715
It's very hard to tell.

30:43.784 --> 30:47.185
You realize, for me to be part
of the "greatest generation,"

30:47.254 --> 30:49.888
I'd have to be, like, 80, right?

30:49.957 --> 30:53.058
Well, i'm sorry. I...

30:53.127 --> 30:54.459
It's just you were
talking about that show

30:54.528 --> 30:55.961
That took place
during world war ii,

30:56.029 --> 30:57.662
And i thought the reason you
loved it so much was because,

30:57.731 --> 30:59.865
You know, it reminded you
of your childhood.

30:59.933 --> 31:02.734
<i>M*a*s*h</i> didn't take place
in world war ii!

31:02.803 --> 31:04.669
Well...
All right, uh,

31:04.738 --> 31:06.972
Uh, look, i'm flattered
that you-you-you

31:07.040 --> 31:08.640
Did all this
for us to connect,

31:08.709 --> 31:10.709
But if i'm being honest,
i'm a little offended.

31:10.777 --> 31:12.811
You're "offended"?!

31:12.880 --> 31:14.045
A little bit, yeah.

31:14.114 --> 31:15.714
I'm gonna go home.

31:15.782 --> 31:16.748
No...

31:16.817 --> 31:18.950
Thanks.

31:19.019 --> 31:20.852
Ladies.

31:20.921 --> 31:22.387
Good-bye, dr. Holt.
When i grow up,

31:22.456 --> 31:23.722
I'm gonna run for congress!

31:23.790 --> 31:25.590
Shut up, number five!

31:30.631 --> 31:33.431
Well...

31:33.500 --> 31:34.900
You ready for round two?

31:34.968 --> 31:36.401
Mmm. Cathy.

31:36.470 --> 31:38.703
I cannot tell you

31:38.772 --> 31:40.272
How amazing it
feels to be back

31:40.340 --> 31:42.807
Together with you again.
I mean, i ca--
hmm.

31:42.876 --> 31:44.576
Can't even believe my luck.

31:44.645 --> 31:46.711
Just a few days ago,
i was a nervous wreck

31:46.780 --> 31:48.480
With a giant hairball
in his stomach.
Mm-hmm

31:48.549 --> 31:51.850
And now suddenly,
i feel like myself again.

31:51.919 --> 31:54.853
I guess you're my missing piece.

31:57.491 --> 32:00.725
Ah, wes, i must admit

32:00.794 --> 32:03.061
I'm as surprised as you are.

32:03.130 --> 32:06.798
When i walked out on you
because you were such a loser,

32:06.867 --> 32:08.867
And i couldn't stand your
daughter, i was convinced

32:08.936 --> 32:10.869
It was the right
thing to do.

32:10.938 --> 32:12.871
But then when i felt those hands

32:12.940 --> 32:14.239
On this body again,

32:14.308 --> 32:16.041
I was like,
"cathy, you are a moron."

32:16.109 --> 32:17.209
Mmm.

32:17.277 --> 32:20.745
This is the guy you

32:20.814 --> 32:22.414
Should be banging.
Oh.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.349
Oh, my god, look out!

32:42.436 --> 32:44.469
i have an idea.

32:44.538 --> 32:46.705
Is that body spray?
What, are you 12?!

32:46.773 --> 32:48.607
On three, you kick.
Oh.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.775
One, two, three.

32:53.046 --> 32:54.546
Let's go!
Let's go!

32:54.615 --> 32:56.448
Let's go.
What are you
talking about?!

32:56.516 --> 32:58.483
Let's stay and fight.
I just had surgery.

32:58.552 --> 33:00.318
I am not about
to pop my stitches.

33:08.762 --> 33:11.296
Damn it.

33:11.365 --> 33:12.631
Someone doesn't
like the fact

33:12.699 --> 33:14.766
That you and i
are back together.

33:14.835 --> 33:16.501
Who?

33:16.570 --> 33:19.504
Dr. Brock holt,
that's who.

33:31.118 --> 33:33.485
Oh, no.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.086
Oh, no.

33:35.155 --> 33:36.721
Not again.

33:36.790 --> 33:39.357
Help me!

33:41.161 --> 33:43.728
Help me! Help me!

33:51.029 --> 33:52.862
Hi.

33:52.931 --> 33:54.964
Can we talk?

34:03.007 --> 34:06.375
I've been thinking about
the party that you threw me,

34:06.444 --> 34:09.745
And-and how you thought
that maybe i was in my 80s.

34:09.814 --> 34:10.913
Brock, i'm sorry
if i offended you.

34:10.982 --> 34:12.548
I was just--
oh, let me finish.

34:12.617 --> 34:13.716
And i was offended

34:13.785 --> 34:16.752
And actually afraid, really,

34:16.821 --> 34:20.356
For the future
of our country, but...

34:20.425 --> 34:23.960
The more i thought about it, the
more i realize how sweet it was.

34:24.028 --> 34:26.028
I mean, you were really
trying to make a connection,

34:26.097 --> 34:27.797
And you put in all
that effort to...
Yeah.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.866
To bridge our age gap and...

34:29.934 --> 34:34.403
Well, i'll tell you,
i've come to a decision.

34:34.472 --> 34:37.640
Oh, my god, you're proposing.
You're proposing.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.408
What? Propo--?
Oh, because of the knee?

34:39.477 --> 34:41.611
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I have a...

34:41.679 --> 34:43.813
I have a bum knee, and sometimes
if i sit in the same

34:43.882 --> 34:46.182
Position too long, it kind of
locks out, so i have to,

34:46.251 --> 34:48.851
Ooh, do knee bends
and stretch.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.120
Want to stretch it out. Like, do
like, like what i just did.

34:51.189 --> 34:52.622
It's fine now...

34:52.690 --> 34:54.357
I get it!

34:57.128 --> 34:59.795
But i do want to commit to you.

35:00.865 --> 35:03.132
I want you
to commit to me.

35:03.201 --> 35:06.035
I want us to commit
to each other for real.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.803
i want you, chanel.

35:07.872 --> 35:10.439
I want you
and no one else.

35:10.508 --> 35:13.776
Yes! Yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes!

35:14.979 --> 35:15.845
Ow.
Brockie.

35:15.914 --> 35:19.282
Chanela.
I knew it.

35:19.350 --> 35:21.417
<i> Let me get this</i>
<i>straight-- you're back</i>

35:21.486 --> 35:22.652
Together with chanel,
but you want

35:22.720 --> 35:24.020
To have an affair with me?

35:24.088 --> 35:25.788
Yes, exactly,
and not a one-time thing.

35:25.857 --> 35:26.989
I want a long-term affair.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.591
Something that lasts years.

35:28.660 --> 35:29.992
i'm sorry.

35:30.061 --> 35:31.861
I am just trying
to wrap my head around this.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.429
Well, i like

35:33.498 --> 35:35.164
Dating chanel.
I mean, sort of.

35:35.233 --> 35:37.433
We get back together,
she makes me do

35:37.502 --> 35:39.869
A facebook live announcement
and a reddit ama

35:39.938 --> 35:42.205
To all her followers, which
are a bunch of nutters,

35:42.273 --> 35:43.873
Let me tell you this much.

35:43.942 --> 35:46.709
And i don't even know
if she likes dating me.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.078
I mean, i know she likes
saying that she dates me, but

35:49.147 --> 35:50.646
If i try to craft a sentence

35:50.715 --> 35:52.415
That's longer than four
or five words, by the time

35:52.483 --> 35:54.450
I get to the end, she's back
checking her phone again.

35:54.519 --> 35:56.819
So why not break up with her?
I thought of that.

35:56.888 --> 35:59.922
but then the thought
occurred to me...

35:59.991 --> 36:02.858
It's a perfect cover for us.

36:02.927 --> 36:04.093
See,

36:04.162 --> 36:06.662
You keep dating,
uh-- what's his name?

36:06.731 --> 36:07.930
Wes.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.799
Wes. It's more sexy
and european if you do.

36:09.867 --> 36:11.867
And if he thinks that
chanel and i are together,

36:11.936 --> 36:13.903
Then there's no
way he'll suspect

36:13.972 --> 36:15.972
That the two of us are having
something on the side, see?

36:16.040 --> 36:20.476
So... What do i get out of it?

36:20.545 --> 36:22.011
What do you...?

36:22.080 --> 36:24.513
Are you seriously asking me
that question?

36:24.582 --> 36:27.850
I think it's
pretty obvious, don't you?

36:30.421 --> 36:31.420
Double the pounding.

36:31.489 --> 36:33.356
Exactly.
Hmm.

36:33.424 --> 36:35.057
Double the pounding.

36:35.126 --> 36:37.526
Twice the amount
of ruggedly-handsome men

36:37.595 --> 36:40.863
Of a certain age just
dying for a taste.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.933
Doesn't that
sound tempting?

36:44.002 --> 36:45.868
And, uh... Aah!
What's his name again?

36:45.937 --> 36:47.703
Wes.
Wes.

36:47.772 --> 36:49.572
Wes must be pushing
50 by now, right?

36:49.641 --> 36:51.140
And i guarantee

36:51.209 --> 36:53.342
There's gonna be a night
or two, try as he might,

36:53.411 --> 36:55.578
Hmm.
That he just can't perform.

36:55.647 --> 36:59.982
And that's just when you might
get an emergency call saying

37:00.051 --> 37:02.218
"we need you at the office,
dean munsch, right away."

37:02.287 --> 37:03.753
Yeah.

37:03.821 --> 37:05.921
All right.

37:05.990 --> 37:08.524
I think i'm getting one
of those calls.

37:10.161 --> 37:13.195
It's coming in
right about now.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.143
Right. Come on, baby.
You got this.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.746
Hour and a half.
Just easy.

37:30.815 --> 37:32.648
You can do this.
Chamberlain, you can do this!

37:32.717 --> 37:35.117
It's nothing. Be strong.
Baby, be strong.

37:35.186 --> 37:36.919
And he's at the free throw line.

37:36.988 --> 37:39.989
Bong. Here we go.
He's hot, lady.

37:40.058 --> 37:42.258
Kobe!

37:42.327 --> 37:44.460
Hey!

37:44.529 --> 37:47.430
Shaq.

38:00.878 --> 38:03.479
Oh.

38:03.548 --> 38:07.783
Ew.

38:07.852 --> 38:10.820
Ugh, chainsaw...?

38:10.888 --> 38:12.822
What? No...

38:29.390 --> 38:31.490
I'm chamberlain.
I work at the hospital.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.025
Hey, i was doing
some dance cardio,

38:33.094 --> 38:34.960
Trying to get back into shape
post-surgery.

38:35.029 --> 38:36.829
Yeah, great thinking.
Hey, do you mind if i come in?

38:36.898 --> 38:38.497
I got to talk to you
about something.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.633
Yeah, come on in.

38:40.702 --> 38:43.135
Hey, do you want
a juice, huh?
Nah.

38:43.204 --> 38:45.971
Have a ketchup
sandwich or something?

38:46.040 --> 38:48.107
I don't drink juice.
Hey, i got a question.

38:48.176 --> 38:50.343
Um, i was going, you know,
gathering all the medical waste

38:50.411 --> 38:53.679
To dump into the swamp, and
i found some really weird stuff

38:53.748 --> 38:55.448
In your giant-ass hairball.

38:55.516 --> 38:57.783
Like suspicious stuff.

38:59.554 --> 39:02.154
Hey, have any of the chanels
or zayday told you anything

39:02.223 --> 39:03.789
About my daughter grace?

39:03.858 --> 39:05.725
Well, they just said
she was really nice,

39:05.793 --> 39:07.193
And she always thought
she was right.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.995
Oh, and chanel said that
her hair was freakishly big,

39:10.064 --> 39:12.298
Like, you know, the dude
from<i> nightmare before christmas.</i>

39:12.367 --> 39:14.533
Or like one of those
macy day parade floats.

39:14.602 --> 39:16.302
I figured
she was exaggerating.

39:16.371 --> 39:19.905
She's a ray of sunshine
is what she is.

39:19.974 --> 39:22.074
Too sweet for this world.

39:22.143 --> 39:26.746
But she was... She was on her
way to doing something great,

39:26.814 --> 39:28.914
Like working for elizabeth
warren or being a,

39:28.983 --> 39:31.417
An adorable, yet completely
not ironic hat model.

39:31.486 --> 39:32.752
Hmm.

39:32.820 --> 39:34.954
Until the chanels came along.

39:36.491 --> 39:40.359
You know, she seemed...
She seemed fine, you know,

39:40.428 --> 39:42.228
With all the craziness
that was going on

39:42.296 --> 39:43.929
At wallace
university, the,

39:43.998 --> 39:46.532
The hazings
and all the murders.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.534
And she was just covering.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.737
It got to her deeply.

39:51.806 --> 39:55.941
Yeah, that's when the signs
of the trauma started to show,

39:56.010 --> 39:58.944
And she stopped sharing
all the boring details

39:59.013 --> 40:01.313
Of her life with me.

40:01.382 --> 40:05.951
During that katy perry,
taylor swift feud,

40:06.020 --> 40:07.987
She sided with katy.

40:08.055 --> 40:09.355
No.
Yeah.

40:09.424 --> 40:12.792
And no matter how many hats
i bought her,

40:12.860 --> 40:15.861
No matter how cute
and whimsical they were,

40:15.930 --> 40:17.363
She refused to wear any.

40:17.432 --> 40:20.332
She was not the same person.
She was changed.

40:20.401 --> 40:24.103
All because of those chanels.

40:24.172 --> 40:26.372
So is that why
you start eating hair?

40:26.441 --> 40:28.441
Is that her hair in there
with your hair?
Listen,

40:28.509 --> 40:31.777
When i heard that dean munsch
was starting that hospital,

40:31.846 --> 40:33.946
And all the chanels were gonna
be working there, i thought,

40:34.015 --> 40:36.348
That doesn't seem fair.

40:36.417 --> 40:39.051
Not when my daughter was locked
up in a mental institution,

40:39.120 --> 40:42.822
Because of what they did to her.

40:42.890 --> 40:46.492
Wait. Hold up, i thought
you said she went to stanford.

40:46.561 --> 40:50.863
Stanford mental asylum.

40:50.932 --> 40:53.632
You have to score
in the 99th percentile

40:53.701 --> 40:55.000
In your sats just to get in.

40:55.069 --> 40:57.503
Yeah, i know about that.
Yeah.

40:57.572 --> 41:00.272
I couldn't allow them
to get away with it.

41:02.043 --> 41:05.811
How come... How come
they get to become doctors

41:05.880 --> 41:07.813
When my little grace
gets locked up?

41:07.882 --> 41:10.749
And then once that green meanie
started killing people,

41:10.818 --> 41:13.352
I thought, "well,

41:13.421 --> 41:16.889
"what better way to get to them
without anyone suspecting me?

41:16.958 --> 41:19.325
"i could take the
chanels out, and everyone

41:19.393 --> 41:21.727
Would just suspect
the other green meanie."

41:21.796 --> 41:25.231
So why did you start
eating all that hair?

41:25.299 --> 41:27.533
I went to the hair salon

41:27.602 --> 41:30.436
And paid them
for the droppings on the floor.

41:30.505 --> 41:33.072
And then i went home...
And i pounded them.

41:33.140 --> 41:35.875
I had to get pretty drunk
in order to do that,

41:35.943 --> 41:38.511
So, clearly, i accidentally ate
a bunch of other stuff

41:38.579 --> 41:40.112
That was just laying
around the table.

41:40.181 --> 41:42.448
Why, dude?

41:42.517 --> 41:45.050
Because now i'm in.

41:45.119 --> 41:49.321
Now i can move in
and out of the hospital freely.

41:49.390 --> 41:55.027
Which means that i can finally
get my revenge on the chanels.

41:55.096 --> 41:57.062
Now, unfortunately,

41:57.131 --> 42:00.499
Now that you have heard
all of this,

42:00.568 --> 42:04.036
I can't let you leave.

42:04.105 --> 42:06.238
Actually, i got
to make a phone call.

42:06.307 --> 42:08.007
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

42:10.311 --> 42:13.679
I'm just kidding, man.

42:13.748 --> 42:15.714
That was pretty good,
though, wasn't it?
Yeah, that was...

42:15.783 --> 42:18.584
Come here, man.
Let's get a hug.

42:25.059 --> 42:27.159
There.

42:27.228 --> 42:30.095
Oh.
Shh.

42:30.164 --> 42:31.964
Shh...

42:47.848 --> 42:50.282
I'm at jane hollis'
house! Come quickly!

42:50.351 --> 42:53.052
We were right.
She is the mother of the killer.

42:53.120 --> 42:54.653
Call me back.

43:01.896 --> 43:04.129
