00:01.748 --> 00:04.216
<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:04.284 --> 00:06.411
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:06.486 --> 00:08.920
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:09.356 --> 00:11.153
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:13.627 --> 00:15.390
The nicks are
a 16th of an inch deep,

00:15.462 --> 00:18.295
but I can't determine
the type of projectile.

00:18.965 --> 00:22.457
Projectile, like gunshots from
the park across the street?

00:22.536 --> 00:25.198
Projectile is a generic term, Mr. Martz.

00:25.939 --> 00:27.372
Could it be a defect in the glass?

00:27.441 --> 00:29.341
I use that glass
in all my buildings.

00:29.943 --> 00:31.808
If it'll make you
feel better, Mr. Martz,

00:31.878 --> 00:34.711
we'll schedule an extra
night patrol in the park.

00:42.823 --> 00:46.088
Anne Marie, from now on, keep
Jeremy away from those windows.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074

00:55.969 --> 00:57.732
Well, doesn't it
scrape off?

00:57.804 --> 00:59.294
It'll just
come back.

00:59.639 --> 01:01.106
What is it?

01:03.043 --> 01:04.510
The beginning
of the end.

01:28.602 --> 01:30.797
It's your
favorite channel, huh?

01:32.906 --> 01:35.431
They are really
feeling the heat now.

01:39.946 --> 01:43.211
Jay, is it me, or is that
supposed to fog up like that?

01:44.050 --> 01:45.142
What's that?

02:05.539 --> 02:07.473
Anne Marie, you're supposed
to keep an eye on Jeremy.

02:07.541 --> 02:08.872
I'm sorry.

02:10.943 --> 02:12.809
I must have
looked like an idiot.

02:12.879 --> 02:14.346
When the steam started
coming out of the ground,

02:14.414 --> 02:16.041
I thought the whole place
was going to blow up.

02:16.116 --> 02:19.745
All right, everyone, take
a seat. Let's get started.

02:28.428 --> 02:30.896
I know, I'm disappointed, too, but...

02:31.865 --> 02:33.856
No, no, that's still an option.

02:38.071 --> 02:39.971
Yeah,
thanks for calling.

03:47.007 --> 03:49.032
They were coming upriver
when something hit the prop.

03:49.109 --> 03:51.009
The owner, Mr. Paulson,
was driving the boat.

03:51.077 --> 03:52.669
Deckhands say
he's a 40- proof sailor.

03:52.746 --> 03:54.043
You do
a Breathalyzer?

03:54.114 --> 03:56.207
He locked himself
in his lawyer's car.

03:56.283 --> 03:57.807
He's got some pull in
the Commissioner's office.

03:57.884 --> 04:00.409
That's why we're here. You tell
Mr. Paulson he doesn't submit

04:00.487 --> 04:02.045
to a Breathalyzer
in 10 minutes,

04:02.122 --> 04:04.454
we'll put him where
his pull doesn't reach.

04:06.192 --> 04:08.786
Looks like he went
headfirst into the propeller.

04:09.763 --> 04:12.095
What's he wearing,
a sailing suit?

04:12.165 --> 04:14.725
No, the collar's too short.
Looks like a jogging suit.

04:15.769 --> 04:17.862
See this injury here,
near the spine?

04:18.004 --> 04:20.096
It's more narrow
than the others.

04:20.173 --> 04:24.269
Doesn't look like it's from
a propeller, and it's deep.

04:24.844 --> 04:27.244
Now if that hit
the renal artery,

04:28.315 --> 04:30.840
he was dead before
he was in the water.

04:31.751 --> 04:35.084
An oblique incision
at 25 degrees.

04:35.155 --> 04:37.316
That's the angle
the blade went in.

04:39.092 --> 04:42.687
An adjustable blade?
Maybe a power saw?

04:44.631 --> 04:46.997
Any estimate on how long
he was in the water?

04:47.067 --> 04:49.627
No lividity,
so say about an hour.

04:49.703 --> 04:54.402
So, bumped into
the boat about here.

04:54.574 --> 04:58.908
Now the Hudson flows around four
clicks an hour this time of year.

04:58.979 --> 05:01.948
Four kilometers would put
him going in off Chelsea.

05:02.649 --> 05:04.276
The leuko lit up
around this bench.

05:04.417 --> 05:06.044
That's all we need.
Thanks.

05:15.095 --> 05:16.585
Optical glass.

05:17.697 --> 05:20.165
Curvature's too
extreme for glasses.

05:21.801 --> 05:23.291
Might be a lens
from a binocular.

05:23.370 --> 05:26.931
Looks like blood on it. Might
belong to the victim or the perp.

05:27.007 --> 05:29.498
Maybe the guy
liked to watch boats.

05:30.577 --> 05:33.205
There's not much
to see here at night.

05:34.247 --> 05:36.442
Front row seats
for a Peeping Tom.

05:36.516 --> 05:39.144
Maybe their doorman's
seen this guy before.

05:43.156 --> 05:46.557
Oh, God. It's Jay.

05:47.761 --> 05:50.355
I called everywhere last
night looking for him.

05:54.534 --> 05:56.058
You own binoculars?

05:56.136 --> 05:59.970
Yeah, that's why
we moved here.

06:00.974 --> 06:03.272
Jay loved the view.

06:04.044 --> 06:09.038
There's a smudge
on the window.

06:10.984 --> 06:13.009
It's on
the balcony side.

06:16.856 --> 06:20.553
Your husband spent a lot of time
out there looking at the view, huh?

06:21.795 --> 06:23.057
I guess.

06:26.599 --> 06:29.932
Any idea why he would have taken
the binoculars with him last night?

06:31.838 --> 06:33.499
I can't imagine.

06:38.445 --> 06:40.208
Excuse me,
I have to take this.

06:42.849 --> 06:45.147
Maybe he was admiring
his building.

06:46.286 --> 06:48.254
<i>According to
Architecture Now,</i>

06:48.321 --> 06:50.915
"It's a wonder
of postmodern design. "

06:51.324 --> 06:54.418
Peerson arranged for them to
do a photo shoot here next week.

06:56.596 --> 06:58.029
Bars on the screen.

06:59.733 --> 07:01.792
Looks like
they're burned in.

07:01.935 --> 07:05.769
Somebody left the television on
the same channel for too long.

07:09.175 --> 07:11.302
Poor man's
reality TV.

07:11.678 --> 07:13.373
I don't know about
muggers in the park,

07:13.446 --> 07:17.576
but it looks like Peerson's more worried
about the people in his own building.

07:18.284 --> 07:20.650
Nobody moves in this
building without us seeing it.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.187
You remember anybody
coming through here

07:22.255 --> 07:25.782
either just before or after
Mr. Peerson went out last night?

07:25.859 --> 07:28.293
Well, just Mrs. Fisher
and her son about 9:15.

07:28.361 --> 07:30.886
They had a car service take
them out to the Hamptons.

07:30.964 --> 07:35.901
This is nice. This woodwork
here, you cut it here to fit?

07:35.969 --> 07:38.164
Yup. They finished it two days ago.

07:38.471 --> 07:39.699
Finally.

07:39.773 --> 07:43.732
I don't have my protractor, but this
looks like a 25-degree angle to me.

07:45.145 --> 07:46.442
Just seal it.

07:48.114 --> 07:49.741
We'll deal with the
leaks as we find them.

07:49.816 --> 07:52.478
Leaks?
From steam pipes?

07:52.819 --> 07:54.548
Just that the lobby floor is heated.

07:54.621 --> 07:55.679
It's supposed
to be.

07:55.755 --> 07:58.588
Fancy. We're wondering
who put up that woodwork.

07:58.958 --> 08:00.926
Well, that'd be me.

08:00.994 --> 08:04.828
Those 25-degree angles,
you cut those with a saw?

08:05.498 --> 08:06.726
Yeah. A small
circular saw.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.062
Why are you asking?

08:09.302 --> 08:12.294
We're doing a makeover on
our squad room. And you are?

08:12.372 --> 08:14.636
Bernie Moreno.
I built this building.

08:15.608 --> 08:17.235
You here because
of Jay Peerson?

08:17.310 --> 08:19.073
Good guess.
You knew him well?

08:19.312 --> 08:20.677
He was president
of the condo board.

08:20.747 --> 08:23.079
We were working together
to get the building finished.

08:23.149 --> 08:25.777
You still have that
circular saw here?

08:30.757 --> 08:32.349
Something wrong, Bob?

08:32.424 --> 08:34.620
Well, my saw is gone.

08:35.227 --> 08:36.592
I put it in there
day before yesterday.

08:36.663 --> 08:38.654
You don't keep
this thing locked?

08:38.731 --> 08:40.357
Not all the time, no.

08:41.301 --> 08:44.566
Last time you used the saw,
was that on the woodwork?

08:44.637 --> 08:47.629
That's right. That's right.
I finished it two days ago.

08:48.608 --> 08:51.702
The builder, Mr. Moreno, he
was all over us to get it done.

08:51.811 --> 08:55.303
All this caulking.
A lot more leaks.

08:56.282 --> 08:58.375
Yeah. From the roof
and the windows.

08:58.451 --> 09:02.285
Mr. Moreno not in a
hurry to get them fixed?

09:02.355 --> 09:06.451
Leaks don't show up in a photo
spread. Not like woodwork in a lobby.

09:06.526 --> 09:07.788
No.

09:07.861 --> 09:13.060
Is that what Mr. Moreno was worried
about, the photo shoot next week?

09:13.132 --> 09:16.158
All I know is he had us
working double shifts.

09:16.236 --> 09:19.171
And then, yesterday...
Yesterday,

09:19.239 --> 09:21.207
he had us go back
to regular shifts.

09:21.341 --> 09:22.933
The pressure was off.

09:23.977 --> 09:26.445
He said the homeowners
canceled the photo shoot.

09:27.580 --> 09:29.707
And then somebody
canceled Jay Peerson.

09:29.782 --> 09:32.979
Sounds like the homeowners were
the ones feeling the pressure.

09:33.052 --> 09:37.079
Okay, hope she got it.
You never know with her.

09:38.591 --> 09:39.649
Fred.

09:40.326 --> 09:43.295
Darla, anything we can
do, you let us know.

09:43.529 --> 09:45.520
Thank you.

09:45.598 --> 09:50.262
I have calls to return still,
but please stay. Help yourselves.

09:52.405 --> 09:53.872
Maybe you should
call Anne Marie.

09:53.940 --> 09:55.805
I'm never sure she gets my messages.

09:57.176 --> 09:58.700
She got this one.

10:00.713 --> 10:02.374
You send her
out for milk,

10:02.448 --> 10:04.177
she comes back
with motor oil.

10:05.585 --> 10:09.146
Things are different
now, Victor.

10:09.222 --> 10:11.952
I hope you'll see
things our way.

10:24.203 --> 10:26.694
Moreno's had a few beefs
with the Building Department.

10:26.773 --> 10:28.468
And then there's this.
Two weeks ago,

10:28.541 --> 10:30.406
local precinct
investigated reports

10:30.476 --> 10:32.569
of gunshots hitting the River Tower.

10:32.645 --> 10:35.808
Turns out it was just falling
debris hitting some windows.

10:35.882 --> 10:36.871
Talk about
your dream house.

10:36.950 --> 10:38.679
Doesn't sound like anyone's
getting a good night's sleep.

10:41.087 --> 10:42.748
Careful with that.

10:44.190 --> 10:45.953
Same model as
the murder weapon.

10:46.059 --> 10:49.460
It's light, maneuverable,
it's got a blade

10:49.529 --> 10:52.123
that can cut through metal and bone.

10:52.198 --> 10:54.257
Not the obvious choice
to kill someone.

10:54.367 --> 10:57.427
Cover the bases. Get alibis
from everyone in the building.

10:57.503 --> 10:59.130
We know what one of
his neighbors was doing.

10:59.205 --> 11:00.467
A few minutes
before he was killed,

11:00.540 --> 11:04.101
Peerson got a call from a
Victor Garros on the third floor.

11:05.011 --> 11:07.502
We were commiserating.

11:07.580 --> 11:09.377
Jay and I never thought
being on a condo board

11:09.449 --> 11:11.883
would take over
our entire lives.

11:11.951 --> 11:14.818
You were at the meeting for
the vote on the photo shoot?

11:14.887 --> 11:17.981
Yes, I'm the secretary.
I record the minutes.

11:19.258 --> 11:23.388
Now, the photo shoot was putting
a lot of pressure on Bernie Moreno.

11:24.564 --> 11:26.691
Why do you suppose
it was voted down?

11:28.701 --> 11:31.636
Mr. Garros, is it possible
some members of the board

11:31.704 --> 11:33.729
were threatened
by Moreno?

11:33.806 --> 11:35.000
I don't know
about that.

11:35.074 --> 11:37.235
Jay wanted
to sue Moreno,

11:37.310 --> 11:40.677
and some of the others were afraid
that he would just, you know,

11:40.747 --> 11:41.873
walk away
from the job.

11:41.948 --> 11:44.212
Well, he's practically walked away now.

11:44.283 --> 11:45.648
The heating
doesn't work...

11:45.718 --> 11:47.185
What is this
here?

11:48.254 --> 11:50.222
A floating wall.

11:50.523 --> 11:54.050
It's another thing Moreno
hasn't quite gotten around to.

11:54.327 --> 11:57.023
The other people, how do
they plan to deal with Moreno?

11:57.096 --> 11:59.326
They want to pay him
extra to finish the job

11:59.399 --> 12:02.698
by almost tripling our
maintenance fee to $8,000 a month.

12:03.803 --> 12:05.634
These people
are nuts.

12:05.705 --> 12:09.038
Yeah, Maureen doesn't really
understand about New York real estate.

12:09.108 --> 12:11.269
You're not from here?

12:11.344 --> 12:13.608
No, I'm from Brewster.

12:13.813 --> 12:16.213
We had a
bed-and-breakfast there.

12:17.950 --> 12:20.885
But Victor grew up
in the city, so...

12:21.587 --> 12:25.489
Now the group that wants to pay
off Moreno, who speaks for them?

12:25.558 --> 12:28.049
Fred Martz.
He's in the penthouse.

12:28.828 --> 12:31.797
Martz? He called in
the gunshot report.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.068
I haven't been threatened.
Where did you get that idea?

12:36.135 --> 12:39.263
Well, for instance,
instead of suing Moreno,

12:39.338 --> 12:43.604
you want to pay him extra to finish
work he's already been paid to do.

12:44.310 --> 12:47.108
First of all,
I don't scare that easy.

12:47.180 --> 12:51.844
Well, maybe Moreno found
another way to get you back.

12:51.918 --> 12:53.180
You know,

12:54.587 --> 12:55.884
like this wall.

12:55.955 --> 12:58.082
Is this what you call
a floating wall?

12:58.191 --> 13:00.785
Yes. It's bronze and aluminum.

13:00.860 --> 13:05.126
We almost saw another one,
but Moreno hadn't built it yet.

13:05.231 --> 13:06.892
You know, I'm willing to
bet that this is the only one

13:06.966 --> 13:08.661
that he actually
did finish.

13:08.801 --> 13:12.100
Mr. Martz, your mail
is being forwarded

13:12.171 --> 13:14.662
from four
different addresses.

13:15.775 --> 13:18.039
What's that called when
somebody buys a place

13:18.111 --> 13:19.874
and lives in it for a
year and then sells it?

13:19.946 --> 13:21.174
Yeah, yeah, flipping.

13:21.247 --> 13:24.478
Right, flipping. You're going
to flip this place, aren't you?

13:24.550 --> 13:27.644
Is that why you don't want
publicity from a lawsuit?

13:27.720 --> 13:29.381
If word got out this place was a dud,

13:29.455 --> 13:31.582
the $2,000 a square foot you paid

13:31.657 --> 13:35.093
would be worth, what, half? A third?

13:36.262 --> 13:38.025
Did you notice that when
they were building this

13:38.097 --> 13:39.724
that they used
a little saw?

13:39.799 --> 13:44.099
You know, the same kind of
saw they used to kill Jay with?

13:44.637 --> 13:45.831
You're accusing me?

13:45.905 --> 13:49.272
Just for drill, where were you
around 9:00 the night he was killed?

13:49.342 --> 13:53.301
I was outside in front
of the garage with Moreno.

13:53.379 --> 13:58.112
Oh, so your alibi's our other
suspect. That's not terrific for you.

13:58.184 --> 14:01.153
For God's sake,
I didn't kill Jay.

14:01.220 --> 14:04.519
When I was finished with
Moreno, I came back up here.

14:05.558 --> 14:08.254
I'm sorry,
I was at a yoga class.

14:08.861 --> 14:10.226
And Moreno?

14:10.296 --> 14:13.595
He said he had to fix the automatic
gate in front of the garage.

14:15.635 --> 14:17.466
He skinned his knee.

14:17.537 --> 14:19.004
It's okay, sweetie,
Mommy's here.

14:22.642 --> 14:24.041
There we go.

14:24.110 --> 14:26.408
I have said everything to you I'm
going to say without my lawyer.

14:26.479 --> 14:27.878
I would like you to leave.

14:33.619 --> 14:36.816
Maybe the super can tell us if
Moreno actually fixed that gate.

14:36.889 --> 14:38.288
That smudge,

14:39.659 --> 14:43.026
it's the same height as it
was at the Peersons' place.

14:44.697 --> 14:46.995
Anybody besides Moreno might
have worked on the gate?

14:47.066 --> 14:49.398
No. I told him we were
having problems with it.

14:49.468 --> 14:51.868
His crew had already gone.
He said he'd fix it himself.

14:51.938 --> 14:54.372
That takes him
out of the running.

14:56.275 --> 14:59.574
8A? That's the Martzes' space, isn't it?

14:59.979 --> 15:01.606
Mrs. Martz.

15:10.656 --> 15:12.021
When did this drip start?

15:12.258 --> 15:13.520
Yesterday.

15:13.593 --> 15:17.222
We moved her to another spot
until we can get it fixed.

15:19.732 --> 15:21.495
The new space,
can we see it?

15:21.567 --> 15:23.432
Well, yeah.
It's back here.

15:24.370 --> 15:26.702
It's the only space
we have open.

15:30.009 --> 15:32.068
There's no security camera back here.

15:34.146 --> 15:35.443
Where's that door
lead to?

15:35.514 --> 15:39.610
It's the service corridor to the
stairwell. Only employees have keys.

15:39.685 --> 15:42.119
I'd be worried
parking back here.

15:43.189 --> 15:45.282
That drip down there, do
you know how it started?

15:45.358 --> 15:47.349
Well, it looks like a pipe
just got knocked loose.

15:47.426 --> 15:48.757
Well, we're gonna need
you to send a notice

15:48.828 --> 15:51.524
to the tenants about
that pipe getting fixed.

15:54.233 --> 15:56.201
Hillary Martz?

15:56.269 --> 15:58.669
We might not know the why,
but at least we know the how.

15:59.772 --> 16:01.967
Hillary,
after tomorrow night,

16:02.041 --> 16:04.737
you'll be able to park
back in your old spot.

16:06.045 --> 16:07.478
They're fixing the pipes.

16:07.947 --> 16:09.380
That was quick.

16:09.915 --> 16:13.646
Look at that. That's what we paid for.

16:19.191 --> 16:21.022
Anne Marie,
what's the matter?

16:27.667 --> 16:30.158
Fred. Fred!

16:30.736 --> 16:32.397
Hillary, get a mop.

16:32.471 --> 16:36.771
I can't believe this. Those
idiots didn't seal the windows.

16:52.158 --> 16:53.523
Drop it! Drop it!

16:54.694 --> 16:55.922
Drop it!

17:00.066 --> 17:03.058
God told me.
God told me to do it.

17:08.708 --> 17:12.234
My client's not in a position to
decide what's in her best interest.

17:12.310 --> 17:13.868
She was arrested
trying to kill someone

17:13.945 --> 17:15.470
she thought
was Hillary Martz.

17:15.548 --> 17:17.880
An explanation
can only help her.

17:19.318 --> 17:21.548
Anne Marie, you don't seem very happy.

17:21.619 --> 17:26.557
People are usually happy they are
chosen by God for a special purpose.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.160
Was it difficult
for you to obey him?

17:31.897 --> 17:34.195
Yes, but I had to.

17:35.034 --> 17:36.558
He showed me
the door in the garage

17:36.635 --> 17:38.364
and he put the key
in my pocket.

17:39.672 --> 17:43.199
He showed you how?
In a dream?

17:43.275 --> 17:47.075
No, he just showed me. He
showed me they were sinners.

17:48.247 --> 17:52.274
I saw him touch her while
everybody was at the apartment.

17:52.351 --> 17:56.481
You saw Mrs. Martz and Mr.
Peerson? They were having an affair?

17:56.555 --> 17:58.420
God told me
they were.

17:59.492 --> 18:04.293
Does he speak to you? You
hear voices? His voice?

18:05.097 --> 18:09.625
No. He has a special way
of telling me things.

18:12.571 --> 18:14.334
How do you know
it's God?

18:14.407 --> 18:16.432
Because he tells me
things only God knows

18:16.509 --> 18:19.239
about my prayers
and other things,

18:19.712 --> 18:22.681
like how Ms. Martz eats in
secret and makes herself sick.

18:24.850 --> 18:27.148
Anne Marie, the world
is full of sinners.

18:29.555 --> 18:32.581
Why would God ask you
to punish these two?

18:32.658 --> 18:35.821
He said their sin was bringing
a plague on the building.

18:35.895 --> 18:37.260
A plague?

18:37.329 --> 18:39.627
You mean the problems
with the construction?

18:39.698 --> 18:42.997
The windows break, the
cement turns to white powder.

18:43.068 --> 18:44.558
It's all signs.

18:44.703 --> 18:46.193
Of what?

18:46.272 --> 18:49.400
The prophecy.
Mark 13.

18:50.676 --> 18:54.703
Mark 13. "Jesus came out of the temple.

18:54.780 --> 18:59.012
"His disciple said to him, 'Master,
see what buildings are here. '

18:59.084 --> 19:02.542
"And Jesus answered, 'Seest
thou these great buildings?

19:02.621 --> 19:05.385
"'There shall not be left
one stone upon another

19:05.458 --> 19:07.392
"'that shall not
be thrown down. "'

19:07.460 --> 19:08.984
It happened before.

19:10.496 --> 19:14.489
Three years ago. The Devil's
Chimney. I saw it on TV.

19:14.567 --> 19:16.364
People were
falling from the sky.

19:18.604 --> 19:22.267
And God told me that it would
happen again if I did not obey.

19:29.415 --> 19:33.818
An affair? I don't know where
Anne Marie got that idea.

19:33.886 --> 19:37.287
She said Mr. Peerson touched
you during a homeowners meeting.

19:37.957 --> 19:40.790
We were both in the exercise
room when the steam pipe blew.

19:41.627 --> 19:43.458
He just put his hand
on my shoulder.

19:44.430 --> 19:46.330
Anne Marie's making
this whole thing up.

19:47.533 --> 19:51.367
Here you go. Are you
bulimic, Mrs. Martz?

19:53.038 --> 19:54.335
Of course not.

19:54.406 --> 19:55.771
Because
Anne Marie,

19:55.841 --> 19:58.674
she said that she was told
by God that you, you know,

19:58.744 --> 20:02.407
binge in secret, and then
you... How would she know that?

20:04.250 --> 20:07.219
Is that what you're thinking?
Maybe she saw you or...

20:07.286 --> 20:08.719
It's impossible.

20:09.822 --> 20:11.756
I always make sure
no one's home.

20:13.726 --> 20:16.320
Thank you for all your help, Mrs. Martz.

20:16.629 --> 20:18.790
The officer will show you downstairs.

20:24.003 --> 20:26.836
So, a fanatic?

20:27.373 --> 20:30.433
I think she's a reasonably
functioning person

20:30.509 --> 20:32.875
who's convinced that
she was contacted by God.

20:32.945 --> 20:35.106
Now, her conviction
is informed by

20:35.180 --> 20:39.514
a traumatic experience.

20:42.021 --> 20:44.353
Devil's Chimney.
World Trade Center.

20:44.456 --> 20:46.356
Now she thinks
that she was chosen

20:46.425 --> 20:48.325
to stop it
from happening again.

20:48.394 --> 20:51.557
The key to that door didn't
just materialize in her pocket.

20:51.630 --> 20:53.757
Actually, we traced it back
to the maintenance office.

20:53.832 --> 20:58.201
And Anne Marie's DNA matched the
smudge on Jay Peerson's window.

20:58.270 --> 21:00.397
She was watching him
from his own balcony?

21:00.472 --> 21:03.202
God tells her things,
but she doesn't hear voices.

21:03.275 --> 21:05.800
These are
her personal effects.

21:07.413 --> 21:09.643
Now there's dozens
of messages

21:11.483 --> 21:14.611
from the Martzes
about Jeremy.

21:14.687 --> 21:18.714
And here, deleted messages
marked from Unknown.

21:18.791 --> 21:24.058
There's like two or three
every day, and six yesterday.

21:25.431 --> 21:27.991
See if you can
undelete God's word.

21:31.704 --> 21:35.367
All I'm finding
are frags. Here.

21:35.441 --> 21:39.810
"You won't be alone. I'll guide
your hand. I hear your prayers. "

21:39.878 --> 21:43.075
"Didn't I show you her sin?
Why do you still have doubts?"

21:43.148 --> 21:44.615
This girl's good.

21:46.619 --> 21:49.520
What? You don't believe she wrote these?

21:49.588 --> 21:51.715
Well...
She's setting up a defense.

21:51.790 --> 21:55.624
Then why delete the messages?
Unless God asked her to.

21:55.694 --> 21:57.218
You owe me a Danish.

21:58.030 --> 22:01.193
The messages from God, they
were traced back to a computer.

22:01.266 --> 22:02.563
Hers.

22:04.203 --> 22:06.637
We bought her the computer.
She'd never owned one.

22:07.406 --> 22:08.600
She grew up
in Vermont?

22:08.974 --> 22:10.168
On a farm.

22:10.909 --> 22:14.345
Maybe if we had hired someone
with a little more savvy...

22:14.413 --> 22:15.778
She loves your son.

22:16.215 --> 22:17.273
Yes.

22:17.349 --> 22:21.149
And these kids.
Orphans from 9l11.

22:21.220 --> 22:23.916
She told us that was the
reason she moved to the city.

22:23.989 --> 22:25.980
She read about
all the orphans.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.119
Okay, let's get
you some juice, huh?

22:28.193 --> 22:29.217
These messages

22:29.294 --> 22:32.855
were definitely sent over the
Internet from this terminal.

22:32.998 --> 22:35.728
Well, that computer
has a Wi-Fi, doesn't it?

22:37.236 --> 22:40.228
Someone could hack in,
you know, send messages.

22:40.305 --> 22:43.035
Sure, but the range
would be limited.

22:43.108 --> 22:45.770
The hacker would have to
be inside the building.

22:48.847 --> 22:51.111
She said
God showed her things.

22:56.789 --> 22:59.053
The locked door in
the parking garage.

23:00.192 --> 23:01.682
The toolbox.

23:02.161 --> 23:03.651
Hillary Martz.

23:05.330 --> 23:06.854
That birthmark.

23:07.900 --> 23:09.492
It's Jay Peerson.

23:12.705 --> 23:13.694
The lab checked.

23:13.772 --> 23:16.400
The photos were definitely
taken with her camera.

23:16.475 --> 23:17.999
Someone borrowed it.

23:18.077 --> 23:19.237
Isn't it
more likely

23:19.311 --> 23:22.747
this is an elaborate ruse
to mount an insanity defense?

23:23.348 --> 23:26.784
Well, we heard that she refused
a psychiatric evaluation.

23:26.852 --> 23:28.376
Still, have you
considered the possibility

23:28.454 --> 23:31.981
she has another motive to kill
Mr. Peerson and Mrs. Martz?

23:32.057 --> 23:34.548
Maybe she's in love
with Mr. Martz.

23:35.060 --> 23:37.051
Maybe she thought she
was doing him a favor

23:37.129 --> 23:39.154
killing his wife,
his enemy.

23:41.133 --> 23:44.762
We would've found evidence
of her devotion to Martz.

23:44.837 --> 23:46.930
Photos, a diary.

23:48.640 --> 23:52.633
No, her only devotion
is to children and God.

23:55.380 --> 23:56.870
She could've taken
this picture of Hillary.

23:56.949 --> 23:58.541
But this one of
Jay Peerson...

24:00.986 --> 24:04.012
These shadows
in the picture.

24:06.992 --> 24:10.393
He's lying down,
maybe on a bed.

24:11.630 --> 24:13.222
The image is compressed.

24:13.365 --> 24:14.957
A telephoto lens?

24:15.033 --> 24:19.868
These pictures were taken from
far away, from a high angle.

24:20.873 --> 24:23.068
Don't tell me.
By an angel.

24:27.813 --> 24:29.747
At least in Brewster
we had a garden.

24:29.815 --> 24:33.182
Look, I don't want to sell, all
right? We'll lose our shirts.

24:33.252 --> 24:34.879
Fred, help me
out here, buddy.

24:34.953 --> 24:38.150
Fred, you of all people, after
what nearly happened to Hillary...

24:38.223 --> 24:42.091
Victor's right. You sell
now, we all take a bath.

24:51.069 --> 24:52.593
Now you're...

24:52.671 --> 24:55.572
Your husband would've
been lying right here.

24:57.209 --> 25:01.703
She must have snuck in from the
balcony to take that picture.

25:01.780 --> 25:03.304
Thanks, Darla.

25:11.623 --> 25:14.319
Well, the shot would
have been from this side.

25:19.665 --> 25:21.724
Well, I guess
from further back...

25:28.240 --> 25:32.973
Yeah, this is right.
It's just a higher angle.

25:33.045 --> 25:34.376
Above you.

25:35.948 --> 25:37.813
I wonder what's behind that wall.

25:42.921 --> 25:44.718
This is it.
This is the east chase.

25:44.790 --> 25:46.655
It runs up
the back of the building.

25:49.328 --> 25:51.091
Those are
the vents up there.

25:51.163 --> 25:53.631
Somebody could've climbed up
and taken the pictures.

25:53.699 --> 25:56.224
Is there access to this
shaft from the apartments?

25:56.301 --> 25:59.498
They all have trapdoors
they could crawl through.

26:05.744 --> 26:08.804
I can't see Anne Marie
climbing around in here.

26:10.549 --> 26:12.312
Well, whoever it was

26:13.719 --> 26:15.414
heard her prayers.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.307
God told me
to look in the camera

26:36.375 --> 26:38.707
and these pictures
were in there.

26:41.313 --> 26:43.679
We think someone took
advantage of you, Anne Marie.

26:46.418 --> 26:49.785
These pictures,
the text messages,

26:52.024 --> 26:53.013
they are not
from God.

26:53.091 --> 26:54.115
That's not true.

26:54.192 --> 26:56.092
Anne Marie,
just listen.

26:57.596 --> 27:03.398
This was taken from inside a
vent in Mr. Peerson's bathroom.

27:03.468 --> 27:06.596
Somebody was in the
shaft behind the wall.

27:06.672 --> 27:10.540
The one of Mrs. Martz was taken
the same way, with your camera.

27:10.709 --> 27:12.404
No, but my camera
was in my room.

27:12.477 --> 27:13.842
They borrowed it.

27:13.912 --> 27:16.278
The same person
got into your apartment

27:16.415 --> 27:18.781
through a trapdoor
in the hall closet.

27:18.850 --> 27:22.650
Mr. Peerson, Mrs. Martz,
they weren't having an affair.

27:22.821 --> 27:27.281
Yes, they were. Mr. Peerson
wasn't happy in his marriage.

27:27.359 --> 27:30.692
I heard him arguing with Mrs.
Peerson when I was on their balcony.

27:30.796 --> 27:33.196
Anne Marie,
the God that you know

27:35.200 --> 27:38.226
doesn't ask people
to kill in his name.

27:38.870 --> 27:41.896
I wasn't sure, but then
God made it easy for me.

27:41.974 --> 27:45.933
Made it easy to kill Mr. Peerson? How?

27:46.011 --> 27:49.572
He showed me these pictures
and then he told me what to do.

27:49.648 --> 27:52.014
But I was weak
and scared.

27:52.084 --> 27:53.381
So God let me
go to sleep,

27:53.452 --> 27:56.751
and in the morning, he said
that I had done a good thing,

27:56.822 --> 27:58.756
that Mr. Peerson was dead.

27:58.824 --> 28:01.122
You don't remember
actually killing him?

28:01.193 --> 28:02.922
I do now.

28:03.161 --> 28:05.254
God said I didn't
have a choice,

28:05.330 --> 28:08.493
that I needed to finish
what he had asked me to do.

28:08.567 --> 28:11.297
Anne Marie, you didn't kill Mr. Peerson.

28:12.571 --> 28:16.234
Somebody convinced you
to weaken your resistance

28:16.308 --> 28:18.333
so you could
kill Mrs. Martz.

28:18.410 --> 28:20.776
No, I killed Mr. Peerson.

28:20.846 --> 28:23.872
I remember. God showed me how I did it.

28:23.949 --> 28:25.211
God showed you?

28:27.652 --> 28:28.914
Show us how.

28:32.524 --> 28:36.051
I picked this up and
then I squeezed this.

28:48.507 --> 28:52.204
I guess he forgot to show
you to use the safety.

28:58.650 --> 29:03.917
Now you didn't hurt anybody, Anne
Marie. The messages were all lies.

29:11.196 --> 29:12.356
Oh, God.

29:18.537 --> 29:20.368
I almost killed...

29:24.776 --> 29:26.971
Oh, God, I'm so stupid.

29:28.380 --> 29:30.439
I'm so stupid.

29:31.249 --> 29:33.308
You're not stupid.

29:34.219 --> 29:36.517
You're not stupid
to have faith.

29:46.631 --> 29:48.360
You'd think
she'd be relieved.

29:48.433 --> 29:52.392
It's a big comedown from
God's avenger to prize patsy.

29:54.506 --> 29:56.770
We need to put her
on a suicide watch.

29:56.842 --> 29:58.867
And you need to figure out
who pulled her strings.

29:58.944 --> 30:02.539
She said Jay Peerson and
his wife were arguing.

30:03.882 --> 30:07.978
The night Peerson was killed, he
was outside with his binoculars.

30:08.053 --> 30:12.422
Maybe what he was
spying on was his wife.

30:15.026 --> 30:18.928
Maybe she's the one
having the affair, not him.

30:18.997 --> 30:20.931
Well, if Darla Peerson
has a lover,

30:20.999 --> 30:23.524
it's a good bet he's the
one who killed her husband

30:23.602 --> 30:25.229
and set up Anne Marie.

30:25.303 --> 30:27.237
My money's
on Fred Martz.

30:27.305 --> 30:29.466
Getting rid
of Jay Peerson

30:29.541 --> 30:32.635
and then his own wife
is cheaper than a divorce.

30:32.811 --> 30:35.871
This building's quite
the steamy little beehive.

30:36.915 --> 30:38.712
There's no evidence
Fred and Darla

30:38.783 --> 30:40.808
were sweating up
the sheets off campus.

30:42.187 --> 30:46.283
If they were sneaking into each other's
apartments, why didn't anyone notice?

30:46.358 --> 30:48.451
Aren't there security cameras
every two feet in that building?

30:48.527 --> 30:49.585
Not in the shaft.

30:49.661 --> 30:52.755
That's probably how Martz
got into Darla's apartment.

30:52.831 --> 30:53.820
Well, this is
interesting.

30:53.899 --> 30:57.426
These notes Peerson made
for a board meeting.

30:57.502 --> 30:59.732
He found out
from Victor Garros

30:59.804 --> 31:03.433
that Martz paid 20 grand under the table

31:03.508 --> 31:06.204
to get his
floating wall finished.

31:08.146 --> 31:10.137
How would
Victor know that?

31:10.215 --> 31:13.412
Might be one of those secrets you
overhear from inside the shaft.

31:15.487 --> 31:17.785
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

31:20.625 --> 31:22.149
How you
been doing?

31:23.628 --> 31:25.425
It's difficult.
I miss Jay.

31:25.797 --> 31:26.855
I know.

31:26.932 --> 31:30.299
Losing your husband all of a
sudden like that, it cuts very deep.

31:31.102 --> 31:32.899
It's even worse when
you've been arguing.

31:32.971 --> 31:34.734
We didn't argue.

31:34.806 --> 31:37.434
Anne Marie heard you
from the balcony.

31:38.109 --> 31:40.805
I'm not saying we had
a fairy-tale marriage,

31:40.879 --> 31:43.404
but our arguments
didn't mean anything.

31:44.049 --> 31:45.914
I like fairy tales.

31:46.751 --> 31:48.981
Especially
the one about Rapunzel.

31:52.524 --> 31:55.254
This was shot
last night

31:56.695 --> 32:01.132
in the service shaft
behind your apartment.

32:01.866 --> 32:06.098
"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair. "

32:07.739 --> 32:09.400
Isn't that Victor?

32:10.208 --> 32:13.575
The trapdoor leads
right into your closet.

32:13.645 --> 32:17.911
And, Ms. Peerson, we need
you to explain this to us.

32:20.318 --> 32:24.379
Jay and I were living up
in Stamford two years ago.

32:25.323 --> 32:28.258
I went to
a wedding in Brewster.

32:28.326 --> 32:32.228
We all stayed at Victor and
Maureen's bed-and-breakfast.

32:33.798 --> 32:37.063
One night,
I had too much champagne,

32:37.135 --> 32:38.568
and then

32:40.472 --> 32:42.463
I had Victor.

32:43.808 --> 32:45.366
You kept
seeing each other?

32:45.944 --> 32:47.502
Yeah.

32:48.146 --> 32:50.614
When Jay and I moved back
to the city six months ago,

32:50.682 --> 32:52.513
I thought
that would end it.

32:52.584 --> 32:57.521
And then next thing I know,
Victor has moved in downstairs.

32:57.989 --> 33:01.857
He chased after you. Did he
want you to leave your husband?

33:02.460 --> 33:03.893
He asked me.

33:03.962 --> 33:08.524
But Victor's a boy.
You know, he was fun.

33:10.635 --> 33:11.829
Jay was

33:13.738 --> 33:16.605
a man, you know.
He was a husband.

33:19.477 --> 33:20.967
I loved him.

33:22.547 --> 33:27.382
Ms. Peerson, the night that
your husband was killed,

33:30.755 --> 33:32.950
do you know
where Victor was?

33:33.725 --> 33:35.352
He was with me.

33:35.427 --> 33:37.054
What time?
Do you know?

33:37.195 --> 33:39.891
He came up
just after 9:30.

33:40.765 --> 33:44.030
That gives him enough time to call
Jay and get back from the park.

33:45.603 --> 33:47.230
What do you mean?

33:47.906 --> 33:50.636
We believe he killed your husband.

33:53.878 --> 33:56.938
That...
You told me that girl...

33:57.682 --> 34:00.150
She doesn't
remember doing it,

34:00.218 --> 34:02.812
someone convinced her
that she did.

34:04.656 --> 34:08.888
And convinced her to
attack Hillary Martz.

34:10.695 --> 34:12.322
Not Victor...

34:14.099 --> 34:20.902
This picture was taken through
the bathroom vent from the shaft.

34:29.313 --> 34:32.943
So Victor killed Peerson to
give him a clear shot at Darla?

34:33.016 --> 34:36.543
And he targeted Hillary Martz to
set up Anne Marie as a suspect.

34:36.621 --> 34:40.853
The only transgression of his we
actually can prove is infidelity.

34:43.360 --> 34:45.659
Well, maybe we can
do better than that.

34:57.509 --> 34:59.340
Jeez, you scared me.

35:01.813 --> 35:03.576
Well, you said
to come up.

35:03.648 --> 35:05.445
Yeah, I know,
I just didn't...

35:06.251 --> 35:12.156
Well, since we don't have
to worry about Jay anymore,

35:12.991 --> 35:14.822
the next time
I'll knock.

35:17.061 --> 35:19.461
I need to talk
to you about that.

35:21.566 --> 35:24.831
I'm staying with my sister
until I sort things out.

35:27.672 --> 35:29.663
Your sister
in San Diego?

35:31.543 --> 35:33.443
Yeah, I can't
stay here anymore.

35:34.879 --> 35:36.642
No, I get it,
I get it.

35:38.450 --> 35:43.149
Hey, you just... You just
need to give it some time.

35:45.356 --> 35:46.755
The police were here.

35:47.926 --> 35:50.394
They said that crazy girl
was planning to kill me.

35:53.998 --> 35:58.196
Well, I mean,
that doesn't sound right.

35:59.771 --> 36:01.898
They said
I was on her list.

36:03.475 --> 36:05.500
Things happen
for a reason, right?

36:08.079 --> 36:09.944
Hey, hey.

36:10.215 --> 36:12.308
You're hurting me.

36:12.951 --> 36:14.316
Don't...
After...

36:19.390 --> 36:22.257
After all I did,
you know,

36:23.828 --> 36:26.558
to move in
this building, huh,

36:28.333 --> 36:29.925
to be near you?

36:43.147 --> 36:46.674
We're sorry to bother you.
I left my binder. Thanks.

36:49.020 --> 36:51.045
Hi. There's a board
meeting tomorrow.

36:51.122 --> 36:53.989
I just stopped by to
pick up Jay's files, so...

36:54.058 --> 36:56.652
Are you going somewhere, Ms. Peerson?

36:56.794 --> 36:59.661
I'm going to my sister's in California.

36:59.731 --> 37:01.289
I'm catching a flight this afternoon.

37:01.366 --> 37:03.527
Well, I hope it wasn't
something that we said earlier.

37:03.601 --> 37:06.798
Well, you convinced her that Anne
Marie's going to kill her, so...

37:06.871 --> 37:09.601
Well, there is evidence
she targeted Ms. Peerson.

37:09.674 --> 37:12.541
I wasn't aware of that, but,
you know, the girl's in jail now,

37:12.610 --> 37:14.874
so she can't
hurt anyone now.

37:14.946 --> 37:16.504
Well, it's not
just her.

37:16.581 --> 37:19.914
I mean, all this stuff going
wrong with this building.

37:19.984 --> 37:22.851
Maybe Anne Marie's right. You know,
maybe it's a sign of something.

37:22.921 --> 37:26.152
A sign?
That girl is delusional.

37:27.125 --> 37:28.149
Detectives...

37:28.226 --> 37:30.126
Don't dismiss it
so easily.

37:30.194 --> 37:33.459
You know, neurologists have
studied the minds of Carmelite nuns

37:33.531 --> 37:35.999
who have had
mystical experiences.

37:36.067 --> 37:38.797
They're finding that
some people are,

37:38.870 --> 37:40.667
you know, tuned into
different frequencies.

37:40.738 --> 37:42.205
Yeah?

37:42.273 --> 37:44.434
I can't believe I'm hearing
this from a New York City cop.

37:44.509 --> 37:47.569
Some of the things
Anne Marie saw in her dreams,

37:47.845 --> 37:49.836
like cement turning to white powder,

37:49.914 --> 37:52.542
that's actually happening to
this building's foundation.

37:52.617 --> 37:57.554
Right, that's efflorescence,
you know. I showed her that.

37:57.655 --> 38:01.113
Okay. I mean, the concrete... The
concrete isn't water-sealed, all right?

38:01.192 --> 38:03.956
There's nothing mystical
about this girl.

38:04.028 --> 38:05.620
Well, we'll see.

38:06.030 --> 38:07.554
Anyway, thank you
for talking to us.

38:07.632 --> 38:09.190
Do you need help
with your suitcases?

38:09.267 --> 38:10.962
I can...
I can help her.

38:11.235 --> 38:12.896
No, I'll go down
with them.

38:12.971 --> 38:15.303
We'll need your contact
number in California.

38:15.373 --> 38:16.863
If the girl does
get out on bail,

38:16.941 --> 38:19.569
she might want to
finish what she started.

38:19.644 --> 38:21.908
Okay, I'm ready.

38:22.113 --> 38:23.808
Coming?

38:25.617 --> 38:27.346
Hey, this...

38:29.354 --> 38:33.620
This evidence that Anne
Marie's gonna kill her,

38:34.025 --> 38:35.822
what is it?

38:35.893 --> 38:37.884
It's a photograph.

38:38.229 --> 38:41.824
A photograph. Did
you... Did you know that?

38:42.567 --> 38:44.501
I knew there was
a photo of Jay.

38:44.569 --> 38:46.434
I didn't know
there was one of me.

38:46.504 --> 38:49.701
Well, I mean, I think she has a right
to see it, if that's why she's leaving.

38:49.774 --> 38:53.710
Well, it was on
Anne Marie's camera,

38:54.278 --> 38:57.873
along with
the other photos.

39:02.620 --> 39:06.818
And how does this mean that
she was planning on killing her?

39:06.891 --> 39:12.124
No, it's like the photos of
Mr. Peerson and Hillary Martz.

39:12.196 --> 39:14.994
Didn't she say
something about God

39:15.066 --> 39:16.499
putting those pictures
on her camera,

39:16.567 --> 39:18.432
or some such nonsense? I
mean, that's what I heard.

39:18.503 --> 39:20.232
That's what she'd like
us to believe, but...

39:20.304 --> 39:24.172
Well... She obviously
took this. Come on. Look.

39:27.512 --> 39:29.002
See this?

39:29.080 --> 39:33.244
This chair, right, in the background,
right? And that painting, okay?

39:34.118 --> 39:38.214
So that means, Darla,
you were probably here.

39:38.289 --> 39:39.654
Anne Marie was out there on the balcony.

39:39.724 --> 39:41.817
Didn't you say she was spying
on you from the balcony?

39:41.893 --> 39:43.383
Didn't you tell me that?

39:43.461 --> 39:44.951
I don't
see your point.

39:45.029 --> 39:47.862
My point is, it's not
like the other photos.

39:47.932 --> 39:51.231
It's not trying to act
like it was taken by God.

39:51.302 --> 39:55.466
Don't worry. We don't think God
actually took any of those pictures.

39:56.307 --> 39:58.400
Right, I know.
I'm saying...

39:59.877 --> 40:04.905
The other photos, right? You can't
tell how they were taken, right?

40:04.982 --> 40:07.542
They were close up,
from a high angle.

40:07.618 --> 40:09.518
Let me check.

40:13.257 --> 40:15.623
Yeah, I see
your point.

40:15.693 --> 40:19.151
Right. It's not like
the other ones, right?

40:19.230 --> 40:21.425
I mean, this photo
is meaningless,

40:21.532 --> 40:23.727
so, I mean, you panicked for nothing.

40:23.801 --> 40:26.269
How did you know
about the high angle?

40:26.471 --> 40:28.871
I could hardly notice
by glancing at it.

40:31.209 --> 40:33.541
Ms. Peerson told me.

40:33.611 --> 40:34.669
No, I didn't.

40:37.048 --> 40:40.484
They calculated the angle
that the photo was taken.

40:40.551 --> 40:42.212
Turns out that it was
taken from the shaft

40:42.286 --> 40:44.481
that runs up
the back of the building.

40:44.555 --> 40:46.989
Well, I don't know anything about that.

40:47.058 --> 40:48.821
Are you sure?

40:55.366 --> 40:58.529
We put a night-vision camera
into the shaft a couple days ago.

41:08.212 --> 41:11.841
The fancier the building, the
bigger the vermin in the wall.

41:16.487 --> 41:18.216
You took the photo.

41:19.524 --> 41:21.856
You put it on Anne Marie's camera.

41:22.426 --> 41:24.326
You sent
those messages.

41:27.031 --> 41:30.467
You let her believe
that she was a murderer.

41:33.070 --> 41:35.038
You corrupted
her faith,

41:36.574 --> 41:39.008
pure faith to serve
your own evil.

41:41.779 --> 41:43.644
To kill your lover's
husband.

41:46.551 --> 41:48.451
No, no.

41:49.520 --> 41:52.853
Darla, I didn't kill Jay.

41:53.324 --> 41:54.757
Don't lie to me.

41:56.494 --> 41:57.893
She knows
what you did.

41:57.962 --> 42:00.954
Why do you think she
asked you to come up here?

42:06.204 --> 42:08.069
Now how could
you do that?

42:08.739 --> 42:10.229
How could she?

42:11.642 --> 42:14.167
Oh! Well, you mean 'cause you spent
all that money following her around.

42:14.245 --> 42:17.476
You know, crawling around
in the dark like a bug.

42:19.283 --> 42:23.242
Debasing yourself. You
know what she told us?

42:24.555 --> 42:27.183
She told us
you're like a boy, Victor.

42:29.427 --> 42:32.590
And Jay, Jay's like a man.

42:37.768 --> 42:38.826
And guess what?

42:40.504 --> 42:44.304
Your man didn't do half
of what I did for you.

42:44.442 --> 42:46.410

43:04.395 --> 43:05.987
You look at me!

43:12.536 --> 43:13.798
