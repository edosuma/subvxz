00:08.134 --> 00:11.592
On Tuesday morning,
a dead tiger shark
washed up on Rehoboth Beach.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.512
Its stomach contained
the undigested remains
of a human leg.

00:14.599 --> 00:16.510
- Ouch.
- What’s wrong?

00:16.601 --> 00:18.592
- That’s gotta hurl.
- A seasoned law
enforcement agent...

00:18.686 --> 00:22.474
who still has empathy for a victim—
l’m glad to know you’re out there.

00:22.565 --> 00:24.681
At your service.

00:24.775 --> 00:27.187
Dr. Bryar is from the National
Atmos-Ocean Association.

00:27.278 --> 00:30.816
- Called us this morning.
- The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.

00:30.907 --> 00:33.319
Well, Andrew was joking.
He likes to put people
atease.

00:33.409 --> 00:37.402
- It’s a nice quality.
- Yeah, everybody likes to laugh.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.158
- Except that guy.
- [ Booth, Bryar Laugh ]

00:40.291 --> 00:44.125
The weird thing is
nobody reported a shark attack
anywhere along the eastern seaboard.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.203
[Hacker]
Do you think you can make
an identiﬁcation from the leg?

00:46.297 --> 00:48.879
I’ve seen Temperance ID. a victim
from a single fingernail clipping.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.878
- But I’ve never done that.
- Well, maybe not that.

00:51.969 --> 00:54.301
But, you know,
things like that, you know?

00:54.388 --> 00:56.424
She’s my partner.
I’m sure we could help you out.

00:56.557 --> 01:00.175
I’d be grateful.
Yeah.
[Murmurs]

01:05.441 --> 01:08.604
Yeah, I should go and clear out.
I’ll let you do your thing—

01:13.366 --> 01:16.699
Well, that was a speedy exit.
Shall we ?

01:18.329 --> 01:20.445
[Brennan ]
The Victim is likely male.

01:20.539 --> 01:23.326
These shallow cuts
and deep gouges,

01:23.417 --> 01:25.624
in conjunction
with location of recovery,

01:25.711 --> 01:27.702
are likely indications
of COD.

01:27.797 --> 01:30.504
We— We need to count osteons
to determine age.

01:30.591 --> 01:34.925
But the length of the tibia
indicates a height of between
five foot and 5’6”.

01:35.012 --> 01:38.175
- A short guy
got bit by a shark?
- [ Brennan] Now,

01:38.266 --> 01:41.258
these look like
six-ridged dermal denticles.

01:41.352 --> 01:44.185
Well, that can’t be.
A tiger shark doesn’t
he I/e dermal denticles.

01:44.272 --> 01:47.480
Then the victim encountered
multiple predators
at the same time.

01:47.566 --> 01:52.435
- That is highly unlikely.
- Well, this simple
symmetrical bite.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.607
That’s a tiger shark.
This is different.

01:54.699 --> 01:58.317
Some kind of small
conical canine.

01:58.411 --> 02:03.496
- That’s a red snapper.
- Then... this serrated bite.

02:03.582 --> 02:06.619
Oh, my God.
A hammerhead

02:06.711 --> 02:09.578
- What? This sounds good.
- Hammerheads are tropical.

02:09.672 --> 02:11.628
It’s unlikely you’d
find one this far north.

02:11.716 --> 02:15.254
Where ’5 the nearest place
a tiger shark, a hammerhead...

02:15.344 --> 02:17.630
and a red snapper
could coexist?

02:17.722 --> 02:20.008
How about the aquarium?
[ Chuckles ]

02:20.099 --> 02:22.055
You don’t get to be
deputy director of the F.B.I....

02:22.143 --> 02:24.885
by just dressing well and kissing ass.
[ Chuckles ]

02:24.979 --> 02:28.221
Okay, yeah, that’s most of it.
But I’m probably right about the aquarium.

02:35.531 --> 02:39.649
[ Brennan ] According to NOAA,
this facility focuses on marine rescue
and preservation.

02:39.744 --> 02:44.363
A rehabilitated tiger shark
was permanently released
into the ocean this Saturday.

02:44.457 --> 02:47.494
[ Booth ]
Jaws grabs a quick snack before
heading back out into the wild?

02:47.585 --> 02:50.042
Shark attacks are very rare.

02:50.129 --> 02:52.370
I mean, look, sharks,
they don’t even like
to eat people.

02:52.465 --> 02:55.047
- That’s true.
How do you know that?
- Shark Week, you know,

02:55.134 --> 02:57.420
where they do nothing
but make you afraid of sharks.

02:58.721 --> 03:01.007
Wait. They have
a week set aside
just for sharks?

03:01.098 --> 03:03.931
Wow. Yeah.
It’s a TV thing.

03:05.269 --> 03:07.601
- [ Woman ] Agent Booth?
- Yes, Dr. Stoddard.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.179
Marilyn. Iwork in
the animal husbandry department.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.985
Was someone eaten here
this weekend?
[ Laughs] No.

03:16.072 --> 03:18.814
The t/ger shark that you
released this past Saturday,

03:18.908 --> 03:21.115
can you show us
where you kept him?

03:21.202 --> 03:22.783
Yeah. Come right this way.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.781
Since when do fish
have husbands?

03:24.872 --> 03:27.409
Animal husbandry is the science
of breeding livestock.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.999
Since when
are fish livestock?
The term can be applied loosely.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.791
This is the tropical
reef tank...

03:34.882 --> 03:37.589
where the tiger shark
was kept prior to release.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.712
Originally,
he required isolation.

03:39.804 --> 03:43.046
But once he recovered, we placed
him in here to see how he would
interact with the others.

03:43.140 --> 03:47.634
- Recovered from what?
- His fin was nearly severed,
probably from a drag net.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.344
How’d he get on
with the other fish?

03:50.439 --> 03:53.431
- Just fine, as far as I can tell.
- You also have a hammerhead?

03:53.526 --> 03:55.437
Uh, yes,
hiding somewhere.

03:55.528 --> 03:59.271
This tank is over 600,000
gallons. You can only see
a portion from this side.

03:59.365 --> 04:01.356
[Booth ]
Looks like an ocean in itself

04:01.450 --> 04:04.237
[ Stoddard]
it is, but l’m pretty sure
we would see evidence...

04:04.328 --> 04:06.068
if a human being
had been eaten in there.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.491
Anyone missing?
Employees, you mean?

04:08.582 --> 04:11.244
- Or guests? No.
- How about missing a leg?

04:11.335 --> 04:14.327
No. lthink we would
notice something ﬁle that.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.583
Anything unusual?

04:16.674 --> 04:19.131
The facilities department
lost an expensive filter.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.334
There was a sl/ght sp/ke
in the ammonia levels,

04:21.429 --> 04:23.340
but nothing out
of the ordinary here.

04:23.431 --> 04:26.013
Certain/y, nothing close
to a fatal accident.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.591
- i 30y]
Look! Oh, Dad!
- [ Woman] Oh, my gosh!

04:28.686 --> 04:32.474
[People Gasping, Shattering]

04:33.774 --> 04:35.639
[Man ]
Step back, please.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.519
Security!
Okay, now who’s gonna
go in there to get that?

05:20.237 --> 05:22.319
[Booth ]
Okay, you don’t have
to go in, Bones.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.522
Yes, I do. We need to recover
what’s left of the victim...

05:24.617 --> 05:26.528
to have any hope
of identification.

05:26.619 --> 05:29.201
Time-out, okay?
Have Hodgins do it.

05:29.288 --> 05:32.530
I look like Richard Dreyfuss, don’t I?
“We’re gonna need a bigger boat.”

05:32.625 --> 05:34.957
No, we don’t need a boat.
Why are you wearing that hat?

05:35.044 --> 05:38.707
Keep his brain warm, okay?
Make Hodgins go in there
and do it.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.833
There is nothing
to be afraid of, Booth.
[ Hodgins ] Yeah.

05:40.925 --> 05:44.884
- Sharks, they don’t eat people.
- Tell that to the guy who
got coughed up by a grouper.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.928
- Okay?
- Okay, who’s going in?

05:48.015 --> 05:50.222
- [Brennan] Um—
- You guys know what
you’re doing, right?

05:50.309 --> 05:52.220
It isn’t a swim in a fish tank.

05:52.311 --> 05:56.145
- Isn’t that exactly what it is?
- Yeah, a really big, cool one.

05:56.232 --> 05:59.816
No, no. it’s a recovery
of a body in the investigation
of a potential hom/c/de.

05:59.902 --> 06:02.860
Any questions, you ask me.
Keep your eyes on me.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.853
Gotcha.
Ready?

06:04.990 --> 06:07.777
Yes. I am.
Ben here will
escort you to the tank.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.779
Agent Booth, follow me.
You’ll be able to communicate...

06:09.870 --> 06:11.952
with Dr. Brennan
on our intercom system.
[Booth] Thank you.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.154
Good luck to you.

Bones? Bones, you there?

06:23.342 --> 06:25.503
[On Intercom]
We’re right here, Booth.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.585
This is beautiful.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.761
Hodgins, I’ll get the skull.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.809
You see if there’s
any other bone particulates.

06:51.579 --> 06:54.491
I have the interior aspect
of the skull.

06:54.582 --> 06:57.665
- You call it a face, Booth.
- Pipe down there, pal.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.334

Oh. Dr. Brennan, she’s still
working on the identification.

07:51.847 --> 07:54.133
Wow.
It’s what we do.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.260
Do you mind
if I ask you a question?

07:56.352 --> 07:59.970
Sure. Come on in.
This is my office.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.517
It’s very nice.
Yeah, right.

08:02.608 --> 08:06.066
Yeah. I was wondering if you
wanted to go out sometime.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.363
Maybe this weekend.
Unless, of course,
I’m a suspect.

08:11.450 --> 08:14.613
’Cause I know
you can’t date me
if I’m a suspect, right?

08:14.703 --> 08:18.161
- I can’t date anyone who’s a suspect.
- I understand.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.239
Yeah, right. It’s F.B.I.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.325
Rules, regulations.

08:22.461 --> 08:25.123
Yeah.
But, um,

08:25.214 --> 08:28.581
you know, when we’re done with you,
um, I can give you a call,

08:28.676 --> 08:33.045
and, um, you can go out with me
or/ can go out with you.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.754
- How about both?
- Hey, look at that.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.931
[Laughs]

08:38.018 --> 08:40.134
Well, I’m looking fonNard
to not being a suspect.

08:40.229 --> 08:41.765
I am too.

08:41.855 --> 08:45.689
Let me know if you hear anything more
about the identification.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.232
Yeah, yeah. lwill.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.775
All right.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.895
Bye.
Bye.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.034
[ Objects C/atter]

08:57.246 --> 08:59.237
[ Clark]
The pelvis verifies
the osteon count.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.617
He was between
the ages of 30 and 34.

09:01.709 --> 09:05.998
The fusion of the vertebrae
could indicate an injury
to the spinal cord.

09:06.130 --> 09:09.247
Huh. Anything
off the spectroscope?
Yes.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.582
The distal tibia from
the leg we found
originally—

09:11.677 --> 09:14.339
it confirms the presence
of perimortem bruising.

09:14.430 --> 09:16.716
When the shark attacked
the victim, he was still alive?

09:16.807 --> 09:18.889
Yes. Take
a look right here.

09:18.976 --> 09:22.514
I found a cleft fracture
of the styloid process.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.307
Probably a blunt force
to the throat.
And here,

09:24.398 --> 09:28.266
several multidirectional
grooves along the glabella
and the supra-orbital ridge.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.351
The victim
was stabbed in the eye?

09:30.446 --> 09:32.858
Varying degrees of force
may suggest...

09:32.948 --> 09:37.112
that someone tried
to stab the victim in the face
with a narrow, sharped object.

09:37.202 --> 09:40.786
Okay, well, that makes this
an official homicide.

09:40.914 --> 09:45.374
The victim was assaulted and then
dumped into the tank alive
as a means of disposal.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.748
I think I know when it happened.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.251
Meet D/p/or/la labryr/nth/Tormis,

09:51.341 --> 09:53.206
better known as the groovy
grooved brain coral,

09:53.343 --> 09:57.256
native to the Caribbean,
Bermuda and Bahamas.
Why is it here?

09:57.347 --> 09:59.679
Coral skeletons
accrete tiny
crystals...

09:59.767 --> 10:01.723
of calcium carbonate
at night.

10:01.810 --> 10:05.348
So for us, this provides a timeline
similar to tree rings.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.771
Coral can tell us
what was in the water
and when it got there.

10:07.858 --> 10:11.066
- If you have a year to wait.
- No, that is the beauty.

10:11.153 --> 10:14.941
Because of the rapid nature of the growth,
the timeline is condensed.

10:15.032 --> 10:17.865
- How specific is it?
- Within hours.

10:17.951 --> 10:22.991
Now, a spike in ammonia
and nitrate levels found
within the coral skeleton...

10:23.081 --> 10:26.539
tells us that something
died in that tank
on Friday night...

10:26.627 --> 10:30.495
between midnight
and 6:00 am.—
something big,

10:30.589 --> 10:33.501
like “human being” big.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.342
[ Booth ] These here
are the 28 people we know
who were at the aquarium...

10:41.433 --> 10:44.596
Saturday morning
between the hours
of midnight and 6:00 am.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.268
Most of them are employees
and security guards.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.308
[Cell Phone Rings]
Are all of them
still alive?

10:49.399 --> 10:52.106
We’re working
on that right now. Booth.

10:52.194 --> 10:54.856
This NOAA thing is turning
into a full-fledged investigation.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.365
Who is that?
Uh— [ Mouths Word ]

10:57.491 --> 11:01.109
Oh. Tell Andrew
I said hi.
Bones says hello.

11:01.203 --> 11:04.070
Hello. Tell her I’m really
looking forward to our date.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.326
Did you two wanna speak
to each other,

11:07.417 --> 11:09.703
or is there something
that you wanted to tell me, sir?

11:09.795 --> 11:13.208
I called ’cause I got
a heads-up on your
missing person.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.459
Yeah. Okay. Wow.

11:15.551 --> 11:16.882
Gotcha.
[Beeps]

11:17.010 --> 11:19.922
What did he say?
Uh, he’s looking
fonNard to our date.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.175
- Your date.
- Oh, so am I.

11:23.267 --> 11:26.555
He e-mailed me
and said he had
tickets to a play.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.806
He e-mailed you?
What, for a play?

11:28.897 --> 11:32.810
I believe that “play”
is Andrew’s code for sex.

11:34.611 --> 11:38.354
- Is it okay for us
to talk like this?
- Yeah.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.530
Well, when he invited me
to the play,

11:40.617 --> 11:42.573
I thought it was a code for sex,
so I said no.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.489
Oh.
But I said yes
to coffee.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.328
Maybe that’s a code.
Mm-mmm.
Angela informed me...

11:47.457 --> 11:50.494
that coffee isn’t
a code for anything.
Ha.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.664
I have a date too.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.165
Good.

11:55.257 --> 11:56.963
Catherine Bryar.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.006
Everyone at the aquarium
is a suspect.

11:59.094 --> 12:02.382
And once she’s eliminated
as a person of interest—

12:02.472 --> 12:04.599
- Why did Andrew call?
- Oh. [Clears Throat]

12:04.683 --> 12:09.177
Number 19 on our list,
uh, is not accounted for.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.973

Yeah.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.150
- What a ludicrous name.
- You don’t know who that is?

12:18.530 --> 12:20.566
My name is Jazz Gunn,

12:20.657 --> 12:23.034
and I have a secret
to tell you.

12:23.118 --> 12:26.406
in the simplest terms,
the terrestrial world
we live in...

12:26.496 --> 12:28.703
mirrors the underwater world
you see right here.

12:28.790 --> 12:32.328
Same rules
that govern the sea...

12:32.419 --> 12:35.582
also govern the sea of life.

12:35.672 --> 12:39.915
Jazz Gunn is your average—
and / do mean average—
se/f-he/p guru.

12:40.010 --> 12:43.093
His half-baked theory
is based on nothing more...

12:43.180 --> 12:45.262
than the concept
of natural selection.

12:45.349 --> 12:48.557
But his “Sea of Life”
seminars are packed.

12:48.644 --> 12:50.885
The shape of his skull
is consistent with that
of the victim.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.186
I’ve never heard of him.
[Booth ] l’ve heard of him.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.231
He spent Friday night
getting ready to prepare
for this b/g speech...

12:56.318 --> 12:59.481
that he was supposed to give
this morning at the aquarium,
and he never showed up.

12:59.571 --> 13:03.484
He said that he had
a car accident in ’93
that left him unable to walk.

13:03.575 --> 13:08.490
But after he swam in the sea
off the coast of Brazil,
he was cured.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.571
What, like a miracle?

13:10.666 --> 13:12.622
Like this power
of positive thinking?

13:12.709 --> 13:14.745
- lt’s preposterous.
- He swam with sharks.

13:14.836 --> 13:19.500
He said that by forcing himself
to face his ata vistic fears,

13:19.591 --> 13:21.707
he gained the strength
to fight back.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.339
That’s the whole theory
behind the “Sea of Life.”

13:24.429 --> 13:27.421
What, so now this guy,
he gets paid a hundred bucks a pop...

13:27.516 --> 13:29.757
to talk about that
in front of fish tanks?

13:29.851 --> 13:31.762
Let’s begin with
life lesson number one:

13:31.853 --> 13:33.354
Eat or be eaten.

13:33.438 --> 13:37.306
What if your friends
and neighbors tried to eat you?

13:37.401 --> 13:39.687
Look at this guy.
His name’s Tad Benedict.

13:39.778 --> 13:44.522
Benedict used to be Jazz’s assistant,
but, uh, now Jazz does it solo.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.574
They had a widely
publicized falling-out.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.118
What does he have
in his hand?

13:50.247 --> 13:53.205
[Sweets] Uh, that’s a pen.
[Brennan ]
That looks like a metal stylus.

13:53.291 --> 13:56.624
The victim was stabbed
with a small, sharp object.

13:56.712 --> 14:00.671
Theodore Benedict. He’s on our
list of people that were there
at the aquarium Friday night.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.008
Maybe Jazz hired him back.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.299
Or maybe he just showed up
with a chip on his shoulder.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.798
And a pointy pointer
in his hand.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.844
Or like life lesson number one.

14:08.932 --> 14:12.220
Eat or be eaten.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.972
[Jazz Continues, indistinct ]
...eat or be eaten.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.607
- [Booth] Tad, is it?
- Yeah.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.615
I can’t believe this happened.
Who would wanna kill Jazz?
People love him.

14:32.748 --> 14:37.287
The easy answer is you.
You worked for him three years ago?
Off and on.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.119
- Starting three years ago, yeah.
- Let’s forget about the “on.”

14:40.255 --> 14:44.339
Let’s just focus on the “off.”
Says you were dismissed after
an argument over compensation?

14:44.426 --> 14:45.916
I wanted a share
of the profits.

14:46.011 --> 14:49.003
I felt like I did a lot of work,
and he made all the money.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.474
I couldn’t think
of a clearer motive. You?

14:51.558 --> 14:54.300
- Do I look like I could do that?
- No, but I’ve seen the video.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.305
Jazz is about, what, 5’4”?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.808
The way you were wie/din’
that little crazy pen around
of yours that you had,

14:58.899 --> 15:00.309
it was pretty fierce.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.812
You do know that that fight
was all over, right?

15:02.903 --> 15:05.189
He called me
a couple of months ago...

15:05.280 --> 15:07.487
when he oversold
a seminar in Santa Fe.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.031
He needed help and apologized.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.074
I needed thejob,
so I went back to work.

15:12.162 --> 15:15.370
- Does he pay you?
- / get a percentage after each
seminar, just like lasked.

15:15.457 --> 15:19.951
And he took me and my wife
to Aspen for Christmas.
I more than forgave him.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.874
You wanna know
what I think, Agent Booth?

15:25.467 --> 15:29.301
- Sure.
- Jazz loved the sea.

15:29.387 --> 15:32.515
He wanted to swim
in that big tank
at the aquarium.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.510
He told me.

15:38.522 --> 15:42.140
is this a live feed
of the tropical reef tank
at the aquarium ?

15:42.234 --> 15:45.943
Yep. With an
interactive interface
I implemented myself.

15:46.029 --> 15:49.362
Check this out.
Click on this guy,

15:49.449 --> 15:52.532
the program has an index
that catalogs anything organic.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.985
This is incredible, Angela.
May I try?

15:55.080 --> 15:57.287
[ Hodgins ] Look what
lfound in the ﬁlter
from the aquarium.

15:57.374 --> 16:01.788
It’s a five-inch piece
of tanned, putrescible
animal rawhide.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.036
From a fish?
From a wallet.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.292
Well, if you go into
a fish tank willing/y,

16:06.383 --> 16:08.419
you remove your wallet, right?

16:08.510 --> 16:09.875
Yeah.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.803
Oh, wow.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.005
Oh, you should
leave this up.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.718
It’s beautiful,
peaceful, pure.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.928
It’s kind of scary,
though, right?

16:21.022 --> 16:24.014
- Oh, I like scary.
- Yeah, so do I.

16:30.574 --> 16:34.283
Clark is trying to determine
what sort of weapon
the killer may have used...

16:34.369 --> 16:36.325
when stabbing
at the victim’s face.

16:36.413 --> 16:39.951
Hodgins, please keep me posted
about what you find in the filter.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.579
Uh-huh.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.256
[Device Beeps]

16:50.343 --> 16:53.426
Did you have time
to examine the grooves?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.720
I did.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.716
Synnge?
Taking a closer look,

16:58.810 --> 17:00.721
I could see
some of the deeper grooves...

17:00.812 --> 17:03.724
had a faint semi-circular ridge
near the point of contact.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.602
/ thought it’d be
consistent with the hub
of a hypodermic needle.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.775
In terms of a diameter,
a 14-gauge would be
about right.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.103
But there are no matching grooves
on the styloid process.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.439
No. That injury
is simple blunt force.

17:13.533 --> 17:18.527
If the victim was stabbed with
a hypodermic needle, something
may have been injected.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.578
It’s hard to tell
with the body
being submerged.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.577
And I can’t find
the perfect needle
to match either.

17:23.668 --> 17:25.408
Maybe I can.

17:29.174 --> 17:31.460
Excuse me. We’re back.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.384
I see that.
Can I help you
with something?

17:34.512 --> 17:36.423
[ Chuckles ]
Why is she using
that tone?

17:36.514 --> 17:39.005
Well, she just doesn’t
like being pinned
as a murder suspect.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.227
I can deal with that.
What I don’t like...

17:41.311 --> 17:44.098
is having every piece
of information I give you
double-checked.

17:44.189 --> 17:46.555
- What can I do for you?
- We wanna take a look
at your hypodermic needles.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.647
All right.
What sort of needles?
Bones.

17:48.777 --> 17:51.814
Fourteen-gauge with a round
hub and a blunted tip.
Exacﬂy.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.816
Uh, we don’t carry
anything like that.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.488
Okay. Anything similar?

17:56.660 --> 17:58.571
I realize you need
to double-check, so please,

17:58.662 --> 18:00.618
go right ahead.

18:00.705 --> 18:04.118
Also need to know
who had access to it
the night the victim died.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.746
I wasn’t back here
that night.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.747
What’s wrong
with these angelfish?

18:08.838 --> 18:10.794
They’ve been listless
the past few days.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.168
ll/lost l/ke/y due
to something they ingested.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.251
Or someone.

18:15.387 --> 18:18.049
We should take these fish
back to the lab.
No, you can’t.

18:18.181 --> 18:20.547
These are a gift
from Morocco.
They need to be tested...

18:20.642 --> 18:23.008
for trace evidence
in a murder investigation.

18:23.103 --> 18:26.971
- We’ll get ’em back to you.
- I may or may not
get them back to you.

18:29.359 --> 18:33.022
Wait. You just said
that you weren’t here
that night.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.816
You already said
that you were.
No. Not in this area.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.772
No one was back here
after midnight.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.119
I was out in the lobby
helping with the kids.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.909
Kids? What kids?

18:41.997 --> 18:44.909
Our education department hosts field trips
for local elementary students.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.911
I was helping the teacher.

18:50.297 --> 18:54.586
[ Clears Throat]
I teach fourth grade.

18:54.676 --> 18:57.167
My students are mostly
nine- and 10-year-olds.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.924
We usually do
the Natural History Museum.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.381
And I thought
we’d try something new.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.634
So we tried the aquarium.
Wow.
Thirty-six kids overnight.

19:05.729 --> 19:08.812
That’s, uh—
That’s very brave of you.

19:08.898 --> 19:12.857
Well, kids that age,
when they fall asleep,
they’re like little corpses.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.352
Did you have any help?
Yes.

19:15.447 --> 19:17.938
Four mothers. And they’re the same
four mothers who do everything.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.649
- I can give you their names.
- That’d be great. Thanks.

19:20.744 --> 19:23.030
- Where did you sleep?
- In sleeping bags on the floor.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.657
- In the lobby.
- [ Chuckles ]

19:24.748 --> 19:27.535
The aquarium people left the lights on
in the big tank until midnight

19:27.625 --> 19:30.002
- It was beautiful.
- I’m just wondering,

19:30.086 --> 19:32.998
how is it that so many people
can spend the night
in front of a tank...

19:33.089 --> 19:35.751
and not see a man
being eaten by sharks?

19:37.427 --> 19:40.760
When they turned
the lights off, it was dark.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.964
Agent Booth, believe me.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.137
If one of those kids
had seen anything,
they would all know about it by now.

19:47.270 --> 19:50.387
Why?
First of all,
they’re blabbermouths.

19:50.482 --> 19:54.725
And second, they were all issued
these disposable cameras,

19:54.861 --> 19:56.852
and they take pictures
of everything.
Everything?

19:56.946 --> 19:58.447
Everything.

Kim, stop
hitting Steven.

20:03.661 --> 20:07.245
[Booth ] Just tell me
if an y of these kids
is a killer.

20:07.332 --> 20:10.950
It’s pretty tough to tell
your average nine-year—old
from your average psychopath.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.581
Don ’t say that
l have a kid nearly that age.

20:13.671 --> 20:16.504
Children are still forming
their sense of ethics
at this age.

20:16.591 --> 20:20.459
Like I said, they’re
basically sociopaths.
It’s true.

20:20.595 --> 20:23.928
[Woman ]
Kids, kids.
Hey. Aw, thanks, Lucy.

20:24.015 --> 20:28.224
Your photos will be returned
after they’re developed and
perused for the investigation.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.768
But what about the contest?

20:30.855 --> 20:32.891
[Whispering ]
We told the kids
it was a photo contest.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.974
Oh, that’s good. Spare them
the trauma of the murder.
Good idea.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.730
- Murder?
- No, no. No, no, no, no.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.938
No, no, no. Photo contest.
First pr/Ze: amusement park.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.273

- First place goes
to an amusement park.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.324
- I know.
- You can thank me
for saving you later. Next.

20:48.415 --> 20:52.249
So I’m looking
for evidence of
shark attack and murder...

20:52.335 --> 20:54.291
while simultaneously
judging a photo contest?

20:54.379 --> 20:57.371
You possess the necessary
overlapping skills.

20:57.465 --> 21:01.504
Well, between 36 disposables
and 10 cell phone cameras,

21:01.594 --> 21:04.336
we’ve got quite
a selection here.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.922
Ew.

21:08.017 --> 21:11.350
So you said that coffee isn’t
code for anything, right?

21:11.438 --> 21:14.430
Sweetie, I think
you need to stop
worrying about sex codes.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.435
Hacker is a very
up-front guy...

21:16.526 --> 21:19.108
who is also extremely
politically savvy.

21:19.237 --> 21:22.650
Talk about strange
overlapping skills, huh?
I don’t know what that means.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.822
Hacker is very sophisticated
in his job,

21:24.909 --> 21:27.776
but he’s much more transparent
in his personal life.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.782
Does that sound
like anybody you know?

21:29.873 --> 21:32.990
Me? So you mean we’re compatible?

21:33.084 --> 21:35.700
Well, you know who
lthink you belong with.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.787
I don’t belong with anyone,

21:38.882 --> 21:41.498
Well, I’m grappling
with those same issues.

21:41.593 --> 21:45.211
So, yes, go have
coffee with Hacker.

21:45.305 --> 21:49.674

then maybe you guys
can graduate to lunch.

- Clothing.

- Look at this.
- Let me see that one.

Let me see
ifl can scan this.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.450

Well, it’s deﬁnitely a person.
That’s not our victim.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.285
The proportions
are wrong.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.541
But no one
was supposed
to be back there.

22:21.633 --> 22:24.466
At 2:38 a. m.

22:24.552 --> 22:29.012
Hodgins said that
the victim died in the tank
between midnight and 6:00 am.

22:29.098 --> 22:31.555
So this could
definitely be our killer.

22:40.735 --> 22:45.069
[ Whirring ]

22:45.156 --> 22:47.818
Oh. That is the most
unpleasant smell.

22:47.909 --> 22:51.276
- Angelfish smoothie?
- Man, you killed
the Moroccan angelfish?

22:51.371 --> 22:54.989
No. No, I did not.
They died on their own.

22:55.124 --> 22:58.116
Only aftenNards
did I puree them.
lhope you can prove that.

22:58.253 --> 23:00.835
Those aquarium people
love their fish.
Don’t worry.

23:00.922 --> 23:04.835
The angelfish died
from a generic, organic
protein-based neurotoxin...

23:04.926 --> 23:07.087
that’s found in lots
of different yummy places,

23:07.178 --> 23:09.214
like the flagellum of bacteria.

23:09.305 --> 23:11.216
What, did they absorb it
through their gills?

23:11.307 --> 23:14.925
- I think they ingested it.
- By snacking on our victim.

23:15.019 --> 23:17.601
No. This neurotoxin’s
not strong enough to kill
a fully grown human male.

23:17.689 --> 23:22.103
Wait. What if it was
injected through his eye
more than once?

23:22.193 --> 23:25.731
Well, it’d be disorienting,
as would any injection
into the eye.

23:25.822 --> 23:28.564
Perhaps Dr. Saroyan
can find traces in what’s
left of the body. Thank you.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.656
Oh, hey, Clark.
I thought I should warn you.
Yeah?

23:30.743 --> 23:32.734
Angela and Wendell,
they broke up.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.990
I-I’m sorry.
What’s that
got to do with me?

Okay, okay, okay. Listen.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.299
I’m gonna— I’m gonna break
my cardinal rule for you...

23:45.383 --> 23:47.248
and offer some good advice.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.467
Don’t do that.
Do what?

23:49.554 --> 23:52.637
Channel your own frustrations
into snide allusions.

23:52.724 --> 23:56.342
Oh. Snide’s a strong word.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.687
Um, I, uh—

24:00.773 --> 24:03.515
I found this for you.
It was— It was in the vacuum.

24:04.694 --> 24:06.605
Looks like an enterolith.

24:06.696 --> 24:09.733

call it a hair ball.

your cardinal rule.

Why can ’t you just
lighten up the guy’s face
and zoom in ?

24:38.853 --> 24:41.811
Because it was
a cell phone camera
that was aimed by a child.

is a foot thick.

- At night.

24:46.027 --> 24:47.483
I was just asking.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.982
So / used some
warping software...

24:50.073 --> 24:52.359
to reverse the direction
of the distortion...

24:52.450 --> 24:54.441
that was caused
by the waves
in the surface of the water.

24:54.535 --> 24:57.527
Then I lit it up.
But this is the best
that I can do.

24:57.622 --> 25:00.659
Okay. Well,
we’ll print that up
and get it to Booth.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.661
- I know this man.
- You do?

25:02.752 --> 25:05.619
Yes. His name is Ben.
I saw him working
at the aquarium.

25:05.713 --> 25:08.250
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

25:15.598 --> 25:17.634
So, why didn’t you
clock in, Ben?

25:17.767 --> 25:19.974
Probably ’cause
I wasn’t working.
Really?

Right. That night.
Just a routine night
at the aquarium.

A man gets murdered
and then he gets fed
to the sharks.

I wasn’t supposed
to work that night,

25:39.038 --> 25:40.903

25:41.040 --> 25:43.281
I didn’t clock in using
my own card. That happens.
It doesn’t matter.

25:43.376 --> 25:45.287
The fact is you were there.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.835
So let’s start this all over again,
shall we, okay?

25:47.922 --> 25:51.665
Here’s a check made out to you.
Ben Marcus— that’s you, right?

the day after the murder.

- Signed by one Dmitri Vladov.

26:02.770 --> 26:05.352
Oh, man. Okay.

26:05.440 --> 26:09.683

Russian mobster type.

But if I tell you,

26:21.038 --> 26:23.199
Vladov will kill me.

26:23.291 --> 26:26.408
Okay, I want a lawyer.

No.

Yeah.

Vladov the Impaler

with a check?

26:40.349 --> 26:42.260
Yeah. I mean, why would
Vladov hire an amateur?

26:42.351 --> 26:44.933
And pay by check.
That’s not a good sign
for law enforcement.

26:45.021 --> 26:48.013
That’s not a good sign
for culture as a whole.
You know what we ought to do?

like you’re stalling

26:54.655 --> 26:56.987
I am stalling, yes.
Why?

Why go out on a limb
when you know
it’s gonna break?

26:58.743 --> 27:01.405
Vladov’s under
surveillance by about
five federal agencies.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.448
Nothing ever happens.
So how’s he get away with it?

27:03.539 --> 27:06.451
- What’s the Russian word
for “Teflon”?
- I don’t know. Teflon/stan?

27:06.542 --> 27:08.453

on 50 charges—

RICO, prostitution.

He has a brilliant trick
to keep himself out of prison.

27:15.468 --> 27:17.925
What’s that?
He denies doing it.

27:18.012 --> 27:20.128

when he denies something,
it’s his way of saying “yes.”

it’s a fact that

add blue dye
to tankers of clear alcohol
and import it as glass cleaner,

the booze as vodka.

28:56.986 --> 28:59.523

No. No blue shark.

32:09.053 --> 32:11.886
Well, that’s not possible.
How would those embryonic cells
get into the tank?

It’s a closed system.
They weren’t in the tank.
They were in the victim.

32:15.684 --> 32:20.974
The embryonic cells
of a blue shark can be injected
between the vertebrae...

there’s a scientific
explanation for this.

it still holds water.
We ’re on a tight budget
around here.

This explains the cleft fracture
on the victim’s styloid process.

33:20.332 --> 33:25.201
- Uh, you lost me, Bones.
- The lionfish protects itself
with venomous spines...

33:25.296 --> 33:29.710
containing the same neurotoxin
that stunned our victim prior to his death.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.381
- So no hypodermic needle?
- No.

33:31.468 --> 33:34.084

all coming into contact
with the victim’s face
at the same time.

33:37.558 --> 33:40.015
So this fish
stabbed him in the eye?

33:40.102 --> 33:41.967
That is consistent
with the wounds, yes.

33:42.104 --> 33:44.015

gained access to the back area
of the aquarium...

34:05.961 --> 34:08.043

most venomous fish...

34:18.891 --> 34:21.348
and was taking
a look at it from above
the surface of the water...

34:21.435 --> 34:24.927
when someone forcefully
pushed his head down
into the tank,

causing a cleft fracture
of the styloid process.

This man died
of a lionfish swirly.
[Clark] Yeah.

34:36.367 --> 34:40.326
Now, several
of the venomous spines
penetrated the eye area.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.323
A few broke
and remained embedded.

and possibly unconscious,

34:45.834 --> 34:47.916
it was very easy
to drag him off
to the big tank nearby.

34:48.003 --> 34:51.040
Unconscious underwater;
he was dead
with his ﬁrst breath.

34:51.131 --> 34:53.338
And those ﬁsh
tore him apart.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.963

holds true— eat or be eaten.

Jazz Gunn ﬂew to Brazil
every siX months.

35:02.935 --> 35:06.553
He had surgery
at a special clinic in
a small town called ltamaraca.

35:06.647 --> 35:10.606
That would be consistent
with the maintenance injections
required semiannually,

35:10.693 --> 35:12.934
although, Itamaraca, Brazil,
is a long way to go to get them.

35:13.028 --> 35:14.939
Well, he’s gotta
keep up the front—

35:15.030 --> 35:18.648
tell everyone he’s going for
another swim in the sea, right?

35:18.742 --> 35:22.530
But guess who else paid a visit
to ltamaraca this year?

35:23.956 --> 35:28.791
So Brazil’s a pretty
expensive vacation
for a schoolteacher.

35:28.877 --> 35:30.868
I love to travel.

35:30.963 --> 35:34.706
To the very same beach
where Jazz Gunn claimed
to have been healed by the sea?

35:37.720 --> 35:40.006
How many of his seminars
did you attend?

35:41.390 --> 35:43.381
The FBI. will find out.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.057
You said you didn’t know
who Jazz Gunn was.

35:47.521 --> 35:49.512
I went to nine of his seminars.

I have fibromyalgia.

[Sniffling]

And that bastard convinced me
that if I just faced my fears,

36:05.914 --> 36:10.203
that magically, all this pain
would just disappear.

36:10.294 --> 36:13.536
- He lied.
- So you brought a group
of fourth graders along...

36:13.630 --> 36:15.837
as an alibi for murder?

36:15.924 --> 36:18.586
No. It was a coincidence.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.760
He took me back to see
this poisonous ﬁsh.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.509
“Come face your fears,” he said.

Last thing he should’ve
said to me right then.

He might have been
on to something, that bastard.

36:32.107 --> 36:37.602
Because ever since
I shoved his lying face
into that poisonous fish,

36:37.696 --> 36:39.778
I haven’t felt any pain.

36:51.627 --> 36:54.369

coffee with Andrew.

I insisted that | see you socially.
