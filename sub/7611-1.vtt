00:49.949 --> 00:51.678
Okay, let's get you some bananas.

00:51.851 --> 00:54.547
You haven't touched your cereal.
I thought you were hungry.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.245
- Good.
- So, what's up for today?

00:56.823 --> 00:59.849
Well, today, we gotta give
the caterer the last check.

01:00.026 --> 01:01.789
Go over the decorations
at the church.

01:01.961 --> 01:03.952
Find out why my dress
is gonna cost more.

01:04.129 --> 01:06.792
I didn't want lace on the bust,
instead they doubled it.

01:06.966 --> 01:08.297
How much more?

01:09.302 --> 01:10.326
Six-fifty.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.366
Six-fifty, that's a lot of money.

01:14.541 --> 01:17.009
Mikey, come here.

01:17.177 --> 01:20.237
Six-fifty, what do you think of that?
Are you sure?

01:20.580 --> 01:21.638
Yeah.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.283
- Man says go for it.
- Really?

01:24.451 --> 01:27.215
It's your wedding dress, baby.
Mikey wants Mom to look hot.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.947
- So do I.
- Major brownie points.

01:37.497 --> 01:40.125
Hey, hand me that, Manny?
Manny...? Thanks.

01:44.504 --> 01:47.530
- What time we got, 4:30?
- On the dot, Wade.

01:47.707 --> 01:49.698
- Checks, boys.
- I'm down with that, man.

01:49.876 --> 01:51.434
Time to get paid.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.517
Baby.

02:08.428 --> 02:11.864
- We got the business loan.
- Shut up. Are you kidding?

02:12.632 --> 02:14.691
Oh, baby, that's so great.

02:15.435 --> 02:18.233
I can hire four or five more guys.

02:18.438 --> 02:20.338
I get Joe to run a second crew.

02:20.507 --> 02:23.067
Do another 30 grand this year.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.902
I'm so proud of you, baby.

02:27.347 --> 02:29.713
You built up this entire business
all on your own.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.511
No, we did.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.944
Somebody's in the house.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.415
We gotta get Mikey, quiet.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.296
Stay with me.

03:31.110 --> 03:34.136
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

03:34.647 --> 03:36.012
What's wrong?

03:36.182 --> 03:37.547
Everything's okay.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.151
- Everything's okay.
- What's happening?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.311
Everything's okay.
Just go back to sleep.

03:42.488 --> 03:44.456
Stay in this room.

04:03.610 --> 04:04.907
Wade!

04:08.014 --> 04:09.572
Stop. What are you doing?

04:09.749 --> 04:11.307
- Back off.
- I said stop.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.011
Damn it.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.226
Oh, God.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.373
Wade, what's happening?

04:38.544 --> 04:40.569
Stay in the house!

04:40.747 --> 04:42.908
Stay in the house!

04:43.316 --> 04:45.181
Stay alive, stay alive.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.444
Please don't die.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.351
Jesus Christ.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.817
Motherfucker, I did that.

04:56.062 --> 04:58.860
Wade, I'm calling 911.

05:32.598 --> 05:35.192
Can she at least put him to bed,
please?

05:49.649 --> 05:51.674
We didn't find a weapon anywhere.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.115
He did have your wallet in his hand.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.482
Maybe you thought that if you...

05:56.656 --> 05:59.454
No. What I saw was,
he was reaching for something.

05:59.625 --> 06:01.286
I thought it was a gun or weapon.

06:01.461 --> 06:04.294
I told him to stop,
he kept turning around, okay?

06:04.464 --> 06:06.557
So I aimed the bat,
then he started to duck.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.497
Look, if he was still in the house
when it happened...

06:09.669 --> 06:13.230
...or if he was at least armed, we could
make a case for self-defense.

06:13.406 --> 06:17.172
But the problem is, he was no longer
a threat when he left the house.

06:17.343 --> 06:21.006
Yet you proceeded to chase him
outside with a bat.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.842
- Killed him with one swing.
- Wait a second, please.

06:24.016 --> 06:25.745
- l... It was an accident.
- I'm sorry.

06:25.918 --> 06:28.751
We're gonna have to place you
under arrest for murder.

06:28.921 --> 06:30.946
Murder?

06:31.991 --> 06:34.653
Are you out of your minds?
The guy was robbing us.

06:34.827 --> 06:37.227
- He was in my child's room!
- Ma'am, I understand...

06:37.397 --> 06:40.161
What was Wade supposed to do?
Wait for the guy to shoot him?

06:40.333 --> 06:44.099
No, what he should have done
is stay inside and dial 911.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.732
Face the wall.
Hands over your head.

07:22.141 --> 07:23.802
Hands up on the wall.

07:38.558 --> 07:40.150
<i>Are you HIV positive?</i>

07:40.326 --> 07:41.953
No.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.171
Don't touch this button
unless it's an emergency.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.909
Come back up in here.

08:06.919 --> 08:10.150
You know what I'm saying?
Don't come back up in here.

08:39.684 --> 08:43.280
You eyeball me, motherfucker, huh?
You eyeballing me?

08:44.790 --> 08:46.451
You motherfucker.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.450
I see, you're a bitch, huh?

08:49.629 --> 08:51.494
I'm gonna clean your mouth.
Suck my dick.

08:51.664 --> 08:53.154
Fuck you!

09:01.908 --> 09:04.342
Fight in 33! Fight in 33!

09:07.613 --> 09:10.446
- All of you get against the wall.
- Crew resistance.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.607
I'll fucking kill you.

09:12.785 --> 09:14.616
Against the wall, everybody.

09:18.457 --> 09:21.255
- I'll kill you, boy.
- All this started from you looking, man.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.227
You're dead, motherfucker.
You're so dead.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.223
Keep your hands on your heads.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.613
You down for yours, holmes?

09:53.659 --> 09:55.126
We gonna have a wreck in here?

09:55.761 --> 09:57.661
- No.
- Good.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.492
You just clean up the pad
on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

10:00.666 --> 10:03.032
And keep all your shit on your bunk.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.990
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.064
Baby, what happened to your face?

10:35.201 --> 10:36.361
I got jumped.

10:36.535 --> 10:39.470
- Well, we gotta tell somebody.
- It won't help, Laura.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.030
Are you okay?

10:41.440 --> 10:43.067
How's Mikey?

10:43.309 --> 10:44.367
He's scared.

10:44.543 --> 10:47.842
He just keeps asking for you, Wade.
I didn't know what to tell him.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.346
So I told him that you went on a trip.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.350
It doesn't help that we're staying
with my mother.

10:53.919 --> 10:54.943
Great.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.555
Wade, I didn't feel safe
at the house by myself.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.623
Everything's gonna be okay.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.192
I promise you.

11:03.295 --> 11:04.819
We have to get you out of here.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.562
They're gonna give me
a public defender.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.531
Let me see what they say.
We'll go from there.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.881
I'm Mara Reid.
I'll be representing you.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.576
Hi. Nice to meet you.

11:28.654 --> 11:31.020
This part's a formality.
Judge will arraign you.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.125
Set bail at a million, which is
mandatory for a murder charge.

11:34.293 --> 11:36.523
Do you have a million dollars
in collateral?

11:36.696 --> 11:37.958
No, not even close.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.621
Anybody willing to help out
and co-sign? Your parents?

11:41.233 --> 11:42.962
My parents died nine years ago.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.702
I'll do what I can
to move things along.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.917
Yeah!

12:03.489 --> 12:04.922
State of revolution!

12:05.091 --> 12:06.615
Revolution!

12:10.096 --> 12:11.893
Come on in.
Come on, motherfucker.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.328
- Get in.
- Fuck, yeah.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.964
What are we gonna be?
We'll see.

12:18.137 --> 12:20.196
We'll see.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.838
Did Smith say
why they were rioting?

12:23.008 --> 12:26.500
No. It's like he got everyone riled up
just for the hell of it.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.443
Now, with John,
there's always a reason.

12:30.182 --> 12:33.743
Come and destroy me.
Break the illusion to pieces.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.021
You sure know how to stir up
a pile of shit, don't you, boy?

12:41.193 --> 12:44.356
Well, you know me, Gordon,
always one for live entertainment.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.294
They mean business this time,
John.

12:48.634 --> 12:51.262
They wanna stick you
in the hole forever.

12:51.737 --> 12:54.365
Now, you and I both know
you don't want that.

12:54.540 --> 12:58.169
My Maria
would have been 27 yesterday.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.611
Is that what this is all about?

13:03.949 --> 13:06.315
You gotta stop living in the past,
John.

13:06.485 --> 13:09.045
Hey, I am the past.

13:09.221 --> 13:10.586
I should've been a dead man.

13:10.756 --> 13:13.748
Instead, they turned me
into the walking fucking dead.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.490
All right, look.

13:19.665 --> 13:22.395
I'm gonna get them to transfer you.
Give you a fresh start.

13:22.568 --> 13:27.005
But after that, I am all out of favors.
You understand me?

13:28.107 --> 13:30.200
Well, I guess it's...

13:30.376 --> 13:32.469
...on to the next chapter,
huh, Gordon?

13:34.880 --> 13:36.541
But then again, maybe not.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.314
Just behave yourself, would you?

13:53.199 --> 13:54.860
Come on.

13:57.036 --> 13:58.298
What the hell's going on?

13:58.470 --> 14:00.529
My preliminary was supposed
to be weeks ago.

14:00.706 --> 14:03.436
I asked for more time
to build your case.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.533
But I got some good news.

14:05.711 --> 14:08.305
The DA's sympathetic
to your situation. He is.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.745
He's agreed to reduce if you plead
no contest forthwith commitment...

14:11.917 --> 14:14.010
Hold on. What does that mean?

14:14.887 --> 14:16.081
If you plead no contest...

14:16.255 --> 14:18.780
...he'll reduce the charge
to involuntary manslaughter.

14:18.958 --> 14:22.052
You get no more than three years,
you start serving it immediately.

14:22.228 --> 14:24.890
If you stay out of trouble,
you'll only do half.

14:25.297 --> 14:27.356
Hell, you've already got
95 days time served.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.262
You'd be out in less than 15 months.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.027
And what other options do I have?

14:31.203 --> 14:34.263
We go to a jury trial which will
take a year to get to anyway...

14:34.440 --> 14:36.704
...and they try you
for second-degree murder.

14:36.876 --> 14:40.368
It carries a mandatory sentence
of 15 years to life.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.411
Look, take the deal.

14:42.581 --> 14:44.481
We won't do better.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.109
Your Honor, the defendant
is willing to plead guilty...

14:48.287 --> 14:51.779
...to an amended count
of involuntary manslaughter.

14:51.957 --> 14:55.415
We've agreed to a three-year sentence
in state prison...

14:55.594 --> 14:57.061
...with a forthwith commitment.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.995
The 97 days Mr. Porter has served
in county jail...

15:01.166 --> 15:03.225
...would be credited
to his overall sentence.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.426
Mr. Porter.

15:05.604 --> 15:08.129
<i>Do you understand</i>
<i>that this can be used against you...</i>

15:08.307 --> 15:10.366
<i>... in any future violations</i>
<i>or convictions...</i>

15:10.542 --> 15:13.272
<i>... resulting in additional time</i>
<i>added to your sentence?</i>

15:13.445 --> 15:14.503
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

15:14.680 --> 15:16.705
<i>And Mr. Porter, do you understand...</i>

15:16.882 --> 15:19.749
<i>... that you'll be banned from buying</i>
<i>or possessing firearms...</i>

15:19.919 --> 15:23.013
<i>... that until your sentence</i>
<i>and parole term is served...</i>

15:23.188 --> 15:26.919
<i>... you cannot vote or leave the county</i>
<i>without authorization.</i>

15:27.092 --> 15:29.788
- <i>Do you understand these terms?</i>
- <i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

15:29.962 --> 15:33.363
Therefore, Mr. Porter,
for your conviction in count one...

15:33.532 --> 15:36.695
...this court sentences you
to three years in state prison...

15:36.869 --> 15:40.635
...with a credit of 97 days
already served.

15:40.806 --> 15:44.139
- Good luck to you, sir.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

16:03.195 --> 16:07.029
Yo, man, we caught the chain to the
motherfucking madhouse, homey.

16:07.199 --> 16:09.997
It's like this place
is always cracking off.

16:11.503 --> 16:14.131
Yo, my name is Jake.
They call me Snowman.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.137
- What's yours?
- Wade.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.832
Wade.

16:20.245 --> 16:23.874
Yo, man, know who that fucker is,
Wade?

16:24.049 --> 16:25.983
White dude with the mustache?

16:26.385 --> 16:28.410
That's Danny Samson.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.282
Dude's in the Brand.

16:30.456 --> 16:33.687
He should be locked up
at the SHU at the Bay right now...

16:33.859 --> 16:36.327
...but, like, the mad dog's genius,
you know?

16:36.495 --> 16:39.760
He flies under the radar.
He's like a sleeper.

16:40.232 --> 16:42.792
No letters, no AB tats, nothing.

16:42.968 --> 16:45.095
Cops can't fucking validate him.

16:45.270 --> 16:47.238
What's the Brand?

16:47.940 --> 16:50.500
It's the Aryan Brotherhood, man.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.871
Yo, you better figure
your shit out fast, homey.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.551
- So, what time's the game tonight?
- Five.

17:07.726 --> 17:08.852
What are you doing?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.223
Hiding from Jill Sanders.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.624
She wants to fight me...

17:13.866 --> 17:15.231
...but she's a girl.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.593
Which one? The one in the white?

17:20.271 --> 17:22.069
Well, she is big.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.435
Yeah, she's huge.

17:24.943 --> 17:28.777
Well, you tell her
you're not gonna fight, period.

17:28.947 --> 17:30.744
So she might as well just let it go.

17:31.884 --> 17:37.789
And if that doesn't work, then,
you know, just kick her in the nuts.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.959
Give me a hug.
Get out of here, man.

17:42.127 --> 17:43.560
Come on.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.558
I'll see you later.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.600
Hey, Todd.
You know I was kidding, right?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.503
The weak are the ones
who can't avoid trouble.

17:53.005 --> 17:56.736
- I know, Dad.
- All right. See you later.

17:57.976 --> 18:00.069
Oh, man.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.696
Yo, that fucking toad's eyeballing you,
homey.

18:29.708 --> 18:33.269
Got into a fight with him at county.
Didn't think it was that big a deal.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.414
Shit, man, everything in here
is a big fucking deal.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.345
Look at someone the wrong way,
it's on.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.542
You fucking don't look at them,
it's on.

18:41.086 --> 18:42.485
Do yourself a favor.

18:42.654 --> 18:44.519
When we get down to yard...

18:44.690 --> 18:46.851
...get down for your fucking race,
wood.

18:47.025 --> 18:49.220
Sling with the first monkey
who opens his mouth.

18:49.394 --> 18:52.261
I'll back you up.
Don't you fucking worry about it.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.320
- It's jumping off.
- What?

19:43.782 --> 19:47.274
We have a major 415 in the back
of the bus. Multiple inmates involved.

19:47.452 --> 19:49.852
Have an ERT unit dispatched
and ready.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.962
- Oh, fuck!
- They got the motherfucking goons.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.376
You found it under your seat.
Don't say shit.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.451
- Rats get whacked.
- What are you doing?

20:54.620 --> 20:57.453
Sit down and shut up. Now!

20:58.023 --> 21:00.150
Heads down! Now!

21:00.325 --> 21:01.917
And stay down...

21:02.094 --> 21:03.459
...stay quiet.

21:03.629 --> 21:08.589
Or I'll CN gas the whole fucking bus.
Let you choke on it!

21:28.854 --> 21:30.515
Send him to the infirmary.

21:30.689 --> 21:33.817
Throw the rest in the hole
till we figure this shit out.

21:33.992 --> 21:36.654
- Team, get them off the bus.
- Get your asses up.

21:36.828 --> 21:39.695
- Let's go off the bus. Let's go.
- Let's go. Hurry up.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.165
It wasn't my weapon, I swear.

21:42.334 --> 21:45.326
- Save that shit.
- It was under my seat.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.586
Jesus Christ.

22:04.289 --> 22:06.018
What am I gonna do?

22:07.259 --> 22:09.284
Oh, man.

22:11.797 --> 22:13.458
Hey!

22:13.899 --> 22:16.766
- Hey, guard!
- Shut the fuck up!

22:19.471 --> 22:21.098
Guard, please.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.331
Hello?

22:22.507 --> 22:25.738
What am I gonna do?
One fucking phone call!

22:25.911 --> 22:28.505
Damn it, this is fucking crazy.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.614
Motherfucker, come on!

22:30.782 --> 22:32.079
Please, God. Please.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.684
I shouldn't even fucking be in here!

22:41.193 --> 22:43.093
Get your head off the ground, fish.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.630
Look at me in my eyes
when I talk to you.

22:45.797 --> 22:49.563
We know you didn't stick that inmate.
Tell us who did it and you're out of it.

22:49.735 --> 22:50.793
I don't know.

22:50.969 --> 22:53.233
I found the weapon under my seat.

22:53.405 --> 22:56.203
- Somebody must've slid it on the floor.
- Bullshit.

22:56.475 --> 22:57.806
We know it was Danny Samson.

22:57.976 --> 22:59.637
Just admit it.

22:59.811 --> 23:01.278
If you know,
why do you need me?

23:01.446 --> 23:02.470
Son of a bitch!

23:02.647 --> 23:04.638
- I will put you in the hole...
- Come on.

23:04.816 --> 23:07.046
- till you're fucking an old man.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.243
- You hear me?
- Wait.

23:11.289 --> 23:14.554
Let me tell you about that piece of shit
you're covering for.

23:15.127 --> 23:18.824
You think he'll give you love for this,
get yourself some protection, right?

23:19.231 --> 23:22.291
Samson's a stone-cold killer
who could give a fuck about you.

23:22.701 --> 23:24.692
Look what he did
to one of his own race.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.100
You don't mean shit to him.
Look at me, boy.

23:28.907 --> 23:32.308
When the time comes,
he will whack you.

23:32.477 --> 23:33.808
Protect his own ass.

23:33.979 --> 23:36.038
Is that who you looking to back?

23:36.982 --> 23:40.850
That inmate that got stuck in the neck,
he's in critical condition.

23:41.019 --> 23:44.785
If he dies, you're going down
for accessory to murder.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.689
- I don't know. I don't know. I'm sorry.
- Fuck it.

23:54.699 --> 23:56.860
He wants to soldier up
with his new homeys.

23:57.035 --> 23:58.525
Let him.

24:00.205 --> 24:02.435
Congratulations, Porter.

24:03.542 --> 24:05.772
You're on your way to the SHU.

24:06.511 --> 24:08.206
That's my motherfucking house.

24:10.849 --> 24:12.009
Let's go.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.728
Come on. Come on, bitch!
Come get some.

24:41.813 --> 24:44.043
Open A Section.

24:48.086 --> 24:49.110
Step inside.

24:51.189 --> 24:52.986
One, two, three...

24:53.158 --> 24:54.853
Welcome home.

24:55.126 --> 24:57.492
One, two, three.

25:09.608 --> 25:11.439
Look how lucky you are.

25:11.610 --> 25:13.202
Against the wall.

25:14.479 --> 25:15.969
What's up?

25:16.147 --> 25:17.444
Crack 13.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.880
Do not move, there's a fucking gun
trained on your head.

25:22.053 --> 25:23.987
Move to the right.

25:24.155 --> 25:25.850
Step inside.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.283
Close 13.

25:29.427 --> 25:31.292
Get something straight.
We're hands-on.

25:31.463 --> 25:33.397
You'll receive no warning shots.

25:36.401 --> 25:39.063
I'll uncuff your first hand.
Grip the port. Understand?

25:39.237 --> 25:40.568
Yes.

25:41.239 --> 25:43.503
Grab the food port.
I'll uncuff your second hand.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.506
Step away from the door.
You understand?

25:45.677 --> 25:47.042
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.942
Step inside.

25:51.416 --> 25:54.442
You're in here 23l7.
Get an hour yard time a day.

25:54.619 --> 25:56.450
Three showers a week. That's it.

25:56.621 --> 25:59.681
- Welcome to the SHU.
- Sixteen.

26:00.225 --> 26:04.924
Seventeen, 18, 19.

26:07.866 --> 26:10.460
Warden Reed at Salinas
speaks highly of you.

26:11.036 --> 26:13.129
Adapted well, led by example.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.637
The Army taught me a lot, sir.

26:16.541 --> 26:17.803
Rangers, huh?

26:17.976 --> 26:21.139
- Shock and Awe, Iraqi Freedom?
- No, sir. I just missed it.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.372
Did most of my tour in Korea
in the DMZ.

26:23.548 --> 26:26.176
- Any action?
- It was like watching paint dry.

26:26.351 --> 26:27.943
NK'd look at us.
We'd look at them.

26:28.119 --> 26:31.646
Maybe one of us would give the other
the finger. That's about it.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.424
You'll see more than that
working in the SHU.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.026
That'd suit me just fine, sir.

26:36.194 --> 26:39.459
Good. Give me a minute with
the warden. I'll introduce you around.

26:39.631 --> 26:40.791
Sure.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.391
- Thank you, sir.
- Collins.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.538
So, what's on your mind, Bill?

26:48.707 --> 26:51.540
- Hear they're transferring John Smith.
- Day after tomorrow.

26:51.710 --> 26:54.235
We're putting him
in Protective Custody with Manson?

26:54.412 --> 26:55.970
We'll put him in here in the SHU.

26:56.147 --> 26:57.171
Seriously, come on.

26:57.349 --> 27:00.785
He's caused a wreck in every house
he's been in. Better off isolating him.

27:00.952 --> 27:04.718
I'm not adding to that son of a bitch's
celebrity. We put him there.

27:04.889 --> 27:07.653
- That's what the SHU is for.
- Yes, sir.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.332
<i>Porter, yard time!</i>

27:21.006 --> 27:24.169
Let's go. Strip down. Pass your
clothes and shoes through the port.

27:24.342 --> 27:26.333
Anything sharp in there?

27:26.511 --> 27:28.979
- Nope.
- If I get cut I'm gonna fucking hurt you.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.876
Run your fingers through your hair.

27:31.916 --> 27:33.884
Open your mouth.

27:34.185 --> 27:37.086
Lift up your tongue,
roll it side to side.

27:37.255 --> 27:39.587
Run your finger
along your gum line.

27:39.758 --> 27:41.316
Show me behind your left ear.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.427
Behind your right.

27:43.695 --> 27:46.186
Show me your pits. Arms up.

27:47.132 --> 27:48.599
Lift your nut sack.

27:49.768 --> 27:51.395
Lift your dick.

27:52.237 --> 27:53.704
Turn around.

27:55.106 --> 27:56.767
Lift your right foot.

27:57.242 --> 27:59.005
Wiggle your toes.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.735
Move your left foot.

28:00.912 --> 28:02.379
Wiggle your toes.

28:02.547 --> 28:05.038
Listen carefully,
I want you to squat three times.

28:05.216 --> 28:08.049
On the third squat...
Stop, stop, stop.

28:08.219 --> 28:10.346
You squat three times.
Listen to my voice.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.355
On the third squat, I want you
to spread your cheeks, cough.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.015
- Go.
- Okay.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.826
You're good. Get dressed.

28:25.837 --> 28:27.464
Let's go.

28:33.144 --> 28:34.634
Fucking fish. Jesus.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.080
Come on.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.480
Face the wall.

28:41.653 --> 28:43.450
Okay, I'm just buttoning...

28:52.497 --> 28:54.089
Step away.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.458
Crack 13.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.429
Back up.

29:03.208 --> 29:04.641
Close 13.

29:14.119 --> 29:17.020
Stop right there. Close side port.

29:20.024 --> 29:21.355
Hands through the port.

29:21.526 --> 29:24.120
I release this first cuff,
grab the top of the port.

29:25.797 --> 29:28.789
I'll release the second cuff,
step away from the door.

29:30.835 --> 29:32.393
Get in the yard.

30:13.044 --> 30:15.478
Fucking told you, man.
Gladiator school's on.

30:15.647 --> 30:16.671
I got 10 on Gonzales.

30:16.848 --> 30:18.907
I got that.
Williams' gonna fuck him up.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.311
Come on. Come on.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.245
Oh, no. Get up, get up, man. Get up.

30:24.088 --> 30:26.648
We keep it interesting.
Assholes will fight anyway.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.020
- Who you got?
- I'm with you. Gonzales.

30:29.194 --> 30:31.094
- Attaboy. Sergeant?
- I got Williams.

30:31.262 --> 30:32.729
Of course you do.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.048
Shit.

30:58.823 --> 31:00.017
I'm <i>el fuego.</i>

31:00.191 --> 31:02.216
Fucking Gonzales.
Pepper the asshole.

31:13.204 --> 31:14.694
Fuck!

31:14.873 --> 31:16.864
The fight was over!

31:17.909 --> 31:20.070
Beat your ass,
Uncle Tom house nigger!

31:20.612 --> 31:24.048
Yeah, you, Jackson! You ain't shit
without that gat. You know it.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.911
Put Williams out first. Alone.

31:29.020 --> 31:31.716
Think I'm scared of some hole time?
Fuck you and the hole.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.949
Who said you was going to the hole?

31:34.125 --> 31:37.356
Put him in the review room.
Uncuff him.

31:39.764 --> 31:42.756
- Lieutenant.
- Yup.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.803
I believe you're done now.

31:46.204 --> 31:48.604
What the fuck is up now? What?

31:49.674 --> 31:50.766
You said, nigger, right?

31:53.411 --> 31:55.777
That's all you came with?
Who the nigger now?

32:00.351 --> 32:01.443
Put him in the hole, LT?

32:01.619 --> 32:02.847
Throw him in his cell.

32:03.021 --> 32:05.285
Let everybody see it.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.753
Still the reigning champ.

32:14.332 --> 32:16.300
Everybody see this?

32:34.118 --> 32:37.610
SHU inmates can't have packages
until next quarter.

32:54.339 --> 32:56.739
I'm wearing an underwire bra.

32:57.141 --> 32:59.405
We're gonna have
to strip-search you.

33:00.945 --> 33:02.503
Please take off your shirt.

33:17.128 --> 33:19.722
I need you to take off your bra too.

33:38.082 --> 33:39.106
Raise your arms.

33:48.559 --> 33:49.583
Thank you.

34:00.805 --> 34:02.329
Hey, baby.

34:05.143 --> 34:06.269
What's wrong?

34:08.179 --> 34:10.875
It's nothing, baby. I'm fine.

34:11.215 --> 34:15.583
Jesus Christ, Wade, they wouldn't let
me see or talk to you for three months.

34:15.753 --> 34:19.985
Then I get this phone call saying
that you're in a security housing unit.

34:20.158 --> 34:22.058
What's going on?

34:23.161 --> 34:25.219
- Just got caught up in something.
- Something?

34:25.797 --> 34:28.163
That's it?
That's all you're gonna say?

34:28.331 --> 34:31.927
Yeah, well, they took away 90 days
of my good time.

34:32.103 --> 34:33.797
Why? Wade, what did you do?

34:33.971 --> 34:35.438
I didn't do anything. I swear.

34:35.606 --> 34:37.904
You must have.
Why would they be punishing you?

34:38.076 --> 34:39.976
Things aren't that simple in here,
Laura.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.844
I can't explain it to you.
You have to trust me.

34:43.014 --> 34:44.606
Please.

34:45.983 --> 34:47.348
How's Mikey?

34:48.018 --> 34:49.246
He's fine.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.012
Will you bring him next time?

34:51.188 --> 34:52.246
I gotta see him.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.349
I will. He misses you.

34:57.962 --> 34:59.452
Wade, we're out of money.

35:00.164 --> 35:02.428
Mortgage is due.
I've been trying to find a job.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.626
- I can't find one that will pay it.
- Job? What about Mikey?

35:05.803 --> 35:07.361
My mom's gonna watch him.

35:07.538 --> 35:09.335
I thought we were
nine months ahead.

35:09.507 --> 35:12.601
We were, and then the wedding.
I didn't get all our deposits back.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.342
All right.

35:17.515 --> 35:19.278
Just use the checks
from the SBA loan.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.680
That'll get you by
until I figure something out.

35:21.853 --> 35:24.913
- No, baby, that's your business.
- The hell with my business.

35:25.089 --> 35:27.353
I can't think about that right now.

35:27.558 --> 35:29.185
Just use the checks.

35:52.049 --> 35:53.380
Open A Section.

35:56.988 --> 36:01.288
Good to see you, wood.
Anything you need, you let me know.

36:01.459 --> 36:04.622
I got you, Smith. That's right, wood.
I know who you are, homey.

36:04.795 --> 36:08.128
Porter, get your fish ass on the floor
facing the wall.

36:08.299 --> 36:10.290
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.

36:10.468 --> 36:12.265
You hear me talking to you, Porter?

36:12.436 --> 36:14.597
Crack 13!

36:29.987 --> 36:31.716
Letters from John Henry Smith.

36:32.256 --> 36:35.555
Posted right there on the Internet
for everyone to see.

36:35.893 --> 36:37.861
"Any student of philosophy
will tell you...

36:38.029 --> 36:41.089
...the truth about the human condition
today lies in our ability...

36:41.265 --> 36:43.290
...to face things
we loathe about ourselves.

36:43.467 --> 36:46.903
To comprehend human altruism
and common decency."

36:47.071 --> 36:48.129
Blah, blah, blah.

36:48.606 --> 36:50.767
Does anybody buy this shit?

36:51.475 --> 36:53.602
Now, I remember
when I first heard about you.

36:53.778 --> 36:56.770
You took out what,
16, 17 people, right?

36:56.948 --> 36:58.540
Personally...

36:58.716 --> 37:00.946
...I think you're a fucking hypocrite.

37:01.118 --> 37:02.915
Writing this shit.

37:03.087 --> 37:06.215
Expecting people to what,
get something out of it?

37:07.058 --> 37:08.889
Fucking asshole lifers.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.891
Find religion
or wanna change the world.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.622
Tookie and his fucking kids books.
And now you.

37:21.305 --> 37:23.364
Found this in your property.

37:24.642 --> 37:27.634
Family is everything, isn't it?

37:28.946 --> 37:31.176
I'm gonna hang on to this for you.

37:31.482 --> 37:33.450
Keep it safe.

37:35.886 --> 37:38.753
You pull any shit in my house...

37:39.023 --> 37:42.789
...and I will show you
what true fucking vengeance is.

37:43.861 --> 37:45.726
We clear?

37:48.833 --> 37:50.960
Close 13.

37:58.976 --> 38:00.534
Turn around.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.971
I'll release this cuff,
grip the food port.

38:06.417 --> 38:07.714
Step away.

38:09.987 --> 38:11.887
Porter, you can get up.

38:12.757 --> 38:15.055
Smith, you got some fresh meat.

38:20.164 --> 38:21.893
You wanna fuck or fight?

38:23.200 --> 38:24.599
Neither.

38:24.769 --> 38:26.566
Keep it that way.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.296
I like this bunk.

38:30.408 --> 38:31.932
Okay.

38:46.023 --> 38:47.388
Here you go.

38:48.893 --> 38:51.885
You jerk off, face the wall.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.627
You break wind...

38:54.799 --> 38:56.664
...put your ass to the door.

38:57.501 --> 39:00.629
If you shit and piss, in the can.

39:00.905 --> 39:03.806
Do all that,
we'll get along famously.

39:25.096 --> 39:26.461
Smith! Porter!

39:26.630 --> 39:28.564
Yard time!

39:32.536 --> 39:35.130
Thirty-three. Down.

39:35.306 --> 39:36.705
- Thirty-four.
- Down.

39:36.874 --> 39:39.206
- Thirty-five.
- Down.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.311
- Thirty-six.
- Down.

39:41.746 --> 39:42.770
Thirty-seven.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.779
- Who the fuck is this fool?
- No, no, he...

39:52.356 --> 39:55.257
How you doing, Smith?
Anything you need, bro.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.923
The southerners are backing him?

39:58.095 --> 40:00.427
I heard he's got history
with the shot callers.

40:14.945 --> 40:16.572
How you doing?

40:16.747 --> 40:19.147
- This the guy, man. This is Wade.
- Hey.

40:19.316 --> 40:20.806
Bodie. County skinhead.

40:20.985 --> 40:22.282
Hey. Wade. Santa Clarita.

40:23.320 --> 40:24.947
Fucking welcome to the jungle, huh?

40:25.122 --> 40:27.989
- Motherfucking SHU's no joke, is it?
- Yeah, thanks.

40:28.159 --> 40:31.651
Yeah, you should be fucking thanking
me, man. Samson says you're solid.

40:31.829 --> 40:34.093
So you two are Aryan Brotherhood
then?

40:34.265 --> 40:36.631
No, man. We're the ones putting
the work in though.

40:36.801 --> 40:38.098
Earning our fucking letters.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.930
Why'd that guy get stabbed?

40:40.271 --> 40:43.502
That was a drug debt, man.
Fucking needle Nazi owed, taxed.

40:43.674 --> 40:45.801
Keep handling business
and do as you're told...

40:45.976 --> 40:48.604
...and we'll get down for you.
Trust me, you'll need it.

40:49.046 --> 40:50.638
Thanks.

40:59.890 --> 41:02.484
That who you're headed back to?

41:04.728 --> 41:06.195
Yeah.

41:06.831 --> 41:09.595
We were supposed to be married
four months ago.

41:21.679 --> 41:23.943
What's your boy's name?

41:24.648 --> 41:26.309
Michael.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.244
Looks like you.

41:29.954 --> 41:32.582
And the eyes and the mouth.

41:32.756 --> 41:36.590
Fortunately,
my Maria took after her mother.

41:38.429 --> 41:40.590
You got a picture of them?

41:41.999 --> 41:45.264
You saw them take
the last one I had.

41:48.138 --> 41:50.003
Sorry.

41:50.741 --> 41:52.572
What for?

41:53.711 --> 41:56.578
I remember it all
like it was this morning.

41:56.747 --> 41:58.612
Everything.

41:59.450 --> 42:03.318
The smell of Anne's perfume
when I'd come through the door.

42:03.587 --> 42:07.717
That look she'd give me
like I was the only man that mattered.

42:09.159 --> 42:11.423
My Maria and...

42:11.662 --> 42:15.257
...her little smile
when she laid on my chest.

42:15.432 --> 42:18.196
She liked to listen to me breathing.

42:20.404 --> 42:22.395
They can't take that away.

42:24.174 --> 42:26.142
I feel like I really let them down.

42:26.310 --> 42:29.973
You will if you don't make it
out of here.

42:31.081 --> 42:33.572
But you're in the car, right?

42:34.218 --> 42:35.708
In the car?

42:35.886 --> 42:37.854
Means you're cliqued up
with somebody.

42:38.022 --> 42:39.819
A gang.

42:40.758 --> 42:42.419
Just hope...

42:42.726 --> 42:47.595
...you don't think all they want you
to do is run in the yard and yell nigger.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.907
How do you make it on your own?

43:01.545 --> 43:03.012
Perception is reality.

43:03.180 --> 43:07.742
I chose to create mine.
Others chose to accept it.

43:08.652 --> 43:10.916
Who was that guy you were talking to
at the yard?

43:11.088 --> 43:13.613
What is this, 20 fucking Questions?

43:17.294 --> 43:21.321
His name's Oso.
He's a southern shot caller.

43:21.498 --> 43:25.491
It means he's got the keys
to the house. It means...

43:27.438 --> 43:31.602
...none of his soldiers will make
a move without his say-so.

43:32.009 --> 43:34.102
I don't know.
How do you know who's with who?

43:37.381 --> 43:39.372
Okay, fish.

43:39.817 --> 43:42.718
I'll be the good <i>veterano</i>
and teach you prison politics.

43:42.886 --> 43:44.786
But you're gonna do something
for me.

43:45.189 --> 43:46.281
Okay, what?

43:46.457 --> 43:48.789
Stay away from me in the yard.

43:49.293 --> 43:50.988
- I understand.
- No, you don't.

43:51.161 --> 43:54.187
This is my world
until death do us part.

43:54.365 --> 43:56.560
You're only a tourist.

43:57.201 --> 43:59.669
All right, first lesson for woods
like you and me...

44:00.137 --> 44:03.038
...if it ain't white, it ain't right.

44:03.207 --> 44:06.074
Prison is not about street gangs.

44:06.243 --> 44:08.040
It's about race.

44:08.212 --> 44:10.908
<i>The Hispanics are cut in half.</i>
<i>You got the northerners...</i>

44:11.081 --> 44:13.811
<i>... and the southerners.</i>
<i>Trust me, they're always at war.</i>

44:13.984 --> 44:17.385
<i>With the blacks, you got a mixture</i>
<i>of gangs who forget their beefs...</i>

44:17.554 --> 44:20.853
<i>... and unite with the Asians</i>
<i>and the Pacific Islanders.</i>

44:21.025 --> 44:24.859
<i>Don't bother trying to figure out</i>
<i>who's who. They all hate you.</i>

44:25.029 --> 44:26.724
<i>Then you got the skins</i>
<i>and the woods.</i>

44:26.897 --> 44:30.264
<i>Nearly all the whites follow the Aryan</i>
<i>Brotherhood, who run the show.</i>

44:30.434 --> 44:34.165
Gangs underneath them will try to
recruit you, build up their numbers...

44:34.338 --> 44:36.863
...get you to sling drugs,
stab who they don't like.

44:37.041 --> 44:40.238
<i>You pay attention to who's calling</i>
<i>the shots with the whites.</i>

44:40.411 --> 44:43.039
<i>Tell you to do something</i>
<i>and you don't handle business...</i>

44:43.213 --> 44:44.407
<i>... they'll handle you.</i>

44:44.581 --> 44:45.843
What's up? How you doing?

44:46.550 --> 44:49.542
You see that Predator-looking
motherfucker over there?

44:50.721 --> 44:51.745
Yeah.

44:51.922 --> 44:53.787
- Crack it off, homey.
- Yo, watch it.

44:59.396 --> 45:01.626
No, no, no. Let it go for a minute.
Come on.

45:02.566 --> 45:04.557
Come on, Wade.
Book his fucking ass.

45:04.735 --> 45:06.566
Get up.

45:08.272 --> 45:10.934
- Get up, man.
- Come on, fight hard.

45:26.657 --> 45:28.249
- Want me to stop it now?
- Yeah.

45:28.425 --> 45:30.393
Shoot Turner in the leg
with the Mini-14.

45:30.561 --> 45:33.428
- But, sir, he's losing.
- Shoot Turner with the Mini-14.

45:36.567 --> 45:37.966
Get his ass. Come on.

45:38.368 --> 45:40.063
Fuck him up. Fuck him up.

45:40.237 --> 45:42.228
He jumped a female officer
on the main line.

45:42.406 --> 45:43.600
Now send him a message.

45:43.774 --> 45:45.571
I'll get him good with this one, sir.

45:47.277 --> 45:50.303
Don't let him up, Wade.
Stop that motherfucker.

45:52.182 --> 45:55.208
- Get down, homey. Get down!
- Fuck!

45:57.721 --> 45:59.848
That is the enemy down there,
officer.

46:00.023 --> 46:03.584
You show these assholes weakness
and they will send you a message.

46:03.761 --> 46:06.662
Blow holes in you with a piece of iron,
gut you like a fish.

46:06.830 --> 46:08.627
- Is that what you want?
- No, sir.

46:08.799 --> 46:11.563
That's right, that's not what you want.
It's real simple.

46:11.735 --> 46:14.727
You're either in the car with us
or you are not. Which one is it?

46:14.905 --> 46:17.339
- Because I can transfer you.
- I'm in the car, sir.

46:17.508 --> 46:19.669
Now you learn
from your experiences then.

46:19.843 --> 46:21.970
Now clear the yard.

46:22.146 --> 46:25.172
Call in the medical staff.
I'll do the report.

46:28.585 --> 46:29.847
You're making bones, wood.

46:31.688 --> 46:34.282
Time to get that shit clean.

46:38.829 --> 46:40.854
Why did they shoot that guy
with a rifle?

46:41.031 --> 46:45.331
Better question is, why didn't they
shoot you? You were kicking his ass.

46:46.203 --> 46:47.602
Can't somebody say something?

46:47.771 --> 46:50.205
Get something very clear
in your head.

46:50.374 --> 46:51.966
Once you leave that courtroom...

46:52.142 --> 46:56.476
...society's rules no longer apply.
We play by the cops' rules.

46:56.647 --> 46:59.138
We play by the gangs' rules.
However they want it.

46:59.883 --> 47:02.010
This fucking place is so twisted.

47:02.352 --> 47:05.116
Prison desensitizes you.

47:06.056 --> 47:08.718
First time you see a guy's face cut up,
you puke.

47:08.892 --> 47:11.087
Second time, you're concerned.

47:11.829 --> 47:15.060
After a while, you step right over
and could give a shit.

47:15.232 --> 47:18.463
It's no different for them
pulling the trigger.

47:18.635 --> 47:20.694
Make no mistake...

47:20.904 --> 47:22.394
...we're all in prison.

47:32.482 --> 47:35.679
Man, there's still a lot of fights
going on.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.617
Why Sacramento doesn't learn
to segregate the yards again...

47:38.789 --> 47:40.154
...is beyond me.

47:40.324 --> 47:43.020
Warden, how long have we been
working together?

47:43.694 --> 47:45.924
Trust me, sir.
I have it all under control.

47:47.631 --> 47:49.394
I know you do.

47:49.933 --> 47:52.697
All right. Thanks a lot.

47:55.539 --> 47:56.904
Well?

48:04.481 --> 48:06.039
There's Daddy.

48:11.722 --> 48:14.714
Way to be, homey. You got down.

48:21.598 --> 48:23.964
- Hey, guys.
- What was that?

48:26.570 --> 48:29.801
You can't survive in here on your own.
You just can't.

48:29.973 --> 48:32.237
So, what are you,
some Nazi skinhead now?

48:32.409 --> 48:34.502
I don't expect you to understand.

48:34.678 --> 48:36.407
I don't.

48:40.751 --> 48:43.720
- How we making out with the bills?
- Well...

48:44.187 --> 48:46.018
...the business loan is gone.

48:46.189 --> 48:48.817
I'm halfway through the equity line
on the house. And...

48:50.294 --> 48:53.320
You know, my temp job doesn't even
begin to cover our overhead.

48:54.631 --> 48:56.861
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to do.

48:57.034 --> 48:59.093
All right. Screw it. Sell the house.

48:59.269 --> 49:01.533
Sell my truck.
Sell whatever you can.

49:01.705 --> 49:03.332
Wade, that's our house.

49:03.507 --> 49:06.203
I know. But you and Michael
are what's important right now.

49:06.376 --> 49:08.139
We'll save up,
we'll get another house.

49:09.446 --> 49:10.879
Laura...

49:11.214 --> 49:12.875
...look at me.

49:13.283 --> 49:17.481
Soon as I get out of here,
all of this is history. I swear to you.

49:18.822 --> 49:22.087
So, what, they...? They protect you?

49:23.694 --> 49:25.218
In exchange for what?

49:25.395 --> 49:28.125
You just let me worry about that,
okay?

49:30.701 --> 49:32.635
- Get him.
- Kick his ass.

49:36.139 --> 49:38.334
Shoot them in the chest.
Get their attention.

49:41.745 --> 49:43.303
Nice shooting, Ranger.

49:43.480 --> 49:46.506
Damn, wood. That's good.

49:52.689 --> 49:54.680
Yeah. Get up...

50:05.535 --> 50:07.002
Get them.

50:12.776 --> 50:16.075
- What's up, man? You doing all right?
- Yeah.

50:19.249 --> 50:21.547
Get over there and show them
what you're made of.

50:21.718 --> 50:22.912
Why don't you, homey?

50:23.587 --> 50:26.283
You put in some work,
think you're calling the shots now?

50:26.456 --> 50:29.516
You think you're Billy Badass?
You better get your ass over there.

50:31.695 --> 50:34.255
I ain't seen you fight once
since I've been here.

50:35.132 --> 50:36.531
Let's get this motherfucker.

50:38.902 --> 50:40.096
- Get down.
- Fuck him.

50:41.538 --> 50:42.903
Hey.

50:43.573 --> 50:45.803
- They're in the fucking blind spot.
- Come on.

50:46.510 --> 50:48.068
Hit them with the CN gas.

50:55.886 --> 50:58.081
Get down or I'll put you down!

50:58.488 --> 51:00.422
Get down!

51:06.663 --> 51:09.564
You better have eyes in the back
of your fucking head.

51:19.276 --> 51:22.245
Smith, against the back of your cell.
Hands behind your head.

51:22.412 --> 51:23.970
You move, you will get shot.

51:24.147 --> 51:26.047
Crack 13.

51:27.317 --> 51:29.012
Let's go.

51:30.387 --> 51:32.252
Close 13.

51:37.461 --> 51:39.258
You get up, Smith.

51:40.130 --> 51:41.927
I warned you, fish.

51:42.099 --> 51:43.760
Now you got me in the hat with you.

51:44.234 --> 51:45.792
You think they'll let this slide?

51:45.969 --> 51:47.630
They're gonna green-light us both.

51:47.938 --> 51:50.771
I should kick
your fucking ass myself.

51:56.279 --> 51:58.577
It wouldn't be hard right now.

52:05.522 --> 52:07.114
Thanks, John.

52:12.329 --> 52:14.763
You wanna know how I survive?

52:15.065 --> 52:17.932
You're about to get a crash course,
my friend.

52:24.307 --> 52:26.138
You get everything
out of the house?

52:26.843 --> 52:30.210
Yeah. Yeah, the storage unit's
completely filled.

52:31.348 --> 52:33.976
You're okay with this mess
just until the escrow closes?

52:34.384 --> 52:36.716
Soon as we get the check,
Michael and I will find...

52:36.887 --> 52:39.583
Laura, of course I'm okay.

52:39.756 --> 52:42.190
You and Michael can stay
as long as you like.

52:47.264 --> 52:49.129
Always. Always snorting.
I'm not kidding.

52:49.299 --> 52:50.698
Pick it?

52:54.137 --> 52:55.434
Lieutenant.

52:55.605 --> 52:57.402
You getting some shopping done?

52:57.574 --> 53:00.702
Yeah, one can eat only
so much pizza and fast food.

53:00.877 --> 53:03.641
My wife and I recently divorced.

53:03.947 --> 53:05.039
Yeah.

53:05.215 --> 53:07.206
Oh, I'm sorry. This is my wife, Kelly.

53:07.384 --> 53:11.081
- This is Lieutenant Jackson.
- Bill. Call me Bill.

53:11.254 --> 53:12.949
Nice to meet you, Bill.

53:13.123 --> 53:15.591
Nice to meet you.
Well, congratulations.

53:15.759 --> 53:17.590
- A boy or girl?
- It's a girl.

53:17.761 --> 53:20.286
Oh, I remember these days,
they go by so fast.

53:20.463 --> 53:22.897
You guys are gonna make
great parents. I can tell.

53:23.066 --> 53:25.193
Are you all settled in from the move?

53:25.569 --> 53:26.593
Not completely.

53:26.770 --> 53:29.261
We still have to buy a house.
We need the extra room.

53:29.439 --> 53:32.806
Let me know if I can help.
And don't be afraid to tell people...

53:32.976 --> 53:35.536
...around here that you are part
of the family.

53:35.712 --> 53:39.580
More than half this town is employed
at the prison. We take care of our own.

53:39.749 --> 53:41.580
Okay, I'll do that. Thank you.

53:41.751 --> 53:43.981
- See you tomorrow, James.
- See you, lieutenant.

53:45.956 --> 53:47.890
He seems like a really nice guy.

53:55.031 --> 53:56.555
Back up.

53:58.368 --> 53:59.392
Turn around.

53:59.569 --> 54:00.627
Two steps back.

54:00.804 --> 54:02.635
Close 13!

54:05.242 --> 54:07.403
Keep your head up out there today.

54:07.577 --> 54:08.942
What do you care?

54:09.112 --> 54:11.205
It'll give you something else
to shoot at.

54:11.381 --> 54:13.110
All right. Suit yourself.

54:23.493 --> 54:27.088
It's done, homey. Regulation time.

54:33.136 --> 54:35.001
There's my bitch, huh?

54:35.305 --> 54:38.797
Fucking lame. You should have known
after all the shit we did for you.

54:38.975 --> 54:40.465
We?

54:42.379 --> 54:43.607
Shut your hole.

54:43.780 --> 54:46.374
Far as I'm concerned,
you're the fucking lame.

54:52.255 --> 54:55.520
I saw you pass the shank
on the bus.

55:03.199 --> 55:04.689
Fuck!

55:11.308 --> 55:12.866
Weapon went in the toilet.

55:16.012 --> 55:18.310
No wood will touch you.

55:19.249 --> 55:21.479
If you wanna ride with us,
come see me.

55:21.651 --> 55:24.882
Otherwise you're on your own.

55:29.993 --> 55:31.824
I can't believe
he's giving them a pass.

55:32.429 --> 55:34.829
Stick Bodie and Rooker in the hole.

55:35.365 --> 55:37.230
Wait, Bill. What about Samson?

55:39.569 --> 55:41.230
What about him?

55:41.771 --> 55:45.263
When I get something on him,
it will be something that'll stick.

55:48.578 --> 55:50.773
Why does he hate that guy
so much?

55:51.381 --> 55:54.942
Samson gassed him on the main line
five years ago.

55:55.118 --> 55:57.985
Hit him square in the face
with fucking piss and shit.

55:58.154 --> 56:01.681
Ended up catching hepatitis A which
he passed on to his wife and kid.

56:02.359 --> 56:04.725
We all got our Danny Samsons
in here.

56:04.894 --> 56:06.794
You stay on the job long enough...

56:06.963 --> 56:08.760
...so will you.

56:14.137 --> 56:16.298
What a piece of work is man.

56:16.473 --> 56:19.909
And there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so.

56:20.076 --> 56:22.567
Human beings are
perhaps never more dangerous...

56:23.079 --> 56:26.276
...than when they are convinced
beyond a doubt that they are right.

56:27.183 --> 56:29.083
Patience, penance.

56:29.686 --> 56:31.779
What do these ones represent?

56:31.955 --> 56:33.286
That's my calendar.

56:33.456 --> 56:34.889
Anne's birthday.

56:35.058 --> 56:36.650
That was our first date.

56:36.826 --> 56:38.919
Our anniversary.

56:39.095 --> 56:40.619
My Maria's birthday.

56:40.797 --> 56:42.992
The first day she walked.

56:43.466 --> 56:46.492
And the day they were taken
from me.

56:48.104 --> 56:50.095
And that empty box,
what's that one?

56:50.507 --> 56:51.974
This is...

56:52.675 --> 56:54.666
...the day we're reunited.

56:58.281 --> 57:00.215
You writing your girl?

57:01.284 --> 57:04.117
Yeah, I'm trying.
I'm just running out of things to say.

57:05.855 --> 57:07.322
Now...

57:07.490 --> 57:08.980
...you said...

57:09.159 --> 57:11.491
...you've been together six years.

57:11.661 --> 57:14.528
How come you haven't married her
before now?

57:15.832 --> 57:18.300
I just wanted to be set first.

57:18.468 --> 57:19.992
You know?

57:20.270 --> 57:22.568
Just wanted to give her
some stability...

57:22.739 --> 57:24.798
...something neither of us had
growing up.

57:26.342 --> 57:28.776
Boy, you sure fucked that up,
didn't you?

57:29.979 --> 57:31.378
Yeah, you could say that.

57:35.685 --> 57:37.516
Hey, John.

57:37.987 --> 57:40.114
You think Samson
will keep his word?

57:40.290 --> 57:42.781
Oh, just don't give him a reason
not to.

57:43.793 --> 57:46.853
You're an island now,
in a sea of sharks.

57:47.931 --> 57:50.297
They all know you're on your own.

57:52.068 --> 57:53.968
Come on. Finish it off good.
Let's go.

57:54.137 --> 57:55.900
Come on.
This is the last one, buddy.

57:56.072 --> 57:58.165
- Yeah.
- Come on.

57:59.175 --> 58:00.733
Yeah.

58:01.544 --> 58:03.978
Make them practice hard, coach.
Come on.

58:04.147 --> 58:06.138
Todd's amazing.

58:06.683 --> 58:08.981
Come on, Todd. Big T.

58:11.321 --> 58:14.552
You know, I was thinking
maybe we should cool it for a while.

58:15.725 --> 58:17.192
Cool what?

58:17.360 --> 58:21.660
You know, stick to CDC policy.
Do it by the books just for a while.

58:21.831 --> 58:24.664
That bureaucratic bullshit
does not work. You know this.

58:24.834 --> 58:26.631
Of all people, you should know this.

58:26.803 --> 58:29.499
Just those fucking yard cameras,
they pick up everything.

58:29.672 --> 58:31.765
All it takes is for one person
to get a hold...

58:31.941 --> 58:33.932
Those cameras are there
to police ourselves.

58:34.110 --> 58:37.102
Ain't nobody checking nothing.
Nothing.

58:37.280 --> 58:39.339
Where is this coming from?

58:40.717 --> 58:43.481
I just don't want us to lose everything
we worked for, Bill.

58:43.653 --> 58:45.678
I mean, I'm too close to my pension.

58:45.855 --> 58:48.756
And I don't wanna lose it
over some punk inmate, fucking...

58:48.925 --> 58:52.520
Wait. Stop. How much money
you make in OT last year?

58:52.695 --> 58:55.425
- How much money did you make?
- Sixty-eight grand.

58:55.598 --> 58:58.066
- On top of a good salary?
- Yes. Yes.

58:58.234 --> 59:01.863
You know, there's a reason why we're
the highest paid officers in the state.

59:02.038 --> 59:03.869
Because all they give a shit about...

59:04.040 --> 59:07.100
...is that we keep those pieces of shit
out of society.

59:07.277 --> 59:11.213
And ain't nobody gonna burst that
bubble, baby. Nobody. Okay?

59:12.181 --> 59:13.808
- You just keep doing it.
- All right.

59:13.983 --> 59:15.951
- Trust me, all right?
- All right.

59:16.119 --> 59:17.950
Come on, Todd.

59:18.988 --> 59:21.047
Coming around. Come on, coach.

59:21.224 --> 59:23.021
Make them hustle.

59:43.680 --> 59:45.307
Stop!

59:45.615 --> 59:46.741
Wade?

59:49.319 --> 59:50.616
Stay in the house.

59:51.921 --> 59:53.149
- I said, stop.
- Wade.

59:58.294 --> 59:59.989
Bad dream?

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:02.131
You ever think about
the people you killed?

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:03.993
No.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:07.301
Can't get this guy's face
out of my head.

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:12.070
I should have stayed inside,
let him go.

01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:13.731
No.

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:15.374
You did what you had to do.

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:18.207
Protect your family.
That's the only thing that matters.

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.448
Can I ask you something?

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:33.554
Why didn't you just kill
the two guys?

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:35.561
Why the others?

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:43.233
Sorry.

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:45.597
No.

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:50.077
You don't have to tell me.

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:54.944
You sleep three feet away
from a guy...

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:57.052
...breathing the same air...

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.211
...you have to know things
about him.

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:09.395
And when your life is forever
defined by a single action...

01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:11.897
...it changes time.

01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:15.733
It feels like a thousand years ago
in my body...

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:17.497
...but in my mind...

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:20.573
...it feels like it happened yesterday.

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:27.010
You know that feeling when you come
home and see your wife and kid?

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:30.085
Yeah.

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:35.890
Try to imagine the unimaginable.

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:38.587
When I came home...

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:41.590
...and saw them lying there...

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:43.857
...exposed.

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:47.426
<i>Covered in blood.</i>

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:53.273
My little Maria's broken legs
were spread so far apart...

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:55.604
...they dislocated her hips.

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:57.803
She was 7 years old.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:01.281
I wanted those two...

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.614
...punks...

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:07.845
...to experience what I did.

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:10.254
I wanted them to know
the unimaginable...

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:12.451
...and I gave them that.

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:17.399
I killed every member
of their families.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.899
Their bloodline wiped clean.

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:22.430
I took their madness.

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:24.505
I purified it.

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:28.308
Before I killed them,
they knew that loss.

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:35.349
I wanted the death penalty
but I didn't get it.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.919
I wanted to be with my Anne
and my Maria.

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:46.591
And that doesn't give
those motherfuckers the right...

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.924
...to break me.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:53.064
It does give them the right
to watch me...

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:55.795
...rot.

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:13.988
Hey.

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:17.251
What's wrong? Are you okay?

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.621
Yeah, I'm just tired.

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:21.395
Are you sure?

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:22.997
Yeah.

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:26.731
I can't believe
it's been 11 months already.

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:30.068
All I think about
is holding you again.

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:33.534
I was hoping you'd bring Mikey.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:37.837
Yeah, I would have but he had
some nightmares after the last visit...

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:40.744
...so I thought it'd be better
to leave him at home.

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.010
Yeah, you're right.

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:46.178
He probably shouldn't see
this place ever again, anyway.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.189
Yeah.

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.262
So we sold the house.

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:57.756
Okay. The full 425, right?

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:02.301
No. We closed at 380.

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:05.736
What? Three-eighty. Shit, Laura.

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:09.241
With all the equity gone in the house,
you're gonna barely make $ 10,000.

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:10.603
How're you gonna...?

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:14.443
Don't think I haven't thought of that?
Maybe you should have done it.

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:16.608
Hey, I'm the one stuck doing time,
remember?

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:18.879
You think I'm not doing it too?

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:21.250
You're in there hanging
with your homeboys...

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:24.257
...l'm dealing with the fucking mess
called our life.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.252
Your tools are gone.

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:27.862
Your truck, gone.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.657
Our house, Wade, is gone.

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:32.164
Meanwhile, I'm working
this piece of shit temp job.

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:34.803
I barely see Michael.
I get to live with my mother...

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:36.962
...and listen to all her bullshit...

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:39.607
...while everyone we know
stares at me in pity.

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:43.176
All right. Calm down. Okay?

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:46.037
I'm sorry.
I know you're dealing with a lot.

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:49.150
But you have no idea the shit
that goes on in here.

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:51.149
What I've had to do just to survive.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.483
No. Tell me because I don't know.

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:58.288
I can't.

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:00.691
- Fuck you, Wade.
- No.

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.392
Don't go, Laura, please.

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:03.827
Please, just sit back down!

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:06.031
Please!

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:20.247
You wanna know the secret
to making it in here?

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:23.316
Routine. Just like on the outside.

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:26.649
Get up in the morning.
Eat your breakfast.

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:29.950
Do your chores. Exercise.

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:31.354
Go to work.

01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:35.258
Everything, you do it down
to the last detail.

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.695
This is the only prisoner.

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:43.528
Still thinking about your girl?
The visit?

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:46.367
You should have seen her face,
man.

01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:48.772
I couldn't do a fucking thing
about it.

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:51.809
I've seen it mess with a lot of guys.

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:55.782
You leave that visit on a bad note,
it stays that way.

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:58.143
Keep moving.

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:02.216
She's everything to me, man.

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.549
If I don't have her or Michael...

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:11.028
- I'm so done with this shit.
- Come on, motherfucker.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.566
- Here we go. This is gonna be a brawl.
- Can't wait.

01:06:13.869 --> 01:06:16.360
- Fuck that, motherfucker.
- I'm not fighting you, man.

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:18.501
Hold that motherfucker. Come on.

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:20.369
Get him. Get that...

01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:27.175
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Yeah, fuck. Fuck that motherfucker.

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:34.512
- You guys called me up here for this?
- Clear the room.

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:36.555
You heard the lieutenant. Get out.

01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:39.857
You wanna fuck with me?

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:52.305
Put him in the infirmary.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:01.108
If I debrief, I wanna be put in PC
for the rest of my term.

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:02.614
Or I'm fucking dead.

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:05.680
You give me everything.

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:08.586
Everything.

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:11.383
You're in protective custody at night.

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.287
Speak.

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:38.647
And to think, 19 years
I've been dealing with you assholes.

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:41.289
Pushing me. Testing me.

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:44.756
Hell, I've had six hits put on me
personally that I know about.

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:46.417
Imagine the stress every day...

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:49.291
...wondering if today's the day
they get you.

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.258
People wonder why prison guards...

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:56.769
...have an average life expectancy
of only 55 years.

01:07:57.406 --> 01:07:59.567
Well, that won't be me.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:01.835
I don't succumb to pressure.

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:07.138
I inflict it.

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:09.341
Jesus Christ. Please. Please!

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:12.453
- I'm begging you. I'm begging you.
- So tell me. Tell me.

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:14.213
Please, lieutenant. I'm sorry.

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:19.122
And if I let this slide,
what's the next asshole gonna pull?

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:21.763
I guess I gotta put
a little more fear in you.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:24.456
- Up the ante.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:27.033
Please, God.

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.928
You know what?

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:31.964
I think I got a better way.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.872
You know that inmate
that Samson stuck on the bus?

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:38.206
- Yeah.
- He died.

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.971
Now, I could give a fuck.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:41.411
But you should.

01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:45.417
See, with the right paperwork by me
and an eyewitness which I now have...

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:48.318
...Samson's going down
for murder one.

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:50.182
With you as an accessory.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.656
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:54.728
I should've told you the truth.
I thought he was gonna kill me.

01:08:54.897 --> 01:08:58.389
- I've never been to prison.
- That ship's already sailed, Porter.

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:01.001
Looks like you and me
gonna spend more time together.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:04.060
Please, lieutenant,
I only have four more months left.

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:07.408
I'll do whatever you want, please!

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.134
Goddamn it!

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.572
Mr. Samson, with the jury
having convicted you...

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:19.448
...in count one of first-degree murder,
I sentence you to life without parole.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:22.682
This term will run consecutive
with your initial sentence.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:26.794
Mr. Porter, with the jury
having convicted you...

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:29.522
...in count one of accessory
after the fact to murder...

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:32.861
...I sentence you to the high term
of three years.

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:36.060
And since Lieutenant Jackson's
testimony was so overwhelming...

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:39.765
...l'm adding an additional three years
in regard to your gang allegations.

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:44.506
These six years will run consecutive
with your initial sentence.

01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:47.678
I hope you get your life
back on track.

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:10.233
I heard.

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:11.767
I'm sorry.

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:18.509
What the fuck did I do
to deserve this?

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:24.148
No, I do not have to face reality,
Mom.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.221
Look at Wade.
Look at what he's become.

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:29.254
It happens. It just happens.

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:31.859
- Some people go off the deep end...
- What do you want?

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:33.722
You want me
just to walk away, right?

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:37.093
- You just want me to desert him?
- I'm sorry, but he has deserted you.

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:38.927
I am trying to get through to you.

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:42.593
You are 33 years old,
a single mother.

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:45.137
You're gonna be over 40
before he gets out.

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:47.070
If he does something else,
what then?

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:49.473
You have waited in vain.

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:55.343
I was 26 when your father split.

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:59.078
Left you and me without a pot
to piss in, remember?

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:01.780
I don't regret a moment of it...

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:04.858
...working all those years
to support us.

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:07.592
But take a good look at me, Laura.

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:11.995
I'm 50 years old and I'm still alone.

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:15.162
I don't wanna see you
go through that.

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.140
I knew it.

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:32.349
She left me.

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:35.914
She fucking left me.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.994
- You want me to take him to the hole?
- For what?

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:04.303
You're letting them beat you.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.240
Who gives a fuck.

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.940
I got nothing to go back to now.
I got fucking nothing.

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:12.414
You of all people should know
what that fucking feels like.

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:28.897
How're you holding up
in here, John?

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:32.399
Shouldn't you be on that fishing boat
of yours?

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:35.042
Or taking that pretty wife of yours
on a holiday?

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:37.940
As a matter of fact,
I was on that boat this morning.

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:42.310
You need a new pair of glasses?

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:44.452
- No. No, l...
- Sure?

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:47.282
I kind of got used to them
being broken.

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:53.188
Haven't seen any of your letters
on the website lately.

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:59.661
Whatever debt
you think you owe me...

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:03.002
...you paid that a long time ago.

01:14:03.872 --> 01:14:06.136
You think that's the reason
I keep coming back?

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:08.333
No. You've been a good friend
to me, Gordon.

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:13.043
But you and I both know that you'd
never see the walls of a prison again...

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:15.843
...if it weren't for me,
and that pains me.

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:18.653
So please, just...

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:21.450
...go enjoy your life, and...

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:23.682
- Look.
- Stop wasting it here.

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:25.349
John.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:27.785
Guard.

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:50.877
Hey. Hey.

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:54.420
They're gonna take him into surgery.
We're not allowed to go in there.

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.581
Hey, Todd. Todd, hey, it's Daddy.

01:14:56.959 --> 01:15:00.656
- It hurts.
- Oh, yeah. I know, champ.

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:02.660
You gotta be tough, okay?

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:05.493
They're gonna take you in there
and fix you up. All right?

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.235
I'll be right here, okay, buddy?

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:12.100
I'll be right here when you come out.
I promise.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.100
- Be tough, okay, baby?
- Hey, Stacy.

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:25.118
- What happened?
- He was playing in the front yard...

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:28.256
...with his friends, he ran
into the street to chase the ball...

01:15:28.423 --> 01:15:30.482
...this guy came plowing
around the corner...

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:34.151
...and he didn't even brake
before he smacked into him.

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:37.355
It's this motherfucker's
third DUI strike.

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:40.225
- How do you know that?
- The cops.

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:44.368
They're over there
guarding his fucking room right now.

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:00.886
Looks like your air bag saved you.

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:03.122
Yeah.

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:05.658
Too bad my son didn't have one.

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:09.561
I am so, so sorry. How's he doing?

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:11.289
I don't wanna hear your bullshit.

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:14.026
I didn't mean to hit him. l...

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:19.073
You better pray...

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:23.338
...a judge shows you leniency
because I will not.

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:27.645
There's not a jail or prison
in this state...

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:30.610
...that you can hide from me.

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:33.649
I'll put the word out
that you're a fucking pedophile.

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:36.123
Get a bunch
of hard-hitting gangsters...

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:40.057
...to pump your ass
till you bleed to death.

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:42.560
Or better yet...

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:46.030
...I got your license number
and address from the incident report.

01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:49.068
Maybe while you're getting
fucked up the ass in the joint...

01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:52.866
...l'll swing by your house
and hit your fucking kids.

01:16:57.646 --> 01:17:01.047
You just fucked
with the wrong motherfucker, son.

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:20.869
One fucking thing. That's all I can ask
is one fucking thing.

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:26.000
I can't get...

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:32.679
Jesus Christ. Jesus.

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:35.040
You got eight seconds.

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:40.747
- Escort.
- What, what.

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:43.049
Yeah, nigga.
OG in the house, motherfucker.

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:46.251
- So sorry...
- What's up, cos?

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:50.193
- What's up, my nig?
- Fuck you, <i>tinto.</i>

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:54.663
My motherfucker.

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:58.033
Yeah, bitch, I see you.
And I got something for your ass.

01:17:58.206 --> 01:18:02.336
You will see me, motherfucker.
Yeah, you will see me soon.

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:11.450
They already gave you
the keys to the apartment, right?

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.850
Yeah. I just wish
it had more storage space.

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:15.887
It's cheap, that's what matters.

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:18.185
And hell, there's plenty
of space here.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.056
Oh, no.
That one actually stays here.

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:23.725
Oh, thanks, honey.

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:26.464
Wait. Thanks.

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:31.471
Why are you putting Daddy's clothes
over there?

01:18:40.048 --> 01:18:42.107
Well, baby...

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:45.383
Daddy's not gonna live with us
anymore.

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:48.614
But you said he was coming home.

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:52.424
I know, I did. But things changed.

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:55.688
- Honey, it's just...
- Sometimes...

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:58.924
Sometimes, Mikey...

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:02.161
...people move on to another life.

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:04.066
And all we can do is say goodbye.

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:05.968
Is he mad at us?

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:10.737
No. No, baby, Daddy loves us both
very, very much.

01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:13.439
You know what?
We're gonna be fine.

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:16.448
Okay? We can talk about this
later. Why...?

01:19:16.618 --> 01:19:20.019
Why don't you get your coloring book,
and you can draw Grandma a picture.

01:19:20.188 --> 01:19:21.712
Okay?

01:19:24.726 --> 01:19:25.920
Mikey?

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:28.491
Where are you?

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:45.502
Affects you...

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.238
Porter!

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:55.180
You got a visitor.

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:16.774
I'll give you guys a little extra time.

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:18.545
Thanks.

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:27.685
Is everything okay?
Is Mikey all right?

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:29.881
Yeah. No, no, he's fine.

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:33.656
Didn't think I'd see you again.

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:37.228
To tell you the truth, me neither.

01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:42.426
Look, I don't know what to do.

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:43.831
At the rate we're going...

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:47.099
...Mikey will be starting junior high
by the time you get out.

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:54.405
But I know he doesn't wanna spend
the rest of his life without you.

01:20:57.285 --> 01:20:58.946
And I don't either.

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:03.915
I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:21:05.327 --> 01:21:07.261
Your letter killed me.

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:13.731
I mean, if I don't have you or Michael
to come home to...

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:15.597
...l'm not gonna make it.

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:21.135
It's just that any time
I hang on to any bit of hope...

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:23.675
...it gets taken away from me.

01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:26.538
So you tell me.

01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:30.674
- Do I wait for you?
- I want you to.

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:34.052
But I understand if you can't.

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:36.550
Well, I will.

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:40.153
However long it takes.

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:45.198
I just need to know
that when you come out...

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:46.732
...it'll be you.

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:58.470
Love is the most subtle force
on Earth.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.405
- It was Laura.
- No shit.

01:22:05.854 --> 01:22:07.981
Look, John...

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:13.484
...I know you're never getting out of
here. I don't mean any disrespect...

01:22:13.895 --> 01:22:17.991
...but this guy has robbed me the next
seven years of my life with my family.

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:19.633
I can't let this happen.

01:22:20.201 --> 01:22:22.999
Last time I checked, they don't
commute a man's sentence...

01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:25.537
...just because he's homesick.

01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:28.802
Unless he's got something
to barter with.

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:32.108
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:36.211
Expose the shit they're pulling.

01:22:37.485 --> 01:22:41.819
Right, but nobody is gonna risk going
against Jackson, not even Collins.

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.850
You've gotta think
outside these walls.

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:48.462
Get the right people involved,
force them to pay attention.

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:50.222
How?

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:53.958
Please just tell me how.

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:02.575
Hey, LT, how's your son doing?

01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:09.650
Sorry.

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:13.615
Listen, Porter in 13
has been asking for you.

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:28.995
I'm in no fucking mood.
What do you want?

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:31.001
Ready to give you a good show, sir.

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:33.231
Come again?

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:35.642
You know that Crip in Cell 19?

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:38.108
Motherfucker's one of the reasons
I'm in here.

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:42.048
- You want a little payback, huh?
- Yeah.

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:45.209
You put us in the yard. It'll crack off.

01:23:45.553 --> 01:23:48.317
I'm so sick of all you pieces of shit.

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:49.787
I'll tell you what.

01:23:50.325 --> 01:23:53.123
You wanna handle this
like a soldier so bad, you got it.

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:55.728
But it's my rules,
you're going all the way.

01:23:55.897 --> 01:23:56.921
What do you mean?

01:23:57.298 --> 01:24:00.028
Whether you like it or not,
you're going into that yard.

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:02.601
And one of you motherfuckers
ain't coming out alive.

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:07.572
Even if I gotta end it myself, start
taking you fuckers out one by one.

01:24:07.742 --> 01:24:09.403
You hear me?

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:15.978
Didn't see that one coming.

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:22.513
- <i>You got the address I gave you?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:25.716
<i>You just make sure you get through</i>
<i>to him. Or this doesn't work.</i>

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.623
Why risk it? I told you we'd wait.

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:29.423
For seven more years?

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:31.622
No, baby, what they did was wrong.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.234
<i>It's not fair to either of us, or Mikey.</i>

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:37.735
What if something happens, though?
And you never make it out of here?

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:39.168
I'm coming home.

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.774
<i>Just make sure you don't go</i>
<i>to anyone in Corrections.</i>

01:24:41.943 --> 01:24:44.104
<i>We don't know who we can trust.</i>

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:45.840
Can I help you?

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:48.346
- Mr. Camrose?
- Yeah.

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:20.805
Crack 13.

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:26.178
Let's go. Right there.
Right there. Stop.

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:37.955
Let's go.

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.161
Two steps back.

01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:44.237
I know what's going on. Don't.

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:46.635
Even if you win,
you're throwing your life away.

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.673
What do you care?
You're just like them.

01:25:48.843 --> 01:25:52.404
- I'm not like them.
- Then do something about it.

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:56.909
Are you sure Wade said
it was this morning?

01:25:57.085 --> 01:25:59.178
He said they take him
to the yard at 8.

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:02.755
If he doesn't fight, all we have
is circumstantial evidence.

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:05.916
We need to seize those yard tapes
before they erase them.

01:26:12.133 --> 01:26:14.363
Whatever happens,
it does not leave this car.

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:16.598
Copy that.

01:26:24.045 --> 01:26:27.242
When your life is defined
by a single action...

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:30.213
...you change the concept of time.

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.091
Yeah, motherfucker.

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:45.925
Here we go.

01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:58.936
Think it's smart
to have them in the yard?

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:01.206
If I have to take
one of these assholes out...

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:03.373
...we write it off
that we stopped a riot.

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:17.590
Looks like Porter bit off
more than he could chew.

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:37.317
Okay, he got the point. Let's stop it.

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:38.975
No.

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.529
Now.

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:33.331
Go ahead.

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:51.992
You do it,
or the next one does not miss.

01:28:52.393 --> 01:28:53.519
Not worth it. Get down.

01:29:07.308 --> 01:29:08.673
Fellas, okay, fuck that shit.

01:29:08.843 --> 01:29:12.643
If they want <i>sangre</i> on their <i>manos,</i>
<i>órale,</i> we'll give them <i>sangre.</i>

01:29:16.884 --> 01:29:18.283
Let it go, Bill.

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:22.389
They'll whack us, our families.
It's not worth it. You know it.

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:23.850
Let it go.

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:31.430
Clear the yard.

01:29:43.611 --> 01:29:45.078
Move it.

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:50.479
Cell 13, off the yard!

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:09.863
Do you think it worked?

01:30:10.037 --> 01:30:12.972
Depends on whether your girl
got through to Gordon.

01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:16.501
- I can't believe you got them to stand.
- Easy.

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:19.669
There's one thing they hate
more than each other. Cops.

01:30:19.847 --> 01:30:20.973
Especially Jackson.

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:23.973
Both of you,
back in the fucking yard now.

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:27.113
Move your fucking asses!

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:38.822
It's gonna be all right, honey.

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.376
You got me, Diaz?

01:30:58.553 --> 01:31:02.250
Affirmative, LT.
They fucking twitch, I'll waste them.

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:12.697
Oh, fuck, Bill.

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:23.239
I'm gonna go to the infirmary.

01:31:24.512 --> 01:31:26.844
Got something going on
with my throat.

01:31:27.982 --> 01:31:31.042
That's what my report will reflect.

01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:37.458
Open the yard door.

01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:41.826
Holy fuck, we're in it now.

01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:59.912
You fuckers think anybody cares
if you make a stink?

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:03.414
Nobody gives a shit about you.

01:32:04.051 --> 01:32:07.953
You see, the thing is, I got you two,
on camera, leaving the yard alive.

01:32:08.122 --> 01:32:09.885
So if anybody checks my report...

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:12.719
...they'll see that old boy here
showed his true colors.

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:14.589
Stuck this bone crusher in your ear.

01:32:14.762 --> 01:32:17.697
Of course, we had to take him out
with the Mini-14.

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:19.628
And the shitty thing about it...

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:23.395
...is they'll just send me two fresh new
assholes to replace you by sundown.

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.537
LT!

01:32:29.977 --> 01:32:31.569
You fucking...

01:32:40.788 --> 01:32:43.256
You think God...

01:32:47.828 --> 01:32:50.319
...will let me see my family now?

01:32:50.598 --> 01:32:51.622
Yeah.

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.327
You...

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:00.265
John?

01:33:00.441 --> 01:33:01.908
John.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:10.073
I knew you weren't with us!

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:12.082
Guess what, Diaz?

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:14.448
The car just crashed.

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:27.601
I've locked down the SHU. Alert
all sections. I'm headed in there now.

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:31.728
Camrose, what are you doing here?

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:33.897
Agent Skiletti, FBI.
We need to talk to you.

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:35.872
Sorry, I have an emergency
I need to...

01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:40.139
This is a federal inquiry. You need
to tell me what that emergency is.

01:33:40.314 --> 01:33:42.077
I have one dead lieutenant,
one inmate.

01:33:42.249 --> 01:33:43.716
What are their names?

01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:45.875
Lieutenant Bill Jackson.

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:48.112
The inmate is Smith. John Smith.

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:51.383
I wanna see the tapes of the SHU
yard before anyone touches them.

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:54.255
How do you know it happened
in the yard?

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:57.559
Collins...

01:33:57.732 --> 01:33:59.131
...you weren't with them.

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.460
Everyone knows it.

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:02.603
You think that matters?

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.139
They'll run me out of here.

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:10.277
There won't be a prison in the system
that'll touch me.

01:34:10.444 --> 01:34:12.207
Now what do I do?

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:30.964
And you knew nothing about this?

01:34:31.132 --> 01:34:33.600
I was in the infirmary,
just like my report says.

01:34:33.768 --> 01:34:37.295
Look, I fail to see why the FBI thinks
they had to get involved...

01:34:37.471 --> 01:34:40.406
...before my people finish. I mean...
- After what I just saw?

01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:41.598
We're involved.

01:34:41.776 --> 01:34:44.745
Let me make this clear,
Wade Porter is now a federal witness.

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:47.540
I want him in protective custody
until he's released.

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:50.843
Camrose, how did you know this
was gonna happen before the fact?

01:34:51.018 --> 01:34:53.418
Sorry, he's not at liberty
to disclose that.

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:55.282
That's part of our investigation.

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:58.087
You know what amazes me, Frank...

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:01.957
...is that you didn't know.

01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:10.603
Wade's been put
into protective custody.

01:35:10.771 --> 01:35:12.204
Nothing'll happen to him.

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:16.400
I'm also gonna push for his extra time
to be commuted for his testimony.

01:35:16.577 --> 01:35:17.908
Well, what does that mean?

01:35:18.079 --> 01:35:20.513
He'll get out the minute
his original sentence is up.

01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:22.876
Which is less than three months,
right?

01:35:26.053 --> 01:35:27.384
Oh, my God.

01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:29.346
Thank you.

01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:37.522
This was left in your cell.

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:39.222
Thanks.

01:35:40.968 --> 01:35:43.232
I'm Gordon Camrose.

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:45.895
- A friend of John's.
- Hey, Gordon.

01:35:46.774 --> 01:35:48.639
Nice to meet you.

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:50.572
Thank you so much
for getting involved.

01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:52.372
Yeah. Sure.

01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:55.244
I heard you were a captain.

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:58.544
Yeah, I guarded John for 20 years.

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:03.288
I spent more time with him than I did
with my own family, seems like.

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:08.986
He saved me from a sticking.

01:36:09.163 --> 01:36:11.131
- I don't know if he told you that.
- No.

01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:12.765
Yeah.

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:15.660
I'd have been dead for sure.

01:36:17.671 --> 01:36:20.731
Though it ain't the only reason
I watched out for him.

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:23.672
And I tried to explain that to him.

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:27.676
He was one of my true friends.

01:36:28.816 --> 01:36:30.545
Mine too.

01:36:32.753 --> 01:36:37.156
Son of a bitch never told me anything
about this the last time I saw him.

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:45.196
Then your <i>fiancée</i>
came out of the blue, you know.

01:36:45.366 --> 01:36:47.527
She wanted me to tell you...

01:36:49.103 --> 01:36:52.834
...she wanted me to give you
a message about a new wedding date.

01:36:53.007 --> 01:36:54.406
Yeah.

01:36:55.609 --> 01:37:00.012
- Thank you.
- Yeah, Wade, get some rest, okay?

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:01.906
Hey...

01:37:02.883 --> 01:37:05.408
...John went out the way he wanted.

01:37:06.587 --> 01:37:08.145
They never broke him.

01:37:08.322 --> 01:37:09.755
No.

01:37:11.792 --> 01:37:13.225
No, they didn't.

01:37:30.211 --> 01:37:32.736
<i>Usually I'm quoting</i>
<i>someone else's words.</i>

01:37:32.913 --> 01:37:36.246
<i>The least I can do is give you</i>
<i>some John Smith originals.</i>

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:38.078
<i>They won't be poetic.</i>

01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:39.617
<i>But they'll be the truth.</i>

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:42.856
Close 13.

01:37:45.292 --> 01:37:47.886
Come on. I'm supposed to be in PC
the rest of my term.

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:50.326
- Jackson said...
- Jackson's dead.

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:56.127
You can get up.

01:37:56.303 --> 01:37:58.533
<i>Yes, prison desensitizes you.</i>

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:03.440
<i>But it also forces you to see</i>
<i>what's most important.</i>

01:38:03.844 --> 01:38:06.779
<i>Family. And loyalty.</i>

01:38:07.147 --> 01:38:10.378
<i>Because a con like you knows</i>
<i>neither exists in this place.</i>

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:20.992
<i>So don't run</i>
<i>from who you've become, felon.</i>

01:38:21.161 --> 01:38:22.185
<i>Embrace it.</i>

01:38:22.363 --> 01:38:23.625
<i>Grow from it.</i>

01:38:23.797 --> 01:38:27.289
<i>And you'll never lose sight</i>
<i>of what truly matters.</i>

01:38:28.969 --> 01:38:32.905
<i>That's my final piece of advice,</i>
<i>Wade Porter.</i>

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:36.770
<i>You protect your family at all costs.</i>
<i>Even if you're forced to kill again.</i>

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:42.880
<i>Because if I had to, I'd wipe out</i>
<i>the whole planet to get mine back.</i>

01:38:51.926 --> 01:38:54.007
<i>So long,
friend.</i>

01:43:54.008 --> 01:43:55.009
