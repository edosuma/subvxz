[theme music]

00:58.126 --> 00:59.560
Dad doesn't know
what's going on, does he?

00:59.660 --> 01:00.428
No.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.563
He never does.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.298
Hand me that spatula.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.199
There he is.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.100
He's coming.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.034
He can't.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.001
I'm not ready.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.537
Mom, you got to stall him.

01:09.637 --> 01:10.738
Oh, OK.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.173
Here, do that.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.211
Happy birthday.

01:17.311 --> 01:20.548
Don't go in there.

01:20.648 --> 01:21.549
Why not?

01:21.649 --> 01:24.252
Because alien
lifeforms have invaded

01:24.352 --> 01:25.419
and they're taking over.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.320
Good lord.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.989
They're after the corn.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.459
Those beans.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.461
Wait a minute.

01:33.561 --> 01:36.063
There's something going on
in there for my birthday,

01:36.164 --> 01:37.265
isn't there?

01:37.365 --> 01:39.467
Oh, I should have known
better than to try to fool

01:39.567 --> 01:43.036
a man of your age and wisdom.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.338
There's all these
short people in there

01:44.438 --> 01:46.307
making you a birthday feast.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.308
They are?

01:47.408 --> 01:48.209
Really?

01:48.309 --> 01:49.109
Yeah.

01:49.210 --> 01:52.079
Do I have to eat it?

01:52.180 --> 01:53.914
Yeah, and you're
going to like it, see.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.384
And you're going to act
real surprised too, see.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.051
Do I get to still
have my grown up party

01:58.152 --> 01:59.119
tonight at the Lobo Lounge?

01:59.220 --> 02:01.255
If you're a very good boy.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.956
Hatcha.

02:03.056 --> 02:03.891
OK, Dad.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.293
Come with me.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.660
What?
Where we going?

02:06.760 --> 02:07.661
I can't tell you.

02:07.761 --> 02:08.729
It's a surprise.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.232
A surprise?

02:11.332 --> 02:12.700
For me?
- Come on.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.601
Close your eyes.

02:17.438 --> 02:22.276
Boy oh boy oh boy
oh boy oh boy oh boy.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.077
BOTH: Happy birthday, Dad!

02:24.178 --> 02:25.579
Oh, you guys.

02:25.679 --> 02:26.647
Look at this.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.015
You shouldn't have.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.951
Make a wish.

02:31.051 --> 02:32.119
What'd you wish for?

02:32.220 --> 02:35.256
He wished he was
still in his 20s.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.091
You wish I was
still in my 20s.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.427
How old is dad?

02:39.527 --> 02:41.662
Oh, he's this many.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.297
- Wow, that's old.
- Here, dad.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.198
Try some pancakes.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.132
Try the eggs.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.033
Oh, they look good.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.368
Happy birthday, Dad.

02:47.468 --> 02:50.204
[giggling]

02:50.304 --> 02:51.705
Oh, DJ.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.441
You shouldn't have.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.676
It's my hammer.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.110
Do you like it?

02:57.211 --> 02:59.513
I always have.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.982
[music playing]

03:05.386 --> 03:06.186
Oh.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.155
[ball bouncing]

03:09.156 --> 03:11.225
Yeah, that sounds great.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.060
Yeah, I'll ask my mom
and call you back.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.027
All right.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.128
No.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.430
You don't even know
what I was going to say.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.266
OK, what?
BECKY: That was Chip.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.600
No.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.435
He wants me to have dinner
over at his house tomorrow.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.070
No.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.038
He lives on Franklin Street
in a really nice house.

03:25.138 --> 03:25.939
Oh, OK.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.412
Chip says his parents
get together before dinner

03:31.512 --> 03:33.881
and talk over cocktails.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.949
I don't know if I
approve of that, Becky.

03:36.049 --> 03:40.621
His parents talk to each other?
- Mom, can I go?

03:40.721 --> 03:42.155
Please?

03:42.256 --> 03:43.291
Well, I don't know, honey.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.125
It's your first date,
and if you like it then

03:45.225 --> 03:47.428
maybe you'll want another one.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.929
BECKY: Mom.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.163
OK.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.265
Just this once.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.533
Thanks.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.001
Chip and his mom are
going to pick me up.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.369
Now I have to figure
out what to wear.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.137
Why don't you just try
wearing a bag over your head

03:57.237 --> 04:00.173
so they don't see
the way you chew.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.909
Shut up, Darlene.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.845
You're just jealous because
I'm dating and you're flat.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.079
Yeah.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.047
Oh, bite it.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.248
You bite it.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.149
Think fast.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.150
Ooh.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.053
DAN: I'm home.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.021
Oh.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.489
Hey, birthday boy.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.724
Think fast.

04:16.824 --> 04:17.725
Not now, baby.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.293
I can hardly move a muscle.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.395
You're not supposed to
be all sore and everything

04:21.495 --> 04:22.796
till after your party.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.132
Oh, I don't know how long I'm
gonna last at the Lobo tonight.

04:25.232 --> 04:26.266
Oh, come on.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.068
What happened to that
party monster I married?

04:28.168 --> 04:30.571
You know Vinny,
that new kid I hired?

04:30.671 --> 04:33.341
Oh, you mean that
19-year-old Adonis

04:33.441 --> 04:36.410
with the washboard stomach?

04:36.510 --> 04:37.345
You noticed.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.245
Noticed?

04:38.346 --> 04:41.315
Hell, I made sketches.

04:41.415 --> 04:44.017
Well, kid tried to
show me up at work today.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.287
If I picked up a sack of
cement, he picked up two.

04:47.388 --> 04:50.824
If I picked up six two by
fours, he picked up 12.

04:50.924 --> 04:54.094
And I showed him.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.829
Oh, you know what?

04:55.929 --> 04:58.599
A good vigorous massage
is what's really needed

04:58.699 --> 05:01.469
to save the evening here.

05:01.569 --> 05:02.636
Now where does that Vinny live?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.106
Oh, baby.

05:06.206 --> 05:07.408
I ain't the man I used to be.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.477
Yeah, but you
know, Dan, you were

05:09.577 --> 05:12.380
never the man you used to be.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.614
Get away from me.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.215
Get away from me.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.450
Let's face it, Dan, now.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.785
Come on, now.

05:17.885 --> 05:21.288
You kind of peaked at 18,
whereas I, on the other hand,

05:21.389 --> 05:22.723
have only begun to blossom.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.624
Hey, hey, hey.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.025
I ain't dead yet.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.995
There's still a few good
howls left in this old doggy.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.329
[howling]

05:29.430 --> 05:30.230
Come on.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.565
Let's go get your leash.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.934
[howling]

05:39.172 --> 05:40.340
OK.
OK.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.475
Mine next.

05:41.575 --> 05:42.610
Oh.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.144
Crystal, you don't have
to give him anything.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.078
You made him the cake.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.079
Well, that doesn't count.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.080
This is my real present.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.949
Holy cow.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.451
My company logo.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.319
Would you look at that?

05:52.420 --> 05:55.723
See-- see, you can keep warm
and advertise at the same time.

05:55.823 --> 05:56.624
I love it, darling.

05:56.724 --> 05:57.725
Thank you.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.326
All right, I think
this calls for a toast.

05:59.427 --> 06:03.030
Dan, I work with your wife 40
hours a week, and all I can say

06:03.130 --> 06:05.198
is that I have a lot
of respect for any man

06:05.298 --> 06:06.534
who could spend as
much time with her

06:06.634 --> 06:07.568
and not get paid for it.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.002
I'm sure you do.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.371
[cheering]

06:11.472 --> 06:13.240
I'll drink to that.

06:13.340 --> 06:16.810
Yeah, but you'd drink to
a parking ticket, Dwight.

06:16.910 --> 06:17.811
All right, all right.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.647
Now many of us
gathered here tonight

06:19.747 --> 06:22.750
may not realize that
Dan was actually Rosie's

06:22.850 --> 06:24.017
second choice as a husband.

06:24.117 --> 06:24.918
Really?

06:25.018 --> 06:25.819
Blasphemer.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.588
You swore you'd never tell.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.758
Yes, It was only after
Paul McCartney got married

06:30.858 --> 06:32.660
that she settled on Dan.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.694
It's true.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.028
I was the fifth Beatle.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.364
[chuckles]

06:38.499 --> 06:40.501
It's time to put
your hands together

06:40.601 --> 06:44.171
for a great father, a
wonderful humanitarian,

06:44.271 --> 06:46.206
and the only man I've
ever loved next to John,

06:46.306 --> 06:47.675
Paul, George, and Ringo.
- Danny, Danny.

06:47.775 --> 06:48.609
[applause and cheering]

06:48.709 --> 06:52.345
Ah, you don't
need no speeches.

06:52.446 --> 06:55.749
I just want to thank my special
girl, the light of my life,

06:55.849 --> 06:56.784
the fire of my loins.

06:56.884 --> 07:00.287
The washer of your shorts.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.456
To Rosie, who made
tonight possible.

07:02.556 --> 07:05.225
Yay, Rosie.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.194
Here's looking
at you, sweetheart.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.095
Hey, Bogart.

07:10.864 --> 07:11.732
Public place, man.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.567
How about keeping it down?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.903
[laughing]

07:16.003 --> 07:18.071
Get a grip.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.172
Aw, forget about it.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.474
He's cracked.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.542
Hey, come on.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.976
The pool game's almost over.
- Oh, yeah.

07:23.076 --> 07:23.877
Let's go get dibs.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.717
You guys almost finished?
- Yeah.

07:29.817 --> 07:30.751
OK.
Here's our quarter.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.253
We're next.

07:33.353 --> 07:36.156
Claire, who's
the steroid case?

07:36.256 --> 07:38.592
Oh, that's-- that's Bobo.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.628
He's with the snowplow show.

07:40.728 --> 07:43.664
We must have six of those
rowdies in here tonight.

07:43.764 --> 07:47.167
I can't wait till tomorrow
when they all leave town.

07:47.267 --> 07:50.103
Claire, did you put my
present for Dan in a safe place?

07:50.203 --> 07:51.004
Oh, yeah.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.205
It's in the back.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.641
Listen, I'm going to need
help bringing it out,

07:53.741 --> 07:55.943
so you keep Dan busy.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.444
Jackie, grab Booker.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.478
Hey, Daniel.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.813
What do you say we
make it interesting?

07:59.913 --> 08:02.182
It'd be interesting if you
knew how to play this game.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.551
Why you--

08:03.651 --> 08:04.885
[growling]

08:04.985 --> 08:07.420
Now, now, now, boys.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.623
Rosie, you did great.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.091
This is a swell present.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.460
You didn't see your
real present yet.

08:13.561 --> 08:14.361
Ooh.

08:14.461 --> 08:15.529
What'd you get me?

08:15.629 --> 08:17.230
Hey, come on Dan.
Tables free.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.198
Hey, hey.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.867
I'll take that.

08:19.967 --> 08:20.768
We got next game.

08:20.868 --> 08:21.669
No, no, no, no.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.070
See this is our quarter.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.237
Well, that's funny.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.040
I don't see your name on it.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.142
Why don't you just go sit down,
have a seat there, hot rod,

08:29.242 --> 08:31.912
and just stop embarrassing
yourself and everybody else.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.280
Aw, man.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.381
Come on.

08:34.481 --> 08:35.683
You've had a little
bit too much to drink.

08:35.783 --> 08:38.318
Why don't you just step
outside and get some air.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.087
You want to step
outside with me?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.421
I'd take on you and your hat.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.859
Hey, Jack.
The war is over.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.160
You can get parts
for your head now.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.767
Really funny, man.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.637
Dead man with a sense of humor.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.005
I got to go to
the bathroom, Dan.

08:58.105 --> 08:58.906
I'll be right back.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.109
That's great, Dwight.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.210
You go on to the bathroom.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.012
I'll rack them up.
DWIGHT: OK, buddy.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.585
I don't think you get it, pal.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.121
You want this table,
you gotta get past me.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.022
Well, that's fine.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.791
Hell, I got 10 seconds to spare.

09:17.891 --> 09:18.726
Hey!

09:18.826 --> 09:19.727
Dan, knock it off.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.328
Shut up, Roseanne!

09:21.428 --> 09:22.429
You promised me.

09:22.529 --> 09:23.964
You better mind your
little wife, tough guy!

09:24.064 --> 09:24.932
Don't push it, blondie.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.834
I'm leaving, do you hear me?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.802
I'm not gonna stand here
and watch you do this.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.276
[door slams shut]

09:48.789 --> 09:51.191
[thunk]

10:02.269 --> 10:03.971
You almost slammed
the car door on me.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.677
I thought you were going
to get out the other side.

10:09.777 --> 10:13.747
Not when it's wedged
against the garage.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.315
I'm gonna go
check on the kids.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.850
Oh, you're going to
go check on the kids.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.151
That's right.
I'm going to check on the kids.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.252
Have you got a
problem with that?

10:19.352 --> 10:21.621
No, I've got a
problem with you.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.357
You broke a promise
to me tonight.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.726
The hell I did.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.995
You promised me 10 years ago
you wouldn't fight no more.

10:28.095 --> 10:28.896
I didn't, did I?

10:28.996 --> 10:30.463
Yeah, because I stopped you.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.232
Roseanne, I wasn't
going to fight that guy.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.501
I had everything under control,
then you got in the way.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.169
Of what?

10:36.269 --> 10:37.537
I was psyching the guy out.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.172
Oh, I've heard
that one before.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.241
Oh, one minute you're
psyching the guy out,

10:41.341 --> 10:42.475
and then the next
minute you come up

10:42.575 --> 10:44.878
with your hand full of
teeth and your nose broken.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.580
And what are you bringing
up ancient history for anyway?

10:47.681 --> 10:48.648
Ancient history?

10:48.749 --> 10:49.817
You shoved the guy.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.184
He shoved me first.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.053
What am I supposed to do, stand
there in front of my friends

10:53.153 --> 10:55.488
looking like a weenie, which
is exactly what happened.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.957
I should've kicked
that guy's ass.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.863
Thank you.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.298
[music playing]

11:12.305 --> 11:13.673
[sighs]

11:13.774 --> 11:15.675
[banging]

11:15.776 --> 11:17.577
Mom, you've been yelling
at Dad for three years

11:17.677 --> 11:19.479
to finish the utility room.

11:19.579 --> 11:20.981
Why's he doing it now?

11:21.081 --> 11:21.949
None of your beeswax.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.125
[rattling drawer]

11:33.460 --> 11:34.728
So in other words,
something happened and you're

11:34.828 --> 11:35.929
not going to tell me.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.131
Right.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.233
Did you guys get in a fight?

11:40.333 --> 11:41.601
Yes, we did.

11:41.701 --> 11:46.373
He wants to keep you, but I
think we should give you away.

11:46.473 --> 11:51.111
Nobody tells me
anything around here.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.479
My blouse ready yet?

11:52.579 --> 11:53.546
Almost.

11:53.646 --> 11:54.948
What time is Chip
picking you up?

11:55.048 --> 11:55.849
Any minute.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.217
Just relax.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.752
Well, I should comb my hair
or something, don't you think?

11:58.852 --> 11:59.987
They shouldn't see me like this.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.789
Mom, he's not
going out with you.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.090
He's going out with me.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.292
I know, but my heart's
pounding a mile a minute.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.326
I mean, you're my daughter.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.028
You're going on your first date.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.262
Aren't you excited for me?

12:12.065 --> 12:14.902
Well, I was excited
at first, but now I just

12:15.002 --> 12:16.303
wish I could get out of it.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.537
Are you nuts?

12:17.637 --> 12:19.306
What do you want to
get out of it for?

12:19.406 --> 12:20.774
Chip's parents.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.475
I've never met them.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.779
I mean, I'm sure they're nice,
but what if they hate me.

12:25.879 --> 12:26.679
[drawer rattling]

12:26.780 --> 12:28.515
Or what if I hate them?

12:28.615 --> 12:31.618
Or what if we hate each other?

12:31.718 --> 12:32.519
Oh my gosh.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.355
I'm so confused.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.057
You've got nothing to
worry about, because you're

12:37.157 --> 12:39.726
gonna have a great time.

12:39.827 --> 12:40.828
What if they
serve me something

12:40.928 --> 12:45.065
that makes me gag, like okra?

12:45.165 --> 12:46.566
Well, just spit it
out into your napkin,

12:46.666 --> 12:49.469
you know, roll it up and
shove it in your purse.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.304
That's gross.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.207
Not if nobody sees you.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.108
Here you go.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.844
One blouse, medium rare.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.545
Thanks.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.814
Hey, do you want to borrow
my swankiest earrings?

13:00.914 --> 13:01.748
The silver ones?

13:01.849 --> 13:02.950
Yeah.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.517
They're on top of my
dresser in the jewelry box.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.418
I know.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.326
How we doing?

13:13.426 --> 13:14.227
I don't know.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.763
How are we doing?

13:16.864 --> 13:20.300
We've been better.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.703
Well, are you going
to meet Chip's mom?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.805
I guess.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.675
Well, do you think maybe you
should clean up a little bit?

13:28.775 --> 13:29.742
I don't know.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.144
Do you want me to
clean up a little bit?

13:31.244 --> 13:32.045
You do what you want.

13:38.886 --> 13:39.920
Hey, Rosie Poise.

13:40.020 --> 13:40.820
Hey, Dwight.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.789
Hey, Danny.

13:42.890 --> 13:43.656
Got you spackle.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.458
Oh, thanks.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.327
Mom, you got to go
upstairs and help Becky.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.796
She's having a
major hair trauma.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.164
What do I owe you?

13:51.264 --> 13:53.433
Hey, it's on the house, buddy.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.068
I just come over to check
on the slugger here.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.938
See how he's doing after the
big fight last night, yeah,

13:58.038 --> 13:59.439
You guys got into
a fight last night?

13:59.539 --> 14:00.340
Dwight.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.641
You could say that.

14:01.741 --> 14:02.675
Well, who won?

14:02.775 --> 14:03.743
Nobody won.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.678
You don't see any
scratches on us, do you?

14:05.778 --> 14:06.579
Your dad needs me.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.887
So Dad, you punched
some guy out last night?

14:13.987 --> 14:15.122
Nobody hit nobody.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.556
Dwight, hold this.

14:16.656 --> 14:17.690
Well, if you
didn't hit anybody,

14:17.790 --> 14:19.126
then how could you win a fight?

14:19.226 --> 14:21.594
Oh, your dad's
just being modest.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.363
He grabbed this guy,
smacked him around,

14:23.463 --> 14:24.264
threw him over the bar--

14:24.364 --> 14:26.033
Dwight, that's enough.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.168
Darlene, would you-- would you
go and sharpen this for me?

14:28.268 --> 14:29.302
I'm listening to--

14:29.402 --> 14:30.137
Darlene, would you do
what I tell you to do?

14:30.237 --> 14:31.038
Now move it.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.615
Why are you lying to my kid?

14:42.715 --> 14:43.984
Hey, don't get sore at me.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.785
I'm just trying to
make you look good.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.088
I don't need you to
make me look like a hero.

14:48.188 --> 14:51.959
Well, I couldn't tell
her what really happened.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.594
What really happened?

14:54.694 --> 14:56.129
Hey, the guy was
bigger than you.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.230
He was younger than you.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.033
You did the right thing, Dan.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.303
I didn't exactly see
you jumping in to help.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.206
Was your quarter.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.275
It was my quarter
and it was my fight.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.876
I handled it the
way I thought best.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.144
Hey, listen.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.146
If it makes you feel any
better, I told some of the guys

15:13.246 --> 15:14.647
down at the hardware store.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.516
Nobody thinks you were
a wimp for backing down.

15:16.616 --> 15:17.617
Dwight, shut up.

15:17.717 --> 15:18.785
Except Ted the key grinder.

15:18.885 --> 15:19.719
Dwight, get out.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.692
[door shuts]

15:26.693 --> 15:29.062
[sighs]

15:36.069 --> 15:38.438
[hammering]

15:52.252 --> 15:53.053
I gotta get some air.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.995
[door shuts]

16:02.095 --> 16:03.463
[doorbell ringing]

16:03.563 --> 16:06.399
I'll get it.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.867
Don't touch that door.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.069
Let Mom get it.

16:09.169 --> 16:09.969
Oh my gosh.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.104
I'm so nervous.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.439
Just don't shoot any
milk out of your nose

16:12.539 --> 16:13.340
and you'll be fine.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.078
Hi, Becky.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.180
Hi, Mrs. Conner.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.214
Hi, Chip.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.315
You look nice.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.816
I like your earrings.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.785
I like your sweater.

16:25.885 --> 16:26.853
Me too.

16:26.953 --> 16:27.920
You must be Roseanne.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.922
I'm Chip's mother, Bonnie.
- Hi, Bonnie.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.024
Nice to meet you.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.492
Oh, you'll have to
excuse the way I look.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.227
I just came from exercise class.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.399
Dan?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.700
I want you to meet my husband.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.635
Oh, I'd love to.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.272
So, are you guys going to
have a wild time tonight?

16:45.372 --> 16:47.407
Nah, we're just gonna eat some
steaks and watch some videos.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.375
Don't worry.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.277
We don't have
anything too risque.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.045
Well, not on a
first date, I'd hope.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.851
Where is your dad?

16:58.951 --> 17:00.453
Oh, he left.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.722
Why?

17:02.822 --> 17:06.926
Well, he got mad
at Dwight and threw

17:07.026 --> 17:09.496
his hammer through the drywall.

17:09.596 --> 17:10.963
Oh, well it is Saturday.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.637
Well, I think we
should be going.

17:17.737 --> 17:18.571
Have fun.

17:18.671 --> 17:19.472
Bye, mom.

17:19.572 --> 17:20.440
Nice to meet you, Bonnie.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.341
Bye.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.312
Darlene, watch DJ.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.414
I'm going to go get your daddy.

17:27.514 --> 17:28.581
Well, do you know where he is?

17:28.681 --> 17:31.784
I got a pretty good idea.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.254
[door shuts]

17:46.733 --> 17:47.834
Hey, Claire.

17:47.934 --> 17:48.735
Hi, Rosie.

17:51.938 --> 17:52.805
I knew it.

17:55.842 --> 17:56.676
Who's winning?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.145
Hi, baby.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.912
You wanna play?

18:00.012 --> 18:01.448
No.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.550
I'll just bug you for a while.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.219
[laughing]

18:09.156 --> 18:10.657
What happened with
you and Dwight?

18:10.757 --> 18:13.226
Nothing.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.561
Well, what are you doing here?

18:14.661 --> 18:15.462
We got beer at home.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.367
I don't know.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.268
I don't know.

18:24.971 --> 18:28.107
I just can't let it go.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.143
I keep playing last
night over in my head.

18:30.243 --> 18:37.116
I keep seeing that guy right
in my face, just asking for it,

18:37.217 --> 18:39.719
and I didn't do
anything about it.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.688
Are you still mad?

18:41.788 --> 18:42.589
No.

18:42.689 --> 18:43.590
How could I be mad at you?

18:43.690 --> 18:46.493
You got me off the hook.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.795
You didn't really want
to hit that guy, did you?

18:48.895 --> 18:51.030
Yeah, I wanted to
hit him all right.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.666
I just didn't want
him to hit me back.

18:53.766 --> 18:54.967
Well, I can understand that.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.404
Yeah, well I can't.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.139
You know, 10 years ago I never
would have thought about that.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.946
Honey, what's happened to me?

19:07.046 --> 19:11.083
Well, I mean,
the kids civilized

19:11.184 --> 19:12.285
you when you wasn't looking.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.023
Either that or
I'm getting old.

19:22.295 --> 19:26.466
Well, you wear it well.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.367
Thanks.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.573
You know the only
thing that matters to me

19:33.673 --> 19:36.142
is that you're here
for another birthday--

19:36.243 --> 19:37.043
mine.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.315
Hey, I love my present.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.550
You opened it?

19:43.650 --> 19:46.185
Hey, it had my name
on it, didn't it?

19:46.286 --> 19:48.087
Yeah, well it does
sort of remind me of you.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.557
You know, old and rusty and all.

19:53.526 --> 19:57.530
You really like me this way?

19:57.630 --> 20:00.433
Not really.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.068
Let's get outta here.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.345
Hey.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.813
It's Mr. Tough Guy.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.384
Hey, listen.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.886
Tell me something,
because I got to know.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.989
What do you and your fat
wife think of my new hat?

20:28.194 --> 20:30.897
Just this once.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.366
[smack]

20:35.468 --> 20:37.103
[thud]

20:37.203 --> 20:38.004
Let's get out of here.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.752
I can't believe you slammed
your hand in the car door.

20:52.852 --> 20:56.255
Well, accidents
will happen, princess.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.857
Now tell me about this date.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.492
I want to know everything.

20:59.592 --> 21:03.029
Oh, it was great, but
the dinner was awful.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.631
I don't understand
that, because I

21:04.731 --> 21:07.934
made sure I gave Chip's mom a
list of your favorite foods.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.836
You know, liver,
onions, cauliflower.

21:09.936 --> 21:13.340
Good thing I
brought my big purse.

21:13.440 --> 21:18.277
Yeah, well I've always said,
accessories make the woman.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.846
- Night, guys.
- Night.

21:19.946 --> 21:20.747
Good night, kitten.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.214
Let me see your hand.

21:22.315 --> 21:24.351
Ugh, it's still
pretty swollen.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.418
Yeah.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.387
Well luckily you still
got one good hand,

21:27.487 --> 21:30.256
so you could take
out the garbage.

21:30.357 --> 21:33.225
Did I ever tell you got
a great bedside manner?

21:33.326 --> 21:35.628
[kissing]

21:38.064 --> 21:39.432
Are you coming on to me?

21:39.532 --> 21:41.033
Oh, not tonight, baby.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.101
I can't move a muscle.

21:42.201 --> 21:43.235
Sure you can.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.136
See.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.606
[yelping]
