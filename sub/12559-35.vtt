01:34.636 --> 01:36.252
THANK YOU.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.635
ATTRACTIVE PLACE.

01:40.726 --> 01:43.434
THAT'S GRACIOUS OF YOU TO SAY SO.
VVHAT ELSE IS NEVV?

01:43.478 --> 01:46.015
YOU CAME INTO
TOWN THIS MORNING?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.598
IT'S, UM, AN
UNHAPPY PILGRIMAGE

01:48.650 --> 01:51.028
THAT I'M FORCED
TO MAKE EVERY WEEK.

01:51.111 --> 01:55.025
UNFORTUNATELY, NO ONE VVILL DELIVER MY
SUPPLIES, SO I HA\/E TO GET THEM MYSELF.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.449
OH, WAS THERE ANYTHING
ELSE, TROOPER FRANKLIN?

01:58.493 --> 02:00.530
UH, MR. BARTH DOWN
AT THE GENERAL STORE

02:00.621 --> 02:02.532
SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU TELLING HIM

02:02.623 --> 02:06.662
YOU'D SEEN SOME KIND OF
LIGHTS IN THE SKY LAST NIGHT.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.208
SO?

02:08.294 --> 02:11.663
WELL, I JUST
THOUGHT I'D, UH,

02:11.757 --> 02:14.169
COME UP HERE AND ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT IT.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.466
THAT'S INTREPID
OF YOU, TROOPER.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.798
I DID SEE
SOMETHING LAST NIGHT.

02:18.889 --> 02:23.053
AND I DID MENTION IT TO THAT PICKLE
BARREL VVHEELER-DEALER IN THE VILLAGE.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.977
I DID MENTION IT BECAUSE, VVELL, THE
GENERAL RUN OF DIALOGUE IS SO DULL

02:27.064 --> 02:29.681
IT MAKES ME VVANT TO RETIRE
FROM THE HUMAN RACE.

02:29.775 --> 02:32.483
I'M UP TO HERE IN
RAINFALL, WIND VELOCITY,

NEW INTO THE DIALOGUE.</i>

NEW YORK, MISS SCOTT?

02:58.553 --> 03:00.385

03:00.472 --> 03:04.090
<i>NO, NO, NOT AT ALL, I--
I WAS JUST INTERESTED.</i>

03:09.189 --> 03:13.103

FASHION EDITOR, VVEREN'T YOU?

03:13.193 --> 03:15.901
YES.

03:15.987 --> 03:20.026
I WAS SOME SORT
OF A FASHION EDITOR.

VVHY DON'T YOU, UH, RUN ALONG?

03:53.358 --> 03:55.941

<i>I DON'T THINK THERE
IS MUCH HERE FOR ME.</i>

03:58.363 --> 04:01.651
OR, FOR THAT

04:01.742 --> 04:04.825
<i>WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?</i>

04:04.911 --> 04:07.073
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO
MEAN THAT IN YOUR BOOK

04:07.164 --> 04:10.657
I'M SURE THAT ANYONE VVHO HASN'T
BOUGHT THEIR CLOTHES ON FIFTH AVENUE

04:10.751 --> 04:13.288
IS CONSIDERED
A BUMPKIN.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.587
<i>AND THAT EVERYBODY WHO DOESN'T BROADEN
THEIR As, IS CONSIDERED PROVINCIAL.</i>

04:16.630 --> 04:20.249
AND THAT ELUSIVE
THING CALLED CULTURE

AN INHERITABLE LEGACY

YOU'RE NOT FRIGHTENED,

I'M AFRAID YOU PUT ME IN THE
VVRONG SORORITY, MR. FRANKLIN.

I'M A CHARTER MEMBER,
BUT NOT OF SNOBS.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.648

CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD

05:14.731 --> 05:16.893

05:16.983 --> 05:19.361
SO FRIGHTENED THAT
THEY CAN'T FACE THE WORLD

05:19.444 --> 05:22.732
AND THEY GO AVVAY TO
LITTLE MOUNTAIN RETREATS.

05:22.823 --> 05:28.990
THEY ACT SUPERIOR BECAUSE THEY THINK
IT HIDES THEIR TENSIONS AND NEUROSES.

THANK YOU FOR
AN HONEST ANSWER.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.242
<i>WHY DON'T YOU RUSTLE UP SOME
HOT COFFEE FOR THE TWO OF US'?</i>

05:36.336 --> 05:38.373

THE NOISE

05:47.722 --> 05:50.931
A METEOR OR MAYBE AN

05:51.017 --> 05:54.430
THOSE WOULD BE THE
RATIONAL EXPLANATIONS.

THAT'S SHAKESPEARE,
MISS SCOTT.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.546
THAT'S SHAKESPEARE,
BUT WHAT IS THAT?

06:22.173 --> 06:25.541
<i>(narrator) THE MAJOR INGREDIENT
OF ANY RECIPE FOR FEAR</i>

06:25.594 --> 06:27.801

A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.946

06:47.032 --> 06:49.069

CLEARING IN THE SHADOWS

08:14.285 --> 08:17.653
NOT MUCH. YOU BETTER
GO BACK INSIDE.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.613
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.211
YOU BELIEVE THAT?

THAT'S ONE CONCESSION
TO PRIVACY THAT I DIDN'T MAKE.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.996
I'VE GOT A TELEPHONE
AND SOME COFFEE.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.584
AT THIS GIVEN MOMENT, BOTH
ARE LUXURY ITEMS IN MY BOOK.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.266
OH, UH, BETTER LOCK IT.

THAT I'\/E RACKED UP MORE
SCARED HOURS THAN MOST RABBITS.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.123
THANK YOU FOR

10:25.166 --> 10:28.500
MISS SCOTT, MAYBE YOU CAN LEARN
THIS, MAYBE lT'LL HELP YOU.

10:28.586 --> 10:32.545
BUT BEING FRIGHTENED IT'S A, IT'S
A NORMAL, NATURAL HUMAN FUNCTION

10:32.632 --> 10:35.215
LIKE, WELL,
JUST LIKE BREATHING.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.714
IT'S HOVV YOU REACT TO FRIGHT.
THAT'S VVHAT REALLY COUNTS.

10:38.805 --> 10:42.048
YOU CAN GET THE SHAKES
AND CRAWL UNDER A BED

10:42.142 --> 10:45.180
OR YOU CAN OLENOH YOUR FISTS
AND GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS.

10:45.270 --> 10:49.355
VVELL, YOU CAN CLENCH YOUR FISTS, BUT IF
YOU VVANT, I'LL BE HAPPY UNDER THE BED.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.978
BEING FRIGHTENED SURE HASN'T HURT
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR, HAS IT?

11:04.372 --> 11:06.409
YOU GOT TWO BEDS?

11:06.499 --> 11:09.491
I MIGHT LIKE TO DO A LITTLE
CRAWLING UNDER ONE OF THEM MYSELF.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.619
THERE WAS SOMETHING

15:11.702 --> 15:14.319
MOVED THE CAR BACK

YEAH, THAT'S VVHAT IT IS, ALL RIGHT. IT'S
A FOOTPRINT. LOOK AT THE SIZE OF IT.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.484
LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE, LET'S RUN.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.741
WHERE TO?

18:43.831 --> 18:46.789
TO THE VILLAGE, DOVVN THE ROAD. VVHO CARES?
SOMEVVHERE AVVAY FROM HERE.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.700
USE YOUR
HEAD, WILL YOU?

18:48.794 --> 18:51.286
IT'S 3O MILES
TO THE VILLAGE.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.291
<i>NO MATTER WHAT
DIRECTION WE TURN,</i>

18:53.341 --> 18:57.630
THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT HERE
AS HIGH AS A MOUNTAIN

18:57.678 --> 19:01.342
VVHO COULD JUST REACH DOVVN AND
CRUSH US VVITH HIS LITTLE FINGER.

19:01.432 --> 19:04.550
BLOCK OUR WAY
WITH HIS BIG TOE.

19:04.644 --> 19:08.478
THEN WHAT CAN WE DO?

19:08.522 --> 19:12.106
I CAN TRY AND FIX THAT CAR RADIO
AND PHONE IN FOR SOME HELP.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.692
YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU LIKE,

19:17.782 --> 19:21.150
BUT I'M NOT STAYING
HERE. I'M GETTING OUT.

19:21.202 --> 19:24.411
MISS SCOTT!
MISS SCOTT!

19:33.297 --> 19:35.629
[groaning]

19:44.392 --> 19:45.507
[shrieks]

19:57.488 --> 19:59.570
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.944
ALL RIGHT,
MISS SCOTT, TAKE OFF.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.867
I'LL TRY AND KEEP THIS
NIGHTMARE OCCUPIED.

20:04.954 --> 20:09.039
MAYBE YOU CAN REACH THE
VILLAGE AND GET SOME HELP.

20:09.083 --> 20:12.951
YOU THINK THEY'D E\/ER HEAR THE END
OF MY STORY BEFORE THEY LOCKED ME UP?

20:13.045 --> 20:16.538
<i>HONEY, THAT'S ONLY ONE OF
THE R\SKS WE HAVE TO TAKE.</i>

20:20.136 --> 20:22.878
WHY DOESN'T IT
DO SOMETHING?

20:22.930 --> 20:25.217
NOW, THAT'S
A GOOD QUESTION.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.891
BECAUSE IF IT VVANTED TO DESTROY US, IT
COULD HA\/E DONE IT A LONG TIME AGO.

20:28.936 --> 20:33.225
<i>US, THE VILLAGE DOWN BELOW
AND THE WHOLE STATE.</i>

20:33.274 --> 20:35.811
GO ON, MISS SCOTT,
TAKE OFF, WILL YOU?

20:35.901 --> 20:40.270
NO. NO, AS SCARED
AS I AM, I WANT TO STAY.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.732
YES, I-| WANT
TO STAY WITH YOU.

20:43.784 --> 20:48.244
ALL RIGHT. BUT I THINK I BETTER
FILL YOU IN ON SOMETHING.

20:48.330 --> 20:52.415
I'VE GOT TO FIGHT
THAT WITH THIS.

20:52.501 --> 20:56.495
THAT'S LIKE TRYING TO BRING DOVVN
A BOMBER VVITH A PEASHOOTER.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.297
BUT IT'S ALL WE'VE GOT.

[shouting]

21:57.983 --> 22:00.771
Oh. Oh.

22:08.536 --> 22:11.028
IT'S A BALLOON.

22:11.121 --> 22:14.830
<i>FANTASTIC.</i>

22:14.875 --> 22:17.833

<i>BUT THAT'S WHAT
IT IS. IT'S A BALLOON.</i>

22:21.048 --> 22:25.337
THAT'S IT? IS THIS VVHAT
VVE'\/E BEEN FRIGHTENED OF?

22:25.427 --> 22:28.089
A FUGITIVE FROM A
THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE?

22:32.059 --> 22:33.845
NOT QUITE.

22:40.818 --> 22:44.527
<i>[spaceship beeping]</i>

22:55.541 --> 22:57.498
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE
BEEN FRIGHTENED OF.

22:59.753 --> 23:02.165
TAKE A LOOK
AT IT, MISS SCOTT.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.714
LOOK AT THE SOURCE
OF OUR NIGHTMARE.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.883
<i>[tiny man's voice] GREA T LEADER,

23:14.894 --> 23:17.056
<i>MOVED IT BY MAGNET,

23:17.104 --> 23:20.392
ENTIRE OPERATION ENDED BY EARTH
MAN'S FAILURE TO BE FRIGHTENED.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.478
REPEAT, FAILURE
TO BE FRIGHTENED.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.309
REQUEST PERMISSION
TO DEPART EARTH.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.735
REPEAT, REQUEST PERMISSION
TO DEPART EARTH.

23:26.822 --> 23:30.611
PLEASE, OH, PLEASE, GREAT LEADER,
LET US DEPART BEFORE THEY CRUSH US.

23:30.701 --> 23:33.284
<i>[spaceship taking off]</i>

23:41.587 --> 23:45.956
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
I WISH THEM LUCK.

23:46.050 --> 23:50.089
MAYBE THE NEXT PLACE THEY
LAND, THEY CAN BE THE GIANTS.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.629
WHAT OF OUR
NEXT VISITORS?

23:52.723 --> 23:56.261
WHAT IF THEY
ARE GIANTS?

23:56.352 --> 23:59.470
VVELL, I THINK YOU'D SPIT IN THEIR EYE.
THAT'S VVHAT I THINK.

<i>(narrator) FEA R, OF COURSE,

<i>IT DEPENDS ON WHO CAN LOOK
DOWN AND WHO MUST LOOK UP.</i>

24:08.864 --> 24:13.028
<i>IT DEPENDS ON OTHER VAGARIES LIKE
THE TIME, THE MOOD, THE DARKNESS.</i>

24:13.118 --> 24:15.450
<i>BUT IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE
WITH GREAT VALIDITY</i>

24:15.537 --> 24:19.201
<i>THAT THE WORST THING THERE
IS TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF.</i>

BECOMES TO MUCH TO BEAR.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.720
OTHERS RETIRE
TO BEDROOMS.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.098
BUT THE CHILDREN ON NEXT
WEEK'S TW/L/GHTZONE

24:41.188 --> 24:43.475
FIND ESCAPE IN A MUCH
MORE UNUSUAL FASHION.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.351
THEY DISAPPEAR
IN A SWIMMING POOL.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.433

WORTH TO WATCHING.
