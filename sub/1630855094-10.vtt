There's darkness in the forest,

00:04.395 --> 00:06.615
nightmares you can't
even begin to imagine.

00:06.658 --> 00:10.227
[grunting, shouting]

00:10.271 --> 00:13.013
My blood
is your blood now.

00:16.886 --> 00:20.020
Every time I see something
really weird, I see this symbol.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.459
[screams]

00:24.501 --> 00:25.764
I've seen this.

00:25.808 --> 00:27.157
Like in a vision
or something?

00:27.201 --> 00:29.855
[Tabitha]
No, on the walls in the tunnels.

00:29.899 --> 00:32.119
Victor said his mother
wanted to rescue the children

00:32.162 --> 00:33.468
that were locked
in the tower,

00:33.511 --> 00:35.818
that it was the only way
to get everyone home.

00:35.861 --> 00:36.688
All this time I thought
the children

00:36.732 --> 00:38.168
were trying to scare me, but

00:38.212 --> 00:40.431
what if they're
just asking for my help?

00:40.475 --> 00:42.129
-[cicadas buzzing]
-Do you hear that?

00:42.172 --> 00:44.044
Help me!

00:44.087 --> 00:46.698
Please!
Please, I need help!

00:46.742 --> 00:48.874
She was talking in her sleep.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.441
What did she say?

00:50.485 --> 00:53.183
"They touch,
they break, they steal.

00:53.227 --> 00:55.968
No one here is free."

00:56.011 --> 00:57.144
[Boyd] There's something else
here now.

00:57.186 --> 00:58.841
Something new.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.886
It's not safe for anyone
to go to sleep tonight.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.192
-Every one of you...
-Get him upstairs!

01:02.236 --> 01:04.325
-...is gonna fucking die!
-Get him outta here now!

01:04.368 --> 01:05.978
[Elgin]
I just remembered my dream.

01:06.022 --> 01:09.199
There was this boy
all dressed in white,

01:09.243 --> 01:11.418
and he kept repeating
the same phrase.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.074
"Here they come..."

01:14.117 --> 01:15.466
-[cicadas buzzing]
-"...they come for three,

01:15.510 --> 01:17.512
unless you stop the melody."

01:17.555 --> 01:19.557
[choking]

01:19.601 --> 01:20.558
[Bakta]
I know that one.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.125
It's an old nursery rhyme.

01:22.168 --> 01:23.735
-[screaming]
-"They touch, they break,

01:23.779 --> 01:27.696

"Here they come,
they come for three,

01:30.612 --> 01:32.744

the melody."

01:32.787 --> 01:33.745

[screaming]

01:37.967 --> 01:43.059
[cicadas buzzing]

01:51.632 --> 01:52.808
They're upstairs.

01:54.244 --> 01:55.463
[door closes]

02:03.297 --> 02:04.472
Your mom and...

02:06.474 --> 02:08.911
...Victor took Ethan
to the diner.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.958
Hey, uh, Boyd--

02:14.003 --> 02:15.483
You should go upstairs just
in case they need your help.

02:30.628 --> 02:35.677
[cicadas buzzing]

02:38.245 --> 02:41.552
That kid should be
picking out a prom dress,

02:41.595 --> 02:44.512
not laying in there like...

02:46.862 --> 02:48.820
The problem is there's
too much we don't know.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.608
It's like opening a book
and starting from the middle

02:53.651 --> 02:56.959
or trying to imagine what
a jigsaw puzzle looks like

02:57.002 --> 02:59.222
when all you have
is a few random pieces, right?

02:59.266 --> 03:01.659
And not even the helpful ones,
like corners or edges.

03:01.703 --> 03:05.185
Just vague fucking...

03:07.796 --> 03:09.711
The trick is you find
two pieces that connect.

03:12.366 --> 03:14.324
Then at least you
have a place to start.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.460
[cicadas buzzing]

03:26.031 --> 03:27.859
Hey. Hey,
where are you going?

03:27.903 --> 03:29.208
We need to talk
to Sara.

03:30.340 --> 03:35.171
[cicadas buzzing]

03:35.215 --> 03:38.653
[engine rumbles]

03:45.007 --> 03:47.618
Well, if we can't
sleep anymore,

03:47.662 --> 03:49.881
then what's the point?

03:49.925 --> 03:51.883
I'm telling you,
we should all just fucking go.

03:51.927 --> 03:54.234
Get some supplies, set out,
and see what we can find.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.844
Boyd tried that already.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.628
Yeah, well,
maybe Boyd isn't the end-all,

03:57.672 --> 03:59.239
be-all answer
to everything.

03:59.282 --> 04:00.457
[sighs]

04:00.501 --> 04:01.458
What are we even doing
out here?

04:01.502 --> 04:02.981
Randall was an asshole.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.548
Yeah, well,
you're an asshole too,

04:04.592 --> 04:06.550
and I wouldn't leave
you out here to rot.

04:06.594 --> 04:07.812
Aw, fuck me.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.292
Finally got out
of my goddamn room

04:09.336 --> 04:12.252
and I'm on
corpse-collecting duty.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.254
Go check out down there.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.255
Elgin, this way.

04:17.518 --> 04:19.084
Appreciate you coming.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.564
It feels good to
do something useful.

04:20.608 --> 04:21.826
Oh, you've done plenty.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.306
That dream of yours,
for all we know

04:23.350 --> 04:25.352
that'll prove
to be the answer to this.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.703
Weird as that
fucking sounds.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.922
Yeah, maybe.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.447
[Dale]
You're gonna want to see this!

04:38.147 --> 04:40.367
I don't think
this guy's dead.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.629
Oh, shit.

04:44.414 --> 04:45.546
Fuck.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.897
Oh.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.073
Didn't you say there'd
be dead monsters out here?

04:51.116 --> 04:53.031
[exhales]

04:53.075 --> 04:54.729
So much
for silver bullets.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.427
Yeah.
Get him in the van.

04:57.471 --> 04:58.863
Aw, fuck.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.648
-Get him in the van!
-Okay.

[Boyd]
When we were in the forest,

07:53.429 --> 07:56.432
you said a little boy in white
told you to get into the tree.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.956
It's the same tree that
put me in the goddamn chamber

07:59.000 --> 08:00.915
where all this started.

-Well, it turns out

08:02.525 --> 08:05.441
Elgin had a dream about
a little boy in white,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.487
told him part of
a nursery rhyme,

08:07.530 --> 08:11.273
the same one Paula kept
repeating before she died.

was a little boy.

Hey, Sara, listen up.

This is it right now.

08:48.397 --> 08:50.355
When I told you there was
a chance that you could still

08:50.399 --> 08:52.401
do some good, that you could
help the people here...

08:53.663 --> 08:56.666
...it's right now,
you understand?

there was a...

there was someone chained
to a wall right here.

Then there was a hole

to town.

For setting it free.

it'll be too late.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.535
[panting]

11:50.579 --> 11:52.320
You need
to make it stop!

11:52.363 --> 11:53.930
Okay.
Make what stop?

11:53.974 --> 11:55.715
The music!
The music!

11:55.758 --> 11:57.194
You have to make
the music stop!

11:57.238 --> 11:58.500
Okay, how?

11:58.543 --> 12:00.502
How do I stop
something I can't see?

12:00.545 --> 12:01.633
-I don't know!
-Okay, okay, okay.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.505
-[screams]
-Oh. All right. All right.

12:03.548 --> 12:06.464
[screaming, crying]

12:06.508 --> 12:07.596
Okay.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.342
[woman]
Just breathe.

12:14.385 --> 12:17.388
[water bubbling]

12:17.432 --> 12:18.868
That's it.

12:18.912 --> 12:21.044
Just breathe.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.872
Close your eyes.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.395
Let's pray.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.747
Yea, though I walk through

12:27.790 --> 12:29.836
the valley of
the shadow of death...

12:31.620 --> 12:33.100
...I will fear no evil,

12:35.015 --> 12:38.758
for Thou art with me.

12:38.801 --> 12:42.457
Thy rod and Thy staff
they comfort me...

12:45.460 --> 12:46.591
Matthias?

12:48.898 --> 12:50.857
Take the guns
and lock them in the shed.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.337
I don't want them in the house.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.035
We managed to
make it through the night.

12:55.078 --> 12:56.558
Now we just have
to see about today.

12:56.601 --> 12:57.864
Okay.

13:11.573 --> 13:12.574
Jim.

13:13.618 --> 13:14.576
Come on.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.548
There's something
I have to do,

13:30.592 --> 13:31.898
and I need you
to say it's okay.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.466
The last time
Victor saw his mother,

13:35.510 --> 13:38.426
she told him that there were
children locked in a tower,

13:38.469 --> 13:41.342
that if she helped them,
then everyone could go home.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.127
I don't understand.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.913
All--all these children
I've been seeing,

13:46.956 --> 13:49.654
the dreams I've been
having about a tower...

13:51.700 --> 13:53.354
what if she was right?

13:54.398 --> 13:57.575
What if the only way to save
Julie is to find that tower?

13:57.619 --> 13:59.099
-Tabby--
-Honey, I know,

13:59.142 --> 14:01.841
-I know it sounds crazy.
-I had a theory about this place

14:01.884 --> 14:03.146
that almost got me killed.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.149
-Well, this is different.
-How?

14:09.544 --> 14:10.588
It just is.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.155
-[scoffs]
-Jim,

14:12.199 --> 14:13.940
our daughter
is laying in that room

14:13.983 --> 14:15.463
like something
out of a nightmare.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.988
She called for me
last night...

14:20.555 --> 14:22.862
and I couldn't do
anything to help her.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.691
I was just standing there...

14:28.824 --> 14:31.087
and all I could think
and see was

14:31.131 --> 14:33.220
Thomas lying on
the fucking floor.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.657
I can't.
I can't, Jim.

14:40.183 --> 14:42.664
We can't sit here
hoping for the best.

14:47.060 --> 14:50.237
Victor's mother left this place,
and she never came back.

14:52.239 --> 14:56.199
Whatever she went to do,
she never came back.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.201
[breathing unsteadily]

14:58.245 --> 15:01.030
Victor had to
grow up here alone.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.727
What if that happens
to you?

15:02.771 --> 15:04.512
I know.

15:07.689 --> 15:10.779
That's why I need you to tell me
that it's okay for me to go.

15:12.563 --> 15:14.870
I have to try this, Jim.
Please.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.919
When Julie wakes up,
she's gonna be hungry.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.138
We make her favorite.

15:22.182 --> 15:23.574
-Hey.
-We brought home food.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.185
Oh, good.

15:25.228 --> 15:28.753
Um, Victor, can I talk to you
for a minute, please?

15:28.797 --> 15:30.190
Is Victor in trouble?

15:31.278 --> 15:32.932
No, no.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.629
You come help me.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.029
Uh...

15:43.072 --> 15:45.205
You said your mother wanted
to rescue the children

15:45.248 --> 15:46.554
that were locked in the tower.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.387
Do you know
the way to the tower?

15:55.258 --> 15:56.042
Mm.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.396
But I-- I know the way...

16:03.832 --> 16:05.355
to the bottle tree.

16:05.399 --> 16:06.487
The what?

16:08.141 --> 16:09.142
[sighs]

16:13.624 --> 16:16.976
[murmuring]

16:21.284 --> 16:23.547
This is how you
get to the tower.

16:23.591 --> 16:27.290
You-- You have to
visit the bottle tree.

16:31.468 --> 16:32.817
Can you take me there?

16:34.254 --> 16:36.212
I think so.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.997
Can you give us a second?

16:45.961 --> 16:49.791
Jim, I have to try this.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.665
I have to at least try.

16:58.365 --> 16:59.540
I just...

17:01.629 --> 17:05.154
I know. I know.
I know, baby. I know.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.897
[exhales]

17:14.076 --> 17:16.165
[sobbing]

17:18.298 --> 17:19.690
So, what are we
supposed to do?

17:19.734 --> 17:22.911
[cicadas buzzing]

17:24.521 --> 17:26.523
We head back to town.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.177
Wait, wait, wait, what?

17:29.178 --> 17:31.311
She just said that
the music box is here.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.095
It's here.
We have to find it, we have to--

17:33.139 --> 17:34.531
Yeah, how do you
expect we do that?

17:34.575 --> 17:36.533
I don't know,

17:36.577 --> 17:38.057
but I'm pretty sure it's
not by going back into town!

17:39.406 --> 17:41.538
People's lives
are at stake here!

17:41.582 --> 17:43.758
Hey, I don't need a fucking
reminder of what's at stake!

17:48.850 --> 17:51.722
There's nothing we can do here.
Not yet.

17:51.766 --> 17:54.464
Look, we're dealing
with things

17:54.508 --> 17:55.726
that are beyond our scope
of...

17:58.512 --> 18:00.775
We know more now than
we knew this morning.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.082
That's a win.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.561
-Okay.
-Yeah.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.650
So, what are we--

18:06.694 --> 18:09.305
What are we supposed
to tell people?

18:09.349 --> 18:11.133
We tell people that
we are working on it.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.657
The best thing we can
do now is

18:13.701 --> 18:16.573
help people
feel a little more calmer,

18:16.617 --> 18:18.880
help 'em feel less afraid.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.099
Can you do that?

18:22.927 --> 18:25.060
Yeah. Yeah.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.193
Good man.

18:27.236 --> 18:31.588
[cicadas buzzing]

18:31.632 --> 18:35.070
[people chatting indistinctly]

18:36.158 --> 18:37.116
Hey.

18:40.641 --> 18:41.729
You all right?

18:43.731 --> 18:46.429
Why do people always ask that
when the answer's obvious?

18:50.999 --> 18:53.132
Look, man,
I'm sorry about last night.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.960
Putting you in that room,
we were just trying to--

18:56.004 --> 18:57.223
It was my fault.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.314
I lost my shit.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.015
Paula was the one
who was good in a crisis.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.240
I never realized
how fragile we are.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.634
How easily we break.

19:21.464 --> 19:24.119
I was downstairs
making dinner like an idiot.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.039
There was nothing
you could've done.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.129
This was nobody's fault.

19:38.655 --> 19:39.830
Yeah.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.269
Nobody's fault.

19:43.312 --> 19:44.183
Yeah.

19:52.713 --> 19:53.714
How's he doing?

19:56.543 --> 19:59.546
I just can't imagine what
I'd do if something like that...

20:01.722 --> 20:02.897
if it was you.
[exhales]

20:08.032 --> 20:09.338
[sighs]

20:09.382 --> 20:10.513
Hey, come here.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.566
It wasn't me.

20:24.745 --> 20:25.920
Let's get married.

20:27.530 --> 20:28.618
Today.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.054
[chuckles]
Yeah.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.013
Look, we have no idea
what's gonna happen,

20:32.056 --> 20:34.058
or if your dad's
gonna find a way to...

20:39.934 --> 20:42.023
[chuckles]
If this is the end,

20:42.066 --> 20:43.546
then I want it to end
with you.

20:46.767 --> 20:47.898
I wanna get married.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.341
Okay.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.472
Okay?

20:56.516 --> 20:58.692
[laughs]
Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.005
[knocking]

21:08.049 --> 21:08.963
[glass shatters]

21:11.139 --> 21:12.140
[glass rattling]

21:13.707 --> 21:14.882
[gasps]

21:21.932 --> 21:23.107
Uh...

21:30.332 --> 21:31.464
[glass shatters]

21:34.423 --> 21:35.381
[exhales]

21:43.084 --> 21:44.825
So, this is what
you're doing with my bar?

21:46.348 --> 21:47.871
It's a thought experiment.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.220
Ah.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.613
I used to find
this helpful

21:50.657 --> 21:52.006
when I was
developing my, um...

21:55.749 --> 21:57.403
You died.

21:57.446 --> 21:58.665
Correct.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.711
Okay.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.974
Well, just wanted to make
sure we were on the same page.

22:07.151 --> 22:08.152
[exhales heavily]

22:15.334 --> 22:18.467
Well, aren't you gonna
ask me if I'm real?

22:18.511 --> 22:21.383
I imagine this is some sort of
stress-induced psychosis,

22:21.427 --> 22:25.039
and you will disappear
soon enough on your own.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.389
So what's all this
supposed to do?

22:27.433 --> 22:30.131
It's a way of
reorienting my perspective.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.002
I'm trying to...

22:32.046 --> 22:36.311
trying to find a different
way to look at this symbol.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.008
Why?

22:38.052 --> 22:39.358
[sighs] Why...

22:42.230 --> 22:44.624
Because I've been
looking at it wrong.

22:44.667 --> 22:45.668
[exhales]

22:47.670 --> 22:49.019
There's gotta be
an answer here, I'm just--

22:49.063 --> 22:50.499
I'm not seeing it.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.807
[sighs]

22:56.549 --> 22:57.724
You know I just thought--

22:58.855 --> 22:59.726
What? What is it?

23:00.988 --> 23:01.989
You changed the still.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.687
You're welcome.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.736
I think
you're overthinking it.

23:12.042 --> 23:14.741
Oh, do you, Dead Tom?

23:15.829 --> 23:18.005
In what way? Hm?

23:18.048 --> 23:20.529
You already know
what you have to do.

23:20.573 --> 23:23.358
Tabitha told you she saw this
symbol down in the tunnels.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.708
The question is,

23:25.752 --> 23:27.536
how far are you willing
to go to find answers?

23:27.580 --> 23:29.538
Going down into those
tunnels would be insane.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.498
Even if it saves
Julie's life?

23:32.541 --> 23:34.630
Oh, fuck.

23:34.674 --> 23:37.198
You know, I don't even know
if I'd find anything down there!

23:37.241 --> 23:39.113
Of course you do.
It's natural design.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.725
Same reason your
brain's in your skull,

23:42.769 --> 23:44.248
your heart's behind your ribs.

23:45.598 --> 23:47.164
Nature will always
put what's most precious

23:47.208 --> 23:49.079
in the spots most
difficult to reach.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.823
Nothing about this place
is natural.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.477
Wrong.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.436
Nothing about this place
is familiar.

23:59.307 --> 24:00.439
There's a difference.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.353
[exhales heavily]

24:02.397 --> 24:04.138
If there's answers
to be found...

24:06.793 --> 24:09.317
and granted, that's a--
that's a big if...

24:10.579 --> 24:11.885
that's where they'll be.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.756
All right,
so I'm supposed to what?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.454
I'm supposed to
take advice from some...

24:16.977 --> 24:20.459
You ran into a house
that was falling down

24:20.502 --> 24:24.288
to save Tabitha
and she wasn't even there.

24:24.332 --> 24:25.942
And you know what?

24:25.986 --> 24:28.205
Given the choice,
I'd do the same thing again.

24:28.249 --> 24:31.121
Well, then you're
a fucking idiot. Like--

24:31.165 --> 24:32.471
[laughs]

24:32.514 --> 24:35.082
[both laughing]

24:36.823 --> 24:38.477
You don't make
moral choices based

24:38.520 --> 24:39.739
on the outcomes you expect.

24:41.262 --> 24:42.393
You make them
based on whether or not

24:42.437 --> 24:43.612
you think they're right.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.095
When I ran into that house,
I wasn't thinking

24:48.138 --> 24:50.314
about the Trolley Problem,
or determinism, or...

24:51.968 --> 24:53.361
wasn't thinking
of any of that.

24:55.363 --> 24:57.844
There's a 16-year-old girl
over there who needs your help.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.200
Did you bury Paula?

25:09.986 --> 25:11.510
What?

25:11.553 --> 25:12.946
Did you bury Paula yet?

25:14.208 --> 25:16.253
Jesus Christ.

25:16.297 --> 25:18.081
I'll do it.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.779
I'll go and find
some people to help.

25:28.483 --> 25:29.484
Boyd?

25:29.528 --> 25:30.659
Yeah.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.401
You're doing
the best you can.

25:41.061 --> 25:43.324
[door opens]

25:46.327 --> 25:47.633
Fuck it!

25:51.419 --> 25:54.161
[bell clanging]

25:56.598 --> 25:59.035
[clanging]
