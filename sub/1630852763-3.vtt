00:14.807 --> 00:16.267
I know you're scared,

00:16.267 --> 00:17.560
- but I'm...
- Scared?

00:17.560 --> 00:18.769
It's natural. When someone

00:18.853 --> 00:19.895
has an attempt
made on their life...

00:19.979 --> 00:21.313
You know I was recruited

00:21.397 --> 00:23.649
by the FBI
and Central Intelligence?

00:23.733 --> 00:25.860
Scored a 99th percentile in IQ,

00:25.860 --> 00:27.486
but only an 80%
on the psych eval.

00:27.570 --> 00:30.906
You want to know why,
you condescending asshole?

00:30.990 --> 00:33.784
Interpersonal skills?

00:33.868 --> 00:37.913
I lack the ability
to tolerate horseshit.

00:37.997 --> 00:40.332
And this...

00:40.416 --> 00:43.085
and this... is horseshit!

00:43.169 --> 00:45.755
You think I'm some poor,
scared, little girl?

00:45.755 --> 00:47.590
I'm not scared. I am pissed.

00:47.590 --> 00:48.799
They came into my house

00:48.883 --> 00:50.551
that I fixed up with my money

00:50.551 --> 00:51.886
in the town
that my family founded

00:51.886 --> 00:53.387
because they think
they are untouchable.

00:57.016 --> 00:58.309
You want a gun?

00:58.309 --> 01:00.561
Uh-huh.

01:01.604 --> 01:03.105
Fine by me.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.657
Gray gave this to me
a couple of years ago.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.785
Wanted to keep it
in the family,

01:15.785 --> 01:17.161
and I was
the only family he had.

01:18.162 --> 01:20.414
Not what you'd call
a subtle weapon.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.335
People round here
know I have this thing.

01:24.335 --> 01:26.086
Use it wrong,
and it gets back to me.

01:28.881 --> 01:31.008
So don't use it wrong.

01:31.008 --> 01:34.178
I won't let
anything happen to it.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.071
Your house isn't safe anymore;
pack your bags.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.328
Finlay?

01:59.328 --> 02:01.330
Got an ID on the body
that was found with Joe.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.957
We gotta get to the morgue.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.095
Are you kiddin' me?

02:16.095 --> 02:18.472
I just told you to be careful
with that thing.

02:18.556 --> 02:21.225
Never trust a weapon you
haven't personally test-fired.

02:48.252 --> 02:50.087
You two were already
working the case?

02:50.087 --> 02:51.213
First thing in the morning?

02:51.297 --> 02:53.090
We were just getting
back into town.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.550
From where?

02:54.550 --> 02:58.846
Alabama. Bar closed late,
storm flooded the road.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.432
You took him out drinking?

03:01.432 --> 03:03.893
Isn't that the exact opposite
of what I told you to do?

03:03.893 --> 03:05.352
Good thing I did.

03:05.436 --> 03:07.229
Whoever killed the Morrisons
came after us last night.

03:07.313 --> 03:09.315
Broke into my house,
carved a threat into my door;

03:09.315 --> 03:11.191
who knows what they would've
done if I'd been there alone.

03:11.275 --> 03:13.027
They came into your house?

03:14.069 --> 03:15.696
I'm fine.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.990
Let's just see
what Jasper has for us.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.992
It's okay.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.244
I had my eye on her.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.876
Here you go.
Here you go.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.253
Sorry; I didn't know
you were coming.

03:31.337 --> 03:33.547
Once the prints came back,
we got a full run on the man.

03:33.631 --> 03:35.925
Victim's name is Pete Jobling.

03:35.925 --> 03:38.636
Trucker for Southfreight
Shipping, which makes sense,

03:38.636 --> 03:40.262
'cause the test results
I got back

03:40.346 --> 03:41.805
showed a little too much
hydrogen sulfide

03:41.889 --> 03:43.515
in his blood gases and tissue;

03:43.599 --> 03:45.225
he spent his whole life
on the road,

03:45.309 --> 03:47.019
sniffing other people's
catalytic converters.

03:47.019 --> 03:49.647
43, married,
resides in Atlanta...

03:49.647 --> 03:51.565
Record's clean
except for a 2018 arrest

03:51.649 --> 03:53.442
for a Jacksonville
traffic violation

03:53.442 --> 03:55.110
that turned into
a disorderly conduct.

03:55.194 --> 03:58.739
Defended by Zacarias
Perez LLP. No conviction.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.282
Zacarias Perez. Here he is.

04:00.366 --> 04:02.701
Oh. Looks fancy.

04:02.785 --> 04:05.120
Not the kind of firm
that defends truck drivers.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.830
Thanks, Jasper.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.124
Hopefully we don't need
to see you again any time soon.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.709
Yeah.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.339
It's a D.C. number.

04:15.339 --> 04:17.466
- Secret Service.
- Hello?

04:17.466 --> 04:19.051
Officer Conklin?

04:19.051 --> 04:20.552
This is Molly Beth Gordon,

04:20.636 --> 04:22.930
Specialized Administrative
Officer with the Secret Service.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.431
I got your message
regarding Joe Reacher.

04:24.515 --> 04:25.474
<i>I work with him.</i>

04:25.474 --> 04:26.600
Uh, hi, Molly Beth.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.519
Oh, Joe!

04:28.519 --> 04:30.771
Oh, thank God.
Why haven't you

04:30.771 --> 04:32.481
<i>returned my calls?
I was so worried.</i>

04:35.567 --> 04:38.487
Ms. Gordon,
this is Jack Reacher.

04:38.487 --> 04:41.156
Joe's brother.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.992
Joe's dead.

04:44.243 --> 04:46.787
No.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.580
No, you're wrong.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.124
I'm not.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.794
How?

04:55.587 --> 04:57.089
He was murdered.

04:57.089 --> 05:00.009
<i>We think his death
may be related to his work.</i>

05:00.009 --> 05:01.969
<i>Do you know what Joe was doing
in Margrave, Georgia?</i>

05:01.969 --> 05:04.179
Uh... I don't know.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.931
He was, um...

05:06.015 --> 05:08.058
He was running
a classified investigation,

05:08.142 --> 05:10.811
I just don't know the details...

05:10.811 --> 05:11.937
God.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.404
I know it's not the best time
to answer questions,

05:20.404 --> 05:22.281
but we really need your help.

05:22.281 --> 05:25.075
<i>What position did Joe hold
in the Secret Service?</i>

05:25.159 --> 05:26.410
What? He was...

05:26.410 --> 05:28.495
Uh, he was, he was the,
he was the director,

05:28.579 --> 05:31.290
he was the director of
the Office of Investigations.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.208
You... you didn't know that?

05:35.127 --> 05:36.670
No.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.630
We hadn't spoken in a while.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.382
Was anyone working under him?

05:40.466 --> 05:42.051
No.

05:42.051 --> 05:44.553
No, um...

05:44.553 --> 05:46.764
No, he assigned
his current case to himself.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.015
<i>Nobody knew about it.</i>

05:48.015 --> 05:49.349
You did.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.853
We were close.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.856
Molly Beth, um,
this is Officer Conklin.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.025
I'm-I'm sorry,
we're almost done, I promise.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.402
Was there a specific
division of O.I.

06:00.486 --> 06:01.987
that Joe was heading up?

06:02.071 --> 06:04.531
Uh, yeah, he-he runs...

06:04.615 --> 06:07.576
he ran our
anti-counterfeiting department.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.414
Agent Gordon?

06:12.498 --> 06:15.250
Captain Finlay,
Chief Detective, Margrave PD.

06:15.334 --> 06:16.585
Had there been reports

06:16.585 --> 06:17.878
of counterfeiting
in the Margrave area?

06:17.878 --> 06:19.630
I... I really don't feel like...

06:19.630 --> 06:21.423
Can we just talk about this
another time, please?

06:21.507 --> 06:23.801
I know it's hard,
and I hate doing this,

06:23.801 --> 06:25.844
considering what we just told you,

06:25.928 --> 06:27.554
but you're our only lead.

06:27.638 --> 06:30.516
<i>On a case it appears
Joe died for.</i>

06:30.516 --> 06:32.643
Um... Okay.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.648
Joe told me that he put a stop

06:37.648 --> 06:41.652
to all domestic counterfeiting
a while ago. Um...

06:41.652 --> 06:43.320
He put all
these procedures in place;

06:43.320 --> 06:44.780
made it basically impossible

06:44.780 --> 06:46.406
to make anything here
without getting caught.

06:46.490 --> 06:49.076
<i>He was chasing
international stuff.</i>

06:49.076 --> 06:50.077
Like South America?

06:50.077 --> 06:53.372
I don't know. Um...

06:53.372 --> 06:55.332
I can try to get
his files for you.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.416
Thank you.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.876
But hard copies only;

06:57.960 --> 06:59.670
we don't want a digital trail.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.380
Why?

07:01.380 --> 07:03.340
Seems whatever Joe was into,
people were killed over it.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.259
We don't want anything
leading back to you.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.635
We need to keep this quiet.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.512
Shouldn't I tell his superiors?

07:08.512 --> 07:09.847
Absolutely not.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.391
We can't trust
the Secret Service?

07:12.391 --> 07:15.269
Joe kept this top secret
for a reason.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.729
I believe in my brother's
instincts. Do you?

07:17.813 --> 07:19.898
Yes. <i>- Okay, good.</i>

07:19.982 --> 07:21.608
So we tell no one until
we have a better understanding

07:21.692 --> 07:23.235
of what we're dealing with.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.778
Okay. Um...

07:24.862 --> 07:27.531
it'll take me a day or so
to copy it all.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.158
That's okay.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.412
You sound just like him.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.417
We'll talk soon.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.840
Your counterfeiting guess
was right, Reacher.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.009
My bet was guns
or sex trafficking.

07:47.009 --> 07:49.136
Well, like you said,
everything comes down to cash.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.180
Counterfeiters just cut
out the middle man.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.974
But multiple murders
over Monopoly money?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.809
People kill over 20 bucks
in a wallet.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.686
Imagine what they'd do
to protect a limitless supply.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.771
We don't have to imagine; we've
been to the Morrisons' house.

07:59.855 --> 08:02.441
No way it's a coincidence
Hubble was a currency manager

08:02.441 --> 08:04.276
for Axis Financial's
Atlanta branch.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.527
Okay, so we check out
where he worked.

08:05.611 --> 08:07.529
I go there midday
flashing a badge,

08:07.613 --> 08:09.156
people clam up and lawyer up.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.074
I'll track down
some of the suits after hours.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.534
- Mm.
- But right now,

08:12.618 --> 08:14.411
I need you back in uniform
and at the station house.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.914
Pretend to look for the ex-cons
who killed the Morrisons.

08:16.914 --> 08:18.707
I'm sorry, what?

08:18.707 --> 08:20.334
Teale doesn't know
we suspect him,

08:20.334 --> 08:21.752
so we play his game for now.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.462
I'll tell him you found
your house broken into

08:23.462 --> 08:25.130
and you're determined
to find out who's responsible.

08:25.214 --> 08:27.299
So I get to watch Teale waving
his cane like a scepter,

08:27.299 --> 08:28.842
playin' boss;
what do you get to do?

08:28.926 --> 08:31.136
I'm going to pay a visit
to that jail guard, Spivey.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.055
Got his address this morning.
Next county over.

08:33.055 --> 08:34.139
I'll come.

08:34.223 --> 08:36.266
'Cause it went so well
the last time?

08:36.350 --> 08:39.102
No, you're gonna to go see
Zacarias Perez LLP.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.104
See what you can find out
about Jobling's arrest.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.731
An assignment?

08:42.731 --> 08:44.107
I thought I was not--

08:44.191 --> 08:45.609
by employment, appearance,
or lifestyle choice--

08:45.609 --> 08:46.693
a cop anymore.

08:46.777 --> 08:48.987
Well, shows you
how desperate I am.

08:49.071 --> 08:51.073
So be smart,
don't break the law,

08:51.073 --> 08:54.076
and promise me you won't
end up in another holding cell.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.954
No.

08:58.664 --> 09:01.250
Can't wait till this is over
and that guy's out of our town.

09:07.256 --> 09:09.007
Officer Conklin.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.885
Keeping banker's hours?

09:11.969 --> 09:13.428
I was at the morgue,

09:13.512 --> 09:15.222
getting intel
on the second highway victim.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.849
I made my directive clear.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.768
Those bodies take a backseat

09:19.768 --> 09:21.770
to those of our departed
colleague and his wife.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.897
A cop is dead,

09:23.981 --> 09:25.190
and from what I've heard,
we could've had another.

09:25.274 --> 09:26.358
You holdin' up all right?

09:26.358 --> 09:28.443
Yes, sir.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.279
Though if I had been home,
I would've taken

09:30.279 --> 09:31.905
at least a couple
of those bastards with me.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.532
That's the spirit, kid.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.993
If someone wants to come
after Margrave's finest,

09:35.993 --> 09:37.536
they better be ready
for a fight.

09:37.536 --> 09:40.247
Now, I want you focused on

09:40.247 --> 09:43.917
some of the more violent perps
Morrison helped incarcerate.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.877
Aggravated battery,

09:45.961 --> 09:48.046
domestic assault,

09:48.130 --> 09:50.549
armed robbery.
Bad men.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.175
Copy that.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.885
I'm in the process
of running down

09:53.969 --> 09:55.554
stolen car reports
for the whole county.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.097
Figure if an ex-con was gonna

09:57.097 --> 09:58.432
go to a cop's house,
he wouldn't risk

09:58.432 --> 09:59.766
using his own ride.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.143
Well, that's good thinkin'.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.894
You keep me posted.

10:02.978 --> 10:04.313
Hmm.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.241
Roscoe?

10:17.451 --> 10:18.660
You were with
Finlay this morning?

10:18.744 --> 10:20.329
I was.

10:20.329 --> 10:23.498
And, uh...
someone came after you?

10:23.582 --> 10:24.958
Appears that way.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.335
Could be related to Morrison,

10:26.335 --> 10:27.961
could be teens with
a fucked-up sense of humor.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.589
Yeah. Um...

10:30.589 --> 10:33.675
My cousin Charlie's
not picking up her phone.

10:33.759 --> 10:36.428
Paul, either.
The whole family's disappeared.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.181
Just wondering if you know
something I don't.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.808
No.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.143
Do you?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.270
Nope. I'm just trying

10:45.354 --> 10:47.022
to figure out what the hell's
going on around here .

10:47.022 --> 10:48.940
Yeah. Me, too.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.693
I haven't had any luck,
so I'm just gonna

10:51.777 --> 10:54.446
focus on the ex-cons,
like Teale said.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.531
You really think
that's the way to go on this?

10:56.615 --> 10:59.242
Good a road as any.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.119
Teale's boss now.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.082
What about Finlay?

11:05.082 --> 11:06.833
Think he might know something
he ain't sharing?

11:06.917 --> 11:08.502
I doubt it.

11:08.502 --> 11:11.254
Everybody in Margrave still
treats him like the new guy.

11:11.338 --> 11:15.384
Yeah. Well, whole town's wound
tighter than jungle gym screws.

11:15.384 --> 11:18.261
I don't know what
to tell my wife.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.555
This Reacher guy's
running all over everybody

11:20.639 --> 11:22.182
- like it's...
- Stevenson?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.934
A moment.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.894
Yes, sir.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.605
Mr. Spivey?

12:14.443 --> 12:16.278
Tanner Spivey?

12:29.291 --> 12:31.334
Mr. Spivey?

13:31.353 --> 13:32.687
Alton police!

13:33.939 --> 13:36.024
- You picked the wrong town to rob in.
- Wait!

13:38.777 --> 13:40.570
Those bruises
look pretty fresh.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.988
You still feelin' 'em?

13:42.072 --> 13:43.532
A bit.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.327
The accident was
just a few days ago.

13:49.913 --> 13:53.625
Well, truth be told,
Mr. Doyle...

13:53.625 --> 13:56.253
I'm sorry, what was your
first name again?

13:56.253 --> 13:58.672
Uh, Brian.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.465
Truth be told, Brian,

14:00.549 --> 14:02.842
we don't normally handle
auto claims here.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.678
Usually leave that to
the bus bench crowd.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.597
But The Home Depot's
got deep pockets

14:07.681 --> 14:10.892
and I intend to get my hands
all the way in 'em,

14:10.976 --> 14:13.270
get you the recovery
you deserve.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.730
So, let's start
at the beginning.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.400
What was the date
that delivery truck hit you?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.193
There was no truck.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.571
I made up a story
so you'd see me.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.197
Now get me your file
on Pete Jobling.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.491
Excuse me?

14:26.575 --> 14:28.952
A client you represented
for a traffic violation

14:28.952 --> 14:31.162
and disorderly conduct charge.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.831
His file.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.416
Get it.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.793
I don't know what game
you're playing at here,

14:36.793 --> 14:38.503
but get out of my office.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.088
No.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.464
Excuse me?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.174
Who the hell
do you think you are?

14:43.258 --> 14:45.594
A pissed-off drifter
with nothing to lose.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.345
Oh, you want to get arrested
for trespassing?

14:47.429 --> 14:49.097
Pull up Jobling's file. Now.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.976
I will ruin your life
with one phone call.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.353
I'll end your life
with one phone.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.612
Pull up Jobling's file.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.867
Print it.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.038
Staple.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.999
Little further.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.335
Here you go.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.757
Thank you.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.927
Oh.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.096
Don't bother trying
to find out my real name.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.723
Cause any problems,

15:31.723 --> 15:33.642
you'll wish
I'd finished strangling you.

15:47.447 --> 15:51.326
Listen, man, you should've
told us you were a cop.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.329
Hard to do
with a boot in your mouth.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.012
And it shouldn't make
a difference.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.357
Jesus.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.110
Which one of you assholes
did this?

16:25.110 --> 16:27.153
Thought he was a burglar.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.614
How many burglars you know
wear suits?

16:29.698 --> 16:31.366
He didn't look
like he lived there.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.743
- Are you fuckin' kidding me right now?
- Hey.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.120
Let it go.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.579
We have bigger fights.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.874
Come on. Come on.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.127
Come on.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.508
You know, cursing is
a sign of a weak mind

16:48.508 --> 16:51.094
and a weaker character.

16:51.094 --> 16:54.139
But I appreciate
you having my back.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.640
Of course.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.767
You hear from Reacher?

16:57.851 --> 16:59.519
We're meeting him at Jolene's.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.645
Said he found something.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.314
Good. 'Cause so did I.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.908
<i>♪ I been doing everything
for you</i> ♪

17:16.119 --> 17:17.996
<i>Even took up all day ♪</i>

17:20.123 --> 17:21.791
<i>♪ Well, I guess that...</i>

17:21.875 --> 17:23.585
Cops or civilians?

17:23.585 --> 17:25.920
Just Southern hospitality.

17:26.004 --> 17:28.256
How'd it go at the law firm?

17:28.256 --> 17:30.091
Got everything I needed.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.217
How?

17:31.301 --> 17:34.387
Just... used the phone.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.017
Two fried chicken thighs,
fried okra, ribs,

17:39.017 --> 17:41.978
collard greens, pole beans,
rice with giblet gravy,

17:41.978 --> 17:43.229
cottage cheese and peaches.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.982
Buttermilk chicken sandwich
with coleslaw.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.611
And for you, spinach salad.
Dressing on the side.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.821
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.907
I was embarrassed ordering that.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.451
How do you eat like that
and still look like you do?

17:56.451 --> 17:58.453
Like this.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.042
So, Roscoe says
you found something.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.713
Our dead trucker's employer,
Southfreight Shipping?

18:08.797 --> 18:10.965
They were contracted to
Kliner Industries.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.301
When our trucker got into
legal trouble,

18:13.301 --> 18:15.261
Kliner paid his legal fees.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.222
That makes what I came across
even more interesting.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.224
- What's that?
- I searched Spivey's house.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.226
Looks like he left town.

18:21.226 --> 18:23.645
But his landline showed multiple
calls to Kliner Industries.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.688
So, roads are leading to Kliner.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.273
The patron saint of Margrave?

18:27.357 --> 18:29.025
You really think that
he could be counterfeiting?

18:29.025 --> 18:31.611
Who knows? He certainly has
the financial resources

18:31.611 --> 18:32.987
to pull off something
of this scale.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.739
Maybe he has those resources

18:34.823 --> 18:37.367
- because he's counterfeiting.
- Mm.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.077
Well, how does Hubble's
bank fit into all this?

18:39.077 --> 18:42.372
Not sure. But I'm gonna break
into Kliner's tonight

18:42.372 --> 18:44.123
and see if I can find something
that connects them.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.084
You can't just sit there
and say you're gonna violate

18:46.084 --> 18:48.294
the Fourth Amendment
while you eat okra.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.879
Yes, I can.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.465
- Wanna see me do it again?
- Reacher...

18:52.549 --> 18:54.717
I don't know what we'll find
or not find.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.886
Things maybe lead to Kliner.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.096
We're flying blind here,

18:58.096 --> 18:59.931
so somebody's gotta kick
the hornet's nest.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.766
You jeopardize this
investigation

19:01.850 --> 19:03.476
if you get evidence
that's inadmissible

19:03.560 --> 19:05.645
because it was
unlawfully obtained.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.356
You get that busted nose
filling out a warrant

19:08.356 --> 19:09.899
to search Spivey's house?

19:09.983 --> 19:12.193
A man who may have information
regarding a murder

19:12.277 --> 19:13.653
had disappeared.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.696
He didn't return my calls,

19:14.696 --> 19:15.947
so I went to his house.

19:15.947 --> 19:18.825
No answer there, despite
it being mid-afternoon,

19:18.825 --> 19:20.827
and he not reporting to work
that day.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.830
I had a reasonable belief
that Spivey could be in danger.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.499
- Mm.
- Exigent circumstances are exceptions

19:26.583 --> 19:27.709
to the warrant requirement.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.920
Exigent circumstances?
That's bullshit.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.464
Maybe. But it's legal.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.133
Okay, fine.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.968
I won't break into
Kliner's office.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.345
I'll walk in
and talk to him. Now.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.389
I'm coming.
A man that powerful,

19:41.389 --> 19:43.182
someone's gotta keep
a cool head.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.560
Okay, I think
I know what's going on here,

19:45.560 --> 19:47.687
but if you two can't play nice,
I'm gonna do what Meemaw used to

19:47.687 --> 19:50.064
and make you sit on the ground
and hold hands.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.695
Okay... eat it or clean it up.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.739
Jolene's not your mama.

20:00.033 --> 20:03.244
I gotta go keep tracking down
those rental cars. Bye.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.084
I'm taking those ribs to go.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.885
You hungry?

20:18.885 --> 20:20.762
Good boy.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.723
Reacher, what are you doin'?

20:23.723 --> 20:27.852
Owner's been leaving him out,
not giving him water.

20:27.936 --> 20:31.022
What the hell's goin' on here?

20:31.022 --> 20:33.066
This your dog, sir?

20:33.066 --> 20:36.194
It was my uncle's.
He died a few weeks ago.

20:36.194 --> 20:38.363
I didn't want the mutt,
but now I got it.

20:38.363 --> 20:41.115
"It"? What's his name?

20:41.199 --> 20:42.784
It was a barn dog.
Got no name.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.787
Now, I told you the other day
to stay the hell out of my yard.

20:45.787 --> 20:48.373
Negligent care of an animal's
a misdemeanor in Margrave.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.917
$500 fine,
up to ten days in jail.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.835
Everything going on
in this town,

20:52.919 --> 20:54.754
and you're worried about a dog?

20:54.754 --> 20:57.674
This how they policed
up in Boston?

20:59.133 --> 21:02.095
Don't make me come back
and cite you, sir.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.181
Reacher, come on.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.475
Not a single security camera.

21:52.979 --> 21:56.149
Maybe Kliner doesn't want a
record of what's going on here.

21:56.149 --> 21:59.068
Captain Finlay, over here.

22:01.946 --> 22:04.824
Right this way.
Mr. Kliner's expecting you.

22:06.743 --> 22:10.121
That was a hell of a lot
of animal feed back there.

22:10.121 --> 22:13.624
It's the South.
They all have got cows.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.466
I'll do the talking.

22:21.466 --> 22:23.926
Good. I don't like talking.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.350
A family of skilled marksmen.

22:31.434 --> 22:34.187
Uh, just up here, gentlemen.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.652
I'm not sure I can help you.

22:41.736 --> 22:44.030
I wish I could, but all I know
about these killings

22:44.030 --> 22:45.531
is the gossip from the diner,

22:45.615 --> 22:48.284
which we both know is
far from reliable.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.829
Tanner Spivey,
and has himself disappeared,

22:51.913 --> 22:55.708
called your company multiple
times in the last three days.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.919
Pete Jobling, also deceased,

22:57.919 --> 23:00.630
is a former truck driver
for Kliner Industries.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.757
For a company
we contracted with.

23:02.757 --> 23:04.258
Be that as it may,

23:04.342 --> 23:07.970
you paid his legal fees for
a minor traffic violation

23:08.054 --> 23:09.472
that escalated into
disorderly conduct.

23:09.472 --> 23:11.140
We're just looking
for some clarification

23:11.224 --> 23:15.228
as to your relationship with
these men, if you wouldn't mind.

23:15.228 --> 23:18.272
No. Um...

23:18.356 --> 23:20.733
regarding Mr. Jobling,

23:20.817 --> 23:23.611
I ship product
all over the country.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.947
Truck drivers drive too fast.

23:25.947 --> 23:28.741
They get all amped up
on energy drinks.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.993
It behooves me
to keep lawyers on retainer

23:31.077 --> 23:33.454
to get my drivers back on
the road and keep the wheels

23:33.538 --> 23:36.499
of business literally in motion.

23:36.499 --> 23:39.210
And as for Mr. Spivey,
you said he called my company?

23:39.210 --> 23:42.713
We have a general number with
over a dozen departments.

23:42.797 --> 23:46.509
Perhaps Mr. Spivey has a buddy
on the loading docks?

23:46.509 --> 23:49.679
Maybe they were just making
plans to grab a beer after work.

23:49.679 --> 23:54.559
Perhaps. Or perhaps he was
calling for another reason.

23:54.559 --> 23:57.436
I know you're only
doing your job,

23:57.520 --> 23:59.564
and I know you're just trying
to get answers

23:59.564 --> 24:02.441
about your brother's death.

24:02.525 --> 24:04.902
But, if I may speak frankly,

24:04.986 --> 24:07.196
after all I've done
for this town,

24:07.280 --> 24:08.990
after all I've invested into it,

24:08.990 --> 24:11.826
I'm a little insulted
to be under suspicion.

24:11.826 --> 24:13.161
More than a little.

24:13.161 --> 24:16.330
My intention was never
to insult you, Mr. Kliner.

24:16.414 --> 24:18.499
That's okay.

24:21.377 --> 24:24.672
I know you've been under
a lot of stress with

24:24.672 --> 24:26.757
- all that's been happening.
- My intention

24:26.841 --> 24:28.968
is to conduct my investigation
in any manner

24:28.968 --> 24:30.178
I see fit.

24:30.178 --> 24:31.804
And right now,
that means finding out

24:31.888 --> 24:33.806
what you may or may not know.

24:35.141 --> 24:39.312
I know you've had some trouble
settling in here, Captain.

24:39.312 --> 24:42.481
I wonder why that is.

24:42.565 --> 24:45.109
Maybe it's because you're
a Northerner.

24:45.193 --> 24:48.362
Or maybe it's your
fancy education.

24:49.447 --> 24:52.491
Or maybe it's another reason.
Hmm?

24:55.453 --> 24:59.081
Anyway, you haven't exactly
ingratiated yourself

24:59.165 --> 25:03.711
to the good folks of Margrave.

25:03.711 --> 25:05.963
I mean, the people of this town,

25:06.047 --> 25:07.924
the other members of
the police department

25:07.924 --> 25:10.092
want to help you;
they want to work with you.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.719
They've told me so themselves.

25:11.719 --> 25:15.139
We all want justice to be done.

25:15.223 --> 25:18.434
But not if you're
chasing down theories

25:18.434 --> 25:21.395
without any basis in fact.

25:21.479 --> 25:23.689
Some friendly advice?

25:23.773 --> 25:26.400
This evidence trail
you're following?

25:26.484 --> 25:30.279
It's a waste of time
for you and for me.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.617
Leave it.

25:39.664 --> 25:41.749
Horatio Finlay.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.126
Excuse me?

25:45.962 --> 25:47.797
My father's name.

25:47.797 --> 25:50.132
Horatio Finlay.

25:50.216 --> 25:54.178
You might think you're
everybody's daddy in this town,

25:54.262 --> 25:56.931
but you're not mine.

25:56.931 --> 26:00.309
You don't tell me what leads
to chase and how to chase them.

26:00.393 --> 26:04.981
So if I may give you

26:04.981 --> 26:07.733
if you keep talking to the cops
on my force,

26:07.817 --> 26:12.488
hinder this investigation
in any way, I will put

26:12.488 --> 26:14.323
my fucking foot
up your fucking ass

26:14.407 --> 26:17.118
until your heart fucking stops.

26:22.456 --> 26:26.252
I think it's time
for you gentlemen to leave.

26:39.682 --> 26:42.018
You know, cursing is a sign

26:42.018 --> 26:45.104
of weak mind
and weaker character.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.564
Shut up.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.489
"You're not my daddy.

26:55.573 --> 26:58.409
Horatio Finlay's my daddy."

27:01.871 --> 27:03.664
Oh, loosen up.

27:04.915 --> 27:07.293
You did the right thing.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.171
Kliner's a bully.

27:10.171 --> 27:13.341
Bullies need to know
they can be punished, too.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.138
Don't cry,
no matter what.

27:21.932 --> 27:24.310
Don't cry. I don't care how
scared or upset you get,

27:24.310 --> 27:26.604
don't you dare let 'em
see you cry.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.735
Boys...

27:34.236 --> 27:36.906
I'm gonna get right to it.

27:36.906 --> 27:39.325
We just came from the hospital.

27:39.325 --> 27:42.661
Curtis Bishop had his face
bashed in with this.

27:42.745 --> 27:44.830
His cheekbone was fractured.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.999
He had to have surgery, sutures.

27:47.083 --> 27:49.668
This is a very serious crime.

27:49.752 --> 27:52.463
There were bicycle tracks
leaving Curtis's house.

27:52.463 --> 27:54.173
You know where they led?

27:54.173 --> 27:57.385
Right there.
To your bike, Joe.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.847
Joe, did you do this?

28:13.901 --> 28:16.362
"All signs indicate yes."

28:25.913 --> 28:28.582
You're not safe at home anymore.

28:28.666 --> 28:31.127
You need to pack a bag
and bounce around motels

28:31.127 --> 28:33.796
- outside Margrave for a while.
- I'm chief detective.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.589
And Morrison was chief
of police, and his balls

28:35.673 --> 28:37.133
are in his stomach now.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.218
Kliner knows you suspect him.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.970
We don't know who to trust
at the station.

28:40.970 --> 28:43.639
Motels. Cash. Fake names.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.975
Travel light.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.518
You mean live like you?

28:50.521 --> 28:52.606
You get used to it.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.125
He's in the back.

29:11.125 --> 29:13.210
What's he doing,
packing his tweed pajamas?

29:13.294 --> 29:16.464
- Probably.
- Jesus.

29:16.464 --> 29:17.798
I don't know what's
more depressing,

29:17.882 --> 29:19.717
this or Morrison's place.

29:19.717 --> 29:22.428
You said your family used
to be in farming, right?

29:22.428 --> 29:23.721
Yeah.

29:23.721 --> 29:25.306
How many head of cattle
can a moving truck

29:25.306 --> 29:27.016
full of animal feed
take care of?

29:27.016 --> 29:29.185
A lot. Why?

29:29.185 --> 29:31.854
How many head of cattle does
Kliner have on his compound?

29:31.854 --> 29:33.522
I don't know.

29:33.606 --> 29:35.191
Uh, I see 'em when I
drive by his north acreage;

29:35.191 --> 29:36.400
call it a hundred.

29:36.484 --> 29:37.818
Nothing for the size
of the land.

29:37.902 --> 29:40.029
I'm gonna ask you again. Why?

29:40.029 --> 29:41.739
I don't know.

29:41.739 --> 29:43.699
He was getting a ton of feed
delivered today.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.242
Organized operation.

29:45.326 --> 29:46.952
Didn't seem like the first time
they were doing it.

29:47.036 --> 29:49.413
It's not like he's running
a commercial farm.

29:49.497 --> 29:52.041
It's Georgia.
Lot of folks have cows.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.251
That's what I hear.

29:54.335 --> 29:57.296
Hey. You been here a year?

29:57.296 --> 29:59.381
Who's your decorator, this guy?

30:01.383 --> 30:03.344
Haven't had time to
furniture shop.

30:03.344 --> 30:05.471
- We good to go?
- Yeah.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.389
There's a motel right outside
Hickory where

30:07.473 --> 30:10.684
we can stay under the radar;
third exit off 85.

30:10.768 --> 30:12.770
Reacher.

30:12.770 --> 30:15.105
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page

30:15.189 --> 30:18.317
because your punch-to-syllable
ratio is about 1:1.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.818
I'm gonna go get a snack.

30:19.902 --> 30:21.320
Just because
it looks like Kliner

30:21.320 --> 30:23.739
might be a part of all this
does not mean you can just

30:23.739 --> 30:24.823
go take him out.

30:24.907 --> 30:26.242
No problem.

30:26.242 --> 30:27.952
- Really?
- A federal agent,

30:27.952 --> 30:30.287
a cop and multiple
civilians are dead.

30:30.371 --> 30:31.664
We're not dealing with
a small-scale operation,

30:31.664 --> 30:32.998
this thing's a hydra;

30:33.082 --> 30:35.042
I cut off one head,
two more grow in its place.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.253
There's no justice
for Joe in that.

30:37.253 --> 30:39.296
I'm gonna uncover
this whole operation,

30:39.380 --> 30:41.131
and then burn it to the ground.

30:41.215 --> 30:42.383
That takes time,
which is something

30:42.383 --> 30:44.468
I have in great quantity.

30:44.552 --> 30:47.930
Taking Kliner out's
the last move, not the first.

30:47.930 --> 30:49.598
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

30:49.682 --> 30:50.766
Pretend whatever you want.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.017
Okay.

30:52.101 --> 30:54.228
So, we have three

30:54.228 --> 30:56.355
Hubble, Jobling and Spivey.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.732
Spivey's in the wind, Hubble's
wife doesn't know anything.

30:58.816 --> 31:00.359
But maybe Jobling's wife does.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.987
It's late, but I can
question her tomorrow.

31:02.987 --> 31:05.155
Do whatever you want,
but Spivey's the answer.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.032
I get him to rat on whoever
paid him to kill Hubble,

31:07.116 --> 31:09.118
we know everything.
I'm finding him.

31:09.118 --> 31:10.286
Now?

31:10.286 --> 31:11.453
He could've told me to
meet him anywhere.

31:11.537 --> 31:12.746
He picked the Blue Cat.

31:12.830 --> 31:13.872
A place he was comfortable,

31:13.956 --> 31:15.624
was probably a regular.

31:15.708 --> 31:18.043
Maybe some of the other regulars
know where he's hiding.

31:18.127 --> 31:20.588
And neither of you
are coming with me.

31:20.588 --> 31:22.965
You'll be made instantly.
You both reek of cop.

31:22.965 --> 31:24.216
I'll meet you in Hickory.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.260
All right,
I'll meet you there, too.

31:26.260 --> 31:28.846
I gotta go get some toothpaste
and deodorant and stuff.

31:28.846 --> 31:31.223
I don't know how
he lives like this.

31:31.307 --> 31:34.184
Yeah, I gotta
make a stop, too. Roscoe?

31:36.979 --> 31:38.147
Be safe.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.774
Oh, watch out.
Keep bein' nice like that

31:40.858 --> 31:43.694
and you're gonna be making
friends around here in no time.

31:55.331 --> 31:56.874
Get off my truck.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.794
You been with that Reacher guy
a lot lately.

32:00.878 --> 32:03.172
Did he tell you
all about himself?

32:03.172 --> 32:06.133
Or is there not much talking
going on?

32:06.133 --> 32:09.219
Your mama teach you the way to
a girl's heart is stalking her?

32:09.303 --> 32:10.971
I wouldn't have to
resort to this

32:11.055 --> 32:12.473
if you would ever
go out with me.

32:12.473 --> 32:15.267
But some outlier strolls in,

32:15.351 --> 32:18.062
next thing I hear,
you guys are best pals.

32:18.062 --> 32:20.981
Five years ago the Kliners
were outliers. Now move.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.525
If you guys are so close,
he must've told you

32:23.609 --> 32:24.985
about Baghdad, right?

32:25.069 --> 32:26.862
'Bout those civilians
that he killed.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.948
And how his connections
got him off?

32:30.032 --> 32:31.450
The charges disappeared,

32:31.450 --> 32:34.036
but nothing goes away
completely, not these days.

32:34.036 --> 32:36.580
Jack Reacher's a murderer.

32:38.415 --> 32:40.125
If you don't let me
into my truck right now,

32:40.209 --> 32:42.586
I'm gonna have you facedown
on the hood in handcuffs.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.548
Maybe I'd like that.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.771
Hey.

33:00.771 --> 33:04.316
I'm looking out for you, Roscoe.
I care about you.

33:20.874 --> 33:24.002
<i>♪ Baby's into runnin' around...</i>

33:25.963 --> 33:27.631
Whoa.

33:29.091 --> 33:30.509
Pull!

33:31.802 --> 33:34.179
Yow! There she is.

33:34.263 --> 33:36.181
Nice shot.

33:36.265 --> 33:39.184
Damn right. I'm bustin' up more
clay than a Tuscan earthquake.

33:39.268 --> 33:42.521
- I'm Steve Williams.
- Oh.

33:42.521 --> 33:45.149
And I gotta tell you,
you guys put on a better party

33:45.149 --> 33:46.567
than the Charleston branch.

33:46.567 --> 33:48.026
Debbie Shane.

33:48.110 --> 33:49.945
- You're from Charleston?
- Mm-hmm.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.072
How's that son of a gun
Tom Sloane doin'?

33:52.156 --> 33:54.491
Still a son of a gun,
in every way possible.

33:54.575 --> 33:55.784
Yeah,

33:55.868 --> 33:57.911
that doesn't surprise me. Pull!

34:00.539 --> 34:02.249
That is how you do it.

34:02.249 --> 34:04.293
Remind me to never get
on your bad side.

34:04.293 --> 34:07.588
So, what're you
doing in Atlanta, Steve?

34:07.588 --> 34:09.465
Uh, grandmother passed.

34:09.465 --> 34:10.883
Oh.

34:10.883 --> 34:12.426
In between wakes I still need
to get some work done,

34:12.426 --> 34:14.386
so I was gonna use your office;
but when I called...

34:14.470 --> 34:16.346
- Excuse me, sir, care for a drink?
- ...they said you closed shop

34:16.430 --> 34:18.974
- early for this event, so here I am.
- Pull!

34:20.350 --> 34:22.060
I'm sorry about your grandma,

34:22.144 --> 34:23.812
but you know what helps
clear your head?

34:23.896 --> 34:25.105
- Shooting things.
- Ah.

34:25.189 --> 34:27.149
Guns make me nervous.

34:27.149 --> 34:29.443
But you know what
you could do for me?

34:29.443 --> 34:32.321
Is tell me a bit about Axis
in Atlanta.

34:32.321 --> 34:34.656
Past few days has me thinking
how life's short,

34:34.740 --> 34:38.744
maybe it's time I shake things
up a bit, transfer offices.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.037
Well, it's a great
place to work.

34:40.037 --> 34:42.623
Nice people.
What division are you in?

34:42.623 --> 34:43.957
Account services.

34:44.041 --> 34:45.959
But truth be told,
I started out wanting to work

34:46.043 --> 34:47.294
in currency management.

34:47.294 --> 34:48.921
Was hoping to make a run
at that again.

34:48.921 --> 34:51.507
Well, that's gonna be tough
to do at our branch, Stevie.

34:51.507 --> 34:53.008
We had a guy
handling that for us,

34:53.008 --> 34:54.802
but he picked up and left
about a year ago

34:54.802 --> 34:57.346
and we discontinued
the department.

34:57.346 --> 34:58.430
It's kind of niche, you know?

34:58.514 --> 34:59.973
Not that many people do it so...

35:00.057 --> 35:01.558
I'm confused.

35:01.642 --> 35:04.186
Your currency manager, what
did you say his name was again?

35:04.186 --> 35:07.773
I didn't.
But it was Paul Hubble.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.692
So this Hubble guy quit
the bank a year ago?

35:10.776 --> 35:13.529
Yep. Up and left without so much
as two weeks' notice.

35:13.529 --> 35:16.073
Kind of a dick move
if you ask me.

35:16.073 --> 35:19.451
Bottom line, we don't really
do the currency thing anymore.

35:19.535 --> 35:21.161
Pull!

35:25.874 --> 35:27.876
Be careful.

35:27.960 --> 35:31.338
A wedding ring falls on the
ground, it's up for grabs.

35:31.338 --> 35:32.673
Really? Says who?

35:32.673 --> 35:34.216
The law.

35:34.216 --> 35:35.634
Famous case of
<i>Finders v. Keepers.</i>

35:35.634 --> 35:37.970
Never heard of it?

35:37.970 --> 35:40.013
No, ma'am, I haven't.

35:40.097 --> 35:42.891
You're not from around here.

35:42.975 --> 35:46.937
That "ma'am" sounds way north
of the Mason-Dixon.

35:46.937 --> 35:48.605
Boston.

35:48.689 --> 35:51.024
Oh, no.

35:51.108 --> 35:52.734
Well, I'll stay

35:52.818 --> 35:54.528
if you promise not to bring up
the Patriots.

35:54.528 --> 35:57.948
Still don't know how the Falcons
blew that Super Bowl.

35:57.948 --> 35:59.616
At 28-20,
you kick the field goal.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.869
I said don't bring it up.

36:01.869 --> 36:04.288
Okay. My bad.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.461
So, what do you do?

36:11.545 --> 36:14.506
Uh, nothing important.

36:14.590 --> 36:16.758
Not recently, anyway.

36:16.842 --> 36:21.346
Cryptic. Cryptic is good.

36:21.430 --> 36:25.142
Sorry. I work in
law enforcement.

36:25.142 --> 36:30.230
Wow. And that
brought you... here?

36:30.314 --> 36:34.651
I'm on a case I can't
seem to untangle.

36:34.735 --> 36:36.486
With a rookie I can trust,

36:36.570 --> 36:38.989
and a veteran
who I'm not sure I can.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.199
At least not to do
the smart thing.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.243
What's your gut say?

36:43.327 --> 36:45.412
Get the hell out of Dodge.

36:45.412 --> 36:48.248
So why are you staying?

36:51.752 --> 36:54.838
Because we're the only ones
who want to make things right.

36:54.922 --> 36:57.215
Seems like a good reason.

37:01.678 --> 37:04.431
Are my questions bothering you?

37:06.141 --> 37:11.063
No. I'm just, uh,
not great at conversation.

37:11.063 --> 37:13.899
But here goes.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.318
Where are you from?

37:16.318 --> 37:20.072
I'm from Marietta,
work in cosmetics,

37:20.072 --> 37:24.368
and my instincts are impeccable.

37:24.368 --> 37:27.788
And my instincts tell me
you're a nice guy.

37:27.788 --> 37:30.415
So why don't we find
another bar around here?

37:30.499 --> 37:34.002
One with pool tables
and cheaper drinks.

37:34.086 --> 37:36.171
Maybe even a dark corner
somewhere

37:36.171 --> 37:37.839
and see where the night
takes us?

37:40.300 --> 37:43.136
I'm married, remember?

37:44.429 --> 37:45.639
Me, too.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.557
But when a fella's marriage
is going well,

37:47.641 --> 37:50.936
he doesn't take his ring off for
the world to see in a motel bar.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.815
I'm flattered.

37:54.815 --> 37:57.734
And you're nice, too.

37:57.818 --> 37:59.695
And lovely.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.365
But I'm not your guy.

38:07.494 --> 38:10.622
Okay.

38:10.706 --> 38:13.208
Can't blame a girl for trying.

38:15.711 --> 38:18.380
Good luck, Officer.
