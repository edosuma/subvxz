WEBVTT

00:02.250 --> 00:03.360
<i>Zod's plan is to conquer</i>

00:03.540 --> 00:04.620
<i>the entire universe,</i>

00:04.790 --> 00:07.250
colonize other planets,
rule over their people.

00:07.420 --> 00:08.580
We already have a plan.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.910
<i>Wegthor,
home of our resistance.</i>

00:11.380 --> 00:15.090
- <i>If Brainiac escaped--</i>
- <i>Then maybe Seg did, too.</i>

00:19.220 --> 00:20.510
You killed Brainiac?

00:20.720 --> 00:23.840
All my life, all you
have done is made me afraid.

00:28.190 --> 00:30.980
<i>Jayna, Vidar, you will
follow in the footsteps</i>

00:31.150 --> 00:33.110
<i>of those who have
come before you,</i>

00:33.280 --> 00:35.440
<i>or you will die trying.</i>

00:35.610 --> 00:38.320
Don't leave me here!
Jayna!

00:38.950 --> 00:40.780
Jayna, Jayna.

00:42.330 --> 00:43.190
<i>How long do
we wait for Nyssa?</i>

00:43.370 --> 00:45.780
We don't. She's either
captured or dead, Val.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.920
It is time for
this resistance to end,

00:48.090 --> 00:49.870
and I need you to
convince him of this.

00:50.460 --> 00:51.540
And if I refuse?

00:51.710 --> 00:54.300
I will raise young
Cor-Vex myself.

00:54.470 --> 00:55.710
No, no!

00:56.090 --> 00:57.330
<i>Shithead detected.</i>

00:57.590 --> 01:00.590
You two little candy asses
ain't felt nothing yet.

01:03.390 --> 01:04.550
It's been six months,
and we are still

01:04.730 --> 01:06.310
no closer to locating Doomsday.

01:12.480 --> 01:13.350
<i>Where are we looking?</i>

01:13.530 --> 01:15.860
Sensors picked up something
around Sector 2--

01:16.070 --> 01:16.940
probably nothing.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.490
<i>Let's get in closer.</i>

01:27.870 --> 01:29.910
Hold on, I think
I have something.

01:32.340 --> 01:34.250
Where'd it go?
Did we lose it?

01:35.340 --> 01:36.670
<i>I can't see it on the ra--</i>

02:21.890 --> 02:24.380
- It's Val-El.
- That's Jax-Ur.

02:24.560 --> 02:27.770
- Sir, thank you.
- Thank you, commander.

02:28.310 --> 02:29.430
It's Jax-Ur.

02:32.940 --> 02:34.480
Sir, thank you.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.110
Good to see you.

03:10.100 --> 03:13.560
That bastard down there has
stolen our better tomorrow.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.770
We're stealing it back!

04:25.550 --> 04:27.510
Adam. Adam.

04:28.220 --> 04:29.380
Adam.

04:29.890 --> 04:30.970
Adam!

04:31.350 --> 04:33.930
Wouldn't bother trying
to get out of those chains.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.480
Never going to happen.

04:38.230 --> 04:40.270
This one?
Nah, you're right.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.930
Not disco enough for
a big boy like you, is it?

04:44.530 --> 04:46.020
Ah...

04:48.740 --> 04:49.730
This one.

04:54.540 --> 04:56.830
Oh, he's awake.

04:57.250 --> 04:58.160
Shh.

05:02.550 --> 05:04.080
He's having
one of those happy dreams.

05:05.630 --> 05:07.970
Wakey, wakey,
hands off snakey.

05:13.890 --> 05:16.760
Mmm, mmm, mmm,
ain't you a little cutie?

05:16.980 --> 05:19.850
Oh, well, thank you.
I like to think so myself.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.100
What's this?

05:22.030 --> 05:22.940
- That's my--
- Don't care.

05:25.070 --> 05:27.900
Right, what do you
say there, numbnuts?

05:28.450 --> 05:29.650
Ready for some fun?

05:29.830 --> 05:32.280
I think we should
define fun first.

05:33.040 --> 05:36.750
Uh, and also, my name
is Seg-El, not "numbnuts."

05:37.670 --> 05:38.620
Anything you say, Seagull.

05:38.790 --> 05:40.660
So I was thinking
of getting my machete

05:40.840 --> 05:42.700
and cutting
a teeny, tiny little hole

05:42.880 --> 05:45.500
right there next to your teeny,
tiny little belly button.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.340
And then I was
going to rip out

05:47.510 --> 05:48.970
those pesky intestines
of yours,

05:49.090 --> 05:50.930
'cause, I mean,
who needs them?

05:51.140 --> 05:53.340
Uh, yeah, no, yeah,
I need them.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.260
Listen, uh, I don't know
who you are--

05:56.430 --> 05:59.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's a joke, right?

06:10.660 --> 06:13.120
He's a funny guy, right?
He's a funny guy.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.620
Yeah, he is.

06:15.790 --> 06:17.870
Doesn't know who I am.
That's good, I like it.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.500
Almost had me going there
for a second.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.250
No, I'm being serious.
I don't know who you are.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.290
You're in the presence
of The Main Man.

06:32.970 --> 06:35.840
The Main Man?
Really?

06:36.220 --> 06:37.510
Come on!

06:38.980 --> 06:42.600
Assassin to Royalty?
Scourge Of The Cosmos?

06:43.690 --> 06:46.430
The Last Czarnian?
Ultimate Bastich?

06:46.610 --> 06:48.900
Machete Man, Mister Machete,
Master Machete?

06:49.070 --> 06:50.440
Mister Frag, Master Frag?

06:51.240 --> 06:52.650
Archbishop of the
First Celestial Church

06:52.820 --> 06:53.690
of the Triple Fish-God?

06:53.870 --> 06:55.610
None of this is ringing a bell?

06:56.580 --> 06:58.570
Son of a bastich!

07:03.920 --> 07:05.880
Everyone knows who I am.

07:08.300 --> 07:11.040
Wow, okay.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.970
The name's Lobo.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.710
Thank you!

07:19.180 --> 07:20.970
So you have heard
of me, yeah?

07:21.140 --> 07:23.760
So then you'll know what
my name means, yes?

07:24.520 --> 07:25.510
No?

07:25.690 --> 07:29.600
It means "he who devours
his enemies' entrails

07:29.780 --> 07:31.390
and enjoys it."

07:40.790 --> 07:42.750
I'm just jerkin'
your gherkin, man.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.080
I have no idea what it means.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.620
I killed my parents before
they could tell me, so...

07:47.750 --> 07:50.210
Listen, uh, Lobo.

07:50.380 --> 07:52.340
Uh, we don't want
to waste your time.

07:52.510 --> 07:54.920
So I got to tell you,
I think you got the wrong guys.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.210
I know I've got
the wrong fraggin' guys!

07:59.310 --> 08:00.170
I know.

08:00.850 --> 08:04.220
It's why I'm going to use
your intestines

08:04.350 --> 08:08.640
to strangle
this saucy little minx.

08:08.820 --> 08:11.100
And then I'm going to
crack open his head

08:11.530 --> 08:15.190
and drop a big old dirty deuce
inside his skull.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.230
I'm sorry. I'm having
a really hard time here

08:17.410 --> 08:18.570
understanding
how those connect.

08:18.740 --> 08:20.980
Oh, just the sheer
fraggin' spectacle of it

08:21.160 --> 08:23.320
ought to loosen up
old Seagull's tongue over there

08:23.500 --> 08:27.410
so he can tell me where the
frag the Green Gooch is!

08:27.840 --> 08:30.120
Wait! Wait.
Let me say just one thing.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.750
Is it good-bye?
Better make it good-bye.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.409
It'd make more sense
if it was good-bye.

08:34.590 --> 08:36.049
How about Brainiac?

08:36.179 --> 08:37.460
That's who you're
looking for, right?

08:37.640 --> 08:41.470
The Green Gooch?
It's Brainiac.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.470
You know, I've been
spending a long time

08:43.730 --> 08:45.590
looking for that a-hole.

08:46.650 --> 08:48.430
And then something activates

08:48.610 --> 08:51.310
the shithead scanner
I left here,

08:51.530 --> 08:53.020
and when I arrive,
what do I find?

08:53.240 --> 08:54.770
You two ass-smears
and no Brainiac.

08:54.950 --> 08:57.440
- Now, why is that?
- Because he's dead.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.610
- I killed him.
- You?

09:02.620 --> 09:05.740
With your long eyelashes
and your beautiful, soft skin

09:05.920 --> 09:08.910
and that beautiful smell--
you smell like a meadow, nah.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.830
It's a true story.
He really did.

09:11.000 --> 09:11.870
H can vouch for him.

09:13.130 --> 09:15.000
I can take you
to the body if you want.

09:15.590 --> 09:18.130
Counter proposal--
you tell me where his body is,

09:18.300 --> 09:20.920
or I paint the forest floor
with your medulla oblongata.

09:21.100 --> 09:23.710
No, no, no, no, no.
That's not going to happen.

09:23.890 --> 09:26.220
See, we're going
to take you to the body,

09:26.390 --> 09:27.760
you're going to let us go,

09:27.940 --> 09:31.230
and nothing is going
to get painted.

09:31.730 --> 09:33.770
Huh?
Sound like a deal?

09:36.320 --> 09:38.150
Fine!
Have it your way.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.410
But fair fraggin' warning.

09:41.830 --> 09:43.240
If there is no body
when I arrive,

09:43.410 --> 09:45.900
best believe there will
be two when I leave...

09:46.080 --> 09:48.660
as in you and pretty pants
over there.

09:48.830 --> 09:51.170
- Oh, that sounds fair.
- Watch your eyes.

09:55.260 --> 09:56.210
<i>Report just in--</i>

09:56.380 --> 09:58.540
<i>Doomsday took out two of our
skimmers in the Outlands.</i>

09:58.720 --> 09:59.750
Both pilots were killed.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.790
Comm chatter suggests
they engaged first.

10:01.970 --> 10:03.260
Well, we knew capture
would be a challenge.

10:03.430 --> 10:05.010
- But at least we have a--
- A challenge?

10:05.180 --> 10:07.090
They didn't stand a chance,
and neither pilot knew

10:07.270 --> 10:08.980
they were signing up
for a suicide mission.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.480
They were Sagitari.

10:10.650 --> 10:12.390
Like you and I,
they knew the risk.

10:12.940 --> 10:13.810
Speak your mind.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.220
Doomsday aside,

10:15.400 --> 10:18.440
our casualties on Wegthor
are absolutely unacceptable.

10:18.610 --> 10:21.280
And it's because they are not
Sagitari like you and I,

10:21.490 --> 10:22.610
not even close.

10:22.740 --> 10:24.450
They are
ex-Rankless conscripts,

10:24.580 --> 10:26.070
and slapping a uniform on them

10:26.250 --> 10:27.990
and handing them a blaster
doesn't change that.

10:29.870 --> 10:31.830
- What do you propose?
- Send me up there.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.410
Let me assess their abilities,

10:33.590 --> 10:36.450
better integrate them
with more seasoned Sagitari.

10:36.630 --> 10:37.960
Give me a chance.

10:38.550 --> 10:42.090
I can get them into shape, and
we can finally end this war.

10:43.430 --> 10:44.920
You're right.

10:45.350 --> 10:47.720
For many of them,
basic training was rushed...

10:47.890 --> 10:49.380
by necessity.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.180
That needs to change.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.010
And I agree, you would make
an excellent instructor...

10:54.520 --> 10:55.980
but here, in Kandor.

10:57.610 --> 10:59.480
No, no that's not
what I'm saying.

10:59.650 --> 11:02.240
I know what you're saying,
and this is me saying no.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.610
Yes, General.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.120
Lyta.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.290
I can't have anything
happen to you up there.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.450
I need you close.

11:16.670 --> 11:19.540
Besides, with the plan
we've put in motion,

11:19.720 --> 11:22.130
<i>the battle for Wegthor
will soon be over,</i>

11:22.300 --> 11:25.040
<i>and the Resistance
will be shattered.</i>

12:12.770 --> 12:14.310
So you can breathe
on the surface.

12:15.020 --> 12:16.680
You've got a long hike
ahead of you.

12:18.190 --> 12:19.060
The Rebels are that way.

12:21.030 --> 12:22.810
Oh, I'm sorry, did I stutter?

12:23.280 --> 12:24.440
Move!

12:49.260 --> 12:50.970
And not a word of a lie--

12:51.100 --> 12:53.390
that mother-fragger
gets my entire city

12:53.600 --> 12:55.090
and puts it inside
a fraggin' bottle!

12:55.650 --> 12:57.510
- A bottle.
- Yeah, Brainiac will do that.

12:57.690 --> 12:59.810
I ain't finished.
I ain't finished.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.560
So what happens next?

13:01.780 --> 13:03.190
Oh, well, that's a great
question--thank you for asking.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.810
After that,
the moldy douche-baguette

13:05.030 --> 13:07.110
proceeds to destroy
my entire fraggin' planet,

13:07.240 --> 13:08.480
and then--
get a load of this--

13:08.700 --> 13:10.660
then pisses off in his massive,

13:10.870 --> 13:13.910
clearly "overcompensating
for something" ship.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.280
Wait, Brainiac killed
your entire race?

13:16.460 --> 13:18.370
Exactly.
Well, ye--no.

13:18.540 --> 13:20.160
Truth be told,
they were already dead.

13:20.340 --> 13:22.580
I kind of created a swarm
of scorpion-rattlers

13:22.760 --> 13:23.960
- to kill them all.
- Mm-hmm.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.880
You know what the worst
thing is, though?

13:26.050 --> 13:27.790
I'd just gotten the joint just
the way I like it, you know?

13:27.930 --> 13:30.390
Head off planet for a
little assassination vacation,

13:30.560 --> 13:33.970
only to return home to find
that there is no home.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.970
My home, gone.

13:36.140 --> 13:37.310
You know,
I can relate with that.

13:37.520 --> 13:38.930
- Yeah, you can?
- Yeah.

13:39.060 --> 13:40.850
- When I got back, same thing--
- Don't care.

13:41.020 --> 13:41.890
Probably not
much further now.

13:42.110 --> 13:43.560
It's about 7.29 minutes.

13:43.780 --> 13:45.610
Hey, and once we get to him,
we say our good-byes.

13:45.780 --> 13:47.060
- Right, that's the deal.
- That's the deal.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.400
The Main Man
always keeps his word.

13:48.570 --> 13:49.690
Right, we get back
to Krypton.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.450
Oh, did you
just say Craptown?

13:53.040 --> 13:54.490
- No, I said--
- Craptown!

13:57.120 --> 13:59.960
You make me laugh, man.
He's from Craptown!

14:00.130 --> 14:02.910
Hey, you're funny, man.

14:03.090 --> 14:06.000
Craptown--sounds like
a musical with puppets.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.840
"Oh, hello, my name's Seagull,

14:08.010 --> 14:09.220
and I'm the mayor of Craptown."

14:09.390 --> 14:11.300
"Hello, Seagull."

14:11.430 --> 14:15.390
I'd watch the shit
out of Craptown.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.680
Wait.

14:19.810 --> 14:21.100
What's the rush?

14:21.480 --> 14:22.890
What's so special
about Craptown?

14:23.610 --> 14:25.820
Well, for a start,

14:26.030 --> 14:29.320
it's 19.138 million
light-years from here.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.900
Oddly specific...

14:34.240 --> 14:35.320
but okay.

14:36.700 --> 14:38.190
How did you know that?

14:41.040 --> 14:42.000
I don't know.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.130
Remember the story
Father used to tell us?

14:53.300 --> 14:55.140
He told us a lot of stories.

14:55.310 --> 14:59.640
- The one about the fire bird.
- Flamebird.

14:59.770 --> 15:01.100
That's the one.

15:01.270 --> 15:04.010
It was
a Raoist creation story.

15:05.690 --> 15:09.650
Rao was father
to all the gods,

15:09.780 --> 15:15.400
but Flamebird and her brother,
Vohc, were his first.

15:15.580 --> 15:18.990
Vohc was charged
with building the world

15:19.120 --> 15:23.160
and Flamebird
with burning it all down.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.420
Can you remember why?

15:26.590 --> 15:28.330
It was all about rebirth.

15:28.550 --> 15:32.380
The cycle
would constantly repeat.

15:33.010 --> 15:36.420
The world would be cleansed
through Flamebird's fire,

15:36.600 --> 15:39.560
then replenished
once Vohc rebuilt it.

15:40.850 --> 15:43.810
With each cycle,
Vohc was inspired

15:43.980 --> 15:47.890
to reimagine his work,
striving for perfection,

15:48.070 --> 15:49.730
until, finally...

15:52.320 --> 15:55.780
they created the planet Krypton
we know today.

16:06.880 --> 16:10.920
And that is why you never
mistake passion

16:11.090 --> 16:12.750
for strength.

16:14.220 --> 16:15.710
Who's next?

16:17.930 --> 16:20.890
Come on, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

16:22.270 --> 16:26.930
This is how we build Sagitari--

16:27.150 --> 16:29.890
practice, regimen,

16:30.070 --> 16:32.680
discipline, training.

16:32.860 --> 16:36.650
One session,
one movement at a time.

16:37.070 --> 16:39.530
We build our skills.

16:39.700 --> 16:42.360
We build our resolve.

16:51.170 --> 16:53.290
- You.
- Me?

16:53.470 --> 16:56.330
Do I have to come
and drag you down myself?

17:05.599 --> 17:07.970
Hand-to-hand
or a weapon of your choice.

17:11.480 --> 17:12.720
Never hesitate.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.560
It gives your opponent
the advantage.

17:14.740 --> 17:15.400
Get up.

17:33.210 --> 17:34.380
Is that all you've got?

17:48.650 --> 17:50.980
- Ask for mercy!
- No.

17:51.190 --> 17:53.060
Ask for mercy!

17:54.030 --> 17:55.980
Yes, mercy!

18:03.740 --> 18:05.080
Well, Seagull,
I take it all back.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.330
Looks like Brainiac was
shit-panned and mined for gold.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.290
Just got to
double-check, see?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.040
Piss off.

18:32.270 --> 18:34.980
Is it--maybe check it again.

18:35.570 --> 18:37.730
Yeah, check--check it again.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.190
He's not going
to find Brainiac.

18:43.370 --> 18:44.070
What?

18:44.240 --> 18:45.070
He's not going
to find Brainiac.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.610
- Why? Where is he?
- Here's my problem, boys.

18:48.790 --> 18:52.120
The sensor isn't registering
any Brainiac.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.450
But the scanner...

18:54.880 --> 18:59.840
the shithead scanner told me
that he is on this planet.

19:00.010 --> 19:03.800
So, once more,
with a cherry on top,

19:04.100 --> 19:07.380
where the frag is he?

19:09.890 --> 19:12.980
- Um, I think he knows.
- Wow.

19:13.150 --> 19:14.930
Let me try and explain
something to you ladies.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.770
You see, you didn't keep
your part of the bargain,

19:16.980 --> 19:19.230
which means that I have
to gut one of you

19:19.450 --> 19:21.780
while the other tries
really hard

19:22.240 --> 19:24.360
to answer my first question.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.870
The second question being...

19:27.040 --> 19:30.830
whose insides will become
their outsides first?

19:31.040 --> 19:32.200
- Whoa, whoa, hey!
- You?

19:32.380 --> 19:34.120
- Hey, unsubscribe!
- Don't do this.

19:34.290 --> 19:37.040
- We don't have to do this--
- Shut up!

19:37.250 --> 19:40.750
I told you,
I'm a man of my word.

19:45.850 --> 19:46.680
Huh?

19:50.390 --> 19:52.260
Well, well, well...

19:55.150 --> 19:57.100
How about that
for a fraggin' twist?

19:57.270 --> 19:59.860
It looks like Brainiac...

20:00.030 --> 20:02.820
is in you.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.370
We have the advantage
in the tunnels,

20:10.580 --> 20:12.490
but we're no match topside.

20:12.670 --> 20:13.910
We need to
draw them underground,

20:14.630 --> 20:15.710
make them fight on our terms.

20:15.880 --> 20:19.460
Agreed, but our men need
food, rest, medical attention.

20:20.210 --> 20:21.920
- Nyssa?
- Nyssa!

20:22.930 --> 20:24.710
It's okay, it's okay.
She's with us.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.970
Oh. Oh.

20:27.430 --> 20:28.840
We thought we'd never
see you again.

20:30.470 --> 20:31.380
What's happened to you?

20:31.560 --> 20:33.550
You look a sight.
Are you all right?

20:37.230 --> 20:39.890
Dru-Zod sent me up here
to be his eyes and ears.

20:43.030 --> 20:46.270
- Tell us what you mean.
- He has Cor-Vex.

20:46.450 --> 20:49.610
- She's Zod's spy.
- He took my baby.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.410
I need your help
to get him back.

20:54.540 --> 20:55.750
Please.

20:59.630 --> 21:01.710
I know
you may not believe me,

21:01.960 --> 21:03.960
but Zod gave me no choice.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.720
I would never betray you.

21:08.550 --> 21:12.050
There's
some information that I have.

21:12.270 --> 21:14.100
I think it could help
the cause.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.520
Well, all right.
Tell us what it is.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.310
Sensors on Krypton show

21:22.490 --> 21:24.900
that there's going to be
a solar flare today.

21:24.990 --> 21:27.950
Its radiation will temporarily
disable all communication

21:28.120 --> 21:29.730
for about two hours.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.730
Zod has been using
these flares as windows

21:32.950 --> 21:34.910
to bring in more supplies.

21:35.290 --> 21:37.750
He is planning on moving them
across the southern perimeter.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.790
And how did you come about
this information?

21:41.500 --> 21:43.790
A Sagitari in Kandor...

21:44.630 --> 21:46.750
still loyal to my father...

21:47.010 --> 21:48.550
even after his death.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.880
Daron is dead?
What happened?

21:55.480 --> 21:58.140
Executed in cold blood
by Lyta-Zod.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.140
You were right.
It was a trap.

22:02.980 --> 22:04.390
That's how they got me.

22:06.110 --> 22:09.650
They used my father as bait.

22:10.030 --> 22:11.690
Nyssa, I'm sorry.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.490
I know your relationship
with Daron was...

22:17.000 --> 22:18.660
complicated, but...

22:19.460 --> 22:21.370
I doubt
it makes it any easier.

22:22.380 --> 22:24.590
If this information about
the solar flare is true,

22:24.760 --> 22:26.500
it could be very useful to us.

22:28.880 --> 22:29.840
I'll look into it.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.140
Don't let her
out of your sight.

22:47.490 --> 22:49.150
You know what
surprises me, Seagull?

22:49.660 --> 22:52.740
That Brainiac chose you
for a campground.

22:52.950 --> 22:54.860
Honestly, I would have bet
on the hot blonde.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.530
We don't have
to do this, Lobo.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.490
We could just
talk this out, calmly.

22:58.660 --> 23:00.950
Nope, <i>nada,</i> no can do,
decision made.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.990
I am going to stomp
the Green Gooch

23:03.170 --> 23:05.080
right the frag out of you.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.170
I don't think
you want to do that.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.120
You thought wrong, Seagull.

23:16.430 --> 23:18.220
Whoo!
Two for two.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.470
How'd you do that?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.850
<i>Uh, I think
I have telekinetic powers!</i>

23:22.100 --> 23:23.270
Oh, little loud--

23:24.520 --> 23:25.930
Your mouth didn't move.

23:26.110 --> 23:28.020
<i>Holy shit.
I have telepathy, too?</i>

23:32.030 --> 23:34.400
- Ah!
- Really?

23:37.370 --> 23:38.030
Hey!

23:42.710 --> 23:43.790
Is that it?

23:51.510 --> 23:52.750
Not even close.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.940
Brainiac, if you're in there,

24:06.400 --> 24:09.390
I've come here to find you
and put you in a world of hurt.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.740
Damn, Seagull.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.240
I was going
to kill you last.

24:21.160 --> 24:21.900
Oh, well.

24:43.390 --> 24:45.810
You're my little pony now.

24:58.950 --> 25:00.610
It looks as though
your intel was right.

25:01.580 --> 25:02.940
The Sagitari supply line--

25:03.160 --> 25:05.700
food, oxygenators,
medical supplies--

25:05.920 --> 25:07.750
originates from the Elevator

25:07.880 --> 25:10.830
and cuts a large southerly loop
to drop-off points throughout.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.540
So we'll divert
a faction to the south

25:13.720 --> 25:16.460
and target the weakest part
of their supply chain.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.800
If this works, it will be
a much-needed victory.

25:19.010 --> 25:21.760
Glad to hear it.
And it will work.

25:22.180 --> 25:23.590
We'll know soon enough.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.350
- I'm sorry about all this.
- No need.

25:28.980 --> 25:30.440
I would have done
the same thing.

25:31.070 --> 25:32.350
It's war.

25:35.030 --> 25:36.020
It is.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.400
Since I last saw you,

25:41.490 --> 25:44.360
everything has
turned upside down.

25:46.290 --> 25:49.530
With my father, with Cor-Vex--

25:49.750 --> 25:51.960
Just try to stay strong.
We will get your son back.

25:53.550 --> 25:57.420
Did you find
what you were looking for?

25:58.390 --> 25:59.220
In Bokos?

26:02.850 --> 26:03.800
No.

26:05.430 --> 26:06.470
And now I never will.

26:06.770 --> 26:08.130
That's Daron.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.560
Even in death,
he still manages to disappoint.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.680
You must be tired
after your journey.

26:15.900 --> 26:17.940
Rest, eat.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.070
If you need anything, just ask.

26:28.580 --> 26:29.450
Whoo!

26:29.630 --> 26:32.080
Come on, Brainiac, show me
that little ugly mug of yours,

26:32.340 --> 26:34.000
or I am going to
cut open your new home

26:34.170 --> 26:36.830
from tip to taint
and drag you out myself.

26:39.510 --> 26:40.470
No?

26:41.680 --> 26:44.550
Have it your way.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.300
Ouch.

27:00.570 --> 27:04.030
Oh, God, I think I got some
Lobo juice in my mouth.

27:04.870 --> 27:06.450
You're welcome.

27:09.250 --> 27:11.710
That's gross.
Why is he doing that?

27:11.880 --> 27:13.620
Oh, yeah, that.

27:13.710 --> 27:15.750
He's got this
healing-factor thingy.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.170
He'll be
brand-spanking-new in--

27:17.420 --> 27:21.170
- 3.14 minutes.
- Okay, okay.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.710
Yeah, shut up and run.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.680
I always thought it was
a myth that Outlanders

27:32.860 --> 27:36.310
could breathe out here without
respirators, but it's true.

27:37.030 --> 27:40.770
Enough time out here, and your
physiology really does adapt.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.440
If only we knew that
back then.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.780
I should have
gone back for you.

27:48.330 --> 27:49.820
I shouldn't
have listened to him.

27:51.290 --> 27:53.870
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't have a choice.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.290
Father didn't give us one,
did he?

27:56.460 --> 28:00.170
Training us to be brutal,
vicious warriors.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.500
Turning us against each other
to prove our worth,

28:03.680 --> 28:05.710
to prove ourselves to him.

28:10.430 --> 28:12.680
It's what I did to Lyta.

28:16.020 --> 28:19.270
Of course my daughter
did this to me...

28:19.480 --> 28:21.400
as I did what I did to you.

28:23.030 --> 28:25.900
I refuse to perpetuate
that cycle.

28:26.120 --> 28:29.070
The House of Zod
builds killers!

28:30.620 --> 28:32.490
I won't do it anymore.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.010
That's enough for today.
Dismissed.

28:48.470 --> 28:50.800
Cadet, stay a moment
after class?

28:52.430 --> 28:53.920
Primus.

28:54.190 --> 28:56.720
That was quite a turn
you gave me there.

28:56.900 --> 28:58.140
You told us to give you
our best.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.820
You don't know
what your best is yet.

29:01.530 --> 29:03.610
- What's your name?
- Lor-Ran.

29:04.610 --> 29:06.270
And where are you from,
Cadet Ran?

29:06.910 --> 29:07.940
Sector Six.

29:09.330 --> 29:10.740
The Old Rankless District.

29:11.660 --> 29:14.950
I-I knew someone
from there once.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.450
He, uh--
he meant a lot to me.

29:35.770 --> 29:37.850
No. He wouldn't do that.

29:39.770 --> 29:40.980
I'm sorry.

29:42.690 --> 29:43.680
You're not him.

29:45.990 --> 29:46.690
I thought we were--

29:51.240 --> 29:52.110
What did I do?

30:09.970 --> 30:10.840
You're not him.

30:19.690 --> 30:20.890
Would you judge me
if I told you

30:21.060 --> 30:22.930
that I peed
a little bit back there?

30:23.110 --> 30:25.190
Because that guy
is a freaking psychopath.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.320
I mean, I thought that
we were toast for sure,

30:27.570 --> 30:29.940
till you opened up
a family-size can of whoop-ass.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.650
- Yeah, we got lucky.
- Lucky?

30:32.870 --> 30:35.080
No, you're going to have to
do better than that.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.490
I mean, what the hell, man?

30:36.710 --> 30:38.200
You and Brainiac are,
like, together?

30:38.420 --> 30:40.450
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure, okay?

30:41.460 --> 30:43.200
I d-don't understand it myself.

30:43.420 --> 30:45.160
Well, why don't you use
a little bit

30:45.340 --> 30:47.170
of that extra brain juice
to figure it out?

30:47.340 --> 30:48.830
I mean, we got to know
how this thing works.

30:49.010 --> 30:50.420
Are you guys
just sharing a body

30:50.510 --> 30:52.880
- or DNA intertwined or--
- I don't know!

30:54.640 --> 30:57.180
- I don't know.
- Okay.

30:57.390 --> 30:59.550
I--

30:59.730 --> 31:01.340
I can't remember anything.

31:01.810 --> 31:04.600
Okay,
because it seemed different

31:04.780 --> 31:06.860
to what happened
to Rhom and the Voice of Rao.

31:07.030 --> 31:08.440
I mean, with them,
Brainiac definitely

31:08.610 --> 31:10.070
had the wheel,
and they were just passengers.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.320
But you with you,
it's--it's like...

31:13.580 --> 31:17.410
Wait. You're--you're
in the driver's seat, right?

31:18.580 --> 31:20.490
Yeah. Yeah.

31:20.870 --> 31:22.360
Maybe.
I don't know.

31:22.630 --> 31:24.370
Oh, God.

31:24.590 --> 31:26.290
Hey, are you okay?

31:30.090 --> 31:31.210
I don't know
if I'm gonna be able

31:31.390 --> 31:32.800
to hold him off much longer.

31:33.010 --> 31:35.920
Uh, okay.
How long you think you got?

31:36.890 --> 31:38.050
How should I know, Adam?

31:39.680 --> 31:41.020
- Right.
- Right.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.730
2.37 hours.

31:49.570 --> 31:51.400
Okay, that is
annoyingly precise.

31:51.570 --> 31:52.810
It's all right.
We're going to be fine.

31:53.030 --> 31:54.440
If anyone can
figure it out, it's--

31:55.280 --> 31:55.990
You wouldn't happen to know

31:56.160 --> 31:58.030
how to get in touch
with Val real quick, would you?

31:58.200 --> 31:59.820
- What?
- No, we're fine.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.530
It's fine, fine.

32:01.710 --> 32:03.740
Just need to, uh, get
to that maniac's picnic spot

32:03.920 --> 32:06.200
and get the Zeta-Beam.

32:06.590 --> 32:07.750
It'll be fun.

32:08.090 --> 32:10.880
I'm coming for you,
you bastiches!

32:32.450 --> 32:33.780
Would you like to tell me
what happened?

32:34.740 --> 32:35.900
I tried to find out
from Cadet Ran,

32:36.120 --> 32:38.320
but he couldn't say
on account of his broken jaw,

32:38.950 --> 32:40.320
amongst other injuries.

32:43.330 --> 32:45.120
Will he be all right?

32:46.590 --> 32:47.620
Depends.

32:48.250 --> 32:50.790
Are you planning
on visiting him?

32:53.880 --> 32:56.050
Then I expect he'll be fine.

32:59.350 --> 33:03.510
For a moment, he--
he reminded me of someone.

33:06.350 --> 33:10.810
And it faded, like--like
a memory just out of reach.

33:14.650 --> 33:17.860
That person can't be replaced.

33:18.450 --> 33:20.280
Can't be built over.

33:23.410 --> 33:25.320
I look down at the city.

33:26.460 --> 33:29.420
All of these changes--
it's truly visionary.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.920
But where you see progress...

33:35.510 --> 33:37.590
I see what
isn't there anymore...

33:39.010 --> 33:40.670
what I've lost.

33:43.140 --> 33:45.430
And sometimes
it's all I can see.

33:48.650 --> 33:52.140
And, uh, I don't know
how to go on.

33:56.070 --> 33:57.190
Wait right here.

34:13.420 --> 34:15.080
This is how you go on.

34:16.260 --> 34:18.969
This child...
is the future.

34:19.429 --> 34:23.300
- The child of Nyssa-Vex?
- The child of Seg-El.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.560
Go on, hold him.

34:35.150 --> 34:39.489
Seg sacrificed himself
because he believed in Krypton.

34:39.659 --> 34:41.520
How could his...

34:43.199 --> 34:46.610
sacrifice
possibly serve Krypton?

34:46.750 --> 34:49.580
- He's gone.
- Because his legacy lives on--

34:49.790 --> 34:52.780
in Cor, in me...

34:53.960 --> 34:55.580
and in you.

34:57.630 --> 34:59.710
We both lost
someone important to us...

35:00.390 --> 35:01.800
someone irreplaceable.

35:04.220 --> 35:07.560
But if you want to make
my father's sacrifice count...

35:08.520 --> 35:11.100
if you want
to heal the pain...

35:12.730 --> 35:15.190
you must let go of the past.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.360
Embrace the future.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.740
Help me build
a new one for Seg.

35:29.330 --> 35:31.370
He looks just like his father.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.240
Well...
here we are.

36:05.490 --> 36:08.200
Time for me to continue
on my own.

36:12.040 --> 36:13.500
Thank you.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.790
I couldn't have come this far
without you, brother.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.750
Good-bye, Vidar.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.960
- Help you?
- I'll take a drink.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.970
We're all out of everything.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.100
Sure about that?

37:20.480 --> 37:23.270
Sagitari scum
aren't welcome here.

37:23.650 --> 37:25.890
You must be mistaking me
for someone else.

37:26.070 --> 37:27.560
Rondor piss,
you're Jayna-Zod.

37:27.660 --> 37:30.700
Like I said, you've got
the wrong person.

37:30.870 --> 37:33.860
And like I said,
you're Jayna-Zod.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.420
Anyone else
think I'm Jayna-Zod?

37:50.510 --> 37:52.050
Didn't think so.

38:08.070 --> 38:09.480
You're late.

38:09.740 --> 38:11.610
You were meant
to check in hours ago.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.320
It's not that easy. They have
a guard watching me full-time.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.110
Did you pass on
the information?

38:16.370 --> 38:18.700
<i>Yes, but they're
still suspicious.</i>

38:18.920 --> 38:21.120
Then you need to
regain their trust quickly,

38:21.380 --> 38:22.910
<i>because I need you
to find the Codex</i>

38:23.130 --> 38:24.290
<i>and then bring it to me.</i>

38:50.450 --> 38:51.360
Evening.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.990
So this is where the drunks
and the derelicts are--

38:55.160 --> 38:57.450
hiding out in the snow when
there's a civilized society

38:57.620 --> 38:59.360
just a skimmer's ride away.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.460
Relax.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
We're not here sweeping up
fugitives for cannon fodder.

39:07.220 --> 39:09.750
Today's a special assignment.

39:10.340 --> 39:14.010
We're looking for a traitor.
Used to be one of our own.

39:14.970 --> 39:16.090
Might even be
some credits in it

39:16.310 --> 39:17.800
for anyone offering assistance.

39:25.730 --> 39:26.970
Jayna-Zod?

39:45.420 --> 39:47.830
- Dev.
- Hello, Jayna.

39:48.090 --> 39:51.000
Long time.

39:56.430 --> 39:58.920
Got it.

40:00.690 --> 40:01.720
Let's get out of here.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.310
Who knows how far away
that crazy bastard is?

40:04.400 --> 40:07.520
Okay, this is it, buddy.

40:07.650 --> 40:09.690
It's going to take
some cracker-jack timing.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.110
You ready to
get back to Krypton?

40:13.700 --> 40:16.110
- You can't do that.
- Whoa.

40:16.990 --> 40:19.080
Your eyes are getting blacker
by the minute.

40:19.870 --> 40:22.580
- Is it still you in there?
- Mostly.

40:25.790 --> 40:26.750
Listen, Adam...

40:29.510 --> 40:31.750
- I can't go back to Krypton.
- What?

40:31.930 --> 40:33.760
- What are you talking about?
- Listen...

40:34.890 --> 40:38.500
If we go home
with Brainiac still in here,

40:38.680 --> 40:40.670
then he's going to come with
us, and we can't risk that.

40:41.680 --> 40:44.640
It must end for Brainiac here.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.480
Okay.

40:52.650 --> 40:54.240
We'll figure a way
to get him out of you,

40:55.450 --> 40:56.980
and then we go.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.620
Either that, or you kill me.

40:59.870 --> 41:01.200
- What, what?
- You kill me.

41:01.410 --> 41:02.820
- You understand me?
- No. No!

41:03.000 --> 41:05.330
Adam, Adam,
this is bigger than me.

41:07.380 --> 41:09.080
This is bigger than me.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.300
I need you to promise.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.080
I...
