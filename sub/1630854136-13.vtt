00:09.400 --> 00:11.402
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:11.402 --> 00:12.751
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:12.751 --> 00:15.232
<i>by two separate,
yet equally important groups:</i>

00:15.232 --> 00:17.060
<i>the police,
who investigate crime,</i>

00:17.060 --> 00:19.845
<i>and the district attorneys,
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:19.845 --> 00:21.760
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:22.892 --> 00:24.720
Thanks, Professor.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.070
I'll let my team know
the good news

00:27.070 --> 00:30.682
and we'll have a business plan
ready for you by next week.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.032
Talk soon.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.753
DOA's a Hudson grad student
named Emily Wade.

00:57.753 --> 01:00.582
27, two in the chest.
- Witnesses?

01:00.582 --> 01:02.671
Just the classmate
who found her.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.629
Didn't see anything,
but she was pretty shaken up.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.240
Said she was
the most intelligent

01:06.240 --> 01:08.285
and driven woman
she'd ever met.

01:08.285 --> 01:10.070
Where is this classmate now?

01:10.070 --> 01:12.202
EMTs are treating her
for shock.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.421
Evidence of a break-in?

01:13.421 --> 01:15.988
No, looks like
it all went down outside.

01:15.988 --> 01:17.599
- Cameras?
- Afraid not.

01:17.599 --> 01:20.384
Off-campus housing.
Security's pretty lax.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.212
All right, let's see
what footage we can find

01:22.212 --> 01:24.432
from businesses
and traffic cams, huh?

01:24.432 --> 01:27.348
I'd ballpark time of death
as 9:30.

01:27.348 --> 01:28.653
Any indication of assault?

01:28.653 --> 01:30.525
No.
But some blood splatter.

01:30.525 --> 01:31.874
Means the shooter
was point blank.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.049
I'll check inside.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.094
Probably got hit
with some droplets.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.530
Yup.

01:39.011 --> 01:41.492
"Thinking of you."

01:41.492 --> 01:43.364
Doesn't say who it's from
or where it's from.

01:43.364 --> 01:46.454
Can you bag that? Thanks.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.630
You already check this?

01:50.022 --> 01:52.547
Cell phone still here.

01:52.547 --> 01:55.463
Wallet, credit cards, money.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.465
Doesn't look like anyone
tossed the place.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.728
There's jewelry still
along the nightstand.

01:59.728 --> 02:01.730
So it's not a robbery,
not an assault.

02:01.730 --> 02:02.861
Double tap to the chest.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.167
Starting to feel like
an execution.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.343
The question is why.
- Sad.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.780
Seems like she was
going places too.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.652
Too bad she'll never
get there now.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.618
I was dropping off
a statistics outline

03:03.618 --> 03:06.316
Em had loaned me.
Saw this van speeding off.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.752
What'd the van look like?

03:07.752 --> 03:10.538
Uh, blue.
Green stripe down the side.

03:10.538 --> 03:13.018
You get a look at the plates
or the driver?

03:13.018 --> 03:14.629
Sorry. No.

03:14.629 --> 03:17.066
How well did you know
the victim?

03:17.066 --> 03:18.720
We were study partners.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.245
Can you think of anybody
she had a problem with?

03:23.638 --> 03:25.248
Yeah.

03:25.248 --> 03:26.771
We'd get drinks at this place

03:26.771 --> 03:29.252
in Dumbo on Wednesdays
called Ewing's.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.036
She didn't want to go
last week.

03:31.036 --> 03:34.126
Said she was fighting with
one of the bartenders.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.258
You know what the issue
was about?

03:35.258 --> 03:36.912
No.

03:36.912 --> 03:40.437
But he apparently followed her
to the library the other day.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.880
Sorry, guys,
not open till five.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.056
Nathan Brae.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.319
Who's asking?

03:52.319 --> 03:53.450
We're New York City detectives.

03:53.450 --> 03:55.060
We need a word.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.252
Give me your hands.
Give me your hands.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.210
I didn't do anything wrong.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.346
I only ran because
I had coke on me.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.651
I didn't want
to get in trouble.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.784
Good instincts,
so unless you start talking,

04:22.784 --> 04:24.568
we're gonna charge you
with possession.

04:24.568 --> 04:27.397
What's your beef with
Emily Wade?

04:27.397 --> 04:29.356
I was dating her friend, Alli.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.748
It was going good, too,

04:30.748 --> 04:32.794
until she dumped me
out of the blue last week.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.013
Turns out Emily's been dissing
me all over the place.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.754
I was pissed.
- Is that why you followed her

04:36.754 --> 04:39.409
to the library?
- Yeah.

04:39.409 --> 04:40.932
I told her to stay the hell
out of my life

04:40.932 --> 04:42.717
and then some muscle-head
gets in between us

04:42.717 --> 04:44.327
and tells me to back off,
so I did.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.503
And you didn't go back to
her place later that evening,

04:46.503 --> 04:48.070
try to finish the conversation?
- No.

04:48.070 --> 04:49.898
There's no point, you know?

04:49.898 --> 04:51.595
- So where were you?
- What do you mean?

04:51.595 --> 04:54.424
Why do you care?
- Because Emily Wade is dead.

04:56.339 --> 04:59.821
Nathan Brae's alibi checks out.
Nothing on canvass either.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.649
Any next of kin
we can talk to?

05:01.649 --> 05:02.867
Nobody even to notify.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.478
Her parents died
when she was five.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.783
She was raised in foster care.

05:05.783 --> 05:08.220
So what about this
mysterious blue van?

05:08.220 --> 05:09.961
Snake eyes.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.355
Got something here, Lieutenant.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.966
This is last Wednesday afternoon

05:14.966 --> 05:17.795
outside Drummond Library.

05:17.795 --> 05:20.363
There's our boy,
giving her the what for.

05:20.363 --> 05:23.714
The argument
doesn't get very far.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.934
Huh, looks like
our Good Samaritan's

05:25.934 --> 05:27.762
no random bystander.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.546
Any chance we can get an ID?

05:29.546 --> 05:31.461
I already sent the image
to FIS.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.681
This is what
they just sent back.

05:33.681 --> 05:36.379
Bobby Gorman, 28, ex-Marine.

05:36.379 --> 05:39.513
Any recent contact
with Emily?

05:39.513 --> 05:42.167
Lot of romantic
back and forth.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.517
Whoa.

05:43.517 --> 05:46.476
Punctuated by a nasty DM
he sent early yesterday

05:46.476 --> 05:49.349
accusing her
of cheating on him.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.308
"I'm so angry,
I could kill you."

05:52.308 --> 05:55.355
We got an address
on this charmer?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.661
- Sheepshead Bay.
- All right, guys.

05:57.661 --> 06:00.360
Dust off your E-ZPass.
You're going to Brooklyn.

06:06.975 --> 06:10.457
I found out about Emily
on Citizen.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.372
I can't believe she's gone.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.199
Were you two together?

06:14.199 --> 06:15.679
For a few months.

06:15.679 --> 06:19.161
- How was it going?
- Ups and downs.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.468
But I saw a future there.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.818
Let's talk about
those downs then, huh?

06:23.818 --> 06:27.343
Like you threatening
to kill her.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.432
What? You think I did this?

06:29.432 --> 06:30.651
We think you need
to explain why

06:30.651 --> 06:34.176
you were sending her
threatening texts.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.830
I felt terrible about that.

06:35.830 --> 06:38.267
I was just venting.
- About what?

06:38.267 --> 06:40.487
All she did was study.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.184
Barely had any time for me.

06:42.184 --> 06:44.186
So I showed up
at her place on Thursday

06:44.186 --> 06:46.449
to surprise her
with Knicks tickets,

06:46.449 --> 06:49.844
but she was on her way out,
all dressed up.

06:49.844 --> 06:53.543
She claimed she had
a family issue to deal with.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.850
You go by her place
last night for any reason?

06:55.850 --> 06:58.461
No.

06:58.461 --> 07:02.160
Look, I didn't kill her.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.902
I loved her.

07:07.775 --> 07:11.256
Key card to Gorman's loft
confirms his alibi.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.041
So where are we with

07:13.041 --> 07:16.261
the unspecified family issues
that he alluded to?

07:16.261 --> 07:18.220
Still looking for the family.

07:18.220 --> 07:21.397
All right, so let's work back
from the time of the murder.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.747
What was Emily doing that day?
Where was she?

07:23.747 --> 07:25.619
Who was she with?
- Already on it.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.229
I pulled Emily's financials.

07:27.229 --> 07:31.233
Found an Uber charge the day
of the murder at 4:14 p.m.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.365
- Hmm.
- Where'd she go?

07:37.848 --> 07:41.417
Yes, I met with
the poor soul

07:41.417 --> 07:43.593
day before yesterday.
- About what?

07:43.593 --> 07:46.291
Her foster brother, Lonnie,
is a member here.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.511
She was worried about him.

07:48.511 --> 07:51.209
What was she worried about,
Pastor Butler?

07:51.209 --> 07:54.909
Uh, it's Pastor Mike,
and no offense, Detectives,

07:54.909 --> 07:58.608
but I take my parishioners'
privacy very seriously.

07:58.608 --> 08:01.742
We understand, but Emily
was murdered shortly after

08:01.742 --> 08:04.048
she left here,
so you have to understand

08:04.048 --> 08:08.357
that we need to know why
she was so concerned about him.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.794
Yes.

08:10.794 --> 08:13.101
He'd been asking her for money.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.451
She was worried about the
direction his life was taking.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.758
What direction
are we talking about?

08:17.758 --> 08:20.761
She asked that
I motivate him to find a job.

08:20.761 --> 08:24.329
I told her I would do my best
and she left.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.854
Excuse me for a second.
Reverend Sherman.

08:28.899 --> 08:31.336
Liturgy looks perfect, Henry.
Thank you.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.471
Lord's work is never done.

08:35.471 --> 08:36.864
Speaking of the Lord's work--

08:36.864 --> 08:38.561
it's been a minute since
I was an altar boy,

08:38.561 --> 08:42.609
but why would Emily think
career advice

08:42.609 --> 08:44.872
is something
that's in your portfolio?

08:44.872 --> 08:49.180
The success of our flock
glorifies God,

08:49.180 --> 08:51.922
so part of our work is to
guide them to milk and honey.

08:51.922 --> 08:55.012
As Jesus said,
"I came that they may have life

08:55.012 --> 08:56.753
and have it abundantly."

08:56.753 --> 08:58.625
And that's your thing?
Abundance?

08:58.625 --> 09:02.803
Yes. My congregation
is very generous.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.761
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

09:04.761 --> 09:07.459
We'll let you know
if there's any follow-up.

09:10.462 --> 09:13.814
- Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
- Tell me how you really feel.

09:13.814 --> 09:16.294
Don't tell me you didn't see
that fancy, schmancy suit

09:16.294 --> 09:17.687
and $10,000 watch.

09:17.687 --> 09:19.994
He's bleeding that
congregation dry.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.648
It's a little more
complicated than that.

09:21.648 --> 09:24.302
A guy like that--
he takes, but he also gives.

09:24.302 --> 09:26.348
How so?

09:26.348 --> 09:28.611
Some of these folks are
having trouble finding a job,

09:28.611 --> 09:30.961
paying rent, even harder time
staying positive.

09:30.961 --> 09:32.484
No different from
any church I know.

09:32.484 --> 09:33.703
Yeah, but Pastor Mike

09:33.703 --> 09:35.400
fills a void for people
who feel hopeless.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.968
He's modeling success

09:37.968 --> 09:39.927
so that his congregation
has something to aspire to.

09:39.927 --> 09:42.538
- Not my idea of religion.
- Not mine either.

09:42.538 --> 09:45.236
But religion is whatever
works for you, right?

09:45.236 --> 09:47.848
So some people think
it's the body of Christ

09:47.848 --> 09:49.197
being represented by a wafer.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.678
Some people think
it's ponying up so the pastor

09:51.678 --> 09:53.680
can wear a Rolex.
- I am not buying it.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.031
He's not selling it to you.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.554
Prosperity means
something different

09:58.554 --> 10:01.470
when you grow up
poor and Black, Frank.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.559
Fair enough.

10:03.559 --> 10:05.126
Let's check with
Emily's foster brother.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.780
See what he knows.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.783
Emily and I spent five years
in this group home in Canarsie.

10:09.783 --> 10:12.568
The only thing we got out
of that place was each other.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.485
She was my big sis.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.835
- Sorry for your loss, Lonnie.
- Yeah.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.402
We're trying
to piece together

10:20.402 --> 10:22.056
Emily's movements
two days ago.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.927
When was the last time
you saw her?

10:25.755 --> 10:29.498
I went by her place
about lunch.

10:29.498 --> 10:32.153
Now, would you say that was a
social call or something else?

10:34.372 --> 10:36.157
I needed her
to float me rent.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.680
Oh, you were having
money problems?

10:37.680 --> 10:41.249
I got laid off a month ago.

10:41.249 --> 10:42.946
Savings are a little light.

10:42.946 --> 10:46.950
I mean, I couldn't imagine
how that conversation might go

10:46.950 --> 10:50.562
between me and my sister if I
was asking her to pay my rent.

10:50.562 --> 10:53.435
You guys didn't fight or argue,
did you?

10:53.435 --> 10:56.699
No, she was happy to do it.

10:56.699 --> 10:59.615
She even had the money wired
to my landlord.

10:59.615 --> 11:00.964
How much money
we talking about?

11:00.964 --> 11:02.662
Two grand.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.709
Yeah, well,
the brother's story checks out.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.798
Then let's follow
the money trail.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.801
Communication just finished
the work up on her device.

11:11.801 --> 11:14.717
GPS puts her at the corner
of 11th and Avenue C

11:14.717 --> 11:17.067
right after eight
on the night of the murder.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.287
The address is a match
for a pawn shop

11:19.287 --> 11:20.854
called Sid's Jewelry and Loans.

11:20.854 --> 11:23.117
There ought to be security
cams on that street, right?

11:23.117 --> 11:24.509
Searching now.

11:24.509 --> 11:26.947
Pawn shop's got them
on front and back.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.644
This is at 8:20.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.124
That looks like Emily.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.648
Hey, can you get
in tighter on that guy?

11:32.648 --> 11:35.129
Yes,
but you never see his face.

11:35.129 --> 11:38.219
All right, well,
fast forward on the tape.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.961
- This is 8:32.
- She hawks something,

11:40.961 --> 11:43.137
and then an hour later,
she's dead.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.748
GPS confirms her next stop
was home.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.361
Freeze that.

11:50.361 --> 11:53.843
Yeah, blue van,
green pinstripe.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.932
Got a shot of the driver too.

11:55.932 --> 11:58.630
Can't make out details,
but it looks like a Black male

11:58.630 --> 12:02.069
wearing the same New York logo
hat as the guy on the street.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.375
Could fit the bill of the van
leaving the murder scene.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.812
Can you pull up
the registration?

12:05.812 --> 12:08.553
Plate comes back
to Ruben Grandy,

12:08.553 --> 12:10.164
Astoria.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.643
He's got priors
for armed robbery.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.254
All right, bring him in.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.178
Police!

12:24.178 --> 12:25.657
Show me your hands.
- Don't move!

12:25.657 --> 12:27.355
Take it easy, fellas.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.879
- Who else is here?
- Nobody, I swear to God.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.402
- All rooms clear.
- Clear.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.709
- Let's go.
- All right, keep your hands up

12:33.709 --> 12:35.624
and stand up for me.
Let's go.

12:35.624 --> 12:36.799
All right,
but I'ma need my crutches.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.627
I got a broken leg.

12:48.115 --> 12:51.292
I told you, I was playing
poker here with some friends.

12:51.292 --> 12:54.121
- Where's your van?
- Gave it away a few weeks ago.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.558
- To who?
- My church. First Harmony.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.821
Cast won't come off till
summer, so I can't drive.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.780
I was happy to send it
their way too.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.391
- And why's that?
- Guy that runs the church,

13:03.391 --> 13:06.829
Pastor Mike, he's a good man.

13:06.829 --> 13:09.310
Found me a job when
I got out of Sing Sing.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.834
So Pastor Mike is the one
driving the van now.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.532
No, he gave it
to the vice pastor,

13:14.532 --> 13:16.839
Reverend Sherman.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.755
Yes, I was driving
Ruben's van.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.583
My car is in the shop.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.106
Where'd you go
after you left the church?

13:23.106 --> 13:24.804
Home.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.415
You have any interaction with
Emily Wade couple nights ago?

13:27.415 --> 13:29.678
- Who?
- Emily Wade.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.898
Her brother's Lonnie Ballard.
He's a congregant.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.683
Mm.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.032
Before I say anything else,

13:36.032 --> 13:37.773
I need to know why
you're asking that.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.427
That van was used
in the commission

13:39.427 --> 13:41.821
of the murder of Emily Wade.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.257
You accusing me of something?

13:43.257 --> 13:45.172
You stop by a pawn shop
that night around 8:30,

13:45.172 --> 13:48.915
maybe one on 11th and Avenue C?
- No.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.655
So you're saying
you went straight home

13:50.655 --> 13:52.005
from First Harmony
and you never left.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.877
Is that right, Henry?
- It's Reverend Sherman.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.966
You'd do well to remember
who you're talking to.

14:00.796 --> 14:03.712
We know exactly
who we're talking to.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.714
An ex-con with a rap sheet
as long as my arm

14:05.714 --> 14:07.890
and a seven-year stint
in Fishkill.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.936
And now, all of a sudden,
you're a man of the cloth?

14:09.936 --> 14:12.025
- Meaning what?
- Meaning you're no bishop,

14:12.025 --> 14:14.288
so you need to account for your
whereabouts two nights ago.

14:14.288 --> 14:17.595
The only one
I need to account to is God.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.641
And I won't stand here
and be insulted...

14:19.641 --> 14:21.295
- Hey.
- For devoting my life

14:21.295 --> 14:22.818
to the almighty.
- Calm down.

14:22.818 --> 14:24.646
- You can see yourselves out.
- You're on parole.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.126
You're not going anywhere.

14:26.126 --> 14:28.302
both: Hey, hey. Wait.
- Yo, take your hands off of me.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.304
Hey, Henry.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.349
We got a church too.

14:32.349 --> 14:34.699
And putting hands
on my partner,

14:34.699 --> 14:36.788
that's a sin.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.662
Let's try this again.
- I already told you.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.969
I was at the church until six
then I went home.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.927
How do you explain the fact
that you were seen

14:44.927 --> 14:46.973
in that van driving away
from the church?

14:46.973 --> 14:49.889
That same van was spotted
a few hours later

14:49.889 --> 14:51.716
fleeing the scene
of Emily's shooting.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.066
Someone else
had to be driving it.

14:53.066 --> 14:54.937
Somebody else
is driving your van?

14:54.937 --> 14:57.679
Yeah, I left the keys on the
front tire when I parked it.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.202
And why would you do that?

14:59.202 --> 15:01.335
So parishioners in need
of transportation can use it.

15:01.335 --> 15:04.294
You got callers for
possession and burglary.

15:04.294 --> 15:07.515
Maybe you're using again.
Maybe you're hard up for cash

15:07.515 --> 15:09.212
and you saw Emily
as an easy target.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.648
- You're wrong.
- I don't think I am.

15:10.648 --> 15:13.956
I'm searching your van.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.045
- You okay with all this?
- With what?

15:16.045 --> 15:17.351
End of the day,

15:17.351 --> 15:20.745
you got to decide whose side
you're really on.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.834
I've already decided, brother.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.533
I'm on God's side.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.057
Turns out,
he doesn't like murder.

15:29.798 --> 15:32.844
There's a baseball cap
with a New York logo on it

15:32.844 --> 15:35.717
and there's blood
on the armrest.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.675
Blood.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.721
You want to explain that?
- I'm not talking.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.114
Well, maybe you'll talk
to a jury.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.116
You're under arrest for
the murder of Emily Wade.

15:46.771 --> 15:49.296
Calling docket
ending in 2129.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.906
People versus Henry Sherman

15:50.906 --> 15:53.387
charged with murder
in the second degree.

15:53.387 --> 15:54.954
How does the defendant plead?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.999
Not guilty, Your Honor.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.958
I'll hear the people on bail.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.263
We're seeking remand.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.700
The defendant
stalked the victim,

16:02.700 --> 16:05.442
followed her home,
then shot her to death

16:05.442 --> 16:07.183
during a botched robbery.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.880
Evidence is substantial.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.926
We found the victim's blood
in a van

16:10.926 --> 16:12.754
that the defendant
had control over--

16:12.754 --> 16:15.800
the same van seen leaving
the victim's apartment

16:15.800 --> 16:18.107
shortly after the murder.
- Mr. Gale.

16:18.107 --> 16:21.589
My client is a highly
respected member of the clergy.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.025
With a lengthy
criminal record.

16:23.025 --> 16:26.507
Who's lived an exemplary life
since finding God.

16:26.507 --> 16:29.597
There's no eye witnesses,
no gun,

16:29.597 --> 16:31.207
no evidence of motive.

16:31.207 --> 16:35.342
No one can put my client
behind the wheel of that van

16:35.342 --> 16:37.257
at the time of the murder.

16:37.257 --> 16:40.086
An argument you're free
to make at trial, Mr. Gale.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.262
Bail is set at $1 million.

16:45.743 --> 16:50.009
Case is solid,
but our motive is still weak.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.968
Why on Earth would this man
kill Emily Wade?

16:52.968 --> 16:55.405
Does it matter?
If we can prove he shot her,

16:55.405 --> 16:57.320
his motive's irrelevant.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.931
My mentor taught me that.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.064
Yes, but he also taught you

17:02.064 --> 17:04.980
juries hate cases
that don't make sense.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.852
You're right. He did.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.986
So let's dig deeper.

17:10.986 --> 17:14.381
Find a credible reason why
Sherman wanted to kill Emily.

17:14.381 --> 17:18.037
Scour his texts, email,
phone records, financials.

17:21.692 --> 17:24.652
Mm-hmm.

17:24.652 --> 17:28.264
A V12.
- Gentlemen.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.049
Pastor Mike.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.876
Nice ride.
You got a minute?

17:31.876 --> 17:34.488
I'd love to chat,
but I'm late.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.620
One of my oldest and dearest
congregants is quite ill.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.623
I'm heading over to the
hospital to pray with him.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.321
Help him find peace
before he passes.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.497
Oh, that's fantastic,
so this won't take long.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.672
We just have a few questions.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.065
Sorry, I can't.
Not now.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.197
Oh, you misunderstand
my kindness here.

17:48.197 --> 17:51.505
I'm not asking.
I'm telling.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.333
You're telling?

17:53.333 --> 17:55.030
No, you don't get to tell me
a damn thing.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.163
Sure I do.
For starters, I'm telling you

17:57.163 --> 17:58.947
that we know that
vice Pastor Sherman

17:58.947 --> 18:03.778
deposited a $50,000 check
a day after Emily Wade was shot.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.519
So?

18:05.519 --> 18:08.043
So we want to know
what the check was for.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.958
- It's a private matter.
- Private?

18:09.958 --> 18:12.091
Sherman was charged
with murder,

18:12.091 --> 18:15.398
so anything he has said or done
is now a public matter.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.794
I'm done talking,
so you can either arrest me

18:19.794 --> 18:22.188
or step out of my way.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.979
Good day.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.079
Does your pastor
drive a Bentley?

18:44.079 --> 18:46.429
I don't go to church enough
to know.

18:52.827 --> 18:55.569
A superseding indictment
for first-degree murder.

18:55.569 --> 18:58.485
On what basis?
- Murder for hire.

18:58.485 --> 19:02.793
Pastor Mike paid your client
to kill Emily Wade.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.447
Is this a joke?

19:04.447 --> 19:06.797
Here are 50,000 reasons
it's not.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.933
So he makes
a $50,000 deposit.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.240
Who cares?
- I'm guessing the jury might

19:14.240 --> 19:16.111
since it was
the day after the murder

19:16.111 --> 19:17.591
from a First Harmony account.

19:17.591 --> 19:21.203
And phone logs show
Mr. Sherman called Pastor Mike

19:21.203 --> 19:24.598
just before and after
Emily Wade was shot to death.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.774
Look, if we're right,
and we are,

19:26.774 --> 19:29.646
you would be wise to cooperate.

19:29.646 --> 19:32.867
Tell us what really happened,
or there's a very good chance

19:32.867 --> 19:36.436
you'll die in prison.

19:36.436 --> 19:39.221
I've got nothing to say.

19:39.221 --> 19:43.399
You feel obligation
to Pastor Mike

19:43.399 --> 19:45.662
because he took you in,

19:45.662 --> 19:48.012
he gave you a job,
a purpose.

19:48.012 --> 19:51.581
But what he really did
is use you.

19:51.581 --> 19:56.020
That's why you're here
taking the rap and he's not.

19:58.806 --> 20:01.765
Murder two, 15 years.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.334
I'm not a rat.

20:14.474 --> 20:17.216
Hold on. Wait.

20:23.178 --> 20:26.616
How about man one,
ten years flat?

20:26.616 --> 20:29.663
We're listening.

20:29.663 --> 20:32.448
Pastor Mike was nervous.

20:32.448 --> 20:35.016
Said that Emily was a problem.

20:35.016 --> 20:37.148
That we needed
to shut her ass up.

20:37.148 --> 20:40.804
What did he mean by that?

20:40.804 --> 20:43.851
He wanted me to kill her.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.682
Why would he want to do that?

20:48.682 --> 20:53.034
She told Pastor Mike
she was gonna call the police

20:53.034 --> 20:55.950
if he didn't return
her brother's donation.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.300
Let them know what's really
going on in the church.

20:58.300 --> 21:02.043
- Is that some sort of secret?
- No.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.872
But Pastor Mike
doesn't like paying taxes

21:04.872 --> 21:09.311
or going to jail,
so he panicked.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.618
Okay.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.054
Yeah, we got a deal,

21:13.054 --> 21:15.970
assuming your story checks out,
of course.

21:20.279 --> 21:24.413
Did you give or donate money
to Pastor Mike?

21:24.413 --> 21:26.546
Yes.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.112
$40,000.

21:28.112 --> 21:31.333
- Did Emily know about this?
- Yes.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.379
I told her that day I asked her
to help me pay the rent.

21:33.379 --> 21:37.165
Well, when she heard about
the donation, was she upset?

21:37.165 --> 21:41.343
Did she tell you she was going
to go get your money back?

21:41.343 --> 21:44.346
She was upset.
She thought I was an idiot.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.261
But she didn't think
like I did.

21:46.261 --> 21:50.352
She's not a believer like me.

21:50.352 --> 21:53.312
Wait.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.748
You think Pastor Mike
has something to do

21:54.748 --> 21:56.619
with her murder?

21:56.619 --> 21:58.099
That is correct.

21:58.099 --> 22:00.231
When she found out
you gave him that money,

22:00.231 --> 22:03.713
she stormed over to the church
and demanded he give it back.

22:03.713 --> 22:06.020
Or she would inform
the police about his antics.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.543
What do you mean antics?

22:07.543 --> 22:10.372
Buying houses and boats
with his congregants'

22:10.372 --> 22:12.461
hard-earned cash.
- You're wrong.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.507
The money we give
helps with prosperity.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.117
It's part of the gospel.

22:16.117 --> 22:17.858
I know this is hard
for you to hear--

22:17.858 --> 22:19.947
Pastor Mike would never
hurt Emily.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.427
He's a healer.

22:21.427 --> 22:26.083
I mean, if it wasn't for him,
I'd probably be dead.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.998
I mean, he got me off heroin.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.613
And with all due respect,

22:33.613 --> 22:37.138
that has nothing to do with
your sister's case.

22:40.141 --> 22:43.536
I think I've had enough.

22:43.536 --> 22:46.147
Please leave.

22:46.147 --> 22:48.323
Now.

22:52.196 --> 22:53.502
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

22:53.502 --> 22:56.375
You want to go after a pillar
of the community,

22:56.375 --> 22:58.812
a clergyman,

22:58.812 --> 23:00.683
on the word
of a convicted felon

23:00.683 --> 23:02.468
with every reason to trade up.

23:02.468 --> 23:05.384
We believe Henry Sherman
is telling the truth.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.038
The victim's brother confirmed
the crux of his story.

23:08.038 --> 23:10.954
That's great,
but Sherman is still the felon

23:10.954 --> 23:13.870
with a fantastic motive
to lie his ass off.

23:13.870 --> 23:16.264
We're talking about
a religious leader

23:16.264 --> 23:19.615
who orchestrated someone's
murder to cover up his scheme.

23:19.615 --> 23:22.313
If we don't at least try
to hold someone like that

23:22.313 --> 23:24.925
accountable,
we're in the wrong line of work.

23:29.233 --> 23:32.672
Put Pastor Mike on trial,
not his church.

23:32.672 --> 23:36.415
If you lose religious jurors,
you won't have a prayer.

23:39.287 --> 23:42.769
<i>choir:
♪ Gonna lay down my burden</i>

23:42.769 --> 23:45.206
♪ Down by the riverside

23:45.206 --> 23:49.993
♪ Study war no more
- Yes.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.691
Lord.

23:51.691 --> 23:54.215
They live.
- Yes.

23:54.215 --> 23:57.044
- Praise the Lord.
- Yeah!

23:57.044 --> 23:58.915
Thank you, choir,
for lifting our spirits

23:58.915 --> 24:00.743
on the winds of your song.
Amen?

24:00.743 --> 24:02.353
all: Amen.
- Amen?

24:02.353 --> 24:03.964
all: Amen.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.226
I want to talk about

24:05.226 --> 24:07.707
the importance of
your financial support.

24:07.707 --> 24:10.057
What you give your church
will come back to you tenfold.

24:10.057 --> 24:13.016
all: Yes.
- Detectives.

24:13.016 --> 24:15.018
You're interrupting
our service.

24:15.018 --> 24:17.238
Pastor, we need a word.

24:17.238 --> 24:20.023
- You're gonna have to wait.
- Justice waits for no man.

24:21.634 --> 24:26.160
You're under arrest
for the murder of Emily Wade.

24:31.644 --> 24:35.691
Fear not, my children.
God has a plan.

24:35.691 --> 24:37.388
The righteous shall prevail.

24:41.436 --> 24:42.829
This is ludicrous.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.483
Do you seriously think

24:44.483 --> 24:46.397
that I'm involved
in this young woman's death?

24:46.397 --> 24:47.573
We do.

24:47.573 --> 24:50.227
Because Reverend Sherman
made up a story.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.665
He seemed pretty credible.

24:52.665 --> 24:56.364
Evidence supports it too.

24:56.364 --> 24:59.846
I suppose the darkness
from within was just

24:59.846 --> 25:01.238
too much for him to overcome.

25:01.238 --> 25:03.502
Yeah, that may be true,
but right now,

25:03.502 --> 25:06.940
you need to help yourself
and tell us what happened.

25:11.901 --> 25:14.338
I'm done talking.

25:14.338 --> 25:16.253
I want a lawyer.

25:16.253 --> 25:19.256
Reverend Sherman can say
whatever he wants,

25:19.256 --> 25:22.216
but the truth will prevail.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.745
After Emily Wade
left First Harmony,

25:29.745 --> 25:32.879
did you have occasion to confer
with Pastor Mike?

25:32.879 --> 25:35.272
- I did.
- And what did he tell you

25:35.272 --> 25:37.536
about the conversation
that he'd had with her?

25:44.630 --> 25:49.939
We didn't talk about her.
We talked about his sermon.

25:49.939 --> 25:52.463
He didn't tell you
that Ms. Wade

25:52.463 --> 25:54.248
wanted her brother's money back

25:54.248 --> 25:56.206
or she was gonna go
to the police?

25:56.206 --> 25:57.643
- No.
- He didn't tell you

25:57.643 --> 26:00.036
that she would destroy
everything you'd built,

26:00.036 --> 26:02.778
so you had to shut her up?
- No.

26:08.392 --> 26:11.439
Mr. Sherman,
did you or did you not tell me

26:11.439 --> 26:14.747
Pastor Mike paid you
to kill Emily Wade.

26:14.747 --> 26:17.097
I did tell you that,

26:17.097 --> 26:18.925
and I was lying
because I wanted a deal.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.319
Quiet or I'll clear
the gallery.

26:22.319 --> 26:26.454
The truth is you're lying now
out of some misguided

26:26.454 --> 26:28.151
sense of loyalty to your boss,
aren't you?

26:28.151 --> 26:30.719
I'm not lying.
I'm telling the truth.

26:30.719 --> 26:32.547
Sir, I remind you that
if you violate the terms

26:32.547 --> 26:34.462
of your plea agreement--
- Objection.

26:34.462 --> 26:37.334
Asked and answered.
- I agree.

26:37.334 --> 26:40.468
Mr. Price,
the witness' testimony

26:40.468 --> 26:42.339
is very clear.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.780
Nothing further.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.303
Mr. Dressler?

26:49.303 --> 26:50.957
No questions, Your Honor.

26:50.957 --> 26:53.916
The People request
a brief recess.

26:53.916 --> 26:55.657
We're adjourned
until tomorrow.

27:06.842 --> 27:09.497
Rikers' Visitor Log shows
Pastor Mike's attorney

27:09.497 --> 27:11.455
went to visit Sherman
in jail yesterday.

27:11.455 --> 27:15.111
Less than 24 hours later,
Sherman sandbags us.

27:15.111 --> 27:16.678
It's witness tampering.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.811
No doubt.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.769
But that's too hard to prove.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.641
We'll just have to make
the case without him.

27:27.776 --> 27:30.953
We were looking at calls
coming into Pastor Mike

27:30.953 --> 27:32.999
the day of the murder, right?

27:32.999 --> 27:34.348
Yeah, I'm not following.

27:34.348 --> 27:36.916
We know Sherman
called Pastor Mike

27:36.916 --> 27:38.657
right after he killed Emily.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.703
But according to this call log,
Pastor Mike called someone else

27:41.703 --> 27:44.837
as soon as that conversation
was finished.

27:44.837 --> 27:47.056
Let's find out who he called
and what he said.

27:52.061 --> 27:54.368
As Senior Pastor
of First Harmony,

27:54.368 --> 27:57.414
I don't have
day-to-day involvement.

27:57.414 --> 28:01.854
I function strictly
in an advisory capacity now.

28:01.854 --> 28:04.683
Yes, but that capacity includes

28:04.683 --> 28:07.120
the provision of counsel
to Pastor Mike, doesn't it?

28:07.120 --> 28:08.556
It does.

28:08.556 --> 28:12.081
Does he typically call you
in the evening?

28:12.081 --> 28:14.040
- He does not.
- But he did call you

28:14.040 --> 28:16.390
December 14th at night.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.957
What did you two talk about?

28:19.872 --> 28:21.743
I'm a preacher.

28:21.743 --> 28:24.267
Conversations with
my congregants are

28:24.267 --> 28:26.748
meant to be confidential.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.968
A woman was murdered.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.883
Doesn't that trump
confidentiality?

28:34.234 --> 28:38.629
He called me on that night
as his clergyman.

28:38.629 --> 28:42.633
He wanted
to unburden his soul,

28:42.633 --> 28:46.507
which means the nature
of that conversation

28:46.507 --> 28:50.903
is protected under the laws
of the State of New York.

28:50.903 --> 28:55.603
So just so I'm clear...

28:55.603 --> 28:59.781
you're okay
if a murderer walks free?

29:06.962 --> 29:11.967
I'm not talking, fellas.
Simple as that.

29:22.151 --> 29:24.893
Bryant is the whole ballgame.
He has to testify.

29:24.893 --> 29:29.289
But he's a clergyman.
And he's right about the law.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.900
His conversation with
the defendant is privileged.

29:31.900 --> 29:35.730
Unless that privilege is
in service of a crime or fraud.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.297
You're on dangerous ground, Nolan.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.429
To prove that,
you have to attack the church.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.083
I thought we agreed

29:41.083 --> 29:43.825
that we would make the case
about the man not the religion.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.087
I'm not going after religion.

29:45.087 --> 29:47.960
I'm going after
a single corrupt preacher.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.744
It'll read as blasphemy.

29:49.744 --> 29:51.659
Delegitimizing First Harmony

29:51.659 --> 29:54.183
is the only way
to convict Pastor Mike.

29:54.183 --> 29:56.055
Otherwise, we may as well
drop the charges.

29:56.055 --> 29:59.449
If we lose this case,
all people will remember

29:59.449 --> 30:01.756
is an over-zealous prosecutor

30:01.756 --> 30:04.628
who vilified a church
for no good reason.

30:04.628 --> 30:07.327
And that's all
I'm going to remember too.

30:10.243 --> 30:13.768
The mere suggestion
this trial should devolve into

30:13.768 --> 30:17.206
a referendum on the legitimacy
of First Harmony is outrageous.

30:17.206 --> 30:19.905
I take the point.
Mr. Price?

30:19.905 --> 30:24.126
The People are aware of
the sensitivities at play here.

30:24.126 --> 30:26.259
But we're only questioning
that legitimacy

30:26.259 --> 30:29.436
for the limited purposes
of a privilege inquiry.

30:29.436 --> 30:32.308
The phone call between
Pastor Mike and Pastor Bryant

30:32.308 --> 30:35.616
was obviously for the purpose
of seeking spiritual advice.

30:35.616 --> 30:37.313
Presumptively
for that purpose,

30:37.313 --> 30:39.881
a presumption
that can be overcome

30:39.881 --> 30:43.798
if we establish that the church
is a corrupt enterprise.

30:43.798 --> 30:45.931
I share your concerns,
Mr. Dressler,

30:45.931 --> 30:48.281
but this is a murder trial.

30:48.281 --> 30:50.936
So I'm gonna grant the People
a limited opportunity

30:50.936 --> 30:53.416
to demonstrate fraud.

30:53.416 --> 30:56.332
And the defense will have
the chance to rebut.

31:02.077 --> 31:06.908
Mr. Conley, how much did you
donate to First Harmony?

31:06.908 --> 31:09.519
$61,000 over three years.

31:09.519 --> 31:10.869
And during that time,

31:10.869 --> 31:13.741
did you experience
any financial setbacks?

31:13.741 --> 31:16.744
Yes.
I lost my home, my car.

31:16.744 --> 31:18.398
Couldn't even pay
the storage facility,

31:18.398 --> 31:19.878
so they sold my stuff.

31:19.878 --> 31:23.229
And yet you continued donating
to First Harmony, right?

31:23.229 --> 31:24.665
- Yes.
- Why?

31:24.665 --> 31:26.841
Because Pastor Mike told me
if I stopped giving,

31:26.841 --> 31:29.322
it could jeopardize
my relationship with God.

31:29.322 --> 31:32.238
The money you donated--
do you know where it went?

31:32.238 --> 31:34.327
Yeah. His Tesla.

31:34.327 --> 31:37.591
His mansion in Armonk.
His catamaran.

31:37.591 --> 31:40.681
What Pastor needs a catamaran?

31:40.681 --> 31:42.901
Nothing further.

31:46.426 --> 31:48.950
Mr. Conley,

31:48.950 --> 31:51.735
are you currently a member
of Gamblers Anonymous?

31:54.173 --> 31:55.478
Yes.

31:55.478 --> 31:57.959
And how much money
have you lost gambling

31:57.959 --> 31:59.439
the past three years?

31:59.439 --> 32:01.180
I don't remember.

32:01.180 --> 32:04.661
Nearly $200,000.
Is that right?

32:04.661 --> 32:06.446
I guess.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.622
So First Harmony
isn't the real cause

32:08.622 --> 32:10.798
of your financial woes,
is it?

32:10.798 --> 32:12.234
Doesn't matter.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.541
That man over there
stole from me.

32:21.069 --> 32:23.942
Mr. Ballard, you're
a recovering heroin addict.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.726
Is that right?
- Recovered.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.293
That's amazing.

32:27.293 --> 32:30.383
And to what do you attribute
your recovery?

32:30.383 --> 32:31.993
Pastor Mike.

32:31.993 --> 32:35.127
He got me into a facility,
paid for the program.

32:35.127 --> 32:36.911
Visited me every day
for six weeks

32:36.911 --> 32:38.391
to make sure
I was doing the work.

32:38.391 --> 32:40.697
Were you employed
as a sales rep

32:40.697 --> 32:42.656
for Shearing Pharmaceuticals?

32:42.656 --> 32:45.006
Yes, for four years.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.616
I just got laid off.

32:46.616 --> 32:49.402
I'm sorry about that.
And who got you that job?

32:49.402 --> 32:51.143
Pastor Mike.

32:51.143 --> 32:52.796
There's been testimony about

32:52.796 --> 32:55.321
Pastor Mike's
extravagant lifestyle.

32:55.321 --> 32:56.975
Are you familiar
with how he lives?

32:56.975 --> 32:58.237
Of course.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.543
And it's a blessing
to the congregation.

33:00.543 --> 33:03.111
Do you believe First Harmony
defrauded you in any way?

33:03.111 --> 33:05.592
No.
As Pastor Mike likes to say,

33:05.592 --> 33:08.682
"When we invest in the church,
we invest in ourselves."

33:08.682 --> 33:10.423
And I'm living proof
that's true.

33:10.423 --> 33:12.033
Thank you.

33:14.688 --> 33:15.950
Mr. Ballard,

33:15.950 --> 33:18.387
I'm very sorry about
the loss of your sister.

33:18.387 --> 33:20.911
Thank you.

33:20.911 --> 33:25.786
Until a short time ago,
what was your net worth?

33:25.786 --> 33:27.788
About $40,000.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.833
What's your net worth now?

33:29.833 --> 33:32.706
- Less than that.
- In fact, it is zero.

33:32.706 --> 33:36.753
Because you donated every cent
you had to First Harmony.

33:36.753 --> 33:38.146
I'll make more.

33:38.146 --> 33:40.975
How much have you given
First Harmony

33:40.975 --> 33:43.499
over the past four years?

33:43.499 --> 33:44.805
I don't remember.

33:44.805 --> 33:48.765
Does almost $90,000
sound right?

33:48.765 --> 33:53.031
I donated because
that's the right thing to do.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.120
I owe Pastor Mike.
I owe him.

33:55.120 --> 33:59.515
Well, isn't it possible that
the man you say you owe

33:59.515 --> 34:01.604
turned you into
a productive citizen

34:01.604 --> 34:04.694
in order to milk you
of everything you earned?

34:04.694 --> 34:07.567
No. Donating to your church
is the right thing to do.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.612
Pastor Mike deserves
every penny I gave him.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.527
Oh, you gave Pastor Mike
your money?

34:11.527 --> 34:14.139
No, no, I meant I--
I gave it to First Harm--

34:14.139 --> 34:16.010
this man is trying to fool me!

34:16.010 --> 34:17.751
No, sir.

34:17.751 --> 34:21.711
I am not the one fooling you.

34:21.711 --> 34:24.062
Nothing further.

34:30.111 --> 34:32.461
The parishioners who donated

34:32.461 --> 34:34.681
did so knowing that Pastor Mike
was spending at least

34:34.681 --> 34:37.162
some of the money on himself.

34:37.162 --> 34:39.729
No one was threatened
or coerced.

34:39.729 --> 34:44.125
They donated for inspiration,
which is exactly what they got.

34:44.125 --> 34:49.348
Pastor Mike's success
was a beacon to his parish,

34:49.348 --> 34:52.133
which is all that
the prosperity gospel entails.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.483
You get the benefit
of your bargain,

34:54.483 --> 34:58.052
it can't be fraud.

34:58.052 --> 35:01.142
Mr. Price?

35:01.142 --> 35:06.930
Fraud needn't be a function
of deceit or coercion.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.628
It can also be manipulation

35:08.628 --> 35:11.239
by a person
in a position of trust,

35:11.239 --> 35:15.156
such as a pastor
who tells his flock

35:15.156 --> 35:18.507
that their relationship with God
will be compromised

35:18.507 --> 35:21.684
if they don't give money
to the church.

35:21.684 --> 35:24.209
These donations were part
of a shameless money grab

35:24.209 --> 35:27.212
by a charismatic
and manipulative figure

35:27.212 --> 35:30.084
in a position
of control and power.

35:30.084 --> 35:33.914
The defendant concealed these
cash contributions from the IRS

35:33.914 --> 35:35.916
and used the money he received

35:35.916 --> 35:38.397
to finance
his opulent lifestyle.

35:38.397 --> 35:43.141
That is not religion.
That's fraud.

35:51.061 --> 35:54.500
I agree with Mr. Price.

35:54.500 --> 35:59.244
And since the defense
did not rebut his claims,

35:59.244 --> 36:02.638
I am vitiating
the clergy privilege.

36:15.216 --> 36:18.219
Mr. Price.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.003
Why you doing this?
- Excuse me?

36:20.003 --> 36:22.180
Trying to destroy my church.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.660
No, I can assure you,
that is not my objective.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.619
You're acting like we don't
know what we're doing,

36:26.619 --> 36:28.925
that Pastor Mike
is trying to defraud us.

36:28.925 --> 36:31.450
That's not
what's going on here.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.800
We know what we're doing.
We want to give him our money.

36:33.800 --> 36:37.804
That is your choice.
I--I don't really care.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.980
I'm simply trying to present
the facts to the jury

36:39.980 --> 36:41.895
so they know
what really happened--

36:41.895 --> 36:44.245
so they know who really
killed Emily, your sister.

36:44.245 --> 36:45.942
I-I would've thought
that's something

36:45.942 --> 36:47.117
you might be interested in
as well.

36:47.117 --> 36:49.032
Don't do that.

36:49.032 --> 36:53.036
Don't you dare suggest that
I don't love my sister Emily.

36:53.036 --> 36:56.257
I do. More than anything.

36:56.257 --> 36:57.432
But she's gone.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.434
Ain't nothing
we can do about that.

36:59.434 --> 37:00.827
And nothing you could do
to convince me

37:00.827 --> 37:02.524
that Pastor Mike is involved.

37:02.524 --> 37:05.048
- I won't bother trying.
- Wait, wait.

37:07.181 --> 37:10.750
I'm just scared.

37:10.750 --> 37:15.058
If you destroy Pastor Mike
and my church...

37:17.539 --> 37:20.629
I'm left with
absolutely nothing.

37:25.547 --> 37:27.419
Please.

37:41.389 --> 37:43.870
Pastor Mike Butler

37:43.870 --> 37:47.743
called you at 9:14 on the
evening of Emily Wade's murder.

37:49.745 --> 37:52.618
- He did.
- And what did he tell you?

37:59.538 --> 38:03.803
He told me
he wanted to pray with me

38:03.803 --> 38:07.285
because he had transgressed.

38:10.766 --> 38:15.641
Did he tell you exactly
what the transgression was?

38:15.641 --> 38:18.208
This is not right.

38:18.208 --> 38:21.168
That conversation was sacred.

38:21.168 --> 38:22.343
Pastor Bryant--

38:22.343 --> 38:25.477
Only God
should know the contents.

38:25.477 --> 38:29.394
Will the court please instruct
the witness to answer?

38:29.394 --> 38:32.135
Pastor Bryant,
the court has ruled

38:32.135 --> 38:34.137
clergy privilege
does not apply here.

38:34.137 --> 38:35.791
- Oh.
- If you don't answer,

38:35.791 --> 38:37.445
I will have to hold you
in contempt.

38:37.445 --> 38:39.186
Do you understand that?

38:42.929 --> 38:44.191
Yes.

38:44.191 --> 38:47.847
Ask your question again,
Mr. Price.

38:47.847 --> 38:50.980
I'll make it a simple
yes or no question.

38:50.980 --> 38:53.896
Did the defendant tell you

38:53.896 --> 38:58.205
that he had instructed
Mr. Sherman to kill Emily Wade?

39:03.950 --> 39:05.343
Yes.

39:21.446 --> 39:24.710
Nothing further.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.973
Then we are adjourned
for the day.

39:31.891 --> 39:33.936
Man one, 20 max.

39:33.936 --> 39:36.809
Murder two, 20 to life.

39:42.467 --> 39:45.339
I'll start drafting
the plea agreement.

39:45.339 --> 39:49.299
I'll, um,
talk to Emily's brother,

39:49.299 --> 39:51.693
let him know the case is over.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.662
Lonnie?

40:03.662 --> 40:06.708
It's Nolan Price
from the DA's office.

40:08.623 --> 40:11.800
Hello, Lonnie?

40:23.377 --> 40:26.206
Oh, no. Lonnie?

40:26.206 --> 40:28.904
Lonnie.

40:28.904 --> 40:31.211
Lonnie? Lonnie?

40:31.211 --> 40:32.734
Lonnie? Oh, God.

40:36.695 --> 40:39.393
Yeah, I-I need an ambulance.

40:39.393 --> 40:41.830
435 Warshaw, Queens.
Apartment 4B.

40:41.830 --> 40:44.572
He's overdosed.
I need help right away.

40:46.356 --> 40:49.882
Lonnie?
Lonnie, stay with me.
