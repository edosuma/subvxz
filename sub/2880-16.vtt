WEBVTT

00:02.752 --> 00:05.253
I'm thinking
about growing a goatee.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.871
Oh, actually that's a Van Dyke.

00:06.873 --> 00:08.706
A goatee is
just hair on the chin.

00:08.708 --> 00:11.776
Oh. Wait, then what is it
if you just have hair up here?

00:11.778 --> 00:12.761
You mean a moustache?

00:12.763 --> 00:15.013
Moo-stache!
He said it!

00:15.015 --> 00:17.315
Ha-ha, very funny.
Make fun of the foreign guy.

00:17.317 --> 00:19.267
For your information, there
are four times as many

00:19.269 --> 00:22.020
Indians as there are Americans,
so the way we say it is right.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.271
Say what?
Moo-stache.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.623
Moo-stache!
He said "moo-stache".

00:26.025 --> 00:27.892
Guys, you're
being childish.

00:27.894 --> 00:29.727
Yeah, she's right.
You're grown men,

00:29.729 --> 00:31.229
the kind who are
perfectly capable

00:31.231 --> 00:33.731
of growing your
own moo-staches.

00:34.834 --> 00:38.670
Hey, you were funny
on purpose-- good job.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.089
Hi. Sorry I'm late--
I was at an audition.

00:41.091 --> 00:43.675
Oh, I'm sorry.
You'll get 'em next time.

00:45.077 --> 00:48.780
How about instead of assuming I
failed, you ask me how it went?

00:48.782 --> 00:50.432
Sorry. How did it go?

00:50.434 --> 00:52.350
Just shut up.

00:52.352 --> 00:53.835
Here, you can
have your seat.

00:53.837 --> 00:56.421
No, no, no, stay there.
I'm fine on the floor.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.940
Have you guys ever thought about
getting a dining room table?

00:58.942 --> 01:01.359
Yeah. You actually do have
room for one up there.

01:01.361 --> 01:04.479
Oh, sure, I sit on the floor
for years, no one cares.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.031
The pretty white girl's
there ten seconds,

01:06.033 --> 01:08.400
and suddenly we're
all running to IKEA.

01:09.869 --> 01:11.319
No one is
running anywhere.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.238
We're not getting
a dining room table.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.956
I know you don't
like change,

01:14.958 --> 01:16.374
but it's not a terrible idea.

01:16.376 --> 01:18.159
Yeah, you guys never use
that space up there.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.311
Why not get a table?

01:19.313 --> 01:21.229
Do you want the long answer
or the short answer?

01:21.231 --> 01:23.781
Hey, how come <i>we</i> never
get that option?

01:24.967 --> 01:28.086
Chaos theory suggests that
even in a deterministic system,

01:28.088 --> 01:31.139
if the equations describing
its behavior are nonlinear,

01:31.141 --> 01:33.642
a tiny change
in the initial conditions

01:33.644 --> 01:37.128
can lead to a cataclysmic
and unpredictable result.

01:37.130 --> 01:38.647
Translation?

01:38.649 --> 01:41.900

02:13.642 --> 02:16.393
Hey, Penny and I are gonna go
shop for a dining room table.

02:16.395 --> 02:17.728
You want to come with us?

02:17.730 --> 02:19.346
You know, I'd love to,

02:19.348 --> 02:21.031
but, um,
I'm too busy

02:21.033 --> 02:25.136
falling back in love
with Windows 98.

02:26.238 --> 02:28.372
Seriously? You haven't used
this desk in years.

02:28.374 --> 02:31.759
The second I want to get rid
of it, you're up here working?

02:31.761 --> 02:32.943
I can't talk right now--

02:32.945 --> 02:36.063
I have several thousand updates
to install.

02:36.065 --> 02:37.982
Are you really
gonna sit here all day?

02:37.984 --> 02:40.234
Think of me as Arthur Dent

02:40.236 --> 02:42.569
in <i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy,</i>

02:42.571 --> 02:45.906
lying in front of the bulldozers
to protect his home.

02:45.908 --> 02:47.258
If you'll recall,
the Vogon fleet

02:47.260 --> 02:49.326
blew up the Earth anyway.
It's a made-up story,

02:49.328 --> 02:53.047
Leonard-- I don't even know
why you're talking about it.

02:53.049 --> 02:54.598
I'm putting all this
stuff in storage.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.083
We don't need
any of it.

02:56.085 --> 02:57.935
You... How can you say that?

02:57.937 --> 03:01.105
You show me one thing
in here we can live without.

03:01.107 --> 03:03.357
Oh, hang on.

03:06.094 --> 03:08.362
Check your in-box.

03:09.931 --> 03:12.533
Wait. Is this
really worth it?

03:12.535 --> 03:14.301
We've lived together

03:14.303 --> 03:16.487
for years with nary an argument.

03:16.489 --> 03:17.905
Huh?

03:17.907 --> 03:19.740
But we start talking
about a table,

03:19.742 --> 03:22.376
and suddenly we're
at each other's throats.

03:23.128 --> 03:25.663
"Nary an argument"?

03:26.865 --> 03:29.083
"Nary"?!

03:29.085 --> 03:32.503
Well, that means "not
one," or "not any".

03:33.638 --> 03:36.173
Maybe instead of a table,
you should buy a dictionary.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.511
Well, I don't know
if I won that,

03:40.513 --> 03:42.897
but at least he's upset.

03:44.065 --> 03:45.599
Check it out.

03:47.970 --> 03:49.853
Magic wand TV remote!

03:49.855 --> 03:52.656
Yeah, I can
control all sorts of stuff.

03:52.658 --> 03:54.358
Did Bernadette
think it was cool?

03:54.360 --> 03:57.811
Not when I said "mute"
and pointed it at her face.

03:57.813 --> 03:59.480
Oh, uh, let me try.

03:59.482 --> 04:01.165
Uh...

04:01.167 --> 04:03.150
channelis changeroni!

04:04.820 --> 04:08.422
This might be my second
favorite brown magic wand.

04:12.761 --> 04:16.863
Well, that's the last
time I play with <i>that.</i>

04:19.468 --> 04:21.368
I have to take this.

04:21.370 --> 04:23.137
Hello?

04:23.139 --> 04:24.138
Uh...

04:24.140 --> 04:25.839
off.

04:25.841 --> 04:27.558
And on.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.376
And the Oprah Network.

04:29.378 --> 04:34.315
This is so much better than
watching TV like a muggle.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.283
Okay. Thank you.

04:36.285 --> 04:38.185
We'll be in touch.

04:39.989 --> 04:42.189
You're not gonna
believe this.

04:42.191 --> 04:43.958
What's going on?

04:43.960 --> 04:46.710
Oh. Wait.

04:46.712 --> 04:48.512
On!

04:48.514 --> 04:50.998
And off!

04:51.000 --> 04:53.133
What's going on?

04:55.971 --> 04:58.038
That was NASA.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.009
They want me to go
back up to the space station.

05:02.011 --> 05:04.561
Wow. What did
you tell them?

05:04.563 --> 05:06.230
I told them
I'd be honored.

05:06.232 --> 05:09.566
A second trip to space--
I'll miss you.

05:09.568 --> 05:11.585
And I'm gonna
miss you, too.

05:11.587 --> 05:13.037
I just want you
to know, I'm happy

05:13.039 --> 05:14.505
to look in on Bernadette
while you're gone.

05:14.507 --> 05:16.140
Thank you.
And if anything were to happen

05:16.142 --> 05:19.226
to you, we will name
our firstborn son Howard.

05:20.228 --> 05:22.162
I'm just kidding.

05:22.164 --> 05:24.498
We'll name him Dalib,
after my grandfather.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.003
Ooh, this one looks nice.

05:29.005 --> 05:30.504
No. Sheldon doesn't like

05:30.506 --> 05:33.123
reclaimed wood.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.408
Why not?

05:34.410 --> 05:38.095
He's afraid the original owners
will come back.

05:38.097 --> 05:40.848
Yeah. Well, Sheldon's not here.

05:40.850 --> 05:42.766
Well, he is <i>here.</i>

05:42.768 --> 05:44.418
So unless you want
to dig him out

05:44.420 --> 05:45.969
with a bone saw
and a melon baller,

05:45.971 --> 05:47.855
there's nothing
I can do about it.

05:47.857 --> 05:49.773
All right, sweetie,
you're paying for this table,

05:49.775 --> 05:52.259
and it's your apartment, too.
I know, but...

05:52.261 --> 05:55.596
No buts. You got to stop
letting him boss you around.

05:55.598 --> 05:58.949
You're right. I mean, h-he
decides what TV shows we watch,

05:58.951 --> 06:01.402
what food we eat,
who my favorite hobbit is--

06:01.404 --> 06:03.770
I wanted Frodo, but we
can't <i>both</i> have Frodo,

06:03.772 --> 06:06.957
so guess who's stuck
with Samwise Gamgee.

06:06.959 --> 06:09.043
See? Right there.
You're a grown man,

06:09.045 --> 06:11.945
you should be able to pick
whichever hobbit you want.

06:13.281 --> 06:16.417
Wish you wouldn't, but
one problem at a time.

06:16.419 --> 06:20.054
Y-You make a lot of sense.

06:20.056 --> 06:22.956
I like this table,
and I'm getting it.

06:22.958 --> 06:25.225
Really? This one?

06:27.011 --> 06:28.545
That one?

06:28.547 --> 06:30.264
Damn right
I like that one.

06:34.487 --> 06:36.437
Hey.
Good news.

06:36.439 --> 06:40.324
Someone in this room
gets to take a ride on a rocket.

06:40.326 --> 06:43.560
Fine. Can I at least
shower first?

06:43.562 --> 06:45.079
No, not that.

06:45.081 --> 06:47.614
Although you already agreed
to it, so no take-backs.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.216
What are you
talking about?

06:49.218 --> 06:51.218
Sit down.

06:51.220 --> 06:53.370
NASA called.

06:53.372 --> 06:56.823
The telescope mount I
installed on the space station

06:56.825 --> 06:58.459
got damaged,

06:58.461 --> 07:01.245
and they want me to go
back up and fix it.

07:02.163 --> 07:03.547
Wow.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.716
Well, what did you say?

07:05.718 --> 07:08.435
What do you think
I...? I said yes!

07:08.437 --> 07:09.586
Why do you look
surprised?

07:09.588 --> 07:11.271
Well, it's just,
after last time,

07:11.273 --> 07:13.340
I didn't think you'd
ever want to go back.

07:13.342 --> 07:14.391
Are you kidding?

07:14.393 --> 07:16.510
It was the greatest
experience of my life.

07:16.512 --> 07:19.730
Really? 'Cause I kind of
remember a lot of complaining

07:19.732 --> 07:22.116
and wishing for it
to be over.

07:22.118 --> 07:24.184
I think you have
me confused

07:24.186 --> 07:27.354
with what's gonna happen when
you get out of that shower.

07:31.376 --> 07:34.161
Hey, all set.
What do you think?

07:34.163 --> 07:35.562
There's plenty of room
for everybody,

07:35.564 --> 07:36.797
a view out the window.

07:36.799 --> 07:39.216
My spot on the couch has
a great view of a window.

07:39.218 --> 07:40.534
Sometimes I can see

07:40.536 --> 07:41.935
space battles through it.

07:41.937 --> 07:43.504
It's called a TV.

07:44.906 --> 07:47.975
Give it a chance, Sheldon;
you might actually like it.

07:48.876 --> 07:50.677
You're absolutely right.

07:52.814 --> 07:54.214
Nope.

07:56.401 --> 07:59.386
Well, you can't say he
didn't give it a fair shot.

07:59.388 --> 08:00.721
So,
when can we get rid of it?

08:01.223 --> 08:02.189
We're not.

08:02.191 --> 08:04.158
What about
the roommate agreement?

08:04.160 --> 08:05.409
It specifically
states

08:05.411 --> 08:06.910
that any changes in furnishing

08:06.912 --> 08:09.279
have to be approved
by the Furnishing Committee.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.582
Which only sits
on alternate years.

08:11.584 --> 08:13.066
Yeah, and
by the way,

08:13.068 --> 08:14.901
it sits over there.

08:14.903 --> 08:16.703
Come on,
that is ridiculous.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.539
She's right--
a committee that important

08:18.541 --> 08:20.741
should meet more often.

08:20.743 --> 08:22.142
That's not what I'm saying.

08:22.144 --> 08:24.845
Oh. This is the thing
about me standing up to him

08:24.847 --> 08:26.580
and not letting him
run my life?

08:26.582 --> 08:27.798
Yes.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.550
That.

08:29.552 --> 08:32.686
Okay. I think we've
found the problem here.

08:32.688 --> 08:34.587
It's not the table at all.

08:34.590 --> 08:36.006
It's you.

08:36.008 --> 08:37.256
Me?

08:37.259 --> 08:39.592
Well, it's always me--
take one for the team.

08:39.595 --> 08:41.328
I have
spent years

08:41.330 --> 08:43.614
turning this lump of clay
into an acceptable conduit

08:43.616 --> 08:45.082
for my will,

08:45.084 --> 08:47.568
and then you came along
and reshaped him,

08:47.570 --> 08:50.988
with your newfangled ideas
and your fancy genitals.

08:50.990 --> 08:54.208
Are you gonna let him
talk to me like this?

08:54.210 --> 08:56.493
"Fancy" sounds
like a compliment.

08:56.495 --> 08:58.829
Okay, I have not tried
to change Leonard.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.581
That's just what happens
in relationships.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.633
Look how much
Amy's changed you.

09:02.635 --> 09:04.518
That's not true.
Oh, please.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.553
When I first met you,
you were incapable

09:06.555 --> 09:08.088
of touching another human being.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.840
Now you're holding
hands, you're going

09:09.842 --> 09:12.759
on dates, you even
made out with her on a train.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.645
She told you?!

09:14.647 --> 09:16.680
Of course she told me-- it's
the most interesting thing

09:16.682 --> 09:18.815
that's ever happened to
her in her entire life!

09:19.800 --> 09:21.151
You're too close to it,

09:21.153 --> 09:23.803
but Amy has had
a huge impact on you.

09:24.656 --> 09:26.173
You're right.

09:26.175 --> 09:28.992
Without realizing it,
I've allowed that woman

09:28.994 --> 09:30.978
to alter my personality.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.979
Mm, Sheldon, you didn't
have a personality;

09:32.981 --> 09:36.984
you just had some shows
you liked.

09:36.986 --> 09:38.552
No.

09:38.554 --> 09:40.254
No, I've changed.

09:40.256 --> 09:42.873
Like the frog who's put
in a pot of water

09:42.875 --> 09:44.491
that's heated so gradually

09:44.493 --> 09:46.043
he doesn't realize
he's boiling to death.

09:46.045 --> 09:48.662
Or you're the frog who's
been kissed by a princess

09:48.664 --> 09:50.264
and turned into
a prince.

09:50.266 --> 09:53.133
Or you're just
a tall, annoying frog.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.718
Excuse me.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.371
I have to break up
with my girlfriend.

09:57.373 --> 09:59.189
Oh, Sheldon, wait.
No.

09:59.191 --> 10:01.608
You've opened my eyes
to the truth.

10:01.610 --> 10:04.344
Amy has made me
a more affectionate,

10:04.346 --> 10:06.113
open-minded person.

10:06.115 --> 10:08.448
And that stops now.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.187
Well, we should call her.
Yeah, mm-hmm.

10:15.708 --> 10:17.207
Amy, it's Penny. Hey.

10:17.209 --> 10:18.575
Just a little heads-up.

10:18.577 --> 10:21.211
Leonard bought a
dining room table.

10:21.213 --> 10:23.630
Yeah. Sheldon's
breaking up with you.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:32.179 --> 10:35.365
Amy? Amy?

10:35.367 --> 10:36.983
Amy?

10:36.985 --> 10:39.018
I'll get right
to the point.

10:39.020 --> 10:40.286
I think we need

10:40.288 --> 10:42.605
to end this
relationship-- so...

10:42.607 --> 10:43.873
just sign this

10:43.875 --> 10:45.308
with your finger, and, uh,

10:45.310 --> 10:47.360
please don't cry on my iPad--

10:47.362 --> 10:49.746
I didn't get AppleCare.

10:49.748 --> 10:52.632
I'm not surprised you want
to end the relationship.

10:52.634 --> 10:55.802
I'm a little surprised
you didn't get AppleCare.

10:57.037 --> 10:59.455
Anyway, enjoy your life.
Where do I sign?

10:59.457 --> 11:00.924
At the bottom.
I must say,

11:00.926 --> 11:03.409
I'm relieved you're not making
more of a scene out of this.

11:03.411 --> 11:05.311
Oh, I've already moved on.

11:05.313 --> 11:07.497
Besides, this breakup has
nothing to do with me.

11:07.499 --> 11:09.515
Wh... It doesn't?

11:09.517 --> 11:11.434
Of course not.
This is just Leonard

11:11.436 --> 11:14.270
trying to take the focus
off that dreadful table

11:14.272 --> 11:16.055
by sowing discord
in our relationship.

11:16.057 --> 11:18.608
He's manipulating you
like he always does.

11:18.610 --> 11:21.661
Wait-wait, now, hang on.

11:21.663 --> 11:24.030
You think he manipulates me?

11:24.032 --> 11:25.315
All the time.

11:25.317 --> 11:26.916
And he knew that,

11:26.918 --> 11:29.235
as your girlfriend,
I wasn't gonna stand by

11:29.237 --> 11:31.921
and let him bring a table
into your apartment.

11:31.923 --> 11:34.340
I mean, a table?
Come on!

11:35.793 --> 11:39.262
It is hideous.

11:39.264 --> 11:40.763
Well, thankfully,
I won't have to see it,

11:40.765 --> 11:42.405
'cause I won't be your
girlfriend anymore.

11:43.884 --> 11:45.351
Amy Farrah Fowler.

11:45.353 --> 11:48.638
Why, yes, I <i>would</i> like
to take a survey.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.356
Wait.

11:51.558 --> 11:53.059
You were really
gonna stand by me

11:53.061 --> 11:54.477
against the dining room table?

11:55.396 --> 11:57.613
Of course I was.

11:57.615 --> 11:59.265
Yeah, wait.

11:59.267 --> 12:03.136
How do I know that <i>you're</i>
not manipulating me right now?

12:03.138 --> 12:05.938
I think if I were
manipulating you,

12:05.940 --> 12:08.992
you'd be smart
enough to see it.

12:08.994 --> 12:11.127
How do I know
you're not saying <i>that</i>

12:11.129 --> 12:13.830
as part of the manipulation?

12:13.832 --> 12:17.333
I think you'd be smart
enough to see that, too.

12:18.702 --> 12:20.169
Okay.

12:21.455 --> 12:24.924
I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time--
I just had to be sure.

12:27.411 --> 12:28.628
It's pretty exciting

12:28.630 --> 12:30.963
that NASA wants
to send Howard back up.

12:30.965 --> 12:32.899
Yeah, exciting.

12:32.901 --> 12:35.018
Can I ask you something?

12:35.020 --> 12:36.269
Course.

12:36.271 --> 12:38.104
He hated that
entire experience.

12:38.106 --> 12:39.689
Does it make me
an awful wife

12:39.691 --> 12:41.824
if I don't think he
should do it again?

12:41.826 --> 12:42.975
Not at all.

12:42.977 --> 12:44.911
He's forgotten
how miserable he was

12:44.913 --> 12:46.662
the entire time he was up there.

12:46.664 --> 12:48.247
It's like me

12:48.249 --> 12:50.566
in those moments
when I miss India.

12:50.568 --> 12:52.418
So you'll talk to him?

12:52.420 --> 12:53.423
Why me?

12:53.448 --> 12:55.586
Well, I'm his wife;
I don't want to ruin it for him.

12:55.623 --> 12:58.758
That's the dynamic-- I'm the
fun one, you're the buzzkill.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.960
Since when am I the buzzkill?

13:00.962 --> 13:02.712
Do you think this is cool?

13:02.714 --> 13:04.547
No, I think it's stupid.
Aha!

13:06.483 --> 13:08.818
You're right, it's great.

13:13.024 --> 13:14.540
Hello.
Oh, hey.

13:14.542 --> 13:16.159
You guys didn't break up.

13:16.161 --> 13:18.277
No. Sorry to disappoint you,

13:18.279 --> 13:20.029
but Amy pointed out that

13:20.031 --> 13:21.981
you we only trying
to manipulate me.

13:21.983 --> 13:23.232
Which you also
figured out by yourself.

13:23.234 --> 13:25.684
Which I also
figured out by myself.

13:26.570 --> 13:28.704
Well, I'm glad
you're still together.

13:28.706 --> 13:30.189
Yeah, okay,
you can stop trying

13:30.191 --> 13:31.574
to make this about
our relationship.

13:31.576 --> 13:34.460
Which is stronger than ever.
Which is stronger than ever.

13:35.195 --> 13:36.329
This is about <i>you</i>

13:36.331 --> 13:38.047
trying to change
my environment,

13:38.049 --> 13:40.133
which was perfect
the way it was.

13:40.135 --> 13:42.802
But it got the way it was
through change.

13:42.804 --> 13:44.670
The-the spot
that you love to sit in,

13:44.672 --> 13:47.974
that no one else can sit in,
only exists because--

13:47.976 --> 13:51.177
despite your objections--
I bought this couch.

13:51.179 --> 13:52.311
Me.

13:52.313 --> 13:54.313
So explain
why that change was bad

13:54.315 --> 13:56.182
and this change was good.

13:57.985 --> 13:59.852
Um...

13:59.854 --> 14:02.188
You don't need to
explain yourself to him.

14:02.190 --> 14:05.324
I don't need to explain
myself to you!

14:05.326 --> 14:08.027
You're sick of his nonsense
and ready to move in with me.

14:08.029 --> 14:10.113
Keep the table!
We don't use that space!

14:16.069 --> 14:18.287
Damn it, I got cocky.

14:20.674 --> 14:23.359
Hey, Bernie.
I'm home... Hello.

14:23.361 --> 14:24.743
Hi, honey.

14:24.745 --> 14:26.078
What's going on?

14:26.080 --> 14:28.331
Maybe you should
have a seat.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.249
Um... okay.

14:30.251 --> 14:33.302
I know my mom's not dead;
there'd be balloons.

14:34.388 --> 14:35.921
Um... okay. First off,

14:35.923 --> 14:39.142
know that we all love you
and cherish you.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.494
Well, I wouldn't...
Daddy.

14:41.496 --> 14:43.980
You're great.

14:44.948 --> 14:48.117
Can I say something?
Oh, of course.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.787
Hey, Fruit Loops.

14:51.789 --> 14:54.490
Massimino?
Why are <i>you</i> here?

14:54.492 --> 14:55.725
Well, I heard you were thinking

14:55.727 --> 14:57.460
about going back up
to the space station,

14:57.462 --> 14:59.629
and as someone
who's been there with you...

14:59.631 --> 15:02.498
well, you know how astronauts
need to have the "right stuff"?

15:02.500 --> 15:03.583
Sure.

15:03.585 --> 15:06.085
The stuff you have is wrong.

15:09.072 --> 15:12.108
You don't think
I did a good job up there?

15:12.110 --> 15:13.559
You did a fine job.

15:13.561 --> 15:16.412
It's just, you were scared
and miserable the whole time.

15:16.414 --> 15:17.713
I think what

15:17.715 --> 15:19.899
we're all trying to say
is, you don't seem

15:19.901 --> 15:22.552
to be remembering how traumatic
the experience was for you.

15:22.554 --> 15:25.905
Like how women often forget
the pain of childbirth.

15:25.907 --> 15:28.641
Like a woman.
Great analogy.

15:29.443 --> 15:32.445
Fine, maybe I was
a little scared.

15:32.447 --> 15:35.031
You peed in your space suit.

15:35.033 --> 15:36.766
You're supposed to do that.

15:36.768 --> 15:38.935
Not during the fitting.

15:40.070 --> 15:43.172
Son, do I need to remind you
what you asked me to do

15:43.174 --> 15:44.840
before you went
up last time?

15:44.842 --> 15:48.010
Hang on. That was
just me joking around.

15:48.012 --> 15:51.080
You wanted me to shoot you
in the foot.

15:51.082 --> 15:54.350
Come on, how is that not a joke?
"You got to get me out of this.

15:54.352 --> 15:56.385
Shoot me in the foot."

15:57.804 --> 16:00.590
Don't forget all the other
astronauts picking on you.

16:00.592 --> 16:02.391
And how you threw up
in zero gravity,

16:02.393 --> 16:04.610
and it floated
back in your mouth.

16:05.512 --> 16:06.896
And you threw up again.

16:06.898 --> 16:08.664
And so on and so on.

16:11.001 --> 16:13.035
That was funny.

16:13.037 --> 16:14.186
Okay, so I wasn't

16:14.188 --> 16:17.123
exactly John Glenn up there,

16:17.125 --> 16:19.825
but I've changed;
I'm a different man now.

16:19.827 --> 16:21.193
Yeah, and I'm
a little

16:21.195 --> 16:24.580
insulted that you guys
don't think I can handle it.

16:24.582 --> 16:27.216
You know you're gonna have to go
through survival training again.

16:27.218 --> 16:28.534
Really?

16:28.536 --> 16:30.920
You've got to get me
out of this!

16:30.922 --> 16:33.422
What do you want me to do?
You're perfectly healthy.

16:33.424 --> 16:35.224
Check my blood pressure again!

16:35.226 --> 16:38.728
I can get it higher;
just give me a second.

16:39.763 --> 16:42.381
Hello?
Hi, Ma. How are you?

16:43.216 --> 16:44.717
How I am is not dead!

16:44.719 --> 16:47.403
But you wouldn't know that,
because you don't love me enough

16:47.405 --> 16:48.738
to pick up the phone!

16:48.740 --> 16:51.223
Go, go, go!

16:51.225 --> 16:55.027
For all you know, I could have
slipped in the tub and drowned!

16:55.029 --> 16:57.563
That's what happened
to your Aunt Ida!

16:58.415 --> 17:00.232
Wow.

17:09.290 --> 17:11.925
Howard, I'm so sorry your
blood pressure was off the charts.

17:11.926 --> 17:14.426
Oh, me, too.
I mean, the doctor was willing

17:14.429 --> 17:16.128
to fudge the results, but...

17:16.131 --> 17:19.065
it just seemed
so darned dishonest.

17:21.519 --> 17:23.569
But the mission wouldn't be
for at least a year.

17:23.571 --> 17:25.605
Isn't that enough time to get
your blood pressure under...

17:25.607 --> 17:28.191
Look, my blood pressure's
too high, okay? Drop it.

17:29.176 --> 17:30.510
You know, my aunt

17:30.512 --> 17:32.329
changed her diet,
and in a few months, she...

17:32.331 --> 17:33.480
Went to space?

17:33.482 --> 17:35.282
I don't think so.
Now, pass the soy sauce.

17:35.284 --> 17:37.150
Hey, not the green one;
the red one.

17:38.119 --> 17:41.187
Sheldon, Amy, will you
please come join us?

17:41.189 --> 17:42.973
Yeah, it's
fun up here.

17:42.975 --> 17:45.392
So why are you
trying to ruin it?

17:45.394 --> 17:47.410
No, thanks.

17:47.412 --> 17:49.429
We're fine.
I mean, if you people

17:49.431 --> 17:52.766
want to eat at the table,
then that's what you should do.

17:52.768 --> 17:54.284
I like eating down here

17:54.286 --> 17:56.753
because this is how
we've always done things.

17:56.755 --> 17:59.139
But if those days are
gone, they're gone.

17:59.141 --> 18:02.359
It just...
makes me sad.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.328
Now I feel bad.

18:05.330 --> 18:07.781
Oh, don't anthropomorphize him;
he's got big eyes,

18:07.783 --> 18:11.484
but his feelings
are not like ours.

18:12.570 --> 18:15.755
No, it just seems silly
for us to sit in two groups.

18:15.757 --> 18:17.791
Well, it's not silly
if you think of that group

18:17.793 --> 18:20.377
as being led
by a big, evil baby.

18:24.882 --> 18:26.966
Look at Amy
down there.

18:26.968 --> 18:29.019
Should we go?

18:29.021 --> 18:30.737
Yeah, let's go.

18:30.739 --> 18:32.972
But... Penny,
this was your idea.

18:32.974 --> 18:34.774
You said that I should
stand up to him.

18:34.776 --> 18:36.059
Forget it, Leonard.

18:36.061 --> 18:37.894
It's over.

18:38.763 --> 18:40.213
Fine.

18:45.719 --> 18:47.187
Rajesh?

18:47.189 --> 18:50.156
Screw that! I sat
on the floor for seven years.

18:50.158 --> 18:52.308
I'm staying right here!

18:52.310 --> 18:55.195
Come on, Raj, it's
not the same without you.

18:56.398 --> 18:58.865
Fine.

18:58.867 --> 19:01.901
But no more making fun
of how I say tings.

19:01.903 --> 19:05.372
You mean "tings"
like "moo-stache"?

19:11.128 --> 19:13.746
Well, isn't this nice.

19:15.387 --> 19:16.945
Sometimes the baby wins.
