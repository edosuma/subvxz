best expresses the aloha spirit

Will people who are late to class
be allowed to participate?

we should be tolerant of others.

I'll be good. I mean it.

I hope so. If there's any more trouble,
you won't be allowed in the competition.

Yeah, interesting question.

- Toast?

29:02.449 --> 29:04.408
Making toast. We're making toast.

You came here and interrupted me

31:40.523 --> 31:42.608
LILO: This is how the story goes, Stitch.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.779
Once, there was a beautiful
goddess named Hi'iaka

31:47.864 --> 31:50.657
and a handsome mortal
named Lohi'au.

31:52.285 --> 31:55.412
They were as close
as two people could be.

31:57.081 --> 31:58.081
Oops!

31:59.417 --> 32:03.253
But one day, Pele,
the volcano goddess,

32:03.296 --> 32:05.631
grew jealous of their friendship.

32:07.926 --> 32:14.848
So she took Lohi'au and threw him
into a volcano filled with molten lava.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.643
- Waagh!
- Oh... Stitch!

32:17.936 --> 32:19.269
My bad.

32:25.026 --> 32:29.613
Hi'iaka discovered his body
in a cavern by a sea cliff,

32:29.697 --> 32:31.448
and she stayed with him,

32:31.616 --> 32:35.202
praying to the gods
to bring Lohi'au's spirit back.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.498
And it worked.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.750
Her love brought him back to life,

32:42.001 --> 32:46.463
proving that love
is more powerful than death.

and Mertle laughs at me?

And I get mad and pound her?

You gotta help me, Stitch. I need you.

That's Stitch.

33:48.609 --> 33:52.821

- You don't mean that.
