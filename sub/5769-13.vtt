ANNOUNCER:
Previously on AMC's
Darkness at Noon...

00:05.600 --> 00:06.692
(siren wailing)

00:06.740 --> 00:08.696
You crossed the line.

00:08.740 --> 00:10.662
I am not going back.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.234
There are lines.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.804
And then
there are lines.

00:13.840 --> 00:14.499
(grunts)

00:14.540 --> 00:16.144
Do you know what needs doing?

00:16.180 --> 00:17.704
I'll tell you what needs doing.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.638
You make your own lines.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.546
* Me and the devil

00:24.590 --> 00:26.251
What's going on?

00:26.290 --> 00:28.258
He shot the other guy.

00:28.290 --> 00:29.826
Now they're blaming
the bald guy.

00:29.860 --> 00:32.397
Now she's in trouble.
(doorbell rings)

00:32.430 --> 00:33.727
I got it.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.193
* Me and the devil.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.758
Hello.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.734
Hello.

00:39.770 --> 00:42.409
Is your mother home?

00:42.440 --> 00:44.806
Uh, Mom?
Oh, it's by the door!

00:44.840 --> 00:48.207
Tell him the piping
on the jacket is leather!
Uh,

00:48.240 --> 00:51.277
the piping
on the jacket's leather.

00:51.310 --> 00:52.709
When do you want it back?

00:52.750 --> 00:54.172
When do you want it back?

00:54.220 --> 00:56.085
ALICIA:
Thursday.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.212
Good.

00:57.250 --> 01:00.583
And could you also tell her, uh,
Charles Lester is here?

01:00.620 --> 01:04.329
Uh, Charles Lester is here.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.328
(gunshot on TV)

01:06.360 --> 01:08.157
What?
Grace, go to your room

01:08.200 --> 01:09.292
for a minute.
I'll be right there.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.297
Why? Who is that?
Grace,

01:10.330 --> 01:11.558
please.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.136
Ow.

01:13.170 --> 01:14.797
Uh, Zach, go to your room
for a minute.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.104
I'm working in the kitchen.
Bring your work
in your room.

01:17.140 --> 01:18.300
Nice to meet you, Zach.

01:18.340 --> 01:21.309
You, too.
Nice boy.

01:21.340 --> 01:22.841
So, now,
did you want

01:22.880 --> 01:24.848
starch with any of these?
Ha-ha.

01:24.880 --> 01:28.839
What are you doing here,
Mr. Lester, at my home?

01:28.880 --> 01:29.847
Oh, we have a problem.
Then call me.

01:29.890 --> 01:33.155
No. This is not something
for the telephone.

01:33.190 --> 01:34.487
May I, uh...
Can we do this

01:34.520 --> 01:37.523
ltomorrow?
Im sorry, no.

01:41.760 --> 01:45.560
Wow, what a beautiful apartment.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.559
You know, I have no eye at
all, but this is beautiful.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.305
Thank you.
What's the problem?

01:51.340 --> 01:53.331
I have it right here.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.708
Just tell me.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.913
No, no. 1-1 have
it written down.

02:00.950 --> 02:03.282
I probably should get

02:03.320 --> 02:04.787
a smart phone. My wife

02:04.820 --> 02:07.914
says that's the only
way to... Mm.

02:07.960 --> 02:11.157
Uh, the bond hearing is
at 10:30 tomorrow morning.

02:11.190 --> 02:14.227
Uh, Mr. Bishop is at the, um,

02:14.260 --> 02:17.388
Pike Street station.
Is that a "P"?

02:17.430 --> 02:18.897
Lake Street station.
Oh.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.136
Drug arrest?

02:21.870 --> 02:24.430
Why do you ask that?
Why do I ask

02:24.470 --> 02:27.177
if it's a drug arrest?
Because it's Lemond Bishop.
Well, he has

02:27.210 --> 02:28.871
legitimate businesses also.

02:28.910 --> 02:30.741
_ Is _this about_
hIS legitimate busmess?

02:30.780 --> 02:32.247
Not really.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.679
Then what are we talking about?

02:44.360 --> 02:46.328
ZACH:
'"Mr. Bishop had nothing to do
with these murders,‘

02:46.360 --> 02:47.588
"said family spokesman
and lawyer

02:47.630 --> 02:49.393
Charles Lester."

02:49.430 --> 02:52.194
Maybe it's a different
Charles Lester.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.332
He's just the spokesman.

02:53.370 --> 02:55.361
It's not like he
actually did it.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.501
"An ex-Bishop captain,

02:59.540 --> 03:01.872
"who spoke off the record, said,

03:01.910 --> 03:04.401
'"Stay out of Charles Lester's
way and whatever you do,

03:04.450 --> 03:05.906
don't give him your name.'"

03:08.320 --> 03:09.947
ELI:
I read your investigative
report, Marilyn.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.787
All two pages of it.

03:11.820 --> 03:12.889
I told you, Eli,

03:12.920 --> 03:15.252
I could only report
on what I could clearly confirm.

03:15.290 --> 03:16.951
You're hurting Peter
with these games.

03:16.990 --> 03:19.299
This is not a game, Eli.
You stonewalled me.

03:19.330 --> 03:20.888
I can't write a report...

03:20.930 --> 03:22.568
Peter needs you to clear him.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.818
Jim Moody acted alone.
That's what you heard.

03:24.870 --> 03:27.691
Peter never saw this tape
until you showed it to him.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.958
We'd like to see an amended
report by tomorrow night.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.830
This is not just...
(line clicks)

03:31.870 --> 03:33.770
(sighs)

03:33.810 --> 03:37.268
(tires screech)

03:39.650 --> 03:41.618
Hello, Ms. Garbanza.

03:41.650 --> 03:44.380
I'm Nelson Dubeck with the
Office of Public Integrity.

03:44.420 --> 03:46.411
Would you mind joining
us for a second?

03:53.530 --> 03:57.318
Did you see who's...
Yep. They still represent
Bishop's legitimate businesses.

03:57.370 --> 03:58.997
We can't get away from them.
We see them more now.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.339
(chuckles)
We have to stop
sharing clients.

04:01.370 --> 04:03.668
BAILIFF:
All rise.
(sighs)

04:03.710 --> 04:05.735
Uh-oh.
What?

04:05.770 --> 04:09.035
ALICIA:
Judge Kluger.
I have a lunch with him.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.877
Okay, we have a...

04:10.910 --> 04:13.811
probable cause
hearing. Mr. Bishop,

04:13.850 --> 04:15.272
we've seen you in here before.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.480
Your Honor.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.442
And Mrs. Florrick
and Mr. Gardner,

04:18.490 --> 04:20.515
Ms. Lockhart...

04:20.560 --> 04:22.289
and, um...
Mr. Agos.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.922
Mr. Agos. I'm sorry.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.827
We have a full cast of
characters. Like a clown car.

04:26.860 --> 04:28.396
And, you, sir,

04:28.430 --> 04:29.567
uh, you're a new lavwer here?

04:29.600 --> 04:31.022
Charles Lester, Your Honor.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.833
You step in if one of them dies?

04:32.870 --> 04:34.337
Let's hope that won't happen.

04:34.370 --> 04:35.860
No, I'm just, uh,

04:35.900 --> 04:38.039
Mr. Bishop's
personal attorney.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.901
And the federal government.

04:39.940 --> 04:44.343
You have no one to hold hands
with over there, Mr. Asher?

04:44.380 --> 04:47.042
I hold hands with justice,
Your Honor.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.071
I see. How does justice feel
about that?

04:49.120 --> 04:51.611
It was a joke, Your Honor.

04:51.650 --> 04:53.015
Oh, a joke. I see.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.552
Well, I'm gonna have
to watch out for you, you wag.

04:56.590 --> 04:58.057
Let's dig in. What do you got?

04:58.090 --> 04:59.990
Uh, Your Honor,
it'll only take a few minutes

05:00.030 --> 05:03.067
to establish probable cause
in this case, as the evidence is

05:03.100 --> 05:04.988
overwhelming.
Really? Mrs. Florrick.

05:05.030 --> 05:07.692
Your Honor, according
to the DEA's

05:07.740 --> 05:10.800
own search warrant, it stemmed
from a single eyewitness.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.478
And I imagine you'd like to hear
from that witness.

05:12.510 --> 05:14.034
We definitely would,
Your Honor.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.378
You have to jump on it.
They want to impress Bishop,

05:16.410 --> 05:18.708
win back all his business.
ASHER:
Ms. Moretti,

05:18.750 --> 05:21.014
what were you
doing at 4: 10

05:21.050 --> 05:22.688
in the afternoon
on February 26?

05:22.720 --> 05:23.880
I was in a condominium unit

05:23.920 --> 05:26.559
across from
the Bruckman Building.
The Bruckman Building

05:26.590 --> 05:29.354
is a residence owned
by the defendant, right?
Yes.

05:29.390 --> 05:30.652
I sold it to him.

05:30.690 --> 05:32.794
And what did you see
from the window?
Well, I was getting ready

05:32.830 --> 05:33.751
to show another unit

05:33.800 --> 05:36.360
when I saw three
African-American individuals

05:36.400 --> 05:37.822
getting out of a black SUV.

05:37.870 --> 05:41.362
Was the defendant
among them?
He was. He was standing watch

05:41.400 --> 05:43.903
in the alley while the other
two were carrying duffle bags

05:43.940 --> 05:46.067
into the back entrance.

05:46.110 --> 05:48.408
I saw one
of the bags zipped open,

05:48.440 --> 05:50.408
and there were white
packets in5ide.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.418
Like bricks.
How far away was she?

05:52.450 --> 05:54.077
Cary's questioning.
And these bricks,

05:54.120 --> 05:57.578
did they look like drugs to you?
CARY: Objection.
Calls for a conclusion.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.679
KLUGER:
It sure does.
I will sustain that.

06:02.090 --> 06:04.923
Howard Lyman, please. It's Will.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.929
DUBECK:
Are you comfortable?

06:07.960 --> 06:09.154
Reasonably.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.122
You scared me to death.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.991
Sorry. The black van tends
to intimidate.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.134
We need your help, Ms. Garbanzo.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.934
"Ah." Ms. Garbanza.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.436
My apologies.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.846
We're looking
into your boss, ma'am.
You mean

06:23.880 --> 06:24.949
Eli Gold?

06:24.980 --> 06:26.413
No.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.083
Why?

06:30.120 --> 06:31.644
Voter fraud.

06:31.690 --> 06:33.681
I can't help you.
Yes, you can.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.655
Y-You'll think you can't because
of your loyalty to Peter...
You mean

06:36.690 --> 06:39.124
Governor Florrick_.
But you'll soon realize
you're vulnerable.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.856
Do you want
to know why?
No.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.868
You have no attorney-client
privilege.

06:43.900 --> 06:47.165
Everybody else is a lawyer.
The world is full of lawyers.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.168
You're the type
that goes to jail.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.667
For what?

06:50.710 --> 06:52.769
Conspiracy
to defraud the public.

06:52.810 --> 06:55.973
Please open the door.
But there's another reason
you'll talk to me, Marilyn.

06:56.010 --> 06:58.649
I said open the door.
Let me out.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.513
It's the right thing to do.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.851
What are you doing?

07:07.890 --> 07:09.187
LESTER:
Why?

07:09.220 --> 07:11.654
What's the matter?
Well, he's not the, um...

07:11.690 --> 07:12.918
brightest.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.224
WILL:
Mr. Lyman,
as a Lockhart/Gardner

07:15.260 --> 07:18.468
lawyer, were you assigned
a task on Mr. Bishop's case?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.092
Yes.
And could you

07:20.140 --> 07:21.198
tell us what that was?

07:21.240 --> 07:23.458
I could.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.902
What was it?

07:27.940 --> 07:30.909
I was to assess the property

07:30.950 --> 07:33.043
that Mr. Bishop
was gonna purchase.
And were you

07:33.080 --> 07:36.481
assessing properties
on February 26 at 4:00 p.m.?

07:36.520 --> 07:39.239
Yes. And a lot of other dates.
But on that date,
were you assessing

07:39.290 --> 07:43.181
a property
at 1677 South Oakley Avenue?

07:43.230 --> 07:46.552
Yes.
And is that anywhere near
the Bruckman Building

07:46.600 --> 07:48.818
where Ms. Moretti claims
she saw Lemond Bishop

07:48.860 --> 07:51.192
unloading white bricks?
No, it's, like,

07:51.230 --> 07:54.495
20 miles away.
And who showed you
these condos on South Oakley?

07:54.540 --> 07:57.236
Ms. Moretti.
Your Honor,

07:57.270 --> 07:58.908
the only proof
is this man's opinion?

07:58.940 --> 08:00.498
WILL:
Actually,
if I may continue,

08:00.540 --> 08:01.529
Your Honor.
Please.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.844
Now, Mr. Lyman, did you
happen to take photos

08:03.880 --> 08:05.575
of the condo
at South Oakley?

08:05.610 --> 08:07.146
Panoramic photos.

08:07.180 --> 08:08.875
And is this one of your photos?

08:08.920 --> 08:09.682
Yes, it is.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.517
And who is that there
in the corner?

08:11.550 --> 08:13.552
HOWARD:
That's Ms. Moretti.

08:13.590 --> 08:15.285
WILL:
We submit the camera
and the stamped photos

08:15.320 --> 08:17.686
as evidence, Your Honor.
KLUGER:
Okay.

08:17.730 --> 08:22.019
AUSA Asher, do you and justice
have anything to offer?

08:22.060 --> 08:25.029
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Uh, this is Agent Cheswick.

08:25.070 --> 08:27.163
He's not from Justice.
He's a DEA agent.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.067
I'm referring to your
holding hands with justice.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.578
I'm-I'm sorry, Your Honor?
Do you guys

08:32.610 --> 08:33.872
joke much over there at Justice?

08:33.910 --> 08:34.774
All the time.

08:34.810 --> 08:36.232
Good. Your friend

08:36.280 --> 08:37.941
from DEA,

08:37.980 --> 08:39.572
does he have anything to offer?

08:39.620 --> 08:41.576
Your Honor, I think I can
clear up a confusion here.

08:41.620 --> 08:44.214
I was just rushing over here
after interviewing Ms. Moretti.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.581
And she apologizes,

08:45.620 --> 08:46.518
but she made a mistake.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.255
She saw the defendant
transporting drugs

08:48.290 --> 08:50.952
a day earlier, on February 25.

08:50.990 --> 08:53.925
(clamoring)
(banging gavel)

08:53.960 --> 08:55.120
Have a seat.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.127
You were just rushing over here?

08:58.170 --> 09:00.058
You don't seem
very out of breath.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.761
I'm a good runner.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.030
Are you? Okay,
here's what I'm gonna do.

09:04.070 --> 09:06.265
(clears throat)
I'm gonna free

09:06.310 --> 09:08.835
Mr. Bishop.
Your Honor,
that's completely unacceptable.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.279
...walk away?
Wait, guys,
this isn't Crossfire.

09:10.310 --> 09:15.009
I'm gonna free Mr. Bishop
on $100,000 bond.

09:15.050 --> 09:16.642
I'm not dismissing
the charges.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.248
We're gonna go to trial.
But I'm gonna

09:18.290 --> 09:21.054
tell you something, guys:
you can't do this.

09:21.090 --> 09:23.684
You tell a story,
and you stick to it.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.790
(gavelbangs)
ALICIA:
I have a lunch

09:26.830 --> 09:27.797
with Judge Kluger tomorrow.

09:27.830 --> 09:29.798
I didn't know he was
on this case.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.798
I thought you said this lunch
was just about a book

09:31.830 --> 09:35.129
he's writing
about lavwers.
It is, but I...

09:35.170 --> 09:36.808
It doesn't feel...

09:36.840 --> 09:40.139
I think I should cancel.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.808
What?
You don't want to
piss off a judge,

09:42.850 --> 09:44.272
not one we're
argumg in front of.

09:44.310 --> 09:46.039
(elevator door slides open)

09:47.120 --> 09:51.580
Mrs. Florrick,
do you have a minute?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.278
There's no way the real estate
agent could've seen me

09:57.330 --> 10:00.026
moving any product
on February 25.

10:00.060 --> 10:01.721
Because you're innocent?
No.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.320
I was moving product
on February 26.

10:04.370 --> 10:07.339
So you're saying
they got their facts right,

10:07.370 --> 10:10.168
but the witness
couldn't have seen it.
Yes, she wasn't there.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.098
And she couldn't have seen it
on February 25

10:12.140 --> 10:13.368
because it wasn't happening.

10:13.410 --> 10:16.174
You think they don't want
to reveal the reason

10:16.210 --> 10:17.643
they knew about the drugs?

10:17.680 --> 10:18.374
Yes.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.049
A confidential informant?

10:22.080 --> 10:24.685
Didn't I tell you
she was smart? Yep,

10:24.720 --> 10:26.312
that's what we're considering.

10:26.350 --> 10:27.851
VVho?

10:27.890 --> 10:29.312
Well,

10:29.360 --> 10:33.194
when Mr. Bishop was
here last week, um,

10:33.230 --> 10:35.698
who was in
the meeting?

10:38.930 --> 10:40.397
(pen clicks)

10:41.400 --> 10:43.004
No.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.099
We've reviewed our memories,
Mrs. Florrick. We only

10:45.140 --> 10:48.769
mentioned Mr. Bishop's
February 26 location once,

10:48.810 --> 10:51.074
and that was in the meeting
with your firm.
No.

10:51.110 --> 10:53.317
It had to have been someone
else, someone from your crew.

10:53.350 --> 10:55.910
(chuckling):
No.

10:55.950 --> 10:59.408
Mr. Bishop kept his
location private.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.954
But he did share it with your
firm in case there was trouble.

11:02.990 --> 11:06.426
You were the only ones
who knew where he was.

11:06.460 --> 11:09.020
So...

11:09.060 --> 11:10.823
could you give me those names?

11:27.180 --> 11:28.841
BISHOP:
Actually,

11:28.880 --> 11:30.984
do you mind taking the stairs
and giving us a minute?

11:31.020 --> 11:33.056
Hi. I don't think we've met.

11:33.090 --> 11:34.887
Uh, Charles Lester.
Clarke

11:34.920 --> 11:36.217
Hayden.
Were you
in the meeting

11:36.260 --> 11:37.386
last week?

11:37.430 --> 11:38.829
Oh, Mr. Lester, can we talk?

11:38.860 --> 11:39.895
Definitely.
And, uh, you must be

11:39.930 --> 11:41.056
Robyn, right, the bubbly one?

11:41.100 --> 11:42.192
I don't know about that.

11:42.230 --> 11:43.891
And what was your last name?

11:43.930 --> 11:45.192
Uh, okay, we're gonna talk.

11:45.230 --> 11:47.061
Excuse me.

11:51.370 --> 11:53.930
I'll investigate.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.107
If there was a leak--

11:56.140 --> 11:58.973
and I very much doubt that there
was-- then I'm responsible.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.216
BISHOP:
Okay.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.512
That's good of you.

12:01.550 --> 12:04.110
But Charles will
work with you.

12:04.150 --> 12:05.913
Mr. Bishop, this is my firm.

12:05.950 --> 12:07.417
This is my life.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.782
If this goes wrong, you won't be
the one doing 15 in Pekin.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.048
I thought you liked
working with me, Alicia.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.868
Did I do something wrong?
No.

12:18.900 --> 12:22.165
Not at all, but after the
meeting, did you talk to anyone?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.100
After the Lemond
Bishop meeting? No.

12:24.140 --> 12:26.028
I mean, I did talk to people,
but not about the meeting.

12:26.070 --> 12:27.002
And did you take notes?

12:27.040 --> 12:28.177
Yes.

12:28.210 --> 12:29.336
Where are those?

12:29.380 --> 12:30.472
In my desk.

12:30.510 --> 12:32.171
I lock my desk.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.110
I am so sorry

12:34.150 --> 12:35.310
that I'm late.

12:35.350 --> 12:37.386
I couldn't find a cab,
and I hate to drive.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.445
Mr. Lester, we were
just finishing up.

12:39.490 --> 12:41.151
Really? Oh, darn.

12:41.190 --> 12:45.081
Well, maybe I can just
listen in on the end.

12:45.130 --> 12:46.483
Mr. Hayden.

12:46.530 --> 12:47.827
Hello, sir.

12:47.860 --> 12:49.020
You were just saying
that you didn't

12:49.060 --> 12:51.961
tell anyone about the facts
discussed in the Bishop meeting,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.094
and that you didn't
show anyone your notes.

12:55.140 --> 12:57.005
Actually, I didn't say
that... about the notes.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.008
You...?

12:59.040 --> 13:00.177
Are you sure?

13:00.210 --> 13:02.132
Yes.

13:02.180 --> 13:04.444
So, you showed
someone your notes.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.471
No, I locked them
in my desk.

13:06.510 --> 13:08.319
I just wanted
to be exact.

13:08.350 --> 13:10.215
I hadn't said it yet.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.241
Good. Thank you.

13:12.290 --> 13:17.080
So, just a few
questions from me.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.849
Mm-hmm.

13:19.900 --> 13:25.395
Did you do a cost-benefit
analysis of Mr. Bishop, sir?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.261
Of all the clients, yes. Why?

13:27.300 --> 13:28.836
Oh, I don't know.

13:28.870 --> 13:30.269
I'm just nosey.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.959
Who did you share

13:32.010 --> 13:33.136
this analysis with?

13:33.180 --> 13:35.034
Just the partners here.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.002
No one else?
No one else.
Now,

13:37.050 --> 13:39.075
you have a friend
from high school

13:39.110 --> 13:43.114
who works
for the Drug Enforcement Agency.

13:43.150 --> 13:44.981
Howie?

13:45.020 --> 13:47.181
Howard, yes, and

13:47.220 --> 13:49.188
I can't find his last name.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.380
I didn't leak anything.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.954
Well, that stands
to reason.

13:51.990 --> 13:54.254
When was the time you saw Howie?

13:54.300 --> 13:56.291
2002.

13:56.330 --> 13:58.594
LESTER:
And what about your father?

13:58.630 --> 14:00.188
When was the last time
you saw him?

14:00.240 --> 14:01.889
Mm, like a month ago.

14:01.940 --> 14:04.238
He reminds me of you, actually.

14:04.270 --> 14:06.101
A handsome devil, eh?

14:06.140 --> 14:07.903
(Robyn and Lester laugh)

14:07.940 --> 14:09.498
ROBYN:
He wanted to be a lawyer, but

14:09.540 --> 14:12.373
they were kind of
the turn on, drop out sorts.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.378
Did your dad have
a drug arrest?

14:14.420 --> 14:16.047
Oh, yeah,
more than one.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.514
He grew pot in our baclqard
for a while.
So, that's

14:18.550 --> 14:22.213
odd, you becoming
an investigator for Treasury?

14:22.260 --> 14:24.182
Ah, I needed a job.
Student loans.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.084
And you had lunch
with a friend

14:26.130 --> 14:27.256
from Treasury just last week.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.167
Yeah. How'd you know that?

14:30.200 --> 14:31.121
I know everything.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.364
(Robyn and Lester laugh)

14:32.400 --> 14:37.133
But you didn't tell your friend
anything about your work here?

14:37.170 --> 14:39.001
Uh, yeah. He thinks
it sounds like a real kick,

14:39.040 --> 14:40.200
starting up
like this.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.141
No. But nothing
about client meetings?

14:43.180 --> 14:45.148
Oh, no, no.

14:45.180 --> 14:47.239
That never leaves these walls.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.249
ALICIA:
It's not us, Mr. Lester.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.282
Those are the three
most honest people I know.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.117
Well, I know a lot
of honest people,

14:55.160 --> 14:58.652
but I don't always trust them
because...

14:58.690 --> 15:00.396
they talk too much.
ALICIA:
Oh.

15:00.430 --> 15:03.365
No, that's...
that's just Robyn's way.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.265
Trust me.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.131
The leak is elsewhere.
Okay.

15:07.170 --> 15:09.138
Now, I'd wanted
to clear everyone

15:09.170 --> 15:11.263
before I asked your firm
to do this,

15:11.310 --> 15:13.574
but events are moving
too quickly,

15:13.610 --> 15:15.475
so, I have to ask you

15:15.510 --> 15:17.478
to, uh, keep this completely
to yourself.

15:17.510 --> 15:19.341
We need you to be on call

15:19.380 --> 15:20.540
at 3:00 tomorrow.

15:20.580 --> 15:22.218
Why?

15:22.250 --> 15:25.083
Well, Mr. Bishop is delivering
something to O'Hare.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.156
In case of trouble,
I need you on call.

15:27.190 --> 15:29.181
This is not a good time
for Mr. Bishop.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.528
I would urge restraint.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.688
Unfortunately, this is
a delivery he can't delay.

15:33.730 --> 15:35.391
Just be on
call at 3:00.

15:35.430 --> 15:38.319
Okay. I...

15:38.370 --> 15:39.598
Oh, God.

15:39.630 --> 15:42.235
What?
I have to go.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.578
Judge Kluger,

15:48.610 --> 15:50.703
I am so sorry.
Oh, Alicia.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.274
Please. It's
no problem.

15:52.310 --> 15:53.618
How are you?
Good.

15:53.650 --> 15:55.117
I'm
I
uh
, so
5
o
rry

15:55.150 --> 15:56.572
I got tied up with a client.

15:56.620 --> 15:57.587
Yes, I figured as much.

15:57.620 --> 16:01.351
Tied up and gagged
to keep you away from me.

16:01.390 --> 16:03.255
(chuckles)
(laughs)

16:03.290 --> 16:05.451
Um, how's the book going?

16:05.490 --> 16:07.594
Oh, it's good.
Uh, uh, good.

16:07.630 --> 16:09.325
Unfortunately,
another judge

16:09.360 --> 16:12.261
has just called me, and-and I'm
gonna have to cut this short.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.188
You... Oh, now?

16:14.240 --> 16:15.593
Yes, unfortunately.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.437
It's a... it's
an emergency.

16:17.470 --> 16:19.461
Okay, um, well, can I...

16:19.510 --> 16:22.536
can I call and-and let me
schedule another time?

16:22.580 --> 16:24.070
That would
be fine, yes.

16:24.110 --> 16:25.646
Well, can I walk you?
Oh, no, no,

16:25.680 --> 16:29.172
uh, because I have to start
this on the phone, so, um...

16:29.220 --> 16:31.279
Why don't you stay
and have a drink?

16:31.320 --> 16:33.356
Again, I'm so sorry.

16:33.390 --> 16:35.358
Yes, this is Kluger.

16:35.390 --> 16:37.381
*

16:40.830 --> 16:42.354
* I'm a big shot

16:43.400 --> 16:46.119
* Yeah, I do what I want to do

16:49.340 --> 16:50.534
* I'm a big shot, baby

16:50.570 --> 16:52.561
What's going on, Cary?

16:52.610 --> 16:54.771
I'm drinking.

16:54.810 --> 16:56.778
Is this some kind of punishment?

16:56.810 --> 16:58.402
No.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.701
You asked me for drinks.

16:59.750 --> 17:02.048
I'm drinking.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.082
Funny.

17:05.220 --> 17:08.018
* Oh, slow down, baby

17:09.220 --> 17:10.528
* I'm trying
to get next to you *

17:14.530 --> 17:17.522
You want to get me to talk,
you just say, "Talk."

17:17.570 --> 17:19.595
Don't play games.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.658
* I'm a big shot...

17:24.710 --> 17:26.359
*

17:43.730 --> 17:47.791
(sighs heavily)

17:47.830 --> 17:49.798
Good evening, Marilyn.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.627
Eli.

17:51.670 --> 17:53.558
It's just the
two of us today.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.363
Peter asked me to
take this meeting.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.436
What?

17:57.470 --> 17:58.664
He's avoiding me.

17:58.710 --> 18:01.178
No. He has a
scheduling conflict.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.405
For our last three meetings?
It's been busy.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.599
Maybe you haven't heard.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.106
He's governor.

18:08.150 --> 18:12.280
You have a great talent for
turning friends into enemies.

18:12.320 --> 18:15.756
Issue a report
supporting the governor.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.782
And I'll be back
in his good graces?

18:18.830 --> 18:21.526
No.

18:39.310 --> 18:41.312
What is it?

18:43.390 --> 18:47.156
A video of a stuffed
ballot box.

18:50.490 --> 18:52.458
Thank you, Marilyn.

18:52.490 --> 18:54.697
This is the first step
toward clean government.

18:58.900 --> 19:02.461
Haven't you seen the statistics
on roadway deaths?

19:02.500 --> 19:04.764
Yeah, but the same statistics
apply when I'm driving.
True, but

19:04.810 --> 19:07.301
that'd be your fault,
not my fault.

19:07.340 --> 19:10.241
(siren wailing)

19:12.280 --> 19:14.612
(siren chirps)

19:17.620 --> 19:19.679
Sir, do you know
why I stopped you?

19:19.720 --> 19:21.585
I have no idea.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.485
You were driving recklessly.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.249
Crossed the median
a few times.
(chuckling):
Oh.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.450
Something funny, sir?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.252
Yes, I find it funny.

19:29.300 --> 19:32.599
Do you always conduct
routine traffic stops with

19:32.630 --> 19:34.689
DEA agents in tow?

19:34.740 --> 19:36.867
Please step out
of the car.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.959
Sir, we see what
appears to be cocaine

19:39.010 --> 19:41.478
in plain view in the
rear of your vehicle.

19:41.510 --> 19:43.546
That gives us probable
cause to search.

19:43.580 --> 19:46.276
I'm now opening up
the trunk of your vehicle.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.287
Hello, Mr. Bishop.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.548
Agent.
You want to tell me

19:54.590 --> 19:56.217
what this is?

19:56.260 --> 19:57.329
That's, uh,
pancake batter, sir.

19:57.360 --> 20:01.251
It's more than 900 grams,
that's ten to 50 years.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.528
For Bisquick?
BISHOP:
Take a look

20:02.560 --> 20:03.822
at the bottom
of the trunk.

20:14.310 --> 20:16.278
(car door opens, closes)

20:16.310 --> 20:18.278
ALICIA:
Robyn, I left you
three messages.

20:18.310 --> 20:19.470
Please call me back.

20:19.510 --> 20:22.570
Has anyone seen Robyn?

20:24.690 --> 20:26.715
Mr. Hayden, have
you seen Robyn?

20:26.750 --> 20:28.286
Uh... there.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.548
ALICIA:
Robyn, where have you been?

20:29.590 --> 20:30.989
Why aren't you
answering your phone?

20:31.030 --> 20:32.782
At lunch. Mr. Lester said

20:32.830 --> 20:34.627
not to take any calls
this afternoon.

20:34.660 --> 20:35.854
He... Why?

20:35.900 --> 20:37.492
Mr. Bishop was
taking something

20:37.530 --> 20:38.929
to the airport at 5:00
and might need me.

20:38.970 --> 20:40.392
No, at 3:00.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.431
No, at 7:00.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.577
ALICIA:
Mr. Bishop,

20:49.610 --> 20:50.645
we're your lawyers.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.477
You need to trust us,
or get new representation,

20:52.510 --> 20:53.579
but this childish test...

20:53.620 --> 20:57.044
I was just pulled over on
the way to the airport.

20:57.080 --> 20:59.617
We told four people
at your office

20:59.650 --> 21:02.619
four different times
for Mr. Bishop's delivery.

21:02.660 --> 21:05.322
1:00 pm. for Mr. Agos,
3:00 for you,

21:05.360 --> 21:10.559
5:00 for Ms. Burdine,
7:00 for Mr. Hayden.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.989
Don't you want to know
when we were pulled over?

21:13.030 --> 21:14.998
No.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.463
3:00, Mrs. Florrick.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.728
Your time.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.981
Mr. Bishop, I didn't...

21:31.020 --> 21:31.987
We told you

21:32.020 --> 21:34.409
and only you, that I was
dropping something off

21:34.460 --> 21:35.916
at the airport at 3:00.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.520
After you were told this,
you met with Judge Kluger.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.949
To discuss his book at lunch.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.025
Did you tell anyone

21:43.060 --> 21:44.527
either in person,
or on the phone?

21:44.570 --> 21:46.390
No!
Did you text

21:46.430 --> 21:48.364
or e-mail?
No, I didn't. I...

21:48.400 --> 21:50.368
I...

21:50.410 --> 21:51.866
Yes?

21:51.910 --> 21:54.037
I left myself
a voice mail reminder.

21:55.010 --> 21:57.604
Did you ever
talk on the phone

21:57.650 --> 21:59.345
about Mr. Bishop's

21:59.380 --> 22:01.109
apartment drophouse?
Yes, with Cary Agos.

22:01.150 --> 22:03.482
We discussed it.
Lemond, don't
use the phone!

22:03.520 --> 22:05.488
Don't worry. It's a burner.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.683
Dex, I need you

22:08.720 --> 22:10.654
to drop off some burners
at Florrick-Agos.

22:10.690 --> 22:13.397
We have... a problem.

22:13.430 --> 22:15.352
The DEA is tapping them.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.368
Drop everything else
and get over there, now.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.799
Hey, this is funny.

22:18.830 --> 22:20.024
What?

22:20.070 --> 22:22.129
They think it's
DEA surveillance.

22:22.170 --> 22:24.001
(giggling)

22:28.080 --> 22:29.035
CARY: _
Burner phones again?

22:29.080 --> 22:30.945
You've done this before?

22:30.980 --> 22:32.948
No, when we were leaving
Lockhart/Gardner.

22:32.980 --> 22:34.140
This is different.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.569
How long do we
have to use these?
We don't know. The DEA

22:36.620 --> 22:38.383
is getting to Bishop through us,

22:38.420 --> 22:39.444
so any business calls,

22:39.490 --> 22:41.378
use these, and be careful,

22:41.420 --> 22:43.650
the packaging can cut.
We got to go to court.

22:43.690 --> 22:45.089
Get a preservation order.

22:45.130 --> 22:46.825
Why? That won't help us now.

22:46.860 --> 22:48.054
It will with the judge.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.523
He already thinks they lied
about the real estate witness.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.663
So, we'll show they lied
to protect their wiretap.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.090
That was... almost Will-like.

22:56.140 --> 22:57.869
Thank you, Diane.

22:57.910 --> 23:01.107
(phone rings)

23:01.140 --> 23:03.608
Be careful what you say.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.869
Hello, this is Alicia Florrick.

23:06.910 --> 23:09.572
Wow, that was formal. It's Eli.

23:09.620 --> 23:12.714
I want to talk to you about
this voter fraud investigation.

23:12.750 --> 23:16.015
ALICIA:
Actually, Eli, let me
call you on another line.

23:16.060 --> 23:17.550
ELI:
Another... Why?

23:17.590 --> 23:19.455
ALICIA:
I'd rather talk to you
on another line.

23:19.490 --> 23:22.197
(clicks keyboard)
Yep, she's on to us,
she's switching numbers.

23:22.230 --> 23:24.425
Who's she on with?

23:24.470 --> 23:25.528
Eli Gold.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.867
Right, one of mine.

23:26.900 --> 23:29.164
We can trace it back
through his line.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.863
Oh, and, uh, Ijust
sent you something.

23:32.910 --> 23:35.777
This isn't one of those things
where the guy jumps up

23:35.810 --> 23:38.472
and scares you?
No, it's pets riding a Roomba,

23:38.510 --> 23:41.172
it's very cute. Watch it,
it goes fast.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.471
electric whooshing

23:42.520 --> 23:44.442
Aah!

23:44.490 --> 23:45.912
Damn it, I hate those.
(chuckles)

23:45.950 --> 23:49.488
I got her on Eli Gold's line.
ELI: Hey, Alicia,
what was wrong with

23:49.520 --> 23:51.556
your work line?
ALICIA: Nothing, we're just
having some issues.

23:51.590 --> 23:52.887
Have Peter call me
on this number

23:52.930 --> 23:54.158
when he wants to talk, okay?

23:54.200 --> 23:57.465
Got her burner number,
I'm sending it to you.

23:57.500 --> 24:00.094
Glad to see you two
are working, finally.

24:00.130 --> 24:01.995
What's up?

24:02.040 --> 24:04.838
We got a problem
with the ManNat warrant.

24:04.870 --> 24:05.802
The...

24:05.840 --> 24:07.899
The one that became
the Florrick warrant.

24:07.940 --> 24:09.601
Oh, right. Lavwer.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.073
She's married to the governor.
Right, well,

24:11.110 --> 24:14.716
she represents a drug dealer
named Lemond Bishop.

24:14.750 --> 24:17.218
They just realized
we're listening.

24:18.950 --> 24:21.714
They what?
They just realized
that we are listening,

24:21.760 --> 24:23.819
well, actually they
think it's the DEA,

24:23.860 --> 24:25.259
but they're still
changing numbers.

24:25.290 --> 24:26.484
How did they realize?

24:26.530 --> 24:28.088
We don't know.

24:28.130 --> 24:30.519
You can get around it?
The new numbers?
No problem,

24:30.570 --> 24:33.539
but we're not sure
how we got exposed.

24:33.570 --> 24:34.559
All right. Come with me.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.828
Let's go.

24:37.270 --> 24:39.238
It wasn't our fault.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.771
I didn't say
it was. Come on.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.778
I've got a
translation to do.
It can wait.

24:42.810 --> 24:45.643
Okay, what do we have today?
It has come to our attention,

24:45.680 --> 24:48.274
Your Honor, that our phones
are being tapped by the DEA.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.289
Excuse me?
Hold on, Frank.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.288
It's come to your attention how?

24:53.320 --> 24:56.118
CARY:
The DEA attempted to execute
an arrest using information

24:56.160 --> 24:57.957
that only could have been
gleaned from our calls.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.526
KLUGER:
Well, that's exciting.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.993
Frank, is it true?

25:01.030 --> 25:02.622
Is your friend
tapping their calls?

25:02.660 --> 25:03.820
Just one second,
Your Honor?

25:03.870 --> 25:06.020
Okay.

25:06.070 --> 25:07.992
What relief are you
looking for, Mr. Agos?

25:08.040 --> 25:09.564
An order to preserve
the wiretaps.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.862
For later discovery?
Yes, Your Honor, we believe

25:10.910 --> 25:12.138
that this...

25:12.170 --> 25:14.309
(sighs) This-this real estate
witness, I forgot her name...

25:14.340 --> 25:16.831
Oh, I forgot her
name. Screw her.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.074
(soft laugh): Well,

25:18.110 --> 25:19.668
We believe, Your Honor,
that she lied

25:19.710 --> 25:21.849
in order to protect the real
reason for the warrant:

25:21.880 --> 25:23.211
the DEA's wiretap.

25:23.250 --> 25:25.582
Wow. Okay, hey,

25:25.620 --> 25:27.315
(whistles)
Frank, where are we?

25:27.350 --> 25:30.729
Uh, Your Honor, uh, h-how could
we possibly preserve a wiretap

25:30.760 --> 25:31.852
when there isn't one.

25:31.890 --> 25:33.255
Your Honor, that's a lie.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.258
The DEA showed their hand...
To suggest

25:35.300 --> 25:37.564
that a U.S. Attorney
would stand in open court

25:37.600 --> 25:39.727
and knowingly deny the existence
of a wiretap is preposterous.

25:39.770 --> 25:41.931
Oh, he happens
to be right.

25:41.970 --> 25:43.631
If the
DEA were

25:43.670 --> 25:45.331
wiretapping your phones,
they would have to say so

25:45.370 --> 25:47.065
or they would
go to jail.

25:47.110 --> 25:48.236
The prosecution has been lying

25:48.280 --> 25:49.929
since they stepped
into this courtroom.

25:49.980 --> 25:52.278
I'm gonna deny the preservation
order because there's

25:52.310 --> 25:54.039
nothing to preserve.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.275
CARY:
Well, then, again,
we ask, Your Honor,

25:56.320 --> 25:58.242
under these circumstances, that
this warrant based on supposed

25:58.290 --> 26:00.952
testimony be thrown out.
And the charges brought

26:00.990 --> 26:03.254
against Mr. Bishop be dismissed.
All right,
I'll consider

26:03.290 --> 26:05.281
the motion, and I will return...
(gavelbangs)

26:05.330 --> 26:06.786
with my ruling.

26:08.830 --> 26:10.718
He's ruling against us.

26:12.330 --> 26:15.037
Here's a difficult decision.
Do we tell Lockhart/Gardner?

26:15.070 --> 26:16.059
Tell them what?

26:16.100 --> 26:17.067
They're being tapped.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.567
I mean, if we are, they are.

26:20.070 --> 26:22.038
I didn't do anything wrong.
I used it

26:22.080 --> 26:23.308
exactly the way
I said I would.

26:23.340 --> 26:26.605
You endangered an NSA warrant.

26:26.650 --> 26:28.072
The subject knows
she's being surveilled.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.076
Look, you were
encouraged to share

26:30.120 --> 26:31.189
your intelligence
with other departments.

26:31.220 --> 26:32.289
That's what you did.

26:32.320 --> 26:34.311
In case you didn't realize,
there's still a drug war

26:34.360 --> 26:35.349
going on in this country.

26:35.390 --> 26:38.359
And a drug war didn't
bring down the Twin Towers.

26:38.390 --> 26:40.381
Oh, God, do you guys love
pulling that out.

26:40.430 --> 26:43.820
This has gone way beyond
terrorism and you know it.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.020
I know we can't do our job
if you keep making mistakes.

26:46.070 --> 26:47.059
Tell him.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.330
The target, Mrs. Florrick,
is changing her numbers.

26:49.370 --> 26:50.735
She's being more cautious.

26:50.770 --> 26:52.738
But about us. The DEA.

26:52.770 --> 26:54.169
Not you guys.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.201
But I...

26:59.050 --> 27:00.677
We're cutting you off.
Oh,

27:00.720 --> 27:02.244
you can't do that.
I just did.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.339
No more tidbits about where
Bishop is picking up his drugs.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.812
Do your own homework.

27:05.850 --> 27:07.408
Yeah, I would,
if we were given

27:07.450 --> 27:09.657
the power
you have...

27:10.990 --> 27:12.651
(snaps fingers)

27:14.730 --> 27:15.822
CARY:
The only explanation
that makes sense

27:15.860 --> 27:18.397
is that the DEA is
tapping our phones.

27:18.430 --> 27:20.398
And they're probably
tapping yours, too.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.295
But they
denied it in court.

27:22.340 --> 27:23.898
Yeah. And they lied

27:23.940 --> 27:25.908
when they put that phony
witness on the stand.

27:25.940 --> 27:27.168
DIANE:
Well, thank you, Cary.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.269
We appreciate you
sharing with us.

27:36.850 --> 27:38.681
What do you think?

27:38.720 --> 27:40.347
I think it would
explain how the DEA

27:40.390 --> 27:42.210
got their
information on Bishop.

27:42.260 --> 27:43.887
It could also be
a Florrick-Agos attempt

27:43.930 --> 27:45.158
to undercut our business.

27:45.190 --> 27:46.350
We have to divulge
to our clients.

27:46.390 --> 27:48.119
Our clients worry
about our security.

27:48.160 --> 27:51.789
Kalinda, why don't you find out
if Cary is telling the truth.

27:51.830 --> 27:53.730
Sure.

27:53.770 --> 27:56.238
The, uh, motion to dismiss
the warrant is denied.

27:56.270 --> 27:59.398
We are gonna go to trial.
Any other motions,

27:59.440 --> 28:02.375
cause of actions, speak now
or forever hold your piece.

28:02.410 --> 28:05.243
Your Honor, I have
a request for a

28:05.280 --> 28:06.440
substitution of counsel.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.046
You what?

28:09.080 --> 28:12.447
AUSA Alvarez
will be stepping in.

28:12.490 --> 28:14.378
Why wasn't this done
in the probable cause hearing?

28:14.420 --> 28:16.388
Why is this being done now?
I am resigning,

28:18.260 --> 28:23.095
No, I mean I am resigning from
my position as US Attorney.

28:23.130 --> 28:24.119
KRUGER:
Is it something we said?

28:24.170 --> 28:26.058
Your Honor, it's not you.
This is an

28:26.100 --> 28:29.831
interofﬁce matter.

28:29.870 --> 28:31.929
What's going on?
I don't know.

28:31.970 --> 28:33.972
Some interagency battle?

28:37.480 --> 28:38.504
Ah, there you are.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.505
We were just leaving.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.472
Do I know you?
No. Not yet.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.886
Nelson Dubeck, with the
Office of Public Integrity.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.286
And this is John,
Ron, and Patrick.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.311
Um, do we have an appointment?

28:48.360 --> 28:50.248
No, I'm sorry, we
didn't have time.

28:50.290 --> 28:51.780
So what is this regarding?

28:51.830 --> 28:53.821
We have a videotape
we would like to show you.

29:04.540 --> 29:07.031
You look like you've seen
this before, Mrs. Florrick.

29:07.070 --> 29:08.230
Really?

29:08.280 --> 29:10.202
What would I look like
ifI hadn't seen it?

29:10.240 --> 29:11.400
Well, in my experience,

29:11.450 --> 29:13.077
when a wife sees
evidence that her husband

29:13.110 --> 29:15.010
has stolen _
something, she is...

29:15.050 --> 29:17.314
surprised.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.386
Oh, I see.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.783
Which one's my husband?

29:21.820 --> 29:24.425
This is serious, Mrs. Florrick.

29:24.460 --> 29:26.428
I would take it seriously.
Mr. Dubeck,

29:26.460 --> 29:29.122
my husband has spent every day

29:29.160 --> 29:31.025
of the last four years
being investigated.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.094
Every single day.

29:32.130 --> 29:33.529
Actually, I'm wrong.

29:33.570 --> 29:35.834
There were six months
when he wasn't investigated,

29:35.870 --> 29:37.565
the six months he was in prison.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.808
You're not inspiring confidence,
Mrs. Florrick.

29:40.840 --> 29:43.206
"The only time my husband didn't
do something wrong

29:43.240 --> 29:45.242
was_ when he was
in prison"?

29:45.280 --> 29:46.941
Did I say something amusing?

29:46.980 --> 29:50.472
I used to be like you:

29:50.520 --> 29:52.283
certain, deferential
to authority...

29:52.320 --> 29:53.958
Is that what I am?

29:53.990 --> 29:55.309
...thinking everyone being
investigated

29:55.360 --> 29:56.987
is obviously guilty.

29:57.020 --> 29:58.521
It's just a matter of time.

29:58.560 --> 30:01.529
You should be investigated.

30:01.560 --> 30:02.652
It changes you.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.089
You know what's different
this time, Mrs. Florrick,

30:05.130 --> 30:08.236
from all the other times your
husband has been investigated?

30:08.270 --> 30:10.830
This time, you were his lawyer.

30:10.870 --> 30:13.031
Yep, on election night.

30:13.070 --> 30:14.435
This time,

30:14.480 --> 30:17.005
you can go to prison yourself.

30:17.040 --> 30:20.043
That's what will
really change you.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.911
Are you here
to serve a subpoena?

30:21.950 --> 30:23.269
No, not yet.
Like I said,

30:23.320 --> 30:25.208
I'm giving you a chance
to get in front of this.

30:25.250 --> 30:28.811
Thank you, but no.

30:30.930 --> 30:33.057
I'd get my affairs in order

30:33.090 --> 30:34.455
if I were you,
Mrs. Florrick.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.127
You've got kids
to think about,

30:36.160 --> 30:38.492
your new law firm.

30:50.980 --> 30:53.244
ALICIA:
Eli, where's Peter?

30:53.280 --> 30:55.043
Where are you calling me from,
China?

30:55.080 --> 30:57.446
It's a bad connection.
Where's Peter?

30:57.480 --> 30:59.243
In a meeting. Why? What's wrong?

30:59.290 --> 31:02.953
A man from the Office of Public
Integrity just left my office.

31:02.990 --> 31:04.423
His name is Nelson Dubeck.

31:04.460 --> 31:06.223
He has a copy of the video
you showed me.

31:06.260 --> 31:07.454
That's impossible.

31:07.490 --> 31:10.197
The Tribune reporter agreed
to hold the story.

31:10.230 --> 31:11.322
Eli, he showed it to me.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.668
Nora, get Marilyn now.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.634
I don't care
what she's doing.
Okay.

31:15.670 --> 31:17.160
Marilyn gave it to him?

31:17.200 --> 31:18.428
I don't know, maybe.

31:18.470 --> 31:21.530
Alicia...

31:21.580 --> 31:23.605
I need to ask you a question.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.507
Marilyn was under the impression

31:26.550 --> 31:28.643
that an old friend of yours
could hurt Peter.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.170
VVho?

31:30.220 --> 31:32.415
Will.

31:32.450 --> 31:33.610
How?

31:33.650 --> 31:35.379
He found the video.

31:35.420 --> 31:38.253
He's the one who told Peter
the votes were fraudulent.

31:38.290 --> 31:41.020
The Feds have nothing
unless they have him.

31:41.060 --> 31:45.394
Do you have any influence
left there?

31:45.430 --> 31:46.966
No.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.298
(taps pen)

31:49.340 --> 31:51.228
You get more
on that drug dealer?

31:51.270 --> 31:53.409
Better.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.635
(ringtones play)

31:55.680 --> 31:57.432
KALIN DA:
Don't.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.948
(ringtones continue)

32:02.650 --> 32:05.084
What if it's important?

32:05.120 --> 32:07.543
Then you'll miss
an important call.

32:07.590 --> 32:10.684
Why were you giving me
the silent treatment?

32:10.720 --> 32:13.188
I can't trust you.

32:13.230 --> 32:15.357
Why not?

32:15.400 --> 32:16.526
(chuckles)

32:16.560 --> 32:19.028
Well, I can't trust you either.

32:19.070 --> 32:20.219
That's true.

32:20.270 --> 32:22.591
Mutually assured destruction.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.335
(both laugh)

32:24.370 --> 32:25.962
Yep.

32:29.410 --> 32:31.640
Are you telling the truth
about the wiretap?

32:35.680 --> 32:38.979
That Lockhart/Gardner is being
wiretapped? Yes.

32:39.020 --> 32:40.988
What are you doing
about it?

32:41.020 --> 32:42.749
Buying burner phones.

32:42.790 --> 32:45.623
Did you alert clients?

32:45.660 --> 32:46.979
We talked about it.

32:47.030 --> 32:48.554
But you haven't yet.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.525
We're getting
our house in order...

32:52.570 --> 32:54.265
and you should, too.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.768
Kalinda,

32:56.800 --> 32:59.633
I'm telling the truth.

33:04.510 --> 33:06.307
He's lying.

33:06.350 --> 33:07.647
You're sure?

33:07.680 --> 33:08.749
Yeah.

33:14.090 --> 33:17.116
Will, Ijust talked to Kalinda.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.388
We're okay.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.318
WILL:
Cary wants us
to chase our tails?

33:20.360 --> 33:22.021
DIANE:
That's what it looks like.

33:22.060 --> 33:24.096
Wow. It's almost fun to watch.

33:24.130 --> 33:27.429
I think Will and Diane
end up getting it on.

33:27.470 --> 33:28.732
What? You're crazy.

33:28.770 --> 33:31.034
Listen to them.
That is not sexual

33:31.070 --> 33:32.503
attraction.

33:32.540 --> 33:34.337
You need a life.

33:34.380 --> 33:38.100
This is a dossier on the new
AUSA, Theresa Alvarez.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.777
Texas Tech undergrad,

33:39.810 --> 33:41.448
Northwestern Law.

33:41.480 --> 33:42.674
She was in tax fraud
before moving

33:42.720 --> 33:45.518
to organized crime.
Where was she born?

33:45.550 --> 33:46.619
ROBYN:
Mm, I don't know.

33:46.650 --> 33:47.685
Where does she live?

33:47.720 --> 33:49.153
We don't need that.
Yes, we do.

33:49.190 --> 33:49.986
Mr. Lester...
CARY:
We should look

33:50.020 --> 33:51.681
into Asher.
Find out why he resigned.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.721
He's a law-and-order
type, so...

33:53.760 --> 33:55.591
my guess is when he heard
about the wiretaps,

33:55.630 --> 33:56.619
it didn't sit well.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.525
A crisis of conscience?

33:58.570 --> 34:00.219
Only one way to find out.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.538
I am not answering
that question.
Sir, if you're aware

34:04.570 --> 34:06.299
of illegal activity...
What I'm aware of

34:06.340 --> 34:08.831
is that my responsibility
to this office does not end

34:08.880 --> 34:11.576
with my departure.
But it ends if someone
in the government

34:11.610 --> 34:15.114
committed a crime.
Hey, how's Tyus?

34:15.150 --> 34:16.640
Excuse me?

34:16.680 --> 34:18.614
Your son, Tyus.

34:18.650 --> 34:20.618
He goes to Tisch now, right?

34:20.650 --> 34:23.289
My nephew Akiva goes
there. He loves the place.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.448
Yeah, Tyus is fine.
And your daughter
Scarlett,

34:26.490 --> 34:29.459
she plays on
that AYSO team.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.764
Am I right?
All right.

34:33.770 --> 34:35.738
This is what's gonna happen,
Mr. Lester.

34:35.770 --> 34:38.409
You're gonna leave my office,
or I'm gonna call the marshal

34:38.440 --> 34:39.634
and have you arrested...
Sir,

34:39.670 --> 34:41.831
I'm sorry.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.769
_ I used to work as
an investigator for Treasury,

34:44.810 --> 34:46.471
so I get what
you're going through.

34:46.510 --> 34:49.513
Sometimes you see something
that doesn't make sense,

34:49.550 --> 34:51.848
something wrong,
and you can't participate.

34:51.890 --> 34:55.314
But it's also wrong
to pretend it didn't happen.
No. But nice try

34:55.360 --> 34:56.782
using my conscience against me.

34:56.820 --> 34:59.152
Lemond Bishop
is a scumbag

34:59.190 --> 35:01.294
who should be dropped
in the deepest hole

35:01.330 --> 35:03.218
_ in the U.S. _
Penitentiary Serwce.

35:03.260 --> 35:06.423
But this isn't about him
or the DEA.

35:06.470 --> 35:08.836
The wiretap isn't?

35:08.870 --> 35:10.838
What's it about?

35:10.870 --> 35:13.839
IfI have a confession to make,

35:13.870 --> 35:16.805
I'll make it to my priest.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.877
This isn't over yet.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.745
LESTER:
Mr. Asher, the warrant

35:24.790 --> 35:28.157
w... Uh, strike that.

35:28.190 --> 35:30.886
Given that, um... Strike that.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.299
Did you prepare
the warrant

35:34.330 --> 35:36.924
that is the subject
of this probable cause hearing?

35:36.960 --> 35:39.793
That's the one.
Objection.
Work product, Your Honor.

35:39.830 --> 35:41.730
Mr. Asher worked
with the prosecution.
Yes,

35:41.770 --> 35:43.795
until he resigned
two days ago.
Yes, but he was priw

35:43.840 --> 35:45.603
to our trial strategy.
So I won't ask

35:45.640 --> 35:47.267
about trial strategy.

35:47.310 --> 35:50.871
This is about the prosecution
perjuring themselves.

35:50.910 --> 35:52.741
Ouch.

35:52.780 --> 35:53.906
In what way?
We believe

35:53.950 --> 35:56.214
there's an active wiretap.
"Believe,"

35:56.250 --> 35:57.877
Your Honor.
This is a fishing expedition.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.945
Yeah, but it's actually
pretty specific

35:59.990 --> 36:01.309
for a fishing expedition.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.851
I'm gonna overrule,
but...

36:03.890 --> 36:07.656
be ready for a great
Monty Python-sized boot

36:07.690 --> 36:10.193
coming down on your head,
Mr. Lester,

36:10.230 --> 36:11.959
if you stray
too far afield.
Got it, Your Honor.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.460
The warrant that you prepared
for this hearing, was that

36:16.500 --> 36:20.459
based on the sworn affidavit
of DEA Agent Lee Cheswick?

36:20.510 --> 36:21.909
Yes.

36:21.940 --> 36:24.875
Are you aware of any wiretaps
that were

36:24.910 --> 36:27.242
in fact
the undisclosed basis

36:27.280 --> 36:30.613
of this warrant?
Objection.
No foundation.

36:32.390 --> 36:33.982
Of course there's no foundation.

36:34.020 --> 36:36.989
If the warrant was fabricated,
the foundation's been concealed.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.829
Overruled.

36:38.860 --> 36:40.725
Please answer, Mr. Asher.

36:43.730 --> 36:45.869
M_r. Asher?
On adVIce of counsel,

36:45.900 --> 36:47.219
I refuse to answer
on the grounds

36:47.270 --> 36:48.567
that my answer

36:48.600 --> 36:50.932
may incriminate me.
KLUGER:
Well,

36:50.970 --> 36:52.631
we have ourselves a ball game.

36:52.670 --> 36:53.932
Judge, no adverse inference
can be drawn

36:53.970 --> 36:55.938
from Mr. Asher's invocation
of the Fifth.
Thank you, Counselor.

36:55.980 --> 36:58.699
I'm actually familiar
with the Constitution.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.502
Do you have
any further thoughts?

37:00.550 --> 37:01.847
No, Your Honor.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.286
Well, that went better
than expected.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.880
Robyn, what did you say Asher
said about the wiretaps?

37:08.920 --> 37:11.423
The thing about it
not being about Bishop?

37:11.460 --> 37:13.758
Or the DEA, right?

37:13.790 --> 37:15.758
Have you ever heard of
parallel construction?

37:15.800 --> 37:17.893
No.
All right, well,

37:17.930 --> 37:20.421
this is a Reuters
article on the NSA.

37:20.470 --> 37:22.438
The NSA?
Yeah.

37:22.470 --> 37:24.904
They've been handing tips
gleaned from their surveillance

37:24.940 --> 37:27.909
on to other departments,
including the DEA.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.004
What?
Yeah. So...

37:32.050 --> 37:34.006
according to
this article,

37:34.050 --> 37:37.872
the DEA can't use classified
information to build a case

37:37.920 --> 37:40.411
so it _creates a _
new eVIdence trail.

37:40.450 --> 37:42.054
Like the real estate witness.
Yeah.

37:42.090 --> 37:44.012
That's parallel construction.

37:44.060 --> 37:45.027
Wait, so...

37:45.060 --> 37:49.019
you're saying that the NSA
is surveilling Bishop?

37:49.060 --> 37:50.755
Yeah.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.722
Or us.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.996
You know we're trying
to fight terrorists here.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.735
I do know that.

37:58.770 --> 38:00.135
It's a very important job.

38:00.170 --> 38:03.071
You've also_been asked
to a55ist our investigation.
We already have

38:03.110 --> 38:04.407
a leak from this warrant.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.305
Not from our department.
The target knows

38:07.350 --> 38:08.749
she's being surveilled.
Well, again,

38:08.780 --> 38:11.749
that's not from my department.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.610
What do you have?

38:14.990 --> 38:16.958
ELI:
Alicia,

38:16.990 --> 38:19.481
I need to ask you a question.

38:19.530 --> 38:22.749
Marilyn was under the impression
that an old friend of yours

38:22.800 --> 38:24.495
could hurt Peter.

38:24.530 --> 38:25.827
ALICIA:
VVho?

38:25.870 --> 38:27.826
ELI:
Will.

38:27.870 --> 38:28.962
ALICIA:
How?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.831
ELI:
He found the video.

38:30.870 --> 38:33.031
He's the one who told Peter
the votes were fraudulent.

38:33.070 --> 38:37.109
The Feds have nothing
unless they have him.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.108
Yes.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.812
That is interesting.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.381
BAILIFF: All rise.
KLUGER: Thank you.

38:47.420 --> 38:50.787
You know, this one is tough
because-- thank you--

38:50.820 --> 38:53.584
on one hand,
we have a-a quantity

38:53.630 --> 38:56.622
of cocaine that has been found
on the defendant.

38:56.660 --> 38:58.799
Your Honor, we would disp...
And on the other,

38:58.830 --> 39:01.799
we have a witness
who doesn't seem

39:01.840 --> 39:03.831
to know one day
from another,

39:03.870 --> 39:06.430
and a prosecutor
who just won't talk.

39:06.470 --> 39:07.539
Judge,
ifI may...
You may not.

39:07.570 --> 39:08.878
This is when I talk

39:08.910 --> 39:10.639
and this is when you... listen.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.807
Despite Ms. Alvarez's
admonition,

39:12.850 --> 39:14.147
the court
may and does

39:14.180 --> 39:16.774
draw an adverse inference

39:16.820 --> 39:18.845
from Mr. Asher's performance.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.881
I find the warrant
at issue

39:20.920 --> 39:23.616
to be compromised,
and therefore,

39:23.660 --> 39:25.719
the motion to quash is granted.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.751
(gavelbangs)

39:30.200 --> 39:31.519
DETECTIVE GIFFORD:
You can't cross the line

39:31.570 --> 39:33.765
and then act like you
didn't cross the line.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.438
Then shoot me.

39:38.470 --> 39:39.437
Shoot me.

39:39.470 --> 39:40.459
Who's that?

39:40.510 --> 39:41.704
That's his
girlfriend.

39:41.740 --> 39:42.832
She's pregnant.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.609
Well...

39:44.650 --> 39:45.742
why does he want
to kill her?

39:45.780 --> 39:47.008
She was with his partner.

39:47.050 --> 39:48.642
Okay.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.717
I think this will make sense
if I get more wine.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.681
(line ringing)

39:57.720 --> 39:58.789
KLUGER:
Kluger.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.684
Hi, uh, Judge.
Alicia Florrick.

40:00.730 --> 40:02.027
I hope this is a good time.

40:02.060 --> 40:03.994
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Florrick?

40:04.030 --> 40:06.521
Oh, I wanted
to reschedule our lunch.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.525
You did?

40:07.570 --> 40:09.731
Yes. Uh, to talk
about your book.

40:09.770 --> 40:11.533
Well, that's very kind of you.

40:11.570 --> 40:13.037
I've decided not
to write that book.

40:13.070 --> 40:14.435
Oh.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.936
See, publishing is a mug's game.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.436
I'm learning Mandarin.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.505
I see.

40:19.550 --> 40:21.541
Um, well, we could...

40:21.580 --> 40:23.445
Yes, and I've-I've mastered
a new phrase.

40:23.480 --> 40:26.483
Zai jian.

40:26.520 --> 40:27.487
It means "good night."

40:27.520 --> 40:28.487
ALICIA:
Good...

40:28.520 --> 40:30.613
(call cuts off)

40:30.660 --> 40:32.628
What?
Nothing.

40:32.660 --> 40:34.594
I just feel
bad for her.
The Florrick lady?

40:34.630 --> 40:36.029
Don't worry,
she'll be all right.

40:36.060 --> 40:37.857
You think so?
No.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.765
I don't know.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.462
It's_ none of
our busmess anyway.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.502
(elevator bell dings)

40:56.180 --> 40:58.148
Thanks for seeing me,
Mr. Gardner.

40:58.180 --> 41:00.011
Yeah, I had a feeling
it was one of those

41:00.050 --> 41:02.553
"speak to me now or speak
to me later" kind of things.

41:03.590 --> 41:05.023
Just a few questions.

41:05.060 --> 41:06.652
If any of
these questions

41:06.690 --> 41:07.725
touch upon
Governor Florrick

41:07.760 --> 41:08.988
in the time _
I represented him,

41:09.030 --> 41:10.725
then I am bound by
attorney-client privilege.

41:10.760 --> 41:11.829
You are not bound

41:11.870 --> 41:13.724
if you were asked to protect
an ongoing conspiracy.

41:13.770 --> 41:15.192
What ongoing conspiracy?

41:15.240 --> 41:17.697
The election fraud
this video depicts

41:17.740 --> 41:20.800
and the ensuing cover-up
you participated in

41:20.840 --> 41:23.832
constitutes an
ongomg crime.

41:23.880 --> 41:26.144
Now, if you answer
my questions,

41:26.180 --> 41:27.704
I can offer
a grant

41:27.750 --> 41:29.877
of transactional immunity.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.241
But you have to cooperate fully.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.509
If any of your questions
touch upon Governor Florrick

41:37.560 --> 41:38.652
in the time I represented him...

41:38.690 --> 41:39.657
I was under
the impre55ion

41:39.690 --> 41:42.295
that Governor Florrick's wife

41:42.330 --> 41:43.649
stole some of your top clients.

41:45.800 --> 41:47.859
You'll really do
hard time for him?

41:49.970 --> 41:51.608
If any of your questions

41:51.640 --> 41:53.062
touch upon Governor Florrick...
All right.

41:53.110 --> 41:55.635
This is a subpoena.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.568
Let's see how
your resolve stands up

41:57.610 --> 41:58.770
in front of a grand jury.

42:00.310 --> 42:01.277
Or...

42:01.310 --> 42:03.517
you can talk to me now.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.646
It was nice meeting you,
Mr. Dubeck.

42:08.690 --> 42:11.215
And you.

42:11.260 --> 42:13.125
See you again very soon.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.991
Can't wait.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.991
(door opens)

42:29.380 --> 42:32.201
