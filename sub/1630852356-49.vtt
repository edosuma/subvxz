Thank you, Community Sue.
But I won't be satisfied

00:59.276 --> 01:01.626
until I can sing a note so high,

01:01.670 --> 01:03.889

We need way more practice

01:13.551 --> 01:14.987
Hi Cricket.
Have you seen Gramma?

01:15.031 --> 01:17.120
She always has a lozenge
or two on her,

01:17.164 --> 01:19.905
and I need to keep my voice
in tip-top condition.

01:19.949 --> 01:22.169
Oh, yeah, she's over there
being forced to help.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.910
Dang chair won't open!

01:24.954 --> 01:27.609
This is all a bunch of blort!

01:28.436 --> 01:30.133
How long have you two
been standing there?

01:30.177 --> 01:32.135
Long enough to hear
everything you just said.

01:32.179 --> 01:35.007
Well, how could I have
said anything if I'm not here?

01:35.051 --> 01:37.140
What're you?

01:37.184 --> 01:39.403
Blort.
What a funny word.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.492
Oh! How rude!

01:41.536 --> 01:45.148
That was weird. Tilly,
you're old and wise.
What's it mean?

01:45.192 --> 01:47.237
I believe it's
what's known as a cuss word.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.979
A cuss!?

01:50.022 --> 01:52.547
Yes. Which is why we'd best
erase the word from our memory.

01:52.590 --> 01:55.463
Memory wipe initiating.
Ahh.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.508
I think not, dear sister.

01:57.552 --> 02:00.555
I've spent all my
formative years trying
to figure out the cusses.

02:00.598 --> 02:03.166
And now I finally know one!

02:03.210 --> 02:04.559

Back to your positions, people!

- Oh, hi Cricket...
- Blort!

02:10.042 --> 02:12.132
Cricket!
That's a bad word!

02:12.175 --> 02:14.917

It's blorting fun!

it would be funny

10:35.156 --> 10:36.505
We love you!

10:36.548 --> 10:38.289
Ahh!

10:38.333 --> 10:40.074
-Nice work, Alice.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.075
Mom! Dad!
Mama! Papa!

10:41.118 --> 10:42.990
Hey kids, great concert!

10:43.033 --> 10:44.295
Yeah, incredible singing.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.906
Thank you.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.734
I especially liked
your performance, son.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.170
Very restrained.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.127
Heh. Thanks, Dad.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.955
I thought about cussing.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.020
But eventually I realized
I didn't wanna be the jerk

10:54.044 --> 10:55.524
that ruined everyone's day.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.700
Aw. That's all
I could ever ask.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.397
Alright, gang. Show's over.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.008
Let's get the blort outta here.
