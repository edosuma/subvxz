IS KISSING

07:08.219 --> 07:09.971

WOULD BE A LOT HAPPIER

07:29.782 --> 07:30.575
IF THEY LEARNED HOW TO DEAL
WITH THEIR PROBLEMS

07:30.658 --> 07:32.243
BEFORE THEY EVEN CAME UP.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.400
SHE'S JUST NOT SEXY,
HONEY-TRAP MATERIAL.

TO REMEMBER

08:47.693 --> 08:49.737
HOW SMITTEN I WAS WITH HER.

08:49.820 --> 08:50.571
- YOU TURNED THE MICROPHONE OFF,
RIGHT?

08:50.655 --> 08:51.572
- NO.

08:51.656 --> 08:56.410
NO, HE DID NOT.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.787
- OH, MOM.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.789
UH, I-I HAVE SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.415
IT'S KIND OF BIG
AND IT--IT MIGHT COME OFF

09:01.499 --> 09:02.625
AS A BIT OF A SHOCK.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.418
- OH, GOD, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME

09:04.502 --> 09:07.630
I CAN'T PULL OFF
SLEEVELESS DRESSES ANYMORE.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.923
- [laughs]
OH, NO, HONEY.

09:09.006 --> 09:12.051
YOU GOT ARMS
LIKE AN EGYPTIAN PRIESTESS.

09:12.134 --> 09:14.387
NO, UM, IT--IT'S ABOUT ME.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.180
- YOU AND JUSTIN?

09:16.264 --> 09:17.348
- UH, YES.

09:17.431 --> 09:18.266
- OH, HE IS VERY HANDSOME.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.850
- UH-UH, YES, HE IS.

09:19.934 --> 09:20.977
- YOU KNOW, I WAS A LITTLE
SURPRISED TO SEE YOU

09:21.060 --> 09:23.354
WITH A REDHEAD,
BUT IN ANY EVENT,

09:23.437 --> 09:26.941
YOU'LL HAVE BEAUTIFUL
VIETNAMESE CHILDREN.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.442
- OH, MOM.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.152
I THINK YOU'RE GETTING
A LITTLE AHEAD OF YOURSELF.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.697
[laughs]
- OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.323
I MEAN,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN MARRIED YET.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.367
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE
GONNA GET MARRIED.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.286
YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN APART
FOR SO LONG,

09:38.369 --> 09:41.330
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOU,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.666
BUT IF I COULD THROW YOU
A BIG WEDDING, OH,

09:43.749 --> 09:46.669
NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.671
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WERE GONNA SAY?

09:48.754 --> 09:50.548
SAY, "YES."

09:53.884 --> 09:55.845
I HAVE
A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.472
MY SON IS GETTING MARRIED.

09:58.556 --> 09:59.974
- DUDE, CONGRATULATIONS.

10:00.057 --> 10:03.019
TO WHO?

10:03.102 --> 10:05.062
- TO YOU, SILLY.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.689
- OH.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.816
- HE'S SO FORGETFUL,
HE FORGOT HE PROPOSED.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.569
- I DID.
BUT NOW I REMEMBER.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.739
IT'S ALL HAPPENING SO FAST.

10:14.822 --> 10:17.700
I HAVEN'T QUITE
PROCESSED IT YET.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.035
- FOR A WEDDING GIFT,

10:19.118 --> 10:21.829
I AM GOING TO BUY YOU
MATCHING PORSCHES.

10:21.912 --> 10:25.291
- MOM!

10:31.088 --> 10:34.759
- IT'S GREAT THAT YOU DECIDED
TO SEEK GUIDANCE EARLY.

10:34.842 --> 10:35.885
- WELL, WE'VE BOTH SEEN
OUR FAIR SHARE

10:35.968 --> 10:37.261
OF BAD RELATIONSHIPS.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.888
- YES,
AND WE'RE BOTH DETECTIVES,

10:38.971 --> 10:41.849
SO WE HAVE A TENDENCY
TOWARDS SUSPICION,

10:41.932 --> 10:43.726
EVEN THOUGH THE TWO OF US
ARE SOUL MATES.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.187
- UH-OH.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.898
WHEN YOU SAY, "SOUL MATES,"
THAT'S A RED FLAG.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.900
AFTER ALL, RELATIONSHIPS
AREN'T FAIRY TALES.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.194
- BUT I RATHER LIKE
FAIRY TALES.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.364
- FAIRY TALES
ARE FOR CHILDREN.

10:56.447 --> 11:00.034
NOW, TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.077
- LOTS OF THINGS.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.914
WE BOTH LIKE WINE
AND SEX AND--

11:04.997 --> 11:07.333
- AND WHEN WE COMBINE THE TWO,
IT'S FANTASTIC.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.085
[both laugh]

11:09.168 --> 11:11.003
- BUT WHAT ABOUT DEEPER ISSUES?

11:11.087 --> 11:12.755
- WELL, TO BE HONEST,

11:12.838 --> 11:14.423
IF I NEED TO KNOW
ANYTHING DEEPER,

11:14.507 --> 11:15.758
I'LL JUST WAIT
TILL HE FALLS ASLEEP

11:15.841 --> 11:17.551
AND SNOOP THROUGH HIS COMPUTER.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.594
- YOU DO THAT, TOO?
- YES.

11:18.677 --> 11:19.887
- AW.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.765
- AH, SEE?
SOUL MATES.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.183
- HOW DO YOU TWO
HANDLE CONFLICT?

11:24.266 --> 11:25.267
- OH, WE NEVER FIGHT.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.602
- AND WE NEVER WILL.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.396
- OKAY, BUT LACK OF CONFLICT

11:28.479 --> 11:30.940
IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST RED FLAGS
OF ALL.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.608
HERE'S A COMPATIBILITY QUIZ.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.276
IT'S DESIGNED
TO DETERMINE IF YOU TWO

11:34.360 --> 11:37.279
ARE EMOTIONALLY SUITED
FOR THE LONG RUN.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.447
- SOUNDS FUN.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.533
- SOUNDS LIKE HOMEWORK.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.284
- WONDERFUL.
A LITTLE CONFLICT.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.245
WE'RE OFF TO A GREAT START.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.669
- YOU'RE SAFE.
VICTORIA'S NOT HERE.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.295
- OH, THANK GOD.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.131
SHE IS DRIVING ME CRAZY
WITH ALL THESE WEDDING PLANS.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.759
- YOU SAW
THE MATCHING SAILOR OUTFITS?

11:58.843 --> 11:59.969
- WHAT?

12:00.052 --> 12:03.013
- OH, NOTHING.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.974
- [sighs]

12:05.057 --> 12:07.101
I JUST CAN'T KEEP PRETENDING
TO BE GAY.

12:07.184 --> 12:10.271
- BACK IN MY DAY,
ALL MEN WERE STRAIGHT.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.858
EVEN THE MEN
WHO SLEPT WITH OTHER MEN.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.317
- DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD TELL HER?

12:15.401 --> 12:16.777
- YOU'RE HERE,
YOU'RE NOT QUEER,

12:16.861 --> 12:21.323
SHE'LL GET USED TO IT.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.992
- OKAY, I'LL TELL HER.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.286
- OH, THERE YOU ARE, DARLING.

12:25.369 --> 12:28.330
LOOK WHAT I FOUND FOR
THE TOP OF YOUR WEDDING CAKE.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.958
[laughs]
AH.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.543
IT'S YOU AND JUSTIN.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.003
AND IF YOU PRESS THAT BUTTON,

12:34.086 --> 12:36.297
IT PLAYS THE THEME SONG
FROM <i> WILL &amp; GRACE.</i>

12:39.258 --> 12:41.010
PLANNING THIS WEDDING
HAS MADE ME FEEL CLOSER

12:41.093 --> 12:44.138
TO YOU THAN EVER.

12:46.557 --> 12:51.270
- OH, GOD, I CAN'T TELL HER.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.230
- I WAS HOPING
WE'D RUN INTO EACH OTHER AGAIN.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.857
- ME, TOO.

12:54.940 --> 12:58.027
BUT COULD WE NOT TALK
ABOUT MY KIDS THIS TIME?

12:58.110 --> 12:59.236
- HOW ABOUT
YOU BUY ME A DRINK

12:59.320 --> 13:00.821
AND WE'LL JUST TALK ABOUT US?

13:00.905 --> 13:03.866
- GOOD, SHE'S FOLLOWING
OUR SCRIPT.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.534
- WELL, WE'VE GOT SOME TIME.

13:05.618 --> 13:09.246
LET'S GO OVER
OUR COMPATIBILITY QUIZ.

13:09.330 --> 13:14.919
- I GOT
"A, C, D, B, B, D, A, C, D."

13:15.002 --> 13:18.214
SO WHAT'S OUR
COMPATIBILITY SCORE?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.341
- ZERO.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.551
- ZERO?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.220
WELL, I'M NOT WORRIED.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.431
I STILL FEEL GOOD
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.893
- ME, TOO.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.229
I'M NOT WORRIED EITHER.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.690
- GOOD.

13:36.774 --> 13:39.693
- DO YOU REALIZE
YOU JUST ATE AN ENTIRE DOUGHNUT?

13:39.777 --> 13:43.113
- I DON'T THINK SO.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.033
- SO, MAYBE
WE SHOULD CHECK IN ON MELANIE.

13:46.116 --> 13:48.911
THE SEDUCTION
SHOULD BE WELL UNDERWAY BY NOW.

13:48.994 --> 13:52.122
- SO, TELL ME WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.707
- I'M GONNA GO HOME,

13:53.791 --> 13:54.792
TELL MY WIFE I LOVE HER,

13:54.875 --> 13:56.252
AND WORK ON OUR RELATIONSHIP.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.922
- YOU DO THAT, BIG BOY.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.430
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO WORK

14:08.514 --> 14:10.015
ON CASES ANYMORE?

14:10.099 --> 14:11.767
WHY?

14:11.850 --> 14:14.895
- BECAUSE YOU ARE
THE WORST HONEY TRAP EVER.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.605
ELKA COULD DO A BETTER JOB.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.901
- YOU COULDN'T AFFORD ME.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.611
- WELL, THE GOOD NEWS
IS NOW YOU CAN HELP ME

14:22.695 --> 14:24.238
PLAN TONY'S WEDDING.

14:24.321 --> 14:27.283
- YEAH, VICTORIA,
ABOUT THE WEDDING.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.119
IF TONY WEREN'T GAY,
YOU WOULD STILL LOVE HIM, RIGHT?

14:30.202 --> 14:31.453
- BUT HE IS GAY.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.581
- IMAGINE HE WASN'T.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.958
- I WILL DO NO SUCH THING.
IT--

14:36.041 --> 14:37.918
WELL, I HAD NO IDEA YOU HAD
A PROBLEM WITH THIS.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.420
- NO, IT--
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.463
I JUST--I DON'T THINK
THIS WEDDING IS RIGHT.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.173
- WOW.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.302
MUCH HAS BEEN LEARNED
ABOUT MELANIE THIS WEEK.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.720
SHE CAN'T SEDUCE STRANGERS,

14:47.803 --> 14:51.098
AND SHE'S MORE
THAN A LITTLE HOMOPHOBIC.

14:51.181 --> 14:52.766
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
ANYONE'S GOING TO NEED

14:52.850 --> 14:56.020
TO BE PLANNING MY WEDDING
ANYTIME SOON.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.813
MITCH AND I GOT
A BIG, FAT ZERO

14:57.896 --> 14:59.857
ON OUR COMPATIBILITY TEST.

14:59.940 --> 15:03.611
- DON'T YOU MEAN
A BIG, FLAT ZERO?

15:07.406 --> 15:10.117
- NOW I'M AFRAID HE'S DOUBTING
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.494
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET HIM
TO ADMIT IT.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.996
- WELL, YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT
THE TRUTH.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.539
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:15.623 --> 15:21.003
SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY,
I HAVE TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.129
MITCH?

15:22.212 --> 15:23.213
I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING,

15:23.297 --> 15:26.008
AND I NEED YOU
TO BE HONEST WITH ME.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.384
ARE YOU DOUBTING
OUR RELATIONSHIP?

15:27.468 --> 15:29.011
- HONESTLY?

15:29.094 --> 15:31.388
I AM SORT OF DOUBTING IT.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.140
I'M ALSO DOUBTING THAT
I CAN KEEP FROM STARING

15:33.223 --> 15:35.893
AT THAT WOMAN'S BREASTS
OVER THERE.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.353
WHY DID I JUST TELL YOU THAT?

15:37.436 --> 15:42.024
- BECAUSE I PUT TRUTH SERUM
IN YOUR COFFEE.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.360
WAIT,
WHY DID I JUST TELL YOU THAT?

15:44.443 --> 15:48.364
- BECAUSE I PUT TRUTH SERUM
IN YOUR COFFEE.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.408
- YOU DRUGGED EACH OTHER?

15:51.492 --> 15:53.035
- YES, BUT WITH GOOD REASON.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.412
WE DIDN'T TRUST EACH OTHER
ENOUGH TO TELL THE TRUTH.

15:55.496 --> 16:00.042
- IT WAS JUST
A LITTLE SODIUM PENTOTHAL.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.837
SURELY OTHER COUPLES WITH ZEROS
ON THEIR COMPATIBILITY TESTS

16:03.921 --> 16:07.007
WENT ON TO HAVE LONG AND HAPPY
RELATIONSHIPS, RIGHT?

16:07.091 --> 16:10.386
- YES, BUT NOT WITH EACH OTHER.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.722
BASED ON YOUR QUIZ RESULTS,
YOU SHOULD BE ASKING YOURSELF,

16:13.806 --> 16:16.558
SHOULD YOU REALLY BE TOGETHER?

16:16.642 --> 16:17.768
- I'M NOT SURE.

16:17.851 --> 16:18.852
- ME EITHER.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.062
- SEE?

16:20.145 --> 16:22.523
IT'S GOOD YOU GUYS
CAME TO ME EARLY.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.531
- SO WHO WANTS TO BE THE FIRST
TO TOAST THE HAPPY COUPLE?

16:30.614 --> 16:32.866
[laughs]
MELANIE?

16:32.950 --> 16:33.742
- I'M SORRY, VICTORIA,
I JUST--

16:33.826 --> 16:35.411
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
DOING THAT.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.412
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.373
YOU'RE A RAGING HOMOPHOBE.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.417
ELKA, HOW ABOUT YOU?

16:41.500 --> 16:43.919
- OH, TONY KNOWS HOW I FEEL.

16:44.002 --> 16:48.424
- WELL, ONCE AGAIN,
I HAVE TO SAVE THE DAY.

16:48.507 --> 16:52.928
TONY, JUSTIN,
I AM SO PROUD AND HAPPY.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.763
I JUST WANT TO SHARE
THIS WITH THE WORLD.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.308
FRIENDS, FANS, FELLOW DINERS,

16:58.392 --> 17:02.771
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT SO MAJOR
I AM FAIRLY BURSTING.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.816
MY GAY SON TONY
IS GETTING MARRIED.

17:05.898 --> 17:07.443
NOW I KNOW THAT
THAT MAY COME AS A SHOCK

17:07.526 --> 17:08.318
TO SOME OF YOU HERE

17:08.402 --> 17:10.779
IN THE BACKWARD PROVINCE
OF CLEVELAND.

17:10.863 --> 17:15.325
- NO, IT DOESN'T.
WE'RE FINE WITH IT.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.412
- WELL, LOOK AT ME,
CHANGING HEARTS AND MINDS.

17:18.494 --> 17:21.080
CHAMPAGNE FOR EVERYONE.
[glasses clinking]

17:21.165 --> 17:23.666
OH, THEY WANT YOU TO KISS.
- [nervous laugh]

17:23.751 --> 17:25.461
TWO SECONDS, NO TONGUE.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.296
I WANT MY PORSCHE.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.470
- MOM, I'M SORRY!

17:34.553 --> 17:35.804
I CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH
THIS WEDDING.

17:35.888 --> 17:36.847
- WHY NOT?
WHAT DID I DO?

17:36.930 --> 17:38.849
I CAN CHANGE.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.023
- SO, UH...

17:46.106 --> 17:50.152
WHEN DID YOU REALIZE
YOU WERE STRAIGHT?

17:50.235 --> 17:52.863
- HM, I GUESS
A PART OF ME ALWAYS KNEW.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.657
- MAYBE A PART OF ME
ALWAYS KNEW TOO.

17:55.741 --> 18:00.329
WOW...I HAVE A NON-GAY SON.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.789
I GUESS I'M JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO GET USED TO TELLING

18:01.872 --> 18:04.708
PEOPLE THAT MY SON LIKES...

18:04.792 --> 18:07.669
WOMEN.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.297
- WELL, NOT WOMEN.
A WOMAN.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.673
I HAVE THIS GORGEOUS GIRLFRIEND
AND--

18:11.757 --> 18:15.010
- ALL RIGHT, NO DETAILS,
I'M NOT THERE YET.

18:15.093 --> 18:16.970
- I KNOW IT'S A LOT
TO PROCESS.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.514
- YEAH.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.140
WELL, NOW THAT WE'RE
BEING TOTALLY HONEST

18:20.224 --> 18:23.018
WITH EACH OTHER, UM...

18:23.101 --> 18:25.646
DID YOU CHOOSE TO LIVE WITH
YOUR FATHER BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT

18:25.729 --> 18:27.564
I COULDN'T ACCEPT
YOUR BEING STRAIGHT?

18:27.648 --> 18:30.859
- NO, I CHOSE DAD
BECAUSE HE NEEDED ME MORE.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.902
AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S PROBABLY
NOT HEALTHY FOR A KID

18:31.985 --> 18:34.571
TO TAKE CARE OF HIS PARENT,
THAT'S WHAT I DID.
