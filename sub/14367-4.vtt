{\an8}and NICKELODEON]

00:57.390 --> 01:01.060
{\an5}Ginger:
Well, we can't have
the slumber party at my house.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.897
Our VCR's still broken
since, you know...

01:03.980 --> 01:05.940
{\an7}Someone has to
tell your brother

01:06.024 --> 01:08.651
{\an8}that maple syrup
and electronics
just don't mix.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.445
{\an1}Let's just do it
at my house.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.573
{\an5}Everyone's p.j.'s
are still there
from last weekend.

01:13.656 --> 01:16.785
{\an1}Now-- who wants to be
in charge of refreshments?

01:16.868 --> 01:18.411
Miranda, are you listening?!

01:18.495 --> 01:21.831
{\an1}They actually go to each other's
houses... and sleep there!

01:21.915 --> 01:22.916
Yes, I'm familiar
with the concept.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.877
It's quite popular
amongst our peers.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.546
What do you suppose they do
at these "slumber parties"?

01:28.630 --> 01:29.506
{\an8}From what I understand

01:29.589 --> 01:32.342
{\an8}they stay up all night
telling moronic stories

01:32.425 --> 01:34.803
{\an8}and gorging on white-
flour-based party foods.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.305
{\an8}I could do that. I know
plenty of moronic stories.

01:37.388 --> 01:40.016
{\an8}Or at the very least,
I could pinch some off Blake.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.602
{\an8}You are not
suggesting...

01:42.685 --> 01:45.522
{\an8}Yes! I want to
have one, too.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.106
{\an8}So, apparently, Mumma

01:47.190 --> 01:51.027
{\an8}slumber parties are
all the rage in school.

01:51.110 --> 01:53.613
{\an8}I'm not quite sure
I understand.

01:53.696 --> 01:54.906
{\an8}Oh, It's fabulous!

01:54.989 --> 01:57.826
{\an8}A small group
of extra-special friends

01:57.909 --> 02:00.662
{\an8}agree to sleep on the floor
of your home.

02:00.745 --> 02:02.455
(<i> chuckles</i> )

02:02.539 --> 02:03.998
Dear, you must have heard
incorrectly.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.669
Why would anyone willingly
sleep on a floor

02:07.752 --> 02:10.003
unless, of course,
there was a national emergency?

02:10.088 --> 02:12.549
A flood, or one of
those whirly things.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.592
It's true, Mumma!

02:14.676 --> 02:16.594
I've seen it on the television.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.721
Please? It would mean
the world to me

02:18.805 --> 02:20.682
and these six girls,
carefully chosen

02:20.765 --> 02:22.517
and screened
for fashion sense.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.268
Hmm...

02:23.351 --> 02:25.812
If Courtney's having
a sleepover

02:25.895 --> 02:28.898
I get to host my own
ripping affair, too, I say!

02:28.982 --> 02:29.858
I insist!

02:29.941 --> 02:31.276
It sounds perfectly barbaric

02:31.359 --> 02:36.489
but if it means that much
to you, permission granted.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.825
I'll have Winston
prepare the guest rooms.

02:38.908 --> 02:41.786
{\an5}And Blake, you may invite
one guest of your own
to spend the night.

02:41.870 --> 02:45.248
Thank you, Mumma!

02:41.870 --> 02:45.248
Hooray!

Will someone get the door?!

Courtney...

03:00.555 --> 03:01.014
Greetings, Ginger!

03:01.097 --> 03:02.932
{\an1}Lois:
Who is it, Ging?

03:03.016 --> 03:05.977
{\an1}Do I need to rinse off
and come down there?

03:06.060 --> 03:07.145
I got it, Mom!

03:07.228 --> 03:08.563
Um, won't you, uh...

03:08.646 --> 03:10.607
{\an1}(<i> Lois singing,</i>
<i>water splashing</i> )

03:10.690 --> 03:12.609
Uh... it's kind of hot
in there.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.445
I'm having a slumber party
this Saturday night

03:15.528 --> 03:16.988
and I want you to attend.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.323
Where's Carl?

03:18.406 --> 03:18.823
I need a word.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.367
Doghouse 'round back.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.953
So, can you come
to my soiree?

03:24.037 --> 03:24.996
{\an1}Wow. I'd love to,
Courtney

03:25.079 --> 03:28.750
but I have to check
with my mom first.

03:28.833 --> 03:29.751
Oh, I'm sure
she'll be thrilled.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.003
But you double-check.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.297
{\an1}Will do.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.465
{\an1}Oh...

03:40.553 --> 03:43.181
Uh... Carl, may I enter?

03:43.264 --> 03:46.100
It's, uh, devilishly
cold out here!

03:46.184 --> 03:49.354
{\an5}Carl:
State the nature
of your business!

03:49.437 --> 03:50.313
I was hoping
you might attend

03:50.396 --> 03:54.359
{\an5}my first annual
sleepover soiree
on Saturday.

03:56.486 --> 04:00.156
Carl? Did you
hear me, I wonder?

04:00.239 --> 04:01.199
I said...

04:01.282 --> 04:02.492
Information received!

04:02.575 --> 04:05.745
I am mulling, do you copy?
Mulling!

04:05.828 --> 04:07.121
We accept.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.752
Oh, so sorry, Woodsey.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.087
I didn't see you there.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.673
I suppose
you'll want to attend?

04:17.757 --> 04:18.675
Nope. I'm busy.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.843
Double drats!

04:20.927 --> 04:24.347
Well, Carl, say about 8:00 then?

04:26.432 --> 04:27.767
What do you mean,
you're busy?

04:27.850 --> 04:30.853
{\an1}You can't make me go,
Carl!

04:30.937 --> 04:33.523
Hoods, when have I ever
made you do anything?

04:33.606 --> 04:35.858
{\an1}Well...

04:35.942 --> 04:37.860
You must accept this invitation
to Courtney's!

04:37.944 --> 04:40.822
I once overheard
that her bedroom

04:40.905 --> 04:42.031
is the ultimate in teen chic.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.034
But I'd be bailing
on you and Macie.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.954
Maybe I'll just catch
Courtney's next slumber party.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.498
Next slumber party?!

04:50.581 --> 04:54.085
There may not be
a next slumber party, fool!

04:55.753 --> 04:57.880
Okay, I'll go.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.842
{\an1}Think of it--
your first adult slumber party.

05:00.925 --> 05:04.012
Dodie, Courtney's our age.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.180
Ginger, Ginger,
Ginger...

05:06.264 --> 05:08.933
{\an1}This is nothing
like our slumber parties.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.687
{\an4}You will be expected
to wear "sleep ensembles,"
not p.j.'s.

05:12.770 --> 05:17.567
{\an4}There will be
sophisticated party games
like you couldn't even imagine.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.569
You might even be expected
to levitate...

05:19.652 --> 05:20.194
What...?

05:20.278 --> 05:23.114
Ooh, we better get cracking!

05:23.197 --> 05:25.158
Call me the minute
your mom says yes

05:25.241 --> 05:26.868
{\an1}and we'll discuss
what to do

05:26.951 --> 05:28.661
about your little
snoring problem.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.373
{\an5}You can always wear
a piece of clear tape
over your nose.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.750
Really works,
trust me.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.668
(<i> gulps</i> )

05:35.752 --> 05:37.295
Oh, yes...

05:37.378 --> 05:40.173
{\an4}Lois:
Of course you can go
to the slumber party.

05:40.256 --> 05:43.009
{\an1}I've been meaning to buy you
a new nightie anyhow.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.054
{\an4}I'll stop at the mall
on the way home from
work tomorrow.

05:46.137 --> 05:46.429
Thanks, Mom.

05:50.349 --> 05:52.518
{\an1}I'll be out Saturday night
as well.

05:52.602 --> 05:53.978
I've been invited
to spend the night

05:54.062 --> 05:55.563
at Blake Gripling's pad.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.566
No...

05:58.649 --> 06:01.444
{\an1}Saves me an extra trip
in the car.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.780
But Mom,
isn't Carl grounded?

06:03.863 --> 06:05.448
I don't think so.

06:05.531 --> 06:05.740
{\an1}Not yet.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.784
{\an1}What for?

06:07.867 --> 06:10.119
You know, that...
bad thing... he did...

06:10.203 --> 06:12.080
No one likes a tattletale,
Ginger.

06:12.163 --> 06:15.124
Besides, Carl knows
he's on thin ice.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.627
But you don't even
like Blake!

06:17.710 --> 06:19.462
He has my petrified eyeball.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.130
There's a score to settle.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.131
{\an1}Carl, for
the hundredth time

06:22.215 --> 06:25.343
{\an1}there are two things
I have asked you

06:25.426 --> 06:27.053
not to discuss
at the table:

06:27.136 --> 06:29.222
{\an1}revenge and
displaced body parts.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.681
You just violated both.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.683
Duly noted.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.602
So, uh, can I go?

06:37.313 --> 06:38.564
(<i> sighs</i> )

06:38.648 --> 06:41.192
I'm coming up empty here, Ging.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.819
You can go.

06:42.902 --> 06:43.986
(<i> chuckles</i> )

06:44.070 --> 06:47.448
Oh, I don't believe it.

06:52.453 --> 06:53.996
Now, hurry on
upstairs.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.124
There's cookies
and milk waiting.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.126
{\an5}Soy milk,
I hope,
Mrs. Bishop.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.752
Hate to be
a nag, but...

06:59.836 --> 07:00.503
I know, dear.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.548
{\an1}We wouldn't want you
swelling again.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.259
(<i> general conversation</i> )

07:06.342 --> 07:08.052
{\an1}My mom read that
last month.

07:08.136 --> 07:11.514
{\an1}The ending's
a real downer!

07:11.597 --> 07:13.349
Okay, I've
compiled a list

07:13.432 --> 07:15.184
of potential
party guests

07:15.268 --> 07:18.354
{\an5}and put their names
and vital information
on flash cards.

07:18.437 --> 07:19.856
Who is this
and what's her nickname?

07:19.939 --> 07:20.982
Melissa Mipson.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.943
{\an1}Her friends
call her Mipsy.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.028
Correct. What is she
best known for?

07:26.112 --> 07:29.240
Faking a cough to get out of
the math final last semester?

07:29.323 --> 07:30.992
Oh, that's second.
Try again.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.202
Her charm ankle bracelet?

07:33.286 --> 07:37.456
{\an1}Yes! And extra points
if you can name the charms.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.459
Um... peace sign...

07:40.543 --> 07:42.211
thorny rose...

07:42.295 --> 07:43.337
dragon.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.215
Ooh, I was looking
for "dragonFLY"

07:46.299 --> 07:49.010
but I'll allow partial credit.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.304
{\an1}So it's really okay
if I don't go to Blake's?

07:51.387 --> 07:53.723
'Cause you know I have
that little problem...

07:53.806 --> 07:54.390
Relax, Hoods.

07:54.473 --> 07:57.226
You're going to the sleepover

07:57.310 --> 08:00.271
but you're not sleeping over.

08:00.354 --> 08:01.397
Oh... good... aah!

08:01.480 --> 08:02.940
You're going to be
a spy.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.234
{\an5}You have to sneak
into Blake's room,
find our eyeball

08:05.318 --> 08:08.237
and return it to
its rightful owner.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.822
{\an1}What are you going
to be doing?

08:09.906 --> 08:11.407
Oh, you know...

08:11.490 --> 08:13.910
suffer through a dozen
Malted Milk Monkeys

08:13.993 --> 08:15.661
{\an1}washed down
with chocolate milk.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.580
{\an1}This looks
a tad small, Hoods.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.916
{\an1}Want me to toss it
in the rag bag?

08:19.999 --> 08:21.250
Courtney:
I had Winston pull

08:21.334 --> 08:22.835
some party-planning materials

08:22.919 --> 08:23.461
from the Internet.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.588
{\an1}"How To Host
A Baby Shower"?

08:25.671 --> 08:27.340
Well, it can't be
that different.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.634
An elegant affair
is an elegant affair.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.928
"My Fifth Birthday Party"?

08:32.010 --> 08:34.304
{\an5}I need to go
consult with Cook
about the menu.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.682
You go through this
list of party games.

08:36.765 --> 08:37.767
Oh, there's an adorable one

08:37.850 --> 08:40.937
that involves the rear end
of a donkey! (<i> giggles</i> )

08:41.020 --> 08:43.981
I can't believe it.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.608
Excellent, Ginger.

08:45.691 --> 08:49.278
{\an5}Now let's move on to
the do's and don'ts
of Truth or Dare.

08:49.362 --> 08:49.779
Both:
Ooh....

08:49.862 --> 08:51.697
{\an1}Oh, no...

08:53.699 --> 08:57.995
Ha-ha! I knew my excavation
would bear fruits.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.957
Carl... what are you
doing with that?

09:01.040 --> 09:01.958
This is our secret weapon.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.877
I unleash this in Blake's room,
he clears out

09:04.961 --> 09:06.837
you sneak in
and steal the eyeball.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.006
{\an1}But Carl, we aren't
supposed to open

09:09.090 --> 09:12.009
{\an1}The Moldy Rotten Eggs
until freshman year, remember?

09:12.093 --> 09:12.969
Two years ago you said that.

09:13.052 --> 09:13.970
Desperate times.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.097
We better test it.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.015
See if it's got
the stink power yet.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.558
Carl, no, I beg you.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.018
Let's take it outside!

09:21.102 --> 09:23.604
Or maybe we should open it
underground... yeah!

09:23.688 --> 09:25.523
(<i> hissing</i> )

09:26.565 --> 09:29.193
(<i> girls scream and groan...</i> )

09:29.277 --> 09:30.528
(<i> door slams</i> )

09:30.611 --> 09:32.488
...but she just mopes
all the time.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.157
I know she's trapped
in a loveless marriage

09:35.241 --> 09:36.993
in 19th-century France,
but rea...

09:37.076 --> 09:38.744
(<i> sniffing</i> )

09:38.828 --> 09:40.121
Oh, my...

09:40.204 --> 09:42.665
(<i> all gasp and groan</i> )

09:42.748 --> 09:46.294
(<i> screaming and groaning...</i> )

09:47.128 --> 09:50.506
(<i> screaming...</i> )

09:50.589 --> 09:51.591
Wait, oh, wait!

09:51.674 --> 09:53.009
Oh, please, oh, come back!

09:53.092 --> 09:54.510
I'm sure it will pass!

09:54.593 --> 09:55.678
(<i> coughing...</i> )

09:55.761 --> 09:57.930
{\an1}Carl:
'Kay, how about this:

09:58.014 --> 09:58.723
I'm grounded for two weeks

09:58.806 --> 10:01.058
{\an1}beginning the day
after the sleepover.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.518
{\an1}That's my final offer,
Mom.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.395
Carl, it's going to be
hard to forget

10:04.478 --> 10:06.230
the sight of
JoAnn Bishop sobbing.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.275
{\an5}Do you know she's kept
that book club going
for ten years?

10:09.358 --> 10:11.944
And my Moldy Rotten Eggs
wiped them out

10:12.028 --> 10:14.030
with one twist of a jar lid...

10:14.113 --> 10:16.657
{\an5}And stunk up her
precious knickknacks
to boot.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.534
So you're grounded
as of tonight

10:18.617 --> 10:19.118
and that's
the end of it.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.620
And Ginger,
I'm, I'm sorry

10:20.703 --> 10:24.373
{\an5}but you're going to
have to miss your
slumber party.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.250
Me? Why?

10:26.334 --> 10:29.462
{\an5}I took the late shift
thinking you'd both
be out all night.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.422
There's no one
to babysit Carl.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.550
I can't thank you guys enough

10:34.633 --> 10:35.551
for watching Carl for me.

10:35.634 --> 10:39.138
Have fun sleeping over...
without me.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.390
{\an1}Your mom is
coming back, right?

10:41.474 --> 10:42.808
She'll be home at 11:00.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.895
{\an1}Just don't let your guard down,
even for a second.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.730
Emergency numbers
are by the phone.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.357
They know him at the hospital.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.608
It's already 8:05.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.402
You know you're expected
to be on time

10:53.486 --> 10:54.862
for a slumber party.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.948
Oh, Ginger, you're going
to Courtney Gripling's

10:58.032 --> 10:59.700
first annual slumber party!

10:59.784 --> 11:01.077
I just got the chills.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.036
{\an1}Me, too.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.454
Me, three.

11:03.537 --> 11:06.707
Unless that's a cold
coming on...

11:11.796 --> 11:13.673
Your mission has
increased twofold.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.674
You not only have to
secure the missing eyeball

11:15.758 --> 11:19.512
but you must also take
my place at the sleepover.

11:19.595 --> 11:23.891
{\an5}But Carl, sleeping over
at a stranger's house
makes me nervous.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.394
And you know what happens
when I get nervous...

11:26.477 --> 11:29.271
Lots of kids wet
the bed, Hoods.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.273
But I've got
a foolproof plan.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.401
You'll be wearing
the Carl-Cam.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.986
I'll be able to watch
your every move.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.113
Oh, great.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.448
Now I'm really nervous.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.117
Maude's old hearing aid.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.370
I've rigged it so you can hear
everything I say.

11:44.453 --> 11:44.745
Here, try it on.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.542
I still don't see how this...

11:49.625 --> 11:50.209
(<i> echoing</i> ):
Testing...

11:50.292 --> 11:52.420
Mayday! (<i> feedback</i> )

11:52.503 --> 11:53.754
(<i> gasps</i> )

11:53.838 --> 11:56.465
{\an1}But Carl, what are we
going to do

11:56.549 --> 11:59.760
about my, you know,
sleepover problem?

11:59.844 --> 12:02.805
Two words:
liquid... deprivation.

12:02.888 --> 12:06.183
I'm not sure I like
the way that sounds.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.810
What does it mean?

12:07.893 --> 12:10.396
{\an1}It means no drinking
between now and the party.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.480
And I'm thinking
no eating either.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.858
The two go hand in hand,
don't you think?

12:25.953 --> 12:28.372
(<i> sighs</i> )

12:29.748 --> 12:30.791
(<i> gasps</i> )

12:30.875 --> 12:32.960
{\an1}Ginger? What are you
doing here?

12:33.043 --> 12:35.671
I was invited, wasn't I?

12:35.754 --> 12:38.007
Yes, but it's 8:15.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.342
You said the party
started at 8:00.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.845
You actually came
on time?

12:42.928 --> 12:44.847
Oh, that's priceless.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.640
(<i> both laughing...</i> )

12:48.601 --> 12:52.855
Computerized female voice:
Welcome to Courtney's room!

12:52.938 --> 12:54.815
She's glad you're here!

12:54.899 --> 12:56.484
Make yourself at home!

12:56.567 --> 13:00.196
{\an1}So, what do you think
about my boudoir?

13:00.279 --> 13:01.530
Oh, it's amazing, Courtney.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.201
I heard you had
talking furniture

13:05.284 --> 13:07.411
but I didn't know
about the faux fur.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.372
Thanks. Glad you like.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.082
Isn't it too too?

13:12.166 --> 13:16.754
It's all great, but, um, where
is everyone going to sleep?

13:16.837 --> 13:19.882
(<i> laughs</i> ) On the floor of
the guest rooms, of course.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.884
Don't you know anything
about slumber parties?

13:25.721 --> 13:28.140
Computer voice:
Perfect, Courtney.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.058
Don't change a thing!

13:29.141 --> 13:32.061
It's just at the slumber
parties I've been to

13:32.144 --> 13:33.729
everyone sleeps
in the same room.

13:33.812 --> 13:36.524
This is a different kind
of slumber party, Ginger.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.192
{\an1}It's much more...
independent.

13:38.275 --> 13:41.195
No, Miranda-- we have to follow
Ginger's lead on this one.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.405
She's the expert.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.574
Well, I have hosted
a few in my day.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.909
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

13:46.992 --> 13:49.328
Oh, why are these girls
arriving on time?!

13:49.411 --> 13:51.664
Don't they know
the fashionably late rule?

13:51.747 --> 13:52.414
{\an1}Actually,
at a slumber party

13:52.498 --> 13:55.084
{\an1}you want to maximize
your time

13:55.167 --> 13:57.753
{\an1}so you can get in
plenty of the three S's.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.423
Songs, stories, snacks?

14:01.507 --> 14:03.384
Miranda, stall the guests.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.511
Ginger, help me clear
the furniture

14:05.594 --> 14:07.346
while you tell me
all about these S's.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.015
Go. Go, go, go, go!

14:14.812 --> 14:16.021
Where's Courtney?

14:16.105 --> 14:18.524
{\an4}I can't wait to see
what she's done to her room!

14:18.607 --> 14:19.733
I brought fudge!

14:19.817 --> 14:21.068
(<i> shudders</i> )

14:23.362 --> 14:24.321
(<i> rings doorbell</i> )

14:24.405 --> 14:26.282
(<i> sighs</i> )

14:26.365 --> 14:28.325
Ah! Carl, my ma...

14:28.409 --> 14:31.620
Woodsey?
What are you doing here?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.038
Carl got grounded.

14:33.122 --> 14:33.664
He sent me instead.

14:33.747 --> 14:37.626
Oh, it's hardly the same...

14:37.710 --> 14:41.422
Let's just play, sleep,
and get it over with.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.891
Yes! We're in!

15:00.566 --> 15:02.610
{\an1}Girls, do you know
Ginger Foutley?

15:02.693 --> 15:03.861
Ginger, this is...

15:03.944 --> 15:06.780
Traci "the Tracinator"
Lefferts

15:06.864 --> 15:08.157
Heather "Cuddles" Woods

15:08.240 --> 15:09.491
Lonnie Considine

15:09.575 --> 15:12.745
and of course,
"Mipsy" Mipson.

15:12.828 --> 15:13.537
Nice to meet all of you.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.248
Where have I
seen you before?

15:16.332 --> 15:19.418
I sat behind you in math
all through elementary...

15:19.501 --> 15:21.670
Anyone up for Sloppy Janes?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.505
Hmm... I'm not familiar
with that game.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.591
No. See, they're...

15:25.674 --> 15:27.801
Too much slop, Dodie.

15:27.885 --> 15:31.013
{\an1}Where is your head,
young lady?

15:31.096 --> 15:33.432
I wonder if Courtney
really has a canopy bed

15:33.515 --> 15:34.725
and matching
end tables

15:34.808 --> 15:36.518
with rhinestone
drawer pulls...

15:36.602 --> 15:37.853
Don't you worry.

15:37.936 --> 15:40.481
{\an1}Ginger will report
every detail.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.108
Oh, it's going to be
a long night.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.151
{\an1}Speaking of which,
where's Carl?

15:44.234 --> 15:46.862
{\an1}I haven't seen him since
we burned that tick off him.

15:46.945 --> 15:50.491
{\an5}Can't we just pretend
he's sound asleep
in his bed?

15:50.574 --> 15:51.992
We're babysitters, Macie.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.744
{\an1}It's our job to know
where he is.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.163
{\an1}Here, Carl, here, boy!
(<i> kissing</i> )

15:56.246 --> 15:59.458
Slipped right through our
fingers, did you, hot foot?

16:00.292 --> 16:04.630
Blake:
Please put that back, Woodsey.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.840
Ah! I have an idea!

16:06.924 --> 16:10.552
Let's spy on my sister's party!

16:10.636 --> 16:11.595
No!

16:11.679 --> 16:12.888
Hoodsey:
Okay, sure.

16:12.971 --> 16:14.056
Stay focused!

16:14.139 --> 16:15.224
Think eyeball!

16:18.352 --> 16:19.520
(<i> cans rattle</i> )

16:19.603 --> 16:20.896
Intruders!

16:20.979 --> 16:22.231
Inside, Carl.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.358
{\an1}And don't make us do
anything rash.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.819
(<i> gasps</i> )
It's Ginger!

16:26.902 --> 16:29.279
In Courtney's room!

16:29.363 --> 16:31.198
{\an1}I'm actually
seeing it!

16:31.281 --> 16:34.785
{\an1}There's, oh,
there's faux fur everywhere!

16:34.868 --> 16:39.039
Oh, Macie, it's better
than I dreamed!

16:39.123 --> 16:40.082
Root beer, ladies?

16:43.711 --> 16:45.963
The game is Truth or Dare.

16:46.046 --> 16:50.008
What do you say we start with...
Ginger?

16:50.092 --> 16:53.971
Uh... okay... truth.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.098
All:
(<i> gasp</i> ) Truth...?

16:56.181 --> 16:59.893
Okay... what is your
deepest, darkest secret

16:59.977 --> 17:03.605
that nobody in the whole
wide world knows?

17:03.689 --> 17:05.898
I can't tell you that.

17:05.983 --> 17:06.983
You picked truth.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.152
{\an1}That means you answer
the question.

17:11.488 --> 17:12.030
No, no, no, no!

17:12.114 --> 17:14.366
Not your hairy legs,
Ginger!

17:15.909 --> 17:22.124
Okay... my deepest,
darkest secret is...

17:22.207 --> 17:24.917
I've had this monster crush
on Ian Richton

17:25.002 --> 17:26.127
since the third grade.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.005
(<i> all exclaim</i> )

17:28.088 --> 17:29.757
{\an1}Wow...
I just would have lied.

17:29.840 --> 17:30.799
Both:
Oh...

17:30.883 --> 17:33.135
Mission Control to Hoodsey!

17:33.218 --> 17:37.097
Get out of that girl party
and get the eyeball!

17:43.896 --> 17:46.899
Who does this belong to?

17:46.982 --> 17:48.150
Ginger?!

17:48.233 --> 17:51.695
I'd never wear black
with peach, Miranda.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.113
(<i> all laugh</i> )

17:56.074 --> 17:59.870
{\an5}All chant:
Light as a feather,
stiff as a board.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.914
Rise, body, rise!

18:01.997 --> 18:04.875
I can't believe this!

18:04.958 --> 18:06.251
Neither can I!

18:06.335 --> 18:08.253
You really trust us!

18:08.337 --> 18:08.837
Aah! Ow...

18:08.921 --> 18:11.882
Oh, that's got to hurt.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.259
Hoodsey!
I've lost visual contact!

18:14.343 --> 18:16.428
Repeat: I can no longer see you!

18:16.512 --> 18:18.013
(<i> gasps</i> )

18:18.096 --> 18:18.972
Silly me.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.016
I forgot the whipped cream.

18:21.099 --> 18:22.351
Back in a flash.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.229
Carl? He made hot chocolate!

18:25.312 --> 18:28.023
I don't think I can resist!

18:28.106 --> 18:30.567
No, no, no!
Don't drink it!

18:30.651 --> 18:32.236
You're on liquid
deprivation

18:32.319 --> 18:34.613
and you still have to
get the eyeball!

18:34.696 --> 18:36.240
But I'm really thirsty!

18:38.617 --> 18:39.868
(<i> gasps</i> )

18:39.952 --> 18:42.371
It's the eyeball-- I got it!

18:42.454 --> 18:43.622
Good job, Hoodsey!

18:43.705 --> 18:45.499
Now get out of there!

18:45.582 --> 18:47.376
But what about the sleepover?

18:47.459 --> 18:48.710
Forget it.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.213
Come home, boy, come home.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.048
Blake:
Woodsey, we're in luck.

18:53.131 --> 18:56.051
Cook left us some chicken
cordon bleu in the fridge.

18:56.134 --> 18:59.263
No...!

18:59.346 --> 19:02.432
She tried to start the car,
but she was out of gas.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.518
Then a deep voice says

19:04.601 --> 19:06.854
(<i> imitating</i> ):
"Can I give you a hand?"

19:06.937 --> 19:10.315
And with that, a severed hand
came flying in the window--

19:10.399 --> 19:13.235
with her boyfriend's
class ring on the finger!

19:13.318 --> 19:14.570
(<i> girls screaming</i> )

19:14.653 --> 19:16.405
{\an1}Lois:
Dodie, Macie! Carl!

19:16.488 --> 19:17.614
You kids still up?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.783
Why are all the lights out?

19:19.867 --> 19:23.579
Mrs. Foutley!
The jig is up!

19:23.662 --> 19:24.830
{\an1}Just when it was
getting good!

19:24.913 --> 19:27.416
{\an1}Lois:
Where is everyone?

19:27.499 --> 19:31.712
(<i> gulping and slurping...</i> )

19:31.795 --> 19:32.880
Huh?

19:32.963 --> 19:34.256
(<i> Miranda snickering</i> )

19:36.008 --> 19:39.094
Miranda:
You sure this is going to work?

19:39.177 --> 19:41.555
{\an5}Mipsy:
Promise. Ginger won't know
what hit her.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.433
{\an5}How did you learn
that you can make
someone wet the bed

19:44.516 --> 19:46.143
by putting their
fingers in water?

19:46.226 --> 19:48.478
{\an1}It's wonderfully
diabolical.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.773
{\an4}Later we can put her bra
in the freezer.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.650
Like she wears a bra.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.320
{\an5}Ooh, you're so bad.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.613
(<i> both laughing</i> )

20:13.921 --> 20:14.630
Oh...

20:14.713 --> 20:18.008
(<i> gulping</i> )

20:18.091 --> 20:21.428
(<i> yawning...</i> )

20:24.723 --> 20:26.350
(<i> snoring</i> )

20:28.560 --> 20:29.937
Girl:
(<i> gasps</i> ) Bed-wetter!

20:30.020 --> 20:31.813
Girls chanting:
Bed-wetter...

20:31.897 --> 20:34.691
Bed-wetter... bed-wetter...
bed-wetter...

20:34.775 --> 20:36.234
Bed-wetter...
bed-wetter...

20:36.318 --> 20:38.737
{\an5}bed-wetter...
bed-wetter...
bed-wetter...

20:38.820 --> 20:39.696
bed-wetter...
bed-wetter...

20:39.780 --> 20:42.032
Bed-wetter...

20:42.115 --> 20:46.662
Eww... Courtney's
fluffy white carpet!

20:46.745 --> 20:48.580
My tartan bathrobe!

20:48.664 --> 20:52.417
My slumber party! Ruined!

20:52.501 --> 20:55.003
(<i> gasping...</i> )

20:55.087 --> 20:58.423
No! Not Princess!

20:58.507 --> 21:00.634
Just get out!

21:00.717 --> 21:01.385
{\an1}Don't you think
you guys

21:01.468 --> 21:03.929
{\an1}are being kind of tough
on the kid?

21:04.012 --> 21:06.431
{\an1}He just had a little
too much to drink.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.349
That's more than

21:07.432 --> 21:09.184
a little too much to drink.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.521
Truth or Dare, Courtney?

21:12.604 --> 21:13.689
Now is not the time
for party games.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.650
Fine. Be a chicken.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.068
(<i> laughs</i> )

21:18.151 --> 21:19.319
Okay. Truth.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.698
Didn't you ever wet the bed
when you were younger?

21:22.781 --> 21:23.782
Even just once?

21:23.865 --> 21:26.535
(<i> all gasp</i> )

21:26.618 --> 21:27.786
Of course not.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.413
It's disgusting.

21:29.496 --> 21:33.291
You know, if you're not
going to tell the truth

21:33.375 --> 21:36.044
{\an1}you might just
want to say "dare".

21:36.128 --> 21:38.088
Come on, Hoodsey.

21:40.007 --> 21:43.719
Ginger Foutley
is so history.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.804
Did you see me leading
the conga line?

21:45.887 --> 21:48.724
That was my favorite part.

21:48.807 --> 21:52.310
Especially when you ribbed
Mipsy in the tummy.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.895
(<i> laughs</i> )

21:53.979 --> 21:56.023
You're my hero.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.191
Oh, Hoodsey was the hero.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.234
Yeah, Hoodsey.

21:59.317 --> 22:01.111
You saved me from
Miranda's trick.

22:01.194 --> 22:02.446
{\an3}Thanks.

22:02.529 --> 22:04.740
I guess I did okay,
after all, huh, Carl?

22:04.823 --> 22:09.244
Okay? And you stole back the
eyeball from that weasel Blake

22:09.327 --> 22:14.332
and left your mark
right in Courtney's doorway!

22:14.416 --> 22:17.711
Oh, revenge doesn't get
any sweeter than that.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.797
{\an1}Oh, Carl, how many times
do I have to tell you?

22:20.881 --> 22:23.091
{\an1}No discussion of
displaced body parts

22:23.175 --> 22:25.343
{\an1}and plots of revenge
at the table!

22:25.427 --> 22:27.512
Ginger:
<i>And speaking of payback</i>

22:27.596 --> 22:31.516
<i>Carl's not the only Foutley</i>
<i>who can pull off a prank.</i>

22:31.600 --> 22:33.560
<i>On the way out of Courtney's</i>

22:33.643 --> 22:36.271
<i>Hoodsey and I made</i>
<i>a little stop in the kitchen.</i>

22:36.354 --> 22:39.941
<i>I sure hope Courtney</i>
<i>has a sense of humor...</i>

22:40.025 --> 22:41.276
<i>'cause it will come in</i>
<i>kind of handy</i>

22:41.359 --> 22:45.113
<i>when she finds that bra of hers</i>
<i>in the freezer.</i>

22:45.197 --> 22:46.448
