01:27.384 --> 01:28.758
Action, Jake.

01:32.824 --> 01:36.206
Cut.
Look, what's the problem here?

01:36.280 --> 01:40.917
Remember, I want you to open the coffin
a beat after you open your eyes.

01:40.983 --> 01:43.350
Get him out of here!
Come on! Raise the camera!

01:43.415 --> 01:45.073
Joe, give me a hand.
Something's the matter with him.

01:45.143 --> 01:47.478
That's all right, Jake.
Just relax.

01:47.544 --> 01:50.359
We got you. Something's going on.
Something's weird.

01:50.424 --> 01:52.758
- Are you okay, babe?
- Give him some air.

01:52.823 --> 01:55.693
What's the matter? Speak to me.
Come on, talk.

01:55.768 --> 01:57.710
What's the matter?

01:57.783 --> 02:01.079
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

02:01.143 --> 02:04.438
I was in the coffin. I closed my eyes.
I thought everything would be okay.

02:04.503 --> 02:06.892
I opened my eyes, and the camera
was right on top of me...

02:06.967 --> 02:09.553
and I couldn't move.

02:09.624 --> 02:11.631
It's no big thing.
I just...

02:11.703 --> 02:14.670
For a second there,
I just couldn't move.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.750
I don't know what happened.
I'm sorry.

02:16.823 --> 02:18.514
Fire!

02:18.583 --> 02:20.438
No! What happened?

02:20.503 --> 02:24.115
Get up there!
Put some water on it!

02:26.744 --> 02:29.231
This is great.
That's terrific.

02:29.303 --> 02:30.678
You got it under control?

02:32.343 --> 02:37.078
Look, Jake,
you really look exhausted, babe.

02:37.143 --> 02:40.755
Why don't you take a shower
and go on home. We lost the sun.

02:40.823 --> 02:42.995
Let me try it one more time.
I can do it.

02:43.064 --> 02:46.577
I know you can,
but we don't have any sun anymore.

03:19.223 --> 03:22.191
Can I have nuts with that
and a Manhattan?

03:22.263 --> 03:23.638
- Yeah.
- And fries.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.077
- Right.
- Rings.

03:25.143 --> 03:28.591
- Anything to drink?
- Two large Cokes with ice.

03:28.663 --> 03:31.630
Onions on everything.

03:31.703 --> 03:33.711
- That to go?
- Yeah.

03:33.783 --> 03:35.955
4.99.

03:36.024 --> 03:37.398
Keep the change.

03:38.904 --> 03:40.431
You too.
See you guys.

05:43.223 --> 05:47.314
- Scully, how's that picture coming?
- Good. Fine.

05:47.383 --> 05:50.351
- Great.
- I'll have a Jack Daniels, neat.

05:50.424 --> 05:53.391
Are you serious?
You quit drinking. Remember?

05:53.463 --> 05:55.318
Just get the drink, Doug.

05:56.663 --> 05:58.354
What's the matter?

05:58.423 --> 06:00.430
They cut your big scene?

06:08.727 --> 06:10.101
Again.

06:24.119 --> 06:25.494
Carol?

06:29.143 --> 06:31.030
I thought you were a bartender,
not a priest.

06:32.503 --> 06:34.096
That's right.
I'm a bartender.

06:34.167 --> 06:36.469
Then keep the fucking glass filled.

06:39.384 --> 06:41.238
Keep your own glass filled.

06:42.743 --> 06:46.671
- I'm sorry.
- That's cool.

06:46.743 --> 06:49.231
Just don't pay any attention to me.

06:49.303 --> 06:50.677
l...

06:56.567 --> 06:57.941
You need a place to stay?

07:00.343 --> 07:01.718
Yeah, I guess I do.

08:31.351 --> 08:33.010
What are you doing here?
I thought you were working.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.933
I am. I got a week off.

08:34.999 --> 08:37.235
I figured I'd go
to some interviews, stay busy.

08:37.303 --> 08:41.231
- Great.
- Do you know about any sublets?

08:41.303 --> 08:43.953
- I'II check around.
- Something available immediately.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.991
- Not offhand.
- What... Ho!

08:47.063 --> 08:49.714
The whole world's here.
You two know each other?

08:49.783 --> 08:52.434
- Jake Scully, Sam Bouchard.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

08:52.503 --> 08:54.837
- Right here.
- I'll see you in class later.

08:54.903 --> 08:57.390
- We got class today?
- At 3:00.

08:57.463 --> 08:59.830
- Right.
- Good luck.

08:59.895 --> 09:02.034
What have you been doing lately?

09:02.103 --> 09:05.715
I just started a low-budget,
independent horror film.

09:05.783 --> 09:08.434
'Vampire's Kiss."
I play the vampire.

09:10.263 --> 09:12.434
Sounds interesting.

09:12.503 --> 09:15.470
Before that I did Petruchio
in 'Taming of the Shrew."

09:15.543 --> 09:17.234
Anything else?

09:19.223 --> 09:21.230
You mean anything good?

09:21.303 --> 09:22.994
You are working.

09:23.063 --> 09:27.373
- That's good now, isn't it?
- Yeah.

09:39.703 --> 09:42.518
- Hi. Small town.
- Yeah.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.234
- Jack Scully.
- Jake.

09:45.303 --> 09:46.677
Give them hell.

09:49.303 --> 09:50.677
Hello.

10:05.207 --> 10:08.022
I remember that it was dark.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.157
Really black.

10:11.223 --> 10:14.671
I was just a little kid.

10:14.743 --> 10:18.517
And the wall behind me was cold.

10:20.023 --> 10:21.550
And damp.

10:21.623 --> 10:23.314
I was hiding. I was...

10:23.383 --> 10:25.073
Oh, yeah.

10:25.143 --> 10:27.150
I was part of this game: Sardine.

10:27.223 --> 10:29.710
I was it, and I was hiding.

10:30.743 --> 10:33.231
Everybody was looking for me.

10:33.303 --> 10:36.598
And there was humming.

10:36.662 --> 10:38.834
I was behind the freezer
in the basement.

10:41.783 --> 10:45.711
And I had jammed myself in
so hard behind the freezer...

10:45.783 --> 10:48.500
that I couldn't move.

10:52.343 --> 10:54.350
I'm afraid.

10:54.423 --> 10:58.198
Uh-huh.
What are you afraid of?

11:00.439 --> 11:01.813
They're not gonna find me.

11:01.911 --> 11:05.206
But they're not supposed
to find you.

11:05.271 --> 11:07.758
But I'm afraid
because I can't move.

11:09.751 --> 11:11.312
Why don't you cry out?

11:13.463 --> 11:15.470
I can't. I'm afraid.

11:17.143 --> 11:20.754
Besides, I'm the sardine.
They're not supposed to find me.

11:20.822 --> 11:23.473
Now particularize that.

11:23.543 --> 11:24.918
Who can't find you?

11:24.983 --> 11:27.885
My brothers.
They're bigger than me.

11:30.263 --> 11:31.954
First time
they ever let me play.

11:32.023 --> 11:34.194
If they're your brothers,
they'll want to help you, right?

11:34.262 --> 11:37.077
No. They won't let me play again.

11:37.142 --> 11:40.077
- They're bigger than you are.
- Yeah.

11:41.111 --> 11:43.151
Will they hurt you?

11:43.223 --> 11:44.597
Yes.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.834
How?

11:46.903 --> 11:49.074
They'll laugh at me for getting stuck
behind the freezer...

11:49.143 --> 11:50.572
and for crying out for help.

11:51.863 --> 11:54.514
The big baby.

11:54.583 --> 11:55.957
That's right.

11:57.623 --> 11:59.957
You are a baby.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.677
I know.

12:02.743 --> 12:06.518
Yeah, and you're afraid.

12:06.583 --> 12:07.957
Yeah.

12:10.423 --> 12:12.278
You must act.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.917
I can't. I'm afraid.

12:20.983 --> 12:23.088
- You'll never escape.
- I know.

12:24.503 --> 12:25.877
You'll die.

12:27.062 --> 12:28.437
Yeah.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.794
Bullshit!

12:31.862 --> 12:33.717
You've got to act!

12:34.903 --> 12:36.309
Fuck the fear.

12:38.423 --> 12:40.757
You've got to cry out for help!
Come on!

12:40.823 --> 12:42.677
Use your body!
Cry for help!

12:45.015 --> 12:46.389
You can do it.

12:49.303 --> 12:52.052
I want you to cry out.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.548
I can't. I'm a sardine.

12:55.063 --> 12:56.491
Sardines in a can are dead.

12:56.566 --> 12:58.671
They can't feel.
They can't be afraid.

12:58.742 --> 13:01.263
But you're alive and afraid.

13:01.335 --> 13:03.309
You're not a goddamn dead sardine!

13:04.343 --> 13:06.198
- This is crap.
- Dig down deep!

13:08.407 --> 13:09.781
Cry out!

13:14.583 --> 13:17.266
- I can't.
- Come on.

13:17.334 --> 13:19.058
Leave the guy alone.

13:19.191 --> 13:21.973
Do not interrupt this exercise.

13:22.038 --> 13:24.821
This looks like
a mind-fuck to me.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.953
What is your name? You're not
a member of this class, are you?

13:29.206 --> 13:31.061
That's right. I'm not.

13:31.126 --> 13:33.712
I thought this was a class for acting,
not humiliation.

13:36.182 --> 13:39.728
What gives you the right
to fuck around with this guy's head?

13:42.294 --> 13:45.872
- I think you better leave.
- I think that's a good idea.

13:46.807 --> 13:48.912
I want to act.
Come on.

13:48.983 --> 13:52.812
Class is out.
Come on. Let's go.

13:52.887 --> 13:54.261
I'm sorry, Will.

13:55.286 --> 13:56.661
I can't do this today.

13:58.647 --> 14:00.818
This is called an exit.

14:06.007 --> 14:07.381
Shit.

14:09.655 --> 14:11.695
What a fool I am.

14:12.727 --> 14:15.694
You're too hard on yourself.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.898
Some of these guys
can't get a job.

14:18.967 --> 14:21.455
They put an ad in the trade.
They call themselves teachers.

14:21.527 --> 14:25.934
What do they teach us?
How to be more fucked up than we are.

14:26.006 --> 14:27.381
That's not it.

14:33.686 --> 14:35.955
- Can we get another round?
- Coming up.

14:42.422 --> 14:44.789
- Thanks.
- Check.

14:44.854 --> 14:46.709
Are you married?

14:50.487 --> 14:51.861
Separated.

14:52.886 --> 14:55.636
Me too, as of yesterday.

14:55.703 --> 15:00.492
We weren't married,
but it was almost the same thing.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.941
What happened?

15:04.695 --> 15:06.735
I'm sorry.
That's none of my business.

15:06.807 --> 15:08.662
That's okay.
It's just...

15:10.006 --> 15:11.697
Sounds so stupid.

15:14.006 --> 15:15.697
These things usually do.

15:17.846 --> 15:20.432
Caught her in bed
with another guy.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.997
Can you believe that?

15:22.071 --> 15:23.445
Man.

15:24.470 --> 15:25.932
You had no idea?

15:29.655 --> 15:31.029
None.

15:33.206 --> 15:35.061
Christ, I keep seeing it.

15:38.806 --> 15:40.497
Carol lying there.

15:43.606 --> 15:45.297
Her face was glowing.

15:47.927 --> 15:51.636
- Her face was glowing?
- Yeah.

15:52.662 --> 15:55.477
How do you get
a girl's face to glow?

15:55.542 --> 15:56.971
I got 16 years of good humping.

15:57.046 --> 16:01.301
Not once did I get a glimmer,
let alone a fucking glow.

16:01.367 --> 16:02.741
Glowing?

16:05.527 --> 16:09.139
- I'm sorry. That's tough.
- No, you're right.

16:09.207 --> 16:11.378
It's not that big a deal, really.

16:11.446 --> 16:13.934
- You kicked the bitch out I hope.
- I didn't.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.494
- Why not?
- It was her place.

16:24.246 --> 16:26.254
You've been through the shitter.

16:27.607 --> 16:31.382
- Where are you staying?
- I got a friend with a floor.

16:39.446 --> 16:41.301
You ready for some good news?

16:41.366 --> 16:43.373
Yeah.

16:43.446 --> 16:45.454
I got this five-week gig coming up.

16:45.527 --> 16:47.698
Seattle Rep's doing a revival
of 'Private Lives."

16:47.767 --> 16:49.774
I've been house-sitting
for a friend.

16:49.846 --> 16:53.294
- He gives me a good deal on the place...
- I've been looking for a sublet.

16:53.367 --> 16:56.181
- Would this be available right away?
- Wait here.

16:56.247 --> 16:58.897
Let me make a phone call.
Don't move.

17:02.007 --> 17:04.973
- Do you like plants?
- Sure.

17:09.814 --> 17:12.880
- I can't believe this.
- It's something, isn't it?

17:17.207 --> 17:19.060
Be if ever so humble.

17:20.247 --> 17:23.791
- This is unbelievable.
- I know it's not much.

17:23.862 --> 17:26.896
- Can you handle this?
- I've never seen anything like it.

17:26.967 --> 17:29.781
- Your friend must really be loaded.
- He's filthy with the stuff.

17:29.847 --> 17:34.102
Anyway, here they are.
Water them every day after 6:00.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.173
- Right.
- You got it?

17:36.246 --> 17:39.542
- That's it.
- Listen, this is really nice of you.

17:39.607 --> 17:42.738
No thanks necessary.
One struggling actor helping another.

17:42.806 --> 17:44.497
- That's what it's all about.
- Thank you.

17:44.566 --> 17:47.381
- Just don't let the damn plants die.
- You got it.

17:47.446 --> 17:50.097
- Where is he anyway?
- Alan?

17:50.167 --> 17:52.338
- Yeah.
- He spends a lot of time in Europe.

17:52.406 --> 17:54.740
I got a well-stocked bar.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.814
- Rotating bed.
- "Rotating"?

17:56.887 --> 18:00.662
Sauna and Jacuzzi in the back
just beyond the walk-in closets.

18:00.727 --> 18:02.996
As soon as I pack up,
you can put your stuff away.

18:03.062 --> 18:05.451
- Are you leaving now?
- Yeah, l...

18:08.407 --> 18:11.058
The hell with it.
I got time for one more drink.

18:11.127 --> 18:13.777
I'll still be able
to catch the last flight.

18:14.967 --> 18:17.781
What a setup.
This is great.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.221
Isn't it?

18:22.807 --> 18:24.662
Thank you.

18:24.727 --> 18:27.061
- Sam, here's to a friendship...
- Wait.

18:29.686 --> 18:31.541
Let's do this right.
Come here.

18:37.526 --> 18:38.900
To Hollywood.

18:38.967 --> 18:40.341
Yeah.

18:44.406 --> 18:46.097
What a view.

18:47.767 --> 18:50.254
That's just part of it.

18:50.326 --> 18:55.061
There is one very special feature
to this house.

18:57.046 --> 18:59.054
- What are you looking at?
- Where are you?

19:03.606 --> 19:05.908
There she is.

19:07.767 --> 19:09.141
Show time.

19:14.966 --> 19:16.973
I'd like you to meet
my favorite neighbor.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.285
- See her?
- Whoa.

19:26.806 --> 19:28.181
It gets better.

19:31.606 --> 19:33.941
- What's she doing?
- Just keep watching. You'll see.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.689
- You want to get a little closer?
- You bet.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.377
- Oh, my God.
- Focused?

19:39.447 --> 19:43.789
- She's a little out of focus. Yes!
- Yes? Hang on.

19:46.327 --> 19:47.701
Does she do this a lot?

19:47.766 --> 19:49.773
Like clockwork, every night.

21:31.062 --> 21:32.437
Jesus.

22:28.726 --> 22:30.100
What do you think?

22:34.006 --> 22:36.046
- It's something, isn't it?
- Yeah.

22:36.118 --> 22:38.093
Lady does the same gig every night.

22:38.167 --> 22:40.654
Did you get a look at her face?

22:40.726 --> 22:43.955
Too bad. She is gorgeous.
Shit.

22:44.022 --> 22:46.095
- I gotta get going.
- Can I help you?

22:46.166 --> 22:47.540
All right.

22:47.606 --> 22:49.297
Don't forget your scarf.

22:51.126 --> 22:52.653
Here's the key.

22:52.726 --> 22:55.060
Try not to make too many
long-distance phone calls.

22:55.126 --> 22:56.817
Thanks again.
This is good of you.

22:56.886 --> 22:58.577
- You're doing me a favor too.
- Thank you.

22:58.646 --> 23:01.461
- Take it easy.
- Knock 'em dead!

23:01.526 --> 23:03.860
They're already dead in Seattle.

23:03.926 --> 23:05.301
So long.

23:12.983 --> 23:14.576
My, my

23:14.646 --> 23:16.021
Uh-oh

23:16.086 --> 23:19.698
The house is burning
but there's no one home

24:51.702 --> 24:53.077
Jesus!

25:03.382 --> 25:04.789
Bastard.

25:35.382 --> 25:38.197
Where the hell have you been?
I've been calling you all over town.

25:38.262 --> 25:41.393
I'm sorry, Frank. I've been having
some real problems with Carol.

25:41.462 --> 25:43.851
I've been staying
at a friend's house.

25:43.926 --> 25:46.675
You got a few more problems.
Rubin fired you.

25:46.774 --> 25:49.774
- What?
- You don’t have a job anymore.

25:49.846 --> 25:51.788
He gave me some bullshit
about artistic differences.

25:51.862 --> 25:53.269
What the hell happened?

25:53.334 --> 25:55.985
Nothing.
How can he do that?

25:56.054 --> 25:57.614
They're doing it right now.

25:57.686 --> 26:01.003
Can't we do something?
Maybe I should talk to Rubin.

26:01.078 --> 26:03.315
You better forget it.
They've already hired another guy.

26:03.382 --> 26:05.803
- How do you know?
- He's my client.

26:10.358 --> 26:12.692
Now bring them up.

26:12.758 --> 26:16.271
You're loving every minute of it,
sweetheart. It feels so good.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.993
You're getting ready to take
a nice chunk out of the neck.

26:19.062 --> 26:21.550
Hands down. Good.

26:21.622 --> 26:23.477
All right, cut!

26:23.542 --> 26:25.069
Kill the water and steam.

26:25.142 --> 26:26.996
I thought you were gonna
give me another chance.

26:27.062 --> 26:30.836
Look, I got a picture to make here.
I got 25 days to make it.

26:30.902 --> 26:34.349
I got no time to fuck around
with a claustrophobic vampire...

26:34.422 --> 26:36.593
who freezes every time
he lies down in the coffin.

26:36.662 --> 26:39.629
- I'm not claustrophobic.
- Then what happened? Stage fright?

26:39.702 --> 26:41.556
I don't know.
It never happened before.

26:41.622 --> 26:45.396
It's never gonna happen again.
Good-bye. I gotta get back to work.

26:45.462 --> 26:48.429
- You promised me another chance.
- I lied.

26:48.502 --> 26:50.193
- Don't you yell at me!
- Big fucking deal.

26:50.262 --> 26:51.952
- Get outta here! Beat it!
- Listen...

26:52.022 --> 26:56.113
Joe, get him outta here! You don't come
in here yelling at me on my set!

26:56.182 --> 26:58.189
- You don't have the right to lie to me.
- There's the door.

26:59.062 --> 27:00.753
Go on! Get out!

27:00.822 --> 27:04.117
Get out the door, you fruitcake.
What's wrong with you?

27:04.182 --> 27:05.589
- He's the boss.
- It's not fair.

27:05.654 --> 27:09.484
What's everybody standing around for?
Let's get back to work. Come on.

27:33.622 --> 27:35.509
Just like clockwork.

28:06.262 --> 28:07.636
There she goes.

30:40.501 --> 30:43.949
Excuse me.
Could you move, please? Please!

30:44.022 --> 30:45.680
I gotta go.
Thank you.

31:27.541 --> 31:29.549
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Thank you.

31:39.382 --> 31:41.072
I have to see you.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.792
What time did you call?

31:45.142 --> 31:46.996
I'm never home till after 7:00.

31:48.982 --> 31:50.989
Yes, he hit me again.

31:56.182 --> 31:58.189
I've got to talk to someone.

31:59.542 --> 32:00.916
Today.

32:02.422 --> 32:03.948
The Beach Terrace Motel?

32:04.981 --> 32:07.948
I'II wear something special.

32:08.021 --> 32:09.396
You'll see.

32:14.102 --> 32:16.044
Yeah. Okay.

32:16.118 --> 32:17.492
Bye.

35:37.782 --> 35:40.116
- Security, please.
- This is security.

35:40.181 --> 35:42.996
Please come over to Bellini's.
I think we have a problem.

36:30.582 --> 36:32.108
Excuse me.

36:34.389 --> 36:37.236
- May I help you?
- No, thank you.

39:12.181 --> 39:13.555
Did you see that guy?

39:38.709 --> 39:40.716
- It's the cream Mercedes.
- Wait here, please.

40:22.710 --> 40:25.524
- Thank you. Here you are.
- Thank you, ma'am.

40:27.029 --> 40:29.363
- Can I have my car, please?
- Yes, sir.

40:29.430 --> 40:31.950
Thank you.
Right away. As soon as possible.

40:33.653 --> 40:35.922
Straight toward the beach,
down the stairs.

40:35.989 --> 40:37.364
Thank you.

43:47.349 --> 43:48.723
Hello?

43:53.333 --> 43:54.707
Yes.

43:56.469 --> 43:57.996
You've got to come.

44:00.085 --> 44:02.605
I need to talk to you.

44:02.677 --> 44:04.106
I've got to talk to someone.

44:08.469 --> 44:09.995
I need you.

45:09.109 --> 45:10.483
Excuse me.

45:11.765 --> 45:13.805
Someone's following you.

45:20.116 --> 45:21.491
I know.

45:23.189 --> 45:24.716
No, it's not me.

49:02.069 --> 49:03.596
Are you all right?

49:03.669 --> 49:05.043
He got away.

49:05.909 --> 49:08.080
You got the purse.

49:08.148 --> 49:11.444
You better check it.
He took something.

49:13.269 --> 49:14.643
What's the matter?

49:16.788 --> 49:18.643
I'm just out of breath.

49:20.341 --> 49:23.756
Can you take me out of here?

49:23.829 --> 49:25.203
Sure.

49:26.228 --> 49:27.789
- Here.
- Thank you.

49:58.389 --> 50:00.876
All right. Thank you.

50:00.948 --> 50:04.396
I feel much better now.
I'm fine.

50:04.469 --> 50:08.244
I saw you back there
and at the hotel.

50:08.309 --> 50:11.887
- You've been following me.
- Yeah.

50:14.228 --> 50:17.294
Why?
Did my husband hire you?

50:23.509 --> 50:24.883
I'm...

50:27.701 --> 50:29.075
What?

51:36.469 --> 51:37.843
Yes.

52:05.844 --> 52:08.714
I can't.
I can't do this.

52:08.788 --> 52:10.163
Not here.

52:28.788 --> 52:31.505
Hello, Gloria.
How are you?

52:31.572 --> 52:34.322
Maybe you remember me.
This is Jake.

52:34.388 --> 52:37.836
I'm the guy that almost fucked you
at the beach today.

52:38.869 --> 52:40.559
No, that's terrible.

52:44.244 --> 52:45.618
Hi, Gloria.

54:16.852 --> 54:18.859
- Hello?
- How are you doing?

54:18.932 --> 54:21.266
Sam, how's everything?

54:21.332 --> 54:23.820
Great.
Everything okay over there?

54:23.892 --> 54:26.129
Yeah. No problems.

54:26.197 --> 54:29.874
How's our favorite neighbor?
Still with the midnight shows?

54:33.973 --> 54:37.234
- Uh-huh?
- You sound a little preoccupied.

54:42.932 --> 54:44.787
I just called
to see how things were going.

54:44.852 --> 54:47.340
By the way,
any messages for me?

54:51.253 --> 54:56.555
- Hello? Are you there?
- Yeah.

54:56.628 --> 55:00.621
I'm here. I'm sorry.
There are no messages.

55:01.972 --> 55:04.492
Gotta run.
I'll be in touch.

55:16.852 --> 55:18.227
My God.

57:09.300 --> 57:11.187
If you'd like to make a call,
please...

57:21.076 --> 57:23.050
Hurry.

57:44.692 --> 57:47.278
- Hello.
- Look out! He's right behind you!

57:47.348 --> 57:49.584
- What?
- My God!

58:27.892 --> 58:30.194
Stop! You guys, stop!

58:43.252 --> 58:46.219
What do you want?
Are you crazy?

58:46.292 --> 58:48.463
- There's a woman being killed.
- What?

58:48.532 --> 58:50.222
Come on!

59:23.508 --> 59:27.185
L.A. City Emergency. This is 911.
What are you reporting?

59:28.212 --> 59:32.467
This is L.A. City Emergency.
Hello?

59:37.236 --> 59:39.309
I'm sorry, I can’t hear you.
Please...

59:42.388 --> 59:45.585
Please tell me the nature
of your emergency.

59:52.948 --> 59:54.323
Don't.

59:58.676 --> 01:00:00.618
No. Please, don't.

01:01:44.148 --> 01:01:46.734
Get him off me!
He's killing her!

01:02:01.364 --> 01:02:02.738
Stop!

01:02:14.132 --> 01:02:15.658
God!

01:02:35.603 --> 01:02:38.156
I'm Detective McLean.

01:02:38.227 --> 01:02:40.333
I'm in charge
of this investigation.

01:02:42.771 --> 01:02:44.626
I see you're an actor.

01:02:49.843 --> 01:02:51.753
Yeah.

01:02:51.828 --> 01:02:53.682
Ever been in anything?

01:02:55.572 --> 01:02:58.386
'Emerald Point" and a "Hart To Hart"
that was pretty good.

01:02:59.412 --> 01:03:01.102
Very interesting.

01:03:02.131 --> 01:03:03.986
You make a living?

01:03:06.548 --> 01:03:07.922
Yeah.

01:03:09.043 --> 01:03:11.182
Good-looking boy.

01:03:11.252 --> 01:03:12.626
Talented.

01:03:13.747 --> 01:03:15.951
I got a real problem with you.

01:03:17.748 --> 01:03:19.176
What do you mean?

01:03:19.251 --> 01:03:22.600
I mean, you're my only witness
to this murder...

01:03:22.676 --> 01:03:24.531
and you're a peeper.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:28.975
In my book, that's a pervert
and a sex offender.

01:03:29.044 --> 01:03:31.761
- What do you mean "a sex offender"?
- Save it.

01:03:31.828 --> 01:03:34.283
I ask the questions.

01:03:34.515 --> 01:03:37.483
What about this Indian? When he snatched
her pocketbook, you got it back.

01:03:37.556 --> 01:03:40.043
- Is that right?
- That's right.

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:42.004
Was anything missing?

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:43.923
I saw him take a credit card.

01:03:45.204 --> 01:03:48.303
Not a credit card, a card key.

01:03:48.372 --> 01:03:50.314
He used it to get into her house.

01:03:57.076 --> 01:03:58.734
Did Gloria know it was missing?

01:03:58.804 --> 01:04:01.106
She didn't say anything to me.

01:04:03.028 --> 01:04:04.882
You talked to her?

01:04:07.284 --> 01:04:09.673
Come on,
you must have said something.

01:04:17.011 --> 01:04:19.794
- It was just small talk, you know?
- No, I don't know.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:21.715
Did you come on to her?

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.722
Were you trying to do a number
on her head?

01:04:23.796 --> 01:04:25.705
Trying to freak her out
with all you know about her?

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:29.260
- You're wrong.
- Why were you following Gloria Revelle?

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:34.796
Because I got concerned
when I saw that guy following her.

01:04:34.868 --> 01:04:37.737
But you kept on her tail
after this other guy disappeared.

01:04:37.812 --> 01:04:39.186
I know, because...

01:04:40.372 --> 01:04:43.983
- I guess I wanted to...
- You wanted to what?

01:04:54.707 --> 01:04:56.082
Nothing.

01:05:02.964 --> 01:05:04.338
What's this?

01:05:08.403 --> 01:05:10.640
Some underpants.

01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:12.082
Yours?

01:05:14.163 --> 01:05:15.625
Where did you get them?

01:05:21.523 --> 01:05:24.076
She dropped them in the trash.

01:05:24.148 --> 01:05:26.155
- Who?
- Gloria.

01:05:26.227 --> 01:05:28.137
And you just picked them up?

01:05:29.811 --> 01:05:31.699
- Yeah.
- Why?

01:05:38.451 --> 01:05:41.168
- I don't know.
- Tell the truth.

01:05:41.235 --> 01:05:43.788
You fucked her and kept them
for a souvenir.

01:05:43.859 --> 01:05:46.674
You didn't fuck her or you didn't
keep them as a souvenir?

01:05:46.739 --> 01:05:50.088
- No to both of them.
- Are you just a harmless panty sniffer?

01:05:50.164 --> 01:05:52.400
- You got a dirty mind.
- That's a laugh.

01:05:52.468 --> 01:05:56.264
You peep on her, follow her, fuck her
and keep her panties as a memento.

01:05:56.339 --> 01:05:59.209
Then you sit on the 50-yard line
and watch her being slaughtered!

01:05:59.283 --> 01:06:01.672
That's not what happened!
I tried to save her!

01:06:06.355 --> 01:06:10.217
Mm-hmm. Some save, Scully.

01:06:12.692 --> 01:06:15.659
Remind me to never put my life
in your hands.

01:06:20.339 --> 01:06:22.194
Tell me about Alexander Revelle.

01:06:26.196 --> 01:06:30.255
- What?
- Alexander Revelle, Gloria's husband.

01:06:30.324 --> 01:06:31.785
You knew him?

01:06:34.547 --> 01:06:35.922
I never met him.

01:06:38.068 --> 01:06:40.457
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:06:41.652 --> 01:06:44.335
Was he around
when Gloria got nailed?

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.689
Do you think he had something
to do with it?

01:06:49.428 --> 01:06:53.137
Gloria Revelle was a very rich lady.

01:06:55.188 --> 01:06:59.378
When rich wives get dead,
I usually go after the husband.

01:07:01.716 --> 01:07:04.618
The only problem is
you saw a thief.

01:07:04.692 --> 01:07:07.059
An Indian killed Gloria Revelle.

01:07:13.203 --> 01:07:15.789
I won't hold you, Scully.

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.675
We have witnesses
to back up your story.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:23.024
But I want you
to think real hard about this.

01:07:24.051 --> 01:07:25.458
As far as I'm concerned...

01:07:25.523 --> 01:07:28.785
you're the real reason Gloria Revelle
got murdered.

01:07:31.123 --> 01:07:34.669
If you hadn't been so busy getting off
by peeping on her...

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.602
if you had called the police
about your blood brother, the Indian...

01:07:38.675 --> 01:07:41.425
Gloria Revelle would still be alive.

01:07:58.996 --> 01:08:00.370
Oh, yeah.

01:08:13.971 --> 01:08:17.746
Linda, we believe that you have
your own production company now.

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:21.006
Yes, Linda Shaw Enterprises.

01:08:21.076 --> 01:08:23.629
What are some of those enterprises?

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.660
We have a film 'Deep Ghost'
and 'The Mating Game. '

01:08:29.363 --> 01:08:33.225
- 'One Night at a Time. '
- Yes.

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:38.537
I believe you have a film opening
this Friday at the Pussy Flick Theater?

01:08:38.612 --> 01:08:42.953
- What is the title of that?
- That’s 'Bold Obsession. '

01:08:43.027 --> 01:08:46.410
Tell us, Linda,
what is your 'bold obsession'?

01:08:46.483 --> 01:08:51.339
Sid, that script was written especially
for me, because I am an expositionist.

01:08:51.411 --> 01:08:54.127
You are an 'expositions'?
Do you mean an exhibitionist?

01:08:54.194 --> 01:08:56.562
- Yes, exhibitionist.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:08:56.627 --> 01:09:00.075
I just get so excited when I know
they’re all out there watching me.

01:09:00.148 --> 01:09:02.569
Of course
they're out there watching you.

01:09:02.643 --> 01:09:04.782
- It gets me so hot.
- It does?

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:06.738
What happens when you get hot?

01:09:06.804 --> 01:09:09.138
- It makes me want to come.
- You want to come.

01:09:09.203 --> 01:09:11.341
While you're coming,
let’s watch this clip.

01:09:12.627 --> 01:09:14.995
Five minutes, Miss Body.

01:09:15.059 --> 01:09:16.433
I'm ready.

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.107
We've got five minutes.

01:09:22.772 --> 01:09:26.252
Eddie, where the hell are you?
We need you on the set.

01:09:26.323 --> 01:09:29.356

01:09:45.587 --> 01:09:46.961
in the gutter. '

01:09:50.323 --> 01:09:54.447
Says Eros Magazine: 'The 'Gone
With The Wind' Of Adult Films. '

01:09:54.516 --> 01:09:57.811

Excuse me.
Do you have 'Holly Does Hollywood"?

Yeah, we do. It's in our adult section.
Follow me.

01:10:50.644 --> 01:10:53.229
- On VHS?
- Yeah, VHS. Whatever you want.

01:10:53.299 --> 01:10:56.147
Half-inch, three-quarter, Beta.

01:10:58.643 --> 01:11:01.578
- Is this what you're talking about?
- That's it.

01:11:58.547 --> 01:12:01.515
- Hello. Adult Blue Films.
- I was wondering if you could help me.

01:12:01.588 --> 01:12:03.759
Are you the company that distributes
"Holly Does Hollywood"?

01:12:03.827 --> 01:12:06.510
- Yes.
- I'm not some fucking stunt cock.

01:12:06.579 --> 01:12:09.035
- I'm an actor.
- You’ll have to wait.

01:12:09.107 --> 01:12:12.403
I have been waiting,
for more than an hour.

01:12:12.467 --> 01:12:15.369
Do you know how many pictures
I've made with Holly?

01:12:15.443 --> 01:12:17.418
Baby, I am sure
you have made a lot.

01:12:17.491 --> 01:12:19.346
I don't have to take this shit.

01:12:19.411 --> 01:12:21.200
I got a reputation
in this business.

01:12:21.267 --> 01:12:23.307
If you want to audition,
sit down!

01:12:23.379 --> 01:12:26.695
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

01:12:26.771 --> 01:12:29.105
- Can I help you?
- How late are the auditions going today?

01:12:29.172 --> 01:12:31.506
- Probably past 6:00.
- Thank you.

01:12:31.571 --> 01:12:33.262
You're welcome. Bye.

01:12:36.531 --> 01:12:38.670
Mr. Corso, Jake Scully.

01:12:40.179 --> 01:12:41.586
Pleasure to meet you.

01:12:42.612 --> 01:12:43.986
Stand over there.

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:49.232
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:12:49.299 --> 01:12:50.673
Go ahead.

01:12:53.651 --> 01:12:56.618
I like to watch.

01:12:58.515 --> 01:13:00.370
Makes you hot, doesn't it?

01:13:01.971 --> 01:13:03.345
Yeah.

01:13:04.403 --> 01:13:06.542
Makes me hot too.
Real hot.

01:13:06.612 --> 01:13:09.579
Come over here.
I'll show you how hot.

01:13:11.412 --> 01:13:13.746
All right.
Take off your clothes.

01:13:13.811 --> 01:13:15.666
I want to take some pictures.

01:13:21.331 --> 01:13:24.909
- What is it that we're watching?
- I don't know.

01:13:24.979 --> 01:13:27.914
Are you some kind of method actor?

01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:39.026
Give it to me one time now

01:13:53.556 --> 01:13:56.141
Relax
Don’t do it

01:13:56.211 --> 01:13:57.837
When you wanna go for it

01:14:00.211 --> 01:14:01.902
When you wanna come

01:14:04.211 --> 01:14:06.513
When you wanna suck to it

01:14:48.051 --> 01:14:51.018
But shoot it
in the right direction

01:14:52.051 --> 01:14:54.866
Make making it your intention

01:14:56.051 --> 01:14:57.993
Live those dreams

01:14:58.067 --> 01:14:59.823
Scheme those schemes

01:14:59.891 --> 01:15:01.899
- Gotta hit me
- Hit me

01:15:01.971 --> 01:15:05.037
Hit me with those laser beams

01:15:55.923 --> 01:15:57.778
I like to watch.

01:16:01.747 --> 01:16:04.300
Makes you hot, doesn't it?

01:16:04.371 --> 01:16:05.745
Yeah.

01:16:07.251 --> 01:16:08.777
Makes me hot too.

01:16:10.387 --> 01:16:13.321
Come over here,
and I'II show you how hot.

01:18:27.539 --> 01:18:29.906
- Where's the come shot?
- Huh? Come?

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:32.906
The come shot. I thought we were doing
'Body Talk" here, not 'Last Tango."

01:18:39.635 --> 01:18:42.635
You were great out there. Really.
Come on, I'II buy you a drink.

01:18:44.211 --> 01:18:46.600
A drink?
I don't even know you.

01:18:46.675 --> 01:18:49.577
I'm talking business.

01:18:49.651 --> 01:18:51.025
Come on.

01:18:52.051 --> 01:18:54.385
You know the mirror out there?

01:18:54.451 --> 01:18:56.305
That was my idea.

01:18:57.651 --> 01:19:00.498
So, you're a genius.

01:19:00.562 --> 01:19:05.167
No, but I can make a better film
than Corso, with my eyes closed.

01:19:05.235 --> 01:19:08.137
Films cost money, you know.

01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:09.585
I got money.

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:14.536
Then what are you doing in hard-core?

01:19:14.611 --> 01:19:16.105
I wanted to meet you.

01:19:17.523 --> 01:19:19.345
Why?

01:19:19.411 --> 01:19:23.185
Because I think you're sensational.
I think you're the best in the business.

01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:25.771
I'll pay you top dollar.
I'll give you points.

01:19:25.843 --> 01:19:27.730
Whatever it takes.

01:19:29.202 --> 01:19:32.617
- Really?
- I want you in my picture.

01:19:32.690 --> 01:19:36.585
- You're really serious?
- Yeah, of course I am.

01:19:36.659 --> 01:19:38.033
Okay, good.

01:19:39.731 --> 01:19:42.152
There are some things I like
to get straight up front...

01:19:42.227 --> 01:19:44.496
so there are no misunderstandings
later on.

01:19:44.562 --> 01:19:47.464
- I don't blame you.
- I do not do animal acts.

01:19:47.539 --> 01:19:51.281
I do not do S and M or any variations
of that particular bent.

01:19:51.347 --> 01:19:53.234
No water sports either.

01:19:53.299 --> 01:19:55.633
I will not shave my pussy,
no fist fucking...

01:19:55.699 --> 01:19:58.120
and absolutely no coming in my face.

01:19:58.195 --> 01:20:03.148
I get $2,000 a day,
and I do not work without a contract.

01:20:08.466 --> 01:20:10.354
Fine.
I mean, that's no problem.

01:20:12.818 --> 01:20:16.331
- I think we got a deal.
- Cheers.

01:20:18.131 --> 01:20:19.985
You ever do any specialty work?

01:20:21.843 --> 01:20:24.429
What kind of specialty work
are you looking for?

01:20:26.002 --> 01:20:28.523
A woman alone,
getting herself off.

01:20:30.419 --> 01:20:31.880
It's got to be really hot.

01:20:35.283 --> 01:20:36.657
Is that all?

01:20:38.035 --> 01:20:41.679
I have a routine that is a sure ten
on the peter-meter.

01:20:42.707 --> 01:20:44.846
- I know. I've seen it.
- Yeah?

01:20:44.915 --> 01:20:46.769
A few times.

01:20:46.835 --> 01:20:50.217
Yeah, I'm known far and wide...

01:20:50.291 --> 01:20:52.560
for that little bit of business.

01:20:57.747 --> 01:21:00.081
I want you to know
I saw 'Holly Does Hollywood"...

01:21:00.147 --> 01:21:04.206
and I think your acting
is top drawer.

01:21:07.634 --> 01:21:09.457
- My acting?
- Yep.

01:21:09.523 --> 01:21:13.581
You're fantastic.
Really. Sensational.

01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:16.301
I'II tell you something else.

01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:18.737
- You have got a terrific...
- Body.

01:21:20.243 --> 01:21:21.617
Smile.

01:21:25.331 --> 01:21:26.705
Smile"?

01:21:35.122 --> 01:21:37.424
Look at you.

01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:40.174
- Kimberly, how are you?
- I'm fine, just lovely.

01:21:40.243 --> 01:21:44.465
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your friend?

01:21:45.938 --> 01:21:48.273
- Kimberly Hess. Hello.
- Nice to know you.

01:21:49.139 --> 01:21:51.244
So, Jake, you working?

01:21:51.315 --> 01:21:53.868
Yeah, here and there.
We have to run.

01:21:53.939 --> 01:21:55.564
- It's great to see you though.
- Right.

01:21:55.634 --> 01:21:57.544
Jake and I worked together
in the past.

01:21:57.619 --> 01:21:58.993
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:21:59.059 --> 01:22:02.321
I thought I knew everybody
in this business.

01:22:03.826 --> 01:22:05.233
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:05.299 --> 01:22:07.819
I don't see how someone
could know everyone.

01:22:07.891 --> 01:22:09.713
It's a funny business.

01:22:11.795 --> 01:22:13.705
Anyway, I wanted to ask you...

01:22:13.778 --> 01:22:17.226
have you heard of any roles
that might be right for...

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:20.266
- No, I'm sorry.
- I have. I have a tip for you.

01:22:20.338 --> 01:22:23.055
- Really?
- Yes, Simon La Farge is casting.

01:22:23.122 --> 01:22:25.064
- You know him, right?
- No.

01:22:25.138 --> 01:22:27.953
No? Are you from outer space?

01:22:28.018 --> 01:22:31.793
Just tell him that you ran into me.
Here's his number.

01:22:31.858 --> 01:22:35.470
You might want to firm up a bit
before you go and see him.

01:22:35.539 --> 01:22:38.987
One more thing.
Do you mind working with ladies?

01:22:40.979 --> 01:22:43.946
- Acting is acting, right?
- That's right.

01:22:44.019 --> 01:22:46.507
I think that's really admirable.

01:22:46.578 --> 01:22:48.433
Me, myself, I can't get into it.

01:22:48.498 --> 01:22:51.794
But, anyway, good luck
and say hello to Simon for me.

01:22:51.859 --> 01:22:54.477
- Good seeing you.
- Sure. Thanks.

01:22:54.546 --> 01:22:55.920
By the way...

01:22:57.651 --> 01:22:59.658
what's the film about?

01:22:59.731 --> 01:23:01.389
That's good.

01:23:01.459 --> 01:23:03.630
We need more comedians
in our business.

01:23:03.698 --> 01:23:05.127
Good luck.

01:23:09.939 --> 01:23:11.313
Very nice.

01:23:12.659 --> 01:23:14.993
What can I get you?
Jack Daniels?

01:23:16.178 --> 01:23:18.993
How about Jake Scully...

01:23:19.058 --> 01:23:20.433
straight up?

01:23:21.938 --> 01:23:23.313
Very funny.

01:23:33.939 --> 01:23:35.313
Hello.

01:23:42.579 --> 01:23:44.106
Listen, Holly...

01:23:44.178 --> 01:23:46.033
I don't want to talk
any more business.

01:23:46.098 --> 01:23:47.473
Yeah, well...

01:23:47.539 --> 01:23:48.913
Listen.

01:23:48.978 --> 01:23:50.353
Lie down.

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:58.986
We had one of these
in "Star Whores."

01:24:00.019 --> 01:24:02.507
There's something I gotta tell you.

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:04.105
You're married.

01:24:04.178 --> 01:24:06.033
- What then?
- I'm not a producer.

01:24:06.098 --> 01:24:07.953
You're not a producer.

01:24:09.619 --> 01:24:12.586
l... Hold up. I'm not...

01:24:14.099 --> 01:24:15.473
Just a second.

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:20.114
I'm not interested
in making a film with you.

01:24:22.258 --> 01:24:25.225
- What are you interested in then?
- You.

01:24:26.418 --> 01:24:30.193
I saw you in the house
those other nights.

01:24:30.258 --> 01:24:31.633
What house?

01:24:32.818 --> 01:24:35.633
You know,
that show that you put on...

01:24:35.698 --> 01:24:38.349
with the masturbation routine
and all the diamonds and everything.

01:24:38.419 --> 01:24:40.274
I was watching you from here.

01:24:43.538 --> 01:24:47.564
You were the girl in the window.
That wasn't Gloria. That was you.

01:24:48.819 --> 01:24:50.226
What's it to you?

01:24:50.291 --> 01:24:54.033
Just tell me if I'm right.
That was you in the Revelle house.

01:24:54.098 --> 01:24:55.473
Right?

01:24:57.138 --> 01:25:00.270
I'm not saying that it was me,
and I'm not saying that it wasn't me.

01:25:00.339 --> 01:25:03.437
I'm saying,
why are you interested in knowing?

01:25:09.458 --> 01:25:14.826
I think that one of my crazy friends
has played a practical joke on me.

01:25:14.899 --> 01:25:17.070
You know how it is
with the idle rich.

01:25:20.499 --> 01:25:25.387
Tell me, were you the girl
in the house?

01:25:25.459 --> 01:25:26.986
- Yeah, that was me.
- I knew it.

01:25:27.058 --> 01:25:29.873
How did this thing get set up?

01:25:29.938 --> 01:25:33.234
Tell me just to satisfy my curiosity.

01:25:33.298 --> 01:25:37.226
One of my crazy friends set this up,
but I don't know who.

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:38.672
Who hired you?

01:25:38.739 --> 01:25:41.870
- You were the one I was playing to?
- Yeah.

01:25:41.938 --> 01:25:45.233
- And there's no part for me.
- I'm sorry.

01:25:45.298 --> 01:25:47.470
- This whole thing was a joke.
- Yeah.

01:25:47.539 --> 01:25:49.394
It was a practical joke on me.

01:25:49.459 --> 01:25:52.426
Did Sam Bouchard
set this whole thing up?

01:25:52.498 --> 01:25:54.353
Did he hire you
to do your routine?

01:25:54.418 --> 01:25:56.589
He didn't tell me his name.

01:25:56.658 --> 01:25:59.954
Whoever you talked to,
what did he say?

01:26:01.458 --> 01:26:05.070
This guy called me up and said
he had seen my self-help routine...

01:26:05.138 --> 01:26:06.665
in 'Holly Does Hollywood"...

01:26:06.739 --> 01:26:09.870
and he wanted to hire me
to do it in private.

01:26:09.938 --> 01:26:14.193
He said that he had this friend
who got off on peeping.

01:26:14.259 --> 01:26:18.033
- He didn't tell you who he was?
- No. He didn't tell me his name.

01:26:18.099 --> 01:26:21.230
He just sent a messenger over
with money...

01:26:21.298 --> 01:26:24.113
and with a card key...

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:26.185
and a wig.

01:26:26.258 --> 01:26:27.632
Please don't leave.

01:26:27.699 --> 01:26:30.994
Just stay here for a second.

01:26:31.058 --> 01:26:32.432
Can you hold on?

01:26:35.218 --> 01:26:36.745
- Hello.
- Lf's Sam.

01:26:36.818 --> 01:26:39.785
- How are you doing? Can you hold on?
- Sure.

01:26:39.858 --> 01:26:41.233
Hold on.

01:26:42.578 --> 01:26:44.269
Please, listen to this guy's voice.

01:26:44.338 --> 01:26:47.950
Tell me if he's the one
that hired you. Please.

01:26:48.019 --> 01:26:50.986
Hello. I'm sorry. You got me
in the shower. How are you doing?

01:26:51.058 --> 01:26:55.149
- I'm afraid I got some bad news, pal.
- What's that?

01:26:55.218 --> 01:26:57.390
Seattle Rep and I
had some artistic differences.

01:26:57.459 --> 01:26:59.313
I'm gonna be heading back to L.A.

01:26:59.379 --> 01:27:02.826
So I guess you'll have to find
another place to crash.

01:27:02.898 --> 01:27:04.273
That's him.

01:27:04.339 --> 01:27:06.673
- You got some company there?
- Actually, I do.

01:27:06.738 --> 01:27:10.186
It's kind of a bad time to talk.
You want to call back in 15 minutes?

01:27:10.258 --> 01:27:13.553
- Yeah...
- That was the guy who hired you?

01:27:13.618 --> 01:27:15.309
- Yes, that was him.
- Are you sure?

01:27:15.378 --> 01:27:17.385
- Yes, I'm sure that was him.
- Listen.

01:27:17.458 --> 01:27:20.906
- God, you're really sick.
- Listen to me very carefully.

01:27:20.978 --> 01:27:24.426
I am not a film producer,
and I am not a rich kid.

01:27:24.499 --> 01:27:26.025
No, you're a jerk.

01:27:26.098 --> 01:27:28.433
Holly, please listen to me
for a second.

01:27:29.938 --> 01:27:34.673
You were hired to do two nights' work,
to do your routine and leave.

01:27:34.738 --> 01:27:36.265
- Is that true?
- Yes.

01:27:36.338 --> 01:27:38.672
- Do you know why?
- You just told me why.

01:27:38.739 --> 01:27:41.553
You just told me some guy
was playing a joke on you.

01:27:41.619 --> 01:27:43.309
He wasn't playing a joke on you?

01:27:43.378 --> 01:27:46.193
- Do you want to tell me what it was?
- Yes.

01:27:46.258 --> 01:27:48.593
The truth.

01:27:48.658 --> 01:27:50.992
The truth is a woman was murdered.

01:27:52.818 --> 01:27:56.430
It's not funny. A woman was murdered.
You and I were set up by a murderer.

01:27:56.498 --> 01:27:58.505
He wanted to be sure
I witnessed the murder.

01:27:58.578 --> 01:28:00.433
That's why he hired you
to do your routine.

01:28:00.498 --> 01:28:02.832
Meanwhile, he arranged it
so that I would be watching.

01:28:02.899 --> 01:28:05.713
He wanted me to think that the girl
who lived there, Gloria Revelle...

01:28:05.779 --> 01:28:07.153
was the one getting off.

01:28:07.218 --> 01:28:10.349
Meanwhile, he thought I would watch
and keep watching.

01:28:10.418 --> 01:28:13.069
Holly, are you listening to me?

01:28:13.138 --> 01:28:15.473
Yes.
I don't understand what you've said.

01:28:15.538 --> 01:28:17.709
Listen, he's a murderer!

01:28:17.778 --> 01:28:20.266
The man who hired you is a murderer!
Come here.

01:28:21.618 --> 01:28:23.112
Please, come here.

01:28:23.186 --> 01:28:25.008
Do you remember
where you did your routine?

01:28:25.075 --> 01:28:27.496
- Yes.
- You see that house down there?

01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:29.545
- That window is where you were, right?
- Yes.

01:28:37.555 --> 01:28:39.943
- Now do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

01:28:40.018 --> 01:28:43.466
I understand you're sick and you're
a liar and you need professional help.

01:28:43.538 --> 01:28:45.545
- I do not like being yelled at!
- I'm sorry.

01:28:45.618 --> 01:28:47.625
I should have known when you told me
I had a terrific smile.

01:28:47.698 --> 01:28:50.033
No real producer would tell me that
in a million years.

01:28:50.098 --> 01:28:51.886
Get out of my way.

01:28:51.955 --> 01:28:53.809
- What?
- Just come with me to the police.

01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:57.071
To the police? Are you crazy?
Listen to me, you weirdo...

01:28:57.138 --> 01:28:59.626
- A woman was murdered!
- I'm leaving! Don't follow me home!

01:28:59.698 --> 01:29:01.454
I have friends
who will break your legs!

01:29:02.578 --> 01:29:04.879
Let go of me! God!

01:29:04.947 --> 01:29:07.314
You weirdo!
There are so many weird people.

01:29:19.538 --> 01:29:22.059
Can I have the Hollywood
Police Department, please?

01:29:22.130 --> 01:29:23.985
Fucking freaky actors.

01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:25.708
That's what there is here.

01:29:25.778 --> 01:29:28.429
Masochistic directors.

01:29:28.498 --> 01:29:31.465
I should have known when he didn't
even know what a come shot was.

01:29:32.978 --> 01:29:34.986
Yeah, Detective McLean, please.

01:29:41.779 --> 01:29:43.950
Excuse me.
Stop, please.

01:29:45.138 --> 01:29:47.309
Thank you very much, lady!

01:29:51.027 --> 01:29:52.401
I was set up.

01:29:54.098 --> 01:29:57.415
Yeah, Hollywood's busiest
sex offender.

01:29:57.491 --> 01:29:59.345
Cut it out.
Just listen to me for a minute.

01:29:59.411 --> 01:30:01.385
I got something important
to tell you.

01:30:02.418 --> 01:30:04.174
I know who killed Gloria Revelle.

01:30:04.242 --> 01:30:05.835
Is this a confession?

01:30:07.058 --> 01:30:08.432
Listen.

01:30:09.458 --> 01:30:11.313
Just pay attention.

01:30:11.378 --> 01:30:13.800
A few days ago I was looking
for an apartment.

01:30:13.874 --> 01:30:17.070
Do you know any sublets
that would be available right away?

01:30:17.138 --> 01:30:18.829
I'll check around.

01:30:18.898 --> 01:30:22.510
I noticed this guy,
Sam Bouchard.

01:30:22.578 --> 01:30:25.066
He was looking for somebody
who needed a place to stay.

01:30:25.138 --> 01:30:28.433
I thought it was a coincidence
that we kept running info each other.

01:30:29.618 --> 01:30:31.757
Hi. Again.

01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:35.623
Anyway, now I realize
he was throwing out a net.

01:30:35.698 --> 01:30:38.480
He was sizing me up
for a part that he was casting.

01:30:38.546 --> 01:30:40.586
I want you to cry out for help!

01:30:42.642 --> 01:30:44.016
I can't.

01:30:44.082 --> 01:30:48.904
I fit the bill perfectly:
lovesick sucker, out on his ass.

01:30:48.978 --> 01:30:51.084
Shit.
What a fool I am.

01:30:51.155 --> 01:30:52.977
And you know what the part was?

01:30:53.042 --> 01:30:54.536
I'm listening.

01:30:54.610 --> 01:30:56.944
The part of the witness.

01:30:57.010 --> 01:31:00.971
He told me there was this neighbor that
did this number on herself every night.

01:31:01.042 --> 01:31:04.010
- See her?
- He knew that I would look.

01:31:04.082 --> 01:31:06.090
- Nice, huh?
- Yeah.

01:31:06.162 --> 01:31:09.260
He knew I would keep looking.
And it wasn’t Gloria.

01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:11.981
It was Holly doing her routine.
That’s why I never saw her face.

01:31:13.618 --> 01:31:16.652
You sound like a conspiracy nut:
plots all around you.

01:31:16.722 --> 01:31:18.827
Please, just listen to me
for a second.

01:31:20.338 --> 01:31:23.502
Sam Bouchard is Alexander Revelle.

01:31:24.562 --> 01:31:26.700
He hired the Indian
to follow Gloria...

01:31:26.770 --> 01:31:29.640
and snatch her purse
and steal the card key to her house...

01:31:29.714 --> 01:31:32.299
and then sneak inside.

01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:34.737
Then when she got home...

01:31:34.802 --> 01:31:38.632
the Indian opened the blinds
so I could see him kill her.

01:31:38.706 --> 01:31:43.408
Alexander Revelle set me up
in this house to witness the murder.

01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:46.670
He hired a porno actress
to be the bait.

01:31:49.810 --> 01:31:52.494
Can I have a ride, please?

01:31:52.562 --> 01:31:54.417
Thanks a lot, you jerks!

01:32:04.338 --> 01:32:05.745
Oh, my God.

01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:09.388
I've been trying to build a case
against the husband all along...

01:32:09.458 --> 01:32:11.313
but the reason
it hasn't panned out...

01:32:11.378 --> 01:32:15.120
is because of your testimony
that Gloria was killed by an Indian.

01:32:15.186 --> 01:32:18.000
That's just it! Don't you see?
That's what he wanted!

01:32:18.066 --> 01:32:19.789
It looks like a burglary,
but it's a murder...

01:32:19.858 --> 01:32:22.192
with me set up
to be the witness!

01:32:22.258 --> 01:32:25.007
I'm Alexander Revelle's alibi.

01:32:28.114 --> 01:32:30.984
Listen. Stop, all right?

01:32:31.058 --> 01:32:35.727
Just stop! Right there!

01:32:36.754 --> 01:32:39.143
There has been an accident
up there.

01:32:39.218 --> 01:32:42.513
- Those people are probably very hurt.
- Slow down, lady.

01:32:42.578 --> 01:32:44.716
- Nobody's bothered to stop.
- Get in the car.

01:32:44.786 --> 01:32:46.641
It sounds crazy to me.

01:32:47.698 --> 01:32:50.545
I know, but it's the truth.

01:32:53.458 --> 01:32:55.880
Maybe you better come down here.

01:33:12.594 --> 01:33:15.855
Pull it up. That's it.
Pull your car right up there.

01:33:17.490 --> 01:33:20.654
Stay in your car, please.
There's nothing to look at.

01:33:20.722 --> 01:33:22.762
We'll have it cleaned up
in a couple minutes.

01:33:25.969 --> 01:33:28.042
Get back in your car, sir.

01:33:29.874 --> 01:33:32.591
Officer, there's a woman being killed
in that Ford Bronco right there.

01:33:34.194 --> 01:33:36.780
He's killing her. He just hit her
in the back of the head.

01:33:36.850 --> 01:33:38.508
We gotta do something
to help her.

01:33:38.578 --> 01:33:42.288
- Get back in your car.
- He's killing her. He hit her.

01:33:43.890 --> 01:33:46.345
- I don't have time to run you in.
- Please!

01:33:46.418 --> 01:33:48.458
He's getting away.
Please call somebody on your radio.

01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:51.377
Don't you understand?
I saw him killing her!

01:33:51.442 --> 01:33:53.809
- You fucking idiot!
- All right, that's it, buddy.

01:33:53.874 --> 01:33:56.208
- You're coming with me.
- Call Detective McLean.

01:33:56.274 --> 01:33:57.965
- He knows all about this.
- All right.

01:33:59.474 --> 01:34:01.230
Son of a...

01:34:01.298 --> 01:34:02.988
Come here, you son of a bitch!

01:38:12.913 --> 01:38:14.288
Are you okay?

01:39:29.234 --> 01:39:30.761
Look what you did.

01:39:32.434 --> 01:39:35.401
You ruined my surprise ending!

01:39:35.473 --> 01:39:40.208
I gave you your part:
the witness.

01:39:40.273 --> 01:39:43.950
You were perfect.
You played it to a T.

01:39:44.017 --> 01:39:46.439
But that was it.

01:39:46.514 --> 01:39:47.888
End of part.

01:39:49.073 --> 01:39:50.928
Wrap Jake Scully.

01:39:54.481 --> 01:39:56.685
You had to play the hero...

01:39:56.753 --> 01:40:00.365
improvise all this crap
about finding a body double...

01:40:00.433 --> 01:40:02.921
and unmasking the Indian.

01:40:05.874 --> 01:40:08.427
But you didn't think it through.

01:40:08.498 --> 01:40:12.971
Sometimes heroes
come to tragic ends.

01:40:14.354 --> 01:40:17.801
What's the matter?
A little short of breath?

01:40:20.722 --> 01:40:22.347
What a terrible way to die.

01:40:23.729 --> 01:40:25.671
Especially when you're
so claustrophobic.

01:40:26.738 --> 01:40:28.112
Wait a minute.

01:40:28.177 --> 01:40:30.894
I'll give you another take.

01:40:33.137 --> 01:40:36.520
The only problem is
you've got to act.

01:40:42.577 --> 01:40:43.952
Come on.

01:40:44.593 --> 01:40:46.481
Action.

01:40:51.538 --> 01:40:52.912
And action.

01:41:00.786 --> 01:41:02.760
Cut. Get him out of here.
Move the camera out.

01:41:02.833 --> 01:41:05.070
Joe, give me a hand.
Jake, take it easy.

01:41:05.138 --> 01:41:07.047
What's going on?

01:41:07.121 --> 01:41:08.976
We're getting you out.
That's all right.

01:41:09.041 --> 01:41:10.896
We got you. Let go.
Don't worry about it.

01:41:10.961 --> 01:41:13.449
- Don't worry about nothing.
- It's all right. We're here.

01:41:13.522 --> 01:41:16.653
Give him some air.
Talk to me.

01:41:16.721 --> 01:41:19.820
Say something.
Walk it off. Just go for a walk.

01:41:19.890 --> 01:41:22.159
Just relax. Just breathe in.

01:41:22.226 --> 01:41:24.811
All right, that's good.
There you go.

01:41:24.881 --> 01:41:26.736
What's the matter, babe?

01:41:26.801 --> 01:41:30.282
Boy, you had us scared there.
What's the problem?

01:41:30.354 --> 01:41:32.209
Wait a minute.

01:41:36.562 --> 01:41:39.529
- Get away from me.
- Babe, just relax.

01:41:39.602 --> 01:41:41.609
- We're just trying to help you.
- I know.

01:41:41.681 --> 01:41:44.398
I can help myself.

01:41:44.465 --> 01:41:48.589
Listen, Scully,
why don't you cool off?

01:41:48.657 --> 01:41:52.137
Go on home,
and we'll shoot this another time.

01:41:52.209 --> 01:41:53.584
All right?

01:41:55.537 --> 01:41:57.610
Don't lie to me.

01:41:57.682 --> 01:41:59.853
If I don't get this shot,
you'll fire me.

01:42:01.553 --> 01:42:04.488
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would I do a thing like that?

01:42:11.474 --> 01:42:16.013
Save the speech, Rubin. I know all about
your personal commitment to the actors.

01:42:16.082 --> 01:42:19.529
I'm a little claustrophobic.
You’ll work around it, right?

01:42:19.601 --> 01:42:21.456
Yeah, that's right.

01:42:25.297 --> 01:42:27.402
- I don't like your attitude.
- Yeah?

01:42:27.473 --> 01:42:30.768
If I get this shot,
you'll like it a lot better, right?

01:42:42.962 --> 01:42:44.336
Let's do it!

01:42:52.785 --> 01:42:55.174
You better get it right this time.

01:42:55.249 --> 01:42:57.802
You're one pain in the ass
I don't need.

01:42:59.921 --> 01:43:02.572
- Okay, Joe.
- Roll sound. Quiet.

01:43:02.641 --> 01:43:04.812
And action I

01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:13.777
You bastard!

01:43:13.841 --> 01:43:15.401
Don't be so melodramatic.

01:43:20.593 --> 01:43:22.088
Kill!

01:43:32.561 --> 01:43:34.634
What are you doing?

01:43:34.706 --> 01:43:37.226
- What am I doing? I'm saving you.
- From who?

01:43:37.297 --> 01:43:42.447
- From... The Indian was Sam Bouchard.
- Wait a minute.

01:43:42.513 --> 01:43:45.547
Am I missing something?
Is there somebody here that I don't see?

01:43:45.618 --> 01:43:47.690
Yes! The dog knocked him in.

01:43:47.761 --> 01:43:49.616
Come look. Come here.

01:43:50.770 --> 01:43:53.006
Look, he must have knocked him in.
He went...

01:43:53.073 --> 01:43:57.678
I thought it belonged to Gloria, but
it must have belonged to the husband.

01:43:57.746 --> 01:44:01.226
That's why he never barked at the Indian
when he tried to sneak in the house.

01:44:01.297 --> 01:44:03.883
I think you're absolutely right.
We should go to the police.

01:44:03.954 --> 01:44:06.255
- Really? You believe me?
- Yes. I believe you.

01:44:06.321 --> 01:44:09.704
I believe you are a number one sicko
and should be put away for life!

01:44:09.777 --> 01:44:11.981
I know all about you guys.

01:44:12.049 --> 01:44:14.896
I've seen about you
on late-night television.

01:44:14.961 --> 01:44:17.383
You're one of those necrophiliacs,
a corpse fucker!

01:44:17.457 --> 01:44:19.878
- I am not.
- Yes! I turn you on, all right.

01:44:19.953 --> 01:44:21.863
The only problem is that
I'm still moving!

01:44:21.938 --> 01:44:24.393
Unconscious is good,
but dead is better, right?

01:44:26.513 --> 01:44:27.887
Are you all right?

01:44:28.914 --> 01:44:30.288
Here, take my hand.

01:44:31.217 --> 01:44:33.006
Do not touch me.

01:44:33.073 --> 01:44:35.375
I'm not dead yet.

01:44:38.257 --> 01:44:43.080
I know this all seems crazy,
but I'm trying to help you.

01:44:43.153 --> 01:44:45.968
Are you gonna stay in there
for the rest of your life?

01:45:28.594 --> 01:45:30.448
Freeze.
Don't move your hand, Jake.

01:45:30.514 --> 01:45:32.040
- How does that look?
- It looks great.

01:45:32.113 --> 01:45:35.561
Good. Terrific. Hold that move.
Let's 86 the bat.

01:45:35.633 --> 01:45:38.764
That's a wrap on the bat.
Get the bat out.

01:45:38.833 --> 01:45:41.965
- I gotta hold the hand really still.
- Help him out.

01:45:42.034 --> 01:45:45.329
- Turn the water off.
- Can I slip out?

01:45:45.393 --> 01:45:48.524
Wait till we get the bar in there.
Wait till we get the stand in here.

01:45:48.593 --> 01:45:52.522
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Between the bottom two fingers.

01:45:56.753 --> 01:45:59.404
Good. Okay, sweetheart,
you can slide out.

01:45:59.473 --> 01:46:01.644
Don't move the hand.
Freeze the hand.

01:46:01.713 --> 01:46:03.568
Makeup.
Let's get a touch-up for Jake.

01:46:03.633 --> 01:46:05.967
Don't move the hand.
Keep the hand very still.

01:46:06.034 --> 01:46:07.560
Excuse me.

01:46:07.633 --> 01:46:09.488
Don't move the bar!

01:46:11.313 --> 01:46:13.004
- I'm sorry.
- Did the bar move?

01:46:13.073 --> 01:46:14.447
That's okay.

01:46:15.889 --> 01:46:18.606
- You're doing a great job.
- Did I flash the teeth long enough?

01:46:18.673 --> 01:46:21.968
Best teeth flashing I've ever seen.
It looked beautiful, babe.

01:46:22.033 --> 01:46:23.888
I'm so glad
I fired that other asshole.

01:46:23.953 --> 01:46:26.921
This part was made for you.
I mean it. You look sensational.

01:46:26.993 --> 01:46:29.961
- This bar is falling.
- That looks good.

01:46:30.034 --> 01:46:31.560
- You holding up?
- Yeah.

01:46:31.633 --> 01:46:34.121
Just a little longer.
Okay, girls, step out. Step back.

01:46:34.193 --> 01:46:36.048
Let's bring in the body double.

01:46:36.113 --> 01:46:38.601
- Thanks.
- The hair looks good.

01:46:38.674 --> 01:46:40.845
Is that as hot
as that water gets?

01:46:40.913 --> 01:46:42.768
Slide in there, sweetheart.

01:46:42.833 --> 01:46:45.484
- Don't move the bar. It's important.
- I know.

01:46:45.553 --> 01:46:48.204
Hi. I'm Mindy.
Pleased to meet you.

01:46:48.274 --> 01:46:51.241
- Nice to meet you.
- Listen, be very, very careful.

01:46:51.313 --> 01:46:53.320
My breasts are very tender.

01:46:53.393 --> 01:46:55.084
I've got my period.

01:46:56.273 --> 01:46:57.647
We good here?

01:46:59.633 --> 01:47:02.765
I'm gonna...
Just bring your body up like this.

01:47:02.833 --> 01:47:04.688
My hand is right here.
I can't move my hand.

01:47:04.753 --> 01:47:07.241
Keep your hand exactly still.
Let's shoot it.

01:47:07.313 --> 01:47:09.485
Let's slide the bar out.

01:47:09.553 --> 01:47:11.724
Drop the camera.
Let's get the camera down.

01:47:13.073 --> 01:47:15.561
Wait till we're in position.

01:47:15.633 --> 01:47:17.324
Can you bring your body
up to my hand?

01:47:21.713 --> 01:47:24.430
Quiet, please!
I'm trying to think.

01:47:38.033 --> 01:47:40.848
You're gonna get a lot of dates
when this comes out.

01:47:40.913 --> 01:47:42.440
Here we go. Action.

01:47:42.513 --> 01:47:44.040
Action with the hand.

01:47:46.834 --> 01:47:49.005
Great action.

01:47:49.073 --> 01:47:50.928
Is that too hard?
