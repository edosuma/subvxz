00:36.327 --> 00:39.080
It's a safe space, So anything you'd like to say,

00:39.080 --> 00:40.373
don't want to say

00:40.373 --> 00:41.916
It’s your time, So.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.294
Hey Richard.

00:45.378 --> 00:50.383
Okay, we want to just go around and say
something about our week.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.426
Yeah, Sure.

00:51.426 --> 00:52.135
Great.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.554
I'm Scott. I'm an alcoholic.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.263
Hey Scott.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.725
Hey, I have a few years under my belt

00:58.725 --> 01:01.436
and my daughter told me she's getting divorced.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.272
So I've had a few drinks

01:04.272 --> 01:07.734
and not feeling good about it, but I'm back. So.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.110
Thanks.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.446
Hey, my name's Kyle I’m an alcoholic.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.322
Hey Kyle.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.948
Working girlfriend got the best of me.

01:13.948 --> 01:18.203
So hit the bar and blacked out... I’m back here.

01:21.372 --> 01:22.999
My name is Ron. I'm an alcoholic

01:22.999 --> 01:25.168
and probation officer said that I had to be here,

01:25.168 --> 01:27.629
get something signed off so I can complete my probation.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.713
That's why I'm here.

01:28.713 --> 01:29.672
Richard?

01:31.925 --> 01:32.884
Richard?

01:34.010 --> 01:35.887
Do you want to say anything about your week?

01:37.972 --> 01:39.098
Well uhh...

01:43.144 --> 01:44.229
I'm sorry.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.293
Stop it Richard, Stop it.

02:07.627 --> 02:08.502
Breath.

02:08.919 --> 02:09.920
Breath.

02:10.713 --> 02:11.714
That's it.

02:37.657 --> 02:38.700
Haley?

04:35.525 --> 04:36.484
Yep.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.111
Okay.

04:42.573 --> 04:43.866
I'll call you back.

05:28.494 --> 05:28.953
Hey.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.288
Is that for me?

05:31.122 --> 05:32.331
Well I was going to bring it to the pool,

05:32.331 --> 05:34.000
but I didn't want to risk spilling it.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.168
You remember last time?

05:37.336 --> 05:39.255
Well, at least I get to drink it this time.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.925
I had that dream again.

05:43.676 --> 05:44.427
Again?

05:45.303 --> 05:45.803
Yeah.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.513
well, it's probably nothing.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.348
I gotta go get changed.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.518
(FROM TV)
He killed them all.

05:52.518 --> 05:53.686
(FROM TV)
Are you Sure?

05:54.145 --> 05:55.438
(FROM TV)
Yes i'm Sure.

05:56.105 --> 05:59.525
(From TV)
Tex wrote the word dyle before he died.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.821
(FROM TV)
He's the murderer I tell you.

06:03.821 --> 06:06.157
(FROM TV)
Now wait a minute, jus ta minute Mrs. Lampert but...

06:06.157 --> 06:08.076
(FROM TV)
You better give that to me again.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.036
Honey, have you seen my script?

06:11.370 --> 06:13.206
I thought your callback wasn't until Tuesday?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.123
Yeah, it wasn't.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.000
But they called me this morning and they changed the date.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.502
Must have left it in the dining room.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.378
Was it the same one you audition for last week?

06:19.378 --> 06:20.546
Yeah, horror!

06:23.257 --> 06:24.133
Found it.

06:26.719 --> 06:27.720
What, no kiss?

06:29.305 --> 06:30.431
Got to go hun.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.905
Her skin was delegate, perfect.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.699
A virgin olive within which

06:48.699 --> 06:51.661
a dark pit hit thoughts which he could never know.

06:51.661 --> 06:55.081
In her eyes live secrets that would never escape her lips.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.250
She was Fire and Ice.

06:57.750 --> 07:01.254
Her smile warm enough to stroke the embers of his heart.

07:01.504 --> 07:05.049
Her absence a cold reminder of what
he would never truly have.

07:05.550 --> 07:08.803
She was the love of his life.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.974
He said you told him to come by

07:12.974 --> 07:14.809
to celebrate my birthday.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.811
He even brought a gift as a surprise,

07:16.811 --> 07:18.229
but I just invited him in

07:18.229 --> 07:20.606
and we were having a couple of drinks

07:20.606 --> 07:22.024
Until I opened the gift.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.278
He said he’s been in love with me for a long time.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.529
What!?

07:27.572 --> 07:29.740
I don't know, I told him I wasn't interested,

07:29.740 --> 07:31.993
but he wouldn't take no for an answer.

07:32.743 --> 07:35.788
So he pushed me onto the kitchen counter

07:36.289 --> 07:37.832
and he forced himself on to me

07:37.832 --> 07:39.125
and I just couldn’t get him off.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.378
I was screaming, but he was smothering me.

07:43.546 --> 07:44.839
Where is he now?

07:45.756 --> 07:48.551
He's, he’s in the kitchen.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.366
Hello?

08:13.951 --> 08:14.785
Did you?

08:16.704 --> 08:17.705
I miss you too.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.125
I'm on my way home. I'll talk to you later.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.385
Hey.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.638
I picked up some food on the way home.

08:38.808 --> 08:39.644
Honey?

08:40.519 --> 08:41.979
What would you think about

08:42.355 --> 08:43.272
going away?

08:43.981 --> 08:44.857
Away?

08:44.857 --> 08:47.526
Yeah, we could rent a beach cottage for a couple of weeks.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.612
Maybe go to a Resort.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.447
What about your novel?

08:52.073 --> 08:53.157
What about my novel?

08:53.741 --> 08:55.451
Well you said you wanted to finish it here

08:55.451 --> 08:56.702
and besides if I book the part

08:56.702 --> 08:58.871
I'm going to have to stay here for a while.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.831
Oh, so you're saying you never want to go away?

09:00.831 --> 09:02.208
That's not what I'm saying Richard.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.168
It's just that now is not the time.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.712
And when is the time?

09:07.129 --> 09:08.965
I just want to book a really big part first

09:08.965 --> 09:11.259
and then we can talk about going somewhere.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.642
He had given her everything he had,

10:02.059 --> 10:03.311
but no amount of sacrifice

10:03.311 --> 10:06.230
could fill the emptiness that consumed the house.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.234
It was a thick fog that dampened everything it touched.

10:11.193 --> 10:12.236
On the outside,

10:12.236 --> 10:13.904
their house seemed perfect,

10:14.363 --> 10:16.240
but it would never be a home.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.209
Richard I'm going to jail.

10:27.209 --> 10:27.918
No you're not.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.045
I'm not going to let that happen.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.379
Shh...Shh...Shh...
Oh my god!

10:30.379 --> 10:32.631
Okay it was self-defense, he's gone now.

10:32.631 --> 10:35.593
No no you don’t understand.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.386
After his skull cracked,

10:38.471 --> 10:40.348
I kept hitting him and hitting him again

10:40.348 --> 10:42.058
and again with the figurine.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.726
Oh my god.
It's okay.

10:43.726 --> 10:44.769
Shh...Shh...Shh...

10:45.853 --> 10:47.938
How did he know It was my birthday Richard?

10:47.938 --> 10:49.982
I don't undrestant what he was doing here.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.568
How did he know It was my birthday Richard?

10:52.902 --> 10:54.278
I don't understand!

10:54.278 --> 10:55.196
No I don’t know!

10:55.196 --> 10:56.697
I DON'T KNOW!

11:01.869 --> 11:03.621
Are you okay Richard?

11:04.663 --> 11:06.165
Let me grab your pills.

11:21.931 --> 11:22.973
Here.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.533
We’ll bury the body.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.744
What?! Richard why.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.788
Well you have any better ideas?

11:46.497 --> 11:47.665
Richard No!

11:47.665 --> 11:49.667
Honey listen to me.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.876
He doesn't have a family.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.253
He doesn't even have a car okay?

11:52.253 --> 11:54.505
We're going to bury the body because it's our best option.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.715
What are you talking about?

11:58.467 --> 12:00.428
Has anyone seen you with him tonight?

12:00.428 --> 12:01.637
I don't know Richard.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.931
Honey It's either a yes or a no.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.683
Has anyone seen you with him?

12:05.683 --> 12:06.517
No

12:06.517 --> 12:09.019
Okay, Alright, I want you to go upstairs.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.188
I want you to get cleaned up Okay?

12:11.188 --> 12:12.565
I'm going to fix this up.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.785
Matt Saunders. Good to see you again.

13:06.785 --> 13:07.536
How is it going Richard?

13:07.536 --> 13:08.579
Going great, come on in.

13:08.579 --> 13:09.205
Thanks.

13:13.834 --> 13:14.752
Come in.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.296
Still writing those novels?

13:17.922 --> 13:20.299
Actually, I just started a new book.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.717
We have a lady here to see you.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.052
Does she have an appointment?

13:23.052 --> 13:23.969
No.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.638
She says she's Richard's wife.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.976
Okay. Tell her to come in.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.066
Hey, what happened to your liquor cabinet?

13:38.025 --> 13:38.943
A what?

13:38.943 --> 13:41.946
Didn't you have a liquor cabinet here before?

13:41.946 --> 13:43.489
Oh, yeah, we took it down

13:43.864 --> 13:45.282
Haley didn't like you drinking.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.283
It wasn't Haley.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.035
It was me.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.121
Well in case you're wondering

13:51.121 --> 13:53.457
I joined an AA group three years ago.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.668
I wasn't going to say anything but...

13:56.585 --> 13:58.128
you're looking a little rough.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.548
How about I come back and get you in shape?

14:02.508 --> 14:03.676
How's life treating you?

14:05.386 --> 14:06.470
Been better.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.432
Personal training has taken a dive and...

14:11.267 --> 14:13.102
Single and broke.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.521
You playing alone?

14:16.605 --> 14:17.481
No.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.151
Richard are you okay?

14:22.528 --> 14:23.779
No, I'm not Matt.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.406
Haley!

14:25.823 --> 14:27.825
What an unexpected surprise.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.704
I know. I'm sorry.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.831
I just really needed to see you.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.291
What's going on?

14:36.333 --> 14:39.420
Well, besides the fact that my new book
is messing with my head.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.131
It's this house.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.592
The house?

14:44.592 --> 14:45.926
You know, I originally. I bought this place...

14:46.510 --> 14:47.761
to inspire my writing.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.889
See...It turns out that there was a young couple

14:50.889 --> 14:53.642
that used to live here before Haley and I.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.062
Apparently the husband came home one night

14:57.062 --> 14:59.356
and found his wife in bed with another man.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.486
In full rage he killed them both with a butcher knife.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.951
Later on the police found him in the bathtub

15:11.493 --> 15:12.870
holding a toaster.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.334
Jesus Christ!

15:19.501 --> 15:20.878
Does Haley know about this?

15:22.338 --> 15:23.464
It's Richard.

15:24.506 --> 15:27.593
Look, Nick...can we keep this just between us?

15:27.593 --> 15:28.719
Of course.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.264
What's going on Richard? Why uhh...why

15:32.264 --> 15:33.098
If you don't want personal training

15:33.098 --> 15:34.433
why did you bring me here?

15:35.809 --> 15:37.519
You may not know this but...

15:37.519 --> 15:39.313
My marriage to Haley is on the Rocks.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.023
We've been married...

15:41.440 --> 15:43.108
five years and...

15:43.942 --> 15:45.361
The relationship is just...

15:45.903 --> 15:46.737
Cold.

15:47.071 --> 15:47.696
Cold, how?

15:47.696 --> 15:49.531
Well for starters, I'm convinced.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.158
She's no longer in love with me.

15:51.158 --> 15:53.869
Something's happening to Richard and it's scaring me.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.788
He's becoming more and more paranoid

15:55.788 --> 15:58.791
and he's getting these obsessions

15:58.791 --> 16:00.459
and I don't know

16:00.459 --> 16:01.752
you've known him longer than I have.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.837
Is there something I'm supposed to do?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.049
I'm sorry to break it to you Haley,

16:07.049 --> 16:09.176
but that's just the way writers are.

16:09.718 --> 16:10.511
Imagination...

16:11.804 --> 16:12.930
powerful thing

16:12.930 --> 16:15.265
I'm not against the idea of her having a career

16:15.265 --> 16:17.309
as an actress or whatever.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.813
It's just that it's been non-stop
with auditions and rehearsals

16:20.813 --> 16:23.816
with actors, writers directors.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.860
and I never know where she's at.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.822
So you think she's cheating on you?

16:29.822 --> 16:30.781
Don't get me wrong.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.366
I love Richard with all of my heart

16:32.366 --> 16:34.118
but not if things don't get better.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.204
I mean, I feel like I've been really supportive.

16:37.204 --> 16:38.872
Of everything that he's put me through

16:38.872 --> 16:41.583
his drinking problems, his obsessions with the house.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.043
I want to make you an offer.

16:44.795 --> 16:45.546
An offer?

16:46.255 --> 16:47.464
To put it more simply,

16:47.923 --> 16:49.591
I know you need money

16:50.426 --> 16:51.385
and I have it.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.679
Okay, what kind of offer are we talking about?

16:54.847 --> 16:56.265
Has he been drinking again?

16:57.808 --> 16:58.642
No.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.812
Well then things have gotten better.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.231
Well how does $15,000 sound?

17:06.066 --> 17:08.359
$15,000 sounds fucking awesome.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.112
What for?

17:10.695 --> 17:12.448
I can't prove right now whether or not

17:12.948 --> 17:14.657
Haley is sleeping with another man.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.035
but I can prove whether or not

17:17.035 --> 17:18.787
she can be tempted to do so.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.039
We both know Richard has his demons,

17:21.039 --> 17:23.250
but I've known that man for 20 years

17:23.250 --> 17:25.085
he always gets back on his feet.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.252
Trust me.

17:30.048 --> 17:33.010
You want to pay me $15,000 to seduce your wife?

17:33.385 --> 17:34.386
Are you kidding?

17:35.721 --> 17:37.806
Don't tell me you've never seduced a woman before.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.641
Yeah, I've seduced a woman

17:39.641 --> 17:42.186
just not for money.

17:42.644 --> 17:43.896
Now listen, if you're interested,

17:44.271 --> 17:45.606
here's my plan.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.734
I want to start off by calling the house

17:48.734 --> 17:50.319
Tuesday night around seven o'clock

17:51.153 --> 17:52.154
I'll know it's you

17:52.154 --> 17:53.989
and I'm going to let Hayley answer the phone.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.200
Okay, and what do I say?

17:56.533 --> 17:58.202
Start by telling her that you remember her

17:58.202 --> 17:59.369
She's got a birthday coming up

17:59.369 --> 18:01.038
and then just ask to speak with me.

18:01.038 --> 18:01.997
Haley I don't know what to tell you.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.082
These are just the Ebbs and flows of marriage.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.375
You know.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.752
The important detail is.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.171
Do you still really love him?

18:10.130 --> 18:12.174
Sometimes It's not that simple Nick.

18:12.674 --> 18:13.884
Love isn't enough.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.180
Then you need to pass by Saturday night

18:18.180 --> 18:20.516
and make sure you bring a birthday gift.

18:20.891 --> 18:21.850
We she comes to the door.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.644
Just tell her you messed up on the

18:23.644 --> 18:25.270
date for the training session.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.481
I'm going to be at my AA meeting

18:27.481 --> 18:28.899
until about 10 o'clock.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.275
You just wantme to roll up to your house

18:30.275 --> 18:34.071
with some random gift and just ask her hey...

18:34.071 --> 18:35.030
Do you have a lover?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.575
Get her to open up about her marriage.

18:39.409 --> 18:40.744
And what if she doesn't?

18:41.745 --> 18:42.538
Seduce her.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.210
You know what?

18:49.169 --> 18:51.004
I'm sorry, I've taken up too much of your time.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.214
I should go.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.926
Alright. Well, I hope it all works out.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.272
Well...

19:09.022 --> 19:10.274
This is nuts um...

19:19.741 --> 19:20.742
I’ll do it.

20:13.670 --> 20:14.421
Your clothes.

20:14.671 --> 20:15.339
It's nothing.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.174
Are you okay?

20:17.758 --> 20:19.635
No, no I don't feel good.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.263
Richard.

20:59.049 --> 20:59.716
Hey.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.221
So...

21:06.014 --> 21:08.350
look I know this looks really bad.

21:12.896 --> 21:15.983
But why didn't you say that you saved this?

21:18.402 --> 21:19.987
Of course I saved it Richard.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.530
I always keep that with me.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.035
I really need to get ready.

22:17.377 --> 22:18.462
Sorry I'm late.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.672
That's alright, have a seat Richard.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.055
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.973
Publishers sent a list of books

22:29.973 --> 22:30.974
that are going to be re-released next year

22:30.974 --> 22:32.851
take into account the lack of titles.

22:33.935 --> 22:35.103
Your books aren't on it .

22:36.271 --> 22:37.272
I'm sorry Richard.

22:38.106 --> 22:39.191
No, I get it.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.110
You're an amazing author.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.822
But you haven't given me anything viable in the last...

22:46.907 --> 22:47.908
four years.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.327
Actually that's what I came to talk to you about.

22:51.369 --> 22:52.204
I've got something.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.413
Well, let's see it.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.295
I've only written the synopsis so far.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.056
I'm thinking of calling it "The Perception".

23:12.641 --> 23:13.642
This is different.

23:14.434 --> 23:15.977
I was hoping you were going to say that.

23:17.145 --> 23:18.438
Intriving!

23:23.276 --> 23:24.361
This sounds familiar.

23:25.654 --> 23:26.321
What do you mean?

23:26.571 --> 23:29.116
Did you draw inspiration from anything?

23:30.408 --> 23:31.743
Are you trying to imply something?

23:31.743 --> 23:34.162
Lookwait, I don't mean to pry but...

23:35.330 --> 23:36.456
Is everything allright?

23:37.666 --> 23:39.376
Yeah, everything's fine.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.839
This story sounds promising.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.090
Oh thank you.

23:45.715 --> 23:48.009
It’s been quite a journey.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.261
How does it end?

23:50.387 --> 23:51.012
Well...

23:51.012 --> 23:52.264
Actually I'm not sure yet.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.558
I'm waiting for things to unfold.

23:57.602 --> 23:58.603
Richard!

24:00.063 --> 24:01.648
Wake up, Richard.

24:02.524 --> 24:03.567
Richard wake up.

24:03.984 --> 24:04.818
Wake up!

24:04.818 --> 24:06.278
Richard! Richard!

24:46.776 --> 24:48.153
I made you a special dinner.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.488
Well what's the special occasion?

24:53.450 --> 24:54.743
I got the part.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.286
Get over here

24:57.204 --> 24:59.331
Haley, Congratulations honey.

25:00.790 --> 25:01.583
What?

25:02.834 --> 25:05.212
You look more sophisticated like that with your hair back.

25:06.087 --> 25:07.672
Don't I always look Sophisticated?

25:08.089 --> 25:09.257
You wish.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.259
Finish your dinner.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.616
What’s my husband up to?

25:34.616 --> 25:35.408
Husband?

25:35.867 --> 25:37.410
What?

25:37.410 --> 25:39.913
It’s been a long time since you called me that.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.998
Well,you are, aren't you?

25:42.832 --> 25:43.500
Well...

25:44.084 --> 25:45.543
It’s been quite an amazing day.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.505
Do you want to make it more amazing?

26:24.958 --> 26:26.835
Almost gave up on you.

26:30.213 --> 26:31.131
But you didn't.

26:35.302 --> 26:36.845
Remember when we first met?

26:38.930 --> 26:41.641
You were so romantic on our first date.

26:44.185 --> 26:46.104
I want to be that guy again.

26:48.148 --> 26:49.441
I miss him.

27:17.177 --> 27:17.761
Hey.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.140
What happened?

27:22.515 --> 27:23.516
You passed out.

27:26.644 --> 27:27.896
What about the body?

27:28.229 --> 27:29.439
I buried it.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.399
By yourself?

27:32.400 --> 27:33.902
I didn’t have a choice.

27:34.110 --> 27:36.529
It was just lying there and you wouldn’t wake up.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.156
You should have woke me up.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.575
You passed out and I was really stressed out

27:40.575 --> 27:42.952
and I just wanted to get it over and done with.

28:22.826 --> 28:23.451
Hello?

28:23.451 --> 28:24.494
It's Richard.

28:24.744 --> 28:25.286
Hey.

28:25.662 --> 28:28.665
I called at seven like you asked and no one answered.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.335
Listen, I got to call the whole thing off.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.086
What?!

28:33.086 --> 28:35.088
I think my marriage had a turning point

28:35.088 --> 28:36.840
and I'm starting to believe that...

28:36.840 --> 28:38.091
You can't call it off.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.176
Matt as I was saying.

28:40.176 --> 28:41.010
I think my marriage...

28:41.010 --> 28:41.928
I don't care what you're thinking

28:41.928 --> 28:42.887
deal is a deal.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.472
And I'm telling you the deal is off.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.307
No, no, no...

28:46.307 --> 28:47.725
Richard you can't do this to me.

28:48.476 --> 28:49.644
I need that money.

28:50.145 --> 28:50.895
Matt...

28:51.146 --> 28:53.148
$15,000 is nothing to you.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.274
You know what, I'm hanging up.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.650
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait...

28:55.650 --> 28:57.110
Okay fine., We can call the whole deal off

28:57.110 --> 28:58.862
but you at least need to pay me for the other day.

28:59.195 --> 29:00.196
The other day?

29:01.156 --> 29:03.283
Matt you came over for a chat.

29:03.283 --> 29:04.951
That's not worth any money.

29:04.951 --> 29:06.327
Are you fucking kidding me?

29:06.327 --> 29:08.413
Listen you’re fucking with the wrong person.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.582
Look I will take everything from you.

29:10.957 --> 29:12.750
Alright? Fucking everything.

29:38.276 --> 29:41.779
After braving a seemingly endless and unforgiving winter.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.365
A single Ray of sunlight pierce the clouds

29:44.365 --> 29:46.618
as it begin to thaw the ice between them.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.455
What relief, she was there.

29:50.455 --> 29:54.000
A blazing Beacon daring him to hope once more.

29:57.879 --> 30:00.882
(FROM TV)
No Matter How guilty she was.

30:01.549 --> 30:04.594
(FROM TV)
Two accidental deaths in 12 hours.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.054
(FROM TV)
I don’t believe it.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.013
(FROM TV)
Alright.

30:07.889 --> 30:08.681
Guess what.

30:08.681 --> 30:09.307
What?

30:09.307 --> 30:11.976
The director got a new writer who changed all the lines.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.144
So I'm going to have to forget

30:13.144 --> 30:14.479
all the lines I already learned.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.273
It's no big deal, is it?

30:17.273 --> 30:18.274
I guess not.

30:18.816 --> 30:20.652
Have'nt you got an AA meeting tonight?

30:21.069 --> 30:23.196
I was thinking of not going.

30:23.196 --> 30:24.322
Why not?

30:26.032 --> 30:27.116
I don't know, I just...

30:28.159 --> 30:29.536
People show up and all they do is

30:29.536 --> 30:31.287
whine for the whole session and...

30:31.829 --> 30:33.414
It's just... It's depressing.

30:33.414 --> 30:34.958
Richard, you know you need to go

30:34.958 --> 30:38.044
and besides I have all these new lines i have to learn.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.088
So I could do with some peace and quiet.

30:40.755 --> 30:41.506
Quiet?

30:42.340 --> 30:43.550
Richard.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.385
Alright, I'll go.

30:45.635 --> 30:46.636
(FROM TV)
Murder.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.049
Come on!

32:18.686 --> 32:21.648
You want to pay me $ 15,000 to seduce your wife?

32:22.148 --> 32:22.982
Are you kidding?

32:23.941 --> 32:25.610
Start by telling her that you remember her

32:25.610 --> 32:26.861
she's got a birthday coming up

32:26.861 --> 32:28.112
and just ask to speak with me.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.990
Richard you can't do this to me, I need that money.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.325
To seduce your wife?

32:34.327 --> 32:36.496
Then you need to pass by Saturday night.

32:36.954 --> 32:38.790
And make sure you bring a birthday gift.

32:39.415 --> 32:42.210
It's a safe space so Anything you like to say,

32:43.419 --> 32:44.420
It's your time.

32:44.504 --> 32:45.296
Please.

32:45.296 --> 32:46.547
I'm Scott, an alcoholic.

32:47.131 --> 32:47.840
Hey Scott.

32:49.926 --> 32:50.927
I have a few years...

32:52.053 --> 32:52.970
I'll tell Haley,

32:53.054 --> 32:54.472
I'll tell her you invited me to the house

32:54.472 --> 32:56.224
and offered me $15,000

32:56.224 --> 32:57.558
that you're trying to get me to seduce her.

32:57.558 --> 32:58.643
you're trying to set her up.

32:59.769 --> 33:00.770
I'm an alcoholic.

33:05.525 --> 33:06.776
Fuck you man, fuck you.

33:06.776 --> 33:09.112
I will take everything from you, you understand me?

33:09.112 --> 33:10.113
Everything from you.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.157
Richard?

33:14.242 --> 33:16.160
Do you want to say anything about your week?

33:18.246 --> 33:19.247
Well uhh...

33:22.625 --> 33:23.418
I'm sorry.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.336
Are you coming to bed?

36:13.045 --> 36:14.130
Yeah, soon.

36:15.214 --> 36:16.007
Richard...

36:18.092 --> 36:19.719
I don't want to be alone right now.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.681
It's going to be okay hun, we're going to be fine.

37:23.950 --> 37:24.784
Haley?

37:48.641 --> 37:49.183
Hey.

37:49.433 --> 37:50.226
Where are you?

37:51.060 --> 37:51.978
I'm on set.

37:52.269 --> 37:54.230
How can you be at work at a time like this?

37:54.230 --> 37:55.982
I had to leave the house.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.400
We need to act like nothing's happened.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.484
What do you expect me to do?

37:58.484 --> 37:59.151
Haley.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.779
Do you remember that gift that Matt brought you?

38:01.988 --> 38:03.197
What about it?

38:03.197 --> 38:04.573
I got rid of it last night.

38:04.573 --> 38:06.033
Now it's sitting on the kitchen counter.

38:06.033 --> 38:06.909
Are you sure?

38:07.201 --> 38:08.577
Are you sure you threw it away?

38:08.577 --> 38:09.829
Yes, I'm sure.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.205
Stop acting crazy.

38:11.205 --> 38:12.373
Just get rid of it.

38:12.373 --> 38:15.334
And I don't want to ever talk about this again.

38:15.334 --> 38:16.836
We need to move on.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.547
Look I've got to go, okay, bye.

38:21.257 --> 38:21.674
Haley?

39:43.380 --> 39:46.175
Yes, yes I've already got a table for six.

39:46.425 --> 39:48.719
I know, I know I'm on the way.

39:49.553 --> 39:51.263
Okay, babe I'll...

39:52.389 --> 39:53.390
I'll umm...

39:53.849 --> 39:54.642
I'll call you back.

39:54.642 --> 39:55.434
Richard.

39:55.935 --> 39:57.228
What are you doing here?

39:57.269 --> 39:58.104
Listen.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.564
Something really bad happened Okay.

40:00.564 --> 40:01.774
What's going on?

40:02.817 --> 40:05.027
I really screwed up this time, okay,

40:05.027 --> 40:05.986
and I don’t know what to do,

40:05.986 --> 40:07.238
I mean there's no one to talk to

40:07.238 --> 40:09.240
and I'm fucking losing my mind.

40:10.199 --> 40:11.575
Richard have you been drinking again?

40:11.575 --> 40:12.409
No!

40:14.912 --> 40:15.996
You say you haven't been drinking

40:15.996 --> 40:17.581
but it sounds like you have buddy.

40:17.581 --> 40:20.042
No no it has nothing to do with that.

40:24.171 --> 40:25.297
You know what?

40:25.297 --> 40:27.383
Just... just forget about.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.677
Okay Richard you’re starting to scare me buddy.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.763
Damn it talk to me.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.554
Around on the beach.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.139
He seemed quite abnormal.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.557
I know where he is.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.933
You stay here on this pay phone.

41:22.855 --> 41:25.191
(FROM TV)
You’re saying the general was behaving

41:25.316 --> 41:26.025
Hello?

41:26.025 --> 41:26.901
FROM TV)
very strange lately.

41:26.901 --> 41:27.693
Hello?

41:27.693 --> 41:28.611
(FROM TV)
out of his mind.

41:29.403 --> 41:30.279
Who is this?

41:35.659 --> 41:36.368
Did you call?

41:36.785 --> 41:37.286
What?

41:37.536 --> 41:38.537
Just now, did you call?

41:38.746 --> 41:39.371
No.

41:39.705 --> 41:40.664
Well someone did.

41:40.664 --> 41:41.624
Why is the door open?

41:41.874 --> 41:42.666
I don’t know.

41:42.875 --> 41:43.918
I didn't open it.

41:52.801 --> 41:53.802
Richard.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.930
You’re letting the cold in.

42:02.144 --> 42:03.979
Haley, about that figurine.

42:03.979 --> 42:05.606
Are you sure you didn't see it this morning?

42:05.606 --> 42:06.941
Not this again.

42:06.941 --> 42:08.275
No, just hold on a second.

42:08.275 --> 42:10.819
Okay I don't want to talk about this figurine anymore.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.364
Why are you being so nonchalant about it?

42:13.364 --> 42:15.449
I'm not being nonchalant about it Richard.

42:15.449 --> 42:17.910
I'm just tired and stressed.

42:17.910 --> 42:19.662
Oh, so you make yourself a drink.

42:19.662 --> 42:21.288
Yeah. I'm making myself a drink

42:21.288 --> 42:23.249
because I don't have a drinking problem.

42:23.249 --> 42:24.917
I haven't been drinking.

42:30.965 --> 42:31.757
Okay.

42:31.757 --> 42:33.133
I'm going to go get changed.

43:22.766 --> 43:23.600
Hello?

43:30.524 --> 43:31.525
Jesus.

43:32.192 --> 43:33.360
Been a while.

43:33.861 --> 43:35.779
Sorry to see you again.

43:38.407 --> 43:40.284
Take a fifth of Stoli.

43:42.077 --> 43:44.580
You in trouble again Richard?

43:46.040 --> 43:48.083
You look scared to me, but why?

43:49.752 --> 43:51.628
Look I don't think this is the ….

43:51.628 --> 43:53.547
You... don't... think.

43:55.007 --> 43:56.800
We'll how often do you normally think

43:56.800 --> 43:58.802
and how different is it now?

43:59.887 --> 44:01.472
You don't need vodka.

44:02.014 --> 44:04.266
You look lost to me already.

44:06.352 --> 44:08.020
You don't know me.

44:08.937 --> 44:10.898
You're just like most people

44:10.898 --> 44:13.275
believing what you see.

44:14.234 --> 44:15.527
We all do.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.246
$19.50.

44:31.585 --> 44:34.880
What did you see?

44:41.220 --> 44:44.139
Whatever you think it is, it isn’t.

44:44.848 --> 44:47.267
It's all the matter of perception.

46:32.706 --> 46:34.208
If you have to be somewhere by 8:30

46:34.208 --> 46:35.542
you better get a move on.

46:38.295 --> 46:39.213
Haley?

48:28.405 --> 48:29.323
Haley.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.825
Did you come home earlier?

48:32.909 --> 48:34.161
What are you talking about?

48:34.870 --> 48:36.413
Yeah I did come home early.

48:36.580 --> 48:39.541
No, but like after breakfast just before noon.

48:40.459 --> 48:41.918
No, why?

48:43.587 --> 48:44.963
I saw someone in the house.

48:46.632 --> 48:48.300
Really? where?

48:53.388 --> 48:54.264
In the hallway.

48:55.724 --> 48:57.684
Richard you were probably dreaming.

48:58.226 --> 49:00.145
No, I don't think this time I was dreaming.

49:00.145 --> 49:02.356
Then you were probably imagining things Richard.

49:02.356 --> 49:04.149
It's not that I don't care.

49:04.149 --> 49:08.195
It's just that we really need to get past this.

49:08.278 --> 49:08.779
Oh...

49:09.154 --> 49:11.698
And how do we move past this when

49:11.698 --> 49:14.201
there's a dead man buried in our backyard?

49:17.871 --> 49:18.538
Haley.

49:19.706 --> 49:20.707
Haley?!

49:29.883 --> 49:32.469
I'm not saying it's your fault.

49:33.178 --> 49:34.221
Because it's not.

49:34.554 --> 49:36.431
We both know it was an accident.

49:36.431 --> 49:37.974
What is it then?

49:37.974 --> 49:39.768
What I'm trying to say is

49:39.935 --> 49:42.396
There's something strange going on in this house

49:42.396 --> 49:44.356
and it's freaking me out.

49:44.815 --> 49:46.983
You really need to stop your writing.

49:46.983 --> 49:49.403
This novel it's doing your head in.

49:49.403 --> 49:50.737
Okay but Haley.

50:06.962 --> 50:08.171
Well, who is it?

50:08.171 --> 50:10.006
Probably just some kids messing around.

50:11.007 --> 50:12.509
Kids messing around?

50:13.343 --> 50:14.052
Haley.

50:14.344 --> 50:15.929
We have been here five years and

50:15.929 --> 50:18.515
I don't recall any kids messing around on our property.

50:19.182 --> 50:20.517
So what are you saying?

50:43.957 --> 50:45.041
What? A friend?

50:45.500 --> 50:46.209
Wardrobe.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.587
Then I spoke to the director afterwards.

50:49.629 --> 50:50.422
Richard.

50:50.422 --> 50:52.758
I have to go away...tomorrow.

50:53.592 --> 50:54.384
What?

50:55.093 --> 50:56.678
Yeah, they want to shoot a teaser.

50:59.306 --> 51:02.058
Would you stop being like this?

51:04.019 --> 51:04.603
Fine.

51:07.773 --> 51:09.107
I'm not going to stop you.

53:20.906 --> 53:21.907
No...No.

53:30.332 --> 53:31.666
What do you want?!

55:33.329 --> 55:35.081
Something didn't add up.

55:36.666 --> 55:38.293
His mind was a scrapyard

55:38.293 --> 55:40.420
littered with splintering images

55:40.420 --> 55:42.047
and fragmenting moments.

55:42.881 --> 55:45.091
Shattered by some unseen force

55:45.091 --> 55:47.218
and deposited randomly in the spaces

55:47.218 --> 55:49.095
between each and every thought.

55:50.680 --> 55:52.515
Yet deep inside there was a voice

55:52.766 --> 55:54.851
Challenging him to solve the puzzle.

55:56.519 --> 55:57.687
The center piece here.

55:58.188 --> 55:59.689
A corner piece there.

56:01.691 --> 56:03.193
As tit began to fit together

56:03.193 --> 56:05.195
each uniquely shape clue.

56:05.445 --> 56:06.780
One thing became certain.

56:07.739 --> 56:09.491
He wasn't loosing his mind at all.

56:10.116 --> 56:11.326
He was finding it.

56:33.765 --> 56:34.474
Hello?

56:35.225 --> 56:35.892
Nick.

56:35.892 --> 56:36.601
It's me,

56:37.352 --> 56:38.144
Richard.

56:38.645 --> 56:39.813
What time is it?

56:40.271 --> 56:41.189
I know it's late but...

56:41.189 --> 56:42.899
I got to talk to you about something.

56:44.567 --> 56:46.402
Oh man, can it wait till morning?

56:47.445 --> 56:49.572
Nick please? it's really important.

56:50.031 --> 56:51.074
Hold on.

56:55.912 --> 56:56.788
Are you still there?

56:57.163 --> 56:58.123
Yeah, I’m here.

56:58.540 --> 56:59.499
What's going on Richard?

56:59.499 --> 57:01.000
It's 4 a.m.

57:01.960 --> 57:02.877
It's my book.

57:03.461 --> 57:04.921
Jesus, that’s what you woke me for?

57:04.921 --> 57:05.713
Your book?

57:06.339 --> 57:07.674
I think I figured out the ending.

57:08.216 --> 57:10.468
Well congratulations, that's great.

57:10.468 --> 57:12.387
This isn’t just about the book Nick.

57:12.387 --> 57:13.847
This was taken from my life.

57:14.472 --> 57:15.014
What?

57:37.704 --> 57:40.373
Honey, I hope that's the last time you stay up so late.

57:42.625 --> 57:43.668
I'm glad I did.

57:45.879 --> 57:48.131
I had a breakthrough.

57:48.756 --> 57:49.883
With my writing.

57:50.341 --> 57:51.551
What does that mean?

57:52.844 --> 57:55.471
It means that it's very different from before.

57:56.723 --> 57:58.016
Only much better,

57:58.933 --> 57:59.684
I promise.

58:00.810 --> 58:02.103
I can't wait to read it.

58:02.645 --> 58:03.563
Oh you will.

58:12.614 --> 58:13.281
Hey.

58:14.449 --> 58:15.450
I'm off.

58:15.450 --> 58:16.659
What time is it?

58:16.951 --> 58:17.744
Just past eight.

58:17.744 --> 58:18.328
Yeah.

58:18.578 --> 58:21.039
I made you a jug of honey and chamomile tea.

58:21.706 --> 58:23.041
It should help you sleep better.

58:24.042 --> 58:24.626
Thanks.

58:25.710 --> 58:26.294
Bye.

58:26.836 --> 58:27.420
Bye.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:07.742
Please pick up. Come on pick up.

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:10.870
(VOICE MAIL)
The Person you have called is not available right now

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.371
(VOICE MAIL)
Please try again later.

01:03:30.097 --> 01:03:31.098
It's not real.

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:33.267
This is not...

01:03:33.267 --> 01:03:34.268
This is not real.

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:37.271
It's not real...It's not real.

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:00.461
What...What do you want from me?

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:53.931
Matt!

01:04:54.348 --> 01:04:55.266
Is he dead?

01:04:55.266 --> 01:04:56.350
I definitely heard something

01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:57.685
but I can't be sure.

01:04:57.935 --> 01:04:58.853
Want to go check it out?

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:00.354
Quit messing around.

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:01.897
You go check.

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:04.191
Fine.

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:25.296
You ready?

01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:26.255
I'm ready.

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:37.642
(PHONE CALL)
911 what's your emergency?

01:05:38.059 --> 01:05:39.685
My husband he's not breathing.

01:05:39.977 --> 01:05:41.520
I found him in the bathtub with a toaster.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.064
I think he electrocuted himself.

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:45.066
Please, I don't know what to do.

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:46.734
I'm so scared.

01:06:40.454 --> 01:06:41.497
You must be freezing.

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:42.790
You should have waited at home.

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:45.668
And be so far away from you?

01:06:49.296 --> 01:06:50.131
So what did they say?

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:51.716
They believed you?

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:54.301
They said they're going to take his body down to the morgue

01:06:54.301 --> 01:06:55.761
and run some tests.

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:57.138
What kind of test?

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.014
I don't know but it'll be fine

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:01.225
all they’re going to find is Prozac and Valium.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:05.062
Valium?

01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:06.731
Yeah.

01:07:07.022 --> 01:07:08.649
That's what I've been putting into his drinks.

01:07:12.903 --> 01:07:14.613
Let me grab your pills.

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:21.162
I can't wait to read it.

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:22.830
Oh you will.

01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:27.501
Richard always had an overactive imagination

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:29.295
killing you made it easy for him

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:31.881
to buy into the ghost stories about the house.

01:07:32.673 --> 01:07:34.884
Sneaky girl!

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:36.927
What?

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:38.804
It's just like you said.

01:07:38.804 --> 01:07:40.055
You make it sound so easy.

01:07:41.098 --> 01:07:42.683
What do you say we go away?

01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:44.977
I don't know, Richard seems to be getting better.

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:46.479
Really?

01:07:46.812 --> 01:07:48.397
That guy, is the most depressing

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:50.608
piece of shit I have ever met.

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:53.444
I need your help to find out if Haley is cheating on me.

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:54.904
Shut the fuck up.

01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:56.197
I'm going to raise the bar

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:57.948
and he's going to call the deal off tomorrow.

01:07:57.948 --> 01:07:59.617
You need to scare the shit out of him.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:01.285
I want to be that guy again.

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:02.620
I miss him.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.163
Listen, I gotta call the whole thing off.

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:05.915
I will take everything from you.

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:08.250
Alright, fucking everything.

01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:10.085
Well it was well wasn’t it?

01:08:10.377 --> 01:08:11.337
Maybe for you.

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.297
All you had to do was pretend to be dead.

01:08:13.297 --> 01:08:15.341
Pretending to be dead is harder than it looks.

01:08:44.995 --> 01:08:45.787
Excuse me matt.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:47.747
But I believe I was the star of the show.

01:08:47.747 --> 01:08:48.916
Richard wake up!

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:49.500
Richard!

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.292
Richard!

01:08:52.419 --> 01:08:53.295
How long do we have?

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:54.880
I don’t know about 30 minutes or so.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.383
Okay because there's no way he’s going to believe
that you dragged my ass downstairs.

01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:59.385
So we have to figure a way to make it belivable.

01:09:01.511 --> 01:09:02.555
What about the body?

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:04.180
I buried it.

01:09:08.894 --> 01:09:12.148
Well, once the executor finalizes everything,

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:14.108
We'll have our beach house in no time.

01:09:14.733 --> 01:09:15.901
I like that.

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:19.488
I'll be right back.

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:46.367
As he delicately tapped the last piece

01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:47.910
into the center of the puzzle,

01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:50.788
their insidious plan slid into focus.

01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:52.873
He knew that his wife and her lover

01:10:52.873 --> 01:10:55.125
intended to rid themselves of him.

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.670
To force him to the brink of his own sanity

01:10:57.836 --> 01:11:00.089
Leaving suicide as his only option.

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:08.722
Although their plan was well-conceived,

01:11:09.139 --> 01:11:12.601
the conspiring couple had overlooked one critical detail...

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:15.270
The boundless imagination of a writer.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:17.648
He had spent more than a decade

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:20.067
exploring the darkest corners of his own mind.

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:22.194
This isn't just about the book Nick.

01:11:22.194 --> 01:11:23.654
This was taken from my life.

01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:24.738
My wife and her lover

01:11:24.738 --> 01:11:27.032
they're trying to kill me or drive me to kill myself.

01:11:27.032 --> 01:11:28.075
It doesn't matter.

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:29.118
Richard?

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:30.995
Haley would never do that.

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.663
It's true. I piece it all together.

01:11:34.164 --> 01:11:35.833
Have you told anyone about this?

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.585
Human behavior had become his livelihood

01:11:38.585 --> 01:11:41.088
and he was a master in the art of manipulation.

01:11:41.296 --> 01:11:42.214
I can’t wait to read it.

01:11:42.881 --> 01:11:43.716
Oh you will.

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:46.844
A tool he employed to weave intricate storylines

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:49.054
and shape unsolvable mysteries.

01:11:50.222 --> 01:11:51.432
He had gathered enough

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:53.517
incriminating evidence to put them away

01:11:53.517 --> 01:11:54.852
for a very long time.

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:57.771
They had severely underestimated his intellect.

01:11:58.063 --> 01:11:59.690
And he took great satisfaction

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:01.400
in using it against them.

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:05.195
With limitless resources at his disposal,

01:12:05.195 --> 01:12:07.364
he was able to outsmart the conspirators

01:12:07.364 --> 01:12:09.783
without leaving a trace of Suspicion.

01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:11.785
He had injected himself with

01:12:11.785 --> 01:12:14.538
a non-lethal dose of Tetrodotoxin.

01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:17.332
Which put him into a deep state of paralysis

01:12:17.332 --> 01:12:20.502
and slowed his heartbeat to within inches of death.

01:12:24.798 --> 01:12:25.924
He knew the only way

01:12:25.924 --> 01:12:28.177
to undeniably prove their guilt

01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:30.763
was to give them exactly what they wanted.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.181
His suicide,

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:33.474
wrapped in a bow.

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:41.148
When he finally awoke,

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:42.775
the nightmare had ended

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:44.735
And a new life awaited him.

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:13.639
I sold the house.

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.682
I heard where are you moving?

01:13:15.682 --> 01:13:17.101
Somewhere North on the beach.

01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.268
Congratulations.

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:20.521
I've also got some good news.

01:13:22.272 --> 01:13:23.232
Check it out.

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:24.858
What? They changed the cover?

01:13:24.858 --> 01:13:26.735
No look at the bottom.

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.780
New York Times bestseller?

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:32.866
Yeah, the Publishers really push that true story angle.

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:35.327
I don't know what to say Nick.

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:38.413
You deserve it, after all you've been through.

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:41.125
I don't think I could have made it without your support.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.127
And you've always been there for me.

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:44.169
Thanks Nick.

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:44.920
Sure.

01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:49.007
One last thing.

01:13:50.884 --> 01:13:52.511
How much of it is true?

01:14:16.743 --> 01:14:19.037
There was an acute sense of relief

01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:20.664
that came with this knowledge.

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:23.667
Like a blister being split open

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:26.587
The truth had seeped through to the surface

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:28.630
and the wound could finally breathe...

01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:32.092
And even though the sting of betrayal

01:14:32.092 --> 01:14:33.677
had permanently marked him,

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:37.306
He could now sleep easy,

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.057
his mind at peace

01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:41.685
Knowing that Justice had been served.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.332
Perception is a peculiar thing.

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:06.251
What one can clearly discern with the eyes

01:15:06.251 --> 01:15:08.378
might be easily misinterpreted by the heart.

01:15:08.378 --> 01:15:08.837
might be easily misinterpreted by the heart.

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:11.298
We only see what we want to see.

01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:14.468
As William Blake so eloquently put it,

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:17.804
" If the doors of perception were cleansed,

01:15:18.555 --> 01:15:21.099
Everything would appear to man as it is...

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:22.434
Infinite ".

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:24.603
And that's exactly what the future held.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.313
Each day,

01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:28.065
A blank page...

01:15:28.732 --> 01:15:31.485
ready and waiting to be written.
