(CHIRPING)

01:01.144 --> 01:02.604
AGNES: Once upon a time,

01:02.688 --> 01:06.567
there was a magical place
called the Motherland,

01:07.651 --> 01:10.279
where Fairy Godmothers lived and learned

01:10.362 --> 01:13.156
all they needed to know
about godmothering.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.908
Oh, blah, blah, blah.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.160
We all know how this bit goes.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.371
This is not your usual fairy tale.

01:19.705 --> 01:22.708
Fairy tales end with "happily ever after,"

01:22.958 --> 01:24.835
and that's where we begin.

01:25.335 --> 01:29.256
AGNES: Good morning, Motherland!

01:30.132 --> 01:33.844
It's almost the weekend,
and you know what that means.

01:34.386 --> 01:40.017
Grab a pumpkin, raise your wands,
break out the glass slippers,

01:40.100 --> 01:43.812
it's time to party like it's 1699.

01:43.896 --> 01:47.774
I'm gonna kick things off
with everyone's favorite pop hit.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.070
(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)

01:54.615 --> 01:59.286
I'm Agnes. I'm 172 years old at least.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.747
And I'm too cool for school.

02:02.080 --> 02:06.835
It's why they made me the resident DJ,
and I don't have to go to lessons.

02:08.337 --> 02:10.255
But this isn't about me.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.549
This is the story of Eleanor.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.178
She's the Motherland's youngest trainee

02:16.261 --> 02:20.182
and the only person
who's bothered to apply in decades.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.685
All she wanted was to graduate,

02:23.769 --> 02:25.771
to be a real Fairy Godmother,

02:25.854 --> 02:29.274
to have her name in a book
alongside the greats.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.903
That's her in the pink, without any pals.

-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

02:36.740 --> 02:38.408
-Uh-oh, here comes trouble.
-(DOOR OPENING)

02:39.117 --> 02:42.079
This is Moira, the headmistress.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.832
She wrote the book
on Fairy Godmothering, literally.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.418
Let us open our texts, shall we?

02:49.628 --> 02:54.174
AGNES: She's been banging on
about the same old formula for centuries.

02:54.258 --> 02:56.844
Yesterday, we reviewed step one.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.096
AGNES: Oh, you didn't know
there was a formula?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.556
Recite it with me, please.

03:01.181 --> 03:05.853
ALL: A glittery gown
turns a frown upside down.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.947
Ooh! Oh, wow!

03:18.615 --> 03:20.826
-Ooh!
-It's just the same.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.955
Once you've conjured the gown,
you're on your way to step two.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.750
-Which is?
-ALL: Find their true love.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.377
Correct.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.589
Now, once the gown and true love
are in place,

03:34.256 --> 03:36.383
we move on to step three.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.843
Which is?

03:37.926 --> 03:39.553
-ELEANOR: Oh, please?
-Anyone?

03:39.678 --> 03:42.014
-Anybody?
-Oh, I know it.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.807
-You?
-My arm's tired.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.392
-MOIRA: Anyone else?
-Hurts to hold it up.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.476
Literally anyone.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.896
-Oh. Oh, please?
-Yes.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.940
-Happily ever after.
-Correct.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.192
(GIGGLES)

03:53.275 --> 03:56.528
Really? Again with the formula?

03:57.196 --> 03:59.823
-Can we do something different today?
-(GASPS)

03:59.907 --> 04:04.161
(HESITATES) No.
Because we never really do anything.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.079
(ALL CHUCKLE)

04:06.163 --> 04:07.539
Enough!

04:08.123 --> 04:09.166
Enough!

04:09.249 --> 04:11.752
AGNES: And this is where
the problems really started,

04:11.835 --> 04:15.422
because Moira is not
someone you want to cross.

04:15.506 --> 04:19.843
Step three is happily ever after.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.555
-It just happens.
-Yes, it just happens.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.557
It's step three.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.310
If you're confused,
I can be your study buddy.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.355
I'm totally available,
like, anytime, day or night.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.191
MOIRA: There's no reason to be confused.

04:34.274 --> 04:39.988
The formula has been the cornerstone
of Fairy Godmothering since it began

04:40.072 --> 04:42.824
because it works.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.535
If it works,

04:44.952 --> 04:47.371
then why is everything around here
falling apart?

04:47.454 --> 04:48.455
(ALL GASP)

04:48.705 --> 04:52.876
Everyone knows that people have
stopped believing in happily ever after.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.881
Well, everyone except Eleanor, that is.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.843
And she's never gonna be
a Fairy Godmother.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.594
Well, you said so yourself.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.099
When's the last time
anyone went on assignment?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.934
(ALL MURMURING)

05:10.519 --> 05:13.730
No more assignments
mean no more Fairy Godmothers.

05:13.814 --> 05:18.193
So when exactly were you going to
fess up to her and us

05:18.277 --> 05:20.863
that you are about to
shut this school down,

05:20.946 --> 05:24.074
and we are all being retrained
as Tooth Fairies?

05:24.157 --> 05:25.158
(GASPS)

05:25.242 --> 05:27.619
(GASPS) What?

05:27.703 --> 05:30.289
AGNES: And this was the moment
that Eleanor realized

05:30.372 --> 05:35.043
she would never be a Fairy Godmother
unless she found an assignment.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.549
Now, being a Tooth Fairy
didn't sound so bad to me.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.009
You only work nights,

05:42.092 --> 05:44.678
you've always got
a little change in your pocket.

05:45.304 --> 05:49.433
But Eleanor, she was
not about to give up her dream.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.728
All she needed was one assignment.

05:53.645 --> 05:56.940
And about 40 to 50 years more training.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.484
ELEANOR: Whoa! Ouch!

06:00.527 --> 06:03.322
(GRUNTS) Ow. Oof!

06:03.906 --> 06:05.824
There has to be something in here.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.994

06:09.912 --> 06:11.663
Nothing. Nothing.

she thought all was lost...

06:25.260 --> 06:26.261

but there is also a boy in my class,

that he would even notice me.

What? No, I'm not going anywhere.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.787
If I was going somewhere,
I'd be packing away my books. Like this.

No. I don't think so.

I just don't know why.

-Can you keep a secret?
-I am a secret.

That's why they're shutting us down.

people still need Fairy Godmothers.

does need a Fairy Godmother,

08:25.422 --> 08:26.882
you're not trained.

08:26.965 --> 08:30.135
Well, I'm not going to get trained
if the Motherland is shut down.

08:30.219 --> 08:34.598

I know that I can do this.

there are worse things
than being a Tooth Fairy.

Moira's not a big fan
of fairies going rogue.

08:58.997 --> 09:03.544
If she finds out you're gone,
she could close the portals back,

15:24.383 --> 15:26.844
So then I said,
"I don't want to be a Tooth Fairy."

15:26.927 --> 15:30.848
Yep. I lost my heart to a Tooth Fairy
one night at Burning Man in 2004.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.266
They're no good.

15:33.016 --> 15:36.478
Well, you should be able to find
a Mackenzie Walsh in there.

15:36.562 --> 15:39.523
-Oh, thank you for everything.
-Oh. (CHUCKLES)

15:43.235 --> 15:45.112
Hey, take this.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.196
Thank you.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.199
Are you sure I can't
make you a ball gown before I go?

15:49.283 --> 15:51.785
Nah. I got a few in the back.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.120
Oh, thank goodness.

15:53.829 --> 15:54.830

16:08.844 --> 16:10.554
What would you do if you found out

16:10.637 --> 16:13.682
your parents weren't actually
your parents at all?

16:13.765 --> 16:18.145
That's the dilemma faced by two men,
both born in the Massachusetts area.

16:18.228 --> 16:21.064
The babies were switched at birth
and reunited with their families

16:21.148 --> 16:22.524
20 years later,

16:22.608 --> 16:26.195
only to discover that the hospital
had it right the first time.

16:26.278 --> 16:30.157
But our top story tonight
is out of Essex County,

16:30.240 --> 16:33.619
where residents
were left shocked and confused.

16:33.702 --> 16:37.080
Look at this barbaric sight.

16:37.623 --> 16:40.751
-Now, police have no motives...
-(GASPS)

16:40.834 --> 16:43.003
...for the destruction
of the pumpkin patch,

16:43.086 --> 16:46.048
but believe local pranksters
may be to blame.

16:46.131 --> 16:49.426
If only these inflatable scarecrows
could talk.

16:49.510 --> 16:50.886
Back to you, Barb.

16:50.969 --> 16:54.723
Thanks, Hugh, for that explosive update.

17:18.747 --> 17:22.000
Looking for a sad little girl
named Mackenzie Walsh.

17:22.084 --> 17:25.712
Awkward haircut,
red, like an angry leprechaun.

17:26.463 --> 17:30.759
Kelly in Brookline has emailed.
She once saw a duck on a ladder.

17:30.843 --> 17:33.053
So deal with that bombshell
how you see fit.

17:33.136 --> 17:34.888
Mack, you have a visitor.

Hey, Murry, can you please move it along?

17:42.688 --> 17:44.523
I promised my kids
I'd cook dinner tonight.

17:44.648 --> 17:48.026
Then I must be looking for your daughter.
Could you tell me how to find her?

Is this someone's idea of a joke?

17:58.370 --> 18:00.914
I'm sorry, I think
there must be some mistake.

18:00.998 --> 18:04.960
I'm looking for the Mackenzie Walsh
that lives at 8566 Hawkins Street.

No, it can't be you. You're...

18:16.305 --> 18:18.307
Old. So old.

18:18.390 --> 18:21.810
This is a disaster.
A woman your age couldn't possibly

18:21.894 --> 18:23.979
still need someone
to make her dreams come true.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.148
Yeah, right,
because I'm clearly living the dream.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.232

18:36.200 --> 18:39.411
Uh, are you from a matchmaking app,
a dating website, what?

18:39.494 --> 18:41.580
Oh, actually, I'm from the Motherland.

a little more original

18:51.298 --> 18:52.674
than the Fairy Godmother act,

18:52.758 --> 18:55.302
and maybe we can get you
a segment for Valentine's Day.

-Over here.

a different shade of spray tan.

No, no, ever since we switched you
to coconut glow,

19:16.073 --> 19:18.158
you are killing it
with teen girls and shut-ins.

that need to step your game up.

19:20.911 --> 19:22.412
Especially you two!

19:22.496 --> 19:23.789
What was that?

19:24.164 --> 19:26.708
"Cops think
pranksters blew up some pumpkins."

19:26.792 --> 19:28.877
That is not getting eyes on the box.

19:28.961 --> 19:35.467
But, "Police rule out witchcraft
in mysterious pumpkin cult massacre"?

19:43.559 --> 19:46.186
Dave forgot to bring us back
from commercial for 12 minutes,

19:46.270 --> 19:47.396
and nobody noticed.

19:48.063 --> 19:51.233
Wrong. Dave got people talking about us.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.569
Is that the summit
of our ambition, really?

19:53.652 --> 19:56.446
Okay. You think you can do better?

19:56.989 --> 20:01.076
Tomorrow, Bruins' playing Golden Knights,
Cold War classic at TD Garden.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.203
Dave, you're my guy,
so you're covering the game.

20:03.287 --> 20:05.956
And I want the two of you on the tailgate.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.584
So tell me, how are you gonna
get people talking about us?

20:08.667 --> 20:11.170
Actually, I was thinking,
instead of covering the tailgate,

20:11.253 --> 20:12.337
we could do a segment

20:12.421 --> 20:15.048
on the team donating coats
to the city's homeless youth.

of everyone cooking in the parking lot,

20:45.454 --> 20:48.582
and we do a whole "Is there salmonella
at the tailgate" kinda thing?

-Yeah. And we'll tell them that at 11:00.

to focus on what's important. Okay?

an igloo or something?

25:43.961 --> 25:46.463
(CHUCKLES) Oh, ice castle construction?

25:46.547 --> 25:48.423

25:53.512 --> 25:55.514
You're putting me in the dungeon?

26:04.439 --> 26:06.483
-Not a dungeon.
-Huh?

26:07.234 --> 26:08.902
MACKENZIE: It's a basement.

26:12.489 --> 26:14.992
-Stay here and be quiet.
-Got it.

26:16.285 --> 26:17.870
Okay. Get me out of this.

26:17.953 --> 26:18.954
Right.

26:19.913 --> 26:20.956
Of course.

26:22.332 --> 26:24.418

26:25.335 --> 26:28.964

quite remember how to poof you back.

26:31.758 --> 26:32.759

Ah, I see everyone is still wide awake

27:41.620 --> 27:43.539
Only thing that would make this better

27:43.622 --> 27:47.417
is if you'd had pizza for dinner
and you hadn't done your homework.

27:47.626 --> 27:50.629
Wow, it's like you've been here
with us this whole time.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.381
Well, the pizza had vegetables on it.

27:52.464 --> 27:54.508

but they were there.

28:02.516 --> 28:04.560
-I failed.
-What?

28:04.643 --> 28:07.604
But I quizzed you on it last night.
You got 100%.

28:07.688 --> 28:11.233
So, you know that I know
the same thing as the people who got an A.

-Ha, ha. Bed. Now.

28:26.999 --> 28:28.000
It was fine.

28:30.878 --> 28:33.463
Mr. Clancy wants her to sing a solo
for show choir.

28:33.547 --> 28:35.424
-Paula.
-Well, it's exciting.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.176
But you're not in show choir.

28:37.259 --> 28:41.096
No, but Kent Buckus is. Only he got mono.

28:41.180 --> 28:44.308
Now, half the choir's out sick,
including Kim Murphy.

28:44.391 --> 28:49.897
So, now Mr. Clancy wants me to
sing Kim's solo at the parade next week.

28:49.980 --> 28:50.981
What parade?

28:51.440 --> 28:53.317
The big holiday parade downtown.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.569
Did you tell him you don't wanna do it?

28:57.529 --> 28:59.656
Yeah, I'm going to. It's a dumb idea.

29:00.699 --> 29:04.161
Uh... Look, it's not a dumb idea.

29:04.244 --> 29:06.538
It's just... They'd be lucky to have you.

29:06.622 --> 29:08.498
There's a reason
you didn't join show choir.

29:08.582 --> 29:10.959

(SIGHS)

29:17.966 --> 29:19.468
I bet when Beyoncé was young,

29:19.551 --> 29:22.221
her mother used to encourage her
in exactly the same way.

29:27.100 --> 29:30.854
Did Beyoncé hyperventilate so badly
in her eighth-grade talent show

29:30.938 --> 29:32.981
that she passed out and cracked a rib?

29:33.065 --> 29:34.525
In seventh grade, it was hives.

29:34.608 --> 29:37.027
She scratched those scabs
so badly they got infected,

29:37.110 --> 29:39.238
I had to take her
to the hospital at 2:00 a.m.

29:39.321 --> 29:41.865
She had a fever of 103.
Doctor said she could have got sepsis.

29:41.949 --> 29:44.076
If you ever get sick of your job
as a TV producer,

29:44.159 --> 29:45.994
you could become a motivational speaker.

29:46.078 --> 29:48.497
Sixth grade, she projectile vomited
before she got onstage.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.291
Every time she goes to perform,
it's a complete disaster.

29:51.375 --> 29:53.168
She ends up totally crushed.

29:53.252 --> 29:54.378
You sound like Mom.

29:54.461 --> 29:56.046
Well, Mom has common sense.

29:56.839 --> 29:58.423
Mom didn't raise Beyoncé.

30:17.150 --> 30:18.235
Oh! (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

30:25.534 --> 30:26.535
What are you doing?

30:27.035 --> 30:28.120
Oh.

30:28.203 --> 30:30.664
-Is this your true love?
-Not anymore.

30:30.998 --> 30:33.000
What? What do you mean?

30:33.083 --> 30:35.752
Step three says
that you find your true love

30:35.836 --> 30:37.462
and you live happily ever after.

30:38.213 --> 30:39.965
Well, we did live happily.

30:41.925 --> 30:43.677
(SIGHS) But life
isn't always a fairy tale.

30:44.178 --> 30:47.764
Sometimes people grow
or change or get divorced

30:47.848 --> 30:50.100
or fall out of love
or run off and join a cult

30:50.184 --> 30:52.811
or fall in love
with a skinny Pilates instructor.

30:53.187 --> 30:55.772
Life isn't as simple
as "happily ever after."

30:56.523 --> 30:57.524
But it has to be.

30:57.608 --> 31:00.652
I came all this way to help you
find your heart's desire.

31:00.736 --> 31:03.113
My heart's desire now
would be a clean house

31:03.197 --> 31:07.326
and maybe the eyebrows that I had
before I started stress plucking.

31:09.203 --> 31:11.371
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

31:13.665 --> 31:14.708
What happened...

31:15.417 --> 31:18.712
What happened to the little girl
that wrote me this letter?

31:20.547 --> 31:21.965
I guess she grew up.

31:22.382 --> 31:24.009
Do you want me to make your bed?

31:25.010 --> 31:26.428
No, I already did it.

31:31.767 --> 31:33.769

Good evening, everyone. I'm Hugh Prince
reporting from the town of Marblehead.

1:00:56.490 --> 1:01:01.787
Now the blizzard means a flurry
of activity, and fun knows snow bounds.

1:01:08.460 --> 1:01:09.461
Oh, no.

for a foot of snow tonight.

-Out of the way!
-But something

1:01:21.014 --> 1:01:23.892
tells me the children of Marblehead
won't be chilling out.

1:01:23.976 --> 1:01:26.812

1:01:50.169 --> 1:01:52.004

1:01:52.087 --> 1:01:54.464

1:01:55.841 --> 1:01:57.759

Okay. Thanks. Talk to you tomorrow.

who takes himself so seriously,

anyone would let all of this get away,

but it happened.

1:03:59.173 --> 1:04:01.925
That's actually how I got
into the whole re-enactment stuff.

1:04:02.009 --> 1:04:04.261
My son, he loves it,
and we do it on our weekends.

1:04:04.386 --> 1:04:07.890

I didn't mean to call you a weirdo.

1:04:07.973 --> 1:04:08.974
It's fine.

1:04:09.057 --> 1:04:11.643
You know, one of the reasons
I wanted to come to Channel 8

1:04:11.727 --> 1:04:13.687
was 'cause I used to
hear about this hotshot

1:04:13.770 --> 1:04:16.398
that was getting her stories picked up
to the national level.

1:04:16.481 --> 1:04:18.942
I mean, I'm surprised
you're not running the joint.

1:04:19.484 --> 1:04:23.530

but it was too soon after...

1:04:24.239 --> 1:04:26.867
Yeah, Duff told me
about your husband. I'm...

1:04:26.950 --> 1:04:28.952
Right, so I needed to focus on my girls,

1:04:29.036 --> 1:04:31.997
and they gave the job to Grant,
and here we are.

1:04:33.081 --> 1:04:34.291
I'm sorry, Mack.

1:04:34.666 --> 1:04:36.752
I'm sorry, too. Grant is an abomination.

-Nothing.

1:12:49.369 --> 1:12:54.333
Something really strange happened to me
on the dance floor... Oh, of course.

1:12:54.416 --> 1:12:55.417
(MUTTERING)

1:12:55.501 --> 1:12:58.045
You had something to do
with this, didn't you?

1:12:58.128 --> 1:13:00.088
(SCREAMING) What the heck?

1:13:02.007 --> 1:13:04.343
Eleanor! Eleanor!

1:13:05.302 --> 1:13:06.470
(MACKENZIE YELPS)

1:13:09.306 --> 1:13:10.307
Oh, wow!

1:13:11.099 --> 1:13:12.142
(GASPS)

1:13:13.018 --> 1:13:14.770
Nice dress. Is it new?

1:13:14.853 --> 1:13:16.897
What have you done to me?

1:13:16.980 --> 1:13:20.651
-Don't be mad. I'm just trying to help.
-Really? Like this?

1:13:20.734 --> 1:13:22.319
You look absolutely beautiful...

1:13:24.780 --> 1:13:29.326
-(LAUGHING) What happened to you?
-Hi, Barb, I just... (HESITATES)

1:13:30.077 --> 1:13:33.413
I ripped my dress, so I borrowed this
from the wardrobe department.

1:13:33.497 --> 1:13:35.332
-It's hilarious.
-Yeah.

1:13:35.415 --> 1:13:38.669
You know, my kid has a costume
just like that at home. (SNICKERS)

1:13:39.962 --> 1:13:41.129
Treat it as a costume.

1:13:41.213 --> 1:13:42.214
(MACKENZIE GROWLS)

1:13:42.297 --> 1:13:45.133
Don't be mad. Don't be mad! Mackenzie!

1:13:46.718 --> 1:13:49.096
Mackenzie! Where are you going?

1:13:49.179 --> 1:13:52.641
Home. Before anybody else sees me.

1:13:52.724 --> 1:13:56.103
What? No! Look at you!

1:13:56.186 --> 1:13:57.604
You look like a princess.

1:13:57.688 --> 1:14:00.107
ELEANOR: (OVER SPEAKERS)
And you're at a ball. Sort of.

1:14:00.190 --> 1:14:02.317
And Duff
and all the other peasants are here.

1:14:02.401 --> 1:14:06.238
And you even waltzed with
the most handsome of all the princes.

1:14:06.321 --> 1:14:09.283
-Hugh Prince!
-Oh, I knew it was you.

1:14:09.366 --> 1:14:12.369
And you said it at the hotel.
You think he's charming.

1:14:12.452 --> 1:14:13.996
And now he's noticing you.

1:14:14.079 --> 1:14:17.082
Isn't that what you wanted
since you were ten years old?

1:14:17.165 --> 1:14:22.004
So, why fight true love when you can
just kiss and live happily ever after?

1:14:22.087 --> 1:14:23.088
Because...

1:14:26.383 --> 1:14:27.384
(CHUCKLES)

1:14:27.926 --> 1:14:32.139
-(HESITATES) Happily ever after?
-Yes!

1:14:32.556 --> 1:14:34.766
You're her prince.
Now, let's get this done.

1:14:34.850 --> 1:14:38.187
-No! Eleanor, this isn't what I want.
-I... Why are you...

1:14:38.854 --> 1:14:41.064
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You're that...

1:14:42.024 --> 1:14:44.526
-You're flying saucer chick.
-Yes. That's me.

1:14:44.610 --> 1:14:45.611
Hey.

1:14:45.694 --> 1:14:48.030
Oh, Mackenzie and Hugh
said we were a big hit.

1:14:48.530 --> 1:14:49.865
Is that so?

1:14:49.948 --> 1:14:52.576
Oh, yes, they were so worried
about getting fired.

1:14:52.659 --> 1:14:56.538
But I guess all you need
for job security is a viral video.

1:14:56.622 --> 1:14:58.290
(ALL GASPING)

1:14:58.957 --> 1:15:02.169
-No, it's not like that.
-That is not exactly what...

1:15:02.252 --> 1:15:07.549
9:00 a.m., my office, tomorrow morning.
We can talk about job security then. Mmm?

1:15:16.183 --> 1:15:20.812
Mackenzie! Mackenzie, I'm sorry.
Please just talk to me.

1:15:20.896 --> 1:15:23.941
Why should I talk to you?
You don't listen to anything I say.

1:15:24.024 --> 1:15:25.776
-That's not true.
-It is.

1:15:25.859 --> 1:15:28.487
You came here and did exactly
what you promised you wouldn't do.

1:15:28.570 --> 1:15:31.114
And the worst part is,
you didn't even need to.

1:15:31.198 --> 1:15:34.868
I was actually having fun tonight.
I felt pretty.

1:15:34.952 --> 1:15:36.495
But why isn't that enough for you?

1:15:36.995 --> 1:15:41.166
Why am I a failure
unless I'm dressed like ginger Elvis?

1:15:41.250 --> 1:15:44.628
-You're not a failure.
-Then why are you here?

1:15:44.711 --> 1:15:48.549
Because I don't wanna fail!
They're closing down the Motherland.

1:15:49.007 --> 1:15:51.885
So, you're my only chance
at being a Fairy Godmother.

1:15:52.636 --> 1:15:55.556
And if I don't get you
to "happily ever after,"

1:15:55.639 --> 1:15:59.852
then I'll have to spend
the rest of my life as a Tooth Fairy.

1:15:59.935 --> 1:16:04.398
-(SCOFFS) This is all about you.
-No! Of course not. I...

1:16:05.649 --> 1:16:07.150
Wait. Is it?

1:16:07.568 --> 1:16:11.321
All this time, I thought you cared
about wanting to make me happy.

1:16:11.405 --> 1:16:12.823
You just want it for you.

1:16:12.906 --> 1:16:15.409
You don't care what I want,
not if it gets in your way.

1:16:16.285 --> 1:16:18.537
I'm so sorry, Mackenzie.

1:16:18.620 --> 1:16:21.498
I'm sorry too, Eleanor,
but you need to leave.

1:16:29.715 --> 1:16:30.716
Mackenzie!

1:16:32.843 --> 1:16:36.513
ELEANOR: She was right about everything.
I'm not Fairy Godmother material.

1:16:36.597 --> 1:16:40.350
And "happily ever afters,"
those are just for fairy tales.

1:16:40.434 --> 1:16:41.768
But you helped us.

1:16:43.770 --> 1:16:46.607
-MIA: Don't go.
-I'm sorry. It's over.

1:16:46.690 --> 1:16:48.901
-She'll calm down.
-But we need you.

1:16:49.318 --> 1:16:50.402
I have to go.

1:16:51.695 --> 1:16:52.905
Goodbye, girls.

1:17:05.501 --> 1:17:06.627
Bye, Bingo.

1:17:08.337 --> 1:17:09.546
Bingo?

1:17:12.216 --> 1:17:13.717
Who's that pig?

1:17:18.889 --> 1:17:20.349
Now we have a pig and a dog.

1:17:23.393 --> 1:17:25.938
Eleanor, where are you?
(SHUDDERS)

1:17:35.197 --> 1:17:38.534
Gourds? Pumpkins? Carriages?

1:17:38.617 --> 1:17:40.160
Transport.

1:17:41.620 --> 1:17:42.621
(GASPS)

1:17:52.798 --> 1:17:53.799
(SIGHS)

1:18:04.434 --> 1:18:05.602
Hi.

1:18:05.686 --> 1:18:08.230
-I need to tell you something.
-I just wanna...

1:18:08.313 --> 1:18:09.314
Yes.

1:18:09.523 --> 1:18:12.276
I really wanted to apologize
about last night.

1:18:12.359 --> 1:18:13.944
I'm just completely mortified.

1:18:14.027 --> 1:18:18.448
I think I had too much punch or something,
and things got a little wild.

1:18:18.532 --> 1:18:21.368
No, it's... I mean, yeah,
I was surprised, but...

1:18:22.578 --> 1:18:23.787
But not in a bad way.

1:18:24.454 --> 1:18:25.789
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1:18:26.915 --> 1:18:31.044
Hey! You two!
What are you doin'? Get in here!

1:18:32.337 --> 1:18:34.631
(GROANING) My tum-tum.

1:18:35.382 --> 1:18:39.261
I'm gonna be straight with you guys.
I hit the eggnog way too hard last night.

1:18:39.344 --> 1:18:42.681
So, I'm gonna keep this quick.
Did you fake the flying saucer story?

1:18:43.182 --> 1:18:45.559
-No! We would never fake a story.
-Absolutely not.

1:18:45.642 --> 1:18:48.270
Really? Then how do you explain this?

1:18:49.938 --> 1:18:50.939
Huh?

1:18:52.191 --> 1:18:56.153
And why is flying saucer girl
at the Bruins game?

1:18:56.695 --> 1:19:00.449
'Cause she's my cousin,
and she's visiting from Canada.

1:19:00.532 --> 1:19:02.868
You seriously want me to believe
that you and your cousin

1:19:02.951 --> 1:19:05.412
had nothing to do with the fireballs?

1:19:05.913 --> 1:19:06.997
It was an accident.

1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:09.791
Ah! So was the blackout too, I suppose.

1:19:10.209 --> 1:19:11.418
That's her, isn't it?

1:19:12.252 --> 1:19:15.672
We had three big news stories this week,

1:19:15.756 --> 1:19:19.968
and your cousin was there
for every single one of them. Yes or no?

1:19:20.052 --> 1:19:21.720
Mack, what's goin' on?

1:19:21.803 --> 1:19:23.347
I just... I can't.

1:19:23.430 --> 1:19:27.392
It's really hard to explain.
But I did not fake a story.

1:19:28.519 --> 1:19:32.981
Yeah. You lack the initiative
to pull that off. I actually believe you.

1:19:33.065 --> 1:19:35.567
Plus, your cousin seems crazy.
She is, right?

1:19:35.651 --> 1:19:39.404
No! No, she's just a little different.

1:19:39.488 --> 1:19:44.660
She's a chaos machine.
And you should be ashamed of yourself...

1:19:48.872 --> 1:19:50.749
For not cutting me in sooner.

1:19:50.832 --> 1:19:53.418
You're good. She is ratings gold.

1:19:53.502 --> 1:19:55.838
Here's what we'll do.
We're gonna put a camera on her,

1:19:55.921 --> 1:19:59.550
and we are gonna let her fly
her freak flag until we're number one.

1:19:59.633 --> 1:20:02.010
-That's exploitation. No.
-But that's not news.

1:20:02.094 --> 1:20:04.304
I know. It's gonna be awesome.

1:20:06.723 --> 1:20:07.766
No!

1:20:07.850 --> 1:20:10.894
I won't let you
take somebody kind and good

1:20:10.978 --> 1:20:12.646
and turn them into a sideshow.

1:20:12.729 --> 1:20:16.316
You're a single mom, and you haven't put
a good story out in I don't know how long,

1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:19.069
so "no" isn't really an option for you.

1:20:19.152 --> 1:20:21.613
You do what I say, or you're fired.

1:20:25.284 --> 1:20:28.328
-I am done doing things your way.
-Mack, I'm not sure you...

1:20:28.412 --> 1:20:30.330
You're the reason we're in last place.

1:20:30.414 --> 1:20:32.416
Ah! Fourth place.

1:20:32.499 --> 1:20:34.751
You want us to spin things
and twist things

1:20:34.835 --> 1:20:37.546
and tell stories about bad people
doing bad things,

1:20:37.629 --> 1:20:39.715
but people want more than fearmongering.

1:20:39.798 --> 1:20:41.133
They wanna...

1:20:41.216 --> 1:20:45.762
To laugh, and to hope, and be inspired
to see the magic in the world.

1:20:45.846 --> 1:20:47.973
-'Cause it's real.
-That's cute.

1:20:48.599 --> 1:20:49.683
You're fired.

1:20:49.766 --> 1:20:51.268
Yeah. No kidding.

1:20:52.561 --> 1:20:54.688
You deserve so much better
than this place.

1:20:54.771 --> 1:20:57.065
I know. That's what I was tryin'
to tell you before.

1:20:57.149 --> 1:20:59.109
I took the job at Channel 4, so...

1:20:59.776 --> 1:21:02.154
(INHALES) Merry Christmas. I quit.

1:21:03.864 --> 1:21:05.199
How's that for spectacle?

1:21:16.502 --> 1:21:18.504
-Bye.

Uh...

1:22:20.274 --> 1:22:24.403
Mr. Clancy called. Honey, you're supposed
to be on stage for the rehearsal.

1:22:30.951 --> 1:22:32.452
Is that Dad's guitar?

1:22:34.746 --> 1:22:38.667
(CRYING) You were right. You were right.

1:22:40.169 --> 1:22:43.088
I can't do this. I can't do anything.

1:22:43.630 --> 1:22:45.215
Oh, I never said that.

1:22:45.299 --> 1:22:47.593
Yeah, well, you never said that I could.

1:22:49.303 --> 1:22:52.472
Or that you thought that I'd be amazing.

1:22:54.224 --> 1:22:57.019
But Eleanor did.

1:22:59.062 --> 1:23:04.318
And now she's gone.
And I can't do this. I can't...

1:23:11.742 --> 1:23:13.493
I'm so sorry.

1:23:17.331 --> 1:23:22.085
Honey, if you need Eleanor,
I'll find her. I promise.

1:23:26.340 --> 1:23:28.926
Should we bring Dad's guitar with us
for good luck?

1:23:32.304 --> 1:23:34.598
Gary, we need you!

1:23:34.681 --> 1:23:37.100
-JANE: He's not here!
-Where's Eleanor?

1:23:37.184 --> 1:23:40.729
Gary, I'll leave the lids
off the trash cans if you just come out!

1:23:41.104 --> 1:23:42.898

-(CHITTERS)
-MACKENZIE: (SCREAMING) Gary!

1:23:45.734 --> 1:23:49.571
I'm not sure he can actually
understand human. But look!

1:23:49.655 --> 1:23:52.032
I think Aunt Paula's
been looking for Eleanor.

1:24:23.146 --> 1:24:24.147
-Ooh!
-PAULA: Ah.

1:24:26.358 --> 1:24:27.693
It's hopeless.

1:24:27.776 --> 1:24:32.030
PAULA: Are you sure a pumpkin carriage
is the fastest way back to the Motherland?

1:24:32.114 --> 1:24:33.198
Yes, but...

1:24:33.282 --> 1:24:36.118
-I'm never going to get it.
-No worries.

1:24:37.327 --> 1:24:39.037
That was our last pumpkin.

1:24:40.789 --> 1:24:42.082
I've got an idea.

1:24:46.753 --> 1:24:47.754
Ta-da!

1:24:48.088 --> 1:24:49.506
That's not a pumpkin.

1:24:51.341 --> 1:24:53.760
-No. I know it's not a pumpkin.
-Good.

1:24:53.844 --> 1:24:57.264
-Okay. You know what? Loosen up, right?
-All right.

1:24:57.347 --> 1:25:00.559
You know, just really stay loose
and don't think about the fact

1:25:00.642 --> 1:25:02.436
that that's a watermelon,
not a pumpkin,

1:25:02.519 --> 1:25:05.147
and you might not have
enough magic left to get home,

1:25:05.230 --> 1:25:06.773
and you might be stuck here forever.

1:25:08.442 --> 1:25:10.777
I'm sorry, that wasn't
a very good pep talk.

1:25:10.861 --> 1:25:12.863

Why aren't you at the parade?

Why can't we see that?

1:39:37.186 --> 1:39:39.855
Eleanor didn't magically fix my life.

1:39:39.938 --> 1:39:42.149
She showed me how to fix it myself.

1:39:44.902 --> 1:39:46.361
That's how we can help them.

1:39:51.450 --> 1:39:53.035
This is a day I thought I'd never see.

1:40:01.210 --> 1:40:03.837
You did well!

1:40:03.921 --> 1:40:05.923
-(CROWD CHEERING)
-Oh! I did well!

1:40:09.635 --> 1:40:13.138
-Maybe it's time to re-write the book.
-All right.

1:40:13.222 --> 1:40:16.016
Now, let's go home
and save some Fairy Godmothers.

1:40:17.476 --> 1:40:19.394
Thank you for everything.

1:40:21.063 --> 1:40:22.439
Thank you.

1:40:24.149 --> 1:40:26.735
-Go be a Godmother.
-All right.

1:40:40.415 --> 1:40:41.416
Bye!

1:40:48.841 --> 1:40:51.301
MOIRA: Wands up!

1:40:53.929 --> 1:40:55.722

MACKENZIE: Gary!

1:41:29.047 --> 1:41:33.010
AGNES: Wait! We're not done yet.

1:41:34.845 --> 1:41:37.806
Good morning, Motherland!

1:41:38.307 --> 1:41:41.518
No, I don't think I'm shouting.
Hold, please.

1:41:42.144 --> 1:41:45.898
Why don't we kick things off
with something a bit more groovy today?

1:41:46.481 --> 1:41:47.482
Take it away.

1:41:49.234 --> 1:41:54.114
Now, I told you this wasn't a fairy tale,
but that was only half true.

1:41:54.615 --> 1:41:57.409
In the end, Eleanor got hers all right.

1:41:57.492 --> 1:42:00.871
Only it wasn't anything like
she'd read in those books.

1:42:00.954 --> 1:42:03.165
And that was a good thing.

1:42:03.248 --> 1:42:06.210
We weren't just old.
We'd become old-fashioned.

1:42:06.835 --> 1:42:09.713
There are those who might say...
(CLEARS THROAT)

1:42:09.880 --> 1:42:12.883
I had spent my whole life
believing in fairy tales.

1:42:13.425 --> 1:42:16.428
Well, now I believe in them
more than ever.

1:42:17.304 --> 1:42:20.057
It's just that they come
in all different shapes and sizes.

1:42:20.265 --> 1:42:24.144
Just like us. And thanks to
our newly patented approach

1:42:24.228 --> 1:42:27.773
of, "Forget ever after,
just live happily," we've been busy.

1:42:27.856 --> 1:42:32.486
AGNES: Eleanor! Wand up, kid.
We've still got a lotta work to do.

1:42:32.986 --> 1:42:35.239
