WEBVTT

00:02.033 --> 00:03.667
He was coming to dinner on Sunday.

00:03.668 --> 00:06.503
It's only because my
customers requested it.

00:06.504 --> 00:08.277
Everyone has a choice, Ernst.

00:08.278 --> 00:10.405
I want to leave, Albert, please.

00:10.406 --> 00:11.823
We're not going anywhere, Elsa.

00:11.824 --> 00:12.984
There's already much discussion

00:12.985 --> 00:14.145
of a Nobel.

00:14.146 --> 00:15.371
Relativity is a hoax.

00:15.372 --> 00:18.016
It isn't grounded in
any concrete discovery.

00:18.017 --> 00:19.757
You want to pay me for a divorce?

00:19.758 --> 00:21.079
Mileva Maric

00:21.080 --> 00:23.175
is to retain full custody in Zurich.

00:23.176 --> 00:25.110
You idolized your father, Eduard,

00:25.111 --> 00:27.046
but he was never there and I could see

00:27.047 --> 00:28.884
how painful that was for you.

00:28.885 --> 00:30.045
Tell Papa I want to see him.

00:30.046 --> 00:31.818
Albert Einstein has engaged

00:31.819 --> 00:33.752
in a profit-grubbing promotion

00:33.753 --> 00:37.332
as our country suffers
deprivation and indignity.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.138
Einstein obviously
desires a public battle.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.880
It's time I enlisted some public allies.

00:40.881 --> 00:43.426
Stay down!

00:43.427 --> 00:45.426
Elsa, you're right; it's time.

00:47.039 --> 00:49.748
Hello... It's the United States embassy.

00:49.749 --> 00:51.779
I am conducting this
inquiry at the request

00:51.780 --> 00:53.618
- of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover.
- Hoover.

00:53.619 --> 00:55.622
What does he want with me?

Osip, go wash before your brothers wake.

Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

Get the kid.

Everybody up! Against the wall!

01:58.067 --> 01:59.679
- Mama.
- What, what is this?

01:59.680 --> 02:01.903
- What have we done?
- Shut your mouth, kike.

02:01.904 --> 02:03.257
Mama!

02:03.258 --> 02:04.258
Stop resisting!

02:04.259 --> 02:05.450
Please, please.

02:05.451 --> 02:06.611
He didn't do anything.

02:06.612 --> 02:08.545
Please, please.

02:08.547 --> 02:11.771
Almost 3000 subversives
taken into custody,

02:11.772 --> 02:15.126
from 33 cities in 23 different states.

02:15.127 --> 02:18.221
Well done, Mr. Hoover.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.931
The majority were known anarchists, sir,

02:20.932 --> 02:24.704
but we arrested a number
of socialists as well.

02:24.705 --> 02:26.993
We sent a strong message to
these immigrants that threats

02:26.994 --> 02:29.218
to the American way of
life will not be tolerated.

02:29.219 --> 02:31.184
Interrogations are in progress.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.345
Deportations will begin imminently.

02:33.346 --> 02:34.732
And these reports of abuse?

02:34.733 --> 02:37.216
The only publications giving them any ink

02:37.217 --> 02:40.923
are communist rags. Heh.

02:40.924 --> 02:44.149
You got a bright future
ahead of you, Edgar.

02:44.150 --> 02:45.599
Thank you, sir.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.405
I'm conducting this inquiry

02:47.406 --> 02:49.050
at the request of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover,

02:49.051 --> 02:51.792
director of the United States
Bureau of Investigation.

02:51.793 --> 02:53.758
- Hoover?
- Yes.

02:53.759 --> 02:55.532
Mr. J. Edgar Hoover.

02:55.533 --> 02:57.531
What does he want with me?

02:57.532 --> 02:59.886
He's been quite interested
in your political activities

02:59.887 --> 03:02.594
and affiliations since your
first visit to New York.

03:02.595 --> 03:04.625
So if you do not answer my questions

03:04.626 --> 03:06.464
to his satisfaction,

03:06.465 --> 03:09.462
you will not be granted entry
to the United States of America.

03:09.463 --> 03:11.011
I don't have to put up with this.

03:11.012 --> 03:12.366
Albert, sit down.

03:12.367 --> 03:13.527
No. I will not.

03:13.528 --> 03:14.849
The land of the free,

03:14.850 --> 03:16.396
isn't that what you call it?

03:16.397 --> 03:18.010
I've devoted my life
to freedom of thought,

03:18.011 --> 03:19.363
to peace for all peoples.

03:19.364 --> 03:21.169
And your American director of espionage

03:21.170 --> 03:23.492
is concerned about my affiliations?

03:23.493 --> 03:25.974
I meant no offense. I'm
not here to accuse you

03:25.975 --> 03:27.619
of anything, sir, I'm merely here

03:27.620 --> 03:29.458
- to ask questions.
- Really?

03:29.459 --> 03:31.425
Or are you desperate for
the next rung on the ladder?

03:31.426 --> 03:33.649
- Albert, please.
- Flattered to be asked

03:33.650 --> 03:35.035
to interrogate the
famous Dr. Albert Einstein

03:35.036 --> 03:37.122
with visions of promotion in your head?

03:37.123 --> 03:38.257
Albert!

03:51.571 --> 03:55.155
Please excuse my husband's
outburst, Mr. Geist.

03:57.054 --> 03:59.374
Uh, let's return to the subject

03:59.375 --> 04:01.470
of your former wife, Mileva Maric.

04:01.471 --> 04:03.921
When did you last speak?

04:03.922 --> 04:05.598
Thursday, I think.

04:05.599 --> 04:06.985
And what did you discuss?

04:06.986 --> 04:10.177
We discussed our son, Eduard.

04:10.178 --> 04:11.982
He's not been well.

04:11.983 --> 04:13.338
I'm sorry to hear that.

04:13.339 --> 04:15.272
Are you acquainted

04:15.273 --> 04:16.531
with Miss Maric's brother?

04:16.531 --> 04:18.819
I met him 20 years ago.

04:18.820 --> 04:20.529
I've not seen him since.

04:20.529 --> 04:21.884
Are you aware he now resides

04:21.885 --> 04:23.721
in the Soviet Union?

04:23.722 --> 04:25.978
She might have mentioned it.

04:25.979 --> 04:30.043
And to your knowledge, has
she ever visited him there?

04:30.044 --> 04:32.655
She has not... to my knowledge.

04:32.656 --> 04:35.074
Let's move on, shall we?

04:35.075 --> 04:37.975
How did you come to know Chaim Weizmann?

04:37.976 --> 04:39.232
Oh, I see.

04:39.233 --> 04:40.909
This is a one-way street

04:40.910 --> 04:42.361
we are driving down, is it?

04:42.362 --> 04:44.071
The Weizmanns are old friends of ours.

04:44.072 --> 04:45.876
Excuse me, Mrs. Einstein.

04:45.877 --> 04:47.913
The question was for your husband.

04:49.683 --> 04:52.715
How did you come to know Chaim Weizmann?

04:52.914 --> 04:54.164
It's all right, Chaim,

04:54.165 --> 04:56.390
you can admit you don't understand.

04:56.391 --> 04:58.615
Albert, you have been
explaining general relativity

04:58.616 --> 05:01.969
for more than three hours,
and I am fully convinced

05:01.970 --> 05:04.162
that you understand it.

05:04.163 --> 05:06.644
I anticipated

05:06.645 --> 05:08.999
that many would struggle
to comprehend my theory,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.481
but I must admit, I've
been a little taken aback

05:11.482 --> 05:14.771
by the jeers and the snubs,

05:14.772 --> 05:16.706
particularly from the Nobel committee.

05:16.707 --> 05:20.188
There will always be resistance
to revolutionary ideas.

05:20.189 --> 05:22.930
But we've proved it with
mathematics, with astronomy.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.575
Some people see a beautiful proof,

05:24.576 --> 05:26.348
others a damning repudiation.

05:26.349 --> 05:28.574
That's why certain scientists loathe you,

05:28.575 --> 05:32.959
while the rest of the world
has fallen hopelessly in love.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.635
It's unpleasant sensation to be beloved,

05:34.636 --> 05:36.377
not for your ideas,

05:36.378 --> 05:37.699
but for the image people have of you.

05:37.700 --> 05:40.441
Of course, your fame also
affords us an opportunity.

05:40.442 --> 05:42.763
Chaim, if this is an
attempt to recruit me

05:42.764 --> 05:44.762
to the Zionist cause, you
should save your breath.

05:44.763 --> 05:46.084
- Albert...
- No.

05:46.085 --> 05:48.502
We have just barely made it through

05:48.503 --> 05:50.695
the death and destruction of the war.

05:50.696 --> 05:53.812
You cannot ask me to support
the creation of a new nation

05:53.813 --> 05:56.296
that will inevitably
bring us to war again.

05:56.297 --> 05:58.714
The world's Jews are in
desperate need of a refuge.

05:58.715 --> 05:59.779
But is Palestine the answer?

05:59.780 --> 06:01.101
It is not uninhabited land.

06:01.102 --> 06:03.262
You should visit with me someday.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.261
You'll find our Arab
friends living in harmony

06:05.262 --> 06:06.969
with our Jewish brothers and sisters.

06:06.970 --> 06:09.130
The Arab people will rise up to resist

06:09.131 --> 06:11.421
such in influx of newcomers.

06:11.422 --> 06:15.096
It's not a matter of "if", but "when."

06:15.097 --> 06:17.452
Will you join me upstairs?

06:17.453 --> 06:20.874
There's something I'd like to show you.

06:23.708 --> 06:26.060
Kill the Jews.

06:26.061 --> 06:29.930
That was their battle cry... 1903.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.414
The day after the
Russian Orthodox Easter.

06:32.415 --> 06:35.025
They celebrated resurrection

06:35.026 --> 06:37.868
then brutally murdered
hundreds of our people.

06:39.638 --> 06:43.410
This was but one of many pogroms.

06:43.411 --> 06:45.410
Ukraine, Poland,

06:45.411 --> 06:47.215
even Argentina.

06:47.216 --> 06:50.150
Babies ripped from mothers' arms.

06:50.151 --> 06:52.343
Slaughtered.

06:52.344 --> 06:54.343
My God.

06:54.344 --> 06:56.859
So, of course, they fled.

06:56.860 --> 06:59.503
As our ancestors did from Egypt.

06:59.504 --> 07:02.567
To Berlin, to London, to Chicago,

07:02.568 --> 07:05.405
Minneapolis, New York.

07:05.406 --> 07:08.693
And what did they find when they arrived?

07:08.694 --> 07:10.467
Squalor, pestilence.

07:10.468 --> 07:13.368
Blamed for the ills of the nations

07:13.369 --> 07:15.498
in which they sought refuge.

07:15.499 --> 07:18.626
Last year, the attorney
general of the United States

07:18.627 --> 07:22.591
ordered raids that rounded
up thousands of Jews,

07:22.592 --> 07:25.451
accusing them of
anarchism and radicalism.

07:25.452 --> 07:28.289
An excuse to deport them.

07:28.290 --> 07:29.965
When I tell you that

07:29.966 --> 07:32.643
our people are desperate for
a home, it is not harsh words

07:32.644 --> 07:35.030
from jealous colleagues they are fleeing.

07:35.031 --> 07:38.835
Nor a snub from the Nobel committee.

07:38.836 --> 07:43.258
It is endless death and destruction.

07:44.608 --> 07:47.477
There are dozens of
nations hospitable to Arabs.

07:47.478 --> 07:49.837
But our tribesmen?

07:54.218 --> 07:59.421
They have nowhere to go.

07:59.422 --> 08:01.743
I sail for the United States next week

08:01.744 --> 08:04.682
to raise money for a Hebrew
university in Palestine.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.618
Come with me.

08:13.507 --> 08:15.658
I should never have let
you go to dinner with Chaim.

08:15.659 --> 08:16.771
I knew this would happen.

08:16.772 --> 08:19.906
You are providing ammunition
to those fools who believe

08:19.907 --> 08:21.680
that Jews cannot be good Germans.

08:21.681 --> 08:23.551
I've never aspired to be a good German.

08:23.552 --> 08:24.969
Well, this does not concern only you.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.581
No, it doesn't.

08:26.582 --> 08:28.839
It concerns legions of our
people who are suffering.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.549
And you're going to rescue them
all with Chaim's university,

08:30.550 --> 08:31.550
are you?

08:31.551 --> 08:34.577
Elsa, I know you are
not this cold-hearted.

08:36.193 --> 08:38.611
And what about Brussels,
the Solvay Conference?

08:38.611 --> 08:40.875
You're the only German scientist invited,

08:40.876 --> 08:43.335
- and you're simply going to cancel?
- Four years of carnage.

08:43.336 --> 08:45.250
Now I should be the one
who is supposed to heal

08:45.251 --> 08:46.443
all the wounds of the war?

08:46.444 --> 08:48.250
And Eduard,

08:48.251 --> 08:50.055
you're going to miss his piano recital.

08:50.056 --> 08:51.764
I'll take him sailing this summer.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.479
He'll understand.

08:54.669 --> 08:59.988
To you, this is a chance to do good.

08:59.989 --> 09:02.407
To the rest of the world,
it is... it's a famous man

09:02.408 --> 09:03.891
putting his race above his country.

09:03.892 --> 09:05.728
And your enemies will use it against you.

09:05.729 --> 09:09.119
How the world sees me,
it's not important to me.

09:10.373 --> 09:11.985
I wonder if you'll feel the same way

09:11.986 --> 09:14.016
should the world turn against you.

09:25.239 --> 09:26.818
Dr. Einstein, how long will you stay...

09:34.656 --> 09:36.041
- Sir!
- Professor!

09:36.042 --> 09:39.201
He can't answer if he can't hear!

09:39.202 --> 09:40.813
Uh, you, sir.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.750
Professor Einstein, can you
explain the theory of relativity

09:43.751 --> 09:45.232
in one sentence?

09:45.233 --> 09:47.619
All of my life I've tried
to put it into one book

09:47.620 --> 09:50.360
and this fellow wants
it in a single sentence.

09:55.618 --> 09:56.905
- You, there.
- Will you be giving any lectures

09:56.906 --> 09:58.390
- while you're here?
- Yes.

09:58.391 --> 10:00.873
We have many scheduled,
but I am here primarily

10:00.874 --> 10:03.455
- to support a Jewish university...
- Dr. Einstein

10:03.456 --> 10:04.872
will lecture at Princeton,

10:04.873 --> 10:06.163
and then visit Harvard.

10:06.164 --> 10:07.679
Do you believe Zionism does more

10:07.680 --> 10:08.763
harm than good?

10:08.764 --> 10:11.098
No. That is foolish thinking.

10:11.099 --> 10:12.837
Well, then what do you
say to those who believe

10:12.838 --> 10:14.806
Jews should assimilate
into American society?

10:14.807 --> 10:16.837
I say it is a Jewish weakness,

10:16.838 --> 10:19.706
trying always to keep the
gentiles in good humor.

10:19.707 --> 10:21.739
Dr. Einstein is here to raise funds

10:21.740 --> 10:23.576
for a university.

10:23.577 --> 10:25.221
Education is a boon to all.

10:25.222 --> 10:26.962
Thank you very much.

10:38.143 --> 10:39.315
I don't appreciate

10:39.316 --> 10:41.905
anyone doing my talking for me!

10:41.906 --> 10:44.176
Tell her, Chaim. You
brought me here to speak out,

10:44.177 --> 10:46.896
not to trot in front of the
press like some circus animal.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.231
Chaim brought you here
to advance the cause.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.597
Insulting American Jews is
not an effective approach.

10:51.598 --> 10:53.550
Elsa's right.

10:53.551 --> 10:55.423
As I told you, most of
them are assimilationists,

10:55.424 --> 10:56.780
especially the wealthy ones.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.499
So we shouldn't attempt
to change their minds?

10:59.500 --> 11:01.546
- By calling them weak?
- I was asked the question!

11:01.547 --> 11:02.824
And I told you how to answer it.

11:02.825 --> 11:04.137
"Education is a boon to all"

11:04.138 --> 11:05.736
is not an answer.

11:05.737 --> 11:07.432
You and I are in agreement, Albert.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.829
We should not have to give
up any part of ourselves

11:09.830 --> 11:12.133
in order to be treated as equals.

11:12.134 --> 11:13.861
But we need their money.

11:13.862 --> 11:15.843
I took the liberty of
writing some remarks

11:15.844 --> 11:17.448
for you for tomorrow.

11:22.530 --> 11:24.383
Tell me, Dr. Lenard,

11:24.384 --> 11:28.733
why should we deny Einstein
the Nobel this year?

11:28.734 --> 11:30.781
My case remains the same.

11:30.782 --> 11:33.693
Theoretical physics is
the purview of con artists.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.923
They are like... Cubist painters...

11:36.924 --> 11:38.938
...unable to render form decently,

11:38.939 --> 11:41.593
convincing the world their
scrawlings are high art.

11:41.594 --> 11:44.791
I quite like the little Spanish chap.

11:47.959 --> 11:50.197
There is no science

11:50.198 --> 11:53.045
but that which can be
explored experimentally.

11:53.046 --> 11:58.065
Albert Einstein, unpalatable to
you though he may be, Philipp,

11:58.066 --> 12:01.200
is the most famous
scientist in the world.

12:01.201 --> 12:05.359
To deny him the Nobel again... well,

12:05.360 --> 12:09.485
some might say we are
beginning to look like fools.

12:16.043 --> 12:18.154
Thank you very much.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.496
Thank you. Thank you so much.

12:19.497 --> 12:21.064
God bless you, Einstein.

12:21.065 --> 12:23.565
Thank you very much.

12:24.455 --> 12:25.478
Dr. Einstein!

12:25.479 --> 12:26.501
Thank you.

12:26.502 --> 12:29.796
Dr. Einstein! Dr. Einstein!

12:29.797 --> 12:31.427
Hey, kid! Where do
you think you're going?

12:31.428 --> 12:32.835
Dr. Einstein!

12:32.836 --> 12:34.339
Where the hell do you
think you're going, huh?

12:34.340 --> 12:35.394
- Dr. Einstein!
- You bastard!

12:35.395 --> 12:37.736
Please, sir, let him go.

12:39.905 --> 12:42.148
Are you all right, young man?

12:46.047 --> 12:49.251
To build a home for the Jews.

12:58.616 --> 13:00.183
I cannot take it.

13:00.184 --> 13:04.828
They took my father away.
They said he was dangerous.

13:06.774 --> 13:07.893
Please.

13:07.894 --> 13:10.041
I want him to have home.

13:13.555 --> 13:16.368
What is your name?

13:16.369 --> 13:18.069
Osip.

13:18.961 --> 13:21.327
Thank you, Osip.

13:21.328 --> 13:23.700
I promise I'll make good use of it.

13:28.205 --> 13:30.186
Thank you for coming.

13:30.187 --> 13:32.587
As a young Jewish man

13:32.588 --> 13:36.527
with dreams of discovering the
mysteries of the universe...

13:37.993 --> 13:39.560
...I was lucky

13:39.561 --> 13:42.219
to have many inspiring professors.

13:44.070 --> 13:45.636
Well, the truth is,

13:45.637 --> 13:47.715
most of my professors
thought I would not grow up

13:47.716 --> 13:49.923
to accomplish much of anything.

14:01.471 --> 14:05.149
I have not been the best of Jews.

14:05.150 --> 14:09.435
Before today, I had not set
foot in a synagogue in years.

14:09.436 --> 14:12.377
But now, I've come to believe

14:12.378 --> 14:14.969
a university that celebrates our heritage

14:14.970 --> 14:18.429
is essential to the future of our youth.

14:20.311 --> 14:23.572
Today, I am here with you to
celebrate our Jewish heritage

14:23.573 --> 14:25.561
as special and of value.

14:26.452 --> 14:28.626
Unique.

14:29.779 --> 14:31.121
Some people think it is dangerous,

14:31.122 --> 14:33.488
defining ourselves as different.

14:33.489 --> 14:36.848
Blend in, they say. Do not stand out.

14:36.849 --> 14:40.079
Do not ask questions of authority.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.693
To me, they sound suspiciously
like my stuffy old professors.

14:46.284 --> 14:49.098
We deserve to be accepted.

14:49.099 --> 14:52.136
Our heritage, our faith,

14:52.137 --> 14:54.536
our traditions and history.

14:54.537 --> 14:58.054
Why must we assimilate?

14:58.055 --> 15:00.773
There is no justice in that.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.717
Only loss.

15:03.718 --> 15:05.667
Our people

15:05.668 --> 15:07.784
have sacrificed enough.

15:45.107 --> 15:46.888
So the trip wasn't a success?

15:46.889 --> 15:48.734
People were not as
generous as we had hoped.

15:48.735 --> 15:50.579
That's not true, Elsa.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.844
There was that little boy,
Osip, who gave me a nickel.

15:53.730 --> 15:55.797
And the poor woman in the Bronx

15:55.798 --> 15:58.757
who dropped her wedding
ring in the donation box.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.285
Who knows?

16:00.286 --> 16:02.830
Maybe one day, we'll bump into her again

16:02.831 --> 16:04.834
and we can buy her a new one.

16:04.835 --> 16:07.922
My husband's optimism is one of his

16:07.923 --> 16:09.290
most admirable qualities.

16:09.291 --> 16:10.848
Right, then.

16:10.849 --> 16:13.330
Um...

16:13.331 --> 16:15.304
were you aware of any
persons at these rallies

16:15.305 --> 16:16.767
who held subversive beliefs?

16:16.768 --> 16:18.326
Well, I was there.

16:18.327 --> 16:19.535
- Oh, Albert.
- And what subversive beliefs

16:19.536 --> 16:21.412
do you hold, Dr. Einstein?

16:21.413 --> 16:23.354
Well, they're mostly
established facts now.

16:23.355 --> 16:25.518
Things like the existence of molecules,

16:25.519 --> 16:27.013
the notion that gravity bends light,

16:27.014 --> 16:28.349
- tiny...
- Sir,

16:28.350 --> 16:29.685
I was referring to
your political beliefs,

16:29.686 --> 16:31.404
not your scientific ideas.

16:31.405 --> 16:32.422
But I think you knew that.

16:32.423 --> 16:33.791
You do?

16:33.792 --> 16:35.127
Because you chose two words

16:35.128 --> 16:37.036
which can mean many things.

16:37.037 --> 16:40.282
Communists, socialists, anarchists.

16:40.283 --> 16:41.746
Were you aware of their presence at...

16:41.747 --> 16:43.566
I didn't take a survey at the door.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.550
If you're going to
accuse me of something,

16:46.551 --> 16:50.527
Mr. Geist, please,
let's get to the point.

16:50.528 --> 16:52.213
Very well.

16:52.214 --> 16:54.823
Dr. Einstein, the
United States government

16:54.824 --> 16:56.096
has reason to believe that you are

16:56.097 --> 16:57.656
a member of the Communist Party.

16:57.657 --> 16:59.826
Oh.

17:06.566 --> 17:08.664
"Albert Einstein advises, advocates,

17:08.665 --> 17:10.192
"or teaches individual resistance

17:10.193 --> 17:11.655
"to all accepted authorities...

17:11.656 --> 17:13.565
"whether it be a
question of peace or war,

17:13.566 --> 17:14.837
"government or religion,

17:14.838 --> 17:18.083
mathematics or anthrology..."

17:18.084 --> 17:19.833
She must have meant anthropology.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.201
May I see that,

17:21.202 --> 17:22.385
please?

17:28.267 --> 17:31.167
The Women's Patriot Corporation.

17:33.326 --> 17:36.824
You mean to tell me that
we are being interrogated

17:36.825 --> 17:39.943
because a gaggle of honking
geese wrote a letter?

17:39.944 --> 17:40.961
The Women's Patriot Corporation...

17:40.962 --> 17:42.331
Frothingham?

17:42.332 --> 17:45.893
Frothingham, that can't
possibly be a person's name.

17:45.894 --> 17:47.929
Mrs. Frothingham and her compatriots

17:47.930 --> 17:50.634
are concerned American citizens.

17:50.635 --> 17:52.066
Director Hoover feels their findings

17:52.067 --> 17:53.626
are worthy of being taken seriously.

17:53.627 --> 17:55.217
Well, these geese are
right about one thing:

17:55.218 --> 17:56.681
I do have a contempt for authority.

17:56.682 --> 17:57.986
Oh, it's true.

17:57.987 --> 18:00.404
The surest way to get my
husband to do what you want is to

18:00.405 --> 18:01.739
- tell him not to.
- Dr. Einstein...

18:01.740 --> 18:03.396
Mrs. Frothingham

18:03.397 --> 18:06.417
suggests here that relativity is
of no more practical importance

18:06.418 --> 18:07.850
than the number of angels

18:07.851 --> 18:10.554
dancing on the head of a pin.

18:10.555 --> 18:11.923
How many angels do you,

18:11.924 --> 18:13.195
or Mrs. Frothingham,

18:13.196 --> 18:15.104
imagine could fit

18:15.105 --> 18:16.950
on the head of a pin...

18:16.951 --> 18:19.598
...and still have room to dance?

18:21.470 --> 18:22.899
I suggest you treat me

18:22.900 --> 18:25.033
and these proceedings with some respect.

18:25.034 --> 18:26.241
You're not making it

18:26.242 --> 18:28.188
easy for me.

18:30.920 --> 18:34.578
Well, let's get back to the
matter at hand, shall we?

18:34.579 --> 18:37.727
Are you in fact a member
of the Communist Party?

18:40.433 --> 18:42.533
Well, Mr. Geist,

18:42.534 --> 18:46.128
despite my deepest sympathy
for certain socialist ideals...

18:46.129 --> 18:47.083
Such as?

18:47.084 --> 18:48.388
Economic fairness,

18:48.389 --> 18:50.170
the belief that it is our duty as humans

18:50.171 --> 18:51.729
to contribute to our communities.

18:51.730 --> 18:54.147
But the notion that I should
join the Communist Party...

18:54.148 --> 18:57.297
a commitment that would
require I surrender my autonomy

18:57.298 --> 18:58.539
to the authority of the state...

18:58.540 --> 19:00.862
that, good sir, is a nonsense.

19:00.863 --> 19:04.137
A monkey in a hat riding
a dog to a donut factory.

19:06.526 --> 19:10.534
Well, I'm concerned that
neither of you are...

19:10.535 --> 19:13.333
appreciating the gravity
of this situation.

19:13.334 --> 19:15.467
I dare say I know a
bit more about gravity

19:15.468 --> 19:16.771
than you, Mr. Geist,

19:16.772 --> 19:19.412
and a few other things besides.

19:19.413 --> 19:21.646
How long have you lived in Berlin?

19:23.104 --> 19:24.472
A little over two years.

19:24.473 --> 19:26.922
What do you think about Mr. Hitler?

19:26.923 --> 19:28.958
Oh, he's unpleasant.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.359
But in the grand scheme of things,

19:30.360 --> 19:31.726
he seems little more than a nuisance.

19:31.727 --> 19:34.432
I don't understand you, Mr. Geist.

19:34.433 --> 19:35.991
Hitler rejects economic rule

19:35.992 --> 19:38.790
and talks of expanding German territory.

19:38.791 --> 19:41.400
He advocates for eugenics.

19:41.401 --> 19:44.619
Who are the impure ones
he speaks of, do you think?

19:46.460 --> 19:48.432
I would like to leave
Germany of my own accord

19:48.433 --> 19:51.931
and save him the trouble
of violently exiling me.

19:51.932 --> 19:53.586
Or worse.

19:53.587 --> 19:56.291
Do you really think the German
people would stand for that?

19:56.292 --> 19:59.091
The government deporting the
world's most famous scientist?

19:59.092 --> 20:02.368
Jewish scientist. I'm a Jew.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.040
Zionism, communism...

20:05.041 --> 20:06.409
these are not the threats

20:06.410 --> 20:07.968
that should be concerning you, Mr. Geist.

20:07.969 --> 20:11.029
It's fascism that should
have you trembling.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.173
Dr. Einstein, we're getting off...

20:14.174 --> 20:15.605
Tell me,

20:15.606 --> 20:18.343
have you heard of Walther Rathenau?

20:18.344 --> 20:21.811
You know, it's five years

20:21.812 --> 20:23.121
since I've looked at this.

20:24.006 --> 20:25.916
And I...

20:25.917 --> 20:27.665
I hardly remember writing it.

20:27.666 --> 20:31.769
"That which produces harmony
in the chorus of the universe

20:31.770 --> 20:35.111
can seem a discord to
our partial hearing."

20:35.112 --> 20:36.383
These words, they're beautiful.

20:36.384 --> 20:38.006
Thank you.

20:38.007 --> 20:40.552
So, how can you write about
freedom for the human spirit,

20:40.553 --> 20:42.683
and yet still be opposed to Zionism?

20:42.684 --> 20:46.120
If I wanted to hear someone call me

20:46.121 --> 20:47.871
a traitor to the Jews,

20:47.872 --> 20:50.894
I would have invited
your friend, Weizmann.

20:50.895 --> 20:52.039
I still don't understand why

20:52.040 --> 20:53.088
you won't speak out for us.

20:53.089 --> 20:56.049
Even if I agreed with your cause,

20:56.050 --> 20:57.544
Albert,

20:57.545 --> 20:59.802
do you really think

20:59.803 --> 21:02.221
that my speaking out
would make it any better?

21:02.222 --> 21:03.653
You are the most powerful Jew

21:03.654 --> 21:06.518
in Germany; your voice
would make a difference.

21:06.519 --> 21:08.235
The Gentiles respect you.

21:08.236 --> 21:09.794
Yeah, and how long

21:09.795 --> 21:11.004
do you think that respect will last

21:11.005 --> 21:12.657
if I put my religion above my nation?

21:12.658 --> 21:14.472
- Oh...
- Already, the radicals

21:14.473 --> 21:15.745
are blaming me

21:15.746 --> 21:18.003
for Germany's paying war reparations.

21:18.004 --> 21:19.244
I am foreign minister

21:19.245 --> 21:20.937
in a difficult time.

21:26.978 --> 21:28.702
Thank you for this.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.427
Are you still coming
for dinner on Sunday?

21:36.428 --> 21:39.068
If Elsa is making the roast.

21:39.069 --> 21:40.856
She will.

21:44.797 --> 21:47.030
You'll never be one of them.

21:50.875 --> 21:54.055
Walther was a German patriot.

21:54.056 --> 21:56.187
Still, they slaughtered
him like an animal.

21:56.188 --> 21:59.179
Minister Rathenau was
assassinated a decade ago.

21:59.180 --> 22:02.328
Yes, it has been ten years.

22:02.329 --> 22:04.428
And since then, your
stock market has crashed,

22:04.429 --> 22:05.797
people are out of work,

22:05.798 --> 22:07.643
starving.

22:07.644 --> 22:11.620
Hitler promises jobs, bread,
pride to desperate people.

22:11.621 --> 22:15.062
Why is it so hard to believe
they might follow him?

22:17.093 --> 22:20.815
Mrs. Einstein, would
you please excuse us?

22:20.816 --> 22:23.520
No, I think not.

22:23.521 --> 22:25.270
My wife and I have no secrets.

22:25.271 --> 22:27.115
Well, I'm afraid I cannot
continue the interview

22:27.116 --> 22:29.699
with Mrs. Einstein in the room.

22:38.191 --> 22:40.321
Why don't you go home

22:40.322 --> 22:42.733
and finish the packing.

23:07.442 --> 23:09.913
Please...

23:09.914 --> 23:11.678
tell me about Betty Neumann.

23:11.679 --> 23:14.213
She worked for me. She no longer does.

23:14.214 --> 23:15.721
Mm.

23:15.722 --> 23:18.994
I have a very efficient
woman handling my affairs now.

23:18.995 --> 23:21.818
Miss Dukas.

23:21.819 --> 23:23.391
Perhaps not as attractive

23:23.392 --> 23:25.189
as Miss Neumann,

23:25.190 --> 23:26.890
- but I need a good secretary...
- Secretary?

23:26.891 --> 23:29.489
Was that the full extent of your
relationship with Miss Neumann?

23:29.490 --> 23:31.549
You mean was I intimate with her?

23:33.117 --> 23:35.079
Sexually?

23:37.032 --> 23:41.717
I was. But what does that
got to do with anything?

23:41.718 --> 23:45.985
Men who have been indiscrete
are vulnerable to blackmail.

23:45.986 --> 23:48.360
A communist operative
could pressure you...

23:48.361 --> 23:51.474
No one is going to
pressure me about Betty.

23:51.475 --> 23:54.458
You better start walking.

23:54.459 --> 23:56.576
Are you throwing me out?

23:56.577 --> 23:58.021
The opera?

23:58.022 --> 24:00.268
You've been looking
forward to it all week.

24:00.269 --> 24:01.614
You'll miss the curtain.

24:01.615 --> 24:03.604
I'm only going if I can wear a disguise.

24:03.605 --> 24:05.916
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I have to.

24:05.917 --> 24:07.713
Because I'm either Dr. Albert Einstein,

24:07.714 --> 24:10.344
or I'm that dirty Jew who broke physics.

24:10.345 --> 24:11.724
I've been those things for so long,

24:11.725 --> 24:14.458
I'm beginning to forget
who I started out to be.

24:16.187 --> 24:18.112
Have you seen this?

24:18.113 --> 24:21.898
Lenard's latest, condemning
general relativity

24:21.899 --> 24:24.050
as wild speculation,

24:24.051 --> 24:25.686
propped up by the Jewish press,

24:25.687 --> 24:28.028
signed by 19 physicists.

24:28.029 --> 24:29.473
Good ones?

24:29.474 --> 24:32.302
- No.
- Well, then...

24:49.982 --> 24:51.425
My dear, I thought you

24:51.426 --> 24:53.575
would have gone on to
the opera without me.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.597
Sit.

24:55.598 --> 24:59.224
I'm sorry. I was delayed.

24:59.225 --> 25:00.893
I should have called.

25:00.894 --> 25:02.824
Or asked Betty to do so.

25:05.643 --> 25:09.430
Maybe she was otherwise engaged.

25:09.431 --> 25:12.452
Between your thighs perhaps?

25:14.213 --> 25:18.127
This is nothing, with
Betty. A momentary escape.

25:18.128 --> 25:20.245
Some pleasure to numb

25:20.246 --> 25:23.295
the world's constant pull upon me.

25:23.296 --> 25:25.797
It has nothing to do with our life.

25:25.798 --> 25:27.915
You are a selfish man.

25:27.916 --> 25:31.253
You have convinced yourself that
your contributions to the world

25:31.254 --> 25:33.564
absolve you from the
responsibility you bear

25:33.565 --> 25:36.453
to those you claim to love.

25:36.454 --> 25:38.217
They do not.

25:38.218 --> 25:39.952
I've never said that.

25:39.953 --> 25:43.673
Your actions speak for
you. You don't listen.

25:43.674 --> 25:44.765
I do.

25:44.766 --> 25:48.167
I don't feel safe, Albert.

25:48.168 --> 25:51.280
And I have told you
this over and over again.

25:51.281 --> 25:53.430
And still, you fan the flames with Chaim,

25:53.431 --> 25:55.067
insisting that we stay here.

25:55.068 --> 25:56.446
For what, pride?

25:56.447 --> 25:58.758
The cause is important,
so is my work here.

25:58.759 --> 26:01.421
Your sons haven't seen you in months.

26:01.422 --> 26:03.957
Yes, well, things have been...

26:03.958 --> 26:06.305
Things are always.

26:11.596 --> 26:15.414
I love this life,

26:15.415 --> 26:18.078
but I will not be treated
as an afterthought in it.

26:18.079 --> 26:21.962
So I will make a bargain with you.

26:21.963 --> 26:25.557
You may engage in as many
dalliances as you like,

26:25.558 --> 26:29.087
but when you have made
a commitment to me,

26:29.088 --> 26:31.268
I come first.

26:31.269 --> 26:34.671
And to prove it to me, you
will take me away from here,

26:34.672 --> 26:39.163
at least for a month or two, and soon.

26:39.164 --> 26:42.508
This is not negotiable.

26:53.801 --> 26:55.987
Elsa.

26:57.652 --> 26:59.094
You made me.

26:59.095 --> 27:00.955
I was a lump of clay,

27:00.956 --> 27:02.754
and you shaped me.

27:02.755 --> 27:06.353
I'm not sure I'd still be
alive if you hadn't taken me in.

27:08.178 --> 27:11.874
I should never have treated
you with such disregard.

27:14.790 --> 27:17.933
From the bottom of my heart,

27:17.934 --> 27:21.085
I'm sorry.

27:25.733 --> 27:27.850
Elsa knows everything,

27:27.851 --> 27:30.384
so there's no threat
of blackmail, Mr. Geist.

27:30.385 --> 27:32.663
- I see.
- There's so much about the world

27:32.664 --> 27:36.129
Elsa has always understood
more keenly than I.

27:36.130 --> 27:38.023
The shifts and moods of the culture,

27:38.024 --> 27:41.558
she sees such things the
way I see calculations.

27:43.673 --> 27:46.720
If it were me and me
alone I had to worry about,

27:46.721 --> 27:50.219
I probably would have
lived a more reckless life.

27:50.220 --> 27:53.428
I owe Elsa a great deal,

27:53.429 --> 27:56.510
so I did as she asked.

27:56.511 --> 28:00.329
I gave my attention to
science, lectures, conferences.

28:00.330 --> 28:03.250
I accepted the offer to go to Japan.

28:03.251 --> 28:05.849
We sailed far from Germany.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.968
I cannot deny the skill involved,

28:07.969 --> 28:09.668
but it's a little too erratic for me,

28:09.669 --> 28:11.625
this modern music.

28:11.626 --> 28:13.807
Thank you.

28:13.808 --> 28:16.407
♪ ♪

28:16.408 --> 28:17.856
Thank you.

28:22.186 --> 28:25.522
Albert.

28:25.523 --> 28:26.742
They've done it.

28:26.743 --> 28:28.507
They've given you the Nobel Prize!

28:28.508 --> 28:31.620
So they've finally run out of excuses?

28:31.621 --> 28:34.188
If we disembark at the next port,

28:34.189 --> 28:36.370
we can make it to Sweden
in time for the ceremony.

28:36.371 --> 28:38.038
Ah.

28:38.039 --> 28:41.248
Let them present the
medal to an empty chair.

28:41.249 --> 28:43.688
I know you detest the committee, but...

28:43.689 --> 28:45.998
They refuse to acknowledge relativity.

28:45.999 --> 28:47.282
- What?
- But they cannot ignore me,

28:47.283 --> 28:48.726
so I'm being given the prize

28:48.727 --> 28:51.262
for my paper on the photoelectric effect.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.380
- Really?
- My dearest Elsa,

28:53.381 --> 28:55.465
I know care not one whit about physics,

28:55.466 --> 28:56.557
but let me remind you,

28:56.558 --> 28:58.772
this paper would not have existed

28:58.773 --> 29:01.082
without the work of Philipp Lenard.

29:01.083 --> 29:03.906
Oh, my.

29:03.907 --> 29:05.773
He's going to lose his mind.

29:07.566 --> 29:10.197
Welcome to the Nazi Party, Dr. Lenard.

29:10.198 --> 29:12.220
We are honored to have you in our ranks.

29:12.221 --> 29:14.087
The honor is entirely mine.

29:16.263 --> 29:17.706
I'd hoped when we returned home

29:17.707 --> 29:19.793
that the mood would have cooled,

29:19.794 --> 29:22.105
and I could have continued
my work with Chaim,

29:22.106 --> 29:24.253
but Elsa wouldn't have it.

29:24.254 --> 29:28.523
So the great Albert Einstein
bends to authority after all?

29:30.353 --> 29:32.572
Who knew you had a sense
of humor, Mr. Geist?

29:34.140 --> 29:37.188
If my wife had her way, we would
never have returned to Germany.

29:37.189 --> 29:40.398
And sitting here today,
I rather wish we hadn't.

29:40.399 --> 29:42.099
Why did you?

29:42.100 --> 29:45.147
I like my study, with
all my things just so.

29:45.148 --> 29:49.645
My tobacco shop, where Ernst
always has my favorite blend.

29:51.759 --> 29:53.978
I was settled.

29:55.418 --> 29:59.237
I'm not quite sure how
all of that happened.

29:59.238 --> 30:02.226
A settled man is never
what I set out to be.

30:07.774 --> 30:10.501
So...

30:10.502 --> 30:13.037
your contention is that you gave up

30:13.038 --> 30:14.641
your political activities entirely,

30:14.642 --> 30:17.240
and devoted yourself
only to your science?

30:17.241 --> 30:19.327
Mm.

30:19.328 --> 30:21.574
Ernst, my good man.

30:21.575 --> 30:25.232
Ah, two tins of the usual, Professor?

30:25.233 --> 30:27.542
Indeed. And I would like
you to meet my good friend

30:27.543 --> 30:30.464
and thorn in my scientific
side, Dr. Niels Bohr.

30:30.465 --> 30:31.586
Hello.

30:31.587 --> 30:33.320
An honor to meet you, sir.

30:33.321 --> 30:34.860
Ernst, are you familiar with

30:34.861 --> 30:37.204
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?

30:37.205 --> 30:38.782
I can't say

30:38.783 --> 30:39.966
that I am, Professor.

30:39.967 --> 30:41.983
Well, it states that the
more accurately we measure

30:41.984 --> 30:43.813
the velocity of a particle,

30:43.814 --> 30:48.022
the less accurately we can
measure its position in space.

30:49.495 --> 30:53.472
So you know exactly how
fast a thing is going...

30:53.473 --> 30:57.549
Yes, but if we do, we cannot
also know where that thing is.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.281
Does that sound logical to you?

30:59.282 --> 31:00.822
- No, sir.
- Of course not.

31:00.823 --> 31:02.845
And according to my esteemed colleague,

31:02.846 --> 31:06.150
the particle does not exist
at all until we observe it.

31:06.151 --> 31:08.878
That makes absolutely no sense to me.

31:08.879 --> 31:10.226
Exactly!

31:10.227 --> 31:12.189
Thank you, Ernst.

31:13.115 --> 31:15.457
Shall we stop by your butcher's as well?

31:15.458 --> 31:17.350
Perhaps he has an opinion on the matter.

31:17.351 --> 31:19.919
Ha, ha, ha, very amusing.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.806
Albert, the uncertainty
principle works, it functions.

31:22.807 --> 31:25.887
And it allows us to make
use of the quantum world.

31:25.888 --> 31:28.263
The goal of scientific
pursuit should not be merely

31:28.264 --> 31:30.381
to make use of the world around us,

31:30.382 --> 31:33.495
it should be to understand
it, fundamentally.

31:33.496 --> 31:35.162
No matter what use it might be.

31:35.163 --> 31:37.190
Albert, Albert, watch out!

31:40.203 --> 31:43.668
Just watch where you're going, please.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.941
Why should I? Why should either of us?

31:46.942 --> 31:49.477
According to you, if that
automobile was a particle,

31:49.478 --> 31:51.531
but we didn't see it,

31:51.532 --> 31:53.457
it wouldn't have been there at all.

31:54.934 --> 31:57.822
We would be perfectly safe.

31:57.823 --> 32:02.058
Automobiles aren't
subatomic particles, Albert.

32:02.059 --> 32:03.726
Niels, it defies common sense

32:03.727 --> 32:06.327
that the rules which govern
those things we can see

32:06.328 --> 32:10.439
do not apply to those we cannot.

32:11.264 --> 32:13.254
I will not turn off
my brain simply because

32:13.255 --> 32:15.180
you've decided the matter is settled.

32:15.181 --> 32:17.555
Well, if you don't start using
your brain to observe what's

32:17.556 --> 32:20.121
right in front of you, you're
going to get yourself killed.

32:20.122 --> 32:22.004
Hmm.

32:22.005 --> 32:24.618
Did you read his speech? From Nuremburg?

32:24.619 --> 32:26.373
Yeah, he's an egomaniacal swindler.

32:26.374 --> 32:28.191
No one takes him seriously.

32:28.192 --> 32:30.155
I'm beginning to wonder
if perhaps we should.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.179
Well, I didn't come
here to discuss politics.

32:32.180 --> 32:34.506
Of course not. Oh...

32:34.507 --> 32:36.260
I've been thinking.

32:36.261 --> 32:39.099
What if we imagined a box full of light,

32:39.100 --> 32:41.364
and we placed a precise number of protons

32:41.365 --> 32:43.054
inside the box.

32:43.055 --> 32:46.115
We weigh a single one
of them, and let it out.

32:46.116 --> 32:47.679
What happens?

32:47.680 --> 32:49.082
Sorry. One more time.

32:49.083 --> 32:51.411
These particles, smaller than we can see,

32:51.412 --> 32:52.847
even with a microscope,

32:52.848 --> 32:55.813
are measurable only as... probabilities,

32:55.814 --> 32:57.152
where they might exist in space?

32:57.153 --> 32:58.523
How fast they might be going?

32:58.524 --> 32:59.741
Very good.

33:00.820 --> 33:02.669
So it's a game of chance, then?

33:02.670 --> 33:03.850
A mathematical guess?

33:03.851 --> 33:05.412
According to Bohr.

33:05.413 --> 33:08.634
But I do not believe God
plays dice with the universe.

33:08.635 --> 33:11.893
You know, in all this
talk of your being a Jew,

33:11.894 --> 33:13.582
this is the first time
you've mentioned God.

33:13.583 --> 33:15.105
That's another one of those words

33:15.106 --> 33:16.859
that can mean many different things.

33:16.860 --> 33:18.933
- But you do believe in God?
- If I say no,

33:18.934 --> 33:21.517
will it prove I'm a communist?

33:22.666 --> 33:24.259
What I believe...

33:24.260 --> 33:28.789
is the universe is so extraordinary,

33:28.790 --> 33:31.856
only God could have created it.

33:33.893 --> 33:37.082
My job is simply to
figure out how He did it.

33:39.155 --> 33:41.738
What about you, Mr. Geist?

33:41.739 --> 33:43.881
Are you a religious man?

33:44.768 --> 33:46.682
I was raised Methodist.

33:46.683 --> 33:48.092
Are you still?

33:49.458 --> 33:52.773
Well... Mother was the true believer.

33:54.178 --> 33:56.249
Every holiday, she would make extra food,

33:56.250 --> 33:58.865
and she'd pile me and my
brother into the Studebaker

33:58.866 --> 34:00.397
with all the dishes,

34:00.398 --> 34:02.183
and we'd drive across
town to the train station.

34:02.184 --> 34:03.904
That's where all the men
who were out of work went

34:03.905 --> 34:05.149
to get warm.

34:05.150 --> 34:08.848
And we would serve them all plates.

34:08.849 --> 34:11.527
I used to think we must be
the richest family in town

34:11.529 --> 34:14.181
to be able to give up so
much when no one else did.

34:15.610 --> 34:18.257
Your mother sounds
like a wonderful woman.

34:18.259 --> 34:19.668
She was.

34:23.106 --> 34:25.786
I thought about her when you
spoke about the wedding ring

34:25.786 --> 34:28.272
dropped in your donation box.
