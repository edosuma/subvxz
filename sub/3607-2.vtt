WEBVTT

00:18.769 --> 00:20.311
Anything?

00:20.396 --> 00:22.438
You keep asking if there's anything.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.607
Pardon me for appearing desperate,

00:24.692 --> 00:27.402
but before the pilot was ripped
from the cockpit,

00:27.486 --> 00:32.323
he did say that no one's gonna find us
unless we get that transceiver working.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.618
So... is there anything?

00:35.703 --> 00:38.413
- No.
- OK.

00:39.665 --> 00:42.625
What were you doing in the bathroom?

00:43.293 --> 00:46.504
Thought you could tell.
I was getting sick.

00:46.588 --> 00:51.509
Puking. My one tangible
contribution to the trek.

00:51.593 --> 00:55.847
No, I'm glad you came, Charlie.

00:55.931 --> 01:00.017
- Every trek needs a coward.
- You're not a coward.

01:16.744 --> 01:20.747
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm good, thanks.

01:20.831 --> 01:24.542
- Can I get you a water or...?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.380
Please?

01:31.633 --> 01:33.384
All right.

01:59.161 --> 02:02.163
- Excuse me.
- Guess he really had to go.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.248
Sir? Excuse me!

02:05.375 --> 02:07.376
Sir, excuse me.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.388
Excuse me.

02:31.151 --> 02:35.321
Ladies and gentleman, the captain has
turned on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.366
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.423
Sir? Are you all right?

02:55.592 --> 03:05.768
Just a minute.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.187
I'm gonna have to ask
that you open the door.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.617
Open the door now, sir.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.162
Sir?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.593
We're going through some clothes.
Sorting them.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.138
I see you found your bag.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.392
- Come on, you wanna give us a hand?
- Not really.

04:29.019 --> 04:32.521
You're wasting your time.
They're coming.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.360
Is that your boyfriend?

04:42.199 --> 04:45.368
My brother. Boone.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.704
God's friggin' gift to humanity.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.506
I used to have a stomach.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.225
- Do you know what it is?
- Not yet.

05:14.231 --> 05:17.775
I haven't felt the baby move
since yesterday.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.596
Excuse me.

05:51.977 --> 05:55.771
Hey, have you...?
Have you seen my boy?

06:21.590 --> 06:23.174
Sorry.

06:25.260 --> 06:29.138
Walt! Walt!

06:37.064 --> 06:44.487
Vincent!

06:57.709 --> 06:59.710
Come here, boy.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.447
Hey!

07:29.866 --> 07:32.118
What did I tell you
after what's happened?

07:32.202 --> 07:35.246
- I thought Vincent would be around.
- Stay on the beach.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.289
I thought this would be OK.

07:37.374 --> 07:41.210
Don't do that. You listen to me,
I mean what I say. You understand?

07:43.505 --> 07:45.506
- What is this?
- I just found 'em.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.311
Come here.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.485
Hey, guys, come on.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.903
Hey.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.745
Hey! Break it up!

08:16.830 --> 08:19.331
- Break it up! Get off!
- Hey, come on, break it...

08:19.416 --> 08:21.917
- You son of a bitch.
- That's it. It's over.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.003
- Come on.
- That's it!

08:24.546 --> 08:26.922
- I'm sick of this redneck!
- Want some more?

08:27.007 --> 08:30.676
Tell everyone what you told me!
Tell them I made the plane crash.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.804
- The shoe fits.
- What is going on?

08:34.764 --> 08:38.100
- What's going on?
- My kid found these in the jungle.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.854
This guy was in the back row
of business class the whole flight.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.648
Never got up.
Hands folded underneath the blanket.

08:44.733 --> 08:48.152
And for some reason,
just pointing this out,

08:48.236 --> 08:51.405
- the guy next to him didn't make it.
- Thank you for observing.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.617
Don't think I saw them pull you
out of line before we boarded?

08:54.701 --> 08:57.203
- Come on! Bring it!
- Stop!

09:01.625 --> 09:04.877
We found the transceiver,
but it's not working.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.671
Can anybody help?

09:11.092 --> 09:13.969
Yes, I might be able to.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.847
Oh, great! Perfect.
Let's trust this guy.

09:16.932 --> 09:18.724
Hey, we're all in this together.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.602
- Treat each other with respect...
- Shut up, lardo.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.479
Hey!

09:24.314 --> 09:25.981
Give it a break.

09:27.943 --> 09:31.487
Whatever you say, doc,
you're the hero.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.494
You guys found the cockpit?

09:42.332 --> 09:43.666
Any survivors?

09:47.504 --> 09:49.463
No.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.257
It's dual-band. Military spec.

09:51.341 --> 09:55.261
Chances are the battery is good,
but the radio is dead.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.681
- Can you fix it?
- I need some time.

10:00.350 --> 10:05.020
Doctor, that man with the shrapnel,
I think you should take a look at him.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.283
Chain-smoking jackass.

10:18.785 --> 10:24.581
- Some people have problems.
- Some people have problems. Us. Him.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.046
You're OK. I like you.

10:33.425 --> 10:36.093
You're OK too.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.389
Hurley. Oh, just...

10:43.435 --> 10:44.977
Sayid.

10:49.816 --> 10:53.694
- How do you know how to do that?
- I was a communications officer.

10:53.778 --> 10:57.614
- Oh, yeah? You ever see battle?
- I fought in the Gulf War.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.659
No way. I got a buddy
who fought over there.

11:00.744 --> 11:05.706
He was in the 104th Airborne.
What were you, Air Force? Army?

11:05.790 --> 11:07.791
The Republican Guard.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.623
Is it working?

12:29.707 --> 12:32.543
It seems to be,
except we're not picking up a signal.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.336
Aren't we trying to send one?

12:34.421 --> 12:37.005
Yes, but what you want to see here
is little bars.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.174
The bars show
it's getting reception.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.219
- We need the bars?
- We could broadcast blind,

12:42.303 --> 12:46.014
hope that someone, maybe a ship
somewhere picks up our distress call.

12:46.099 --> 12:50.102
But that would be a waste of the
battery, which might not last for long.

12:51.354 --> 12:54.106
- There is one thing we could try.
- What?

12:54.190 --> 12:57.025
- Get the signal from high ground.
- How high?

13:33.730 --> 13:35.731
How is he?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.484
Can you do anything?

13:39.235 --> 13:43.071
- I can pull out the shrapnel.
- But you said if you took it out...

13:43.156 --> 13:47.493
That was yesterday. I was hoping
he'd be at a hospital by now.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.662
If I leave him like this
he'll be dead within a day.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.623
If I open him up...

13:52.707 --> 13:56.251
If I can control the bleeding,
and if he doesn't go into sepsis,

13:56.336 --> 14:00.672
and if I can find some antibiotics,
he might be all right.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.597
I'm going on a hike.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.519
- Sorry?
- Sayid fixed the transceiver,

14:13.603 --> 14:15.854
- but we can't use it, not from here.
- Wait.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.648
You said we had to send a signal.

14:17.732 --> 14:21.235
- You saw what that thing did.
- Yeah, I did.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.948
What makes you think we're any safer
here than we are in the jungle?

14:28.034 --> 14:31.787
- Wait for me. I don't know how long...
- Sayid said the battery won't last.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.418
All right.

14:38.503 --> 14:42.631
If you see or hear anything...
Anything...

14:46.553 --> 14:48.387
Run.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.442
What's up?

15:48.990 --> 15:51.033
What, that?

15:55.747 --> 15:58.081
What, eat that?

16:01.544 --> 16:05.213
Dude, dude, I'm starving.

16:06.049 --> 16:09.051
But I am nowhere near that hungry.

16:09.886 --> 16:13.513
No. No. No, thank you.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.141
No way. No.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.078
The comic's in Spanish. You...

16:36.496 --> 16:40.791
- ...read Spanish?
- No. I found it.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.138
Tell you what, we get home...

16:55.932 --> 16:58.392
...I'll get you another dog.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.540
Hey!

17:21.624 --> 17:23.834
- I need your help.
- OK.

17:23.917 --> 17:28.046
Help me go through the luggage. I need
any prescription medications you find,

17:28.131 --> 17:32.509
especially drugs that end in "mycin"
and "cillin." Those are antibiotics.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.303
What's this for?

18:01.998 --> 18:03.165
What are you doing?

18:07.170 --> 18:09.546
I think I was mean to him.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.298
What?

18:11.382 --> 18:14.426
He's that guy from the gate.

18:15.011 --> 18:20.348
He wouldn't let us have our seats
in first class. He saved our lives.

18:26.355 --> 18:30.859
Shannon, we're trying to clear
the wreckage. You should help out.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.278
You're just being worthless over here.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.489
- Being what?
- What do you want me to say?

18:35.573 --> 18:39.701
- You're sitting staring at bodies.
- I've just been through a trauma.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.497
We all have. The difference
is you've given yourself a pedicure.

18:43.581 --> 18:44.581
You know what?

18:44.665 --> 18:47.876
- It is easy to make fun of me...
- I wish I didn't waste my time.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.086
I wish I didn't have a reason!
It is easy.

18:50.171 --> 18:54.674
Screw you. You do not have
the slightest idea what I am thinking.

18:54.759 --> 18:58.804
- No, you don't!
- OK, Shannon, what are you thinking?

19:08.564 --> 19:11.608
I'm going with them. On the hike.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.735
- Oh, yeah?
- Yup. I'm going.

19:13.820 --> 19:18.615
- No you're not, Shannon. Shannon!
- I'd like to come with you.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.076
- She's not going.
- The hell I'm not!

19:21.160 --> 19:23.203
- This is what she does.
- You don't know!

19:23.287 --> 19:25.664
Makes bad decisions
to upset her family, me.

19:25.748 --> 19:30.210
Shut up and stop trying to be charming.
I'm coming with you.

19:30.294 --> 19:35.215
- I don't know if that's a good idea.
- What are you, two years older than me?

19:35.299 --> 19:38.343
- You're going, aren't you?
- Yeah. Are you?

19:38.427 --> 19:41.096
- Yup.
- Yeah, I'm definitely going.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.516
Look, everybody can come.
But we're leaving now.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.811
You couldn't tell from that,
but she's really nice.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.857
You decided to join us.

20:33.941 --> 20:37.110
I'm a complex guy, sweetheart.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.511
What are you looking for?

21:45.429 --> 21:47.764
Some sort of blade.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.684
How's your son?

21:50.768 --> 21:52.686
Walt?

21:52.770 --> 21:55.146
Yeah, I think he'll be all right.

21:56.065 --> 22:00.485
- How old is he?
- Nine. Ten.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.737
Ten.

22:04.907 --> 22:08.284
Walt's more worried
about his dog than anything.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.620
The dog was on the plane, so...

22:10.955 --> 22:13.915
- Kids, you know.
- Is it a lab?

22:15.793 --> 22:17.502
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

22:17.586 --> 22:21.506
- I saw him yesterday. In the jungle.
- What? Where?

22:21.590 --> 22:23.758
Over there...

22:23.843 --> 22:27.095
...a couple hundred yards in or so.
He looked good.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.412
What is it, like checkers?

22:53.539 --> 22:56.958
Not really.
It's a better game than checkers.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.555
Do you play checkers with your pop?

23:10.639 --> 23:12.182
No.

23:12.266 --> 23:15.602
I live in Australia with my mom.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.854
You have no accent.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.231
Yeah, I know, we move a lot.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.569
She got sick.
She died a couple of weeks ago.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.909
- You're having a bad month.
- I guess.

23:42.088 --> 23:45.006
Backgammon is the
oldest game in the world.

23:45.299 --> 23:48.593
Archaeologists found sets
when they excavated the ruins

23:48.677 --> 23:53.473
of ancient Mesopotamia.
Five thousand years old.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.392
That's older than Jesus Christ.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.562
Did they have dice and stuff?

24:00.856 --> 24:04.526
But theirs weren't made of plastic.
Their dice were made of bones.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.402
Cool.

24:07.613 --> 24:10.031
Two players. Two sides.

24:11.242 --> 24:14.953
One is light. One is dark.

24:21.919 --> 24:24.045
Walt...

24:27.216 --> 24:29.551
...do you wanna know a secret?

24:39.562 --> 24:42.355
No, thank you. No, that's fine.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.067
No.

24:51.615 --> 24:54.325
OK. Thanks.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.098
Oh, God.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.351
I just felt it!

25:20.436 --> 25:22.812
I just... Come here, feel this!

25:24.064 --> 25:26.107
Feel this. Please.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.778
Do you feel that? That, right there.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.447
That's a kick!

25:34.325 --> 25:36.367
There, right there's a foot!

25:36.452 --> 25:38.953
Oh, my God, wait, he's moving around.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.290
He. He.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.627
I guess I think you're a he.

25:55.804 --> 26:00.016
OK. Wide open space.
Check the radio, see if we're good.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.810
- We're not gonna have reception.
- Just try it.

26:02.895 --> 26:06.397
- I don't want to waste batteries.
- I'm not asking to keep it on.

26:06.482 --> 26:09.525
- We're blocked by the mountain.
- Check the damn radio!

26:09.610 --> 26:12.987
If I check, we might not
have any juice left when we get to...

26:22.373 --> 26:23.706
Oh, my God.

26:24.041 --> 26:27.543
- What the hell's that?
- Something's coming.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.548
It's coming towards us, I think.

26:32.841 --> 26:37.053
- Come on, let's move.
- I shouldn't have come on this hike!

26:39.765 --> 26:41.641
- Go, go!
- Sawyer!

26:41.725 --> 26:43.434
Let him go!

27:11.213 --> 27:13.214
That's...

27:14.216 --> 27:16.384
That's a big bear.

27:16.677 --> 27:19.595
You think that's what killed the pilot?

27:19.680 --> 27:24.726
No. No, that's a tiny,
teeny version compared to that.

27:26.937 --> 27:29.856
Guys, this isn'tjust a bear.

27:33.110 --> 27:35.194
It's a polar bear.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.577
You sure he's out?

27:43.162 --> 27:45.288
He's out.

27:46.123 --> 27:49.334
How do you know he won't wake up
when you yank that thing out?

27:49.418 --> 27:51.210
I don't.

27:55.299 --> 27:57.759
Hey, guy, you awake?

27:58.302 --> 28:02.263
Yo! There's a rescue plane!
We're saved! Yay!

28:03.223 --> 28:05.224
Yeah, he's out.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.937
So, what do you want me...?

28:10.022 --> 28:12.315
It's unlikely
he'll regain consciousness,

28:12.399 --> 28:15.526
but the pain might bring him around.
If it does, hold him down.

28:22.242 --> 28:24.702
I'm not so good around blood, man.

28:25.454 --> 28:26.954
Then don't look.

28:27.039 --> 28:32.001
Yeah. But I'm not so good around blood.

28:32.086 --> 28:34.379
Just do the best you can, OK?

28:41.512 --> 28:44.138
- Don't look.
- OK.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.571
Dude.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.659
- Hand me those strips.
- Dude.

29:04.743 --> 29:08.204
- I need to get this bleeding stopped.
- I don't think I can.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.957
- What? What's going on?
- Just hand me the strips.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.251
Give it to me.
Don't even think about it.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.878
Don't even think it. Hurley, hey!

29:15.963 --> 29:17.255
Damn it.

29:19.341 --> 29:21.843
- That can't be a polar bear.
- It's a polar bear.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.219
Wait a minute.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.638
Polar bears don't live in the jungle.

29:25.722 --> 29:26.722
Spot-on.

29:26.807 --> 29:29.851
- Polar bears don't live this far south.
- This one does.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.311
Did. It did.

29:33.355 --> 29:34.856
Where did that come from?

29:35.190 --> 29:37.650
Probably Bear Village.
How the hell do I know?

29:37.734 --> 29:40.361
Not the bear, the gun.

29:41.822 --> 29:44.615
- I got it off one of the bodies.
- One of the bodies?

29:44.700 --> 29:47.743
- One of the bodies.
- People don't carry guns on planes.

29:47.828 --> 29:51.038
They do if they're a U.S. marshal.
There was one on the plane.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.665
How do you know that?

29:52.749 --> 29:56.043
I saw a guy lying there with
an ankle holster, so I took the gun,

29:56.128 --> 30:00.548
thought it might come in handy.
Guess what, I just shot a bear.

30:01.133 --> 30:04.719
- So why do you think he's a marshal?
- Because he had a clip-on badge!

30:04.803 --> 30:08.222
- I took that too. Thought it was cool.
- I know who you are.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.100
- You're the prisoner.
- I'm the what?

30:11.185 --> 30:13.102
You found a gun on a U.S. marshal?

30:13.187 --> 30:17.356
You knew where it was because he
was bringing you back to the States.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.859
The handcuffs were on you.
That's how you knew.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.361
- Piss off!
- That's who you are.

30:22.446 --> 30:25.156
- Suspicious of me as I am of you.
- You're the prisoner.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.784
Fine, I'm the criminal. You're
the terrorist. We'll all play a part!

30:28.869 --> 30:30.995
Who do you wanna be?

30:34.583 --> 30:38.586
- Does anybody know how to use a gun?
- I think you just pull the trigger.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.881
- Don't use the gun.
- I want to take it apart.

30:43.550 --> 30:47.637
There's a button on the grip.
Push that, it will eject the magazine.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.932
There's still a round in the chamber.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.601
Hold the grip,
pull the top part of the gun.

31:07.950 --> 31:11.911
- I know your type.
- I'm not so sure.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.498
Yeah, I've been with girls like you.

31:16.959 --> 31:19.335
Not girls exactly like me.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.649
Can I get you a refill?

31:42.651 --> 31:44.986
No, I'm fine with this, thank you.

31:45.070 --> 31:49.198
You, sir, can I get you anything?
Cocktail, soda?

31:49.283 --> 31:51.450
Just coffee, sweetheart. Black.

31:51.535 --> 31:53.911
Coffee, sure.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.457
You look worried.

31:59.376 --> 32:01.752
I'd be worried too, I was you.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.130
But you gotta stay positive, kiddo.

32:04.214 --> 32:08.009
There's always that off-chance
that they'll believe your story.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.719
I know I sure do.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.724
- I don't care what you believe.
- Oh, I know that's true.

32:14.808 --> 32:17.518
That has always been true.

32:19.313 --> 32:22.607
You sure you don't
want some more juice?

32:26.903 --> 32:29.030
Yeah, I'm sure.

32:49.468 --> 32:53.763
Ladies and gentleman, the captain has
switched on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.

32:53.847 --> 32:56.807
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

33:02.356 --> 33:04.231
I have one favor to ask.

33:04.316 --> 33:08.069
Really? This oughta be good.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.485
We should keep moving.

34:43.873 --> 34:44.873
No.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.507
Where is she?

34:57.387 --> 34:59.054
Who?

35:15.280 --> 35:19.450
Oh, now's a good time to check
the radio. Not before, but now.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.578
- We're up higher.
- Yes, we are.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.211
Bar.

35:31.671 --> 35:34.131
Hey, we've got a bar!

35:37.761 --> 35:39.762
Mayday, Mayday!

35:41.264 --> 35:43.140
- What is that?
- Feedback.

35:43.225 --> 35:45.643
- From what? What would do that?
- I don't know.

35:45.727 --> 35:50.022
I'll tell you what. This guy not fixing
the radio. The thing doesn't even work.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.942
No. No, no, no, no, it's not broken.

35:56.571 --> 36:00.199
We can't transmit because
something else is already transmitting.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.992
- From where?
- What?

36:02.077 --> 36:04.203
Somewhere close, the signal's strong.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.997
Somewhere close?
On the island? That's great!

36:07.082 --> 36:09.875
- Maybe it's other survivors.
- From our plane? How...?

36:09.960 --> 36:12.920
- What kind of transmission?
- Satphone, radio signal.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.673
- Can we listen?
- Let me get the frequency. Hold on.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.758
- There's no transmission.
- Shut up!

36:17.843 --> 36:20.219
The rescue party, it has to be.

36:22.472 --> 36:26.976
French. The French are coming! I've
never been so happy to hear the French.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.186
I never took French.
What is she saying?

36:29.271 --> 36:31.730
- Does anyone speak French?
- She does.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.357
No, I don't. What?

36:33.441 --> 36:36.235
What are you talking about,
you spent a year in Paris!

36:36.319 --> 36:41.907
- Drinking! Not studying!
- Iteration 7-2-9-4-5-3-1.

36:41.992 --> 36:44.702
- OK, what's that?
- Oh, no, no, no.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.704
- What no?
- The batteries are dying.

36:46.788 --> 36:48.914
- How much time do we have?
- Not much.

36:48.999 --> 36:52.042
- I've heard you speak French. Listen.
- I can't!

36:52.127 --> 36:54.670
Do you speak French,
because that would be nice.

36:54.754 --> 36:59.717
- Iteration 1-7-2...
- That voice is weird. What is that?

36:59.801 --> 37:01.844
Come on, come on.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.890
It's... It's repeating.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.143
- She's right.
- What?

37:09.227 --> 37:13.063
It's a loop. "Iteration."
It's repeating the same message.

37:13.148 --> 37:16.025
- It's a counter.
- Iteration...

37:16.109 --> 37:21.447
- The next number will end 5-3-3.
- ...9-4-5-3-3.

37:21.531 --> 37:23.782
Does anyone
know what he's talking about?

37:23.867 --> 37:28.037
It's a running count of the number
of times the message has repeated.

37:28.121 --> 37:32.875
It's roughly 30 seconds long, so...
How long...?

37:32.959 --> 37:37.379
- Don't forget to carry the one.
- ...5-3-4.

37:37.464 --> 37:41.008
She's saying... "Please."

37:41.676 --> 37:46.430
She's saying, "Please, help me.
Please, come get me."

37:46.514 --> 37:48.641
Or she's not!
You don't speak French!

37:48.725 --> 37:50.643
- Let her listen.
- Shut up, man!

37:50.727 --> 37:53.020
Guys, the battery. The battery.

37:53.104 --> 37:57.691
...7-2-9-4-5-3-5.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.820
"I'm alone now.

38:01.905 --> 38:05.616
I'm... on the island alone.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.455
Please, someone come.

38:11.873 --> 38:15.709
The others, they're... They're dead.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.881
It killed them.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.218
It killed them all."

38:35.188 --> 38:38.232
- That was good.
- Sixteen years.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.818
What?

38:40.902 --> 38:45.698
Sixteen years... and five months.
That's the count.

38:45.782 --> 38:48.826
- What the hell are you talking about?
- The iterations.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.745
It's a distress call.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.748
A plea for help. A Mayday.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.918
If the counter's right...

38:58.628 --> 39:01.880
...it's been playing over and over...

39:01.965 --> 39:04.425
...for 16 years.

39:04.801 --> 39:07.970
Someone else was stranded here?

39:12.392 --> 39:13.934
Maybe they came for them.

39:14.019 --> 39:16.562
If someone came,
why is it still playing?

39:23.820 --> 39:28.490
Guys... where are we?
