WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.771
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...

00:03.871 --> 00:05.206
How long has it been going on?
Six months.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.608
I can see why
she left you.

00:07.708 --> 00:10.411
Here's hoping
she found someone better.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.879
You've been suspended.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.947
You're gonna need to
surrender your service weapon.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.783
<i>50-Squad is off today,</i>

00:15.883 --> 00:17.651
so Rocker's agreed
to join us.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.554
He's bringing one
of his guys with him.
Oh, don't say it.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.056
What's going on?
Rest easy, 20-Squad.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.525
Duty called, and the best
of the best answered.

00:24.625 --> 00:25.993
I never had a big brother.

00:26.094 --> 00:26.994
And I'm not sure I need one.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.629
I really hope that one day

00:28.729 --> 00:29.830
we can have a relationship.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.299
You come find me.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.667
I'll be around.

00:45.579 --> 00:48.549
Ah, patrol day. Time to pay
our dues in basic blues.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.319
I put in my time
on the beat in Long Beach.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.020
Feels like we're just ticking

00:53.121 --> 00:55.256
the community-engagement box
on some bureaucrat's checklist.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.925
Hey, don't let Commander Hicks
hear you talking like that, man.

00:58.025 --> 01:00.128
We're the most highly trained
cops in the LAPD.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.363
Sending SWAT on routine
dispatch calls feels like

01:02.463 --> 01:04.532
making Lebron play
a blacktop pickup game.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.800
Long Beach SWAT didn't have
a patrol requirement?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.136
No, no.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.138
They didn't waste
their lead talent on grunt work.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.739
All right, whoever's riding
with Alfaro is gonna have to

01:11.839 --> 01:13.574
make room in the car
for that ego. Listen,

01:13.674 --> 01:14.742
patrol day's about
getting back to basics.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.110
Yeah.
Luca's right.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.378
It's about reconnecting

01:17.478 --> 01:19.413
with the core aspects
of policing.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.681
At least that's what Hicks says
every time

01:20.781 --> 01:22.350
he gives his patrol day speech.

01:23.351 --> 01:24.785
All right, we should head
to Eagle's Nest.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.087
I'm sure the boss already has
the old whistle out.

01:28.656 --> 01:29.957
Tan.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.993
Commander.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.628
I know it's tough,
but you can't be here

01:34.728 --> 01:36.564
while you're serving
your suspension.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.999
I know, sir. Backpack
was in my locker.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.302
Look, you got a raw deal.

01:41.402 --> 01:44.905
All due respect, Commander,
you can save the pep talk.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.342
I let my baggage
affect my behavior

01:48.442 --> 01:49.877
and cast a negative light
on SWAT.

01:49.977 --> 01:52.246
For what it's worth,
uh, I'm sorry.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.415
Well, you take care
of yourself.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.916
Time will fly,

01:56.016 --> 01:57.918
and we'll be waiting here
for you when you get back.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.720
Yes, sir.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.694
With Street on personal leave

02:06.794 --> 02:09.029
and Tan serving out
his suspension,

02:09.129 --> 02:10.531
today seemed like a good time
to catch up

02:10.631 --> 02:13.100
on our patrol requirements, but...

02:13.201 --> 02:18.005
I gotta say, it never gets old
seeing you guys in your blues.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.139
Here we go.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.509
You got something
you want to say, Luca?

02:21.609 --> 02:24.378
Just that LAPD started
back in 1869,

02:24.478 --> 02:25.846
and has since become
the third largest

02:25.946 --> 02:27.881
law enforcement agen...
Okay, funny guy.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.550
I know you've heard
the speech a few times,

02:29.650 --> 02:31.051
so I'll do the abridged
version for the newbies.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.888
Sir, maybe keep the whistle
section out of it this time.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.891
Deac, the whistle's
the best part.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.629
These guys, they don't know
how to have fun.

02:41.729 --> 02:45.666
LAPD started in 1869,

02:45.766 --> 02:47.201
and has since become...

02:48.636 --> 02:50.671
All right, I'll cut
to the chase.

02:50.771 --> 02:54.708
LAPD has a long tradition
in community policing...

02:54.808 --> 02:57.711
...which is the
cornerstone of everything we do.

02:57.811 --> 03:02.115
And there's no better way
than to get back to our roots

03:02.216 --> 03:03.917
as a force for good

03:04.017 --> 03:06.387
is to get out among
the people we police.

03:06.487 --> 03:09.156
Interact on a human level.

03:09.257 --> 03:13.193
So keep that in mind while
you're on patrol today. Deacon.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.495
You're riding with Alfaro

03:14.595 --> 03:16.464
on the Central Patrol Zone route.

03:16.564 --> 03:17.898
Means you get to roll with me.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.667
Commander, please tell me
we pulled a good zone.

03:19.767 --> 03:20.868
Not so fast, Luca.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.303
I paired Powell
with someone else.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.538
But you, oh...
you got the luck of the draw.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.975
A uni out of the 27th.
A guy named Coburn.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.010
Should be waiting for
you in Motor Pool.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.045
Well, if I'm not with Luca,
then who am I with?

03:32.145 --> 03:33.947
Me.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.719
I didn't miss the whistle,
did I?

03:38.819 --> 03:40.554
No, you're right on time, Hondo.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.722
You and Powell are
in South L.A. today.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.392
Let's hit the streets.

03:45.659 --> 03:46.827
All right, let's do this.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.263
Luca.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.198
Yeah?

03:51.299 --> 03:53.233
I just saw Tan.
Here?

03:53.334 --> 03:54.968
Yeah, he was picking up
his bag from his locker.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.004
Huh. I must have
just missed him.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.339
Yeah, I don't think
he's doing great

03:58.439 --> 03:59.673
with the suspension.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.141
Now, your patrol area,

04:01.241 --> 04:02.776
it's not far from
his apartment.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.412
Stop by and check in
on him, will you?
Okay.

04:04.512 --> 04:07.014
I think he could use
our support right now.
Will do, sir.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.282
All right.

04:08.382 --> 04:09.550
You know, I'm impressed how
you've knuckled up

04:09.650 --> 04:11.385
and made changes
to fit in around here.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.987
Guess Street was
a good influence.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.357
Yeah, he's, uh,
he's been great.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.626
Hey.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.528
If you've got something
on your mind, let it off.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.363
I gotta know
you ain't distracted

04:22.463 --> 04:23.964
before we get out there.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.500
It's just, how are you so cool

04:26.600 --> 04:27.735
with being in this uniform?

04:27.835 --> 04:30.270
What do you mean?
All the side-eyes.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.839
The way conversation stops
when you pass by.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.308
You feel some kind of way
about patrol.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.745
I transferred to LAPD
the summer of 2020,

04:37.845 --> 04:39.580
in the wake of George Floyd.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.549
It was tough on the streets.

04:41.649 --> 04:42.916
People hated us.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.753
It felt like this uniform
was a magnet

04:45.853 --> 04:48.589
for anger and resentment.

04:48.689 --> 04:49.957
You didn't quit.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.392
Well, it's different
now that we're on SWAT.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.193
We only show up
when people really need us,

04:53.293 --> 04:54.695
and they're grateful.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.497
You wear the uniform,
people judge you

04:56.597 --> 04:59.567
without getting to know
all that you're about, I get it.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.503
But, Powell, I do believe
in community policing.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.605
My goal is to show
the community

05:04.705 --> 05:06.273
a uniform that cares,

05:06.374 --> 05:09.042
and maybe even inspire
a little hope.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.045
You ready?
Yeah.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.386
Hey, Long Beach,
I'm driving today.

05:18.486 --> 05:19.787
This is my town.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.655
Durant, what are
you doing here?

05:21.755 --> 05:24.392
I got a pickup to make.
Yeah?

05:24.492 --> 05:25.759
Maybe you can help.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.260
Supposed to ride with
an Officer Coburn.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.696
He-he patrols out of your
station. You know him?

05:28.796 --> 05:30.097
Yeah. Decent cop.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.965
Always smells like
chili dogs, though.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.567
Oh, great.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.569
That's why I traded him
for your patrol.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.671
I figured I'd spare you
the cleaning bill,

05:37.771 --> 05:40.408
'cause that smell really
sticks to the uniform.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.609
You're my partner for the day?

05:41.709 --> 05:43.010
I was pretty tough
last time we spoke.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.078
Said I didn't need
a brother.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.314
You said to come find you
if I changed my mind.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.416
So you do want a brother.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.217
Half brother, I guess.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.819
Well, a full shift together
will give us a chance

05:51.919 --> 05:53.854
to get to know each other.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.288
You sure you want
to do this?

05:55.389 --> 05:57.458
I can always kick you
back to Coburn. Yeah.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.660
Officer Chili Dog?
Nah, thanks.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.695
Whoa, what are you doing?

06:01.795 --> 06:03.797
Oh, right.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.999
Your car, my bad.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.811
The car's registered
to Eric Mac.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.881
Couple of speeding violations.
None gone to warrant.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.684
Thinks the rules don't apply

06:23.784 --> 06:25.352
'cause he can afford
to pay the tickets.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.996
This is the LAPD. Pull over.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.677
Could you turn off
the engine, please?

06:49.777 --> 06:50.911
I'm late for a meeting.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.145
Make this quick, huh?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.413
Let me see your license, registration

06:53.514 --> 06:54.848
and proof of insurance.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.884
Why didn't you stop?

06:56.984 --> 06:58.952
Didn't see you.
Like I said, I'm late.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.021
You know how fast
you were going?

07:01.121 --> 07:02.389
Look, I was speeding, I get it.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.957
Just write the damn ticket.
I gotta go.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.662
All right, Mr. Mac,
you sit tight.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.430
Be right back.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.170
That guy know he's talking
to a Police Star recipient?

07:17.270 --> 07:19.339
2,000 hours of training

07:19.439 --> 07:21.108
just to get barked at
by some jerk

07:21.208 --> 07:22.543
in a fancy suit.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.412
Doesn't matter how much training
we have; that's the job.

07:25.513 --> 07:28.148
To protect and serve
the people of Los Angeles.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.984
Even when those people are
entitled jerks.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.464
20-David to Dispatch.
Show us responding to

07:44.565 --> 07:48.135
a shots-fired call on the 103
block of South Central Avenue.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.706
Nothing. Is he...

07:52.806 --> 07:54.975
He's gone.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.847
All right, listen up.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.882
We're the first
ones on scene.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.417
Go get the kit while
I put in the call. Go.

08:05.452 --> 08:08.388
20-David to Dispatch,
we have a 187 on site.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.157
You see, right?
I'm tired of this.

08:10.257 --> 08:13.026
It might have been
this bitch that shot him.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.427
You know how they do.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.396
Shoot first, justify later.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.398
This is crazy.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.834
Give him the kit. You secure
the scene, and you wait

08:20.934 --> 08:21.902
wait for RHD to show
up. You understand?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.403
Yes, sir.
What's up?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.338
Dispatch says all Homicide
detectives are tied down.

08:25.438 --> 08:26.740
They want Patrol to hold down
the scene until they get here,

08:26.840 --> 08:28.075
but that could take a while.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.877
His body's just gonna lay here

08:29.977 --> 08:31.244
with all these people watching?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.847
Hondo, this is what
I was talking about.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.449
They're upset and...
Yeah. Rightfully so.

08:36.550 --> 08:37.885
But L.A.'s a big city.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.419
Too much crime
and too few detectives.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.021
If this was Brentwood,
there's be a whole

08:41.121 --> 08:42.756
RHD squad here by now.
Yeah, maybe.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.091
Maybe not.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.826
This community deserves better.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.795
These people need
to see results.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.563
What are we gonna do?

08:49.663 --> 08:52.933
We're gonna show 'em
what we're all about.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.803
We're gonna find
the son of a bitch who did this.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.343
Well, thank
you very much, Officer.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.377
I'm glad we got that
sorted out.

09:37.477 --> 09:38.912
You have a nice day, ma'am.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.017
I always say "miss"
instead of "ma'am."

09:44.117 --> 09:45.653
Seems less ageist.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.054
Even if she's
definitely a ma'am?

09:47.154 --> 09:48.789
Especially then.

09:50.557 --> 09:53.193
So, did you catch
the latest <i>Squawk Box?</i>

09:53.293 --> 09:55.328
What?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.430
It's a podcast. Nah.

09:57.530 --> 09:58.866
People just talking
isn't my thing.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.467
It's like old-timey radio
from a hundred years ago.

10:00.567 --> 10:03.403
Well, what do you listen to
on road trips?

10:03.503 --> 10:05.505
I don't know. Music?

10:11.812 --> 10:14.381
RHD's backed up, so they're
allowing us to assist.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.883
What am I looking at?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.417
This is our victim,
Derrick Moore.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.753
Small-time rapper
shot twice in the chest.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.122
Multiple witnesses heard
several gunshots.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.724
Like, five or six.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.258
There were only two spent
casings found at the scene,

10:25.358 --> 10:27.427
but loud music was playing
on the victim's phone.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.562
Rap, with gunshots
on the track for effect.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.398
Which could account for
what the witnesses heard.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.033
Is there more?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.435
Are you familiar with
drill rap, sir?

10:35.535 --> 10:37.637
Well, let's assume I'm not.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.140
It's a subgenre focused on
street violence.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.876
Explicit lyrics often describe
real-life beefs.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.878
The victim was playing
his own Jam Cloud channel.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.915
I did a deep dive, and there was
a common theme to his songs.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.650
A serious rivalry with
someone named "Lo-Dog."

10:50.751 --> 10:52.352
You think the victim was
killed over a music rivalry?

10:52.452 --> 10:55.856
We have any hits on the
Lo-Dog alias in our system?

10:55.956 --> 10:57.825
None, but the victim
rapped about going

10:57.925 --> 10:59.526
to Noble Gardens
and finding Lo-Dog

10:59.626 --> 11:01.228
on a few different
tracks, so...

11:01.328 --> 11:02.896
What's the plan?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.065
Up-and-coming rapper with beef
big enough to trade bullets.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.967
Somebody at Noble Gardens
has got to know who Lo-Dog is.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.837
Well, that area of Watts
isn't exactly on the best terms

11:09.937 --> 11:11.138
with LAPD.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.906
You know the reception
you're gonna get.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.845
I think I know someone there
who'll talk to us.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.847
It was so fast.

11:19.947 --> 11:22.682
He pushed me against the wall
and took my necklace.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.684
Could you describe
the necklace?

11:24.785 --> 11:27.554
A white gold chain with
a teardrop ruby pendant.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.522
It was my mom's.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.524
She's gonna be pissed.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.060
Here, let me help you with that.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.594
When she finds out
what happened,

11:34.694 --> 11:36.129
I'm sure your mom
is just

11:36.229 --> 11:37.664
gonna be happy that you're okay.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.800
Was there anyone around

11:39.900 --> 11:40.934
when the incident
took place?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.136
Any witnesses, Miss... Greene.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.471
Becca.

11:44.571 --> 11:47.841
I screamed, but no one came.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.410
He had this crazy look
in his eye.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.512
I was so scared...
Hey, it's okay.

11:52.612 --> 11:54.782
We're here now.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.651
Can you describe
the attacker?

11:58.752 --> 12:01.188
White, dirty blond hair.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.823
Uh, average-looking.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.992
He was wearing a high school
letterman jacket.

12:05.092 --> 12:08.661
No name, but a tornado
on the back.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.864
Well, Becca, you have
two of LAPD's

12:10.964 --> 12:14.001
most highly trained
SWAT officers on this case.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.436
We're gonna find this guy and
get your necklace back. Promise.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.038
Thank you.

12:18.138 --> 12:21.174
Yeah, uh, well, we got
your contact info

12:21.274 --> 12:23.243
and your incident report.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.913
You are free to go.
We'll be in touch.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.750
What the hell was that?

12:30.851 --> 12:32.152
Just some harmless flirting.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.054
No, not that, Romeo.
I'm talking about the promise.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.123
You know better than to make
a guarantee like that.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.425
Just trying to serve
the people of Los Angeles.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.028
Look, hear me out.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.762
Dude snatches her
necklace, has no weapon,

12:42.863 --> 12:44.631
so I'm thinking
it wasn't premeditated.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.633
A crime of opportunity
like that, he's...

12:46.733 --> 12:48.468
He's probably looking to
get rid of that necklace fast.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.638
There are some pawnshops nearby
that aren't exactly known

12:51.738 --> 12:53.406
for vetting their merchandise.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.043
Can't hurt to roll by a few of
'em and check 'em out, right?

12:56.143 --> 12:58.245
Ah, who knows?
Maybe we'll get lucky.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.654
Hey, hope you're hungry.
Swung by Xiamara's.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.890
She made some extra.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.025
Hey, Durant.
Uh, come on in.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.627
Place is a mess.
Wasn't expecting company.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.630
Oh, we don't mind.
Yo, what's this?

13:17.730 --> 13:19.099
It's from HQ, dated today.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.934
I knew you didn't
forget your gym bag.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.802
Bro, you can't be doing searches
while you're on suspension.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.905
Look, I can explain.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.975
Hold on.
Whoa, what's...

13:31.278 --> 13:33.313
Is that the guy
Bonnie's cheating with?

13:34.581 --> 13:36.683
I just-- I needed
to know who he was.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.251
Okay, you're kind of getting
into weird territory,

13:38.351 --> 13:39.286
don't you think?

13:39.386 --> 13:41.021
Should I go wait in the car?

13:41.121 --> 13:42.789
Nah. It's all out
in the open now.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.592
Guy stole my wife,
blew up my marriage.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.595
I'm so sorry.
Bro, I know you're hurting,

13:48.695 --> 13:50.097
but this is only
making it worse.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.932
What am I supposed to do,
just forget about it?

13:52.032 --> 13:54.134
No, forget about him, man.
They guy's a scumbag.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.036
Okay? To get involved
with a married woman,

13:56.136 --> 13:57.270
be a homewrecker,

13:57.370 --> 13:58.305
that's straight-up
human garbage, all right?

13:58.405 --> 13:59.372
He ain't worth your time.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.941
So why does he get away clean?

14:01.041 --> 14:02.342
What are you talking about?

14:02.442 --> 14:04.377
He's married, too, Luca.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.148
He has kids...

14:08.248 --> 14:09.582
and a wife

14:09.682 --> 14:11.284
who has no idea
who she's married to.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.120
So why am I the only one who
gets hurt in all of this?

14:13.220 --> 14:15.923
'Cause you're a good person.
Okay?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.157
Bonnie and this guy,
they're not.

14:17.257 --> 14:21.028
It sucks, but you
gotta let it go.

14:21.128 --> 14:22.162
Hey.

14:22.262 --> 14:26.033
Look, promise me
that you'll let it go.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.136
Yeah.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.904
I promise.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.442
You think Becca would like
omakase?

14:35.542 --> 14:36.944
Hold on.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.711
You're gonna ask the victim
out for sushi?

14:38.811 --> 14:40.280
Oh, it's my first date go-to.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.482
They're always bringing stuff
to the table.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.551
No awkward silences.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.519
Since when are you silent?

14:47.354 --> 14:48.755
All right,
next pawnshop's up ahead.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.157
I got one more in me

14:50.257 --> 14:52.926
before I call off
this whole goose chase.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.596
Ready to eat your words?

14:56.696 --> 14:58.631
Tornado
letterman jacket.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.034
Am I good, or am I good? Huh?

15:01.134 --> 15:03.003
Even a broken clock is right
twice a day. Eh...

15:03.103 --> 15:05.438
I'm bailing.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.607
Cut around the other side.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.144
LAPD. Stop where you are!

15:11.244 --> 15:12.645
30-David in pursuit.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.082
Our strong-arm robbery
suspect is on foot

15:15.182 --> 15:17.450
heading south into
an alley off Spring.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.701
Stop!

15:34.801 --> 15:36.303
I said stop!

15:36.403 --> 15:38.738
I can't. They took her.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.475
56-David, suspect is armed.

15:42.575 --> 15:43.910
Damn it!

15:50.750 --> 15:54.087
You good?
Or are you good?

16:03.296 --> 16:05.032
Look, he said, "They took her."

16:05.132 --> 16:06.766
I-I'm telling you,
something was off.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.101
So you think there's more
going on here

16:08.201 --> 16:09.602
than just the mugging?

16:09.702 --> 16:11.838
That crazy look that
the victim saw, I saw, too.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.207
He was scared, Deac.
Not of me, something else.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.608
Can I help you?

16:15.708 --> 16:18.545
Hey. A guy left here
a couple minutes ago.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.113
Dirty blond, wearing
a high school jacket.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.881
In some kind of trouble?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.216
Well, it's the kind of trouble
that rubs off

16:23.316 --> 16:24.384
if you're not careful.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.819
He pawn a necklace?

16:26.919 --> 16:28.921
Look, right now we are more
interested in him than you.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.924
So if you're smart,
you'll keep it that way.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.727
Kid's name is Zack.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.630
Brings things in
from time to time.
Stolen things.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.299
I don't ask.
He seems like a good kid

16:39.399 --> 16:41.501
just trying to survive, so,
uh, you know, I help him out.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.136
Well, now he's got
his hands on a gun.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.804
He get that here from you?

16:46.005 --> 16:48.441
Well, don't suddenly
get shy on us now.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.976
Look, he was desperate.
He wanted five grand

16:50.077 --> 16:51.178
for a little ruby necklace.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.445
When I told him
I couldn't do it,

16:52.545 --> 16:54.214
he traded for the gun instead.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.549
Does Zack have a girl
in his life?

16:56.649 --> 16:58.351
Yeah, his high school honey.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.187
Moved out together,
were gonna be famous.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.488
Didn't work out
for them, but, uh,

17:01.588 --> 17:02.489
yeah, they're hanging in there.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.057
They're newlyweds now.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.559
You certainly seem to know
a hell of a lot about him.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.496
I sold Zack
his engagement ring.

17:09.596 --> 17:10.863
A week or so ago,

17:10.963 --> 17:13.066
he came in
with a big wad of cash.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.302
Thousands.
He wanted a ring.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.304
Said they were headed
to Vegas to get married.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.805
Where's a kid like this
get his hands

17:18.905 --> 17:20.907
on thousands in cash?
Like I said, I...

17:21.007 --> 17:22.142
Yeah, you don't ask.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.043
But you look like
you have an idea.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.248
He might have mentioned
the OVPs.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.483
The Olvera Street Players?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.352
What, you think this kid's
involved in a gang?

17:32.452 --> 17:33.786
Nah.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.988
The way he was acting
about the money, I...

17:37.424 --> 17:38.691
...think he might have
stolen it.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.460
All right.
The OVPs are ruthless.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.761
If Zack stole from them,
I'm pretty sure

17:41.861 --> 17:43.196
we're not the only ones
looking for him.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.798
Zack. He, uh,
have a last name?

17:46.699 --> 17:47.900
Thompson.
All right.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.469
I'm gonna need
any paperwork you have

17:49.569 --> 17:50.937
on that firearm.
Oh, yeah.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.039
And the ruby necklace.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.508
Let's have that, too.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.722
Ain't nobody call for you.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.625
Easy, pal.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.929
Just came to talk
to Apartment 2-C.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.270
Is that Hondo?

18:23.370 --> 18:25.004
How you doing, Ms. Bernard?

18:25.104 --> 18:28.441
About as good as an old lady
can expect these days.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.343
Y'all move on now.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.679
You sure, Ms. Bernard?

18:32.779 --> 18:35.882
You gonna make me
repeat myself?

18:37.884 --> 18:40.487
No, ma'am.

18:44.391 --> 18:47.126
Call themselves
looking out for me.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.466
You haven't been by
in so long.
I know. I'm sorry.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.668
I've been a little busy.
It's not an excuse.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.904
I should come by
more often.

18:58.004 --> 19:01.774
This is Officer Powell.
It's nice to meet you.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.445
Since you brought this
young police lady with you,

19:05.545 --> 19:07.514
I know this ain't
no social call.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.915
What do you need?

19:09.015 --> 19:10.750
We need to find a guy
who goes by Lo-Dog.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.720
Word on the street is
he lives around here.
He does.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.356
Do you know his real name?
Where we can find him?

19:16.456 --> 19:19.892
If I did, I wouldn't tell you.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.127
Excuse me?

19:21.228 --> 19:22.695
You heard me
just fine.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.732
Ms. Bernard, there was
a shooting this morning.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.234
I'm not surprised the cops
come sniffing around

19:27.334 --> 19:28.735
when there's violence.

19:29.802 --> 19:32.505
But I never expected you

19:32.605 --> 19:34.741
to carry that water, Hondo.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.743
We're just trying to help.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.712
Help comes before
you're dead, sweetheart.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.482
After, it's called
something else.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.484
Ms. Bernard thinks the LAPD
only shows up

19:44.584 --> 19:45.885
after the worst has
already happened.

19:45.985 --> 19:49.155
Been living in
this neighborhood too long,

19:49.256 --> 19:51.924
and seen too much.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.427
Even Hondo,
with those Billy Dee eyes,

19:54.527 --> 19:55.962
can't change my mind.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.867
You know I'm gonna keep trying.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.903
Listen, I can bring closure
to that boy's murder.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.539
You say Lo-Dog is innocent.
Mm-hmm.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.074
I believe you, 'cause I know

20:08.174 --> 20:10.310
you wouldn't protect him
if he wasn't.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.312
But that's not enough for LAPD

20:12.412 --> 20:14.347
to drop him
as a suspect.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.349
Just have him
come talk to me,

20:16.449 --> 20:17.817
on the record.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.253
He can walk in by himself.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.021
Nobody out there needs to know.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.405
You've kind of been
in your head since lunch.

20:38.505 --> 20:39.439
Everything okay?

20:39.539 --> 20:43.776
Yeah, I'm just... thinking.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.515
You believe what you said?

20:48.615 --> 20:50.249
What'd I say?

20:51.017 --> 20:53.953
To Tan, about that other
guy being a homewrecker.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.455
Human garbage.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.256
I mean, look, I was just trying
to make him feel better,

20:57.357 --> 20:58.758
but basically, yeah.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.394
I mean, who does that?

21:01.494 --> 21:04.297
Well, my mom, apparently.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.767
Your dad was married,
and that didn't stop her.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.168
Or him.
Okay, I'm not...

21:09.268 --> 21:11.438
Look, I wasn't talking
about your mom.

21:11.538 --> 21:12.905
I wasn't.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.541
What's the
difference?

21:14.641 --> 21:15.675
I'm not blaming you.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.876
It's your home she almost wrecked.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.211
Look, I don't know
what to say.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.747
Yeah.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.282
Well, neither do I.

21:23.383 --> 21:26.319
You know, we haven't really
known what to say all day.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.789
I can't be the only
one Who's noticed.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.091
No, I mean, it's been weird,

21:32.191 --> 21:35.127
but we'll get through it.
It's okay.

21:35.227 --> 21:36.329
Will we?

21:37.730 --> 21:39.065
I think we both
kind of assume that,

21:39.165 --> 21:40.633
since we're
half siblings,

21:40.733 --> 21:42.835
there'd be some kind of
a connection, but...

21:42.935 --> 21:45.071
maybe we just need
to admit there's not.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.044
All right, thanks, Martinez.
I owe you.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.447
My guy in Gang
and Narcotics,

21:54.547 --> 21:56.148
he says the Olvera
Street Players

21:56.248 --> 21:57.384
run a collection racket,

21:57.484 --> 21:58.685
leaning on immigrant businesses.

21:58.785 --> 21:59.919
And they're not
very nice about it.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.087
Definitely not
the kind of people

22:01.187 --> 22:02.254
you want to be
stealing from.

22:02.355 --> 22:03.556
What do you got?

22:03.656 --> 22:04.724
Zack Thompson, 22 years old.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.693
Couple charges for petty theft.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.561
Connected into a rash of
smash-and-grab robberies

22:08.661 --> 22:10.096
around Pico Union.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.499
Breaking car windows
and taking whatever's inside.

22:12.599 --> 22:15.234
But, hey.
But there's a red flag here.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.670
Three days ago, he filed
a missing persons report

22:17.770 --> 22:20.106
for his wife Sally.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.575
When you chased him,
he didn't say "missing."

22:22.675 --> 22:23.910
He said she was taken.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.913
So Zack goes on another
smash-and-grab spree,

22:27.013 --> 22:29.015
and ends up stealing
from the OVPs.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.217
As retaliation,
they grab Sally.

22:31.317 --> 22:32.452
Look, I bet that
they're holding her

22:32.552 --> 22:33.720
until they get their money back.

22:33.820 --> 22:34.887
Yeah, but he doesn't have
their money.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.289
Instead, he's got a gun.

22:37.390 --> 22:40.493
Olvera Street is close by.

22:40.593 --> 22:41.861
If the OVPs do
business there,

22:41.961 --> 22:44.096
I guarantee that's
where Zack is headed.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.519
Hi. Uh, looking for
the owner, Stacey.

23:06.619 --> 23:07.687
Is she in today?

23:07.787 --> 23:09.288
She's over there.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.290
Thanks.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.192
Excuse me, Stacey?

23:13.292 --> 23:15.628
Yes. Can I help you?

23:15.728 --> 23:17.263
Uh, sorry to bother.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.666
My wife, uh, works with
your husband.
Really?

23:19.766 --> 23:22.669
Yeah. My name's Victor Tan.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.071
Tan.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.273
You must be Bonnie's husband.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.043
Well, if you've come to break
the news, you're too late.

23:31.143 --> 23:33.112
I already know
about their affair.

23:35.381 --> 23:37.249
Do you mind if I sit?

23:37.349 --> 23:39.452
Depends.

23:39.552 --> 23:40.653
What do you want?

23:40.753 --> 23:42.822
Honestly, I don't really know.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.323
Just... felt like

23:44.423 --> 23:46.392
I needed to come.

23:46.493 --> 23:47.660
I'm still trying to make
sense of it, you know?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.462
Look, no offense, Victor,

23:49.562 --> 23:50.663
but if you want me to sit here

23:50.763 --> 23:52.732
and play lonesome loser
with you,

23:52.832 --> 23:54.967
it's not gonna happen.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.738
I've worked too hard
and sacrificed too much

23:58.838 --> 23:59.939
building the life I have.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.474
I won't give it
up so easily.

24:01.574 --> 24:05.211
Matter of fact, you can tell
your bitch wife that, too.

24:05.311 --> 24:06.779
I don't care how much
she wants my husband,

24:06.879 --> 24:09.415
she can't have him;
not without a fight.

24:13.119 --> 24:16.222
Grab yourself a latte,
if you like, on the way out.

24:16.322 --> 24:18.090
It's on the house.

24:24.831 --> 24:27.266
Lucas Gibbs, aka Lo-Dog.

24:27.366 --> 24:28.668
Thanks for coming in.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.037
I ain't shoot nobody.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.443
Wait.

24:37.544 --> 24:39.546
Derrick got shot?!

24:39.646 --> 24:42.081
You know Derrick Moore?

24:42.181 --> 24:43.783
Y-Yeah.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.017
We've heard his music, Lucas.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.153
We know you guys got beef.

24:47.253 --> 24:50.389
No, no, no,
it ain't even like that.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.158
What's it like, then?

24:52.258 --> 24:53.993
Look, we was
boys, a'ight?

24:54.093 --> 24:55.562
The-- Like, the whole,
the whole drill thing,

24:55.662 --> 24:56.829
that was just a scam.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.365
We was faking a rap beef

24:59.465 --> 25:01.801
so we could get our rep up
in the rap game,

25:01.901 --> 25:02.869
that's it.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.371
You were friends?
Yes.

25:05.471 --> 25:06.839
Since we was kids.

25:06.939 --> 25:07.974
He really dead?

25:08.074 --> 25:10.610
Yes, he is.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.244
I'm sorry.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.846
You know anyone who
wanted to hurt Derrick?

25:13.946 --> 25:16.248
Anyone make any threats?

25:16.348 --> 25:17.349
No, man.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.185
He was only worried
about music.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.888
Derrick never even fought
anyone in real life.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.891
So he had no beef with anyone?
No.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.425
I mean, look,

25:26.525 --> 25:28.127
not everyone loved
when he was shooting his videos

25:28.227 --> 25:29.461
and stuff like that, you know.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.463
People would come
and yell sometimes,

25:31.564 --> 25:34.433
but not like this, though.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.603
Hey, listen to me.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.938
You get back down
to the Gardens

25:39.038 --> 25:41.207
and you find someone
who saw you this morning.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.909
Anyone who can prove
that you weren't on 103rd

25:43.009 --> 25:44.510
when this went down.

25:44.611 --> 25:46.145
You get it?

25:47.714 --> 25:49.315
Thank you.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.319
I'm Sergeant Kay,
this is Alfaro.

25:53.419 --> 25:55.487
I'm Barnes. This is
my partner Wilson. Hey.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.590
We're looking for a kid.
White male, early 20s.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.859
Name's Zack Thompson.
You guys know him?

25:59.959 --> 26:01.694
Yeah, we ran him
in once for theft.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.229
Haven't seen him today, though.
Yeah, we think Zack's here

26:03.329 --> 26:04.797
looking for
the Olvera Street Players.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.999
OVPs tend to post up
wherever they please.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.267
Their victims don't report.

26:08.367 --> 26:10.002
Doesn't give us
much to work with.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.104
All right.
Well, we could use a hand.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.240
Let's fan out,
cover more ground that way.

26:14.340 --> 26:15.642
Suspect's armed,

26:15.742 --> 26:17.543
so stay alert.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.650
Oh, hey, ladies.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.251
Why don't you
come down here?

26:25.351 --> 26:26.585
I'll show you a good time,
you know?

26:26.686 --> 26:28.520
No, <i>papi.</i>
Ah, don't be a hater.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.523
It's Romeo.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.125
Better have our money.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.227
Tell me where Sally is first.

26:35.327 --> 26:37.930
You stole
five Gs, <i>pendejo.</i>

26:38.030 --> 26:39.098
You don't get nothing

26:39.198 --> 26:40.499
till we get
our money.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.701
Where is she?

26:41.801 --> 26:43.435
Not far.

26:43.535 --> 26:44.771
Bet she's getting lonely.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.205
You don't
pay up,

26:46.305 --> 26:48.474
maybe me and the homies
pay her a visit.

26:48.574 --> 26:50.242
Now give me the money.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.382
Call your boys.

26:56.482 --> 26:58.417
Bring Sally here.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.019
Now.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.587
Or you gonna shoot me?

27:01.688 --> 27:03.089
Right here?

27:03.189 --> 27:05.091
I'm not scared of you.

27:06.025 --> 27:07.626
You should be, Romeo.

27:07.727 --> 27:08.728
You point
a gun at me,

27:08.828 --> 27:10.329
now I got to hurt you,

27:10.429 --> 27:13.332
not to mention
what I'm gonna do to your girl.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.009
Hold up. Nine o'clock.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.512
30-David. Active 245
in progress in Olvera Park.

27:26.612 --> 27:28.715
Suspects are armed.

27:33.619 --> 27:34.954
At your six.

27:35.054 --> 27:36.588
We got a standoff.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.157
Three on one.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.726
We got to
move in now

27:39.826 --> 27:41.127
before it spills
into the park.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.328
On my count...

27:43.830 --> 27:45.464
Shots fired.
I repeat, shots fired.

27:45.564 --> 27:47.066
LAPD!
Drop your weapons!

27:47.166 --> 27:48.267
No clear shot. 30-David.

27:48.367 --> 27:49.335
Shots fired, Olvera Park.

27:49.435 --> 27:50.436
Requesting backup and an R/A.

27:50.536 --> 27:51.637
That's Deacon.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.840
Olvera Park's
not far.
Go, go.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.009
Oh, God.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.778
They're gonna kill her.
You got to save her, please.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.479
Wilson, Barnes,
you stay with him.

28:00.579 --> 28:01.848
Come on.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.961
They're heading east
towards Union Station!

28:24.403 --> 28:25.738
Hey!

28:33.279 --> 28:36.048
30-David. Pursuing suspects
into Union Station.

28:36.148 --> 28:39.051
Three Latino males wearing
black caps and black jeans.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.058
Where's that backup?

28:50.296 --> 28:53.565
22-David responding.
Entering from the three side.

28:53.665 --> 28:54.733
If they're
on the run,

28:54.834 --> 28:56.102
this is where
they come out.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.870
You got to skate where
the puck's going.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.139
Not where it is.
What, you like hockey?

29:00.239 --> 29:01.540
Kings for life.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.110
Aw, hell yeah.
Let's go.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.413
56-David. Pursuing suspect

29:07.513 --> 29:08.881
south into the restaurant.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.850
22-David. No visual
on the suspects.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.121
Whoa. Hey, man!

29:19.792 --> 29:22.028
There's a brewery in back.
Funnel him there.

29:23.729 --> 29:25.631
...to your final destination,

29:25.731 --> 29:27.900
please take our ground
transportation options

29:28.000 --> 29:30.803
in the rear of the building,

29:30.903 --> 29:33.940
located on Cesar Chavez
and Vignes Avenue.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.642
22-David. Searching
the north concourse.

29:42.681 --> 29:44.016
Whoa, whoa!

29:55.327 --> 29:56.495
I got a visual.

29:56.595 --> 29:57.729
Can't get a shot,
he's got a hostage.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.298
I'll flank him
and take the high ground.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.872
LAPD! Let the girl go!

30:05.972 --> 30:08.207
Get out of my way!
Listen to me, Miss,

30:08.307 --> 30:09.808
we're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

30:10.709 --> 30:12.011
Do exactly what I say.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.716
Okay.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.651
I need you to duck!

30:24.290 --> 30:25.557
Not today, pal.

30:25.657 --> 30:26.758
Nice body check, man.

30:26.859 --> 30:27.894
You're a hockey fan,
all right.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.595
You should see me
during playoffs.

30:29.695 --> 30:31.864
Let's get your ass up, buddy.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.939
30-David. Almost in position.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.108
Good, 'cause
I'm sending him your way.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.950
LAPD.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.086
You're under arrest.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.354
Come on.

30:55.454 --> 30:56.722
We're still
one short.

30:56.822 --> 30:57.957
What'd the hell
these guys do?

30:58.057 --> 30:59.258
They kidnapped a woman.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.459
And there's still
a suspect outstanding.

31:00.559 --> 31:01.793
We ain't
kidnap nobody.

31:01.894 --> 31:02.962
Least you ain't gonna
be able to prove it.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.330
Hey, what's
that mean, huh?

31:04.430 --> 31:06.232
Your boy planning on
doing something stupid?

31:06.332 --> 31:08.400
No body, no crime.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.568
Right?

31:09.668 --> 31:10.602
We got to
stop this guy

31:10.702 --> 31:11.870
before he gets to the girl.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.439
Patrol has the exits
buttoned up.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.674
56-Tango. Suspect fleeing east

31:15.774 --> 31:17.276
towards the plaza. In pursuit.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.047
We got these guys.

31:27.619 --> 31:28.654
Yo, what's up?

31:37.763 --> 31:38.931
I'm one.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.433
Hey, on your knees!
On your knees!

31:42.601 --> 31:43.936
Aw, damn! It's locked!

31:44.036 --> 31:45.704
He's getting away!
56-David.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.273
Suspect is running east
on the tracks

31:47.373 --> 31:48.407
out of Union Station.

31:48.507 --> 31:49.775
We lost him.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.644
If he gets to
Sally before we do,

31:52.744 --> 31:54.113
she's as good as dead.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.124
We're a quarter mile
from Union Station.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.893
Deacon said the shooter
left the station going east.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.495
Some of the these trains have
been parked here for months.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.063
You think they stashed
Sally Thompson here?

32:11.163 --> 32:12.398
It's their territory,

32:12.498 --> 32:13.865
and we know
he's going after the girl.

32:13.966 --> 32:16.402
We just got to get
to her first. Let's move.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.607
Powell, go left. I got right.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.638
LAPD! Stop right there!

32:53.839 --> 32:55.374
Powell, move!

32:56.475 --> 32:57.743
20-David.
Suspect is on the tracks,

32:57.843 --> 33:01.647
quarter mile east
of Union Station. In pursuit.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.716
Suspect dropped his gun.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.368
Put the weapon down.
Where is she?

33:22.468 --> 33:23.535
Where's Sally Thompson?

33:23.635 --> 33:24.903
I ain't going back to prison.

33:25.003 --> 33:25.837
Where is she?

33:25.937 --> 33:27.406
You gonna have to kill me.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.509
I ain't that
kind of cop. Powell.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.385
Going hands-on.

33:39.485 --> 33:42.254
28-David to Command.
We're Code 4.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.822
Did you find her?
Did you find Sally?

33:43.922 --> 33:46.058
No, not yet,
and he ain't talking.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.293
We found him
climbing a ladder.

33:47.393 --> 33:48.560
Why get on top of a train?

33:48.660 --> 33:49.828
Well, these cars
are all locked tight.

33:49.928 --> 33:51.029
The only reason

33:51.130 --> 33:52.164
to be on top...
If that's your way in.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.965
Let's check out
these boxcars.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.334
Hey, Sally!

33:57.103 --> 33:58.737
Sally!

33:58.837 --> 34:00.005
Sally!

34:00.106 --> 34:01.340
Shh. You hear that?

34:02.541 --> 34:03.742
Sally Thompson!

34:03.842 --> 34:05.944
She's in here.
It's okay, we're LAPD.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.979
Hey, grab that.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.025
Hey. Hey, we got you.

34:20.126 --> 34:22.894
Hey. It's gonna be okay.

34:22.994 --> 34:24.796
All right?
You're gonna be all right.

34:26.765 --> 34:27.633
30-David.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.368
Hostage has
been recovered.

34:29.468 --> 34:32.070
I need an R/A, my position.

34:46.852 --> 34:49.655
Hey, thanks for
riding with me today.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.523
We were good
out there, you know?

34:51.623 --> 34:53.459
Yeah, we were.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.863
Look, what I said before...

34:59.064 --> 35:00.632
It's like
I'm overthinking everything,

35:00.732 --> 35:02.000
and I don't know why.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.235
I do.

35:03.335 --> 35:04.936
It's 'cause you didn't
grow up with siblings.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.238
You think

35:06.338 --> 35:08.140
lack of common ground
means the end of the road,

35:08.240 --> 35:09.808
but it doesn't have to.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.076
How's that?

35:11.177 --> 35:12.578
Look, we don't have
to agree on everything,

35:12.678 --> 35:13.812
or even anything.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.247
I mean,
you met Terry, right?

35:15.347 --> 35:17.082
Of course.

35:17.183 --> 35:18.150
Okay,
we never agree.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.285
We're as different
as it gets,

35:19.385 --> 35:21.653
but he's my brother,

35:21.753 --> 35:23.855
and I love him.
You know?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.924
I mean, that's what being
a sibling is all about

35:26.024 --> 35:27.593
is being connected

35:27.693 --> 35:29.228
no matter what.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.697
Sometimes family
just needs

35:31.797 --> 35:33.599
to keep choosing
each other.

35:35.066 --> 35:36.568
You're my sister.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.305
Even if you do have terrible
taste in road trip radio.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.175
I can work with that.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.810
Hey, you busy tonight?

35:44.910 --> 35:46.912
Puck drops in 30
if you want to watch.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.347
Yeah?
Yeah.

35:48.447 --> 35:49.981
All right,
I'll see you there.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.124
I thought you were
done for the day.

35:59.225 --> 36:00.392
Not yet, sir.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.060
The suspect
we talked to earlier,

36:02.160 --> 36:03.195
Lo-Dog.
Mm-hmm.

36:03.295 --> 36:04.863
Something he said stuck with me.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.164
Yeah, and
what's that?

36:06.265 --> 36:07.733
He said people

36:07.833 --> 36:09.100
got in the victim's face

36:09.201 --> 36:10.902
about making
his drill rap music videos.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.771
Yeah.
I went through
Derrick's videos and found

36:12.871 --> 36:15.407
several locations
he filmed multiple times.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.509
These are the ones
that filed noise

36:17.609 --> 36:19.010
or vandalism complaints.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.579
So you think
he was confronted

36:20.679 --> 36:21.947
by one of these
business owners?

36:22.047 --> 36:22.914
This restaurant

36:23.014 --> 36:24.383
was robbed seven months ago.

36:24.483 --> 36:25.517
The owner fired

36:25.617 --> 36:28.153
his registered gun
in self-defense.

36:28.254 --> 36:30.356
It's the same caliber bullet
that killed Derrick Moore.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.824
It's thin.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.093
That community
deserves closure, sir.

36:37.229 --> 36:39.965
It's nice to see this kind
of fire in you, Powell.

36:41.132 --> 36:43.001
Grab Hondo and
go run this down.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.444
So what happens
to them now?

36:52.544 --> 36:54.079
Well, hopefully
the judge is a romantic.

36:54.179 --> 36:56.081
Kid made a stupid
mistake for love,

36:56.181 --> 36:58.317
his wife almost
paid the price for it.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.352
At least she's okay.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.921
Yeah, thanks to you.

37:03.021 --> 37:04.823
You still shouldn't
have made that promise,

37:04.923 --> 37:06.925
but if you hadn't,
things might have

37:07.025 --> 37:08.960
worked out
worse for them.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.163
Oh, bit of, uh,
bad news, though.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.400
You're not gonna
be able to give, uh...

37:14.500 --> 37:15.401
What's her name?
Becca.

37:15.501 --> 37:16.635
Becca her necklace,

37:16.735 --> 37:18.136
not until it clears evidence.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.538
Hope that doesn't

37:19.638 --> 37:21.072
ruin your sushi date.

37:21.172 --> 37:23.008
Are you kidding me?
Even better.
Hmm?

37:23.108 --> 37:24.910
Guarantees a second date
down the line when it's

37:25.010 --> 37:26.512
finally released.
You're unbelievable,
you know that?

37:26.612 --> 37:28.213
Yeah, I know. Hey.
Yeah?

37:28.314 --> 37:30.316
Look, I'm glad
we rode together today.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.318
You were right.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.286
I let being SWAT
go to my head.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.355
To protect and serve.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.189
That's the job.

37:38.290 --> 37:39.825
I'm glad
we saw it through.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.294
It was nice riding
with you too, Alfaro.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.895
Good night.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.605
Mr. Hudson?
I'm Officer Powell.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.774
LAPD SWAT.
Can we have a moment?

38:00.346 --> 38:02.013
What's this about?

38:02.113 --> 38:03.315
There was a shooting
this morning

38:03.415 --> 38:04.450
a half a block
from here.

38:04.550 --> 38:07.285
Sir, do you still
own a Glock G45?

38:08.720 --> 38:10.589
Now y'all come around?

38:10.689 --> 38:12.524
Excuse me?

38:12.624 --> 38:14.793
Neighborhood's been
going to hell.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.562
I've been calling for weeks

38:16.662 --> 38:18.997
about those thugs
driving off my customers.

38:19.097 --> 38:21.500
But LAPD couldn't be bothered.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.702
Until now.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.904
Did you have a confrontation

38:26.004 --> 38:27.639
with Derrick
Moore today?

38:30.542 --> 38:31.743
Sir...

38:31.843 --> 38:33.579
if something happened,

38:33.679 --> 38:35.947
you really need
to tell us the truth.

38:36.047 --> 38:37.983
If you cooperate with us,

38:38.083 --> 38:40.085
we can help you with
what comes next.

38:41.487 --> 38:45.857
Mr. Hudson, did you
shoot Derrick Moore?

38:48.193 --> 38:51.363
I didn't... I didn't go
out there to hurt the boy.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.164
He had a gun.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.301
I got scared.

38:58.404 --> 39:01.239
We've been on our own
for too long.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.110
And where the hell y'all been?

39:10.348 --> 39:12.050
Another one?

39:12.150 --> 39:13.552
Yeah.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.253
Anyway, I expected
anger or tears,

39:15.353 --> 39:16.755
not resolve.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.624
She refused to accept
the situation.

39:18.724 --> 39:21.359
That's when I realized
that this guy

39:21.460 --> 39:23.194
didn't blow up
my marriage.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.163
Bonnie did.

39:25.263 --> 39:27.633
As misguided as
this lady's loyalty is,

39:27.733 --> 39:30.368
she's willing
to fight.

39:30.469 --> 39:31.903
Bonnie wasn't.

39:32.838 --> 39:34.840
She didn't want
to leave me for this guy.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.075
She just wanted to leave me.

39:38.276 --> 39:40.311
Wow, it takes me
months after a breakup

39:40.412 --> 39:41.312
to have that kind

39:41.413 --> 39:42.681
of a perspective.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.816
Yeah, sorry you had
to go through that.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.452
But sounds like you're
ready to move on.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.086
Don't really have
a choice, do I?
Mm.

39:48.186 --> 39:49.755
Lord knows I don't need to hear

39:49.855 --> 39:51.490
any more of
your breakup stories.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.058
Oh, you've got
stories, do you?

39:53.158 --> 39:55.226
For days, man. I'm the king

39:55.326 --> 39:57.095
of brutal breakups.

39:57.195 --> 39:58.997
You ever have
your plus one at a wedding

39:59.097 --> 40:00.566
hook up with the maid of honor?

40:00.666 --> 40:03.201
Okay, that
I got to hear.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.650
I thought I'd feel better
after closing this case,

40:18.750 --> 40:20.185
not worse.

40:21.186 --> 40:22.454
The community needed our help,

40:22.554 --> 40:24.222
and we ended up
arresting one of their own.

40:24.322 --> 40:25.857
You want to tell me
this community

40:25.957 --> 40:28.259
deserves better, I'm right there
with you on that.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.396
Better funding.

40:32.498 --> 40:33.565
Better opportunities,

40:33.665 --> 40:35.433
all of it.

40:35.534 --> 40:38.504
Derrick Moore got gunned down
in an alley for making music.

40:40.606 --> 40:42.073
We may not like
what his music has to say,

40:42.173 --> 40:43.742
but he had
every right to say it.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.613
What you said before,

40:47.713 --> 40:51.049
about inspiring hope.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.219
Do you ever question
if it's working?

40:55.821 --> 40:57.355
Every day.

40:58.323 --> 41:00.892
But I got to keep on trying.

41:04.229 --> 41:06.297
You did the uniform
proud today, Powell.

41:07.232 --> 41:09.234
That's the best we can do.
