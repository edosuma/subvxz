WEBVTT

01:00.435 --> 01:02.471
One day they were suddenly there

01:02.563 --> 01:03.973
like a flock of crows.

01:05.857 --> 01:08.223
T'ney said nothing
would change for the worse,

01:08.318 --> 01:09.603
things would only get befter.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.193
The first of many lies
they told us.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.239
The first of many
we had to tell ourselves.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.695
“The raven himself is hoarse
that croaks the fatal

01:54.781 --> 01:56.817
entrance of Duncan
under my battlements.

02:00.203 --> 02:03.491
The raven himself is hoarse
that croaks the fatal

02:03.582 --> 02:05.618
entrance of Duncan
under my battlements.

02:06.335 --> 02:09.793
Come, you spirits
that tend on mortal thoughts.

02:09.880 --> 02:14.670
Unsex me here, and fill me
from the crown to the toe,

02:14.760 --> 02:18.093
top-full of direst cruelty!
And make...

02:21.350 --> 02:22.350
Make...

02:24.311 --> 02:26.176
Make thick my blood.”

02:27.606 --> 02:29.392
I never remember that line.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.395
I have to be word perfect
for the audition on Monday.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.108
Was I believable at least?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.174
Come, Billy.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.425
How do I look?

03:06.603 --> 03:08.139
Hey, are you feeling better?

03:09.773 --> 03:11.013
Oh, you look terrible.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.769
Oh, mama, be gentle.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.517
Isn't that mine?

03:17.406 --> 03:19.237
I wanted to feel close to you,

03:19.991 --> 03:21.106
it helps me get better.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.240
What have you been doing today?

03:26.331 --> 03:28.196
I practiced my lines a little.

03:29.167 --> 03:32.125
So it was that, huh?
You're not sick at all, are you?

03:33.672 --> 03:34.672
Hmm?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.006
Have a listen to the radio.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.504
Come on.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.426
Okay, help me.

03:56.862 --> 04:00.025
J when I'm next to you j

04:00.115 --> 04:01.321

04:01.408 --> 04:03.273

04:03.368 --> 04:06.610

04:06.705 --> 04:12.666

04:12.753 --> 04:17.041
j I'll hang around you

04:17.132 --> 04:19.999
j til I make you care j

04:20.093 --> 04:22.084

04:22.179 --> 04:23.885

04:23.972 --> 04:26.930
j three little words
I want to hear j

04:27.017 --> 04:30.976
outside of love, everything else
seems to be a waste of time.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.778
Esther!

04:40.405 --> 04:41.986
You idiot,
you'll break the window.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.313
Come down, then.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.607
Oh, there you are,

04:45.702 --> 04:47.488
if you see ola in town,

04:47.579 --> 04:48.614
tell him to come back.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.454
You remember my ola...

04:52.167 --> 04:53.782
He is not coming back.

04:53.877 --> 04:54.957
Sure he will.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.785
Youre so kind...

04:57.672 --> 05:00.254
I don't even remember your name.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.378
It's Esther, Esther albertsen.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.006
Esther,
like the queen in the Bible.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.211
Yes.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.466
Would you like to come

05:07.557 --> 05:09.843
and play cards with me?

05:09.935 --> 05:12.472
I'm sorry, I really can't
right now, Mrs. Jensen.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.151
Ola.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.359
I'll come back tomorrow.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.522
Where shall we go? Papa says

05:25.617 --> 05:26.777
they closed the cinema.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.108
Let's go to the fjord,

05:28.161 --> 05:29.697
they can't close that.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.572
Where did you get the cigarette?

05:33.667 --> 05:36.500
I found it on the ground.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.917
Shh, Germans.

05:50.976 --> 05:53.388
Good as new, do you want a puff?

05:53.478 --> 05:54.718
That's been in someone's mouth.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.972
That cigarette was smoked
by an honest Norwegian.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.228
In America you can buy
cigarettes in the streets.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.191
But we're not in America.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.614
Papa says were going there.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.030
50 you can be a movie star.

06:14.875 --> 06:15.875
What are you staring at?

06:17.168 --> 06:18.328
Nothing, I am...

06:20.130 --> 06:21.130
I have to help papa.

06:21.756 --> 06:22.756
Come.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.640
I thought you said
you were late, hurry up, then.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.687
Hmm, very nice.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.428
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

06:50.452 --> 06:51.567
As ever, hans.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.239
Very nice.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.284
Mm-hmm.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.868
Thank you, Mrs. henle.

07:01.963 --> 07:02.998
Thank you, hans.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.045
See you next month.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.294
Yes, indeed.

07:07.385 --> 07:08.545
I'll deliver the wig for you.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.635
Goodbye, Mrs. henle.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.341
- I'Hank you, bye.
- Goodbye.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.760
Afternoon.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.833
- Hans, how are you?
- Nice to see you.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.098
- Nice to see you too.
- Come in, welcome.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.685
Esther, are you encouraging
my son to smoke?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.645
Of course not. Hmm?

07:28.740 --> 07:30.856
I told him it's disgusting.

07:31.868 --> 07:32.868
Just kidding.

07:34.621 --> 07:38.079
Yes... how's your day?

07:43.922 --> 07:45.282
You have to be careful, hans,

07:45.924 --> 07:49.416
they're arresting Jews
in telvag, you should leave.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.678
Hmm, I love my life,

07:53.765 --> 07:55.505
my family, my work.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.886
You know, there's a curfew now.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.309
I spend my life in here

07:59.396 --> 08:01.432
listening to idol gossip,
it's just talk.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.020
That's what they said in telvag.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.811
It's all right, I'll be fine.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.526
And besides, we have tickets
for America.

08:12.075 --> 08:12.905
There you are.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.529
All right, thank you.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.950
Youre welcome.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.615
Don't dawdle, sweetheart,
Mr. gleditsch needs that today.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.716
Attention,
all citizens of trondheim.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.428
By order of district
commander terboven,

08:35.515 --> 08:38.972
civil Marshall law is declared
in the municipalities

08:39.059 --> 08:42.722
of trondheim, langstrad,
stranda, byneset,

08:42.813 --> 08:45.396
and the entire county
of nord trondenlag.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.488
"Is this a dagger
I see before me?

08:58.621 --> 09:03.456
Handle toward my hand?
Come let me clutch thee:

09:03.543 --> 09:06.410
I have thee not, and yet I see.”

09:06.504 --> 09:08.961
So, are you excited
about the premiere tonight?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.049
Of course.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.626
Let's just start doing
my, uh, wild duck monologue,

09:13.720 --> 09:15.631
- starting with your line, please.
- Okay.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.925
I suppose she dived
to the bottom, then.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.724
Wild ducks do,
they shoot to the bottom,

09:21.811 --> 09:24.769
as deep as they can get,
and trap themselves.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.933
Rast in the tangle and seaweed,

09:29.027 --> 09:33.396
and all of the devils
own mess that grows down there.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.650
And they never come up again.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.405
And what is this all about, sir?

09:40.497 --> 09:41.987
Henry gleditsch? Yes.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.828
Unfortunately, the premier
is sold out but I'm sure

09:45.919 --> 09:48.205
I can get you,
how many? One, two, three...

09:55.095 --> 09:57.461
10 prominent
residents of the area

09:57.555 --> 10:00.922
have been executed
at 6pm this evening

10:03.353 --> 10:06.436
inose executed were
from trondheim:

10:06.523 --> 10:11.392
Attorney, Otto skirstad;
Editor, Harold langeller;

10:11.486 --> 10:14.398
and ti'heater director,
Henry gleditsch.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.926
Hey, aren't you going to eat?

10:18.493 --> 10:21.826
Hans... you need to talk to her.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.864
It's not safe for her
to be on the streets anymore,

10:25.959 --> 10:27.415
not with her daydreaming and...

10:27.502 --> 10:28.787
She is safe.

10:30.130 --> 10:34.464
Besides, she will be running
the shop before you know it.

10:37.595 --> 10:38.801
Yes, papa.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.765
Queen of spades.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.931
You're not cheating, are you?

10:54.654 --> 10:58.067
Hmm, you look like
an innocent flower but

10:58.158 --> 11:00.240
youre a serpent underneath.

11:05.123 --> 11:10.493
I told you playing
would make you feel better.

11:10.587 --> 11:11.587
Huh?

11:53.379 --> 11:54.664
What are you doing?

11:54.797 --> 11:55.797
Sorry, sir.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.039
Viadimir abramovitz.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.249
Yes.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.005
Then, why does your doorplate

12:01.095 --> 12:03.006
read hans albertsen?

12:03.097 --> 12:05.179
I'm Norwegian, I was born here.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.723
No, you're a Jew.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.169
- What are you doing?
- Stop, Esther.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.273
Papa.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.567
Esther, don't worry.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.354
- Papa will be back, darling.
- Of course, how else

12:20.448 --> 12:22.426
will the Nazi's keep
their hair trimmed.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.815
No, no.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.791
Tor.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.013
- I Rebecca!
- Hans!

12:55.108 --> 12:56.564
Rebecca!

12:57.277 --> 12:58.392
Esther.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.896
Why didn't you help papa?

12:59.988 --> 13:02.195
Sometimes you have
to pretend to survive.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.365
Here, give this to your mother.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.451
Tor!

13:07.495 --> 13:09.656
Please. Tor!

13:09.747 --> 13:10.747
Who is there?

13:15.044 --> 13:17.501
- Esther, hurry up.
- Yes, mama.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.958
Come on, Billy, we have to go.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.966
- Okay, good luck, good luck.
- Thank you.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.264
Hey, Esther, come down,.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.972
Shh, quiet.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.308
- T'he bird stays here.
- No, please.

13:40.403 --> 13:41.313
It stays here. Please.

13:41.404 --> 13:42.769
Let me at least set him free.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.161
Be quiet, shh. And stay hidden

13:56.252 --> 13:58.743
until you're out of
the city, all right?

14:05.053 --> 14:06.418
For the movies.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.976
- Halt!
- Halt!

15:48.239 --> 15:50.025
Get out, now!

15:50.116 --> 15:52.198
- I I'm scared.
- Get in.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.821
Off you get, all of you.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.752
- Hurry up!
- Move, move!

15:56.789 --> 15:58.620
- Move!
- F don't touch me!

16:00.042 --> 16:01.042
Stop talking!

16:01.085 --> 16:02.746
You must be brave, Esther.

16:02.837 --> 16:03.872
Mama.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.459
No, no!

20:34.191 --> 20:35.271
Papa!

20:36.694 --> 20:37.809
I saw someone.

20:38.946 --> 20:39.946
Not now, son.

20:42.283 --> 20:43.677
But I saw someone in the woods.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.987
Hey! Didn't you
hear him? Not now!

20:46.746 --> 20:48.327
I found something.

20:48.414 --> 20:53.078
Yeah, what, your brain?
=leave him alone!

20:53.169 --> 20:55.455
What's the matter with you,
you can't take a joke?

20:56.881 --> 20:58.442
- Let me help you.
- Why couldn't you

20:58.466 --> 20:59.466
give him a real boy?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.960
- Hey, enough!
- Stupid.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.386
Enough, enough!

21:11.896 --> 21:13.056
Over there.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.316
Herr. Krause,

21:22.406 --> 21:23.737
nice to see you again. Johann.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.940
I hope your mission
was a success.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.572
No, one escaped, a Jewish girl.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.373
Boy! Help with the suitcases.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.538
- Here.
- Thank you.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.383
No!

23:16.937 --> 23:19.804
No!

23:21.859 --> 23:22.859
Mama.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.069
Mama.

23:26.155 --> 23:27.941
No, no, mama.

23:36.707 --> 23:38.572
Anyone can follow your tracks.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.618
Who are these people?

23:49.803 --> 23:52.010
If you stay out here any longer,
you'll freeze to death.

24:18.499 --> 24:19.499
Who are you?

24:40.980 --> 24:42.345
I knew you were.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.851
The only kind papa hates
more than the British.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.912
Do you realize what trouble
we could get into?

25:07.006 --> 25:09.463
They're boy's clothes,
but they'll have to do.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.573
No, no, go ahead.

25:15.597 --> 25:16.632
What are they doing here?

25:16.724 --> 25:18.055
They stay overnight sometimes.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.390
Patrols. For what?

25:20.477 --> 25:22.183
For people like you.
But don't worry,

25:22.271 --> 25:23.431
they never come through here.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.929
I've watched them before,
it's safe.

25:28.152 --> 25:29.152
Look, look.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.154
See?

25:37.536 --> 25:38.867
Men being women.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.196
And dancing.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.291
They're ridiculous.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.311
Boy, aksel!

26:11.070 --> 26:12.070
Come down here!

26:13.906 --> 26:14.736
That's my father.

26:14.823 --> 26:15.903
Where are you?

26:17.326 --> 26:19.112
Just be quiet,
then you'll be safe.

26:19.203 --> 26:21.239
Are we having a party or not?

26:23.874 --> 26:25.080
Cheers.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.420
To Norway.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.522
How long have you been here?

26:52.277 --> 26:53.483
They're still looking for you.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.354
Hey, who are you
talking to up there?

26:56.448 --> 26:57.448
No one.

26:58.534 --> 27:00.115
I don't believe you, boy.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.120
There's no one here.

27:02.830 --> 27:03.990
You're lying.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.786
What are you hiding?

27:20.514 --> 27:21.514
Is he dead?

27:22.641 --> 27:23.676
Get help.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.520
Ma!

27:29.940 --> 27:30.940
Ma!

27:32.025 --> 27:35.017
Freq, Fred, Fred!

27:35.112 --> 27:37.465
- He was drunk again, mama.
- What the hell happened?

27:37.489 --> 27:40.356
He slipped,
aksel found him here.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.907
Let's get him inside,
help me, aksel.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.860
- Aksel!
- Hey.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.391
What's the matter with you, boy?

27:46.415 --> 27:47.746
Let him be. Let him be.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.330
"This is
the very painting of your fear,

29:12.834 --> 29:15.120
this is the air-arawn
dagger which you said

29:15.212 --> 29:16.497
led you to Duncan.

29:17.673 --> 29:21.507
Oh, these flaws and starts,
impostors to true fear

29:22.219 --> 29:25.586
would well become a woman's
story at a winter's fire,

29:26.306 --> 29:28.843
authorized by her grandma.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.014
Shame itself!™

31:36.395 --> 31:37.675
What are you
doing out here, boy?

31:38.563 --> 31:39.848
I need help.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.221
Hey, look at me.

31:46.780 --> 31:48.190
How did you get here? =I'm lost.

31:48.907 --> 31:49.907
You know this one?

31:50.534 --> 31:51.694
No.

31:54.162 --> 31:57.154
All right, get him
in the car. Go.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.055
Take off your hat.

32:17.394 --> 32:18.679
Oh, for Christ sake.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.050
Where did you find him?

32:20.105 --> 32:21.220
He found us.

32:21.314 --> 32:22.224
Lept in front of the car

32:22.315 --> 32:23.771
like he had a death wish.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.065
I thought it was an ambush.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.150
Go to your room, boy.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.946
So... what happened to you?

32:40.167 --> 32:41.167
I lost my parents.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.209
Speak up, boy!

32:43.086 --> 32:44.086
How?

32:45.338 --> 32:46.578
They were killed.

32:47.257 --> 32:49.248
We told you to speak up. Fred!

32:51.761 --> 32:54.127
- By whom?
- Bombers, the British.

32:55.390 --> 32:56.390
Don't I always say that?

32:57.893 --> 32:59.008
Bastards, what's your name?

32:59.102 --> 33:01.718
Ola. Ola Jensen.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.311
And you have no one?

33:05.525 --> 33:08.358
My grandmother lives
in trondheim, but she's senile.

33:08.445 --> 33:10.436
S50, we're settled. =yeah.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.610
Send him back to trondheim.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.192
We could use extra hands, pa.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.147
It's also
an extra mouth to feed.

33:15.202 --> 33:16.658
Didn't 1 tell you
to go to your room?

33:17.829 --> 33:19.285
He's right, Johann,

33:19.372 --> 33:20.652
you'll be busy with the election

33:20.707 --> 33:21.537
and Fred cant work.

33:21.625 --> 33:22.625
Will you be quiet?

33:23.210 --> 33:24.890
It's not a decision
for women and children.

33:24.920 --> 33:25.955
Well, maybe.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.460
Maybe she's right,

33:28.548 --> 33:29.650
- Johann.
- Oh, come on.

33:29.674 --> 33:30.538
Of course.

33:30.634 --> 33:31.794
There's a lot of work to do,

33:32.677 --> 33:34.292
and your farm
is very important to us.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.253
And after all,

33:36.348 --> 33:37.178
what possible harm

33:37.265 --> 33:38.265
could a young boy do?

33:39.267 --> 33:43.351
Listen... gonna work hard
and help this good man

33:43.438 --> 33:45.474
in exchange for his hospitality.

33:46.483 --> 33:47.483
Good.

33:52.197 --> 33:55.189
All right, try it.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.121
Shut the door!

34:14.803 --> 34:16.839
What happened, your hair?

34:20.934 --> 34:25.052
It's easier this way,
if the world thinks I'm a boy.

34:59.264 --> 35:02.118
So, what's plaguing my pig?
I've been trying to fatten it up

35:02.142 --> 35:04.508
for election dinner, but the
damn thing is wasting away.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.844
It's not a virus,
or hoof and mouth.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.018
How can you be sure?

35:08.106 --> 35:09.221
He told me.

35:09.316 --> 35:10.726
L

35:13.528 --> 35:16.440
There's no blisters
on his feet or mouth, no fever.

35:17.741 --> 35:18.741
Where did you train?

35:19.451 --> 35:22.409
A healthy pig loves to eat,
so I would monitor his appetite.

35:22.495 --> 35:25.453
Do you have eggs,
milk, molasses?

35:25.540 --> 35:28.327
Put that in his pig feed,
that will get him eating again.

35:28.418 --> 35:30.146
And I'll come back
in a week and check on him.

35:30.170 --> 35:33.287
If he keeps being sick,
it's not worth it's hide.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.697
Isn't there a real vet
I can talk to?

35:44.017 --> 35:45.217
Have you got a nhame?

35:47.312 --> 35:48.768
You've got nice dark eyes,

35:48.855 --> 35:50.220
like Humphrey bogart.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.266
My mama loved him.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.486
Can I call you bogey?

36:04.412 --> 36:06.323
Are you just pretending
to be sick

36:06.414 --> 36:08.575
so they can't serve
you for dinner?

36:09.584 --> 36:11.165
That's very smart, bogey.

36:13.380 --> 36:14.665
Very smart.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.866
This way, watch your step.

36:58.425 --> 37:00.791
We can't keep doing this,
it's too dangerous.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.671
More dangerous if we stop.

37:04.013 --> 37:05.013
Why?

37:06.766 --> 37:07.972
I would lose my mind.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.190
Hold on, here.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.197
Shall I open it now?

37:26.369 --> 37:27.369
Later.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.989
I'll have to leave again, today.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.421
But when I'm back,

37:38.715 --> 37:39.715
let's go somewhere

37:39.799 --> 37:41.039
where we can't be seen.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.710
I need to know this is real.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.866
Do you need any help,
Mrs. Dalgaard?

38:09.204 --> 38:10.364
I didn't know you were there.

38:17.504 --> 38:18.504
May I help you?

38:26.179 --> 38:27.885
How did you learn to do that?

38:27.972 --> 38:28.972
My mama taught me.

38:30.683 --> 38:31.923
She was just like you.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.680
Very good mother.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.191
There's a blizzard coming.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.561
We'll need to stay warm.

38:45.698 --> 38:46.698
Why isn't dinner ready?

38:47.659 --> 38:50.196
- I'm sorry.
- What have you been doing all day, woman?

38:52.997 --> 38:53.997
We'll be five tonight.

38:54.707 --> 38:55.707
Five?

38:57.335 --> 38:58.871
What use is this boy?

39:00.088 --> 39:03.296
Use? I'll tell you what use,
did you do your chores today?

39:03.383 --> 39:05.965
- Yes, sir.
- You see, Fred? He did more today

39:06.052 --> 39:08.384
than you did in a week,
and he drinks less.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.011
Lucky for you, my brother,

39:11.099 --> 39:12.635
you wouldn't be living here.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.135
Lucky?

39:14.227 --> 39:15.717
And nobody else
would have you either.

39:17.564 --> 39:18.895
You're useless.

39:20.525 --> 39:21.965
I think aksel
was right for a change.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.601
I might have found
somebody I can rely on.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.256
We'll make a bed
for you upstairs later.

39:26.281 --> 39:27.281
Thank you.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.614
What are you staring at, Fred?

39:35.498 --> 39:36.704
Go do something useful.

39:41.671 --> 39:43.753
- Good night.
- Night.

39:43.840 --> 39:44.840
I love you.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.671
I'm not a child anymore.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.305
- Good night, ola.
- Good night.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.541
This weather can last for weeks.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.550
Have you ever made a show angel?

40:43.191 --> 40:44.191
Try.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.873
Mine looks more like
a bird that's been winged.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.633
What do you want
to be when you grow up?

41:16.724 --> 41:17.724
An actress.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.931
Papa promised
we'd move to America.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.021
America?

41:24.857 --> 41:25.767
What's your papa like?

41:25.858 --> 41:26.858
He's wonderful.

41:28.277 --> 41:30.518
And he gives the best haircut
in the whole of trondheim.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.324
Does he love you?

41:35.702 --> 41:36.702
Of course.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.947
What's the city like?

41:43.042 --> 41:44.532
It's beautiful.

41:44.627 --> 41:45.627
Well...

41:46.421 --> 41:48.207
It was until the Germans came.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.417
Maybe one day
when they're gone...

41:52.135 --> 41:53.420
I can move to the city with you.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.715
I could help you
act in your films.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.214
Me, you and your papa together.

42:02.812 --> 42:03.812
Maybe.

42:04.981 --> 42:05.981
Maybe one day.

42:34.927 --> 42:36.530
"What beast wast,
then, that made you break

42:36.554 --> 42:37.634
this enterprise to me?

42:38.639 --> 42:42.348
When you durst do it,
then you were a man;

42:42.435 --> 42:44.721
and to be more than
what you were,

42:44.812 --> 42:46.393
you would be
so much more the man.

42:48.316 --> 42:50.102
Nor time, nor place

42:50.193 --> 42:51.774
did then adhere,

42:51.861 --> 42:53.021
yet you would make both.

42:54.864 --> 42:58.322
They have made themselves,
and that their fitness

42:58.409 --> 43:00.070
now does unmake you.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.528
I have given suck,
and know how tender 'tis

43:03.623 --> 43:05.079
to love the babe that milks me.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.657
I would, while it was
smiling in my face,

43:07.752 --> 43:10.619
have plucked my nipples
from his boneless gums

43:10.713 --> 43:14.001
and dashed the brains out,
had I so sworn

43:14.092 --> 43:16.128
as you have done to this.”

43:16.219 --> 43:17.675
Good.

43:26.562 --> 43:27.842
I'm going to trondheim,

43:27.897 --> 43:30.354
my interview with
the national party,

43:30.441 --> 43:31.441
represent the district.

43:32.693 --> 43:33.693
It's an honor.

43:35.196 --> 43:37.027
Not that anyone here
seems to care.

43:39.617 --> 43:40.948
I think that's wonderful.

43:44.497 --> 43:46.033
Fred and I
will be away a few days,

43:46.916 --> 43:48.656
I want you to keep
an eye on the farm.

43:50.211 --> 43:52.076
Better that men
are in charge, right, ola?

43:54.340 --> 43:55.340
That's good, then.

43:56.968 --> 43:59.175
I thought I'd pay
your grandmother a visit,

43:59.262 --> 44:00.718
do you want me
to pass her a message?

44:02.306 --> 44:03.306
Yes.

44:05.560 --> 44:06.720
Tell her I'm fine,

44:08.604 --> 44:09.604
ola is really fine.

44:15.194 --> 44:17.981
Fred! We're leaving!

44:23.619 --> 44:25.359
Hello, ola, come join us.

44:34.130 --> 44:35.336
Help yourself.

44:49.145 --> 44:51.978
I thought I might go out
somewhere tonight,

44:52.690 --> 44:54.271
the cinema perhaps.

44:54.358 --> 44:55.358
Can me and aksel come?

44:56.527 --> 44:57.642
Please, mama.

44:57.778 --> 44:59.564
- I'm not sure if...
- Please, please.

45:03.743 --> 45:04.743
All right.

45:05.661 --> 45:06.867
How will we get there?

45:09.248 --> 45:12.081
I thought
herr. Krause might take us.

45:12.168 --> 45:14.284
Why would herr. Krause
bother to do that?

45:15.421 --> 45:18.584
Maybe to show his gratitude
for our hospitality.

45:21.302 --> 45:22.758
But what will people say, mama?

45:23.888 --> 45:25.844
What do we care what people say?

45:27.892 --> 45:28.892
Okay?

45:30.770 --> 45:32.135
The cinema's in flornes,

45:32.230 --> 45:33.345
so from here I reckon

45:33.439 --> 45:34.929
it cant be more than

45:35.024 --> 45:37.561
six hours to the Swedish border.

45:37.652 --> 45:39.813
My mama told me
there's a safe house there.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.271
I saw the German's map.

45:45.576 --> 45:47.692
If your pa pays
Mrs. Jensen a visit,

45:47.828 --> 45:49.489
I need to be gone
before he gets back.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.242
Can't you just get the train?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.269
1 don't have
any papers, you dummy,

45:54.293 --> 45:55.293
and you know what I am.

45:58.130 --> 45:59.130
Can I come with you?

46:00.800 --> 46:02.600
- What do you mean?
- I want to come with you.

46:13.479 --> 46:15.390
You want to help me? =yes.

46:21.112 --> 46:22.773
Yes, you can come with me.

47:52.119 --> 47:53.359
We have to go.

47:53.454 --> 47:54.454
It's fantastic.

47:55.831 --> 47:57.412
We have to go now.

47:58.667 --> 48:00.282
No, later.

48:00.378 --> 48:01.743
Aksel, no, how.

48:27.071 --> 48:28.071
Are you ready, ola?

48:30.074 --> 48:31.714
Ola, let's go,
the car's waiting.

48:32.451 --> 48:33.451
Herr. Krause.

48:34.370 --> 48:35.860
Was it nice, the movie?

48:35.955 --> 48:37.195
Yeah.

48:37.289 --> 48:39.780
You were right,
the cinema is amazing.

48:41.627 --> 48:43.868
Thank you
for taking us. It means a lot.

48:47.883 --> 48:49.874
How did you enjoy the film?

48:50.010 --> 48:51.750
I loved the dancers.

48:51.846 --> 48:52.846
What's wrong?

48:54.223 --> 48:56.259
I'm sorry, what else
do you want me to say?

48:56.350 --> 48:58.591
Being sorry
doesn't solve anything.

49:00.646 --> 49:02.386
We had a plan
but now we're stuck here.

49:02.481 --> 49:03.687
Stop. You idiot!

49:03.774 --> 49:04.774
Stop, please.

49:06.902 --> 49:09.393
Why are you doing this?

49:09.488 --> 49:10.488
What's going on?

49:11.407 --> 49:13.318
What's going on here?

49:17.621 --> 49:18.621
Hey.

49:20.082 --> 49:21.993
What are you doing?

49:22.084 --> 49:24.496
Please just let me go, please.

49:25.880 --> 49:26.880
Youre a girl.

49:27.548 --> 49:29.337
I'm sorry,

49:29.425 --> 49:30.540
just let me go, please.

49:30.634 --> 49:32.340
Why are you hiding?

49:36.223 --> 49:37.338
Because I'm a Jew.

49:50.321 --> 49:51.731
Does aksel know?

49:51.822 --> 49:52.822
Uh-huh.

49:54.074 --> 49:55.610
And he's been helping you?

49:55.701 --> 49:56.701
Don't hate him.

50:00.164 --> 50:01.950
Hate him?

50:08.088 --> 50:11.876
- Go to your room.
- Don"t tell anyone, please.

50:11.967 --> 50:13.002
Go back to your room.

50:13.844 --> 50:16.961
You can't, just let me go.

50:17.056 --> 50:19.468
1 won't tell anyone
about you and Herman, please.

50:20.643 --> 50:23.680
You can't go, my husband
will get suspicious.

50:23.771 --> 50:25.386
- Please?
- Go back to your room.

50:45.125 --> 50:47.312
I didn't think
I'd find you here, herr. Krause.

50:47.336 --> 50:49.543
Yeah, kind of like it up here.

50:51.048 --> 50:53.084
Come on, are you good?

50:53.175 --> 50:54.175
Good, good.

50:55.010 --> 50:57.752
Boy, help Fred
with the suitcases.

50:58.639 --> 51:00.379
Ola, I need to talk to you.

51:11.569 --> 51:12.569
How was your trip?

51:13.237 --> 51:14.602
I was nominated.

51:15.698 --> 51:16.698
That's wonderful.

51:17.866 --> 51:18.901
I met mirs. Jensen.

51:21.537 --> 51:22.537
Well...

51:23.539 --> 51:25.219
Don't you want
to know what she had to say?

51:29.253 --> 51:31.093
She was happy to hear
that you were doing well,

51:31.171 --> 51:33.457
and she kept asking
when you'd be coming back.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.545
- What did you tell her?
- I told her I need you here.

51:39.888 --> 51:40.888
I brought you something.

51:44.184 --> 51:45.184
Open it.

51:55.613 --> 51:58.446
Well, what do you have to say?

52:00.451 --> 52:02.282
Vir. Dalgaard, that's too kind.

52:03.495 --> 52:04.495
Well, try it on.

52:05.456 --> 52:06.456
I couldn"t=...

52:07.374 --> 52:08.374
I mean, I...

52:10.085 --> 52:12.292
I'd like to save it
for a special occasion.

52:12.963 --> 52:14.453
There'll be plenty of those.

52:22.931 --> 52:25.013
One to scatter, two to kill.

52:34.068 --> 52:36.024
Lucky shot, herr. Krause.

52:36.111 --> 52:39.649
When I aim at something
I very rarely miss.

52:39.740 --> 52:41.822
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

52:45.120 --> 52:47.076
I love this country.

52:48.707 --> 52:49.913
Let's see what you're made of.

52:51.669 --> 52:52.669
Come on, boy.

52:55.923 --> 52:57.038
Oh! - No, oh!

52:57.132 --> 52:58.588
Never point a loaded gun

52:58.676 --> 52:59.711
unless you mean to kill.

53:00.928 --> 53:02.259
Here, I'll show you.

53:02.346 --> 53:05.213
Up on the shoulder,
foot forward, that's it.

53:09.436 --> 53:10.436
There, ready.

53:18.404 --> 53:22.317
Well, yeah! Well done, ola!

53:22.408 --> 53:23.408
Lucky shot, boy.

53:23.492 --> 53:24.948
Papa, can I try?

53:26.370 --> 53:27.610
It takes two strong hands, son,

53:27.705 --> 53:28.705
go get the winnings.

53:30.666 --> 53:31.666
Another one.

53:36.630 --> 53:38.416
Everyone has
a limp now and then.

53:39.174 --> 53:40.454
It's one thing to have a limp...

53:42.594 --> 53:44.425
It's another to be ugly.

53:46.807 --> 53:48.138
You are not ugly.

53:51.687 --> 53:53.177
Do it again.

54:39.151 --> 54:42.359
Chin up and straighten
your arm a little bit.

54:44.198 --> 54:45.198
Try.

54:50.162 --> 54:51.162
It's good.

54:54.333 --> 54:55.333
What does it mean?

54:58.670 --> 54:59.670
It means...

55:05.636 --> 55:06.636
A lot.

55:24.905 --> 55:26.270
What did you do?

55:26.365 --> 55:27.696
Oh, I didn't do anything.

55:27.783 --> 55:29.023
Ola has been looking after him.

55:31.036 --> 55:32.742
Ola is an animal charmer, too.

55:33.413 --> 55:37.281
Aksel helped, we brought him
food and kept him warm.

55:37.417 --> 55:38.737
It turned out good,
didn't it, pa?

55:39.461 --> 55:40.746
He's a fine animal.

55:40.838 --> 55:41.838
We knew she was right,

55:41.880 --> 55:43.160
it was egg and milk that did it.

55:44.007 --> 55:45.747
No, no!

55:56.478 --> 55:57.763
You're not crying, are you?

55:57.855 --> 55:58.970
No.

56:01.441 --> 56:03.602
Here... this is for you.

56:06.488 --> 56:07.488
You see?

56:08.282 --> 56:10.273
Good things
often come from ugliness.

56:12.077 --> 56:13.738
Thank you, Mr. Dalgaard.

56:13.829 --> 56:15.949
Listen, don't forget to put
your blinds down at night.

56:17.291 --> 56:19.623
The Germans fear the British
planes will see the light,

56:19.710 --> 56:21.200
they might drop
their bombs on us.

56:29.970 --> 56:30.970
Well, try it, ola.

56:41.815 --> 56:42.815
Do you like it here, ola?

56:47.446 --> 56:49.607
I can only imagine
it can get lonely sometimes...

56:51.241 --> 56:52.105
Away from the family.

56:52.200 --> 56:54.156
It's fine.

57:00.584 --> 57:03.701
Mr. Dalgaard, are you all right?

57:07.090 --> 57:08.250
It will be Christmas soon.

57:13.096 --> 57:14.096
Yeah.

57:22.898 --> 57:23.898
What's wrong?

57:26.526 --> 57:27.857
Are you ill?

57:27.945 --> 57:29.685
I'm not pretending anymore.

57:33.033 --> 57:34.694
We have to.

57:37.371 --> 57:38.907
Come here, come here.

58:08.193 --> 58:09.433
I

58:22.833 --> 58:24.664
When I was aksel's age,

58:26.169 --> 58:27.284
I was given the privilege

58:27.379 --> 58:28.579
of cutting the Christmas tree.

58:29.631 --> 58:30.631
That's no small honor.

58:36.096 --> 58:40.214
My father's ax,
and his father's before him...

58:41.560 --> 58:43.596
From man to man.

58:50.235 --> 58:53.193
I think you can handle it, ola.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.570
I'll go find a tree
worthy of our traditions.

59:00.579 --> 59:02.410
[Eerie piano musicl

59:17.179 --> 59:18.294
I'm so sorry, aksel,

59:19.056 --> 59:21.672
but you know
what this means, don't you?

59:25.520 --> 59:26.520
Aksel.

59:33.528 --> 59:34.893
I'm going to prove
my father wrong.

59:41.953 --> 59:43.284
What if we just kept going?

59:50.629 --> 59:51.664
L

59:52.756 --> 59:54.371
L

59:57.302 --> 59:58.633
It's all right.

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:06.310
I'll get you home.

01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:15.184
You're going to be
all right. Okay.

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:18.941
Help, help!

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:21.318
Help, help!

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:24.742
- What happened?
- He cut himself.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:30.334
What happened?

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:31.783
He cut himself.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:33.869
Why the hell
did you give him the ax?

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:34.964
Shut up, Fred!

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.413
Help me up, we need to get him

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:37.873
- to the doctor!
- Anna!

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:45.467
This is why you can't
be trusted with anything.

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:46.890
My brave soldier.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:51.014
Just you left now, ola.

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:53.918
Maybe you could give him a quick
physical while you're here.

01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:55.057
Absolutely.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:57.142
Take off your sweater,

01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:59.189
let him have a look at you.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:03.315
Don't be afraid,
the doctor won't hurt you.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.193
The good doctor should be
allowed to take his leave.

01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:07.955
It's getting late.

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:10.457
All right.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:35.180
Johann. Herr. Krause.

01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:36.675
We caught a smuggler
near the border

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:38.171
and we have to question
him immediately.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:40.231
Do you have a place? Who is he?

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:42.162
A man from trondheim,
he helped us in the past,

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.322
but now we know
he played both sides.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:45.689
He took me in for quite a while.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:50.154
=all right, yes, I have a
place, this way. Good.

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:59.041
Ola, come along,
come down to the sauna.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:00.132
Move.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.208
It's down here.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:04.303
Come on, ola!

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:13.010
So, now.

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:15.516
You're going to tell me

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:16.938
everything we need
from the start,

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:18.561
do you hear me? Do you hear me?

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:19.687
Hey, do you hear me!

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:21.359
Hey! Don't fade away!

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:22.982
Don't fade away! Stay with me.

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:25.818
Reichmann on the radio.

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:30.152
This guy is fading away,
keep him awake.

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:31.247
I'll be back in a second.

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:38.080
Ola, ola.

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:40.582
Your turn, ola.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:42.591
You have a go.

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:46.301
Come on. Imagine
it's one of the British

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:47.388
who killed your parents.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:50.516
Go on, boy.

01:02:52.352 --> 01:02:54.764
Show us what
man you are, come on!

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:56.929
Just pretend.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:05.062
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
don't kill him.

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:08.156
Ola! Ola!

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.527
Ola! Ola!

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:17.407
There's a proper fighter in you.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:18.617
I'm so pleased.

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:24.831
That bastard
will be dead by morning.

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:56.488
Why weren't you in school?

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:59.950
- Idiot, you'll break the window!
- Come down, then.

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:23.477
Let me look at you.

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:27.112
Yes.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.240
Great.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.241
It's a very important day,

01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:33.285
the ns election,

01:04:33.912 --> 01:04:35.072
everything has to be perfect.

01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:37.498
Of course.

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:41.502
You know...

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:49.378
It hasn't been easy here,
the last years.

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:53.173
This election is vital...

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:55.717
For the fate of my farm...

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:58.102
And you.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.468
One day, all this...

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:03.065
Can be yours.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:12.605
Youre the only one
who understands me, ola.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.118
Only you.

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:27.131
I was...

01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:29.839
Very poor when I was a kid.

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.096
Like youl.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:39.768
Very poor.

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:51.065
- I'm getting up.
- That's good, son.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:53.395
Idleness will get you
in the end.

01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:01.498
I'm fine.

01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:09.625
Listen, boy, we're going
to have visitors today

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:10.716
from the ns party.

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:14.300
I think it might be better
if you stay in your room.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.130
It's for your own good, son.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.383
I understand, papa.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:22.478
Good.

01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:24.519
Excellent.

01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:26.083
Maybe after this election,
I'll teach you

01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:27.107
how to fire that rifle.

01:06:57.347 --> 01:06:58.507
Herr. Reichmann.

01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:01.513
Welcome to Dalgaard farm,
an honor.

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:09.688
Is this your son, Mr. Dalgaard?

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:12.392
Uh, no,
no, it's, it's not my blood,

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:14.443
but it's a proud member
of the youth hird, ola.

01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:16.573
Frau. Reichmann.

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:20.906
Do you believe in the cause?

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:28.575
The fuhrer has, uh,
big dreams for the future.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:31.581
He will build
a new capital near trondheim,

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:32.673
the northern star.

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:35.915
Go get herr. Reichmann"s things.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.467
S50, my brother has prepared
a very nice glogg.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.136
Please make yourself at home.

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:49.262
Welcome.

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:53.273
Thank you.

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:55.776
- I'Hank you.
- It's so beautiful.

01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:07.572
Anna, a word.

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:24.305
You think I'm a fool, Anna?

01:08:24.392 --> 01:08:26.272
- You've been drinking...
- Shut up!

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:29.678
One has to be drunk or mad
to be with a woman like you.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:32.979
You disgust me,
you hear that? Disgust me.

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:45.654
Mrs. Dalgaard?

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:46.747
Leave me alone.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:49.957
Wait.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:53.462
Come here.

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:06.179
1 have to server dinner

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:08.393
looking like this.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.435
He didn't think of that.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:15.852
Maybe I can help you.

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:17.645
I'm good with makeup.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:32.415
Mrs. Dalgaard,
you look so beautiful.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.794
Maybe you can make me so.

01:09:50.478 --> 01:09:51.593
Are you all right?

01:09:57.568 --> 01:09:58.808
What's your real name?

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.198
Esther.

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:05.742
Esther albertsen.

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:13.201
We should go downstairs.

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:17.626
Would you do this up for me?

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:26.969
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:29.096
Herman gave it to me.

01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:36.638
Ola!

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:01.958
Ola... having a good time?

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:03.759
All right, great.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.097
Would you like some?

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.505
Yeah, thank you.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.090
There you are, ola,

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:13.185
look at you,

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.221
all dressed up.

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:19.684
My poor brother's
little Nazi savior.

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:25.822
So,

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:31.068
drinking makes a man, ola.

01:11:31.162 --> 01:11:33.528
What makes you drunk,
makes you bold.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:35.826
Right, Fred?

01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:37.123
Youre a strange boy.

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:47.886
One more.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.675
Come on.

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:04.945
Come on, ola.

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:13.495
One day...

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:16.578
All of this will be mine.

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:18.917
All of it.

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:22.543
Don't think
that you can come here

01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:24.586
and take that away from me.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:27.256
This place,
you're welcome to it.

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:42.764
So... a toast,

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.608
to another year of

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:46.730
Norwegian pride,

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:51.774
and, uh, to our proud
German soldiers,

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.984
who so bravely are
fighting the bolsheviks

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:55.078
on the eastern front.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:00.792
Hell, Hitler!

01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:06.087
My wife will now serve
the main course.

01:13:06.173 --> 01:13:07.629
Please help yourself.

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:14.052
The war has been good
for you, Johann.

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:15.880
It was a pig

01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:17.840
that didn't want
to celebrate Christmas.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:19.975
Must have been a Jew.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.531
What are you doing, Anna?

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.334
Make sure herr. Krause
is well fed, Anna.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:49.171
I'm happy the Germans
and the Norwegians

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.294
are getting on
so well on your farm.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:54.021
T'his is a very special place.

01:13:55.806 --> 01:13:57.512
We try our best, herr. Krause.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.715
It is.

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:30.497
So, so, Johann.

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:32.840
Let's turn
to the real business here.

01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:36.093
We would like you to be the new

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.091
ns district chief, of course.

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:40.423
Johann!

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:47.100
Well...

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:48.897
Before you speak, Johann,

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.351
about case 43-03.

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:55.442
Commandeering of farms
for German personnel,

01:14:56.575 --> 01:15:00.693
do you object to your farm
being commandeered?

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:01.788
Commandeered?

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:06.081
We, we, we already
host troops now.

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:08.648
But there are
many more troops to come.

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:11.579
It was my understanding

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.084
that everyone around here

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:15.541
is a 100% collaborative...

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:17.001
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:19.929
Let's agree, then,
come on, come on!

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:22.928
Say a few celebratory words.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:24.600
Come on, come.

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:26.855
Uh...

01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:30.567
It's...

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.787
I'm leaving tonight with Herman

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.786
and I'm taking aksel with me.

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.208
- You can't.
- Why?

01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:50.735
Because he's worse
than Mr. Dalgaard.

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.170
This belonged to my mother.
What?

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:19.522
What's the matter with you?

01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:24.907
- Fred, where are you?
- I'm coming!

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:27.925
Johann,
thank you for everything.

01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:29.368
Good bye!

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:46.640
Aksel, where are you?

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:49.931
What are you doing up here?

01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:55.899
We have to leave tonight
when they're asleep.

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:58.523
Are you coming with me or not?
=you don't need me.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:16:59.614
Yes, I do.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:02.481
I can hardly walk.

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:03.576
Get the horse ready.

01:17:04.245 --> 01:17:05.285
We're going on the sledge.

01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:06.660
You were meant to

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:08.487
help me with papa...

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.500
But you replaced me.

01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:12.658
No, it's not...

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:13.753
Yes, it is!

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:17.963
It's not safe
for you here anymore.

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:20.837
Your mama and herr. Krause are
running away together tonight.

01:17:20.928 --> 01:17:21.928
What?

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:25.012
So everyone is leaving me.

01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:27.715
Shh, no.

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:30.559
Stop it!

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:32.728
No, stop it.

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:36.683
Stop it. Stop it.

01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:38.517
What about America and papa?

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:40.530
I need you.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:49.862
Ola!

01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:05.221
What are you doing?

01:18:06.724 --> 01:18:08.134
Nothing, Mr. Dalgaard.

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:10.974
Are you okay?

01:18:26.493 --> 01:18:27.493
Come with me.

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:34.535
We're going
to make a man of you.

01:18:37.588 --> 01:18:38.588
Go get the sledge.

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:50.931
Listen, listen, shh.

01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:01.066
We're going to make you
ohe of us now.

01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:04.979
- No, no!
- It's just tradition,

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.280
we've all done it.

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:07.652
This is how you become a man!

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:31.513
Do you find this
amusing, Dalgaard?

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.348
What kind of operation
is going on here?

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:41.474
You've made a fool
of all of us here!

01:19:41.568 --> 01:19:43.980
This election
is never happening.

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:46.858
But the Germans will still
commandeer your farm.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.280
Wait, wait, wait. Come on.

01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:49.761
- Come on!
- I can explain.

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:51.054
What have you got
to say for yourself?

01:19:51.078 --> 01:19:51.908
Listen, listen, listen.

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:53.202
Tell him, Mr. Dalgaard.

01:19:57.668 --> 01:20:02.002
I'm a Jew...
And he's been hiding me!

01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:03.374
What? A Jew?

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:04.465
No, no.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:35.371
Aksel!

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:40.960
Aksel!

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:44.582
We need to go.

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.584
Somebody go and get the water!

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:50.470
You!

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:53.431
Who are you?

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.135
Johann.

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:58.186
What's going on?

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:03.268
Well, if it isn't
the happy couple.

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.106
Johann, youre drunk.

01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:11.529
Put the gun down.

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:13.720
Listen to your wife, put the gun
down, let's go inside.

01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:14.654
Shut up! =no.

01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:16.406
You don't tell me what to do!

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:18.783
This is my farm.

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:21.160
Papa.

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:24.835
Aksel, don't.

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:29.627
Go on,

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.049
meet me like a man.

01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:33.673
- Papa.
- Shut up, son, not now.

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:36.631
Johann, we are allies,

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:37.725
all right?

01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:44.806
Go on! Shoot them, then!
Shoot them!

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.540
- Shut up, Fred.
- Go away, Fred.

01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:53.651
I already see
what's going on here.

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:55.983
- Go away.
- They've been with each other

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:57.113
all the time

01:21:57.204 --> 01:21:58.410
you were in trondheim,

01:21:58.497 --> 01:22:00.453
trying to make something
out of you,

01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:02.623
they were being with each other.

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:04.245
Go away. =-t hat little whore!

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:05.897
Go away or I put one in you.
Don't!

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:08.207
You're such a... you're a whore!

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:13.254
No!

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:34.525
Mr. Dalgaard.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.155
No!

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:46.208
We have to go! We have to go!

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:55.842
Go, go!

01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:07.106
Get on.

01:23:12.696 --> 01:23:14.436
More water.

01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:27.332
Stop! Where are you going?

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.410
Hey! Where are you going?

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:15.498
We're at the lake.

01:24:58.552 --> 01:25:00.383
We have to cross here
to get to Sweden.

01:25:09.896 --> 01:25:11.306
Do we have to cross the lake?

01:25:11.398 --> 01:25:12.678
It's the only way left.

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:15.853
Is it safe?

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:16.944
We'll find out.

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:54.976
I told you we'd make it.

01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:56.853

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.794
Outside of love, everything else

01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:20.543
seems to be a waste of time.

01:27:28.952 --> 01:27:32.615
[Intense ominous musicl

01:29:28.822 --> 01:29:29.822
No,

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:31.775
he's not here anymore.

01:30:00.562 --> 01:30:01.768
Whore!

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:07.016
Traitor!

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:11.732
German slut!

01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:21.870
Thank you, Esther.

01:30:23.585 --> 01:30:25.041
- See you next month.
- Yes, indeed.

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:38.592
Disgusting.

01:30:44.898 --> 01:30:45.898
Come in.

01:30:57.911 --> 01:30:59.321
I hoped I'd find you here.

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:02.905
Nazi slut.

01:31:04.626 --> 01:31:05.626
Wait.

01:31:06.419 --> 01:31:07.419
Come in.

01:31:09.756 --> 01:31:11.542
Your father would be horrified.

01:31:12.884 --> 01:31:16.923
Yes, he would. Please leave
and don't come back.

01:31:48.044 --> 01:31:49.044
I'm sorry.

01:31:51.715 --> 01:31:52.750
Come.

01:33:44.702 --> 01:33:47.785
Once upon a time,
I became what I pretended to be.

01:33:51.668 --> 01:33:53.704
Compromised, completely.

01:33:56.714 --> 01:33:59.376
But when they left,
I stopped pretending.
