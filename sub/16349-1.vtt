as well make it worthwhile.

17:55.617 --> 17:56.994
Come on, keep up.

18:02.458 --> 18:03.542
Stop.

18:04.752 --> 18:07.588
If you come in there with me, I'm
going to have a heart attack and die.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.506
But, Frank...
Just stay.

18:12.593 --> 18:14.511
<font color="#808080">MR. DARCY:</font> <i>Can I help you
find anything, sir?</i>

18:14.595 --> 18:16.263
Where is the librarian?

18:16.346 --> 18:18.682
<i>I'm not familiar
with that title.</i>

18:18.766 --> 18:21.185
<font color="#D900D9">(EXHALES)</font> You're worse

She's in her office.</i>

18:28.817 --> 18:31.069
<i>Sir, you are not permitted
in the offices.</i>

18:31.153 --> 18:34.448
Maybe we could create a little something
in honor of Dewey Decimal System.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.283
Frank, you're not
allowed back here.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.368
Hey, there, old-timer.
How are you doing?

18:39.119 --> 18:41.622
How am I doing? I'm Frank.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.082
This is Jake Finn.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.627
He's been filling me in on the plans
for the new library. It's his project.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.880
You must remember the days
when this library

18:49.963 --> 18:51.673
was the only way
to learn about the world.

18:51.757 --> 18:53.050
New library?

18:54.468 --> 18:57.012
We talked about it the other day.
Remember?

18:57.095 --> 19:00.307
I gotta slide. The movers are probably
taking a two-hour lunch break.

19:00.390 --> 19:04.394
Jennifer, I'll be by Thursday to see
how it's coming along. Frank. Frank?

19:04.478 --> 19:07.558
I'd love to talk to you some more about
your history with printed information.

19:07.940 --> 19:10.692
You're our connection
to the past, buddy.

19:14.404 --> 19:15.781
Who is that little shit?

19:15.864 --> 19:17.658
BOY 1: My grandma
has one of these.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.062
BOY 2: Yeah,
but this one's sweet.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.577
I heard of these ones.

19:20.661 --> 19:22.579
It's got advanced legs.

19:24.623 --> 19:26.625
Warning. Do not molest me.

19:27.835 --> 19:29.670
What are these assholes doing?

19:29.753 --> 19:33.173
It's okay. The books are going,
but they're going to scan

19:33.257 --> 19:36.385
whatever they don't already have
and then they'll recycle them.

19:36.468 --> 19:39.096
It's like goddamn
Nazi Germany in here.

19:40.472 --> 19:43.016
I know it's upsetting,
but it's okay.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.936
Come on. Let me
show you something.

19:46.603 --> 19:50.190
These will not be recycled.
These are the real deal.

19:53.235 --> 19:56.405
Now, this is our
most valuable book.

19:58.282 --> 19:59.491
Look at that.

19:59.575 --> 20:00.701
Do you get to
keep these, at least?

20:00.784 --> 20:02.369
<font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES)</font> I Wish.

20:02.452 --> 20:05.873
No. They have to be
very carefully preserved.

20:05.956 --> 20:09.835
And they're just too old to be handled anymore.
It's really a shame.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.503
It sounds like the same people
who stopped coming here

20:11.587 --> 20:13.005
want to take away what's yours.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.339
No, they're not
the ones that left.

20:14.423 --> 20:17.259
They're just kids that think
books are cool again.

20:18.552 --> 20:21.013
Mmm. That's a beautiful one.

20:24.016 --> 20:26.685
Hey! Beat it,
you little bastards!

20:30.564 --> 20:34.026
What's the matter, you can harass
old men, but you can't handle kids?

20:34.109 --> 20:36.653
I told them to stop,
but they wouldn't listen.

20:36.737 --> 20:39.239
The next time that happens,
just say,

20:39.323 --> 20:41.700
"Self-destruct sequence
initialized."

20:41.783 --> 20:44.328
And then start
counting down from 10.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.872
Why would I do that, Frank?

20:47.664 --> 20:49.458
Let's go to Harry's.

20:58.634 --> 21:01.011
Have you smelled
our lavender heart soaps?

21:02.304 --> 21:04.097
We should be going, Frank.

21:04.181 --> 21:06.516
What a cute little
helper you have.

21:09.186 --> 21:10.312
What is in your pocket?

21:10.646 --> 21:13.523
I'm sorry, young lady.
I couldn't quite hear you.

21:13.607 --> 21:17.152
What is in your pocket? I'm going
to make a citizen's arrest.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.947
Nothing. Nothing's
in my pockets. Look.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.198
Frank.

21:23.659 --> 21:24.660
It's time we head home.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.536
Yeah.

21:27.204 --> 21:29.289
If you'll excuse us, ladies.

21:29.373 --> 21:31.249
Nice to see you.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.544
Have a good one.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.341
Listen, you don't have
to argue with me.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.551
I'm stuck with the damn thing.

21:41.635 --> 21:43.929
Did you talk to your brother?

21:44.012 --> 21:47.057
She doesn't like you.
I don't like you, either.

21:48.225 --> 21:49.810
Yeah, yeah.

21:49.893 --> 21:52.437
It is creepy.
He's cramping my style.

21:53.730 --> 21:57.484
No. By all means, go ahead.
You let him have it.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.070
Yeah. Bye.

22:02.406 --> 22:05.158
Well, looks like maybe you're
going to be out of my hair soon.

22:05.242 --> 22:08.662
Is your daughter politically
aligned against robot labor?

22:08.745 --> 22:11.748
Hey, where did this come from?

22:12.249 --> 22:13.750
From the store.

22:14.376 --> 22:15.335
Remember?

22:15.419 --> 22:18.505
Yeah, of course I remember, but
what did you do? Did you...

22:18.588 --> 22:20.340
You put this in here?
You took this?

22:20.424 --> 22:21.508
I saw you had it,

22:21.591 --> 22:24.511
but the shopkeeper distracted
you and you forgot it.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.263
I took it for you.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.520
Did I do something
wrong, Frank?

22:36.606 --> 22:37.816
Come on.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.656
You know what stealing is?

22:44.740 --> 22:46.825
The act of a person who steals.

22:46.908 --> 22:49.536
Taking property without
permission or right.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.121
Yeah, I guess.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.125
You stole this.

22:56.835 --> 22:59.046
How do you feel about that?

22:59.129 --> 23:01.214
I don't have any
thoughts on that.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.803
They didn't program you
about stealing,

23:07.971 --> 23:10.057
shoplifting, robbery?

23:10.140 --> 23:14.227
I have working definitions for those terms.
I don't understand.

23:14.311 --> 23:15.729
Do you want something
for dessert?

23:15.812 --> 23:19.649
Do you have any programming
that makes you obey the law?

23:19.733 --> 23:23.570
Do you want me to incorporate state and
federal law directly into my programming?

23:23.653 --> 23:25.989
No, you leave it as it is.

23:29.951 --> 23:31.620
You're starting to grow on me.

23:31.703 --> 23:32.913
Thank you, Frank.

23:32.996 --> 23:34.331
It's time for your enema.

23:38.210 --> 23:41.004
<font color="#808080">FRANK:</font> Okay. Let's see
what you can do.

23:43.215 --> 23:46.384

23:46.468 --> 23:48.970
And the only key is the key.

23:49.054 --> 23:52.432
No lock is perfect and
any lock can be picked.

Okay, your turn.

24:00.690 --> 24:04.778
I think this hobby would be more
beneficial for you than me, Frank.

24:05.737 --> 24:07.906
Teaching you is the hobby.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.866
Okay, go.

24:16.164 --> 24:20.418
You know, I did six years for one
stretch and then I did 10 for another.

24:20.502 --> 24:23.755
I did know that, but Hunter
told me not to mention it.

24:23.839 --> 24:28.385
According to your file, you were first
arrested for possessing stolen goods,

24:28.468 --> 24:30.178
and then tax evasion.

24:30.262 --> 24:34.099
That tax evasion rap was garbage.
I was a second-story man.

24:34.182 --> 24:35.308
What's that?

24:35.392 --> 24:38.937
Finding a way in
where no way in exists.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.940
Like climbing up
to the second story.

24:42.899 --> 24:45.360
I specialized in jewelry.
Diamonds.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.612
You want the most
value by the ounce

24:47.696 --> 24:52.200
when you're rappelling down a 50-story
casino in the middle of a hurricane.

24:52.701 --> 24:54.661
And the women back then.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.330
The most value by the ounce?

24:57.414 --> 25:01.084
I always went high-end.
That way, nobody gets hurt.

25:01.168 --> 25:02.961
Except for the insurance
company crooks.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.894
We're going to clean up.

25:22.814 --> 25:26.026
I thought you said
the library was closed, Frank.

25:26.109 --> 25:28.403
This is what
they call "casing."

25:37.495 --> 25:38.997
To your right.

25:40.332 --> 25:43.210
Oh, Frank, the library's
closed for renovations.

25:43.585 --> 25:46.713
Oh. Well, we were
just taking a walk

25:46.796 --> 25:48.590
and I thought we'd
stop by and say hello.

25:49.799 --> 25:51.176
Hello.
Hi.

25:51.885 --> 25:53.053
Is this your new robot?

25:55.013 --> 25:56.389
Yes, it is.

25:56.681 --> 25:59.643
Hey, there. I'm Jennifer.
What's your name?

25:59.935 --> 26:01.186
I don't have a name.

26:01.269 --> 26:02.646
Oh, Frank, you have to name it.

26:03.188 --> 26:05.232
This is Mr. Darcy.
He's my helper.

26:05.649 --> 26:07.442
A very reliable model.

26:07.984 --> 26:09.319
Thank you.

26:12.781 --> 26:15.867
I'm glad you're here,
Frank. All this change.

26:15.951 --> 26:18.578
It doesn't feel like
home here anymore.

26:19.162 --> 26:22.415
What's the point of a library if
you can't check out the books?

26:22.499 --> 26:25.669
It's all about
augmented reality stuff now.

26:26.127 --> 26:29.172
Jake says it's about
the library experience.

26:29.256 --> 26:32.092
When people can get any book,
any time, any place, instantly,

26:32.175 --> 26:37.555
this building
is about community now.

26:38.556 --> 26:40.475
Community. Yeah, right.

26:41.851 --> 26:42.978
Jake?

26:44.187 --> 26:49.234
They're going to have this big
fundraiser party-thing on Friday

26:49.317 --> 26:52.696
and all the young, hoity-toity
couples are going to come.

26:52.779 --> 26:53.780
It sounds awful.

26:53.863 --> 26:55.991
Yeah. Do you want
to come with me?

26:58.618 --> 26:59.703
Yes.

27:01.663 --> 27:02.747
Cool.

27:08.712 --> 27:12.132
See that? A magnetic alarm that
trips when the door opens.

27:12.215 --> 27:14.551
And there, a night-vision
security camera.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.636
It's simple,
but it's effective.

27:16.720 --> 27:20.849
Frank, you don't have any free
activity time scheduled after sunset.

27:21.474 --> 27:22.559
What?

27:24.227 --> 27:25.770
It's just one night.

27:25.854 --> 27:28.440
And what's the point
of an arbitrary schedule?

27:28.523 --> 27:32.652
The schedule is the most important part.
It helps you remain oriented.

27:32.736 --> 27:34.529
Can we do it during the day?

27:34.612 --> 27:37.324
No. The whole point is
not to be seen.

27:37.407 --> 27:40.076
We have to be quiet.
It's got to be dark.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.203
We gotta sneak in.

27:43.246 --> 27:45.373
I don't know if I can sneak.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.500
Hunter brought you here
to help me,

27:47.584 --> 27:48.960
but I don't need
that kind of help.

27:49.044 --> 27:51.338
You want to be partners?
Let's be partners.

27:51.421 --> 27:54.799
You said yourself,
I need a project.

27:54.883 --> 27:58.553
I do. I need something to keep me
stimulated, to keep me exercised.

27:58.636 --> 28:00.180
Look, this is it.

28:04.142 --> 28:05.560

46:02.136 --> 46:03.637
Hi!

46:06.640 --> 46:08.559
What a surprise.

46:08.642 --> 46:11.603
And then I just thought, why not
just book a ticket to New York

46:11.687 --> 46:13.981
and I can visit Mom, too,

46:14.523 --> 46:17.123

in your bags, Madison?

No.

No, thank you.

46:22.197 --> 46:24.533
Let the robot
get your damn bags, honey.

46:24.616 --> 46:27.369
Daddy, that's why I'm here.

46:28.120 --> 46:30.664
I thought about what you said
and I'm going to stay with you.

46:55.898 --> 46:59.193
Oh. Turkmenistan.
I mean, amazing, amazing.

46:59.776 --> 47:01.236
I fell in love with the people.

47:01.320 --> 47:02.863
They've been through so much.

I'm talking about.

47:07.493 --> 47:10.329

the grant proposal.

47:10.412 --> 47:12.956
And I thought, what better place to
write than this old place, you know?

47:13.040 --> 47:15.125
That's why it's so perfect.

47:15.459 --> 47:18.212
It's so beautiful, but so sad.

47:19.254 --> 47:21.089
But so beautiful.

Morning.

Are you hungry?
Yeah.

48:06.552 --> 48:08.887
I went shopping.
I got you Cap'n Crunch.

48:08.971 --> 48:11.682
The robot used to make me
a really great breakfast.

48:11.765 --> 48:13.850
I went out and got all this.

48:14.518 --> 48:17.437
Come on, honey. Why don't we
just wake the little guy up?

48:17.521 --> 48:19.481
He can cook,
he can do the dishes.

48:19.565 --> 48:21.650
No, no.
I am going to do it.

48:22.484 --> 48:26.780
You can't just whisk away all your
responsibilities on your robot, Daddy.

49:13.368 --> 49:15.704
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?

49:15.787 --> 49:16.788
I'm hungry.

Okay, let me
make you something.

49:19.541 --> 49:22.502
Damn it, Daddy, stop!
Let me make you something.

49:22.586 --> 49:24.588
Fine. I want lasagna.

49:24.671 --> 49:26.340
Okay. Okay.

49:29.384 --> 49:30.886
I can do lasagna.

49:39.394 --> 49:41.730
Daddy, Harry's is gone,
remember?

49:42.356 --> 49:44.650
And I spent an hour
making this.

49:44.733 --> 49:47.527
What are you talking about?
I ate there last week.

49:47.611 --> 49:49.696
Would you just eat it, please?

49:54.660 --> 49:56.828
How long are you
going to be here?

49:56.912 --> 49:58.830
As long as you need me.

50:00.082 --> 50:01.375
I'm fine.

50:07.297 --> 50:10.759
Dad, what did you do
in the bathroom?

50:10.842 --> 50:12.177
Seriously.

50:12.928 --> 50:14.262
It's your cooking.

50:16.181 --> 50:17.557
Very funny.

50:19.101 --> 50:22.354

in to town just for fun.

That's good for you and the robot. I'm tired.
It's too late for town.

turned the robot on, didn't you?

51:40.015 --> 51:42.225
The robot?
I didn't turn the robot on.

51:42.309 --> 51:44.478
I can clean a kitchen.
I'm an adult.

51:44.561 --> 51:46.813
This place was a pig sty last night.
Look at it now.

51:46.897 --> 51:48.398
Please turn him back on.

51:48.482 --> 51:50.442
No, I'm not going
to turn the robot on.

51:50.525 --> 51:53.028
You're not?
Fine, then, here.

51:53.111 --> 51:55.363
Why don't you clean this up?

51:56.364 --> 51:59.242
Daddy! You don't think
I can do anything?

51:59.326 --> 52:01.536
The robot is not
your servant, Maddy!

52:01.620 --> 52:03.705
You don't turn him on and
off like he's a slave!

52:03.789 --> 52:07.417
Okay, I did it! Okay?
I used the robot!

52:07.793 --> 52:12.214

I don't know what to do!

52:12.297 --> 52:16.051
Okay, all right. Calm down, it's okay.
I'm sorry.

52:16.134 --> 52:18.720
I shouldn't have yelled.
It's just that...

52:18.804 --> 52:21.807
It's not you. It's not you.
I need him.

52:21.890 --> 52:23.308
No, you don't.
I do.

52:23.391 --> 52:25.602
You don't understand.
I need him.

52:25.685 --> 52:27.687
What do you need him for?

52:29.397 --> 52:30.941
He's my friend.

52:40.617 --> 52:41.618
Hi, there.

52:41.701 --> 52:45.121
So, we'll let it help us out
with a few little chores,

52:45.205 --> 52:47.916
but we can't get
too reliant on it, okay?

52:48.458 --> 52:49.584
Okay.

52:51.002 --> 52:52.504
Thanks, honey.

52:54.381 --> 52:57.008
We got to move soon. Tonight.

52:57.092 --> 52:58.635
The window's almost closed.

52:58.718 --> 53:00.428
I will listen to
your proposal, Frank,

53:00.512 --> 53:02.222
and make my decision,
as we agreed.

53:05.600 --> 53:09.855
<font color="#808080">FRANK:</font> I did this for years. Years.
And I developed my own system.

53:09.938 --> 53:14.150
Always worked alone, so nobody
knows it but me. Until now.

53:14.484 --> 53:16.653
Who, When, Where, and What.

53:17.112 --> 53:18.154
First, the Who.

53:19.281 --> 53:22.659
<i>The lovely couple
are Ava Lee and Jake Finn.</i>

53:22.742 --> 53:25.161
<i>Married three years.
The money's on her side.</i>

53:25.245 --> 53:28.665
<i>She's a lawyer. He's a
consultant, whatever that means.</i>

53:29.749 --> 53:32.586
<i>They own this house
and an apartment in the city.</i>

53:32.669 --> 53:34.754
<i>They spend just about
half their time here.</i>

53:36.965 --> 53:41.219
<i>When they're out here, they always leave
for some kind of event or vacation.</i>

53:41.303 --> 53:43.263
<i>That's our When.</i>

53:43.346 --> 53:45.181
<i>That brings us to What.</i>

53:45.265 --> 53:47.851
<i>As in, "What are we stealing?"</i>

53:47.934 --> 53:52.564
<i>She has at least two pieces
that have to be in that house.</i>

53:52.647 --> 53:54.774
<i>But how to go in?
That's our next</i>

53:55.483 --> 53:58.612
Where. I found the plans
on their architect's site.

53:58.695 --> 54:01.114
<i>I have our entry path
sketched out.</i>

54:01.197 --> 54:02.741
I have 10 possible exits,

54:02.824 --> 54:04.451
<i>20 different scenarios,</i>

54:04.534 --> 54:07.412

houseguests, et cetera.

54:08.330 --> 54:09.372

<font color="#808080">ROBOT:</font> <i>But what about the How?</i>

54:13.335 --> 54:16.129
A home like this will have
an advanced security system.

54:16.212 --> 54:20.675
Aren't you just adorable? This is
where my years of experience come in.

54:22.010 --> 54:26.306
<i>Every security system is designed
by security companies, not thieves.</i>

54:26.389 --> 54:30.185
<i>It's not a question of if a thief
can break in, it's how long.</i>

54:30.852 --> 54:32.312
<i>They place
all the heavy systems</i>

54:32.395 --> 54:34.230
<i>where their customers
can see them.</i>

54:34.314 --> 54:37.025
<i>They're selling
the feel of security.</i>

54:37.108 --> 54:41.446
<i>It's never hard to find a spot that
they assumed no one could reach.</i>

54:42.113 --> 54:44.032
<i>It just takes the right eye.</i>

54:44.115 --> 54:47.118

that way in, Frank?</i>

54:51.790 --> 54:55.251
<i>There's no alarm here.
Just a flimsy little lock.</i>

55:06.846 --> 55:08.723
<i>They're asking for it.</i>

55:10.350 --> 55:12.060
<i>That brings us to the safe.</i>

55:12.143 --> 55:15.355
I'll bet you a steak dinner,
we'll find it right here.

55:18.650 --> 55:20.151
Do you know
the correct combination?

55:20.235 --> 55:21.778
That's where you come in.

55:21.861 --> 55:22.862
Me?

55:23.321 --> 55:24.990
<i>You're going
to brute-force it.</i>

55:25.073 --> 55:26.533
<font color="#808080">ROBOT:</font> <i>Brute force?</i>

55:26.616 --> 55:28.493
<i>That sounds like it might
attract attention.</i>

55:28.576 --> 55:30.412
<i>All it means is,
you're going to try</i>

55:30.495 --> 55:32.539
<i>every combination
until you get it right.</i>

55:32.622 --> 55:35.291
That would take
a human like me weeks.

55:35.375 --> 55:36.626
How long would it take you?

55:36.710 --> 55:38.878
Assuming it's
a three-number combination,

55:38.962 --> 55:41.172
somewhere between four seconds

55:41.673 --> 55:43.758
and one hour and 43 minutes.

55:48.096 --> 55:49.681
<font color="#808080">FRANK:</font> <i>It's perfection.</i>

55:49.764 --> 55:51.975
<i>We know there's something
worth stealing.</i>

55:52.058 --> 55:55.937
<i>We know when to go in, how to
get in, and how to get out.</i>

55:58.106 --> 56:00.859
It would be a crime
not to do it.

56:20.545 --> 56:22.047
So, how about it?

56:22.130 --> 56:23.715
You have been thorough, Frank.

56:23.798 --> 56:27.719
It is unlikely we'd be seen and
even less likely we'd be caught.

56:27.802 --> 56:29.721
But although your
memory has improved,

56:29.804 --> 56:31.181
you still have
a long way to go.

56:31.264 --> 56:33.600
I'm fine.
I can handle this.

56:33.683 --> 56:34.684
Are you in?

56:37.687 --> 56:41.149
Only if you agree to eat a
low-sodium diet from now on.

56:43.651 --> 56:45.570
Okay.
Okay.

56:51.284 --> 56:54.162
What? What is it?
I'm trash to you?

56:55.163 --> 56:57.165
You're acting like a baby.

56:59.667 --> 57:01.294
Am I a bad baby?

57:13.348 --> 57:14.849
<font color="#808080">FRANK:</font> Oh, shit.

57:15.308 --> 57:16.559
Is something wrong?

57:16.643 --> 57:19.896
What are these people doing
with this kind of stuff?

57:19.979 --> 57:21.106
I don't understand.

57:21.856 --> 57:23.858
Oh, this is way too hot.

57:24.818 --> 57:26.027
Look at that.

57:30.532 --> 57:32.992
We're just going to have
to sit on this, that's all.

57:33.076 --> 57:35.703
We're just going
to have to sit on it.

57:36.538 --> 57:38.373
It'll be fine. Yeah.

58:00.103 --> 58:02.188
I made yours virgin, Frank.

58:02.272 --> 58:04.607
Come on, buddy, I got troubles.

58:04.691 --> 58:07.026
I need a little booze
to help unwind myself.

58:07.110 --> 58:09.320
It's not good
for your blood pressure.

58:09.404 --> 58:11.114
You worry too much.

58:12.907 --> 58:14.742
What are you smiling at?
You two are funny.

58:14.826 --> 58:16.161
Ahem. Cheers, Daddy.

58:16.244 --> 58:17.453

58:17.912 --> 58:19.998
Also, Frank, there's
someone here to see you.

58:20.081 --> 58:24.043

You remember me.

58:38.391 --> 58:39.851
I don't buy your whole act.

58:39.934 --> 58:41.811
Excuse me? Who are you?

58:42.395 --> 58:43.897
What is this about?

58:43.980 --> 58:47.817
Are you aware that your neighbor up the
lane here was recently burglarized?

58:47.901 --> 58:49.277
No. What neighbor?

Frank Weld, right?

58:55.783 --> 58:56.910
Guilty as charged.

58:57.869 --> 59:00.288
I think I read about
you at the academy.

59:00.371 --> 59:01.915
Come on, that is ridiculous.

59:01.998 --> 59:05.168
The police have been hassling
him for his entire life

59:05.251 --> 59:07.378
about a few mistakes
he made when he was a kid.

59:07.462 --> 59:09.380
Ma'am, you misunderstand me.

59:09.464 --> 59:12.383
The computer thinks Frank's
a suspect, of course.

59:12.467 --> 59:13.718
I don't mean any disrespect.

59:13.801 --> 59:16.763
I can't see him pulling a job
like this off at his age. Sorry.

My memory

I'm not a real person.

You don't need to apologize.
