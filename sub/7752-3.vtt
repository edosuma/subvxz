It was right there.
In my rosebushes.

00:03.820 --> 00:05.576
- What?
- A leg.

00:05.611 --> 00:07.604
What strikes your
fancy, darling?

00:07.639 --> 00:10.138
Handcuffs? Whips?
Ball gag?

00:12.075 --> 00:13.175
I'm pregnant.

00:14.043 --> 00:16.044
It's Pablo's baby.

00:16.079 --> 00:19.181
I just keep wondering how
I'm gonna tell Javi about this.

00:19.215 --> 00:20.649
Well, maybe you don't.

00:20.683 --> 00:23.885
[Sighs]
Zoila, will you marry me?

00:23.920 --> 00:25.520
Now that my book is done,

00:25.555 --> 00:27.656
I've been thinking
about what's next...

00:27.690 --> 00:30.258
She's starting
a placement agency for maids.

00:30.293 --> 00:31.560
Please don't go.

00:31.594 --> 00:33.061
I have to, Sebastien.

00:33.096 --> 00:34.229
Hello, Evelyn.

00:34.263 --> 00:36.531
I see that you've met
our daughter.

00:36.566 --> 00:39.368
Katy has emotional problems.

00:39.402 --> 00:42.371
- Hi.
- Oh, G-God! Blanca.

00:42.405 --> 00:43.739
What's wrong?

00:43.773 --> 00:45.173
Uh, there's a mess
in the living room.

00:45.208 --> 00:46.775
I was just going
to clean it up.

00:46.809 --> 00:49.077
What the hell happened in here?

00:49.112 --> 00:50.345
Well, at least call
Mr. Stappord,

00:50.380 --> 00:51.747
so he'll come home
from his trip.

00:51.781 --> 00:55.083
Michael? No. No.
I-I don't want to upset him.

00:55.118 --> 00:56.852
Listen, I'm not Ernesto.

00:56.886 --> 00:59.588
It's not fair that you keep
comparing me to a dead man.

00:59.622 --> 01:00.789
Ernesto Falta,
what's the purpose

01:00.823 --> 01:02.024
of your visit to America?

01:02.058 --> 01:04.226
I'm here to see my wife.

Well, hello.
How can I help you?

01:15.238 --> 01:16.972
I'm looking for a woman.

01:17.006 --> 01:18.106
That's too bad.

01:18.141 --> 01:20.142
Rosie Falta.
I read she was here.

01:20.176 --> 01:21.810
Oh, you mean Rosie Westmore?

01:21.844 --> 01:24.913
Yes. Rosie Westmore.

01:24.947 --> 01:26.581
She was discharged last week.

01:26.616 --> 01:27.983
Do you know how to find her?

01:28.017 --> 01:29.785
We don't give out
personal information.

01:29.819 --> 01:31.219
Hospital rules.

01:31.254 --> 01:35.624
Please, it's very important.
I have to see her.

01:43.032 --> 01:46.435
Oh. Whoa, whoa. We got...
We got to slow down a bit.

01:46.469 --> 01:48.437
You were in a coma. The doctor
says that you're not ready.

01:48.471 --> 01:50.639
Yeah, but we never
got to "consommé" our marriage.

01:50.673 --> 01:53.075
[Chuckles] Hmm?

01:53.109 --> 01:56.078
We have our whole lives
to... consommé...

01:56.112 --> 01:59.514
- once you've recovered.
- No. You're no fun.

01:59.549 --> 02:01.183
Mm.
[Cellphone ringing]

02:01.217 --> 02:03.819
Can you get that?

02:03.853 --> 02:05.253
[Sighs]

02:05.288 --> 02:07.656
I'm going to wash up.
Mm.

02:07.690 --> 02:11.293
Mm-mm!

02:11.327 --> 02:13.095
[Beep] [Sighs] Hello?

02:13.129 --> 02:15.297
Hey, it's Jerry
from Doheny Medical.

02:15.331 --> 02:17.532
Oh. Uh, hi, Jerry.
What's going on?

02:17.567 --> 02:20.368
There's a man here
looking for Rosie.

02:20.403 --> 02:21.703
He knows her from Mexico.

02:21.737 --> 02:23.004
Mexico?

02:23.039 --> 02:24.539
Yeah.
His name is Ernesto.

02:24.574 --> 02:27.175
- What?
- Ernesto.

02:27.210 --> 02:29.111
He says it's urgent.
Can I give you his number?

02:29.145 --> 02:31.713
Look, I don't know
what kind of sick joke this is,

02:31.748 --> 02:35.317
but Ernesto was Rosie's
first husband, and he's dead.

02:35.351 --> 02:37.119
Oh, God.

02:37.153 --> 02:38.520
So you tell whoever this guy is

02:38.554 --> 02:40.288
that Rosie
does not want to see him.

02:40.323 --> 02:42.824
Ever. Okay?

02:42.859 --> 02:45.060
I will. I'm sorry.

02:45.094 --> 02:47.896
[Beep]

02:47.930 --> 02:49.297

It was nothing.

02:55.104 --> 02:57.038

Everything is perfect.

Genevieve, Zoila and I
have something to ask you.

03:19.710 --> 03:21.277
What is it?

03:21.311 --> 03:22.845
We'd like you to be
the witness at our wedding.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.082
- Me? Your maid of honor?
- Witness.

03:26.116 --> 03:29.652
Well, I guess I can do both.
Have you set a date?

03:29.686 --> 03:31.421
Uh-huh. Friday.

03:31.455 --> 03:33.022
- What?
- I have to get back

03:33.057 --> 03:34.690
to my restaurant in Vegas
by the weekend.

03:34.725 --> 03:37.126
And since Valentina and Remi
are already in New York,

03:37.161 --> 03:39.796
we figured we'd rush down to
City Hall and get it over with.

03:39.830 --> 03:42.198
- Get it over with?
- Oh, no, no.

03:42.232 --> 03:44.200
That's not how
my Zoila gets married.

03:44.234 --> 03:46.202
Yes, it is.

03:46.236 --> 03:47.470
Why don't we have
the wedding here?

03:47.504 --> 03:49.672
Well, it's very kind
of you to offer.

03:49.706 --> 03:51.307
We don't want to make
a big deal about it.

03:51.341 --> 03:54.644
But you simply must have
a proper wedding.

03:54.678 --> 03:57.046
It's a celebration
of your lifelong commitment.

03:57.081 --> 03:59.382
That's why
I've had five of them.

03:59.416 --> 04:01.317
Really, Genevieve, we're happy
with our plan. Right, Javi?

04:01.351 --> 04:04.287
Well, it would be nice
to celebrate with our friends.

04:04.321 --> 04:06.889
See? Javi knows
how important it is,

04:06.924 --> 04:09.125
and he's never even
been married before.

04:09.159 --> 04:11.961
Uh, it's okay.
We'll do whatever Zoila wants.

04:11.995 --> 04:14.797
What do you say, Zoila?
Will you let me do this?

04:14.832 --> 04:16.699
As my wedding gift to you both?

04:16.733 --> 04:20.336
Do you really think you can
plan a wedding in three days?

04:20.370 --> 04:23.406
Absolutely.
I'll just keep it simple.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.241
Food, drinks, music...

04:25.275 --> 04:26.876
Okay.
We'll have it here.

a few doves.

04:29.746 --> 04:31.380
Maybe some fireworks.

04:31.415 --> 04:33.683
But nothing over the top,
I promise.

04:33.717 --> 04:35.952
We're having a wedding!

Everything all right?

05:02.579 --> 05:04.380
She had another nightmare.

I don't know
what's gotten into her.

05:07.618 --> 05:10.019

these paintings...

I mean,
what else could they be about?

05:27.571 --> 05:29.739
I don't know.
I'll, uh, talk to her.

05:32.009 --> 05:33.609
When does Mr. Stappord
come home?

05:33.644 --> 05:35.611
- Why?
- Well, his daughter's really scared.

05:35.646 --> 05:36.913
He should see these paintings.

05:36.947 --> 05:39.315
Well, I'll be sure to show him.

05:39.349 --> 05:41.717
It's, um...

05:41.752 --> 05:44.754
It's very sweet of you
to be concerned.

05:48.959 --> 05:51.928
Marisol, I am at my wit's end
with this maid you sent me.

05:51.962 --> 05:53.629
I am so sorry to hear that.

05:53.664 --> 05:55.831
What seems to be
the trouble... today?

05:55.866 --> 05:58.134
You know what?
I'll show you.

05:58.168 --> 05:59.835
- No, that's not...
- Lina!

05:59.870 --> 06:01.470
- Necessary.
- It's no trouble.

06:01.505 --> 06:03.105
Yes, Mrs. Fleming?

06:03.140 --> 06:04.974
Uh, hi.
It's very hot outside.

06:05.008 --> 06:07.009
Would you please water
the bougainvillea out back?

06:07.044 --> 06:08.911
Oh, right away.

- Mm-hmm. Bye, now.
- I mean...

06:21.959 --> 06:24.193
What?
She seems friendly to me.

06:24.228 --> 06:26.028
[Door opens, closes]
Exactly. She's <i> too</i> friendly.

endless chitchat with my maid.

06:29.566 --> 06:30.967
Okay, I will talk to her

06:31.001 --> 06:32.835
and tell her
no more pesky questions.

06:32.869 --> 06:34.170
Like, "How are you?"

06:34.204 --> 06:36.372
No, 'cause then
I'll seem like a bitch.

06:36.406 --> 06:37.640
And I'm not a bitch.

06:37.674 --> 06:38.941
Of course not.

06:38.976 --> 06:40.810
It's just,
she makes me uncomfortable.

06:40.844 --> 06:43.012
And I really need to feel
comfortable in my own home.

06:43.046 --> 06:44.480
So you'll send me someone else?

06:44.514 --> 06:45.881
It's just...
[Sighs]

06:45.916 --> 06:47.783
Lina's the third maid
you've rejected.

06:47.818 --> 06:49.919
So?

06:49.953 --> 06:54.156
So... maybe the problem
isn't the maids.

06:55.392 --> 06:57.994
Oh, I hope you're not saying
the problem is <i> me.</i>

06:58.028 --> 06:59.629
[Chuckling]
No, I would never just...

06:59.663 --> 07:01.464
come right out and say that.

07:01.498 --> 07:04.667
The thing is,
I can't keep sending you maids

07:04.701 --> 07:06.636
if you haven't paid
for any of their work.

07:06.670 --> 07:08.504
- I'll pay you.
- When?

07:08.538 --> 07:10.673
When you find me someone I like.

Oh, but wouldn't you rather
be <i> under</i> me?

07:35.065 --> 07:37.233
- I'm hanging up.
- No, no. Please.

07:37.267 --> 07:40.603
Uh, look, I miss you so much.
I'm going crazy.

07:40.637 --> 07:43.039
- Do you miss me?
- Of course.

07:43.073 --> 07:44.874
You know, but I don't trust
myself around you.

07:44.908 --> 07:46.876

who I am and what I want and...

- You got a job?
- Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.

all about your boy troubles

perhaps never.

to be kept spotless

to get all the way up there?

I don't care how the sausage
gets made, just that it does.

to have a sparkling repartee.

08:24.981 --> 08:29.819
Adrian, come meet the new maid.
This is Carmen.

08:29.853 --> 08:31.120
Nice to meet you.

08:31.154 --> 08:33.389
Has Evelyn broken
your spirit yet?

No.

08:34.524 --> 08:36.592
Well, give it time.

08:36.626 --> 08:37.993
Adrian, I've informed Carmen

08:38.028 --> 08:40.229
that she is here
on a trial basis only.

08:40.263 --> 08:42.231
I promise
I won't disappoint you.

08:42.265 --> 08:44.734
Good. It's important
to keep a beautiful home.

08:44.768 --> 08:47.336

image to our neighbors.

09:25.010 --> 09:28.180
Zoila, get out here.
[All gasp]

09:29.127 --> 09:31.128
Oh, my God!

09:31.162 --> 09:34.765
Knock it off.
I've tried on 10 dresses.

09:34.799 --> 09:37.601
You "ooh" and "ahh" at all of them.
You're a bunch of big fat liars.

09:37.635 --> 09:39.102
Well, I love it.

09:39.137 --> 09:40.504
And I'm not just saying
that because you're yelling.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.006
[Speaks Spanish]

09:43.041 --> 09:44.908
I can't believe you're getting
married tomorrow.

09:44.942 --> 09:47.177
I know.
It's happening so fast.

09:47.211 --> 09:49.012
Will Javi love it?

09:49.047 --> 09:51.682
In that dress? He'd marry you
even if you weren't pregnant.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.849
[Laughs]

09:52.884 --> 09:55.685
Sold.
Rosie, help me out of it?

09:55.720 --> 09:59.322
You know, this wedding
seems kind of fancy.

09:59.357 --> 10:00.757
I feel like I'm gonna stick out

10:00.792 --> 10:02.492
like a sore thumb
in my ugly dress.

10:02.527 --> 10:04.194
You can borrow one of mine.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.463
Weren't you listening?
She already has something ugly.

10:06.497 --> 10:08.665
Carmen! She wants to look hot.
You know, that's my thing.

10:08.700 --> 10:11.301
Your thing is...
something else.

10:11.335 --> 10:13.103
Why am I even friends with you?

10:13.137 --> 10:14.971
Come by later, okay?
You can try it on.

10:15.006 --> 10:16.606
Thank you, Carmen.

10:16.641 --> 10:17.941
Oh, and I think
I may have found a new family

10:17.975 --> 10:21.611
- for you to work for.
- No. No. Uh, that's fine.

10:21.646 --> 10:25.215
Mrs. Stappord and I worked
everything out, so we're fine.

10:25.249 --> 10:28.218
Because you just...
You don't seem fine.

10:28.252 --> 10:33.156
Really? 'Cause it was all
just one big misunderstanding.

10:33.191 --> 10:34.624
[Chuckles nervously] But you
know what? I got to get going.

10:34.659 --> 10:36.026
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

10:36.060 --> 10:37.828
Bye.

10:39.897 --> 10:42.299
Ugh.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.501
What?

10:44.535 --> 10:45.702
How pregnant are you?

10:45.737 --> 10:47.471
Two months and change.

10:47.505 --> 10:49.206
How much change?

10:49.240 --> 10:50.807
You think I look bigger?

10:50.842 --> 10:53.977
Well, I'd guess
about f-four months.

10:54.011 --> 10:55.312
Or maybe five.
[Scoffs]

10:55.346 --> 10:56.913
I am definitely
not that far along.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.448
Oh, of course not.

10:58.483 --> 11:01.651
That would mean you got pregnant
before the shooting.

11:01.686 --> 11:03.854
You know what?
I think I got it from here.

11:03.888 --> 11:05.555
Wait a second!

11:05.590 --> 11:09.092
Didn't you sleep with Pablo
right before he died?

11:09.127 --> 11:11.428
[Gasps] You say one word, and I
will put you back in a coma.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.331
Oh, my God!
It's Pablo's baby?!

11:14.365 --> 11:16.733
Yes! Okay?

11:16.768 --> 11:18.735
And I didn't want Javi
to figure it out,

11:18.770 --> 11:20.437
so I fudged the math a bit.

11:20.471 --> 11:24.107
You know I love you, cariña,
but you are playing with fire.

11:24.142 --> 11:28.378
I know!
But Javi was so excited.

11:28.412 --> 11:29.913
And this way,
the baby gets a father.

11:29.947 --> 11:33.316
- It really is for the best.
- Oh,<i> mija.</i>

11:33.351 --> 11:37.254
Who are you trying to convince?
Me or you?

11:40.258 --> 11:42.225
Very well.
See you this afternoon.

11:42.260 --> 11:43.660
[Beep]

11:43.695 --> 11:45.762
I just hired
a real-estate agent.

11:45.797 --> 11:47.598
He's never sold
a "murder house" before,

11:47.632 --> 11:49.700
but he is in escrow
on a "suicide condo."

11:49.734 --> 11:51.702
- That sounds promising.
- I agree.

11:51.736 --> 11:53.355
So, you're on board with
selling our home?

11:53.390 --> 11:57.507
Of course. But in return,
I'd like something from you.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.042
Oh, God.

11:59.077 --> 12:00.777
You don't want me to go to
that sex club again, do you?

12:00.812 --> 12:03.039
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I threw you into the deep

12:03.074 --> 12:04.514
- end with that.
- Good.

12:04.549 --> 12:07.584
I thought we should start
with something simple.

12:07.619 --> 12:10.020
- What is that?
- A toy.

12:10.054 --> 12:13.023
I thought we might get into
some light torture play

12:13.057 --> 12:14.725
in the comfort and privacy
of our home.

12:14.759 --> 12:16.460
What makes you think
I would ever agree to that?

12:16.494 --> 12:18.462
I'm selling
my beloved estate for you.

12:18.496 --> 12:21.398
I scratch your back, you...

12:21.432 --> 12:23.433
[Whip cracks]
...whip mine.

12:23.468 --> 12:26.436
Adrian, it is bad enough
that our home is a murder house.

12:26.471 --> 12:29.373
I won't let you turn it
into a sex dungeon, as well.

12:29.407 --> 12:31.775
When you said that, you sounded
just like your mother.

12:31.809 --> 12:33.443
[Gasps]

12:33.478 --> 12:36.413
Still not hitting you.

12:36.447 --> 12:39.149
But good effort.

12:43.855 --> 12:46.657
Don't worry, Lina. I will
find you another job, I promise.

12:46.691 --> 12:49.760
Marisol, I have never
been fired before.

12:49.794 --> 12:52.663
I know. It's not you.
It's Gail. She's...

12:52.697 --> 12:53.831
The devil?

12:53.865 --> 12:55.666
Well, I was going to say
"difficult."

12:55.700 --> 12:57.501
But yeah, she's the devil.

12:57.536 --> 12:59.136
[Sighs]
I will be in touch, okay?

12:59.171 --> 13:00.771
[Sniffles]
Okay. Thank you.

13:00.805 --> 13:02.339
All right.

13:04.109 --> 13:06.911
Okay.

13:06.945 --> 13:09.113
Jesse?

13:09.147 --> 13:11.582
That's me.
Jesse Morgan.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.684
Oh. You're a man.

13:13.718 --> 13:16.120
Thank you for noticing.
[Chuckles]

13:16.154 --> 13:19.156
No, it's just this is
a placement agency for maids.

13:19.191 --> 13:20.824
No, I know.
I filled out your application.

13:22.327 --> 13:24.495
- Is this a joke?
- No, ma'am.

13:24.529 --> 13:25.930
I like to clean,
and I'm good at it.

13:25.964 --> 13:28.499
Yes, but why would a man
want to be a maid?

13:28.533 --> 13:30.334
Why would a woman
want to run a business

13:30.368 --> 13:32.770
instead of stay home
and cook for a husband?

13:32.804 --> 13:34.805
- Um, do you see what I did there?
- Yes.

13:34.839 --> 13:36.640
- I flipped it around.
- I know.

13:36.675 --> 13:39.043
Look, I'm sorry,
but I founded this business

13:39.077 --> 13:41.045
to help disenfranchised <i> women.</i>

13:41.079 --> 13:43.881
So no boys allowed, huh?

13:43.915 --> 13:45.783
That's kind of sexist.

13:45.817 --> 13:49.186
Thank you so much
for coming in.

13:49.221 --> 13:50.554
You... [Scoffs]

13:50.589 --> 13:52.022
You're rejecting me
because I'm a man?

13:52.057 --> 13:55.459
No. I'm rejecting you
because you're rude.

13:55.493 --> 13:56.694
But have a good day.

13:59.331 --> 14:01.565
[Sighs]

14:05.537 --> 14:07.905
[Sniffling]

14:07.939 --> 14:09.540
[Knock on window]

14:09.574 --> 14:10.708
[Sighs]

14:12.744 --> 14:15.713
Hi. I saw you inside.
[Sighs]

14:15.747 --> 14:17.381
No, I...
I couldn't help but hear

14:17.415 --> 14:19.383
about that mean lady
that you worked for.

14:19.417 --> 14:21.151
She's horrible.

14:21.186 --> 14:22.953
Oh, I'll bet.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.422
Can you tell me
where she lives?

14:28.860 --> 14:32.062
[Door opens]

14:34.699 --> 14:36.500
Spence?

14:39.638 --> 14:42.840
That's my memory box.
What are you doing with it?

14:42.874 --> 14:44.675
Just looking for my cuff links.

14:44.709 --> 14:47.077
They're in the night stand.

14:48.913 --> 14:52.516
So, uh...
that's Ernesto.

14:52.550 --> 14:56.887
Mm-hmm.
Just like I remember him.

14:56.921 --> 14:59.757
[Chuckles] We were so in love.

15:01.826 --> 15:03.060
Sorry.

15:03.094 --> 15:05.396
No. You do not
have to apologize.

15:05.430 --> 15:09.199
I have been very blessed...

15:09.234 --> 15:13.404
to have had two great loves.

15:19.644 --> 15:22.813
So, Ernesto, that...
that must be a common name, huh?

15:22.847 --> 15:24.748
Yeah, I guess.

15:24.783 --> 15:26.550
I mean, you must have known
a lot of Ernestos in Mexico.

15:26.584 --> 15:28.886
Hmm, no.
Just the one.

15:30.588 --> 15:34.992
I remember the day he died.

15:36.795 --> 15:41.432
I was making dinner when
<i>la policía</i> knocked on my door.

15:43.768 --> 15:46.401
They told me
Ernesto was dead...

15:46.771 --> 15:49.773
killed by a drug cartel.

15:49.808 --> 15:52.176
Yeah, that must have been
so hard.

15:52.210 --> 15:53.877
Having to bury
your own husband.

15:53.912 --> 15:58.015
That was the worst part.
I couldn't bury him.

15:59.684 --> 16:00.851
What?

16:00.885 --> 16:02.853
His body was never found.

16:04.856 --> 16:07.291
[Sighs, sniffles]

16:12.964 --> 16:15.766
[Doorbell rings]

16:20.472 --> 16:23.374
- Sebastien?
- Carmen?

16:23.408 --> 16:26.343
What the hell are you doing here?
Are you stalking me now?

16:26.378 --> 16:28.379
No, no, no, no. I-I-I'm not here
for you. I swear.

16:28.413 --> 16:29.980
How many times
do I have to tell you?

16:30.014 --> 16:31.315
I don't want you in my life!

16:31.349 --> 16:34.118
Carmen,
is that my Realtor?

16:34.152 --> 16:37.187
Oh, God. No.

16:37.222 --> 16:39.390
No. No!

16:39.424 --> 16:41.492
I told you
I wasn't here for you.

16:41.526 --> 16:43.193
You must be Sebastien.
I'm Evelyn Powell.

16:43.228 --> 16:44.628
<i>Enchanté.</i>

16:44.662 --> 16:46.397
Well, aren't you a charmer?
[Chuckles]

16:46.431 --> 16:48.832
I'm very much looking forward
to selling your house.

16:48.867 --> 16:50.534
Please come in.

16:50.568 --> 16:53.036
If you need anything at all,
Carmen is at your service.

16:53.071 --> 16:56.306
I'll remember that.

17:21.866 --> 17:24.034
Hey, Katy.

17:24.068 --> 17:26.203
I wanted to talk to you
about your pictures.

17:26.237 --> 17:28.772
Can you tell me about them?

17:37.215 --> 17:38.749
What about this one?

17:38.783 --> 17:41.919
Is that you, Katy?

17:44.389 --> 17:47.791
Okay. [Sighs]
Why do you have a knife?

17:59.771 --> 18:02.139
[Sighs]

18:02.173 --> 18:03.974
Don't be scared.

18:04.008 --> 18:05.442
I just want to know
what happened.

18:07.912 --> 18:12.382
What about this man?
He looks dead.

18:12.417 --> 18:13.951
Who is he?

18:16.187 --> 18:18.121
That's my daddy.

18:33.183 --> 18:35.984
Zoila!
I have the most wonderful news.

18:36.019 --> 18:37.886
I found the caterer
for our wedding.

18:37.921 --> 18:40.022
<i>My</i> wedding.
It's my wedding.

18:40.056 --> 18:43.225
Yes, of course.
Your special day. All about you.

18:43.259 --> 18:44.727
Anyway, meet Joelle.

18:44.761 --> 18:47.930
You must be the bride!
Congratulations.

18:47.964 --> 18:50.766
Joelle was available
at the last minute,

18:50.800 --> 18:52.534
and her crab cakes
are to die for.

18:52.569 --> 18:54.169
[Laughs] I'm sure you're great,

18:54.204 --> 18:56.572
but I can't hire a caterer
without my fiancé.

18:56.606 --> 18:57.740
He's a chef.

18:57.774 --> 18:59.508
Oh.
That's the best part.

18:59.542 --> 19:02.211
Joelle used to be the sous chef
at Javier's restaurant,

19:02.245 --> 19:03.679
so you know he'll approve.

19:03.713 --> 19:06.715
Wait, are you talking
about Javier Mendoza?

19:06.750 --> 19:09.118
Mm-hmm.
He's the groom.

19:09.152 --> 19:11.553
Oh, wow.
I didn't realize.

19:11.588 --> 19:13.789
You know, you should probably
hire someone else.

19:13.823 --> 19:17.726
What? Why?
I'd rather not get into it.

19:17.761 --> 19:19.728
What? Did you have a problem
with Javi?

19:19.763 --> 19:23.132
Not at all.
We got along very, very well.

19:23.166 --> 19:25.868
Well, what then?

19:25.902 --> 19:28.237
I'm his ex-wife.

19:29.572 --> 19:32.374
[Laughs] No.
Javi's never been married.

19:32.409 --> 19:35.310
He didn't tell you.
God, this is awkward.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.312
[Sighs] I should go.

19:37.347 --> 19:41.583
I don't suppose
you could leave the crab cakes?

19:41.618 --> 19:44.586
[Ringing]

19:44.621 --> 19:46.321
- Hello?
- Hi, Gail.

19:46.356 --> 19:48.924
- Hey, Marisol. How are you?
- Good.

19:48.958 --> 19:50.559
Listen, I think I may have found
another housekeeper for you.

19:50.593 --> 19:53.395
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, he's here now.

19:53.430 --> 19:55.397
- Who is?
- The man you sent.

19:55.432 --> 19:57.099
Jesse.

19:58.668 --> 20:02.271
I'll be right there.

20:02.305 --> 20:04.006
[Doorbell rings]

20:06.376 --> 20:08.944
What do you think you're doing?

20:08.978 --> 20:10.746
At the moment, I'm dusting.

20:10.780 --> 20:13.282
I did not send you here. You do
<i>not</i> represent my business.

20:13.316 --> 20:16.118
- Let me explain.
- No! You can get your things

20:16.152 --> 20:17.953
and get out
before I call the police.

20:17.987 --> 20:20.422
Marisol, I have a bone
to pick with you.

20:20.457 --> 20:22.858
I know.
I am sorry.

20:22.892 --> 20:24.860
You should be.

20:24.894 --> 20:27.029
Where have you been hiding
this one?

20:27.063 --> 20:28.931
Huh?

20:28.965 --> 20:30.332
How come you sent me
all of those duds

20:30.366 --> 20:33.535
when you had the perfect maid
all along?

20:33.570 --> 20:35.037
Jesse is the perfect maid?

20:35.071 --> 20:36.638
Oh, yeah.
He's a godsend.

20:36.673 --> 20:38.040
He's hardworking, polite,

20:38.074 --> 20:40.042

I'm having.

there were male maids.

in my own home.

20:44.647 --> 20:46.215
Well, you know what?
It was Marisol's idea.

20:46.249 --> 20:48.283
<i>She</i> is a genius.

20:48.318 --> 20:52.120
[Clears throat] Well, guess it's
about time I wrote you that check.

20:52.155 --> 20:54.523
Yeah. Uh, Gail, there is
something that you should know.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.959
And to think, if you had
screwed up one more time,

20:56.993 --> 20:59.928
I was gonna badmouth
your business all over town.

20:59.963 --> 21:02.965
It's Marisol
with one "L."

21:07.937 --> 21:09.505
That's him all right.

21:09.539 --> 21:11.206
That's the Ernesto
who was here?

21:12.208 --> 21:14.376
- You're sure?
- Positive.

21:14.410 --> 21:17.246
I would never forget a face
like that. Very handsome.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.347
Thank you, Jerry.

21:18.381 --> 21:20.482
- <i>Muy guapo.</i>
- I got it.

21:20.517 --> 21:22.751
You said that he left his
number. Do you still have it?

[Sighs] Sebastien!

21:31.694 --> 21:34.062
You scared me half to death.
How did you get in here?

21:34.097 --> 21:36.832
Evelyn gave me a key.
I can come by anytime now.

21:36.866 --> 21:38.233
They're not home.

21:38.268 --> 21:40.102
I know.

21:40.136 --> 21:43.338
This is crazy.
You can't be their Realtor.

21:43.373 --> 21:45.941
You have to quit.

21:45.975 --> 21:47.476
But it's fate.

21:47.510 --> 21:50.279
In all the houses in
Beverly Hills, I get hired here.

21:50.313 --> 21:52.714
Doesn't that mean anything
to you?

21:52.749 --> 21:55.117
It means you're desperate enough
to list a murder house,

21:55.151 --> 21:57.753
and I'm desperate
enough to clean one.

21:57.787 --> 21:59.021
I know why you're upset.

21:59.055 --> 22:02.224
You're afraid
you cannot resist me.

22:02.258 --> 22:04.626
Sebastien...

22:04.661 --> 22:07.462
Do you remember
how it was between us?

22:07.497 --> 22:09.298
The heat.

22:09.332 --> 22:10.732
The passion.

22:10.767 --> 22:11.934
Mm.

22:11.968 --> 22:13.769
The ecstasy.

22:13.803 --> 22:16.772
Oh, stop talking.
You're confusing me.

22:16.806 --> 22:20.575
I need you, Carmen.
Just like you need me.

22:20.610 --> 22:23.378
[Sighs] Oh, son of a bitch.

22:28.751 --> 22:31.920
Did you see the way
the maítre d' looked at us?

22:31.955 --> 22:35.324
He'd obviously heard
about the leg.

22:35.358 --> 22:37.960
I'm in the mood for a nightcap.
Care to join me?

22:37.994 --> 22:39.761
Oh, I had a Valium for dessert.

22:39.796 --> 22:42.230
Alcohol would just be
gilding the lily.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.441
[Gasps] Did you hear that?

22:52.475 --> 22:53.508
Hear what?

22:53.543 --> 22:54.910

[Door closes]

22:54.944 --> 22:56.111
Oh, my God, the door!

23:04.120 --> 23:05.687
Carmen?
Are you in there?

23:05.722 --> 23:07.522
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's me.

23:07.557 --> 23:09.691
I-I'm... cleaning!

23:09.726 --> 23:11.126
Well, I need a drink.

23:11.160 --> 23:14.096
Come back later.
It's... it's... it's...

23:14.130 --> 23:15.297

[Clears throat]

23:42.158 --> 23:44.326
This is all your fault!

23:44.360 --> 23:45.827
I'm probably getting fired now!

23:45.862 --> 23:47.863
So, we're not gonna finish?

23:47.897 --> 23:49.464
Get out!

23:49.499 --> 23:50.899
[Sighs]

23:57.573 --> 23:59.841
Where did you find these?

23:59.876 --> 24:01.510
In the trash.

24:01.544 --> 24:03.378
You know, I wasn't sure
why you'd thrown them away.

24:03.413 --> 24:05.147
And then I talked to Katy.

24:05.181 --> 24:07.549
She told me the truth about
what really happened that night,

24:07.583 --> 24:09.418
and it's all right here
in her paintings.

24:09.452 --> 24:10.986
Blanca, the...
[Sighs]

24:11.020 --> 24:13.088
These aren't about anything.
It's just her imagination.

24:13.122 --> 24:14.589
I don't think so.

24:14.624 --> 24:16.591
I think you're covering up
for what she did.

24:16.626 --> 24:18.827
- What?
- I know that you love her.

24:18.861 --> 24:21.229
But if she is capable
of doing something like this,

24:21.264 --> 24:23.098
then she needs help.

24:23.132 --> 24:25.934
Well, okay,
Katy didn't do anything.

24:25.968 --> 24:27.369
She's just a sweet little girl.

24:27.403 --> 24:29.237
She killed your husband.

24:29.272 --> 24:31.106
That's why you won't go
to the police.

24:31.140 --> 24:32.841
You're protecting
your daughter.

24:34.444 --> 24:36.044
You know, Blanca,

24:36.079 --> 24:37.879
you're starting to sound
a little crazy.

24:37.914 --> 24:41.249
No.
No, I'm not crazy.

24:41.284 --> 24:43.752
I know that Mr. Stappord
is dead.

24:46.255 --> 24:47.422
Michael?

24:47.457 --> 24:48.957
Yeah?

24:52.628 --> 24:55.263
Hey, Blanca.
[Sighs]

24:55.298 --> 24:57.432
- Something wrong?
- She's just surprised to see you.

24:57.467 --> 24:58.967
She didn't know
that you'd come home.

24:59.001 --> 25:01.002
Oh.

25:15.228 --> 25:17.789
Mr. Powell,
I didn't mean to hurt you.

25:17.828 --> 25:18.895
I am so sorry.

25:18.929 --> 25:21.331
<i>I should be</i> apologizing.

25:21.365 --> 25:24.367
You said I shouldn't come in,
and I disobeyed your order.

25:24.401 --> 25:27.904
Oh, it w-wasn't really an order.
More of a suggestion.

25:27.938 --> 25:32.342
No, I needed to be punished
for my insubordination.

25:32.376 --> 25:34.544
So you're not firing me?

25:34.578 --> 25:37.680
Not at all.
Your trial period is over.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.451
Keep up the good work.

25:43.754 --> 25:45.922
Do I have your permission
to leave?

25:47.324 --> 25:48.324
Sure?

25:55.332 --> 25:58.301
I can't believe Javi didn't
tell me about being married.

25:58.335 --> 26:00.737
Well,
maybe it slipped his mind.

26:00.771 --> 26:03.740
I know I can barely remember
all my husbands.

26:03.774 --> 26:06.142
Look, Javi's hiding something.
<i>I'm</i> hiding something.

26:06.176 --> 26:07.777
We should not
be getting married.

26:07.811 --> 26:09.779
Of course you should.

26:09.813 --> 26:12.181
Don't you understand?
Now you're even.

26:12.216 --> 26:13.616
What?

26:13.651 --> 26:16.252
For weeks you've been feeling
so guilty

26:16.287 --> 26:17.954
letting Javier believe
he's the father.

26:17.988 --> 26:19.255
So?

26:19.290 --> 26:22.458
So now he's given you
a loophole.

26:22.493 --> 26:25.261
As long as
he's keeping a secret, too,

26:25.296 --> 26:27.263
you're in the clear.

26:27.298 --> 26:29.866
Oh, my God!
That's sick!

26:29.900 --> 26:31.034
That's twisted.

26:32.169 --> 26:35.171
And kind of genius.

26:37.675 --> 26:40.443
That should cover
your work for the day.

26:40.477 --> 26:43.313
I kind of thought you were gonna
pay me at the end of the week.

26:43.347 --> 26:45.715
This is your end of the week.
I'm letting you go.

26:45.749 --> 26:47.684

loves me.

26:47.718 --> 26:51.321
Congratulations.

a part of it.

I'm not up to anything.

I can do this job.

26:57.695 --> 27:00.396
Yeah? Well,
I still don't trust you.

27:00.431 --> 27:03.366
You just don't believe that
a man would <i> want</i> to be a maid.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.568
Yeah, fine, I'm sexist.
You got me.

that came back.

27:38.902 --> 27:41.137
Oh, my God.

All I want is to work in a place
that's quiet and calm,

think about

27:49.146 --> 27:50.947
all the messed-up stuff
that I saw.

27:52.616 --> 27:55.985

to ask from you.

27:56.020 --> 27:57.253
Wait.

28:01.425 --> 28:03.960
I'll give you another chance.

a <i> first</i> chance.

want to talk to your new boss?

Oh, thanks, Blanca.

So, you were in Boston
all this time?

28:20.911 --> 28:24.113
Yeah, my trip got extended.
Taylor didn't tell you?

28:24.148 --> 28:26.716
Oh, she's had
a lot on her mind.

28:28.752 --> 28:30.553
Anything I should know about?

28:30.587 --> 28:33.322
Well, there were some things
that happened

28:33.357 --> 28:34.724
while you were away.

28:34.758 --> 28:36.492
What kind of things?

28:36.527 --> 28:38.327
It has to do with Katy.

to run to the pharmacy.

a few things.

How are you not dead?

So, this whole time
the cartel was just

she was in a coma
for four months.

30:07.384 --> 30:08.885
Her condition
is really delicate.

30:08.919 --> 30:10.653
The hospital released her.

30:10.687 --> 30:12.989
Yeah, but the shock of seeing
you could send her right back.

I mean, my God,

how to tell her about you.

she will leave you.

Uh, let's go sign
the guest book.

31:57.815 --> 31:58.948
Excuse me.

31:58.983 --> 32:00.583
Yes.
[Chuckles] Yeah.

32:00.618 --> 32:02.352
Hi! Oh, tch, tch,
tch, tch, tch, tch.

32:02.386 --> 32:04.187
Mm-hmm.

32:04.221 --> 32:05.622
There.
That's better.

32:05.656 --> 32:07.023
Thanks.

32:07.057 --> 32:09.626
You seem kind of quiet.
Are you all right?

32:09.660 --> 32:12.262
I don't know.

32:12.296 --> 32:13.897
Something bad happened.

32:13.931 --> 32:15.231
With my dress?

32:15.266 --> 32:17.767
No, no.
At the Stappord's.

32:17.802 --> 32:19.235
Oh, honey, what is it?

32:19.270 --> 32:21.771
Not here.

32:21.805 --> 32:25.074
Come by after and you can
tell me all about it, okay?

32:25.109 --> 32:28.545
Okay. I will.
Thank you, Carmen.

32:28.579 --> 32:30.880
Mnh-mnh.
Red stains.

32:37.588 --> 32:39.422
Zoila?

32:39.456 --> 32:41.257
[Knock on door] Can I come in?

32:41.292 --> 32:44.093
Ay, Javi, you're not supposed to
see me before the wedding.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.162
It's tradition. But I need
to tell you something.

32:46.197 --> 32:47.463
Well, then,
tell me through the door.

32:47.498 --> 32:49.232
[Sighs]

32:49.266 --> 32:52.835
Remember when Genevieve said
this would be my first marriage?

32:52.870 --> 32:54.270
Well, it's been eating away
at me.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.772
I-I have to tell you
about my past.

32:55.806 --> 32:58.042
- No! No.
- Oh! What about tradition?

32:58.077 --> 33:00.426
[Scoffs] I'm wearing
a maternity wedding dress.

33:00.461 --> 33:01.594
Forget about tradition.

33:01.629 --> 33:04.414
[Sighs] Well,
what I was going to say I...

33:04.448 --> 33:05.815
Don't!

33:05.850 --> 33:08.017
I mean I love you.

33:08.052 --> 33:11.287
And I'm not the kind of wife
who needs to know everything.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.323
But we're starting a life together.
Isn't honesty a good thing?

33:13.357 --> 33:16.759
You know what else
is a good thing? Mystery.

33:16.794 --> 33:19.095
Zoila, I was married before.

33:19.129 --> 33:20.430
- No!
- Yes.

33:20.464 --> 33:22.999
I-I-I was young
and impulsive,

33:23.033 --> 33:24.701
and it only lasted
three months.

33:24.735 --> 33:28.705
[Sighs] I didn't tell you
because I was embarrassed.

33:28.739 --> 33:29.973
Are you angry?

33:30.007 --> 33:32.809
No.

33:34.311 --> 33:37.046
Don't worry about it, Javi.
We all have a past.

33:37.081 --> 33:39.883
[Sighs] Oh.
Such a relief.

33:39.917 --> 33:41.317
Feels good
to get that off my chest.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.920
I'll bet.

33:43.954 --> 33:45.788
Ahh.

34:01.672 --> 34:05.241
Hey. You made it.
How was the audition?

34:05.276 --> 34:06.342
Huh?

34:06.377 --> 34:08.311
The audition you went to?

34:08.344 --> 34:10.713
- [Chuckles] You okay?
- You're happy, right?

34:10.748 --> 34:11.880
With me?

34:11.915 --> 34:14.317
I'm very happy.

34:14.351 --> 34:16.185
I wouldn't want to be married
to anyone else.

34:16.219 --> 34:18.388
Good to know.

34:23.527 --> 34:27.429
[Wagner's "Bridal Chorus"
plays]

34:33.437 --> 34:36.606
Okay, sweetheart.
That's your cue.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.775
Javi just told me
he was married.

34:39.810 --> 34:41.043
What?

34:41.078 --> 34:42.679
He was so honest
and wonderful and...

34:42.713 --> 34:44.380
I don't know if I can do this.

34:44.415 --> 34:49.217
Now, you listen to me. You love
Javi, and Javi loves you.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.987
And I loved the $80,000
I spent on this wedding.

34:52.022 --> 34:54.023
Now go.

35:47.778 --> 35:51.581
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

35:51.615 --> 35:54.584
to celebrate the marriage
of Javier and Zoila.

35:54.618 --> 35:56.586
And as I look upon you now,

35:56.620 --> 35:58.621
I'm reminded marriage
is a sacred vow,

35:58.655 --> 36:01.457
built upon a foundation
of respect

36:01.492 --> 36:03.860
and, above all, honesty.

36:03.894 --> 36:07.697
Marriage is also
a public pledge of love

36:07.731 --> 36:11.701
and devotion everlasting
in the eyes of God.

36:11.735 --> 36:14.103
And with those principles
guiding us,

36:14.138 --> 36:19.130
I'd like to read to you
from Corinthians 13:4-8.

36:19.576 --> 36:23.379
"Love is patient, love is kind.

36:23.414 --> 36:26.469
It does not envy,
it does not boast,

36:26.504 --> 36:27.884
it is not proud.

36:27.918 --> 36:32.121
It is not rude,
it is not self-seeking,

36:32.156 --> 36:33.556
it is not easily angered.

36:33.590 --> 36:35.291
Love does not..."

36:36.427 --> 36:38.861
Rosie?

36:38.896 --> 36:41.364
[Gasps] Ernesto?

36:42.900 --> 36:44.700
Rosita.

36:46.570 --> 36:48.304
Oh, my!

36:48.338 --> 36:50.006
[Murmuring]

36:59.561 --> 37:00.728
You're Rosie's first husband?

37:00.762 --> 37:02.296
Aren't you supposed to be dead?

37:02.330 --> 37:04.531
I can explain if you would
just let me talk to her.

37:04.566 --> 37:06.834
Look, I'm kind of in the middle
of my wedding here.

37:06.868 --> 37:09.136
<i>Disculpame.</i>
But I need to see her.

37:09.170 --> 37:11.138
Ernesto, clearly,
you have been through a lot.

37:11.172 --> 37:13.974
But so has Rosie.
You need to give her some time.

37:14.009 --> 37:15.776
Why don't you leave us
your number?

37:15.810 --> 37:17.544
And she'll call you
when she's ready.

37:20.448 --> 37:23.250
[Clicking]

37:23.284 --> 37:25.352
She can reach me here.

37:25.387 --> 37:28.222
I'm... sorry again
for interrupting.

37:31.726 --> 37:34.328
Can you believe that?!
Poor Rosie.

37:34.362 --> 37:37.231
I don't know. For a dead guy,
he's really hot.

37:37.265 --> 37:39.566
I'm gonna go check on her.

37:39.601 --> 37:42.136
Yeah.

37:46.207 --> 37:49.543
Here.
How are you feeling?

37:50.216 --> 37:54.293
Ernesto... he's alive.

37:54.616 --> 37:56.517
How could he be alive?

37:56.551 --> 37:59.386
Rosie.
Hey, you need to rest.

37:59.421 --> 38:02.222
This doesn't make any sense.

38:02.257 --> 38:03.857
How did he even know
where to find me?

38:03.892 --> 38:07.261
He must have followed me.

38:07.295 --> 38:08.529
Damn it.

38:08.563 --> 38:10.531
What?

38:10.565 --> 38:13.367
[Sighs]

38:13.401 --> 38:14.802
I-I-I don't understand.

38:14.836 --> 38:16.970
That phone call the other night,
that was...

38:17.005 --> 38:18.272
that was the hospital.

38:18.306 --> 38:20.441
Ernesto was there
looking for you.

38:21.666 --> 38:26.413
You knew he was alive
and you did not tell me?

38:26.448 --> 38:27.748
Honey, I was worried about you.

38:27.782 --> 38:29.727
I was worried it would be too much
for you. And, look, I was right.

38:29.762 --> 38:32.953
You should have told me
the moment you found out.

38:32.987 --> 38:35.389
<i>I trusted you!</i>

38:35.423 --> 38:36.824
<i>I'm sorry.
That was wrong.</i>

38:36.858 --> 38:38.525
<i>But I swear, I thought
I was doing the right thing.</i>

38:38.560 --> 38:43.331
<i>You lied to me! How can you lie
to someone you love?!</i>

38:43.998 --> 38:45.799
Zoila?

38:45.834 --> 38:47.101
The minister has to leave soon.

38:47.135 --> 38:49.570
Are we ready to continue?

38:54.342 --> 38:56.944
We need to talk.

38:56.978 --> 38:59.813
What's so urgent it can't wait
till after the ceremony?

38:59.848 --> 39:02.816
Please, let me get this out.

39:02.851 --> 39:07.821
Javi, you're a wonderful man.

39:07.856 --> 39:10.290
The answer to a prayer
I didn't even know I made.

39:10.325 --> 39:14.094
Which makes this even harder.

39:14.128 --> 39:16.830
Zoila,<i> mi amor,</i> what is it?

39:20.034 --> 39:22.269
It's Pablo's baby, not yours.

39:26.508 --> 39:27.941
[Sighs]

39:31.045 --> 39:32.446
How long have you known?

39:34.215 --> 39:35.782
A while.

39:35.817 --> 39:40.621
I wanted to tell you before,
but I was scared.

39:41.218 --> 39:46.129
And I'm so, so sorry.

39:48.159 --> 39:51.198
I'm sorry, too.

39:51.232 --> 39:53.300
But marriage is about trust.

39:53.334 --> 39:56.303
- No. No.
- How could I ever trust you again?

39:56.337 --> 39:57.704
[Crying] No.

39:57.739 --> 39:58.872
No, Javi.

39:58.907 --> 40:00.574
No.

40:04.546 --> 40:05.546
Zoila?

40:13.354 --> 40:15.289
[Whimpers]

40:15.323 --> 40:17.925
[Crying]

40:22.864 --> 40:24.865
[Insects chirping]

40:31.272 --> 40:35.242
Mrs. Stappord?

40:35.276 --> 40:38.045
Mr. Stappord?

40:38.079 --> 40:39.079
[Floor creaks]

40:59.634 --> 41:02.803
[Floor creaks]

41:02.837 --> 41:04.605
Hello?

41:04.639 --> 41:07.074
Is someone there?
