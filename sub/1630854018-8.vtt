00:07.166 --> 00:08.875
Whose dagger was it, Galadriel?

00:08.958 --> 00:12.291
My brother.
He was killed by servants of Sauron.

00:13.333 --> 00:17.500
After Morgoth's defeat,
the one you call Sauron,

00:17.625 --> 00:22.666
he sought to craft a power
not of the flesh, but over flesh.

00:22.750 --> 00:25.416
I killed Sauron.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.541
I don't believe you.

00:26.625 --> 00:28.333
Á kuita!

00:29.583 --> 00:31.208
-Dilly, get back!

00:32.166 --> 00:33.625
-I'm all...

00:35.375 --> 00:39.500
But despite our every effort,
our decline has only quickened.

00:39.583 --> 00:42.125
This  mithril...
It is our only salvation.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.625
Nothing diminishes its light.

00:45.041 --> 00:46.541
-King Durin...
-Enough!

00:47.541 --> 00:51.791
I will not risk Dwarven lives
to help the Elves cheat death.

00:52.916 --> 00:54.541
I'm going to Middle-earth.

00:54.625 --> 00:58.250
All that awaits you there is darkness.

00:59.333 --> 01:00.166
Take shelter!

01:05.125 --> 01:06.500
Where is my son?

01:06.583 --> 01:08.625
Adar! Adar!

01:08.708 --> 01:11.375
Let us put this land
behind our sails.

01:11.708 --> 01:15.458
-Fighting at your side, I felt...
-I felt it, too.

01:17.375 --> 01:19.125
This wound needs Elvish medicine.

01:19.208 --> 01:20.791
Strength to the king!

01:25.375 --> 01:26.416
Where are you goin'?

01:26.500 --> 01:28.125
-Warn him what's comin'.
-Alone?

01:28.208 --> 01:29.875
She won't be alone.

02:20.916 --> 02:22.541
You're not a peril.

02:25.291 --> 02:26.625
You're good.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.083
Nori?

03:46.500 --> 03:48.916
We come to serve you,

03:49.833 --> 03:52.125
Lord Sauron.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.708
Gil-galad arrives tomorrow,

05:57.791 --> 06:01.125
expecting to be presented
with a means of saving all Elvendom.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.333
And we have none.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.750
If only there was some way...

06:08.583 --> 06:12.583
of doing more with less.

06:13.708 --> 06:18.708
The Sun itself began as something
no bigger than the palm of my hand.

06:18.791 --> 06:22.625
And how could we possibly
match the powers that wrought the Sun?

06:24.416 --> 06:26.541
We're out of time, Celebrimbor.

06:30.166 --> 06:32.666
We must inform the High King
of our failure.

06:34.125 --> 06:39.125
Then the Elves must prepare
to abandon these shores. Forever.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.583
Galadriel?

06:56.791 --> 06:57.875
Elrond.

06:58.416 --> 06:59.791
-What has happened?

07:00.750 --> 07:04.000
-Enemy lance. Six days ago.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.041
We rode without rest.

07:08.041 --> 07:09.458
Can you help him?

07:10.958 --> 07:14.416
Á tulë koivienna...

07:14.500 --> 07:16.750
King of the Southlands?

07:16.833 --> 07:19.125
How is it your path crossed with his?

07:19.875 --> 07:21.458
How is it you are here?

07:22.583 --> 07:24.083
How is it you are here?

07:28.791 --> 07:31.208
Come. We have much to discuss.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.750
I should never have set you on that ship.

07:41.416 --> 07:45.416
I should have trusted you.
It is a mistake I will not make again.

07:51.958 --> 07:53.791
I leapt from that ship...

07:56.166 --> 07:59.041
Because I believed in my heart
I was not yet worthy of it.

08:00.083 --> 08:04.083
I knew that, somehow,
my task here was not yet complete.

08:05.750 --> 08:08.958
And when I surfaced,
all I could do was swim,

08:09.833 --> 08:12.041
and pray I had chosen wisely.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.333
I did not cross that bitter ocean...

08:19.708 --> 08:21.291
Only to drown now.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.583
And nor will I let you.

08:33.041 --> 08:34.875
I have missed you.

08:38.333 --> 08:39.750
What are we to do?

08:42.750 --> 08:44.333
The only thing we can do.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.416
Swim.

08:56.958 --> 08:58.125
Who's there?

09:04.208 --> 09:06.208
Who's there? Reveal yourself.

09:07.208 --> 09:08.875
Is Galadriel here?

09:15.625 --> 09:16.833
No.

09:18.666 --> 09:21.166
Shouldn't you be resting?

09:21.708 --> 09:23.208
What is this place?

09:24.416 --> 09:28.291
This was the workshop of Celebrimbor.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.083
The Celebrimbor?

09:31.666 --> 09:33.666
-He's not here, is he?

09:33.750 --> 09:37.541
Well... As a matter of fact, he is.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.000
Celebrimbor...

09:53.166 --> 09:54.583
The master I apprenticed to

09:54.666 --> 09:57.166
used to speak of the wonders
of your craft.

09:58.125 --> 10:01.750
I never dreamed that I'd ever
get the chance to see them in person.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.041
Are you a smith?

10:03.750 --> 10:07.083
Well... Nothing like your artistry.

10:09.458 --> 10:13.458
These gemstones,
I've never seen anything like them.

10:14.291 --> 10:17.458
What do you plan to use them for?

10:17.541 --> 10:23.541
Fëanor's jewelcraft managed
to capture the essence of Valinor.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.250
I had hoped to do the same
for Middle-earth.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.291
This is a peculiar ore.

10:29.583 --> 10:30.875
What is it?

10:33.750 --> 10:34.833
Not enough.

10:34.916 --> 10:36.125
Enough for what?

10:40.375 --> 10:41.375
Please.

10:41.458 --> 10:45.541
Have you tried combining it
with other ores? To better stretch it out?

10:45.625 --> 10:47.958
That wouldn't be suitable for this ore.

10:48.041 --> 10:50.166
-Why not?
-Because in the amounts we need,

10:50.250 --> 10:53.125
it would too greatly dilute
its unique qualities.

10:53.708 --> 10:56.708
Forgive me, but, uh, at the risk
of sounding a fool,

10:56.791 --> 10:59.958
couldn't the right alloy
also amplify those qualities?

11:01.708 --> 11:03.791
Uh... Amplify?

11:03.875 --> 11:07.208
Where I came up, precious metals
were scarce as hens' teeth.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.291
-So we learnt to combine them

11:09.375 --> 11:11.875
to harness strengths and hide flaws.

11:11.958 --> 11:17.291
I've seen a trace of nickel added to iron
to make a blade lighter and stronger.

11:17.375 --> 11:22.375
Might there not be some alloy
to amplify the qualities of your ore?

11:29.791 --> 11:31.541
Well, that is...

11:33.666 --> 11:35.750
an intriguing suggestion.

11:37.833 --> 11:39.250
Call it...

11:40.791 --> 11:42.250
a gift.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.166
Soon, he will travel that road

11:51.250 --> 11:54.458
which makes an end of every man
who walks it.

11:55.291 --> 11:58.041
Black flags will fill our harbor.

11:59.458 --> 12:02.625
It will be our duty
to forge for him a tomb,

12:04.791 --> 12:07.416
granting him the immortality in stone

12:09.500 --> 12:10.875
that no man,

12:12.916 --> 12:16.333
not even a king, can attain in life.

12:17.708 --> 12:23.083
Draftsmen from across Númenor
have been summoned to capture his visage,

12:23.166 --> 12:25.166
so they can propose a design.

12:26.041 --> 12:27.875
Of all the apprentices,

12:29.041 --> 12:31.875
you have been chosen
to propose one as well.

12:34.916 --> 12:36.041
In the coming days,

12:36.125 --> 12:39.291
each of you will be granted one hour
with the king.

12:41.333 --> 12:42.541
Use it well.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.791
I know what you have been doing
in the dark of night

13:09.875 --> 13:12.666
-when you thought all eyes were asleep.
-I'm sorry.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.083
Your handmaid
will be back in a moment, my king.

13:16.166 --> 13:18.208
Then there is still time.

13:23.875 --> 13:24.958
Time for what?

13:25.041 --> 13:27.541
To warn you, young Míriel.

13:27.625 --> 13:30.416
-You're mistaken. I'm not...
-Queen yet? No.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.916
But you will be. So know this,

13:33.000 --> 13:36.166
if the old ways of our people
are not soon restored,

13:36.250 --> 13:37.958
our island will fall.

13:43.166 --> 13:44.375
Help!

13:44.958 --> 13:47.375
It's the king! Help!

13:58.583 --> 14:00.041
Come. You must go up.

14:00.125 --> 14:03.916
But don't do as I did.
I looked for too long.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.500
And now, I cannot separate
what is from what was,

14:07.583 --> 14:09.708
what was from what will be.

14:46.333 --> 14:50.833
One object. For all Middle-earth.

14:50.916 --> 14:52.750
I know it sounds strange, High King.

14:52.833 --> 14:56.000
But surely, we should exhaust
every possible solution.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.875
Precisely what manner of object?

14:58.958 --> 15:01.916
It would be smaller
than previously imagined.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.750
Something that could be carried...

15:03.833 --> 15:04.916
-A scepter perhaps.
-A sword?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.708
Or perhaps... A crown.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.125
Why a crown?

15:11.208 --> 15:13.750
A circular form will be ideal.

15:13.833 --> 15:17.666
Allowing the light to arc
back upon itself in one unbroken round,

15:17.750 --> 15:21.791
building to a power
that is all but unbounded.

15:22.791 --> 15:26.791
And you would place all that power
upon the brow of one being?

15:26.875 --> 15:29.875
Not just any one being, High King. You.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.583
Perilous are these whisperings...

15:35.666 --> 15:38.000
Sometimes the perilous path
is the only path.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.041
I wouldn't be standing here otherwise.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.208
You should not be standing here at all.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.458
High King, we ask only for the time needed

15:45.541 --> 15:48.375
to gather the Elven-smiths
and test Celebrimbor's theory...

15:48.458 --> 15:49.791
Our time runs short.

15:49.875 --> 15:52.083
-Yes, that is why...
-Shorter than you know.

15:53.625 --> 15:58.125
Since the mountain of fire's eruption,
the Great Tree is all but bleeding leaves.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.833
Soon, the last will fall.

16:00.916 --> 16:05.333
And unless our people leave these shores,
so shall we.

16:08.125 --> 16:12.125
There is no Elf in Middle-earth
who wanted a solution more than I.

16:13.083 --> 16:18.750
But if this was to be our salvation,
I'm afraid we needed it sooner.

16:18.833 --> 16:20.916
But I almost had it sooner.

16:21.375 --> 16:23.916
It was only in speaking
with the Southlander that I realized...

16:24.000 --> 16:26.416
The low man? This idea was his?

16:26.500 --> 16:30.000
His suggestions were but the key
that unlocked the dam.

16:30.083 --> 16:34.750
We are on the cusp of crafting
a new kind of power.

16:34.833 --> 16:37.875
Not of strength, but of spirit.

16:37.958 --> 16:40.458
Not of the flesh, but over flesh.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.916
This is...

16:44.000 --> 16:47.541
This is a power of the Unseen World.

16:49.250 --> 16:52.500
I am sorry, Lord Celebrimbor.

16:53.250 --> 16:56.625
You are hereby commanded
to disband the city

16:56.708 --> 16:59.708
and return to Lindon immediately.

17:00.458 --> 17:01.875
All of you.

17:16.083 --> 17:19.833
Those words, "a power over flesh."

17:20.791 --> 17:22.208
Where did you hear them?

17:23.791 --> 17:25.083
Uh...

17:26.041 --> 17:29.750
I was conferring
with my smiths. I think I...

17:31.500 --> 17:34.666
-I believe those are my words.
-Was Halbrand with you?

17:36.666 --> 17:39.833
What does it matter? It's over.

17:43.625 --> 17:45.125
High King, wait!

17:45.916 --> 17:47.916
-I am sorry...
-Grant me three months.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.458
I am owed that much.

17:50.541 --> 17:53.666
You are owed nothing.

17:54.416 --> 17:56.416
Then do it not out of recompense.

17:58.291 --> 17:59.875
Do it because I asked you.

18:01.291 --> 18:04.458
It is a fool's hope, Elrond.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.583
Merely that. Nothing more.

18:06.666 --> 18:12.083
"Hope is never mere.
Not even when it is meager."

18:13.041 --> 18:15.375
Or have you forgotten your own counsel?

19:09.166 --> 19:13.750
I need royal lineages, bloodlines.
Anything you can find on the Southlands.

19:13.833 --> 19:16.833
Our records are limited
concerning the mortal kingdoms.

19:16.916 --> 19:19.666
I'll have to scour the catacombs
for that information.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.791
-Come.
-Three weeks...

19:21.875 --> 19:25.125
Three weeks for a labor
that could take three centuries.

19:25.208 --> 19:28.208
Constraint can be
the very progenitor of invention.

19:29.375 --> 19:32.041
Go. Speak of this to no one.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.916
Don't be afraid.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.083
Celebrimbor will find a way.
I'm certain of it.

19:41.583 --> 19:44.583
All of a sudden,
the two of you seem quite familiar.

19:44.666 --> 19:47.333
I'm just offering
whatever humble aid I can.

19:49.791 --> 19:52.875
To tell you the truth,
I can still hardly believe it.

19:53.791 --> 19:56.750
Someone like me, here,

19:58.041 --> 20:00.625
working with the Elven-smiths of Eregion.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.250
Thank you, Galadriel.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.958
For bringing you here?

20:09.916 --> 20:11.333
For saving my life.

20:11.416 --> 20:15.500
As you saved mine.
Our scales are balanced.

20:15.583 --> 20:16.916
No.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.583
No, you've done far more than that for me.

20:20.875 --> 20:22.625
I'd all but given up.

20:22.708 --> 20:26.000
But you, you believed in me.

20:26.083 --> 20:27.958
You saw strength in me.

20:28.041 --> 20:31.125
You pushed me to heights
that no one else could have.

20:32.916 --> 20:34.500
I will never forget that.

20:38.583 --> 20:41.500
And I'll see to it
that no one else does either.

21:01.583 --> 21:03.916
Do not be afraid, master.

21:04.458 --> 21:10.208
The more your powers awaken,
the more the veil will weaken.

21:10.958 --> 21:12.041
Veil?

21:12.125 --> 21:17.041
The one placed upon your mind
by those who cast you down.

21:17.125 --> 21:21.583
But we have come here to welcome you in.

21:22.250 --> 21:25.083
To bring you to our lands.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.083
Your lands?

21:27.166 --> 21:28.791
You know them already.

21:35.375 --> 21:37.083
The stars.

21:37.166 --> 21:40.333
It is called the Hermit's Hat.

21:41.583 --> 21:44.625
A pattern visible in but one place.

21:45.708 --> 21:50.541
Far to the east,
where the stars are strange.

21:51.375 --> 21:54.833
The lands of Rhûn.

21:55.958 --> 21:57.708
-Rhûn...
-Yes.

21:58.791 --> 22:04.541
Where you will be known at last,
for who you truly are.

22:04.625 --> 22:09.291
You fell from the stars,
yet you are greater than they.

22:09.375 --> 22:12.125
For fire obeys your will.

22:12.208 --> 22:17.041
You fell below the dust,
yet dust fears you.

22:17.125 --> 22:19.541
For it trembles
when you are wroth.

22:19.625 --> 22:24.291
The winds and waters,
the heat and cold.

22:24.375 --> 22:28.083
In Rhûn,
you shall learn to command them all.

22:28.166 --> 22:34.166
And every being
that walks or crawls shall be your slave.

22:35.125 --> 22:38.541
For you are Lord Sauron.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.166
Enough!

23:08.666 --> 23:11.625
In time, he will learn
to control his powers.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.833
For now, bind him.

23:22.125 --> 23:23.541
What is it?

23:37.083 --> 23:39.791
Well,
in the grand tradition of bad ideas,

23:39.916 --> 23:41.583
this might well be the worst yet.

23:41.666 --> 23:43.458
Well, have you got a better notion?

23:49.791 --> 23:50.958
Third one's gone.

23:51.083 --> 23:53.500
Where'd the third one go?

23:53.583 --> 23:56.416
Better two than three. Now's our chance.

24:52.916 --> 24:54.583
-Hey!

24:55.125 --> 24:57.250
Brandyfoot! Run!

25:05.583 --> 25:06.791
Sadoc!

25:56.833 --> 25:59.666
Master, calm yourself.

26:01.708 --> 26:04.250
-Nori. Nori, let's go!

26:56.083 --> 26:57.500
-Come on!

27:21.166 --> 27:22.291
Make him see.

28:33.500 --> 28:34.958
Take it.

28:35.708 --> 28:37.541
We need you. Please, just take it.

28:38.583 --> 28:41.875
Get away from me. Or I wi...

28:43.958 --> 28:46.666
I will hurt you. Again.

28:46.750 --> 28:49.833
What? What have they done to you?

28:49.916 --> 28:53.333
They showed me what I am.

28:55.916 --> 28:57.916
Only you can show what you are.

28:59.083 --> 29:02.000
You choose by what you do.

29:16.208 --> 29:17.625
You're here to help.

29:19.666 --> 29:20.833
I know it.

29:38.916 --> 29:40.291
Close your eyes.

29:40.375 --> 29:43.000
-It'll only hurt but a moment.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.291
No!

30:11.958 --> 30:14.291
From shadow you came.

30:15.833 --> 30:18.041
To shadow I bid you return!

30:18.125 --> 30:22.625
-He is not Sauron.
-He is the other. The  Istar.  He is...

30:22.708 --> 30:24.333
I'm good.

31:06.041 --> 31:06.916
Nori!

31:18.291 --> 31:19.458
Sadoc?

31:28.666 --> 31:32.166
Hold still.
We'll find a way to carry you back.

31:32.791 --> 31:34.208
Sorry, good lady.

31:34.625 --> 31:38.375
I'm afraid I'm about
to go a' wandering off-trail.

31:40.708 --> 31:42.083
Mr. Burrows...

31:42.166 --> 31:44.833
It's all right, Proudfellow.

31:46.291 --> 31:47.916
The missus will be waitin'.

31:49.625 --> 31:54.458
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd just like to sit a while,

31:55.791 --> 31:57.208
watch the Sun come up.

33:12.458 --> 33:16.083
One, two, three,

33:16.166 --> 33:20.208
-four, five, six,

33:20.291 --> 33:22.666
seven, eight...

33:25.166 --> 33:26.250
It's nine...

33:27.708 --> 33:29.208
Stairs to main-post.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.250
You're doing well.

33:39.333 --> 33:42.750
Patronize me like that again, Captain,
I'll have your ship.

33:44.875 --> 33:46.291
Come then.

33:48.541 --> 33:49.375
I have you.

33:55.625 --> 33:57.291
And who has you?

34:02.333 --> 34:03.833
Given your loss,

34:04.791 --> 34:09.541
I would understand it if upon our return,
you wish to take a leave of duty.

34:13.916 --> 34:18.875
You once asked me
why I pulled Galadriel from the sea.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.375
I claimed to have had little choice.

34:23.875 --> 34:26.541
But the truth is,
I could have left her there.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.916
Could've refused to follow her
to Middle-earth.

34:31.583 --> 34:33.583
Or stopped my son from doing so.

34:35.750 --> 34:38.916
Yet at every turn,
I made the choices I did because...

34:40.375 --> 34:41.791
Why, Elendil?

34:44.458 --> 34:48.416
Because "Elendil" does not merely mean
"one who loves the stars."

34:49.750 --> 34:52.166
I just never imagined it would lead here.

35:04.083 --> 35:06.250
My father once told me

35:06.333 --> 35:09.083
that the way of The Faithful

35:09.166 --> 35:11.166
is committing to pay the price...

35:12.916 --> 35:15.333
Even if the cost cannot be known.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.583
And trusting that, in the end,
it will be worth it.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.791
Sometimes the cost is dear.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.250
It is.

35:36.750 --> 35:39.500
We have little choice then
but to keep serving.

35:42.250 --> 35:47.000
And I, for one, will see to it
that we make the end worth the price.

35:48.791 --> 35:50.208
Come what may?

35:51.416 --> 35:52.833
Come what may.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.666
Captain. Númenor is in sight.

36:12.791 --> 36:14.208
My Queen.

36:42.041 --> 36:45.333
Elendil, what is it? What's wrong?

36:50.958 --> 36:52.208
What is it?

36:53.708 --> 36:54.958
What do you see?

37:46.291 --> 37:47.750
-What has happened?

37:49.583 --> 37:51.833
The  mithril  is proud.

37:53.750 --> 37:57.750
It refuses every effort
to bond it with lesser ores.

37:57.833 --> 38:00.500
Tapping into the powers
of the Seen and Unseen World

38:00.583 --> 38:03.166
seemed to soften the boundaries
between the two.

38:03.250 --> 38:04.916
Doesn't make any sense.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.375
We used enough pressure
to fuse the heavens with earth.

38:07.458 --> 38:10.708
-It should have held this time!
-Patience. This is a journey.

38:10.791 --> 38:13.666
Not every step we take will be forward.
It may take time.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.625
-Time? We don't... We don't have time.
-Time...

38:15.708 --> 38:18.000
Perhaps that is enough for today.

38:18.083 --> 38:21.041
Perhaps we've been
pushing ourselves too hard.

38:21.125 --> 38:23.291
"Pushing ourselves too hard."

38:28.291 --> 38:30.041
Supposing that's the trouble.

38:31.541 --> 38:34.291
Supposing we've been using too much force?

38:34.375 --> 38:36.416
Meaning what?

38:36.500 --> 38:39.666
Meaning that the metals
shouldn't be forced to join...

38:39.750 --> 38:43.250
But more drawn or coaxed together.

38:43.333 --> 38:44.833
Now, if that's true, we've been...

38:44.916 --> 38:47.666
we've been doing it
all inside out.

38:50.041 --> 38:53.166
Quickly. Dismantle this. We start again.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.208
My lady.

39:27.625 --> 39:28.833
Galadriel!

39:30.958 --> 39:32.041
We found it.

39:32.708 --> 39:34.916
I don't know how we missed it before.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.500
It's too much power for one object.

39:38.291 --> 39:39.625
We need two.

39:40.666 --> 39:41.875
We're making two.

39:41.958 --> 39:44.250
-Two crowns?
-Not exactly.

39:44.625 --> 39:46.625
It'll need to be something...

39:47.666 --> 39:48.875
Smaller.

39:49.541 --> 39:51.208
Come, see for yourself.

39:51.750 --> 39:53.833
Not until you tell me who you are.

39:55.875 --> 39:57.458
You know who I am.

39:57.541 --> 39:59.458
Who you really are.

40:00.541 --> 40:02.708
Galadriel, I'm afraid I don't...

40:04.875 --> 40:07.291
There is no King of the Southlands.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.583
The line was broken.

40:10.500 --> 40:14.166
The last man to bear your crest
died over a thousand years ago.

40:15.291 --> 40:16.875
He had no heir.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.583
I told you I found it on a dead man.

40:34.666 --> 40:35.916
No.

40:36.583 --> 40:38.583
No, on the raft, you saved me...

40:38.666 --> 40:40.416
On the raft, you saved me.

40:40.500 --> 40:43.333
You convinced Míriel
to save the Men of Middle-earth.

40:43.416 --> 40:46.458
You convinced her.
I wanted to remain in Númenor.

40:46.541 --> 40:48.666
You fought beside me.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.916
Against your enemy. And mine.

40:56.708 --> 40:58.125
Tell me your name.

41:00.875 --> 41:04.708
I have been awake since before
the breaking of the first silence.

41:05.583 --> 41:09.083
In that time... I have had many names.

41:34.333 --> 41:36.333
Lose your footing again, sister?

41:40.791 --> 41:42.958
It was just a little tumble, is all.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.083
On your feet now.

41:58.166 --> 42:01.583
Get out of my mind.

42:02.166 --> 42:03.833
Please, sister.

42:06.416 --> 42:07.791
Look at me.

42:09.208 --> 42:10.250
Galadriel.

42:22.416 --> 42:24.041
My old dagger.

42:25.625 --> 42:27.791
You've kept it safe all this time.

42:30.833 --> 42:32.833
You have been very brave.

42:35.416 --> 42:39.416
You have fought so hard.
For so many years.

42:40.708 --> 42:42.958
To complete the task that I could not.

42:45.375 --> 42:47.541
Your task was hunting Sauron.

42:49.208 --> 42:52.625
My task was to ensure peace.

42:54.916 --> 42:59.333
But I learned
that was Sauron's task as well.

43:00.166 --> 43:01.375
No.

43:03.875 --> 43:05.291
No, you died.

43:06.166 --> 43:08.750
Along with countless others,
because of him.

43:08.833 --> 43:10.958
No, Galadriel.

43:12.750 --> 43:17.583
He was seeking a power
not to destroy Middle-earth,

43:19.000 --> 43:20.166
but to heal it.

43:23.500 --> 43:27.625
Just as your fellow Elves
are seeking to do this very moment.

43:29.416 --> 43:30.916
You needn't lie to them.

43:33.375 --> 43:35.375
Simply let the work proceed.

43:40.666 --> 43:45.291
Do you remember what I whispered
to you under this very tree?

43:51.875 --> 43:53.875
Touch the darkness once more.

44:08.500 --> 44:12.500
My brother is dead.
Because of you.

44:12.583 --> 44:16.416
Galadriel. Why would you say that?

44:17.208 --> 44:19.208
Why would you say such a thing?

44:20.250 --> 44:21.500
Galadriel.

44:23.291 --> 44:25.750
Galadriel. Come back to me.

44:25.833 --> 44:27.125
Galadriel.

44:27.833 --> 44:29.208
Look at me!

44:33.166 --> 44:35.000
Galadriel. Look at me.

44:39.875 --> 44:41.291
You know who I am.

44:43.625 --> 44:44.708
I am your friend.

44:44.791 --> 44:47.208
You are a friend of Morgoth's.

44:52.500 --> 44:54.333
When Morgoth was defeated,

44:56.625 --> 45:01.375
it was as if a great, clenched fist

45:02.791 --> 45:05.041
had released its grasp from my neck.

45:06.041 --> 45:08.833
And in the stillness
of that first sunrise,

45:09.750 --> 45:14.166
at last, I felt the light
of The One again.

45:16.625 --> 45:20.833
And I knew if ever I was to be forgiven...

45:22.208 --> 45:25.708
That I had to heal everything
that I had helped ruin.

45:25.791 --> 45:28.458
No penance could ever erase
the evil you have done.

45:28.541 --> 45:31.750
-That is not what you believe.
-Do not tell me what I believe.

45:31.833 --> 45:33.416
No. You told me.

45:33.500 --> 45:38.375
After our victory, you said that whatever
I'd done before I could be free of it now.

45:38.458 --> 45:40.833
-You deceived me.
-I told you the truth.

45:40.916 --> 45:44.500
I told you that I had done evil,
and you did not care.

45:44.583 --> 45:47.958
Because you knew
that our past meant nothing,

45:48.041 --> 45:49.708
weighed against our future.

45:50.625 --> 45:52.625
There is no such future.

45:53.916 --> 45:55.083
Isn't there?

46:17.291 --> 46:19.291
All others look on you with doubt.

46:21.875 --> 46:23.875
I alone can see your greatness.

46:28.458 --> 46:32.041
I alone can see your light.

46:33.500 --> 46:35.916
You would make me a tyrant.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.625
I would make you a queen.

46:39.041 --> 46:41.041
Fair as the sea and the Sun.

46:41.875 --> 46:44.458
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth.

46:45.250 --> 46:47.833
And you. My king.

46:49.708 --> 46:50.791
The Dark Lord.

46:50.875 --> 46:53.875
No. Not dark.

46:54.958 --> 46:56.666
Not with you at my side.

46:57.958 --> 47:01.958
You told me once, that we were
brought together for a purpose.

47:04.291 --> 47:05.625
This is it.

47:06.541 --> 47:10.375
You bind me to the light.
And I bind you to power.

47:12.625 --> 47:16.208
Together, we can save this Middle-earth.

47:18.208 --> 47:19.291
Save?

47:21.041 --> 47:22.541
Or rule?

47:24.666 --> 47:26.333
I see no difference.

47:29.458 --> 47:34.791
And that is why...
I will never be at your side.

47:39.583 --> 47:40.750
You have no choice.

47:41.208 --> 47:43.291
Without me, your people will fade.

47:43.375 --> 47:46.583
And the shadow will spread
and darken to cover all the world.

47:46.666 --> 47:49.250
-You need me.
-I should have left you on the sea.

47:49.333 --> 47:51.791
A sea you were on
because the Elves cast you out.

47:51.875 --> 47:56.291
They cast you out for deigning
to beg them for a few petty soldiers.

47:56.375 --> 47:59.875
What will they do when you tell them
that you were my ally?

47:59.958 --> 48:01.041
When you tell them

48:01.125 --> 48:04.541
that Sauron lives because of you?

48:04.625 --> 48:06.375
And you will die because of me.

48:42.666 --> 48:44.166
Galadriel!

48:51.166 --> 48:52.000
Deceiver!

48:53.041 --> 48:55.375
-Galadriel, stop! Elrond. It's Elrond.

48:55.458 --> 48:56.500
Prove it.

48:58.750 --> 49:00.166
Where did we first meet?

49:01.708 --> 49:03.791
Seaside. When I was first orphaned.

49:04.791 --> 49:08.541
I was alone. A young, half-elven boy,
without friend or kin.

49:11.625 --> 49:13.125
You gave me water.

49:17.666 --> 49:18.916
Elrond.

49:22.750 --> 49:25.166
Á cuith tessë, Galadriel.

49:26.291 --> 49:29.208
Celebrimbor. Where is he?

49:29.291 --> 49:32.666
Workshop. He'll almost be finished by now.

49:32.750 --> 49:34.000
No!

49:34.083 --> 49:37.250
Galadriel! Galadriel!
What has happened?

49:42.541 --> 49:43.625
Galadriel!

49:49.083 --> 49:50.708
-Is it done?

49:50.791 --> 49:53.416
Galadriel. You're as wet as a river rock.

49:53.500 --> 49:54.583
Why?

49:54.666 --> 49:57.583
Because I pulled her
from the waters of Glanduin.

49:57.666 --> 49:59.625
The Glanduin? What happened?

49:59.708 --> 50:00.958
Galadriel?

50:04.250 --> 50:05.750
Where is Halbrand?

50:08.208 --> 50:11.625
He is gone. And I doubt he will return.

50:13.041 --> 50:16.083
And should he ever,
none of us are to treat with him again.

50:17.333 --> 50:19.416
What happened by that stream?

50:19.500 --> 50:21.500
You spoke to me once of a mistake.

50:22.791 --> 50:24.750
One you said you would not make again.

50:26.125 --> 50:28.750
You're making that promise
very difficult to keep.

50:28.833 --> 50:31.916
Were it easy, it would not require trust.

50:39.375 --> 50:41.291
So, do we proceed?

50:41.375 --> 50:42.250
No.

50:44.958 --> 50:46.958
We must make three.

50:47.041 --> 50:48.875
Three? Why three?

50:50.791 --> 50:54.625
One will always corrupt. Two will divide.

50:54.750 --> 50:57.583
But with three, there is balance.

51:03.375 --> 51:08.375
The powers we forge today
must be for the Elves alone.

51:09.416 --> 51:11.416
Untouched by other hands.

51:12.666 --> 51:16.541
Galadriel, I have determined
that the purity

51:16.625 --> 51:19.708
of the lesser ores in the alloy
is crucial.

51:22.250 --> 51:25.666
I need gold and silver
of the most exquisite quality.

51:27.791 --> 51:29.958
I need gold and silver from Valinor.

51:34.458 --> 51:38.875
True creation requires... sacrifice.

51:47.083 --> 51:49.166
Do you remember anything more yet?

51:50.291 --> 51:53.708
Fragments. Impressions.

51:55.333 --> 52:00.000
More has come. But to discover the rest,
I know I must go to Rhûn.

52:02.625 --> 52:04.791
They were wrong about your name.

52:04.875 --> 52:08.375
What if they're wrong about that, too?
Or lying, or...

52:08.458 --> 52:11.583
What they said,
I knew to be true with a...

52:11.666 --> 52:13.958
a certainty that I can't explain.

52:17.291 --> 52:18.500
They, um...

52:19.333 --> 52:22.083
They called you something else.  "Istar."

52:23.083 --> 52:24.500
Is that your kind?

52:26.541 --> 52:27.791
"Istar?"

52:31.083 --> 52:33.333
In your tongue, that means "wise one."

52:34.416 --> 52:35.250
Or...

52:38.458 --> 52:39.791
"Wizard."

52:49.500 --> 52:50.625
Um...

52:51.416 --> 52:53.833
You're really not coming with us, are ya?

52:59.625 --> 53:04.083
Betimes, our paths are laid before us
by powers greater than our own.

53:04.750 --> 53:07.625
In those moments,
it's our task to make our feet go

53:07.708 --> 53:10.958
where our hearts wish not to tread.

53:11.041 --> 53:13.291
No matter the perils
awaiting us on the way.

53:16.875 --> 53:19.500
-Sounds a bit like an adventure.
-Oh.

53:19.583 --> 53:21.250
Alone, it's just a journey.

53:22.583 --> 53:26.000
Now adventures, they must be shared.

53:32.708 --> 53:36.916
Think I've had about as much adventure
as any Harfoot could ever hope for.

53:50.208 --> 53:53.083
Says here, if we go north-ways,

53:53.166 --> 53:56.666
we have thirty days of clear trail.

53:56.791 --> 53:58.875
All fresh grass and no trolls.

53:58.958 --> 54:00.833
-Hey, hey, hey!

54:00.916 --> 54:04.000
-All downhill, look like...
-You're holding it upside down.

54:04.083 --> 54:04.958
Eh?

54:07.250 --> 54:09.416
Sorry, Malva.
Nothing but steep slopes

54:09.500 --> 54:11.500
-and brickle-brambles for weeks.

54:11.583 --> 54:15.000
Well, if you're so quick and wise,
why don't you do the trail-finding?

54:19.083 --> 54:22.166
Watch out for little ones and stragglers.

54:22.250 --> 54:24.833
Nobody goes off-trail!

54:24.916 --> 54:27.750
And nobody walks alone!

54:27.833 --> 54:30.250
Sounded better when Sadoc said it.

54:34.125 --> 54:36.625
Wish the old goat were still with us.

54:36.708 --> 54:37.916
He is.

54:50.416 --> 54:51.250
Go on.

54:55.625 --> 54:58.083
You're a part of something bigger now.

55:00.208 --> 55:01.375
He needs ya.

55:02.583 --> 55:04.750
And you belong out there.

55:19.416 --> 55:20.750
Good-bye, Nori!

55:20.875 --> 55:22.291
-Good-bye...
-Be careful!

55:26.625 --> 55:27.750
Be well.

55:37.958 --> 55:40.208
-Did you pack your lantern?
-Of course.

55:40.291 --> 55:41.375
Good.

55:42.416 --> 55:43.583
Well...

55:44.916 --> 55:46.250
Goodbye.

55:49.250 --> 55:50.708
Nori...

55:53.458 --> 55:55.791
Right. Here's snails for the big fella.

55:55.875 --> 55:57.750
-You know how hungry he gets.

55:57.833 --> 56:01.333
And an extra blanket
in case you get cold. Right.

56:02.750 --> 56:03.916
Let's see ya.

56:11.166 --> 56:12.333
Some father.

56:13.458 --> 56:17.125
Here you're heading into the big beyond
and I haven't taught you a bloomin' thing.

56:17.208 --> 56:20.458
Oh. Hey. Sure you have.

56:23.250 --> 56:26.375
Always quench your fire
with water and earth.

56:26.458 --> 56:29.458
Don't squat by a river. Never know
when you'll need a drink downstream.

56:29.583 --> 56:30.541
And...

56:30.625 --> 56:35.833
And a Harfoot without manners is as like
to get far in life as a square wheel.

56:35.916 --> 56:37.083
Square wheel...

56:40.041 --> 56:42.541
I was listening to all of it, Father.

56:59.250 --> 57:03.750
Find where the river runs.
Where the sparrows learn their songs.

57:07.500 --> 57:08.875
I will, Mother.

57:09.625 --> 57:10.833
And I'll be careful.

57:15.625 --> 57:16.791
No.

57:22.250 --> 57:24.250
You'll be bold.

57:47.916 --> 57:50.416
Oh, go on. Go on.

57:50.500 --> 57:53.000
Go on. Before you lose your nerve.

57:55.250 --> 57:56.875
Or we lose ours.

58:08.250 --> 58:11.333
Wait! Nori!

58:11.416 --> 58:12.583
Poppy!

58:24.458 --> 58:28.125
Why does everyone I love the most
always have to go away?

58:29.916 --> 58:33.958
'Cause I think if we didn't,
then we'd never learn anything new.

58:40.250 --> 58:42.833
You'll come back? Promise?

58:44.000 --> 58:47.500
-You promise to look after everyone?
-Course I will, ankle-head.

58:50.291 --> 58:54.166
You're my best friend
in this whole wide, wild world.

58:54.958 --> 58:56.375
I'd do anything for ya.

58:58.375 --> 59:01.583
The world's not that wide, Poppy.
It's just that we're so bleedin' small.

59:08.458 --> 59:10.458
Stick close to that tall fella.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
He's a good friend in a spot.

59:13.083 --> 59:14.500
Not so good as you.

59:45.958 --> 59:48.208
-Are you certain?
-More than ever.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Well, they're all waving at you.

59:52.791 --> 59:56.041
If I turn around,
I won't ever be able to leave.

59:57.416 --> 1:00:01.416
Well, then perhaps it would be best
if you lead off.

1:00:03.125 --> 1:00:04.333
Uh...

1:00:05.500 --> 1:00:09.208
Uh, now that it comes to it,
my feet feel heavy as iron.

1:00:11.541 --> 1:00:14.833
Not to mention,
I haven't an inkling which way to go.

1:00:16.375 --> 1:00:17.375
Ah.

1:00:19.375 --> 1:00:20.833
-Hmm.
-Mmm.

1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:28.416
There it is.

1:00:29.916 --> 1:00:31.541
Are you sure?

1:00:32.208 --> 1:00:33.625
Not entirely.

1:00:34.541 --> 1:00:37.041
There's a sweet smell on the air this way.

1:00:40.083 --> 1:00:43.208
When in doubt, Elanor Brandyfoot...

1:00:45.625 --> 1:00:47.333
always follow your nose.

1:07:23.125 --> 1:07:27.500
Three rings for the Elven-kings

1:07:27.583 --> 1:07:31.916
Under the sky

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:35.291
Seven for the Dwarf-lords

1:07:35.375 --> 1:07:40.583
In their halls of stone

1:07:40.666 --> 1:07:45.125
Nine for Mortal Men

1:07:45.208 --> 1:07:49.458
Doomed to die

1:07:49.541 --> 1:07:52.791
One for the Dark Lord

1:07:52.875 --> 1:07:57.083
On his dark throne

1:07:57.166 --> 1:08:03.041
In the Land of Mordor

1:08:03.916 --> 1:08:09.916
Where the Shadows lie

1:08:12.541 --> 1:08:18.500
Where the Shadows lie

1:08:27.333 --> 1:08:32.000
One Ring to rule them all

1:08:32.083 --> 1:08:37.000
One Ring to find them

1:08:37.083 --> 1:08:42.166
One Ring to bring them all

1:08:42.250 --> 1:08:47.916
And in the darkness

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:51.166
Bind them

1:08:52.250 --> 1:08:58.250
In the Land of Mordor

1:09:01.416 --> 1:09:07.416
Where the Shadows lie...

1:09:09.875 --> 1:09:15.875
Where the Shadows lie...
