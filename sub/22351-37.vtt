00:01.990 --> 00:03.989
Julie: With only five house
guests left in the game and one

00:03.990 --> 00:07.949
week remaining before the grand
prize winner is crowned, it's

00:07.950 --> 00:10.989
time to throw a curveball at the
houseguests.

00:10.990 --> 00:18.990
Welcome to the surprise eviction
episode of "Big Brother."

00:19.990 --> 00:22.989
[Cheering and applause]
>> Announcer: Previously on

00:22.990 --> 00:25.699
"Big Brother," the poker player
cashed in.

00:25.700 --> 00:31.409
Congratulation, Vanessa, you
are the new head of household.

00:31.410 --> 00:33.289
Announcer: But found
herself caught between both

00:33.290 --> 00:33.990
sides of the house.

00:33.991 --> 00:37.989
I have Liz and Austin on one
side and Steve and Johnny Mac on

00:37.990 --> 00:38.990
the other.

00:38.991 --> 00:40.989
It's time for me to choose a
side.

00:40.990 --> 00:43.989
Announcer: Ultimately
Vanessa told Steve he might take

00:43.990 --> 00:44.990
a shot at the dentist.

00:44.991 --> 00:52.991
It's smartest for me to go
after Johnny Mac.

00:53.990 --> 00:54.990
What are you doing?

00:54.991 --> 00:58.989
It will be 3 on 1 instead of 2
on 2.

00:58.990 --> 01:00.989
Announcer: Considering
keeping the showman safe...

01:00.990 --> 01:06.289
If I'm going to keep the
showmance in the house, I better

01:06.290 --> 01:10.989
be sure the things they're
telling me they intend to stick

01:10.990 --> 01:10.991
to.

01:10.991 --> 01:15.409
Announcer: Vanessa got
Austin and his twisted alterego

01:15.410 --> 01:17.409
to make an agreement.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.989
We give you our word together.

01:20.990 --> 01:21.950
Announcer: At the
nomination ceremony...

01:21.951 --> 01:26.119
I've nominated you Steve and
you Johnny Mac.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.989
Announcer: Vanessa made her
choice.

01:27.990 --> 01:32.989
This is a decision on what I
think maximizes my probability

01:32.990 --> 01:37.989
of me getting to the finals and
nothing more announce...

01:37.990 --> 01:42.949
Announcer: Who will get the
final power of veto, which

01:42.950 --> 01:45.989
houseguest will be evicted and
who will become the next head of

01:45.990 --> 01:45.991
household?

01:45.991 --> 01:49.699
Find out right now on "big
brother."

01:49.700 --> 01:57.700
They're talking, they're
talking, they're talking.

01:58.700 --> 02:02.990
Captioning funded by CBS
[Cheering and applause]

02:32.990 --> 02:33.990
Julie: Good evening.

02:33.990 --> 02:34.990
I'm Julie chen.

02:34.991 --> 02:37.119
Welcome to "Big Brother."

02:37.120 --> 02:40.989
The houseguests have no idea,
but tonight is eviction night.

02:40.990 --> 02:45.989
It's time to mind side them with
the news.

02:45.990 --> 02:50.989
Houseguests, I need you all to
gather in the living room right

02:50.990 --> 02:54.989
now.

02:54.990 --> 02:56.989
Please sit on the side couches.

02:56.990 --> 02:59.989
Do not sit in the eviction
chairs.

02:59.990 --> 03:00.990
Hi, Julie.

03:00.991 --> 03:03.989
Julie, you're not allowed to
be here right now.

03:03.990 --> 03:04.990
Julie: Hello.

03:04.991 --> 03:07.999
Julie, why are you here on a
Monday?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.989
Julie: Liz, come on in.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.989
I need your right away.

03:13.990 --> 03:16.989
We're all waiting for you.

03:16.990 --> 03:18.829
Houseguests, I have some news
for you.

03:18.830 --> 03:21.989
We are about to begin a surprise
eviction episode.

03:21.990 --> 03:25.539
So everyone take a deep breath
and get ready because before the

03:25.540 --> 03:30.989
hour is up, one of you will be
sent to the jury house, and we

03:30.990 --> 03:33.989
will crown a new head of
household.

03:33.990 --> 03:38.989
I'll be back shortly to get
things started.

03:38.990 --> 03:41.989
But first, with Vanessa back
many power, she's once again

03:41.990 --> 03:46.989
caught between two alliances,
ultimately she chose a side,

03:46.990 --> 03:51.949
keeping Liz and Austin safe by
nominating Steve and Jackie

03:51.950 --> 03:53.829
Bradley, Jr.
With the veto looming, everyone

03:53.830 --> 03:57.989
is scrambling to figure out
their next move.

03:57.990 --> 04:02.989
This nomination ceremony is
adjourned.

04:02.990 --> 04:06.989
I am going to pieces.

04:06.990 --> 04:09.989
I'm really upset and surprised
that Vanessa decided to side

04:09.990 --> 04:12.409
with Austin and Liz instead of
me and Jackie Bradley, Jr.

04:12.410 --> 04:16.989
I... Jackie Bradley, Jr.
I never thought Vanessa would

04:16.990 --> 04:17.990
have put me up like this.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.829
The nominations have come
down to Steve and myself.

04:20.830 --> 04:23.539
I'll do whatever it takes to
keep me from walking out that

04:23.540 --> 04:25.989
door, whether it's winning the
veto or other tricks up my

04:25.990 --> 04:25.991
sleeve.

04:25.991 --> 04:33.991
I won't walk out without giving
it everything I've got.

04:35.990 --> 04:36.990
Game face.

04:36.991 --> 04:39.989
Johnny macis my maybe target.

04:39.990 --> 04:43.989
Keeping someone in the house who
has never won an h.O.H. Is

04:43.990 --> 04:45.989
dangerous because that person
will always get taken to the

04:45.990 --> 04:46.990
final three over myself.

04:46.991 --> 04:49.989
Unfortunately I had to put Steve
on the block, as well.

04:49.990 --> 04:55.989
And it doesn't feel good on a
personal level.

04:55.990 --> 04:57.989
One more hug.

04:57.990 --> 05:05.990
One more hug.

05:07.990 --> 05:09.539
Vanessa, I know.

05:09.540 --> 05:10.120
I was there last week.

05:10.120 --> 05:10.990
I know.

05:10.991 --> 05:13.989
You're good.

05:13.990 --> 05:14.999
You don't need to worry.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.989
I'm the one on the block.

05:17.990 --> 05:18.540
You're h.O.H.

05:18.541 --> 05:19.999
Why are you the one ball you
eyes out?

05:20.000 --> 05:26.989
I hope this isn't a play for me
the feel bad for her.

05:26.990 --> 05:29.989
I have to hope that he
doesn't win and then from there

05:29.990 --> 05:31.989
I'm going to have to do whatever
I'm going to have to do.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.989
I trust you.

05:33.990 --> 05:35.989
I trust Liz and Austin.

05:35.990 --> 05:37.999
I got to go with my gut.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.989
Maybe I'm wrong, and I could be
wrong, but this is what I

05:40.990 --> 05:41.990
believe.

05:41.990 --> 05:42.990
And I have to do what I believe.

05:42.990 --> 05:43.990
I get it.

05:43.991 --> 05:46.989
Anyway, you're not going home
this week.

05:46.990 --> 05:47.999
Don't stress.

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
Okay.

05:57.410 --> 05:58.989
Ready for tomorrow?

05:58.990 --> 05:59.990
Oh, yes.

05:59.991 --> 06:01.989
Oh, yeah.

06:01.990 --> 06:04.989
I'm trying to figure out
what's going on.

06:04.990 --> 06:10.989
I'm getting a vibe that I'm out
of the club.

06:10.990 --> 06:12.289
I'm just going to throw
something out there.

06:12.290 --> 06:12.990
What's that?

06:12.991 --> 06:18.989
I don't know what kind of
deal you have, but I'd consider

06:18.990 --> 06:26.990
throwing the veto to you two if
you would break that deal.

06:27.990 --> 06:31.989
It's final five, throwing a
veto, that's dumbest thing I've

06:31.990 --> 06:32.990
ever heard.

06:32.990 --> 06:33.990
All right.

06:33.991 --> 06:36.989
I'm trying to build trust with
Austin and Liz right now, so

06:36.990 --> 06:40.289
they feel like they can trust me
going into next week more than

06:40.290 --> 06:40.990
Vanessa.

06:40.991 --> 06:42.989
That's actually a really good
offer.

06:42.990 --> 06:43.990
It's a really good offer.

06:43.991 --> 06:45.999
You don't even have to take it.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.999
I might just do it on my own.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.989
Or I'd be fine going to the end
with three and knowing I'm the

06:55.990 --> 06:58.989
third man out, that's fine.

06:58.990 --> 07:02.539
You guys are safe.

07:02.540 --> 07:09.989
Yeah, I like that idea.

07:09.990 --> 07:13.699
Johnny Mac tells me he's
willing to throw the final five

07:13.700 --> 07:15.989
veto to me.

07:15.990 --> 07:16.990
What?

07:16.991 --> 07:23.989
Eitherony Machas lost his
marbles or he's become one with

07:23.990 --> 07:28.989
Judas.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.989
You scared me.

07:32.990 --> 07:37.999
Johnny Mac came up to us,
realizing things are weird

07:38.000 --> 07:41.989
around here and I'm probably the
odd man out again, so tomorrow

07:41.990 --> 07:44.989
I'm thinking I'll throw the veto
to you guys, if you guys can

07:44.990 --> 07:52.989
keep me safe with your votes.

07:52.990 --> 07:52.991
It's bizarre.

07:52.991 --> 07:58.989
Did you just tell meony
macsaid he would throw the

07:58.990 --> 07:59.990
veto?

07:59.990 --> 08:00.990
Yes, please.

08:00.991 --> 08:02.119
No thank you.

08:02.120 --> 08:08.989
Things can't get any more
ridiculous.

08:08.990 --> 08:13.409
Julie: Coming up, the power
of veto is up for grabs, and the

08:13.410 --> 08:16.989
outcome of this competition
could change everything.

08:16.990 --> 08:22.989
Then another houseguest's dream
of winning the $500,000 prize

08:22.990 --> 08:23.990
ends.

08:23.991 --> 08:26.989
Stay with us.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.990
[Cheering and applause]

08:36.540 --> 08:37.540
Julie: Can't get enough"big
brother"?

08:37.541 --> 08:39.699
There is never a dull moment.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.989
Julie: See what's happening
inside the house whenever you

08:41.990 --> 08:45.989
want with the live feed on
CBS.Com.

08:45.990 --> 08:48.990
You know you want to watch.

08:49.990 --> 08:55.700
[Cheering and applause]
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big

08:57.990 --> 08:58.990
brother."

08:58.991 --> 09:01.539
When Vanessa put Steve and
Johnny Mac on the block, she

09:01.540 --> 09:05.989
made it clear that Johnny Mac
was her target.

09:05.990 --> 09:10.989
Still, John has come up with a
risky plan to throw the veto

09:10.990 --> 09:10.991
competition.

09:10.991 --> 09:12.989
Will he go through with it?

09:12.990 --> 09:17.989
It's time to find out.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.539
Hey, everybody, it's time for
the veto competition.

09:20.540 --> 09:26.699
Let's gather in the living room.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.989
This week not only will one of
us win the power of veto, but

09:29.990 --> 09:33.289
we're all going to get to watch
CBS's new comedy "life in

09:33.290 --> 09:38.989
pieces" which Pierce this coming
Monday after "the big bang

09:38.990 --> 09:39.830
theory."

09:39.831 --> 09:42.989
"Life in pieces" is a new kind
of comedy about one extended

09:42.990 --> 09:46.989
family told in four short
stories each week.

09:46.990 --> 09:50.699
Each story is sometimes awkward,
often hilarious and ultimately

09:50.700 --> 09:50.990
beautiful.

09:50.990 --> 09:51.990
Let's take a look.

09:51.991 --> 09:56.289
New Monday, CBS is putting
together the perfect family

09:56.290 --> 09:56.990
comedy.

09:56.991 --> 09:58.989
Cheers.

09:58.990 --> 10:01.699
You sure it's okay to be
doing this here?

10:01.700 --> 10:08.989
Someone is looking at us and
he's crying.

10:08.990 --> 10:14.989
I never even held a baby
until yesterday.

10:14.990 --> 10:15.990
Made up.

10:15.990 --> 10:16.990
All made up.

10:16.991 --> 10:21.989
You have some serious trust
issues.

10:21.990 --> 10:23.539
Yeah, you do.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.989
Joni... get out of here.

10:26.990 --> 10:32.989
"Life in pieces," a new
family comedy.

10:32.990 --> 10:33.990
Some assembly required.

10:33.991 --> 10:35.989
CBS this Monday.

10:35.990 --> 10:39.989
[Applause]
>> "Life in pieces" is something

10:39.990 --> 10:41.409
I would watch back home.

10:41.410 --> 10:45.119
My family is very dysfunctional
and I can really relate to it,

10:45.120 --> 10:47.989
so I'm really excited to see
what it's all about.

10:47.990 --> 10:50.989
All right, guys, let's get
dressed and meet me in the

10:50.990 --> 10:58.989
backyard.

10:58.990 --> 10:59.990
All righty.

10:59.991 --> 11:03.409
So I walk into the become yard,
and I'm literally in the

11:03.410 --> 11:03.990
backyard.

11:03.990 --> 11:04.990
There's a playground.

11:04.991 --> 11:07.989
There's a sand works, and I'm
feeling kind of at home, but

11:07.990 --> 11:11.949
right new it's time for me to
pull through, win some comps and

11:11.950 --> 11:13.989
get myself to the end of this
game.

11:13.990 --> 11:17.829
In today's competition, your
chances of winning the veto are

11:17.830 --> 11:17.990
in pieces.

11:17.991 --> 11:20.989
In order to win safety, you'll
need to put together your giant

11:20.990 --> 11:21.990
life in pieces puzzle.

11:21.991 --> 11:24.989
When the horn sounds, your
puzzle board will become

11:24.990 --> 11:26.989
magnetized for 20 seconds.

11:26.990 --> 11:29.989
Race across your balance beam to
start assembling the pieces of

11:29.990 --> 11:32.289
your puzzle on your magnetic
board.

11:32.290 --> 11:35.989
If you don't make your way back
across the balance beam and hit

11:35.990 --> 11:40.989
your button before your clock
hits zero, your board will

11:40.990 --> 11:43.989
demagnetize and your pieces will
fall off, forcing do you start

11:43.990 --> 11:45.949
over.

11:45.950 --> 11:47.409
Also go carefully when crossing
the balance beam.

11:47.410 --> 11:51.409
If you fall off and touch the
ground, your board will also

11:51.410 --> 11:51.990
demagnetize.

11:51.991 --> 11:54.289
Any time your board
demagnetizes, you'll only have

11:54.290 --> 11:57.989
ten seconds to hit your button
and reset your timer or your

11:57.990 --> 11:58.950
game is over.

11:58.951 --> 12:02.949
The first player to complete
their life in pieces puzzle on

12:02.950 --> 12:05.949
their magnetic board then hit
their button will win the power

12:05.950 --> 12:05.990
of veto.

12:05.991 --> 12:09.989
Who is ready to play "life in
pieces"?

12:09.990 --> 12:11.949
[Applause] >> Yeah.

12:11.950 --> 12:15.989
I really want nominations to
stay the same this week, which

12:15.990 --> 12:18.989
means Johnny can't win this
thing, because that would force

12:18.990 --> 12:19.990
me to put up Liz or Austin.

12:19.991 --> 12:23.989
For me the stay in this week,
I have two options going into

12:23.990 --> 12:26.989
this veto competition, one, I
can throw it to Liz and Austin,

12:26.990 --> 12:29.989
or number two, if Steve is
getting dangerously close to

12:29.990 --> 12:32.829
winning, I have to win this for
myself.

12:32.830 --> 12:40.830
I'll have to make this decision
as I go.

12:43.990 --> 12:51.949
The object of the game is to
complete your because l word the

12:51.950 --> 12:53.119
fastest while keeping the board
magnetized.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.989
If you don't hit your buzzer in
time, all you pieces fall.

12:55.990 --> 12:58.989
You then have ten more seconds
to hit that buzzer or you will

12:58.990 --> 13:06.990
be eliminated from the game
completely.

13:22.990 --> 13:24.409
How frustrating.

13:24.410 --> 13:27.989
I was so busy looking at the
pieces and trying to order them

13:27.990 --> 13:30.989
that I lost track of time and
forget to check my timer and see

13:30.990 --> 13:32.999
if I was in the negative.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.989
Next thing I know, I've been
eliminated.

13:35.990 --> 13:37.989
Within seconds Vanessa is
already out of the competition,

13:37.990 --> 13:40.999
and I was kind of counting on
her because we had three people

13:41.000 --> 13:44.989
that would keep the nominations
the same, now it's just up to

13:44.990 --> 13:47.989
Austin and I, and Austin does
not have a good track record

13:47.990 --> 13:48.990
with puzzles.

13:48.990 --> 13:49.990
This is hard.

13:49.991 --> 13:57.991
So this one is pretty much
all on me.

13:59.990 --> 14:06.989
[Buzzer sounds] [Buzzer dings]

14:06.990 --> 14:11.989
Johnny Mac has said if given
the chance, he'll throw the veto

14:11.990 --> 14:12.990
to myself and Liz.

14:12.991 --> 14:14.989
We can't rely on that.

14:14.990 --> 14:22.990
There's no one else to go up if
Steve or Johnny Mac wins.

14:27.990 --> 14:30.989
I'm not the best at this
balance beam.

14:30.990 --> 14:31.990
I can't run across it.

14:31.991 --> 14:33.989
I don't have the balance.

14:33.990 --> 14:36.289
I look for the letters, find the
way of the show and keep working

14:36.290 --> 14:43.989
my way down.

14:43.990 --> 14:45.989
[Buzzer sounds] [Buzzer dings]

14:45.990 --> 14:50.949
My strategy is build the puzzle.

14:50.950 --> 14:53.989
Once the entire puzzle is
complete in the trough, put it

14:53.990 --> 14:54.990
on the board.

14:54.991 --> 14:56.989
But in the event I need to one
this thing.

14:56.990 --> 15:04.990
I'll be good to go.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.989
[Buzzer sounds]
>> Every time I think I got a

15:09.990 --> 15:13.989
grasp on this puzzle, something
goes wrong, I take too much time

15:13.990 --> 15:16.989
and trip and then all my pieces
go splat to the ground and I got

15:16.990 --> 15:21.989
to start all over.

15:21.990 --> 15:29.990
[Buzzer sounds] [Buzzer sounds]

15:30.990 --> 15:35.989
[Buzzer dings] [Buzzer dings]

15:35.990 --> 15:38.989
I'm looking over and seeing
Liz is doing pretty well.

15:38.990 --> 15:41.949
Maybe I can just throw this to
Liz and I don't have anything to

15:41.950 --> 15:48.989
worry about for this week
because she's doing pretty well.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.989
[Buzzer dings]
>> Almost done with my puzzle.

15:51.990 --> 15:54.989
I'm getting so frustrated
because a couple pieces aren't

15:54.990 --> 15:55.990
working.

15:55.991 --> 15:58.989
I am lived.

15:58.990 --> 16:02.409
I look over and I'm like,
Steve is getting very close.

16:02.410 --> 16:04.989
Too close for comfort.

16:04.990 --> 16:07.989
Sorry, Austin and Liz, I'm going
to finish this thing and you're

16:07.990 --> 16:09.829
going to have to trust me.

16:09.830 --> 16:11.989
I see how these pieces fitted.

16:11.990 --> 16:14.989
I know wherering goes, but all
the pieces on the top are too

16:14.990 --> 16:15.990
low.

16:15.991 --> 16:18.989
I need to push them up to fit
these pieces at the bottom.

16:18.990 --> 16:19.990
Liz is really close, too.

16:19.991 --> 16:27.991
I think it's going to come down
to the last couple seconds.

16:39.990 --> 16:40.990
Yes!

16:40.990 --> 16:41.990
Congratulation, generally.

16:41.991 --> 16:43.989
Thank you.

16:43.990 --> 16:45.119
Wow!

16:45.120 --> 16:51.119
Yes y. I was going home, but
then my friend Mr. veto showed

16:51.120 --> 16:51.990
up again.

16:51.990 --> 16:52.990
Final four.

16:52.991 --> 16:55.989
Let's keep going and kill it.

16:55.990 --> 16:56.410
Yeah.

16:56.411 --> 17:01.989
My worst-case scenario has
yet again me materialized for

17:01.990 --> 17:02.410
me.

17:02.411 --> 17:03.989
Now I have to find a new target.

17:03.990 --> 17:07.699
At this point I have no idea
what I'm going to do.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.989
What happened to everything
we talked about?

17:09.990 --> 17:11.989
This guy didn't throw the
competition, he won it.

17:11.990 --> 17:15.989
Right now my move is to talk to
Vanessa and see if she's still

17:15.990 --> 17:18.989
on board to keep Liz and I in
this game, because if she's not,

17:18.990 --> 17:22.989
I'm in trouble.

17:22.990 --> 17:26.539
Julie: Up next, Johnny Mac
has won the power of veto, and

17:26.540 --> 17:28.989
there is little doubt that he
will use it to remove himself

17:28.990 --> 17:29.990
from the block.

17:29.991 --> 17:35.289
In doing so, he will force
Vanessa to put one of her

17:35.290 --> 17:36.989
closest allies in his place.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.989
The veto meeting is next.

17:38.990 --> 17:40.990
Stay with us.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.989
Julie: Welcome back the
"Big Brother."

17:56.990 --> 18:00.989
Johnny Mac has pulled off a
crucial last-minute victory to

18:00.990 --> 18:02.989
win the veto and keep his game
alive.

18:02.990 --> 18:06.409
Assuming he removes himself from
the block, Vanessa will be

18:06.410 --> 18:10.989
forced to nominate someone from
the alliance she fought hard to

18:10.990 --> 18:15.989
keep safe.

18:15.990 --> 18:18.989
It was really close between
everyone.

18:18.990 --> 18:20.989
It was a hell of a comp.

18:20.990 --> 18:22.949
That's all I've got to say.

18:22.950 --> 18:23.830
Thank you, sir.

18:23.831 --> 18:24.989
All done.

18:24.990 --> 18:26.989
I got the veto!

18:26.990 --> 18:28.989
You're not sending me home this
week, you people.

18:28.990 --> 18:36.990
One of you has to go, and it's
not me, ha, ha, ha.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.829
Really?

18:44.830 --> 18:45.989
Oh, God.

18:45.990 --> 18:49.119
Johnny Mac was my target for
well-thought-out reasons.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.949
Now with him having to be in the
game changes everything.

18:51.950 --> 18:52.989
That was so frustrateing.

18:52.990 --> 18:55.289
You don't understand.

18:55.290 --> 18:59.989
I really believe... I don't even
know who I'm mad at.

18:59.990 --> 19:05.989
I'm just mad.

19:05.990 --> 19:09.989
This sucks.

19:09.990 --> 19:11.989
Now one of us has to go on
the block.

19:11.990 --> 19:13.989
I know.

19:13.990 --> 19:17.989
We should still have the votes.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.989
Good job, man.

19:21.990 --> 19:24.409
I was almost done.

19:24.410 --> 19:26.989
That's so annoying.

19:26.990 --> 19:30.989
Oh, that's so stupid.

19:30.990 --> 19:34.989
Now you get to decide which
way you want the ride it out.

19:34.990 --> 19:38.829
I still see the same way I
fell before the comp.

19:38.830 --> 19:41.989
Well, then either me and you
control the votes or Liz and you

19:41.990 --> 19:42.990
control the votes.

19:42.991 --> 19:50.991
It's 1-1, you know who controls
the votes.

19:55.990 --> 20:00.989
Ha, ha.

20:00.990 --> 20:08.989
I I'm happy to see Vanessa's
plan fail.

20:08.990 --> 20:13.989
You should have put up the show
man, period.

20:13.990 --> 20:14.990
Johnny Mac will want the keep
me.

20:14.991 --> 20:17.989
Liz and Austin will want to keep
each other, and that will bring

20:17.990 --> 20:19.989
the tiebreaker down to Vanessa.

20:19.990 --> 20:22.989
I think she'll keep me over Liz
or Austin.

20:22.990 --> 20:26.989
We're due to break up this
showmance and maybe we can

20:26.990 --> 20:28.989
actually do this thing.

20:28.990 --> 20:31.989
Should we forget the game or
do you want to be alone?

20:31.990 --> 20:35.989
I'd like some alone time.

20:35.990 --> 20:42.989
Thanks.

20:42.990 --> 20:48.539
I thought you were in the
shower.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.989
You had him on the ropes this
week.

20:50.990 --> 20:50.991
He won.

20:50.991 --> 20:52.989
He pulled it out again.

20:52.990 --> 20:53.990
You got to give it to him.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.989
He's got the veto, so he's
pulling himself off the block,

20:56.990 --> 20:59.989
which now means one of you guys
has to go up.

20:59.990 --> 21:01.989
We have the votes.

21:01.990 --> 21:05.989
Sending Steve out isn't what
I wanted to do.

21:05.990 --> 21:06.990
That's really bad for me.

21:06.991 --> 21:14.991
There are no words.

21:22.990 --> 21:30.990
Hey, everyone, it's time for
the veto meeting.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.699
This is the veto meeting.

21:41.700 --> 21:46.989
Steve and I have been nominated
for eviction, but I have the

21:46.990 --> 21:48.989
power to veto one of the
nominations.

21:48.990 --> 21:52.119
I want to try something a little
different this time.

21:52.120 --> 21:58.989
I have decided to use the power
of veto to save myself.

21:58.990 --> 22:01.989
Vanessa, since I have just
vetoed one of your nominations

22:01.990 --> 22:05.119
for eviction, you will have to
name a new houseguest as a

22:05.120 --> 22:11.119
replacement nominee.

22:11.120 --> 22:14.989
I'm going to try to do the
fair thing, and Liz was just on

22:14.990 --> 22:15.990
the block last week.

22:15.991 --> 22:19.699
I don't want to do it to her
again this week, so Austin,

22:19.700 --> 22:27.700
please take a seat.

22:27.990 --> 22:35.989
This veto meeting is adjourned.

22:35.990 --> 22:38.989
I'm on the block, and I'm
okay with it because I want to

22:38.990 --> 22:41.989
show Vanessa I trust her,
however, Vanessa's a great game

22:41.990 --> 22:43.989
player, and she might want the
take this opportunity to get rid

22:43.990 --> 22:48.699
of another great game player.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.989
Austin, I've enjoyed playing
this summer with you, but

22:51.990 --> 22:53.409
hopefully you're going home this
week.

22:53.410 --> 22:56.989
It's pretty much assume Liz
is going to want the keep

22:56.990 --> 22:57.830
Austin.

22:57.831 --> 23:02.989
Really my decision comes down to
do I want to just vote Steve out

23:02.990 --> 23:10.990
or leave this decision up to
Vanessa?

23:11.990 --> 23:17.989
Johnny, your style is one of
a kind.

23:17.990 --> 23:19.989
Do you even know what you're
doing?

23:19.990 --> 23:22.989
No, I just go around and I
talk to people when I have to.

23:22.990 --> 23:27.989
I'm assuming that you're
going to be able to keep Steve,

23:27.990 --> 23:31.989
but are you potentially not?

23:31.990 --> 23:34.989
If I vote him out, he'll be
pissed, but oh well.

23:34.990 --> 23:38.989
You and I could find
ourselveses with a showmance.

23:38.990 --> 23:43.699
Like are we going to go down as
the dumbest people if we don't

23:43.700 --> 23:47.989
break up those two, like right
now?

23:47.990 --> 23:48.000
Yeah.

23:48.001 --> 23:50.989
Wait a second.

23:50.990 --> 23:54.699
We're like locks to keep final
three if we keep Steve.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.989
Ly shake your hand and tell you,
I want to make final three with

23:57.990 --> 23:58.120
you.

23:58.121 --> 23:59.989
It's my best-case scenario.

23:59.990 --> 24:00.950
Let's do it.

24:00.951 --> 24:01.989
So I'm dead serious.

24:01.990 --> 24:02.990
Yeah, all right.

24:02.991 --> 24:06.989
If I keep Steve, I'm kind of
doing what she wants to do.

24:06.990 --> 24:09.989
If she wants Austin out, maybe
it's not the best move for me,

24:09.990 --> 24:14.989
maybe it's the best move for
her.

24:14.990 --> 24:18.989
I felt like I was target for
sure this week.

24:18.990 --> 24:22.989
It makes sense she wants him
here.

24:22.990 --> 24:24.989
Lids wants him out.

24:24.990 --> 24:27.989
Because he took her twin out.

24:27.990 --> 24:32.989
I'm just crazy enough to take a
showmance to the final three and

24:32.990 --> 24:33.990
that's their problem.

24:33.990 --> 24:34.990
You are crazy.

24:34.991 --> 24:39.989
Will I make a completely
illogical decision and keep

24:39.990 --> 24:43.409
Austin just to tick off Vanessa?

24:43.410 --> 24:45.989
I am crazy.

24:45.990 --> 24:47.989
I got nothing to lose, man.

24:47.990 --> 24:48.990
You are insane.

24:48.991 --> 24:54.989
I love it.

24:54.990 --> 24:59.989
Johnny Mac is a madman, and
Judas lovers it.

24:59.990 --> 25:02.989
He wants to take a showmance to
the final three.

25:02.990 --> 25:05.989
I don't even have to worry about
Vanessa breaking a tie this

25:05.990 --> 25:06.990
week.

25:06.991 --> 25:11.949
All I can do is hope that it
doesn't turn out like it did

25:11.950 --> 25:17.989
when Johnny Mac was supposed to
throw the veto to us.

25:17.990 --> 25:20.989
Julie: Up next, the game
ends for either Steve or Austin.

25:20.990 --> 25:24.989
One goes to the jury, the other
goes to the final four.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.290
Stay with us.

25:35.990 --> 25:37.989
Outgoing...

25:37.990 --> 25:38.830
What?

25:38.831 --> 25:40.989
Outspoken...

25:40.990 --> 25:43.699
<i>The</i> most idiotic conversation.

25:43.700 --> 25:44.540
Then stop having it.

25:44.541 --> 25:48.989
Outrageous...

25:48.990 --> 25:51.699
The search is on for the next
"Big Brother" houseguests.

25:51.700 --> 25:54.989
Oh, my God, why is everyone
so friggin beautiful.

25:54.990 --> 25:58.989
Do you have what it takes in
to move in and compete for a

25:58.990 --> 26:01.989
three-month power struggle for
$500,000?

26:01.990 --> 26:02.990
Yes, yes, yes.

26:02.991 --> 26:04.551
Go to CBS.Com/bigbrother for
details.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.989
Be a fly on the wall inside
the "Big Brother" house.

26:15.990 --> 26:23.990
Watch the houseguests any time
with the live feed on CBS.Com.

26:31.990 --> 26:33.989
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

26:33.990 --> 26:36.989
Steve or Austin, let's head to
the living room and find out who

26:36.990 --> 26:40.989
will become the seventh member
of the jury.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.119
Houseguests, it's time for the
vote.

26:43.120 --> 26:47.289
Steve, Austin, in just a few
moments Johnny and Liz will cast

26:47.290 --> 26:49.999
their votes to evict, but before
they do, you each have a final

26:50.000 --> 26:53.989
chance to sway their vote with
one brief statement.

26:53.990 --> 26:55.289
Steve, you're first.

26:55.290 --> 26:58.989
We had no idea this was
coming, so I didn't prepare

26:58.990 --> 26:58.991
anything.

26:58.991 --> 27:01.989
All I have to say is this has
been such a dream come true for

27:01.990 --> 27:02.540
me.

27:02.541 --> 27:04.989
I've been wanting to play this
game for about my entire life.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.989
I never thought I would be one
of the lucky ones to get the

27:07.990 --> 27:09.989
chance to come here and do this.

27:09.990 --> 27:12.989
The fact I've got to be here is
so mind blowingly incredible it

27:12.990 --> 27:14.989
is something I'll be so thankful
for.

27:14.990 --> 27:17.829
Thank you for being part of this
amazing experience.

27:17.830 --> 27:21.989
It's something I'll take with me
for the rest of my life, and I

27:21.990 --> 27:24.989
guess that's thank you so much
for being part of everything and

27:24.990 --> 27:25.999
going on this journey with me.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.989
Julie: Thanks, Steve.

27:27.990 --> 27:27.991
Austin?

27:27.991 --> 27:30.989
Well, I never thought I'd
make it here, Julie.

27:30.990 --> 27:34.829
I got to say that next Monday
night CBS will change the world

27:34.830 --> 27:37.989
with its new show "life in
piece," but today one of our

27:37.990 --> 27:42.989
"Big Brother" dreams is going to
go up in piece... or smashed to

27:42.990 --> 27:45.989
pieces, and, boy, I'm Judas and
you're the boy, right?

27:45.990 --> 27:48.989
We were never supposed to like
each other, but we've become

27:48.990 --> 27:48.991
best friends.

27:48.991 --> 27:52.989
And I see a lot of myself in
you, believe it or not.

27:52.990 --> 27:52.991
We both wanted.

27:52.991 --> 27:55.409
This I've watched you become man
in this house.

27:55.410 --> 27:56.989
I wish you the best of luck.

27:56.990 --> 27:57.990
We'll be best friends after
this.

27:57.991 --> 28:01.989
To the voters, follow your heart
and all your wildest dreams will

28:01.990 --> 28:03.949
come true.

28:03.950 --> 28:07.989
Julie, I'll see you on "the bold
and beautiful."

28:07.990 --> 28:09.989
Julie: Thank you, Austin.

28:09.990 --> 28:09.991
Thank you both.

28:09.991 --> 28:11.989
It's time for the vote to begin.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.999
As always, neither nominee is
allowed to vote.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.999
Vanessa, as head of household,
you will only vote in the event

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
of a tie.

28:19.001 --> 28:22.949
Liz, then John will enter the
diary room and cast their vote

28:22.950 --> 28:23.989
to evict.

28:23.990 --> 28:24.290
Liz, you're first.

28:24.291 --> 28:31.989
Please go to the diary room.

28:31.990 --> 28:34.989
Liz and Austin have been
attached at the hip all game

28:34.990 --> 28:34.991
long.

28:34.991 --> 28:38.949
It would be a shock if she voted
to evict him.

28:38.950 --> 28:40.989
Hi, Liz.

28:40.990 --> 28:41.990
Hi, Julie.

28:41.991 --> 28:43.989
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.829
I definitely vote to evict
Steve.

28:45.830 --> 28:48.989
Julie: Thank you.

28:48.990 --> 28:51.289
John has been closely aligned
with Steve for a good deal of

28:51.290 --> 28:55.989
the game, but is it time to cut
him loose?

28:55.990 --> 28:56.990
Hi, John.

28:56.991 --> 28:58.989
What's up, lady?

28:58.990 --> 29:01.989
Julie: Please cast your
vote for evict.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.989
Time for some blood, people.

29:03.990 --> 29:05.409
I vote to evict Austin.

29:05.410 --> 29:13.410
Thank you, John.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.989
The votes are in.

29:19.990 --> 29:20.990
We have a tie.

29:20.991 --> 29:23.999
It's now up to Vanessa, head of
household to, cast the deciding

29:24.000 --> 29:24.990
vote.

29:24.991 --> 29:26.999
Houseguest, the votes are in.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.119
We have a tie.

29:28.120 --> 29:32.989
One vote to evict Steve, one
vote to evict Austin.

29:32.990 --> 29:36.989
Vanessa, as current h.O.H., you
must decide which of these two

29:36.990 --> 29:38.989
will leave the "Big Brother"
house.

29:38.990 --> 29:41.989
When Vanessa casts her vote, the
evicted houseguest will have a

29:41.990 --> 29:45.989
few moments to say good-bye and
walk out the front door.

29:45.990 --> 29:49.539
Vanessa, please stand, face the
two nominees and cast your vote

29:49.540 --> 29:51.119
to evict.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.989
Guys, this is brutal for me,
I'm really sorry, but I came

29:54.990 --> 30:02.829
here to say... play a game.

30:02.830 --> 30:03.989
Austin, I vote to evict you.

30:03.990 --> 30:04.990
I'm sorry.

30:04.991 --> 30:08.949
I'm sorry, man, I love you to
death outside of this house, but

30:08.950 --> 30:12.539
you're an unbelievable
strategist and you're in a

30:12.540 --> 30:12.990
showmance.

30:12.990 --> 30:13.990
You can't win the game.

30:13.991 --> 30:15.829
You're not going to win the jury
votes.

30:15.830 --> 30:16.989
I know that.

30:16.990 --> 30:17.990
That's okay.

30:17.990 --> 30:18.120
I'm so sorry.

30:18.121 --> 30:20.829
I knew it was too good to be
true.

30:20.830 --> 30:24.289
I'm sorry.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.989
Johnny Mac...

30:26.990 --> 30:28.989
I'm sorry, man.

30:28.990 --> 30:35.989
Good luck, Austin.

30:35.990 --> 30:43.989
[Cheering and applause]
>> Austin, please join me and

30:43.990 --> 30:51.990
have a seat.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.999
You have to understand, if I
get to the final two with you

31:05.000 --> 31:06.989
guys, I had to.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.989
Austin, no shoes on.

31:08.990 --> 31:09.990
Clearly you did not expect.

31:09.991 --> 31:11.989
This this was your first time on
the block.

31:11.990 --> 31:12.990
Yeah.

31:12.991 --> 31:14.999
Julie: And here you are
with me evicted.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.989
You form an alliance with
Vanessa day two.

31:17.990 --> 31:17.991
Day two.

31:17.991 --> 31:19.829
But you had a rocky road.

31:19.830 --> 31:20.989
You thought she had your back.

31:20.990 --> 31:21.990
I did.

31:21.991 --> 31:23.989
What do you suppose happened
tonight?

31:23.990 --> 31:26.539
I think what happened is that
exactly what was in the back of

31:26.540 --> 31:31.409
my mind, that she saw a chance
to basically take Liz out

31:31.410 --> 31:34.989
because Johnny Mac and Steve are
going to do what she did this

31:34.990 --> 31:35.990
week if Liz doesn't win.

31:35.991 --> 31:40.989
This is her best chance to
secure herself in the final,

31:40.990 --> 31:42.829
however, there's zero chance
she'll win the game.

31:42.830 --> 31:43.989
No one on the jury will vote for
her.

31:43.990 --> 31:45.989
She was going to get to the
finals.

31:45.990 --> 31:46.990
I was going to help her.

31:46.991 --> 31:49.989
It was locked for her to be in
the finals.

31:49.990 --> 31:52.829
She didn't have to scumbag me to
do it.

31:52.830 --> 31:55.989
She chose to Judas Judas, so she
got me.

31:55.990 --> 31:57.989
I thought I was going to win the
game.

31:57.990 --> 31:59.989
And I didn't.

31:59.990 --> 32:02.989
Julie: In the final moments
you seemed pretty serious with

32:02.990 --> 32:04.829
Liz about Liz.

32:04.830 --> 32:05.290
Uh-huh.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.539
Julie: What's the plan
moving forward.

32:07.540 --> 32:09.989
I absolutely fell in love
with her.

32:09.990 --> 32:11.989
That wasn't part of the plan
coming into this game.

32:11.990 --> 32:12.990
I wasn't looking at that.

32:12.991 --> 32:15.989
I was looking at this as an
opportunity to kind of... a

32:15.990 --> 32:16.990
second chance in the
entertainment world because of

32:16.991 --> 32:18.989
everything that happened with
wrestling.

32:18.990 --> 32:21.989
I was like, oh, okay, it's stale
dream of going on "Big Brother"

32:21.990 --> 32:23.989
and everything changed as soon
as I met her.

32:23.990 --> 32:25.989
Then it was about how far can I
keep her safe.

32:25.990 --> 32:29.409
Then it became, wow, I might be
able to win this game.

32:29.410 --> 32:32.989
So a lot of emotions changed,
but for me she's probably the

32:32.990 --> 32:34.989
most important thing I'll take
from this.

32:34.990 --> 32:36.989
Julie: Once-in-a-lifetime
experience.

32:36.990 --> 32:41.949
Yeah, I feel bad that she
just got blind sided, too.

32:41.950 --> 32:43.989
Julie: We'll see you back
here a week from Wednesday,

32:43.990 --> 32:46.989
September 23rd, when you and
the rest of the jury decide who

32:46.990 --> 32:47.990
wins this whole thing.

32:47.990 --> 32:48.990
All right.

32:48.990 --> 32:49.990
Julie: Thank you, Austin.

32:49.991 --> 32:51.989
Thank you, Julie.

32:51.990 --> 32:52.990
.

32:52.990 --> 32:53.990
Julie: Stay right there.

32:53.991 --> 32:56.119
Up next the power is back up for
grabs.

32:56.120 --> 32:59.989
Up next, the winner of this head
of household competition is

32:59.990 --> 33:01.989
guaranteed a spot in the final
three one week from tomorrow.

33:01.990 --> 33:06.829
But we won't just be crowning
the winner of "Big Brother."

33:06.830 --> 33:08.989
Your favorite houseguest could
win $25,000.

33:08.990 --> 33:11.989
Here's how you can volt for
America's favorite houseguest.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.829
It's time for America's vote.

33:14.830 --> 33:16.989
The "Big Brother" houseguests
have fought hard.

33:16.990 --> 33:21.989
They've laughed, cried and
played their hearts out, and now

33:21.990 --> 33:26.989
you get to award your favorite
houseguest $25,000 in cash.

33:26.990 --> 33:29.989
The winner of this special prize
will be announced during the

live season finale of "big

33:57.990 --> 33:58.990
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

33:58.991 --> 34:02.699
John, Liz and Steve are about to
battle it out for head of

34:02.700 --> 34:02.990
household.

34:02.991 --> 34:05.989
At stake, a guaranteed spot in
the final three.

34:05.990 --> 34:10.289
Let's head to the backyard and
get things started.

34:10.290 --> 34:13.409
Houseguests, get ready for this
all-important head of household

34:13.410 --> 34:13.990
competition.

34:13.991 --> 34:15.989
The winner is not only
guaranteed a spot in the final

34:15.990 --> 34:21.989
three but is also eligible to
play in the final h.O.H.

34:21.990 --> 34:22.990
Competition of the season.

34:22.991 --> 34:26.539
Vanessa, as outgoing h.O.H., you
are not eligible to compete

34:26.540 --> 34:26.990
tonight.

34:26.991 --> 34:30.989
Tonight's competition is called
"what the bleep" and here's how

34:30.990 --> 34:30.991
it works.

34:30.991 --> 34:33.989
You will view a number of videos
containing statements made by

34:33.990 --> 34:36.989
your fellow houseguests this
summer.

34:36.990 --> 34:40.989
Each statement will feature a
bleeped-out word or words.

34:40.990 --> 34:44.989
I will then tell you what the
bleeped-out word or words might

34:44.990 --> 34:45.990
be.

34:45.991 --> 34:48.989
Your job is to determine if it's
true or false.

34:48.990 --> 34:52.539
For every correct answer, you
will be given one point.

34:52.540 --> 34:54.989
The houseguest with the most
points after seven videos will

34:54.990 --> 34:56.989
be the new h.O.H.

34:56.990 --> 34:57.990
Does everyone understand?

34:57.990 --> 34:58.990
Yes.

34:58.991 --> 35:01.699
Then let's begin.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.990
Here's your first clip.

35:04.990 --> 35:07.989
I never have gone [Bleeped].

35:07.990 --> 35:09.989
I'm starting to get angry.

35:09.990 --> 35:14.989
Julie: True or false, the
bleeped word was "picked"?

35:14.990 --> 35:15.990
Answers, please.

35:15.990 --> 35:16.990
Your answers are locked.

35:16.991 --> 35:19.989

was.

35:19.990 --> 35:22.699
I have never got picked.

35:22.700 --> 35:24.539

35:24.540 --> 35:25.989
Julie: Correct answer is
true.

35:25.990 --> 35:27.699
The bleeped word was "picked."

35:27.700 --> 35:28.989
Everyone got it right.

35:28.990 --> 35:29.990
Everyone gets a point.

35:43.120 --> 35:48.989
Julie: True or false, the

outdoors and anything of that

36:00.950 --> 36:00.990
nature.

36:00.991 --> 36:02.989
Julie: Correct answer is
false.

36:02.990 --> 36:04.539
The bleeped word was "hiking."

Everyone got it right.

36:06.991 --> 36:12.289

36:12.290 --> 36:15.989
I feel like I don't have any
[Bleeped] on myself.

36:15.990 --> 36:19.989
I've never gone after anyone,
you know, for a horrible reason.

36:19.990 --> 36:26.949
Julie: True or false, the
bleeped word was "dirt"?

36:26.950 --> 36:27.000

The word was "dirt."

36:38.990 --> 36:39.990
Steve got it right.

I know there was a plan to
take me down and [Bleeped] me

36:49.990 --> 36:52.989

two and it sucks.

36:52.990 --> 36:57.989
