WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:13.160
<i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:13.920 --> 00:18.040
<i>In Wealas, King Hywel</i>
<i>and his brother Rhodri believe victory</i>

00:18.120 --> 00:19.960
<i>at Tettenhall has brought peace.</i>

00:20.040 --> 00:24.880
I'm going on a pilgrimage and you can rule
from the fortress in my absence.

00:24.960 --> 00:29.280
[Uhtred] <i>But a new Dane warrior will</i>
<i>harness Brida's fury against the Saxons.</i>

00:29.360 --> 00:33.120
-I do not know you.
-Cnut's cousin. Sigtryggr of Irland.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.880
It is Cnut's babe you carry,
or that of a Welshman?

00:35.960 --> 00:39.800
<i>I have returned to Aegelesburg</i>
<i>with the truth of Eardwulf's treachery.</i>

00:40.160 --> 00:44.760
Eardwulf has confessed to the murder
of Lord Aethelred and he has fled Mercia.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.680
<i>Thanks to the kindness</i>
<i>of those loyal to her,</i>

00:47.880 --> 00:50.480
<i>Aethelflaed has been reunited</i>
<i>with her daughter.</i>

00:50.720 --> 00:54.200
A miracle has occurred
and you are mistaken in your heartbreak.

00:54.280 --> 00:57.640
<i>I hope that my love for Aethelflaed</i>
<i>will be allowed to flourish.</i>

00:57.720 --> 01:02.080
To live in peace by your side,
to raise my daughter in safety,

01:02.400 --> 01:04.720
nothing would bring me greater happiness.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.200
<i>Yet, with an empty throne...</i>

01:06.280 --> 01:07.520
Calm yourselves!

01:07.600 --> 01:09.319
<i>...Mercia remains in turmoil.</i>

01:09.519 --> 01:10.360
[grunts]

01:10.880 --> 01:14.960
<i>Edward's heart hardens further,</i>
<i>even against his own son.</i>

01:15.320 --> 01:19.280
-He is Aethelstan.
-He cannot be here.

01:19.360 --> 01:22.720
<i>And my fate has changed</i>
<i>with an unexpected offer.</i>

01:23.080 --> 01:28.280
If I place someone to rule here
who might forge a path to peace,

01:28.360 --> 01:31.320
I wondered if that person should be you.

01:31.640 --> 01:34.000
-[Finan] To Uhtred of Mercia!
-[cheering]

01:34.080 --> 01:36.960
[all] Uhtred of Mercia!

01:37.400 --> 01:39.080
[Uhtred] <i>Destiny is all!</i>

02:03.760 --> 02:04.600
Go.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.880
[chickens clucking]

02:19.240 --> 02:20.240
[bleating]

02:28.120 --> 02:29.160
[trickling]

02:31.960 --> 02:33.480
[horse neighs sharply]

02:37.960 --> 02:39.960
[tense music plays]

02:41.880 --> 02:42.720
[horse neighs]

02:44.520 --> 02:45.680
Danes!

02:46.720 --> 02:48.280
Danes!

02:48.360 --> 02:51.840
[yelling and grunting]

03:08.680 --> 03:10.280
[groaning]

03:11.040 --> 03:13.720
[grunting continues]

03:20.080 --> 03:22.480
[breathing heavily]

03:28.920 --> 03:31.560
[intense vocalizing]

04:14.360 --> 04:15.200
[woman whimpers]

04:21.560 --> 04:22.399
[yelps]

04:23.880 --> 04:25.200
[baby crying]

04:36.040 --> 04:36.880
[Brida] Burn it.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.440
We have everything gathered.

04:43.040 --> 04:43.880
Move!

04:45.200 --> 04:46.080
Back to the fort.

05:31.760 --> 05:32.720
[sighs softly]

06:03.480 --> 06:05.480
Out surveying your kingdom, Lord Uhtred?

06:06.640 --> 06:09.720
-I do not wish to argue.
-Then do not go through with this.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.680
You are not the right person
to rule Mercia.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.120
How can you be certain?

06:14.760 --> 06:18.280
You are wild and impetuous,
ruled by your heart and instinct.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.840
And these are all things I love about you.

06:21.160 --> 06:24.000
But it is not what Mercia requires
of a ruler right now.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.640
It needs someone considered and diplomatic

06:27.720 --> 06:31.040
who can rebuild the kingdom
and forge alliances that are equal.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.400
I can be diplomatic when it is required.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.480
Mercia needs a ruler who is not a tyrant,
imposed by Wessex.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.280
That is how it will appear
if you are Edward's choice

06:40.360 --> 06:42.120
to be Lord and Protector of Mercia.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.160
[sighs]

06:47.080 --> 06:49.640
This is the best we can do for Mercia
right now.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.400
Another Lord may not feel
as well disposed to you.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.320
You could be banished.

06:58.440 --> 06:59.280
That is true.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.000
And still, you would prefer it
than I take the throne?

07:03.200 --> 07:06.280
If you are asking me to choose between
a Lord who is best for me

07:06.360 --> 07:08.160
or one who is best for Mercia,

07:08.240 --> 07:10.760
-I will choose one who is best for Mercia.
-[sighs]

07:11.720 --> 07:13.720
Mercia's needs are greater than mine.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.040
-I did this for you.
-I know.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.200
So that you and Aelfwynn would be safe.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.680
If I am ruler of Mercia,
I can protect you.

07:21.200 --> 07:25.160
I appreciate all you have done for us,
Uhtred. But it does not change

07:25.240 --> 07:28.840
my conviction that Mercia needs a ruler
who is independent of Wessex.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.160
[door opens]

07:32.280 --> 07:35.880
-Apologies, I can return if you wish.
-I was just leaving, Father.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.480
I know you will do what is right.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.960
-What is so important?
-I wanted to discuss your baptism.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.400
The Lord of Mercia must be Christian.
It is written.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.720
I have been baptized by Father Beocca.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.800
-Twice.
-That was many years ago,

08:00.880 --> 08:03.520
and the life you've lived since
has not been very Christian,

08:03.600 --> 08:05.600
so, some of the Ealdormen

08:05.680 --> 08:08.480
-wish to witness your baptism in person.
-[groans]

08:10.800 --> 08:12.560
Is my word not enough?

08:12.640 --> 08:16.160
If there are doubts, why not give
the Ealdormen the proof they require?

08:16.800 --> 08:19.240
-[sighs]
-Is the prospect of inviting God

08:19.320 --> 08:22.440
into your heart again really so abhorrent
that you are willing to give up--

08:22.520 --> 08:25.040
-No.
-...the opportunity to be ruler of Mercia.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.920
-Fine!
-Resolve all of this?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.120
I will get baptized... again!

08:30.280 --> 08:31.320
For the third time.

08:33.760 --> 08:34.600
[Uhtred groans]

08:34.680 --> 08:35.520
Good.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.360
[Sigtryggr]
This will be a great home for us.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.240
We can rest here for a while. [laughs]

08:52.520 --> 08:54.640
Brida! Where are all the women?

08:54.880 --> 08:57.880
Welsh women fight back.
We had to kill them.

08:58.880 --> 08:59.720
You did well.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.120
With this and what we've already gathered,
we have more than enough to leave here.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.000
Leave and go where?

09:05.840 --> 09:10.440
To Wessex or Mercia. I'm tired
of killing farmers and their wives.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.440
My men have traveled from Irland
after months of battle.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.280
They are tired.
And where better to rest than here?

09:18.480 --> 09:20.680
We have food. We are safe.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.680
There's no reason to leave.

09:24.280 --> 09:28.040
Edward and Uhtred slaughtered our kin.
They must pay for that.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.240
-And they will.
-When?

09:29.320 --> 09:30.680
When the time is right.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.840
I did not keep myself alive in that hole
in the ground

09:33.920 --> 09:37.080
to watch your men get fat here
while the Saxons grow stronger.

09:37.440 --> 09:41.160
They are weak now after Tettenhall.
They will not expect us to attack.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.920
You have a warrior's spirit,
and this is good.

09:45.920 --> 09:49.760
But if I ask my men to fight,
it must be for a reason I believe in.

09:50.080 --> 09:54.000
They will fight to protect their families,
or for food, or for land.

09:54.480 --> 09:57.960
But vengeance for Tettenhall...
it is not enough.

10:03.440 --> 10:07.280
I will go to find our allies to the north.
They will fight the Saxons.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.560
Then that is what you must do.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.120
I need ten men to escort me on my journey.

10:15.000 --> 10:15.840
You owe me that.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.040
You can have five.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.360
[both giggling]

10:32.240 --> 10:33.720
[Aelfwynn] Look how high I can go,

10:33.800 --> 10:35.920
-[Aethelstan] I can go higher.
-Nearly touch the sky!

10:36.200 --> 10:38.200
-[Eadith] Lady Aethelflaed.
-You can sit.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.440
No, I am higher...

10:41.640 --> 10:43.440
I was wrong to doubt you.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.560
You delivered my message
to Lord Uhtred as you said you would.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.120
I was happy to be of assistance.

10:51.520 --> 10:55.280
And I am told you cared for Aelfwynn
on the road, cooled her fever.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.960
She is a fearless child.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.280
It must be in her blood.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.440
-The child is fond of you.
-And I her.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.160
Perhaps I could be of use to her here.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.360
[sighs]

11:12.280 --> 11:13.680
I am curious.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.600
Why did you reveal Eardwulf
as Aethelred's murderer?

11:18.160 --> 11:19.000
Uh...

11:20.280 --> 11:23.840
Eardwulf may be my brother,
but I knew what he did was wrong.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.280
I choose to be loyal to you
and Lord Uhtred

11:27.360 --> 11:29.720
because I believe
in what you and he are doing.

11:31.880 --> 11:35.160
[children giggling]

11:39.440 --> 11:40.400
[door opens]

11:56.640 --> 11:59.000
I thought you would be happy
to see me baptized.

11:59.400 --> 12:04.200
I would, if I believed you were sincere
in accepting God into your heart.

12:04.920 --> 12:09.520
Do you worry if every child baptized is
sincere in accepting God into their heart?

12:09.880 --> 12:13.520
[scoffs] I'm confident few of them
are using it to lay claim to a throne.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.600
God is infinitely wise, is he not?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.720
He will know if I am sincere.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.360
Lord Uhtred, come forward
and receive God's grace.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.200
[Uhtred sighs]

12:36.000 --> 12:39.320
-[men laughing]
-Up! Up! Up! Down!

12:39.880 --> 12:43.600
As I am leaving, does anybody want my dog?

12:44.160 --> 12:46.040
Does anybody want my dog?!

12:46.120 --> 12:50.560
All you have to do is feed him
and water him. And beat him!

12:50.640 --> 12:51.560
[groans]

12:51.640 --> 12:53.920
Beat him every day!

12:54.000 --> 12:57.160
[laughs] Up you get. Move!

12:57.600 --> 13:00.560
-[Rhodri groaning]
-[Brida grunting]

13:00.640 --> 13:01.840
[gasping]

13:02.160 --> 13:03.000
[Brida grunts]

13:05.840 --> 13:06.760
Do you want a dog?

13:07.760 --> 13:09.520
[men muttering]

13:09.600 --> 13:10.880
Nobody wants you, dog.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.320
-[Brida grunts]
-[Rhodri groaning]

13:15.400 --> 13:17.720
[men laughing]

13:42.920 --> 13:45.360
I know you have your doubts
about Lord Uhtred,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.160
but I am confident
it is the right decision.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.600
It is not that I doubt him.

13:51.680 --> 13:55.160
I just cannot forget that he held a knife
to your father's throat

13:55.640 --> 13:57.000
and threatened to kill him.

13:57.400 --> 14:01.920
Lord God, drive from Uhtred
all the blindness of his heart. [blows]

14:03.840 --> 14:07.400
We ask you, Lord, to mercifully hear
our prayers and protect Uhtred.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.240
We mark him with the sign of your cross.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.560
God, who is creator of all people,

14:14.280 --> 14:17.320
let us rejoice in the gift of grace
bestowed on Uhtred

14:17.640 --> 14:21.800
that he could not attain on this earth,
but only by divine blessing.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.600
You are now catechumen.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.080
I ask your sponsor to come forward.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.480
[gentle, dramatic vocalizing]

15:14.080 --> 15:15.560
Receive your servant Uhtred

15:15.640 --> 15:19.120
into the ranks of your devout saints
and most bright angels.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Let the water cleanse him so that he may
know your wisdom to do what is just.

15:24.760 --> 15:28.000
Uhtred, you are now a child of God.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.400
-Amen.
-[all] Amen.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.160
[all] Yes!

15:39.240 --> 15:42.360
[pants] I don't think I can stomach
another drop of ale, Finan.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.840
Whoa-oh!
Everyone knows you cure like with like.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.960
So, only more ale
will make you feel better.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.160
Makes perfect sense.

15:50.240 --> 15:55.880
Let me introduce to you the new Lord
of Mercia's most trusted advisors.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.760
-[exhales]
-Mm,

15:57.840 --> 16:00.000
they do not look like Lord's advisors
to me.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.560
-[exhales]
-How many advisors have you met?

16:03.640 --> 16:06.960
-None, I suppose.
-Well, this is what they look like.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.640
-[chuckles]
-[Finan] Now, fill our cups with ale,

16:09.720 --> 16:13.080
and we'll tell you
what great plans we have for Mercia.

16:13.160 --> 16:14.480
Hey, hey, hey. Stay awake.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.400
Mm.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.600
-[Stiorra] Mmm!
-Mm.

16:17.880 --> 16:18.840
-Not hers.
-[scoffs]

16:18.920 --> 16:20.520
-She will have milk.
-[Stiorra] What?

16:20.600 --> 16:24.680
I'm not incurring the wrath of the Lord
and Protector of Mercia on his first day--

16:25.040 --> 16:28.720
[gulping]

16:29.040 --> 16:31.240
[inhales, sighs]

16:35.880 --> 16:41.320
[laughing]

16:42.960 --> 16:44.560
[Edward] Are you ready to serve?

16:46.280 --> 16:47.160
I am, Lord King.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.080
After the Witan,
you and I should speak alone.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.320
I wish to share with you my plans on how

16:58.400 --> 17:01.720
the alliance between Wessex
and Mercia is to proceed.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.760
It is important you know
exactly what needs to be done.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.080
Yes, Lord King.

17:13.319 --> 17:16.560
It is done, Aethelflaed. Accept it.

17:17.480 --> 17:21.160
Uhtred has been baptized
and will be the Lord of Mercia.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.079
And it is not the worst outcome.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.400
-I recall a time you wished Uhtred dead!
-I did.

17:28.160 --> 17:32.000
But your father saw something in Uhtred
that I was blind to.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.840
Alfred was a wise judge of character.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.800
Uhtred is a good man,
but he is not the right man.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.560
He is being forced on Mercia by
my brother, and that cannot be accepted.

17:42.640 --> 17:46.160
The Witan will decide
who rules Mercia, not Edward.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.840
You know that is nonsense!

17:48.040 --> 17:51.000
Edward is acting as if Mercia
is his kingdom, and it is not.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.840
We are his allies, not his subjects.
He needs to accept that.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.680
Your brother is doing
what he believes is best.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.960
[scoffs] Best for him, not Mercia.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.520
Is it so much to wish
that Mercia have a ruler

18:03.600 --> 18:05.520
that has not been selected by Wessex?

18:06.440 --> 18:08.680
You can wish, but that is all.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.720
These decisions are not made by us.

18:12.840 --> 18:15.400
You think I would not have liked
a greater voice,

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
instead of having to stand there quietly
while men blithely make foolish decisions?

18:21.840 --> 18:23.840
-This is our lot.
-[knock on door]

18:25.680 --> 18:26.640
They are gathering.

18:41.760 --> 18:42.680
[horse neighs]

18:43.800 --> 18:44.760
[Hywel] Dear God...

18:46.480 --> 18:47.400
[guard] Lord King?

18:49.400 --> 18:50.880
[Hywel] God rest their souls.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.440
-[leaves rustle]
-[twig snaps]

18:54.120 --> 18:57.160
[baby crying]

18:57.240 --> 18:58.080
Quiet!

18:58.520 --> 18:59.680
[crying continues]

19:13.920 --> 19:16.480
[crying continues]

19:16.560 --> 19:18.200
[shushing]

19:18.920 --> 19:21.440
[in Welsh] It is all right, little one.
You are safe.

19:21.680 --> 19:25.240
Who was it who attacked your village?
Danes?

19:28.880 --> 19:29.720
[sighs]

19:30.520 --> 19:33.040
[Hywel] Don't worry.
We will right this wrong.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.440
The Witan is gathered.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.400
[indistinct chatter]

20:01.880 --> 20:03.080
Lord God in heaven,

20:03.840 --> 20:07.480
grant this Witan the benefit of
your divine wisdom as you guide us today.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.400
-Amen.
-[all] Amen.

20:19.880 --> 20:24.200
No one here would deny that Mercia
is one of the ancient Saxon kingdoms.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.560
[murmurs of approval]

20:25.640 --> 20:28.640
But a kingdom without a ruler
is a ship without a steersman.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.720
It drifts with no purpose
and breaks on the rocks.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.480
[murmurs of approval]

20:33.560 --> 20:37.720
It is, and has ever been, the right
of the Witan to decide Mercia's ruler.

20:37.920 --> 20:41.000
-[man] Well said!
-As Aethelred has departed this world...

20:42.480 --> 20:44.680
we must choose.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.400
[murmurs of approval]

20:46.480 --> 20:50.520
[Ludeca] Lord Uhtred has been proposed
as Lord and Protector of Mercia.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.880
Mercia has lost many sons
repelling the Danes.

20:53.960 --> 20:57.880
Our army is weakened.
Our villages wracked with sickness.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.040
We've never been more vulnerable.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.440
To defend our kingdom,
we must choose a ruler

21:02.760 --> 21:05.360
who will stand shoulder to shoulder
with our neighbors in Wessex.

21:05.440 --> 21:09.920
I can assure you, Wessex has no desire
to influence this Witan.

21:11.160 --> 21:14.320
Our only wish is that the new Lord
maintains the strong bond

21:14.400 --> 21:15.920
between our two kingdoms.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.560
[murmurs of approval]

21:17.640 --> 21:19.800
Lord Uhtred has not only served Wessex,

21:19.880 --> 21:23.160
he also fought valiantly at Tettenhall
to defend Mercia.

21:23.640 --> 21:24.880
And let us not forget,

21:25.360 --> 21:28.920
he only holds the throne
until a younger Ealdorman comes of age

21:29.000 --> 21:31.120
and Lady Aelfwynn is old enough to marry.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.880
Does the Witan object?

21:37.440 --> 21:38.560
[murmur]

21:48.960 --> 21:51.000
Then step forward, Lord Uhtred.

21:59.400 --> 22:05.280
Uhtred, Lord and Protector of Mercia,
you may take your throne.

22:06.560 --> 22:10.560
[Witan beating chests]

22:13.120 --> 22:15.880
[Witan chanting] Aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye...

22:15.960 --> 22:19.800
-Trust your brother's instincts.
-[Ludeca] I invite the Ealdormen

22:19.880 --> 22:22.560
to step forward
and take their oaths to Lord Uhtred.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.160
I would like to address the Witan.

22:25.240 --> 22:29.480
-[Witan murmuring]
-[man] What is this?

22:29.560 --> 22:33.640
As you know, I have fought side by side
with the men of Mercia.

22:34.320 --> 22:38.520
That you accept me as your Lord,
it is an honor I will never forget.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.960
And that's what makes what I have to say
even more difficult.

22:43.120 --> 22:48.240
However, there is someone better suited
to rule Mercia than I.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.880
Someone who cares for Mercia
more than themselves,

22:52.200 --> 22:57.000
someone who can be an equal ruler
alongside our Lord King Edward.

22:57.600 --> 23:01.320
And so, as my first act as Lord of Mercia,

23:02.600 --> 23:05.320
I feel I have no choice
but to relinquish the throne...

23:05.400 --> 23:08.040
-[Witan clamoring]
-...in favor of Lady Aethelflaed,

23:08.120 --> 23:11.000
who's led you to victory
when Aethelred abandoned you...

23:11.760 --> 23:14.520
who's always put the welfare
of Mercia first.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.320
A woman cannot sit on the Mercian throne!

23:17.400 --> 23:20.200
-She is the ruler Mercia requires!
-That is enough!

23:20.920 --> 23:21.960
Silence!

23:22.760 --> 23:25.880
Lady Aethelflaed cannot rule Mercia.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.920
With respect, Lord King,
you know that only the Witan

23:29.000 --> 23:30.400
can decide who rules Mercia.

23:30.480 --> 23:34.160
That is exactly what concerns me
about a woman holding the throne.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.760
Because were she to marry,

23:36.080 --> 23:40.880
her husband could become the new Lord
of Mercia, bypassing this Witan.

23:41.240 --> 23:45.480
If I may speak, I am devoted to Mercia.

23:45.560 --> 23:48.440
I would never be swayed
to act against its interests.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.760
That may be true,
but King Edward is correct.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.840
It has always been the preference
of the Witan

23:52.920 --> 23:56.600
-that a woman should not take the throne.
-[Ludeca] Only a preference, not the law.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.240
King Offa's widow ruled Mercia
for many years and did it well.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.400
If you allow Lady Aethelflaed
to take the throne,

24:03.480 --> 24:07.080
you are exposing Mercia to great risk!

24:07.360 --> 24:09.320
[murmurs of approval]

24:09.400 --> 24:10.960
Perhaps I have a solution.

24:11.760 --> 24:15.040
If it provides the Witan
with the reassurance it requires,

24:15.280 --> 24:20.760
I will swear an oath that as long as I am
Lady of Mercia, I will remain chaste.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.160
This is not something that I do lightly,

24:23.240 --> 24:26.040
but it is a sacrifice
I am willing to make for Mercia.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.400
No. This is not acceptable.

24:33.160 --> 24:36.320
I propose the Lady Aethelflaed as ruler
of Mercia.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.520
[Witan murmuring]

24:39.720 --> 24:41.320
Who supports Lord Uhtred?

24:45.400 --> 24:46.520
[all] Aye!

24:47.920 --> 24:50.080
[all chanting] Aye, aye, aye!

24:50.160 --> 24:51.800
Aye, aye, aye!

24:51.880 --> 24:53.800
Aye, aye, aye!

24:53.880 --> 24:56.440
Aye, aye, aye...

24:56.760 --> 25:00.880
Say it, Lady Aethelflaed,
so that we may witness your oath.

25:00.960 --> 25:05.720
I swear... that as long as
I hold the Mercian throne,

25:06.560 --> 25:07.840
I will remain chaste.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.040
-[Ludeca] Is the Witan agreed?
-[all] Agreed!

25:11.120 --> 25:13.080
Agreed!

25:13.160 --> 25:16.200
Then, Lady Aethelflaed,
you may take the throne.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.720
[Witan chanting] Aye, aye, aye!

25:31.000 --> 25:32.960
Aye, aye, aye!

25:33.040 --> 25:34.000
Aye, aye...

25:34.320 --> 25:37.240
[Cenric] Clear the street!
Back to your homes!

25:39.000 --> 25:40.080
[retches]

25:40.400 --> 25:41.480
-Move.
-[Sihtric] Hey!

25:43.720 --> 25:44.560
[Osferth groans]

25:45.720 --> 25:46.600
Hide yourself.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.160
-Finan, I'm--
-Stiorra!

25:50.280 --> 25:53.440
[Cenric] Ensure that nobody resists
and the gates remain closed.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.240
[Cenric] Guards of Wessex, spread out!

25:59.720 --> 26:01.280
Take up your positions!

26:01.360 --> 26:02.760
[guards shouting]

26:02.840 --> 26:03.720
Man the gates!

26:04.520 --> 26:07.800
If today were not a celebration
of the new Lord of Mercia,

26:08.360 --> 26:11.600
I would fear that King Edward's guards
were seizing Aegelesburg.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.800
They do not look like
they are celebrating.

26:13.960 --> 26:17.120
We need to find Uhtred... and advise him.

26:18.520 --> 26:19.360
Hey, hey!

26:20.560 --> 26:24.680
[man] In the name of the Lord,
I wish to be loyal...

26:27.880 --> 26:29.600
Your reign was brief, Lord Uhtred.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.280
[man] I offer myself...

26:32.360 --> 26:34.520
But in that time,
you've served Mercia well.

26:36.120 --> 26:37.440
We have the ruler we need.

26:38.800 --> 26:39.920
Yes, you do.

26:52.200 --> 26:55.200
King Edward's guards
have taken control of Aegelesburg.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.920
[Cenric] Stay alert on the ramparts!

27:05.920 --> 27:07.720
Take your position on the West Gate!

27:12.560 --> 27:14.120
Pyrlig, what is this?

27:14.480 --> 27:17.200
This is what happens when King Edward
feels he's been insulted.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.080
This is Mercia. He has no right.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.720
I suspect he believes
his army gives him the right.

27:21.800 --> 27:22.680
Let us not forget

27:22.760 --> 27:26.520
that Mercia and Wessex are allies.
I would like to speak with my brother.

27:26.600 --> 27:29.520
The King is at prayer
and says he does not wish to be disturbed.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.520
Please tell him I wish to see him.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.240
I will relay your message.

27:34.240 --> 27:38.400
[guards shouting]

27:46.960 --> 27:48.200
Where were the Mercians?

27:48.280 --> 27:50.960
How could Edward seize Aegelesburg
without opposition?

27:51.040 --> 27:53.600
The Mercian Guard is leaderless
without Eardwulf

27:53.680 --> 27:56.080
and the fyrd is disheartened
and scattered.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.960
Without an army, how do we respond?

27:58.040 --> 28:00.600
We do nothing until I have had
a chance to talk with Edward.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.880
-And what if he will not talk to you?
-Then I will wait.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.040
[Aldhelm] His men are everywhere.
You're not safe here.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.080
Perhaps it would be wiser to move
somewhere else.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.200
-No. I remain here.
-Even if that places you in danger?

28:10.440 --> 28:13.400
My first act as Queen cannot be
to flee Aegelesburg.

28:13.480 --> 28:16.880
-Is that not preferable to being killed?
-I hope it will not come to that.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.720
-[Aldhelm] So, we just sit here and wait?
-Or we can eat and wait.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.000
Or later sleep and wait. But we wait.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.640
Because we cannot rush Mercia
into conflict with Wessex.

28:24.720 --> 28:28.280
Stay with Aethelflaed. Guard her quarters.
No one is to enter without her permission.

28:28.360 --> 28:29.560
What about her brother?

28:29.640 --> 28:31.440
No one. You two, with me.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.920
-Where, Lord?
-To ensure Aethelflaed

28:34.000 --> 28:36.960
will not have to rely on
Edward's goodwill for her survival.

28:39.600 --> 28:42.240
[intense vocalizing]

29:04.200 --> 29:06.040
[horses grunting]

29:24.640 --> 29:26.560
-I'm Eardwulf.
-[Brida] Ah, yes.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.560
You're the arse-licker?

29:29.240 --> 29:32.960
I'd heard there were Danes in Wealas
and I was coming to talk to you.

29:33.120 --> 29:37.840
-I don't talk to Saxons, I kill them.
-You will change your mind when you hear

29:37.920 --> 29:42.040
what I have to say. I have something
very valuable that I can share with you,

29:42.120 --> 29:43.880
something that will help-- [grunts]

29:47.440 --> 29:48.280
[chuckles]

29:50.840 --> 29:51.680
[groans]

29:52.320 --> 29:53.800
I thought he'd never shut up.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.920
Is it true my father relinquished
the throne to Lady Aethelflaed?

30:04.840 --> 30:05.680
It is.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.720
Was that his intention all along?

30:10.440 --> 30:12.040
The only reason he was baptized?

30:13.800 --> 30:17.480
Perhaps I should be angry with him
for mocking God.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.400
[scoffs] You know, but I am not.

30:24.880 --> 30:28.440
Your father is a man
of strong convictions, as are you.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.960
He is driven by his passions.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.680
-But he does not act with bad intent.
-I know.

30:36.600 --> 30:40.080
And I am grateful to him.
He tests my faith, again and again.

30:40.440 --> 30:43.400
-And each time, it grows stronger.
-That pleases me to hear.

30:43.640 --> 30:47.680
But what is also very clear to me now
is that I must follow my calling...

30:49.200 --> 30:52.520
to serve God and only God.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.400
So, I must go.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.800
Do you think it is wise to bring
the child here?

31:09.520 --> 31:10.360
Join us.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.280
What is that you have?

31:25.040 --> 31:27.960
-Is it a man?
-No. It's a king.

31:31.680 --> 31:32.760
Is he a good king?

31:33.360 --> 31:35.600
Yes... like you.

31:37.480 --> 31:41.160
Now that you have taken Aegelesburg,
what will you do with it?

31:41.240 --> 31:45.440
Hold it, until Mercia is in the charge
of someone I trust.

31:46.760 --> 31:50.240
-You can trust Aethelflaed.
-So, you side with my sister?

31:50.880 --> 31:55.200
I take the side of our family,
and perhaps Uhtred has done us a service.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.240
By breaking his word
and going against my wishes?

31:59.080 --> 32:05.160
Thanks to Uhtred, our family now sits
on the thrones of both Wessex and Mercia.

32:06.880 --> 32:12.160
And your father's dream
of a united England is even closer.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.480
Aethelflaed is your blood...

32:16.440 --> 32:18.880
and she will be loyal to you
if you allow her.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.560
She is not a threat, Edward.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.720
[Hywal] Deheubarth Fortress lies ahead.

32:26.040 --> 32:30.240
It will be well defended, but we have
darkness and surprise on our side.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.880
So, move swiftly and attack without mercy.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.320
[commander] Yes, Lord King.

32:45.720 --> 32:48.880
Danes. I can smell their stench from here.

32:49.120 --> 32:53.400
-Shall we attack or retreat?
-We are men of Wealas. We attack!

32:53.880 --> 32:55.880
-Form a line!
-Form a line!

33:01.160 --> 33:03.760
Slaughter them! Slaughter them all!

33:03.840 --> 33:06.080
[all yelling]

33:10.200 --> 33:12.200
[tense music plays]

33:13.760 --> 33:14.800
Loose!

33:21.720 --> 33:25.560
[commander] Do not be afraid.
We will prevail!

33:27.760 --> 33:29.200
[neighs]

33:30.160 --> 33:31.320
Do not stop!

33:31.880 --> 33:33.200
Longbows!

33:34.720 --> 33:35.640
Loose!

33:36.440 --> 33:38.280
[groaning]

33:40.920 --> 33:42.280
[neighs]

33:43.760 --> 33:44.720
Loose!

33:45.640 --> 33:47.480
[groaning]

33:48.080 --> 33:49.000
[neighs]

33:53.080 --> 33:55.040
Retreat! Fall back!

33:55.120 --> 33:56.160
[neighs]

33:57.040 --> 33:58.680
[Hywel] Save yourselves!

33:59.120 --> 34:01.840
-Fire!
-[man] Ready bows!

34:02.200 --> 34:03.040
Loose!

34:03.120 --> 34:04.560
[dramatic vocalizing]

34:04.640 --> 34:05.480
[Hywel] Retreat!

34:07.800 --> 34:09.040
Retreat!

34:09.960 --> 34:11.040
Loose!

34:12.000 --> 34:13.440
[groaning]

34:14.360 --> 34:16.960
[screaming]

34:19.120 --> 34:21.280
Finish them!

34:24.639 --> 34:25.480
[horse grunts]

34:28.760 --> 34:32.080
[screaming continues]

34:42.280 --> 34:43.120
[groans]

35:01.600 --> 35:03.760
[Eardwulf groaning]

35:07.160 --> 35:08.880
[breathing heavily]

35:08.960 --> 35:11.480
[continues groaning]

35:12.760 --> 35:14.120
[chomping]

35:14.600 --> 35:17.800
Good morning. We thought it
a shame to waste your fire and food.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.960
-Seeing as you won't be needing them.
-I can help you.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.880
[all laughing]

35:27.680 --> 35:30.600
I do not need an arse-licker
who will not shut up.

35:30.920 --> 35:35.000
[grunts, chuckles] I don't remember
you laughing at Tettenhall.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.400
You weren't just defeated there.
You were humiliated.

35:39.320 --> 35:41.640
Edward and his army celebrated
a great victory.

35:42.040 --> 35:46.760
[laughs] And they're still celebrating,
eating and drinking and telling tales

35:46.840 --> 35:50.920
of how the Danes were vanquished.
But I can help you put that right.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.680
[breathing heavily]
I know how to defeat Edward.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.960
But if you kill me...
then it goes to the grave with me.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.920
All I'm asking is that you listen
to what I have to say.

36:01.240 --> 36:04.640
And if it's not of value, then kill me.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.240
[chomping] I intend to.

36:18.920 --> 36:22.280
Bring Lady Aethelflaed outside.
She has to see what's happening.

36:22.520 --> 36:23.400
What?

36:23.480 --> 36:25.200
[crowd clamoring]

36:28.760 --> 36:31.280
[cheering]

37:00.440 --> 37:02.560
Your fyrd are here for you,
Lady of Mercia.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.760
Now you have enough men
to fight your brother.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.560
[fyrd cheering]

37:07.840 --> 37:10.200
And what order would you like
to give your army?

37:10.280 --> 37:11.800
[cheering grows]

37:14.840 --> 37:16.560
To remain calm!

37:17.680 --> 37:23.440
I will not sacrifice a single Mercian life
unless it is absolutely necessary.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.360
The fyrd will remain outside.

37:26.760 --> 37:31.520
But I have no doubt that Aegelesburg will
soon be in Mercian control once again.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.680
Open the gates for Lord Uhtred.

37:35.760 --> 37:38.560
There is no need for them
to be closed any longer.

37:39.080 --> 37:42.320
My Lord, open them and you have my word

37:42.400 --> 37:45.640
that the fyrd will not enter the town
without invitation.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.640
There need be no conflict between us.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.120
[dramatic vocalizing]

38:08.400 --> 38:10.400
[cheering]

38:36.800 --> 38:39.560
Come see what our father has done.
You won't believe it.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Where are you going?

38:42.160 --> 38:43.040
To Wessex.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.680
I need time to pray and reflect alone.

38:45.760 --> 38:46.640
Does Father know?

38:46.880 --> 38:50.560
I've made up my mind to go
and I know he will try to stop me.

38:50.640 --> 38:51.760
Why do you have to go?

38:52.440 --> 38:54.800
Father Beocca gave his life to save mine.

38:55.640 --> 38:58.840
The only way I can honor his sacrifice
is by serving God well.

39:00.560 --> 39:03.600
-[sighs] That is what I am doing.
-Take me with you.

39:05.160 --> 39:09.000
-You wish to go to an abbey?
-No, to Wessex, where I can do as I wish.

39:09.240 --> 39:11.560
-[scoffs] And what is it you wish to do?
-Anything.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.200
Because anything is better
than waiting here, bored,

39:14.280 --> 39:16.760
until I'm forced
to marry someone I despise.

39:17.440 --> 39:18.880
I wanna live. That's all.

39:19.280 --> 39:22.840
As much as I would like it,
I cannot take you with me.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.400
But your time will come,
I'm certain of it.

39:28.640 --> 39:29.760
Take care, sister.

39:31.280 --> 39:33.000
You will always be in my thoughts.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.880
[indistinct chatter]

39:52.960 --> 39:54.800
[laughter in distance]

40:09.840 --> 40:11.960
[Edward]
<i>I will let the fyrd into the town.</i>

40:12.160 --> 40:14.880
<i>I can see you have the support</i>
<i>of the people of Mercia.</i>

40:16.040 --> 40:19.360
Enjoy this moment.
It might not always be so.

40:20.040 --> 40:23.320
As ruler, you will have
impossible decisions to make.

40:23.960 --> 40:26.440
I know I've made mistakes
in some of my choices.

40:27.240 --> 40:30.120
As long as I am Lady of Mercia,
you have my support.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.840
I was blind not to see that
you are the right person to rule Mercia.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.400
And for that, I am sorry.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.600
Our alliance is enough for me.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.120
I also wish to discuss East Anglia.

40:45.360 --> 40:49.360
It was conquered by Aethelred,
but since his death, it has grown lawless.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.920
I propose we send an army there

40:52.280 --> 40:55.720
of men from both Wessex
and Mercia to maintain control.

40:55.800 --> 40:56.640
Agreed.

40:57.120 --> 41:00.120
A joint army sends a clear message
that we are allies.

41:00.680 --> 41:03.840
After that, we can push north
into Northumbrian Daneland.

41:04.480 --> 41:09.400
Together, I believe we can achieve
our father's dream of a united land.

41:15.960 --> 41:16.960
[Uhtred sighs]

41:18.520 --> 41:19.360
Pyrlig?

41:21.120 --> 41:22.280
I'm looking for my son.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.320
-He is gone, Uhtred.
-Gone?

41:28.240 --> 41:30.760
-Where?
-Back to his church in Wessex.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.720
-When did he leave?
-He left before dusk.

41:35.600 --> 41:38.640
I suggested he speak to you
before leaving, but he refused.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.000
-Is this because of the baptism?
-No.

41:45.320 --> 41:47.440
It is simply that God has called him away.

41:49.320 --> 41:51.880
I know you do not share his beliefs,
but trust me...

41:52.480 --> 41:54.720
he is a young man you can be proud of.

41:56.600 --> 41:57.560
Will he come back?

41:59.160 --> 42:00.000
I hope so.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.960
I will prepare to return to Coccham.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.840
-You will not stay?
-No.

42:23.720 --> 42:27.280
Staying here and...
seeing you every day...

42:29.840 --> 42:33.960
and not being able to be with you,
it is too painful.

42:37.280 --> 42:42.280
The price we are paying is great,
but it is an oath that I had to make.

42:43.800 --> 42:47.560
[quivering] I will miss you,
Uhtred Ragnarson.

42:49.120 --> 42:51.400
[dramatic vocalizing]

43:06.160 --> 43:09.400
I will always answer Mercia's call
with you on the throne.

43:10.720 --> 43:11.560
I know.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.680
[indistinct chatter]

43:49.120 --> 43:52.240
[Aelswith] It is good to see Aegelesburg
back in Mercian hands.

43:55.120 --> 43:58.840
I wish to talk to you about Aethelstan.

43:59.120 --> 44:01.640
Yes, I am grateful
that you brought him to me.

44:01.880 --> 44:03.680
I know you care about the boy...

44:04.800 --> 44:07.400
but it is impossible
for you to take him to Winchester.

44:07.800 --> 44:10.840
There are people there
that may wish him ill.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.080
If it is agreeable with you,

44:18.880 --> 44:22.160
I would like to take charge of the boy
and take him to Bedwyn

44:22.440 --> 44:24.800
and raise him there, as I raised you.

44:27.600 --> 44:31.040
To follow your footsteps
and those of Alfred's.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.360
Make the arrangements.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.960
I will ask Uhtred to accompany you.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.440
[all giggling]

44:49.320 --> 44:50.320
Come play with us.

44:50.400 --> 44:53.120
[Aethelflaed] In a moment.
First I must talk to Eadith.

44:53.840 --> 44:56.280
[children giggling]

45:04.760 --> 45:08.760
[Aethelflaed] I promised I'd reward you
for delivering my message to Lord Uhtred.

45:10.160 --> 45:11.000
Here it is.

45:11.320 --> 45:14.040
[sighs] Thank you, Lady Aethelflaed.

45:14.840 --> 45:18.680
Aelfwynn enjoys your company
and you have been very loyal to her.

45:20.240 --> 45:21.560
I will not forget that.

45:23.240 --> 45:24.800
But I am the Queen now.

45:25.680 --> 45:29.040
You were my husband's mistress
and your brother killed Aethelred.

45:29.440 --> 45:32.280
To allow you to remain here
would make me look weak.

45:33.720 --> 45:37.680
I do not wish to punish you too harshly.
I will arrange a place for you

45:37.760 --> 45:40.080
at the nunnery,
where you can live and be safe.

45:42.120 --> 45:43.840
I would prefer to find my own way.

45:47.600 --> 45:51.040
-May I say goodbye to Aelfwynn?
-Yes.

46:00.760 --> 46:02.200
[sniffles, chuckles]

46:03.080 --> 46:03.920
[sniffles]

46:11.960 --> 46:15.760
[laughing]

46:19.880 --> 46:23.560
Brida, I did not expect to see you.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.680
You have missed a great victory.

46:28.960 --> 46:31.320
-Have you seen the wisdom of staying here?
-No.

46:31.840 --> 46:34.400
I'm even more certain we must attack
the Saxons now.

46:35.520 --> 46:37.200
I have made my decision, Brida.

46:38.040 --> 46:40.520
And you will change your mind
when you see what I've brought you.

46:41.320 --> 46:43.320
Not unless it is an army of thousands.

46:43.760 --> 46:44.600
[scoffs]

46:54.640 --> 46:55.800
Who is this turd?

46:55.880 --> 46:57.640
[laughs]

46:57.920 --> 47:01.280
He is the turd who will help us
take Winchester...

47:02.240 --> 47:05.160
without a single drop
of Danish blood being shed.

47:07.560 --> 47:09.760
[indistinct chatter]

47:19.120 --> 47:20.400
[object rattles on table]

47:22.280 --> 47:25.040
I know you think we lost out
on wealth and power.

47:27.880 --> 47:31.440
-We have something greater than that.
-Please do not say our friendship.

47:32.120 --> 47:35.280
[all chuckle]

47:37.000 --> 47:40.440
-We need more ale.
-More ale it is, then.

47:47.680 --> 47:49.000
Royal advisor?

47:52.440 --> 47:54.360
Another jug of your strongest ale.

47:57.520 --> 48:01.720
I will pay for your ale.
And when you leave Aegelesburg,

48:01.800 --> 48:04.880
you might allow me to travel with you,
for safe passage.

48:08.560 --> 48:09.440
Then make it two.

48:12.560 --> 48:16.720
After Tettenhall, Edward believes
the Danes no longer hold a threat.

48:17.440 --> 48:20.800
He's taken his army to Aegelesburg,
leaving Winchester undefended.

48:21.200 --> 48:23.720
[Brida] Winchester is King Alfred's
spiritual home.

48:24.520 --> 48:26.760
It's a place of great importance
to the Saxons.

48:26.840 --> 48:29.160
Only a handful of soldiers remain there,
no more than that.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.480
[Brida] We will never get
an opportunity like this again.

48:31.840 --> 48:35.320
Winchester is weak
and nobody realizes except us.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.800
You told me you would not ask your men
to risk death...

48:40.640 --> 48:43.920
unless for food, or land,
or to protect their families.

48:45.240 --> 48:48.440
Winchester provides all things and more.

48:50.120 --> 48:51.200
And there is no risk.

49:19.840 --> 49:22.720
[laughing]

49:38.560 --> 49:41.000
We leave for Winchester today.

49:41.520 --> 49:45.000
-[roaring]
-[all cheering]

49:45.080 --> 49:49.120
[spirited music plays]
