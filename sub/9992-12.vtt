WEBVTT

00:07.214 --> 00:08.173
He just left.

00:08.482 --> 00:09.623
Just had his methadone.

00:10.335 --> 00:12.634
Dark hair, five-11, medium build.

00:13.801 --> 00:15.142
Now, how do I get my money?

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074

01:13.548 --> 01:15.555
What's he saying? What's he screaming about?

01:15.626 --> 01:17.971
What do you think he's saying? He wants to know what we're up to.

01:20.727 --> 01:21.919
You want to know what we're up to?

01:22.440 --> 01:23.634
We're gonna help you kick.

01:24.131 --> 01:25.532
Gonna help you clean up.

01:42.634 --> 01:43.612
¿Acabastes?

01:46.482 --> 01:48.341
¿Acabastes? It's Spanish.

01:48.890 --> 01:51.324
It means, "Are you done?" "Are you through?"

01:53.173 --> 01:54.979
You don't know what "Acabastes" means?

01:56.745 --> 02:00.638
Oh, that's funny, 'cause you've been raving in Spanish for the last ten minutes.

02:01.891 --> 02:02.670
Really?

02:04.999 --> 02:08.055
Well, I don't know what to tell you. I was dreaming, Joe.

02:08.515 --> 02:09.366
Yeah.

02:10.015 --> 02:11.962
But if you don't speak Spanish...

02:13.345 --> 02:16.120
I mean, what, your dreams are subtitled?

02:18.998 --> 02:20.759
Sorry I asked.

03:08.098 --> 03:12.661
And then after school, we can start the model at my house?

03:12.773 --> 03:14.268
Tell him you love him.

03:14.795 --> 03:18.454
That's it! As soon as I get off the phone, I'm going to kill you!

03:18.825 --> 03:21.549
You look scary. You look like a killer sister.

03:21.814 --> 03:24.984
Yeah? No, that's just my little sister.

03:25.282 --> 03:26.792
Say, "I love you, Sean."

03:26.879 --> 03:30.172
I've been talking to my parents about maybe trading her in and getting a dog.

03:30.469 --> 03:31.164
Good morning.

03:31.257 --> 03:34.288
Dad? Are you trading me in for a dog?

03:34.574 --> 03:35.425
Hm?

03:36.524 --> 03:37.400
Ariel.

03:37.515 --> 03:38.727
I'm on the phone.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.344
I'm asking Mom.

03:40.528 --> 03:41.625
She'll know!

03:41.905 --> 03:43.821
It's ten after 7:00. Who are you calling?

03:43.903 --> 03:46.355
Okay, um, I'll see you in class.

03:46.535 --> 03:47.307
Bye.

03:47.979 --> 03:48.885
Who was that?

03:49.335 --> 03:50.481
Sean Bertoni.

03:51.082 --> 03:53.928
He's my, uh, partner for the science fair project.

03:54.036 --> 03:55.542
And her boyfriend!

03:56.366 --> 03:59.749
He's coming over after school so we can start working together.

03:59.959 --> 04:03.216
Science fair, huh? What kind of project are you guys thinking about doing?

04:03.476 --> 04:07.558
Actually, we're thinking of doing something with rockets.

04:07.644 --> 04:09.529
Rockets! I like it.

04:09.691 --> 04:10.993
It was Sean's idea.

04:11.179 --> 04:13.596
Hmm, well, then I think I like Sean Bertoni.

04:14.578 --> 04:17.588
Dad, Mommy's missing! I can't find her anywhere!

04:17.716 --> 04:18.974
No, she's fine.

04:19.154 --> 04:20.951
Stop yelling. You'll wake your sister.

04:21.350 --> 04:22.600
But, Dad...

04:23.000 --> 04:27.767
I can't find her, and if I can't find her, how are we apposed to get to school?

04:27.833 --> 04:30.346
I'm gonna take you to school. Mom had to go into work early.

04:30.490 --> 04:34.494
Something came up, something very special came up, and Mom had to go into work extra early.

04:36.071 --> 04:37.253
The lucky stiff.

04:39.956 --> 04:43.470
And that one's for Mrs. Dubois, courtesy of the Mayor's Office.

04:43.552 --> 04:46.096
All we ask is that you avoid any contact with the press.

04:46.169 --> 04:50.080
If you do get buttonholed by someone, just please, steer them over to me.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.150
Have you ever attended one of these before?

04:53.899 --> 04:55.706
State execution? No.

04:55.789 --> 04:56.792
It was my idea--

04:56.955 --> 05:02.179
Mrs. Dubois has been doing a lot of work as a jury consultant for my office in capital punishment cases,

05:02.235 --> 05:05.875
and I thought if she was gonna have a hand in ending someone's life,

05:05.968 --> 05:08.149
it was important that she see, um...

05:08.681 --> 05:09.808
The end result?

05:10.196 --> 05:12.147
I'll be curious to see what you think.

05:12.270 --> 05:18.040
For me, the event itself is... always surprisingly matter-of-fact.

05:19.075 --> 05:23.483
And then the memory of it, it stays with you for the rest of your life.

05:33.838 --> 05:35.961
I have to say, I'm impressed you're going through with this.

05:36.054 --> 05:40.334
You might want to hold that thought till after in case I pass out or throw up or something.

05:40.416 --> 05:41.556
You wouldn't be the first.

05:42.150 --> 05:46.657
Just keep in mind, people like Reynaldo Cerrera are the reason the death penalty exists.

05:46.775 --> 05:48.501
I prosecuted the man myself.

05:48.847 --> 05:52.858
Guilty of four counts of murder, including the shooting death of a seven-year-old girl,

05:52.944 --> 05:57.296
who happened to be walking down the street during a drive-by attack by a rival drug gang.

05:57.538 --> 06:00.286
And the four counts are just what I could link to him directly.

06:00.502 --> 06:02.786
God knows how many other murders he ordered.

06:02.868 --> 06:05.550
Or how many people died because of the junk he was peddling.

06:07.679 --> 06:11.878
Everyone's entitled to their opinion, of course, but if you ask me, lethal injection

06:11.986 --> 06:15.943
is too gentle, too civilized an ending for an animal like Cerrera.

06:19.988 --> 06:20.864
That's funny.

06:21.095 --> 06:21.694
What's that?

06:21.761 --> 06:25.135
Don't you usually call in the coroner when there's a question about the cause of death?

06:25.216 --> 06:27.366
Seems today would be a foregone conclusion.

06:27.740 --> 06:30.956
Well, they're not really coroners, they're the drivers.

06:31.032 --> 06:34.570
They're here to transport the remains to the Medical Examiner's Office.

06:34.693 --> 06:38.847
State requires that we do an autopsy before we hand over the body to the family.

06:39.347 --> 06:41.042
We're nothing if not thorough.

06:45.845 --> 06:47.263
He  looks so calm.

06:48.661 --> 06:50.284
They're given a sedative.

06:50.942 --> 06:54.272
Reynaldo Cerrera, do you have any final words?

06:55.568 --> 06:57.308
No final ones.

06:58.317 --> 06:59.152
No.

07:58.205 --> 07:59.036
So?

07:59.174 --> 08:01.539
So that woman from the Mayor's Office was right.

08:02.102 --> 08:05.205
It's odd. It was weirdly undramatic.

08:05.789 --> 08:08.001
I'm more surprised by what I didn't feel.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.001
He was a very bad man.

08:12.625 --> 08:16.101
It sounds harsh, but I don't think a life of any value was lost here today.

08:16.393 --> 08:19.075
You must be right-- he must have been empty, soulless.

08:19.163 --> 08:20.386
At least I couldn't see it.

08:21.490 --> 08:22.690
What do you mean?

08:23.453 --> 08:26.207
I've never been to an execution before, but normally,

08:26.279 --> 08:29.531
when I go to a funeral or if someone passes in the hospital,

08:29.955 --> 08:32.577
I see their soul, I see their spirit.

08:33.375 --> 08:34.293
But today...

08:35.039 --> 08:36.145
there was nothing.

08:37.236 --> 08:38.491
He must've had none.

08:42.058 --> 08:44.573
Well, it's time to rejoin the living.

08:45.053 --> 08:47.174
Oh, which reminds me, when we get back to the office,

08:47.246 --> 08:50.006
could I look through the current missing- persons reports?

08:50.078 --> 08:51.219
Why, you lose somebody?

08:51.460 --> 08:55.448
Well, this is gonna shock and amaze you, but last night I had the craziest dream.

08:55.873 --> 08:58.085
You? How is that possible?

09:00.666 --> 09:01.735
What the hell?

09:02.504 --> 09:05.892
Oh, God, it's 3:00 in the morning.

09:12.470 --> 09:13.562
Hello?

09:13.686 --> 09:15.544
Allison, it's Lee Scanlon.

09:15.670 --> 09:17.014
I'm sorry to call so late.

09:17.459 --> 09:19.431
I'm at a murder scene, and, uh...

09:20.635 --> 09:23.096
I  was wondering if I could send a car to bring you downtown?

09:23.234 --> 09:25.584
Detective Scanlon, it's the middle of the night.

09:26.037 --> 09:27.049
Yeah, I know.

09:27.889 --> 09:29.906
Normally I wouldn't bother you, but...

09:30.352 --> 09:35.129
I got a dead woman, and I got a witness, and the witness says he knows who did it.

09:36.128 --> 09:39.122
And I couldn't think of anyone else who might be able to make sense of what he's saying.

09:39.895 --> 09:42.389
I'm sorry. I don't understand. What are you talking about?

09:42.516 --> 09:48.093
Well... the witness is telling me the killer was a ghost.

09:53.834 --> 09:55.086
Can you state your name, please?

09:55.557 --> 09:57.411
Why are we taping this, and who's she?

09:57.944 --> 10:01.142
The agreement I made with your attorney was that I would defer making a decision

10:01.183 --> 10:03.909
on whether or not to book you until you made an on-the-record statement

10:03.965 --> 10:05.229
of your version of what happened.

10:05.348 --> 10:06.668
She's not a shrink, is she?

10:06.955 --> 10:08.758
She's with the District Attorney's office.

10:08.824 --> 10:11.364
They have to weigh in whether to charge you, as well.

10:12.869 --> 10:14.557
Well, what difference does it make?

10:15.485 --> 10:17.853
- I'm a dead man, right?
- Mr. Ramirez, please.

10:18.135 --> 10:20.973
I'm trying to help you here. I'm trying to keep you out of jail.

10:21.066 --> 10:22.392
What difference does it make?

10:23.303 --> 10:24.849
He'll just kill me in jail.

10:25.140 --> 10:26.954
He'll find me wherever I am, right?

10:28.792 --> 10:31.520
Mr. Ramirez, are you aware that right now

10:31.572 --> 10:34.281
you are the primary suspect in the murder of Lorena Vasquez?

10:34.370 --> 10:38.274
And until I have your statement to evaluate, you will remain the primary suspect?

10:42.853 --> 10:44.109
Let's start with your name, please.

10:49.964 --> 10:51.545
My name is Steven Ramirez.

10:51.709 --> 10:53.169
You want to tell us what you do for a living?

10:57.975 --> 10:59.241
I'm a businessman.

11:00.218 --> 11:01.355
An entrepreneur.

11:01.703 --> 11:05.569
Would it be fair to say that you're involved in many of the same businesses as Rey Cerrera?

11:06.060 --> 11:07.494
Rey Cerrera was an animal.

11:09.142 --> 11:10.412
Is an animal.

11:10.864 --> 11:12.665
I own a legitimate business.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.142
I'm involved in facilitating imports and exports.

11:17.494 --> 11:18.763
Obviously, we...

11:19.280 --> 11:22.603
we had a number of enterprises that competed for the same market share.

11:24.042 --> 11:29.177
Now... according to this report, police responded to shots being fired at the former home

11:29.240 --> 11:32.752
of your business rival, the late Rey Cerrera, and found you attempting to flee the scene.

11:33.714 --> 11:37.144
They also discovered the body of Lorena Vasquez,

11:37.247 --> 11:38.758
a woman thought to be Cerrera's girlfriend.

11:38.853 --> 11:42.187
I'm guessing she's another area where you and Rey "competed"?

11:45.725 --> 11:46.677
She loved me.

11:48.992 --> 11:50.109
And I loved her.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.447
And I guess...

11:55.464 --> 11:57.252
I guess he wasn't ready to give her up.

11:59.955 --> 12:01.209
And now he doesn't have to.

12:05.576 --> 12:07.292
All right, let's start from the beginning.

12:08.080 --> 12:11.198
You and Lorena were in the hot tub. I'm guessing from all the champagne bottles we found

12:11.254 --> 12:12.735
that you were celebrating.

12:15.781 --> 12:16.810
Rey was dead.

12:19.074 --> 12:21.074
It was the beginning of a new day for us.

12:22.355 --> 12:25.938
And we were out there, in the hot tub.

12:26.410 --> 12:27.798
It was a beautiful night.

12:28.467 --> 12:29.353
It was perfect.

12:29.774 --> 12:30.840
She was so happy.

12:31.423 --> 12:33.256
She said she wanted some more champagne...

12:36.210 --> 12:37.177
My God.

12:39.148 --> 12:40.316
She was so beautiful.

12:51.874 --> 12:53.255
And then I heard it.

12:53.705 --> 12:54.703
First the scream...

12:55.851 --> 12:57.131
And then the crash.

12:59.809 --> 13:01.032
And then I saw someone.

13:02.301 --> 13:03.970
I saw someone inside the house.

13:06.179 --> 13:07.969
And this, this, this didn't make any sense.

13:08.026 --> 13:11.353
And this house, I mean, it... it's built like a fort, right?

13:12.096 --> 13:13.955
Then I felt his presence.

13:14.201 --> 13:18.102
I looked up, and that's when I saw him, Rey Cerrera.

13:18.178 --> 13:20.908
I started firing, and I just kept on firing.

13:22.884 --> 13:23.821
And he was gone.

13:26.924 --> 13:28.813
He came back from the dead to kill her.

13:29.797 --> 13:31.317
And now that he knows about us,

13:32.705 --> 13:34.225
he'll come back again...

13:35.435 --> 13:36.447
to kill me.

13:46.299 --> 13:49.564
Oh, boy, school! Yay!

13:49.652 --> 13:51.090
Oh,  my goodness, here comes Sean!

13:51.274 --> 13:53.470
Hey, maybe he's going to propose!

13:53.557 --> 13:54.802
Bridgette! Shh.

13:55.705 --> 13:56.902
Hi, Sean!

13:56.979 --> 13:58.669
Hey, Ariel. Hey, Bridgette.

13:59.093 --> 14:00.747
I finished the nose cone last night.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.210
Wow. That looks great.

14:04.530 --> 14:06.757
Sean, this is my mother.

14:07.296 --> 14:08.816
Hi,  Sean. Nice to meet you.

14:10.601 --> 14:13.054
Mommy? Mommy, why?

14:14.505 --> 14:15.953
It's nice to meet you, too.

14:17.531 --> 14:19.732
I was just filled with this sense of dread.

14:19.830 --> 14:21.826
It just became so clear to me.

14:22.348 --> 14:23.845
He's gonna do something.

14:24.329 --> 14:26.556
He's gonna hurt her, he just is.

14:26.701 --> 14:28.532
We're talking about a ten-year-old boy here.

14:28.604 --> 14:31.258
I mean, they're working on a science fair project together,

14:31.309 --> 14:33.392
not going to Florida for spring break.

14:33.576 --> 14:34.790
How can he possibly hurt her?

14:34.867 --> 14:37.815
I don't know. I'm just telling you what I saw, I'm just...

14:38.318 --> 14:39.843
I'm telling you what I felt.

14:40.074 --> 14:42.869
Well, I think you've got to be a little suspicious about anything you might be feeling

14:42.925 --> 14:46.131
after watching a man being put to death and then staying out half the night.

14:46.817 --> 14:48.195
And what are you doing on the phone?

14:48.301 --> 14:50.059
Aren't you supposed to be at home, catching a nap?

14:50.366 --> 14:52.255
I tried. I couldn't sleep.

14:53.488 --> 14:56.786
I just... felt I needed to tell you.

14:57.768 --> 15:00.507
Can you hold on a second? I'm getting another call.

15:01.854 --> 15:02.636
Hello?

15:02.724 --> 15:05.173
Allison? The District Attorney asked me to call

15:05.234 --> 15:08.104
to see if you could meet him at the courthouse in about an hour.

15:08.203 --> 15:09.213
An hour?

15:10.107 --> 15:10.968
Yeah, sure.

15:11.147 --> 15:12.349
They got coffee there?

15:13.794 --> 15:14.567
Manuel!

15:15.883 --> 15:16.974
Thanks for coming here.

15:17.409 --> 15:20.430
I would have happily come to your place, but I'm locked into a trial and...

15:20.506 --> 15:23.497
You're a busy man, Larry. We get it. Now what are we doing here?

15:23.644 --> 15:27.731
Well, something's come up with regard to the Ramirez case,

15:27.818 --> 15:30.572
the death of that poor Lorena Vasquez that I wanted to share with you,

15:30.634 --> 15:33.045
in private, as a professional courtesy.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.278
You are familiar with the case?

15:35.814 --> 15:40.829
You mean the one in which your client, a notorious drug lord, was found at the scene of a murder

15:40.901 --> 15:44.833
and claimed with an absolute straight face that it was actually committed by a man

15:44.899 --> 15:48.329
that both Mrs. Dubois and I watched being put to death earlier in the day?

15:49.195 --> 15:50.049
Vaguely.

15:50.444 --> 15:51.166
Good.

15:52.064 --> 15:54.344
Now, if you read my client's statement, you would have taken note of the fact

15:54.440 --> 15:58.974
that he snapped a picture with his phone of the late Ms. Vasquez's, um...

15:59.850 --> 16:03.812
behind only a minute or so before Rey Cerrera killed her?

16:03.880 --> 16:04.806
Oh, yes.

16:05.026 --> 16:06.941
I was nearly brought to tears as I read about it.

16:07.013 --> 16:09.706
Clearly, your client is quite the romantic.

16:09.777 --> 16:12.706
Now, well, what he failed to mention was that he sent that picture

16:12.788 --> 16:15.067
via cell phone to a business associate.

16:15.154 --> 16:15.865
Of course he did.

16:15.952 --> 16:18.303
And I wanted to make you aware of the fact that I'm planning

16:18.349 --> 16:22.117
on introducing Mr. Ramirez's cell phone records to establish the date and time

16:22.188 --> 16:24.903
of the photo's creation as well as its transmission.

16:25.368 --> 16:28.614
Are you trying to tell me that a photo your client took of this woman's...

16:29.007 --> 16:31.753
tush is somehow gonna convince me not to file charges?

16:31.824 --> 16:33.239
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

16:34.645 --> 16:37.161
By the way, I'm glad you're involved with this case, Mrs. Dubois,

16:37.226 --> 16:39.642
because I believe that your expertise in this area

16:39.710 --> 16:42.648
is going to prove most helpful to the District Attorney.

16:48.728 --> 16:50.025
Go  ahead, take a look.

16:50.532 --> 16:54.374
It looks like a photo from Rumpshaker that didn't make the cut.

16:54.465 --> 16:55.484
Look closer.

16:55.915 --> 16:56.990
In the background.

17:02.244 --> 17:03.667
All right, what's that?

17:04.131 --> 17:05.505
Don't you mean who's that?

17:06.317 --> 17:08.817
I took the liberty of having the photo enhanced.

17:09.138 --> 17:10.056
Blown up.

17:10.429 --> 17:11.419
Cleaned up.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.132
Take a look.

17:17.650 --> 17:18.960
This man is dead.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.888
And I can personally attest to the fact that he had been dead

17:21.940 --> 17:24.140
at least 12 hours before this woman was murdered.

17:24.218 --> 17:25.381
Pictures don't lie, Manny.

17:25.463 --> 17:28.641
No, but people do all the time, and they've even been known to use pictures to do it.

17:28.703 --> 17:30.127
This has been doctored.

17:31.003 --> 17:33.264
It's obviously doctored. It proves nothing.

17:33.557 --> 17:36.592
Why don't you let your techs look at it, see what they have to say?

17:37.085 --> 17:39.400
In fact, why don't you send it to the FBI?

17:39.497 --> 17:40.362
We will.

17:42.890 --> 17:44.631
Go ahead, tell him it's not a fake.

17:46.101 --> 17:47.305
I don't know that.

17:47.546 --> 17:48.431
Really?

17:49.006 --> 17:50.992
Well, then, you disappoint me, Mrs. Dubois.

17:51.806 --> 17:53.706
By the way, one piece of bad news:

17:53.796 --> 17:57.499
Somehow a copy of this photo got leaked to the press.

17:58.594 --> 18:00.012
Those damn vultures.

18:01.985 --> 18:06.105
Manuel, I'm going to let you take some time to mull things over.

18:06.542 --> 18:10.017
Unfortunately, I need these back.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.816
But don't worry, if you want to see them,

18:14.430 --> 18:17.042
you can just check 'em out on the front page of the paper.

18:33.300 --> 18:38.012
Little boy, remember I told you I was gonna offer your mother a choice?

18:38.106 --> 18:40.649
And that if she made the one choice, it would be good for you,

18:40.799 --> 18:43.429
and if she made the other choice it would be bad for you?

18:43.681 --> 18:46.872
Well, I'm sorry to say, she made the wrong choice.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.902
So, now, we have to change her thinking.

18:50.010 --> 18:53.384
Now, this nice man is gonna hold you.

18:53.620 --> 18:54.956
Now, don't get upset.

18:55.057 --> 18:57.578
I'm not making this happen. Your mother is making this happen.

18:58.462 --> 18:59.784
- Come on.
- No!

19:00.000 --> 19:01.575
This will only hurt for a little while.

19:02.212 --> 19:04.770
Besides, who needs a pinky anyway?

19:04.837 --> 19:05.862
What are they good for?

19:06.179 --> 19:07.431
- Let's count to three.
- No!

19:07.472 --> 19:09.215
One... Two...

19:18.242 --> 19:20.714
And his mom is so cool. She camps!

19:20.802 --> 19:23.612
He says they've been camping all of their lives, and she said that maybe

19:23.669 --> 19:25.967
the next time they go on a camping trip, our families could go, too!

19:26.029 --> 19:27.657
Wouldn't that be amazing?

19:27.913 --> 19:29.251
What do you mean?

19:29.577 --> 19:30.940
Sleep on the ground?

19:31.247 --> 19:32.250
On the dirt?

19:33.769 --> 19:36.644
Ariel, I think I need to talk to you about something.

19:36.909 --> 19:40.115
Uh, Al, I think I need to talk to you about something first.

19:42.655 --> 19:46.223
Okay. You had a dream the other night about a guy being kidnapped, right?

19:46.280 --> 19:46.637
Joe...

19:46.693 --> 19:48.749
Ah, you went into work, no one was missing.

19:48.829 --> 19:49.320
Joe...

19:49.378 --> 19:50.969
Ah. I'm trying to make a point here.

19:51.409 --> 19:52.848
Any dreams last night?

19:52.940 --> 19:54.978
Actually, yes, there was a little boy...

19:55.049 --> 19:56.150
What, murdered, kidnapped?

19:56.447 --> 19:57.921
Kidnapped, I think.

19:58.321 --> 20:01.332
Funny, 'cause I didn't hear a word about a missing kid on TV just now.

20:01.890 --> 20:02.980
Listen, well, maybe...

20:03.061 --> 20:04.655
Uh, maybe it hasn't happened yet, maybe...

20:04.726 --> 20:08.413
maybe the kid is just a symbol for something, and maybe... just maybe you're wrong.

20:08.510 --> 20:12.596
And maybe... just maybe you're wrong about this Sean kid, too.

20:13.129 --> 20:15.775
I saw your face out there. You're convinced this is going to end badly for Ariel,

20:15.828 --> 20:18.217
and you're convinced that you have to do something about it.

20:18.336 --> 20:19.837
So now you're reading my mind?

20:19.969 --> 20:23.046
Uh, no, Allison. Actually, I'm pleading with you. Just leave it alone.

20:23.124 --> 20:23.947
Well, if I know...

20:24.028 --> 20:26.850
But you don't know. You don't know that she isn't going to break his heart.

20:27.362 --> 20:30.041
You don't know that they're not going to win the science fair and have a friendship

20:30.087 --> 20:32.815
that lasts the rest of their lives. You don't know that this boy

20:32.989 --> 20:35.932
and whatever joy-- and yes, maybe pain-- he brings,

20:36.010 --> 20:38.878
is going to contribute in some really important way to making Ariel

20:38.928 --> 20:40.291
who  she's supposed to become.

20:46.015 --> 20:47.484
What are you guys doing?

20:47.996 --> 20:48.918
We're talking.

20:49.690 --> 20:50.642
Who's on the phone?

20:50.766 --> 20:53.336
It's, uh, Sean's mom. She called for you.

20:57.392 --> 20:58.148
Hello?

20:59.657 --> 21:01.338
Nice to meet you, too.

21:02.844 --> 21:05.424
Coffee? After we take the kids to school?

21:06.690 --> 21:09.326
Sure. Sounds great.

21:10.115 --> 21:11.728
Ariel's a terrific kid.

21:11.815 --> 21:13.385
Sean's really taken with her.

21:13.796 --> 21:16.269
I haven't had a chance to spend any real time with him,

21:16.336 --> 21:19.633
but my husband wants to adopt him and my daughter wants to marry him,

21:19.710 --> 21:21.399
so there you have it.

21:21.487 --> 21:23.447
I'm just happy Sean's made a friend.

21:23.918 --> 21:25.249
We move around a lot.

21:25.336 --> 21:26.809
Mostly because of my job.

21:27.417 --> 21:29.340
And it's not always easy for him.

21:30.222 --> 21:33.815
Well, who knows, maybe this time you'll be able to stick around for a while.

21:37.101 --> 21:38.829
Oh, my God. What is this?

21:46.693 --> 21:47.706
Are you all right?

21:52.509 --> 21:54.423
- Yes, Officer?
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

21:54.602 --> 21:56.553
May I please see your license and registration?

21:58.121 --> 22:02.113
Everything's all right, Officer? I wasn't breaking any laws?

22:02.216 --> 22:03.363
Broken tail light.

22:07.528 --> 22:08.677
Be back in a moment.

22:14.322 --> 22:16.639
License and registration, please?

22:30.436 --> 22:31.564
Thanks, Melissa.

22:33.208 --> 22:36.608
You two wouldn't happen to have been anywhere near Hollister today, would you?

22:36.838 --> 22:38.277
I don't even know where that is.

22:38.983 --> 22:41.395
Had a robbery in a pharmacy over there.

22:41.769 --> 22:43.822
You wouldn't know anything about that now, would you?

22:44.569 --> 22:45.526
No, sir.

22:48.660 --> 22:49.938
That your boyfriend there?

22:51.434 --> 22:52.596
You want to wake him up?

22:53.704 --> 22:55.039
Not sure I can.

22:56.013 --> 22:57.252
Pretty trashed, huh?

22:59.848 --> 23:01.306
God, you're good looking.

23:07.896 --> 23:09.734
Stay right there.

23:10.825 --> 23:12.232
I'll be back in a moment.

23:21.033 --> 23:24.127
Wake up! Wake... up!

23:41.226 --> 23:43.439
Oh, my goodness.

23:44.561 --> 23:47.593
We have a problem, Melissa. Big problem.

23:48.268 --> 23:51.167
Seems this car comes fairly close to matching

23:51.294 --> 23:54.997
the description of the vehicle used in that robbery in Hollister.

23:55.949 --> 23:59.533
Now I explained to them that I had just interviewed you,

23:59.911 --> 24:04.416
and I convinced them to give me sole discretion on whether or not to detain you.

24:05.498 --> 24:08.262
But I am going to need you to step out of the car.

24:14.321 --> 24:20.305
Melissa, I'm gonna need you to turn around and put your hands on top of the vehicle.

24:27.519 --> 24:28.598
What are you doing?

24:30.505 --> 24:32.091
This is called a pat down.

24:33.177 --> 24:34.763
What's the matter? My hands cold?

24:38.757 --> 24:39.847
Do me a favor.

24:41.241 --> 24:43.421
Just bend over a little more.

24:43.555 --> 24:45.126
Can you do that for me, please?

25:00.871 --> 25:02.729
Oh, my God, what is that?

25:05.003 --> 25:06.437
What do you think it is?

25:08.074 --> 25:12.360
Don't pretend that you've never had one of those back there before.

25:12.467 --> 25:15.571
Listen, I'm eight weeks pregnant.

25:17.496 --> 25:21.596
All the more reason for me to conduct this investigation from behind.

25:26.860 --> 25:34.079
Now... how about you undo your jeans?

25:50.026 --> 25:51.047
My God.

25:51.202 --> 25:52.880
Now give me my keys.

25:55.311 --> 25:56.506
Take it easy.

26:05.285 --> 26:06.264
Let it go, girl!

26:12.491 --> 26:16.105
Sarah, you have a spotless record, so I'm gonna let you go with a warning.

26:16.207 --> 26:18.404
But let's get that light fixed pronto, okay?

26:18.481 --> 26:20.005
Absolutely. Thank you.

26:37.838 --> 26:38.842
I need to see him.

26:38.970 --> 26:40.246
Now is not a good time.

26:43.249 --> 26:43.988
Good morning.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.033
Says you.

26:54.034 --> 26:55.370
Did I ask you to come in today?

26:55.776 --> 26:56.614
No. I...

26:56.708 --> 26:57.761
You happen to see the morning paper?

26:58.627 --> 27:03.147
No. My daughter's friend's mother called and that's what I'm here to talk to you about.

27:04.197 --> 27:05.922
Catchy headline, don't you think?

27:06.911 --> 27:09.874
The Mayor's Office and the police department are being flooded with calls.

27:09.962 --> 27:14.457
People are suddenly claiming to have seen the ghost of Reynaldo Cerrera all over town...

27:14.642 --> 27:16.874
riding in cabs, eating in restaurants,

27:17.269 --> 27:19.613
power walking in the mall.

27:19.809 --> 27:21.749
You didn't happen to see him on the way over, did you?

27:23.142 --> 27:24.667
Well, let me ask you a crude question.

27:24.734 --> 27:26.797
If all these other people are seeing him, why aren't you?

27:27.346 --> 27:29.429
I don't see people just because they're dead.

27:29.501 --> 27:30.740
They have to seek me out.

27:31.016 --> 27:33.525
The only other time it happens is if I'm at a funeral

27:33.735 --> 27:36.807
or if I'm at the grave site and the spirit happens to be there.

27:36.889 --> 27:38.932
Would you like me to visit Cerrera's grave?

27:39.153 --> 27:41.348
Doesn't exist. Family cremated him.

27:44.099 --> 27:46.203
Any way I could go back into the prison?

27:46.284 --> 27:47.478
On the other side of the glass?

27:47.544 --> 27:49.013
Where he was actually executed?

27:49.147 --> 27:50.617
Maybe I could get something there.

27:51.035 --> 27:52.035
Let me make a call.

28:26.968 --> 28:27.776
Hey.

28:29.856 --> 28:31.970
That's a cool yo-yo you got there.

28:42.466 --> 28:44.293
So what happened to your finger?

28:45.873 --> 28:46.798
Can I help you?

28:51.807 --> 28:53.633
I didn't speak to her, Mom.

28:53.756 --> 28:55.769
I didn't speak to the stranger.

28:55.865 --> 28:57.073
I know. Go inside.

28:59.619 --> 29:00.618
Can I help you?

29:00.894 --> 29:01.862
That's okay.

29:03.556 --> 29:06.531
Just trying to find my way out of this maze.

29:29.364 --> 29:30.647
What's he yammering about?

29:30.744 --> 29:32.842
Food. He wants food.

29:32.946 --> 29:35.013
Tell him no. There's no food.

29:35.152 --> 29:37.456
We can't feed him 'til we know what Cerrera had to eat.

29:37.558 --> 29:38.750
Tell him to show me the tattoo.

29:43.617 --> 29:45.152
It's healing very nice.

29:45.448 --> 29:46.944
You have very good taste.

29:57.757 --> 29:58.888
Buenas noches.

29:59.904 --> 30:02.083
You were doing it again. The Spanish thing.

30:02.186 --> 30:03.769
I'm sorry. I was dreaming.

30:03.916 --> 30:05.986
Me, too. You were Salma Hayek.

30:07.398 --> 30:10.112
Please, Joe, this is serious.

30:11.116 --> 30:12.610
I saw that guy again.

30:12.831 --> 30:14.178
The one that was kidnapped?

30:14.367 --> 30:16.353
They were giving him Cerrera's tattoos,

30:16.931 --> 30:19.241
making him eat what Cerrera ate.

30:19.337 --> 30:26.117
It was... it was as if they were getting him ready to be Cerrera.

30:27.381 --> 30:30.515
You know what you need? You need to talk to Cerrera's ghost.

30:31.606 --> 30:34.662
That'd be nice, but he's not talking.

30:38.798 --> 30:41.636
And what do I do about Ariel's friend?

30:41.989 --> 30:44.362
I don't know that there's anything to do.

30:45.792 --> 30:47.622
His mother killed a cop.

30:47.990 --> 30:51.098
A bad cop, but the fact is, she killed him.

30:52.879 --> 30:55.183
No wonder she's such a good camper.

30:55.566 --> 30:58.491
No wonder she's always moving them from town to town.

31:00.764 --> 31:02.996
I hate that I know this.

31:03.530 --> 31:06.170
I hate that I have to do something about this.

31:06.339 --> 31:08.282
Well, as long as we're talking about hates...

31:08.379 --> 31:11.036
I hate that I have to remind you that you don't know this, you think it.

31:11.491 --> 31:14.148
Until you know it, you don't have to do anything about it.

31:14.363 --> 31:15.930
In fact, you probably shouldn't.

31:18.290 --> 31:19.944
Can I make a suggestion?

31:20.072 --> 31:22.049
You talking to me or you talking to Salma?

31:22.596 --> 31:26.128
Before you go to the authorities and turn this woman's life upside down,

31:26.836 --> 31:30.368
not to mention destroy a friendship that's pretty damn important to your daughter,

31:31.013 --> 31:35.034
isn't there some subtle way that you could broach the subject with the woman herself?

31:35.442 --> 31:38.924
Just test her reaction before you go running to the D.A.

31:43.886 --> 31:44.905
I suppose so.

31:48.410 --> 31:49.300
Melissa!

31:49.777 --> 31:51.286
Melissa Banks?

31:52.747 --> 31:54.679
That's your real name, isn't it?

31:55.380 --> 31:57.531
I'm sorry to ambush you like this,

31:57.761 --> 31:59.277
but we have a problem.

31:59.738 --> 32:01.741
I know who you really are.

32:01.964 --> 32:03.614
I know what you've done.

32:03.854 --> 32:06.604
And I work for the District Attorney's office.

32:09.742 --> 32:12.661
It might actually be a blessing, you know...

32:13.408 --> 32:16.084
not having to move around, getting it all out...

32:16.884 --> 32:18.098
going to trial.

32:19.880 --> 32:23.055
I'm betting that when people hear your side of the story...

32:40.566 --> 32:41.103
Yeah?

32:42.522 --> 32:43.565
Yeah, put her through.

32:44.005 --> 32:44.974
Yes, Allison?

32:45.102 --> 32:46.905
I need to discuss something with you.

32:47.053 --> 32:49.510
It's about a crime that happened over a decade ago.

32:49.572 --> 32:52.755
Well, if it held for a decade, it's just going to have to hold a little while longer.

32:52.838 --> 32:55.538
If it's not about the Cerrera case, I don't want to hear it.

32:55.633 --> 32:58.009
I just got the DNA back from the murder scene.

32:58.773 --> 33:03.427
The skin under Lorena Vasquez's nails, the tiny remnants of saliva on her neck,

33:03.514 --> 33:05.122
the stray hairs on her body...

33:05.706 --> 33:09.224
they all belong to the late Reynaldo Cerrera.

33:09.950 --> 33:12.304
Did you ever heard of that? A ghost leaving DNA behind?

33:12.392 --> 33:14.118
No, I can't say I have.

33:14.199 --> 33:17.011
I think I'm going to have to withdraw the charges against Ramirez.

33:17.383 --> 33:20.277
The only question is, who do I file them against, a dead man?

33:20.358 --> 33:23.103
I'm sorry. I feel like I've really let you down on this one.

33:23.180 --> 33:24.675
Well, it's not you.

33:25.176 --> 33:29.653
Something crazy happened at that house that night, and maybe we'll never really know what.

33:29.847 --> 33:32.641
Listen, would it be possible for me to go out there?

33:33.006 --> 33:35.637
Well... it's a crime scene.

33:35.718 --> 33:38.735
I'm sure the police are still there. Just mention that you're with my office.

33:38.807 --> 33:39.912
Why? What are you thinking?

33:39.996 --> 33:42.720
I don't know. It seems like everyone's running into that ghost but me.

33:42.796 --> 33:44.818
Maybe it's time I made a house call.

33:45.586 --> 33:47.618
You, uh, looking for anything specific?

33:47.832 --> 33:51.612
No. Just helpful to see where it all happened, soak it in.

34:16.007 --> 34:17.016
Excuse me.

34:17.969 --> 34:19.521
Do you mind if I use this phone?

34:20.643 --> 34:22.568
You think it's okay to use this phone?

34:22.659 --> 34:24.170
Yeah, I think it's all right.

34:31.800 --> 34:32.731
Thanks.

34:55.415 --> 34:56.641
It's a safe room.

34:56.909 --> 34:58.013
A panic room.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.337
See this phone?

35:00.711 --> 35:02.355
It connects only to one person.

35:02.483 --> 35:03.214
My brother.

35:04.013 --> 35:07.655
There's enough food and water to live in here for almost two weeks without having to come out.

35:08.005 --> 35:09.937
And if anyone manages to get in the house,

35:10.061 --> 35:12.912
you'll see them on one of these TV screens.

35:16.348 --> 35:17.290
See this?

35:17.782 --> 35:19.046
Eight inches thick.

35:19.231 --> 35:21.618
No bullet can get through the door or the walls.

35:22.010 --> 35:25.231
Plus, no one-- and I mean no one in the world-- knows about it.

35:25.543 --> 35:27.582
The man who designed it and built it for me,

35:27.673 --> 35:30.495
he met with an unfortunate end shortly after finishing it.

35:31.110 --> 35:33.111
But I don't get it, baby.

35:34.042 --> 35:35.634
Why are you showing me this?

35:37.417 --> 35:38.826
I got a lot of enemies.

35:40.463 --> 35:44.284
And I'm going to prison for a very long time and maybe never coming back.

35:45.159 --> 35:49.454
I want to know that if someone tries to get to me through you,

35:49.952 --> 35:53.986
you've got somewhere safe to be until help is on the way.

36:00.225 --> 36:03.872
Well, actually I did make contact with a ghost. It just wasn't Cerrera's.

36:04.078 --> 36:06.388
Well, what would you like me to do? Should I send backup?

36:06.489 --> 36:07.825
Do you need more cops down there?

36:08.000 --> 36:12.607
No, actually, I was hoping to persuade you to do the opposite, maybe get everyone out of here.

36:50.162 --> 36:51.003
Freeze!

36:53.542 --> 36:56.363
I know you're a ghost, so this will sound silly, but drop that briefcase

36:56.414 --> 36:59.677
and put your hands on your head or these men will gladly kill you a second time.

37:03.885 --> 37:05.584
You have the right to remain silent.

37:05.790 --> 37:08.979
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

37:09.307 --> 37:10.899
You have the right to counsel.

37:11.124 --> 37:12.768
If you are unable to retain counsel, counsel...

37:12.850 --> 37:16.567
What is... what is Pancuronium and Adenosine?

37:16.674 --> 37:18.610
Pancuronium and Adenosine?

37:18.856 --> 37:22.312
When injected in the right combination, they would stop both the lungs and the heart,

37:22.378 --> 37:25.026
but only for a few seconds at a time.

37:25.122 --> 37:26.080
Of course.

37:26.295 --> 37:29.310
You only need a few seconds to be pronounced dead.

37:31.324 --> 37:36.346
Okay, so the trick would be to find someone you really trust

37:36.438 --> 37:39.024
to substitute the drugs and administer them.

37:39.592 --> 37:45.574
And suppose that people in your organization are holding someone's little boy hostage.

37:45.866 --> 37:48.772
Well, then you could trust that they're gonna do what you want.

37:49.873 --> 37:51.814
So that got you out the door.

37:52.561 --> 37:54.537
How did you get to the drivers?

37:55.562 --> 37:57.040
Come on. Tell me.

37:57.614 --> 37:59.535
What do you have to lose at this point?

38:03.052 --> 38:05.490
When someone makes $40,000 a year

38:05.581 --> 38:08.096
and you offer them a million to give you a shot of adrenaline,

38:08.618 --> 38:11.491
you can be reasonably assured you're going to get your shot.

38:12.222 --> 38:14.577
Well, then who did the Medical Examiner examine?

38:14.649 --> 38:17.373
Who did the Coroner perform an autopsy on?

38:24.678 --> 38:26.630
I don't know. I couldn't tell you.

38:26.869 --> 38:29.012
It's not like he had a whole lot to say when we met.

38:36.664 --> 38:38.764
His Honor is going to like this headline.

38:39.107 --> 38:40.066
Well, good.

38:40.700 --> 38:41.923
We aim to please.

38:42.896 --> 38:44.034
Terrific.

38:44.519 --> 38:47.510
This is so much better for tourism than a ghost on a killing spree.

38:47.994 --> 38:49.097
I'm sure it is.

38:52.645 --> 38:54.524
So, you want to tell me about it?

38:55.405 --> 38:56.427
About what?

38:56.597 --> 38:58.564
This crime that happened over a decade ago.

38:59.628 --> 39:01.324
What? Big date?

39:01.976 --> 39:03.837
Fifth grade science fair.

39:04.619 --> 39:05.465
You know what?

39:05.937 --> 39:09.090
It's held for over a decade. It'll hold one more night.

39:13.125 --> 39:17.272
Make no mistake, parents-- these are our future Thomas Edisons...

39:17.401 --> 39:19.648
- these are our future Madame Curies...
- Ariel?

39:19.741 --> 39:21.829
Be still, honey. What are you looking for?

39:22.777 --> 39:23.560
Sean.

39:24.281 --> 39:26.156
I don't see him, and...

39:26.600 --> 39:28.491
I don't see his mother.

39:30.763 --> 39:32.449
Well, I'm sure they'll be here.

39:32.535 --> 39:34.039
...is awarded to...

39:34.768 --> 39:40.374
Ariel Dubois and Sean Bertoni for their extraordinary rocketry diorama.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.544
Thank you. And, um...

39:57.542 --> 39:59.477
thank you from my partner, Sean.

40:19.195 --> 40:22.619
We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed.

40:22.701 --> 40:24.887
Please check the number and dial again.

40:34.422 --> 40:36.408
Did you speak to his mother?

40:36.541 --> 40:39.167
Is he okay? Does he know I have his ribbon?

40:39.299 --> 40:41.384
Uh, no, I didn't speak to his mother.

40:41.497 --> 40:43.095
I didn't speak to anybody.

40:46.090 --> 40:48.419
Uh, their phone's been disconnected.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.178
What do you mean? Broken?

40:52.828 --> 40:53.719
No.

40:54.134 --> 40:55.195
Shut off.

40:56.254 --> 40:58.230
That's what you do when you move.

40:59.698 --> 41:01.236
What do you mean?

41:01.696 --> 41:03.600
Sean wouldn't have moved.

41:03.913 --> 41:05.516
He just got here.

41:05.736 --> 41:08.004
Honey, I think maybe he did.

41:08.715 --> 41:11.967
At least... maybe his mommy did, and...

41:13.135 --> 41:14.138
Ariel...

41:15.485 --> 41:17.046
I think he's gone.

41:17.937 --> 41:18.847
Baby...

41:20.082 --> 41:21.235
Mommy...

41:21.511 --> 41:23.292
Mommy, why?

41:23.492 --> 41:24.372
Why?

41:28.116 --> 41:29.867
Define "irony."

41:31.105 --> 41:32.806
Oh, you know.

41:33.384 --> 41:36.795
Not steely. Not brassy. Just kinda...

41:38.981 --> 41:41.112
Irony. Got it.

41:41.869 --> 41:43.533
Why don't you define "irony"?

41:45.106 --> 41:48.893
Thinking a little nine-year-old boy is going to break my daughter's heart...

41:49.980 --> 41:55.088
and then discovering that despite all my special gifts,

41:55.631 --> 42:00.188
all my privileged knowledge, I am still not smart enough to see--

42:00.239 --> 42:01.729
not smart enough to know--

42:02.599 --> 42:06.030
that... it's actually destined to be me...

42:06.844 --> 42:09.327
me that's going to break my daughter's heart.

42:12.374 --> 42:14.469
She's so sad, Joe.

42:15.327 --> 42:17.078
She's so upset.

42:18.565 --> 42:20.161
And it's my fault.

42:20.873 --> 42:21.769
Today.

42:22.236 --> 42:24.200
It's your fault it happened today.

42:24.488 --> 42:26.382
But it's not your fault it happened.

42:27.088 --> 42:28.800
You're not that important.

42:29.347 --> 42:30.667
And you know what else?

42:31.379 --> 42:32.874
Her heart will heal.

42:33.458 --> 42:34.492
It will.

42:36.714 --> 42:38.568
I don't want this anymore.

42:39.203 --> 42:42.107
I want to give all this special-ness back.

42:42.966 --> 42:44.339
Hmm, doesn't work that way.

42:44.856 --> 42:46.945
It's all part of the Allison package.

42:48.890 --> 42:50.380
And we're all just stuck with it.

42:52.229 --> 42:53.350
Thank God.
