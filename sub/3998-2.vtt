00:02.373 --> 00:04.873
So I've been thinking
a lot about it, and...

00:04.908 --> 00:08.144
I'd really like to start calling you
"Shorty" in public.

00:08.178 --> 00:11.116
By the way, my office is throwing
a party tomorrow, and I would...

00:11.151 --> 00:13.050
- I'd really like for you to be there.
- Well, I have a photo shoot,

00:13.085 --> 00:14.455
but I think I could
come after that.

00:14.489 --> 00:16.123
Oh, yeah,
well, that sounds good.

00:16.157 --> 00:17.291
Who's that?

00:17.326 --> 00:18.995
Hmm?

00:19.029 --> 00:20.398
It's my doctor.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.168
Uh, D-Dr. Cover.

00:22.202 --> 00:25.875
Doc-Doctor Wyland Cover.
He's my oncologist.

00:25.910 --> 00:28.044
- He's an oncologist.
- Hey,

00:28.079 --> 00:29.547
you guys know
anything about cats?

00:29.581 --> 00:31.049
Yeah, I'm trying
to score some points with Daisy,

00:31.085 --> 00:32.753
so I promised to watch
her cat tonight.

00:32.787 --> 00:34.420
They carry disease,
they're obsessed with my nipples,

00:34.455 --> 00:36.522
and they are unwelcome
in this loft.

00:36.556 --> 00:39.390
Did you just say that cats are
obsessed with your nipples?

00:39.424 --> 00:41.224
I've told you this story before.

00:46.268 --> 00:49.738
I think I would have remembered
that story.

00:49.772 --> 00:51.206
No cats.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.441
Come on, bangs,
you sons of bitches.

00:53.475 --> 00:54.942
- Here, let me do 'em, Jess.
- What?

00:54.976 --> 00:57.709
- Nick, Nick, stop.
- What?

00:57.743 --> 00:59.242
- Stop, you're gonna ruin it.
- I'm not gonna ruin...

00:59.277 --> 01:01.008
I was... I was making
'em look prettier.

01:01.043 --> 01:03.177
- No, you weren't.
- Then they look perfect as is.

01:03.212 --> 01:04.444
Can I ask you a question?

01:04.480 --> 01:05.913
Absolutely... we having
this thing right now?

01:05.948 --> 01:07.847
- Do I look okay?
- Do you look okay?

01:07.881 --> 01:09.247
- Yeah.
- Hell yeah!

01:09.282 --> 01:10.880
I want to put it on you.

01:10.915 --> 01:12.414
On? Put it on me?

01:12.448 --> 01:14.549
Yeah, on... I stand by that.

01:14.583 --> 01:16.417
I'd like to put it on you.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.719
What is wrong, Jess?

01:18.753 --> 01:20.954
I've been at this new school
for a week now

01:20.988 --> 01:22.722
and I still haven't made
any friends.

01:22.756 --> 01:24.725
There's, like,
a clique of teachers,

01:24.759 --> 01:27.028
and they run the school.

01:27.162 --> 01:30.131

01:41.511 --> 01:42.979
I know it sounds dumb, but...

01:43.013 --> 01:44.482
Leave it to me.
I'll fix it.

01:44.516 --> 01:46.951
You're Nick Miller's girl now.
You're my old lady.

01:46.985 --> 01:48.885
- What?
- Whatever you need, you got it.

01:48.919 --> 01:50.265
Why are you talking like
a James Taylor song?

01:50.333 --> 01:51.457
I don't know.

01:51.492 --> 01:53.990
Hey, either of you guys
know anything about cats?

01:54.024 --> 01:56.625
Oh, my God, Schmidt has
the greatest cat story!

01:56.960 --> 01:59.161
- Ugh, I was there... it's disgusting.
- You shut your damn mouth, Jess.

01:59.196 --> 02:00.163
Thought it was cute...

02:00.197 --> 02:01.630
Oh, grow up!

02:01.665 --> 02:03.843
Nothing came out.

02:14.124 --> 02:16.490
You know what? I've never
actually seen you this happy.

02:16.524 --> 02:19.238
- Who are you?
- I don't know, it's weird.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.133
I've never seen you smile.
Ever.

02:21.168 --> 02:23.284
This is the first time.
It's not bad.

02:23.319 --> 02:25.236
- I mean, it's not great.
- Yeah, I agree.

02:25.271 --> 02:26.516
Somewhere right in the middle.

02:26.551 --> 02:28.356
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Of course.

02:28.391 --> 02:30.204
Hypothetically speaking,
what if you met somebody

02:30.238 --> 02:34.174
that you... that you liked,
uh, just as much as Jess?

02:34.209 --> 02:35.609
Schmidt, stop.

02:35.644 --> 02:37.111
Okay, you picked Cece,
so let Elizabeth go.

02:37.145 --> 02:38.779
Initially I said
"hypothetically," so just...

02:38.813 --> 02:40.681
Do you know a place I can get
cheap school supplies?

02:40.715 --> 02:42.283
I only have $15

02:42.317 --> 02:43.884
and a halfie...
$15 and a halfie.

02:43.918 --> 02:45.963
- A halfie?
- Yeah, it's a half.

02:45.998 --> 02:47.020
It got ripped, so it's a half.

02:47.055 --> 02:48.289
No one's gonna accept
that as currency.

02:48.323 --> 02:50.257
Hey, what's up, guys?

02:50.292 --> 02:52.026
- Did you press the button?
- I thought you pressed the button!

02:52.060 --> 02:53.861
What is wrong with you?!

02:53.895 --> 02:56.730
- What did you do when you walked in?
- Talked to you.

02:56.765 --> 02:58.299
Guys, I'm gonna go pick up
Daisy's cat.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.434
You know, you don't just ask anybody
to take care of your cat.

03:00.468 --> 03:01.568
That's a very serious thing,

03:01.603 --> 03:04.104
so I decided
I'm gonna go over there

03:04.139 --> 03:06.774
and I'm gonna ask Daisy
to be my girlfriend.

03:06.808 --> 03:08.108
- You are?
- Whoa!

03:08.143 --> 03:09.410
- Yeah.
- Major move!

03:09.444 --> 03:11.812
- Good stuff.
- Look at you, man.

03:11.846 --> 03:14.081
So I'm just gonna go over there
and I'm gonna tell Daisy,

03:14.115 --> 03:18.752
"Listen, my heart is a two-man bike,
and I want you in the rear."

03:18.787 --> 03:20.888
What do you think?

03:20.922 --> 03:23.666
Winston, don't say that.
You want her in your...?

03:23.701 --> 03:25.059
You can say "the rear."
You don't want her in your rear.

03:25.093 --> 03:26.727
No, don't say
"the rear" at any time.

03:26.761 --> 03:27.828
- You guys are just jealous.
- What?

03:27.862 --> 03:29.463
You guys are gonna steal
my swag.

03:29.497 --> 03:31.799
I wouldn't even know how
to begin to steal a swag.

03:32.762 --> 03:34.967
- I thought you pressed the button.
- I've been way over here.

03:35.002 --> 03:37.771
- I-I haven't pressed...
- I'll press the button.

03:37.806 --> 03:41.475
Last night,
I rectified our budget

03:41.509 --> 03:46.180
while taking a long soak
in my new Jacooz.

03:46.214 --> 03:49.750
My elbows are as soft as babies.

03:49.784 --> 03:51.810
I love a soft elbow.

03:51.845 --> 03:53.187
How about you bring
that noise over here.

03:53.221 --> 03:55.255
Good meeting.

03:55.290 --> 03:56.924
Great, well...

03:56.958 --> 03:58.792
Uh...

04:01.162 --> 04:03.197
- Foster's such a dork.
- He needs to get laid.

04:03.231 --> 04:04.798
I got laid.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.468
This morning.

04:07.502 --> 04:09.103
From my boyfriend.

04:09.137 --> 04:10.437
So...

04:10.472 --> 04:13.474
coitus no-one-interruptus.

04:13.508 --> 04:17.177
That... because we finished, so...

04:17.212 --> 04:19.012
Why are you talking to us?

04:19.047 --> 04:21.380
- You have owl eyes.
- Yeah.

04:23.852 --> 04:24.818
Hey!

04:24.853 --> 04:25.819
Trust me.

04:25.854 --> 04:27.287
What's up, teachers?

04:27.322 --> 04:30.057
Who wants free school supplies?

04:30.091 --> 04:32.635
- What are you doing here?
- Point to the ones who don't like you...

04:32.727 --> 04:34.528
- I can handle this myself.
- I'm fixing it for you.

04:34.562 --> 04:36.330
And then she... Yeah.

04:36.364 --> 04:39.333
Say, listen, why don't you guys
come to my bar later for free drinks.

04:39.367 --> 04:40.601
Teachers don't pay.

04:41.669 --> 04:43.036
We'll think about it.

04:43.071 --> 04:44.471
Okay, they'll think about it.

04:44.506 --> 04:46.006
Bye.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.975
Oh, my God.

04:48.009 --> 04:49.999
- That was genius.
- It's a no-brainer.

04:50.034 --> 04:51.845
Whoa, that's an amazing move,
sex partner.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.480
Sex part...

04:53.515 --> 04:56.083
With the promotion, uh,
I got a new office,

04:56.117 --> 04:58.886
so I don't have to look at Bethany's
mismanaged eyebrows all day.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.522
Do you like it?
It's a perfect two-thirds replica

05:01.556 --> 05:03.090
of Don Draper's
office from Mad Men,

05:03.124 --> 05:04.758
and you're my sexy Peggy.

05:04.793 --> 05:06.393
Good God,
at least shut the door.

05:06.428 --> 05:07.428
My tiny credenza is in the way.

05:07.462 --> 05:08.929
Hey, Elizabeth,

05:08.963 --> 05:10.431
are you gonna be coming
to the party tomorrow night?

05:10.465 --> 05:12.499
Party? What party?

05:12.534 --> 05:13.834
The big office party.

05:13.868 --> 05:16.270
Schmidt,
did you not invite her?

05:16.304 --> 05:19.440
I was just about to
invite you to go.

05:19.474 --> 05:21.341
Cool, it's a date.

05:21.376 --> 05:22.709
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

05:22.744 --> 05:24.244
Mwah, mwah.

05:25.814 --> 05:27.247
How... how dare you interfere

05:27.282 --> 05:28.882
with my personal life,
you crone.

05:28.917 --> 05:30.584
I don't...
I don't kick up a fuss

05:30.618 --> 05:33.120
when you massage yourself
with your yoga ball.

05:33.154 --> 05:35.289
Oh, I'm sorry,
were you gonna invite Cece?

05:35.323 --> 05:38.792
Beth, please. I am in love
with both of these women.

05:38.827 --> 05:41.128
Do I feel bad
about lying to them?

05:41.162 --> 05:43.297
Yes. I'm a Sagittarius.

05:43.331 --> 05:45.199
Congrats on your new office.

05:45.233 --> 05:47.267
Gina gave birth on that carpet.

05:53.408 --> 05:55.375
Consider this closed.

05:55.410 --> 05:58.078
Right, so, yeah, um...

05:58.112 --> 06:02.049
Um, so, Daisy, what I was
really trying to say...

06:02.083 --> 06:04.051
is, uh...

06:04.085 --> 06:05.452
Is your shower running?

06:05.487 --> 06:06.787
Yeah, I was just about
to take a shower.

06:06.821 --> 06:08.055
- What's going on?
- Okay.

06:08.089 --> 06:11.992
Um, Daisy, I think
what we have is real,

06:12.026 --> 06:14.328
and, uh, I want us
to be exclusive...

06:14.362 --> 06:18.832
just you and me in the rear.

06:18.867 --> 06:21.568
Yeah, that sounds great.

06:21.603 --> 06:24.037
Awesome, um...

06:25.807 --> 06:28.473
Sorry, that's mine.

06:28.508 --> 06:29.443
So, Furguson gets

06:29.477 --> 06:31.478
his wet food in the morning,
dry food at night.

06:35.817 --> 06:37.818
Somebody in there?

06:37.852 --> 06:38.852
No.

06:40.655 --> 06:41.855
No treats after midnight.

06:43.725 --> 06:47.995
"Oh, my name is Principal Foster,
and this is

06:48.029 --> 06:49.129
the Jacooz."

06:49.163 --> 06:50.430
"The Jacooz."

06:50.465 --> 06:52.266
He's so nice, don't you think?

06:52.300 --> 06:54.924
He's such a nice boss.

06:56.671 --> 06:59.339
Y'all want some drinks?

06:59.374 --> 07:00.641
- Yeah, okay.
- Yep.

07:00.675 --> 07:02.543
- Yeah. Thank, thank you.
- Thank you.

07:02.577 --> 07:04.611
What do you think?
I think it's going really well.

07:04.646 --> 07:05.879
Okay, I just realized
what's happening.

07:05.914 --> 07:07.548
It's high school over there,

07:07.582 --> 07:09.883
and they're the cool kids,
and you're the nerd.

07:09.918 --> 07:11.451
I was never a nerd.

- They made shirts.

07:30.204 --> 07:32.205
You know what? I'm not
explaining my coolness to you.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.841
I was cool. Listen to me.
You want to be in with them?

07:34.876 --> 07:37.344
Roll with the punches,
go with the flow.

07:37.378 --> 07:39.313
Make fun of your boss a little bit.

07:39.347 --> 07:40.681
Don't follow your instincts.

07:40.715 --> 07:42.349
I wouldn't sing.

07:42.383 --> 07:45.185
But most importantly,
follow my lead.

07:45.219 --> 07:48.155
And by "follow my lead,"
I mean drink.

07:48.189 --> 07:49.723
And I mean drink...

07:49.757 --> 07:51.758
a lot.

07:51.793 --> 07:54.595
Drinking to be cool, Nick?
That's not a real thing.

07:54.629 --> 07:57.431
That's the only thing in
the world I know to be true.

08:27.911 --> 08:30.246
Hey, Nick, I got to talk to you.
I have a real problem.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.672
- Oh, my God. Did you kill Jess?
- No, no, no, no.

08:32.707 --> 08:34.850
She just got really drunk last night,
and she passed out.

08:34.885 --> 08:36.552
Hey, guys.

08:36.586 --> 08:38.419
- Are you crying, buddy?
- No.

08:38.455 --> 08:39.722

08:39.756 --> 08:42.258
No, I didn't kill Je...

08:42.292 --> 08:43.859
Okay, remember
when I was so hungover,

08:43.894 --> 08:45.427
I almost missed
my flight for Christmas?

08:45.462 --> 08:46.595
Ah, count it down.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.797
- Three, two, one.
- Two, one.

08:48.832 --> 08:52.101
♪ I believe I can fly ♪

08:52.135 --> 08:54.703
♪ I believe
I can touch the sky ♪

08:54.738 --> 08:58.207
♪ I think about it
every night and day ♪

08:58.241 --> 09:01.810
♪ Spread my wings
and fly away ♪

09:01.845 --> 09:03.479
♪ I believe I can soar ♪

09:03.513 --> 09:05.114
♪ Soar... ♪

09:05.148 --> 09:06.649
- I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.
- Oh, she's awake.

09:06.683 --> 09:08.479
That was beautiful.
Where are my tights?

09:08.514 --> 09:10.074
Uh, in the bathroom
where you barfed.

09:10.109 --> 09:11.754
You sounded
really good there, man.

09:11.788 --> 09:13.589
- Start the band.
- What did you do to her?

09:13.623 --> 09:15.524
I just told her that I thought
drinking would make her cool.

09:15.558 --> 09:17.359
What are you,
a 14-year-old hockey player?

09:17.394 --> 09:19.328
You're supposed to protect her,
not encourage her.

09:19.362 --> 09:21.864
Okay, I am protecting her.
She's my old lady now.

09:21.898 --> 09:24.266
- By turning her into you?
- I'm not...

09:24.301 --> 09:27.202
Yeah, Daisy cheating on me.

09:28.805 --> 09:30.873
Wait, we're using real honey?

09:30.907 --> 09:32.107
So sticky.

09:32.142 --> 09:34.376
Hey, babe!
What a nice surprise!

09:34.411 --> 09:36.078
I came to tell you

09:36.112 --> 09:38.380
that you can't come with me
to the party tonight.

09:38.415 --> 09:42.347
They just told me that it's
employees only. No sig oths.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.752
Just say "significant others."

09:43.787 --> 09:45.754
Maybe you have that kind of time,
but I'm on a tight sched.

09:45.789 --> 09:48.290
Looks like we're gonna go late
here anyway, so no worries.

09:48.325 --> 09:50.125
All right... Shorty.

09:51.428 --> 09:53.329
All right, bring in the bees!

09:53.363 --> 09:54.863
Oh, wait.
The bees are real, too?

09:54.898 --> 09:56.365
Oh, hell no!

09:56.399 --> 09:58.300
Nick, I need your help, okay?

09:58.335 --> 09:59.735
Now, I am no plumber,

09:59.769 --> 10:02.805
but I'm 99% sure that there
was a guy in her bathroom.

10:02.839 --> 10:04.773
So, she agreed
to be exclusive with you...

10:04.808 --> 10:07.743
while the guy she is
obviously sleeping with

10:07.777 --> 10:11.280
was washing his size 15
ding-dong in the shower.

10:11.314 --> 10:13.582
And now you're taking care
of her cat.

10:13.616 --> 10:15.150
Those are the bullet points,
yes.

10:15.185 --> 10:18.187
You know what you got to do
to get yourself out of this situation.

10:18.222 --> 10:20.597
Break up with Daisy!

10:20.632 --> 10:23.275
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you're
making some very good points.

10:23.310 --> 10:25.603
You know, break up with Daisy.
That's an option.

10:25.607 --> 10:27.753
I was thinking, like,
I'll kill her cat.

10:27.831 --> 10:28.831
Winston.

10:30.433 --> 10:32.134
Yeah, I'm-I'm gonna
kill her cat first.

10:32.168 --> 10:33.535
- Hey.
- I'm gonna kill you.

10:37.507 --> 10:39.341
Hey, it's little Toilet Pants.

10:39.376 --> 10:40.509
Hey, Toilet Pants!

10:40.543 --> 10:43.087
♪ Toilet Pants! ♪

10:43.122 --> 10:44.780
Please stop shouting.

10:44.814 --> 10:45.814
You are so awesome.

10:45.849 --> 10:48.150
I want to show you something.

10:48.184 --> 10:49.952
Oh!

10:49.986 --> 10:51.220
Oh. Oh. Oh.

10:52.555 --> 10:54.423
You're one of us now.

10:54.457 --> 10:57.259
You never have to drink
out of a paper cup again.

10:57.293 --> 10:58.894
Fun mugs.

11:00.230 --> 11:03.298
This one makes me look
like I have a...

11:03.333 --> 11:04.967
- mustache.
- Mustache.

11:05.001 --> 11:06.001
Mustache.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.207
- What's up, Winston?
- Oh, hey, Nick.

11:12.242 --> 11:15.210
You know, I couldn't figure out
the best way to kill Furguson,

11:15.245 --> 11:17.179
so I decided
to just let him choose

11:17.213 --> 11:19.114
how he wants to die.

11:19.149 --> 11:21.650
If only I could get him
to leave that damn sunbeam.

11:23.053 --> 11:25.580
- You're gonna murder a cat?
- Yeah.

11:25.615 --> 11:27.279
- This is a joke, right?
- No.

11:27.314 --> 11:30.059
- This is one of your pranks?
- An eye for an eye, Nick.

11:30.093 --> 11:31.460
A cat for a cat.

11:31.494 --> 11:33.128
But what's the other cat?

11:33.163 --> 11:35.531
My heart.

11:35.565 --> 11:37.566
Where's that big flashlight
you can hit people with?

11:37.600 --> 11:40.235
Also, do we have any meat pieces
that might distract a dog?

11:40.270 --> 11:42.404
Winston,
don't do anything stupid.

11:42.439 --> 11:44.673
- Jess, what are you doing?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Cool, cool. It's nothing.

11:44.707 --> 11:46.719
We're just breaking
into Foster's backyard,

11:46.754 --> 11:49.078
and we are gonna put
our butts in his Jacuzzi.

11:49.112 --> 11:50.494
You're gonna put your butts
in his Jacuzzi?

11:50.530 --> 11:52.618
- Isn't it awesome?
- Uh, no, it's not awesome. It's a crime.

11:52.716 --> 11:54.650
It's a very stupid crime,
but it's a crime.

11:54.684 --> 11:56.652
Hey, do you have any makeup
or costumes that might

11:56.686 --> 11:57.986
make someone look like a bush?

11:58.021 --> 11:59.521
You are about to commit a felony.

11:59.556 --> 12:02.558
Oh, my God, Nick!
You said roll with it!

12:02.592 --> 12:04.259
You're not the kind of person
who could break

12:04.294 --> 12:05.928
into the principal's house
and get away with it.

12:05.962 --> 12:07.689
You're the kind of person
who gets caught,

12:07.724 --> 12:09.765
and it ends up on the Internet
in a funny way.

12:09.799 --> 12:13.001
My God!
That is the cutest cat!

12:13.036 --> 12:14.336
Uh, don't get attached.

12:14.370 --> 12:16.171
Okay, both of you,
knock it off!

12:16.206 --> 12:17.606
Winston!

12:17.640 --> 12:19.274
Look, Nick, you're right.

12:19.309 --> 12:21.254
I'm a nerd.
I've never fit in.

12:21.289 --> 12:22.910
If I met you in high school,

12:22.945 --> 12:25.199
you never would have even
noticed me.

12:25.234 --> 12:26.682
That's just because
I didn't go to class.

12:26.716 --> 12:29.518
- I wouldn't have seen you.
- I know it's stupid, but I'm doing it.

12:29.552 --> 12:31.687
- I'm not letting you go.
- Oh, you're not letting me?

12:31.721 --> 12:32.881
No.

12:32.992 --> 12:34.892
If for some reason
I don't come back tonight,

12:34.927 --> 12:38.779
I'll be at the Appleton Suites
under the name Suzuki Sinclair.

12:38.814 --> 12:40.596
- Ask for Charles.
- Don't... Hey, hey.

12:40.630 --> 12:42.397
We're not done with this conversation,
young lady!

12:42.432 --> 12:44.299
- Well, we are done!
- Oh, yeah, then where are you going?!

12:44.334 --> 12:46.068
- I'm getting a flashlight!
- Oh, a hammer, huh?

12:46.102 --> 12:47.703
- Hey, Winston, Winston.
- Good way to go. Thr...

12:47.737 --> 12:49.638
- Don't hurt that cat.
- Uh-huh.

12:49.672 --> 12:52.374
- Hey, Furguson? Furguson?
- You scared him. Don't do this.

12:52.408 --> 12:54.143
- Furguson?
- Winston!

12:54.177 --> 12:56.311
Winston, Winston,
stop what you... Stop!

12:56.346 --> 12:58.046
Don't do that scary walk!

12:58.081 --> 13:00.616
Do not do that scary walk
that you do that scares me!

13:00.650 --> 13:02.251
Hey, Jess? Jess?

13:02.285 --> 13:04.483
Je...?
Winston, don't kill that...!

13:04.518 --> 13:06.655
Jess!
I don't know what to do!

13:12.063 --> 13:13.523
- Oh, good Lord.
- What's wrong?

13:13.558 --> 13:15.891
Nothing. You know what?
Let me show you the stairwell

13:15.925 --> 13:17.659
where they got the idea
for the escalator.

13:19.996 --> 13:22.564
Shorty! My love.
My only love.

13:22.598 --> 13:24.900
I'm sorry. I just... I quit that job,
and I had to see you.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.035
How emotional.
Let's go talk about it in private

13:27.069 --> 13:29.404
in a perfect two-thirds replica
of Don Draper's office.

13:29.438 --> 13:31.439
You stay here.
I'm gonna get you a drink.

13:31.474 --> 13:33.742
No, no, no, please,
you-you... you stay here.

13:35.912 --> 13:36.978
- So...
- Oh, God, what?

13:37.013 --> 13:39.414
They're both here.
The gas has been spilled.

13:39.448 --> 13:40.882
All we need is a match.

13:40.917 --> 13:43.632
What, are you narrating a book?

13:49.959 --> 13:52.427
Here it comes.

13:52.461 --> 13:55.297
The long nap.

13:58.868 --> 14:01.303
Oh, wow. Tell you what,
man, we both need to just

14:01.337 --> 14:02.604
cool off and have a drink.

14:02.638 --> 14:04.406
You smoke?
I'm just kidding.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.308
But, man,
that'd be cute if you did.

14:07.944 --> 14:09.778
What is wrong with me?

14:09.812 --> 14:12.447
It...

14:12.481 --> 14:15.350
Oh, Furguson.

14:15.384 --> 14:18.420
So, listen, I've been dreaming
about this fantasy, and I think

14:18.454 --> 14:20.822
this party might be
the perfect place to try it out.

14:20.856 --> 14:22.791
Okay, but I can't get wet.

14:22.825 --> 14:26.094
No water. So, listen, you and I
are gonna be sexy strangers.

14:26.128 --> 14:29.464
Yeah? Now, your stranger is
the early-to-bed type,

14:29.498 --> 14:31.866
and your job has you
on Hong Kong time.

14:31.901 --> 14:33.601
But the most important thing is,

14:33.636 --> 14:36.171
you're the first person
to leave the party.

14:36.205 --> 14:37.305
Whew. I like.

14:39.842 --> 14:41.376
- Wait, is that Cece?
- Is that who?

14:41.410 --> 14:42.544
Huh? No.

14:42.578 --> 14:45.714
- Cece. No.
- No, Schmidt, that's definitely Cece.

14:49.819 --> 14:52.387
Sorry, in between modeling jobs,
she does catering.

14:52.421 --> 14:54.489
You mind if I go over there
and say hello?

14:54.523 --> 14:55.557
I think it's only right.

14:55.591 --> 14:57.425
Eh.

14:59.662 --> 15:01.162
- Hey.
- Hey, I know you told me to stay

15:01.197 --> 15:03.064
in the office,
but Beth insisted that I...

15:03.099 --> 15:04.799
Stay away from that woman.
She is patient zero

15:04.834 --> 15:06.528
in this office
for spreading HPV.

15:06.563 --> 15:07.669
Here. Put on this apron.

15:07.703 --> 15:09.671
No, why-why would I do that?
That's crazy.

15:09.705 --> 15:12.040
My boss was asking, so I
told her you were a caterer.

15:12.074 --> 15:14.042
So... just... It's a good idea.

15:14.076 --> 15:16.344
- Okay.
- Just... Yes.

15:16.379 --> 15:17.979
You really want me here,
don't you?

15:18.014 --> 15:20.115
So badly.

15:21.751 --> 15:23.518
Can we just come back
when we have a plan?

15:23.552 --> 15:24.853
Are you afraid?

15:24.887 --> 15:26.254
No, I'm not afraid.

15:26.288 --> 15:27.689
Rose, give me a boost.

15:27.723 --> 15:29.224
Here's Rose.
I got you.

15:29.258 --> 15:31.493
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

15:31.527 --> 15:32.894
You got to help me a little.

15:32.928 --> 15:34.229
That's a hell of a grip, Rose.

15:35.264 --> 15:36.731
I see the Jacuzzi!

15:36.766 --> 15:38.433
Didn't stick the landing!

15:38.467 --> 15:39.601
You're doing great.

15:39.635 --> 15:42.570
I'm gonna do a loop
to not attract suspicion.

15:42.605 --> 15:45.106
- All right.
- All right.

15:46.108 --> 15:47.742
Schmidt. I'm right here.

15:47.777 --> 15:50.011
Oh. Do I know you?

15:50.046 --> 15:51.446
Right.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.714
The fantasy.

15:52.748 --> 15:55.116
Boy, I got to go.

15:56.619 --> 15:59.254
I have a 5:00 a.m.
conference call with...

15:59.288 --> 16:01.056
the Asians.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.458
Are you leaving soon, stranger?

16:03.492 --> 16:04.959
You mean "Corporal"?

16:04.994 --> 16:07.295
And, no, I'm gonna stick around
and throw down one more beer.

16:07.329 --> 16:09.964
Sweet.

16:09.999 --> 16:11.599
Oh, hey.

16:11.634 --> 16:12.967
Don't tell me you're leaving.

16:13.002 --> 16:14.369
Whew, great news.

16:14.403 --> 16:16.905
My boss is in her office
completely passed out.

16:16.939 --> 16:19.240
- We finally have the night to ourselves.
- Thank God.

16:19.275 --> 16:21.109
It's getting a little weird here,
right?

16:21.143 --> 16:23.278
Dressed up like this.

16:25.114 --> 16:27.182
That Elizabeth?

16:33.989 --> 16:37.659
Okay, look, Cece,
I-I got to tell you something.

16:37.693 --> 16:40.624
Does Elizabeth... work here?

16:40.963 --> 16:42.497
Yes.

16:42.531 --> 16:44.432
Hey.

16:44.467 --> 16:46.101
We were just talking about you.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.502
The food was good.

16:47.536 --> 16:48.837
Yeah.

16:48.871 --> 16:51.172
I was thinking of
taking some home.

16:51.207 --> 16:52.407
You deserve it.

16:52.441 --> 16:54.109
Okay, well, I'm heading off.

16:54.143 --> 16:57.545
The Asian markets
wait for no one.

17:00.449 --> 17:01.483
Wow.

17:01.517 --> 17:04.152
She was ice cold to you.

17:04.185 --> 17:06.753
I'm gonna go get a drink.

17:06.789 --> 17:08.790
What a night.

17:10.000 --> 17:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:17.439 --> 17:18.983
- I got this!
- Open the damn gate!

17:19.058 --> 17:20.710
- Everything's under control!
- Jess, hey!

17:20.790 --> 17:21.891
Don't move! I'm coming over!
Rose, move!

17:21.925 --> 17:23.626
Jess, hey. I'm coming.

17:23.661 --> 17:25.862
- I got you.
- Whoa, hey, Rose!

17:25.896 --> 17:28.498
Ease up on the throttle.
Those are my precious goods.

17:28.531 --> 17:29.866
Did you follow me here?

17:29.900 --> 17:30.700
Here I come!

17:30.734 --> 17:33.303
- Nick.
- Hey.

17:33.337 --> 17:36.272
Hey, Jess. Jess, hey.
You okay?

17:36.307 --> 17:37.607
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry I tried

17:37.641 --> 17:39.976
to stick my nose in this.
I just...

17:40.010 --> 17:43.279
I just... I came here
because I'm your old man now.

17:43.314 --> 17:47.650
And if you're gonna do something
that's obviously very stupid...

17:47.685 --> 17:49.652
then I'm gonna do it with you.

17:55.326 --> 17:56.292
Oh.
Oh, my God.

17:56.327 --> 17:58.027
- You go there.
- Ow.

17:58.062 --> 18:00.029
- What's going on out here?
- Hey.

18:00.064 --> 18:02.332
- Who are you?
- No, I-I used to live here.

18:02.366 --> 18:04.000
I was just doing a visit
around the neighborhood.

18:04.034 --> 18:06.169
That's my old bedroom
right there.

18:06.203 --> 18:07.704
That's a bathroom.

18:07.738 --> 18:08.838
To you maybe it is.

18:08.873 --> 18:10.673
But to me and my four brothers,

18:10.708 --> 18:12.876
- that's a home.
- Nick.

18:12.910 --> 18:14.444
Nick, I can't let you do this.

18:14.478 --> 18:16.379
Mostly 'cause you're so bad at it.

18:16.413 --> 18:17.780
- Is that you, Ms. Day?
- Yes.

18:17.815 --> 18:19.616
It is. I'm so sorry.

18:19.650 --> 18:21.885
I trespassed on your property.

18:21.919 --> 18:26.956
And I would not be surprised
if you fired me.

18:26.991 --> 18:30.393
I think I know
what's really going on here.

18:30.427 --> 18:34.564
You heard about
my new... Jacooz.

18:36.267 --> 18:38.201
And you wanted a taste.

18:38.235 --> 18:40.069
♪ And say a little prayer
for right ♪

18:40.104 --> 18:43.139
♪ You know that if we are

18:43.174 --> 18:46.576

18:46.610 --> 18:48.144

18:49.180 --> 18:50.480
♪ Doo-doo-doo... ♪

18:50.514 --> 18:52.615
Hey, babe.
Thanks for watching him.

18:52.650 --> 18:54.651
He can be a real pain
in the ass, huh?

18:54.685 --> 18:56.219
Yeah...

18:56.253 --> 18:57.987
Was there a dude
in your shower yesterday?

18:58.022 --> 19:00.256
Yes.

19:00.291 --> 19:01.624
Hmm.
How do you know him?

19:01.659 --> 19:02.959
From sex.

19:02.993 --> 19:05.595
But it was from sex before
you and I were exclusive.

19:05.629 --> 19:08.398
Have you had sex with him since?

19:08.432 --> 19:09.399
No.

19:09.433 --> 19:10.800
Oh, wait. Yes.

19:10.834 --> 19:12.168
Last night.

19:12.203 --> 19:15.605
Look, um...
I really liked you, Daisy.

19:15.639 --> 19:18.308
You know, I wanted this
to be a thing, but, uh...

19:18.743 --> 19:20.643
I deserve better.

19:22.313 --> 19:24.180
And so does Furguson.

19:24.215 --> 19:25.181
Hmm?

19:25.216 --> 19:26.883
I'm keeping the cat.

19:28.886 --> 19:30.486
I got your cat!

19:36.561 --> 19:39.362
Well, Schmidt, you win.

19:39.396 --> 19:41.965
They both really love you.

19:41.999 --> 19:44.834
So... enjoy your office.

19:48.205 --> 19:50.440
- Hey! Toilet Pants!
- Oh!

19:50.474 --> 19:52.675
Toilet Pants!

19:52.710 --> 19:54.677
Thanks for taking the bullet
for us the other night.

19:54.712 --> 19:57.780
How long were you stuck
in that Jacuzzi for?

19:57.815 --> 19:59.949
I don't really want
to talk about it, but, um,

19:59.984 --> 20:03.553
at one point, he did grab
my foot with his toes

20:03.587 --> 20:05.822
like it was a hand.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.323
What are you doing tonight?

20:07.358 --> 20:09.058
'Cause we got a liquid
form of Ecstasy,

20:09.093 --> 20:10.727
and we're gonna grade
papers together. What?

20:10.761 --> 20:12.295
I would love to,

20:12.329 --> 20:15.298
but I actually think
I'm gonna hang out...

20:15.332 --> 20:17.300
with my old man.

20:17.334 --> 20:19.168
That's... weird.

20:19.203 --> 20:20.370
Cool.

20:20.404 --> 20:22.672
- See you.
- Weirdo.

20:32.149 --> 20:34.083
Hi.

20:34.118 --> 20:35.885
So I hear you're interested
in joining the Sack Pack.

20:35.919 --> 20:37.687
I might be.

20:37.721 --> 20:39.355
Then perhaps this will
wet your whistle

20:39.390 --> 20:41.391
of what's fun
about being a member.

20:43.527 --> 20:45.328
- Just leave it.
- Yeah.

20:45.362 --> 20:47.897
You are terrible at Hacky Sack.

20:47.931 --> 20:49.332
I think I'm retiring.

20:55.139 --> 20:57.273
Yeah, I just want to say...

20:57.308 --> 20:59.208
I would've noticed you.

21:10.120 --> 21:11.521
Want to go do it
in the teachers' lounge?

21:11.555 --> 21:12.855
- Yes.
- You do?

21:12.890 --> 21:14.524
Oh, I'm gonna do it
with a teacher!

21:16.593 --> 21:19.662
Shh.

21:23.767 --> 21:26.536
Okay, something is
definitely coming out.

21:29.139 --> 21:30.506
I think we should go.
