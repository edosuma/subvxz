00:17.518 --> 00:19.520
El Gato!

00:36.798 --> 00:39.913
<b>4x03 - Fluteus Maximus</b>

00:55.097 --> 00:58.850
I don't like it.
I don't like it! I don't like it!

00:59.184 --> 01:01.812
This horrible, unsettling witch place.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.605
It reminds me of something,
but I can't remember what!

01:04.690 --> 01:06.400
I can't remember!

01:32.592 --> 01:33.719
The third witch.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.147
Puss, wait.

01:45.480 --> 01:50.736
Dulcinea, we need the last piece
of the gem. For San Lorenzo.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.762
Burning candles and an open window.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.264
Clearly, these clues
can mean only one thing.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.892
The third witch is invisible.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.477
Oh. Umm...

02:23.560 --> 02:26.980
Or she heard us coming
and escaped through that window.

02:29.274 --> 02:33.570
Yes. Yes, yes.
This is possible too, I suppose.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.448
But you agree that
she is probably invisible, yes?

02:36.531 --> 02:39.993
Actually, I think she probably
went out through the window.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.204
Oh. But surely you believe...

02:42.287 --> 02:43.372
Window.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.168
Ah.

02:48.251 --> 02:52.506
Very well. We will entertain
your wild notion this time.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.883
You might turn out to be right, Puss.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.928
Who knows?
Things aren't always what they seem.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.306
Especially when witchcraft
and magic are involved.

03:01.390 --> 03:05.644
Hey, maybe that's why
you feel so uneasy, Duchy. Duchy?

03:08.939 --> 03:12.025
So, should we leave and go follow
that third witch now? Should we leave?

03:12.109 --> 03:13.276
Let's leave and go do that.

03:13.944 --> 03:16.780
Oh, don't worry, Duchess.
We're almost done here.

03:16.863 --> 03:20.367
This is true. We have only one witch left.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.536
But which witch?

03:25.038 --> 03:25.872
Which witch?

03:25.997 --> 03:27.874
I have amused myself once again.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.585
Which witch, which witch, which witch,
which witch, which witch-witch.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.926
Huh?

03:52.941 --> 03:53.859
Woof!

03:56.611 --> 04:00.699
Puss!

04:01.742 --> 04:04.786
I know I'm beginning to sound
like a broken town crier here,

04:04.870 --> 04:08.665
but I can't tell you how incredibly
unsettling I find this place.

04:10.417 --> 04:13.253
Can you hear it? What beautiful music!

04:30.729 --> 04:32.397
What is this? I cannot stop.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.941
This is the most humiliating thing
I can think of.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.443
Puss, are you all right?

04:37.194 --> 04:39.279
Look away! Look away!

04:39.362 --> 04:42.240
Oh, the music! Can you hear it?

04:42.324 --> 04:46.161
I told you, this place is evil!
It will destroy us all!

04:46.244 --> 04:48.955
Oh, I don't like it. I don't like it.
I don't like it.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.291
This is the worst! This is...

04:51.374 --> 04:52.375
...the worst!

04:52.959 --> 04:55.587
This music, it's entrancing!

04:57.964 --> 05:00.425
Oh, now, I'm dancing over here.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.429
Oh, and now, I'm dancing over here.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.014
Hey, I'm the crazy one.

05:06.097 --> 05:10.268
You're stealing my act!
I can do crazy better than anyone!

05:18.568 --> 05:22.489
Oh, yeah, that's real good.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.826
I'm gonna have my revenge on you,
kitty brother man.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.957
Why am I doing this?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.042
Even if I had an itch there,
which I do not,

05:34.125 --> 05:35.836
this would not help in the least.

05:36.962 --> 05:40.131
Hey, make him squawk
and say he wants a cracker.

05:40.215 --> 05:44.761
Who is that woman?
And why does she look so familiar?

05:45.470 --> 05:49.808
Well, well. It's, like,
the San Lorenzo crew.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.811
It's the Piper. She's got a flute
that controls bees,

05:52.894 --> 05:55.105
except now it apparently controls Puss.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.316
Figured you'd just trespass
through my realm, huh?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.944
We didn't mean to disturb you, Miss Piper.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.446
You see, we're looking
for the third Eldritch sister.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.407
You found her, kitty babe.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.869
Some call me the Piper,
but the real handle's Maliflua.

06:09.953 --> 06:13.957
Youngest Eldritch sister
and controller of all beasts.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.292
Including cats.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.753
Here, boy. Be a good watchdog and attack!

06:37.063 --> 06:38.148
Puss!

06:41.026 --> 06:44.154
Puss, it's the music. Try to block it out!

06:44.237 --> 06:45.947
I cannot.

06:46.031 --> 06:49.409
It is like she is playing her vile tune
directly into my soul!

06:51.578 --> 06:54.080
Then let's get that flute
away from her once and for all!

07:03.882 --> 07:06.760
- I have been freed. What a relief!
- Watch out!

07:06.843 --> 07:09.679
My relief is short-lived.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.015
She's controlling me now.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.850
For someone whom I like quite a lot,

07:13.934 --> 07:16.311
I find myself battling you
much more than I would care to.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.229
It's really becoming a thing
with us, isn't it?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.483
But I can't help it. She's controlling me.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.193
Let us start by...

07:23.276 --> 07:24.486
Yah-ha!

07:25.070 --> 07:26.821
There. Now we shall see what...

07:26.905 --> 07:28.990
Whoa-oh. My turn.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.912
Are we just going to sit here and watch
while they battle each other?

07:33.995 --> 07:37.165
You're right! We ought to
get a turn on that flute.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.418
Hmm. Never been great
at musical instruments.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.254
- Huh?
- Give me my flute back, old dude!

07:43.338 --> 07:44.464
Do you have to wind it up or what?

07:44.547 --> 07:46.800
Artephius, you have saved us!

07:47.676 --> 07:50.553
En garde, evil practitioner
of flute-based mayhem!

07:50.637 --> 07:51.888
Whoa!

07:55.392 --> 07:56.226
Must you?

07:56.434 --> 07:58.019
Oh, sorry. Carry on.

07:58.103 --> 08:01.856
You think I'm only packing one flute,
kitty brother man? Think again.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.234
You have two flutes that control cats?

08:04.317 --> 08:09.155
Like, no way. Each flute controls
a different creature. Observe.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.140
They are like eensy-teensy little kisses.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.769
I knew I should've brought the flute
that controls dragons.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.231
Be free, my adorable little
butterfly friends.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.444
- And now, Melissa...
- Maliflua.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.572
You will hand over your piece
of the Gem of the Crown of Souls!

08:50.655 --> 08:54.075
What, that bourgie jewel thing?
Grandpa dude's got it.

08:54.159 --> 08:57.037
Who, me? Really? I do? Where?

08:57.120 --> 09:00.123
Not here. No, not here.
Say, maybe it's under me.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.375
I'll dig a hole
with this flute thing to check.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.919
Also, what are we looking for, again?

09:08.298 --> 09:10.258
The third piece of the...

09:10.341 --> 09:12.385
Puss, look what I found!

09:12.469 --> 09:15.180
It's the third piece
of the Gem of the Crown.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.891
It must've made her flute extra powerful.

09:18.099 --> 09:18.933
Ah.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.061
So that explains how
one as strong as myself

09:21.144 --> 09:22.729
could have fallen under its influence.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.942
That dog stuff, eh? Quite a good gag,
but probably not worth thinking about

09:28.026 --> 09:30.070
or talking about
or even remembering, right?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.948
I have already forgotten
literally everything you've ever done.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.533
- Melissa...
- Maliflua.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.495
You are about to witness
something truly special.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.082
One, two...

09:42.582 --> 09:43.708
I thought we were going on two.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.834
Nobody goes on two.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.378
People with adventure pulsing
through their veins go on two!

09:47.462 --> 09:48.296
And three.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.219
Wait. This isn't the whole gem.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.597
Yes, there is still a piece missing.

09:58.765 --> 10:02.644
It's getting kinda spooky around here,
right, Duchy?

10:02.727 --> 10:07.565
Uh... Uh... Mama no like.
No, no, no. Not for me! Not for me!

10:12.195 --> 10:13.822
This does not make any sense.

10:14.364 --> 10:17.575
We have retrieved the three pieces of
the gem from the three Eldritch sisters,

10:17.659 --> 10:19.661
visiting each of them
in their respective turrets,

10:19.744 --> 10:21.579
of which there are a grand total of...

10:25.667 --> 10:27.877
Four! A fourth turret!

10:27.961 --> 10:28.795
Whoa!

10:28.878 --> 10:33.258
There must've been a spell cloaking it.
It was invisible!

10:33.341 --> 10:36.594
Ha! You see? I knew
something would be invisible.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.972
You have tried to hide
this fourth turret from us,

10:39.055 --> 10:41.599
and, with it, the final piece of the gem.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.144
Does your treachery know no bounds?

10:44.227 --> 10:45.061
Whoa.

10:45.353 --> 10:48.231
That turret was never there before, man!

10:48.314 --> 10:53.236
I swear. This whole thing's
freaking me out big time. I'm gonna bolt!

10:55.864 --> 10:59.159
Melissa, you will now lead us
to the fourth turret.

10:59.242 --> 11:02.745
No, no! I can't go back in there.
No, no, no, no no.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.291
I'll just hang out here
with my new friend, Mr. Tree.

11:06.374 --> 11:11.421
There's nothing to be jealous about,
they're just friends. Nope, can't do it.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.965
Get away from my lady-friend, Mr. Tree!

11:14.048 --> 11:16.342
Duchess, you've been
fretting and stressing

11:16.426 --> 11:19.637
ever since we got to this castle,
and nothing's gone wrong.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.891
Yes. Besides having a witch
attempt to enslave us as her familiars,

11:22.974 --> 11:25.184
having another witch
entomb me in a nightmare,

11:25.268 --> 11:28.146
and having this third witch control
our actions with an enchanted flute,

11:28.229 --> 11:31.816
this trip has been
easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.360
There's nothing to be afraid of, Duchess.

11:34.444 --> 11:38.406
Sure, the castle looks spooky,
but things aren't always what they seem.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.659
Fine.
I'll come inside with you.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.620
But if something terrible happens,

11:43.703 --> 11:47.999
I'm going to, A, gloat about it,
and B, need you to save me.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.250
Let us go.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.049
Whoa!

12:00.345 --> 12:05.850
See? What did I tell you,
kitty brother man? No fourth turret, dig?

12:05.934 --> 12:09.604
Oh, yes, she's right, nothing there.
Such a shame. Off we go, then.

12:11.981 --> 12:12.899
Huh?

12:18.446 --> 12:19.864
What is this?

12:47.266 --> 12:48.476
Whoa!

12:48.893 --> 12:50.353
Freak show, man.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.276
Queso fuerte! Come, everyone.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.821
Let us find out
what awaits through that door.

13:01.406 --> 13:02.240
Duchess?

13:02.323 --> 13:05.576
Ain't nobody here but us suits of armor.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.176
Ooh. This is spooky.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.309
There's no such thing as magic.
There's no such thing as magic.

13:30.393 --> 13:36.315
Oh, sure there is. You know that.
And this room feels positively full of it.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.360
Not helping, Arty.

13:41.279 --> 13:45.450
Perhaps my eyes deceive me.
These are the Eldritch sisters, yes?

13:46.784 --> 13:50.580
Here is Malviola, and, you know,
Malaranea. And here's Melissa...

13:50.663 --> 13:52.665
You're not even trying at this point.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.417
But this picture depicts a fourth one.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.668
What?

13:55.752 --> 13:57.378
A fourth Eldritch sister.

13:57.462 --> 14:00.757
A fourth Eldritch sister?

14:05.928 --> 14:09.515
No, no. No, no, no,
there's something wrong here.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.482
Terribly, terribly wrong. Duchess out!

14:30.161 --> 14:31.537
Enough with these games!

14:31.621 --> 14:35.083
Let us see whose face is hiding
beneath this old piece of junk.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.759
Whoa, no, no, no, no.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.804
This is getting real heavy,
real fast, man!

15:01.442 --> 15:02.443
Uh-oh.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.290
Whoa!

15:16.374 --> 15:19.752
Duchy, you're doing magic
without your soul bottles.

15:19.836 --> 15:20.962
Oh, that's so neat.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.296
It is not neat!

15:23.256 --> 15:25.550
Someone or something is controlling her.

15:31.222 --> 15:32.682
You missed again.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.481
Please do not be something terrible.
Please do not be something terrible.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.276
Oh, boy.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.677
Come on, Puss! Stick it to 'em!

16:09.760 --> 16:12.847
I am doing my...
Where did you get popcorn?

16:15.683 --> 16:16.684
Hmm?

16:23.900 --> 16:26.444
Whoa.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.338
Artephius! The wand!

16:51.010 --> 16:51.844
Uh-oh.

17:01.938 --> 17:02.980
Hmm?

17:09.194 --> 17:10.780
Puss.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.531
Puss!

17:13.031 --> 17:14.075
Fetch.

17:36.430 --> 17:39.183
Huh?

17:45.022 --> 17:45.856
Puss?

17:47.066 --> 17:47.900
Puss!

17:50.820 --> 17:52.363
Artephius.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.120
Sorry, Dulcie.
I just felt my true voice come out.

18:01.122 --> 18:05.293
Dulcinea, what a truly inspired idea.
You have saved the day.

18:05.376 --> 18:08.879
Why, thank you, Puss.
You want me to rub your belly?

18:08.963 --> 18:09.797
Very funny.

18:11.382 --> 18:15.344
This chamber. That...
That wand. I remember!

18:15.428 --> 18:19.015
I remember it all! The curse is broken.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.059
I am Maldonna!

18:22.143 --> 18:24.020
- Maldonna?
- Maldonna?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.605
Like, Maldonna?

18:25.688 --> 18:26.647
Maldonna!

18:26.731 --> 18:28.316
Our sister!

18:28.399 --> 18:30.776
Whoa! You're, like, back!

18:30.860 --> 18:33.821
Sister? The fourth Eldritch sister is you?

18:33.904 --> 18:37.408
But this does not make any sense.
For one thing, you are not invisible.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.620
And your name's Maldonna?

18:42.330 --> 18:46.959
I'm so sorry about attacking you.
That was the curse controlling me.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.044
What curse?

18:49.211 --> 18:50.421
Let me explain.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.174
When I was a young, beautiful witch,

18:53.257 --> 18:56.385
I decided to cash in
on my witchy upbringing.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.555
So I wrote a tell-all book
about myself and my sisters.

18:59.639 --> 19:03.017
My sisters were so angry
I'd given away all their secrets,

19:03.100 --> 19:05.394
that they placed a curse on our family.

19:05.478 --> 19:09.273
They erased everyone's memory,
including mine,

19:09.357 --> 19:12.777
of there having ever been
a fourth Eldritch sister.

19:13.903 --> 19:17.990
Yeah, that may have been
a bit of an overreaction on our part.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.411
We also took away
your ability to do magic.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.329
Malviola!

19:23.412 --> 19:25.623
What? I thought we were
in a safe space here.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.375
Besides, it's not like
we can't give it back.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.126
You can do that?

19:29.710 --> 19:31.128
Of course. I am a witch.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.900
Ha!

20:03.661 --> 20:04.745
Oh!

20:04.829 --> 20:06.747
Ooh, yes!

20:06.831 --> 20:08.749
Now, that, mama likes.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.127
Whoa. You've still got it, sis.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.337
Maldonna, please forgive us.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.631
If we'd known that
we'd miss you this much,

20:15.715 --> 20:17.174
we never would have enacted the curse.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.593
Except we didn't even know
who we were missing

20:19.677 --> 20:21.303
because the curse made us forget you.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.849
I've missed, like, a vague,
you-shaped blur.

20:24.932 --> 20:28.227
And you are that blur, man.
You're that blur!

20:28.310 --> 20:34.525
Oh, my dear sisters. I've missed you too.
Even if I didn't know it.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.112
Not gonna cry. Not gonna cry.

20:39.447 --> 20:43.159
Oh, I just love it when people
get their memories back.

20:43.242 --> 20:48.914
Oh, I wish I could forget everything
so that I could remember it later.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.082
Oh...

20:50.166 --> 20:52.334
And I forgot
what I was just talking about.

20:57.423 --> 21:01.260
The last piece of the Gem of the Crown.
Oh, thank you, Duchess!

21:01.343 --> 21:06.098
Huzzah! Our mission is accomplished,
and everything here is resolved.

21:06.182 --> 21:09.977
Let us celebrate with our new friends,
the Eldritch sisters!

21:10.728 --> 21:14.690
Wait. I still gotta get revenge on you,
kitty brother man.

21:14.774 --> 21:18.652
And hey, now that Maldonna
is, like, part of the crew again,

21:18.736 --> 21:23.073
we can all defeat him together.
Sisters, attack!

21:26.243 --> 21:29.330
- Ooh, butterflies!
- Ahem.

21:29.413 --> 21:32.291
Well, as much as I'd simply love
to hang around

21:32.374 --> 21:34.251
and participate in this... this...

21:34.335 --> 21:35.169
Let's go.

21:35.628 --> 21:39.173
What a good idea. Family reunions
are no place for violence.

21:40.925 --> 21:43.928
Come on, Duchy.
Let's boogie on out of here.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.387
Boogie, boogie, boogie!

21:46.680 --> 21:48.766
♪ Butterfly dance party ♪

21:50.351 --> 21:53.020
Ugh. Can we finally get ice cream now?

21:53.103 --> 21:57.441
I just can't believe it, Puss.
The Duchess is actually a witch.

21:57.525 --> 22:02.071
Well, may I remind you,
things are not always what they seem.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.447
Very true.

22:05.699 --> 22:10.079
Yes. For example, I may have seemed
to be acting like a dog earlier,

22:10.162 --> 22:11.872
but clearly, that was not the case.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.291
I am a cat,
and cats are wonderful animals,

22:14.375 --> 22:16.794
whereas dogs are terrible.
You agree, right?

22:16.877 --> 22:20.297
Yes, yes. Comical, no?

22:20.381 --> 22:22.550
You must swear to me
you will never tell anyone

22:22.633 --> 22:26.387
that I, Puss in Boots,
ever acted like a dog. Swear it!

22:26.637 --> 22:28.973
Okay.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.061
Don't worry, Puss, I can keep a secret.

22:36.230 --> 22:37.273
Here, boy.
