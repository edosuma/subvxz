WEBVTT

00:07.224 --> 00:09.052
Ooh. What's going on?

00:09.183 --> 00:10.401
Jay and Sam are interviewing
potential assistants.

00:10.532 --> 00:11.750
So far,
it's been a bunch of duds.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.361
I blame child labor laws.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.276
How are people supposed
to get experience

00:15.406 --> 00:17.539
when they're wasting
their youth in schools?

00:17.669 --> 00:20.890
Oh. Cornell University School
of Hotel Administration.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.154
And three years working
at the St. Regis Midtown.

00:24.285 --> 00:25.938
This is very impressive, Freddie.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.462
Mm, yeah.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.029
I just have one question
for you.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.552
You're at the airport.

00:30.682 --> 00:31.640
A gunman is using a hostage
for cover.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.381
What do you do?

00:33.511 --> 00:35.035
Ignore him.

00:35.165 --> 00:37.080
Look, you seem
very qualified,

00:37.211 --> 00:41.780
and no offense-- mainly to us--
but why do you want this job?

00:41.911 --> 00:43.391
Well, I'm from the area,
and I moved back recently

00:43.521 --> 00:45.306
to be near family.

00:45.436 --> 00:48.352
And it's always been my dream
to have my own B, so I thought

00:48.483 --> 00:49.701
why not learn from the best?

00:49.832 --> 00:51.268
The best?

00:51.399 --> 00:53.444
What fool would buy
this malarkey?

00:53.575 --> 00:55.446
The best. That's...

00:55.577 --> 00:56.708
Wow.

00:56.839 --> 00:58.406
Look, I read that rave

00:58.536 --> 01:00.582
about you guys
in <i>Sippr</i> last month.

01:00.712 --> 01:02.018
You're doing something right
here at Woodstone,

01:02.149 --> 01:03.933
and I just want
to be a part of that.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.805
And, Jay, you shoot the hostage.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.807
<i>Speed</i> is the perfect movie,

01:08.938 --> 01:11.506
and Mr. Keanu Reeves
is a national treasure.

01:11.636 --> 01:12.724
You're hired.

01:12.855 --> 01:13.812
I think Jay's in love.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.727
Oh. So am I.

01:15.858 --> 01:18.861
What?
So... am I...

01:18.991 --> 01:21.081
officially offering you the job?

01:21.211 --> 01:23.083
I think I am!

01:23.213 --> 01:25.085
Wow!

01:25.215 --> 01:26.434
What an interesting way
of phrasing that.

01:26.564 --> 01:29.654
So am I accepting the offer?
You betcha.

01:31.047 --> 01:33.571
So Sam and Jay
picked a third?

01:33.702 --> 01:35.182
Sure.

01:40.361 --> 01:43.103
Bjorn! Everything okay?

01:43.233 --> 01:45.583
I'm having situation
with other ghost.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.890
It's embarrassing!

01:48.020 --> 01:51.546
Son! Tell me
what troubles you!

01:52.634 --> 01:54.723
I'm getting bullied.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.377
What?!

01:56.507 --> 01:57.595
Bullied!

01:57.726 --> 01:59.510
I'm sorry,

01:59.641 --> 02:02.861
but it sound like you say
"bullied," which is impossible.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.385
Because you are mighty Viking.

02:04.515 --> 02:07.823
Who could bully mighty Viking?

02:07.953 --> 02:11.261
Oh, my God. Are you whining
to your daddy?

02:11.392 --> 02:12.480
No!

02:12.610 --> 02:14.525
Daddy,

02:14.656 --> 02:20.096
the mean 50s housewife
is being mean to me. Wah!

02:20.227 --> 02:22.533
That your bully?!

02:22.664 --> 02:26.320
- But she is... tiny woman!
- No.

02:26.450 --> 02:30.062
She normal size woman,
just tiny 'cause you far away.

02:30.193 --> 02:33.979
That was not
Thor's main issue with it.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.764
I don't understand.

02:35.894 --> 02:37.548
The gentleman hired to be Sam
and Jay's new assistant

02:37.679 --> 02:40.986
just left his companion out here
to wait in his vehicle. Hmm.

02:41.117 --> 02:42.205
I wonder if she's
his girlfriend.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.859
No way.
She's way too hot for him.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.339
Oh, my God.

02:45.469 --> 02:47.384
- Thank you.
- You can see us?

02:47.515 --> 02:49.212
Yeah, I'm a ghost.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.388
Ooh!

02:51.519 --> 02:53.564
Hey, y'all.

02:53.695 --> 02:56.001
I'm Jessica. How's it going?

02:56.132 --> 02:58.917
Hold on. What is happening?
Where did you come from?

02:59.048 --> 03:00.092
Uh, I'm a car ghost.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.398
What's a car ghost?

03:01.529 --> 03:02.834
I died in a car accident,

03:02.965 --> 03:04.488
so now I'm bound to this car.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.011
Well, this car and about...

03:06.142 --> 03:08.318
One, two, three, four...

03:08.449 --> 03:10.581
This car and about
a five-foot border.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.497
This is quite vexing.

03:13.628 --> 03:16.196
You simply go
wherever the vehicle goes?

03:16.326 --> 03:18.589
Yeah, but it's not bad,
for being dead.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.114
Um, Freddie does food delivery,
so I get to see the world

03:22.245 --> 03:23.986
and smell the smells.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.596
Does he deliver pizzas?

03:25.727 --> 03:27.903
All... the... time.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.818
Ooh.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.994
Sorry. I died buzzed.

03:32.124 --> 03:35.258
I was coming from a bottomless
mimosa brunch with my bitches.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.868
Bottomless alcoholic beverages?

03:36.999 --> 03:38.827
How does such an establishment
stay in business?

03:38.957 --> 03:40.742
Oh, well,
they water the drinks down,

03:40.872 --> 03:43.484
but, you know, if you drink
twice as many...

03:43.614 --> 03:46.095
Aah! Always forget
about my head wound.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.620
So, this is where we keep
the stapler and the stamps

03:49.751 --> 03:51.883
and the little reception bell
that we had to put away

03:52.014 --> 03:53.537
'cause Jay can't walk by it
without ringing it.

03:53.668 --> 03:54.973
Uh, you gonna
wrap this up soon?

03:55.104 --> 03:56.888
We got an afternoon walk.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.542
This is the guest book.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.109
Hello?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.285
Samantha, after our walk,

04:02.416 --> 04:03.982
will you open the curtain
in my room?

04:04.113 --> 04:06.246
I have plans to stare pensively
for several hours.

04:06.376 --> 04:07.986
Hello?

04:08.117 --> 04:09.379
She's still ignoring us.

04:09.510 --> 04:10.815
Well, this is untenable.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.600
How long
can this situation continue?

04:12.730 --> 04:14.950
Yeah, Sam. How often is
this guy going to be here?

04:15.080 --> 04:17.169
Freddie, I thought
I should let you know

04:17.300 --> 04:20.347
your hours are going to be 10:00
to 6:00 Tuesday through Sunday.

04:20.477 --> 04:23.350
- What?!
- If it's okay with you,
I'll be in early and leave late.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.221
That's not okay with us!

04:25.352 --> 04:27.397
Indeed. It's one thing when
she must refrain from responding

04:27.528 --> 04:29.138
during brief interactions
with the guests,

04:29.269 --> 04:30.705
lest she appear deranged.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.489
But all day, every day?

04:32.620 --> 04:34.056
That we cannot abide.

04:34.186 --> 04:36.319
Freddie, you know,
I'm going to take a walk

04:36.450 --> 04:37.973
around the grounds
to stretch my legs.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.062
Ooh, I'll come with you.

04:40.192 --> 04:41.585
Would love to familiarize myself
with the grounds

04:41.716 --> 04:43.370
so I could
better help the guests.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.588
Oh, get a damn life, Freddie!

04:47.069 --> 04:48.549
So Bjorn's being bullied

04:48.679 --> 04:50.551
by one of the other ghosts
at the Farnsby's?

04:50.681 --> 04:54.381
Normally, I would counsel Bjorn
to destroy enemy with violence,

04:54.511 --> 04:56.165
but can't do that
with woman, and,

04:56.296 --> 04:58.602
also, violence not affect ghost.

04:58.733 --> 05:04.913
Being father to adult ghost
baby son... very complicated.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.349
I hear you, buddy.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.785
Fatherhood.
It's not easy.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.526
But there's some good news.

05:09.657 --> 05:12.268
There's a simple solution
to Bjorn's problems.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.705
All he has to do
is use his words.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.099
Interesting.

05:17.229 --> 05:20.494
Use words
to inflict emotional violence.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.539
I like.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.237
No, that's not what I meant.
I meant to communicate.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.804
You know?
Talk to the bully,

05:26.935 --> 05:29.372
tell her how her words
are affecting Bjorn.

05:29.503 --> 05:32.375
Or let her know how dumb
her face looks.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.725
I don't think
that's what Pete's saying, Thor.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.597
Yes, but is better
than what Pete is saying,

05:36.727 --> 05:38.468
and comes from Pete's idea.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.340
Thor "yes and" Pete.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.646
Okay, do not use improv
for evil.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.300
That is the first rule
of improv.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.910
I thought
the first rule was

05:46.041 --> 05:47.564
always support
- your scene partner.
- Yes.

05:47.695 --> 05:51.002
Okay, love that you guys are
listening, but, Thor, please.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.222
Bullying back
is not the solution.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.181
Yes, and... it is!

05:56.312 --> 05:58.183
All right.

05:58.314 --> 06:01.361
Off to counsel Bjorn on how
to continue cycle of violence.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.667
Good talk!

06:03.798 --> 06:05.495
But probably one
of the best classes

06:05.626 --> 06:07.279
I took was
Beverage Management.

06:07.410 --> 06:09.934
Samantha, you have to see this!
There's a car ghost!

06:10.065 --> 06:12.110
Oh, my God!

06:12.241 --> 06:14.156
Is that a... Toyota?

06:14.286 --> 06:15.853
You don't see those every day.

06:15.984 --> 06:18.160
Really? I think they're
literally the most popular car.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.423
She's bound to the car.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.512
We've never seen
anything like it!

06:22.643 --> 06:24.471
Freddie, would you mind
covering the desk for a bit?

06:24.601 --> 06:26.255
Sure thing, boss.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.604
This is the Living we were
- telling you about.
- Oh, yeah.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.519
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hi. I'm Sam.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.261
So, you live in Freddie's car?
That's interesting.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.697
He seems like
a really great guy.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.612
Oh, yeah, he's so great.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.658
And you're his new boss, right?

06:37.788 --> 06:39.050
Yeah, we interviewed
a bunch of people,

06:39.181 --> 06:40.574
but he really
blew us away.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.010
To be honest,

06:42.140 --> 06:43.925
I can't believe
- he took the job.
- Yeah.

06:44.055 --> 06:46.710
He's the best. Although,
um, if he's working here,

06:46.841 --> 06:48.625
there is one thing that I feel
like you should know.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.236
- Oh, what?
- Um, he killed me.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.419
I-I'm sorry, what?
Freddie killed you?

06:59.549 --> 07:00.898
I thought you said
you died in a car accident.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.205
Yeah. A hit-and-run.
It was really sad.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.728
Well, Freddie doesn't seem
like the kind of guy

07:04.859 --> 07:06.208
who'd just drive away.

07:06.338 --> 07:07.992
Are you sure
he realized he hit you?

07:08.123 --> 07:09.777
Well, I flew
through the windshield

07:09.907 --> 07:11.692
and then he dumped my body
in the woods,

07:11.822 --> 07:13.520
so, yeah, I think he noticed.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.043
But I hear he types,

07:15.173 --> 07:16.436
like, a hundred words a minute,

07:16.566 --> 07:17.959
so, that's cool for you.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.701
- How did this happen?
- Um, I was at brunch

07:20.831 --> 07:22.529
with my bitches.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.139
Uh, we got kicked out because

07:24.269 --> 07:25.140
my bestie Lindsey puked
all over the waitress.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.577
- This is a vivid retelling.
- And

07:27.708 --> 07:29.057
I was walking across the street.

07:29.187 --> 07:31.973
Next thing I know, boom,
I'm getting hit by a car

07:32.103 --> 07:33.844
and flying through a windshield.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.411
Well, you look great
for a victim

07:35.542 --> 07:37.369
of blunt force head trauma.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.458
Oh, you're sweet.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.721
I need to talk to Jay.

07:43.114 --> 07:45.813
You really know your way
around that whetstone.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.250
Oh, I'm just here
to support your genius

07:48.380 --> 07:51.601
and allow you to concentrate on
that beautiful crème anglaise.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.603
Oh, my God,
he's got a knife!

07:53.734 --> 07:55.431
And Jay has a spoon!

07:55.562 --> 07:57.868
Uh, Jay, can I talk to you
in the hallway for a second?

07:57.999 --> 07:59.914
Yeah, sure.
Freddie, can you...?

08:00.044 --> 08:01.481
Stir for three minutes
then remove from heat?

08:01.611 --> 08:04.309
This guy. He's killing it.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.051
Oh, you have no idea.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.400
What is it, babe?

08:08.531 --> 08:09.837
Jay,

08:09.967 --> 08:11.795
Freddie killed someone
in a hit-and-run,

08:11.926 --> 08:13.493
- and was never caught.
- What?

08:13.623 --> 08:15.146
How do you know this?

08:15.277 --> 08:16.321
Because the ghost of that
person, a woman named Jessica,

08:16.452 --> 08:18.193
lives in Freddie's SUV,

08:18.323 --> 08:20.238
which is currently parked
in our driveway.

08:20.369 --> 08:22.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.720
This dead Jessica lady just goes
wherever the car goes?

08:23.851 --> 08:25.417
Jay, that's not
the key point here.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.158
It is fascinating, though.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.073
- What are you doing?
- Adding this to my Ghost Notes.

08:29.204 --> 08:31.859
This is huge. So,
is the actual car the boundary,

08:31.989 --> 08:33.208
or does it extend to,
like, a perimeter?

08:33.338 --> 08:34.601
- Oh.
- I don't know!

08:34.731 --> 08:36.907
Boundary unknown.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.648
S-So, what do we do?
Do we call the cops?

08:38.779 --> 08:40.737
Yes, yes, call the authorities!

08:40.868 --> 08:43.479
And tell them what? A ghost
told us Freddie's a murderer?

08:43.610 --> 08:45.394
Yeah, that doesn't sound great.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.439
At the very least,
you must fire Freddie.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.964
The ghosts are saying
we need to fire Freddie.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.835
I mean, if he actually did that,

08:51.966 --> 08:53.533
that's really bad.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.056
- Yeah.
- Cut and dried.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.753
- Give him the heave-ho!
- It will mean

08:56.884 --> 08:58.015
a return
to slightly more work

08:58.146 --> 08:59.887
for the two of you,
but you'll be able

09:00.017 --> 09:01.628
to speak freely
to us once again,

09:01.758 --> 09:04.108
which is a trade-off
I, for one, am willing to make.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.240
He was just

09:05.370 --> 09:07.242
- such a good assistant.
- The best.

09:07.372 --> 09:09.200
Oh, Lord, here comes
the rationalizing.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.289
The truth is, anybody could
have done what he did.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.857
Yeah. You know,
I ran over a cone

09:13.988 --> 09:15.206
in that grocery store
parking lot,

09:15.337 --> 09:17.121
and that could have been
a tiny orange person.

09:17.252 --> 09:18.209
Totally.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.211
Oh, for God's sake.

09:20.342 --> 09:21.735
You cannot simply overlook
the fact that he killed someone

09:21.865 --> 09:23.040
just because

09:23.171 --> 09:24.651
he knows how
to fold a towel into a swan.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.654
But we probably would have
stopped and reported it.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.960
Also, Jessica did
sort of mention

09:30.091 --> 09:31.179
that Freddie dumped her body
in the woods.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.007
Ooh, that's hard to get past.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.051
I mean,
that's a string of decisions.

09:34.182 --> 09:36.140
We have to get rid of him,
don't we?

09:36.271 --> 09:37.838
Yeah.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.970
Hey, Jay, just wanted
to let you know

09:40.101 --> 09:41.581
I went ahead
and created a digital backup

09:41.711 --> 09:42.799
of all your recipe cards.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.671
The archive
is searchable

09:44.801 --> 09:48.283
by flavor profile, protein type
and country of origin.

09:48.413 --> 09:49.937
Of course it is.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.117
Father?!

09:58.206 --> 09:59.903
Father!

10:01.035 --> 10:04.386
Hey, Bjorn, I'm Pete!

10:04.516 --> 10:05.430
I'm a good friend

10:05.561 --> 10:06.910
of your dad's!

10:07.041 --> 10:08.303
Let me go get him for you,

10:08.433 --> 10:09.696
okay?!

10:12.568 --> 10:15.179
Actually, if you don't mind me
asking, h-how's that bullying

10:15.310 --> 10:16.833
situation going?

10:16.964 --> 10:19.923
He told you?! How embarrassing!

10:20.054 --> 10:21.838
Oh, no, don't be embarrassed.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.232
I-I was bullied constantly
as a kid.

10:24.362 --> 10:25.799
My mom says it was

10:25.929 --> 10:28.105
'cause I was special
and the other kids were jealous,

10:28.236 --> 10:32.414
which was not true,
but comforting nonetheless.

10:32.544 --> 10:37.114
Father says I should be mean to
Judy, but it doesn't feel right!

10:38.202 --> 10:40.204
Here's the thing, Bjorn!

10:40.335 --> 10:44.600
Your dad means well, but
that doesn't necessarily mean

10:44.731 --> 10:46.515
that's the best advice
to follow!

10:46.646 --> 10:49.170
Well, what is best advice?!

10:49.300 --> 10:52.260
I think just
communicate honestly!

10:52.390 --> 10:55.742
Tell her how her behavior
is making you feel!

10:55.872 --> 10:56.960
What do you think
you're doing?

10:57.091 --> 10:58.875
Thor, I was just
looking for you.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.181
I-I was just
coming to get you

11:00.311 --> 11:02.487
because B-Bjorn was
looking for you.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.315
No, you weren't.

11:04.446 --> 11:08.450
You're trying to replace me
as father to my Baby Bjorn!

11:08.580 --> 11:10.147
No, no, not at all.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.628
You say I shouldn't
listen to father?!

11:12.759 --> 11:14.761
Pete, is that right?

11:14.891 --> 11:17.024
- Not now, Bjorn!
- Okay!

11:17.154 --> 11:19.983
Just want to be clear. You say

11:20.114 --> 11:22.203
listen to you
and not my father.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.728
He's-he's joking.
He's a funny kid.

11:25.859 --> 11:29.819
We talk after <i>Housewives.</i>

11:32.779 --> 11:34.258
Why are you doing this?

11:34.389 --> 11:36.086
I thought
everything was working out.

11:36.217 --> 11:39.002
It's just not
the right fit.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.091
Is this because
of the Diet Coke I took?

11:41.222 --> 11:43.528
Jay said I could help myself.

11:43.659 --> 11:46.662
Yes, it is the Diet Coke.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.969
You did something unforgiveable,

11:49.099 --> 11:50.840
and I hope
it keeps you up at night.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.496
So what's it gonna be
for you and Freddie now?

11:54.626 --> 11:58.152
Guess we're gonna go back to the
open road and food deliveries.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.806
Well, that works out
pretty well for you.

11:59.936 --> 12:03.592
We get our Samantha back, so,
seems like everybody wins. Hmm.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.985
What's going on?

12:05.115 --> 12:06.551
Oh, uh, Sam and Jay
are getting rid

12:06.682 --> 12:08.336
of Freddie,
cause, you know, the murdering.

12:08.466 --> 12:11.992
Oh. So, I guess that means
you're going to be...

12:12.122 --> 12:14.951
Leaving, yeah.
I know it sucks, but, um,

12:15.082 --> 12:16.823
maybe we'll still
see each other, you know,

12:16.953 --> 12:18.563
if like your Livings, like,
order a burrito or something.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.479
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, totally.

12:21.610 --> 12:24.656
I just feel like I didn't really
get a chance to know you.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.267
Like, do you have a ghost power?

12:26.397 --> 12:29.357
Um, well, kind of.
I can set off the car alarm.

12:29.487 --> 12:31.054
Whoa. How?

12:31.185 --> 12:32.752
I have the keys.
Here, I'll show you.

12:34.318 --> 12:35.580
- Oh!
- Oh. Ooh, wow.

12:37.365 --> 12:38.496
Wait.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.324
Why do you have the keys
to this car?

12:40.455 --> 12:41.238
What?

12:41.369 --> 12:42.544
Well, you said you got hit

12:42.674 --> 12:43.980
when you were walking
across the street.

12:44.111 --> 12:46.374
Yes, isn't this Freddie's car?

12:46.504 --> 12:48.855
Uh... yeah.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.639
Okay.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.859
Can totally see where

12:52.989 --> 12:55.035
you guys are getting confused.

12:55.165 --> 12:57.167
See, what happened was,
after I was hit,

12:57.298 --> 12:59.343
I flew through
the windshield,

12:59.474 --> 13:01.911
and the force of the accident
made Freddie's keys

13:02.042 --> 13:05.262
fly up and land in my pocket.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.612
Mm, that does not make
any sense at all, my dear.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.049
- Mm-mm.
- No.

13:09.179 --> 13:12.182
Okay, you know what?

13:12.313 --> 13:14.271
I'm too buzzed
to pull off these lies.

13:14.402 --> 13:17.448
Uh, Freddie didn't kill me.

13:17.579 --> 13:20.712
I was driving the car,
and I ran into a telephone pole,

13:20.843 --> 13:23.280
which came out of nowhere.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.848
And Freddie bought the car used
a few years ago.

13:25.979 --> 13:28.633
So, that means Samantha is
firing that poor young man

13:28.764 --> 13:29.896
for no reason.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.462
- Well, we need to tell her.
- No!

13:31.593 --> 13:32.594
Please don't, okay?

13:32.724 --> 13:34.378
I miss the open road,

13:34.509 --> 13:36.119
and the smell
of chicken tikka masala

13:36.250 --> 13:37.817
wafting through the car.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.732
That's why I lied--
just to get back to that life.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.256
Let's not forget,
with Freddie out of the picture,

13:42.386 --> 13:43.997
we do get Sam
- all to ourselves.
- True.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.694
But at what cost, guys?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.043
What about this poor guy,
accused of a terrible crime,

13:47.174 --> 13:48.610
about to lose his job
for no reason?

13:48.740 --> 13:51.961
Please, Sass, for me?

13:52.092 --> 13:53.441
Yeah, okay.

13:53.571 --> 13:54.834
Oh, there you go.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.837
Mom, hey, listen, I got fired.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.577
I know it's just
been one day.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.623
I don't want to talk about it.
I'll pick up some Arby's?

14:01.753 --> 14:05.061
Because that's what I do now,
Mom-- pick up food.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.323
That's all I'm good for.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.108
Oh, yes!

14:08.238 --> 14:11.372
Arby's Horsey Sauce, baby!

14:14.462 --> 14:17.247
We're doing the right thing.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.162
A sauce made from horses.

14:25.690 --> 14:26.996
I'm so sorry,
Mrs. Greenstein.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.650
I didn't see the note
about your kosher meal.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.304
- Oy gevalt!
- Oy gevalt!

14:30.434 --> 14:32.088
We have a new system, and
I'm still getting used to it.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.917
The toilet paper triangles
won't stay, Sam.

14:35.048 --> 14:36.745
They won't stay!

14:36.876 --> 14:38.181
I'm kind of drowning here.

14:38.312 --> 14:39.661
Freddie installed
all these new systems,

14:39.791 --> 14:41.315
and he didn't get a chance
to walk me through them.

14:41.445 --> 14:43.056
This isn't good.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.188
The sounds of Freddie crying
and phoning in that Arby's order

14:45.319 --> 14:47.321
are going to haunt me
for a long, long time.

14:47.451 --> 14:49.236
Stay strong, my friends.

14:49.366 --> 14:50.802
Oh, before I forget, we need

14:50.933 --> 14:52.282
to cancel our dinner
reservation tomorrow night.

14:52.413 --> 14:55.633
Our date night? I was really
looking forward to that.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.592
What is this?
Date night?

14:57.722 --> 14:59.724
It's a thing that modern couples
do to reconnect.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.248
We were gonna go out
for a nice dinner.

15:01.378 --> 15:03.380
It's been months,
but with Freddie not here,

15:03.511 --> 15:04.904
somebody has to stay
for the guests.

15:05.034 --> 15:07.689
Stupid murderer.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.387
Okay. I can't do this.
We have to tell Sam

15:10.518 --> 15:11.649
that Freddie didn't
kill anyone.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.521
That we know about!

15:14.304 --> 15:16.480
Ugh. All right, fine.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.616
Samantha, funny story.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.010
Turns out Freddie didn't
actually kill the car ghost.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.837
What?!

15:25.968 --> 15:27.709
Jessica was driving
and got in an accident.

15:27.839 --> 15:28.579
After brunch

15:28.710 --> 15:30.364
with her bitches,

15:30.494 --> 15:31.669
which, apparently,
is a term of endearment.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.671
The point is,
Freddie didn't kill her.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.238
Why would you lie to me?!

15:35.369 --> 15:37.762
We never actually lied.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.808
It was more of a sin
of omission,

15:39.939 --> 15:41.766
if one wanted
to get technical.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.203
We missed you!

15:43.333 --> 15:44.378
With Freddie around,
you were ignoring us.

15:44.508 --> 15:46.032
We didn't want to share you.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.425
If you think about it,

15:48.556 --> 15:49.861
it's actually very sweet.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.298
Feel free to "aw"
if you're so moved.

15:51.428 --> 15:52.995
Guys, one of the reasons

15:53.126 --> 15:55.519
that we were getting
an assistant was to free us up.

15:55.650 --> 15:58.044
Yes, there was a breaking-in
period, but eventually,

15:58.174 --> 15:59.567
I would have been
more available.

15:59.697 --> 16:02.526
That was not
communicated clearly.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.399
Jay, we need
to get Freddie back.

16:05.529 --> 16:08.532
Yes! I completely agree.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.578
Who cares
if the guy killed somebody?

16:10.708 --> 16:12.797
He can organize the hell
out of a pantry.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.843
What?! No. No,
Freddie didn't kill anyone.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.845
The car ghost
was lying.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.891
Even better.
Let's get the bastard back.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.679
"Bastard" is a term
of endearment?

16:24.809 --> 16:27.160
What has become
of the lexicon?

16:27.290 --> 16:29.814
<i>Hey, Thor, what's up?</i>

16:29.945 --> 16:31.773
<i>Housewives</i> over.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.689
Now why do you go
behind Thor's back?!

16:34.819 --> 16:37.257
I think
Pete just wanted to help, Thor.

16:37.387 --> 16:38.780
Like an uncle.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.434
That's what uncles do.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.566
They give you advice
and buy you weed,

16:42.697 --> 16:44.481
and stare too long
at your friends.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.483
Do you think Thor bad father?

16:46.614 --> 16:48.398
And that you better father

16:48.529 --> 16:50.487
because you actually got
to be father?

16:50.618 --> 16:52.272
No, no, not at all.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.752
I-I just understand what Bjorn
is going through, okay?

16:54.883 --> 16:57.407
Yeah. I know. I heard.

16:57.538 --> 16:58.713
You were bullied, too.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.410
But that doesn't excuse.

17:00.541 --> 17:04.110
No. I-I... I mean, because...

17:04.240 --> 17:05.981
my dad was a lot like you,

17:06.112 --> 17:08.114
Thor-- a distant tough guy...

17:08.244 --> 17:10.159
Thank you.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.205
...who pushed me to solve
my problems through aggression,

17:12.335 --> 17:13.684
and I hated it

17:13.815 --> 17:15.773
because I wasn't
that kind of kid.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.906
But your father was
trying to help you.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.864
But he wasn't listening to me.

17:19.995 --> 17:22.954
I-I didn't want
to fight fire with fire.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.826
I-I just wanted a dad
who accepted me

17:24.956 --> 17:26.654
and understood who I was.

17:26.784 --> 17:29.178
Thor have idea.

17:29.309 --> 17:32.921
Maybe Thor accept Bjorn,

17:33.052 --> 17:36.664
let Bjorn be who he is.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.883
So, kind of just what I said?

17:39.014 --> 17:40.233
It's slightly different.

17:40.363 --> 17:43.497
Okay. Just glad
you got there.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.890
Ah... Ooh, what's all this?

17:46.021 --> 17:47.936
It's a pile of burritos.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.590
Freddie isn't responding

17:49.720 --> 17:51.331
to any Sam and Jay's
calls and texts.

17:51.461 --> 17:52.723
So, Samantha and Jay
are repeatedly

17:52.854 --> 17:54.160
placing orders in the hopes

17:54.290 --> 17:56.466
that one of them
shall be delivered by Freddie,

17:56.597 --> 17:58.164
thus allowing them
to apologize and win him back.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.904
Unfortunately,
drivers other than Freddie

18:00.035 --> 18:02.864
keep appearing, which has led
to this comical, yet aromatic,

18:02.994 --> 18:05.214
mountain of burritos.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.390
Damn it.
That wasn't Freddie, either.

18:07.521 --> 18:08.957
Sam, what are you going
to do with all of these?

18:09.088 --> 18:11.133
Well, have a safe trip home,
Mrs. Greenstein.

18:11.264 --> 18:15.224
And enjoy your complimentary
kosher veggie burrito.

18:15.355 --> 18:18.532
Jay, this is getting
very expensive.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.882
Maybe we should just
throw in the towel.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.318
Here's your burrito.

18:22.449 --> 18:23.711
Hey! Freddie!

18:23.841 --> 18:25.147
What are the odds?!

18:25.278 --> 18:26.888
I didn't even want to come.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.498
I just need
to keep my rating high

18:28.629 --> 18:29.978
since this is my only form
of income right now.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.415
I threw in a Diet Coke
so now we're even.

18:32.546 --> 18:33.808
My God, the drama.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.680
Wait. Freddie?

18:36.811 --> 18:38.682
Look, we, uh...

18:38.813 --> 18:41.772
we overreacted,
and we're sorry.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.557
We're-we're not
used to being bosses.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.776
But-but I've gotten
a chance to sleep on it,

18:45.907 --> 18:48.779
and, you're right--
it was just a Diet Coke.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.433
That you said I could have.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.435
Freddie, we could go round
and round on this thing,

18:52.566 --> 18:55.525
but you know what?
The point is, we want you back.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.224
Wait.

18:58.354 --> 19:01.531
Did you order, like, 50 burritos
just to talk to me?

19:01.662 --> 19:04.317
Yes. Yes, we did.

19:04.447 --> 19:05.753
But you guys are, like, broke.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.624
Okay, every tenth one was free.

19:07.755 --> 19:10.845
That is... so sweet.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.542
Crazy,

19:12.673 --> 19:13.978
but sweet.

19:14.109 --> 19:16.720
So, does this mean
you're coming back?

19:16.851 --> 19:18.461
I want three of those burritos.

19:18.592 --> 19:21.290
Push that leverage, young man.
Gouge 'em!

19:21.421 --> 19:22.900
You got it.

19:23.031 --> 19:26.817
Well, then, you guys got
yourself a new old assistant.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.732
Oh, Freddie's back.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.473
I think I'll just go outside
for some fresh air.

19:30.604 --> 19:31.996
Ah, I'll come with you.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.389
- Please don't.
- Ooh!

19:33.520 --> 19:35.261
Don't get poked by that glass

19:35.391 --> 19:37.132
sticking out of her forehead
if you kiss her!

19:43.443 --> 19:44.270
Bjorn, I was wrong to try

19:44.400 --> 19:46.185
to make you do things my way.

19:46.315 --> 19:48.448
From now on, I listen

19:48.578 --> 19:51.494
and accept you
for who you are, my son!

19:51.625 --> 19:54.628
I'm so happy
to hear that, Father!

19:54.758 --> 19:58.022
And good news--
it went really well.

19:58.153 --> 20:02.549
Turns out, Judy only bully
because she have crush on me.

20:02.679 --> 20:04.899
Yes, my boy!

20:05.029 --> 20:07.075
How was the sex?

20:08.337 --> 20:10.948
We haven't done that yet,
- Father.
- Right.

20:11.079 --> 20:13.168
Because we have not
had the talk yet.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.517
So,

20:14.648 --> 20:16.693
you know how sword
go into sheath?

20:16.824 --> 20:18.391
He's fathered children, Thor.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.393
I think he knows
how it works.

20:20.523 --> 20:23.918
With Dane, maybe,
but with person, different.

20:24.048 --> 20:26.747
Just let him have
- his moment, Pete.
- Okay.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.444
So, your body is going
through lots of changes.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.446
This is good!
