WEBVTT

00:10.076 --> 00:12.579
Hey, you're looking
a little under the weather.

00:12.579 --> 00:14.214
You all right?

00:14.214 --> 00:16.015
He most certainly is not.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.317
He dined on that
lovely can of bacon fat

00:17.317 --> 00:18.545
you've been hiding
under the sink.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.054
Aw, geez. Poor little guy.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.222
(doorbell rings)

00:22.222 --> 00:25.725
You know bacon grease
is bad for dogs.

00:25.725 --> 00:29.217
Ironic, considering its vast
health benefits for humans.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.722
Hello.
Hi, guys.
Hello.

00:34.234 --> 00:35.223
Hey.
Sorry
we're late.

00:35.735 --> 00:36.736
Well, that's all right.

00:36.736 --> 00:38.238
We're not having
lunch until 1 :1 5.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.739
Oh, great.

00:39.739 --> 00:41.604
Oh, long night, Niles?

00:42.042 --> 00:44.411
Oh, a bit. We were out
at a party last night.

00:44.411 --> 00:46.106
At Bill Gates' house.

00:48.081 --> 00:49.070
Really?

00:51.051 --> 00:54.354
Some sort of
charity event?

00:54.354 --> 00:57.050
Oh, no, just a few
people over for dinner.

00:58.358 --> 01:00.223
His wife has
been following

01:00.560 --> 01:02.118
Maris's case, and she
wanted to meet us.

01:04.129 --> 01:06.633
It seems the story's
captured everyone's imagination.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.134
People want to get
the inside scoop.

01:08.134 --> 01:09.536
Their house
is enormous.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.371
I got lost
going to the loo,

01:11.371 --> 01:14.272
but a voice in the wall
guided me back.

01:17.277 --> 01:18.778
Sounds like fun.

01:18.778 --> 01:19.767
Anyway, I thought
after lunch

01:20.280 --> 01:21.281
we might stop
by the museum

01:21.281 --> 01:22.782
for the Goya exhibit.

01:22.782 --> 01:24.284
Actually, we're going

01:24.284 --> 01:27.087
tomorrow night with
the Blenkinsops.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.721
Tomorrow? But...

01:28.721 --> 01:30.690
the museum's
closed tomorrow.

01:30.690 --> 01:33.318
Not for Bunny
and Bruce.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.196
Well. Oh.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.198
With all the rarefied elbows
you've been rubbing lately,

01:38.198 --> 01:40.200
I'm surprised you could
find the time for lunch

01:40.200 --> 01:41.201
with a commoner like me.

01:41.201 --> 01:43.829
Oh, now, stop, but if
we could get going,

01:44.337 --> 01:45.839
I have a perfume launch at 4:00.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.340
Oh.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.329
(doorbell ringing)

01:50.343 --> 01:53.847
It's a pretty lady
holding some mail.

01:53.847 --> 01:57.317
Oh, you didn't pull
that trick again, did you?

01:57.317 --> 01:59.285
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:59.686 --> 02:02.689
Step aside. Don't let her
slip it under the door.

02:02.689 --> 02:03.690
Hello.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.191
Hi. Sorry to disturb you.

02:05.191 --> 02:06.681
Some of your mail
got mixed in with mine.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.193
Oh, dear. How
did that happen?

02:08.193 --> 02:10.697
Some of it just seemed
to be jammed in there.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.198
Uh-huh.

02:12.198 --> 02:13.700
Really? Well, you know,

02:13.700 --> 02:15.702
we must make allowances
for our mailman.

02:15.702 --> 02:16.600
He's a veteran.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.873
So, uh...

02:19.873 --> 02:21.407
my name's Dr. Frasier Crane.

02:21.407 --> 02:22.876
Caroline Harwich.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.377
Nice to meet you,
and this is my family.

02:24.377 --> 02:25.366
My father, Martin Crane.

02:25.879 --> 02:26.379
Hi.

02:26.379 --> 02:27.380
My sister-in-law, Daphne,

02:27.380 --> 02:29.382
and my brother, Niles.

02:29.382 --> 02:31.384
You look awfully familiar.
Have we met?

02:31.384 --> 02:32.886
I am somewhat
of a media figure.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.387
No, your brother.

02:34.387 --> 02:37.379
Oh, you're Niles Crane
from that big murder case.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.256
I saw you on the news.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.561
Mmm. He's been on
three times this week.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.263
He's practically famous.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.565
Oh, well...
hardly famous.

02:45.565 --> 02:48.268
Yes, my brother doesn't like
to toot his own horn.

02:48.268 --> 02:51.271
You know, I was discussing that
very personality type today

02:51.271 --> 02:53.262
on my very popular radio show.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.268
Oh, right, right--
Dr. Frasier Crane.

02:55.575 --> 02:56.269
Yes.

02:56.576 --> 02:57.577
Yes, my mother listens to you.

02:57.577 --> 02:59.579
Oh.

02:59.579 --> 03:02.282
Well, anyway, it was
nice meeting you all.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.283
Yes, likewise.
Take care.
Bye-bye.

03:03.283 --> 03:05.285
Yes, bye.

03:05.285 --> 03:06.582
You know, isn't it nice to know

03:07.287 --> 03:08.922
there are still
honest people in the world?

03:08.922 --> 03:11.391
How come your mail
never gets mixed up

03:11.391 --> 03:12.759
with that sweaty
fat guy's upstairs?

03:12.759 --> 03:14.750
We should, we should
really be running along.

03:15.261 --> 03:16.763
Yes, yes, you know, I'm afraid

03:16.763 --> 03:18.253
we'll have to be
lunching at Vindaloo.

03:18.765 --> 03:19.766
I couldn't get us in
at le Toque.

03:19.766 --> 03:20.767
Mmm...

03:20.767 --> 03:22.200
Oh, n...

03:22.268 --> 03:23.836
Well, you know,
maybe I should call.

03:23.836 --> 03:26.339
I've had the best luck
with restaurants lately.

03:26.339 --> 03:29.342
Well, they swore that they were
absolutely booked solid.

03:29.342 --> 03:30.843
Oh, dear.

03:30.843 --> 03:32.345
Hello. Yes, wondering
if you could possibly

03:32.345 --> 03:34.336
squeeze in three
for lunch today?

03:34.847 --> 03:36.583
That's Dr. Crane.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.318
No, actually Niles.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.320
Oh, how lovely.
Thank you.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.378
We'll see
you in a bit.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:53.233 --> 03:53.933
Oh, hey, Fras.

03:53.933 --> 03:54.922
Oh, hi.

03:55.435 --> 03:56.436
I'm so sorry
about the show.

03:56.436 --> 03:57.937
I was a little
distracted.

03:57.937 --> 04:00.940
Oh, yes, I sensed that
when you patched through Wanda,

04:00.940 --> 04:02.942
who wanted to know
what our soup of the day was.

04:02.942 --> 04:06.446
My sister Denise is in town.
I hate it when she visits.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.948
She isn't happy until she make
me feel completely miserable.

04:08.948 --> 04:11.451
Do you know what
she called my place?

04:11.451 --> 04:13.953
"Cozy. "

04:13.953 --> 04:14.954
Well, that's a compliment.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.945
No, it's code for
smaller than hers.

04:17.457 --> 04:18.958
Cappuccino, please.

04:18.958 --> 04:20.949
She wraps every insult up
in a compliment.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.463
When I try to call
her on it, she just says,

04:23.463 --> 04:25.465
"Hon, I was trying to be nice.

04:25.465 --> 04:26.955
You're so
sensitive. "

04:27.467 --> 04:30.459
And of course everything
in her life is so perfect.

04:30.970 --> 04:32.472
Her home,
her husband,

04:32.472 --> 04:36.976
her stretch of highway
she keeps clean.

04:36.976 --> 04:38.466
She's so competitive.

04:38.978 --> 04:39.967
Mmm.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.481
Well, if it's
any comfort,

04:41.481 --> 04:44.473
Niles has been perfectly
insufferable of late.

04:44.984 --> 04:48.988
This whole Maris affair has
gained him some mild notoriety.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.991
He's been flaunting it
like a tattered boa.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.994
I'm trying to do the right thing
and rise above it, of course,

04:54.994 --> 04:56.496
but there are times
when I just want

04:56.496 --> 04:57.997
to step on his feet--
and hard, too.

04:57.997 --> 04:58.998
Ooh.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.500
Denise!

05:00.500 --> 05:01.501
Frasier, hi.
Hello, Denise.

05:01.501 --> 05:02.502
How are you?

05:02.502 --> 05:03.870
Good to see you.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.439
Well, you are looking
very distinguished.

05:06.439 --> 05:07.740
Thank you.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.442
That's code for old.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.744
i know.

05:11.744 --> 05:14.747
Oh, i am so
sorry i'm late.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.749
Craig called.

05:16.749 --> 05:18.751
The poor thing,
he misses me so much

05:18.751 --> 05:21.447
it's just impossible
to get him off the phone.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.456
i hope this makes it up to you.

05:23.456 --> 05:26.759
Now, Roz, i know
you love your sportswear,

05:26.759 --> 05:29.462
but trust me, men like women

05:29.462 --> 05:32.465
who wear dresses
once in a while.

05:32.465 --> 05:33.454
So you've said.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.768
Denise, you having
fun on your trip?

05:35.768 --> 05:37.470
Oh, yes. Staying with Roz

05:37.470 --> 05:38.771
is always so much fun--
it's sort of like camping.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.773
(phone ringing)

05:40.773 --> 05:42.475
Ooh.

05:42.475 --> 05:43.464
Hello?

05:44.777 --> 05:46.472
it's my contractors.

05:46.779 --> 05:49.771
Take my advice-- never
build a pool house.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.486
Oh, hon, i picked us up
a Seattle magazine

05:53.486 --> 05:56.478
so we can find some
fun things to do this week.

05:57.490 --> 05:58.791
Does that include rolling it up,

05:58.791 --> 05:59.792
turning it sideways and...

05:59.792 --> 06:01.794
Now, Roz.

06:01.794 --> 06:03.496
At least she's trying.

06:03.496 --> 06:04.793
She did get you
a gift, after all,

06:05.498 --> 06:07.800
and look, it's very chic,
and expensive, i'm sure.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.495
And two sizes too small.

06:09.802 --> 06:10.496
All right, she's a bitch.

06:10.803 --> 06:11.792
Thank you.

06:12.805 --> 06:15.508
Hey, hey,
it's Mr. Sea Bees.

06:15.508 --> 06:16.805
The nominations
are in?

06:17.510 --> 06:17.805
Yeah, two of them.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.500
Oh, Roz!
Yay!

06:19.812 --> 06:21.814
Actually, Roz,
they're both for Frasier

06:21.814 --> 06:23.516
You're up for Best Host

06:23.516 --> 06:25.518
and Best informational Special

06:25.518 --> 06:28.510
which gives you the lifetime
record for most nominations.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.456
Oh, my God! i'm...

06:30.456 --> 06:31.657
i'm so flattered.

06:31.657 --> 06:33.159
i hope you two will
join me at my table?

06:33.159 --> 06:34.660
Ugh, those awards
are endless.

06:34.660 --> 06:35.661
They're torture.

06:35.661 --> 06:36.662
Can i bring my sister?

06:36.662 --> 06:37.651
Of course.

06:39.665 --> 06:43.169
Oh, look. it's Niles.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.671
You going to tell him you
broke the SeaBees record?

06:45.671 --> 06:47.173
if it comes up.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.675
You know, Doc, we should
take advantage of this thing.

06:49.675 --> 06:52.178
i got a friend at the Seattle
Times who owes me one.

06:52.178 --> 06:54.180
i could ask him to write
a big profile on you.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.670
Thank you, no, Kenny.

06:56.182 --> 06:59.685
let others engage in that sort
of shameless self-promotion.

06:59.685 --> 07:01.687
i'm not interested in playing
that sort of game.

07:01.687 --> 07:02.688
Oh, Niles.

07:02.688 --> 07:04.679
Hi. listen, Frasier,
i'm so sorry.

07:05.191 --> 07:06.692
i have
to cancel tonight.

07:06.692 --> 07:09.195
i-i-i'm going to go
hear Tony Bennett.

07:09.195 --> 07:11.197
Oh. Really? Really,
where's he playing?

07:11.197 --> 07:14.200
At Frank Gehry's
birthday party.

07:14.200 --> 07:18.204
Well, speaking
of glamorous parties, Niles...

07:18.204 --> 07:19.694
Oh, no,
is that Seattle magazine?

07:20.206 --> 07:21.696
i was hoping
you hadn't seen it.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.209
Seen what?

07:23.209 --> 07:24.710
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

07:24.710 --> 07:27.201
it's a silly thing
. it's page 30.

07:28.714 --> 07:29.715
Oh, it's one of those

07:29.715 --> 07:31.717
"What's Hot- What's Not"
lists. i love these.

07:31.717 --> 07:32.718
"Heirloom
tomatoes, hot.

07:32.718 --> 07:33.719
Sun-dried
tomatoes, not... "

07:33.719 --> 07:35.721
Give me that.

07:35.721 --> 07:38.724
Ha-ha.

07:38.724 --> 07:40.726
"Dr. Niles Crane, hot.
Dr. Frasier Crane... "

07:40.726 --> 07:42.216
Well, you see where
they're going with this.

07:44.230 --> 07:45.731
Well, we'll just see
who's not hot

07:45.731 --> 07:47.221
when the winter/spring edition

07:47.733 --> 07:49.235
of Seattle Broadcaster
comes out.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.237
For your information,
Niles, i have recently...

07:51.237 --> 07:52.738
Excuse me.
i'm so sorry for this.

07:52.738 --> 07:54.240
i'm going to
get some coffee.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.241
Oh, dear. Oh...

07:55.241 --> 07:56.242
Oh.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.244
Hello. Hello, Daphne.

07:58.244 --> 08:01.747
A delivery from Bill and Mindy?

08:01.747 --> 08:03.237
Aren't they sweet?

08:03.749 --> 08:04.750
(sighs)
No.

08:04.750 --> 08:05.739
Don't uncrate it
till i get home.

08:10.189 --> 08:11.190
Kenny, about
that article.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.692
Way ahead of you, Doc.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.627
No, he'll make
for a great profile.

08:14.627 --> 08:17.630
SeaBees record holder,
doctor, big ladies' man--

08:17.630 --> 08:19.131
the whole ball of wax.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.622
Uh, well, you can
ask him yourself.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.639
Hello. Yes, well
, when would be agood time for you?

08:26.639 --> 08:28.641
Oh, i've just had
the greatest idea.

08:28.641 --> 08:32.144
What if you interview me while
we're at the SeaBee Awards?

08:32.144 --> 08:33.645
Yes, it'll be
a freewheeling chat

08:33.645 --> 08:36.649
against a glittering backdrop.

08:36.649 --> 08:40.653
Splendid. i will
see you anon.

08:40.653 --> 08:42.154
Hey.

08:42.154 --> 08:45.146
No, he always talks like that.

08:45.658 --> 08:48.160
Why are you
taking him to the SeaBees?

08:48.160 --> 08:50.162
Because i want him
to see me at my best, Roz.

08:50.162 --> 08:52.164
Do your realize, i'm giving
the opening remarks this year,

08:52.164 --> 08:55.167
and if i do say so myself,
they will change you.

08:55.167 --> 08:57.658
Yeah, from an awake person
to a sleeping one.

08:58.671 --> 09:01.140
(gasps) Perfect.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.631
All i was lacking
was the appropriate piece
of arm candy to accompany me

09:04.143 --> 09:05.144
and there she is.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.145
Who's she?

09:06.145 --> 09:08.147
it's a neighbor of
mine in the building

09:08.147 --> 09:09.148
whose acquaintance
i have recently made.

09:09.148 --> 09:10.137
Oh, right. Daphne told me

09:10.650 --> 09:12.641
you pulled that old mail
trick out of moth balls.

09:14.153 --> 09:15.154
Caroline.

09:15.154 --> 09:17.156
Frasier, hello.

09:17.156 --> 09:18.157
Hi. Good to see you.

09:18.157 --> 09:20.148
Cappuccino, to go.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.649
Thank you so much
for those flowers.

09:22.161 --> 09:23.651
Oh, gosh, it was
the least i could do

09:24.163 --> 09:25.164
after that stumblebum
of a mailman

09:25.164 --> 09:26.666
made you do his job for him.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.135
Oh, i'd send him a complaintit.
letter if i'd think he'd get

09:29.135 --> 09:30.659
(laughing)

09:31.137 --> 09:32.138
That's delightful.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.139
Uh, listen, uh...

09:33.139 --> 09:34.640
i hope this isn't too bold,

09:34.640 --> 09:38.144
but you see, i've been nominat
for a broadcast award,

09:38.144 --> 09:39.645
twice actually,
and i was... well,

09:39.645 --> 09:43.149
there's a, there's a black
-tgala on Saturday night.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.639
i was hoping you
could accompany me.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.641
Why, thank you. i'd love to.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.644
Fantastic. i'll pick
you up around 7:30.

09:51.657 --> 09:54.660
Well, i worked
my magic.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.162
That magnificent creature

09:56.162 --> 09:58.164
will be accompanying
me on Saturday night.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.655
Frasier, the awards
are Saturday morning.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.336
What? Of course they're not.

10:04.837 --> 10:05.838
Yes, they are.

10:05.838 --> 10:08.306
Who would plan an awards
ceremony on a Saturday morning?

10:08.808 --> 10:11.299
Kenny was in charge this year.
He booked the room too late.

10:12.745 --> 10:13.713
See you this weekend.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.704
Oh... Yeah, bye-bye.
Uh... right.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.016
Oh, oh, don't forget--

10:17.016 --> 10:19.719
i'll pick you up,
7:30 Saturday morning.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.016
Bye-bye.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.726
Saturday morning?

10:26.726 --> 10:28.027
Yes, Yes. Did i...?

10:28.027 --> 10:30.723
i did mention
that, didn't i

10:31.030 --> 10:33.733
Oh, gosh. it-it seems
the SeaBees are to be

10:33.733 --> 10:36.035
a cheery breakfast
event this year.

10:36.035 --> 10:37.737
but the good news is, actually,

10:37.737 --> 10:39.038
i'll be able
to get you home by noon.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.740
Bye-bye.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.041
Yeah, i don't think that's
going to work for me.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.810
i have Pilates on Saturdays.

10:44.810 --> 10:50.750
Oh, gosh, i wish you'd
said something sooner.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.047
i'm sorry. Bye-bye.

10:52.752 --> 10:53.741
Yeah.

10:54.053 --> 10:55.755
Oh, you can't
blame her, Frasier.

10:55.755 --> 10:58.691
Who wants to get into hair and
makeup at 8:00 in the morning?

10:58.691 --> 11:00.993
Well, somebody better.
i'm being profiled.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.995
it's gonna looke
like i can't even scare up a date

11:02.995 --> 11:04.986
You scared that one pretty good.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.443
Cindy, where are you?

11:17.443 --> 11:19.445
listen, this thing's
about to start.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.947
Well, i'm sorry
you broke your heel,

11:21.947 --> 11:24.950
but can't you just put o
n a different pair of shoes?

11:24.950 --> 11:28.454
Oh, your actual heel. Ouch.

11:28.454 --> 11:32.958
Well, uh... feel better.

11:32.958 --> 11:33.947
(sighs)

11:34.393 --> 11:37.396
Roz, are you sure
this dress didn't fit you?

11:37.396 --> 11:39.899
Because i'm just
swimming in it.

11:39.899 --> 11:41.389
Two Bloody Marys, please.

11:41.901 --> 11:42.902
And there's a
20 in it for you

11:42.902 --> 11:43.903
if one of
them's poisoned.

11:43.903 --> 11:45.771
i don't even
care which one.

11:45.771 --> 11:46.772
There's a face
i'm happy to see.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.074
Frasier.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.775
Not you, Roz.
Denise, listen.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.777
Could you do me
a small favor?

11:51.777 --> 11:53.768
,
You see, my date
didn't show up

11:54.080 --> 11:55.781
and there's a reporter
here today

11:55.781 --> 11:57.783
doing a story on me.

11:57.783 --> 11:58.943
Could you pretend
to be my date?

11:59.385 --> 12:03.481
Well, sure. First,
the valet hits
on me, and now this.

12:03.889 --> 12:04.753
Hi, guys.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.226
Some spread.
i got pigs in a blanket

12:07.226 --> 12:08.761
lying on an omelet pillow.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.864
And check it out--
it snowed cheese.

12:11.864 --> 12:15.234
Oh, Roz, larry Gamba
couldn't make it.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.169
So, if he wins, can
you accept for him?

12:17.169 --> 12:18.771
Sure, Kenny. Nothing
takes the sting

12:18.771 --> 12:20.272
out of not
being nominated

12:20.272 --> 12:22.274
like accepting an award
for my former intern.

12:22.274 --> 12:25.277
Now, Roz,
don't frown.

12:25.277 --> 12:28.075
Those lines
don't go away.

12:28.848 --> 12:29.849
Oh, hey there!
Randy! Over here!

12:29.849 --> 12:30.850
This is
the reporter.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.852
Here he is--
the Doc himself.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.154
This is Roz Doyle,
his ace producer.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.156
And this is my dad,
Martin Crane.

12:37.156 --> 12:39.158
Dad, could you
move over one?

12:39.158 --> 12:41.160
Thank you, Kenny.
Here we are.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.162
And i'd like you
to meet my date,

12:43.162 --> 12:45.865
the lovely and talented
Denise Dawson.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.867
Oh, honey, stop it.

12:47.867 --> 12:48.856
it's a pleasure
to meet you.

12:49.168 --> 12:50.870
Very nice.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.861
So, i'm so glad
you could join us

12:53.172 --> 12:54.440
on our gala morning.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.442
is this thing always so early?

12:56.442 --> 12:58.444
No. But, then,
the SeaBees has always been

12:58.444 --> 12:59.945
the wayward maverick
of award shows.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.448
in fact, i plan
to touch on that

13:02.448 --> 13:04.450
in my opening remarks,

13:04.450 --> 13:06.452
while hewing
to my original theme

13:06.452 --> 13:09.555
of communication as the engine
of social progress.

13:09.555 --> 13:11.056
Sounds great.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.547
Could i get a big cup
of coffee, please?

13:15.995 --> 13:18.631
What's Niles doing here?
i gave him Ronee's ticket.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.901
She said she hated to miss it,
but she didn't want to come.

13:21.901 --> 13:24.301
Hello, i'm sorry i'm late.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.305
i had to distribute
some sound bites.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.973
That's quite all right,Dr. Crane.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.475
i'm very excited to meet you.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.476
Randall Schoonover
of the Seattle Times.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.545
He's doing
Oh. Hello.

13:32.545 --> 13:35.047
a profile of me:
"A Day in the life
of Dr. Frasier Crane. "

13:35.047 --> 13:37.016
But if there's
anything you'd like
to tell my readers...

13:37.016 --> 13:38.108
Oh, uh... thank you.

13:38.517 --> 13:39.950
i'm just here
to support my brother.

13:40.352 --> 13:41.854
"Supports
his brother. "

13:41.854 --> 13:43.355
(music begins playing)

13:43.355 --> 13:44.857
Oh! Well, i guess
it's time

13:44.857 --> 13:47.348
for me to give
my opening remarks.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.862
You just, uh...

13:49.862 --> 13:53.354
sit tight, and i'll
be back in 20 minutes.

13:56.368 --> 13:57.870
You want
to give me a cue

13:57.870 --> 13:59.360
so i know when
to play you offstage?

13:59.872 --> 14:01.874
Ah! You will
feel the pace quicken

14:01.874 --> 14:03.709
as i build
to my climax:

14:03.709 --> 14:06.212
a grim verbal picture of
the world without broadcasting.

14:06.212 --> 14:08.614
Just tell me
the last words.

14:08.614 --> 14:10.673
i'll say, "Thank you. "

14:14.520 --> 14:16.121
Good morning.

14:16.121 --> 14:19.124
i'm Dr. Frasier Crane,
and it is my great honor

14:19.124 --> 14:21.627
to stand before you,
my fellow luminaries,

14:21.627 --> 14:24.619
and welcome you to
the Seattle Broadcasting Awards.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.866
i hope to do justice

14:26.866 --> 14:29.960
to the dignity
of this most august occasion.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.377
i've been asked
to inform everyone

14:38.377 --> 14:41.175
that we are running low
on sausage...

14:43.415 --> 14:45.317
so if you would please
limit yourselves

14:45.317 --> 14:49.219
to one link or patty.

14:49.889 --> 14:50.890
Thank you.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.491
(band plays)

14:52.491 --> 14:53.958
But i'm not finished.

14:54.426 --> 14:55.484
Thanks, Frasier.

14:55.928 --> 14:57.327
Oh... oh, thank you.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.365
Now...

14:59.365 --> 15:01.390
who wants to hand out
some hardware?

15:02.935 --> 15:04.334
Angela DiStefano...

15:06.238 --> 15:08.672
Keith Meebly...

15:10.442 --> 15:12.411
and Chet Hardy,

15:12.411 --> 15:14.402
the legendary host
of "it's Your Dime. "

15:16.949 --> 15:18.007
So many greats this year.

15:18.317 --> 15:21.020
This is for you, my dear.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.021
(phone rings)

15:22.021 --> 15:24.012
Hello.

15:24.323 --> 15:27.026
Oh, hi, Craig.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.324
Honey, i've got to take this.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.327
Oh. Okay.
Hurry back, love.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.534
So, Randall, where were we?

15:35.534 --> 15:37.036
Your brother was
just telling me

15:37.036 --> 15:39.538
how Maris is
coping with jail.

15:39.538 --> 15:42.441
So is it true that Maris
tried to break out?

15:42.441 --> 15:44.109
Oh, no, no, no.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.445
Her eyebrow pencil
simply rolled
out of her cell,

15:46.445 --> 15:48.113
and she went to get it.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.410
it's really
the jail's fault

15:50.115 --> 15:51.412
for making those bars
so far apart.

15:53.319 --> 15:56.088
This is really
my brother's day though.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.181
And now the nominees for
Best informational Special.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.125
Doc, this is you.

16:04.229 --> 16:08.400

16:08.400 --> 16:10.002

16:10.002 --> 16:12.371

16:12.371 --> 16:14.236
And the winner is...

16:17.209 --> 16:18.437
Riley Austin.

16:24.016 --> 16:27.315
i'm just going to track down
some Sweet'N low.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.989
Well, Niles, you should have
powdered your nose

16:29.989 --> 16:31.980
if you planned to spend
so much time in my spotlight.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.087
i was just making conversation.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.190
Well, stop it.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.428
Knock it off, you two.

16:36.428 --> 16:38.130
if you can't share
this reporter,

16:38.130 --> 16:39.119
i'm going to ask him
to leave.

16:39.398 --> 16:42.101
Roz, get ready. This
is larry's category.

16:42.101 --> 16:44.370
i can't believe
that this happened.

16:44.370 --> 16:45.371
No, it-it's all right.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.739
i-i'm still up for Best Host.

16:46.739 --> 16:50.209
Craig... He's leaving me.

16:50.209 --> 16:51.543
What?

16:51.543 --> 16:54.213
He met someone else.

16:54.213 --> 16:56.238
i can't believe this is happening to me.

16:56.515 --> 17:00.474
And the winner
is larry Gamba for KACl.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.521
KENNY:
Roz, get up there.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.522
This is so terrible.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.058
i know, i know.

17:06.058 --> 17:08.193
How would you know
what it's like

17:08.193 --> 17:09.694
to lose a husband, Roz?

17:09.694 --> 17:11.195
You never even had one.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.531
Accepting the award
is Roz Doyle.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.329
(sobbing)

17:16.435 --> 17:19.104
Um, thanks, Plum.

17:19.104 --> 17:21.402
Um... larry
couldn't be here today,

17:21.707 --> 17:23.208
but if he were here,

17:23.208 --> 17:25.778
he would say, um...

17:25.778 --> 17:27.108
Yes!

17:28.414 --> 17:30.582
Thank you, God!

17:30.582 --> 17:33.419
Yes! This is the best day

17:33.419 --> 17:34.420
of my entire life!

17:34.420 --> 17:36.088
i-i've just been
waiting for this

17:36.088 --> 17:38.424
since i was a little girl!

17:38.424 --> 17:39.425
Yes!
(music playing)

17:39.425 --> 17:42.094
You have no idea
how much this means to me!

17:42.094 --> 17:43.391
Yes!

17:46.098 --> 17:48.396
Thank you. Thank you so much.

17:50.135 --> 17:51.432
i hate men.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.140
Now, now, Denise...

17:55.140 --> 17:57.131
Shut up.
You're all the same.

17:57.643 --> 17:58.132
No, listen, Denise,
i know...

17:58.644 --> 18:01.238
Get your hands off me!
Stop it!

18:03.148 --> 18:05.514
There's no need for
you to write that down.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.320
And now the nominees
for Best Radio Call-in Host.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.189
Better get ready,
Doc-- this one has
your name on it.

18:10.189 --> 18:12.624
Well, it better, because this
whole show has been a nightmare,

18:12.624 --> 18:14.293
not that it actually
could be a nightmare,

18:14.293 --> 18:15.494
because it's mid-morning.

18:15.494 --> 18:19.298
And the SeaBee goes to...

18:19.298 --> 18:22.668
the late Chet Hardy,
for "it's Your Dime. "

18:22.668 --> 18:24.169
(music plays)

18:24.169 --> 18:25.158
MARTiN:
Sorry, son.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.406
You can't beat
a dead guy.

18:27.406 --> 18:30.466
Dead. That's
the best kind of guy.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.743
i think maybe
i have enough.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.313
Uh, no, pl-pl-please
don't go.

18:34.313 --> 18:36.648
Uh, listen, the show'll
be over very soon.

18:36.648 --> 18:38.650
They actually have a Bat Mitzvah
booked for noon,

18:38.650 --> 18:40.652
so maybe we can finish up
in the lobby.

18:40.652 --> 18:42.321
Okay, i'll get my coat
.
Thank you.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.323
i hope you can
join us, Niles.

18:44.323 --> 18:45.312
Oh, uh...

18:46.658 --> 18:48.961
Don't you dare.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.131
You have been monopolizing
that man's time all morning.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.367
You should be thanking
me for distractinghim from this circus.

18:55.367 --> 18:58.165
You should talk--
You've been the ringmaster
of your own media circus

18:58.504 --> 19:00.172
for the last week.
And it's just killing
you, isn't it?

19:00.172 --> 19:03.164
if you think i am jealous
of your tawdry notoriety,

19:03.509 --> 19:05.170
then you don't know
who i am.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.146
Just like most of the
people in this city.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.135
You go too far!

19:09.148 --> 19:11.343
(woman screams)

19:13.318 --> 19:14.686
Doc, that's Jerry Edwards.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.381
He's supposed to close
the show.

19:16.688 --> 19:17.677
is he all right?

19:18.323 --> 19:19.691
Oh, no,

19:19.691 --> 19:21.326
you knocked
his glass eye out.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.328
You're going to have
to close the show.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.317
What?
Well,

19:24.696 --> 19:26.331
you took him out...
and you'll be the only guy

19:26.331 --> 19:28.700
in history to open
and close the SeaBees.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.292
Really?

19:31.336 --> 19:33.839
Nobody's ever
done it before?

19:33.839 --> 19:35.704
But i don't have
anything prepared.

19:35.807 --> 19:37.442
Don't worry, it's all
on the TelePrompTer.

19:37.442 --> 19:40.741
Now get up there and sing.
it's to the tune of Moon River.

19:41.847 --> 19:45.284
Ooh, think i just
kicked something.

19:45.284 --> 19:47.878
("Moon River" playing)

19:50.756 --> 19:56.361
The SeaBees
now are at an end

19:56.361 --> 20:02.267
We hope you've made
a friend or two

20:02.267 --> 20:04.603
And the SeaBees

20:04.603 --> 20:07.406
Have great freebies

20:07.406 --> 20:09.397
Just pick up your bag

20:09.908 --> 20:11.739
At the door to your right

20:12.110 --> 20:13.612
Found it!

20:13.612 --> 20:14.613
That's an olive.

20:14.613 --> 20:18.276
The SeaBees

20:18.617 --> 20:21.286
We hope your day was great

20:21.286 --> 20:25.657
And yes, we validate--
right there

20:25.657 --> 20:33.432
See Rico, Eduardo or Jen

20:33.432 --> 20:35.968
They'll bring it
round the bend

20:35.968 --> 20:38.604
A Hyundai or a Benz

20:38.604 --> 20:51.608
The SeaBees are through.
