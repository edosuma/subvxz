02:03.765 --> 02:06.002
Give him a rubdown and
plenty of feed. Yes, sir.

02:06.069 --> 02:08.655
Logan Stuart's the name.
Thanks, Mr. Stuart.

02:30.138 --> 02:31.415
Damp day.

02:32.123 --> 02:34.065
How's Jacksonville?
Lively.

02:38.620 --> 02:41.108
Credit to account?
I'll take that specie.

02:41.181 --> 02:43.123
We're short of cash
at the diggings.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.724
What time do you open
in the morning?

02:44.797 --> 02:45.877
Tomorrow's Sunday.

02:45.949 --> 02:47.291
Then put the specie
in the saddle bags

02:47.358 --> 02:49.660
and I'll come by for it
before you close tonight.

02:49.727 --> 02:51.767
You must have
around 7,000 here.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.109
That's no trinket to be left
lying loose around a hotel room.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.663
Gold is only yellow gravel,
Cornelius.

02:56.736 --> 02:58.908
Yes, but the yellow color
makes all the difference.

02:58.976 --> 03:01.530
Butter's yellow, too, and
you can spread it on bread.

03:01.602 --> 03:03.293
Ever try that with gold?

03:03.362 --> 03:05.599
For a business man,
you've got odd ideas.

03:05.666 --> 03:07.968
If I were a banker,
as I shall be some day,

03:08.067 --> 03:10.621
I'd set you down as unsound
and lend you nothing.

03:10.692 --> 03:14.434
A man can choose his own gods,
Cornelius. What are your gods?

03:15.044 --> 03:16.222
What?

03:36.392 --> 03:37.767
Damp day.

03:40.073 --> 03:41.983
Let me see that.
Yes, sir.

03:44.042 --> 03:46.596
It's a beautiful little
locket. It came from England.

03:46.667 --> 03:47.845
I'll take it.

03:47.915 --> 03:51.047
A fortunate young lady, whoever
she is. Anything else, sir?

03:51.147 --> 03:55.371
Yes, I need some dry clothes, shirt,
socks, everything from the skin out.

04:17.616 --> 04:19.853
Hey, Logan! Come here.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.107
How are you, McLane?

04:28.179 --> 04:30.383
Fine. Just the man I want to see.

04:30.451 --> 04:32.524
What are the Indians doing
down your way this year?

04:32.596 --> 04:34.090
So far, quiet and uncertain.

04:34.164 --> 04:35.474
Whiskey?
Whiskey.

04:35.925 --> 04:37.102
Whiskey.

04:37.717 --> 04:41.133
<i>Logan, I've got a consignment of
general hardware from the brig Alice</i>

04:41.206 --> 04:44.054
to be delivered to Clay
& King at Jacksonville.

04:44.119 --> 04:47.250
It's cloth, rope,
tin dishes, buckets.

04:47.798 --> 04:49.424
I'm shipping by boat
to Salem.

04:49.495 --> 04:50.673
Do you want to
pack it from there?

04:50.743 --> 04:51.921
How many mules will it make?

04:51.991 --> 04:54.163
Oh, 20, I suppose.
What's your freight?

04:54.232 --> 04:55.694
Three dollars a mule
per day.

04:55.768 --> 04:56.880
Agreeable.

04:58.745 --> 05:00.688
It'll be in Salem on the
20th. Two more of the same.

05:00.762 --> 05:02.071
Not for me.
I've got to see

05:02.137 --> 05:04.309
if I can get a load of windows
hauled out to Gales Creek.

05:04.378 --> 05:05.720
Windows?
Windows with glass?

05:05.786 --> 05:07.063
We're becoming civilized.

05:07.131 --> 05:08.855
Oh, Bob. Bob Miller.

05:10.843 --> 05:12.949
Lumber's selling sky-high
in San Francisco.

05:13.020 --> 05:16.185
You sure enough will make
a handsome profit, Captain.

05:17.853 --> 05:19.893
Miss Lucy Overmire arrived?

05:19.966 --> 05:22.520
<i>In Room 10. Just off the
Cascades boat. Thanks.</i>

05:22.591 --> 05:24.249
She's been asking
for George Camrose.

05:24.319 --> 05:25.912
We got through all right.

05:26.143 --> 05:30.550
But the train back of us, 50
wagons, not a one of them left.

05:37.537 --> 05:39.326
Come in, George.

05:42.882 --> 05:44.704
Why, Logan!
Hello, Lucy.

05:45.218 --> 05:47.455
Oh, George had to make a
sudden trip to Crescent City.

05:47.523 --> 05:49.857
He knew I was coming up, so he
asked me if I'd bring you home.

05:49.924 --> 05:52.739
Will you mind having me
on your hands, Logan?

05:53.765 --> 05:55.172
That was a foolish question.

05:55.237 --> 05:56.798
You don't mind
having women on your hands.

05:56.869 --> 05:58.113
Where did you get that?

05:58.181 --> 05:59.294
Rumor.

06:00.134 --> 06:01.923
George Camrose, I bet.

06:02.598 --> 06:04.093
Oh, have you got
stout clothes?

06:04.167 --> 06:07.167
I want to get started before
daylight and the weather's foul.

06:07.239 --> 06:08.646
I don't mind.

06:09.608 --> 06:11.266
How was your visit
up at The Dalles?

06:11.336 --> 06:12.449
Quiet.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.808
Oh, Logan, there were a lot of
cattle abandoned by the emigrants.

06:15.881 --> 06:17.703
You could probably get them
for very little.

06:17.769 --> 06:19.679
Did you see any mules?
No.

06:21.930 --> 06:23.873
Well, five o'clock then,
and dress warm.

06:23.947 --> 06:26.249
We'll make Salem the first day
and Toms River the second.

06:26.315 --> 06:28.258
We should be in Jacksonville
Friday afternoon,

06:28.331 --> 06:30.699
unless that's traveling
too fast for you.

06:30.764 --> 06:31.746
No.

06:32.972 --> 06:35.461
I suppose you're going down
to play a little poker now.

06:35.533 --> 06:37.420
I guess not. Good night.

06:39.886 --> 06:41.348
A woman, Logan?

06:53.905 --> 06:55.913
I kept open for you.
Thanks.

07:00.883 --> 07:02.344
<i>I was just reading
in the Advertiser</i>

07:02.418 --> 07:03.628
they've completed
a suspension bridge

07:03.698 --> 07:06.033
across Niagara Falls for the
railroad. Well, that's progress.

07:06.099 --> 07:08.140
Out our way, we haven't
even got a stagecoach yet.

07:08.212 --> 07:10.830
Well, you've got
to have the roads first.

07:12.661 --> 07:13.937
Maybe it's
the other way around.

07:14.005 --> 07:17.169
Get the stagecoaches and
there'll be plenty of roads.

07:17.462 --> 07:20.277
Well, from
a banking viewpoint,

07:20.438 --> 07:23.057
I'd want to be sure
there were roads there first!

07:23.127 --> 07:24.109
What's that?

07:24.183 --> 07:26.485
I said, from
a banking viewpoint, I'd...

07:28.439 --> 07:30.644
Oh, poohdaddle!

07:41.595 --> 07:43.057
Come in, Logan.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.790
You see,
it wasn't a woman.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.005
Why didn't you say so then?

07:50.076 --> 07:51.799
You're marrying George,
not me.

07:51.868 --> 07:54.739
What have you got in the
saddle bags? Gold coin.

07:54.813 --> 07:56.756
You know, I was watching you
from the window.

07:56.830 --> 07:58.390
There was a man standing
at the corner of Alder

07:58.461 --> 07:59.803
as you passed
and he followed you.

07:59.871 --> 08:01.332
Don't worry about it.

08:01.406 --> 08:03.447
Good night, Lucy.
Good night.

09:04.492 --> 09:07.078
Logan! What happened?

09:07.148 --> 09:08.709
A bad try. He got away.
Who was it?

09:08.781 --> 09:10.570
I have an idea it was Bragg.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.230
He had an arm
like a chunk of oak.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.440
You're hurt!
I'm all right.

09:16.783 --> 09:18.758
Lucy, you better get
out of here.

09:18.831 --> 09:20.423
Go on to bed
and get some sleep.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.535
We're leaving at five sharp.

09:38.547 --> 09:41.581
What makes you so sure
it was Bragg up in Portland?

09:41.652 --> 09:42.994
He might have trailed me.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.653
He's had me on his mind
for quite awhile,

09:44.724 --> 09:46.929
ever since those two miners
were killed over at Evans' Ferry.

09:46.997 --> 09:48.491
The ones
the Indians murdered?

09:48.565 --> 09:49.743
Indians?

09:50.069 --> 09:51.313
I was out on the road
that morning

09:51.381 --> 09:54.284
and I saw Bragg come out of
the willows running his horse.

09:54.358 --> 09:57.490
A few minutes later, I
stumbled onto the two bodies.

09:57.687 --> 09:59.378
I could've had him hanged
for it and he knows it.

09:59.447 --> 10:02.066
Why didn't you?
That was rather careless.

10:02.136 --> 10:03.794
I didn't see him do it.

10:03.864 --> 10:06.384
You wouldn't want to hang a man
if there was the slightest doubt.

10:06.456 --> 10:08.017
No, you wouldn't.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.147
Things have got to be dead even
with you, is that it, Logan?

10:23.803 --> 10:25.080
Ease up there!

10:29.597 --> 10:32.413
Easy, easy.

10:33.662 --> 10:35.517
Where're you from?
Salt Lake.

10:35.582 --> 10:38.300
No good back there anymore.
Too populated.

10:38.367 --> 10:40.702
Get over here!
Get over here!

10:41.600 --> 10:43.094
Come on!

11:22.473 --> 11:23.717
How are things along the way?

11:23.785 --> 11:26.720
One miner was killed last
night over at Graves Creek.

11:26.793 --> 11:27.971
Indians?

11:29.674 --> 11:31.103
Are you game
to make a night ride of it?

11:31.178 --> 11:32.739
We'll reach Ben Dance's
by daylight.

11:32.811 --> 11:33.891
Fine.

12:45.113 --> 12:47.186
Howdy, Logan! Come on in.

12:48.762 --> 12:50.518
Tired?
Dead.

12:50.586 --> 12:51.928
Go along in.

12:52.251 --> 12:53.233
Hello, Mr. Dance.

12:53.307 --> 12:55.195
Morning, Miss Lucy.
Breakfast is awaiting.

12:55.259 --> 12:57.812
Asa, come out here
and get these horses!

12:57.884 --> 13:00.024
Hi, Logan!
Hi, Logan!

13:00.637 --> 13:02.971
<i>"Hi, Logan"? "Mr. Stuart,"
you young varmints.</i>

13:03.038 --> 13:05.886
Now rustle off them horses
and give them a good feed.

13:05.950 --> 13:08.154
Well, how'd you find things
on the way down?

13:08.222 --> 13:09.399
Not too bad.

13:09.469 --> 13:11.095
Had a little trouble
over at Graves Creek.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.054
One miner was killed.
Yeah, Indians.

13:13.118 --> 13:16.894
They got a Cavalry outfit under some young
lieutenant combing the canyon for them.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.421
But I got a little bet
with myself

13:18.496 --> 13:21.082
he'll get bushwhacked first
off. He don't know Indian style.

13:21.152 --> 13:22.232
Why didn't you
tell him, Ben?

13:22.304 --> 13:24.028
You can't tell them
army fellows nothing.

13:24.097 --> 13:25.242
They got a little brown book.

13:25.313 --> 13:28.762
If it ain't in that little
brown book, it just ain't true.

13:29.890 --> 13:31.319
How was Portland, Logan?

13:31.394 --> 13:33.020
A thousand people
and raining.

13:33.091 --> 13:36.125
How can anyone live in such
a crowd? Come and eat, Lucy.

13:36.195 --> 13:38.170
I couldn't eat a thing,
Mrs. Dance.

13:38.244 --> 13:40.285
What she needs
is some sleep.

13:40.965 --> 13:43.551
Well, hello, Caroline.
How are you, Logan?

13:43.749 --> 13:45.211
Oh, I don't think
you two are acquainted.

13:45.286 --> 13:48.004
Lucy, this is Caroline Marsh.
Lucy Overmire.

13:49.383 --> 13:51.107
I've heard about you.

13:51.239 --> 13:52.516
I'm so sorry
about your father.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.274
I brought you something
from Portland.

13:54.343 --> 13:55.903
Did you? What?

13:56.039 --> 13:57.895
If you have on your best
Sunday dress around noon time,

13:57.960 --> 13:59.651
I'll give it to you.

14:01.609 --> 14:03.202
Will you fix a bed
for Lucy, dear?

14:03.273 --> 14:04.222
We traveled all night.

14:04.297 --> 14:06.981
And when you travel
with Logan, you travel.

14:07.081 --> 14:08.391
Come along.

14:14.284 --> 14:17.034
I thought maybe she'd be
on her way back to England.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.147
What for?

14:18.220 --> 14:21.702
Her folks come out here to
start a new life for themselves.

14:21.805 --> 14:25.767
She's not the sort to give up just
'cause the Indians killed her pa.

14:25.838 --> 14:27.594
It's a joy
having her around, Logan.

14:27.662 --> 14:29.092
We always
wanted a daughter.

14:29.166 --> 14:30.181
Sure.

14:30.255 --> 14:31.565
But like
all good-looking daughters,

14:31.632 --> 14:34.502
it don't look like we're
going to keep her long, Ma.

14:35.536 --> 14:39.050
Logan... I mean, Mr. Stuart, do you
think the Indians will break out?

14:39.121 --> 14:40.331
It's always possible, Asa.

14:40.401 --> 14:43.303
A peace treaty don't seem to mean
nothing to them Rogue beasters.

14:43.377 --> 14:46.574
Well, it's their land and we're
on it and they don't forget it.

14:46.641 --> 14:48.136
Things'll be all right,
I reckon,

14:48.210 --> 14:50.120
unless some medicine man
stirs them up

14:50.194 --> 14:52.464
or some white cuss
starts something.

14:52.531 --> 14:54.571
You'll know it beforehand,
they'll get insolent.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.684
That's the time to fort up.

14:57.076 --> 14:59.859
Well, this is my fort
and darned if I budge.

15:00.501 --> 15:01.843
That's right, Ben.

15:31.163 --> 15:34.066
Ma is sending Caroline
over to McGarry's place.

15:34.140 --> 15:36.344
Mrs. McGarry's
come to her time.

15:37.660 --> 15:40.050
Now, there's everything
you'll need, dear.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.198
You want me to send Dr.
Balance back from Jacksonville?

15:42.270 --> 15:43.546
I can do
whatever's necessary.

15:43.614 --> 15:45.108
Oh, for sure,
it's only a baby.

15:45.182 --> 15:47.070
You stay at
McGarry's tonight, Caroline.

15:47.134 --> 15:49.436
I'll be over tomorrow
and ride back with you!

15:49.503 --> 15:51.675
Give my hellos
to your ma, Lucy.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.686
Say I'm lonesome for talk.

15:57.344 --> 15:58.654
Bye, Logan!

16:14.596 --> 16:16.898
Hey!
You ain't got much time!

16:17.541 --> 16:19.680
Well, here's where
I leave you.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.881
It takes me
back to England.

16:30.951 --> 16:32.512
It's just like
my grandmother's.

16:32.584 --> 16:34.177
Hey! Come on!

16:35.112 --> 16:36.389
Thank you.

16:41.002 --> 16:43.523
Oh, Logan, there's a
cabin-raising Saturday week.

16:43.594 --> 16:45.285
Liza Stone and
Gray Bartlett are marrying.

16:45.354 --> 16:46.784
I'll be there.

16:50.988 --> 16:53.094
You'd have had your kiss
if I hadn't been here.

16:53.165 --> 16:55.653
Yes. I'm sorry I caused you to miss it.

16:59.181 --> 17:00.905
But what's any woman
to you?

17:00.973 --> 17:03.941
You're never happy
except when you're on the go.

17:04.462 --> 17:08.618
I guess I'm just stuck on this
Oregon or maybe I'm just ambitious.

17:09.391 --> 17:11.334
I want to see a Stuart
& Company pack outfit

17:11.407 --> 17:13.349
stringing along
every road.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.714
And when stages come,
I want them to be my stages.

17:17.457 --> 17:20.589
Is that what makes you so
restless and discontented?

17:21.650 --> 17:23.538
Or is it a woman, Logan?

17:23.922 --> 17:25.865
Must it always be a woman?

17:32.756 --> 17:36.554
<i>Take me to
the Rogue River Valley</i>

17:36.661 --> 17:37.839
<i>Valley</i>

17:37.910 --> 17:42.733
<i>Where the silvery
moonlight shines</i>

17:42.807 --> 17:46.898
<i>Some one waits for me
in the valley</i>

17:47.703 --> 17:51.795
<i>There among
the blue-tipped pines</i>

17:52.536 --> 17:54.925
<i>She'll be by the river</i>

17:55.065 --> 17:57.204
<i>Where all heaven beams</i>

17:57.273 --> 17:59.794
<i>And there by the river</i>

17:59.866 --> 18:02.517
<i>We'll find
the trail of dreams</i>

18:02.586 --> 18:06.711
<i>Donkey,
don't you dare to dally</i>

18:07.579 --> 18:12.217
<i>Can't you hear
the kill deer song?</i>

18:12.509 --> 18:15.030
Say, Hi. When did Honey
Bragg get into town?

18:15.102 --> 18:16.444
Well, it looks like
he just rode in

18:16.510 --> 18:18.615
the way
his horse is lathered.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.759
Must've done
a little riding yourself.

18:20.830 --> 18:22.172
All the way from Portland.

18:22.238 --> 18:24.028
Don't tell anyone.
Huh?

18:24.415 --> 18:25.942
What was that song
you were singing, Hi?

18:26.016 --> 18:27.904
Oh, I don't know.
Just a little song.

18:27.968 --> 18:29.878
It sounded very romantic.

18:29.953 --> 18:31.927
Well, Mandy
gets that way sometimes.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.561
Silly, isn't she?

18:34.081 --> 18:36.503
<i>She'll be by the river</i>

18:36.577 --> 18:38.814
<i>Where all heaven beams</i>

18:38.882 --> 18:41.337
<i>And there by the river</i>

18:41.410 --> 18:44.280
<i>We'll find
the trail of dreams</i>

18:44.355 --> 18:46.178
<i>Donkey, don't you dare...</i>

18:46.243 --> 18:47.902
Steady! Whoa! Whoa!

18:52.901 --> 18:54.495
Dad!
Lucy!

18:55.878 --> 18:57.951
Lucy! Hello, Logan.

18:58.022 --> 18:59.429
Mommy.
Nice trip, Logan?

18:59.494 --> 19:01.502
Did you enjoy yourself? Did
you have a nice time, dear?

19:01.575 --> 19:02.949
Yes, it was fun.

19:03.015 --> 19:06.660
Oh, we stopped by the Dances
and Mrs. Dance sends her hellos.

19:06.888 --> 19:08.415
There she is, George,
there's your girl.

19:08.488 --> 19:09.830
Thank you, Logan.

19:09.896 --> 19:11.937
Did he behave himself, Lucy?

19:12.010 --> 19:13.701
Oh, you're lovely.
I'd almost forgotten.

19:13.770 --> 19:15.778
Not entirely
I hope, George.

19:16.650 --> 19:18.373
Is that the best
you can do, George?

19:18.441 --> 19:19.554
Could you do any better?

19:19.626 --> 19:23.271
If I hadn't seen my girl for a
whole month, a whole lot better.

19:25.675 --> 19:28.097
Same old roughneck.
No polish at all.

19:31.949 --> 19:33.640
Did you mind my asking Logan
to bring you home?

19:33.709 --> 19:35.302
What took you over
to Crescent City, George?

19:35.373 --> 19:38.757
A mining claim. Looked like
a real strike, but it wasn't.

19:39.278 --> 19:40.806
Another rainbow?

19:41.070 --> 19:42.445
One day, I'll bring you
the pot of gold

19:42.511 --> 19:45.130
from the end of that rainbow,
you'll see.

19:45.263 --> 19:46.693
Are you glad
to be back, Lucy?

19:46.768 --> 19:48.940
How was the trip?
Wonderful.

20:06.132 --> 20:08.521
Good night.
Good night.

20:09.652 --> 20:12.141
Where's Morrow?
He'll be back Tuesday.

20:12.405 --> 20:14.412
I sent 40 mules
on the trip.

20:14.741 --> 20:17.524
Vane Blazier will take the
Scottsburg string in the morning,

20:17.590 --> 20:18.801
20 mules.

20:19.830 --> 20:21.773
Put this on the books, Clench.

20:21.847 --> 20:24.434
Thirty mules to be at Salem
on the 20th.

20:24.568 --> 20:26.391
Henry McLane's freight.

20:26.968 --> 20:28.561
Where will you get the mules?

20:28.632 --> 20:30.673
You're spread
pretty thin already.

20:30.746 --> 20:33.364
Maybe it's time for us
to buy a few more.

20:33.818 --> 20:37.397
Buy, buy.
Always buy, buy.

20:44.189 --> 20:45.531
Hello, Vane.

20:46.589 --> 20:48.792
Did you stop by at Dances?
Yes.

20:49.981 --> 20:52.502
How is everybody?
Caroline, you mean?

20:52.989 --> 20:54.298
She's fine.

20:56.798 --> 21:00.148
Do you realize you've got close
on $50,000 sunk in this place?

21:00.223 --> 21:01.237
We must be rich.

21:01.311 --> 21:04.127
You ought to have $10,000
laid by for trouble.

21:04.448 --> 21:07.383
What trouble? The
trouble that always comes.

21:07.456 --> 21:10.654
Why do you suppose I came here,
6,000 miles from Liverpool?

21:10.721 --> 21:13.536
This is Jacksonville, Clench,
U.S.A. We sail with the tide.

21:13.601 --> 21:15.293
All Americans think that.

21:15.363 --> 21:17.502
They think the tide
flows forever for them.

21:17.571 --> 21:18.880
But mark me, Logan.

21:18.947 --> 21:23.204
Gold veins run out, crops
fail, men starve, wars come.

21:23.268 --> 21:26.268
And businesses fail. Then we
get a new deck and deal again.

21:26.340 --> 21:28.348
So you'll buy the mules?

21:32.199 --> 21:35.046
What happened to you, Logan?
We waited supper for you.

21:35.110 --> 21:37.215
I thought you and George
would want to be together.

21:37.286 --> 21:39.970
Why, Logan, that's
a very tender sentiment.

21:40.039 --> 21:42.854
George, when is this girl
going to marry you?

21:43.367 --> 21:45.375
I doubt
if she knows herself, Logan.

21:45.448 --> 21:47.488
When are you taking me,
Lucy?

21:47.720 --> 21:49.062
George, do you like poetry?

21:49.128 --> 21:51.038
Must I like poetry
to be your husband?

21:51.113 --> 21:53.699
We will be married
when the leaves fall.

21:53.898 --> 21:57.030
You see, Logan. She strings
me up and lets me swing.

21:57.163 --> 21:58.757
You mean the maple leaves
that fall early,

21:58.828 --> 22:00.901
or the pine needles
that never fall at all?

22:00.971 --> 22:02.794
Come on, there's a fight. Fight? Who is it?

22:02.860 --> 22:04.006
I don't know.
What's going on?

22:04.077 --> 22:05.189
There's a fight at the back
of the settlement.

22:05.260 --> 22:06.406
Come on!

22:07.373 --> 22:08.802
You better
get up there, Logan.

22:08.878 --> 22:11.464
It's your friend
Vane Blazer and Bragg.

22:13.967 --> 22:15.494
Come on, George.

22:20.335 --> 22:22.158
Don't never crowd me, boy.

22:22.224 --> 22:23.751
Nobody crowded you.

22:23.856 --> 22:25.678
Oh, you're calling me
a liar.

22:25.744 --> 22:28.844
Stand up to him, Blazier.
Yeah. Let him have it.

22:28.913 --> 22:30.058
I didn't call you a liar.

22:30.129 --> 22:32.017
I'll bust you up
proper, boy.

22:35.986 --> 22:37.842
Having a little trouble, Vane?

22:39.156 --> 22:40.400
Hello, Bragg.

22:41.012 --> 22:42.987
Logan, my friend,
how are you?

22:43.060 --> 22:44.948
I hear you've been away.

22:45.076 --> 22:48.590
I'm here and there,
I'm a restless man.

22:48.917 --> 22:51.056
I've been away, too.
You have?

22:51.991 --> 22:54.773
Well, you're a restless man
like me.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.313
I notice
you're favoring your left leg.

23:00.633 --> 23:02.193
A horse threw me.

23:02.297 --> 23:05.613
It couldn't be you fell
through a window by any chance?

23:05.912 --> 23:08.018
Oh, let's get on
with the fight.

23:12.986 --> 23:15.321
See you sometime, Logan.

23:27.614 --> 23:30.298
Well, by gum,
it was a freeze out.

23:33.407 --> 23:35.546
Come on, Vane,
buy you a drink.

23:35.711 --> 23:38.232
Never mind.
I can fight my own battles.

23:43.265 --> 23:44.989
That was quite a surprise.

23:45.058 --> 23:47.098
More of a disappointment
to the boys, I'd say.

23:47.170 --> 23:49.560
What can you expect from
people living in the wilderness?

23:49.634 --> 23:51.064
What's wilderness
got to do with it?

23:51.139 --> 23:53.626
Everything, I think.
What do you say, Lucy?

23:53.699 --> 23:56.733
Some men are more primitive
than others, I guess.

23:56.899 --> 23:59.004
Some men
just fight it harder.

23:59.971 --> 24:02.689
Put his weight on Honey Bragg
and he broke.

24:05.541 --> 24:06.850
I'd say bent.

24:06.982 --> 24:09.316
Well, broke or bent,
what do you make of it, Hi?

24:09.382 --> 24:12.164
You're a lawyer, Jonas,
you figure it out.

24:15.143 --> 24:16.899
I'm glad
you enjoyed the trip, Lucy,

24:16.967 --> 24:19.172
but it's great
to have you back.

24:19.336 --> 24:21.540
I missed you.
Thank you, George.

24:22.312 --> 24:23.873
Well, see you tomorrow.

24:26.826 --> 24:30.656
You ought to do your kissing in
private, George, and do it better.

24:31.595 --> 24:34.563
I'll ask you again, Logan.
Could you do better?

24:49.870 --> 24:52.205
You brought it
on yourself, George.

24:53.711 --> 24:55.751
Good night.
Good night, Lucy.

25:00.785 --> 25:02.159
Going to play a little poker?

25:02.225 --> 25:03.655
I got to get some sleep,

25:03.729 --> 25:04.712
Oh, it's still early.

25:04.786 --> 25:07.688
I'm off on a trip tomorrow. I'm
going to look for some mules.

25:07.762 --> 25:09.323
Another trip so soon?

25:09.395 --> 25:10.802
If you're not careful,
one of these days

25:10.867 --> 25:13.170
you're going to end up
being a tired millionaire.

25:13.236 --> 25:14.992
Then I'll take it easy.

25:15.060 --> 25:17.482
See you when you get back.
Good luck.

25:19.541 --> 25:23.818
<i>I'm riding on a silver saddle</i>

25:25.365 --> 25:29.556
<i>The moon is my silver saddle</i>

25:31.063 --> 25:33.103
<i>And long before
the stars skedaddle</i>

25:36.728 --> 25:40.209
<i>I'll be with my love tonight</i>

25:42.265 --> 25:44.982
<i>She'll be in the gloaming</i>

25:45.241 --> 25:46.736
<i>Where all heaven beams</i>

25:46.810 --> 25:48.087
Oh, hello, Johnny.
Hi, Camrose.

25:48.155 --> 25:50.905
Ah, say, I know it's after hours,
but I saw a light in your office.

25:50.971 --> 25:52.826
Mind letting me have my dust?
Got some poker to play.

25:52.891 --> 25:54.747
Sure, Johnny, but I'll have
to ask you to wait outside

25:54.812 --> 25:56.274
while I open the safe.
Company rules.

25:56.349 --> 25:57.756
Sure, I know.

25:59.613 --> 26:03.389
<i>The moon is my silver saddle</i>

26:05.566 --> 26:09.178
<i>And long before
the stars skedaddle</i>

26:10.878 --> 26:14.676
<i>I'll be with my love tonight</i>

26:16.576 --> 26:21.279
<i>Me and my old Daisy,
up there in the sky</i>

26:21.953 --> 26:26.776
<i>And my heart beating crazy,
but it's no wonder why</i>

26:27.619 --> 26:31.231
<i>I'm riding on a silver saddle</i>

26:33.155 --> 26:37.182
<i>To someone
who loves me right</i>

26:38.756 --> 26:43.230
<i>The moon is my silver saddle</i>

26:44.390 --> 26:49.181
<i>I'm riding the moon tonight</i>

26:50.408 --> 26:51.902
Hello, Johnny.

26:52.104 --> 26:53.249
How were things
up the Applegate?

26:53.320 --> 26:54.597
Oh, terrible.

26:54.664 --> 26:56.453
All I got for my trouble
was this watch.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.600
Oh, I see.

26:57.672 --> 27:00.771
Yeah, the dandiest thing. I found
it hidden in an old Indian skull.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.230
I'll trade you
a good fiddle for it.

27:03.658 --> 27:04.868
What would I want
with a fiddle?

27:04.937 --> 27:07.426
Well, all you can do with that
is clock the time.

27:07.499 --> 27:09.888
With a fiddle
you can pass the time.

27:10.571 --> 27:11.881
All right,
I'll trade you for that.

27:11.948 --> 27:15.080
Oh no, not my Mandy.
Mmm-mmm, no.

27:17.228 --> 27:19.880
Say, how long does it take
to open a safe?

27:28.303 --> 27:29.830
Come in, Johnny.

27:38.801 --> 27:40.589
There you are, Johnny.

27:43.762 --> 27:45.518
Much obliged, Camrose.
Glad to do it.

27:45.586 --> 27:47.529
Good luck with your poker.

28:02.742 --> 28:03.855
Heads.

28:28.570 --> 28:30.000
Hello, Linnet.

28:30.747 --> 28:31.729
Hello.

28:31.804 --> 28:34.390
Coming up to Lestrade's?
Oh, maybe later.

28:35.581 --> 28:37.621
Uh, you feeling
lucky tonight?

28:37.693 --> 28:40.214
I always feel lucky.
That's my trouble.

28:40.734 --> 28:42.141
I'll see you.

28:45.599 --> 28:47.640
King high straight.

28:47.775 --> 28:48.953
Ace high.

28:49.024 --> 28:51.479
It's too good for me.
And me.

28:51.552 --> 28:54.488
That cleans me.
Of all the rotten luck.

28:54.593 --> 28:56.699
You're a
cleaned chicken, huh?

28:58.337 --> 29:00.345
I'll have to give you
my IOU, Jack.

29:00.418 --> 29:01.498
With pleasure.

29:01.571 --> 29:03.906
Marta, pen and ink
for Mr. Camrose.

29:05.508 --> 29:08.443
Too bad your friend Logan
couldn't be with us tonight.

29:08.516 --> 29:10.938
Oh, he's off
on another trip tomorrow.

29:11.013 --> 29:12.605
Always on the move.

29:12.676 --> 29:14.564
I wish I had his energy.

29:15.076 --> 29:17.466
He came near using some
of it tonight on Bragg.

29:17.541 --> 29:18.621
And Bragg backed down.

29:18.694 --> 29:20.320
What did Logan
want to butt in for?

29:20.390 --> 29:23.587
Well, maybe he didn't want to
see that young fellow butchered.

29:23.655 --> 29:27.169
All you boys wanted to see was
a fight. Ever consider that?

29:27.496 --> 29:30.279
Better tell Logan
to walk softly with Bragg.

29:30.344 --> 29:32.286
Tell Bragg to walk softly.

29:34.857 --> 29:37.345
Bragg is nothing
but a low-down skunk.

29:37.865 --> 29:39.240
Oh, come, Dr. Balance.

29:39.306 --> 29:41.762
Honey Bragg's
a sort of friend of mine.

29:41.835 --> 29:43.974
You have
strange friends, Jack.

29:44.235 --> 29:47.531
Well, I didn't say that I
like him or that I trust him.

29:47.660 --> 29:49.701
What's your idea
of a friend?

29:49.804 --> 29:52.226
Any man, I suppose,
who believes as I do

29:52.301 --> 29:54.571
that the human race
is a horrible mistake.

29:58.541 --> 30:00.549
Always damp. Always cold.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.753
Isn't there any heat
anywhere in the world?

30:03.823 --> 30:05.100
Good night.

30:06.927 --> 30:08.967
Coming my way, Howison?
Mmm.

30:09.039 --> 30:10.633
Good night, Marta.

30:12.272 --> 30:13.734
Coming, George?

30:25.875 --> 30:28.178
I hear there's going to be
a cabin-raising next week.

30:28.244 --> 30:29.192
Whose?

30:29.268 --> 30:32.204
Some young couple who apparently
disagree with your husband's theories

30:32.277 --> 30:35.661
about perpetuating the human
race. You'll come, won't you?

30:37.014 --> 30:39.382
Why do you play so high when
the cards are going against you?

30:39.447 --> 30:41.040
Oh, I'll get it back.

30:41.111 --> 30:42.966
Five or six good hands
in a night.

30:43.032 --> 30:44.820
Jack can't always be
that lucky.

30:44.887 --> 30:46.316
You're a fool.

30:46.647 --> 30:49.517
Censure on your lips,
solicitude in your eyes.

30:49.592 --> 30:51.632
Is that really for me,
Marta?

30:51.833 --> 30:55.063
You're always reading things
in the way I look at you.

30:55.129 --> 30:57.169
The things I'd like to read.

30:57.498 --> 30:59.441
They're not there, George.

30:59.515 --> 31:00.824
How's Lucy?

31:02.619 --> 31:03.829
Adorable.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.148
Good night, Marta.
Good night.

31:20.319 --> 31:21.367
Hurry up!

31:21.439 --> 31:23.545
There it goes!
There it goes!

31:29.825 --> 31:31.712
There, I think
that's wide enough.

31:31.776 --> 31:34.460
That's big enough
for anybody's fireplace.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.183
Here's your other door.

31:37.570 --> 31:39.709
You can get out either side
in case you have trouble

31:39.779 --> 31:41.884
with the Indians
or your woman.

31:41.955 --> 31:44.225
Oh, Mrs. Dance,
I just can't get over it.

31:44.292 --> 31:46.234
All these people
coming from miles around,

31:46.308 --> 31:49.058
people we don't even know
giving their time and all

31:49.125 --> 31:51.100
to build a house
for Gray and me.

31:51.173 --> 31:53.377
Yes, but don't forget it
means a lot to them, too.

31:53.446 --> 31:56.414
For sure. A neighbor,
a new family starting up.

31:57.031 --> 32:00.479
And another pair of hands to
stand off those red beasters.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.277
Hold up!

32:17.898 --> 32:20.899
If you want to catch a man,
you've got to work at it.

32:20.971 --> 32:22.979
I want no man
I have to catch.

32:23.052 --> 32:26.401
Why, sure. You catch him
and he catches you.

32:26.476 --> 32:28.419
A man always figures
that he does the catching.

32:28.493 --> 32:30.882
The truth is, it's the woman
that brings him up on the rope,

32:30.957 --> 32:32.648
him not quite knowing it.

32:32.717 --> 32:34.092
Is that the way
you got Mrs. Dance?

32:34.158 --> 32:35.914
Sure.
But she gave me the sign.

32:35.982 --> 32:38.219
You've gotta give a man
the sign.

32:38.735 --> 32:40.262
Maybe that's so.

32:42.384 --> 32:43.594
Whoa, boy.

32:50.161 --> 32:52.300
Let's stroll down
by the river.

32:53.394 --> 32:55.304
I thought we came here
to help, George.

32:55.379 --> 32:58.161
Doesn't this scene
of domesticity inspire you?

32:58.228 --> 33:00.562
Not to sweat
over a hammer and saw.

33:00.692 --> 33:05.067
But it does inspire me to stretch out
in the shade with my head on your lap.

33:45.949 --> 33:49.080
This will be a handy place
for your woodpile, Liza.

34:26.149 --> 34:28.036
Oh, it's so peaceful here.

34:28.101 --> 34:30.655
Mmm. The illusion
of peace is upon it.

34:32.103 --> 34:33.924
You sound rather jaded.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.226
Oh, these cabin-raisings
jade me.

34:36.998 --> 34:41.222
People planting themselves in one
rough spot for the rest of their lives.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.931
I'm more for mansions
and plush furniture.

34:45.001 --> 34:46.342
What I wouldn't give
right now

34:46.409 --> 34:49.312
to be in an expensive
restaurant in Boston or New York.

34:49.386 --> 34:50.847
Mmm, with music playing.

34:50.922 --> 34:54.567
And you in a maroon waistcoat
and me in an elegant green gown.

34:54.795 --> 34:58.570
Ah, Lucy, there's so much of
this world that we're missing.

34:59.980 --> 35:02.795
Perhaps, George, if you took
things a bit more seriously.

35:02.860 --> 35:05.250
You mean like Logan?
Always figuring.

35:05.486 --> 35:07.428
More stores,
more mules...

35:07.502 --> 35:10.350
What I mean is, if you
didn't gamble so much.

35:10.735 --> 35:13.638
This is a gambling country.
Everybody gambles.

35:13.711 --> 35:15.086
Even Logan gambles,
doesn't he,

35:15.151 --> 35:16.777
every time he sends out
a pack train?

35:16.848 --> 35:17.863
That's different.

35:17.936 --> 35:19.180
Well, we're different.

35:19.248 --> 35:23.045
He's not responsible for his
character and neither am I for mine.

35:23.761 --> 35:26.827
You know, I feel that sometimes
you make a comparison between us

35:26.897 --> 35:28.686
that leaves me
at a disadvantage.

35:28.754 --> 35:29.998
George,
don't complicate things.

35:30.066 --> 35:32.008
Let's keep them simple
and straight.

35:32.082 --> 35:35.116
Mmm, my thoughts rarely
travel in a straight line.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.609
How about your affections?

35:37.972 --> 35:42.545
My affections, always,
where you're concerned Lucy.

35:42.613 --> 35:44.468
Oh, George.

35:45.846 --> 35:48.367
God bless the hands
that built it,

35:48.438 --> 35:50.610
and the two
that it was built for,

35:50.678 --> 35:55.152
and may they prosper and live in
peace all the days of their lives.

36:09.178 --> 36:13.172
Those whom God has joined
together, let no man put asunder.

36:13.403 --> 36:15.640
For as much as
Gray and Liza here

36:15.707 --> 36:18.261
have consented together
in holy wedlock,

36:18.492 --> 36:21.809
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company

36:22.013 --> 36:25.810
and thereto have given and pledged
their troth each to the other,

36:26.334 --> 36:28.822
I pronounce
that they are man and wife.

36:29.054 --> 36:33.463
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

36:33.535 --> 36:34.779
Amen.

36:34.847 --> 36:37.084
Now kiss her, son,
and let's eat.

36:45.058 --> 36:46.913
Where were you, Hi?
What kept you?

36:46.978 --> 36:47.960
Well, the work all done?

36:48.034 --> 36:49.595
Yeah, you timed it
just right, Hi.

36:49.667 --> 36:50.976
Cabin's all raised.

36:51.043 --> 36:53.694
The couple's spliced and ready to
raise a cabin full of young'uns.

36:53.763 --> 36:55.803
Well, I couldn't find Mandy.

37:06.438 --> 37:07.932
Soy bean.

37:11.559 --> 37:12.966
Soy bean.

37:14.407 --> 37:16.775
It's nice to have
a place of your own

37:16.840 --> 37:19.361
and know your children'll
grow up there.

37:19.753 --> 37:22.983
If they're boys, I'd want
them to take up land nearby.

37:23.657 --> 37:25.513
If they're girls, I'd want
them to marry neighbors

37:25.578 --> 37:27.139
and not move off.

37:28.683 --> 37:30.472
When I'm dead, I'd like
them to stand where I stood

37:30.539 --> 37:32.427
and see the things I saw.

37:32.492 --> 37:36.071
Yes, but the man you get might
not want to stay in one place.

37:36.972 --> 37:39.361
Would it make you unhappy
to move away?

37:39.436 --> 37:41.804
It would be hard to be
always fixing a new cabin

37:41.869 --> 37:43.844
and starting a new garden.

37:47.022 --> 37:48.932
Do you like Jacksonville,
Logan?

37:49.007 --> 37:51.146
It's a place
to do business in.

37:51.663 --> 37:54.598
Folks say you make money,
but you're always risking it.

37:54.672 --> 37:56.745
I never pay much attention
to money.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.337
And you're restless,
everybody says so.

38:00.465 --> 38:02.058
Yes, I guess I am.

38:04.946 --> 38:08.525
It's easy to be that way if
you've nothing to keep you home.

38:12.532 --> 38:15.696
How about it, folks? Up on
your feet. Grab a partner.

38:17.013 --> 38:20.363
<i>Sing it way up high
like a robin in the sky</i>

38:20.502 --> 38:23.764
<i>And tell them I'm getting
married in the morning</i>

38:23.926 --> 38:27.603
<i>Put all your cares aside, come
and kiss the blushing bride</i>

38:27.671 --> 38:30.967
<i>'Cause honey, I'm getting
married in the morning</i>

38:31.223 --> 38:34.453
<i>You ought to see
who promised to be mine</i>

38:35.128 --> 38:36.819
Here you are,
whiskey or water!

38:36.888 --> 38:38.481
You can't dance
without sweating!

38:38.552 --> 38:40.375
<i>Lift up your hearts and shout</i>

38:40.441 --> 38:42.646
<i>So that the news
will get about</i>

38:42.714 --> 38:45.682
<i>'Cause, honey, I'm getting
married in the morning</i>

38:45.755 --> 38:47.031
That's it now!

39:01.054 --> 39:04.371
<i>Sing it way up high
like a robin in the sky</i>

39:04.447 --> 39:07.611
<i>And tell them I'm getting
married in the morning</i>

39:07.711 --> 39:09.401
<i>We'll pass
the little brown jug</i>

39:09.471 --> 39:11.260
<i>But bring a fiddle
and a mug</i>

39:11.327 --> 39:14.590
<i>'Cause, honey, I'm getting
married in the morning</i>

39:14.656 --> 39:17.559
<i>Why you can hitch old Dobbin
to the shay</i>

39:17.985 --> 39:21.531
<i>And bring the family out
for a lovely day, hey!</i>

39:21.602 --> 39:25.280
<i>Lift up your hearts and sing
when the church bells start...</i>

39:41.830 --> 39:43.205
What you want?

39:58.537 --> 39:59.617
It's the same old story.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.665
They don't mind us
coming here.

40:01.737 --> 40:04.455
It's like he says,
mother earth is for all.

40:04.586 --> 40:08.035
What they don't like is the
cabin. That makes the land ours.

40:08.107 --> 40:10.311
We got to live, too.
That's right.

40:57.366 --> 40:58.893
Where's my boys?

40:59.414 --> 41:01.269
We've been watching them,
they got no guns.

41:01.334 --> 41:03.440
Yeah, they got no guns.
Good boys.

41:03.511 --> 41:05.169
Now you stay by me.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.255
Better hit it up, boys.

41:20.699 --> 41:22.838
What are you thinking, Logan?

41:22.971 --> 41:26.965
Oh, I was just thinking of what you
said awhile ago, the years ahead.

41:28.604 --> 41:31.801
Caroline, do you like me well
enough to make a marriage of it?

41:31.900 --> 41:33.461
Yes, Logan, I do.

41:38.461 --> 41:41.309
Caroline, it's time
to pick up and go.

41:45.183 --> 41:47.071
You're a good man, Logan.

41:47.136 --> 41:49.144
And you've got a good girl.

41:51.041 --> 41:52.929
Logan! Why that's great.

41:59.523 --> 42:01.760
I know
you'll be happy, Caroline.

42:02.852 --> 42:04.379
Thank you, Lucy.

42:06.020 --> 42:09.501
You see, there's nothing to
it when you give him the sign.

42:16.966 --> 42:18.177
Soy bean.

42:22.535 --> 42:23.996
Soy bean.

43:01.390 --> 43:04.042
Morning, Mr. Logan.
You're up early.

43:06.416 --> 43:08.107
What's on your mind?

43:08.817 --> 43:10.410
Let's have a drink.

43:10.481 --> 43:11.943
It's too early.

43:18.899 --> 43:20.809
I'm thirsty early or not.

43:21.203 --> 43:23.308
Lots of places up the street.

43:26.580 --> 43:28.468
Well, a drink's a drink.

43:44.567 --> 43:46.543
I want you and Morrow to pull
out for Salem this afternoon.

43:46.616 --> 43:47.794
McLane's freight.

43:47.864 --> 43:49.687
Thirty mules.
All right.

43:50.937 --> 43:53.326
What's hit you, Vane?
Let's have it.

43:55.194 --> 43:56.689
All right, I'll tell you.

43:56.762 --> 43:59.894
She don't like big towns.
She don't like big ideas.

44:00.923 --> 44:03.411
She don't like
moving around and changing.

44:03.484 --> 44:05.077
It's her choice.

44:05.180 --> 44:07.188
You're not the man for her.

44:09.021 --> 44:11.836
I'm sorry the way it
turned out for you, Vane.

44:12.542 --> 44:14.485
I didn't mean to bust out.

44:15.871 --> 44:17.595
Let's load the boxes.

44:22.624 --> 44:24.381
Bragg's up at Stutchell's.

44:24.449 --> 44:26.783
They're all expecting you
up there.

44:27.937 --> 44:29.661
You might as well go.

44:29.921 --> 44:32.343
The town won't have it
any other way.

44:32.706 --> 44:34.081
How about it, Logan?

44:34.146 --> 44:36.251
You got a bet on this,
Johnny?

44:36.482 --> 44:38.239
Yeah, a small one.

44:38.307 --> 44:39.714
Which way?

44:40.388 --> 44:42.046
Which do you think?

44:45.412 --> 44:46.842
He'll get your eyes
if he can.

44:46.916 --> 44:48.772
Kill him
and be done with it.

44:48.837 --> 44:50.364
You too, Clench?

44:53.510 --> 44:55.485
Come on,
it's gonna be a slaughter.

44:55.558 --> 44:56.988
He can't whip Bragg.
Nobody can.

44:57.063 --> 44:58.471
How much have you got
that says so?

44:58.535 --> 45:00.445
I've got a hundred.
Well, put it up.

45:00.520 --> 45:02.593
You want a hunk of this,
Linnet?

45:02.665 --> 45:04.126
No, I'm not betting.

45:04.200 --> 45:05.477
Did you ever see
Bragg's arms?

45:05.545 --> 45:07.913
I seen him bust a
two-by-four over his knee.

45:07.978 --> 45:10.051
I seen him break four
of Jed Peters' ribs.

45:10.122 --> 45:11.911
He ain't got a chance.

45:31.181 --> 45:33.571
Give me a bottle, Harry,
a full one.

45:41.232 --> 45:42.891
I left my gun home.

45:43.120 --> 45:44.844
I brought mine along.

45:49.682 --> 45:51.886
Let's make this
a fair fight, Logan.

45:51.954 --> 45:53.897
I've got nothing
against you.

45:53.971 --> 45:55.663
It's the boys
that want the fun.

45:55.732 --> 45:57.423
You're lying, Bragg.

45:57.684 --> 45:59.277
What have you got against me?

45:59.348 --> 46:00.875
You ought to know.

46:00.948 --> 46:03.795
You're talking in riddles,
Logan. What's on your mind?

46:03.860 --> 46:06.730
A picture of a tree,
with you swinging from it.

46:06.805 --> 46:08.529
You hear that, Stutchell?

46:08.597 --> 46:10.256
Yeah. Yeah, I hear.

46:10.966 --> 46:12.876
What's the matter, Harry?

46:17.495 --> 46:20.081
Now you've got him.
Beat his brains out.

46:22.553 --> 46:25.619
That's all right, Logan.
I'll get you in a minute.

46:30.842 --> 46:33.713
That's all right, Logan.
I'll break your back.

46:34.300 --> 46:35.794
Now, we can close in, Bragg.

46:35.868 --> 46:37.297
You think I won't?

46:53.470 --> 46:55.031
Now I've got you!

47:11.715 --> 47:14.104
Over here, Bragg.
Over here.

47:14.980 --> 47:16.922
Time to put out the light!

47:37.672 --> 47:38.720
Dogs.

47:39.624 --> 47:40.966
Yellow dogs.

47:54.059 --> 47:55.620
You surprised me.

47:59.597 --> 48:01.702
Oh, that was great, Logan!
Great!

48:01.773 --> 48:04.196
Now you can
collect your bet, Johnny.

48:04.974 --> 48:06.796
He'll be after you
the rest of your life.

48:06.862 --> 48:08.073
Why didn't you kill him?

48:08.143 --> 48:10.216
Would that have been
more fun, Lucy?

48:10.287 --> 48:12.556
That's what you all came
for, isn't it? Excitement?

48:12.624 --> 48:15.046
If that's the way you feel,
you didn't have to fight him.

48:15.121 --> 48:16.615
Sure,
I could have backed down

48:16.689 --> 48:19.144
and turned the whole town
over to Bragg.

48:19.216 --> 48:21.802
But all it meant
to any of you is a show.

48:32.019 --> 48:33.546
Logan! Look out!

48:38.996 --> 48:41.964
You should take my advice and
put some raw meat on those eyes.

48:42.037 --> 48:44.624
They'll be all right.
It's just bruises.

48:45.526 --> 48:47.250
Nothing I can do for you?

48:47.318 --> 48:48.496
Yes, one thing.

48:48.567 --> 48:50.575
Quit playing poker, George.

48:51.544 --> 48:53.748
Quit poker? What for?

48:54.808 --> 48:57.842
You can't afford it
if you have to give out IOUs.

48:58.681 --> 49:01.235
Poker's the only relaxation
I get around here.

49:01.306 --> 49:04.089
Mighty expensive relaxation
at $500 a throw.

49:06.490 --> 49:08.879
George, what's got
into you, lately?

49:10.523 --> 49:12.628
Oh, I don't know.
It's just...

49:12.732 --> 49:15.034
I'm sick
of this godforsaken hole.

49:15.163 --> 49:17.750
It's all right for you, you're
rich. You've got your own business.

49:17.821 --> 49:19.447
You're not gonna get rich
at Lestrade's.

49:19.517 --> 49:21.851
You'll end up
owing him your shirt.

49:23.197 --> 49:25.402
He's practically
got it already.

49:25.630 --> 49:27.638
George, are you in trouble?

49:27.743 --> 49:29.434
How much do you owe?

49:30.399 --> 49:33.880
Oh, at one place and another,
a couple of thousand, maybe.

49:44.419 --> 49:46.427
Let me have $2,000, Clench.

49:47.363 --> 49:49.054
$2,000? What for?

49:49.860 --> 49:51.747
Grubstake.
Grubstake.

49:52.996 --> 49:55.003
So that's what you call it.

50:07.622 --> 50:09.565
What's this?
Pay them off.

50:10.055 --> 50:12.773
Just give me your word
you'll quit, George.

50:13.768 --> 50:16.551
Well, if you insist, but
it'll be a mighty dull world.

50:16.616 --> 50:19.519
Sure, but a man whose business is
handling other people's money...

50:19.594 --> 50:22.726
Must be above suspicion.
Yes, I guess you're right.

50:24.362 --> 50:26.185
But I wish
I didn't have to take this.

50:26.251 --> 50:27.528
Don't feel that way
about it.

50:27.595 --> 50:29.635
That's what friends are for.

50:29.803 --> 50:30.851
Sure.

50:40.141 --> 50:44.136
<i>And long before
the stars skedaddle</i>

50:45.678 --> 50:49.541
<i>I'll be with my love tonight</i>

50:51.343 --> 50:54.192
<i>She'll be in the gloaming</i>

50:54.257 --> 50:56.559
<i>Where all heaven beams</i>

50:56.881 --> 50:59.565
<i>And out there in the gloaming</i>

50:59.633 --> 51:02.187
<i>We'll find the trail of dreams</i>

51:02.514 --> 51:06.923
<i>I'm riding on a silver saddle</i>

51:08.404 --> 51:12.682
<i>The moon is my silver saddle</i>

51:14.261 --> 51:18.485
<i>And long before
the stars skedaddle</i>

51:19.862 --> 51:24.369
<i>I'll be with my love tonight</i>

51:25.623 --> 51:28.209
<i>Me and my old Daisy</i>

51:28.407 --> 51:30.797
<i>Up there in the sky</i>

51:30.903 --> 51:33.653
<i>And my heart beating crazy</i>

51:33.848 --> 51:36.566
<i>But it's no wonder why</i>

51:45.787 --> 51:46.900
Heads.

52:12.897 --> 52:15.767
I wish I was 10,000 miles
from this place.

52:16.353 --> 52:17.847
It wouldn't make
any difference, George.

52:17.921 --> 52:20.311
You'd be the same
wherever you were.

52:21.410 --> 52:22.621
Wouldn't you miss me, Marta?

52:22.691 --> 52:25.212
Why should I?
You've got Lucy.

52:25.443 --> 52:26.490
Have I?

52:26.563 --> 52:28.451
If you haven't,
it's your own fault.

52:28.515 --> 52:29.726
Of course.

52:29.796 --> 52:31.203
But a woman
is supposed to love a man

52:31.268 --> 52:33.178
because of his faults,
isn't she?

52:33.253 --> 52:34.431
Some women.

52:34.501 --> 52:35.811
But not you?

52:37.446 --> 52:39.486
Oh, Marta, don't be so hard.

52:39.719 --> 52:41.093
Why can't we be friends?

52:41.158 --> 52:42.173
Why?

52:42.695 --> 52:45.184
Why can't you be a friend
to yourself?

53:18.126 --> 53:19.818
How are you, Camrose?

53:20.847 --> 53:23.214
Mclver,
what are you doing in town?

53:23.311 --> 53:24.773
I just blew In.

53:26.192 --> 53:27.916
I didn't expect you
for another month.

53:27.985 --> 53:29.359
Well, I didn't have
any luck.

53:29.425 --> 53:32.556
I just wore out shoe leather.
I'll buy you a drink.

53:33.042 --> 53:35.279
Thanks. Thanks, I can't.

53:52.213 --> 53:53.325
I'll see you tomorrow.

53:53.397 --> 53:55.918
I want to get my dust
out of your safe.

53:56.598 --> 53:58.322
Sure. Any time.

53:59.575 --> 54:03.667
<i>Happy all of their lives</i>

54:03.735 --> 54:05.262
Hello, Mack! How are you?

54:05.336 --> 54:07.890
Hello, Mclver.
How are you?

54:09.177 --> 54:12.025
<i>If you be happy</i>

54:12.537 --> 54:15.572
<i>Don't ever wed</i>

54:15.674 --> 54:19.832
<i>Just stay a free man</i>

54:19.899 --> 54:21.273
I gotta go home, fellows.

54:21.340 --> 54:23.063
Oh, no, Mack.
Come on.

54:23.131 --> 54:25.466
No, I gotta go home.
I gotta go home.

54:25.533 --> 54:26.939
Come on, Johnny.
Let him go.

54:27.004 --> 54:28.827
You don't know
what you're missing, Mclver.

54:28.892 --> 54:30.900
<i>Don't ever wed</i>

54:34.909 --> 54:37.463
<i>Till you are dead</i>

54:37.662 --> 54:40.663
<i>If you be happy</i>

54:40.735 --> 54:43.932
<i>Don't ever wed</i>

55:23.752 --> 55:26.982
Go away?
Leave Jacksonville? When?

55:27.368 --> 55:30.020
Tomorrow, the day after,
as soon as we can.

55:30.090 --> 55:31.748
But why this
sudden decision, George?

55:31.817 --> 55:35.201
Nothing sudden. It's just
that I'm fed up with this hole.

55:35.274 --> 55:36.420
It's a place
to strike it rich

55:36.491 --> 55:39.721
and if you don't, you should
try your luck someplace else.

55:39.788 --> 55:41.893
Luck doesn't depend
on a place.

55:41.964 --> 55:44.267
George, can't you
be content here?

55:44.396 --> 55:45.738
No, I can't.

55:46.605 --> 55:48.548
Let's go in. You're upset.

55:49.965 --> 55:53.796
Lucy, I'm going.
And you're going with me.

55:54.639 --> 55:55.916
You promised to marry me,
didn't you?

55:55.983 --> 55:57.576
Yes.
Well, when?

55:59.471 --> 56:00.518
Whenever you want.

56:00.591 --> 56:02.599
Sunday, this Sunday.
Oh, no.

56:03.024 --> 56:04.617
I'll have to make a dress.

56:04.688 --> 56:06.249
Is a dress a marriage?

56:06.321 --> 56:08.296
Lucy, when did you say?

56:08.625 --> 56:09.770
Sunday?

56:10.802 --> 56:12.689
As soon as
she can make a dress.

56:12.754 --> 56:14.663
Hello, Logan.
Hello, Lucy.

56:15.634 --> 56:17.609
Well, George, I'm off to
San Francisco in the morning,

56:17.683 --> 56:19.658
I stopped by to have a
word with you in private.

56:19.731 --> 56:20.779
Sure.

56:24.853 --> 56:26.380
What's the matter, dear?
Nothing.

56:26.453 --> 56:28.526
Is it true that you and George
are really getting married?

56:28.598 --> 56:30.769
Yes.
Oh, but why the haste?

56:30.838 --> 56:32.082
George wants to go away.

56:32.151 --> 56:33.712
But, dear...

56:33.782 --> 56:36.117
Where are you to find material
for a dress in this camp?

56:36.184 --> 56:38.835
Yes, and besides, I always said
that when my daughter got married,

56:38.904 --> 56:41.293
she'd have the finest
wedding in the territory.

56:41.368 --> 56:43.789
I'll even get the Governor
to come down.

56:43.864 --> 56:44.912
I'll tell you what.

56:44.985 --> 56:46.992
Why don't you go along
with Logan to San Francisco?

56:47.064 --> 56:48.690
No.
Oh, but why not, dear?

56:48.761 --> 56:51.762
There are any number
of French dressmakers there.

56:52.314 --> 56:54.454
I ought to
knock your head off.

56:54.971 --> 56:55.919
What's the matter?

56:55.995 --> 56:58.385
You gave me your word
you'd quit poker.

56:58.459 --> 57:00.053
Yes, Logan, I did.

57:00.380 --> 57:02.420
I had every intention
of keeping it.

57:02.492 --> 57:04.729
The devil tempted you,
I suppose.

57:04.956 --> 57:05.971
Yes.

57:06.525 --> 57:08.729
The devil with green eyes.
Envy.

57:08.926 --> 57:11.065
Envy of you, Logan.
That's no answer.

57:11.198 --> 57:13.206
Maybe it's the only answer.

57:13.567 --> 57:15.902
But don't worry,
I'll pay you back.

57:15.967 --> 57:17.396
I don't care
about the money, George.

57:17.472 --> 57:18.650
I do.

57:19.648 --> 57:22.966
I'm pulling out, going
someplace else and make a strike.

57:23.681 --> 57:26.464
Pulling out
and taking Lucy with you?

57:27.489 --> 57:29.083
Lucy's my concern.

57:29.507 --> 57:32.506
Not if you're going to make her
life a thing of running and hunting.

57:32.578 --> 57:34.553
Does she concern you
that much?

57:34.626 --> 57:36.056
Yes, she does.

57:36.419 --> 57:37.532
I see.

57:37.763 --> 57:39.105
Logan.

57:40.132 --> 57:41.823
About San Francisco,

57:42.020 --> 57:44.803
would you mind
having a woman on your hands?

57:47.717 --> 57:48.895
Why, no.

57:49.350 --> 57:51.139
I have to get a dress.

57:52.743 --> 57:54.980
You'll be
in good company, Lucy.

57:55.047 --> 57:56.803
I'm starting early,
I have to stop at Dance's.

57:56.872 --> 57:58.116
Aren't you staying for supper?

57:58.184 --> 58:00.421
I can't.
I have something to do.

58:07.370 --> 58:08.744
Why, hello, stranger.

58:08.810 --> 58:11.080
How much did you take off
Camrose last night?

58:11.147 --> 58:14.825
About 1,500 in gold,
another 1,500 in a note.

58:18.283 --> 58:19.745
I want it back.

58:20.620 --> 58:23.141
You have a streak in you
about Camrose.

58:23.277 --> 58:24.706
For me,
he's strictly a tinhorn.

58:24.781 --> 58:27.269
Tinhorn or not,
I want the money back.

58:28.110 --> 58:30.150
Look here, Logan,
my business is cards...

58:30.222 --> 58:32.011
You do too well at it.

58:32.207 --> 58:33.669
If that money's not
in Camrose's hands

58:33.743 --> 58:35.466
by the time I get back
from San Francisco,

58:35.535 --> 58:37.227
I'll come after you.

58:50.707 --> 58:52.398
Where are you going?

59:06.357 --> 59:07.535
Shut up!

59:08.726 --> 59:10.733
What do you want? I thought
it might interest you,

59:10.806 --> 59:13.425
Logan Stuart's
leaving for San Francisco.

59:13.912 --> 59:15.919
Well, come on in.

59:23.929 --> 59:25.937
Where are you bound for
this time, Logan?

59:26.010 --> 59:29.010
For San Francisco, to see
if I can borrow some money.

59:29.082 --> 59:30.511
Are you in trouble, Logan?

59:30.587 --> 59:31.667
The trouble is my business,

59:31.739 --> 59:34.522
like young Asa here,
always outgrowing his pants.

59:34.620 --> 59:36.922
You're a moving around man,
Logan.

59:37.372 --> 59:40.689
Well, the hound that rustles
always catches the rabbit.

59:40.894 --> 59:44.506
And there are hounds always lean
and hungry from running too much.

59:45.599 --> 59:47.322
Aimed at you, my boy.

59:49.054 --> 59:52.470
I'm sure Logan didn't stop by
here to see you wash dishes.

01:00:14.724 --> 01:00:17.790
Is she going to San Francisco
to borrow money, too?

01:00:17.925 --> 01:00:19.135
Jealous?

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:22.975
Should I be?
No.

01:00:25.671 --> 01:00:28.486
Logan, there's nothing
to delay us, is there?

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.502
Not a thing.

01:00:32.232 --> 01:00:33.824
When's it going to be?

01:00:33.895 --> 01:00:35.652
Just as soon as I get back.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.444
In a couple of weeks.

01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:06.252
What's that?

01:01:09.872 --> 01:01:10.919
Down.

01:02:41.411 --> 01:02:43.321
He had to kill something.

01:02:43.907 --> 01:02:46.941
We'd better hide the saddles
and get out of here.

01:03:00.006 --> 01:03:02.341
We'll have to make it
back on foot.

01:03:04.295 --> 01:03:06.783
Another hard time
for you to remember.

01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:18.851
That's what you wanted, wasn't it? Yes.

01:03:18.922 --> 01:03:20.329
Then don't look at me
like that.

01:03:20.394 --> 01:03:22.053
Lucy, this is no good.
You're lying.

01:03:22.123 --> 01:03:24.741
Logan, I want to get things straight
between us before it's too late.

01:03:24.811 --> 01:03:26.241
It's too late.

01:03:31.245 --> 01:03:34.213
Maybe we can borrow a
couple of horses at Elkton.

01:04:53.629 --> 01:04:57.885
Well, I'm sorry about
your wedding dress, Lucy.

01:04:57.951 --> 01:04:59.544
Any dress will do.

01:05:02.304 --> 01:05:03.548
What brought you back?

01:05:03.616 --> 01:05:05.045
I ran into
a little trouble, Clench.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.739
Mmm. The world is rocking
with trouble this morning.

01:05:07.809 --> 01:05:09.630
Your world in particular,
Logan.

01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:12.086
They've taken Camrose in
for murder.

01:05:12.993 --> 01:05:14.815
Murder?
Mack Mclver.

01:05:14.881 --> 01:05:16.573
They found him drowned
in the creek.

01:05:16.642 --> 01:05:18.552
Looked like an accident
at first.

01:05:18.626 --> 01:05:21.213
But Johnny Steele and Hi
Linnet got to working on it.

01:05:21.283 --> 01:05:22.712
Where is George?

01:05:22.787 --> 01:05:25.919
They're holding court on
him now up at Stutchell's.

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.232
And it grew on me that Camrose
was tampering with the dust

01:05:31.301 --> 01:05:33.189
the boys left
with the company.

01:05:33.253 --> 01:05:34.977
He was losing a lot of money
at poker...

01:05:35.046 --> 01:05:37.152
That's hearsay,
Johnny.

01:05:37.575 --> 01:05:39.364
What's wrong with hearsay
if it's true?

01:05:39.431 --> 01:05:40.576
Johnny,

01:05:41.255 --> 01:05:42.979
what have I got here?

01:05:44.008 --> 01:05:45.536
A silver dollar.

01:05:46.185 --> 01:05:47.778
Are you certain of it?

01:05:47.849 --> 01:05:49.257
Dead certain.

01:05:50.922 --> 01:05:53.159
Howison, what does it
look like to you?

01:05:53.226 --> 01:05:55.975
You're was time, Hi.
It's a plain old U.S. dollar.

01:05:56.041 --> 01:05:58.562
Well, you're mistaken.
It's a Mexican dollar.

01:06:00.267 --> 01:06:03.912
You see, Johnny? What you don't see
yourself, you can't swear to be true.

01:06:03.979 --> 01:06:07.144
You can't always swear
that what you do see is true.

01:06:07.501 --> 01:06:10.152
Well, anyway, Camrose was
losing a lot of money at poker...

01:06:10.221 --> 01:06:11.399
Hearsay, Johnny.

01:06:11.469 --> 01:06:14.023
You're trying a man
for his life.

01:06:14.094 --> 01:06:16.483
Life is precious
to all of you, isn't it?

01:06:16.558 --> 01:06:18.151
Well, it's precious
to George Camrose.

01:06:18.223 --> 01:06:20.907
Life was good to Mclver, too,
and it was took from him.

01:06:20.975 --> 01:06:22.983
Was it? Well, that's what
we're here to find out.

01:06:23.056 --> 01:06:25.610
A murder trial calls for a proper
judge and jury, doesn't it, Jonas?

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:27.536
They understand that.
Course we do.

01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:33.512
Get on with it.

01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:35.181
Lestrade.

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:41.162
Lestrade, did Camrose
play poker with you?

01:06:41.235 --> 01:06:42.544
Frequently.

01:06:42.772 --> 01:06:44.332
Did he lose money?

01:06:44.403 --> 01:06:45.680
Considerable.

01:06:45.748 --> 01:06:47.854
How much would you say
he lost?

01:06:47.925 --> 01:06:50.413
In the course of a year,
maybe $5,000.

01:06:51.893 --> 01:06:53.322
Where did you get it from?

01:06:53.398 --> 01:06:54.925
I won't say.
You've gotta say.

01:06:54.998 --> 01:06:57.552
You can't compel an accused
man to answer questions, Johnny.

01:06:57.623 --> 01:06:58.605
That's the law.

01:06:58.679 --> 01:07:01.941
If a man's innocent, why should
he be afraid to answer questions?

01:07:02.008 --> 01:07:03.153
Linnet,

01:07:04.601 --> 01:07:07.023
did you ever see Camrose take
pokes out of the office safe

01:07:07.097 --> 01:07:08.853
and pour dust
from one to the other?

01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:10.132
Yes.
When?

01:07:10.778 --> 01:07:13.626
It was the night before
Mclver was found in the creek.

01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:16.855
I happened to see a light and
I looked through the shutter.

01:07:16.923 --> 01:07:19.193
Do you make a habit
of spying on people?

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:22.075
No, but I've got a habit
of observing people.

01:07:22.236 --> 01:07:24.212
Is that all you have to do?

01:07:24.285 --> 01:07:26.804
Well, Logan, you've got
a big store and no time,

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.692
and I've got a little store
and lots of time.

01:07:31.198 --> 01:07:32.605
Order! Order!

01:07:33.342 --> 01:07:35.164
Get on with it, Johnny.

01:07:35.806 --> 01:07:37.083
All right.

01:07:37.247 --> 01:07:39.614
Now, then,
Mclver came into town.

01:07:40.319 --> 01:07:43.582
The next morning, he was found
dead with his face in the creek.

01:07:43.681 --> 01:07:46.583
We didn't find any dust on
him, but we did find this,

01:07:46.657 --> 01:07:49.527
a receipt that Camrose
gave Mack for his dust.

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:56.353
That's your writing, George?
Yes.

01:07:56.579 --> 01:07:59.394
If you gave him his dust, why
didn't you take back the receipt?

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:00.954
I seldom give receipts.

01:08:01.028 --> 01:08:02.938
You remember, Johnny,
I never gave you one.

01:08:03.013 --> 01:08:04.442
I just put your dust
in the safe

01:08:04.517 --> 01:08:06.939
and when you asked for it,
you got it.

01:08:07.206 --> 01:08:10.305
It's been my usual custom,
all you boys know that.

01:08:13.094 --> 01:08:15.234
But Mclver wanted a receipt.

01:08:15.303 --> 01:08:17.921
I merely forgot to ask for it
when I gave him back his dust.

01:08:17.991 --> 01:08:19.551
Careless, I'd say.

01:08:19.719 --> 01:08:23.015
We're all careless with gold,
it's the cheapest thing in camp.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.770
Is that all, Johnny?

01:08:25.448 --> 01:08:27.270
If so, it's not enough.

01:08:28.042 --> 01:08:31.010
On the testimony of a man
squinting through his shutter,

01:08:31.082 --> 01:08:33.734
you've tried to show
that Camrose is dishonest.

01:08:33.803 --> 01:08:35.975
And on the basis
of an unreturned receipt,

01:08:36.042 --> 01:08:38.312
you deny he gave Mclver
back his dust.

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.169
You've proved nothing.

01:08:44.877 --> 01:08:46.438
Tell them, Linnet.

01:08:46.604 --> 01:08:49.453
Well, he came into my store
a couple of days ago

01:08:49.518 --> 01:08:52.421
and traded me a nugget, and I
noticed it was shaped like a shamrock,

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:55.725
so I put it in a box, set it
up in my store for good luck.

01:08:55.792 --> 01:08:57.930
Why, that's Mack's lucky
piece. He always carried it.

01:08:57.999 --> 01:08:59.176
Shamrock. That's Mack's.

01:08:59.247 --> 01:09:00.295
I know that nugget.

01:09:00.368 --> 01:09:02.124
That's it.
Sure, it was Mack's.

01:09:02.192 --> 01:09:04.046
Well, there's the case,
Logan.

01:09:04.113 --> 01:09:05.804
Twist it if you can.

01:09:06.193 --> 01:09:07.720
Camrose could only
have gotten that nugget

01:09:07.792 --> 01:09:09.965
at a time
when Mack couldn't resist.

01:09:10.033 --> 01:09:12.368
In other words,
when Mack was dead.

01:09:12.627 --> 01:09:14.569
I make murder out of that.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:17.770
Let's vote on it.
Let's vote.

01:09:19.475 --> 01:09:22.062
Just a moment.
Just a moment, all of you.

01:09:22.549 --> 01:09:24.524
This meeting has no sanction.

01:09:24.598 --> 01:09:27.761
If you vote this man guilty, you must
still hold him over to a regular court.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.595
Remember this.

01:09:32.183 --> 01:09:34.671
Remember, if you vote this
man dead on that set of facts,

01:09:34.743 --> 01:09:36.206
you'll be setting the scene
for another day

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:38.036
when you may be
voting yourself dead.

01:09:38.104 --> 01:09:40.591
Vote!
Vote!

01:09:40.665 --> 01:09:42.094
Let's vote!

01:09:43.705 --> 01:09:46.389
All those who think he's guilty, say so.

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.024
Guilty.

01:09:51.450 --> 01:09:53.206
Guilty.
Hurray!

01:10:17.024 --> 01:10:19.261
Did you know about the nugget? No.

01:10:27.586 --> 01:10:29.495
They'll hang him tonight.

01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:31.709
They'll just wait
till it's dark.

01:10:31.778 --> 01:10:34.015
You've done
all you could, Logan.

01:10:38.532 --> 01:10:40.420
Guilty.
Oh!

01:10:42.693 --> 01:10:44.700
Dad, do you think
he did it?

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:47.619
Well, he's a weak man.

01:10:49.447 --> 01:10:51.836
Let's get along, Lucy.
Logan...

01:10:51.911 --> 01:10:53.821
Lucy, Logan did everything
he could.

01:10:53.896 --> 01:10:56.001
Don't ask him to do any more.

01:11:12.076 --> 01:11:14.149
Don't give us any trouble,
Logan.

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.383
It would be disagreeable, but
disagreeable or not, we'd shoot you.

01:11:17.452 --> 01:11:19.787
That's plain.
I'm glad you told me.

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:21.959
Don't do it, Logan.

01:11:31.952 --> 01:11:33.741
You've done enough,
haven't you?

01:11:33.808 --> 01:11:35.881
No man has to go
against reason.

01:11:35.952 --> 01:11:37.097
Reason?

01:11:37.649 --> 01:11:39.820
Is that what
makes a man hungry?

01:11:39.889 --> 01:11:41.865
Is it reason
makes him fight

01:11:41.938 --> 01:11:44.786
or sends him in to
Stutchell's to have a drink

01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:46.094
or makes him
stand by a friend?

01:11:46.162 --> 01:11:48.072
What does make him, then?

01:11:48.691 --> 01:11:50.796
Something deeper than reason.

01:12:10.135 --> 01:12:12.274
The Indians have broken loose.

01:12:19.129 --> 01:12:20.820
They've broken out.
How far did you come?

01:12:20.889 --> 01:12:24.665
Well, I guess about 40 miles.
They're about 12 miles behind me here.

01:12:29.756 --> 01:12:31.578
They are?
How far away are they?

01:12:36.605 --> 01:12:39.573
They got their war paint on? Sure.

01:12:40.414 --> 01:12:41.908
How big a party?

01:12:48.478 --> 01:12:50.388
George, pull on the door.

01:12:57.441 --> 01:12:59.481
Here. Take the black horse
in my barn.

01:12:59.553 --> 01:13:02.423
Watch your chance, get up
to the hills and keep going.

01:13:02.498 --> 01:13:04.408
Thanks, Logan.
Thanks for your confidence.

01:13:04.483 --> 01:13:06.305
Don't flatter yourself.

01:13:06.499 --> 01:13:08.539
What are you doing this for?

01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:10.814
For Lucy's sake?

01:13:10.884 --> 01:13:12.706
You don't want her to see
me strung up, is that it?

01:13:12.773 --> 01:13:14.813
Something like that,
I guess.

01:13:34.248 --> 01:13:36.835
Everything's on fire
all along the line.

01:13:37.129 --> 01:13:38.984
My wife's dead
and my little girl's dead.

01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:40.511
How many Indians
did you see?

01:13:40.585 --> 01:13:42.015
Big band? Little band?

01:13:42.089 --> 01:13:43.300
What made them break out?

01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:45.258
I couldn't say for sure.

01:13:45.419 --> 01:13:48.616
The ferry man said it was on account
of Honey Bragg killing an Indian girl.

01:13:48.683 --> 01:13:50.178
Which way are they heading?

01:13:50.252 --> 01:13:51.714
Toward Dance's.

01:13:52.397 --> 01:13:53.957
A man ought to be
tougher than that.

01:13:54.028 --> 01:13:56.003
That's a fool remark,
Johnny.

01:13:56.077 --> 01:13:57.834
We'll have to raise a company.
Sixty men or more.

01:13:57.902 --> 01:13:59.790
Count me in.
Me, too.

01:14:00.206 --> 01:14:02.116
I'll go.
On that mule?

01:14:02.191 --> 01:14:03.849
She can run. Well, you
better stay here just in case.

01:14:03.919 --> 01:14:04.902
Come on, let's go.

01:14:04.975 --> 01:14:06.732
Just in case
they head this way.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.742
He's gone. He broke out.
Broke out? How?

01:14:08.816 --> 01:14:11.632
He busted the lock.
Why didn't you watch him?

01:14:14.193 --> 01:14:15.884
I warned you, Logan.

01:14:18.738 --> 01:14:21.356
You're making
long guesses again, Johnny.

01:14:22.226 --> 01:14:23.600
Whoever's going,
be here in 20 minutes.

01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:25.674
Grub enough for three days.

01:14:26.451 --> 01:14:28.841
We'll take care
of you later, Logan.

01:15:24.863 --> 01:15:27.352
There.
Now you can let it down.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.368
There we are.

01:15:30.529 --> 01:15:33.017
Liza, you're just about the best
little helper a man ever had.

01:15:33.089 --> 01:15:34.518
Oh.

01:16:43.727 --> 01:16:44.774
All right.

01:16:44.912 --> 01:16:46.254
How big an outfit
was it, Logan?

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:49.550
Thirty mules. I wonder if
Morrow and Blazier got away.

01:17:15.414 --> 01:17:16.691
Hello!

01:17:23.447 --> 01:17:25.335
We were jumped, Logan,
Morrow was killed.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.545
How are things here?
Bad.

01:17:26.616 --> 01:17:28.472
Mr. Dance is dead
and young Asa, too.

01:17:28.537 --> 01:17:29.617
Where's Caroline?
She's gone.

01:17:29.689 --> 01:17:30.834
She's up in the brush
hunting a cow.

01:17:30.905 --> 01:17:33.655
I found her trail,
but I couldn't follow it.

01:17:40.507 --> 01:17:43.443
I'll have coffee for you all
in a little while.

01:17:43.644 --> 01:17:46.132
We'll take you up to the ferry,
Mrs. Dance. It'll be safer.

01:17:46.204 --> 01:17:47.317
No, I wouldn't...

01:17:47.389 --> 01:17:50.772
I wouldn't feel easy under
foot in another woman's house.

01:17:54.111 --> 01:17:56.533
Well, what kind of dress
was Caroline wearing?

01:17:56.607 --> 01:17:57.785
Gingham.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.993
Blue and white checked.

01:18:00.064 --> 01:18:01.722
Did she have a gun?

01:18:03.297 --> 01:18:04.507
I...

01:18:05.088 --> 01:18:06.682
I don't recollect.

01:18:07.906 --> 01:18:11.484
There was firing all around
while the red beasters were here.

01:18:11.650 --> 01:18:13.690
My Ben was killed right off.

01:18:15.266 --> 01:18:17.471
It was him
I was thinking about,

01:18:18.435 --> 01:18:19.995
not anybody else.

01:18:24.676 --> 01:18:27.547
Caroline was out
looking for that no horn cow.

01:18:28.165 --> 01:18:31.035
She's a breechy creature,
always knocking down the fence

01:18:31.109 --> 01:18:33.281
and some kind of grass up in
the canyon that she yearned for.

01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:35.293
Who's that? Sing out!

01:18:35.943 --> 01:18:37.252
Hey!

01:18:45.513 --> 01:18:47.236
I'm coming in.

01:18:48.138 --> 01:18:49.797
Stay where you are!

01:18:50.922 --> 01:18:52.351
I'm dead beat.

01:18:56.875 --> 01:19:00.192
Do you want me hanging from
a tree skinned and dressed?

01:19:00.331 --> 01:19:02.437
You got nothing
coming to you.

01:19:02.732 --> 01:19:04.161
I'm coming in.

01:19:31.699 --> 01:19:32.812
Logan!

01:19:43.156 --> 01:19:44.171
Hey!

01:19:44.469 --> 01:19:46.029
Come here, quick.

01:19:49.238 --> 01:19:50.547
Caroline's.

01:21:35.179 --> 01:21:36.390
Caroline.

01:21:45.069 --> 01:21:46.280
Caroline.

01:21:49.743 --> 01:21:51.304
How are they all?

01:21:53.615 --> 01:21:55.503
Mrs. Dance is all right.

01:21:56.529 --> 01:21:57.544
Ben?

01:21:59.376 --> 01:22:01.067
He's dead, Caroline.

01:22:01.489 --> 01:22:02.766
So is Asa.

01:22:28.311 --> 01:22:29.521
Caroline.

01:22:30.135 --> 01:22:34.031
I want all of you to come back to
Jacksonville. Put up at my place.

01:22:34.296 --> 01:22:36.303
I wouldn't want to do that.

01:22:36.728 --> 01:22:38.616
You'll be doing it soon.

01:22:42.298 --> 01:22:44.599
I don't want to
leave here, Logan.

01:22:45.338 --> 01:22:47.542
I can never be
a town woman again.

01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:49.618
I could never be a woman
moving around.

01:22:49.914 --> 01:22:52.468
I... I'd disappoint you.

01:22:53.724 --> 01:22:56.659
It came to me last night.
We're not the same.

01:22:57.533 --> 01:23:00.468
And then today, when you
found me, you and Vane,

01:23:00.797 --> 01:23:02.107
I was sure.

01:23:05.342 --> 01:23:08.310
I want to look out of the
window and see my man plowing.

01:23:08.383 --> 01:23:11.417
And in the evening, see
him in the kitchen rocker.

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:14.976
You're thinking of Vane.

01:23:16.192 --> 01:23:19.160
I'm thinking I'm not
hurting you too much, Logan.

01:23:19.841 --> 01:23:23.519
And as time went by, I'd
be hurting you, is that it?

01:23:25.059 --> 01:23:26.335
That's it.

01:23:59.274 --> 01:24:01.892
Caroline, crying
helps some people a lot.

01:24:03.083 --> 01:24:05.123
Some people it doesn't help.

01:24:21.549 --> 01:24:23.011
You folks all right?
Oh, yes.

01:24:23.086 --> 01:24:24.134
But what about the Dances?

01:24:24.207 --> 01:24:25.483
They were hit pretty bad.

01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:27.820
Ben and little Asa were
killed. Oh, and Caroline?

01:24:27.887 --> 01:24:28.967
Caroline's all right.

01:24:29.039 --> 01:24:31.560
Well, didn't you bring her back with
you? It's dangerous where she is.

01:24:31.632 --> 01:24:33.323
She didn't come.
She doesn't like towns.

01:24:33.392 --> 01:24:35.564
Well, she'd better get to like
them if she's marrying you.

01:24:35.632 --> 01:24:38.121
She's not.
She's marrying Blazier.

01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:05.293
Well, what did I tell you?

01:25:06.135 --> 01:25:07.083
About what?

01:25:07.159 --> 01:25:09.200
About the trouble
that always comes.

01:25:09.272 --> 01:25:12.851
And your Crescent pack string was
destroyed over in the Applegate.

01:25:12.921 --> 01:25:15.158
The Scottsburg outfit's
gone, too.

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:17.137
Blazier got clear.

01:25:17.209 --> 01:25:19.315
You know how you stand,
Logan?

01:25:21.274 --> 01:25:22.681
You're broke.

01:25:34.813 --> 01:25:36.952
This is what you lent Camrose.

01:25:38.110 --> 01:25:39.452
Where is he?

01:25:41.919 --> 01:25:42.999
Indians get him?

01:25:43.071 --> 01:25:45.210
No, one of the boys.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.443
Never mind which one.

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:57.211
There was a lot of good
in George.

01:25:57.282 --> 01:25:59.584
Yeah, he sure
panned out no color.

01:26:00.354 --> 01:26:03.999
It's a thin margin, Johnny,
between what could be and what is.

01:26:04.099 --> 01:26:05.179
Yeah.

01:26:05.251 --> 01:26:07.390
It was thin for you
last night.

01:26:07.971 --> 01:26:09.979
We were a mind to hang you.

01:26:14.374 --> 01:26:15.421
Lucy.

01:26:16.518 --> 01:26:18.657
You see how thin
the margin is.

01:26:21.543 --> 01:26:23.583
Did you know about this?
Yes.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.026
In some other kind of country,
he might have made the grade.

01:26:34.344 --> 01:26:35.839
There's not much left,
is there?

01:26:35.913 --> 01:26:36.960
Not much.

01:26:37.033 --> 01:26:41.573
Well, Logan, now you haven't got any
store, but you've got lots of time.

01:26:43.371 --> 01:26:45.892
I guess I'll have to make that
trip to San Francisco after all.

01:26:45.964 --> 01:26:47.906
See if I can rustle up
some credit.

01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:49.574
Want some company?

01:26:50.124 --> 01:26:52.329
If you can keep up
on that mule.

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:54.348
I'll see you.

01:26:55.725 --> 01:26:58.147
When are you leaving?
In the morning.

01:26:59.855 --> 01:27:00.968
Logan,

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:05.166
would you mind having
a woman on your hands?

01:27:11.409 --> 01:27:13.898
<i>Oh, buttermilk sky</i>

01:27:13.969 --> 01:27:16.785
<i>Can't you see
my little donkey and me?</i>

01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:19.053
<i>We're as happy
as a Christmas tree</i>

01:27:19.122 --> 01:27:21.326
<i>Heading for the one I love</i>

01:27:22.131 --> 01:27:24.139
<i>I'm gonna pop her the question</i>

01:27:24.211 --> 01:27:25.837
<i>That question</i>

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:28.047
<i>Do you, darling?
Do you, do?</i>

01:27:28.116 --> 01:27:31.150
<i>It'll be easy, so easy</i>

01:27:31.221 --> 01:27:33.131
<i>If I can only bank on you</i>

01:27:33.205 --> 01:27:35.345
<i>Oh, buttermilk sky</i>

01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:37.554
<i>I'm telling you why</i>

01:27:37.622 --> 01:27:41.168
<i>Now you know,
keep it in mind tonight</i>

01:27:41.335 --> 01:27:43.823
<i>Keep brushing those clouds
from sight</i>

01:27:44.087 --> 01:27:46.357
<i>Oh, buttermilk sky</i>

01:27:46.649 --> 01:27:49.431
<i>Don't you fail me
when I'm needing you most</i>

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:51.799
<i>Hang a moon
above her hitching post</i>

01:27:51.865 --> 01:27:54.964
<i>Hitch me to the one I love</i>

01:27:55.305 --> 01:28:01.653
