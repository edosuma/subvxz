00:01.120 --> 00:02.180
<i>- Previously</i>
<i>on "The Practice"...</i>

00:02.180 --> 00:04.090
- I was at the preliminary
hearing,

00:04.090 --> 00:06.200
where you testified that
your father shot your mother.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.119
- And that wasn't the truth.

00:08.119 --> 00:10.070
- Why would you wait till now
to change your story?

00:10.070 --> 00:11.170
- I just couldn't go through
with it.

00:11.170 --> 00:13.080
What do you think I should do?

00:13.080 --> 00:15.100
- Well, I would normally
advise you to tell the truth,

00:15.100 --> 00:17.000
but if the truth is something
different than

00:17.000 --> 00:19.050
what you said at the prelim,
telling the truth

00:19.050 --> 00:22.000
would expose you
to perjury charges.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.140
- He's my dad.

00:23.140 --> 00:25.040
- If it wasn't true,
what really happened?

00:25.040 --> 00:26.040
- I was angry.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.000
My father pulled the gun on me,

00:28.000 --> 00:29.150
then I basically attacked him.

00:29.150 --> 00:31.030
Look, I'm sorry
about all of this,

00:31.030 --> 00:33.050
but it really was an accident.

00:33.050 --> 00:36.230
- We find the defendant,
Gordon Armbrust, not guilty.

00:36.230 --> 00:38.230
- Gary Armbrust,
you're under arrest

00:38.230 --> 00:40.060
for the murder
of Charlotte Armbrust.

00:40.060 --> 00:41.180
- What?!
- What's going on here?

00:41.180 --> 00:43.230
- By his own testimony,
as well as his father's,

00:43.230 --> 00:46.020
the gun went off
when he attacked his father.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.170
Accidental shooting or not,
felony murder rule applies.

00:48.170 --> 00:50.100
- What is she talking about?

00:50.100 --> 00:52.140
- You're looking at an automatic
life sentence, Gary.

00:52.140 --> 00:53.230
That's what I'm talking about.

00:53.230 --> 00:55.020
- Is this true?

00:55.020 --> 00:56.210
Could I get life?

00:56.210 --> 00:58.010
Tell me!

00:58.010 --> 00:59.200
What the hell is going on?

01:03.060 --> 01:05.010
- Basically, felony murder.

01:05.010 --> 01:07.060
If, in the commission
of a felony, murder happens,

01:07.060 --> 01:09.180
they can get you for murder,
even if it's accidental.

01:09.180 --> 01:11.130
Intent doesn't matter.

01:11.130 --> 01:14.160
- Well, what was my felony?
- Your attack on your father.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.070
The D.A.'s
calling it aggravated,

01:16.070 --> 01:18.020
which brings it up to felony.

01:18.020 --> 01:20.070
Which means she can push through
with felony murder.

01:20.070 --> 01:22.110
It's completely bogus, Gary.

01:22.110 --> 01:23.200
She is punishing you

01:23.200 --> 01:25.140
for refusing to testify
against your dad.

01:25.140 --> 01:26.150
- Well, can this stick?

01:26.150 --> 01:28.010
- I'm bringing a motion

01:28.010 --> 01:29.140
to have it kicked,
and I hope the judge--

01:29.140 --> 01:31.050
- Why didn't you tell me
they could do this?

01:31.050 --> 01:33.040
- It's an outrageous charge.
She is angry.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.190
- You told me that I was
facing perjury, Ellenor.

01:35.190 --> 01:37.130
That's what you said.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.090
And now I'm going up on murder.

01:39.090 --> 01:40.180
Why didn't you tell me?

01:40.180 --> 01:42.060
- I'm gonna take care of it.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.030
She knows
you didn't commit the crime.

01:44.030 --> 01:46.220
It is completely punitive.
I'm going to take care of it.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.020
- Forget it.

01:50.020 --> 01:51.070
- Come on, Helen,
you know this--

01:51.070 --> 01:52.150
- Your kid made a choice,
Ellenor.

01:52.150 --> 01:53.150
- My kid?

01:53.150 --> 01:54.160
I took him at your request

01:54.160 --> 01:56.070
to advise him against perjury.

01:56.070 --> 01:57.210
You never threw out the
possibility of felony murder.

01:57.210 --> 01:59.110
- 'Cause I hadn't thought
of it then.

01:59.110 --> 02:01.100
- This is prosecutorial
misconduct, and you know it.

02:01.100 --> 02:05.110
- Ellenor, bring your motion.
I'm not letting him go!

02:05.110 --> 02:09.199
- Helen, listen to the sound
of your voice.

02:09.199 --> 02:12.060
You've lost your way.

02:12.060 --> 02:13.140
- Somebody was murdered.

02:13.140 --> 02:15.160
Somebody's gonna pay for it.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.220
That's my way.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.030
She's just a little motivated.

This is a nightmare.

03:18.110 --> 03:20.130
- Anybody want
an attempted murder?

03:20.130 --> 03:22.200
I got Sybil Boyle
from the PD's office.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.100
They got a guy
who's fired six lawyers,

03:24.100 --> 03:25.120
trial starts tomorrow.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.190
They're looking to Lujack.

03:26.190 --> 03:28.060
- Tell them thanks,
but no thanks.

03:28.060 --> 03:29.180
- I'll do it.

03:29.180 --> 03:31.100
Attempted murder
beats paperwork.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.180
- You know, Rebecca,

03:32.180 --> 03:34.100
when you were
office administrator,

03:34.100 --> 03:35.120
you'd kick and scream
at all the pro bono stuff.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.010
Now that you're a lawyer...

03:37.010 --> 03:38.190
- Like you all say,
it's good experience.

03:38.190 --> 03:40.110
- Well, I got her on hold here.

03:40.110 --> 03:41.230
- Tell her I'll do it.
- Okay.

03:46.050 --> 03:48.180
- She was convinced she looked
better with higher cheekbones.

03:48.180 --> 03:50.040
I thought it ridiculous, but--

03:50.040 --> 03:52.190
- But your wife wanted them.
- Yes.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.110
So she went in to get implants.

03:54.110 --> 03:56.050
They told us
it would be pretty routine.

03:56.050 --> 03:57.160
- "They" being...

03:57.160 --> 04:00.040
- Dr. Leach
and the others at the hospital.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.020
She went
in on a Monday,

04:01.020 --> 04:02.160
had the surgery on Tuesday,

04:02.160 --> 04:04.060
and came home that day.

04:04.060 --> 04:06.070
- And everything seemed okay.

04:06.070 --> 04:09.070
- Well, she was swollen
and in some pain,

04:09.070 --> 04:10.190
but they gave her medication.

04:10.190 --> 04:14.060
Everything seemed okay
until Wednesday night.

04:14.060 --> 04:16.160
- What happened then, sir?

04:16.160 --> 04:19.029
- She complained
about having a fever,

04:19.029 --> 04:23.200
and then,
suddenly, just blacks out.

04:23.200 --> 04:27.000
I called 911,
and the paramedics came.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.170
They, uh...

04:30.170 --> 04:33.050
They said she had no pulse.

04:33.050 --> 04:36.120
They brought out those...

04:36.120 --> 04:41.090
shock paddle things
and started, uh, jolting her.

04:41.090 --> 04:44.120
And then they stopped.

04:44.120 --> 04:47.130
She was gone.

04:47.130 --> 04:51.050
- Did Dr. Leach offer any
explanation?

04:51.050 --> 04:53.120
- He said she got an infection.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.190
- From the operation.
- He didn't know.

04:55.190 --> 04:57.190
He said she could have
gotten it at the hospital,

04:57.190 --> 04:59.060
or she could have gotten it
at home.

04:59.060 --> 05:00.170
He said...

05:00.170 --> 05:03.000
These things happen sometimes.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.060
- But you believe Dr. Leach
did something wrong.

05:08.060 --> 05:10.040
- Yes.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.180
- Why, Mr. Minor?

05:11.180 --> 05:13.020
- The way he told me, the way

05:13.020 --> 05:15.090
he cut our conversations
short ever

05:15.090 --> 05:17.040
since, the way
he wouldn't talk anymore.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.210
He did something wrong.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.080
- Mr. Little,
my name is Rebecca Washington.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.100
I'm your new lawyer.

05:37.130 --> 05:39.110
I understand
you've had some difficulty

05:39.110 --> 05:41.090
with your six previous lawyers,

05:41.090 --> 05:43.160
anything in particular
they got wrong,

05:43.160 --> 05:45.030
I'd like to get a head start.

05:47.190 --> 05:50.070
- I didn't like them.

05:50.070 --> 05:51.190
- Okay, well, uh,

05:51.190 --> 05:53.040
since your trial
starts tomorrow,

05:53.040 --> 05:55.010
I need to get up to speed.

05:55.010 --> 05:58.110
So according to the officers,
you fired a revolver at them.

06:01.010 --> 06:02.070
Did that happen?

06:04.170 --> 06:06.160
- No.

06:06.160 --> 06:10.030
- Okay, two officers
are testifying it did.

06:10.030 --> 06:13.170
Do we have anybody on your side
to say it didn't?

06:13.170 --> 06:16.020
- No.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.070
- Okay.

06:19.050 --> 06:21.100
- This charge
is clearly punitive.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.110
The district attorney
has no good faith belief

06:23.110 --> 06:25.100
that the defendant
is guilty of felony murder.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.030
- Defense counsel
has no foundation

06:27.030 --> 06:28.130
to evaluate
my good faith from this.

06:28.130 --> 06:30.220
- She was prosecuting the father
for murder.

06:30.220 --> 06:33.060
- The defendant admitted
to attacking his father,

06:33.060 --> 06:34.160
causing the gun to go off.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.010
- But you don't believe that,
Helen.

06:36.010 --> 06:37.020
- Oh, again,
you're a mind reader--

06:37.020 --> 06:38.030
- No.
I have ears.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.210
You stood in front of the jury,

06:39.210 --> 06:41.130
and you said that Gary Armbrust
was making this whole thing

06:41.130 --> 06:43.230
up to spare his father
a life sentence.

06:43.230 --> 06:45.210
- Counsel,
these are questions of fact.

06:45.210 --> 06:48.030
The boy stated under oath
he assaulted his father.

06:48.030 --> 06:49.080
That's enough
for me to hold him.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.190
- Even assuming that to be true,

06:50.190 --> 06:52.190
felony murder
still doesn't apply.

06:52.190 --> 06:54.110
That law
was designed

06:54.110 --> 06:57.040
for robberies
or kidnappings, rapes,

06:57.040 --> 06:58.230
felonies
for which it is foreseeable

06:58.230 --> 07:00.070
that a murder could result.

07:00.070 --> 07:01.110
- You charge a man
with a gun,

07:01.110 --> 07:03.050
it's foreseeable
it could go off.

07:03.050 --> 07:05.210
- I would also remind the court
of the Merger Doctrine.

07:05.210 --> 07:08.070
The felony
act has to be independent

07:08.070 --> 07:10.110
of the killing
for a felony murder to apply.

07:10.110 --> 07:13.180
Here, it was the alleged felony
itself that caused the death--

07:13.180 --> 07:16.070
- Massachusetts has never
recognized the Merger Doctrine.

07:16.070 --> 07:18.100
- Can I finish?
- Actually, you have.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.000
I'm denying the motion
to dismiss.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.110
The charges stand.

07:21.110 --> 07:23.110
The defendant will be
held without bail.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.160
We can conference Wednesday
to set a trial date.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.190
- This is a railroad.
- What, excuse me?

07:28.190 --> 07:30.170
- This boy is being charged
with a crime

07:30.170 --> 07:32.110
we all know he didn't commit.

07:32.110 --> 07:35.170
- Well, next time he should
think better of confessing.

07:35.170 --> 07:36.210
Next case.

07:39.190 --> 07:42.070
- She had gone
into septic shock.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.220
That led to full cardiac arrest.

07:44.220 --> 07:47.020
Which ultimately was the cause
of death.

07:47.020 --> 07:48.210
- And, Doctor,
do you have an opinion

07:48.210 --> 07:51.130
as to what caused Mrs. Minor
to go into septic shock?

07:51.130 --> 07:54.020
- The blood tests
show a massive infection caused

07:54.020 --> 07:55.210
by streptococcus bacteria.

07:55.210 --> 07:58.090
This would explain
why her fever spiked.

07:58.090 --> 08:00.060
- And, Doctor,
do you have an opinion

08:00.060 --> 08:03.100
as to how Mrs. Minor
became exposed to this bacteria?

08:03.100 --> 08:05.110
- It had to happen
during her cheek bone

08:05.110 --> 08:07.000
implant operation.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.050
The likelihood is
there was some contamination

08:09.050 --> 08:11.060
in the operating room.

08:11.060 --> 08:13.120
- You can establish that,
for a fact?

08:13.120 --> 08:16.030
- Well, we can't say it
to a medical certainty,

08:16.030 --> 08:18.230
but since all other explanations
have been eliminated, I--

08:18.230 --> 08:21.210
- No autopsy was done on
the patient, was there, Doctor?

08:21.210 --> 08:23.030
- No,
and there should have been.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.100
- Well, without an autopsy,

08:24.100 --> 08:26.060
we can never really
know for sure

08:26.060 --> 08:28.100
what killed Mrs. Minor, can we?

08:28.100 --> 08:31.130
- When a postoperative patient
goes into septic shock

08:31.130 --> 08:32.179
within 48 hours
of the operation--

08:32.179 --> 08:34.070
- Move to strike,
nonresponsive--

08:34.070 --> 08:35.150
- We know!
- Move to strike!

08:35.150 --> 08:37.020
- Overruled.

08:37.020 --> 08:40.049
- People should not die
from cosmetic surgery.

08:40.049 --> 08:43.200
- Did you ever examine
Mrs. Minor, Dr. Reynolds?

08:43.200 --> 08:45.020
- No.
- You ever meet her?

08:45.020 --> 08:46.080
- No.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.100
- Ever see her body
after the death?

08:47.100 --> 08:48.160
- No, but that has--

08:48.160 --> 08:50.050
- You answered the question,
sir.

08:50.050 --> 08:52.080
- Are you being paid
for today's testimony?

08:52.080 --> 08:54.210
- Objection!
- Overruled.

08:54.210 --> 08:56.060
- Are you being paid, sir?

08:56.060 --> 08:57.060
- Yes.
- How much?

08:57.060 --> 08:59.020
- $7,500.

08:59.020 --> 09:02.130
- How many court cases do you
testify in per year, do you--

09:02.130 --> 09:04.190
- Objection;
this is completely irrelevant.

09:04.190 --> 09:06.050
- I'll allow it.

09:06.050 --> 09:09.040
- How many cases, sir?
- I have no idea.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.060
- More than 50?
- Probably.

09:11.060 --> 09:13.030
- In fact,
that's what you do, isn't it?

09:13.030 --> 09:15.190
You're a hired gun who goes
from courthouse to courthouse.

09:15.190 --> 09:17.230
You're on every plaintiff
attorney's list, aren't you?

09:17.230 --> 09:19.000
- Objection!
- Objection!

09:19.000 --> 09:20.060
- Sustained.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.200
- You have no evidence

09:21.200 --> 09:24.150
that my client did
anything negligent, do you, sir?

09:24.150 --> 09:26.110
- When one
of his patients dies--

09:26.110 --> 09:28.000
- Please answer the question.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.100
I'm not asking
for any assumptions.

09:30.100 --> 09:33.000
You cannot point
to any specific incidents

09:33.000 --> 09:37.180
of negligence with respect
to Dr. Leach, can you?

09:37.180 --> 09:38.180
- No.

09:38.180 --> 09:40.180
I wasn't in the room.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.110
- Thank you, Doctor.

09:48.180 --> 09:51.210
- I was going to visit a friend.
- At 3:00 in the morning?

09:51.210 --> 09:53.040
- Yeah.
- And then?

09:53.040 --> 09:55.180
- I heard shots,
I ran, they grabbed me.

09:55.180 --> 09:57.060
What, that's not in there?

09:57.060 --> 09:59.030
Those other six lawyers
didn't take notes?

09:59.030 --> 10:02.050
- The police said you had--
- I know what they said!

10:02.050 --> 10:04.050
Didn't happen.

10:04.050 --> 10:05.200
- Okay.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.210
The friend you went to see,
never saw him.

10:07.210 --> 10:09.190
- I had the wrong address.

10:09.190 --> 10:11.170
- Okay, can you tell me
anything else?

10:11.170 --> 10:14.050
- Nope.
- Okay.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.090
I want you to think
about something.

10:19.090 --> 10:20.230
That building was dark.

10:20.230 --> 10:22.060
The police were shooting.

10:22.060 --> 10:23.140
Self-defense is a possible line
of--

10:23.140 --> 10:25.100
- I said I didn't do it!

10:25.100 --> 10:28.220
Are you deaf?
Are you deaf?

10:30.150 --> 10:32.040
- No, I'm not deaf.

10:38.030 --> 10:41.200
Please don't scream at me.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.000
Given your, uh,
felony record,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.090
my plan is not
to have you testify.

10:46.090 --> 10:47.160
If you take the stand,

10:47.160 --> 10:49.080
all your priors
can come into evidence,

10:49.080 --> 10:52.070
so for now, I don't plan
to put you in the witness chair.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.090
- Thank you for seeing me.

11:01.090 --> 11:02.190
I thought
if we all got in a room,

11:02.190 --> 11:04.050
I think we can all agree
there's been

11:04.050 --> 11:06.030
a certain level
of frustration at work here.

11:06.030 --> 11:07.170
- Why are you frustrated,
Mr. Hunter?

11:07.170 --> 11:09.120
You got an acquittal
for your client.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.010
- Yes.

11:11.010 --> 11:13.210
If you proceed to try Gary
for felony murder,

11:13.210 --> 11:15.230
that would obviously
be pretty disturbing for Gordon,

11:15.230 --> 11:17.150
and who knows, he might even
get up there

11:17.150 --> 11:20.220
and testify that he shot
his wife of his own accord.

11:20.220 --> 11:22.160
No provocation from Gary.

11:22.160 --> 11:25.170
- In which case, I'd go after
after him for perjury.

11:25.170 --> 11:27.120
- This really is not
about threats.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.030
I came in here to make an offer.

11:29.030 --> 11:31.150
Certainly, if Gordon
did give that testimony,

11:31.150 --> 11:33.060
implicating himself in a crime

11:33.060 --> 11:35.160
for which he's already
been acquitted, then,

11:35.160 --> 11:37.030
double jeopardy would mean...

11:37.030 --> 11:38.070
- Get out.

11:38.070 --> 11:40.090
- Here is the offer.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.190
Gordon will accept a year
on a perjury charge.

11:42.190 --> 11:44.060
I'm sure
Ms. Frutt can convince Gary

11:44.060 --> 11:46.070
to accept a one-year sentence
also on perjury.

11:46.070 --> 11:48.140
That means
no one walks off free,

11:48.140 --> 11:51.070
and the public and you can feel
some sense of vindication.

11:51.070 --> 11:53.050
- How dare you come in here
and even suggest that?

11:53.050 --> 11:54.190
- Helen...
- And you--

11:54.190 --> 11:56.140
- Look, I didn't know
what he was gonna say.

11:56.140 --> 11:59.030
He's the guy you want.
A year is better than nothing.

11:59.030 --> 12:00.220
- Your guy's getting life,
Ellenor.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.110
Life!

12:02.110 --> 12:04.160
As for you,
I'll figure something out.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.190
- You're not gonna figure
anything--

12:05.190 --> 12:07.030
- Get out, Mr. Hunter!
- What?

12:07.030 --> 12:08.060
I am making an offer
that's pretty--

12:08.060 --> 12:09.210
- I said get out!

12:20.230 --> 12:22.220
- Can I talk to you outside
of this case for a second?

12:22.220 --> 12:25.040
- No.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.040
- You could destroy yourself
with this.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.080
Don't let that happen--
- Ellenor, please leave.

12:41.210 --> 12:44.140
- There was some kind of panic.
- By panic, you mean...

12:44.140 --> 12:47.070
- Dr. Leach came rushing in.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.200
It was about 20 minutes
after the call

12:48.200 --> 12:50.160
that Mrs. Minor was dead.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.220
He huddled up with
Dr. Morganson, Chief of Staff.

12:53.220 --> 12:55.120
- Did you hear
what was being said?

12:55.120 --> 12:58.090
- Objection, hearsay.
- Excited utterance.

12:58.090 --> 12:59.210
- I'll allow it.

12:59.210 --> 13:01.070
- What did you hear,
Mrs. Henderson?

13:01.070 --> 13:03.070
- Well, Dr. Morganson
was already upset

13:03.070 --> 13:05.100
over another patient who died.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.190
It's not like him to become
animated, but he was here.

13:07.190 --> 13:10.220
He was demanding lists
of surgical teams,

13:10.220 --> 13:12.160
and he wanted an M
and M conference

13:12.160 --> 13:14.050
that very night.

13:14.050 --> 13:15.210
- What's an M and M conference?

13:15.210 --> 13:18.190
- It's a mortality
and morbidity conference.

13:18.190 --> 13:20.230
Doctors convene secretly
to discuss the cause

13:20.230 --> 13:22.080
of death of patients.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.080
Often for unexplained deaths.

13:24.080 --> 13:26.080
- Do you know the results
of this meeting?

13:26.080 --> 13:28.060
- No, the contents are secret.

13:28.060 --> 13:29.200
Nobody but the doctors
ever finds out

13:29.200 --> 13:31.140
what goes on in there.

13:31.140 --> 13:32.140
- Thank you.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.160
- Gee, you make it sound
like a big conspiracy.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.120
M and M conferences
are routinely held at hospitals,

13:41.120 --> 13:42.190
aren't they, Nurse Henderson?

13:42.190 --> 13:44.080
- Yes, but this was--
- Thank you.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.200
And one of the reasons

13:45.200 --> 13:47.210
that they have these meetings,
among others,

13:47.210 --> 13:51.100
is so that doctors can freely
swap information to learn;

13:51.100 --> 13:53.120
isn't that correct?
- Yes.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.190
- They have these meetings
whether things go wrong or not.

13:55.190 --> 13:57.190
- They seemed to have this one
in a hurry.

13:57.190 --> 14:01.050
- Well, is it possible Dr. Leach
was upset about the death,

14:01.050 --> 14:03.200
and he wanted
to find out quickly

14:03.200 --> 14:05.020
if something went wrong?

14:05.020 --> 14:06.020
Is that possible?

14:06.020 --> 14:07.040
- Yes.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.200
- And here you are,

14:08.200 --> 14:11.080
presenting a doctor's concern
about his patients

14:11.080 --> 14:13.050
as something incriminating?

14:13.050 --> 14:15.190
- Doctors have two kinds
of expressions.

14:15.190 --> 14:17.190
One is concern for the patients.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.000
The other is concern
over liability.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.140
This seemed to be the latter.

14:21.140 --> 14:24.100
- So you've based today's
testimony

14:24.100 --> 14:27.050
on your ability
to read an expression.

14:27.050 --> 14:29.130
- I was there, Mr. Walton.

14:29.130 --> 14:31.060
Something was wrong.

14:31.060 --> 14:33.120
- But you weren't
in that operating room,

14:33.120 --> 14:36.210
were you, Mrs. Henderson?

14:36.210 --> 14:39.210
- No, I wasn't.

14:39.210 --> 14:41.000
- Thank you.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.210
- We had driven into the middle
of a gang shootout.

14:46.210 --> 14:49.050
We pursued several suspects
on foot

14:49.050 --> 14:51.020
into an apartment complex.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.140
We entered into a lobby area,

14:52.140 --> 14:54.110
and we became immediately
under fire.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.220
- Did you see
who was firing at you?

14:56.220 --> 14:59.180
- That man.

14:59.180 --> 15:01.020
- Mr. Little, settle down!

15:01.020 --> 15:03.060
- Judge, this man is lying!

15:03.060 --> 15:05.160
- Your attorney will have
opportunity to cross-examine.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.040
You will remain quiet.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.150
- What happened next, Officer?

15:09.150 --> 15:11.120
- We returned fire,
at which point

15:11.120 --> 15:14.180
he dropped his gun and began
to run for the stairwell.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.080
We entered the stairwell.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.090
We encountered him coming down.

15:18.090 --> 15:19.230
We told him to freeze.

15:19.230 --> 15:21.180
He took off up the stairs.

15:21.180 --> 15:24.180
We pursued him and caught him
and placed him under arrest.

15:24.180 --> 15:26.070
- I never had a gun!
- Mr. Little--

15:26.070 --> 15:27.160
- I never had a gun!

15:27.160 --> 15:29.060
I wasn't even
on that balcony--

15:29.060 --> 15:30.120
I was just going
down the stairs!

15:30.120 --> 15:32.070
- Bailiff, take him out!
Now!

15:32.070 --> 15:33.190
- Hold on.
- Take him out!

15:33.190 --> 15:35.180
People like you need
to respect this room!

15:35.180 --> 15:37.140
This isn't the street in here!

15:37.140 --> 15:40.180
You don't get away with that!

15:40.180 --> 15:43.010
Ms. Washington,
I'll see you in chambers.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.150
Mr. Thompson, you too.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.190
You've got yourself a problem,
young lady.

15:50.190 --> 15:52.080
- Yes, Your Honor,
and for the record,

15:52.080 --> 15:54.000
I don't think
you handled that too deftly.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.110
- What should I have done?

15:55.110 --> 15:57.180
Asked him about his childhood?
His mother?

15:57.180 --> 15:59.070
Hm?
Hm?

15:59.070 --> 16:00.160
Okay, here's your problem.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.020
In addition
to his general scum-hood,

16:03.020 --> 16:05.020
his yelling in court,
in my mind,

16:05.020 --> 16:06.200
is the equivalent of testimony.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.120
The D.A. is now free
to cross-examine him.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.220
- Just hold on a second.

16:09.220 --> 16:11.070
- He yelled
that he was not on the balcony,

16:11.070 --> 16:12.230
and that the officer was lying.

16:12.230 --> 16:14.160
That's testimony, mm-hm.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.180
- But he wasn't under oath!
- The jury heard him!

16:16.180 --> 16:18.090
- If you force him
to take the stand,

16:18.090 --> 16:19.210
all his priors can be admitted.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.110
- Well, isn't that tragic?
- Your Honor.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.200
At this point,

16:22.200 --> 16:24.150
I don't want
to cross-examine him.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.020
Now, this case
is pretty straight for us.

16:26.020 --> 16:27.020
The last thing
I want to do

16:27.020 --> 16:28.220
is give them grounds for appeal.

16:28.220 --> 16:32.020
And you forcing
him to take the stand?

16:32.020 --> 16:34.030
- Well, that's your call.

16:34.030 --> 16:35.150
But for the rest
of the trial,

16:35.150 --> 16:37.020
his hands are cuffed
to the chair,

16:37.020 --> 16:38.140
and his mouth is taped.

16:38.140 --> 16:40.100
- Your Honor,
that would be so prejudicial!

16:40.100 --> 16:42.010
- It's not up for debate!

16:45.140 --> 16:47.100
- When I learned
that she had died,

16:47.100 --> 16:49.220
I, of course, was devastated.

16:49.220 --> 16:52.060
In addition to being my patient,

16:52.060 --> 16:55.000
Mrs. Minor
was an extraordinary person.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.220
We were all quite fond of her.

16:56.220 --> 16:59.070
- Dr. Leach, what happened?

16:59.070 --> 17:00.230
- I don't know.

17:00.230 --> 17:04.200
We'd been through the procedure
over and over and over.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.150
Everything went
according to plan.

17:06.150 --> 17:09.230
Nothing indicated...

17:09.230 --> 17:11.089
- You've heard the suggestion

17:11.089 --> 17:13.140
that Mrs. Minor may have
picked up the infection

17:13.140 --> 17:15.010
during this procedure.

17:15.010 --> 17:18.000
- The room was sterile,
Mr. Walton.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.230
Whatever happened to Mrs. Minor,
it didn't happen in that room.

17:21.230 --> 17:25.079
- Well, could she have gotten
the infection elsewhere?

17:25.079 --> 17:27.230
- I don't know what happened
after she left the hospital,

17:27.230 --> 17:30.050
what happened at her home.

17:30.050 --> 17:34.030
My dialogue with Mr. Minor
stopped at that point, so...

17:34.030 --> 17:35.140
All I can tell you,

17:35.140 --> 17:38.090
whatever caused her to die,

17:38.090 --> 17:42.000
it didn't happen in that room.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.020
Sometimes people die,
Mr. Minor.

17:46.020 --> 17:48.200
And sometimes there's
no explanation as to why.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.140
- People don't just die.

17:50.140 --> 17:52.000
- Mr. Minor.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.030
- They don't just die.
- Mr. Minor!

17:55.030 --> 17:57.170
Doctor, please
don't address the plaintiff.

18:00.090 --> 18:03.020
- This judge isn't gonna go
for any of that stuff.

18:03.020 --> 18:05.190
You have to stay quiet.

18:05.190 --> 18:07.140
We're lucky the D.A. didn't
take him up on his offer

18:07.140 --> 18:10.070
and put you
in the chair to be crossed.

18:10.070 --> 18:13.100
Can you at least look at me?

18:13.100 --> 18:16.080
If your prior felonies
come out, you can forget it.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.110
You got two assaults,
one with a deadly weapon.

18:18.110 --> 18:20.070
That's all the jury
needs to hear.

18:23.030 --> 18:25.060
Now...

18:25.060 --> 18:27.230
I'd like to take a shot
with a plea.

18:27.230 --> 18:31.160
If we can get eight years,
I think we should take it.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.130
- You're still deaf.

18:33.130 --> 18:36.140
- Byron, I'm not saying you did
it, but with the evidence--

18:36.140 --> 18:39.180
- I didn't do it, bitch!
You stupid bitch!

18:39.180 --> 18:41.050
You're just like the rest
of them!

18:41.050 --> 18:42.190
But I bet you hear me now, huh?

18:42.190 --> 18:43.220
I bet you hear me now!

18:43.220 --> 18:45.020
Come here!
Come here!

18:45.020 --> 18:47.000
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

18:47.000 --> 18:48.020
Get off!

18:51.050 --> 18:52.110
Get off of me!

18:52.110 --> 18:55.090
[screaming]

19:12.020 --> 19:13.180
- Hey.
- Don't start.

19:13.180 --> 19:15.020
- I'm gonna start.

19:15.020 --> 19:17.080
- Lindsay...

19:17.080 --> 19:19.120
- Just listen first, okay?

19:19.120 --> 19:23.010
Then I'll shut up.

19:23.010 --> 19:24.060
You don't believe
that kid had anything

19:24.060 --> 19:25.190
to do with the murder.

19:25.190 --> 19:27.010
You're punishing him
because he screwed up

19:27.010 --> 19:28.090
the prosecution of the father,

19:28.090 --> 19:30.050
and in part,
you're punishing Ellenor

19:30.050 --> 19:32.110
for not convincing him
to stick to the truth.

19:32.110 --> 19:33.230
You're coming from anger.

19:33.230 --> 19:35.190
- Don't tell me this.
- I will tell you.

19:35.190 --> 19:37.140
Because I saw it.

19:37.140 --> 19:40.150
I know what happened to you
when you lost that nun killer.

19:40.150 --> 19:41.230
And I could see
what was happening

19:41.230 --> 19:43.070
when this case
started to go south,

19:43.070 --> 19:46.130
and I see you now.

19:46.130 --> 19:49.010
And I know
how this thing will play out.

19:49.010 --> 19:51.070
If you try him on felony murder,
he's gonna stand up

19:51.070 --> 19:53.010
and tell the real truth,

19:53.010 --> 19:55.030
which will be consistent
with his statement to the cops,

19:55.030 --> 19:57.050
and his testimony at the prelim.

19:57.050 --> 19:59.160
You will never
get past reasonable doubt,

19:59.160 --> 20:00.180
and you'll be stuck
going after him

20:00.180 --> 20:05.100
for perjury six months from now.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.060
Drop the felony murder.

20:07.060 --> 20:09.000
Let him cop to the perjury now.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.140
Then go to the gym
and hit the heavy bag.

20:10.140 --> 20:12.130
It's the only thing
you can really do.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.140
Helen?

20:22.040 --> 20:25.010
- I don't know
if I can do this anymore.

20:25.010 --> 20:27.160
- Do what?

20:27.160 --> 20:29.010
- This job.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.100
- Helen...

20:34.100 --> 20:36.140
This is just a couple
of fluke cases.

20:40.120 --> 20:43.170
Are you okay?

20:43.170 --> 20:46.140
- I'm fine.

20:46.140 --> 20:48.080
I'm fine.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.010
- Why did you schedule
an M and M conference

21:02.010 --> 21:04.120
the very night Mrs. Minor died?

21:04.120 --> 21:07.130
- Because, as I explained,
her death upset me.

21:07.130 --> 21:09.060
I wanted to make sure
we didn't cause it.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.020
- Did you?
- No.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.080
- That was the conclusion

21:12.080 --> 21:13.190
reached in the M
and M conference?

21:13.190 --> 21:15.170
- Objection.
Those meetings are sealed.

21:15.170 --> 21:17.010
Counsel is trying
to get the witness

21:17.010 --> 21:18.070
to waive the privilege of a--

21:18.070 --> 21:20.060
- If it's no, it's no.

21:20.060 --> 21:21.080
- I object to the trick.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.000
He knows
the meetings are secret.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.170
He's trying
to exploit the secrecy

21:24.170 --> 21:26.030
to make us look
like we're hiding something.

21:26.030 --> 21:27.130
- What, are you a fortune
teller now?

21:27.130 --> 21:28.140
- All right.

21:28.140 --> 21:30.060
Sustained.

21:30.060 --> 21:32.170
Mr. Donnell, continue.

21:32.170 --> 21:34.060
- You wanted the meeting
that night

21:34.060 --> 21:36.110
because you were urgent
to find out what happened.

21:36.110 --> 21:37.110
- Yes.

21:37.110 --> 21:38.200
- Did you recommend to Mr. Minor

21:38.200 --> 21:40.060
that you do an autopsy?

21:40.060 --> 21:41.170
- He didn't seem to want that.

21:41.170 --> 21:43.150
- My question is,
did you recommend it?

21:43.150 --> 21:45.110
- I don't think I did.

21:45.110 --> 21:48.070
- In fact, didn't you say
to Mr. Minor and his daughter

21:48.070 --> 21:50.090
"We can do an autopsy
if you want,

21:50.090 --> 21:51.120
but it won't bring her back."

21:51.120 --> 21:53.080
Weren't those your very words?

21:53.080 --> 21:55.010
- I don't remember,
but it's possible I said that.

21:55.010 --> 21:57.150
- Sounds almost like you were
discouraging an autopsy.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.020
- The blood work
revealed she died

21:59.020 --> 22:00.120
of a bacterial infection.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.220
- But you didn't know
that at the time

22:01.220 --> 22:03.200
you discouraged the autopsy.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.200
- I didn't discourage it.
I just didn't push for it.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.030
- You didn't push for it.

22:07.030 --> 22:08.150
That doesn't go
with this urgency

22:08.150 --> 22:10.060
to find out what happened.

22:10.060 --> 22:12.050
Was the urgency
to conceal what happened?

22:12.050 --> 22:13.110
- No, that isn't what happened.

22:13.110 --> 22:14.120
- Why was Dr. Morganson
so upset?

22:14.120 --> 22:16.020
Did he know Mrs. Minor?

22:16.020 --> 22:18.160
- He was upset because
another patient had died.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.040
And this news on top of that--

22:20.040 --> 22:21.090
- He knew something went wrong,
didn't he?

22:21.090 --> 22:22.230
- Objection!

22:22.230 --> 22:24.160
- Patients don't just
die from cheek implants,

22:24.160 --> 22:25.230
do they, Dr. Leach?

22:25.230 --> 22:27.040
- Objection!
- Something went wrong.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.150
- Mr. Donnell.

22:28.150 --> 22:29.190
- You say you want
to know what happened,

22:29.190 --> 22:31.030
but you don't urge an autopsy.

22:31.030 --> 22:33.010
There's a late night
secret meeting--

22:33.010 --> 22:35.060
- This is exactly
what I'm talking about!

22:35.060 --> 22:36.190
- Mr. Donnell, that's enough.

22:36.190 --> 22:39.110
- Is it your testimony
that you have no idea

22:39.110 --> 22:42.020
how she got
this fatal infection?

22:42.020 --> 22:45.180
- That's my testimony.

22:45.180 --> 22:48.100
- He pleads to perjury.
We go right to sentencing today.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.090
- I'd want to be heard.
- You can be heard, but--

22:50.090 --> 22:51.200
- And why rush it?
We might as well--

22:51.200 --> 22:53.140
- Well, do it now,
or there's no deal.

22:58.120 --> 23:01.080
It's just,
I want this to be over.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.220
And you should want it
to be over too.

23:03.220 --> 23:07.020
Because the longer
I live with it, the angrier I...

23:09.130 --> 23:12.010
There's an offer before you.
Take it or not.

23:15.010 --> 23:17.130
- And what would I get?
For perjury?

23:17.130 --> 23:19.120
- It's discretionary,
but I think

23:19.120 --> 23:21.150
I can make a pretty
decent argument to the judge.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.230
- And we have to decide today?

23:22.230 --> 23:24.070
- There is really
no decision, Gary.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.000
If we don't plead
to the perjury,

23:26.000 --> 23:27.220
then the felony murder charge
doesn't get dropped,

23:27.220 --> 23:29.150
and we can't risk that.

23:29.150 --> 23:31.090
They've got you dead
to right on perjury anyway,

23:31.090 --> 23:34.120
so there's no real reason
not to jump at this.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.180
- And why do the sentencing
today?

23:36.180 --> 23:37.230
- The D.A.
wants to put this behind her,

23:37.230 --> 23:39.160
and so do you.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.070
Now, there's a chance
we can get you out of here,

23:41.070 --> 23:43.170
so let's just do it.

23:47.210 --> 23:49.110
- Okay.

23:51.210 --> 23:53.050
- I fired several shots,

23:53.050 --> 23:54.200
at which point
he dropped the gun,

23:54.200 --> 23:56.100
and ran into the stairway.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.070
- The defendant.
- Yes.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.130
We then entered the stairway
on the lobby floor,

24:00.130 --> 24:01.120
met him coming down.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.000
He started going back up,

24:03.000 --> 24:04.230
but we caught him.

24:04.230 --> 24:06.190
- You say he started shooting
at you as soon

24:06.190 --> 24:08.190
as you entered the lobby.
- That's correct.

24:08.190 --> 24:09.190
- And you immediately returned
fire.

24:09.190 --> 24:10.190
- Yes.

24:10.190 --> 24:11.230
- At which point, he dropped the

24:11.230 --> 24:13.020
gun and ran into the stairwell.

24:13.020 --> 24:15.000
- Yes.
- Any prints on the gun?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.100
- None that were usable.

24:16.100 --> 24:18.040
- The look you got
of him on the balcony,

24:18.040 --> 24:19.160
that was three, four seconds?

24:19.160 --> 24:21.050
- I suppose that's about right.

24:21.050 --> 24:23.230
- With a gun barrel
pointed in your direction.

24:23.230 --> 24:25.050
- Yes.

24:25.050 --> 24:27.030
- And the stairway
was behind him;

24:27.030 --> 24:28.030
is that not right?

24:28.030 --> 24:29.170
- Yes.

24:29.170 --> 24:32.020
- So he turned and ran
with his back toward you.

24:32.020 --> 24:33.200
- I suppose.
- You suppose?

24:33.200 --> 24:36.020
Did he backpedal,
or did he turn and run?

24:36.020 --> 24:37.150
- He turned and ran.

24:37.150 --> 24:39.080
- And how were the lights
up there on the balcony?

24:39.080 --> 24:40.180
- We got a good look at him.

24:40.180 --> 24:42.000
- It was dark, wasn't it?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.190
- We saw his face.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.220
- You say "we" like you're
speaking for Officer Gibson.

24:45.220 --> 24:47.070
Did you two go
over your testimony?

24:47.070 --> 24:49.030
- Objection.
- Sustained.

24:49.030 --> 24:50.090
- You said
in your statement there

24:50.090 --> 24:51.230
may have been others
on the balcony,

24:51.230 --> 24:53.030
but it was too dark to tell.

24:53.030 --> 24:54.110
Was that your statement?

24:54.110 --> 24:55.200
- Yes.
But we got a good look at him.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.190
[muffled yelling]

24:57.190 --> 25:00.080
- If you don't settle down,
Mr. Little, I'll remove you.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.150
Don't think I won't have
you hauled right out of here.

25:14.210 --> 25:16.040
- Mr. Stanton.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.000
I'm Bobby Donnell.
I called.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.220
Our information shows

25:21.220 --> 25:23.150
that your daughter
died on the same day.

25:23.150 --> 25:25.010
There's been testimony

25:25.010 --> 25:27.050
that the chief of staff
was very upset about it.

25:27.050 --> 25:29.060
I'm not entitled
to see her medical records

25:29.060 --> 25:31.020
without your permission.

25:31.020 --> 25:33.160
- And what does Carol's death
have to do with your case?

25:33.160 --> 25:35.060
- Well, maybe nothing,

25:35.060 --> 25:37.080
but that's what I'd
like to find out.

25:37.080 --> 25:40.070
- I'd like you to please leave,
sir.

25:40.070 --> 25:42.120
- Mr. Stanton,
a woman died here, I just--

25:42.120 --> 25:44.080
- A woman died?

25:44.080 --> 25:45.090
That's why you're here,
you're concerned

25:45.090 --> 25:47.230
about a woman's death?

25:47.230 --> 25:51.030
My daughter died, Mr. Donnell.

25:51.030 --> 25:53.090
We're finally at a point
where our lives have resumed,

25:53.090 --> 25:54.210
and you happily come along
to dig it all up,

25:54.210 --> 25:56.110
because of your deep concern
over some--

25:56.110 --> 25:59.030
- Darrell--
- No, he's here about money.

25:59.030 --> 26:03.080
You think twice about whether
we want this kind of visit?

26:03.080 --> 26:04.190
Our daughter was 19.

26:04.190 --> 26:06.180
- I'm just trying
to represent some people

26:06.180 --> 26:08.160
with a claim
against the hospital.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.200
- Darrell!

26:10.200 --> 26:12.020
I'm so sorry.

26:19.060 --> 26:21.200
Carol's death was devastating.

26:21.200 --> 26:25.120
She was our only child, and...

26:25.120 --> 26:28.170
The idea
of reliving her death...

26:28.170 --> 26:31.010
He always...

26:31.010 --> 26:33.020
It was just so...

26:33.020 --> 26:36.100
- How did she die?

26:36.100 --> 26:39.050
- She went in for minor surgery

26:39.050 --> 26:42.020
and got some post-op infection.

26:45.180 --> 26:47.000
- I want to find out
how many people

26:47.000 --> 26:48.060
died in that hospital

26:48.060 --> 26:49.220
a week before
and a week after.

26:49.220 --> 26:52.070
Get the names--
Just listen, Lucy.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.010
Get the names,
and have Jimmy, Lindsay,

26:54.010 --> 26:56.220
and Eugene contact the families
and find out how they died.

26:56.220 --> 27:00.140
And this has to be done now.

27:00.140 --> 27:04.010
- Rebecca.

27:04.010 --> 27:05.180
We may have a little bump here.

27:05.180 --> 27:07.080
- What do you mean "bump?"

27:07.080 --> 27:09.040
- There was an internal
police investigation

27:09.040 --> 27:10.150
regarding the shooting.

27:10.150 --> 27:12.090
I just found out about it,
I promise you.

27:12.090 --> 27:13.160
Here's the report.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.070
- The shooting
surrounding this arrest?

27:15.070 --> 27:17.020
- Yes.

27:17.020 --> 27:19.190
Officer Helms evidently once
claimed he wounded the suspect

27:19.190 --> 27:20.220
on the balcony.

27:20.220 --> 27:22.040
Now, he's since backed off it,

27:22.040 --> 27:24.140
but blood was found
on the balcony.

27:24.140 --> 27:27.060
The sample was lost.

27:27.060 --> 27:30.050
- Excuse me, "lost"?

27:30.050 --> 27:32.190
- I don't know what to say.

27:32.190 --> 27:36.060
If you want to move
for a mistrial, I won't oppose.

27:39.130 --> 27:41.110
- We're not having any mistrial.
- What?

27:41.110 --> 27:42.210
- We're late into it, I don't--

27:42.210 --> 27:44.050
- If the man
on the balcony was wounded,

27:44.050 --> 27:45.190
then that clears Byron Little.

27:45.190 --> 27:47.030
- The officer said he was wrong
about wounding him.

27:47.030 --> 27:48.210
- Oh, come on.

27:48.210 --> 27:50.120
- You expect me to throw out
an entire trial, because--

27:50.120 --> 27:52.010
- First of all, the State
has a duty

27:52.010 --> 27:53.220
to turn over
all exculpatory evidence.

27:53.220 --> 27:55.110
I'm just getting
this report now.

27:55.110 --> 27:57.160
- He just got it.
- Second, this is material.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.020
This completely affects
how I would've

27:59.020 --> 28:00.020
cross-examined Officer Helms.

28:00.020 --> 28:01.130
- You can recall him.

28:01.130 --> 28:02.220
- And they say
they lost the blood sample.

28:02.220 --> 28:04.050
I need time to investigate.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.080
- Look, Counsel,
they caught your man

28:05.080 --> 28:07.030
running down the stairway.

28:07.030 --> 28:09.110
- But he's been saying he wasn't
the man on the balcony,

28:09.110 --> 28:11.170
and that blood may prove it.
- How?

28:11.170 --> 28:14.010
The officer claims he did not
wound the suspect.

28:14.010 --> 28:15.210
That means the blood
is irrelevant.

28:15.210 --> 28:17.090
I'm not throwing out this trial.

28:17.090 --> 28:19.210
- You can't be serious.
- Look, young lady.

28:19.210 --> 28:21.060
You may be used
to having your clients

28:21.060 --> 28:23.200
freed on stunts
and technicalities,

28:23.200 --> 28:25.100
but not in my court.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.160
- They withheld
material evidence.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.060
- The trial goes on.

28:29.060 --> 28:31.150
You can recall the officer
and recross him.

28:31.150 --> 28:32.190
That's all.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.030
- Did he lie under oath?

28:40.030 --> 28:41.200
Yes.

28:41.200 --> 28:44.040
Are there
mitigating circumstances?

28:44.040 --> 28:45.140
Of course there are.

28:45.140 --> 28:48.100
His mother was murdered.

28:48.100 --> 28:51.210
He was turned into the star
witness against his father,

28:51.210 --> 28:55.020
a father who he had
an estranged relationship with.

28:55.020 --> 28:56.200
A father,
as you can see

28:56.200 --> 29:00.170
by the psychiatric reports,
Gary lived for his approval

29:00.170 --> 29:02.070
and rarely got it.

29:02.070 --> 29:03.100
Here he is,

29:03.100 --> 29:05.180
a kid with a drug history,

29:05.180 --> 29:07.190
emotionally unstable,

29:07.190 --> 29:10.090
being asked
to put his dad

29:10.090 --> 29:12.160
away for life.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.000
He couldn't do it.

29:15.150 --> 29:18.090
He couldn't do it.

29:18.090 --> 29:21.120
The law insulates us from having
to testify against a spouse.

29:21.120 --> 29:24.010
Well, a son's connection
with a father

29:24.010 --> 29:26.080
can be just as powerful.

29:29.020 --> 29:32.220
Gary Armbrust isn't a bad kid,
Your Honor.

29:32.220 --> 29:35.200
We all know that.

29:35.200 --> 29:38.170
He just couldn't go through
with sending his dad to prison.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.040
- Yes.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.160
The law does protect spouses

29:53.160 --> 29:56.030
from giving testimony
against each other.

29:56.030 --> 29:59.070
But there's no such immunity
when it comes to father and son,

29:59.070 --> 30:01.230
and they don't get
to just make up a law

30:01.230 --> 30:05.170
because in their minds the love
is just as powerful.

30:05.170 --> 30:09.220
What's at stake here is
the integrity of this process.

30:09.220 --> 30:11.160
He committed perjury.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.110
He lied under oath,

30:13.110 --> 30:15.040
and if we tolerate it,

30:15.040 --> 30:18.230
we have to consider
the worst-case scenario.

30:18.230 --> 30:21.090
The day may come
where witnesses lie to help

30:21.090 --> 30:24.090
free premeditated murderers.

30:24.090 --> 30:26.010
This case--

30:26.010 --> 30:28.220
this case is the worst-case
scenario.

30:28.220 --> 30:30.180
A murderer is walking free

30:30.180 --> 30:33.220
because the defendant
committed perjury.

30:33.220 --> 30:36.060
Your Honor, you and I--

30:36.060 --> 30:38.090
you and I walk
into this courtroom

30:38.090 --> 30:40.100
every day without clients.

30:40.100 --> 30:44.030
In essence,
we work for the room.

30:44.030 --> 30:46.220
What he did to this room,

30:46.220 --> 30:50.110
and technicalities
and fourth amendments,

30:50.110 --> 30:53.150
he killed her
and stuffed her in a closet.

30:53.150 --> 30:55.130
He killed a nun, he--

31:00.090 --> 31:02.030
- Helen?

31:06.140 --> 31:08.180
- I'm sorry.

31:08.180 --> 31:10.150
He...

31:10.150 --> 31:11.190
He lied.

31:13.230 --> 31:16.020
We work for the room,
Your Honor.

31:19.010 --> 31:20.120
We work for the room.

31:38.220 --> 31:40.060
- I did say once
that I thought I wounded him,

31:40.060 --> 31:41.220
but I was wrong.

31:41.220 --> 31:43.210
- And what suddenly
convinced you you were wrong?

31:43.210 --> 31:45.020
- When we caught him,
he wasn't wounded,

31:45.020 --> 31:46.160
so I obviously was wrong.

31:46.160 --> 31:49.200
- Or maybe the man you shot at,
the man shooting at you,

31:49.200 --> 31:52.090
was not the same man
you chased in the stairwell.

31:52.090 --> 31:54.110
- No, it was him.
I saw his face.

31:54.110 --> 31:56.080
- Hm. And what about the blood
that was found?

31:56.080 --> 31:58.090
- That was old, dried blood.
- In this report--

31:58.090 --> 31:59.220
- I first thought it was fresh,

31:59.220 --> 32:01.180
'cause in my excitement,
I thought I wounded him,

32:01.180 --> 32:04.000
but it was old dried blood
that had been there.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.170
- And did you test this blood
to determine--

32:05.170 --> 32:07.120
- Objection; relevance.
- Sustained.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.080
- Your Honor, he testified there
were others in the balcony--

32:09.080 --> 32:11.060
- The jury will disregard
any mention of blood--

32:11.060 --> 32:13.070
It has no relevance whatsoever.

32:13.070 --> 32:15.230
Counsel, step up!

32:15.230 --> 32:18.050
- Those blood samples
could exonerate my client.

32:18.050 --> 32:19.190
He can't know
it's old blood,

32:19.190 --> 32:21.140
and the fact that those samples
were somehow lost--

32:21.140 --> 32:23.190
- There will be no mention
of blood.

32:23.190 --> 32:25.050
It's not relevant.

32:25.050 --> 32:26.220
And if you mention the police
losing it,

32:26.220 --> 32:28.100
you buy yourself a jail cell.

32:28.100 --> 32:29.150
- I am just trying--

32:29.150 --> 32:31.050
- This trial will not be
prevented

32:31.050 --> 32:33.190
by sleazy defense lawyering.

32:33.190 --> 32:36.000
I've had about enough
of you already, damn it.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.060
- You need to take
some time off.

32:44.060 --> 32:46.050
- Yeah.

32:46.050 --> 32:49.070
I'm not losing my mind,
Lindsay, I...

32:49.070 --> 32:51.060
- You just mixed up defendants.

32:51.060 --> 32:53.040
You called the perjurer
a nun-killer, Helen.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.020
I'm worried about you.

32:55.020 --> 32:57.110
You've had this look
in your eye lately,

32:57.110 --> 33:01.010
and your voice, and...

33:01.010 --> 33:03.060
Will they give you
some time off?

33:03.060 --> 33:07.190
- I think so.

33:07.190 --> 33:10.180
It's just not fair anymore.

33:10.180 --> 33:14.150
- What's not fair?
Tell me what's not fair.

33:14.150 --> 33:18.020
- My sister has a radio.

33:18.020 --> 33:20.080
- Your sister has a radio?

33:20.080 --> 33:25.060
- She has a nice job
at an insurance company.

33:25.060 --> 33:28.030
She gets to sit at a desk,

33:28.030 --> 33:30.020
and she plays her radio.

33:33.180 --> 33:36.010
She can hear music
during the day.

33:40.110 --> 33:43.210
Just once, I'd like to turn up
the radio in that room.

33:48.050 --> 33:50.070
And sing the bad days away.

33:52.110 --> 33:54.040
Sing away.

33:59.190 --> 34:04.000
- If I have to take you
on vacation myself, I will.

34:06.070 --> 34:08.150
You definitely
need some time off.

34:16.090 --> 34:18.210
- Four patients in three days?

34:18.210 --> 34:22.120
All routine surgeries, all dead
from streptococcus sepsis.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.219
Your hospital had a bacteria.

34:23.219 --> 34:26.139
- Four cases
does not constitute an outbreak.

34:26.139 --> 34:28.010
- All the same strain?

34:28.010 --> 34:29.170
In three days,
and you don't tell him?

34:29.170 --> 34:31.230
He asked what happened,
you just leave that out?

34:31.230 --> 34:33.179
- The other patients
have privacy rights.

34:33.179 --> 34:35.130
I just can't reveal
their case history.

34:35.130 --> 34:37.110
- Is that what you're gonna say
when I recall you?

34:37.110 --> 34:39.199
$7 million today,

34:39.199 --> 34:41.139
or I notify the health marshal.

34:41.139 --> 34:43.219
- That kind of threat could get
you a trip to the overseers.

34:43.219 --> 34:45.199
- I'll risk it!

34:45.199 --> 34:47.060
I'm tempted
to call the district attorney.

34:47.060 --> 34:49.110
This borders
on corporate murder.

34:49.110 --> 34:52.020
You had a lethal strain
of bacteria killing patients,

34:52.020 --> 34:53.199
and you sat on it?

34:53.199 --> 34:56.020
The health marshal might close
your doors to investigate.

34:56.020 --> 34:58.210
At 300,000 a day, that'll run
you 2 to 3 million,

34:58.210 --> 35:00.060
and that's just in actuals.

35:00.060 --> 35:02.010
The long-term
damage could be worse.

35:02.010 --> 35:03.090
That's probably why you
concealed

35:03.090 --> 35:05.000
the outbreak
in the first place.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.200
You were afraid the health
marshal would move in.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.210
You'll pay the seven today,
and be grateful,

35:08.210 --> 35:10.200
and I don't care
how you split your policies.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.170
- You still
haven't established negligence

35:12.170 --> 35:13.230
as to her cause
of death, and I--

35:13.230 --> 35:15.160
- I can establish a cover-up,

35:15.160 --> 35:19.190
and that's all I'll need,
and we all know it.

35:19.190 --> 35:22.070
- I ask you what happened,
and you look me in the eye

35:22.070 --> 35:24.060
and say, "I don't know"?

35:26.110 --> 35:28.210
You look me right in the eye.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.210
- Because of him, Arnold.

35:30.210 --> 35:34.050
We get sued for everything
because of lawyers like him.

35:34.050 --> 35:35.180
Every patient
that comes through the door,

35:35.180 --> 35:38.060
we have to look at
as a potential plaintiff.

35:42.150 --> 35:46.140
There was nothing I could say
after that could bring her back.

35:46.140 --> 35:49.090
- So why even volunteer
the truth?

35:49.090 --> 35:51.040
- Yeah, sometimes we lie,
Mr. Donnell.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.090
- Milton--
- I'm talking in general.

35:53.090 --> 35:56.170
Lawsuits have driven the truth
underground, Mr. Donnell.

35:56.170 --> 35:59.010
- Well, this one dug it up.

35:59.010 --> 36:01.070
Didn't it?

36:01.070 --> 36:03.090
- I'll have to discuss
all of this with the board

36:03.090 --> 36:04.140
before I get back to you.

36:04.140 --> 36:05.230
- You're authorized to settle.

36:05.230 --> 36:07.070
- Not at that amount.

36:07.070 --> 36:08.200
- Well, then go talk to them.

36:23.100 --> 36:27.040
- I thought he was a good man.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.170
- He probably is.

36:29.170 --> 36:31.110
That's what's so sad about it.

36:45.020 --> 36:46.220
- How did it happen

36:46.220 --> 36:49.230
that we can't trust the police?

36:49.230 --> 36:54.010
I mean, this is an institution
that's supposed to protect us.

36:54.010 --> 36:57.170
I don't doubt these officers
think Byron Little is the guy.

36:57.170 --> 36:59.120
They tackled him
in the stairwell

36:59.120 --> 37:01.140
after they saw the man
on the balcony run

37:01.140 --> 37:02.190
into the stairwell.

37:02.190 --> 37:04.060
It's completely reasonable

37:04.060 --> 37:07.020
to believe it must be
the same guy.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.210
Hey, I did.

37:08.210 --> 37:11.090
I mean, one look at him.

37:11.090 --> 37:15.020
He looks like your typical
urban criminal.

37:15.020 --> 37:16.190
He acts violent,

37:16.190 --> 37:18.200
and we all know
our honorable Your Honor

37:18.200 --> 37:20.220
thinks he's the guy too.

37:20.220 --> 37:24.140
But mistakes and cover-ups,

37:24.140 --> 37:27.220
those are
two very different things.

37:27.220 --> 37:28.220
One
of the officers

37:28.220 --> 37:31.060
said he wounded the suspect.

37:31.060 --> 37:33.140
Blood was even found
on the balcony,

37:33.140 --> 37:34.210
though it's been
deemed irrelevant

37:34.210 --> 37:36.040
for the sake of this trial,

37:36.040 --> 37:38.050
but when they examined
Mr. Little back

37:38.050 --> 37:42.050
at the police station,
they found no wound.

37:42.050 --> 37:46.140
And suddenly,
the officer amends his account

37:46.140 --> 37:48.200
and says he must have missed.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.120
And they march into this court

37:50.120 --> 37:55.140
and positively identify him
as the shooter.

37:55.140 --> 37:59.110
They see him 30 feet above,

37:59.110 --> 38:01.030
on a darkened balcony,

38:01.030 --> 38:03.040
for three seconds tops,

38:03.040 --> 38:05.060
all the while being shot at,

38:05.060 --> 38:08.010
and yet, they're positive.

38:08.010 --> 38:11.110
Not "It looked like him," not
"It was probably him."

38:11.110 --> 38:14.080
"Definitely him."

38:14.080 --> 38:16.090
How can that be?

38:16.090 --> 38:18.200
And why start hiding
internal reports

38:18.200 --> 38:20.010
from the defense lawyers?

38:20.010 --> 38:22.060
Why forget to mention the blood?

38:22.060 --> 38:24.130
Why come in
with all this absolute,

38:24.130 --> 38:26.210
positive eyewitness accounts?

38:26.210 --> 38:29.030
Why forget to tell us,
"Oh, yeah,

38:29.030 --> 38:31.130
"one of our officers
who was so positive,

38:31.130 --> 38:34.060
wasn't so positive
before he changed his mind"?

38:34.060 --> 38:38.150
Why not just be upfront
with what you got?

38:38.150 --> 38:40.200
Why?

38:40.200 --> 38:44.230
Because without all
that absolute positive stuff,

38:44.230 --> 38:46.170
they lose him.

38:46.170 --> 38:51.000
They lose the guy
they think did it.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.010
And let's be fair.

38:53.010 --> 38:56.060
They lose so many.

38:56.060 --> 38:58.170
And I know it turns stomachs.

38:58.170 --> 39:01.180
It's turned our honorable
Your Honor's stomach so,

39:01.180 --> 39:06.070
he thinks nothing now of taping
criminal defendant mouths

39:06.070 --> 39:08.170
shut, handcuffing them,

39:08.170 --> 39:11.010
making them look guilty.

39:11.010 --> 39:13.070
Hey, it's his court.

39:13.070 --> 39:15.100
He's old;
he's probably had enough,

39:15.100 --> 39:18.010
and he doesn't care.

39:18.010 --> 39:22.040
But the thing about juries,
it tends to be their one

39:22.040 --> 39:24.040
and only time
serving this process,

39:24.040 --> 39:25.230
so they tend
to take it seriously.

39:25.230 --> 39:29.020
And not just rush through it
with a bunch of assumptions.

39:29.020 --> 39:31.190
And therein lies
Byron Little's only hope.

39:31.190 --> 39:33.160
It's not with the police.

39:33.160 --> 39:37.050
It's not with our honorable
Your Honor.

39:37.050 --> 39:40.000
It's with you.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.110
You have two choices here.

39:42.110 --> 39:43.210
You can hold up
the oath

39:43.210 --> 39:47.210
you took at the beginning
of all this...

39:47.210 --> 39:50.080
or not.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.150
Maybe guys like this...

39:55.170 --> 39:57.070
We're not supposed to care.

40:15.120 --> 40:21.120
- Two eyewitnesses
saw him shoot the gun.

40:21.120 --> 40:25.130
Saw him run into the stairwell.

40:25.130 --> 40:29.060
They pursued him
into the stairwell

40:29.060 --> 40:32.200
and caught him.

40:32.200 --> 40:35.200
Sometimes we just want things
to be all juicy

40:35.200 --> 40:39.150
and complicated
when they're not.

40:52.160 --> 40:56.210
- I am mindful
of how difficult it must be

40:56.210 --> 41:00.230
to be faced with testifying
against one's own father.

41:00.230 --> 41:02.060
Especially
when that testimony

41:02.060 --> 41:04.170
could result
in life imprisonment.

41:04.170 --> 41:08.230
But I am also mindful
of the Court's need

41:08.230 --> 41:14.110
to assure the integrity of
this criminal justice process.

41:14.110 --> 41:16.060
Perjury is to be taken very,

41:16.060 --> 41:19.000
very seriously.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.220
I know you know this.

41:20.220 --> 41:24.110
I know you were apprised
of the risks.

41:24.110 --> 41:28.080
Nevertheless,
you chose to assume those risks.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.230
In fact, given these warnings,

41:30.230 --> 41:37.140
your commission of perjury
was particularly knowing.

41:37.140 --> 41:41.020
I sentence you to 20 years
at Cedar Junction,

41:41.020 --> 41:42.150
a sentence to begin immediately.

41:42.150 --> 41:45.170
Bailiff, we're adjourned.
- We'll appeal.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.000
- Ellenor...

41:47.000 --> 41:48.190
- Gary,
I want you to hang in there.

41:48.190 --> 41:51.100
We're going to appeal.
We're going to appeal.

42:12.020 --> 42:13.050
- How'd it go?

42:13.050 --> 42:14.090
- Not good.

42:34.040 --> 42:38.230
- Tell me.

42:38.230 --> 42:41.120
- He's just a kid.

42:41.120 --> 42:43.130
He got afraid
at the last second, and he--

42:43.130 --> 42:47.000
He didn't want to hurt his dad.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
- What'd he get?

42:50.000 --> 42:51.120
- Maximum.

42:51.120 --> 42:53.160
20 years.

42:53.160 --> 42:55.090
God, Eugene, what have I done?

42:55.090 --> 42:56.190
- Hey.

42:56.190 --> 42:58.060
This isn't on you, Ellenor.

42:58.060 --> 42:59.210
- If I would have come down
on him harder,

42:59.210 --> 43:01.190
if I would have just
anticipated a felony murder--

43:01.190 --> 43:05.020
- This isn't
on you.

43:09.020 --> 43:12.230
- He's going away for 20 years.

43:21.130 --> 43:23.190
- Will the defendant
please rise.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.180
Has the jury
reached a unanimous verdict?

43:28.180 --> 43:31.130
- We have.
- What say you?

43:31.130 --> 43:33.120
- On the matter
of the Commonwealth versus

43:33.120 --> 43:34.210
Byron Little,

43:34.210 --> 43:37.060
on the charge
of attempted murder,

43:37.060 --> 43:40.040
we find the defendant

43:40.040 --> 43:41.170
not guilty.

43:43.130 --> 43:45.000
- Unlock him.
Let him go.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.070
Jury's free.
We're adjourned.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.140
- You're welcome.
