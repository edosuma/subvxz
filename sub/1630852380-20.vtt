WEBVTT

00:12.012 --> 00:15.348
[Blake] There's no proof
heart arrhythmias are a side effect.

00:15.432 --> 00:18.893
These claims against my son
are false and defamatory.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.438
That's why I had no problem
putting up his bond.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.940
Justice will prevail.

00:25.358 --> 00:29.362
-I can't believe how reckless you were.
-If Mother hadn't turned me in,

00:29.446 --> 00:32.407
-none of this would be happening.
-This isn't your mother's fault.

00:32.490 --> 00:35.410
You decided to import
and use illegal ingredients.

00:35.493 --> 00:38.413
Ingredient. Technically, it was just one.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.624
-[sighs]
-Sorry, but I can't change the past.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.542
No, you can't.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.253
We need to make this go away
and start fresh.

00:45.336 --> 00:48.757
-Great. Forward motion. Where do we begin?
-How about with the seven civil suits

00:48.840 --> 00:50.967
against you,
then we'll move on to the criminal case?

00:51.050 --> 00:54.053
Thank you.
I don't know where I'd be without you.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.180
In jail.

00:55.263 --> 00:56.681
You mind if I wear this?

00:56.765 --> 00:58.516
Um, you already are.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.226
Good point. [chuckles]

01:01.144 --> 01:04.522
Besides being super brilliant,
supportive and gorgeous,

01:04.606 --> 01:08.234
I love being your girlfriend
because I've doubled my wardrobe options.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.195
-What's on your docket?
-I'm volunteering

01:10.278 --> 01:13.531
-for Jeff's ColbyCo Day of Caring.
-Really?

01:13.615 --> 01:16.367
-When did you become so philanthropic?
-I've been feeling guilty.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.037
I feel like I dropped the ball
on my recovery program.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.499
You have been sober for over a year.
That is a huge deal.

01:22.582 --> 01:25.376
-You should be proud.
-I am. But the court case

01:25.460 --> 01:27.629
and fiasco with my father's book
made me realize

01:27.712 --> 01:30.131
I need to be committed to rigorous honesty
and acts of service.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.382
Jeff's been a good friend.

01:31.466 --> 01:35.261
I figure I can repay him
and do good deeds in the process.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.139
-You've got it figured out.
-Why don't you come?

01:38.223 --> 01:41.142
You know what they say: Couples
who volunteer together stay together.

01:41.226 --> 01:45.438
Okay. I don't think anybody says that.
I already work at the hospital.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.357
Plus, I gotta go to Alexis'.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.819
Hmm. I didn't realize
you two were on speaking terms.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.154
We're not. She's begging Fallon and I

01:53.238 --> 01:57.200
to go and have breakfast
and talk to her, so we're going. Yay.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.119
Mm. Uh-- [clears throat]

01:59.661 --> 02:03.456
Before you go, I need to practice
some rigorous honesty with you.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.874
Why do I have a bad feeling?

02:04.958 --> 02:08.711
You know your diamond necklace I wore
when you were in London?

02:09.337 --> 02:13.007
The clasp broke, and they don't know
if they can fix it. Sorry.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.761
-Ooh! Wow. That felt good.
-As long as it felt good

02:16.845 --> 02:19.597
for one of us. Okay. Bye.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.977
There's my girls. Thank you for coming.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.062
I know we're not in the best place
right now, but--

02:26.146 --> 02:30.024
Eh. I'm still not in a hugging mood.
Between blowing off my charity event

02:30.108 --> 02:32.402
and lying in court
to jeopardize my child's legacy,

02:32.485 --> 02:34.821
-you are not my favorite person.
-I get that.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.782
But how would it have looked
if I was bidding on eligible bachelors

02:37.866 --> 02:41.161
-so soon into my third marriage?
-Like you weren't so selfish?

02:41.244 --> 02:44.372
-[sighs] And you?
-Uh, since the moment I arrived,

02:44.455 --> 02:46.916
all you cared about
was beating Blake for my attention.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.878
You also stole the book of secrets
from my girlfriend's bedroom.

02:49.961 --> 02:53.506
A girlfriend you barely acknowledge,
except to say you loathe her. So, yeah,

02:54.007 --> 02:56.801
-no hugs here either.
-"Loathe" is a bit severe,

02:56.885 --> 03:00.889
but that is why I wanted you both
to come over, so we could fix us.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.641
I'm tired of unhealthy,
toxic relationships.

03:03.725 --> 03:07.020
Oh. And who is the common denominator
in all that toxicity?

03:07.103 --> 03:10.064
Don't confuse me with math.
I'm apologizing.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.860
Apologies are useless.
You're like the girl who cried "sorry."

03:13.943 --> 03:16.779
And you can't help it.
A woman so self-absorbed

03:16.863 --> 03:21.367
-can only see the errors in others.
-Hmm. Would someone so self-absorbed

03:21.451 --> 03:25.079
bring masseuses all the way
from Sweden just for you?

03:25.163 --> 03:28.750
You think that'll massage away
all the pain you've caused us?

03:28.833 --> 03:32.670
I don't have time for this.
That drug you've been peddling on FSN

03:32.754 --> 03:35.798
has caused me problems
both legally and financially.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.218
You did not take
a bigger financial hit than I did.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.764
That illegal drug was on Adam.
That's why I turned him in.

03:44.390 --> 03:48.144
Wait a minute. Does this mean
there's not going to be a brunch?

03:48.228 --> 03:51.981
-Nobody wants a massage on a full stomach.
-We're done. Goodbye.

03:52.065 --> 03:52.899
Wait. No.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.442
Fallon.

03:54.525 --> 03:55.735
Amanda. Ah--

03:55.818 --> 03:58.238
-[elevator doors open, then close]
-[sighs]

03:58.321 --> 04:02.242
-Are you okay?
-No. I've already lost my sons.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.828
-I can't lose my daughters too.
-Stop punishing yourself.

04:06.454 --> 04:09.082
You've done your best.
This is their problem.

04:09.582 --> 04:13.836
-Can't force them to see you differently.
-You're so cute when you're wrong.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.339
Because that is exactly
what I'm going to do.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.758
Right. That's what I meant.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.470
This place is packed.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.597
These jalapeño chicken poppers
are killing it.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.182
[Ryan] Shoot. Sorry.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.559
-Sam.
-Ryan.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.981
-What are you doing here?
-I'm just here with some buddies.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.024
Um, are you gonna eat that

04:35.108 --> 04:37.235
-or just dangle it there awkwardly?
-Oh.

04:37.318 --> 04:41.406
Sorry. I didn't wanna get jalapeño grease
on your sexy--

04:41.489 --> 04:44.993
Um, your, uh, silk shirt. Come here.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.161
Thank you. Much appreciated.

04:48.246 --> 04:53.293
So are those guys in law school with you,
or, um, are they strippers too or...?

04:53.376 --> 04:54.877
-[Ryan chuckles]
-Or both?

04:54.961 --> 04:58.172
They are law-school friends
who picked this spot

04:58.256 --> 05:01.009
to blow off steam before finals.

05:01.092 --> 05:04.345
Of all the gin joints in Atlanta,
they had to pick La Mirage, huh?

05:04.429 --> 05:05.972
Yeah. They like the decor.

05:06.723 --> 05:12.937
But maybe you convinced them
to come for some other... spicy reasons.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.648
Come on, Sam, you know why.

05:17.650 --> 05:22.488
There are, you know,
extras here that they like.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.867
-You talking about the tuna melt?
-I'm talking about the high-end escorts

05:25.950 --> 05:28.578
-using La Mirage as home base.
-High-end who?

05:28.661 --> 05:30.663
-Escorts.
-Shh.

05:30.747 --> 05:34.042
Please do not scream out the word.
Are you being serious,

05:34.125 --> 05:36.961
or is this
some law-school initiation prank?

05:37.045 --> 05:40.840
-You seriously didn't know?
-No, I didn't know. I've been busy.

05:40.923 --> 05:44.802
Okay, well, according to my buddies,
at least half a dozen

05:44.886 --> 05:47.972
have been working out of here
for the last few weeks. Yeah. I just--

05:48.056 --> 05:50.892
You know,
I figured you were just taking a cut.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.811
-I'm not a pimp.
-Sex work is only an issue

05:53.895 --> 05:56.731
if it isn't entered into
with mutual respect for both parties.

05:56.814 --> 06:01.778
Well, you should really study up
on Georgia Code 16-6-9 for your final.

06:01.861 --> 06:02.695
All right?

06:03.196 --> 06:07.241
Prostitution is against the law.
I don't need that kind of trouble.

06:07.325 --> 06:12.288
This place is already family-friendly,
pet-friendly, LGBTQ-friendly.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.749
It can't also be escort-friendly.

06:17.877 --> 06:22.840
Ah. A sister spa day
is just what the knots in my back ordered.

06:22.924 --> 06:26.302
I know. I couldn't say it to Alexis,
but I actually could use a massage.

06:26.385 --> 06:29.847
Hmm. Thank you for setting this up.
You went all out with the ride.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.432
Me? I didn't set this up.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.936
Jeanette told me to meet you here
so we could go to the spa.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.188
That's exactly what she told me.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.190
[both] Alexis.

06:39.273 --> 06:42.860
-No, no, no.
-Oh, I see Jeanette did her job perfectly.

06:43.778 --> 06:46.030
-Ahh. Hans.
-[locks click]

06:46.114 --> 06:47.657
Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

06:47.740 --> 06:51.828
-Hey, unlock these doors, please.
-No, no. It is time for a road trip.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.539
-Road trip?
-This isn't funny.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.290
No, it's actually quite serious.

06:56.374 --> 06:59.252
Because if you're gonna continue
to see me as selfish and uncaring

06:59.335 --> 07:02.713
towards my children,
I'll have to show how wrong you are.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.632
By torturing us?

07:04.715 --> 07:07.510
No. A little light kidnapping.
Buckle up. Safety first.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.678
[door handle rattles]

07:10.096 --> 07:12.306
[theme music playing]

07:32.910 --> 07:35.496
[Kirby] Blood drive is on the left,
bake sale's on the right,

07:35.580 --> 07:38.749
and the ice-cream delivery
was meant to be for patients only.

07:38.833 --> 07:39.750
[chuckles]

07:40.126 --> 07:42.086
-Oh. Here you go.
-[Jeff clears throat]

07:43.254 --> 07:46.340
And you get a lollipop
for donating blood so bravely.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.177
Gemma, this is Kirby,

07:49.260 --> 07:52.472
who seems to have taken over
running this event for me.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.600
You're doing a great job.
Also, I love your bangs.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.560
This one's a keeper.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.562
-[Jeff] Mm.
-[cell phone buzzing]

07:59.645 --> 08:02.273
[Gemma] Sorry. It's the office.
I should get to work.

08:02.356 --> 08:06.736
-Text later to make plans?
-Yeah. Definitely. Have a great day.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.073
That Gemma is a gem.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.744
You think? We met
at a bachelor auction, of all places.

08:14.827 --> 08:15.870
She seems great.

08:15.953 --> 08:19.123
I'm on a kick to be rigorously honest,
so I'm telling the truth.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.251
What you're doing
for this neuro ward is amazing.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.587
It's a start.
There's things I could've been doing

08:24.670 --> 08:27.465
if I hadn't been chasing my companies
for the last six months.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.511
[tense music playing]

08:31.594 --> 08:33.387
Uh, are you okay?

08:34.138 --> 08:38.059
What? Yeah. Totally. I just, uh--
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

08:38.142 --> 08:41.854
-You're all good now, right?
-Sure. I just wasted a lot of time.

08:42.396 --> 08:46.943
I wanna sponsor future tech innovators
at HBCUs so they can start their ColbyCos

08:47.026 --> 08:49.070
around the globe,
but I missed the whole year.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.697
Even if you had known,
it's only been six months.

08:51.781 --> 08:55.660
Well, bureaucracy takes time.
I can't even convince the head nurse

08:55.743 --> 08:58.412
to let me throw a garden party
for nurses and patients tomorrow.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.873
I'm getting the nurses new cars

09:00.957 --> 09:03.960
and wanted the volunteers
to drive up in them as a surprise.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.754
-That's amazing.
-Not if you ask Nurse Julia.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.257
She wants to throw a potluck
in the break room.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.260
That's depressing.
Can't drive a car into the break room.

09:12.343 --> 09:16.430
What can I do? I can't kidnap everybody
and take them to Disney World.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.894
You're gonna have to say something.
Otherwise, it's gonna be a long trip

09:21.978 --> 09:24.105
if I'm the only one talking
for seven hours.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.107
-Seven hours?
-Seven hours? Whoa. Wait.

09:26.190 --> 09:29.026
-Where are you taking us?
-The destination is a surprise.

09:29.110 --> 09:32.363
I don't like surprises,
especially when they're seven hours away.

09:32.446 --> 09:36.033
You realize we have lives
and jobs and people who depend on us?

09:36.117 --> 09:38.703
I took the liberty of calling your offices

09:38.786 --> 09:42.206
-to inform them you'd be gone for the day.
-Know how to send an Amber Alert?

09:42.290 --> 09:44.875
Does Hans know he's aiding and abetting?

09:44.959 --> 09:48.379
I am calling the police and telling them
to meet us at the next gas station.

09:48.462 --> 09:52.466
Give me 24 hours to show you
what a caring, unselfish mother I am

09:52.550 --> 09:55.803
who can put her children first.
If you don't believe me,

09:55.886 --> 09:58.139
I will stop meddling in your lives.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.724
Like, permanently?

10:03.394 --> 10:05.104
-Okay, deal.
-Wonderful.

10:05.187 --> 10:08.983
Oh! Because I could be Goldie Hawn
and you could be Kate Hudson and...

10:10.651 --> 10:13.321
Kate Hudson's sister.
So I packed some treats

10:13.404 --> 10:15.364
just for the spirit of this trip.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.365
Mm. Mm.

10:16.449 --> 10:21.120
Amanda, would a selfish mother track down
very-hard-to-find cookies in the U.K.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.706
just because
it's her daughter's favorites?

10:23.789 --> 10:26.792
Good guess.
Who doesn't like chocolate chip cookies?

10:26.876 --> 10:30.004
Why does she get cookies
and I have a list of songs?

10:30.087 --> 10:34.634
I don't like those songs, but you do.
So this is the playlist for the trip.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.761
Again, unselfish.

10:36.844 --> 10:40.056
Now it's time for a Lizzo sing-along.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.391
-Hit it, Hans.
-No, don't hit it, Hans.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.978
Nobody is in the mood for a sing-along.
Not even Lizzo.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.439
-[Cristal] We have a contract.
-[Blake] I'll handle it myself.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.066
What about innocent until proven guilty?

10:50.149 --> 10:51.108
You let me know.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.069
-Fine. Goodbye.
-Fine. Goodbye.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.990
That was our contact
at the Department of Defense.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.786
She suspended our transport deal
in response to Adam's legal issues.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.829
A lot of my clients have political clout--

11:03.913 --> 11:05.831
-Not now.
-Maybe we can sue

11:05.915 --> 11:08.626
-and force them to honor commitments.
-I know these people.

11:08.709 --> 11:11.212
Tying them up in court
is just gonna make them angrier.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.130
Nobody wants that. Maybe we--

11:13.214 --> 11:16.258
You have any actual suggestions,
or do you just wanna shoot mine down?

11:16.342 --> 11:17.301
I'm sorry?

11:18.386 --> 11:21.013
We need to clarify
that this is about Alexam,

11:21.097 --> 11:22.932
not Flores or PPA.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.893
Smart. If anyone deserves
to be eviscerated, it's Alexis.

11:25.976 --> 11:28.354
Ooh. We could leak something
about Dex and his hedge fund.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.647
[cell phone buzzes]

11:29.730 --> 11:30.731
[Blake] Okay.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.318
Lawyers have settled
and paid off six of the plaintiffs

11:34.402 --> 11:37.196
in the civil suits against Adam,
but one woman still refuses.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.698
-Now what?
-Now it's time for the closer.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.075
About that Dex idea?

11:41.158 --> 11:42.326
-Let's go.
-[Adam] Okay.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.665
[Michael] If you're gonna take
all top three floors,

11:47.748 --> 11:49.917
we're gonna need the whole weekend.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.710
Are you even listening to me?

11:52.503 --> 11:57.842
Yes, you said something about a text,
a book, and, uh, cleaning the floors.

11:57.925 --> 12:03.264
I said a tech billionaire wants to book
the top three floors for a conference.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.933
Right, that's basically what I said.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.518
Okay, what is going on?

12:07.601 --> 12:11.522
Oh, nothing much, except La Mirage
is apparently now a hub for...

12:13.190 --> 12:14.567
-escorts.
-What?

12:14.650 --> 12:19.071
Yeah, half a dozen are in the bar.
While I have nothing against sex workers,

12:19.155 --> 12:22.283
people are starting to call
the hookah lounge "the hooker lounge."

12:22.366 --> 12:24.660
Which, yes, it's clever, but--

12:24.743 --> 12:28.122
But we're finished if clients find out
and start canceling reservations.

12:28.205 --> 12:30.458
-Which is why we need to get rid of them.
-How?

12:31.667 --> 12:35.379
We can't approach random women
and accuse them of being escorts.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.466
Also, we're the owners.
People will see us coming a mile away.

12:39.425 --> 12:43.637
I already have a pretty solid lead
on who the queen escort is.

12:43.721 --> 12:47.183
Miss Thang has been buzzing around
like she knows everyone.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.854
Probably because she does.
That's Anika from the Billing Department.

12:52.354 --> 12:53.314
Oh, Anika.

12:53.397 --> 12:54.773
[chuckles nervously]

12:55.024 --> 12:57.610
Well, she shouldn't be day-drinking.

12:57.693 --> 12:59.069
[Alexis] This is so nice.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.238
Oh, come on, girls.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.867
I mean, if by nice,
you mean sticky, then yes.

13:04.950 --> 13:09.955
For some reason, ordering off a menu that
has photos on it makes me wanna vomit.

13:10.039 --> 13:14.084
If this is your way of showing us you're
an unselfish mother, big fail so far.

13:14.168 --> 13:18.088
Fallon, look around.
We're here because of you.

13:18.172 --> 13:21.634
We used to stop here
on the way to the Carrington Compound.

13:21.717 --> 13:25.095
I hated it,
but you loved it, so we always came.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.139
Why would anyone like it here?

13:27.223 --> 13:29.475
-Especially Fallon?
-[snaps fingers]

13:38.567 --> 13:39.944

13:40.027 --> 13:42.488
Fallon was obsessed with <i>Annie.</i>

13:42.571 --> 13:44.448
She used to sing along, even.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.159
This trip feels more
about you wanting a sing-along

13:47.243 --> 13:49.161
than showing us
that you're a great mother.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.249
That's enough <i>Annie.</i>
Thank you, that was fun.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.959
-[diners clap]
-[Fallon] Great job.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.919
That was wonderful. Thank you.

13:57.002 --> 14:00.756
Yes, I did love <i>Annie,</i>
but only because I related to her.

14:00.839 --> 14:04.134
A girl surviving on her own
without her parents?

14:04.218 --> 14:07.263
Sure, Annie was abandoned
and left in an orphanage,

14:07.346 --> 14:10.182
and I was alone in the Carrington Manor,
but you get the parallels.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.769
I was hoping this pit stop
would trigger something positive.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.604
No, just childhood trauma.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.689
[Alexis sighs]

14:16.772 --> 14:18.399
Girls, get off your phones.

14:18.482 --> 14:22.069
Engage in the road-trip activities.
I have 20 hours left.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.446
I'm sorry if I seem a bit distracted,

14:24.530 --> 14:27.867
but FSN lost a major advertiser
because of your scandal.

14:27.950 --> 14:31.912
That, and I am trying to open up
a hydroelectric plant in one week.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.294
-Wanna share a milk shake?
-Uh, small reminder,

14:38.377 --> 14:41.714
I've never been here,
because you did abandon me as a child.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.340
-So... Oh.
-[cell phone buzzes]

14:43.424 --> 14:45.885
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna take
this call from the hospital.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.763
Hello. Hey, what's happening?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.391
What can I get started for you?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.853
You can start
by coming back tomorrow, Annie.

15:01.483 --> 15:04.945
I've told you two, we need
to keep this area clear. Move along.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.117
Seems like somebody is having a rough day.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.745
Banana split
to turn that frown upside down?

15:12.828 --> 15:17.082
Dairy and I don't agree. Sugar leads
to obesity, diabetes, heart disease.

15:17.166 --> 15:21.211
Right. While I have you,
can we talk about the party for tomorrow?

15:21.295 --> 15:23.631
It'd be fab if we had it in the garden,

15:23.714 --> 15:25.883
and fresh air is a prescription
for good health.

15:25.966 --> 15:30.262
Like I told Mr. Colby,
patients walking outside is a liability.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.057
Not to mention a logistical nightmare.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.060
Approving overtime
for half the staff on this wing?

15:37.561 --> 15:41.482
Well, word in the neuro ward
is you favor some nurses over others.

15:41.565 --> 15:45.527
I mean, agreeing to overtime for some,
making others change bedpans.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.112
Some need tough love.

15:47.196 --> 15:51.450
When you factor in padding your own hours,
it all seems rather unfair.

15:51.533 --> 15:55.120
Unfair? That's an unfounded rumor.
You must have heard wrong.

15:55.204 --> 15:59.625
I don't think so. My hearing is 20/20.
You know who else has great hearing?

15:59.708 --> 16:03.295
My girlfriend, Amanda Carrington,
lead counsel here.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.797
Once she starts digging,

16:04.880 --> 16:07.675
-those rumors will be founded.
-She wouldn't.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.511
She would.
Unless you give Mr. Colby what he wants.

16:10.594 --> 16:15.391
If he wants to have that party, I think
you're the one that can make it happen.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.352
Or lactose intolerance
will be the least of your problems.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.939
Okay. What does this escort deal
have to do with me?

16:22.022 --> 16:24.108
Escorts are attracted
to wealthy single men,

16:24.191 --> 16:25.526
so naturally, we thought of you.

16:25.609 --> 16:30.781
Okay. But I'm pretty sure you know I'm...
married, considering you were both there.

16:30.864 --> 16:32.616
It was a beautiful ceremony.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.786
-Except for the guy wielding the knife.
-We're getting off topic.

16:35.869 --> 16:39.790
All we need you to do is be part
of a sting to identify one escort.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.041
-That's all you need?
-Mm-hm.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.168
No. Sorry,
I'm not getting roped into any of this.

16:43.252 --> 16:47.548
I have no desire to pretend
to look for a prostitute. It's unseemly.

16:47.631 --> 16:51.385
We wouldn't want you
to break your moral compass or anything.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.512
That was a low blow.
And you know what I mean.

16:53.595 --> 16:57.391
All I know is sometimes
we do dishonest things for good reasons.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.935
You know, desperate times and all that.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.353
He makes a good point.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.064
Fine, I'll do it.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.818
Then we're done doing bad things
for good reasons. Okay?

17:08.819 --> 17:12.865
-Are you gonna eat that sandwich?
-I've lost my appetite. Have at it, boys.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.118
Nancy, hi.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.704
-I'm Blake Carrington.
-I know who you are.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.083
Both of you.
And it's illegal to speak to me ex parte.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.252
This will take a second.
I wanna make a deal.

17:25.335 --> 17:30.549
Now, we both know that the Alexam product
had nothing to do with your heart issues,

17:30.632 --> 17:35.554
but I'm willing to pay you an insane
amount of money to make that official.

17:35.637 --> 17:39.016
I've rejected your lawyers' offer.
What makes you think my mind's changed?

17:39.099 --> 17:41.143
Because it's double the original?

17:41.226 --> 17:44.563
What hasn't changed is I want you
to be held accountable for your actions.

17:44.646 --> 17:49.026
I hate to even suggest this,
but, like, how can we be sure

17:49.109 --> 17:52.654
that your problems didn't start
with a preexisting condition?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.783
[Adam] Were you on medications?
Anything contraindicated?

17:55.866 --> 17:59.036
Did you use more than one injectable
during a three-month time frame?

17:59.119 --> 18:02.539
I don't appreciate the third degree.
And I know the truth.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.666
The truth is what we say it is.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.086
My daughter is lead counsel
at the hospital,

18:07.169 --> 18:08.879
and she has access to patient charts.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.715
Are you threatening to alter my records?

18:11.799 --> 18:13.592
I am not threatening anything.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.179
I'm saying that your case
may not be as strong as you think.

18:23.685 --> 18:24.686
Thank you.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.398
No need to thank me,
but the clasp on your necklace is fixed.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.360
I spoke to my assistant.
Did you use my name to threaten a nurse?

18:31.443 --> 18:32.903
-Did I what?
-You heard me.

18:32.986 --> 18:37.116
It wasn't threatening. It was
more persuading. It was for a good cause.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.327
-I wasn't gonna follow through.
<i>-That's not the point.</i>

18:40.410 --> 18:43.997
-What happened to rigorous honesty?
-It was on hold. I wanted to help Jeff.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.791
By harming my reputation?

18:45.874 --> 18:49.002
-That wasn't my intention, really.
-It doesn't matter.

18:49.086 --> 18:53.423
Now I have to do a mountain of paperwork
to approve the expense and the overtime--

18:53.507 --> 18:56.135
I just pray that Julia
is not gonna file an HR complaint.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.220
-I'll talk to Julia.
-Please don't.

18:58.303 --> 19:01.265
I don't know
what you're overcompensating for,

19:01.348 --> 19:04.977
but you should figure it out.
And next time, leave me out of it.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.687
[scoffs]

19:08.147 --> 19:11.358
I moved into the penthouse
to be closer to my children.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.527
Completely unselfish.

19:13.610 --> 19:16.822
Yeah. Moving into a penthouse
worth millions of dollars

19:16.905 --> 19:19.616
in the best part of Atlanta
was a sacrifice. I applaud you.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.077
No. No, no. You are twisting my words.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.706
And, hey,
I ran over Mimi Rose Prescott in my car

19:25.789 --> 19:28.041
to help you secure
a wedding venue, remember?

19:28.125 --> 19:30.711
Can someone tell me
how to turn off notifications?

19:31.295 --> 19:34.047
No, no, no.
The board wants to meet in person

19:34.131 --> 19:37.551
to discuss all the advertisers
that are pulling out of FSN.

19:37.634 --> 19:41.138
Where should I tell them I am?
I don't think hell is specific enough.

19:41.722 --> 19:42.848
Are we in Charleston?

19:42.931 --> 19:46.435
Yes. I want to look at a house.
I want your opinions.

19:46.518 --> 19:50.397
Wait a minute. You dragged us
to an open house in Charleston?

19:50.480 --> 19:51.690
Okay, that's enough.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.567
No, it is not enough.

19:53.650 --> 19:58.447
Neither of you has been paying attention.
You know what? That changes right now.

20:04.036 --> 20:04.995
[Alexis] Ahh.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.458
You crossed state lines.
So do you know what that means?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.668
Now this is a federal offense.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.463
And you owe us new phones.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.011
[electronic lounge music playing]

20:21.094 --> 20:24.306
I'm starting to think
this may not be one of our best ideas.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.892
Patience. Look, a target's approaching.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.311
-Is this seat taken?
-Yeah.

20:29.394 --> 20:32.648
Uh, no. It-- It can be. By you.

20:33.649 --> 20:37.653
-Only if you let me get you a drink first.
-Smooth. That'd be lovely.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.490
I'll take a paper plane, up.
Top shelf only.

20:41.573 --> 20:42.407
Make that two.

20:43.784 --> 20:47.120
You got expensive taste.
How much will the night cost me?

20:47.871 --> 20:50.499
-Excuse me?
-Is that not how this works?

20:51.083 --> 20:53.794
Oh, is it more like an hourly thing?

21:00.926 --> 21:01.760
Okay, okay.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.931
-So she may not be an escort.
-No. More like a UFC fighter.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.057
I tried. I'm done.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.518
[Sam] Sit back down.
It's only been two minutes.

21:09.601 --> 21:13.814
Maybe you should just put in more effort.
Okay? You got this.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.046

21:39.006 --> 21:41.466
-Hmm.
-Mm-mm.

21:42.718 --> 21:46.263
You should work on your game.
Lots of incomplete passes.

21:46.888 --> 21:51.643
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm a little rusty.
Don't worry, I won't try a line on you.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.980
Good, because I'm more
of a fig girl myself.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.274
But dates work too.

If you're looking for company,
I'll be free in an hour.

You should know that's the only thing
about me that's free.

22:08.118 --> 22:11.580
Can I ask you a monetary question
without getting slapped?

22:11.663 --> 22:12.956
Slapping will be extra.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.817
the criminal trial will fall apart,

22:40.901 --> 22:43.653
leaving the runway open
to shift the narrative away

22:43.737 --> 22:45.530
from Adam and the Carringtons.

22:45.614 --> 22:46.615
It won't be that easy.

22:46.698 --> 22:49.743
Thanks to Alexam,
PPA is now under federal review

22:49.826 --> 22:52.162
for shipping products
containing illegal drugs.

22:52.245 --> 22:54.206
I'll take one of the jets to D.C.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.625
and have a boozy dinner
with the FAA administrator.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.835
No, you won't. Until this goes away,

22:58.919 --> 23:01.338
the only place you should be flying
is under the radar.

23:01.421 --> 23:04.257
If Anders were here,
this would have all been taken care of.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.801
But he's not.

23:05.884 --> 23:09.971
We can find you a majordomo,
but for now, distance yourself from Adam.

23:10.597 --> 23:13.683
The further he falls, the further he drags
down the Carrington name.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.144
-He's my son, Cristal.
-Exactly.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.772
Which is why he knows you'll bail him out.

23:18.855 --> 23:21.024
Hey. Press is out there waiting.

23:21.108 --> 23:24.778
Um, I was gonna stand with you,
as a show of strength.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.488
I have prepared remarks,

23:26.571 --> 23:29.241
but I don't have to talk
unless they ask me questions.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.745
Not gonna happen. I appreciate the offer,

23:33.829 --> 23:36.915
-um, but I'm gonna go solo on this.
-Okay.

23:36.998 --> 23:40.627
-Uh, what is it you're planning on saying?
-Don't worry about it.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.589
[Liam] <i>This is not okay.</i>

23:44.673 --> 23:46.883
I will not pay for sex.

23:46.967 --> 23:50.220
My God, Liam.
No one is asking you to actually have sex.

23:50.303 --> 23:52.472
The police need to catch her
accepting money.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.849
Police are involved?

23:53.932 --> 23:56.351
We'll tell them you're part of the sting.

23:56.434 --> 23:59.688
I'm sure they'll believe that.
And if they do, Fallon won't.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.941
Fallon doesn't need to find out.
Just like no one needs to find out

24:03.024 --> 24:04.860
about the book you "wrote."

24:04.943 --> 24:05.902
Wow.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.906
I confided in you during my most
vulnerable moment, and now, what?

24:09.990 --> 24:13.952
-You're using it to blackmail me?
-Something you guys want to share?

24:14.035 --> 24:17.956
No. Liam just needs to know
I will support him in whatever he does...

24:18.456 --> 24:19.708
after tonight.

24:20.292 --> 24:24.045
Oh. Well, that cleared it up.
Okay. So are you in or not?

24:25.463 --> 24:26.840
-Fine.
-[Michael] Yes!

24:26.923 --> 24:29.676
But I'm not getting arrested.
That is where I draw the line.

24:29.759 --> 24:32.721
I have a plan
to make Bianca and her friends leave

24:33.597 --> 24:35.348
and keep you out of jail.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.977
So, what do you think?

24:39.519 --> 24:41.605
Honestly? It's an awful investment.

24:41.688 --> 24:44.024
What are you and Dex gonna do
with a house this big?

24:44.107 --> 24:46.443
[Amanda] I agree.
Also, isn't this what the Internet is for?

24:46.526 --> 24:48.236
They do have online tours.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.949
Can we please leave now? I'll call Blake
to send the private plane to meet us.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.786
Okay, I'm not buying this house.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.040
Okay.

25:00.123 --> 25:02.292
At least you're listening to advice.

25:02.375 --> 25:05.086
No, I was never planning
to buy this house.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.630
What are we doing here?

25:06.713 --> 25:09.174
I used to own this house.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.385
But I sold it a long time ago.

25:13.428 --> 25:15.096
I rented it so we could be here

25:15.180 --> 25:17.557
and I could show you
what kind of mother I really am.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.309
What are you talking about?

25:19.392 --> 25:22.103
We were going to live here
when you were young.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.481
And I mean you too, Amanda.

25:25.482 --> 25:30.612
I had a whole plan for us
to be one big, happy family.

25:32.739 --> 25:35.033
[reporter] PPA is linked
to the Alexam scandal

25:35.116 --> 25:37.953
and accused of transporting illegal goods.

25:38.036 --> 25:41.039
-Can you explain your involvement?
-We have no involvement.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.877
I was shocked when I heard
about what was happening to these women.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.379
Let me emphasize again,

25:48.088 --> 25:51.967
neither PPA nor Flores Incorporado
knew anything about this.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.635
You're related to Adam Carrington.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.221
You expect the public
to believe you were unaware?

25:56.304 --> 25:59.391
Adam is my son, yes.
But that doesn't mean I knew

25:59.474 --> 26:02.269
about his actions beforehand,
nor do I condone them.

26:02.352 --> 26:05.981
But just as the child shouldn't suffer
the sins of the father,

26:06.064 --> 26:09.109
well, the reverse is also true.
And make no mistake...

26:10.944 --> 26:13.071
Adam Carrington has sinned.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.699
Blake Carrington has not.

26:16.491 --> 26:20.245
And Adam will have to face
the consequences of what he has done.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.162
Thank you.

26:22.622 --> 26:23.873
[reporters chattering]

26:23.957 --> 26:26.751
When it became clear
that my marriage to your father was over,

26:26.835 --> 26:30.046
I spared no expense
to have this home custom-built.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.008
Notice the imported
Brazilian floors throughout.

26:33.091 --> 26:36.011
The Moroccan zellige tiles
in the powder room.

26:36.094 --> 26:40.056
What does hiring an expensive
interior designer have to do with us?

26:40.140 --> 26:43.310
I had plans
to put a paddock out back, Fallon.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.979
I wanted to foster
your passion for riding.

26:46.062 --> 26:48.648
I knew being away from your horses
wouldn't be easy.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.402
I turned the study
into a library for Steven

26:52.485 --> 26:54.904
so he had a place all his own to read.

26:55.655 --> 26:57.574
His nose was always in a book.

26:58.616 --> 27:01.244
Amanda, your bedroom was upstairs.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.622
I filled it with all
of your favorite things from London.

27:04.706 --> 27:08.209
I even painted it bright green
because it was your favorite.

27:08.793 --> 27:12.589
I might not have been your mother,
but I did keep tabs on you.

27:14.090 --> 27:17.886
Can you see how far I went
to make you feel at home here?

27:17.969 --> 27:20.096
Yes, but we never lived here.

27:20.638 --> 27:24.309
Did we? You left when I was 14,
and I didn't see you for years.

27:24.392 --> 27:26.686
You may have decorated a bedroom for me,

27:26.770 --> 27:29.564
but you did spend 25 years
not claiming me as your daughter.

27:29.647 --> 27:31.232
I don't think that's very fair.

27:31.316 --> 27:34.861
Neither is life.
We're leaving first thing in the morning.

27:34.944 --> 27:38.531
[scoffs] This entire house
is you in a nutshell,

27:39.199 --> 27:41.409
big promises with no follow-through.

27:47.457 --> 27:48.833
[sultry R&amp;B music playing]

27:48.917 --> 27:50.001
What do you think?

27:50.752 --> 27:52.712
Could I launch a thousand ships?

27:52.796 --> 27:56.257
Uh, you are well worth
the price of admission.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.926
Which is what, exactly?

27:58.009 --> 28:01.930
We don't have to deal with compensation
until after you're satisfied.

28:02.013 --> 28:05.266
Yeah. But I--
See, I would really like to pay in advance

28:05.350 --> 28:07.727
just so I can be fully in the moment.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.187
You're ruining the moment.

28:09.270 --> 28:12.190
-Let me help you relax.
-Um, I just, um...

28:13.691 --> 28:16.403
I don't like having debts
held over my head.

28:16.986 --> 28:19.406
Fine. It's $1000 an hour.

28:20.156 --> 28:22.659
Great. Yeah, let's just, uh,

28:22.742 --> 28:24.744
settle up so there's no confusion.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.496
You're acting strange.

28:26.579 --> 28:27.580
Huh?

28:27.664 --> 28:31.084
Oh, no. It's just-- I've, um--
I-- I've never done this before.

28:32.043 --> 28:36.131
No. I-- I've done it.
"It" I've done before, just not like this.

28:36.798 --> 28:39.551
-Bingo.
-What?

28:39.634 --> 28:41.469
-I said, bingo!
-[door opens]

28:42.053 --> 28:44.848
[officer] All right. Nobody move.
You're under arrest for solicitation.

28:46.015 --> 28:46.975
I didn't do anything.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.728
[officer] We've got you on CCTV
accepting money for sex.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.439
I know you've been running
an escort service.

28:52.522 --> 28:54.441
You're going to lady jail, lady.

28:54.524 --> 28:55.859
This is entrapment.

28:55.942 --> 28:58.528
Uh, we can let the courts decide that.

28:59.362 --> 29:02.365
Unless you and your friends promise

29:02.449 --> 29:05.952
to stay far away from La Mirage for good.

29:06.536 --> 29:10.790
And then I can make all of this go away,
forget it ever happened.

29:11.374 --> 29:13.334
Something sketchy is going on.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.295
No, no, no. Nothing sketchy.

29:15.378 --> 29:18.715
I just have a really good relationship
with the police.

29:18.798 --> 29:21.593
But I, uh, can't help you
if you don't agree.

29:22.260 --> 29:25.388
And listen, I'm sure
there are plenty of hotels out there

29:25.472 --> 29:27.599
that would love to have you.

29:27.682 --> 29:29.017
So, what do you say?

29:30.560 --> 29:31.561
Deal?

29:33.772 --> 29:34.606
Deal.

29:36.191 --> 29:39.194
Officer, could you loosen these cuffs?
They're cutting off my circulation.

29:39.277 --> 29:43.740
Yeah. Sorry, I got a little
too into character there, I guess.

29:44.407 --> 29:45.450
But, well...

29:46.159 --> 29:49.245
-They're normally a prop.
-Thank you so much for doing this.

29:49.329 --> 29:53.500
No, this was fun. I think the longest
I've kept this costume on too.

29:53.583 --> 29:57.837
-Oh.
-But I'd say, all in all, success, yeah?

29:57.921 --> 29:59.422
-Success.
-[Liam] Yeah.

29:59.506 --> 30:02.717
It definitely was for Bianca.
She left with my money.

30:03.343 --> 30:06.971
Sorry, soft scramble is the extent
of my culinary ability.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.306
We're leaving soon.

30:08.389 --> 30:10.642
I know. I appreciate you staying over.

30:11.267 --> 30:14.020
I was up the entire night thinking,
and you are right.

30:14.103 --> 30:15.230
I can be selfish,

30:15.313 --> 30:18.441
and this relic of a house
is emblematic of who I am,

30:18.525 --> 30:20.819
a mother who made some bad decisions.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.987
An instance where sending an e-mail

30:23.071 --> 30:25.198
would've been easier
than an out-of-state trip.

30:25.281 --> 30:28.660
But both of you are being selfish
and unfair as well.

30:29.285 --> 30:30.703
I can't change the past.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.413
So you need to hear me out.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.376
After I bought this place,
I went to visit you, Amanda.

30:37.252 --> 30:39.879
I was going to tell you the truth
and bring you back.

30:39.963 --> 30:42.298
I saw you play Emily in <i>Our Town.</i>

30:42.382 --> 30:43.466
Her Emily was sublime,

30:43.550 --> 30:46.636
but the stage manager might as well
have been reading the phone book.

30:47.554 --> 30:51.558
While I was waiting to give you roses,
I saw how close you were to your parents.

30:52.141 --> 30:55.311
I realized it would be devastating
for them if I took you back.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.522
It wouldn't have been the best for you.

30:57.605 --> 31:00.483
I stayed quiet,
and I have always regretted that.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.777
What about your children that lived here?

31:02.861 --> 31:05.446
After the divorce, I was left penniless.

31:06.114 --> 31:08.449
Blake threatened prison
if I didn't leave quietly,

31:08.533 --> 31:11.244
and he paid off a judge
to keep you and Steven.

31:12.161 --> 31:14.664
-I never knew that part.
-I never told you.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.793
So instead of facing prison,
I escaped to Europe

31:18.877 --> 31:21.671
and found comfort
in the arms of counts and viceroys.

31:21.754 --> 31:25.675
If this is true, then what took you
so long to tell us this?

31:25.758 --> 31:27.677
It's not easy to talk about.

31:27.760 --> 31:31.681
It's not my proudest moment,
plus Blake would've denied everything.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.100
She does have a point.

31:34.183 --> 31:37.020
I want to move forward in my life,
and I want you in it.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.772
But to do that,
there can't be any secrets.

31:39.856 --> 31:44.360
So Dex has been encouraging me
to express the full extent of my emotions.

31:44.444 --> 31:47.238
-I'm not sure we need the full extent.
-You're getting them.

31:47.947 --> 31:50.491
I'm going to terminate
my contract with FSN.

31:51.200 --> 31:54.287
I'm sorry for all of the drama
Alexam has caused you.

31:54.370 --> 31:58.291
-Are you serious?
-FSN is Alexam's biggest revenue producer,

31:58.833 --> 32:01.586
and to have my daughter's brand
support mine means the world.

32:01.669 --> 32:03.880
But a deal is a deal.

32:04.547 --> 32:08.301
And I will be exiting
both of your lives permanently.

32:09.594 --> 32:12.722
I have hired a second car
to take you back to Atlanta.

32:16.434 --> 32:20.271
-Did you really play Emily in <i>Our Town?</i>
-I did.

32:21.105 --> 32:23.274
And the stage manager was terrible.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.736
Maybe she did come and see me.

32:29.739 --> 32:32.700
Hey. Why aren't you outside
enjoying the party?

32:32.784 --> 32:36.913
I offered to cover the phones
so Nurse Julia could get hors d'oeuvres.

32:36.996 --> 32:39.499
There are some real professionals nearby.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.834
You missed the nurses getting new cars.

32:41.918 --> 32:46.047
And the patients soaking in the sun.
It's quite the sight.

32:46.631 --> 32:50.426
I don't know how you did it,
but thank you for making outside happen.

32:50.510 --> 32:53.554
It was nothing.
Just pulled a few hard-to-reach strings.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.515
But if you're happy, it was worth it.

32:56.099 --> 32:59.310
Even through all the craziness
these past few years,

33:00.770 --> 33:02.146
you've been a great friend.

33:03.398 --> 33:04.232
Okay.

33:08.152 --> 33:11.698
I need to tell you something
that's been eating me up inside.

33:12.865 --> 33:15.827
I knew about Blake owning ColbyCo
months ago, and I didn't tell you.

33:17.537 --> 33:18.496
Are you kidding?

33:19.205 --> 33:22.834
I was in an awkward position
between you and Amanda and Blake.

33:22.917 --> 33:25.753
-I hope you understand.
-Yeah, actually, I don't.

33:26.796 --> 33:29.757
You saw me flailing.
You didn't say a thing.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.677
I feel awful. But I'm telling you now.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.263
It's part of my commitment
to rigorous honesty.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.349
Here's some rigorous honesty for you.

33:39.475 --> 33:42.895
You took Blake's side,
and you're six months too late.

33:46.107 --> 33:48.067
Hans, take the less scenic route.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.695
Hand me the cookies. I'm going back alone.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.490
