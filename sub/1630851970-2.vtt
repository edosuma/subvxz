WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:12.888
Keep the doorway open wide

00:14.056 --> 00:23.148
Until we come slowly strollin'
Side by side

00:24.399 --> 00:28.028
Till I'm strollin' through that doorway
With my bride

00:35.869 --> 00:38.705
Can we have the bar mitzvah boy
join us by the stage?

00:46.046 --> 00:48.340
-Where the hell is he?
-I don't know.

00:51.927 --> 00:55.806
Marty. Marty, it's me.
I know you're in here.

00:55.889 --> 00:56.974
Please come out.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.559
No. My tummy hurts.

00:58.642 --> 01:01.478
Well, wrap up whatever you're doing,
and let's go back in.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.272
-You missed the hora.
-I don't care.

01:03.355 --> 01:05.274
There's too many people.
They're all looking at me.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.280
Have you seen the pile of presents?

01:12.406 --> 01:15.284
You could start a fountain pen store
if you just get through the next hour.

01:15.367 --> 01:18.704
How about we light the candles,
have a little cake,

01:18.787 --> 01:20.914
do a dance with Grandma Flo,
and get out of here?

01:20.998 --> 01:24.126
I'll be with you the whole time.
I promise.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.763
Fantastic. Would you get over here?
Come on.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.601
All right. Everybody smile.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.786
Joel, the bubble gum.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.748
Did you have that before,
or did you find it underneath the seat?

02:02.831 --> 02:03.832
-Come on, Joel.
-Hi, Mommy.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.876
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, guys.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.336
-How was the movie?
-Really good.

02:07.419 --> 02:10.088
The man dressed up as a woman
and then another man kissed him.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.715
-Excellent.
-It was fun.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.300
-It's a lot of fun, yeah.
-Yeah.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.384
How was your afternoon?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.762
I drove into Midtown,
I got a parking ticket,

02:16.845 --> 02:20.057
I argued with the traffic cop
for 20 minutes. It was heaven.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.601
An uninterrupted conversation
with an adult.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.186
So that was fantastic.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.563
Okay. Look, I gotta go.

02:27.147 --> 02:27.981
Did they have lunch?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.900
Sure did. Sno-Caps and jujubes.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.068
-Marty.
-I gotta run.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.780
Wait. Your birthday.
We need to make a plan.

02:34.863 --> 02:38.200
-No. You know I don't like a fuss.
-Well, it doesn't have to be a big to-do.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.494
Come over early
so the kids can be a part of it.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.412
I'll broil some lamb chops.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.206
The fire alarm will go off.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.210
I promise I'll make sure
that nobody enjoys themselves.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.754
-Okay?
-Sounds perfect. Okay, I'll be there.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.257
Hey, where are you going anyway?
Got a d-a-t-e?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.967
-No. No, no, no.
-No?

02:55.050 --> 02:57.511
No. I'm going to see Dr. Herschkopf.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.264
-Again?
-Yeah.

03:01.682 --> 03:05.018
Marty, that's… I'm so happy.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.103
Is it working out?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.688
-I think. I don't know.
-Okay.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.399
I mean,
he wants me to talk about my feelings,

03:10.482 --> 03:12.192
but my main feeling is I don't want to.

03:12.276 --> 03:13.527
Marty.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.863
Look at you.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.365
Just keep talking about what worries you.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.449
-Okay?
-Yeah.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.326
-I'm so proud of you.
-All right.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.036
-Thank you for today.
-Bye. Okay.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.122
-I should go. Bye.
-I love you. I'm proud of you.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.206
-Bye.
-Bye, Uncle Marty.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.041
Phyllis has always been the strong one.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.836
But this past year, I mean…

03:30.919 --> 03:32.379
She's really been through a lot.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.382
Took my dad's death really hard, and then…

03:36.800 --> 03:39.887
She's getting a divorce.
I feel bad for her.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.054
So do I.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.223
But this is not her session.

03:44.433 --> 03:45.434
It's yours.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.147
Sorry. I'm still new at this.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.483
I really love your shirt, by the way.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.777
Is that Ralph Lauren?

03:56.403 --> 03:58.071
Lifshitz. That's his real name.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.323
Ralph Lifshitz.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.825
No. I never knew that.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.619
I know him a little.

04:03.702 --> 04:08.081
Took a picture with him at a UJA event.
He's a lovely guy. His stuff is timeless.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.416
It really is.

04:09.499 --> 04:14.463
But, Marty, you have very effectively
changed the subject once again.

04:14.963 --> 04:15.797
Now, come on.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.591
Stick with it.

04:17.673 --> 04:20.969
I'm curious,
how did your father's death affect you?

04:21.053 --> 04:22.053
Me?

04:23.138 --> 04:24.973
I mean, I'm fine.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.058
Fine?

04:27.059 --> 04:28.894
You lost your dad, Marty.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.855
You're well within your rights
not to be fine about it.

04:31.939 --> 04:32.940
Yeah.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.944
I guess not so fine.

04:38.028 --> 04:43.700
Do you know how empowering
and liberating it can be

04:44.201 --> 04:48.205
to allow yourself to feel a feeling
and name the feeling?

04:55.629 --> 04:56.755
I miss him.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.006
Of course you do.

04:58.549 --> 05:02.636
When I think about the fact
that he's gone, it feels…

05:04.471 --> 05:05.472
not good.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.267
There's no shame in feeling pain, Marty.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.978
Why do you miss him?

05:14.523 --> 05:15.649
He was my dad.

05:16.275 --> 05:17.943
And that meant you were the kid.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.904
And it's nice to be a kid.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.823
You don't have to be responsible.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.450
-Make decisions.
-Yeah.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.496
But now it's time for you to be the man,
and that's a scary thing.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.124
Yeah.

05:33.083 --> 05:37.421
That's because our fathers provide
a template of what it means to be a man.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.423
When we lose them,

05:40.716 --> 05:45.804
we feel like we lose
the paradigm of manhood along with them.

05:47.222 --> 05:50.559
Yes. Yeah, that's exactly it. That's it.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.019
Tell me more about that.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.941
Well, yeah. I guess, now that he's gone,

05:58.025 --> 06:03.238
I feel like, you know, everyone's
looking at me to fill his spot.

06:03.322 --> 06:04.323
But--

06:04.406 --> 06:07.326
But you're afraid
they still see you as a boy

06:07.409 --> 06:09.661
because that's how you still see yourself.

06:18.754 --> 06:22.966
I do believe you have just had
what we headshrinkers call a breakthrough.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.970
Jesus Christ.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.934
And we're out of time.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.022
I hate ending a session
right when we're getting somewhere,

06:37.856 --> 06:39.483
but the good doctor's got to eat.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.071
You know…

06:44.154 --> 06:46.490
I usually just go to the deli
and grab something,

06:46.573 --> 06:50.953
but if you wanna tag along
and finish this,

06:51.828 --> 06:53.038
that's okay.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.831
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.834
I-- Yeah,
I'd have to charge you for the time.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.627
-But, fine.
-No, no, no, no, no.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.087
That's fine.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.006
I'm great with that
as long as you don't mind.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.510
-So you're almost 40.
-Yeah.

07:07.427 --> 07:11.056
-What are you gonna do for your birthday?
-You sound like Phyllis.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.976
Nothing. I don't like parties.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.227
It's not my thing.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.479
Well, you must have had a bar mitzvah?

07:17.563 --> 07:19.481
Yeah, but I missed a lot of it.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.485
I was on the toilet.
I have digestive issues.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.821
Sometimes my insides get
tangled up on themselves

07:25.904 --> 07:27.656
-like a phone cord.
-I see.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.200
I even missed the hora.
It was a terrible day.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.204
Doctor.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.790
Try the chicken. It's the greatest.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.335
It looks spicy. My stomach.

07:40.419 --> 07:41.712
You're missing out, Marty.

07:42.546 --> 07:43.755
But then again,

07:43.839 --> 07:46.425
I suspect you miss out on a lot,
don't you?

07:46.508 --> 07:49.344
Do you think the goal in life is
to avoid getting hurt?

07:50.179 --> 07:52.556
The goal of life is to live.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.934
Getting hurt is just
the price of admission, my friend.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.104
So, what do you want?

08:01.106 --> 08:01.940
Okay.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.152
Yes. I would like to have…

08:05.652 --> 08:12.159
It would be my sincere wish
for you to make me… Yes.

08:12.242 --> 08:16.246
Yeah. Let's go with
the turkey on white bread.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.458
Dry, with a single piece of lettuce.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.543
No. No, no, no. No, no, no. Let's go--

08:21.627 --> 08:25.005
What about the roast beef?
Maybe roast beef on a kaiser, maybe?

08:25.881 --> 08:26.924
What do you think?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.842
I think you should
take some responsibility

08:28.926 --> 08:30.385
and make a decision.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.429
Pick a sandwich, okay?

08:32.513 --> 08:34.056
Go. Just say whatever comes out.

08:34.556 --> 08:37.726
Pick. What are you? Anything.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.645
-Don't think.
-Turkey!

08:39.727 --> 08:41.313
That's it. There we go. Done.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.023
Turkey sandwich, bland as hell.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.986
It's very clear to me,
Marty, as the only beloved son,

08:48.779 --> 08:51.365
you've been babied.
You haven't had to grow up.

08:51.949 --> 08:52.950
It's held you back.

08:54.952 --> 08:58.455
You're right. You're totally right.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.708
But no longer.
Grab the reins to your life.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.296
Show your staff, and the world,
who's boss.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.466
Be the ruler of your own domain.

09:14.763 --> 09:15.973
What you looking at?

09:18.350 --> 09:19.810
I have this new client.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.355
He reminded me of something today
I haven't thought about in a long time.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.317
-Look at this boy.
-Oh, my gosh.

09:27.401 --> 09:30.529
Is that your bar mitzvah?
You were so cute.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.030
Cute?

09:32.990 --> 09:34.533
Look how miserable I look.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.536
-That cheap suit.
-Is that a clip-on tie?

09:39.663 --> 09:41.081
Not all of us came from money.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.585
I'm not saying that.
I'd just forgotten they existed.

09:44.668 --> 09:49.590
I wanted it to be this big thing,
this big occasion.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.383
It wasn't.

09:52.968 --> 09:54.344
I didn't even get a party.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.055
Where did you find these pictures?

09:58.015 --> 09:59.808
I dug them out of the hall closet.

10:01.393 --> 10:05.772
I don't think
I've looked at them in, well, ever.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.025
I think you look adorable.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.068
Stop.

10:10.569 --> 10:13.197
And I'm sorry
your parents didn't make you feel special.

10:14.907 --> 10:15.908
It's fine.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.368
They couldn't afford it.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.872
And, honestly, they wouldn't know how.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.127
Well, I'd like to make you feel special.

10:29.046 --> 10:30.130
Is that so?

10:30.214 --> 10:31.924
It's very much so.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.178
I think I have kimchi breath.

10:38.931 --> 10:41.391
Yeah. Yeah.

11:08.585 --> 11:09.753
Look at the new threads.

11:11.255 --> 11:15.092
Oh, yeah. It's a Lifshitz.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.886
-That's his name in real life.
-Very sharp.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.055
Can I have everyone gather around?

11:21.306 --> 11:23.058
Now. Please?

11:24.685 --> 11:28.397
It is my job to guide you, my coworkers,

11:29.064 --> 11:33.068
towards successful outcomes
with workplace objectives.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.361
To that end,

11:34.444 --> 11:37.114
these are ground rules
I'm putting in place

11:37.197 --> 11:40.993
that will help the entire team
perform at optimum…

11:42.160 --> 11:43.161
performance.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.417
Work begins at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.252
Yeah. That's great.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.508
No more congregating
around the copier machine

11:56.592 --> 11:58.677
to talk about what happened
on Falcon Crest.

12:00.596 --> 12:05.475
Lunch is 36 minutes. Sorry, 30 minutes.

12:05.559 --> 12:10.522
My zero looks like a six.
So I misread that.

12:10.606 --> 12:13.775
-Sorry. Chaos at home.
-Hey, Phyllis. Morning.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.112
I didn't know there was a staff meeting.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.489
Would it have made a difference?

12:19.573 --> 12:20.782
Excuse me?

12:20.866 --> 12:22.868
Shouldn't you be on time no matter what?

12:25.746 --> 12:27.164
Well, if you must know,

12:27.998 --> 12:31.084
Joel shampooed his hair
with Nair this morning.

12:31.168 --> 12:34.004
So my eight-year-old looks
like Telly fucking Savalas.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.798
So please don't bust my nuts
over half an hour, thank you.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.259
What's got into him? Jesus Christ.

12:41.637 --> 12:43.305
Way to start a day.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.723
-Jesus.
-Waiting on Phyllis.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.683
Just putting my bag down,
thank you very much.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.936
-Soon as she finds a seat.
-A little compassion, Marty.

12:49.645 --> 12:50.646
My son is bald.

12:50.729 --> 12:53.732
Maybe you should keep your Nair
in a childproof cabinet.

12:53.815 --> 12:56.235
-Give me a break, Marty.
-Waiting on you, Phyllis.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.116
-Did you see Falcon Crest last night?
-I--

13:03.200 --> 13:04.368
-I'm gonna explode.
-Phyllis!

13:04.451 --> 13:05.911
-So moving--
-I--

13:07.538 --> 13:10.749
I am gonna have to bust your nuts
a little, okay?

13:11.416 --> 13:13.794
I'm trying to lay down the ground rules.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.046
Okay. Okay.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.173
Please.

13:20.092 --> 13:22.594
With the most important one being--

13:23.929 --> 13:24.930
Excuse me.

13:25.514 --> 13:29.184
The most important one being, at work, we…

13:30.394 --> 13:31.395
We…

13:33.188 --> 13:34.565
At work, we work.

13:34.648 --> 13:38.110
Okay. So that means
no personal conversations.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.611
And no chitchatting on the phone.

13:39.695 --> 13:43.240
Marty, Marty.
Dr. Herschkopf is on the phone.

13:43.782 --> 13:44.950
He is?

13:45.492 --> 13:49.580
Okay. Well, you know.
Technically that's a…

13:49.663 --> 13:51.373
I think that's work-related. So…

13:51.456 --> 13:53.250
He said it was a personal matter.

13:53.333 --> 13:57.129
Well, you better ask him to call you back.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.214
Right. Okay.

13:59.298 --> 14:03.093
On this one occasion,
as a point of personal privilege,

14:03.177 --> 14:06.722
I'm exempted from all
the aforementioned restrictions

14:06.805 --> 14:11.018
because, technically speaking,
these rules do not take effect

14:11.602 --> 14:13.979
until this meeting is adjourned.

14:14.062 --> 14:17.024
So, on that note, meeting adjourned.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.735
No. Meeting paused.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.410
Checkmate.

14:29.912 --> 14:30.913
Leroy.

14:30.996 --> 14:33.582
Never underestimate a pawn, man.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.960
There he is. Hey!

14:37.044 --> 14:39.421
-Hey, Leroy, you mind… Thanks.
-I don't mind.

14:39.505 --> 14:40.506
Have a seat.

14:42.466 --> 14:43.467
Sure.

14:44.510 --> 14:45.844
-Thanks for coming.
-Yeah.

14:46.345 --> 14:49.097
-I hope I didn't disturb your day.
-No, no. It's fine.

14:49.806 --> 14:50.933
Everything okay?

14:51.016 --> 14:52.684
Everything's great.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.854
I've been thinking about you, Marty.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.565
You've been thinking about me?

14:58.649 --> 15:02.152
Your birthday is coming up,
and I have a very exciting idea for you.

15:02.236 --> 15:05.656
You wanna step up,
become a new man, right?

15:05.739 --> 15:07.115
Turn a new chapter, yes?

15:08.283 --> 15:11.870
I think that you should mark
this important moment.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.792
I think you should have
a second bar mitzvah.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.127
-A what?
-A sequel.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.838
A rematch.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.297
Rocky got back in the ring.

15:22.798 --> 15:24.258
You're getting back on the bimah.

15:25.551 --> 15:26.844
-I don't know.
-But think about it.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.595
The first one still haunts you.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.223
Part of you is still stuck
in that bathroom

15:31.306 --> 15:33.016
with your bowels churning.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.561
This could be another chance.

15:35.644 --> 15:38.522
Do it again.
Perfect way to celebrate your 40th.

15:40.732 --> 15:41.733
Interesting.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.152
-You hate it.
-No.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.823
Think about it.
This would be a true rite of passage.

15:48.490 --> 15:52.077
A way to declare this new man,
this new you.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.121
I'm telling you, I love this idea.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.415
I don't want to sound unappreciative,

15:57.541 --> 15:58.542
but can I think about it?

15:59.334 --> 16:02.296
Of course. Well, I'm not gonna--
I'm not gonna force you.

16:02.963 --> 16:03.797
It's up to you.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.594
I got to go.

16:09.511 --> 16:10.596
See you in session.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.181
You have a great day, Marty.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.474
And let me know what you decide.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.211
-Hey. Thanks for letting me up.
-I knew you'd come.

16:42.294 --> 16:44.129
-Sorry?
-It was so unlike you.

16:44.213 --> 16:45.297
What are you talking about?

16:45.380 --> 16:47.591
Well,
I know you're here to apologize for today.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.675
For what?

16:48.759 --> 16:52.221
For being so rude to me
in front of the whole office.

16:52.304 --> 16:54.056
I'm sorry if you thought I was rude,

16:54.139 --> 16:55.474
but I'm trying to step up.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.267
I'm trying to be ruler of my own domain.

16:57.351 --> 17:00.270
Your domain? Got it.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.064
Yeah.

17:02.147 --> 17:06.483
So, I guess this therapy
is really working out, huh?

17:06.568 --> 17:09.112
-It is. It really is.
-Okay.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.074
And Dr. Ike had this idea.

17:12.156 --> 17:16.036
-Is that his name now? Dr. Ike?
-Yeah.

17:16.117 --> 17:19.665
At first, the idea sounded a little weird,
but listen to this.

17:20.499 --> 17:23.210
Dr. Ike thinks that for my 40th birthday…

17:25.712 --> 17:27.214
I should have a bar mitzvah.

17:30.843 --> 17:33.095
-You had a bar mitzvah.
-Right.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.638
A second one.

17:43.814 --> 17:45.732
What was wrong with the first?

17:46.316 --> 17:47.860
It was a terrible day, remember?

17:47.943 --> 17:49.778
I mangled my haftarah,

17:49.862 --> 17:52.155
and, I mean, I hid out in the bathroom.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.324
But Mom and Dad were so proud of you.

17:54.408 --> 17:56.243
They-- It meant so much to them.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.203
I know. But…

18:00.664 --> 18:02.040
Well…

18:04.334 --> 18:10.132
Well, this doctor seems
a little unconventional, huh?

18:10.215 --> 18:12.050
Yeah, I guess.

18:15.470 --> 18:19.433
But the thing is, he cares so much.

18:20.309 --> 18:22.477
And everything he's said
about me is right.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.479
I mean, he really sees me.

18:24.563 --> 18:28.567
He understands me, and the therapy works.

18:29.234 --> 18:32.070
I know it's just words
and they're just feelings and stuff,

18:32.154 --> 18:35.449
but when you say them out loud,
he's right, it's empowering.

18:35.532 --> 18:36.700
It's liberating.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.286
It's a relief.

18:39.369 --> 18:40.370
You know?

18:40.454 --> 18:45.292
And I'm feeling things and doing things
that I-- I just never…

18:47.711 --> 18:50.547
The thing is that his advice to me
has been spot-on,

18:50.631 --> 18:54.801
and if he thinks I should do this,
then maybe I should do it.

18:55.385 --> 18:56.386
Marty.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.141
I'm so happy for you.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.685
I really am.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.273
But you don't--

19:09.149 --> 19:11.360
You don't need to rush into anything.

19:11.443 --> 19:12.819
Why not? This is exciting.

19:12.903 --> 19:15.739
I'm ready for this. I really am. I--

19:15.822 --> 19:16.823
Marty.

19:17.407 --> 19:20.077
Is this about turning 40?

19:20.160 --> 19:21.370
No.

19:21.453 --> 19:24.623
There are other ways
to have a midlife crisis.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.042
You buy a Corvette, you know?

19:27.125 --> 19:30.546
Honestly, fuck a prostitute.
There's no judgment here.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.007
I feel good, Phyllis.

19:36.093 --> 19:37.386
Aren't you happy for me?

19:37.469 --> 19:39.805
Of course I am.

19:39.888 --> 19:43.016
I haven't felt this clearheaded
in a long time.

19:43.851 --> 19:44.852
I think it could be nice.

19:44.935 --> 19:46.937
And we'll do it together, you know?

19:47.020 --> 19:48.105
As a family.

19:53.193 --> 19:57.406
We already did it as a family, though,

19:57.990 --> 19:59.408
when you were 13.

20:00.158 --> 20:02.202
This time will be different.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.581
This time will be better.

20:23.557 --> 20:24.892
Yeah, trust me, Miriam.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.478
Say no to Florida. Do not go.
Put your foot down.

20:28.562 --> 20:30.230
Your mother will have to deal with it.

20:30.731 --> 20:32.900
Okay. Thank you.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.445
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:36.528 --> 20:37.529
Look who's early.

20:41.116 --> 20:44.494
So, I thought about it, and I wanna do it.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.455
That's great news.

20:46.538 --> 20:49.166
I really think this could be good
for me and, you know,

20:49.249 --> 20:50.792
my sister doesn't agree, but--

20:50.876 --> 20:52.753
but, you know, she'll come around.

20:52.836 --> 20:55.005
And the only thing is,
my birthday's in three weeks

20:55.088 --> 20:56.840
and I don't think
my temple can slot me in.

20:56.924 --> 20:59.301
Not to worry. I already talked to mine.

20:59.384 --> 21:00.969
-You did?
-I did.

21:01.470 --> 21:03.972
I had a feeling
you were gonna come around on this.

21:04.056 --> 21:05.682
I'm close with my rabbi,

21:05.766 --> 21:08.810
and I helped him through a rough patch
a couple of years ago.

21:08.894 --> 21:10.103
He's happy to make it happen.

21:10.187 --> 21:13.565
He already has one scheduled
for that day, so we can double up.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.235
Wow. I don't know what to say.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.654
Well, say you'll practice your tuchus off
and crush it.

21:18.737 --> 21:21.949
I'll invite some friends.
Help fill the place out.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.025
Rabbi.

21:57.109 --> 21:58.235
Phyllis, hi.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.279
I was wondering if I could talk to you
for a second.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.363
Sure, come on in.

22:01.446 --> 22:04.032
I was on my way to the sisterhood meeting,

22:04.116 --> 22:07.578
and I just wanted to grab you
for a second.

22:07.661 --> 22:08.912
Good to see you.

22:10.372 --> 22:14.334
I wanna bend your ear
about this whole bar mitzvah thing.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.837
I wanna know what you think.

22:16.920 --> 22:21.425
Because, to me,
it diminishes my parents and their memory.

22:22.551 --> 22:23.719
What bar mitzvah thing?

22:27.139 --> 22:28.432
Marty's bar mitzvah.

22:30.559 --> 22:31.852
-Your brother, Marty?
-Yes.

22:31.935 --> 22:35.147
This crazy idea for his 40th birthday.

22:35.856 --> 22:39.484
Sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:39.985 --> 22:42.404
-You begin.
-This is the first I've heard of it.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.948
So tell me more.

22:45.032 --> 22:46.450
Congregation.

22:50.996 --> 22:53.540
All right, Marty. Go ahead, give it a try.

23:00.464 --> 23:01.465
Sorry.

23:03.050 --> 23:04.426
All right, we'll get there.

23:04.510 --> 23:05.761
Very good.

23:05.844 --> 23:07.137
Emily, your turn.

23:24.780 --> 23:25.781
How's it going in here?

23:25.864 --> 23:28.242
Very well. Marty's working hard.

23:28.325 --> 23:29.993
Better be. Don't embarrass me, Marty.

23:30.077 --> 23:31.537
I've got a lot of people coming.

23:32.329 --> 23:33.372
I'll try not to.

23:34.540 --> 23:37.167
I'm just putting the final arrangements
on the big day.

23:37.251 --> 23:41.463
Rabbi, I'm still waiting
on the order of the aliyahs.

23:41.547 --> 23:43.257
Do you think you could
get that over to me?

23:43.340 --> 23:44.633
-Absolutely.
-All right.

23:44.716 --> 23:46.468
I gotta check on the electricity
in the ballroom.

23:46.552 --> 23:49.346
I've got this incredible DJ
who's gonna play at the party.

23:49.429 --> 23:52.724
That's if you don't mind springing for it.

23:53.934 --> 23:55.185
Whatever you need, Doc.

23:56.395 --> 23:58.730
Great. All right. See you in a bit.

23:58.814 --> 24:00.983
Wait, Isaac, I need a minute.

24:01.984 --> 24:04.486
Kids, you're doing great.
Keep going. Work together.

24:07.990 --> 24:11.869
I got a call from Rabbi Goldberg
of the Madison congregation,

24:11.952 --> 24:13.537
-about you.
-About me?

24:13.620 --> 24:15.998
Actually,
it was on behalf of a Phyllis Shapiro.

24:16.081 --> 24:17.082
Do you know who that is?

24:17.833 --> 24:20.419
-I don't.
-I think that's Marty's sister.

24:23.714 --> 24:25.465
What was she inquiring about?

24:25.549 --> 24:28.635
You. Your reputation inside our building.

24:28.719 --> 24:31.555
And if you've ever done a bar mitzvah
for a patient before.

24:32.097 --> 24:33.682
I didn't know Marty was a patient.

24:33.765 --> 24:35.475
Just thought he was a friend.

24:36.351 --> 24:40.105
Yeah, Marty's a--
Marty's a patient of mine.

24:41.064 --> 24:44.151
And what we're doing for him,
what you are doing for him,

24:45.110 --> 24:46.820
is a "therapeutic-mitzvah."

24:47.654 --> 24:54.578
This man has been held back
his entire life by his 13th birthday.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.751
How many people do you have coming?

25:02.836 --> 25:03.879
A lot. Like…

25:03.962 --> 25:05.506
Do you have an exact number?

25:06.256 --> 25:07.799
Around a hundred, I think.

25:07.883 --> 25:08.884
Wow.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.219
You?

25:11.053 --> 25:13.514
Yeah. I think-- I mean-- We'll see.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.518
-People have busy schedules and stuff.
-Yeah.

25:17.601 --> 25:18.602
…he's with me.

25:18.685 --> 25:19.686
God loves him.

25:20.354 --> 25:21.855
He tell you that himself?

25:27.110 --> 25:29.029
All right. Let's go with…

25:39.456 --> 25:40.457
Marty.

25:41.250 --> 25:42.584
-Hey.
-A minute?

25:43.418 --> 25:44.586
Of course. What's up?

25:48.173 --> 25:49.216
Have a seat.

25:50.801 --> 25:51.844
All right.

25:55.305 --> 25:58.308
Your sister is Phyllis, right?
Phyllis Shapiro?

25:59.017 --> 26:00.060
Yes. Why?

26:01.395 --> 26:02.729
What kind of person is she, Marty?

26:04.439 --> 26:07.276
I know you've mentioned
her hitting a rough patch as of late,

26:07.359 --> 26:09.278
but does she have some kind of agenda?

26:10.904 --> 26:12.197
I don't understand.

26:12.281 --> 26:13.740
Does she have a history of mental illness?

26:13.824 --> 26:16.243
Has she ever been treated
for any chemical imbalance?

26:16.326 --> 26:17.411
-Anything like that?
-No.

26:17.494 --> 26:20.873
I'm just trying to get a sense
of who she is while I register my alarm.

26:20.956 --> 26:23.667
See, my psychiatrist radar is going off.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.878
Why? What do you mean?

26:25.961 --> 26:29.006
Well, apparently she's been
asking around about me.

26:30.299 --> 26:34.178
Called the temple to check my reputation,
see if I was trustworthy.

26:34.261 --> 26:37.014
-What?
-Me, Dr. Isaac Herschkopf,

26:37.097 --> 26:39.016
board of NYU medical school.

26:39.099 --> 26:41.393
Oh, my God. Dr. Herschkopf,
I don't know what to say.

26:41.476 --> 26:46.523
As a physician,
we all swear an oath to first do no harm.

26:46.607 --> 26:50.527
It's an oath that I took, and take,
very seriously.

26:50.611 --> 26:54.865
So when someone questions
my good character, it hurts.

26:55.532 --> 26:58.410
-It really hurts.
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry--

26:58.493 --> 27:02.164
My reputation is all I have.
I've worked very hard for it.

27:02.247 --> 27:04.124
-Ask anyone. It's unassailable.
-No, I know.

27:04.208 --> 27:06.001
You're the very best there is.

27:06.084 --> 27:07.252
I'm worried, Marty.

27:07.336 --> 27:09.671
I'm worried this sister
doesn't want what's best for you.

27:09.755 --> 27:13.008
But she's the one that suggested
I try therapy in the first place.

27:13.091 --> 27:16.094
I know that, but does she really
wanna see you grow and change,

27:16.178 --> 27:18.514
or would she rather
keep you frozen in time?

27:19.056 --> 27:21.934
People like this are not ready
to do the work themselves.

27:22.017 --> 27:24.770
So when they see you grow,
it's very threatening to them.

27:24.853 --> 27:28.857
-But I think she wants what's best for me.
-Then why is she trying to sabotage it?

27:30.817 --> 27:36.615
Marty, trust is at the very core
of who I am and what I do.

27:36.698 --> 27:37.991
It has to be.

27:38.075 --> 27:43.747
Without trust, I am nothing.
Without trust, we have nothing.

27:48.252 --> 27:51.296
I do trust you. I trust you completely.

27:52.506 --> 27:54.716
I'll talk to her. I will.
I'll talk to her.

27:54.800 --> 27:55.884
I promise.

28:12.067 --> 28:13.902
Give me a break, Daniel.

28:13.986 --> 28:16.238
No, don't talk to me
about your upper west--

28:17.698 --> 28:18.949
I need to talk to you.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.617
-What are you doing?
-Now.

28:22.536 --> 28:25.789
If this is one of your
"at work, we work" lectures,

28:25.873 --> 28:27.040
I can't hear y--

28:27.124 --> 28:28.917
-I can't handle that now.
-You called his rabbi?

28:29.001 --> 28:30.169
-What?
-Dr. Ike.

28:30.252 --> 28:31.253
You called his rabbi.

28:31.336 --> 28:33.881
What are you doing snooping around
about him?

28:33.964 --> 28:35.716
Is that what you're upset about?

28:35.799 --> 28:39.761
I-- Marty, I'm not snooping.
I'm looking out for you.

28:39.845 --> 28:42.931
You embarrassed me, Phyllis.
He's very upset.

28:43.015 --> 28:45.976
Well, I don't care about him, Marty.
I care about you.

28:46.059 --> 28:47.060
Do you? Really?

28:47.144 --> 28:49.855
I'm your sister. That's my literal job.

28:51.982 --> 28:54.026
Marty, take a step back for a second.

28:54.109 --> 28:56.361
What-- "Run to the light, Carol Anne."

28:56.445 --> 28:57.988
You sound deranged.

28:58.071 --> 29:00.949
You really don't think
that this is a weird suggestion

29:01.033 --> 29:02.576
for a therapist to make?

29:05.871 --> 29:07.456
He's trying to help me.

29:07.539 --> 29:08.957
But it crosses a line.

29:09.041 --> 29:10.709
Says who? You?

29:11.335 --> 29:12.544
I tell you what I think.

29:12.628 --> 29:17.382
I think that you see that I'm changing
and that you're threatened by it.

29:18.509 --> 29:20.385
You think that? Or does he?

29:20.469 --> 29:22.513
You told me to do this, Phyllis!

29:22.596 --> 29:26.808
I told you to talk to somebody,
not redo your 13th birthday.

29:28.310 --> 29:29.978
Well, I'm doing it. Okay?

29:31.104 --> 29:32.105
Okay.

29:33.148 --> 29:34.691
Whatever, Marty. Fine.

29:34.775 --> 29:37.611
And if you can't be supportive,
don't come.

29:39.029 --> 29:40.822
So now you're actually 13.

29:40.906 --> 29:42.699
If you don't believe in it,
I don't want you there.

29:42.783 --> 29:44.868
-Do you want me to lie to you?
-No.

29:46.495 --> 29:49.122
I don't believe in it.
I think it's ridiculous.

29:49.748 --> 29:51.083
-Ridiculous?
-I do.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.459
-Good. Okay.
-Fine.

29:52.543 --> 29:54.211
So don't come, okay?

29:54.294 --> 29:57.214
Even if you change your mind. Don't come.

29:57.297 --> 29:58.298
Marty.

29:59.132 --> 30:00.133
Fine!

30:01.385 --> 30:03.679
What a special day.

30:04.304 --> 30:06.557
Welcome to our b'nai mitzvah.

30:06.640 --> 30:10.477
And to all their family and friends
who, today, will witness

30:10.561 --> 30:15.899
Emily begin her life
as a fully participating Jewish adult.

30:16.650 --> 30:17.651
And Marty.

30:18.986 --> 30:23.407
Marty, who shall continue to do just that.

30:27.411 --> 30:29.079
The first aliyah.

33:22.503 --> 33:23.504
Bravo!

33:27.966 --> 33:28.800
Yeah.

33:28.884 --> 33:29.885
Mazel.

33:30.928 --> 33:32.596
Mazel tov, mazel tov.

33:33.472 --> 33:35.307
-Mazel tov. Let's party.
-Yeah.

33:35.390 --> 33:36.558
-Yeah.
-Yes.

34:03.085 --> 34:04.670
Yeah! All right!

34:13.469 --> 34:15.597
Anything to say to the bar mitzvah boy?

34:17.349 --> 34:20.268
Well, I am the bar mitzvah boy,

34:20.351 --> 34:23.105
-but if I did have something I'd wanna--
-Sorry, I--

34:23.188 --> 34:24.188
Hey, mazel tov.

34:34.824 --> 34:35.826
Phyllis.

34:41.164 --> 34:42.623
Excuse me, Marty?

34:43.833 --> 34:45.627
I'm Bonnie. Ike's wife.

34:45.710 --> 34:48.880
Bonnie! Oh, my gosh. Hi.

34:48.964 --> 34:50.132
-Hi.
-Hello.

34:50.799 --> 34:54.928
Well, I saw you standing alone,
and I'm not great at these things either.

34:55.012 --> 34:57.054
It is such a pleasure to meet you.

34:57.890 --> 35:00.184
Your husband. What a great guy.

35:00.267 --> 35:03.228
He's a great guy, yes.

35:03.312 --> 35:05.647
Not necessarily a great dancer.

35:06.231 --> 35:08.984
I haven't seen him have this much fun
since our wedding.

35:09.735 --> 35:13.113
He's really enjoying himself.
He sure has a lot of friends.

35:13.197 --> 35:14.865
Yeah, he does.

35:15.699 --> 35:18.035
It's time!

35:23.040 --> 35:26.877
Hava nagila, hava nagila

35:26.960 --> 35:30.923
Hava nagila ve-nis'mecha

35:31.006 --> 35:34.843
Hava nagila, hava nagila

35:35.427 --> 35:36.803
Get out there, Marty!

35:37.304 --> 35:38.347
Marty?

35:38.847 --> 35:41.850
Hava neranena, hava neranena

35:52.194 --> 35:54.238
Marty. Marty, what's going on?

35:55.113 --> 35:56.365
I gotta use the bathroom.

35:56.448 --> 35:58.825
-We're all out there waiting for you.
-No, I know.

35:58.909 --> 36:00.327
I just gotta…

36:02.287 --> 36:03.288
My tummy hurts.

36:03.872 --> 36:04.873
Marty.

36:06.041 --> 36:08.502
This is it, Mar-- The hard part's over.

36:08.585 --> 36:11.421
-Now it's time to enjoy yourself.
-I know. Just…

36:15.467 --> 36:19.346
Marty.
I'm not even sure those issues are real.

36:19.429 --> 36:23.058
No, it's real. Yeah.
It's a real bad flare-up.

36:23.141 --> 36:24.893
I have known you several weeks now,

36:24.977 --> 36:28.480
and I have seen nothing to suggest
you have digestive problems.

36:29.731 --> 36:33.402
Let me free you of a lie that everyone,
including your sister, including you,

36:33.485 --> 36:36.029
has been perpetuating for 30 years.

36:36.780 --> 36:38.782
There's nothing wrong with you.

36:39.575 --> 36:41.785
Little boys have digestive issues.

36:41.869 --> 36:44.288
Real men take shits.

36:44.872 --> 36:46.123
Now, come on.

36:47.624 --> 36:48.709
It's time.

36:58.719 --> 36:59.720
Well…

37:03.432 --> 37:04.433
I'll speak for your uncle

37:04.516 --> 37:07.227
when I say that he's sorry
he couldn't be here tonight.

37:12.191 --> 37:13.400
Very, very sorry.

37:20.199 --> 37:21.825
But that's what family is, huh?

37:24.328 --> 37:27.372
It's a collection of people
that you owe an apology to.

38:08.080 --> 38:12.334
Sometimes the people that we love
do things that we don't agree with.

38:13.335 --> 38:15.754
Sometimes they act
like fucking douchebags.

38:15.838 --> 38:16.922
Pardon my French.

38:19.466 --> 38:20.467
Now let's eat.

38:23.095 --> 38:27.432
One, two, three.
