10:02.036 --> 10:04.604
I WAS INVITED BY THE F.B.I.
THEY SAID YOU NEED HELP.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.649
OH...

10:09.565 --> 10:10.740
YOU'RE A PSYCHIC.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.742
SO I'M TOLD.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.309
[laughs]

10:14.352 --> 10:16.180
ALL RIGHT.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.008
[keys jangle]

10:19.793 --> 10:21.664
READ MY PALM.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.885
IT ONLY WORKS
WITH A DOMINANT HAND.

10:30.107 --> 10:31.805
NO. CAN'T DO IT.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.894
I KNEW YOU WERE A FAKE.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.547
NO, YOU'RE NOT
LETTING ME IN.

10:35.591 --> 10:38.202
YOU'RE ANXIOUS ABOUT
FINDING YOUR HUSBAND,

10:38.246 --> 10:40.944
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE READ
BY A GORGER FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.077
YOU'RE FEELING SCARED
AND ALONE...[sighs]

10:43.120 --> 10:44.948
[curtains slide open]AND YOU DON'T TRUST
STRANGERS.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.734
AND I DON'T BLAME YOU.
YOU CAN'T TRUST THESE GUYS.JANE.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.474
I MEAN, THEY MEAN WELL,

10:49.518 --> 10:52.521
AND THEY'LL FIND YOUR HUSBAND
IF YOU LET THEM DO THEIR THING.

10:52.564 --> 10:55.306
SAYS YOU.YES, SAYS ME.

10:55.350 --> 10:59.006
WHY ARE YOU ASKING THE F.B.I.
TO MEET YOUR SPIRITUAL NEEDS?

10:59.049 --> 11:00.964
DON'T YOU HAVE A TRUSTED
PSYCHIC OF YOUR OWN?

11:01.008 --> 11:03.097
I DO. CLEO.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.142
BUT HE'S NOT ANSWERING
MY PHONE CALLS.

11:05.186 --> 11:07.754
HMM. THAT IS ODD.

11:07.797 --> 11:10.147
CAN YOU FIND HIM?
CAN YOU FIND ABEL?

11:10.191 --> 11:11.975
WHERE WAS THE LAST PLACE
YOU SAW HIM?

11:12.019 --> 11:14.282
ON THE ROOF,
NIGHT BEFORE LAST.

11:14.325 --> 11:15.762
WHAT WERE YOU DOING UP THERE?

11:15.805 --> 11:19.243
SHARING A BOTTLE OF WINE
WITH MY GIRLFRIENDS.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.811
ABEL CAME UP THERE
WITH HIS LAPTOP.

11:21.855 --> 11:25.119
HE LIKES TO UNWIND ON THE ROOF.
IT'S PEACEFUL.

11:25.162 --> 11:28.688
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS ROOF.

11:28.731 --> 11:31.038
[door creaks]

11:32.866 --> 11:35.956
IT'S THE STAIRS
AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY.

11:38.175 --> 11:40.177
HI.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.831
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:41.875 --> 11:44.007
SPYHOLE WENT DARK.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.706
[chain clattering]

11:48.751 --> 11:49.883
WHAT?

11:49.926 --> 11:51.841
WE'RE WITH THE F.B.I.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.713
SIR, DID YOU SEE OR HEAR
ANYTHING UNUSUAL

11:53.756 --> 11:55.236
IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS?

11:55.279 --> 11:56.846
I ALREADY TOLD YOU PEOPLE,
NO.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.195
WE'RE WITH
A DIFFERENT OFFICE.

11:58.239 --> 12:01.808
[sighs] SO MANY,
LIKE ROACHES.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.418
[lock clicks, chain clatters]

12:03.461 --> 12:05.028
NICE GUY.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.552
HIS NAME IS NGUYEN HAI.
HE'S A VIETNAMESE REFUGEE.

12:07.596 --> 12:10.338
HE USED TO RUN A NOODLE SHOP.
NOW HE OWNS THE BUILDING.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.992
HE WAS HOME THE EVENING
OF THE DISAPPEARANCE,

12:12.035 --> 12:13.515
BUT HE DIDN'T HEAR OR SEE
ANYTHING.

12:13.558 --> 12:14.995
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

12:15.038 --> 12:16.736
I READ THE CASE FILES.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.476
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
INTERESTED IN THE CASE.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.261
IT WAS A LONG PLANE RIDE.

12:28.399 --> 12:31.228
SO IF ABEL CAME UP HERE
THE NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED,

12:31.272 --> 12:33.143
WHY WAS THE BEDROOM TRASHED?

12:33.187 --> 12:36.712
I DON'T KNOW. I GOT HOME
LATE FROM THE BAR.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.020
WHEN I GOT IN, ABEL WAS GONE,
AND OUR ROOM WAS WRECKED.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.326
WAS HE EXPECTING
ANY VISITORS?

12:42.370 --> 12:44.894
[Defiance] I DON'T THINK SO.

12:44.938 --> 12:47.418
HE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME
BEFORE I LEFT.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.420
THIS IS
YOUR HUSBAND'S GARDEN.

12:50.944 --> 12:54.077
YEAH. HOW'D YOU KNOW?

12:54.121 --> 12:56.645
HIS ENERGY'S HERE.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.821
HE POURS HIS ENERGY
INTO THIS GARDEN

12:58.865 --> 13:00.997
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE BEING
A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.259
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.348
HE FEELS TRAPPED
IN THAT WORLD.

13:04.392 --> 13:05.828
YES.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.396
IT'S AN ORDERLY WORLD,

13:08.439 --> 13:10.833
FULL OF RULES AND NUMBERS.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.617
BUT IT'S NOT ABEL'S WORLD.

13:12.661 --> 13:15.098
HE SEES HIMSELF MORE
AS A REBEL SOUL.

13:15.142 --> 13:16.578
[clicks tongue]

13:16.621 --> 13:18.362
HE REALLY LOVES THAT
CHE GUEVARA GUY.

13:18.406 --> 13:20.756
YEAH, THAT'S WHY HE RIDES
A MOTORCYCLE.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.280
GROWS HIS OWN VEGETABLES.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.239
THAT'S WHY HE MARRIED YOU.

13:25.282 --> 13:26.806
OH, BECAUSE I'M A GYPSY?

13:26.849 --> 13:28.633
YEAH.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.635
BECAUSE YOU HAD THE COURAGE
TO WALK AWAY FROM

13:30.679 --> 13:33.943
CENTURIES OF TRADITION
FOR LOVE.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.727
YOU MAY NOT KNOW IT,
BUT YOU GIVE YOUR HUSBAND

13:35.771 --> 13:38.818
THE COURAGE TO BE WHO HE IS
ON THE INSIDE.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.994
IS ABEL ALIVE?

13:45.172 --> 13:47.522
WHY DON'T YOU HELP ME
FIND HIM?

13:48.523 --> 13:51.482
[inhales and exhales]

13:51.526 --> 13:52.962
I CAN FEEL HIM.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.964
WHERE IS HE?

13:55.008 --> 13:57.662
JUST NOT GETTING
A CLEAR READ.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.621
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

14:00.796 --> 14:03.668
WELL...[gasps]

14:03.712 --> 14:06.410
DON'T TELL THEM
I SAID THIS,

14:06.454 --> 14:09.326
BUT YOU SHOULD SNEAK OFF
AND NOTIFY THE MEDIA RIGHT AWAY.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.154
HMM?OKAY.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.853
SO THAT THIS CITY CAN PULL
TOGETHER AND HELP FIND HIM.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.855
THAT IS YOUR ONLY HOPE

14:15.898 --> 14:19.336
AT SAVING
YOUR HUSBAND'S LIFE.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.511
OKAY.

14:20.555 --> 14:21.773
GO.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.432
WHERE'S SHE GOING?

14:28.476 --> 14:31.348
SHE, UH... WANTS TO CALL
THE PRESS.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.046
I-I-I TRIED TO STOP HER.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.048
DOWNSTAIRS.

14:38.616 --> 14:41.184
YOU MUST REALLY MISS
THAT PRISON CELL.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.667
[Patrick] I'LL TRY
AND TALK TO HER.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.756
YOU HAVE DONE
ENOUGH TALKING.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.065
[lock clicks, chain clatters]

14:53.327 --> 14:55.895
HI.[door slams]

14:59.072 --> 15:00.595
[door creaks]

15:25.794 --> 15:27.361
[phones ringing]

15:27.404 --> 15:28.928
AFTER JANE RETURNED
TO THE ROOF,

15:28.971 --> 15:30.973
HE WENT DOWN A FIRE ESCAPE
TO THE SOUTH ALLEY.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.583
[monitor beeps]

15:32.627 --> 15:34.324
AND THAT'S WHERE THE CAMERAS
LOSE SIGHT OF HIM.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.239
WHO WAS COVERING
THE SOUTH EXIT?

15:36.283 --> 15:39.460
I WAS. BUT I DIDN'T HAVE
A LINE OF SIGHT TO THE ALLEY.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.897
THERE ARE NO EXITS THERE,
SO I DIDN'T THINK--

15:41.941 --> 15:44.378
YOU MISREAD THE SITUATION.
THERE'LL BE A NOTE IN YOUR FILE.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.164
YES, MA'AM.

15:48.208 --> 15:51.211
COLLINS WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
TO MISREAD THE SITUATION.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.908
YOU MEAN ME?

15:52.952 --> 15:53.996
YEAH.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.738
YOU'RE CORRECT.
I SCREWED UP, TOO.

15:56.781 --> 16:00.481
AND SUPERVISING AGENT ABBOTT
WILL NOTE THAT IN MYFILE.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.091
FAIR ENOUGH.

16:02.135 --> 16:05.399
WHY DON'T YOU AND AGENT COLLINS
FOCUS ON LOOKING FOR JANE?

16:05.442 --> 16:07.096
YOU HAVE AN INSIGHT THERE.

16:07.140 --> 16:10.273
COORDINATE WITH DAVIS
IN THE NEW YORK OFFICE.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.492
YES, MA'AM.

16:11.535 --> 16:12.623
THANK YOU.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.626
THIS IS THE REAL YOU, HUH?

16:15.670 --> 16:18.325
LET'S KEEP OUR EYES
ON THE PRIZE, SHALL WE?

16:18.368 --> 16:19.630
ABEL SCHNEIDERMAN.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.415
WE HAVE NARROWED
HIS KIDNAPPING SUSPECTS...

16:21.458 --> 16:24.244
EXCUSE ME?TO THREE EXTREMIST GROUPS--

16:25.680 --> 16:27.290
WHY AM I HERE?

16:27.334 --> 16:28.422
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:28.465 --> 16:30.467
I HAVE NO BUSINESS.
JANE'S GONE.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.469
WE'LL FIND HIM.

16:32.513 --> 16:35.081
UH, MOST OF YOU WILL
RECOGNIZE THESE FACES.

16:35.124 --> 16:37.518
YOU'RE ONLY GONNA FIND HIM
IF HE WANTS TO BE FOUND,

16:37.561 --> 16:39.694
WHICH HE DOESN'T, OR HE WOULDN'T
HAVE LEFT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.610
TAKE FIVE.

16:42.653 --> 16:45.656
[murmuring]

16:52.098 --> 16:55.057
[sighs] TELL ME SOMETHING.
UH...

16:55.101 --> 16:56.798
DID YOU HELP JANE ESCAPE?

16:56.841 --> 16:59.148
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

16:59.192 --> 17:01.542
YOU'RE H-HIS FRIEND.

17:01.585 --> 17:04.675
YES, I AM, BUT I'M ALSO
AN OFFICER OF THE LAW.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.243
I'M NOT TRYING TO GET YOU
IN TROUBLE. I JUST...

17:09.550 --> 17:11.682
[sighs] I NEED YOUR HELP.

17:11.726 --> 17:15.077
I... [sighs]

17:15.121 --> 17:18.733
I WAS SO CERTAIN
I HAD HIM FIGURED OUT.

17:18.776 --> 17:19.821
[sighs]

17:19.864 --> 17:22.911
WELCOME TO MY LIFE.

17:22.954 --> 17:26.436
HOW DID YOU MAKE IT WORK
FOR SO LONG?

17:26.480 --> 17:29.439
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
MYSELF.

17:29.483 --> 17:32.051
I MEAN, AFTER HE DISAPPEARED.

17:32.094 --> 17:34.314
HOW I MADE IT WORK
FOR SO LONG.

17:34.357 --> 17:36.011
AND WHAT'S THE ANSWER?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.796
I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.582
WERE YOU TWO EVER INVOLVED?

17:42.757 --> 17:45.847
THAT'S A STRANGE QUESTION.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.979
WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME THAT?

17:48.023 --> 17:50.330
UH...

17:50.373 --> 17:52.071
NO REASON. I JUST--I...

17:54.160 --> 17:57.076

I.T. SUPPORT

19:46.924 --> 19:48.448

19:50.537 --> 19:54.193
SO I STOLE SOME SATELLITE TIME

19:56.717 --> 19:58.153

20:07.771 --> 20:09.904
YOU THINK IT'S REALLY JANE?
IT'S NOT A TRICK?

YOU CATS FIND THE BODY YET?

22:27.868 --> 22:30.087
[cell door closes]

22:30.131 --> 22:31.698
WHAT BODY?

22:31.741 --> 22:35.005
THE BODY HIDDEN ON THE ROOF
OF ABEL SCHNEIDERMAN'S BUILDING.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.356
YOU SAW IT?

22:37.399 --> 22:39.358
NO, BUT THERE'S A LARGE
PILE OF SOIL

22:39.401 --> 22:40.924
JUST BY THE GARDEN.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.187
[cell door closes in distance]WINTER IS ALMOST UPON US,

22:43.231 --> 22:45.146
SO WHAT IS THAT SOIL
DOING THERE?

22:45.189 --> 22:47.583
THAT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.846
THE SOIL IS THERE
TO MAKE ROOM FOR CLEO--

22:49.890 --> 22:51.370
MRS. SCHNEIDERMAN'S PSYCHIC.

22:51.413 --> 22:54.024
HE WENT MISSING
THE SAME TIME AS HER HUSBAND.

22:54.068 --> 22:55.504
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

22:55.548 --> 22:58.246
ABEL FOUND OUT HIS WIFE
WAS SLEEPING WITH HER PSYCHIC,

22:58.289 --> 22:59.856
SO HE KILLED HIM
IN THE BEDROOM.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.859
BUT ABEL DOESN'T OWN A CAR,
SO HE CUT UP THE BODY

23:02.903 --> 23:05.775
INTO PIECES AND BURIED THEM
IN THE GARDEN.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.691
YOUR KIDNAP VICTIM
ISN'T KIDNAPPED.

23:08.735 --> 23:11.128
HE'S A KILLER.
AND HE'S ON THE RUN.

23:13.261 --> 23:14.871
YOU'RE GOOD.

23:14.915 --> 23:16.264
THANK YOU.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.788
A GOOD LIAR.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.573
EH...

23:25.882 --> 23:27.841
[door opens and creaks]

23:27.884 --> 23:29.103
[flashlight clicks]

23:30.496 --> 23:32.889
I REALLY HOPE THIS ISN'T
HIS IDEA OF A JOKE.

23:33.890 --> 23:35.152
THERE IS THAT CHANCE.

23:37.067 --> 23:39.766
THERE'S ALSO THE CHANCE
THAT HE'S RIGHT.

23:41.245 --> 23:45.075
IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT THIS JOB KILLS INSIDE,

23:45.119 --> 23:47.034
IT'S A SENSE OF TRUST.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.428
[knocks]

23:49.471 --> 23:51.778
I ALMOST FORGOT
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

23:53.954 --> 23:56.347
[knocking]

23:56.391 --> 23:57.958
[knocking continues]

23:58.001 --> 24:00.090
HEY, LET ME GET SOME LIGHT
OVER HERE.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.885
WELL, THERE WE GO.

24:23.984 --> 24:25.812
HEY.

24:25.855 --> 24:27.204
HEY.

24:27.248 --> 24:28.945
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY GAVE ME A DESK.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.381
[laughs]

24:31.644 --> 24:33.472
YOU CAN CALL ME "THE COYOTE."

24:33.515 --> 24:35.604
I DON'T THINK SO.

24:35.648 --> 24:37.519
THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY
CALL ME DOWNSTAIRS.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.042
DON'T ASK ME WHY, THOUGH.
THEY NEVER TOLD ME.

24:39.086 --> 24:41.871
[laughs]

24:41.915 --> 24:43.525
YOUR NAME'S WYLIE.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.309
YEAH.

24:48.269 --> 24:49.531
WILE E. COYOTE.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.315
"ROAD RUNNER," THE CARTOON?

24:52.360 --> 24:54.493
NO, IT'S IRISH, I THINK.

24:56.756 --> 24:59.062
UH, GOOD MORNING,
AGENT STANLEY.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.630
HEY...

25:01.674 --> 25:03.719
DO YOU KNOW THE ROAD RUNNER
AND THE COYOTE?

25:03.763 --> 25:06.287
YEAH. SEX TRAFFICKERS
IN DALLAS.

25:10.334 --> 25:12.511
[whispering] THERE'S A CARTOON
ABOUT SEX TRAFFICKING?

25:13.816 --> 25:15.775
HEY, CHO, YOU GOT A MINUTE?

25:15.818 --> 25:17.211
YEAH.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.785
ABBOTT AND I WENT
TO BROOKLYN LAST NIGHT.

25:25.828 --> 25:27.438
THERE WAS A BODY
HIDDEN ON THE ROOF.

25:27.482 --> 25:28.527
JANE WAS RIGHT.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.006
HE USUALLY IS.
YOU GET AN I.D.?

25:30.050 --> 25:32.226
WE'RE WAITING ON FORENSICS,
BUT IT APPEARS TO BE

25:32.269 --> 25:35.316
MRS. SCHNEIDERMAN'S PSYCHIC,
JUST LIKE JANE SAID.

25:35.359 --> 25:37.318
THE DIRECTOR WANTS ME TO
BRING HIM BACK ON THE CASE.

25:37.361 --> 25:38.667
THAT'S A GOOD CALL.

25:38.711 --> 25:40.190
HE MADE FOOLS OF US.

25:40.234 --> 25:42.758
IT WON'T BE
THE LAST TIME.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.847
HOW DO I GET HIM UNDER CONTROL?

25:44.891 --> 25:47.371
[sighs] YOU DON'T.
JANE IS WHAT HE IS.

25:47.415 --> 25:50.026
HE'LL USE YOU TO TURN EVERY
SITUATION TO HIS ADVANTAGE.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.854
SO WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST
I DO?

25:51.898 --> 25:53.552
USE HIM TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

25:54.901 --> 25:57.904
[phones ringing,
indistinct conversations]

25:59.645 --> 26:02.604
FOUND THE BODY?[Fischer] YES.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.606
CLEO ASCENCIO,
NEW YORK PSYCHIC,

26:04.650 --> 26:06.390
ASTROLOGER, HEALER.

26:06.434 --> 26:09.393
ALSO FOUND A HACKSAW
HIDDEN IN THE PLANTERS,

26:09.437 --> 26:11.091
SAME BRAND AS THE OTHER TOOLS
IN ABEL'S KIT,

26:11.134 --> 26:12.875
WITH TRACES
OF THE VICTIM'S BLOOD.

26:12.919 --> 26:15.225
SO ABEL KILLED HIS WIFE'S LOVER
AND RAN AWAY,

26:15.269 --> 26:17.837
JUST... LIKE I SAID.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.187
WELL, IT APPEARS SO.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.276
OH. DON'T BEAT YOURSELVES UP.

26:22.319 --> 26:23.756
YOU WOULD HAVE FIGURED IT OUT
EVENTUALLY.

26:25.061 --> 26:27.673
I SAID, "APPEARS SO."

26:27.716 --> 26:30.240
HE JUST RECEIVED A RANSOM NOTE.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.851
A THIRD-CLASS LETTER
SENT DIRECTLY

26:31.894 --> 26:33.374
TO ABEL SCHNEIDERMAN'S OFFICE.

26:33.417 --> 26:35.855
WHAT KIND OF KIDNAPPER
USES SNAIL MAIL?

26:35.898 --> 26:37.639
IT'S SMART, REALLY.

26:37.683 --> 26:41.121
LOW-TECH, OLD SCHOOL,
NO ELECTRONIC FOOTPRINT.

26:41.164 --> 26:44.211
UNIDENTIFIED KIDNAPPERS
WANT $10 MILLION

26:44.254 --> 26:46.300
DEPOSITED INTO AN OVERSEAS
ACCOUNT BY MIDNIGHT,

26:46.343 --> 26:48.563
OR THEY WILL SELL SCHNEIDERMAN
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.043
NEXT STEP WOULD BE
A CYBER-ATTACK

26:50.086 --> 26:51.479
ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.133
YOU WANT ME TO NOTIFY
SECRET SERVICE?PLEASE DO.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.353
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

26:56.397 --> 26:59.095
THERE ARE NO KIDNAPPERS.

26:59.139 --> 27:00.793
WHAT AM I MISSING?

27:00.836 --> 27:02.272
MAYBE ABEL FAKED
HIS OWN KIDNAPPING

27:02.316 --> 27:03.796
TO GET MONEY
TO ESCAPE THE COUNTRY.

27:03.839 --> 27:06.146
THAT'S VERY GOOD, LISBON.
THAT IS THE BEST THEORY YET,

27:06.189 --> 27:07.669
BUT IT'S WRONG, TOO.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.758
I NEED ANOTHER LOOK
AT THAT LOFT.

27:09.802 --> 27:12.326
REALLY?
BACK TO BROOKLYN AGAIN?

27:12.369 --> 27:14.284
YEAH.

27:18.288 --> 27:19.289
OKAY.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.248
DON'T WORRY. I WON'T ESCAPE.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.598
OH, I'M NOT WORRIED.
IF YOU WALK AWAY THIS TIME--

27:23.642 --> 27:26.427
I KNOW. I'LL END UP SPENDING
THE REST OF MY LIFE IN PRISON.

27:26.470 --> 27:27.776
[chuckles] NO.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.473
I'LL SHOOT YOU.

27:29.517 --> 27:30.736
MM.

27:37.046 --> 27:39.048
OH, LOOK, THEY HAVE
"SkyMall."

27:40.702 --> 27:42.399
"SkyMall."

27:45.359 --> 27:48.492
[moans and sighs]

27:50.625 --> 27:52.192
[sighs]

27:56.892 --> 27:58.633
OKAY, LISBON,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.200
YOU.

28:00.243 --> 28:02.637
WAS IT THAT COMMENT
I MADE IN THE BULLPEN?

28:02.681 --> 28:04.334
BECAUSE I THINK
IT'S A REALLY GOOD THEORY.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.685
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

28:06.728 --> 28:09.078
YOU RAN AWAY AGAIN, JANE.

28:09.122 --> 28:10.906
NOT FROM THE F.B.I.
YOU RAN AWAY FROM ME.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.473
YEAH, BUT I RAN BACK.

28:12.516 --> 28:14.214
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW?

28:14.257 --> 28:16.085
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONE AGAIN FOREVER.

28:25.878 --> 28:27.923
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I-I'M SORRY, LISBON.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.708
I... I DIDN'T THINK
ABOUT YOU.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.448
WELL, YOU RARELY DO.

28:31.492 --> 28:34.451
WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

28:34.495 --> 28:37.019
I MADE YOU ONE OF MY DEMANDS.
I'M--I'M NOT JOINING THE F.B.I.

28:37.063 --> 28:38.586
UNLESS THEY MAKE YOU
A JOB OFFER.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.544
THAT'S MY POINT.

28:40.588 --> 28:43.547
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I WANT
TO WORK WITH YOU AGAIN?

28:43.591 --> 28:45.724
YOU ARE DIFFICULT
AND EXHAUSTING,

28:45.767 --> 28:47.377
AND MAYBE I DON'T WANT
TO PUT THE REST OF MY LIFE

28:47.421 --> 28:49.728
ON HOLD TO BE YOUR SIDEKICK.[sighs]

28:49.771 --> 28:51.730
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?

28:51.773 --> 28:53.035
NO... NO.

28:53.079 --> 28:54.645
I HADN'T CONSIDERED IT.

28:54.689 --> 28:57.257
YOU THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR MY LIFE,

28:57.300 --> 29:00.260
BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
A PART OF MY LIFE FOR TWO YEARS.

29:04.220 --> 29:07.571
SO LET'S GET THIS CASE
WRAPPED UP SO I CAN GO HOME.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.576
HOW DARE YOU THINK
THAT I WOULD CHEAT ON ABEL!

29:12.620 --> 29:14.361
AND WITH CLEO?!

29:14.404 --> 29:17.494
NO, I-I WASN'T READING YOU.
I WAS READING YOUR HUSBAND.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.758
YOU'RE A CATCH.
YOUR HUSBAND'S A COMPUTER NERD

29:19.801 --> 29:22.586
PRETENDING TO BE A REBEL
TO TRY AND HANG ON TO YOU.

29:22.630 --> 29:25.024
MEN LIKE THAT SNAP
WHEN THEY FEEL BETRAYED.

29:25.067 --> 29:28.288
IT'S TRUE.
ABEL IS VERY JEALOUS

29:28.331 --> 29:31.073
AND INSECURE
AND HE OVERCOMPENSATES,

29:31.117 --> 29:33.989
BUT YOU MISSED ONE DETAIL.

29:34.033 --> 29:36.209
YOU'RE IN LOVE.

29:36.252 --> 29:38.080
HE'S MY LITTLE LION,

29:38.124 --> 29:40.779
AND I WOULD NEVER SLEEP
WITH ANOTHER MAN.

29:40.822 --> 29:43.172
I SEE THAT NOW.

29:46.132 --> 29:48.264
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ALONE.ALL RIGHT.

29:48.308 --> 29:49.657
PLEASE LEAVE.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.572
OKAY.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.226
[clears throat]

29:53.269 --> 29:55.097
DO YOU STILL THINK
ABEL KILLED CLEO?

29:55.141 --> 29:57.230
OH, I KNOW HE DID.
GUY'S A HOTHEAD.

29:57.273 --> 29:59.885
THOSE SWOLLEN BICEPS
AND NECK TATTOOS.

29:59.928 --> 30:02.801
THE MERE HINT OF AN AFFAIR
WOULD SET THAT GUY OFF.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.281
WHY WAS HER PSYCHIC HERE
THE NIGHT ABEL DISAPPEARED?

30:05.325 --> 30:06.935
DEFIANCE WAS OUT
WITH HER FRIENDS ALL NIGHT.

30:06.979 --> 30:08.763
THERE WAS NO REASON FOR HIM
TO BE AT THE LOFT.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.027
CLEO ASCENCIO.
IT'S SUCH A THEATRICAL NAME.

30:12.071 --> 30:13.637
YOU THINK IT'S REAL?

30:13.681 --> 30:14.943
IT IS.
WE RAN HIS FINGERPRINTS.

30:14.987 --> 30:17.467
LET ME GUESS.
CLEAN RECORD?SPOTLESS.

30:17.511 --> 30:18.947
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING,
LISBON?

30:18.991 --> 30:21.123
ASCENCIO--
IT SOUNDS CUBAN.

30:21.167 --> 30:23.647
THERE'S A SCAM
THAT THEY DO IN CUBA.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.388
BROKERS CHARGE
LARGE SUMS OF MONEY

30:25.432 --> 30:26.955
TO SURGICALLY
MODIFY FINGERPRINTS.

30:26.999 --> 30:29.131
THEY SWAP THE RIGHT FINGERTIPS
AND THE LEFT.

30:29.175 --> 30:31.960
IT FOOLS IMMIGRATION
EVERY TIME.

30:32.004 --> 30:33.396
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

30:33.440 --> 30:35.224
I'M A POLICE CHIEF.

30:38.532 --> 30:40.969
WITH A LOT OF READING TIME
ON MY HANDS.

30:42.492 --> 30:44.320
I DID WHAT CHIEF LISBON
SUGGESTED

30:44.364 --> 30:46.670
AND RAN THE LEFT-HAND
FINGERPRINTS FOR THE RIGHT,

30:46.714 --> 30:48.629
AND IT WORKED.

30:48.672 --> 30:51.501
CLEO ASCENCIO TRANSFORMS
INTO...

30:51.545 --> 30:54.156
[mouse clicks]JOSE MARTINEZ.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.331
AND WHO IS HE?

30:55.375 --> 30:57.551
A FRAUD. A STREET HUSTLER
FROM HAVANA.

30:57.594 --> 31:00.119
MADE A LIVING PICKING POCKETS
UNTIL HE STOLE A WALLET

31:00.162 --> 31:02.164
FROM ONE OF CASTRO'S
MINISTERS.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.384
NOW HE'S WANTED
BY THE P.N.R.

31:10.085 --> 31:12.000
JOSE MARTINEZ?

31:12.044 --> 31:14.089
HE FLED CUBA
AND SET UP SHOP HERE.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.874
OKAY, SO HE CHANGED
HIS NAME.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.701
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S A FRAUD.

31:17.745 --> 31:19.268
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHY HE WAS IN YOUR LOFT

31:19.312 --> 31:20.704
THE NIGHT YOUR HUSBAND
WENT MISSING?

31:20.748 --> 31:23.185
SURE. UH, CLEO WOULD
DROP BY SOMETIMES

31:23.229 --> 31:25.187
WHEN HE THOUGHT HE HAD
AN INSIGHT I SHOULD HERE.

31:25.231 --> 31:27.146
NOW, IF YOU WEREN'T HERE,

31:27.189 --> 31:28.712
WOULD ABEL LET HIM
INTO THE BUILDING?

31:28.756 --> 31:30.714
HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO.
CLEO HAD THE SECURITY CODE.

31:30.758 --> 31:32.194
HE WOULD JUST
BUZZ HIMSELF IN.

31:32.238 --> 31:33.848
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
WHAT HE WAS DOING

31:33.892 --> 31:36.938
IN YOUR BEDROOM
TWO NIGHTS AGO.IT DOES?

31:36.982 --> 31:38.505
HOT READING.

31:38.548 --> 31:40.594
IT'S THE BREAD AND BUTTER
OF THE SPIRITUAL FLIMFLAM MAN.

31:40.637 --> 31:43.945
YOU GATHER PERSONAL EFFECTS
ON YOUR SUBJECT IN ADVANCE,

31:43.989 --> 31:47.209
AND THEN YOU PRESENT THEM
AS PSYCHIC REVELATIONS.

31:47.253 --> 31:50.256
MARTINEZ CAME UP TO SEE
IF DEFIANCE WANTED A READING.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.214
BUT SHE WAS OUT DRINKING,
AND ABEL WAS ON THE ROOF.

31:52.258 --> 31:55.261
SO HE CAME UP INTO THE HOUSE
AND HE TOOK A LITTLE SNOOP.

31:55.304 --> 31:56.566
WHEN ABEL CAME DOWNSTAIRS,

31:56.610 --> 31:58.046
HE CAUGHT YOUR PSYCHIC
IN THE BEDROOM

31:58.090 --> 31:59.439
AND ASSUMED YOU WERE
SLEEPING WITH HIM.

32:01.049 --> 32:04.139
OKAY. FINE.

32:04.183 --> 32:05.575
BUT NONE OF THAT EXPLAINS

32:05.619 --> 32:07.403
WHO TOOK ABEL
FROM THE BUILDING.

32:07.447 --> 32:09.231
NO, IT DOESN'T,
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

32:09.275 --> 32:10.711
ABEL EVER LEFT THE BUILDING.

32:10.754 --> 32:12.931
IF MY SUSPICION IS CORRECT,

32:12.974 --> 32:16.021
HE IS STILL HERE,
AND HE IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE.

32:25.204 --> 32:28.033
ONE OF US NEEDS TO STAY HERE
WITH DEFIANCE.

32:28.076 --> 32:29.817
I'LL STAY.YOU DON'T WANT IN
ON THE BUST?

32:29.860 --> 32:32.689
NAH, THE THREE OF US HAVE DONE
A LOT OF BUSTS TOGETHER. YOU GO.

32:32.733 --> 32:35.823
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
A TAKEDOWN WITH JANE.

32:35.866 --> 32:37.781
SHUCKS.

32:37.825 --> 32:39.044
SHALL WE?

32:41.568 --> 32:45.311
[door creaking]

32:45.354 --> 32:46.355
[door closes]

32:48.792 --> 32:51.099
ONE...

32:51.143 --> 32:52.231
TWO...[chain clatters]

32:52.274 --> 32:54.102
THREE.

32:54.146 --> 32:56.322
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

32:56.365 --> 32:58.367
SEE? DISTRACTIBLE
AND PARANOID BY NATURE.

32:58.411 --> 33:01.196
CAN'T LET ANYONE PASS THIS DOOR
WITHOUT KNOWING WHO IT IS.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.417
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
OUT HERE?

33:04.460 --> 33:06.288
GLAD YOU ASKED.THERE'S BEEN A MURDER.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.074
AND YOU SAID ALREADY.
SCHNEIDERMAN.

33:09.117 --> 33:11.859
NO, HE WAS KIDNAPPED.
ANOTHER MAN'S BEEN MURDERED,

33:11.902 --> 33:13.469
BUT YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

33:13.513 --> 33:15.471
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

33:15.515 --> 33:16.864
SURE, YOU DO.
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING,

33:16.907 --> 33:18.648
INCLUDING WHERE SCHNEIDERMAN
IS RIGHT NOW.

33:18.692 --> 33:20.824
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

33:20.868 --> 33:22.652
HE'S IN YOUR APARTMENT,
ISN'T HE?

33:24.219 --> 33:27.831
PROBABLY IN THE BATHROOM.
NO. YOU VALUE YOUR PRIVACY.

33:27.875 --> 33:31.835
I'M GONNA SAY...
STASHED IN A CLOSET.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.533
WATCH OUT, JANE.[jiggles handle]

33:33.576 --> 33:35.839
OPEN THE DOOR, NGUYEN!

33:35.883 --> 33:38.146
UH, SOMEBODY GONNA BREAK
THE DOOR?

33:38.190 --> 33:39.843
GO AHEAD.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.932
ALL RIGHT, I'M READY.

33:43.282 --> 33:44.500
BREAK RIGHT.

34:08.263 --> 34:09.960
I GOT HIM.
GO FIND SCHNEIDERMAN.

34:10.004 --> 34:11.701
[Nguyen sighs]

34:13.573 --> 34:17.403
[muffled shouting]

34:17.446 --> 34:20.493
[whimpering and shouting
indistinctly, muffled]

34:20.536 --> 34:23.235
[muffled sobbing]

34:27.413 --> 34:29.067
[Abbott] DID YOU INVITE
JOSE MARTINEZ

34:29.110 --> 34:30.677
INTO YOUR LOFT
THE NIGHT OF HIS DEATH?

34:30.720 --> 34:32.635
NO. I CAME DOWN
FROM THE ROOF,

34:32.679 --> 34:34.246
AND HE WAS THERE
IN OUR BEDROOM.

34:34.289 --> 34:35.508
AND WHAT WAS HE DOING?

34:35.551 --> 34:37.771
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO KNOW.

34:41.253 --> 34:43.081
HEY!

34:43.124 --> 34:46.736
[shatters]HEY! ABEL!

34:46.780 --> 34:48.782
UH, THIS ISN'T
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

34:48.825 --> 34:51.437
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?UH... NOTHING. SEE?

34:51.480 --> 34:53.308
WHERE'S DEFIANCE?
DEFIANCE?!

34:53.352 --> 34:56.442
SHE'S NOT HERE.
I LET MYSELF IN! I SHOULD GO.

34:56.485 --> 34:58.618
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE![grunts]

34:58.661 --> 35:00.707
I'M SORRY, OKAY?
I SHOULD GO.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.361
[grunting]

35:02.404 --> 35:04.363
[Schneiderman]
I KIND OF LOST IT.

35:04.406 --> 35:07.105
[grunting continues,
objects shattering]

35:07.148 --> 35:09.063
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!

35:09.107 --> 35:10.934
[shouts indistinctly]
I'LL GO!

35:10.978 --> 35:12.762
HIS FOOT GOT CAUGHT
IN THE SHAG THROW.

35:12.806 --> 35:15.591
HIS--HIS HEAD HIT
THE COFFEE TABLE.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.116
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

35:19.247 --> 35:20.770
AND WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL THE POLICE?

35:20.814 --> 35:22.424
WITH A DEAD MAN
ON THE FLOOR?

35:22.468 --> 35:24.557
WHAT YOU DESCRIBED
IS INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.254
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT
IN SIX MONTHS.

35:26.298 --> 35:27.864
THEN WHAT?

35:27.908 --> 35:30.215
I WORK THE FEDS.
MY CAREER WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER.

35:30.258 --> 35:33.914
[voice breaks]
I WOULD HAVE LOST DEFIANCE.

35:33.957 --> 35:36.960
THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED
TO HIDE THE BODY.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.617
[door creaks and closes]

35:41.661 --> 35:43.358
[Fischer] AND THE SQUEAKY
HALLWAY DOOR MADE SURE

35:43.402 --> 35:46.013
YOU ALWAYS HEARD
THE SCHNEIDERMANS.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.798
THAT IS HOW YOU CAME TO SEE

35:48.842 --> 35:51.061
ABEL HAULING A BODY
TO THE ROOF.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.804
[scraping and rustling]

35:54.848 --> 35:57.459
WHO IS HE?[gasps]

35:57.503 --> 36:00.941
[sighs, panting]

36:00.984 --> 36:03.813
JUST SOMEBODY WHO DESERVED
WHAT HE GOT.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.815
THIS...
THIS IS A BAD DREAM.

36:05.859 --> 36:08.166
JUST GO BACK TO BED,
MR. NGUYEN.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.429
I'M NOT SLEEPY.

36:12.039 --> 36:13.345
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

36:13.388 --> 36:15.434
YOU WANT MONEY? FINE.

36:15.477 --> 36:16.913
I'LL GIVE YOU $5,000

36:16.957 --> 36:19.264
TO FORGET EVERYTHING
YOU SAW HERE TONIGHT.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.049
YOU'RE THAT SECURITY CONTRACTOR

36:22.092 --> 36:23.877
FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.662
YEAH.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.708
[cocks hammer]

36:30.623 --> 36:33.191
EXACTLY HOW MUCH ARE YOU
WORTH TO THE GOVERNMENT?

36:38.631 --> 36:40.676
OUR COLLEAGUE MR. JANE
SUSPECTED

36:40.720 --> 36:42.243
THERE WAS MORE TO YOU
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

36:42.287 --> 36:43.940
[Cho] YOU DIDN'T GET THOSE
SCARS ON YOUR FACE

36:43.984 --> 36:45.377
FROM RUNNING A NOODLE SHOP.

36:45.420 --> 36:48.118
YOU'RE A GANGSTER FROM WAY BACK.
GREEN DRAGONS?

36:48.162 --> 36:49.555
[chuckles]

36:52.993 --> 36:54.168
"BORN TO KILL."

36:55.778 --> 36:58.999
IT WAS THE BLOODIEST STREET GANG
IN NEW YORK HISTORY.

36:59.042 --> 37:01.871
ALL VIETNAMESE REFUGEES.

37:03.003 --> 37:04.918
I HEAR YOU GUYS OWNED
CHINATOWN IN THE '80s.

37:04.961 --> 37:06.615
WE OWNED NEW YORK.

37:06.659 --> 37:09.836
ONE LAST STORY
FOR THE RECORD BOOKS.

37:09.879 --> 37:12.099
HOW AN ORIGINAL MEMBER
OF B.T.K.

37:12.142 --> 37:15.668
ALMOST TOOK THE FEDS
FOR $10 MILLION.

37:15.711 --> 37:17.887
GIVE ME THAT CONFESSION.

37:17.931 --> 37:19.759
[exhales]

37:19.802 --> 37:21.413

37:28.071 --> 37:29.421
[clicks pen]

37:29.464 --> 37:31.945
[knock on door][typing]

37:38.995 --> 37:40.910
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME?

37:40.954 --> 37:43.696
YOU HAVE A SHARP MIND.

37:43.739 --> 37:45.524
AND PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

37:45.567 --> 37:46.829
SOME PEOPLE.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.657
WELL...

37:50.224 --> 37:51.834
I DIDN'T THINK SO BEFORE,

37:51.878 --> 37:56.274
BUT I CAN SEE THIS ARRANGEMENT
WORKING ON A PERMANENT BASIS.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.493
I LIKE YOU, TOO, DENNIS.

37:58.537 --> 38:00.626

YEAH, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.
THERE'S NO DEALS.

38:05.587 --> 38:07.720
NO DEMANDS, NO NEGOTIATIONS.

38:07.763 --> 38:11.289
WE ARE OFFERING YOU A CAREER,
A CLEAN SLATE,

38:11.332 --> 38:14.770
A CHANCE
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

38:14.814 --> 38:17.991
[sighs]

38:20.298 --> 38:23.344
YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN,
DENNIS.

38:24.998 --> 38:26.913
OKAY, PET LEOPARD'S
OFF THE TABLE.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.567
FORGET ABOUT THAT.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.960
BUT I NEED THE FULL PARDON.
AND THE AIRSTREAM.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.614
AND I NEED A COUCH, MAN,

38:32.658 --> 38:35.356
'CAUSE EVERYTHING IS COLD

38:35.400 --> 38:37.184
AND...

38:37.227 --> 38:39.795
I NEED A JOB OFFER
FOR LISBON.

38:39.839 --> 38:42.276
I AM SURE THAT SOME PEOPLE

38:42.320 --> 38:44.757
FIND THIS SIDE OF YOU
ENDEARING...

38:47.847 --> 38:49.936
BUT I'M NOT ONE OF THEM.

38:51.981 --> 38:55.594
I'LL BE FOLLOWING
YOUR MURDER TRIAL ON THE TV.

38:55.637 --> 38:56.856
GOOD LUCK.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.248
OKAY.

38:58.292 --> 38:59.424
THANK YOU.

FELLAS. STOP RIGHT THERE.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.154
JANE...

39:34.197 --> 39:36.243
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS FROM?

39:36.286 --> 39:38.985
OH, A THUMB DRIVE
GAIL BERTRAM WAS HIDING.

39:39.028 --> 39:41.466
THIS IS THE FIRST
I'M HEARING ABOUT IT.

39:41.509 --> 39:43.598
IT'S THE FIRST
I'VE TALKED OF IT.

39:43.642 --> 39:47.515
THESE ARE ALL THE MEMBERS
OF THE BLAKE ASSOCIATION.

39:47.559 --> 39:49.256
CORRECT.

39:49.299 --> 39:51.824
I FIGURED BERTRAM WAS
KEEPING IT AS INSURANCE.

39:51.867 --> 39:54.827
WELL, WE'VE ARRESTED
OR RETIRED ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.306
YES, YOU HAVE--

39:56.350 --> 39:58.831
EXCEPT THE ONES
THAT I'VE BLACKED OUT.

39:58.874 --> 40:01.094
THOSE ONES YOU HAVEN'T CAUGHT.

40:01.137 --> 40:03.139
WE CAUGHT THEM ALL.

40:03.183 --> 40:06.055
DID YOU? WELL, I GUESS
BERTRAM WAS WRONG THEN.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.016
GIVE ME THE NAMES.

40:10.059 --> 40:11.844
A COUPLE OF JUDGES,
A CONGRESSMAN,

40:11.887 --> 40:13.715
SEVERAL F.B.I. AGENTS.NAMES.

40:13.759 --> 40:15.238
BIG NAMES, SOME OF THEM.

40:15.282 --> 40:17.284
IF THAT LIST EVER GOT OUT
TO THE PRESS,

40:17.327 --> 40:20.113
IT'D CAUSE ALL KINDS
OF TURMOIL, WOULDN'T IT?

40:20.156 --> 40:22.420
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?OH, NO.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.639
JUST POINTING OUT
THAT WE BOTH HAVE THE POWER

40:24.683 --> 40:26.336
TO CREATE MISERY.

40:27.903 --> 40:29.427
OKAY.

40:29.470 --> 40:31.385
YOU GIVE ME THE NAMES,
AND WE'LL AGREE

40:31.429 --> 40:34.780
TO ALL OF YOUR TERMS
ON THE CONTRACT.

40:34.823 --> 40:37.913
IF I GIVE YOU THE NAMES,
YOU'LL BREAK THE CONTRACT.

40:37.957 --> 40:39.828
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE IT ONCE.

40:39.872 --> 40:41.482
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE?

40:41.526 --> 40:43.832
I PROPOSE THAT YOU SURRENDER
TO MY TERMS,

40:43.876 --> 40:45.704
AND WHEN I'M FINISHED
WITH YOUR CONTRACT,

40:45.747 --> 40:47.575
AND ONLY THEN,

40:47.619 --> 40:49.621
I WILL GIVE YOU THE NAMES.

40:52.972 --> 40:54.321
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

41:01.937 --> 41:05.201
[inhales and clears throat]

41:11.164 --> 41:13.209
MM...

41:13.253 --> 41:15.298
WELL...HMM?

41:15.342 --> 41:16.952
YOU DID IT THIS TIME.

41:16.996 --> 41:18.911
YOU BROUGHT THE F.B.I.
TO ITS KNEES.

41:18.954 --> 41:20.869
[chuckles]

41:20.913 --> 41:21.957
DID I?

41:22.001 --> 41:24.133
THEY CONCEDED
TO ALL YOUR DEMANDS.

41:24.177 --> 41:26.962
EVERY SINGLE ONE.
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

41:27.006 --> 41:28.747
WELL, REMEMBER
THAT THUMB DRIVE

41:28.790 --> 41:30.313
WE FOUND IN BERTRAM'S
WINE CELLAR?

41:30.357 --> 41:31.619
THE ENCRYPTED DATABASE?

41:31.663 --> 41:34.013
IT'S A LIST
OF BLAKE ASSOCIATION MEMBERS.

41:34.056 --> 41:35.405
I USED IT AS LEVERAGE.

41:35.449 --> 41:36.885
BUT WE NEVER BROKE
THE ENCRYPTION.

41:36.929 --> 41:38.800
[lowered voice] YEAH,
THE F.B.I. DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

41:40.846 --> 41:42.848
[lowered voice]
THAT'S WHY YOU ESCAPED.

41:42.891 --> 41:44.502
TO CREATE A BOGUS LIST
OF NAMES.

41:44.545 --> 41:48.070
AND TO ENJOY A BACON-WRAPPED
HOT DOG.

41:48.114 --> 41:50.638
[normal voice] I HAVE TO SAY,
I AM IMPRESSED.

41:50.682 --> 41:53.598
YOU OUTPLAYED THE F.B.I.[scoffs, normal voice]
NO CONTEST.

41:53.641 --> 41:55.164
DID THEY TELL YOU
WHEN I START WORK?

41:55.208 --> 41:57.776
WHEN WESTART.

41:57.819 --> 41:59.125
WE?

41:59.168 --> 42:00.518
WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB?

42:00.561 --> 42:02.650
NAH. IT WAS BORING.YEAH, I TOLD YOU.

42:02.694 --> 42:04.522
YEAH. BUT YOU HAD
NO RIGHT TO.

42:04.565 --> 42:06.262
IT'S MY LIFE, AND I'LL DECIDE
WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

42:06.306 --> 42:08.917
AND YOU DECIDED CORRECTLY.THERE WAS NEVER ANY CHOICE.

42:08.961 --> 42:10.832
OH, COME ON. IT'LL BE FUN.

42:10.876 --> 42:12.704
LET'S SEE WHAT KIND
OF TROUBLE WE CAN MAKE.

42:12.747 --> 42:14.444
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

42:14.488 --> 42:15.707
FOR ME?

42:15.750 --> 42:17.535
MM-HMM.

42:25.064 --> 42:26.848

42:26.892 --> 42:29.416
HANDMADE IN WASHINGTON.

42:30.678 --> 42:32.332
OH...
