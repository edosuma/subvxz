04:21.053 --> 04:24.306
Sweet girl, you're not gonna let us down.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.991
You were never here for us before.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.076
I'm so glad

08:13.493 --> 08:15.370
you could start now.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.040
And you can all see...

08:18.582 --> 08:20.459
The reason is right in front of us.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.169
Your I-Ching horoscope.

09:10.133 --> 09:13.136
Your wedding is February 14th?

09:16.014 --> 09:17.849
You should have been married in April.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.565
Your ovaries are very healthy.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.317
Very powerful flow.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.027
You'll be pregnant on your first try.

09:31.655 --> 09:32.864
Stable.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.199
Obedient.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.910
A lap dog of a man!

10:13.613 --> 10:14.614
I'm what?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.783
I have a bat mitzvah I must attend.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.827
Please hold up.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.333
You're right.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.127
Success has to be recognised.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.676
I-Ching horoscope.

10:42.351 --> 10:45.312
You said your business was successful?

10:50.650 --> 10:51.651
Your palm.

10:56.365 --> 11:01.036
Your love line and career line
are tangled.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.500
Finding your soul mate
will help your business.

11:15.300 --> 11:19.888
And this person will be
one of the next five dates you go on.

53:16.861 --> 53:19.697
Shame on you both.

53:53.314 --> 53:55.232
You've gone too far.

54:17.630 --> 54:19.882
Wishing you prosperity!

01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:50.564
You know...

01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:52.733
Life is like a dance.

01:00:53.192 --> 01:00:54.985
Find your balance.

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:57.029
Follow the rhythm.

01:00:57.738 --> 01:01:00.324
Dance however you want.

01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:36.001
I'm sorry.

01:11:40.255 --> 01:11:41.464
No, I'm sorry.

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.789
Not him, huh?

01:14:25.837 --> 01:14:26.754
No.

01:14:26.838 --> 01:14:29.174
But they're going to be
very happy together.

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:31.926
So, who did you choose?

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:43.897
My child, I didn't say whose wedding.

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:47.609
I believe you have one date left.

01:14:52.614 --> 01:14:55.325
Your sister has amazing taste
in hors d'oeuvres.

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.449
I can't say.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:45.078
I wish you guys

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.163
one hundred years of happiness.
