08:54.260 --> 08:54.926
<i>Harold!</i>

08:54.961 --> 08:57.762
<i>I knew we should have gone
to Sandals with my sister.</i>

08:57.797 --> 09:01.198
<i>Follow the green puma!</i>

09:01.233 --> 09:03.234
<i>I have the power!</i>

09:03.302 --> 09:04.769
<i>Got to take a picture of this.</i>

09:04.837 --> 09:05.836
<i>[ Zap! ]</i>

09:05.872 --> 09:06.570
<i>Hey!</i>

09:06.606 --> 09:08.138
<i>Harold!</i>

09:08.207 --> 09:09.206
<i>What the...?</i>

09:09.241 --> 09:10.474
<i>What the [bleep]</i>

09:10.509 --> 09:12.209
<i>Disco!</i>

09:12.244 --> 09:13.010
<i>Aah!</i>

09:13.045 --> 09:14.211
<i>Hyah!</i>

09:14.247 --> 09:18.583
<i>Roar!</i>

09:18.618 --> 09:21.686
<i>Good going, uh... Harold.</i>

09:21.755 --> 09:23.320
<i>Hero-old?</i>

09:23.356 --> 09:24.855
<i>Nope, just Harold.</i>

09:24.891 --> 09:28.425
<i>You'll have to do better than
riding a middle-aged tourist</i>

09:28.493 --> 09:32.061
<i>into battle to defeat me, He-Man.</i>

09:32.130 --> 09:33.596
<i>Not sure that needed saying.</i>

09:33.631 --> 09:36.933
<i>Quick, He-Rold, we'll
take out Beast Man first.</i>

09:36.968 --> 09:38.701
<i>Which one is Beast Man?</i>

09:38.736 --> 09:39.769
<i>I'm confused.</i>

09:39.804 --> 09:40.669
<i>Yeah, see?</i>

09:40.704 --> 09:41.503
<i>New plan.</i>

09:41.539 --> 09:44.873
<i>I'll pretend to give myself up,
and when I say "Not today,"</i>

09:44.909 --> 09:47.142
<i>that's your cue to jump on Beast Man.</i>

09:47.177 --> 09:50.479
<i>Maybe pissing myself
could be a diversion.</i>

09:50.514 --> 09:51.947
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

09:51.982 --> 09:53.348
<i>You win, Skeletor.</i>

09:53.417 --> 09:56.152
<i>You're...
Harold, I want to go home.</i>

09:56.187 --> 10:01.758
<i>As soon as we get our hotel deposit
back, we are out of this mad house.</i>

10:01.793 --> 10:02.592
<i>[ Gasps ]</i>

10:02.661 --> 10:07.030
<i>But the deposit was non-refundable.</i>

10:07.065 --> 10:11.568
<i>Maybe they'll make an exception
for He-Man's new battle cat.</i>

10:11.604 --> 10:15.205
<i>Oh, who rides -- who
rides a cat, anyway?</i>

10:15.241 --> 10:17.408
<i>You'll find out tonight.</i>

10:17.443 --> 10:20.477
<i>Not tod-- yah!</i>

10:20.513 --> 10:24.125
<i>Victory!</i>

10:24.245 --> 10:28.387
<i>Please, please take me
to Sandals with you.</i>
