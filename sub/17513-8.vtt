00:05.953 --> 00:07.394
Hi, you've called Emma.

00:07.419 --> 00:10.206
I'm not here. Honestly, I'm
probably patting a street cat.

00:10.231 --> 00:12.984
Anyway, leave me a message.
Or don't. Do what you want.

00:13.009 --> 00:15.378
Live your own life! Okay, bye. Whoo!

00:15.589 --> 00:17.439
Em, it's 9.45 and you're still not here.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.600
Can you please let me know if
you're coming in or not today?

00:27.075 --> 00:29.280
- Morning, Emma.
- Mrs Marsh.

00:30.756 --> 00:33.040
Hey, Em, can I see you
in my office, please?

00:41.926 --> 00:43.145
- You've...
- Can we swap?

00:43.170 --> 00:45.079
- What?
- Can we swap seats?

00:45.080 --> 00:47.371
I feel like I'm in
the Principal's office.

00:54.754 --> 00:56.999
You're 45 minutes late.
We've got an inspection at...

00:57.000 --> 00:59.655
10am, I know. I have an excuse.

00:59.969 --> 01:01.320
All right, let's hear it.

01:02.672 --> 01:03.959
I wanted to sleep in.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.439
That's not an excuse. That's
what you cover up with an excuse.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.079
Damien doesn't believe in alarm clocks.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.999
That's rich, coming from
a guy who owns 20 of them.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.400
They're not plugged in.

01:13.703 --> 01:16.479
Look, the reason I wanted you here
on time, one, because it's your job

01:16.480 --> 01:19.705
and two, I've got something
I need to talk to you about.

01:19.730 --> 01:22.200
- Are you firing me?
- No, you're not fired.

01:22.225 --> 01:24.332
By the way, showing up late isn't
a great way to avoid getting fired.

01:24.357 --> 01:26.199
You should be getting here earlier.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.079
- Or at least on time.
- So I am fired.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.640
No, you're not fired.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.199
- I've got some news.
- You're not a natural redhead.

01:33.387 --> 01:35.827
Yeah, of course I am. Look at me.

01:39.523 --> 01:41.683
Mum's coming back to work soon and...

01:42.860 --> 01:44.138
when she does...

01:45.683 --> 01:47.654
I'm going to move with
Grace to the Gold Coast.

01:49.596 --> 01:51.519
The... what?

01:51.520 --> 01:53.852
The Gold Coast.

01:54.924 --> 01:56.853
I-I just... Mum doesn't need me here

01:56.878 --> 02:00.599
and I feel like there'll be more
opportunities for me over there.

02:01.813 --> 02:03.206
Plus all the theme parks.

02:06.181 --> 02:07.490
Good for you.

02:09.428 --> 02:11.240
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:14.264 --> 02:15.360
Thanks?

02:16.600 --> 02:19.560
I'm really happy for
you. Grace is great.

02:20.793 --> 02:23.439
Uh, good.

02:24.112 --> 02:25.186
Great.

02:29.978 --> 02:31.919
Are we... cool?

02:32.554 --> 02:33.852
Yeah, we're cool.

02:35.662 --> 02:37.040
Cool.

02:39.396 --> 02:42.038
I'm really cool. I'm probably
going to freeze to death.

02:43.265 --> 02:47.984
I'm so cool, a polar bear
tried to live near me.

02:48.133 --> 02:50.935
I'm so cool, if I stuck
my finger in your drink,

02:50.960 --> 02:53.457
it would be ice cold from the coolness.

02:53.482 --> 02:54.847
Please don't stick
your finger in my drink.

02:54.872 --> 02:57.152
Do you not like that? Because I do
it every time you're not looking.

02:59.621 --> 03:00.920
I'm glad we're cool.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.074

03:12.894 --> 03:16.847
8 Morebury Lane. This might be
our last inspection together.

03:16.972 --> 03:19.199
You're really heaping on
the sad today, aren't you?

03:19.200 --> 03:22.455
Yeah, sorry. So what are your plans?

03:23.135 --> 03:25.079
Go back to Melbourne.
Become Prime Minister.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.679
That's a good plan.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.039
Or I guess Flight Centre
will give me my old job back.

03:29.260 --> 03:31.879
You could buy this house,
move in with a bunch of cats.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.000
It'll save us having
to find new tenants.

03:43.305 --> 03:44.652
Nah, I'm good.

04:21.841 --> 04:23.753
There's mouldy food everywhere,

04:23.778 --> 04:26.120
and there's a melted
basketball in the oven.

04:26.145 --> 04:27.536
- Oh, my God.
- How are the bedrooms?

04:27.561 --> 04:29.552
Eugh. There's more open milk cartons.

04:29.577 --> 04:31.985
- They must have done that on purpose.
- And some vomit in the corner.

04:32.010 --> 04:32.946
- Great.
- It's mine.

04:32.971 --> 04:34.265
- Em!
- I'm sorry!

04:34.290 --> 04:35.922
Damien and I challenged each
other to see who could eat

04:35.947 --> 04:37.502
the most mie gorengs last night.

04:37.676 --> 04:39.135
- Shit.
- Eugh. What is it?

04:39.160 --> 04:41.412
I've stepped in actual
shit. Please be from a dog.

04:41.437 --> 04:43.276
- Oh!
- Eugh!

04:45.104 --> 04:47.884
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?

04:51.037 --> 04:52.918
God, I can still smell it all over me.

04:52.943 --> 04:54.519
Well, these clothes
are going in the ocean.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.175
- Mum's going to kill me.
- Why?

04:56.200 --> 04:57.797
You didn't stick dirty
undies to the wall.

04:57.822 --> 05:01.353
Yeah, but I approved the tenants
that did. They seemed fine.

05:01.751 --> 05:04.599
One of them kept saying, "Cool
bananas". Is that a... is that a thing?

05:06.005 --> 05:08.125
Hello, Daniel McCallum's
phone. Emma speaking.

05:11.089 --> 05:12.030
What?

05:13.702 --> 05:17.070
They told me we haven't been
making the mortgage payments.

05:17.095 --> 05:19.239
Bloody banks. All they
think about is money.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.559
- They can't stop us working.
- They have stopped us.

05:21.560 --> 05:22.719
Have they?

05:23.844 --> 05:24.877
Hey, mate!

05:25.893 --> 05:27.612
Do you wanna sell your house?

05:27.637 --> 05:30.705
Um, yeah. I was thinking
about it, actually.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.679
Great! Let me just get you a card!

05:33.017 --> 05:34.389
Shit!

05:37.720 --> 05:41.076
Was it Stuart? I'll strangle
him with his bow tie.

05:41.443 --> 05:43.092
Did you really need to
put a chain on the place?

05:43.117 --> 05:44.101
We got it off.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.361
Oh, and good luck trying that one again,

05:45.386 --> 05:47.236
because I'm sleeping with a locksmith.

05:47.391 --> 05:48.788
I told you when I get back to work,

05:48.813 --> 05:50.798
I'll start making
regular payments again.

05:51.793 --> 05:52.839
All right.

05:54.614 --> 05:56.919
Bloody Sue. I got her that job.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.306
Mum, this is bad.

05:58.331 --> 06:00.495
Your Grade 1 nativity
was bad. This is fine.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.452
That was a script,

06:01.477 --> 06:03.879
and I think failing to pay
your mortgage is pretty bad.

06:04.225 --> 06:06.999
I've got multiple listings
ready to go as soon as I'm back.

06:07.286 --> 06:09.899
- New listings?
- Yeah. I've got a mobile, you know.

06:09.924 --> 06:11.959
Well, why didn't you send them my way?

06:12.147 --> 06:14.146
We both know you're not
the best salesperson.

06:14.841 --> 06:17.256
I've got an investor coming
down from Sydney on Thursday,

06:17.281 --> 06:19.116
looking to purchase some
more properties from us.

06:19.141 --> 06:20.440
So just let me handle it.

06:20.465 --> 06:22.149
- Fine.
- We already manage one of hers.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.439
She'll want to see it while she's here.

06:23.440 --> 06:24.182
Okay.

06:24.207 --> 06:27.057
You did the final inspection on
it this morning. 8 Morebury Lane.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.560
- 8 Morebury...
- Yeah. How'd it look?

06:33.301 --> 06:35.009
- Good.
- Good.

06:39.123 --> 06:39.780
It's fine.

06:39.805 --> 06:42.307
We'll just call all the cleaners
we can find, hire them all at once

06:42.332 --> 06:44.507
and pray they can finish
the job before she gets here.

06:44.532 --> 06:46.151
Why didn't you tell Barbara?
You're leaving anyway.

06:46.176 --> 06:47.843
Because I haven't told her I'm
going yet, I can't just say,

06:47.868 --> 06:49.882
"Hey, Mum, I'm leaving and I
stuffed up the only chance you have

06:49.907 --> 06:51.524
- "of not going bankrupt."
- So we're in a rush?

06:51.549 --> 06:52.669
- Yes.
- Great.

06:57.432 --> 06:58.559
Ow!

06:58.560 --> 07:01.320
- Just get in the car.
- One more time.

07:04.863 --> 07:05.717
Ow!

07:09.554 --> 07:11.369
McCallum Real Estate, this is Daniel.

07:11.409 --> 07:13.439
Yes. Did you have a look? Can you do it?

07:14.299 --> 07:15.814
Okay, but are you sure it's blood?

07:15.839 --> 07:18.813
It could be jam or sauce.

07:19.477 --> 07:21.119
Okay, once you put
gloves on, does it matter?

07:21.601 --> 07:23.009
Please don't hang up. Please!

07:27.001 --> 07:28.545
I called Tom's Reliable Cleaners

07:28.570 --> 07:30.159
but they've been a
servo for three years.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.352
Did you have any luck?

07:33.433 --> 07:35.749
What about those guys that
clean crime scenes and stuff?

07:36.296 --> 07:38.638
I tried them. They said they're
booked up until next week.

07:38.663 --> 07:41.746
Oh. That sucks for us, and society.

07:43.269 --> 07:45.159
- We're going to have to do it.
- Hm?

07:45.746 --> 07:47.279
We're going to have to clean the house.

07:47.686 --> 07:49.948
- With what? Our hands?
- Yes.

07:49.973 --> 07:51.251
Uh, you might have blocked this out,

07:51.276 --> 07:52.547
because of how gross it was in there.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.952
- But it's really gross in there.
- I remember.

07:54.977 --> 07:58.176
Dan, I vomited in there,
and I've slept at the tip.

07:58.449 --> 08:00.210
- What? Why?
- It doesn't matter.

08:00.235 --> 08:01.841
I'm just saying this
is grosser than that.

08:01.866 --> 08:03.961
You can't just say, "I slept at a
tip" and then not tell the rest...

08:03.986 --> 08:05.719
I was drunk, I was walking
home, there was a mattress.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.319
See, now you're disappointed.
It's not a good story.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.557
Look, Em, please?

08:09.582 --> 08:12.782
This is the last thing I'll
ever ask you to do for me.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.299
Okay, guys.

08:18.882 --> 08:21.601
First of all, thanks to Grace
and Damien for coming to help.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.599
They had to come because they kiss us.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.352
- I like your overalls.
- Who wouldn't?

08:25.377 --> 08:27.399
Anyway, we've got to
get this place spotless

08:27.400 --> 08:28.525
before the landlord arrives,

08:28.550 --> 08:31.468
and before we start, can
we do a quick supply check?

08:31.493 --> 08:33.232
- Uh, Grace.
- OK.

08:33.340 --> 08:37.943
I have gloves, anti-bacterial
wipes, disinfectant, Band-Aids,

08:37.969 --> 08:39.445
and protein bars for all of us.

08:39.470 --> 08:42.229
Oh, thank you. That's
very, very kind. Um, Damien.

08:43.284 --> 08:46.837
Uh, I brought my toolbox, so if
there are any minor repairs needed,

08:46.862 --> 08:49.239
I should be able to take care of them.

08:49.240 --> 08:52.140
I also brought pegs. There
should be some blue ones in here.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.304
Yeah, rubber bands, couple of those.

08:54.329 --> 08:56.136
Thanks, Damien. Uh, Emma?

08:56.161 --> 08:58.719
I've got all of the boring cleaning
supplies you asked me to get.

08:58.744 --> 09:00.839
- Which are?
- And... beer.

09:01.227 --> 09:03.267
OK, well, let's save those till the end.

09:08.274 --> 09:09.400
Let's get started.

09:12.198 --> 09:13.913
And he doesn't drink
creamy soda anymore.

09:13.938 --> 09:17.032
It's his favourite and he told me
he's never going to drink it again.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.426
Because it's got too much sugar?

09:18.451 --> 09:21.705
And he's putting frozen spinach
in a blender for breakfast.

09:22.048 --> 09:23.439
Oh, yeah. Is that good?

09:23.623 --> 09:26.639
No, it's frozen spinach.
In a blender. For breakfast.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.839
And she showed up 45
minutes late, again.

09:29.140 --> 09:30.559
Did she say why?

09:31.003 --> 09:33.799
No. She doesn't even
make up excuses anymore.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.679
At least they were fun to hear.

09:36.615 --> 09:38.208
She told me once that she got mugged,

09:38.233 --> 09:38.959
but they didn't take anything

09:38.984 --> 09:40.983
because she answered
their riddle correctly.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.719
You know what is good?
Melted butter on fruit.

09:44.353 --> 09:45.599
- What?
- Yeah.

09:46.205 --> 09:48.439
Oh, maybe I'm thinking
of something else.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.359
- Don't quote me.
- Oh, I won't.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.439
Is she upset about the move?

09:52.931 --> 09:55.680
I don't know. She says it's fine, a lot.

09:57.560 --> 10:01.319
Grace, the fumes from
this, they're safe, right?

10:01.590 --> 10:04.639
Just don't spray it in your
mouth and you'll be okay.

10:05.184 --> 10:06.119
Check.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.679
Yeww! Ahhh!

10:09.295 --> 10:10.879
Oh, my God!

10:11.288 --> 10:13.479
Can you imagine if I
hadn't looked up here?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.239
- Em...
- It just would have stayed there.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.119
Forever. Oh, almost.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.639
- Oh, that was...
- Why are you...

10:18.640 --> 10:20.239
I found a trampoline. I'm keeping it.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.944
There's a condom in the light.
These guys were thorough.

10:22.969 --> 10:24.815
Just use a stepladder so
you don't hurt yourself.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.599
I'm like a centimetre off the ground.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.021
Grace, how many people
do you see for accidents

10:28.046 --> 10:29.142
that could have easily been avoided?

10:29.167 --> 10:31.880
Um, mostly just Phil because he refuses

10:31.905 --> 10:33.711
to walk around the dart
players to get to the toilet.

10:33.736 --> 10:34.919
Daniel wouldn't know
what you're talking about

10:34.944 --> 10:36.416
because he never goes to
the pub with me anymore.

10:36.441 --> 10:38.547
- I'm saying if a spring breaks in...
- Damien will catch me.

10:38.572 --> 10:40.159
- He's not even looking.
- What?

10:40.354 --> 10:42.724
Or listening. I'll just get the
stepladder. It'll be quicker anyway.

10:42.749 --> 10:46.069
- Got it!
- Oh, God! Em!

10:53.764 --> 10:55.187
It's like we've barely made a dent.

10:55.212 --> 10:57.011
Milk cartons are gone.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.999
The smell's not.

10:59.385 --> 11:00.479
Em?

11:01.433 --> 11:02.479
What?

11:04.200 --> 11:06.353
We're going to have to stay overnight.

11:06.378 --> 11:07.364
No!

11:07.389 --> 11:08.681
Tonight, Damien and I are going to see

11:08.706 --> 11:10.667
if we can cook pasta in
wine instead of water.

11:10.692 --> 11:12.634
- I'm sorry, but...
- We were going to try red and white.

11:12.659 --> 11:15.182
- And port.
- Oh, and the melted butter thing.

11:15.643 --> 11:17.373
Okay, well, that all
sounds really important,

11:17.398 --> 11:18.798
but we don't have a choice.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.639
We've been doing it all day.

11:20.817 --> 11:22.259
Could you please just
hang in a little longer?

11:23.878 --> 11:24.559
Okay.

11:25.220 --> 11:26.764
I should have brought more beer.

11:27.840 --> 11:32.300
Um, Grace, Damien, you guys go home.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.279
- Thanks for today.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.799
Well, I'll go and get us some
caffeine and then I'll come back.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.239
Thank you.

11:38.754 --> 11:40.301
Damien, no pressure.

11:40.918 --> 11:42.279
I slept yesterday.

11:43.031 --> 11:44.160
Oh!

11:49.949 --> 11:51.200
Go team.

12:01.817 --> 12:04.488
It's like my whole life has
been scrubbing this toilet.

12:04.513 --> 12:05.988
Take this twice a day.

12:06.013 --> 12:07.492
What?

12:07.680 --> 12:09.588
Daniel, if you want to talk to me,

12:09.613 --> 12:11.453
you're going to need to
tap me on the shoulder.

12:13.557 --> 12:17.102
Oh, God. Is this a stingray?

12:17.399 --> 12:20.334
- Oh, no, it's a fake.
- Oh, Jesus! Oh, Grace, don't, don't.

12:20.359 --> 12:22.261
- Get it away from me. Oh!
- Daniel, just touch it.

12:22.286 --> 12:23.925
- No. No.
- It's... okay.

12:25.285 --> 12:26.590
- Better?
- No.

12:29.863 --> 12:31.120
It's beautiful.

12:34.172 --> 12:35.086
What are you doing?

12:36.975 --> 12:37.879
Jealous?

12:38.363 --> 12:39.359
Not now, Em. Can you please...

12:39.360 --> 12:41.491
- I'm going to paint over it.
- We don't have time for this.

12:41.516 --> 12:43.228
It is the same amount of painting time.

12:43.253 --> 12:43.919
No, it isn't.

12:43.944 --> 12:45.545
If it was, you'd see a
bunch of half-painted houses

12:45.570 --> 12:46.624
covered in dicks all the time.

12:46.649 --> 12:47.903
Just go side to side.

12:47.928 --> 12:49.910
I'm just trying to make a shitty day,

12:49.935 --> 12:51.779
then night then day
again a bit more fun.

12:51.804 --> 12:54.097
- Last time I do you a favour.
- You're not doing me a favour.

12:54.122 --> 12:55.919
Grace and Damien are doing me a favour.

12:55.944 --> 12:57.279
- This is your job.
- Oh, right.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.919
Well, who do I speak to in HR

12:58.920 --> 13:02.229
about getting less 24-hour
shifts cleaning human filth?

13:02.254 --> 13:03.762
Well, I don't know, maybe
you could ask them what to do

13:03.787 --> 13:05.455
with an employee who keeps
drawing dicks on the wall.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.055
- Keep? It's my first one!
- Oh, Em, grow up!

13:10.305 --> 13:13.400
- Grow up?
- Yes, grow up.

13:16.819 --> 13:18.775
I'm not the one leaving
'cause things got too hard.

13:19.024 --> 13:20.203
I'm leaving because I did everything...

13:20.228 --> 13:21.513
Do you think I don't
know what you're doing?

13:21.538 --> 13:22.870
You meet some girl, sorry Grace,

13:22.895 --> 13:24.655
and you turn into some fit business jerk

13:24.680 --> 13:26.307
and you're using it as
an excuse to run away.

13:26.332 --> 13:28.392
Nah, he's just moving
onwards and upwards,

13:28.417 --> 13:29.541
and you look really great, Dan.

13:29.566 --> 13:31.256
I'm just trying to improve myself.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.467
The whole reason you're
here is because you ran away.

13:33.492 --> 13:35.759
And now you're hanging out in
some hoarder's den, sorry, Damien,

13:35.760 --> 13:37.559
throwing your life away,
acting like a child.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.590
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with looking at the world

13:39.615 --> 13:41.039
with a child-like sense of wonder.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.405
You actually think you're
better than me, don't you?

13:42.430 --> 13:44.615
No, I think you could be
better but you're too immature

13:44.640 --> 13:45.834
and you're too lazy to
do anything about it.

13:45.859 --> 13:48.188
I am not the one who approved
the worst tenants on Earth.

13:48.213 --> 13:50.399
Just admit that you're leaving
because you're shit at your job!

13:50.400 --> 13:51.786
The only reason your mum
doesn't let you do anything

13:51.811 --> 13:54.834
other than change the photocopier
paper is because you keep failing.

13:54.859 --> 13:57.459
Well, maybe I'd be better at my job
if I wasn't always babysitting you.

13:57.484 --> 13:58.476
All I've done is help you.

13:58.501 --> 14:01.740
By showing up at my doorstep
and sponging off me? Huge help.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.267
Do you know what? I'm glad
you're going. I'm glad.

14:03.292 --> 14:07.327
You're unbelievable.
You are... You're a...

14:12.218 --> 14:13.468
Come on, Damien.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.199
Sorry, Daniel.

14:18.465 --> 14:21.225
Taking my handyman, too. Real helpful!

14:22.507 --> 14:24.107
Interesting artwork.

14:27.163 --> 14:29.870
Grace, do you mind if my
son and I talk in private?

14:29.895 --> 14:32.573
I actually think an independent
third party would be beneficial.

14:32.598 --> 14:34.278
Daniel, get in here.

14:40.950 --> 14:43.239
- Oh, being angry sucks!
- Anything I can do?

14:43.264 --> 14:45.623
Immature and lazy. He thinks
I'm stupid. I am not stupid.

14:45.648 --> 14:48.367
I'm fun. All I've done is
help him since I've been here.

14:48.732 --> 14:50.999
- I'm going to listen and wait.
- He thinks I can't do anything.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.480
He thinks I'm running
away. I am not running away.

14:57.777 --> 15:01.560
- Hey! Mick!
- Hey!

15:05.269 --> 15:07.665
Why did you keep this from me? Were
you just going to let me find out

15:07.690 --> 15:08.872
- when I brought Denise through today?
- No, no, no.

15:08.897 --> 15:11.557
Mum, no cleaner would touch this place.
I figured if Em and I could fix...

15:11.582 --> 15:13.497
I wouldn't find out that you
didn't screen the tenants properly?

15:13.522 --> 15:13.966
No.

15:13.991 --> 15:15.900
- You may not care what I do...
- Of course I care!

15:15.925 --> 15:17.788
Why do you think I've been
scrubbing a toilet all night

15:17.813 --> 15:20.335
that smells like it's where the poos
from all the other toilets ends up?

15:20.360 --> 15:21.839
To cover up your mistake.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.525
You think that's the only reason?
Mum, this is why I'm leaving.

15:28.049 --> 15:31.480
I... haven't told you that yet, have I?

15:33.905 --> 15:37.360
I'm going to move with
Grace to the Gold Coast.

15:38.864 --> 15:41.853
She's looking to do a
placement at a larger practice

15:41.878 --> 15:45.381
and I want to try my
luck at a larger agency.

15:46.061 --> 15:47.239
Plus all the theme parks.

15:47.973 --> 15:49.173
I've been meaning to tell you...

15:49.198 --> 15:51.087
It must be good to be able to
come down here and play at this

15:51.112 --> 15:52.618
and leave when it's not fun anymore.

15:52.643 --> 15:53.160
No, it's...

15:53.185 --> 15:55.866
Daniel, this isn't like when
you ate all the Vitamin Cs.

15:55.891 --> 15:57.770
I can't send you to your room.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.719
You're running a business, my business.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.478
Now, I'm going to go and pick up Denise.

16:03.503 --> 16:06.367
I want you to come
and take responsibility

16:06.392 --> 16:08.439
as the manager you keep claiming to be.

16:08.590 --> 16:10.551
Well, what about the house?

16:10.707 --> 16:12.799
You were never going
to finish it in time.

16:13.171 --> 16:15.933
There's a melted basketball
in the oven, for God's sake.

16:28.809 --> 16:30.399
I really am sorry, Denise.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.720
I've had this house for 10 years.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.199
At least the windows aren't broken.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.959
Uh, yes, that's... that's true.

16:39.215 --> 16:43.117
I, um, I do have to warn you though,
the smell inside is quite strong.

16:43.142 --> 16:44.742
Let's get this over with.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.836
- Hi! You must be the owner. I'm Emma.
- Denise.

16:51.034 --> 16:53.389
Oh, actually, I wouldn't shake it,
sorry. I've just run out of soap.

16:53.414 --> 16:55.052
Please come in.

17:02.529 --> 17:07.559
So, by damaged and
revolting, you meant spotless.

17:07.752 --> 17:10.201
There was a bit of wear
and tear on the place,

17:10.226 --> 17:12.345
but nothing McCallum Real
Estate couldn't handle.

17:12.884 --> 17:14.999
Now, if you don't mind,
I might leave you to it,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.199
because I'm, let's not beat
around the bush, stinky and gross.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.752
It was very nice to meet you, Denise.

17:18.777 --> 17:20.416
I'll see you guys back at the office?

17:25.998 --> 17:27.280
I hired her.

17:30.411 --> 17:31.560
Em!

17:34.221 --> 17:36.119
- You saved me.
- Fluke.

17:36.673 --> 17:38.959
And a bunch of road workers
who owed me a favour.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.999
- The ones who trashed our house?
- Yep.

17:41.197 --> 17:43.519
One trash, one clean. We're even.

17:43.994 --> 17:45.160
I'm, um...

17:46.639 --> 17:48.559
I'm sorry about what I said.

17:48.842 --> 17:51.279
- I didn't... I didn't mean it.
- Yes, you did.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.920
Okay, I did, but I
could have said it nicer.

17:56.864 --> 17:58.039
You're not shit at your job.

17:58.242 --> 18:02.162
No, no, I... I am. You're right.

18:04.908 --> 18:06.279
Come with us.

18:06.506 --> 18:07.746
Hm?

18:09.304 --> 18:12.255
Come with Grace and I to the Gold Coast.

18:12.280 --> 18:16.439
I'll help you find work and you can
stay with us until you get settled.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.559
I don't want to hear
you have sex all night.

18:19.329 --> 18:22.098
First of all, thank you for the all
night thing, but I'm serious, Em.

18:22.123 --> 18:24.483
It'll be nice having
you in the same state.

18:26.745 --> 18:29.120
You really think you're
my babysitter, don't you?

18:50.163 --> 18:53.639
Denise thought the house
was perfect, because it was.

18:53.664 --> 18:55.655
- That's great.
- Yes, it is.

18:56.241 --> 18:57.839
It almost wasn't.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.095
Look, Mum, I...

19:00.430 --> 19:02.639
- I didn't...
- Can I have a job?

19:03.138 --> 19:04.559
- What?
- What?

19:05.217 --> 19:07.839
When Daniel leaves,
can I stay working here?

19:07.840 --> 19:10.679
I like it and I think...
No, I am, I'm good at it.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.320
And I'll get better.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.176
Are you going to be on time?

19:16.360 --> 19:18.560
Yes. I've got 20 clocks I can plug in.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.719
You'd need to study.

19:23.234 --> 19:26.202
I can't have you working for me
without the proper qualifications.

19:26.227 --> 19:27.279
I can do that.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.352
I've always wanted a framed
certificate with my name on it.

19:29.377 --> 19:32.200
The ones I make myself don't
cut it. Best Face? What's that?

19:35.937 --> 19:38.079
I think we can work something out.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.589
There would have been
a place for you too,

19:41.004 --> 19:42.488
if you'd wanted it.

20:02.829 --> 20:05.040
- Are you masturbating?
- Yes.

20:08.078 --> 20:10.660
- You heading to Grace's?
- Yeah, her parents are down.

20:10.685 --> 20:13.324
- I'm meeting them tonight.
- Wow, that's big.

20:13.529 --> 20:16.664
- Don't fart on them.
- That's a great tip.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.760
I am happy for you.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.717
This feels weird.

20:26.673 --> 20:28.062
Yeah, it does.

20:28.087 --> 20:30.479
- I don't know how to make it better.
- Me neither.

20:30.636 --> 20:32.756
Murder suicide?

20:35.624 --> 20:36.709
You're set on staying?

20:40.899 --> 20:42.815
Even without me to change your nappy?

20:43.278 --> 20:44.671
That's disgusting.

20:47.638 --> 20:50.760
I'm... I'm really glad you were here.

21:08.449 --> 21:10.162
Are you touching my butt?

21:10.722 --> 21:13.012
Yeah, it was getting too sad.

21:13.464 --> 21:14.720
Okay.

22:01.806 --> 22:05.526
_

22:17.661 --> 22:19.358
- Emma?
- Yes.

22:20.440 --> 22:24.359
Have you been signing off company
emails as Charlie's Angels?

22:24.477 --> 22:25.340
Yeah.

22:28.957 --> 22:30.600
- No?
- No.

23:14.429 --> 23:17.079
- Mrs Marsh, hello.
- Hello.

23:17.246 --> 23:18.679
I'm back.

23:18.680 --> 23:21.994
- Have you had a haircut?
- Ah, yeah, but, um...

23:22.019 --> 23:23.463
What are you doing here?

23:24.970 --> 23:27.245
Mum, hi. I, um...

23:29.343 --> 23:30.985
I'd like to apply for a job.

23:31.409 --> 23:32.879
Did you and Grace break up?

23:33.021 --> 23:36.541
Well, thanks for immediately thinking
that but, no, we're still together.

23:38.058 --> 23:41.429
Look, I, um... I've been
to all the theme parks now

23:41.454 --> 23:44.370
and had time to think.

23:44.698 --> 23:46.851
I... I don't want to miss
the chance to work with you.

23:46.876 --> 23:48.079
For you.

23:48.567 --> 23:50.255
Be here while you're here.

23:50.918 --> 23:52.181
You've been running this
place for a long time

23:52.206 --> 23:54.027
and, you know, when I
take over, I want to...

23:54.052 --> 23:55.339
Presumptuous.

23:56.099 --> 24:00.178
If I ever take over, I want
to learn from the best first.

24:00.779 --> 24:01.795
You know, instead of...

24:01.820 --> 24:04.467
Thinking you already know
everything and messing up.

24:04.538 --> 24:08.399
Well, I was going to say
teaching myself, but... yes.

24:08.865 --> 24:09.999
And Grace?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.719
She understood. We're going
to try long distance for a bit.

24:13.606 --> 24:14.778
If you'll have me.

24:18.195 --> 24:21.439
All right. Well, you'll need
to pass the interview process.

24:22.087 --> 24:23.799
- The...
- Emma?

24:24.835 --> 24:25.839
What's going on?

24:26.316 --> 24:29.599
Do you have time to do an
interview with a potential employee?

24:32.760 --> 24:34.640
Yes. Take a seat, please.

24:38.558 --> 24:39.759
Okay.

24:40.144 --> 24:42.172
So, what makes you
think you're qualified

24:42.197 --> 24:43.799
to work at McCallum Real Estate?

24:43.800 --> 24:47.826
Uh, well, I'm a team
player, I work hard,

24:48.037 --> 24:51.631
my last name is McCallum,
my mum is the boss

24:51.656 --> 24:54.519
and my best friend works here.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.479
- Mrs Marsh?
- Yes, Mrs Marsh.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.089
Well, I can't play favourites
over the other applicants.

25:00.114 --> 25:02.648
- Oh, I had them all killed, so...
- Did you?

25:02.673 --> 25:08.090
I like your initiative. Any final
words before I make my decision?

25:11.077 --> 25:12.200
I've missed you.

25:16.475 --> 25:18.999
Correct. You're hired. I'm Emma.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.039
- I'll be your boss...
- No.

25:21.241 --> 25:23.679
Okay, but I am employee of the month.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.422
- Did you put that up there?
- Yes.

25:25.447 --> 25:26.241
But Barbara hasn't told me

25:26.266 --> 25:27.915
- to take it down.
- Take that down.

25:30.693 --> 25:34.520
So, what made you give
up on the mainland?

25:36.449 --> 25:37.557
Couldn't hack it.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.239
- I'm glad you're back.
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.748
It's gonna be great. Every night
will be like a slumber party.

26:15.773 --> 26:16.843
Yeah, except now we're adults,

26:16.868 --> 26:17.986
so there will be no one
to tell us to go to bed.

26:18.011 --> 26:20.390
- Go to bed!
- Love you!
