01:16.165 --> 01:17.955
Yeah! Go, buddy, go!

01:19.585 --> 01:22.335
That baby's going scared. Ha-ha-ha.

01:23.505 --> 01:25.545
Whoo! Yeah!

01:25.715 --> 01:27.755
Hell, yeah!

01:27.925 --> 01:30.425
- Excited, yeah?
- Go, baby! Ooh!

01:30.595 --> 01:33.135
Yeah!

01:41.520 --> 01:42.855
I don't wanna do nothing--

01:47.444 --> 01:49.195
We got her, bro. Here we go.

01:49.363 --> 01:50.738
Give me one.

01:51.156 --> 01:52.490
Get them, get them, get them.

01:52.658 --> 01:53.866
Hey, boys!

01:54.034 --> 01:55.326
How y'all doing today?

01:55.494 --> 01:58.037
What are you looking at?
You wanna get shot?

01:58.205 --> 02:00.331
You wanna get shot? Woo-hoo!

02:01.917 --> 02:03.835
Go, baby!

02:04.753 --> 02:06.838
- Got it!
- Pearl Harbor! Pearl Harbor!

02:15.889 --> 02:17.724
Hey!

02:19.059 --> 02:20.727
And here's another one.

02:20.894 --> 02:22.478
Watch this, Billy Ray!

02:22.646 --> 02:23.688
Hundred points!

02:24.231 --> 02:26.232
Yeah!

02:35.242 --> 02:37.243
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Uh-huh.

03:03.145 --> 03:05.063
- Bye, Tonya.
- Bye.

03:15.908 --> 03:17.658
Clean up that mess, boy.

03:19.453 --> 03:20.953
- Pete, hungry?
- Huh?

03:21.121 --> 03:23.664
Hey. Ha-ha-ha.

03:24.291 --> 03:27.377
- Oh, you're not having anything?
- Yeah, I'm having them.

03:29.713 --> 03:31.464
Course, it's shit.

03:31.757 --> 03:33.466
- Bye, girls.
- Bye, Daddy.

03:33.634 --> 03:35.426
Let's go, Max.

03:37.930 --> 03:40.473
Get in the house, pup. Harry Rex.

03:40.641 --> 03:44.644
All those weekends, fishing,
drinking, lounging...

03:44.812 --> 03:48.314
...opportunities lost
to do-it-yourself house renovations.

03:48.482 --> 03:51.651
- Tragic, just tragic, Jake.
- Yeah.

03:53.153 --> 03:55.029
Makes Carla happy, my man.

03:55.197 --> 03:58.241
Spent four marriages trying to figure out
what makes women happy.

03:58.409 --> 03:59.867
You have spent four marriages...

04:00.035 --> 04:02.912
...trying to figure out what makes
you happy, who you kidding?

04:03.080 --> 04:05.206
Oh, yeah. Maybe that's it.

04:05.374 --> 04:06.666
Yeah, maybe.

04:06.834 --> 04:09.627
- Swiggy?
- Lord, please let my car be fixed today.

04:09.795 --> 04:11.629
Oh, dear.

04:27.104 --> 04:28.146
Hey, who's that?

04:31.191 --> 04:33.192
She looks a little young.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.403
- Hold this.
- What are you gonna do?

04:35.571 --> 04:39.323
You know how I say if they're old enough
to crawl, they're in the right position.

04:39.491 --> 04:41.993
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do? You crazy.

04:47.541 --> 04:50.376
- Whoo! Yeah! Fifty points!
- Ha-ha-ha.

04:50.544 --> 04:51.878
Yeah, you good, boy.

04:53.213 --> 04:54.672
Shut up!

04:55.090 --> 04:57.175
- Daddy!
- Hey!

05:00.471 --> 05:02.096
- Shut up.
- Daddy!

05:02.264 --> 05:04.223
Shut up.

05:04.808 --> 05:06.267
- I'll kill you.
- My turn.

05:08.937 --> 05:11.230
- Daddy!
- Shut up.

05:11.565 --> 05:13.399
Daddy.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.695
Yeah.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.366
Mom! Mama!

05:22.534 --> 05:25.161
Mom! Mama!

05:25.329 --> 05:27.079
Mom!

05:30.292 --> 05:32.168
Mama!

05:33.045 --> 05:34.587
Mom.

05:36.924 --> 05:39.133
- What is this?
- Groceries.

05:39.301 --> 05:42.094
- Y'all didn't see her?
- No, ma'am.

05:50.604 --> 05:52.146
Carl Lee! Stop!

05:52.314 --> 05:55.775
- You got a call from your wife!
- What? What?

06:23.262 --> 06:25.346
How many appointments
do we have today, Ethel?

06:25.514 --> 06:27.765
Not a one.

06:28.141 --> 06:31.102
But it is the 1st of the month again
and guess what.

06:31.270 --> 06:35.523
The checks are pouring in and we have
enough money to pay all our past debts.

06:35.691 --> 06:38.109
That'll be your last drink.

06:38.277 --> 06:41.404
Just keep us no more than
one month behind on any vendor, please.

06:41.572 --> 06:43.447
Why, you have been drinking.

06:43.615 --> 06:44.657
Two months.

06:44.825 --> 06:46.909
Well, these are the most delinquent.

06:47.077 --> 06:49.245
The rent's in there.

06:49.413 --> 06:54.709
I appreciate the practice, capitÃ¡n, I do,
but you could've left me a couple of clients.

07:02.009 --> 07:04.510
Baby, here's Daddy.

07:08.682 --> 07:11.058
Oh, no.

07:13.478 --> 07:16.689
I'm here, baby. Daddy's here.

07:16.857 --> 07:20.693
Daddy, I'm sorry I dropped the groceries.

07:20.861 --> 07:24.697
- That's all right, baby. It's all right, baby.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.

07:24.865 --> 07:26.699
That's all right.

07:52.726 --> 07:54.310
Look at this.

08:21.963 --> 08:23.047
Billy Ray?

08:23.882 --> 08:28.552
Sorry, sir, but we don't allow
no African-Americans in here. Ha, ha.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.722
Billy Ray Cobb, you and Mr. Willard
need to come with me.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.100
Hell, no. I ain't moving.

08:34.267 --> 08:37.311
- You know that little girl you took for a ride?
- Mm.

08:37.479 --> 08:40.731
- What little girl?
- I got bad news for you. She didn't die.

08:41.107 --> 08:45.194
So unless there's another redneck asshole
got a souped-up yellow pickup...

08:45.362 --> 08:47.780
...with a Confederate flag
in the windshield--

08:47.948 --> 08:51.409
Blue gums, why don't you take your
black ass out of here and grab a branch.

08:51.576 --> 08:55.621
Unless you got an explanation for what
this was doing in the bed of your truck...

08:56.623 --> 08:59.125
...you're going to jail. Now, get up.

09:00.168 --> 09:02.128
You can go to hell, nigger.

09:02.295 --> 09:04.755
- Unh! Goddamn!
- Hey!

09:08.969 --> 09:11.887
Now, you earned
the right to remain silent.

09:12.347 --> 09:15.099
- Here you go, just the way you like them.
- Thank you.

09:15.267 --> 09:17.935
- Dell, sugar, today I'm gonna have--
- Go to hell, Harry.

09:18.103 --> 09:20.521
On second thought,
I'm just gonna watch baby eat his.

09:20.689 --> 09:22.732
I am not the one
who handled her divorce.

09:22.899 --> 09:24.817
Can't she see
I'm shriveling away here?

09:24.985 --> 09:26.444
I'm shriveling.

09:26.611 --> 09:29.238
- Say, Jake?
- Yeah, what's up, Dwayne?

09:29.906 --> 09:32.825
Didn't you defend Billy Ray Cobb
few years back?

09:34.161 --> 09:36.203
What kind of case was it?

09:36.371 --> 09:37.830
Caught him selling dope.

09:37.998 --> 09:40.166
Spent time in Parchman.
Got out last year.

09:40.834 --> 09:43.419
No, I think some Memphis lawyer
handled that.

09:43.587 --> 09:45.254
Why do you ask?

09:45.422 --> 09:48.007
Well, we picked him up for rape.
Him and Pete Willard.

09:48.175 --> 09:49.341
Who'd they rape?

09:50.969 --> 09:52.511
You know Carl Lee Hailey?

09:52.888 --> 09:54.805
Sure, I defended his brother Lester.

09:57.058 --> 09:58.893
It was his little girl.

10:01.938 --> 10:03.063
Little Tonya?

10:04.483 --> 10:06.233
Yeah.

10:08.528 --> 10:09.612
How old is she?

10:11.281 --> 10:12.865
She's 10.

10:55.450 --> 10:58.327
Mr. Willard, I'm Sheriff Ozzie Walls.

10:59.037 --> 11:01.705
My mama voted for you.

11:03.208 --> 11:05.251
I seen you play for the Rams.

11:07.546 --> 11:11.298
Way I figure, a nigger sheriff's okay,
been on TV and all.

11:14.219 --> 11:15.511
No offense.

11:18.849 --> 11:20.349
What's your full name?

11:20.517 --> 11:22.935
James Lewis Willard.

11:26.439 --> 11:30.025
Four, which is a difference of 110.60.

11:33.446 --> 11:35.281
Who's there?

11:54.134 --> 11:55.968
Carl Lee.

12:01.433 --> 12:03.225
How is she?

12:04.185 --> 12:06.312
She holding on.

12:07.314 --> 12:10.107
Doctor says she ain't
out of the woods yet, though.

12:17.657 --> 12:20.367
They worked her over
something good, Jake.

12:27.834 --> 12:32.254
You remember them four white boys raped
that little black girl in the Delta last year?

12:34.758 --> 12:35.841
Yeah.

12:36.009 --> 12:37.843
They, uh....

12:38.011 --> 12:39.553
They got off, didn't they?

12:41.932 --> 12:43.432
Yeah.

12:48.104 --> 12:50.064
Jake....

12:50.523 --> 12:53.192
I was in a jam, you'd help me out,
wouldn't you?

12:55.445 --> 12:57.363
Sure, Carl Lee.

12:59.574 --> 13:01.408
What kind of jam you talking about?

13:02.452 --> 13:04.745
You got a daughter, Jake.

13:04.913 --> 13:06.789
What would you do?

13:17.467 --> 13:19.426
Dream some good dreams, baby girl.

13:19.761 --> 13:22.221
Good night, Daddy.

13:22.514 --> 13:24.390
Night, baby.

13:40.073 --> 13:42.116
- Is she asleep?
- Yeah.

13:42.325 --> 13:45.035
- Is she the sweetest thing?
- Yeah, she is.

13:45.203 --> 13:47.204
Next to you.

13:47.747 --> 13:52.251
Tell you what, I look at her, though, and
I cannot help but think about little Tonya.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.587
Don't.

13:58.425 --> 14:00.509
Don't do that to yourself.

14:01.261 --> 14:02.344
Yeah.

14:06.558 --> 14:07.599
Something else wrong?

14:09.060 --> 14:11.020
Tonya's father...

14:11.187 --> 14:13.272
...Carl Lee Hailey...

14:13.440 --> 14:14.773
...came by the office today.

14:17.027 --> 14:19.778
Man's heart is torn wide open, baby.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.530
I don't know, but...

14:21.698 --> 14:24.533
...sounded to me
like he was thinking about doing something.

14:24.701 --> 14:25.743
Like what?

14:27.454 --> 14:29.496
Something like maybe
killing those two boys.

14:30.123 --> 14:31.457
Was he serious?

14:35.420 --> 14:37.629
I don't know. I don't know.

14:37.797 --> 14:40.466
It could've been just the hurt talking,
you know?

14:40.967 --> 14:44.636
But when you think that it's possible
that those two animals could...

14:44.804 --> 14:46.680
...go free...

14:47.599 --> 14:49.975
...and be walking the streets....

14:52.479 --> 14:54.104
I....

14:54.856 --> 14:56.148
I don't know.

14:58.151 --> 15:02.029
After what that man has been through,
he's probably capable of anything.

15:03.323 --> 15:05.741
Somebody should do something.

15:06.326 --> 15:07.993
You should call Sheriff Walls.

15:09.579 --> 15:11.163
Yeah.

16:06.594 --> 16:09.763
To release the owner from assessment.

16:13.143 --> 16:17.563
I hope I'm having a heart attack
because then I'd get to sue you.

16:17.730 --> 16:20.399
Don't stand on ceremony, come on in.

16:20.567 --> 16:22.568
What? No clients?

16:22.735 --> 16:25.571
Just waiting to pick yours up
on appeal, Harry.

16:25.738 --> 16:29.074
And you, are you on vacation?

16:29.659 --> 16:31.785
Fortunately for me, my lovely...

16:31.953 --> 16:34.246
...divorce doesn't go on vacation.

16:34.622 --> 16:36.081
However...

16:36.249 --> 16:39.835
...not even the richest,
most ridiculous settlement I ever bring in...

16:40.003 --> 16:42.796
...is gonna be as satisfying
as watching those two hyenas...

16:42.964 --> 16:46.466
...across the street
get what's coming to them.

16:50.889 --> 16:52.139
Oh, dear.

16:54.934 --> 16:58.979
You know I'm a fool for those, um,
German-type convertibles.

17:00.732 --> 17:02.774
Come on, lover boy, let's get to court.

17:02.942 --> 17:05.861
Lucien thinks the two hyenas
just might get off.

17:06.029 --> 17:07.613
You saw Lucien?

17:07.780 --> 17:09.406
When? Where?

17:09.574 --> 17:10.656
How is he?

17:10.825 --> 17:12.701
Has he been eating any better?

17:15.579 --> 17:16.997
Just curious.

17:17.165 --> 17:19.499
Um, Miss Ethel...

17:19.666 --> 17:23.878
...refresh my recollection, how long
were you and Lucien together for exactly?

17:24.047 --> 17:25.255
We were never together.

17:25.423 --> 17:27.507
I was his secretary for 20 years.

17:27.675 --> 17:29.468
Come on, old girl.

17:29.636 --> 17:32.137
- You can tell us, you know.
- He was your boyfriend.

17:32.305 --> 17:36.225
I am an upstanding, God-fearing,
respectable Southern woman...

17:36.392 --> 17:40.520
...with unimpeachable morals
who has been happily married for 27 years.

17:40.688 --> 17:44.608
And I have never had
or ever will have any boyfriend.

17:44.776 --> 17:46.276
And if I did...

17:46.444 --> 17:51.531
...it certainly would not be
that old pickled scoundrel Lucien Wilbanks.

17:55.912 --> 17:58.622
She did him. Oh, yeah, a lot.

18:05.380 --> 18:07.673
All right, Billy Ray, step on back.

18:08.466 --> 18:10.759
Come on out. Willard.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.681
All right, boys, today's your big day.

18:15.848 --> 18:17.724
We're gonna take a trip
to the courthouse.

18:17.892 --> 18:19.559
The judge is gonna set your bail.

18:19.727 --> 18:22.521
Then we're gonna come back here,
all nice and peaceful-like.

18:22.689 --> 18:27.567
I get any trouble out of you,
I'm going to integrate this jail.

19:53.946 --> 19:57.366
Mama, Daddy's home!
Daddy's home!

19:58.034 --> 20:00.827
Hannah girl, let's go inside for a minute.

20:00.995 --> 20:03.538
Give Daddy some time to himself.

20:03.706 --> 20:07.292
- Let's-- Let's find a book, okay?
- I wanna see Daddy.

20:07.460 --> 20:08.919
Honey?

20:38.408 --> 20:43.036
Jake? Jake? Are you hurt?
Jake, what happened to you?

20:43.204 --> 20:46.039
Jake, honey, are you okay?
What happened to you?

20:46.207 --> 20:49.501
What is this? What is going on with you?
What happened?

20:49.669 --> 20:51.545
Jake, baby.

20:52.547 --> 20:54.756
What happened?

21:27.915 --> 21:30.041
Okay, okay.

21:46.142 --> 21:47.184
See you, Gwen.

22:01.282 --> 22:03.158
Is the sheriff gonna make a statement?

22:03.326 --> 22:05.118
He might, he might not. I don't know.

22:05.286 --> 22:07.913
- Is it first-degree murder?
- I'm not sure yet.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.081
What happened?
Can you tell us something?

22:10.249 --> 22:13.460
- Sheriff, will you give us a statement.
- I got no comment. No comment.

22:13.628 --> 22:16.588
Hey. Hey, Jake.
Hey, Jake, Carl Lee said you'd be coming.

22:16.756 --> 22:19.049
- Sir, are you an attorney?
- Are you an attorney?

22:19.217 --> 22:22.594
Now, I'll make a statement.
I want y'all to get these vans out of here.

22:22.762 --> 22:25.013
Sir, we've gotta get something
for our newscast.

22:44.825 --> 22:46.618
Didn't think I'd do it, did you?

22:50.373 --> 22:52.207
How you holding up?

22:56.462 --> 22:59.965
I ain't had nothing against them boys
till they messed with my baby.

23:00.883 --> 23:05.095
And I feel sorry for their mamas
and their daddies, but...

23:05.805 --> 23:07.764
...I ain't sorry for what I done.

23:11.018 --> 23:12.143
How's Looney?

23:14.981 --> 23:16.773
You blew his knee right off his leg.

23:17.650 --> 23:19.985
Doctors are still with him.

23:23.948 --> 23:25.448
What's gonna happen to me now?

23:26.951 --> 23:29.244
There's gonna be a preliminary hearing.

23:29.412 --> 23:31.705
Probably tomorrow.

23:32.164 --> 23:34.332
After that, Buckley will push
for a fast trial.

23:35.334 --> 23:36.459
Who's Buckley?

23:36.627 --> 23:38.128
Rufus Buckley.

23:38.296 --> 23:39.337
District attorney.

23:39.505 --> 23:43.508
He's mean, he's ambitious, and he's
gonna eat this up because of the publicity.

23:43.676 --> 23:45.468
But you've done beat him, ain't you?

23:45.970 --> 23:47.637
Yeah.

23:48.014 --> 23:49.639
Not in a murder case.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.978
Think I can win?

23:55.855 --> 23:58.231
All depends on the jury, Carl Lee.

23:59.358 --> 24:01.234
Pick the right jury, and you walk.

24:02.695 --> 24:04.696
DA picks the jury...

24:04.864 --> 24:06.156
...and you get the gas.

24:09.702 --> 24:11.328
Well, how much--?

24:11.495 --> 24:13.496
How much a case like this cost?

24:16.542 --> 24:17.917
Probably 50 grand.

24:20.171 --> 24:23.131
I can pay maybe 10.

24:29.972 --> 24:35.060
Well, not a lot of white lawyers
would've took my brother Lester's case.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.063
You did and got him off.

24:38.898 --> 24:44.486
I figure there's a lot of people out there
tired of all the raping and killing.

24:44.654 --> 24:48.615
They'd be sympathetic to a man
who took the law into his own hands...

24:48.783 --> 24:50.492
...even if he is black.

24:57.750 --> 25:01.670
You said you'd help me out
if I was in a jam, Jake.

25:02.088 --> 25:04.714
Well, I'm in one now.

25:05.925 --> 25:07.050
What you say?

25:09.679 --> 25:12.722
- What can you tell us, sheriff?
- Can you tell us what happened?

25:12.890 --> 25:15.558
- Are you with the police department?
- No, I am a lawyer.

25:15.726 --> 25:17.519
Are you Carl Lee Hailey's attorney?

25:18.479 --> 25:20.939
Sir, are you Mr. Hailey's attorney?

25:21.107 --> 25:22.273
Yes, I am.

25:22.441 --> 25:24.693
- What's your name, sir?
- Brigance. Jake Brigance.

25:24.860 --> 25:26.194
That's with one G.

25:33.828 --> 25:35.286
Hailey's hired an attorney.

25:35.996 --> 25:37.038
Jake Brigance.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.002
And today ain't even my birthday.

25:43.170 --> 25:46.548
Brigance couldn't tie his own tie
without that old drunk Wilbanks.

25:46.716 --> 25:48.675
Telling the press
he never lost a murder case.

25:48.843 --> 25:50.969
Well, he's never tried one against me,
has he?

25:51.137 --> 25:53.638
- What time's the preliminary?
- Tomorrow at 3.

25:53.806 --> 25:55.598
Judge Omar Noose presiding.

25:56.225 --> 25:58.643
Oh, I was wrong. It is my birthday.

25:59.019 --> 26:02.605
All right. First things first,
Brigance will file for a change of venue.

26:02.773 --> 26:05.817
- Guy would be a fool if he didn't.
- Why's that?

26:06.318 --> 26:07.444
Why?

26:07.611 --> 26:09.946
Should we tell our young,
uninformed law clerk...

26:10.114 --> 26:12.282
...the reality of jurisprudence
in this county?

26:12.450 --> 26:16.578
Evelyn, get me the state file
on race statistics.

26:16.746 --> 26:18.371
You see, Taylor, it's quite simple.

26:18.539 --> 26:21.624
This county's 26-, 30-percent black,
give or take.

26:21.792 --> 26:25.920
Almost every other county is 40-, 45-,
in some cases 70-percent black.

26:26.088 --> 26:28.214
Blacks are more sympathetic
to other blacks.

26:28.382 --> 26:31.468
If he gets it moved, he has
a greater chance of color in the jury.

26:31.635 --> 26:32.719
We know what that means.

26:32.887 --> 26:36.055
But if the trial stays here,
it's an all-white jury for sure.

26:36.223 --> 26:37.849
Now, Taylor, this is for you...

26:38.350 --> 26:40.894
...to integrate your brain with
before 3:00 tomorrow.

26:41.061 --> 26:43.396
- Yes.
- He means without blacks on the jury...

26:43.564 --> 26:45.565
...Hailey hasn't got a chance in hell.

26:45.733 --> 26:48.860
- All right, Noose is up for re-elect?
- Yeah, November.

26:49.028 --> 26:51.112
Reach out to our friends
in the legislature.

26:51.280 --> 26:54.908
Have them call on Noose. We're gonna
help him decide to keep this case in Canton.

26:55.075 --> 26:58.912
Also, send a case of whatever it is
he's drinking these days to Lucien Wilbanks.

26:59.079 --> 27:02.582
- I believe that's Dewars.
- Keep that old drunk on the sidelines.

27:02.750 --> 27:03.833
Yeah, get me Sam.

27:04.001 --> 27:05.752
And, gentlemen?

27:07.046 --> 27:10.256
No mistakes.
This is the one we've been waiting for.

27:11.050 --> 27:13.885
Justifiable homicide will never hold up.

27:14.053 --> 27:16.679
Then my only chance
is to find a shrink who'll testify...

27:16.847 --> 27:19.265
...Carl Lee was insane
at the time of the murders.

27:19.558 --> 27:23.728
Well, I might know a man
who owes me a favor.

27:24.396 --> 27:27.982
- You'll file for change of venue.
- Of course.

27:29.068 --> 27:31.736
Judge Noose denies it...

27:31.904 --> 27:35.406
...then you'll get an all-white jury
and you'll lose.

27:35.866 --> 27:37.325
Thank you for the encouragement.

27:37.493 --> 27:42.413
Well, bear in mind that Mr. Hailey
is as guilty as sin under our legal system.

27:42.581 --> 27:48.419
It does not permit vigilante violence,
and he took the law into his own hands.

27:48.587 --> 27:51.089
He murdered two people.

27:51.757 --> 27:56.135
Two people who had raped
his 10-year-old daughter.

27:58.264 --> 27:59.639
You know...

27:59.807 --> 28:02.058
...you can win this case...

28:02.226 --> 28:04.394
...and justice will prevail.

28:04.562 --> 28:06.145
But lose...

28:06.313 --> 28:10.692
...and justice will also prevail.
Now, that's a strange case.

28:10.860 --> 28:12.485
Yeah.

28:14.280 --> 28:16.489
I could use your help.

28:19.034 --> 28:21.911
The sons of bitches decertified me, Jake.

28:22.079 --> 28:25.456
I swore I will never
enter another courtroom ever.

28:25.624 --> 28:29.043
Lucien, you're the best lawyer
I've ever seen.

28:29.211 --> 28:32.213
Now, I know how much it hurt
when they took your license away...

28:32.381 --> 28:34.841
...but they can't take your mind
unless you let them.

28:36.135 --> 28:37.343
Good speech.

28:37.511 --> 28:39.637
Well, I had a good teacher.

28:39.805 --> 28:42.765
Now, you remember when I came to you
out of law school?

28:43.559 --> 28:45.351
In a ridiculous blue suit.

28:45.519 --> 28:46.895
Yeah.

28:47.062 --> 28:51.482
Now, you sat me down and you said to me,
"Young man, I cannot promise you riches.

28:51.817 --> 28:55.320
What I can offer you
is a chance to save the world...

28:55.487 --> 28:56.905
...one case at a time."

28:59.909 --> 29:03.161
Well, I'm saying the same words
back to you right now.

29:04.580 --> 29:05.705
How about it, Lucien?

29:09.209 --> 29:12.003
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

29:12.171 --> 29:15.298
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

29:15.466 --> 29:18.009
He leadeth me beside still waters.

29:18.177 --> 29:21.846
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

29:22.014 --> 29:26.351
...I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

29:26.518 --> 29:29.354
Thy rod and thy staff comfort me.

29:29.688 --> 29:32.899
Thou preparest a table before me....

29:33.067 --> 29:35.652
Sure am sorry about your brother,
Freddie.

29:36.612 --> 29:38.404
Old Willard too.

29:38.572 --> 29:40.907
Good boys, both.

29:45.663 --> 29:48.706
Ten years ago, that nigger would
be hanging by the end of a rope...

29:48.874 --> 29:50.792
...with his balls in his mouth.

29:50.960 --> 29:53.127
You tell me what's wrong
with this country.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.421
Klan would know what to do.

29:56.548 --> 29:58.508
My granddaddy, he was Klan.

29:59.593 --> 30:03.554
- Ain't no Klan around here for years.
- Oh, there's still some boys around.

30:03.722 --> 30:06.015
Them skinheads who want to
blow up the government?

30:06.183 --> 30:09.310
No, sir. Good God-fearing Klan.

30:11.689 --> 30:14.107
I got a friend, used to be active.

30:14.274 --> 30:15.400
I could give him a call.

30:17.236 --> 30:19.278
You do that, Winston.

30:19.446 --> 30:22.323
You tell them boys we need
some Klan down here in Canton.

30:22.491 --> 30:24.534
I mean right quick.

30:27.913 --> 30:28.955
Hurry up, honey.

30:29.123 --> 30:30.623
Coming, coming, coming.

30:30.791 --> 30:33.918
- Something you can tell us?
- What did Carl Lee tell you?

30:34.086 --> 30:35.712
There's Ozzie.

30:37.089 --> 30:41.259
- To our family's television debut.
- To the big time.

30:41.885 --> 30:45.638
I cannot believe he didn't take you seriously
when you warned him.

30:45.806 --> 30:49.183
Well, baby, you know, some folks
think those boys got what they deserved.

30:49.351 --> 30:52.687
Here, sweet pea. Carl Lee Hailey
may very well spend his life in prison.

30:52.855 --> 30:54.647
That is nothing his family deserves.

30:54.815 --> 30:56.107
- Yeah.
- You did call Ozzie--

30:56.275 --> 30:58.943
- Lookit here. Look who's--
- Daddy's on TV.

30:59.111 --> 31:03.072
I intend to show the men and women of the
South to look past color and see the truth.

31:03.240 --> 31:07.660
That here in the South-- In the new South,
justice is and will be colorblind.

31:10.247 --> 31:12.790
- Impressive. Honey, that was really good.
- Hmm?

31:12.958 --> 31:15.334
- Isn't Daddy smart?
- Mm-hm.

31:15.502 --> 31:16.961
Yeah. Brigance.

31:17.129 --> 31:18.296
- Mm-hm.
- That was great.

31:18.464 --> 31:20.548
Yeah. No, we just saw it.

31:20.716 --> 31:22.050
All right, Harry Rex. Yeah.

31:22.217 --> 31:23.426
Baby, I'm proud of you.

31:24.803 --> 31:26.137
- Good stuff, huh?
- Mm-hm.

31:26.305 --> 31:28.514
- You hear this?
- Put it on speakerphone.

31:28.682 --> 31:30.558
Don't be gross.

31:30.934 --> 31:34.062
- Ahem. F. Lee Bailey's office.
- Brigance.

31:34.229 --> 31:38.983
You nigger-loving son-of-a-bitch,
you won't live if the nigger walks.

31:39.151 --> 31:41.819
Hey, hey. Hey.

31:42.613 --> 31:44.655
Do you have any sympathy for the defense?

31:44.823 --> 31:47.825
Well, of course I do, Stephanie.
You're a mother, I'm a father.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.787
We all have families. Who wouldn't?

31:50.954 --> 31:53.289
Don't presume the district attorney
is insensitive.

31:53.457 --> 31:55.500
But the people
of the state of Mississippi...

31:55.667 --> 31:58.252
...entrusted this office
to uphold the law of the land.

31:58.420 --> 32:01.631
Our society cannot condone men
who take the law into their own hands.

32:01.799 --> 32:03.049
No matter the circumstance.

32:03.217 --> 32:05.885
If you get a conviction,
will you ask for the gas chamber?

32:06.053 --> 32:08.679
Yes, I will seek the death penalty
for Mr. Hailey.

32:08.847 --> 32:10.681
What do you think of Mr. Brigance?

32:10.849 --> 32:12.892
Isnât that boy still in law school?

32:13.060 --> 32:15.144
Say hey to your husband for me, Kim.
That's all.

32:29.868 --> 32:32.703
Hey, Cora Mae, don't you worry.
Hey, Wayne, how are you?

32:32.871 --> 32:34.455
Good luck.

32:36.041 --> 32:39.085
You plead him guilty today, I'll ask for life.
Otherwise, he dies.

32:39.253 --> 32:42.839
You drop your case now, and I won't
bury you before the entire county, Rufus.

32:44.299 --> 32:45.508
All rise.

32:47.344 --> 32:51.013
Court is in session.
The Honorable Omar Noose presiding.

32:51.181 --> 32:53.558
Good afternoon, citizens.

32:55.644 --> 32:57.228
Be seated.

32:57.396 --> 32:58.980
Counsel.

32:59.148 --> 33:00.731
And you, sir.

33:00.899 --> 33:03.401
- Are you Carl Lee Hailey?
- Yes, sir.

33:03.569 --> 33:07.572
Uh, Mr. Hailey, I am holding
a copy of an indictment returned...

33:07.739 --> 33:11.242
...by the grand jury of Mississippi
presenting that:

33:11.410 --> 33:16.122
"Carl Lee Hailey did murder Billy Ray Cobb,
a human being...

33:16.290 --> 33:19.125
...and James Lewis Willard,
a human being...

33:19.293 --> 33:23.337
...and did attempt to kill Dwayne Looney,
a peace officer...

33:23.505 --> 33:26.549
...against the peace and dignity
of the state of Mississippi."

33:26.967 --> 33:29.427
Now, do you understand
the charges against you?

33:29.887 --> 33:32.471
- Yes, sir.
- How do you wish to plead?

33:35.100 --> 33:36.350
Not guilty, Your Honor.

33:37.561 --> 33:40.980
The defense enters a plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity, Your Honor.

33:41.148 --> 33:43.149
Your trial is set for July 22.

33:43.317 --> 33:47.612
All pretrial motions and matters
should be filed no later than July 8.

33:47.779 --> 33:49.238
- Is there anything further?
- Yes.

33:49.406 --> 33:51.532
Your Honor,
in response to the insanity plea...

33:51.700 --> 33:54.785
...the state requests the defendant
be examined by its own doctors.

33:54.953 --> 33:55.953
Request granted.

33:56.121 --> 33:59.248
Additionally,
the state opposes any request for bail.

33:59.416 --> 34:01.334
Your Honor,
we haven't yet asked for bail.

34:01.501 --> 34:04.462
Now, Governor Buckley cannot oppose
a request until one is made.

34:04.630 --> 34:06.505
He should've learned that in law school.

34:06.673 --> 34:10.259
Your Honor, even Mr. Brigance's
meager legal experience...

34:10.427 --> 34:14.597
...should've taught him two things.
One, I have not been elected governor yet.

34:14.764 --> 34:17.641
And number two,
he is required to request bail.

34:17.809 --> 34:19.435
The state opposes any such request.

34:19.603 --> 34:22.980
In the future, why don't we just wait
till he makes the request, huh?

34:23.232 --> 34:24.440
Thank you, Your Honor.

34:24.608 --> 34:27.150
- Your Honor, we would like to request bail.
- Denied.

34:28.277 --> 34:30.696
I have never allowed bail
in a capital-murder case...

34:30.864 --> 34:34.199
...and don't feel
that an exception is called for today.

34:34.368 --> 34:35.493
Good enough.

34:35.661 --> 34:37.745
We will be filing for a change of venue.

34:37.913 --> 34:39.330
I anticipated this.

34:39.498 --> 34:42.083
Let me save you some time,
Mr. Brigance.

34:42.251 --> 34:43.751
Your motion is denied.

34:43.918 --> 34:45.835
Your Honor, we have not yet filed.

34:46.004 --> 34:49.882
We are simply indicating
our intent to file in writing by letting you--

34:50.050 --> 34:52.342
I said, request denied.

34:53.053 --> 34:54.428
Your Honor...

34:54.596 --> 34:57.807
...how can you summarily deny
this request?

34:57.975 --> 35:01.310
It is quite clear that Carl Lee Hailey
cannot receive a fair trial here.

35:01.478 --> 35:03.938
- Now, we feel--
- That's enough. Sidebar.

35:04.106 --> 35:05.523
Your Honor, we have a right--

35:05.691 --> 35:08.567
Mr. Brigance.

35:08.735 --> 35:12.280
I will not tolerate grandstanding
in my courtroom.

35:20.289 --> 35:22.290
Get back to work.

35:23.125 --> 35:26.043
Excellent technique, counselor.

35:38.015 --> 35:39.056
Your Honor.

35:39.308 --> 35:42.893
We feel it would be remiss not to tell you
that in State v. Johnson...

35:43.061 --> 35:44.687
...and State v. Fisher...

35:44.855 --> 35:46.689
...both in 1985...

35:46.857 --> 35:49.525
...failure to properly consider
a change of venue...

35:49.693 --> 35:53.112
...has been a reversible decision on appeal
to the state supreme court.

35:54.573 --> 35:59.452
No.... No trial judge
likes his rulings overturned.

35:59.619 --> 36:05.791
I guess you get to submit that brief after all.
Have it on my desk by Tuesday morning.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.919
Mr. Hailey, you are hereby ordered...

36:09.087 --> 36:14.175
...to remain in custody of
the Madison County sheriff until trial.

36:14.343 --> 36:15.384
Dismissed.

36:24.895 --> 36:27.646
Find me that state doctor.
What's his name? Rodeheaver.

36:27.814 --> 36:29.607
Get him down here to interview Hailey.

36:29.775 --> 36:33.611
Since he's not able to afford a real one,
find who Brigance is using for a shrink.

36:33.779 --> 36:36.781
- I want him discredited.
- You want professional or personal dirt?

36:36.948 --> 36:39.450
I don't wanna know how.
Get me enough to shatter him.

36:39.618 --> 36:41.494
We can do that. Taylor.

36:46.792 --> 36:50.836
This is $900, Carl Lee.
We said a thousand down.

36:51.004 --> 36:53.297
My kids gotta eat.

36:54.132 --> 36:55.883
Mine too.

36:58.345 --> 37:00.137
All right, when do I get the rest?

37:00.597 --> 37:03.849
Them folks over at the bank,
they won't loan me no money on my house.

37:04.017 --> 37:08.396
Why not? Your house is almost paid for.
You borrowed on it before for Lester's trial.

37:08.563 --> 37:10.147
Said I wasn't in jail before.

37:10.315 --> 37:13.025
Said to Gwen, how am I gonna pay
sitting on death row?

37:13.360 --> 37:15.694
And I lost my job at the mill.

37:15.862 --> 37:17.029
They called Gwen.

37:17.197 --> 37:21.283
Worked 20 years,
I'm out five days and they fired me.

37:23.662 --> 37:28.124
Carl Lee, I can't try
a capital-murder case for $900.

37:28.291 --> 37:30.084
Carl Lee, I need to live.

37:30.252 --> 37:32.002
Me too, Jake.

37:32.170 --> 37:33.754
I need to live too.

37:43.473 --> 37:45.307
Nice night.

37:50.856 --> 37:54.024
Finder of precedents,
mystery woman of the courthouse.

37:54.192 --> 37:57.153
Yup. Care for a beer?

37:59.906 --> 38:02.992
I assume that's the infamous
change-of-venue motion under your arm.

38:03.160 --> 38:04.827
Mm-hm.

38:04.995 --> 38:06.370
Ellen Roark. R-O-A-R-K.

38:06.538 --> 38:10.249
That's Roark in Boston,
but it seems to be Roark in Mississippi.

38:10.417 --> 38:12.710
- Boston, huh?
- Yup, I was born there.

38:12.878 --> 38:15.296
My father's the notorious Sheldon Roark.

38:15.464 --> 38:17.047
Attorney to the stars, yes.

38:17.215 --> 38:18.757
Duly impressed.

38:18.925 --> 38:22.011
What brings you to Mississippi, Roark?
Slumming?

38:22.179 --> 38:24.180
No, law school at Ole Miss.

38:24.347 --> 38:26.432
It's a.... It's a family tradition.

38:26.600 --> 38:30.728
Mom was a sweet little sorority girl there
till Dad-- Till Dad married her.

38:30.896 --> 38:34.231
I married a sweet little sorority girl
from Ole Miss myself.

38:34.399 --> 38:37.651
- Well, they have an excellent selection.
- Yes, they do.

38:37.819 --> 38:39.653
Now, really, what brings you to Canton?

38:39.821 --> 38:42.406
I'm not believing they don't have cars
to sit on on campus.

38:42.574 --> 38:43.949
Carl Lee Hailey.

38:46.495 --> 38:48.746
Really like to help you with the trial.

38:48.914 --> 38:50.789
Now, what makes you think I need help?

38:51.541 --> 38:53.792
You're trying one of the largest
murder cases...

38:53.960 --> 38:56.420
...these parts have seen
and you work alone.

38:56.588 --> 38:58.839
You have no paralegals,
no clerks, researchers...

38:59.007 --> 39:00.966
...nor can you afford to hire any...

39:01.134 --> 39:04.762
...so if Noose doesn't accept
that motion under your arm...

39:04.930 --> 39:09.517
...you go to trial in less than a month.
Trust me, you need help.

39:09.684 --> 39:13.437
- Now, how do you know this?
- Well, I'm an excellent researcher.

39:13.605 --> 39:15.648
- I see that.
- Look, I've played gofer...

39:15.815 --> 39:18.609
...for 7 capital-murder cases,
I've witnessed 2 executions...

39:18.777 --> 39:22.988
...I have written briefs for the ACLU,
I'm top 5 percent of my class...

39:23.156 --> 39:26.617
...editor of the law review,
I'm published, I'm young.

39:26.785 --> 39:27.910
And when I graduate...

39:28.078 --> 39:32.373
...I intend to spend a glorious career
stomping out the death penalty.

39:32.999 --> 39:36.252
Let's see, what else?
Oh, genius runs in my family.

39:36.419 --> 39:37.795
You'll get me on the way up...

39:37.963 --> 39:41.715
...and I really think, you know,
now is a good time to, you know, grab me.

39:41.883 --> 39:44.593
Mm-hm.
Is there anything else I should know?

39:44.761 --> 39:46.971
Uh, let's see, anything else?

39:47.138 --> 39:49.598
Oh, my father's filthy rich,
so I'll work for free.

39:51.893 --> 39:53.143
What do you think?

39:56.314 --> 39:59.149
I think I'll drop this brief off
in Noose's night slot.

39:59.734 --> 40:01.485
Go home and see my family.

40:01.653 --> 40:05.322
Thank you, Roark,
but I can handle the case myself.

40:07.492 --> 40:09.118
Uh....

40:09.286 --> 40:11.412
You might wanna
look at these precedents.

40:11.580 --> 40:14.123
Look at State v. Cooper
and State v. Roundtree.

40:14.291 --> 40:16.709
Both revenge killers, both acquitted.

40:20.005 --> 40:21.630
You'll change your mind.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.384
See you.

40:31.766 --> 40:34.184
Get out. Come on.

40:36.521 --> 40:37.521
Wait.

40:37.689 --> 40:39.231
Come on.

41:01.338 --> 41:06.508
Mr. Cobb, this is Stump Sisson,
grand dragon of Mississippi.

41:08.178 --> 41:10.512
He heard you were looking to see us.

41:11.389 --> 41:14.099
You were right to call us, Mr. Cobb.

41:15.226 --> 41:17.561
They say the Klan is dead.

41:19.147 --> 41:24.151
Klan don't show up for a few years
and people say the Klan is dead.

41:24.569 --> 41:27.279
Fact is, it just looks dead.

41:27.447 --> 41:30.658
The Klan has always been right there...

41:30.825 --> 41:32.993
...under the surface.

41:33.828 --> 41:38.374
Just waiting for the opportunity
to deliver God's justice.

41:39.417 --> 41:40.751
I wanna help.

41:40.919 --> 41:42.920
I wanna kill that nigger.

41:43.088 --> 41:46.799
Niggers got plenty
of protection nowadays.

41:47.634 --> 41:52.096
They got the NAACP and the ACLU.

41:52.263 --> 41:54.598
Even the federal government.

41:54.766 --> 41:56.392
Hell.

41:56.601 --> 41:59.478
White folks ain't got a chance.

42:00.522 --> 42:02.564
Except the Klan.

42:06.486 --> 42:08.070
I'm gonna tell you what.

42:09.989 --> 42:13.492
You get five or six of your friends
of similar thinking...

42:13.660 --> 42:17.955
...and we'll initiate
the Madison County Klavern.

42:19.374 --> 42:21.291
Even make you leader.

42:23.753 --> 42:25.546
Now, you tell me...

42:25.880 --> 42:27.464
...who's that nigger's lawyer?

42:28.508 --> 42:29.717
Local boy.

42:29.884 --> 42:33.178
His name's Brigance.
He's got a pretty good reputation.

42:35.265 --> 42:36.598
He got family?

42:36.766 --> 42:40.519
Yes, sir. He....
He has a wife and a daughter.

42:43.481 --> 42:44.857
Good.

43:04.627 --> 43:06.378
Two, two.

43:26.399 --> 43:28.734
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Now, calm down.

43:28.902 --> 43:30.569
- No.
- Come on, calm down.

43:30.737 --> 43:34.615
- Calm down.
- He has no right after what he did.

43:34.783 --> 43:36.575
No, he's got no right, sheriff.

43:36.743 --> 43:39.161
Don't get your mom upset now.

43:52.550 --> 43:54.259
Looney?

43:55.261 --> 43:56.512
Dwayne?

44:01.100 --> 44:03.894
I made Ozzie bring me.

44:08.608 --> 44:10.526
Shit, Dwayne, we--

44:10.693 --> 44:12.736
We known each other
since we was kids.

44:18.034 --> 44:19.409
It's my fault.

44:20.537 --> 44:22.246
No matter what gets said in court...

44:23.706 --> 44:28.001
...I knew what I was doing,
and I sure didn't intend to hurt you...

44:28.169 --> 44:29.586
...but just them two boys.

44:35.093 --> 44:38.136
I know it don't mean much now...

44:39.180 --> 44:40.389
...but I'm sorry.

44:48.523 --> 44:52.150
Some folks think that a black man
cannot receive a fair trial in the South.

44:52.610 --> 44:56.613
I intend to show the men and women of
the South will look past color and see truth.

44:56.781 --> 44:58.448
It sure is a nigger's world.

44:58.616 --> 45:00.075
Not for long.

45:02.287 --> 45:06.623
Boys, I am very proud
to invite you to become soldiers...

45:06.791 --> 45:09.793
...in the war to protect
our Christian homes and families.

45:09.961 --> 45:14.756
To resurrect our country
from the fires of racial degradation.

45:14.924 --> 45:20.679
And to make white people
the sole masters of our nation's destiny.

45:21.139 --> 45:23.432
What I'm saying, fellas...

45:24.142 --> 45:26.101
...it's time for the nigger to pay.

45:29.147 --> 45:33.191
- Something wrong with your telephone?
- No, we just had the number changed.

45:33.359 --> 45:35.068
That's what the operator said.

45:35.236 --> 45:37.362
- To an unlisted number.
- Yeah.

45:37.530 --> 45:39.656
I'm sorry you had to
come all the way up here.

45:39.824 --> 45:41.658
I should've called you, but this case--

45:41.826 --> 45:45.579
This case has us all worried sick
about you all, Jake.

45:45.747 --> 45:49.499
And you know this thing could get ugly.
And dangerous.

45:49.667 --> 45:52.961
Jake, he shot them in cold blood.

45:53.129 --> 45:57.090
They raped and almost murdered
his daughter, Sarah.

45:57.258 --> 45:59.384
What if the same thing
happened to Hannah?

45:59.552 --> 46:02.804
Brigance! Mr. Brigance! Mr. Brigance!

46:02.972 --> 46:05.599
- May we ask a few questions?
- Can we get a quote?

46:05.767 --> 46:07.351
- Mr. Brigance.
- Excuse me a second.

46:07.518 --> 46:09.519
I'm going to go take a few questions.

46:09.687 --> 46:12.564
- Jake, this isn't the time.
- This is really good for Carl Lee.

46:12.732 --> 46:14.358
I'll be right back.

46:15.735 --> 46:17.486
Thank y'all for coming.

46:22.367 --> 46:25.535
I guess we'll have to read about it
in the papers.

47:22.677 --> 47:23.885
Praise Jesus!

47:39.610 --> 47:42.154
- Reverend Agee?
- Yes.

47:42.321 --> 47:43.822
I'm Isaiah Street.

47:43.990 --> 47:46.616
Well, it's an honor to meet you,
Reverend.

47:46.784 --> 47:48.869
I saw you march with Dr. King.

47:49.037 --> 47:55.042
Well, well. The struggle continues today
here in Canton.

47:55.626 --> 47:57.919
Carl Lee Hailey's on trial
because he's black.

47:58.087 --> 47:59.379
No other reason.

48:00.631 --> 48:03.967
- These people are with the NAACP.
- Oh?

48:04.385 --> 48:06.386
- Reverend Agee.
- How do you do?

48:06.554 --> 48:07.637
How do you do?

48:07.972 --> 48:14.311
Reverend Agee, the black community's
concerned that Mr. Hailey's attorney...

48:14.479 --> 48:17.355
...is not sensitive to the needs
of the movement.

48:18.316 --> 48:23.695
The NAACP wishes to provide him
with a new lawyer.

48:25.823 --> 48:30.243
We need to raise funds
to support Carl Lee Hailey.

48:31.329 --> 48:34.331
I don't know, Reverend.
Time's awfully tight here.

48:36.334 --> 48:40.545
Obviously, we would expect you
to take...

48:40.713 --> 48:44.716
...a modest administration fee
for your troubles.

49:10.868 --> 49:17.332
Your loyalty has been forged
in a baptism of fire.

49:18.459 --> 49:22.879
Rise, knights of the Ku Klux Klan...

49:23.506 --> 49:28.176
...and let your brethren never regret...

49:29.220 --> 49:34.391
...they believed you worthy of fellowship.

49:39.730 --> 49:41.857
Welcome to the Klan.

49:53.828 --> 49:55.620
I need to talk to Jake Brigance.

49:55.788 --> 49:58.081
He's not in. May I ask who's calling?

49:58.666 --> 50:01.585
Uh, well--

50:01.794 --> 50:02.836
Mickey Mouse.

50:03.296 --> 50:05.213
- Who?
- Mickey Mouse.

50:06.007 --> 50:08.091
Get out right now.

50:08.259 --> 50:09.259
Who is this?

50:09.427 --> 50:12.179
Get your daughter
out of the house right now.

50:13.347 --> 50:14.723
Mommy!

50:14.891 --> 50:16.933
- Hannah?
- Mommy!

50:17.101 --> 50:20.520
Hannah? What is it? Oh, my God!

50:20.688 --> 50:22.981
Max! Max, come on!

50:23.149 --> 50:24.524
Fire! Aah!

50:32.533 --> 50:35.869
It's a good thing Hastings
was nearby and got here fast.

50:36.037 --> 50:38.455
The whole place could've burned down.

50:38.623 --> 50:41.208
- Yeah, I appreciate it.
- Take care, man.

50:41.375 --> 50:43.335
See you in the morning.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.801
She asleep, baby?

50:53.137 --> 50:56.389
The Ku Klux Klan
is burning crosses on our lawn, Jake.

50:56.557 --> 50:59.643
Baby, there's been
no Klan around here for years, okay?

50:59.810 --> 51:03.647
This is just a couple of dorks with too much
time on their hands and too many beers.

51:08.194 --> 51:10.445
- I'm sorry.
- About what?

51:11.989 --> 51:15.617
That you weren't home when someone
practically burned our house down?

51:15.785 --> 51:18.411
That you missed supper
and didn't even bother to call?

51:18.579 --> 51:21.665
That lately you've become more
interested in getting on the news...

51:21.832 --> 51:23.708
...than what's going on with your family?

51:23.876 --> 51:27.712
Or that Hannah comes home bawling
because of kids calling her a nigger-lover?

51:27.880 --> 51:30.966
What exactly are you sorry about, Jake?

51:39.350 --> 51:41.393
Remember the other night?

51:43.104 --> 51:45.647
I told you Carl Lee came by the office?

51:45.815 --> 51:48.191
Remember what we talked about then?

51:48.651 --> 51:50.652
About me calling Ozzie?

51:53.739 --> 51:56.449
You never called him, did you?

51:57.451 --> 51:58.910
You never called Sheriff Walls?

51:59.912 --> 52:01.705
I didn't call him, baby.

52:02.915 --> 52:06.751
Lord have mercy, Jake,
you had a responsibility.

52:06.919 --> 52:08.878
Carl Lee chose you.

52:09.046 --> 52:12.215
He told you what he was thinking.

52:12.383 --> 52:14.801
He told me what he was thinking,
but I didn't know--

52:14.969 --> 52:19.264
Jake Tyler Brigance,
we agreed, you were gonna call the sheriff.

52:19.432 --> 52:21.850
Now look at everything
that has happened.

52:22.560 --> 52:26.396
I am sorry to tell you this, darling,
but those two boys are in the ground...

52:26.564 --> 52:29.566
...and you were in a position
to prevent every bit of this.

52:29.734 --> 52:30.984
Mama?

52:32.445 --> 52:33.987
Are you and Daddy fighting?

52:35.531 --> 52:39.242
No, baby. Come here.
Come here, baby. Come here.

52:40.202 --> 52:43.788
Mommy's just upset because
some silly man played a real bad joke, okay?

52:43.956 --> 52:45.915
There's nothing to worry about.

52:46.334 --> 52:49.377
Nothing at all, okay?

52:55.009 --> 52:57.010
What that Memphis doctor say about her?

52:58.262 --> 52:59.888
She's doing good.

53:00.890 --> 53:02.432
Her jaw is healing.

53:02.600 --> 53:06.311
She can't run and jump yet,
but it won't be long.

53:07.605 --> 53:09.272
How about the other?

53:17.323 --> 53:20.158
There was too much damage.

53:21.327 --> 53:23.161
She ain't gonna never have kids.

53:31.629 --> 53:33.963
You know, I think about them two boys.

53:34.131 --> 53:35.715
Dead, buried...

53:35.883 --> 53:38.343
...probably starting to rot.

53:38.969 --> 53:41.805
And I remember them walking in court...

53:41.972 --> 53:43.890
...one proud, the other scared.

53:45.518 --> 53:47.602
I remember how they fell.

53:47.770 --> 53:52.816
One on top of the other, and screaming
and squirming and not going nowhere.

53:54.693 --> 53:57.362
God help me, Gwen, but...

53:59.073 --> 54:01.366
...that's the only thought
gives me comfort.

54:04.703 --> 54:07.789
They took up a collection for us
at church Sunday night.

54:08.541 --> 54:10.875
Some kind of defense fund.

54:11.627 --> 54:14.212
Reverend Agee gave a good service.

54:17.508 --> 54:23.847
We need some money around the house,
Carl Lee, for groceries and bills.

54:24.014 --> 54:25.306
How much you got?

54:27.017 --> 54:28.184
Less than 50.

54:30.187 --> 54:31.646
I'll think of something.

54:35.276 --> 54:39.195
How you think you going to get
some money while you stuck here in jail?

54:39.363 --> 54:40.989
Trust me, Gwen.

54:46.162 --> 54:47.954
I just get scared.

54:49.874 --> 54:51.541
Look here.

54:51.876 --> 54:57.672
Tell me exactly what Reverend Agee said
when he passed around the collection plate.

54:57.840 --> 55:01.050
I don't care.
We are dealing with life and death here.

55:01.218 --> 55:05.180
- I'm gonna have to talk to my supervisor.
- Well, you go talk. Get out of here.

55:05.347 --> 55:08.099
Morning, John.
How are things at the electric company?

55:08.267 --> 55:12.187
The electric company. That is the second
time this week I've had to hold him off.

55:12.354 --> 55:14.189
- How much do we owe?
- Two thousand dollars.

55:14.356 --> 55:17.317
- How much do we have?
- One hundred dollars.

55:17.485 --> 55:20.612
Now, look, this week nothing,
nothing has come in at all. Look.

55:20.779 --> 55:23.698
What about Buck Britt's retainer?
There's 2 grand.

55:23.866 --> 55:27.076
- That check bounced.
- What do you mean, bounced?

55:27.244 --> 55:28.995
It bounced, Jake.

55:29.163 --> 55:31.748
It's been sitting on your desk for a week.

55:31.916 --> 55:33.958
Not that you'd notice.

55:35.669 --> 55:39.172
Since you took this case, you--
You stopped talking to your clients...

55:39.340 --> 55:41.132
...you don't take your calls, you--

55:41.300 --> 55:45.178
You're obsessed. That's what you are.
You're obsessed, Jake.

55:45.679 --> 55:48.765
- Boy, your obsession is going to break us.
- Hey, hey, hey.

55:48.933 --> 55:51.601
What's wrong, girl?
We've been through hard times before.

55:51.769 --> 55:53.686
Oh, not like this, Jake.

55:53.854 --> 55:55.939
Not like this.

55:56.857 --> 55:58.858
We've been getting calls.

55:59.026 --> 56:00.193
At home.

56:00.361 --> 56:01.569
Threats.

56:02.947 --> 56:07.242
You know Bud has survived two strokes.
I don't think he would survive a third.

56:07.409 --> 56:08.618
Why didn't you tell me?

56:10.079 --> 56:11.955
Why, Jake?

56:12.122 --> 56:13.498
Would you drop the case?

56:19.338 --> 56:20.547
Jake Brigance's office.

56:20.714 --> 56:23.299
Until they cut the phones off.

56:24.134 --> 56:25.593
Oh, right.

56:26.345 --> 56:27.554
Okay.

56:27.721 --> 56:30.598
Right. That was Sheriff Walls.

56:30.766 --> 56:32.725
You better get down to that jail.

56:40.150 --> 56:42.318
What's going on here, Carl Lee?

56:42.486 --> 56:44.571
- I'm Isaiah Street.
- Jake Brigance.

56:44.738 --> 56:46.906
Uh-huh. Uh....

56:47.074 --> 56:49.158
- I believe you know Reverend Agee.
- Jake.

56:49.326 --> 56:51.494
- And this is--
- Norman Reinfield.

56:51.662 --> 56:53.913
I've seen your picture in the paper.

56:54.790 --> 56:57.500
I assume these boys carry your briefcase.

56:57.668 --> 57:00.336
Just a small part
of my legal defense team.

57:00.504 --> 57:01.879
Pleasure, Mr. Brigance.

57:02.047 --> 57:03.172
Mm-hm.

57:03.340 --> 57:05.717
If this is a party, boys,
where's the chips and beer?

57:06.176 --> 57:10.388
Otherwise, you being here seems a bit
like illegal client solicitation.

57:10.556 --> 57:12.682
With Carl Lee already
having a lawyer and all.

57:12.850 --> 57:14.601
Well, now, just a minute, Jake.

57:14.768 --> 57:16.769
Carl Lee invited us here.

57:18.981 --> 57:20.857
Mr. Brigance...

57:21.025 --> 57:23.318
...let me be frank.

57:23.485 --> 57:26.863
Mr. Hailey's case
has far-reaching ramifications.

57:27.364 --> 57:29.699
Carl Lee's acquittal
for the killings of two white men...

57:29.867 --> 57:32.201
...would do more
for black people in Mississippi...

57:32.369 --> 57:35.747
...than any event since
we integrated the schools.

57:35.914 --> 57:39.083
His conviction, on the other hand,
will be a slap at us.

57:39.251 --> 57:41.377
A symbol of deep-seated racism.

57:41.545 --> 57:43.796
Perhaps enough to ignite a nation.

57:44.214 --> 57:46.382
See how important this case is?

57:46.550 --> 57:49.093
Enter Mr. Reinfield's death squad, right?

57:49.261 --> 57:53.139
It's an unfortunate nickname,
but apropos.

57:53.307 --> 57:56.726
My lawyers and I handle
only capital-murder cases, Mr. Hailey.

57:56.894 --> 58:00.229
Yeah, and of all your cases, Norman,
how many are supposed to be lost...

58:00.397 --> 58:03.024
- ...so you can martyr the victim?
- Now, Mr. Brigance.

58:03.192 --> 58:08.071
How much a defense like that cost?

58:09.114 --> 58:10.657
Yeah.

58:11.533 --> 58:13.117
Would you say about 100,000?

58:13.285 --> 58:17.330
We are prepared to accept
7000 in litigation expenses.

58:17.498 --> 58:21.250
Well, Carl Lee doesn't have $7000.

58:21.418 --> 58:22.460
Do you, Carl Lee?

58:23.003 --> 58:28.591
The NAACP has raised $5000
for Carl Lee's legal defense fund.

58:28.759 --> 58:31.928
And we raised an additional
$2000 from the local churches.

58:32.096 --> 58:33.763
Let me ask you something, Reverend.

58:34.181 --> 58:37.141
How much of that cash
you offer my wife and kids?

58:37.309 --> 58:41.396
Well, that money is to go to pay
for lawyers' fees and stuff like that.

58:41.563 --> 58:43.690
That ain't what you told the church,
now, is it?

58:44.483 --> 58:46.359
You almost cried when you told them...

58:46.527 --> 58:50.738
...how my family might starve if they
didn't donate all they could, didn't you?

58:51.448 --> 58:54.158
Well, the money is for you
and your family, Carl Lee...

58:54.326 --> 58:57.286
...but we thought it'd be better spent
on your legal defense.

58:57.454 --> 59:00.123
Well, speaking of that defense fund...

59:00.290 --> 59:02.792
...can I use that for any lawyer I want?

59:02.960 --> 59:05.795
Well, it's not that simple, Carl Lee.

59:05.963 --> 59:08.840
Actually, it is that simple, Carl Lee.

59:09.007 --> 59:13.720
Unless the NAACP wants to go on record
as soliciting funds under false pretenses.

59:13.887 --> 59:17.098
Listen, Carl Lee, we raised that money...

59:17.266 --> 59:20.309
...for these men to get you out of here,
not for this cracker to--

59:20.477 --> 59:24.355
Now, hey, hey, hey.
Hold on. Hold on right there, now.

59:24.815 --> 59:28.401
Let me just get this straight here,
Reverend.

59:30.988 --> 59:34.407
If you don't give my wife that cash...

59:34.575 --> 59:38.453
...I'm gonna see to it everybody in this
town knows you're a lying crook.

59:39.121 --> 59:41.664
I'm sure your congregation
will be interested to know...

59:41.832 --> 59:45.042
...Gwen and the kids can't eat
because you want in with the NAACP.

59:45.210 --> 59:48.463
That's right.
By the time I get through with you...

59:48.630 --> 59:52.508
...you won't be able to collect 2 cents
in that collection plate on Sunday.

59:52.676 --> 59:56.846
We'll expect the check for the Hailey family
this afternoon, Reverend Agee.

59:57.806 --> 01:00:01.184
Reverend Street,
I sure do appreciate your fine work...

01:00:01.351 --> 01:00:03.561
...but I'm gonna take my chances
with Jake here.

01:00:05.731 --> 01:00:07.982
Thanks for coming down, Mr. Reinfield.

01:00:08.817 --> 01:00:12.320
Uh, and we'll be expecting that check
for Jake's legal services...

01:00:12.488 --> 01:00:14.489
...around the same time this afternoon.

01:00:18.619 --> 01:00:20.328
Good day, men.

01:00:27.127 --> 01:00:28.878
Go.

01:00:32.382 --> 01:00:33.883
Go.

01:00:34.593 --> 01:00:36.177
Good.

01:00:38.472 --> 01:00:40.556
You set that whole thing up, didn't you?

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:42.600
Couldn't have did it without you, Jake.

01:00:45.145 --> 01:00:47.021
Make one hell of a team, Carl Lee.

01:00:47.815 --> 01:00:50.900
You out there, Jake. I'm in here.

01:00:51.068 --> 01:00:52.401
We ain't no team.

01:01:17.094 --> 01:01:18.719
There's trouble.

01:01:20.264 --> 01:01:22.098
Oh, lookie there.

01:01:27.354 --> 01:01:29.146
No, here's trouble, Harry Rex.

01:01:37.906 --> 01:01:39.657
Hi. You are...?

01:01:39.825 --> 01:01:41.534
Roark, meet Mr. Harry Rex Vonner...

01:01:41.702 --> 01:01:45.288
...the most effective, connected,
morally compromised lawyer in the country.

01:01:45.455 --> 01:01:48.749
- Oh. Ellen Roark, brilliant law student.
- Do with me as you will.

01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:50.960
- Looking forward to it.
- Okay.

01:01:51.461 --> 01:01:54.297
Um, well,
thought this might interest you.

01:01:54.464 --> 01:01:58.843
In all murder trials, it seems the insanity
plea only makes up 1 percent overall.

01:01:59.011 --> 01:02:01.679
And of the 1 percent of that
that resulted in acquittal...

01:02:01.847 --> 01:02:03.806
...success rested almost wholly on the--

01:02:03.974 --> 01:02:08.352
On the defending psychiatrist regardless of
the quality of the psychological testimony.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.062
- Yeah.
- Shazam.

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:11.272
She is brilliant.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.524
"She." That would be me?

01:02:13.692 --> 01:02:15.985
- Now, who else would she be?
- So she would be me.

01:02:16.153 --> 01:02:18.863
She is saying that
if I take this plea to trial...

01:02:19.031 --> 01:02:22.658
...the verdict is going to hinge on whose
shrink the jury finds more credible.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.577
She would be correct.

01:02:25.162 --> 01:02:26.579
She would.

01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:29.206
So are you sure you don't need any help?

01:02:29.374 --> 01:02:32.835
I do. I'm hiring. Right now. Me.

01:02:33.337 --> 01:02:37.423
Roark, I am sure that I don't need any help.
Thank you, though.

01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:39.508
Okay.

01:02:39.676 --> 01:02:42.929
I guess that would just have
to be your loss, then, huh?

01:02:44.723 --> 01:02:47.099
Nice to meet you, Morally Compromised.

01:02:47.267 --> 01:02:48.476
Pleasure's all mine.

01:02:48.644 --> 01:02:50.186
She.

01:02:53.649 --> 01:02:57.109
Got to love the Lord
for making things like that.

01:02:57.277 --> 01:02:59.862
Sure you don't wanna at least
take a peak at her rÃ©sumÃ©?

01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:02.323
Not like you couldn't use the help.

01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:06.535
No, I don't want to look at her rÃ©sumÃ©,
Harry Rex, because I have you.

01:03:06.703 --> 01:03:08.788
- You do?
- Yeah, buddy.

01:03:08.956 --> 01:03:12.333
This is your chance to put aside
your shady sources, back-alley deals...

01:03:12.501 --> 01:03:16.045
...your greedy divorcÃ©es,
and do some real law for a change.

01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:19.590
Mr. Vonner, in short...

01:03:19.758 --> 01:03:23.386
...you now have the opportunity
to work on a case that matters.

01:03:24.221 --> 01:03:25.596
Let me get this straight.

01:03:25.764 --> 01:03:30.393
You want me to put aside my empty,
soulless, shady...

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.187
...astonishingly lucrative,
divorcÃ©e practice...

01:03:33.355 --> 01:03:37.400
...come work with you on an unwinnable,
bleeding-heart, lose-all-my-friends...

01:03:37.567 --> 01:03:40.069
...straight-to-the-gas-chamber case
because it matters?

01:03:40.237 --> 01:03:41.570
That is a novel idea, I know.

01:03:41.738 --> 01:03:43.990
No way, never,
presumptuous little shit.

01:03:46.743 --> 01:03:48.077
Good night, y'all.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.209
- Hello?
- I need the sheriff.

01:03:55.377 --> 01:03:58.713
- He's sleeping now.
- Well, get him up.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.591
- Who is this?
- Someone's gonna die tonight.

01:04:25.198 --> 01:04:27.491
- Unh!
- I got him!

01:04:28.326 --> 01:04:30.619
- Get his ass, Ozzie!
- What's in the case?

01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:43.090
- This thing's ticking.
- What's in the case?

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.593
I ain't saying, nigger.

01:04:49.598 --> 01:04:51.682
- Family out of the house?
- Yeah.

01:04:53.518 --> 01:04:54.769
It's locked.

01:04:59.691 --> 01:05:00.983
Now I want you to open that.

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:14.872
Oh, man....

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:18.292
Defuse it.

01:05:18.835 --> 01:05:23.339
I'm gonna take you
and this nigger-lover to hell with--

01:05:24.508 --> 01:05:27.676
Ain't nothing more dangerous
in this world than a fool with a cause.

01:05:27.844 --> 01:05:30.763
Lay that thing back down there.
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:05:30.931 --> 01:05:33.182
Carla loves this house.

01:05:52.369 --> 01:05:55.037
- How you doing, Stan?
- Hey, how you doing?

01:05:55.956 --> 01:05:56.997
Come here, girl.

01:05:58.208 --> 01:06:00.084
Mwah.

01:06:00.836 --> 01:06:03.212
Daddy, are you coming to Grandpa's too?

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:06.382
Mm-mm. Not this time, baby.
Daddy's gotta stay here and work.

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:08.467
You and your mama
have a good time, okay?

01:06:08.635 --> 01:06:11.095
- All right.
- All right. You be good.

01:06:11.429 --> 01:06:12.763
Go get your stuff down there.

01:06:14.015 --> 01:06:16.308
You said you'd withdraw
if it got too dangerous.

01:06:16.476 --> 01:06:17.560
I know.

01:06:17.727 --> 01:06:20.271
But I can't quit now, you know that.

01:06:20.814 --> 01:06:24.441
Carl Lee Hailey's facing the gas chamber,
baby. The man is counting on me.

01:06:25.485 --> 01:06:27.695
I understand that, Jake.

01:06:27.863 --> 01:06:30.364
I want you to remember
that we're counting on you too.

01:06:30.532 --> 01:06:32.867
What if something happens to you?

01:06:33.034 --> 01:06:35.911
Nothing's gonna happen to me, baby.
Come here.

01:06:36.371 --> 01:06:38.080
Give me a hug? Hmm?

01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:40.291
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:06:40.458 --> 01:06:43.169
I'm gonna be fine,
you're gonna be fine. Okay?

01:06:43.336 --> 01:06:45.004
Okay, babe?

01:06:46.214 --> 01:06:47.256
I promise.

01:06:49.551 --> 01:06:52.761
Watch you don't make your wife promises
you can't keep.

01:06:55.265 --> 01:06:56.599
Hannah?

01:06:56.766 --> 01:06:58.434
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.

01:06:58.602 --> 01:07:01.145
Last boarding call.

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:12.573
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

01:07:12.741 --> 01:07:14.450
Come in.

01:07:14.993 --> 01:07:16.452
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.038
You may come this way.
The judge is upstairs.

01:07:19.206 --> 01:07:20.873
Thank you, sir.

01:07:29.382 --> 01:07:30.966
Judge Noose.

01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:34.136
Thanks for coming.

01:07:35.597 --> 01:07:38.349
- Heard you had a little trouble last night.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:38.516 --> 01:07:41.560
Makes you wonder about
the sensibleness of taking this case.

01:07:41.728 --> 01:07:44.939
This is a beautiful place
you have here, judge.

01:07:45.106 --> 01:07:46.649
I'll get to the point.

01:07:46.816 --> 01:07:52.655
I've thoroughly reviewed
your brief request in that change of venue.

01:07:52.822 --> 01:07:57.910
And I agree with you. I think it's impossible
to find a fair and impartial jury in Canton.

01:07:58.078 --> 01:08:02.998
In fact, I think it's impossible to find a fair
and impartial jury anywhere in Mississippi.

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:04.541
And as such...

01:08:04.709 --> 01:08:07.127
...a jury here would be...

01:08:07.295 --> 01:08:10.256
...as fair as a jury anywhere else.

01:08:10.423 --> 01:08:14.843
So I've decided to deny your request
for a change of venue.

01:08:16.513 --> 01:08:18.138
Well, I guess that...

01:08:18.305 --> 01:08:19.890
...gives me something to appeal.

01:08:20.058 --> 01:08:22.685
Uh, actually, no.

01:08:22.852 --> 01:08:25.187
I spoke to Judge Dent...

01:08:25.354 --> 01:08:29.524
...and he led me to believe that the
supreme court would uphold my ruling.

01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:32.944
You certainly have
covered your bases, judge.

01:08:34.906 --> 01:08:38.617
Jake, you're a good lawyer.

01:08:39.286 --> 01:08:42.830
You're bright and ambitious. Talented.
You could be somebody around here.

01:08:42.997 --> 01:08:47.084
You sure you wanna be known
as the man that defended that murderer?

01:08:47.627 --> 01:08:50.087
Could be very unpopular.

01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:52.715
Talk to your client.

01:08:53.341 --> 01:08:54.716
He pleads guilty...

01:08:54.884 --> 01:08:57.428
...I'll recommend Buckley
accept a plea of manslaughter.

01:08:57.595 --> 01:08:58.845
He'd be out in 20.

01:08:59.639 --> 01:09:02.599
Yeah. And how's his wife supposed
to raise his family alone?

01:09:03.435 --> 01:09:05.102
Better than being a widow.

01:09:07.104 --> 01:09:08.731
Think about it.

01:09:08.898 --> 01:09:12.776
Why toss away a promising career, hmm?

01:09:15.613 --> 01:09:18.157
- Good day, judge.
- Thanks for coming.

01:09:22.746 --> 01:09:26.332
All right, Lucien.
Where the hell is this guy?

01:09:26.499 --> 01:09:28.417
Born alcoholic.

01:09:28.585 --> 01:09:31.170
But the man cannot hold his liquor.

01:09:31.337 --> 01:09:37.259
Jake, allow me to present
Dr. Willard Tyrell Bass.

01:09:37.426 --> 01:09:39.761
Expert witness for the defense.

01:09:39.929 --> 01:09:44.683
W.T., this is Jake Brigance, my protÃ©gÃ©.

01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:51.106
Dr. Bass.

01:09:55.403 --> 01:09:58.238
- Are you kidding me?
- No, relax.

01:09:58.406 --> 01:10:00.908
When he's sober, he's terrific.

01:10:01.785 --> 01:10:06.246
He has his license,
his credentials are impeccable.

01:10:10.085 --> 01:10:12.503
- Well?
- I need a drink.

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:14.463
Three in the afternoon?

01:10:14.631 --> 01:10:18.425
- My, oh, my. What would your wife say?
- I am my own man, Lucien.

01:10:18.593 --> 01:10:20.969
- I drink when I want.
- When did she leave town?

01:10:21.137 --> 01:10:23.389
- This morning.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.826
God! Unh!

01:10:48.248 --> 01:10:49.415
Bud?

01:10:56.005 --> 01:10:57.548
Oh, my--

01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.842
That's enough.

01:11:06.307 --> 01:11:08.016
Now, you tell your boss...

01:11:08.184 --> 01:11:11.103
...next time people are gonna die.

01:11:14.858 --> 01:11:16.567
Oh, Bud.

01:11:17.652 --> 01:11:19.570
Oh, Bud.

01:11:43.219 --> 01:11:44.761
Hi.

01:11:44.929 --> 01:11:45.971
Morning.

01:11:49.726 --> 01:11:51.727
Nice parking job. Late night?

01:11:58.735 --> 01:12:01.320
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

01:12:01.488 --> 01:12:03.489
So, um, here.

01:12:03.656 --> 01:12:07.576
- Oh, thank you.
- Your wife lets you sleep at the office?

01:12:08.077 --> 01:12:09.786
My wife left town.

01:12:09.954 --> 01:12:12.080
That's too bad.

01:12:12.582 --> 01:12:16.418
So listen, I heard that Judge Noose
turned down your change of venue.

01:12:16.836 --> 01:12:18.504
Yeah.

01:12:19.839 --> 01:12:22.382
I think it's time you let me
take you out to breakfast.

01:12:25.428 --> 01:12:26.512
Lunch.

01:12:28.723 --> 01:12:31.934
Quit playing with that food.
But, ladies, y'all come back.

01:12:32.101 --> 01:12:35.145
- You need to finish that before Christmas.
- Thank you, treasure.

01:12:35.313 --> 01:12:38.607
Now, the other night, you said
you're opposed to the death penalty.

01:12:38.775 --> 01:12:40.984
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

01:12:41.152 --> 01:12:42.486
- You're not?
- Mm-mm.

01:12:42.654 --> 01:12:44.488
Actually, I'm very much in favor of it.

01:12:44.656 --> 01:12:47.533
I'd like to go back to hangings
on the court lawn if we could.

01:12:48.368 --> 01:12:50.244
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

01:12:50.411 --> 01:12:54.373
The only problem with the death penalty,
Roark, is that we do not use it enough.

01:12:57.544 --> 01:13:00.170
Well, have you told
your client Carl Lee Hailey this?

01:13:00.338 --> 01:13:02.464
Carl Lee does not
deserve the death penalty.

01:13:02.632 --> 01:13:05.634
- The two men who raped his daughter did.
- How do you decide...

01:13:05.802 --> 01:13:07.135
...who dies and who doesn't?

01:13:07.303 --> 01:13:12.266
Well, simple. Okay, you take the crime
and you take the criminal.

01:13:12.433 --> 01:13:16.562
Now, say a crack dealer
guns down an undercover cop.

01:13:16.729 --> 01:13:19.481
Well, you strap his ass to the chair,
flip the switch.

01:13:19.649 --> 01:13:21.817
For some reason,
I thought you were a liberal.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.152
Well, I am a liberal, Roark.

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:28.198
What I am not
is a card-carrying ACLU radical.

01:13:28.575 --> 01:13:31.118
I do not believe in forgiveness,
nor in rehabilitation.

01:13:31.286 --> 01:13:35.205
I believe in safety. I believe in justice.

01:13:36.666 --> 01:13:39.835
I see. Well, let me ask you something.

01:13:40.003 --> 01:13:41.753
Have you ever seen a man executed?

01:13:43.256 --> 01:13:45.632
- Not that I recall.
- Then what I suggest you do...

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.509
...is you go watch a man be executed.

01:13:47.677 --> 01:13:51.471
You watch him die, watch him beg, watch
him kick and spit the life out of him...

01:13:51.639 --> 01:13:54.349
...until he pisses and shits in his pants,
until he's gone.

01:13:54.517 --> 01:13:57.603
Then you come back here
and sing this crap to me about justice--

01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:00.814
Roark, spare me your Northern,
liberal, cry-me-a-river...

01:14:00.982 --> 01:14:04.026
...we-are-the-only-enlightened-ones
bullshit.

01:14:04.193 --> 01:14:06.862
I'm so sorry, yes, you are the enlightened.
Yes, you are.

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:10.907
And that's why you brought me to this
black diner in this black neighborhood.

01:14:11.075 --> 01:14:15.245
So you can convince me you're
this JFK-meets-Jesus-Christ white boy.

01:14:15.413 --> 01:14:16.538
Is that what it is?

01:14:16.706 --> 01:14:19.583
Or because you're another repressed,
hypocritical provincial...

01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:23.211
...who maybe didn't want to be seen
around town with a woman like myself?

01:14:23.796 --> 01:14:26.048
Yes, you sure are enlightened.
You know what?

01:14:26.215 --> 01:14:30.052
I'm terribly sorry, I've made a mistake.
I thought you were one of the good guys.

01:14:30.219 --> 01:14:33.221
Thank you very much for your time,
Mr. Brigance.

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:49.821
Do it.

01:14:49.989 --> 01:14:52.199
I get a little worked up.

01:14:53.284 --> 01:14:56.078
Guess that's not the best way
to apply for a job, huh?

01:14:58.998 --> 01:15:03.418
I don't want the jury to see those pictures
of the dead rapists. Can we keep them out?

01:15:03.878 --> 01:15:04.920
No.

01:15:05.838 --> 01:15:08.924
It is vital that I admit the rape.
I want the jury to know details.

01:15:09.092 --> 01:15:11.301
I'm gonna need briefs on both.

01:15:11.469 --> 01:15:14.304
I don't like your politics, Roark,
but you do have passion...

01:15:14.472 --> 01:15:16.807
...and that's something
Carl Lee needs right now...

01:15:16.974 --> 01:15:18.934
...and maybe so do I.

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:22.104
Are you getting this?

01:15:22.271 --> 01:15:24.439
I'm writing it down.

01:15:24.982 --> 01:15:27.109
All right, here's what we got. It's official.

01:15:27.276 --> 01:15:30.445
The trial of Carl Lee Hailey
will be held in Canton.

01:15:30.613 --> 01:15:35.283
Today, presiding Judge Noose issued
150 summonses for potential jurors...

01:15:35.451 --> 01:15:36.868
...in a sealed envelope.

01:15:39.122 --> 01:15:40.956
Now, to prevent tampering...

01:15:41.124 --> 01:15:45.293
...that list will be kept strictly confidential
until jury selection begins on Wednesday.

01:15:45.461 --> 01:15:48.463
No one,
not even Mr. Brigance or myself...

01:15:48.631 --> 01:15:52.092
...will know the identities
of the potential jurors in this case.

01:16:10.862 --> 01:16:15.115
Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!

01:16:15.283 --> 01:16:17.743
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!

01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:20.829
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee!

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.877
Beautiful day, isn't it?

01:16:27.044 --> 01:16:28.879
There he is.

01:16:30.548 --> 01:16:33.008
- Any word on Bud?
- Ethel's still with him.

01:16:33.176 --> 01:16:34.509
Thank you for coming, sir.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.429
Well, well, well.

01:16:37.597 --> 01:16:39.890
The Pillsbury Doughboy.

01:16:40.057 --> 01:16:42.225
Still practicing exploitative law?

01:16:42.393 --> 01:16:43.518
Thought you were dead.

01:16:43.686 --> 01:16:45.896
I'm trying. Who do we have here?

01:16:46.063 --> 01:16:48.231
Miss Roark, I would like
to introduce to you--

01:16:48.399 --> 01:16:52.194
Lucien Wilbanks, third white man
in Mississippi to join the NAACP...

01:16:52.361 --> 01:16:55.155
...permanently disbarred
by the superior court...

01:16:55.323 --> 01:16:59.534
...for attacking police who busted
a picket line in the EPSO oil strike.

01:16:59.702 --> 01:17:01.995
It is a pleasure, Ms. Ark.

01:17:03.664 --> 01:17:06.875
All right, everybody,
jury selection begins this afternoon.

01:17:07.043 --> 01:17:10.462
Now, to win this case, we need
a sympathetic jury willing to acquit...

01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:13.715
...and a jury that can use
the insanity plea as an excuse to do so.

01:17:13.883 --> 01:17:15.008
I'm gonna need a drink.

01:17:15.384 --> 01:17:16.718
No drinking.

01:17:16.886 --> 01:17:19.429
What do you mean, no drinking?
It's my building...

01:17:19.597 --> 01:17:22.766
...built by my grandfather,
leased to you for a reasonable rent...

01:17:22.934 --> 01:17:24.059
...and I want a drink.

01:17:24.227 --> 01:17:27.646
Ms. Ark, I have all the respect
in the world for you.

01:17:27.814 --> 01:17:30.982
I believe in your right to equal pay,
equal work, to bear a child...

01:17:31.150 --> 01:17:35.111
...or to abort one. I think you
should be treated just like a man.

01:17:35.279 --> 01:17:37.197
And since you are a law clerk...

01:17:37.365 --> 01:17:38.990
...genderless in my eyes...

01:17:39.158 --> 01:17:41.868
...I think you should be
the one to go buy the beer.

01:17:42.036 --> 01:17:46.540
ERA she-woman, that would be
an excellent activity for you this afternoon.

01:17:46.707 --> 01:17:49.626
Hey. No drinking. Not today.

01:17:53.297 --> 01:17:56.424
Now, ahem, Noose selects
this panel at random.

01:17:56.592 --> 01:17:58.885
If we get too many bad candidates,
we're sunk.

01:17:59.178 --> 01:18:00.637
Luck of the draw.

01:18:00.805 --> 01:18:01.930
What you need...

01:18:02.098 --> 01:18:04.933
...is young fathers who wanna do
what Carl Lee Hailey did.

01:18:05.101 --> 01:18:08.103
Agreed. I think we need young men
with families here.

01:18:08.271 --> 01:18:11.606
Now, I would prefer no one over 50.
Less bigotry, as a rule, with youth.

01:18:11.774 --> 01:18:15.193
So we stay away from women,
rednecks and old men.

01:18:15.486 --> 01:18:17.529
Uh, citizens, thank you.

01:18:17.697 --> 01:18:20.740
Now, counsel, you each have
12 challenges. Let's begin.

01:18:22.952 --> 01:18:29.124
Your Honor, the state challenges
Jurors Number 6, 10 and 32.

01:18:29.292 --> 01:18:34.296
Your Honor,
the defense strikes Jurors 1, 4, 8 and 2.

01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:47.559
Twenty-six, 27, 28 and 31.

01:18:47.852 --> 01:18:51.688
Your Honor, the defense
also strikes Jurors 22 and 29.

01:18:57.403 --> 01:19:01.114
Now that's it, then. Mr. Brigance,
you're all out of challenges. We're done.

01:19:05.786 --> 01:19:10.040
Jurors, you will be sequestered
starting tonight.

01:19:10.207 --> 01:19:12.000
Opening statements begin
tomorrow morning.

01:19:13.836 --> 01:19:16.880
That's a jury of my peers?

01:19:17.673 --> 01:19:19.507
God bless America.

01:19:21.344 --> 01:19:23.303
My name is Stump Sisson...

01:19:23.471 --> 01:19:26.765
...and I'm proud to be a grand dragon...

01:19:26.933 --> 01:19:30.685
...for the Invisible Empire
of the Ku Klux Klan.

01:19:33.564 --> 01:19:34.940
What the hell?

01:19:35.107 --> 01:19:39.361
And I'm here to say that
the law-abiding white folks of Mississippi...

01:19:39.528 --> 01:19:46.034
...are sick and tired of niggers stealing,
raping, killing and getting away with it.

01:19:46.327 --> 01:19:48.411
Ozzie, let's get them out of here.

01:19:49.455 --> 01:19:50.830
We demand justice.

01:19:50.998 --> 01:19:54.250
We demand this nigger be convicted...

01:19:54.418 --> 01:19:59.255
...and his black ass
sent to the gas chamber.

01:19:59.423 --> 01:20:00.632
Who you calling nigger?

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.053
You pointy-headed, white-faced,
no-good, wife-beating son of a whore!

01:20:05.221 --> 01:20:06.805
Shut up, you wild animal!

01:20:06.973 --> 01:20:09.975
- Animal? You're the damn animal!
- I'll drag your ass out of here!

01:20:10.142 --> 01:20:11.851
- You're the damn animal!
- Unh!

01:20:16.357 --> 01:20:17.524
Come on!

01:20:18.067 --> 01:20:19.651
Come on!

01:20:25.324 --> 01:20:27.117
Come here, come here!

01:20:38.087 --> 01:20:39.337
That's right, go on!

01:20:52.226 --> 01:20:55.687
Hastings! Hastings! Hastings!

01:21:08.409 --> 01:21:10.160
What's going on?

01:21:19.670 --> 01:21:21.379
This is for Billy Ray.

01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:28.928
- Open! Open the gate!
- Open the gate!

01:21:42.068 --> 01:21:43.651
Turn around.

01:21:49.075 --> 01:21:51.326
I can't get to this.
Just take off your pants.

01:21:51.494 --> 01:21:53.536
Come on, Roark, do I look that easy?

01:21:53.913 --> 01:21:56.247
Are you afraid
I'm gonna see you in your underwear?

01:21:56.415 --> 01:21:59.834
With Carla gone, the laundry's piling up.
I'm not wearing any.

01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:02.670
It's all right, I haven't worn any in years.

01:22:03.672 --> 01:22:06.841
Look, I'm not gonna watch, I promise.
Now strip, please.

01:22:08.052 --> 01:22:10.136
All right. Fine. Batter up.

01:22:11.764 --> 01:22:14.766
- What I need from you, Roark--
- Do tell.

01:22:14.934 --> 01:22:18.478
--Is a way to discredit the state's shrink,
Dr. Rodeheaver.

01:22:18.646 --> 01:22:20.814
Unless you discredit the shrink....

01:22:20.981 --> 01:22:23.316
Carl Lee does not have a chance. Ow.

01:22:23.484 --> 01:22:24.526
Mm.

01:22:24.693 --> 01:22:26.528
Sorry. Sissy.

01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:29.781
I think he's got a very good chance.

01:22:31.158 --> 01:22:33.535
There you go. I think you're gonna live.
All right.

01:22:33.702 --> 01:22:35.411
Thanks. Whoo.

01:22:35.704 --> 01:22:37.455
Good butt.

01:22:40.459 --> 01:22:42.585
Ugh. So, uh....

01:22:42.878 --> 01:22:45.296
What do you folks do around here
to blow off steam...

01:22:45.464 --> 01:22:47.674
...besides trying to kill each other?

01:22:47.842 --> 01:22:53.930
You got discos or strip bars
or malls or anything to go to?

01:23:03.524 --> 01:23:04.607
Stump's dead.

01:23:08.737 --> 01:23:09.946
He's dead, Freddie.

01:23:12.366 --> 01:23:14.701
Come on, Freddie. Let's go on home.

01:23:14.869 --> 01:23:16.703
It's all over.

01:23:18.539 --> 01:23:20.707
It ain't near over.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.418
How you doing? Good to see you.
Excuse me.

01:23:23.586 --> 01:23:25.086
Hey, I'll be right back.

01:23:25.254 --> 01:23:26.921
- Here are your mud bugs.
- Mm-hm.

01:23:27.089 --> 01:23:28.339
There you go, darling.

01:23:28.507 --> 01:23:31.092
- Anything else?
- Yeah, a couple of dinner specials...

01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:33.178
...and some fried dill pickles.

01:23:33.345 --> 01:23:35.555
- You got it, honey.
- Thank you, Sugar.

01:23:36.473 --> 01:23:39.350
That wasn't sexist at all.
Really, I never order my own food.

01:23:40.269 --> 01:23:41.644
I can't do another shot.

01:23:42.271 --> 01:23:44.898
- All right, fine, I'll take another shot.
- Just a splash.

01:23:45.065 --> 01:23:46.941
Just a splash.

01:23:48.027 --> 01:23:49.068
All right.

01:23:49.236 --> 01:23:51.154
- To....
- To....

01:23:51.572 --> 01:23:52.614
Carl Lee Hailey.

01:23:52.781 --> 01:23:55.533
May our jury find that man loony
as a proverbial fruitcake.

01:23:55.701 --> 01:23:57.285
Hear, hear.

01:23:59.705 --> 01:24:00.997
No more.

01:24:03.125 --> 01:24:04.834
So, um....

01:24:06.212 --> 01:24:08.171
Do you think he was crazy
when he did it?

01:24:09.548 --> 01:24:11.799
No, he wasn't crazy.

01:24:11.967 --> 01:24:13.760
He told me he was gonna do it.

01:24:16.972 --> 01:24:20.308
I tried to tell myself he wasn't serious.

01:24:24.021 --> 01:24:26.481
I think I really wanted him to do it.

01:24:28.776 --> 01:24:31.819
I came home that night and I was looking
at Hannah laying there...

01:24:31.987 --> 01:24:33.863
...looking how tender she is.

01:24:34.657 --> 01:24:37.575
All I could think about
was all the monsters out there...

01:24:37.743 --> 01:24:40.954
...and any one of them can come steal
her innocence.

01:24:44.708 --> 01:24:46.668
Take her life, if they wanted.

01:24:54.301 --> 01:24:58.388
Yeah, I wanted those boys dead.
You're goddamn right I did.

01:25:05.479 --> 01:25:07.188
I guess I helped killed them.

01:25:11.151 --> 01:25:13.695
So tomorrow, when we get in court...

01:25:15.531 --> 01:25:18.157
...it's not just Carl Lee
I'm trying to get off.

01:25:37.052 --> 01:25:38.303
Burn in hell, Brigance!

01:25:51.734 --> 01:25:53.735
Good job.

01:25:56.613 --> 01:25:59.449
- Nice place--
- How is it you'll drive an hour and half...

01:25:59.616 --> 01:26:03.661
...outside of town to take me to dinner,
but you have no problem...

01:26:03.829 --> 01:26:06.247
...walking me into my motel room?

01:26:06.415 --> 01:26:08.416
Well, with everything that's going on...

01:26:08.584 --> 01:26:10.918
...I don't think we can be too careful.

01:26:11.086 --> 01:26:13.629
Just wanna make sure
it's all safe in here.

01:26:13.797 --> 01:26:15.340
I'm not scared.

01:26:15.507 --> 01:26:18.509
- Oh, yes, I am.
- Of what?

01:26:19.053 --> 01:26:21.387
Of what's going to happen tomorrow.

01:26:21.722 --> 01:26:24.891
All the other cases I've worked on
have only been paper defendants.

01:26:25.059 --> 01:26:29.520
It's just I never knew the towns,
and I never touched the lives or anything.

01:26:29.688 --> 01:26:31.814
So I don't know what it's like.

01:26:38.113 --> 01:26:40.114
Tomorrow morning...

01:26:40.282 --> 01:26:43.868
...Buckley will try to kill Carl Lee Hailey.

01:26:44.453 --> 01:26:46.871
Now, it's on us to stop him.

01:26:47.039 --> 01:26:48.790
Mm-hm.

01:26:49.583 --> 01:26:51.626
So tonight,
go over the battle in your mind.

01:26:51.794 --> 01:26:54.796
Argument, rebuttal,
examination and cross. All of it.

01:26:55.005 --> 01:26:56.172
Mm-hm.

01:26:56.673 --> 01:26:58.800
- Remember something.
- Hmm.

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:03.471
- You are one of the good guys.
- Okay.

01:27:03.972 --> 01:27:07.642
- And good guy has the spicy on her lip.
- Spicy.

01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:10.395
But still one of the good guys.

01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:25.410
I'm going home.

01:27:25.828 --> 01:27:29.580
Lock the door behind me, Roark.
I'll see you in the morning.

01:27:43.137 --> 01:27:45.179
It's gonna blow, sheriff. It's gonna blow.

01:27:49.017 --> 01:27:51.310
Oz is right over there!

01:27:55.941 --> 01:27:58.109
Wait. Wait. Hold it, Jake. Hold it, Jake.

01:27:58.277 --> 01:27:59.485
- My dog's in there.
- Jake--

01:27:59.653 --> 01:28:01.112
My dog's in there!

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:02.321
Max!

01:28:02.489 --> 01:28:04.532
Come on. Come on.

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.534
Max!

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.246
Max!

01:28:16.044 --> 01:28:17.879
It's too late.

01:28:38.484 --> 01:28:40.818
Move, move, move.

01:29:18.607 --> 01:29:20.191
Hey, buddy.

01:29:21.318 --> 01:29:22.652
Seen my dog?

01:29:23.111 --> 01:29:24.570
Looking for my dog.

01:29:24.738 --> 01:29:28.699
Max, come here, boy! Let's go!
Come on, Max!

01:29:30.452 --> 01:29:36.332
I booked you on the 9:15 to Gulfport.
Economy, of course.

01:29:36.625 --> 01:29:38.334
Go see your wife and daughter, Jake.

01:29:40.587 --> 01:29:43.005
What'd you do that for, Harry Rex?

01:29:43.215 --> 01:29:45.132
We got trial in less than three hours.

01:29:45.467 --> 01:29:46.509
Oh, come on.

01:29:46.677 --> 01:29:49.053
Noose would give you a continuance
in a flash.

01:29:49.221 --> 01:29:53.182
NAACP boys be down here before lunch.
Drooling.

01:29:53.934 --> 01:29:56.978
Max, let's go, boy! Come on!

01:29:57.854 --> 01:29:59.689
Jake, listen to me.

01:30:00.232 --> 01:30:03.568
Your marriage is on the rocks,
you're about to have an affair.

01:30:03.735 --> 01:30:07.238
Your career's in ruins if you're lucky,
and if you're not, you're dead.

01:30:08.782 --> 01:30:10.283
Don't get me wrong, my friend.

01:30:11.243 --> 01:30:14.161
What you've put into this case,
you even inspired me, and I'm--

01:30:14.329 --> 01:30:16.372
I'm uninspirable.

01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:18.249
Do everyone a favor, though.

01:30:18.417 --> 01:30:20.501
Drop the case.

01:30:23.839 --> 01:30:26.173
No, I can't.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:29.343
I won't. I'm not gonna quit.

01:30:30.304 --> 01:30:32.763
I quit now, and all this is for nothing. No.

01:30:36.351 --> 01:30:39.103
Max, come on now.
Max, where are you? Come on, Max!

01:30:39.271 --> 01:30:41.647
Max is dead, and you're next.

01:30:42.733 --> 01:30:44.609
Walk away.

01:30:54.369 --> 01:30:56.996
Max. Come here, boy.

01:30:57.873 --> 01:30:59.790
Come here. Come here, boy. Ha-ha-ha.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.500
Come here. Come here.

01:31:01.668 --> 01:31:03.878
Who's got the goods, huh? Huh?

01:31:06.423 --> 01:31:09.050
Pretrial strategy at my office
in less than two hours...

01:31:09.217 --> 01:31:11.886
...and I expect to see your ass there.

01:31:12.262 --> 01:31:15.181
Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!

01:31:15.349 --> 01:31:18.684
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee!

01:31:26.652 --> 01:31:28.653
Fry Carl Lee.

01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:31.280
Free Carl Lee!

01:31:32.991 --> 01:31:35.368
Fry Carl Lee! Fry Carl Lee! Fry Carl Lee!

01:31:35.535 --> 01:31:36.744
Free Carl Lee!

01:31:39.665 --> 01:31:41.999
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!

01:31:46.046 --> 01:31:49.674
Fry Carl Lee! Fry Carl Lee! Fry Carl Lee!

01:31:49.841 --> 01:31:54.303
Fry Carl Lee! Fry Carl Lee! Fry Carl Lee!

01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:04.897
Now, Mr. Buckley, you may begin.

01:32:05.065 --> 01:32:06.941
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:32:09.778 --> 01:32:12.405
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:32:14.324 --> 01:32:18.994
You are Cora Mae Cobb, the mother of
Billy Ray Cobb the deceased, are you not?

01:32:19.162 --> 01:32:20.621
Yes, sir.

01:32:20.789 --> 01:32:23.207
And where were you
when your son was murdered?

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:26.711
I was right outside that door right there.

01:32:26.878 --> 01:32:29.672
Me and Freddie was waiting
for his hearing.

01:32:30.173 --> 01:32:32.174
He was walking up the stairs...

01:32:32.342 --> 01:32:34.135
...in handcuffs.

01:32:34.428 --> 01:32:38.013
Can you tell us how old your son was
at the time of his death?

01:32:39.391 --> 01:32:40.474
Twenty-three.

01:32:42.352 --> 01:32:44.520
You say your son was 23 when he died?

01:32:44.938 --> 01:32:45.980
Yes.

01:32:46.148 --> 01:32:49.066
In those 23 years, Mrs. Cobb...

01:32:49.234 --> 01:32:51.360
...how many other children
did your son kidnap?

01:32:51.528 --> 01:32:53.320
Objection, Your Honor! Objection!

01:32:53.488 --> 01:32:57.116
Sustained. You--
You are out of order, Mr. Brigance.

01:32:57.284 --> 01:32:59.952
- Withdraw the question.
- The jury will disregard...

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:02.288
...the last question from Mr. Brigance.

01:33:03.165 --> 01:33:06.584
Mrs. Cobb, in your son's 23 years...

01:33:06.752 --> 01:33:08.794
...how many other children did he rape?

01:33:08.962 --> 01:33:11.589
Mr. Brigance. In my chambers.

01:33:12.674 --> 01:33:14.008
Court will recess for lunch.

01:33:16.845 --> 01:33:19.430
I don't get it.
Why is he antagonizing the judge?

01:33:19.598 --> 01:33:21.849
He should've known
Noose'd pull him into chambers.

01:33:22.017 --> 01:33:26.270
Of course he knew. Jake got to draw first
blood and he knows that's more important.

01:33:27.397 --> 01:33:29.273
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Rufie.

01:33:29.441 --> 01:33:33.319
- Sweetheart, come play on a winning team.
- How's that impotence thing, Rufus?

01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:39.533
You're not being paid
for the work you're doing, are you?

01:33:39.701 --> 01:33:40.785
No, sir.

01:33:42.204 --> 01:33:44.622
Well, I guess Jake's paying you
in other ways, then, isn't he?

01:33:46.792 --> 01:33:47.875
Impotence?

01:33:48.043 --> 01:33:49.668
Yep. Girls talk.

01:33:49.836 --> 01:33:54.673
Sheriff, if you would,
will you please identify this weapon?

01:33:54.841 --> 01:33:56.425
It's the weapon found
at the scene.

01:33:57.135 --> 01:34:01.138
And were you able to identify
any of the fingerprints found on this gun?

01:34:01.389 --> 01:34:04.600
Yes. The prints on the gun
matched those of Carl Lee Hailey.

01:34:04.768 --> 01:34:06.227
You're sure?

01:34:06.728 --> 01:34:08.062
Yes.

01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:12.441
Your Honor, I'd like to enter this
into evidence as Exhibit S18.

01:34:12.609 --> 01:34:14.860
We have no further use of this witness.

01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:20.991
Sheriff Walls.

01:34:22.369 --> 01:34:24.286
Did you arrest Cobb and Willard?

01:34:24.454 --> 01:34:25.955
Yes, I did.

01:34:26.122 --> 01:34:28.165
I arrested them for the rape...

01:34:28.333 --> 01:34:32.253
...and attempted murder
of 10-year-old Tonya Hailey.

01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:34.046
And is it true that Pete Willard...

01:34:34.214 --> 01:34:36.006
...signed a written confession...

01:34:36.174 --> 01:34:39.844
...saying that he and Billy Ray Cobb
did rape Tonya Hailey?

01:34:40.011 --> 01:34:42.930
Objection. That's inadmissible,
and Mr. Brigance knows it.

01:34:43.098 --> 01:34:45.933
Mr. Brigance,
I've spoken to you before.

01:34:46.101 --> 01:34:48.936
We are not trying the rape
of Miss Hailey today...

01:34:49.104 --> 01:34:53.774
...but the murder of two young men,
and if you continue in this performance...

01:34:54.609 --> 01:34:56.235
...I'll hold you in contempt.

01:34:56.486 --> 01:34:57.987
Now, is that understood?

01:34:58.989 --> 01:35:00.531
Yes, sir.

01:35:01.867 --> 01:35:04.118
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

01:35:04.286 --> 01:35:05.953
Yes.

01:35:07.122 --> 01:35:09.081
You say something, sheriff?

01:35:10.959 --> 01:35:14.128
- Yes, he did sign a confession.
- Objection, Your Honor!

01:35:14.546 --> 01:35:19.550
Jurors, you will disregard
the last remark of Sheriff Walls.

01:35:19.718 --> 01:35:23.679
Court is adjourned
till tomorrow morning 9:00.

01:35:44.659 --> 01:35:46.869
I'm taking Bud back to Oxford.

01:35:48.455 --> 01:35:50.748
He always missed Oxford.

01:36:07.641 --> 01:36:10.100
I don't know what to say,
Ethel, I don't know.

01:36:10.268 --> 01:36:12.770
There's nothing you can say.

01:36:14.022 --> 01:36:17.191
I know you didn't want
any of this to happen...

01:36:17.359 --> 01:36:19.276
...but it happened all the same.

01:36:21.196 --> 01:36:24.615
You wagered all our lives on this.

01:36:25.075 --> 01:36:29.703
You just went ahead and did what you
felt you had to do, no matter what the cost.

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.000
Some folks think that's brave.

01:36:35.877 --> 01:36:38.003
Not me, Jake.

01:36:38.922 --> 01:36:40.839
Now, you may win...

01:36:41.466 --> 01:36:44.343
...but I think we've all lost here.

01:36:51.059 --> 01:36:56.897
- Would you help an old lady to her car?
- You don't need any help, Ethel...

01:36:57.065 --> 01:37:01.527
...but it would be my honor
to escort you to your automobile.

01:37:16.001 --> 01:37:17.960
Didn't like that one?

01:37:18.378 --> 01:37:20.337
Buckley is presenting
his shrink tomorrow.

01:37:20.505 --> 01:37:23.632
I can't come up with one way
to bring him down. Not one.

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:28.053
I keep asking myself, "What would
Jake do? What would my father do?

01:37:28.221 --> 01:37:29.263
What would Lucien do?"

01:37:29.431 --> 01:37:31.724
That's your problem right there.

01:37:31.891 --> 01:37:35.769
What you gotta ask yourself is,
"What would Harry Rex do?"

01:37:35.937 --> 01:37:37.521
What would Harry Rex do?

01:37:37.689 --> 01:37:39.023
Cheat.

01:37:39.190 --> 01:37:40.607
Cheat like crazy.

01:37:45.113 --> 01:37:46.113
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

01:37:46.281 --> 01:37:49.116
I'll bring her around the side.

01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:53.203
Uh-huh.

01:37:53.371 --> 01:37:54.872
- Hey, Cheryl.
- Hi.

01:37:56.666 --> 01:37:58.167
So we gotta talk about it.

01:37:58.752 --> 01:38:00.044
Now, wait a minute.

01:38:00.211 --> 01:38:03.088
The judge said absolutely
not to discuss this case.

01:38:03.256 --> 01:38:05.799
That judge ain't stuck here
away from his wife and kids.

01:38:05.967 --> 01:38:09.845
The sooner we start talking about it,
the sooner we can get home.

01:38:10.013 --> 01:38:12.473
I wanna get out of here
just as much as anybody else.

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.475
Let's get on with it.

01:38:16.478 --> 01:38:17.895
Undecided?

01:38:21.232 --> 01:38:22.733
Four.

01:38:22.901 --> 01:38:24.777
Guilty?

01:38:29.491 --> 01:38:31.325
Seven.

01:38:31.993 --> 01:38:33.035
Not guilty?

01:38:37.665 --> 01:38:40.000
That nigger's dead, y'all.

01:38:58.186 --> 01:39:01.688
I know, I know. Folks in town
just can't get enough of this trial.

01:39:01.856 --> 01:39:06.026
And that's why my editor said I needed
to come down and interview Rodeheaver.

01:39:06.569 --> 01:39:08.946
I'm afraid
Dr. Rodeheaver's in court today.

01:39:09.489 --> 01:39:10.531
Oh.

01:39:11.074 --> 01:39:13.534
If a pretty girl like you
wants to be a reporter...

01:39:13.701 --> 01:39:15.702
...maybe she should do
some better research?

01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:16.912
Yeah. Ha.

01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.374
Well, um, you know what?
I don't-- I don't mind waiting...

01:39:20.542 --> 01:39:23.043
...because my paper really wants
this interview...

01:39:23.211 --> 01:39:25.462
...so is he still in Room 369?
I'll just go there.

01:39:25.630 --> 01:39:29.842
No, dear. Wrong again. He's in 128.
But he's gone all day.

01:39:30.009 --> 01:39:31.510
You can't see him today.

01:39:31.678 --> 01:39:35.389
You wanna come back to my office
and we can schedule an appointment?

01:39:35.557 --> 01:39:37.683
You know what?
I'll come back another time...

01:39:37.851 --> 01:39:40.602
...when he's got time to talk,
when things kind of die down.

01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:43.313
- I appreciate it. Thank you.
- You can call me any time.

01:39:43.481 --> 01:39:45.315
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:52.322
Your Honor,
the state calls Deputy Dwayne Looney.

01:40:28.276 --> 01:40:29.776
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:40:29.944 --> 01:40:32.905
Would you please state
your name for the record?

01:40:33.072 --> 01:40:36.283
Deputy Dwayne Powell Looney.

01:40:36.451 --> 01:40:38.243
Thank you, Deputy Looney.

01:40:38.411 --> 01:40:41.038
You were present at the murders
of Billy Ray Cobb...

01:40:41.206 --> 01:40:43.457
...and James Lewis Willard,
were you not?

01:40:43.625 --> 01:40:45.209
Yes, sir. I was.

01:40:45.376 --> 01:40:47.252
If you can remember...

01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:51.632
...describe how you were wounded
for the members of the jury.

01:40:51.799 --> 01:40:55.302
I think bullets bounced off the floor,
caught me in the knee.

01:40:55.470 --> 01:40:57.387
And what happened to your leg?

01:40:58.765 --> 01:41:00.057
Doc cut it off.

01:41:01.392 --> 01:41:06.438
And after the loss of your right leg,
Detective Looney...

01:41:07.398 --> 01:41:09.775
...are you still able
to serve as a police officer?

01:41:11.694 --> 01:41:14.029
I'm able to perform....

01:41:17.659 --> 01:41:21.161
I'm able to perform a number of services.

01:41:21.329 --> 01:41:23.956
Did you get a good look at the man
with the gun?

01:41:24.123 --> 01:41:25.165
No, sir.

01:41:26.167 --> 01:41:31.338
However, Mr. Hailey did personally
apologize for his shooting me.

01:41:33.466 --> 01:41:34.883
Oh.

01:41:36.636 --> 01:41:39.805
So Mr. Hailey admitted shooting you.

01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:41.431
Yes, sir.

01:41:41.599 --> 01:41:43.475
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

01:41:43.643 --> 01:41:45.560
- Mr. Brigance.
- No questions, Your Honor.

01:41:45.728 --> 01:41:47.187
Wait a minute.

01:41:47.355 --> 01:41:49.856
- Uh, Mr. Buckley?
- Yes, Your Honor.

01:41:50.024 --> 01:41:51.400
The state would like to call--

01:41:51.567 --> 01:41:53.527
Give me a moment
to speak with my client.

01:41:53.695 --> 01:41:54.861
Take your time.

01:41:56.823 --> 01:41:59.074
Ask him if he thinks I ought to go to jail.

01:41:59.367 --> 01:42:02.327
Carl Lee, they amputated his leg
because you shot him.

01:42:02.495 --> 01:42:04.288
He's a witness for the prosecution.

01:42:04.455 --> 01:42:06.540
- You're my lawyer, ain't you?
- Yeah.

01:42:07.083 --> 01:42:08.959
Ask him.

01:42:15.258 --> 01:42:19.386
- Your Honor, one question.
- Make up your mind, Mr. Brigance.

01:42:23.641 --> 01:42:24.683
Deputy Looney.

01:42:26.269 --> 01:42:29.396
Do you think Carl Lee
shooting you was intentional?

01:42:29.564 --> 01:42:30.981
No, sir.

01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:32.482
It was an accident.

01:42:36.904 --> 01:42:37.946
Ask him.

01:42:45.038 --> 01:42:47.998
Do you think he should be punished
for shooting you?

01:42:48.791 --> 01:42:50.542
No, sir.

01:42:50.710 --> 01:42:54.338
I hold no ill will toward the man.

01:42:54.756 --> 01:42:56.590
He did what I would've done.

01:42:56.758 --> 01:42:58.675
What do you mean by that,
Deputy Looney?

01:42:58.843 --> 01:43:01.303
I mean I don't blame him
for what he did.

01:43:01.471 --> 01:43:03.305
Those boys raped his little girl.

01:43:03.473 --> 01:43:07.976
Objection, Your Honor. The witness's
opinion on this matter is irrelevant.

01:43:08.144 --> 01:43:13.857
Your Honor, I believe Deputy Looney
has earned the right to speak here today.

01:43:15.401 --> 01:43:16.568
Overruled.

01:43:17.779 --> 01:43:19.404
Continue.

01:43:22.158 --> 01:43:23.367
Go ahead, Dwayne.

01:43:24.577 --> 01:43:26.828
I got a little girl.

01:43:28.706 --> 01:43:31.375
Somebody rapes her, he's a dead dog.

01:43:31.542 --> 01:43:33.752
I'll blow him away just like Carl Lee did.

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:35.128
Objection, Your Honor!

01:43:35.296 --> 01:43:37.464
Do you think the jury
should convict Carl Lee?

01:43:37.632 --> 01:43:39.925
Don't answer that question, deputy.

01:43:40.093 --> 01:43:42.219
He's a hero. You turn him loose.

01:43:42.387 --> 01:43:44.471
Jury will disregard.

01:43:44.639 --> 01:43:45.889
Turn him loose!

01:43:46.307 --> 01:43:48.558
Your Honor, you silence that witness!

01:43:48.726 --> 01:43:50.727
Turn him loose!

01:43:55.149 --> 01:43:56.274
No!

01:43:58.152 --> 01:44:01.363
People say whatever the hell
they want in this courtroom!

01:44:01.697 --> 01:44:03.240
Quiet!

01:44:05.952 --> 01:44:08.328
Any more of that nonsense...

01:44:08.496 --> 01:44:10.122
...and you're all out of here.

01:44:12.417 --> 01:44:15.252
Now, Mr. Buckley, you may begin.

01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:17.462
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:44:18.089 --> 01:44:22.717
Would you please state your name and
occupation for the members of the jury.

01:44:22.885 --> 01:44:27.139
My name is Dr. Wilbert Rodeheaver,
chair of Psychiatry...

01:44:27.306 --> 01:44:29.015
...at Mississippi State University...

01:44:29.183 --> 01:44:33.311
...and clinical director of the Whitfield
Facility for the Criminally Insane.

01:44:34.647 --> 01:44:37.566
Thank you, doctor.
Your credentials speak for themselves.

01:44:37.733 --> 01:44:42.028
Now, doctor, can you please explain,
as you do so eloquently in your book...

01:44:42.196 --> 01:44:44.364
...the McNaughton Rule for the jury?

01:44:44.532 --> 01:44:45.615
Certainly.

01:44:45.783 --> 01:44:47.159
The McNaughton Rule states...

01:44:47.326 --> 01:44:51.496
...that a person must be
unable to tell right from wrong...

01:44:51.664 --> 01:44:55.876
...and/or be unaware
of the consequences of his actions...

01:44:56.043 --> 01:44:58.253
...to be termed legally insane.

01:44:58.421 --> 01:45:00.338
Now, did you examine Mr. Hailey?

01:45:00.506 --> 01:45:04.134
Yes. Mr. Hailey and I spoke
about his childhood, his family...

01:45:04.302 --> 01:45:06.720
...his experiences during the war.

01:45:06.888 --> 01:45:08.638
And the rape of his daughter?

01:45:08.806 --> 01:45:14.102
Yes, we spoke at length
about the brutal rape of his daughter Tonya.

01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:17.856
What is your diagnosis
of Mr. Hailey's mental condition...

01:45:18.024 --> 01:45:22.694
...on the day that he shot
Billy Ray Cobb and James Lewis Willard?

01:45:22.862 --> 01:45:25.197
At the time of the murders,
his mental condition...

01:45:25.364 --> 01:45:27.574
...was without any defects of any nature.

01:45:27.742 --> 01:45:29.576
Mr. Hailey was sane.

01:45:29.744 --> 01:45:32.162
But wait a minute, doctor.
The defense contends--

01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:35.415
Why, Mr. Brigance has gone to great effort
to prove to this jury...

01:45:35.583 --> 01:45:38.877
...that Mr. Hailey is a nutball.

01:45:39.086 --> 01:45:41.087
Is a slow coach.

01:45:41.255 --> 01:45:44.716
Or what's the clinical definition?

01:45:44.884 --> 01:45:46.426
Insane.

01:45:48.346 --> 01:45:50.597
- Do you disagree?
- Yes.

01:45:50.765 --> 01:45:53.642
Carl Lee Hailey knew very well
what he was doing.

01:45:53.809 --> 01:45:56.311
He slaughtered those men in cold blood.

01:45:57.355 --> 01:45:58.438
Thank you, doctor.

01:45:58.606 --> 01:46:01.650
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

01:46:02.610 --> 01:46:06.071
- Buddy, where the hell is Roark?
- I got no clue.

01:46:06.239 --> 01:46:08.490
Cross-examination, Mr. Brigance?

01:46:09.617 --> 01:46:13.537
Your Honor,
we would request a recess until--

01:46:15.831 --> 01:46:18.917
No, we will not need a recess,
Your Honor, but just a few moments.

01:46:25.508 --> 01:46:27.092
Mr. Brigance?

01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:30.470
When you and Lois Lane are ready....

01:46:33.808 --> 01:46:36.184
Just a few questions, Your Honor.

01:46:39.021 --> 01:46:40.689
Doctor, who do you work for?

01:46:40.856 --> 01:46:42.482
State of Mississippi.

01:46:42.650 --> 01:46:43.858
In your 11 years...

01:46:44.026 --> 01:46:47.654
...how many times have you testified
where the insanity defense was used?

01:46:47.822 --> 01:46:49.990
This is my 46th trial.

01:46:50.157 --> 01:46:51.825
Forty-sixth trial.

01:46:51.993 --> 01:46:53.243
Well, of those 46 trials...

01:46:53.411 --> 01:46:57.497
...how many times have you testified
that the defendant was legally insane?

01:46:57.665 --> 01:47:00.292
Objection, Your Honor!
The good doctor cannot be asked...

01:47:00.459 --> 01:47:04.629
...to recall all of his testimony
at these previous trials. It's absurd.

01:47:04.797 --> 01:47:06.089
Overruled.

01:47:07.091 --> 01:47:09.009
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:47:09.552 --> 01:47:11.011
I can't remember.

01:47:11.178 --> 01:47:13.722
Could it be, doctor, the reason
you can't remember...

01:47:13.889 --> 01:47:16.891
...is that in 11 years and 46 trials...

01:47:17.059 --> 01:47:20.270
...you never have seen a defendant
whom you have found insane?

01:47:20.605 --> 01:47:22.731
I can't recall at this time.

01:47:24.191 --> 01:47:26.735
Can you recall testifying
at the trial of one Dan Baker?

01:47:26.902 --> 01:47:30.238
Objection! Your Honor, this has nothing
to do with the proceedings here.

01:47:30.406 --> 01:47:31.823
Overruled.

01:47:31.991 --> 01:47:36.077
- This.... This better be good, Mr. Brigance.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

01:47:36.871 --> 01:47:41.333
I'll ask again. Can you recall
testifying the trial of one Dan Baker?

01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:46.338
It's a rather brutal double homicide where
you found the defendant legally sane?

01:47:47.089 --> 01:47:48.340
Yes.

01:47:48.507 --> 01:47:51.092
A dissenting psychiatrist
disagreed with you, doctor.

01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:54.763
And Mr. Baker was found insane
and institutionalized.

01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:56.556
Where is he currently, doctor?

01:47:56.724 --> 01:47:57.766
At Whitfield.

01:47:57.933 --> 01:48:00.060
Who is the chief psychiatrist
at Whitfield?

01:48:00.227 --> 01:48:02.646
- I am.
- You are.

01:48:03.898 --> 01:48:06.733
Dr. Rodeheaver is the chief psychiatrist
at Whitfield.

01:48:07.276 --> 01:48:10.070
Now, help me make this clear
to the jury, doctor.

01:48:10.237 --> 01:48:15.367
In 1985, you testified that Dan Baker
was legally sane.

01:48:15.534 --> 01:48:17.619
The jury disagreed with you.

01:48:17.787 --> 01:48:21.206
And Mr. Baker was found not guilty
by reason of insanity.

01:48:21.374 --> 01:48:24.834
Since that time, he has been a patient
in your hospital, under your care...

01:48:25.002 --> 01:48:27.587
...as a paranoid schizophrenic.
Is that correct, doctor?

01:48:27.755 --> 01:48:28.838
Yes.

01:48:29.006 --> 01:48:30.799
Do you normally admit patients...

01:48:30.966 --> 01:48:34.427
...keep and treat them for 10 years
if they're of sound mind and body?

01:48:34.595 --> 01:48:35.929
Of course not.

01:48:36.097 --> 01:48:38.473
Then it would be fair to say...

01:48:38.641 --> 01:48:42.102
...that you find insane people sane
for the purposes of trial?

01:48:42.269 --> 01:48:45.313
Objection, Your Honor!
This is argumentative!

01:48:45.481 --> 01:48:49.901
Withdraw the question, Your Honor.
No further questions.

01:48:54.407 --> 01:48:55.782
Genius, Roark.

01:49:10.715 --> 01:49:15.093
- Mr. Brigance! Mr. Brigance!
- Yes. Yes.

01:49:15.261 --> 01:49:18.012
How do you expect
to get a fair trial in Mississippi?

01:49:21.559 --> 01:49:23.309
Get him!

01:49:24.353 --> 01:49:27.272
- Get an ambulance, get, get!
- Come on.

01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:42.162
So is there any news
on the guard who was shot?

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:45.248
Ozzie says he's probably paralyzed.

01:49:49.670 --> 01:49:51.546
Some stranger...

01:49:51.714 --> 01:49:54.048
...somebody's husband...

01:49:54.341 --> 01:49:56.509
...somebody's son...

01:49:57.011 --> 01:49:59.763
...put himself in harm's way...

01:50:01.515 --> 01:50:03.224
...for me.

01:50:04.268 --> 01:50:06.770
When I saw the blood...

01:50:07.396 --> 01:50:10.190
...I got so scared
because I thought that was you.

01:50:19.366 --> 01:50:20.992
Do you want me to stay?

01:50:24.371 --> 01:50:25.955
Yeah.

01:50:26.874 --> 01:50:29.042
I want you to stay.

01:50:33.464 --> 01:50:35.715
So you better go.

01:50:39.303 --> 01:50:41.179
Okay.

01:51:01.242 --> 01:51:03.117
Oh, shit.

01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:12.919
Speed limit's 45, not 70, ma'am.

01:51:13.087 --> 01:51:15.755
- Haven't been drinking, have you?
- I guess I just wasn't--

01:51:15.923 --> 01:51:17.799
Let me ask you
to get out of the car.

01:51:17.967 --> 01:51:21.135
- Is that really necessary?
- Just get out of the car.

01:51:21.762 --> 01:51:25.181
Isnât it usually customary to ask
for a license and registration?

01:51:26.559 --> 01:51:28.768
- You bitch.
- No!

01:51:29.019 --> 01:51:31.104
Get her in the car.

01:51:33.524 --> 01:51:36.109
- No! No!
- Come on.

01:51:36.277 --> 01:51:38.027
Get in there.

01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:41.656
Shut up!

01:52:38.505 --> 01:52:41.424
You can't blame a nigger
for being a nigger...

01:52:41.592 --> 01:52:45.011
...no more than you can blame
a dog for being a dog.

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:49.265
But a whore like you...

01:52:49.892 --> 01:52:52.894
...co-mingling with mongrels,
betraying your own...

01:52:53.062 --> 01:52:55.521
...that makes you worse
than being a nigger.

01:52:55.689 --> 01:52:57.982
So I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

01:52:58.692 --> 01:53:01.110
I'm gonna leave you tied up here naked.

01:53:02.071 --> 01:53:04.656
First it'll just be the bugs eating at you.

01:53:04.823 --> 01:53:06.532
One day, maybe two.

01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:09.118
That sun's gonna be cooking you.

01:53:09.370 --> 01:53:11.329
But them animals?

01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:15.375
They're gonna pick up your stink.

01:53:18.087 --> 01:53:20.713
They're gonna come looking
for something to eat.

01:53:21.757 --> 01:53:25.343
Carl Lee Hailey should've shot you too.

01:53:31.517 --> 01:53:33.768
Come on, boys. Let's go.

01:54:08.512 --> 01:54:11.097
No. No. No.

01:54:11.265 --> 01:54:13.558
No. No.

01:54:21.483 --> 01:54:23.568
Shh. It's okay.

01:54:31.326 --> 01:54:32.410
It's okay.

01:54:32.578 --> 01:54:34.120
It's okay now.

01:54:34.288 --> 01:54:36.122
It's okay.

01:54:39.543 --> 01:54:42.879
Mr. Brigance,
you may call your first witness.

01:54:43.047 --> 01:54:47.759
Yes, Your Honor.
Defense calls Dr. Willard Tyrell Bass.

01:54:52.473 --> 01:54:54.932
- Buddy, have you seen Roark?
- Not yet.

01:54:59.730 --> 01:55:02.398
Doctor, would you explain to the jury...

01:55:02.566 --> 01:55:06.360
...the effect his daughter's rape
had on Mr. Hailey's condition?

01:55:06.779 --> 01:55:08.905
Tonya's rape caused a relapse...

01:55:09.073 --> 01:55:11.240
...a temporary break with reality.

01:55:11.909 --> 01:55:14.952
But yesterday, a Dr. Rodeheaver...

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:18.164
...suggested that Mr. Hailey's
act of calculation was...

01:55:18.332 --> 01:55:20.083
...the very definition of sanity.

01:55:20.250 --> 01:55:22.335
That's ridiculous.

01:55:22.503 --> 01:55:26.339
Many of the most famous
schizophrenics are calculating.

01:55:26.507 --> 01:55:28.341
John Hinckley, for example.

01:55:28.509 --> 01:55:29.550
Calculating.

01:55:29.718 --> 01:55:31.219
And legally insane.

01:55:31.553 --> 01:55:34.388
All right, so, Dr. Bass,
how would you diagnose Mr. Hailey...

01:55:34.556 --> 01:55:35.890
...at the time of the murder?

01:55:36.058 --> 01:55:40.353
Mr. Hailey experienced a recurrence
of a dissociative condition...

01:55:40.521 --> 01:55:44.398
...as a result of the trauma
caused by the rape of his daughter.

01:55:44.817 --> 01:55:48.361
Now, since Mr. Hailey was unaware
of the reality of his actions...

01:55:48.529 --> 01:55:50.905
...he could not tell right from wrong.

01:55:51.073 --> 01:55:54.408
Nor could he understand
the consequences of his actions.

01:55:54.576 --> 01:55:57.787
He was, therefore, legally insane.

01:55:59.373 --> 01:56:00.957
Could not tell right from wrong...

01:56:01.125 --> 01:56:04.001
...nor understand the consequences
of his actions.

01:56:04.545 --> 01:56:07.505
Therefore, legally, insane.

01:56:08.173 --> 01:56:12.051
Thank you, Dr. Bass.
Your Honor, I have no further questions.

01:56:12.636 --> 01:56:13.803
Mr. Buckley?

01:56:15.597 --> 01:56:17.849
- Mr. Buckley.
- Yes?

01:56:18.475 --> 01:56:19.725
Your witness.

01:56:20.686 --> 01:56:23.521
Oh. I'm sorry, excuse me.
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:56:25.232 --> 01:56:27.650
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:56:27.818 --> 01:56:32.572
Dr. Bass, could you please
state for the record your full name?

01:56:32.739 --> 01:56:35.074
Willard Tyrell Bass.

01:56:35.242 --> 01:56:38.452
Tyrell Bass. That's a very unique name.

01:56:39.079 --> 01:56:44.000
Now, doctor,
have you ever been convicted of a felony?

01:56:44.168 --> 01:56:45.459
No, of course not.

01:56:45.627 --> 01:56:47.795
- You're certain?
- Yes.

01:56:47.963 --> 01:56:52.592
As certain of that as you are of the
testimony you've just given before this jury?

01:56:52.759 --> 01:56:53.759
Of course.

01:56:53.927 --> 01:56:56.345
So let me understand this now...

01:56:56.513 --> 01:56:58.890
...since you are under oath.

01:56:59.433 --> 01:57:03.978
You're telling me, and this jury,
that on October 17th, 1960...

01:57:04.146 --> 01:57:06.480
...you were not
convicted of statutory rape?

01:57:06.648 --> 01:57:07.982
Objection, Your Honor!

01:57:10.027 --> 01:57:11.444
Dr. Bass is not on trial here.

01:57:11.612 --> 01:57:14.322
This goes to the heart
of the credibility of the witness.

01:57:14.489 --> 01:57:17.950
- Overruled. Continue, Mr. Buckley.
- Thank you.

01:57:18.118 --> 01:57:20.077
Now, doctor...

01:57:21.288 --> 01:57:23.414
...were you convicted of statutory rape?

01:57:23.957 --> 01:57:25.708
You got the wrong man.

01:57:25.876 --> 01:57:27.084
Really?

01:57:27.252 --> 01:57:29.629
I have some mighty interesting
photographs of you...

01:57:29.796 --> 01:57:32.215
...taken with a female underage...

01:57:32.382 --> 01:57:36.469
...in a motel by the Dallas Police Department
on September 11th, 1960.

01:57:36.637 --> 01:57:41.599
Would you like to look at these images
and see if they refresh your memory?

01:57:44.269 --> 01:57:45.603
No, I didn't think so.

01:57:45.771 --> 01:57:49.565
Your Honor, we would like to enter into
evidence these court and police records...

01:57:49.733 --> 01:57:55.529
...showing that on September 15th, 1960,
this man, one Tyrell Bass...

01:57:55.697 --> 01:57:59.242
...pled guilty to statutory rape.

01:57:59.409 --> 01:58:02.036
Now, doctor,
I'm gonna ask you one last time...

01:58:02.204 --> 01:58:06.916
...were you or were you not
convicted of statutory rape?

01:58:07.542 --> 01:58:10.544
- Well, I can explain--
- Not interested in your explanation.

01:58:10.712 --> 01:58:12.421
Answer the question, yes or no.

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:16.175
Yes. Yes, I was.

01:58:22.474 --> 01:58:24.058
That's enough.

01:58:24.226 --> 01:58:26.519
I have nothing further.

01:58:30.315 --> 01:58:32.358
Redirect, Mr. Brigance?

01:58:34.778 --> 01:58:35.861
None, Your Honor.

01:58:36.029 --> 01:58:38.906
Court will recess one hour for lunch.

01:58:39.199 --> 01:58:41.701
You told me you knew him,
he was a credible witness.

01:58:41.868 --> 01:58:43.869
I didn't know. The record was expunged.

01:58:44.037 --> 01:58:46.163
Buckley really outdid himself this time.

01:58:46.331 --> 01:58:48.916
Damn. Lucien, I was counting on you.

01:58:49.084 --> 01:58:51.168
- And I can't win--
- You wanted this case.

01:58:51.336 --> 01:58:52.378
Well, you got it.

01:58:52.546 --> 01:58:56.215
It isn't easy saving the world
one case at a time, but you stick with it.

01:58:56.383 --> 01:58:59.593
You might just have a knack for it.
Don't do what I did. Don't quit.

01:58:59.761 --> 01:59:01.595
What are you talking about, quit?

01:59:01.763 --> 01:59:04.432
- You're a hero, Lucien.
- Oh, hero, my ass.

01:59:04.599 --> 01:59:08.060
Do you think the world needed me
beating cops' heads on that picket line?

01:59:08.228 --> 01:59:12.148
I was needed here, in that courtroom.

01:59:12.482 --> 01:59:13.566
And I let them push me.

01:59:13.734 --> 01:59:15.943
I gave them an excuse to kick me out...

01:59:16.111 --> 01:59:18.946
...and now I can never
plead a case in there again.

01:59:19.114 --> 01:59:20.573
But you can.

01:59:20.741 --> 01:59:22.074
You're an attorney.

01:59:22.242 --> 01:59:23.576
Be proud.

01:59:23.744 --> 01:59:27.872
Your job is to find justice, no matter
how well she may hide herself from you.

01:59:29.374 --> 01:59:31.334
So you go on in there...

01:59:31.501 --> 01:59:32.918
...and you do your job.

01:59:34.421 --> 01:59:35.880
Hurry up, now.

01:59:36.048 --> 01:59:38.341
They'll be starting without you.

01:59:42.929 --> 01:59:44.096
Come with me.

01:59:45.932 --> 01:59:47.224
I can't, Jake.

01:59:49.061 --> 01:59:50.770
I love you...

01:59:50.937 --> 01:59:52.063
...but I can't.

01:59:52.606 --> 01:59:53.647
You know that.

01:59:53.815 --> 01:59:56.817
I'll never go in another courtroom again.

01:59:57.527 --> 01:59:58.986
And I can't be you, Lucien.

02:00:00.238 --> 02:00:02.448
Don't be me.

02:00:02.616 --> 02:00:04.950
Be better than me.

02:00:07.245 --> 02:00:10.706
All rise
for the Honorable Judge Omar Noose.

02:00:20.592 --> 02:00:22.843
And how did you feel?

02:00:23.512 --> 02:00:25.888
I felt, um....

02:00:28.517 --> 02:00:30.601
I don't know.

02:00:32.187 --> 02:00:34.772
It was like I was outside myself...

02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:37.233
...watching myself.

02:00:38.193 --> 02:00:42.279
All the while I kept hearing my baby say:

02:00:42.781 --> 02:00:45.324
"I called for you, Daddy.

02:00:45.492 --> 02:00:51.997
When them men was hurting me,
I called for you over and over...

02:00:52.165 --> 02:00:54.500
...but you didn't never come."

02:01:00.674 --> 02:01:02.675
Thank you, Mr. Hailey.

02:01:03.468 --> 02:01:06.178
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

02:01:07.681 --> 02:01:09.223
You have an emergency phone call.

02:01:09.391 --> 02:01:10.433
Mr. Buckley.

02:01:18.817 --> 02:01:20.693
Mr. Hailey...

02:01:21.862 --> 02:01:26.699
...before you stepped outside yourself
to watch yourself shoot Willard and Cobb...

02:01:26.867 --> 02:01:31.370
...were you aware that if convicted
they might be freed in only 10 years?

02:01:31.538 --> 02:01:33.497
Yes, I heard people say that. Yes, sir.

02:01:33.665 --> 02:01:36.625
Do you think men who kidnap
a child should be free in 10 years?

02:01:36.793 --> 02:01:40.171
- No.
- Think men who rape a child should be free?

02:01:40.338 --> 02:01:41.380
No, sir.

02:01:41.548 --> 02:01:44.550
Do you think two men who hang a child
should be free in 10 years?

02:01:44.718 --> 02:01:47.011
- No.
- What should happen? What would be fair?

02:01:47.179 --> 02:01:49.638
- Objection.
- Do you think they deserve to die?

02:01:49.806 --> 02:01:52.224
- Now, Mr. Buckley--
- Carl Lee don't answer that!

02:01:52.392 --> 02:01:55.352
Yes, they deserved to die
and I hope they burn in hell!

02:02:11.578 --> 02:02:14.330
I have nothing further, Your Honor.

02:02:17.959 --> 02:02:20.794
Summations begin tomorrow.

02:02:22.506 --> 02:02:24.215
Court adjourned.

02:02:31.097 --> 02:02:34.141
Jake, they found Roark.

02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:57.456
- Ellen....
- Hmm.

02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:05.381
Ellen.

02:03:06.967 --> 02:03:08.884
So...

02:03:10.011 --> 02:03:12.680
...this is what I had to do
to get you to call me "Ellen"?

02:03:15.308 --> 02:03:16.517
I'm so sorry.

02:03:16.685 --> 02:03:18.477
This is all my fault.

02:03:18.645 --> 02:03:19.979
No.

02:03:20.146 --> 02:03:22.773
Don't sweat it, really.

02:03:23.775 --> 02:03:26.527
They didn't--
They didn't hurt anything that won't heal.

02:03:26.695 --> 02:03:28.362
Nothing.

02:03:29.823 --> 02:03:32.950
Besides, um, Dr., uh...

02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:36.954
...What's-His-Name
said I'll be out in a couple days...

02:03:37.122 --> 02:03:38.247
...so I'm fine.

02:03:42.335 --> 02:03:43.627
How'd we do?

02:03:45.547 --> 02:03:48.465
Bass turned out to be a felon.

02:03:49.259 --> 02:03:52.970
Carl Lee got trapped on the stand
by Buckley.

02:03:55.849 --> 02:03:58.601
People been terrorized, Roark.

02:03:58.768 --> 02:04:00.519
Beaten.

02:04:02.439 --> 02:04:04.815
Killed. It--

02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:07.151
It's not worth it. It's not.

02:04:09.738 --> 02:04:13.407
It's only not worth it
if Carl Lee goes to the gas chamber.

02:04:16.953 --> 02:04:20.080
Listen, this case is not over
until the summation.

02:04:20.248 --> 02:04:22.291
Remember that.

02:04:22.667 --> 02:04:24.209
Okay?

02:04:25.503 --> 02:04:29.381
And you've got one big fat chance...

02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:31.467
...to reinvent yourself.

02:04:32.344 --> 02:04:37.640
To make that jury see this whole case--
This whole case through your eyes.

02:04:44.397 --> 02:04:45.773
And they're good eyes.

02:04:51.237 --> 02:04:53.530
Now, get out of here, go to work.

02:04:55.659 --> 02:04:57.117
I'll keep in touch with you.

02:04:57.535 --> 02:04:58.869
No, you won't.

02:04:59.037 --> 02:05:00.579
Big liar.

02:05:10.465 --> 02:05:12.925
Win or lose, Roark...

02:05:14.302 --> 02:05:16.178
...we make one hell of a team.

02:05:17.555 --> 02:05:19.682
We might have.

02:05:20.767 --> 02:05:22.726
We really might have.

02:05:27.023 --> 02:05:29.900
You really want to kiss me right now,
don't you?

02:05:31.486 --> 02:05:33.612
Yes, I do.

02:05:55.468 --> 02:05:56.593
Undecided?

02:05:59.222 --> 02:06:00.848
Guilty?

02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:42.014
Hey, Max. Hey.

02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:50.314
Where's Hannah?

02:06:50.482 --> 02:06:53.108
I left her at Mother and Daddy's.

02:06:54.736 --> 02:06:55.903
How did you get here?

02:06:56.529 --> 02:06:57.905
Drove.

02:06:58.531 --> 02:07:00.032
In the storm?

02:07:02.368 --> 02:07:05.704
Got something to say,
it needs to be said in person.

02:07:10.418 --> 02:07:14.004
The truth is, I've been blaming you
for all that's happened.

02:07:16.925 --> 02:07:19.843
But it's not your fault.
You didn't kill those boys.

02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:27.351
You were trying to make things right.

02:07:29.521 --> 02:07:31.563
I know that now.

02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:40.113
I thought you took this case
because you wanted to prove...

02:07:40.281 --> 02:07:42.908
...what a bigtime lawyer you were.

02:07:43.701 --> 02:07:45.786
But I was wrong.

02:07:49.415 --> 02:07:52.251
You took this case because...

02:07:52.418 --> 02:07:54.628
...if those boys...

02:07:57.006 --> 02:08:01.802
...had hurt Hannah
the way that they hurt Tonya...

02:08:01.970 --> 02:08:03.887
...you would've killed them yourself.

02:08:06.933 --> 02:08:08.642
Baby.

02:08:11.062 --> 02:08:13.856
Baby, come here.

02:08:14.023 --> 02:08:15.858
Come here.

02:08:18.319 --> 02:08:20.654
I love you, Jake.

02:08:22.073 --> 02:08:24.449
I thought I was gonna lose you.

02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:51.810
We're gonna lose this case, Carl Lee.

02:08:54.355 --> 02:08:58.483
There are no points of law to argue here.
I wanna cop a plea.

02:09:00.486 --> 02:09:02.404
Maybe Buckley will cop us...

02:09:02.572 --> 02:09:05.949
...a second-degree murder
and we can get you just life in prison.

02:09:07.785 --> 02:09:11.496
Jake, I-- I can't do no life in prison.

02:09:11.664 --> 02:09:14.082
You gotta get me off.
Man, if it was you on trial--

02:09:14.250 --> 02:09:15.918
It's not me.

02:09:16.836 --> 02:09:18.211
We're not the same, Carl Lee.

02:09:21.132 --> 02:09:24.384
The jury has to identify
with the defendant.

02:09:24.552 --> 02:09:26.303
They see you, they see a yard worker.

02:09:26.471 --> 02:09:30.474
They see me, they see an attorney.
I live in town. You live on the hill.

02:09:30.642 --> 02:09:33.685
Oh, you white and I'm black.

02:09:36.147 --> 02:09:37.856
See, Jake?

02:09:38.232 --> 02:09:40.442
You think just like them.

02:09:41.527 --> 02:09:43.904
That's why I picked you.

02:09:44.906 --> 02:09:47.574
You're one of them, don't you see?

02:09:47.742 --> 02:09:50.077
You think you ain't,
because you eat in Claude's...

02:09:50.244 --> 02:09:54.957
...and you're out there trying to get me off
on TV, talking about black and white.

02:09:55.124 --> 02:09:57.084
But the fact is...

02:09:57.251 --> 02:09:59.962
...you're just like all the rest of them.

02:10:00.129 --> 02:10:03.090
When you look at me,
you don't see a man.

02:10:03.257 --> 02:10:05.175
You see a black man.

02:10:06.010 --> 02:10:09.429
Carl Lee, I am your friend.

02:10:09.597 --> 02:10:11.348
We ain't no friends, Jake.

02:10:12.642 --> 02:10:15.644
We're on different sides of the line.

02:10:15.812 --> 02:10:20.232
I ain't never seen you in my part of town.
I bet you don't even know where I live.

02:10:22.026 --> 02:10:25.070
Our daughters, Jake,
they ain't never gonna play together.

02:10:25.238 --> 02:10:27.614
Now, what are you talking about?

02:10:29.867 --> 02:10:33.078
America is a war...

02:10:33.246 --> 02:10:35.539
...and you are on the other side.

02:10:37.291 --> 02:10:40.127
How a black man
ever gonna get a fair trial...

02:10:40.294 --> 02:10:43.296
...with the enemy on the bench
and the jury box?

02:10:43.464 --> 02:10:46.925
My life in white hands.

02:10:47.176 --> 02:10:48.260
You, Jake.

02:10:48.970 --> 02:10:50.887
That's how.

02:10:51.055 --> 02:10:55.267
You my secret weapon
because you're one of the bad guys.

02:10:55.435 --> 02:10:58.311
You don't mean to be, but you are.

02:10:58.479 --> 02:11:00.772
It's how you was raised.

02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:05.277
Nigger, Negro, black, African-American.

02:11:05.445 --> 02:11:07.571
No matter how you see me...

02:11:07.739 --> 02:11:10.449
...you see me as different.

02:11:10.616 --> 02:11:13.952
You see me like that jury sees me.

02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:15.912
You are them.

02:11:16.706 --> 02:11:19.708
Now, throw out your points of law, Jake.

02:11:20.543 --> 02:11:24.796
If you was on that jury...

02:11:24.964 --> 02:11:29.593
...what would it take
to convince you to set me free?

02:11:32.013 --> 02:11:34.973
That's how you'll save my ass.

02:11:35.558 --> 02:11:37.726
That's how you'll save us both.

02:11:42.273 --> 02:11:46.777
Is Carl Lee Hailey insane?

02:11:47.653 --> 02:11:50.072
It's a notion so outrageous...

02:11:50.239 --> 02:11:54.576
...the only witness
the defense could produce to support it...

02:11:54.744 --> 02:11:56.745
...was a convicted felon.

02:11:57.497 --> 02:12:00.123
No. Carl Lee Hailey is not insane.

02:12:00.291 --> 02:12:03.543
This is a man
who is a confessed murderer.

02:12:04.796 --> 02:12:09.633
This is a man who admitted
on this stand...

02:12:09.801 --> 02:12:13.011
...to carrying out the sentences
he believed the alleged rapists...

02:12:13.179 --> 02:12:15.180
...of his daughter deserved.

02:12:15.348 --> 02:12:17.682
He's taken justice out of your hands.

02:12:20.436 --> 02:12:21.770
And put it in his own.

02:12:22.605 --> 02:12:27.275
And with those hands,
he took the lives of two young men.

02:12:30.363 --> 02:12:33.490
We feel terrible
over what happened to his daughter.

02:12:33.991 --> 02:12:35.742
But feeling terrible...

02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:40.288
...and knowing something is wrong
does not give any of us...

02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:42.415
...a right to kill.

02:12:44.043 --> 02:12:46.253
Ladies and gentlemen, your duty is clear.

02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:52.050
All in this courtroom know the truth.

02:12:52.468 --> 02:12:55.512
All in this state know the truth.

02:12:56.430 --> 02:13:01.351
Now you need only find the courage
to speak the words:

02:13:01.727 --> 02:13:05.397
"Carl Lee Hailey is guilty."

02:13:06.399 --> 02:13:09.109
Guilty. Guilty.

02:13:11.404 --> 02:13:13.780
State rests, Your Honor.

02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:33.383
Now, I had a great summation
all worked out...

02:13:33.593 --> 02:13:36.136
...full of some sharp lawyering.

02:13:37.388 --> 02:13:38.722
But I'm not going to read it.

02:13:40.141 --> 02:13:41.808
I'm here to apologize.

02:13:41.976 --> 02:13:45.437
I am young, and I am inexperienced.

02:13:46.063 --> 02:13:51.026
But you cannot
hold Carl Lee Hailey responsible...

02:13:51.485 --> 02:13:53.028
...for my shortcomings.

02:13:54.238 --> 02:13:56.907
But you see,
in all this legal maneuvering...

02:13:57.074 --> 02:13:59.451
...something has gotten lost.

02:13:59.619 --> 02:14:02.329
And that something is the truth.

02:14:06.125 --> 02:14:10.629
Now, it is incumbent upon us lawyers
not to just talk about the truth...

02:14:10.796 --> 02:14:14.549
...but to actually seek it,
to find it, to live it.

02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:17.761
My teacher taught me that.

02:14:20.181 --> 02:14:22.140
Let's take Dr. Bass, for example.

02:14:22.767 --> 02:14:26.144
Obviously, I would've never knowingly
put a convicted felon on the stand.

02:14:26.312 --> 02:14:27.729
I hope you can believe that.

02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:29.648
But what is the truth?

02:14:29.815 --> 02:14:32.734
That-- That he's a disgraced liar?

02:14:32.902 --> 02:14:34.819
What if I told you...

02:14:34.987 --> 02:14:38.657
...that the woman he was accused
of raping was 17, he was 23...

02:14:38.824 --> 02:14:41.701
...that she later became his wife,
bore his child...

02:14:41.869 --> 02:14:43.495
...and is still married to the man?

02:14:43.663 --> 02:14:47.666
Does that make his testimony
more or less true?

02:14:51.963 --> 02:14:53.755
What is it in us that seeks the truth?

02:14:55.341 --> 02:14:57.259
Is it our minds?

02:14:57.885 --> 02:14:59.386
Or is it our hearts?

02:15:03.266 --> 02:15:06.643
I set out to prove a black man
could receive a fair trial in the South...

02:15:06.811 --> 02:15:09.980
...that we are all equal
in the eyes of the law.

02:15:11.691 --> 02:15:13.275
That's not the truth.

02:15:13.442 --> 02:15:15.694
Because the eyes of the law
are human eyes...

02:15:15.861 --> 02:15:19.823
...yours and mine,
and until we can see each other as equals...

02:15:19.991 --> 02:15:22.325
...justice is never going to be
evenhanded.

02:15:22.493 --> 02:15:26.329
It will remain nothing more than
a reflection of our own prejudices.

02:15:26.622 --> 02:15:29.040
So until that day...

02:15:29.208 --> 02:15:32.460
...we have a duty under God
to seek the truth...

02:15:34.338 --> 02:15:36.464
...not with our eyes,
and not with our minds...

02:15:36.632 --> 02:15:40.218
...where fear and hate turn
commonality into prejudice...

02:15:40.386 --> 02:15:42.595
...but with our hearts...

02:15:42.888 --> 02:15:45.223
...where we don't know better.

02:15:49.562 --> 02:15:51.980
I wanna tell you a story.

02:15:53.733 --> 02:15:56.443
And I ask you all to close your eyes...

02:15:58.070 --> 02:16:00.322
...while I tell you this story.

02:16:03.784 --> 02:16:07.662
I want you to listen to me.
I want you to listen to yourselves.

02:16:11.709 --> 02:16:14.627
Go ahead. Close your eyes, please.

02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:22.594
This is a story about a little girl...

02:16:23.512 --> 02:16:27.265
...walking home from the grocery store
one sunny afternoon.

02:16:28.601 --> 02:16:30.685
I want you to picture this little girl.

02:16:34.106 --> 02:16:36.523
Suddenly, a truck races up.

02:16:38.277 --> 02:16:39.861
Two men jump out and grab her.

02:16:42.490 --> 02:16:45.617
Drag her into a nearby field...

02:16:48.495 --> 02:16:49.870
...and they tie her up.

02:16:53.751 --> 02:16:55.752
And they rip her clothes from her body.

02:16:58.589 --> 02:17:00.882
Now they climb on.

02:17:01.759 --> 02:17:03.968
First one, then the other.

02:17:05.971 --> 02:17:07.055
Raping her.

02:17:12.019 --> 02:17:16.981
Shattering everything innocent and pure
with a vicious thrust...

02:17:17.983 --> 02:17:21.361
...in a fog of drunken breath and sweat.

02:17:25.281 --> 02:17:27.200
And when they're done...

02:17:28.326 --> 02:17:31.413
...after they've killed her tiny womb...

02:17:33.582 --> 02:17:36.876
...murdered any chance
for her to bear children...

02:17:37.044 --> 02:17:39.712
...to have life beyond her own...

02:17:43.174 --> 02:17:45.300
...they decide to use her
for target practice.

02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:51.349
So they start throwing
full beer cans at her.

02:17:53.352 --> 02:17:55.687
They throw them so hard...

02:17:56.355 --> 02:17:59.816
...that it tears the flesh
all the way to her bones.

02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:07.615
Then they urinate on her.

02:18:12.370 --> 02:18:13.745
Now comes the hanging.

02:18:18.919 --> 02:18:20.753
They have a rope.

02:18:22.047 --> 02:18:23.882
They tie a noose.

02:18:25.049 --> 02:18:28.386
Imagine the noose coiling
tight around her neck...

02:18:28.929 --> 02:18:31.556
...and a sudden blinding jerk.

02:18:32.641 --> 02:18:35.518
She's pulled into the air
and her feet and legs go kicking....

02:18:35.686 --> 02:18:37.437
They don't find the ground.

02:18:39.607 --> 02:18:41.483
The hanging branch...

02:18:41.650 --> 02:18:43.610
...isn't strong enough.

02:18:45.279 --> 02:18:47.906
It snaps and she falls...

02:18:48.281 --> 02:18:49.616
...back to the earth.

02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:55.621
So they pick her up...

02:18:56.749 --> 02:18:59.083
...throw her in the back of the truck...

02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:04.088
...drive out to Foggy Creek Bridge...

02:19:04.924 --> 02:19:06.299
...pitch her over the edge.

02:19:09.512 --> 02:19:14.389
And she drops some 30 feet
down to the creek bottom below.

02:19:21.898 --> 02:19:23.775
Can you see her?

02:19:27.571 --> 02:19:29.239
Her raped...

02:19:29.406 --> 02:19:31.156
...beaten...

02:19:31.325 --> 02:19:33.535
...broken body...

02:19:36.621 --> 02:19:38.998
...soaked in their urine...

02:19:39.625 --> 02:19:41.959
...soaked in their semen...

02:19:43.963 --> 02:19:45.797
...soaked in her blood.

02:19:46.799 --> 02:19:48.675
Left to die.

02:19:51.679 --> 02:19:53.555
Can you see her?

02:19:57.560 --> 02:19:59.811
I want you to picture...

02:20:01.605 --> 02:20:03.523
...that little girl.

02:20:22.251 --> 02:20:24.085
Now imagine she's white.

02:20:46.233 --> 02:20:48.026
The defense rests, Your Honor.

02:21:18.390 --> 02:21:19.974
Innocent! He's innocent!

02:21:20.142 --> 02:21:21.726
Innocent! He's innocent!

02:21:21.894 --> 02:21:23.061
Hailey's innocent!

02:21:30.736 --> 02:21:31.861
He's innocent!

02:21:42.373 --> 02:21:44.207
We won! We won!

02:21:44.375 --> 02:21:46.626
Ellen, we won! Aren't you happy?

02:21:46.794 --> 02:21:52.632
Oh, my God, Ellen, you have to be happy.
He's innocent. Carl Lee is innocent.

02:21:54.009 --> 02:21:55.343
He's coming home.

02:21:55.511 --> 02:21:56.803
Jake.

02:21:58.097 --> 02:21:59.931
That was....

02:22:00.641 --> 02:22:02.475
That was....

02:22:03.686 --> 02:22:06.020
Hey, I'm one of the bad guys, remember?

02:22:08.649 --> 02:22:11.943
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

02:22:21.662 --> 02:22:23.913
Freddie Lee Cobb!

02:22:26.625 --> 02:22:29.043
We got something to talk about.

02:22:29.211 --> 02:22:30.753
Hastings...

02:22:30.921 --> 02:22:33.506
...you belong over there with them.

02:22:35.134 --> 02:22:36.968
Get over.

02:22:48.647 --> 02:22:50.523
Congratulations, counselor.

02:22:50.691 --> 02:22:52.316
Thank you.

02:23:13.756 --> 02:23:16.048
You must be overwhelmed right now.

02:23:45.204 --> 02:23:47.288
- Give me--
- After you--

02:23:47.456 --> 02:23:48.831
Yeah.

02:23:51.627 --> 02:23:53.753
- Was I good or what?
- All right.

02:23:53.921 --> 02:23:57.048
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

02:24:04.598 --> 02:24:05.932
Here you go.

02:24:06.099 --> 02:24:09.644
- Carl Lee. Look.
- What?

02:24:33.544 --> 02:24:35.044
Well.

02:24:35.212 --> 02:24:36.254
Hello.

02:24:36.421 --> 02:24:37.505
- Hi.
- Hi there.

02:24:37.673 --> 02:24:39.090
Hannah, this is Miss Hailey.

02:24:39.258 --> 02:24:40.299
- This is Hannah.
- Hi.

02:24:40.467 --> 02:24:43.427
- Hi, Hannah. Ain't she so pretty.
- Thank you.

02:24:43.595 --> 02:24:46.222
- Brought you some peach cobbler.
- Oh, thank you.

02:24:46.390 --> 02:24:48.266
Come on in. Come in.

02:24:50.060 --> 02:24:51.686
Howdy.

02:25:01.446 --> 02:25:03.865
Hannah, this is my daughter, Tonya.

02:25:04.032 --> 02:25:07.201
- Hi, Tonya.
- Hi, nice to meet you, Hannah.

02:25:10.747 --> 02:25:12.832
Just thought our kids
could play together.
