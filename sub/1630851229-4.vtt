00:07.324 --> 00:09.157
What's your beef
with Dr. Sutton?

00:09.159 --> 00:11.159
She's my mother.
She gave birth to me

00:11.161 --> 00:13.587

Hold still.

01:14.909 --> 01:16.391
I'm just wondering

if this might be doing you
more harm than good.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.955
Just something

01:23.400 --> 01:26.418
There had to have been a
medical cause for the accident.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.663
Cops believe she was alone
on the road.

01:29.665 --> 01:31.739
It wasn't dark.

01:31.741 --> 01:34.000
No skid marks.

01:34.002 --> 01:36.929
She could have fallen asleep.

01:36.931 --> 01:40.099
Nah, unlikely.
When she was driving,

01:40.101 --> 01:42.159
she always had a thermos
of coffee with her.

01:42.161 --> 01:44.161
It was her thing.

01:44.163 --> 01:47.164
Maybe she was texting.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.499
She wouldn't do that.

01:49.501 --> 01:52.111
The car could have caused her
to swerve.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.762
Kid on a bike.

01:54.764 --> 01:56.431
Deer. Raccoon. Who knows?

Whenever we went on trips,
she always wanted to drive.

01:59.361 --> 02:01.703
She hated the way I drove.

02:02.865 --> 02:05.198
She was a great driver.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.292
Just doesn't make sense.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.686
I know the answer's
in her medical records.

02:09.688 --> 02:12.205
I know.

02:12.207 --> 02:15.509
I, uh, think I'm gonna take GiGi

laparoscopically.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.832
The intern Devi?

02:50.396 --> 02:52.320
Next question, Dr. Kranepool.

02:52.322 --> 02:55.174
You're taking instruction
from children, for God's sakes.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.567
You can't close on the boss.

02:57.569 --> 02:59.011

03:00.681 --> 03:03.665
-The hell happened?
-Serve the ball, tough guy.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.851
They see your confidence
is gone, it's over.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.854
Yeah, well, my universe is a
little smaller than it once was,

03:08.856 --> 03:10.672

the critical anatomical region

03:40.963 --> 03:42.295
we're looking at, Dr. Devi?

03:42.297 --> 03:45.224
-The hepatocystic triangle.
-Good.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.351
Now, zoom in with the camera.

03:48.470 --> 03:49.478
More.

03:52.066 --> 03:55.692
Until I tell you to stop,
Doctor.

03:56.812 --> 03:58.570
Yes. Finally.

03:59.723 --> 04:01.240
That's good.

04:02.317 --> 04:03.817
Could you talk me
through the advantages

04:03.819 --> 04:07.079
of operating at such a high
magnification, Dr. Kranepool?

04:07.081 --> 04:09.139
I've only read
that the field of view

04:09.141 --> 04:10.732
should be kept at a wide angle.

04:10.734 --> 04:12.492
Well, if you're lucky, you'll
reach a point in your career

04:12.494 --> 04:14.253
where you don't need books

04:14.255 --> 04:16.421
of basic anatomy--
though I have my doubts.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.331

-of our field of vision.
I'm zooming out, Doctor.

04:27.342 --> 04:32.012
-Do not zoom out!
Point the camera inferior

04:32.014 --> 04:33.830
More.

04:33.832 --> 04:35.515
Now to the right.

keeps coming back.

05:19.227 --> 05:21.561
-Yeah? What?
-I'm not interested

you're itching to deliver

05:23.565 --> 05:27.050

05:27.052 --> 05:28.552
You are dangerously close

my favorite breakfast burrito.

The defining experience
of my life is abandonment.

05:35.819 --> 05:37.819
That's what you said.

05:37.821 --> 05:39.320
You disagree?

05:39.322 --> 05:41.173
I don't think that's true.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.491
Let me help you out.

05:43.493 --> 05:46.419
Do you surround yourself
with lower companions?

05:46.421 --> 05:49.497
Huh? Half-bright stoners
who won't ever leave

05:49.499 --> 05:52.926

feel special by association?

05:52.928 --> 05:54.594
(laughs)

05:54.596 --> 05:58.506
Do you gravitate toward
emotionally withholding women

05:58.508 --> 06:01.434
who reflect your false sense
of your own worthlessness?

06:02.529 --> 06:06.013
When you can't draw ego
sustenance from your acolytes,

06:06.015 --> 06:09.609
do you have grandiose fantasies
about who you might become

06:09.611 --> 06:12.746
to show your bio mom Billie
what a mistake she's made?

06:14.433 --> 06:17.376

So, Trevor, what do you know
about your birth father?

06:28.630 --> 06:30.463
TREVOR: All she told me
about my biological father

06:30.465 --> 06:32.874
was that he was
three years older than her,

06:32.876 --> 06:34.726
teenage ladies' man,

06:34.728 --> 06:35.977
-football stud.

-We got to record what happens.
-Trevor, listen to me. Stop.

06:52.896 --> 06:54.971
Okay, this is how it's gonna go.

06:54.973 --> 06:56.415
You only speak when spoken to.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.399
It's only "Yes, sir"
or "No, sir,"

06:58.401 --> 07:00.827
and keep your hands
in plain sight at all times.

07:00.829 --> 07:02.295
This is not a request.

07:03.165 --> 07:04.589
Morning, Officer.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.426
Sir, are you aware that
your right taillight is out?

07:07.428 --> 07:09.986
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about that, Officer.

07:09.988 --> 07:12.322
I ordered the part from Germany.

07:12.324 --> 07:14.215
It should be here tomorrow.
You know, it's kind of hard

07:14.217 --> 07:19.771
to track down European
vintage car parts locally.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.348
License and registration, please
-Sure.

07:22.350 --> 07:23.942
And then I'm gonna need you both

07:23.944 --> 07:26.361
to step out of the car,
gentlemen.

07:31.768 --> 07:33.785
Easy, all right?

07:33.787 --> 07:36.079
Just easy.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.462
Keep your hands on the car
where I can see 'em, gentlemen.

-what he does for a living.
-Hey, Trevor, chill.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.378
What was that?

07:52.380 --> 07:54.622
I mean, all you see is
two Black men in a car

07:54.624 --> 07:57.217
that's a little too nice,
so it must be stolen, right?

07:57.219 --> 07:59.644
Or we must be
into something illegal.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.629
-Trevor, easy. Trevor...
-And once you run the plates,

08:01.631 --> 08:04.040
-Trevor! Trevor!
-and they're clean, suddenly

08:09.548 --> 08:12.139
-Oh, I'm not your son.
-Son, put your hands
on that vehicle.

08:12.141 --> 08:13.992

09:40.229 --> 09:42.063
Yeah, but a problem

Well, what exactly
are you looking for?

09:46.995 --> 09:48.753
I need to know why she crashed.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.497
Telemetry strip
gives me a window

into her cardiac rhythm while
she was in the hospital, but...

09:54.261 --> 09:58.579
maybe we missed
an underlying arrhythmia.

he wants everything in here.

10:38.788 --> 10:41.473
Yeah, I'll bring it to him

11:26.520 --> 11:28.761
or an ischemic stroke?

11:28.763 --> 11:30.763
I know by the time
we did the scan,

11:30.765 --> 11:33.766
her brain was swollen, so...

11:33.768 --> 11:36.753
it might have been hard
to see something like that.

11:36.755 --> 11:38.922
You know, we've been through all
of her labs and her tox screen.

she was predisposed

12:17.145 --> 12:19.654
is that I'm a doctor.

12:21.633 --> 12:22.966
After my mom died,

12:23.059 --> 12:26.135
my dad was finally able
to remember to hang up his towel

12:26.137 --> 12:28.062
instead of tossing it
on the bed,

12:28.064 --> 12:30.397
which drove her crazy.

12:30.399 --> 12:33.001
I just kept telling him
how proud she'd be.

12:34.329 --> 12:37.005
And I'll say the same to you.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.819
Did Nic ever feel faint
or pass out as a kid,

12:42.821 --> 12:45.013
like when you guys were playing
sports or something?

12:46.933 --> 12:48.099
(exhales)

12:48.101 --> 12:50.268
Not that I can remember.

12:51.420 --> 12:53.271
Sorry.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.773
<i> LEELA:</i>
<i>He could have lost the patient.</i>

12:54.775 --> 12:56.349
<i> JESSICA:</i>
<i> He would have lost the patient</i>

12:56.351 --> 12:58.443
if it weren't for Dr. Devi.

12:59.521 --> 13:03.006
And then he told me to go stand
in the hallway.

13:03.008 --> 13:04.674
What would you do?

13:05.844 --> 13:08.286
You know that Kranepool and Bell
are super tight, right?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.955
They've been besties
since we used leeches.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.198
I'm aware of that.

13:12.200 --> 13:16.461
Also, the Hippocratic oath is:
"Do no harm."

13:16.463 --> 13:19.705
Not: "Stop an old white guy
who could destroy your career

13:19.707 --> 13:21.524
from maybe doing harm."

13:21.526 --> 13:22.801
I'm also aware of that.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.711
But if his skills are diminished
and he wrecks a patient,

13:25.713 --> 13:28.881
I would never forgive myself
for doing nothing.

13:28.883 --> 13:31.034
I get that.

13:31.036 --> 13:33.627
If you do decide
to make your concerns known,

13:33.629 --> 13:36.463
just find a way to do it
without leaving a paper trail

13:36.465 --> 13:39.058
or saying anything
that could be quoted, all right?

13:39.060 --> 13:41.227
(laughs)
What am I supposed to do?

13:41.229 --> 13:44.380
Communicate them
with an interpretive dance?

13:44.382 --> 13:45.639
(laughs)

13:45.641 --> 13:47.383
I would pay to see that.

13:47.385 --> 13:50.219
You're not being helpful.

13:50.221 --> 13:52.163
All right, I'm sorry.
I'm just...

13:52.165 --> 13:54.999
I'm just too tired to think
right now.

13:56.227 --> 13:58.061
Well, maybe Conrad
will be back soon,

13:58.063 --> 14:00.154
and you won't have
to keep covering his shifts.

14:00.156 --> 14:02.549
He is on his own schedule.

14:04.493 --> 14:05.993
But I miss you.

14:05.995 --> 14:07.503
I miss you, too.

14:08.573 --> 14:10.497
I'm gonna have
to force myself to eat

14:10.499 --> 14:13.500
before my next surgery
with Kranepool.

14:13.502 --> 14:16.929
AUSTIN: 40-ish male versus
scooter high speed.

14:16.931 --> 14:19.673
Airway secured during the field.
Level-1 trauma now.

14:19.675 --> 14:21.025
Bay Ten.

14:22.178 --> 14:24.988
AUSTIN:
Let's go, fellas.

14:29.761 --> 14:30.943
DEVON:
All right, on my count.

14:30.945 --> 14:33.997
One, two, three.

14:35.191 --> 14:37.625
All right,
I'm starting the primary survey.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.620
Crackles bilaterally.

14:40.622 --> 14:42.213
He's tachy to the 150s.
Let's get him on a vent.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.290
Let's get a vent in here!

14:44.292 --> 14:46.217
The field cric
is perfectly done.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.095
-This your work?
-Me and the kid.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.211
Aortic regurgitation due
to severely damaged valve.

14:57.213 --> 14:58.638
He's in rapid heart failure.

14:58.640 --> 15:02.483
Call to the OR.
Book an emergency sternotomy.

15:04.979 --> 15:06.796
-Hey, AJ.
-Yeah?

15:06.798 --> 15:09.799
-Were you at the scene
of the accident?
-Oh, yeah.

15:09.801 --> 15:12.059
Officer Winnaker pulled us over
and out of the car

15:12.061 --> 15:14.395
for driving-while-Black,
then he pulled his gun out

15:14.397 --> 15:16.806
and he got hit by the scooter.

15:16.808 --> 15:18.065
-His gun?
-Yeah.

15:18.234 --> 15:21.327
Are you sure you're in the right
headspace to work on him?

15:21.329 --> 15:23.496
Pravesh, I saved
the guy's life once already.

15:23.498 --> 15:26.424
I am not gonna lower
my batting average to .500,

15:26.426 --> 15:29.427
patient's bad intentions
notwithstanding.

15:35.493 --> 15:37.101
Thank you.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.952
Hello, Dr. Devi.

15:54.846 --> 15:56.437
I have cried twice this morning

15:56.439 --> 15:59.457
trying to choose
a replacement for Nic.

16:04.947 --> 16:06.631
Are you all right?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.800
Say something, dear.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.617
(loud crunching)

16:11.620 --> 16:14.222
There's something
you need to communicate to me?

16:16.034 --> 16:17.183
(crunch)

16:18.219 --> 16:21.062
Oh... you wish
to remain anonymous.

16:23.041 --> 16:24.540
Clever girl.

16:24.542 --> 16:27.393
So, uh, does this concern
another doctor at the hospital?

16:27.395 --> 16:28.728
(crunch)

16:28.730 --> 16:31.714
A surgeon you've worked with?

16:31.716 --> 16:32.806
(crunch)

16:32.826 --> 16:37.311
Someone in whose OR
you've recently been?

16:37.313 --> 16:38.705
(crunch)

16:40.816 --> 16:42.458
Dr. Kranepool?

16:44.820 --> 16:46.170
Oh.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.564
Crunch no more.
I'll look into it.

16:48.566 --> 16:50.566
Oh, one more question.

16:50.568 --> 16:52.427
Can I have one of those?

16:53.329 --> 16:55.496
<i> BELL:</i>
<i> Aaron Kranepool?</i>

16:55.498 --> 16:57.923
-That's ridiculous.
-I've poked around.

16:57.925 --> 17:00.409
-His stats are declining
precipitously.
-Oh, come on, Kit,

17:00.411 --> 17:01.577
the guy's a machine.

17:01.579 --> 17:03.521
He's only a couple of years
older than me--

17:03.523 --> 17:05.765
-he still beats me at squash.
-You told me he cheats.

17:05.767 --> 17:09.769
Well, no, I think what I said
was he's highly competitive.

17:09.771 --> 17:12.697
I understand he's a good friend
and he's important to you.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.939
No, it's-it's more than that.

17:13.941 --> 17:15.867
He was a resident
when I was an intern,

17:15.869 --> 17:17.760
and an attending
when I was a resident,

17:17.762 --> 17:20.780
and he was... he was my example.

17:20.782 --> 17:23.190
I'm sure he was a damn good one,

17:23.192 --> 17:25.117
but it appears
things have changed.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.194
Now, wasn't he
just down at Hopkins

17:27.196 --> 17:29.196
for their
in-depth skills assessment?

17:29.198 --> 17:31.532
You know self-reporting
poor results

17:31.534 --> 17:33.033
for the Hopkins assessment
is optional.

17:33.035 --> 17:35.278
The only person who sees it
is the doctor being tested.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.797
Yeah, okay, okay.
So somebody reported him.

17:37.799 --> 17:40.207
I don't need to know who,
just...

17:40.209 --> 17:43.302
what exactly was said.

17:44.472 --> 17:48.808
I couldn't possibly repeat
verbatim what was told to me.

17:48.810 --> 17:50.068
Why not?

17:50.070 --> 17:52.461
You are an exemplary surgeon.

17:52.463 --> 17:55.464
I know you can't imagine
entering an OR

17:55.466 --> 17:58.058
without being in perfect mental
and physical shape.

17:58.060 --> 18:00.636
It would be anathema to you.

18:00.638 --> 18:02.080
(takes deep breath)

18:02.082 --> 18:05.524
Uh... well, exemplary,
I don't know.

18:05.526 --> 18:07.660
I need to know

18:07.662 --> 18:08.978
if there's even a small chance

18:08.980 --> 18:11.163
that Kranepool
could injure a patient.

18:11.165 --> 18:12.665
What do you need me to do?

18:12.667 --> 18:14.408
He has a surgery this afternoon.

18:14.410 --> 18:15.593
I'd like you to observe.

18:15.595 --> 18:19.580
Fine. I'm-I'm sure
whatever was said is overblown.

18:19.582 --> 18:20.990
Let's hope so.

18:22.176 --> 18:24.751
<i> CARR:</i>
<i> And you're absolutely sure</i>
<i> your hands were visible</i>

18:24.753 --> 18:25.678
the entire time?

18:25.847 --> 18:28.439
Oh, my God,
for the third time, yes...

18:28.441 --> 18:29.865
sir.

18:29.925 --> 18:31.925
We just want to make sure
we have an accurate account.

18:31.927 --> 18:33.669
Now, it's a natural reaction
to be angry

18:33.671 --> 18:34.837
when you're pulled over.

18:34.839 --> 18:36.763
Maybe you raised your voice,
took a step

18:36.765 --> 18:39.191
-towards Officer Winnaker...
-How do you guys do this
with a straight face, huh?

18:39.193 --> 18:41.677
I mean, if we were white,
we'd never be hands on the hood

18:41.679 --> 18:44.122
-for a damn taillight.
-Easy, now.
That's a serious accusation.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.365
Okay, I'm done answering
your transparent,

18:46.367 --> 18:48.684
-insulting questions.
-Excuse me, officers.

18:48.686 --> 18:51.354
I'm pretty sure
you have all you need.

18:51.356 --> 18:52.463
You have our phone numbers.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.357
If you need
any more information,

18:54.359 --> 18:56.467
you know how to contact us.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.784
We'll be in touch.

18:57.786 --> 19:00.012
-Thank you.
-TREVOR: Mm-hmm.

19:03.792 --> 19:05.125
(Austin sighs)

19:06.128 --> 19:09.480
You want to watch me operate
on Officer Winnaker?

19:10.316 --> 19:12.966
Yeah, I'm a little busy, so...

19:12.968 --> 19:14.318
I'll pass.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.820
Oh, yeah?

19:15.822 --> 19:18.881
What, you got to go home
and cook up some Molly?

19:19.808 --> 19:22.234
Go to the admin office
on the second floor.

19:22.236 --> 19:25.121
You have to fill out
some paperwork.

19:33.231 --> 19:35.656
What is going on
with you and Trevor?

19:36.676 --> 19:39.568
He called me this morning
and we had breakfast.

19:39.570 --> 19:41.420
Okay, I told you,
this is very complicated for me.

19:41.422 --> 19:43.380
And with Nic gone,
I'm already pretty ragged.

19:43.382 --> 19:46.258
-I don't need this, AJ.
-I get it, I get it. I'm sorry.

19:46.260 --> 19:48.669
Bringing him here
was not part of the plan.

19:48.671 --> 19:51.689
But then there seemed to be
a lesson in there

19:51.691 --> 19:54.192
-that the kid could learn...
-Wait, who asked you
to give life lessons

19:54.194 --> 19:56.736
to the kid I gave up?

19:59.273 --> 20:01.532
Why are you so angry with him?

20:02.443 --> 20:04.443
-(sighs)
-Huh?

20:04.445 --> 20:06.019
He's curious about his genes.

20:06.021 --> 20:09.265
He has a suspicion that nature
has a bigger hand in who he is

20:09.267 --> 20:11.450
than nurture,
and those kind of questions

20:11.452 --> 20:13.527
can torture a kid.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.046
They tortured me.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.048
You're overstepping,

20:17.050 --> 20:19.050
and you need to stop.

20:28.119 --> 20:30.786
What did I tell you?

20:30.788 --> 20:33.564
Look at this run of PVCs.

20:34.475 --> 20:35.882
Yeah, but it's...

20:35.884 --> 20:38.552
I know she had a significant
brain injury at the time,

20:38.554 --> 20:41.513
but before you say
anything else, look at this.

20:41.515 --> 20:44.408
From when Nic got stabbed.
Her EKGs.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.968
Okay.

20:45.970 --> 20:47.653
Multiple PVCs.

20:47.655 --> 20:51.657
This could be the answer
to something, but...

20:51.659 --> 20:53.325
I don't know what.

20:53.327 --> 20:56.420
Uh, she could have had
a genetic heart condition.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.572
Her mother died young-- maybe
that's what happened to Nic.

20:58.574 --> 21:00.833
Did GiGi inherit it?

21:00.835 --> 21:03.094
If I know, I can address it.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.660
When my father died, you
let me do what I needed to do,

21:11.662 --> 21:14.230
and I want to repay
that kindness to you.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.107
But what you found

21:16.258 --> 21:18.609
are a few premature
ventricular contractions,

21:18.611 --> 21:20.594
all when Nic was sick,
post-stabbing,

21:20.596 --> 21:23.614
or with, ultimately,
a fatal brain injury.

21:25.601 --> 21:28.953
Do you honestly...

21:28.955 --> 21:31.497
find this significant?

21:33.518 --> 21:34.683
Because...

21:34.685 --> 21:36.852
I know it's not meaningful,
and I know that

21:36.854 --> 21:38.587
because of what you taught me.

21:48.866 --> 21:51.058
<i> Bearing the Unbearable.</i>

21:51.902 --> 21:54.645
<i> The Other Side of Sadness.</i>

21:54.647 --> 21:56.314
(tosses book)

21:57.466 --> 22:00.801
<i> How to Go On Living</i>
<i> When Someone You Love Dies.</i>

22:00.803 --> 22:01.968
(tosses book)

22:01.970 --> 22:03.896
Those books
don't have the answer I need

22:03.898 --> 22:06.365
when GiGi asks me
how her mother died.

22:12.648 --> 22:14.415
(monitor beeping steadily)

22:15.393 --> 22:17.409
AUSTIN:
The heart is exposed.

22:17.411 --> 22:19.587
Prepare the bypass catheters.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.231
Oh.

22:22.233 --> 22:24.991
-Well, that could be a problem.
-Dr. Austin?

22:24.993 --> 22:28.404
The proximal aorta was damaged
in the trauma.

22:28.406 --> 22:31.240
People, we have to work quickly
if we don't want...

22:31.242 --> 22:34.000
(monitor beeping rapidly)

22:34.002 --> 22:36.428
Ruptured aorta.

22:36.430 --> 22:38.914
All right, everybody, listen up,
there's a new plan.

22:38.916 --> 22:40.858
All eyes on me.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.526
We're gonna have to crash
on pump.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.420
You two cannulate
the femoral artery.

22:44.422 --> 22:47.180
I will cannulate the IVC
through the right atrium.

22:47.182 --> 22:49.274
Be ready to start bypass
on my order.

22:49.276 --> 22:51.110
We are against the clock,
people,

22:51.112 --> 22:53.037
so let's move fast.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.635
All right, clamp number one.

23:11.799 --> 23:13.432
Scalpel.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.483
Catheter.

23:26.239 --> 23:29.222
ANESTHESIOLOGIST:
BP 87/48 and dropping.

23:29.224 --> 23:32.993
Let's start the bypass. Cool
the blood to 18 degrees Celsius.

23:35.063 --> 23:36.805
JESSICA:
Did we do it, Dr. Austin?

23:36.807 --> 23:38.749
AUSTIN:
You did great.
But don't get too excited.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.977
That was just step one
in keeping this man alive.

23:41.979 --> 23:44.313
Once his temperature cools
to 18 degrees,

23:44.315 --> 23:47.258
we will drain all the blood
out of his body.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.334
-TREVOR: The hell?
-And then we will perform

23:49.336 --> 23:53.097
a two-hour repair in 20 minutes
to give him his blood back

23:53.099 --> 23:55.724
before he goes brain-dead.

23:57.845 --> 23:59.920
Devi, where you headed?

23:59.922 --> 24:01.513
OR One, Kranepool.

24:01.515 --> 24:03.015
Hear he's a disaster.

24:03.017 --> 24:04.667
It's our second dance
of the day.

24:04.669 --> 24:07.260
He almost killed a patient
and then threatened to exile me.

24:07.262 --> 24:08.446
I've been anxious all morning

24:08.448 --> 24:10.506
at the thought of returning
to his OR.

24:10.508 --> 24:12.508
I'm about to do battle
with a wicked spinal GBM.

24:12.510 --> 24:14.510
-Love to have you with me.
-I wish I could.

24:14.512 --> 24:16.603
Now let's hope I don't pass out
from the stress.

24:16.605 --> 24:18.372
(chuckles quietly)

24:21.852 --> 24:23.711
(dials)

24:25.131 --> 24:26.705
<i> -CONRAD: Hey.</i>
-Hey.

24:26.707 --> 24:29.115
You asked me if Nic
ever passed out playing sports--

24:29.117 --> 24:32.452
and she didn't-- but she
did faint a few times at school.

24:32.454 --> 24:34.638
Mm, when and what were
the circumstances?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.715
<i> Like, right before a big test.</i>

24:36.717 --> 24:38.458
<i> You know, midterm or a final.</i>

24:38.460 --> 24:40.536
It's probably nothing,
but I thought you should know.

24:40.538 --> 24:42.980
<i> -Can you do me a favor?</i>
-Name it.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.040
<i> I-I need you to call Kyle.</i>

24:45.042 --> 24:46.466
He's-he's not speaking to me.

24:46.468 --> 24:48.468
Just, you can make up some
excuse why you're calling him,

24:48.470 --> 24:50.713
and then,
I don't know, I just...

24:50.715 --> 24:54.474
I need you to ask him if Nic's
mom had a history of fainting.

24:54.476 --> 24:56.160
Will do.

25:05.229 --> 25:07.379
(suction whirring)

25:09.157 --> 25:12.325
Did your med school teach you
to assist the attending

25:12.327 --> 25:14.428
or get in his way?

25:15.181 --> 25:17.097
To assist, Dr. Kranepool.

25:22.596 --> 25:24.763
KRANEPOOL (groans):
Are you deaf and blind?

25:24.765 --> 25:26.840
LEELA:
No. I don't have either
of those disabilities.

25:26.842 --> 25:29.251
KRANEPOOL:
I've had enough.
You need to scrub out,

25:29.253 --> 25:30.844
get your eyes and ears checked.
Now.

25:30.846 --> 25:32.921
-I'm sorry, Dr. Kranepool.
-Get out!

25:32.923 --> 25:34.406
Now.

25:39.930 --> 25:41.430
(rapid beeping)

25:41.432 --> 25:43.499
ANESTHESIOLOGIST:
Patient is tachy to the 170s.

25:46.103 --> 25:48.629
I need suction over here.

25:50.866 --> 25:52.466
(suction whirring)

25:53.961 --> 25:55.110
BELL:
Gloves, please.

25:55.112 --> 25:56.628
-Thank you.
-(glove snaps)

25:56.630 --> 25:58.797
Randolph, what the hell?

25:58.799 --> 25:59.948
I was watching upstairs.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.559
Just looked like
you could use a hand.

26:01.561 --> 26:03.727
You were babysitting me?

26:03.729 --> 26:04.895
BELL:
Suction.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.288
Lap pad.

26:06.290 --> 26:07.731
(rapid beeping continues)

26:12.129 --> 26:14.554
And clamp.

26:14.556 --> 26:15.739
(rapid beeping stops)

26:19.970 --> 26:22.896
-KRANEPOOL: You crossed a line.
-Look, you shouldn't even
have been in the neighborhood

26:22.898 --> 26:24.473
of the right hepatic,
then you blew through it

26:24.475 --> 26:26.325
and you couldn't find it while
your patient was bleeding out.

26:26.327 --> 26:27.501
You didn't leave me any choice.

26:35.669 --> 26:36.635
(sighs)

26:43.327 --> 26:44.993
You've got a set of balls
on you.

26:44.995 --> 26:47.179
Hey, we need to have
an honest conversation

26:47.181 --> 26:49.023
about your fitness for surgery.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.501
-Are you for real?
-Oh, come on, Aaron,

26:52.503 --> 26:54.260
what happened in there was
very problematic.

26:54.262 --> 26:56.188
Oh, please.
You put on your cape

26:56.190 --> 26:58.098
and flew in for a minor miscue.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.117
You're a nervous Nellie.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.119
You should be embarrassed.

27:04.031 --> 27:07.374
(sighs)
Will you show me the results
of your Hopkins tests?

27:08.519 --> 27:10.294
When did you become
so sanctimonious?

27:10.296 --> 27:11.687
Surgery is rarely flawless.

27:11.689 --> 27:13.372
-There are always complications.
-You used to be

27:13.374 --> 27:15.466
the closest thing to flawless
I've ever seen.

27:15.468 --> 27:21.029
I recall an appendectomy
you performed a few years back.

27:21.031 --> 27:22.381
Your patient died on your table.

27:22.383 --> 27:24.624
I didn't come knocking
on your door, did I?

27:24.626 --> 27:26.459
But you should have.

27:26.461 --> 27:29.054
I'm not the same man I was
four years ago.

27:29.056 --> 27:30.630
-You got that right.
-It's the greatest regret
of my life,

27:30.632 --> 27:32.224
putting my own self-interest
ahead of my patients'.

27:32.226 --> 27:33.709
And if you want
to hold me accountable

27:33.711 --> 27:35.727
for the appendectomy,
I will take what comes.

27:35.729 --> 27:38.489
Good God, you've lost your way.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.566
For the sake of our friendship,

27:41.568 --> 27:43.643
don't mention
my surgical skills again.

27:43.645 --> 27:45.996
I'll see you
on the squash court tonight.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.556
A good, old-fashioned drubbing

27:47.558 --> 27:51.210
will put your feet back
on the ground where they belong.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.422
(door closes)

27:56.658 --> 27:59.234
Right now
he's an enormous liability.

27:59.236 --> 28:01.737
I wish I could fire him,
but we both know

28:01.739 --> 28:04.164
-how difficult that is.
-That's like firing
a tenured professor.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.499
Plus, he's an icon.

28:06.501 --> 28:09.594
And he's entitled
to due process.

28:09.596 --> 28:10.762
Well, it's a moot point.

28:10.764 --> 28:13.081
We don't have
the necessary documentation

28:13.083 --> 28:15.508
-to prove he's dangerous.
-True.

28:15.510 --> 28:17.269
And most
of his patients' complications

28:17.271 --> 28:19.697
fall under "acceptable" risks
of surgery.

28:19.699 --> 28:22.157
Oh, the system doesn't work.

28:23.594 --> 28:25.260
Yeah, well...

28:25.262 --> 28:27.596
we've been allowed to build
too high a wall

28:27.598 --> 28:29.264
to protect ourselves.

28:29.266 --> 28:32.434
Bottom line,
Kranepool is a time bomb,

28:32.436 --> 28:35.963
and I don't want him exploding
on my watch.

28:36.790 --> 28:37.881
(sighs)

28:37.883 --> 28:39.216
<i> CONRAD:</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

28:39.218 --> 28:41.293
We're getting close, kiddo.

28:41.295 --> 28:44.296
Grandpa Kyle told Aunt Billie

28:44.298 --> 28:47.891
that Mama and her mama
both fainted

28:47.893 --> 28:50.227
a few times over the years.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.896
-Yeah. Yeah.
-(squeals happily)

28:52.898 --> 28:55.524
Always in the summer.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.126
I know.

28:58.128 --> 28:59.978
Always in the summer,
when it's hot

28:59.980 --> 29:01.797
and they were dehydrated.

29:01.799 --> 29:04.800
They didn't think
it was significant back then,

29:04.802 --> 29:06.151
but now...

29:06.153 --> 29:09.154
I think... it is very...

29:09.156 --> 29:11.656
very significant.

29:11.658 --> 29:15.978
We got a couple more things
we need to do.

29:15.980 --> 29:17.996
-(squeals happily)
-Okay? Oh?

29:17.998 --> 29:19.739
Yeah, you like that?

29:19.741 --> 29:23.076
Couple more pieces
to complete our puzzle.

29:23.078 --> 29:24.762
-(speaks baby talk)
-But I promise you,

29:24.764 --> 29:28.474
I promise you I won't stop until
we have all the answers we need.

29:34.014 --> 29:36.331
Hey, Conrad.

29:36.333 --> 29:38.275
-Listen, about today...
-Ah, forget it.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.502
I think I've figured it out.

29:40.504 --> 29:43.781
-Okay.
-Nic has a family history
of early death,

29:43.783 --> 29:45.173
starting with her mom.

29:45.175 --> 29:47.175
They both had fainting spells.

29:47.177 --> 29:49.269
Nic had PVCs on the monitor.

29:49.271 --> 29:52.364
-Yes, but she had a normal echo
and a normal EKG.
-Which proves my point.

29:52.366 --> 29:54.032
Everything we're talking about
is characteristic

29:54.034 --> 29:56.126
of catecholaminergic
polymorphic VT.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.853
(Devon sighs)

29:57.855 --> 29:59.630
Listen.

29:59.632 --> 30:02.040
Are you serious?

30:02.042 --> 30:03.950
Do you know how rare that is?

30:03.952 --> 30:05.618
But it makes perfect sense.

30:05.620 --> 30:08.472
A genetic form
of sudden cardiac failure.

30:09.624 --> 30:10.699
Conrad...

30:11.702 --> 30:14.353
You can have
a normal resting heart function.

30:15.964 --> 30:19.983
But stress and physical exertion
can cause serious arrhythmia.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.227
You can pass out, even die.

30:22.229 --> 30:24.229
Fine. I mean, that is possible.

30:24.231 --> 30:26.306
All the panic attacks Nic had,

30:26.308 --> 30:28.308
everything that we thought
was the thyroid,

30:28.310 --> 30:30.494
that could have been CPVT.

30:31.980 --> 30:33.405
Yes, it's a compelling theory...

30:33.407 --> 30:35.148
She's stressed out
on the drive home,

30:35.150 --> 30:36.558
rushing to get back to us.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.560
That could have sparked
the arrhythmia.

30:38.562 --> 30:40.212
Wait a second.

30:42.490 --> 30:45.734
But it is a theory
without evidence.

30:45.736 --> 30:47.586
That's why I brought GiGi in.

30:47.588 --> 30:51.014
I'm gonna have her tested
for the CPVT gene.

30:53.093 --> 30:54.560
Then I'll know.

31:01.752 --> 31:05.511
So, um, how many times did
that cop almost die in there?

31:05.513 --> 31:08.848
-Mm, by my count, three.
-Right, right.

31:08.850 --> 31:10.868
So, um,
why'd you go above and beyond

31:10.870 --> 31:13.095
and give this guy
the chance to destroy

31:13.097 --> 31:14.930
a few more brothers
down the road?

31:14.932 --> 31:17.265
(chuckles softly)
Look, the best I can do

31:17.267 --> 31:19.784
in the face of ignorance
is be better.

31:19.786 --> 31:22.454
My excellence is
the best revenge.

31:22.456 --> 31:25.774
So you think this guy
is gonna change his worldview

31:25.776 --> 31:30.370
because a Black doctor saved
his life with his "excellence"?

31:30.372 --> 31:32.222
(laughs):
Come on, man, that's naive.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.932
Whoa, hold up, slow your roll.

31:34.709 --> 31:37.895
It's not about the cop,
Sherlock.

31:37.897 --> 31:40.063
It's about me.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.732
Saint or sinner,

31:41.734 --> 31:44.292
they all get treated the same
underneath my knife.

31:44.294 --> 31:46.420
In the sanctity of my OR,

31:46.422 --> 31:48.563
there is no place
for moral relativism.

31:49.633 --> 31:52.651
When the world around me
is irredeemable,

31:52.653 --> 31:54.995
I am a righteous man.

31:57.141 --> 31:59.583
What kind of man
do you want to be?

32:06.241 --> 32:08.508
(door opens, closes)

32:11.430 --> 32:14.580
I have an early surgery
tomorrow, so let's not dawdle.

32:14.582 --> 32:15.840
I believe it's my serve.

32:15.842 --> 32:17.267
You served the ball
out of bounds this morning,

32:17.269 --> 32:18.660
so it's actually my serve.

32:18.662 --> 32:19.752
No.

32:19.754 --> 32:21.329
If we're gonna settle this
on the court,

32:21.331 --> 32:23.181
we got to play
by the same rules.

32:23.183 --> 32:25.192
The hell
is that supposed to mean?

32:38.699 --> 32:40.624
(panting)

32:44.463 --> 32:46.296
One-zero.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.017
(Kranepool groans)

33:15.661 --> 33:18.453
(Kranepool groaning)

33:22.743 --> 33:24.668
(panting)

33:27.731 --> 33:29.339
Seven-nothing.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.674
(both panting)

33:32.160 --> 33:34.553
I've been letting you win
for the past year.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.164
You're not good enough.

33:38.166 --> 33:39.758
Look, you taught me
how to play the game.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.019
I could see how unbearable
it was for you to lose,

33:42.021 --> 33:43.578
so I've just been ignoring
the bad calls.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.230
Serve the damn ball.

33:52.923 --> 33:53.739
-(grunts)
-(groans)

33:54.941 --> 33:58.493
No, I'm all right... fine.

34:04.618 --> 34:07.285
It's your peripheral vision.
We both know that.

34:08.438 --> 34:11.631
I can put the ball where
you can't find it every time.

34:12.793 --> 34:15.093
Serve the ball.

34:21.894 --> 34:24.603
(groaning)

34:27.549 --> 34:29.107
(both panting)

34:35.390 --> 34:38.492
I take no joy in this, A.K.

34:40.061 --> 34:41.636
People are getting hurt.

34:41.638 --> 34:43.729
This is your exit ramp.
Just-just take it.

34:43.731 --> 34:47.250
Rest on your laurels
before you destroy them.

34:48.645 --> 34:50.862
I have no hobbies
and three alimonies.

34:50.864 --> 34:53.815
What the hell am I supposed
to do with the rest of my life?

34:53.817 --> 34:55.759
I don't know.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.470
But you got to find a new game.

35:00.748 --> 35:02.682
(exhales)

35:08.498 --> 35:11.233
(grunts)

35:24.698 --> 35:26.623
(faucet running)

35:30.203 --> 35:32.087
(turns off faucet)

35:33.966 --> 35:35.465
(sighs heavily)

35:47.795 --> 35:48.979
To answer your question,

35:48.981 --> 35:50.963
I'm not angry at him.

35:50.965 --> 35:52.816
I'm trying to protect him.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.058
From you?

35:54.060 --> 35:56.044
He's not the product
of first love.

35:56.046 --> 35:57.729
I was raped.

35:57.731 --> 35:59.230
By our neighbor.

35:59.232 --> 36:01.658
I was 13. He was a grown man.

36:02.402 --> 36:03.401
Billie...

36:03.495 --> 36:06.830
Trevor wants to know
who his father is.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.499
Is that an answer anyone needs?

36:11.319 --> 36:13.211
Damn.

36:15.156 --> 36:17.248
I can't even...

36:17.250 --> 36:21.344
begin to understand
that kind of pain.

36:22.848 --> 36:27.625
And I can only imagine how hard
it is to even say those words.

36:27.627 --> 36:30.428
So I'm honored
that you shared that with me.

36:30.430 --> 36:32.597
-And, Billie, I am so...
-AJ,

36:32.599 --> 36:35.007
don't say you're sorry.

36:35.009 --> 36:37.101
You're a good man.

36:37.103 --> 36:39.196
Just stay in your lane.

36:44.428 --> 36:46.411
(door opens)

36:47.431 --> 36:48.997
(door closes)

36:57.031 --> 36:59.174
You get the results?

37:01.386 --> 37:04.054
Uh...

37:04.056 --> 37:05.947
negative.

37:05.949 --> 37:07.449
She doesn't have it.

37:07.451 --> 37:09.059
And...

37:09.061 --> 37:11.186
Nic probably didn't, either.

37:13.881 --> 37:15.899
A million things happen
every second

37:15.901 --> 37:18.485
to every single person
on the planet.

37:21.965 --> 37:25.391
Some are joyful,

37:25.393 --> 37:27.485
most are inconsequential,

37:27.487 --> 37:29.137
and a few...

37:29.139 --> 37:31.748
(choked up):
are unbearable.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.128
Those are the hardest ones
to explain.

37:40.834 --> 37:45.053
Can you make peace with that?

37:56.090 --> 37:58.458
You've been talking at me
nonstop all day.

37:58.460 --> 38:01.927
What happened, you, uh, you
run out of words or something?

38:01.929 --> 38:03.521
(wry chuckle)

38:03.523 --> 38:04.930
Not possible.

38:04.932 --> 38:07.742
(laughs)
Yeah, I didn't think so.

38:09.362 --> 38:12.030
Hey, so would it be cool
if I come back to watch

38:12.032 --> 38:13.681
some more of your surgeries?

38:13.683 --> 38:15.458
Look, Trevor, um...

38:16.369 --> 38:19.020
Look, we can keep meeting up,
right?

38:19.022 --> 38:21.113
You know, grab something to eat,
chop it up.

38:21.115 --> 38:23.115
-Yeah.
-But, um...

38:23.117 --> 38:26.678
we're gonna have to steer clear
of Chastain.

38:29.699 --> 38:31.975
She, uh, she told you
not to bring me around?

38:31.977 --> 38:34.060
Yeah.

38:42.896 --> 38:44.395
What the hell
did I ever do to her?

38:44.397 --> 38:45.730
Nothing.

38:45.732 --> 38:47.398
Now, this is not on you.

38:47.400 --> 38:50.068
This is no reflection
of your worth, Trevor.

38:50.070 --> 38:52.904
This is about Billie.

38:52.906 --> 38:55.165
All right?
You haven't done anything wrong.

38:55.167 --> 38:57.075
Yeah, it doesn't feel
like that, man.

38:57.077 --> 38:59.227
I know. I know, man.

38:59.229 --> 39:03.989
And I know in the moment
you may feel... disposable.

39:03.991 --> 39:05.750
But you are not.

39:05.752 --> 39:08.011
Billie's got her own story, man.

39:08.013 --> 39:11.014
She... she's got her own damage.

39:12.242 --> 39:14.684
You're just caught up
in the crossfire.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.746
You hear me?

39:18.748 --> 39:20.582
Yeah.

39:20.584 --> 39:22.525
Yeah, I hear you.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.653
All right.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.594
♪

39:32.596 --> 39:35.688
I'm embarrassed to admit it,
but I'm still not even sure

39:35.690 --> 39:38.491
I did the right thing
reporting Kranepool.

39:39.527 --> 39:41.044
Look, Kranepool
almost killed someone

39:41.046 --> 39:42.620
after he banned you from his OR.

39:42.622 --> 39:45.273
If you hadn't told Kit,
Bell wouldn't have been in there

39:45.275 --> 39:47.092
to save the patient's life.

39:49.554 --> 39:50.962
Thank you.

39:50.964 --> 39:52.872
For what?

39:52.874 --> 39:55.283
For confirming what I believe.

39:55.285 --> 39:57.227
That people deserve the truth,

39:57.229 --> 40:00.647
no matter how complicated
or painful it can be.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.733
To friends, old and new.

40:05.404 --> 40:06.653
(chuckles)

40:09.299 --> 40:11.449
(sighs)
Everything hurts.

40:12.894 --> 40:16.746
Well, not to minimize
your discomfort...

40:16.748 --> 40:19.323
but it was worth it.

40:19.325 --> 40:22.326
Aaron Kranepool has retired.

40:22.328 --> 40:25.130
(sighing)

40:28.927 --> 40:30.927
Well...

40:30.929 --> 40:34.172
I'm relieved, but...

40:34.174 --> 40:36.081
maybe a little heartbroken.

40:36.083 --> 40:38.935
You've saved
who knows how many lives.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.846
I lost an old friend
in the bargain.

40:41.848 --> 40:43.440
You've done him
a great service as well.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.500
Perhaps one day
he'll figure that out.

40:45.502 --> 40:47.426
-(exhales)
-Oh, come on, look,

40:47.428 --> 40:50.196
your posture cannot be helping
your discomfort. Scooch down.

40:51.508 --> 40:53.357
(groans in pain)

40:53.359 --> 40:55.359
-Wait, wait, wait.
-(laughs)

40:55.361 --> 40:57.028
(long exhale)

40:57.030 --> 40:59.104
-How does that feel?
-Good, really...

40:59.106 --> 41:00.957
(chuckles)
That's good.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.533
Just promise me

41:02.535 --> 41:05.462
when it's time for me to hang up
my squash racket, you'll...

41:05.464 --> 41:07.021
just-just tell me

41:07.023 --> 41:09.114
-in no uncertain terms.
-Oh, you know I will.

41:09.116 --> 41:10.692
No, I do know that.

41:10.694 --> 41:12.677
It gives me great comfort.

41:14.047 --> 41:16.455
(takes deep breath)

41:16.457 --> 41:20.793
Should we have that dinner
we've been trying to have?

41:20.795 --> 41:22.645
I'd like that.

41:24.207 --> 41:26.149
(Bell takes deep breath)

41:26.151 --> 41:29.969
You know, Kit,
apropos of so many things,

41:29.971 --> 41:33.031
there's-there's no one's opinion
of me that matters more...

41:33.808 --> 41:35.307
...than yours.
