You... you have her number?

Oh, yeah, we go way back.

- I can't.

Of course you can come over.
You're my best friend.

a real New Yorker now.

19:31.115 --> 19:32.475
I mean, he had a gun.

19:32.481 --> 19:34.944
And then, he's ragging on me
about my balance?

19:34.950 --> 19:37.079
I'm like, "You're mugging me, bitch."

19:37.085 --> 19:38.948
What a bitch.

19:38.954 --> 19:43.085
That's a real garbage person. Totally.

19:43.091 --> 19:46.046
- Thanks again for having me over.
- Of course, obviously.

is how you 'belt it.

20:01.422 --> 20:04.018
- Don't!

get stuff so crazy, that was a lot.

20:16.770 --> 20:18.666

of some potential window displays,

20:38.625 --> 20:41.055
pulled some fabrics,

a new team look or something?

Directing Hannibal,
Arturo and Abbi, to me,

22:14.780 --> 22:16.776
if I'm not in the
scene, it's so much fun

22:16.782 --> 22:20.438
and it's just play. It's
just so fun and play.

22:20.445 --> 22:23.131
But being in the scene, I
felt very self-conscious

22:23.138 --> 22:25.837
because you can't even
filter your thoughts.

And it's really exciting
because even when they're

fighting, they're still
fighting as really
