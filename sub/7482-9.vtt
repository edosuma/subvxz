WEBVTT

00:16.831 --> 00:19.300
Come here. Come here.

00:23.304 --> 00:25.272
Did you check out
the new yoga instructor?

00:25.640 --> 00:27.665
- Dude looks like an inbred caveman.
- Ha, ha.

00:27.842 --> 00:30.174
Your lack of compassion
is what's keeping you stuck

00:30.345 --> 00:33.076
- in a cycle of karmic retribution.
- Ha, ha.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.585
- Come on.
- Shh. Be quiet.

00:57.939 --> 00:59.532
Who's out there?

01:00.008 --> 01:01.032
Come on, guys.

01:01.376 --> 01:04.471
You know the curfew.
Now, get back to your...

01:04.879 --> 01:06.369
Oh, my God.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.547
You tracking someone by their ink?

01:47.722 --> 01:49.053
Just looking.

01:49.224 --> 01:51.818
- Looking for who?
- For me.

01:51.993 --> 01:53.358
Ha, ha. You're gonna get a tat?

01:54.362 --> 01:57.332
- I didn't say I was gonna actually...
- Don't take this the wrong way.

01:57.498 --> 01:58.522
I think I just did.

01:58.700 --> 02:02.728
But there are tat people
and then there's, well, you.

02:02.904 --> 02:05.498
I'm not a tat person?

02:05.673 --> 02:06.902
No.

02:07.075 --> 02:09.066
You and the ink council
had a little vote on this?

02:09.509 --> 02:11.137
I'm just trying to help you out, G.

02:11.312 --> 02:14.043
Tat's a permanent thing,
it's not a temporary fashion trend.

02:14.215 --> 02:16.240
You know Kensi and Deeks have tats,
right?

02:16.417 --> 02:18.112
You don't have a problem with that?

02:18.286 --> 02:20.050
- Nope.
- Heh.

02:20.221 --> 02:21.950
- I'm just curious.
- Hmm?

02:22.123 --> 02:25.354
What makes somebody
a, uh... A tat person?

02:25.860 --> 02:27.851
Well, if you have to ask...

02:31.699 --> 02:33.690
Why are we all smiling?

02:34.202 --> 02:35.966
Callens gonna get a tattoo.

02:36.437 --> 02:37.700
- You...
- Really?

02:37.872 --> 02:39.931
Looking online.
I didn't say I was gonna actually...

02:40.108 --> 02:41.803
Look, don't take this the wrong way...

02:43.311 --> 02:45.575
- I think the tribal bands...
- You have to do...

02:46.648 --> 02:48.116
Welcome to the gun show.

02:49.984 --> 02:54.217
- That, on the other hand, is awesome.
- No offense.

02:54.822 --> 02:56.847
Tat guy. I gotcha.

02:57.592 --> 03:00.254
Naval Intelligence Officer
Gary Leonida.

03:00.428 --> 03:02.188
Until two months ago,
he was posted to Kabul.

03:02.330 --> 03:04.230
He was on leave back here in L.A.

03:04.399 --> 03:06.697
A counselor found his body
floating in a pool last night.

03:06.868 --> 03:08.393
- A counselor?
- Yes.

03:08.569 --> 03:10.367
Unbeknownst to his superiors,

03:10.538 --> 03:14.805
Mr. Leonida had checked himself
into Tranquility Villa rehab.

03:14.976 --> 03:18.105
A type of high-end rehab
in Malibu with equine therapy

03:18.279 --> 03:19.678
and, of course, private chefs.

03:19.847 --> 03:22.373
And massage therapists,
kayaking, surfing, acupuncture.

03:22.550 --> 03:24.575
Did I mention massage therapists?

03:24.752 --> 03:26.516
Sounds more like
a Palm Springs spa.

03:26.688 --> 03:30.283
More like a temporary dry out
for the rich and spoiled.

03:30.458 --> 03:32.950
Fifty grand a month keeps the owners
driving their Ferraris

03:33.127 --> 03:34.424
and eating at Nobu every night.

03:34.595 --> 03:36.859
So a naval officer,
emotionally vulnerable,

03:37.031 --> 03:39.125
with a head full of sensitive intel.

03:39.300 --> 03:42.497
You can understand
that SECNAV is naturally concerned.

03:42.670 --> 03:45.105
She wants for us to make sure

03:45.273 --> 03:48.140
that our country's intelligence
hasn't been compromised.

03:48.309 --> 03:51.472
- What kind of intelligence?
- The need-to-know kind.

03:51.913 --> 03:55.816
Evidently, SECNAV feels
that we don't have the need yet.

03:56.250 --> 03:58.082
- How did he die?
- He drowned.

03:58.252 --> 04:00.812
But according
to the preliminary toxicology report,

04:00.988 --> 04:03.355
he had high levels of oxycodone
in his system.

04:03.524 --> 04:06.619
The same substance he was addicted
to when he arrived three days ago.

04:06.794 --> 04:10.492
They suspect that after he overdosed,
he became disoriented, fell in the pool.

04:10.665 --> 04:13.066
- Family?
- Just an ex-wife back east.

04:13.234 --> 04:14.565
How many people at the rehab?

04:14.736 --> 04:17.603
Four permanent staff members,
half dozen daily counselors,

04:17.772 --> 04:19.069
and 16 patients.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.800
- Did Leonida have a roommate?
- No. He had a private room.

04:21.976 --> 04:24.911
But according to owner, Martin
Lake, he had a visitor yesterday.

04:25.246 --> 04:28.876
Val Winkler, a self-employed
carpenter, lives in Venice.

04:29.050 --> 04:32.020
With a record for possession
and small-time dealing.

04:32.186 --> 04:34.018
Deeks, Kensi,
why don't you check out Winkler?

04:34.489 --> 04:38.187
- Sam, should we drive up to Malibu?
- Let's doit.

04:38.359 --> 04:40.453
That's a good idea.

04:40.628 --> 04:45.429
Oh, and by the way, Mr. Callen,
that, uh, tattoo parlor on PCH,

04:46.968 --> 04:48.834
bad idea.

04:59.046 --> 05:01.014
We do a lot of good here.

05:01.582 --> 05:04.847
Still, for some,
all we can do just isn't enough.

05:05.853 --> 05:08.083
"The end of your addiction
begins with us.

05:08.256 --> 05:11.123
What you do with it ends with you."

05:11.292 --> 05:12.851
You saw my commercial.

05:13.027 --> 05:14.893
Five times
before the seventh inning stretch.

05:15.062 --> 05:17.793
Heh. Targeted television spots
are the best way

05:17.965 --> 05:19.399
to get our message across.

05:19.567 --> 05:21.626
Sporting events
are a socially acceptable way

05:21.803 --> 05:24.033
for alcoholics
to justify getting loaded.

05:24.205 --> 05:26.572
Well, room full of drinkers,
they fit right in.

05:26.741 --> 05:28.732
I know how Gary felt. I...

05:28.910 --> 05:31.504
I was there many times
before I finally got it.

05:31.679 --> 05:34.319
I'm just really grateful I was lucky
enough to be able to give back

05:34.482 --> 05:35.972
to those that are still struggling.

05:36.150 --> 05:38.710
Looks like giving back
has been pretty good to you.

05:38.886 --> 05:40.650
Yes, I've been very fortunate.

05:41.622 --> 05:43.954
Out here is where Gary drowned.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.492
The police just let us back in.

05:46.661 --> 05:50.120
We're gonna have a memorial service
later this afternoon on the beach.

05:50.298 --> 05:51.732
He checked in three days ago?

05:51.899 --> 05:53.424
Yes, for opiate addiction.

05:53.601 --> 05:55.797
Any idea how he got his hands
on the oxy?

05:55.970 --> 05:58.632
Usually, in these cases,
a friend brings in the drugs.

05:59.173 --> 06:02.268
Leonida's friend, Val Winkler,
stopped by to pay him a visit yesterday.

06:02.443 --> 06:03.467
Yeah?

06:03.644 --> 06:05.612
Winkler had a history of
dealing and addiction.

06:05.780 --> 06:07.680
We don't do background checks
on visitors.

06:07.849 --> 06:11.615
Unfortunately,
most new patients' friends are users.

06:11.786 --> 06:14.414
He checked in
under an assumed name.

06:14.589 --> 06:18.116
Anyone besides Winkler, the staff
or the patients know he was here?

06:18.292 --> 06:19.691
Not to our knowledge.

06:19.861 --> 06:21.741
How much interaction did he have
with the staff?

06:21.896 --> 06:24.126
Uh, not much. He was still detoxing.

06:24.298 --> 06:27.290
You have to clear
a person's head and mind

06:27.468 --> 06:29.266
before you can deliver the message.

06:29.437 --> 06:30.927
So no counseling sessions?

06:31.105 --> 06:32.903
No. He had an intake interview,

06:33.074 --> 06:35.406
but they don't get into causes
and conditions,

06:35.576 --> 06:37.977
it's just basic background stuff.

06:38.412 --> 06:40.039
You have a camera
down at the gate.

06:40.214 --> 06:42.148
Yes, for the access road
to the community.

06:42.316 --> 06:43.545
What about inside the villa?

06:43.718 --> 06:44.947
A couple.

06:45.119 --> 06:47.178
We'll need the footage
for the past three days.

06:47.355 --> 06:49.016
Of course.

06:57.265 --> 06:58.630
G.

07:08.643 --> 07:10.475
That's fresh.

07:12.914 --> 07:14.973
From somebody being dragged?

07:16.384 --> 07:18.375
That would change things.

07:23.124 --> 07:25.525
So Winkler
is a meth-head carpenter.

07:25.693 --> 07:28.219
- Bet he works fast at least.
- Ha, ha. That's funny.

07:28.763 --> 07:30.197
Wow, that's a lot of tin foil.

07:30.998 --> 07:33.433
He must have a plasma.
Glare can be a bitch.

07:35.369 --> 07:37.133
Federal agents, open up.

07:45.212 --> 07:46.338
One, two.

07:52.486 --> 07:55.217
The other man
can push through the gate.

08:00.328 --> 08:01.762
Okay.

08:06.334 --> 08:07.460
Federal agents.

08:07.635 --> 08:10.900
Come out slowly
with your hands in front of you.

08:22.717 --> 08:26.176
Well, there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo,

08:26.354 --> 08:27.753
and it's worth fighting for.

08:29.023 --> 08:30.047
What?

08:42.469 --> 08:45.097
You and Gary Leonida hit it off
at AA?

08:46.373 --> 08:47.636
Yes.

08:47.807 --> 08:50.674
A carpenter
and a naval intelligence officer.

08:51.845 --> 08:53.335
You wouldn't get it.

08:53.513 --> 08:55.880
Inside, we were the same.

08:56.049 --> 08:57.312
Screwed-up childhood,

08:57.784 --> 09:00.116
all fear and rage.

09:01.621 --> 09:05.489
When he talked about all that,
it was like listening to myself.

09:05.659 --> 09:07.855
- So you were sober buddies.
- Yeah.

09:08.728 --> 09:10.856
And doing good for a while.

09:11.231 --> 09:13.996
Till he relapsed,
checked into rehab.

09:14.567 --> 09:17.059
Used every penny he had
in the bank.

09:17.470 --> 09:19.495
Did Gary ever tell you about his job?

09:20.073 --> 09:21.871
Just that he worked
for the government.

09:22.575 --> 09:26.239
Like I said, we had
more important things to relate to.

09:26.413 --> 09:27.437
Are you buying this?

09:27.614 --> 09:29.309
If he was still wired, probably not.

09:29.482 --> 09:32.213
But he's coming down.
He's depressed.

09:32.385 --> 09:34.376
Could be
that just makes him more aware

09:34.554 --> 09:36.215
of what's at stake if he confesses.

09:36.389 --> 09:38.687
So when you went
to visit him yesterday,

09:38.858 --> 09:40.326
you were already
tweaked out on meth?

09:40.493 --> 09:42.154
I didn't see Gary yesterday.

09:42.328 --> 09:44.854
That's interesting
because rehab said that you did.

09:45.031 --> 09:49.025
Yeah, I was there,
but three days ago, not yesterday.

09:49.202 --> 09:51.364
Sure you're not mixing things up?
You were pretty high.

09:51.538 --> 09:52.835
No way.

09:53.006 --> 09:57.273
Meth hypes you bigtime,
but it doesn't dull your memory.

09:57.677 --> 10:00.806
I could probably tell you the color
of every person's shoes in that casino.

10:01.581 --> 10:02.673
You were at a casino?

10:03.216 --> 10:05.708
Yeah, Vegas. All day yesterday.

10:06.453 --> 10:08.444
I scored some crystal
and went to Excalibur.

10:08.621 --> 10:10.089
Where, in your drug-fueled haze,

10:10.256 --> 10:12.190
you were bombarded
with medieval images.

10:12.826 --> 10:14.817
Got backto L.A,
downloaded the game

10:14.994 --> 10:17.486
and really got into it.

10:17.664 --> 10:19.325
So much so that you attacked us.

10:19.499 --> 10:21.524
Thought we were orcs probably,

10:22.535 --> 10:25.095
Merthian Dwarves, after my silver.

10:26.106 --> 10:27.369
That tracks.

10:27.540 --> 10:31.272
Look, I know how screwed up I was.
That... That's what meth does, but...

10:31.544 --> 10:33.034
I... wanted Gary to get sober.

10:33.213 --> 10:35.841
I wouldn't bring him drugs.

10:36.116 --> 10:38.016
Besides, I'm a tweaker.

10:38.184 --> 10:40.915
I don't have any connections for oxy.

10:41.087 --> 10:45.490
Like a meth dealer has no idea
where to get any other kind of drugs.

10:45.658 --> 10:47.490
I'll have Eric pull
the security-cam footage

10:47.660 --> 10:49.754
from Excalibur and the rehab center.

10:49.929 --> 10:52.125
That will be our lie detector.

10:52.298 --> 10:54.995
We should be grateful
he kept his crazy at home.

10:55.168 --> 10:56.966
He could've showed up
in Medieval Times.

11:02.008 --> 11:03.601
- A henna?
- It will give you a chance

11:03.777 --> 11:06.405
to try the tattoo experience
with something not so permanent.

11:06.579 --> 11:09.412
- And then you'll realize it's not for you.
- Exactly.

11:09.582 --> 11:11.072
But you still get the thrill.

11:11.251 --> 11:13.219
It's like
that '80s Jermaine Stewart song.

11:13.386 --> 11:15.320
Says you can still have fun
with your clothes on?

11:15.488 --> 11:17.183
Exactly.

11:19.159 --> 11:21.890
Oh, my God,
Jermaine Stewart was so wrong.

11:22.662 --> 11:24.790
Well, security-camera footage
from Excalibur

11:24.964 --> 11:26.728
showed Winkler
in the casino yesterday.

11:27.433 --> 11:28.764
His alibi holds up.

11:29.202 --> 11:30.226
Sort of.

11:30.837 --> 11:33.329
This is security-cam footage
of Winkler

11:33.506 --> 11:35.804
driving through the front gate
at Tranquility Villa,

11:35.975 --> 11:37.909
also yesterday.

11:38.077 --> 11:40.478
Unless he's got a twin brother
or he's on the Enterprise,

11:40.647 --> 11:43.617
- something's not right.
- Traffic-cam footage from PCH.

11:43.783 --> 11:47.549
Now, this is Winkler heading up the hill
towards Tranquility Villa three days ago

11:47.720 --> 11:49.848
like he claimed,
but footage from yesterday

11:50.023 --> 11:52.924
shows no sign of him
ever passing this intersection.

11:53.092 --> 11:55.060
Now, it is possible that the time code

11:55.228 --> 11:57.492
on the rehab security footage
was altered.

11:57.664 --> 11:59.758
And more bad news.

11:59.933 --> 12:03.528
The autopsy report shows signs
of scopolamine in Leonida's system.

12:03.703 --> 12:06.195
Scopolamine can be used
as an interrogation drug.

12:06.372 --> 12:08.033
It's a form of truth serum.

12:09.676 --> 12:11.610
I think I hear a cry for help.

12:13.546 --> 12:15.139
All right.

12:17.250 --> 12:20.447
Tranquility Villa
hires outside contractors

12:20.620 --> 12:21.951
for many of their services.

12:22.121 --> 12:27.059
I thought going undercover
as a nutritionist would suit Mr. Deeks.

12:27.660 --> 12:28.855
- Great.
- Uh, no, no.

12:29.028 --> 12:31.520
Hetty, he had a burrito and a Pop-Tart
at 8:00 this morning,

12:31.698 --> 12:34.030
which he ate at the same time.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.431
I also had a glass of orange juice
and a multivitamin.

12:37.604 --> 12:40.574
A Flintstones chewable, actually,
which he only bought

12:40.740 --> 12:42.401
because they ran out
of SweeTARTS, so...

12:42.575 --> 12:43.736
They're delicious.

12:43.910 --> 12:46.709
Ooh. Poor attempt at humor
on my part, Miss Blye.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.508
I wanna reassure you
I had no intention.

12:49.682 --> 12:51.241
You will go in as the nutritionist.

12:52.919 --> 12:56.549
- And Mr. Deeks as a new patient.
- Not a problem.

12:56.723 --> 12:58.483
I've spent time with drug addicts
in my life,

12:58.625 --> 13:00.389
I can imitate them in my sleep.

13:01.027 --> 13:03.826
Actually, um,
I had something else in mind.

13:04.564 --> 13:08.501
Something more
in your natural wheelhouse.

13:09.869 --> 13:11.394
Didn't even know
I had a wheelhouse.

13:11.571 --> 13:13.403
Oh, you have a wheelhouse.

13:18.244 --> 13:21.009
Butterfly. Flower.

13:21.180 --> 13:24.912
No, a puppy. A kitty-cat.
A bunny rabbit.

13:25.084 --> 13:27.985
Why would you assume my tattoo
is something cute and sweet?

13:28.154 --> 13:30.418
I don't know. Because you are.

13:31.925 --> 13:34.257
It's a rose. Which means nothing

13:34.427 --> 13:37.192
because Axl Rose
also has a rose tattoo.

13:37.363 --> 13:39.092
That's his name.

13:39.565 --> 13:41.533
It's not his real name.

13:41.768 --> 13:42.860
Faziz.

13:43.036 --> 13:44.162
Axl Faziz?

13:44.337 --> 13:48.274
Anwir Faziz. He owns a car dealership
in the Valley.

13:48.708 --> 13:50.642
And he's on Homeland's radar.

13:50.810 --> 13:53.745
Suspected of being
a terrorist financier middleman.

13:53.913 --> 13:56.075
Who, according
to the dealership's bank records,

13:56.249 --> 13:58.843
just happened to lend Martin Lake,
the owner of the rehab,

13:59.018 --> 14:00.713
a large sum of money.

14:01.821 --> 14:04.449
Loan was made
to Tranquility Villa's corporation.

14:04.624 --> 14:08.060
Okay, I've got the Facebook page
of Faziz's son, Amir.

14:08.361 --> 14:11.058
Heh. He's gushing
about how Tranquility Villa

14:11.230 --> 14:12.356
saved his life a year ago.

14:12.532 --> 14:17.299
Right. So Lake is in financial trouble
and it's Faziz to the rescue.

14:17.470 --> 14:20.064
Puts Lake in debt to Faziz bigtime.

14:20.940 --> 14:22.408
He hasn't paid off the loan.

14:22.575 --> 14:24.339
- At least not with money.
- Hmm.

14:24.944 --> 14:28.505
And if he found out
Leonida was an intelligence officer...

14:28.681 --> 14:30.308
- I'll call Callen.
- Okay.

14:31.884 --> 14:34.764
Just saying when it comes to these
things, there are two kinds of people.

14:34.921 --> 14:37.083
- So no one's ever in the gray area?
- Okay.

14:37.256 --> 14:40.851
When you were in kindergarten,
saltines or grahams?

14:41.027 --> 14:42.188
Grahams.

14:42.362 --> 14:44.194
- Oatmeal or chocolate chip?
- Oatmeal.

14:44.364 --> 14:45.559
I rest my case.

14:45.732 --> 14:47.131
Well done, counselor.

14:47.533 --> 14:51.163
All right, look, I think we've established
beyond a doubt that I am not a tat guy.

14:51.337 --> 14:53.567
I suppose
I'm not a Ferrari guy either?

14:53.740 --> 14:56.437
Or Lambo or Bentley or Maserati.

14:56.609 --> 15:00.011
Uh-huh. But you, on the other hand,
you are a supercar guy.

15:00.179 --> 15:01.669
That goes without saying, G.

15:04.517 --> 15:06.178
Faziz.

15:06.519 --> 15:08.146
He may have his goon squad nearby.

15:08.321 --> 15:10.346
No, this is his legitimate business.

15:10.523 --> 15:12.582
Wouldn't make sense
to resist two federal agents

15:12.759 --> 15:14.625
that just wanna ask
a couple of questions.

15:19.899 --> 15:22.368
Outside now.

15:41.886 --> 15:43.718
How long have you been undercover,
Tom?

15:44.122 --> 15:47.581
Three hard-earned months,
which you could have ended badly.

15:47.759 --> 15:50.524
Special Agent G. Callen,
Special Agent Tom Panetti, Homeland.

15:50.695 --> 15:52.459
We were
on a joint task force together.

15:52.631 --> 15:54.065
Is he watching us?

15:56.635 --> 15:57.761
He is.

15:59.504 --> 16:00.767
What are you doing here?

16:00.939 --> 16:03.465
Your boy Faziz is connected
to a guy named Martin Lake.

16:03.642 --> 16:06.805
We have a dead intelligence officer
at a rehab center he owns

16:06.978 --> 16:08.537
with scopolamine in his body.

16:08.713 --> 16:10.875
Faziz made a loan to Lake recently.

16:11.483 --> 16:14.214
All right.
I'll check it out and get back.

16:14.386 --> 16:18.380
Play you off to Faziz as muscle
for a guy he's having problems with.

16:18.556 --> 16:22.390
In the meantime, do me a favor
and stay the hell away.

16:23.194 --> 16:25.891
Appreciate it, Tom.
Lucky you spotted me.

16:26.364 --> 16:28.059
Luck had nothing to do with it.

16:28.233 --> 16:31.225
All I saw was someone who
wouldn't be buying one of these cars.

16:31.736 --> 16:33.170
See what I'm saying?

16:33.338 --> 16:35.102
Wasn't talking about him.

16:41.913 --> 16:43.312
Goes without question, huh?

16:43.481 --> 16:46.075
- Shut up.
- Ha-ha-ha.

16:59.197 --> 17:00.494
Forty grams of sugar.

17:00.665 --> 17:02.497
Congratulations, you're sober.

17:02.901 --> 17:05.369
Now you have blood sugar-induced
depressive episodes.

17:06.204 --> 17:07.797
What else you got?

17:07.972 --> 17:09.440
Oh, look at that.

17:09.607 --> 17:11.165
Coronary in a can.

17:11.343 --> 17:13.209
Are you related to Gordon Ramsay?

17:13.377 --> 17:15.243
You might be the cook,

17:15.413 --> 17:17.608
but I'm here to ensure
what you put on people's plates

17:17.781 --> 17:20.222
meets nutritional requirements
that promote healthy lifestyle.

17:20.352 --> 17:21.786
- Understand that?
- Where's Bonnie?

17:21.953 --> 17:24.285
Because she never had a problem
with anything.

17:24.455 --> 17:26.550
Bonnie is dealing with some issues,

17:26.724 --> 17:29.023
mainly high blood pressure,
elevated cholesterol,

17:29.194 --> 17:31.561
and, oh,
off-the-charts triglyceride levels.

17:35.133 --> 17:37.101
- Hi, chef.
- Hey, Peggy.

17:37.736 --> 17:38.965
See?

17:39.137 --> 17:42.300
It's nice to see someone making
healthy food choices around here.

17:42.474 --> 17:44.465
She's the only one
who eats the damn things.

17:46.111 --> 17:50.241
You'll have individual therapy at 11,
followed by acupressure or Reiki,

17:50.415 --> 17:53.009
depending
on your counselor's assessment.

17:53.184 --> 17:55.812
Great.
Uh, the brochure said we get to surf.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.284
So do we get to surf?

17:57.455 --> 17:59.924
Well, times vary
for elective activities.

18:00.091 --> 18:03.186
After lunch, there will be
trauma regression with EMDR,

18:03.361 --> 18:05.056
equine or aqua therapy,

18:05.230 --> 18:08.393
and then you have either yoga
or meditation before dinner.

18:08.566 --> 18:10.694
Oh, some Fierce Yoga, that's, uh...

18:10.869 --> 18:11.995
That's awesome.

18:12.170 --> 18:14.969
We don't usually recommend that
for those still going through detox.

18:15.140 --> 18:18.599
It's stressful. But we might be able
to make an exception in your case

18:18.777 --> 18:21.097
because you won't be going
through any physical withdrawal.

18:21.246 --> 18:24.409
No. Yeah, no, right, of course.
The... Ahem, yeah.

18:25.083 --> 18:26.843
I know you may be feeling out of place,
dear,

18:26.985 --> 18:30.888
but let me assure you,
sex addiction is real.

18:35.260 --> 18:36.785
What's up?

18:38.730 --> 18:39.891
So I thought about it,

18:40.064 --> 18:42.863
and having a rose tattoo
does not make you Bambi.

18:44.035 --> 18:45.935
Well, you know what roses have.

18:46.438 --> 18:48.065
- Thorns?
- Yup.

18:49.641 --> 18:51.837
First Guns N' Roses
and now Poison.

18:52.010 --> 18:54.274
I heard Kensi and Deeks talking
about Jermaine Stewart,

18:54.446 --> 18:57.416
- so I thought it was '80s week.
- Heh.

18:57.749 --> 19:01.242
This would have been a lot harder
to pull off in the '80s with videotapes.

19:02.754 --> 19:04.518
Okay. So the digital time code

19:04.689 --> 19:07.317
of the Tranquility Villa front gate
was altered.

19:07.492 --> 19:08.789
Which got me thinking,

19:08.960 --> 19:11.156
what other footage
might have been altered?

19:11.663 --> 19:13.256
Okay, the time code on this claims

19:13.431 --> 19:15.351
that it's from outside Leonida's room
last night.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.696
Let me guess. It's not.

19:17.869 --> 19:20.229
And if there was anything incriminating
on the real footage,

19:20.371 --> 19:21.600
he would have trashed it.

19:21.773 --> 19:24.435
- He would think he trashed it.
- Hmm.

19:24.609 --> 19:26.270
Time to do some virtual
Dumpster diving.

19:26.444 --> 19:28.936
- Yep.
- Kensi, we need you

19:29.113 --> 19:31.013
to get Lake's computer online.

19:31.182 --> 19:33.412
Oh, you know what?
I can't work like this.

19:33.585 --> 19:34.814
Where is Mr. Lake's office?

19:35.453 --> 19:38.286
End of the hall.
Dream catcher on the door.

19:43.728 --> 19:45.253
I know it's just a simple form,

19:45.430 --> 19:50.027
but if you have any questions,
just feel free to ask about anything.

19:50.201 --> 19:54.934
As you can see, we take
our privacy policy very, very seriously.

19:55.707 --> 19:57.675
The only people who have...

20:16.261 --> 20:18.662
Okay, Eric, we're good to go.

20:19.964 --> 20:21.625
- Downloading.
- Okay.

20:21.799 --> 20:23.528
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

20:23.701 --> 20:25.032
Of course.

20:25.270 --> 20:28.331
Hi, Mr. Lake,
I'm the fill-in nutritionist.

20:28.506 --> 20:30.372
I know who you are.
What are you doing?

20:30.542 --> 20:32.302
Oh, I'm just sending an e-mail
to our office.

20:32.443 --> 20:34.571
They require daily inventory reports.

20:34.746 --> 20:36.214
Why are you using my computer?

20:36.381 --> 20:38.713
Oh, Bonnie said it would be okay.

20:39.183 --> 20:41.413
Well, it's not okay.
I have private files on there.

20:41.586 --> 20:42.951
Just a few more seconds.

20:43.121 --> 20:46.161
I'm not trying to look at your files,
Mr. Lake, I was just sending my report.

20:46.324 --> 20:49.316
You know what? Actually, um,
it's good that I bumped into you

20:49.494 --> 20:52.828
because, uh, we have some
serious issues with the cook.

20:52.997 --> 20:54.197
Marcos is a great guy and all,

20:54.365 --> 20:57.085
but, um, I've seen healthier pantries
on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.

20:57.235 --> 20:59.135
- Yeah.
- Yeah, not the best example

20:59.304 --> 21:00.772
we wanna be setting, is it?

21:01.606 --> 21:04.098
Well, I don't care what Bonnie said.
It isn't okay.

21:04.275 --> 21:06.403
Please, stay the hell out of my office.

21:06.911 --> 21:08.310
Got it.

21:09.581 --> 21:12.312
Of course. I'm sorry.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.713
Excuse me.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.457
What do we know, Hetty?

21:23.628 --> 21:25.289
I informed SECNAV

21:25.463 --> 21:29.161
that, uh, Mr. Leonida's death
is highly suspicious.

21:29.334 --> 21:31.268
I hope that helps
with the need-to-know.

21:31.436 --> 21:32.870
Indeed it does.

21:33.037 --> 21:36.337
Unfortunately, it brings up
more questions than answers.

21:36.507 --> 21:40.637
Mr. Leonida
was a high-level IT security officer.

21:41.079 --> 21:42.843
- How high?
- Privy to intel

21:43.014 --> 21:44.914
that would allow hackers access
to anything

21:45.083 --> 21:47.609
from troop movements
and base security details

21:47.785 --> 21:50.584
to locations and schedules
for diplomatic visits.

21:50.755 --> 21:52.621
Hmm. You hear anything
from Panetti's people?

21:52.790 --> 21:53.985
Homeland got back.

21:54.158 --> 21:56.126
Martin Lake
is not involved with Faziz.

21:56.294 --> 21:57.557
What about the loan?

21:57.729 --> 21:59.458
Gratitude for helping his son.

21:59.631 --> 22:01.759
If Lake's not working with Faziz,
who is?

22:01.933 --> 22:04.800
Well, we may have someone
who can help with that.

22:04.969 --> 22:08.405
I pulled this from Lake's hard drive.
He thought he trashed it.

22:08.573 --> 22:11.008
It's from the security camera
in the upstairs hallway

22:11.175 --> 22:14.167
of the Tranquility Villa
the night Gary Leonida died.

22:16.714 --> 22:17.840
Room 5.

22:18.016 --> 22:19.347
It's Gary Leonida's.

22:19.517 --> 22:22.748
One hour
before the coroner's time of death.

22:24.422 --> 22:27.551
Mr. Deeks needs to find
this young lady.

22:45.275 --> 22:46.538
Hey.

22:47.177 --> 22:50.613
- Hey.
- I saw your shirt, Fierce Yoga.

22:50.780 --> 22:52.700
I spend a lot of time
down at the one on Olympic.

22:53.316 --> 22:54.943
My clothes were trashed
when I got here.

22:55.118 --> 22:56.882
A counselor gave me the shirt.

22:57.053 --> 22:58.452
I actually hate yoga.

23:00.056 --> 23:02.684
Wow, that's... Heh. That's hilarious.

23:02.859 --> 23:05.179
Well, if we're being honest,
I don't really like it either.

23:05.328 --> 23:07.854
I just go down there to...

23:08.565 --> 23:10.033
I go down there to pick up women.

23:10.200 --> 23:13.864
- The sex-addiction thing.
- Yeah, the sex-addiction thing.

23:14.037 --> 23:16.199
- What's that like?
- Um...

23:16.773 --> 23:19.105
You know,
everybody thinks it's a joke.

23:19.709 --> 23:21.541
And sadly, it's not.

23:22.212 --> 23:24.732
Everybody thinks I'm off partying
with hot chicks, but really...

23:24.848 --> 23:28.614
It's just me cruising the nasty parts
of Hollywood late at night

23:28.785 --> 23:30.480
just looking for a fix.

23:30.920 --> 23:33.184
I mean, like, any fix.

23:33.823 --> 23:38.226
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- No, no. That's why we're here, right?

23:39.629 --> 23:42.621
It's interesting too, because I didn't
even think that I had an addiction.

23:43.066 --> 23:46.434
One of my friends invited me
to an open AA meeting.

23:46.603 --> 23:49.300
I'm sitting there
listening to this girl share.

23:49.472 --> 23:50.701
And she's obviously...

23:50.874 --> 23:55.539
You know, she's talking about drugs,
but our stories are the same.

23:56.246 --> 23:59.944
And she was headed here
and so, you know,

24:00.550 --> 24:01.745
here I am.

24:02.619 --> 24:04.747
Two addicts relating to another.

24:04.921 --> 24:07.447
And now you're in rehab together.

24:07.624 --> 24:08.682
No coincidences.

24:10.460 --> 24:12.622
It's crazy too, because I really wanted
to talk to her.

24:12.795 --> 24:14.991
I haven't seen her anywhere,
though.

24:15.165 --> 24:16.758
What's her name?

24:17.233 --> 24:20.066
That's... That's a damn good question.
I don't actually know her name.

24:20.236 --> 24:22.728
She just...
She was blond with these purple...

24:22.906 --> 24:24.431
Purple streaks in her hair.

24:24.607 --> 24:26.302
- Heather.
- Heather.

24:26.476 --> 24:28.171
She went AWOL last night.

24:28.344 --> 24:30.779
She went AWOL last night.

24:31.047 --> 24:32.640
You have any idea where she went?

24:33.116 --> 24:34.140
No idea.

24:34.317 --> 24:36.547
But all she ever talked about
was the Strip.

24:36.719 --> 24:37.982
Strip. That's her scene, huh?

24:38.154 --> 24:39.794
She liked partying it up
with celebutantes

24:39.923 --> 24:41.948
on her trust-fund credit card.

24:42.125 --> 24:46.460
Probably holed up at the St. James
or the Standard with an eight ball.

24:46.829 --> 24:48.490
More like the Chateau.

24:49.165 --> 24:51.327
Said she was the queen
of that place.

24:51.501 --> 24:53.333
Queen of the Chateau.

24:56.206 --> 24:58.004
Listen, I don't, uh...

24:58.675 --> 25:01.940
I don't know you at all. I don't know
what's going on with your life,

25:03.246 --> 25:06.511
but you seem like a pretty fantastic
person and I'm glad you're getting help.

25:08.418 --> 25:09.908
Thank you.

25:10.653 --> 25:11.984
Yeah.

25:16.626 --> 25:18.060
Her name is Heather Williams.

25:18.228 --> 25:20.253
If she checked in,
it's not under her name.

25:20.430 --> 25:21.522
What about her car?

25:21.698 --> 25:23.996
Uh, white Beamer, 3 series,

25:24.167 --> 25:27.899
vanity plate, "one like to party.”

25:29.372 --> 25:31.431
One like to party.

25:37.614 --> 25:38.911
Room number.

25:47.924 --> 25:49.619
- Federal agents!
- Federal agents!

26:06.709 --> 26:08.074
Go.

27:04.367 --> 27:06.529
- Hey!
- What is going on?

27:31.060 --> 27:32.323
Get off me!

27:43.239 --> 27:46.300
Help! Please! Help me!

27:47.877 --> 27:50.369
I'm a federal agent. Take my hand.

27:50.546 --> 27:52.913
Heather, take my hand.

27:53.082 --> 27:54.516
Come on. You got it.

27:56.519 --> 27:57.816
Come on. Unh!

27:57.987 --> 27:59.182
I got you.

28:00.156 --> 28:01.180
Come on.

28:07.296 --> 28:11.529
My room was down the hall
from Gary Leonida's at the rehab.

28:11.701 --> 28:14.500
That night,
I was headed for the kitchen

28:14.871 --> 28:17.203
when Gary's door opened
and Phil came out.

28:17.373 --> 28:19.398
You recognized him?

28:20.810 --> 28:22.278
He's the new meditation teacher.

28:22.445 --> 28:24.777
He had just come in for that day.

28:25.348 --> 28:26.747
Did you see Gary?

28:28.418 --> 28:29.852
He was loaded.

28:30.019 --> 28:32.078
There was a bottle of pills
on the table.

28:32.922 --> 28:35.687
The way Phil was looking at me...

28:37.193 --> 28:40.720
I've seen enough drug deals
to know that this dude was trouble.

28:41.564 --> 28:43.464
Was there anybody else
in the room?

28:43.633 --> 28:45.397
I don't think so.

28:45.568 --> 28:48.094
When he came after me,
I just bolted.

28:48.271 --> 28:49.466
I ran down to PCH.

28:49.639 --> 28:52.233
I hitched a ride to my house
and got my car.

28:52.408 --> 28:53.933
You went to the Chateau.

28:54.110 --> 28:58.308
I didn't know what was happening,
but I knew it wasn't good.

28:58.481 --> 29:01.348
I figured he might know
where I lived.

29:02.151 --> 29:05.018
I called one of my connections

29:05.822 --> 29:08.257
and I actually hung up
before he answered.

29:09.992 --> 29:12.256
Can you believe that?

29:12.428 --> 29:14.954
I really was trying to get clean
this time.

29:16.732 --> 29:19.895
You are getting clean. You hung up.

29:21.204 --> 29:23.969
You just got through one of the most
stressful periods of your life

29:24.140 --> 29:25.835
without using.

29:27.276 --> 29:28.744
That's huge.

29:29.212 --> 29:32.648
- Then why do I feel so shaky?
- Because you're new to this.

29:32.815 --> 29:34.146
And that is why you need help.

29:34.684 --> 29:36.982
No way. I'm not going back there.

29:37.153 --> 29:38.985
I wouldn't suggest you do.

29:39.322 --> 29:41.882
But there are many other places.

29:42.758 --> 29:44.783
We know people
who can help you find them.

29:50.900 --> 29:52.425
Okay.

29:54.270 --> 29:57.501
This is Phil, our meditation teacher.

29:57.673 --> 29:58.936
Real name, Robert Hayes.

29:59.108 --> 30:00.940
Part-time lecturer
at Sherman Oaks College.

30:01.110 --> 30:03.010
Advanced degree
in computer science.

30:03.179 --> 30:04.442
House in West L.A.

30:04.614 --> 30:07.515
Arrests for unlawful assembly
and resisting arrest,

30:07.683 --> 30:09.378
mostly at sit-ins
and demonstrations.

30:09.886 --> 30:11.047
He's political.

30:11.220 --> 30:13.552
Hayes is a member
of the Homeland Defense League,

30:13.723 --> 30:15.657
an ultra-right-wing extremist group.

30:15.825 --> 30:18.294
Their manifesto states
that nation building

30:18.461 --> 30:22.159
is not only a waste of time,
but a criminal act akin to treason.

30:22.331 --> 30:23.992
"That all of Pakistan
and Afghanistan

30:24.166 --> 30:26.100
should be removed
from the face of the earth"?

30:26.269 --> 30:28.863
"Their so-called civilians
be damned.”

30:29.038 --> 30:31.666
They believe no one in those countries
is innocent.

30:31.841 --> 30:33.741
- Sound familiar?
- Yeah.

30:33.910 --> 30:37.869
Same reasoning al Qaeda uses
to justify attacking civilian targets.

30:38.047 --> 30:40.812
So now we know what he wants,
the question is, how is he gonna do it?

30:40.983 --> 30:42.815
Well, the intel he got
from Gary Leonida

30:42.985 --> 30:44.077
has gotta be connected.

30:44.253 --> 30:46.534
Important enough to make sure
Heather didn't connect Hayes

30:46.689 --> 30:48.282
with Leonida.

30:48.524 --> 30:51.653
I think it's time
we pay Mr. Hayes a friendly visit.

30:53.429 --> 30:54.521
Federal agent!

30:57.833 --> 30:59.198
Clear.

31:03.239 --> 31:05.207
- Clear.
- Sam.

31:31.634 --> 31:35.264
Eric, I'm online
on Robert Hayes' computer.

31:36.005 --> 31:37.029
I see it.

31:39.075 --> 31:40.543
Pakistani tribal region.

31:40.710 --> 31:43.611
Something tells me they're not looking
for places to send Ramadan cards.

31:46.515 --> 31:48.415
Unless they attach it to one of these.

31:51.454 --> 31:53.218
This is not good.

31:53.389 --> 31:54.948
How not good is "not good"?

31:55.124 --> 31:56.717
Very, very not good.

31:56.892 --> 31:59.657
It looks like Hayes
used the intel Gary Leonida gave him

31:59.829 --> 32:02.958
to gain control of a U.S.
Predator drone over Afghanistan.

32:17.946 --> 32:19.209
While a drone is in flight,

32:19.380 --> 32:22.111
it sends back continuous information
on an encrypted frequency

32:22.283 --> 32:23.614
to the person controlling it.

32:23.785 --> 32:25.412
That includes GPS coordinates

32:25.587 --> 32:27.885
that the drone acquires
from several satellites.

32:28.056 --> 32:31.287
If a hacker has the encryption code,
he gets into the brain of the drone

32:31.459 --> 32:35.054
and sends a false GPS signal
back to the ground. It's called spoofing.

32:35.230 --> 32:37.824
So the operator thinks
he's sending the drone one place

32:37.999 --> 32:40.866
when in fact the hacker is sending it
wherever he wants it to go.

32:41.035 --> 32:43.663
Or they can launch its missiles
on an unsuspecting target.

32:44.172 --> 32:46.834
Now, it's not fail-safe.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.737
The drone has a camera onboard.

32:48.910 --> 32:50.378
And so if the operator's alert

32:50.545 --> 32:52.274
and the terrain begins
to look suspicious,

32:52.447 --> 32:54.711
he'll realize the drone isn't going
where it should be.

32:54.883 --> 32:57.079
- Any way to override it?
- Unfortunately, no.

32:57.252 --> 32:58.777
Drone has to be physically taken out

32:58.953 --> 33:01.753
and we have no way of knowing which
one they'll even attempt to access.

33:01.923 --> 33:04.243
Not to mention which target
they'll launch its missiles on.

33:04.392 --> 33:05.712
We gotta ground all these drones.

33:05.860 --> 33:07.828
Easier said than done, Mr. Deeks.

33:07.996 --> 33:10.658
There are dozens of UAV's
in the region,

33:10.832 --> 33:14.063
all under various commands
within the Navy alone.

33:14.235 --> 33:15.930
Even if they agree to ground them,

33:16.104 --> 33:18.937
which, given our current lack
of verification, is doubtful,

33:19.107 --> 33:20.302
it could take hours.

33:20.475 --> 33:21.874
We've gotta find Hayes.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.011
Indeed, Mr. Callen.
The sooner the better.

33:24.545 --> 33:25.585
This could be a long shot,

33:25.747 --> 33:28.011
but there's something
in his browsing history he deleted.

33:28.182 --> 33:29.741
Well, that he thought he deleted.

33:29.918 --> 33:32.785
A couple of hours ago, Hayes
did a search for motels in Hollywood.

33:32.954 --> 33:36.754
But he only accessed one site, um,
the Holiday Lodge on 3rd.

34:23.638 --> 34:25.197
Moving.

34:47.195 --> 34:49.458
I got a rear window.
Probably a bathroom.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.599
Whenever you get the urge, Deeks.

35:05.213 --> 35:07.147
Better if we could have
taken Hayes alive.

35:07.315 --> 35:09.395
Chances are,
he's not the only extremist in the group

35:09.550 --> 35:11.110
willing to take this to the next level.

35:11.252 --> 35:12.515
Key word is "extremist."

35:12.687 --> 35:15.713
They don't usually just put their hands
in the air and surrender.

35:15.890 --> 35:18.723
- He had a laptop open.
- If we were a few minutes later.

35:18.893 --> 35:21.123
- But we weren't.
- Problem, Callen.

35:21.295 --> 35:22.319
Talk to me, Eric.

35:22.730 --> 35:24.220
Someone just spoofed
a Predator drone

35:24.399 --> 35:26.629
over the Baluchistan province
of Afghanistan.

35:26.801 --> 35:29.065
They have lost complete control
of it.

35:29.737 --> 35:30.863
This is a setup.

35:31.039 --> 35:33.159
- Hayes had someone else.
- Or someone else had Hayes.

35:33.307 --> 35:35.799
Offered him up as a sacrificial lamb
to divert us.

35:35.977 --> 35:37.809
- What's the target?
- Their guess

35:37.979 --> 35:41.142
is a small village
just across the Pakistani border.

35:41.549 --> 35:43.347
Pakistan, that's a political nightmare.

35:43.518 --> 35:45.350
It gets worse.

35:45.520 --> 35:48.421
The village is the childhood home
of the Pakistani ambassador

35:48.589 --> 35:49.647
to the United States.

35:50.124 --> 35:51.751
Is SECNAV scrambling jets?

35:51.926 --> 35:52.950
She already has,

35:53.127 --> 35:55.653
but there's no guarantee
they'll get there on time.

35:55.830 --> 35:57.195
ETA to strike range?

35:57.365 --> 35:58.992
About 90 minutes.

35:59.167 --> 36:01.226
- Is that enough time to evacuate?
- Maybe.

36:01.402 --> 36:04.861
But doing so would require us
to admit to the Pakistanis

36:05.039 --> 36:08.304
that we have a rogue drone
in their airspace.

36:08.476 --> 36:09.841
We have gone over every byte

36:10.011 --> 36:13.242
on Hayes' home PC and laptop.
Other than his two dead associates,

36:13.414 --> 36:15.508
there is no evidence
of a co-conspirator.

36:15.683 --> 36:17.674
No. There has to be a connection
to someone.

36:17.852 --> 36:19.843
If it's not on the computers...

36:20.021 --> 36:21.511
Then it's gotta be at his home.

36:34.335 --> 36:38.135
Callen, the drone just crossed over
to Pakistani airspace.

36:52.019 --> 36:53.819
"She's the only one
who eats the damn things."

36:54.722 --> 36:56.121
What?

37:13.107 --> 37:15.508
- Put your hands in the air!
- Back away from the desk.

37:19.747 --> 37:21.078
Hands behind your back.

37:35.763 --> 37:37.288
If we'd been
a couple seconds later...

37:37.999 --> 37:41.458
- But we weren't.
- By the way, I'm not a nutritionist.

37:41.636 --> 37:44.503
Nope.
And I don't have a problem with sex.

37:56.918 --> 37:58.147
Peggy did all the intakes.

37:58.319 --> 38:00.981
She knew Leonidas background
on naval intelligence.

38:01.155 --> 38:02.987
She also coordinated
all the per diem workers

38:03.157 --> 38:05.819
and arranged for Hayes
to come in as the meditation teacher.

38:05.993 --> 38:08.155
And altered
the security footage time code.

38:08.329 --> 38:11.026
Homeland Defense League
was all over her laptop history.

38:11.199 --> 38:12.223
Once we had Heather,

38:12.400 --> 38:15.563
Peggy knew it was just a matter
of time before we were onto Hayes.

38:15.736 --> 38:17.670
She set him up,
knew what motel he was at,

38:17.838 --> 38:19.465
and put it in his browsing history.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.836
But at the end,
a nutrition bar wrapper blew her cover.

38:22.009 --> 38:23.101
No. No, no.

38:23.277 --> 38:26.247
- Kensilina blew her cover.
- Thank you.

38:26.981 --> 38:29.746
So, what's up?
You wanna get a beer, talk tattoos?

38:30.484 --> 38:32.009
You know what?

38:33.020 --> 38:35.250
I'm over the tat thing.

38:35.990 --> 38:37.219
Good.

38:37.391 --> 38:39.951
Talk to me about body piercing.

38:44.498 --> 38:48.594
- Hey, uh, are you...? Are you hungry?
- Oh, yeah. What do you feel like?

38:49.337 --> 38:50.668
Uh, I don't know.

38:50.838 --> 38:53.603
I was thinking, you know,
something like tacos maybe.

38:53.774 --> 38:55.071
Perfect.

38:56.477 --> 38:57.501
Perfect.

39:09.991 --> 39:11.584
What's wrong?

39:14.262 --> 39:17.357
This is not exactly
"something like tacos.”

39:18.266 --> 39:20.826
What are you talking about?
This is Nouveau southwestern cuisine

39:21.002 --> 39:22.436
with a little French flair.

39:22.603 --> 39:26.164
You know, it may not be tacos exactly,
but it has its origins in tacos.

39:26.340 --> 39:28.502
Like a Croque-Monsieur
has its origins in ham.

39:28.676 --> 39:30.940
You know what I'm talking about.

39:32.113 --> 39:35.174
- This is nice. Really nice.
- I know.

39:35.349 --> 39:37.249
I was thinking
about stealing the plates.

39:37.418 --> 39:38.647
Deeks.

39:40.254 --> 39:42.086
Okay.
And that's a problem because...?

39:42.256 --> 39:44.520
Because once again
you're trying to say something

39:44.692 --> 39:45.955
without actually saying it.

39:46.394 --> 39:48.726
And it's driving me nuts.

39:49.363 --> 39:50.660
- I think you lost me.
- No.

39:51.132 --> 39:52.258
I don't think I did.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.697
I think you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

39:54.869 --> 39:56.394
- Do I?
- Damn it, Deeks.

39:57.338 --> 40:00.603
You asked me out on a date without
actually asking me out on a date.

40:02.443 --> 40:05.208
Now, if this keeps going this way
and we can't communicate...

40:05.379 --> 40:07.848
And we've been over this,
you never say what you mean.

40:08.015 --> 40:10.677
If this is the way it's gonna be,
I don't know how we're...

40:10.851 --> 40:12.478
I don't wanna be here with you
right now.

40:16.824 --> 40:17.950
What?
