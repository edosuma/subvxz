WEBVTT

00:01.093 --> 00:04.006
- Previously on Good Witch
- I'm going to look

00:04.049 --> 00:05.649
- at a lake house.
- For what?

00:05.717 --> 00:07.584
He's planning something behind my back.

00:07.620 --> 00:10.054
- Your 30th anniversary.
- I don't know how I can do

00:10.089 --> 00:12.924
that job and spend any time with Nick.
Let alone keep my practice.

00:12.959 --> 00:15.631
- You look like you've seen a ghost.
- I think I did.

00:22.465 --> 00:25.636
I had no idea this part
of the park even existed.

00:25.705 --> 00:27.772
Well, I am an archeologist;

00:27.840 --> 00:29.493
it is my job to unearth things.

00:30.227 --> 00:31.966
I thought we were going on a hike.

00:32.628 --> 00:35.997
- Oh, we are! Right after we...
- Jump off a cliff?

00:38.287 --> 00:40.901
- Yeah.
- I'm surprised.

00:41.295 --> 00:44.172
- You are?
- At how much I want to do this.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.741
Hell, for me, Middleton
has been one big surprise.

00:46.809 --> 00:48.909
I never thought I'd like
teaching as much I do.

00:48.978 --> 00:51.178
- Yeah, I knew you would.
- You were always

00:51.247 --> 00:53.748
leading, even when
you weren't in charge.

00:53.816 --> 00:57.251
So, uh... teachers lead.

00:57.286 --> 00:59.598
Ah, ladies first.

01:03.593 --> 01:05.000
Alright.

01:06.896 --> 01:09.263
Oh yeah, Cassie!

01:09.298 --> 01:10.978
Here we go!

01:12.736 --> 01:14.468
Wooh!

01:32.711 --> 01:33.788
Wooh!

01:34.647 --> 01:36.290
Ha ha ha!

01:36.695 --> 01:38.026
It's funny...

01:39.028 --> 01:40.663
I think I was meant to come here.

01:41.864 --> 01:43.904
Fate plays a role in everything, huh?

01:45.704 --> 01:48.136
I think in a way, my moving
here lead me to the Maldives.

01:48.171 --> 01:49.407
I mean, being in the field,

01:50.073 --> 01:52.106
I never had time to apply
for a grant of my own.

01:52.684 --> 01:54.608
- Fate.
- Yeah, or luck.

01:54.644 --> 01:56.206
- Or both.
- Heh!

01:56.712 --> 01:59.947
Although, if I don't
find a field supervisor

01:59.982 --> 02:02.249
by the end of the week,
it's all gonna go away.

02:02.285 --> 02:05.519
The grant is conditional on
my ability to staff the dig.

02:05.555 --> 02:08.622
Ah. Well, there's someone out there.

02:08.657 --> 02:10.253
Oh, I have two choices, but...

02:10.827 --> 02:12.693
I just don't have a strong
feeling about either one.

02:13.264 --> 02:15.097
Hm... Time to clear your head?

02:15.131 --> 02:17.898
You know me so well.

02:17.934 --> 02:20.734
- Camping?
- Day after tomorrow.

02:21.135 --> 02:23.637
Figure a night under
the stars... Clear my head.

02:23.673 --> 02:26.474
You know, when I was
younger, I wanted to camp

02:26.509 --> 02:28.476
in every country on the map.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.813
- I've come pretty close.
- How about you?

02:32.715 --> 02:35.450
I never quite finished
my list before I moved here.

02:36.327 --> 02:37.852
It's not too late.

02:37.887 --> 02:39.247
Yeah...

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

03:08.050 --> 03:10.151
- Martha's on to you.
- What?

03:10.186 --> 03:12.553
- The party.
- What happened?

03:12.588 --> 03:15.556
It's not my fault. Greg is
proving to be quite a challenge.

03:15.625 --> 03:17.458
- Greg?
- I was trying to work out

03:17.493 --> 03:19.593
my next move in my head
and then, Martha walked in

03:19.662 --> 03:22.429
and I said something I shouldn't have.

03:22.465 --> 03:24.899
You like Greg enough
to be distracted by him?

03:24.934 --> 03:26.901
I like that he's good looking.

03:26.969 --> 03:28.903
Hm... This attraction

03:28.971 --> 03:31.872
that you feel, it isn't
only because he's not easily

03:31.941 --> 03:34.742
- surrendering to your charms?
- No.

03:34.810 --> 03:37.278
Well, we don't always get what we want.

03:37.346 --> 03:39.513
- I do.
- Hm! Well,

03:39.582 --> 03:41.522
I hope you want what you get.

03:42.285 --> 03:45.119
Don't worry about me,
I have Greg under control.

03:47.523 --> 03:49.823
Um, here comes trouble.

03:52.128 --> 03:55.429
- Hi, Martha!
- So...

03:55.498 --> 03:58.132
what's this I hear
about you hosting a party?

03:58.201 --> 04:00.134
Celebrating something, are we?

04:00.203 --> 04:03.938
I saw the flowers for the
party... lovely by the way;

04:03.973 --> 04:06.140
- all my favorites!
- They're not for you.

04:06.692 --> 04:08.443
- Who then?
- John.

04:09.665 --> 04:11.045
Who's John?

04:11.832 --> 04:13.315
Ah, Jo... Uh...

04:13.349 --> 04:15.716
He's a friend who's teaching
at the university this semester.

04:16.175 --> 04:17.584
You're throwing him a party?

04:17.653 --> 04:20.154
It's actually a romantic dinner for two.

04:20.189 --> 04:22.423
But please don't tell anyone.
Cassie wants to surprise John.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.725
Oh!! Well, of course!

04:24.794 --> 04:27.861
So it's a dinner. For John.

04:27.897 --> 04:29.504
It would seem that way. Hm!

04:29.999 --> 04:31.799
Well, then I shall say nothing.

04:31.834 --> 04:35.736
Except that I wish my husband
were as romantic as you are.

04:35.771 --> 04:37.805
I am sure Tom will find some
way to mark your anniversary.

04:37.873 --> 04:40.174
Aw, your faith in him is sweet,

04:40.209 --> 04:42.343
but completely misguided.

04:46.549 --> 04:49.216
Well, I think I put
that genie back in the bottle.

04:49.252 --> 04:50.894
You're welcome.

04:52.399 --> 04:54.119
Good night!

05:01.530 --> 05:04.031
- Everything was delicious.
- Oh, I'm just glad

05:04.066 --> 05:06.433
- you enjoyed it.
- You're quite the chef.

05:06.469 --> 05:09.169
- Don't you agree?
- Absolutely. But, I have to say

05:09.205 --> 05:12.106
that Donna is really quite
the talented chef as well.

05:12.695 --> 05:15.809
- Thank you, honey.
- Not as good as Bobby.

05:15.845 --> 05:17.647
- Bobby...
- Who's that?

05:18.080 --> 05:20.614
- Private chef.
- Private chef?

05:20.650 --> 05:22.516
- Jackson Hole.
- He came

05:22.551 --> 05:26.091
- with the house that we rented.
- Ever been heli-skiing?

05:26.126 --> 05:28.389
- No.
- It'll change your life.

05:28.424 --> 05:31.325
It was a real treat to come home
from a day of skiing and have

05:31.360 --> 05:33.795
- dinner waiting for you.
- Sounds amazing.

05:33.831 --> 05:36.030
- It was.
- Maybe next time we can all go.

05:36.065 --> 05:38.399
- Yeah.
- That sounds fun!

05:38.434 --> 05:40.501
Yeah.

05:44.874 --> 05:47.641
Ha!!

05:47.677 --> 05:51.312
Maybe you should join a team.

05:51.347 --> 05:53.414
Hey, I was hoping to get some help.

05:53.449 --> 05:55.849
With your lay-up or your jump shot?

05:55.885 --> 05:57.851
I have a guest

05:57.887 --> 06:00.854
- who is seeing apparitions.
- Ghosts?

06:00.890 --> 06:04.091
Yes. Look, he's about to check
out and I'm worried about him.

06:04.126 --> 06:05.759
You know I don't believe
in that kind of stuff.

06:05.795 --> 06:08.495
Spirits are just energy
in an alternate form.

06:08.531 --> 06:10.998
But I don't believe energy
comes back into human form.

06:11.067 --> 06:13.701
- Doesn't mean it can't happen.
- So you argue a negative.

06:13.769 --> 06:16.537
Yes. But I'm positive about it.

06:17.706 --> 06:19.007
Our conversations are never dull.

06:19.041 --> 06:21.675
No, there's no one
I like disagreeing with more.

06:22.391 --> 06:25.045
Well that sounds more
psychological than physical.

06:25.114 --> 06:26.914
But I could get him a referral.

06:27.542 --> 06:30.617
I have a feeling you're
the person he needs to see.

06:31.062 --> 06:33.355
Well, send your guest by my office

06:33.422 --> 06:35.823
I'll see what I can do.

06:35.891 --> 06:38.559
Oh! Ugh, it's my realtor.

06:38.627 --> 06:40.761
- Ooh, the lake house?
- Yeah. Unfortunately,

06:40.830 --> 06:42.357
I'm not the only one who wants it.

06:43.565 --> 06:45.032
I'm not sure I wanna
get in a bidding war.

06:45.101 --> 06:47.634
Well, before I commit to
anything, I like to look at it

06:47.703 --> 06:49.703
- from both sides.
- Both sides?

06:49.772 --> 06:52.306
- Yeah. There's pros and cons to everything.
-  That's true.

06:52.375 --> 06:55.209
- When the pros out- weigh the cons...
- You commit?

06:55.581 --> 06:58.413
If it's something I really want, yes.

07:04.141 --> 07:06.754
So, how's your London essay going?

07:06.789 --> 07:10.257
- I finished it.
- I thought you'd be happier.

07:11.109 --> 07:13.309
The more I find out,
the less happy I get.

07:13.629 --> 07:16.029
OK. Well, let's hope
that's not the opening sentence

07:16.098 --> 07:17.452
to your essay!

07:18.734 --> 07:21.655
- You don't have to go, Nick.
- I...

07:22.349 --> 07:23.670
Hi Cassie.

07:24.230 --> 07:25.473
- Okay.
- Hey!

07:25.508 --> 07:27.674
- Hi, Mom!
- Oh!

07:27.710 --> 07:30.477
- What?
- You've cinnamon on your nose.

07:31.297 --> 07:33.680
Nick! Not cool.

07:33.749 --> 07:35.665
I must have missed that.

07:36.552 --> 07:39.486
- I should go home, so...
- Aw...

07:39.522 --> 07:41.989
- Bye Cassie. Bye Grace.
- Bye Nick.

07:42.024 --> 07:43.538
Bye.

07:46.906 --> 07:48.028
I love cinnamon.

07:48.436 --> 07:51.032
Ever since you were
a baby. Cinnamaldehyde,

07:51.220 --> 07:53.468
the main ingredient in cinnamon
and has great health benefits.

07:53.502 --> 07:56.603
- And the sugar and butter?
- Oh... those just taste good.

07:59.221 --> 08:01.109
- You love baking.
- Yeah.

08:01.143 --> 08:03.577
I mean, I love doing it but...

08:04.142 --> 08:05.900
it's not like cooking or baking is...

08:06.988 --> 08:08.148
my thing.

08:08.934 --> 08:10.485
And you're looking for that thing?

08:10.519 --> 08:11.868
Yeah.

08:12.888 --> 08:16.790
I mean, I love school
and my internship but...

08:17.117 --> 08:20.528
- But you want something else.
- Did you ever feel like this, mom?

08:20.563 --> 08:24.364
- I was sixteen once too.
- So what did you do?

08:24.756 --> 08:27.334
Well, I discovered
a long time ago that focusing

08:27.369 --> 08:28.990
on other people's needs

08:29.789 --> 08:32.639
brought me joy and
made me feel complete.

08:33.897 --> 08:35.241
So, that is your thing.

08:35.277 --> 08:37.839
That's one of my things... yeah.

08:56.428 --> 08:57.165
Hey!

08:57.199 --> 08:58.755
Hey, where are you off to so early?

08:59.201 --> 09:01.468
I had a patient admitted
to the hospital last night,

09:01.537 --> 09:03.370
- so I wanted to check on her.
- Seems like there's one other

09:03.405 --> 09:06.807
person to see at the hospital.

09:06.842 --> 09:10.010
- Valerie is not giving up.
- And you?

09:10.045 --> 09:13.213
This Chief of Staff job is
just too big of a commitment.

09:13.249 --> 09:15.716
- I have to have time for Nick.
- Hm...

09:15.784 --> 09:17.885
What if the Hillcrest
job were different?

09:18.740 --> 09:19.754
It doesn't work that way.

09:21.099 --> 09:22.723
You'd have to turn
the job they're offering,

09:22.791 --> 09:26.039
- into the job you want.
- Jobs like that

09:26.064 --> 09:28.395
don't change for you,
you change for them.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.964
I would just end up bending to the job.

09:31.312 --> 09:34.067
- Hm. That's too bad!
- How so?

09:34.482 --> 09:36.236
Well, the whole community
would benefit from having you

09:36.305 --> 09:39.439
run the hospital. Look what
you've done for Middleton.

09:39.508 --> 09:42.543
You've had quite an impact,
made such a difference.

09:42.578 --> 09:44.511
I would like to help more people

09:44.580 --> 09:46.947
but I just don't know how. But thanks.

09:46.982 --> 09:49.249
- Sure.
- See ya.

10:06.802 --> 10:07.964
Mm...

10:09.368 --> 10:11.703
Mm! Mm-hm!

10:12.508 --> 10:14.541
Delicious.

10:14.610 --> 10:16.376
That's what you said
about the Orange Chiffon,

10:16.445 --> 10:18.712
the Mocha Praline and
the Triple Berry Cheesecake.

10:18.912 --> 10:21.215
- They can't all be delicious.
- I can't decide.

10:21.283 --> 10:22.187
They're all good.

10:23.252 --> 10:24.918
Hey, I talked to my friend, Walter.

10:24.987 --> 10:27.287
- Who's Walter?
- The friend looking to invest.

10:27.323 --> 10:29.289
- He wants to meet with you.
- How do you know him, again?

10:29.358 --> 10:31.291
We went to high school
together. But he's a broker

10:31.360 --> 10:34.928
- at the exchange in Chicago.
- I don't know...

10:35.871 --> 10:37.665
You could get a loan.

10:37.733 --> 10:39.766
I'm still paying down
the loan on the Bistro.

10:39.802 --> 10:42.069
- The bank isn't an option.
- Then meet with Walter.

10:42.104 --> 10:44.204
Come on. Help me help you get
your catering business going.

10:44.239 --> 10:47.808
Catering? Is someone catering
a party I don't know about?

10:47.876 --> 10:49.643
- Ah...
- No. Stephanie's

10:49.678 --> 10:52.045
been talking about
starting a catering business.

10:52.081 --> 10:55.415
- Oh.
- I gotta get back to work.

10:55.484 --> 10:57.918
- Thanks for the cake.
- Anytime!

10:57.953 --> 11:00.606
When I heard catering,
first, I thought...

11:00.956 --> 11:02.789
And then I thought, maybe
you were just talking about

11:02.858 --> 11:05.492
- Cassie's dinner party.
- Cassie?

11:05.527 --> 11:07.294
But of course that's just a
romantic dinner for two, so...

11:08.063 --> 11:09.696
Which I wasn't supposed to mention.

11:10.071 --> 11:11.633
Cassie's having a romantic dinner?

11:11.667 --> 11:13.800
- For John.
- The hunky archeologist?

11:13.836 --> 11:15.383
She told me herself!

11:16.518 --> 11:18.572
- Hey, John...
- Stephanie.

11:18.607 --> 11:22.075
So... I take it you're Cassie's John?

11:22.111 --> 11:25.446
- Mayor Martha Tinsdale.
- Nice to meet you.

11:25.482 --> 11:28.148
Hey, can I put in an early
lunch order for tomorrow.

11:28.183 --> 11:30.350
- Ah!
- Tomorrow.

11:30.386 --> 11:32.252
Yeah. I figure, why eat freeze
dried food while I'm camping

11:32.287 --> 11:35.188
when I can enjoy one
of Steph's lunch baskets, right?

11:35.224 --> 11:37.724
- You can't go away tomorrow.
- Why?

11:38.723 --> 11:40.427
Cassie's planning a surprise for you.

11:41.131 --> 11:43.397
- Like a party?
- Not really a party,

11:43.465 --> 11:46.900
more like a dinner. Stephanie
shouldn't have told you.

11:46.935 --> 11:48.735
But Cassie knows I'm
headed out of town tomorrow.

11:48.771 --> 11:51.171
- She does?
- Yeah, I told her yesterday.

11:51.206 --> 11:54.241
Then, how can she be planning
a surprise dinner for you?

11:55.412 --> 11:57.144
That's a good question!

12:10.718 --> 12:11.906
Hi there.

12:11.975 --> 12:15.076
- Hi! You saved me a trip.
- Did I?

12:15.112 --> 12:17.279
- I was heading to your office.
- I've spoken with the powers

12:17.348 --> 12:19.481
that be and they are ready
to make an official offer.

12:19.550 --> 12:21.950
- I'm listening.
- Great.

12:21.986 --> 12:24.420
So, just tell me what
it will take to close the deal.

12:25.558 --> 12:27.188
I need...

12:28.710 --> 12:29.991
complete autonomy

12:30.061 --> 12:32.594
over my schedule to take care
of my practice and my son.

12:32.663 --> 12:35.030
You know you'll be responsible

12:35.099 --> 12:37.933
for directing and operating
the entire hospital,

12:37.968 --> 12:40.969
supervising the medical staff,
funding, clinical trials;

12:41.038 --> 12:44.773
- that's a full-time job.
- I can't give you all my time.

12:46.644 --> 12:48.444
You don't make this easy, do you?

12:49.677 --> 12:52.947
Having time for
my family and my practice,

12:52.983 --> 12:54.767
those are non-negotiable.

12:55.286 --> 12:58.854
- Well, I know you're worth it.
- But..?

12:59.741 --> 13:01.890
I don't know if I can
sell that to the board.

13:07.164 --> 13:08.824
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi!

13:08.893 --> 13:11.600
- Pumpkin spiced chai.
- Thank you.

13:11.635 --> 13:13.736
I had a feeling
you could use a pick-me-up.

13:13.804 --> 13:16.338
- Your feeling was right.
- Something tells me

13:16.407 --> 13:18.640
that you could use a pick-me-up as well.

13:18.709 --> 13:21.009
I'm just trying to figure out
a way to take your advice.

13:21.078 --> 13:23.712
- Oh! To help someone?
- Yes.

13:23.781 --> 13:26.548
Hm... Well, the act of
reaching out is a good start.

13:26.584 --> 13:29.084
Every beginning has to start somewhere.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.053
Oh. Cheers... Oh!

13:31.088 --> 13:33.455
No, no, no! This is
my... my favourite shirt.

13:33.491 --> 13:36.091
You know, we should get
that stain out before it sets.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.878
I can't. I have school in 20 minutes.

13:38.362 --> 13:40.318
Here.

13:44.502 --> 13:46.230
I got a bunch of
these vintage tees in in.

13:47.246 --> 13:49.941
I love it. Thanks.

13:49.976 --> 13:51.012
Sure.

13:54.270 --> 13:56.852
- I'm not speaking to you.
- But you are.

13:57.314 --> 14:00.082
- Just to tell you that I'm not.
- Stephanie...

14:00.117 --> 14:01.984
How is it that I didn't know

14:02.019 --> 14:05.020
- when I called it from the start?
- What are you talking about?

14:05.891 --> 14:07.455
You're throwing
a romantic dinner for John

14:07.491 --> 14:10.092
and I have to hear about it
from Martha? And what about

14:10.127 --> 14:12.961
Martha's party? It's a big
event. I need you there.

14:12.997 --> 14:14.963
You can't just sneak off with John!

14:14.999 --> 14:16.927
No, I'm not having dinner
with John. Abigail slipped,

14:16.963 --> 14:19.134
Martha almost found out
about her party...

14:19.170 --> 14:21.109
Oh... it's a cover.

14:21.243 --> 14:24.611
- Makes sense. I forgive you.
- Oh, thanks!

14:24.646 --> 14:27.376
- Does John know it's a cover?
- He doesn't know about any

14:28.233 --> 14:29.677
of this. John knows about this?

14:29.713 --> 14:31.847
On the bright side...

14:31.882 --> 14:34.316
- There's a bright side?
- Abigail messed up, not me.

14:34.351 --> 14:37.553
I told you I could
keep a secret and I did.

14:37.621 --> 14:39.855
But you told John about the dinner.

14:39.890 --> 14:41.890
Yeah. But that's not
a real thing; the dinner.

14:41.926 --> 14:45.194
- So it doesn't count.
- You didn't know that at the time.

14:45.229 --> 14:47.830
OK, let's not confuse me
with the details and facts.

14:47.865 --> 14:51.934
OK. Anyway, Ben was in,
working on my shelf...

14:51.969 --> 14:54.203
And he told you
about the catering business?

14:54.238 --> 14:56.205
- Uh-huh!
- He knows someone

14:56.240 --> 14:58.006
who may be interested in investing.

14:58.735 --> 15:00.175
But you're not sold on the idea.

15:00.211 --> 15:01.511
I'm not.

15:03.547 --> 15:05.347
Would you mind taking this
to Abigail? She wants to sell

15:05.416 --> 15:07.916
my candles in her store, and
my shop is too busy to leave.

15:07.952 --> 15:10.252
Sure, it's on my way back to the Bistro.

15:10.321 --> 15:12.454
That's one path I know my way to.

15:16.861 --> 15:18.212
What do you think?

15:19.230 --> 15:20.523
Perfect.

15:31.876 --> 15:35.577
I got a text about a flower
arrangement to pick up, but...

15:35.646 --> 15:39.281
- I didn't order anything.
- You didn't?

15:40.092 --> 15:42.150
Well, now that you're here,
maybe you'd like to tell me

15:42.219 --> 15:43.609
what your problem is?

15:44.081 --> 15:45.348
I have a problem?

15:46.524 --> 15:48.557
Well, we don't have a second date.

15:48.592 --> 15:51.960
- And that's a problem?
- For you it is.

15:52.029 --> 15:54.663
- But not for you?
- I can go off and get

15:54.732 --> 15:57.199
- a second date with anybody.
- So could I.

15:57.268 --> 15:59.268
But your second date
wouldn't include me,

15:59.336 --> 16:01.071
and that would be a loss. But it seems

16:01.915 --> 16:05.340
as if the universe has,
through some clerical error,

16:05.409 --> 16:07.609
given you a chance to right your wrongs.

16:07.678 --> 16:10.145
Ahem! I don't do the girlfriend thing.

16:11.183 --> 16:13.315
What makes you think that I want that?

16:13.384 --> 16:14.975
My past experience.

16:16.787 --> 16:19.721
What do you say we get together
tomorrow and discuss this?

16:19.790 --> 16:21.757
Ooh, sorry, I'm booked.

16:22.777 --> 16:23.926
I'm donating

16:23.961 --> 16:26.103
flowers to an event tomorrow night.

16:26.566 --> 16:30.094
- That's very generous.
- I'm a giver.

16:32.803 --> 16:35.003
How about I help you with your order

16:35.039 --> 16:37.506
and then we can grab some food.

16:40.262 --> 16:41.657
Is it a date?

16:42.879 --> 16:45.614
Well, I suppose I could
give you one more chance.

16:45.649 --> 16:47.798
Well, you are a giver.

17:10.796 --> 17:12.509
I don't know how you got me here.

17:12.943 --> 17:14.750
Deep down, you know this
is where you need to be.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.563
Last night, I...

17:18.648 --> 17:21.316
- You saw the same ghost?
- No,

17:21.352 --> 17:22.656
it was my sister this time.

17:23.420 --> 17:26.241
As clear as day, just... standing there.

17:26.890 --> 17:29.958
- She was so real.
- Your sister passed away?

17:29.994 --> 17:32.227
He's going to think I'm crazy.

17:32.262 --> 17:34.952
I'm kind of tired of seeing doctors.

17:34.988 --> 17:37.633
I'll try not to take
that last comment personally.

17:37.668 --> 17:39.881
Dan, this is Dr. Radford.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.149
You've seen a lot of doctors lately?

17:42.773 --> 17:45.540
Because of my family history,
I just had an angiograph.

17:45.968 --> 17:48.576
- Oh, everything OK?
- Turns out it was just a glitch

17:48.612 --> 17:51.693
- on my EKG; my heart is fine.
- That's good news.

17:52.016 --> 17:55.283
No offense, but it's not me
who has the problem,

17:55.319 --> 17:57.753
it's Grey House. It's haunted.

17:59.574 --> 18:01.789
Well, if you have an internal infection,

18:01.859 --> 18:04.092
and you're spiking a fever,
that alone would explain

18:04.128 --> 18:06.962
your symptoms. Why don't we

18:07.031 --> 18:08.997
just do a check-up,
rule some things out?

18:10.630 --> 18:11.565
All right,

18:11.635 --> 18:14.269
- you can do an exam.
- Great.

18:14.304 --> 18:15.798
- I'll pick you up later.
- You're in great hands.

18:16.551 --> 18:19.508
- Eve.
- Let's get you set up.

18:23.013 --> 18:25.580
So tell me, how is it
going with the list?

18:25.649 --> 18:27.416
- The list?
- Yeah, the lake house?

18:27.484 --> 18:29.885
Oh. Well, the pros and cons

18:29.953 --> 18:32.954
- are... about the same.
- Hm, So they're even.

18:33.023 --> 18:35.023
Yeah, there are as many
reasons to want to buy it

18:35.092 --> 18:37.893
- as there are to walk away.
- But you haven't walked away.

18:37.961 --> 18:39.961
No, there's still time
to put in an offer.

18:40.030 --> 18:41.630
So, maybe there's a reason
that you haven't made

18:41.699 --> 18:43.411
a written offer on the house?

18:47.652 --> 18:49.237
I'm glad you could join me.

18:49.306 --> 18:50.100
Yes!

18:50.845 --> 18:53.488
And what a celebratory lunch this was.

18:53.641 --> 18:57.145
Oh! Ah.

18:57.214 --> 18:58.516
This is work...

18:59.550 --> 19:01.416
Just give me a minute. Here.

19:01.452 --> 19:04.586
For the bill. Hello?

19:05.610 --> 19:07.855
Mm-hm.

19:23.207 --> 19:25.774
Terrific. I gotta go, bye.

19:27.745 --> 19:29.678
- Hm!
- Ahem!

19:29.713 --> 19:31.747
Thank you.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.248
So,

19:34.318 --> 19:36.184
have you seen Cassie lately?

19:36.220 --> 19:39.621
No. Why do you ask?

19:39.923 --> 19:43.358
No reason. Just making conversation.

19:55.773 --> 19:57.242
This is really good!

19:58.041 --> 20:00.008
It's not "private chef" good.

20:00.043 --> 20:03.378
- You're kidding right?
- You're not kidding?

20:04.529 --> 20:07.148
Donna and Chad have such a great life!

20:07.184 --> 20:10.218
- We have a great life.
- Well, not "heli-skiing

20:10.254 --> 20:12.487
in Jackson Hole
with a private chef" great.

20:12.523 --> 20:15.991
We don't need a private
chef and you hate skiing.

20:16.026 --> 20:19.227
- It's just...
- What?

20:19.673 --> 20:21.530
They're so perfect.

20:22.065 --> 20:25.133
They have a successful business,
they go travelling all the time,

20:25.169 --> 20:27.669
- they have a summer house...
- So?

20:27.704 --> 20:31.306
It just makes me feel
like... an underachiever.

20:31.341 --> 20:33.308
Tara, you're working on your PhD,

20:33.343 --> 20:37.212
you are hardly an underachiever.

20:37.652 --> 20:40.515
- What is it?
- That's just it...

20:43.666 --> 20:44.873
I left the program.

20:45.956 --> 20:49.791
- You quit grad school?
- I don't want to get my PhD.

20:50.799 --> 20:53.160
I officially withdrew last week.

20:58.309 --> 21:00.235
- Hi.
- John!

21:00.270 --> 21:02.504
- What can I do for you?
- I heard through the grapevine

21:02.539 --> 21:04.673
that you were throwing a
surprise dinner for the two us.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.403
Sounds like fun.

21:07.311 --> 21:09.711
Um...

21:18.259 --> 21:20.426
The dinner for us; it's a ruse

21:20.461 --> 21:22.928
so Martha doesn't find out about
her surprise anniversary party.

21:22.997 --> 21:25.965
OK. That makes sense. Kind of.

21:26.033 --> 21:28.901
Oh! Well, Martha
is a bit of a bloodhound,

21:28.970 --> 21:31.103
so everyone has had
to go to great lengths.

21:31.172 --> 21:34.306
Well, now that I know my schedule
is free, I'll be on my way.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.308
You should come to the party. Yeah,

21:36.377 --> 21:38.777
it would be a great way for you
to meet new people in town.

21:39.584 --> 21:41.981
I need to make a decision on
that field supervisor position.

21:42.049 --> 21:45.317
- I can't do that at a party.
- I understand.

21:45.536 --> 21:48.287
- You're so close.
- Yeah.

21:48.356 --> 21:50.055
Well, uh, if you run into Martha...

21:50.728 --> 21:52.458
As far as she knows, we're
on a fake date for dinner

21:52.526 --> 21:54.945
- at Grey House.
- Thanks.

21:55.363 --> 21:56.856
Happy to help.

22:02.503 --> 22:04.903
Uh, can you proof my London essay?

22:04.972 --> 22:07.473
- Yeah!
- Thanks. Man, it took forever.

22:07.541 --> 22:09.642
- You struggled with it?
- Uh...

22:09.677 --> 22:12.177
Or are you struggling
with something new?

22:12.576 --> 22:15.180
It's just that,
as part of the application,

22:15.249 --> 22:17.216
- I have to sign a contract.
- What?

22:17.251 --> 22:20.185
Unless I have
a "Dire Medical Emergency",

22:20.221 --> 22:22.360
I have to stay and
finish out the program.

22:23.904 --> 22:25.357
Yeah.

22:25.393 --> 22:28.327
Once I get there,
there's no coming back.

22:28.884 --> 22:31.630
They aren't going to force you
to stay if you don't want to.

22:31.985 --> 22:34.366
But if I leave before it's over,

22:34.435 --> 22:38.270
then everyone, including my dad,
will know I couldn't hack it.

22:39.276 --> 22:42.975
Anyway, can you please
just proof the essay?

22:43.401 --> 22:45.477
Nick, I'm on it.

22:45.513 --> 22:47.730
- Thanks, Grace.
- Yeah!

22:50.289 --> 22:51.632
That's the Globe.

22:54.422 --> 22:56.288
- Excuse me?
- Your T-shirt;

22:56.323 --> 22:58.190
that's the Globe Theatre in London.

22:58.259 --> 23:00.359
I didn't know.

23:00.394 --> 23:03.562
My mom just gave it to me.
You've been there?

23:03.597 --> 23:06.098
- I have.
- You've been to London?

23:06.133 --> 23:09.201
Lived there. My mom is
American, but my dad is English.

23:09.236 --> 23:11.178
That is so cool!

23:11.972 --> 23:14.640
Wait, you and I have biology together.

23:15.033 --> 23:17.976
- Not for much longer, I think.
- I failed the last quiz.

23:18.012 --> 23:21.547
- I'm sorry.
- Not half as sorry as my dad!

23:21.582 --> 23:23.749
He's a big time surgeon.

23:24.953 --> 23:26.351
I could help.

23:26.387 --> 23:28.087
You don't have to be
nice to the new kid.

23:28.122 --> 23:30.622
- No, no, I want to help.
- It's possible

23:30.658 --> 23:33.192
- I'm a lost cause.
- Trust me, I've got this!

23:33.227 --> 23:34.593
Then I'm glad I found you.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.832
Ah-HA! I have proof!

23:40.868 --> 23:42.593
Hello, Martha!

23:43.604 --> 23:46.839
I asked Tom if he had
seen you recently. He said no.

23:46.874 --> 23:49.341
He's lying, and this receipt proves it.

23:49.376 --> 23:51.076
Now, I demand that you tell me the truth

23:51.112 --> 23:53.779
about my anniversary. Please,

23:53.814 --> 23:56.381
it's making me crazy not to know.

23:56.417 --> 23:58.353
The truth is something
you don't want to hear.

24:00.489 --> 24:02.254
I knew it.

24:02.289 --> 24:04.723
I think you should focus less
on what Tom is doing for you

24:04.759 --> 24:06.913
and think about what you can do for Tom.

24:07.228 --> 24:10.429
- But romance is his job.
- It's always been his job.

24:10.464 --> 24:13.198
Well then, he'd be really
surprised if you did something.

24:13.570 --> 24:14.730
He would be.

24:15.236 --> 24:17.369
He'd be embarrassed.

24:18.121 --> 24:20.038
I'm going to find him the most

24:20.074 --> 24:22.808
heartfelt, romantic present
ever. He will have done nothing

24:22.877 --> 24:25.644
for me. He will feel awful
and I'll feel vindicated.

24:25.679 --> 24:27.713
It's not a party,
but it will have to do.

24:27.782 --> 24:30.549
- Martha, that's not my point.
- Well, it is my point.

24:30.618 --> 24:32.518
Please, Cassie, I need a gift.

24:32.586 --> 24:35.220
A perfect gift.

24:36.010 --> 24:37.356
The traditional gift

24:37.424 --> 24:39.958
for the thirtieth anniversary is pearl.

24:39.994 --> 24:42.961
Pearl? You want me
to get Tom a string of pearls

24:43.030 --> 24:45.397
- like I wore on my wedding day?
- It's your gift;

24:45.466 --> 24:47.666
you have to decide how best
to express your feelings.

24:47.735 --> 24:50.369
Pearl! Ha! As if.

24:50.437 --> 24:52.538
You know, I think the fumes
from all these candles

24:52.573 --> 24:55.407
are finally getting to you,
Miss Cassie Nightingale.

24:57.378 --> 24:59.278
Pearl, ha!

25:06.487 --> 25:07.730
Oh, you're still up?

25:08.722 --> 25:10.778
I waited.

25:11.892 --> 25:14.626
- I know you're angry.
- Confused.

25:15.242 --> 25:17.162
Why didn't you tell me
about grad school?

25:18.425 --> 25:19.832
I guess I was afraid

25:19.867 --> 25:22.034
that you would think I was
making a mistake, and you'd try

25:22.069 --> 25:23.369
to talk me out of it.

25:24.371 --> 25:27.785
- But this is what I really want.
- Then, it's what I want.

25:28.913 --> 25:31.109
- Really?
- I don't want you to do

25:31.145 --> 25:33.879
- anything that you don't love.
- I just,

25:33.948 --> 25:36.514
- I feel like such a failure.
- You're not.

25:37.331 --> 25:39.218
I bet Donna would never have quit.

25:39.253 --> 25:42.187
Hey, you can't compare
yourself to her or anybody else.

25:42.223 --> 25:44.202
She's just so perfect.

25:45.697 --> 25:48.560
To me... you're perfect.

25:49.770 --> 25:51.063
I love you.

25:57.605 --> 25:59.504
But going forward,
we don't keep anything

25:59.573 --> 26:02.474
from each other, OK? Promise?

26:19.593 --> 26:22.294
- This number has to be wrong.
- It isn't.

26:22.818 --> 26:24.763
That's the rent?

26:24.798 --> 26:27.199
- It's a steal.
- The landlord just wants

26:27.234 --> 26:29.156
a good, long-term tenant.

26:30.004 --> 26:32.532
- And all the kitchen equipment?
- Comes with.

26:33.574 --> 26:35.741
So I won't have
to build up from scratch.

26:35.776 --> 26:38.310
If you're serious about
starting a catering business,

26:38.828 --> 26:41.079
this is the place. Rent's low,

26:41.115 --> 26:44.449
fully loaded... close to the Bistro.

26:44.485 --> 26:47.920
Can I come back and
see the space again tomorrow?

26:47.955 --> 26:50.055
Oh, sure... Do you need
to show it to the bank

26:50.090 --> 26:52.324
or an investor? I can coordinate.

26:52.359 --> 26:54.559
- What?
- Your financing;

26:54.595 --> 26:58.163
who's your partner in this?

27:02.703 --> 27:06.171
...so, in cellular
respiration, all of the carbons

27:06.240 --> 27:09.074
of glucose are actually
converted into carbon dioxide.

27:09.109 --> 27:11.710
- OK, I get that.
- I finally get that.

27:11.745 --> 27:13.979
You know, we should be lab partners.

27:15.084 --> 27:16.214
That would be awesome.

27:16.283 --> 27:18.383
Yeah, I'll talk to Mr. Rock. He's cool.

27:18.419 --> 27:20.752
I just wish I could do
something for you.

27:20.821 --> 27:24.122
- Oh, stop. Ah! Hey, Mom!
- Oh, hey!

27:24.191 --> 27:26.892
- This is my friend Katie...
- It's nice to meet you.

27:26.961 --> 27:28.760
It's nice to meet you too, Mrs. Russell.

27:28.796 --> 27:31.997
- Call me Cassie.
- I love Grace's T-shirt.

27:32.032 --> 27:35.667
Yes, and Katie is from London.

27:35.703 --> 27:37.336
Ah!

27:37.371 --> 27:39.504
Oh, that's my dad, excuse me.

27:42.419 --> 27:44.283
- Mom?
- Yeah?

27:44.878 --> 27:47.946
- Can Katie come to Martha's party with us?
-  Of course.

27:48.747 --> 27:49.681
Cool.

27:57.611 --> 28:00.659
So, I won't be needing your
help with the flowers later.

28:00.728 --> 28:03.128
Ah... Really?

28:03.197 --> 28:06.865
I've got it covered. I'm
switching cars with Brandon.

28:06.934 --> 28:10.736
- Still, it's a lot to load up.
- I think she has some help.

28:10.804 --> 28:13.774
Well, thank you Greg.

28:14.341 --> 28:17.075
- So you have what you want.
- Did you ever doubt me?

28:17.144 --> 28:18.019
No.

28:19.555 --> 28:21.980
Hey there.

28:22.049 --> 28:24.660
Sam, hey! Come on in.

28:25.556 --> 28:28.153
So, uh... I heard
from Dan that all his tests

28:28.222 --> 28:30.422
- came back negative.
- Yeah, his physical checked out

28:30.491 --> 28:33.191
completely normal.
No fever, no infection

28:33.227 --> 28:35.731
no apparent complications
from the angiograph,

28:36.096 --> 28:38.263
but I still think something's
wrong with him physically.

28:38.850 --> 28:41.266
Well, he said the ghost is now
in the image of his sister.

28:41.864 --> 28:44.503
- His sister passed away?
- Yah, but he swears it was her.

28:44.538 --> 28:47.739
He said the image was
real, clear, very lifelike.

28:48.986 --> 28:50.976
It's like his brain is
trying to tell him something.

28:51.281 --> 28:54.079
- Yeah, or us.
- Brain...

28:55.154 --> 28:57.049
Wait, you said it was... clear.

28:57.084 --> 29:00.152
very lifelike, this image
of his sister, the... ghost?

29:00.220 --> 29:03.321
- Yeah, that's what he said.
- I'll call ahead.

29:04.194 --> 29:06.925
- I think Dan needs an MRI.
- Really?

29:07.505 --> 29:10.195
- It's the only way we'll know.
- Know what?

29:10.264 --> 29:12.564
If my hunch is right.

29:20.416 --> 29:22.761
Well, your MRI did detect

29:22.802 --> 29:25.283
minimal damage to the midbrain.

29:25.969 --> 29:28.683
I think you might be suffering
from Peduncular Hallucinosis.

29:28.718 --> 29:31.819
It's a rare condition that causes

29:31.855 --> 29:34.019
extremely lifelike hallucinations.

29:34.591 --> 29:36.347
But it's not as bad as it sounds.

29:37.394 --> 29:40.461
- What causes it?
- Well, in very rare instances,

29:41.234 --> 29:43.464
an angiograph procedure can cause

29:43.500 --> 29:46.367
a small clot to dislodge
and lead to a tiny lesion

29:46.403 --> 29:49.437
in your brain and that's what
triggers the hallucinations.

29:51.298 --> 29:52.873
I don't know what to say.

29:52.909 --> 29:55.209
it can be successfully treated

29:55.245 --> 29:57.445
with drug therapy.
I've already contacted

29:57.480 --> 29:58.991
one of the top neurologists in Chicago

29:59.016 --> 30:00.906
and he's agreed to see you
for a treatment plan.

30:01.696 --> 30:03.550
Thank you, Dr. Radford.

30:03.586 --> 30:05.520
Glad I could help.

30:05.555 --> 30:07.488
And I live right next door to Grey House

30:07.524 --> 30:10.558
if you have any questions or
need to talk before you leave.

30:10.627 --> 30:13.428
I'll be tracking your treatment
and your progress. It's

30:13.463 --> 30:15.463
out of sight, is not
out of mind with me.

30:15.532 --> 30:17.498
OK? And of course,

30:17.567 --> 30:19.801
they'll have some forms
they want you to fill out.

30:19.836 --> 30:22.470
- Thank you.
- We'll be right back.

30:25.275 --> 30:28.176
My guy in Chicago? The best, seriously.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.645
Yeah, maybe not the best.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.347
- Sam!
- Hey!

30:33.382 --> 30:35.603
Valerie Hanson, Cassie Nightingale.

30:36.070 --> 30:38.052
- Nice to meet you.
- You as well.

30:38.088 --> 30:40.088
I'm gonna go check on Dan. Excuse me.

30:41.989 --> 30:43.423
Are you admitting a patient?

30:43.493 --> 30:45.310
Actually, solving a mystery.

30:45.562 --> 30:48.930
Peduncular Hallucinosis.
It's a... rare illness.

30:48.999 --> 30:52.333
- It's about one in 300 million.
- And we have a case of it here?

30:52.402 --> 30:54.669
Middleton. I brought him in for an MRI.

30:54.738 --> 30:57.205
- 1 in 300 million?
- I have a good friend

30:57.273 --> 30:59.340
in New York who is a
neurosurgeon and we were both

30:59.409 --> 31:01.809
at the hospital there and
we had a very similar patient.

31:01.878 --> 31:04.879
But that person ended up
suffering from psychosis, it was

31:04.948 --> 31:06.848
- mental, not physical.
- So that's what made you think

31:06.916 --> 31:09.117
- of this, or...
- No, not really,

31:09.185 --> 31:11.986
but once I lock onto
to something, it's not

31:12.055 --> 31:15.156
- in my nature to let go.
- Well, lucky for the patient.

31:15.225 --> 31:17.725
My colleague in Chicago wants to...

31:17.794 --> 31:19.605
do a paper, research.

31:20.156 --> 31:21.433
What do you want?

31:22.285 --> 31:24.926
Well, my patient to get
better. Now he will.

31:26.345 --> 31:27.734
Hm!

31:36.879 --> 31:38.546
Oh.

32:11.182 --> 32:12.460
True story, I swear.

32:12.959 --> 32:16.283
Wow. That's a long story
about you and a shark.

32:16.319 --> 32:18.352
- I love surfing.
- I was...

32:18.388 --> 32:20.181
- Only big waves, though.
- Well, I...

32:20.206 --> 32:22.690
- Have you been surfing?
- Yeah, it's not the same.

32:22.725 --> 32:25.593
as when you're towed out
to a 30 foot wave...

32:25.628 --> 32:29.030
It's... well, not a lot
of people have done it.

32:29.065 --> 32:32.333
- Not that I'm bragging but...
- I think...

32:32.368 --> 32:34.836
...I think what's great
about it is that it forces you

32:34.871 --> 32:38.239
to see your place in the
universe. It's very Zen.

32:38.274 --> 32:40.541
- You meditate?
- Yeah, I once went

32:40.577 --> 32:43.544
on this spiritual retreat
in India... it was amazing.

32:43.613 --> 32:45.780
Got me to stop focusing on myself.

32:45.815 --> 32:48.549
- You don't say!
- It blew my mind.

32:48.585 --> 32:49.742
I know the feeling.

32:52.689 --> 32:55.356
I just realized I have
been talking about myself

32:55.391 --> 32:57.825
since we got into the car, haven't I?

32:57.861 --> 32:59.760
Enough about me.

33:00.316 --> 33:03.564
But I really want you to see
the photos from over there.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.466
Of surfing or Zen-ing?

33:05.843 --> 33:07.435
Oh, that's a great one...

33:07.504 --> 33:10.104
Yeah, that is a great picture
of you and a girl in a bikini!

33:10.173 --> 33:13.007
That's my girlfriend. Ex.

33:13.572 --> 33:15.243
She was something else. though.

33:15.803 --> 33:17.878
You don't say.

33:19.983 --> 33:22.183
Thanks for helping.

33:22.252 --> 33:24.919
- You know I'm here for you.
- I do. And...

33:25.483 --> 33:28.623
I found a space. The space
you showed me that day.

33:28.691 --> 33:31.092
- That's great!
- I'll tell my friend!

33:34.197 --> 33:37.365
- You're going to really like him.
- I probably would...

33:37.400 --> 33:41.169
but, um... I'm going
to invest in myself.

33:41.237 --> 33:44.672
- Oh! How?
- I ran the numbers

33:44.741 --> 33:47.875
and I can do it. If I keep the costs low

33:47.944 --> 33:50.912
and with the cheaper
rent, I can. It'll work!

33:50.947 --> 33:52.780
And I'll reinvest
the profits from the Bistro

33:52.849 --> 33:54.482
into the catering business
until the catering business

33:54.551 --> 33:57.585
can stand on its own. What do you think?

33:57.899 --> 34:00.320
- I like it.
- I love it!

34:00.651 --> 34:02.477
I love you when you're like this.

34:06.362 --> 34:08.996
- Thomas from the glass shop.
- Yeah...

34:09.565 --> 34:10.725
Hey, Thomas.

34:23.980 --> 34:26.514
I still don't understand
what's going on.

34:26.549 --> 34:29.550
- Tom will explain.
- Tom?!

34:29.619 --> 34:30.560
Mm-hm!

34:32.021 --> 34:34.054
In the name of all that is holy,

34:34.123 --> 34:35.889
where are you taking me?

34:35.925 --> 34:38.561
SURPRISE!!

34:40.145 --> 34:41.996
Happy anniversary!

34:42.728 --> 34:45.799
I can't believe that Tom
kept this from me.

34:48.312 --> 34:50.370
That you all kept this from me.

34:53.208 --> 34:55.342
CHEERS!!

35:09.174 --> 35:10.413
Tom...

35:11.200 --> 35:14.477
all this, it's just... It's perfect.

35:14.512 --> 35:16.114
It was the only way
to make it a surprise.

35:16.581 --> 35:19.469
This looks just like where
we had our wedding reception.

35:20.068 --> 35:21.896
It's the perfect place for you and Tom.

35:24.539 --> 35:27.707
- You got me something.
- Well...

35:27.742 --> 35:31.143
pearls are for
your thirtieth anniversary.

35:33.081 --> 35:35.014
What a beautiful pearl frame.

35:37.385 --> 35:38.999
I love it.

35:41.983 --> 35:43.231
Excuse me.

35:45.752 --> 35:47.592
Thank you.

36:06.047 --> 36:08.381
Hi! I just booked a wedding.

36:08.449 --> 36:10.716
Oh! Sounds like you are
in the catering business?

36:10.752 --> 36:13.986
I am. And I found the perfect spot.

36:14.022 --> 36:16.389
I found it a few days ago
with Ben, but I wasn't ready

36:16.424 --> 36:19.625
- to consider starting a business.
- But in the light of day...

36:21.014 --> 36:22.293
But something's wrong?

36:23.312 --> 36:25.058
Or right. Or...

36:25.266 --> 36:26.523
I don't know.

36:28.102 --> 36:30.404
I think Ben may have
told me he loved me.

36:39.514 --> 36:41.747
- Thanks for inviting us.
- And whoever did the food;

36:41.816 --> 36:43.616
- really tasty.
- Stephanie.

36:43.684 --> 36:45.785
- She runs the Bistro.
- Maybe I can get her number.

36:45.853 --> 36:49.522
- Oh, for the office party?
- No, I was thinking we would

36:49.590 --> 36:51.394
have a big party for Mom's birthday.

36:51.859 --> 36:54.693
- They're in Florida.
- Actually, um,

36:54.762 --> 36:57.329
they're coming to stay
with us for the summer.

36:58.097 --> 36:59.464
Excuse me.

37:04.272 --> 37:06.739
He and my mom don't get along.

37:09.089 --> 37:10.290
I should go find him.

37:12.221 --> 37:13.345
Well...

37:14.182 --> 37:17.683
No couple is perfect.
Not even the Bryants.

37:23.991 --> 37:26.959
Abigail. Where's Greg?

37:26.994 --> 37:29.395
I sent him to get drinks.

37:30.102 --> 37:32.998
- I needed a break.
- A break?

37:33.807 --> 37:35.733
OK, you were right...

37:36.135 --> 37:38.136
...he's totally wrong for me.

37:39.157 --> 37:40.672
Sometimes, the chase

37:40.708 --> 37:43.075
is more exciting than
the object of the chase.

37:43.712 --> 37:46.045
All he does is talk about himself.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.747
You can't imagine.

37:56.090 --> 37:57.990
Well, if you'll excuse me

37:58.025 --> 37:59.992
I have to go fake a migraine...

38:01.640 --> 38:03.394
Mom!

38:03.431 --> 38:05.331
Honey, hey. Well,

38:05.366 --> 38:07.266
it seems like Nick and Katie
are hitting it off.

38:07.301 --> 38:09.368
Yes. I have a feeling

38:09.403 --> 38:11.376
Katie is going to help Nick with London.

38:11.839 --> 38:14.874
- Feels good to help?
- It feels great.

38:14.909 --> 38:18.210
- Oh, yeah. Be right back, OK?
- OK.

38:22.160 --> 38:25.284
- This is a great party.
- John!

38:25.319 --> 38:28.254
- I changed my mind.
- I'm glad you did!

38:28.825 --> 38:30.622
Thank you. It was nice
of you to invite me.

38:30.658 --> 38:32.591
Did you finally decide
on your field supervisor?

38:32.627 --> 38:35.961
No camping necessary. But I'm
not sure they'll take the job.

38:36.447 --> 38:38.930
It's the opportunity of a lifetime!

38:38.966 --> 38:42.568
- That's true, it is.
- And I'm offering it to you.

38:43.888 --> 38:44.904
Me?

38:44.939 --> 38:46.739
We've both been over hundreds of resumes

38:46.774 --> 38:49.408
and there is no one better
fit for the job than you.

38:49.443 --> 38:53.112
Um, I have, uh, responsibilities...

38:53.147 --> 38:56.382
Grace, my store... Grey House. Heh!

38:56.417 --> 38:58.284
Every obstacle has a solution.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.251
You taught me that.

39:00.936 --> 39:02.421
And if it's something you want to do,

39:02.456 --> 39:05.391
and I think you do,
I know you can find a way...

39:05.426 --> 39:07.512
"we" can find a way.

39:08.362 --> 39:10.329
I don't think I...

39:10.364 --> 39:13.558
Cassie, Grace can come
with you. We'll figure it out.

39:14.635 --> 39:15.663
Don't think.

39:16.537 --> 39:18.537
And don't dismiss it
out of hand. Just...

39:19.384 --> 39:21.240
sleep on it.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.923
- Oh!
- Cheers!

39:37.959 --> 39:39.587
What are we toasting to?

39:40.094 --> 39:42.595
- I got the lake house.
- You won the bidding war?

39:42.630 --> 39:44.530
Yeah, and not with the highest price.

39:44.565 --> 39:48.267
The list of pros and cons turned
into a letter to the seller.

39:48.336 --> 39:50.703
Hm! Must have been a very good letter.

39:50.771 --> 39:52.771
Well, I told him how the house
would give me an opportunity

39:52.840 --> 39:55.641
rarely afforded to parents;
to make up for lost time.

39:55.710 --> 39:59.478
- And he was swayed.
- Well, he's a father too.

39:59.547 --> 40:01.369
It's a good thing you shared your story.

40:01.522 --> 40:04.193
If I hadn't made that list,
I would never have written

40:04.218 --> 40:07.386
the letter. And if I hadn't
met you, I wouldn't have done

40:07.421 --> 40:10.456
- either of those things.
- It's a good thing we met.

40:10.524 --> 40:12.036
Kind of a game changer.

40:13.009 --> 40:14.727
Maybe for both of us.

40:15.945 --> 40:17.161
And...

40:17.231 --> 40:19.665
- Another toast!
- ...the hospital board

40:19.700 --> 40:22.501
accepted all my terms. I'm the
new Chief of Staff at Hillcrest.

40:22.570 --> 40:26.538
- Ha ha! Congratulations!
- What big news!

40:27.416 --> 40:29.340
Thanks. I did not think

40:29.410 --> 40:31.443
they would let me share
the job responsibilities

40:31.479 --> 40:33.445
- with another doctor.
- But they did.

40:33.481 --> 40:36.315
It was the only way I'd say
yes. I get to keep my practice

40:36.384 --> 40:37.834
here, and spend time with Nick.

40:38.352 --> 40:40.552
I've... grown pretty fond

40:40.588 --> 40:42.554
of my life here, in Middleton.

40:43.169 --> 40:44.522
And I have to say,

40:45.185 --> 40:47.925
diagnosing your guest
probably did something to...

40:47.962 --> 40:50.242
push the board to give me the job...

40:50.965 --> 40:53.465
- the way I wanted it.
- You are going to help

40:53.534 --> 40:57.136
a lot of people. You're
a good man and a great doctor.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.205
Your opinion really matters to me.

41:00.784 --> 41:02.111
Really?

41:02.677 --> 41:05.210
Yeah. Ever since I met you.

41:08.162 --> 41:09.815
John just asked me

41:09.850 --> 41:11.777
to join him on his dig.

41:13.791 --> 41:15.888
- In the Maldives?
- Yeah. He wants me

41:15.923 --> 41:17.841
to be his field supervisor.
