What's the hour?

01:50.085 --> 01:52.725
Late, early, I don't know.

01:56.645 --> 01:58.445
You should be sleeping.

01:59.605 --> 02:03.925
I can't. I'm beset by
obstacles and opportunities.

02:04.205 --> 02:06.605
What sort of obstacles?

02:08.325 --> 02:11.485
No sooner had Pope Paul
extended a credit to our bank

02:11.565 --> 02:13.644
<i>than he dies of heart failure,</i>

02:14.445 --> 02:17.405
<i>forcing the Curia to elect a new pope</i>
<i>as his successor.</i>

02:18.645 --> 02:21.165
The new Pope is an ally, is he not?

02:23.045 --> 02:27.165
Well, when he was Cardinal della Rovere,
he helped arrange my marriage.

02:28.365 --> 02:31.365
<i>Now that he's Pope Sixtus,</i>
<i>he has relatives...</i>

02:31.925 --> 02:33.765
<i>seeking favors.</i>

02:34.925 --> 02:40.245
<i>While Salviati waits, looking for</i>
<i>his moment to strike against us.</i>

02:40.765 --> 02:46.605
Mmm. Well, I'm sure Father Carlo
will defend your interests.

02:47.725 --> 02:50.565
Oh, he'll forestall them
for as long as he can, but...

02:52.085 --> 02:54.885
this is my moment, Lucrezia, I must...

02:56.045 --> 02:57.365
I must seize it.

03:00.685 --> 03:01.805
I see.

03:04.245 --> 03:06.525
And what do you want
to do with your moment?

03:09.245 --> 03:11.165
Make Florence into a true republic.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.285
I don't think
my husband will support that.

03:14.525 --> 03:16.205
Nor Jacopo Pazzi.

03:16.285 --> 03:19.725
No. No, I don't suppose they will.

03:19.965 --> 03:21.085
Where are you going?

03:21.325 --> 03:23.885
-Giuliano and I must ride to Milan.
-Whatever for?

03:25.565 --> 03:28.325
-To make sure our alliance is secure.
-Be careful.

03:29.445 --> 03:31.325
-I will
-No, I mean it.

03:32.645 --> 03:35.045
You barely escaped assassination once.

03:36.485 --> 03:40.245
It's a wasted life that I fear...
not death.

03:45.645 --> 03:47.565
Then I will fear it for you.

04:13.885 --> 04:16.565
I don't know
why we're courting Galeazzo Sforza

04:16.645 --> 04:18.445
when we should be
demanding justice at home.

04:18.965 --> 04:21.524
Because the future
lies in peace with our neighbors,

04:21.605 --> 04:23.284
not the quarrels of the past.

04:23.365 --> 04:24.565
[guard] Move back.

04:26.284 --> 04:27.765
-[horse neighing]
-[guard] Ride along.

04:28.645 --> 04:31.325
Lorenzo de' Medici,
here with my brother to see the Duke.

04:32.245 --> 04:33.245
This way, signore.

04:44.925 --> 04:47.085
Lorenzo, you coming?

04:59.405 --> 05:02.245
[boys singing choir music]

05:12.245 --> 05:13.405
-Enough.
-[singing stops]

05:15.045 --> 05:16.325
[dog panting]

05:16.525 --> 05:19.405
Lorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici...

05:19.845 --> 05:20.805
Welcome.

05:21.965 --> 05:25.565
Good to find such beauty
behind these tall, dark walls...

05:25.645 --> 05:29.445
A wise ruler not only shows his greatness
by dispensing beauty...

05:30.725 --> 05:33.645
-but must spill blood to protect it.
-[man] It's me you want.

05:34.245 --> 05:35.205
Please!

05:36.085 --> 05:38.845
-Please let her go.
-[Duke] Case in point.

05:40.245 --> 05:41.165
[groans]

05:42.365 --> 05:43.445
Come, son.

05:44.325 --> 05:45.205
Stay.

05:49.045 --> 05:51.445
-He's too young.
-To learn survival?

05:53.405 --> 05:54.685
You see, young Medici,

05:54.765 --> 05:57.445
as a sister of two kings,
my wife doesn't understand

05:57.525 --> 06:00.885
that some of us must earn the admiration
and fear of those they rule.

06:10.005 --> 06:12.365
This noble plotted to kill me.

06:19.365 --> 06:20.925
Spare her. She's with child.

06:21.645 --> 06:23.765
-[woman sobbing]
-Please.

06:24.165 --> 06:25.365
I beg you.

06:28.805 --> 06:32.365
My Lord, my Lord, the painting in
the hallway of the<i> Last Judgement...</i>

06:33.325 --> 06:34.365
who is the artist?

06:35.805 --> 06:36.645
I forget.

06:37.285 --> 06:40.565
It's a reminder,
is it not, of Christ's teaching?

06:43.005 --> 06:45.445
There'll be no mercy for those
who do not show it.

06:55.685 --> 06:57.085
[humorless laughter]

06:58.605 --> 07:02.765
I am touched by your concern for my soul,
Lorenzo de' Medici.

07:07.605 --> 07:08.685
Go...

07:09.765 --> 07:10.925
I forgive you.

07:13.445 --> 07:15.285
[man] Thank you. Thank you.

07:17.245 --> 07:18.205
Thank you.

07:18.925 --> 07:19.965
Thank you.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.445
Thank you.

07:21.525 --> 07:25.685
I command that you'll love me
for my humility and kindness.

07:30.165 --> 07:33.245
[Lorenzo] We're here to discuss
repayment of your outstanding debt

07:34.285 --> 07:36.045
under the terms that is due.

07:37.965 --> 07:39.925
I was sorry to hear
of your father's passing.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.525
But surely, he told you
I don't have the funds.

07:42.605 --> 07:45.645
I offered to repay my debt
with the soldiers you turned away.
Your wool mills in Segrate.

07:51.245 --> 07:52.805
That's still spinning profits?

07:54.965 --> 07:58.205
And then, there's the tariffs
that you impose on trade with the North.

07:58.285 --> 08:00.405
You've done your research, young Medici.

08:01.245 --> 08:02.445
You can have your money.

08:04.085 --> 08:06.125
But I must break the treaty between
our two states.

08:06.205 --> 08:09.605
You would harm the interests
of your people and ours?

08:09.685 --> 08:11.325
Your brother leaves me no choice.

08:12.645 --> 08:13.685
Very well.

08:15.325 --> 08:17.445
-I will extend your loan repayment--
-Lorenzo.

08:17.525 --> 08:21.365
...if you divert the trade that you now
send through Bologna to Florence.

08:21.925 --> 08:25.525
Generating new revenue
that would flow through your bank.

08:28.085 --> 08:30.845
Oh, you are clever indeed, young Medici.

08:31.205 --> 08:32.805
[horse neighing in the distance]

08:33.005 --> 08:33.885
Very well.

08:35.965 --> 08:38.885
-Well played, brother.
-Thank you.

08:38.965 --> 08:39.924
[horse neighing]

08:40.044 --> 08:43.445
Except you can't change the treaty
with Milan, only the Priori can.

08:43.525 --> 08:45.445
Well, then, we'll have to get
the Priori on our side.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.605
[woman sobbing]

08:54.045 --> 08:55.565
He said he wouldn't kill him.

08:56.445 --> 08:57.725
To save face.

08:59.085 --> 09:01.405
Some men see mercy as weakness.

09:02.845 --> 09:04.445
[woman continues to sob]

09:25.725 --> 09:26.765
Come on...

09:27.565 --> 09:29.285
Mother will be waiting for us.

09:29.445 --> 09:30.605
I'll race you home.

09:30.725 --> 09:32.245
[horse neighing]

09:57.645 --> 09:59.645
Mother, has Clarice arrived?

09:59.725 --> 10:02.765
She's expected. Is it true...
you've extended the duke's credit?

10:03.125 --> 10:04.925
In exchange for more trade routes, yes.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.005
We need that debt repaid, son.
The Pope won't wait forever.

10:08.085 --> 10:12.165
We'll repay the Pope, Mother, as soon as
the Priori's agreed to the new treaty.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.645
You know many in the Priori
didn't want a treaty in the first place.

10:14.725 --> 10:17.165
And Jacopo Pazzi will be looking
for ways to oppose you.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.485
Yes, Mother. I know.

10:23.045 --> 10:24.725
Sandro, I was thinking...

10:26.605 --> 10:29.525
-you should have your own workshop.
-Mm-hmm. Couldn't possibly afford it.

10:29.605 --> 10:30.765
Oh, you don't have to.

10:32.925 --> 10:34.285
You're not serious.

10:34.965 --> 10:36.845
Find somewhere, I'll pay.

10:37.525 --> 10:38.525
[Giuliano] With what?

10:38.645 --> 10:41.765
Lorenzo, if there's anything
I can ever do to repay you--

10:41.845 --> 10:43.125
Actually, you can.

10:45.125 --> 10:47.965
I need you to undertake
a commission for Marco Vespucci.

10:48.805 --> 10:50.645
I have to be sure
of his support in the Priori.

10:50.725 --> 10:51.565
I'll do it.

10:53.405 --> 10:54.605
Why was that so easy?

10:54.685 --> 10:57.525
Oh, he detests Vespucci,
but he loves his wife.

10:57.605 --> 11:02.205
All my life, I have tried to capture
a small piece of God's beauty

11:02.285 --> 11:05.245
and I failed time and time and time again,
I have failed.

11:05.325 --> 11:07.725
Almost so much that I almost gave up...

11:08.525 --> 11:11.645
until I saw Simonetta Vespucci,

11:12.005 --> 11:15.605
the single most beautiful creature
I have ever seen.

11:15.685 --> 11:18.285
And it was then that I realized,
in my heart, it is possible.

11:18.365 --> 11:19.685
If I can capture that...

11:22.485 --> 11:26.085
You truly understand
the weight of a dream, Sandro.

11:27.725 --> 11:29.445
Never ever give that up.

11:31.605 --> 11:34.685
Thank you so much, Lorenzo. [chuckles]

11:35.725 --> 11:37.325
[chuckling] Thank you.

11:37.485 --> 11:42.045
[man] Gentlemen, I see we have a quorum.
So, I will now call this session to order.

11:43.165 --> 11:46.645
First, let us welcome a new member

11:46.725 --> 11:49.525
to replace the ailing Messer Martino...

11:50.005 --> 11:52.965
-Francesco Pazzi.
-[crowd applauding]

12:00.405 --> 12:01.325
Now to business.

12:01.645 --> 12:05.205
Messer Medici,
you have just returned from Milan.

12:05.285 --> 12:06.245
Yes.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.405
I met with Duke Galeazzo Sforza

12:09.485 --> 12:14.005
and I renegotiated our treaty
with far better terms for Florence.

12:18.325 --> 12:20.205
Under the proposed changes,

12:20.805 --> 12:25.445
trade routes will be diverted
from Bologna to Florence...

12:26.605 --> 12:28.325
generating more revenue for our people.

12:28.405 --> 12:30.205
And for the Medici bank.

12:30.285 --> 12:31.205
[all laugh]

12:32.605 --> 12:34.485
If increased trade is the aim...

12:35.085 --> 12:38.445
we would be better off seeking
to ally ourselves with Venice again.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.125
A few weeks ago, was not Messer Pazzi

12:41.405 --> 12:43.325
clamoring for war with Venice?

12:43.405 --> 12:44.405
[all murmuring assent]

12:44.485 --> 12:47.565
Now he seeks increased trade, gentlemen.

12:47.965 --> 12:50.485
My uncle is weary of Medici trickery

12:50.885 --> 12:54.365
using this republic
to serve their bank's interests.

12:54.445 --> 12:55.725
[crowd speaking indistinctly]

12:57.045 --> 12:59.325
It's in the interests of the Medici bank,

12:59.805 --> 13:01.405
that Florence flourish.

13:03.365 --> 13:06.325
I encourage you all
to inspect the treaty--

13:06.405 --> 13:08.605
And to vote it down
if you don't like what you see.

13:08.725 --> 13:10.485
[crowd screaming in the room]

13:12.845 --> 13:14.285
[indistinct yelling]

13:27.765 --> 13:30.445
Don't take it personally. [laughs]

13:31.045 --> 13:33.645
Why must you be against anything
that helps the common man?

13:33.725 --> 13:37.205
You weaken this republic,
you empower the rabble.

13:37.725 --> 13:38.805
I'll have none of it.

13:40.085 --> 13:41.125
Francesco.

13:41.965 --> 13:43.685
The world doesn't have to be this way.

13:43.765 --> 13:45.125
We could change it.

13:46.445 --> 13:48.485
The world is the way it is
for a good reason.

13:48.725 --> 13:51.005
As long as Florentine families are
at each other's throats,

13:51.085 --> 13:52.645
it will never be as good as it could be.

13:59.685 --> 14:01.765
Send word to Salviati in Rome.

14:01.845 --> 14:02.885
What shall I tell him?

14:03.685 --> 14:06.965
That Medici's scheming threatens
Holy Mother Church.

14:07.245 --> 14:09.645
The new Pope helped
arrange Lorenzo's marriage,

14:09.725 --> 14:10.885
calls him a friend.

14:12.845 --> 14:14.725
Have I taught you nothing, Nephew?

14:16.005 --> 14:18.125
There are no friends in politics.

14:20.565 --> 14:22.885
[indistinct chatter]

14:42.605 --> 14:44.085
[Simonetta] They're lovely, aren't they?

14:44.965 --> 14:46.925
I could gaze on them all day.

14:47.085 --> 14:49.285
Ma donna Simonetta, it's a great pleasure.

14:50.485 --> 14:52.005
I was looking for your husband.

14:53.605 --> 14:54.565
Why?

14:56.085 --> 14:59.605
Lorenzo de' Medici offers my services.
He had hoped...

15:01.765 --> 15:04.485
I had hoped to include you in a painting.

15:05.685 --> 15:06.685
No.

15:08.525 --> 15:10.245
May I ask why?

15:11.725 --> 15:13.165
[bird chirping]

15:13.405 --> 15:17.285
Some men like to keep
beautiful things in cages,

15:17.405 --> 15:19.365
-on display for others.
-[chirping continues]

15:20.565 --> 15:21.645
I don't.

15:22.605 --> 15:23.805
Come, let me show you.

15:30.605 --> 15:32.245
When I paint them...
I do it to set them free.

15:37.045 --> 15:38.125
[chirping continues]

15:48.325 --> 15:50.005
Its wings were cut.

15:55.765 --> 15:58.165
I am nobody's prisoner, Sandro.

16:00.645 --> 16:02.485
My husband is busy today.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.125
If you wish, you may return tomorrow.

16:06.805 --> 16:08.285
He may see you then...

16:09.605 --> 16:11.245
or he may not.

16:11.325 --> 16:13.245
I will return every day, Ma donna,

16:13.685 --> 16:15.085
and I will beg...

16:15.165 --> 16:16.285
to paint you.

16:17.285 --> 16:19.445
To set you free, if not from a cage,

16:20.125 --> 16:23.165
then from the ravages of time itself.

16:27.365 --> 16:29.125
I will make you immortal.

16:38.685 --> 16:41.285
[indistinct conversation]

16:41.685 --> 16:43.525
[Francesco] Your Holiness,
I have urgent business.

16:45.365 --> 16:46.245
Please.

16:50.085 --> 16:55.085
Lorenzo de' Medici has renegotiated
Florence's treaty with Milan.

16:56.965 --> 16:58.365
And nobody's wronged with that.

16:59.605 --> 17:02.845
I know you are fond of young Lorenzo,

17:04.125 --> 17:05.765
but reinforcing this alliance

17:05.885 --> 17:10.124
may be an attempt to grow
Medici influence beyond Florence.

17:14.645 --> 17:15.965
Francesco...

17:16.645 --> 17:19.885
I know you blame the Medici
for your family's ruin,

17:20.925 --> 17:24.005
and that you owe
Jacopo Pazzi for your education.

17:25.485 --> 17:30.485
I can only imagine the pain you felt
losing a father at such a young age,

17:32.124 --> 17:34.685
and see your mother take her own life.

17:41.525 --> 17:45.205
Our Lord Jesus teaches forgiveness.

17:46.605 --> 17:48.525
You are right about Lorenzo.

17:49.845 --> 17:51.205
He is a friend...

17:55.165 --> 17:59.365
and until he actually harms
the interests of the papal states,

17:59.525 --> 18:02.245
I will not consider him an adversary.

18:05.045 --> 18:07.965
Should you happen to communicate it
with your uncle in the near future,

18:08.045 --> 18:10.365
you may wish to inform him of this.

18:15.245 --> 18:16.285
Stay.

18:18.125 --> 18:19.205
Sit.

18:20.845 --> 18:22.605
And finish your wine.

18:29.565 --> 18:31.725
[indistinct chatter]

18:36.445 --> 18:38.965
[old man] Behold the Duomo, Ma donna.

18:40.725 --> 18:42.965
The dome is magnificent, maestro.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.165
Conjured from the mind
of Filippo Brunelleschi

18:46.245 --> 18:48.245
at the behest of Lorenzo's grandfather.

18:49.005 --> 18:50.005
Cosimo.

18:50.925 --> 18:53.805
Florence is a city of fevered minds.

18:56.765 --> 18:58.485
What will people here think of me?

19:12.045 --> 19:13.725
I trust you had a pleasant journey.

19:13.805 --> 19:16.845
Maestro de' Becchi was kind enough
to serve as my escort.

19:17.965 --> 19:19.885
He must have been
a gifted tutor to Lorenzo.

19:19.965 --> 19:21.845
-Yeah.
-It has been my privilege.

19:21.925 --> 19:23.445
This is my daughter, Bianca.

19:23.565 --> 19:24.965
-Pleasure.
-Pleasure is mine.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.085
Lorenzo's not here?

19:27.165 --> 19:29.885
He'll be here soon.
You may wait in his rooms. Come.

19:50.125 --> 19:51.005
[door opens]

19:52.165 --> 19:53.205
I'm sorry.

19:53.805 --> 19:56.045
Please, look as long as you want.

19:57.245 --> 19:58.445
[door closes]

19:58.525 --> 19:59.605
How was your journey?

20:00.365 --> 20:02.045
I trust Gentile was good company.

20:02.725 --> 20:04.365
He was certainly informative.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.125
He has a passion for Florence.

20:06.605 --> 20:07.685
He bored you?

20:08.405 --> 20:10.405
No, that's not what I meant.

20:12.645 --> 20:16.565
Have you read it?
It's Ovid, the original text.

20:19.565 --> 20:21.005
You don't read Latin.

20:21.405 --> 20:23.845
I do have the Italian translation
here somewhere.

20:23.925 --> 20:25.405
No, it's not that.

20:29.325 --> 20:30.525
Well, what is it, then?

20:32.565 --> 20:36.405
I believe it instructs men
and women in the art of seduction.

20:39.525 --> 20:41.005
I should have thought.

20:42.365 --> 20:43.565
I'm sorry.

20:43.645 --> 20:46.445
No, it's I who's sorry.

20:46.525 --> 20:47.885
-[knock on the door]
-[door opens]

20:48.285 --> 20:49.525
Lorenzo, I--

20:50.645 --> 20:51.845
My apologies.

20:52.485 --> 20:57.325
Luca Soderini, this is... this is my wife,
Clarice de' Medici.

20:57.405 --> 20:58.325
Enchanted.

20:58.765 --> 21:02.205
Lorenzo, we must speak urgently,
in private might be best.

21:02.765 --> 21:04.325
Please go ahead.

21:08.845 --> 21:10.045
[door closes]

21:11.845 --> 21:14.925
Your father's cousin,
the Archbishop of Pisa has died.

21:15.685 --> 21:17.045
I'm sorry to hear it.

21:17.525 --> 21:21.325
If you don't move quickly
to replace him, the Pazzi will,

21:21.405 --> 21:23.805
with someone determined
to oppose you at all costs.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.725
I have someone in mind.

21:28.885 --> 21:32.685
My former tutor, Gentile de' Becchi.

21:33.285 --> 21:35.565
A wise and respected choice.

21:36.245 --> 21:39.365
Surely, even Jacopo Pazzi
could not find a reason to object.

21:39.445 --> 21:43.005
[scoffs] Well, if he can't find one,
then he'll just invent one.

21:44.165 --> 21:46.765
Get word to Carlo and Orsini in Rome.

21:47.165 --> 21:49.365
Tell them that we rely
on the Pope's support.

22:14.045 --> 22:16.965
Has Your Holiness arrived
at a suitable candidate

22:17.045 --> 22:20.165
to replace the late archbishop of Pisa?

22:20.405 --> 22:23.165
Are you familiar with John 21:18?

22:24.805 --> 22:29.085
"Very truly I tell you,
when you were younger,

22:29.365 --> 22:33.045
you dressed yourself
and went where you wanted."

22:33.125 --> 22:34.725
"But when you're old,

22:35.565 --> 22:37.685
you will stretch out your hands

22:37.845 --> 22:43.125
and someone else will dress you
and lead you where you do not want to go."

22:46.045 --> 22:49.165
Who do you believe
would make a good candidate?

22:53.565 --> 22:57.565
If you selected me,
I would represent papal interests in Pisa

22:57.725 --> 23:00.045
and also watch over
your interests in Florence.

23:00.685 --> 23:02.925
Unlike Lorenzo de' Medici's choice.

23:03.645 --> 23:05.805
Perhaps I misjudged his loyalties,

23:06.325 --> 23:08.765
but you can have no doubt of mine...

23:09.605 --> 23:10.805
Your Holiness.

23:19.565 --> 23:20.885
-Holiness.
-Holiness.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.245
Salviati.

23:30.245 --> 23:31.405
Medici.

23:31.485 --> 23:32.605
Tell me...

23:33.565 --> 23:35.445
who is your favored candidate?

23:35.525 --> 23:39.085
I think Lorenzo de' Medici has put
forward an excellent candidate,

23:39.165 --> 23:40.445
Gentile de' Becchi.
[footsteps approaching]

23:44.965 --> 23:46.885
-[Giuliano] The groom emerges at last.
-[man] There he is.

23:46.965 --> 23:49.325
You mustn't be late for your
own wedding feast, Lorenzo.

23:49.485 --> 23:52.405
I understand your bride isn't comfortable
with Florentine ways.

23:52.485 --> 23:53.805
Well, not yet, not yet.

23:53.885 --> 23:56.125
Perhaps you could win her over
with some of your verses?

23:56.205 --> 23:58.725
Oh, perhaps you can give us one now?

23:58.805 --> 24:02.005
-No, no, no, no, no, no!
-[all screaming]

24:03.085 --> 24:05.005
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

24:05.125 --> 24:07.285
[clears throat]

24:10.085 --> 24:12.965
-Cucumbers we've got.
-[man] Yes, we have.

24:13.045 --> 24:14.925
Some giant, some rough.

24:15.765 --> 24:18.165
Some seem awful bumpy,
swelling up and lumpy,

24:18.285 --> 24:19.965
you grab them with a fist, boys.

24:20.045 --> 24:22.845
You peel it back a bit,
you open wide and pumpy.

24:26.365 --> 24:27.685
It's like weaning a puppy.

24:31.925 --> 24:34.325
No man could have a better brother.

24:36.045 --> 24:37.805
My brother, the poet.

24:39.485 --> 24:42.085
-[man] That was good, really good.
-Excuse me a minute.

24:48.365 --> 24:49.605
Bianca...

24:50.325 --> 24:52.605
Bianca, what is it? Talk to me.

24:52.765 --> 24:54.005
[Bianca scoffs]

24:54.605 --> 24:56.965
Of all people, you can speak to me freely.

24:57.125 --> 25:00.085
Father would never have forced me
to marry Bastiano Soderini

25:00.165 --> 25:02.285
if he knew how unhappy it would make me.

25:02.365 --> 25:05.165
I'm sorry, but sometimes,
duty comes first.

25:13.605 --> 25:14.885
I love another.

25:19.445 --> 25:20.365
Who?

25:21.845 --> 25:22.885
Guglielmo Pazzi.

25:25.125 --> 25:26.925
Guglielmo-- Guglielmo Pazzi?
We were engaged as children.

25:28.885 --> 25:31.365
Oh, no, no, no, no,
Bianca, this can never be.

25:31.445 --> 25:32.565
Why not?

25:32.645 --> 25:35.125
Wouldn't a marriage alliance with
the Pazzi be better for us

25:35.205 --> 25:36.685
than with Soderini?

25:36.765 --> 25:40.285
-It would unite the city's two biggest--
-No, Bianca, you don't understand.

25:41.005 --> 25:43.005
Soderini is an ally.

25:43.565 --> 25:46.005
Jacopo will use any divide against us.

25:46.085 --> 25:48.405
If I do not win the vote
on the treaty with Milan,

25:48.485 --> 25:51.405
everything that I desire
for Florence will be lost.

25:51.645 --> 25:54.285
But what of me, of your family?

25:55.165 --> 25:57.205
Do our desires count for nothing?

25:57.285 --> 26:00.165
Brother, you must leave!

26:00.765 --> 26:03.445
[bells chiming]

26:03.605 --> 26:05.725
-I didn't mean--
-No, you didn't, did you?
Enjoy your wedding feast, Brother.

26:18.205 --> 26:22.125
[dance music playing]

26:32.885 --> 26:34.685
[indistinct conversations]

26:48.405 --> 26:50.485
[indistinct chatter]

27:08.205 --> 27:09.445
Ma donna...

27:11.885 --> 27:13.245
Lucrezia Donati Ardinghelli.

27:16.445 --> 27:19.485
It can't be easy
to leave a life one's known

27:19.565 --> 27:21.925
for a man you don't.

27:23.125 --> 27:25.005
I'm not the first to do so.

27:27.245 --> 27:29.085
And yet, if you don't mind my saying...

27:30.605 --> 27:34.125
you look a little... hesitant.

27:38.405 --> 27:40.765
Perhaps the people here
would have been happier if...

27:41.085 --> 27:43.085
Lorenzo had chosen to marry
one of their own.

27:52.645 --> 27:54.765
Nothing is as simple as it seems.

27:56.725 --> 27:58.965
I just wanted to know
if you were all right.

28:01.725 --> 28:03.365
Thank you for your kindness.

28:09.445 --> 28:12.685
[man] Lorenzo de' Medici... [chuckles]

28:14.405 --> 28:15.845
Oh, my boy!

28:17.525 --> 28:19.205
I'm so happy for you.

28:19.285 --> 28:21.525
Stefano, all the way from Volterra.

28:21.605 --> 28:24.765
Messer Maffei... so glad you could come.

28:25.125 --> 28:27.045
Uh, you know my son Antonio?

28:27.485 --> 28:28.645
Antonio.

28:28.725 --> 28:31.125
A toast. Come. Come.

28:33.845 --> 28:35.885
Long life to the Medici.

28:37.125 --> 28:38.405
Signor Vespucci.

28:38.765 --> 28:40.845
Signor Vespucci, excuse me, sir.

28:40.925 --> 28:42.205
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

28:42.645 --> 28:44.125
I have attended your house
these last few days
in hope of speaking to you.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.805
You have? I was not told.

28:48.365 --> 28:50.805
Look, Lorenzo de' Medici
offers my services.

28:51.725 --> 28:54.285
At your prices? No, thank you.

28:54.725 --> 28:57.325
-Lorenzo will cover the cost.
-Really?

28:59.245 --> 29:00.645
But what would you paint?

29:00.725 --> 29:03.445
What greater prize do you possess

29:03.725 --> 29:04.805
but your wife?

29:11.405 --> 29:13.925
Undying love bleeds from their eyes.

29:17.405 --> 29:19.405
Or what they believe to be love.

29:21.925 --> 29:24.205
You don't believe in love,
Messer de' Medici?

29:24.685 --> 29:26.805
It's just a pretty word to describe a...

29:26.885 --> 29:28.685
clutch of petty human emotions...

29:29.525 --> 29:32.485
desire, jealousy...

29:33.925 --> 29:35.245
possessiveness.

29:36.045 --> 29:38.405
You put the poets out of business.

29:44.645 --> 29:45.845
This is charming.

29:48.165 --> 29:50.445
A gift from my husband.

29:53.565 --> 29:56.245
So... do you believe in love?

30:06.445 --> 30:07.725
If you'll excuse me...

30:08.205 --> 30:09.285
Hmm.

30:11.565 --> 30:12.805
The pleasure was mine.
She's lovely.

30:43.325 --> 30:44.405
I mean it.

30:45.725 --> 30:47.645
I feel quite protective of her.

30:51.645 --> 30:52.965
When will I see you again?

30:54.445 --> 30:55.805
I'll send word...

30:57.245 --> 30:58.845
as soon as possible.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.885
[indistinct chatter]

31:29.765 --> 31:31.165
Lorenzo wouldn't listen.

31:31.805 --> 31:33.165
If we are to be together,

31:33.245 --> 31:34.965
we must think of ourselves alone.

31:36.045 --> 31:37.005
And our families?

31:37.765 --> 31:40.685
They plot, compromise, lie,

31:40.765 --> 31:43.205
and even kill to hold onto power.

31:43.285 --> 31:45.285
All we've done is love.

31:49.405 --> 31:54.325
We are free of obligation
to any but ourselves.

32:34.125 --> 32:38.245
This moment... is ours, ours alone.

32:38.325 --> 32:41.445
And whether it's this night
or another night,

32:41.525 --> 32:42.965
does not matter.

32:43.045 --> 32:44.245
I want to do my duty.

32:45.165 --> 32:46.285
Your duty?

32:47.165 --> 32:48.565
To be a good wife.

32:59.165 --> 33:00.765
If you want, I...

33:02.005 --> 33:03.365
I will read of it...

33:04.165 --> 33:05.205
out of respect for you.

33:06.005 --> 33:06.925
[scoffs]

33:08.965 --> 33:10.645
Out of respect for you,

33:12.125 --> 33:14.365
I would not ask it, but...

33:16.325 --> 33:18.325
Ovid insists...

33:18.405 --> 33:21.005
that a wife hiccup twice
on her wedding night.

33:21.325 --> 33:22.285
Hiccup twice?

33:25.405 --> 33:26.645
He doesn't, does he?

33:27.325 --> 33:28.445
No.

33:29.365 --> 33:30.565
No, he doesn't.

33:36.125 --> 33:37.085
Come.

33:39.045 --> 33:40.245
Let's do our duty.

33:45.925 --> 33:47.845
And we'll enjoy it if we can.

34:12.005 --> 34:13.005
Perhaps we may...

34:15.885 --> 34:16.965
enjoy it.
Bianca?

34:52.684 --> 34:54.045
Lorenzo, what is it?

34:55.445 --> 34:56.925
I think Bianca has run off

34:57.005 --> 34:58.525
with Guglielmo Pazzi.

34:59.285 --> 35:00.325
Guards!

35:02.405 --> 35:03.925
You find my sister and Guglielmo Pazzi.

35:04.005 --> 35:05.285
You bring them back here at once.
You understand?

35:05.365 --> 35:06.405
-Right.
-Go.

35:06.485 --> 35:07.565
Come on.

35:09.525 --> 35:11.005
[horses neighing]

36:22.685 --> 36:23.805
Bianca...

36:25.725 --> 36:27.005
If we do this,

36:27.525 --> 36:28.885
there is no going back.

36:29.645 --> 36:31.205
That is why we must.

36:32.445 --> 36:34.165
Your reputation will be ruined.

36:35.045 --> 36:36.965
A price I will pay to see we are together.

36:37.085 --> 36:38.325
Oh, my love!

36:39.045 --> 36:40.365
I cannot let you.

36:41.925 --> 36:42.805
I'm yours.

36:43.605 --> 36:44.685
You're mine.

36:58.485 --> 36:59.485
Here.

37:03.925 --> 37:05.085
[Jacopo] Francesco...

37:07.165 --> 37:08.405
Where is Guglielmo?

37:09.765 --> 37:11.645
There are rumors
he has run off with a girl.

37:11.725 --> 37:12.685
What do you know? Speak.

37:12.765 --> 37:13.685
I'm not certain,

37:13.765 --> 37:15.805
but I suspect he's gone away with Bianca.

37:15.885 --> 37:17.485
-Bianca?
-De' Medici.

37:18.285 --> 37:19.485
That can't be.

37:20.045 --> 37:21.925
She's promised to Bastiano Soderini.

37:22.005 --> 37:24.085
Perhaps that's why she has run off.

37:24.845 --> 37:27.405
I must find them before it's too late.

37:30.005 --> 37:30.885
Wait.

37:33.565 --> 37:34.965
When this becomes public...

37:37.205 --> 37:40.925
it will destroy the alliance
between Lorenzo and Soderini.

37:41.485 --> 37:43.365
At the cost of Guglilelmo's reputation.

37:43.445 --> 37:44.485
He has made his bed.

37:44.565 --> 37:45.965
He'll be a pariah,

37:46.285 --> 37:48.765
shunned by polite society, they both will.

37:48.845 --> 37:51.165
You will go see Lorenzo de' Medici...

37:52.245 --> 37:54.125
to give him our terms.

37:55.925 --> 37:57.125
[Francesco] My uncle says

37:57.525 --> 38:00.365
you must break the treaty with Milan...

38:01.725 --> 38:04.685
or we will expose this scandal
for the good of Florence.

38:05.725 --> 38:09.685
So you hold your brother's reputation
hostage alongside my sister's.

38:12.005 --> 38:13.725
You surprise even me, Francesco.

38:16.845 --> 38:18.965
And I cannot sacrifice the treaty
with Milan.

38:19.925 --> 38:20.925
Why not?

38:21.525 --> 38:22.965
It's just a treaty.

38:27.365 --> 38:28.925
What is this really about?

38:29.445 --> 38:32.205
This is about making Florence
a true republic.

38:33.245 --> 38:34.525
Don't be ridiculous.

38:34.605 --> 38:36.245
Is it ridiculous?

38:37.125 --> 38:40.805
Why is it that we have to accept the world
that we are born into?

38:41.965 --> 38:43.805
Why can't we make it a better one?

38:44.405 --> 38:48.165
You would surrender your power
and advantage

38:48.285 --> 38:49.485
to share it with a common man.

38:49.565 --> 38:51.365
Well, I can't attempt it

38:51.445 --> 38:53.965
unless our alliance is secure.

38:55.405 --> 38:58.405
If I can save Guglielmo and Bianca

38:58.485 --> 39:00.685
without putting the treaty at risk...

39:01.645 --> 39:02.925
would you consider it?

39:04.485 --> 39:05.885
There is no way.

39:07.445 --> 39:09.485
All I'm asking for is time.

39:12.405 --> 39:15.445
For... for the sake of your brother,

39:15.525 --> 39:17.645
Francesco, if not for Florence.

39:23.325 --> 39:24.565
[man]<i> Ma donna, Bianca,</i>

39:24.645 --> 39:26.965
your brother is extremely worried
about you.

39:27.045 --> 39:29.205
I have orders to bring you back home.

39:29.285 --> 39:31.725
And I order you to stand down.

39:32.765 --> 39:35.085
You heard her. Leave.

39:37.605 --> 39:38.525
[guard grunts]

39:39.005 --> 39:41.485
[Bianca] No. No. No!

39:41.925 --> 39:44.285
Don't touch him. Don't touch him.

39:44.365 --> 39:45.685
I'm his wife.

39:49.045 --> 39:50.725
You took her virtue?

39:50.805 --> 39:52.885
We are married in the eyes of God.

39:54.405 --> 39:55.445
[Guglielmo]<i> Ahhh!</i>

40:06.925 --> 40:09.205
There you are, Messer Ovid...

40:12.005 --> 40:14.165
and in an Italian translation, too.

40:59.765 --> 41:00.685
[Bianca grunts]

41:02.525 --> 41:03.565
I'll speak with her.

41:07.125 --> 41:09.045
Your men beat Guglielmo.

41:09.125 --> 41:11.165
They shouldn't have done so,
and they will be reprimanded,

41:11.245 --> 41:12.405
but you disobeyed me, Bianca.

41:12.485 --> 41:14.085
What choice did you leave me?

41:16.405 --> 41:18.965
A life of unhappiness.

41:20.725 --> 41:23.245
You lead this family now, Lorenzo.

41:24.445 --> 41:27.845
Is... is that what you wish
for your sister?

41:31.365 --> 41:32.445
No.
No, it's not.

41:49.965 --> 41:51.885
Good. Good. Bring that over here.

41:51.965 --> 41:53.125
I'll take it.

41:53.405 --> 41:55.205
[Sandro] Ah. Fantastic.

41:55.885 --> 41:56.925
Yes.

41:59.205 --> 42:00.125
Ma donna Simonetta!

42:00.205 --> 42:02.445
To what do I owe the honor of this visit?

42:02.525 --> 42:04.165
Excuse me, maestro.

42:04.245 --> 42:06.285
I was told I might find
Giuliano de' Medici here.

42:08.285 --> 42:09.325
[clears throat]

42:11.645 --> 42:13.285
A word in private?

42:22.525 --> 42:23.685
You have something of mine.

42:23.765 --> 42:26.245
My husband will notice it's missing.

42:26.725 --> 42:29.165
I wouldn't want you getting
in any trouble.

42:30.045 --> 42:32.005
Sandro tells me he's to paint you.

42:32.085 --> 42:33.085
What is it to you?

42:33.845 --> 42:35.805
I intend to persuade him
to let me sit with you.

42:43.245 --> 42:44.845
You're like all the others.

42:44.925 --> 42:46.685
I'm not anything like them.

42:50.285 --> 42:52.685
It's not the mask that attracts me.

42:55.485 --> 42:57.565
It's what lies beneath it.

43:15.285 --> 43:17.325
[horse neighing]

43:17.525 --> 43:18.845
[guard] Open the gate!

43:22.005 --> 43:22.925
Carlo.
What's happened?

43:24.805 --> 43:26.165
The Pope has rejected Gentile,

43:26.245 --> 43:28.765
and he's appointed Salviati
as Pisa's new archbishop.

43:33.885 --> 43:35.605
[guard] Open the gates!

43:38.005 --> 43:39.605
I'm the new archbishop.

43:40.685 --> 43:42.685
I demand you open these gates.

43:43.285 --> 43:45.125
The appointment must be stopped, Carlo.

43:45.205 --> 43:48.405
I took the liberty of sending word to Pisa
in your name, Lorenzo,

43:48.485 --> 43:50.445
to bar Salviati from entering the city.

43:50.525 --> 43:51.805
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

43:54.165 --> 43:55.725
It's a wise move, Carlo.

44:12.245 --> 44:13.365
[Jacopo] Well...

44:14.365 --> 44:16.325
here I am, as you asked.

44:19.925 --> 44:22.005
Pisa has closed its gates to Salviati.

44:22.365 --> 44:25.885
You cannot interfere with the appointment
of an archbishop.

44:26.685 --> 44:28.005
I interfered.

44:30.005 --> 44:32.365
Pisa must open its gates.

44:33.925 --> 44:35.245
Ah, that can be arranged.

44:38.165 --> 44:40.325
I will never vote for the Milan treaty.

44:40.405 --> 44:41.565
Oh, I'm not asking you to.

44:41.645 --> 44:42.765
Then what?

44:46.205 --> 44:49.165
Give your blessing
to Guglielmo and Bianca's union.

44:51.845 --> 44:53.205
You mean you approve?

44:54.485 --> 44:55.925
It's their wish.

44:56.685 --> 44:58.525
Nobody need know that it was not arranged.

45:00.965 --> 45:02.325
You do this...

45:03.765 --> 45:06.365
and I will see that the gates are open
to Salviati.

45:08.405 --> 45:11.045
You blackmail me to benefit your sister

45:11.125 --> 45:13.565
rather than to win approval of the treaty.

45:16.245 --> 45:18.125
Do I choke on the words?

45:20.005 --> 45:21.445
I agree to your terms.

45:23.245 --> 45:25.165
I overestimated you, Medici.

45:25.245 --> 45:28.165
You are too soft-hearted
to be a worthy opponent.

45:29.565 --> 45:31.885
It'll be all too easy to crush you.

45:38.445 --> 45:41.045
You humiliate me and my son.

45:41.165 --> 45:42.085
Look...

45:42.165 --> 45:45.805
you are a friend, and I apologize.

45:46.525 --> 45:47.405
I do.

45:47.485 --> 45:50.085
And I apologize to you, too, Bastiano.

45:52.445 --> 45:54.805
As way of compensation, I...

45:56.445 --> 45:57.405
I have an offer.

45:57.485 --> 45:59.325
You only care about losing
my father's vote

45:59.405 --> 46:00.805
for your stupid treaty.

46:01.165 --> 46:03.285
We have no interest.

46:04.205 --> 46:07.045
So, if the Priori ratify new trade
with Milan...

46:09.485 --> 46:11.605
the Soderini family
will receive half the rights.

46:13.405 --> 46:15.805
All rights... exclusively.

46:15.885 --> 46:16.925
Father!

46:19.165 --> 46:20.885
Is it a deal or not?

46:27.565 --> 46:29.525
-Ow!
-Thank you, Messer.

46:35.405 --> 46:37.525
You have only yourself to blame.

46:40.365 --> 46:42.365
Do you forgive me, Francesco?

46:44.165 --> 46:46.325
Have I ever sided against you?

46:48.325 --> 46:49.405
[footsteps approach]
Uncle?

46:55.245 --> 46:57.205
-Please, let me explain.
-Ah!

46:58.445 --> 46:59.365
It is done.

47:01.205 --> 47:02.725
You will marry the Medici girl.

47:07.165 --> 47:09.765
My decision surprises you. Come.

47:12.565 --> 47:15.205
Did I not take you both into my home

47:15.285 --> 47:17.685
as boys, love you as my own?

47:19.965 --> 47:22.085
It is your choice, Guglielmo.

47:23.285 --> 47:24.565
I have no choice.

47:28.645 --> 47:29.725
I love her.

47:31.205 --> 47:33.325
Then you're no longer a Pazzi.

47:35.605 --> 47:37.285
And know this,

47:38.645 --> 47:41.565
the Medici will destroy
whatever lies between them

47:41.645 --> 47:42.845
and what they desire.

47:42.925 --> 47:45.005
Be it you or this city.

47:47.605 --> 47:49.125
Come, Francesco.

47:51.525 --> 47:53.285
Your brother is beyond help.

47:55.605 --> 47:59.325
Let us at least use our votes
to protect Florence.

48:13.245 --> 48:14.165
What?

48:15.525 --> 48:16.685
You heard me.

48:17.925 --> 48:21.605
You are now officially betrothed
to Guglielmo.

48:33.405 --> 48:35.565
Thank you, Brother. Thank you.

48:50.165 --> 48:54.765
[Petrucci] The Priori have assessed
the proposed new treaty with Milan.

48:55.125 --> 48:56.645
The vote is called.

48:57.205 --> 49:00.645
Gonfaloniere, there are members
of the Priori who are missing.

49:00.725 --> 49:03.565
Bandini and Diviacchi have been
called away on urgent business,

49:03.645 --> 49:04.845
but there is a quorum.

49:05.205 --> 49:07.045
Do we still have enough votes?

49:07.965 --> 49:08.885
No.

49:08.965 --> 49:11.445
Lorenzo de' Medici votes "For".

49:11.525 --> 49:14.125
The other members shall now vote.

49:14.725 --> 49:18.285
I cast mine for the treaty. For Lorenzo.

49:20.605 --> 49:21.565
Against.

49:22.405 --> 49:23.565
For Lorenzo.

49:23.645 --> 49:25.605
My vote is against the treaty.

49:25.685 --> 49:26.845
As is mine.

49:28.325 --> 49:30.685
Two votes "For", three "Against".

49:31.325 --> 49:32.365
Three remain.

49:32.445 --> 49:35.485
For... the treaty and Lorenzo.

49:36.805 --> 49:39.645
That just leaves Jacopo and Francesco,
we're doomed.

49:41.845 --> 49:42.805
Against.

49:43.485 --> 49:45.085
[Petrucci] Three votes in favor.

49:45.165 --> 49:46.645
Four against.

49:46.725 --> 49:48.805
One remains.

50:00.005 --> 50:00.925
Pazzi?

50:03.445 --> 50:04.605
Francesco?

50:08.005 --> 50:09.565
I'm sorry, Uncle.

50:12.805 --> 50:14.045
For.
[people clamoring]

50:20.085 --> 50:20.965
Why?

50:21.045 --> 50:22.725
He is my blood.

50:23.685 --> 50:26.085
If Guglielmo is not a Pazzi,
then nor am I.

50:26.685 --> 50:27.525
[Petrucci] Order.

50:28.525 --> 50:29.525
-[bell dings]
-Order!

50:31.725 --> 50:33.005
There is a draw.

50:33.485 --> 50:37.965
As is customary,
I will cast the final vote.

50:39.645 --> 50:40.725
In favor.

50:40.805 --> 50:42.005
-[man] Yes!
-Oh.

50:42.085 --> 50:43.525
[Petrucci] The treaty is ratified.

50:43.925 --> 50:45.285
[clamoring]

50:58.965 --> 51:01.605
I never thought I'd say this,
Francesco, but thank you.

51:05.045 --> 51:07.085
We are in your debt, Francesco.

51:11.045 --> 51:13.605
Don't flatter yourself.
I didn't vote for you.

51:14.925 --> 51:16.285
I voted for my brother.

51:17.525 --> 51:19.405
Ah, be that as it may...

51:20.445 --> 51:22.045
we're to be family now.
