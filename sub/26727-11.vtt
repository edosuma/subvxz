WEBVTT

00:01.459 --> 00:04.295
SEWING MACHINE CAFE

00:06.673 --> 00:07.590
Done.

00:12.721 --> 00:13.638
Don't worry.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.891
I promise not to give you my blood!

01:52.070 --> 01:54.072
The main computer is in a room
on the second floor.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.324
We can access the ledger
once we boot it up,

01:56.658 --> 01:58.201
but unlocking it will take five minutes.

01:58.409 --> 02:00.495
Making a copy will take
another five minutes.

02:00.745 --> 02:04.833
So, when are we invading
the CCC's hideout?

02:04.999 --> 02:06.334
You're the squad leader.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.878
When do you think will be a good time?

02:10.839 --> 02:12.006
Tonight will do.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.591
The sooner, the better.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.469
If we get noticed, the ledger
will be erased and they'll escape.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.888
Zero-Five was Ushio from Squad C, right?

02:19.347 --> 02:22.517
We'll ask their leader, Takimoto,
to help us control his movements.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.227
I'll stop Kikuhara.

02:24.602 --> 02:27.272
I can't let you storm into their hideout.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.482
We're short on manpower.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.317
So, can you keep watch for us?

02:31.609 --> 02:33.736
Please leave your sniper rifle behind.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.698
You and Jill are under a deployment ban.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.117
If you break it this time,
you'll be fired for sure.

02:39.826 --> 02:40.994
Are only the humans going?

02:41.077 --> 02:42.996
There aren't any vampires in the CCC.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.248
If we're up against humans,
humans will do.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.416
But...

02:46.499 --> 02:48.334
There's a notice from the higher-ups.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.296
You were in danger the other day.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.715
This time, if vampires
break the deployment ban,

02:53.882 --> 02:57.135
if they transform, turn violent,
cause injury, or drink blood,

02:57.302 --> 02:59.888
they will be fired immediately,
regardless of the reason.

03:01.931 --> 03:04.767
And then they will be put
under strict surveillance

03:04.851 --> 03:06.686
and be banned from contact with humans.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.272
What's with that?
Do you all intend to quarantine us?

03:09.480 --> 03:11.816
You'll be placed under watch,
and be banned from meeting,

03:11.900 --> 03:15.361
calling, or e-mailing anyone.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.864
Man, I'm hungry.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.867
Oh, everyone. The food is ready.

03:21.409 --> 03:24.495
Food. And a mountain of it!

03:24.704 --> 03:27.457
Sorry. I was only able
to cook something simple.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.625
It's enough.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.142
Thanks for the meal.

03:48.269 --> 03:51.105
When investigating a guy
who's practically inviting you to do so,

03:51.189 --> 03:53.858
you don't really expect to find anything.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.193
MEGUMI ISHIMARU

04:01.157 --> 04:02.659
Excuse me, Mr. Anzai.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.079
I made this for you.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.914
It's a waist pouch.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.333
You made this?

04:10.541 --> 04:12.835
But it seems like you won't be deployed,

04:12.919 --> 04:15.171
so you don't have to
force yourself to use it.

04:16.297 --> 04:21.469
I just felt that the one from Kano
for your nail protectors may bother you.

04:23.763 --> 04:28.351
If you put them in here,
it might be easier to use them.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.979
Actually, it might be difficult to use.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.023
Oh, Mr. Anzai,

04:35.108 --> 04:36.025
thank you.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.945
I should be the one thanking you.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.405
I mean, I received this from you.

04:40.488 --> 04:41.739
I don't mean that.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.491
How should I put it?

04:45.785 --> 04:48.121
It's for everything you've done for me.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.091
IT'S LATE, BUT MERRY CHRISTMAS

05:19.944 --> 05:21.362
Even if we've been through a lot,

05:21.654 --> 05:23.323
I'm truly...

05:24.490 --> 05:26.367
glad to have been able to meet you.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.750
Me too.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.044
I'm so glad we were able to meet.

05:36.753 --> 05:37.754
Truly glad.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.299
Thank you.

05:41.799 --> 05:42.884
I'll cherish it.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.185
Sawazaki.

05:53.561 --> 05:54.562
I'll go, too.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.731
No way. Definitely not this--

05:56.814 --> 05:59.317
Then, please be on lookout duty.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.443
Ishimaru.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.278
It's just standing watch, anyway.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.198
Mr. Anzai.

06:05.281 --> 06:06.282
It will be fine.

06:07.784 --> 06:08.785
Take care of this for me.

06:12.371 --> 06:15.541
Hey, stay with Tsukasa.
Take care of her for me.

06:15.792 --> 06:16.793
I got it!

06:19.128 --> 06:23.049
Now, we'll invade the CCC's hideout
and obtain the ledger.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.761
Ishimaru and Sawazaki here,
with Asami as backup.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.555
We'll take Zero-Nine to the main computer.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.892
Zero-Seven is on a rooftop
100 meters south of the hideout.

06:34.393 --> 06:36.813
Anzai is on a rooftop 500 meters north.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.731
I'm in position.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.276
Just in case, Yanagi,
be on standby near the hideout.

06:42.693 --> 06:43.611
Understood.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.696
Can you take me with you?

06:46.322 --> 06:47.740
I want to be as close as possible.

06:47.824 --> 06:48.741
Me too!

06:48.908 --> 06:50.159
Hey, Lee! You...

06:51.035 --> 06:53.287
It's time. Let's go.

07:02.964 --> 07:03.965
The stairs.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.552
There was a strange sound.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.513
Let's go.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.275
My condolences.

07:23.067 --> 07:23.985
Wait!

07:26.362 --> 07:28.448
Zero-Seven, can you see the river
at the back?

07:29.282 --> 07:31.659
It's a blind spot! But I heard a splash.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.619
Already dead.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.999
Turns out, the strange noises from earlier
were suppressed gunshots.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.127
Division 5 is using the same bullets.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.504
If that guy was from Division 5,

07:43.963 --> 07:45.882
would he really let us hear his voice?

07:46.007 --> 07:48.426
Well, they're common bullets.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.219
More importantly,
where's the main computer?

07:50.553 --> 07:52.138
The second room from the end.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.391
I guess they're homeless people
who've settled here.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.019
But, the soles of his feet
have soil on them.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.730
If he had been walking around,
the soil would've fallen off.

08:02.190 --> 08:06.694
Homeless people were killed
at the CCC's hideout?

08:07.987 --> 08:09.489
But, why?

08:11.657 --> 08:12.825
Anyway, let's just hurry.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.035
We'll enter the room.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.417
There were three gunshots earlier.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.504
The third shot...

08:25.463 --> 08:26.797
There's no third shot.

08:39.727 --> 08:40.645
A vampire.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.401
Sawazaki.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.947
Sawazaki, what happened?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.617
You and Jill are under a deployment ban.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.953
If you break it this time,
you'll be fired for sure.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.467
Are you okay?

09:11.592 --> 09:13.135
Yes, but I was...

09:14.011 --> 09:14.929
Behind you!

09:17.807 --> 09:19.141
Hey, what...

09:23.604 --> 09:25.106
No way.

09:31.946 --> 09:35.366
Ishimaru here. Five transformed
vampires have appeared.

09:35.658 --> 09:36.576
Five?

09:37.368 --> 09:39.704
There are two bodies in the hallway.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.414
But the vampires are just ignoring them.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.000
The ones in the hallway aren't human.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.043
There's another body.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.087
He was killed by the third bullet.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.297
A human.

09:50.047 --> 09:52.967
It seems like five vampires
ganged up on him and drank his blood.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.136
So, there's just one human?

09:55.469 --> 09:57.972
Then, I'll go save you
without looking at him!

09:58.097 --> 09:59.223
Tell me your exact position!

09:59.599 --> 10:00.766
I'm also bleeding.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.768
Even if I wasn't,

10:03.269 --> 10:05.104
you'll be fired
if your deployment is exposed.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.272
I...

10:23.623 --> 10:26.876
I'll protect all of you!

10:29.253 --> 10:30.504
No, don't come here!

10:30.713 --> 10:32.131
Sawazaki, they're here!

10:33.007 --> 10:34.925
Let's spread them out. I'll go up!

10:35.176 --> 10:36.927
Then, I'll go that way.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.179
Let's go!

10:41.390 --> 10:42.475
Come and get me!

10:44.685 --> 10:45.561
Over here!

10:50.107 --> 10:51.984
They're all attracted to his blood.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.325
Come.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.121
Hang in there!
You can do it in ten minutes, right?

11:07.291 --> 11:10.211
THERE'S A RESPONSE REGARDING
THE THING YOU TALKED ABOUT

11:10.836 --> 11:13.381
Five transformed vampires, all at once.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.842
Mr. Anzai, be careful.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.845
Be very careful.

11:56.006 --> 11:58.926
Sawazaki is on the third floor.
There are two vampires over there.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.053
If you don't hurry, he'll be killed.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.392
His wound has closed up.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.186
Was it because of my blood
when he bit me earlier?

12:55.983 --> 12:56.901
Anzai.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.029
If you weren't here,

13:01.238 --> 13:02.406
I would be dead.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.498
I should have killed them.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.375
I...

13:16.670 --> 13:18.005
Where's Zero-Nine?

13:18.589 --> 13:22.134
He's getting the ledger.
I made him lock the door, it will be fine.

13:22.927 --> 13:23.928
But first of all,

13:24.595 --> 13:25.930
in your resume,

13:26.138 --> 13:29.350
it was written that you were in Squad W
for five years before joining Squad A.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.477
I used my connections in Division 5

13:31.810 --> 13:34.396
to question the people who were
in Squad W during that time.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.149
They said it's true
that there was a Megumi Ishimaru.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.945
But only for a year.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.370
Emergency message for Public Safety
Division 5 Squads L through N!

13:50.663 --> 13:52.748
We received a report
that several armed officers

13:52.998 --> 13:54.750
are vampire hunting
in an abandoned building

13:54.833 --> 13:56.001
at Hirumi 2-6, Koto Ward.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.215
Officers from the 2A2B jurisdiction
will arrive there shortly.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.425
Yanagi, please retreat.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.178
What happened? They mentioned something
about hunting vampires!

14:06.595 --> 14:08.764
I'm not sure,
but it looks like it was all just a trap.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.308
Then, how can we retreat alone?

14:12.184 --> 14:13.185
Mr. Anzai.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.731
Seven homeless vampires
and a homeless human were taken away.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.734
Three of them died
from bullets used by Division 5.

14:20.901 --> 14:24.238
The armed Squad F was at the scene
and had lured them inside.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.116
That is how the story will go.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.827
Won't they get it if we explained?

14:30.035 --> 14:31.537
The "vampire hunting" is not true!

14:31.787 --> 14:35.207
The fact that we're tied with Zero-Seven
and Zero-Nine will come out.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.294
We will be out of the investigation
immediately.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.839
Is that why we were made
to raid this place?

14:42.256 --> 14:43.591
I have no idea.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.594
It was you who wanted to break in today--

14:46.677 --> 14:47.928
I didn't say anything!

14:48.762 --> 14:53.100
Jason didn't report today's plans.

15:03.611 --> 15:07.281
What are these tears for?

15:09.950 --> 15:11.785
You said Jason, right?

15:11.994 --> 15:14.663
I am Thirteen, also known as "Jason."

15:15.122 --> 15:17.207
You were right. Well, good for you.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.378
Am I supposed to be happy?
What were you after?

15:21.545 --> 15:24.131
Well, the guy who shot a vampire
and ran away

15:24.298 --> 15:27.134
was probably a subordinate of Kikuhara.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.304
We might have been monitored all along.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.934
I didn't think they would be able
to formulate a plan this disturbing.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.520
In a situation like this,
it's normal for the ledger to be erased.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.190
But Zero-Nine is making a copy now!

15:41.398 --> 15:43.984
That's right. There was a ledger.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.863
I joined the CCC in order to find them,

15:49.323 --> 15:51.575
as an undercover agent.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.411
The group I really belong to is

15:54.745 --> 15:58.582
the Public Safety General Affairs,
Investigation Division 6, Section 11.

15:59.333 --> 16:04.588
Also, the one who left the ledger for us
was another undercover agent.

16:05.089 --> 16:09.009
Like me, he joined the CCC.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.845
It's Makimura.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.098
What are you doing?

16:14.765 --> 16:17.351
I'm turning you in to headquarters.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.812
Turn me in? You?

16:20.354 --> 16:22.106
You're a suspect
for the Bar Cross murders.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.357
They'll arrest you as well.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.900
I'll turn myself in, too.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.070
During the investigation
conducted by Squad E,

16:28.529 --> 16:32.783
a gun and a bullet with the manager's
fingerprints were found at Bar Cross.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.328
There was also gunpowder residue
on the manager's right hand.

16:36.954 --> 16:37.830
Go outside!

16:38.330 --> 16:41.500
I suspect Makimura was trying
to help everyone get away.

16:41.959 --> 16:45.921
That probably made the manager
suspicious of him instead.

16:46.797 --> 16:47.881
Hurry up and do it!

16:48.132 --> 16:51.635
She had a gun meant for self-defense
and shot first.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.892
Then what about the staff member?

16:59.309 --> 17:00.310
She committed suicide.

17:01.353 --> 17:05.691
It's a common case among vampires
who have witnessed fatal injuries.

17:06.608 --> 17:10.362
When someone they care about
bleeds a lot in front of them,

17:11.030 --> 17:13.532
they're so afraid to lose their senses
that they commit suicide.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.284
Stop!

17:16.702 --> 17:20.456
Makimura is also an undercover agent
like Ishimaru?

17:21.832 --> 17:24.251
Come with me. I'm turning you in.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.138
How funny.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.183
Anzai here. There are patrol cars below.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.394
It's not just the riot squad.
Even the media seems to be here.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.064
It's just an instinct,

17:46.148 --> 17:48.609
but I have a feeling this trap
has another purpose.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.861
If only the ledger was needed,

17:51.153 --> 17:54.364
Makimura could've just taken
the computer away.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.201
But that wouldn't have been enough.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.496
The ledgers are basically
accounting information.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.039
In other words, the cash flow.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.792
It only lists the members
who have financial connections.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.462
Is there an unknown person
using the ledger?

18:09.296 --> 18:11.799
Who's behind the CCC?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.510
Initially, I thought Zero-One
was the mastermind.

18:15.260 --> 18:19.890
A self-righteous politician
or government official, at most.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.975
But that doesn't seem to be the case!

18:22.726 --> 18:23.894
It's something bigger.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.563
For example, the R2PC,

18:26.897 --> 18:29.650
or the Ministry of Health, Labor,
and Welfare.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.777
Maybe causing a huge uproar

18:31.902 --> 18:34.321
was Makimura's goal all along.

18:34.738 --> 18:38.117
So, he called the police
and media over for that?

18:39.368 --> 18:40.869
You did something unnecessary.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.080
No matter how much trouble you cause,

18:43.413 --> 18:46.583
or even if you manage
to get everyone to notice the CCC,

18:46.834 --> 18:48.669
you can't solve the real problem.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.839
I let Squad F and Section 11
run around freely

18:52.631 --> 18:55.134
because I was betting on a chance

18:55.592 --> 18:58.595
that they might find the truth
behind this matter.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.099
But it seems like
I expected too much from them.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.727
It's not the Ministry of Health, Labor,
and Welfare?

19:05.894 --> 19:08.772
Or is there still something else...

19:13.026 --> 19:14.862
You think you can solve the problem

19:14.987 --> 19:18.073
by chopping off the head
instead of the tail?

19:19.032 --> 19:22.369
But this lizard can regrow even its head.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.538
If you mow the grass
while leaving the roots in,

19:24.621 --> 19:26.456
it will just grow back.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.127
The roots are under the soil
where the eye can't see.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.880
So, you can't even remove or control them.

19:33.297 --> 19:37.426
Most of all, they all come together
to form one giant grassland.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.345
This huge, uncontrollable,

19:41.221 --> 19:43.098
shared consciousness

19:44.141 --> 19:45.350
that forms society's roots.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.019
That is,

19:47.561 --> 19:50.606
the shared idea
that vampires are dangerous.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.607
VAMPIRES SHOULD DIE

19:51.690 --> 19:53.692
Since this shared idea exists,

19:53.984 --> 19:55.569
even if you crush the CCC,

19:55.819 --> 19:58.572
someone else will just be forced
to play the same role again.

19:58.822 --> 20:02.117
That's why I intentionally continue
to stay within these limits

20:02.201 --> 20:05.454
and use the CCC
to oppose those at the top.

20:05.746 --> 20:09.499
You can't achieve anything
by killing people.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.460
Our chat has gone on for too long.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.420
Everything will be over soon,

20:13.587 --> 20:15.422
once I end things here.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.469
Still there? That little...

20:31.813 --> 20:32.898
One down.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.568
Anzai has been shot!

20:36.902 --> 20:39.321
On the roof! He's been shot!

20:39.571 --> 20:41.406
Anzai?

20:41.782 --> 20:43.408
Anzai. Hey, Anzai!

20:50.040 --> 20:53.543
Am I going to die?

20:59.132 --> 21:01.551
Anzai, can you hear me? Anzai!

21:01.677 --> 21:02.594
Freeze!

21:03.345 --> 21:05.847
Hey, Anzai! Answer me!

21:07.224 --> 21:09.893
This is bad.
If it stays like this, he'll die.

21:10.852 --> 21:14.940
If they transform, turn violent,
cause injury, or drink blood...

21:15.399 --> 21:16.984
Hurry and call an ambulance!

21:17.150 --> 21:19.736
I know! But whether it will come
in time is...

21:21.780 --> 21:26.743
...they will be fired immediately,
regardless of the reason.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.124
Taira!

21:34.126 --> 21:35.460
Lee, come on!

21:38.714 --> 21:41.466
Take me to Mr. Anzai!

23:27.155 --> 23:28.323
Devil's Line.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.033
Line 12.

23:30.826 --> 23:31.827
Devil's Line.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.995
