25:49.840 --> 25:51.800
Dad? Mum?

25:52.840 --> 25:54.200
- Hi.
- This is Aaron.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.400
- Good to meet you, Aaron.
- Nice to meet you too.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.880
- I'm Michael.
- Hi, Michael.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.120
- Charlotte.
- This is for you.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.240
Oh. How sweet.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.120
[Charlotte] Oh.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.040
- Wine?
- Yeah. Thanks.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.720
So do you need help with anything,
'cause...

26:12.800 --> 26:14.440
- He's got it.
- We're good.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.600
- [Abby] Come, let's go to the garden.
- See ya.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.280
Whoa.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.640
- Is there more at the back?
- Yeah.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.120
- [Aaron] This is bare nice, you know.
- [Abby chuckles]

26:41.200 --> 26:43.120
[Abby] Dad says it's more trouble
than it's worth.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.600
- You could've told me they were posh.
- We're not posh.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.320
[Abby] Sorry. Don't hold it against me.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.640
[Aaron] What do they do again?

26:49.720 --> 26:51.560
[Abby] Dad's a surgeon.
Mum's an interior designer.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.680
- [Aaron] Wow.
- [Abby] What? It's not a big deal.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.160
[Aaron] You don't think that's posh?

26:55.240 --> 26:57.440
- [Abby] Okay, maybe a little bit posh.
- [Aaron] Exactly.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.640
[Abby chuckles]

27:00.480 --> 27:01.960
[ambient music playing]

27:17.040 --> 27:18.840

27:26.160 --> 27:28.080
[Kit] Get out of the fucking lift, man.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.840

27:34.760 --> 27:36.240

27:36.320 --> 27:38.040

27:41.920 --> 27:43.600
[Kit] Get on the fucking floor, man.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.360
Fucking idiot.

27:54.520 --> 27:55.480
[Cam] Ay, what?

27:55.920 --> 27:56.960
Fuck you!

27:57.280 --> 27:58.200
[Cam spits]

27:58.520 --> 27:59.480
What?

27:59.680 --> 28:01.640
This is for Tilly, you fuckin' pussy.

28:01.720 --> 28:03.440
[all clamouring]

28:03.520 --> 28:05.000
[all grunting]

28:22.760 --> 28:23.800
[laughter]

28:24.240 --> 28:26.000
Aaron's smashin' it. Top of his class.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.280
He's gonna launch a startup
when he graduates, aren't you?

28:28.360 --> 28:30.800
- Really?
- Yeah, um, that's the plan.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.760
If I can get the seed money together.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.320
That's exciting. In what field?

28:35.720 --> 28:36.920
Er, branded content.

28:37.920 --> 28:40.240
- Oh.
- So I produce photos,

28:40.440 --> 28:42.920
videos for brands' social media.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.680
And what do your parents do?

28:45.160 --> 28:47.280
Oh... Well, they're, sort of...

28:47.360 --> 28:49.360
Aaron's parents passed away.

28:50.440 --> 28:51.720
Oh, I'm sorry.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.360
[Charlotte] When?

28:53.680 --> 28:55.040
Uh, four years ago.

28:57.240 --> 28:59.320
Yeah, Dad came down with this cough,

28:59.400 --> 29:00.280
and, uh...

29:01.320 --> 29:02.800
he went to go get it checked out.

29:03.320 --> 29:05.040
They said he had pulmonary cancer.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.320
Yeah, they said he probably had it
for years without even realising.

29:10.160 --> 29:14.080
And a few months later,
Mum had some abdominal pains.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.280
Went to get it checked out.

29:16.560 --> 29:19.920
They said she had stage 4
metastatic pancreatic cancer.

29:22.680 --> 29:24.960
Yeah, it had already spread to her stomach
and to her liver,

29:25.040 --> 29:27.080
so she went down pretty quick.

29:30.480 --> 29:31.720
I'm so sorry.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.960
Yeah. We tried to help at home, but...

29:36.920 --> 29:38.600
my dad was in bed by then too.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.160
So, they had them both moved
to the hospice.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.480
Yeah, um...

29:44.000 --> 29:46.560
They had beds next to each other, though,
so they could hold hands.

29:48.280 --> 29:51.520
And Dad died on a Sunday.
Mum died on a Tuesday.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.800
Well, who's been looking after you?

29:55.440 --> 29:56.800
My older brother. Jamie.

29:57.800 --> 30:01.320
Um, he'd just turned 18 when they died
so he became my legal guardian,

30:01.960 --> 30:02.840
for me and Stef.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.800
Stef's Aaron's younger brother.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.040
Yeah.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.120
See, Stef was kinda young
when it all happened,

30:08.200 --> 30:11.720
so he didn't really understand everything,
but Jamie was really good with him.

30:12.480 --> 30:13.560
He was good with both of us.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.240
I mean, he made sure
we always went to school.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.200
Never missed a meal.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.080
Yeah. He'd do anything for us.

30:23.880 --> 30:27.760
Well, I think your brother Jamie
sounds like a remarkable young man.

30:27.840 --> 30:28.680
[Michael] Hm.

30:29.040 --> 30:29.880

30:44.280 --> 30:45.240

32:04.240 --> 32:07.080
Listen, that's you.
But don't put it all in your fucking arm.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.280
I won't. No, I won't, I won't.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.520
I'm gonna need you when we come back
to set up another shop.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.760

32:16.880 --> 32:18.600

- You're good, my guy.

32:23.160 --> 32:26.120

32:26.200 --> 32:27.760
About enough to rent a yard.

32:35.840 --> 32:36.920
Somewhere with a hot shower,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.640
'cause I ain't felt fucking clean

32:39.720 --> 32:41.480

32:41.760 --> 32:43.880
- Yeah, right after we beat.
- For real?

32:44.800 --> 32:46.560
What, you ain't got no woman
waiting for you?

32:46.640 --> 32:49.680
A woman waiting for me? Nah, man.
I'm not into all that, man.

32:50.560 --> 32:51.440
You're not into women?

32:51.520 --> 32:54.040
Nah. I'm into women,
but it's the relationships.

32:54.120 --> 32:56.880
I just think they're so long,
getting tied down and that, man.

32:57.160 --> 33:01.280
Don't worry, when we get back,

33:01.520 --> 33:02.720

Where from?

44:16.880 --> 44:19.000
You ain't gonna be keeping shit
from me again.

44:21.400 --> 44:22.560
I ain't less than you.

44:26.880 --> 44:27.880
Jamaica.

44:30.880 --> 44:33.760
We can get as much as we can move
if we do this one right.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.240
What's the split?

44:39.480 --> 44:40.840
Fifty-fifty.

44:41.200 --> 44:42.480
Us and the supplier.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.040
If we do this right, bro,

45:10.320 --> 45:11.320
we're back on top.

45:13.840 --> 45:16.920
No more of that fucking around
on the street corners and them shit.

45:17.680 --> 45:18.600
Me and you.

45:20.320 --> 45:21.480
Equal partners.

45:24.760 --> 45:27.000
Listen, Dushane,
this is how it's gonna work.

45:28.480 --> 45:30.640
This first shipment, two-to-one my favour.

45:30.720 --> 45:33.280
- Bruv, you can't do...
- You need my money or not?

45:36.040 --> 45:36.920
Hm?

45:38.880 --> 45:41.360
And everything after that,
down the middle.

46:07.320 --> 46:09.400
Bro, are you gonna tell me
what the fuck happened?

46:10.040 --> 46:11.120
What's goin' on?

46:16.600 --> 46:18.040
Sully, where's Jason?

46:20.800 --> 46:21.880
He didn't make it.

46:23.320 --> 46:24.640
I'm sorry to hear that.

46:27.320 --> 46:28.960
That kid never had no luck.

46:34.680 --> 46:35.680
Ready.

46:49.440 --> 46:52.680
- You gonna disappoint me?
- Depends what you're hopin' for, innit?

47:02.320 --> 47:04.440
Why does this smell like
a fucking bonfire?

47:04.880 --> 47:06.040
Bruv, it's all there.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.440
You can count it if you want, you know.

47:11.440 --> 47:13.080
You was hoping it wasn't, innit?

47:14.160 --> 47:16.760
If you fuck up,
it makes me look bad in Sugar's eyes.

47:16.840 --> 47:18.440
That's not a healthy situation.

47:18.840 --> 47:21.600
So you need to pay Sugar
what you promised him. You understand?

47:23.160 --> 47:25.120
Yeah. I think I get it.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.320
[Haze] Next time, it'll be double that.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.400
You told Sugar he's gettin' serious money.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.640
Serious money's what he's expectin'.

47:53.640 --> 47:54.880
[Dushane] That's what we'll send him.

47:56.400 --> 47:58.680
And we'll make sure
you look good in Sugar's eyes, yeah?

47:59.440 --> 48:00.600
[chuckles]

48:08.280 --> 48:09.640
[engine starts]

48:15.840 --> 48:18.520
- [Sully] Bruv, who the fuck's Sugar?
- I'll tell you later.

48:24.560 --> 48:25.640
[Dushane] Good, yeah?

48:37.720 --> 48:38.560
Yeah.

48:39.360 --> 48:40.240
Good.
