-ALL: No.
-Do women wait

16:55.891 --> 16:56.892
-Heck, no!
-Hell, no.

-Do women molest their daughters?
-No!

-Do women pervert art

No.

17:27.464 --> 17:28.924
VALERIE: Talk doesn't work with men.

17:29.007 --> 17:32.886
The only way to win is to anti-assimilate
and play their game.

17:32.970 --> 17:36.348
To do to them what they have been
doing to us since the dawn of time.

17:36.431 --> 17:40.519
This planet will not move forward
until we get our hands bloody

17:40.602 --> 17:42.855
and murder every fuckin' man on it!

17:42.938 --> 17:45.524
I've got a few I'd like to shove
to the front of the damn line.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.901
That's the spirit, Martha.

17:58.370 --> 18:01.915
SCUM stands for

18:01.999 --> 18:05.127
Our goal is to kill all men

18:09.882 --> 18:11.925
These include little limp-wristers

who by shining,

flaming example, encourage other men
to de-man themselves.

18:19.558 --> 18:24.688
Any man present must give a speech

18:25.898 --> 18:29.943
I am a turd, a lowly abject turd.

18:30.027 --> 18:31.987
And why should we let you stay, turd?

18:32.070 --> 18:33.947
Because men have hurt me, too.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.574
Rejected me.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.160
Raped me in the showers in the barracks.

Fine, gender-traitor,

19:26.792 --> 19:29.211
Yeah, but wars need martyrs.

19:32.923 --> 19:34.967
And they need to be loud.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.302
We need to make them face
their greatest fear,

their pussy envy, and we need to do it

19:39.263 --> 19:41.765
in the only language

19:41.849 --> 19:43.100

VALERIE: It's not just men

19:54.611 --> 19:56.029

19:56.113 --> 19:59.157
It's women who think that by

they gain value.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.786
They're lost.

All murders ascribed

And just as many of them were women.

What did I say? The plan was
to start with couple-busting.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.650
To send the message to women

22:38.734 --> 22:41.570
that coupling with men
would only get them killed.

one that I think will surprise
many of the people here tonight.

26:47.065 --> 26:49.067

I just drove my wife crazy.
I didn't get her killed!

41:36.455 --> 41:37.873
(BREATH TREMBLING)

41:37.956 --> 41:39.583
Her death

41:39.666 --> 41:43.712
had more meaning than any moment
in her pathetic life.

41:44.254 --> 41:45.589
And you know that.

41:46.381 --> 41:47.716
And this is all Kai!

41:48.050 --> 41:49.176
Kai's the genius!

41:49.259 --> 41:50.761
He's the author of everything!

WINTER: What about Men Lead, Women Bleed?

41:52.721 --> 41:55.390
-You came up with that.
-What? No, I didn't.

41:55.474 --> 41:57.100
Even if you just said it to impress

41:57.184 --> 41:59.603
your new SS-wannabe boyfriends,
it's disgusting.

41:59.686 --> 42:00.854
I never said it!

42:00.938 --> 42:02.648
BEVERLY: Now would be the time to deny it.

42:02.856 --> 42:04.733
Not that we would ever believe you.

42:05.442 --> 42:08.529
You of all people know what
it's like to be marginalized,

42:08.654 --> 42:09.780
pushed out.

42:09.905 --> 42:12.115
You're a gay man.

42:12.199 --> 42:13.867
-I'm a man!
-(SAW WHIRRING)

42:13.951 --> 42:15.827
-And we are SCUM!
-No!

(HARRISON SCREAMING)

42:20.874 --> 42:22.793
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

42:22.876 --> 42:24.545
Put him out of his misery.

42:25.045 --> 42:26.713
HARRISON: No!

42:39.893 --> 42:41.895
