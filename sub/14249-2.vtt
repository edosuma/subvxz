00:02.535 --> 00:07.471
First Officer's Personal Log,
Stardate 49005.3.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.770
The Captain has granted me
the use of a shuttlecraft

00:09.843 --> 00:12.641
so that l may perform
the pakra-- a solitary ritual

00:12.712 --> 00:15.806
commemorating the anniversary
of my father's death.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:44.411 --> 00:46.345
A-koo-chee-moya.

00:48.348 --> 00:51.044
l pray on this day of memories

00:51.117 --> 00:53.449
to speak to my father--

00:53.520 --> 00:58.981
the one whom the wind
called... Kolopak.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.586
Though l am far from his bones,

01:02.662 --> 01:05.221
perhaps there is a spirit
in these unnamed skies

01:05.298 --> 01:09.428
who will find him
and honor him with my song.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.106
A-koo-chee-moya.

01:22.549 --> 01:24.642
There. You see?

01:26.352 --> 01:27.876
We should teach them the price

01:27.954 --> 01:30.115
of displaying their markings
in our space.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.885
l'll go.

01:31.958 --> 01:33.084
Let Kar do it this time.

01:33.159 --> 01:34.558
He's not ready.

01:34.627 --> 01:35.559
He thinks he is.

01:35.628 --> 01:36.993
He's been demanding
a chance for weeks

01:37.063 --> 01:38.394
to earn his name.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.456
Do you really believe
he could do this?

01:40.533 --> 01:43.001
Can you honestly say
you knew you were ready

01:43.069 --> 01:45.094
for your first mission, Haliz?

01:45.171 --> 01:47.969
Tell him.

01:48.041 --> 01:51.568
Tell him today is the day
he will finally be called Ogla.

02:07.594 --> 02:08.788
Computer, report.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.056
The shuttlecraft
has sustained phaser fire.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.928
Minor damage to aft shields.

02:13.032 --> 02:14.226
Source?

02:14.300 --> 02:18.760
A Kazon spacecraft,
closing at 195, mark 6.

02:29.015 --> 02:31.677
Computer, open a channel
to the Kazon vessel.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.981
This is Commander Chakotay

02:34.087 --> 02:35.987
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

02:36.089 --> 02:37.920
Why have you fired on me?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.619
You are in Kazon-Ogla space,
Federation.

02:40.693 --> 02:42.422
l wasn't aware of that.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.826
l have no hostile intentions.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.626
Power down your weapons
and l'll leave.

02:45.698 --> 02:48.360
No one who violates
Ogla space leaves.

02:48.434 --> 02:52.370
Look, son, my starship is
only a few light-years away.

02:52.438 --> 02:54.167
l am not your son, Federation.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.571
l am your executioner.

04:46.085 --> 04:47.950
Chakotay to Kazon vessel.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.579
Listen carefully.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.647
l do not want a fight.

04:51.724 --> 04:54.420
Stand down, or l'll be forced
to return fire.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.044
Chakotay to Kazon vessel.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.052
l have established

05:22.121 --> 05:23.918
a direct weapons lock
on your engine core.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.423
This is my final warning.

05:25.491 --> 05:29.552
lf you don't stand down,
l will destroy your ship.

05:34.767 --> 05:35.734
All right.

05:35.802 --> 05:37.929
lf that's the way
you want to play it.

05:46.879 --> 05:49.939
Chakotay to Kazon vessel.
Do you read me?

05:50.016 --> 05:52.280
Computer,
are there any life signs

05:52.352 --> 05:53.512
inside the Kazon vessel?

05:53.586 --> 05:55.850
Affirmative. One life sign.

05:55.922 --> 05:58.652
Kazon ship,
your engine core is critical.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.818
You have less
than 30 seconds to evacuate.

06:00.893 --> 06:01.791
Do you read me?

06:02.862 --> 06:05.456
lf you have an escape pod,
you must eject now.

06:08.968 --> 06:09.957
Computer,

06:10.036 --> 06:12.630
establish a transporter lock
on the life-form.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.003
Acknowledged.
Targeting scanners.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.099
Prepare to beam him aboard.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.609
Scanners locked.

06:18.678 --> 06:19.610
Energize.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.586
Chakotay to Voyager.

06:37.630 --> 06:40.224
Chakotay to Voyager.

06:40.299 --> 06:43.132
Computer, damage report.

06:43.202 --> 06:46.171
Long-range communications,
lateral sensor array

06:46.239 --> 06:48.571
and aft shields are off-line.

06:48.641 --> 06:50.074
Great!

06:51.677 --> 06:53.872
Welcome aboard.

07:05.491 --> 07:08.187
lt's not that l feel

07:08.261 --> 07:10.058
that l'm not
making contributions

07:10.129 --> 07:12.563
as chef and morale officer.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.328
You're making significant
contributions, Neelix.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.528
Well, if you insist, but...

07:17.603 --> 07:19.070
l can't imagine
how Lieutenant Ayala

07:19.138 --> 07:22.505
would be handling the separation
from his children without you.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.305
He misses his boys terribly.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.539
l wish l could do more for him.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.911
And your meals
are getting to be...

07:29.982 --> 07:31.449
Yes?

07:31.517 --> 07:33.849
Almost certainly...

07:33.920 --> 07:36.388
a highlight of every day.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.890
Oh, Captain!

07:38.958 --> 07:41.392
You always know
how to touch one's heart.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.826
Thank you.

07:42.895 --> 07:45.261
When l signed on,

07:45.331 --> 07:46.855
l promised you that...

07:49.268 --> 07:52.465
l promised you
that l would stand by your side

07:52.538 --> 07:55.200
through every danger
this Quadrant has to offer--

07:55.274 --> 07:58.732
as guide, as strategist,
as explorer, as adventurer...

07:58.811 --> 07:59.971
Yes?

08:02.381 --> 08:04.474
l feel...

08:04.550 --> 08:07.542
under-utilized.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.714
l can swashbuckle
with the best of them.

08:10.790 --> 08:11.848
You weren't invited

08:11.924 --> 08:14.449
to the holodeck
defense simulations, were you?

08:14.527 --> 08:15.516
No!

08:15.595 --> 08:16.857
Captain, you are needed
on the Bridge.

08:16.929 --> 08:17.861
On my way.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.262
l'll see to it
you're invited next time.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.860
And now, Mr. Neelix, please--
join me on the Bridge.

08:23.936 --> 08:25.301
Yes, sir.

08:25.371 --> 08:27.066
Ma'am... Captain.

08:29.141 --> 08:30.199
We are ready to depart.

08:30.276 --> 08:32.244
However, Commander Chakotay
has still not returned.

08:32.311 --> 08:33.335
Have you tried hailing him?

08:33.412 --> 08:35.903
On all frequencies.
No response.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.506
When was the last time
we heard from him?

08:37.582 --> 08:39.015
More than six hours ago.

08:45.057 --> 08:47.457
Well, according to his
flight plan, he's not far.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.290
We'll just have to go get him.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.296
l want all away teams
back on board now.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.592
Mr. Paris, plot a course

08:52.665 --> 08:54.257
for Chakotay's
last known coordinates.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.300
Aye, Captain.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.111
What am l doing here?

09:13.319 --> 09:14.718
You're welcome.

09:14.787 --> 09:15.845
What?

09:15.922 --> 09:17.287
lt's a human expression.

09:17.356 --> 09:19.654
You thank me for saving
your life, l say,

09:19.725 --> 09:20.851
''You're welcome.''

09:26.032 --> 09:27.761
l accept your surrender.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.858
Look!

09:30.002 --> 09:32.300
l promise you, as soon
as we get back to Voyager,

09:32.371 --> 09:34.669
we'll find a Kazon ship
and hand you over to them.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.207
You should have let me die.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.440
l'm not in the habit
of killing children.

09:42.515 --> 09:47.077
Warning. Alien vessel
approaching at 022 mark 8.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.784
What's your name, son?

09:51.857 --> 09:52.915
What?

09:52.992 --> 09:54.323
Your name?

09:54.393 --> 09:56.327
Why do you want to know my name?

09:56.395 --> 09:58.795
l want to let them know
you're on board.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.398
l'm called Kar.

10:05.471 --> 10:08.599
Computer, open a channel.

10:10.309 --> 10:13.335
Kazon vessel, l have

10:13.412 --> 10:15.880
a young man on board
you might know.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.643
He goes by the name of Kar.

10:17.717 --> 10:20.345
l'd say he's about 13.

10:20.419 --> 10:22.979
l'd like to arrange
for his transfer

10:23.055 --> 10:24.386
before l return to my ship.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.992
Computer, confirm
channel is open.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.996
Confirmed.
Transmission has been received.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.233
Talk to them.
Tell them you're okay.

10:38.437 --> 10:42.396
Warning. Kazon vessel
has engaged a tractor beam.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.375
Full reverse.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.035
Unable to comply.

10:46.112 --> 10:49.081
Tractor force exceeds
available engine power.

10:50.416 --> 10:51.849
They're pulling us in.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.817
Kill me.

10:57.456 --> 10:58.923
Please!

11:03.596 --> 11:05.325
Why are you so eager
for me to kill you?

11:07.967 --> 11:10.834
Because there are worse things
than being killed by your enemy.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.147
Look, if you check
your long-range sensors,

11:28.220 --> 11:29.881
you'll find a big ship
out there.

11:29.955 --> 11:31.445
lt's called Voyager,

11:31.524 --> 11:33.492
and by now,
it's on its way to find me.

11:33.559 --> 11:34.526
Kar.

11:34.593 --> 11:36.891
l told Razik you weren't ready.

11:36.962 --> 11:39.726
l have a fair idea
of why l'm here,

11:39.799 --> 11:41.198
but why are they
doing this to you?

11:41.267 --> 11:42.996
l was ready, Haliz.

11:43.135 --> 11:45.160
Ready to kill or die.

11:45.237 --> 11:47.034
l felt the flames touch my skin.

11:47.106 --> 11:49.870
Go back in, Kar.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.377
lt was this fool--

11:58.451 --> 12:00.681
this... Federation,

12:00.753 --> 12:03.586
who doesn't even have
the courage to kill his enemies.

12:03.656 --> 12:04.680
He pulled me out

12:04.757 --> 12:06.748
with that transporter
we've heard about.

12:12.598 --> 12:16.398
Like the Nistrim
and the Relora before you...

12:16.469 --> 12:17.629
you come into our space,

12:17.703 --> 12:19.694
showing off your uniforms

12:19.772 --> 12:23.105
and displaying the markings
of your... Federation

12:23.175 --> 12:28.169
with no respect, as if you
own this part of space.

12:29.648 --> 12:31.479
But it belongs to us!

12:36.789 --> 12:38.120
l tried to kill him, Haliz!

12:43.863 --> 12:45.831
l want to see Razik.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.701
Tell Razik l demand to see him.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.807
Who's Razik?

12:58.344 --> 12:59.675
You tell this Razik

12:59.745 --> 13:02.407
that Federation Commander
Chakotay demands to see him.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.107
What are you doing?

13:05.751 --> 13:07.912
Razik is obviously your leader.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.045
l'm hoping if he's strong
enough to be in command,

13:10.122 --> 13:11.783
he's wise enough
to listen to reason.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.489
You see this?

13:18.564 --> 13:20.930
This is debris
from a Nistrim frigate.

13:21.033 --> 13:23.661
The man you are demanding to see
destroyed it,

13:23.736 --> 13:26.068
killing more than 100
in a single shot.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.902
Before that,
his name was only Ra.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.465
Now he is called Jal Razik.

13:32.511 --> 13:35.605
And this tunic belonged
to a Relora warrior.

13:35.681 --> 13:38.206
He was killed by the bare hands

13:38.284 --> 13:41.082
of another Ogla,
called only Hali.

13:41.153 --> 13:44.179
Now that man is
called Jal Haliz,

13:44.256 --> 13:45.917
one of our greatest fighters.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.720
And this bracelet belonged

13:47.793 --> 13:49.590
to the man
who killed my brother.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.325
My brother, Jal Kinell...

13:53.399 --> 13:57.927
who earned his Ogla name
by dying bravely in battle.

13:58.003 --> 14:02.770
But l... l will never earn
my name in life or in death,

14:02.842 --> 14:05.606
and l have you
to thank for that.

14:15.654 --> 14:18.589
We're approaching Chakotay's
last known coordinates, Captain.

14:18.657 --> 14:21.023
All stop.
Full sensor scan, Mr. Kim.

14:23.429 --> 14:24.726
l'm picking up floating debris

14:24.797 --> 14:28.392
composed of duranium, magnesite
and electroceramics.

14:28.467 --> 14:30.628
Also heavy traces
of carbon residue.

14:31.670 --> 14:32.796
Bridge to Engineering.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.340
Prepare to receive debris
samples for analysis.

14:35.407 --> 14:36.339
Aye, Captain.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.268
Transport complete.

14:40.512 --> 14:41.979
Captain, l am detecting

14:42.047 --> 14:44.709
an ion trail leading away
from this location.

14:44.783 --> 14:46.080
Chakotay's shuttle?

14:46.151 --> 14:47.948
The signature of the radiation
is not consistent

14:48.020 --> 14:50.250
with Federation
propulsion systems.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.790
So what are we saying here?

14:52.858 --> 14:55.486
That someone blew up Chakotay's
shuttle and then took off?

14:55.561 --> 14:57.620
That's speculation, Mr. Paris,

14:57.696 --> 14:59.721
but that trail's
the only clue we have

14:59.798 --> 15:01.425
to Chakotay's whereabouts.

15:02.434 --> 15:03.867
Laying in a course.

15:03.969 --> 15:05.163
Engage.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.750
Hello, Kar.

15:28.961 --> 15:31.361
l never thought l would
see you like this.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.522
lt was not my fault.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.826
lt was his technology.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.332
Don't make excuses, Kar.

15:37.403 --> 15:40.372
An Ogla has no room for excuses.

15:41.573 --> 15:44.508
No. No excuses.

15:44.576 --> 15:46.635
l forgive you.

15:46.712 --> 15:48.475
Know that in your heart.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.250
No, please...

16:02.828 --> 16:05.592
You will eat
at my right hand tonight.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.658
Why did you save him?

16:10.736 --> 16:14.001
lt's a very ineffective
way of waging war.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.007
l'm not at war with you.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.771
l wish l could say the same.

16:18.844 --> 16:20.675
We're not familiar
with this part of space.

16:20.746 --> 16:24.580
lf l'd seen a map identifying
this as Kazon-Ogla territory,

16:24.650 --> 16:26.777
l wouldn't have been
anywhere near it.

16:26.852 --> 16:31.118
Unfortunately, our territorial
claims change every day.

16:31.190 --> 16:34.421
Maps do not serve us well.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.929
You did him a great disservice,
you know.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.589
l guess if he had killed me,

16:39.665 --> 16:42.395
my uniform would have made
you all a fine trophy.

16:42.468 --> 16:45.528
Your uniform may yet
decorate our wall.

16:45.604 --> 16:48.630
You may not think
you're at war with us,

16:48.707 --> 16:50.971
Federation Commander Chakotay,

16:51.043 --> 16:54.137
but everything you are
is a threat to us.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.805
The Kazon fought long and hard

16:55.881 --> 16:58.782
for their independence
from uniforms like yours.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.514
Uniforms, maybe,
but not like mine.

17:02.588 --> 17:07.820
Your uniforms,
your laws, your technology.

17:07.893 --> 17:09.656
You are not welcome here.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.497
Get him something to eat.

17:16.568 --> 17:18.866
The execution is tonight.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.619
Well?

17:36.688 --> 17:38.815
Most of the debris
we've examined

17:38.891 --> 17:41.052
is composed
of a polyduranide alloy,

17:41.126 --> 17:42.787
which isn't used
in the construction

17:42.861 --> 17:44.522
of Federation spacecraft.

17:44.596 --> 17:47.030
So it wasn't Chakotay's shuttle
that was destroyed.

17:47.099 --> 17:48.964
This ship was Kazon.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.772
You get them involved young,
Haliz.

17:58.844 --> 17:59.970
As soon as they're old enough

18:00.012 --> 18:02.242
to protect
their younger siblings.

18:07.119 --> 18:10.714
So they brought you here
to see your first human.

18:10.789 --> 18:13.417
Take a good look--

18:13.492 --> 18:16.586
you won't see
any hate in my eyes.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.186
l'm a gentle man

18:18.263 --> 18:20.424
from a gentle people
who wish you no harm.

18:20.499 --> 18:21.466
That's enough!

18:22.468 --> 18:24.459
l know you'd like them
to hate me, Razik,

18:24.536 --> 18:26.003
but l want their first
impression of humans

18:26.071 --> 18:27.095
to be a good one.

18:27.172 --> 18:28.196
You've been brought here

18:28.273 --> 18:31.242
to learn what it means
to be a Kazon male.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.575
You all know Kar.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.477
You've learned to fight
together, haven't you?

18:36.548 --> 18:41.247
Kar was sent to kill this man
to earn his Ogla name,

18:41.320 --> 18:43.686
but Kar failed

18:43.755 --> 18:46.315
and will not earn his name
even in death.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.017
Who would be willing
to kill the human?

18:52.231 --> 18:55.462
So much for first impressions,
Federation.

18:56.768 --> 18:58.861
l'm proud of you.

18:58.937 --> 19:00.996
Each will get
your chance someday.

19:01.106 --> 19:04.200
But that's not
what we're here for today.

19:05.310 --> 19:09.076
We are here to learn
the price of failure in battle.

19:12.050 --> 19:13.244
Take it.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.047
What for?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.417
So that you can kill Kar

19:16.488 --> 19:18.319
as you should have done
in battle.

19:18.390 --> 19:22.156
You want me to kill a child
in front of other children.

19:22.227 --> 19:24.127
What would it accomplish?

19:24.196 --> 19:27.757
lt will teach these little boys
an important lesson.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.530
And after you do that,
you'll be free to go.

19:31.603 --> 19:34.071
You may think l want
your friend Kar to die,

19:34.139 --> 19:36.334
but you'd be wrong.

19:36.408 --> 19:40.208
l've seen too many Ogla die
at the hands of our enemies.

19:40.279 --> 19:42.679
That is why you must learn
there are

19:42.748 --> 19:44.716
no second chances in battle.

19:44.783 --> 19:47.684
That is why Kar must die.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.252
lf l refuse?

20:19.151 --> 20:21.517
l'll be needing my shuttle back.

20:21.587 --> 20:22.986
Do you really think
you can escape us

20:23.088 --> 20:24.749
in that little vessel of yours?

20:24.823 --> 20:26.984
That's a chance
l'm willing to take.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.617
What about you?

20:28.694 --> 20:30.457
Let the coward run.

20:30.529 --> 20:31.996
Prepare his shuttle.

20:38.637 --> 20:39.695
Want to come?

20:40.906 --> 20:42.965
There doesn't seem to be
much of a future for you here.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.569
He'd rather die

20:45.644 --> 20:48.511
than run like a Calogan dog
with you, Federation.

20:55.554 --> 20:58.216
lf l stay here,
l'll die without a name,

20:58.290 --> 21:01.259
and Razik taught me
only cowards die without a name.

21:01.326 --> 21:02.384
You won't find your name

21:02.461 --> 21:04.088
running after the Federation,
Kar.

21:04.162 --> 21:05.629
Maybe not.

21:05.697 --> 21:07.631
But that's a chance
l'm willing to take.

21:12.504 --> 21:14.665
l'll show you how to disable
the weapon systems.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.279
Will Razik be all right?

21:25.350 --> 21:26.647
Don't worry.
He's only stunned.

21:28.954 --> 21:29.978
Didn't take them long

21:30.055 --> 21:32.216
to get those weapons
back on line, did it?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.758
Computer, prepare to go to warp.

21:33.825 --> 21:36.521
No. Their ship is much clumsier
at lower speeds.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.324
We should try
to outmaneuver them.

21:38.397 --> 21:39.694
You're the boss.

21:41.566 --> 21:45.024
lnitiate evasive pattern
theta two, full impulse.

21:45.103 --> 21:48.004
l can give you the shield
frequencies of their ship.

21:48.073 --> 21:49.472
We could hit them back easily.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.475
lt may mean something to you
to die a violent death,

21:51.543 --> 21:54.376
but l'd like to get out of this
without killing or being killed.

21:54.446 --> 21:56.971
You'd rather die in your sleep,
a wrinkled old man?

21:57.049 --> 21:58.277
Sounds about right.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.310
Computer, damage report.

22:02.387 --> 22:04.912
Aft shields at 63 percent.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.424
We're not going
to make it like this.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.926
Computer, scan
for an M-Class atmosphere.

22:09.995 --> 22:14.329
There is an M-Class moon
at bearing 108, mark 18.

22:14.399 --> 22:17.061
Distance 1.9 million kilometers.

22:17.135 --> 22:18.568
That's Tarok,

22:18.637 --> 22:21.538
where the Ogla conduct
training exercises.

22:21.606 --> 22:22.595
Anybody training there now?

22:25.043 --> 22:27.705
Computer, lay in a course
to the moon.

22:27.779 --> 22:29.804
Evasive pattern omega one.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.041
Maximum impulse.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.387
Warning. Aft shields
have been penetrated.

22:42.461 --> 22:43.655
Hull breach is imminent.

22:43.729 --> 22:45.822
Computer, prepare
for long-range transport.

22:45.897 --> 22:46.864
Two to beam to the surface.

22:46.932 --> 22:48.866
Transport is not recommended.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.834
The moon is out of safety range.

23:05.851 --> 23:08.251
Captain, the ion trail
is beginning to dissipate.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.480
All stop.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.215
l'm picking up debris again.

23:11.289 --> 23:14.622
More duranium, magnesite,
carbon residue...

23:15.794 --> 23:17.887
lt's the remnants
of another ship.

23:18.997 --> 23:20.259
Bridge to Engineering.

23:20.332 --> 23:22.562
Lieutenant Torres, prepare to
receive another debris sample.

23:22.634 --> 23:23.566
Acknowledged.

23:23.635 --> 23:25.899
Transport underway.

23:29.474 --> 23:32.204
Torres to Bridge.
Sample received.

23:32.277 --> 23:34.905
Let me know when you've
got something, B'Elanna.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.380
l've got something right now.

23:37.449 --> 23:40.418
lt's a piece
of Chakotay's shuttle.

23:54.666 --> 23:56.827
Kar...

23:56.902 --> 23:58.096
lt worked?

24:00.972 --> 24:01.961
The computer said

24:02.040 --> 24:04.008
that transport
wasn't recommended.

24:04.075 --> 24:06.373
Didn't say it was impossible.

24:08.513 --> 24:09.912
With any luck,

24:10.015 --> 24:13.109
Razik will think we didn't
survive the explosion.

24:13.185 --> 24:17.144
Then maybe you'll get your name
for dying in battle.

24:17.222 --> 24:19.452
ln battle?!

24:19.524 --> 24:22.118
That wasn't a battle!

24:22.194 --> 24:23.923
We didn't even shoot back.

24:24.029 --> 24:26.497
And now, l'm stranded here.

24:26.565 --> 24:28.362
With you.

24:30.268 --> 24:32.600
Yes, you're stranded here
with me.

24:34.673 --> 24:36.664
And l'm stranded here with you,

24:36.741 --> 24:38.641
because for some reason
that escapes me at the moment,

24:38.710 --> 24:40.075
l keep saving your life.

24:40.145 --> 24:43.239
Now if you want
to hate me for that, fine,

24:43.315 --> 24:45.875
but l'd really appreciate it
if you kept it to yourself.

24:45.951 --> 24:47.282
-You...
-To yourself!

24:51.423 --> 24:54.392
First thing we've got to do
is find some shelter

24:54.459 --> 24:55.983
and get out of this heat.

24:56.061 --> 24:58.029
Any suggestions?

25:05.303 --> 25:08.136
l think we're finally beginning
to understand each other.

25:12.944 --> 25:14.502
You don't know
what you're doing.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.973
What did l just say?

25:20.619 --> 25:22.780
Get down.

25:25.757 --> 25:27.691
What the hell was that?

25:27.759 --> 25:29.351
A proton beam.

25:32.898 --> 25:34.229
They're hidden everywhere,

25:34.299 --> 25:36.699
along with biomagnetic traps
and disrupter snares.

25:36.768 --> 25:37.735
Charming.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.030
l told you.

25:39.104 --> 25:41.129
The Ogla train on this moon.

25:41.206 --> 25:44.767
l was here myself last year
with Razik.

25:44.843 --> 25:46.037
So l guess you know
your way around.

25:46.111 --> 25:48.705
l know that you're
in my territory,

25:48.780 --> 25:51.271
and if you want to live
to become that wrinkled old man,

25:51.349 --> 25:53.840
you're going to have to do
what l say.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.287
Well, it looks like you
just saved my life.

25:57.355 --> 25:59.687
Twice more and we'll be even.

26:01.793 --> 26:04.591
l finished analyzing
the shuttle debris

26:04.663 --> 26:07.097
and l found no evidence
of human remains.

26:07.165 --> 26:09.963
Then it's possible Chakotay
wasn't killed in the explosion.

26:10.035 --> 26:11.332
That is correct.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.031
That's the first good news
l've heard all day.

26:14.105 --> 26:15.072
Thank you, Doctor.

26:15.140 --> 26:16.232
My pleasure.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.868
Now, would you mind having
someone transport this junk

26:18.977 --> 26:20.444
to the cargo bay?

26:22.380 --> 26:23.711
lt's cluttering up my lab.

26:23.782 --> 26:25.511
Of course, Doctor.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.052
All right then,
if Commander Chakotay

26:28.119 --> 26:30.053
wasn't in the shuttle,
where is he?

26:30.121 --> 26:32.214
From the dispersal
pattern of the debris,

26:32.290 --> 26:33.917
we've been able to extrapolate
Chakotay's course

26:34.025 --> 26:35.652
prior to the explosion.

26:35.727 --> 26:36.659
lt appears he was heading

26:36.728 --> 26:38.855
for an M-Class moon
in this system.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.454
And we found a residual
energy displacement

26:40.532 --> 26:41.760
within the debris field

26:41.833 --> 26:44.233
that isn't consistent
with the explosion itself.

26:44.302 --> 26:46.361
You think he may have
transported to that moon.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.905
We tried to scan the surface,

26:47.973 --> 26:50.066
but there is intense
radiothermic interference.

26:50.141 --> 26:51.369
Radiothermic?

26:51.443 --> 26:52.410
lt appears to be coming

26:52.477 --> 26:54.536
from subterranean
energy sources--

26:54.613 --> 26:57.639
several carefully concealed
weapon systems-- phaser banks,

26:57.716 --> 26:59.946
force fields,
proton dischargers.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.280
Kazon.

27:01.319 --> 27:02.286
When they captured me,

27:02.320 --> 27:04.151
l saw how they concealed
their weaponry.

27:04.222 --> 27:07.783
l believe you call them
''booby traps.''

27:07.859 --> 27:11.124
Then this moon is some kind
of Kazon fortification.

27:11.196 --> 27:13.391
Or it may simply be
a training site.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.797
For the Kazon, live ammunition

27:15.867 --> 27:18.427
is a very effective
teaching tool.

27:18.503 --> 27:21.495
ln the absence of evidence
to the contrary

27:21.573 --> 27:24.303
l choose to believe
Chakotay made it to that moon.

27:24.376 --> 27:25.866
Mr. Kim, see
if you can determine

27:26.011 --> 27:28.479
the most probable location
he would've beamed to.

27:28.546 --> 27:30.741
Lieutenant, you and l
will lead the away team.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.079
As you wish, Captain,
but l must point out

27:33.151 --> 27:35.085
that due to radiothermic
interference,

27:35.153 --> 27:36.780
we will not be able
to communicate with the ship.

27:36.855 --> 27:38.288
l'm already working
on a dampening field

27:38.356 --> 27:39.482
to cut through the interference,

27:39.557 --> 27:42.253
but it'll take several
hours at least.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.919
l don't want to wait that long,
but keep trying.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.190
Neelix, Kes, you are
our two Kazon experts.

27:46.264 --> 27:47.697
Kes, you'll come
with Tuvok and me.

27:47.766 --> 27:50.030
Neelix, you said
you wanted more to do.

27:50.101 --> 27:51.568
Well, now's your chance.

27:51.636 --> 27:53.331
l want you on the Bridge
with Mr. Paris,

27:53.405 --> 27:55.930
in case we run
into any Kazon ships.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.406
Don't worry, Captain.

27:57.475 --> 27:58.908
You can count on me

27:58.977 --> 28:00.808
to keep those nefarious Kazon
at bay.

28:02.847 --> 28:03.939
Dismissed.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.848
What are you doing?

28:40.919 --> 28:43.513
l'm setting my tricorder
to emit a homing signal.

28:43.588 --> 28:44.919
What for?

28:45.023 --> 28:45.921
So when my people show up,

28:46.024 --> 28:47.286
they'll know
where to look for me.

28:47.358 --> 28:48.825
They won't come.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.019
They'll think you're dead.

28:50.095 --> 28:51.687
They're very persistent.

28:51.763 --> 28:53.492
l'm betting
they haven't given up on me.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.226
Well, maybe l should kill you

28:55.300 --> 28:56.790
and steal your technology

28:56.868 --> 28:58.802
and deliver it to my people.

28:58.870 --> 29:01.464
Then they'd have
to give me my name.

29:02.373 --> 29:03.965
You just won't give up,
will you?

29:07.245 --> 29:09.713
You won't stop me from earning
my name, Federation.

29:09.781 --> 29:12.716
Not Federation-- Chakotay.

29:12.784 --> 29:14.843
That's my name.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.978
Did you have to earn it?

29:19.624 --> 29:21.854
No, not exactly.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.053
Then your name means nothing.

29:25.964 --> 29:28.432
My name was a gift...

29:28.500 --> 29:30.092
from my tribe.

29:30.168 --> 29:33.501
l cherish it
every day of my life.

29:35.440 --> 29:39.035
Just as l cherish
the Federation uniform.

29:39.110 --> 29:42.341
l should respect you
because you wear that uniform.

29:42.413 --> 29:45.314
Your name, my uniform--

29:45.383 --> 29:47.283
not much difference.

29:47.352 --> 29:48.580
We both have to earn them.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.850
What did you have to do
to earn your uniform?

29:54.926 --> 29:56.450
Study.

29:56.528 --> 30:00.259
Years of study.

30:00.331 --> 30:05.496
Learning about science
and ships and navigation.

30:05.570 --> 30:08.368
l suppose they don't expect you
to prove your battle skills.

30:08.439 --> 30:12.933
No. They prepared us
to defend ourselves in battle.

30:13.077 --> 30:15.545
They prepared us very well,

30:15.613 --> 30:17.945
and we had to pass
many difficult tests

30:18.016 --> 30:20.610
before we were given the right
to wear the uniform.

30:20.685 --> 30:22.482
You're saying that my name
and your uniform

30:22.554 --> 30:24.784
mean the same thing.

30:24.856 --> 30:25.914
But you're wrong.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.287
Why?

30:27.358 --> 30:29.519
What's so different about us?

30:29.594 --> 30:31.755
Aside from the fact that
l keep saving your life,

30:31.830 --> 30:33.593
and you keep
threatening to kill me?

30:33.665 --> 30:36.259
l must protect my territory.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.494
Territory is power.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.264
Let me tell you something.

30:39.337 --> 30:40.998
l have no interest
in your territory

30:41.105 --> 30:42.936
or anybody else's.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.840
My people taught me

30:46.911 --> 30:49.778
a man does not own land.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.646
He doesn't own anything

30:52.717 --> 30:55.345
but the courage and
loyalty in his heart.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.878
That's where my power
comes from.

31:00.558 --> 31:03.152
l think we both could use
some sleep, don't you?

33:12.090 --> 33:13.819
l've got a Kazon raider
approaching

33:13.891 --> 33:15.552
at bearing 288 mark 9.

33:15.626 --> 33:16.923
On screen.

33:18.296 --> 33:19.627
Open a channel.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.234
l'm Lieutenant Tom Paris
of the Starship Voyager.

33:25.303 --> 33:28.739
Jal Razik, first maje
of the Kazon-Ogla.

33:28.806 --> 33:30.603
l will speak to your Captain.

33:31.776 --> 33:34.506
l'm in command right now,
so you can speak to me.

33:37.382 --> 33:39.282
You are trespassing
in Ogla space.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.750
Why do you orbit our moon?

33:41.819 --> 33:44.287
Just stopped to make
a few repairs.

33:44.355 --> 33:45.913
We'll be on our way in no time.

33:45.990 --> 33:47.480
That is a lie.

33:47.558 --> 33:49.651
You are here looking
for your Commander Chakotay.

33:51.262 --> 33:53.753
Now, how would
you know about that?

33:53.831 --> 33:54.820
Quite simply.

33:54.899 --> 33:56.025
We killed him.

33:59.570 --> 34:01.231
Under what circumstances?

34:01.339 --> 34:02.897
He kidnapped a young man.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.066
During his escape,

34:04.142 --> 34:06.474
it became necessary
to destroy his ship.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.478
No doubt
you've found the remains.

34:08.545 --> 34:10.878
So l suggest you depart
immediately.

34:10.947 --> 34:13.041
Thanks for the advice.

34:13.117 --> 34:15.347
What a most unusual offer.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.888
A Kazon-Ogla maje

34:17.955 --> 34:21.755
allowing a trespasser
to leave his space unharmed.

34:21.826 --> 34:24.420
What would the other Kazon say

34:24.495 --> 34:27.589
about this new merciful attitude
of the Ogla?

34:27.665 --> 34:29.098
Don't tempt me, Talaxian.

34:29.167 --> 34:30.600
l would just as soon open fire.

34:30.668 --> 34:31.600
Would you?

34:31.668 --> 34:32.636
Neelix...

34:33.638 --> 34:36.505
No, l don't think so.

34:36.574 --> 34:40.601
That would attract
every rival Kazon sect

34:40.678 --> 34:43.168
to your secret training base,
wouldn't it?

34:43.246 --> 34:46.978
Now, l know your ships, Maje.

34:47.051 --> 34:50.987
l even sold a few Plaxan sensors
to the Ogla a few years back.

34:51.054 --> 34:53.181
l have no doubt

34:53.257 --> 34:54.884
that you read
the same life signs

34:54.958 --> 34:56.290
on that moon that we have.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.625
Perhaps one of those life signs
belongs to your Captain.

34:59.697 --> 35:01.528
lf you've detected
the extensive weaponry

35:01.632 --> 35:03.327
deployed on the moon, know this.

35:03.367 --> 35:06.359
With one remote command,
l can cause that weaponry

35:06.437 --> 35:09.167
to self-destruct, destroying
the surface of the moon

35:09.240 --> 35:10.867
and everyone on it.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.638
Neither of us wants that, do we?

35:13.811 --> 35:16.279
Think of the cost of replacing
all those weapons.

35:16.347 --> 35:18.713
Awfully hard to come by
in this region.

35:18.783 --> 35:22.719
And it would make you
so vulnerable to your enemies.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.778
We'll leave as soon
as we've retrieved

35:24.856 --> 35:26.084
our crewmen-- all of them,

35:26.157 --> 35:28.819
including Chakotay,
if he's alive.

35:28.893 --> 35:30.918
And if one of your people
is with him,

35:30.995 --> 35:32.462
he'll be returned to you.

35:34.765 --> 35:37.256
They're moving
into a lower orbit.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.098
Looks like they're intending
to enter the atmosphere.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.638
l need communication
with the surface, B'Elanna,

35:41.706 --> 35:42.866
and soon.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.500
l still haven't been able to get
the dampening field working.

35:45.576 --> 35:48.545
l can't even give you
an estimate.

35:48.613 --> 35:50.046
Should we take Voyager down?

35:50.114 --> 35:51.979
l've already run
a soil analysis.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.846
The surface won't support
a landing.

35:53.918 --> 35:56.546
Then l guess the Captain's
going to be greeted

35:56.621 --> 35:58.418
by some unexpected visitors.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.514
At least
we bought her some time.

36:15.606 --> 36:17.164
Good morning.

36:17.241 --> 36:18.868
How did you sleep?

36:19.010 --> 36:20.307
Fine.

36:20.378 --> 36:21.845
Really?

36:21.913 --> 36:24.313
You seemed
a little restless to me.

36:24.382 --> 36:26.043
What do you mean?

36:26.117 --> 36:29.746
All that skulking around,
throwing things.

36:29.820 --> 36:31.151
You were awake?

36:31.222 --> 36:32.849
You think l'm going
to get much sleep

36:32.924 --> 36:35.324
around an Ogla warrior
who's threatened to kill me?

36:36.427 --> 36:38.759
Why didn't you
go through with it?

36:40.431 --> 36:41.420
l am a coward.

36:41.499 --> 36:43.023
l don't believe that.

36:43.100 --> 36:45.159
l don't believe you do, either.

36:45.236 --> 36:48.728
l think maybe you're beginning
to realize l'm not your enemy,

36:48.806 --> 36:51.502
and only a fool
would kill a friend.

36:51.576 --> 36:53.510
lf you are my friend...

36:53.578 --> 36:55.773
then you're my only one.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.779
What happens to me now?

37:00.885 --> 37:02.147
Where do l go?

37:02.186 --> 37:04.746
Would any other Kazon sect
accept you?

37:04.822 --> 37:07.484
l would be a goven, an outcast.

37:07.558 --> 37:10.527
Each Kazon sect l meet
would cut one digit off,

37:10.595 --> 37:12.756
send me away.

37:12.830 --> 37:15.458
How many Kazon sects are there?

37:15.533 --> 37:16.864
lt changes every day.

37:16.934 --> 37:18.799
Yesterday, there were 18.

37:18.869 --> 37:21.463
l guess you could come with us.

37:21.539 --> 37:23.769
To do what?
Dress in a uniform?

37:23.841 --> 37:25.433
You wouldn't have
to wear a uniform.

37:25.509 --> 37:27.340
And the closer you get
to your home,

37:27.411 --> 37:29.038
the farther l would be
from mine.

37:32.516 --> 37:34.484
lf only you had killed me.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.457
Captain, four life-forms
approaching.

37:44.528 --> 37:45.893
40 meters.

37:45.963 --> 37:47.362
They appear to be Kazon.

37:52.236 --> 37:54.295
Please, put your weapons away.
We've come to help you.

37:54.372 --> 37:55.304
Help us?

37:55.373 --> 37:56.465
With what?

37:56.540 --> 37:58.531
We made contact with your ship

37:58.609 --> 38:00.577
and learned of the plight
of your missing crewman.

38:00.678 --> 38:03.579
We've come to offer
our assistance in finding him.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.673
That's very kind of you.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.843
You're walking
on very dangerous ground.

38:07.918 --> 38:10.216
There are concealed weapons
everywhere.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.722
Come.
We will lead you through them.

38:15.359 --> 38:16.690
Very well.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.868
Tell me
about the other uniforms--

38:28.973 --> 38:30.736
the ones the Kazon fought.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.799
The Trabe.

38:32.877 --> 38:34.674
The Kazon
shared their homeworld--

38:34.745 --> 38:37.043
if you can call it sharing.

38:37.114 --> 38:39.412
They had everything;
we had nothing.

38:39.483 --> 38:43.010
Until we took it from them
in the revolt 26 years ago.

38:44.388 --> 38:45.878
What is it?

38:45.956 --> 38:48.618
People coming this way.

38:48.693 --> 38:49.682
Humans and Kazon.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.024
What are we going to do?

38:52.096 --> 38:55.190
There's only one way back
to the Ogla for you

38:55.266 --> 38:56.824
and that's if you
earn your name.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.094
So l guess that's
what you'll have to do.

39:00.204 --> 39:02.331
But how?

39:03.441 --> 39:05.375
You're going to have to kill me.

39:12.683 --> 39:14.651
The signal seems to be coming
from some caves

39:14.719 --> 39:16.448
approximately 40 meters ahead.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.681
Your technology
continues to amaze us.

39:18.756 --> 39:20.849
lt would have taken us
weeks to track them.

39:20.925 --> 39:23.723
After this is over, we have
to discuss an alliance.

39:23.794 --> 39:25.955
l would welcome
your friendship, Maje.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.861
Captain Janeway, l'm reading

39:27.932 --> 39:30.400
elevated... radiothermic
levels here.

39:30.468 --> 39:31.992
The Ocampa female is correct.

39:32.069 --> 39:34.060
This is a particularly
dangerous place.

39:34.138 --> 39:35.867
We lose many trainees here.

39:35.973 --> 39:38.305
Perhaps you would prefer
if we proceeded alone.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.741
They can't be far now.

39:39.810 --> 39:42.643
Thanks, but l think
we'll stick together.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.180
Voyager to away team.

39:44.248 --> 39:45.738
We're here, Mr. Paris.

39:45.816 --> 39:47.750
We finally broke through
the interference, Captain.

39:47.818 --> 39:48.785
Are you all right?

39:48.853 --> 39:49.785
We had a run-in...

39:49.854 --> 39:50.786
Everything is fine.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.618
We have the assistance
of the Ogla.

39:52.690 --> 39:56.217
That's what l was going
to tell you to expect.

39:56.293 --> 39:57.920
Can you lock on
to Commander Chakotay?

39:57.995 --> 39:59.019
Stand by.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.930
Voyager to Chakotay.
Do you read?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.592
l'm fine, Paris.

40:04.668 --> 40:06.932
Stand by for us
to beam you out of there.

40:07.004 --> 40:09.131
Belay that, Voyager.
Stand by.

40:09.206 --> 40:10.673
According to my readings,

40:10.741 --> 40:12.504
the away team's
only 50 meters away.

40:12.576 --> 40:13.770
Right, but don't...

40:13.844 --> 40:16.711
And alert Sick Bay to prepare
for a Code White resuscitation.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.306
Did you say ''Code White''?

40:19.383 --> 40:20.441
Correct.

40:20.518 --> 40:21.917
l don't have time
to explain now.

40:21.986 --> 40:23.476
Chakotay out.

40:25.356 --> 40:26.414
lt'll be all right.

40:26.490 --> 40:27.980
Our technology can revive me

40:28.058 --> 40:29.787
even if l'm brain-dead
for two minutes.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.350
Why are you doing this?

40:31.429 --> 40:32.453
Like you said,

40:32.530 --> 40:34.225
it's my fault
you don't have your name.

40:34.298 --> 40:36.357
l can't leave you
behind like this.

40:39.537 --> 40:41.801
Chakotay to away team.

40:41.872 --> 40:43.533
Good to hear your voice,
Commander.

40:43.607 --> 40:45.268
Captain, proceed with caution.

40:45.342 --> 40:48.311
l have been taken prisoner
by a young Kazon.

40:48.379 --> 40:49.676
He's threatening to kill me.

40:53.617 --> 40:54.641
This way.

40:54.718 --> 40:55.776
lt's safer.

40:55.853 --> 40:57.150
l would beg to differ.

40:57.221 --> 40:59.519
Based on these readings,
that way

40:59.590 --> 41:01.683
would seem the logical choice.

41:01.792 --> 41:03.225
l must apologize for my comrade.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.660
l believe he's trying
to mislead you.

41:13.003 --> 41:16.063
So your technology
is not always an ally.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.631
Sometimes it betrays you-- pity.

41:18.709 --> 41:20.540
l'm afraid
you would not score well

41:20.611 --> 41:23.011
in our training exercises.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.649
Away team to Voyager.

41:31.722 --> 41:34.589
Captain, that panel
is a micro-generator.

41:34.658 --> 41:35.590
You're right.

41:35.659 --> 41:36.921
lf we can get a narrow beam

41:36.994 --> 41:38.894
through the field,
we can disable it.

41:38.963 --> 41:40.521
We could try remodulating
the phasers

41:40.598 --> 41:41.758
to a higher-frequency output.

41:41.832 --> 41:42.799
Make it fast.

41:50.708 --> 41:52.676
l've been waiting for you,
Razik.

41:54.879 --> 41:58.042
So, the Federation Commander
is your prisoner.

41:58.115 --> 41:59.446
l only came with him

41:59.517 --> 42:01.747
so l could have another
chance to kill him.

42:01.852 --> 42:04.116
So you could earn your name.

42:04.154 --> 42:06.247
That's what l've been
hoping for, Razik.

42:06.323 --> 42:08.587
But you taught me well.

42:08.659 --> 42:10.456
l know what you're going to say.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.553
You've said it
so many times before.

42:12.630 --> 42:15.963
ln battle, there are
no second chances.

42:21.772 --> 42:23.763
But you are not my enemy.

42:23.841 --> 42:25.308
He is.

42:30.314 --> 42:33.078
My name is Jal Karden,
Kazon-Ogla.

42:38.088 --> 42:41.114
You are first maje now, Haliz.

42:41.191 --> 42:43.250
My life is yours.

42:50.034 --> 42:51.524
Kill me if you wish,

42:51.602 --> 42:54.594
or let me live and l will
follow you into battle

42:54.672 --> 42:56.401
whenever you command.

43:04.715 --> 43:06.546
Jal Karden.

43:09.553 --> 43:11.817
Kazon-Ogla.

43:11.889 --> 43:12.947
Kazon-Ogla.

43:17.361 --> 43:19.522
The Federation
does not belong here.

43:19.597 --> 43:23.055
lf we meet again,
l will not hesitate to kill you.

43:24.335 --> 43:25.427
l understand.

43:33.344 --> 43:34.538
Janeway to Voyager.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.580
Five to beam up.

44:05.442 --> 44:07.637
A-koo-chee-moya.

44:07.711 --> 44:12.011
l pray on this day of memories

44:12.082 --> 44:14.573
to speak to my father--

44:14.652 --> 44:17.587
the one whom the wind
called Kolopak.

44:17.655 --> 44:21.284
Father, if you can hear me
among these unnamed stars,

44:21.358 --> 44:24.156
l ask you to continue
to watch over me

44:24.228 --> 44:25.889
as you've always done.

44:25.963 --> 44:31.094
l ask you also to watch over
a boy called Karden,

44:31.168 --> 44:34.103
who has a difficult path
to travel.

44:34.171 --> 44:36.867
A-koo-chee-moya.

44:37.305 --> 44:43.587
