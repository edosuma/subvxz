WEBVTT

02:00.036 --> 02:01.830
Keep breathing.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.878
And push.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.304
And again.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.182
I can't.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.060
Push!

02:27.564 --> 02:28.648
The head!

02:42.161 --> 02:43.663
A boy, Princess.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.540
Praise the Mother!

02:59.345 --> 03:00.430
Healthy?

03:00.513 --> 03:02.599
Kicking like a goat, Princess.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.531
Princess...

03:19.866 --> 03:23.369
the Queen has requested that
the child be brought to her...

03:23.453 --> 03:24.954
immediately.

03:27.790 --> 03:28.708
Why?

03:39.260 --> 03:40.386
I'll take him myself.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.971
You should remain abed, Princess--

03:42.055 --> 03:43.973
Yes, I should! Help me dress.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.700
Princess...

04:04.327 --> 04:05.578
your dress?

04:38.987 --> 04:40.780
Princess?

04:40.863 --> 04:42.824
-It's coming.
-The afterbirth!

04:53.501 --> 04:55.712
A boy. I've just heard.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.338
-Yes.
-Well done.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.759
-Where are you going?
-She wants to see him.

05:01.843 --> 05:02.760
Now?

05:04.178 --> 05:05.346
I'm coming with you.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.348
-I should hope so.
-Let me take him.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.308
No, she'll get no such
satisfaction from me.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.519
Just take my arm, at the least.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.192
Was it terribly painful?

05:19.777 --> 05:20.862
Oh gods.

05:25.908 --> 05:28.036
I took a lance through the shoulder once.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.039
My deepest sympathies.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.957
The Princess... The Princess...

05:33.041 --> 05:35.001
I am glad I am not a woman.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.628
-My Princess...
-My Lord...

05:43.092 --> 05:45.261
What is it?

05:45.344 --> 05:46.888
What is it? What is it?

05:47.597 --> 05:48.514
Fuck.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.642
Walk. Walk!

05:56.898 --> 05:58.816
What could she possibly want?

06:00.777 --> 06:02.320
I thought we were past this.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.869
Princess, Ser Laenor, it is a privilege

06:09.952 --> 06:11.829
to be amongst the first
to congratulate you.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.915
Thank you, Lord Caswell.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.959
If I may be of any service.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.170
The day may yet come, my Lord.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.846
We are turning back, all right?

06:28.930 --> 06:31.349
She can come to us, all right?

06:31.432 --> 06:34.352
No. Not unless you wish to carry me down
those fucking stairs.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.579
This is absurd.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.722
Princess.

07:29.574 --> 07:33.494
Rhaenyra!
You should be resting after your labors.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.832
I have no doubt that
you would prefer that, Your Grace.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.375
You must sit.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.752
Talya, fetch a cushion for the Princess.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.963
-There's no need.
-Nonsense.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.716
We'll finish this later.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.427
Your Grace.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.810
What happy news this morning.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.271
Indeed, Your Grace.

08:00.354 --> 08:01.689
Where is he?

08:02.607 --> 08:05.526
Where is my grandson? There.

08:07.361 --> 08:08.905
There he is.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.202
A fine Prince.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.037
Sturdy.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.123
You will make a fearsome knight.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.250
Yes, you will.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.543
Does the babe have a name yet?

08:23.669 --> 08:25.213
-We haven't spoken--
-Joffrey.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.090
He'll be called Joffrey.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.676
That's an unusual name for a Velaryon.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.931
I do believe he has his father's nose.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.726
Don't you?

08:43.940 --> 08:45.358
If you don't mind, Your Grace,

08:45.441 --> 08:48.736
your daughter has exerted herself
heroically and should rest.

08:48.819 --> 08:49.946
Of course.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.032
There.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.793
Well done, my girl.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.130
I do hope the labor was easy.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.176
I think I called the midwife a cunt.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.061
Do keep trying, Ser Laenor.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.648
Soon or late, you may get one
who looks like you.

09:39.996 --> 09:44.125
You don't think to consult me
before you name my child?

09:44.208 --> 09:46.127
He's our child, is he not?

09:47.920 --> 09:49.922
Only one of us is bleeding.

09:50.006 --> 09:53.050
I deserve some say in the affairs
of my own family.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.512
You haven't seemed so interested
in our affairs of late.

10:09.150 --> 10:12.486
And he sees a big, scary dragon!

10:17.575 --> 10:19.285
Mother...

10:19.368 --> 10:20.494
look.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.668
We chose an egg for the baby.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.630
That looks like the perfect one.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.633
-I let Luke choose.
-Thank you, Jace.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.011
Not every day an egg leaves the Dragonpit,
Princess.

10:37.094 --> 10:40.014
I thought it best to escort the lads.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.934
Laenor and I thank you, Commander.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.104
Another boy, I heard.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.653
What a fine knight you
are going to make, eh?

10:54.737 --> 10:56.197
Might I?

10:58.074 --> 11:00.826
Ser Harwin wishes to be
introduced to Joffrey.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.163
Of course.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.375
Joffrey, is it?

11:15.633 --> 11:17.927
Father, please may I hold Joffrey?

11:18.010 --> 11:20.179
No, no. No.

11:20.262 --> 11:22.473
Back to the Dragonpit for you two.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.476
-Come on!
-Before they send out a search party.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.865
You're asleep in front of
the Commander of the City Watch.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.494
Terrible lack of respect.

11:43.577 --> 11:47.123
A certain insolence
runs in the family, I'm afraid.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.426
Call Vermax to heel, Prince Jacaerys.

13:16.837 --> 13:17.630
Vermax!

13:18.714 --> 13:19.840
Vermax!

13:23.469 --> 13:27.223
Zaldrizo aoho syt aeksio sagon ao bevilza,

13:27.306 --> 13:28.849
darilaros nuhys--

13:28.933 --> 13:30.726
You must hold mastery over your dragon,
my young Princes.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.938
...hae Darilarot Aegot Vvsperzomy.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.689
As Prince Aegon has with Sunfyre.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.943
Zijosy aot tetiri ozlettosy,

13:39.026 --> 13:43.155
toli rybagon zirylo vindilza.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.782
Once they're fully bound to you,
they will refuse

13:44.865 --> 13:46.825
to take instruction from any other.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.915
Can I say it?

13:59.964 --> 14:01.340
Dracarys, Vermax!

14:24.363 --> 14:26.907
Aemond, we have a surprise for you.

14:27.866 --> 14:29.868
-What is it?
-Something very special.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.914
You're the only one
of us without a dragon.

14:33.998 --> 14:34.999
Indeed.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.585
And we felt badly about it,

14:37.668 --> 14:40.588
so we found one for you.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.549
A dragon? How?

14:43.632 --> 14:45.509
The gods provide.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.312
-Behold--
-The Pink Dread!

14:59.398 --> 15:00.733
Be sure to mount her carefully.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.568
First flight's always rough.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.291
This one has 60 rings...

16:42.167 --> 16:44.086
and two pairs of legs on each.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.380
That's 240.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.966
Yes, it is.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.970
It has eyes...

16:53.887 --> 16:54.805
though...

16:55.639 --> 16:57.558
I don't believe it can see.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.769
And why is that so, do you think?

17:02.896 --> 17:04.815
It is beyond our understanding.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.445
I suppose you're right.
Some things just are.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.242
Your Grace.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.369
Aemond.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.122
-What have you done?
-He did it again.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.540
After how many times
you've been warned,

17:21.623 --> 17:23.041
must I have you confined
to your chambers?!

17:23.125 --> 17:24.877
-They made me do it!
-As if you needed encouragement.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.171
Your obsession with those beasts
goes beyond understanding.

17:27.254 --> 17:28.422
They gave me a pig!

17:29.256 --> 17:30.257
A what?

17:30.340 --> 17:31.925
They said they found a dragon for me.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.219
The last ring has no legs at all.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.596
But it was a pig.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.265
You will have a dragon one day.

17:39.016 --> 17:42.227
-He'll have to close an eye.
-I know it.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.855
They all laughed.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.653
They made wings for it,
apparently, and a tail.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.405
The lad shouldn't have been so credulous.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.531
He's a child.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.743
He thought they'd happened upon
some wild unnamed dragon

17:57.826 --> 17:59.203
and lured it to the Dragonpit?

17:59.286 --> 18:00.829
Your grandsons are a menace.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.623
They're more children than he is.

18:02.706 --> 18:05.834
They're savages.
And it's not surprising.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.839
Are you sure it wasn't
our Aegon who put them up to it?

18:14.802 --> 18:16.720
It's a wonder to me
their eggs ever hatched.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.307
-And why is that?
-You know why.

18:20.390 --> 18:23.268
-I'm afraid I don't.
-Don't!

18:23.352 --> 18:24.895
Viserys.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.733
We shall continue this afternoon, Eddard.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.869
I have raised this matter before

18:40.953 --> 18:43.413
and you forbade me to speak of it,
so I held my tongue.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.918
To have one child like that is a mistake,

18:48.001 --> 18:50.587
to have three is an insult,

18:50.671 --> 18:53.090
to the throne, to you,
to House Velaryon

18:53.173 --> 18:55.634
and the match you battled
so hard to make for her.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.262
Not to mention decency itself.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.390
I had a black mare once.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.017
Black like a raven.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.854
One day, she escaped her pasture

19:06.937 --> 19:09.481
and the neighboring stallion
sired a foal on her.

19:11.817 --> 19:15.988
The stallion was as silver as the moon
on a winter's night

19:16.071 --> 19:18.740
and the foal, when it was born,

19:18.824 --> 19:20.742
chestnut.

19:21.577 --> 19:25.706
Just the most unremarkable
brown horse you ever saw.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.127
Nature is a thing of mysterious works.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.676
How do you know?

19:39.636 --> 19:41.179
The silver stallion.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.223
How do you know it was him?

19:45.309 --> 19:46.810
Did you witness the act itself?

19:51.189 --> 19:53.358
The consequences

19:53.442 --> 19:56.695
of an allegation like the one you toy at

19:56.778 --> 19:58.322
would be dire.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.582
Do not speak of this again.

20:19.134 --> 20:21.428
Have I lost my sanity, Ser Criston?

20:21.511 --> 20:22.554
Do my senses lead me astray?

20:22.638 --> 20:25.474
Or is everyone else asleep,
dreaming the same woolly dream?

20:25.557 --> 20:27.476
Sometimes seems so, Your Grace.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.397
She flaunts the privilege
of her inheritance without shame.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.399
She expects everyone in the Red Keep
to deny the truth

20:34.483 --> 20:35.817
our eyes can all plainly see.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.235
-And the King, her father--
-He knows.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.403
Of course, he knows.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.030
Or did once, but has convinced
himself otherwise.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.032
He'll do naught but make excuses for her.

20:42.908 --> 20:46.536
The Princess Rhaenyra
is brazen and relentless.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.957
A spider who stings
and sucks her prey dry.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.668
A spoiled cunt.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.467
That was beneath me, Your Grace.
I apologize.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.681
I have to believe,

21:05.764 --> 21:09.309
that in the end,
honor and decency will prevail.

21:10.477 --> 21:13.605
We need to hew to that and to each other.

21:32.582 --> 21:33.959
Whose idea was it?

21:39.256 --> 21:40.340
The pig.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.468
-Was it your plot?
-No...

21:44.177 --> 21:47.097
it was Jace and

21:48.473 --> 21:50.308
it was the two of them.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.019
I couldn't be sure.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.520
Aemond is your brother.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.731
-Well, he's a twat.
-We are family.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.150
You may cuff him about
as you wish at home,

21:58.233 --> 22:01.361
but in the world,
we must defend our own.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.529
It was funny.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.365
Do you think Rhaenyra's sons
will be your playthings forever?

22:07.200 --> 22:08.326
As things stand...

22:09.161 --> 22:12.873
Rhaenyra will ascend the throne
and Jacaerys Targaryen will be her heir.

22:13.498 --> 22:16.084
-So?
-You are nearly a man-grown.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.211
How is it that you can be so shortsighted?

22:21.006 --> 22:22.924
If Rhaenyra comes into power...

22:23.633 --> 22:26.178
your very life could be forfeit.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.680
Aemond's as well.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.601
She could move to cut off any challenge
to her succession.

22:33.393 --> 22:35.187
-Then I won't challenge--
- You are the challenge!

22:35.270 --> 22:36.772
You are the challenge, Aegon!

22:36.855 --> 22:39.399
Simply by living and breathing!

22:43.904 --> 22:46.865
You are the King's firstborn son

22:46.948 --> 22:49.743
and what they know,
what everyone in the realm knows

22:49.826 --> 22:51.745
in their blood and in their bones...

22:52.996 --> 22:55.916
is that one day, you will be our King.

23:04.966 --> 23:05.884
Get dressed.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.233
Dracarys!

24:31.136 --> 24:33.555
The lamb hearts are excellent.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.391
We are fortunate in our cook,
Your Excellence.

24:36.474 --> 24:37.767
There's a plum-cake yet to be served,

24:37.851 --> 24:39.811
which will have us
fighting over the crumbs.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.813
Then before we come to blows...

24:43.440 --> 24:47.319
a toast to Aegon the Conqueror,
your exalted forebear,

24:47.402 --> 24:51.281
who joined our cause against Volantis
in the Century of Blood.

24:51.364 --> 24:54.618
On the great dragon Balerion,
he flew to our aid in Lys

24:54.701 --> 24:58.205
and burned a fleet of enemy ships,
thus turning the tide.

25:00.498 --> 25:03.043
-Aegon the Conqueror.
-To Aegon.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.256
This brings me to some business.

25:08.965 --> 25:11.134
A proposal I wish to make

25:11.218 --> 25:14.054
in the spirit of honoring
our storied alliance.

25:14.137 --> 25:16.681
If your aim is to marry
one of our daughters, Your Excellence,

25:16.765 --> 25:19.184
you might have said so
and spared us the history lesson.

25:19.267 --> 25:21.102
What?

25:21.186 --> 25:24.272
I would not count myself
so deserving, my Lady Laena.

25:26.983 --> 25:31.363
I wish to offer you a permanent residence
here in Pentos.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.865
This manse I would gift to you, outright,

25:33.949 --> 25:36.243
along with its farms and lands,

25:36.326 --> 25:38.036
the vineyard and the wood.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.247
The tenants would pay
their tributes annually

25:40.330 --> 25:42.457
to their new Targaryen lord.

25:42.540 --> 25:45.043
You would have your freedom
of the city and the harbor,

25:45.126 --> 25:47.879
as befits your royal station.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.467
Continue.

25:52.550 --> 25:55.845
Lys and its allies rise again.

25:55.929 --> 26:00.475
The Triarchy has made common cause
with Qoren Martell of Dorne.

26:00.558 --> 26:03.603
At any moment,
they may turn their sights north.

26:03.687 --> 26:06.106
Your family has dragons.

26:06.189 --> 26:09.943
Three now, mayhaps four in the future.

26:11.027 --> 26:14.864
My aim is to protect Pentos
from the lustful eye of the Triarchy.

26:14.948 --> 26:18.576
Aid Pentos in this, as Aegon once did...

26:19.286 --> 26:23.456
and my gratitude will fill your cup
and overflow it.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.834
Your Excellence, we are travelers.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.461
We've already extended our visit here.

26:32.924 --> 26:34.676
It's a most generous offer.

26:35.385 --> 26:37.304
And one we will certainly entertain.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.420
You are considering
Prince Reggio's offer.

27:10.503 --> 27:12.505
We have a good life here.

27:12.589 --> 27:16.009
We're free to do as we please,
welcomed and feted.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.386
-And eternally guests.
-Precisely.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.431
We are without responsibility.
The political scheming,

27:21.514 --> 27:24.184
the endless shifting
of loyalties and succession

27:24.267 --> 27:25.685
is none of ours.

27:26.519 --> 27:29.439
-They are using us.
-It's refreshing, isn't it?

27:30.982 --> 27:32.567
A simple transaction.

27:32.650 --> 27:35.195
We have dragons, they have gold.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.369
We are more than this, Daemon.

27:42.452 --> 27:43.787
We are not minstrels or mummers

27:43.870 --> 27:45.455
who play at the pleasure
of an alien prince.

27:45.538 --> 27:47.874
We are the blood of Old Valyria.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.543
We don't belong here.

27:50.627 --> 27:53.171
Valyria is gone. We don't belong anywhere.

27:58.885 --> 28:03.556
I want my child to be born
where I was born, on Driftmark,

28:03.640 --> 28:04.933
in my lord father's castle.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.560
I want my daughters to be
raised in their homeland

28:07.644 --> 28:11.648
with their family
according to their birthright.

28:13.775 --> 28:17.237
And at my end, I want to die
a dragonrider's death.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.864
Not that of some fat country lord.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.774
Soften your knees.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.359
Feet light.

28:56.985 --> 28:59.279
Keep your feet light
and your hands heavy.

28:59.362 --> 29:01.281
This is the stuff, Lyonel.

29:01.990 --> 29:05.410
Lads that learn together,
train together...

29:05.493 --> 29:08.371
knock each other down, pick each other up.

29:08.455 --> 29:11.166
They will certainly form a lifelong bond,
wouldn't you agree?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.334
That is the hope, Your Grace.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.840
Don't stand too upright, my Prince.
You'll get knocked down.

29:30.059 --> 29:30.977
Aegon.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.772
I've won my first bout, Ser Criston.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.983
My opponent sues for mercy.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.737
You'll have a new opponent then,
My Lord of the Straw.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.363
Let's see if you can touch me.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.699
You and your brother.

30:12.560 --> 30:13.853
You're gonna have to do better than that.

30:19.692 --> 30:20.693
Weapons up, boys.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.779
Give your enemies no quarter.

30:25.406 --> 30:27.367
It seems the younger boys
could do better with a bit

30:27.450 --> 30:30.328
of your attention, Ser Criston.

30:30.411 --> 30:33.331
You question my method
of instruction, ser?

30:33.414 --> 30:37.168
I merely suggest that method
be applied to all your pupils.

30:40.630 --> 30:41.548
Very well.

30:45.176 --> 30:47.011
Jacaerys, come here.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.388
You spar with Aegon.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.351
Eldest son against eldest son.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.273
-It's hardly a fair match.
-I know you've never seen

30:58.356 --> 30:59.941
true battle, ser,
but when steel is drawn,

31:00.024 --> 31:01.901
a fair match isn't something
anyone should expect.

31:04.737 --> 31:05.655
Blades up.

31:07.198 --> 31:08.950
Engage.

31:32.682 --> 31:34.601
-Foul play.
-I'll deal with him.

31:37.228 --> 31:39.230
Plant your feet.
You have a height advantage.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.773
Use it. Advance on him...

31:46.321 --> 31:47.238
You!

31:48.948 --> 31:50.074
Close with him.

31:50.992 --> 31:53.202
Press him backward!
Close with him!

31:53.786 --> 31:55.705
Stay on the attack! Use your feet!

31:58.916 --> 32:00.043
Don't let him get up.

32:02.670 --> 32:03.796
Stay on the attack!

32:05.298 --> 32:06.382
Enough!

32:08.259 --> 32:10.887
-You dare put hands on me?
-Aegon!

32:10.970 --> 32:12.847
You forget yourself, Strong.
That is the Prince.

32:12.930 --> 32:14.474
This is what you teach, Cole?

32:17.101 --> 32:18.227
Cruelty...

32:19.312 --> 32:20.855
to the weaker opponent?

32:23.483 --> 32:27.403
Your interest in the princeling's training
is quite unusual, Commander.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.823
Most men would only
have that kind of devotion

32:30.907 --> 32:32.241
toward a cousin...

32:34.077 --> 32:35.203
or a brother...

32:36.204 --> 32:37.121
or a son.

32:54.263 --> 32:55.390
Get back!

32:55.848 --> 32:57.392
Say it again!

32:58.267 --> 32:59.644
Say it again!

32:59.727 --> 33:01.646
Thought as much.

33:04.982 --> 33:06.567
Let him be bathed with a cloth,

33:06.651 --> 33:08.361
and see to it the cook

33:08.444 --> 33:10.571
gives you a good, clear wine to drink.

33:12.824 --> 33:13.741
Princess...

33:14.742 --> 33:17.870
there's been an incident in the yard.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.632
It fills me with unrelenting shame.

33:29.716 --> 33:32.009
So that's what this is about then?

33:32.093 --> 33:35.513
-Your shame.
-Our shame, Harwin!

33:35.596 --> 33:37.223
Shame on the whole of House Strong.

33:37.306 --> 33:40.184
Because I laid my hands
on that insufferable Cole,

33:40.268 --> 33:42.645
-the son of a steward?
-He is a Knight of the Kingsguard now,

33:42.729 --> 33:44.564
-a defender of the crown.
-He assailed Prince Jacaerys,

33:44.647 --> 33:46.441
the future heir to the throne.

33:48.526 --> 33:52.697
You have laid us open to accusations

33:52.780 --> 33:54.532
of an uglier treachery.

33:54.615 --> 33:56.701
And what treachery is that?

33:59.287 --> 34:01.414
Don't play the fool with me, boy.

34:03.040 --> 34:06.210
Your intimacy with the Princess Rhaenyra

34:06.294 --> 34:09.213
is an offense that would
mean exile and death...

34:09.797 --> 34:13.342
for you, for her, for the children!

34:14.510 --> 34:17.054
It is rumor only...

34:18.806 --> 34:20.183
spun by the Princess's rivals.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.351
People have eyes, boy.

34:24.729 --> 34:28.691
Yet His Grace the King, it seems,
will not accept what his eyes see.

34:28.775 --> 34:33.654
This flimsy shield alone
stands between you and the headsman.

34:34.822 --> 34:37.867
The willful blindness of a father
towards his child.

34:37.950 --> 34:40.411
I wish my father affected
a similar blindness.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.747
Have I not these many years?

34:43.414 --> 34:45.583
And yet today, you publicly assaulted

34:45.666 --> 34:48.586
a Knight of the Kingsguard
in the, in the defense of your--

34:51.506 --> 34:54.634
You have your honor and I have mine.

35:02.850 --> 35:04.769
To ease the pain, Princess.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.909
-Thank you.
-You'll feel better in a day or two,

35:19.992 --> 35:21.536
when the milk dries up.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.223
My dear wife.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.016
Princess.

35:45.768 --> 35:47.144
I fell down.

35:49.438 --> 35:52.483
-Where have you been?
-Out with Qarl. Didn't I mention it?

35:54.569 --> 35:56.863
Are you in very much pain?

35:56.946 --> 35:57.864
The milk...

35:59.198 --> 36:01.367
-swells the breasts--
-Would you mind, Ser Qarl?

36:01.450 --> 36:03.161
I would like to speak with my husband.

36:03.244 --> 36:04.829
Of course, Princess.

36:16.382 --> 36:20.428
War is afoot again
in the Stepstones, Rhaenyra.

36:21.345 --> 36:25.725
The Triarchy takes new life
from its alliance with Dorne.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.811
They're waylaying ships and cargo.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.106
Qarl's been fighting there.
He showed me a--

36:35.443 --> 36:39.238
He showed me a sack of sapphires
big as walnuts

36:39.322 --> 36:41.240
he took from the pirate he slew.

36:43.868 --> 36:47.163
after all this time,
this is just what I need,

36:47.246 --> 36:48.915
a little adventure.

36:48.998 --> 36:53.044
A good, honest battle
to enliven my blood again.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.297
He says there is a Tyroshi general there,

36:56.380 --> 36:58.132
a giant, they say,

36:58.215 --> 37:02.720
who dyes his beard purple
and wears women's frocks.

37:06.682 --> 37:08.559
A few months, maybe...

37:13.314 --> 37:15.232
To be back at sea.

37:17.234 --> 37:19.111
Are you mad?

37:20.071 --> 37:21.989
Do you know what's happened...

37:22.782 --> 37:24.742
while you've been guzzling all the ale
in Flea Bottom?

37:24.825 --> 37:26.494
Gods know what besides?

37:27.578 --> 37:29.872
Dark rumors are hunting us, Laenor.

37:29.956 --> 37:32.041
They nip at our heels.

37:32.124 --> 37:36.963
Questions about our sons' parentage.

37:37.922 --> 37:41.217
Vile, disgusting insinuations.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.885
Insinuations, are they?

37:43.427 --> 37:45.388
They are our sons!

37:45.471 --> 37:47.390
Yours and mine.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.559
And their true father
will not abandon them now

37:50.643 --> 37:54.188
to go carousing through the Narrow Sea,
waggling his sword

37:54.271 --> 37:56.482
-and winking at his sailors.
-I am a knight...

37:58.859 --> 38:01.028
and a warrior.

38:01.112 --> 38:06.242
And I have played
my part here, faithfully...

38:07.326 --> 38:10.246
for 10 years.

38:11.497 --> 38:14.417
-I am owed some--
-You are owed nothing!

38:15.543 --> 38:20.506
For 10 years, you have indulged
yourself at court,

38:20.589 --> 38:23.050
bought the finest horses,

38:23.134 --> 38:25.469
drunk the rarest of wines,

38:25.553 --> 38:27.263
fucked the lustiest boys.

38:27.346 --> 38:30.683
This was our agreement.
I have not begrudged you.

38:31.642 --> 38:32.560
But...

38:34.395 --> 38:38.649
you do not desert your post
when the storm lashes.

38:38.733 --> 38:43.279
The wise sailor flees
the storm as it gathers.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.958
Very well then.
I command you.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.628
As your Princess
and the heir to the throne,

38:59.712 --> 39:01.922
you are commanded to remain

39:02.006 --> 39:04.925
in King's Landing and at my side.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.531
It's been eight years, sweetling.

39:29.158 --> 39:32.036
-Half of them never do, you know?
-What?

39:35.039 --> 39:36.165
Hatch.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.669
Will they let me stay?

39:42.088 --> 39:43.631
Will who let you stay?

39:44.256 --> 39:45.800
The Prince of Pentos.

39:46.967 --> 39:48.511
I don't understand.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.639
He wants you and father...

39:53.099 --> 39:54.433
and Baela...

39:55.101 --> 39:56.894
'cause you have dragons.

40:01.398 --> 40:05.111
There is more than one way
to bind yourself to a dragon.

40:05.194 --> 40:09.782
I was without one until I was 15 years old

40:09.865 --> 40:13.994
and now I ride Vhagar,
the largest in the world.

40:17.414 --> 40:19.250
You have a harder road.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.210
Baela's dragon was born to her.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.422
But if you wish to be a rider,

40:25.506 --> 40:28.384
you must claim that right.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.012
Your father would tell you the same.

40:33.597 --> 40:35.349
Father ignores me.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.399
He's doing his best.

41:21.604 --> 41:23.522
Laenor has written.

41:24.982 --> 41:27.109
Rhaenyra has delivered another son.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.155
Does your brother mention if this one

41:31.238 --> 41:33.782
also bears a marked
but entirely coincidental

41:33.866 --> 41:36.493
resemblance to the Commander
of the City Watch?

41:36.577 --> 41:39.872
He seems to have left that detail out.

41:42.917 --> 41:45.461
I miss my brother, Daemon.

41:47.546 --> 41:49.215
As I think do you.

41:50.925 --> 41:53.469
I miss Westerosi strongwine.

41:54.845 --> 41:57.973
It could be depended on for a few hours
of peaceful oblivion.

41:59.683 --> 42:02.019
This amber shit that they drink here.

42:09.902 --> 42:11.946
Do you never long for home?

42:12.029 --> 42:13.447
No.

42:13.530 --> 42:16.116
-I don't believe you.
-Believe what you please.

42:16.200 --> 42:20.287
You laud the virtues of Pentos,
but you have no interest in it.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.915
If you did, you would venture
into the city, but instead,

42:22.998 --> 42:26.460
you spend your time here,
in the library, reading accounts

42:26.543 --> 42:29.880
of the same dead dragonlords
whose legacy you claim

42:29.964 --> 42:31.423
has no hold on you.

42:31.507 --> 42:33.968
Didn't know I was being
so minutely observed.

42:34.051 --> 42:35.594
You do not sleep.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.097
Well, how can I with you
haunting my every move?

42:41.558 --> 42:44.979
Life has, I know, disappointed you.

42:45.062 --> 42:47.481
Perhaps, I too, am not the wife
you would've wished for yourself.

42:47.564 --> 42:48.774
Laena.

42:48.857 --> 42:50.693
It does not pain me.

42:51.652 --> 42:53.570
I have made my peace.

42:57.491 --> 42:59.034
But you are more than this, Daemon.

43:01.578 --> 43:04.456
The man I married was more than this.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.633
It is Lord Blackwood's
contention, therefore,

43:14.717 --> 43:16.343
that the Brackens moved
the boundary stones

43:16.427 --> 43:17.761
in the dead of the night

43:17.845 --> 43:20.306
and put their horses
to graze in his field.

43:20.389 --> 43:22.975
Why was this issue not
brought before Lord Grover?

43:23.058 --> 43:26.145
Has he grown so feeble
he cannot settle a quarrel over rocks?

43:26.228 --> 43:30.607
I've heard tale that Lord Grover's son
now rules Riverrun in all but name.

43:30.691 --> 43:34.987
Well, he is also a Tully
and this remains a Tully problem.

43:35.070 --> 43:36.196
I would agree.

43:37.281 --> 43:39.700
-If we may move on, my lords--
-And yet,

43:39.783 --> 43:41.243
the Brackens and the Blackwoods

43:41.327 --> 43:43.329
will use any excuse
to spill each other's blood.

43:46.623 --> 43:49.918
So this dispute bears looking into.

43:50.002 --> 43:51.503
There will be countryfolk who know

43:51.587 --> 43:53.881
where the lines have
been drawn for generations.

43:53.964 --> 43:55.215
That is easy enough.

43:56.425 --> 43:57.843
Of course.

44:00.137 --> 44:01.263
Ser Tyland.

44:03.015 --> 44:04.725
We should address

44:04.808 --> 44:07.644
the latest developments
in the Stepstones, my lords.

44:07.728 --> 44:10.439
Will we ever be shut
of that blasted place?

44:10.522 --> 44:12.316
If you ask me, I think the Blackwoods have

44:12.399 --> 44:13.901
-the upper hand.
-No.

44:13.984 --> 44:16.362
We've moved on to the Stepstones,
Lord Beesbury.

44:16.445 --> 44:19.907
And the Triarchy's
new alliance with Dorne.

44:19.990 --> 44:22.451
I was hoping
our negotiations with Sunspear

44:22.534 --> 44:24.453
might persuade
them to see reason.

44:24.536 --> 44:28.707
To trust a Martell
is to be disappointed.

44:28.791 --> 44:31.293
And where, I wonder,
is our Prince Daemon?

44:31.377 --> 44:33.837
Or I suppose I should call him King,
as he styled himself

44:33.921 --> 44:36.548
when he won a battle there... once.

44:36.632 --> 44:39.385
That was a decade ago and he has
since left the region undefended.

44:39.468 --> 44:41.178
We have left it undefended.

44:41.261 --> 44:44.223
There should've been fortifications built,

44:44.306 --> 44:46.141
watchtowers, a fleet of ships,

44:46.225 --> 44:48.936
a garrison of soldiers
sent to hold our ground.

44:49.019 --> 44:50.145
We cannot afford it.

44:52.481 --> 44:55.776
Our coffers are great, but not infinite.

44:56.485 --> 44:58.445
We must consider the cost to our subjects.

44:58.529 --> 45:01.448
-I must agree.
-The cost of war is greater.

45:03.951 --> 45:08.080
But we have been lax and the old monster
now lifts its head.

45:13.419 --> 45:14.503
Let us be finished.

45:15.921 --> 45:17.214
Yes.

45:21.760 --> 45:22.594
Wait.

45:23.679 --> 45:25.222
I wish to speak.

45:26.557 --> 45:27.683
Be seated.

45:37.025 --> 45:39.903
I have felt the...

45:41.155 --> 45:42.364
strife...

45:43.407 --> 45:45.742
between our families of late, my Queen.

45:48.454 --> 45:52.207
And for any offense given by mine,
I apologize.

45:54.376 --> 45:56.503
But we are one house.

45:57.629 --> 46:00.132
And long before that,

46:00.215 --> 46:01.467
we were friends.

46:07.848 --> 46:10.517
My son Jacaerys will inherit
the Iron Throne after me.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.520
I propose we betroth him
to your daughter, Helaena.

46:15.147 --> 46:17.065
Ally ourselves...

46:17.774 --> 46:19.318
once and for all.

46:20.235 --> 46:21.945
Let them rule together.

46:22.029 --> 46:24.573
A most judicious proposition.

46:29.077 --> 46:32.623
Additionally, if Syrax brings forth
another clutch of eggs,

46:32.706 --> 46:35.125
your son Aemond will have
his choice of them...

46:36.418 --> 46:38.962
a symbol of our goodwill.

46:42.049 --> 46:43.342
Rhaenyra.

46:51.266 --> 46:53.852
Oh, Seven Hells.

46:56.146 --> 46:57.773
My dear...

46:57.856 --> 47:00.234
a dragon's egg is a handsome gift.

47:01.902 --> 47:05.489
The King and I thank you for your offer
and we will consider it duly.

47:05.572 --> 47:07.491
You must rest now, husband.

47:10.786 --> 47:12.120
Yes.

47:18.502 --> 47:22.297
How sweetly the fox speaks
when it's been cornered by the hounds.

47:22.381 --> 47:25.425
-She is sincere.
-She is desperate.

47:25.509 --> 47:27.719
She feels the earth
washing away beneath her feet

47:27.803 --> 47:30.138
and now she expects us
to ignore her transgressions

47:30.222 --> 47:33.475
and for me to marry my only daughter
to one of her...

47:33.559 --> 47:35.310
plain-featured sons.

47:35.394 --> 47:37.938
The proposal is a good one, my Queen.

47:39.064 --> 47:40.649
We're a family.

47:40.732 --> 47:43.068
Let us put aside these childish quarrels.

47:43.151 --> 47:45.487
Join hands and be stronger for it.

47:46.697 --> 47:48.615
You may do as you wish, husband...

47:49.700 --> 47:52.035
when I am cold in my grave.

47:52.911 --> 47:53.829
Alicent.

47:55.914 --> 47:56.832
Alicent!

48:20.606 --> 48:22.524
I do not need the blanket--

48:26.111 --> 48:27.654
The Hand, Your Grace.

48:28.363 --> 48:31.283
-The King is resting.
-I will see him.

48:32.534 --> 48:33.660
Lean forward.

48:41.168 --> 48:43.962
I'm being endlessly fussed over, Lyonel.

48:44.713 --> 48:47.257
It's a wonder I can visit the privy alone.

48:48.091 --> 48:49.009
Your Grace.

48:50.260 --> 48:52.262
What might this errand
be about, Lord Lyonel?

48:55.223 --> 48:56.475
Your Grace, I feel...

48:59.144 --> 49:01.688
I have come to resign my position
as Hand of the King.

49:03.357 --> 49:05.025
The episode in the yard this morning.

49:05.108 --> 49:08.153
My son Harwin has disgraced himself

49:08.236 --> 49:11.198
and every fishwife in King's Landing
will soon be telling the tale.

49:11.281 --> 49:15.494
Young Harwin's outburst was unfortunate,
it's true.

49:15.577 --> 49:17.245
But he's been expelled
from the City Watch.

49:17.329 --> 49:18.705
That seems punishment enough.

49:18.789 --> 49:21.124
Forgive me, Your Grace, it is not.

49:28.298 --> 49:32.469
You have served me
faithfully for many years,

49:32.552 --> 49:33.762
10 as Hand.

49:35.389 --> 49:39.476
Your advice has been sage,
unmarked by self-interest...

49:40.268 --> 49:42.979
which stands in contrast to all others.

49:44.314 --> 49:45.857
You speak kind words...

49:47.234 --> 49:49.194
but there is a shadow over my house

49:49.277 --> 49:51.488
and it grows ever darker.

49:51.571 --> 49:54.116
I can no longer serve you with integrity.

49:55.617 --> 49:57.160
What is this shadow?

49:58.578 --> 50:00.956
Name it, if it casts such a gloom.

50:01.039 --> 50:05.585
Yes, we must have your reasoning
in plain language.

50:13.760 --> 50:14.886
I cannot.

50:16.805 --> 50:18.390
Then I cannot accept this.

50:18.473 --> 50:20.434
-My dear husband--
-I said no!

50:21.810 --> 50:24.354
-If you insist, my King.
-I do.

50:25.355 --> 50:27.315
You will continue in your service
to the crown.

50:30.068 --> 50:32.279
I would then ask leave
to take my son from court

50:32.362 --> 50:35.282
and escort him back to the family seat
at Harrenhal.

50:35.365 --> 50:37.367
He is my heir

50:37.451 --> 50:39.244
and will be lord of Harren's castle
one day.

50:39.327 --> 50:41.872
It is time he assumed his duties there.

50:45.041 --> 50:45.959
Do it.

51:06.938 --> 51:08.899
Aren't you gonna help me?

51:48.396 --> 51:51.233
I took the liberty of beginning
without you, Your Grace.

51:51.316 --> 51:54.069
It seemed a sin to let
such a pie grow cold.

51:54.152 --> 51:57.030
You did wisely, Lord Larys.

51:57.113 --> 51:59.699
Though you had no such worry
about the wine, surely.

51:59.783 --> 52:02.536
Meat without wine is also a sin.

52:08.291 --> 52:10.919
It's been my duty to tell you
of happenings about the castle,

52:11.002 --> 52:13.922
but tonight you know, and I do not.

52:14.881 --> 52:17.634
The King had an audience with my father.

52:17.717 --> 52:19.219
He attempted to resign his post.

52:20.345 --> 52:21.680
I thought as much.

52:22.931 --> 52:26.518
His honor's always been a millstone
about his esteemed neck.

52:28.728 --> 52:30.689
Interesting you said "attempted"?

52:30.772 --> 52:32.691
My lord husband refused to accept.

52:34.025 --> 52:37.988
Then he fell short of confessing
my brother's... transgressions.

52:38.071 --> 52:40.282
With his eruption in the yard,
your brother

52:40.365 --> 52:42.492
all but confessed the truth himself.

52:42.576 --> 52:44.703
Truth has many flavors, Your Grace.

52:45.871 --> 52:48.540
Do you expect the King to doom
his dear daughter to exile,

52:48.623 --> 52:50.792
or even--

52:52.043 --> 52:53.169
Talya, not now.

53:00.552 --> 53:04.139
It's a willful blindness, the King.

53:04.222 --> 53:05.807
I mean, you'd surely
suffer the same affliction,

53:05.891 --> 53:07.809
-if it came to it.
-I would not.

53:09.728 --> 53:12.606
Lord Lyonel is to escort
Ser Harwin back to Harrenhal

53:12.689 --> 53:16.067
to watch over his seat whilst he continues
to serve as Hand.

53:16.693 --> 53:21.406
But the Hand is compromised
by the acts of his son.

53:21.489 --> 53:26.453
My father cannot give unbiased
counsel to the King.

53:26.536 --> 53:29.831
It is now that I most rue
the absence of my own father.

53:29.915 --> 53:31.791
He wouldn't hesitate
to speak the truth to the King.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.418
If Otto Hightower were still Hand--

53:33.501 --> 53:35.921
You cannot say, my Queen,
that your father would be

53:36.004 --> 53:37.547
impartial in this matter.

53:37.631 --> 53:39.758
No, but he would be partial to me!

53:49.267 --> 53:52.187
In all of King's Landing,
is there no one to take my side?

54:18.421 --> 54:21.549
What a collection of heroes
I have before me.

54:25.595 --> 54:27.263
A murderer...

54:27.931 --> 54:29.975
a deviant...

54:30.517 --> 54:32.435
a traitor to the crown.

54:33.228 --> 54:37.399
For your crimes, you've been sentenced
to death by hanging.

54:39.401 --> 54:41.319
What do you want with us?

54:44.531 --> 54:47.450
I am prepared to offer you mercy...

54:49.160 --> 54:52.080
if you're prepared to pay a little price.

55:16.271 --> 55:17.939
Push, my Lady.

55:18.023 --> 55:19.899
Push! Push!

55:19.983 --> 55:21.067
Push!

55:22.652 --> 55:25.196
-You must push!
-Push!

55:27.240 --> 55:29.492
It needs to come now!

55:29.576 --> 55:30.702
Push!

55:32.829 --> 55:34.372
Push!

55:35.165 --> 55:37.333
You must push now, my Lady!

55:37.417 --> 55:39.753
Push!

55:58.188 --> 56:00.106
I've reached the limit of my art.

56:02.067 --> 56:03.610
The child will not come.

56:06.446 --> 56:08.364
My brave girl.

56:13.912 --> 56:15.830
I am very sorry, my Prince.

56:17.290 --> 56:19.209
We could lay open the womb...

56:20.293 --> 56:22.504
try to remove the infant

56:22.587 --> 56:23.922
by way of the blade.

56:25.465 --> 56:28.510
But I cannot say
for a surety whether it lives.

56:28.593 --> 56:30.512
Would the mother survive it?

56:32.388 --> 56:33.932
No.

57:04.379 --> 57:07.298
Vhagar, dracarys.

57:11.928 --> 57:13.263
Dracarys!

57:15.890 --> 57:17.642
Dracarys!

57:21.771 --> 57:23.314
Dracarys.

57:24.149 --> 57:26.067
Dracarys!

57:28.278 --> 57:29.779
Dracarys.

57:50.425 --> 57:51.551
Laena!

58:14.574 --> 58:16.743
Be good to your mother, lads.

58:16.826 --> 58:18.369
I'll visit when I can.

58:21.915 --> 58:23.833
But that may be some time.

58:27.253 --> 58:28.379
Jace.

58:35.303 --> 58:36.638
I will return...

58:39.390 --> 58:40.767
I promise.

58:55.657 --> 58:59.535
I will be a stranger when we meet again.

59:16.678 --> 59:17.720
Princess.

59:39.909 --> 59:42.620
We will exchange letters by raven.

59:42.704 --> 59:46.291
-Won't that be fun?
-Is Harwin Strong my father?

59:50.503 --> 59:52.046
Am I a bastard?

59:56.718 --> 59:58.636
You are a Targaryen.

1:00:00.346 --> 1:00:01.889
That's all that matters.

1:00:26.581 --> 1:00:27.498
A word?

1:00:34.464 --> 1:00:35.840
I take it he's gone.

1:00:38.343 --> 1:00:40.011
We're finished here. We're leaving.

1:00:43.056 --> 1:00:45.933
What of your offer? Jace and Helaena?

1:00:46.017 --> 1:00:47.685
I have been undermined...

1:00:48.644 --> 1:00:51.856
and made a spectacle.
They whisper about me in the corridors.

1:00:51.939 --> 1:00:54.275
Well, I leave them to it.

1:00:58.279 --> 1:00:59.822
To Dragonstone then?

1:01:00.490 --> 1:01:02.033
We should've left years ago.

1:01:07.997 --> 1:01:09.791
What of your position?

1:01:09.874 --> 1:01:12.126
You've always said
if you were absent from court,

1:01:12.210 --> 1:01:15.129
she would pour her honey
in your father's ear.

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:19.008
The wise sailor flees
the storm as it gathers.

1:01:20.885 --> 1:01:22.804
Laenor...

1:01:24.222 --> 1:01:25.681
bring him.

1:01:27.517 --> 1:01:29.602
We'll need every sword we can muster.

1:02:46.179 --> 1:02:49.599
Fire! I will burn!

1:02:49.682 --> 1:02:52.310
Harwin! Harwin!

1:03:16.834 --> 1:03:20.755
What are children, but a weakness?

1:03:24.008 --> 1:03:25.551
A folly?

1:03:26.802 --> 1:03:28.596
A futility?

1:03:33.851 --> 1:03:36.020
Through them, you imagine you cheat

1:03:36.103 --> 1:03:39.273
the great darkness of its victory.

1:03:54.455 --> 1:03:59.418
You will persist forever,
in some form or another.

1:04:02.255 --> 1:04:05.341
As if they will keep you from the dust.

1:04:16.477 --> 1:04:21.065
But for them,
you surrender what you should not.

1:04:23.943 --> 1:04:27.738
You may know what is
the right thing to be done,

1:04:27.822 --> 1:04:31.200
but love stays the hand.

1:04:40.126 --> 1:04:41.252
Love...

1:04:43.462 --> 1:04:45.381
is a downfall.

1:04:50.428 --> 1:04:54.390
Best to make your way
through life unencumbered...

1:04:55.683 --> 1:04:57.435
if you ask me.

1:05:00.646 --> 1:05:01.939
They're dead.

1:05:02.023 --> 1:05:04.942
You've heard the stories
of Harrenhal, Your Grace.

1:05:06.736 --> 1:05:08.779
It was built in hubris by Harren the Black

1:05:08.863 --> 1:05:11.240
as a monument to his own greatness.

1:05:11.324 --> 1:05:14.243
Blood mixed into the mortar.

1:05:16.537 --> 1:05:18.873
It is said to be a cursed place.

1:05:19.624 --> 1:05:23.419
That it passes judgment
on all who pass beneath its gates.

1:05:23.502 --> 1:05:25.129
You--

1:05:25.212 --> 1:05:27.131
You passed judgment.

1:05:28.841 --> 1:05:30.176
The Queen makes a wish.

1:05:32.136 --> 1:05:35.765
What servant of the realm
would not strive to fulfill it?

1:05:37.767 --> 1:05:41.312
I assume you will write
to your father now?

1:05:43.356 --> 1:05:44.273
Larys...

1:05:45.524 --> 1:05:47.735
I did not wish for this.

1:05:49.987 --> 1:05:53.866
I feel certain you will reward me...

1:05:55.660 --> 1:05:57.953
when the time is right.
