inject a barium sulfate slurry

fluoroscope the slurry

06:23.259 --> 06:24.715
- [ Hodgins ] Why?
- [ Brennan ] Because, othenNise,

06:24.802 --> 06:27.214
we’d be looking at
the mold of a human body...

06:27.304 --> 06:29.215

06:29.306 --> 06:30.807

06:30.891 --> 06:32.722
[ Hodgins ]
Natural fibers, like cotton,

06:32.810 --> 06:34.641

- in, say, I don’t know,
four months?
- But not bones.

If we can figure out what
happened to the victim’s

we may be able to figure out
what happened to him.

07:21.609 --> 07:24.396
All right, so the victim
was lying on his back,

07:24.486 --> 07:26.022

07:26.113 --> 07:29.321
He must have been knocked
unconscious, paralyzed
or already dead.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.532
What’s your thinking?
If he was conscious,

07:31.619 --> 07:34.281
he would have
curled up in pain
or tried to crawl away.

07:42.338 --> 07:43.919

07:44.006 --> 07:46.622
Is there any such thing
as a dental tattoo?

08:09.365 --> 08:11.071

frustrating...

12:20.240 --> 12:22.401
where the tendons and ligaments
were replicated.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.983
Right. But can we get
anything useful from it?

12:25.078 --> 12:27.364
Well, the victim
had turned-out hips
and high arches.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.663
That, along with
the muscle attachments
at the shoulders and hips,

12:29.750 --> 12:31.411
suggests that he was
a ballet dancer.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.664
There are nicks on the lateral
and posterior surfaces.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.460
Okay. Why don’t you just
flip it over so we can
get a better look?

12:39.551 --> 12:41.542
I would never flip over
a real skeleton.

12:41.637 --> 12:43.593
Ah, lucky for us
this is a replica.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.511
Come on, grab a limb.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.681
[ Sighs ]
Okay.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.687
Hey, that was kinda fun.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.605
These nicks suggest
that he was stabbed.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.273
Or impaled.

12:57.361 --> 12:59.443
We haven’t proven murder yet,
Mr. Vaziri.

12:59.529 --> 13:03.522
It’s possible that
the victim blundered
into a construction site,

13:03.617 --> 13:06.575
fell into the foundation,
impaling himself on rebar.

13:12.793 --> 13:17.412
Well, this is the place where
the guy with the, uh, tattoo
on his tooth— Robert Pearson—

13:17.506 --> 13:18.916
studied before he left.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.919
That’s assuming that
Robert Pearson is
the only missing person...

13:22.010 --> 13:27.095
to have a tattoo
of a hip-hop dancer
on his left front incisor.

13:27.182 --> 13:31.471
- [Woman] Holding up.
- Well, I admit that the odds
favor your conclusion.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.348
- Mm-hmm.
- No family? No job?

13:34.439 --> 13:36.145
[ Booth ]
He hasn’t been here in a year,
all right?

13:36.233 --> 13:39.145
The skeleton isn’t
the only thing missing.
This guy’s off the grid.

13:39.236 --> 13:42.148
Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.
What are you doing?
Are you new?

13:42.239 --> 13:44.275
[ Booth ]
Wow. She’s mean.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.732
Ballet is a rigorous
vocation, Booth.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.279
- [ Gasps ]
- Whoa.

13:52.374 --> 13:54.956
Bad posture, bad hands—
bad partner.

13:55.043 --> 13:57.534
Are you an eagle?
Excuse me?

13:57.629 --> 13:59.085
Are you an eagle?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.128
No.

14:01.216 --> 14:05.710
Then stop making claws.
Fingers flat on all lifts.
That hurts, right?

14:05.804 --> 14:09.422
Okay, I don’t really have
any problem saying this woman
killed somebody. You?

14:09.516 --> 14:12.258
Well, she’s quite
small physically.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.934
| suggest you learn
how to perform a lift.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.137
She’s mean.

14:19.317 --> 14:22.559
Whoa. Okay, well, there’s
your evidence of strength.

14:22.654 --> 14:24.610
That’s how you
perform a lift.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.027
What do you want? I’m trying
to bring beauty to the world,
if that’s okay with you?

14:31.121 --> 14:33.578
We just have
a few questions about one
of your former students.

14:33.665 --> 14:36.828
Which former student?
I have quite a number
of former students.

14:36.918 --> 14:40.376
- Robert Pearson.
- Robert?

14:40.464 --> 14:42.295
I hope you’re here
to tell me he’s dead.

14:44.968 --> 14:48.586
- Today is your lucky day.
- Why do you wish him
to be dead?

14:48.722 --> 14:51.964
Because he is the one who broke
this ankle and set my career
back three years.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.892
You-You want me to break down
and cry because Robert’s dead?

14:59.983 --> 15:01.439
People die.
Bad things happen.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.980
Oh, so you blame Robert
for breaking your ankle?
Yes.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.029
An accident not too different
from what you saw today.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.696
But I’ll be just fine
in six months.

15:08.784 --> 15:12.072
Your gait and the contour
of your ankle...

15:12.162 --> 15:14.528
indicate that you’ve suffered
compound fractures...

15:14.623 --> 15:16.909
to the medial
and the lateral malleolus.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.412
Lateral “mallebious.”
Well, that sounds
pretty serious, huh?

15:19.503 --> 15:22.415
Well, she’ll never be
able to properly execute
a fouetté again.

15:22.506 --> 15:24.918
A career-ender, huh?

15:25.008 --> 15:26.544
You don’t seem
too surprised.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.918
Doctors say things all the time.
It doesn’t make it true.
[ Booth ] Right.

15:30.055 --> 15:33.172
Your dad owns a construction
company, right?
Yeah. So?

15:33.266 --> 15:36.429
So you must know your way
around a construction site
pretty well.

15:36.520 --> 15:41.059
You know, Robert was just found
in a recently completed site.

15:41.149 --> 15:44.186
Okay, this— this is crazy.
I could never kill anyone.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.563
It’s not crazy.
You know, people do this
all the time.

15:46.655 --> 15:48.191
They get mad,
a little too mad.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.442
I don’t think it was actually
Robert’s fault that you fell.

15:50.534 --> 15:53.776
lt-lt was a pas de deux.
He dropped me.
That is not my fault.

15:53.870 --> 15:58.284
Given your height,
you are well over the optimal
weight for ballerina.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.617
It’d be difficult for anybody
to perform a proper pas de deux
with you.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.459
Are you calling me fat?
No, no.

16:03.547 --> 16:06.664
For a member
of the general public,
you’re actually quite thin.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.965
- But by ballerina standards—
- You bitch!

16:09.052 --> 16:11.668
VVhoa,ho,ho.
Okay, temper, temper!

16:11.763 --> 16:13.879
Look, if you’re gonna charge me
with something, get on with it.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.714
OthenNise, l have
a class to teach.

16:21.356 --> 16:24.314
[Arastoo ]
There are remodeled circular
microfractures on the skull.

16:24.401 --> 16:27.313
So someone struck him
on the head with a twirling—

16:27.404 --> 16:29.645
What twirls and is good
for hitting on the head?

16:29.739 --> 16:32.446
Very thin cardboard
on asphalt?

16:33.869 --> 16:37.828
So he left ballet to become
a spinning-on-his-head dancer.

16:37.914 --> 16:41.452
Check this out.
Initial analysis of
the powdered bone dust...

16:41.543 --> 16:44.580
revealed traces
of Blastomyces dermat/t/Uis.

16:44.671 --> 16:48.255
It’s a fascinating fungus
that quite literally eats bone.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.504
So that’s what happened to
the rest of his skeleton?
A fungus ate it?

16:51.595 --> 16:53.005
Where’d the fungus
come from?

16:53.096 --> 16:55.462
- lt must’ve been introduced
to the bone before he died.
- Ouch.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.047
Well, it’s bad for him,
but good for us.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.929
I mean, the fungus
probably hitched a ride
on the murder weapon.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.854
Now, check this out.
| crossed-checked the C.D.C.’s
infectious disease map...

17:03.940 --> 17:05.851
for recent outbreaks
of the fungus in the area.

17:05.942 --> 17:09.730
There was an outbreak
in Kalorama Park
about six months ago.

17:09.863 --> 17:13.447
It fits the time frame.
Kalorama Park’s loaded
with street performers.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.240
Perfect place for a guy
to spin on his head.
Added twist—

17:16.328 --> 17:20.867
as well as the fungus
in the bone dust, I found
flecks of bronze in his wounds.

17:20.957 --> 17:25.451
So we’ll tell Booth to keep
an eye out for a bronze murder
weapon in Kalorama Park.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.287

17:35.639 --> 17:37.095
J Break it on down

17:37.182 --> 17:38.718
J Wrink/ing my school clothes
Marshmallows and rocky road JJ

17:38.808 --> 17:40.423
lt must’ve been
quite a comedown...

17:40.518 --> 17:43.134
to have been working for
a professional ballet company...

17:43.230 --> 17:44.936
to, you know, dancing for tips.

17:45.023 --> 17:49.187
For centuries, busking has been
a viable way for creative people
to earn a living.

17:49.277 --> 17:52.064
No barriers
between the performer
and the audience,

17:52.155 --> 17:54.646
with payment coming
only after the performance.

17:54.741 --> 17:58.950
It’s entertainment in its
purest, unfettered form.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.028
JJ [Backgrounds Man Singing Rap,
indistinct ]

18:01.122 --> 18:03.659
I bet he drove
his parents crazy.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.332
JJ [ Continues]

18:22.769 --> 18:26.102
The fluidity
with which he moves
should not be possible.

18:26.189 --> 18:29.181
It appears as if
he has no bones.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.359
Well, that’d put you out
of business, wouldn’t it?

18:32.445 --> 18:34.936
JJ [ Continues]

18:40.495 --> 18:43.783
J We never cry
about the weather;

18:43.873 --> 18:47.365
J We’re just stuck
kissin’ in the rain JJ

18:47.460 --> 18:50.748
We should talk to some
of the buskers, Booth.

18:50.839 --> 18:53.876
Excuse me.
F.B.|. Special Agent Booth.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.504
This here is, uh,
Dr. Temperance Brennan
from the Jeffersonian.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.334
We just wanna ask you
a few questions.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.842
We’re just performing.
This isn’t federal land.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.923
The FBI. has no
jurisdiction over us.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.134
All right, just simmer
down there, uh—

19:05.228 --> 19:06.729
Beveny.
Beveﬂy.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.895
We don’t want to
take away from your, uh—
What did you call it?

19:09.024 --> 19:11.185
Pure, unfettered entertainment.
Exacﬂy.

19:11.276 --> 19:14.018
We got off on
the wrong foot here.
I’m Johnny.

19:14.112 --> 19:17.104
Johnny Wizard.
And this is Derrick.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.450
Derrick here keeps
the park clean for us.

19:19.534 --> 19:22.116
- Derrick.
- You might wanna take
better care of your watch.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.694
- Gimme that back.
- Oh. That was very good.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.575
How about this?

19:29.336 --> 19:32.123
Look, Booth.
Yeah. Look.
Hey, an ear flower.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.295
Great. You guys
recognize this man?

19:35.467 --> 19:37.799
Yeah, that’s Robert.
Is he in trouble?

19:38.762 --> 19:40.298
Robert is dead.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.176
- Oh, no.
- Man, that’s terrible.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.849
I told you it was weird
he just disappeared like that.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.552
Then why didn’t you
report him missing?

19:49.647 --> 19:52.184
Weird is just weird.
It’s not suspicious.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.607
We thought he went legit,
left us behind.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.730
You and, uh, Robert have
a little thing there, Beverly?

19:56.821 --> 19:59.654
Only business.
I played, he danced.

19:59.741 --> 20:03.029
- What happened to him?
- Uh, that’s what we’re
investigating right now.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.781
- When was the last time
you guys saw him?
- Six months ago.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.739
I think this
would really suit you.

20:08.833 --> 20:13.202
- That is my bracelet.
- No, I hate magic.
Hate magic.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.708
- Did he have any enemies?
- Everybody loved Robert.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.131
- What about Russell?
- [ Booth ] Who’s Russell?

20:22.639 --> 20:26.177
- [ Derrick] They got into a fight
about prime dance spots.
- But they worked it out.

20:26.267 --> 20:29.805
All right, well, listen, if you hear
of anything, here’s my card.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.978
- Just give me a call.
- You got it.

20:33.775 --> 20:37.643
Whoa, easy! Okay, you know,
it’s a federal offense to steal
an FBI. agent’s |.D.

20:37.737 --> 20:41.104
I could shoot you if
I wanted to, you know that?
Shootyou.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.911
Hodgins found bronze
particulates at the site.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.579
[ Booth ]
Yeah, so?

20:50.667 --> 20:52.658
This statue seems to be
made of bronze.

20:52.752 --> 20:57.496
Perhaps some of those
sharp edges are responsible
for the injuries we discovered.

20:58.883 --> 21:00.134
- Ohh!
- Whoa!

21:06.224 --> 21:08.761
Mr. Milford,
I’m Dr. Lance Sweets.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.342
I’m a psychologist.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.973
And the reason
I’m talking to you...

21:12.063 --> 21:14.600
is that every time
the FBI. agent | work with
asked you a question,

21:14.691 --> 21:17.228
you spouted Shakespearean
verse at him.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.570
He doesn’t speak Shakespearean.

21:19.654 --> 21:23.192
We found traces of bronze
on a murder victim.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.071
Hmm. You’re covered in bronze.

21:27.162 --> 21:32.577
Uh, what I think is that
you suffer from an untreated
dissociative disorder,

21:32.667 --> 21:36.330
wherein the only way
that you can communicate
is through Shakespeare.

21:36.421 --> 21:38.707
So, um—

21:42.093 --> 21:46.382
“An honest tale speeds best
being plainly told.”

21:49.976 --> 21:52.718
“Truth is truth
to the end of reckoning.”

21:52.812 --> 21:58.102
You’re talkin’. Okay, uh,
regarding the homicide
of Robert Pearson,

21:58.193 --> 22:02.527
“There is special providence
in the fall of a sparrow.”

22:08.953 --> 22:14.164
“By Isis, I will give thee
bloody teeth if thou with
Robert paragon again.”

22:14.250 --> 22:17.617
Oh, okay.
So you’re saying that Robert
wasn’t an innocent victim.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.204
Right.

22:22.842 --> 22:28.337
Uh, “But were we burdened
with like weight of pain,

22:28.431 --> 22:32.094
as much or more
we should ourselves complain.”

22:33.770 --> 22:36.512
“This is the short
and long of it.”
Yeah.

22:36.606 --> 22:39.814
“There is no honor
amongst thieves.”

22:39.901 --> 22:42.688
Oh, he’s a thief.
What kind of thief was he?

22:44.572 --> 22:47.439
“One may smile and smile
and be a villain.”

22:49.452 --> 22:52.489
“A cutpurse of the empire
and the rule,

22:52.580 --> 22:56.368
that from a shelf
the precious diadem stole...

22:56.459 --> 22:58.950
and put it in his pocket.”

23:00.129 --> 23:02.381
Robert Pearson was a thief,
a cutpurse.

23:02.465 --> 23:05.628
That’s a—
That’s a pickpocket, right?

23:05.718 --> 23:07.549
He-He worked with someone,

23:07.637 --> 23:11.129
he betrayed him, and—

23:11.224 --> 23:14.432
“Where the offense is,
let the great ax fall.”

23:15.603 --> 23:17.218
Hmm.

23:17.313 --> 23:23.479
Well, “I can no other answer
make but thanks and thanks.”

23:23.570 --> 23:26.812
“How far that little candle
throws his beam,

23:26.906 --> 23:30.694
so shines a good deed
in a naughty world.”

23:32.287 --> 23:34.949
Well, thank you.

23:36.207 --> 23:38.619
There are nicks to the right tibia,
femur and ilium,

23:38.710 --> 23:40.746
the back of the 10th rib
on the left side,

23:40.837 --> 23:44.204
the left transverse process of the T6
and the right scapula.

23:44.299 --> 23:46.085
These marks are congruent
with impaling.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.917
- But none suggest cause of death.
- Maybe he bled out.

23:49.012 --> 23:53.676
The bronze particulates I found
didn’t come from the paint on
the Shakespearean loony-tunes.

23:53.808 --> 23:55.594
Where did they
come from?
I don’t know.

23:55.685 --> 23:57.801
Maybe a pipe.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.227
That was helpful.

24:00.315 --> 24:04.354
l discern from your tone
that you mean the opposite
of what you’re saying.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.856
Which is the very
definition of irony.

24:11.701 --> 24:15.569
This is the construction site
before the concrete was poured.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.403
And this is rebar.

24:17.498 --> 24:20.114
Now over that is a layer
of plastic sheeting.

24:20.209 --> 24:25.044
It appears that the victim was pushed
or fell from this spot.

24:25.131 --> 24:28.464
How high is that?
Just shy of three meters.

24:28.551 --> 24:31.384
And he was impaled here.

24:32.722 --> 24:36.510
[ Saroyan ]
But his skull
was found over there.

24:36.601 --> 24:40.014
Yeah, the body
was yanked off the rebar
and dragged over there.

24:40.104 --> 24:43.346
The plastic sheeting was sliced,
and the body was shoved underneath.

24:43.483 --> 24:47.726
So the corpse decomposed under
the plastic for four months
before the concrete was poured?

24:47.862 --> 24:52.356
The construction company went bust,
and the whole area was fenced off
for several months.

24:52.492 --> 24:56.952
And then another company came in
and bought the project
and poured the foundation.

24:57.038 --> 25:00.656
Now the concrete
lifted the skull through
the slit in the plastic,

25:00.750 --> 25:04.459
and the rest of the bones
dissolved from Hodgins’s fungus.

25:04.545 --> 25:08.834
This guy was impaled.
So how did nobody notice
the blood for four months?

25:08.925 --> 25:12.759
Black plastic and rusty rebar
from a distance—
practically impossible.

25:12.845 --> 25:16.463
Can all of the nicks
on the bones be explained
by the rebar?

25:16.557 --> 25:18.422
Yeah, let me show you.

25:23.773 --> 25:25.354
Okay, what’s that?

25:25.441 --> 25:27.477
That’s a nick on his spine.

25:27.568 --> 25:31.106
Okay, the wound on the right
transverse process of the T6...

25:31.197 --> 25:34.064
does not line up with the rest
of the wounds from the rebar.

25:34.158 --> 25:37.275
Well, it could have been inflicted
before he fell on the rebar.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.993
That one there.
It punctures his lung.

25:43.084 --> 25:45.040
This is not only cause of death,

25:45.128 --> 25:48.791
it’s the way Hodgins’s fungus
was introduced into the bone marrow.

25:56.097 --> 25:57.928
[ Booth ]
So, you remember
these entertainers...

25:58.057 --> 26:00.434
fight over
the best spots, right?
Yes.

26:00.518 --> 26:03.601
Okay, so who had
the most to gain from
Robert Pearson leaving?

26:03.688 --> 26:05.804
The other dancer,
Russell Leonard.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.560
Yeah, so with Robert gone,
Russell’s the only dancer.

26:08.693 --> 26:10.900
Robert’s death
doubled his income.
Is that all you got?

26:10.987 --> 26:15.777
Because if we’re looking for
a pickpocket, that magician
makes a good suspect.

26:15.867 --> 26:18.904
Uh,uh,uh.
Magician’s record’s
totally clean.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.906
Russell was arrested
two months ago...

26:20.997 --> 26:23.363
for threatening another dancer
with a sharpened screwdriver.

26:23.458 --> 26:26.575
The murder weapon,
as described by Cam and Angela,

26:26.669 --> 26:28.910
could very well be
a sharpened screwdriver...

26:29.005 --> 26:30.495
tipped with a bone-eating fungus.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.876
Bone-eating fungus, huh?

26:33.009 --> 26:38.129
Hmm. Sometimes you say things
that sound crazy in a really
totally serious tone of voice.

26:38.222 --> 26:39.337
Perhaps.

Yeah. Right. Great.

27:29.899 --> 27:32.481
Whoo!
All right, all right.
Thank you. Thank you.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.105
All right. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

27:35.196 --> 27:38.279
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

27:38.366 --> 27:40.152
All right, yeah. That’s what
I’m talkin’ about right—

27:43.079 --> 27:46.071
All that and you can’t
even kick in a buck.
Now what’s up with that?

27:48.125 --> 27:50.741
Oh, now you’re
kickin’ my stuff.
That’s police brutality.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.702
Oh, I’m not kickin’.
I’m just stumblin’.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.046
You wanna know what, Bones?
What?

27:55.132 --> 27:56.838
You know what I feel
with my foot there?

27:56.926 --> 28:02.262
Looks like a... weapon.
Uh-oh. Parole violation, pal.

28:03.516 --> 28:06.508
Your fluidity makes it appear
that you have no bones.

28:06.602 --> 28:10.345
- And I am an expert on bones.
So I find that very impressive.
- [Cell Phone Rings]

28:10.439 --> 28:12.179
Well, thank you.
I’ll take that as
a great compliment...

28:12.316 --> 28:15.808
while being intimidated
by law enforcement.
Booth.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.648
Yeah, uh, h-hold on.
Hey, guys, over here.
Uh, I’m on my way.

28:21.742 --> 28:24.950
- Booth, what’s wrong?
- l-l gotta go.
Hannah’s been shot.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.712
Don’t worry, Seeley.
I’m fine.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.627
You got shot, Hannah.
You’re not fine.

28:35.715 --> 28:38.627
I’ve been shot before.
So have you, right?

28:38.759 --> 28:42.251
It’s not like you build up
an immunity to gunshot wounds.
You should have taken me with you.

28:42.346 --> 28:43.882
Stop.

28:43.973 --> 28:47.761
If I’m there with an FBI. guy,
I don’t get my story.
You know that.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.805
Did you see the shooter?
Why?

28:49.937 --> 28:53.395
You gonna go after him?
Yeah, I am.

28:53.482 --> 28:56.098
They pulled a .38 slug
out of my leg.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.975
A cop gun.
When I was shot,

28:58.070 --> 28:59.935
I was talkin’ to a dealer...

29:00.031 --> 29:02.773
who was telling me
about cops moving drugs
in his neighborhood.

29:02.867 --> 29:04.607
In my experience,

29:04.702 --> 29:06.658
things are not that coincidental.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.659
So you’re not gonna
lose yourjob here, are you?

29:10.750 --> 29:12.456
I mean, your editor’s
not gonna can you?

29:12.543 --> 29:14.784
No. I’m shot.
I’m pretty.

29:14.879 --> 29:17.370
Suddenly, he thinks
it’s a pretty good story.

29:18.966 --> 29:21.708
I looked at your X-rays.

29:21.802 --> 29:25.169
Yeah, well, the doctor said
it was nothing. I should be
out in the morning.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.505
- That’s a very bad idea.
- Why?

29:27.600 --> 29:31.684
Because Hannah has suffered
a hairline avulsion fracture
of the femur.

29:31.771 --> 29:34.103
The doctor said it was
a little nick on the bone.

29:34.190 --> 29:38.650
An avulsion fracture is caused
when a tendon or ligament
pulls off a piece of bone.

29:38.736 --> 29:40.727
If you stressed your leg incorrectly,

29:40.821 --> 29:44.439
the tendon could pull
that shard of bone out
farther than it already is...

29:44.533 --> 29:46.273
and sever the femoral artery.

29:46.369 --> 29:49.611
You’d bleed out and die before
anyone knew what had happened.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.866
You sure?

29:53.417 --> 29:56.159
I’ll talk to the chief
surgical resident.

29:56.253 --> 29:58.710
I believe he’ll want to operate
on you this evening.

30:01.175 --> 30:04.383
So, basically,

30:04.470 --> 30:07.177
you saved my life.

30:13.062 --> 30:14.177
Bones.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.061
Thanks.

30:38.045 --> 30:40.036
Any evidence
on the screwdriver?

30:40.131 --> 30:42.964
Well, I pulled all of this,
so I know he used
the screwdriver...

30:43.050 --> 30:47.043
to open beer, scrape dog
excrement off the bottom
of a shoe, stir coffee.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.135
Hopefully, not in that order.
It’s been six months.

30:49.223 --> 30:53.717
There’s not much chance that
the fungus would still be evident
on a smooth metal surface.

30:53.853 --> 30:56.344
So what now?
Now it’s time
to go to the source.

30:56.439 --> 30:58.395
The C.D.C. reported
three more cases...

30:58.482 --> 31:01.974
of Blastomyces dermat/t/dis
linked to Kalorama Park.

31:02.069 --> 31:03.400
Which would tie the dancer
to the murder.

31:03.529 --> 31:06.646
Ah, beats cultural
anthropology, don’t it?
[ Chuckles ]

31:11.579 --> 31:14.662
Oh, Agent Booth.
No, you should
be with Hannah.

31:14.749 --> 31:16.580
Dr. Brennan and I can
conduct the interrogation.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.248
Bones said the operation
was routine.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.584
It’s a simple procedure, yes.
And we have a case to work.

31:20.671 --> 31:24.163
Okay. Uh, you’re obviously upset,
and that’s understandable.

31:24.258 --> 31:26.624
I’m not upset, okay?
I am just doing my job.

31:26.719 --> 31:30.587
Something is happening here,
and I’m not sure what it is.

31:30.681 --> 31:34.014
Well, Agent Booth had a scare.
Someone very close to him
could have died.

31:34.101 --> 31:35.887
And now he’s
obviously in denial.

31:35.978 --> 31:39.516
I’m close with Booth and am
frequently in life-threatening situations.

31:39.648 --> 31:43.106
But we persevere.
See that, Sweets?
Not in denial. I’m persevering.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.941
Yep.
Persevering.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.528
That’s right.
All right.

31:47.740 --> 31:50.106
[ Booth ]
You got two assault
charges here, okay?

31:50.201 --> 31:52.032
One where you threatened someone
with a screwdriver.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.360
That was self-defense.
The charges were dropped.

31:54.497 --> 31:57.614
The petty theft charge
wasn’t dropped.
I stole a sandwich.

31:57.708 --> 32:00.370
l was hungry.
I spent five days locked up.

32:00.461 --> 32:03.248
I’m sure they can think
of better ways to spend
the taxpayers’ money.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.250
Why don’t you
tell us about you
and your friend Robert.

32:05.341 --> 32:07.081
Look, when Robert came
to the park, he was broke.

32:07.218 --> 32:10.756
I showed him the ropes,
told him what kind of moves
would bring him the biggest crowds.

32:10.888 --> 32:14.756
- Then in a couple weeks, he was
making more money than you.
- That must have pissed you off.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.136
No. I mean, lwas—
! was jealous, okay.

32:17.228 --> 32:19.435
But Robert and me,
we were friends.

32:19.522 --> 32:21.934
Your screwdriver is a good match
for the murder weapon.

32:22.024 --> 32:24.015
If you’re such great friends,
why didn’t you report him missing?

32:24.110 --> 32:27.819
I work the streets.
People come and go.
That’s the way it is.

32:27.905 --> 32:31.238
People in streets, they also
don’t like it when someone takes
money they think is theirs.

32:31.325 --> 32:35.489
Okay, I get where this is goin’.
So you’ve already decided
that I’m guilty.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.194
I want a lawyer.

32:48.217 --> 32:52.130
These wrappers are from
the vendor who sells chicken.
They’re clean.

32:52.221 --> 32:55.179
So far, none of the food stalls show
any kind of evidence of fungus.

32:58.561 --> 33:01.519
Well, look at the bright side.
Now we can eat this pad thai.

33:01.605 --> 33:02.936
- Does look delicious.
- [ Chuckles ]

33:03.023 --> 33:06.641
Hey, there’s definitely some
kind of eukaryotic organism...

33:06.735 --> 33:08.236
growing on this.

33:08.320 --> 33:12.279
These trash bags,
they all come from
the restroom, huh?

33:12.366 --> 33:14.357
This is not how I imagined
spending my day.

33:14.451 --> 33:18.820
Do me a favor? Separate all
the trash bags from the restroom
from the others.

33:18.914 --> 33:21.246
Working on two degrees,
and this is where I end up.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.494
Tuition money well spent.

33:23.586 --> 33:27.625
Hey, hey, hey.
Blastomyces dermat/t/dis.

33:27.715 --> 33:31.299
All right. The park janitor
collected what we needed.

33:32.386 --> 33:34.251
[Arastoo ]
Look what else he has.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.137
We just found
the murder weapon.

33:57.119 --> 33:59.155
It’s possible that this
was the murder weapon.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.487
- Okay.
- Would you be happier if I said...

34:01.582 --> 34:05.074
it was probable
it was the murder weapon
instead of possible?

34:05.211 --> 34:08.999
Sometimes decreasing
the probabilities makes it tougher
to identify the murderer.

34:09.089 --> 34:12.877
You mean, we know
what, when and how,

34:12.968 --> 34:17.462
but we have no evidence tying
this weapon to a specific who.

34:17.556 --> 34:21.765
Really, it could be anybody.
But it’s good that
we found the weapon.

34:21.852 --> 34:26.471
Wait, it seems the murderer
chased the victim through the park.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.681
Booth would wanna know why.

34:28.776 --> 34:31.062
Shakespeare said the victim
was a pickpocket.

34:31.153 --> 34:33.735
Maybe one of his angry marks
caught him at it.

34:33.822 --> 34:37.986
Okay. So, the angry mark
grabs the trash picker...

34:38.077 --> 34:41.069
and catches up to the victim
at the construction site.

34:41.163 --> 34:44.121
Stabs him in the back,
tosses him
into the foundation.

34:44.208 --> 34:48.918
Then slits the plastic
and shoves his body beneath it.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.835
I know what you’re thinking.

34:50.923 --> 34:53.630
We already looked
for the fingerprints on
the plastic where it was cut.

34:53.717 --> 34:56.550
It’s all degraded
and smeared from the blood.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.343
The forensic team
found nothing usable.

34:58.430 --> 35:02.969
No, no. Cam, along the slit
was the wrong place to look.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.470
What is she doing?

35:07.564 --> 35:09.896
Dr. Hodgins, would you come
over here and be a corpse?

35:09.984 --> 35:11.849
[Chuckles]

35:12.945 --> 35:14.185
Yeah.

35:15.906 --> 35:18.989
[Angela ]
Sweetie, y—you do mean
“pretend” to be a corpse, right?

35:19.076 --> 35:22.489
’Cause the way you’re holding
that knife, you’re looking
a little “slashery.”

35:22.579 --> 35:24.991
No, this knife
is not for Dr. Hodgins.

35:25.082 --> 35:27.448
Now, the curve in the slit suggests...

35:27.543 --> 35:30.455
that the murderer held
the knife in his right hand.

35:30.546 --> 35:35.506
And the slash extended
1.5 meters, performed
in one smooth movement.

35:35.592 --> 35:38.083
Just careful where you’re goin’
with that razor-sharp blade there.

35:39.179 --> 35:41.591
- Whoa!
- [ Thud]

35:41.682 --> 35:43.513
There.

35:45.394 --> 35:46.634
There.
[ Saroyan ]
Uh, there?

35:46.770 --> 35:48.761
What there?
Right.

35:48.856 --> 35:50.767
She supported her weight
with her left hand.

35:50.858 --> 35:54.021
So she left a full palm print
on the plastic.

35:54.111 --> 35:56.193
How do you get
a six-month-old palm print...

35:56.280 --> 35:58.896
off a piece of plastic
that’s encased in concrete?

36:00.409 --> 36:01.899
I need some gold.

36:06.582 --> 36:08.072
[Hannah]
Did you catch the murderer?

36:08.167 --> 36:12.001
Well, technically,
attempted murderer,
since you survived.

36:12.087 --> 36:16.330
I meant the dancer-killer,
not the journalist-shooter.

36:16.425 --> 36:18.962
We’ll catch him.
Don’t worry.

36:19.053 --> 36:21.260
Then we’ll catch
whoever did this to you.

36:23.015 --> 36:24.971
Ten bucks says
I catch him before you do.

36:25.059 --> 36:28.551
Ha! I’m not a betting man.
But if I was, I’d definitely
raise the stakes.

36:28.645 --> 36:32.558
Obviously, whoever shot me is a cop
who’s afraid of getting caught.

36:33.609 --> 36:35.224
I think you should back off.

36:36.904 --> 36:38.440
You gotta be kidding?
What?

36:38.530 --> 36:40.521
No. At least until
you get your health back.

36:40.616 --> 36:45.110
Then we can lull him
into a false sense of security.

36:46.663 --> 36:49.120
We catch him together.

36:51.627 --> 36:53.288
Could you please lean in?

36:53.379 --> 36:54.835
Closer.

36:54.922 --> 36:56.458
A little closer.

36:57.758 --> 36:59.464
Within lip reach.

37:05.307 --> 37:08.845
Thank you for being
my big scary protector.

37:08.936 --> 37:10.426
[ Growls ]

37:17.027 --> 37:20.690
Now, the process is called
vacuum metal deposition.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.646
Well, this looks like
a popcorn machine.

37:22.741 --> 37:27.326
Now gold will bind with
the lipids from fingerprints
at an atomic level.

37:27.413 --> 37:31.031
Now this technique involves
coating a thin layer...

37:31.125 --> 37:36.586
- of thermalized metallic dust
onto the evidence.
- It has to be gold?

37:36.713 --> 37:41.707
Well, yeah.
Gold conducts electricity better
than any other noncorrosive metal.

37:41.802 --> 37:43.713
What, did you have to pay
for it yourself?

37:43.804 --> 37:46.716
Just go. Do.

37:46.807 --> 37:49.514
Okay, here goes the gold.

37:52.271 --> 37:57.186
Now evaporated zinc
will only condense onto metal.

37:59.528 --> 38:02.691
Since the gold has bonded
with the fingerprints,

38:02.781 --> 38:07.775
there’s more metal in the print
than the rest of the sample.

38:07.870 --> 38:09.531
Voila.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.452
It worked.
Thank goodness.

38:18.547 --> 38:21.254
- Oh.
- What?

38:21.341 --> 38:24.799
[Angela ]
That is not the maintenance guy
from the park’s handprint.

38:24.887 --> 38:27.924
- How do you know?
- [ Saroyan ]
It’s too small. It’s a child.

38:28.015 --> 38:30.006
Or a woman.

38:42.446 --> 38:44.653
What if the other one
doesn’t drink anything?

38:44.740 --> 38:47.732
We turn the air-conditioning
up in the room, suck all
the moisture out of it.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.782
So which one
do you think it is?

38:49.870 --> 38:51.656
I have no idea.

38:51.747 --> 38:54.033
Think of it as a game, all right?
Take a guess.

38:54.166 --> 38:57.875
Just between the two of us.
No one’s gonna hear you.
Go ahead. Guess, guess, guess.

38:57.961 --> 39:01.829
Well, the ballet teacher
seems very mean and vindictive.

39:01.924 --> 39:03.710
Plus, she’s deceptively strong.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.791
And she’s not afraid
to be violent.

39:05.928 --> 39:08.340
Mmm. Sorry. Wrong.
How do you know?

39:08.430 --> 39:10.716
I went through
all the police reports of
the pickpocket incidents...

39:10.807 --> 39:12.217
that happened
out at Kalorama Park.

39:12.309 --> 39:13.799
What did that tell you?

39:13.894 --> 39:15.509
That not one incident
out of dozens...

39:15.604 --> 39:20.473
ever occurred while Beverly Houle
or Robert Pearson were performing.

39:20.567 --> 39:24.810
So they were the team
that Sweets heard about
from the Shakespeare statue.

39:24.947 --> 39:28.815
He cheated her.
She chased him
with the garbage picker,

39:28.951 --> 39:31.818
stuck him in the back—
end of story.
Yeah.

39:31.912 --> 39:35.245
But when a woman kills a man,
it’s neverjust about the money.

39:35.332 --> 39:39.041
You’re implying there was some
kind of sexual tension involved.

39:39.127 --> 39:42.494
Right. When that goes south,
all bets are off.

39:42.589 --> 39:45.046
There’s no honor amongst
thieves or ex-lovers.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.794
Yeah.

39:52.599 --> 39:54.840
That’s it. Show time.

39:57.938 --> 39:59.098
[ Booth ]
Hmm?

40:14.329 --> 40:15.614
Busted.

40:15.706 --> 40:18.539
Her body language
doesn’t prove anything.

40:18.625 --> 40:20.741
Well, we have different
definitions for that.
That’s for sure.

40:20.836 --> 40:23.828
That’s why nobody can thwart
our criminological brilliance.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.664
Did you read that off
of a restaurant place mat?

40:26.758 --> 40:29.670
Comic book. I’m on
a self-improvement kick,
all right?

41:09.635 --> 41:11.000
[ Knocking ]

41:11.094 --> 41:12.550
Temperance.

41:12.638 --> 41:14.629
Come on in.

41:14.723 --> 41:16.429
How do you feel?

41:16.516 --> 41:18.643
I’m alive.

41:18.727 --> 41:20.433
Thanks to you.

41:22.189 --> 41:24.805
Hey, where’s my gift?

41:24.900 --> 41:26.140
Excuse me?

41:26.234 --> 41:27.815
Listen, | get it.

41:27.903 --> 41:29.814
You saved my life,
and I’m very grateful.

41:29.946 --> 41:34.315
But traditionally,
when you come to visit someone
in the hospital, you bear gifts.

41:34.409 --> 41:38.618
Well, that custom began
as a replacement
for religious sacrifice.

41:38.705 --> 41:42.118
As a way to get the gods to
take mercy on a sick person.

41:42.209 --> 41:44.746
Yes. But I don’t
believe in that.

41:44.878 --> 41:47.210
So—
But you do believe
in cultural traditions?

41:47.297 --> 41:49.003
Of course. But—

41:49.091 --> 41:54.051
So, since I’m not above
a little supplication
every once in a while,

41:54.137 --> 41:57.675
maybe you should give me
your sunglasses?

41:57.808 --> 42:00.390
[ Chuckles ]
Seriously?
Sure.

42:01.436 --> 42:02.721
Okay.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.596
There you go.
Thank you.

42:08.527 --> 42:13.612
Perhaps you should be more
careful in what stories
you pursue in the future.

42:16.827 --> 42:17.987
Why?

42:18.078 --> 42:21.445
Booth would be very unhappy
if you died.

42:23.500 --> 42:28.620
Would you back down, Temperance,
if you thought you were working
on something important?

42:28.714 --> 42:31.547
No.
[Chuckles]

42:31.633 --> 42:34.420
No, I wouldn’t.
[Chuckles]

42:35.470 --> 42:38.837
Well, aren’t we a pair?

42:38.932 --> 42:40.923
[Chuckles]

42:41.017 --> 42:46.557
I guess Seeley’s gonna have to
resign himself to being worried
as long as we’re both around.

42:46.648 --> 42:48.559
We are.
We are quite a pair.

42:48.650 --> 42:51.141
[Both Laughing]
They look good on you.

43:24.936 --> 43:26.346
What’s that mean?
