<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:02.250 --> 00:06.667
<i>Stardate 43714.1.</i>

00:06.709 --> 00:08.625
<i>We have finally succeeded</i>

00:06.709 --> 00:08.625
<i>in eradicating</i>

00:08.667 --> 00:11.458

00:08.667 --> 00:11.458

00:45.959 --> 00:47.667
(<i> beeping</i> )

00:47.709 --> 00:50.792
Commander, ship's sensors detect

00:47.709 --> 00:50.792
an abnormal energy reading

00:50.834 --> 00:52.333
in the Captain's quarters.

00:52.375 --> 00:53.333
Type?

00:53.375 --> 00:54.750
Undetermined.

00:54.792 --> 00:57.083
Riker to Captain Picard.

00:58.875 --> 01:01.917
Security team

00:58.875 --> 01:01.917
to Captain's quarters.

01:31.250 --> 01:34.250

01:34.291 --> 01:36.542
Picard to<i> Enterprise.</i>

01:38.625 --> 01:40.041

01:40.083 --> 01:42.291
Anyone receiving

01:40.083 --> 01:42.291

please respond.

(<i> beeping</i> )

01:56.250 --> 01:58.333
Security override.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.333
Priority one.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.917
Is something the matter,

02:01.500 --> 02:03.917
Lieutenant?

02:33.333 --> 02:37.750
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

02:37.792 --> 02:41.917
<i>These are the voyages</i>

02:37.792 --> 02:41.917
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

02:41.959 --> 02:43.792
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

02:43.834 --> 02:47.750
<i>to explore</i>

02:43.834 --> 02:47.750
<i>strange new worlds</i>

02:47.792 --> 02:52.125

04:18.291 --> 04:19.625
(<i> gasping</i> )

04:19.667 --> 04:20.709
It's all right,

04:19.667 --> 04:20.709
it's all right.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.625
I'm not going to hurt you.

04:22.667 --> 04:23.917
Ca... Captain...?

04:23.959 --> 04:26.125
Picard of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

04:26.166 --> 04:27.417
Captain Picard.

04:27.458 --> 04:30.500
We studied your missions

04:27.458 --> 04:30.500
at the academy.

04:30.542 --> 04:33.917
Mitena Haro, first year cadet,

04:30.542 --> 04:33.917
Starfleet Academy.

04:33.959 --> 04:35.041
Cadet Haro.

04:35.083 --> 04:37.000
Perhaps<i> you</i>

04:35.083 --> 04:37.000
can explain

04:37.041 --> 04:38.625
what this is all about.

04:38.667 --> 04:40.750
Unfortunately, I can't,

04:38.667 --> 04:40.750
Mister...?

04:40.792 --> 04:41.750
Tholl.

04:41.792 --> 04:44.125
Kova Tholl, of Mizar II.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.542
Well, Mr. Tholl, all I know is

04:45.583 --> 04:48.250
that I've been brought here

04:45.583 --> 04:48.250
against my will.

04:48.291 --> 04:50.250
Wherever "here" is.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.000
The same thing

04:50.291 --> 04:52.000
happened to me, sir.

04:52.041 --> 04:56.875
I-I was alone, studying,

04:52.041 --> 04:56.875
and... I fainted.

04:56.917 --> 04:59.750
When I came to...

04:59.792 --> 05:02.792
It was about three days ago.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.583
And you, sir?

05:04.625 --> 05:06.375
I've been here

05:04.625 --> 05:06.375
12 days

05:06.417 --> 05:08.458
possibly more.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.959
I had been meditating privately

05:10.000 --> 05:12.542
and for no reason whatever,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.542
I lost consciousness.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.709
What can you tell me

05:12.583 --> 05:14.709
about our captors?

05:14.750 --> 05:17.667
Nothing.

05:14.750 --> 05:17.667
They've never shown themselves.

05:22.792 --> 05:25.166
Four sleeping areas.

05:25.208 --> 05:29.166
That implies we may be joined

05:25.208 --> 05:29.166
by another captive.

05:36.125 --> 05:39.583
It's edible

05:39.625 --> 05:42.500
but I wouldn't

05:39.625 --> 05:42.500
call it food.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.250
Hmm...

06:06.500 --> 06:07.834
I wouldn't

06:06.500 --> 06:07.834
touch that.

06:07.875 --> 06:08.792
Why not?

06:08.834 --> 06:10.625
If it's the door lock

06:10.667 --> 06:15.083
the combination is too complex

06:10.667 --> 06:15.083
to hit at random.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.375
I tried it... and was punished.

06:18.417 --> 06:21.709
Punished?

06:21.750 --> 06:23.083
How?

06:23.125 --> 06:24.417
Severe pain.

06:24.458 --> 06:27.083
Some sort of energy beam.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.542
I won't go near

06:27.125 --> 06:29.542
that panel again.

06:35.542 --> 06:37.750
(<i> communications beep</i> )

06:37.792 --> 06:41.417
WORF:

06:37.792 --> 06:41.417
Sir, the<i> Hood</i> has arrived

06:37.792 --> 06:41.417
at the rendezvous point.

06:41.458 --> 06:45.458
They are expecting us

06:41.458 --> 06:45.458
in 36 hours.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.750
Thank you, Lieutenant.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.542
Mr. Data

06:51.583 --> 06:54.583
the nearest pulsar

06:51.583 --> 06:54.583
is in the Lonka Cluster

06:54.625 --> 06:55.625
is it not?

06:55.667 --> 06:56.792
Correct, sir.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.959
What do we know

06:56.834 --> 06:58.959
about that pulsar?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.417
A great deal, sir.

07:00.458 --> 07:01.959
It is a rotating neutron star

07:02.000 --> 07:04.917
of approximately

07:02.000 --> 07:04.917
4.356 solar masses...

07:04.959 --> 07:08.000
Mr. Crusher, how long would it

07:04.959 --> 07:08.000
take us to get there?

07:08.041 --> 07:12.166
At warp seven,

07:08.041 --> 07:12.166
34 minutes, sir.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.667
Mr. Crusher,

07:12.208 --> 07:14.667
make it so.

07:14.709 --> 07:17.250
Sir?

07:17.291 --> 07:19.583
Set course for

07:17.291 --> 07:19.583
the Lonka Cluster.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.625
Warp two.

07:21.667 --> 07:24.250
Aye, sir.

07:24.291 --> 07:26.458
Sir, at warp two

07:26.500 --> 07:28.542
we'll arrive at the pulsar

07:26.500 --> 07:28.542
in 31 hours.

07:28.583 --> 07:29.750
Thank you, Ensign.

07:29.792 --> 07:30.917
Engage.

07:30.959 --> 07:32.583
WESLEY:

07:30.959 --> 07:32.583
Aye, sir.

07:32.625 --> 07:34.500
Will we be delaying

07:32.625 --> 07:34.500
our rendezvous with

07:32.625 --> 07:34.500
the<i> Hood,</i> sir?

07:34.542 --> 07:36.333
We may have to,

07:34.542 --> 07:36.333
Number One.

07:36.375 --> 07:39.500
Lieutenant, contact

07:36.375 --> 07:39.500
the<i> Hood</i> and inform

07:36.375 --> 07:39.500
them of our delay.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.583
Aye, Commander.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.125
Belay that order.

07:42.166 --> 07:44.333
There will be no

07:42.166 --> 07:44.333
further communication

07:44.375 --> 07:47.333
off this ship

07:44.375 --> 07:47.333
without my prior

07:44.375 --> 07:47.333
authorization.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.792
Commander, may I

07:49.250 --> 07:51.792
have

07:49.250 --> 07:51.792
a word with you?

07:51.834 --> 07:53.625
Mr. Data, you

07:51.834 --> 07:53.625
have the Bridge.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.291
Aye, sir.

08:04.125 --> 08:07.041
Number One, you know

08:04.125 --> 08:07.041
I like to keep you

08:04.125 --> 08:07.041
well informed

08:07.083 --> 08:08.166
as to the nature

08:07.083 --> 08:08.166
of our missions.

08:08.208 --> 08:09.458
Yes, sir.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.625
And if I don't inform you,

08:09.500 --> 08:11.625
there is a reason.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.417
Well, I don't like

08:11.667 --> 08:13.417
keeping you in the dark

08:13.458 --> 08:14.875
but for the next few days

08:14.917 --> 08:17.834
I may not be able to be

08:14.917 --> 08:17.834
as communicative as usual.

08:17.875 --> 08:19.750
It may make things

08:17.875 --> 08:19.750
difficult for you.

08:19.792 --> 08:20.917
Don't worry

08:19.792 --> 08:20.917
about me, sir.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.667
I can handle it.

08:22.709 --> 08:24.750
And the crew?

08:24.792 --> 08:26.917
You can count on

08:24.792 --> 08:26.917
all of us, sir.

08:26.959 --> 08:29.959
I appreciate that,

08:26.959 --> 08:29.959
Number One.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.750
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

08:32.792 --> 08:35.542
(<i> rhythmic beeping</i> )

08:44.959 --> 08:46.625
Picard

08:46.667 --> 08:49.458
what are you doing?

08:49.500 --> 08:51.750
I'm attempting

08:49.500 --> 08:51.750
to let our captors know

08:51.792 --> 08:52.959
we possess intelligence.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.875
You don't think

08:53.000 --> 08:54.875
they already know that?

08:54.917 --> 08:56.542
They can hear us talking.

08:56.583 --> 08:57.917
Yes, but they

08:56.583 --> 08:57.917
may not realize

08:57.959 --> 09:00.500
that we're communicating

08:57.959 --> 09:00.500
through language.

09:00.542 --> 09:02.250
Captain Picard is

09:00.542 --> 09:02.250
letting them know

09:02.291 --> 09:03.834
that we comprehend

09:02.291 --> 09:03.834
mathematics

09:03.875 --> 09:07.625
by tapping out

09:03.875 --> 09:07.625
the first six

09:03.875 --> 09:07.625
prime numbers.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.208
I know<i> what</i> he's doing.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.542
I'm trying to understand<i> why.</i>

09:11.583 --> 09:13.583
It is imperative

09:11.583 --> 09:13.583
that we communicate

09:13.625 --> 09:16.000
with our abductors;

09:13.625 --> 09:16.000
find out what they want.

09:16.041 --> 09:18.583
Obviously, they want us.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.125
Obviously.

09:22.458 --> 09:24.709
But why?

09:26.417 --> 09:31.667
What makes our captors

09:26.417 --> 09:31.667
choose us?

09:31.709 --> 09:33.458
What makes us special?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.208
I couldn't say, Captain.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.041
I'm certainly not special.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.917
I am just one cadet.

09:38.959 --> 09:40.500
What's your best

09:38.959 --> 09:40.500
area of study?

09:40.542 --> 09:42.625
Impulse propulsion systems.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.333
I'm very good

09:42.667 --> 09:44.333
with field coils.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.709
Good enough to

09:44.375 --> 09:46.709
be useful to

09:44.375 --> 09:46.709
our abductors?

09:49.250 --> 09:52.875
I don't know. Maybe.

09:52.917 --> 09:55.583
But if they needed

09:52.917 --> 09:55.583
an engineer, sir

09:55.625 --> 09:57.542
why didn't they

09:55.625 --> 09:57.542
take a real one?

09:57.583 --> 10:00.458
Why pick a

09:57.583 --> 10:00.458
Starfleet cadet?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.125
That I can't answer.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.125
(<i> sighs</i> )

10:05.542 --> 10:07.709
The Bolians

10:05.542 --> 10:07.709
are maintaining

10:07.750 --> 10:09.458
an uneasy truce

10:07.750 --> 10:09.458
with the Moropa

10:09.500 --> 10:10.500
are they not?

10:10.542 --> 10:11.917
That's right.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.750
But this does not look like

10:11.959 --> 10:14.750
Moropa technology

10:14.792 --> 10:19.000
and even assuming

10:14.792 --> 10:19.000
the Moropa wanted me

10:19.041 --> 10:22.500
what would they want

10:19.041 --> 10:22.500
with either of you?

10:22.542 --> 10:24.959
I've never even heard

10:22.542 --> 10:24.959
of the Moropa.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.417
My race has no enemies.

10:28.458 --> 10:29.959
None?

10:30.000 --> 10:34.208
In the last 300 years

10:30.000 --> 10:34.208
of Mizarian history

10:34.250 --> 10:36.875
your planet

10:34.250 --> 10:36.875
has been conquered six times.

10:36.917 --> 10:38.875
And we've survived

10:36.917 --> 10:38.875
by not resisting.

10:38.917 --> 10:43.792
Mizarians value peace

10:38.917 --> 10:43.792
above confrontation.

10:43.834 --> 10:45.500
And you have no idea

10:43.834 --> 10:45.500
who might have done this?

10:45.542 --> 10:47.667
No, I can't

10:45.542 --> 10:47.667
think of anyone

10:47.709 --> 10:49.333
who bears malice

10:47.709 --> 10:49.333
toward my race.

10:49.375 --> 10:51.500
Against you personally?

10:51.542 --> 10:53.083
You can't mean to

10:51.542 --> 10:53.083
suggest that someone

10:53.125 --> 10:54.667
with a personal

10:53.125 --> 10:54.667
grudge against me

10:54.709 --> 10:55.959
has gone to all

10:54.709 --> 10:55.959
this trouble?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.750
I'm not

10:56.000 --> 10:57.750
suggesting anything.

10:57.792 --> 10:59.333
I'm merely trying

10:57.792 --> 10:59.333
to come up

10:59.375 --> 11:01.083
with some explanation

10:59.375 --> 11:01.083
for your abduction.

11:01.125 --> 11:04.166
I am sorry, Picard.

11:01.125 --> 11:04.166
I can't give you one.

11:04.208 --> 11:06.542
I am neither important enough

11:04.208 --> 11:06.542
to hold for ransom

11:06.583 --> 11:08.417
nor radical enough

11:06.583 --> 11:08.417
to be dangerous.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.333
I'm a simple

11:08.458 --> 11:10.333
public servant.

11:10.375 --> 11:11.375
Nevertheless, Mr. Tholl...

11:11.417 --> 11:13.667
(<i> transporter hum</i> )

11:16.417 --> 11:18.834
(<i> groaning</i> )

11:25.667 --> 11:29.041
(<i> ferocious growling</i> )

11:29.083 --> 11:30.041
Stop!

11:30.083 --> 11:31.792
We mean you no harm.

11:31.834 --> 11:34.458
(<i> snarling growl</i> )

11:38.125 --> 11:39.333
We are prisoners, like yourself.

11:39.375 --> 11:40.750
We are<i> not</i> the enemy.

11:40.792 --> 11:43.333
Who has done this?

11:43.375 --> 11:44.709
We don't know.

11:44.750 --> 11:47.875
We were brought here

11:44.750 --> 11:47.875
the same way you were.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.542
Our captors refuse

11:47.917 --> 11:50.542
to show themselves.

11:52.709 --> 11:55.208
I don't trust you.

11:56.166 --> 11:59.667
You must trust us.

11:59.709 --> 12:03.166
We wish only to return

11:59.709 --> 12:03.166
to our worlds.

12:03.208 --> 12:05.834
Were you abducted from Chalna?

12:05.875 --> 12:09.291
You know my planet?

12:09.333 --> 12:11.000
Oh, yes.

12:11.041 --> 12:15.166
I visited there 12 years ago

12:11.041 --> 12:15.166
while commanding the<i> Stargazer.</i>

12:25.000 --> 12:26.333
RIKER:

12:25.000 --> 12:26.333
A five and 20.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.542
Ouch.

12:27.583 --> 12:31.000
If it's too rich,

12:27.583 --> 12:31.000
Geordi, fold.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.041
I'm thinking,

12:31.041 --> 12:32.041
I'm thinking.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.375
(<i> door chimes</i> )

12:33.417 --> 12:35.917
Enter.

12:35.959 --> 12:38.417
Counselor, gentlemen.

12:40.417 --> 12:41.834
Forgive this intrusion.

12:41.875 --> 12:44.333
I was, uh, just passing by.

12:44.375 --> 12:46.458
You are always

12:44.375 --> 12:46.458
welcome, Captain.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.458
I was wondering, Mr. La Forge

12:48.500 --> 12:52.083
what's our engine

12:48.500 --> 12:52.083
efficiency status?

12:52.125 --> 12:54.375
Operating at 93%, sir.

12:54.417 --> 12:57.125
Hmm. That's very good

12:57.166 --> 12:58.375
but I would like

12:58.417 --> 13:00.750
to increase the

12:58.417 --> 13:00.750
efficiency to 95%.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.667
No problem, Captain.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.667
I'll get right on it.

13:02.709 --> 13:04.083
Oh, that's not

13:02.709 --> 13:04.083
an order.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.583
Uh, you can get to it later.

13:06.625 --> 13:09.333
I don't want to disrupt

13:06.625 --> 13:09.333
your recreation.

13:09.375 --> 13:10.333
No, Captain.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.041
It's... it's no problem.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.583
Lady Luck left me long ago.

13:16.208 --> 13:17.834
Would you care

13:16.208 --> 13:17.834
to join us, Captain?

13:17.875 --> 13:19.125
We have an opening.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.792
Um... I'll just observe,

13:19.166 --> 13:22.792
if you don't mind.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.792
Not at all.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.792
Counselor, 20.

13:24.834 --> 13:30.208
(<i> chips rattling</i> )

13:30.250 --> 13:32.417
A pair of threes.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.667
Flush, queen high.

13:34.709 --> 13:37.125
That beats my fours.

13:37.166 --> 13:38.792
Well played,

13:37.166 --> 13:38.792
Counselor.

13:38.834 --> 13:40.417
Could I have a word

13:38.834 --> 13:40.417
for just a moment?

13:40.458 --> 13:41.834
Certainly, sir.

13:41.875 --> 13:43.375
Forgive me,

13:41.875 --> 13:43.375
gentlemen.

13:43.417 --> 13:46.208
I'll return your player

13:43.417 --> 13:46.208
to you in a moment.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.166
Counselor, I, uh...

13:52.333 --> 13:55.000
I wanted to ask you

13:52.333 --> 13:55.000
about the crew.

13:55.041 --> 13:58.333
How are they reacting

13:55.041 --> 13:58.333
to our sudden change in course?

13:58.375 --> 14:02.250
I sense

13:58.375 --> 14:02.250
no unusual reactions, Captain.

14:02.291 --> 14:04.417
After all,

14:02.291 --> 14:04.417
such a change is hardly

14:04.458 --> 14:05.792
out of the ordinary.

14:05.834 --> 14:08.792
They're not curious

14:05.834 --> 14:08.792
or concerned as to why?

14:08.834 --> 14:13.375
They're curious, yes,

14:08.834 --> 14:13.375
but concerned? No.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.709
They trust you.

14:16.083 --> 14:19.125
How far do you think

14:16.083 --> 14:19.125
that trust goes?

14:19.166 --> 14:21.959
Sir?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.166
Oh, I know, Counselor

14:24.208 --> 14:29.083
that the crew has always had

14:24.208 --> 14:29.083
full confidence in me, but...

14:31.375 --> 14:34.500
what if it were

14:31.375 --> 14:34.500
to change?

14:34.542 --> 14:37.875
Well, I'd inform you,

14:34.542 --> 14:37.875
sir, of course.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.583
Thank you, Counselor.

14:51.417 --> 14:54.709
My given name is Esoqq.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.959
It means "fighter."

14:57.041 --> 14:59.417
I'll bet half the names

14:57.041 --> 14:59.417
in the Chalna language

14:59.458 --> 15:01.208
mean "fighter."

15:01.250 --> 15:03.375
Mizarians--

15:03.417 --> 15:06.166
your names all

15:03.417 --> 15:06.166
mean "surrender."

15:06.208 --> 15:08.750
We are a peaceful race--

15:08.792 --> 15:10.417
a race of thinkers.

15:10.458 --> 15:13.834
A race of cowards.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.083
And you?

15:17.125 --> 15:19.709
I don't know

15:17.125 --> 15:19.709
your people.

15:19.750 --> 15:23.875
I am Mitena Haro

15:19.750 --> 15:23.875
of Bolarus IX.

15:23.917 --> 15:26.959
Who would want to imprison

15:23.917 --> 15:26.959
a child?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.792
I am not a child.

15:28.834 --> 15:31.709
Esoqq, I have been

15:28.834 --> 15:31.709
trying to determine

15:31.750 --> 15:34.875
if we have

15:31.750 --> 15:34.875
a common enemy--

15:34.917 --> 15:38.250
someone with a reason

15:34.917 --> 15:38.250
for confining us here.

15:38.291 --> 15:40.959
There are Chalnoth

15:38.291 --> 15:40.959
who would kill me if they could

15:41.000 --> 15:42.834
but kidnap?

15:42.875 --> 15:45.333
There is no reason.

15:45.375 --> 15:46.917
You have many enemies?

15:46.959 --> 15:48.542
None of consequence.

15:48.583 --> 15:52.667
I've slain all the ones

15:48.583 --> 15:52.667
who matter.

15:52.709 --> 15:54.625
That shocks you, Bolian?

15:54.667 --> 15:55.917
A little.

15:55.959 --> 15:58.041
And you?

15:58.083 --> 15:59.750
No, no, I'm

15:58.083 --> 15:59.750
not surprised.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.166
I've heard about your race.

16:01.208 --> 16:02.542
You're uncivilized.

16:02.583 --> 16:04.500
You have no laws,

16:02.583 --> 16:04.500
no system of government.

16:04.542 --> 16:08.750
The Chalnoth have no use

16:04.542 --> 16:08.750
for laws or governments.

16:08.792 --> 16:10.750
We are strong.

16:10.792 --> 16:12.792
We obey no one.

16:12.834 --> 16:17.250
You live in anarchy,

16:12.834 --> 16:17.250
murdering one another.

16:17.291 --> 16:20.125
That mentality

16:17.291 --> 16:20.125
may get us all killed.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.000
And<i> you</i> may be the first.

16:22.041 --> 16:23.834
Both of you--

16:22.041 --> 16:23.834
this is getting us nowhere.

16:23.875 --> 16:26.792
Neither is asking us

16:23.875 --> 16:26.792
useless questions, Picard.

16:26.834 --> 16:29.208
But if you must

16:26.834 --> 16:29.208
pursue the topic

16:29.250 --> 16:31.208
how long have you

16:29.250 --> 16:31.208
and the Romulans

16:31.250 --> 16:32.750
been adversaries?

16:32.792 --> 16:35.000
For quite a while, Mr. Tholl.

16:35.041 --> 16:39.333
Oh, I am perfectly willing

16:35.041 --> 16:39.333
to entertain the hypothesis

16:39.375 --> 16:40.834
that our captors are Romulans

16:40.875 --> 16:44.625
but what would the Romulans

16:40.875 --> 16:44.625
want with you?

16:44.667 --> 16:46.333
My brainpower, perhaps.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.166
It's well known

16:46.375 --> 16:48.166
that my species

16:48.208 --> 16:50.667
possesses superior

16:48.208 --> 16:50.667
intelligence and, uh...

16:50.709 --> 16:53.041
I am considered among

16:50.709 --> 16:53.041
the brightest of my people.

16:53.083 --> 16:55.709
HARO:

16:53.083 --> 16:55.709
And the least

16:53.083 --> 16:55.709
modest.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.458
(<i> sniffing</i> )

16:59.500 --> 17:00.792
What is this?

17:00.834 --> 17:03.709
PICARD:

17:00.834 --> 17:03.709
Food.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.834
The<i> only</i> food?

17:05.875 --> 17:07.208
It would seem so.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.375
Poison!

17:13.417 --> 17:14.583
Does this mean

17:14.625 --> 17:16.959
there is nothing here

17:14.625 --> 17:16.959
for you to eat?

17:25.667 --> 17:26.625
You.

17:26.667 --> 17:27.625
No, don't even think that.

17:27.667 --> 17:28.959
Picard, you won't let him...

17:29.000 --> 17:31.834
Esoqq, how long can you go

17:29.000 --> 17:31.834
without food?

17:32.917 --> 17:37.750
Three days,

17:32.917 --> 17:37.750
perhaps four.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.166
No longer?

17:39.208 --> 17:42.166
No longer.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.750
Well, all your tests

17:52.500 --> 17:55.750
indicate the same results.

17:55.792 --> 17:58.166
You are in great shape.

17:58.208 --> 17:59.750
I've never felt better.

17:59.792 --> 18:01.041
I see.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.333
Then why did you come in?

18:03.375 --> 18:06.375
Your annual physical

18:03.375 --> 18:06.375
isn't due for another month.

18:06.417 --> 18:09.709
Well, usually you

18:06.417 --> 18:09.709
have to remind me,

18:06.417 --> 18:09.709
and badger me

18:09.750 --> 18:11.250
and finally order

18:09.750 --> 18:11.250
me to report.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.750
For once, I thought I'd

18:11.291 --> 18:14.750
save you the trouble.

18:14.792 --> 18:19.375
Jean-Luc, be honest

18:14.792 --> 18:19.375
with your doctor.

18:19.417 --> 18:22.792
Are there any warning signs

18:19.417 --> 18:22.792
or symptoms

18:22.834 --> 18:24.583
that you haven't told me about?

18:26.333 --> 18:29.125
(<i> deep sigh</i> )

18:29.166 --> 18:33.166
As far as I know,

18:29.166 --> 18:33.166
I'm perfectly healthy.

18:34.792 --> 18:38.291
Well then, return to your post.

18:42.792 --> 18:44.792
Will you have dinner

18:42.792 --> 18:44.792
with me tonight?

18:44.834 --> 18:46.417
In Ten-Forward?

18:46.458 --> 18:48.166
What about my quarters?

18:48.208 --> 18:51.500
More intimate.

18:51.542 --> 18:55.250
Jean-Luc, you are

18:51.542 --> 18:55.250
full of surprises today.

18:55.291 --> 18:58.458
I take that

18:55.291 --> 18:58.458
to be a "yes."

19:09.166 --> 19:12.834
Picard, is it wise

19:09.166 --> 19:12.834
to attempt an escape?

19:12.875 --> 19:14.041
It's imperative.

19:14.083 --> 19:15.500
Why?

19:15.542 --> 19:17.917
Our captors haven't

19:15.542 --> 19:17.917
mistreated us.

19:17.959 --> 19:21.417
We've been<i> kidnapped,</i>

19:17.959 --> 19:21.417
locked in a room.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.458
You don't think

19:21.458 --> 19:23.458
that's mistreatment?

19:23.500 --> 19:26.291
They haven't hurt

19:23.500 --> 19:26.291
us, have they?

19:26.333 --> 19:28.500
I think we should

19:26.333 --> 19:28.500
just wait

19:28.542 --> 19:30.417
until we find out

19:28.542 --> 19:30.417
what they want.

19:30.458 --> 19:31.625
Be patient.

19:31.667 --> 19:33.667
We can no longer afford

19:31.667 --> 19:33.667
to be patient.

19:33.709 --> 19:36.583
Unless we act soon,

19:33.709 --> 19:36.583
Esoqq will starve.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.583
If we antagonize them

19:38.625 --> 19:41.333
they may decide we're more

19:38.625 --> 19:41.333
trouble than we're worth

19:41.375 --> 19:44.333
kill us and go

19:41.375 --> 19:44.333
capture another four.

19:44.375 --> 19:45.792
I agree,

19:44.375 --> 19:45.792
that's a risk

19:45.834 --> 19:47.250
but I see

19:45.834 --> 19:47.250
no alternative.

19:47.291 --> 19:50.875
Well... I refuse to help.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.291
As you wish, Mr. Tholl.

19:57.291 --> 20:00.917
We must get

19:57.291 --> 20:00.917
inside this panel.

20:00.959 --> 20:03.583
ESOQQ:

20:00.959 --> 20:03.583
Not very sturdy.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.875
Stand back, Haro.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.709
(<i> Esoqq growling</i> )

20:17.625 --> 20:20.542
The design is simple.

20:20.583 --> 20:23.041
Cross-circuiting

20:20.583 --> 20:23.041
the door mechanism

20:23.083 --> 20:24.709
should be easy.

20:24.750 --> 20:25.709
Make it so.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.041
Yes, sir.

20:36.166 --> 20:39.959
I think I've got it.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.458
(<i> door hums</i> )

20:45.291 --> 20:49.458
(<i> groaning</i> )

20:59.792 --> 21:01.875
I warned you.

21:26.750 --> 21:28.917
Out with it, Jean-Luc.

21:28.959 --> 21:31.375
Out with what?

21:31.417 --> 21:35.333
Whatever has been on your

21:31.417 --> 21:35.333
mind all evening long.

21:35.375 --> 21:38.041
Hmm. Has it been that apparent?

21:38.083 --> 21:39.875
Mm-hmm.

21:39.917 --> 21:41.583
How well you know me.

21:41.625 --> 21:45.417
After all this

21:41.625 --> 21:45.417
time, I ought to.

21:45.458 --> 21:46.875
Well, it's true.

21:46.917 --> 21:48.625
I have been preoccupied.

21:48.667 --> 21:52.166
I know that's not

21:48.667 --> 21:52.166
very flattering to you

21:52.208 --> 21:54.208
but I have been

21:52.208 --> 21:54.208
thinking about us

21:54.250 --> 21:58.500
and about the choices

21:54.250 --> 21:58.500
I've made.

21:58.542 --> 22:01.291
We both have

21:58.542 --> 22:01.291
made choices.

22:03.041 --> 22:09.083
And I've been wondering

22:03.041 --> 22:09.083
if they were the right ones.

22:09.125 --> 22:11.542
Sometimes, I feel

22:09.125 --> 22:11.542
we've allowed our positions

22:11.583 --> 22:12.959
to isolate us.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.875
Our positions

22:13.000 --> 22:16.875
necessitate a degree

22:16.917 --> 22:19.792
of professional

22:16.917 --> 22:19.792
detachment.

22:21.208 --> 22:25.125
But.... there's a danger

22:21.208 --> 22:25.125
in becoming too detached--

22:25.166 --> 22:28.750
of never permitting ourselves

22:25.166 --> 22:28.750
to get closer.

22:28.792 --> 22:33.291
Is that what you want, Jean-Luc?

22:33.333 --> 22:35.250
To get closer?

22:35.291 --> 22:39.458
You're a very attractive woman.

22:41.500 --> 22:46.417
And you're

22:41.500 --> 22:46.417
a very attractive man.

22:46.458 --> 22:49.875
But we both know

22:46.458 --> 22:49.875
it's not as simple as that.

22:53.709 --> 22:55.208
Would it be simpler

22:55.250 --> 22:57.750
if I were not

22:55.250 --> 22:57.750
your commanding officer?

22:58.875 --> 23:01.417
Simpler, perhaps.

23:03.959 --> 23:07.166
But that's not the only issue.

23:10.166 --> 23:13.792
I guess, right now

23:13.834 --> 23:15.709
I'm comfortable

23:13.834 --> 23:15.709
with our relationship

23:15.750 --> 23:18.125
just the way it is.

23:29.041 --> 23:32.166
(<i> soft, romantic music begins)</i>

23:35.250 --> 23:37.208
Would you care to dance?

23:37.250 --> 23:39.792
I thought you didn't dance.

23:39.834 --> 23:42.166
On special occasions.

23:52.208 --> 23:54.875
I don't think

23:52.208 --> 23:54.875
I told you

23:54.917 --> 23:57.792
but I'm glad you're back

23:54.917 --> 23:57.792
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

23:57.834 --> 24:00.792
I missed our friendship.

24:00.834 --> 24:03.041
I did, too.

24:43.166 --> 24:44.875
Jean-Luc...

24:44.917 --> 24:46.667
if I didn't

24:44.917 --> 24:46.667
know you better

24:46.709 --> 24:50.041
I would think you were

24:46.709 --> 24:50.041
playing games with me.

24:50.083 --> 24:53.542
Are you sorry

24:50.083 --> 24:53.542
you came tonight?

24:53.583 --> 24:55.625
I didn't say that.

24:55.667 --> 24:56.834
Good.

24:56.875 --> 25:00.125
Because I'm delighted

24:56.875 --> 25:00.125
that you did.

25:02.542 --> 25:07.375
But perhaps we should

25:02.542 --> 25:07.375
call it a night.

25:24.792 --> 25:26.875
Good night.

25:30.250 --> 25:33.417
I warned you

25:30.250 --> 25:33.417
not to provoke our captors.

25:33.458 --> 25:35.792
The next beams

25:33.458 --> 25:35.792
might be lethal.

25:35.834 --> 25:37.959
Not to you.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.083
You moved far from the door.

25:41.125 --> 25:42.458
Of course I did.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.417
Being stunned once was enough.

25:44.458 --> 25:46.917
You claimed you were hit

25:44.458 --> 25:46.917
by the stun beam

25:46.959 --> 25:49.917
before the rest of us arrived.

25:49.959 --> 25:52.125
You could be lying.

25:52.166 --> 25:55.458
Maybe our enemy

25:52.166 --> 25:55.458
is watching us

25:55.500 --> 25:57.458
from inside.

25:57.500 --> 26:00.208
Are you accusing me

25:57.500 --> 26:00.208
of collaborating

26:00.250 --> 26:01.625
with our abductors?

26:01.667 --> 26:05.792
Collaboration

26:01.667 --> 26:05.792
is what your species does best.

26:05.834 --> 26:07.458
You<i> did</i> try

26:07.500 --> 26:09.875
to talk us

26:07.500 --> 26:09.875
out of attempting to escape.

26:09.917 --> 26:12.083
For all we know

26:12.125 --> 26:15.208
<i>you</i> may be our captor.

26:15.250 --> 26:16.417
(<i> laughs</i> )

26:16.458 --> 26:18.583
Impossible.

26:16.458 --> 26:18.583
I'm a Mizarian.

26:18.625 --> 26:21.375
My people

26:18.625 --> 26:21.375
are not aggressive.

26:21.417 --> 26:25.166
How can we be sure

26:21.417 --> 26:25.166
you're a Mizarian?

26:25.208 --> 26:27.750
You could be an impostor.

26:27.792 --> 26:28.875
This is nonsense.

26:28.917 --> 26:30.500
What if<i> you're</i> an impostor?

26:30.542 --> 26:32.667
Esoqq was the last one

26:30.542 --> 26:32.667
to appear.

26:32.709 --> 26:35.041
And he<i> is</i> the only one

26:32.709 --> 26:35.041
with a weapon.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.250
Keep talking and I will use it.

26:37.291 --> 26:41.083
Tholl, our captors

26:37.291 --> 26:41.083
have transporters.

26:41.125 --> 26:42.500
They have stun beams.

26:42.542 --> 26:44.166
It is hardly likely

26:42.542 --> 26:44.166
that they would try

26:44.208 --> 26:45.959
to hold us at bay

26:44.208 --> 26:45.959
with a knife.

26:46.041 --> 26:48.333
Well then, maybe

26:46.041 --> 26:48.333
she's the impostor.

26:48.375 --> 26:51.375
She could have triggered

26:48.375 --> 26:51.375
the stun beams deliberately.

26:51.417 --> 26:52.917
I was hit, too.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.291
To forestall

26:52.959 --> 26:54.291
suspicion.

26:54.333 --> 26:56.375
You were very quick

26:54.333 --> 26:56.375
to volunteer.

26:56.417 --> 26:58.959
PICARD:

26:56.417 --> 26:58.959
Tholl,<i> I</i> asked her

26:56.417 --> 26:58.959
to open the door.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.041
You<i> ordered</i> her, you mean.

27:01.083 --> 27:03.417
You've been giving orders

27:01.083 --> 27:03.417
from the moment you got here--

27:03.458 --> 27:05.625
trying to make everyone

27:03.458 --> 27:05.625
do what you want.

27:05.667 --> 27:09.083
Tholl, what I want

27:05.667 --> 27:09.083
is for everyone to escape!

27:09.125 --> 27:11.709
Why should we

27:09.125 --> 27:11.709
believe you?

27:11.750 --> 27:15.291
Captain Picard's put his life

27:11.750 --> 27:15.291
at stake for others many times.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.375
The primitive culture

27:15.333 --> 27:17.375
on Mintaka III.

27:17.417 --> 27:18.750
The Wogneer creatures

27:18.792 --> 27:21.458
in the Ordek Nebula.

27:21.500 --> 27:24.625
And Cor Caroli V.

27:24.667 --> 27:25.834
Right.

27:25.875 --> 27:28.417
Helping to cure

27:25.875 --> 27:28.417
the Phyrox plague.

27:28.458 --> 27:29.625
And how do we know

27:29.667 --> 27:32.834
this<i> is</i> the heroic

27:29.667 --> 27:32.834
Captain Picard?

27:32.875 --> 27:35.667
We have no proof

27:32.875 --> 27:35.667
of his identity.

27:35.709 --> 27:37.750
THOLL:

27:35.709 --> 27:37.750
You've wasted our time

27:37.792 --> 27:38.917
with failed attempts

27:38.959 --> 27:40.375
to communicate with them

27:38.959 --> 27:40.375
or escape.

27:40.417 --> 27:42.458
Is that your task?

27:42.500 --> 27:44.125
To keep us busy

27:44.166 --> 27:45.875
so we're off guard?

27:48.125 --> 27:50.375
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>

27:50.417 --> 27:53.500
<i>Although we're still 18 hours</i>

27:50.417 --> 27:53.500
<i>from the Lonka Pulsar</i>

27:53.542 --> 27:57.625
<i>the Captain has ordered us</i>

27:53.542 --> 27:57.625
<i>to slow to one-half impulse.</i>

27:57.667 --> 28:00.959
<i>He has offered no explanation.</i>

28:01.000 --> 28:04.250
Here.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.750
I don't know why we're going

28:04.291 --> 28:06.750
to this pulsar.

28:06.792 --> 28:08.667
And creeping up on it

28:06.792 --> 28:08.667
at half-impulse

28:08.709 --> 28:10.083
makes even less sense.

28:10.125 --> 28:12.959
The Captain has given

28:10.125 --> 28:12.959
unusual orders before.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.208
I know

28:14.250 --> 28:16.583
but this is different--

28:14.250 --> 28:16.583
<i>he's</i> different.

28:16.625 --> 28:18.792
I can't put my finger on it

28:18.834 --> 28:20.959
but I'm worried.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.458
The Captain does seem...

28:23.500 --> 28:26.041
detached from his emotions.

28:26.083 --> 28:28.208
(<i> door opens</i> )

Well done.

28:44.875 --> 28:46.750
Thank you, sir.

When we arrive

28:46.792 --> 28:48.458
at the pulsar

28:48.500 --> 28:50.709
I shall require everyone

28:52.417 --> 28:53.583
Of course, Captain.

28:53.625 --> 28:54.625
Excellent.

the Captain says it's important

30:34.417 --> 30:36.125
and we trust him.

30:36.166 --> 30:38.625
Then, he runs the crew

30:36.166 --> 30:38.625
through efficiency drills

30:38.667 --> 30:40.667
for the first time

30:38.667 --> 30:40.667
in my tour of duty

30:40.709 --> 30:42.333
but he says we need them,

30:40.709 --> 30:42.333
so we need them--

30:42.375 --> 30:44.750
because we trust our Captain.

30:44.792 --> 30:46.709
But we also have a Captain

30:46.750 --> 30:49.417
singing drinking songs

30:46.750 --> 30:49.417
with his men.

30:49.458 --> 30:52.083
A captain who's come to the

30:49.458 --> 30:52.083
poker game for the first time.

30:52.125 --> 30:56.458
And he was very odd

30:52.125 --> 30:56.458
with me afterwards.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.542
He wanted me to warn him

30:58.583 --> 31:02.166
if the crew started

30:58.583 --> 31:02.166
to lose confidence in him.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.959
Any signs of mental stress

31:02.208 --> 31:04.959
or trauma?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.417
He came in

31:05.000 --> 31:07.417
for a physical

31:07.458 --> 31:08.709
with no word from me.

31:08.750 --> 31:10.917
Anything unusual, Doctor?

31:10.959 --> 31:12.041
Every test result

31:12.083 --> 31:14.000
identical

31:12.083 --> 31:14.000
to his last physical...

31:14.041 --> 31:17.083
which is kind of unusual

31:14.041 --> 31:17.083
in itself, actually.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.041
Almost as though

31:17.125 --> 31:19.041
he wanted to establish

31:19.083 --> 31:20.417
that there was nothing wrong.

31:20.458 --> 31:24.083
There was one other thing.

31:24.125 --> 31:27.166
He asked me to dinner

31:24.125 --> 31:27.166
in his cabin

31:27.208 --> 31:31.542
and it was

31:27.208 --> 31:31.542
a very unusual evening.

31:31.583 --> 31:33.166
(<i> sighs</i> )

31:33.208 --> 31:36.917
Which brings up

31:33.208 --> 31:36.917
a very serious possibility.

31:36.959 --> 31:39.709
What if there's an outside

31:36.959 --> 31:39.709
influence at work here?

31:39.750 --> 31:43.959
I detect no evidence

31:39.750 --> 31:43.959
of telepathic coercion.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.667
Commander, there is still one

31:44.000 --> 31:47.667
fact we have not considered--

31:47.709 --> 31:50.166
the abnormal energy reading

31:47.709 --> 31:50.166
in the Captain's quarters

31:50.208 --> 31:51.417
was never explained.

31:51.458 --> 31:52.375
It is not enough

31:52.417 --> 31:54.291
evidence

31:52.417 --> 31:54.291
to justify mutiny.

31:54.333 --> 31:57.125
Nobody has suggested

31:54.333 --> 31:57.125
removing the Captain

31:54.333 --> 31:57.125
from command.

31:57.166 --> 32:00.000
Right now, all we

31:57.166 --> 32:00.000
have are suspicions

32:00.041 --> 32:02.333
not enough to act on.

32:02.375 --> 32:04.709
The next move is his.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.542
THOLL:

32:04.750 --> 32:06.542
Well, Picard

32:06.583 --> 32:09.834
prove to us

32:06.583 --> 32:09.834
you're not the enemy.

32:09.875 --> 32:11.542
I can't.

32:13.083 --> 32:14.959
You're right,

32:13.083 --> 32:14.959
Mr. Tholl.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.500
Any one of us may be the enemy

32:18.542 --> 32:22.041
and there is no way

32:18.542 --> 32:22.041
to prove that we aren't.

32:22.083 --> 32:25.083
But until we set aside

32:22.083 --> 32:25.083
our mutual fears

32:25.125 --> 32:29.417
and trust one another,

32:25.125 --> 32:29.417
we have no hope of escape.

32:29.458 --> 32:32.792
But, sir, how can we

32:29.458 --> 32:32.792
trust each other?

32:32.834 --> 32:34.125
She's right.

32:34.166 --> 32:36.458
There may be

32:34.166 --> 32:36.458
an enemy among us.

32:36.500 --> 32:37.959
And what if there

32:36.500 --> 32:37.959
is, Mr. Tholl?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.792
Shall we continue

32:38.000 --> 32:40.792
accusing one another

32:40.834 --> 32:43.500
until hostility leads

32:40.834 --> 32:43.500
to violence?

32:43.542 --> 32:47.917
Shall we allow our suspicions

32:43.542 --> 32:47.917
to destroy us?

32:50.500 --> 32:55.792
Now, let's see if we can

32:50.500 --> 32:55.792
override this stun mechanism.

33:00.959 --> 33:05.375
Helm, take us in

33:00.959 --> 33:05.375
to 20 million kilometers.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.333
WESLEY:

33:05.417 --> 33:07.333
Aye, sir.

33:07.375 --> 33:10.583
Mr. Worf, divert enough

33:07.375 --> 33:10.583
power to the shields

33:10.625 --> 33:13.417
to offset the increased

33:10.625 --> 33:13.417
radiation and magnetic fields.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.166
Sir, at 20 million kilometers

33:16.208 --> 33:17.667
our shields will

33:16.208 --> 33:17.667
only be effective

33:17.709 --> 33:19.041
for 18 minutes.

33:19.083 --> 33:22.500
Noted, Mr. Data.

33:22.542 --> 33:28.041
Captain, may I have

33:22.542 --> 33:28.041
a word with you?

33:29.458 --> 33:31.458
PICARD:

33:29.458 --> 33:31.458
You have the Bridge,

33:29.458 --> 33:31.458
Mr. Data.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.083
Aye, sir.

33:37.208 --> 33:39.125
What is our mission?

33:39.166 --> 33:42.542
I'm under no obligation

33:39.166 --> 33:42.542
to tell you that.

33:42.583 --> 33:47.125
If you don't, you force me

33:42.583 --> 33:47.125
to take command of this vessel.

33:47.166 --> 33:48.500
On what grounds?

33:48.542 --> 33:51.250
You are endangering this ship

33:48.542 --> 33:51.250
for no reason.

33:51.291 --> 33:53.000
No reason you're aware of.

33:53.041 --> 33:54.500
That's not

33:53.041 --> 33:54.500
good enough.

33:54.542 --> 33:57.041
Your behavior has been erratic.

33:57.083 --> 34:00.875
Erratic enough

33:57.083 --> 34:00.875
to justify mutiny?

34:00.917 --> 34:02.917
Do you

34:00.917 --> 34:02.917
honestly

34:00.917 --> 34:02.917
believe

34:02.959 --> 34:06.625
you have sufficient evidence

34:02.959 --> 34:06.625
to convince a Board of Inquiry?

34:06.667 --> 34:08.709
No, I don't.

34:08.750 --> 34:12.125
But I can't let you risk

34:08.750 --> 34:12.125
the lives of this crew.

34:12.166 --> 34:17.208
Number One,

34:12.166 --> 34:17.208
has it occurred to you

34:17.250 --> 34:20.709
that<i> you</i> might be the one

34:17.250 --> 34:20.709
with the problem?

34:21.875 --> 34:23.667
I'm aware you've

34:21.875 --> 34:23.667
been under stress

34:23.709 --> 34:25.625
and I am willing to

34:23.709 --> 34:25.625
let the matter drop

34:25.667 --> 34:28.250
if you will report to Sick

34:25.667 --> 34:28.250
Bay for a full examination.

34:28.291 --> 34:33.625
Otherwise, I will have

34:28.291 --> 34:33.625
to relieve you from duty.

34:33.667 --> 34:35.875
Think about it.

34:36.917 --> 34:40.125
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

34:58.542 --> 34:59.750
Cadet.

35:02.291 --> 35:04.208
(<i> clicking</i> )

35:09.875 --> 35:13.375
I may have

35:09.875 --> 35:13.375
overloaded it, sir.

35:14.834 --> 35:17.625
(<i> grunting</i> )

35:17.667 --> 35:18.834
Mr. Tholl!

35:18.875 --> 35:21.792
I still think this is a mistake.

35:31.208 --> 35:32.583
Now what?

35:32.625 --> 35:35.458
We're no better off

35:32.625 --> 35:35.458
than when we started.

35:47.834 --> 35:50.542
Captain, number four shield

35:47.834 --> 35:50.542
has failed.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.125
Increasing power to number three

35:50.583 --> 35:53.125
shield to compensate.

35:53.166 --> 35:55.333
Helm, move us closer.

35:55.375 --> 35:57.000
Ten million kilometers.

35:57.041 --> 36:00.041
DATA:

35:57.041 --> 36:00.041
Sir, at that distance

36:00.083 --> 36:02.709
the ship will not withstand the

36:00.083 --> 36:02.709
magnetic fields and radiation.

36:02.750 --> 36:04.625
We will not

36:02.750 --> 36:04.625
survive.

36:04.667 --> 36:07.208
Take us in, Mr. Crusher.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.583
Belay that order.

36:14.500 --> 36:17.458
You're relieved of duty,

36:14.500 --> 36:17.458
Commander.

36:17.500 --> 36:21.875
Mr. Worf, confine Mr. Riker

36:17.500 --> 36:21.875
to his quarters.

36:44.625 --> 36:46.625
Mr. Worf,

36:44.625 --> 36:46.625
I gave you an order.

36:46.667 --> 36:49.333
Maintain your position,

36:46.667 --> 36:49.333
Lieutenant.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.709
You're destroying yourself

36:51.750 --> 36:53.959
and anyone foolish enough

36:51.750 --> 36:53.959
to listen to you.

36:55.458 --> 36:59.041
You've shown none of the concern

36:55.458 --> 36:59.041
Captain Picard would

36:59.083 --> 37:04.291
for the safety of this ship,

36:59.083 --> 37:04.291
the welfare of his crew.

37:05.709 --> 37:08.041
Mr. Worf, escort Commander Riker

37:05.709 --> 37:08.041
from the Bridge.

37:13.250 --> 37:15.583
Ensign Crusher,

37:13.250 --> 37:15.583
take us away from this pulsar.

37:15.625 --> 37:19.458
Heading 185 mark

37:15.625 --> 37:19.458
32, full impulse.

37:28.875 --> 37:31.125
Full impulse.

37:28.875 --> 37:31.125
Aye, Commander.

37:31.166 --> 37:33.208
Engage.

37:38.166 --> 37:40.709
I hope you're

37:38.166 --> 37:40.709
satisfied, Picard.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.458
You've accomplished

37:40.750 --> 37:42.458
nothing.

37:42.500 --> 37:46.542
The sound of your voice

37:42.500 --> 37:46.542
is beginning to anger me.

37:49.250 --> 37:52.583
Well...

37:52.625 --> 37:56.792
I think this charade

37:52.625 --> 37:56.792
has gone far enough.

37:56.834 --> 37:58.583
Don't you?

37:58.625 --> 38:00.458
I don't understand.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.250
Oh, yes, you do.

38:02.291 --> 38:05.750
This isn't a holding cell.

38:05.792 --> 38:10.291
It's a laboratory maze,

38:05.792 --> 38:10.291
a carefully structured test.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.709
It's an experiment to see

38:10.333 --> 38:12.709
how well we react

38:12.750 --> 38:13.750
under pressure.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.166
How do you know?

38:15.208 --> 38:17.583
It's the only explanation.

38:17.625 --> 38:19.750
Look at the four of us.

38:19.792 --> 38:21.875
We do have something

38:19.792 --> 38:21.875
in common--

38:21.917 --> 38:25.458
we all react differently

38:21.917 --> 38:25.458
to authority.

38:25.500 --> 38:30.750
You, the collaborator,

38:25.500 --> 38:30.750
defer to whoever has control

38:30.792 --> 38:35.500
you, the anarchist,

38:30.792 --> 38:35.500
reject authority in any form.

38:35.542 --> 38:39.417
I, a Starfleet Captain,

38:35.542 --> 38:39.417
trained to command

38:39.458 --> 38:41.667
and you...

38:41.709 --> 38:44.166
a Starfleet cadet

38:44.208 --> 38:47.667
sworn to obey a superior

38:44.208 --> 38:47.667
officer's authority.

38:47.709 --> 38:49.709
Our captors have placed us here

38:49.750 --> 38:52.917
and have devised obstacles

38:49.750 --> 38:52.917
for us to overcome.

38:52.959 --> 38:54.291
They give us food

38:54.333 --> 38:58.500
which Esoqq can't eat,

38:54.333 --> 38:58.500
to make him a threat.

38:58.542 --> 39:02.750
They give us a door

38:58.542 --> 39:02.750
we can't open

39:02.792 --> 39:05.875
until the four

39:02.792 --> 39:05.875
of us cooperate

39:05.917 --> 39:08.000
and each time

39:05.917 --> 39:08.000
we succeed

39:08.041 --> 39:10.542
they deal us reverses

39:10.583 --> 39:12.625
to set us

39:10.583 --> 39:12.625
against each other again

39:12.667 --> 39:17.917
while<i> you</i> observe

39:12.667 --> 39:17.917
our reactions.

39:17.959 --> 39:21.750
Sir, I've been trying to help.

39:21.792 --> 39:24.500
I found it unlikely

39:21.792 --> 39:24.500
that a first-year cadet

39:24.542 --> 39:27.083
would know of the<i> Enterprise's</i>

39:24.542 --> 39:27.083
visit to Mintaka III

39:27.125 --> 39:29.625
so I tested you.

39:29.667 --> 39:31.542
Starfleet has classified

39:31.583 --> 39:34.792
the Cor Caroli V plague

39:31.583 --> 39:34.792
as "secret."

39:34.834 --> 39:39.625
No cadet would

39:34.834 --> 39:39.625
have knowledge

39:34.834 --> 39:39.625
of that incident.

39:39.667 --> 39:40.792
Captain...

39:40.834 --> 39:43.417
So you may as well

39:40.834 --> 39:43.417
drop this pretense.

39:43.458 --> 39:45.041
I'm not playing any further.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.458
I'm quitting this game.

39:46.500 --> 39:50.208
As far as I am concerned

39:46.500 --> 39:50.208
this experiment is over!

39:53.000 --> 39:56.792
(<i> voice resonating</i> ):

39:53.000 --> 39:56.792
You are correct, Captain Picard.

40:03.792 --> 40:06.417
To further our knowledge

40:03.792 --> 40:06.417
of alien interaction

40:06.458 --> 40:10.291
we borrowed you, Tholl and Esoqq

40:06.458 --> 40:10.291
and replaced you with replicas.

40:10.333 --> 40:11.709
Replicas?

40:11.750 --> 40:14.417
Our transporter is able

40:11.750 --> 40:14.417
to replicate living matter

40:14.458 --> 40:16.917
including the brain's many

40:14.458 --> 40:16.917
trillion dendritic connections

40:16.959 --> 40:18.250
where memory is stored.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.250
THOLL:

40:18.291 --> 40:20.250
You mean, there's

40:18.291 --> 40:20.250
a copy of me

40:20.291 --> 40:21.542
on Mizar II?

40:21.583 --> 40:23.125
An impostor running my ship?

40:23.166 --> 40:24.625
No longer.

40:24.667 --> 40:27.083
Commander Riker has taken charge

40:24.667 --> 40:27.083
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

40:27.125 --> 40:29.083
Our species is

40:27.125 --> 40:29.083
telepathically linked.

40:29.125 --> 40:31.208
We are all in

40:29.125 --> 40:31.208
continual contact.

40:31.250 --> 40:34.667
Much more efficient than your

40:31.250 --> 40:34.667
primitive vocal communications.

40:34.709 --> 40:37.500
We would like to...

40:34.709 --> 40:37.500
pursue this study

40:37.542 --> 40:40.500
but, of course, your awareness

40:37.542 --> 40:40.500
of it would taint the results.

40:40.542 --> 40:43.542
We will, therefore, return you

40:40.542 --> 40:43.542
to your places of origin.

40:52.750 --> 40:53.917
Captain!

40:53.959 --> 40:55.125
Hold your

40:53.959 --> 40:55.125
positions.

40:55.166 --> 40:57.166
Take no action.

41:07.750 --> 41:09.417
Why did you choose to study

41:09.458 --> 41:12.041
the concepts

41:09.458 --> 41:12.041
of authority

41:09.458 --> 41:12.041
and leadership?

41:12.083 --> 41:15.375
Because our species

41:12.083 --> 41:15.375
has no such concepts.

41:15.417 --> 41:16.667
As we are all identical

41:16.709 --> 41:18.792
distinctions among ourselves

41:16.709 --> 41:18.792
are meaningless.

41:18.834 --> 41:21.041
Hence, we have

41:18.834 --> 41:21.041
no leaders no followers.

41:21.083 --> 41:23.333
We wanted to examine the nature

41:21.083 --> 41:23.333
of command.

41:23.375 --> 41:25.583
Our replicas

41:23.375 --> 41:25.583
of Tholl and Esoqq

41:25.625 --> 41:27.959
explored this issue

41:25.625 --> 41:27.959
on Mizar II and on Chalna

41:28.000 --> 41:30.041
just as our Picard

41:28.000 --> 41:30.041
replica did

41:30.083 --> 41:31.125
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

41:31.166 --> 41:32.208
Your responses were

41:32.250 --> 41:33.500
most intriguing.

41:33.542 --> 41:35.959
You have no right

41:33.542 --> 41:35.959
to put us through this

41:36.000 --> 41:38.458
just to satisfy your curiosity.

41:40.291 --> 41:41.542
Why not?

41:41.583 --> 41:44.000
Because kidnapping

41:41.583 --> 41:44.000
is an immoral assault.

41:44.041 --> 41:46.458
The rights of other races

41:44.041 --> 41:46.458
must be respected.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.375
This concept

41:46.500 --> 41:48.375
of morality

41:48.417 --> 41:50.583
is a very interesting

41:48.417 --> 41:50.583
human characteristic.

41:50.625 --> 41:51.542
We shall have

41:51.583 --> 41:52.625
to study it

41:51.583 --> 41:52.625
sometime.

41:52.667 --> 41:53.750
Now, Mr. Worf.

41:55.917 --> 41:59.792
(<i> grunting in pain</i> )

42:02.375 --> 42:03.667
What is it?

42:03.709 --> 42:05.125
Why do you hold us?

42:05.166 --> 42:08.834
Because there is something else

42:05.166 --> 42:08.834
you can learn.

42:08.875 --> 42:10.583
With an alert crew

42:10.625 --> 42:15.250
even our "primitive vocal

42:10.625 --> 42:15.250
communications" are unnecessary.

42:15.291 --> 42:18.375
With a single look,

42:15.291 --> 42:18.375
I was able to inform my crew

42:18.417 --> 42:19.917
that I wanted to hold you here.

42:19.959 --> 42:21.458
But why?

42:21.500 --> 42:22.542
Because I have decided

42:22.583 --> 42:24.208
to conduct an experiment

42:22.583 --> 42:24.208
of my own.

42:24.250 --> 42:28.000
I want to see

42:24.250 --> 42:28.000
how<i> you</i> react to

42:24.250 --> 42:28.000
being imprisoned.

42:28.041 --> 42:30.083
Captain, our species

42:28.041 --> 42:30.083
cannot bear captivity.

42:30.125 --> 42:32.583
We were merely

42:30.125 --> 42:32.583
curious.

42:30.125 --> 42:32.583
We meant no harm.

42:32.625 --> 42:35.041
We did not, after all,

42:32.625 --> 42:35.041
injure you in any way.

42:35.083 --> 42:36.875
Imprisonment is an injury

42:36.917 --> 42:39.542
regardless

42:36.917 --> 42:39.542
of how you justify it.

42:45.834 --> 42:47.000
(<i> crying out</i> )

42:47.041 --> 42:49.250
(<i> gasping</i> )

42:53.166 --> 42:55.750
(<i> breathing slows</i> )

42:55.792 --> 42:58.750
PICARD:

42:55.792 --> 42:58.750
And now that you have had

42:55.792 --> 42:58.750
a taste of captivity

42:58.792 --> 43:01.583
perhaps you will reconsider

42:58.792 --> 43:01.583
the morality

43:01.625 --> 43:02.875
of inflicting it

43:01.625 --> 43:02.875
on others.

43:02.917 --> 43:05.458
In any event, we

43:02.917 --> 43:05.458
now know of your race

43:05.500 --> 43:08.500
and we know how to imprison you.

43:08.542 --> 43:11.125
Bear that in mind.

43:11.166 --> 43:13.834
Now get off my ship.

43:17.250 --> 43:20.333
Mr. Crusher, set

43:17.250 --> 43:20.333
course to rendezvous

43:17.250 --> 43:20.333
with the<i> Hood.</i> Warp 8.

43:20.375 --> 43:23.208
Aye, sir. It's good

43:20.375 --> 43:23.208
to have you back, sir.

43:24.709 --> 43:26.083
Status, Number One?

43:27.458 --> 43:30.166
Ship and crew

43:27.458 --> 43:30.166
functioning normally, Captain.

43:30.208 --> 43:35.041
Then my doppelganger caused

43:30.208 --> 43:35.041
no serious damage?

43:35.083 --> 43:36.959
The replica was convincing.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.083
Very convincing, but...

43:37.000 --> 43:41.083
not perfect.

43:41.125 --> 43:43.125
Not perfect in what way?

43:43.166 --> 43:45.792
Well, sir...

43:45.834 --> 43:48.875
I find it hard to believe

43:45.834 --> 43:48.875
that you're that good a singer.

43:48.917 --> 43:51.375
Singer?

43:54.041 --> 43:57.709
I look forward to reading

43:54.041 --> 43:57.709
your report, Commander.

43:57.750 --> 43:59.375
At least, I think I do.

43:59.417 --> 44:00.834
(<i> door opens</i> )

44:06.959 --> 44:08.875
Doctor.

44:11.709 --> 44:13.125
Captain.

44:17.792 --> 44:20.458
WESLEY:

44:17.792 --> 44:20.458
Course laid in, sir.

44:26.750 --> 44:29.500
Engage.
