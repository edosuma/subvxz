00:00.841 --> 00:01.882
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BUNHEADS"...</i>

00:01.882 --> 00:03.203
I THINK I FORGOT
TO FINISH HIGH SCHOOL.

00:03.203 --> 00:05.045
I'M A DROPOUT.
NOT EVEN A DROPOUT‐‐

00:05.045 --> 00:06.607
DROPPING OUT
IMPLIES ACTION.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.769
I JUST...
DIDN'T FINISH.

00:08.769 --> 00:11.211
MY DAD AND FAYE MENDELSON
SET THE WEDDING LOCATION.

00:11.211 --> 00:13.453
‐ FUN.
‐ IT'S THE SAME PLACE
HE MARRIED MY MOM.

00:13.453 --> 00:14.895
NO WAY.

00:14.895 --> 00:17.377
THE DAY I LOST MY HUSBAND
WAS THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE.

00:17.377 --> 00:20.941
OF COURSE I LOST HIM TO
THE DIVORCEE IN THE JEGGINGS
ACROSS THE STREET.

00:20.941 --> 00:22.663
‐ SO WHAT'S UP WITH CHARLIE?
‐ WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:22.663 --> 00:24.825
WHAT DID HE DO
TO MAKE HER DUMP HIM?

00:24.825 --> 00:27.107
NOTHING.
HE WAS TOTALLY SMITTEN.

00:27.107 --> 00:28.789
( gasps )

00:28.789 --> 00:29.790
HERE'S TO BEING DUMB.

00:29.790 --> 00:31.712
I HAVE A MASTERS
IN OCEANOGRAPHY.

00:31.712 --> 00:33.834
SO THEY LET HIGH SCHOOL
DROPOUTS GET PhDS?

00:33.834 --> 00:35.916
I DIDN'T SAY I WAS
A HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT.

00:35.916 --> 00:37.878
I'M GUESSING THAT
YOU AND ME TONIGHT,
WE'RE NOT‐‐

00:37.878 --> 00:39.640
NO. NOT TONIGHT.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.281
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?
MAYBE YOU CAN UN‐SAY IT.

00:41.281 --> 00:42.923
‐ IN A BETTER OUTFIT.
‐ DID HE SAY SOMETHING
BAD TO YOU?

00:45.886 --> 00:47.367
SAW YOUR MOVES.

00:47.367 --> 00:48.929
BARTENDER, THE GIRL.

00:48.929 --> 00:50.531
<i>I THINK YOU MIGHT DIG IT.</i>

00:53.213 --> 00:55.616
<i>FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.</i>

01:03.183 --> 01:04.585
STOP.

01:04.585 --> 01:08.068
EVERYONE, JUST STOP.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.471
YOU JUST KILLED
BARYSHNIKOV.

01:11.471 --> 01:13.594
( exhales )

01:13.594 --> 01:15.355
WELL, WOULD YOU MIND
SHOWING US THE COMBINATION

01:15.355 --> 01:16.476
AGAIN, JORDAN?

01:16.476 --> 01:17.758
OH, SURE.

01:17.758 --> 01:19.279
WHAT HAVE I GOT
BUT LOADS OF TIME

01:19.279 --> 01:20.761
AND SINCERE ENTHUSIASM

01:20.761 --> 01:22.603
TO SHOW YOU THE SAME
FREAKING THING

01:22.603 --> 01:24.525
OVER AND OVER AGAIN?

01:24.525 --> 01:25.566
MOVE.

01:39.620 --> 01:40.621
DO THAT.

01:45.586 --> 01:46.827
THEY KILL BARYSHNIKOV
AGAIN?

01:46.827 --> 01:48.188
YEP.

01:48.188 --> 01:49.910
I JUST NEED TO DO
SOMETHING ON THE
COMPUTER HERE.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.593
I'LL BE SUPER QUICK.
QUIET AS A MOUSE.

01:52.593 --> 01:54.835
<i>( computer dings )</i>

01:54.835 --> 01:56.677
FROM NOW ON,
JORDAN, SIR.

01:58.879 --> 01:59.840
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN,
EVERYONE.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.802
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

02:01.802 --> 02:03.844
SHARPER, RAY‐RAY.

02:05.846 --> 02:08.208
CLEANER, GINNY.
CLEANER.

02:08.208 --> 02:09.850
BE SMALLER, BOO.

02:09.850 --> 02:12.212
‐ SMALLER?
‐ DON'T TALK BACK.

02:12.212 --> 02:14.775
MATISSE, STOP.
STOP!

02:14.775 --> 02:16.376
FOCUS, OKAY.

02:16.376 --> 02:17.778
WITHOUT FOCUS, YOUR LIFE
IS GONNA BE JUMPING

02:17.778 --> 02:19.700
FROM ALCOHOLIC
BOYFRIEND TO ANOTHER.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.021
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

02:21.021 --> 02:22.903
I DON'T THINK SO.

02:22.903 --> 02:24.464
HEY, JORDAN,
LET'S TAKE FIVE HERE.

02:24.464 --> 02:25.826
<i>THEY LOOK LIKE</i>
<i>THEY NEED A BREAK.</i>

02:25.826 --> 02:28.749
WHEN DON'T THEY?
TAKE FIVE.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.671
JORDAN, YOUR GROUP
IS WILTING HERE.

02:30.671 --> 02:31.672
AND THE KIDS
IN THE CORNER,

02:31.672 --> 02:32.753
WHAT'S UP WITH THEM?

02:32.753 --> 02:33.754
THEY WANTED TO
STRETCH BEFORE CLASS.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.755
I MEAN,
COME ON.

02:34.755 --> 02:35.996
"BE SMALLER."

02:35.996 --> 02:37.077
WHAT A JERK.

02:37.077 --> 02:38.679
I HATE HIM
SO MUCH.

02:38.679 --> 02:39.760
ME TOO.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.201
BUT I'M ALSO
IN LOVE WITH HIM.

02:41.201 --> 02:42.282
ME TOO.

02:42.282 --> 02:43.764
‐ BUT NOT ANYMORE.
‐ SAME HERE.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.606
HE'S SO INSANE TODAY.
HE HASN'T EVEN NOTICED

02:45.606 --> 02:47.167
‐ THAT MELANIE ISN'T HERE.
‐ WHY ISN'T SHE HERE?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.809
HE'S LOOKING.

02:48.809 --> 02:49.850
‐ THEY'RE BEING
BABIED AROUND.
‐ ABSOLUTELY NOT.

02:49.850 --> 02:51.011
YOU'RE NOT CHALLENGING
THEM ENOUGH.

02:51.011 --> 02:52.452
YOU CAN SEE IT
IN THEIR DANCING,

02:52.452 --> 02:53.654
THEIR BARRE WORK,
THEIR LEGS,

02:53.654 --> 02:54.895
‐ THEIR POSTURE.
‐ JORDAN.

02:54.895 --> 02:56.336
EVERYTHING THEY DO,
IT'S NOT CORRECT.

02:56.336 --> 02:58.939
WE'RE TALKING A BREAK.
WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

02:58.939 --> 03:01.301
BASTARD'S GOTTEN
INTO MY HEAD.

03:01.301 --> 03:03.463
SASHA'S AWOL TOO,
BY THE WAY.

03:03.463 --> 03:04.785
WELL, I KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.106
APARTMENT HUNTING,
AND SHE FOUND ONE.

03:06.106 --> 03:07.828
‐ REALLY?
‐ IN THAT BUILDING
HER AUNT OWNS.

03:07.828 --> 03:09.429
‐ SHE MOVES IN NEXT WEEK.
‐ WHO'S SHE LIVING WITH?

03:09.429 --> 03:10.551
NO ONE.
IT'S JUST HER.

03:10.551 --> 03:11.872
HER OWN APARTMENT?

03:11.872 --> 03:13.754
I USED TO DREAM ABOUT
GETTING MARRIED TO JORDAN

03:13.754 --> 03:15.756
AND LIVING IN
OUR OWN APARTMENT.

03:15.756 --> 03:17.718
KISSING HIM ON THE CHEEK
WHEN HE COMES HOME,

03:17.718 --> 03:19.720
<i>AND MAKING DINNER</i>
<i>FOR HIM EVERY NIGHT.</i>

03:19.720 --> 03:21.441
‐ BUT NOT ANYMORE.
‐ SAME HERE.

03:21.441 --> 03:23.083
HE'S BEEN A JERK
FOREVER, MATISSE.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.685
ARE YOU JUST
CATCHING UP?

03:24.685 --> 03:27.207
‐ <i>( phone ringing )</i>
‐ BOO, THAT'S YOUR PHONE.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.209

<i>INTO MY BACKGROUND.</i>
‐ Jordan: <i>NONE OF THEM ARE ME.</i>

03:29.209 --> 03:30.490
<i>THEY DON'T WANT</i>
<i>TO BE YOU.</i>

03:30.490 --> 03:32.332
WHO WOULDN'T
WANT TO BE ME?

03:32.332 --> 03:34.094
MOM, HEY, I'M AT CLASS
SO MAKE IT QUICK.

03:34.094 --> 03:36.216
THE TV FELL OVER?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.779
DID IT FALL ON ANYONE?

03:38.779 --> 03:40.781
HOW CAN YOU
NOT BE SURE?

03:40.781 --> 03:42.102
BETTER NOT
LET HIM SEE YOU.

03:42.102 --> 03:43.544
<i>I KNOW YOU CAN DO THAT.</i>
<i>I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.</i>

03:43.544 --> 03:44.865
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

03:44.865 --> 03:45.906
PLEASE STOP DOING THAT!

03:45.906 --> 03:47.628
SO JUST LONNIE IS MISSING?

03:47.628 --> 03:49.109
WELL, DO YOU SEE
ANY PARTS OF LONNIE

03:49.109 --> 03:50.711

UNDER THE TV?

03:50.711 --> 03:52.553
<i>YEAH, I'LL WAIT.</i>

03:52.553 --> 03:53.834
UH, BOO?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.636

03:55.636 --> 03:57.157
‐ <i>GOOD. THIS IS GOOD.</i>

03:57.157 --> 04:00.160
BOO.

04:00.160 --> 04:01.962

04:01.962 --> 04:03.764
‐ NO.
‐ <i>( yelling, thumping )</i>

04:03.764 --> 04:06.687
WAIT, WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT SCREAMING?

04:06.687 --> 04:08.529
IT'S GRANT AND DOMINIK.
THEY'RE LOCKED IN
THE DRESSING ROOM.

04:08.529 --> 04:10.450
‐ WHY?
‐ THEY KNOW WHY.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.772
( sighs )
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

04:11.772 --> 04:13.614
GATHER AROUND.
NEXT STEP.

04:18.378 --> 04:19.459

YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING
FOR TWO DAYS,

YOU WANT TO
GIVE IT A SHOT?

05:36.617 --> 05:37.618

‐ YOU'RE LATE.
‐ SO IS EVERYONE ELSE.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.634
THEY CALLED.
YOU DIDN'T.

05:53.634 --> 05:55.435
I WAS AT BALLET.
MICHELLE KEPT US OVER.

05:55.435 --> 05:56.797
THEN I'LL COMPLAIN
TO MICHELLE.

05:56.797 --> 05:58.559
SHE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG,

05:58.559 --> 05:59.840
SO DON'T CALL HER.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.843

THEIR KIDS' COLLEGE

‐ AT KINDERGARTEN.
‐ THAT'S A SICKNESS.

06:10.450 --> 06:12.092
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
LEAVE YOUR KEYS.

06:12.092 --> 06:13.774
I PARKED
MY OWN CAR.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.776
AFTER RUNNING IT
THROUGH THE VALET AREA.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.377
IS THAT WHY ALL
THOSE CHINESE GUYS

06:17.377 --> 06:18.859

AWFUL COLD.

06:25.866 --> 06:26.867
MOM HAS A COLD?

06:27.988 --> 06:29.950
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING
TO DRINK, CLAIRE?

06:29.950 --> 06:31.952
I'D LOVE A DRINK.

06:31.952 --> 06:33.473
CAN YOU DO
A GAY MARINE?

06:33.473 --> 06:35.796
<i>YOU JUST MUDDLE</i>
<i>SOME MINT LEAVES</i>
<i>AND SOME LIME</i>

06:35.796 --> 06:37.638
<i>WITH CANE SUGAR</i>
<i>AND ORANGE LIQUEUR</i>

06:37.638 --> 06:39.520
AND THEN YOU ADD
SOME ICE AND SOME RUM

06:39.520 --> 06:40.921
AND YOU TOP IT ALL
WITH APPLE JUICE.

06:40.921 --> 06:41.962
<i>IT'S A CHINESE</i>
<i>RESTAURANT, MOM.</i>

06:41.962 --> 06:43.564
THEY DON'T DO
GAY MARINES.

06:43.564 --> 06:46.086
WHITE WINE
IS OKAY, I GUESS.

06:46.086 --> 06:47.768
I'LL HAVE WHATEVER

07:14.955 --> 07:16.717
SO HOW'S THE REAL‐ESTATE

I MEAN, I KNOW
YOU KNEW HIM FIRST,

SOME SAUCY THINGS

A BOX?

08:18.779 --> 08:20.340
THAT'S MY BRIDESMAID DRESS.

08:20.340 --> 08:22.022

BE A MISTAKE.
‐ IT'S NOT.

08:22.022 --> 08:23.784
IT'S A GIANT
RECTANGLE, WHY?

08:23.784 --> 08:25.946
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
I GO TO MY DAD AND
FAYE'S PLACE,

08:25.946 --> 08:27.187
FAYE STARES
AT MY BOOBS.

08:27.187 --> 08:28.749
SHE TOLD MY DAD
THAT THEY REMIND HER

08:28.749 --> 08:30.631
OF MY MOM'S BOOBS
AND SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE REMINDED

08:30.631 --> 08:31.872
OF MY MOM'S BOOBS
AT THE WEDDING.

08:31.872 --> 08:33.794
SO SHE'S FORCING ME
TO WEAR A DRESS

08:33.794 --> 08:34.955
SHAPED LIKE
A SHOWER CURTAIN.

08:34.955 --> 08:36.557
CRUEL AND UNUSUAL.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.559
( sighs )
I DON'T WANT TO
LOOK AT IT ANYMORE.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.760
SO WHERE HAVE
YOU BEEN?

08:39.760 --> 08:40.841
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:40.841 --> 08:41.842
I MEAN WHERE
HAVE YOU BEEN?

08:41.842 --> 08:42.843
I NEVER
SEE YOU ANYMORE.

08:42.843 --> 08:44.364
I SEE YOU EVERY DAY
AT SCHOOL.

08:44.364 --> 08:45.766
YOU'RE SKIPPING BALLET.
YOU DON'T ANSWER MY TEXTS.

08:45.766 --> 08:47.528
DAD'S GOT ME
TOURING COLLEGES.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.249
‐ REALLY?
‐ WE JUST GOT BACK
FROM DRIVING AROUND

08:49.249 --> 08:50.611
U. C. SANTA BARBARA.

08:50.611 --> 08:51.772
‐ REALLY?
‐ YEAH.

08:51.772 --> 08:53.614
OKAY, WELL AT LEAST
ANSWER MY TEXTS.

08:53.614 --> 08:54.775
SOME OF THEM ARE
EVEN IMPORTANT.

08:54.775 --> 08:55.776
I WILL.
I PROMISE.

08:55.776 --> 08:57.778
HERE.

08:57.778 --> 08:58.939
WHILE YOU HAVE A SHOT.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.060
GOOD THINKING.

09:09.429 --> 09:11.431
<i>( laughing )</i>

09:13.634 --> 09:15.435
OF ALL THE GIN JOINTS
IN ALL THE TOWNS

09:15.435 --> 09:18.358
IN ALL THE WORLD,
SHE HAS TO WALK INTO MINE.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.200
"CASABLANCA."

09:20.200 --> 09:21.602
I KNOW "CASABLANCA".

09:21.602 --> 09:23.604
‐ OKAY.
‐ I'VE SEEN "CASABLANCA."

09:23.604 --> 09:25.325
I CAN SPELL
CASABLANCA.

09:25.325 --> 09:26.687
I'VE BEEN TO
CASABLANCA.

09:26.687 --> 09:27.928
I WAS JUST
TRYING TO BE CUTE.

09:27.928 --> 09:29.089
I THOUGHT "HEY THERE"
WOULD BE BORING

09:29.089 --> 09:30.090
SO I THOUGHT
I'D THROW IN A‐‐

09:30.090 --> 09:32.613
NEVER MIND.
STARTING AGAIN.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.775
‐ HEY THERE.
‐ HEY.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.176
‐ FOR ME?
‐ YEP.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.618
‐ GUILT GIFT?
‐ YEP.

09:37.618 --> 09:38.779
I LIKE THE WRAPPING PAPER.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.180
IT'S MY 2004
TAX RETURN.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.221
NICE.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.705
"FINDING NEMO."

09:44.705 --> 09:45.906
SEE? IT'S THE PERFECT
THING FOR US

09:45.906 --> 09:46.787
'CAUSE YOU'RE AN EXPERT
ON THE OCEAN,

09:46.787 --> 09:48.188
AND I LIKE
TALKING FISH.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.750
VERY NICE.
THANK YOU.

09:50.951 --> 09:52.112
SORRY FOR WHAT I SAID.

09:52.112 --> 09:53.794
NO WORRIES.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.636
I TALK, THEREFORE I AM.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.157
NOT ALWAYS
A BAD THING.

09:57.157 --> 09:59.279
CAN I BUY YOU
A DRINK?

09:59.279 --> 10:01.522
YES, YOU CAN.

10:01.522 --> 10:03.163
SOMETHING WITH BOURBON
AND AN UMBRELLA.

10:03.163 --> 10:04.244
( laughing )

10:04.244 --> 10:05.766
WHAT ARE THEY
CELEBRATING?

10:05.766 --> 10:06.767
TUESDAY.

10:06.767 --> 10:08.529
MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY.

10:08.529 --> 10:10.450
‐ SO GUESS WHAT I DID?
‐ SAFER NOT TO.

10:10.450 --> 10:11.772
I WENT ONLINE
AND READ YOUR THESIS.

10:11.772 --> 10:14.615
‐ YOU'RE KIDDING.
‐ <i>NO.</i>

10:14.615 --> 10:15.776
( chuckles )
I'M IMPRESSED.

10:15.776 --> 10:16.857
WELL, DON'T BE.
I ONLY UNDERSTOOD

10:16.857 --> 10:18.338
ABOUT 1/10 OF IT.
PLANKTON.

10:18.338 --> 10:19.780
I GOT THAT.
AND YOUR NAME.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.421
AND I THINK
YOU MENTIONED ORCA

10:21.421 --> 10:22.783
AND I DID
SEE THAT MOVIE.

10:22.783 --> 10:23.944
THAT'S PROBABLY
LESS THAN 1/10, RIGHT?

10:23.944 --> 10:25.345
DID I MENTION
I DIDN'T FINISH
HIGH SCHOOL?

10:25.345 --> 10:26.907
POINTS FOR TRYING.

10:29.109 --> 10:31.191
GUESS THAT ALCOHOL BUZZ
IS STARTING TO WEAR OFF.

10:31.191 --> 10:33.353
YEP. NOW THEY
ALL GET TIRED.

10:33.353 --> 10:35.275
AND THE ONE ON THE DIET
EATS EVERY COLD FRENCH FRY

10:35.275 --> 10:36.356
SHE CAN FIND.

10:36.356 --> 10:37.437
THEY'LL PROBABLY
LEAVE SOON.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.999
AND THEN YOU'LL
BE ALL ALONE.

10:38.999 --> 10:40.801
MIGHT AS WELL
JUST CLOSE.

10:40.801 --> 10:42.643
WITH THE WHOLE NIGHT
AHEAD OF YOU?

10:42.643 --> 10:43.804
HOW WILL YOU
FILL THE TIME?

10:46.086 --> 10:47.688
AND THEN I GOT INTO
THIS WHOLE THING

10:47.688 --> 10:48.769
WITH THE LADY
I WAS UNDERSTUDYING

10:48.769 --> 10:50.771
'CAUSE I STARTED
DATING HER HUSBAND.

10:50.771 --> 10:53.173
THEY WERE SEPARATED‐‐
WELL, HE SAID THEY WERE
SEPARATED,

10:53.173 --> 10:54.575
BUT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
SOMETHING WAS WEIRD

10:54.575 --> 10:56.176
WHEN HE NEVER LET ME
COME OVER TO HIS HOUSE.

10:56.176 --> 10:58.939
I HAD TO GO TO THE CORNER
OF SIXTH AND 53RD

10:58.939 --> 11:00.781
AND GET IN LINE
AT THIS HALAL CART

11:00.781 --> 11:02.182
AND I WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO MOVE

11:02.182 --> 11:03.864
TILL HE SHOWED UP
AND DROPPED A NOTE
IN MY PURSE

11:03.864 --> 11:05.946
TELLING ME WHICH
HOTEL TO MEET HIM AT.

11:05.946 --> 11:07.427
AND SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE
A PHONE NUMBER FOR HIM,

11:07.427 --> 11:08.869
IF HE WAS LATE,
I JUST ORDERED,

11:08.869 --> 11:10.711
AND IF HE STILL DIDN'T
SHOW I HAD TO EAT

11:10.711 --> 11:12.793
'CAUSE OTHERWISE
I'M WEIRD. WHATEVER.

11:12.793 --> 11:14.434
THE POINT IS
SHE FINALLY FOUND OUT,

11:14.434 --> 11:15.956
GOT MAD AND THEN
NEVER MISSED A SHOW

11:15.956 --> 11:17.357
SO I NEVER
GOT TO GO ON.

11:17.357 --> 11:19.359
PLUS I SMELLED
LIKE GARLIC SAUCE
THE ENTIRE RUN.

11:19.359 --> 11:20.961
THAT IS NOT
A TRUE STORY.

11:20.961 --> 11:22.122
OKAY, FINE,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:22.122 --> 11:23.604
IT WAS
A MR. SOFTEE TRUCK.

11:23.604 --> 11:25.205
‐ ( chuckles )
‐ SCOTTY?

11:25.205 --> 11:27.407
YOU HAVE FLOWER POTS?
WHO GAVE YOU FLOWER POTS?

11:27.407 --> 11:28.408
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

11:28.408 --> 11:29.690
YOU KILL FLOWER POTS.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.811
THE FLOWERS AND THE POTS.
YOU WALK BY

11:30.811 --> 11:32.573
AND THEY FLING
THEMSELVES OFF WINDOWSILLS.

11:32.573 --> 11:34.575
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
ARE YOU A LOUNGE SINGER NOW?

11:34.575 --> 11:36.336
LONG STORIES
TO HAVE BEER BY.

11:36.336 --> 11:38.218
WOW, I JUST‐‐

11:38.218 --> 11:40.340
OH, SORRY. THIS IS
MY BROTHER SCOTTY.

11:40.340 --> 11:41.582
SCOTTY,
THIS IS GODOT.

11:41.582 --> 11:42.943
WELL, HELLO,
YOUNG MAN.

11:42.943 --> 11:44.344
I'M SO GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

11:44.344 --> 11:45.786
COME IN,
COME IN.

11:45.786 --> 11:47.948
OH BOY, I‐‐

11:47.948 --> 11:49.710
IT'S OKAY.
ANOTHER NIGHT.

11:49.710 --> 11:50.791
IT'S GOOD
TO MEET YOU.

11:50.791 --> 11:52.192
YOU TOO.

11:53.594 --> 11:55.195
SERIOUSLY?
EVEN MRS. ROBINSON'S

11:55.195 --> 11:56.196
GIVING YOU
A WEIRD LOOK RIGHT NOW.

11:56.196 --> 11:57.798
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
IN MADISON.

11:57.798 --> 11:59.960
WELL, A FUNNY THING HAPPENED
ON THE WAY TO MADISON.

12:03.483 --> 12:04.925
SO, MADISON.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.647
RIGHT. SO I WAS
ON MY WAY TO MADISON

12:06.647 --> 12:08.048
AND I STOPPED
AT THIS DINER

12:08.048 --> 12:09.610
AND THERE WAS
A HOSTESS.

12:09.610 --> 12:10.971
NOT EVEN A WAITRESS?

12:10.971 --> 12:12.452
A HOSTESS IS A STEP UP
FROM A WAITRESS.

12:12.452 --> 12:13.894
NO.

12:13.894 --> 12:15.055
YOU'RE A WAITRESS FIRST
AND THEN A HOSTESS.

12:15.055 --> 12:16.456
‐ IT'S A PROMOTION.
‐ NOT AT ALL.

12:16.456 --> 12:17.898
WELL,
SHE WAS A REDHEAD

12:17.898 --> 12:19.059
SO ONE THING LED
TO ANOTHER.

12:19.059 --> 12:20.260
OH NO.
YOU GOT MARRIED AGAIN?

12:20.260 --> 12:21.982
‐ NEVER MADE IT
OUT OF TUPELO.
‐ SCOTTY.

12:21.982 --> 12:23.223
I KNOW. I KNOW.

12:23.223 --> 12:24.304
HOW MANY MARRIAGES
DOES THIS MAKE?

12:24.304 --> 12:26.146
‐ FOUR?
‐ YOU'RE ASKING ME?

12:26.146 --> 12:28.148
NO, FOUR.
THIS MAKES FOUR.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.309
OH MY GOD.

12:29.309 --> 12:31.071
BUT YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS DIFFERENT.

12:31.071 --> 12:33.073
‐ HOW?
‐ SHE SPOKE VERY
LITTLE ENGLISH.

12:33.073 --> 12:34.314
PERFECT.

12:34.314 --> 12:36.236
BUT SHE HAD THESE
EYES THAT WERE EPIC.

12:36.236 --> 12:38.078
I FELT IF I COULD
JUST STARE IN THIS
WOMAN'S EYES

12:38.078 --> 12:39.399
FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE,

12:39.399 --> 12:41.081
I WOULD BE
A VERY HAPPY MAN.

12:41.081 --> 12:43.083
SO WHAT HAPPENED?
OOH, CAKE.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.085
WELL, THE FIRST
MONTH WAS GREAT.

12:45.085 --> 12:46.767
AND THEN WE
STARTED FIGHTING,

12:46.767 --> 12:48.168
AND THEN
WE GOT ENGAGED,

12:48.168 --> 12:49.209
THEN WE FOUGHT
SOME MORE,

12:49.209 --> 12:50.450
AND THEN I FOUND OUT
SHE WORE

12:50.450 --> 12:51.892
COLORED CONTACT
LENSES.

12:51.892 --> 12:53.614
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED,
BIG MISTAKE.

12:53.614 --> 12:55.135
WHAT ELSE WAS THERE
TO THINK?

12:55.135 --> 12:56.336
NEXT THING I KNOW,
IT'S THE DAY OF THE WEDDING

12:56.336 --> 12:58.058
I'M STANDING AT THE ALTAR
IN MY RENTED TUX

12:58.058 --> 12:59.139
AND SHE'S HURTLING
DOWN THE AISLE

12:59.139 --> 13:00.621
LIKE A GIANT
CRINOLINE COMET,

13:00.621 --> 13:01.902
AND I'M THINKING
TO MYSELF,

13:01.902 --> 13:03.463
"I HAVE GOT TO
GET OUT OF THIS."

13:03.463 --> 13:04.705
‐ SO YOU BOLTED.
‐ <i>YEAH.</i>

13:04.705 --> 13:06.426
‐ WHEN?
‐ RIGHT AFTER "YMCA."

13:06.426 --> 13:08.148
WELL, YOU DON'T
WANT TO MISS THAT.

13:08.148 --> 13:10.070
SO I WROTE HER A NOTE,
I GRABBED YOU SOME CAKE,

13:10.070 --> 13:11.512
AND I EXITED STAGE LEFT.

13:11.512 --> 13:12.993
CAN I GIVE YOU
A PIECE OF ADVICE?

13:12.993 --> 13:14.314
SURE.

13:14.314 --> 13:16.076
IF YOU KEEP GETTING ENGAGED
TO PERFECT STRANGERS

13:16.076 --> 13:17.397
AND THEN BAILING
ON THE WEDDING NIGHT,

13:17.397 --> 13:19.119
YOU HAVE TO BUY A TUX.

13:19.119 --> 13:20.601
I KEEP MARRYING
THE WRONG GIRL.

13:20.601 --> 13:22.082
YOU KEEP MARRYING MOM.

13:22.082 --> 13:23.524
WELL, THAT'S NOT TOO
DISTURBING OF A STATEMENT.

13:23.524 --> 13:25.085
WELL, IF THE CREEPY
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE FITS.

13:26.486 --> 13:28.128
YOU MIND IF I CRASH HERE
FOR A FEW DAYS?

13:28.128 --> 13:29.289
COUCH IS ALL YOURS.

13:29.289 --> 13:30.450
THANKS.

13:30.450 --> 13:33.133
WELL, SO,
THIS IS THE NEW PAD.

13:33.133 --> 13:34.895
IT'S NOT WHAT
I PICTURED AT ALL.

13:34.895 --> 13:36.216
NO?
WHAT'D YOU PICTURE?

13:36.216 --> 13:38.058
SOMETHING LESS DECORATED
AND WITHOUT A ROOF.

13:38.058 --> 13:39.379
YOU'RE HILARIOUS.

13:39.379 --> 13:40.621
HOW LONG DO YOU
PLAN TO BE HERE?

13:40.621 --> 13:42.102
WHY, YOU GONNA HAVE
YOUR MAIL FORWARDED?

13:42.102 --> 13:43.463
JUST ASKING.

13:43.463 --> 13:45.305
HOW ATTACHED ARE YOU
TO YOUR TOOTHBRUSH?

13:45.305 --> 13:47.067
THERE'S AN EXTRA ONE
UNDER THE SINK.

13:47.067 --> 13:50.631
I DON'T KNOW WHAT PROBLEM
YOU HAD WITH THIS GIRL,

13:50.631 --> 13:52.072
BUT BOY, COULD SHE
PICK A CAKE.

14:01.522 --> 14:03.684
I KNOW.
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT
THAT MUST HAVE FELT LIKE.

14:03.684 --> 14:05.165
HEY, I GREW UP WITH HIM.

14:05.165 --> 14:06.647
NO ONE KNOWS
HOW FLAKY HE IS
BETTER THAN ME.

14:06.647 --> 14:09.089
HEY, WHAT'D YOU DO
TO THE COFFEE GUY?
HE HATES YOUR GUTS.

14:09.089 --> 14:11.171
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
SEND IT ALL C. O. D.

14:11.171 --> 14:13.133
TOSS IT IN A BOX,
TAPE IT UP AND SHIP IT OFF.

14:13.133 --> 14:15.135
THROW SOME BRICKS IN
'CAUSE THEY CHARGE BY WEIGHT.

14:15.135 --> 14:16.056
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.377
GETTING YOUR STUFF.

14:17.377 --> 14:18.458
OH GOOD.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.140
OH, I'D RIP
THAT LETTER UP.

14:20.140 --> 14:22.462
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
IT'S NOT EVEN REMOTELY
HEARTFELT OR POETIC.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.625
AND IT JUST MAKES HIM
SEEM WAY SMARTER THAN
HE IS, TRUST ME.

14:24.625 --> 14:25.946
HEY, GET MY
PURPLE SWEATER BACK.

14:25.946 --> 14:27.387
HOLD ON A SECOND,
MANDY.

14:27.387 --> 14:29.229
‐ YOU HAVE A PURPLE SWEATER?
‐ IT'S A VERY NICE PURPLE.

14:29.229 --> 14:30.591
DOES MANDY KNOW
YOU'RE GAY?

14:30.591 --> 14:31.792
‐ MICHELLE.
‐ IT MIGHT MAKE HER
FEEL BETTER.

14:31.792 --> 14:33.233
JUST GET THE SWEATER.

14:33.233 --> 14:35.155
MANDY, THERE'S
A PURPLE SWEATER?

14:35.155 --> 14:36.396
OH REALLY?

14:36.396 --> 14:37.558
SHE SAYS IT'S HERS.

14:37.558 --> 14:38.719
IT IS NOT HERS.

14:38.719 --> 14:40.480
‐ I BELIEVE HER.
‐ GREAT.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.922
OH NO NO.
I'M HERE. I'M HERE.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.163
I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE, MANDY.

14:43.163 --> 14:44.364
I'M NOT MY BROTHER.

14:44.364 --> 14:46.086
I'M GONNA CHECK OUT
THE REST OF THE TOWN.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.568
WHAT STORES HAVE YOU
NOT ALIENATED YET?

14:47.568 --> 14:49.089
NO, HOW BAD WAS
THE SEX, MANDY?

14:49.089 --> 14:50.811
‐ OH, COME ON.
‐ SHE HUNG UP
A MINUTE AGO.

14:50.811 --> 14:52.252
OH, THANK GOD.

22:12.492 --> 22:13.534
QUIT, FYI.

22:13.534 --> 22:15.896
I'M NOT QUITTING.

22:15.896 --> 22:17.177
I'M READY.

22:17.177 --> 22:18.378
GOOD.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.340
ARE MY SKATES
ON RIGHT?

22:20.340 --> 22:21.502
<i>( whistle blows )</i>

22:21.502 --> 22:22.903
ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

22:30.470 --> 22:31.471
<i>( whistle blows )</i>

22:36.276 --> 22:38.278
HOLD HER.
SHE'S RIGHT BEHIND US.

22:38.278 --> 22:39.479
HOLD HER.
HOLD HER.

22:39.479 --> 22:40.480
RIGHT HERE.

22:45.485 --> 22:46.887
( grunts )

22:50.290 --> 22:51.892
YOU OKAY, MEL?

22:51.892 --> 22:54.294
I'M FANTASTIC.

22:54.294 --> 22:56.496
WELL, GET BACK
OUT THERE.

23:15.596 --> 23:16.917
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

23:16.917 --> 23:18.759
‐ JUST OUT. WHY?
‐ WHY?!

23:18.759 --> 23:20.761
THIS IS NOT A TIME
TO GO JOHN GOTTI
ON ME, MELANIE.

23:20.761 --> 23:22.162
THIS IS A TIME
OF EMERGENCY.

23:22.162 --> 23:23.844
‐ WHAT'S THIS?
‐ GUESS.

23:23.844 --> 23:25.005
THE BRIDESMAID'S
DRESS.

23:25.005 --> 23:26.847
IT'S A TANK WITH WINGS
AND A RUMPUS ROOM.

23:26.847 --> 23:27.928
WHAT'S IT DOING HERE?

23:27.928 --> 23:29.049
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
IT'S SAFE.

23:29.049 --> 23:30.330
IF MY MOTHER FOUND IT,
SHE MIGHT CHABLIS‐UP

23:30.330 --> 23:31.612
AND TAKE
A KNIFE TO IT.

23:31.612 --> 23:32.853
THEN YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE TO WEAR IT.

23:32.853 --> 23:33.814
‐ DON'T JOKE.
‐ I WASN'T JOKING.

23:33.814 --> 23:35.616
‐ I HAVE TO WEAR IT.
‐ I KNOW.

23:35.616 --> 23:36.777
NOW LISTEN.

23:36.777 --> 23:38.779
WHY AREN'T YOU
ANSWERING YOUR PHONE?

23:38.779 --> 23:40.460
‐ MUST BE OFF?
‐ FLAKE CITY,

23:40.460 --> 23:42.182
‐ I WON'T HAVE IT!
‐ OKAY, SORRY.

23:42.182 --> 23:43.463
YOU CANNOT HAVE
YOUR PHONE OFF

23:43.463 --> 23:44.705
FROM NOW
UNTIL THE WEDDING.

23:44.705 --> 23:46.346
‐ IT'S CRISIS TIME, GET IT?
‐ GOT IT.

23:46.346 --> 23:49.029
FAYE MENDELSON HAS
GONE INTO A TOTAL
DEFENSIVE POSTURE.

23:49.029 --> 23:50.350
SHE MOVED THE PHOTO
SHOOT UP A WEEK

23:50.350 --> 23:51.872
TO KEEP MY MOTHER
OFF THE SCENT.

23:51.872 --> 23:52.833
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO DO THE PHOTO SHOOT

23:52.833 --> 23:54.074
THE DAY OF THE WEDDING?

23:54.074 --> 23:55.596
WHEN EVERYONE'S
ALREADY THERE, YES.

23:55.596 --> 23:56.837
BUT FAYE'S NOT
TAKING CHANCES.

23:56.837 --> 23:58.438
OH, SHE IS GOING
TO GREAT EXPENSE

23:58.438 --> 24:00.440
TO MAKE SURE MY MOTHER
DOESN'T SHOW UP.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.162
AND SHE'S BRINING
A TRAMPOLINE.

24:02.162 --> 24:03.163
WHY?

24:03.163 --> 24:04.605
I DON'T KNOW.

24:04.605 --> 24:05.766
YOU'LL COME WITH ME
TO THE PHOTO SHOOT?

24:05.766 --> 24:07.087
HELP WITH THE DRESS,
THE MAKEUP,

24:07.087 --> 24:08.328
MAYBE SUICIDE
ASSISTANCE?

24:08.328 --> 24:09.329
ABSOLUTELY.

24:09.329 --> 24:11.171
HI, EVERYONE.

24:11.171 --> 24:12.613
HEY.

24:12.613 --> 24:14.174
‐ HEY.
‐ HEY.

24:14.174 --> 24:16.617
<i>( cellphone ringing )</i>

24:18.619 --> 24:20.621
HELLO? MOM?

24:20.621 --> 24:22.623
OKAY, HOW DO YOU KNOW

24:22.623 --> 24:23.704
FAYE MENDELSON
IS GETTING A MASSAGE

24:23.704 --> 24:24.865
AND LEFT HER DOG
IN THE CAR?

24:24.865 --> 24:26.627
ARE YOU FOLLOWING HER?

24:26.627 --> 24:28.629
<i>WHAT DOES "KIND OF</i>
<i>FOLLOWING HER" MEAN?</i>

24:28.629 --> 24:30.631
<i>YOU'RE EITHER FOLLOWING HER</i>
<i>OR YOU'RE NOT.</i>

24:30.631 --> 24:31.632
<i>NO, MOM.</i>

24:33.794 --> 24:34.795
HEY.

24:37.758 --> 24:39.760
‐ HI, COZETTE.
‐ OH, WE'RE TALKING.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.602
‐ YEAH, SORRY.
‐ NO WORRIES.

24:41.602 --> 24:43.243
NO, SHE WILL
KNOW WHO IT IS

24:43.243 --> 24:44.765
IF SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO HER DOG.

24:44.765 --> 24:46.607
SHE WILL KNOW.

24:46.607 --> 24:48.609
I GET WHAT'S
GOING ON.

24:48.609 --> 24:50.010
WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:50.010 --> 24:52.773
GROUP DYNAMICS ARE
NATURALLY RESISTANT
TO ALTERATION.

24:52.773 --> 24:54.174
WHAT IS THAT,
LIKE PHYSICS?

24:54.174 --> 24:55.616
MADONNA.

24:55.616 --> 24:57.417
SO WHY DON'T YOU
SKATE FOR THE TEAM?

24:57.417 --> 24:58.939
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHY
YOU GAVE ME THE FLYER.

24:58.939 --> 25:00.420
MY BROTHER AND I
DO THE MUSIC.

25:00.420 --> 25:01.702
WHEN YOU SAW ME THE OTHER DAY,
WE WERE GETTING OUR

25:01.702 --> 25:02.783
SET LIST TOGETHER.

25:02.783 --> 25:03.864
THE DOG IS INNOCENT.

25:03.864 --> 25:04.785
HE'S AN INNOCENT PARTY.

25:04.785 --> 25:06.627
DO NOT TOUCH THE DOG!

25:06.627 --> 25:08.188
YOU NEED A NAME,
YOU KNOW.

25:08.188 --> 25:09.269
FOR WHAT?

25:09.269 --> 25:11.191
A SKATER NAME.
EVERYONE'S GOT A NAME.

25:11.191 --> 25:13.193
OH, YEAH.
I HAVEN'T REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

25:13.193 --> 25:14.635
WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
MY BROTHER AND ME

25:14.635 --> 25:16.156
NAMED HALF THE TEAM.
LEAVE IT TO US.

25:16.156 --> 25:17.758
SO YOU'RE WALKING
DOWN THE STREET

25:17.758 --> 25:19.079
AWAY FROM
FAYE MENDELSON'S CAR

25:19.079 --> 25:20.601
AND THE DOG
IS FINE.

25:20.601 --> 25:22.603
OKAY. GO HOME.
CHABLIS‐UP.

25:22.603 --> 25:23.764
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

25:23.764 --> 25:25.165
<i>( phone beeps )</i>

25:25.165 --> 25:27.608
WE SHOULD GET
DOWNSTAIRS.

25:27.608 --> 25:28.769
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

25:34.174 --> 25:35.776
I DON'T THINK YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE.

25:35.776 --> 25:37.337
YOUR PARENTS
ARE NORMAL.

25:37.337 --> 25:38.939
THEY DO NORMAL THINGS
AND EAT NORMAL FOOD.

25:38.939 --> 25:40.701
AND EVEN THOUGH YOUR
MOTHER COUNTS THE PEAS

25:40.701 --> 25:42.462
ON EVERYONE'S PLATE TO
MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS
THE SAME AMOUNT,

25:42.462 --> 25:44.705
I THINK THAT'S THOUGHTFUL.
MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN
WANDERING THE HOUSE

25:44.705 --> 25:45.946
AT NIGHT LIKE
LADY MACBETH.

25:45.946 --> 25:47.307
OH SHOOT,
I FORGOT MY SHOES.

25:47.307 --> 25:49.630
YOU DID NOT
FORGET YOUR SHOES.
I DROVE YOU OFF.

25:49.630 --> 25:51.351
I DROVE HER OFF
JUST LIKE MY MOTHER

25:51.351 --> 25:52.553
DRIVES EVERYONE OFF.

25:52.553 --> 25:54.034
"WE MOCK THE THINGS
WE ARE TO BE."

25:54.034 --> 25:55.355
YOU KNOW WHO SAID THAT?
MEL BROOKS.

25:55.355 --> 25:56.717
2,000‐YEAR‐OLD MAN.

25:56.717 --> 25:58.478
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW
WE MAKE FUN OF OUR PARENTS

25:58.478 --> 26:00.400
AND THEN WE GROW UP
AND TURN INTO OUR PARENTS.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.162
AND THAT LINE POPPED
INTO MY HEAD YESTERDAY

26:02.162 --> 26:04.404
SO I STARTED LOOKING
THROUGH OLD PHOTO ALBUMS
OF MY MOTHER

26:04.404 --> 26:06.246
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
EXACTLY WHEN HER CRAZY SET IN

26:06.246 --> 26:07.487
SO I CAN BE PREPARED.

26:07.487 --> 26:08.769
I THINK IT STARTED
AROUND COLLEGE.

26:08.769 --> 26:09.930
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I SAW HER DO THAT

26:09.930 --> 26:11.772
REALLY WILD‐EYED
THING SHE DOES.

26:11.772 --> 26:13.854
SO I GUESS I'VE GOT
ABOUT THREE TO FOUR YEARS

26:13.854 --> 26:14.935
BEFORE I GO
BARKING MAD

26:14.935 --> 26:16.176
WHICH IS GOOD.

26:16.176 --> 26:17.818
NOW I'M READY FOR IT.
I CAN PLAN AHEAD.

26:17.818 --> 26:19.620
YOU KNOW, HAVE A LOT OF
ROUNDED CORNERS IN MY HOUSE.

26:19.620 --> 26:20.941
WEAR SOFT, BOUNCY CLOTHING.

26:20.941 --> 26:22.342
STOCK UP ON TISSUE,
ICE CREAM,

26:22.342 --> 26:23.784
‐ VOODOO DOLLS.
‐ ARE YOU DUTCH?

26:23.784 --> 26:25.866
‐ WHAT?
‐ DUTCH. ARE YOU DUTCH?

26:25.866 --> 26:28.789
‐ I‐‐
‐ YOUR FACE REMINDS ME
OF A VERMEER.

26:28.789 --> 26:29.990
IT DOES?

26:29.990 --> 26:31.151
"THE MILKMAID."

26:31.151 --> 26:33.073
I DRINK MILK.

26:33.073 --> 26:35.636
Michelle:
<i>ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.</i>
<i>BUTTS TO THE BARRE.</i>

26:35.636 --> 26:38.398
WELL, I SHOULD
GET THIS OVER THERE.

26:38.398 --> 26:39.920
HEY.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.162
GENIUS IS OFTEN
TOUCHED WITH MADNESS.

26:42.162 --> 26:43.524
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUN.

26:43.524 --> 26:46.126
‐ TICK, TOCK.
‐ I GUESS SO.

26:48.609 --> 26:49.850
OW.

26:49.850 --> 26:51.171
COME ON, LET'S GO.
MOVE MOVE MOVE.

26:51.171 --> 26:52.773
UP UP UP.
COME ON.

26:52.773 --> 26:55.175
THERE'S NO ONE IN HERE
YOU CAN DATE.

26:55.175 --> 26:56.937
I JUST THOUGHT I'D COME
WATCH MY SISTER

26:56.937 --> 26:57.778
SHAPE YOUNG LIVES.

26:57.778 --> 26:58.859
I'M JUST
TEACHING A CLASS.

26:58.859 --> 27:00.621
YOU ARE JUST
TEACHING A CLASS.

27:00.621 --> 27:01.782
‐ STOP.
‐ WHAT?

27:01.782 --> 27:02.943
YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE BIT DOUCHEY.

27:02.943 --> 27:03.984
I'M NOT BEING
A LITTLE BIT DOUCHEY.

27:03.984 --> 27:04.985
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
IN A POSITION

27:04.985 --> 27:06.507
OF AUTHORITY BEFORE.
EXCEPT THAT YEAR

27:06.507 --> 27:08.108
YOU DRESSED UP LIKE
ANGIE DICKINSON
FOR HALLOWEEN.

27:08.108 --> 27:09.269
HA HA. GO AWAY.

27:09.269 --> 27:11.431
I'M NOT GONNA
DISRUPT ANYTHING.

27:11.431 --> 27:13.634
‐ SCOTTY.
‐ I'M JUST GONNA
SIT RIGHT HERE

27:13.634 --> 27:15.636
AND WATCH YOU TEACH.

27:15.636 --> 27:17.197
I THINK IT'LL
BE INTERESTING.

27:17.197 --> 27:18.679
AND POSSIBLY HILARIOUS.

27:20.561 --> 27:22.763
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
FIRST POSITION.

27:22.763 --> 27:24.765
<i>( piano playing )</i>

27:27.928 --> 27:30.771
<i>DEMI,</i> STRAIGHT.

27:30.771 --> 27:33.574
<i>DEMI,</i> STRAIGHT.

27:33.574 --> 27:34.775
<i>GRAND PLIE.</i>

27:40.781 --> 27:42.783
<i>NICE. BEAUTIFUL.</i>

27:42.783 --> 27:43.784
<i>NEXT GROUP.</i>

27:47.948 --> 27:50.591
<i>ALL RIGHT, FOUR TURNS</i>
<i>ARE NOT BETTER THAN THREE</i>
<i>IF YOU FALL, DUDE.</i>

27:58.198 --> 27:59.960
COZETTE, SO GOOD,
BUT I NEED THAT HOLD

27:59.960 --> 28:01.802
BEFORE YOU
FLOAT THROUGH.

28:01.802 --> 28:03.003
I'M SORRY?

28:03.003 --> 28:04.765
YOU HAVE TO HIT
THAT ARABESQUE STRONG.

28:04.765 --> 28:07.768
AND THEN SQUARE
EVERYTHING OFF.

28:07.768 --> 28:08.929
THEN LEADING
WITH THE CHIN,

28:08.929 --> 28:11.171
ARM UP AND THEN
FLOAT THROUGH, OKAY?

28:11.171 --> 28:12.172
AHH.

28:12.172 --> 28:14.575
LIKE THIS.

28:14.575 --> 28:15.776
YES. GREAT.

28:15.776 --> 28:17.177
PERFECT. NICE.

28:17.177 --> 28:18.779
POINTE SHOES ON,
EVERYONE.

28:22.583 --> 28:24.785
WOW, THAT COZETTE,
SHE'S VERY‐‐

28:24.785 --> 28:26.186
‐ INTENSE?
‐ AND WEIRD.

28:26.186 --> 28:27.508
I MEAN WEIRD
IN A GOOD WAY,

28:27.508 --> 28:29.109
‐ BUT WHO THE HELL IS SHE?
‐ BEATS ME.

28:29.109 --> 28:30.511
AND WHY DOES SHE BRING
THAT SKETCH ARTIST WITH HER

28:30.511 --> 28:32.032
‐ EVERYWHERE SHE GOES?
‐ THAT'S HER BROTHER.

28:32.032 --> 28:34.114
OH, OKAY. YEAH,
NOT ANY LESS WEIRD.

28:34.114 --> 28:35.796
WHO BRINGS THEIR BROTHER
WITH THEM EVERYWHERE THEY GO?

28:35.796 --> 28:37.758
OH, HEY, SCOTTY.
THIS IS MY BROTHER SCOTTY.

28:37.758 --> 28:39.960
NICE HOOFING.
MAKING MICHELLE LOOK
GOOD OUT THERE.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.362
THANK YOU FROM THE PRESIDENT
OF "I HAVE NO COORDINATION

28:42.362 --> 28:43.564
INCORPORATED."

28:43.564 --> 28:46.046
SO SERIOUSLY,
HOW IS SHE AS A TEACHER?

28:46.046 --> 28:47.808
‐ SHE'S GOOD.
‐ <i>REALLY?</i>

28:47.808 --> 28:49.570
ACCEPT THE ANSWER
AND GO SIT DOWN.

28:49.570 --> 28:50.811
I'M SORRY,
I HAVE TO SAY

28:50.811 --> 28:52.773
IT IS SO WEIRD
TO SEE YOU AS
A TEACHER.

28:52.773 --> 28:53.774
I KNOW, RIGHT?

28:53.774 --> 28:54.815
<i>THANKS, MATISSE.</i>

28:54.815 --> 28:55.856
YOU GUYS HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND,

28:55.856 --> 28:57.017
WHEN MICHELLE
WAS A KID,

28:57.017 --> 28:58.338
SHE HATED
HER BALLET TEACHER.

28:58.338 --> 28:59.580
OKAY, WE'RE IN
THE MIDDLE OF
A CLASS HERE.

28:59.580 --> 29:00.941
NO, IT WAS LIKE
A DEEP DEEP HATRED.

29:00.941 --> 29:02.342
AN OBSESSIVE HATRED.

29:02.342 --> 29:04.585
AND THEN ONE NIGHT
SHE SAW THIS MOVIE.

29:04.585 --> 29:07.948
AND IT HAD...
MARGARET O'BRIEN,

29:07.948 --> 29:09.349
‐ REMEMBER?
‐ NO.

29:09.349 --> 29:11.031
SO, MARGARET O'BRIEN
WAS THIS BALLET STUDENT

29:11.031 --> 29:13.193
AND SHE IDOLIZED
THIS OLD BALLERINA.

29:13.193 --> 29:15.876
SHE WASN'T OLD.
SHE WAS OLDER

29:15.876 --> 29:17.237
THAN MARGARET O'BRIEN.

29:17.237 --> 29:19.279
AND THEN ONE DAY,
THIS OTHER BALLERINA
COMES TO TOWN

29:19.279 --> 29:20.881
AND STEALS THE LEAD
IN "SWAN LAKE"

29:20.881 --> 29:22.803
FROM MARGARET O'BRIEN'S
BALLERINA.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.925
SO SHE DECIDES TO SABOTAGE
THE NEW BALLERINA

29:24.925 --> 29:26.246
BY TURNING OFF
THE STAGE LIGHTS,

29:26.246 --> 29:28.969
BUT SHE OPENS A TRAPDOOR
IN THE FLOOR BY MISTAKE,

29:28.969 --> 29:30.250
<i>AND THE BALLERINA</i>
<i>FALLS INTO IT.</i>

29:30.250 --> 29:31.371
OH MY GOD,
WHAT HAPPENED?

29:31.371 --> 29:32.933
PARALYZED, WHEELCHAIR.

29:32.933 --> 29:34.134
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

29:34.134 --> 29:35.576
TO YOU. TO MICHELLE,
IT WAS INSPIRATION.

29:35.576 --> 29:36.937
OKAY, SCOTTY.

29:36.937 --> 29:39.099
SO MICHELLE DECIDES TO
CUT A HOLE IN THE FLOOR

29:39.099 --> 29:40.581
OF HER BALLET CLASS

29:40.581 --> 29:41.862
SO THAT OLD LADY
VINSHTICK

29:41.862 --> 29:42.943
WOULD FALL IN AND
PARALYZE HERSELF.

29:42.943 --> 29:44.184
I DID NOT.

29:44.184 --> 29:45.786
SHE BREAKS IN
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

29:45.786 --> 29:48.188
AND TRIES TO CUT
A HOLE IN THE FLOOR WITH‐‐

29:48.188 --> 29:51.592
WITH SAFETY SCISSORS
AND A GRAPEFRUIT SPOON.

29:51.592 --> 29:52.873
IT DIDN'T GO
VERY WELL.

29:52.873 --> 29:54.194
WOW.

29:54.194 --> 29:55.315
<i>OKAY, SHOES BACK ON?</i>
<i>GREAT.</i>

30:00.961 --> 30:02.402
SO HOW MUCH LONGER
YOU GOT HERE?

30:02.402 --> 30:03.804
I'M THINKING DINNER.

30:03.804 --> 30:05.445
DON'T KNOW. CLASS,
SOME BOOKKEEPING.

30:05.445 --> 30:07.167
YOU MIGHT BE
ON YOUR OWN TONIGHT.

30:07.167 --> 30:08.929
OH.

30:08.929 --> 30:10.130

SONIC YOUTH SEGUEING

30:30.150 --> 30:32.152
LIL' WAYNE SEGUEING
INTO BRAD PAISLEY DID NOT.

30:32.152 --> 30:33.554
DID YOU KNOW
HE WAS COUNTRY?

30:33.554 --> 30:35.556
THE PAISLEY THING
THREW ME OFF.

30:35.556 --> 30:38.158

30:38.158 --> 30:40.000

‐ YEAH YOU.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.161
TRYING TO.

30:41.161 --> 30:42.402
THE NAME WILL HELP.

30:42.402 --> 30:43.724
JUST GOTTA
THINK OF ONE.

30:43.724 --> 30:46.206
‐ WE ALREADY DID THAT.
‐ YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

30:46.206 --> 30:47.407
BUT YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW ME.

30:47.407 --> 30:50.851
YO! CLEO‐SMACKTRA,
GET IN HERE.

30:52.372 --> 30:54.575
CLEO‐SMACKTRA?

30:54.575 --> 30:56.016
COOL.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.140
THAT BEAVER.
HE'S EVIL.

31:00.140 --> 31:01.542
THERE'S EVILNESS
IN THAT KID.

31:01.542 --> 31:03.303
AT LEAST I'M NOT LATE
TO CLASS TODAY. GOOD.

31:03.303 --> 31:05.706
THE HAND OF LUCIFER
HAS TOUCHED THAT CHILD.

31:05.706 --> 31:07.147
NO TIME FOR
THE DRESSING ROOM THOUGH.

31:07.147 --> 31:08.909
HE PLAYED US
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

31:08.909 --> 31:09.910
HOW DID WE
LET HIM DO THAT?

31:09.910 --> 31:11.151
HE CAUGHT US
AT A BAD TIME.

31:11.151 --> 31:12.392
I DIDN'T CALL YOU
DOO‐DOO HEAD.

31:12.392 --> 31:14.274
<i>I WOULD NEVER CALL YOU</i>
<i>DOO‐DOO HEAD.</i>

31:14.274 --> 31:15.475
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT FOR A SECOND

31:15.475 --> 31:16.677
YOU THOUGHT I WOULD
CALL YOU DOO‐DOO HEAD.

31:16.677 --> 31:18.158
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
HE WAS SAYING, OKAY?

31:18.158 --> 31:19.800
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.161
HE'S BAD. I MEAN,
HE'S JUST A BAD ONE.

31:21.161 --> 31:23.163
AND WE FELL FOR IT.
WHY DID WE FALL FOR IT?

31:23.163 --> 31:25.005
‐ WE'RE TIRED.
‐ I'M EXHAUSTED.

31:25.005 --> 31:27.568
CLASS IS AN HOUR.
YOU AND THE KIDS STAY
IN THE VICINITY, OKAY?

31:27.568 --> 31:29.770
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO BRING THEM
ALL IN WITH YOU.

31:29.770 --> 31:31.532
CARL, I CAN'T.
I HAVE CLASS.

31:31.532 --> 31:33.133
WELL, I'VE GOT
SOMETHING TOO.

31:33.133 --> 31:34.775
SOMETHING?
WHAT SOMETHING?

31:34.775 --> 31:36.136
YOU DON'T HAVE
WORK TODAY.

31:36.136 --> 31:37.377
I'M GOING TO
THE GYM.

31:37.377 --> 31:38.779
THE GYM.

31:38.779 --> 31:40.380
YEAH, IT'S BEEN,
LIKE, FOREVER.

31:40.380 --> 31:41.902
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO THE GYM.

31:41.902 --> 31:42.983
I AM GOING
TO THE GYM.

31:42.983 --> 31:44.665
‐ NO.
‐ YES.

31:44.665 --> 31:46.106
OKAY, FINE.
BUT I WON'T BE HERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

31:46.106 --> 31:47.828
I HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO MYSELF IN A WEEK!

31:47.828 --> 31:49.630
YOU KNEW THAT KIDS
WERE A COMMITMENT.

31:49.630 --> 31:51.151
THESE AREN'T
OUR KIDS.

31:51.151 --> 31:52.392
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

31:52.392 --> 31:53.554
CARL, PLEASE.

31:53.554 --> 31:55.556
FINE.
I'LL SKIP THE GYM.

31:55.556 --> 31:57.998
BUT IF I LOSE
DEFINITION IN
MY GLUTES,

31:57.998 --> 32:00.160
YOU'RE TO BLAME,
OKAY?

32:03.003 --> 32:04.565
CARL, PLEASE
DON'T BE MAD.

32:04.565 --> 32:06.727
LET'S START CLASS,
LOSERS.

32:06.727 --> 32:08.488
JUST NEED TO STRETCH
A LITTLE FIRST,

32:08.488 --> 32:10.170
‐ OKAY, JORDAN?
‐ ABSOLUTELY NOT.

32:10.170 --> 32:11.411
YOU THREE,
YOU'RE MY FIRST GROUP.

32:11.411 --> 32:13.974
WE'RE STARTING
WITH <i>PIROUETTES.</i>

32:13.974 --> 32:16.216

32:25.145 --> 32:27.548
TWO AND THEN YOU STOP.

32:27.548 --> 32:29.149
MARGARET,
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

32:29.149 --> 32:32.553
‐ 10.
‐ 10?

32:32.553 --> 32:34.995
I THOUGHT, WITH THAT
ATTITUDE OF YOURS,
YOU WERE SIX.

32:34.995 --> 32:37.518
YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW MANY I COULD
DO WHEN I WAS 10?

32:37.518 --> 32:38.679
LIKE A THOUSAND.

32:38.679 --> 32:40.721
<i>DO NOT LOOK WEAK,</i>
<i>MARGARET.</i>

32:40.721 --> 32:43.163
BARYSHNIKOV

32:43.163 --> 32:45.165
EVEN IN
"SEX AND THE CITY,"

32:45.165 --> 32:46.406
THE MAN NEVER
LOOKED WEAK!

32:46.406 --> 32:48.168
JORDAN!

32:48.168 --> 32:49.770
I HAVE HAD IT WITH
THIS ATTITUDE OF YOURS.

32:49.770 --> 32:51.171
YOUR RUDENESS.

32:51.171 --> 32:53.534
AND YOUR BARYSHNIKOV THIS
AND BARYSHNIKOV THAT.

32:53.534 --> 32:55.055

A TIME‐OUT, MISTER.

32:56.136 --> 32:57.698

32:57.698 --> 32:59.540

33:01.542 --> 33:03.143
OKAY, WE ARE
HERE TO LEARN

33:03.143 --> 33:04.985
AND TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME.

33:04.985 --> 33:07.147
THAT'S WHAT BALLET
IS ALL ABOUT.

33:07.147 --> 33:08.989
‐ <i>( cellphone rings )</i>
‐ NOW, I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO ANSWER THAT.

33:08.989 --> 33:10.871
OKAY? BECAUSE
I'VE GOT SCHOOL.

33:10.871 --> 33:12.633
AND A JOB.
AND THREE KIDS.

33:12.633 --> 33:14.995
AND THAT COULD BE NEWS
THAT ONE OF THEM JUST
SHOVED A DUMP TRUCK

33:14.995 --> 33:16.557

OKAY?

33:16.557 --> 33:18.158
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE
FIVE MINUTES.

33:18.158 --> 33:20.160
WE'RE ALL GOING TO
TAKE FIVE MINUTES HERE.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.563
AND WHEN I GET BACK,
I EXPECT TO SEE

33:22.563 --> 33:25.365
A BRAND‐NEW JORDAN.

34:48.168 --> 34:49.289
IT WENT BAD,
DIDN'T IT?

34:49.289 --> 34:50.891
OH YES, YES.
VERY BAD.

34:50.891 --> 34:53.173
‐ VERY BAD INDEED.

34:53.173 --> 34:55.255

34:55.255 --> 34:56.496
PUNCH FROM WHEN
MY MOTHER CAME

‐ AND THREW IT
ALL OVER US.
‐ OH MY GOD.

34:57.938 --> 34:59.379
WHERE DID YOUR MOTHER
GET PUNCH?

34:59.379 --> 35:01.942
OH, THERE ARE A VARIETY
OF PLACES TO GET PUNCH, MELANIE.

35:01.942 --> 35:03.544
RALPHS HAS PUNCH,

35:03.544 --> 35:05.225
AND VONS,
AND ALBERTSONS,

35:05.225 --> 35:07.307
YOUR LOCAL PHARMACY
STOCKS MANY PUNCH PRODUCTS

35:07.307 --> 35:10.270
TO THROW ON PEOPLE.
PUNCH IS VERY EASY
TO OBTAIN.

35:10.270 --> 35:13.153
GINNY, I AM SO SORRY.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.395
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
WHY I HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND.

35:15.395 --> 35:17.558
BUT I GOT CAUGHT UP
IN ALL THIS STUFF,

35:17.558 --> 35:19.319
AND I'M SUCKING AT SCHOOL

35:19.319 --> 35:22.162
AND MY DAD IS PUTTING
COLLEGE PAMPHLETS ON MY PILLOW,

35:22.162 --> 35:24.965

35:36.176 --> 35:38.859
AND IT MADE SOME
KIND OF STUPID SENSE.

35:38.859 --> 35:40.140
AND I'M JUST SO...

35:40.140 --> 35:42.342
SO SORRY.

HOW DID THIS
ENTER YOUR WORLD?

36:05.566 --> 36:07.087
<i>THAT NIGHT</i>
<i>AT THE OYSTER BAR,</i>

36:07.087 --> 36:09.209
WHEN I PULLED THE CHAIR

GODOT GOT YOU INTO THIS?

36:10.490 --> 36:11.612
<i>NOT GODOT.</i>

36:11.612 --> 36:13.173

YOU'RE RUINING EVERYTHING!

36:26.947 --> 36:28.869
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE
OR WHERE YOU'RE FROM,

OR WHY YOU KNOW FRENCH,
OR WHY YOU'RE SO CLOSE
WITH MITCH ALVARADO,

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE KEY
I GAVE YOU YESTERDAY?

37:12.753 --> 37:14.354
I DON'T KNOW.
MISPLACED IT.

37:14.354 --> 37:16.356
IS THERE LIKE A PARADISE
LOST AND FOUND SOMEWHERE?

37:16.356 --> 37:17.998
OH.

37:17.998 --> 37:19.479
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

37:19.479 --> 37:21.762
YOU'RE SUDDENLY ACTING
LIKE EVERY OTHER WOMAN

37:21.762 --> 37:23.363
MICHELLE?

37:23.363 --> 37:25.165

37:25.165 --> 37:26.366
‐ WHAT?
‐ WHEN I ASKED YOU
WHERE IT WAS,

37:26.366 --> 37:28.168
YOU TOLD ME TO MY FACE
THAT IT WAS LOST.

37:28.168 --> 37:29.770
IT WASN'T LOST.
YOU HAD IT THE WHOLE TIME.

37:29.770 --> 37:31.532
‐ WHO CARES?
‐ I DO. I WANTED MY UKULELE.

37:31.532 --> 37:33.774
‐ THAT WAS LIKE
20 YEARS AGO.
‐ IS THAT YOUR EXCUSE?

37:33.774 --> 37:35.776
OH JEEZ, I'M SORRY.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU
MISSED IT THAT MUCH

37:35.776 --> 37:37.177
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
JUST BOUGHT A NEW ONE.

37:37.177 --> 37:38.378
THEY'RE VERY HOT NOW.

37:38.378 --> 37:40.460
EDDIE VEDDER JUST DID
A WHOLE UKULELE ALBUM.

37:40.460 --> 37:42.182
THAT'S HOW OUT
OF IDEAS HE IS.

37:42.182 --> 37:43.504

FOR CHRISTMAS.
‐ YOU'RE UNDERMINING ME.

YOUR CRACKS, YOUR JOKES
IN FRONT OF THE GIRLS.

37:46.346 --> 37:48.428
I'M BEING FUNNY.
IT'S HUMOR.

37:48.428 --> 37:49.710
IT'S WHAT SETS US APART
FROM THE APES.

37:49.710 --> 37:51.071
THAT WHOLE
MARGARET O'BRIEN THING.

37:51.071 --> 37:52.913
‐ THAT WAS FUNNY?
‐ I CAN'T‐‐

37:52.913 --> 37:54.354
YOU BASICALLY TOLD THEM
TO CUT A HOLE IN THE FLOOR

37:54.354 --> 37:56.036
SO I'LL FALL THROUGH
AND PARALYZE MYSELF.

37:56.036 --> 37:58.438
I DIDN'T TELL THEM TO DO IT.
I TOLD THEM THAT YOU
WANTED TO DO IT

37:58.438 --> 38:00.480
TO YOUR TEACHER.
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A CUTE STORY.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.843
‐ YOU WERE PLANTING IDEAS.
‐ <i>I TOLD THEM THE PLOT</i>
<i>OF A MOVIE.</i>

38:02.843 --> 38:05.485
I DID NOT WRITE THE MOVIE.
HOW THE HELL AM I
THE BAD GUY IN THIS?

38:05.485 --> 38:06.767
THIS IS MY LIFE NOW, SCOTTY.

38:06.767 --> 38:08.689
THIS IS MY HOME.
THIS IS MY JOB.

38:08.689 --> 38:10.370
THOSE ARE MY STUDENTS.

38:10.370 --> 38:13.013
OH BOY. YOU HAVE SNAPPED
MANY MANY CAPS, MY FRIEND.

38:13.013 --> 38:14.134
I'M AN AUTHORITY
FIGURE NOW.

38:14.134 --> 38:15.495
AUTHORITY FIGURE?
COME ON.

38:15.495 --> 38:17.417
‐ THEY LOOK UP TO ME.
‐ <i>THEY'RE ISOLATED KIDS.</i>

38:17.417 --> 38:19.179
YOU'RE THIS STRANGE
EXOTIC CREATURE.

38:19.179 --> 38:20.861
YOU'RE A MERMAID.
YOU'RE TINKER BELL.

38:20.861 --> 38:23.023
SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE?
TO CRAP ALL OVER MY NEW LIFE?

38:23.023 --> 38:24.184
I WORKED HARD
FOR THIS LIFE.

38:24.184 --> 38:25.746
YOU GOT DRUNK
AND MARRIED A GUY.

38:25.746 --> 38:27.427
‐ <i>HARD WORK.</i>
‐ HEY!

38:27.427 --> 38:29.189
WHAT? I'VE DONE IT TOO.
NO JUDGMENTS.

38:29.189 --> 38:30.511
WELL, HE WAS A GREAT GUY.

38:30.511 --> 38:32.112
AND HIS MOTHER HAS BEEN
REALLY REALLY GOOD TO ME.

38:32.112 --> 38:33.433
‐ YOU'RE LIVING
IN A GUEST HOUSE.
‐ WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

38:33.433 --> 38:35.435
IT MEANS,
IT'S A ONE ROOM
GUEST HOUSE.

38:35.435 --> 38:38.759
‐ FOR A GUEST.
‐ OH, SO SQUARE FOOTAGE IS
THE MEASURE OF STABILITY NOW?

38:38.759 --> 38:40.360
WHAT'S YOUR SQUARE FOOTAGE,
SCOTTY, HUH?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.922
ENJOYING YOUR SIX FEET
OF MY COUCH?

38:41.922 --> 38:43.924
‐ MATT JOHNSON.
‐ WHAT?

38:43.924 --> 38:45.686
MATT JOHNSON. HE WAS
MY BEST FRIEND IN SCHOOL,

38:45.686 --> 38:47.367
YOU DATED HIM,
AND AS SOON AS
YOU GUYS BROKE UP

38:47.367 --> 38:48.769
HE WOULDN'T TALK
TO ME ANYMORE.

38:48.769 --> 38:49.930
WHAT ARE YOU
YAMMERING ABOUT?

38:49.930 --> 38:51.371
YOU SAID YOU NEVER
TOOK ANYTHING FROM ME?

38:51.371 --> 38:52.533
YOU TOOK MATT JOHNSON.

38:52.533 --> 38:54.174
I HAVE NO MEMORY
OF MATT JOHNSON.

38:54.174 --> 38:55.375
OH, COME ON, MICHELLE.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.377
MATT JOHNSON?
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

38:57.377 --> 38:59.179
THE TWO AMIGOS?

38:59.179 --> 39:01.782
DO YOU MEAN
ERIC JOHNSON?

39:01.782 --> 39:03.063
YES.
ERIC JOHNSON.

39:03.063 --> 39:04.184
‐ WOW.
‐ DOESN'T CHANGE
WHAT HAPPENED.

39:04.184 --> 39:05.185
HE WAS SO
IMPORTANT TO YOU

39:05.185 --> 39:06.426
YOU COULDN'T
REMEMBER HIS NAME.

39:06.426 --> 39:07.548
PERHAPS I BLACKED IT OUT.
TOO MUCH TRAUMA.

39:07.548 --> 39:09.510
JUST OWN UP TO IT,
SCOTTY.

39:09.510 --> 39:11.151
‐ TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY.
‐ <i>WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO</i>
<i>WITH‐‐</i>

39:11.151 --> 39:13.233
YOU NEVER TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING.

39:13.233 --> 39:14.995
OH, SAYS THE GIRL WHO SET
EVERY FLOAT ON FIRE

39:14.995 --> 39:16.356
AT THE FOURTH OF JULY PARADE
WITH A CIGARETTE

39:16.356 --> 39:17.838
AND BLAMED IT
ON RAP MUSIC.

39:17.838 --> 39:19.560
WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE ME
GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL?

39:19.560 --> 39:21.361
‐ YOU DID GRADUATE.
‐ <i>NO.</i>

39:21.361 --> 39:23.083
‐ I WAS THERE.
‐ THAT WAS THE CEREMONY.

39:23.083 --> 39:24.605
I DIDN'T HAVE THE CREDITS
TO GET THE DIPLOMA.

39:24.605 --> 39:25.766
OH, BUMMER.

39:25.766 --> 39:27.447
YOU SHOULD HAVE
MADE ME GRADUATE.

39:27.447 --> 39:29.449
IT WAS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO MAKE SURE I WAS PREPARED
FOR LIFE.

39:29.449 --> 39:30.931
‐ WHY ME?
‐ YOU'RE MY BIG BROTHER.

39:30.931 --> 39:32.372
BY A YEAR!

39:32.372 --> 39:33.934
ALL I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO
WAS MAKE SURE YOU HAD BEER.

39:33.934 --> 39:35.536
WHY IS THIS FUNNY?
WHY ARE YOU MAKING
THIS FUNNY?

39:35.536 --> 39:38.178
BECAUSE ALL I WANTED
WAS A KEY.

39:38.178 --> 39:39.379
THAT'S ALL.

39:39.379 --> 39:40.941
AND SUDDENLY
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT

39:40.941 --> 39:42.783
AND YOU SAID UKULELE
LIKE 60 TIMES

39:42.783 --> 39:45.265
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY WE'RE HAVING
THIS ARGUMENT.

39:45.265 --> 39:47.467
DON'T DO THAT.
THAT IS SO MOM.

39:47.467 --> 39:49.309
SHE STARTS STUFF, AND THEN
WHILE YOU'RE STANDING THERE

39:49.309 --> 39:51.071
YELLING AND SCREAMING
AND PULLING YOUR HAIR OUT,

39:51.071 --> 39:52.753
SHE SAYS "I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS ARGUMENT"

39:52.753 --> 39:54.835
WHEN SHE KNOWS DAMN WELL
WHY YOU'RE HAVING THE ARGUMENT.

39:54.835 --> 39:56.837
SHE'S THE ONE WHO STARTED
THIS ARGUMENT IN THE FIRST
PLACE.

39:56.837 --> 39:58.679
HOW DID WE SUDDENLY
GET TO MOM?

39:58.679 --> 40:00.320
‐ YOU BROUGHT HER UP.
‐ I DID NOT BRING HER UP.

40:00.320 --> 40:01.762
WELL, BY BEING LIKE HER,
YOU BROUGHT HER UP.

40:01.762 --> 40:03.083
YOU DON'T EVEN
DEAL WITH MOM.

40:03.083 --> 40:04.164
I DEAL WITH MOM.

40:04.164 --> 40:05.325
MOM NEEDS MONEY,
I DEAL WITH IT.

40:05.325 --> 40:07.167
MOM NEEDS TO MOVE,
I DEAL WITH IT.

40:07.167 --> 40:09.169
MOM NEEDS HELP HIDING OUT
FROM THE JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES,

40:09.169 --> 40:10.531
I DEAL WITH IT!

40:10.531 --> 40:11.772
WHY WAS MOM HIDING OUT
FROM THE JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES?

40:11.772 --> 40:13.333
IT'S A LONG STORY
AND THEY'RE A VERY

40:13.333 --> 40:14.855
NON‐VIOLENT ORGANIZATION
SO IT TAKES A LOT

40:14.855 --> 40:16.256
TO GET THEM TO THE POINT

40:16.256 --> 40:17.337
WHERE THEY ARE SOMEONE
YOU HAVE TO HIDE OUT FROM.

40:17.337 --> 40:18.779
WELL, THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.

40:18.779 --> 40:20.861
I WASHED MY HANDS
OF ALL THAT A LONG TIME AGO.

40:20.861 --> 40:22.342
YES, I KNOW.
HOW LONG'S IT BEEN

40:22.342 --> 40:24.545
‐ SINCE YOU TALKED TO MOM?
‐ 12 GLORIOUS FUN‐FILLED YEARS.

40:24.545 --> 40:26.346
OH, VERY MATURE,
BY THE WAY.

40:26.346 --> 40:27.708
NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED.

40:27.708 --> 40:29.510
YOUR ADDRESS,
YOU GO TO A JOB
EVERY DAY,

40:29.510 --> 40:31.311
‐ BUT NOT MUCH ELSE.
‐ YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

40:31.311 --> 40:33.914
YEAH, IT TOOK ME WAY LONGER
TO FIGURE THINGS OUT
THAN IT SHOULD HAVE,

40:33.914 --> 40:35.315
BUT LOOK AT THE ROAD MAP
I HAD TO FOLLOW.

40:35.315 --> 40:37.518
THE BIRDS ATE ALL
THOSE BREADCRUMBS,
HANSEL.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.760
AND BOY, DO I NOT
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
ALL THE STUFF

40:39.760 --> 40:41.762
YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH
WITH THAT CRAZY WOMAN.

40:41.762 --> 40:44.765
BECAUSE I'VE DEALT WITH
MORE THAN A LIFETIME'S
WORTH OF CRAP FROM HER.

40:44.765 --> 40:46.607
<i>HER OBSESSION WITH</i>
<i>HER FACE AND HER LOOKS,</i>

40:46.607 --> 40:47.728
<i>AND MY FACE</i>
<i>AND MY LOOKS.</i>

40:47.728 --> 40:49.089
AND HER COMPLETELY
FICTIONAL TAKE

40:49.089 --> 40:50.611
ON WHAT OUR FAMILY WAS.

40:50.611 --> 40:53.173
AND IF YOU CHOOSE TO CONTINUE
HAVING NEGATIVE INFLUENCES

40:53.173 --> 40:54.775
<i>IN YOUR LIFE,</i>
<i>THEN YOU HAVE TO</i>
<i>PREPARE YOURSELF</i>

40:54.775 --> 40:56.336
<i>FOR THE CONSEQUENCES.</i>

40:56.336 --> 40:58.178
YOU KNOW WHO TOLD ME THAT?
FANNY, MY MOTHER‐IN‐LAW.

40:58.178 --> 41:00.020
SHE TOLD ME THAT YOU MAKE
YOUR OWN FAMILY.

41:00.020 --> 41:01.341
YOU MAKE YOUR OWN DESTINY.

41:01.341 --> 41:02.943
AND THERE IS NOTHING
YOU CANNOT CHANGE

41:02.943 --> 41:04.184
IF YOU ARE COMPLETELY
COMMITTED TO IT.

41:04.184 --> 41:05.345
AND I AM.

41:05.345 --> 41:07.187
I AM COMPLETELY
COMMITTED TO IT.

41:07.187 --> 41:09.189
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

41:09.189 --> 41:11.912
THE ADDRESS HAS CHANGED
AND MY LIFE HAS CHANGED.

41:11.912 --> 41:13.914
‐ FINE.
‐ I CAN DO THIS.
