00:14.625 --> 00:15.625
Come on!

00:16.208 --> 00:20.375
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-The party's just begun</i>

00:20.458 --> 00:23.916
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-Maths is so much fun</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:24.833
All right!

00:24.916 --> 00:27.041
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-Everyone</i>

00:27.125 --> 00:29.291
<i>-Party!</i>
<i>-Maths is fun</i>

00:29.375 --> 00:30.625
<i>We're the babies</i>

00:30.708 --> 00:32.083
<i>You're the big kids</i>

00:32.166 --> 00:35.416
<i>Teach us all the maths you know</i>
<i>One, two, three, let's go</i>

00:35.500 --> 00:36.333
<i>Zu ba!</i>

00:36.416 --> 00:37.750
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:37.833 --> 00:39.833
<i>The party's just begun</i>

00:39.916 --> 00:45.208
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-This party's number one!</i>

00:45.291 --> 00:46.791
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:55.041 --> 00:57.916
<i>Lulu is playing by herself today.</i>

00:58.708 --> 01:02.833
I'm not by myself. I'm playing with Raffe.

01:02.916 --> 01:06.291
And we're playing with my dollhouse. See?

01:07.000 --> 01:13.083
That's the bedroom, and this is the bed.

01:13.791 --> 01:20.791
And this is the kitchen
where we eat yummy noodles.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.708
I know, Raffe. It's a nice house.

01:28.416 --> 01:30.958
What did you say? Uh-huh…

01:31.541 --> 01:32.625
Uh-huh…

01:33.416 --> 01:36.041
You want to go inside?

01:36.750 --> 01:37.750
Okay.

01:45.083 --> 01:46.583
Oh no!

01:46.666 --> 01:49.875
You don't fit, Raffe!

01:50.458 --> 01:53.708
I'm going to fix this right now!

01:54.541 --> 01:55.500
Let's go!

01:56.541 --> 01:59.041
-Nice music!
-Hey!

01:59.125 --> 02:00.916
Raffe needs a house!

02:02.833 --> 02:04.458
Yeah, Raffe wants a house.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.833
A house?

02:05.916 --> 02:10.875
Yes. Raffe wants his own house.
Can we make him one?

02:10.958 --> 02:13.500
-Yeah, of course we can!
-Sure!

02:13.583 --> 02:16.541
Well, what kind of house does Raffe want?

02:17.125 --> 02:18.708
A nice house?

02:18.791 --> 02:21.291
Yeah, but what should it look like?

02:21.375 --> 02:24.541
It should look like a house.

02:26.416 --> 02:30.666
We could start
by drawing a picture of a house.

02:31.625 --> 02:35.375
But what shape
does Raffe want his house to be?

02:38.958 --> 02:40.583
Oh no!

02:40.666 --> 02:44.166
I forgot to teach Raffe about shapes!

02:44.250 --> 02:48.166
Well, don't worry, Lulu.
We could all teach Raffe.

02:48.250 --> 02:51.291
-Yeah, let's shape it!
-Yeah!

02:51.375 --> 02:58.375
Okay, listen to this song, Raffe,
and you'll learn about shapes.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.291
Bye-bye! Shape it!

03:03.375 --> 03:04.916
Let's teach Raffe!

03:05.000 --> 03:07.125
<i>Shape it, shape it, shape it</i>

03:08.166 --> 03:10.541
<i>No corners, round and smooth</i>

03:10.625 --> 03:13.083
<i>That's a circle, let's all move</i>

03:13.166 --> 03:16.208
<i>Three straight sides with three angles</i>

03:16.291 --> 03:19.041
<i>-One, two, three</i>
<i>-A triangle</i>

03:19.125 --> 03:21.875
<i>Four straight sides, all equal there</i>

03:21.958 --> 03:24.750
<i>Let's all jump into a square</i>

03:24.833 --> 03:27.500
<i>Four sides, all right angles</i>

03:27.583 --> 03:30.208
<i>Two sides longer, a rectangle</i>

03:30.291 --> 03:35.791
<i>Triangle, circle, that's a square</i>
<i>Shape it, shape it, everywhere</i>

03:36.458 --> 03:38.750
<i>Eight sides, what's going on?</i>

03:38.833 --> 03:41.625
<i>Shape it, shape it, an octagon</i>

03:41.708 --> 03:47.291
<i>Triangle, circle, that's a square</i>
<i>Shape it, shape it, everywhere</i>

03:47.375 --> 03:54.000
<i>We've done great, we've gone far</i>
<i>Shape it, shape it, we earned a star</i>

03:56.250 --> 03:58.375
Thank you, Stickety Bot!

03:59.958 --> 04:02.375
Okay, Raffe, what do you think?

04:06.291 --> 04:10.333
Raffe likes triangles and squares.

04:11.291 --> 04:15.375
Great! Let's draw them. Okay…

04:18.500 --> 04:19.833
Here's a triangle!

04:20.583 --> 04:22.458
-That's nice, Franny.
-Thanks.

04:22.541 --> 04:26.041
But, you know,
Raffe also likes squares. Yeah.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.375
Now, let's see.

04:29.166 --> 04:30.958
Drawing a square.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.458
Good square, Kip.

04:33.541 --> 04:34.875
Thanks, Bailey.

04:34.958 --> 04:38.833
But which shape is better
for a house, Raffe?

04:44.791 --> 04:51.125
Raffe wants to go inside the picture
to see which is better.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.375
Inside? But how?

04:54.875 --> 04:57.125
We can use our imaginations!

04:57.208 --> 04:59.541
-Oh, yes!
-Yeah!

04:59.625 --> 05:01.208
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

05:02.458 --> 05:07.000
Imagine, imagine, imagine, imagine.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.083
Imagine.

05:15.166 --> 05:18.291
-Wow, cool!
-Wow!

05:18.375 --> 05:19.208
<i>Dà.</i>

05:19.791 --> 05:23.208
That's right, Tilly.
The shapes are "big" now.

05:23.291 --> 05:24.125
<i>Dà!</i>

05:24.208 --> 05:26.625
Yeah, so Raffe can fit in them.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.166
This is a triangle house.

05:30.250 --> 05:36.041
As you can see, it's very nice,
because it has three sides.

05:37.541 --> 05:40.791
One, two, three.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.250
See, Raffe?

05:43.875 --> 05:49.958
Yeah, but what's better than three?
Four! Yeah, a square has four equal sides.

05:51.541 --> 05:56.375
One, two, three, four!

05:57.583 --> 05:59.291
Right, Raffe.

05:59.791 --> 06:03.625
So, which shape does Raffe pick
for his new house?

06:11.875 --> 06:14.125
Raffe is sad!

06:15.166 --> 06:19.958
-He is?
-Yes! Just look at him!

06:20.041 --> 06:23.875
Oh yeah, that's a sad face, I think.

06:23.958 --> 06:26.125
Why is he sad, Lulu?

06:26.208 --> 06:32.250
Well, he doesn't know which house to pick.
These shapes don't look like a house.

06:32.916 --> 06:34.875
This is a tricky problem.

06:34.958 --> 06:40.000
Yeah. Hey! I know who could help us
with shapes. Maths Molly.

06:41.166 --> 06:43.333
Maths Molly!

06:48.166 --> 06:52.375
-Over that way! Let's go!
-Come on! Let's catch her!

06:52.458 --> 06:55.666
Okay. You stay here, Raffe.

06:55.750 --> 06:59.916
I'll go and learn
how to make the best house ever.

07:01.875 --> 07:02.708
Bye-bye.

07:03.208 --> 07:06.375
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

07:06.458 --> 07:08.583
We need you, big kids.

07:10.666 --> 07:14.833
That shape has-- one, two, three,

07:14.916 --> 07:17.041
four-- four sides.

07:17.125 --> 07:20.708
And all four sides and corners are equal.

07:20.791 --> 07:22.041
What is it?

07:23.666 --> 07:25.041
<i>A square.</i>

07:29.166 --> 07:31.875
That has-- one, two,

07:31.958 --> 07:33.500
three-- three sides.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.333
What's that one?

07:36.916 --> 07:38.833
<i>A triangle.</i>

07:38.916 --> 07:39.875
Right!

07:47.500 --> 07:50.000
Maths Molly put the triangle

07:50.083 --> 07:52.125
on top of the square!

07:52.708 --> 07:54.083
Can you do that?

07:54.166 --> 07:57.708
<i>Babies, you can combine shapes</i>
<i>to make new shapes.</i>

07:59.166 --> 08:02.750
You can put shapes together
to make a whole new thing?

08:02.833 --> 08:05.958
That is so cool!

08:08.250 --> 08:10.875
It looks just like a house now.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.500
Perfect for Raffe.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.666
Can we combine even more shapes?

08:23.750 --> 08:26.041
Those squares made a window.

08:26.125 --> 08:30.041
Raffe's house will be so nice! Hooray!

08:31.000 --> 08:33.375
Let's have a…

08:33.458 --> 08:35.875
Maths Party!

08:35.958 --> 08:37.375
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

08:37.458 --> 08:38.875
<i>We did maths</i>

08:38.958 --> 08:41.041
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

08:41.958 --> 08:44.875
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

08:44.958 --> 08:48.333
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

08:48.416 --> 08:49.250
Yeah!

08:49.333 --> 08:50.958
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

08:51.041 --> 08:52.375
<i>We did maths</i>

08:52.458 --> 08:54.666
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

08:55.375 --> 08:58.041
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

08:58.125 --> 09:02.875
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

09:02.958 --> 09:05.500
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

09:06.083 --> 09:08.583
<i>We love maths!</i>

09:09.833 --> 09:11.250
Raffe!

09:11.875 --> 09:16.458
We learned how to make you a house
with lots of shapes. See?

09:16.541 --> 09:20.291
And we can make it even better.

09:21.750 --> 09:28.083
Here's a rectangle for the door!

09:28.166 --> 09:32.041
-That's a great rectangle.
-Wow, cool rectangle, Franny.

09:38.375 --> 09:39.875
<i>Tàiyáng.</i>

09:40.375 --> 09:41.625
"The sun"?

09:45.750 --> 09:49.833
Wow, Tilly!
You drew a yellow circle for the sun!

09:50.541 --> 09:53.458
Hey, Lulu, does Raffe like his house?

09:53.541 --> 09:54.958
-Like it?
-Yeah.

09:55.041 --> 09:57.250
-Just look at him.
-Okay.

09:58.791 --> 10:01.916
-I think he likes it?
-No.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.708
-He loves it!
-Yay!

10:06.833 --> 10:12.291
Raffe's house makes me so happy
that I want to dance!

10:12.375 --> 10:14.500
-Dance?
-To a happy place?

10:14.583 --> 10:17.041
-Let's do it!
-Let's go!

10:17.125 --> 10:20.916
<i>When you want to cheer up</i>
<i>'Cause you feel a little down</i>

10:21.000 --> 10:24.333
<i>It's a whole lot of fun</i>
<i>To start dancing around</i>

10:24.416 --> 10:27.458
<i>Let your feet take you for a real fun ride</i>

10:27.541 --> 10:30.500
<i>Hop a little</i>
<i>Jump a little, go for a slide</i>

10:30.583 --> 10:33.208
<i>And in no time at all</i>

10:33.708 --> 10:36.250
<i>You'll be having a ball</i>

10:36.333 --> 10:39.291
<i>We can dance, dance, dance</i>
<i>To a happy place</i>

10:39.375 --> 10:42.750
<i>Put a big, big smile on your happy face</i>

10:42.833 --> 10:45.500
<i>Dance, dance, dance to a happy place</i>

10:45.583 --> 10:47.375
<i>When we're dancing together</i>

10:47.458 --> 10:49.208
<i>We feel a lot better</i>

10:49.291 --> 10:51.208
<i>-Get snappy</i>
<i>-And get clappy</i>

10:52.291 --> 10:55.333
<i>Right away you're going to feel happy</i>

10:55.416 --> 10:58.125
<i>Dance, dance, dance to a happy place</i>

10:58.208 --> 11:01.333
<i>Put a big, big smile on your happy face</i>

11:01.416 --> 11:04.458
<i>Dance, dance, dance to a happy place</i>

11:04.541 --> 11:07.333
<i>Dance to a happy place</i>

11:09.083 --> 11:12.375
Now you have your very own house.

11:12.458 --> 11:17.250
We can use our imagination
and go there any time.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.666
-Yay!
-A house for Raffe!

11:19.750 --> 11:23.958
-Hey, let's throw Raffe a house party!
-Yeah!

11:24.583 --> 11:26.416
Hit it, Party-in-a-box!

11:27.208 --> 11:28.541
Yeah!

11:37.208 --> 11:38.583
House party!

11:40.875 --> 11:43.833
Big kids, thank you for helping.

11:43.916 --> 11:47.291
Raffe wants to give you a kissie.

11:52.750 --> 11:53.833
Bye-bye-bye!

12:01.916 --> 12:05.500
<i>The babies are playing</i>
<i>before it's time to get ready for bed.</i>

12:09.750 --> 12:12.125
I'm dancing with Bibibear.

12:16.791 --> 12:21.625
I'm making music.
I call this song "My Beddy-Bye Jam."

12:26.375 --> 12:29.458
I'm playing with Raffe.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.583
I know, Raffe. Kippie's music is so loud!

12:34.666 --> 12:40.291
Zoom! I'm flying in the sky! Zoom!

12:42.125 --> 12:43.875
What are you doing, Tilly?

12:43.958 --> 12:45.583
<i>Yuèliàng.</i>

12:45.666 --> 12:46.666
"The moon"?

12:47.375 --> 12:53.708
Oh yeah. The moon is very pretty tonight.
It's like a big bright circle.

12:54.291 --> 12:56.000
<i>Wn'ān.</i>

12:56.750 --> 13:00.666
Well, do you want
to say "good night" to the moon?

13:05.541 --> 13:08.625
You want to go to the moon
and say good night?

13:08.708 --> 13:12.500
Hey, Tilly. You can use my rocket ship.

13:13.333 --> 13:16.166
-Yeah!
-But it's almost time for sleep.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.291
Uh-oh.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.541
Well, let's ask the big kids

13:19.625 --> 13:23.333
if we can play one more game
before bedtime.

13:24.291 --> 13:26.500
<i>Pretty please with a cherry on top</i>

13:26.583 --> 13:27.875
<i>And a kiss, kiss, kiss</i>

13:27.958 --> 13:29.250
<i>And a hop, hop, hop</i>

13:29.333 --> 13:34.833
<i>And a happy dance from east to west</i>
<i>We hope that you'll say yes, yes, yes</i>

13:34.916 --> 13:36.666
<i>Please, please, please</i>

13:37.458 --> 13:39.375
<i>Please, please, please</i>

13:40.208 --> 13:42.041
<i>Please, please, please</i>

13:42.750 --> 13:45.291
<i>Please, oh, please, say yes, yes, yes</i>

13:45.375 --> 13:46.208
Yeah!

13:46.291 --> 13:49.458
Can we please play one more game
before bed?

13:49.958 --> 13:51.083
<i>Yes.</i>

13:54.500 --> 13:57.083
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh! You told us yes</i>

13:57.166 --> 13:59.666
<i>Big kids, you're the best, best, best</i>

13:59.750 --> 14:02.250
<i>We have some words we want to say</i>

14:02.333 --> 14:04.916
<i>Before we jump and hop away</i>

14:05.000 --> 14:06.958
<i>Thanks, thanks, thanks</i>

14:07.666 --> 14:09.625
<i>Thanks, thanks, thanks</i>

14:10.458 --> 14:12.291
<i>Thanks, thanks, thanks</i>

14:13.166 --> 14:18.458
<i>Thanks for saying yes, yes, yes</i>
<i>Thanks for saying yes, yes, yes!</i>

14:18.541 --> 14:20.458
Thank you!

14:21.833 --> 14:24.791
I'll give you another kiss right here.

14:26.583 --> 14:29.375
-Let's go, Lulu. Let's go.
-Okay.

14:37.375 --> 14:41.750
Astronauts Bailey and Tilly
are ready to go to the moon!

14:46.916 --> 14:48.708
Using our imaginations.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.416
And so is--

14:52.500 --> 14:54.791
Captain Lulu!

14:55.625 --> 14:57.750
Lulu, I'm the captain.

14:58.375 --> 15:02.375
No. Lulu the Captain this time. Please!

15:02.458 --> 15:06.166
Okay, Lulu. You get a turn.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.208
-Really? Thank you!
-Yeah.

15:08.291 --> 15:09.500
Thank you!

15:10.666 --> 15:13.333
-Oh, Kippie, thank you.
-Yeah.

15:17.916 --> 15:20.375
This button. Beep. Now this button. Boop.

15:20.458 --> 15:23.708
Now I turn this thing here.
And now this button. Boop.

15:23.791 --> 15:24.750
-Okay.
-Beep!

15:26.583 --> 15:29.666
Astronauts, are you ready for blast off?

15:32.208 --> 15:33.500
Ready!

15:33.583 --> 15:35.500
We're ready too!

15:36.875 --> 15:40.666
Okay. Begin countdown. From five…

15:42.250 --> 15:44.541
Big kids, will you help us?

15:44.625 --> 15:45.666
<i>Yes.</i>

15:47.208 --> 15:48.666
Five,

15:48.750 --> 15:50.041
four,

15:50.125 --> 15:51.291
three,

15:51.375 --> 15:52.625
two,

15:52.708 --> 15:54.041
one!

15:54.125 --> 15:57.541
Blast off!

16:02.250 --> 16:03.625
There they go.

16:08.875 --> 16:12.500
Space is beautiful.

16:15.416 --> 16:17.791
Now, let's find the moon.

16:19.750 --> 16:20.875
Where is it?

16:26.875 --> 16:31.916
Remember, astronauts,
a full moon looks like a circle.

16:33.625 --> 16:39.083
A really, really big circle.
Can you see it, Astronaut Bailey?

16:43.791 --> 16:47.208
We're looking for it now, Mission Control.

16:48.375 --> 16:55.375
Lulu in space!

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
Well, Tilly and I are looking for it.
Lulu's kind of just floating.

17:06.916 --> 17:08.833
Look at me.

17:08.916 --> 17:12.208
Loop the Lulu!

17:16.250 --> 17:18.208
Those are stars, Tilly.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.708
<i>Yuèliàng!</i>

17:21.333 --> 17:24.041
No. I don't see the moon yet.

17:25.208 --> 17:29.416
Captain Lulu?
Do you see a big circle anywhere?

17:29.500 --> 17:33.041
No. Only stars.

17:34.208 --> 17:36.708
Sparkly stars.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.500
<i>Yuèliàng!</i>

17:43.583 --> 17:46.875
Yes! There it is! Let's go!

17:49.625 --> 17:54.458
I'm coming! Wait for me!

17:57.208 --> 17:58.708
The moon!

17:58.791 --> 18:00.208
<i>Yuèliàng!</i>

18:01.708 --> 18:03.708
It's a big circle.

18:06.708 --> 18:07.708
Bailey?

18:08.458 --> 18:10.083
That's not a circle.

18:11.125 --> 18:12.541
You're right, Lulu.

18:13.041 --> 18:17.458
It's round like a circle,
but it's not flat like a circle.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.708
Well, maybe it's not the moon.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.791
Playroom, we have a problem.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.041
I think it's a shape problem.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.125
A shape problem?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.416
Shapes are maths…

18:36.500 --> 18:38.750
Astronauts, you should call…

18:39.583 --> 18:42.458
Maths Molly!

18:47.541 --> 18:52.916
-Maths Molly's in space!
-Let's follow her!

18:54.250 --> 18:55.083
Come on.

18:56.916 --> 19:00.000
<i>The babies are going</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

19:00.083 --> 19:03.125
-And we need your help.
-Yeah.

19:07.750 --> 19:11.125
That's what a full moon looks like
from far away.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.416
What's that shape, big kids?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.750
<i>A circle.</i>

19:19.208 --> 19:23.333
-Circles are round and flat.
-Yeah.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.250
Wow!

19:29.833 --> 19:32.416
-It's not flat any more!
-Yeah!

19:32.500 --> 19:35.500
And now it looks like the moon up close.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.166
What shape is that, big kids?

19:41.958 --> 19:43.625
<i>A sphere.</i>

19:44.583 --> 19:46.333
What's a sphere?

19:46.416 --> 19:52.166
<i>A sphere is a three-dimensional shape,</i>
<i>like a circle that you fill up with air.</i>

19:53.791 --> 19:56.125
That's just like my bouncy ball.

19:56.208 --> 19:59.958
Yeah. I wonder
what other shapes you could fill up.

20:03.208 --> 20:06.916
I know that shape. Big kids, do you know?

20:10.791 --> 20:12.500
<i>A square.</i>

20:14.833 --> 20:18.541
Okay. Fill it up, Maths Molly!

20:27.208 --> 20:28.708
What's that called?

20:31.791 --> 20:33.208
<i>A cube.</i>

20:34.291 --> 20:40.416
Like our blocks.
They're not squares. They're cubes.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.208
Yeah! And the moon isn't a circle.

20:43.291 --> 20:45.041
-It's a sphere!
-Yeah!

20:45.125 --> 20:50.250
-Three-dimensional shapes are amazing!
-Yeah!

20:50.333 --> 20:54.625
We learned more about shapes,
so we get to have a…

20:55.208 --> 20:58.750
Maths Party!

20:59.250 --> 21:00.666
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

21:00.750 --> 21:02.166
<i>We did math</i>s

21:02.250 --> 21:04.333
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

21:05.250 --> 21:08.166
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

21:08.250 --> 21:11.625
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

21:11.708 --> 21:12.541
Yeah!

21:12.625 --> 21:14.250
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

21:14.333 --> 21:15.666
<i>We did maths</i>

21:15.750 --> 21:18.000
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

21:18.666 --> 21:21.333
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

21:21.416 --> 21:26.166
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

21:26.250 --> 21:28.791
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

21:29.375 --> 21:31.875
<i>We love maths!</i>

21:39.083 --> 21:43.166
There's the moon, Tilly.
It's a great big sphere.

21:43.666 --> 21:46.125
Now you can say good night to it.

21:50.791 --> 21:52.750
<i>Wn'ān.</i>

21:53.791 --> 21:56.458
That's "good night" in Mandarin.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.083
This is Mission Control.

21:59.166 --> 22:02.041
<i>It is almost time for bed.</i>

22:04.625 --> 22:08.166
Thanks, Mission Control. Coming home now.

22:11.041 --> 22:12.583
Wait for me!

22:12.666 --> 22:16.041
Loop the Lulu!

22:25.416 --> 22:28.333
We had fun in space, didn't we, Tilly?

22:28.916 --> 22:30.500
<i>Yuèliàng.</i>

22:31.041 --> 22:36.916
Yeah. The moon will be watching over you
all night long.

22:38.166 --> 22:39.458
Good night.

22:42.375 --> 22:43.958
<i>Wn'ān.</i>

22:46.541 --> 22:48.000
Sweet dreams.
