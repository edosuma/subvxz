Yeah, I are.

So, uh, what would one do
if they're feelin' punchy?

00:33.040 --> 00:37.040
Well, I would imagine
if he or she had a punch card,

00:37.040 --> 00:39.330
one might use it. Shwah!

00:39.330 --> 00:41.920
"Shwah," indeed.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.830
To be honest,
I didn't want breakfast.

Oh, to be honest,
I didn't make any.

I hate being late.
Gives me panic sweats.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.880
How's that different
from your on-time sweats?

01:19.750 --> 01:21.250
What are you doing?

01:21.250 --> 01:23.290
Those are Josh's underpants!

Give me those, fool.

is the coffee?

01:30.710 --> 01:32.920
You bitches don't do
anything around here.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.830
That's not true.
Gabi's doing Josh right now.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.170
Ugh, that stupid punch card.

01:39.170 --> 01:43.880
It's so gross that Gabi
has that disgusting sexual
arrangement with Josh.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.670
You're just jealous.

01:45.670 --> 01:48.830
No! It's not like...

01:48.830 --> 01:50.830
everything I've ever wanted.

01:52.710 --> 01:54.920
How many punches
do they have anyway?

01:54.920 --> 01:56.210
Ten.

01:56.210 --> 01:57.250
(crash)

01:58.500 --> 02:00.080
Make that nine.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.620
That was great!

02:03.790 --> 02:05.170
So great.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.620
I mean, this punch card thing
is the best.

02:08.620 --> 02:10.380
Yeah, it's amazing.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.210
We're having sex
without feelings.

02:12.210 --> 02:15.620
I mean, I had feelings
in my parts, but...

02:15.620 --> 02:17.830
not in my hearts.

02:18.830 --> 02:20.120
I gotta be honest
with you, Gabi.

02:20.120 --> 02:24.250
I did not think
you could handle an all sex
non-emotional liaison.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.790
That's funny, because I thought
the same thing about you.

02:26.790 --> 02:29.040
Without the big word
at the end.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.710
Ooh.

02:30.710 --> 02:33.080
We almost
forgot something.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.120
Oh, no, no.
I don't do that.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.210
No. Gabi,
I'm talking about this.

02:42.380 --> 02:44.170
I don't know what
that is, but I don't
do that either.

02:46.210 --> 02:48.500
Gabi, it's a hole-puncher
for our punch cards.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.790
Aw. It's our first punch
out of ten.

02:51.790 --> 02:54.040
Man, I can't believe
we already used one up.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.790
Yeah. We only got nine left.

02:56.790 --> 03:00.080
Yeah. I've got five
and you've got four.

03:01.290 --> 03:03.210
Why do I have to use
the first punch?

03:03.210 --> 03:06.080
You know what?
I'm cool with it.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.500
Age before beauty.

03:10.080 --> 03:14.210
Well, and to be fair,
I will use the next punch.
How's now?

03:14.210 --> 03:16.670
Maybe this time,
beauty can come first.

03:27.210 --> 03:28.880
Oh, my god! Stop!

03:28.880 --> 03:30.750
No, I can't.
I'm starving.

03:32.380 --> 03:35.250
I'm having lots of sex now.

03:35.250 --> 03:39.290
No, no. I, uh--
I need your leftovers to bring
into work for Kendrick.

03:39.290 --> 03:41.080
Ugh! Oh, my god, are you
still after him?

03:41.080 --> 03:44.750
Yes. And your food
is the reason we have lunch
together every day.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.170
He loves your cooking.

03:46.170 --> 03:48.120
Which he actually
thinks is my cooking,

03:48.120 --> 03:50.540
so in a way,
he loves me.

03:51.880 --> 03:55.330
Yeah. You know what else
he loves? His girlfriend.

03:55.330 --> 03:57.290
Yeah, now.

03:58.540 --> 04:00.420
But I have a plan
to be his new girlfriend.

04:00.420 --> 04:02.620
Okay, look, it all
centers around our lunches.

04:02.620 --> 04:06.080
First, I establish myself
as a confidant.

04:06.080 --> 04:10.040
Then, I subliminally
undermine his relationship.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.620
And then finally,

04:11.620 --> 04:13.750
when my  abuelita's hex
starts working...

04:15.000 --> 04:17.580
his relationship
will burn to the ground.

04:17.580 --> 04:21.670
And I will be there to rise
like a phoenix from the ashes.

04:23.540 --> 04:25.710
As his new girlfriend.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.920
Wow, not having sex
for a long time makes you
a little crazy.

04:33.210 --> 04:36.120
Yeah, well, having sex
for a day makes you
a little judgy.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.880
(scoffs) All I'm saying
is what Josh and I have
is working. Okay?

04:39.880 --> 04:44.120
We're getting along great.
We're having sex without
all the neediness and the drama.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.830
And the caring and the trust
and the intimacy.

04:46.830 --> 04:49.750
Yeah, exactly.
All that crap that made us
a really horrible couple.

04:49.750 --> 04:52.790
Gabi, I know you
better than anyone,

04:52.790 --> 04:55.330
and you can not handle
a purely sexual relationship.

04:55.330 --> 04:57.500
It's just a matter of time
before things get weird.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.290
It's not gonna get weird, okay?
Get with the times, Sofia.

05:00.290 --> 05:02.580
Boyfriends are out,
punch cards are in.

05:04.460 --> 05:07.120
That is the stupidest thing
I have ever heard.

05:07.120 --> 05:10.540
Now cook me something
that I can pretend is mine so
Kendrick falls in love with me.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.080
What are you doing?

05:20.080 --> 05:23.080
All the scratching
in the world won't get rid
of that second chin.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.290
I'm on WebMD trying to figure
out what's wrong with my face.

05:28.290 --> 05:30.620
Oh, well, maybe you just
allergic to ugly.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.000
It says the itch
could be anything.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.250
From using a new
shaving cream to--

05:37.250 --> 05:39.380
Wait, what's this?

05:39.380 --> 05:42.670
Oh, that's the new
detergent I'm using. Tude.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.670
"The burning is how
you know it's working."

05:47.670 --> 05:50.170
What the hell kind of
detergent is this?

05:50.170 --> 05:51.540
Cheap.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.460
I got it in the discount aisle.

05:55.170 --> 05:59.080
Wait. Did you wash
Josh's underwear
in that?

05:59.080 --> 06:01.960
Yep. I followed
the instructions.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.540
I added a scoop
to the water.

06:04.540 --> 06:06.080
Waited till the smoke cleared.

06:07.250 --> 06:08.500
Then I added the laundry.

06:08.500 --> 06:12.120
I wiped my face
with his boxers.
That's why I have a rash.

06:12.120 --> 06:15.330
What the hell are you doing
shopping in the discount aisle?

06:15.330 --> 06:16.920
Josh is loaded.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.790
What's your angle?

06:20.420 --> 06:22.330
No angle.

06:22.330 --> 06:25.420
Every month, Josh gives me
a cleaning budget.

06:25.420 --> 06:28.040
Which I manage properly.

06:29.170 --> 06:31.540
So you buy cheap products
and then pocket the rest?

06:31.540 --> 06:32.670
Damn it!

06:33.670 --> 06:35.000
Oh, don't worry.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.420
I won't tell him.

06:36.420 --> 06:38.170
If you cut me
in for half.

06:38.170 --> 06:39.040
Damn it!

06:40.830 --> 06:44.210
I can't believe I'm
being blackmailed by somebody
who's not black!

06:45.330 --> 06:46.580
And barely a male.

06:48.460 --> 06:51.210
Okay, you're in.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.380
Yay!

06:53.380 --> 06:56.710
Now I can buy that
Japanese toilet I've had
my eye on.

06:56.710 --> 06:59.250
I've heard it has
three bidet settings:

06:59.250 --> 07:01.670
gentle, strong,
and Fire Island.

07:04.210 --> 07:05.790
Uh... hey, guys?

07:05.790 --> 07:09.000
Anyone else feel
a little itchy?

07:09.000 --> 07:10.920
-Oh, no.
-No.

07:10.920 --> 07:15.420
Why would we feel itchy?
I buy top-of-the-line detergent.

07:15.420 --> 07:18.000
I'm gonna go call
my concierge doctor and see
what he thinks it is.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.620
Great idea, boss!

07:20.620 --> 07:23.750
What if the doctor tells him
his itch is from
a cheap detergent?

07:23.750 --> 07:26.040
Crap! If we're gonna keep
this scam going,

07:26.040 --> 07:28.830
we've got to rewash all of
Josh's things.

07:28.830 --> 07:31.290
Quick! Go upstairs
and get all of his underwear!

07:32.920 --> 07:34.460
Best day ever!

07:37.420 --> 07:41.250
Hm. And the itching
just presented itself
this afternoon?

07:41.250 --> 07:43.120
Yep.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.750
A lot of it.

07:44.750 --> 07:47.620
On... (whispers) my junk.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.830
Well, it could be many things.

07:51.830 --> 07:54.080
Dermatitis, an allergy.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.540
Do you have any new
sexual partners?

07:57.540 --> 07:59.670
(laughs)

07:59.670 --> 08:02.290
Actually, doc, um...

08:02.290 --> 08:05.120
I have a little thing
going on with-- Wait.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.830
Why?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.750
Before we jump to
any conclusions,

08:09.750 --> 08:12.380
why don't you take
a few pictures of the affected
area and email them to me.

08:12.380 --> 08:16.500
Hopefully they won't end up
in my junk box.

08:18.420 --> 08:20.120
(laughs)

08:23.120 --> 08:26.710
Sofia: Hey, do you remember how
stupid you thought my stupid
plan was?

08:26.710 --> 08:29.120
Talk louder, Sofia.
You're over by
the grilled cheese.

08:30.290 --> 08:32.250
Well, my stupid plan
worked. Okay?

08:32.250 --> 08:34.380
Because Kendrick got into a huge
fight with his girlfriend,

08:34.380 --> 08:37.920
so I invited him over for dinner
to be his shoulder to cry on.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.250
And he said yes.

08:39.250 --> 08:40.500
So, uh, if I'm lucky,

08:40.500 --> 08:43.120
maybe he'll cry on other
parts of my body, too.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.960
Ha! The power of my cooking.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.670
Now she's the leftovers.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.330
So, what famous specialty
of yours am I making

08:52.330 --> 08:55.000
for you and your maybe
future boyfriend tonight?

08:55.000 --> 08:58.170
Well, he says he likes
a good baba ghanoush.

08:59.210 --> 09:00.830
Can you make a baba ghanoush?

09:02.120 --> 09:03.790
Oh, I can make a baba
do anything.

09:03.790 --> 09:05.170
Ask Josh.

09:06.290 --> 09:08.250
I'm guessing you said,
"Ask Josh"

09:08.250 --> 09:10.040
because you want to tell me
how great your

09:10.040 --> 09:11.670
sex punch card thing's going?

09:11.670 --> 09:13.420
Oh, well, since you asked,

09:13.420 --> 09:15.170
amazing.

09:15.170 --> 09:18.000
You were so wrong. It's not
weird at all, and it's never
gonna get weird.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.000
Okay, it just got weird.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.290
So, he was just...

09:41.290 --> 09:43.290
rocking out with his... out?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.120
Yeah!

09:46.120 --> 09:48.080
I mean, he was taking
pictures from every angle.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.920
I mean, from the front
and then from the back.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.670
And then through the legs

09:51.670 --> 09:53.880
and then over the shoulder.
And then-- And then

09:53.880 --> 09:57.960
he set it on his desk
and he separated things
to show a panorama style.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.540
Ew!

09:59.540 --> 10:01.170
-He took a peni-rama?
-Yeah!

10:02.460 --> 10:03.960
Why would he do that?

10:03.960 --> 10:07.170
Well, why do you think, Gabi?
To text it to you.

10:07.170 --> 10:08.420
Pfft, Josh? No!

10:08.420 --> 10:10.620
Yes. What do
you expect, flowers?

10:10.620 --> 10:13.120
No, we're not dating.

10:13.120 --> 10:16.710
Exactly. So instead of getting
peonies, you're getting peo-nis.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.710
Oh, my god.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.330
What am I supposed to do
when he sends them to me?

10:21.330 --> 10:23.330
I mean, how am I
supposed to respond?

10:23.330 --> 10:25.120
I miss landlines.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.880
Okay. Kendrick--

10:26.880 --> 10:29.080
Kendrick's on his way,
so can you just chop while
you freak out?

10:29.080 --> 10:31.710
Yeah, but how am
I supposed to feel?
I mean, am I turned on?

10:31.710 --> 10:35.080
Am I turned off?
I mean, is it sick?
Is it sexy?

10:35.080 --> 10:38.710
Gabi, if you have to ask,
it's not for you.

10:38.710 --> 10:41.210
Look, Gabi, you used to
have feelings for him
so you can't just

10:41.210 --> 10:44.250
suddenly start having sex
with him and not have feelings.

10:44.250 --> 10:47.120
I mean, maybe Josh can.
Guys can have sex and be
totally cool with it.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.750
But you can't!
You don't have it in you, Gabi.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.420
Oh, yeah?

10:51.420 --> 10:52.830
I do, I've got it in me!

10:52.830 --> 10:54.620
I can send penis pictures
as good as the next guy.

10:54.620 --> 10:57.080
-Oh, my god, Gabi.
You have to stop-- Okay.
-(camera clicks)

10:59.120 --> 11:01.120
-And send to Josh.
-(whoosh)

11:01.120 --> 11:02.830
See? Totally cool with it. Hm.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.250
What happened to your bra?

11:05.250 --> 11:06.580
I left it at work.

11:12.290 --> 11:15.880
Well, I got rid
of the Tude.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.210
It's about time.
What did you do
with the cheap detergent?

11:20.210 --> 11:22.580
Okay, listen.
I was thinking about it,

11:22.580 --> 11:25.420
and if Josh mentions
his itch again,

11:25.420 --> 11:28.000
the key is to stay cool.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.830
Right. Deny, deny, deny.

11:30.830 --> 11:32.000
-Let's practice.
-Okay.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.080
-You sit down.
I'll be Josh.
-Mm-hmm. Okay.

11:36.460 --> 11:37.790
Oh, hey, Yolanda.

11:37.790 --> 11:39.420
I stole your money!

11:42.920 --> 11:44.670
What the hell was that?

11:44.670 --> 11:46.250
What happened to
black don't crack?

11:47.580 --> 11:49.330
I panicked.

11:49.330 --> 11:51.460
And I don't think it means that.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.420
Hey, guys.

11:53.420 --> 11:55.210
I talked to my doctor.

11:55.210 --> 11:58.920
Be cool, Yolanda. Take off
that butter face, put on
your poker face.

12:00.380 --> 12:02.290
He told me what
the itch could be from.

12:02.290 --> 12:04.120
Could be an allergy,
could be dermatitis,

12:04.120 --> 12:05.540
and there is
a slight possibility

12:05.540 --> 12:07.670
but practically impossible
chance that it's an STD.

12:07.670 --> 12:10.120
-I pick STD.
-Yep, that's the one.

12:11.790 --> 12:13.790
But the only person
I'm having sex with
is Gabi.

12:13.790 --> 12:18.420
Exactly. She's the only
employee in this house
involved in your itch.

12:19.790 --> 12:21.620
Hold up, wait a second, Elliot.

12:21.620 --> 12:23.960
Josh, Gabi didn't give you
an STD.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.040
Yes, she did.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.080
No punch card,
no STD.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.250
Punch card, STD.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.120
Do the math, man.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.170
It's not from Gabi, 'cause she's
not sleeping with anybody else.

12:36.170 --> 12:38.460
And she's not like that.
She's sweet and innocent.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.120
She's not some girl gone wild.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.040
(phone chimes)

12:45.120 --> 12:47.080
Oh, my god.
She's a girl gone wild.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.000
Ew, boobies!

12:51.710 --> 12:55.040
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Josh, Josh. This has gone
far enough.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.250
Now, you need to know

12:56.250 --> 12:58.920
that all of this is
because of the Tude.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.210
Oh, you got that right.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.290
She has a serious 'tude
and she's gonna hear about
it right now.

13:03.710 --> 13:04.750
(door shuts)

13:04.750 --> 13:08.170
All this trouble because of
one little box.

13:09.380 --> 13:10.750
And the detergent.

13:23.790 --> 13:26.290
(sighs)

13:26.290 --> 13:28.080
It just doesn't
make any sense.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.250
You're right. Kendrick
and I should sit on opposite
sides of the table so that--

13:31.250 --> 13:33.460
I'm talking about Josh.

13:33.460 --> 13:37.250
Why hasn't he responded
to my boobs pic? I mean,
you saw them, they look amazing.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.540
Gabi, Kendrick's gonna
be here in 20 minutes.

13:39.540 --> 13:41.920
And, uh, where is
my penis picture?

13:41.920 --> 13:44.750
I mean, you told me Josh
was gonna text me his penis pic.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.290
(gasps) Why hasn't he
sent me his penis pic?

13:46.290 --> 13:48.170
Why can't I stop
saying penis?

13:49.380 --> 13:51.290
Sofia, wait, wait.

13:51.290 --> 13:56.120
What if I haven't gotten it yet
because he texted it to
another woman?

13:56.120 --> 13:58.880
Gabi, you have to stop
and finish the dinner
I'm making.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.380
(sighs)

14:01.380 --> 14:04.580
Sofia, how can I cook
when Josh is sleeping
with someone else?

14:04.580 --> 14:07.120
(sighs) I told you this was how
it was all gonna go down.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.250
Yeah, which he is probably
doing to another woman
right now.

14:09.250 --> 14:10.460
Look at you.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.540
You're upset, you're hurt,
you're jealous.

14:12.540 --> 14:15.040
What are those things
called again?
Oh, yeah, feelings.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.290
(scoffs) I'm not having
any feelings. Okay?

14:17.290 --> 14:21.540
What do I care if Josh is
sending penis pictures to every
girl in America except for me.

14:22.540 --> 14:25.080
Gabi, you know how much
I care about you.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.380
-(knocking)
-Oh, my god. Kendrick's here.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.120
(Gabi and Josh gasp)

14:32.120 --> 14:33.330
Both: You're sleeping
with someone else!

14:37.380 --> 14:39.170
Okay, this is what
we're gonna do.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.920
I'm gonna give you two minutes
to solve this

14:40.920 --> 14:43.170
while I go do some
optimistic shaving.

14:45.830 --> 14:48.210
Where on earth would you
get the idea that I'm sleeping
with someone else?

14:48.210 --> 14:50.670
Oh, let's just say
a picture paints
a thousand words.

14:50.670 --> 14:52.460
What do you mean, picture?
What picture?

14:52.460 --> 14:55.540
Uh, I saw you
in your office
taking some...

14:55.540 --> 14:57.170
lower selfies.

14:59.210 --> 15:00.290
Oh, my god, you saw--

15:00.290 --> 15:02.290
The panorama,
the lift and separate?

15:02.290 --> 15:03.750
Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:03.750 --> 15:07.040
I saw them all, Josh.
But I didn't see them
on my phone.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.670
Wanna know why?
Because you didn't
send them to me,

15:08.670 --> 15:10.380
you sent them to someone else!
Who'd you send them to?

15:11.380 --> 15:12.880
For your information,

15:12.880 --> 15:14.290
I sent them to a doctor.

15:14.290 --> 15:16.170
(gasps)

15:16.170 --> 15:20.460
You're dating a doctor?
What, so now I'm not
smart enough for you anymore?

15:20.460 --> 15:23.080
I'm not dating anybody.
You're the one seeing
someone else.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.420
What are you talking about?

15:24.420 --> 15:27.750
Aw, don't act so innocent.
I'm very smart. I know things.

15:27.750 --> 15:31.000
Oh, really? Yeah, name--
name one thing you know.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.500
I know why my groin's so itchy.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.210
-What?
-Yeah.

15:37.210 --> 15:40.290
I sent those photos to
a doctor because of the rash
from the STD you gave me.

15:40.290 --> 15:41.920
-What?
-And now you know what?

15:41.920 --> 15:43.830
It serves me right
for having a punch card

15:43.830 --> 15:45.420
with someone young
and irresponsible.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.960
You're sleeping
with other people
while you're sleeping with me.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.380
You're what my mother
would call a hussy.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.000
(gasps) Oh, yeah?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.580
Well, you're what my father
would call a man-hussy.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.000
A mussy.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.290
(gasps)

15:56.290 --> 15:59.290
(panting) She didn't sleep
with anyone else!

15:59.290 --> 16:00.960
It was the detergent.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.880
Great. So now,
there's more people.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.170
Josh, your rash was my fault.

16:06.170 --> 16:09.080
I used a cheap brand
of detergent to wash
your underpants.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.290
Ask Elliot, he was itching too.

16:14.170 --> 16:15.790
You were wearing my underpants?

16:15.790 --> 16:17.670
No!

16:17.670 --> 16:19.620
I was just wiping
my face with them.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.500
Sofia:
Okay.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.580
Don't you see what
is happening here?

16:26.580 --> 16:28.330
Nobody was sleeping
with anybody.

16:28.330 --> 16:30.380
Except for you two because of
that stupid punch card.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.620
Which as I predicted
didn't solve anything

16:32.620 --> 16:34.540
because you still have
the same issues you had
without it.

16:34.540 --> 16:36.170
No, we don't.

16:36.170 --> 16:38.250
Oh, okay, really?
So, you weren't jealous

16:38.250 --> 16:40.330
when you thought Josh
was sending pictures
to other women?

16:41.500 --> 16:42.920
I do not recall.

16:44.750 --> 16:47.790
And you weren't jealous
when you came barging in here

16:47.790 --> 16:49.210
accusing Gabi
of sleeping around?

16:50.210 --> 16:51.040
I do not recall.

16:52.250 --> 16:55.120
Guys, just admit it.
You're not punch card people.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.170
Okay? Now, I have
a normal date

16:57.170 --> 16:58.710
who's gonna be here
any second,

16:58.710 --> 17:00.790
so if you guys don't leave,
you are not invited
to our wedding.

17:00.790 --> 17:02.670
Which, I promise
will be spectacular

17:02.670 --> 17:03.920
and in Barcelona!

17:08.880 --> 17:10.670
She does kinda
sorta have a point.

17:10.670 --> 17:13.120
Yeah, I guess this is
starting to feel a little...

17:13.120 --> 17:15.080
boyfriendy-girlfriendy.

17:16.210 --> 17:18.290
What? So, should we
just stop this whole--

17:18.290 --> 17:21.120
Yeah, I think we should.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.040
-Well, it was fun
while it lasted.
-Yeah.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.000
No. No, it wasn't.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.750
Please leave.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.670
Josh, I need
to tell you something.

17:30.670 --> 17:32.170
The reason I was
buying cheap detergent--

17:32.170 --> 17:33.830
Yolanda, I know why.

17:33.830 --> 17:35.250
-You do?
-Yes.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.120
I'm obviously not giving
you enough money to shop with,

17:37.120 --> 17:39.500
so why don't I just double
what I give you now?

17:43.210 --> 17:44.920
I think that would be
for the best.

17:49.420 --> 17:52.170
Great. Now, not to
change the subject but...

17:52.170 --> 17:53.620
how do I look?

17:54.880 --> 17:56.000
Like you have low self-esteem.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.920
Sofia Rodriguez?

17:59.920 --> 18:01.330
-Yes.
-These are for you.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.250
Thank you. Oh!
They're from Kendrick.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.540
-Aw.
-(clears throat)

18:06.580 --> 18:08.540
"I got back
with my girlfriend

18:08.540 --> 18:10.290
"so I can't make dinner.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.250
But thanks for being
such a good listener."

18:12.250 --> 18:13.290
Aw.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.420
-Oh, my god.
-I'm sorry, Sofia.

18:17.420 --> 18:19.210
He sent me flowers!

18:33.040 --> 18:34.250
(sighs)

18:36.290 --> 18:38.040
-(line trilling)
-(phone ringing)

18:41.960 --> 18:44.290
That's funny, I was just
gonna call you.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.170
Oh, well, great minds
think alike.

18:47.380 --> 18:50.120
So, um, here's what
my mind was thinking.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.880
It's not that we can't
handle a punch card,

18:52.880 --> 18:55.420
it's that the punch card
has a little flaw.

18:55.420 --> 18:57.000
We forgot about rules.

18:58.290 --> 18:59.830
Go on.

18:59.830 --> 19:01.920
So, we're obviously
two cute people.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.670
Extremely.

19:03.670 --> 19:06.250
Who will eventually date
other cute people.

19:06.250 --> 19:08.120
I mean, why wouldn't we?

19:08.120 --> 19:09.710
Exactly, I mean,
we're not a couple.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.620
Not... a couple.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.670
So, we need a rule.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.210
I like rules.

19:16.210 --> 19:20.670
To prevent any jealous feelings,
if I start dating someone,
I'll let you know.

19:20.670 --> 19:22.710
And if you start dating someone,
you let me know.

19:22.710 --> 19:25.210
And then we just, uh...
we put the punch card on hold.

19:25.210 --> 19:27.000
The tell and hold.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.920
That is a genius rule.
How did we not think of that?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.210
I don't know,
cute people are dumb.

19:33.460 --> 19:35.080
So...

19:35.080 --> 19:36.920
the punch card
is back on?

19:36.920 --> 19:38.880
Mm-hmm.
Back in business, baby.

19:40.170 --> 19:42.620
As long as--
As long as there
are no feelings.

19:42.620 --> 19:44.000
Nope. None here. You?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.750
Nope. Not a one.

19:45.750 --> 19:48.830
I am so relieved.

19:48.830 --> 19:50.250
Me too.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.080
(chuckles)

19:53.210 --> 19:54.250
What? What's so funny?

19:55.960 --> 19:57.250
Have you seen
"Raccoon with a Broom"?

19:57.250 --> 19:59.120
-No.
-All right, well...

20:00.120 --> 20:01.420
-(chimes)
-here it comes.

20:02.460 --> 20:05.000
(gasps) He's sweeping.

20:06.210 --> 20:07.710
Oh!

20:08.920 --> 20:10.830
Ooh! Have you seen
the video of the baby hedgehog?

20:10.830 --> 20:12.750
No! (gasps)
Let's watch it together.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.250
(tablet chimes)

20:14.250 --> 20:17.210
You know, not being
in a relationship is awesome.

20:17.210 --> 20:19.040
Yeah, it's the best.

20:21.250 --> 20:24.120
Aw! The little hedgehog's
driving a little car.

20:24.120 --> 20:27.460
Aw, that's so cute.
Look, he just picked up
his little mouse friend.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.040
Josh:
Do they remind you
of anybody?

20:29.040 --> 20:30.290
Gabi:
Elliot and Yolanda.

20:30.290 --> 20:31.210
Josh:
I mean!

20:35.880 --> 20:37.080
(sniffing, exhaling)

20:41.170 --> 20:43.290
Those are boy jeans.

20:43.290 --> 20:44.120
Why do you have boy jeans?

20:44.120 --> 20:46.460
Oh, uh, they're Kendrick's.

20:46.460 --> 20:48.080
I accidentally spilled
your leftovers on them,

20:48.080 --> 20:49.580
so I offered to wash them.

20:49.580 --> 20:52.620
Oh, no. Uh, don't use that,
that's the stuff that
gives you a rash.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.210
Is it? Oh.

20:54.210 --> 20:55.620
God, I would hate
for him to think

20:55.620 --> 20:56.960
his girlfriend
gave him an STD.

20:57.960 --> 20:58.960
(gasps)

21:02.210 --> 21:04.170
You spilled those leftovers
on purpose.

21:05.380 --> 21:06.830
-Did I?
-(gasps)

21:08.080 --> 21:09.790
Phoenix!
