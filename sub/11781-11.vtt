and one in high fashion.

Do you trust India?

00:20.621 --> 00:22.556
I just think she's

00:22.590 --> 00:24.092
a little shady.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.526
I'm afraid we
have to say goodbye.

I hope you're happy.

What if he doesn't
want to see me?

Jane. He was in
a juvenile detention center,
not a brainwashing camp.

You'll be the first person
he wants to see.

be different with you two?

to tell me what that
something was, exactly?

Well, then
Jeremy came in and I
didn't know what to do

02:31.219 --> 02:33.254
and then Billy ran out
and the next morning
he got sent away

02:33.287 --> 02:35.423

it's been playing on a loop
in my head.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.458
"It's you, it's you,
it's you." What do
you think it means?

Well, I may be
totally off-base here,

02:40.628 --> 02:44.198

think he might have
meant it romantically?

No. No, no, no.

for a second.

talk or something?

non-stop ever since
we got in the car, Jane.

to talk about, okay?

to talk about that.

has been lackluster.

you simply have none.

In your time here

been working here

harder to replace India

11:13.073 --> 11:17.244
I say, "Over whom?"
And, "In pumps or flats?"

11:17.277 --> 11:20.213
I just really hope
this new girl works out.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.816
(SNIFFLING)

11:22.850 --> 11:24.818
Well, don't get
your hopes up.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.057
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

11:30.523 --> 11:31.892
Hey.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.864
What can I do for you,

11:36.897 --> 11:38.866
muffin?

11:38.899 --> 11:42.002
That's a "no" on kissing
at work and the whole
muffin thing.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.739
Yeah, I know.
It didn't quite feel
right coming out.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.776
I need the kids here
to respect me, Ben.
We need to be professional.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.811
Got it. We're on
the same page.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.813
So, what's up?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.784
I had a conversation
with Jane this morning.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.518
I'm just a little concerned.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.754
Don't worry.
She's good with it.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.322
With us dating.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.193
No. Ben.
I'm concerned about Jane.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.763
I just got
her progress report
and she's falling behind.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.900
I think this internship
is just too demanding
on her, don't you?

12:14.134 --> 12:17.905
Actually, I kind of
think it's been good.

12:17.938 --> 12:22.309
But I promise I'll make sure
she stays focused on school.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.777
You know why?

12:23.811 --> 12:25.745
Because your love life
depends on it?

12:25.913 --> 12:27.014
Bingo.

12:33.854 --> 12:38.926
I know
you've all been working
tremendously hard lately.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.895
But you're
gonna have to work
tremendously harder.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.131
Donovan Decker
has been selected
to collaborate

12:44.164 --> 12:45.899
on a capsule collection

12:45.933 --> 12:49.569
with one of the world's
most famous luxury
department stores,

12:49.602 --> 12:50.804
Harrods.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.907
That is,
unless we blow it.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.243
And we cannot blow it.
Understood?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.145
(SOFTLY) Okay.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.247
Didn't I fire you?

13:01.915 --> 13:03.150
No.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.852
Oh.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.087
See me in my office
afterwards.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.824
The style director
assigned to oversee
our Harrods collection

13:10.858 --> 13:12.592
will be coming by tomorrow.

13:12.625 --> 13:17.097
Now, can anyone
tell me what is our
number one priority?

13:18.866 --> 13:19.867
Carter?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.370
Um, to impress
the style director

13:23.403 --> 13:26.840
and ensure Harrods is
confident that Donovan Decker
has what it takes?

13:26.874 --> 13:28.041
Precisely.

13:28.075 --> 13:31.178
Now, I need
all hands on deck
for the next two days.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.981
No exceptions.
Is that clear?

13:35.983 --> 13:38.285
If that is clear,
then walk away
and get back to work.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.889
Now.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.858
Can I talk to you
for a moment?

13:44.892 --> 13:46.126
As long as
Gray doesn't see.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.594
Because apparently,
we're all supposed to be

13:47.627 --> 13:50.964
working tremendously
harder than we were before.
Whatever that means.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.332
Did you hear
that she fired Sally?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.968
Do youRight.Suzy?

13:55.002 --> 13:56.870
Oh, my gosh.
I'm turning into
Gray, aren't I?

13:56.904 --> 13:57.871
Not that that would
be a bad thing.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.606
I just tJane!.. What?

13:59.639 --> 14:01.875
I'm going to tell you
something and I need
you not to react, okay?

14:01.909 --> 14:04.044
No, no, no, no.
I'm serious, Jane.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.345
Okay.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.014
Gray is giving you
India's old job.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.281
What? Me?

14:10.317 --> 14:11.651
No reaction.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.887
Right. (SIGHS)

14:13.921 --> 14:16.123
Take over India's job?

14:16.156 --> 14:18.992
I am so not ready for that.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.194
Then you best get ready.

14:41.681 --> 14:45.152
* It could be worse
We could be alone

14:46.453 --> 14:51.324
* You could be a tree
I could be a star

14:51.358 --> 14:54.194
* Since you have me
and I have you

14:54.227 --> 14:56.930
BILLY: Janey? You ready?

14:56.964 --> 14:58.398
JANE: Almost!
I'll be out in a minute!

15:01.368 --> 15:04.337
* We may get down
We may get damaged

15:08.008 --> 15:09.977
Good morning, Billy.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.945
You mind
handing me the milk?

15:11.979 --> 15:13.246
Yes. Of course.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.422
Oh, and Miss Shaw?

15:22.455 --> 15:24.024
Yes, Billy?

15:25.125 --> 15:26.526
I think your
toast is ready.

15:31.164 --> 15:34.067
* We're always where
I'm going to

15:36.136 --> 15:39.006
* Sometimes I starve
Sometimes we manage *

15:39.039 --> 15:42.142
Wait. You're actually
considering this?

15:42.409 --> 15:44.011
No.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.980
Yes? I don't know.

15:47.014 --> 15:50.083
I mean, taking India's
old job would be the
opportunity of a lifetime.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.052
How could I say no?

15:52.085 --> 15:54.021
Nothing, I...

15:55.155 --> 15:55.989
I just...

15:56.023 --> 15:58.458
You'd really consider
leaving here?

15:58.491 --> 16:01.228
Just leaving
school behind?

16:02.295 --> 16:04.164
Maybe. Why?

16:04.197 --> 16:05.532
No reason.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.000
Talk to me, Billy.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.401
No, I'm good.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.203
Oh, you're good?
Is that right?

16:10.237 --> 16:12.405
Yeah. It is.

16:12.439 --> 16:15.008
So, now you're mad at me?

16:15.042 --> 16:17.344
Yeah. I am.
Billy, you've been
shutting me out.

16:17.377 --> 16:20.080
About everything.
What is going on with you?

16:20.113 --> 16:22.282
And how can I help if
you won't even talk to me?

16:22.315 --> 16:23.750
What do you
want to talk about?

16:23.783 --> 16:26.153
For starters, how about
the fashion show?

16:26.186 --> 16:28.055
You ran out before
we could even have
a conversation.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.389
It was nothing, Janey.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.392
Nothing? That's your story?

16:34.194 --> 16:36.096
Look, I was
in a bad place.

16:36.129 --> 16:39.066
I was getting
sent away. That's it.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.101
There's nothing
for us to talk about.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.036
Things are different now.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.237
I'm different.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.472
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.174
What is that
supposed to mean?

16:47.207 --> 16:49.242
It means
you have changed.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.211
And, if you ask me,
it's not for the better.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.214
Hmm.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.216
I didn't ask you, Jane.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.153
Fine!
Then be that way!

17:00.187 --> 17:02.055
Well, then do it!

17:02.089 --> 17:03.523
I said I will!

17:05.125 --> 17:07.127
What was that about?

17:07.160 --> 17:09.196
I don't know, Ben.
Maybe I took your advice

17:09.229 --> 17:11.398
and I tried to talk
to him about the whole
"it's you" thing

17:11.431 --> 17:13.533
and maybe it backfired.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.203
Sorry about that.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.175
BEN: I'm worried about Billy.

17:22.209 --> 17:25.245
It can't be easy for
him to fall back into
his old life here.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.315
Well, maybe you could
help him find something
positive to focus on?

17:28.348 --> 17:29.816
Such as?

17:29.849 --> 17:32.185
I don't know,
maybe an activity
or something?

17:32.219 --> 17:34.821
Like mathletes.
Or chess club.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.090

17:37.124 --> 17:40.160
Come on. (CHUCKLES)
Chess? Mathletes?

17:40.193 --> 17:42.095
What, do you want him to
be more of an outcast?

17:42.129 --> 17:43.496
Those are terrible clubs.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.098
I was in
those clubs, Ben.

17:45.132 --> 17:48.368
And you were
adorable doing it. Shoot.

17:48.401 --> 17:52.105
Vice Principal Jenkins!
What a surprise to
see you! In the hall.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.274
At school.
Where we work.
Hey, Rita.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.309
What're you naughty kids
up to this fine morning?

17:56.343 --> 17:59.246
Naughty?
Why would you even...
We are... Were...

17:59.279 --> 18:01.481
We were just talking.
That is all.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.183
I said "mop"!

18:03.216 --> 18:04.484
And I'llGood idea.ing now.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.618
Good morning, Jenkins.

18:05.652 --> 18:08.155
Good morning, Rita. And...

18:09.922 --> 18:11.258
Ben.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.530
(SIGHS) That was close.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.132
No.
That was awkward.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.367
Really awkward.
What's gotten into you?

18:20.400 --> 18:23.203
You said you want
to keep it professional
at work, right?

18:23.236 --> 18:26.139
Do yoKnows what?knows?

18:26.173 --> 18:27.607
About you and me, of course.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.242
How would
he know that, Ben?

18:29.276 --> 18:32.279
Are you kidding?
We ooze chemistry.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.113
Don't say ooze.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.688
Hi.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.156
Hi.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.491
How are you, Billy?

18:44.524 --> 18:46.259
Oh, you know how it is,

18:46.293 --> 18:48.561
just trying to get
my bearings back.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.930
ThatYep.ood.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.166
So, what's been
going on with you?

18:54.201 --> 18:56.436
Sorry. Stupid question.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.238
So, you and Fadden, huh?

18:58.271 --> 19:01.241
How's that one
working out for you?

19:01.274 --> 19:04.211
To be honest,
I thought it was
going pretty well.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.946
That is until
you got back.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.648
I thought I could
forget about us, but...

19:08.681 --> 19:11.918
There is no more us, Lu.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.587
But I really do
hope things between
you and Nick work out.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.590
Because you deserve it.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.273
You're precipitating.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.443
Your calcium is starting
to form a precipitate.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.611
You should
dry out the crystals.

19:38.645 --> 19:39.746
Oh. Um...

19:41.348 --> 19:42.382
Thanks.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.386
BMmm-hmm.?

19:48.388 --> 19:50.690
You're not gonna
cut me any slack
here, are you?

19:52.559 --> 19:54.427
Maybe.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.595
But just a little.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.798
Okay.
I guess I deserve that.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.671
I'm really sorry, Jane.

20:04.704 --> 20:08.308
For what it's worth,
I made a big mistake.

20:08.341 --> 20:11.411
Huge, in fact.
And I regret it.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.481
It's fine.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.384
Really,
I'm just distracted.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.387
And you know what?
I think it all worked out
for the best.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.555
You and Lulu
seem very happy.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.357
Yeah.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.259
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

20:26.293 --> 20:27.360
I...

20:30.430 --> 20:32.299
Is everything okay?

20:32.332 --> 20:34.267
Yeah, it's just, um...

20:34.301 --> 20:36.303
(SCHOOh, I, uh...ING)

20:36.536 --> 20:37.570
I have to go.

Oh. Yeah.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.310
Thanks.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.784
You wanted to see me, Ben?

20:51.818 --> 20:54.287
Good hands.
Good hands.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.388
Thanks.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.724
First day back.
How're you doing?

20:58.858 --> 21:00.327
I'm fine, Ben.

21:02.529 --> 21:05.832
Oh, I get it.
This must be the part where
you ask me how I'm adjusting.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.700
No, I just thought

21:07.734 --> 21:11.070
now that you're back,
you might want to hit
the ground running.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.472
Find a positive outlet.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.307
For what?

21:14.341 --> 21:17.444
I don't know, something
to keep you busy.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.578
Focus your energy.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.812
Such as...

21:19.846 --> 21:22.749
How about football?

21:22.782 --> 21:24.451
(LAUGHS) Seriously?

21:24.484 --> 21:27.520
Yeah. You got a pair
of hands on you. I mean,

21:27.554 --> 21:30.757
you're a little stringy,
but you're probably
very elusive.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.325
Hard to tackle.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.094
Baseball?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.763
Oh, my. Are you
kidding me right now?

21:36.796 --> 21:37.997
Why not just give it a shot?

21:38.030 --> 21:41.734
Look, Ben.
I appreciate you trying
to help reacclimate me

21:41.768 --> 21:43.603
or whatever it is that
you're trying to do here.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.072
But, in case
you hadn't noticed,

21:46.105 --> 21:48.508
I'm not really
the team sport type.

21:50.677 --> 21:53.880
Are you sure
you're doing okay?

21:54.881 --> 21:56.549
I'm fine.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.785
Because,
Jane told me about...

21:58.818 --> 22:00.387
Do you really want
to do this, Benjamin?

22:00.420 --> 22:02.422
I'd prefer if we didn't.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.723
JANE: Excuse me.
Coming through.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.825
Hi, guys. I have
to leave school because
of an emergency at work

22:05.858 --> 22:07.159
and Rita can't know
under any circumstances

22:07.193 --> 22:09.796
because then I would
lose my internship
and that can't happen.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.432
So I really need you guys
to help me out okay?
Can you cover for me?

22:12.465 --> 22:14.401
I donNo way.k so.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.635
What?

22:15.668 --> 22:17.770
Look, I know that
you are mad at me

22:17.804 --> 22:20.373
and that you don't
really like to do
this sort of thing,

22:20.407 --> 22:23.810
but can't you just
cover for me? Maybe like
a cold, cramps, anything.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.513
I don't like
lying to Rita.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.781
It's just a teeny-tiny
little white lie.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.650
And that's how
it all starts.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.419
That's correct.

22:32.452 --> 22:35.121
Fine.
I don't need your help.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.356
I can handle
this on my own.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.526
* It's been so

22:40.827 --> 22:43.563
* It's been so
But I know

22:44.497 --> 22:46.933
* So long

22:46.966 --> 22:49.536
* I'm kissing good-bye
so pucker up

22:55.708 --> 22:58.445
* So long
Pack it up *

23:00.747 --> 23:02.949
Oops. Sorry. Sorry.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.817
That's okay.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.586
Hey, I'm actually
a little lost.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.921
Oh, well,
maybe I can point you
in the right direction.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.557
Who are you
delivering those to?

23:10.590 --> 23:12.559
You think I'm
a flower delivery guy?

23:12.592 --> 23:14.927
I did. A second ago.
Now I'm a little unsure.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.463
They're for
Gray Chandler Murray.

23:16.496 --> 23:17.830
Oh. Great.
I'm Gray's assistant. Jane.

23:17.864 --> 23:20.533
So I can just
take those to her.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.969
I'd rather give
them to her myself
if that's okay.

23:23.002 --> 23:26.473
The thing is Gray's
not exactly the hand
delivery type.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.508
What type is she?

23:28.541 --> 23:29.976
She's more of a
"don't bother me with
that kind of crap" type.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.678
So, if you're not
the flower delivery guy,
who are you?

23:31.711 --> 23:33.713
Eli. I have an
appointment with Gray.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.247
Today?

23:35.281 --> 23:38.518
No, it's tomorrow.
I just thought I'd get here
early in case I got lost.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.553
Why would you
get here a whole day...

23:40.587 --> 23:42.722
Oh, that was a joke.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.857
You didn't laugh.

23:44.891 --> 23:47.560
Well, it wasn't
laugh out loud funny.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.862
The thing is Gray
doesn't have any
appointments today.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.498
Well, she called me directly.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.600
Gray? Called you?
On the phone?

23:53.633 --> 23:54.801
Yeah. Crazy, right?

23:54.834 --> 23:56.503
So, what is this
appointment about?

23:56.536 --> 23:58.237
Something about
a job opening.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.607
A job. And you're
interviewing for it?

24:00.640 --> 24:04.477
Yeah. Are you gonna
point me in the right
direction or should I...

24:04.511 --> 24:05.745
Oh, gosh. Yes, sorry.
Right this way.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.747
So, you got any tips for me?

24:08.047 --> 24:09.549
Tips?

24:09.582 --> 24:11.551
Yeah, you know, like
advice for the interview.

24:11.584 --> 24:14.621
Oh, um, just don't
take anything Gray says
to you personally.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.624
She can be a little cold.

24:17.657 --> 24:18.991
So, you're saying
she's mean?

24:19.025 --> 24:20.693
Oh, no, no, no.
Not mean.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.662
She's juNice?t very...

24:22.695 --> 24:24.497
Eli, you're here!

24:24.531 --> 24:27.534
Oh! And you
brought me flowers.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.936
Yeah, well, I haven't
seen you in a while.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.604
And I know lilies
are your favorite.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.640
Jane, I see you've
met my nephew, Eli.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.643
Yeah, we... Nephew?

24:36.676 --> 24:39.245
Yeah. Jane was actually
just talking about you.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.947
Oh. And what did she say?

24:42.582 --> 24:43.816
Only that you're

24:43.850 --> 24:46.285
warm and gorgeous
and incredibly talented.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.920
Is that right?

24:47.954 --> 24:50.590
That is right.

24:50.623 --> 24:53.526
Eli, come into my office.
Jane, hold all my calls.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.830
It was nice to
meet you, Jane.

24:59.699 --> 25:00.833
Nephew?

25:01.934 --> 25:03.836
(BOTH LAUGHING)

25:10.309 --> 25:11.578
Who is that?

25:12.111 --> 25:14.013
His name is Eli.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.648
I don't like
the look of him.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.585
Well, you should probably
keep that one to yourself.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.952
And why is that?

25:19.986 --> 25:22.589
Because he is
Gray's nephew.

25:22.622 --> 25:26.593
And from the looks of it,
he might also be India's
new replacement.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.729
(BOTH LAUGHING)

25:42.008 --> 25:43.743
He seems great.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.011
He is.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.980
Something you want to add?

25:48.014 --> 25:49.949
No. I...

25:49.982 --> 25:51.918
Spit it out, Jane.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.853
I just...

25:53.886 --> 25:55.722
I feel a little
silly saying this,

25:55.755 --> 25:57.890
but for a second there
I thought that

25:57.924 --> 25:59.792
I was in the running
for India's job.

26:00.793 --> 26:01.961
You are.

26:12.639 --> 26:14.373
Where's Jane?

26:14.406 --> 26:15.842
My sister, Jane?

26:15.875 --> 26:17.877
Yes, Ben.
Your sister Jane.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.845
I heard she
went home early.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.780
And right after I had
that talk with her.

26:20.813 --> 26:21.914
Did you know about this?

26:21.948 --> 26:24.751
Yes. I am aware
of her departure.

26:24.784 --> 26:25.818
What'd she say?

26:25.852 --> 26:28.621
She said some things

26:29.121 --> 26:30.589
about cramps.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.158
Cramps.

26:32.191 --> 26:35.161
Cramps.
You know, lady stuff.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.830
I'm not that familiar
with lady stuff,

26:37.864 --> 26:40.032
so I'd really rather
not discuss it.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.034
Uh-huh.

26:49.909 --> 26:50.843
Hi, Billy.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.044
Hello, Miss Shaw.

26:52.078 --> 26:54.013
I heard Jane
went home. She okay?

26:54.046 --> 26:57.049
She'll be fine.
Just a cold.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.018
Is Mmm-hmm.ht?

26:59.051 --> 27:00.820
AYeah.?

27:01.888 --> 27:03.089
All right, peace.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.667
JANE: White chocolate
half-caff latte.
Your favorite.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.803
And I picked up
the tear sheets that
you wanted this morning.

27:16.836 --> 27:19.071
And I got you
a reservation
tomorrow night at Per Se.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.073
I thought you said
they were booked up
for the next two months.

27:21.107 --> 27:23.175
They are.
I pulled some strings.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.811
Well done, Jane.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.813
And I thought you might
like to take a look at these.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.014
Some sketches.

27:28.047 --> 27:31.217
Of mine.
Just some new ideas
for the accessories line.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.452
I'll take a look.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.087
Impressive.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.691
You're still here.

27:38.725 --> 27:41.761
Yeah, Gray said I should
stick around a while
and check out the place.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.029
Is that right?

27:43.996 --> 27:45.097
It is.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.733
That's nice.

27:54.774 --> 27:55.942
Hey.

27:55.975 --> 27:56.909
Hello, Jane.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.244
Can I ask you a question?

27:58.277 --> 27:59.979
You What?did.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.848
You asked
if you could
ask me something.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.215
Technically,
that is a question.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.184
Sometimes you are
way too British.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.853
There's no such thing.

28:06.886 --> 28:09.121
Okay, come on,
I'm serious, Jeremy.

28:09.155 --> 28:11.157
At your service,
Miss Quimby.

28:11.190 --> 28:14.493
Okay, so about this
whole job offer thing.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.495
Do you really think
it's a good idea?

28:16.528 --> 28:17.897
In what respect?

28:17.930 --> 28:19.966
Well, in that
I'm an assistant.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.868
And the closest I've come
to studying design is,

28:21.901 --> 28:24.003
I don't know,
the endless hours I spent

28:24.036 --> 28:26.005
poring over theversastyle.com

28:26.038 --> 28:27.807
and fashion magazines
every weekend.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.876
This is a huge job.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.911
Why would Gray
trust me to handle
something like this?

28:31.944 --> 28:33.145
Because you can.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.882
Eli seems way more
qualified and he's...

28:35.915 --> 28:37.884
He's nothing
to worry about.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.919
You have to run
your own race, Jane.

28:39.952 --> 28:42.221
And you, you've got
what it takes.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.490
You really think so?

28:44.523 --> 28:46.192
I know so.
Plus, you deserve it.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.294
Thank you.

28:48.327 --> 28:51.297
I just really don't know
if this is the right thing
for me right now.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.799
Are you insane?

28:52.832 --> 28:55.034
I have a lot of stuff
going on at home.

28:55.067 --> 28:58.204
My best friend
was away for a while
and now he's back and...

28:58.237 --> 29:01.774
Is this the same friend
from the fashion show?

29:01.808 --> 29:04.176
Isn't he the reason
you turned me down?

29:05.344 --> 29:07.279
Jeremy,
we've talked about this.

29:07.313 --> 29:10.783
You're my mentor
and my friend.

29:10.817 --> 29:13.019
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No need to rub it in.

29:13.052 --> 29:17.323
All I'm saying is
I don't know if it's the
right time to leave him...

29:17.356 --> 29:19.191
To leave him behind.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.895
That is why
he was so upset.

29:22.929 --> 29:25.564
I'm not really following
your chain of thought here.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.967
Oh, it's nothing. Sorry.

29:32.104 --> 29:35.107
Thank you.
Thank you for all your help.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.111
You're welcome.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.827
Sup?

29:56.028 --> 29:59.832
* Come on, get in
Get out, go around

29:59.866 --> 30:01.300
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

30:03.002 --> 30:06.038
* So much for love
It turns to dust

30:06.072 --> 30:09.375
* And blows away
And it's not okay

30:09.408 --> 30:14.280
* So come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, let it go

30:16.615 --> 30:21.387
* So come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, let it go *

30:32.131 --> 30:36.903
One one thousand,
two one thousand,
three one thousand...

30:36.936 --> 30:39.138
What's going on with you?

30:39.171 --> 30:40.106
I was parched.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.207
You're avoiding me.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.275
What are you talking about?

30:43.309 --> 30:45.144
I'm trying to keep
things discreet.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.412
Between us. You know?

30:46.445 --> 30:48.014
You're lying
to me about Jane.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.215
What? No.

30:49.248 --> 30:50.349
Billy said she has a cold.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.118
You said she had cramps.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.419
Did not.
I have to go.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.021
Go where?

30:55.054 --> 30:58.157
I have to go
to the house
to check on Jane.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.927
You've got me
really worried about
these cold cramps.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.129
That's a great idea.
I'm going with you.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.396
And if Jane isn't
home sick in bed,

31:04.430 --> 31:07.066
that internship
of hers is over.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.947
You have to get
JWhat happened?

31:20.980 --> 31:23.449
The collective
brain power of you and me.
That's what happened.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.017
You said cramps,
didn't you?

31:25.051 --> 31:27.286
There's no time for blame.
Yes. I said cramps.

31:27.319 --> 31:29.188
You just couldn't stay
out of it, could you?

31:29.221 --> 31:31.057
I told Rita that
I was going home
to check on Jane,

31:31.090 --> 31:32.058
and now she's
coming with me.

31:32.091 --> 31:35.194
So Jane has to be home,
in bed, sick, and fast.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.064
I thought we were
staying out of it.
Can't you just call her?

31:38.097 --> 31:40.332
I've called her
like a dozen times.
It keeps going to voicemail.

31:40.366 --> 31:43.936
Ben, it's just the whole
racing to save Jane thing,

31:43.970 --> 31:46.305
it's not really
my problem anymore.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.374
Look. I'm not happy
about this either,

31:48.407 --> 31:51.377
and I know you two are
going through some sort of
weird time right now,

31:51.410 --> 31:53.312
but she needs us.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.914
Otherwise this whole
fashion dream thing
of hers is out the window.

31:57.283 --> 31:58.684
She's my sister.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.486
I can't bring myself
to do that to her. Can you?

32:07.193 --> 32:09.128
I can't compete
with this guy.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.097
Trust me. She's not
going to hire her nephew.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.364
You sure about that?

32:12.398 --> 32:15.001
Look, I didn't go
to school for design.

32:15.034 --> 32:18.270
And I know my technique
isn't exactly refined

32:18.304 --> 32:20.406
like the rest of you
extremely talented people.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.374
But, given the chance,
I might be able to bring

32:22.408 --> 32:24.376
something new
to the table here
at Donovan Decker.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.345
Something different.
Something fresh.

32:26.378 --> 32:29.982
Now I heard that you're
already selling your own
line, is that true?

32:30.016 --> 32:31.550
I do what I can.

32:31.583 --> 32:34.453
Mostly, right now I'm just
selling my stuff at pop-up
shops or on the street.

32:34.486 --> 32:37.256
Honestly, the money
I make barely
covers materials,

32:37.289 --> 32:39.225
but I love it.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.492
And that's what
it's all about.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.728
Yeah, I think so,
too, Carter.

32:42.761 --> 32:45.331
Are you listening
to this? He's perfect.

32:45.364 --> 32:48.400
He's charming and talented
and good-looking.

32:48.434 --> 32:49.735
He's not that
good-looking.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.003
I'm serious, Jeremy.

32:51.037 --> 32:53.139
There's no way
I actually have a chance
of getting this job.

32:53.172 --> 32:56.308
Not if I'm up against
a guy like that.
Which I am.

32:56.342 --> 32:59.278
Please.
It's a courtesy, Jane.
A family obligation.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.280
This is Gray
we're talking about.

33:01.313 --> 33:04.050
She's not going to actually
hire anyone she has to be
nice to.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.451
(CHUCKLES) Good point.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.987
You are probably right.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.457
Yeah, I'm always right.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.399
You said we were
leaving to check on Jane
20 minutes ago.

33:20.432 --> 33:23.135
And we are.
I just have to grade

33:23.169 --> 33:26.238
a few more
of these puppies
and we are on our way.

33:29.441 --> 33:32.178
Ten minutes, Ben.
And then we're going.
Understood?

33:33.079 --> 33:35.147
Understood.

33:35.181 --> 33:38.184
And if I find out
you are lying, we're gonna
have a serious issue.

33:47.326 --> 33:49.361
I'm pleased to announce

33:49.395 --> 33:51.430
that I have found
the perfect person

33:51.463 --> 33:53.832
to fill the vacancy
left by India Jourdain.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.401
ItWhat?u.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.469
I'm certain of it.

33:57.503 --> 34:02.441
GRAY: This person has proven
that they have exceptional
creativity and style.

34:02.474 --> 34:07.079
This person is destined
to be a rising star here
at Donovan Decker.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.484
This person is...

34:12.518 --> 34:14.186
Wait!

34:14.220 --> 34:15.354
What, Jane?

34:15.387 --> 34:17.356
I'm sorry. I just...

34:18.524 --> 34:19.525
I can't.

34:20.426 --> 34:21.527
Can't?

34:21.560 --> 34:24.096
I can't do this.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.664
I'd like to take myself
out of the running.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.434
I'm so sorry, Gray.

34:28.467 --> 34:31.437
I really am grateful.

34:31.470 --> 34:32.504
I just...

34:32.538 --> 34:34.506
I don't think
I'm ready for this.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.475
And I agree.

34:36.508 --> 34:39.478
Which is why
I'm pleased to introduce
our newest designer,

34:39.511 --> 34:40.546
Eli Chandler.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.227
Billy, what are you
doing here?

34:55.261 --> 34:56.628
We neWhat happened?home.

34:56.662 --> 34:58.464
What do you think
happened?

34:58.497 --> 34:59.731
Ben said cramps,
didn't he?

34:59.765 --> 35:01.667
Yeah. You know
your brother doesn't
think fast on his feet.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.602
This is true.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.103
And now Miss Shaw
is on her way to your house
to visit your sickbed.

35:05.137 --> 35:08.674
What do you think's faster
right now? 5th or Lex?
We're gonna have to...

35:08.707 --> 35:10.409
You came for me.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.611
I did.

35:12.644 --> 35:15.281
And I'm not
gonna let that be
for nothing. Come on.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.416
We have to
get you home. Now.

35:22.188 --> 35:23.555
Jane. I'm on my
way to the house.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.424
I've stalled
as long as I can

35:25.457 --> 35:28.260
and I just can't
keep lying to Rita.

35:28.294 --> 35:29.928
Your chariot awaits.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.164
Mmm-hmm.
Drive. Now.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.613
* Something that I never
thought would happen to me

35:47.646 --> 35:49.215
* I got love

35:50.716 --> 35:53.619
* Get it together!
Get it together!

35:56.388 --> 35:57.689
What was that for?

35:57.723 --> 35:59.525
No reason.

35:59.558 --> 36:02.461
* Let it go
Don't lose your patience

36:02.494 --> 36:05.764
* Oh, you never tried
to understand

36:07.766 --> 36:10.602
* Something that I never
thought would happen to me

36:10.636 --> 36:12.204
* (SQUEALS) ve

36:12.238 --> 36:13.472
Oh, this iOh! shortcut.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.342
* Get it together
Get it together

36:19.345 --> 36:22.214
* Take me back up
to the spaceship

36:22.248 --> 36:24.650
* Let it go
Don't lose your patience

36:24.683 --> 36:28.487
* Oh, you never tried
to understand

36:33.492 --> 36:36.262
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

36:36.295 --> 36:39.231
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

36:39.265 --> 36:41.633
* Something that I never
thought would happen to me

36:41.667 --> 36:42.668
* I got love

36:44.736 --> 36:48.374
* Nobody told you
Nobody told you, no

36:49.275 --> 36:50.742
Come on, Janey!

36:50.776 --> 36:52.411
(SCREAMS)

36:52.444 --> 36:54.246
(EXCLAIMING)

36:56.014 --> 36:58.784
* Take me back up
to the spaceship

36:58.817 --> 37:01.653
* Let it go
Don't lose your patience

37:01.687 --> 37:05.391
* Oh, I never tried
to understand *

37:13.365 --> 37:15.233
Oh, wait. Pajamas!

37:21.072 --> 37:22.308
Jane?

37:28.447 --> 37:29.715
Jane?

37:30.616 --> 37:31.783
Are you feeling okay?

37:37.389 --> 37:39.825
Maybe we should just
let her sleep a little bit.

37:39.858 --> 37:42.561
Wait a minute.
What is going on here?

37:47.599 --> 37:48.867
Oh, hey guys.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.803
I'm feeling much...

37:51.837 --> 37:53.605
(COUGHS) Much better.

37:53.639 --> 37:56.842
I just have a cold.
(COUGHING)

37:56.875 --> 38:00.078
And cramps.
So I just needed to...

38:00.111 --> 38:01.847
Double whammy.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.750
Hmm. Well, feel
better, okay, Jane?

38:04.783 --> 38:06.352
Thanks, Miss Shaw.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.060
(SIGHS)

38:15.093 --> 38:17.329
I'mFor what?en.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.765
For the whole
manhunt thing.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.334
Coming down on you.
Honestly,

38:22.368 --> 38:24.102
I feel terrible
for questioning you,

38:24.135 --> 38:25.471
accusing you of lying.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.373
I don't know
what got into me.

38:27.406 --> 38:30.876
I think you're just being
the best guidance counselor

38:30.909 --> 38:33.712
in the history of guidance
counselors, that's all.

38:33.745 --> 38:34.880
Thank you.

38:43.522 --> 38:44.890
(CHUCKLING)

38:47.693 --> 38:50.462
That was far,
far too close.

38:50.496 --> 38:51.897
Tell me about it.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.666
Oh, my gosh.
And how about me
turning down that job

38:54.700 --> 38:57.369
that I wasn't
even being offered?

38:57.403 --> 38:58.904
So embarrassing.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.907
It wasn't so bad.

39:01.940 --> 39:06.778
(CHUCKLES) Okay,
it was pretty bad.

39:06.812 --> 39:10.382
I counted
eight people cringing.

39:10.416 --> 39:11.583
Did you count me?

39:11.617 --> 39:13.585
(CHUCKLES) Okay. Nine.

39:15.487 --> 39:18.690
I know
you wanted that job.

39:18.724 --> 39:23.895
Honestly, I wasn't ready
to leave being a teenager
behind just yet.

39:23.929 --> 39:28.734
And I am definitely
not ready to leave you.

39:31.570 --> 39:36.374
Two months away.
It was a long time, Billy.

39:37.443 --> 39:38.610
I missed you.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.479
I missed you, too, Janey.

39:41.547 --> 39:43.949
Being away was

39:43.982 --> 39:46.785
terrible and lonely.

39:50.689 --> 39:53.191
But knowing
you'd be here waiting

39:53.224 --> 39:54.993
was the only thing
that got me through.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.432
I have to ask you...

40:02.000 --> 40:05.403
You said, "It's you,"

40:06.972 --> 40:08.974
and I need
to know if you meant...

40:09.007 --> 40:10.509
I meant

40:13.879 --> 40:15.781
that it's you, Janey.

40:17.516 --> 40:18.984
You

40:20.218 --> 40:21.853
are my best friend.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.994
The very best.

40:29.027 --> 40:31.029
And I don't want
that to ever change.

40:38.504 --> 40:41.540
Because that's what's
most important, right?

40:42.908 --> 40:45.844
Yeah. It is.

41:01.059 --> 41:06.865
Remember. We must
impress this Harrods
style director at any cost.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.500
Donovan is depending on us.

41:12.037 --> 41:15.273
Hello, losers.

41:15.306 --> 41:18.677
That's right.
I'm the one you've
been waiting for.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.246
Where's Jane?

41:21.279 --> 41:23.481
I can't wait to catch up.
