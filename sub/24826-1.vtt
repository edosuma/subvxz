IN NEW YORK,

15:58.297 --> 15:59.596
AT THAT BIG, PROMINENT FIRM.

15:59.631 --> 16:01.898
YES, YES,
WHERE WE ACTUALLY MADE MONEY.

16:01.933 --> 16:03.099
OOH, ISN'T THAT AWFUL?

16:03.134 --> 16:07.337
YOU SHOULD SEE HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT THE WAY WE DO THINGS.

16:07.372 --> 16:09.872
NOW, THERE'S A WOMAN
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

16:10.975 --> 16:12.041
IT'S A PRO BONO CASE.

16:12.077 --> 16:13.243
PRO BONO?

16:13.278 --> 16:14.277
YES.

16:14.313 --> 16:15.579
FOR NOTHING?

16:15.614 --> 16:17.681
FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD.

16:17.716 --> 16:19.882
SHE WANTS
TO SUE A CLIENT OF OURS,

16:19.918 --> 16:21.518
AND OUR CLIENT CAN'T PAY,

16:21.553 --> 16:24.053
SO...
WE COULD DO IT FOR FREE.

16:24.089 --> 16:25.154
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:29.127 --> 16:30.660
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

16:32.431 --> 16:34.931
YOU DON'T THINK I'LL DO IT.

16:34.966 --> 16:37.133
YOU WANT TO BE PROVEN RIGHT
ABOUT ME.

16:37.168 --> 16:38.201
I DON'T...

16:38.237 --> 16:39.402
WELL, I'LL DO IT.

16:39.438 --> 16:40.370
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

16:40.405 --> 16:41.738
I'M PLEASED.

16:41.773 --> 16:43.540
YEAH, YOU SAY YOU'RE PLEASED,

16:43.575 --> 16:45.542
BUT I KNOW THAT INSIDE,
YOU ARE SHOCKED.

16:45.577 --> 16:48.612
YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT,
IF YOU WANT TO.

16:48.647 --> 16:49.912
I AM GOING
TO TAKE THIS PRO BONO CASE,

16:49.948 --> 16:52.215
AND I'M GOING TO SLAY IT...

16:52.251 --> 16:54.050
YEAH, AND THEN
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FEEL?

16:54.085 --> 16:56.052
HAPPY?

16:56.087 --> 16:57.721
- YOU'RE DARN RIGHT.
- OKAY.

16:57.756 --> 16:58.722
LEAD ON.

16:58.757 --> 16:59.756
GREAT.

17:01.993 --> 17:04.594
I THINK THEY MANUFACTURE IT
RIGHT IN THEIR HOUSE

17:04.630 --> 17:07.297
AND SELL ON THE FRONT LAWN,
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY!

17:07.332 --> 17:08.765
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS!

17:08.800 --> 17:09.766
MRS. BELLAMY...

17:09.800 --> 17:10.700
I HATE TO THINK

17:10.736 --> 17:11.434
WHAT KIND OF HEALTH CODES
THEY'RE VIOLATING,

17:11.470 --> 17:13.102
NOT TO MENTION
THE ZONING CODES.

17:13.137 --> 17:14.671
MRS...

17:14.705 --> 17:17.473
AND HE HAS HIS GRANDDAUGHTER
SELLING THE STUFF.

17:17.509 --> 17:19.276
WHAT KIND OF MONSTER
WOULD DO THAT?

17:19.310 --> 17:20.843
MRS. BELLAMY,
YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME

17:20.878 --> 17:23.246
WHAT MY CLIENTS
ARE ALLEGEDLY SELLING.

17:23.281 --> 17:25.114
ALLEGEDLY?

17:25.150 --> 17:26.915
I'VE GOT PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE.

17:35.126 --> 17:37.093
IT'S A LEMONADE STAND.

17:37.128 --> 17:38.595
YOU SEE?

17:38.630 --> 17:40.297
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER,
CAN YOU?

17:40.332 --> 17:43.667
NO, NO, I CAN'T.

17:47.038 --> 17:49.038
OKAY, HERE YOU GO.

17:49.073 --> 17:50.840
WELL, SHE'S
A REAL WING-NUT,

17:50.875 --> 17:52.542
BUT THE THING IS,
SHE'S RIGHT.

17:52.577 --> 17:54.711
HER NEIGHBORHOOD
ISN'T ZONED FOR RETAIL,

17:54.746 --> 17:57.714
SO TECHNICALLY,
SHE HAS A CASE.

17:57.749 --> 17:59.015
SO IT'LL TAKE
A REALLY GOOD LAWYER

17:59.050 --> 18:00.116
TO FIGHT IT, HUH?

18:00.151 --> 18:01.384
YOU REALLY THINK

18:01.420 --> 18:02.952
THAT FLATTERY
WILL MOTIVATE ME?

18:02.987 --> 18:03.720
WON'T IT?

18:03.755 --> 18:06.690
WELL, YES,
OF COURSE, IT WILL.

18:06.725 --> 18:07.657
I'M SURPRISED
IT TOOK YOU THAT LONG

18:07.693 --> 18:09.025
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

18:09.060 --> 18:10.327
[MILES]: HEY.

18:10.362 --> 18:12.562
- HEY THERE. HOW ARE YOU?
- HI!

18:12.597 --> 18:13.296
LOOK WHAT I GOT...
THE CONTRACT!

18:13.332 --> 18:14.631
OH, GOOD,
YOU GOT THE CONTRACT.

18:14.666 --> 18:15.665
THE CONTRACT.

18:15.701 --> 18:16.833
I PICKED IT UP
FROM TERRY'S OFFICE LAST NIGHT.

18:16.868 --> 18:17.834
AWESOME.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

18:17.869 --> 18:19.569
ALL RIGHT.

18:19.604 --> 18:20.804
ARE YOU PHOEBE
STRASBERG?

18:20.839 --> 18:22.872
UH... YES?

18:22.907 --> 18:24.674
YOUR ROOMMATE TOLD US
WE MIGHT FIND YOU HERE.

18:24.710 --> 18:25.908
WAIT. HOLD ON.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:25.944 --> 18:27.544
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST,
MISS STRASBERG.

18:27.579 --> 18:29.178
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:29.214 --> 18:30.680
WHAT IS SHE BEING CHARGED WITH?

18:30.716 --> 18:32.682
THE MURDER OF
TERRY YASBECK.

18:32.718 --> 18:33.983
[MILES]:
MURDER? WHAT?

18:34.018 --> 18:35.719
- TERRY?
- THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

18:35.754 --> 18:36.720
[OFFICER]: YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

18:36.755 --> 18:38.988
ANYTHING YOU SAY
CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

18:39.023 --> 18:39.823
IN A COURT OF LAW.

18:39.858 --> 18:41.658
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

18:41.693 --> 18:43.226
IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD
AN ATTORNEY,

18:43.261 --> 18:43.993
ONE WILL BE PROVIDED FOR YOU.

18:44.028 --> 18:45.829
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THESE RIGHTS?

18:45.864 --> 18:46.863
[MILES]: DON'T WORRY, PHOEBE,
WE'VE GOT THIS.

19:05.902 --> 19:07.568
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
I'M THE ONE YOU NEED.

19:07.603 --> 19:08.569
YOU ARE.

19:08.604 --> 19:10.538
I HAVE NEVER DEFENDED
A MURDER TRIAL BEFORE.

19:10.573 --> 19:12.406
ISN'T THERE SOMEONE
MORE QUALIFIED THAN ME?

19:12.441 --> 19:15.108
YOU'RE THE BEST TRIAL LAWYER
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

19:15.144 --> 19:15.876
WELL, THANK YOU,
BUT STILL...

19:15.912 --> 19:16.844
SO HERE'S WHAT
YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

19:16.879 --> 19:18.478
SHE WAS SEEN ENTERING
THE YASBECKS' OFFICE

19:18.514 --> 19:19.479
AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER.

19:19.515 --> 19:20.480
THEY GOT A SEARCH WARRANT.

19:20.516 --> 19:21.916
THEY SEARCHED HER CAR.

19:21.951 --> 19:23.551
THEY FOUND THE MURDER WEAPON.

19:23.586 --> 19:24.718
A BERETTA M9.

19:24.754 --> 19:26.286
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE SO SURE
IT'S HER?

19:26.321 --> 19:27.454
THAT'S WHY
THEY'RE SO SURE.

19:27.489 --> 19:29.590
THEY'RE TESTING HER HANDS
FOR GUNSHOT RESIDUE RIGHT NOW.

19:30.960 --> 19:31.859
LOOK, CLAIRE...

19:33.462 --> 19:34.461
I KNOW MY SISTER.

19:34.496 --> 19:36.864
I KNOW
SHE'S INNOCENT.

19:38.801 --> 19:40.868
YOU'RE GOOD AT DEFENDING
THE INNOCENT, RIGHT?

19:43.205 --> 19:44.404
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE HER THIS AFTERNOON.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.306
THANK YOU.

19:46.341 --> 19:48.108
AFTER I CHECK ON LOU.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.310
THANK YOU.

20:00.990 --> 20:02.690
SO YOU THINK YOU'RE
UP FOR THIS CASE?

20:02.725 --> 20:04.424
NOT REALLY.

20:04.460 --> 20:06.126
I DO.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.761
HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:07.797 --> 20:09.129
[CRACKING]

20:09.164 --> 20:10.297
[JOANNA]:
SHE IS GOOD.

20:10.332 --> 20:11.231
I MEAN, SHE'S
REALLY GOOD.

20:11.266 --> 20:13.133
I KNOW! HER DAD TAUGHT
HER TO HIT LIKE THAT.

20:13.168 --> 20:16.136
OH, NOW I SEE.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.671
SO BASEBALL
IS LOU'S WAY

20:17.707 --> 20:18.973
OF STAYING CONNECTED

20:19.008 --> 20:19.974
TO THE MEMORY
OF HER FATHER.

20:20.009 --> 20:21.642
THAT'S NICE.

20:21.677 --> 20:22.810
YEAH.

20:22.845 --> 20:23.944
WHEN SHE WAS FOUR,

20:23.980 --> 20:25.946
SHE COULD NAME
EVERY BASEBALL TEAM

20:25.982 --> 20:27.447
AND EVERY CITY
IN THE MAJOR LEAGUE.

20:27.483 --> 20:28.448
SHE COLLECTED THE CARDS.

20:28.484 --> 20:29.850
SHE KNEW ALL THE STATS.

20:29.885 --> 20:31.351
THE STATS?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

20:31.386 --> 20:33.153
YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S
HOW SHE GOT INTO MATH,

20:33.188 --> 20:34.521
WHICH LEAD TO ENGINEERING,

20:34.556 --> 20:36.991
WHICH LEAD
TO ALL THE A.P. CLASSES.

20:37.026 --> 20:38.492
WE OWE IT ALL
TO BASEBALL.

20:38.527 --> 20:39.893
WELL...

20:39.929 --> 20:41.461
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST A BUNCH OF GUYS

20:41.497 --> 20:42.496
STANDING AROUND,

20:42.531 --> 20:44.564
WAITING FOR FLY BALLS.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.566
THERE'S A LOT MORE TO IT
THAN THAT.

20:46.602 --> 20:47.901
YEAH, UH, COULD'VE
FOOLED ME.

20:47.937 --> 20:49.003
LOU.

20:49.038 --> 20:50.638
SHE YOURS?

20:50.673 --> 20:52.305
UM...

20:52.341 --> 20:53.240
YES.

20:53.275 --> 20:54.241
NOT BAD.

20:54.276 --> 20:55.375
NOT BAD?

20:55.410 --> 20:56.510
SHE'S THE BEST
PLAYER YOU'VE GOT.

20:56.545 --> 20:58.278
OH, YEAH?

21:01.250 --> 21:02.149
CHARMING FELLOW.

21:02.184 --> 21:04.652
BYE.

21:04.687 --> 21:06.687
[SNICKERING]

21:06.722 --> 21:08.022
ALL RIGHT.

21:08.057 --> 21:09.322
I'VE GOT TO GO.

21:09.358 --> 21:10.390
WISH ME LUCK.

21:10.425 --> 21:11.725
ALL RIGHT.
GO GET 'EM, TIGER.

21:20.903 --> 21:22.936
YES, I FOUGHT WITH TERRY
DURING OUR LAST SESSION,

21:22.972 --> 21:24.838
AND YEAH, I HAD
A DIFFERENT PRODUCER LINED UP.

21:24.874 --> 21:26.940
DID YOU THREATEN
TERRY YASBECK?

21:26.976 --> 21:28.575
I DON'T KNOW.
I MIGHT HAVE.

21:28.610 --> 21:30.911
I MEAN....
I WAS MAD.

21:30.946 --> 21:33.613
TERRY HAS A WAY
OF GETTING UNDER YOUR SKIN...

21:33.649 --> 21:35.382
OR... HAD.

21:35.417 --> 21:37.084
WELL, YOU WERE OVERHEARD

21:37.119 --> 21:38.719
THREATENING TERRY

21:38.754 --> 21:40.554
IF HE DESTROYED YOUR ALBUM.

21:40.589 --> 21:42.422
YEAH, I MEAN, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE SOMETHING I'D SAY.

21:42.457 --> 21:43.456
I MEAN,
SUPPOSE SOMEBODY THREATENED

21:43.492 --> 21:44.858
WHATEVER YOU CARE
ABOUT MOST?

21:44.894 --> 21:46.393
OKAY...
THE CLERK

21:46.428 --> 21:47.895
AT THE CONVENIENCE STORE
ACROSS THE STREET

21:47.930 --> 21:49.462
SAID HE SAW YOU TRYING THE DOOR
TO YASBECKS' STUDIO

21:49.498 --> 21:51.398
AROUND 1:00 IN THE MORNING.

21:51.433 --> 21:52.399
SAID HE RECOGNIZED YOU.

21:52.434 --> 21:53.266
YEAH, I MEAN, I...

21:53.302 --> 21:55.202
WE ALWAYS BUY ENERGY DRINKS
FROM HIM.

21:55.237 --> 21:57.237
I WAVED AT HIM,

21:57.272 --> 21:59.439
AND THEN THE DOOR WAS LOCKED,
SO I WENT AROUND BACK.

21:59.474 --> 22:01.241
THE SECURITY CAMERA
SAW YOU DRIVE UP

22:01.276 --> 22:02.242
AND GO IN THE BACK DOOR.

22:02.277 --> 22:03.276
I KNOW.
I TOLD YOU.

22:03.312 --> 22:04.978
I WENT TO GO GET THE CONTRACT.

22:05.014 --> 22:06.479
SO THAT DOOR WAS UNLOCKED?

22:06.515 --> 22:08.248
YEAH,

22:08.283 --> 22:09.616
SO I THOUGHT SOMEBODY
WOULD BE WORKING THERE,

22:09.651 --> 22:12.119
BUT THE WHOLE PLACE
WAS JUST QUIET.

22:12.154 --> 22:13.821
TERRY WASN'T THERE.

22:13.856 --> 22:14.722
I MEAN, AT LEAST,
I DIDN'T SEE HIM.

22:16.992 --> 22:17.858
SO I WENT INTO HIS OFFICE,

22:17.893 --> 22:20.227
AND I GOT THE CONTRACT
FROM HIS FILES.

22:20.262 --> 22:21.762
I EVEN LOOKED
THROUGH HIS WHOLE COMPUTER.

22:21.797 --> 22:23.463
WHAT FOR?

22:23.498 --> 22:24.397
FOR MY ALBUM,
FOR THE TRACKS.

22:24.433 --> 22:25.298
AH, OF COURSE.

22:25.334 --> 22:26.834
I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

22:26.869 --> 22:27.667
DID YOU HEAR A GUNSHOT?

22:27.703 --> 22:28.736
NO.

22:28.771 --> 22:29.803
[MILES]:
PHOEBE...

22:29.839 --> 22:31.605
YOU WERE THERE AT THE
EXACT TIME OF THE MURDER.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.173
AND TERRY'S WIFE SAID

22:33.209 --> 22:34.441
SHE HEARD HIM
CALL YOUR NAME

22:34.476 --> 22:35.776
ON THE PHONE.

22:35.811 --> 22:36.676
I MEAN, EVEN IF I WAS THERE,

22:36.712 --> 22:38.278
I WOULDN'T HAVE HEARD
THE SHOT ANYWAYS.

22:38.313 --> 22:39.146
THE WHOLE STUDIO'S SOUNDPROOFED.

22:41.217 --> 22:43.550
I SWEAR,
I JUST WENT HOME.

22:45.221 --> 22:46.286
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

22:46.321 --> 22:48.321
YOU'RE INNOCENT.

22:48.357 --> 22:49.823
YOU'RE INNOCENT.
THEY'LL SEE THAT.

22:49.859 --> 22:52.159
IT'S FUNNY,
YOU KNOW.

22:52.194 --> 22:53.761
LAST NIGHT,

22:53.796 --> 22:55.362
THAT ALBUM WAS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD

22:55.397 --> 22:57.097
TO ME...

22:57.133 --> 22:58.866
AND NOW,
I MEAN...

22:58.901 --> 23:01.135
I CAN ALWAYS JUST RE-MAKE IT...

23:01.170 --> 23:03.203
UNLESS I'M IN PRISON
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

23:03.239 --> 23:04.872
I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT I'M FACING, RIGHT?

23:04.907 --> 23:05.973
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

23:06.008 --> 23:07.074
OKAY?

23:08.477 --> 23:09.810
AH.

23:09.845 --> 23:11.044
ARE YOU READY
TO PLEAD GUILTY?

23:11.080 --> 23:12.512
NO, I DIDN'T KILL TERRY.

23:12.547 --> 23:14.381
SHE DIDN'T
KILL TERRY.

23:14.416 --> 23:15.615
DISTRICT ATTORNEY
ASHLAND, HOW ARE YOU?

23:15.651 --> 23:17.617
NOT TOO HAPPY TO SEE YOU ON
THIS SIDE OF THE FENCE, MILES.

23:17.653 --> 23:19.820
[CLAIRE]:
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME SIDE.

23:19.855 --> 23:21.621
WE ALL WANT TO FIND THE TRUTH.

23:21.657 --> 23:23.891
MAN, YOU WEREN'T KIDDING
ABOUT HER, WERE YOU?

23:23.926 --> 23:25.159
WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT ME?

23:25.194 --> 23:26.326
I SAID NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS.

23:26.361 --> 23:27.394
PLUS, SHE'S RIGHT.

23:27.429 --> 23:28.996
I DON'T KNOW.

23:30.565 --> 23:32.866
WE HAVE THE RESULTS
OF THE GUNSHOT RESIDUE TEST

23:32.902 --> 23:34.134
ON THE SUSPECT'S HANDS.

23:36.672 --> 23:37.871
IT CAME BACK POSITIVE.

23:44.446 --> 23:46.914
[CLAPPING]

23:46.949 --> 23:47.714

THAT'S IT, FELLAS!

23:47.749 --> 23:50.217
COME ON, WAKE UP!
WAKE UP OUT THERE!

23:50.252 --> 23:51.051
WHY ISN'T HE
PLAYING HER?

23:51.086 --> 23:53.120
LOOK AT HER.
SHE'S SO DISAPPOINTED.

23:56.058 --> 23:56.890
WAIT, WAIT A SECOND.

23:56.926 --> 23:58.992
I THINK HE'S GOING
TO GO TALK TO HER.

23:59.028 --> 24:00.828
- OKAY. OH, I'M SO NERVOUS.
- HE'S TALKING TO HER.

24:00.863 --> 24:01.829
- [CLAIRE]: I'M SO NERVOUS.
- [JOANNA]: IT'S OKAY.

24:01.864 --> 24:02.629
I MEAN, SHE'S
GOOD, RIGHT?

24:02.664 --> 24:04.764
YEAH, BUT THIS IS
A LOT OF PRESSURE.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.499
OH, YOU MEAN LIKE
YOU WITH THAT CASE?

24:06.535 --> 24:08.001
YOU'RE NOT HELPING.

24:08.037 --> 24:09.837
SORRY.

24:11.540 --> 24:13.773
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE GOOD, YOU'RE GOOD.

24:13.809 --> 24:15.508
OH, ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?

24:15.544 --> 24:16.910
COACH, PUT HER IN!

24:16.946 --> 24:18.846
[COACH]: COME ON, FELLAS!
HUSTLE UP, KEEP ALERT.

24:18.881 --> 24:20.747
JERK.

24:20.782 --> 24:22.216
[CLAPPING]

24:27.156 --> 24:28.455
HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE

24:28.490 --> 24:29.356
TO TRACK THE SERIAL
NUMBER ON THE GUN?

24:29.391 --> 24:30.457
THEY HAVE.

24:30.492 --> 24:32.926
IT BELONGS TO
A CATHERINE HUDDLESTON.

24:32.962 --> 24:34.027
SHE'S AN OLD-TIMER,

24:34.063 --> 24:35.062
LIVES OUT THERE
ON QUANDER ROAD.

24:35.097 --> 24:37.064
SAYS SHE CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME SHE SAW IT.

24:37.099 --> 24:39.066
BUT SHE HAS NO
CONNECTION TO YOUR SISTER?

24:39.101 --> 24:40.067
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

24:40.102 --> 24:41.068
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING.

24:41.103 --> 24:42.435
[PHONE RINGING]

24:42.471 --> 24:43.270
[SCOTT]:
HELLO?

24:43.305 --> 24:44.437
[CLAIRE, ON PHONE]:
<i>SCOTT?</i>

24:44.473 --> 24:45.538
YES, CHIEF.

24:45.574 --> 24:47.774
HEY, I NEED YOU
TO TRACK A...

24:47.809 --> 24:48.976
CATHERINE HUDDLESTON.

24:49.011 --> 24:50.010
A CATHERINE
HUDDLESTON.

24:50.045 --> 24:51.611
- FIND OUT EVERYTHING YOU CAN--
- TERRY YASBECK.

24:51.646 --> 24:52.779
AND SEE ABOUT
HER CONNECTION

24:52.814 --> 24:54.281
TO TERRY YASBECK

24:54.316 --> 24:55.815
OR ANYONE ELSE
INVOLVED IN THE CASE.

24:55.851 --> 24:57.717
YOU GOT IT.

24:57.753 --> 24:58.651
HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

24:58.687 --> 24:59.652
YEAH?

24:59.688 --> 25:01.054
SO PHOEBE'S ALBUM,
ALL RIGHT,

25:01.090 --> 25:02.389
THE TRACKS,
PHOEBE'S ALBUM...

25:02.424 --> 25:04.391
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
AT TERRY YASBECK'S STUDIO,

25:04.426 --> 25:05.625
AND APPARENTLY,
THIS GUY KEPT EVERYTHING,

25:05.660 --> 25:06.960
WAS A REAL
CONTROL FREAK, RIGHT?

25:06.996 --> 25:08.262
HE HAD BACK-UPS
ON BACK-UPS,

25:08.297 --> 25:09.329
AND EVERYTHING
THEY DID

25:09.365 --> 25:10.330
ON THE COMPUTERS
OVER THERE,

25:10.366 --> 25:11.564
HE DIDN'T LET GO
OF ANYTHING.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.233
SO WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE ALBUM?

25:13.269 --> 25:15.435
I DON'T KNOW, I...

25:15.470 --> 25:17.470
EITHER TERRY DESTROYED IT,
WHICH MAKES NO SENSE, OR...

25:17.506 --> 25:18.805
SOMEBODY STOLE IT.

25:18.840 --> 25:19.839
OR SOMEONE STOLE IT.

25:19.875 --> 25:20.774
VERY POSSIBLY
THE SAME PERSON

25:20.809 --> 25:21.841
THAT KILLED TERRY.

25:21.877 --> 25:22.776
BUT WHY WOULD
THEY DO THAT?

25:22.811 --> 25:23.810
IT DOESN'T...

25:23.845 --> 25:25.645
IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING
TO ANYBODY BUT TERRY.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.147
AND PHOEBE.

25:27.182 --> 25:28.115
SHE SAYS SHE
DIDN'T TAKE IT.

25:28.150 --> 25:29.182
SHE ALSO SAID

25:29.218 --> 25:29.983
SHE DIDN'T KILL
TERRY YASBECK.

25:30.019 --> 25:33.287
I KNOW...
I KNOW SHE DIDN'T, BUT...

25:33.322 --> 25:34.621
IF I'M A D.A., WHICH I AM,

25:34.656 --> 25:37.090
AND I'M THINKING LIKE A D.A.,
WHICH I AM,

25:37.126 --> 25:38.025
SHE LOOKS GUILTY.

25:38.060 --> 25:39.993
WELL, I'M THINKING
LIKE A DEFENSE ATTORNEY,

25:40.029 --> 25:41.094
AND I KNOW SHE'S NOT.

25:41.130 --> 25:43.863
THANKS FOR SAYING THAT,
AND ALSO, THANK YOU FOR...

25:43.899 --> 25:45.332
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

25:45.367 --> 25:46.300
ALL RIGHT.

25:58.424 --> 26:00.057
AND DON'T YOU FRET.

26:00.093 --> 26:01.559
I'M GOING TO TAKE
CARE OF THIS, OKAY?

26:01.594 --> 26:02.560
OKAY.

26:02.595 --> 26:04.295
OKAY.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.563
THANK YOU, MRS. DARROW.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.030
MM-HMM.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.103
YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES
THIS LEMONADE CASE SO HARD?

26:12.138 --> 26:13.737
HAVING TO WATCH A LITTLE GIRL
SOB HER EYES OUT?

26:13.772 --> 26:15.272
WELL, YEAH, THAT,

26:15.308 --> 26:16.773
AND HAVING
TO ACTUALLY TASTE THE LEMONADE.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.610
THEY SWEETEN IT WITH STEVIA.

26:19.645 --> 26:21.145
IT'S A TERRIBLE AFTER-TASTE.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.146
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LIKE STEVIA.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.614
HUH.

26:23.649 --> 26:25.282
YOU PROBABLY LIKE CILANTRO, TOO.

26:25.318 --> 26:26.484
YES, I DO.

26:26.519 --> 26:28.752
WELL, TAKES ALL KINDS.

26:30.456 --> 26:31.489
HEY, WHERE'S CLAIRE?

26:31.524 --> 26:33.424
SHE'S WITH MILES,
MEETING WITH PHOEBE'S PRODUCER.

26:34.793 --> 26:36.994
I... I THOUGHT
PHOEBE'S PRODUCER WAS DEAD.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.629
I MEAN,
ISN'T THAT THE WHOLE PROBLEM?

26:38.664 --> 26:39.796
THERE'S A NEW PRODUCER.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.499
OH.

26:41.534 --> 26:42.833
SHE HAS A NEW PRODUCER?

26:42.868 --> 26:44.602
WELL, LUCKY GIRL.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.670
EXCEPT FOR BEING CHARGED
WITH MURDER?

26:46.705 --> 26:48.439
WELL, YEAH,
EXCEPT FOR THAT.

26:49.342 --> 26:50.974
CHESTER LIME.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.809
I WAS WONDERING
IF TODAY WOULD BE A GOOD DAY

26:52.845 --> 26:54.811
TO DISCUSS OUR CREATIVE
SYNERGY EXPLORATION?

26:54.847 --> 26:56.013
[JOANNA AND RAYMOND]: NO.

26:58.351 --> 27:00.317
OH.

27:00.353 --> 27:01.685
OKAY.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.366
TERRY YASBECK WAS
AN ABUSIVE JERK.

27:15.401 --> 27:16.634
ASK ANYBODY.

27:16.669 --> 27:17.401
EMOTIONALLY,
PHYSICALLY...

27:17.436 --> 27:18.569
I MEAN, IF PHOEBE
KILLED HIM,

27:18.604 --> 27:19.570
IT WAS IN SELF-DEFENSE.

27:19.605 --> 27:20.504
SHE DIDN'T KILL HIM.

27:21.707 --> 27:22.806
ARE YOU SAYING

27:22.841 --> 27:24.175
THAT THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK HAPPENED?

27:24.210 --> 27:25.342
NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

27:25.378 --> 27:28.312
I'M JUST SAYING TERRY
WAS AN ANGRY, DANGEROUS PERSON.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.480
I MEAN, IF I SAW HIM
COMING AT PHOEBE,

27:29.515 --> 27:30.648
AND I HAD A GUN,

27:30.683 --> 27:31.482
I'D PROBABLY SHOOT HIM MYSELF.

27:31.517 --> 27:32.550
DID YOU?

27:32.585 --> 27:34.185
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

27:36.189 --> 27:37.921
YOU SEEM AWFULLY PROTECTIVE
OF PHOEBE.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.590
LOOK, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.225
SHE'S A VERY TALENTED SINGER,

27:41.260 --> 27:42.759
AND I WANT TO
PRODUCE HER ALBUM.

27:42.795 --> 27:43.994
DID YOU SEND HER FLOWERS?

27:44.029 --> 27:45.529
YES, I DID,

27:45.565 --> 27:48.566
BUT JUST TO THANK HER
FOR SIGNING WITH ME.

27:48.601 --> 27:51.902
BUT YOU DO HAVE
A PARTICULAR REASON

27:51.937 --> 27:53.604
FOR WANTING TO KILL
TERRY YASBECK, DON'T YOU?

27:53.639 --> 27:55.872
YEAH, OKAY.
YOU'RE REFERRING TO LINDA.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.708
YEAH, TERRY WAS MARRIED
TO MY EX-WIFE.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.443
RIGHT, SO WE COULD SAY
YOU HAVE MANY REASONS

27:59.478 --> 28:00.711
TO WANT TO KILL TERRY YASBECK,
DON'T YOU?

28:05.718 --> 28:07.518
[CLAIRE]: WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE

28:07.553 --> 28:09.386
EVAN HAS MORE
THAN A PROFESSIONAL INTEREST

28:09.422 --> 28:10.721
IN YOUR SISTER.

28:10.756 --> 28:11.755
WHY DID YOU STOP ME?

28:11.790 --> 28:12.723
I HAD HIM
ON THE ROPES.

28:12.758 --> 28:13.757
WE'RE NOT IN COURT.

28:13.792 --> 28:14.391
WE'RE NOT EVEN
TAKING DEPOSITIONS.

28:14.427 --> 28:16.126
WE'RE JUST
GATHERING FACTS.

28:16.161 --> 28:17.127
AS A D.A.,
YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

28:17.162 --> 28:18.095
YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:18.130 --> 28:18.795
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:18.831 --> 28:20.564
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE
BLIND FAITH.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.565
IS THAT WHAT
YOU DO, CLAIRE?

28:21.601 --> 28:22.533
YOU JUST HAVE
BLIND FAITH?

28:22.568 --> 28:23.934
ACTUALLY, JUST FAITH,

28:23.969 --> 28:24.901
BUT YOU CAN CALL IT
BLIND JUSTICE.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.103
BESIDES, NOW WE KNOW

28:26.138 --> 28:27.738
EVAN CARLTON'S
IN LOVE WITH YOUR SISTER.

28:27.773 --> 28:29.139
ABOUT THAT...
IF HE IS,

28:29.174 --> 28:30.807
THEN WHY...

28:30.843 --> 28:31.908
DIDN'T PHOEBE TELL US THAT?

28:31.944 --> 28:34.111
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T KNOW...

28:34.146 --> 28:35.546
OR MAYBE SHE'S PROTECTING HIM.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.616
HEY, SCOTT,

28:38.651 --> 28:39.916
HOW ARE YOU COMING ALONG
WITH CATHERINE HUDDLESTON?

28:39.952 --> 28:40.884
STILL LOOKING INTO IT.

28:40.919 --> 28:41.985
OKAY, WELL,

28:42.020 --> 28:42.986
I'M GOING
TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER JOB

28:43.021 --> 28:44.054
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BEST
INVESTIGATOR I HAVE.

28:44.089 --> 28:46.957
I WON'T DENY THAT,
BUT THANKS FOR THE VALIDATION.

28:46.992 --> 28:48.459
I WANT YOU TO FIND OUT
WHAT CAN CAUSE A FALSE POSITIVE

28:48.494 --> 28:49.727
ON A GUNSHOT-RESIDUE TEST.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.828
RIGHT...
I'M ON IT.

28:51.864 --> 28:52.896
THAT'S GOOD.

28:52.931 --> 28:53.930
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.399
I HAVE THEM OCCASIONALLY.

28:55.434 --> 28:56.233
YEAH, DO THAT.

28:56.269 --> 28:57.067
I DON'T WORK FOR YOU.

28:57.102 --> 28:58.135
NOT YET.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.102
[CLAIRE]:
PLEASE, GUYS, OKAY?

28:59.138 --> 29:00.036
SO NOW WE NEED TO GO TALK

29:00.072 --> 29:01.805
TO PHOEBE'S BACK-UP SINGER
AND HER ENGINEER

29:01.840 --> 29:03.274
TO FIND OUT
MORE ABOUT THAT.

29:03.309 --> 29:04.174
I'LL BRING THE CAR ROUND.

29:04.209 --> 29:05.242
OKAY.

29:05.278 --> 29:06.677
HEY, CHESTER?

29:06.712 --> 29:08.178
YOU KNOW YOUR WAY
AROUND A COMPUTER, RIGHT?

29:08.213 --> 29:10.147
WE HAVE A CERTAIN RAPPORT.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.683
I WANT YOU TO SEARCH
TERRY YASBECK'S COMPUTER SYSTEM

29:12.718 --> 29:15.152
FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK
LEADING UP TO THE MURDER.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.787
THAT'LL TAKE DAYS,

29:16.822 --> 29:17.988
AND THE POLICE HAVE ALREADY
BEEN THROUGH IT.

29:18.023 --> 29:19.022
ARE YOU COMPLAINING?

29:19.057 --> 29:20.791
NO, JUST DEFINING IT.

29:20.826 --> 29:21.958
ACTUALLY, IT SOUNDS KIND OF FUN.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.427
GREAT, AND, CHESTER,

29:23.462 --> 29:24.561
I WANT YOU TO BE MY SECOND
ON THIS.

29:26.064 --> 29:27.631
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
I JUST...

29:27.667 --> 29:28.932
AH... MM.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.337
SCOTT!

29:33.372 --> 29:34.371
WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU

29:34.407 --> 29:35.639
ABOUT LEAVING
YOUR LAW BOOKS

29:35.675 --> 29:36.707
ALL OVER MY DESK?

29:36.742 --> 29:37.541
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOUR DESK?

29:37.576 --> 29:39.343
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO SHARE THIS DESK.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.178
THIS HALF IS MINE.

29:41.213 --> 29:43.781
WELL, THEN WHY DO YOU LEAVE
YOUR DANISH ON MY HALF?

29:43.816 --> 29:45.316
STOP BEING PETTY!

29:45.351 --> 29:46.183
YOU'RE BEING PETTY!

29:46.218 --> 29:48.385
THEY'RE LIKE THIS 24-7.

29:48.421 --> 29:51.455
MAYBE WE DO NEED
TEAM-BUILDING EXERCISES.

29:51.490 --> 29:54.458
JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES
STARTS WITH A SINGLE DANISH.

30:01.867 --> 30:04.635
NO, I DON'T HAVE
ANY OF PHOEBE'S TRACKS.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.002
TERRY WAS VERY
PROTECTIVE OF THEM.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.304
HE KEPT THEM ALL
ON HIS COMPUTER.

30:07.340 --> 30:09.239
THEY AREN'T ON ANY
OF TERRY'S COMPUTERS.

30:09.274 --> 30:11.642
OR ON THE HARD DRIVE
AT THE RECORDING STUDIO.

30:11.677 --> 30:14.478
OH, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT...

30:14.513 --> 30:16.847
YOU KNOW, UNLESS TERRY WAS GOING
TO DELETE THE WHOLE ALBUM.

30:16.882 --> 30:19.015
[NORAH]: WELL, I WOULDN'T PUT
IT PAST HIM.

30:19.051 --> 30:22.386
HE ERASED ALL THE MUSIC
I RECORDED WITH HIM.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.187
HE WAS JEALOUS OF MY TALENT.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.922
THIS IS MY WIFE, NORAH.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.424
SHE'S ALSO THE BACK-UP
SINGER ON PHOEBE'S ALBUM.

30:27.460 --> 30:28.525
THAT'S ME,

30:28.561 --> 30:30.160
JUST A FEW FEET
FROM STARDOM,

30:30.195 --> 30:31.194
BUT IT'S REALLY TERRIBLE

30:31.230 --> 30:32.363
WHAT THEY'RE DOING
TO PHOEBE.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.197
YEAH.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.366
[JONAH]: I HATED TO HAVE
TO TELL THE COPS WHAT I'D HEARD,

30:35.401 --> 30:37.234
BUT I COULDN'T LIE, COULD I?

30:37.269 --> 30:38.435
YOU COULD'VE LIED.

30:38.471 --> 30:39.436
UH, NO, HE COULDN'T.

30:39.472 --> 30:40.437
WELL...

30:40.473 --> 30:42.740
BUT SHE'S DIDN'T MEAN IT
WHEN SHE THREATENED HIM.

30:42.775 --> 30:43.841
THAT'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT PEOPLE SAY.

30:43.876 --> 30:44.908
RIGHT.

30:44.943 --> 30:45.843
[NORAH]: I MEAN, LOOK,

30:45.878 --> 30:47.745
IF IT HADN'T BEEN
FOR PHOEBE BEGGING HIM,

30:47.780 --> 30:49.880
I WOULDN'T EVEN BE
HER BACK-UP SINGER.

30:49.915 --> 30:51.281
I'D BE A WAITRESS
SOMEWHERE.

30:51.316 --> 30:52.148
YEAH.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.617
PHOEBE EVEN SAID
SHE'D TAKE ME WITH HER

30:53.652 --> 30:55.185
WHEN SHE WENT TO EVAN CARLTON.

30:55.220 --> 30:56.453
EVAN CARLTON...

30:56.489 --> 30:58.522
DID YOU SUSPECT
SOMETHING MORE...

30:59.992 --> 31:01.759
PERSONAL...

31:01.794 --> 31:02.860
IN PHOEBE'S RELATIONSHIP
WITH EVAN?

31:02.895 --> 31:04.261
I NEVER THOUGHT SO.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.296
[NORAH]:
SHE COULD DO WORSE,

31:06.331 --> 31:07.297
BUT NO,
I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING.

31:07.332 --> 31:08.732
WELL...

31:08.768 --> 31:09.767
YEAH.

31:09.802 --> 31:11.468
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
- YEAH.

31:11.504 --> 31:12.569
[NORAH]: YOU UNDERSTAND,
PHOEBE'S A FRIEND.

31:12.605 --> 31:14.838
I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HER.

31:16.842 --> 31:18.275
THANK YOU.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.209
THANK YOU.
THAT'S NICE TO HEAR.

31:19.244 --> 31:20.310
WHAT I MEAN IS,

31:20.345 --> 31:21.545
IF YOU WANTED ME TO TESTIFY

31:21.580 --> 31:22.413
THAT PHOEBE WAS WITH ME
THAT NIGHT,

31:22.448 --> 31:23.914
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

31:26.184 --> 31:27.050
WERE YOU WITH
HER THAT NIGHT?

31:28.353 --> 31:30.220
WELL, NO.

31:30.255 --> 31:33.490
OKAY, WELL, WE COULDN'T ASK YOU
TO LIE TO PROTECT PHOEBE.

31:33.526 --> 31:34.391
BECAUSE THAT
WOULD BE PERJURY.

31:34.427 --> 31:35.392
RIGHT.

31:36.529 --> 31:37.428
I SEE.

31:37.463 --> 31:38.729
WELL, THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO

31:38.764 --> 31:40.464
TO PROTECT HER.

31:40.499 --> 31:41.799
YEAH, WHAT
IS YOUR PLAN?

31:41.834 --> 31:44.401
OUR PLAN
IS TO FIND THE TRUTH.

31:44.437 --> 31:45.436
RIGHT.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.838
OKAY...

31:47.873 --> 31:50.240
BUT YOU KNOW
THAT SHE KILLED HIM, RIGHT?

31:50.275 --> 31:51.942
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THAT?

31:51.977 --> 31:53.944
[MILES]: WELL, THAT
HAS YET TO BE PROVEN.

31:57.015 --> 31:58.081
WELL, THANKS.

31:58.116 --> 31:59.817
IF WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS,

31:59.852 --> 32:00.751
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

32:14.299 --> 32:15.265
DO YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?

32:15.300 --> 32:16.667
MM...

32:16.702 --> 32:18.001
I THINK IF I HAVE
ANY MORE COFFEE,

32:18.036 --> 32:19.035
I'LL BE UP FOR A WEEK.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.604
NOT THAT I CAN
SLEEP ANYWAY.

32:20.639 --> 32:21.872
WELL, YOU HAVE
TO DRINK SOMETHING.

32:21.907 --> 32:23.640
YOU HAVE TO STAY HYDRATED.

32:23.676 --> 32:24.675
OKAY, FIRST OFF,

32:24.710 --> 32:25.642
COFFEE IS A DIURETIC.

32:25.678 --> 32:27.344
SECOND, REALLY, CLAIRE?
THAT'S MY PROBLEM?

32:27.379 --> 32:28.612
MY PROBLEM--

32:28.647 --> 32:31.281
MY SISTER'S ON TRIAL FOR MURDER,
AND I'VE GOT TO STAY HYDRATED?

32:31.316 --> 32:32.415
MY DAD USED TO SAY

32:32.451 --> 32:34.618
THAT YOU HAVE TO HANDLE
WHAT YOU CAN, WHEN YOU CAN,

32:34.653 --> 32:36.787
AND RIGHT NOW,
YOU CAN HANDLE STAYING HYDRATED.

32:36.822 --> 32:37.788
MY DAD ALWAYS
USED TO SAY,

32:37.823 --> 32:38.822
"PICK THAT UP!"

32:38.858 --> 32:39.790
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING.

32:39.825 --> 32:40.958
THAT'S GOOD,
'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

32:40.993 --> 32:41.859
BUT GRAPE SODA.

32:43.829 --> 32:45.462
GIVE ME A GRAPE SODA, PLEASE.

32:45.498 --> 32:46.563
WHAT?

32:46.599 --> 32:48.198
OH, YEAH, I'LL
HAVE A GRAPE SODA.

32:48.233 --> 32:49.132
I LOVE GRAPE SODA.

32:49.167 --> 32:50.801
WE HAVE GRAPE SODA?

32:50.836 --> 32:52.335
NO, I USED TO DRINK TONS
OF GRAPE SODA AS A YOUTH.

32:52.371 --> 32:53.336
THEY USED TO CALL ME
"THE GRAPE SODA KID".

32:53.372 --> 32:54.337
PLEASE.

32:54.373 --> 32:56.373
IT'S A WONDER YOU SURVIVED.

32:56.408 --> 32:57.307
YOU DON'T LIKE GRAPE SODA?

32:57.342 --> 32:58.308
I...

32:58.343 --> 33:00.076
NEVER TRIED IT.

33:00.112 --> 33:02.045
NEVER... YOU'VE NEVER TRIED...

33:02.080 --> 33:03.514
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

33:03.549 --> 33:04.882
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY
A GRAPE SODA RIGHT NOW.

33:04.917 --> 33:06.016
NO.

33:06.051 --> 33:06.984
RIGHT NOW, TRY A GRAPE SODA.

33:07.019 --> 33:08.018
NO.

33:08.053 --> 33:09.520
TRY IT FOR ME.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.824
OKAY...

33:13.859 --> 33:14.992
FINE.

33:23.468 --> 33:24.835
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'S GUILTY, RIGHT?

33:24.870 --> 33:26.069
NOT FOR A MINUTE.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.607
OKAY.

33:30.643 --> 33:33.911
YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT
'CAUSE OF... ME?

33:33.946 --> 33:36.046
NO.

33:36.081 --> 33:38.682
NO, I'D FEEL BAD
FOR YOU,

33:38.717 --> 33:39.616
BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY
TELL YOU

33:39.652 --> 33:40.551
IF I THOUGHT
SHE WAS GUILTY.

33:40.586 --> 33:41.919
SHE'S NOT.

33:43.822 --> 33:45.121
THANKS.

33:45.157 --> 33:45.889
MM...

33:47.325 --> 33:48.625
THAT TASTES
NOTHING LIKE GRAPE.

33:48.661 --> 33:50.027
I KNOW.

33:50.062 --> 33:51.762
IT'S LIKE NO OTHER FLAVOR
KNOWN TO MAN.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.597
IT'S EXCELLENT.

33:53.632 --> 33:54.898
WHY DO THEY CALL IT GRAPE?

33:56.268 --> 33:57.300
YOU'VE GOT TO CALL IT SOMETHING.

33:57.335 --> 33:58.769
THAT'S THE LEGALESE.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.370
MM.

34:02.975 --> 34:04.074
I KIND OF LIKE IT.

34:04.109 --> 34:05.776
[CHUCKLING]

34:05.811 --> 34:07.044
I KNOW,
IT'S KIND OF AMAZING.

34:07.079 --> 34:08.545
IT GROWS ON YOU.

34:17.089 --> 34:18.722
SO...

34:18.757 --> 34:20.591
NOW WOULD BE A TERRIBLE
TIME FOR A KISS...

34:20.626 --> 34:21.925
RIGHT?

34:21.960 --> 34:22.926
TOTALLY.

34:22.962 --> 34:24.695
YEAH.

34:39.311 --> 34:40.777
- SHALL WE WAIT 'TIL...
- YEAH.

34:40.813 --> 34:41.978
- TILL OUR HEADS ARE CLEAR.
- TILL OUR HEADS ARE CLEAR.

34:42.014 --> 34:43.947
RIGHT. YES. OKAY.

34:43.983 --> 34:45.315
ALL RIGHT.

34:46.485 --> 34:49.085
WELL...

34:49.121 --> 34:50.020
GOOD NIGHT, COUNSELOR.

34:50.054 --> 34:51.154
GOOD NIGHT.

35:09.975 --> 35:11.842
I'VE GOT TO GET
MORE OF THIS STUFF.

35:22.669 --> 35:26.705
"IT IS A FAR, FAR BETTER THING
THAT I DO,

35:26.740 --> 35:29.040
THAN I HAVE EVER DONE;

35:29.075 --> 35:32.810
IT IS A FAR, FAR BETTER REST
THAT I GO TO,

35:32.846 --> 35:34.613
THAN I HAVE EVER KNOWN."

35:36.283 --> 35:38.283
THE END.

35:38.318 --> 35:39.784
SO HE WENT
TO THE GUILLOTINE?

35:39.819 --> 35:41.419
YEP.

35:41.455 --> 35:42.587
FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

35:42.623 --> 35:44.055
NICE BEDTIME STORY, MOM.

35:44.090 --> 35:45.257
IT'S A CLASSIC.

35:46.192 --> 35:47.959
I LIKED IT.

35:47.994 --> 35:49.461
TOMORROW,
WE START ON OLIVER TWIST.

35:52.499 --> 35:53.498
MOM?

35:53.533 --> 35:55.433
YEAH?

35:55.469 --> 35:57.068
I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT
TO PLAY BASEBALL ANYMORE.

35:57.103 --> 35:58.069
WHAT?

35:58.104 --> 35:59.170
WHY NOT?

35:59.205 --> 36:01.239
ARE THE BOYS
BEING MEAN TO YOU?

36:01.275 --> 36:02.641
NO, NO, THEY'RE NICE.

36:02.676 --> 36:04.576
WHAT, IS THE COACH
GIVING YOU TROUBLE?

36:04.611 --> 36:06.645
I DON'T THINK SO.

36:07.947 --> 36:08.813
THEN WHAT IS IT?

36:12.185 --> 36:14.819
THEY DON'T MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE I'M PART OF THE TEAM.

36:14.854 --> 36:15.754
YOU KNOW, THEY...

36:15.789 --> 36:17.522
THEY TREAT ME LIKE
I'M SOMETHING SPECIAL.

36:17.557 --> 36:19.457
WELL, YOU ARE
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

36:19.493 --> 36:21.058
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

36:22.462 --> 36:23.628
THEY TREAT ME
LIKE I'M A GIRL.

36:23.664 --> 36:26.331
OH, HONEY...

36:26.366 --> 36:28.166
YOU ARE A GIRL.

36:28.201 --> 36:31.803
I KNOW,
BUT I JUST...

36:31.838 --> 36:33.171
I THINK IT'D BE
BETTER IF I QUIT...

36:33.206 --> 36:34.339
YOU KNOW, FOCUS
ON DEBATE TEAM.

36:36.376 --> 36:37.309
DO YOU LIKE BASEBALL?

36:37.344 --> 36:38.343
I LOVE IT.

36:39.646 --> 36:41.145
THEN YOU SHOULD DO
WHAT YOU LOVE.

36:44.050 --> 36:45.850
I GUESS SO.

36:45.885 --> 36:47.151
I'LL GIVE IT
ANOTHER SHOT.

36:48.588 --> 36:50.488
JUST SEE HOW IT GOES.

36:58.264 --> 36:59.831
YOU WERE LISTENING?

36:59.866 --> 37:00.965
WELL, IT SAVES TIME.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.667
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

37:02.703 --> 37:04.869
I THINK SHE JUST WANTS
TO BE A PART OF THE TEAM.

37:04.904 --> 37:06.738
WELL, I KNOW
HOW SHE FEELS.

37:06.773 --> 37:08.506
OH, SO THIS IS
ABOUT YOU, NOW?

37:08.542 --> 37:10.241
IT'S ABOUT ME,
HER, YOU.

37:10.276 --> 37:12.544
IT'S ABOUT ALL OF US.

37:12.579 --> 37:13.511
I'M GOING TO
GIVE THAT COACH

37:13.547 --> 37:15.847
A PIECE OF MY MIND.

37:15.882 --> 37:17.716
ALL RIGHT, CAN I--
CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING?

37:17.751 --> 37:18.683
CAN I STOP YOU?

37:20.220 --> 37:22.019
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE,
AND I USED TO TELL YOU

37:22.055 --> 37:24.556
THAT YOU CAN CATCH MORE FLIES
WITH HONEY THAN WITH VINEGAR?

37:24.591 --> 37:25.990
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT.

37:26.025 --> 37:27.992
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO ATTRACT FLIES?

37:28.027 --> 37:29.093
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

37:29.128 --> 37:31.195
JUST... LET ME TALK TO HIM.

37:32.566 --> 37:33.732
YOU KNOW THAT I WAS VOTED

37:33.767 --> 37:34.699
"MOST LIKELY
TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS"

37:34.735 --> 37:35.567
IN MY SENIOR CLASS.

37:35.602 --> 37:37.535
YEAH, HOW DID YOU WIN THAT,
ANYWAY?

37:39.072 --> 37:40.238
I WANTED IT.

37:42.041 --> 37:43.908
EASY.

37:54.654 --> 37:56.254
YEAH, I TOOK
A LOT OF PICTURES

37:56.289 --> 37:57.722
OF THAT LAST SESSION.

37:57.758 --> 37:59.691
YOU KNOW, FOR PUBLICITY
AND FOR THE ALBUM COVER.

37:59.726 --> 38:00.759
HERE THEY ARE.

38:00.794 --> 38:01.726
DID ANYTHING
STRIKE YOU AS ODD

38:01.762 --> 38:02.761
ABOUT THAT LAST SESSION?

38:02.796 --> 38:05.062
YOU MEAN ASIDE FROM TERRY
BEING A ROYAL SLEAZEBAG?

38:05.098 --> 38:06.130
HE HAD HER SO UPSET

38:06.165 --> 38:07.766
THAT SHE FIDGETED
WITH HER MIC STAND

38:07.801 --> 38:08.600
ALL THROUGH THE SESSION.

38:08.635 --> 38:11.302
YOU CAN EVEN SEE THAT
IN THIS PICTURE.

38:11.337 --> 38:13.772
I SWEAR, IT'S AS IF
HE LIKED TO SEE HER CRY.

38:13.807 --> 38:15.106
WHAT DID HE SAY
TO MAKE HER CRY?

38:15.141 --> 38:16.574
SPECIFICALLY?

38:16.610 --> 38:18.309
HE SAID SHE HAD NO TALENT

38:18.344 --> 38:19.977
AND THAT SHE WAS NOTHING
WITHOUT HIM.

38:20.013 --> 38:21.112
OKAY, BUT...

38:21.147 --> 38:23.748
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYONE
WHO WOULD WANT TO KILL HIM?

38:24.918 --> 38:26.017
ONLY EVERYBODY
WHO EVER MET HIM.

38:27.086 --> 38:28.085
RIGHT.

38:28.121 --> 38:29.721
THAT NARROWS IT DOWN.

38:29.756 --> 38:30.688
THANKS.

38:33.359 --> 38:34.125
SO, WAS THERE
ANYTHING UNUSUAL

38:34.160 --> 38:35.593
ABOUT THE LAST
RECORDING SESSION?

38:35.629 --> 38:37.094
I'VE TOLD YOU, NO.

38:37.130 --> 38:39.263
TERRY WAS ABUSIVE,
BUT THAT WAS NORMAL.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.166
DID YOU ALWAYS HAVE
THAT MUCH TROUBLE

38:42.201 --> 38:44.235
WITH YOUR MIC STAND?

38:44.270 --> 38:45.637
I DON'T KNOW.

38:45.672 --> 38:47.271
TERRY HAD ME SO RATTLED.

38:47.307 --> 38:49.106
I WAS-- I WAS HAVING TROUBLE
WITH EVERYTHING.

38:49.142 --> 38:50.608
THINK.

38:50.644 --> 38:51.609
PLEASE.

38:51.645 --> 38:52.844
UM...

38:52.879 --> 38:55.647
I GUESS IT WAS A LITTLE...

38:55.682 --> 38:57.148
I DON'T KNOW, SLIPPERY.

39:00.053 --> 39:02.487
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU SWITCH IT OUT
FOR ANOTHER ONE?

39:02.522 --> 39:04.789
I KNOW IT'S SILLY, BUT...

39:04.825 --> 39:08.125
THAT PARTICULAR STAND
WAS KIND OF A GOOD LUCK CHARM.

39:08.161 --> 39:09.828
I ALWAYS USED IT,

39:09.863 --> 39:11.095
AND EVERYONE WOULD KID ME
ABOUT IT,

39:11.130 --> 39:15.500
BUT WHEN I STOOD
IN FRONT OF THAT STAND...

39:15.535 --> 39:17.134
I COULD REALLY SING.

39:20.239 --> 39:21.238
HMM.

39:28.882 --> 39:30.381
IT LOOKS LIKE
AN ORDINARY MIC STAND.

39:30.416 --> 39:32.116
I KNOW, BUT LOOK
AT THE COLOR PICTURE.

39:32.151 --> 39:33.651
YOU SEE THE THING ON TOP

39:33.687 --> 39:34.652
THAT YOU USE
TO TIGHTEN IT?

39:34.688 --> 39:35.653
IT'S RED.

39:37.524 --> 39:38.556
THE CLIP?

39:38.592 --> 39:39.357
YEAH, YOU KNEW THAT?

39:39.392 --> 39:40.825
YEAH, I KNEW THAT.
WHAT, YOU DIDN'T?

39:40.861 --> 39:41.960
NAH, I HAD
TO LOOK IT UP.

39:41.995 --> 39:42.994
I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

39:43.029 --> 39:44.295
WHY ARE WE LOOKING
FOR THIS?

39:44.330 --> 39:45.363
I DON'T KNOW.

39:45.398 --> 39:46.898
IT IS JUST A HUNCH.

39:46.933 --> 39:49.033
YEAH, WELL...
ALL RIGHT.

39:49.068 --> 39:51.503
HUNCH IS GOOD.
HUNCH IS ALL WE HAVE.

39:51.538 --> 39:52.637
AH!

39:52.672 --> 39:53.838
WHAT?

39:53.874 --> 39:55.072
I JUST...

39:55.108 --> 39:56.173
I SWORE I WOULDN'T
LET HER DOWN AGAIN,

39:56.209 --> 39:57.709
AND NOW,
HERE WE ARE.

39:57.744 --> 39:59.377
YOU SAID THAT EARLIER...

39:59.412 --> 40:00.111
AND PHOEBE SWORE

40:00.146 --> 40:01.946
THAT YOU NEVER DID
LET HER DOWN.

40:03.082 --> 40:04.348
WELL, SHE...

40:04.384 --> 40:05.216
SHE'S BEING KIND.

40:05.251 --> 40:06.918
SHE WAS...

40:06.953 --> 40:09.220
WHEN MY DAD AND HIS WIFE DIED,

40:09.255 --> 40:11.523
SHE WAS JUST A TEENAGER,
YOU KNOW,

40:11.558 --> 40:13.591
AND...

40:13.627 --> 40:14.592
THAT'S A ROUGH TIME
TO BE AN ORPHAN,

40:14.628 --> 40:19.196
AND I WAS STARTING OUT
AS A LAWYER, YOU KNOW,

40:19.232 --> 40:20.532
HUNGRY, GOT TO SUCCEED,

40:20.567 --> 40:23.434
SO I WASN'T REALLY THERE
FOR HER, YOU KNOW,

40:23.469 --> 40:24.335
AT LEAST NOT THE WAY
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN,

40:24.370 --> 40:26.504
AND SHE GOT IN TROUBLE,
LOST HER WAY.

40:26.540 --> 40:28.272
MM, I'M SORRY.

40:28.307 --> 40:29.273
YEAH.

40:29.308 --> 40:31.108
THEN... YOU KNOW...

40:31.144 --> 40:32.410
SHE DISCOVERED MUSIC...

40:32.445 --> 40:34.278
YOU KNOW,
DISCOVERED THIS,

40:34.313 --> 40:35.847
AND IT...

40:35.882 --> 40:36.915
IT SAVED HER.

40:36.950 --> 40:39.017
YOU KNOW,
SHE CLEANED HERSELF UP,

40:39.052 --> 40:39.951
STARTED OVER.

40:39.986 --> 40:42.219
I WAS STARTING TO MAKE MONEY
AS A LAWYER,

40:42.255 --> 40:43.688
SO I COULD PUT HER THROUGH
A FINE ARTS COLLEGE.

40:43.723 --> 40:45.356
THAT WAS NICE,
YOU GAVE HER...

40:45.391 --> 40:46.223
I MEAN,
YOU HELPED HER THERE, RIGHT?

40:46.259 --> 40:48.392
RIGHT, BUT THAT WAS
AFTER THE FACT.

40:48.428 --> 40:49.861
YOU KNOW, TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.

40:49.896 --> 40:50.695
SHE SAVED HERSELF,

40:50.730 --> 40:52.564
WHICH IS WHY I NEED
TO SAVE HER NOW.

40:52.599 --> 40:53.665
I OWE HER.

40:56.570 --> 40:57.869
I REMEMBER WHEN MY FATHER DIED.

40:57.904 --> 40:59.771
I SWORE I WOULDN'T LET HIS FIRM
GO UNDER.

40:59.806 --> 41:02.073
AND... YOU DIDN'T.

41:02.108 --> 41:03.942
YEAH...

41:03.977 --> 41:06.945
AND YOU...
YOU WON'T LET PHOEBE DOWN.

41:07.948 --> 41:08.680
THANK YOU.

41:10.149 --> 41:12.450
SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE, UM...

41:13.620 --> 41:14.586
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

41:14.621 --> 41:16.153
WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

41:16.189 --> 41:17.288
A MIC STAND.

41:17.323 --> 41:20.257
OH, UH,
WE HAVE LOTS OF THOSE.

41:20.293 --> 41:22.226
NO, NOT...
NO ORDINARY MIC STAND.

41:22.261 --> 41:23.494
THIS ONE.

41:23.529 --> 41:24.629
UH...

41:25.865 --> 41:27.599
WOW, YEAH.

41:27.634 --> 41:28.666
YOU RECOGNIZE IT?

41:28.702 --> 41:29.934
UH, YEP,

41:29.970 --> 41:31.435
THAT'S PHOEBE'S
FAVORITE MIC STAND.

41:31.471 --> 41:32.470
ISN'T IT HERE?

41:32.505 --> 41:33.471
NOPE, CAN'T FIND IT.

41:33.506 --> 41:34.472
WELL, THAT'S WEIRD.

41:34.507 --> 41:36.574
IT'S USUALLY RIGHT HERE.

41:36.610 --> 41:38.109
WELL, IT'S NOT HERE NOW.

41:38.144 --> 41:39.343
[MUTTERING]

41:39.378 --> 41:40.478
[STAMMERING]

41:40.513 --> 41:42.013
- UH, CAREFUL, PLEASE.
- OH, SORRY.

41:42.048 --> 41:43.147
THANK YOU.

41:43.182 --> 41:45.149
ACTUALLY, IF YOU...

41:45.184 --> 41:46.684
GO OUT THAT WAY?
YEAH, OKAY, GREAT.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.785
TERRIFIC.

41:47.821 --> 41:48.953
WE WON'T SIT
ON THAT ANYMORE.

41:48.989 --> 41:50.788
OKAY.
THANKS.

41:50.824 --> 41:51.756
THANK YOU.

41:54.828 --> 41:55.927
UH-OH,
YOU'RE MAKING A FACE.

41:55.962 --> 41:57.261
WHAT'S THAT FACE?

41:57.296 --> 41:58.262
YOU HAVE AN IDEA?

41:58.297 --> 41:59.764
MAYBE.

41:59.799 --> 42:00.798
'CAUSE WHEN YOU MAKE
THAT FACE WHEN I'M A D.A.,

42:00.834 --> 42:01.866
I KNOW I'M IN TROUBLE

42:01.901 --> 42:02.600
'CAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO WIN THE CASE.

42:02.636 --> 42:03.534
ARE YOU ABOUT
TO WIN THIS CASE?

42:03.569 --> 42:06.170
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD
OF OURSELVES, BUT...

42:06.205 --> 42:07.672
LET'S SAY IT'S A STEP
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

42:08.842 --> 42:09.807
I LIKE THAT.

42:09.843 --> 42:11.275
YEAH, ME TOO.

42:19.501 --> 42:20.534
GOOD JOB!

42:20.569 --> 42:21.869
VINCENT.
YOU'RE OKAY, FELLAS.

42:21.904 --> 42:22.870
EASY OUT, EASY OUT.

42:22.905 --> 42:24.304
HE'S STILL NOT
PLAYING HER.

42:24.340 --> 42:25.539
ALL RIGHT.

42:25.574 --> 42:26.406
I'LL GO TALK TO HIM.

42:26.442 --> 42:28.475
HE SAID SHE WAS ONE
OF HIS BEST PLAYERS.

42:28.510 --> 42:30.978
NO, HE SAID THAT
SHE WASN'T BAD.

42:31.013 --> 42:33.013
HIS TONE SAID
SHE WAS ONE OF HIS BEST.

42:33.049 --> 42:35.082
YEAH, YEAH, HIS TONE
WAS PRETTY POSITIVE.

42:35.118 --> 42:36.416
I'M GOING
TO GO TALK TO HIM.

42:36.452 --> 42:38.819
WHAT DID WE DECIDE
ABOUT HONEY AND VINEGAR?

42:38.855 --> 42:40.320
YEAH, I'M GOING
TO GIVE HIM SOME VINEGAR.

42:40.356 --> 42:41.555
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LOOKED UP THAT SAYING,

42:41.590 --> 42:42.656
AND YOU KNOW
WHO SAID IT?

42:42.691 --> 42:45.092
- WHO?
- BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.

42:45.128 --> 42:46.193
NOW, DO YOU REALLY WANT

42:46.229 --> 42:47.661
TO MOCK
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN?

42:47.696 --> 42:48.929
MAYBE.

42:48.965 --> 42:50.497
SERIOUSLY?

42:50.532 --> 42:52.199
NO, YOU DON'T.

42:52.235 --> 42:53.167
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

42:58.207 --> 43:00.107
OKAY, FELLAS,
EASY OUT, EASY OUT.

43:00.143 --> 43:01.375
- GOOD GAME.
- KIMINSKY, WARM UP.

43:05.782 --> 43:06.680
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T
HELP BUT NOTICE

43:06.715 --> 43:09.349
THAT YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED
THE WHOLE TEAM.

43:09.385 --> 43:10.417
MOST OF THEM.

43:10.452 --> 43:11.518
MOST OF THEM, YES.

43:11.553 --> 43:12.519
MOST OF THEM.

43:12.554 --> 43:13.520
BUT NOT ALL OF THEM.

43:13.555 --> 43:14.388
NO, NOT ALL OF THEM.

43:14.423 --> 43:15.389
NOT LOU.

43:15.424 --> 43:19.426
NO, NOT LOU...
PLAY THE BALL, PLAY THE BALL!

43:19.461 --> 43:20.795
AH, WHY HAVEN'T YOU PLAYED LOU?

43:20.830 --> 43:21.762
I'LL GET AROUND TO HER.

43:21.798 --> 43:22.797
OH, YOU WILL?

43:22.832 --> 43:23.764
YEP, DON'T YOU WORRY.

43:23.800 --> 43:24.965
IN WHAT INNING?

43:25.001 --> 43:26.066
YOU MEAN, WHAT GAME?

43:26.102 --> 43:28.903
WHAT, SO... YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO USE HER IN THIS GAME?

43:28.938 --> 43:31.205
DON'T THINK SO...
COME ON, BLUE, THAT WAS INSIDE!

43:31.240 --> 43:32.639
DO YOU THINK
THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE

43:32.675 --> 43:34.775
FOR US TO HAVE A DISCUSSION
ABOUT THIS?

43:36.245 --> 43:37.144
A DISCUSSION?

43:37.180 --> 43:38.512
LIKE COFFEE?

43:42.919 --> 43:45.085
OKAY.

43:45.121 --> 43:47.487
OKAY...
THIS WEEK?

43:47.523 --> 43:48.655
SURE.

43:48.691 --> 43:50.191
IT'S TWO-WAY, BOYS,
TWO-WAY.

43:56.199 --> 43:57.231
WELL?

43:57.266 --> 43:58.065
WELL, IT'S WORKING.

43:58.100 --> 43:59.766
I MEAN, IT MIGHT TAKE
A LITTLE LONGER

43:59.802 --> 44:00.835
THAN WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT,

44:00.870 --> 44:02.736
BUT HE'LL COME AROUND.

44:02.771 --> 44:04.471
I GIVE HONEY ONE WEEK,

44:04.506 --> 44:05.639
NO MATTER
WHAT BEN FRANKLIN SAYS.

44:05.674 --> 44:07.074
JUST TRUST ME.

44:20.656 --> 44:22.356
MS. DARROW WANTED ME

44:22.391 --> 44:25.359
TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT WE ARE.

44:25.394 --> 44:28.595
SO, MY FIRST QUESTION IS...

44:28.630 --> 44:29.864
WHAT ARE WE?

44:29.899 --> 44:31.265
A LAW FIRM.

44:32.468 --> 44:33.400
WRONG.

44:35.838 --> 44:36.871
WE'RE A TRIBE.

44:36.906 --> 44:38.472
A TRIBE IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE

44:38.507 --> 44:41.041
CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER,
CONNECTED TO AN IDEA,

44:41.077 --> 44:44.011
BUT I DON'T THINK
WE REALLY KNOW EACH OTHER.

44:44.046 --> 44:45.145
SO THE FIRST THING
WE'RE GOING TO DO

44:45.181 --> 44:47.147
IS GO AROUND AND TELL EACH OTHER

44:47.183 --> 44:49.283
THREE LITTLE-KNOWN
THINGS ABOUT OURSELVES.

44:49.318 --> 44:51.085
YOU FIRST, ZOEY.

44:52.821 --> 44:53.954
WELL...

44:53.990 --> 44:57.024
I WAS BORN IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

44:58.560 --> 44:59.459
I USED TO BE A MARINE.

45:00.529 --> 45:02.196
I SERVED A TOUR

45:02.231 --> 45:03.864
IN AFGHANISTAN.

45:04.901 --> 45:05.866
WOW.

45:05.902 --> 45:07.467
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

45:07.503 --> 45:08.635
YOU NEVER ASKED.

45:09.671 --> 45:11.538
SEE?

45:11.573 --> 45:12.806
YOUR TURN, WINNIE.

45:12.841 --> 45:14.708
UM...

45:14.743 --> 45:16.643
MY FIRST NAME IS GODWIN.

45:16.678 --> 45:18.178
I KNOW, WEIRD.

45:18.214 --> 45:19.880
MY MOTHER
WAS A HIPPIE,

45:19.916 --> 45:22.049
AND I'M AN EXCELLENT BOWLER.

45:22.084 --> 45:23.750
[CHESTER]:
GOOD.

45:23.786 --> 45:24.718
JO...

45:28.057 --> 45:28.989
MS. DARROW.

45:31.394 --> 45:33.493
I SHOT A MAN IN RENO
JUST TO WATCH HIM DIE.

45:36.232 --> 45:36.830
REALLY?

45:39.768 --> 45:41.501
THAT IS A JOHNNY CASH LYRIC.

45:41.537 --> 45:44.238
I CAN'T... DON'T YOU GUYS
EVEN KNOW YOUR CLASSICS?

45:44.273 --> 45:45.672
[CHUCKLING]

45:45.707 --> 45:47.441
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

45:47.476 --> 45:48.442
WHO'S NEXT?

45:48.477 --> 45:49.876
YOU ARE.

45:49.912 --> 45:50.945
NO, I'M THE MODERATOR.

45:50.980 --> 45:52.112
COME ON.

45:52.148 --> 45:53.847
- CHESTER.
- FAIR IS FAIR.

45:53.882 --> 45:55.015
COME ON, CHESTER.

45:55.051 --> 45:56.283
OKAY.

45:56.319 --> 45:58.285
UH...

45:58.321 --> 46:01.855
I HAVE A SLIGHT CASE OF OCD.

46:01.890 --> 46:04.724
IT TOOK ME FOUR YEARS
TO GET THROUGH LAW SCHOOL...

46:06.662 --> 46:08.762
BUT I GRADUATED
TOP OF MY CLASS.

46:12.634 --> 46:15.035
MY FATHER'S STILL
ASHAMED OF ME.

46:19.775 --> 46:20.707
HEY, YOU GUYS READY TO GO
TO THE PRE-TRIAL HEARING?

46:20.742 --> 46:21.775
EVERYBODY READY?

46:21.810 --> 46:23.043
[JOANNA]: GIVE THEM
A MINUTE.

46:23.079 --> 46:25.212
THEY'RE BONDING.

46:26.782 --> 46:27.681
IT'S OKAY.

46:32.754 --> 46:33.988
I FOUND OUT SOMETHING
INTERESTING

46:34.023 --> 46:35.456
ABOUT THE WOMAN
WHO OWNED THE GUN.

46:35.491 --> 46:36.656
OH, MRS. HUDDLESTON, YEAH.

46:36.692 --> 46:38.725
YEAH, SHE USED TO BE A NANNY.

46:38.760 --> 46:40.627
AMONG THE CHILDREN
THAT SHE CARED FOR...

46:40.662 --> 46:41.928
LINDA RUTHERFORD.

46:41.964 --> 46:43.297
USED TO BE LINDA CARLTON.

46:43.332 --> 46:44.731
NOW SHE'S LINDA YASBECK.

46:44.766 --> 46:45.899
TERRY'S WIDOW.

46:45.934 --> 46:47.334
EXACTLY.

46:47.370 --> 46:48.835
SHE GOES TO VISIT HER
EVERY OTHER MONTH.

46:48.871 --> 46:50.404
SO SHE COULD HAVE STOLEN
THE GUN?

46:50.439 --> 46:51.638
MANY TIMES OVER.

46:51.673 --> 46:53.773
YOU DID A GOOD JOB, SCOTT.

46:53.809 --> 46:54.741
DIDN'T I?

47:01.484 --> 47:03.484
OKAY, NOW, THIS IS JUST
THE PRE-TRIAL HEARING.

47:03.519 --> 47:04.451
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING.

47:04.487 --> 47:05.585
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
ASK YOU ANY QUESTIONS.

47:05.621 --> 47:07.654
JUST... BE HERE.

47:07.689 --> 47:10.290
RIGHT, AND
LOOK INNOCENT.

47:10.326 --> 47:11.925
WHICH YOU ARE, RIGHT?

47:11.960 --> 47:13.460
YES!

47:14.563 --> 47:15.996
OKAY.

47:21.470 --> 47:22.469
SHE'S GOOD.

47:22.505 --> 47:23.870
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HER.

47:23.906 --> 47:24.804
I NEVER UNDERESTIMATE PEOPLE.

47:24.840 --> 47:26.806
GOOD.

47:26.842 --> 47:27.574
WHY, IS SHE BETTER THAN I AM?

47:30.046 --> 47:30.844
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
NO, OF COURSE NOT!

47:31.980 --> 47:33.647
WHY DO YOU THINK I HIRED YOU,
JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE CUTE?

47:33.682 --> 47:34.681
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

47:34.716 --> 47:35.715
WAIT, YOU
THINK I'M CUTE?

47:35.751 --> 47:36.783
YEAH.

47:36.818 --> 47:37.851
REALLY?

47:37.886 --> 47:38.785
EVERYBODY THINKS
YOU'RE CUTE.

47:38.820 --> 47:39.853
SO, LIKE...

47:39.888 --> 47:41.321
- HEARING'S THIS WAY.
- OKAY.

47:43.559 --> 47:44.491
I OBJECT.

47:44.527 --> 47:46.293
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN
A GUNSHOT-RESIDUE TEST

47:46.328 --> 47:47.894
ADMITTED AS EVIDENCE.

47:47.930 --> 47:49.629
THAT IS TRUE, MS. DARROW.

47:49.665 --> 47:50.897
I DON'T MEAN TO DISPARAGE
THE STATE'S TEST.

47:50.933 --> 47:52.999
I ONLY WANT TO VERIFY IT
AND EXPAND ON IT.

47:53.035 --> 47:54.068
YOUR HONOR,

47:54.103 --> 47:54.634
I DON'T SEE THE NEED
FOR US TO HAVE TO GO OVER--

47:54.670 --> 47:56.336
I DON'T SEE ANY HARM.

47:57.406 --> 47:58.338
I'M GOING TO ALLOW IT.

47:59.775 --> 48:01.341
JUDGE BATCHELLER ALWAYS
SAYS THAT AT FIRST.

48:01.377 --> 48:02.543
I KNOW, CHESTER.
PAY ATTENTION.

48:02.578 --> 48:04.411
SO, DR. ARMSTRONG,

48:04.447 --> 48:06.313
IS THIS THE RESULT
OF THE NEW TEST

48:06.348 --> 48:08.915
YOU ADMINISTERED
ON PHOEBE STRASBERG'S HANDS?

48:08.951 --> 48:09.849
[DR. ARMSTRONG]: YES.

48:09.885 --> 48:12.852
THE TESTS WERE
SOME DAYS AFTER THE EVENT,

48:12.888 --> 48:14.988
SO IT WAS DIFFICULT
TO OBTAIN ANY DEFINITE RESULTS.

48:15.023 --> 48:15.889
BUT YOU DID?

48:15.924 --> 48:17.724
I DID.
I'M AN EXPERT.

48:17.759 --> 48:20.494
YES, I KNOW,
WE ESTABLISHED THAT,

48:20.529 --> 48:22.529
AND WHAT WERE THE RESULTS
YOU FOUND?

48:22.565 --> 48:24.231
THE RESULTS CAME BACK POSITIVE.

48:24.266 --> 48:25.832
[D.A.]:
I OBJECT AGAIN.

48:25.867 --> 48:28.735
THIS MERELY CONFIRMS
THE STATE'S EVIDENCE,

48:28.770 --> 48:29.703
AND IT'S A WASTE
OF THE COURT'S TIME.

48:29.738 --> 48:31.838
I BEG THE COURT'S INDULGENCE,
YOUR HONOR.

48:31.873 --> 48:33.707
FOR A FEW MORE MINUTES,
MS. DARROW.

48:33.742 --> 48:35.875
THANK YOU.

48:35.911 --> 48:38.845
SO, IT CAME BACK POSITIVE
FOR GUNSHOT RESIDUE?

48:38.880 --> 48:39.913
[DR. ARMSTRONG]:
YES.

48:39.948 --> 48:40.847
[CLAIRE]:
WHAT ELSE?

48:40.882 --> 48:42.015
OBJECTION!

48:42.050 --> 48:43.383
OVERRULED.

48:43.419 --> 48:45.185
BRAKE FLUID.

48:45.221 --> 48:47.221
BRAKE FLUID?

48:47.256 --> 48:48.322
LIKE, FROM A CAR?

48:49.825 --> 48:51.625
[DR. ARMSTRONG]: INDEED.
IT COULD BE EITHER ONE.

48:51.660 --> 48:55.596
BRAKE FLUID CAN PRODUCE
A FALSE POSITIVE IN A GSR TEST.

48:56.898 --> 48:58.064
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

49:00.102 --> 49:02.068
SCORE ONE FOR MS. DARROW.

49:10.846 --> 49:11.878
[JUDGE]: ALTHOUGH
THE DEFENSE HAS PRESENTED

49:11.913 --> 49:12.946
SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS

49:12.981 --> 49:16.049
AS TO THE VALIDITY
OF THE GSR TEST,

49:16.084 --> 49:17.184
THE COURT FEELS

49:17.219 --> 49:20.154
THAT THE STATE'S CASE
IS STRONG ENOUGH TO GO TO TRIAL.

49:20.189 --> 49:21.421
BAIL HAS BEEN SET
FOR $500,000.

49:21.457 --> 49:22.456
[RAPPING GAVEL]

49:32.601 --> 49:34.901
I'LL FIND A WAY.

49:48.242 --> 49:50.308
SO, COACH REED...

49:50.344 --> 49:52.444
I FEEL FUNNY
CALLING YOU COACH.

49:52.479 --> 49:53.579
WHAT DO YOUR
FRIENDS CALL YOU?

49:53.614 --> 49:54.914
COACH.

49:54.949 --> 49:55.714
REALLY?

49:57.084 --> 49:58.417
YOU CAN CALL
ME JOANNA.

49:58.452 --> 49:59.351
JO?

50:00.454 --> 50:02.120
WHY NOT?

50:02.156 --> 50:03.622
LET'S TALK ABOUT LOU.

50:03.658 --> 50:05.090
WHAT ABOUT HER?

50:05.125 --> 50:05.925
DO YOU THINK
SHE'S A GOOD PLAYER?

50:05.960 --> 50:06.959
COULD BE.

50:06.994 --> 50:08.260
IF SHE PLAYED MORE?

50:08.295 --> 50:09.061
COULD BE.

50:09.096 --> 50:10.930
SO WHY DON'T YOU
LET HER PLAY MORE...

50:10.965 --> 50:12.297
OR AT ALL?

50:13.300 --> 50:14.633
I DON'T KNOW.

50:14.669 --> 50:16.234
WHY DON'T YOU THINK
I PLAY HER MORE?

50:16.270 --> 50:17.770
BECAUSE SHE'S A GIRL.

50:17.805 --> 50:19.237
- THAT'D BE DISCRIMINATION.
- YES, IT WOULD.

50:19.273 --> 50:20.172
SHE'S ON THE TEAM.

50:20.207 --> 50:21.006
TRUE.

50:21.042 --> 50:22.140
SO I'M NOT DISCRIMINATING
AGAINST HER.

50:22.176 --> 50:23.108
NEXT QUESTION?

50:23.143 --> 50:24.677
I...

50:24.712 --> 50:25.611
GIRLS HAVE EVERY BIT
AS MUCH RIGHT

50:25.646 --> 50:26.612
TO PLAY BASEBALL

50:26.647 --> 50:27.646
AS BOYS DO.

50:27.682 --> 50:28.914
OF COURSE THEY DO.

50:28.950 --> 50:29.748
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
JUST AS STRONG.

50:29.784 --> 50:30.683
THAT'S A MATTER OF OPINION,
I GUESS.

50:32.319 --> 50:34.352
SO ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT HER GETTING HURT?

50:34.388 --> 50:35.320
I DON'T WANT
ANY OF MY KIDS TO GET HURT,

50:35.355 --> 50:36.488
THE BOYS OR THE GIRLS.

50:36.523 --> 50:39.458
OH, SO YOU'RE
PROTECTING HER,

50:39.493 --> 50:41.159
AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
NOT LETTING HER PLAY?

50:42.463 --> 50:43.596
IT'S A BOY'S GAME, JO.

50:43.631 --> 50:45.931
IT'S NOT "JO",
IT'S JOANNA.

50:45.967 --> 50:47.933
NO, IT'S MS. DARROW,

50:47.969 --> 50:50.135
AND WHO SAYS
IT'S A BOY'S GAME?

50:50.170 --> 50:51.203
EVERYBODY.

50:51.238 --> 50:53.138
I MEAN, FOR A GIRL
TO REALLY BE ABLE TO COMPETE,

50:53.173 --> 50:54.439
SHE'D HAVE TO BE EXCEPTIONAL.

50:54.475 --> 50:55.440
OH!

50:55.476 --> 50:56.976
OH, SO SHE'D HAVE TO BE
BETTER THAN THE REST

50:57.011 --> 50:58.043
JUST TO GET TO PLAY?

50:58.079 --> 50:59.478
YEAH, I GUESS,

50:59.513 --> 51:01.714
BUT WHY GET
HER HOPES UP ANYWAY?

51:01.749 --> 51:02.848
LET HER PLAY SOFTBALL, JO.

51:02.883 --> 51:03.882
THAT'S A GIRL'S SPORT.

51:03.918 --> 51:06.852
BUT SHE LOVES
BASEBALL.

51:06.887 --> 51:07.820
I MEAN, WHY SHOULDN'T
SHE BE ABLE

51:07.855 --> 51:09.855
TO PLAY THE GAME
SHE LOVES?

51:09.890 --> 51:11.056
I MEAN, ESPECIALLY
IF SHE'S GOOD AT IT,

51:11.092 --> 51:12.357
AND SHE IS GOOD
AT IT...

51:12.392 --> 51:13.692
AND IF YOU'RE GOOD
AT ONE THING,

51:13.728 --> 51:14.593
JUST ONE THING,

51:14.629 --> 51:16.629
THAT CAN AFFECT THE
REST OF YOUR LIFE,

51:16.664 --> 51:18.330
AND... IT CAN MAKE
YOU BELIEVE

51:18.365 --> 51:21.066
THAT YOU CAN
DO ANYTHING.

51:21.102 --> 51:24.136
YOU REALLY WANT TO STAND
IN THE WAY OF THAT?

51:25.840 --> 51:27.673
OKAY.

51:27.708 --> 51:28.573
I'LL GIVE HER A SHOT.

51:28.609 --> 51:29.908
REALLY?

51:29.944 --> 51:31.376
SURE THING.

51:32.680 --> 51:33.746
IT'S GOOD COFFEE.

51:33.781 --> 51:35.047
THE NEXT ONE'S ON ME.

51:48.595 --> 51:49.494
THANK YOU FOR
BAILING ME OUT.

51:49.530 --> 51:50.529
OF COURSE.

51:50.564 --> 51:51.563
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW

51:51.598 --> 51:52.698
HOW I'M GOING
TO PAY YOU BACK.

51:52.733 --> 51:53.999
I'LL GET THE MONEY BACK

51:54.035 --> 51:56.234
WHEN YOU SHOW UP
FOR TRIAL... RIGHT?

51:56.270 --> 51:57.670
RIGHT. OF COURSE.

51:57.705 --> 51:59.337
WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE?

52:00.741 --> 52:03.942
I KNOW THINGS DON'T LOOK GREAT
RIGHT NOW,

52:03.978 --> 52:05.010
BUT CLAIRE IS THE BEST
ATTORNEY IN THE STATE.

52:05.046 --> 52:06.045
I KNOW, BUT...

52:06.080 --> 52:08.446
JUST GOT TO HAVE FAITH.

52:08.482 --> 52:09.614
OKAY?

52:09.650 --> 52:12.184
OKAY. OKAY.

52:12.219 --> 52:13.185
OKAY.

52:24.098 --> 52:25.864
I'M SORRY.

52:25.900 --> 52:27.066
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

52:27.101 --> 52:28.233
IT'S OUR SPACE.

52:32.807 --> 52:33.772
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

52:33.808 --> 52:35.574
IT ACTUALLY WORKED.

52:35.609 --> 52:36.608
HUH.

52:37.845 --> 52:38.811
CLAIRE?

52:38.846 --> 52:39.945
WHAT?

52:39.980 --> 52:41.046
YOU WERE ON ANOTHER PLANET.

52:41.082 --> 52:42.047
YOU WERE IN ORBIT THERE.
DID YOU BRING ANYTHING BACK?

52:42.083 --> 52:44.817
NO.

52:44.852 --> 52:46.284
NO.
DID YOU TALK TO MRS. YASBECK?

52:46.320 --> 52:47.152
YES, I DID.

52:47.188 --> 52:48.553
OKAY.

52:48.589 --> 52:49.722
SHE TOOK THE GUN
AWAY FROM MRS. HUDDLESTON

52:49.757 --> 52:50.956
BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID

52:50.991 --> 52:52.157
SHE WAS GOING
TO HURT HERSELF WITH IT

52:52.193 --> 52:53.225
BECAUSE SHE'S
IN EARLY-STAGE DEMENTIA.

52:53.260 --> 52:55.094
SO MRS. YASBECK SAYS.

52:55.129 --> 52:56.962
SHE GAVE THE GUN TO TERRY,
WHO KEPT IT IN HIS OFFICE.

52:58.432 --> 52:59.264
SO ANYONE COULD HAVE GOTTEN
THEIR HANDS ON IT.

52:59.299 --> 53:00.498
INCLUDING PHOEBE.

53:00.534 --> 53:03.001
UGH, SO WE'RE BACK
TO SQUARE ONE.

53:03.037 --> 53:04.737
DO YOU THINK
SHE'S BEING FRAMED?

53:04.772 --> 53:06.105
I THINK
THERE'S TWO POSSIBILITIES.

53:06.140 --> 53:08.107
ONE,
SHE'S BEING FRAMED...

53:08.142 --> 53:08.974
AND I DON'T THINK YOU WANT

53:09.009 --> 53:10.342
TO CONSIDER THE SECOND
POSSIBILITY...

53:10.377 --> 53:11.676
I CONSIDER ALL POSSIBILITIES.

53:11.712 --> 53:12.745
THAT SHE KILLED TERRY YASBECK?

53:12.780 --> 53:13.846
SHE DIDN'T KILL HIM.

53:13.881 --> 53:15.914
LOOK, USING OCCAM'S RAZOR...

53:15.950 --> 53:18.250
OH, OCCAM'S RAZOR AGAIN,
I HATE OCCAM'S RAZOR.

53:18.285 --> 53:20.018
OKAY, THERE ARE
TWO POSSIBILITIES.

53:20.054 --> 53:21.419
THE SIMPLEST ONE
IS THE MOST LIKELY.

53:21.455 --> 53:22.354
WHAT DOES OCCAM KNOW?

53:22.389 --> 53:23.321
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
THERE WAS AN OCCAM.

53:23.357 --> 53:24.322
WELL, THERE WAS.

53:24.358 --> 53:25.858
HE WAS A FRANCISCAN FRIAR.

53:25.893 --> 53:27.860
OKAY, WELL, NOW I FEEL BAD,

53:27.895 --> 53:29.461
BUT HE WASN'T A LAWYER.

53:29.496 --> 53:31.997
NO, NO,
HE WASN'T A LAWYER.

53:34.201 --> 53:35.134
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE DID IT, DO YOU?

53:38.472 --> 53:40.072
JUDGING BY THE FACTS,
I THINK SHE DID, YES.

53:41.909 --> 53:43.008
BUT WHAT DOES YOUR GUT SAY?

53:43.043 --> 53:43.909
MY GUT TELLS ME

53:43.944 --> 53:45.543
THAT YOU REALLY WANT HER
TO BE INNOCENT.

53:45.579 --> 53:46.779
- THAT WASN'T THE QUESTION.
- I KNOW.

53:46.814 --> 53:47.746
CHESTER?

53:49.316 --> 53:50.883
HAVE YOU LEARNED ANYTHING
FROM YASBECK'S COMPUTER SYSTEM?

53:50.918 --> 53:53.485
JUST THAT I DON'T CARE
FOR CONTEMPORARY MUSIC.

53:53.520 --> 53:54.653
KEEP LOOKING.

53:55.990 --> 53:57.455
UH, I THINK I MAY
HAVE SOMETHING HERE.

53:57.491 --> 53:58.623
WHAT?

53:58.659 --> 54:00.725
YOU WANTED ME
TO CALL DR. ARMSTRONG

54:00.761 --> 54:02.027
AND HAVE HIM ANALYZE
THE BRAKE FLUID.

54:02.062 --> 54:03.195
WELL, HE CAME BACK

54:03.230 --> 54:04.396
WITH SOMETHING
PRETTY INTERESTING.

54:04.431 --> 54:07.332
IT'S A BRAND OF FLUID THAT
ISN'T USED VERY MUCH ANYMORE,

54:07.367 --> 54:09.835
MOSTLY ON OLD MUSCLE CARS.

54:09.870 --> 54:11.203
UH-HUH...

54:11.238 --> 54:12.171
YOU'RE THINKING
JONAH'S MUSTANG?

54:12.206 --> 54:13.405
I AM.

54:13.440 --> 54:14.572
OKAY...

54:14.608 --> 54:16.341
SO YOU THINK
THAT MAYBE DELIBERATELY,

54:16.376 --> 54:17.976
SOMEONE PUT
BRAKE-FLUID OIL

54:18.012 --> 54:19.077
ON HER HANDS

54:19.113 --> 54:20.745
TO CAUSE A FALSE POSITIVE
ON THE GUNSHOT-RESIDUE TEST?

54:20.781 --> 54:21.746
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M THINKING.

54:21.782 --> 54:23.415
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S
TRACK THIS THROUGH, THEN.

54:23.450 --> 54:25.383
WHO WOULD KNOW
THAT THAT WOULD WORK?

54:25.419 --> 54:28.653
UH... SOMEBODY
WITH A BACKGROUND IN, UH...

54:28.689 --> 54:31.389
SCIENCE, CHEMISTRY,
LAW ENFORCEMENT?

54:31.425 --> 54:33.658
OR HE COULD HAVE GOOGLED IT.

54:33.694 --> 54:34.993
THAT'S WHAT I DID.

54:37.064 --> 54:38.430
I HATE THE INTERNET.

54:38.465 --> 54:40.132
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

54:46.040 --> 54:47.172
OH, WAIT, SO...

54:47.208 --> 54:48.240
YOU'RE SAYING

54:48.275 --> 54:49.674
YOU THINK
THE BRAKE FLUID CAME

54:49.710 --> 54:50.642
FROM JONAH'S CAR?

54:50.677 --> 54:52.544
I'M JUST SAYING, IT'S
WORTH CHECKING OUT.

54:52.579 --> 54:54.179

55:10.064 --> 55:11.930

55:11.966 --> 55:14.199
UH, I WAS JUST LOOKING
FOR JONAH.

55:14.235 --> 55:16.101
WE ARE TOO.

55:16.136 --> 55:18.337
WELL, THERE'S A SIDE DOOR.

55:30.117 --> 55:31.183
OH, MY GOSH.

55:33.287 --> 55:34.887

55:34.922 --> 55:35.988
JONAH!

55:36.023 --> 55:36.989
OH, MY GOSH.
CALL 911.

55:37.024 --> 55:38.090
HEY!

55:42.529 --> 55:43.762
HEY, HEY...

55:56.229 --> 55:57.729
HOW'S JONAH?

55:57.764 --> 55:59.297
IS HE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?

55:59.332 --> 56:00.264
NOBODY WILL TELL ME ANYTHING.

56:00.300 --> 56:02.067
HE HAS A CONCUSSION.

56:02.102 --> 56:03.267
HE'S GOING TO RECOVER,

56:03.303 --> 56:04.402
BUT IF
WE HADN'T COME IN,

56:04.437 --> 56:05.436
HE WOULD HAVE DIED

56:05.472 --> 56:06.972
FROM CARBON-MONOXIDE

56:07.007 --> 56:09.941
SO DO YOU THINK
SOMEBODY HIT HIM ON THE HEAD

56:09.977 --> 56:11.375
AND THEN STARTED THE CAR
TO KILL HIM?

56:12.412 --> 56:13.344
YES.

56:13.379 --> 56:16.114
CONSENSUS OF OPINION
SEEMS TO BE THAT WAS YOU.

56:17.985 --> 56:19.250
I SWEAR TO GOD,

56:19.285 --> 56:20.251
I JUST GOT THERE
WHEN YOU DID.

56:20.286 --> 56:22.621
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

56:22.656 --> 56:24.422
I GOT A PHONE CALL.

56:24.457 --> 56:25.957
FROM WHO?

56:25.993 --> 56:27.492
I DON'T KNOW.
THE NUMBER WAS BLOCKED.

56:27.527 --> 56:28.526
SO WHY'D YOU ANSWER IT?

56:28.561 --> 56:30.328
I JUST DID. YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES, YOU JUST DO.

56:30.363 --> 56:31.429
NO, I DON'T.
I DON'T EVER...

56:31.464 --> 56:32.864
WELL, I JUST DID.

56:33.934 --> 56:35.767
OKAY.

56:35.802 --> 56:38.136
ANYWAY,
WHO WAS IT?

56:38.171 --> 56:39.037
I STILL DIDN'T KNOW.

56:39.072 --> 56:41.205
THE VOICE WAS ALTERED
ELECTRONICALLY.

56:42.509 --> 56:43.508
WHAT DID IT SAY?

56:43.543 --> 56:44.843
THAT JONAH HAD MY ALBUM.

56:44.878 --> 56:46.410
AND YOU BELIEVED IT?

56:46.446 --> 56:47.478
NO, OF COURSE,
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.

56:47.514 --> 56:50.015
I STILL HAD TO GO CHECK IT OUT
AND SEE, DIDN'T I?

56:50.050 --> 56:52.751
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT THE ALBUM.

56:52.786 --> 56:54.686
IT'S STILL TWO YEARS' WORTH
OF WORK,

56:54.721 --> 56:56.521
OF SWEAT AND TEARS.

56:56.556 --> 56:57.756
I AT LEAST HAD TO GO
TALK TO JONAH,

56:57.791 --> 56:58.857
JUST SEE IF HE HAD IT,

56:58.892 --> 57:01.492
AND THAT'S WHEN I RAN
INTO YOU GUYS.

57:01.528 --> 57:03.628
SO THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN CORROBORATE THIS STORY

57:03.664 --> 57:06.164
IS AN UNIDENTIFIED VOICE
ON THE TELEPHONE?

57:08.035 --> 57:09.300
DOESN'T SOUND TOO GOOD,
DOES IT?

57:10.804 --> 57:11.803
NO, IT DOESN'T.

57:11.838 --> 57:13.938
[MILES]:
NOT SO GOOD, NO,

57:13.974 --> 57:15.439
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

57:17.044 --> 57:17.842
WE'LL GO TALK
TO JONAH...

57:17.878 --> 57:18.843
YEAH.

57:18.879 --> 57:22.113
SEE IF HE HAS ANYTHING
HE CAN SAY ABOUT THIS.

57:22.149 --> 57:24.415
WELL, TELL HIM
I SAY HELLO...

57:24.451 --> 57:26.284
AND THAT I DIDN'T TRY
TO KILL HIM.

57:26.319 --> 57:28.186
YEAH, LOOK,

57:28.221 --> 57:30.221
PHOEBES...

57:30.256 --> 57:31.723
THIS IS ALL GOING
TO BE OKAY.

57:35.696 --> 57:38.029
I KNOW YOU'RE LYING, BUT...

57:38.065 --> 57:40.298
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.

57:43.436 --> 57:44.969
HANG TIGHT.

57:57.017 --> 57:59.517
I WAS LUCKY.

57:59.552 --> 58:00.484
YOU CALL THIS LUCKY?

58:00.520 --> 58:03.421
CALL ME A "SKULL HALF-CRUSHED"
KIND OF GUY.

58:03.456 --> 58:05.056
ANOTHER FEW MINUTES,
AND I'D HAVE BEEN DEAD.

58:05.092 --> 58:06.891
I LIKE THAT
HALF-CRUSHED ANALOGY.

58:06.927 --> 58:08.760
HALF-CRUSHED IS GOOD,
FULL-CRUSHED IS BAD.

58:08.795 --> 58:09.894
DID YOU SEE WHO HIT YOU
ON THE HEAD?

58:09.930 --> 58:11.196
I DON'T REMEMBER.

58:11.231 --> 58:12.396
IT'S ALL KIND OF JUMBLED.

58:12.432 --> 58:13.998
DID YOU SEE PHOEBE
IN THE GARAGE?

58:15.769 --> 58:17.102
I DON'T REMEMBER.

58:17.137 --> 58:18.069
DO YOU HAVE
PHOEBE'S ALBUM?

58:18.105 --> 58:19.237
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

58:19.272 --> 58:20.471
WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT?

58:21.608 --> 58:22.907
I ASK YOU THAT
BECAUSE...

58:22.943 --> 58:23.942
PHOEBE GOT A--
WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT,

58:23.977 --> 58:24.909
AN ANONYMOUS CALL FROM AN--

58:24.945 --> 58:26.544
- A ROBOT...
- ELECTRONICALLY-ALTERED VOICE

58:26.579 --> 58:29.214
THAT SAID
YOU HAD HER ALBUM.

58:29.249 --> 58:30.949
WELL, I DON'T.

58:30.984 --> 58:32.383
WHO WOULD MAKE A CALL LIKE THAT?

58:32.418 --> 58:34.052
WE DON'T KNOW.

58:34.087 --> 58:35.186
DID ANYBODY ELSE HEAR THE CALL?

58:35.222 --> 58:37.055
- NO.
- NO.

58:37.090 --> 58:38.389
WELL, THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW...?

58:38.424 --> 58:41.025
WE DON'T. WE...

58:41.061 --> 58:43.261
WE DON'T KNOW
THAT PHOEBE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

58:43.296 --> 58:44.262
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

58:44.297 --> 58:45.396
WHO HAS THE ALBUM?

58:46.633 --> 58:48.066
WELL, I COULDN'T SAY.

58:48.101 --> 58:48.900
YOU COULDN'T SAY?

58:48.935 --> 58:51.402
WELL, UNLESS...

58:51.437 --> 58:53.337
EVAN CARLTON.

58:54.775 --> 58:55.740
HOW WOULD HE
GET IT?

58:55.776 --> 58:56.941
I DON'T KNOW.

58:56.977 --> 58:58.743
I JUST KNOW THAT HE WAS TRYING
TO GET IT AWAY FROM TERRY.

58:58.779 --> 58:59.778
HOW?

58:59.813 --> 59:00.745
I DON'T KNOW.

59:00.781 --> 59:04.883
MAYBE HE WENT TO SEE TERRY
THE NIGHT HE...

59:04.918 --> 59:06.717
THE NIGHT HE WAS KILLED?

59:06.753 --> 59:08.386
YEAH,
IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN.

59:11.258 --> 59:12.323
OKAY, WELL...

59:12.358 --> 59:13.658
OH, UM...

59:13.693 --> 59:16.161
PHOEBE SAYS TO SAY HI...

59:16.196 --> 59:17.561
AND SHE DIDN'T TRY
TO KILL YOU.

59:17.597 --> 59:18.462
OKAY.

59:18.498 --> 59:19.630
OKAY.

59:19.666 --> 59:20.564
TELL HER I BELIEVE HER.

59:20.600 --> 59:21.599
I WILL.

59:21.634 --> 59:23.234
FEEL BETTER.

59:23.270 --> 59:27.005
[HOSPITAL P.A.]: <i> DR. FORREST,
PLEASE DIAL 118.</i>

59:27.040 --> 59:28.273
NO, EVAN CARLTON WANTED

59:28.308 --> 59:30.074
TO STEAL PHOEBE AWAY
FROM TERRY,

59:30.110 --> 59:31.742
BECAUSE TERRY STOLE
EVAN'S WIFE AWAY FROM HIM.

59:31.778 --> 59:32.777
HE HATED TERRY.

59:32.813 --> 59:33.778
SO YOU THINK
EVAN CARLTON

59:33.814 --> 59:34.813
KILLED
TERRY YASBECK?

59:34.848 --> 59:35.847
TRY THIS ONE OUT
FOR SIZE.

59:35.882 --> 59:36.714
EVAN GOES TO TERRY
AND SAYS, "HEY,

59:36.749 --> 59:37.782
I'M GOING TO TAKE
PHOEBE AWAY FROM YOU,

59:37.818 --> 59:38.783
AND NOT ONLY THAT,

59:38.819 --> 59:39.984
I'M GOING TO TAKE PHOEBE'S
ALBUM AWAY FROM YOU."

59:40.020 --> 59:40.885
TERRY REFUSES, OF COURSE.

59:40.921 --> 59:42.620
THINGS ESCALATE,
OLD TENSIONS BOIL OVER...

59:42.655 --> 59:44.823
BOOM, EVAN PULLS
A GUN ON TERRY.

59:47.727 --> 59:49.427
YEAH, AS A D.A.,
I WOULDN'T PROSECUTE HIM.

59:49.462 --> 59:51.095
LET'S GO TALK TO HIM.
MAYBE HE'LL CONFESS.

59:51.131 --> 59:52.463
SHOULD I BE GOOD COP
OR BAD COP?

59:52.498 --> 59:54.098
LET'S BE LAWYERS.

59:55.202 --> 59:56.100
THAT'LL NEVER WORK.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.272
[MILES]: SO, THE LAST TIME
WE WERE HERE,

01:00:01.308 --> 01:00:02.340
WE ESTABLISHED

01:00:02.375 --> 01:00:03.674
THAT TERRY YASBECK
STOLE YOUR WIFE.

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:05.143
THAT'S FAIR TO SAY?

01:00:05.178 --> 01:00:06.110
HE COULDN'T STEAL HER.

01:00:06.146 --> 01:00:07.511
I DIDN'T OWN LINDA,
I WAS MARRIED TO HER,

01:00:07.547 --> 01:00:10.348
AND YEAH, SHE CHOSE
TERRY OVER ME,

01:00:10.383 --> 01:00:11.850
AND I LET HER GO,
END OF STORY.

01:00:11.885 --> 01:00:13.151
AND YOU DIDN'T
RESENT THAT AT ALL?

01:00:13.186 --> 01:00:16.221
I'VE PUT THAT ALL BEHIND ME.

01:00:16.256 --> 01:00:17.388
YOU SEEM AWFULLY FORGIVING
TOWARD TERRY YASBECK,

01:00:17.423 --> 01:00:18.356
I MEAN,

01:00:18.391 --> 01:00:19.257
COMPARED TO THE OTHER DAY
WHEN WE WERE HERE.

01:00:19.292 --> 01:00:22.126
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT.

01:00:22.162 --> 01:00:24.128
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SPOKEN
ABOUT HIM THAT WAY

01:00:24.164 --> 01:00:25.230
SO SOON AFTER...

01:00:25.265 --> 01:00:26.164
AFTER YOU KILLED HIM?

01:00:29.736 --> 01:00:31.569
LOOK, I DIDN'T KILL TERRY, OKAY?

01:00:31.604 --> 01:00:33.872
BUT YOU HAD
A REASON TO, RIGHT?.

01:00:36.176 --> 01:00:37.141
RIGHT, LOOK...

01:00:39.579 --> 01:00:40.979
I GUESS I SHOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED SHE TOLD YOU,

01:00:41.014 --> 01:00:42.513
SEEING AS HOW
YOU ARE HER BROTHER.

01:00:44.751 --> 01:00:46.217
SHE IS MY SISTER,

01:00:46.253 --> 01:00:48.152
BUT WE'D LIKE TO HEAR IT
COMING FROM YOU.

01:00:49.222 --> 01:00:51.689
ALL RIGHT.

01:00:51.724 --> 01:00:53.424
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOUR SISTER,

01:00:53.459 --> 01:00:57.195
AND WHEN I FOUND OUT
HOW TERRY WAS TREATING HER,

01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.230
AFTER WHAT HE DID TO ME...

01:00:59.266 --> 01:01:01.132
YEAH, I WAS ANGRY,
VERY ANGRY.

01:01:02.269 --> 01:01:03.701
SO YOU WENT
TO SEE HIM THAT NIGHT.

01:01:03.736 --> 01:01:05.270
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

01:01:05.305 --> 01:01:08.172
I DIDN'T...
UNTIL JUST NOW.

01:01:08.208 --> 01:01:10.775
YEAH, YEAH, OKAY,
I WENT TO SEE HIM,

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:12.877
BUT IT WAS JUST TO GET HER
OUT OF THE CONTRACT.

01:01:12.913 --> 01:01:15.413
I WANTED TO GET HER ALBUM BACK,
AND WE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT.

01:01:15.448 --> 01:01:16.514
AND?

01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:19.450
AND THAT'S IT.

01:01:19.485 --> 01:01:20.785
HE WOULDN'T DO EITHER.

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.020
HE JUST LAUGHED AT ME,

01:01:22.055 --> 01:01:24.522
SO I WENT HOME AND...

01:01:24.557 --> 01:01:26.224
YOU KNOW, I FIGURED I'D LET
THE LAWYERS HANDLE IT.

01:01:26.259 --> 01:01:27.225
AND THAT'S IT?

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.192
THAT'S IT.

01:01:29.896 --> 01:01:31.429
I DON'T BELIEVE
YOU, MR. CARLTON.

01:01:31.464 --> 01:01:33.264
WHAT DO YOU WANT, HUH?

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.399
DO YOU WANT TO LOOK
AT MY COMPUTER,

01:01:34.434 --> 01:01:35.400
SEE IF HER ALBUM'S THERE?

01:01:35.435 --> 01:01:37.101
WE DON'T HAVE
A WARRANT.

01:01:37.137 --> 01:01:38.970
YOU DON'T NEED ONE.
I'LL LOOK FOR YOU.

01:01:39.005 --> 01:01:40.538
HER ALBUM IS CALLED

01:01:40.573 --> 01:01:42.440
"JOURNEY TO
THE CENTER OF MY SOUL."

01:01:44.144 --> 01:01:45.876
<i>♪ BE MY RIDE OR DIE ♪</i>

01:01:45.912 --> 01:01:47.645
<i>♪ EVERY SINGLE DAY AND NIGHT ♪</i>

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.914
<i>♪ NEVER GONNA LEAVE

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:50.949
WELL, WELL.

01:01:50.984 --> 01:01:52.650
WHAT'S THAT, MR. CARLTON?

01:01:52.685 --> 01:01:53.884
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S HER ALBUM.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.885
- HOW DID IT GET THERE?
- I DON'T KNOW!

01:01:54.921 --> 01:01:56.421
- TERRY GIVE IT TO YOU?
- NO.

01:01:56.456 --> 01:01:57.956
MAYBE YOU TOOK IT...

01:01:57.991 --> 01:01:59.157
THE NIGHT
YOU KILLED HIM.

01:01:59.192 --> 01:02:02.060
<i>♪ I DON'T CARE IF THEY SAY
SLOW DOWN, TOO YOUNG ♪</i>

01:02:02.095 --> 01:02:03.461

<i>♪ BE MY RIDE OR DIE ♪</i>

01:02:14.387 --> 01:02:16.453
SO EVAN HAS MY ALBUM?

01:02:16.489 --> 01:02:17.554
THAT'S AMAZING.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.093
DO YOU KNOW
EVAN IS IN LOVE WITH YOU?

01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:26.463
YES.

01:02:26.499 --> 01:02:28.131
YES.

01:02:29.502 --> 01:02:30.734
ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HIM?

01:02:32.505 --> 01:02:33.470
YES.

01:02:33.506 --> 01:02:35.005
YES?

01:02:36.409 --> 01:02:38.208
WHY...

01:02:38.243 --> 01:02:40.110
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US THAT?

01:02:41.514 --> 01:02:43.013
I JUST, I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS IMPORTANT.

01:02:43.048 --> 01:02:45.315
OR WAS IT BECAUSE
YOU WERE PROTECTING HIM?

01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:48.084
WAS IT BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
THAT GAVE HIM A MOTIVE?

01:02:49.154 --> 01:02:50.186
DO YOU THINK

01:02:50.222 --> 01:02:53.023
EVAN CARLTON KILLED TERRY?

01:02:55.027 --> 01:02:57.327
I... I THINK
HE COULD HAVE...

01:02:57.362 --> 01:02:58.529
FOR ME.

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:15.512
[COACH]: OKAY, FELLAS,
THAT'S TWO-WAY!

01:03:15.548 --> 01:03:16.480
TWO-WAY, FELLAS!

01:03:17.783 --> 01:03:19.049
GOOD JOB!

01:03:19.084 --> 01:03:20.083
HE'S STILL NOT
PLAYING HER.

01:03:20.118 --> 01:03:21.418
HE'S GOING
TO PUT HER IN.

01:03:21.454 --> 01:03:22.285
HE'S JUST WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT TIME.

01:03:22.321 --> 01:03:24.688
HE'S ACTUALLY
A VERY REASONABLE GUY.

01:03:24.723 --> 01:03:25.856
YOU LIKED HIM?

01:03:25.891 --> 01:03:26.757
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

01:03:26.792 --> 01:03:28.826
I JUST SAID THAT
HE'S A REASONABLE GUY.

01:03:28.861 --> 01:03:31.194
YOU WEREN'T TALKING
ABOUT HIM THAT WAY

01:03:31.229 --> 01:03:33.664
BEFORE YOU GUYS
HAD COFFEE.

01:03:33.699 --> 01:03:34.865
WAIT A MINUTE...

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:37.434
YOU LIKE-LIKE HIM.

01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:38.936
I DON'T
LIKE-LIKE HIM.

01:03:38.971 --> 01:03:40.070
YES!

01:03:40.105 --> 01:03:41.171
NO, I JUST THINK

01:03:41.206 --> 01:03:43.006
THAT YOU AND I
MAYBE, UM...

01:03:43.041 --> 01:03:44.174
YOU KNOW, WE JUST
DIDN'T GIVE HIM

01:03:44.209 --> 01:03:45.108
THE BENEFIT
OF THE DOUBT.

01:03:45.143 --> 01:03:47.110
OH, BOY,
YOU REALLY LIKE HIM.

01:03:47.145 --> 01:03:48.745
YOU KNOW, I JUST...
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:50.046
WHY HE HASN'T
PUT HER IN YET.

01:03:50.082 --> 01:03:51.915
WELL, I DON'T CARE
IF YOU LIKE-LIKE HIM.

01:03:51.951 --> 01:03:52.916
IF HE DOESN'T PUT HER IN...

01:03:52.952 --> 01:03:53.750
I KNOW, YOU'RE GOING

01:03:53.786 --> 01:03:54.918
TO GIVE HIM A PIECE
OF YOUR MIND.

01:03:54.954 --> 01:03:56.086
DON'T THINK I WON'T!

01:03:56.121 --> 01:03:58.221
I'M SURE YOU WILL.

01:04:03.095 --> 01:04:04.628
[CLAIRE]:
IT'S THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH.

01:04:04.663 --> 01:04:06.363
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE
HASN'T PUT HER IN YET.

01:04:06.398 --> 01:04:07.698
HE PROMISED ME!

01:04:07.733 --> 01:04:09.232
GOOD TRY, BUDDY!

01:04:09.267 --> 01:04:10.934
GOOD TRY, HUEY!
WE GOT SOMEONE ON THIRD, BOYS.

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:13.103
WE GOT SOMEONE ON THIRD.

01:04:13.138 --> 01:04:14.638
HE'S NOT GOING
TO PLAY HER.

01:04:14.673 --> 01:04:16.339
TO THINK THAT
I LIKED THIS GUY!

01:04:19.177 --> 01:04:20.110
ALL RIGHT.

01:04:22.915 --> 01:04:24.214
WHAT'S HE DOING?

01:04:26.852 --> 01:04:27.851

WAS IT LIKE, "HEY, PHOEBE,"
OR WAS IT LIKE, "HEY, PHOEBE?"

01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:45.700
I DON'T KNOW.

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:46.867
OKAY, WHAT DID HE SAY NEXT?

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:49.704
HE SAID,
"PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU..."

01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:51.406
THANK YOU.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE.

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:52.307
DID IT SOUND SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:53.308
CHESTER.

01:11:54.511 --> 01:11:55.343
[TERRY]:
<i>I'M COMING HOME SOON, HON'.</i>

01:11:57.013 --> 01:11:57.845
<i>HEY, PHOEBE?
PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU...</i>

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.814
YES, YES.

01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:01.516
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:03.050
NON-DISCLOSURE.

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:05.720
HOW DID MS. DARROW GET
A COPY OF THAT PHONE CALL?

01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:06.854
I WAS WONDERING

01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:07.755
THE SAME THING, MS. DARROW.

01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:08.790
I DIDN'T.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:11.158
MY ASSOCIATE, CHESTER LIME,
PIECED IT TOGETHER

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:13.227
FROM BITS OF A CONVERSATION
ON A STUDIO TAPE.

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:16.698
SO THAT WASN'T THE CALL
THAT MRS. YASBECK HEARD?

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:19.334
ACTUALLY, THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT MRS. YASBECK HEARD

01:12:19.369 --> 01:12:21.536
BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT THE KILLER DID.

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:23.170
I OBJECT AGAIN.

01:12:23.206 --> 01:12:25.673
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO TAKE
MS. DARROW'S WORD FOR IT

01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:28.609
THAT THIS MAGICAL AUDIO TRICK
IS POSSIBLE?

01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:29.844
OBJECTION SUSTAINED!

01:12:29.879 --> 01:12:31.178
THAT'S MY JOB,

01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:32.313
MS. DARROW.

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:33.581
[CLAIRE]: I'M SORRY,
I WAS JUST TRYING TO SAVE TIME,

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:36.751
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO CALL
AN EXPERT ON AUDIO ENGINEERING.

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:39.420
I WOULD LIKE TO CALL
JONAH LAROCHELLE.

01:12:39.456 --> 01:12:40.855
[MUTTERING]

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:43.725
[CLAIRE]:
MR. LAROCHELLE,

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.926
IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION,

01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:48.929
COULD THE AUDIO HAVE BEEN
ALTERED IN THE WAY DESCRIBED?

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:50.297
I IMAGINE IT COULD.

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:52.433
COULD YOU HAVE MADE
THIS RECORDING YOURSELF?

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:53.468
I THINK I COULD HAVE.

01:12:53.503 --> 01:12:54.736
DID YOU MAKE THIS RECORDING?

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:56.303
I... NO!
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

01:12:56.339 --> 01:12:58.239
WELL, WHO WAS IN
A BETTER POSITION TO MAKE IT?

01:12:58.274 --> 01:12:59.407
PHOEBE.

01:12:59.442 --> 01:13:00.941
SHE USED TO BE MY ASSISTANT.

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:03.143
SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT
AUDIO ENGINEERING,

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:04.779
AND BESIDES, SHE TRIED
TO KILL ME, REMEMBER?

01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:05.813
SHE HIT ME ON THE HEAD

01:13:05.849 --> 01:13:07.615
AND THEN TRIED TO ASPHYXIATE ME
WITH MY OWN CAR.

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:09.116
[CLAIRE]:
OH, YES, THE CAR.

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:12.119
YOU WERE VERY LUCKY...

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:14.288
OR WERE YOU LUCKY?

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:15.390
MAYBE YOU WERE JUST... CAREFUL.

01:13:16.459 --> 01:13:17.492
OBJECTION.

01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:18.325
[JUDGE]:
I'M GOING TO ALLOW IT.

01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:19.827
I WANT TO SEE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

01:13:19.863 --> 01:13:21.629
DID YOU STAGE
THAT ASSAULT ON YOURSELF,

01:13:21.664 --> 01:13:23.297
MR. LAROCHELLE?

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:24.799
WHY ON EARTH WOULD I DO THAT?

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:26.901
TO DIVERT SUSPICION
FROM YOURSELF

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:27.835
AND MAKE IT LOOK

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:29.804
LIKE PHOEBE STRASBERG
TRIED TO KILL YOU.

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:31.071
OBJECTION!

01:13:31.107 --> 01:13:32.440
WITHDRAWN.

01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:34.308
TELL ME, I WANT TO SEE

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:37.612
IF YOU RECOGNIZE THIS OBJECT
WE'VE LABELED EXHIBIT C.

01:13:39.716 --> 01:13:41.248
SURE, IT'S A MIC STAND.

01:13:41.284 --> 01:13:42.283
WHICH MIC STAND?

01:13:42.318 --> 01:13:43.584
IT'S A MIC STAND.

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:44.786
THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE.

01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:45.986
I DON'T THINK SO.

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:47.588
THIS MIC STAND WAS FOUND

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:49.256
IN THE DUMPSTER
OF A CHINESE RESTAURANT

01:13:49.292 --> 01:13:50.792
THREE BLOCKS
FROM TERRY YASBECK'S STUDIO.

01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:52.259
DO YOU SEE THE RED CLIP?

01:13:52.295 --> 01:13:53.895
WHAT?

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:57.264
OH, YEAH, IT LOOKS
LIKE PHOEBE'S MIC STAND,

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.666
THE ONE THAT SHE ALWAYS LIKED.

01:13:58.701 --> 01:13:59.500
[CLAIRE]:
YOU ARE CORRECT.

01:13:59.536 --> 01:14:01.669
IN FACT, WE ARE
PREPARED TO PROVE

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:04.672
THAT THAT IS
PHOEBE'S MIC STAND,

01:14:04.707 --> 01:14:06.340
AND WE ARE ALSO
PREPARED TO PROVE

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.810
THAT THE INSIDE TUBE
OF THAT MIC STAND

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:10.445
AND THE RED CLIP

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.613
ARE BOTH COATED
WITH BRAKE FLUID--

01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:13.614
BRAKE FLUID

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:15.115
FROM A CAR...

01:14:15.151 --> 01:14:17.618
NOT UNLIKE YOURS,
MR. LAROCHELLE.

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:18.786
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.

01:14:18.822 --> 01:14:20.488
THE CONNECTION
BETWEEN THIS BRAKE FLUID

01:14:20.523 --> 01:14:21.789
AND THE BRAKE FLUID
IN MR. LAROCHELLE'S CAR...

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:23.724
[CLAIRE]:
HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.493
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU ARE CORRECT, MRS. ASHLAND,

01:14:25.528 --> 01:14:28.629
AND I DON'T THINK
IT CAN BE PROVEN...

01:14:28.665 --> 01:14:30.531
BUT IT IS INTERESTING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:31.799
NOT REALLY.

01:14:31.835 --> 01:14:33.668
BECAUSE SOMEBODY KNEW

01:14:33.703 --> 01:14:35.302
THAT THE STATE WOULD GIVE
PHOEBE STRASBERG

01:14:35.338 --> 01:14:36.403
A GUNSHOT-RESIDUE TEST

01:14:36.439 --> 01:14:38.072
AFTER TERRY YASBECK
WAS KILLED,

01:14:38.107 --> 01:14:39.306
AND THAT PERSON KNEW

01:14:39.342 --> 01:14:43.344
THAT BRAKE FLUID COULD CAUSE
A FALSE POSITIVE ON THE TEST.

01:14:43.379 --> 01:14:45.379
I MEAN, YOU CAN FIND THAT OUT
ON THE INTERNET...

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:46.313
AND THAT PERSON DID THAT

01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:49.550
BECAUSE THAT PERSON KILLED
TERRY YASBECK

01:14:49.586 --> 01:14:50.485
AND TRIED
TO FRAME PHOEBE STRASBERG

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.752
FOR THE CRIME.

01:14:51.788 --> 01:14:53.721
WELL, IT WASN'T ME.

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:54.689
I WAS WITH PHOEBE
AT THE NIGHTCLUB

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:55.690
WHEN TERRY WAS KILLED.

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:57.525
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.860
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHEN TERRY WAS KILLED?

01:14:58.895 --> 01:15:00.227
I DON'T.
YOU'RE CONFUSING ME.

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:01.195
DO I HAVE TO ANSWER?

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.396
YOU KIND OF DO.

01:15:03.967 --> 01:15:06.233
UH, COULD YOU REPEAT
THE QUESTION?

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:07.768
WITHDRAWN.

01:15:07.804 --> 01:15:09.103
I'D LIKE TO PLAY
THAT TAPE FOR YOU AGAIN.

01:15:09.138 --> 01:15:10.337
OBJECTION.

01:15:10.373 --> 01:15:11.572
[CLAIRE]: MR. LAROCHELLE
IS AN EXPERT.

01:15:11.608 --> 01:15:13.207
I WOULD LIKE HIS OPINION ON IT.

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:14.441
OVERRULED.

01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:15.242
PROCEED, MS. DARROW.

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:16.677
[CLAIRE]: THANK YOU,
YOUR HONOR.

01:15:16.713 --> 01:15:17.612
CHESTER?

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:19.113
READY.

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:20.715
[TERRY]:
<i>I'M COMING HOME SOON, HON'.</i>

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:22.683
<i>HEY, PHOEBE?
PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU--</i>

01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:24.284
WELL?

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.887
LIKE SHE SAID,
I'VE ALREADY HEARD IT.

01:15:25.922 --> 01:15:27.121
OH, BUT YOU HAVEN'T.

01:15:27.156 --> 01:15:28.856
THAT IS A DIFFERENT RECORDING.

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:29.991
THAT IS A RECORDING

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:33.260
THAT MY ASSOCIATE, CHESTER LIME,
WHO IS VERY THOROUGH,

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:35.563
FOUND ON TERRY YASBECK'S
STUDIO COMPUTER SYSTEM.

01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:37.632
WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:38.666
IT WAS REALLY HARD TO FIND.

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:40.034
HE HAD TO SEARCH THROUGH
ALL THESE DELETED FILES

01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:40.968
AND RECONSTRUCT IT.

01:15:41.004 --> 01:15:42.469
I DID.

01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:44.071
WE BELIEVE YOU, MR. LIME.

01:15:44.106 --> 01:15:44.972
[CLAIRE]: BUT IN THE END,
HE FOUND IT,

01:15:45.008 --> 01:15:47.642
BECAUSE COMPUTERS
ARE LIKE ELEPHANTS...

01:15:47.677 --> 01:15:48.676
THEY REMEMBER EVERYTHING...

01:15:50.446 --> 01:15:52.013
AND YOU KNOW WHOSE FILE
IT WAS DELETED FROM?

01:15:53.182 --> 01:15:54.214
NO.

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:55.282
IT WAS YOURS.

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:57.217
WHY'D YOU MAKE
THAT RECORDING?

01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:00.588
IT WAS A JOKE.

01:16:00.623 --> 01:16:01.822
WAS IT?

01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:03.524
I'M NOT LAUGHING,
MR. LAROCHELLE.

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:06.928
YOUR WIFE
IS PHOEBE'S BACKUP SINGER,

01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:08.395
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

01:16:08.431 --> 01:16:09.463
[JONAH]: YES.

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:10.464
ARE YOU AWARE
THAT YOUR WIFE

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:11.432
SENT TERRY YASBECK
AN EMAIL

01:16:11.467 --> 01:16:12.266
THE WEEK OF THE MURDER?

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.233
AN EMAIL?

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:14.735
WITH AN ATTACHMENT.

01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:16.771
I, I, I...
I SEEM TO REMEMBER SOMETHING.

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:19.506
SHE SENT HIM
AN E-MAIL OF HER SINGING.

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:21.341
IT WAS ONE OF PHOEBE'S SONGS.

01:16:21.377 --> 01:16:22.610
WHY DID SHE DO THAT?

01:16:22.645 --> 01:16:23.644
I THINK
HE REQUESTED IT.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.512
HMM, WELL...

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:27.615
HER E-MAIL
READS AS FOLLOWS...

01:16:27.650 --> 01:16:28.549
"I THINK I SING THIS SONG

01:16:28.585 --> 01:16:31.485
MUCH BETTER
THAN THAT NO-TALENT PHOEBE."

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.587
[LAUGHING]

01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:33.520
SHE WAS JOKING.

01:16:33.556 --> 01:16:35.022
WAS SHE?

01:16:35.058 --> 01:16:36.624
HERE'S TERRY'S REPLY.

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:37.692
"PATHETIC.

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:39.660
STICK TO BEING A BACK-UP SINGER.

01:16:39.696 --> 01:16:41.629
YOU CAN JUST BARELY DO THAT."

01:16:41.664 --> 01:16:42.997
HE WAS JOKING.

01:16:43.032 --> 01:16:44.632
HILARIOUS.
HOW DID YOUR WIFE REACT?

01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:45.800
SHE LAUGHED,

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:46.767
YOU KNOW.

01:16:46.803 --> 01:16:49.770
TELL ME, WHY WASN'T YOUR WIFE
AT THE CLUB

01:16:49.806 --> 01:16:50.805
THE NIGHT TERRY WAS MURDERED?

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.672
SHE WAS AT HOME.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:52.707
SHE WASN'T.

01:16:52.742 --> 01:16:54.609
WE HAVE SECURITY FOOTAGE

01:16:54.644 --> 01:16:56.477
FROM THE GAS STATION
AT YOUR CORNER.

01:16:56.512 --> 01:16:58.613
IT SHOWS NORAH LAROCHELLE
GETTING GAS

01:16:58.648 --> 01:17:01.515
AT 12:10 A.M.,
THAT EVENING.

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:03.050
NOW, WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT

01:17:03.086 --> 01:17:05.052
UNLESS SHE WAS COMING HOME
FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE?

01:17:05.088 --> 01:17:06.687
UNLESS SHE WENT OUT
JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT

01:17:06.723 --> 01:17:07.722
TO FILL THE TANK?

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:09.156
THAT.
SHE DID THAT.

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:11.225
OR WAS SHE COMING BACK
FROM TERRY YASBECK'S STUDIO?

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.292
SHE WASN'T.

01:17:12.328 --> 01:17:15.029
YOUR WIFE RESENTED
PHOEBE'S SUCCESS, DIDN'T SHE?

01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:16.430
SHE HATED BEING
A BACK-UP SINGER

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:17.898
JUST A FEW FEET FROM STARDOM.

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:20.400
SHE THOUGHT,
WITH PHOEBE OUT OF THE WAY,

01:17:20.436 --> 01:17:22.202
EVAN CARLTON WOULD MAKE HER
A BIG STAR.

01:17:22.238 --> 01:17:23.070
DIDN'T SHE?

01:17:23.106 --> 01:17:24.772
IS THAT WHY SHE KILLED
TERRY YASBECK?

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:25.673
OBJECTION!

01:17:25.708 --> 01:17:26.573
NO, SHE DIDN'T!

01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:27.842
I DID.
I SHOT HIM.

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:28.943
IT'S A TRICK,
YOU IDIOT!

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:29.944
SHUT UP!

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:30.911
ORDER!

01:17:30.947 --> 01:17:31.912
[JONAH]:
SHE KNOWS!

01:17:31.948 --> 01:17:32.880
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING!

01:17:32.915 --> 01:17:33.748
I KNOW WHAT,
JONAH?

01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:35.182
THAT YOUR WIFE
KILLED TERRY YASBECK,

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:36.250
AND YOU HELPED HER?

01:17:36.285 --> 01:17:37.718
YES. NO!

01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:38.953
I DID IT ALL BY MYSELF.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:39.887
[NORAH]:
NO, HE DIDN'T.

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:42.890
I DID IT.

01:17:42.925 --> 01:17:44.759
HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
UNTIL AFTERWARDS.

01:17:44.794 --> 01:17:47.094
[COURTROOM CHATTING]

01:17:56.572 --> 01:17:57.938
YOUR HONOR, CAN WE TALK?

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:10.751
- YAY, CLAIRE!
- CHEERS!

01:18:10.787 --> 01:18:11.752
THANK YOU.

01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:15.823
WELL, I DIDN'T LET YOU DOWN.

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:16.991
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:17.892
THANK YOU.

01:18:17.927 --> 01:18:19.326
YOU'RE SO WELCOME.

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.627
YOU'RE THE BEST.

01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:27.902
SO, USING A RECORDING
TO TIME-SHIFT THE MURDER,

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:29.804
SMEARING THE MIC STAND
WITH BRAKE FLUID...

01:18:29.839 --> 01:18:30.971
WHAT WOULD OCCAM THINK OF THAT?

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:33.974
I'D SAY...

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:35.743
HE'D PROBABLY THINK
IT WAS PRETTY COMPLICATED,

01:18:35.778 --> 01:18:36.977
BUT HE DID LIVE
IN THE 14TH CENTURY.

01:18:37.013 --> 01:18:39.413
MURDER WAS SIMPLER
BACK THEN.

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:40.781
CLAIRE?

01:18:40.817 --> 01:18:41.515
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.483
- THANK YOU.
- OH, OF COURSE.

01:18:43.519 --> 01:18:44.651
YOU ARE
A MIRACLE WORKER.

01:18:44.687 --> 01:18:45.720
I'M NOT.

01:18:45.755 --> 01:18:47.121
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT YOU
SUSPECTED ME FOR A MINUTE.

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:49.289
YEAH,
I TOTALLY DID,

01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:50.290
AND YOU KNOW,
I STILL DON'T KNOW

01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:51.625
HOW JONAH GOT PHOEBE'S ALBUM
ON YOUR COMPUTER,

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.459
BUT THAT WAS BRILLIANT.

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:54.294
WHAT ABOUT THE ACCIDENT
IN THE GARAGE?

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.530
STAGED TO DEFLECT
ATTENTION FROM JONAH.

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.365
NORAH HIT HIM ON THE HEAD
AND STARTED THE CAR.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.934
OH, SWEET COUPLE.

01:18:59.969 --> 01:19:01.635
AREN'T THEY?

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:02.803
HEY, WHERE'D YOUR BROTHER GO?

01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:04.471
UM, HE'S SOMEWHERE
AROUND HERE.

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:05.439
I'M NOT SURE.

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:06.473
OKAY.

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:07.608
THANK YOU!

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:10.711
[CLAIRE]:
MOM?

01:19:10.747 --> 01:19:12.446
GOOD JOB SETTLING
THAT LEMONADE CASE.

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:13.714
YEAH, I CALL IT

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:16.050
THE WHEN LIFE
GIVES YOU LEMONS AFFAIR.

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:17.818
YEAH, OKAY,
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

01:19:17.854 --> 01:19:20.020
WELL, ACTUALLY,
MAYBE I'M STILL WORKING ON THAT.

01:19:20.056 --> 01:19:20.921
OKAY...

01:19:20.957 --> 01:19:21.822
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
TO GO TO COURT.

01:19:21.858 --> 01:19:23.958
THAT'S THE BEST WAY
TO RESOLVE THINGS.

01:19:23.993 --> 01:19:25.893
I'M PROUD OF YOU,

01:19:25.928 --> 01:19:28.996
AND...
I'VE BEEN THINKING,

01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:29.930
AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE
OUR DIFFERENCES,

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:31.698
AND THERE ARE GOING
TO BE CHALLENGES AHEAD,

01:19:31.734 --> 01:19:35.035
BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO OFFER YOU...

01:19:35.071 --> 01:19:37.071
TO OFFER ME MORE CASES?

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:39.240
YEAH, I'D LIKE
TO OFFER YOU SOME MORE CASES.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.875
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE ME A PARTNER?

01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:42.476
ASSOCIATE.

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:43.477
WHAT IS WITH THE PARTNER?

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:45.012
OKAY, I CAN WAIT...

01:19:45.047 --> 01:19:46.513
BUT NOT TOO LONG.

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:47.481
HUG.

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:49.216
AW.

01:19:49.252 --> 01:19:50.584
AW, THANKS.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.352
OKAY.

01:19:52.388 --> 01:19:54.121
[LOUDLY CLEARING THROAT]

01:19:56.793 --> 01:19:57.992
OH, AND...

01:19:58.027 --> 01:19:59.894
GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY, GREAT.

01:19:59.929 --> 01:20:01.595
GREAT.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:02.529
GREAT WORK.

01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:13.274
AH...

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:14.775
HOMAGE.

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:15.742
TO THE VICTOR
GOES THE COFFEE.

01:20:15.778 --> 01:20:16.877
THANK YOU.

01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:17.912
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:20:17.947 --> 01:20:20.080
WELL...
YOU HAVE TO BUY ME ONE

01:20:20.116 --> 01:20:21.916
BECAUSE YOU WON,
BUT I WON, TOO.

01:20:21.951 --> 01:20:23.918
WE BOTH WON,
DIDN'T WE?

01:20:23.953 --> 01:20:26.753
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY,
YOU KNOW...

01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:29.790
YOU HAD FAITH,
AND I DIDN'T, NOT SO MUCH.

01:20:29.826 --> 01:20:32.092
YOU ALWAYS BELIEVED
SHE WAS INNOCENT.

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:34.061
YEAH, NO, I DIDN'T THINK
MY SISTER WAS A MURDERER.

01:20:34.096 --> 01:20:35.062
SO HOW COULD WE LOSE?

01:20:37.466 --> 01:20:39.033
YOU'RE...
YOU'RE AMAZING.

01:20:39.068 --> 01:20:40.067
SEE, I'M A D.A.

01:20:40.102 --> 01:20:41.235
I DON'T THINK LIKE THAT.

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:42.769
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD START.

01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:43.570
MAYBE THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:45.039
MAYBE I SHOULD START.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:20:45.074 --> 01:20:46.540
SO, DINNER,
SATURDAY NIGHT?

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:48.742
YEAH, LET'S DO IT,
BUT NO SHOP TALK, RIGHT?

01:20:48.777 --> 01:20:50.211
- NO SHOP TALK...
- OKAY.

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:51.145
FOR TEN MINUTES,

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.579
AND THEN MAYBE
SOME SHOP TALK.

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:55.282
TOO BAD WE DON'T HAVE
GRAPE SODA.

01:20:57.854 --> 01:20:58.819
YOU HAVE GRAPE SODA.

01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:00.154
I HAVE GRAPE SODA.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:01.121
WELL DONE, COUNSELOR.

01:21:01.157 --> 01:21:02.089
LET'S CELEBRATE,

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:13.334
YOU READY, MOM?

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:14.735
YES, JUST A SEC.

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:16.070
WELL, COME ON,
LET'S GO!

01:21:16.105 --> 01:21:18.005
YOUR DAUGHTER'S ABOUT

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.573
DON'T JINX ME!

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:20.807

01:21:20.843 --> 01:21:22.142
HE'S GOING TO LET ME
PITCH FOR A FEW INNINGS,

01:21:22.178 --> 01:21:23.277
YOU KNOW,
JUST SEE HOW I DO.

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:24.245
THAT IS GREAT.

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.812
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
NOTHING BUT STRIKE-OUTS.

01:21:25.848 --> 01:21:28.048
MOM, DON'T YOU JINX ME, TOO!

01:21:29.185 --> 01:21:31.085
SORRY, HONEY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO SAY?

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:35.089
JUST QUIET CONFIDENCE

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:40.660
THAT'S BETTER.

01:21:40.696 --> 01:21:42.829
GO ADEQUATE!

01:21:42.865 --> 01:21:44.498
HEY, WE NEVER HAD
OUR WEEKLY MEETING

01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:45.632
THIS WEEK.

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:49.436
OH, I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
GREAT ABOUT THIS WEEK.

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:50.437
ME FIRST.

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:51.872
UGH.

01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:54.275
MY PLAN IS TO PITCH WELL
IN TODAY'S GAME.

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:57.311
MY GOAL IS TO WRITE A GOOD PAPER
FOR MY SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS,

01:21:57.346 --> 01:21:59.914
AND MY ASPIRATION...

01:22:01.884 --> 01:22:02.816
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT ME TRYING OUT

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.318
FOR THE VARSITY FOOTBALL TEAM?

01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:06.020
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

01:22:06.055 --> 01:22:06.987
I'M KIDDING.

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:10.357
SHE GETS THIS
FROM YOU.

01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:13.794
I HAVE NEVER
BEEN MORE PROUD.
