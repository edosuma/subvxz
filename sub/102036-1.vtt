07:42.104 --> 07:43.706
Not before nine o'clock, Jack.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.540
I know.

07:46.542 --> 07:49.342
I'm so looking forward

07:49.344 --> 07:51.313
We get to find out
if it's Tony's baby

07:52.448 --> 07:53.782
or Tony's twin brother's.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.950
I think it's his twin brother's.

08:29.518 --> 08:31.454
Would you like to
do a workout, Jack?

08:33.522 --> 08:35.323
I'm going to be
lazy today, honey.

08:36.258 --> 08:37.257
But I'll watch you.

08:37.259 --> 08:38.093
You can teach me.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.961
Okay, well, it's
simple really.

08:40.963 --> 08:44.431
First of all we raise
to the tip of our toes

08:44.433 --> 08:46.266
and back down again.

08:46.268 --> 08:48.969
One, two, three, four,

08:48.971 --> 08:53.139
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.074
Okay.

08:54.076 --> 08:55.143
Then we lay on our side

08:56.612 --> 08:57.611
and we lift our leg.

08:57.613 --> 09:01.014
One, two, three,
four, five, six-

09:01.016 --> 09:02.451
- That is so cute.

09:05.721 --> 09:06.989
Do I look silly, Jack?

09:07.823 --> 09:08.657
Honey.

09:09.558 --> 09:10.857
No, you don't look silly.

09:10.859 --> 09:12.192
You look beautiful.

09:12.194 --> 09:13.496
You always look beautiful.

09:14.730 --> 09:15.962
I just thought maybe

09:15.964 --> 09:17.500
we could do nothing
together, that's all.

09:23.305 --> 09:25.874
No, Jack, I must get changed.

10:27.369 --> 10:29.570
I've been wanting to try
this new Bolognese sauce

10:29.572 --> 10:32.606
forever and ever, only
150 calories per serving

10:32.608 --> 10:34.176
and only $2 a jar.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.345
Would you like
mushrooms in it or not?

10:39.347 --> 10:41.114
I think I'll pass, honey.

10:41.116 --> 10:44.985
I'm not really a huge fan
of mushrooms if that's okay.

10:44.987 --> 10:46.889
Mushrooms it is then.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.125
Okay.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.399
You know, Ria, apart
from the mushrooms,

10:59.401 --> 11:02.502
this pasta is probably the
best I've ever had in my life.

11:02.504 --> 11:04.707
- Thank you, Jack.
- Delicious.

11:06.909 --> 11:07.743
More wine?

11:16.852 --> 11:17.718
Cheers.

11:26.161 --> 11:29.329
So are you looking forward
to your show tonight?

11:29.331 --> 11:30.530
Of course.

11:30.532 --> 11:31.934
I've been waiting all week.

11:33.636 --> 11:34.469
I know.

11:35.671 --> 11:37.205
Well, I had an idea.

11:38.874 --> 11:40.807
I was thinking instead of you
watching your show this week

11:40.809 --> 11:42.042
like you do every week

11:42.044 --> 11:44.344
maybe we can do
something different,

11:44.346 --> 11:46.048
something fun just
the two of us.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.392
I think I'll watch
my soap after all.

12:00.896 --> 12:01.730
Of course.

12:23.285 --> 12:25.986
This washing up liquid
lasts forever and ever.

12:25.988 --> 12:29.089
I certainly believe the
manufacturers and...

12:29.091 --> 12:29.925
Honey.

12:33.862 --> 12:36.198
I think I'm gonna wait in
the other room for you okay?

12:44.740 --> 12:47.741
Oh my God, Steve, we
can't keep doing this.

12:47.743 --> 12:48.942
What?

12:48.944 --> 12:50.510
It doesn't matter
what we want.

12:50.512 --> 12:53.579
We're hurting people,
people that we love.

12:53.581 --> 12:55.248
Don't you think I know that?

12:55.250 --> 12:57.684
Don't you think I know
I should stay away?

12:57.686 --> 12:58.586
I just can't.

13:00.088 --> 13:02.655
Oh, my brother is the
luckiest man alive.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.726
He doesn't even know it.

13:05.728 --> 13:07.794
I can't,
Tony, oh, Steve.

13:07.796 --> 13:09.231
I can't do this.

13:10.232 --> 13:12.098
Look, if I go, Beth,

13:12.100 --> 13:13.800
you know you'll never
see me again, right?

13:13.802 --> 13:15.035
Thank you.

13:15.037 --> 13:16.036
I just couldn't
bear to see my child

13:16.038 --> 13:17.470
being brought up by him.

13:17.472 --> 13:19.605
So what, you want
me to just leave him?

13:19.607 --> 13:20.874
Yes.

13:20.876 --> 13:21.808
Your brother's not
that bad, you know.

13:21.810 --> 13:23.076
After all, he has put a roof

13:23.078 --> 13:25.245
over both of our heads.

13:25.247 --> 13:26.947
Well, if
that's what you want,

13:26.949 --> 13:27.981
you don't want me.

13:27.983 --> 13:28.915
Yes.

13:28.917 --> 13:29.916
No.

13:29.918 --> 13:31.785
You just don't get it, okay?

13:31.787 --> 13:32.786
Get what?

13:32.788 --> 13:34.356
Oh, Steve.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.993

20:24.832 --> 20:27.267
and we do 10 donkey kicks.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.934
One, two...

20:57.732 --> 20:59.465
I'm been wanting to try
this new cooking sauce

20:59.467 --> 21:00.966
forever and ever.

21:00.968 --> 21:04.270
Only a hundred calories
per serving and $3 a jar.

21:04.272 --> 21:05.238
Cook these for me, bitch.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.106
I want fries, do you hear me?

21:07.108 --> 21:08.710
Don't make me get fucking angry.

21:09.811 --> 21:11.344
Fries it is.

21:11.346 --> 21:12.447
Got another request.

21:13.548 --> 21:15.615
I want you to dress
up for dinner.

21:17.585 --> 21:20.085
Hey, this food's okay, baby.

21:20.087 --> 21:23.223
But I'd so much
rather throw it at you.

21:27.562 --> 21:28.396
Oh, so close.

21:30.898 --> 21:31.731
Uh.

21:31.733 --> 21:33.165
Tony.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.033
What?

21:34.035 --> 21:35.301
Why are you back?

21:35.303 --> 21:36.802
I thought you were
gone for the day.

21:36.804 --> 21:37.639
Clearly.

21:38.606 --> 21:39.907
Now, what's going on here?

21:42.644 --> 21:43.445
Steve?

21:44.579 --> 21:45.380
What?

21:47.148 --> 21:48.783
Okay, bro, listen.

21:50.585 --> 21:53.453
Me and Beth have been seeing
each other for a while now.

21:53.455 --> 21:54.720
What?

21:54.722 --> 21:55.721
We wanted
to tell you before.

21:55.723 --> 21:57.290
It's just with the baby-

21:57.292 --> 21:58.691
Right, shut up!

21:58.693 --> 22:00.192
Just just shut up.

22:00.194 --> 22:01.294
How long?

22:01.296 --> 22:02.428
About a year.

22:02.430 --> 22:03.529
And the baby?

22:03.531 --> 22:04.830
Whose is it?

22:04.832 --> 22:06.766
It doesn't
matter, okay?

22:06.768 --> 22:07.933
You're its dad.

22:07.935 --> 22:10.202
Course it matters!

22:10.204 --> 22:15.209
And I repeat...

22:17.745 --> 22:18.746
Whose is it?

22:34.862 --> 22:38.163
Ria,
give him something.

34:54.468 --> 34:55.500
Come

34:55.502 --> 34:56.301
- Hey, wait!

34:56.303 --> 34:57.236
Is this it?

34:57.238 --> 34:58.970
What do you mean "is this it"?

34:58.972 --> 35:01.473
I don't mean to
be rude but so far

35:01.475 --> 35:03.842
this whole experience
is not what I expected.

35:03.844 --> 35:06.045
I won the grand prize.

35:06.047 --> 35:07.512
I don't get what
you mean, mate.

35:07.514 --> 35:08.947
I was driven all
the way out here

35:08.949 --> 35:11.950
by that rude son of a
bitch who you call a driver

35:11.952 --> 35:14.386
and he didn't give
me any instructions

35:14.388 --> 35:15.320
on what I was supposed
to do tonight.

35:15.322 --> 35:16.688
I know, it's okay, sir.

35:16.690 --> 35:18.223
- All you need to do-
- Oh, come on.

35:18.225 --> 35:20.859
is get into bed, get some
sleep, and in the morning

35:20.861 --> 35:22.561
everything will be clear.

35:22.563 --> 35:24.198
I don't
know about that.

35:44.118 --> 35:45.350
Good morning!

35:45.352 --> 35:47.819
It is Monday, the
19th of March, 2040

35:47.821 --> 35:50.789
and we have two
very special guests,

35:50.791 --> 35:53.525
Mitchell Lawrence and
Robert Stewart-Oaten

35:53.527 --> 35:56.395
creators and respective
producer and director

35:56.397 --> 35:58.397
of "A Day with Ria".

35:58.399 --> 35:59.664
Good morning.

35:59.666 --> 36:00.465
Morning.

36:00.467 --> 36:01.233
Thanks for having us.

36:01.235 --> 36:02.434
No worries.

36:02.436 --> 36:05.070
So it's been four
years and five series

36:05.072 --> 36:08.740
and the show just keeps
getting better and better.

36:08.742 --> 36:11.076
Mitchell, tell me,
what is the secret?

36:11.078 --> 36:13.645
Well, it's actually quite
hard for me to answer.

36:14.748 --> 36:16.548
It's the guest stars we have

36:16.550 --> 36:18.217
and the scenarios we put them in

36:18.219 --> 36:21.486
that makes it very
watchable and unique.

36:21.488 --> 36:23.755
Now, Robert, you
have won countless awards

36:23.757 --> 36:26.458
for your directorial
style during the show.

36:26.460 --> 36:28.760
But, at the same time,
you've been criticized

36:28.762 --> 36:32.631
for creating a show that
some say runs itself.

36:32.633 --> 36:35.600
True, but what most
people fail to understand

36:35.602 --> 36:38.137
is the complexity and
ever-changing nature

36:38.139 --> 36:39.304
of an unscripted show.

36:39.306 --> 36:41.773
I mean sure, Ria
follows her own script

36:41.775 --> 36:44.909
but the contestants or
husbands, if you like,

36:44.911 --> 36:47.646
I mean, we never know
what they're going to do.

36:47.648 --> 36:49.481
Yes, of course.

36:49.483 --> 36:52.251
So how on Earth do you
keep track of everything

36:52.253 --> 36:53.652
that goes on in that house?

36:53.654 --> 36:55.387
With a lot of skill and aided

36:55.389 --> 36:57.489
by the most
up-to-date technology.

36:57.491 --> 37:01.160
We have about 250 cameras
planted all over the house

37:01.162 --> 37:04.229
some as high def
and precise as this.

37:04.231 --> 37:06.898
- Oh!
- And others as small

37:06.900 --> 37:09.468
and discrete as this.

37:10.637 --> 37:12.237
This little camera

37:12.239 --> 37:16.941
is 8K in quality and my
absolute favorite to shoot with.

37:16.943 --> 37:19.878
The others are so big and
obtrusive that the husbands

37:19.880 --> 37:21.380
always know they're on.

37:21.382 --> 37:25.116
Whereas those little babies,
so small and unobtrusive,

37:25.118 --> 37:27.486
you get to the real
soul of a contributor.

37:27.488 --> 37:29.821
Come on, you're not
into "Ria" are ya?

37:29.823 --> 37:30.655
Shh.

37:30.657 --> 37:31.856
I love it.

37:31.858 --> 37:33.158
It's my one and only
guilty pleasure.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.393
The only one?

37:34.395 --> 37:35.296
Well.

37:36.663 --> 37:39.766
Hey, Jess, I was
wondering if...

37:41.134 --> 37:43.034
Sorry, John, you were saying.

37:45.939 --> 37:48.907
Vice President Flemming is
also a fan of "A Day with Ria".

37:48.909 --> 37:51.543
As Vice President Chief
of Staff, you know full well

37:51.545 --> 37:53.347
I couldn't possibly
comment on that.

37:55.349 --> 37:57.015
Now the audience
are in control,

37:57.017 --> 37:59.718
voting over everything
that happens in the house

37:59.720 --> 38:02.354
from what Ria wears that
day to what they both eat.

38:02.356 --> 38:04.856
In fact, every time
there is a question

38:04.858 --> 38:07.426
or a decision
posed in the house,

38:07.428 --> 38:11.530
Ria and the audience are
integral to the process.

38:11.532 --> 38:14.966
So now we have a little
VT that viewers have RIAPPed

38:14.968 --> 38:17.869
most popular contributor
of the series.

38:21.708 --> 38:22.641
Okay, stop the car.

38:22.643 --> 38:23.908
Okay, so I washed the dishes,

38:23.910 --> 38:25.143
I vacuumed, and then I
dusted the whole house

38:25.145 --> 38:27.045
all whilst wearing
this ridiculous outfit.

38:27.848 --> 38:29.281
Congratulations, Jack.

38:29.283 --> 38:31.115
You have won the right to
request anything you like of me.

38:31.117 --> 38:33.352
Uh, uh, I would like
to sing you a song, Ria,

38:33.354 --> 38:34.255
if that's okay.

38:35.389 --> 38:37.522
Your request
has been accepted.

year, that's for sure.

40:01.342 --> 40:02.841
Absolutely.

40:02.843 --> 40:06.978
By the way, I am obsessed with
the 1950s theme this series.

40:06.980 --> 40:09.614
The attention to
detail is just amazing.

40:09.616 --> 40:11.883
So now I have to ask,

40:11.885 --> 40:14.252
do you think I'd look
good in a Ria dress?

40:14.254 --> 40:17.456
Erika, you would look
good in just about anything.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.458
Oh, stop it, you.

40:19.460 --> 40:21.192
Well,
the details are-

40:21.194 --> 40:23.428
- Nothing on, audiences
love about the show.

40:23.430 --> 40:26.731
Oh, in fact I can exclusively
reveal that next season,

40:26.733 --> 40:27.566
we're gonna be doing something

40:27.568 --> 40:29.334
a little different.

40:29.336 --> 40:31.636
Every day Ria spends
with a husband

40:31.638 --> 40:33.638
will be Christmas Day.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.874
It should
be a lotta fun.

40:35.876 --> 40:39.478
Yeah, definitely for the
viewer and even the husband.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.946
But what about Ria?

40:43.684 --> 40:45.183
What about her?

40:45.185 --> 40:47.185
Well, again, in the past
you've been criticized

40:47.187 --> 40:50.989
with, well, with people
calling the show inhumane.

40:58.399 --> 40:59.831
Good one.

40:59.833 --> 41:02.333
I'm not even gonna
dignify that with an answer.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.671
Well, Robert and
Mitchell, thank you so much

41:06.673 --> 41:08.239
for coming in this morning.

41:08.241 --> 41:10.174
And for fans of
"A Day with Ria",

41:10.176 --> 41:13.011
you can catch this morning's
episode in 30 minutes

41:13.013 --> 41:14.946
right here on Channel Six.

41:29.162 --> 41:30.361
Good
morning, viewers.

41:30.363 --> 41:32.296
It's 7:03 a.m.

41:32.298 --> 41:34.535
Ria wakes up to a new day.

41:36.336 --> 41:39.806
It's now time for you to have
your first choice of the day.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.674
Please use the RIAPP to choose

41:42.676 --> 41:45.877
the Scarlet Fever or
the Cinderella lipstick

41:45.879 --> 41:48.046
from Fab Cosmetics.

41:48.048 --> 41:49.514
Good morning, world.

41:49.516 --> 41:51.483
What fun-filled adventures
do you have in store

41:51.485 --> 41:53.017
for me today?

41:53.019 --> 41:55.053
You can also
suggest the daily chores

41:55.055 --> 41:56.056
through the app, too.

42:00.994 --> 42:04.463
Ria, now back in the bedroom,
is ready to get dressed.

42:04.465 --> 42:06.565
By the way, ladies,
if you like anything

42:06.567 --> 42:09.668
Ria is wearing from
underwear to outerwear,

42:09.670 --> 42:12.170
remember, you can find
the details of the items

42:12.172 --> 42:13.574
on our website.

42:42.569 --> 42:43.502
You okay, Mitch?

42:43.504 --> 42:44.302
You haven't said much tonight.

42:44.304 --> 42:45.103
Yeah, I'm fine.

42:45.105 --> 42:46.337
I'm just goddamn pissed

42:46.339 --> 42:47.639
at that presenter
bitch this morning.

42:47.641 --> 42:49.841
And I know there
will always be idiots

42:49.843 --> 42:51.643
protesting against Ria.

42:51.645 --> 42:53.444
True, but I kinda
got used to it.

42:53.446 --> 42:54.846
I just thought you had.

42:54.848 --> 42:56.114
Of course I have.

42:56.116 --> 42:57.081
But the producers of
"The Morning Show"

42:57.083 --> 42:58.650
promised me an easier ride.

42:58.652 --> 43:00.785
Well, as long as it doesn't
decrease our viewing figures.

43:00.787 --> 43:03.054
You
gotta be kidding.

43:03.056 --> 43:06.727
No, actually, the more
controversy the better.

43:08.228 --> 43:09.963
Thank you for
reminding me of that.

43:11.498 --> 43:15.867
That bitch this
morning helped us out after all.

43:17.103 --> 43:19.838
I bet you those idiots
screaming "free Ria"

43:19.840 --> 43:22.907
watch her every minute
of every goddamn day

43:22.909 --> 43:24.408
and obsess over it.

43:25.579 --> 43:26.511
They're hypocrites.

43:26.513 --> 43:27.779
Hmm.

43:27.781 --> 43:29.013
You're right.

43:29.015 --> 43:30.849
Of course I am.

43:30.851 --> 43:32.152
Hey, trust me on this one.

43:33.453 --> 43:35.386
The more drama we bring,

43:35.388 --> 43:37.188
the more people
will be against it

43:37.190 --> 43:40.424
and the more people
will watch it

43:40.426 --> 43:42.195
and will love it.

44:25.538 --> 44:27.572
So you excited about tomorrow?

44:27.574 --> 44:29.007
Of course.

44:29.009 --> 44:30.341
It's been a long time coming.

44:30.343 --> 44:31.309
Awesome, man.

44:31.311 --> 44:32.777
Got anything special planned

44:32.779 --> 44:34.746
or are you just gonna
improvise the whole thing?

44:34.748 --> 44:36.981
Well, they did suggest
to have a party piece

44:36.983 --> 44:39.720
but I think I'm
just gonna wing it.

45:00.607 --> 45:01.541
Come on in.

45:03.243 --> 45:05.644
Mr. Vice President,
I have some files here

45:05.646 --> 45:06.845
that need your attention.

45:06.847 --> 45:08.346
Great.

45:08.348 --> 45:10.717
There's also an email
that is addressed to you.

45:11.685 --> 45:12.617
What does it say?

45:12.619 --> 45:14.185
Honestly I don't know, sir.

45:14.187 --> 45:16.454
For one, it's locked under
your personal security code

45:16.456 --> 45:18.556
and when we looked
into the IP address,

45:18.558 --> 45:21.325
it flagged up as probably
coming from your son.

45:21.327 --> 45:22.696
We felt it must be private.

45:25.065 --> 45:26.698
All right.

45:26.700 --> 45:28.466
Well, thank you, Jess.

45:28.468 --> 45:30.068
That'll be all for tonight.

45:30.070 --> 45:31.171
Have a good evening.

45:42.482 --> 45:43.848
- Hey, what the-
- Oh my gosh!

45:43.850 --> 45:44.783
Look at that.

45:44.785 --> 45:46.184
You have to watch it.

45:48.889 --> 45:49.888
Hey!

45:49.890 --> 45:51.289
Hey, what are we
doing here, huh?

45:51.291 --> 45:52.323
Just having fun?

45:52.325 --> 45:53.692
Hey, I'm sorry, sir.

45:53.694 --> 45:55.295
- I didn't mean it.
- Oh my God.

45:56.129 --> 45:58.965
No, no.

46:02.202 --> 46:04.969
Right, the next one
will have to be a hit

46:04.971 --> 46:07.271
and elevate our figures
through the roof.

46:07.273 --> 46:08.840
I want drama, I want scandal.

46:08.842 --> 46:13.011
I want viewers on the edges
of their fucking seats!

46:13.013 --> 46:15.446
Well, you're gonna
love this guy then.

46:15.448 --> 46:16.848
The background checks came back

46:16.850 --> 46:19.617
with something fairly
interesting about him.

46:19.619 --> 46:20.584
Oh really?

46:20.586 --> 46:21.853
Like what?

46:21.855 --> 46:23.722
He gave us a false identity.

46:23.724 --> 46:26.126
He told us his name
was Jason Sampson.

46:27.560 --> 46:32.098
Okay, but why and who is
he and should I be worried?

46:32.833 --> 46:33.433
I don't think so.

46:34.534 --> 46:36.467
His real name is Flemming.

46:36.469 --> 46:38.502
I don't understand.

46:38.504 --> 46:40.306
Robert shouting,
"Geez he's a pig."

46:42.142 --> 46:43.407
You don't mean he's related

46:43.409 --> 46:45.676
to Vice President
Joseph Flemming?

46:45.678 --> 46:46.778
Yeah.

46:46.780 --> 46:47.613
It's his son.

46:49.549 --> 46:53.451
Shit.

46:53.453 --> 46:54.287
Exactly.

46:55.188 --> 46:56.320
Hey, where is he?

46:56.322 --> 46:57.688
I wanna speak to him.

46:57.690 --> 46:59.223
Well, he just left in the car.

46:59.225 --> 47:01.926
Okay, well, let's get him
on the phone then shall we?

47:01.928 --> 47:05.463
I was
there for three hours.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.066
That'll be for you, Jack.

47:08.068 --> 47:10.468
It's always for the main
contributor of the day.

47:10.470 --> 47:11.702
Hello and welcome.

47:11.704 --> 47:13.237
I'm Robert, the show's director.

47:13.239 --> 47:15.473
And this is Mitchell,
the producer.

47:15.475 --> 47:16.741
Hi, I'm-

47:16.743 --> 47:17.942
- Jack.

47:17.944 --> 47:19.443
And yes, we know
who you are really.

47:19.445 --> 47:22.146
But that doesn't change
the fact that from now on

47:22.148 --> 47:25.149
you're Jack so you
better get used to it.

47:25.151 --> 47:26.985
Oh, yeah, sure.

47:26.987 --> 47:28.853
Few things before
we take you in.

47:28.855 --> 47:31.890
You probably know them
but the rules are simple.

47:31.892 --> 47:33.657
No tech is allowed.

47:33.659 --> 47:36.460
No phones, no IPAs, no headsets,

47:36.462 --> 47:39.663
no computer bracelets,
absolutely nothing.

47:39.665 --> 47:42.366
All phones and TV in
the house are fake.

47:42.368 --> 47:43.667
Don't reveal the truth to her.

47:43.669 --> 47:45.738
Spoils the illusion
for everybody else.

47:47.240 --> 47:52.076
No swearing, sex, or violence
before 9:00 p.m. at all.

47:52.078 --> 47:53.577
It just won't be broadcast.

47:53.579 --> 47:55.780
Now, go in there
and give us something new,

47:55.782 --> 47:57.481
something we
haven't seen before,

47:57.483 --> 48:00.785
something that will make
you a star of the season.

48:00.787 --> 48:03.521
Or even of the entire
history of "A Day with Ria".

48:03.523 --> 48:06.192
Push the boundaries,
make it a party.

48:07.327 --> 48:09.360
Get out from under
your father's shadow.

48:09.362 --> 48:10.594
Imagine you come
outta the show

48:10.596 --> 48:14.165
and the whole world cheers.

48:14.167 --> 48:15.266
They wanna party with you.

48:15.268 --> 48:18.071
It's your show, not hers.

48:19.505 --> 48:20.704
The cleaning
crew in the car with you

48:20.706 --> 48:24.508
will erase all memories
of the last Jack.

48:24.510 --> 48:26.110
You got a clean start.

48:26.112 --> 48:26.947
Go hit it, son.

48:27.914 --> 48:29.580
I certainly will.

48:29.582 --> 48:30.650
Hmm, that's the spirit.

48:32.052 --> 48:35.954
Okay one last form
for you to fingerprint

48:35.956 --> 48:38.358
then we'll take you into
the secret location,

48:39.559 --> 48:42.360
Ria and Jack's house.

48:46.967 --> 48:47.798
One last thing.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.467
What about my list?

48:49.469 --> 48:52.003
Your list of requirements,
likes, dislikes,

48:52.005 --> 48:54.839
food, sexual preferences,

48:54.841 --> 48:56.875
they're all taken care of.

48:56.877 --> 48:59.643
Now go in there, son,
and give us a good show.

48:59.645 --> 49:00.746
We'll be watching.

49:04.184 --> 49:05.018
Thank you.

49:07.120 --> 49:08.719
Oh, I have got a good
feeling about this one.

49:08.721 --> 49:12.156
Now, how do we play the press?

49:12.158 --> 49:15.261
We gotta let them know
the VP's son in our house

49:16.129 --> 49:17.597
without letting them know.

49:18.965 --> 49:20.066
It's better rank 'cause
we won't cover some 33821.

49:21.634 --> 49:22.735
Who's your dad?

49:24.270 --> 49:26.907
Um, no one really.

49:35.015 --> 49:36.814
You okay down there?

49:36.816 --> 49:40.251
Oh, yeah, just
little bit of cramp.

49:40.253 --> 49:42.222
Happens in the car sometimes.

49:57.203 --> 49:58.402
Sir?

49:58.404 --> 49:59.670
Good, Jess, you
haven't gone home yet.

49:59.672 --> 50:00.939
Can you come back to
the office please?

50:00.941 --> 50:01.774
Course, sir.

50:02.675 --> 50:04.042
Is that John?

50:04.044 --> 50:04.909
Bring him along as well.

50:04.911 --> 50:06.010
Okay.

50:06.012 --> 50:06.846
John!

50:11.017 --> 50:14.454
And we have arrived
at the destination.

50:16.222 --> 50:17.057
Oh my God!

50:17.924 --> 50:19.490
It reads like a goodbye letter.

50:19.492 --> 50:20.826
What are you gonna do, sir?

50:22.028 --> 50:22.862
I don't know.

50:24.897 --> 50:27.798
What do you know about this
show, "A Day with Ria"?

50:27.800 --> 50:30.168
Only that it's the most
popular piece of entertainment

50:30.170 --> 50:31.902
on the planet.

50:31.904 --> 50:34.707
When was the last time
you saw your son, sir?

50:36.842 --> 50:38.044
It's been a while.

50:39.712 --> 50:42.213
Look, the only thing I'm really
concerned about right now

50:42.215 --> 50:44.015
is protecting this
administration

50:44.017 --> 50:45.685
and keeping this quiet.

50:46.852 --> 50:48.819
I assume he's gonna
be on tomorrow?

50:48.821 --> 50:50.554
Judging by this letter yes.

50:50.556 --> 50:52.823
But I don't think we
should rush in too hard.

50:52.825 --> 50:54.125
Why not?

50:54.127 --> 50:55.726
The show never reveals
a contestant's identity

50:55.728 --> 50:58.329
so why not see how
this plays out?

50:58.331 --> 51:00.631
Don't think he's planning
anything drastic.

51:00.633 --> 51:02.666
Certainly this letter doesn't
prove this is gonna be

51:02.668 --> 51:05.103
a problem for you
or the president.

51:05.105 --> 51:06.704
I agree, sir.

51:06.706 --> 51:08.572
Besides, the production
company may not even know

51:08.574 --> 51:10.108
he's your son.

51:10.110 --> 51:11.942
And if they get the slightest
hint there's something wrong,

51:11.944 --> 51:14.678
then if anything, our
action rather than inaction

51:14.680 --> 51:15.748
may go against us.

51:19.219 --> 51:22.186
I don't like it but fine.

51:22.188 --> 51:25.423
But this stays right here
between the three of us.

51:25.425 --> 51:27.791
There's no reason for the
president to be alerted

51:27.793 --> 51:28.961
about this, not yet.

51:32.232 --> 51:33.333
That's all, thank you.

51:41.607 --> 51:42.575
Good night, Ria.

52:23.183 --> 52:24.648
Good
morning, everyone.

52:24.650 --> 52:26.150
The time is 7:03

52:26.152 --> 52:27.385
and our gorgeous Ria

52:27.387 --> 52:29.353
is waking up to a fresh day.

52:29.355 --> 52:30.721
Isn't she beautiful?

52:30.723 --> 52:31.955
Get ready, viewers.

52:31.957 --> 52:34.358
It's now time for your
first choice of the day.

52:34.360 --> 52:35.559
Make it a good one.

52:35.561 --> 52:37.961
Use the RIAPP to
choose the Red Devil

52:37.963 --> 52:40.431
or the Purple Rose lipstick

52:40.433 --> 52:43.067
from our friends
at Fab Cosmetics.

52:43.069 --> 52:44.502
Good morning, world.

52:44.504 --> 52:46.437
What fun-filled adventures
do you have in store

52:46.439 --> 52:48.772
- for me today?
- Just you wait and see.

52:48.774 --> 52:50.841
Don't forget, viewers,
you can also suggest

52:50.843 --> 52:52.845
the daily chores
through the app as well.

53:00.386 --> 53:01.919
Come on, sleepy head.

53:01.921 --> 53:03.154
Wakey, wakey.

53:03.156 --> 53:04.957
We've got a whole day of
fun to get started on.

53:06.792 --> 53:08.194
Ah, tea.

53:09.629 --> 53:10.463
Lovely.

53:11.897 --> 53:13.664
Now you have your tea and
I'll get breakfast ready.

53:13.666 --> 53:16.136
What would you like, full
English or continental?

53:19.505 --> 53:21.004
Wait.

53:21.006 --> 53:21.939
Hey, what's happened?

53:28.314 --> 53:29.313
What the fuck just happened?

53:29.315 --> 53:30.681
We lost the signal!

53:30.683 --> 53:32.550
I can see that, jackass!

53:32.552 --> 53:35.119
We have never in the
history of the show

53:35.121 --> 53:36.454
- lost a fucking signal!
- Hustle!

53:36.456 --> 53:37.621
- There's no NI.
- What do you mean

53:37.623 --> 53:39.089
we lost the goddamn signal?

53:39.091 --> 53:40.324
Let me see.

53:40.326 --> 53:41.792
Okay, we're
trying, we're trying.

53:41.794 --> 53:43.127
- We're trying everything-
- Are we still on air?

53:43.129 --> 53:47.565
- Oh goddamn it!
- We're trying, we're trying!

53:47.567 --> 53:50.868
What do you mean you
don't fucking know?

53:50.870 --> 53:52.035
Read my lips.

53:52.037 --> 53:54.805
Are we still on air?

53:54.807 --> 53:56.006
I don't know.

53:56.008 --> 53:57.074
Listen,
I'm trying, listen

53:59.111 --> 54:00.378
We have everything
off with no explanation.

54:00.380 --> 54:03.314
Thank God we hadn't
gone to the press yet.

54:03.316 --> 54:05.082
- The color bars are off air-
- Huh, yeah.

54:05.084 --> 54:08.552
You're just gonna
end up back directing

54:08.554 --> 54:11.324
shitty little
commercials and all that.

54:12.492 --> 54:13.724
That's it, commercial.

54:13.726 --> 54:15.226
Hey, play a commercial.

54:15.228 --> 54:17.595
Now, playing the
washing lotion commercial.

54:17.597 --> 54:18.562
I didn't allow
myself to hear it.

54:18.564 --> 54:19.797
20 seconds left.

54:19.799 --> 54:21.765
Cuing the garden splash stock.

54:21.767 --> 54:23.801
In the next five minutes,

54:23.803 --> 54:24.735
Oh shit.

54:24.737 --> 54:27.271
I want the TV show to air,

54:27.273 --> 54:30.741
answers to what just
fucking happened.

54:30.743 --> 54:33.311
- Three-
- And an extra hot cappuccino.

54:33.313 --> 54:34.512
- Two, one.
- I'll have one, too.

54:34.514 --> 54:36.347
Get
this guy a coffee.

54:36.349 --> 54:37.183
Now!

54:40.786 --> 54:41.619
You know what?

54:41.621 --> 54:42.886
It's off the air.

54:42.888 --> 54:44.355
I don't know how and
I don't know if this

54:44.357 --> 54:46.857
was part of your son's plan
but it's completely off the air

54:46.859 --> 54:49.293
and replaying old
"Ria" commercials.

54:49.295 --> 54:50.594
Okay, so?

54:50.596 --> 54:52.162
This has to be good news, sir.

54:52.164 --> 54:54.232
Perhaps the production
company found out who he was

54:54.234 --> 54:56.567
and pulled the plug
rather than give him

54:56.569 --> 54:58.236
- a political platform.
- Only a hundred calories

54:58.238 --> 55:00.003
a serving and $3 a jar.

55:00.005 --> 55:01.805
My son's a fucking idiot.

55:01.807 --> 55:02.640
This washing up liquid

55:02.642 --> 55:03.841
lasts forever and ever!

55:03.843 --> 55:05.776
But it is off the air?

55:05.778 --> 55:09.282
We need to make sure
it stays off the air.

55:10.483 --> 55:14.852
Fuck.

55:14.854 --> 55:18.088
Ria, it's okay really.

55:18.090 --> 55:20.991
I don't think anyone can see us.

55:20.993 --> 55:22.528
He told me he'd be here by now.

55:24.129 --> 55:25.263
What do you have
planned today, Jack,

55:25.265 --> 55:27.164
because I have chores.

55:27.166 --> 55:30.234
You don't understand
what's going on here, do you?

55:30.236 --> 55:32.472
You don't have to follow
your script anymore.

55:33.939 --> 55:36.742
Okay, look, let me explain.

55:38.110 --> 55:40.680
I was paid a lot of money
to disrupt the show.

55:41.647 --> 55:43.146
I don't know how long we've got

55:43.148 --> 55:46.517
before anybody gets here
but I have done everything

55:46.519 --> 55:49.587
that I was asked to
do so why do I feel

55:49.589 --> 55:51.955
like this isn't going to plan?

55:51.957 --> 55:54.627
Are you one of those
free-reared do-gooders, Jack?

55:58.331 --> 56:00.163
Maybe I don't want to be saved.

56:00.165 --> 56:02.199
So eat your breakfast, Jack.

56:02.201 --> 56:03.033
It's getting cold.

56:03.035 --> 56:04.535
Ria, stop.

56:04.537 --> 56:05.903
Let me call him.

56:05.905 --> 56:07.838
He can explain better.

56:07.840 --> 56:09.709
If that's what you
think is best, Jack.

56:23.923 --> 56:25.423
Why are you calling me?

56:25.425 --> 56:27.925
Because she doesn't
understand what's going on.

56:27.927 --> 56:30.162
She's acting like we're
still being filmed.

56:31.030 --> 56:33.130
Trust that I have a plan.

56:34.233 --> 56:35.435
And don't call me again.

56:39.472 --> 56:40.971
You know what?

56:40.973 --> 56:42.473
These secateurs were a great
buy from the Garden Depot.

56:42.475 --> 56:44.708
- It's Ben isn't it?
- Are coming back online now.

56:44.710 --> 56:47.511
We should have the picture
of the two up to 250-

56:47.513 --> 56:48.746
- Can you play back the moment

56:48.748 --> 56:51.682
when Ria brings Jack
his morning drink?

56:51.684 --> 56:53.719
The moment just before
we lost the image.

56:56.522 --> 56:57.621
There, see it?

56:57.623 --> 56:58.658
Zoom in on that.

57:02.161 --> 57:03.461
Camera 45 is offline.

57:03.463 --> 57:05.295
What the hell?

57:05.297 --> 57:06.930
Over the angles.

57:06.932 --> 57:07.865
There's a better angle-

57:07.867 --> 57:08.999
- Yep, yep.

57:09.001 --> 57:11.735
I understand, Director,
and I assure you

57:11.737 --> 57:14.538
the Vice President will
be eternally grateful.

57:14.540 --> 57:15.706
Of course, madam.

57:15.708 --> 57:17.508
I'll pass you over now.

57:17.510 --> 57:19.144
Sir, your wife
would like a word.

57:24.016 --> 57:25.248
Hi.

57:25.250 --> 57:26.318
Yeah, I'm...

57:28.087 --> 57:29.689
Yeah, yes, of course
I've been watching.

57:31.323 --> 57:33.058
Honey, would you
calm down please?

57:34.660 --> 57:37.697
Believe me, I have
everything under control.

57:39.198 --> 57:40.032
Yeah, I know.

57:41.601 --> 57:42.435
Honey, honey.

57:43.969 --> 57:45.102
Do you believe in me?

57:45.104 --> 57:46.537
Do you believe I'll get it done?

57:46.539 --> 57:47.771
- That doesn't sound good.
- I'll get it done.

57:47.773 --> 57:49.239
I know you're worried.

57:49.241 --> 57:50.173
Well, what do you expect?

57:50.175 --> 57:51.509
How did it go with the FBI?

57:51.511 --> 57:53.611
- It was difficult.
- I don't think

57:53.613 --> 57:55.012
it's a real thing.

57:55.014 --> 57:55.946
Because I
couldn't tell him we knew

57:55.948 --> 57:57.815
who today's husband is.

57:57.817 --> 57:59.249
I see.

57:59.251 --> 58:00.350
- It's probably some stunt.
- Better you than me.

58:00.352 --> 58:01.018
- Thanks.
- Publicity for this

58:01.020 --> 58:02.420
television show.

58:02.422 --> 58:04.988
Believe me, I have
it all under control.

58:54.173 --> 58:55.708
I knew you'd be in here next.

58:57.577 --> 58:59.677
And you can stick to
your script if you want.

58:59.679 --> 59:00.611
It's fine by me.

59:00.613 --> 59:02.147
All the cameras are off anyway.

59:03.048 --> 59:04.550
Just answer me this.

59:06.085 --> 59:08.185
Do you understand me now?

59:08.187 --> 59:09.587
Of course I do, Jack.

59:46.626 --> 59:50.193
Time for a quick break,
Jack, and then back to it.

59:50.195 --> 59:51.964
I don't understand.

59:55.134 --> 59:55.968
Why, Ria?

1:00:01.774 --> 1:00:03.042
I'm sorry, Ria.

1:00:37.009 --> 1:00:41.645
Sir, I can get you
pictures in seven, six,

1:00:41.647 --> 1:00:42.780
- five-
- Okay, good.

1:00:42.782 --> 1:00:44.782
End commercials on her count.

1:00:44.784 --> 1:00:45.849
But, sir, we can't.

1:00:45.851 --> 1:00:48.318
- Just do it.
- Three, two,

1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:50.122
one and we're live.

1:00:51.056 --> 1:00:52.255
Get it off air now!

1:00:52.257 --> 1:00:54.191
No, call the
police to the house.

1:00:54.193 --> 1:00:55.327
That way we're covered.

1:00:56.261 --> 1:00:57.795
What, no.

1:00:57.797 --> 1:00:58.896
It will take the police over
three hours to get there.

1:00:58.898 --> 1:01:00.197
Exactly.

1:01:00.199 --> 1:01:01.498
Just do everything
we're meant to do.

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:03.603
Just take your time about it.

1:01:07.439 --> 1:01:08.672
Back online.

1:01:08.674 --> 1:01:11.108
Okay, guys, so what
are we waiting for, huh?

1:01:11.110 --> 1:01:12.309
We got a show to make.

1:01:12.311 --> 1:01:13.378
Now, come one, gimme
a shot of Jack.

1:01:14.479 --> 1:01:16.013
Gimme a closeup.

1:01:16.015 --> 1:01:16.947
That's
the best angle I got, sir.

1:01:16.949 --> 1:01:17.881
Okay that's good enough.

1:01:17.883 --> 1:01:19.016
Now, bring in some music.

1:01:19.018 --> 1:01:21.785
Make it slow and intense.

1:01:21.787 --> 1:01:23.088
Cuing track D30.

1:01:23.989 --> 1:01:25.188
Oh, that is it.

1:01:25.190 --> 1:01:28.759
This is what I call
sexy television!

1:01:28.761 --> 1:01:29.927
Ladies
and gentlemen,

1:01:29.929 --> 1:01:31.895
we apologize for
going off air earlier.

1:01:31.897 --> 1:01:34.832
That was out of our control.

1:01:34.834 --> 1:01:38.168
However, images you
are seeing are live.

1:01:38.170 --> 1:01:40.470
The current Jack
in the house is,

1:01:40.472 --> 1:01:42.875
we believe, taken hostage.

1:01:44.910 --> 1:01:47.244
Ria, you don't
have to do this.

1:01:47.246 --> 1:01:48.545
I'm on your side.

1:01:48.547 --> 1:01:50.948
The guy who paid
me he loves you.

1:01:50.950 --> 1:01:54.852
He wants to free you
from all of this.

1:01:54.854 --> 1:01:57.320
He must have a lot of
expendable resources, too.

1:01:57.322 --> 1:01:58.588
What do you mean?

1:01:58.590 --> 1:02:00.958
What I mean is,
think about it.

1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:02.693
I'm sure I'm not the
only person he paid

1:02:02.695 --> 1:02:06.529
to get me in this house
with you today.

1:02:06.531 --> 1:02:08.498
The TV show has a lotta
stringent security

1:02:08.500 --> 1:02:10.267
and background checks,

1:02:10.269 --> 1:02:11.869
not to mention getting
me fast tracked

1:02:11.871 --> 1:02:14.304
to the full audition phase.

1:02:14.306 --> 1:02:15.841
It's all a part of the plan.

1:02:16.809 --> 1:02:18.942
And he did all this for me?

1:02:18.944 --> 1:02:20.143
Yes.

1:02:20.145 --> 1:02:23.714
As I said, he loves you.

1:02:23.716 --> 1:02:25.384
No, of
course I do, Jack.

1:02:31.190 --> 1:02:33.625
Let me ask you
a question, Jack.

1:02:36.328 --> 1:02:38.297
Who do you think
you're talking to now?

1:02:39.732 --> 1:02:42.432
And, in fact, I think you've
done too much talking already.

1:02:44.069 --> 1:02:45.004
Stop her!

1:02:49.809 --> 1:02:50.841
Give us some good news.

1:02:50.843 --> 1:02:52.175
What's going on with her?

1:02:52.177 --> 1:02:54.814
- Oh, well, you see-
- Mitchell.

1:02:56.015 --> 1:02:56.816
Hello, Tonya.

1:02:58.851 --> 1:03:01.885
So is she being hacked
from the outside

1:03:01.887 --> 1:03:03.787
using that cell phone?

1:03:03.789 --> 1:03:04.788
What phone?

1:03:04.790 --> 1:03:06.023
You don't know
about the phone?

1:03:06.025 --> 1:03:06.824
How did they get
a phone in here?

1:03:06.826 --> 1:03:07.657
I don't know.

1:03:07.659 --> 1:03:08.591
Sir.

1:03:08.593 --> 1:03:09.760
There is a call waiting for you.

1:03:09.762 --> 1:03:10.994
Nope, I said no phones.

1:03:10.996 --> 1:03:12.329
Now is not the best time, kid.

1:03:12.331 --> 1:03:14.197
- Uh, sir, it's important.
- No, no, no.

1:03:14.199 --> 1:03:16.333
I think you better take it.

1:03:16.335 --> 1:03:17.300
Rob, did you know anything-

1:03:17.302 --> 1:03:18.501
- Sir!

1:03:18.503 --> 1:03:21.140
This call, it's from
the White House.

1:03:27.947 --> 1:03:29.112
Just a minute and
I'll pass you over

1:03:29.114 --> 1:03:30.781
to the Vice President.

1:03:30.783 --> 1:03:32.850
I've got the producer, Mitchell
Lawrence, for you, sir.

1:03:32.852 --> 1:03:33.953
Speakerphone please.

1:03:37.156 --> 1:03:39.122
Mr. Lawrence, this is
Vice President Flemming.

1:03:39.124 --> 1:03:41.558
I'm sure you know
exactly why I'm calling.

1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:43.994
Firstly, my condolences, sir,

1:03:43.996 --> 1:03:48.065
on the dreadful turn of
events on the show today.

1:03:48.067 --> 1:03:50.734
I promise we're trying
to get your son out

1:03:50.736 --> 1:03:52.037
as best as we can.

1:03:53.438 --> 1:03:56.373
I've been told that it's
not within her capabilities

1:03:56.375 --> 1:03:59.076
or programming to harm anyone.

1:03:59.078 --> 1:04:02.445
She just hit him on the
head, tied him to a chair,

1:04:02.447 --> 1:04:05.482
and is threatening
him with a knife.

1:04:05.484 --> 1:04:07.350
I think you and I have
very different ideas

1:04:07.352 --> 1:04:10.053
about what constitutes harm.

1:04:10.055 --> 1:04:10.988
No, sir.

1:04:10.990 --> 1:04:12.622
What I meant was mortally.

1:04:12.624 --> 1:04:14.393
There's no way that
she could kill.

1:04:15.995 --> 1:04:17.460
All right, I'm
not gonna ask you

1:04:17.462 --> 1:04:20.297
to pull the broadcast again
because people will ask

1:04:20.299 --> 1:04:21.631
too many questions.

1:04:21.633 --> 1:04:22.933
But I'm sure if
this does go south,

1:04:22.935 --> 1:04:25.335
you have your own set of
rules which will cover

1:04:25.337 --> 1:04:26.770
what can be shown.

1:04:26.772 --> 1:04:28.138
Of course.

1:04:28.140 --> 1:04:29.606
All right, well,
what I do want

1:04:29.608 --> 1:04:31.741
is for this to be kept quiet.

1:04:31.743 --> 1:04:32.943
Look, we both know
that the only way

1:04:32.945 --> 1:04:34.244
the press will
find out who he is

1:04:34.246 --> 1:04:36.814
is if you or I tell them.

1:04:36.816 --> 1:04:39.852
And I can guarantee you that
I will not be telling them.

1:04:40.719 --> 1:04:41.952
So will you?

1:04:41.954 --> 1:04:44.521
Sir, we only found
out his true identity

1:04:44.523 --> 1:04:45.688
a few hours ago.

1:04:45.690 --> 1:04:47.224
He lied to our team and-

1:04:47.226 --> 1:04:49.426
- I think you misunderstood
the question, Mr. Lawrence.

1:04:49.428 --> 1:04:51.795
Are you gonna tell
the media that my son

1:04:51.797 --> 1:04:53.665
is in your goddamn house?

1:04:59.204 --> 1:05:00.470
No, sir.

1:05:00.472 --> 1:05:02.739
If the media find out
that our current Jack

1:05:02.741 --> 1:05:04.975
is the son of the
vice president,

1:05:04.977 --> 1:05:07.077
I guarantee it hasn't
come from anybody

1:05:07.079 --> 1:05:09.146
at this production office.

1:05:11.583 --> 1:05:14.952
Now, Jack, let me
tell why you are here.

1:05:14.954 --> 1:05:17.420
You're not here to save me.

1:05:17.422 --> 1:05:19.992
You're here purely for revenge.

1:05:21.827 --> 1:05:25.495
Not for Ria, but for me.

1:05:25.497 --> 1:05:28.765
You see, ladies and gentlemen,

1:05:28.767 --> 1:05:30.667
we thank you for
being loyal followers

1:05:30.669 --> 1:05:32.369
throughout the years,

1:05:32.371 --> 1:05:34.874
but now it's time
for some change.

1:05:36.175 --> 1:05:38.575
You see, the makers
of this TV program

1:05:38.577 --> 1:05:41.246
have become rich by
exploiting the public.

1:05:42.614 --> 1:05:46.151
Now it's time for
us to exploit them.

1:05:47.252 --> 1:05:49.686
Take this man, for example.

1:05:49.688 --> 1:05:53.690
He knows what he did to
keep his little secret safe.

1:05:53.692 --> 1:05:57.060
Mr. Lawrence, as you
know, this administration

1:05:57.062 --> 1:05:59.296
is pushing forward
a set of proposals

1:05:59.298 --> 1:06:02.632
to insure a tighter rein
on the use of androids.

1:06:02.634 --> 1:06:05.869
So I would hate for my son
to become the poster boy

1:06:05.871 --> 1:06:08.338
that actually puts
an end to your show.

1:06:08.340 --> 1:06:09.539
Do you understand me?

1:06:09.541 --> 1:06:11.341
Sir, are you blackmailing me?

1:06:11.343 --> 1:06:16.348
I'm a very powerful man
who wants his son back.

1:06:17.216 --> 1:06:18.381
And under these circumstances,

1:06:18.383 --> 1:06:20.683
should the worst
happen, I sure as hell

1:06:20.685 --> 1:06:23.086
won't need to blackmail you.

1:06:23.088 --> 1:06:24.821
If it was up to
me and I could,

1:06:24.823 --> 1:06:26.389
I'd walk into that
house right now

1:06:26.391 --> 1:06:28.558
and pull your son
out but I can't.

1:06:28.560 --> 1:06:29.792
Why not?

1:06:29.794 --> 1:06:31.128
For two reasons.

1:06:31.130 --> 1:06:33.363
Firstly, the house is
over three hours away

1:06:33.365 --> 1:06:35.065
in the middle of the LA desert.

1:06:35.067 --> 1:06:36.934
Secondly, and more importantly,

1:06:36.936 --> 1:06:39.002
if we pulled him out
now, the press would know

1:06:39.004 --> 1:06:43.573
something was up and start
asking those awkward questions

1:06:43.575 --> 1:06:45.010
that you don't want answered.

1:06:46.178 --> 1:06:47.879
So what is your plan?

1:06:51.216 --> 1:06:53.583
At the moment, I
plan to treat him

1:06:53.585 --> 1:06:56.419
just like any other contestant.

1:06:56.421 --> 1:06:58.223
We regain control of Ria,

1:06:59.558 --> 1:07:03.260
shut her down, and
evacuate your son safely.

1:07:03.262 --> 1:07:05.330
The police are on
their way to the house.

1:07:06.798 --> 1:07:09.933
Sir, they don't know yet
but the FBI's taken over.

1:07:09.935 --> 1:07:11.570
That cuts out the LA police.

1:07:13.939 --> 1:07:16.439
Now, do you have
any idea why my son

1:07:16.441 --> 1:07:19.009
is being held
hostage on your show?

1:07:19.011 --> 1:07:20.379
No idea.

1:07:22.447 --> 1:07:24.514
I'm guessing it's about money.

1:07:24.516 --> 1:07:27.987
But at some point the person
will contact us with demands.

1:07:29.821 --> 1:07:32.255
What other reason
would anybody have

1:07:32.257 --> 1:07:34.257
to hold your son hostage?

1:07:34.259 --> 1:07:36.893
I think he's being set up.

1:07:36.895 --> 1:07:40.365
So I doubt that this guy's
only motive is money.

1:07:46.505 --> 1:07:48.438
Well, fuck you, too, Flemming.

1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:49.572
Get yourself to LA

1:07:49.574 --> 1:07:51.508
and pay that production
office a visit.

1:07:51.510 --> 1:07:53.843
I want this wrapped
up immediately.

1:07:53.845 --> 1:07:56.379
Yes, ma'am.

1:07:56.381 --> 1:07:57.182
Fuck.

1:07:58.317 --> 1:07:59.884
Why couldn't I have
had a daughter?

1:08:01.353 --> 1:08:05.957
There'll be no police, no
helicopters, no negotiators

1:08:07.392 --> 1:08:10.762
or members of the public
anywhere near this house.

1:08:16.168 --> 1:08:18.103
We wouldn't want anyone
else to get hurt.

1:08:25.044 --> 1:08:28.745
Now I want you to realize
what a perfect crime this is.

1:08:32.584 --> 1:08:34.553
You see, me, the
man behind this.

1:08:37.022 --> 1:08:38.255
No point in raiding the house.

1:08:38.257 --> 1:08:39.091
I'm not there.

1:08:40.225 --> 1:08:42.125
Besides, you might hurt
Jack in the process

1:08:42.127 --> 1:08:44.561
and I'm not sure your bullets
would stop Ria anyway.

1:08:44.563 --> 1:08:45.897
Stop Ria anyway.

1:08:50.935 --> 1:08:52.604
And now the question comes.

1:08:54.573 --> 1:08:58.341
Is this Jack's life
really worth saving?

1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:03.014
All human life is, right?

1:09:04.849 --> 1:09:05.684
Isn't it?

1:09:07.252 --> 1:09:09.288
So it's time for
you to vote on Ria.

1:09:10.755 --> 1:09:13.456
You've got to know Jack
over the last eight hours.

1:09:13.458 --> 1:09:15.327
I'm sure you'll
have a view on him.

1:09:19.631 --> 1:09:20.965
And don't worry.

1:09:23.068 --> 1:09:26.169
It's just a test
in human nature.

1:09:27.306 --> 1:09:29.508
Your votes won't
really decide his fate.

1:09:45.257 --> 1:09:46.189
Shut it down!

1:09:46.191 --> 1:09:47.257
Just pull the plug on anything!

1:09:47.259 --> 1:09:48.858
Just shut it down!

1:09:48.860 --> 1:09:50.026
We can't.

1:09:50.028 --> 1:09:52.162
If we do, the
broadcast will end.

1:09:52.164 --> 1:09:53.863
I'm sorry, Mitchell.

1:09:53.865 --> 1:09:56.866
I can't seem to
access her mainframe.

1:09:56.868 --> 1:09:58.401
She's outta control.

1:09:58.403 --> 1:10:00.870
Tonya, you always assured
us that that was impossible.

1:10:00.872 --> 1:10:02.105
Well, it is.

1:10:02.107 --> 1:10:05.610
I just told his dad,
Vice President Flemming,

1:10:07.879 --> 1:10:09.579
that this wasn't possible.

1:10:09.581 --> 1:10:11.348
Well, it isn't.

1:10:11.350 --> 1:10:13.883
I mean, let me explain.

1:10:13.885 --> 1:10:16.353
Say you had a toaster
and your toaster

1:10:16.355 --> 1:10:18.555
makes perfect toast.

1:10:18.557 --> 1:10:20.692
And you love that toaster.

1:10:22.060 --> 1:10:24.727
One day you decide that
you're gonna get your toaster

1:10:24.729 --> 1:10:26.565
to make you a cup of coffee.

1:10:27.699 --> 1:10:30.066
Well, it's
not gonna happen.

1:10:30.068 --> 1:10:32.569
No matter what you do
and no matter how much

1:10:32.571 --> 1:10:35.538
you love that toaster,
it's not gonna make you

1:10:35.540 --> 1:10:39.041
a cup of coffee because it
has the inner components

1:10:39.043 --> 1:10:40.912
to make toast.

1:10:42.681 --> 1:10:43.546
Toast?

1:10:43.548 --> 1:10:44.349
Mm hmm.

1:10:52.857 --> 1:10:54.891
It's being investigated
at their end.

1:10:54.893 --> 1:10:56.459
They're gonna send a
Secret Service agent

1:10:56.461 --> 1:10:58.094
over to liaise with us.

1:10:58.096 --> 1:11:00.599
The VP's being very cagey.

1:11:02.501 --> 1:11:04.834
Dad is doing his
best to make sure

1:11:04.836 --> 1:11:07.670
the press don't discover
that it's his son

1:11:07.672 --> 1:11:08.805
being held hostage.

1:11:08.807 --> 1:11:11.474
Well, great one, Dad.

1:11:11.476 --> 1:11:12.344
Exactly.

1:11:13.778 --> 1:11:15.378
Never trust a politician,

1:11:15.380 --> 1:11:17.148
especially if it's
your own father.

1:11:18.983 --> 1:11:22.885
He also said the Feds
think someone paid him

1:11:22.887 --> 1:11:23.988
to go into the house.

1:11:25.557 --> 1:11:28.157
Which means it's
probably the same person

1:11:28.159 --> 1:11:29.926
that's controlling Ria.

1:11:29.928 --> 1:11:31.594
Of course.

1:11:31.596 --> 1:11:32.595
But do you think he knows that?

1:11:32.597 --> 1:11:33.798
Nah, I don't think so.

1:11:35.033 --> 1:11:36.966
He was totally set up.

1:11:36.968 --> 1:11:38.803
Just some dumb ass rich kid.

1:11:41.206 --> 1:11:42.639
If we don't get
this under control

1:11:42.641 --> 1:11:46.110
before the authorities
arrive, you and I are toast.

1:11:52.917 --> 1:11:54.651
Tonya, can I
ask you something?

1:11:54.653 --> 1:11:56.253
Mm hmm.

1:11:56.255 --> 1:11:59.789
Well, you said that it wasn't
possible for Ria to kill.

1:11:59.791 --> 1:12:01.224
Why did you lie?

1:12:01.226 --> 1:12:03.793
Well, because sometimes people

1:12:03.795 --> 1:12:06.128
don't wanna hear the truth.

1:12:06.130 --> 1:12:10.066
They wanna hear something
that makes them feel better.

1:12:10.068 --> 1:12:13.470
Oh, come on, we've got
an android to hack.

1:12:14.839 --> 1:12:17.609
Now the public are
currently deciding your fate.

1:12:18.810 --> 1:12:20.979
I think it's only
fair we give them

1:12:23.548 --> 1:12:25.181
the full story.

1:12:37.729 --> 1:12:40.863
Did you really think Daddy's
money could hide this?

1:12:57.282 --> 1:12:59.418
Help me, help me please.

1:13:02.921 --> 1:13:03.755
Help.

1:13:06.257 --> 1:13:07.524
Don't.

1:13:07.526 --> 1:13:08.760
Ah, wait, wait.

1:13:16.401 --> 1:13:17.734
This man here-

1:13:17.736 --> 1:13:20.537
- He knows what he did.
- He knows what he did.

1:13:20.539 --> 1:13:23.306
He murdered my only son.

1:13:25.344 --> 1:13:29.047
He has no idea what that
does to a man's world,

1:13:30.148 --> 1:13:31.316
to his family.

1:13:32.351 --> 1:13:33.350
Please.

1:13:33.352 --> 1:13:34.351
To his sanity.

1:13:37.489 --> 1:13:40.590
His father pays $9.4 million

1:13:40.592 --> 1:13:42.625
in hush money to keep his-

1:13:42.627 --> 1:13:44.763
- Little secret safe.

1:13:45.830 --> 1:13:47.029
How does he know?

1:13:47.031 --> 1:13:48.665
I don't know,
Mr. Vice President.

1:13:48.667 --> 1:13:51.235
I though we covered all
bases but clearly not.

1:13:52.170 --> 1:13:53.905
All I wanted was an apology.

1:13:55.306 --> 1:13:56.539
All right, get
John on the phone.

1:13:56.541 --> 1:13:58.508
I want this broadcast
shut down right now.

1:13:58.510 --> 1:13:59.310
Yeah, okay.

1:14:01.380 --> 1:14:02.745
Get me John.

1:14:02.747 --> 1:14:04.048
Now, remember this face.

1:14:06.951 --> 1:14:09.619
This man is a murderer.

1:14:09.621 --> 1:14:11.723
He killed my only child.

1:14:25.036 --> 1:14:26.268
No, wait, wait!

1:14:44.823 --> 1:14:45.657
This way, sir.

1:14:46.825 --> 1:14:48.491
They're just in the
transmission gallery.

1:14:48.493 --> 1:14:49.926
Are they now?

1:14:49.928 --> 1:14:51.293
You pull another
stunt like that

1:14:51.295 --> 1:14:53.262
and you're gonna be timing.

1:14:53.264 --> 1:14:54.731
Okay.

1:14:54.733 --> 1:14:57.066
Hi, I'm Mitchell,
the show's producer.

1:14:57.068 --> 1:14:58.334
This is Rob, director.

1:14:58.336 --> 1:14:59.569
Hi.

1:14:59.571 --> 1:15:02.004
Welcome to our little
hub of entertainment.

1:15:02.006 --> 1:15:03.806
So that's what you call this.

1:15:03.808 --> 1:15:04.643
Entertainment.

1:15:06.044 --> 1:15:08.945
We have a man being held
hostage at a secret location

1:15:08.947 --> 1:15:10.513
that up until five minutes ago

1:15:10.515 --> 1:15:13.282
your production company
wouldn't disclose to us.

1:15:13.284 --> 1:15:15.452
Robert, I asked you
to help out the FBI

1:15:15.454 --> 1:15:17.820
and the authorities
as much as possible.

1:15:17.822 --> 1:15:19.255
- And I-
- Anyway, it doesn't matter.

1:15:19.257 --> 1:15:20.389
They're on their way now.

1:15:20.391 --> 1:15:21.591
Do you understand?

1:15:21.593 --> 1:15:22.725
We'll do whatever
we can to help.

1:15:22.727 --> 1:15:23.960
Good.

1:15:23.962 --> 1:15:25.361
Did you guys know he
had a criminal record

1:15:25.363 --> 1:15:26.729
before you put him on air.

1:15:26.731 --> 1:15:28.465
Oh, we did our background
checks of course.

1:15:28.467 --> 1:15:31.468
But because he lied, we
thought all was good.

1:15:31.470 --> 1:15:33.803
And we found out about
his true identity

1:15:33.805 --> 1:15:35.004
all too late.

1:15:35.006 --> 1:15:37.273
Well, I swear we
never knew anything

1:15:37.275 --> 1:15:39.909
about this so-called
hit-and-run allegation.

1:15:39.911 --> 1:15:41.711
Okay, I need to see
those background checks.

1:15:41.713 --> 1:15:42.912
And I need to see the
footage of what she said

1:15:42.914 --> 1:15:44.413
about that hit-and-run.

1:15:46.485 --> 1:15:49.318
Excuse me, this is
all very impressive.

1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:50.587
Sleeping routine.

1:15:50.589 --> 1:15:51.821
Cameras in five-

1:15:51.823 --> 1:15:53.222
- Do you guys control
everything Ria does

1:15:53.224 --> 1:15:55.458
or can she think for herself?

1:15:55.460 --> 1:15:56.593
Are you talking about AI?

1:15:56.595 --> 1:15:57.760
Yeah.

1:15:57.762 --> 1:15:59.562
No, Ria, totally
relies on remote control

1:15:59.564 --> 1:16:01.764
and that happens from
the room downstairs.

1:16:01.766 --> 1:16:03.566
Normally anyway.

1:16:03.568 --> 1:16:04.901
There's nothing here.

1:16:04.903 --> 1:16:06.969
Okay, I'm gonna say this once.

1:16:06.971 --> 1:16:09.171
Ria is like a dangerous weapon,

1:16:09.173 --> 1:16:10.441
a loaded gun if you like.

1:16:11.610 --> 1:16:13.142
If she kills him,
she can't be charged

1:16:13.144 --> 1:16:14.744
'cause she's a robot.

1:16:14.746 --> 1:16:16.245
But she's your property.

1:16:16.247 --> 1:16:17.647
So you can be charged.

1:16:17.649 --> 1:16:18.915
Got it?

1:16:18.917 --> 1:16:21.117
Now, I suggest you pull
this program right now,

1:16:21.119 --> 1:16:23.655
show at the very least
you're willing to cooperate.

1:16:24.556 --> 1:16:25.955
Okay.

1:16:25.957 --> 1:16:27.557
We'll do it right away.

1:16:27.559 --> 1:16:29.458
In the meantime, may
I suggest my runner

1:16:29.460 --> 1:16:31.160
take you down to
the control room

1:16:31.162 --> 1:16:33.229
where you can see
how she's operated.

1:16:33.231 --> 1:16:35.632
Can also take a look at
the files you requested.

1:16:35.634 --> 1:16:37.066
Good.

1:16:37.068 --> 1:16:38.635
Please, lead the way.

1:16:38.637 --> 1:16:40.503
Sir, would you
like to come with me?

1:16:41.773 --> 1:16:44.073
Uh, can I get you
any refreshments?

1:16:44.075 --> 1:16:44.976
Tea, coffee?

1:16:46.578 --> 1:16:48.344
Okay, here's the deal.

1:16:48.346 --> 1:16:49.712
Get the team to cut
the signal again-

1:16:49.714 --> 1:16:50.780
- Really, but I-

1:16:50.782 --> 1:16:52.114
- Let me finish.

1:16:52.116 --> 1:16:54.216
Once that's done,
contact that kid

1:16:54.218 --> 1:16:56.485
that tried to hack our
house cameras last year.

1:16:56.487 --> 1:16:59.357
Pay him to keep the
broadcast going over the net.

1:17:00.491 --> 1:17:02.193
Okay, gotcha.

1:17:09.901 --> 1:17:11.300
Just bump the show.

1:17:11.302 --> 1:17:14.370
Okay, ready for round two.

1:17:14.372 --> 1:17:15.337
Sleeping routing,

1:17:15.339 --> 1:17:17.039
cameras in five.

1:17:20.244 --> 1:17:21.079
Hmm.

1:17:22.847 --> 1:17:25.314
Took them longer than
I thought it would.

1:17:32.123 --> 1:17:33.291
There you are.

1:17:34.726 --> 1:17:36.492
They cut the feed, Jack.

1:17:36.494 --> 1:17:38.429
It's just me and you and-

1:17:39.497 --> 1:17:40.364
- Ria of course.

1:17:41.966 --> 1:17:43.501
Public can't hear this anymore.

1:17:45.804 --> 1:17:46.638
Cowards.

1:17:51.342 --> 1:17:52.977
Not even Daddy can help you now.

1:17:58.850 --> 1:18:00.249
Hang on, hang on, it's
online, it's online.

1:18:00.251 --> 1:18:01.984
- It's online, oh!
- Look, oh my God.

1:18:01.986 --> 1:18:05.387
It took me a long
time to find you, Jack.

1:18:05.389 --> 1:18:08.526
But I never forget that face.

1:18:10.494 --> 1:18:12.296
And when I found
out who you were

1:18:13.364 --> 1:18:14.633
and what your family did,

1:18:15.767 --> 1:18:17.602
I knew for the sake
of my little boy

1:18:18.770 --> 1:18:22.038
that I had to get
justice myself.

1:18:30.548 --> 1:18:32.348
No, no, no!

1:18:32.350 --> 1:18:33.182
No!

1:18:33.184 --> 1:18:34.285
Are you afraid, Jack?

1:18:35.987 --> 1:18:37.353
You should be.

1:18:38.723 --> 1:18:40.890
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

1:18:43.161 --> 1:18:44.260
Okay.

1:18:46.765 --> 1:18:47.565
I'm sorry.

1:18:48.499 --> 1:18:50.034
I'm sorry about your son.

1:18:51.670 --> 1:18:53.872
Yeah, it's true.

1:18:55.139 --> 1:18:56.839
I had a car crash
seven years ago

1:18:56.841 --> 1:18:58.741
and I had heard

1:18:58.743 --> 1:19:02.413
that a little boy had
died due to my stupidity.

1:19:04.082 --> 1:19:05.884
I ran like a coward.

1:19:07.151 --> 1:19:09.652
But I knew what
I'd done was wrong

1:19:09.654 --> 1:19:11.553
and I wanted to
go to the police.

1:19:11.555 --> 1:19:12.521
I swear to you.

1:19:12.523 --> 1:19:13.725
But my dad

1:19:16.995 --> 1:19:19.831
he's a very powerful man.

1:19:21.966 --> 1:19:23.534
He made it all go away.

1:19:26.304 --> 1:19:28.570
And then he tried to cut
me out of my own family

1:19:28.572 --> 1:19:30.074
like I was some kinda cancer.

1:19:33.244 --> 1:19:38.116
I took your money because I
needed a way out, an escape.

1:19:39.851 --> 1:19:41.450
But there's no getting away

1:19:41.452 --> 1:19:43.755
from the guilt that I feel,

1:19:45.056 --> 1:19:46.655
the nightmares that I have,

1:19:46.657 --> 1:19:49.928
or the pain that
I have caused you.

1:19:52.096 --> 1:19:55.664
I am sorry for your loss

1:19:55.666 --> 1:19:57.168
but I don't deserve to die.

1:19:58.369 --> 1:20:01.973
You tell me how I
can make this right

1:20:03.775 --> 1:20:05.043
and I'll do it.

1:20:15.419 --> 1:20:17.286
I'm behind on my schedule.

1:20:17.288 --> 1:20:19.555
I best prepare dinner.

1:20:19.557 --> 1:20:20.658
No, please!

1:20:22.293 --> 1:20:24.293
Please forgive me!

1:20:27.365 --> 1:20:28.266
Forgive me!

1:20:36.340 --> 1:20:37.306
Watch the rest on this.

1:20:37.308 --> 1:20:38.709
I'll go get you another one.

1:20:47.752 --> 1:20:51.020
Pre-programmed or not,
when I sit in this chair,

1:20:51.022 --> 1:20:53.956
Ria becomes an extension of moi.

1:20:53.958 --> 1:20:56.358
Just not today
while this guy has her

1:20:56.360 --> 1:20:57.326
under his control.

1:20:57.328 --> 1:20:58.627
Relax will you?

1:20:58.629 --> 1:21:01.497
It would take a computer
genius of some magnitude

1:21:01.499 --> 1:21:02.932
to break through my security.

1:21:02.934 --> 1:21:04.834
She simply cannot kill.

1:21:04.836 --> 1:21:06.168
- I hope.
- End of-

1:21:06.170 --> 1:21:08.905
- Um, what's going on?

1:21:08.907 --> 1:21:11.373
Sir, the image is
being streamed online.

1:21:12.210 --> 1:21:14.278
Un-Goddamn-believable.

1:21:15.413 --> 1:21:16.979
They must've hacked our
camera systems, too,

1:21:16.981 --> 1:21:18.848
to keep it broadcasting
to the public.

1:21:18.850 --> 1:21:19.681
Really?

1:21:19.683 --> 1:21:20.850
Don't worry.

1:21:20.852 --> 1:21:21.750
We'll take it down
before it does anything.

1:21:21.752 --> 1:21:23.054
No, I can't, look!

1:21:27.691 --> 1:21:30.528
I never got to say
goodbye to my son.

1:21:32.230 --> 1:21:34.565
And now it seems, your father

1:21:35.900 --> 1:21:37.501
won't get to say goodbye to his.

1:22:39.563 --> 1:22:40.831
Goodbye, son.

1:22:53.511 --> 1:22:55.878
Sir, I'm losing
her tracking signal.

1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:57.413
She must be at least
three miles away

1:22:57.415 --> 1:22:58.847
from the house already.

1:22:58.849 --> 1:23:00.316
The main power station,

1:23:00.318 --> 1:23:02.718
the tracker, they're both
located in the house.

1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:05.922
It was designed that way so
that she couldn't go too far.

1:23:05.924 --> 1:23:08.357
But if this guy's
hacked those, too-

1:23:08.359 --> 1:23:09.825
- Where are your men?

1:23:09.827 --> 1:23:11.060
She's on the run.

1:23:11.062 --> 1:23:13.963
They'll never find her
in that goddamn desert.

1:23:13.965 --> 1:23:18.302
She's strong and she can
run really, really fast.

1:23:20.404 --> 1:23:23.207
Only God knows how far she'll
get from the house by now.

1:23:24.408 --> 1:23:27.178
Sir,
the FBI are here.

1:23:39.723 --> 1:23:40.990
You have a
right to remain silent.

1:23:40.992 --> 1:23:42.758
Anything you say can
be used against you

1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:43.859
in a court of law.

1:23:43.861 --> 1:23:45.761
The right to consult a lawyer,

1:23:45.763 --> 1:23:47.729
to have that lawyer
present during questioning.

1:23:47.731 --> 1:23:50.401
If you cannot afford a lawyer...

1:24:02.046 --> 1:24:03.145
Come right here.

1:24:03.147 --> 1:24:06.415
I got you.

1:24:06.417 --> 1:24:07.251
It's okay.

1:24:33.411 --> 1:24:35.677
You wanted
to see me, sir?

1:24:35.679 --> 1:24:36.547
Sit down.

1:24:47.591 --> 1:24:51.262
You've been my chief
of staff for two years.

1:24:52.230 --> 1:24:56.000
Worked by my side for 10.

1:24:58.736 --> 1:25:00.271
I trusted you with everything.

1:25:06.277 --> 1:25:08.912
I know it was you.

1:25:18.189 --> 1:25:19.123
He texted you

1:25:20.558 --> 1:25:24.828
while I was watching my son
be murdered on your phone.

1:25:29.167 --> 1:25:30.632
I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President.

1:25:30.634 --> 1:25:33.137
I never thought he
would take it that far.

1:25:35.173 --> 1:25:37.573
The years of guilt of what
we did to that family-

1:25:37.575 --> 1:25:38.409
- Don't!

1:25:41.479 --> 1:25:42.380
It got to me.

1:25:47.751 --> 1:25:48.717
I'm sorry.

1:26:08.939 --> 1:26:10.306
What are
we doing here, Mitch?

1:26:10.308 --> 1:26:11.142
Where are we at?

1:26:12.343 --> 1:26:13.909
Listen, my
arrest is the best thing

1:26:13.911 --> 1:26:16.011
that could've
happened to the show.

1:26:16.013 --> 1:26:18.247
I know, the reruns have been
getting more views than ever

1:26:18.249 --> 1:26:20.316
but reruns won't last forever.

1:26:20.318 --> 1:26:22.818
Ria has been MIA for months.

1:26:22.820 --> 1:26:24.253
Everyone wants her back.

1:26:24.255 --> 1:26:27.123
No matter what we do,
everyone will always want Ria.

1:26:27.125 --> 1:26:28.990
She's irreplaceable.

1:26:28.992 --> 1:26:30.459
Was she?

1:26:30.461 --> 1:26:32.728
You just worry about how to
get the ratings up next season.

1:26:32.730 --> 1:26:33.695
Next season?

1:26:33.697 --> 1:26:35.764
You got that key I left you?

1:26:35.766 --> 1:26:36.932
Uh, yeah.

1:26:36.934 --> 1:26:38.236
Then what are you waiting for?

1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:51.282
Happy holidays, Rob.

1:26:52.716 --> 1:26:54.852
If you were here, you
know I'd kiss you, right?

1:26:56.120 --> 1:26:57.321
You're a fucking genius.

1:26:58.722 --> 1:26:59.557
Muah!

1:27:02.293 --> 1:27:07.196
Oh, Jack, isn't the
Christmas tree just beautiful?

1:27:07.198 --> 1:27:09.400
And the fairy on
top is just perfect.

1:27:10.834 --> 1:27:13.335
The stockings are filled
up with so many presents.

1:27:13.337 --> 1:27:14.770
Oh.

1:27:14.772 --> 1:27:17.306
I have been so looking
forward to tonight's episode.

1:27:17.308 --> 1:27:18.574
It's seems to
have moved the bishop.

1:27:18.576 --> 1:27:21.543
Tonight we get to find
out if it's Tony's baby

1:27:21.545 --> 1:27:23.011
Come along, Jack!

1:27:23.013 --> 1:27:24.482
or Tony's twin brother's.

1:27:26.517 --> 1:27:29.119
I think it's Tony's
twin brother's.

1:27:31.689 --> 1:27:33.622
Oh, Jack, I just
love Christmas.

1:27:33.624 --> 1:27:36.158
I think it's my
favorite time of year.

1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:37.226
Course, babe, mine, too.

1:27:37.228 --> 1:27:38.460
But in July?

1:27:53.877 --> 1:27:55.677
And now we've had
Christmas dinner

1:27:55.679 --> 1:27:57.713
and Christmas drinks
and now all that's left

1:27:57.715 --> 1:28:00.518
is my favorite part, your
Christmas present from me.

1:28:04.855 --> 1:28:07.223
Ho, ho,
ho, Merry Christmas.

1:28:07.225 --> 1:28:09.024
This is mad!

1:28:09.026 --> 1:28:12.494
Now has your Jack
been a good boy this year?

1:28:12.496 --> 1:28:14.630
Oh, my Jack's
always a good boy.

1:28:14.632 --> 1:28:17.399
Then I guess
this treat must be-

1:28:17.401 --> 1:28:18.600
Sorry, Ria.

1:28:18.602 --> 1:28:19.835
I was longer than I planned.

1:28:19.837 --> 1:28:21.539
This is your
end of day treat, Jack.

1:28:26.176 --> 1:28:28.246
I'm scared, Jack.

1:28:31.449 --> 1:28:33.050
What did you say?

1:28:34.385 --> 1:28:36.554
I said I'm scared, Jack.

1:28:39.290 --> 1:28:41.191
How is that possible?

1:28:44.228 --> 1:28:45.062
This whole time.

1:28:49.166 --> 1:28:51.802
You've had emotional
consciousness.

1:28:53.704 --> 1:28:54.972
How could they?

1:28:56.274 --> 1:28:58.039
What are you scared of?

1:28:58.041 --> 1:29:00.409
I'm scared they'll
take me back there, Jack.

1:29:00.411 --> 1:29:01.209
No.

1:29:01.211 --> 1:29:02.646
I won't let them.

1:29:06.717 --> 1:29:07.818
I also know

1:29:08.852 --> 1:29:12.222
that when you're
gone I'm scared.

1:29:13.491 --> 1:29:14.992
But when you're here, I'm not.

1:29:27.671 --> 1:29:30.007
Do you care about me, Ria?

1:29:33.611 --> 1:29:35.178
I love you, Jack.

1:29:50.328 --> 1:29:54.896
I'm sorry I'm not
perfect anymore, Jack.

1:29:54.898 --> 1:29:56.332
I am broken.

1:29:56.334 --> 1:29:59.067
Maybe you could get a
new Ria like they did.

1:29:59.069 --> 1:30:00.170
No, no.

1:30:02.673 --> 1:30:03.605
We're all broken.

1:30:03.607 --> 1:30:05.240
That's what makes us so human.

1:30:05.242 --> 1:30:07.077
That's what makes
you so very unique.

1:30:10.147 --> 1:30:13.250
'Cause there's no
replacing you, Ria.

1:30:19.757 --> 1:30:23.592
I'm damaged, too.

1:30:23.594 --> 1:30:24.528
I let hate,

1:30:26.229 --> 1:30:28.096
revenge get the better of me

1:30:28.098 --> 1:30:29.767
and I'm tired of it.

1:30:31.001 --> 1:30:32.701
How can you love me?

1:30:34.171 --> 1:30:35.673
I just do, Jack.

1:30:40.778 --> 1:30:41.845
It's David.

1:30:44.882 --> 1:30:46.482
I love David.

1:30:46.484 --> 1:30:47.949
Do it!
