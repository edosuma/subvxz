00:54.287 --> 00:56.812
- You promise?
- I promise.

01:02.829 --> 01:04.660
Yeah, three dead bodies.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.427
At least two suspects
fleeing the scene.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.367
It was Eli who called it in.
He heard gunshots.

01:10.437 --> 01:12.166
Mmm.

01:12.238 --> 01:15.435
Yeah, his farm's right next door
to that old warehouse.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.999
Yeah.
We got to the scene right away.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.945
No no, she hasn't talked yet.

01:41.734 --> 01:43.361
Your name is...

01:43.436 --> 01:45.802
"Maja Latin..."

01:45.872 --> 01:50.002
- "La..."
- Maya Letinskaya.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.812
- Here are the files.
- Thank you.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.586
Why are you in America?

02:00.653 --> 02:02.382
I came for Nina.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.650
What do you do for a living?

02:04.724 --> 02:06.988
I am a swan.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.996
I'm gonna take this call

02:11.064 --> 02:14.522
and when I get back, I don't wanna hear
any shit about birds, you got it?

02:14.601 --> 02:17.035
Excuse me.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.268
Yeah.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.173
He wants to come over here?

02:24.244 --> 02:26.041
I am a swan.

02:26.112 --> 02:28.546
In an hour?
Well, that's fast.

02:28.615 --> 02:31.106
I was a swan.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.360
Ah, we're screwed!

03:18.431 --> 03:19.625
Totally late.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.462
Sasha, isn't there anything you can do?

03:21.534 --> 03:23.297
It's hopeless, boss.

03:23.369 --> 03:27.135
You know they say Russia is a country
of drunks, fools and bad roads.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.767
Your country is a land
of opportunity, Sasha.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.776
Anything is possible here.

03:38.851 --> 03:41.411
She is so elegant and beautiful.

03:41.487 --> 03:44.285
She is only there because
of her rich husband.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.085
Maya was always the best dancer.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.027
Long before she met Mr. Mason.

04:14.687 --> 04:16.177
Hello, who's this?

04:16.255 --> 04:19.521
It would be such a shame
if you were late

04:19.591 --> 04:23.187
on the night your pretty wife
becomes a swan.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.390
Who is this?
How'd you get this number?

04:25.465 --> 04:29.162
I am only taking back
what you stole from Russia.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.669
I stole nothing.

04:31.738 --> 04:34.707
You have raped
our natural resources,

04:34.774 --> 04:36.901
sucking our oil fields dry,

04:36.976 --> 04:41.208
and taking the very best of our women
for your own wife, blyad.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.249
I've got nothing to say to you.

04:43.316 --> 04:46.479
If you want to find
what's at the end of this line,

04:46.552 --> 04:49.282
follow the missing money.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.084
What missing money?

04:59.198 --> 05:01.393
Do you want me
to get rid of him, boss?

05:01.467 --> 05:03.901
He fought for your country, Sasha.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.234
It's not his fault it took more
than he had to give.

05:16.949 --> 05:19.509
Mommy, Mommy!
Look out behind you!

05:29.295 --> 05:30.557
See you later.

06:08.601 --> 06:09.727
Yes?

06:09.802 --> 06:12.202
Mr. Mason, it's Usov.

06:12.271 --> 06:14.239
Usov, I'm headed into the theater.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.901
Um, I just got a call from our partners

06:16.976 --> 06:19.968
and they haven't received
any payment yet from our oil refinery.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.378
Well, the bank credit
was granted two weeks ago.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.678
I know.
The contract has penalty clauses

06:24.751 --> 06:28.312
and if we don't pay it now, we could
lose tens of millions of dollars.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.618
Okay, I hear you.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.157
- Good evening, Mr. Mason.
- Hi.

06:35.995 --> 06:37.929
- Nina.
- Hi.

06:37.997 --> 06:40.295
- Shh. You're late.
- I know, I know.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.803
I got stuck in traffic.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.473
Look at your mom.
She's gorgeous.

06:57.316 --> 06:58.977
That's fast, huh?

07:03.956 --> 07:06.447
Nina, Nina, it is time.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.721
Good luck.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.199
- Enjoy. Okay.
- I'll talk to you soon.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.402
Hello, ladies.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.514
I'll see you inside.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.675
- Roman! Hey.
- How are you, sir?

08:04.750 --> 08:06.377
Excuse me.
Did you enjoy the show?

08:06.452 --> 08:07.851
Maya was amazing, as always.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.720
Well, I'll tell you,
it was a wonderful introduction.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.315
To the greatest thing
you've ever done.

08:13.392 --> 08:15.690
Except for make you rich, right?

08:15.761 --> 08:18.924
Michael, let me talk to you for a
second.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.829
Somebody's buying up our debts.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.891
- What? Who?
- I don't know yet.

08:22.969 --> 08:24.903
But they're using front companies.

08:24.971 --> 08:26.836
Those bonds are secured
against our shares,

08:26.906 --> 08:29.204
and if we don't pay on time
we could lose a lot of money.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.985
Bravo!

08:48.494 --> 08:50.086
By the way, uh,

08:50.162 --> 08:53.495
have you heard anything
from our oil refinery?

08:53.566 --> 08:54.931
No.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.595
Well, they...
they received the bank credit,

08:57.670 --> 08:59.331
but they're delaying payment.

08:59.405 --> 09:02.238
- What?
- Yeah.

09:02.308 --> 09:04.469
All right, I'll go up there tomorrow.
I'll take care of it.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.239
I'll handle it myself.

09:07.413 --> 09:09.506
- You sure?
- Yeah.

09:09.582 --> 09:12.779
- Now you are our swan.
- Thank you.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.753
- Yes, oh!
- Daddy, Daddy!

09:15.821 --> 09:17.413
- Sweetie!
- Daddy, Daddy!

09:17.490 --> 09:19.958
Oh God, you're gorgeous.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.392
Isn't your mommy amazing?
Gorgeous!

09:22.461 --> 09:23.655
Gorgeous gorgeous!

09:26.365 --> 09:28.697
Ah, now here's a man,

09:28.768 --> 09:30.895
you definitely must meet.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.632
A good friend of mine,
Richard Valentine.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.537
Richard is very busy

09:35.608 --> 09:38.771
turning Moscow into a giant casino.

09:38.844 --> 09:40.573
I love you.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.341
Richard, please behave yourself.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.976
- I'm reinventing Russia in Sin City...
- Excuse me.

09:46.052 --> 09:49.215
...in an empty lot
between Paris, Venice,

09:49.288 --> 09:52.121
New York and the Pyramids.

09:52.191 --> 09:54.819
And I'm gonna kidnap you
and I'm gonna make you a star.

09:54.894 --> 09:57.488
You'd still be a swan

09:57.563 --> 10:01.659
in a mystical lake
over there in the neon sands.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.463
Come and dance
in America, Maya.

10:03.536 --> 10:06.505
Why would I need your fake
when I have this theater for real?

10:06.572 --> 10:09.541
All right. Who's this?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.668
- There you are!
- Oh honey.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.974
Oh God.
You were spectacular.

10:14.046 --> 10:15.980
- Thank you.
- I see our show as

10:16.048 --> 10:17.709
Tchaikovsky meets "Pretty Woman."

10:17.783 --> 10:20.752
Listen, we're going to have
Zhivago-style snow storms.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.846
A... uh... it's kind of...
she's a pole-dancing waif

10:23.923 --> 10:25.652
in a swan suit that she discards

10:25.725 --> 10:29.252
feather by feather until
he comes along... the man she loves.

10:29.328 --> 10:33.196
- Sounds kinda tired to me.
- Oh, I get it. Wait a minute.

10:33.265 --> 10:36.894
How much for your trophy wife, pal?

10:36.969 --> 10:39.733
- One, two, three...
- Oh ho ho.

10:41.941 --> 10:44.774
One, two, three, four...

10:44.844 --> 10:47.039
- What are we talking about?
- She's not for sale.

10:47.113 --> 10:49.104
Come on.

10:49.181 --> 10:52.150
Everyone's for sale.
We're just negotiating a price here.

10:52.218 --> 10:54.152
How much?

10:59.625 --> 11:02.287
Hey, Dick! Ha ha ha!
How are you, man?

11:02.361 --> 11:03.885
- Hey hey hey!
- It's good to see you!

11:03.963 --> 11:06.022
- Mikey!
- You still wearing that $10,000 watch,

11:06.098 --> 11:07.929
- you Cartier commie?
- Oh yeah!

11:08.000 --> 11:10.730
Still plundering the wild wild East, eh?
You casino capitalist.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.600
Say hello to my daughter, huh?

11:12.672 --> 11:16.199
Hello! An innocent...
from your loins?

11:16.275 --> 11:17.867
Wow.

11:17.943 --> 11:21.037
This... show...

11:24.650 --> 11:25.844
business.

11:25.918 --> 11:28.910
- Huh? Pretty good, huh?
- Pretty good, huh?

11:28.988 --> 11:31.149
Wait, whoop, what's that?

11:31.223 --> 11:34.624
Look at that.
Don't spend it all in one place now.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.889
You know that Richard
is a strange guy.

11:43.135 --> 11:44.830
Yeah, he is a little strange.

11:44.904 --> 11:49.671
But we grew up together,
used to chase the same girls,

11:49.742 --> 11:51.073
all that nonsense.

11:52.678 --> 11:56.114
He called me, wanted me
to take a stake in his new casino,

11:56.182 --> 11:59.117
but I kinda feel
like one Russia is plenty.

11:59.185 --> 12:04.054
But for all his antics,
Richard is someone we can trust.

12:04.123 --> 12:08.822
Should anything ever happen
to me, I want you to know that.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.486
Okay?

12:23.242 --> 12:25.642
Darling, I've gotta go
to the oil refinery tomorrow.

12:25.711 --> 12:27.770
Something is not right.

12:28.814 --> 12:32.272
If you have any problems,
just call Roman as usual, okay?

12:32.351 --> 12:34.546
I'm sorry.

12:41.961 --> 12:45.795
Oh, I just had a fantastic idea.

12:45.865 --> 12:49.824
Why don't we go for a little boat ride,
just the two of us?

12:49.902 --> 12:53.235
I mean, White Nights
only come once a year, yeah?

12:53.305 --> 12:56.069
Sasha will be more than happy
to take our little angel home.

12:57.376 --> 12:58.843
Won't you, Sasha?

13:15.628 --> 13:18.153
Step to the little boat.

13:18.230 --> 13:21.199
It's nice.
We'll take a nice little trip.

13:21.267 --> 13:22.325
Thank you.

13:22.401 --> 13:25.268
Okay.
Thank you, man.

14:25.931 --> 14:28.092
Are you okay?

14:28.167 --> 14:30.328
Yeah yeah.
Everything is...

14:31.403 --> 14:33.963
it's perfect.
Don't worry.

14:34.039 --> 14:37.531
But of course I worry.
You seem distracted.

14:42.081 --> 14:45.448
Sometimes I feel scared

14:45.517 --> 14:47.451
that I've been too lucky

14:47.519 --> 14:50.955
and all this happiness
is just a dream.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.686
Don't imagine things.

14:57.129 --> 15:00.098
I'll keep you safe.

15:00.165 --> 15:03.191
Now, then,

15:03.269 --> 15:05.237
always and forever.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.114
That's a pretty picture of you.

15:21.186 --> 15:23.984
Where did you get that?

15:24.056 --> 15:26.456
I may be a small-town sheriff,

15:26.525 --> 15:29.050
but I know how to use the Internet.

15:29.128 --> 15:32.655
We've been contacted
by the Russian State Department.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.995
We're expecting
an agent within the hour.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.331
Does that worry you?

15:41.407 --> 15:43.602
Because if deportation worries you,

15:43.676 --> 15:46.236
you have about an hour
to convince me

15:46.312 --> 15:49.213
- not to hand you over.
- I'm cooperating.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.912
You said your husband
was in the oil-refinery industry.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.817
He must have been away
a lot on business.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.322
All the time.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.425
But I have my darling Nina.
She's everything to me.

16:01.493 --> 16:04.724
Why do we bake cookies?
You never eat them anyways.

16:04.797 --> 16:09.131
I bake them for Daddy.
And for you.

16:09.201 --> 16:12.568
- Don't you like cookies?
- No, I love cookies.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.196
But...

16:14.273 --> 16:16.571
but if I eat as many as you do,

16:16.642 --> 16:19.543
I won't be allowed
to dance in the theater.

16:19.611 --> 16:23.570
What else do you have to do
to be a dancer?

16:23.649 --> 16:26.948
You have to practice
every day, eat little,

16:27.019 --> 16:28.953
and work a lot.

16:29.021 --> 16:33.617
Why did you pick ballet
if you can't eat cookies?

16:33.692 --> 16:36.092
Oh, because I had to.

16:43.969 --> 16:45.698
When I was eight,

16:46.805 --> 16:48.602
my mom got very sick

16:48.674 --> 16:52.007
and she couldn't take care of me.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.045
That's why I went
to a ballet academy.

16:56.148 --> 17:00.244
I remember she said,
"If you dance really well,

17:00.319 --> 17:02.753
the academy will take care of you."

17:02.821 --> 17:04.652
And I promised I would.

17:22.141 --> 17:24.575
Our teachers were strict.

17:24.643 --> 17:27.203
But I had to take it for my mom's sake.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.514
Mamochka?

17:33.018 --> 17:35.179
When she died,

17:35.254 --> 17:37.745
I had no one left but ballet...

17:39.091 --> 17:41.059
and my promise.

17:43.328 --> 17:45.262
Mamochka?

17:45.330 --> 17:46.854
Mama!

17:49.668 --> 17:52.159
So I jumped like a grasshopper

17:52.237 --> 17:54.637
and walked on my tippy toes

17:54.706 --> 17:57.903
and watched everyone else
eat their cookies.

18:54.733 --> 18:55.995
You remember

18:56.068 --> 18:58.400
what this oil refinery
was like when I bought it?

18:58.470 --> 19:00.995
Like a tomb.
And now look.

19:01.073 --> 19:04.474
So tell me, why don't you want
to modernize the plant now?

19:04.543 --> 19:06.568
Of course I do.

19:06.645 --> 19:10.513
Then why do you imagine that
the Americans will give you technology

19:10.582 --> 19:15.076
- when you haven't paid them?
- What? Not pay?

19:15.154 --> 19:18.089
I think maybe

19:18.157 --> 19:19.886
you do not understand.

19:19.958 --> 19:24.691
The bank credit was not granted
to the refinery itself.

19:24.763 --> 19:28.699
We only offered our assets

19:28.767 --> 19:30.701
as security.

19:30.769 --> 19:33.135
Half a billion dollars
is a lot of money.

19:33.205 --> 19:35.469
It doesn't just vanish
into thin air.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.771
The bank credit was received

19:37.843 --> 19:40.869
by an offshore company.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.971
What?

19:43.048 --> 19:46.484
Please call your own office.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.487
They handle all the contracts.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.723
Hi.
What are you doing here?

19:56.795 --> 20:01.129
I thought I'd wait for you,
like the old days.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.468
How are you, beautiful?

20:16.582 --> 20:19.813
How did two Americans end up
in the Russian oil business?

20:19.885 --> 20:22.251
When the Soviet Union collapsed,

20:22.321 --> 20:25.256
all the rules went out the window.

20:25.324 --> 20:28.623
If you had a little bit of money
and you were daring,

20:28.694 --> 20:30.753
you could make millions
really quickly.

20:30.829 --> 20:33.195
And Michael took a chance
at the right time.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.130
But it's dangerous too.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.328
Russian mafia is everywhere.

20:48.947 --> 20:52.144
- Hello?
- Mr. Mason?

20:52.217 --> 20:53.775
It's me, Usov.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.786
We're... we don't have
a great signal here.

20:55.854 --> 20:58.322
- I can't hear you.
- It's Usov.

20:58.390 --> 21:01.484
Why aren't you calling me
from your usual company number?

21:01.560 --> 21:03.152
I'm worried about my safety.

21:03.228 --> 21:07.426
Some money has suddenly
appeared in the bank account

21:07.499 --> 21:09.330
of one of your offshore companies.

21:09.401 --> 21:12.700
A lot of money.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.136
So you suspect someone is

21:14.206 --> 21:16.265
siphoning off money
from our main business.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.775
The company's controlled
by bearer shares.

21:18.844 --> 21:22.507
Whoever holds
the company's shares has the money.

21:22.581 --> 21:24.014
Per your instructions,

21:24.082 --> 21:28.212
I've instituted confidential
emergency protocol Nikita.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.414
There's still time
to access these shares.

21:30.489 --> 21:33.356
- Whoever did this...
- Usov?

21:33.425 --> 21:34.858
Usov?!

21:40.899 --> 21:43.265
Protocol Nikita.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.602
Mr. Mason,
what can we do for you?

21:48.674 --> 21:50.642
Hello, I'd like to order some flowers...

21:52.311 --> 21:54.404
for my wife.

22:14.866 --> 22:17.334
Miss Maya Letinskaya?

23:06.518 --> 23:08.213
Going up?

23:08.286 --> 23:09.776
Top floor.

23:15.527 --> 23:17.324
- Hello, it's Usov.
- Hello, it's Usov.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.364
- Hello?
- Hello?

24:08.380 --> 24:11.008
Mommy, Mommy!

24:11.082 --> 24:13.073
- Hey.
- Mommy!

24:14.386 --> 24:16.251
How come you're not sleeping?

24:16.321 --> 24:18.380
I had a nightmare about daddy.

24:55.527 --> 24:56.721
Come on.

25:20.218 --> 25:22.311
Hello? Usov?

25:22.387 --> 25:25.015
Usov is lying in a pool
of his own blood.

25:25.090 --> 25:27.149
Don't worry, Michael.

25:27.225 --> 25:29.785
You will soon be joining him.

25:40.605 --> 25:45.099
I will make sure you leave
Maya and little Nina penniless.

25:55.787 --> 25:58.517
- Do you hear that sound, Michael?
- What's going on?

25:58.590 --> 26:00.888
I asked you before to find
the end of the line.

26:02.160 --> 26:05.254
It is the end of the line, Michael.

26:05.330 --> 26:08.322
Sasha, get us out of here.

26:10.802 --> 26:12.463
Sasha?!

26:16.408 --> 26:17.773
What the hell are you doing?!

26:20.512 --> 26:22.537
Don't kill him!

26:22.614 --> 26:25.708
Your concern for your men is touching.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.599
But you should rather
worry about yourself,

26:29.654 --> 26:32.316
sitting inside a bomb on wheels.

26:34.326 --> 26:39.127
Listen.
Listen to me.

26:39.197 --> 26:41.131
Oh, Jesus Christ.

26:41.199 --> 26:43.793
Listen, let's... let's meet.
Let's talk, all right?

26:43.868 --> 26:46.428
Let's... let's talk about this!

26:46.504 --> 26:48.768
I have a wife.
I have a family.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.637
You don't need to do this.

26:50.709 --> 26:53.974
I want your last thought
to be of Nina growing up an orphan

26:54.045 --> 26:58.880
while your pretty wife is
stabbed to death in prison.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.248
Bye-bye, Mikhail.

27:01.319 --> 27:03.310
Hello?

28:20.699 --> 28:22.462
I'm so sorry.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.560
What's wrong, Maya?
Is everything okay?

28:25.637 --> 28:28.071
I don't know, I just...
this stupid dream last night.

28:28.139 --> 28:30.437
- Get 'em out of here now.
- Let's just do it again.

28:30.508 --> 28:31.975
- Okay, yeah.
- Excuse me, people.

28:32.043 --> 28:35.535
Can everybody leave, please?

28:35.613 --> 28:36.807
Now.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.750
Maya.

28:52.430 --> 28:55.297
I'm sorry to tell you this, Maya.

28:55.366 --> 28:56.993
Michael is dead.

29:27.966 --> 29:31.834
A generous friend,
a selfless humanitarian,

29:31.903 --> 29:35.669
a devoted father
and a beloved husband...

29:39.310 --> 29:42.802
In sure and certain hope
of resurrection into eternal life

29:42.881 --> 29:45.076
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

29:45.150 --> 29:49.917
we commend to Almighty Lord God
our brother Michael Mason.

29:49.988 --> 29:52.923
And the Lord said unto Adam,

29:52.991 --> 29:55.858
"In the sweat of thy face
shall thou eat thy bread,"

29:55.927 --> 29:58.088
till thou return unto the ground;

29:58.163 --> 30:00.495
for out of it thou was taken:

30:00.565 --> 30:04.228
for dust thou art,
and unto dust shall thou return."

30:15.280 --> 30:18.807
Maya, I'll find out who did this.

30:18.883 --> 30:20.817
Please do.

30:20.885 --> 30:22.614
I promise.

31:00.992 --> 31:03.222
Usov is dead.

31:03.294 --> 31:05.660
- Murdered.
- What?

31:05.730 --> 31:07.698
Yeah, they found
his body this morning.

31:07.765 --> 31:09.357
What's going on?

31:09.434 --> 31:12.995
There's some money missing.
A lot of money.

31:13.071 --> 31:15.562
Did Michael ever mention
anything to you

31:15.640 --> 31:17.164
about documents
or anything like that?

31:17.242 --> 31:18.436
No, Michael never
brought business home.

31:18.509 --> 31:20.500
Hmm.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.348
Maya, let me see if I can
explain this to you.

31:24.415 --> 31:27.282
They're the bearer shares
of an offshore account

31:27.352 --> 31:30.287
controlled by a blind trust,
and they're missing.

31:30.355 --> 31:34.189
Those shares are like cash.

31:34.259 --> 31:36.784
A half a billion dollars in cash.

31:39.797 --> 31:42.823
I've lost control of the oil refinery.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.142
The banks...

31:53.211 --> 31:54.769
have frozen all your assets.

31:58.883 --> 32:03.343
You could lose this home.
You could lose everything.

32:05.723 --> 32:08.317
I have no idea,
but I'll look everywhere.

32:08.393 --> 32:10.827
Okay.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.597
Let me know.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.894
Mamochka?

32:53.972 --> 32:58.102
Nina, please, let's not
stop speaking English.

33:01.946 --> 33:05.040
What will happen to me
if you leave like Daddy?

33:10.154 --> 33:13.248
Nina, I will never leave you.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.359
You promise?

33:17.428 --> 33:19.726
Of course I promise.

33:25.236 --> 33:29.036
Let's go to the theater, hmm?

34:19.090 --> 34:21.786
Hello, Nina.
Maya, can you give me a lift?

34:21.859 --> 34:23.485
My mama is sick.

34:23.561 --> 34:27.395
Yeah, I'll take you.
Do you want to come?

34:27.465 --> 34:29.797
Can I go and play?

34:29.867 --> 34:32.335
Yes, but don't disturb anybody.

34:32.402 --> 34:34.337
And don't go outside
the theater, okay?

34:34.405 --> 34:35.838
Okay.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.473
What a nice dress.

35:54.185 --> 35:55.584
Did I do something wrong?

35:55.653 --> 35:58.019
That's for you to confess
and us to find out.

35:59.056 --> 36:00.580
You have the wrong person.

36:01.626 --> 36:03.617
You are Maya Letinskaya.

36:08.266 --> 36:11.258
You can call your
husband's friends later.

36:11.335 --> 36:14.168
I'm seizing your phone
as evidence.

36:15.606 --> 36:17.233
Cocaine.

36:17.308 --> 36:18.707
How original.

36:18.776 --> 36:21.210
I don't know how it got there.

36:21.279 --> 36:22.405
Get in our car.

36:23.447 --> 36:25.915
I can't go.
My daughter is at the theater.

36:25.983 --> 36:29.111
How convenient.
That's where we're going.

37:17.668 --> 37:19.260
Are you lost?

37:19.337 --> 37:20.998
That's right, I'm lost,

37:21.072 --> 37:22.596
and I have lost something too.

37:22.673 --> 37:24.504
Will you help me find it?

37:24.575 --> 37:27.169
- What is it?
- Some papers

37:27.245 --> 37:30.976
that are worth a lot
of money, just like you.

37:32.550 --> 37:34.415
Hey!

37:36.621 --> 37:37.815
Hey!

38:16.594 --> 38:18.755
So drug possession is
part of this rap sheet.

38:18.829 --> 38:22.356
I was set up. The drugs in the car
and the dressing room were planted.

38:23.934 --> 38:25.026
What's going on?

38:25.102 --> 38:27.935
- Nina!
- Mom!

38:28.005 --> 38:30.735
Richard is someone we can trust.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.742
I want you to know that.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.402
Okay?

38:34.478 --> 38:38.005
- Richard! Richard!
- Mom!

38:38.082 --> 38:39.947
- Take her to Michael's parents!
- I will.

38:40.017 --> 38:42.042
- She will be safe there.
- I'll look after her.

38:42.119 --> 38:44.349
Baby, I love you!

38:44.422 --> 38:46.542
You gave your daughter
to an almost complete stranger.

38:46.590 --> 38:49.388
Someone killed Michael
and now they got to me.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.054
I had no choice.
If Richard could take her to Las Vegas

38:52.129 --> 38:54.563
to Michael's parents,
she would be safe there.

38:54.632 --> 38:56.429
I had to take Nina out of Russia.

39:03.808 --> 39:06.003
Then what happened?

39:06.077 --> 39:07.408
Things got worse.

39:29.033 --> 39:32.025
Put your jewelry in here.

39:43.781 --> 39:45.180
One minute.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.454
- Hello?
- Roman?

39:52.523 --> 39:55.287
- Maya.
- Where is Nina? Is she okay?

39:55.359 --> 39:58.260
She's on a plane with Richard
right now to America.

39:58.329 --> 39:59.762
They took off so quickly

39:59.830 --> 40:01.661
I didn't even get a chance
to see them off.

40:01.732 --> 40:04.895
Maya, I hope you know what you're doing
trusting Nina with this guy.

40:04.969 --> 40:07.062
Maya?

40:07.138 --> 40:09.470
Roman, get me out
of this prison, please.

40:09.540 --> 40:11.633
- Maya, it's not that easy.
- But I've been set up!

40:11.709 --> 40:14.269
- I didn't do anything!
- I... I know. Just listen to me.

40:14.345 --> 40:15.642
The police are at your house right now.

40:15.713 --> 40:17.193
They claim they're looking for drugs,

40:17.248 --> 40:19.876
but I think they're looking
for those documents.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.612
But I've looked everywhere.
I don't know where they are.

40:38.335 --> 40:40.360
Maya?

43:05.783 --> 43:07.683
Too good for our food?

43:07.751 --> 43:09.548
What's your name?

43:12.022 --> 43:13.649
Maya.

43:13.724 --> 43:15.919
Welcome to our little world.

43:15.993 --> 43:17.984
Though you don't look like you like it.

43:18.062 --> 43:19.757
There is no man to protect you here.

43:19.830 --> 43:21.559
What do you do?

43:21.632 --> 43:22.599
I'm a dancer.

43:24.068 --> 43:26.628
Marsha here was a whore too.

43:30.908 --> 43:32.466
What are you in for?

43:34.144 --> 43:35.338
Cocaine.

43:35.412 --> 43:37.676
That's seven years.

43:37.748 --> 43:38.715
But I'm innocent.

43:40.317 --> 43:41.784
I'm innocent.

43:41.852 --> 43:44.150
I'm innocent too.

43:44.221 --> 43:47.054
In here we're all innocent
but proven guilty.

43:47.124 --> 43:49.991
And guilty until proven rich.

43:50.060 --> 43:52.290
The question
you should be asking is...

43:52.363 --> 43:55.264
...who benefits by setting you up.

44:28.198 --> 44:30.428
We searched
all the ballerina's assets.

44:30.501 --> 44:33.834
I'm not lifting another finger
for some imaginary reward.

44:33.904 --> 44:35.929
I need compensation now.

44:51.622 --> 44:55.058
You don't say much
but you're well funded.

46:34.091 --> 46:36.491
Get out of my house.

46:38.562 --> 46:40.427
Look for the papers.

46:53.977 --> 46:56.070
Hello, little girl.

46:58.682 --> 47:01.150
Ah! Nyet!

47:23.574 --> 47:25.371
What is it?

47:25.442 --> 47:27.433
Bad news from America.

47:30.447 --> 47:32.347
What is it?

47:32.416 --> 47:37.046
Maya, Nina has been kidnapped.

47:41.358 --> 47:42.450
I'm sorry.

47:46.129 --> 47:47.960
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- God!

47:53.937 --> 47:54.904
Hey hey hey!

47:56.473 --> 47:59.237
Please no! Not Nina!

47:59.309 --> 48:01.539
Oh God!

48:38.181 --> 48:41.776
Nina, I will never leave you.

48:43.587 --> 48:45.555
You promise?

48:49.993 --> 48:51.961
You promise?

48:52.029 --> 48:53.496
I promise.

48:55.732 --> 48:57.427
You promise?

48:57.501 --> 48:59.731
I promise.

49:01.538 --> 49:04.132
When I grow up,

49:04.207 --> 49:06.641
- I wanna be a ballerina.
- Nina...

49:06.710 --> 49:09.270
Just like you, Mommy.

49:09.346 --> 49:13.009
It's your favorite thing in the world.

49:13.083 --> 49:15.415
It's not my favorite.

49:15.485 --> 49:18.477
You are.

49:18.555 --> 49:21.683
I promise I will find you.

49:24.061 --> 49:26.427
I will get out of here somehow.

49:28.632 --> 49:31.157
Even if I have to break out
of this prison,

49:31.234 --> 49:33.202
I will find you.

49:34.771 --> 49:37.569
And I will get you back.

49:37.641 --> 49:39.131
I promise.

50:12.209 --> 50:15.076
- You promise?
- I promise.

50:23.186 --> 50:24.278
Get up!

51:17.340 --> 51:18.967
The ring.

51:20.410 --> 51:21.900
Give it to me.

52:18.101 --> 52:21.093
I ask you,
where are those papers?

54:14.651 --> 54:16.141
Search them!

54:37.641 --> 54:38.699
Contraband.

54:42.045 --> 54:43.740
You're the ballerina.

54:45.248 --> 54:47.944
You were told jewelry
is forbidden in here.

54:48.018 --> 54:49.815
Now you know why.

54:49.886 --> 54:51.854
Back to the isolation cell.

54:51.921 --> 54:54.014
She can practice her dance there.

56:01.491 --> 56:02.856
Don't be stupid.

56:02.926 --> 56:04.951
It must look like suicide.

56:19.376 --> 56:21.742
The boss is not gonna like this.

56:21.811 --> 56:23.335
I don't care.

56:23.413 --> 56:25.381
The bitch made me bleed.

56:33.022 --> 56:34.853
That's her coffin.

58:11.321 --> 58:12.879
Medic!

58:20.597 --> 58:22.565
Turn down that racket.

58:24.167 --> 58:25.862
Is it the monitor or the whore?

58:25.935 --> 58:27.368
I think it's the whore.

58:28.404 --> 58:30.235
So do something about it!

58:43.753 --> 58:46.347
Watch how you're driving!

59:09.646 --> 59:12.581
Mommy, wake up.

59:12.649 --> 59:14.412
Wake up.
Don't die, Mommy.

59:14.484 --> 59:15.781
Mommy!

59:33.803 --> 59:35.532
I love you, Mommy.

59:50.687 --> 59:53.121
You totally fell on your ass.

59:53.189 --> 59:54.679
Fell on my ass?!

59:54.757 --> 59:56.156
I was trying to remove the bra.

59:56.225 --> 59:57.658
You should have done that yourself.

59:57.727 --> 59:59.126
The boy is shy.

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:01.524
Right.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:04.761
He's never seen
a naked woman before.

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:07.803
Are you saying I'm a faggot?!

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.532
Only a homo would not
take advantage.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:13.132
Usually these whores are ugly.

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:20.345
I'll do her right now!

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:22.213
Yeah, show us your dick!

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.528
That's right,
get your dick inside here!

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:48.141
Leave some for me!

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:09.092
Did he finish?
It's my turn now!

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:13.933
Dream on.

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:39.151
- Hello?
- Roman?

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.816
Maya, is that you?

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:45.724
Maya?

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:48.457
Maya?

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:54.593
Because the police
were searching for me,

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.501
Roman took me to a safe place.

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:58.506
Roman sounds like a good friend.

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:03.134
I knew Roman before I met Michael.

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:05.203
What exactly does that mean?

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:09.081
Whatever it was,
it was a long time ago.

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:14.456
It felt like weeks passed,

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:18.153
but later I realized
it was only a few days.

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:25.067
Now when I needed him,
Roman saved my life.

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:26.658
Nina.

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:42.946
Maya.

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:44.384
Shh, it's okay.

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:47.422
We contacted Richard Valentine
in Las Vegas.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.651
He promised to help me
search for Nina.

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.488
Richard's gonna help you find Nina.

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:54.997
Then Roman went back to the city
so it didn't look so suspicious.

01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:56.827
He said the police were watching him.

01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:58.867
I'll see you in a couple days.

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:04.535
Staring down that clock
is not going to stop

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.837
the Russians from
taking custody of you.

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:12.241
So you haven't found the papers.

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:20.282
I was so sure
Michael had sent me a message.

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:22.881
I just didn't know how.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:25.928
It had to be somewhere.

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:29.431
It had to be.

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:14.632
All dancers to the stage.
All dancers to the stage.

01:05:24.153 --> 01:05:27.122
Maya, can you give me a lift?
My mama is sick.

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:31.685
Cocaine.

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:09.663
Katya, if you're gonna
be prima ballerina...

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.893
get your ass to the stage.

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:19.370
God damn rush.

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:23.111
There's no toilet paper!

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:31.915
Katya, how nice of you
to finally join us.

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:36.792
I would replace you in a second.

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:00.906
"To my lovely swan,

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:04.316
Ladozhsky train station,
St. Petersburg,

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:06.617
clock chamber 35C.

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.283
The code is Nina's birthday.

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.848
Tell no one.

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:15.523
I love you now, then,

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:18.362
always, forever."

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:03.959
Hello?

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:05.625
Maya.
Hey, it's Roman.

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:08.499
- How're you doing? Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:11.335
Good good.
I was just worried about you.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.270
Wrong place, idiots.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.245
Hey!

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:24.677
Go next door.

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:54.299
Give it to me!

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:37.243
Shit! Hello?

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:38.616
- Maya?
- Richard!

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:40.450
I have that flight for you.

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:42.888
The ticket is waiting for you
at the check-in counter.

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:47.557
I'll pick you up when you get here.

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:50.462
If you're a fugitive,
how did you get out of the country?

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:52.523
It's Russia, not the Soviet Union.

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:56.430
I flew through Latvia.

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:59.565
It took longer,
but I made it through.

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:01.575
Where are the bonds now?

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.745
All right then, let's talk about
this guy... Richard Valentine.

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:10.114
We can't get a hold of him
to corroborate your story.

01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:12.153
His office doesn't
know where he is.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:14.951
A guy like Valentine
doesn't just disappear.

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:17.821
I came to Las Vegas
so he can help me find Nina.

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:20.191
When I first met him,
I thought he was strange,

01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:22.162
but Michael said I could trust him.

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:44.742
Hi.

01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:49.283
Thank you.

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:31.219
Where are we?

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:36.922
Where are we?

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:03.916
This is Richard Valentine.
Please leave me a message.

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:06.893
And viva Las Vegas.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.451
Where is Richard?

01:16:40.195 --> 01:16:41.856
I put him down in the desert.

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:10.453
- Nina?!
- Mama!

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:32.236
Watch out.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:34.839
She can kick behind her own head.

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:58.665
Use the silencer.

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:08.206
Are we going to die now?

01:18:08.283 --> 01:18:11.616
No, sweetie.
We're not going to die.

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:13.518
Only bad guys gonna die.

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:17.982
Can you really kick behind your head?

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:51.117
I told you to use the silencer.

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:23.919
Mama!

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:27.758
You came back for me.

01:19:27.829 --> 01:19:29.524
Of course I came back for you.

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:31.998
I promised I would.

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:58.859
Well, that's quite a story
you've got there.

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:02.522
But there's one thing
you haven't told me that I have to know.

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:06.125
Where are the bonds?

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:10.171
I have them.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.775
Does that mean you're
not going to hand me over?

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:21.282
That must be
the Russian-embassy guy now.

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:38.130
This doesn't mean
that I'm going to let you go.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.497
Thank you.

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:42.196
It just means that I trust
you're not gonna run out on me.

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:45.032
Mama, Mama.

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:48.701
The man from the theater
is lost again.

01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:54.307
- Sheriff?
- Yeah.

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:57.647
- How did you know I was a fugitive?
- I didn't.

01:20:57.719 --> 01:21:00.779
The Russian Consulate contacted me.

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:03.848
Please don't tell them
about the documents.

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.051
Why?

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:06.957
Because if they're really
from the embassy,

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.859
they would not know about them.

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:10.397
You trust me, don't you?

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:19.269
Sheriff.
Ivanko, Russian State Department.

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:20.933
Jim Nash, glad to meet you.

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:22.806
I'm sorry for the inconvenience,

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:25.574
but we're gonna have to keep
Miss Letinskaya here

01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:27.638
pending our homicide investigation.

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:29.843
I understand.

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:32.352
Perhaps I could trouble you
to keep us notified

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.217
of how the case proceeds.

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:38.623
The safety and well-being
of our citizens is our primary concern.

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:40.957
Sure.

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:44.927
Did she have any documents

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.332
when you arrested her?

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:57.879
Give me the documents.

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:05.508
Your husband begged for his life.

01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:09.349
But you won't beg, will you?

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:52.599
Jesus, it took you long enough.

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:55.227
Just tell me the bitch is dead.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.677
The bitch is alive, Roman.

01:23:07.749 --> 01:23:09.774
Maya?

01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:12.342
And she's coming for you.

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:08.772
I have only a question

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:14.281
Only one question and that's why

01:24:14.349 --> 01:24:18.752
But I can't think of an answer

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:23.223
There isn't an answer
that won't make me cry

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:29.359
It has to be a lie

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:32.332
That the story ends

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.268
Without you by my side

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:42.803
Hope I gave you

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:47.177
Everything you wanted

01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:52.441
Hope I gave you

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.786
Everything you needed

01:24:56.858 --> 01:25:01.454
I'd give anything to anyone

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:05.966
Just to hold you one more day

01:25:06.034 --> 01:25:09.993
I should have loved you more

01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:14.201
Before you slipped away

01:25:26.888 --> 01:25:31.188
If I had only a reason

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:33.284
Just give me a reason

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:36.387
So I understand

01:25:36.464 --> 01:25:41.231
'Cause the silence
is louder than thunder

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:45.636
And dark as the night falls
on a lovers' dance

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:51.471
It has to be a lie

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:54.674
That this story ends

01:25:54.749 --> 01:25:58.549
Without you by my side

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:04.749
Hope I gave you

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:08.990
Everything you wanted

01:26:11.866 --> 01:26:14.733
Hope I gave you

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:19.296
Everything you needed

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:24.209
I'd give anything to anyone

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:29.012
Just to hold you one more day

01:26:29.083 --> 01:26:32.177
I should have loved you more

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:37.122
Before you slipped away

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:40.958
I know that I'll see you again

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:43.395
I don't know where

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:46.627
I don't know when

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:51.661
'Cause forever has no end

01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:05.110
Did I give you

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:07.848
Everything?

01:27:07.922 --> 01:27:10.982
Hope I gave you

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:15.962
Everything you wanted

01:27:18.299 --> 01:27:21.097
Hope I gave you

01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:25.230
Everything you needed

01:27:25.306 --> 01:27:30.243
I'd give anything to anyone

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:35.248
Just to hold you one more day

01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:38.581
I should have loved you more

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:42.316
Before you slipped away

01:27:45.126 --> 01:27:48.584
I should have loved you more

01:27:48.663 --> 01:27:52.963
Before you slipped away.
