00:05.406 --> 00:07.208
[girl] Previously on
Make It Or Break It.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.277
Carter, it's beautiful.

00:09.310 --> 00:12.446
I've invited Denver
to an invitational here,
and they have accepted.

00:12.480 --> 00:16.584
It's not like we can pick up and
move. You've already taken a big
enough pay break to come here.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.053
You do your routine
like we practiced.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.122
I can land
the full in back out.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.356
We play it safe.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.828
I promise
it'll never happen again,

00:27.861 --> 00:29.597
especially at Nationals.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.831
I know.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.566
Because you're not
going to Nationals.

00:34.102 --> 00:36.337
[rock music]

00:46.580 --> 00:49.150
- Hey.
- Hi, Emily.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.519
- You guys seen Sasha?
- Yeah. He's in his office.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.955
Wonder what kind
of mood he's in today.

00:54.988 --> 00:59.860
I'm sure he's forgotten
that your tragic dismount
cost us the Invitational.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.629
- Lauren.
- What? It did.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.864
And what about your fall?

01:03.897 --> 01:08.269
I slipped. You choked.
Big difference.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.809
I'd be embarrassed
to show my face.

01:15.843 --> 01:19.347
Sasha told her she wasn't ready
for that move and she
deliberately disobeyed him.

01:19.380 --> 01:23.117
But she's still part of
The Rock. We're supposed
to support each other.

01:23.151 --> 01:25.186
The only rock she belongs in
is the one she crawled out
from under.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.055
New necklace?

01:28.088 --> 01:30.658
Yeah, new for me.
It's an heirloom.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.627
Nice. My dad got me
one of these once.

01:33.661 --> 01:38.532
Except it had a big diamond
and it was real gold.

01:38.566 --> 01:42.170
Well, I love it.
It's from Carter.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.305
It belonged
to his mother.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.574
She told him to give it
to the girl he wanted
to be with forever.

01:49.577 --> 01:52.313
Wow! That's big.
I'm so happy for you.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.115
Your neck might not
turn green.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.621
Know what I see
when I look out there?

02:00.654 --> 02:02.890
Knowing you, dollar signs.

02:02.923 --> 02:06.294
I was going to say the next
Olympic gold medalist.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.795
Emphasis on gold.

02:07.828 --> 02:12.566
I'm serious, while you're
here, no agenting. Keep
your hands off the girls.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.736
Agreed. So long as you tell me
where I can put my hands?

02:18.206 --> 02:20.474
But you've asked
for time off, right?

02:20.508 --> 02:22.176
Remind me again.
Time off for what?

02:22.210 --> 02:25.213
Nationals. Boston.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.914
How could you forget?
It's only two weeks away.

02:26.947 --> 02:31.452
Nationals, I'm pretty sure this
is the first I'm hearing about
it. Is this a big deal?

02:31.485 --> 02:33.587
Dad, I'm serious.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.723
[laughs] I know.
You always are.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.591
Relax. It's taken care of.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.527
I wouldn't miss it
for the world. You know that.

02:39.560 --> 02:43.331
Payson? A minute?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.399
- I'll see you later.
- OK.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.437
Girls, I'd like you
to meet Ms. Martin.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.604
Call me M.J.

02:50.638 --> 02:51.872
Hi, I'm Payson.

02:51.905 --> 02:55.409
I know who you are, Payson
and you, Lauren and you,
too, Kaylie.

02:55.443 --> 02:58.579
- Sasha's told me all about...
- Um... Call me Coach Belov.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.013
[M.J.] Right.

03:00.047 --> 03:03.351
[Sasha] In addition to being
one of the top sports agents
in the country,

03:03.384 --> 03:07.621
Ms. Martin is also a consultant
for the American Gymnastic
Federation.

03:07.655 --> 03:10.624
They've asked her to come
here and shoot some... uh...

03:10.658 --> 03:12.626
- Sizzle pieces.
- Right.

03:12.660 --> 03:16.430
Up-close-and-personal packages
for the major sports networks
and the Internet

03:16.464 --> 03:18.632
featuring the girls
considered likely to make
the National Team.

03:18.666 --> 03:21.535
I've recommended
the three of you.

03:21.569 --> 03:24.505
I want you to give Ms. Martin
your full cooperation.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.275
This is good for The Rock
and could be good for you.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.643
For the next few days,
we'll follow you around,
ask a few questions.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.012
But, for the most part, we'll
try to stay out of your way.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.281
I was a ranked
tennis player myself.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.783
I know that the last thing you
need right now are distractions.

03:35.816 --> 03:40.521
Between parents and boyfriends,
I've been there. Don't tell
Coach Belov.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.356
You need to stay focused.

03:42.390 --> 03:46.394
But you also need to understand
that from this point on, you're
going to be in the spotlight.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.729
Let me tell you something,
you better get used to it.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.699
Kmetko! Excuse me.

03:53.467 --> 03:57.605
Call me if you have any
questions about the shoot
or anything.

03:57.638 --> 04:02.310
Think seriously about having
someone dedicated to looking out
for your best interests.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.713
Mind telling me
what you're doing?

04:05.746 --> 04:08.749
- Training?
- Was I not clear?

04:08.782 --> 04:11.819
- Yes. You said I wasn't
going to Nationals.
- Not the point.

04:11.852 --> 04:16.690
I came to train athletes
with the qualities required
to compete at the highest level.

04:16.724 --> 04:20.528
Based on your recent
performance, I've decided you
are not one of those athletes.

04:20.561 --> 04:23.664
There is no longer
a place for you here.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.533
Get your things
and go, now.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.468
Can't I just...

04:27.501 --> 04:28.669
Goodbye, Emily.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.749
- I don't believe it.
- He threw her out.

04:43.584 --> 04:48.322
Looks like it's gonna be
the three of us again.
One-two-three, three-two-one.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.757
Order has been restored.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.746
[rock music plays]

05:16.417 --> 05:18.619
If dough could scream, what do
you think it would sound like?

05:18.652 --> 05:19.887
Can't speak for all dough.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.422
OK. That dough?

05:21.455 --> 05:24.825
Like an egotistical ass
with an English accent.

05:24.858 --> 05:28.429
That's a relief. 'Cause I
thought it might sound like me.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.663
No. We're cool.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.799
Besides, I see you
more as a green pepper.

05:35.636 --> 05:36.770
Thought you trained
during the day.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.639
Not anymore.

05:41.575 --> 05:42.943
Maybe you should go back
to the dough.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.716
Why not?

05:48.749 --> 05:49.683
He kicked me out.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.654
I'm not at The Rock anymore.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.122
Are you serious?

05:55.155 --> 05:57.691
The English ass?
Why'd he do that?

05:57.725 --> 06:00.428
He told me not to do this
dismount and I did it anyway.

06:01.829 --> 06:02.796
And I blew it.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.365
That's it?

06:06.700 --> 06:07.635
So now what?

06:07.668 --> 06:09.803
I have to prove to him
that I belong there.

06:10.738 --> 06:11.939
How do you do that?

06:11.972 --> 06:14.808
I kick ass
on that dismount.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.176
And that means practice.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.379
Which is gonna cost money
'cause I can't get into
The Rock to train.

06:20.748 --> 06:21.849
What about at night?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.451
It's locked at night.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.885
Mm-hmm.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.890
So, this is where you work.

06:29.923 --> 06:33.527
Mmmm... pizza. I'd be as big
as a house if I worked here.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.696
What are you doing here?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.931
We heard what Sasha said.
Are you OK?

06:37.965 --> 06:40.634
Yeah, the whole gym heard.
That was so not cool.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.636
I'm fine. Thanks.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.905
So, what are you gonna do?

06:46.740 --> 06:49.477
Keep training.
Convince Sasha I belong there.

06:51.912 --> 06:55.616
I see Band Boy works here?
That's convenient.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.218
He's cute.
What's up with you two?

06:58.251 --> 07:01.555
Nothing's up. We just work
together, that's all.

07:01.589 --> 07:04.625
[Lauren] Ugh.
Do they even clean this place?

07:05.726 --> 07:06.760
Dad?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.703
I was going to tell you.

07:15.736 --> 07:19.540
When? When you lost
your job? No?

07:19.573 --> 07:23.911
How about when you started
to look for a new job? Nope,
that was a few weeks ago.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.214
- How about when you started
delivering beer?
- When I had some good news.

07:27.247 --> 07:30.951
[Kim] I can't believe you
put on a suit every day
and pretended...

07:30.984 --> 07:32.686
You shouldn't
be eavesdropping.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.688
I've never heard them
this angry before.

07:34.722 --> 07:39.727
Do you know how stupid I feel
that I didn't pick up on it?

07:39.760 --> 07:42.029
How could I not notice
something so different?

07:42.062 --> 07:44.765
When do you have time to notice
anything? You're so busy at
The Rock with your job.

07:44.798 --> 07:48.468
At least I have a job.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.741
I'm sorry, Mark.
I didn't mean to say that.

07:54.908 --> 07:58.646
Maybe it wasn't such
a good idea to come here.

07:58.679 --> 08:01.248
You know why we came here.
To help our kids achieve
their dreams.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.551
How can that ever,
ever be a mistake?

08:03.584 --> 08:05.719
[Kim] I know.

08:05.753 --> 08:08.956
I know, Mark.
Dreams are great,

08:08.989 --> 08:12.660
but we have to eat.
And I don't like what
it's doing to us.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.662
This is all your fault.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.864
[slams door]

08:19.833 --> 08:22.903
What am I gonna do?
It's gone. I can't find
my necklace anywhere!

08:22.936 --> 08:25.272
I'm sorry. What necklace
are we talking about?

08:25.305 --> 08:27.841
The one Carter gave me.
The heirloom.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.811
I could have sworn I put it
in my bag. You saw me,
didn't you?

08:30.844 --> 08:35.015
I saw you showing it off,
but no, I didn't see you
put it in your bag.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.550
I did!

08:36.584 --> 08:41.021
OK, well, I'm sure you just
dropped it. Did you check
the gym, or in your car?

08:41.054 --> 08:42.723
I've looked everywhere!

08:42.756 --> 08:44.792
What if Carter notices
I'm not wearing it?

08:44.825 --> 08:46.927
Relax. Guys don't notice
stuff like that.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.297
I'll help you look in
the morning. Don't worry.
We'll find it.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.667
All right, Lauren, thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:05.713 --> 09:06.947
[Summer] Knock, knock.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.984
Salmon, broccoli, and beets.

09:11.018 --> 09:14.855
You know, we could actually sit
and eat at a table together.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.356
That'd be great
for my acid reflux.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.760
You're not really spending
the night, are you?

09:19.793 --> 09:22.362
Yeah. Your father asked me to
stay while he's out of town.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.598
I don't need a baby-sitter.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.966
I don't need
a step-mother.

09:25.999 --> 09:30.604
And I certainly don't need
somebody creeping me out
by playing house.

09:30.638 --> 09:34.742
That's pretty.
Where'd you get it?

09:34.775 --> 09:36.644
You don't pick out
all my jewelry.

09:38.178 --> 09:42.683
Well, whoever gave it to you has
very good taste. It's beautiful.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.168
This is a bad idea.
A bad, bad idea.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.772
If by bad you mean kick-ass
brilliant, you're welcome.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.774
We could get arrested.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.008
No risk, no reward.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.711
Worst case, you're the first in
your family to do hard time.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.047
Third, actually.

10:14.081 --> 10:17.217
The more I learn about you,
Kmetko, the more I find
intriguing.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.821
Let's go.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.998
You can actually do that?
Pick a lock?

10:31.031 --> 10:34.702
Some people grow up learning
cartwheels and back flips.
This is what I learned.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.771
Your dad must
be very proud.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.740
Who do you think taught me?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.953
Stop screwing around.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.824
I love this floor.
Bounce with me.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.826
I'm here to practice.
Remember?

10:58.859 --> 11:03.096
This is wild. What's under here?
It feels like springs.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.898
Springs.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.968
Seriously?
And that's not cheating?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.770
No, it's...

11:11.071 --> 11:12.840
Would you please stop
before someone...

11:12.873 --> 11:15.108
Bounce with me.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.844
If I do that,
then will you let me practice?

11:16.877 --> 11:19.079
You can do
whatever you want.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.152
This is so stupid.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.754
I know.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.761
Whoa! So that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.867
[screams]

11:49.777 --> 11:53.747
Was that a dismount
you're working on?

11:53.781 --> 11:57.484
Look, you don't have
to stay if you don't want to.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.787
I want to.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.056
It's called a full-in-back-out.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.126
Translation?

12:06.159 --> 12:08.829
Two somersaults
with a full twist.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.098
You say that
like it's not a big deal.

12:11.131 --> 12:14.868
Well, if I'm meant to be here
it shouldn't be.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.140
[M.J.] So who has the edge?

12:20.173 --> 12:22.843
In what? Earning potential?

12:22.876 --> 12:26.914
In Nationals. I don't want to
find myself in the editing room
with no footage on the winner.

12:26.947 --> 12:27.981
Help me cover my ass.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.082
I'd love to.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.553
Unfortunately,
it's not that simple.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.555
Kaylie, for instance,
is a total winning performer,

12:35.588 --> 12:38.091
but I wonder if she's got
the fire in the belly.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.894
Lauren, on the other hand,
is all fire,

12:40.928 --> 12:43.797
but I wonder if she can
channel it to succeed
at this level.

12:43.831 --> 12:47.200
And Payson, well, there's
nothing stopping Payson.

12:47.234 --> 12:50.537
What about the girl
you tossed out? Emily?

12:50.570 --> 12:54.041
Kmetko, yeah. Maybe more
raw talent than all of them.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.143
Unfortunately, she's
done for herself so long,

12:56.176 --> 12:58.812
I wonder if she can listen
to anyone else.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.314
You're up to something,
aren't you?

13:06.887 --> 13:08.355
You're coming
to the salon with me today.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.591
I'm thinking mani-pedi,
maybe a massage.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.360
You deserve
a little pampering.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.362
I don't have time.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.831
Honey, I thought
you had buckets of time.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.432
You know what I mean.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.836
Until Sasha cools down,
this whole thing blows over.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.372
Sasha is not gonna cool off
and this whole thing
will not blow over

13:25.405 --> 13:28.175
- unless I do something.
- Oh, honey, sure it is.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.377
You know how men are:
they need to beat
on their chests,

13:30.410 --> 13:33.847
do their Tarzan yell,
and let you know they're
king of the jungle.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.983
It makes them feel better.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.886
And then later,
usually at night,

13:38.919 --> 13:41.054
they realize
that they need us...

13:42.122 --> 13:45.025
Sorry. That took
a wrong turn somewhere.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.061
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Where are you going?

13:48.095 --> 13:49.429
Out.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.334
Poor thing.
She is so upset!

13:54.367 --> 13:56.336
I wish Sasha would just
cave in already.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.209
Mom, what are you thinking?

14:03.911 --> 14:08.281
I am thinking that
every Tarzan needs a Jane.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.884
Not the red suit, Mom.
This is a really bad idea.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.988
So, what does it
look like?

14:15.022 --> 14:18.091
It's got a gold pendant
and blue stones on it.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.061
Thanks for helping me, Pay.
This is making me sick.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.899
So, uh, what's up
with your dad, huh?

14:25.933 --> 14:29.136
He, um, got laid off.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.638
And he lied to your mom?

14:31.671 --> 14:33.406
That doesn't sound like
your parents.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.909
Sounds a lot
like mine, though.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.277
Is something up?

14:39.079 --> 14:41.448
Nah. No, you know.
Just, uh, the usual.

14:43.450 --> 14:47.921
- Find it?
- No. And Carter already
noticed I wasn't wearing it.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.122
Did you tell him
you lost it?

14:49.156 --> 14:50.924
I told him I left it at home.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.693
I said I didn't want
anything to happen to it
while I was working out.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.930
Nice. Sometimes I wish
I could lie like that.

14:56.964 --> 15:00.133
I had to. If not,
the truth would kill him.

15:00.167 --> 15:04.471
Totally. It's just sad
when a relationship
has to be based off lies.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.941
I'm not judging,
I'm just saying.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.413
Oh, I was talking to M.J.
How cool is her job?

15:13.446 --> 15:16.416
She gets to jet-set
all over the world,
meets all these people:

15:16.449 --> 15:18.485
Venus Williams,
Michael Phelps.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.221
My dad told me her agency
just signed Kelly Parker.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.490
She'll make millions just
for showing up at Nationals.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.092
Really?

15:25.125 --> 15:27.260
- [gasps] Oh, I found it!
- Where is it?

15:27.294 --> 15:30.530
Oh. False alarm.
Just a bottle cap.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.706
Emily's sorry.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.408
Very sorry.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.376
And she sent you
to tell me that?

15:43.410 --> 15:46.079
Oh, no. She would die
if she knew I was here.

15:46.113 --> 15:49.516
But she's sorry.
And she'll never
do it again.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.318
[chuckles] Um...

15:51.351 --> 15:53.520
I'm afraid
it's not that simple.

15:53.553 --> 15:56.256
Well, you know,
it could be.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.492
You could just tell me
what she needs to do.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.462
She, uh, she needs to know
that I'm her coach.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.498
Oh, she does. In fact,
you give her the trots.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.336
Oh. Um,

16:09.369 --> 16:11.438
could you please not
tell her I said that.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.740
Fear isn't the same
as obedience.

16:13.773 --> 16:17.410
Well, obedience
is difficult for Emily.

16:17.444 --> 16:21.148
So maybe you just tell me
what I can do to...

16:21.181 --> 16:23.050
Mrs. Kmetko.

16:23.083 --> 16:26.053
I'm very busy right now,

16:26.086 --> 16:28.288
um, training
the other girls.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.324
But, um, for now,
with regards to Emily,

16:31.358 --> 16:33.560
I've actually said
all I wanted to say.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.495
So, um, thank you,
and, uh,

16:35.528 --> 16:37.597
good day.

16:50.610 --> 16:54.081
You know it's highly
inappropriate getting
involved with gym moms.

16:54.114 --> 16:57.284
- That's a little ironic,
coming from you, isn't it?
- How so?

16:57.317 --> 17:00.587
There are those that
consider what we enjoyed
to be "inappropriate".

17:00.620 --> 17:04.457
- Jealous?
- The sports manager
and the young gymnast.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.460
- Uh, you weren't that young.
- Innocent, naive...

17:07.494 --> 17:09.329
OK, a little young,
never naive.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.830
Your reputation was legendary.

17:10.863 --> 17:14.334
That was just bluff
and bravado to cover
my severe shyness,

17:14.367 --> 17:16.603
which you took
full advantage of.

17:16.636 --> 17:20.073
- How did you ever
get over me?
- Who says I did?

17:20.107 --> 17:23.610
- My timing sucks.
- Not necessarily.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.079
No. I'm late for
an appointment. Gotta go.

17:26.113 --> 17:29.282
And besides,
you're too old for me.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.652
Wow.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.622
[Payson] M.J.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.524
Payson. What is it?

17:37.557 --> 17:40.160
I was wondering...

17:40.193 --> 17:42.295
I want you
to be my agent.

17:42.329 --> 17:45.498
Really? You've thought
about this?

17:45.532 --> 17:47.600
You're ready to give up
your amateur status?

17:47.634 --> 17:49.602
I've worked really hard.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.405
I'm going to win Nationals
and I want to make
the most of it.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.544
For my family.
Can you help me?

17:57.577 --> 18:00.147
Actually, I've already
made a few calls.

18:01.614 --> 18:05.218
Endorsements, print work,
personal appearances...
it's all there.

18:05.252 --> 18:08.255
A colleague of mine
signed Kelly Parker.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.390
I know you're the one
who can beat her,

18:10.423 --> 18:12.525
and I know I can get you
even more money.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.365
OK. I want to do it.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.667
You can keep that,
discuss it with your parents
if you like.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.570
No. They want this
as much as I do.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.540
You made a good choice,
Payson Keeler.

18:27.574 --> 18:28.675
We have a deal.

18:38.518 --> 18:41.521
[sobbing]

18:52.465 --> 18:55.268
- Hi, Kaylie.
- [sobs] Hi.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.604
Hey, is everything OK?

18:57.637 --> 19:01.741
[sighs] Yeah.
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.614
I, uh, I lost a necklace.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.717
And it meant a lot
to me. It was a gift.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.720
I'm so sorry.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.488
Can I help you
look for it?

19:15.522 --> 19:18.325
No. I mean, I've just...

19:18.358 --> 19:20.393
I've looked everywhere
for it already.

19:20.427 --> 19:23.430
Well, at least I can
keep an eye out for it.
What does it look like?

19:24.631 --> 19:28.335
Uh, it's a gold pendant,
blue stones.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.306
Sounds beautiful.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.508
I'm sure it's going
to turn up somewhere.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.344
Thanks.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.215
[sighs]

19:42.249 --> 19:45.752
I have some good news.
They can't pay me
what they used to,

19:45.785 --> 19:48.688
- but I can get
my old job back.
- That's great!

19:48.721 --> 19:50.657
They were stupid
to let you go
in the first place.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.426
No. Not my job here.
My old job in Minnesota.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.229
Minnesota?
We're going back
to Minnesota?

19:56.263 --> 19:58.365
Wait till I tell
Jenny and Ashira.

19:58.398 --> 20:01.301
But, Dad, we can't leave.
What about Nationals
and Rock?

20:01.334 --> 20:03.370
- I need to be here.
- It's not all about you.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.505
[Mark] Take it easy.
Nobody's moving.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.374
I'm gonna be commuting.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.576
- No!
- It's a bear
of a commute...

20:09.609 --> 20:12.579
- Dad, that's not a commute.
- No. I don't want you to go.

20:12.612 --> 20:17.384
- Sweetheart...
- He's not.
No one's going anywhere.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.419
I met with M.J.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.688
She's a consultant
for American Gymnastics.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.757
- And a sports agent.
- She's going
to represent me.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.659
You should see what she
already has planned.

20:26.693 --> 20:30.530
- And a barracuda.
- Endorsements, appearances...

20:30.563 --> 20:32.665
There'll be more
than enough money
to support all of us.

20:32.699 --> 20:36.536
And if I do well
at Nationals, you won't
have to work at all.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.272
You just need to say yes.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.540
No.

20:40.573 --> 20:45.478
- No?
- No agents. No managers.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.747
- No sponsorship deals.
- But, Mom, I...

20:47.780 --> 20:51.284
Payson, you know
how we feel about this.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.320
We don't know what's gonna
happen in the future.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.289
What if we can't
pay for college
when the time comes?

20:56.323 --> 20:59.659
- You will not be eligible
for a scholarship...
- I know the future.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.694
I'm going to go to Nationals
and beat Kelly Parker.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.331
Then I'm going
to the Olympics where
I'm going to win gold

21:04.364 --> 21:05.698
and write my own ticket.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.667
M.J. believes in me!

21:07.700 --> 21:09.736
I just wish you guys
believed in me too.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.538
Payson.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.607
Wait a minute.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.746
[sighs]

21:21.614 --> 21:23.616
Hyaah! Whoa!

21:33.693 --> 21:35.328
Have you missed one
yet tonight?

21:35.362 --> 21:38.398
No. It's feeling good.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.766
It's feeling really good.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.502
I think I'm gonna
kick it up a notch,

21:42.535 --> 21:43.870
increase the difficulty
with a release move.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.339
If that won't convince
Sasha I belong here...

21:46.373 --> 21:49.576
Awesome.
What's a release move?

21:49.609 --> 21:52.612
It comes before the dismount.
I let go of the bar
and then I catch it again.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.815
- So... that's hard?
- Kinda. [chuckles]

21:55.848 --> 21:59.085
See, in between the releasing
and the catching part,

21:59.118 --> 22:01.621
I have to do a somersault
in the pike position.

22:01.654 --> 22:05.725
And to do that,
I have to flip my hands
to change the grip.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.661
It's called a Jaeger.
[chuckles]

22:10.497 --> 22:11.564
So Jaeger me.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.688
- You OK?!
- Damn it!

22:35.722 --> 22:38.891
I need more height,
but the timing on
my release is off.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.662
- I need you to help me.
- Me help you?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.731
Watch for my grip change.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.535
When my feet
are pointed at that light
I need to let go.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.603
When you see my feet
point at that light,
yell "now."

22:50.637 --> 22:53.906
"Now." I can do that.
What's the worst
that can happen?

22:53.940 --> 22:56.576
I... I break my neck.

23:10.790 --> 23:11.791
Now!

23:19.231 --> 23:21.968
Yes!
That was amazing!

23:22.001 --> 23:24.604
I've never seen
anything like that before!

23:29.609 --> 23:31.711
I've never seen anyone
like you before.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.451
So now what?

23:40.487 --> 23:41.654
More practice.

23:44.657 --> 23:47.660
[rock music playing]

23:50.763 --> 23:53.633
No, no. You're
still rushing.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.469
I said fluid, not faster.
They have completely
different meanings.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.671
Do we need to take a break
so you can get a dictionary
and look them up?

23:58.705 --> 24:01.541
- No. I get it.
- [Sasha] Then show me.
Do it again.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.521
Did he tell her
she could come back?

24:16.055 --> 24:17.957
That would be a "no."

24:17.990 --> 24:19.959
Hey, let's make sure
we get this.

25:20.687 --> 25:21.821
Wow.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.798
- I see the dog
has learned a new trick.
- I deserve a shot at Nationals.

25:31.831 --> 25:36.869
Afraid I'm out of little
biscuits. You'll have to go
without a treat. Sorry.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.738
I'm not leaving.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.742
I'm as good
as everyone else here.
You saw what I just did.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.746
- Poor delusional thing.
- Shh!

25:46.779 --> 25:48.781
You have no right
to take this away from me!

25:57.624 --> 25:59.992
[softly] You're no good
to me, Emily.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.662
You're like a dog
that won't stay.

26:02.695 --> 26:06.032
Un-coachable because
you refuse to listen.

26:06.065 --> 26:09.035
You've been the boss of you
for such a long time, Emily,

26:09.068 --> 26:11.337
but you haven't shown me
you'll let somebody else
take that job.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.740
So, please, stop
embarrassing yourself.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.975
Go home and get on
with your life.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.788
What was that all about?

26:35.194 --> 26:37.830
[door opens, closes]

26:38.831 --> 26:40.767
What are you looking at?
Get back to work!

26:40.800 --> 26:41.968
Lauren, beam!

26:43.035 --> 26:46.038
[rock music playing]

26:48.808 --> 26:52.645
* I'm looking for a sign

26:52.679 --> 26:55.882
* To show me
that I'm right on *

26:55.915 --> 26:58.084
* Cue to break the fall

26:58.117 --> 27:01.187
* When my back's
against the wall *

27:01.220 --> 27:04.423
* So I'll take it
as it comes *

27:04.456 --> 27:10.429
* I'll show up anyone who
thinks I'll take it slow *

27:10.462 --> 27:14.000
* Just watch me as I go

27:14.033 --> 27:16.669
* Yeah

27:16.703 --> 27:18.705
* Ooh, ooh

27:18.738 --> 27:20.807
* Na na na-na-na-na na

27:20.840 --> 27:23.876
* Na na-na na
na-na-na na-na *

27:23.910 --> 27:26.879
* Hey, you
You better believe *

27:26.913 --> 27:31.784
* You better believe
I'm not going away *

27:36.188 --> 27:38.825
* Hey, you
you better believe *

27:38.858 --> 27:43.730
* You better believe
I'm not fading away *

27:44.864 --> 27:47.767
* Wow!

27:47.800 --> 27:50.970
* Hey, you
you better believe *

27:53.740 --> 27:56.809
* Hey, you
you better believe *

27:59.145 --> 28:02.849
* I'll be shining
the brightest light *

28:02.882 --> 28:05.484
* I'm putting myself right

28:05.517 --> 28:08.487
* I'll be ready
when destiny comes *

28:08.520 --> 28:11.490
* The answer has finally
found me, I'm gone *

28:11.523 --> 28:14.160
* Hey, you
you better believe *

28:14.193 --> 28:18.765
* You better believe
I'm not fading away *

28:23.235 --> 28:26.205
* Hey, you
you better believe *

28:26.238 --> 28:29.742
* Hey, you
you better believe *

28:29.776 --> 28:32.078
* Hey, you
you better believe *

28:32.111 --> 28:34.881
* You better believe *

28:43.956 --> 28:45.758
Ready, Lauren?

28:45.792 --> 28:48.160
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking you home.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.496
- Your father's still...
- That's my necklace
you're wearing.

28:50.529 --> 28:53.165
Oh! Oh, I didn't think
you'd mind.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.768
You and your friends share
jewelry all the time, right?

28:55.802 --> 29:00.039
- We do not share jewelry.
- Oh. I'm pretty sure you do.

29:00.072 --> 29:03.142
You have so many nice things,
I couldn't decide.

29:03.175 --> 29:06.045
So which one do you think
is best, the rings...

29:06.078 --> 29:08.815
...or this one?

29:12.118 --> 29:14.086
Maybe I should get
a second opinion.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.355
- Is Kaylie still...?
- The rings.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.826
[Summer] Yeah,
I thought so, too.

29:19.859 --> 29:24.030
Maybe you could "loan"
that one to somebody else?

29:24.063 --> 29:28.167
Lauren, you have
to earn your place
in your friends' lives,

29:28.200 --> 29:30.937
just like you earn
your place in gymnastics.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.205
You don't just get a spot.

29:33.239 --> 29:36.809
You have to earn your place
by the little things you do
every day.

29:36.843 --> 29:39.078
Look, I know
you're mad at me,

29:39.111 --> 29:42.048
but I'm trying to earn
my place, too, in your life.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.917
And it isn't always going
to be by being your pal.

29:46.318 --> 29:48.120
I'll be waiting in the car.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.897
I wish Payson understood
that we moved here

29:57.930 --> 30:00.099
because we believe in her.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.103
Let me ask you something.

30:05.404 --> 30:08.875
Is letting Payson take
the sponsorship money,

30:08.908 --> 30:11.978
- is that the worst thing?
- No.

30:12.011 --> 30:15.948
But this is about
more than money and
college scholarships.

30:15.982 --> 30:20.152
You want Payson to take on
that burden, let her feel
responsible for the family?

30:20.186 --> 30:23.255
- No.
- [Mark] Agreed.

30:23.289 --> 30:26.959
So... the burden
is going to be on you

30:26.993 --> 30:28.194
to take care of them
on your own.

30:28.227 --> 30:32.164
No, the burden's gonna
fall on you for being
apart from them.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.434
And apart from you.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.306
- I'm so sorry
I let you down.
- Oh, honey.

30:51.918 --> 30:53.085
Thought I might find you here.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.890
You always did
love playgrounds.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.228
Good thing.

31:02.261 --> 31:05.297
"Teeter-totter day care."
Isn't that what you used
to call it?

31:05.331 --> 31:06.899
[chuckles]

31:06.933 --> 31:10.102
I never left you alone.
Really.

31:10.136 --> 31:13.906
The salon where I worked
was right across
the street. Big window.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.976
I always had an eye on you.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.012
I still do.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.252
So I went by the gym.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.455
Heard you put on
quite a little show.

31:29.488 --> 31:33.659
[scoffs] I'm so stupid.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.427
I thought I could
make him want me.

31:35.461 --> 31:38.297
You will, honey.
I know you will.

31:38.330 --> 31:39.966
Just give it some time.

31:42.301 --> 31:46.072
Do you remember that
Wonder Woman punching bag
you used to have?

31:46.105 --> 31:50.176
No matter how hard you
hit it, she just kept
popping right back up?

31:51.743 --> 31:53.412
We Kmetkos
are like that, too...

31:53.445 --> 31:55.481
- [groans]
- You know...

31:55.514 --> 31:59.218
- What? Did I say something?
- Where do you get
all of this stuff?

31:59.251 --> 32:01.153
I never had a Wonder Woman
punching bag.

32:01.187 --> 32:02.688
I don't even know
what that is.

32:02.721 --> 32:05.224
Honey, are you sure?
I could have sworn...

32:05.257 --> 32:08.094
And enough with the
"we are the mighty,
mighty Kmetko" speeches.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.062
There is nothing
mighty about us.

32:10.096 --> 32:14.000
- Speak for yourself.
- I am.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.335
I'm tired of fighting
for everything.

32:16.368 --> 32:19.305
I just...
I just want to quit.

32:19.338 --> 32:20.739
Can't you just
let me do that?

32:20.772 --> 32:23.709
Can't you just let me quit,
just this once?

32:23.742 --> 32:27.179
You're not a quitter, Emily.
You never have been.

32:27.213 --> 32:29.281
[thunder rumbles in distance]

32:31.550 --> 32:33.419
Fine.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.522
If that's what
you want to do, quit.

32:36.555 --> 32:39.291
I guess there's nothing
keeping us here.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.761
I think I'll call my friend
Tahnee Bodansky.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.496
You remember Tahnee?

32:44.530 --> 32:47.766
Reno, traffic school,
dirty blonde hair.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.768
OK, yeah. Yeah.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.738
She opened up a nail salon
in Las Vegas,

32:52.771 --> 32:55.141
asked me
to come work with her.

32:55.174 --> 32:57.476
And I said no, that we
couldn't leave Boulder.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.579
But I guess we can now.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.083
You want us to move
to Vegas?

33:04.116 --> 33:07.186
It's an option, Emily.

33:07.219 --> 33:10.156
I mean, we have to look
at all of our options, right?

33:10.189 --> 33:13.025
No, I don't think
it's a good idea,

33:13.059 --> 33:15.027
but if you want to quit...

33:15.061 --> 33:19.431
Maybe when you finish
high school, you could
come and work with me.

33:19.465 --> 33:23.035
You know? Could be fun.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.171
We'd be together
all the time.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.406
I mean, I know
it's not the Olympics,

33:27.439 --> 33:29.541
but it could be fun.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.446
Yeah.

33:35.481 --> 33:38.284
I have to go.
I'll see you at home.

33:46.325 --> 33:49.228
We are the mighty,
mighty Kmetkos, Emily.

33:49.261 --> 33:53.065
- [knocking on door]
- [thunder rumbles]

33:57.369 --> 34:02.474
I've only had one dream
my entire life... that was
to go to the Olympics.

34:02.508 --> 34:05.644
If you take that
away from me,
I don't know who I am.

34:07.246 --> 34:10.149
Just give me a chance.

34:10.182 --> 34:12.518
I'll be the best
you've ever coached.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.287
I'll do anything you say,
no questions. Please.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.524
Words are cheap, Emily.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.592
You can talk all you want,
but you haven't listened.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.628
It wasn't about whether or not
you could do the move.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.297
It was about whether you
could listen to me.

34:25.331 --> 34:27.333
And clearly you haven't.

34:28.534 --> 34:32.538
Then tell me what to do!
Coach me!

34:32.571 --> 34:35.374
Let me show you
that I can listen.

34:39.278 --> 34:40.612
Please!

34:46.618 --> 34:48.420
My keys.

34:48.454 --> 34:51.290
We're not letting
your little Dickensian friend
break us in tonight.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.296
Back handspring.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.632
Switch leap.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.470
Split three-quarter.

35:05.904 --> 35:08.540
Now fall, backwards.

35:08.574 --> 35:10.576
I didn't say look,
I said fall.

35:12.544 --> 35:15.147
Damn it, Emily,
if you can't trust me
to catch you,

35:15.181 --> 35:17.583
- how can you trust me
to coach you?
- I don't understand...

35:17.616 --> 35:20.219
I don't want questions,
I want obedience.

35:20.252 --> 35:22.654
You couldn't follow
my simple instructions
at the Invitational

35:22.688 --> 35:24.523
and you're not
following them now. Do it!

35:24.556 --> 35:26.592
- I can't!
- Why? Why not?

35:26.625 --> 35:29.295
Why can't you just surrender
right here, right now?

35:29.328 --> 35:32.698
Because I've tried that
and it doesn't work!

35:32.731 --> 35:37.503
"Just surrender"?
Do you even know what
you're asking me to do?

35:37.536 --> 35:41.507
I know what you're thinking.
That I'm too headstrong
and too in control.

35:41.540 --> 35:46.578
But do you know what my life
would be like if I wasn't
in control? Huh? Do you?

35:46.612 --> 35:49.515
I am the only person
that I can trust.

35:49.548 --> 35:52.618
Emily. Emily. Emily.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.488
It's OK.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.592
It's OK.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.295
It's OK.

36:04.596 --> 36:07.199
I'm sorry.

36:07.233 --> 36:09.568
I want to do it,
I really do.

36:09.601 --> 36:11.637
It's OK.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.942
You are an exceptional
woman, Emily.

36:16.975 --> 36:19.511
And I'm not asking you
to give up on your own power.

36:19.545 --> 36:23.549
I'm just asking you to let me
in, let me guide you.

36:23.582 --> 36:27.653
No. I've tried that.
You're just gonna leave us,
like everyone else.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.721
Like who? Like who else?

36:29.755 --> 36:32.424
My dad.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.626
Brian's dad.

36:36.662 --> 36:38.997
And Marty. And now you.

36:39.030 --> 36:42.234
[chuckles]
Unless you know
something I don't,

36:42.268 --> 36:46.705
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Is that what you told
the last team you deserted?

36:51.543 --> 36:54.380
I promise I will never
disappear again.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.647
You have my word on that.

36:57.716 --> 37:02.488
Hey, you have
an amazing talent

37:02.521 --> 37:04.423
inside of you, Emily Kmetko,

37:04.456 --> 37:07.526
but you won't be able
to find it on your own.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.628
I know that.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.598
I know that I need you.

37:12.631 --> 37:16.635
I need you more than I've ever
needed anyone in my whole life.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.837
That's a start.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.575
Be back here
5:00am tomorrow, sharp.

37:23.609 --> 37:26.578
No promises.
We'll take it from there, OK?

37:29.681 --> 37:30.849
Wait!

37:40.326 --> 37:41.593
Catch me.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.683
[door opens]

38:06.685 --> 38:08.387
I'm going now.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.769
You've known
what you've wanted to do,

38:23.802 --> 38:26.772
why you were put here,
since you were five years old.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.742
You were born to be
an Olympic champion.

38:30.776 --> 38:34.380
It is your purpose,
it is your joy.

38:36.848 --> 38:39.485
It took your old man
a little longer
than his fifth birthday

38:39.518 --> 38:41.553
to figure out what he was
meant to do with his life.

38:41.587 --> 38:44.790
But I'm as certain
of my purpose as you are.

38:44.823 --> 38:47.359
I was put here
to take care of my family,

38:47.393 --> 38:49.761
to give Mother, Becca,
and you the things you need.

38:49.795 --> 38:51.763
[sniffles]

38:51.797 --> 38:54.700
That is my calling. My joy.

38:58.604 --> 39:01.907
I believe in you.
Payson, I do.

39:01.940 --> 39:05.343
- I know you're going
all the way.
- [sighs]

39:08.614 --> 39:10.549
I'm asking you
to believe in me.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.494
I'll call you tomorrow.

39:26.598 --> 39:27.699
[door closes]

39:28.500 --> 39:29.801
Hey.

39:31.202 --> 39:34.573
- How's Payson?
- Just quiet.

39:38.944 --> 39:41.847
You take care of your sister
and your mother.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.686
I'll call you every day.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.792
[Payson] Daddy!

39:57.663 --> 39:58.830
Thank you.

39:58.864 --> 40:01.500
For what?

40:01.533 --> 40:03.735
Everything.

40:03.769 --> 40:06.772
Everything
you're doing for me.

40:06.805 --> 40:09.475
I'll make you proud, Dad.
I promise.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.210
You already have.

to never again

41:25.951 --> 41:28.720
discuss my underage
daughter's future

41:28.754 --> 41:30.255
without
her parents present.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.591
She assured me that
she had your consent.

41:32.624 --> 41:36.061
As manager of this gym,
if I see you talking
to any of those girls

41:36.094 --> 41:40.532
without their parents
there, I will have you
escorted out.

41:40.566 --> 41:41.933
Understand me?

41:42.768 --> 41:44.102
Good.

41:46.938 --> 41:48.807
[Lauren] Surprise!

41:48.840 --> 41:50.742
Oh, my God,
where was it?

41:50.776 --> 41:52.678
Under one of the mats.
You're lucky I found it.

41:52.711 --> 41:54.780
- Someone else probably
would have kept it.
- Help, please?

41:54.813 --> 41:57.716
- Sure.
- Thank you, Lo.
You're such a good friend.

41:57.749 --> 42:00.285
No. Seriously.

42:00.318 --> 42:03.088
I don't know how I'd go
through half of this stuff
in my life without you.

42:03.121 --> 42:06.057
Boyfriends are great,
but friends...

42:06.992 --> 42:08.727
I gotta show Carter!

42:16.367 --> 42:18.970
Emily...
if you have a minute,

42:19.004 --> 42:21.106
I'd love to get started
on your video profile.

42:21.139 --> 42:22.874
Get you on camera
for a few questions.

42:22.908 --> 42:25.711
I should probably
be training.

42:25.744 --> 42:28.113
The... What did you
call them again?

42:28.146 --> 42:30.015
- Video profile?
- Right.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.750
I think those are
just for the girls

42:31.783 --> 42:33.652
who are going
to Nationals.

42:33.685 --> 42:36.688
I know. And Coach Belov seems
to think you're one of them.

42:57.743 --> 43:01.012
Hey. Someone took your name
off the day schedule.

43:01.046 --> 43:03.114
Yeah. I did.

43:04.683 --> 43:06.918
I'm going to Nationals!

43:06.952 --> 43:08.086
Come on, bounce with me.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.788
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

43:12.924 --> 43:14.626
You know...

43:16.161 --> 43:18.864
- ...I couldn't have
done it without you.
- No. It's all you.

43:18.897 --> 43:20.932
Seriously, you don't...

43:21.900 --> 43:23.201
You don't need me.

43:30.676 --> 43:32.210
What are you afraid of?

43:36.081 --> 43:37.683
Nothing.

43:38.850 --> 43:39.985
You?

43:42.020 --> 43:43.755
Everything.
