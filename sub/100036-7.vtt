WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.304
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.337 --> 00:06.006
Randall, I don't look
at you and see color.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.008
Then you don't see me, Dad.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.478
JACK:
Mr. Lawrence.
Would you and your wife

00:10.511 --> 00:12.513
like to come to the house
this weekend for dinner?

00:13.714 --> 00:15.516
Mr. Pearson, I have a daughter.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.352
Six months old.
Got full custody,

00:18.386 --> 00:20.588
and my-my parents help out
with her sometimes.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.023
She is 14. She is not seeing
a boy who puts babies in people.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.958
We are in lockstep.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.996
Deja, you are telling me

00:29.029 --> 00:31.765
that you took a baseball bat
to his Mercedes?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.568
Oh, my God.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.170
I'm...
(laughs)

00:36.204 --> 00:38.106
I'm s-I'm sorry.
I-I would've given you back.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.541
-(laughs): I'm serious.
-(chuckles)

00:40.574 --> 00:42.743
I mean, I thought
they would have, too.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.180
What you doing after school?

00:46.214 --> 00:49.550
Um, I got drill practice
until 7:00.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.851
Why?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.420
Want to come with me to Max's?

00:52.453 --> 00:54.054
Who's Max?

00:54.088 --> 00:55.889
Are you for real right now?

00:55.923 --> 00:57.358
You don't know
about Max's Steaks?

00:57.391 --> 01:01.061
Oh, my God.
Y'all and these cheesesteaks.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.797
I swear,
it's only bread and meat.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.066
Deja, how have you been living
in Philly for this long

01:06.100 --> 01:07.735
and you've never
been to Max's Steaks?

01:07.768 --> 01:11.605
Well, Randall only takes us
to touristy places.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.775
So, I've been
to the Liberty Bell,

01:14.808 --> 01:16.777
I've been to the Rocky Statue

01:16.810 --> 01:20.614
and the Franklin Institute
about three times already.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.250
Come on.
That's not Philly.

01:22.283 --> 01:25.986
I mean, it's-it's Philly,
but not Philly Philly.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.090
I told you
I came here before, right?

01:30.124 --> 01:32.926
With my mom and my grandma,
when I was, like, four or five?

01:32.960 --> 01:35.095
Nah. Nah.
Where'd you go?

01:35.129 --> 01:38.366
I think we were
visiting my uncle.

01:43.171 --> 01:46.340
And all I remember was
being in the car and-and...

01:46.374 --> 01:48.108
there were these
Christmas lights,

01:48.142 --> 01:49.977
but it was warm out.
That was weird.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.813
Oh, and-and the water.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.916
The-the lights were
reflecting off the water.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.519
That's-that's about it.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.588
Dang, I hate that.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.089
Hate what?

02:02.122 --> 02:05.493
Not remembering things
from when my grandma was alive.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.798
Hey, do you have
any tests today?

02:13.234 --> 02:17.205
What if we, uh,
what if we skip school?

02:18.672 --> 02:21.709
I'm-I'm serious.
I could show you my Philly.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.378
Uh, I-I don't know.
I mean, I want to...

02:24.412 --> 02:25.813
Then go with that.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.084
(brakes screeching)

02:38.592 --> 02:40.594
You're really not getting off?

02:59.713 --> 03:02.250
*

03:02.283 --> 03:03.917
(Randall whistling)

03:03.951 --> 03:06.720
Ladies, cancel
your dinner plans.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.656
Councilman Gomez
brought tamales to work,

03:08.689 --> 03:12.226
and I may or may not have taken
a few too many.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.094
What's wrong?

03:14.127 --> 03:16.096
Principal Herbert called.

03:16.129 --> 03:19.032
Deja and Malik
skipped school today.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.034
What?

03:21.068 --> 03:22.903
You're not even supposed
to be seeing that boy.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.606
He goes to my school. You want
to ban me from school, too?

03:25.639 --> 03:27.441
-Excuse me?
-Did she just...

03:27.475 --> 03:30.210
She did.
Well, go to your room.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.381
Now.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.287
And you're grounded for...

03:39.320 --> 03:41.121
-A decade.
-A decade.

03:41.154 --> 03:44.124
I hope your day was worth it.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.159
*

03:54.902 --> 03:57.204
Philly!

03:57.237 --> 03:59.239
*

04:09.750 --> 04:11.585
You sure are getting
dressed up for this dinner.

04:11.619 --> 04:12.886
I don't think I've ever seen you

04:12.920 --> 04:14.622
wear a sports coat
on the weekend.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.625
What are you talking about?
I always wear a sports coat.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.092
Okay.

04:21.695 --> 04:22.830
What?

04:22.863 --> 04:24.832
Rebecca Pearson,
I've known you for 19 years.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.000
Your "okay"
is never just "okay."

04:27.034 --> 04:30.604
I just think it's interesting
that Kevin's asked us to invite

04:30.638 --> 04:32.072
Ms. Applebaum over
for dinner for ages

04:32.105 --> 04:33.607
and we've always said no.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.643
But then, out of the blue,
you decide

04:35.676 --> 04:37.311
to invite Randall's teacher
over for dinner?

04:37.345 --> 04:39.513
First of all, Ms. Applebaum--

04:39.547 --> 04:42.015
she's not a teacher, all right?
She is the school nurse.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.284
And the only reason Kevin
wants her over here

04:44.318 --> 04:45.686
is because he has a crush.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.421
-Mm.
-I mean, Randall talks

04:47.455 --> 04:50.424
about Mr. Lawrence constantly.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.193
-You're not the least bit
curious about him?
-Sure.

04:53.226 --> 04:56.029
But I can also wait for parent/
teacher conferences in a month.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.332
-Bec.
-Okay.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.800
Okay.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.403
Okay.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.540
Hey, babe, help me out.

05:06.574 --> 05:09.209
In the Mecca
by Gwendolyn Brooks

05:09.242 --> 05:12.045
or The Weary Blues by the one
and only Mr. Langston Hughes?

05:12.079 --> 05:14.281
You've read both of those.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.183
-Help me with this, please?
-Yeah.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.889
Mmm.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.825
You smell good.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.460
Book's not for me, though.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.496
-No?
-It's for Randall.

05:28.529 --> 05:32.065
I did a poetry series in class.
He really seemed to dig it.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.902
(laughs)
You a troublemaker, Korey.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.904
Or should I say, Korey X?

05:36.937 --> 05:38.506
Wait, what? Me?

05:38.539 --> 05:40.974
Oh, don't go acting
all innocent.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.676
Y-You're talking
about black consciousness poets

05:42.710 --> 05:44.512
an hour before
we go to have dinner

05:44.545 --> 05:46.880
with your only black student
and his white parents.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.149
(giggles)

05:49.182 --> 05:51.018
You don't have to be Sherlock
Holmes to crack this case.

05:51.051 --> 05:54.354
Look, Mr. Pearson asked me to
dinner. I didn't invite myself.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.724
You could've just said,
"Sorry, can't."

05:56.757 --> 05:58.526
"I'm taking
my incredibly sexy wife

05:58.559 --> 06:00.227
to see Sister Act
for the third time."

06:00.260 --> 06:03.196
-Trish, it's just dinner, okay?
-(laughs)

06:03.230 --> 06:05.232
Okay.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.369
So, when you talked
to Malik's mom yesterday...

06:09.403 --> 06:11.338
Uh, V-neck or crew?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.607
Uh, feels like
a V-neck kind of night.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.609
Well, what was her vibe?

06:15.643 --> 06:17.911
You get a sense of what kind
of people they are?

06:17.945 --> 06:20.380
Rastafarian vegans
who love outdoor sports.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.082
-Really?
-Nope.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.251
'Cause I just invited them
to for dinner.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.454
So we don't even know if they're
on board with our plan?

06:26.487 --> 06:28.055
What plan?

06:28.088 --> 06:30.891
Come on, Beth.
There's a boat.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.926
You and I are in the boat.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.730
The plan is to get Malik's
parents to join us in said boat.

06:36.764 --> 06:39.767
Destination:
Splitsville Dejik.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.301
It's Deja and Malik-- Dejik.

06:41.334 --> 06:42.603
Oh, please don't
give them a ship name.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.204
-Maleja.
-Listen,

06:44.237 --> 06:45.873
this is not
a recruitment dinner, okay?

06:45.906 --> 06:47.975
This is for us to get to know
Malik's parents better.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.977
Feel them out,
see if they're good people.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.945
Maybe we won't even have
to keep the kids apart.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.314
He's too mature for her
and he got her to skip school.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.383
-Deja lied to us.
-I know.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.752
But keeping the kids apart
didn't work out too well

06:58.786 --> 07:01.655
for Romeo and Juliet's
parents, so...

07:01.689 --> 07:03.757
Hey.
Look at my feet.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.425
What do you see?

07:05.459 --> 07:07.728
-A couple hundred dollars
on the Amex.
-Mm-mmm.

07:07.761 --> 07:11.231
Open toe shoes for an open mind.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.967
See, the only way we're gonna
get through this

07:14.001 --> 07:15.969
is to have an open mind.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.404
And red wine.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.272
Lots of red wine.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.709
I'm gonna go check on the food.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.816
If she just opened
a dance studio

07:28.849 --> 07:30.618
and he's working
all kinds of hours,

07:30.651 --> 07:33.487
-who's watching those kids?
-They probably have hired help.

07:33.521 --> 07:36.490
-Do they?
-(chuckles) I don't know.

07:36.524 --> 07:39.192
-They do pretty well
for themselves, though.
-Hmm.

07:39.226 --> 07:42.596
You know Randall's brother
was the Manny?

07:42.630 --> 07:45.165
His brother is Morris Chestnut?

07:45.198 --> 07:47.000
(chuckles)
No, the-the white Manny.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.269
-His brother is white?
-(laughs)

07:49.302 --> 07:51.104
-(slaps)
-Why aren't you more upset
that your son is out here

07:51.138 --> 07:53.306
skipping school and gallivanting
with his little fast girlfriend?

07:53.340 --> 07:55.375
Mom.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.077
Deja's not like that.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.847
Okay?
It was-it was my idea.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.616
After everything,
you still have the nerve

08:02.650 --> 08:04.217
to have these dumb ideas?

08:04.251 --> 08:06.820
Kel, the boy's only missed one
day of school in three years.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.455
It ain't the end of the world.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.490
Hmm.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.771
(phone whooshes)

08:40.087 --> 08:42.155
I can't believe
we're doing this.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.524
-Well, thanks to you, we are.
-Food's almost ready.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.126
Why don't you go upstairs
and get your sisters?

08:48.796 --> 08:50.764
Look, I know you're mad at me,

08:50.798 --> 08:52.900
but can you please
not take it out on Malik?

08:52.933 --> 08:55.368
I'm not mad at you,
I'm disappointed.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.037
All right.
Can we not do this now?

08:59.406 --> 09:01.575
-(doorbell rings)
-Uhp. They're here.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.747
Hey.
Open minds.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.222
*

09:15.255 --> 09:16.256
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.291
-Welcome to our home. Come on.
-Thanks.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.627
(speaking indistinctly)

09:19.660 --> 09:21.128
Thanks.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.096
Hey, kids, everyone.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.397
Hey, Mr. Lawrence.

09:24.431 --> 09:27.134
Hey. Randall, my man.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.569
(laughs)
This is Mrs. Lawrence.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.972
-RANDALL: Hi, nice to meet you.
-TRISH: Nice to meet you.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.974
-Hey. Glad you guys could...
-Shh.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.776
(whispers):
Baby's sleeping.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.728
First stop on our Philly tour:

09:54.762 --> 09:56.329
Max's Steaks.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.365
-All right. Let's go.
-(claps)

09:59.432 --> 10:01.234
Yo, yo.
What's up?

10:01.268 --> 10:02.636
-Hey.
-What up? What's up, man?

10:02.670 --> 10:03.937
-Hey, what's up, Leek?
-What's up?

10:03.971 --> 10:06.139
-What up, Jamar?
-Ain't nothing.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.308
-Uh, this is my friend Deja.
-What's up?

10:08.341 --> 10:10.477
-Let me get two Virgils.
-Two Virgils.

10:10.510 --> 10:13.313
Deja, everything on this menu
is fire, but that Virgil--

10:13.346 --> 10:15.515
that's hands down the best
cheesesteak in all of Philly.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.351
Aw, he just putting sauce on it
'cause Chuck the owner

10:18.385 --> 10:20.420
-named it after his grandpa.
-(laughter)

10:20.453 --> 10:22.455
Yo, let me go put
those orders in for y'all.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.591
Your granddad has a cheesesteak
named after him?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.593
(chuckles)
Yeah.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.762
Yeah, uh, him and Mr. Chuck
were real cool.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.364
God.
You're lucky.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.366
Why?

10:33.400 --> 10:35.635
You got all these connections.

10:35.669 --> 10:38.305
We literally walked up in here
and everybody said hi.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.808
That's so dope.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.543
I've moved around so much.

10:43.576 --> 10:46.747
I was never anywhere long enough
to be a regular.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.118
Come with me.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.453
-Just come on.
-Hey. Hey, where y'all going?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.823
-I'm about to be done
with your food.
-Hold on a second.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.661
Yo, yo, yo, everybody.
Everybody.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.297
Um, this is my friend Deja.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.700
She's never been to Max's
before, but it's not her fault.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.701
Y'all please say hi to her?

11:07.735 --> 11:09.569
-ALL: Hey, Deja.
-How you doing?

11:09.602 --> 11:11.872
(chuckles)
Now you're a regular.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.080
(door closes)

11:20.113 --> 11:22.182
-Hey, Mr. Pearson.
-Malik.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.517
Kelly, Darnell.
It's nice to meet you guys.

11:24.551 --> 11:27.254
These are our girls,
Tess and Annie.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.922
And you know Deja.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.424
Actually, I don't.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.993
You're a beautiful young lady.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.995
Thank you.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.964
It's crazy that you have a baby.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.602
So, dinner isn't quite
ready yet,

11:42.635 --> 11:45.538
but we do have wine,
lots of wine.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.174
-Anybody care for some wine?
-No, thank you.
-I don't drink.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.010
All right. Um, Kelly,
why don't you and I

11:50.043 --> 11:52.412
-put the pie in the kitchen,
all right?
-Yep.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.347
Ladies, why don't you help Malik
get Janell situated.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.983
Right this way.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.286
(Randall sighs)

11:59.319 --> 12:01.388
Dinner on a weeknight
must be a pain.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.623
Sorry about that.
Just thought it was important

12:03.656 --> 12:04.892
that we get together
and talk through

12:04.925 --> 12:06.026
what to do about
the kids sneaking around.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.360
Nah, it's cool.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.062
Plus, it gave me an excuse
to come down here.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.098
I used to trick or treat
in this neighborhood

12:11.131 --> 12:12.199
-when Malik was a baby.
-Really?

12:12.232 --> 12:13.767
Yeah.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.402
I always wondered what
the inside of these houses

12:15.435 --> 12:17.104
looked like.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.907
-You must have broke
the bank on this one.
-No.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.574
Or not.
(laughs)

12:21.608 --> 12:22.876
Good for you, Councilman.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.945
Oh, no, it's just Randall.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.580
You know, Randall is fine.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.050
Hi.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.220
I think Darnell just implied
that we're bougie.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.721
-We are kind of bougie.
-Yeah, okay.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.289
But I don't want him
to think that.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.825
Open-toed shoes, open minds.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.393
I'm not sure how I feel
about your mantra.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.129
How about a tour?

12:44.097 --> 12:47.034
(exhales sharply)
Well, this is my room.

12:48.635 --> 12:49.837
Ignore that side of the room.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.005
That's my brother.
He's a bit of a slob.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.241
Some of the brightest
people are.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.343
I don't think that theory
applies here.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.011
-Uh, Randall.
-Sorry.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.780
So this must be where
the books in the house live.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.682
RANDALL:
Yeah. The library sponsored

13:02.715 --> 13:04.117
a summer read-a-thon,
and I got so many new books,

13:04.151 --> 13:06.319
my dad had to buy this for me.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.288
Build.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.824
I didn't buy that,
I-I built that.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.293
-It's real oak.
-Wow.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.862
I was-I was thinking
about maple,

13:14.895 --> 13:16.964
but it's less porous.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.798
Makes a huge, huge difference.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.801
Really, you-you could have used
birch, uh, pine...

13:21.835 --> 13:24.704
Hey, Jack, you can stop
naming types of wood.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.874
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

13:26.907 --> 13:28.675
It looks sturdy.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.610
-Thanks.
-Hey, can we eat already?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.445
-I'm hungry.
-REBECCA: Yeah, we're gonna.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.181
And stop fussing
with your clothes.

13:34.214 --> 13:37.284
I see what you did
there, Randall.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.219
I knew you'd notice.
(chuckles)

13:39.252 --> 13:43.756
Mm, but you made one
little mistake.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.726
'76.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.662
-Bridge to Terabithia... '77.
-Oh.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.164
I'm sorry,
am I missing something?

13:51.198 --> 13:52.465
Mm-hmm.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.335
I organize the books in my class
by year of publication.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.204
But I should have
trademarked my process.

13:57.237 --> 14:00.207
-Seems we have a copycat
over here.
-(laughter)

14:00.240 --> 14:02.709
Holy crap, he's like
a grown-up Randall.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.011
-Kevin.
-Kev.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.346
KEVIN:
What? You don't see it?

14:06.379 --> 14:10.017
-JACK: Excuse us a second.
-Um... should we eat?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.351
-Definitely.
-Yeah?

14:11.384 --> 14:13.053
-Yeah.
-Dinner's ready, so we can, um,

14:13.086 --> 14:14.854
-trudge back downstairs.
-TRISH: Great.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.469
Her face is a whole mood.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.675
We got murals like this
all over the city.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.244
Kind of hard to believe people

14:37.277 --> 14:39.346
used to call Philly
Killadelphia.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.781
It's beautiful.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.722
(chuckles)

14:49.756 --> 14:51.591
What?

14:51.624 --> 14:54.227
Um...

14:54.261 --> 14:56.029
well, I was-I was about
to say something real cheesy,

14:56.063 --> 14:57.897
like... "No, you're beautiful."

14:57.931 --> 15:00.800
(both laugh)

15:00.833 --> 15:03.103
Does that actually work
on other girls?

15:06.073 --> 15:07.407
I don't know.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.610
Never really tried it before.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.286
*

15:20.487 --> 15:22.555
This is it,

15:22.589 --> 15:25.092
the magic garden.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.394
Crazy, right?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.096
* Boss ain't *

15:29.129 --> 15:31.898
* Workin' ya like this *

15:31.931 --> 15:35.068
* He can't take care of you
like this *

15:35.102 --> 15:37.637
* Now you're lost *

15:37.670 --> 15:40.207
* Lost in the heat of it all *

15:43.343 --> 15:45.845
* Girl, you know you're lost *

15:45.878 --> 15:48.515
* Lost in the thrill
of it all *

15:50.617 --> 15:53.586
* Miami, Amsterdam *

15:53.620 --> 15:55.855
* Tokyo, Spain, lost *

15:59.692 --> 16:01.261
* Los Angeles, India... *

16:01.294 --> 16:03.530
Are you okay?

16:03.563 --> 16:06.299
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.301
Okay.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.604
* Silk shirt, and it's Versace *

16:11.638 --> 16:13.973
It's good, right?

16:14.007 --> 16:15.775
-It's, like, real good.
-It's good.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.010
(both laugh)

16:17.044 --> 16:18.278
Let the tour commence.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.647
Commence the tour!

16:22.149 --> 16:24.951
What is this place?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.219
I used to stay near here
with my grandparents

16:26.253 --> 16:27.220
when I was a kid.

16:27.254 --> 16:30.890
This is, um...

16:30.923 --> 16:33.493
just kind of like my backyard.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.697
You know,
I take Janell here sometimes.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.733
This might be my favorite
spot in the city, actually.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.904
Nah, actually...

16:44.937 --> 16:48.108
this... is my favorite spot.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.279
We could share it if you want.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.348
Thanks.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.286
*

17:26.313 --> 17:28.315
*

17:41.294 --> 17:44.431
I... I ca-I can't...
I don't want to be here anymore.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.300
Oh, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have...

17:47.334 --> 17:48.968
I'm going now.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.037
That was my...

17:51.070 --> 17:54.006
*

17:58.578 --> 18:01.114
(girls talking softly to baby)

18:01.148 --> 18:02.182
(timer beeps)

18:05.152 --> 18:06.253
(timer beeps)

18:06.286 --> 18:08.488
I think the food is done.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.624
Oh, shoot.
Shoot.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.092
(groans)

18:13.126 --> 18:14.627
Ah...

18:14.661 --> 18:15.662
Let me give you a hand.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.341
Thanks.

18:28.375 --> 18:31.778
(groans)
We want it baked, not burnt.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.814
That's all right, I kind of like
my chicken cremated.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.716
(both laugh)

18:39.152 --> 18:42.255
I, uh, I spoke with
the kids' principal.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.791
They're only getting
one day's detention.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.426
The punishment
could have been much worse.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.461
It was my boy's doing.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.930
Guess he thought playing hooky
was smooth or something.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.699
The kid's a damn romantic.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.066
He gets it from me,
God help him.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.805
But he said he's sorry,
and it won't happen again.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.374
And when he says something
won't happen again, it won't.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.783
When he says someone's special,
she is.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.621
(girls cooing over baby)

19:14.654 --> 19:17.690
One day you're
their biggest idol,

19:17.724 --> 19:19.559
next day,
someone else comes along

19:19.592 --> 19:21.561
and becomes their whole world.

19:25.732 --> 19:28.201
It's terrifying.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.404
Yeah.

19:31.438 --> 19:34.641
It's nice, because the girls
get their own rooms.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.676
When we have guests,
they double up.

19:38.578 --> 19:41.013
Can I ask you something?

19:41.047 --> 19:42.549
How long have you had Deja?

19:44.451 --> 19:46.653
She's lived with us
for about two years.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.856
But we officially adopted her
about a year ago.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.926
Must be hard raising
someone else's child.

19:55.395 --> 19:58.064
No, because she's our daughter.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.933
Of course.
Of course.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.102
I just meant...

20:04.437 --> 20:07.340
She had a whole life before
she came into your family.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.941
Malik said her mother
was a drug addict,

20:08.975 --> 20:10.943
she lived in a car.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.945
That's a lot of baggage.

20:14.947 --> 20:18.385
Yeah, she's been through a lot.

20:18.418 --> 20:21.020
But, uh, so have you, right?

20:21.053 --> 20:23.390
I mean, having to raise
your child's child and all.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.326
RANDALL:
Dinner's ready.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.237
-Randall?
-Yes.

20:38.271 --> 20:41.641
Can I get your help with the
chips and the dip in the pantry?

20:41.674 --> 20:44.677
We're not having chips
and dip...

20:49.816 --> 20:51.818
You hide wine in the pantry?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.553
I got three kids, okay?
Give me a break.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.921
-(Randall sighs heavily)
-Randal?

20:54.954 --> 20:56.155
Hmm?

20:56.188 --> 20:57.590
This woman's about to make me
come out my spirit.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.159
For real? 'Cause Darnell
seems like a nice guy.

21:00.192 --> 21:03.162
Oh. I thought we were all about
getting people in boats

21:03.195 --> 21:04.564
and going to
Dejik Splitsville.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.433
I still am,
I was just trying to be

21:06.466 --> 21:08.601
all open-toed shoes
and open mind.

21:08.635 --> 21:09.902
I was wrong, okay?

21:09.936 --> 21:11.404
I don't want them in our boat.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.440
Kelly is trying to pin
this whole thing on our girl?

21:13.473 --> 21:14.841
(chuckles)

21:14.874 --> 21:16.309
This dinner is about to get
awkward as hell.

21:16.343 --> 21:18.345
It doesn't have to be...
Okay.

21:21.147 --> 21:22.482
Ah.

21:24.684 --> 21:25.918
(door slams shut)

21:25.952 --> 21:27.454
It's going really good.
You know, Mrs. Weber actually

21:27.487 --> 21:28.821
let us pick out the ones we want

21:28.855 --> 21:32.258
-to study for science class.
-Hm. Theropods or sauropods?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.926
Theropods, duh.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.362
(laughs)

21:35.395 --> 21:38.097
-This is the most boring dinner
in history.
-Kevin.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.866
Don't be rude.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.501
What? Ms. Applebaum
wouldn't be talking

21:41.534 --> 21:44.971
about dinosaurs at dinner.
She's way too cool for that.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.839
You're so obsessed with her.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.274
(whispers):
She's got big boobs.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.342
-Hey, Kevin.
-REBECCA: Excuse me.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.478
-Sorry.
-KOREY: No.

21:51.511 --> 21:54.313
It's my fault. 'Cause when
Randall and I start talking

21:54.347 --> 21:55.982
prehistoric reptiles...

21:56.015 --> 21:58.117
-(laughs)
-It gets really crazy.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.952
...it's hard for us stop.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.655
Didn't know
you taught dinosaurs.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.858
(clears throat)

22:07.727 --> 22:09.529
-Trish.
-Mm?

22:09.562 --> 22:10.730
I have to tell you,

22:10.763 --> 22:12.198
I've been admiring
your earrings all night.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.534
-Where did you get those?
-Thanks, Rebecca.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.570
I-I actually got them
from Taste of Afro-soul.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.138
What's that?

22:19.171 --> 22:22.208
It's-it's a cultural festival.

22:22.241 --> 22:25.011
Yeah, a bunch of black artists,
they get together,

22:25.044 --> 22:27.380
-and there's-there's food,
there's music,
-TRISH: Yeah.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.682
there's art, jewelry,
there's some poetry.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.684
Like the ones
you're teaching us in class?

22:31.718 --> 22:34.421
Uh-huh, some, yeah.

22:34.454 --> 22:38.090
Is it new--
the, um, the festival?

22:38.124 --> 22:40.860
-Uh...
-Yeah.

22:40.893 --> 22:44.196
Yeah, I think it's been around
for a few years now.

22:44.230 --> 22:47.467
-They hold it once a month.
-Mm.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.905
Hey, if you don't mind,
Mr. Lawrence, can I come

22:52.939 --> 22:54.941
with you and Mrs. Lawrence
next time you guys go?

22:54.974 --> 22:57.043
Randall, I don't think that you
should impose on them.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.946
-That's not fair to just ask.
-Oh, no, no, that would not be
an imposition at all.

22:59.979 --> 23:02.882
-Korey.
-What?

23:04.817 --> 23:07.520
Hey, you know, bud, we'll, uh,
go together as a family.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.557
That way, when Mr. Lawrence,
when he has a family,

23:10.590 --> 23:13.993
he can take them to that.

23:18.465 --> 23:20.967
Absolutely.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.636
You know, I-I actually think
it'll be good

23:23.670 --> 23:25.638
for you to all go together.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.740
Oh, we will.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.976
-Good.
-Good.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.145
This is way better
than dinosaurs.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.088
Deja. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Deja, Deja.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.056
Deja, wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:44.090 --> 23:47.393
Look, I-I-I'm sorry, okay?
I wasn't trying to do anything.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.762
-I know, I know.
-Then what's wrong?

23:49.796 --> 23:51.464
Look...

23:51.498 --> 23:54.634
Malik, I've never
liked anybody before.

23:56.669 --> 23:59.405
You give me butterflies.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.808
And...

24:01.841 --> 24:03.275
the way you look at me,

24:03.309 --> 24:04.744
I mean,

24:04.777 --> 24:08.581
I never thought anybody
could look at me like that.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.983
And the crazy things
you say to me, I mean,

24:11.017 --> 24:12.451
are they for real?

24:12.485 --> 24:14.654
I mean,

24:14.687 --> 24:17.356
the men that my mom dated
lied to her.

24:18.891 --> 24:21.928
I only know one man
who doesn't lie,

24:21.961 --> 24:24.964
and now...

24:24.997 --> 24:26.699
maybe I know two.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.137
But you've done this before.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.505
You've had girlfriends.

24:32.539 --> 24:35.174
You have a baby.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.679
I don't know if I can trust you.

24:41.480 --> 24:45.017
I-I don't know if every time
you tell me I'm beautiful,

24:45.051 --> 24:47.419
you just running game.
I don't know.

24:49.221 --> 24:51.691
All I know is I got plans
for my life.

24:53.092 --> 24:56.563
Real plans,
and this is all too scary.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.197
I never should've
skipped school.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.900
Just please take me back.

25:05.504 --> 25:09.041
We'll, uh, we'll be right back
with dessert.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.910
Hey, Bec, do you want
to get the pie

25:10.943 --> 25:13.345
and I'll get the ice cream
and the bowls?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.584
What is going on with you?

25:17.617 --> 25:19.285
What?

25:20.853 --> 25:22.789
-Jack.
-What?

25:24.056 --> 25:27.727
If you're competing with Korey
for your son,

25:27.760 --> 25:29.395
you're gonna win.

25:31.197 --> 25:34.200
I mean, that man in there,
he could be, uh, Albert Einstein

25:34.233 --> 25:36.736
and you would still win.

25:36.769 --> 25:39.038
'Cause our son is always
gonna choose you.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.674
Always.

25:41.708 --> 25:42.942
But if you do that--

25:42.975 --> 25:45.712
if you make him choose--

25:45.745 --> 25:48.881
then Randall's gonna miss out
on something really special.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.850
Something...

25:50.883 --> 25:53.586
something he really needs.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.655
And then where
would that leave him?

26:02.629 --> 26:05.932
Who's up for some pie?

26:07.667 --> 26:09.001
(Darnell clears his throat)

26:13.105 --> 26:14.974
I'm sorry, would you mind

26:15.007 --> 26:17.043
if we said a quick grace?

26:17.076 --> 26:19.245
-Mom, is that really necessary?
-No, it's fine.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.546
We usually say grace ourselves.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.615
We never say grace.

26:22.649 --> 26:25.317
We haven't even been to church
since your campaign.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.419
(laughs) No, that's only
'cause, you know,

26:27.453 --> 26:29.588
Sundays can be, uh...

26:29.622 --> 26:31.791
Different families
have different traditions.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.726
Some people say grace
and go to church,

26:33.760 --> 26:35.962
and some people know that God
knows what's in their hearts.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.131
All right. Uh, Kelly,

26:39.165 --> 26:40.499
you want to do the honors?

26:42.534 --> 26:45.805
Heavenly Father,
we thank you for this food.

26:45.838 --> 26:47.573
May it nourish our bodies.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.142
And, Lord, though we may not all

26:50.176 --> 26:51.644
worship you consistently,

26:51.678 --> 26:54.080
we thank you
for blessing us anyway.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.481
Amen.

26:55.514 --> 26:57.616
Amen. Amen.

26:57.650 --> 27:00.953
Thank you for that, um...
Let's-let's dig in.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.324
Can you pass the chicken,
please?

27:05.357 --> 27:07.326
So, Darnell, how's business?

27:07.359 --> 27:09.328
Got a body shop, right?

27:09.361 --> 27:11.497
Yeah, yeah, we do repairs
and custom work.

27:11.530 --> 27:14.200
Business is, uh, pretty good.
Appreciate you asking.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.435
Well, if there's ever anything
I can do for you

27:16.468 --> 27:18.738
as your Friendly Neighborhood
Councilman, you let me know.

27:23.009 --> 27:25.311
What?

27:25.344 --> 27:27.313
You didn't vote for me, did you?

27:27.346 --> 27:28.715
What, you're a Sol Brown man?

27:28.748 --> 27:31.217
Oh, no, no, no. I just, uh,

27:31.250 --> 27:32.719
I just don't mess with politics.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.353
I'll take care of mines

27:34.386 --> 27:36.288
and whatever I could do
to bless the block, I do.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.324
That's about it.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.859
(Janelle crying)

27:39.892 --> 27:43.362
She's probably hungry.
Get the bottle.

27:43.395 --> 27:46.398
MALIK:
Come on, come on.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.803
Good girl. It's okay.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.004
Can I help with her?

27:52.038 --> 27:53.740
Uh, I don't think
that's a good idea, baby.

27:53.773 --> 27:54.974
No, it's fine, it's fine.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.376
She, uh, she likes
making new friends.

27:57.409 --> 27:58.978
It's okay, it's okay. Come on.

27:59.011 --> 28:03.382
-It's okay, it's okay.
-Hi. Oh, I want one.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.251
No, you don't,
not till you're 50.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.821
Since Janelle is your daughter
and Deja's your girlfriend,

28:08.855 --> 28:10.757
that kind of makes Deja
her stepmom.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.024
-DEJA: Oh, my God, Annie.
-No,

28:12.058 --> 28:14.693
-certainly does not.
-Not anybody's stepmom.

28:14.727 --> 28:17.864
Okay, um, I-I think
that a-a walk

28:17.897 --> 28:20.266
will calm her down.
I'll just, I'll be back.

28:20.299 --> 28:23.102
-I'll go with him.
-No. You know what,
girls, upstairs.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.604
-But why? Dinner isn't over yet.
-Yes, it is.

28:25.637 --> 28:28.574
-What about Malik?
-Upstairs, now, please.

28:28.607 --> 28:29.776
Come on.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.553
All right.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.722
I think it's time
for some real talk.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.400
I'll go first. I don't think
that Malik and Deja

28:54.433 --> 28:56.302
-should be dating.
-We can agree on that.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.137
(chuckles)
They're just kids.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.039
If it's about the school,
you know,

29:00.072 --> 29:01.974
kids skip school sometimes,
right? Didn't you?

29:03.609 --> 29:06.578
No. Uh, but that's
only because Hanes Academy

29:06.612 --> 29:08.247
had a very strict
attendance policy.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.483
Every school does.
And that's not the point.

29:11.517 --> 29:12.819
What is the point?

29:13.853 --> 29:14.921
Do I have to be
the one to announce

29:14.954 --> 29:16.155
the elephant in the room here?

29:16.188 --> 29:18.090
I'm sorry, I didn't know
there was an elephant.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.291
Please announce it.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.727
Your son has a daughter.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.595
Okay, but you knew that
when you let Deja

29:23.629 --> 29:25.231
go to the movies
with him last week.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.433
-What movies?
-Deja didn't go
to any movies last week.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.668
Yes, she did. She...
Malik told me.

29:29.701 --> 29:31.770
She went to the movies
with him and his friends.

29:31.804 --> 29:34.841
Are you kidding me?
So she's sneaking around now?

29:34.874 --> 29:36.843
Mm. Not surprised.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.145
Okay, you know what, you tried
it with me earlier, Kelly.

29:39.178 --> 29:40.813
I'm-a need you
to not make it a habit.

29:40.847 --> 29:43.449
Your problem
is not with me, okay?

29:43.482 --> 29:44.851
Your problem is upstairs.

29:44.884 --> 29:48.254
No, our problem is that Malik
is too experienced for Deja.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.289
She never lied to us
before she met your son.

29:50.322 --> 29:53.092
And my son never cut school
before he met your daughter.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.526
All right,
so can we all just agree

29:54.560 --> 29:56.128
that the two of them
are not good together

29:56.162 --> 29:57.864
and leave it at that?

29:57.897 --> 30:00.632
I don't think anyone here
wants an unplanned pregnancy.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.969
Oh, plea... Malik is not
having sex with Deja.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.204
And you know that how, hmm?
Because he told you?

30:05.237 --> 30:07.606
Did he tell you that
about Janelle's mother, too?

30:07.639 --> 30:09.141
Hey, Beth.

30:09.175 --> 30:12.511
Come on.

30:12.544 --> 30:16.182
All right.
Look, obviously, you're not

30:16.215 --> 30:17.783
catching us at our best...

30:17.816 --> 30:19.385
-Mm.
-...but Deja came

30:19.418 --> 30:22.621
from a tough situation,
and we brought her out of it.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.457
And, frankly, we're a little
concerned that her spending time

30:25.491 --> 30:27.493
with your son will take her
right back there.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.829
Where's that?

30:33.065 --> 30:34.233
Nothing.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.534
-Forget it.
-Uh-uh. No.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.569
-You were saying something.
Finish up.
-Yeah.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.571
I mean...

30:39.605 --> 30:42.208
Our son's gonna
drag her right back where?

30:42.241 --> 30:43.809
The hood?

30:43.842 --> 30:45.544
That's not what I was trying
to say, all right.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.917
What are you doing?

30:50.950 --> 30:54.020
I saw you eyeballing
my tats earlier.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.655
These ain't decorations, bro.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.425
I earned each and every one of
these living that life for real.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.460
But that's all behind me now.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.997
Look, you can choose to see me

31:05.031 --> 31:06.565
and only see my mistakes,

31:06.598 --> 31:08.267
or you can choose
to see something different.

31:08.300 --> 31:11.537
Just like you can choose
to see our son

31:11.570 --> 31:14.440
as a kid from North Philly,
teenage father.

31:16.142 --> 31:19.745
Or you could choose to see
a straight-A student,

31:19.778 --> 31:22.781
a sweet boy that loves to make
his mother and daughter smile.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.586
But what you not gonna do
is write him off.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.621
I ain't having that.

31:32.591 --> 31:35.294
I'm sorry.

31:38.464 --> 31:42.134
Randall, Beth,
I'm-I'm sorry I lied.

31:42.168 --> 31:44.770
I'm sorry for skipping school
yesterday.

31:44.803 --> 31:47.806
I'm-I'm sorry
I disappointed you.

31:50.809 --> 31:52.211
Mr. and Mrs. Hodges,

31:52.244 --> 31:54.580
I'm sorry for skipping school
with Malik,

31:54.613 --> 31:57.916
but I am not sorry
for liking your son.

32:00.186 --> 32:01.820
And I'm not sorry
for yesterday,

32:01.853 --> 32:04.156
because that was
the best day of my life.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.161
-Hey, wait-wait-wait-wait-wait.
-Malik.

32:09.195 --> 32:10.662
No, just,
just hear me out, okay?

32:12.664 --> 32:13.966
(sighs)

32:14.000 --> 32:15.634
Deja, I don't have game.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.304
I don't.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.839
Janelle's mom
was my first girlfriend.

32:20.872 --> 32:22.474
I still don't why
she liked me.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.276
(chuckling): I mean, we got
football players at our school,

32:24.310 --> 32:26.678
I'm, like, this big.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.650
But I get how you see me.

32:34.987 --> 32:36.688
A lot of people
see me like that.

32:40.026 --> 32:41.693
I remember when I first
told my parents

32:41.727 --> 32:43.729
I got Jennifer pregnant.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.568
The look on my dad's face.

32:56.542 --> 32:59.145
You know how long my parents
been together?

33:02.514 --> 33:04.350
22 years.

33:07.153 --> 33:09.355
My grandparents
were together for 60.

33:09.388 --> 33:13.059
Hell, I bet my ancestors
in Africa were even booed up.

33:15.094 --> 33:17.063
And I let them all down.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.732
I like you, Deja.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.071
That's the truth.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.377
And when I tell you
you're beautiful,

33:31.410 --> 33:32.911
that's the truth, too.

33:37.116 --> 33:40.652
Look, if you really want to go
back to school, that's okay.

33:40.686 --> 33:41.987
I understand.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.022
But, uh...

33:46.292 --> 33:49.228
I-I did have one more place
I wanted to show you.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.873
Show me.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.553
Thank you for coming over.
(chuckles)

34:16.922 --> 34:18.724
Thank you.

34:21.460 --> 34:22.561
Okay.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.397
Okay.

34:30.502 --> 34:31.570
Okay.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.307
Korey.

34:35.341 --> 34:37.943
(crickets chirping)

34:37.976 --> 34:40.112
Can I have a word?

34:42.148 --> 34:43.582
I'll wait for you
in the car.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.021
Hey. Um...

34:51.857 --> 34:54.126
Tonight was, um...

34:55.427 --> 34:58.164
Look, Jack, we don't
have to tiptoe around it.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.431
Tonight was awkward.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.634
It wasn't my finest.

35:03.669 --> 35:05.103
Yeah, mine either.

35:06.138 --> 35:08.707
Ever since Randall met you...

35:13.145 --> 35:15.914
All right.
If I'm being honest,

35:15.947 --> 35:20.051
ever since Randall could talk,
he would ask me questions.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.657
"Why is everybody
staring at us, Dad?"

35:25.691 --> 35:28.427
"Wh-why don't we have
any black neighbors?"

35:28.460 --> 35:30.629
He-he would ask questions,

35:30.662 --> 35:33.098
and I always had an answer
for him.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.101
I-I don't know how good
the answers were,

35:36.134 --> 35:39.271
but I had them.

35:39.305 --> 35:44.042
And lately, his questions
have gotten...

35:44.075 --> 35:46.011
very complicated.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.182
And I feel like
I'm letting him down.

35:53.352 --> 35:56.188
That kid is my whole world.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.627
And I...

36:01.660 --> 36:03.562
I'm out of my depth here.

36:07.266 --> 36:10.469
You know,
I only applied to Hanes

36:10.502 --> 36:12.304
'cause it's the best,

36:12.338 --> 36:15.874
and I wanted to teach
at the best.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.176
But I knew I'd be
the only one there.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.079
So...

36:21.112 --> 36:23.582
I guess when I met Randall...
(chuckles)

36:24.750 --> 36:25.884
...I understood him.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.321
And then when I saw that
he was searching,

36:29.355 --> 36:32.224
I just, I felt like I could help
him with all that.

36:32.258 --> 36:34.760
-Well, you can.
-No.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.265
I get him from 8:00 to 3:00,
five days a week.

36:39.298 --> 36:43.369
I mean, if I'm lucky, one day,
he'll remember me

36:43.402 --> 36:47.273
as someone who was
vaguely important to him once.

36:49.275 --> 36:50.709
But you're his father.

36:50.742 --> 36:54.012
Yeah, you're gonna be
a grandfather to his children.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.547
You're gonna be
with him forever.

36:55.581 --> 36:58.684
Korey, I-I can't teach my son
how to be black.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.887
(chuckles)

37:01.920 --> 37:03.622
Oh, no.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.391
No, don't, don't do that.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.925
(chuckling):
Okay?

37:06.958 --> 37:09.995
'Cause you-you,
you can't do that.

37:11.630 --> 37:15.301
All right, hold on,
one, one second. Just hold on.

37:18.604 --> 37:20.238
KOREY (quietly):
One second.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.642
(Trish sighs)

37:28.280 --> 37:32.551
(exhales)
This... is The Weary Blues.

37:32.584 --> 37:37.255
By one of the baddest scribes
ever to live, Langston Hughes.

37:37.289 --> 37:39.425
I was gonna give this
to Randall,

37:39.458 --> 37:42.127
but my wife told me
to leave it in the car.

37:43.161 --> 37:46.465
Randall is... he's really
into his work.

37:55.140 --> 37:58.944
-Thanks.
-Yeah. Well, um...

37:58.977 --> 38:01.413
I'll see you
at the parent-teacher meeting.

38:01.447 --> 38:02.714
-See you there.
-Yeah.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.804
(alarm chirps)

38:34.346 --> 38:35.381
Hey.

38:36.415 --> 38:38.283
Hi.

38:38.316 --> 38:42.120
So... Mr. Lawrence.

38:42.153 --> 38:45.391
He's a pretty cool guy.
I can see why you like him.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.659
He's okay.

38:47.693 --> 38:51.029
No, he's, um...

38:51.062 --> 38:52.664
he's pretty cool.

38:53.699 --> 38:57.202
Yeah, he, he, he gave me this.

38:57.235 --> 39:00.071
He said that you liked it a lot.
I'm planning on reading it, too.

39:00.105 --> 39:03.975
-You are?
-Mm-hm.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.811
This is a book of poetry, Dad.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.379
What, I like poetry.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.415
Sure you do. (chuckles)

39:09.448 --> 39:12.384
(chuckling):
Okay, I'll take that back, then.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.387
(knocking on door)

39:19.024 --> 39:22.093
You're grounded for a week
for lying to us.

39:23.128 --> 39:26.598
It cannot happen again.

39:29.134 --> 39:32.871
Randall and I talked,
and we agreed

39:32.904 --> 39:34.239
that you can see Malik.

39:35.273 --> 39:39.044
-Seriously?
-But supervised.

39:39.077 --> 39:42.247
All right? Either in this house
when Beth and I are home,

39:42.280 --> 39:44.983
or at Malik's house,
when his parents are home.

39:46.918 --> 39:50.622
We didn't really get
to know Malik tonight...

39:52.323 --> 39:55.393
...but we'd like to.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.295
Mind telling us about him?

40:00.999 --> 40:04.970
-Can I look now?
-Hold on, just wait a second.

40:05.003 --> 40:06.572
Well, he's obsessed
with cheesesteaks.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.306
(chuckles)

40:08.339 --> 40:11.543
He's very confident.
Not cocky.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.111
And...

40:13.144 --> 40:15.481
he's the type of guy
that walks into a room

40:15.514 --> 40:18.416
-and everyone notices.
-MALIK: Now.

40:25.757 --> 40:26.925
G.G., it's sticky.

40:26.958 --> 40:30.161
(chuckles)
Yeah.

40:30.195 --> 40:32.130
And you're getting it
everywhere, baby girl.

40:32.163 --> 40:35.233
-Dayje?
-Yeah, Mama?

40:35.266 --> 40:36.468
Look outside, tater-tot.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.604
You see the lights?

40:38.637 --> 40:40.105
They're pretty, right?

40:40.138 --> 40:42.508
Mm-hmm.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.947
DEJA:
The thing about Malik is,

40:48.980 --> 40:52.751
he makes me feel like myself.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.521
Like I have a piece of home.

40:57.556 --> 40:59.725
Oh, damn, did I mess up again?

41:03.461 --> 41:05.531
No, you didn't mess up at all.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.277
(chuckles)

41:19.310 --> 41:21.479
You know, I actually memorized
my favorite one.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.415
You did?

41:26.918 --> 41:28.554
Can I hear it?

41:34.926 --> 41:37.996
"I, Too."

41:38.029 --> 41:39.965
"I, too, sing America.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.700
"I am the darker brother.

41:41.733 --> 41:44.469
"They send me
to eat in the kitchen,

41:44.502 --> 41:46.204
"when company comes.

41:46.237 --> 41:50.676
"But I laugh, and I eat well,
and I grow strong.

41:50.709 --> 41:54.345
"Tomorrow, I'll be at the table.

41:54.379 --> 41:56.982
"When company comes,
nobody'll dare say to me,

41:57.015 --> 41:58.216
"'eat in the kitchen,' then.

41:58.249 --> 42:02.153
"Besides, they'll see
how beautiful we are, and...

42:02.187 --> 42:04.756
"be ashamed.

42:07.058 --> 42:11.229
I, too, am America."

42:14.733 --> 42:17.268
We could read that together.

42:17.302 --> 42:18.670
If you want.

42:18.704 --> 42:21.640
I would like that very much.
