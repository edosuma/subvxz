00:00.034 --> 00:01.765
He said Daddy was here!

00:01.767 --> 00:03.032
Daddy wasn't!

00:03.034 --> 00:04.532
Daddy would say hello.

00:04.534 --> 00:06.432
It's made my choice for me.

00:06.434 --> 00:07.999
Cap-Ferrat.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.132
When?

00:09.134 --> 00:10.498
As soon as possible.

00:10.500 --> 00:13.231
Shabbat's an invitation,
not an obligation.

00:13.233 --> 00:14.265
It's more than just that.

00:14.267 --> 00:16.099
Rightly or wrongly, I don't approve.

00:16.101 --> 00:17.398
I must find a way to.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.198
Much needs changing.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.699
I need changing.

00:20.701 --> 00:22.298
Are you free tomorrow?

00:22.300 --> 00:24.331
The Neil Burton?

00:24.333 --> 00:25.765
Why would he want to come here?

00:25.767 --> 00:27.999
This Dr. Duncan, he's...
he's been here yonks.

00:28.001 --> 00:29.565
He's basically a GP.

00:29.567 --> 00:32.165
The board's asked to discuss my leaving.

00:32.168 --> 00:33.632
No!

00:33.634 --> 00:35.099
I'm disposable. Neil's not.

00:35.101 --> 00:37.365
Hospital needs him more than me.

00:37.367 --> 00:39.298
I have to find my place within that.

00:39.300 --> 00:43.099
I won't keep limiting myself
because Jack fears change.

00:43.101 --> 00:44.598
Why is he so stuck?

00:44.600 --> 00:46.331
We can't keep on this way.

00:46.333 --> 00:49.066
I've made a decision about the future.

00:49.068 --> 00:50.398
It feels good.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.532
- Tell me.
- When I'm back.

00:52.534 --> 00:55.665
One can but hope Sydney
might sing a siren song.

00:55.667 --> 00:56.965
It's about Doris.

00:56.967 --> 00:58.732
Henry and I were kissing.

00:58.734 --> 01:00.734
I think she might have seen, driving up.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.298
Doris, whatever you're
feeling, say nothing.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.699
We'll speak more tomorrow.

01:06.701 --> 01:08.532
Where's my wife?

01:08.534 --> 01:11.734
You stinking, flaming...

01:14.101 --> 01:15.699
It all came back.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.231
Just when I'm happiest
and everything is perfect.

01:18.233 --> 01:20.901
It's... It's always been that way.

01:21.967 --> 01:23.132
Sarah?

01:25.434 --> 01:26.534
Sarah!

Sarah!

02:01.434 --> 02:02.567
Sarah!

02:39.534 --> 02:41.532
I'm not praying.

02:41.534 --> 02:42.967
What are you doing?

02:44.300 --> 02:47.398
I was heading to work
and I had to come here.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.699
You rushed out.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.565
I want the clinic in order
before patients arrive.

02:50.567 --> 02:52.765
There'll be enough talk.

02:52.767 --> 02:54.168
But you're here.

03:09.134 --> 03:10.565
You didn't even see David.

03:10.567 --> 03:12.665
I was in no mood for questions.

03:12.667 --> 03:13.767
Is that all?

03:16.233 --> 03:18.001
Why here?

03:18.767 --> 03:21.068
I haven't been since we returned.

03:21.867 --> 03:22.999
It just hit you.

03:23.001 --> 03:24.400
In passing.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.667
Nothing else?

03:32.168 --> 03:35.034
There's enough real turmoil
without you creating it.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.834
- I'm worried.
- Don't be.

03:41.567 --> 03:42.834
Please.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.066
You know where I am if you need to talk.

03:48.068 --> 03:50.166
There's nothing to say.

03:50.168 --> 03:51.634
If there is.

04:10.934 --> 04:12.699
<i>Wieder an die arbeit!</i>

04:12.701 --> 04:15.231
<i>- Je suis là.</i>
<i>- René !</i>

04:18.300 --> 04:21.132
<i>Tues-moi.</i>

04:21.134 --> 04:22.498
I said stay!

04:57.068 --> 04:59.400
I'm sure you've heard about last night.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.567
We need repairs as soon as possible.

05:06.101 --> 05:07.331
Thank you.

05:17.934 --> 05:19.932
Personally, I love it.

05:19.934 --> 05:21.231
They can't but not.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.600
I'll rustle them up.

05:28.267 --> 05:30.265
Wow.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.899
Are you sure?

05:35.901 --> 05:37.598
Even half-asleep.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.465
And half-dressed.

05:39.467 --> 05:41.331
Delia insisted. It was
the first thing to hand.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.498
In lieu of Prudence.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.365
A whole new you.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.166
- This your doing?
- By request.

05:47.168 --> 05:49.999
Good on you. Good on <i>you.</i>

05:50.001 --> 05:51.598
And I call Carolyn fripperous.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.565
Oh, here's to frippery.

05:53.567 --> 05:55.967
A fresh look for a fresh start.

05:57.134 --> 05:59.400
Maybe I need a
freshen-up, too, for mine.

06:00.834 --> 06:01.899
You do look marvelous.

06:01.901 --> 06:04.034
And you rather comical.

06:04.934 --> 06:06.500
Uh, what fresh start?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.598
- I'll dress.
- And spoil our fun?

06:09.600 --> 06:11.699
Exactly. Won't be a tick.

06:11.701 --> 06:14.001
Hopefully excites you as much as me.

06:20.734 --> 06:22.434
Did I not say?

06:24.333 --> 06:27.166
Well, if you do see him,
tell him I'm looking for him.

06:27.168 --> 06:29.999
And spread the word amongst
any friends I might not know.

06:30.001 --> 06:31.134
Thank you.

06:32.701 --> 06:33.765
No luck?

06:33.767 --> 06:36.099
I've exhausted the possible numbers.

06:36.101 --> 06:37.665
He was seeing a specialist.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.867
They won't give out
appointment information.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.265
I think I'll head off with Livvy.

06:42.267 --> 06:45.099
Perhaps it'll help if
I present in person.

06:45.101 --> 06:47.765
And I need to follow
through on the new film deal.

06:47.767 --> 06:49.099
To see your publisher?

06:49.101 --> 06:51.498
No, with Burbank National Pictures.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.932
They're in town. They want
to get in ahead of Fox.

06:53.934 --> 06:55.732
Oh.

06:55.734 --> 06:58.999
That should be interesting,
given your condition.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.367
They need to know sometime.

07:01.168 --> 07:02.298
Do they?

07:02.300 --> 07:04.032
My publisher certainly does.

07:04.034 --> 07:05.801
Discretion wouldn't harm.

07:07.434 --> 07:09.632
That's all I'll say. You finished?

07:09.634 --> 07:10.634
Yes.

07:19.801 --> 07:22.068
- A private call.
- Of course.

07:26.101 --> 07:28.867
Mildred, a Canberra number, please.

07:29.934 --> 07:31.634
The Israeli Embassy.

07:37.734 --> 07:40.965
You'll bounce in like a rubber
ball after three of those.

07:40.967 --> 07:42.801
I'll need my wits about me.

07:43.467 --> 07:45.934
How do you expect Mr. Burton to respond?

07:48.068 --> 07:49.434
I can only try.

07:51.001 --> 07:52.267
What do you think?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.865
As you say, try.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.498
The idea has merit.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.367
See if he agrees.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.732
Where do you bounce now?

08:02.734 --> 08:04.099
Mm?

08:04.101 --> 08:06.132
Oh, look at you.

08:06.134 --> 08:07.932
What's next?

08:07.934 --> 08:10.567
Well, the house is mine again.

08:11.233 --> 08:13.832
I can either find a
charitable use for it

08:13.834 --> 08:16.965
or sell it and distribute the funds.

08:16.967 --> 08:18.999
What, not live there?

08:19.001 --> 08:21.001
Until I work out what to do with it.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.032
Perhaps I'll return here.

08:24.034 --> 08:26.567
Prudence ensures that
life is never dull.

08:29.034 --> 08:32.232
I think Douglas would approve
of a philanthropic endeavor.

08:32.833 --> 08:34.801
Well, the obvious thought's the refuge.

08:35.534 --> 08:38.631
Well, it's doing well as it stands.

08:38.634 --> 08:40.032
Something of my own, I think.

08:40.034 --> 08:43.267
Something for women,
as Douglas helped men.

08:44.534 --> 08:46.600
You sound like Caro or Anna.

08:47.867 --> 08:51.500
Or what I might have been had
I been born into their eras.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.999
Now, this is but a
hint of change to come.

08:56.001 --> 08:58.233
They'll be impressed.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.500
You?

09:01.300 --> 09:02.567
Goes without saying.

09:05.134 --> 09:07.999
Well, hopefully I come back
with my own impressive news.

09:08.001 --> 09:09.465
Oh, good luck.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.367
And then we'll head back together.

09:12.467 --> 09:14.400
For my Ash Park unveiling.

09:14.967 --> 09:19.333
And I have amends to make.

09:50.001 --> 09:51.732
Come!

09:53.333 --> 09:54.901
Ah, Doctor.

09:56.233 --> 09:58.198
I believe an emergency
brought you to town.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.532
Yes.

09:59.534 --> 10:02.598
I ran into Mr. Fox, off to
get advice about his hand.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.699
Your emergency patient,
it seems, will survive

10:04.701 --> 10:06.767
but won't be the man he was.

10:07.567 --> 10:08.567
Yeah.

10:10.367 --> 10:13.734
You, uh, have a proposition, you say?

10:16.400 --> 10:17.467
Yes.

10:19.701 --> 10:21.699
You didn't give me much of a go.

10:21.701 --> 10:25.032
I made a quick, yet I
believe fair, judgment.

10:25.034 --> 10:26.434
I thought I was interviewing you.

10:27.034 --> 10:29.965
I came to take the
measure of the situation.

10:29.967 --> 10:32.865
I found the hospital, its
potential at least, attractive.

10:32.867 --> 10:33.867
You not so.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.699
I'm happy to outline why.

10:36.701 --> 10:39.365
So that was it, no discussion,
just straight to the board,

10:39.367 --> 10:40.732
digging a hole under me six feet deep?

10:40.734 --> 10:43.565
I did my homework, spoke to
certain objective parties.

10:43.567 --> 10:44.832
Richard Bennett?

10:44.834 --> 10:46.198
Well, he did fund the surgical wing.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.532
Well, he's hardly objective.

10:49.534 --> 10:52.132
The board has supported his assessment.

10:52.134 --> 10:55.498
Well-meaning, well-liked,
but mired in the past.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.665
Mr. Fox, I'm told, had
to battle you for change.

10:57.667 --> 10:59.331
Mr. Fox went about it wrong.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.532
It's not my job to drag
you into the future.

11:01.534 --> 11:03.765
Your diplomas showed
you've done no further study

11:03.767 --> 11:04.832
since you left medical school.

11:04.834 --> 11:08.166
- I keep up with the journals.
- But no actual credentials.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.265
Your rural location is no excuse.

11:10.267 --> 11:12.032
Your patients deserve
the latest treatment

11:12.034 --> 11:13.432
as much as anyone else.

11:13.434 --> 11:14.667
They are looked after.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.967
Well, perhaps not as
well as I'd like to see.

11:21.367 --> 11:25.333
I will appreciate your
cooperation in this transition.

11:28.834 --> 11:30.801
I'm here to offer more than that.

11:33.467 --> 11:36.231
You want forward thinking, you got it.

11:36.233 --> 11:39.398
And you'll have your
hospital all to yourself.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.365
A whole new aspect of care for the area,

11:41.367 --> 11:42.598
under me, independent,

11:42.600 --> 11:44.300
and I'll do the studies to back it up.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.001
Let's see how much you
really care about the locals.

12:08.168 --> 12:10.500
- No Doris yet?
- No, Sister.

12:24.801 --> 12:26.567
I've been expecting you.

12:27.567 --> 12:29.331
Well, there's, uh, little to say.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.034
It needs discussing.

12:34.767 --> 12:36.300
It must have been a shock for you.

12:37.068 --> 12:39.465
As an intimate of Ash Park,

12:39.467 --> 12:43.331
I've embraced many unorthodox trends.

12:43.333 --> 12:46.865
Your ways, loose views on divorce,

12:46.867 --> 12:51.265
Miss Anna, first Catholic,
now unwed and expecting.

12:51.267 --> 12:54.598
I see now why she broke off
her engagement with Mr. Fox.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.066
- Doris...
- And I say to myself,

12:56.068 --> 12:58.699
"Doris, times are changing.
You must change, too."

12:58.701 --> 13:01.331
But this I cannot condone.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.632
So much is clear now.

13:03.634 --> 13:08.032
James Bligh's friendships,
his sudden flight overseas.

13:08.034 --> 13:10.665
Even veiled remarks by Regina Bligh

13:10.667 --> 13:12.166
that now make sense.

13:12.168 --> 13:16.032
You must, of course,
perhaps accept these things,

13:16.034 --> 13:17.231
with it in the family.

13:17.233 --> 13:19.231
But I cannot.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.899
And I will not. But I will not tell.

13:21.901 --> 13:24.099
- If I could please...
- I will arrange for someone else

13:24.101 --> 13:27.532
to take over the book cart
until I can manage a good face.

13:27.534 --> 13:29.532
- There, I've had my say.
- Please!

13:29.534 --> 13:31.365
It's a perversion I cannot condone.

13:31.367 --> 13:34.801
It goes against the
laws of God and nature.

13:37.068 --> 13:40.265
I have seen that thinking
used to justify murder.

13:40.267 --> 13:42.298
- Nonsense.
- I was there.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.899
I saw.

13:43.901 --> 13:46.365
They were rounded up
along with the Jews.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.498
<i>"Warmer Bruder, du schwein."</i>

13:48.500 --> 13:50.732
They died along with us.

13:50.734 --> 13:52.267
You're no better than the Nazis.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.400
Excuse me.

14:32.867 --> 14:34.865
Put your back into it, son.

14:40.034 --> 14:42.434
Good to see you back at the old place.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.865
Get Emma back to school?

14:46.867 --> 14:47.901
Yeah.

14:49.233 --> 14:51.398
Things all right?

14:51.400 --> 14:52.534
Gettin' better.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.400
You've been missed.

14:57.068 --> 14:59.267
Might be missed more, I reckon.

15:02.867 --> 15:04.101
I've been thinking.

15:05.434 --> 15:07.001
How'd you like it?

15:08.467 --> 15:10.732
- What do you mean?
- How'd you like to own it?

15:10.734 --> 15:12.465
Be yours.

15:12.467 --> 15:15.500
Sell? You can't.

15:16.434 --> 15:18.801
I've been offered a job
at Ash Park if I want it.

15:20.300 --> 15:21.799
There's too many bad memories here.

15:21.801 --> 15:22.865
Yeah, but...

15:22.867 --> 15:25.032
If I stayed, I'd just turn into

15:25.034 --> 15:28.267
the miserable old coot I was
when Missy first got here.

15:30.134 --> 15:31.134
So do you want it?

15:32.467 --> 15:33.667
Of course.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.198
But I can't.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.765
We can sort something
out about the money.

15:37.767 --> 15:39.732
It's more than that.

15:39.734 --> 15:41.867
There'd be a problem in staying.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.865
Mr. Briggs.

16:03.867 --> 16:05.765
Looks like you could do
with a hand there, Doris.

16:05.767 --> 16:09.565
Oh, no, I'm making good use of
my time free of the book cart.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.832
Yeah, about that.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.231
I caught up with what's what.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.834
Harry Polson told me.

16:15.734 --> 16:17.066
Oh.

16:17.068 --> 16:19.832
I had hoped you were here
to report on young Emma.

16:19.834 --> 16:21.899
Oh, she's pleased as punch to be back.

16:21.901 --> 16:23.198
Mm-hmm.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.701
I'm selling my spread.

16:25.267 --> 16:27.899
Mr. Briggs, you're not leaving us?

16:27.901 --> 16:29.999
- No, you mustn't.
- No, of course not.

16:30.001 --> 16:32.799
No, Ash Park'll do me just fine for now.

16:32.801 --> 16:33.934
Gimme that.

16:34.801 --> 16:36.767
I've offered it to Harry.

16:37.934 --> 16:40.801
I reckon I can snag him
a loan through Missy.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.899
I've known about him for yonks.

16:43.901 --> 16:47.166
Threw me at first, but a
good bloke's a good bloke,

16:47.168 --> 16:49.101
even if he does like blokes.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.967
Give me one Harry over
10 Stan O'Rourkes any day.

16:56.567 --> 16:58.899
It is unnatural.

16:58.901 --> 17:00.032
Not to him it's not.

17:00.034 --> 17:02.099
Or Henry Fox.

17:02.101 --> 17:03.600
Or James Bligh.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.367
That slipped out.

17:08.634 --> 17:10.267
I guessed as much.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.665
Those blokes have it harder than most.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.598
They're tossed aside
by their loved ones.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.397
Blackmail, bashings.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.565
James spent time in a loony bin.

17:19.567 --> 17:21.165
They have it pretty tough.

17:21.167 --> 17:22.565
The Lord said...

17:22.567 --> 17:25.500
The Lord makes rules that
we all break every day.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.598
I don't understand it, but
I'm not about to judge it,

17:29.600 --> 17:31.567
especially when they're three good men.

17:33.967 --> 17:35.132
Dear Dawn...

17:35.134 --> 17:36.799
Oh, Dawnie figured it out.

17:36.801 --> 17:38.500
She still had time for 'em but.

17:40.300 --> 17:44.298
Look, I saw them kissing.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.300
Yeah.

17:47.101 --> 17:49.565
Not something I'd rush to see.

17:49.567 --> 17:50.899
But in private, right?

17:50.901 --> 17:52.734
Where's the harm?

17:55.734 --> 17:57.365
The Bible says...

17:57.367 --> 17:58.832
Drop the Lord bit.

17:58.834 --> 18:00.398
I'll tell you what.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.799
Go inside, go through your Bible,

18:02.801 --> 18:05.565
start listing down all the
things it says you shouldn't do

18:05.567 --> 18:07.032
that you do.

18:07.034 --> 18:08.799
And be honest, mind.

18:08.801 --> 18:09.932
Then come back out.

18:09.934 --> 18:11.231
I'll be ready for a cold one by then.

18:11.233 --> 18:13.432
- Oh!
- Off you go.

18:13.434 --> 18:15.565
If you can't find any, judge away.

18:15.567 --> 18:19.267
But if you do, show
some ruddy compassion.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.701
Scoot.

18:31.467 --> 18:33.032
There'll be seven.

18:33.034 --> 18:36.832
Use the best setting, as
it's a farewell dinner.

18:36.834 --> 18:39.198
- Georgie and David?
- Oh, we'll get them to bed.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.999
Service at 7:30.

18:41.001 --> 18:42.101
Any particular menu?

18:43.600 --> 18:46.465
Lamb with mint sauce. Treacle pudding.

18:46.467 --> 18:48.367
Give her some good country fare to miss.

18:49.867 --> 18:54.231
A thorough dusting of any
rooms Mrs. Goddard might use.

18:54.233 --> 18:57.699
And Mrs. Bligh organized it, right?

18:57.701 --> 18:58.867
I understand.

19:08.634 --> 19:10.498
You're on fire!

19:10.500 --> 19:13.565
Judith called. I'm booked
to see the Americans.

19:13.567 --> 19:15.565
Suggestions for the adaptation.

19:15.567 --> 19:17.132
Ah, will they want them?

19:17.134 --> 19:18.434
I'm giving them.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.231
Wear something loose.

19:21.233 --> 19:22.432
Best it's not an issue.

19:22.434 --> 19:24.099
I'll see.

19:24.101 --> 19:25.498
Don't be perverse.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.200
I'll see how I feel on the day.

19:31.634 --> 19:34.132
Olivia's dinner all arranged?

19:34.134 --> 19:37.099
To all intents and
purposes, all Sarah's doing.

19:37.101 --> 19:40.032
Mother will sail in,
looking to find fault.

19:40.034 --> 19:41.465
She will find none.

19:41.467 --> 19:45.432
Sarah shouldn't have to
pretend any more than me.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.799
Why invite problems?

19:47.801 --> 19:50.265
She certainly doesn't need them
in her current state of mind.

19:50.267 --> 19:51.532
Why?

19:51.534 --> 19:53.532
- Why what?
- Well, why now?

19:53.534 --> 19:55.331
Sarah has every reason to be happy.

19:55.333 --> 19:56.365
The shot missed.

19:56.367 --> 19:58.699
It was fired.

19:58.701 --> 20:00.001
Enough tension over time.

20:00.834 --> 20:03.632
All we can do is see
Mother's visit goes smoothly.

20:03.634 --> 20:05.734
- We don't need the twang.
- Hm?

20:06.634 --> 20:08.166
Of strings snapping.

20:08.168 --> 20:09.498
Sarah's or hers.

20:40.801 --> 20:41.801
Mr. Polson.

20:43.101 --> 20:44.567
Mrs. Collins.

20:51.967 --> 20:52.967
I baked.

20:59.901 --> 21:02.465
- Thank you.
- There are many young ladies

21:02.467 --> 21:04.799
who'd be so very happy
with a husband like you.

21:04.801 --> 21:05.965
Not the way I am.

21:05.967 --> 21:08.632
- But...
- And I am how I am.

21:08.634 --> 21:11.467
- But to choose...
- I didn't choose.

21:12.534 --> 21:15.532
You think I'd choose to lose my sister?

21:15.534 --> 21:17.267
Get punched nearly to death?

21:18.567 --> 21:20.965
You reckon Henry would
risk losing everything

21:20.967 --> 21:23.068
if his patients found out?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.834
There is no choice.

21:31.233 --> 21:33.834
Yes, well... enjoy the scones.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.534
Mr. Briggs hopes the
farm will pass to you.

21:45.001 --> 21:47.965
He says that Dawn would approve.

21:47.967 --> 21:50.867
So, how can I not?

21:57.934 --> 21:59.799
Oh good.

21:59.801 --> 22:01.865
At least someone got through to her.

22:01.867 --> 22:04.565
Four verses after
fellas shouldn't smooch,

22:04.567 --> 22:07.331
that bit about dads killing
their sons for giving lip.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.132
That threw her.

22:09.134 --> 22:10.999
We'd all be dead if we stuck to that.

22:11.001 --> 22:12.265
So how's she handling it?

22:12.267 --> 22:14.632
She's headed off out to see him.

22:14.634 --> 22:17.231
I doubt it's a full
turnaround, but it's a start.

22:17.233 --> 22:18.233
Good.

22:19.367 --> 22:20.434
Now, what's with you?

22:23.734 --> 22:26.701
Doris said. Nazi?

22:30.867 --> 22:33.400
Happiness is my enemy.

22:36.801 --> 22:37.834
Right.

22:41.134 --> 22:43.331
Makes sense of
it, in an odd sort of way.

22:43.333 --> 22:44.699
So tell George.

22:44.701 --> 22:46.198
He'll understand, if I do.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.298
Give him some credit.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.331
How do you say, "You've
made my dreams come true,

22:52.333 --> 22:54.265
and that terrifies me?"

22:54.267 --> 22:56.233
Just like that.

22:56.934 --> 22:58.734
He's gotta be worried.

23:02.534 --> 23:03.634
Yes.

23:08.534 --> 23:13.534
Not sure of my timing, but
how's finances at Ash Park?

23:19.068 --> 23:20.668
The operation's
set for next week.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.068
He promises nothing.

23:23.801 --> 23:25.434
He's the top man.

23:26.267 --> 23:28.333
Even the best can't perform miracles.

23:29.634 --> 23:32.166
My offer's still open.

23:32.168 --> 23:34.166
Jack Duncan's new plan
removes any betrayal

23:34.168 --> 23:35.634
from your accepting it.

23:36.434 --> 23:38.233
I think his idea's an
interesting concept.

23:39.267 --> 23:41.166
Which will fail, but
it'll keep him around

23:41.168 --> 23:43.298
to see me through my early days.

23:43.300 --> 23:45.532
Social medicine's on the rise.

23:45.534 --> 23:47.465
He may make it work.

23:47.467 --> 23:51.331
Mm, it's ahead of its time,
in a rural setting, certainly.

23:51.333 --> 23:53.331
I'll arrive supporting the venture.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.832
It'll fall over. He'll leave.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.231
I'll be settled.

23:57.233 --> 23:58.267
And if it succeeds?

24:00.200 --> 24:03.400
Well, that's for me to judge. It won't.

24:04.701 --> 24:07.134
That stays in this room.

24:09.701 --> 24:11.665
You won't even give it a chance?

24:11.667 --> 24:15.166
Duncan's only use is to
pave my way with the locals.

24:15.168 --> 24:17.865
Whatever he makes of his
scheme can be built on by us,

24:17.867 --> 24:20.333
or not, when he's gone.

24:21.801 --> 24:24.001
I would like it to be us.

24:26.068 --> 24:27.567
The God complex.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.467
I'm sorry.

24:33.101 --> 24:35.634
I hope it wasn't as ugly
in me as it is in you.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.099
That's uncalled for.

24:39.101 --> 24:42.565
Inverness is lucky to get the skill...

24:42.567 --> 24:43.967
not the man.

24:45.300 --> 24:46.300
Shove your offer.

24:47.168 --> 24:48.734
I'll put that down to your hand.

24:51.168 --> 24:52.567
My humanity.

24:53.367 --> 24:55.834
You know, that's the
trouble with your sort.

24:57.934 --> 24:59.667
More venom than backbone.

25:11.400 --> 25:14.066
Don't add to your
woes by making trouble!

25:35.068 --> 25:37.832
- Mummy, Mummy!
- Come see! Come on!

25:37.834 --> 25:39.565
- Granny's pretty.
- Oh!

25:39.567 --> 25:42.434
- Granny looks great.
- Quick. Quick!

25:43.333 --> 25:46.233
Come on!

25:47.400 --> 25:49.465
Daddy, Daddy! She's here!

25:49.467 --> 25:50.932
I saw you out the window.

25:50.934 --> 25:52.532
Wait till you see.

25:52.534 --> 25:54.434
In you go, you two, come on.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.400
All right?

26:01.233 --> 26:02.333
No.

26:03.267 --> 26:05.467
But yes. What's going on?

26:06.734 --> 26:08.101
They've picked up on the fun of it.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.999
Close your eyes.

26:11.001 --> 26:12.701
- Oh!
- Come on.

26:14.867 --> 26:17.834
Yoo-hoo. Very good. Nearly there.

26:18.734 --> 26:20.534
Come see.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.333
Come see!

26:23.467 --> 26:25.367
And...

26:26.034 --> 26:27.101
... open.

26:28.701 --> 26:30.932
Oh, goodness!

26:30.934 --> 26:32.832
My reaction was somewhat bluer.

26:33.901 --> 26:36.298
Aunty Caro said a rude word.

26:36.300 --> 26:37.832
It was naughty.

26:37.834 --> 26:39.265
Doesn't she look fabulous?

26:39.267 --> 26:40.367
She does.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.600
A change.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.532
In more ways than one.

26:44.534 --> 26:48.400
I... I hope that I'm invited on Friday.

26:50.967 --> 26:51.967
You are.

26:53.300 --> 26:55.765
Elizabeth's getting
far too much attention.

26:55.767 --> 26:58.865
Uh, Caro's bursting to hear,

26:58.867 --> 27:03.099
but I wanted to tell you
all at once about my future.

27:03.101 --> 27:05.565
I saw Neil Burton.

27:05.567 --> 27:07.799
He's happy for me to set up a unit

27:07.801 --> 27:09.600
incorporating the women's clinic.

27:10.667 --> 27:11.767
But so much more.

27:12.634 --> 27:15.367
Men have their own problems.
They just don't face them.

27:16.801 --> 27:20.500
A community clinic for
the body and the mind.

27:21.367 --> 27:22.732
I'll get in a psychiatrist.

27:22.734 --> 27:24.765
We'll focus on men's health issues

27:24.767 --> 27:26.099
like we do with the women.

27:26.101 --> 27:28.365
Have specific men's nights.

27:28.367 --> 27:30.331
Encourage them to share.

27:30.333 --> 27:33.032
We'll do it so that both are serviced.

27:33.034 --> 27:35.665
Mine to run totally independently.

27:35.667 --> 27:37.567
Um, Neil's recommending it to the board.

27:39.001 --> 27:41.465
- Well?
- Jack, congratulations.

27:41.467 --> 27:43.231
- Thank you.
- It solves so much.

27:43.233 --> 27:44.632
I love the idea.

27:44.634 --> 27:46.398
I got it transporting Stan.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.465
Get to the man before
he does what he does

27:48.467 --> 27:50.634
or get on top of it when he does it.

27:52.034 --> 27:53.034
What do you think?

27:54.233 --> 27:55.432
Yeah?

27:55.434 --> 27:56.801
Yes.

27:59.267 --> 28:00.498
Of course!

28:01.834 --> 28:03.231
It's marvelous.

28:03.233 --> 28:04.832
It's a great idea.

28:04.834 --> 28:06.398
It's wonderful.

28:09.834 --> 28:11.298
So of course he insisted.

28:11.300 --> 28:13.298
We spent an evening at the casino.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.865
It is another world.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.265
More jewels than you
can shake a stick at.

28:17.267 --> 28:19.265
But, darling, it was
dazzling, though, wasn't it?

28:19.267 --> 28:22.665
Yes, but how many left
with them or their shirt?

28:22.667 --> 28:24.598
I bet it happens.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.999
Well, James seems concerned
about William's habits.

28:28.001 --> 28:30.198
It's a factor in expanding
the business here.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.965
What, he said that?

28:31.967 --> 28:32.967
Carolyn?

28:33.801 --> 28:35.231
Sorry.

28:35.233 --> 28:37.732
James suggested William enjoys
the tables a touch too much.

28:37.734 --> 28:40.534
Mm, it's partly behind
expanding the business here.

28:41.834 --> 28:42.899
As I said.

28:42.901 --> 28:45.298
He has never been good with money.

28:45.300 --> 28:47.365
It's worth keeping an eye on.

28:47.367 --> 28:49.500
And he's been worse at listening to me.

28:50.168 --> 28:51.999
Good thing there's no
casinos in Australia.

28:52.001 --> 28:53.532
It's bad enough with two-up.

28:53.534 --> 28:55.298
There'd be a lot more poor households.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.032
There's enough with the backroom games.

28:57.034 --> 28:58.901
Something we'll focus on at the clinic.

28:59.901 --> 29:02.166
Grog number one, of course.

29:02.168 --> 29:03.598
And some of the women are starting

29:03.600 --> 29:05.565
to rely too much on tranquilizers,

29:05.567 --> 29:08.498
so have to get the local
GPs on side with that.

29:08.500 --> 29:11.198
Might they see that
as poaching their patients?

29:11.200 --> 29:13.899
We'll take the hard cases, like
any other part of the hospital.

29:13.901 --> 29:16.198
Stella Jones managed
on nothing for months

29:16.200 --> 29:17.999
to pay off Bob's Anzac Day debts.

29:18.001 --> 29:19.632
No wonder she took to pills.

29:19.634 --> 29:21.665
Well, fix the man, maybe fix the woman.

29:21.667 --> 29:23.434
Amen to that, yes?

29:24.001 --> 29:25.400
Absolutely.

29:59.534 --> 30:00.667
Me too?

30:02.500 --> 30:04.398
I doubt Grandmother's changed enough

30:04.400 --> 30:06.168
to allow smoking at table...

30:09.567 --> 30:11.834
... even if she is staying for Shabbat.

30:14.834 --> 30:19.333
Although I haven't seen a single
finger run along a surface.

30:21.001 --> 30:22.834
A transformation.

30:25.400 --> 30:29.999
Speaking of
surfaces, it's not subtle.

30:30.001 --> 30:31.367
Yours.

30:32.534 --> 30:34.899
You're lucky Sarah's distracted,
or she'd be at you, too.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.267
I'm simply absorbing the idea.

30:40.367 --> 30:42.134
You were hoping he'd leave.

30:45.767 --> 30:47.068
You're shattered.

30:51.168 --> 30:53.001
Oh, I want to scream.

30:55.101 --> 30:56.600
You have to tell him.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.333
If I start, I won't stop.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.500
You can't pretend.

31:05.367 --> 31:07.434
How his eyes glowed.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.767
How can I douse that?

31:13.333 --> 31:17.732
His concept of moving on is
marching stolidly in place

31:17.734 --> 31:19.333
in a different uniform.

31:21.367 --> 31:22.467
You have your new job.

31:25.567 --> 31:27.901
There was a frustrating
logic to it once.

31:31.934 --> 31:33.034
But now...

31:38.267 --> 31:41.001
Why can't he at least
consider what is out there?

31:43.567 --> 31:45.200
Because he's Papa.

31:46.901 --> 31:48.166
I feel sick.

31:48.168 --> 31:50.534
It's all right, it's all
right, it's all right.

31:56.101 --> 31:58.834
For the first time, I
think we might not make it.

32:10.001 --> 32:12.865
His handing the house
back was unexpected.

32:12.867 --> 32:15.132
A lesser man might not have.

32:15.134 --> 32:18.932
Matt's greatest strength
is his greatest weakness.

32:18.934 --> 32:21.231
A rigid code of conduct.

32:21.233 --> 32:23.665
You'd no reservations in taking it?

32:23.667 --> 32:26.532
Briefly, but what he said was true.

32:26.534 --> 32:28.534
I gave it under different circumstances.

32:29.634 --> 32:31.333
Who'd have guessed at the time.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.867
At least you saw in time.

32:35.434 --> 32:36.932
Yes.

32:36.934 --> 32:38.865
I think you'll be much happier.

32:38.867 --> 32:40.168
- I will be.
- Mm.

32:41.001 --> 32:42.532
You've told George?

32:42.534 --> 32:45.231
I trust all's on the property?

32:45.233 --> 32:47.467
He would never ask you to stop working.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.801
I have to at least try the
traditional role for fit.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.168
Any reason why now?

32:55.200 --> 32:57.500
You'll understand, if anyone will.

32:59.001 --> 33:00.834
We've had some good sales.

33:02.233 --> 33:04.500
The war is always with us.

33:05.101 --> 33:07.068
What's it got to do with that?

33:11.034 --> 33:12.799
George first.

33:12.801 --> 33:14.932
Dessert, I think.

33:14.934 --> 33:16.367
I'll hurry it along.

33:21.267 --> 33:23.832
She almost sounded
like me then. Goodness.

33:23.834 --> 33:25.732
You're a role model, Mother.

33:25.734 --> 33:29.032
Oh, just as I embrace my inner self.

33:29.034 --> 33:30.665
My legacy, perhaps.

33:30.667 --> 33:33.865
I reckon we're all
turning over new leaves.

33:33.867 --> 33:34.867
I'll drink to that.

33:46.101 --> 33:47.667
Sleep tight, little man.

33:57.034 --> 33:58.467
In bed.

34:04.767 --> 34:08.934
Every time I've been happiest,
life's shattered me the most.

34:10.500 --> 34:14.068
In '37, I wrote a letter to my
mother that I'd married René.

34:15.766 --> 34:17.801
She said I was dead to her.

34:19.333 --> 34:22.701
Paris 1940, we were so in love.

34:23.233 --> 34:25.634
And the Germans marched in.

34:26.600 --> 34:30.833
You and I engaged, and
that's when they found René.

34:32.333 --> 34:36.333
At peace with that, and then he died.

34:38.701 --> 34:42.266
David born, nearly killed by Regina.

34:44.467 --> 34:45.600
And now...

34:47.634 --> 34:49.567
... I've never been happier.

34:51.233 --> 34:53.500
At my happiest, what might come?

34:56.266 --> 34:58.932
When Stan held the rifle on
me, I thought that was it.

34:58.934 --> 35:01.333
I thought I was dead, and
I thought, "That's fine."

35:03.134 --> 35:08.367
At least the curse falls
on me, not you... or David.

35:11.567 --> 35:13.500
Because it is like a curse.

35:20.534 --> 35:21.701
And now?

35:25.101 --> 35:29.500
Sister Adams was constructed
out of the rubble of war.

35:30.500 --> 35:33.365
She was in control, unflappable.

35:33.367 --> 35:35.565
That's why when I met
Elizabeth, I thought, "You...

35:35.567 --> 35:37.134
You won't get the better of me."

35:38.101 --> 35:41.767
It's why when Regina did
her worst, I managed my best.

35:42.801 --> 35:47.200
She's where I've retreated
whenever I've felt most at risk.

35:48.101 --> 35:49.667
Sister Adams.

35:50.634 --> 35:52.134
Sister Nordmann.

35:53.333 --> 35:55.101
Sister Bligh.

35:57.001 --> 35:58.634
She can't be hurt.

36:02.267 --> 36:03.932
Sarah Bligh can.

36:03.934 --> 36:07.534
It's why I've resisted becoming her.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.434
And now?

36:14.034 --> 36:16.300
Sarah Bligh is who I am.

36:18.101 --> 36:20.901
I can't know who I am beside that...

36:22.467 --> 36:24.667
... without embracing that.

36:26.034 --> 36:29.001
Embrace the expectation.

36:30.734 --> 36:33.168
Discover what's possible within it.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.331
A world of love.

36:44.333 --> 36:45.634
You.

36:47.101 --> 36:49.500
- David.
- Yourself.

36:50.867 --> 36:52.298
I'll not stand in the way of you.

36:52.300 --> 36:54.168
You never have.

36:56.168 --> 36:58.400
But I have to stop running from us.

37:00.567 --> 37:02.001
Trust us.

37:03.434 --> 37:04.734
Trust fate.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.834
No more fear.

37:12.300 --> 37:13.801
I can do it.

38:15.467 --> 38:16.600
Hello!

38:17.734 --> 38:20.598
He wanted to see new Granny
before he'd eat his breakfast.

38:20.600 --> 38:21.632
New Granny?

38:21.634 --> 38:22.965
His words, not mine.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.699
Well, here she is.

38:25.701 --> 38:26.932
You look nice.

38:26.934 --> 38:28.965
Oh, thank you, kind sir.

38:28.967 --> 38:30.498
All right, off you go. Scoot.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.598
Poppy and Georgie are waiting.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.732
You should buy new dresses, too, Mummy.

38:34.734 --> 38:36.865
Oh, I think we'll leave that to Granny.

38:36.867 --> 38:38.099
New Granny.

38:40.168 --> 38:42.265
He has a precocious sense of couture.

38:42.267 --> 38:44.032
Mm, he just loves all
the fuss around it.

38:44.034 --> 38:45.034
Mm.

38:47.600 --> 38:48.734
Shabbat.

38:49.734 --> 38:50.901
Yes?

38:53.034 --> 38:55.598
I would be thrilled if you come,

38:55.600 --> 38:57.634
but only if you're truly
comfortable with it.

38:58.834 --> 39:01.634
Well, one never knows unless one tries.

39:03.734 --> 39:05.400
Is that so amusing?

39:06.333 --> 39:08.300
It's just relevant to <i>my</i> new day.

39:10.134 --> 39:12.565
I'd like you to give me some training

39:12.567 --> 39:14.134
on how to run a household.

39:15.934 --> 39:18.400
I'm testing out new Sarah.

39:25.967 --> 39:28.231
Mr. Henry Fox on the phone, ma'am.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.066
Oh, the poor dear.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.932
James' former swain.

39:32.934 --> 39:35.465
- Father to Anna's child.
- I know.

39:35.467 --> 39:38.166
Oh, all too complicated.

39:38.168 --> 39:40.034
He's asking for Mrs. Goddard.

39:40.801 --> 39:43.932
I see. What did you tell him?

39:43.934 --> 39:45.799
That she's not available.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.634
- But not that she's away.
- No.

39:49.634 --> 39:52.699
Tell him Mrs. Goddard would be thrilled

39:52.701 --> 39:54.899
to see him here at 11:00.

39:54.901 --> 39:56.941
- But Mrs...
- A very white lie. Quick sticks.

39:57.634 --> 39:59.465
Terribly proud chap.

39:59.467 --> 40:01.132
May not come otherwise.

40:01.134 --> 40:02.999
Come for?

40:03.001 --> 40:05.565
To be restored, my dear.

40:05.567 --> 40:09.267
As you with Elizabeth, so I with him.

40:14.534 --> 40:16.294
- Thank you, Trevor.
- Sure.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.799
- Good morning.
- Morning.

40:19.801 --> 40:21.001
Be up soon.

40:24.134 --> 40:25.799
You're definitely sure?

40:25.801 --> 40:27.699
Emma's future's
more important than mine.

40:27.701 --> 40:29.865
That money's going to
put her through uni.

40:29.867 --> 40:31.532
But more to the point, are <i>you</i> sure?

40:31.534 --> 40:33.498
Last year it would have been a stretch,

40:33.500 --> 40:35.967
but this year it's
been a bumper wool crop.

40:38.534 --> 40:40.231
The farm's been your life, Roy.

40:40.233 --> 40:42.799
A man's never too old
to change, Mr. Bligh.

40:42.801 --> 40:44.899
We'll be lucky to get you.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.132
We'll pop over and see
Harry when Olivia's gone.

40:47.134 --> 40:48.365
And Missy, too?

40:48.367 --> 40:50.099
No show without Judy.

40:50.101 --> 40:51.432
I just thought with how she is...

40:51.434 --> 40:54.032
Well, nothing could keep
her out of helping you two.

40:54.034 --> 40:55.598
You're sortin' it, but...

40:55.600 --> 40:57.001
We're making a start.

41:00.267 --> 41:02.765
Good morning.
Where are you off to?

41:02.767 --> 41:04.465
I have an apology to make.

41:04.467 --> 41:06.801
I'll be back in time for Olivia.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.132
How was the ride?

41:15.134 --> 41:16.465
Just what the doctor ordered.

41:16.467 --> 41:18.267
Did I, now?

41:18.967 --> 41:20.265
Come on, I could eat a horse.

41:20.267 --> 41:22.166
Well, just as well I
didn't ride up, then.

41:22.168 --> 41:24.467
Boom-tish.

41:25.934 --> 41:28.134
Might go better second house.

41:41.901 --> 41:44.198
Ah, Mrs. Bligh.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.467
Good morning.

41:46.867 --> 41:49.099
I don't blame you.

41:49.101 --> 41:53.999
I've done my best to put
Mr. Polson's mind at ease.

41:54.001 --> 41:55.168
I'm glad.

41:56.300 --> 41:59.068
My only excuse is I wasn't myself.

42:00.200 --> 42:03.999
After Mr. O'Rourke's actions, no doubt.

42:04.001 --> 42:06.331
However, the term used was extreme.

42:06.333 --> 42:07.667
Offensive.

42:09.333 --> 42:11.333
I must have touched a nerve.

42:12.068 --> 42:13.567
Was it so?

42:14.434 --> 42:17.001
You saw such men killed?

42:18.734 --> 42:19.867
I did.

42:22.233 --> 42:25.267
I always sensed you
suffered through the war.

42:26.068 --> 42:29.233
I ask no details, but
it would explain much.

42:30.400 --> 42:34.001
But to compare me to those monsters.

42:34.667 --> 42:36.965
Uh, you are yourself again?

42:36.967 --> 42:38.099
I am.

42:38.101 --> 42:41.400
Well, that counts more than any apology.

42:42.101 --> 42:45.865
As am I... sad.

42:45.867 --> 42:49.598
I don't know. Puzzled.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.801
I doubt I'll ever understand,
but I will try my best.

42:54.500 --> 42:56.367
It's all anyone can do.

42:57.168 --> 42:58.565
Yes.

42:58.567 --> 43:01.333
Harry will likely be staying,
so discretion's important.

43:01.967 --> 43:03.899
Yes.

43:03.901 --> 43:05.567
My lips are sealed.

43:06.333 --> 43:08.565
And Mr. Fox?

43:08.567 --> 43:10.198
It's unlikely he'll return.

43:10.200 --> 43:11.567
Oh.

43:12.634 --> 43:15.099
I feel regret.

43:15.101 --> 43:18.231
Without your championing,
I suspect not so.

43:18.233 --> 43:21.901
Well, then I'm glad I was
firm, except for that word.

43:23.834 --> 43:24.967
Indeed.

43:25.534 --> 43:26.734
Indeed.

43:40.701 --> 43:41.967
Mr. Briggs!

43:45.634 --> 43:46.734
Roy.

43:48.934 --> 43:50.498
We're off soon.

43:50.500 --> 43:52.233
I've something to show you.

43:53.001 --> 43:55.298
You've heard of Jack's scheme?

43:55.300 --> 43:57.298
Yeah, Mr. Bligh said.

43:57.300 --> 44:01.498
Um, as it will be changing anyway,

44:01.500 --> 44:04.500
I've asked Jack to see this made up.

44:07.901 --> 44:10.166
I've felt rather a fraud.

44:10.168 --> 44:12.198
The spark of an idea
and some early funding

44:12.200 --> 44:14.168
hardly merits my name there.

44:15.867 --> 44:18.267
We'll never forget Mrs. Briggs.

44:19.367 --> 44:21.001
Let's ensure the future doesn't.

44:25.134 --> 44:26.734
She was a fine woman.

44:32.534 --> 44:34.667
I'll see you when I get back.

45:26.667 --> 45:30.198
Lured here under false pretenses.

45:30.200 --> 45:33.166
Alone and adrift in a big city.

45:33.168 --> 45:35.999
Anna would want me to take you in hand.

45:36.001 --> 45:37.665
No pun intended.

45:37.667 --> 45:39.398
Come on.

45:39.400 --> 45:42.101
Come on. Come inside.

45:42.667 --> 45:44.298
It should just slide over to the side.

45:44.300 --> 45:46.865
You're going to drive
us all the way there?

45:46.867 --> 45:48.032
In you get.

45:49.767 --> 45:50.901
All right?

45:52.168 --> 45:53.732
No special fuss, please.

45:53.734 --> 45:55.867
We'll be back before you know it.

45:58.300 --> 46:00.198
I'm happy just looking at you.

46:01.233 --> 46:02.765
I'm so glad I was here to see it.

46:02.767 --> 46:04.233
You travel safely.

46:05.367 --> 46:08.465
The Dawn Briggs Community Clinic.

46:08.467 --> 46:10.667
- How wonderful.
- It will be.

46:12.701 --> 46:14.099
I will give your love to James.

46:14.101 --> 46:15.767
- We'll miss you.
- We will.

46:16.734 --> 46:18.732
You make a wonderful Mrs. Bligh.

46:18.734 --> 46:19.934
Thank you.

46:22.534 --> 46:23.701
Onwards.

46:25.001 --> 46:26.398
- Georgie?
- Bye!

46:27.534 --> 46:29.532
Not in a sentimental mood.

46:29.534 --> 46:31.598
I'll let you know how the meeting goes.

46:31.600 --> 46:32.765
So glamorous.

46:32.767 --> 46:34.732
I will track down Henry.

46:34.734 --> 46:35.967
See you in a few days.

46:36.901 --> 46:38.134
I'll see you there?

46:41.500 --> 46:43.298
You use
the house as your own.

46:43.300 --> 46:44.632
Thank you.

46:44.634 --> 46:46.865
Keep an eye on her with
those Hollywood types.

46:46.867 --> 46:48.732
When should I expect you back?

46:48.734 --> 46:51.231
- I'll see how I go.
- Oh, soon as you can, yeah?

46:51.233 --> 46:52.532
Back before you know it.

46:52.534 --> 46:54.410
Bye-bye, Georgie.
- Bye, bye, bye!

46:54.434 --> 46:56.365
- New adventures.
- For all of us!

46:56.367 --> 46:57.465
- Bye!
- All right.

46:57.467 --> 46:58.767
- Bye!
- See you soon!

47:07.300 --> 47:08.432
Bye!

47:08.434 --> 47:10.134
More new adventures.

47:24.867 --> 47:26.001
Goodbye.
