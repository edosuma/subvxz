40:22.162 --> 40:22.994
How do I look?

40:23.146 --> 40:25.163
Like the sexy doctor you are.

40:25.315 --> 40:27.165
I'm not a doctor yet.
It's just orientation.

40:27.167 --> 40:29.575
Here, Mama.
For your first day.

40:29.669 --> 40:32.003
-(laughs)
-Oh, are you sure?

40:32.097 --> 40:33.504
I thought it was your favorite.

40:33.506 --> 40:34.931
You borrow for luck.

40:35.008 --> 40:36.582
(whispering)
For luck.

40:36.676 --> 40:39.102
I'm gonna need all the luck
I can get.

40:39.179 --> 40:41.253
And a hug.

40:41.347 --> 40:43.440
Okay.
You're gonna crush it.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.024
Here's hoping.

So how do the uncles

41:00.383 --> 41:02.200

41:02.294 --> 41:04.627
Hate to break it to you.
Albert doesn't do chores.

41:04.854 --> 41:06.296

41:23.540 --> 41:25.873
<i> Good morning, Evan.</i>
<i> How are you?</i>

41:26.042 --> 41:28.968
Hey, Dr. Copeland.
I'm doing good.

41:29.062 --> 41:32.046
I've actually been--
been thinking a lot

41:32.215 --> 41:33.898
about what you said
in our last session,

41:34.067 --> 41:37.827
and how I hide
my true feelings from others.

41:41.333 --> 41:43.558
I'm starting to think
you might be right.

41:43.560 --> 41:46.628
<i> DR. COPELAND:</i>
<i> Okay. Let's start there.</i>

41:49.065 --> 41:50.565
-Oh.
-What? What? What? What?

41:50.583 --> 41:52.967
I think someone wants
to say "good morning."
