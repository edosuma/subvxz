WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:04.197
- So, dear...
- What?

00:04.400 --> 00:06.118
Do you see anything you like?

00:06.400 --> 00:08.550
I don't know. What's venison?

00:08.760 --> 00:10.591
- Deer.
- What?

00:11.080 --> 00:12.877
- Deer.
- What?

00:13.760 --> 00:15.876
Deer. D-E-E-R.

00:16.079 --> 00:17.798
What? W-H-A-T.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.594
What's wrong with him?

00:22.800 --> 00:26.076
Jake, it's... It's the deer
in the forest, like... Like Bambi.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.555
Oh, cool, let's eat Bambi.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.953
Coming soon to pay-per-view.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.672
Mom, wha...? What are you doing?

00:39.320 --> 00:41.390
- Nothing.
- Oh, that's stealing.

00:42.080 --> 00:45.277
Hardly. I'm paying $ 12 for a martini.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.829
They're lucky I don't take a chair.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.557
- You're paying?
- Figure of speech, Charles.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.508
Can I take this?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.153
- No.
- Oh, come on.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.875
My precious.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.799
Put it down. We do not take things
that don't belong to us.

01:00.960 --> 01:04.236
Listen who's taking the moral
high ground, Mr. Five-Finger Discount.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.829
- What does that mean?
- It doesn't mean anything.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.709
- How do you want your venison?
- Does it come with antlers?

01:11.200 --> 01:14.829
Alan, there's no reason
your son can't learn from your mistakes.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.871
I didn't make a mistake, Mom.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.116
Unbelievable.
Twenty-five years later...

01:19.280 --> 01:21.111
...and he still denies shoplifting.

01:22.160 --> 01:25.038
Oh, I get it. Five-finger discount.
Cool.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.229
I did not shoplift, Jake.
It was a misunderstanding.

01:28.560 --> 01:29.834
Alan, please.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.235
Walking around a toy store
with your brother...

01:32.400 --> 01:34.675
...and the Silly Putty just jumped
in your pocket?

01:34.840 --> 01:36.558
Yes.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.915
Not much of a lie, Dad.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.870
Okay, everybody ready to order?

01:43.080 --> 01:45.150
Is that why you won't
let me have Silly Putty?

01:45.360 --> 01:47.271
It's a stupid, pointless toy.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.879
But why'd you steal it?

01:49.080 --> 01:52.629
I didn't. The security guard must have
planted it on me to make a bust.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.995
Oh, Alan.

01:55.160 --> 01:58.914
Who in their right mind would plant
Silly Putty on a 9-year-old boy?

01:59.200 --> 02:01.111
Who, indeed?

02:02.400 --> 02:05.597
- Hey, Jake, you ever eaten snails?
- Yeah, sure.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.438
I mean, in a restaurant.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.719
Oh, no.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.160 --> 02:24.993
- You okay?
- No. That deer didn't have antlers...

02:25.160 --> 02:27.549
...when I ate it,
but it's sure coming out that way.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.709
Well, you'll feel better tomorrow.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.990
We should sue that restaurant.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.671
Well, I'll get right on it. Come on.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.719
- Dad?
- Yeah.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.030
Did you ever steal a car?

02:42.200 --> 02:43.792
I never stole anything.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.479
It's okay. You could tell me.

02:45.640 --> 02:47.870
I already know you got a rap sheet.

02:48.520 --> 02:51.080
For the last time,
I did not take that Silly Putty.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.959
But the experience
did teach me a very important lesson.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.348
And you know what that was?

02:55.560 --> 02:58.757
If you get caught, stick to your story,
no matter how lame it is?

02:59.280 --> 03:02.636
- No, the lesson was...
- Hang on, Dad.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.313
Okay, go ahead.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.671
The lesson was...

03:06.840 --> 03:10.037
Oh, God, Jake. That's...
That's awful.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.153
Yeah, I wish I could have saved
that one for school.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.392
- You too?
- Yeah.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.513
Apparently Mom wasn't
the only parasite at dinner tonight.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.713
Hey...

03:35.880 --> 03:38.872
...how much do you remember
about the whole Silly Putty incident?

03:39.080 --> 03:41.958
Oh, gee, not too much.

03:42.840 --> 03:46.879
I recall you crying when they dragged
you into the store manager's office.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.274
Then I went and got a corn dog
and an Orange Julius.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.790
Boy, those were good.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.791
- Remember those?
- No, I mean...

03:56.960 --> 03:58.757
...did you see me take
the Silly Putty?

03:59.160 --> 04:02.630
Oh, no, no,
I was nowhere near the Silly Putty.

04:02.840 --> 04:06.515
I think I was in the doll section,
taking a peek under Barbie's dress.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.196
What a gyp that was.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.597
If Jake had been caught
shoplifting and told me the story I told...

04:12.760 --> 04:14.352
...there's no way I'd believe him.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.031
Well, let's just hope
he doesn't get caught.

04:18.240 --> 04:22.392
- Can I tell you a little secret?
- Okay.

04:22.560 --> 04:26.030
I always knew
it wasn't the security guard.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.078
Really?

04:30.800 --> 04:35.078
There's only one rational explanation
for how the Silly Putty got in my pants.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.431
And what would that be?

04:44.040 --> 04:50.479
That I actually stole it,
but my mind couldn't deal with it.

04:51.080 --> 04:54.038
So somehow, I blocked it out.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.920
The human brain, huh?
You gotta love it.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.350
That happens, right?
You do something horrible...

05:00.520 --> 05:03.557
...and wake up with no recollection?
- Oh, yeah.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.990
And yet there she is,
lying right next to you.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.075
You know, that day changed my life.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.993
I mean, ever since, I've had to be
on guard against Bad Alan.

05:14.680 --> 05:16.238
I'm sorry, "Bad Alan"?

05:17.320 --> 05:20.995
Yeah, it's... It's what I call
my potential for evildoing.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.195
- Oh, God.
- It's why I've always worked so hard...

05:24.360 --> 05:28.035
...to be a good son, a good student,
a good person.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.994
And you've succeeded.
You are good, good, good.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.633
Well, sure, I turned out great,
but at what cost?

05:36.800 --> 05:40.031
I mean, do you have any clue
how tightly wrapped I've had to be...

05:40.200 --> 05:42.794
...to keep Bad Alan in check?

05:46.160 --> 05:48.116
I get glimpses.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.708
Well, I suppose
I should count my blessings...

05:51.880 --> 05:54.519
...that I was stopped.
Who knows what kind of monster...

05:54.680 --> 05:57.478
...I would've become if I hadn't
been caught with the putty.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.555
But what if the security guard
did plant it on you?

06:01.720 --> 06:04.109
That would mean there's no Bad Alan.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.672
That's true.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.149
But I can't afford
to take that chance.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.350
None of us can.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.838
He's fine.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.232
Hey, Charlie.

06:32.840 --> 06:33.909
Hey, Rose.

06:35.240 --> 06:38.198
Looks like somebody needs
a shoulder to cry on.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.799
No, thank you.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.116
Wanna just make out then?

06:43.400 --> 06:46.915
- Rose...
- You're right. That was out of line.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.116
I deserve a spanking.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.879
Okay, what's up?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.230
- Can I trust you with something?
- You trust me...

06:56.400 --> 06:58.391
...with your bank account number.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.157
I never gave you
my bank account number.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.715
Right, right. Go on.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.037
Have you ever done anything
so wrong, so horrible...?

07:08.240 --> 07:10.310
Oh, yeah.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.190
- Let me finish.
- I'm sorry.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.510
Something that seemed
harmless at the time...

07:15.680 --> 07:18.672
...yet somehow managed
to mess up someone's entire life?

07:19.320 --> 07:21.072
Good question.

07:21.240 --> 07:25.074
I think it's too early to say. Go on.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.153
Well, I have.

07:27.320 --> 07:30.596
Twenty-five years ago,
I put Silly Putty in my brother's pants.

07:30.800 --> 07:34.349
Well, if you left it in the egg,
it should still be good.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.439
My point is,
everybody thought he stole it...

07:38.640 --> 07:40.517
...and I never told him the truth.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.233
Now you're wracked with guilt...

07:42.400 --> 07:45.710
...and not sure whether a confession
will make things better or worse.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.632
Yes, exactly.

07:48.240 --> 07:50.754
That's a sexy feeling, isn't it?

07:51.480 --> 07:53.072
Come on, Rose.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.639
You want my advice, Charlie?

07:54.840 --> 07:56.512
God help me, yes.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.756
Take your secret to the grave...

07:58.920 --> 08:01.753
...but leave a manuscript explaining
every questionable act...

08:01.920 --> 08:04.115
...you've committed
in a safety-deposit box...

08:04.320 --> 08:06.993
...with instructions for it to be opened
at your death...

08:07.160 --> 08:10.994
...and read in front of all your friends,
relatives and former lovers.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.871
I like it.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.679
Good.

08:17.520 --> 08:20.796
Now we can relax
and enjoy the evening.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.075
Sing it with me, Charlie.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.034
Three, four, five, six, seven.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.553
- Are you decent?
- Yeah.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.915
Three, four, five, six, seven.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.833
What's up?

08:53.520 --> 08:57.638
- Nothing. Just came in to say good night.
- Three, four, five, six, seven.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.635
Why?

09:00.800 --> 09:03.234
Three, four, five, six, seven.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.277
Nothing. You just seemed stressed out
before, and I was concerned.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.119
Oh, thanks. You're a...
You're a good brother.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.714
Three, four, five, six, seven.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.994
You do that every night?

09:16.160 --> 09:17.878
Are you kidding? After every meal.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.349
Three, four, five, six, seven.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.194
You are tightly wrapped, aren't you?

09:23.400 --> 09:26.472
The price of healthy gums
is eternal vigilance.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.553
Oh, God, I can't do this anymore.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.678
- Do what?
- I have to tell you something.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.669
- Okay.
- Come on out in the bedroom.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.432
All right.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.315
- What you doing?
- You'll understand in a minute.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.438
- I thought you had to tell me something.
- I do.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.639
There is no Bad Alan.

09:54.800 --> 09:55.994
I stole the Silly Putty...

09:56.160 --> 09:58.594
...and put it in your pocket
when you weren't looking.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.799
- Three, four, five, six, seven.
- Damn you to hell!

10:03.280 --> 10:05.635
Come out here and die like a man!

10:06.160 --> 10:09.675
What do you know,
there is a Bad Alan.

10:12.840 --> 10:16.276
Hey, Dad, when you got arrested
for shoplifting, did they take you to jail?

10:17.360 --> 10:20.750
I did not get arrested,
and there was no jail.

10:20.960 --> 10:24.396
So I guess you never had to shank a guy
to get your props in the yard.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.919
You cracked the parental code
on the cable box again.

10:29.400 --> 10:33.109
It's 1-2-3-4.
A monkey could crack that.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.638
- Good morning.
- Morning.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.233
Why are you walking like that?

10:42.440 --> 10:45.193
I spent the night in the bathroom.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.670
You too, huh?

10:50.800 --> 10:52.836
Tell Jake what you told me
last night.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.991
Oh, okay. Sure.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.754
Jake, your father didn't steal
the Silly Putty.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.876
- I did.
- Really?

11:01.080 --> 11:03.833
Yeah, I stuck it in his pocket,
so if anything happened...

11:04.000 --> 11:06.275
...he'd be the one to get in trouble.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.072
What do you think now, Jake?

11:09.240 --> 11:11.356
I think Uncle Charlie's a genius.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.435
What? No, no. No genius. No, no.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.633
I mean, it's the perfect crime.
How did you think of that?

11:18.320 --> 11:19.594
I don't know.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.514
I saw the putty. Your dad was wearing
those dorky chinos with the big pockets.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.558
- And a light just went off in my head...
- Charlie.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.273
A bad light. A bad, evil light.
Because stealing is wrong...

11:31.440 --> 11:34.238
...and letting somebody else
take the blame for it is worse.

11:34.440 --> 11:37.113
Yeah, so Dad was like a decoy.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.150
Well, technically, the term is "mule."

11:41.360 --> 11:44.796
- Mule? Why?
- Because he carries stuff.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.672
- Oh, of course...
- Okay, okay.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.752
The important thing is,
your father never stole in his life.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.150
And your Uncle Charlie
is a thief and a coward.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.555
Yeah, but you're a mule.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.949
Are you happy?
Go get dressed and washed.

12:01.160 --> 12:04.470
- Can we go to the mall?
- Why do you wa...? No.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.909
I need to get a different mule.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.595
Okay, can we please get past this?

12:11.800 --> 12:13.233
No. No, we can't.

12:13.400 --> 12:18.269
I feel betrayed and hurt
in ways that I can't even express.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.510
And you think we can
just dance past that?

12:20.720 --> 12:22.597
I was hoping.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.836
Well, I am sorry,
but it is not that easy.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.232
I mean, thanks to you, my... My life
has been twisted beyond recognition.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.516
I mean, look at me, Charlie.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.558
I'm a... I'm a broke, hopelessly neurotic,
middle-aged man...

12:34.720 --> 12:36.995
...who doesn't know who he is
or where he belongs.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.559
I have nothing, Charlie.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.554
- No... No wife, no home, nothing.
- Okay.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.110
So should I check back with you
after lunch?

12:51.440 --> 12:52.634
What do you want me to do?

12:52.800 --> 12:55.268
I said I was sorry.
L... I confessed to Jake.

12:55.440 --> 12:59.115
And I doubt I got more than six,
seven hours sleep last night.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.396
Nothing you can do.
The damage has been done.

13:01.560 --> 13:04.313
- It can't be undone.
- Come on, I'm your brother.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.512
- You're gonna forgive. You always do.
- No, no, this is different.

13:07.680 --> 13:11.150
- This is the worst thing you've ever done.
- No, it's not.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.239
What do you mean?

13:16.120 --> 13:19.476
Just making conversation.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.593
- Hey, Mom.
- Charlie, what are you doing here?

13:25.800 --> 13:29.713
- In the neighborhood. Thought I'd visit.
- Why?

13:31.600 --> 13:34.876
- I don't know. I'm your son.
- And...?

13:35.640 --> 13:38.871
- And I was hoping we could talk.
- About?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.872
May I please just come in?

13:43.080 --> 13:45.469
Are you fleeing from the law?

13:46.400 --> 13:49.312
- I'm not fleeing from anyone, Mom.
- Well, keep it in mind.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.756
No one would ever think
to look for you at your mother's house.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.716
- I get your point. I don't visit enough.
- You don't visit at all.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.953
And I'm riddled with guilt.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.669
Oh, you're just saying that
to make me feel better.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.397
So, what's up?

14:06.560 --> 14:08.437
You know how the other night
at dinner...

14:08.600 --> 14:10.670
...we were talking about
the Silly Putty deal?

14:11.520 --> 14:14.114
Did that venison disagree with you?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.791
Yeah, that's not
what I came to talk about.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.352
I've got a good mind
to sue that restaurant.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.036
- Yeah, anyway, about the Silly Putty...
- What about it?

14:26.200 --> 14:28.634
Alan didn't steal it. I did.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.150
I put it in his pocket.

14:32.360 --> 14:35.670
You framed your baby brother?

14:37.480 --> 14:39.072
How could you?

14:39.280 --> 14:41.316
I know, I know.
It was a rotten thing to do.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.990
Rotten? It's unspeakable.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.632
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

14:50.560 --> 14:52.915
- You?
- First the embarrassment...

14:53.080 --> 14:56.231
...of people thinking
that I'd spawned a petty thief.

14:56.440 --> 15:00.513
Then all the trouble I went to
trying to figure out clever ways...

15:00.680 --> 15:03.558
...to hide my jewelry
from his sticky little fingers.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.877
- That's really not what l...
- Not to mention the hundreds of hours...

15:07.040 --> 15:10.271
...spent driving him to therapy
with that creepy Dr. Demerest...

15:10.440 --> 15:16.072
...while I could have been...
I don't know, doing something fun.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.395
Okay, yeah,
it was a real imposition on you...

15:19.560 --> 15:23.314
...and as it turns out, it had
kind of a negative impact on Alan too.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.080
Alan? Oh, yes, of course.

15:27.880 --> 15:31.873
You know, there was no insurance
for kleptomania therapy in those days.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.600
It was all out of pocket.

15:35.960 --> 15:39.111
Yeah, but about Alan...

15:39.280 --> 15:42.909
...I was hoping you might have insight
as to how I could get him to forgive me.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.639
Why ask me?

15:45.520 --> 15:48.717
You know,
I'm starting to wonder that myself.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.311
I guess it's because he still loves you...

15:51.480 --> 15:54.153
...despite all the lousy stuff
you did to him.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.831
I beg your pardon?
I was a wonderful mother.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.513
And if Alan thinks otherwise...

15:59.680 --> 16:04.674
...it's only because that walleyed
Dr. Demerest put ideas into his head.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.838
Well, that was money well spent.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.033
Okay, then.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.909
I didn't need a reason to drink tonight,
but it's nice to know I've got one.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.711
Hey, Charlie, wait.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.196
- What?
- Have you forgotten why you came here?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.033
You want forgiveness, right?

16:22.960 --> 16:25.997
- Yes.
- Well...

16:26.160 --> 16:28.037
...I forgive you.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.795
But next time, call first.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.514
Would you pass the salt?

16:53.280 --> 16:54.554
Could you get me the salt?

16:55.800 --> 16:58.394
- Dad, salt.
- Sure.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.238
- Here.
- Thanks.

17:03.040 --> 17:05.395
Oh, would you give me
the ketchup, please?

17:05.599 --> 17:07.954
Here. Here's the ketchup.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.398
Thank you.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.993
- Dad?
- Yeah.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.714
If Uncle Charlie
let you kick him in the nuts...

17:19.880 --> 17:21.438
...would that make you guys even?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.273
No.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.190
Boy, he's really mad at you.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.753
Relax, Jake. We're just having
a little communication problem.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.669
That's what Dad said
right before Mom threw him out.

17:32.840 --> 17:33.909
Nobody threw me out.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.958
Your mother and I mutually decided
that we weren't compatible.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.720
You don't seem compatible
with Uncle Charlie right now.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.718
- Well, it's not my fault.
- Was it your fault with Mom?

17:43.520 --> 17:45.033
No.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.590
You know, Dad, maybe you're
the one who's not compatible.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.236
If you're done with dinner,
do your homework.

17:54.680 --> 17:58.070
Fine, kill the messenger.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.635
- Oh, come on, Alan. Talk to me.
- No.

18:03.040 --> 18:06.589
Look, I wanna make this right,
but you gotta help me.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.718
Please, tell me what I can do.
I'm begging for your forgiveness.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.558
I am sorry,
but you did something...

18:11.720 --> 18:15.759
...which affected my life
in a deeply destructive way and...

18:15.920 --> 18:18.150
l... I don't think I have it in me
to forgive you.

18:18.760 --> 18:22.150
- Hello? Anybody home?
- In here, Mom.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.678
Well, how are my boys
doing this evening?

18:31.720 --> 18:35.838
Well, I think Mommy
has the answer. Alan...

18:36.000 --> 18:38.719
...if you find it intolerable
living under the same roof...

18:38.880 --> 18:40.677
...with the brother
who betrayed you...

18:43.280 --> 18:46.511
...then you and Jake
can come and live with me.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.878
We're good.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.829
Hey, Charlie, a couple of days ago...

19:01.000 --> 19:04.231
...you said the Silly Putty wasn't
the worst thing you ever did to me.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.438
It's ancient history. Let it go.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.279
I know, I know.
It's just... I'm curious.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.000
What else have you done to me
that I didn't know about?

19:13.160 --> 19:14.878
- It's not important.
- Yes, it is.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.031
The truth about
the shoplifting incident...

19:17.200 --> 19:19.191
...it's allowed me
to reevaluate who I am...

19:19.360 --> 19:21.271
...and... And feel better about myself.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.233
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.470
I feel a lot better since I confessed.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.551
Good, good.
So let's keep going with this.

19:28.560 --> 19:32.075
Okay, but you gotta promise that
no matter what I tell you, all is forgiven.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.430
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.196
You're probably gonna laugh.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.710
- I'm sure I will. Tell me.
- Well...

19:41.040 --> 19:43.474
...remember how you were
a bed wetter till you were 8?

19:43.880 --> 19:45.279
Yeah.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.153
You actually stopped at 6.

19:52.840 --> 19:56.594
Wha...? What...? What did you do?
Did you sneak into my room and...?

19:56.760 --> 19:59.149
And...? And pour warm water on me
while I was asleep?

20:00.280 --> 20:04.398
Yeah, okay, let's say it was water,
and let's say I poured it.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.434
Well, I feel better. How about you?
