10:23.535 --> 10:24.798
took everybody.

10:24.841 --> 10:27.017
To sell into the spek mines,
no doubt.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.237
So how do you know English?

10:29.280 --> 10:32.066
-Is... that relevant?
-Yeah, Lana.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.807
I mean, why does anybody
know it?

10:33.850 --> 10:35.809
I mean she does.
She's obviously not human.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.550
-But not so obviously a she.
-Hey!

10:38.594 --> 10:39.726
We were all thinking it.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.728
'Cause you're all
a bunch of xenophobes.

10:41.771 --> 10:44.339
Are you...
You're as bad as she is.

10:44.382 --> 10:46.733
-Always calling me fish or...
-That doesn't count.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.866
-You're a robot.
-Synthetic human.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.520
Potato, pobobot, am I right?

10:51.563 --> 10:54.305
Anyway, the important thing
is I'm okay.

10:54.349 --> 10:55.698
-Is that so?
-Well, yeah.

10:55.742 --> 10:58.222
I mean, I'm heir to the throne
of the House of Garj, so...

11:00.311 --> 11:01.965
And that's actually
a pretty huge deal.

11:02.009 --> 11:04.098
-Well, li-like, how huge?
-Well...

11:04.141 --> 11:06.404
I-If you had to express it
monetarily.

11:06.448 --> 11:08.972
-Wh... Oh, no.
-Lana, shut up.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.582
-Archer, shut up.
-[all clamor]
-No!

11:10.626 --> 11:12.976
-We are not going off on some...-Wild goose chase! Who's in?

11:13.020 --> 11:14.804
-I'm so in!-Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me!-Ooh, me!

11:14.848 --> 11:18.547
-No. Now, wait a minute.
-Lana, democracy has spoken.

11:18.590 --> 11:21.332
So, if we take you home
to Garj...

11:21.376 --> 11:22.986
Well, to Garjek, our moon,

11:23.030 --> 11:25.815
then my parents
will reward you handsomely.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.991
I'm already handsome.
How much?

11:28.035 --> 11:29.993
I mean...
easily a million credits.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.996
-[excited chatter]
-In this economy?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.998
And like I said,
I'm a pretty huge deal.

11:35.042 --> 11:37.000
Yes, yes, you definitely are.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.350
So, can somebody here please

11:39.394 --> 11:42.005
get His Highness
some more cereal right now?

11:42.049 --> 11:43.746
Yeah, or maybe
just better cereal?

11:43.790 --> 11:45.879
Well, I don't know
about all that.

11:45.922 --> 11:46.923
Just a thought.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.360
Can I talk to you... please?

11:49.404 --> 11:52.624
If you can do it while I'm
plotting a course for Garjek.

11:52.668 --> 11:53.800
Wha...

11:53.843 --> 11:55.192
And ignoring you.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.979
LANA:
Because we need to put
the ship in dry-dock.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.415
The hull was damaged,

12:00.458 --> 12:02.983
-even before this fiasco.
-ARCHER: All right,

12:03.026 --> 12:04.114
carry the two...

12:04.158 --> 12:06.421
And now you want to put more
stress on the ship

12:06.464 --> 12:08.336
and jump two systems away

12:08.379 --> 12:11.818
just because a sentient blobsays there might be money in it.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.645
Uncarry the two.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.691
On top of which--
not that you give a shit--

12:15.735 --> 12:17.911
but you swore to me
we'd go back to Earth.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.129
-You promised.
-Lana, come on.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.870
I promised you lots of things.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.350
-Archer...
-Besides,

12:22.393 --> 12:24.569
like you said,
it's just two systems, a...

12:24.613 --> 12:25.832
a skip and a jump.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.659
What could possibly go wrong?

12:27.703 --> 12:28.922
-Seriously?
-[chuckles]

12:28.965 --> 12:30.140
Besides all the normal stuff

12:30.184 --> 12:32.839
that could easily
go disastrously wrong,

12:32.882 --> 12:35.842
-since space travel
is so dangerous.
-Ugh.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.279
[engine whirring]

12:38.322 --> 12:40.803
ARCHER:
[laughs] Woooooo!!

12:40.847 --> 12:43.980
Hyperspace!

12:56.645 --> 12:59.039
ARCHER [laughing]:
Oh, m... oh, man.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.997
Is hyperspace not the best?

13:01.041 --> 13:03.870
If you mean is it the bestat putting stress on the hull...

13:03.913 --> 13:05.741
Is this
the rest of my life now--

13:05.785 --> 13:08.309
you bitching
about the damn hull?

13:08.352 --> 13:10.528
Right? Relax.
The hull's gonna be...

13:10.572 --> 13:11.660
-[explosion]
-Aah!

13:11.703 --> 13:12.748
-What the hell was that?
-[glass shatters]

13:12.792 --> 13:15.098
My last bottle of bitter lemon!

13:15.142 --> 13:16.230
Dri'n fighters inbound.

13:16.273 --> 13:17.840
ARCHER:
From where?

13:17.884 --> 13:19.407
-LANA: From the transport.
-ARCHER: What?!

13:19.450 --> 13:21.626
LANA:
They must've
followed us, dumbass.

13:21.670 --> 13:22.845
How am I a dumbass?

13:22.889 --> 13:24.716
How much time do you have?

13:24.760 --> 13:25.892
Ow!

13:25.935 --> 13:27.894
Uh... not much.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.070
-COMPUTER: Hull damage.
-We know!

13:30.113 --> 13:31.549
-[alarm blaring]
-COMPUTER: Battle stations.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.856
Ugh! What now?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.858
Seriously.

13:35.902 --> 13:39.122
But whatever it is,
I'm sure it's Archer's fault.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.036
-Krieger, helm!
-Yep!

13:40.080 --> 13:43.648
Okay, assholes.
Sun's out, guns out.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.520
Well, in space,
the sun is always...

13:45.563 --> 13:47.957
Don't step on my line, fish!

13:57.401 --> 13:58.489
Whoa...

13:59.926 --> 14:01.318
Uh, I thought this was
a civilian ship.

14:01.362 --> 14:02.885
Isn't it illegal
for it to have weapons?

14:02.929 --> 14:04.669
Oh, my God, it is.

14:04.713 --> 14:07.716
Should we pull over and
call the Federation, or, uh...

14:07.759 --> 14:09.892
-What? No, I just...
-'Cause we're happy
to pull over, Bort!

14:09.936 --> 14:12.286
-KRIEGER: S-seriously?
-LANA: No. Archer...

14:12.329 --> 14:13.504
-[loud thud]
-Please!

14:13.548 --> 14:15.419
Quit dicking around.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.857
ARCHER:
Yeah, Bort.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.079
Come on, come on,
come on, come on...

14:23.123 --> 14:24.559
Yes!

14:27.605 --> 14:29.825
Get some! Get some!

14:30.957 --> 14:34.351
Suppressing fire!

14:35.396 --> 14:36.353
ARCHER:
Jesus,

14:36.397 --> 14:37.920
you couldn't suppress a cough.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.183
-CYRIL [over comms]:
Yes, I could.
-Touché, Cyril.

14:42.229 --> 14:44.144
We're taking too much damage!

14:44.187 --> 14:46.842
Damn it!
Okay, Carol...

14:46.886 --> 14:48.931
Carol?
Carol!

14:48.975 --> 14:50.411
-What?
-ARCHER: You know what!

14:50.454 --> 14:52.979
-Ugh!
-LANA: Goddamn it, woman.

14:53.022 --> 14:55.024
All right, already!

14:56.678 --> 14:57.897
Jesus!

14:59.028 --> 15:00.987
[weapons firing]

15:08.168 --> 15:10.822
Isn't it kind of weird
Carol hates doing

15:10.866 --> 15:12.346
the one thing she's good at?

15:12.389 --> 15:14.652
No, I get it. I mean,
I'm like that with blowjobs.

15:14.696 --> 15:17.655
-MALORY: Oh, for...
-[laughing]: Wai-Wait, what?

15:17.699 --> 15:20.397
-Yeah, whooda what?
-ARCHER: Since when
are you good at blowjobs?

15:20.441 --> 15:21.746
Excuse me?

15:21.790 --> 15:23.574
[chuckles]
For your information...

15:23.618 --> 15:25.011
LANA:
Cyril, shut up.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.187
-Let the man speak.
-ARCHER: Yeah, Lana.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.232
He has nothing to say
on the matter.

15:29.276 --> 15:32.235
-Do you, Cyril?
-I... No, I guess not.

15:32.279 --> 15:34.107
ARCHER:
Whoa, w-whoa, w...
wait a minute.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.848
LANA:
Hey, look over there--
that was the last pirate.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.198
Way to go, Carol.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.851
Yeah. Yay me.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.462
ARCHER:
Okay, we will
talk about this later.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.768
-LANA: No, we won't.
-ARCHER: But for now,
head to the gig.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.118
We leave for the surface
in five.

15:45.161 --> 15:48.077
Time to see what
a million credits looks like.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.428
And we should
take a duffel bag, or...

15:51.472 --> 15:54.214
-Ray, uh, what are you doing?
-[footsteps approaching]

15:54.257 --> 15:56.346
I thought I'd go down with
y'all and see if I could,

15:56.390 --> 15:58.261
you know, find some clientele.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.307
[all laughing]

16:01.699 --> 16:04.006
Hey, you know what?

16:04.050 --> 16:05.921
I don't need it!

16:07.705 --> 16:10.012
PAM:
Aw, man. Now I feel
kind of bad.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.796
ARCHER:
Yeah, I d...

16:11.840 --> 16:13.885
I do too. Let's bring him
something back.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.800
Does he still collect
those little spoons?

16:15.844 --> 16:17.280
Ugh, yes.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.456
Hey, we're not going down
there for a shopping spree.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.806
We're gonna use that reward
money to repair the ship.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.113
Jesus, calm down,
it's just a spoon.

16:24.157 --> 16:25.201
Yeah, Lana.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.644
So, Bort, wh... uh,
what do we call your folks?

16:33.688 --> 16:35.298
BORT:
Do what?

16:35.342 --> 16:37.866
ARCHER:
Like, is this a "Your Majesty"
type deal, or...

16:37.909 --> 16:40.086
Uh, y-yeah, I guess.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.391
Okay, so...

16:41.435 --> 16:42.958
Oh, should I curtsy?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.873
Ugh, there's a picture.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.875
PAM:
First of all, I was voted

16:46.918 --> 16:49.312
Most Ladylike in my
cotillion class, and I also...

16:49.356 --> 16:51.836
Who was your competition--
a boulder?

16:51.880 --> 16:53.229
-[weapons cocking]
-[all gasp]
-Oh, the Dri'n.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.188

-ARCHER: What the...

16:55.231 --> 16:57.668
-BARRY: Hey, gang.
-Wha...

16:57.712 --> 16:59.235
Barry Six?!

16:59.279 --> 17:01.194
-MALORY: Good God.
-CYRIL: Not Barry Six.
-[all groan]

17:01.237 --> 17:04.980
Yeah, it's good ol' Barry Six.
Say, Bort.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.155
-Goddamn it, Bort.
-Hey, Six.
-You know him?

17:06.199 --> 17:07.678
How the hell do you know Bort?

17:07.722 --> 17:09.289
Oh, Bort and I go way back.

17:09.332 --> 17:12.118
I got Bort out of a sticky
little mess on Vega Three,

17:12.161 --> 17:14.294
-didn't I, bud?
-Yeah.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.078
So this was all
a big set-up?

17:16.122 --> 17:19.212
-Duh-hoy.
-I'm super sorry, you guys.

17:19.255 --> 17:20.648
Oh, you will be, you little...

17:20.691 --> 17:23.085
Butt-plug looking piece
of shit!

17:23.129 --> 17:24.869
That's what he reminds me of!

17:24.913 --> 17:26.175
Mother, please.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.176
Well look at him.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.222
So are we... cool?

17:29.265 --> 17:31.093
[chortling]

17:31.137 --> 17:32.790
I mean, I am.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.315
Okay, well,
then I'm just gonna...

17:35.358 --> 17:39.188
[grunting]
kinda...

17:39.232 --> 17:41.060
tip... just tip on out, then.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.672
BARRY [chuckling]: Wow.

17:44.715 --> 17:48.371
Wow. Look at that.
Little kook.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.504
You believe he's heir to the
throne of the House of Garj?

17:50.547 --> 17:52.201
What do you want with us?

17:52.245 --> 17:53.985
Well, me and Archer
have what you might call

17:54.029 --> 17:56.118
an outstanding account
to settle.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.686
So, for starters,
I'm gonna extract

17:58.729 --> 18:00.166
all the bones from his body.

18:00.209 --> 18:01.776
-What?!
-No biggie.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.125
Well, now just hold on a minute!

18:03.169 --> 18:04.257
-Yeah!
-If this is between

18:04.300 --> 18:06.172
the two of you,
the rest of us...

18:06.215 --> 18:08.739
-No!
-The rest of you, I hope,

18:08.783 --> 18:10.785
are gonna fetch me
a pretty good price

18:10.828 --> 18:12.178
when I sell you down
the spek mines.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.701
-Seriously?
-[overlapping chatter]

18:13.744 --> 18:15.833
Yeah. Not great, huh?

18:15.877 --> 18:17.052
[Dri'n laughing]

18:17.096 --> 18:18.097
[door slams]

18:28.019 --> 18:30.761
How about now-- happy now?

18:30.805 --> 18:33.199
I mean... probably happier
than I'm gonna be

18:33.242 --> 18:35.418
when Barry Six
starts yanking my bones.
