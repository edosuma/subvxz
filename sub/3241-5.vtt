<i>Previously...</i>

00:04.588 --> 00:06.886
<i>I'd seemed to have fallen through time.</i>

00:07.132 --> 00:08.850
The village has been humming
with talk of ye

00:08.926 --> 00:10.348
since you came to the castle.

00:10.427 --> 00:11.849
<i>What is it they're saying about me?</i>

00:11.929 --> 00:14.432
I suspect you may be an English spy.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.392
I'll have you watched day and night.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.690
<i>Redcoats wanted to send a message.</i>

00:19.436 --> 00:20.653
This is what you get

00:20.771 --> 00:22.569
when you fight back
against the English.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.445
<i>She came back through the stones?</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:26.113
Aye, she did. They always do.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.446
<i>I need to leave this place.</i>

00:29.363 --> 00:30.956
<i>You need not be scared of me</i>

00:31.073 --> 00:33.451
nor anyone else here
as long as I'm with ye.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.619
I'm leaving tomorrow,
and I'm taking you with me.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.211
But why me?

00:37.287 --> 00:40.382
<i>I think it would be wise
to have a healer along.</i>

00:40.874 --> 00:43.377
<i>Another chance
to go home presented itself,</i>

00:43.460 --> 00:46.509
<i>knowing this time, I must not fail.</i>

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000

He's one of my favorites.

Away an bile yer heids!

03:05.435 --> 03:07.529
What is it they're
shouting over there?

03:10.607 --> 03:12.450
I'm sorry. I don't have any Gaelic.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.412
Well, my lady,
they're teasing young Willie.

03:15.487 --> 03:18.161
It's his first time
on the road with us.

03:19.616 --> 03:23.587
And they're encouraging him
to have biblical relations...

03:25.747 --> 03:26.794
With his sister.

03:29.668 --> 03:30.715
Lovely.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.855
Come away.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.318
You're Ned Gowan, aren't you?
The lawyer?

03:46.476 --> 03:47.898
Indeed.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.155
I've see you at the hall.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.572
I'm Claire.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.696
Well, I'm very pleased
to meet you, Claire.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.904
I've just come along
to help Dougal with the records

03:56.987 --> 03:59.035
and the receipts, you know.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.664
I'm the only one
he'll trust with the money.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.163
This is lovely.

04:06.830 --> 04:10.175
- Is that goose feather?
- Well, it's swan, actually.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.131
Tools of the trade, you see.

04:12.335 --> 04:16.180
And that bag
is for the lairds rents.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.305
It comes in turners and bawbees,
small coins.

04:19.384 --> 04:22.763
But we also get bags
of grain and cabbages.

04:22.846 --> 04:26.476
And fowl suitably trussed,
I've got no argument with,

04:26.558 --> 04:30.153
even goats, although one of them
ate my handkerchief last year.

04:30.937 --> 04:34.032
But I have given
explicit instructions this year...

04:34.691 --> 04:35.908
That...

04:36.526 --> 04:40.281
That we will not accept live pigs.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.706
I don't like the sound of that cough.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.755
Well, I get fair puckled
this stretch of the road.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.123
It happens every year...

04:49.456 --> 04:50.708
The same season.

04:50.874 --> 04:54.219
Something in the wind
sets my lungs afire.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.756
I think I may be able to help you.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.716
Do you have a pipe I could borrow?

05:00.050 --> 05:01.393
AVE, a pipe.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.639
You'd have me smoke
a pipe for a cough?

05:05.722 --> 05:07.850
It's something of a paradox.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.768
You'll see.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.397
Aye.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.026
There you are.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.702
It's thorn apple.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.576
Thorn apple, aye.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.126
- Take that.
- Okay.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.584
Thorn apple you say.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.256
Is that an English thing?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.501
<i>Also known as Jimsonweed.</i>

05:34.918 --> 05:36.170
<i>The herb had medicinal properties</i>

05:36.253 --> 05:38.381
<i>that would relieve
the symptoms of asthma.</i>

05:53.603 --> 05:55.105
- Well...
- How's that?

05:55.939 --> 05:57.407
That's remarkable.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.111
Aye, pack up. We're leaving.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.187
I'm curious, Mr. Gowan,

06:31.266 --> 06:34.270
what possessed a man
of your qualifications

06:34.352 --> 06:36.605
to take up a post
in these remote Highlands.

06:37.147 --> 06:42.074
Well, as a young man, I studied law
at the University of Edinburgh.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.070
I had a small practice

06:44.988 --> 06:46.865
with lace curtains in the window,

06:46.948 --> 06:50.498
shiny brass plate
with my name on it on the door.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.578
That sounds charming.

06:51.661 --> 06:52.878
It was. It was.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.173
But I grew restless.

06:55.999 --> 06:59.754
I must confess to having
something of a taste for adventure.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.214
So I determined the best course

07:02.297 --> 07:05.346
was to head off northwards,
up here into the Highlands.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.265
And I thought that
I might induce some clan chief

07:08.345 --> 07:09.722
to allow me to serve him.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.021
Colum MacKenzie, I take it.

07:11.097 --> 07:15.022
No, no, no, no, no.
His father, Jacob. No.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.354
I'm much older than I appear, lassie.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.484
But, of course,
things were much less civilized then.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.656
Back then, when men were men

07:23.735 --> 07:26.409
and the pernicious weed
of civilization

07:26.529 --> 07:28.406
was less rampant upon the wild,

07:28.490 --> 07:30.709
bonny face of this land.

07:32.035 --> 07:36.461
You may be a man of the law, sir,
but you've the soul of a romantic.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.338
<i>Although this
newfound kinship with Ned</i>

07:43.421 --> 07:46.049
<i>would make life on the mad
more tolerable,</i>

07:46.174 --> 07:49.144
<i>I could not allow it
to distract me from my quest</i>

07:49.219 --> 07:51.768
<i>to get back to the
standing stones at Craigh na Dun</i>

07:51.846 --> 07:54.395
<i>and return to my own
20th century life.</i>

08:09.030 --> 08:10.407
Old granny...

08:13.201 --> 08:15.329
So old Granny Mary...

08:15.412 --> 08:17.335
Old Granny Mary's
getting ready for bed,

08:17.414 --> 08:18.916
and she says to her husband,

08:18.999 --> 08:20.751
"When you first saw me naked,

08:20.834 --> 08:22.302
"what were you thinking?"

08:22.377 --> 08:26.427
And he says,
"I wanted to suck your paps dry.

08:26.756 --> 08:30.135
"I wanted to swive you
until you were a worn-out husk."

08:30.427 --> 08:31.644
And she says to him,

08:31.720 --> 08:33.597
"And what are you thinking now?"

08:33.888 --> 08:35.561
And he looks at her and says,

08:35.640 --> 08:37.734
"Looks like I've done a fine job."

09:02.959 --> 09:05.712
<i>I wasn't offended
by the lewdness of their jokes</i>

09:05.795 --> 09:07.968
<i>or squeamish over the fact
that my dinner looked like</i>

09:08.048 --> 09:09.891
<i>a shriveled Easter rabbit,</i>

09:09.966 --> 09:12.890
<i>nor was I too dainty
to sleep on a pillow made of stone.</i>

09:19.100 --> 09:23.196
<i>What troubled me was that they were
clearly using Gaelic to exclude me.</i>

09:28.818 --> 09:32.038
<i>I just had to remember
my time with them would be over soon.</i>

09:32.530 --> 09:34.953
<i>Being on the road
was my chance to escape.</i>

09:45.335 --> 09:47.303
Dinna worry
what they're saying, lass.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.180
They hate me.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.674
They don't trust you.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.601
Well...

09:55.470 --> 09:58.770
Maybe Angus hates you,
but he hates everyone.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.898
What about you?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.113
Do you think I'm a spy
for the British?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.360
No.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.029
But I do think there are
things you're not telling us,

10:10.360 --> 10:13.204
and I know you tried to run
during the gathering.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.326
It's on your mind still,
plain and clear.

10:20.787 --> 10:21.913
It's been a long day.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.754
You did ask.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.078
Alastair!

10:54.445 --> 10:57.198
I hear you and the wife
have another one on the way.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.829
You're a beast of a man.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.501
I'm a MacKenzie, ye ken.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.707
- And how was the harvest?
- Very good.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.962
I bring two bags of grain,
six shilling.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.384
Fine, six shillings.

11:08.459 --> 11:11.679
That's two bags of grain
and six shillings.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.053
- Trust we'll see you tonight?
- Aye, of course.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.426
Good man.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.184
And it'll be your usual, then...

11:20.763 --> 11:22.561
Eggs' cabbage and...

11:28.605 --> 11:30.152
And who do we have here?

11:30.773 --> 11:33.117
- You couldn't be Beathan's boy.
- Aye.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.116
Well, time lets the truth slip,
ye ken.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.073
Looks like your mother
let a big, brawny fellow into her bed

11:38.156 --> 11:39.954
while your faither wasn't looking.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.747
"As the old cock craws..."

11:42.118 --> 11:43.415
ls that right?

11:45.496 --> 11:47.464
There's a bag of oat.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.294
Marcus, you limmer,
it's good to see you.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.636
What've you got for me?

11:52.795 --> 11:54.797
Two fat pigs and a fine goat.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.722
Hello.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.732
That's two fat pigs

12:05.225 --> 12:06.351
and a fine goat.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.357
We'll see you tonight.
You'll join me for a dram?

12:09.020 --> 12:10.317
- Aye!
- Good.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.153
I thought you said no pigs.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.739
Aye, I did, didn't I?

12:15.818 --> 12:17.491
Duncan, thank you.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.163
Two shilling
and one six-pence.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.050
Something I can do for you, Mistress?

12:39.342 --> 12:41.344
I was just curious.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.685
I've never heard singing
quite like that before.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.517
'Tis a waulking song.
We're waulking wool.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.602
I'm Claire Beauchamp.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.438
I'm Donalda Gilchrest.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.857
I came with the MacKenzie party.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.611
The men are all busy with the rent,
so I found myself rather idle.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.197
Idle, ye say.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.873
Well, we'll see about that.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.327
Do ye have strong hands, Claire?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.603
Ladies, this is Claire Beauchamp.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.473
She's going to be helping us today.

13:27.682 --> 13:28.729
Hello, all.

13:35.690 --> 13:36.907
That's pungent.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.986
- Is that...
- Hot piss. Yes, Claire.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.362
Sets the dye fast.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.804
Here's a wee refreshment, Claire.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.218
Ye've earned it.

14:45.468 --> 14:46.640
Thank you.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.807
Bottoms up.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.903
Oh, my God, that's got a kick to it.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.989
It's our little secret.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.661
Not a word to the menfolk.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.158
My lips are sealed.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.249
Did we wake the little one?

15:09.325 --> 15:11.123
He's hungry, that's all.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.333
He's teething and won't nurse.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.754
My husband had to
give away our goat to the laird

15:16.833 --> 15:19.256
this morning,
so we haven't any milk.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.841
Doesn't seem very fair.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.677
Where are ye off to next, Claire?

15:24.966 --> 15:26.343
I'm not sure exactly.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.307
I heard stories of a place
called Craigh na Dun.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.108
Aye, where the fairies live.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.361
My cousin went there once,
swore he saw one.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.696
But he was fou
as a puggie at time,

15:40.148 --> 15:42.446
and the fairy he claimed to see

15:42.525 --> 15:45.119
turned out to be
an old piebald sheep,

15:45.194 --> 15:46.662
sporting six horns.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.538
Well, I'd like to go there.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.210
Is it nearby?

15:53.161 --> 15:56.461
About three days
as the crow flies, I'd say.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.088
All right, back to work, ladies.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.545
And we're going to need
a fresh bucket.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.720
You mean now?

16:11.053 --> 16:12.726
What do you think the tipple's for?

16:16.517 --> 16:17.939
All righty, then.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.277
Geronimo.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.618
Christ almighty.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.246
I've been looking to
hell and back for ye.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.127
I've been right here.
We were waulking wool.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.090
Right! We're going.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.216
But we haven't finished.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.760
Aye, ye have.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.925
Disappearing under ma nose.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.806
Dougal's bealing about it.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.853
I was only over there.
What's the harm?

16:52.929 --> 16:55.682
Ye've been drinking,
and ye smell like piss.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.563
Well, that's the pot
calling the kettle black.

16:57.642 --> 16:58.643
Fine.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.820
Next time' I'll tie ye to the wagon.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.568
Get your hands off me!

17:13.449 --> 17:15.247
Hey, hey, where do you
think you're taking that?

17:15.409 --> 17:17.457
Back to her owner.
The family needs her.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.005
The goat's ours.
We're taking her with us.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.080
The hell you are.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.508
That's goods and chattels,
has to be accounted for.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.881
Ca' canny noo. She's stoning drunk.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.133
I am no such thing.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.805
You'll be giving me the goat!

17:27.880 --> 17:29.132
Let go!

17:30.216 --> 17:31.638
Where did you find her?

17:31.717 --> 17:33.469
Over there and cock-a-doodle-dooed.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.398
How hard is it to keep watch
on a Sassenach wench?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.651
Hey, she's slippery as an eel,
that one, Dougal.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.811
Would you stop talking
about me as if I'm not here?

17:42.562 --> 17:43.984
There's a baby that needs milk.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.324
Stop yer havering, woman.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.903
The beast is payment for rent,
fair and square.

17:51.279 --> 17:52.622
So you'd let a child go hungry?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.080
The goat goes with us.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.673
A Sassenach fleeing drunk forbye.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.056
Madam, is everything all right?

18:15.761 --> 18:16.853
I'm sorry?

18:17.513 --> 18:18.514
May I be of service?

18:18.639 --> 18:21.813
Aye, you'll keep
your nose out of our business.

18:23.686 --> 18:24.733
I was speaking to the lady.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.315
The lady is a guest
of clan MacKenzie.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.692
Do you treat
all your guests this way?

18:29.859 --> 18:32.533
Hey, bugger off.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.541
Or maybe your lugs need cleaning out.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.961
I assure you, sir,
my lugs are perfectly fine.

18:40.036 --> 18:44.382
Go home, laddie,
and suckle on your ma's tit.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.402
Now, get to it. We're leaving.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.548
Ave, ave,
the land's been good to ye this year.

19:33.631 --> 19:34.723
Aye.

19:35.049 --> 19:38.178
I hear ye've had
a braw harvest of oats.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.352
Aye.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.938
Galloway,

19:42.223 --> 19:43.600
I can tell you've not been starving.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.982
You want to watch yer back around
these drunken bastards

19:47.061 --> 19:48.483
showing a pair of paps like thon.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.284
Aye.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.583
- Aye.
- Aye, well enough.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.169
It's not a great deal,
but we canna expect much

22:12.248 --> 22:13.500
from a small place like this.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.926
Still, it's a respectable sum.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.926
And with young Jamie's back to show,

22:19.672 --> 22:21.640
it's money in the bank guaranteed.

22:21.882 --> 22:22.883
Be a good lass.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.435
Get a needle and thread. Mend that.

22:26.387 --> 22:27.855
Mend it yourself.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.851
I'm not bloody doing it.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.607
The lad can wear rags from now on.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.157
Fine. Give it to me.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.079
I'll mend my own shirt.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.223
Black pudding?

23:09.179 --> 23:11.807
It's an acquired taste,
I know, but...

23:12.141 --> 23:13.313
Thank you.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.028
How do you think Colum will feel
about you helping Dougal

23:24.111 --> 23:26.364
to steal money from him
to line his own pockets

23:26.697 --> 23:28.995
and using his nephew Jamie to do it?

23:31.076 --> 23:32.578
Aren't you the canny lass?

23:33.245 --> 23:34.918
Just wondering how it works.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.670
Two bags of money, obviously.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.886
Are there two sets of books as well,
one for each brother?

23:42.838 --> 23:45.182
Seems that you've got it
all sorted out.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.640
I'll wager they don't
teach common thievery

23:48.719 --> 23:50.096
at the University of Edinburgh.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.228
I suspect that's a skill
you've acquired more recently.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.685
I must say,
you got a good head on your shoulders

23:55.768 --> 23:57.770
and a tongue for argument as well.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.855
You'd make a fine advocate, yourself.

24:00.814 --> 24:04.409
It's a pity they don't
allow women to practice law.

24:05.319 --> 24:06.411
Not yet.

24:08.322 --> 24:11.166
It'll be a few centuries
before that happens.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.120
Only two.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.340
<i>It felt as if Dougal
could read my mind,</i>

24:23.712 --> 24:25.885
<i>like he was daring me to run.</i>

24:28.258 --> 24:29.885
<i>He had brought me along on this trip</i>

24:29.969 --> 24:32.267
<i>because I earned
his respect as a healer</i>

24:32.721 --> 24:34.723
<i>and at least some measure of trust.</i>

24:37.476 --> 24:41.356
<i>But now I could see
that small trust slipping away,</i>

24:41.647 --> 24:43.900
<i>and with it, my dream of escape.</i>

24:47.319 --> 24:50.619
<i>The days passed in a blur,
turning into weeks,</i>

24:52.616 --> 24:55.119
<i>We visited village after village,</i>

24:55.619 --> 24:58.247
<i>my feeling of helplessness growing.</i>

25:07.923 --> 25:11.097
<i>Even amongst the vast
and beautiful landscape,</i>

25:11.760 --> 25:13.307
<i>I felt trapped,</i>

25:13.387 --> 25:16.561
<i>as if I were back in
the stone walls of Castle Leoch.</i>

25:18.934 --> 25:20.436
<i>Would I have to reconcile myself</i>

25:20.519 --> 25:23.113
<i>to live the rest of my life
amongst strangers</i>

25:25.733 --> 25:27.610
<i>200 years in the past?</i>

25:53.719 --> 25:57.189
No, no! Leave us alone.

25:58.807 --> 25:59.899
What's going on?

26:00.059 --> 26:01.276
It's the watch.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.896
Men you pay to protect your cattle.

26:04.146 --> 26:06.148
Otherwise, they'll steal
them themselves.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.317
- Extortionists.
- Aye.

26:13.864 --> 26:15.332
Hey, hey!

26:19.203 --> 26:20.455
Why burn the house?

26:20.537 --> 26:22.710
It's a warning.
I heard talk in the village.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.009
The husband's a sympathizer
working with the Redcoats.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.340
That's only gossip.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.804
It's no excuse for criminal behavior.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.350
The Watch may be criminal,
but they're Scots first.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.310
They can't abide traitors
who do the bidding

26:35.385 --> 26:36.728
of the British army.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.119
How many?

26:53.195 --> 26:54.538
- Two.
- Two?

26:56.198 --> 26:57.916
And Dougal taking his out?

26:58.450 --> 26:59.952
I suppose that's patriotism as well.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.127
No, no, no, no, my dear.

27:01.203 --> 27:03.297
No, no, no. No, that's business.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.555
Where's Jamie?

27:12.673 --> 27:14.675
He's making himself scarce.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.810
He has a price on his head, remember.

27:17.261 --> 27:18.808
The Watch would turn him
over in a minute

27:18.887 --> 27:20.355
if they thought there
was profit involved.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.558
Patriots until it
profits them not to be.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.732
Their loyalty lies
where the money lies.

27:25.811 --> 27:26.983
Off we go.

27:36.572 --> 27:39.246
I was,
I was slipping her the wee man

27:40.534 --> 27:41.660
all night long,

27:41.743 --> 27:44.166
and she was gaming for it. Ganting!

27:45.247 --> 27:48.046
I gave the lassie such a seeing-to.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.629
She'll be walking
bow-legged for months.

27:51.753 --> 27:54.006
Aye, aye, you sleekit dog.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.472
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

27:58.552 --> 27:59.678
What's the matter with you?

28:01.513 --> 28:03.231
I've no stomach for stolen food.

28:04.474 --> 28:05.976
Please yourself.

28:09.438 --> 28:10.735
And I don't sit with thieves.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.111
Listen, you. Hey!

28:12.316 --> 28:15.946
I will not be judged
by an English whore.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.622
Angus.

28:20.949 --> 28:22.121
Angus.

28:24.328 --> 28:27.423
She doesn't want it,
all the more for us?

28:39.801 --> 28:41.178
Excuse me.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.321
Here, Rupert.

28:56.318 --> 28:57.865
There's something to
wrap your hands around

28:57.945 --> 28:59.663
other than your todger.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.968
What's got into you, woman,
talking to Angus that way?

29:17.381 --> 29:19.224
Angus can kiss my English arse.

29:21.343 --> 29:23.471
Aye, he's a clarty bastard,

29:24.763 --> 29:25.980
but those are fighting words.

29:26.056 --> 29:27.273
Well, where I come from, we don't...

29:27.349 --> 29:30.694
It doesn't matter
where you come from. You're here.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.278
So I'm just to stand by and watch?

29:36.149 --> 29:38.902
You're not to judge things
you don't understand.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.572
Stay out of it, Claire.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.527
Torcall.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.787
You come to me with empty pockets.
What's going on?

31:12.120 --> 31:14.919
Redcoats came through two days ago,

31:15.540 --> 31:17.963
house to house,
took what they wanted.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.051
You know me, brother.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.592
Every year,
I pay what I owe to the MacKenzie.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.179
But tonight

31:29.221 --> 31:30.973
I canna feed my family.

31:46.780 --> 31:48.703
Your family will have supper tonight,

31:49.241 --> 31:50.993
and afterwards,
you'll join us for a drink.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.171
All of ye will eat!

31:54.788 --> 31:56.506
Join us tonight for a dram.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.670
I know what you're doing.

32:01.503 --> 32:02.925
The more mercy you show today,

32:03.004 --> 32:05.678
the more you collect
tonight for yourself.

32:06.508 --> 32:08.852
Aye, the lassie can
see right through us.

32:09.511 --> 32:12.515
We Scots are not as canny
as the English, yes.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.061
Good thing we're not doing this
in Oxfordshire.

32:22.524 --> 32:24.197
What is it that
you're accusing me of?

32:26.278 --> 32:28.872
A penny for the laird'
a pound for your own pocket.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.832
Whatever you wish to call it.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.540
I call it clan business,
and none of yours.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.996
<i>Events followed a familiar pattern,</i>

33:15.118 --> 33:16.916
<i>but for my sympathies for Jamie,</i>

33:17.078 --> 33:20.298
<i>I had little interest in
Dougal's self-serving performance.</i>

33:20.999 --> 33:24.424
<i>The language as alien as ever,
but the sentiment clear.</i>

33:24.920 --> 33:28.470
<i>"Give us your money, and we will
protect you from the English,</i>

33:28.840 --> 33:30.092
<i>"from the Sassenachs."</i>

33:30.175 --> 33:31.893
An awful sight, is it, no?

33:32.260 --> 33:36.265
Christ, I'd die in my blood before I
let a whey-faced Sassenach use me so.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.478
Aye.

33:40.227 --> 33:43.697
<i>But then my ears sparked to a name
I'd heard somewhere before.</i>

33:49.986 --> 33:51.909
<i>“Long live the Stuart. "</i>

33:52.572 --> 33:56.293
Of course that would be the
second Jacobite rising, the '45.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.502
Second?

33:59.120 --> 34:02.499
You know, some people actually argue
that there were four uprisings.

34:02.582 --> 34:04.630
The first in 1715,

34:04.709 --> 34:06.632
and the '45 was just
the most famous one.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.389
Bonnie Prince Charlie and so on.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.094
That's it.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.011
Charlie, the young pretender
to the throne of Britain,

34:14.094 --> 34:18.099
was gathering Stuart sympathizers,
called Jacobites, for a rebellion.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.817
Surely your Uncle Lamb
taught you some of this.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.103
What were you doing in the desert?

34:26.690 --> 34:28.283
"Jacobite," derived from "Jacobus,"

34:28.358 --> 34:30.235
the Latin for "James,"
since they were followers

34:30.318 --> 34:32.446
of King James ll, the Catholic king

34:32.529 --> 34:34.907
dethroned by the Protestants.

34:36.116 --> 34:38.369
Show-off.
- That's it, quite right.

34:39.369 --> 34:41.463
So the Jacobites
dedicated themselves

34:41.538 --> 34:43.210
to restoring a Catholic King.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.634
And Charles Stuart
used the Scottish Highlanders

34:45.708 --> 34:47.460
to raise money for a Jacobite army.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.589
A lost cause as it turned out.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.770
<i>I was beginning
to realize the activities</i>

35:05.854 --> 35:09.028
<i>Dougal and his men
were involved in weren't criminal.</i>

35:09.107 --> 35:10.404
<i>They were political.</i>

35:11.359 --> 35:14.283
<i>He was using the shocking
display of Jamie's scars</i>

35:14.362 --> 35:16.239
<i>not to frighten his audience,</i>

35:16.323 --> 35:19.042
<i>but to stir outrage
against the British.</i>

35:20.952 --> 35:24.047
<i>Dougal was raising money
for a Jacobite army.</i>

35:25.040 --> 35:27.134
Devil take ye, Dougal MacKenzie.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.382
Kinsman or not, I don't owe ye this.

35:30.420 --> 35:34.050
I seem to recall
a certain oath of obedience.

35:34.716 --> 35:37.595
"So long as my feet rest
on the lands of clan MacKenzie."

35:37.677 --> 35:39.270
I gave my word to Colum, not to you.

35:39.346 --> 35:41.724
It's one and the same' lad,
and you ken it well.

35:42.515 --> 35:43.812
Outside of Leoch,

35:43.892 --> 35:47.237
I am Colum's head, hands,
as well as his legs.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.447
I never saw a better case
of the right hand

35:49.522 --> 35:51.069
not knowing what the left was up to.

35:51.232 --> 35:54.406
The MacKenzies,
the MacBeolains, the MacVinishes...

35:54.486 --> 35:57.080
None can force them
to give against their will.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.082
But we have something in common.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.662
We want our king
back where he belongs.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.295
Don't you?

36:11.878 --> 36:14.097
You have more to gain
from a Stuart throne than I do.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.677
If you don't want to save
your own silly neck...

36:15.757 --> 36:19.478
My neck is my own concern,
and so is my back.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.522
Not while you travel with me,
sweet lad.

37:06.808 --> 37:10.187
He'll do that again,
use you like that?

37:10.979 --> 37:12.071
Aye.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.822
Aye, it gets him
what he wants, you see.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.496
And you'll let him?

37:23.533 --> 37:25.035
He's my uncle.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.085
A man has to...

37:33.835 --> 37:35.087
To choose

37:35.879 --> 37:37.347
what's worth fighting for.

37:44.345 --> 37:45.813
As you ken well.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.399
Well...

37:58.443 --> 37:59.911
Best get some sleep.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.747
Yes, of course.

38:07.076 --> 38:08.828
Try not to hit any more trees.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.083
Don't worry.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.128
Trees are safe, Sassenach.

38:20.715 --> 38:21.887
Good night.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.667
<i>The next morning
as I watched them pack,</i>

38:47.742 --> 38:50.040
<i>I saw the men in a different light.</i>

38:50.119 --> 38:51.996
<i>Not criminals, but rebels.</i>

38:53.289 --> 38:54.415
<i>I wished I could tell them</i>

38:54.499 --> 38:57.002
<i>that they were on
the losing side of history,</i>

38:57.085 --> 38:58.803
<i>that it was all a pipe dream.</i>

38:59.337 --> 39:03.012
<i>The Stuarts would never
unseat the Protestant King George H,</i>

39:03.341 --> 39:05.093
<i>but how could I tell them that,</i>

39:05.385 --> 39:08.764
<i>these proud, passionate meh
who lived and breathed</i>

39:08.847 --> 39:10.599
<i>for a flag of blue and white?</i>

40:21.419 --> 40:22.511
Traitor.

40:25.632 --> 40:28.932
<i>Even I knew that
this was not the work of the Watch,</i>

40:29.010 --> 40:30.637
<i>but of the Redcoats.</i>

40:30.720 --> 40:32.347
They've been out here
at least a week.

40:32.472 --> 40:34.895
More, likely, by the smell.

40:35.350 --> 40:36.943
Bloody bastards!

40:41.689 --> 40:42.906
Take them down.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.027
Wrap the bodies.

40:46.110 --> 40:48.283
We'll give them
a proper Christian burial.

43:19.722 --> 43:21.190
What on earth?

43:23.518 --> 43:25.862
What are you doing
sneaking around outside my door?

43:26.062 --> 43:28.190
I wasn't sneaking about.
I was sleeping...

43:28.606 --> 43:29.858
Or trying to.

43:30.483 --> 43:31.985
Sleeping here?

43:32.360 --> 43:33.452
Why?

43:35.029 --> 43:38.203
The taproom's full of townsmen
half-gone with drink.

43:38.783 --> 43:41.127
I was worried some of them might
venture up here in search of...

43:41.744 --> 43:43.041
Well...

43:43.371 --> 43:45.624
I didn't think you'd care
overmuch for such attentions.

43:47.917 --> 43:50.545
After the events of today,
I doubt any of them

43:50.628 --> 43:52.881
are feeling very kindly
towards an Englishwoman.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.389
I'm sorry I stepped on you.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.399
You're being kind.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.476
No.

44:09.522 --> 44:11.445
You can't sleep out here.

44:11.524 --> 44:14.027
At least come into the room.

44:14.402 --> 44:15.824
It's warmer.

44:17.321 --> 44:19.574
Sleep in your room with you?

44:20.575 --> 44:23.624
I couldn't do that.
Your reputation would be ruined.

44:25.955 --> 44:27.457
My reputation?

44:28.416 --> 44:30.760
You've slept under
the stars with me before,

44:31.252 --> 44:33.095
you and ten other men.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.757
That isn't the same thing at all.

44:39.427 --> 44:42.351
Well, at least let me
give you the blanket off my bed.

44:42.430 --> 44:44.273
Or is that too scandalous?

45:09.373 --> 45:10.625
I'll be right here.

45:15.296 --> 45:16.468
Good night.

45:49.830 --> 45:51.207
Good morning, Mr. MacTavish.

45:51.290 --> 45:52.837
Morning, Mistress.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.177
Now, if you'll excuse me,

45:55.253 --> 45:57.301
the horses will be needing
their breakfast as well.

46:27.034 --> 46:29.287
Why did you let me think
you were thieves?

46:31.706 --> 46:33.549
What's made you think otherwise?

46:33.666 --> 46:35.668
Dougal's speech the other night.

46:38.546 --> 46:40.139
I thought you had no Gaelic.

46:40.589 --> 46:43.138
Well, I've picked up
enough to understand what

46:43.217 --> 46:45.686
"Long live the Stuart" sounds like.

46:45.761 --> 46:48.230
You might've picked up
more than you should.

46:53.019 --> 46:54.692
What if I told you

46:55.146 --> 46:56.989
that the odds were
stacked against you?

46:57.857 --> 46:59.655
And which odds are those?

46:59.942 --> 47:01.819
The British army
is the best in the world.

47:02.361 --> 47:04.739
That's a known fact. What of it?

47:04.822 --> 47:06.824
You're raising money
for a war that you cannot win.

47:06.907 --> 47:09.001
And that worries you, does it?

47:09.243 --> 47:11.086
You're the ones
that should be worried.

47:18.377 --> 47:20.846
You talk as if the future
is already decided.

47:21.130 --> 47:23.132
Outmanned we may be,

47:23.507 --> 47:25.601
but I would match our fighting hearts

47:25.676 --> 47:27.849
against the best army in the world.

47:27.928 --> 47:30.772
Fighting hearts
don't stand a chance against cannons.

47:31.724 --> 47:33.146
You are going to lose.

47:34.393 --> 47:36.236
That's your opinion,

47:36.312 --> 47:37.905
and you're entitled to it.

47:41.942 --> 47:43.615
It's a fact, Ned.

47:44.236 --> 47:45.658
You have to believe me.

47:46.322 --> 47:49.246
History will never record the name
of another Stuart king,

47:49.909 --> 47:52.378
but it will record
the names of thousands of Highlanders

47:52.453 --> 47:55.002
who've died needlessly
for a doomed cause.

47:58.501 --> 48:00.174
History be damned.

48:15.976 --> 48:17.273
Here we go.

48:41.961 --> 48:43.178
Get up!

48:43.254 --> 48:45.757
Pick him up! Hold the bastard!

48:49.802 --> 48:52.851
Three split lips, two bloody noses,

48:53.389 --> 48:56.484
12 smashed knuckles,
and four loosened teeth.

48:56.559 --> 48:57.685
And my ribs hurt a bit.

48:59.019 --> 49:02.193
Bastard's fingernail was sharp
as a boars tooth.

49:02.565 --> 49:03.782
He's gauged a hole in me.

49:05.192 --> 49:07.035
You're such crybabies.

49:07.278 --> 49:10.031
I've tended to six-year-olds
braver than you lot.

49:10.865 --> 49:12.037
Any excuse for a fight.

49:12.283 --> 49:13.660
You were the excuse.

49:17.413 --> 49:18.460
Me?

49:20.040 --> 49:21.883
It was your honor we were defending.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.712
The lout called you a whore.

49:32.136 --> 49:33.763
You're a guest of the MacKenzie.

49:35.222 --> 49:37.099
We can insult you,

49:37.183 --> 49:39.527
but God help any other man that does.

49:54.408 --> 49:56.661
So there I am in bed,

49:56.744 --> 49:58.621
Harelip Chrissie on my left

49:58.704 --> 50:02.004
and Sweaty Netty,
the butcher's daughter, on my right.

50:02.416 --> 50:04.009
They get jealous of each other,

50:04.084 --> 50:06.587
start arguing about
who I'm going to swive first.

50:06.837 --> 50:07.963
Can you believe it?

50:08.547 --> 50:11.016
I believe your left hand
gets jealous of your right.

50:11.091 --> 50:12.718
That's about all I believe.

50:29.735 --> 50:31.203
You're a witty one.

50:33.322 --> 50:35.700
I've never heard a woman make a joke!

50:35.783 --> 50:37.751
There's a first time for everything.

50:42.456 --> 50:43.673
Hard ride ahead.

50:45.209 --> 50:47.177
Three days till
we cross Culloden Moor.

50:50.130 --> 50:51.632
<i>Culloden Moor.</i>

50:58.305 --> 51:01.309
You can see how flat
and open and boggy it is.

51:02.017 --> 51:04.065
The Highland army
was completely exposed,

51:04.144 --> 51:08.490
and they then charged
into the teeth of musket fire,

51:08.566 --> 51:10.318
cannons, mortars

51:10.985 --> 51:13.829
with nothing more than
their broadswords, for the most part.

51:16.115 --> 51:19.039
It was very, very quick
and very bloody.

51:20.244 --> 51:21.996
The whole thing took
less than an hour.

51:22.830 --> 51:23.956
How many were killed?

51:24.039 --> 51:27.339
Jacobites lost something in
the region of 2,000 men.

51:28.919 --> 51:32.048
But the interesting thing is
that in the years following Culloden,

51:32.298 --> 51:36.599
the estates of the clan chieftains
were plundered, sold.

51:36.844 --> 51:39.142
The government banned
the wearing of tartan.

51:39.388 --> 51:42.358
They banned the carrying of swords,
even the Gaelic language.

51:43.309 --> 51:47.030
In effect, Culloden marked
the end of the clans

51:47.980 --> 51:50.074
and the end of
the Highlander way of life.

52:11.420 --> 52:15.050
<i>1746, three years from now.</i>

52:17.217 --> 52:19.345
<i>And what of these MacKenzie men?</i>

52:20.387 --> 52:24.062
<i>How many of them were doomed to die
on that wretched battlefield?</i>

52:54.380 --> 52:56.132
Here, let me see.

53:02.096 --> 53:03.769
Thank you, Angus.

53:23.909 --> 53:25.456
I'm going to the river to wash.

53:28.539 --> 53:29.916
Let her go.

53:32.876 --> 53:36.346
Now, as regards the transactions...

53:40.300 --> 53:44.350
Comparatively successful
despite the earlier setbacks.

53:58.819 --> 54:00.241
Who are you?

54:02.906 --> 54:05.125
An English lady of Oxfordshire.

54:05.367 --> 54:06.835
That's what you'd have us believe.

54:08.245 --> 54:11.840
But you would seem to be a lady
of strong political opinions.

54:12.124 --> 54:13.341
There's no harm in an opinion.

54:13.500 --> 54:16.094
You've seen things on the road.

54:16.503 --> 54:17.595
You tell the Redcoats,

54:17.671 --> 54:19.890
and we'll be bound to crosses
just like the men we out down.

54:20.632 --> 54:23.055
- I'm not a spy.
- Maybe not.

54:23.427 --> 54:26.021
But ye're sowing the seeds
of doubt in our midst,

54:26.847 --> 54:29.191
working behind the cover
of yer woman's skirts

54:29.308 --> 54:30.275
to undermine the cause.

54:30.350 --> 54:31.852
I'm trying to warn you.

54:33.687 --> 54:34.984
Warn me about what?

54:40.694 --> 54:42.696
I'm trying to save your life.

54:43.197 --> 54:44.244
Madam...

54:59.588 --> 55:01.340
Pleasure to see you again.

55:05.761 --> 55:07.183
Once more, I ask you...

55:15.729 --> 55:17.151
ls everything all right?

55:24.738 --> 55:26.115
Hello, again, Officer.

55:26.740 --> 55:29.994
Lieutenant Jeremy Foster
of His Majesty's army.

55:30.077 --> 55:33.001
And this time I do mean
to ascertain the lady's well-being.

55:33.580 --> 55:36.003
The lady is none of your concern.

55:36.792 --> 55:38.009
And you are?

55:38.252 --> 55:41.506
Dougal MacKenzie,
war chief and brother to Colum,

55:41.922 --> 55:45.426
laird of the MacKenzie clan
and the lands upon which you stand.

55:46.385 --> 55:47.728
MacKenzie or not,

55:47.803 --> 55:50.056
if you are holding this English lady
against her wishes,

55:50.138 --> 55:51.230
you'll be dealt with.

55:53.392 --> 55:55.861
Tell me, madam,
are you here by your own choice?

55:58.800 --> 56:06.800
