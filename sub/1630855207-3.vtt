WEBVTT

00:09.384 --> 00:10.635
I hope you're hungry.

00:23.398 --> 00:26.234
Let's make this quick.
This place smells like a wet ox.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.821
MAY ALL YOUR HOPES BE FULFILLED

00:31.031 --> 00:33.158
ALL THE GOOD LUCK YOU CAN EAT

00:39.456 --> 00:40.582
What do you think?

00:41.458 --> 00:42.792
We serve ourselves?

00:44.669 --> 00:48.548
Oh, don't fill up on the rice.
Focus on the good stuff.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.510
It's been a long time
since we've eaten together.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.678
That's true.

00:53.678 --> 00:57.140
And you don't look
a day over 40,000, Wukong.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.642
That's kind of you to say.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.729
But kids do age you.

01:02.729 --> 01:06.232
Look at me. A member of
the Jade Emperor's inner circle,

01:06.232 --> 01:07.901
and I can't even control my own son.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.736
Perhaps you don't have to.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.071
So that's your stance then?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.697
I don't have a stance.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.824
You slammed me into a wall.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.703
I just want your son
to have the same chances you did.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.705
Have a little faith in him.

01:20.705 --> 01:21.873
Why?

01:21.873 --> 01:23.583
He stole from me. He disobeyed me.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.002
As Ao Guang, the Dragon King, once said,

01:26.586 --> 01:28.213
"Faith is a gift, not a reward."

01:28.213 --> 01:30.799
Ao Guang also has
the brains of a goldfish.

01:30.799 --> 01:34.803
I know Wei-Chen is
overly confident and reckless,

01:34.803 --> 01:36.429
but it's in his nature.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.766
Well, he needs to learn to grow up
and control that nature.

01:39.766 --> 01:40.892
Like I did.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.061
Easier said than done.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.822
You know this could end very badly,
don't you?

01:53.822 --> 01:55.698
If Niu Mowang gets <i>jīn gū bàng</i>,

01:55.698 --> 01:57.575
who knows what darkness he could unleash.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.119
I am aware.

01:59.119 --> 02:03.289
That's why I'm watching Wei-Chen
as I did you once upon a time.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.542
That was different.
That was a sacred mission.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.210
He's chasing a silly dream.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.295
Dreams can bring great success.

02:10.004 --> 02:11.005
Or great failure.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.174
Failure can bring enlightenment.

02:13.174 --> 02:16.594
Enlightenment will not bring us
victory over Niu Mowang and his uprising.

02:16.594 --> 02:20.306
Wukong, enlightenment is victory.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.769
Okay.

02:24.769 --> 02:27.438
One more week,
then I drag him back on my own.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.487
Didn't they say
these drinks were bottomless?

02:43.496 --> 02:44.873
Time for seconds.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.156
Oh, my God.

03:19.949 --> 03:22.202
No! No!

03:35.673 --> 03:37.592
Jin, breakfast!

03:54.108 --> 03:56.152
It's the fall sports pep rally!

04:10.833 --> 04:17.840
First up is the defending
regional champion boys soccer team!

04:31.437 --> 04:33.106
Dude, welcome to rock star status.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.942
Yeah.
Nah, this is pretty cool.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.027
Oh, no. I'm not talking
about the pep rally.

04:38.027 --> 04:41.447
I mean our phones, bro.
I am blowing up right now.

04:41.447 --> 04:44.200
Last time I had this many likes,
I was in the hospital.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.432
Let's hear it for your Fighting Cranes!

05:13.229 --> 05:15.648
<i>If you left your backpack
at the pep rally,</i>

05:15.648 --> 05:17.108
<i>please report to the principal's...</i>

05:17.108 --> 05:18.443
Jin.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.821
Are you okay?

05:21.821 --> 05:23.072
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

05:23.072 --> 05:26.034
You hit your head so hard.
I was worried all night.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.038
So, that really happened?

05:31.581 --> 05:33.916
Okay. [stammers] Can you just
explain that to me, so what--

05:33.916 --> 05:36.794
You beat the crap out of a gardener
so hard he turned into a pig?

05:36.794 --> 05:39.422
He's not a gardener.
His name is Zhu Bajiè.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.798
And he works for my dad.

05:40.798 --> 05:43.176
I thought you said
your dad worked in another country.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.844
No, he lives in Heaven.

05:45.803 --> 05:48.222
His name is Sun Wukong.
He's the Monkey King.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.476
Okay, cool. I just came to see
if they had any oatmeal cookies,

05:51.476 --> 05:53.061
- so I'm gonna--
- Jin, wait.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.565
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's real.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.693
I'm not from this world and...

06:02.195 --> 06:03.196
I need your help.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.822
You need my help?

06:04.822 --> 06:06.157
Yes.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.743
Just listen. I had a dream.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.703
A crane spoke to me and said

06:10.703 --> 06:14.082
there's a hero
and his guide will find the Fourth Scroll.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.001
And do you know what I saw
when I first arrived here?

06:17.001 --> 06:18.294
What?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.552
This.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.306
A crane!

06:30.306 --> 06:33.059
- That's a sign. You are my guide.
- Yeah-- Yeah, dude,

06:33.059 --> 06:35.269
I don't know anything
about any fourth scrolls.

06:35.269 --> 06:37.146
And, honestly,
I don't even speak Chinese that well.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.272
Jin, it's okay.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.858
Just come to my house
and talk to my guardian.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.276
She will explain everything to you.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.695
I thought you said
you live with your aunt.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.948
Well, she's not actually my aunt.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.117
- Okay, so you--
- Jin! Can I talk to you for a sec?

06:49.117 --> 06:51.911
- Just--
- Yes. Hey, just give me a sec, Trav.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.414
Please, I-- Jin.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.960
Five o'clock. Please.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.547
Yeah, okay. I'll come.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.342
Hey, what's up, man?

07:06.342 --> 07:08.636
Throwing a little team hang
after practice today.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.097
- You should come.
- Yeah, definitely, I'll stop by.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.765
- Uh...
- See you there.

07:32.201 --> 07:35.663
The more you move, the longer it takes.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.624
Sorry. That one makes me nervous.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.877
It's just so close to my eyes.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.379
Third eye.

07:43.379 --> 07:47.175
The gate to higher consciousness.

07:47.175 --> 07:51.345
And hopefully less headaches.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.099
Bad joke.

07:55.099 --> 07:57.602
Your gate is blocked.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.644
Blocked?

07:59.687 --> 08:00.688
Why?

08:00.688 --> 08:02.482
How long have you been married again?

08:03.149 --> 08:04.817
Uh, eighteen years.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.320
You're going to need a double session.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.698
Let me see your tongue.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.785
What?

08:14.785 --> 08:18.164
I've never seen a tongue like this.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.836
- Hmm? Did you just take a picture?
- Hmm.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.296
For your files?

08:26.464 --> 08:28.049
No. Not my files.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.723
Hey, Melly.

08:35.723 --> 08:38.476
- Hi, Mrs. Wang. Feeling better?
- Yeah, a little.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.354
Oh, I need a bottle of this, uh,
herbal powder too.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.438
You got it.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.690
How's college? Studying hard?

08:44.690 --> 08:47.276
I'm actually taking a year off
to focus on my music.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.653
Good for you.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.947
Young people should follow their dreams.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.783
- So what kind of music do you make?
- It's kind of hard to explain.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.368
Do you know what bubblegrunge is?

08:55.952 --> 08:56.953
No.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.538
- Nu metal?
- No.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.122
- Hyperpop?
- Mm-mmm.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.123
- Glitch hop?
- No.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.166
Trapwave?

09:02.166 --> 09:05.503
Uh, sorry, Melly,
I don't know any of your music styles.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.297
Oh, it's none of those
but has elements of all of them.

09:08.297 --> 09:09.799
Sounds interesting.

09:10.299 --> 09:12.552
It's nice to see you
taking care of your grandma.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.888
Oh, I'm not taking care of her.
I'm helping her pack up the shop.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.848
- What do you mean?
- We're closing.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.934
Rents are going up, sales are going down.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.687
Plus, you can buy Chinese herbs
from white-people stores now,

09:22.687 --> 09:24.230
so it's kind of over for us.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.439
That's terrible.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.358
I better get a whole case then,

09:27.358 --> 09:29.443
since you won't be open
for much longer, huh?

09:29.443 --> 09:30.611
Yeah.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.321
Sucks for Grandma.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.323
That's actually the title
of one of my songs.

09:34.323 --> 09:37.118
<i>♪ Sucks for Grandma ♪</i>

09:37.118 --> 09:38.536
<i>♪ Sucks for Grandma ♪</i>

09:38.536 --> 09:40.371
<i>♪ Sucks for Grandma
Su-- ♪</i>

09:56.053 --> 09:57.597
Hey, bro!

09:57.597 --> 09:59.015
Yo, Jin!

09:59.015 --> 10:00.474
Over here.

10:00.474 --> 10:01.726
Hey.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.145
- What's up, man?
- What up, bro?

10:04.145 --> 10:06.314
- This is a cool place.
- Thanks.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.358
Yeah, if you like fire pits
and huge Jacuzzis. It's great, right?

10:09.358 --> 10:11.360
Well, it's my mom's boyfriend's place.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.612
His place is bomb-ass.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.655
Gotta stop saying "bomb-ass," man. Really.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.990
Everyone says "bomb-ass."

10:15.990 --> 10:20.786
Uh, hey, Trav, um, I feel like we kind of
got off on the wrong foot last week.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.205
Oh, you mean
when you tried to break my neck?

10:23.205 --> 10:24.290
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.543
I'm just messing with you, dude.
Chill out.

10:27.543 --> 10:28.794
Wait, seriously?

10:28.794 --> 10:31.631
Yeah. I mean, we're all teammates
now, right? Fresh start.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.425
- Yeah, thanks. I appreciate that, man.
- Yeah, of course.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.927
Uh, we do need your help
with something real quick.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.304
- Josh's hair...
- Yeah.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.890
...looks like he tried to cut it
with rocks or something.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.684
- Dude. I didn't cut it. Someone else did.
- No. It's bad.

10:43.684 --> 10:46.729
- Actually, it was 60 bucks plus tip, so--
- Mmm. Still bad.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.650
Hey, uh, I thought you said
this was gonna be a soccer thing.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.526
Oh, yeah.
We invited some other people too.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.028
Oh, yeah. Cool. Yeah, for sure.

10:54.028 --> 10:57.239
- Does anyone know what the Wi-Fi is?
- Uh, the network is "Josh's hair."

10:57.239 --> 10:59.492
Password is "looks terrible 45."

10:59.492 --> 11:01.285
- It's all lowercase.
- Okay, okay. Yeah.

11:06.248 --> 11:09.627
Freddy, I'm not sure
this is what they mean by "pumping iron."

11:11.545 --> 11:14.382
I wanna be just like Arnold Sportsinvader.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.008
I have seen all of his movie.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.552
<i>Complete Recall</i>, <i>Twin Sibling</i>,

11:18.552 --> 11:20.012
<i>Kindergarten Policeman</i>.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.555
Are you sure this is a good idea?

11:21.555 --> 11:23.849
Why? What could go Wong?

11:30.314 --> 11:31.357
<i>Oh, Freddy.</i>

11:34.193 --> 11:37.405
These instructions seem simple,
but they were not.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.074
- Hey.
- Yeah?

11:40.074 --> 11:41.534
What do you think?

11:43.994 --> 11:44.995
Uh...

11:45.871 --> 11:48.332
I think the legs are upside-down.

11:48.332 --> 11:52.628
Okay. I've eased the sufferings
of millions, calmed oceans.

11:52.628 --> 11:55.798
I will not be defeated
by Swedish furniture.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.759
Uh-huh.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.720
Are you sure we need all this?

12:02.430 --> 12:04.849
Hey, what's with the face?

12:07.727 --> 12:09.270
Jin's late.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.649
Are you beginning to doubt your guide?

12:15.192 --> 12:16.277
No.

12:17.319 --> 12:18.362
He'll come.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.614
I know he will.

12:20.614 --> 12:23.409
Jin! Jin! Jin! Jin! Jin! Jin!

12:23.409 --> 12:25.536
Dude, you're killing it.
That's five. Keep going.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.831
No-- Mmm. I'm not gonna do--
I gotta get some water.

12:28.831 --> 12:32.960
I didn't even think he was
gonna get two, but that's Jin with five!

12:34.336 --> 12:36.714
Okay. All right.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.549
Somebody record this, huh?

12:38.549 --> 12:40.634
- Three, two, one, go!
- Okay.

12:40.634 --> 12:44.054
Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry!

12:44.054 --> 12:45.473
Hey.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.350
Do you think that
there are any hot dogs left at this party?

12:48.934 --> 12:50.436
Hey, yeah, uh--

12:50.936 --> 12:52.146
I feel like if you--

12:52.146 --> 12:54.523
if you just turned me upside-down
and just gently shook me,

12:54.523 --> 12:56.442
three would probably just fall
onto the floor.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.819
- Congrats on making the team.
- Thank you.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.905
Oh, and I wanted to tell you,
good luck tonight.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.281
They do this thing every year,

13:02.281 --> 13:04.450
but I really, really think
you're gonna be fine.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.993
Do what every year?

13:11.957 --> 13:13.375
Wait, do what ev...

13:20.841 --> 13:22.468
Her son is at Stanford.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.928
- Wonderful.
- Mmm.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.304
What major?

13:25.304 --> 13:26.680
Art history.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.476
Good thing she has two sons.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.438
Everything okay? Does that hurt?

13:34.438 --> 13:35.689
Just my arthritis.

13:35.689 --> 13:40.069
I have something for you. It's herbal.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.238
I'm fine. No big deal.

13:42.822 --> 13:47.326
It's okay.
I have a whole case. I'll give you some.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.703
Fine. But I'll pay you.

13:49.703 --> 13:53.332
Don't be silly. I'll go get it.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.420
If I can be honest with you guys,

13:58.420 --> 14:01.006
sometimes I do log in
to an alt account late at night

14:01.006 --> 14:03.092
and like my own posts.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.427
Okay. Cool.
Thanks for sharing, Barry.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.847
Uh, Jin.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.015
- You are up next.
- Me?

14:10.015 --> 14:12.726
Don't be nervous, bro. We're just trying
to learn about the new teammates.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.270
All right.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.647
- All right, rapid-fire. Are you ready?
- Uh, sure.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.482
Okay, who is, uh, your favorite player?

14:18.482 --> 14:20.401
Uh, Messi.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.903
- Hmm. Basic, but hard to disagree.
- Yeah.

14:22.903 --> 14:26.156
- You speak any other languages?
- Uh, little bit of Chinese and--

14:26.156 --> 14:29.410
- I also know all the words to "Despacito."
- That counts.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.120
- Siblings?
- Nah, it's just me.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.037
Dog?

14:32.037 --> 14:35.207
Uh, mom won't let me have one,
I'm allergic to cats, birds freak me out.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.333
What do your parents do?

14:36.333 --> 14:40.629
My dad's a computer engineer,
and my mom does just, like, church stuff.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.172
Um, least favorite food?

14:42.172 --> 14:44.550
Uh, root beer. It-- It makes me gag.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.093
- Huh. Hobbies?
- That's--

14:46.093 --> 14:48.679
Not really. [stammers] Soccer.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.807
No, aren't you into, like--
like, comics and stuff?

14:52.474 --> 14:55.394
Well, yeah. Well-- I mean, yes,
but when I was, like, five.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.938
And I also had a killer coin collection, so...

14:57.938 --> 14:59.857
Cool.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.692
All right, last question.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.360
Who are you crushing on right now?

15:03.360 --> 15:04.737
Mmm.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.072
Dude, it's, like,
the second week of school, man.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.490
- Gotta answer, bro.
- Come on.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.660
I don't know, dude. Um...

15:15.831 --> 15:18.459
- Ooh!
- Oh. Yeah.

15:19.710 --> 15:20.711
Amelia?

15:21.545 --> 15:23.631
Yeah, you know? I don't know, she's cute.

15:23.631 --> 15:24.715
It's good to have dreams.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.468
Yeah, who knows?
Maybe she's into shy mumbling.

15:29.219 --> 15:30.596
All right, Cooper. You're up.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.098
All right, uh, is it true
you take meds for your BO?

15:33.098 --> 15:35.309
'Cause if not, please do.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.811
'Cause that's like--
You know that's happening, right?

15:40.272 --> 15:45.152
Can I present to you,
your new coffee table?

15:50.240 --> 15:51.075
Wei-Chen.

15:51.075 --> 15:54.244
Are you sure this boy
is who you think he is?

15:54.870 --> 15:57.665
Yes. I believe in him.

15:57.665 --> 16:02.002
Or maybe you're just
searching for a friend.

16:04.672 --> 16:05.756
Maybe.

16:07.758 --> 16:11.637
You know, on second thoughts,

16:11.637 --> 16:14.223
if you truly believe in this Jin...

16:14.223 --> 16:16.016
...you should go find him.

16:16.892 --> 16:17.935
What? Really?

16:17.935 --> 16:20.354
Mm-hmm. Perhaps he's lost.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.189
But I thought you said he was a--

16:22.189 --> 16:23.607
- Mmm, mm-mmm. Go. Uh-uh.
- Go--

16:23.607 --> 16:26.819
But be careful.
Especially with that staff.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.862
Okay. Thank you.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.449
I'll bring him here
to speak with you.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.220
Hey, Travis, thanks for inviting me, man,
but I think I'm gonna head out.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.973
Hey, no problem,
but don't leave yet, okay?

16:56.807 --> 16:58.767
- Hey, everybody!
- Quiet down, guys!

16:58.767 --> 17:02.187
As we know, tonight is a very big night.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.189
We had some fun meeting our new teammates,

17:04.189 --> 17:06.066
but now it's time for them
to prove themselves.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.651
It's the Chump Run!

17:12.489 --> 17:17.828
This year's new chumps are Barry,
Cooper, Austin and Jin.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.205
Boys, take your phones out.

17:20.205 --> 17:23.500
For the rest of the night,
whatever we text, you gotta do,

17:23.500 --> 17:26.503
with photo evidence within three hours.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.630
Fail to complete the tasks
or run out of time,

17:28.630 --> 17:31.925
you'll be wearing a jockstrap
on the outside of your shorts for a week.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.178
The lucky chump who goes above and beyond,

17:34.178 --> 17:36.472
- they get... the golden cleats!
- Yeah!

17:36.472 --> 17:38.974
Yeah! Whoo!

17:40.893 --> 17:43.103
The Chump Run
is about loyalty, dedication,

17:43.103 --> 17:47.316
and proving to us that you'll do
whatever it takes to be on this team.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.443
And now that we know
a little bit more about you,

17:49.443 --> 17:51.862
well, it's gonna suck that much more.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.280
Get to running, chumps.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.449
'Cause tonight, we own you.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.409
Ooh. Yeah.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.412
Come on.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.084
- Get ready, chumps.
- ...everything.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.156
Niu Mowang.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.202
It's good to see you.

18:40.994 --> 18:41.995
In sweatpants.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.041
So, what brings you here?

18:46.041 --> 18:48.877
You know, shopping trip.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.254
Good deal hunting.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.421
Mmm.

18:51.421 --> 18:54.007
Me too... [chuckles] ...in a way.

18:54.007 --> 18:57.052
But I'm hunting
for something quite different,

18:57.928 --> 19:01.306
something I heard was stolen from Wukong
by his very own son.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.977
You wouldn't know where
I might be able to find that, would you?

19:04.977 --> 19:07.604
I really don't want to hurt you.

19:08.438 --> 19:12.276
That's very merciful,
Goddess of Mercy.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.989
Why don't you join our uprising?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.283
Help us bring about a new era of change.

19:19.283 --> 19:22.077
You don't want change, Mowang.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.580
You want power.

19:24.580 --> 19:28.458
You and I both know that Heaven
is a broken system far beyond repair.

19:29.168 --> 19:33.046
If you have grievances,
request an audience with the Jade Emperor.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.173
He will listen.

19:37.718 --> 19:41.430
I learned long ago
that requests get you nowhere.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.558
No one gives you anything.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.854
You have to just take.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.274
Look at you.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.735
All pumped up.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.614
Take a look at yourself.

20:01.575 --> 20:02.826
It's just a mirror.

20:02.826 --> 20:05.329
Enough with the games, Guanyin.

20:06.246 --> 20:08.123
Just tell me where the boy is.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.170
Why so mad?

20:13.170 --> 20:16.340
Is it me? Or your own reflection?

20:26.183 --> 20:27.935
Not my coffee table.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.718
Go away.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.885
You win, Guanyin. For now.

21:43.885 --> 21:47.222
But once I get that Staff,

21:47.222 --> 21:49.975
it won't be so easy to stop me.

21:49.975 --> 21:50.976
Mmm.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.186
Do what you need to do.

21:53.937 --> 21:56.148
Just don't mess with my boy.

22:25.093 --> 22:27.304
One scoop in water, not tea.

22:27.304 --> 22:31.725
Helps tension, headaches, fatigue...

22:31.725 --> 22:33.518
Could it help my ankles?

22:34.478 --> 22:35.437
I don't see why not.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.688
Maybe I should take two bottles.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.566
I'm keeping some for my family...

22:40.567 --> 22:43.278
...but I can ask the herbalist for more.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.447
Tell her to put me down for two.

22:45.447 --> 22:47.449
- Me too.
- Okay. I should write this down.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.493
I can pay you now. Let me get my purse.

22:50.952 --> 22:54.831
Just don't tell anyone, okay?

22:54.831 --> 22:56.625
The herbalist makes it by hand.

22:56.625 --> 22:57.751
It's hard work.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.088
What's that you're talking about?

23:07.636 --> 23:10.472
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey. Uh, I need a huge favor.

23:10.472 --> 23:13.642
<i>I'm still at school.
We had a cosplay club meeting. What's up?</i>

23:13.642 --> 23:15.727
- Right, yeah, I know. I'm outside.
-<i>What?</i>

23:20.232 --> 23:22.651
Hey. Uh, I didn't know who else to ask.
It's for soccer.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.694
You need my help with soccer?

23:24.694 --> 23:27.697
"Chump Run task number one,
you must wear something stupid.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.241
The stupider the better."

23:30.242 --> 23:31.660
You came to the right place.

23:39.626 --> 23:40.710
Thanks.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.879
Yeah? Uh, anytime.

23:42.879 --> 23:45.924
For the record, in my mind I was picturing
an ugly sweater or something.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.467
I know.

23:47.467 --> 23:50.011
Oh, careful with the tail, by the way.
My mom custom made it.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.306
Let's do this thing.

24:36.933 --> 24:39.060
Hey! Hey, stop running.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.022
Get over here!

25:11.801 --> 25:13.762
Hey, Julie!
Tuesday Bible study, huh?

25:13.762 --> 25:15.889
- Okay, yeah.
- See you later.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.478
Oh, hello, Pastor Mike!

25:21.478 --> 25:23.522
It's been a long time.
Where have you been?

25:23.522 --> 25:26.066
- Our sister church.
- Good to see you.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.692
How are you?

25:27.692 --> 25:29.319
Jin!

25:29.319 --> 25:33.281
Uh-- Shh. Wei-Chen?
What are you doing here?

25:33.281 --> 25:34.741
I've been looking for you.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.577
Is this how you worship?

25:37.577 --> 25:39.913
What? No, um--

25:40.413 --> 25:41.623
Listen, I'm really sorry.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.375
I was gonna come find you and your aunt,

25:43.375 --> 25:45.544
but, uh, I gotta do
this Chump Run thing first.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.379
What is a chump run?

25:47.379 --> 25:50.006
It's just, like, a series of tasks
that I gotta do for soccer.

25:50.006 --> 25:52.467
Right now I gotta steal a bunch
of toilet paper from my mom's church.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.969
Toilet papers?

25:53.969 --> 25:58.557
Yeah, it's a fun bonding activity. Plus,
if I don't do it, they're gonna punish me.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.558
Who's gonna punish you?

25:59.558 --> 26:01.351
I can't really explain
'cause I gotta figure out

26:01.351 --> 26:04.437
how to wrap a 15-foot statue
in toilet paper in the next hour, so...

26:05.647 --> 26:10.944
Jin, if I help you,
will you come meet my guardian?

26:10.944 --> 26:12.821
Yeah, dude. Definitely.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.907
Okay, then we're gonna need
some more toilet papers.

26:23.790 --> 26:24.916
Melly.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.626
Melly. Oh!

26:26.626 --> 26:28.920
Hi, Mrs. Wang. I was just closing up.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.005
Here, for you.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.339
What's this?

26:31.339 --> 26:33.717
Money for your grandma.

26:33.717 --> 26:37.095
I bought the herbal powder for myself,
but I sold it at church.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.515
Wait, really?
You sold a whole case in one day?

26:40.515 --> 26:41.725
Mmm.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.393
Here, you should take a cut.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.729
No, no. It's not necessary.

26:45.729 --> 26:46.813
Of course, it is.

26:46.813 --> 26:49.316
That's how my band works.
We split everything 12 ways.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.610
Melly, your grandma helped me so much.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.111
I just want to help.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.530
That's really sweet, Mrs. Wang.

26:55.530 --> 26:59.909
But, honestly, we need to make, like,
a hundred times this to even make a dent.

27:02.370 --> 27:05.498
Well, do you have more
of the herbal powder?

27:05.498 --> 27:07.584
Yeah. Like, a lot more.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.378
Why?

27:12.797 --> 27:14.507
Is everything okay, Mrs. Wang?

27:15.050 --> 27:17.552
Yeah. My headache is gone.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.438
Isn't that the stupidest bear
you've ever seen?

27:28.438 --> 27:29.731
How are we gonna do this?

27:29.731 --> 27:32.692
Well, earlier you asked me
how I found you.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.739
- This is my Uber.
- With a toothpick?

27:43.244 --> 27:45.872
Whoa! [chuckles] Okay.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.207
Oh, my God. Uh--

27:47.207 --> 27:51.294
Are you, like, allowed to use that thing
for stuff like this, or...

27:51.294 --> 27:52.420
Yes.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.797
Okay.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.298
Come on! Throw me one.

27:55.298 --> 27:57.008
Oh-- Uh... Oh, oh, okay.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.511
You want me to just, like, toss it?

28:00.345 --> 28:02.597
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- All right, here it comes. Ready?

28:06.810 --> 28:08.353
Wow. God.

28:08.353 --> 28:11.022
Whoo-hoo! [chuckles] Dude.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.399
Come on, come one! Another one!

28:15.318 --> 28:17.529
- Are you serious, right now?
- Whoo!

28:18.697 --> 28:19.614
Hey!

28:20.573 --> 28:21.950
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

28:21.950 --> 28:24.160
Wei-Chen, is-- is that kung fu?

28:25.537 --> 28:27.122
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.626
- Yeah.
- Let's do this.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.464
Whoo-hoo.

28:36.464 --> 28:37.924
Dude.

28:37.924 --> 28:40.009
Oh, my God!

28:40.844 --> 28:43.722
Dude! Dude!

28:43.722 --> 28:46.182
This is so freaking unbelievable.

28:46.182 --> 28:49.310
Yeah. I should do this
to Jade Emperor's palace.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.521
Yeah, you should! Whatever that means.

28:51.521 --> 28:55.692
Oh, oh, uh,
I gotta get a selfie, so...

28:56.651 --> 28:58.987
- Uh, okay.
- Yeah. I just gotta--

29:00.405 --> 29:01.948
Here, get in on this, um--

29:02.991 --> 29:04.200
Okay?

29:08.037 --> 29:09.414
Oh, my God.

29:10.790 --> 29:14.878
So, um, do you believe me now?

29:15.462 --> 29:19.215
About where I come from?
And about the quest?

29:20.383 --> 29:22.385
Yeah, dude. I do.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.763
Yeah? Okay.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.557
Come with me.

29:27.557 --> 29:29.142
Oh, oh. Uh, one sec.

29:30.685 --> 29:33.313
Oh.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.397
What's that?

29:36.608 --> 29:38.109
That means they liked it.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.653
That means
they really freaking liked it.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.159
Jin. Just, um, go to your friends.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.369
Yeah, we can talk more tomorrow.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.246
Uh, are you sure?

29:50.246 --> 29:52.415
Yeah, just go. Come on. Yeah.

29:53.041 --> 29:56.044
Okay. Um... Thanks.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.629
I really appreciate that.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.965
And, listen,
I'm gonna help you find it, okay?

30:00.965 --> 30:03.384
The-- The whatever it is
that you're looking for.

30:03.384 --> 30:04.803
It's the Fourth Scroll, right?

30:04.803 --> 30:07.138
- Uh, yeah. Really?
- Yeah.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.973
- Thank you. Jin, thank you.
- Yes, definitely, dude.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.142
No, dude, thank you.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.686
Um, okay, see you later?

30:14.771 --> 30:16.523
- Yeah.
- Okay.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.649
God.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.275
I'll catch you later, all right?

30:19.275 --> 30:20.360
Bye!

30:22.737 --> 30:25.448
So this is what you came here for.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.788
Give it back.
That doesn't belong to you.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.498
It never belonged to your father either.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.751
I was curious why you stole it.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.712
The Fourth Scroll, huh?

30:46.386 --> 30:49.848
Niu Mowang, please.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.852
You've been very helpful tonight.

31:15.915 --> 31:18.042
Jin-<i>ah</i>, why so late?

31:18.042 --> 31:21.921
Uh, it's just soccer stuff.
It's not gonna be like this every night.

31:21.921 --> 31:23.006
Okay.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.216
Good day?

31:25.717 --> 31:27.093
Yeah.

31:27.093 --> 31:28.428
It's a great day, actually.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.555
Me too.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.107
124, 125...

32:17.268 --> 32:20.313
Wei-Chen, I told you
to take care of the Staff.

32:20.313 --> 32:22.148
It's not a toy.

32:26.736 --> 32:27.904
Who else knows?

32:38.539 --> 32:39.916
Time to go home.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.501
Before you make things worse.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.044
Take it easy on the boy--

32:43.044 --> 32:44.462
Enough advice from you.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.839
He's caused enough trouble.

32:47.423 --> 32:50.802
I'm sorry. You had faith in me.

32:52.011 --> 32:53.888
I let you down.

32:57.809 --> 33:00.144
It doesn't matter
if you let me down,

33:00.812 --> 33:03.731
it only matters if you let yourself down.

33:05.483 --> 33:06.818
Wait a minute.

33:09.612 --> 33:12.365
Fried rice. We ordered too much, as usual.

33:13.950 --> 33:14.993
Let's go.
