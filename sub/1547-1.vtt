01:50.893 --> 01:54.852
And welcome to
the 38th annual NBA All-Star game...

01:54.963 --> 01:56.692
from Chicago Stadium.

01:56.799 --> 01:58.699
A standing-room-only crowd.

01:58.801 --> 02:03.238
A steal by Jordan.
He spun it away from the Mailman.

02:16.918 --> 02:19.386
Just needs a little time-out to reorganize.

02:19.487 --> 02:22.456
And the chances
of a West comeback are slipping away.

02:24.425 --> 02:26.450
Aguirre for three.

02:26.561 --> 02:28.927
I have never seen an All-Star game...

02:29.030 --> 02:31.624
that had such spectacular passing...

02:31.732 --> 02:33.893
and plays,
and thundering plays like this.

02:34.001 --> 02:36.401
They're beginning to hang, Billy.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.939
Ah, what a way to end this ball game.

02:54.988 --> 02:58.389
Right now, I wanna, you know,
play in the NBA...

02:58.491 --> 03:01.585
like anybody else would wanna be.

03:02.629 --> 03:04.893
That's who -
That's something...

03:04.998 --> 03:07.660
I dream and think
about all the time -

03:07.767 --> 03:09.666
playing in the NBA.

03:15.608 --> 03:17.940
He's just doing something
that he loves so much.

03:18.978 --> 03:22.709
He just love it so much.
I'm just happy for him.

03:22.815 --> 03:24.715
If somebody can understand
the way William play...

03:24.817 --> 03:27.377
that'll make me feel
a lot better.

03:27.486 --> 03:30.421
The way they should have
understood the way I played.

03:38.696 --> 03:42.359
This Chicagoan
is making his seventh All-Star appearance.

03:42.467 --> 03:44.992
From the Detroit Pistons, 6'1 "...

03:45.103 --> 03:47.731
Isaiah Thomas!

03:50.241 --> 03:52.232
When I get in the NBA...

03:52.343 --> 03:55.278
the first thing I'm gonna do...

03:55.380 --> 03:59.009
I'm gonna see my mama, buy her a house...

03:59.117 --> 04:02.553
I'm gonna go there and make sure
my sister and my brother's okay.

04:02.654 --> 04:04.986
If we were okay or not.

04:05.089 --> 04:07.716
Probably get my dad...

04:07.824 --> 04:09.815
a Cadillac Oldsmobile...

04:09.927 --> 04:11.895
so he can cruise in the games.

04:11.995 --> 04:13.690
Something real long.

04:13.797 --> 04:15.856
Dominique.! Ooh.!

04:16.966 --> 04:19.935
He dreams about it.

04:20.036 --> 04:22.301
He look at those
basketball commercials...

04:22.406 --> 04:25.204
where they be advertising these Nike shoes?

04:25.309 --> 04:27.368
He'll tell his little, small brother...

04:27.477 --> 04:29.377
"Joe, Joe, that's me."

04:29.479 --> 04:33.813
So the West leads.
Thomas trying to go the distance. Loses it.

04:43.592 --> 04:47.221
I don't even think about
it, if he don't make it.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.628
Just 'cause I'm so -

04:49.732 --> 04:51.825
I'm so, you know,
focused in on him making it.

04:51.934 --> 04:53.834
I just know he'll make it.

05:30.038 --> 05:35.100
I'm off to Central...

05:35.209 --> 05:37.177
and the Congress
Expressway-

05:37.277 --> 05:41.236
a park over there where there are
some pretty talented young men.

05:41.348 --> 05:45.682
Earl Smith works downtown
as an insurance executive.

05:45.786 --> 05:49.882
On weekends he's an unofficial talent scout
for several area high schools.

05:55.562 --> 05:57.757
This is what you call
"beating the bushes."

05:57.865 --> 06:00.766
This is the job
of most of your freshmen coaches...

06:00.868 --> 06:04.963
and guys like me who -
who played a little bit of the game...

06:05.071 --> 06:08.563
who love trying to help young people
on the road to success.

06:10.643 --> 06:12.543
It's in! It's in!

06:14.347 --> 06:18.215
Today Earl spots Arthur Agee,
who just graduated from grammar school.

06:19.285 --> 06:22.880
He's got the quickest first step
that I've seen in about five years.

06:22.989 --> 06:24.889
His first step.

06:28.761 --> 06:32.457
I will bet you a steak dinner
in four years you'll be hearing from him.

06:32.564 --> 06:34.998
I don't even know anything about him.

06:49.881 --> 06:51.729
Several days later,

06:51.730 --> 06:53.578
Earl takes Arthur and his family
on a recruiting visit...

06:53.685 --> 06:57.121
to the high school
where NBA star Isiah Thomas played.

06:57.222 --> 06:59.247
The visit will give
St. Joseph's coaches...

06:59.357 --> 07:01.347
a chance to see Arthur perform.

07:10.301 --> 07:12.826
Your role today, Arthur...

07:12.937 --> 07:15.929
is to impress the coaches.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.065
Try not to be too fancy.

07:18.175 --> 07:20.643
Take the open shot when you have it.

07:21.679 --> 07:24.648
Play good defense
and make good passes.

07:24.748 --> 07:27.308
The rest of it,
just play natural, you know.

07:28.953 --> 07:32.820
I'm hoping I'm gonna go to St. Joe
and play...

07:32.922 --> 07:37.086
but first I gotta -
I gotta get my books straight.

07:37.193 --> 07:39.684
And...

07:39.796 --> 07:43.254
hopefully come out
and impress the coaches.

07:44.834 --> 07:47.701
Is it kinda scary?

07:47.804 --> 07:49.772
Yes, it is.

07:52.675 --> 07:56.304
I've never been to a school
way out before...

07:56.412 --> 08:00.643
and I would be going to a school
with different kids, different races.

08:02.518 --> 08:06.648
You can look at the scenery,
new friends to meet.

08:10.025 --> 08:12.255
What if Isiah's there today?

08:15.297 --> 08:18.095
Well, if he be there...

08:19.201 --> 08:21.328
I'll be shocked...

08:21.436 --> 08:23.961
'cause that'd be my first time
ever seeing him...

08:24.072 --> 08:26.768
Up close, you know, real life.

08:32.712 --> 08:36.547
Basketball has to be second
to your academics.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.710
If you don't get your grades,
you're not gonna play.

08:38.818 --> 08:43.347
If you work hard at the grades,
and if you work hard at basketball...

08:43.457 --> 08:46.255
then I would be able to help you
as far as going to college.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.328
And I guarantee this.

08:48.429 --> 08:51.830
I can't promise you where you're gonna go
and if you're gonna be a star...

08:51.933 --> 08:55.926
but I guarantee that I would help you
get into the school...

08:56.037 --> 08:58.527
that would be best for you.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.936
I'm making a commitment to you...

09:01.041 --> 09:04.067
if you make a commitment
to being part of this kind of a program.

09:09.849 --> 09:13.444
Out of all of the kids
at the St. Joseph Basketball Camp...

09:13.553 --> 09:16.579
there are a few like Arthur
that Coach Pingatore is recruiting.

09:20.527 --> 09:23.724
It was like million of guys
trying to be better than the other...

09:23.830 --> 09:27.321
but, to me,
I was better than all of them...

09:27.433 --> 09:29.901
except Isiah.

09:30.002 --> 09:34.496
It gives me great pleasure to introduce
to you a graduate of St. Joe's...

09:34.607 --> 09:37.167
high school all-American...

09:37.276 --> 09:40.768
All-American from Indiana University...

09:40.879 --> 09:43.109
five-time NBA All-Star...

09:43.215 --> 09:45.410
Isiah Thomas.

09:45.517 --> 09:49.351
Hello. How are you?

09:49.455 --> 09:53.653
In everybody's neighborhood,
there's a guy who can really play.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.658
He can shoot the lights out.

09:55.760 --> 09:59.355
Every time down the court -
Swish, swish, swish!

09:59.464 --> 10:02.627
Then he goes to St. Joseph high School...

10:02.734 --> 10:05.760
and the guy gets cut.

10:05.870 --> 10:09.931
You say, "But Tom was real good.
Why did he get cut?'"

10:10.041 --> 10:13.738
See, Tom didn't learn
the fundamentals of team basketball...

10:13.845 --> 10:16.313
which is what you're learning
how to play.

10:31.328 --> 10:33.796
He told my daddy
that he knew I could play...

10:33.897 --> 10:35.831
so he just had to play me hard.

10:51.882 --> 10:55.715
I can see the playground in him.
I can see talent.

10:55.818 --> 10:58.116
But I don't see the confidence.

11:02.692 --> 11:06.184
With Isiah, I just knew
he was gonna be a great one.

11:06.295 --> 11:11.198
He had that total combination
of personality, confidence, talent...

11:11.300 --> 11:13.359
intelligence.

11:13.469 --> 11:17.735
I think I see it in one kid
that's coming here.

11:17.840 --> 11:22.208
He flows with a smoothness
and confidence...

11:22.310 --> 11:24.210
and strength...

11:24.312 --> 11:26.837
that you don't see in every kid.

11:26.948 --> 11:30.008
But he could become a great player.

11:39.994 --> 11:43.521
You gotta take a shot.
Always work it. You can't block it.

11:48.603 --> 11:50.730
Ohh.!

11:50.839 --> 11:52.965
I just bang him and bruise him.

11:53.073 --> 11:56.338
I'm trying to let him know right now
you gonna get hit, get knocked down...

11:56.443 --> 11:59.412
you gonna get banged around,
so you better get used to it now.

12:00.581 --> 12:02.549
Stop it. One-hand hook.

12:04.318 --> 12:07.913
All these basketball dreams I had,
they gone.

12:08.021 --> 12:11.286
All I see -All my dreams in him now.

12:11.392 --> 12:14.122
I want him to make it so bad,
I don't know what to do.

12:16.196 --> 12:19.654
They want to play basketball
and stuff, that was always okay.

12:20.933 --> 12:24.630
But I was gonna make sure all of 'em
got through high school.

12:24.737 --> 12:28.730
A high school diploma
was very important to me.

12:32.712 --> 12:36.842
My mother,
she was like mother and father to me.

12:36.949 --> 12:41.648
She don't want me really
hanging around over here that much...

12:41.754 --> 12:43.722
'cause of the gangs.

12:44.957 --> 12:47.255
I feel if I go to St. Joseph...

12:47.360 --> 12:50.453
I'll at least get a good chance
to go to a good college.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.894
That would be good for me.

13:02.641 --> 13:04.632
That was my first son.

13:05.744 --> 13:09.180
I said, "That's Daddy's man, '"
so we just started calling him "Man. '"

13:09.281 --> 13:11.249
Get around it!

13:12.784 --> 13:14.945
I could have been a good college player.

13:15.053 --> 13:18.681
Most likely
I would have made it to the pros.

13:18.789 --> 13:21.622
But, you know, once I had my son...

13:21.725 --> 13:24.353
I knew then something good
was gonna come out of it.

13:24.462 --> 13:26.726
I think the talent gonna be passed on.

13:33.103 --> 13:37.540
He told me, "I'm so scared of growing up."
I said, "Why?"

13:37.641 --> 13:41.668
he said a grown-up has so many problems.
"I got so many things on my mind."

13:41.779 --> 13:44.441
I just want Arthur to have more...

13:44.548 --> 13:46.914
you know,
have a better life than what I had.

13:47.017 --> 13:50.315
I don't want him experiencing
bad things that I went through in life.

14:30.459 --> 14:34.156
Austin Boulevard
will be the next stop. Austin is next.

14:34.263 --> 14:36.322
Like Isiah Thomas before them...

14:36.431 --> 14:39.559
both Arthur and William make
a three-hour round trip each day...

14:39.668 --> 14:42.569
between the city and St. Joseph's.

14:42.671 --> 14:45.468
That was strange for me
going out to a far-out school.

14:45.573 --> 14:50.203
I saw a rug, flowers, clean hallways...

14:50.311 --> 14:53.439
things that I didn't see
in an ordinary school.

15:17.470 --> 15:20.496
Gotta move! Gotta move!

15:20.607 --> 15:22.507
Come on.

15:24.945 --> 15:26.845
- Three, four, five or 10?
- Ten.

15:26.947 --> 15:28.881
You got it. Three, four, five?

15:28.982 --> 15:32.645
Arthur wins the starting
point-guard position on the freshmen team.

15:32.752 --> 15:37.280
Agee, I want you to find
in that warm-up number two.

15:37.390 --> 15:39.620
Brown, number three.

15:39.726 --> 15:42.217
Ettmeyer, four.

15:42.329 --> 15:46.128
Hey, Arthur, you know
if you miss free throws...

15:46.231 --> 15:48.699
they count 'em up,
and you have to pay 15 cents.

15:48.801 --> 15:50.598
Then if you don't pay
it, they gonna make you

15:50.599 --> 15:52.396
run 50 laps, and still
you have to pay the money.

15:52.504 --> 15:55.473
- You still gotta pay the money?
- That's way out.

16:00.679 --> 16:04.012
When Arthur first started at St.
Joseph's...

16:04.116 --> 16:06.482
he was a good kid,
from what we saw...

16:06.585 --> 16:08.883
but he was very immature.

16:08.988 --> 16:11.548
He might have been a little more
disruptive, speaking out...

16:11.657 --> 16:13.749
getting into childish things.

16:15.827 --> 16:18.694
He wasn't used to the discipline
and the control.

16:18.796 --> 16:22.232
He reverted back to, maybe,
his environment, where he came from.

16:24.802 --> 16:28.704
I just never been around
a lot of white people and...

16:28.806 --> 16:33.106
it was different, because at a black school
I could associate with the people.

16:33.211 --> 16:35.145
They talk the way I talk.

16:35.246 --> 16:38.977
It was a little hard,
but I can adjust to it.

16:40.485 --> 16:43.510
You can see there was talent there.

16:43.620 --> 16:46.350
We kept saying up in the stands,
"Get the ball to Arthur...

16:46.456 --> 16:48.754
because he's going to do it for you. '"

16:48.859 --> 16:51.521
And sure enough, they gave him the ball
with seconds on the clock.

16:59.803 --> 17:03.136
I noticed a change immediately
after he started going out there.

17:03.240 --> 17:07.506
To see your child mature, you say,
"Oh, maybe this is good for him."

17:20.790 --> 17:24.351
William begins
his freshman season on St. Joe's varsity...

17:24.460 --> 17:26.451
the top-ranked squad in the state.

17:35.738 --> 17:38.263
He's already received several letters...

17:38.374 --> 17:40.773
from Division I schools -

17:40.875 --> 17:44.470
Marquette and Rice and Creighton,
Illinois State...

17:44.579 --> 17:46.479
to name a few.

17:50.051 --> 17:53.077
Beat him! Beat him! Beat him!
Keep back!

17:56.725 --> 18:00.684
Hold it up! hold it up!
You're killing us!

18:00.795 --> 18:03.263
Why did he get to the ball before you?

18:04.866 --> 18:08.426
He asks me, do I wanna be
a great player? And I keep saying yeah.

18:08.535 --> 18:11.504
He said, "For four years,
I'm gonna be on you every day."

18:11.605 --> 18:14.597
So he said, "You might as well
get used to it now."

18:14.708 --> 18:17.939
hard left. No, no. Go hard left.

18:18.045 --> 18:22.004
Right, I know you can do it.
Left, you can't. All right? Go hard.

18:23.650 --> 18:26.278
Not bad. Do it again.

18:31.692 --> 18:34.320
If you look at Matthew,
and again he's saying...

18:34.428 --> 18:37.624
at the time the kingdom of heaven
will be like this.

18:37.730 --> 18:40.563
This is how Matthew's gonna use Jesus.
This is how he's gonna start it out.

18:40.666 --> 18:44.102
What this is saying
is you have to take the faith-

18:44.203 --> 18:47.536
When I first came out here,
it was, like, "I wanna go home.

18:47.640 --> 18:50.609
Is this really the right school for me?'"

18:50.710 --> 18:54.612
But every little thing you do
that go against their rule...

18:54.714 --> 18:56.705
you have detention.

18:56.816 --> 18:59.717
And they'll suspend you quick
at the school too.

18:59.819 --> 19:01.719
They'll suspend you quick.

19:01.821 --> 19:04.619
The kids that are willing to do it...

19:05.758 --> 19:07.554
are gonna take something away

19:07.555 --> 19:09.352
that will help them for
the rest of their life.

19:09.461 --> 19:12.225
The kids that are not willing to do it...

19:12.330 --> 19:14.457
for whatever reason, uh...

19:14.566 --> 19:16.796
are not gonna be very successful
as far as here.

19:16.902 --> 19:20.770
The civil rights movement
started up in the '50s.

19:20.872 --> 19:23.070
When William first entered St. Joe's...

19:23.075 --> 19:26.403
tests revealed he was working
on a fourth or fifth-grade level.

19:27.813 --> 19:30.373
I could see that he had the potential...

19:30.482 --> 19:34.077
but because he was shy, it seemed as though
no one was trying to reach him.

19:35.786 --> 19:39.688
Sister Marilyn told me,
"You have to be one good ballplayer...

19:39.790 --> 19:42.281
to get in this school with these grades. '"

19:42.393 --> 19:45.055
- What war beginning in the '60s?
- Vietnam.

19:45.162 --> 19:49.292
At the end of the year,
he had gone four grades above...

19:49.400 --> 19:52.699
just in the way he listened and learned.

19:55.973 --> 19:57.873
Back in grammar school...

19:57.975 --> 20:01.035
academics really didn't matter
too much to me at all.

20:03.113 --> 20:07.481
It was playing ball for the team-
really, we was the standouts in the school.

20:07.584 --> 20:10.644
If you showed up in class,
that was good enough for them.

20:10.753 --> 20:13.745
I was just going to school for the girls.

20:13.857 --> 20:15.825
Trip out with your friends...

20:15.925 --> 20:19.053
get out, go play some more basketball.

20:19.162 --> 20:21.756
That was basically it.

20:25.401 --> 20:29.770
Arthur also entered St. Joe's
on a fourth or fifth-grade level.

20:29.873 --> 20:33.706
Nobody in their right mind
is crazy about school.

20:33.809 --> 20:35.743
If the president brought
up a thing right now

20:35.744 --> 20:37.677
that say, "Close all schools"...

20:37.779 --> 20:41.215
do you think any kids would be trying
to go out there, stand on a picket line...

20:41.316 --> 20:45.275
and wave and get billboards...

20:45.387 --> 20:47.685
saying, "Reopen schools"?

20:47.789 --> 20:50.451
Nice and tall, guys.
Now, don't look at the flash.

20:50.559 --> 20:53.460
Arthur was in
the lower group of the general program.

20:53.562 --> 20:55.689
Okay, fellas. Good.

20:55.797 --> 20:58.823
At the end of the year,
he was still in the lower group.

20:58.934 --> 21:00.902
One, two, three.!

21:04.071 --> 21:06.938
For Arthur, the season is over.

21:07.041 --> 21:10.204
His freshman team finished second
in the conference.

21:10.311 --> 21:13.838
William's varsity is rolling
through the play-offs.

21:25.660 --> 21:29.892
Against Proviso East,
William plays his best game yet.

21:32.299 --> 21:36.429
And the Chargers move a step closer to
going downstate to compete for the title.

21:41.207 --> 21:44.973
St. Joe's made it downstate
five of the last six years.

21:45.078 --> 21:48.172
The one thing we haven't done
is win a state tournament.

21:49.582 --> 21:54.485
Man, that'd be a big thing
if I could go downstate as a freshman.

21:54.587 --> 21:57.351
Isiah was good enough
to start on the varsity as a freshman.

21:57.457 --> 22:01.756
I didn't do it because I was worried
about bringing him along too rapidly.

22:01.860 --> 22:05.023
I think by not doing it,
it cost us a state championship.

22:09.902 --> 22:14.532
In the sectional finals,
Fenwick challenges St. Joe's title hopes.

22:14.640 --> 22:18.599
But in the second quarter,
William steps up.

22:19.845 --> 22:21.779
With his brother Curtis looking on...

22:21.880 --> 22:25.839
William scores 16 points to lead
the Chargers to the sectional title.

22:28.687 --> 22:33.385
From Chicago, it's The
Sports Writers On TV.

22:33.491 --> 22:37.928
I think I may have seen
the next Isiah Thomas.

22:38.029 --> 22:42.591
St. Joe of Westchester
has a kid named William Gates...

22:42.700 --> 22:45.134
who is starting as a freshman.

22:45.236 --> 22:47.704
Remember, you heard it first
from Bill Gleason.

22:47.805 --> 22:50.740
Put it in your memory banks,
ladies and gentlemen.

22:50.842 --> 22:53.436
William Gates.

22:56.814 --> 23:00.476
In the supersectionals,
St. Joe's meets DeSalles...

23:00.584 --> 23:03.815
to decide who will go downstate.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.036
William plays more like
an intimidated freshman

23:06.037 --> 23:08.152
than a freshman sensation.

23:10.394 --> 23:14.592
Six-nine senior all-American
Eric Anderson dominates St. Joe's.

23:18.402 --> 23:21.997
But in the third quarter,
William takes over again.

23:23.106 --> 23:26.837
He fires over Anderson
and is fouled.

23:29.378 --> 23:31.778
William's 13 points
in the second half...

23:31.881 --> 23:34.179
pull the Chargers to within four.

23:37.853 --> 23:41.380
With less than two minutes to play,
it's a must-score.

23:52.368 --> 23:54.632
St. Joe's jump shot falls short.

24:00.008 --> 24:02.442
Eric Anderson.!

24:18.059 --> 24:20.789
Despite the loss,
William's gutty performance...

24:20.895 --> 24:22.795
bodes well for next year.

24:22.897 --> 24:24.160
There will be an announcement

24:24.161 --> 24:26.093
on ticket sales immediately
following the game.

24:29.970 --> 24:32.768
Rewriting 7,300 times 10...

24:32.873 --> 24:36.536
to the negative fifth
in scientific notation.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.702
Who wants that problem?

24:38.812 --> 24:40.712
- I do.
- Go ahead, William.

24:40.814 --> 24:42.748
- 7.3...
- 7.3...

24:42.850 --> 24:46.081
- times 10 to the third.
- Times 10 to the third times-

24:46.186 --> 24:48.381
- 10 to the negative second.
- Is that good!

24:48.489 --> 24:50.389
Very good.

24:50.491 --> 24:53.426
When I went out there,
I was very intimidated...

24:53.527 --> 24:56.461
'cause I just knew that everybody out there
was just smarter than me.

24:57.497 --> 25:00.227
As the year went on...

25:00.333 --> 25:02.631
and I was making
an "A'"and "B'"honor roll...

25:02.735 --> 25:05.932
I just felt like,
"hey, I'm just as good as them. '"

25:07.340 --> 25:09.638
Now what you have to identify-

25:09.742 --> 25:13.473
Both William and Arthur
have partial scholarships from St. Joe's.

25:13.579 --> 25:16.070
The rest of William's tuition
is paid for by Cycle...

25:16.182 --> 25:18.082
a Cabrini Green organization.

25:18.184 --> 25:21.210
But Cycle can't cover
this year's tuition increase.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.811
I was called on
by Brother Edwin Duprais.

25:24.923 --> 25:27.050
He was trying to raise money
to help kids...

25:27.159 --> 25:29.855
that couldn't otherwise go
to those kind of schools.

25:29.961 --> 25:32.156
It really touched a soft
spot in my heart...

25:32.264 --> 25:36.166
and so I decided that my husband and I
would participate on a personal basis.

25:36.268 --> 25:39.533
William was selected as the kid...

25:39.638 --> 25:42.505
that was able to go to school,
based on our contribution.

25:42.607 --> 25:44.632
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

25:44.743 --> 25:49.043
You played a great game. I want you to
meet our friends Liz Duncan, Tom Paris.

25:49.147 --> 25:51.047
- Nice game.
- William Gates.

25:51.149 --> 25:53.378
With continuing support
from Patricia Wier...

25:53.484 --> 25:56.942
William is assured
that his entire education at St. Joe's...

25:57.054 --> 25:59.284
will be free.

26:03.661 --> 26:06.789
Arthur's family is paying
for half of his tuition...

26:06.897 --> 26:10.355
and the increase comes
at an especially bad time.

26:10.467 --> 26:12.992
Worked for Sara Lee, got laid off.

26:13.103 --> 26:17.369
Uh, worked for Scala's Meat Packing.
Got laid off there. You know.

26:17.474 --> 26:21.068
You look around your house,
you see your food getting low. Okay?

26:21.177 --> 26:26.137
And you got your bills due here,
your bills due there.

26:30.019 --> 26:32.487
I got called down to the office.

26:32.589 --> 26:34.682
Brother Leo wanted to talk to me.

26:34.791 --> 26:38.454
He was telling me about how much,
certain money my mama had to pay...

26:38.561 --> 26:40.620
for me to stay in school.

26:40.730 --> 26:44.188
They say if she don't have it by this time,
you gotta stay out till she pay it.

26:44.300 --> 26:47.292
I was staying out, like,
two and three weeks and stuff.

26:47.403 --> 26:49.927
By the end of the freshman year...

26:50.038 --> 26:54.338
whatever balance there was for
tuition was never taken care of.

26:54.443 --> 26:56.877
Consequently,
going into the sophomore year...

26:56.979 --> 26:59.243
we had the balance
plus the new tuition...

26:59.348 --> 27:02.078
so that it was going to continue
to become a problem.

27:02.184 --> 27:05.585
Whatever scout that they have come out
to these different neighborhoods...

27:05.687 --> 27:08.155
and scout out
these little basketball players...

27:08.257 --> 27:11.693
and get 'em to come to their school
and offer them these scholarships.

27:11.793 --> 27:14.261
Then once they get out there,
the story is totally different.

27:14.263 --> 27:16.019
I was under the impression
that Arthur would

27:16.032 --> 27:17.799
have help as far as
getting to school.

27:17.899 --> 27:20.833
Arthur would have help
in getting his books.

27:20.935 --> 27:23.096
But, see, none of that occur.

27:23.204 --> 27:27.971
Finally, with the Agees
owing $ 1,500 in back payments...

27:28.075 --> 27:31.010
St. Joseph's forced Arthur
to leave the school.

27:33.014 --> 27:36.347
I thought Pingatore and them
would help me out, but -

27:41.322 --> 27:44.052
You have to draw the line
because, as I said...

27:44.158 --> 27:48.116
tuition is something that,
as a school, we depend on...

27:48.228 --> 27:50.458
for 90%% of our revenue.

27:50.563 --> 27:53.589
I guess he thought I wasn't gonna be
that big of a ballplayer.

27:53.700 --> 27:57.136
So why would he just waste
some money on me staying there?

27:57.237 --> 27:59.205
Or, you know, he thought
I wasn't gonna grow.

27:59.306 --> 28:02.867
He kept on saying,
"When are you gonna grow?"

28:02.976 --> 28:04.944
Well, I don't know.

28:06.646 --> 28:10.104
If I had known that all of this
was gonna lead to this...

28:10.216 --> 28:12.946
Arthur would have never went
to St. Joseph's.

28:13.053 --> 28:16.022
I mean, if I had known that he was gonna
have to go through this type of pain...

28:16.122 --> 28:18.021
and myself-the anguish of it...

28:18.123 --> 28:21.752
and then to put him out
in the middle of a school year-

28:51.622 --> 28:54.113
I.D.'s, ladies and gentlemen.

28:55.827 --> 28:57.727
All right. Okay, okay. All right.

28:59.997 --> 29:02.090
Can't take no beepers in here.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.725
Give me my beeper, man.

29:06.104 --> 29:07.901
Mr. Wade, I need to see you
at the front door.

29:08.005 --> 29:11.600
Now where you gonna go?
Your friend go to jail. No beepers in here.

29:11.709 --> 29:13.609
Don't make no scene.

29:13.711 --> 29:16.838
Arthur is accepted
at the public high school near his home.

29:16.947 --> 29:21.646
He's been out of school for two months
and lost a whole semester's credit.

29:23.487 --> 29:25.381
Here you have a youngster caught

29:25.382 --> 29:27.924
in the middle of two
separate school systems.

29:28.024 --> 29:30.322
Had he stayed at St. Joseph's...

29:30.427 --> 29:33.692
he would have been able to receive
credit for that first semester.

29:34.798 --> 29:37.699
Doesn't seem fair,
but then that's the system.

29:39.369 --> 29:40.939
If he was going out there
and he was playing

29:40.952 --> 29:42.532
like they had predicted
him to play...

29:42.639 --> 29:44.538
he wouldn't be at Marshall.

29:44.640 --> 29:47.370
Economics wouldn't have had anything
to do with him not being at St. Joe's.

29:47.476 --> 29:48.846
Somebody would have made some kind of

29:48.847 --> 29:50.809
arrangement, and the kid
would've still been there.

29:50.913 --> 29:54.178
He's not making it like they thought he was
gonna make it on the basketball court...

29:54.283 --> 29:56.217
so he's not there, simple as that.

29:56.318 --> 29:59.082
It doesn't take no brilliant person
to figure that out.

30:03.459 --> 30:07.361
It's mid-season
when Arthur joins the sophomore team.

30:07.463 --> 30:10.864
He was so depressed and devastated,
he just closed himself off in the room.

30:10.966 --> 30:16.369
I would go in there and tell him
every day, "hey, things will look up. '"

30:18.573 --> 30:21.167
Coming off the bench,
Arthur wears number 11...

30:21.276 --> 30:23.403
Isiah Thomas's number.

30:35.256 --> 30:37.724
What kind of techniques were being used...

30:37.826 --> 30:40.852
to take away the freedoms
that had been earned?

30:40.962 --> 30:43.259
- Jeannetta.
- Poll tax.

30:43.363 --> 30:46.560
Poll tax. Okay, Arthur,
what other techniques were used...

30:46.667 --> 30:49.295
to keep black Americans from voting?

30:49.403 --> 30:51.303
Um-

30:51.405 --> 30:53.703
You could almost forget
about his being there.

30:53.807 --> 30:56.367
That's how quiet he really was.

30:56.477 --> 30:59.935
I think the transition
had something to do with it.

31:03.784 --> 31:06.252
In comparing
Marshall high School to St. Joseph...

31:06.353 --> 31:08.287
I don't think
that there is any comparison.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.856
People can afford
to send their children there.

31:10.957 --> 31:14.256
They can afford to put money
into the school.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.294
Once they walk in those doors...

31:16.395 --> 31:19.592
they walk in there to get that diploma
and to go on to college.

31:19.699 --> 31:23.795
Whereas our students,
if they get out of high school...

31:23.903 --> 31:26.667
a lot of them,
it's an accomplishment.

31:26.772 --> 31:30.367
Trinomial. What's this gonna be?
Both of these are what?

31:30.476 --> 31:33.411
If he wanna go back next year...

31:33.513 --> 31:35.811
he gonna go back, if I have to beg.

31:38.417 --> 31:41.874
Because, uh, I wanna help him
with his little dream.

31:47.659 --> 31:51.095
Arthur's mother, Sheila,
has lost her minimum-wage job...

31:51.196 --> 31:53.096
as a nurse's assistant...

31:53.198 --> 31:55.462
because of chronic back pain.

31:58.904 --> 32:01.930
It's just a real hard area
to live in, period.

32:02.040 --> 32:04.508
And as far as raising kids -

32:05.911 --> 32:08.675
kids don't even have a playground
or play area...

32:08.780 --> 32:11.680
anything constructive to do
in the neighborhood.

32:11.782 --> 32:14.910
But you see why half of them
become gangbangers, you know.

32:15.019 --> 32:18.079
Because it's nothing constructive
in the neighborhood for 'em.

32:22.226 --> 32:26.219
So now it's, like, you more or less
got to keep your kids close to you...

32:26.330 --> 32:28.491
and watch 'em at all times.

32:48.551 --> 32:51.782
In June, after 20 years of marriage...

32:51.888 --> 32:54.516
Arthur's dad leaves the family.

33:11.673 --> 33:15.973
Big logjam into the lane.
Jordan's 15-footer good from out front.

33:16.078 --> 33:19.241
Make sure you look at
how many shots have been taken.

33:19.348 --> 33:23.307
Jordan might shoot, uh, 15 out of 40.

33:24.386 --> 33:26.286
Fifteen out of 40?

33:26.388 --> 33:28.652
I'm just saying, for instance.
He's done it.

33:28.757 --> 33:32.557
But see, if you do that,
you're gonna know about it.

33:32.661 --> 33:34.561
Ooh.

33:34.663 --> 33:37.096
Curtis tells William,
"The most important thing...

33:37.198 --> 33:39.291
is getting the ball in the basket. '"

33:39.400 --> 33:42.130
Curtis said the boy's good.

33:42.236 --> 33:44.966
He say he's real good, but he don't listen.

33:45.072 --> 33:48.041
He said if he listen to him,
he'd be better.

33:49.276 --> 33:53.212
He's always telling me,
you should do this and you should do that.

33:53.314 --> 33:56.181
Seems like everybody I know
is my coach.

33:58.219 --> 34:01.211
I know a whole lot about basketball.

34:01.322 --> 34:03.449
Now it's Isiah Thomas.

34:03.557 --> 34:07.515
I guess, in so many words,
I'm a pro at that in my mind.

34:09.462 --> 34:13.056
The Trojans were led on the
court all season by 6'2'"sophomore guard...

34:13.166 --> 34:15.065
Curtis Gates.

34:25.812 --> 34:30.181
When he went to college,
and Michael Jordan first came to the NBA...

34:30.283 --> 34:34.878
they would, you know, sit around and argue
over him-who could play the best.

34:37.656 --> 34:42.059
Curtis was named Player
of the Decade at Colby Junior College...

34:42.161 --> 34:45.824
but he also developed a reputation
for being uncoachable.

34:46.864 --> 34:51.529
Curtis's idea of being real good is...

34:51.637 --> 34:55.664
you don't follow the rules,
you do what you wanna do.

34:55.774 --> 35:00.040
Curtis finally signed
at the University of Central Florida...

35:00.145 --> 35:03.773
but he didn't get along with the coach
and rarely played.

35:03.881 --> 35:06.406
Even if he didn't play ball...

35:06.517 --> 35:08.117
it was a nice university.

35:08.119 --> 35:10.646
He could have finished school.

35:10.755 --> 35:12.655
But he couldn't handle it.

35:23.034 --> 35:25.161
Security. Can I help you?

35:25.269 --> 35:28.238
I'm used to everybody
in the neighborhood loving me...

35:28.339 --> 35:30.637
and knowing how good I can play.

35:31.743 --> 35:33.158
It just seemed like people looked up

35:33.159 --> 35:35.007
to Curtis Gates when
it came to basketball...

35:35.112 --> 35:37.205
but now...

35:37.314 --> 35:39.839
I'm just a regular old guy
on the street now.

35:52.028 --> 35:54.622
Welcome to the prep game of the week...

35:54.731 --> 35:56.631
in the Class AA Sectional Final.

35:56.733 --> 36:00.066
You got the guru,
the legend, in Gene Pingatore.

36:00.170 --> 36:02.660
Gates.! Good.!

36:02.772 --> 36:05.536
Boy, Gates is on fire.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.609
William Gates is one
of the premier sophomores.

36:07.710 --> 36:10.543
William scores
17 points in the first half...

36:10.646 --> 36:14.377
as the Chargers look to return
to the state finals.

36:14.483 --> 36:17.145
Gates.

36:17.253 --> 36:19.221
Good.!

36:20.756 --> 36:23.020
He is a thoroughbred of a player.

36:26.929 --> 36:29.159
Can they get it done here now?

36:29.265 --> 36:32.631
In the second half, Gordon Tech
turns to their own sophomore star.

36:32.734 --> 36:36.135
Kleinschmidt
drives the middle, puts it up. Good.!

36:36.237 --> 36:40.105
Gordon Tech hangs on to a slender
lead in the waning seconds of the game.

36:40.208 --> 36:42.108
Three-point lead with 12 seconds left.

36:42.210 --> 36:44.110
My guy's William Gates.

36:44.212 --> 36:47.875
I'd like to see him get it, just get to go
one-on-one and pull up and ice it.

36:52.387 --> 36:54.287
Oh, boy. This is it.

36:55.623 --> 36:58.057
- Gates is the man with the ball.
- That's the one I would want.

36:58.159 --> 37:00.922
He's gonna pull up from way out.
Off the front of the rim.!

37:01.028 --> 37:04.293
Kleinschmidt hits it around.
Three seconds left.

37:04.398 --> 37:06.332
Cunningham goes out. It's up.!

37:06.433 --> 37:10.062
No good.! Gordon Tech wins.!

37:13.841 --> 37:17.072
Congratulations
to the Gordon Tech Rams.

37:17.177 --> 37:20.305
They're on a joyride,
one game now from Champaign.

37:40.499 --> 37:42.558
Come on.

37:42.668 --> 37:45.364
Arthur's season ended well,
and he has high hopes...

37:45.471 --> 37:48.099
to play for the varsity next year.

37:50.409 --> 37:53.537
Whoo! Lots of iron on that shit.

37:55.114 --> 37:57.411
Arthur's dad shows up.

37:57.515 --> 37:59.415
Man got big hands.

37:59.517 --> 38:02.145
These days, Arthur rarely sees him.

38:02.254 --> 38:05.280
- Watch this. Watch this dunk.
- Joe, I'm gonna go after you, okay?

38:05.390 --> 38:07.358
Watch this.

38:15.367 --> 38:18.097
You got old legs, Dad.

38:18.203 --> 38:20.103
Old legs.

38:22.674 --> 38:24.904
Hey, man.
I'll see you later on, okay?

38:26.076 --> 38:27.976
Bye.

38:29.313 --> 38:31.611
Increasingly, this playground court...

38:31.715 --> 38:34.684
has become a place
to buy and sell drugs.

38:50.134 --> 38:52.034
"Dear Mother...

38:52.136 --> 38:54.263
"I hope when Mother's Day comes...

38:54.371 --> 38:57.032
"you will light up the sky
with a big smile.

38:57.140 --> 39:00.541
"You, Mother,
are the only one in the world...

39:00.643 --> 39:02.941
"who can provide
and take care of me.

39:03.046 --> 39:05.742
"You are the one
that makes our family work.

39:05.848 --> 39:10.251
"You are the one that I will miss so much
when I go away to college.

39:10.353 --> 39:12.913
"No one can replace you ever.

39:13.022 --> 39:15.115
Love always, Man."

39:16.192 --> 39:18.160
Mother's Day, 1989.

39:30.839 --> 39:33.307
I said to him,
"What are you gonna do this summer?'"

39:33.408 --> 39:35.740
he said, well, he didn't know.

39:39.214 --> 39:41.444
So I said, "Well, if you need a job...

39:41.550 --> 39:43.450
let me know, and I'll see
if I can help you."

39:45.020 --> 39:47.784
We had a job that didn't require
a lot of previous training...

39:47.889 --> 39:49.789
so we hired him.

39:49.891 --> 39:54.327
I messed up so bad on my first day
'cause I wanted to do everything right.

39:54.428 --> 39:57.192
Just messed up everything.

39:57.298 --> 40:00.096
Puttin' tapes in the wrong numbers...

40:00.201 --> 40:02.169
all sorts of stuff.

40:05.439 --> 40:08.567
But I just pushed myself
to come out here...

40:08.676 --> 40:12.009
because I know, in the long run,
it's gonna be good for myself...

40:12.113 --> 40:14.843
and for my family.

40:16.050 --> 40:18.883
I give my mother $50
out of my checks.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.512
All she done for me, I
don't think there ever

40:22.513 --> 40:24.879
be enough that I can
get to pay her back.

40:24.991 --> 40:27.960
Unless I make pro.
Then I'm pretty sure I can pay her back.

40:49.149 --> 40:51.708
I drew on these.
Look at my name.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.851
Tuss.

40:59.892 --> 41:02.030
I had heard that his
nickname used to be

41:02.043 --> 41:04.192
Tuss, so I just started
calling myself Tuss.

41:04.296 --> 41:06.821
Say "Tuss. '"

41:13.772 --> 41:17.606
You know, I say,
"Man, you may not make it to the NBA. '"

41:17.709 --> 41:20.006
he said, "Don't keep on
telling me things like that.

41:20.111 --> 41:23.308
That's just like showing me
you don't have any trust in what I do."

41:23.414 --> 41:27.783
I said, "I do, but don't just keep
putting everything into this."

41:27.885 --> 41:30.353
he said, "Ain't nobody gonna
take my dream away from me.

41:30.455 --> 41:32.855
That's what I wanna be,
and that's what I'm gonna do."

41:36.627 --> 41:39.528
Go first.

41:39.630 --> 41:43.532
I say, "hey, it's your dream.
What can we do?'"

41:43.634 --> 41:45.534
Yeah!

42:04.721 --> 42:06.751
"Dear William, Georgetown University

42:06.752 --> 42:09.249
basketball staff is very
interested in you. '"

42:10.360 --> 42:13.591
"We are going to kick off the season
with a midnight madness celebration."

42:14.498 --> 42:16.432
Bobby Knight called.

42:16.533 --> 42:18.830
Michigan State -
boy, do they ever call.

42:19.668 --> 42:22.831
"Will be on national television."

42:26.342 --> 42:28.333
Any school you name.

42:33.048 --> 42:37.246
"Dear William, there's gold
at the end of the rainbow.

42:38.621 --> 42:41.089
$500 in there for you too."

42:55.236 --> 42:57.534
Did you see Isiah play the other night?

42:57.639 --> 42:59.698
Yeah, I caught the end of it.

42:59.807 --> 43:02.105
- how'd you like it?
- He played pretty good.

43:03.478 --> 43:07.107
The whole school
see me as being a Isiah Thomas.

43:07.215 --> 43:09.979
I'm trying to build my own identity.

43:10.084 --> 43:14.043
When I leave, they're gonna be, like,
"You're gonna be the next William Gates. '"

43:15.989 --> 43:18.457
The St. Joseph Chargers
are strictly man-to-man.

43:18.559 --> 43:22.120
- Gene Pingatore believes in that system.
- Watch Isiah come.

43:22.229 --> 43:24.993
- Going down the middle, throws it up.
- What did he do?

43:25.098 --> 43:28.067
- he took the charge.
- He took the charge.

43:28.168 --> 43:30.124
Something we have to
get you to do, right?

43:30.137 --> 43:32.104
Yeah.

43:32.206 --> 43:35.039
Everything he does
is what a coach is looking for.

43:35.142 --> 43:37.201
You listening?

43:37.311 --> 43:39.506
Out to Clark.
This is Thomas with the ball again.

43:39.613 --> 43:42.480
What an eye.!

43:42.583 --> 43:46.985
You're actually a better shooter
than Isiah from the outside.

43:47.086 --> 43:48.986
True.

43:49.088 --> 43:52.888
That's heads-up ba -
Oh! Thomas! What a move.

43:52.992 --> 43:55.460
That means you have
a lot of responsibility, William.

43:55.561 --> 43:57.620
Can you handle it?

43:57.730 --> 44:00.460
I hope so.
I'm ready to go downstate.

44:00.566 --> 44:02.534
- You wanna go downstate?
- Yeah.

44:02.635 --> 44:06.901
You gotta do something about it.
You have two years to get us down there.

44:07.006 --> 44:08.974
It's going to be all on your head.

44:09.075 --> 44:12.704
Isiah Thomas has just hit his 20th point.

44:13.745 --> 44:15.645
Go.!

44:16.681 --> 44:19.775
Hold up.! William.

44:21.820 --> 44:25.415
The man playing defense
dropped way off here.

44:25.523 --> 44:28.321
Now, who would you rather
have shoot the ball?

44:28.426 --> 44:31.623
Stras shoot the ball there,
or you stop in here and shootin' the ball?

44:31.730 --> 44:34.096
- Me.
- Well, shoot it!

44:35.233 --> 44:36.587
William practices today

44:36.588 --> 44:39.192
having just recovered
from a slight knee injury.

44:40.705 --> 44:43.138
Come on. Let's go.
You're playing soft.

44:43.240 --> 44:45.936
William? Does it bother you?

44:46.043 --> 44:48.375
Don't be afraid though.
Don't favor it.

44:48.479 --> 44:51.846
Tempo.! Tempo.!

44:51.949 --> 44:54.941
Hold it. That's bullshit!

44:55.052 --> 44:57.987
You didn't jump to the ball
and deny the man!

44:58.088 --> 44:59.988
Go!

45:04.762 --> 45:06.821
That's still one.

45:09.099 --> 45:11.192
Nope. It's still one.

45:12.268 --> 45:16.170
We'll stay here all day
until you get a 10-seconder.

45:16.272 --> 45:18.172
William, you gotta take it easy.

45:20.209 --> 45:22.734
Go!

45:22.845 --> 45:24.437
Go!

45:24.547 --> 45:26.447
Go.

45:31.287 --> 45:33.721
Now we start all over.

45:33.823 --> 45:36.485
You people just refuse to work.

45:39.362 --> 45:41.852
You don't know what it is
to be intense!

45:41.963 --> 45:45.922
And if you don't have it,
you're gonna be crap for this team.!

45:46.034 --> 45:48.901
Give me a good reason why I should
keep you on this team, Corey.

45:49.004 --> 45:52.098
How 'bout you, Reed?
Give me a good reason.

45:52.207 --> 45:54.971
What do you think, William?

45:55.077 --> 45:57.511
I mean, how many of these people
work hard?

45:57.612 --> 45:59.910
- Not too many.
- Not too many.

46:00.015 --> 46:03.451
Wanna stay home
when the state tournament comes?

46:05.320 --> 46:07.220
All right. Go on in.

46:18.699 --> 46:22.533
The next day in practice,
William reinjures his knee.

46:30.478 --> 46:34.414
You, most likely,
have at least torn this cartilage...

46:34.515 --> 46:36.380
the inside cartilage of your knee.

46:37.651 --> 46:41.916
And you may have
a ligament tear in your knee, okay?

46:43.289 --> 46:46.588
If the ligament is torn, William,
you would miss this year...

46:46.693 --> 46:48.661
entirely.

46:48.762 --> 46:52.698
This is a lot to happen to you
at an early age. A lot.

46:52.799 --> 46:54.733
I think, if all goes well...

46:54.834 --> 46:56.802
you'll be able to come back.

47:11.850 --> 47:14.512
Everything was just going great.

47:15.554 --> 47:17.454
Now this.

47:23.195 --> 47:25.663
All you guys can't get large.

47:26.999 --> 47:29.194
- Somebody accidentally-
- What's up, man?

47:29.301 --> 47:32.566
Somebody gotta wear medium. You little
skinny guys wanna get in a large.

47:32.671 --> 47:34.571
What the other guys gonna put on?

47:34.673 --> 47:37.072
Watch that boy.
He'll steal your drawers.

47:37.175 --> 47:41.305
Junior year, Arthur makes varsity
for the Marshall Commandos.

47:57.228 --> 47:59.696
This is the year, right?

47:59.797 --> 48:02.129
This is it.
All righty.

48:02.233 --> 48:04.428
Not too bad.

48:04.535 --> 48:06.365
Fine.

48:13.276 --> 48:16.905
Back home,
the family's troubles have worsened.

48:17.013 --> 48:19.709
Now I'm on welfare...

48:19.816 --> 48:21.784
that I wasn't on then.

48:22.819 --> 48:27.347
And trying to live month-to-month
on something like that is very hard.

48:27.457 --> 48:30.187
You have three growing kids
that need this...

48:30.293 --> 48:32.523
and you have bills to pay...

48:32.629 --> 48:36.086
and it's just not enough
to make ends meet.

48:39.635 --> 48:43.935
Man.! Sweetie, is Man in there?

48:44.039 --> 48:46.803
I was never raised on welfare.

48:46.909 --> 48:50.208
My mother and father both worked.

48:53.649 --> 48:56.618
We was cut off for three months.

48:56.719 --> 48:59.244
We was cut off aid complete
with no income.

48:59.355 --> 49:01.482
So, therefore,
do you know what happened?

49:01.590 --> 49:04.023
Our lights were cut off.
Our gas was cut off.

49:04.125 --> 49:06.320
And we were sittin' in the dark.

49:16.004 --> 49:19.770
They had cut me off because
I failed to meet an appointment.

49:28.082 --> 49:31.415
It hurt everybody.
It changed everybody's attitude.

49:31.519 --> 49:35.079
That you can have something today
and it's gone tomorrow.

49:37.291 --> 49:40.385
So you know what the system
is saying to me?

49:40.494 --> 49:44.555
Do you know what it's saying
to a lot of women in my predicament?

49:44.665 --> 49:46.656
They don't care.

50:16.362 --> 50:19.820
The good news is
that your ligament looks fine.

50:19.932 --> 50:22.492
- Good.
- Okay? Your ligament looks fine.

50:22.602 --> 50:25.230
We can actually
sew the cartilage back.

50:25.338 --> 50:30.071
So you're looking at a minimum
of 12 weeks, maybe 16 weeks...

50:30.176 --> 50:32.905
before I'll let you play ball again.

50:33.011 --> 50:36.139
Possibly being able to play
by tournament time.

50:36.247 --> 50:38.147
Okay?

50:45.123 --> 50:48.115
I'm gonna slip you a little something
into the I.V...

50:48.226 --> 50:50.922
to kind of take the edge
off of things, okay?

50:51.029 --> 50:52.963
All right?

50:53.064 --> 50:55.294
- I can tell.
- Yeah.

50:55.400 --> 50:57.300
No doubt.

51:13.851 --> 51:16.786
- Let's turn him.
- Yeah, this way.

51:17.821 --> 51:20.051
If it stays there.

51:20.157 --> 51:23.684
Probably go with the right post here
and little stuff.

51:28.465 --> 51:32.093
The doctor told me he wasn't gonna even
try to get him ready to play this year.

51:32.201 --> 51:35.659
So what do you think
that goin' do to his career?

51:45.481 --> 51:47.949
I really thought Curtis
was gonna make it.

51:49.986 --> 51:52.784
But he didn't make it,
so I just wanted to try-

51:52.889 --> 51:55.357
I just wanted this one to make it.

51:58.860 --> 52:01.488
We were able to repair the cartilage.

52:01.596 --> 52:03.496
Okay?

52:11.840 --> 52:15.469
When basketball is over,
William may not have a friend in the world.

52:16.912 --> 52:19.642
Curtis lost his job as a security guard...

52:19.748 --> 52:22.774
and has been unemployed
for over four months.

52:22.884 --> 52:25.751
Sometimes I sit around
and my eyes just kinda get watery...

52:25.854 --> 52:28.720
'cause I be, like,
I ain't amounted to nothing.

52:28.823 --> 52:31.087
You know, I ain't got nothing.

52:31.192 --> 52:36.528
I can't even go out there and get a job
making seven dollars an hour.

52:37.698 --> 52:41.156
I'll be sitting there telling myself,
"You ain't gonna get no better. '"

52:48.609 --> 52:51.237
What did y'all tell me about
after y'all go to college and everything...

52:51.345 --> 52:53.245
y'all get your own place?

52:53.347 --> 52:55.837
We can all go to Arby's, baby.!

52:55.949 --> 52:58.975
- And get fresh Matt's Cookies.
- And going to Jewel’s for our meat.

52:59.085 --> 53:03.454
- That's a lot of food stamps.
- We ain't gonna need no food stamps.

53:05.024 --> 53:07.720
Each day is a struggle.

53:07.827 --> 53:10.421
Trying to deal with the kids' attitudes
as well as my own...

53:10.530 --> 53:13.431
and trying to be strong enough
for them and myself.

53:13.533 --> 53:15.797
- That is so neat.
- I forgot to turn in my work.

53:15.902 --> 53:18.462
That is what you call a neat paper.
Yeah, that's neat.

53:18.571 --> 53:21.369
Don't you say that about my son.

53:21.474 --> 53:23.601
My son got a brain.
Now, you cut that out.

53:23.710 --> 53:25.836
- But he don't use it.
- See that brain there?

53:25.944 --> 53:28.606
Now there are two
new members of the Agee household.

53:28.714 --> 53:33.174
Arthur's sister Tomika
has a baby girl named Jazz.

53:33.285 --> 53:36.743
And Arthur's best friend Shannon moved in
to escape his own troubled home.

53:37.923 --> 53:39.982
Shannon is like me.

53:40.092 --> 53:42.560
He understood me,
and I understood him.

53:44.530 --> 53:46.998
He could sit back and talk to me
'cause I was his best friend.

53:47.099 --> 53:48.999
He trusted me, and I trust him.

53:51.403 --> 53:55.361
It's been crazy, as far as his father
and his mother's breakup.

53:55.473 --> 54:00.410
He'll come home,
and Bo stealing and buying drugs...

54:00.511 --> 54:02.945
and beat on his mother and stuff.

54:05.516 --> 54:08.542
You have to call the police
or get an order of protection...

54:08.653 --> 54:10.621
for him to leave me alone.

54:29.706 --> 54:32.869
My father was the same way.

54:32.976 --> 54:36.104
I think about it all the time,
when you come home, and they fightin'.

54:36.213 --> 54:39.239
You know, that gets to a child's head.

54:39.349 --> 54:42.250
They can't - Especially when you're
living with your mother...

54:42.352 --> 54:45.788
and you young,
and that's all you see all the time.

54:47.791 --> 54:50.555
He had to do something
to keep his spirit up.

54:56.632 --> 54:58.600
Ahh!

55:05.074 --> 55:06.974
Why you -

55:10.379 --> 55:14.816
Starting at guard,
number 11, a junior, Arthur Agee.!

55:14.917 --> 55:17.477
When I played basketball,
I knew what I wanted to do.

55:18.520 --> 55:20.488
This is what I want, you know.

55:20.588 --> 55:23.557
This is what I wanna do
for the rest of my life.

55:28.396 --> 55:30.261
Come on, win it, boy!

55:34.736 --> 55:36.636
Get that ball.!

55:38.606 --> 55:41.473
He's way behind
where I think he should be at this point.

55:41.576 --> 55:43.840
I've had a few guys come
to me from college -

55:43.945 --> 55:46.470
"Ooh, I like that kid.
He's quick, he's fast."

55:46.581 --> 55:48.913
But something's missing with Art.

55:56.723 --> 55:58.691
Shannon was on the basketball team too.

55:58.792 --> 56:02.558
He was a little more raw
than Arthur is.

56:02.663 --> 56:04.631
I couldn't handle two guys like that...

56:04.731 --> 56:08.098
so I tried the lesser of the evils.

56:08.201 --> 56:10.101
That was Arthur.

56:14.641 --> 56:17.166
Marshall's won six and lost 14...

56:17.277 --> 56:19.744
their worst record in 20 years.

56:19.845 --> 56:22.177
You just in a hurry to do nothing...

56:22.281 --> 56:25.216
'cause that's exactly
what you're doing - nothing.

56:31.190 --> 56:33.715
After spending
most of the game on the bench...

56:33.826 --> 56:36.386
Arthur gets another chance.

56:36.495 --> 56:39.692
Get that ball.! Work that ball, boy.!

56:39.799 --> 56:43.200
Yes.! That's the way you do it.!

56:45.104 --> 56:47.299
In the final minutes of a close game...

56:47.406 --> 56:50.306
Arthur takes it strong to the hoop.

56:52.277 --> 56:55.405
He's called for charging
and fouls out of the game.

57:16.167 --> 57:19.602
- There's been some bad calls all day.
- Amen!

57:19.703 --> 57:22.570
I'm telling you. Oh!

57:41.525 --> 57:43.652
The daily regimen of rehabilitation...

57:43.761 --> 57:46.092
is not the only change
in William's life.

57:49.365 --> 57:51.265
Say "hey!"

57:51.367 --> 57:53.301
- hey!
- Say "hey!"

57:58.374 --> 58:02.868
I was just basically scared to tell people.

58:02.979 --> 58:05.038
I was feelin' sick, you know...

58:05.148 --> 58:07.048
holding all this stuff
inside of me.

58:07.150 --> 58:09.050
I couldn't let it out.

58:10.086 --> 58:13.544
When I did finally tell Coach,
he was like, "When did this come about?'"

58:13.656 --> 58:14.587
And I said...

58:14.689 --> 58:17.658
"Oh... three, four months ago."

58:19.795 --> 58:21.820
he was like,
"Three or four months ago?"

58:23.265 --> 58:25.165
I was in the delivery room.

58:25.267 --> 58:27.167
The nurses gave her to her...

58:27.269 --> 58:30.170
and she handed the baby to me,
you know.

58:30.272 --> 58:33.173
And I'll never forget
how hard she was squeezing my hand.

58:35.277 --> 58:38.269
Once we got her home
William offered his help and stuff...

58:38.380 --> 58:41.838
but it was almost like I didn't want it
'cause she was mine.

58:41.950 --> 58:44.144
You know?
Instead of the two of us.

58:44.251 --> 58:49.018
So then, after a while we -
I finally let him keep her.

58:49.123 --> 58:51.250
And he earned his title.

58:51.358 --> 58:54.122
You smell good.

59:18.618 --> 59:21.348
Your numbers look real good.

59:21.454 --> 59:25.254
I think you're two to three weeks away
from being able to practice full.

59:25.358 --> 59:28.919
- You know what I mean?
- Two or three weeks?

59:29.028 --> 59:31.080
I know you wanted to waltz in here today

59:31.081 --> 59:33.658
and I'd tell you to go back
to practice right now...

59:33.766 --> 59:36.599
but I don't want it
to have to tear again.

59:37.837 --> 59:41.636
I felt that this was the year for me.

59:53.719 --> 59:57.314
I know we can make it downstate.

59:57.422 --> 59:59.754
That's just a big dream I done had.

01:00:03.428 --> 01:00:06.056
I look up on the scoreboard-

01:00:07.166 --> 01:00:10.033
My name is not even on there anymore.

01:00:12.203 --> 01:00:15.172
Where do I fit in with this team?

01:00:22.513 --> 01:00:24.913
William takes a makeup exam in math...

01:00:25.016 --> 01:00:27.211
because he skipped the final.

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:35.955
Here's the cutoff point for passing.

01:00:37.395 --> 01:00:40.124
And you ended up right there.

01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:42.755
So you passed the final - barely.

01:00:42.866 --> 01:00:47.826
When I stopped playing ball,
all my grades just sunk.

01:00:48.939 --> 01:00:52.340
I understand we, uh -
we got the A.C.T. results.

01:00:52.442 --> 01:00:54.342
Yeah.

01:00:54.444 --> 01:00:57.675
Not as good as we, uh -
we wanted, huh?

01:01:03.553 --> 01:01:07.011
William scores a 15 on his first A.C. T.

01:01:07.123 --> 01:01:11.024
He needs to score an 18 to qualify
for an athletic scholarship...

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.026
to any four-year university.

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:17.360
I think what we have to do is get you
set up with the Britannica course.

01:01:17.466 --> 01:01:21.232
We'll have to talk to Mrs. Wier.
Okay?

01:01:22.738 --> 01:01:25.764
Sometimes you have had the right answer
and you changed it to the wrong answer.

01:01:25.874 --> 01:01:28.809
Through Patricia Wier,
William's St. Joe's sponsor...

01:01:28.911 --> 01:01:32.210
the cost of the six-week class is waived.

01:01:32.314 --> 01:01:34.145
If you're just outright guessing -

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:35.745
If a monkey took this test

01:01:35.746 --> 01:01:38.447
and you trained him to
do just B's and C's...

01:01:38.553 --> 01:01:42.683
he probably would get more right
than if he picked A's and D's.

01:01:45.093 --> 01:01:46.993
You just don't know the feeling...

01:01:47.095 --> 01:01:48.995
not knowing
if you gonna be able to play...

01:01:49.097 --> 01:01:50.997
just because of a test.

01:01:51.099 --> 01:01:54.070
I mean, as soon as you
don't tighten one screw,

01:01:54.071 --> 01:01:55.468
everything falls apart.

01:01:56.771 --> 01:01:59.672
- El caballo.
- El caballo.

01:01:59.774 --> 01:02:02.004
- La vaca.
- La vaca.

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:06.240
Arthur, ¿Tienes tu el libro?
¿Tienes tu el libro?

01:02:06.347 --> 01:02:08.837
Mmm.

01:02:11.218 --> 01:02:14.915
- What do I say?
- Okay, how do you say "yes"?

01:02:15.022 --> 01:02:16.922
"Yoy. '"

01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:19.424
- how do you say "yes" in Spanish?
- Sí.

01:02:19.526 --> 01:02:23.189
Sí. Look up on the board.

01:02:25.332 --> 01:02:29.098
He's a pretty smart kid,
but he does just enough to pass.

01:02:29.202 --> 01:02:31.102
Hey, Shannon!

01:02:31.204 --> 01:02:34.105
Most of them
that have come through here...

01:02:34.207 --> 01:02:36.106
and had that type of attitude...

01:02:36.208 --> 01:02:37.418
usually end up in the streets

01:02:37.419 --> 01:02:39.234
talkin' about they used
to play for Marshall...

01:02:39.345 --> 01:02:42.781
and if they'd gone to class they could've
gone to any school they wanted to.

01:02:42.882 --> 01:02:45.976
This is just somebody
standing on the street corner talking...

01:02:46.085 --> 01:02:49.282
trying to find a job, then can't
find a job, that kind of thing.

01:02:49.388 --> 01:02:51.356
This is where he's headed, really.

01:03:03.069 --> 01:03:05.536
- how's your knee?
- It's pretty good.

01:03:05.637 --> 01:03:10.301
Easiest thing right now would be for you
not to play and wait till next year.

01:03:10.408 --> 01:03:12.171
What do you wanna do?

01:03:12.277 --> 01:03:14.177
- Wait till next year?
- Right.

01:03:14.279 --> 01:03:16.338
- No.
- You think you're ready?

01:03:18.016 --> 01:03:19.984
My next year is now.

01:03:28.159 --> 01:03:32.061
I've seen athletes
who have come back from surgery...

01:03:32.163 --> 01:03:35.063
where they worried about the injury.

01:03:35.165 --> 01:03:38.965
When this happens,
they may never be the player they were.

01:03:47.111 --> 01:03:48.496
William's first start

01:03:48.497 --> 01:03:51.207
is the final home game
of the regular season.

01:03:59.089 --> 01:04:01.557
William should have shot it.

01:04:06.863 --> 01:04:10.299
He gotta do that the whole game.
He only do it when they leadin'.

01:04:16.572 --> 01:04:19.666
It was like my injury
was making him look bad.

01:04:19.776 --> 01:04:21.676
Run it out.!

01:04:21.778 --> 01:04:24.246
I always felt that Curtis...

01:04:24.347 --> 01:04:26.815
should not be living his dream
through me.

01:04:36.224 --> 01:04:38.598
If he don't do somethin'
out here on this court -

01:04:38.599 --> 01:04:40.354
Man, he ain't showed me nothin' yet.

01:04:40.462 --> 01:04:43.363
You gotta come out
and start playing hard all the time.

01:04:43.465 --> 01:04:45.695
Otherwise
you're just another player.

01:04:45.801 --> 01:04:48.702
You follow me?
Just remember the way we talked.

01:04:48.804 --> 01:04:50.599
Okay? As long as you're physically able.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.797
If you're not, you
shouldn't be playing at all.

01:04:52.908 --> 01:04:56.002
So nervous about the start tonight.

01:04:57.179 --> 01:04:59.079
But I'm glad it's over with.

01:04:59.181 --> 01:05:01.080
Now I can just...

01:05:01.182 --> 01:05:03.844
get onto the floor more better.

01:05:09.056 --> 01:05:10.956
Spread the floor to four corners!

01:05:11.058 --> 01:05:13.959
St. Joe's has made it to the sectionals.

01:05:15.129 --> 01:05:17.563
And in the final minutes...

01:05:17.665 --> 01:05:21.362
William goes to the free throw line
with the Chargers leading by six.

01:05:33.112 --> 01:05:35.080
Always a clutch free-throw shooter...

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:40.312
he sinks four straight
to help seal the victory.

01:05:49.462 --> 01:05:51.487
In the sectional finals...

01:05:51.598 --> 01:05:53.691
St. Joe's looks for revenge
against Gordon Tech...

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.428
the team that knocked them out
last year.

01:05:59.671 --> 01:06:02.105
With his whole family watching...

01:06:02.207 --> 01:06:06.007
William seems out of sync
and bothered by his knee.

01:06:08.747 --> 01:06:10.647
You are not working hard enough!

01:06:10.749 --> 01:06:13.513
You understand me?
They want it harder than you!

01:06:13.619 --> 01:06:16.087
At the beginning of the fourth quarter...

01:06:16.188 --> 01:06:18.486
St. Joe's leads by a point.

01:06:34.672 --> 01:06:36.572
Got any pain with that?

01:06:36.674 --> 01:06:38.733
While the doctor examines William's knee...

01:06:38.843 --> 01:06:40.606
Gordon Tech surges ahead.

01:07:02.299 --> 01:07:05.700
The Chargers steal the ball,
trailing by one.

01:07:05.802 --> 01:07:07.793
William calls time-out.

01:07:09.739 --> 01:07:13.175
I want it down floor so we can get
it to one of our good jumpers.

01:07:14.277 --> 01:07:16.177
With only seconds on the clock...

01:07:16.279 --> 01:07:18.747
the Chargers find William
in the corner.

01:07:22.519 --> 01:07:25.487
The shot doesn't fall,
but William is fouled.

01:07:28.757 --> 01:07:31.123
With six seconds to go...

01:07:31.226 --> 01:07:34.127
William steps to the line
with two free throws...

01:07:34.229 --> 01:07:36.129
and a chance to win.

01:08:37.724 --> 01:08:40.625
He shouldn't have been out there.
He shouldn't have been playing.

01:08:40.727 --> 01:08:43.161
- The knee?
- I'm very disappointed.

01:08:43.263 --> 01:08:45.697
Y'all get that on tape 18 times.

01:08:45.799 --> 01:08:48.700
Disappointed in the system.
He shouldn't have been out there playing.

01:08:48.801 --> 01:08:51.703
His knee came out of place
a couple of times, it looked like.

01:08:51.805 --> 01:08:54.602
I mean, if winning's that important,
we need to reevaluate the program.

01:08:54.707 --> 01:08:59.337
That ain't no excuse. he got out there,
said there wasn't nothin' wrong with him.

01:08:59.444 --> 01:09:01.345
That's an excuse.

01:09:01.447 --> 01:09:04.416
If he was hurt,
he shouldn't have got out there.

01:09:31.009 --> 01:09:33.203
There's two possible problems
you could have.

01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:36.144
You might have healed,
say, 80% of that cartilage...

01:09:36.247 --> 01:09:38.044
and still have
a small residual tear.

01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:40.049
William's brother-in-law, Alvin...

01:09:40.151 --> 01:09:43.348
takes him to see Dr. Hefferon,
the Chicago Bulls team doctor.

01:09:43.455 --> 01:09:46.424
What you need to do is have
your knee arthroscoped again.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.658
- What side we gonna do?
- Right side.

01:09:50.761 --> 01:09:52.661
Right.

01:09:52.763 --> 01:09:54.387
A lot of people say I shouldn't

01:09:54.388 --> 01:09:56.631
have played, shouldn't
have came back at all.

01:09:59.336 --> 01:10:01.804
Coach kept sayin'
it's really up to me...

01:10:01.905 --> 01:10:05.397
and if you leave it up to me
I'm goin' back out there on the court.

01:10:06.443 --> 01:10:10.846
We're gonna remove
this portion of the cartilage here.

01:10:10.948 --> 01:10:14.475
He'll have a higher incidence of arthritis
as he gets older than you or I would.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:19.578
But in terms of his basketball career,
he has a good chance of performing fine.

01:10:19.689 --> 01:10:21.623
- There's the medial meniscus.
- Wow.

01:10:27.563 --> 01:10:30.964
It's the only thing on my mind,
is gettin' downstate...

01:10:31.067 --> 01:10:33.126
is makin' it down there.

01:10:33.236 --> 01:10:36.899
I want to be able to go all out
the whole year.

01:10:37.006 --> 01:10:38.906
No setbacks, no nothin'.

01:10:39.008 --> 01:10:41.909
At least Coach won't have to say, "William,
you didn't play hard this game"...

01:10:42.011 --> 01:10:45.845
'cause when I step on that floor
I'm goin' be all business, and that's it.

01:10:50.619 --> 01:10:52.519
One year after he left...

01:10:52.621 --> 01:10:55.522
Arthur's dad Bo rejoins the family.

01:10:55.624 --> 01:10:58.218
He spent seven months in jail
for burglary...

01:10:58.326 --> 01:11:01.022
and overcame an addiction
to crack cocaine.

01:11:01.129 --> 01:11:04.895
Man might fail ya, but Jesus never fails.!

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.629
Praise God.! Whoo.!
If you haven't tried him, try him.!

01:11:08.737 --> 01:11:11.900
Sometimes you look for friends
and they're not there.

01:11:12.007 --> 01:11:14.168
- But Jesus is always there.
- Amen.!

01:11:14.276 --> 01:11:17.143
- Even in the midnight hour, he's there.
- Amen.

01:11:17.245 --> 01:11:19.337
Glory to God.! Whoo.!

01:11:19.446 --> 01:11:21.744
- hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

01:11:23.851 --> 01:11:25.751
Glory to God.

01:11:25.853 --> 01:11:29.345
Lord, we know
you always bless the family.

01:11:29.456 --> 01:11:34.894
Glory to God. Even in the beginning, Lord,
you blessed that first family.

01:11:34.995 --> 01:11:38.624
Glory to God. We pray right now,
don't let nothin' come between 'em.

01:11:39.733 --> 01:11:43.726
Send strength, Lord, glory to God,
wherever there is weakness.

01:11:44.772 --> 01:11:46.671
Please, Lord...

01:11:46.773 --> 01:11:48.866
let the love prevail.

01:12:00.086 --> 01:12:02.281
- Yeah.!
- Thank you, Jesus.! Thank you, Lord.!

01:12:04.824 --> 01:12:06.724
That's right.

01:12:15.168 --> 01:12:17.192
While I was incarcerated...

01:12:17.302 --> 01:12:20.203
I just asked God,
"Show me a different way.

01:12:20.305 --> 01:12:24.105
Give me a new life. Take the taste of drugs
and evil way of thinkin' away from me. '"

01:12:24.209 --> 01:12:27.110
I asked the Lord
to forgive me for what I did...

01:12:27.212 --> 01:12:31.911
the times that I mistreated my wife,
beat her physically, you know.

01:12:39.391 --> 01:12:42.292
I just hope this be
a lesson to my children...

01:12:42.394 --> 01:12:45.089
to see me turn my life
over to the Lord.

01:12:57.074 --> 01:12:58.974
Oh, yeah.!

01:13:04.248 --> 01:13:06.148
When I was little...

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:08.218
he had let me down.

01:13:10.187 --> 01:13:14.850
People used to come up to me -
"Your father a drug addict" and stuff.

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:17.222
And I'd just be, like, "Yeah, okay."

01:13:17.327 --> 01:13:18.794
You know?

01:13:20.063 --> 01:13:22.964
And I used to take so much,
you know...

01:13:23.066 --> 01:13:25.899
that he has to start realizin'
that, you know -

01:13:26.002 --> 01:13:28.436
that what is he doing, you know.

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:31.081
'Cause I remember sometimes

01:13:31.082 --> 01:13:33.274
he used to try to go to
church while he still -

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:36.402
he was still on drugs
while he was tryin' to go to church.

01:13:37.447 --> 01:13:39.347
Give me a hug before you go.

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:41.349
- Give your granddad a hug.
- Thank you!

01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:45.386
The closeness was not there at first,
when I come back home.

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:49.116
And then Arthur,
he was watchin' me-

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:51.124
What move would I make now?

01:13:51.226 --> 01:13:53.126
Am I just...

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:55.958
bein' like this
since I just come back...

01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:59.159
or am I gonna break bad again?

01:14:14.148 --> 01:14:18.016
William's dad invites him
down to his auto repair shop.

01:14:18.119 --> 01:14:22.351
He hasn't lived with the family
since William was a baby.

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:25.483
The car that I was gonna give you,
uh, I didn't finish it up yet.

01:14:25.593 --> 01:14:28.027
I got some more to do to it yet.

01:14:28.129 --> 01:14:30.689
I didn't see him for, like, three years.

01:14:30.798 --> 01:14:33.198
It never popped in my mind.

01:14:33.301 --> 01:14:36.429
- The car back there?
- No, that's the car right over there.

01:14:36.537 --> 01:14:38.505
That black Cutlass right there.

01:14:39.607 --> 01:14:41.506
I think he's, like...

01:14:41.608 --> 01:14:44.406
"Oh, he really must be able
to play some basketball. '"

01:14:44.511 --> 01:14:47.412
I think now he sees
somethin' at the end for himself.

01:14:51.585 --> 01:14:55.919
I remember one time he tried to whup me,
but I wouldn't let him.

01:14:56.023 --> 01:15:00.926
I said, "You may be my dad biologically,
but as far as being there-

01:15:01.028 --> 01:15:02.996
Enough. '"

01:15:04.865 --> 01:15:07.925
You say you'd like to come
to my next show that I do?

01:15:08.035 --> 01:15:10.059
Yeah, come out and...

01:15:10.169 --> 01:15:12.660
finally get a chance
to see you sing and -

01:15:12.772 --> 01:15:14.376
Okay. What I'll
have to do

01:15:14.389 --> 01:15:16.003
- I don't have my schedules
right this minute.

01:15:16.108 --> 01:15:19.236
But I'll have to get that,
and I'll let you know.

01:15:29.288 --> 01:15:31.381
Alicia, you're my only friend.

01:15:32.425 --> 01:15:34.325
"A'wight? Jimmi-fi."

01:15:34.427 --> 01:15:36.088
Thank you.

01:15:37.263 --> 01:15:41.665
I always knew that I was
gonna be a better dad than he was.

01:15:41.766 --> 01:15:44.826
I wouldn’t just leave her like that.

01:15:44.936 --> 01:15:47.131
- Alicia?
- Hmm? Yes, Mama?

01:15:47.238 --> 01:15:50.366
If Alicia has a problem,
then I have a problem.

01:15:52.977 --> 01:15:55.172
She's believing whatever she said.

01:16:07.458 --> 01:16:09.517
William's second rehabilitation...

01:16:09.626 --> 01:16:11.321
is at the Baxter Clinic...

01:16:11.428 --> 01:16:14.829
used by many
of Chicago's pro athletes.

01:16:15.999 --> 01:16:18.184
Both of William's operations and rehabs

01:16:18.185 --> 01:16:20.629
have been paid for by
the school's insurance.

01:16:25.642 --> 01:16:28.634
Don't expect to be playing in a game
the first day back.

01:16:28.745 --> 01:16:31.578
My mother put a big restriction
on those pickups.

01:16:33.684 --> 01:16:36.481
She said, "These are her knees now."

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.418
When you're out on a date,
do you have to have sex?

01:16:40.523 --> 01:16:42.889
- No! No! No!
- Yes, you do!

01:16:42.992 --> 01:16:46.325
No, you don't!

01:16:46.429 --> 01:16:50.024
What about the woman's perspective?

01:16:51.134 --> 01:16:54.035
All right, quiet down a minute here.!

01:16:54.137 --> 01:16:57.834
For the second straight year,
Arthur and Shannon must take summer school.

01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.841
- Restate your question.
- What'd I say?

01:17:00.943 --> 01:17:02.968
Shut up!

01:17:03.079 --> 01:17:06.138
This class
is for freshmen, sophomores and juniors...

01:17:06.248 --> 01:17:09.217
who have failed English.

01:17:09.317 --> 01:17:11.217
The basic problem here...

01:17:11.319 --> 01:17:13.219
is that we were strapped for money...

01:17:13.321 --> 01:17:17.655
and we only had one English class
available to our students.

01:17:17.759 --> 01:17:20.956
Hopefully you could touch a nerve
in some of them...

01:17:21.062 --> 01:17:25.362
like a spirited discussion
on a controversial topic.

01:17:25.467 --> 01:17:27.992
Because exactly what is having sex...

01:17:28.103 --> 01:17:32.437
but engaging in an act
that doesn't fulfill -

01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:35.441
Shannon really didn't care...

01:17:35.543 --> 01:17:37.443
so he just stopped coming...

01:17:37.545 --> 01:17:40.275
and he was dropped
from the roll.

01:17:40.381 --> 01:17:43.043
Usually in an illicit-

01:17:44.318 --> 01:17:46.718
Even if Arthur passes summer school...

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:49.721
he may not graduate
with his class next year...

01:17:49.823 --> 01:17:53.350
because St. Joseph's is refusing
to release his transcripts.

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.360
I called up the school.

01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:58.920
The lady explained to me
that he owed $1,800...

01:17:59.033 --> 01:18:02.628
so I felt, well, they have
a school policy there...

01:18:02.736 --> 01:18:06.330
and there's, uh, nothing
I can do about that.

01:18:18.484 --> 01:18:20.918
About how much can you afford?

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:23.511
Okay, we're looking at 18-

01:18:23.623 --> 01:18:26.524
- 13. 10.
- Oh.

01:18:26.626 --> 01:18:28.526
13.10?

01:18:28.628 --> 01:18:30.653
1,813. 10.

01:18:31.698 --> 01:18:34.291
Well, to total that out...

01:18:34.399 --> 01:18:36.959
and from here to -

01:18:37.069 --> 01:18:39.469
June -When is graduation?

01:18:39.571 --> 01:18:42.540
We're looking at somewhere around-

01:18:43.809 --> 01:18:46.539
It's 181.30 per month.

01:18:46.645 --> 01:18:50.547
Is there any way possible that his-
I don't know. I'm just asking.

01:18:50.649 --> 01:18:54.141
- Sure.
- Could his credits be released too?

01:18:54.253 --> 01:18:58.747
I will get a promissory agreement
drawn up. Okay?

01:18:58.857 --> 01:19:01.552
As long as you show me good faith
after the first two months...

01:19:01.659 --> 01:19:04.025
I'll release 'em, uh -

01:19:04.128 --> 01:19:06.028
That would be end of September.

01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:08.030
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

01:19:08.132 --> 01:19:11.033
- Then I'll send 'em to Marshall.
- Okay. That would be fine with us.

01:19:11.135 --> 01:19:13.501
- I really appreciate this.
- How's Arthur doing, anyway?

01:19:13.604 --> 01:19:16.471
Pretty good.
I can't really complain about him.

01:19:16.574 --> 01:19:19.304
- Good.
- Wish he could've stayed here, though.

01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:21.310
- Yeah. Me too.
- Well, things-

01:19:21.412 --> 01:19:24.643
- Things happen, you know, and -
- Things happen, you know, and-

01:19:24.749 --> 01:19:26.649
- hey-
- That's part of life.

01:19:26.751 --> 01:19:29.652
- I can't let him down no more.
- Good.

01:19:29.754 --> 01:19:34.087
Okay, good.
I hope we can work something out then.

01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:36.181
- I'd like to thank you.
- No problem.

01:19:36.293 --> 01:19:38.093
- That's why we're here.
We try to help people.

01:19:38.094 --> 01:19:38.693
- That's right.

01:19:38.795 --> 01:19:40.695
- Okay? Very good.
- All right. Thank you very much.

01:19:40.797 --> 01:19:42.765
- have a nice day.
- Take care now.

01:19:42.866 --> 01:19:45.266
Okay. Very good.

01:19:45.368 --> 01:19:47.233
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:19:47.337 --> 01:19:49.271
- That's what I need.
- Yeah.

01:19:52.342 --> 01:19:57.109
I think about it-had I not been on drugs
when Arthur went to St. Joseph's...

01:19:57.213 --> 01:20:00.113
just how good
it would have been for him.

01:20:00.215 --> 01:20:02.342
He wouldn't have had to leave.

01:20:03.919 --> 01:20:06.203
Here's one of the corners right here

01:20:06.204 --> 01:20:09.186
where I used to come
up and cop all the time.

01:20:12.394 --> 01:20:15.363
Threw away a lot of money
on these corners, boy.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.169
I almost threw my life
right along with it.

01:20:24.139 --> 01:20:26.039
He can just look at my life...

01:20:26.141 --> 01:20:29.598
and say here's a good example
of what not to do.

01:20:31.312 --> 01:20:33.212
If he had my ways...

01:20:33.314 --> 01:20:36.909
I would be shakin' in my shoes
right now.

01:20:46.627 --> 01:20:49.221
Hey, look at that Georgetown coat.
Man, I might get that.

01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:51.696
- Dang!
- Pocket on the side.

01:20:51.799 --> 01:20:54.029
That's the one I was tellin' you about.

01:20:56.003 --> 01:20:57.697
How much?

01:20:58.739 --> 01:21:01.401
Seventy bucks even, no tax.

01:21:04.244 --> 01:21:06.644
Some of the drug pushers
in the neighborhood...

01:21:06.747 --> 01:21:10.706
they'll give us money, tell us,
"Go shoppin; Go get you somethin; '"

01:21:10.817 --> 01:21:14.719
They're thinkin; we playin' basketball
and they can give us stuff...

01:21:14.821 --> 01:21:17.153
and keep our career goin;

01:21:17.257 --> 01:21:20.385
So that's how we were to
keep up with the styles.

01:21:21.928 --> 01:21:24.590
A'ight.

01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:43.580
While you're sitting here today...

01:21:43.682 --> 01:21:45.980
you should feel like a million dollars.

01:21:46.085 --> 01:21:48.383
You should feel so special.

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:51.945
You are one of a hundred
of the best high school players...

01:21:52.057 --> 01:21:54.787
in this country,
the United States.

01:21:54.894 --> 01:21:57.794
My mother, God bless her,
she's in heaven today.

01:21:57.896 --> 01:22:00.156
She used to always say
to me, "This is America.

01:22:00.157 --> 01:22:01.992
You can make something of your life."

01:22:05.103 --> 01:22:06.730
Come on! Come on!

01:22:06.838 --> 01:22:10.137
Okay.

01:22:10.241 --> 01:22:14.473
All the coaches from over here.
To the stands, please, coaches!

01:22:14.579 --> 01:22:16.479
Coaches, we gotta clear!

01:22:16.581 --> 01:22:19.709
If you a player, somebody up there
gonna recognize that you a player.

01:22:19.818 --> 01:22:22.753
So there's 250 of us here.

01:22:22.854 --> 01:22:24.551
We're doing it to try to find out who

01:22:24.552 --> 01:22:26.846
the best players are and
get 'em in our program.

01:22:26.957 --> 01:22:29.858
There aren't very many kids at any level,
including the NBA...

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.724
that really understand
what basketball is all about.

01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:34.502
We always say, you're
going to war, would you

01:22:34.503 --> 01:22:35.993
want him behind you covering your flank?

01:22:36.099 --> 01:22:39.000
If you're pouting,
they're gonna also recognize that.

01:22:39.102 --> 01:22:39.845
And don't tell me

01:22:39.846 --> 01:22:41.900
they're not gonna write
it down in that book.

01:22:42.005 --> 01:22:43.905
At the prestigious Nike camp...

01:22:44.007 --> 01:22:46.567
William hopes to prove
the injuries are behind him...

01:22:46.677 --> 01:22:49.339
and he belongs
among the nation's best.

01:22:59.555 --> 01:23:01.580
One, two, three.

01:23:01.691 --> 01:23:03.249
Next.!

01:23:03.359 --> 01:23:07.819
One, two, three, four.!

01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:17.770
Arthur and Shannon spend their summer
at Pizza hut earning 3.35 an hour.

01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:28.281
Yeah.

01:23:28.383 --> 01:23:31.443
- hello. how are you all doing today?
- Fine.

01:23:47.402 --> 01:23:50.496
It's a waste of my time down here.
I'm ready to go home.

01:23:51.939 --> 01:23:55.204
Here I am, always tryin'
to play this team ball.

01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:59.210
A few coaches - more coaches
comin' around to look...

01:23:59.313 --> 01:24:03.613
everybody feel they gotta do
they own little thing here.

01:24:03.717 --> 01:24:06.185
Move it.! Move it.!

01:24:06.287 --> 01:24:08.187
Stick in the post.!

01:24:08.289 --> 01:24:11.258
Some of you are gonna make it
where you want to be...

01:24:11.358 --> 01:24:13.485
and others of you will not make it.

01:24:13.594 --> 01:24:17.621
This is summer for them.
They don't wanna be sitting in a classroom.

01:24:17.731 --> 01:24:19.631
But we provide them with an experience...

01:24:19.733 --> 01:24:21.825
you can't get anywhere else...

01:24:21.935 --> 01:24:24.301
in that we simulate what it's going
to be like to be a student athlete.

01:24:24.404 --> 01:24:27.305
Fifteen hours a week for basketball.
How many hours do we have up here?

01:24:27.407 --> 01:24:29.741
The statistics on Division I players

01:24:29.742 --> 01:24:32.674
graduating from college
are really frightening.

01:24:32.779 --> 01:24:35.976
Let's assume you're playing
big-time college basketball...

01:24:36.082 --> 01:24:38.812
and your team travels-

01:24:38.918 --> 01:24:41.318
You have to realize...

01:24:41.421 --> 01:24:43.753
that nobody cares about you.

01:24:43.856 --> 01:24:46.950
You're black,
you're a young male.

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:50.495
All you're supposed to do
is deal drugs and mug women.

01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:54.658
The only reason why you're here-

01:24:55.767 --> 01:24:57.667
you can make their team win.

01:24:57.769 --> 01:24:59.828
If their team wins...

01:24:59.938 --> 01:25:02.031
these schools get a lot of money.

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:05.109
This whole thing
is revolving around money.

01:25:11.049 --> 01:25:14.883
Recruiting is like
any other sales business.

01:25:14.987 --> 01:25:16.887
We've gotta win to keep our jobs.

01:25:16.989 --> 01:25:18.888
We've gotta fill the arena
to keep our jobs.

01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:20.890
And if we don't, they fire us.

01:25:20.992 --> 01:25:24.018
I mean, that's - hey, if bankers
don't make money, they fire them.

01:25:24.128 --> 01:25:28.656
When you look at some of these young boys'
bodies, they got NBA bodies already.

01:25:31.268 --> 01:25:34.169
There's one particular kid
who's here now...

01:25:34.271 --> 01:25:37.104
I've watched him since sixth grade;
I've watched him blossom.

01:25:37.208 --> 01:25:40.109
That's when you wanna get on 'em -
when they're young -

01:25:40.211 --> 01:25:42.441
and start writin' 'em
before everybody else writes 'em.

01:25:42.546 --> 01:25:45.947
Try to get any edge you can
in this business.

01:25:47.784 --> 01:25:49.684
It's already become a meat market.

01:25:49.786 --> 01:25:52.846
But I try to - to, uh, do my job...

01:25:52.956 --> 01:25:56.414
you know, and serve professional me.

01:26:02.332 --> 01:26:05.824
What schools do you think
are most involved with William right now?

01:26:05.935 --> 01:26:07.926
I would say DePaul...

01:26:08.038 --> 01:26:11.371
Marquette, Indiana, Michigan.

01:26:12.475 --> 01:26:15.535
Excellent.

01:26:15.645 --> 01:26:17.805
Great job! Way to go!

01:26:17.913 --> 01:26:21.178
Bob Gibbons done seen me
play my best game out here.

01:26:21.283 --> 01:26:24.650
Turned in 16 points, 12 assists.

01:26:24.753 --> 01:26:27.051
Bob Gibbons over there like this -
"hmm."

01:26:29.158 --> 01:26:31.649
Yeah, I was smilin' too, Bob.

01:26:34.096 --> 01:26:36.189
Give me a slice of the crust.

01:26:38.133 --> 01:26:40.033
Probably will.

01:26:40.135 --> 01:26:42.365
Thanks a lot.

01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:46.400
Look.

01:26:46.507 --> 01:26:48.134
Hey, Mom.

01:26:51.379 --> 01:26:53.939
Right now I'm feelin' good about myself.

01:26:58.386 --> 01:27:02.755
I really feel like, since I been down here,
that I was all-American.

01:27:04.892 --> 01:27:08.055
When I go back home
I'm gonna feel unstoppable.

01:27:09.731 --> 01:27:13.690
This one eyebrows up.
This one eyebrows up.

01:27:14.968 --> 01:27:16.868
Swing it!

01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:18.938
Whoo-hoo!

01:27:32.652 --> 01:27:36.053
I'm gonna pull up on it, okay?
Tell me if it hurts more.

01:27:36.156 --> 01:27:39.125
- Yeah.
- It hurts more when I do that?

01:27:47.199 --> 01:27:49.167
Easy does it, now.

01:27:53.606 --> 01:27:57.042
It's on the muscle. It's not on the joint.
It's above the joint.

01:27:57.143 --> 01:27:58.872
Okay?

01:28:03.449 --> 01:28:05.542
What's your name?

01:28:05.651 --> 01:28:07.551
Though it's only a muscle injury...

01:28:07.653 --> 01:28:10.584
it's severe enough that
William will not compete

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:12.612
for the final two days of the camp.

01:28:35.413 --> 01:28:37.643
How many electives
you need to graduate?

01:28:37.749 --> 01:28:39.649
- Six.
- Six?

01:28:39.751 --> 01:28:42.082
Arthur's transcript
from St. Joseph's has arrived.

01:28:42.186 --> 01:28:45.485
If you pass all of the classes
that you're presently taking...

01:28:45.589 --> 01:28:47.921
you can graduate
from summer school.

01:28:48.025 --> 01:28:50.255
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.658
- have you taken the A.C.T.?
- Mm-mmm.

01:28:52.763 --> 01:28:54.663
When do you plan to take it?

01:28:54.765 --> 01:28:56.665
Sometime soon.

01:28:56.767 --> 01:28:59.181
What institution are
you planning on going to?

01:28:59.182 --> 01:29:00.362
Have you decided that?

01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:04.873
I was, um, thinking about,
going to, um... Alabama.

01:29:04.975 --> 01:29:08.035
But you need to take
Algebra-Trig. Okay?

01:29:09.112 --> 01:29:11.011
Do you plan to take that?

01:29:11.113 --> 01:29:13.411
I don't know.

01:29:13.516 --> 01:29:15.484
You don't know?

01:29:17.186 --> 01:29:20.087
So you just barely gettin' by again.

01:29:22.191 --> 01:29:24.284
No. You ain't gotta say that.

01:29:24.393 --> 01:29:26.918
But you are.
You've been barely gettin' by all along.

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:29.930
Now, you gonna have to do better than that
if you wanna go to Alabama...

01:29:30.032 --> 01:29:32.432
or any other school.

01:29:32.535 --> 01:29:35.663
You gonna have to do more
than just get by.

01:29:36.906 --> 01:29:39.373
Don't forget to bring
those papers back to me.

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:41.374
- Okay.
- All right.

01:29:43.445 --> 01:29:46.778
St. Joe's just messed everything up.
Shouldn't have even went there.

01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:50.250
Thought I had more credits than this.

01:29:50.352 --> 01:29:53.685
They goin' kick me out
'cause I ain't payin' 'em money. Man!

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:59.360
That's all right, though.
I'm gonna still make it.

01:30:04.266 --> 01:30:07.497
"Don't let your best
opportunity get away from you.

01:30:07.602 --> 01:30:11.765
"You can have a great experience
at Marquette University.

01:30:11.872 --> 01:30:13.772
"Once you visit our campus...

01:30:13.874 --> 01:30:18.538
"I feel confident that you will know
that Marquette is the right place for you.

01:30:18.646 --> 01:30:21.137
Sincerely, Kevin O'Neill."

01:30:24.818 --> 01:30:26.877
I like these.

01:30:26.987 --> 01:30:30.923
I been gettin; like, two a week
from the school for...

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:34.026
a couple of months.

01:30:34.128 --> 01:30:36.289
So that's quite a few.

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:40.628
I know you're game,
but, Monica, you seem very overwrought.

01:30:42.802 --> 01:30:45.327
I had Division I offers.

01:30:45.438 --> 01:30:47.067
I had even signed at Marquette

01:30:47.068 --> 01:30:49.534
'cause they thought I
was gonna make the grades.

01:30:52.278 --> 01:30:54.439
The great ballplayers...

01:30:54.547 --> 01:30:57.448
they care about basketball
more than they care about school...

01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:59.882
and I know they do.

01:31:10.062 --> 01:31:12.030
Shaky. Shaky.

01:31:15.901 --> 01:31:18.893
Ohh.!

01:31:19.004 --> 01:31:20.904
Let me try somethin;!

01:31:21.106 --> 01:31:24.837
If you're looking for
a progressive college basketball program...

01:31:24.943 --> 01:31:28.003
with experienced leadership
and a winning tradition...

01:31:28.113 --> 01:31:31.480
then the Marquette Warriors
are for you.

01:31:31.583 --> 01:31:34.484
William's first home recruiting visit.

01:31:34.586 --> 01:31:36.519
Three top schools postpone visits...

01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:39.535
preferring to wait and
see how William will do

01:31:39.536 --> 01:31:41.284
his senior year at St. Joe's.

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:45.120
If you don't make the test score,
it doesn't mean we don't want you...

01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:47.129
because we still do-
that's what I'm telling you.

01:31:47.231 --> 01:31:49.131
If you tear your knee out
again this year...

01:31:49.233 --> 01:31:51.133
and you can't
play ever again...

01:31:51.235 --> 01:31:53.601
you're gonna have your education
paid for at Marquette University.

01:31:53.704 --> 01:31:56.537
I know that the scholarship
is one-year renewable.

01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.642
Gene's right about this,
but any school worth

01:31:58.655 --> 01:32:00.667
its salt is gonna
give you four years.

01:32:00.778 --> 01:32:03.804
The bottom line is this-
we want to win the national title.

01:32:03.914 --> 01:32:06.609
Number two-I wanna make you
the best player I can.

01:32:06.716 --> 01:32:09.617
I wanna give you an opportunity
to, maybe someday...

01:32:09.719 --> 01:32:12.847
be one of those guys that makes
some money in Europe or in the NBA.

01:32:12.956 --> 01:32:16.448
You're one of seven guys
that we're recruiting right now.

01:32:16.559 --> 01:32:19.528
- You're recruiting seven guys?
- Seven guys for three spots.

01:32:21.197 --> 01:32:23.097
Where he fit in?

01:32:23.199 --> 01:32:25.099
- Where does he fit in?
- Yeah.

01:32:25.201 --> 01:32:27.761
As soon as William tells me
he's not looking at any other schools...

01:32:27.871 --> 01:32:29.736
then I'm not looking at
any other players.

01:32:29.839 --> 01:32:32.239
So, what?
The first one sign, that's -

01:32:32.342 --> 01:32:35.538
Well-Well, that's what
it's gonna come down to.

01:32:35.644 --> 01:32:38.545
If I tell you that, hey,
you're our guy and this and that...

01:32:38.647 --> 01:32:41.548
and I lose you to Kansas, Indiana,
North Carolina State or something...

01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:43.550
I'm out of luck.

01:32:43.652 --> 01:32:46.382
The president's saying to me,
"I thought you were recruiting a guard. '"

01:32:46.488 --> 01:32:49.423
It's a tough situation,
but it's something that has to be done.

01:33:09.744 --> 01:33:11.644
It's a great place.

01:33:11.746 --> 01:33:13.737
We're gettin' ready
to have it rockin;

01:33:14.849 --> 01:33:17.716
The best is yet to come.

01:33:20.088 --> 01:33:23.080
Lot of serious ballplayers
been through this building-

01:33:23.191 --> 01:33:27.855
Junior Bridgeman, Sidney Moncrief,
Bob Lanier, Oscar Robertson.

01:33:29.797 --> 01:33:33.789
Can you see yourself playing
in this place here, 18,000 in it?

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:37.097
Big difference from St. Joe's, now.

01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:43.141
We stayed at the hyatt.

01:33:43.243 --> 01:33:46.542
Man, it was nice. Real nice.

01:33:46.646 --> 01:33:50.173
They had these balloons
all hangin' up on the ceiling, everything.

01:33:50.283 --> 01:33:52.911
They-They really did it up.

01:33:53.019 --> 01:33:55.613
And I must say, we did it up too.

01:33:55.722 --> 01:34:00.920
We - Room service.
Man!

01:34:01.026 --> 01:34:04.052
Had these phony newspapers written up.

01:34:04.163 --> 01:34:07.291
Notre Dame 77, Marquette 76.

01:34:07.399 --> 01:34:11.495
Gates is out high, calling for the ball.!
There are six seconds left.

01:34:11.604 --> 01:34:15.096
The freshman spins past the defender,
slicing to his left to the foul line.

01:34:15.207 --> 01:34:17.937
Three seconds left.
Marquette down by one.

01:34:18.043 --> 01:34:20.841
Gates launches a running one-hander.!
It's on the way.!

01:34:20.946 --> 01:34:23.938
It is good.!

01:34:24.049 --> 01:34:29.042
Gates buries a 13-footer
just ahead of the horn...

01:34:29.154 --> 01:34:32.749
and Marquette
has defeated Notre Dame.!

01:34:32.857 --> 01:34:35.587
If you think we care about you
a lot in recruiting...

01:34:35.693 --> 01:34:37.854
we're gonna do more
when you're here.

01:34:37.962 --> 01:34:39.726
Don't let it get to a
point where somebody else

01:34:39.727 --> 01:34:41.159
comes in and takes a scholarship away.

01:34:42.567 --> 01:34:46.469
Let us know what you wanna do-unless
you know what you wanna do right now.

01:34:46.571 --> 01:34:49.540
He knows, but he won't say.

01:34:55.847 --> 01:34:58.679
You talked to any, uh...

01:34:58.782 --> 01:35:01.683
leading black people on the campus?

01:35:01.785 --> 01:35:03.685
- The leading black people?
- Yeah.

01:35:03.787 --> 01:35:05.687
- Such as?
- Whoever might be in charge...

01:35:05.789 --> 01:35:07.689
of all the black students on campus -

01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:10.692
what kind of community life
they have for the blacks there.

01:35:10.794 --> 01:35:12.694
- Uh -
- Did you talk to anyone about it?

01:35:12.796 --> 01:35:14.420
- Did you ask the players
how they're treated?

01:35:14.421 --> 01:35:14.696
- Yeah.

01:35:14.798 --> 01:35:16.698
- What'd they say?
- Players say they treated fine.

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.030
I mean, they get
the best of everything.

01:35:19.136 --> 01:35:21.036
- You think that's where you wanna go?
- Yeah.

01:35:21.138 --> 01:35:22.901
That's fine.

01:35:23.006 --> 01:35:24.608
Obviously, if you wait you'll have

01:35:24.609 --> 01:35:26.964
all the other schools
that were on you before...

01:35:27.076 --> 01:35:31.069
like Kansas and Indiana
and North Carolina State.

01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:33.410
That's all right, uh, but...

01:35:33.516 --> 01:35:35.416
I discussed it with -

01:35:35.518 --> 01:35:37.486
I think you should take a few days.

01:35:38.754 --> 01:35:41.416
Because you just came back.
You understand?

01:35:43.192 --> 01:35:45.092
- Poop!
- Yeah!

01:35:45.194 --> 01:35:47.389
Yea!

01:35:47.496 --> 01:35:49.396
Boo!

01:35:52.034 --> 01:35:54.093
Is there any cash with this?

01:35:54.203 --> 01:35:56.102
Uh, it's in the mail.

01:35:56.204 --> 01:35:59.002
To four years of excellence.

01:35:59.107 --> 01:36:01.735
- hear! hear!
- Hear! hear!

01:36:06.081 --> 01:36:08.447
- It's alcohol-free.
- It's not that bad.

01:36:16.925 --> 01:36:20.588
I am fixing him
a birthday dinner today.

01:36:20.695 --> 01:36:22.595
It's his 18th birthday...

01:36:22.697 --> 01:36:26.427
and I want to show him
how much we appreciate him and love him...

01:36:26.533 --> 01:36:28.501
and care for him.

01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:33.198
Everything that you can imagine
was going wrong with this family...

01:36:33.307 --> 01:36:36.037
but now everybody's together.

01:36:36.143 --> 01:36:38.441
It's his favorite cake.

01:36:38.545 --> 01:36:40.740
He's a great kid.

01:36:40.848 --> 01:36:44.306
And some kids don't live
to get this age, you know.

01:36:44.418 --> 01:36:47.649
That's another thing
to be proud about -

01:36:47.755 --> 01:36:50.883
that, you know,
it's his 18th birthday, he lived...

01:36:50.991 --> 01:36:54.756
and to get to see 18, that's good.

01:36:58.498 --> 01:37:02.059
I wanna tell you that I love you very much.
I'm very proud of you.

01:37:02.168 --> 01:37:06.537
It seems like I was 18 just yesterday.
Here. happy birthday. I love you.

01:37:06.639 --> 01:37:08.539
- Ohh.!
- Hey-hey.!

01:37:08.641 --> 01:37:10.541
- happy birthday!
- I love you too.!

01:37:10.643 --> 01:37:13.908
- Come over here.
- Where you goin', homes?

01:37:14.013 --> 01:37:16.208
Where you goin', homes?

01:37:24.823 --> 01:37:26.723
Blow out the candles.!

01:37:28.827 --> 01:37:31.227
Two months after his 18th birthday...

01:37:31.330 --> 01:37:33.696
Arthur is cut off public aid.

01:37:34.733 --> 01:37:36.633
This is what I brought to their attention.

01:37:36.735 --> 01:37:39.033
He's still a full-time student.
He hasn't graduated yet.

01:37:39.137 --> 01:37:41.537
So why would you-all cut him off?

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:43.540
- I'll bite you!
- I'll bite you back.

01:37:43.642 --> 01:37:45.542
They feel like when they get 18...

01:37:45.644 --> 01:37:48.044
most the black kids
they drop out.

01:37:48.146 --> 01:37:51.604
So that means that the child
is just thrown out there.

01:37:53.784 --> 01:37:57.743
I was gettin' 368.
Now I get 268.

01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:02.083
And that's it.

01:38:02.193 --> 01:38:05.651
And that's to take care of me
from one month to the next.

01:38:08.032 --> 01:38:10.432
Now, can you imagine
a person living on that?

01:38:10.534 --> 01:38:13.503
Do you-all wonder sometime,
how am I livin'?

01:38:14.772 --> 01:38:18.708
Or how do my children survive,
or how they livin'?

01:38:19.977 --> 01:38:24.936
It's enough to make people really wanna go
out there and lash out and hurt somebody.

01:38:26.816 --> 01:38:29.410
A message to the Oreo cookie.

01:38:29.519 --> 01:38:33.216
No matter how much you wanna switch,
here's what they think about you:

01:38:33.323 --> 01:38:37.919
Fried chicken
and biscuit-eatin' monkey, ape, baboon...

01:38:38.027 --> 01:38:41.190
big-thighed, fast-runnin;
high-jumpin; spear-chuckin;..

01:38:41.297 --> 01:38:44.755
360-degree basketball-dunkin;..

01:38:44.868 --> 01:38:47.098
Pit-swingin' spade moulanyan.

01:38:47.203 --> 01:38:50.638
Go the fuck back to Africa.
Go the fuck back to Africa.

01:38:50.739 --> 01:38:52.639
Go the fuck back to Africa.

01:38:52.741 --> 01:38:54.641
Think about it. Fuckin' sellout.

01:38:56.678 --> 01:38:58.805
Play the music, motherfucker!
Put the music on!

01:39:09.057 --> 01:39:10.615
Shoot it.

01:39:10.726 --> 01:39:14.822
Rebound.! Go, go, go.!

01:39:19.634 --> 01:39:21.602
Gates stinks.

01:39:21.702 --> 01:39:24.364
You got that? he stinks.

01:39:27.375 --> 01:39:30.606
He doesn't play with confidence,
like he did before he was injured.

01:39:36.083 --> 01:39:38.779
I don't believe the other players
have complete confidence in William.

01:39:40.521 --> 01:39:43.319
They were in awe of William
when he was a sophomore.

01:39:43.424 --> 01:39:45.722
They're not in awe of him anymore.

01:40:08.181 --> 01:40:10.081
Sophomore year...

01:40:10.183 --> 01:40:12.378
I was just carefree.

01:40:15.222 --> 01:40:18.054
If it could be done,
I was gonna do it.

01:40:19.091 --> 01:40:22.151
I wish I could
get that attitude back.

01:40:28.267 --> 01:40:29.734
Go.!

01:40:31.136 --> 01:40:33.195
Hold up.!
That's crap.!

01:40:33.305 --> 01:40:35.773
That is dog-shit crap.!

01:40:36.809 --> 01:40:39.505
Why did you have to
do something unnecessarily?

01:40:39.612 --> 01:40:43.844
If you would've kept it over here, William
- Look at me!

01:40:43.949 --> 01:40:48.351
If you had kept it over here, wide,
you could have gone all the way.

01:40:48.453 --> 01:40:51.911
What is that crap,
the shovel pass?

01:40:53.358 --> 01:40:55.758
There was never any point in our school...

01:40:55.860 --> 01:41:00.388
where we just-
just played outright, you know.

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.961
Now, remember, think about the ball game
on the way to the game.

01:41:21.718 --> 01:41:23.447
I'll bet a nickel.

01:41:23.554 --> 01:41:25.351
If I got a nickel.

01:41:25.455 --> 01:41:27.685
Yeah, I got it!

01:41:27.791 --> 01:41:29.691
Marshall began its season well...

01:41:29.793 --> 01:41:31.693
winning four of six.

01:41:31.795 --> 01:41:34.628
Today's game will be their first
against a city power.

01:41:35.666 --> 01:41:38.931
The only way you gonna beat them
is to play good basketball.

01:41:39.036 --> 01:41:41.436
All that bullshit that you be playin' -

01:41:41.538 --> 01:41:44.700
You play half of a game, for two
or three minutes you play pretty good...

01:41:44.807 --> 01:41:46.707
then you go to sleep.

01:41:46.809 --> 01:41:49.277
You have to play a whole ball game.

01:41:54.784 --> 01:41:58.242
When we start out,
Arthur will be completely in the ball game.

01:42:00.523 --> 01:42:04.186
But as the game progresses,
then he digresses.

01:42:17.272 --> 01:42:22.005
By halftime, Marshall trails
highly favored Dunbar by 15 points.

01:42:33.221 --> 01:42:35.121
But late in the fourth quarter...

01:42:35.223 --> 01:42:37.453
Arthur and the Commandos
claw their way back.

01:42:40.028 --> 01:42:41.927
On a crucial possession...

01:42:42.029 --> 01:42:43.997
the ball goes to Arthur.

01:42:56.010 --> 01:42:57.978
Hey, boy!
Gimme some, boy!

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:01.907
Hey, Arthur G!

01:43:03.317 --> 01:43:07.651
Hey, Arthur G! You ever got rich,
they'd catch you for sure! Come here, dog!

01:43:09.757 --> 01:43:11.656
That's it, man.!
Showin' your beef!

01:43:11.758 --> 01:43:14.454
I want it up high, G.
I want it up high.

01:43:24.570 --> 01:43:27.471
Led by William's 16 points a game...

01:43:27.573 --> 01:43:29.905
the Chargers have a 20 and 3 record.

01:43:30.009 --> 01:43:32.944
But Coach Pingatore feels they're not ready
for the impending play-offs.

01:43:33.046 --> 01:43:35.947
Alabama.! Alabama.!

01:43:36.049 --> 01:43:37.812
Alabama.!

01:43:46.291 --> 01:43:48.953
Well, don't throw the ball!

01:43:49.061 --> 01:43:52.189
Jesus, will you cut it out
and quit acting like a baby!

01:43:52.297 --> 01:43:54.265
Will you quit cryin'!

01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:58.064
This team just drives me crazy.

01:43:59.171 --> 01:44:01.332
It's been a struggle all year.

01:44:02.474 --> 01:44:04.374
You think you're better than you are.

01:44:04.476 --> 01:44:06.603
The two big guys are prima donnas.

01:44:06.712 --> 01:44:09.475
They should be killin' people.

01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:12.481
For you people
that are really agonizing...

01:44:12.583 --> 01:44:16.485
and just hate all this stuff
and all the hollering...

01:44:16.587 --> 01:44:19.613
if you don't make a turn,
it'll be over next week...

01:44:19.724 --> 01:44:21.692
so you won't have to worry about it.

01:44:21.792 --> 01:44:24.124
That's the point.

01:44:26.897 --> 01:44:29.832
I wanna end this game
in the next three to four minutes.

01:44:29.934 --> 01:44:32.903
Otherwise it's gonna be a ball game.
All right, let's go get 'em. Come on.

01:44:33.003 --> 01:44:34.903
Hail Mary, full of grace.

01:44:35.005 --> 01:44:36.905
Blessed art thou -

01:44:37.007 --> 01:44:38.022
holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners

01:44:38.023 --> 01:44:38.906
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

01:44:39.008 --> 01:44:40.908
All right, let's go.
Come on.

01:44:42.645 --> 01:44:45.045
William's just too nice of a kid.

01:44:45.148 --> 01:44:47.275
I don't know if he has
the killer temperament.

01:44:47.383 --> 01:44:49.851
I don't know if he has
the eye of the tiger.

01:44:49.953 --> 01:44:52.478
He's gonna need that
when he goes to the next level.

01:44:52.589 --> 01:44:54.557
Remember, square up!

01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:59.194
It's business, it's big bucks...

01:44:59.295 --> 01:45:01.195
and that's what the scholarship's for.

01:45:01.297 --> 01:45:03.197
Good job.

01:45:23.118 --> 01:45:25.518
- his coach is stingy and selfish.
- My coach is not -

01:45:25.621 --> 01:45:28.021
he just want William
to run out there and play-

01:45:28.123 --> 01:45:30.455
- My coach is not stingy and selfish.
- Yes, he is!

01:45:30.559 --> 01:45:33.960
The day she was gonna be born
I told him he had to be there.

01:45:34.062 --> 01:45:36.962
I don't care what his coach say.
I know the game was important.

01:45:37.064 --> 01:45:41.728
But this was more important,
and his coach doesn't see it like that.

01:45:41.836 --> 01:45:43.736
I just can't miss a game...

01:45:43.838 --> 01:45:46.739
just because, you know,
an incident occur...

01:45:46.841 --> 01:45:49.332
unless it was like a death
or somethin' like that.

01:45:49.443 --> 01:45:53.209
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Ain't like the girl was born every day.

01:45:53.314 --> 01:45:56.715
That's what I was tryin' to get you to say.

01:45:56.818 --> 01:45:59.878
Especially around that time
of the year too - state tournament.

01:45:59.987 --> 01:46:02.455
It was simply out of the question.

01:46:03.558 --> 01:46:06.685
He tells me,
"Well, it'll benefit us in the future. '"

01:46:06.793 --> 01:46:08.693
I'm, like, "But what about now?"

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:10.695
he keeps sayin' in the fu -

01:46:10.797 --> 01:46:13.231
Basketball was my ticket
out of the ghetto.

01:46:13.333 --> 01:46:16.234
If I wouldn't have been playin' ball,
I would not even be goin' to college.

01:46:16.336 --> 01:46:17.854
I'm goin' to college,
and I have a daughter.

01:46:17.867 --> 01:46:19.396
So what's
my excuse?

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:20.558
Because the situations
are much different.

01:46:20.571 --> 01:46:21.633
No, it's not.

01:46:54.039 --> 01:46:57.133
I haven't been workin' for about a year.

01:47:00.846 --> 01:47:04.144
And if it wasn't for William
knowing Miss Wier...

01:47:04.249 --> 01:47:06.149
I wouldn't even be here.

01:47:06.251 --> 01:47:08.128
'Cause I walked in the door and that's

01:47:08.129 --> 01:47:10.745
the first thing I see on the sign
- "No openings."

01:47:10.855 --> 01:47:15.258
It ain't much better than a person
without a college degree can get.

01:47:17.161 --> 01:47:20.460
So I feel like I'll be here
for quite a while.

01:47:32.743 --> 01:47:34.973
What you lookin' at?

01:47:35.078 --> 01:47:39.310
I don't believe people
when they be sayin; "Wow, school's hard.!'"

01:47:39.416 --> 01:47:41.907
The work weren't hard for me.

01:47:42.019 --> 01:47:44.579
All right. I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.

01:47:44.688 --> 01:47:47.589
If I gotta do, like,
a report or somethin;..

01:47:47.691 --> 01:47:51.525
I don't like none of the topics,
so I'll just pick somethin' that's simple.

01:47:54.531 --> 01:47:56.795
So, what's the topic of your paper?

01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:59.232
The life cycle of the butterfly.

01:47:59.336 --> 01:48:02.236
- Gonna read it for us?
- Mm-mmm.

01:48:02.338 --> 01:48:04.238
Aw, come on.!

01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:06.240
No, man!

01:48:06.342 --> 01:48:09.175
- I wanna hear it-
- I'm just doin' this stuff!

01:48:09.278 --> 01:48:11.838
I know, but I just wanna hear
how you write.

01:48:11.948 --> 01:48:14.348
"Well, as the people bloom
into another year-"

01:48:14.450 --> 01:48:17.044
You know, the year just changed,
January 1.

01:48:17.153 --> 01:48:19.053
"The butterfly also blooms.

01:48:19.155 --> 01:48:21.555
The butterfly are very beautiful
flying objects."

01:48:21.657 --> 01:48:23.858
Then it say at the
beginning of the butterfly,

01:48:23.859 --> 01:48:25.684
it goes through a change and all that.

01:48:25.795 --> 01:48:28.696
Then I keep goin', man.
I just wanna, like, do that stuff.

01:48:28.798 --> 01:48:31.698
Then I'll just keep goin'
on and on and on...

01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:33.768
and I won't never stop.

01:48:35.170 --> 01:48:37.934
Move out the way! Move!
Look out! Move out the way!

01:48:40.208 --> 01:48:42.938
Its botanical name is Cannabis sativa.

01:48:44.546 --> 01:48:47.674
Millions of Americans
break the law and use it.

01:48:47.782 --> 01:48:49.682
Arthur's latest report card shows...

01:48:49.784 --> 01:48:52.446
he's failing
both Spanish and Science.

01:48:53.488 --> 01:48:55.388
He rushes through his work.

01:48:55.490 --> 01:48:57.981
As you see,
he just missed one assignment.

01:48:58.093 --> 01:48:59.992
Mm-hmm.

01:49:00.094 --> 01:49:01.994
But his test scores were pretty low.

01:49:02.096 --> 01:49:04.587
- he had a 10 on one test.
- Mmm-mm-mmm.

01:49:04.698 --> 01:49:06.598
Will you do me a favor?

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:10.602
When you see things are slippin' like this,
give me a call and let me know.

01:49:10.704 --> 01:49:13.104
Let me make sure I have
the right phone number.

01:49:13.207 --> 01:49:15.107
So I can stay up on top of this boy.

01:49:15.209 --> 01:49:17.109
Because he tells you one thing -

01:49:17.211 --> 01:49:20.612
I say, "Where your book?" "We didn't have
to work on the book. It's in my locker."

01:49:20.714 --> 01:49:23.342
he gonna have to start
showin' me somethin' better.

01:49:26.286 --> 01:49:27.194
He probably on the borderline,

01:49:27.195 --> 01:49:28.651
and all that clownin',
people just give him an "F."

01:49:28.755 --> 01:49:30.655
That's what I would do too.

01:49:30.757 --> 01:49:33.658
But I'm goin' stay up on his behind
this time around.

01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:37.161
'Cause I told him we payin' 181-odd dollars
out there to St. Joseph's...

01:49:37.263 --> 01:49:39.163
Right.

01:49:39.265 --> 01:49:40.664
For his transcripts.

01:49:40.767 --> 01:49:43.038
He got the transcripts
and he ain't doin' that?

01:49:43.039 --> 01:49:44.931
Uh-uh. It ain't gonna happen like that.

01:49:51.344 --> 01:49:53.244
Man.!

01:49:53.346 --> 01:49:56.076
You remember I told you,
whatever I start I finish.

01:49:57.182 --> 01:50:00.481
I'm not like some people I know.

01:50:00.585 --> 01:50:02.849
I don't need nobody to push me.

01:50:03.889 --> 01:50:07.950
All I gotta do is have the goal
and the motivation, and I'm ready.

01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:10.358
It's Sheila's graduation day...

01:50:10.462 --> 01:50:13.363
from a nurse's assistants class
at a local community center.

01:50:13.465 --> 01:50:16.366
A high grade
will assure her certification.

01:50:16.468 --> 01:50:19.096
I want to be an R.N. nurse.

01:50:19.204 --> 01:50:21.263
I've always had that dream.

01:50:23.909 --> 01:50:26.172
Well, Miss Agee.

01:50:33.684 --> 01:50:35.584
- Sheila.
- Hmm?

01:50:35.686 --> 01:50:39.122
You scored 89 on the exam.

01:50:39.223 --> 01:50:43.125
You're gonna get the highest
grade point average for the class.

01:50:43.227 --> 01:50:45.627
Really? Really?

01:50:45.729 --> 01:50:47.697
No, no, no, no!

01:50:49.667 --> 01:50:52.500
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you!

01:50:52.603 --> 01:50:55.070
Oh, I'm so happy!

01:50:55.171 --> 01:50:57.401
Oh, thank you, Miss Martin!

01:50:57.507 --> 01:50:59.407
You did it yourself.

01:50:59.509 --> 01:51:02.410
Oh, thank you.

01:51:02.512 --> 01:51:04.673
Oh, you so good.

01:51:11.287 --> 01:51:13.847
I didn't think I could do it.

01:51:13.957 --> 01:51:16.721
- I knew you could do it.
- Yeah, you did.

01:51:16.826 --> 01:51:19.021
You gave me that belief in myself.

01:51:20.230 --> 01:51:22.960
You're really inspiring me to go on.

01:51:24.299 --> 01:51:26.927
Not just stop right here,
but go farther.

01:51:27.970 --> 01:51:30.871
And people told me
I wasn't goin' be anything.

01:52:28.595 --> 01:52:33.157
The gym is packed for today's
game against West Side rival, Westinghouse.

01:52:36.436 --> 01:52:40.031
Marshall's rebounded
from last year's dismal 9 and 16 record...

01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:42.108
to go 16 and six.

01:52:44.344 --> 01:52:49.213
And Arthur has emerged as the Commandos'
second-leading scorer and assist man.

01:52:53.052 --> 01:52:55.418
Rebound.!

01:52:56.589 --> 01:52:59.558
Some junior colleges have begun to notice.

01:52:59.658 --> 01:53:03.219
A lot of these kids won't talk
to a junior college...

01:53:03.329 --> 01:53:05.889
really until after they've seen
the dream of, you know...

01:53:05.998 --> 01:53:09.365
Illinois and Nevada, Las Vegas
and Georgetown kind of fade.

01:53:12.071 --> 01:53:14.904
A junior college could
be Arthur's only hope.

01:53:15.007 --> 01:53:17.908
Without better grades
and an 18 on the A.C. T...

01:53:18.010 --> 01:53:20.705
major colleges can't offer him
a scholarship.

01:53:20.812 --> 01:53:23.337
It's just too bad
those kids don't realize...

01:53:23.448 --> 01:53:27.043
hey, if they had an 18,
the door is so much wider open.

01:53:27.151 --> 01:53:30.678
You're in the middle.!

01:53:34.158 --> 01:53:36.242
In the fourth quarter, the Commandos

01:53:36.243 --> 01:53:38.754
fight back from an
11-point halftime deficit.

01:53:38.863 --> 01:53:41.058
They trail by one.

01:53:42.267 --> 01:53:44.827
We gotta play more aggressive on defense.
We're not good at playin' on defense.

01:53:44.936 --> 01:53:46.130
Yeah, man.

01:53:48.573 --> 01:53:50.267
Defense!

01:54:01.118 --> 01:54:05.248
Derrick Zinneman's layup
pushes Marshall to a one-point lead.

01:54:06.823 --> 01:54:09.348
Moments later,
a Westinghouse foul...

01:54:09.459 --> 01:54:11.773
and then a double technical puts Arthur

01:54:11.774 --> 01:54:14.362
on the line with a
chance to ice the victory.

01:54:32.948 --> 01:54:35.781
One more! Whoo!

01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:49.296
The upset win is sweet vindication
for the unranked Commandos.

01:55:10.418 --> 01:55:13.512
- Arthur Agee, you lead the books.
- Junior!

01:55:13.621 --> 01:55:16.680
You got seven.

01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:20.521
Seven turnovers.
Even for the guards, that's too many.

01:55:22.029 --> 01:55:26.227
This is a good win for you,
but it doesn't mean anything.

01:55:26.333 --> 01:55:28.392
You gotta do better than that, man.

01:55:28.502 --> 01:55:30.436
You have to do better than that.

01:55:30.537 --> 01:55:32.437
Yeah, man.
That was a good game though.

01:55:32.539 --> 01:55:34.507
You could have played better though,
you know.

01:55:34.608 --> 01:55:37.475
Oh, Mom. You know he did good.
You’re just killing me.

01:55:37.578 --> 01:55:39.978
You know your mother's proud of you.

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:43.049
He been gettin' down.

01:55:43.150 --> 01:55:46.277
Like a real star.

01:55:48.788 --> 01:55:50.449
Number 11...

01:55:50.556 --> 01:55:54.515
Arthur Agee.!

01:55:57.263 --> 01:55:58.316
Nearly four years

01:55:58.317 --> 01:56:00.790
after discovering Arthur
on the playground...

01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:04.893
Earl Smith shows up to see Arthur win
his first play-off game.

01:56:05.004 --> 01:56:10.601
I figured this game and the next game
may be his last high school ball game.

01:56:13.079 --> 01:56:15.103
- Where you been, man?
- Where I been?

01:56:15.213 --> 01:56:17.113
- Yeah. Where you been?
- I've been workin'.

01:56:17.215 --> 01:56:19.513
- Oh, yeah, right.
- I've been following you in the paper.

01:56:19.618 --> 01:56:22.883
- Oh, yeah. You impressed or somethin'?
- Yeah. I'm impressed. I'm here, ain't I?

01:56:22.988 --> 01:56:24.694
If I wasn't, I wouldn't
have followed you.

01:56:24.707 --> 01:56:26.424
You been
talking to Ping?

01:56:26.525 --> 01:56:28.755
- For what?
- You don't talk to him no more?

01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:31.385
- Why not?
- What do I have to talk to him about?

01:56:31.496 --> 01:56:33.396
- Well, Jamal -
- You ain't there.

01:56:33.498 --> 01:56:36.934
- Yeah, you're right. I had to break out.
- Yeah.

01:56:37.969 --> 01:56:42.871
So I was thinkin' about goin' tonight
to see, uh, St. Joe and Nazareth play...

01:56:42.973 --> 01:56:46.670
but I wasn't sure
if you had time to do it.

01:56:48.145 --> 01:56:50.113
Yeah.

01:56:51.449 --> 01:56:55.078
I've got a bitter taste in my mouth
about a lot of things that happened.

01:56:55.186 --> 01:56:59.213
A lot of people accuse me
of taking youngsters...

01:56:59.323 --> 01:57:01.985
out of the inner city and taking them out
to St. Joe high School...

01:57:02.092 --> 01:57:04.686
and they ask
what did I get out of the deal and...

01:57:04.795 --> 01:57:09.255
a lot of racial slurs and so forth from
my own people about me, about what I did.

01:57:09.366 --> 01:57:13.392
I still felt and feel
that I was doing the right thing...

01:57:13.503 --> 01:57:15.562
for that particular time.

01:57:15.672 --> 01:57:19.039
Uh, sometimes I have second thoughts...

01:57:19.142 --> 01:57:22.077
when I see the net results
of what happened with the youngsters.

01:57:46.602 --> 01:57:48.661
Arthur.

01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:50.795
- Arthur-
- Arthur Agee, sophomore.

01:57:50.906 --> 01:57:52.806
My gosh. What are you doin'?

01:57:52.908 --> 01:57:54.842
- What are you doin' now?
- Goin' to school.

01:57:54.943 --> 01:57:56.843
- Where?
- Marshall.

01:57:56.945 --> 01:58:00.108
Oh, I taught him.
Can you believe it?

01:58:00.215 --> 01:58:03.177
- So you came in case you
have to play St. Joe's?

01:58:03.178 --> 01:58:03.651
- Yeah.

01:58:03.752 --> 01:58:05.982
Arthur. Arthur.

01:58:10.258 --> 01:58:12.158
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:14.469
- What you been up to?
You playing basketball?

01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:15.127
- What? Yeah.

01:58:15.229 --> 01:58:17.322
- how'd you guys do?
- We did a'ight. Still playin;

01:58:17.431 --> 01:58:19.661
Still playin'?
When's your next game?

01:58:19.767 --> 01:58:21.613
- We gotta play Crane.
High school in Chicago.

01:58:21.614 --> 01:58:22.167
- That's cool.

01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:24.170
It'll be all right.

01:58:49.362 --> 01:58:52.729
William is benched
for arriving late to the locker room...

01:58:52.832 --> 01:58:55.733
and Nazareth threatens.

01:59:02.742 --> 01:59:06.701
William enters the game to go head-to-head
with Nazareth star Sean Pearson...

01:59:06.813 --> 01:59:09.975
his friend and roommate
from the Nike camp.

01:59:18.190 --> 01:59:21.216
The favored Chargers
race to an early 14-point lead...

01:59:21.327 --> 01:59:23.887
in this second-round play-off game.

01:59:23.996 --> 01:59:27.295
Give me an "E"!
Give me an "R"!

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:30.368
But near the end of the game...

01:59:30.469 --> 01:59:32.437
St. Joe's begins to unravel.

01:59:42.146 --> 01:59:44.046
William takes control.

01:59:54.525 --> 01:59:57.016
Pearson responds.

02:00:02.967 --> 02:00:07.062
His three-point shot gives the Roadrunners
their first lead of the game.

02:00:11.541 --> 02:00:15.978
For the Chargers, their whole season
may come down to this possession.

02:00:19.182 --> 02:00:21.707
Down by one,
with just over a minute remaining.

02:00:21.818 --> 02:00:27.154
A loss tonight would be their earliest
exit from the play-offs in six years.

02:00:27.257 --> 02:00:29.851
And for William,
there is no next year...

02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:32.292
no more chances to get downstate.

02:01:44.498 --> 02:01:47.160
It ain't but one thing: bad coaching.

02:01:47.267 --> 02:01:49.167
Bad coaching.

02:01:51.739 --> 02:01:54.606
Well, we got him here
about five minutes late.

02:01:54.708 --> 02:01:59.236
So what? This -This ain't no time
to be teaching nobody no lesson.

02:02:10.389 --> 02:02:12.289
All right, boy.

02:02:13.459 --> 02:02:15.427
It's all right, bro.

02:02:17.296 --> 02:02:20.493
- You all right? You're crying, man.
- Shut up.

02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:22.864
Yeah.

02:02:22.969 --> 02:02:25.494
- It hurt, don't it?
- Yeah. More than ever, man.

02:02:25.605 --> 02:02:28.645
- I didn't never want
to go out this way, man.

02:02:28.646 --> 02:02:30.133
- Your last year, man.

02:02:30.243 --> 02:02:33.211
I'm trying to get it, man.
I'm striving for the same thing.

02:02:36.748 --> 02:02:38.875
Hey, man. We'll call you.
Give me a ring. All right?

02:02:38.984 --> 02:02:42.181
- All right.
- You played a good game, boy. All right.

02:02:42.287 --> 02:02:45.222
You're gonna be all right.

02:02:45.323 --> 02:02:47.883
- I love you, boy.
- I love you too, man.

02:02:47.993 --> 02:02:49.961
All right.

02:02:54.766 --> 02:02:57.894
William was 20 minutes late.

02:02:58.003 --> 02:03:00.368
The team was dressed and already talking.

02:03:00.471 --> 02:03:03.133
Then he came strolling in.

02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:05.674
Maybe he has to learn something from that.

02:03:05.776 --> 02:03:08.438
Even in a big game.

02:03:11.482 --> 02:03:13.382
The game was a mirror-

02:03:13.484 --> 02:03:16.385
It was a mirror
of all of the games all year.

02:03:16.487 --> 02:03:21.584
To quote Isiah, the toughest loss
he ever took was the-

02:03:21.692 --> 02:03:24.052
My toughest. And that
was the De La Salle game

02:03:24.053 --> 02:03:26.061
in 1979 when we got beat at the buzzer.

02:03:26.163 --> 02:03:30.155
On a 30-footer. And we were favored
to win the state that year.

02:03:30.266 --> 02:03:35.135
Um, now we look back on it
as just one of those great moments in -

02:03:35.238 --> 02:03:37.798
in our high school scene.

02:03:37.907 --> 02:03:40.375
Our toughest loss to take,
and we talk about it.

02:03:40.476 --> 02:03:43.468
So that's what I look at, you know,
with these things now.

02:03:44.981 --> 02:03:48.178
- Arthur, we could have used you tonight.
- Yeah.

02:03:48.284 --> 02:03:50.650
Good luck.
I'm gonna be watchin'. Don't forget.

02:03:50.753 --> 02:03:52.653
Stay in touch.

02:03:52.755 --> 02:03:54.655
- 'Cause we've talked about -You know.
- Yeah.

02:03:54.757 --> 02:03:56.190
- School.
- Yeah.

02:03:56.292 --> 02:03:58.486
All right. I'm watching you score.
How's your grades?

02:03:58.594 --> 02:04:00.494
- They're all right.
- Good.

02:04:00.596 --> 02:04:02.496
- They're all right.
- We missed you.

02:04:02.598 --> 02:04:07.001
- I missed y'all too.
- Well, I'm proud of what you've done.

02:04:07.102 --> 02:04:09.468
Mr. Bedford said
a lot of good things about you.

02:04:09.571 --> 02:04:11.971
- You be in touch. Okay?
- Okay. All right.

02:04:12.074 --> 02:04:13.974
- Good luck.
- All right. You too.

02:04:37.965 --> 02:04:41.731
Marshall's second-round opponent,
Manley, presents little challenge.

02:04:41.836 --> 02:04:45.169
This just explains a little bit
about our program...

02:04:45.273 --> 02:04:47.468
where our program's headed.

02:04:47.575 --> 02:04:50.203
I like what you're sayin;
and I want him close to home.

02:04:50.311 --> 02:04:52.404
- Yeah.
- You know. And, uh -

02:04:52.513 --> 02:04:54.845
I think, you know -
I'm kind of leaning your way...

02:04:54.949 --> 02:04:57.771
because I just thank God
that he's getting into it -

02:04:57.772 --> 02:04:59.476
you know, somebody do want him.

02:05:01.988 --> 02:05:04.456
I'm Tommy Travis,
Northeastern Illinois assistant coach.

02:05:04.557 --> 02:05:06.457
- Okay. Nice to meet you.
- I'm Arthur's father.

02:05:06.559 --> 02:05:08.823
- Arthur hester.
- Okay. Arthur hester.

02:05:08.929 --> 02:05:10.453
Us Arts gotta stick together.

02:05:10.563 --> 02:05:11.962
- I'm over at Kennedy-King.
- Kennedy-King?

02:05:12.065 --> 02:05:13.965
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:05:14.067 --> 02:05:16.160
May the best man win.

02:05:16.269 --> 02:05:19.898
- I thought mom was a cheerleader.
- Oh, thanks.

02:05:21.141 --> 02:05:23.109
Thank you for the compliment.

02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:27.008
His parents seem to think
he may, uh, pass the A.C.T.

02:05:27.112 --> 02:05:29.410
- he may what?
- He may pass it.

02:05:29.515 --> 02:05:31.983
Oh, yeah.
Well, I hope he does.

02:05:32.084 --> 02:05:34.609
- Us Arts gotta stick together, guy.
- Yeah.

02:05:36.288 --> 02:05:38.085
- Okay.
- Hey.

02:05:38.190 --> 02:05:41.353
Would you get excited if a college coach
came up and talked to you?

02:05:42.394 --> 02:05:44.362
Not really.

02:05:45.397 --> 02:05:47.297
Really, it's just-
You’re just going...

02:05:47.399 --> 02:05:50.095
to another level
of basketball. That's all.

02:05:50.202 --> 02:05:52.295
I'll be excited when I get there.

02:05:52.404 --> 02:05:55.099
That's when you'll be
excited the whole year.

02:05:55.206 --> 02:05:59.074
I'll be excited as soon as I step up
in there - first day of practice.

02:06:00.545 --> 02:06:03.571
If I graduate, I think I'll be
the only one in my family...

02:06:03.681 --> 02:06:06.514
besides my uncle,
to finish college.

02:06:06.617 --> 02:06:08.812
Me too.

02:06:11.422 --> 02:06:13.947
In the fourth round
against heavily favored Taft...

02:06:14.058 --> 02:06:17.027
Marshall meets their first
true test of the play-offs.

02:06:21.199 --> 02:06:23.928
But the Commandos have been
bucking the odds all year.

02:06:34.044 --> 02:06:37.172
Arthur plays one of his best games
of the season...

02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:39.180
scoring 19 points...

02:06:39.282 --> 02:06:42.740
and the Commandos claim a spot
in the city semifinals.

02:06:53.362 --> 02:06:58.390
The final four! I told y'all
he was going all the way. All the way!

02:06:58.501 --> 02:07:01.197
Do you guys feel you can play with
any team in the city?

02:07:01.303 --> 02:07:03.999
On any given day, we can play with anybody.
We can beat anybody.

02:07:15.684 --> 02:07:18.209
Marshall now faces
the ultimate test::

02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:21.720
King high School,
the rulers of the public league.

02:07:23.825 --> 02:07:25.920
Winners of last year's state crown,

02:07:25.921 --> 02:07:28.694
they were labeled the
best team in the country.

02:07:28.797 --> 02:07:32.460
King has sparked controversy
by out-recruiting rivals...

02:07:32.567 --> 02:07:35.730
for the biggest and best
grammar school players.

02:07:35.837 --> 02:07:40.274
We don't understand what
we're really doing to these young kids.

02:07:40.375 --> 02:07:42.275
Kid not even 12 years old...

02:07:42.377 --> 02:07:44.607
and you're baiting him
to come to your school...

02:07:44.712 --> 02:07:46.612
you know, to play basketball.

02:07:46.714 --> 02:07:48.807
Falls back in the paint.

02:07:48.917 --> 02:07:51.612
I'm not going to start
recruiting in that manner.

02:07:51.718 --> 02:07:55.017
No, I'll probably get out
of the game before then.

02:07:57.324 --> 02:07:59.724
The winner of these two semifinal games...

02:07:59.827 --> 02:08:03.786
will play for the Chicago Public
high School Basketball Championship.

02:08:09.570 --> 02:08:14.940
King's strategy is to
go inside to its two seven-foot starters.

02:08:19.378 --> 02:08:22.814
Only Arthur seems
unintimidated by the Jaguars.

02:08:28.988 --> 02:08:31.752
And King's poor play
keeps the game close.

02:08:32.792 --> 02:08:35.386
We are the... best.!
We are the team!

02:08:35.495 --> 02:08:37.622
I think they gonna take it.

02:08:38.664 --> 02:08:42.122
But in the second half,
King makes their move.

02:08:45.938 --> 02:08:48.098
- What are you doin'?
- Come on. Get in the game.!

02:08:48.206 --> 02:08:50.640
King grabs a four-point lead.

02:08:50.742 --> 02:08:53.142
Hey, Mookie, Mookie, Mookie!

02:08:53.245 --> 02:08:55.577
Y'all playing
with no confidence whatsoever.

02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:57.614
None!

02:08:57.716 --> 02:09:00.014
None.!

02:09:00.118 --> 02:09:03.019
- All right! Go get in charge of that ball!
- Don't foul him! Don't foul him!

02:09:07.859 --> 02:09:09.326
Let's go! Let's go!

02:09:09.427 --> 02:09:12.362
The Commandos get aggressive on defense...

02:09:12.464 --> 02:09:14.659
Too soon now!

02:09:14.766 --> 02:09:17.825
And use their superior speed on offense.

02:09:29.613 --> 02:09:32.741
Players, sit down.
We got three minutes to go. Sit down.

02:09:32.850 --> 02:09:35.944
Marshall grabs a six-point lead
late in the game.

02:09:36.053 --> 02:09:38.044
We got a long time to play.

02:09:39.423 --> 02:09:42.551
Coach Bedford wants to force King
out of their zone defense...

02:09:42.660 --> 02:09:46.993
and make their big, slow players match up
man-to-man against Marshall's quick guards.

02:09:47.096 --> 02:09:49.496
One, two, three. Defense!

02:09:53.369 --> 02:09:56.702
Arthur simply holds the ball
as the clock ticks away.

02:10:03.179 --> 02:10:05.807
The King coach has no choice.

02:10:24.933 --> 02:10:28.596
For the defending national champions,
it's all over.

02:10:34.376 --> 02:10:37.641
And unranked Marshall
will play for the city title.

02:10:55.263 --> 02:10:59.461
Whoo! 26-2 now!

02:11:01.235 --> 02:11:03.669
They're 26 and 2 now.

02:11:03.771 --> 02:11:06.296
That's my Man!

02:11:07.341 --> 02:11:09.639
All right, Man!

02:11:09.744 --> 02:11:11.644
- I told you we could do it.
- Yes!

02:11:11.746 --> 02:11:14.475
- I told you we could do it.
- I told you you were gonna do it.

02:11:14.581 --> 02:11:16.481
I knew y'all was going all the way.
I told ya.

02:11:16.583 --> 02:11:18.483
I said, "You're going all the way."

02:11:19.519 --> 02:11:22.886
This is your last year.
You're going all the way. Yeah.

02:11:24.958 --> 02:11:28.052
They got the best shot of him, you know.

02:11:28.161 --> 02:11:31.562
And it's great.
That was a great shot, wasn't it?

02:11:31.665 --> 02:11:36.193
But this one in the, uh, Tribune
is what I really like.

02:11:36.303 --> 02:11:40.103
It says,
"Arthur Agee stood as still as a statue.

02:11:40.206 --> 02:11:43.572
Time after time was on his side."

02:11:43.676 --> 02:11:47.009
You know, the championship
that I missed when I was in high school-

02:11:47.112 --> 02:11:49.012
Yeah.

02:11:49.114 --> 02:11:52.743
Twenty-one years later I got a chance
at getting a championship through him.

02:11:52.851 --> 02:11:55.376
You know, you're always trying to
build your children up...

02:11:55.487 --> 02:11:57.387
and saying, "Well, you-all can do it"...

02:11:57.489 --> 02:12:00.287
but, you know, really lying on
the inside a little bit, saying...

02:12:00.392 --> 02:12:02.292
"Well, you know, you got a long haul."

02:12:02.394 --> 02:12:04.453
But, you know,
this make you even more confidence...

02:12:04.563 --> 02:12:07.498
because if he's sure of hisself,
then you know you can bank on it.

02:12:07.599 --> 02:12:12.092
Yesterday, you know, when he won the game,
you know, he told me he loved me.

02:12:12.203 --> 02:12:14.865
And, you know, I haven't heard that
in, uh -You know.

02:12:14.972 --> 02:12:19.409
You can feel it, but I haven't heard it
coming verbally from him.

02:12:30.021 --> 02:12:33.479
In a rematch with rival Westinghouse...

02:12:33.591 --> 02:12:37.652
Marshall proves to everybody
they have what it takes to be city champs.

02:12:37.762 --> 02:12:40.594
Inside pass. Shot rejected.

02:12:44.935 --> 02:12:47.802
To the lane with the layin.

02:12:47.904 --> 02:12:50.668
Busts this game wide open.

02:12:50.774 --> 02:12:55.143
Did you see that?
Did you see it? Did you see it?

02:12:56.613 --> 02:12:59.673
They are celebrating because they know...

02:12:59.783 --> 02:13:02.809
their high school is headed
to the elite eight in Champaign.

02:13:06.490 --> 02:13:10.289
And the Marshall Commandos
have won the Public League Championship...

02:13:10.393 --> 02:13:12.520
in convincing fashion-

02:13:12.628 --> 02:13:17.622
58-38 winners over
the Westinghouse Warriors.

02:13:31.614 --> 02:13:34.549
What's up, man?
Told you on the phone what I was gonna do.

02:13:34.650 --> 02:13:36.618
Told you, boy.

02:13:39.788 --> 02:13:42.586
Marshall, baby. Marshall!

02:13:42.690 --> 02:13:44.590
Marshall!

02:13:44.692 --> 02:13:48.492
Marshall.! Marshall.!

02:13:48.596 --> 02:13:52.430
Marshall.! Marshall.!

02:13:59.574 --> 02:14:03.567
Your A.C.T. came in, William,
and you received a 14 for a composite...

02:14:03.678 --> 02:14:05.873
which is not high enough.

02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:08.709
Uh, you've taken the test-
Now, this was for the fourth time.

02:14:08.816 --> 02:14:12.308
Now, if you add all those up,
it comes out to 17.2.

02:14:12.419 --> 02:14:15.183
In order to play at Marquette,
you're gonna have to get the 18.

02:14:15.289 --> 02:14:17.189
And they're very, very concerned.

02:14:17.291 --> 02:14:21.227
One assistant called twice this week,
and Bo Ellis called today.

02:14:23.363 --> 02:14:25.991
Smile, William.
It's not the end of the world.

02:14:26.099 --> 02:14:28.033
- Right?
- I hope not.

02:14:28.135 --> 02:14:31.366
Well, you gotta work at this
as hard as you worked at your jump shot.

02:14:31.472 --> 02:14:33.963
And it was missing a lot this year.

02:14:34.074 --> 02:14:36.041
Okay.

02:14:36.142 --> 02:14:39.669
Now you are down to the final inning
and the last strike.

02:14:46.118 --> 02:14:49.053
We're going, going downstate!
We're going downstate!

02:14:49.155 --> 02:14:52.318
Now let's, let's celebrate!
Now let's celebrate!

02:14:52.425 --> 02:14:55.189
- What are we gonna be?
- State champions.!

02:14:55.294 --> 02:14:58.161
Your Marshall Commandos.!

02:15:02.568 --> 02:15:04.660
- Yeah!
- We're gonna take state!

02:15:04.769 --> 02:15:06.930
Take state! Number one!

02:15:32.831 --> 02:15:35.663
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A.!

02:15:35.766 --> 02:15:38.758
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A.!

02:15:38.869 --> 02:15:42.965
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A!

02:15:52.016 --> 02:15:56.043
Downstate Marshall plays
its familiar role as underdog...

02:15:56.153 --> 02:15:58.053
to third-ranked Batavia.

02:15:58.155 --> 02:16:00.055
Justice has it. Justice, one-on-two.

02:16:00.157 --> 02:16:02.750
- Spins up-
- Nice move.

02:16:06.663 --> 02:16:10.724
In the media glare of a statewide
audience, Marshall shows big-game jitters.

02:16:10.833 --> 02:16:12.767
Now bust out.

02:16:12.869 --> 02:16:15.702
And Marshall missed the layup.

02:16:17.206 --> 02:16:19.640
Sealed off, blocked by Williams.

02:16:19.742 --> 02:16:23.644
You got easy shots.
You gotta make your easy shots.

02:16:23.746 --> 02:16:25.714
I can't shoot for you.

02:16:25.815 --> 02:16:30.514
Now he's gonna penetrate.
Left it for Christian. Missed the shot.

02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:35.522
Luther Bedford looks like
he's ready to commit suicide over there.

02:16:35.624 --> 02:16:38.218
Y'all better get on your job,
Commandos!

02:16:38.326 --> 02:16:40.454
- Now into the corner.
- Get in there.

02:16:40.562 --> 02:16:43.929
Batavia's got these guys on the run.

02:16:46.034 --> 02:16:47.933
One, one, one, one!

02:16:48.036 --> 02:16:50.504
One, one, one, one.!

02:16:51.974 --> 02:16:55.034
But in the third quarter,
the Commandos charge back.

02:16:55.143 --> 02:16:57.043
And a steal by Marshall.!

02:16:57.145 --> 02:16:59.841
Agee gonna take it all the way.

02:16:59.948 --> 02:17:04.111
Yes! That's the way you go!

02:17:04.218 --> 02:17:06.379
- here we go.
- Picked him clean.

02:17:06.486 --> 02:17:08.421
Dale. Marshall leads.

02:17:08.522 --> 02:17:11.616
Marshall's first lead
since the first quarter.

02:17:11.726 --> 02:17:14.718
Like a lightning bolt,
the Commandos have struck.

02:17:14.829 --> 02:17:18.356
37-36, Marshall leading Batavia.

02:17:18.466 --> 02:17:21.196
Chicago Marshall has exploded-

02:17:25.940 --> 02:17:27.874
I always dreamed of, like...

02:17:27.975 --> 02:17:30.772
me and William taking
them downstate together.

02:17:31.878 --> 02:17:33.778
When I was at St. Joseph...

02:17:33.879 --> 02:17:36.474
maybe we could have went downstate,
and maybe we couldn't.

02:17:36.583 --> 02:17:39.518
But we did when I'm at Marshall.

02:17:53.133 --> 02:17:55.727
Arthur's big fourth quarter
helps add Batavia...

02:17:55.834 --> 02:17:57.769
to Marshall's growing list of upsets.

02:17:57.870 --> 02:18:01.465
Spectacular comeback
in the fourth quarter by the Commandos-

02:18:01.573 --> 02:18:03.473
In the post-game news conference...

02:18:03.575 --> 02:18:06.772
Coach Bedford labels
his unranked team "the giant killers. '"

02:18:10.782 --> 02:18:13.513
- Y'all are playing the number one team.
- We're playing the number one team.

02:18:13.619 --> 02:18:15.519
We're playing the number two team.

02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:19.489
This is the first time in the history
of the school that we've gone this far.

02:18:19.591 --> 02:18:22.218
- Really?
- In the history of the school.

02:18:22.326 --> 02:18:24.692
Just like the Commandos.
See, we been the underdog.

02:18:24.797 --> 02:18:28.197
I'm glad we are because then
it just show you how you could come up.

02:18:28.299 --> 02:18:30.824
And then you beat your opponent.

02:18:33.037 --> 02:18:35.267
Oh, yeah.

02:18:49.187 --> 02:18:52.179
Be a good place for Man to come.

02:18:52.290 --> 02:18:55.452
Yeah. This is really, you know,
something that a -

02:18:55.559 --> 02:18:58.153
a child would really miss out on.

02:18:58.261 --> 02:19:00.821
Like a whole different world.

02:19:00.931 --> 02:19:02.922
It's beyond different.

02:19:03.032 --> 02:19:05.661
Uh-huh.

02:19:13.744 --> 02:19:17.544
In this semifinal game,
we'll see some great individuals...

02:19:17.647 --> 02:19:19.672
just as we saw many years ago.

02:19:19.782 --> 02:19:22.752
Remember Isiah Thomas,
one of the great guards.

02:19:22.852 --> 02:19:26.253
Here you see the same moves
he plays with in the NBA today.

02:19:26.355 --> 02:19:30.348
Well, we've got someone like that:
howard Nathan, number 34...

02:19:30.459 --> 02:19:32.393
for Peoria Manual.

02:19:32.495 --> 02:19:34.588
Marshall got here because of
one reason: quickness.

02:19:34.697 --> 02:19:38.826
The reason: Arthur Agee.
Look at this man. he just explodes, Dan.

02:19:38.933 --> 02:19:42.630
He can get down court
as quick as anyone I've ever seen.

02:19:42.737 --> 02:19:44.638
In the semifinals...

02:19:44.740 --> 02:19:48.107
Arthur goes head-to-head
with howard Nathan, the all-American.

02:19:48.209 --> 02:19:51.236
Make him work for it, Man.
Make him work for what he get.

02:19:52.281 --> 02:19:55.408
All right! Let's go!
All the way, Man! All the way!

02:19:56.751 --> 02:19:59.743
Yeah! That's it! That's it! That's it!

02:19:59.854 --> 02:20:04.484
Arthur Agee, spinning inside,
tough shot. Good.

02:20:04.592 --> 02:20:06.787
Arthur has a great first half...

02:20:06.895 --> 02:20:09.125
but the Rams play even better.

02:20:10.799 --> 02:20:13.199
He's got it.

02:20:14.235 --> 02:20:16.931
Get up for the Rams!
Everybody get up!

02:20:17.038 --> 02:20:19.302
Get up for the Rams.!

02:20:19.407 --> 02:20:22.934
In the second half,
Arthur tries to pick up where he left off.

02:20:23.044 --> 02:20:24.807
Penetration move by Agee. Slapped

02:20:24.808 --> 02:20:27.207
out of there by Manual.
They've got two-on-one.

02:20:27.314 --> 02:20:30.249
Ooh, and a nice fake and a score.

02:20:30.350 --> 02:20:33.183
But it's the Rams who don't miss a beat...

02:20:33.287 --> 02:20:35.221
pressing the tempo against
the tired Commandos.

02:20:35.322 --> 02:20:37.984
You're not in the offense at all.

02:20:38.091 --> 02:20:40.719
You're just out there
playing individual basketball.

02:20:40.828 --> 02:20:42.728
Completely.

02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:46.857
Hey, hey, guys. No fouls.
We want to keep the clock going. Remember?

02:20:46.967 --> 02:20:48.992
Let's go, Marshall!
Let's go!

02:20:49.102 --> 02:20:51.832
Let's go, Marshall.!
Let's go.!

02:20:51.939 --> 02:20:55.032
Marshall showed us last night
they have the ability to come back.

02:20:55.141 --> 02:20:57.132
Let's see what they can do here.

02:21:11.791 --> 02:21:13.884
This is Nathan.

02:21:13.993 --> 02:21:15.893
Nice pass.
Knock it down.

02:21:15.995 --> 02:21:19.795
Biggest lead of the game now,
and the Rams fans can smell it.

02:21:21.299 --> 02:21:24.166
Been a great run
for Luther Bedford's team.

02:21:25.203 --> 02:21:27.569
The string of upsets stops here.

02:21:29.207 --> 02:21:32.199
- And a foul on Agee.
- He fouls out.

02:21:32.310 --> 02:21:35.473
But he just never quit.
He just kept going for the basketball.

02:21:40.418 --> 02:21:44.878
I wouldn't be surprised
if he made the all-tournament team tonight.

02:22:05.209 --> 02:22:07.734
- Number one!
- We're number one.!

02:22:07.845 --> 02:22:09.779
We're still number one.

02:22:09.880 --> 02:22:11.780
All right. All right.

02:22:11.882 --> 02:22:13.873
Though they lose to Peoria Manual...

02:22:13.984 --> 02:22:19.115
they finish third in the state, the highest
a Marshall team has finished since 1960.

02:22:21.691 --> 02:22:25.149
This was a great season you had.

02:22:25.261 --> 02:22:30.358
There is nothing sweeter
than going downstate as a young person.

02:22:30.466 --> 02:22:32.832
I mean, the record's
gonna stay there, you know.

02:22:32.936 --> 02:22:36.303
1991, there was a team
from Marshall played.

02:22:36.406 --> 02:22:38.636
- You know, and you're part of that.
- Yeah.

02:22:38.741 --> 02:22:40.868
- That's part of history.
- Ah!

02:22:40.977 --> 02:22:44.140
But for you seniors, you know-

02:22:44.247 --> 02:22:49.309
Best wishes to all you seniors,
and whatever you try to do, uh...

02:22:49.418 --> 02:22:51.909
Mr. Williams and I
will be around school...

02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:53.920
as we always are -

02:22:54.022 --> 02:22:56.752
to help you if you want to be helped, okay?

02:22:58.994 --> 02:23:02.725
Winning five games in six days,
that really takes a lot out of you.

02:23:02.831 --> 02:23:05.823
Like Coach said, you just gotta sacrifice-

02:23:05.934 --> 02:23:07.925
you know, sacrifice everything you have.

02:23:08.036 --> 02:23:09.765
Like, if you love the
game of basketball,

02:23:09.766 --> 02:23:11.699
you just go out there
and give all your heart.

02:23:11.807 --> 02:23:14.867
He got a little ways to go,
but he's - he's gonna get there.

02:23:14.977 --> 02:23:17.501
Hopefully he's got his head
screwed on pretty good, you know...

02:23:17.611 --> 02:23:21.775
and now, you know,
he's gonna be on his own to do whatever.

02:23:21.882 --> 02:23:23.782
Hopefully he'll do it right.

02:23:23.884 --> 02:23:27.513
When we got down here, people don't expect
- "Marshall? how'd they get down here?"

02:23:27.621 --> 02:23:29.614
They lookin' like: "Who
they got on their team?"

02:23:29.615 --> 02:23:31.079
I had to come out and prove myself.

02:23:31.192 --> 02:23:34.923
I think I could play Division I basketball.

02:23:35.029 --> 02:23:38.988
'Cause all I need is just a scholarship.
That's -That's all I'm looking for.

02:23:39.100 --> 02:23:41.068
Arthur Agee.

02:23:46.306 --> 02:23:48.274
All right!

02:24:08.661 --> 02:24:11.960
All this area through here
is our new computer labs.

02:24:12.065 --> 02:24:13.999
We'll take you through
all those rooms.

02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:16.124
Arthur's first recruiting visit...

02:24:16.235 --> 02:24:18.396
takes him to a junior college
in Southern Missouri.

02:24:18.504 --> 02:24:20.652
The strength that I see here

02:24:20.653 --> 02:24:23.908
is the tremendous
teaching that goes on here.

02:24:24.009 --> 02:24:26.273
Have you decided
what you want to go into?

02:24:26.378 --> 02:24:28.573
Uh, communications.

02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:32.639
Are you more interested
in the overall communications -

02:24:32.751 --> 02:24:35.311
That, and, uh -
I like that and accounting.

02:24:35.421 --> 02:24:37.753
- Like business.
- Oh. Okay.

02:24:37.856 --> 02:24:41.792
We enjoy winning things,
but the primary purpose is your education.

02:24:41.894 --> 02:24:44.055
What are some of your career goals,
may I ask?

02:24:44.163 --> 02:24:48.531
I want to fall back to,
like, make - have my own business.

02:24:48.633 --> 02:24:50.601
Like real estate.

02:24:53.404 --> 02:24:55.702
This is where it all happens.

02:24:55.807 --> 02:24:58.901
Beautiful place.
And it gets to rockin;

02:24:59.010 --> 02:25:01.911
- You gonna try it on there?
- Yeah.

02:25:02.013 --> 02:25:04.607
Those are about $ 120 apiece.

02:25:07.718 --> 02:25:10.278
You need to be very careful
with this decision.

02:25:10.388 --> 02:25:12.549
You know, if you come in and act right,
you're going out of here...

02:25:12.657 --> 02:25:14.556
with two years
of your college finished...

02:25:14.658 --> 02:25:18.321
a scholarship to a Division I university.

02:25:18.428 --> 02:25:22.728
Exactly where you'd want to be-
on track to graduate in four years.

02:25:49.258 --> 02:25:51.249
Mineral Area doesn't have dorms...

02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:54.386
but it does have a basketball house.

02:25:54.497 --> 02:25:58.092
All the ballplayers
on scholarship live here.

02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:00.634
Get your ass up, nigga.

02:26:04.707 --> 02:26:07.175
Of the seven blacks
in the entire school...

02:26:07.276 --> 02:26:09.244
six live in this house.

02:26:13.715 --> 02:26:18.084
You come in and look at this little house,
then after a while you get used to it.

02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:21.020
Try to make a little home, you know.

02:26:21.122 --> 02:26:23.056
Home away from home anyway.

02:26:26.261 --> 02:26:28.661
We hang around each other most of the time.

02:26:28.763 --> 02:26:30.993
We know who to trust,
who not to trust.

02:26:33.334 --> 02:26:36.565
I just want to go somewhere
where I'm gonna play.

02:26:36.671 --> 02:26:38.639
I can get the grades.

02:26:41.942 --> 02:26:43.910
I love basketball.

02:26:54.221 --> 02:26:56.415
How many of your
players that leave there

02:26:56.416 --> 02:26:58.658
and they end up going
to a four-year college?

02:26:58.759 --> 02:27:00.659
- Thirty-one sophomores in a row.
- Really?

02:27:00.761 --> 02:27:02.661
Every last one of 'em he coached.

02:27:02.763 --> 02:27:05.425
- hi. how you doing?
- Hey. how you doing?

02:27:05.532 --> 02:27:08.524
- Arthur Sr.
- Bo and Sheila have been separated.

02:27:08.635 --> 02:27:13.003
She asked him to return today
over Arthur's objections.

02:27:13.105 --> 02:27:15.369
I'll show you exactly
what the scholarship entails.

02:27:15.474 --> 02:27:18.238
Is this a full scholarship
for the two years?

02:27:18.344 --> 02:27:22.747
The reason I'm skeptical is because of
the promises that was made in the past.

02:27:22.848 --> 02:27:24.472
From the time he comes down there

02:27:24.473 --> 02:27:26.909
until he leaves, you will
not have a financial need.

02:27:27.019 --> 02:27:29.783
Now, when you make this decision...

02:27:29.889 --> 02:27:31.789
you got to live and die with it.

02:27:31.891 --> 02:27:33.791
'Cause it's your decision to make.

02:27:33.893 --> 02:27:37.954
Now, I'm here to support you if you -
if you done searched this whole thing.

02:27:38.064 --> 02:27:39.963
And it's what you really want.

02:27:40.065 --> 02:27:42.829
Not, you know,
'cause Mama said this or your dad-

02:27:42.934 --> 02:27:45.960
Or because you're saving
Mama money, because if we have to...

02:27:46.071 --> 02:27:48.335
we will still pay-
if you have to try to pay-

02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:50.465
if we can put some-
I'm just sayin;

02:27:50.575 --> 02:27:54.170
You - Understand what you're saying. You
want to save somebody money, but still -

02:27:54.279 --> 02:27:56.372
But you have to still do
what is best from here.

02:27:56.481 --> 02:27:59.917
But still we want the best for you -
even if you have to -

02:28:00.018 --> 02:28:02.282
or we have to go in the hole, you know.

02:28:02.387 --> 02:28:04.412
You understand what I'm
saying? I'm just saying.

02:28:04.413 --> 02:28:05.982
But still, the decision is up to you.

02:28:09.226 --> 02:28:11.820
So, what do you think?

02:28:11.929 --> 02:28:13.897
Ah.

02:28:16.100 --> 02:28:18.125
- Ready to sign it?
- Yeah.

02:28:19.203 --> 02:28:22.195
- Yep.
- Let's do it up.

02:28:27.711 --> 02:28:29.838
- What time is it?
- 1:56.

02:28:29.947 --> 02:28:31.915
56.

02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:46.289
Come on, Bo.
Whip it to him.

02:28:46.396 --> 02:28:48.796
When I was 23, how old was he?

02:28:48.898 --> 02:28:50.798
And I whupped him then.

02:28:52.802 --> 02:28:54.463
Aw!

02:28:54.570 --> 02:28:56.538
You want to see it rain?

02:28:56.639 --> 02:28:59.540
Let it rain.!

02:28:59.642 --> 02:29:02.076
- You want to see it rain?
- One more time.

02:29:02.178 --> 02:29:04.373
Let it rain!

02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:06.640
You want to see it rain?

02:29:06.748 --> 02:29:09.046
Let it rain!

02:29:09.151 --> 02:29:11.119
Oh!

02:29:12.921 --> 02:29:15.549
Peoria Manual.
Remember what they did to you now.

02:29:15.657 --> 02:29:17.750
Yeah. Do you know howard Nathan?

02:29:17.859 --> 02:29:20.487
And I strung him up,
just like that.

02:29:23.332 --> 02:29:27.393
Uh-oh. Like father, like son.
What's up with that?

02:29:27.502 --> 02:29:30.232
You better stick to church music,
leave that basketball alone.

02:29:35.710 --> 02:29:39.202
Hell, no. You can't do that.

02:29:39.313 --> 02:29:41.440
Foul! Foul!

02:29:43.284 --> 02:29:45.184
Foul. Foul, foul, foul.

02:29:45.286 --> 02:29:47.186
- That's 32.
- That's 34.

02:29:47.288 --> 02:29:49.188
- 34!
- That didn't count 'cause he called "Bo."

02:29:49.290 --> 02:29:51.724
- That's 34!
- That's 32!

02:29:51.826 --> 02:29:53.726
- he didn't hit nothing else.!
- I did!

02:29:53.828 --> 02:29:56.353
- he didn't hit nothing else!
- It's 34-28, Bo.

02:29:56.464 --> 02:29:58.364
- Bo's a sore loser.
- All right!

02:29:58.466 --> 02:30:01.799
- No. I know how to count though.
- Ain't no con game. I'm older now.

02:30:01.902 --> 02:30:03.994
- Yeah.
- Ain't no con game going on no more.

02:30:04.104 --> 02:30:07.232
- No more. Ain't no more.
- The score is 32 to 28.

02:30:07.340 --> 02:30:09.900
Now, you can play for 32 if you want to.

02:30:10.009 --> 02:30:12.375
Game over with.
I can con too.

02:30:12.479 --> 02:30:14.777
Losers quit. I'm ready to play.

02:30:14.881 --> 02:30:16.712
Now, youse a coward if you don't-
Check ball.

02:30:16.816 --> 02:30:18.943
- You're mad now.
- Check ball.

02:30:19.052 --> 02:30:19.920
- Throw it over there.

02:30:19.921 --> 02:30:22.249
- You ain't two years old.
You ain't gettin' no pacifier.

02:30:22.355 --> 02:30:24.255
- Give me that.
- Yeah.

02:30:24.357 --> 02:30:27.190
Your mama ain't here
to give you this ball. Let's go.

02:30:27.293 --> 02:30:29.818
- Give me the rock.
- Let's make it rain. Make it rain.

02:30:31.931 --> 02:30:34.398
Bang. Bang. Right there.

02:30:34.500 --> 02:30:37.469
Ha! Go sit down.
Go sit down.

02:30:37.569 --> 02:30:39.901
Bo, it's raining.!

02:30:40.005 --> 02:30:41.973
Bo, it's raining.

02:30:42.074 --> 02:30:43.974
- It's raining, Bo!
- It's raining, Bo!

02:30:44.076 --> 02:30:46.874
You're on punishment when you get home.
You're on punishment when you get home.

02:30:46.979 --> 02:30:50.710
And you're on punishment
when you get home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

02:30:52.151 --> 02:30:54.278
It's gonna rain on your head, Bo.

02:30:59.625 --> 02:31:01.751
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen...

02:31:01.859 --> 02:31:05.488
and welcome to St. Joseph's
Annual Basketball Awards Dinner.

02:31:05.596 --> 02:31:08.360
We had a...

02:31:08.466 --> 02:31:10.457
difficult year.

02:31:10.568 --> 02:31:12.468
Most of you are aware of that.

02:31:12.570 --> 02:31:13.898
When I first went to St. Joe's,

02:31:13.899 --> 02:31:15.733
I really did sleep, eat
and drink basketball.

02:31:15.840 --> 02:31:17.740
That was all I did.

02:31:17.842 --> 02:31:21.972
But it became more of a job
than a sport to play.

02:31:22.079 --> 02:31:25.014
Things here have not changed since-

02:31:25.116 --> 02:31:30.053
You know, Coach Pingatore
just had these dreams in his head.

02:31:32.055 --> 02:31:36.082
He just wanted me to go
the same route he took Isiah.

02:31:37.127 --> 02:31:39.960
The most steals.

02:31:40.063 --> 02:31:45.023
He played as a freshman.
Not even Isiah was a four-year starter.

02:31:45.135 --> 02:31:48.434
You know, basketball was just like-
he was possessed with it.

02:31:48.538 --> 02:31:50.597
You know, it was his life.

02:31:50.707 --> 02:31:53.301
And he wanted it to be
everybody else's life too.

02:31:53.410 --> 02:31:55.640
All-conference in the SCC.

02:31:55.745 --> 02:31:57.713
All-state in the Sun-Times.

02:31:57.814 --> 02:32:00.839
A McDonald All-American nomination.

02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:06.855
M. V.P., 1990-1991 season,
William Gates.

02:32:25.975 --> 02:32:28.034
When I had some real problems...

02:32:28.142 --> 02:32:30.576
I couldn't go to
none of them about it.

02:32:32.747 --> 02:32:36.080
You know, I was having some problems
with Catherine's family and my family...

02:32:36.184 --> 02:32:40.553
and I said, you know, "Coach Pingatore,
their family's been getting on me about...

02:32:40.655 --> 02:32:43.749
you know, I'm not doing this,
and I'm not doing that."

02:32:43.858 --> 02:32:46.292
And the only thing
Coach Pingatore could say is...

02:32:47.328 --> 02:32:49.228
"Write 'em off."

02:32:49.330 --> 02:32:50.819
That was all he told me.

02:32:50.820 --> 02:32:53.858
And I was, like, "What
kind of advice is that?"

02:32:58.105 --> 02:33:01.040
Well, how's it feel to be finishing?

02:33:03.243 --> 02:33:05.677
Uh, I mean-

02:33:07.514 --> 02:33:09.505
Now, don't say anything
you don't mean, William.

02:33:09.616 --> 02:33:12.585
I mean, I'm serious, Coach.
I enjoyed my four years.

02:33:12.686 --> 02:33:15.154
I mean, we had our run-ins, and, uh -

02:33:15.255 --> 02:33:17.155
- Who had run-ins?
- Me and you.

02:33:17.257 --> 02:33:17.859
- We did?

02:33:17.860 --> 02:33:20.420
- Yeah. Like that time
you made me run 75 stairs.

02:33:20.527 --> 02:33:22.495
- I never f-
- You never forgot that.

02:33:22.596 --> 02:33:24.496
Never.

02:33:24.598 --> 02:33:27.505
See, you should have been
happy and enthusiastic

02:33:27.506 --> 02:33:29.159
about doing your punishment.

02:33:29.268 --> 02:33:33.762
But someday
you're gonna learn that, uh...

02:33:33.873 --> 02:33:36.137
everything that was done
was for your benefit.

02:33:36.242 --> 02:33:39.187
So that you can come
back four years from now

02:33:39.188 --> 02:33:41.111
and say, "Coach, you were right.

02:33:41.213 --> 02:33:43.647
"Everything that happened
at St. Joe's helped me a lot...

02:33:43.749 --> 02:33:45.717
and as a result I got a degree. '"

02:33:45.818 --> 02:33:47.718
That's what I'm hoping for.

02:33:47.820 --> 02:33:50.152
I'm going into communication...

02:33:50.256 --> 02:33:54.317
so when you start asking for a donation,
I'll know the right way to turn you down.

02:33:54.427 --> 02:33:57.361
I'm sure you'll never turn us down.

02:33:57.462 --> 02:33:59.362
Ah.

02:34:01.399 --> 02:34:06.166
I never really felt
that he bought into the system.

02:34:06.271 --> 02:34:09.707
He was never convinced what he was
doing was the right thing to do.

02:34:10.742 --> 02:34:14.007
But overall he had a good career-
not a great career.

02:34:14.112 --> 02:34:16.012
It's never good-bye.

02:34:16.114 --> 02:34:19.015
Could've been different
if the injury didn't occur.

02:34:19.117 --> 02:34:21.210
But it did occur.

02:34:21.319 --> 02:34:24.412
- And that was the big difference.
- I'm proud of what you did.

02:34:24.521 --> 02:34:26.682
- Okay.
- I expect you to do a lot better.

02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:28.690
I don't want this to be the-

02:34:28.792 --> 02:34:30.760
- Yeah.
- You know, the highlight of your career.

02:34:30.861 --> 02:34:33.557
You've got a lot of
bigger and better things to do.

02:34:33.664 --> 02:34:36.064
I'll see you later.
Good luck.

02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:41.338
Well...

02:34:42.606 --> 02:34:45.734
another one walks out the door,
and another one comes in the door.

02:34:45.843 --> 02:34:47.777
That's what it's all about.

02:35:26.248 --> 02:35:28.216
It came through for me.

02:35:28.316 --> 02:35:30.784
- Got the score I needed.
- All right.

02:35:30.886 --> 02:35:32.786
And, hey...

02:35:33.822 --> 02:35:35.722
I'm eligible.

02:35:36.992 --> 02:35:39.583
You know, this is one
of the greatest feelings

02:35:39.584 --> 02:35:41.292
in the world. That's about it.

02:35:41.396 --> 02:35:43.296
I mean -

02:35:45.167 --> 02:35:49.001
After five attempts,
William's composite score of 17.5...

02:35:49.104 --> 02:35:51.003
is rounded up to 18...

02:35:51.105 --> 02:35:54.836
and he can finally accept a scholarship
to play at Marquette.

02:36:20.333 --> 02:36:22.893
I think my mom...

02:36:23.002 --> 02:36:26.768
all through high school
really, really was proud of me.

02:36:26.873 --> 02:36:29.740
She said, "Everybody's throwing
their dreams into you...

02:36:29.843 --> 02:36:33.279
but you got to throw
your own dreams into yourself. '"

02:36:42.222 --> 02:36:45.282
When I gave her the diploma
after the graduation...

02:36:45.391 --> 02:36:49.918
she was, like,
"This is it, one of my proudest moments. '"

02:37:03.308 --> 02:37:05.435
My baby graduated.

02:37:09.848 --> 02:37:12.817
Curtis always wanted to go to Marquette...

02:37:12.918 --> 02:37:15.819
and his grades weren't
good enough for him to go...

02:37:15.921 --> 02:37:19.913
and now it's like
he got the grades, you know?

02:37:22.093 --> 02:37:25.256
Excuse me, Curtis.
You gonna give anybody else a chance?

02:37:25.363 --> 02:37:28.423
What two countries
are we competing with for world trade?

02:37:28.533 --> 02:37:31.969
Before Arthur can graduate,
he must pass summer school.

02:37:32.069 --> 02:37:35.300
And for the first time in three years,
Shannon isn't there with him.

02:37:35.406 --> 02:37:37.374
The other country, of course, we said-

02:37:37.475 --> 02:37:41.275
he thought he could sell drugs
and don't get caught, you know.

02:37:41.379 --> 02:37:43.279
But he found out the hard way.

02:37:43.381 --> 02:37:45.213
And I told him, while
he was doing all that -

02:37:45.214 --> 02:37:46.646
I wasn't hanging with Shannon then.

02:37:46.751 --> 02:37:49.417
I was like, man, "Shannon,
you should stop, man.

02:37:49.418 --> 02:37:50.777
Stop doing that stuff."

02:37:54.224 --> 02:37:58.126
We always said we weren't
gonna never do no stuff like that.

02:37:58.228 --> 02:38:02.130
We were just gonna go on
and graduate and go on to college.

02:38:02.232 --> 02:38:05.599
But, you know, he had to be the one.

02:38:16.045 --> 02:38:20.175
One week before his graduation,
Arthur is robbed at gunpoint.

02:38:21.217 --> 02:38:24.914
At first I thought he was gonna shoot me
because I didn't have no money.

02:38:25.955 --> 02:38:29.482
'Cause he kept asking me, "You got -
You got some money. Where your wallet at?"

02:38:29.592 --> 02:38:31.873
Be like, "What you driving
a car like this for?"

02:38:31.874 --> 02:38:33.688
I was, like, "I ain't got no wallet."

02:38:36.832 --> 02:38:39.460
And then, you know,
he grabbed me and stuff, and I was-

02:38:39.568 --> 02:38:43.937
and I was about to panic and stuff,
and I just calmed down.

02:38:47.508 --> 02:38:50.944
I sit down and had a long
talk with him and his sister.

02:38:51.045 --> 02:38:54.503
Someone pulled a pistol on her
right down the street from the house.

02:38:55.617 --> 02:38:58.599
I said, "Do you all
understand what is going on

02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:00.645
out here in these streets today?'"

02:39:00.755 --> 02:39:05.192
Even with me, when I was out there -
you know, out there strung out -

02:39:05.293 --> 02:39:09.024
you know, I looked for somebody
that seemed like they had something.

02:39:10.632 --> 02:39:15.000
Hmm. After this, I -

02:39:15.102 --> 02:39:19.266
I - I'm ready.
I'm ready to leave.

02:39:19.373 --> 02:39:21.273
'Cause there ain't no -

02:39:21.375 --> 02:39:25.402
Everybody up here going to jail
or-or either in drugs.

02:39:26.446 --> 02:39:28.414
Or dead.

02:40:05.451 --> 02:40:07.419
James Davis.

02:40:19.130 --> 02:40:21.655
Arthur Agee.

02:40:23.835 --> 02:40:27.601
Please hold your applause
so everyone can hear.

02:40:27.706 --> 02:40:29.674
Christine Bowman.

02:40:32.177 --> 02:40:34.145
Erica Byrd.

02:40:37.082 --> 02:40:39.243
Sandra Crockett.

02:40:41.018 --> 02:40:45.512
I never thought he would
get to the place where he's at now.

02:40:47.658 --> 02:40:52.721
Arthur's self-esteem
was really drained from St. Joseph's.

02:40:52.830 --> 02:40:55.390
I said, "Well, you are somebody.

02:40:55.499 --> 02:40:58.263
"No matter where you go,
it's what you have in your heart...

02:40:58.369 --> 02:41:01.099
that you're gonna go somewhere. '"

02:41:13.950 --> 02:41:16.510
Come on.
Move out of the way, boy.

02:41:20.790 --> 02:41:22.556
Everybody out there, there's gonna be

02:41:22.557 --> 02:41:24.851
a party tonight. There's
gonna be a party tonight.

02:41:24.961 --> 02:41:26.861
You know it.

02:41:26.963 --> 02:41:29.659
These flame-broiled burgers -

02:42:00.062 --> 02:42:01.962
It's scary, man. I'm telling you.

02:42:02.064 --> 02:42:04.532
I'm telling you the truth.
Scary generation, man.

02:42:05.767 --> 02:42:08.014
- I thought you might
hit me in my head, fool.

02:42:08.015 --> 02:42:09.497
- I didn't hit you in your head.

02:42:09.603 --> 02:42:11.628
To my son.

02:42:11.739 --> 02:42:15.231
I hope you pursue all your dreams
and your desires...

02:42:15.342 --> 02:42:17.310
that you have within you.

02:42:17.411 --> 02:42:19.675
I love you very much.

02:42:19.780 --> 02:42:23.443
- Ooh, that is so nice.
- Whatever.

02:42:23.551 --> 02:42:26.042
Oh, no.!

02:42:44.971 --> 02:42:47.235
God, we thank you
for this day, Lord.

02:42:47.340 --> 02:42:49.934
And we ask you to
go with junior, Lord.

02:42:50.043 --> 02:42:53.706
And we thank you, Lord. Go with him
as he try to better his education, Lord.

02:42:53.813 --> 02:42:56.441
And we thank you for him
for coming this far.

02:42:56.549 --> 02:42:58.540
We came this far by faith, Lord.

02:42:58.651 --> 02:43:01.347
And we ask you, Father,
when he get in college, Lord...

02:43:01.454 --> 02:43:03.649
to keep him, Lord-
keep him protected.

02:43:03.756 --> 02:43:05.656
We thank you for him, Jesus.

02:43:05.758 --> 02:43:08.726
- In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
- Amen.

02:43:08.827 --> 02:43:12.854
Oh, you can cry like a river, girl.

02:43:12.965 --> 02:43:15.490
You're crying so bad,
I won't even make fun of you.

02:43:21.807 --> 02:43:23.775
Oh, God.

02:43:41.993 --> 02:43:44.461
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.

02:43:45.496 --> 02:43:47.521
I want you to be good, okay?

02:43:47.632 --> 02:43:52.831
And don't, uh, get mixed up in
none of that old stuff that, uh, you know.

02:43:52.937 --> 02:43:55.633
I done told you what to do.

02:43:55.740 --> 02:43:59.039
Don't get no alcohol, no wine coolers.

02:43:59.143 --> 02:44:01.737
None of that stuff.

02:44:19.329 --> 02:44:21.297
Bye-bye.

02:44:25.669 --> 02:44:29.662
I just hope he stay in there.
That's what worries me most.

02:44:31.441 --> 02:44:35.206
Once he get in the door,
I want him to stay in there for four years.

02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:40.475
Think he gonna make it?

02:44:40.583 --> 02:44:42.551
You do?

02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:46.788
I think he gonna make it.

02:44:48.557 --> 02:44:50.525
Well, I hope so anyway.

02:45:18.219 --> 02:45:22.383
When I was young-When I was little,
that's all I used to think about-the NBA.

02:45:24.759 --> 02:45:27.091
If I set my mind, I can - I can go.

02:45:27.195 --> 02:45:29.095
I can st - I can go.

02:45:29.197 --> 02:45:31.528
Get in good college. I can go.

02:45:32.633 --> 02:45:36.125
But if I don't, you know, I ain't gonna be
no drug dealer, you know...

02:45:36.236 --> 02:45:39.137
cry about it,
come back and, you know...

02:45:39.239 --> 02:45:42.504
stick up gas stations
or nothing like that, you know.

02:45:42.609 --> 02:45:45.703
Probably go into comedian or architecture,
something like that.

02:45:50.784 --> 02:45:53.156
You don't think that
you'll have the kind of

02:45:53.169 --> 02:45:55.551
tough times like your
dad's been through?

02:45:55.656 --> 02:45:58.352
No.

02:45:58.458 --> 02:46:02.757
I can't say-I can't say that I will.
I can't say that I don't. I don't know.

02:46:28.020 --> 02:46:29.812
Four years ago, that's all

02:46:29.813 --> 02:46:32.718
I used to dream about
was playing in the NBA.

02:46:32.824 --> 02:46:35.190
I don't really dream about it
like that anymore.

02:46:36.227 --> 02:46:38.957
You know, even though...

02:46:39.064 --> 02:46:41.999
I love playing basketball, but, you know...

02:46:42.100 --> 02:46:44.830
I want to do other things
with my life too.

02:46:44.936 --> 02:46:46.995
- Say, "hi, Daddy. '"
- Hi, Daddy.

02:46:47.105 --> 02:46:49.403
- "how you doing?'"
- How you doing?

02:46:49.507 --> 02:46:51.407
- Say, "I love you. '"
- I love you.

02:46:52.510 --> 02:46:56.810
If I had to stop playing basketball
right now, I think I'd still be happy.

02:46:56.915 --> 02:46:59.747
- I think I would.
- Thank you, Daddy.

02:46:59.850 --> 02:47:02.580
- Where'd Daddy get to?
- Uh, Marquette.

02:47:02.686 --> 02:47:04.654
Marquette?

02:47:06.690 --> 02:47:09.056
That's why when
somebody say, you know...

02:47:09.159 --> 02:47:10.286
"When you get to the NBA,

02:47:10.287 --> 02:47:12.219
don't forget about me,
'"and all that stuff...

02:47:12.329 --> 02:47:14.635
I should say to them,
"Well, if I don't make it,

02:47:14.636 --> 02:47:16.231
watch you don't forget about me. '"
