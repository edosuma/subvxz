WEBVTT

00:05.756 --> 00:08.851
LANA: Archer, do something.
ARCHER: Sure thing, Lana.

00:09.009 --> 00:13.139
Oh, wait, I can't, because I left my
lightsaber in my other space pants!

00:13.305 --> 00:15.603
Don't yell at me, this was your idea!
What?

00:15.766 --> 00:18.485
Remind me, when was it
that I said, "Guys, great idea.

00:18.644 --> 00:21.614
Let's get shanghaied
to go live on fricking Mars!"

00:21.772 --> 00:24.616
KELLOGG: Keep moving.
Make me-- Ow!

00:24.775 --> 00:26.652
Heh, heh. He said "meow."

00:26.818 --> 00:30.698
Moving. Yes, and how can I help you
not ever do that again, please?

00:30.864 --> 00:33.458
Get in there.
In here sounds great.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.795
Are the cuffs really necessary?

00:36.954 --> 00:38.752
Archer broke both of Wu's arms.

00:38.914 --> 00:41.463
He what?
While shouting "whoo!"

00:41.625 --> 00:42.968
Happy coincidence.

00:43.126 --> 00:47.176
Mr. Archer, do I have to sedate you?
Well, I wouldn't say no to a drink.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.966
Archer.
What, you want one?

00:49.132 --> 00:50.634
Okay, can we get two, um...

00:50.801 --> 00:53.429
My tongue says sangrita,
but my heart says...

00:53.595 --> 00:54.847
Archer.
...michelada.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.482
You realize this is kidnapping.
I do, yes.

00:57.641 --> 01:00.770
And do you realize you're insane?
He wouldn't, by definition--

01:00.936 --> 01:05.783
What's more insane? Suffering through
famine, war, disease on a dying Earth...

01:05.941 --> 01:08.615
...or creating a utopia on Mars?

01:08.777 --> 01:11.326
Using me as
your brood sow?

01:11.488 --> 01:13.991
No, not--
Well, okay, yes, technically.

01:14.157 --> 01:18.162
But we searched for so long to find
the perfect human female specimen.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.456
Well, that's
ﬂattering-ish.

01:20.622 --> 01:24.001
And with your morphology,
your IQ, your medical history--

01:24.167 --> 01:26.090
How'd you get
my medical records?

01:26.253 --> 01:29.052
Don't judge me on the how,
until you see the why.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.560
Oh, Krieger-san!
I never judge you!

01:33.719 --> 01:35.847
Well, your mother
sure as hell does!

01:36.013 --> 01:38.687
How isn't important.
What is important--

01:38.849 --> 01:43.150
ls you hired ISIS just so Lana could
pump out a bunch of Martian babies?

01:43.312 --> 01:48.614
Only if by "Martian" you mean "born on Mars,"
not actual alien life forms.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.277
Oh. Whatever. Either way.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.038
My point is this whole thing is Lana's fault...
What?

01:53.196 --> 01:56.541
...and you don't need more dudes on Mars--
Archer!

01:56.700 --> 02:00.705
Lana, the penis-to-your-vagina ratio
around here is creepy enough already...

02:00.871 --> 02:02.544
...so why not let us three go--

02:02.706 --> 02:05.175
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Or just me.

02:05.334 --> 02:08.133
Because even if we didn't need
all the manpower we can get...

02:08.294 --> 02:10.423
...there's no ship
to take you back to Earth.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.057
Yeah, no, the shuttle, it's--

02:12.215 --> 02:15.059
It's going to push the Horizon
into orbit above Mars...

02:15.218 --> 02:18.392
...to serve as our base
while we begin the terraforming.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.681
Which reminds me.

02:19.848 --> 02:23.478
Commander Kellogg, there are
three women on the Intrepid.

02:23.644 --> 02:27.148
<i>Take</i> a <i>boarding party and bring them</i>
<i>back here to join their friends.</i>

02:27.314 --> 02:28.907
Holy shit-space!

02:29.066 --> 02:30.943
Hey, guys. we got a problem!

02:31.109 --> 02:34.613
Duh. The party's starting, and this
dress makes me look like a whore!

02:34.780 --> 02:36.782
Oh, you don't look
like a whore.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.495
An idiot, maybe.
Wha--?

02:38.659 --> 02:39.751
Or both.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.663
Yes, a "whordiot."

03:21.993 --> 03:23.495
DRAKE:
Agent Kane, I--

03:23.662 --> 03:25.209
May I call you Lana?

03:25.372 --> 03:26.874
You absolutely may not.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.463
Fair enough,
but I wish you'd reconsider.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.924
You'd be much more
comfortable in my quarters.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.589
Ha! You'll have to sedate me.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.223
No, no, no, we wouldn't do that.

03:35.382 --> 03:39.137
We need you in peak physical condition
for this great undertaking of ours.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.349
All of you.

03:40.512 --> 03:43.140
So wait, are we not doing drinks?

03:43.306 --> 03:47.652
Ha! I'm not helping you terraform Mars.
I won't move one cup of dirt.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.154
Can we at least have beers?

03:49.312 --> 03:50.985
Then you can join the, um...

03:51.148 --> 03:54.072
Well, we're calling them
"involuntary laborers."

03:54.276 --> 03:55.949
lnvol-- Wait, you mean slaves?

03:56.111 --> 03:57.488
Oh, now he's indignant.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.658
Please, all you have to do
is sit around all day getting laid.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.327
Involuntary labor is just
a temporary measure.

04:03.493 --> 04:06.667
In a few generations,
after the colony is established...

04:06.830 --> 04:09.083
...we'll revisit the issue.
In the meantime--

04:09.249 --> 04:10.922
You can kiss three-fifths of my ass.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.257
KELLOGG :
Uh, Tony, we've got a problem.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.093
Ugh. What now?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.677
I'm on my way.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.012
And the black guy
is okay with this?

04:19.176 --> 04:23.056
Ugh.
What? Oh, for-- How was that racist?

04:23.221 --> 04:26.100
It's just a temporary measure.
I didn't say anything.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.110
Hello, uh, miss?
This is Commander Kellogg.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.239
I need you to move the locking lever
from "manual" to "auto."

04:32.397 --> 04:34.866
<i>PAM :
"Auto." Got it. Moving the lever.</i>

04:35.233 --> 04:38.032
Uh, clunk. Did that do it?

04:38.195 --> 04:39.697
<i>KELLOGG:
Did you move the--?</i>

04:39.863 --> 04:41.206
Boring conversation anyway.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.741
What the hell are you doing?

04:42.908 --> 04:46.538
These nutsacks wanna take us
to Mars to be baby factories.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.795
Really?

04:47.954 --> 04:51.049
I can't go live on Mars.
I just rented a summer house.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.960
Really?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.298
No.

04:54.461 --> 04:58.216
Oh, whatever. Come on,
we gotta figure a way out of this.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.758
Or do we?

04:59.925 --> 05:00.972
ARCHER: Yes.
LANA: No!

05:01.134 --> 05:03.728
Why is nobody else wearing
a T-shirt under their suit?

05:03.887 --> 05:06.310
Because this thing feels amazing.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.773
I know, right?
It's like a vagina with a zipper.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.404
Ew.
Lana, trust me, this is the only way.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.985
Ugh. All right. But turn around.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.277
"Turn around"? It's not like
we haven't all seen them before.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.116
Don't remind me.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.913
Okay, there.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.495
Although, I guess it has been a long time.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.750
Meaning?

05:25.909 --> 05:30.164
Nothing, just bet you're glad
we're in reduced gravity.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.421
Well, I didn't invent the ravages of time.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.176
Okay, Ray, Cyril, get ready.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.179
Lana, uh, pretend it's five years ago.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.763
I wish it was, so I could murder you
before we ever dated.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.141
Uh, excuse me, could I borrow you?

05:45.303 --> 05:47.476
No, you cannot borrow-- Oh, my God!

05:47.639 --> 05:49.061
LANA:
Yeah, right?

05:49.724 --> 05:50.896
Okay, what seems to be the--?

05:52.269 --> 05:53.270
GUARD:
Aah! My eye!

05:53.436 --> 05:55.689
ARCHER:
Somebody get his goddamn gun!

05:55.856 --> 05:58.279
LANA: Oh, for the love of--!
ARCHER: Ow! You dick!

05:59.609 --> 06:00.781
GUARD:
Ow! My other eye!

06:00.944 --> 06:02.446
I'm almost certainly blind.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.785
Serves you right. Anybody else hit?

06:04.948 --> 06:06.621
No, I'm good.
Yeah, uh, me too.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.330
That's because you hid, Cyril.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.837
Otherwise, I think that all
went pretty great.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.122
Right?
LANA: Really?

06:12.289 --> 06:14.291
ARCHER:
Heh, heh. Do you not'?

06:14.457 --> 06:16.050
"Do you not?"
Just give me the damn--

06:17.419 --> 06:19.547
T-shirt.
Sorry, it's been commandeered.

06:19.713 --> 06:24.719
What the hell am I supposed to wear?
Uh... Oh, maybe this will work.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.230
Yeah, I think that totally works.
Stole them from the gift shop.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.982
If you're done being an asshole,
help me strip this guy so I can--

06:32.309 --> 06:35.279
<i>What the--?
COMPUTER : Security breach, Pod 6.</i>

06:35.437 --> 06:36.984
We gotta move! Come on!

06:37.772 --> 06:38.819
Lana, let's go!

06:38.982 --> 06:40.984
Wait! Let me just get-- Damn it!

06:44.654 --> 06:46.372
<i>Ow.</i>

06:47.824 --> 06:49.826
Well, now they're droopier.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.666
Aw.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.625
<i>COMPUTER :
Security breach, Pod 6.</i>

06:56.791 --> 06:58.509
DRAKE:
No, no, no, now what?

06:58.668 --> 07:01.171
<i>Security breach, Pod 6.
I heard you.</i>

07:01.338 --> 07:05.309
I don't care if you have to use
the plasma torch, get this door open.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.346
Security team, this is Commander Drake.
Converge on Pod 6.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.639
You heard him,
get this door open.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.478
Sure thing, boss man.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.939
Oh, my God, for the last time--

07:15.101 --> 07:16.694
We can't...

07:17.020 --> 07:18.067
...fight them off.

07:18.229 --> 07:22.405
That's what Dad said when the bank man
came out to foreclose on the farm.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.202
And guess how that turned out.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.034
You murdered a banker?

07:26.196 --> 07:27.823
No, we got a loan modification.

07:27.989 --> 07:32.165
You think a bank wants to own a failing
dairy farm with obsolete milkers?

07:32.327 --> 07:34.170
Oh, my God, speaking of--

07:34.329 --> 07:37.173
<i>They're right where they've always been.</i>

07:37.332 --> 07:39.380
Wait, can she hear us?
Man, I hope not.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.045
Lana.
Guess not.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.385
<i>ARCHER : Will you come on?
Grr!</i>

07:44.547 --> 07:46.265
Don't get me wrong.
I'd still do her.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.097
Oh, please, you'd do...

07:48.259 --> 07:49.476
Name a noun.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.229
No, you look.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.857
You look at these
and tell me they're not perfect!

07:54.015 --> 07:55.232
Now? Really?

07:55.392 --> 07:58.066
Jesus God, are you that insecure?

07:58.228 --> 08:01.357
No! I'm not! Because I am--
Ready!

08:01.523 --> 08:03.571
Oh, man.
Uh, thoughts?

08:04.859 --> 08:07.237
Through there! Go!
Uh, nope.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.701
Aim!

08:08.863 --> 08:11.366
Why not?
It's full of, ugh, garbage and shit.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.206
You got a better idea?

08:13.368 --> 08:16.247
Well, we could eat a big bowl
of hepatitises A through E.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.585
Or just run away.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.751
Just because it was my idea, you--
Guys.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.339
GUARD:
Fire!

08:22.502 --> 08:23.594
Oh, shit.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.723
KELLOGG:
What's taking so long?

08:27.882 --> 08:28.929
Couple things.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.595
One, I didn't invent whatever
this door is made of...

08:31.761 --> 08:34.684
...which is apparently some alloy
of adamantium and mithril.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.850
And two,
not really liking your tone.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.769
<i>DRAKE:
Ugh, you idiots.</i>

08:38.934 --> 08:42.610
Firing an ion cannon
at the future Mother of Mars?

08:42.772 --> 08:45.366
Whose idea was that?
Ahem. Dave's.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.120
Oh. Well, that's just great, Dave.

08:49.279 --> 08:54.536
Tell me, if you kill her, who's gonna
bear our Martian children? Huh? Trish?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.286
Ew.
Ew.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.127
Archer! Sorry, go on, Trish.

08:59.289 --> 09:04.136
We've been locked in here
ever since you idiots took over Horizon.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.967
Tone.
Yeah, sorry.

09:06.129 --> 09:09.724
But Drake wants to use the Intrepid
to push Horizon to Mars...

09:09.883 --> 09:11.635
...so tell us how we can stop him.

09:11.801 --> 09:15.601
Yeah, can Cyril die after shutting
down the tractor beam, or...?

09:15.764 --> 09:18.938
Ugh! The Intrepid is the key to Drake's plan...

09:19.100 --> 09:22.980
...and he and Kellogg are
the only ones who can ﬂy it.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.820
So why aren't
you A-holes down there?

09:25.982 --> 09:27.825
Heh, heh. Burn.
Cyril.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.657
Although, good point, Trish.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.572
Okay, to the Intrepid. Let's go.

09:34.991 --> 09:39.872
Oh, and, Trish? Uh, with your looks,
maybe bitchy is not the way to go.

09:40.038 --> 09:43.508
GILLETTE:
Okay, you're the prettiest! Come on!

09:43.666 --> 09:46.670
I thought I'd made myself very clear.
You did, but--

09:46.836 --> 09:50.306
Then why isn't the airlock open?

09:50.548 --> 09:52.346
Dwarven technology.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.853
<i>What was that? What did you say?
Tony, stop.</i>

09:55.011 --> 09:59.517
See? Now we just wait for Mr. Archer
to save the day, like he always does.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.400
I don't know about always but--

10:01.559 --> 10:03.152
Are you sure they can't get in?

10:03.311 --> 10:04.563
Didn't you hear him? He said--

10:05.939 --> 10:09.159
DRAKE: Say "dwarven technology" again!
What the--?

10:09.317 --> 10:12.571
Stop this at once.
We command you.

10:12.737 --> 10:13.829
I'm sorry?
Unh.

10:13.988 --> 10:17.037
Wait, we're sorry. Aren't you guys
looking for a new Martian queen?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.292
PAM:
Goddamn it.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.375
Why, yes, and you're...?
Your Majesty.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.040
Your Majesty.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.379
And you're just so...

10:25.542 --> 10:27.135
What's the word
I'm looking for?

10:27.293 --> 10:30.297
Don't say "whordiot." We hate that.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.965
Majestic.
Right.

10:32.132 --> 10:36.012
Now follow me. We got a big list
of must-haves for the royal palace.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.101
Uh, your wish is my command.
CHERYL: Duh.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.438
Seal the door behind me
and prepare Horizon for launch.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.023
Next stop, Mars.

10:45.186 --> 10:48.030
Okay, you heard him.
Uh, I heard him tell you to do it.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.736
And I'm telling you to do it.

10:49.899 --> 10:53.324
And I'm telling you that I didn't
sign up for <i>Animal</i> Farm in space.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.159
Wait, there are animals?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.164
<i>No, Animal Farm.</i>

10:57.323 --> 11:00.577
How do you not get that?
Cyril, I know what an animal farm is.

11:00.743 --> 11:01.995
Not an animal farm.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.507
Maybe we can, I don't know,
stampede a ﬂock of goats down the hall.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.212
<i>Animal Farm is a book.</i>

11:07.375 --> 11:08.922
No, it isn't, Lana.

11:09.085 --> 11:13.261
It's an allegorical novella
about Stalinism by George Orwell!

11:13.423 --> 11:15.517
And spoiler alert, it sucks!

11:16.551 --> 11:20.647
Although I was talking about
an actual animal farm.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.773
So never mind.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.061
Oh, don't mind me, ma'ams.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.571
Just adjusting the climate control.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.028
Ooh, yes.
Another palace must-have.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.070
Now, we heard some
mention of babies?

11:34.235 --> 11:38.081
Uh-huh.
But just to be clear, we don't do babies.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.707
"Do" as in...?

11:39.866 --> 11:41.789
"Do" as in tolerate, be around, touch...

11:41.951 --> 11:45.125
...and as in let them claw
their monster-y way out of our vagina.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.006
Well, let's put a pin in that.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.417
Ew!

11:48.583 --> 11:49.960
Wait, put a pin in what?

11:50.126 --> 11:52.800
What? What is wrong with you?
And where are the other two--?

11:54.172 --> 11:55.549
Right here, space-nuts.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.968
Pamela, stop.
Your queen commands you.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.637
Oh, please, you're not fit
to be queen of...

12:00.803 --> 12:02.555
Name a place.
Lidsville.

12:02.722 --> 12:08.274
And, Drake, you can forget all about
your crazy little Martian sex cult.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.779
Ugh. It's not--

12:09.938 --> 12:11.781
Don't you people get it?

12:11.940 --> 12:13.442
Earth is doomed.

12:13.608 --> 12:18.489
Mankind's only hope for survival is
to find a new home on Mars...

12:18.655 --> 12:21.704
...and I am the only man alive
who can lead us there.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.493
I am like, uh...

12:23.660 --> 12:25.583
Jesus Christ.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.339
Well, I think a more apt analogy
would be Moses, but--

12:28.498 --> 12:30.341
Drop your weapon.
Make me.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.377
No, don't make her.
Come on, Pam.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.635
Pam, shoot!

12:33.795 --> 12:34.842
Mother!
Malory!

12:35.004 --> 12:36.927
Pam!
MALORY: And she'll do it too.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.765
CHERYL: She'll do anything to keep us
from the throne which is our birthright.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.349
Ew, birth.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.691
All right!
No, no, no. What are you doing?

12:47.850 --> 12:53.232
No, no! No, even if they kill me,
they can never kill our dream.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.608
Mars!

12:55.775 --> 12:57.652
Uh, hang on, sorry, one sec.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.663
Drones? You wanna...?
Thank you, thank you.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.954
Thanks a lot. Thank you.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.712
There is no Mars without you,
Tony. I'm sorry.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.707
Sorry? You're sorry?

13:10.873 --> 13:14.719
You just single-handedly doomed mankind!

13:14.877 --> 13:18.848
Even so, black astronaut, that's pretty huge.
It actually is.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.726
And at least your own mother didn't
just play chicken with your life!

13:21.884 --> 13:24.558
Heh, heh. Self-burn.
Cyril!

13:24.721 --> 13:29.852
Drake, you're gonna fly us back to Earth
to stand trial for, whatever, space piracy.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.112
No man can judge me.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.522
Well, you say that, but--

13:33.688 --> 13:35.986
Mars forever!

13:37.734 --> 13:39.327
Suppressing fire!

13:39.485 --> 13:41.237
CHERYL:
Cyril, stop!

13:45.241 --> 13:47.164
I think I got them. Did I get them?

13:47.327 --> 13:50.797
You did. You got those two guys,
who were just minding their own business.

13:50.955 --> 13:55.506
Ooh. And also the one remaining person
who could fly us back to Earth!

13:55.668 --> 13:58.672
A black astronaut, Cyril.
That's like killing a unicorn.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.261
Aw, crap-snacks!
How could this get--?

14:01.424 --> 14:04.268
Don't say it! Do not say it!

14:04.844 --> 14:07.267
MAN :
Gone to outer <i>space</i>

14:07.430 --> 14:11.685
<i>To shoot that dickbag in his face</i>

14:13.061 --> 14:14.529
Hang on, Other Barry.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.813
Uh, this is Barry.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.824
Hey, pumpkin pie! What's that?

14:18.983 --> 14:22.704
No. No, I'm in, uh, London for wor--

14:22.862 --> 14:23.954
What?

14:24.113 --> 14:27.492
Heh, Katya, pumpkin, I promised
I'd stop trying to kill Archer.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.795
Yes. Yes, both Barrys promised.

14:31.954 --> 14:36.630
What? Wait, what's wrong
with the sofa we already have?

14:36.793 --> 14:39.012
Oh, hey, hon, you're breaking up.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.265
Any worse.
ls what I was gonna say.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.804
Really?

14:48.429 --> 14:49.681
Yes.

14:55.645 --> 14:58.865
ARCHER:
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?

15:00.274 --> 15:01.446
Hello, is this airboats?

15:01.609 --> 15:04.237
Yeah, hi, it's me, Spacebot.

15:04.404 --> 15:09.126
What? Oh, just lifting a thousand pounds
like it's an apple, no big deal.

15:09.283 --> 15:13.629
Archer! Quit screwing around with the robot
and shut the damn airlock already!

15:13.788 --> 15:15.665
ARCHER:
Five more minutes! God.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.631
What's the hurry?
We're all gonna die up here anyway.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.138
We're gonna die!

15:22.296 --> 15:24.765
We're not gonna die!
Stop crying!

15:24.924 --> 15:28.019
For what it's worth, I think you
would've made a great Martian queen.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.645
Duh!

15:29.804 --> 15:30.851
Okay.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.732
LANA: Yeah. So, Trish?
What?

15:33.891 --> 15:35.017
Still with the tone.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.312
ARCHER:
Okay, the airlock's closed. Happy?

15:37.478 --> 15:40.527
So, seriously, none of you
know how to fly this thing?

15:40.690 --> 15:44.786
<i>No. We're scientists. We never
even trained on the simulator.</i>

15:45.069 --> 15:48.198
The simulator.
Guys, I can ﬂy us home.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.707
I will fly us home.

15:49.866 --> 15:50.867
Wait, what is this?

15:52.243 --> 15:53.290
And that?

15:53.453 --> 15:54.705
But right now this?

15:54.871 --> 15:58.125
He was really good in the simulator.
Right up until he crashed it.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.670
Thanks to you and your fire extinguisher.
Right?

16:01.836 --> 16:02.962
Okay, then it's settled.

16:03.129 --> 16:06.224
So, Trish,
Horizon is self-sustaining, right?

16:06.382 --> 16:08.259
Duh.
Well, then, have fun.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.894
Wait, wait, wait!

16:10.052 --> 16:13.807
Uh-- Never mind. I'm sure someone
is gonna feed the farm animals.

16:15.683 --> 16:19.904
Cyril, you're in command, try not to kill us.
Everybody else, strap in.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.188
Really?

16:21.355 --> 16:22.777
I said in, not on.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.658
Oh.
And ew.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.909
And-- Malory!

16:27.570 --> 16:31.416
I'm going into stasis.
Wake me up when we're on the ground.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.545
Preferably above 72nd Street.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.335
What is that? Who's got beer?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.421
BARRY :

16:41.167 --> 16:43.261
<i>
Come out to play.</i>

16:43.419 --> 16:44.511

16:44.670 --> 16:47.594
 Come on out, Archer.
<i>I</i> mean, I'd come in, <i>but.</i> ...

16:47.757 --> 16:50.431
<i>Yeah. Who built this door,
space dwarves?</i>

16:50.593 --> 16:53.938
Okay, Barry. Forgetting for the moment
how you found me here...

16:54.388 --> 16:55.435
HOLOGRAM:
Krieger-san!

16:56.933 --> 16:58.731
You wanna finish this?

16:58.893 --> 17:01.237
<i>Yeah, I do. Yeah. That's why I'm here-</i>

17:01.395 --> 17:02.772
Not for long, you're not.

17:02.939 --> 17:06.785
Where do you think you're going?
Uh, this place called to kill Barry.

17:06.943 --> 17:12.290
Every time y'all fight he beats you like
the redheaded stepchild of a rented mule.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.950
No, he doesn't.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.460
CYRIL: Yeah, both head and ass.
PAM: Pounds you like meat.

17:16.618 --> 17:19.623
<i>Look, look, look. Hang on, hang on.</i>

17:19.789 --> 17:21.962
<i>There we go.
Look, check this out.</i>

17:22.124 --> 17:23.967
<i>Look. Yeah.</i>

17:24.126 --> 17:25.752
<i>Oh.
You can wear this.</i>

17:25.920 --> 17:27.968
<i>My God.
I know. Right?</i>

17:28.130 --> 17:32.135
<i>Evil Cyborg versus Spacebot. Love it.</i>

17:32.301 --> 17:33.644
This is gonna be--

17:33.803 --> 17:36.977
And I hate this word, Barry,
but this is gonna be epic!

17:37.139 --> 17:38.891
I'll be right--
LANA: He can't get in here.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.356
So the only reason
to go out there is your ego.

17:41.519 --> 17:45.114
Not just my ego, Lana,
Spacebofs ego.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.490
And a giant ass-whipping.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.743
I can take him.
Did you not see those claws?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.949
Please. We just
want to go home.

17:51.112 --> 17:53.035
But Spacebot...

17:53.197 --> 17:56.326
Jesus, think about someone else
for once in your life!

17:56.492 --> 17:58.085
And that's her
saying that.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.666
Exactly.

<i>

<i>ARCHER: Uh, Barry?
Yo. Yeah, let's get it on, brother.</i>

18:05.668 --> 18:09.514
I, uh... I can't get it on.

18:09.672 --> 18:12.300
What? Come on.
Maybe next time, sorry.

18:12.466 --> 18:15.185
<i>Hey, don't do that, don't apologize.</i>
Sorry.

18:15.344 --> 18:19.224
I mean, if you're having
a legitimate problem with your vagina...

18:19.390 --> 18:22.143
...that you have between your legs
in lieu of a penis...

18:22.310 --> 18:25.109
<i>...I completely understand.
And you need to deal with that.</i>

18:25.271 --> 18:26.773
<i>Honestly, we can do this another time.</i>

18:29.150 --> 18:30.276
Archer?

18:32.862 --> 18:34.614
Next time, Barry.

18:34.780 --> 18:38.375
Sterling, I know I may not say this very often--
Or ever.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.536
Well, congratulations,
you ruined it.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.171
But I'm still very proud of you.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.673

Archer, stop it!
