WEBVTT

01:11.200 --> 01:12.400
Excuse me.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.700
Excuse me. If I may have your
attention, everyone, please.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.500
Thank you. Thank you.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.800
Many people criticized
my husband and me

01:20.800 --> 01:21.900
for wanting to turn prime,

01:21.901 --> 01:25.201
tourist-friendly real estate
into a children's hospital.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.900
But they don't understand.

01:28.100 --> 01:30.800
Those young lives are the future.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.600
Now, the wealthy often find it easier

01:34.000 --> 01:36.100
to part with their money than their time.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.000
Right?

01:37.600 --> 01:39.200
But in doing both,

01:39.900 --> 01:43.600
you have put your Palm Beach counterparts to shame.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.000
And so, a toast!

01:46.600 --> 01:47.600
To you!

01:47.700 --> 01:48.900
Cheers!

02:26.500 --> 02:29.000
Can't say there's a protocol for this one, Horatio.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.300
Going to have to keep our guy chilled until I can post him.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.100
The murder weapon is, uh, melting.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.900
Alexx, I think someone got here first.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.100
Take a look at that.

02:45.000 --> 02:45.500
Whoa.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.200
A gunshot wound.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.300
Right. Some of the guests heard it.

02:49.700 --> 02:53.000
Shot in the light of day in
a house filled with people?

02:53.600 --> 02:55.100
That's cold-blooded, Horatio.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.300
It's as cold as ice.

03:34.783 --> 03:37.532
CSI: Miami Season 5 Episode 18

04:01.933 --> 04:02.533
Open

04:04.300 --> 04:05.300
Open

04:20.500 --> 04:21.300
Officer?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.900
You seem to be the one in charge here.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.800
I guess that depends who you ask.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.700
My name's Josh Brockner.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.000
I'm Mr. Whitford's...

04:29.600 --> 04:32.100
uh... was Mr. Whitford's executive assistant.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.500
If I can be of any help

04:34.500 --> 04:36.400
Who do you think would want
to kill him, Josh?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.500
Well, he was a real
estate developer...

04:40.600 --> 04:42.800
one of the richest and most
influential in Miami.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.400
Swam with sharks on a daily basis.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.500
For every friend, he had three enemies.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.900
Okay, I need a list of
all of those people.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.200
Sure, anything.

04:51.300 --> 04:52.400
I just want to help get

04:52.500 --> 04:53.800
Mrs. Whitford home to her baby.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.400
She's really been through a lot.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.100
And you will, as soon
as you're done here.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.700
Back in line, please.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.000
Hey.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.200
Is this where the victim was shot?

05:43.300 --> 05:44.000
Yeah.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.600
Right there.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.400
Then he fell backwards,
over the balcony.

05:57.300 --> 05:58.600
Killer made it easier for us.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.700
He left the gun behind.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.200
.38 with a two-inch barrel.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.000
I'll get it to Firearms.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.700
Wait a minute, Eric.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.100
This is another blood drop.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.800
Separate from the rest.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.100
And it's still wet, so it
could be from our killer.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.600
I'll have Valera run it, ASAP.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.700
It's okay, you know.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.700
What is?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.900
To experience a relearning curve.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.800
What are you talking about?

06:37.300 --> 06:39.100
Evidence markers three and four.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.400
You put two markers on the
same blood drop, man.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.800
I can't make a simple mistake?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.500
That's what I kept telling
myself last year.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.700
After I got shot.

06:53.300 --> 06:54.600
I'm fine, Wolfe.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.500
And I'd be even better if everyone would stop

06:56.600 --> 06:58.000
giving me the third degree.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.300
I said that, too.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.200
Hey, Alexx, were you able to recover

07:07.300 --> 07:09.200
the projectile from the victim yet?

07:09.300 --> 07:11.400
Yeah. Sing GSW.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.100
Round penetrated the chest.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.100
Came to rest in the pericardial sack,

07:15.300 --> 07:17.300
which caused massive internal bleeding.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.700
But Whitford's days were already numbered.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.000
There was massive scar tissue on the muscle,

07:22.000 --> 07:23.200
which caused several of the vessels

07:23.300 --> 07:25.500
to become narrow or completely occluded.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.400
Wow. Not even 40 years old

07:27.500 --> 07:28.800
and he's already had a heart attack.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.000
Doesn't mean he didn't do some hard living.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.700
He's got a perforated stum in the nasal cavity.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.100
Ah.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.600
Chronic cocaine use.

07:36.700 --> 07:39.000
Mm-hmm. His heart would've given out soon enough.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.600
The killer just beat him to it.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.200
Which brings us back to the bullet.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.200
Looks like a .38.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.000
It'the same caliber as the weapon Ryan recovered.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.000
It's in nice shape.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.000
Should make my job a lot easier.

07:51.800 --> 07:52.100
Thanks, Alexx.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.300
I'll see you later.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.200
Eric said the .38 came back with no viable prints.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.500
Unfortunately, no.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.800
I was however able to match

08:49.900 --> 08:52.100
the spent round to the recovered firearm,

08:52.200 --> 08:53.800
making it a definite as our murder weapon.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.200
And the serial number wasn't altered.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.000
So Automated Firearms is searching

08:58.100 --> 08:58.800
for a registered owner.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.300
There you go.

09:06.800 --> 09:07.900
Neil Massey.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.600
The trust fund playboy, who's always in Ocean Drive.

09:10.900 --> 09:11.900
That's the guy.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.600
I wonder what Neil has to say for himself.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.100
Mr. Massey, we recovered your firearm from a murder scene.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.000
My .38?

09:29.400 --> 09:32.000
That thing was stolen, few years ago.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.000
Is that a fact?

09:35.900 --> 09:37.400
It's hard to find good help.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.700
People think just because I got money

09:40.800 --> 09:42.700
that I don't notice when things disappear.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.300
So I shouldn't expect to uncover a police report along the way.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.200
Nah.

09:47.300 --> 09:48.400
I got better things to do

09:48.500 --> 09:50.600
than to get someone into a beef with INS.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.200
I understand. Where were you this morning?

09:54.600 --> 09:56.400
At my family's attorney's office,

09:56.500 --> 09:58.600
getting my monthly allowance.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.600
My parents get some kind of a thrill out of

10:04.700 --> 10:06.900
tightening the reins.

10:08.100 --> 10:08.900
Well, we hare a common interest.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.500
I'm going to keep you in a holding cell

10:10.600 --> 10:13.700
till I can verify your story, okay?

10:28.500 --> 10:30.000
Here's another blood drop.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.300
Separate from the rest.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.700
It could be from our killer.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.200
I'll have Valera run it, ASAP.

10:47.900 --> 10:48.600
Valera.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.200
I hope you got something on that blood.

10:50.300 --> 10:52.900
Neil Massey's story checked out, and we had to spring him.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.600
Well, I can see why.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.100
That lone blood drop you found, it came back XX.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.300
Female?

10:58.500 --> 11:00.300
- Yep.
- So whose blood is it?

11:00.400 --> 11:01.900
Did you check it against the reference samples?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.700
Everyone who attended the party.

11:03.800 --> 11:04.800
And guess what?

11:05.100 --> 11:07.300
The blood's consistent with Ashley Whitford.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.300
The victim's wife?

11:09.500 --> 11:10.500
Uh-huh.

11:11.700 --> 11:12.500
All right, thanks.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.800
I got a nose bleed,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
about five minutes before my speech.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.200
Public speaking makes me nervous.

11:23.000 --> 11:23.900
So you admit though

11:24.000 --> 11:24.900
that you were in the bathroom.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.100
Yes, I was.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.700
But I was alone.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.500
My husband hadn't arrived yet.

11:29.700 --> 11:32.200
So you and your husband, you put on this event together--

11:33.000 --> 11:35.800
when you gave your speech, he's not there with you?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.600
We usually arrive separately.

11:39.100 --> 11:40.400
He hates these events.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.400
Always just shows up at the end.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.000
I swear I didn't see him until...

11:46.100 --> 11:47.600
Ashley, let's just-- let's be honest, okay?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.000
This doesn't look good.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.800
You stood to gain everything from your husband's death.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.100
We're talking a huge estate.

11:55.300 --> 11:55.800
Right.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.600
Because everything in this world's about money.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.900
I lost a husband today.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.600
And my baby just lost his father.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.700
I did not kill Dominic.

12:18.700 --> 12:19.600
OK.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.300
Thanks, Ms. Whitford.

12:22.700 --> 12:23.800
We'll be in touch.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.300
What do you think?

12:31.900 --> 12:33.000
I don't buy it.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.800
Well, the evidence is equivocal.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.200
The blood drop she left behind was gravitational.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.100
That's consistent with a nosebleed.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.100
And her alibi's about as airtight as you can get.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.800
Because she was downstairs when he fell.

12:55.000 --> 12:55.900
She forgot her glasses.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.200
I'll catch up to her.

13:01.700 --> 13:02.300
Hey.

13:02.700 --> 13:03.500
Ashley.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.400
Hey, your glasses.

14:20.900 --> 14:21.900
What have we got?

14:22.100 --> 14:24.000
When I chased Ashley outside of MDPD,

14:24.000 --> 14:25.200
I got worried I was seeing things,

14:25.300 --> 14:28.400
so I... compared the fingerprints off her sunglasses

14:28.400 --> 14:30.400
the sample print we took at the party.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.400
They don't match.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.100
The Ashley Whitford we interviewed-- it's not her.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.800
Eric, I think it's likely that

14:40.900 --> 14:43.000
Ashley Whitford has an identical twin.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.100
And she played us.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.100
They played us.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.500
They're playing everyone.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.400
Would you like your sunglasses back?

15:07.200 --> 15:08.300
Miss...?

15:08.400 --> 15:10.200
Cayla Selby.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.600
She's my sister.

15:11.900 --> 15:12.500
Yeah.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.600
Boy, you guys really tried to pull a face one.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.700
Which one of you murdered Dominic Whitford?

15:18.800 --> 15:20.100
Neither.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.000
Just because we're twins doesn't make us murderers.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.000
It doesn't make you innocent either, Cayla.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.300
You just posed as your sister.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.200
That means you're looking at obstruction of justice

15:30.300 --> 15:31.700
and giving false information.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.300
But everything Cayla said was true.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.600
I told her exactly what to say to you guys.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.100
It may as we have been me.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.800
So do you remember what to say?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.000
Don't worry, Ashley.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.900
I've always been great being you.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.300
I'll call you when I'm done?

15:44.400 --> 15:45.100
Wait.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.100
My ring.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.400
But it wasn't you, Ashley.

15:55.300 --> 15:58.100
Were you afraid that you couldn't pull off the lies?

15:58.600 --> 16:00.800
I just wanted to be with my son.

16:01.800 --> 16:02.700
He's only a year old.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.500
He doesn't get that his daddy is never coming home.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.100
Ashley could barely speak to anyone, let alone cops.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.400
We've always covered for each other.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.100
You know, like tests in school,

16:14.300 --> 16:15.500
creepy dates.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.500
And Dominic knew you were twins?

16:19.300 --> 16:20.400
No.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.600
He didn't need to know.

16:22.900 --> 16:23.800
Interesting.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.800
Makes it easier to cover up murder.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.200
Ashley did not kill Dominic.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.200
Here's the thing.

16:30.300 --> 16:31.900
You have different fingerprints, but...

16:32.100 --> 16:34.500
identical twins share the same DNA,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.200
so the blood that we found at the crime scene

16:37.400 --> 16:38.800
puts you there as well.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.600
I told you guys already.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.100
It's mine.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.600
My nose started bleeding.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.500
No, actually, Cayla told us that, which means

16:45.500 --> 16:47.700
that I don't know really who is covering for who.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.600
Okay, Ashley was outside at the time,

16:51.700 --> 16:53.700
and I wasn't even at the party, okay?

16:54.500 --> 16:55.600
I was at the gym.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.100
Feel free to check.

16:58.800 --> 16:59.900
- I will.
- Okay.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.200
I will. In fact, I'll double check.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.000
Hey, I got your message.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.500
There's new information?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.200
I checked Dominic Whitford's medical records.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.500
In 39 years, he's only checked into the hospital twice.

17:18.599 --> 17:20.700
He jammed a Q-tip in his ear when he was 11

17:20.800 --> 17:23.400
and was treated for a case of pleurisy at 27.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.500
Otherwise, perfect health.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.000
There's nothing anywhere about a myocardial infarction.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.100
Well, if he didn't have a heart attack,

17:32.200 --> 17:34.500
then what caused the s tissue on his heart muscle?

17:35.100 --> 17:36.100
A heart attack.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.800
The twins thought they had a secret.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.700
Whitford had an even bigger secret.

17:40.800 --> 17:41.600
Wait a minute.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.700
Are you saying that this is not Dominic Whitford?

17:43.900 --> 17:45.200
Are you saying this is another twin?

17:45.300 --> 17:49.100
No, but he tried really hard to be him.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.400
I don't know what you mean.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.400
See this scar along the hairline?

17:54.700 --> 17:57.000
Well, this is where plastic surgeons like to hide

17:57.100 --> 17:58.300
their handiwork.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.200
He had a face lift.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.000
Correct.

18:01.100 --> 18:02.800
But not to lose a few wrinkles.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.100
He changed his whole appearance.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.100
Scars inside the mouth.

18:07.700 --> 18:10.400
That indicates cheek implants and chin augmentation.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.300
There's another scar right here.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.200
A bilateral otoplasty.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.000
Had both ears pinned back,

18:16.001 --> 18:19.301
capped it off with a nose job and color contact lenses.

18:34.900 --> 18:37.000
We're not talking a reasonable facsimile, honey.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.500
This man paid big money.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.900
Maybe Dominic Whitford picked up the tab.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.100
You think he was paid to be Dominic's look-alike?

18:47.400 --> 18:47.800
I don't know.

18:47.900 --> 18:50.300
He's a hotshot real estate developer,

18:50.700 --> 18:52.500
needs to be in two places at once.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.200
And he had a lot of enemies.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.200
I mean, someone thought they had killed him.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.400
You know, if that's true,

18:58.500 --> 19:00.200
Dominic Whitford is still alive.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.600
MrWhitford has had at least three attempts on his life.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.500
Development displaces people and people get angry.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.300
You should see the hate mail.

19:08.700 --> 19:10.400
So you knew he had a look-alike.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.800
Knew? I... I helped hire the guy.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.300
Greg Ramsey.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.300
He gave up his identity for 100K a year.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.000
He also gave up his life.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.600
So you knew the victim wasn't Whitford,

19:26.900 --> 19:28.900
and you knew that we were investigating the murder

19:29.000 --> 19:30.800
of a look-alike, and yet you said nothing.

19:30.900 --> 19:31.600
Why?

19:31.700 --> 19:32.700
I couldn't.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.100
When Greg nt down...

19:35.800 --> 19:38.200
I-I thought my boss could be in danger.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.900
H-He went to great lengths to create this decoy.

19:41.000 --> 19:41.500
I'm the only one who knows.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.200
Even his wife doesn't know.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.700
Well, if your boss is in danger, we need to find him.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.300
Do you have any idea where he is?

19:48.400 --> 19:49.100
I don't know.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.200
I haven't been able to reach him all day.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.700
Okay, let me put it to you this way.

19:58.300 --> 20:02.300
Whitford, like yourself, could be a suspect,

20:02.400 --> 20:04.700
so I suggest that you start cooperating with me,

20:04.800 --> 20:05.700
all right?

20:09.600 --> 20:11.000
He's been spending a lot of time

20:11.100 --> 20:12.000
at the Ambrose Estates property.

20:12.100 --> 20:13.700
They just broke ground.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.100
That wasn't so bad, was it?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.200
Thanks, leave right now.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.900
The dead shall rise.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.800
You seem to be in a hurry, Mr. Whitford.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.600
Uh, no, I didn't realize you guys were cops.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.300
I... I heard about the shooting.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.600
Figured I might be next.

21:16.450 --> 21:17.550
Mr. Whitford, I'll be frank.

21:17.650 --> 21:20.150
Either you killed Greg Ramsey or you know who did.

21:21.050 --> 21:24.350
My look-alike does promotional events for me all the time.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.950
Given, this is obviously

21:27.050 --> 21:30.950
the worst-case scenario, but... he knew the risks.

21:31.050 --> 21:32.250
What do you mean risks?

21:32.950 --> 21:34.850
When you're as high profile as I am,

21:34.950 --> 21:37.950
sometimes even leaving the house is dangerous.

21:38.150 --> 21:41.350
I'm a very recognizable person in Miami.

21:43.050 --> 21:46.350
I just used my double for added security, plain and simple.

21:49.350 --> 21:49.850
Go.

21:50.450 --> 21:51.800
Maybe you were attempting to fake your own death

21:51.550 --> 21:52.850
to disappear,

21:53.250 --> 21:55.250
and your double became expendable.

21:56.350 --> 21:56.950
No.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.450
I had nothing to do with Greg Ramsey's death.

22:06.650 --> 22:07.650
Excuse me.

22:25.950 --> 22:27.050
Mr. Wolfe.

22:28.450 --> 22:30.250
The cadaver dogs, please.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.250
H.

23:05.950 --> 23:08.250
I had no idea anyone was buried here.

23:08.350 --> 23:10.050
Well, you know, this isn't the first dead body

23:10.200 --> 23:12.000
you've been associated with today.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.300
I don't understand.

23:14.100 --> 23:15.200
I really don't.

23:16.900 --> 23:18.600
I mean, I swear I'm innocent.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.100
Then you'll be okay with protective custody

23:20.200 --> 23:21.400
till we prove it.

23:23.150 --> 23:25.550
Mr. Whitford, have you called your wife

23:25.750 --> 23:27.350
and told her that you're still alive?

23:27.450 --> 23:29.650
No, I figured it was safer her not knowing.

23:29.750 --> 23:30.950
You know, until I got to the bottom of it.

23:31.050 --> 23:33.350
Well, then you're both in for a big surprise.

23:46.710 --> 23:48.010
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:49.110 --> 23:51.410
That's the girl from the construction site.

23:51.610 --> 23:54.210
Yeah, I did my best to put the poor baby back together.

23:54.410 --> 23:55.610
Almost done fluoroscoping.

23:55.710 --> 23:56.910
Were you able to get an ID?

23:57.210 --> 24:00.010
Dental records match on a missing person.

24:00.110 --> 24:01.310
Mia Graham.

24:01.810 --> 24:03.910
Mia Graham? That name sounds so familiar.

24:06.810 --> 24:09.110
I think this girl used to work for Dominic Whitford.

24:09.210 --> 24:11.110
I came across her name in one of his files.

24:11.210 --> 24:13.010
COD's pressed skull fracture.

24:14.310 --> 24:16.310
Any thoughts on what the murder weapon might be?

24:16.410 --> 24:18.010
I think you might have more luck identifying

24:18.110 --> 24:19.410
what cut her up.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.360
I guess saw marks are easier to identify

24:22.460 --> 24:23.760
than depression marks.

24:24.360 --> 24:25.460
Wait a minute.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.960
I think I just found a piece of it.

24:39.860 --> 24:42.760
Has teeth. Looks like a saw blade.

24:42.860 --> 24:44.560
It could be from a, uh...

24:46.260 --> 24:47.360
Sawzall?

24:49.460 --> 24:50.760
Think you can get a print?

24:50.860 --> 24:51.860
I know I can.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.960
Your boss said you'd be here, Josh.

25:18.660 --> 25:19.960
And I guess he was right.

25:20.760 --> 25:23.260
I, uh, you know, I was just... cleaning up.

25:24.260 --> 25:26.160
Yes, I can imagine you are.

25:26.860 --> 25:28.660
Well, I run this job site so...

25:28.860 --> 25:30.760
anything goes missing, I take the hit.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.860
I would get used to that if I were you.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.060
We found your fingerprint on the blade

25:38.160 --> 25:39.660
that killed Mia Graham,

25:39.960 --> 25:41.660
your former supervisor.

25:43.660 --> 25:45.160
It's a perfect match.

25:46.460 --> 25:47.660
Why would I kill her?

25:49.360 --> 25:50.660
You killed Mia

25:51.160 --> 25:53.360
because she was Mr. Whitford's assistant

25:53.460 --> 25:55.060
and you wanted her job

25:55.360 --> 25:57.760
A job would have been out of your reach.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.560
Someday all this will be yours.

26:01.660 --> 26:03.560
Really? You think Mr. Whitford will let me

26:03.660 --> 26:05.160
manage the site? No.

26:05.260 --> 26:06.760
You'll be running the machinery.

26:06.860 --> 26:08.160
I've told Dominic that that's

26:08.260 --> 26:09.860
on a par with your skill level.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.460
Except for the heavy stuff.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.360
Never figured anyone would find her.

26:40.760 --> 26:43.260
And that's because killers like you, Josh,

26:43.960 --> 26:45.160
never do

26:46.360 --> 26:47.160
Take him.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.260
We're not going to tell Ashley her husband's still alive?

27:00.360 --> 27:01.560
That seems kind of cruel.

27:02.260 --> 27:05.560
Hey, they don't want to be straight with us, we return the favor.

27:05.660 --> 27:07.560
Besides, H. doesn't want anyone in on this

27:07.660 --> 27:08.860
until we know who we can trust.

27:10.360 --> 27:10.760
All right.

27:11.860 --> 27:14.560
I have a police report from the first attempt

27:14.660 --> 27:15.960
on Dominic Whitford's life.

27:16.560 --> 27:19.060
You think it was the same person tried again today?

27:19.660 --> 27:20.860
If at first you don't succeed...

27:22.160 --> 27:23.960
Says here Mr. and Mrs. Whitford were shot at

27:24.060 --> 27:26.160
outside the country club polo grounds.

27:26.660 --> 27:28.360
Ashley was eight months pregnant.

27:29.060 --> 27:30.060
Bullet missed them both,

27:30.160 --> 27:31.060
but Ashley fell.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.660
She was rushed to the hospital for an emergency C-section.

27:34.460 --> 27:35.960
Looks like the only piece of ballistic evidence

27:36.060 --> 27:37.760
we got was this 9mm round.

27:39.560 --> 27:40.660
Couldn't tie it back to a gun.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.460
Tell you what we do have,

27:42.560 --> 27:44.260
we have a list of witnesses and suspects.

27:44.460 --> 27:45.560
Anyone of interest?

27:46.360 --> 27:47.060
Yeah.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.260
Take a look at this.

27:51.660 --> 27:52.760
Neil Massey.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.260
Same guy that owns the gun

27:54.360 --> 27:55.860
involved in the shooting this morning.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.960
Now he's connected to two attempts on Whitford's life.

28:06.360 --> 28:07.860
So I'm thinking that shooting

28:07.960 --> 28:10.760
at Dominic Whitford was target practice?

28:10.860 --> 28:12.560
- Mr. Massey?
- I assume you're talking

28:12.660 --> 28:14.560
about the incident at the country club.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.260
I am talking about the incident at the country club.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.260
I was at the clubhouse when it happened.

28:19.660 --> 28:22.460
A cop questioned me as a witness not a suspect.

28:22.660 --> 28:25.460
It was a year ago and they agree it was a coincidence.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.260
Why didn't you mention it before?

28:28.260 --> 28:29.760
Because I knew it would look bad.

28:30.060 --> 28:31.760
But believe me, it was...

28:31.860 --> 28:32.860
just a coincidence.

28:34.660 --> 28:36.660
Seeing as Dominic Whitford is dead,

28:36.760 --> 28:38.260
I don't believe there are any coincidences,

28:38.360 --> 28:40.160
and I think a jury will agree with me.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.160
Let's book him.

28:41.460 --> 28:41.760
Get him out.

28:42.960 --> 28:43.660
Wait a minute.

28:44.560 --> 28:45.460
Wait a minute...

28:49.360 --> 28:52.260
I... I did shoot at the Whitfords last year.

28:53.060 --> 28:55.060
But it had nothing to do with Dominic.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.160
I was aiming at his wife.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.360
His wife?

29:13.060 --> 29:14.460
Why Whitford's wife?

29:14.760 --> 29:16.160
We dated three years ago.

29:16.460 --> 29:17.760
I kept a lot of cash in the house

29:17.860 --> 29:19.360
and one day it was gone.

29:19.560 --> 29:20.860
Along with my .38.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.360
Now Ashley was with me when it happened,

29:23.460 --> 29:25.760
so I thought it couldn't have been her.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.260
But then I found out about her sister.

29:28.860 --> 29:30.060
Why didn't you report it?

29:30.260 --> 29:31.260
No proof.

29:32.060 --> 29:33.460
And to be honest,

29:34.160 --> 29:35.260
I was embarrassed.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.160
You know, duped by twins.

29:38.260 --> 29:39.260
Like a joke.

29:39.460 --> 29:41.160
I felt like I was stuck

29:41.260 --> 29:42.760
in one of them gum commercials.

29:44.060 --> 29:44.760
Well...

29:44.960 --> 29:46.260
since you've copped to it,

29:46.360 --> 29:48.660
you're going to be stuck in prison for attempted murder.

29:49.260 --> 29:50.860
I.. I just wanted to scare her.

29:50.960 --> 29:52.560
Look, you're lucky she didn't lose the baby.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.360
If she had, you'd be in there for murder.

29:57.460 --> 29:58.060
Let's go.

30:08.260 --> 30:10.860
Hey, Natalia. It's Calleigh.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.960
Listen, I think we need to pay the twins another visit.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.660
And would you pick up a copy of Ocean Drive on your way in?

30:17.760 --> 30:18.760
Oh, you'll see.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.660
Bye.

30:22.360 --> 30:24.360
What stolen money? Neil's lying.

30:24.560 --> 30:27.260
Oh, I... I'm sure. I can't wait to hear the truth.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.960
He was scary jealous.

30:29.060 --> 30:32.360
He went into a rage when I left him for Dominic.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.760
The guy was practically stalking Ashley.

30:35.060 --> 30:36.160
He couldn't kill Ashley,

30:36.260 --> 30:37.460
so he went after Dominic.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.860
I'm just grateful that Noah's safe.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.060
Yes to him. Uh...

30:43.260 --> 30:44.960
You had a cesarean delivery, right?

30:45.060 --> 30:46.960
I had to. During the shooting, I fell.

30:47.060 --> 30:47.960
There was bleeding.

30:48.060 --> 30:51.460
Well, maybe you can explain this picture

30:51.560 --> 30:53.360
that I found of you in Ocean Drive magazine.

30:56.160 --> 30:57.660
It's really cute to you.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.560
But there's no scar.

31:02.960 --> 31:03.560
Oh...

31:05.460 --> 31:06.860
They must've airbrushed it.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.560
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:11.060 --> 31:12.160
Do you know that I can get a warrant

31:12.260 --> 31:14.160
to have your body searched for surgical scars?

31:21.460 --> 31:22.460
All right.

31:23.660 --> 31:25.360
Ashley found out she couldn't have children.

31:25.760 --> 31:26.960
I had the baby, okay.

31:27.160 --> 31:30.360
So you covered for each other like back in high school,

31:30.760 --> 31:32.460
but this time you slept with him.

31:32.860 --> 31:34.560
I couldn't tell him.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.260
I was afraid that he'd leave me.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.860
Children were so important to him.

31:40.660 --> 31:42.960
Hey... give me a second.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.260
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.160
Any tips?

32:00.460 --> 32:03.460
He likes... enthusiasm.

32:04.460 --> 32:06.260
Blow in his ear, it'll be over before you know it.

32:07.860 --> 32:08.660
Ready?

32:09.560 --> 32:10.660
As'm ever going to be.

32:28.260 --> 32:30.660
You're the most beautiful woman in the world.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.660
So you're telling me that you switched places

32:34.760 --> 32:37.160
for nine whole months without Dominic knowing?

32:37.260 --> 32:39.260
Yes. I know it was wrong.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.760
Yeah, you are wrong, Cayla, because we checked

32:41.860 --> 32:43.460
your passport and you weren't in the country.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.660
You were in Africa the entire pregnancy.

32:48.460 --> 32:49.860
I already called Child Services.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.460
They're going to take Noah away

32:51.760 --> 32:53.160
and send him to foster care

32:54.560 --> 32:57.160
unless you tell me the whole truth right now.

33:00.560 --> 33:01.460
Wait!

33:09.760 --> 33:11.660
Please don't take him.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.360
He's mine. Noah's mine.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.460
Triplets.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.560
That's... well, that's...

33:30.360 --> 33:31.660
perfect.

33:35.360 --> 33:36.960
All three of you are coming with me.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.860
I really shouldn't talk without Ashley and Cayla.

34:00.660 --> 34:02.960
I already spoke to them, I'd like to hear your story.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.560
I don't know how it got this far.

34:07.660 --> 34:09.060
Why don't you tell me how it started?

34:09.659 --> 34:11.460
It was always just a game.

34:12.060 --> 34:13.460
Cheatng on tests.

34:14.460 --> 34:16.560
Fooling bosses, boyfriends.

34:16.760 --> 34:18.760
So you three went after Dominic?

34:18.860 --> 34:20.060
We grew up poor.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.560
This was a way to make sure we were okay forever.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.760
Ashley was supposed to marry him.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.860
Anytime it got old, Cayla and I'd step in.

34:28.260 --> 34:29.560
Then Ashley would divorce him,

34:29.659 --> 34:31.260
and then get a big chunk of change.

34:31.760 --> 34:32.860
But he wanted a pregnant.

34:34.060 --> 34:35.760
Well, then Ashley had to get pregnant

34:36.360 --> 34:38.159
since the money always goes with the kid.

34:38.860 --> 34:42.260
But... she couldn't do it.

34:43.659 --> 34:44.860
Ashley's infertile.

34:45.560 --> 34:46.560
So I did.

34:47.860 --> 34:49.659
Having a baby-- that is not a game.

34:49.860 --> 34:50.560
I know.

34:51.960 --> 34:53.260
I love Noah so much.

34:53.360 --> 34:54.260
I miss him.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.260
Did you kill Dominic so that you could get him back?

34:56.360 --> 34:57.560
No. God, no.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.760
Dom was actually a really good guy.

35:00.860 --> 35:01.660
Who killed him?

35:06.660 --> 35:08.060
We have the blood from the crime scene.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.160
We know it was one of you.

35:21.660 --> 35:22.660
I don't know.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.660
You're going to lose Noah, Beth,

35:27.060 --> 35:28.460
if you don't help me out here.

35:30.260 --> 35:31.260
I'm sorry.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.360
H. , I heard you caught Josh Brockner.

35:49.260 --> 35:50.360
Yes, we did.

35:50.460 --> 35:51.760
What about the triplets?

35:52.260 --> 35:53.160
Dead end.

35:53.260 --> 35:54.760
We know one of them did it,

35:55.060 --> 35:57.060
but we just can't tie it to them individually.

35:57.160 --> 35:59.360
Identical blood and identical DNA.

35:59.860 --> 36:01.860
Just got to figure out which one of them it belongs to.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.260
Antibodies, Eric.

36:04.460 --> 36:05.460
Antibodies.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.660
All the girls were born with the same blood.

36:11.060 --> 36:11.660
What they don't know is

36:11.760 --> 36:14.260
that every time the body experiences a specific trauma,

36:15.060 --> 36:16.460
it builds antibodies to fight it.

36:17.660 --> 36:19.660
So you got different lives, different traumas.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.160
And Beth Selby's blood is going to show presence

36:22.260 --> 36:24.160
of anti-RH positive antibodies,

36:24.260 --> 36:26.360
which a woman's body produces when she's pregnant.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.960
Well, we find that in the blood, she's our killer.

36:29.660 --> 36:32.360
And thus, the antigen antibody test.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.060
I add a specific

36:37.160 --> 36:38.160
reagent to the sample,

36:38.560 --> 36:40.760
give her a quick spin in the centrifuge,

36:41.560 --> 36:43.360
and if it precipitates, then we've got her.

36:55.060 --> 36:55.460
No.

36:56.460 --> 36:57.660
Sorry, Eric. There's no evidence

36:57.760 --> 37:00.160
of any anti-RH positive antibodies.

37:01.860 --> 37:03.460
Eliminates Beth as the killer.

37:03.760 --> 37:04.660
Try this.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.860
This reagent may show us something else

37:07.960 --> 37:08.660
on the next blood sample.

37:09.360 --> 37:12.360
You know that this is the very last blood sample

37:12.460 --> 37:13.560
from the scene.

37:14.060 --> 37:16.060
We test this one, we're out of crime scene samples.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.460
Just call it hunch.

37:19.360 --> 37:20.460
If it doesn't pay off,

37:20.560 --> 37:21.360
we've got nothing.

37:21.460 --> 37:21.960
I know.

37:23.460 --> 37:24.760
A killer could walk.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.260
Okay.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.560
Is it clotting?

37:44.860 --> 37:46.060
Yes, it is.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.660
Indicates the presence

37:48.760 --> 37:50.060
of specific IgG and IgM antibodies.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.260
You know what that shows.

37:51.760 --> 37:52.960
The presence of a killer.

38:03.860 --> 38:05.460
You know, as a CSI,

38:05.660 --> 38:08.360
I spend a lot of time looking at things

38:08.460 --> 38:11.860
that to the naked eye seem identical, but aren't.

38:15.860 --> 38:17.360
Likes prints and

38:17.460 --> 38:19.160
DNA, tool marks.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.560
It's just what I do... really well.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.460
- So?
- So,

38:24.860 --> 38:27.760
triplets... are no problem.

38:30.060 --> 38:32.260
I have to say, though, you girls were really good.

38:32.460 --> 38:33.060
I mean, Ashley,

38:33.160 --> 38:34.760
you lured Dominic in like a pro.

38:34.860 --> 38:37.860
You used your MBA background
to spark aittle interest.

38:38.060 --> 38:40.160
Maybe there was even love. Who knows?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.860
Then, Beth, you stepped in

38:41.960 --> 38:43.460
and did the one thing
that Ashley couldn't

38:44.460 --> 38:45.560
and had a child.

38:46.060 --> 38:47.060
But I didn't kill anybody.

38:47.160 --> 38:47.960
I told you that.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.260
Oh, and you know what, Beth?
I believe you.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.160
I think that's the one thing
you couldn't do.

38:52.260 --> 38:53.960
The blood from the crime
scene showed the presence

38:54.060 --> 38:55.660
of IgG and IgM.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.560
Meaning?

38:57.060 --> 38:58.560
Meaning that person was immunized

38:58.660 --> 39:00.060
against an infectious disease.

39:00.560 --> 39:01.460
Dengue fever,

39:01.560 --> 39:03.660
to be exact, which is
contracted in Africa.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.560
And, Cayla...

39:08.160 --> 39:09.360
only you have been there.

39:15.660 --> 39:17.060
I was told to shoot Dominic

39:17.160 --> 39:18.760
when I heard the champagne corks pop.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.160
While Beth was at the gym.

39:24.060 --> 39:26.560
Which provided you with a
really nice little alibi.

39:38.160 --> 39:40.360
Exse me. If I may have your
attention, please?

39:41.360 --> 39:42.560
It wasn't glamorous enough,

39:42.660 --> 39:44.660
didn't generate enough
tax revenue to ensure

39:44.760 --> 39:46.460
the city a rich future.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.860
But they don't understand.

39:50.060 --> 39:52.860
Those young lives are the future.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.960
The wealthy often find it easier

40:01.260 --> 40:03.560
to part with their money
than their time.

40:03.860 --> 40:04.560
...counterparts to shame.

40:05.060 --> 40:06.760
So, a toast

40:07.460 --> 40:08.360
to you!

40:11.360 --> 40:13.160
Ashley, I thought
you were downstairs.

40:30.660 --> 40:31.660
Damn it, Cayla.

40:31.760 --> 40:34.760
We both said that trip
was a stupid idea.

40:34.860 --> 40:35.860
It wasn't a trip.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.160
I was a student.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.560
Then you got one of your little
nosebleeds, didn't you?

40:39.960 --> 40:40.560
So?

40:40.660 --> 40:42.560
So, we did all the work,
and you messed up.

40:42.660 --> 40:45.360
Are you kidding me, Bethie?
You lay there.

40:45.760 --> 40:47.160
He told me how disinterested

40:47.260 --> 40:50.060
I seemed all those months
before I got pregnant.

40:50.160 --> 40:53.160
Okay, okay, okay, ladies,
if it's of any comfort,

40:53.760 --> 40:55.160
you're all guilty of murder.

40:57.460 --> 40:58.960
What's going to happen to my baby?

41:00.960 --> 41:02.460
He'll be raised by his father.

41:03.760 --> 41:04.860
Excuse me?

41:05.560 --> 41:06.560
His father?

41:07.360 --> 41:08.360
He's dead.

41:09.060 --> 41:10.360
How is that possible?

41:15.360 --> 41:17.860
Because I can spot differences,

41:19.160 --> 41:20.460
and you three can't.

42:35.060 --> 42:36.860
When you've got money, everyby
wants a piece of you.

42:38.560 --> 42:41.460
I spent so much time suspecting
the people I work with,

42:43.760 --> 42:44.860
I never thought
to look next to me.

42:45.860 --> 42:47.660
My whole life people
have told me lies.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.160
You know, despite all
that's happened,

42:50.260 --> 42:51.860
I still have the only thing
that's important...

42:53.160 --> 42:54.160
my son.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.560
Well, he's a lucky kid.

43:00.060 --> 43:01.060
And why is that?

43:02.060 --> 43:05.160
Because his father is a good man.
