00:45.915 --> 00:47.632
Excuse me!

00:47.656 --> 00:48.981
Special request from the bride.

00:49.005 --> 00:50.461
Would you mind
bringing it to her?

00:50.485 --> 00:52.443
I have to assist
an elderly guest.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.491
Ellen...

01:20.515 --> 01:23.189
Sorry, I thought you
were my sister.

01:23.213 --> 01:26.651
Thanks, this is exactly
what I needed.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.289
I m going to beat all of you!

01:36.313 --> 01:37.377
Wait, what are we doing though?

01:37.401 --> 01:38.161
Animal names.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.771
What?

01:39.795 --> 01:41.642
Next animal has to begin with the
last letter of the previous.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.818
But no repeats or you are out!

01:43.842 --> 01:44.906
Oh okay.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.212
Octopus!

01:46.236 --> 01:47.866
Sheep!

01:47.890 --> 01:49.172
Umm, P...

01:49.196 --> 01:50.738
Polar Bear!

01:50.762 --> 01:52.871
Rat!

01:52.895 --> 01:55.439
Tarantula!

01:55.463 --> 01:57.441
Aadvark!

01:57.465 --> 01:58.790
Harper, you re up.

01:58.814 --> 02:01.227
Animal that starts with a K.
Can she do it?

02:01.251 --> 02:02.098
Kangaroo!

02:02.122 --> 02:03.011
Yeah!

02:03.035 --> 02:03.795
Octopus!

02:03.819 --> 02:04.970
I already said Octopus.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.102
You did?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.277
She did, she s right.

02:07.301 --> 02:08.495
Boom! Got you dad!

02:08.519 --> 02:10.149
Oh, I see how it s going to be.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.107
You re going to gang up on me?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.151
Yeah!

02:12.175 --> 02:12.934
Girl power!

02:12.958 --> 02:14.284
That s right!

02:14.308 --> 02:15.308
100 percent.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.988
Wow, I love this.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.511
You made this?

02:24.535 --> 02:27.819
Everything you see
was made by me.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.299
Wow, you do beautiful work.

02:29.323 --> 02:30.324
Thank you.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.390
Dad!

02:33.414 --> 02:35.609
Can you buy me this
necklace, please?

02:35.633 --> 02:37.872
It s so awesome and beautiful!

02:37.896 --> 02:39.396
She has great taste.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.093
Yeah, great expensive taste.

02:41.117 --> 02:42.573
Maybe for your birthday, kiddo.

02:42.597 --> 02:44.270
But that s eight months
away, c mon, Dad!

02:44.294 --> 02:46.142
Harper...

02:46.166 --> 02:47.665
Okay.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.493
Hey Tee?

02:49.517 --> 02:51.059
What do you think about
the sandwich shop

02:51.083 --> 02:52.148
across the street for lunch?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.453
Sounds great.

02:53.477 --> 02:55.277
I ll meet you there, I m
going to look around.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.893
Your daughter is so adorable.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.679
Oh, well we re just dating.

03:01.703 --> 03:05.663
But you re right, she s the
most adorable thing ever.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.233
She loves this necklace...

03:12.279 --> 03:13.647
You can have the rest, Tina.

03:13.671 --> 03:14.866
I saw you eyeing it.

03:14.890 --> 03:15.780
Thank you.

03:15.804 --> 03:18.261
Here, how about I trade you?

03:18.285 --> 03:19.547
What is that?

03:23.420 --> 03:24.963
You got me the necklace?

03:24.987 --> 03:26.094
It s a back to school present.

03:26.118 --> 03:28.271
Another one?

03:28.295 --> 03:29.948
I can t help spoiling her.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.539
Let s see.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.280
I really love it!

03:37.304 --> 03:38.609
Thanks Tina.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.133
Thank you, Tina.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.417
So what do you want to do now?

03:44.441 --> 03:45.418
More shopping.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.617
More shopping?

03:52.710 --> 03:55.298
Brock asked me to
move in with him.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.648
You re kidding! Already?

03:57.672 --> 04:00.955
C mon, you guys have been
dating what, six months?

04:00.979 --> 04:02.435
That is fast even by
normal standards.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.045
Normal standards?

04:04.069 --> 04:05.873
You know what I mean.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.702
You re his first relationship
since his wife passed.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.791
Well, he s my first
relationship since Chad

04:10.815 --> 04:12.271
called off the engagement.

04:12.295 --> 04:15.318
So technically, we re
both on the rebound.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.494
Look, I just don t
want you to get hurt.

04:17.517 --> 04:21.019
Don t worry, I read all the
Girlfriend of Widower blogs.

04:21.043 --> 04:22.412
They have blogs for that?

04:22.436 --> 04:24.065
Yeah, hey have a
blog for everything.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.806
They even have a checklist
on how you know

04:25.830 --> 04:27.721
whether or not he s moved on.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.810
He barely mentions Lorna
and he hasn t posted

04:29.834 --> 04:32.813
on her memorial page
since we got serious.

04:32.837 --> 04:35.903
Okay, you check and regularly.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.949
Yeah, I m not an idiot.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.820
Anyway, you ll be happy
to know I said no,

04:39.844 --> 04:42.345
I m not moving in
until we re ready

04:42.369 --> 04:44.782
to make a more
serious commitment.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.218
Aww, my little sis...

04:46.242 --> 04:47.242
all grown up!

04:52.422 --> 04:55.140
So Simon is in hedge funds...

04:55.164 --> 04:56.141
No, that s Greg.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.709
Simon is in tech.

04:58.733 --> 05:02.626
Okay, but Simon s wife,
Petra, is a podiatrist?

05:02.650 --> 05:06.238
That s close, she
s a pediatrician.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.457
Relax.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.894
It s a party, it s not
a standardized test.

05:09.918 --> 05:12.157
Everyone s going to love you.

05:12.181 --> 05:14.768
Oh, by the way, Joyce and
her boyfriend Duane,

05:14.792 --> 05:16.509
they re at the house.

05:16.533 --> 05:17.902
Your ex mother-in-law?

05:17.926 --> 05:19.164
I thought they were in Europe?

05:19.188 --> 05:20.818
Yeah, I had the dates
all screwed up.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.646
I thought they were
coming back next week.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.952
They stopped by on their
way home from the airport.

05:24.976 --> 05:27.588
Of course, I m excited
to meet her, finally.

05:31.418 --> 05:34.048
I find it completely puzzling.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.789
He plans this big party...

05:35.813 --> 05:37.443
Oh, I don t know how
big it is, Joyce...

05:37.467 --> 05:38.575
Yeah?

05:38.599 --> 05:41.142
Did you see the size
of the platters?

05:41.166 --> 05:43.144
Lorna always included
us in everything.

05:43.168 --> 05:47.366
So maybe he wants to introduce
Tina to his friends first.

05:47.390 --> 05:50.891
Probably just a dry run
before she meets you.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.806
Do you have my heart meds?

05:52.830 --> 05:54.571
Uh, yeah.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.813
- Here.
- Thank you.

05:59.837 --> 06:03.904
We re gone two months and
she s practically moved in.

06:03.928 --> 06:06.429
Joyce, we ve been traveling
ten hours straight.

06:06.453 --> 06:10.041
What I need now is a hot
shower and my own bed.

06:10.065 --> 06:13.566
I told him we were
staying, we have to stay.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.046
Nona! Where are you?

06:15.070 --> 06:16.090
In your Dad s bedroom, Sweets!

06:16.114 --> 06:17.788
Just freshening up!

06:17.812 --> 06:19.485
Look at you!

06:19.509 --> 06:22.575
How gorgeous and
grown up you are.

06:22.599 --> 06:23.924
Is it my imagination,

06:23.948 --> 06:26.187
or have you grown a
foot since I was gone?

06:26.211 --> 06:28.494
I m going to be taller
than you soon, you know.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.496
Don t get too big
for your britches.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.150
Oh, I love your necklace.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.065
Tina bought it for me!

06:34.089 --> 06:35.458
Dad didn t want to get it.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.242
He said it was way
too expensive.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.330
Well, it s lovely.

06:38.354 --> 06:39.940
Do you have your
school list ready?

06:39.964 --> 06:42.073
Because you know how much I love
taking you school shopping.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.770
I already have everything.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.555
Wow, your Dad finally
got organized?

06:45.579 --> 06:47.078
I find that hard to believe.

06:47.102 --> 06:49.036
No, Tina took me.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.148
Oh...

06:52.803 --> 06:54.370
Yay, they re here!

07:00.376 --> 07:02.485
Nona, this is Tina!

07:02.509 --> 07:04.095
Hi, so nice to meet you.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.662
Lovely to meet you too.

07:05.686 --> 07:06.793
This is Duane.

07:06.817 --> 07:07.533
Hi there.

07:07.557 --> 07:08.534
Hi, Tina.

07:08.558 --> 07:10.275
Welcome back.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.364
I ve got ice cream melting,
so I gotta go to the kitchen.

07:12.388 --> 07:14.912
Harper, will you join me?

07:20.396 --> 07:22.156
So...

07:22.180 --> 07:24.507
Brock tells me that
you are a lawyer.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.160
Is that what you were
doing in Europe?

07:26.184 --> 07:28.075
No, we were sight seeing.

07:28.099 --> 07:30.469
I like to get out of the
office as often as I can.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.166
Doctor s orders.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.038
Duane has a heart condition.

07:34.062 --> 07:36.519
Stress isn t good for him,

07:36.543 --> 07:40.871
but he loves his law practice.

07:40.895 --> 07:44.048
Just like Lorna.

07:44.072 --> 07:48.400
She was the youngest lawyer
to be partner at the firm.

07:48.424 --> 07:49.401
Very impressive.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.924
Yeah.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.492
Is that how you two met?

07:53.516 --> 07:55.538
Lorna invited me to an
event that she chaired.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.365
She dragged me along
to everything.

07:57.389 --> 07:58.889
And where was that?

07:58.913 --> 08:00.847
Whittendale.

08:00.871 --> 08:03.502
Whittendale! They re both alums.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.765
So, what is it you do again?

08:05.789 --> 08:09.943
Some sort of decorating,
something or other?

08:09.967 --> 08:12.250
No, I am an interior designer.

08:12.274 --> 08:15.103
Oh, is that what they
re calling it now?

08:19.194 --> 08:21.172
Who needs a drink? I
know I could use one.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.872
Hey!

08:25.896 --> 08:27.700
Party, party!

08:27.724 --> 08:30.442
Hey, oh my gosh.

08:30.466 --> 08:33.270
I m so glad you made it!

08:33.294 --> 08:34.490
This is my sister, Ellen.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.318
Ellen, this is Joyce and Duane.

08:37.342 --> 08:39.669
Duane is an attorney, and
Ellen is a paralegal.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.105
Cowgill and Chase.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.323
Any thoughts about law school?

08:43.347 --> 08:46.850
Oh yeah, more school
and ridiculous loans.

08:46.874 --> 08:49.417
My firm specializes in
financial services.

08:49.441 --> 08:52.551
To be honest, not
really my cup of tea.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.728
Well, Chester and Field
has a very strong

08:55.752 --> 08:58.296
criminal defence department,
if you re interested...

08:58.320 --> 08:59.993
Thank you.

09:00.017 --> 09:03.630
All right, this isn t a
recruiting luncheon.

09:07.329 --> 09:10.613
Where would you like this wine?

09:10.637 --> 09:12.876
Come with me, I ll show you.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.031
Thank you.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.927
That chick s got a
stick up her butt.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.800
That s Joyce, Lorna s Mom.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.279
Whoa, seriously?

09:25.303 --> 09:26.672
Yeah.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.718
Within the first minute,
she made sure to tell me

09:28.742 --> 09:30.502
that Lorna was the youngest
partner at her firm

09:30.526 --> 09:33.026
and that she went
to Whittendale.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.594
I get it must be hard
meeting me, but come on.

09:35.618 --> 09:38.031
Well you have now done your duty

09:38.055 --> 09:41.252
and you get to sit back
and enjoy the party.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.080
Cheers.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.473
Hey Tina, can I
borrow you for a sec?

09:45.497 --> 09:46.673
Of course.

09:52.374 --> 09:54.831
Tina, this is Petra.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.659
Hi.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.399
I ve heard a lot about you.

09:58.423 --> 09:59.270
Likewise.

09:59.294 --> 10:00.880
Dad, can you help me?

10:00.904 --> 10:02.578
Uh yeah, just a sec hon.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.841
Duty calls, excuse me.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.669
Brock here, I got your favorite.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.018
Oh, thank you.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.236
Yeah, you re welcome.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.196
So...

10:12.220 --> 10:14.851
do you know Brock
from med school?

10:14.875 --> 10:19.856
No, actually Lorna and I were
best friends from college.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.552
Wow.

10:20.576 --> 10:22.012
Yeah.

10:23.361 --> 10:26.645
Tina, I m just going
to be honest with you.

10:26.669 --> 10:30.170
Brock was miserable, he
could barely function

10:30.194 --> 10:32.564
when Lorna died three years ago.

10:32.588 --> 10:35.088
But he s a completely
different person now

10:35.112 --> 10:38.638
and I m eternally
grateful to you for that.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.835
Thank you.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.532
Okay.

10:44.556 --> 10:47.187
Actually, I am in desperate
need for some design advice.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.798
Oh, well I d be happy
to help with that!

10:48.822 --> 10:49.625
Thank you.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.626
Petra.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.452
Joyce!

10:51.476 --> 10:53.019
How are you, sweetheart?

10:53.043 --> 10:54.934
Good, how are you?

10:54.958 --> 10:56.327
Good.

10:56.351 --> 10:59.112
I was just asking Tina to
weigh in on my remodel.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.898
Simon wants to keep his recliner

11:01.922 --> 11:04.727
and I have no idea how
to design a room.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.120
No, first of all,
recliner and design

11:07.144 --> 11:09.557
do not belong in
the same sentence.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.627
Yes, that is what I told him!

11:14.761 --> 11:16.676
Well, I need a refill.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.830
You know what you should
do with that lazy boy?

11:20.854 --> 11:23.595
Take it in the backyard and put
it at the edge of the property.

11:34.737 --> 11:35.583
Hey!

11:35.607 --> 11:37.131
Hey.

11:39.176 --> 11:40.458
How s it going?

11:40.482 --> 11:41.720
Good.

11:41.744 --> 11:42.982
Your friends are pretty great.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.984
Well, you re pretty
great with them.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.464
I m kind of killing
it, aren t I?

11:46.488 --> 11:48.205
You kind of are.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.685
Do you need any help out here?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.165
No, I think we re good.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.713
Hey.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.867
You know how you said that
you didn t want to move in

11:57.891 --> 12:00.696
until we re ready to make
a bigger commitment?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.306
Yeah.

12:02.330 --> 12:05.265
Well, I ve been
thinking about it.

12:05.289 --> 12:08.834
Why are we waiting?

12:08.858 --> 12:10.880
What?

12:10.904 --> 12:12.732
Let s get married.

12:14.298 --> 12:15.623
Seriously?

12:15.647 --> 12:18.235
Seriously.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.150
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.195
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you too,

12:22.219 --> 12:23.283
but what about Harper?

12:23.307 --> 12:25.155
I ve already talked to Harper.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.461
So what do you say?

12:27.485 --> 12:30.900
Will you marry me?

12:30.924 --> 12:32.969
Yes, yes!

12:38.322 --> 12:40.474
I promise, I will buy
you a proper ring.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.631
Any kind of ring that you want.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.132
Oh my gosh!

12:46.156 --> 12:47.612
Oh my gosh, I can t believe it!

12:47.636 --> 12:49.962
We re getting married!

12:49.986 --> 12:52.443
Daddy, you did it! It happened!

12:52.467 --> 12:54.401
Wait Harper, no c mere!

12:54.425 --> 12:55.402
Harper!

12:55.426 --> 12:56.534
Guess what Ellen?

12:56.558 --> 12:58.057
Tina and Daddy are
getting married!

12:58.081 --> 12:59.779
She can t be serious.

13:02.433 --> 13:05.021
It s true, everyone.

13:05.045 --> 13:08.483
Spur of the moment,
but she said yes.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.770
Talk about a bigger commitment!

13:14.794 --> 13:17.318
You better call Mom, or I'm
gonna spill the beans!

13:19.102 --> 13:20.819
Well, congratulations.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.952
Thank you.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.302
Come here!

13:25.326 --> 13:26.936
Okay, photo.

13:31.114 --> 13:33.571
I knew being gone all
summer was a big mistake.

13:33.595 --> 13:34.877
What were you going to do?

13:34.901 --> 13:36.095
Keep him on a leash?

13:36.119 --> 13:38.054
I never said he shouldn
t date, did I?

13:38.078 --> 13:41.144
But getting engaged
after three months?

13:41.168 --> 13:43.886
Nona? What s wrong?

13:43.910 --> 13:45.061
Nothing, Sweets.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.802
Go get in your PJs.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.542
Where s Dad?

13:48.566 --> 13:50.762
He's dropping off Tina,
he ll be back soon.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.092
Okay.

13:53.441 --> 13:55.462
It s fast, I agree.

13:55.486 --> 13:56.899
I mean if he were single, fine.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.770
But he has a child,
my grand daughter.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.622
Who's looking out for her?

14:01.971 --> 14:03.755
Hey guys.

14:05.540 --> 14:06.909
Where s Harper?

14:06.933 --> 14:08.475
She's changing for bed.

14:08.499 --> 14:09.587
Oh, that s good.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.982
That was quite a party, Brock.

14:16.507 --> 14:19.075
I m going to get
started on the dishes.

14:20.511 --> 14:23.316
Listen, Joyce.

14:23.340 --> 14:26.493
I know this is a lot to take in.

14:26.517 --> 14:29.845
Honestly, I didn't plan
on proposing today.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.455
Tina seems like a
very sweet girl,

14:31.479 --> 14:34.197
don t get me wrong.

14:34.221 --> 14:37.635
But to make a life
long commitment now?

14:37.659 --> 14:39.855
How well do you really know
someone after three months?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.682
It's been six months.

14:41.706 --> 14:42.988
I didn t want to make it public

14:43.012 --> 14:44.337
until I knew that
we were serious.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.165
Three, six, c mon Brock!

14:46.189 --> 14:47.819
You and Lorna were
together for two years

14:47.843 --> 14:49.255
before you got engaged.

14:49.279 --> 14:50.802
That was different.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.589
Yes, it was different.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.788
Because you didn t have
Harper to consider.

15:00.812 --> 15:03.443
Tina is great with Harper.

15:03.467 --> 15:06.011
They get along
really, really well.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.361
What happens when there s
a new child in the mix?

15:08.385 --> 15:09.928
Have you discussed that?

15:09.952 --> 15:11.799
Another child, what child Joyce?

15:11.823 --> 15:13.584
A baby, Brock.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.848
Tina could decide
that she wants one.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.632
Tina s having a baby, Dad?

15:18.656 --> 15:21.679
No, Tina is not having a baby.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.986
Listen, I cannot get
into this right now.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.465
I gotta get Harper to bed.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.946
Kiddo, school tomorrow,
we're going to bed.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.993
I want Nona to put me to bed.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.995
Nona has to go home.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.954
Don t be silly, I
missed my girl.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.633
You can go help Duane
with the dishes.

15:44.421 --> 15:46.249
Let s get you in bed.

15:47.816 --> 15:51.927
All right, let s take off
this pretty necklace.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.016
We don t want it to break.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.040
Okay, Nona.

15:57.391 --> 15:58.958
There we go.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.199
What is going on
with this dresser?

16:03.223 --> 16:05.965
I had everything
organized before I left.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.682
Nona?

16:08.706 --> 16:10.554
If Tina has a baby,
that means I ll have

16:10.578 --> 16:13.320
a new sister or brother, right?

16:14.799 --> 16:17.474
Yes, that s right.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.693
But if she does have a new baby,

16:19.717 --> 16:23.132
you ll always be my number one.

16:23.156 --> 16:27.832
You mean Tina will be too
busy to take care of me?

16:27.856 --> 16:31.662
Well, newborns are a lot of work
and Tina s baby will be hers.

16:31.686 --> 16:35.013
Just like you are
your mama s baby.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.710
And mine.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.756
But you ll always have me.

16:38.780 --> 16:42.978
And if you ever need to talk,
just call me anytime, okay?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.327
Our secret.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.961
Okay?

16:47.093 --> 16:51.247
Okay, now say good
night to mama.

16:51.271 --> 16:54.404
Good night mama. I love you.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.759
I miss you every
day, sweet angel.

17:06.502 --> 17:08.089
How are you going to handle
all the wedding planning

17:08.114 --> 17:10.005
with your new business?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.919
I don t know, I ll work it out.

17:11.943 --> 17:14.009
I promise I won t buy a wedding
dress without you, okay?

17:14.032 --> 17:15.358
Well I should hope not!

17:15.382 --> 17:18.361
It may be my one chance,
my only chance.

17:18.385 --> 17:20.015
I heard that, Mom!

17:20.039 --> 17:21.451
All right, I gotta go.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.192
Brock s got early morning rounds

17:23.215 --> 17:25.324
and I have to take
Harper to school.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.065
And apparently deal
with my client

17:27.089 --> 17:29.198
who thinks that the
workday starts at 7.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.635
Send Brock my love and
my congratulations!

17:31.659 --> 17:32.505
I love you, bye.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.290
Bye Mom!

17:34.314 --> 17:35.508
She wasn t listening.

17:35.532 --> 17:36.770
Sorry.

17:36.794 --> 17:39.556
Okay, see you later.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.972
- Bye.
- Bye!

17:56.510 --> 17:57.617
Joyce!

17:57.641 --> 17:58.575
Good morning.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.098
Brock s on his way out.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.579
I know. That s why I m here,
to take Harper to school.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.015
You re taking Harper to school?

18:04.039 --> 18:05.190
Morning.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.931
Tina! Did you bring my sneakers?

18:06.955 --> 18:08.454
You know I did!

18:08.478 --> 18:11.153
Should we try em on,
make sure they fit?

18:11.177 --> 18:12.893
Brock, I thought I was
taking Harper to school.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.243
That s been our routine.

18:14.267 --> 18:15.853
We re trying to
build a new routine

18:15.877 --> 18:17.681
so that Tina and
Harper can bond.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.465
I thought you might like to
have your mornings back?

18:19.489 --> 18:21.032
Brock, being a mother is more

18:21.056 --> 18:23.556
than just showering
a child with gifts.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.992
It s a big responsibility.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.820
She s new to this.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.387
Her heart s in the right place.

18:28.411 --> 18:30.520
They fit great, thanks Tina!

18:30.544 --> 18:32.261
Hey, Tee.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.828
Here is Harper s new
calendar for school.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.613
Can you put it on the fridge
in place of the old one?

18:36.637 --> 18:37.179
Of course.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.267
All right.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.268
Bye, dad!

18:39.292 --> 18:40.617
Bye bye, I ll see you tonight.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.314
Cool.

18:42.338 --> 18:43.731
Joyce!

18:46.386 --> 18:47.754
All right, should we get
you ready for school?

18:47.778 --> 18:49.171
- Yeah.
- Cool.

18:51.478 --> 18:52.585
What d you have for breakfast?

18:52.609 --> 18:54.631
Cereal. What did you have?

18:54.655 --> 18:56.352
Coffee.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.336
Everything okay?

19:04.360 --> 19:07.252
Yeah, just dealing
with a needy client.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.341
Harper, what do you
want for lunch?

19:09.365 --> 19:11.300
Lunch is already packed.

19:11.324 --> 19:12.605
Oh, thank you!

19:12.629 --> 19:14.259
And don t forget your
smoothie, Sweets.

19:14.283 --> 19:16.043
Guess what, Nona?

19:16.067 --> 19:18.785
Tina says they have amazing
papaya smoothies in Hawaii.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.898
Dad and Tina are
going to take me!

19:23.379 --> 19:26.793
You ve already been to Hawaii
with your mother, Harper.

19:26.817 --> 19:27.881
I have?

19:27.905 --> 19:29.429
Yeah, when you were
a little girl.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.673
Well, that just means
you get to go twice.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.588
Lucky you!

19:38.612 --> 19:40.938
Go grab your books, we
gotta hit the road.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.294
Look I know you re busy,

19:49.318 --> 19:53.255
if you want me to take her
to school, I m happy to.

19:53.279 --> 19:56.345
It s all under
control, thank you.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.651
Harper, let s go!

19:58.675 --> 20:00.044
Ready!

20:00.068 --> 20:02.046
Whoa, you re not going anywhere

20:02.070 --> 20:03.787
with your hair looking
like that, young lady!

20:03.811 --> 20:04.962
I already brushed it, Nona.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.790
Well not enough, clearly.

20:06.814 --> 20:08.748
There we go.

20:10.644 --> 20:13.231
I forgot my necklace!

20:13.255 --> 20:15.214
Go get it. Hurry please.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.961
Can you believe this old thing?

20:28.923 --> 20:32.076
This is why Brock needs a
woman like you in the house.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.513
Thanks for packing her lunch.

20:34.537 --> 20:35.514
Yeah.

20:35.538 --> 20:36.863
Tina!

20:36.887 --> 20:38.778
I can t find the necklace
you gave me anywhere.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.040
Okay well, you know what?

20:40.064 --> 20:41.520
We re just gonna have
to find it later,

20:41.544 --> 20:42.782
because we gotta go!

20:42.806 --> 20:44.349
Yeah, go. I ll lock up.

20:44.373 --> 20:45.220
Bye Nona.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.507
Bye, have a good day.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.484
I m just saying something
is off about her.

22:15.508 --> 22:18.051
She s super controlling,
that s for sure.

22:18.075 --> 22:20.227
I think she s always been
a part of Harper s life.

22:20.251 --> 22:21.664
You think?

22:21.688 --> 22:24.057
Brock doesn t talk about
it and I hate asking,

22:24.081 --> 22:27.147
so, you know, what do you do?

22:27.171 --> 22:28.366
Thank you.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.826
Thank you!

22:32.699 --> 22:34.111
He was feeling it.

22:34.135 --> 22:34.851
Eww.

22:34.875 --> 22:36.679
What?

22:36.703 --> 22:39.638
The fact is she lost her only
daughter in a car accident.

22:39.662 --> 22:41.248
That s enough to
make anyone crazy.

22:41.272 --> 22:43.860
Yes, that is tragic.

22:43.884 --> 22:46.558
But this is your marriage, you
ve got to set boundaries.

22:46.582 --> 22:48.081
I did this morning.

22:48.105 --> 22:51.171
I told her I would continue
to take Harper to school.

22:51.195 --> 22:53.739
And she backed off a little.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.829
I still think you should say
something to Brock about it.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.527
So I can come across
as the needy a-hole

22:58.551 --> 23:00.964
trying to get rid of his
late wife s mother?

23:00.988 --> 23:03.445
No, Brock hates drama.

23:03.469 --> 23:08.014
She s a part of Harper s life and
I just have to deal with it.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.431
Good luck.

23:11.694 --> 23:13.716
Duane, I think you
re being ridiculous.

23:13.740 --> 23:17.197
I really don t see
what the issue is.

23:17.221 --> 23:20.462
I just don t think we should be
meddling in their relationship.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.855
How long have you known him?

23:22.879 --> 23:27.469
Have you ever known him
to be this impulsive?

23:27.493 --> 23:29.166
Think about it, this
is a man that takes

23:29.190 --> 23:31.777
seven months to plan a
three day vacation.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.126
Well, that s true.

23:33.150 --> 23:35.520
A quick background check
is all I m asking for.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.217
Just to be safe.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.568
You have that
investigator you use?

23:39.592 --> 23:42.571
For very specific work purposes.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.834
If anything ever
happened to Harper,

23:44.858 --> 23:48.490
would you ever be able
to forgive yourself?

23:48.514 --> 23:50.777
Fine, I ll call Grant.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.415
Do you want some
more salad, Harper?

24:00.439 --> 24:01.483
Yes, please.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.747
Yeah sure, thanks.

24:06.488 --> 24:10.555
So, I reserved a moving truck
for the end of the month.

24:10.579 --> 24:13.079
Which means that you have to
clear out the hallway closet

24:13.103 --> 24:14.690
to make some space
for Tina, okay?

24:14.714 --> 24:16.431
Okay, Dad.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.650
And maybe we can figure
out something to do

24:18.674 --> 24:20.260
with those boxes of nail polish

24:20.284 --> 24:21.914
and lip gloss that are in there.

24:21.938 --> 24:24.047
Hey, a girl needs
to pamper herself.

24:24.071 --> 24:25.396
Oh no!

24:25.420 --> 24:28.443
Pre-teen, already? Eww.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.488
Speaking of which, after
my lunch with Ellen,

24:30.512 --> 24:32.993
I found this cute store
and got you something.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.476
Do you like it?

24:39.347 --> 24:43.196
I figured it was time to
replace your old one.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.614
You threw out my brush?

24:48.356 --> 24:51.509
The handle was really worn
and it was missing bristles.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.380
You shouldn t have done that!

24:53.404 --> 24:55.078
It wasn t yours!

24:55.102 --> 24:57.757
Harper, she didn t know!

24:59.541 --> 25:01.345
Harper!

25:01.369 --> 25:04.130
What did I do?

25:04.154 --> 25:06.481
It was Lorna s.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.179
Oh my God.

25:09.203 --> 25:11.703
I m gonna go talk to her.

25:11.727 --> 25:15.078
Maybe take it easy on the
gifts for a little while?

25:20.475 --> 25:21.911
Harper!

25:32.922 --> 25:37.555
She s finally asleep.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.861
I m really sorry.

25:38.885 --> 25:42.081
I will never do anything
like that again.

25:42.105 --> 25:44.562
Do you think I should say
something to her in the morning?

25:44.586 --> 25:46.085
No, just leave it.

25:46.109 --> 25:48.740
She knows you didn t
do it on purpose.

25:48.764 --> 25:51.264
I just don t want to
mess anything up.

25:51.288 --> 25:54.050
I m not the girlfriend to
goof around with anymore.

25:54.074 --> 25:55.138
We re...

25:55.162 --> 25:56.879
we re getting married.

25:56.903 --> 25:59.838
She wants this. She
does, trust me.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.057
Really?

26:01.081 --> 26:02.561
Yeah.

26:04.998 --> 26:07.217
She s crazy about you.

26:10.090 --> 26:14.287
I hear that that
runs in the family.

26:14.311 --> 26:15.985
Yeah?

26:16.009 --> 26:17.358
Yup.

26:22.972 --> 26:25.105
Oh, hang on.

26:29.413 --> 26:30.608
What is this?

26:30.632 --> 26:31.827
What?

26:31.851 --> 26:35.700
This picture, what is this?

26:35.724 --> 26:38.988
It s from a trip
we took to Kauai.

26:41.687 --> 26:45.014
What is it doing here? I
ve never seen this before.

26:45.038 --> 26:49.758
I don t know, maybe
Harper put it there?

26:49.782 --> 26:52.238
I can t get rid of all
our pictures, Tina.

26:52.262 --> 26:53.413
I know!

26:53.437 --> 26:56.179
I would never ask you
to do that, ever!

27:00.967 --> 27:03.554
I just...

27:03.578 --> 27:06.905
I don t know where your
line is sometimes.

27:06.929 --> 27:11.910
You never talk about
your feelings.

27:11.934 --> 27:14.434
I didn t know we were
talking about our feelings,

27:14.458 --> 27:16.852
I thought we were...

27:19.725 --> 27:21.335
I m sorry.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.164
Come on.

27:26.427 --> 27:29.145
I am spent.

27:29.169 --> 27:31.780
Can we just go to bed?

27:59.112 --> 28:00.655
Harper? What s wrong?

28:00.679 --> 28:01.679
Nona!

28:04.552 --> 28:05.901
I can t sleep.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.490
What is it, Sweets?

28:10.514 --> 28:12.429
Talk to Nona.

28:16.085 --> 28:17.434
All right!

28:19.393 --> 28:23.373
I packed you an extra fruit
roll up so you can trade.

28:23.397 --> 28:25.094
Thanks.

28:27.009 --> 28:29.074
Harper, you need to get dressed.

28:29.098 --> 28:29.771
It s almost eight.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.076
I am dressed.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.599
It s Pajama Day, it
s on the calendar.

28:32.623 --> 28:35.602
Oh. Well, good.

28:35.626 --> 28:36.473
Did you brush your teeth?

28:36.497 --> 28:37.474
Yeah.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.084
All right, let s get going.

28:39.108 --> 28:41.696
Can Dad to take me?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.045
Tina s gonna take you.

28:43.069 --> 28:46.289
You never take me anymore.
Please, Dad?

28:47.813 --> 28:49.660
You can take her, it s okay.

28:49.684 --> 28:52.469
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

28:53.993 --> 28:56.798
But you better get going,
or you re gonna be late.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.190
Hey!

28:58.214 --> 28:59.844
Bye Tina.

28:59.868 --> 29:00.758
Bye.

29:00.782 --> 29:01.914
Bye Tina.

29:12.489 --> 29:14.163
Okay, got it.

29:14.187 --> 29:16.556
No, that should
just about do it.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.191
Thanks, Grant.

29:21.194 --> 29:22.824
Well? What d he say?

29:22.848 --> 29:25.565
She s clean.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.393
Nothing at all?

29:27.417 --> 29:29.395
Nothing except for a few photos

29:29.419 --> 29:32.007
he found online of
her sunbathing.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.617
Nude photos?

29:33.641 --> 29:35.575
This is not porn, dear.

29:35.599 --> 29:39.101
Grant thinks a vindictive
ex must have put them up.

29:39.125 --> 29:42.519
He needs to send them, now!

29:46.480 --> 29:48.763
So I m thinking probably a
week for the initial design

29:48.787 --> 29:50.677
and then we can meet in
person to go over it.

29:50.701 --> 29:51.766
Great, what day?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.463
Does Saturday work for you?

29:53.487 --> 29:54.290
Yeah!

29:54.314 --> 29:56.292
Okay.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.250
Let me get back to you
about a time, okay?

29:58.274 --> 29:59.512
Okay, I m excited.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.079
Great I m excited
too, Libby, thanks.

30:01.103 --> 30:03.429
- Bye.
- Bye.

30:03.453 --> 30:04.909
Hey babe, what s up?

30:04.933 --> 30:06.606
It s not Pajama Day.

30:06.630 --> 30:07.564
What?

30:07.588 --> 30:08.913
Yeah, we showed up and Harper

30:08.937 --> 30:11.611
was literally the
only kid in pajamas.

30:11.635 --> 30:13.396
Oh no!

30:13.420 --> 30:15.746
Yeah, I m going
to give them hell

30:15.770 --> 30:19.861
for putting the wrong
day on the calendar.

30:22.298 --> 30:25.321
I m sorry, that might
actually be my fault.

30:25.345 --> 30:27.584
I thought I gave
you the new one?

30:27.608 --> 30:30.979
You did, but I was frazzled
getting Harper out the door

30:31.003 --> 30:33.851
and I might have left the
new one on the counter.

30:33.875 --> 30:36.114
Do you want me to run home and
get her some new clothes?

30:36.138 --> 30:39.639
No, the teacher had her
put on her gym clothes.

30:39.663 --> 30:43.165
Look, these things
happen, they do.

30:43.189 --> 30:44.993
But they re important
and 10 year olds

30:45.017 --> 30:47.865
are very self-conscious.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.911
I know, I m so sorry!

30:49.935 --> 30:53.566
I m so sorry!

30:53.590 --> 30:54.741
Hey, I ve got to jump.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.874
Can I give you a call later?

30:56.898 --> 30:58.552
Okay, bye.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.588
Hello there, stranger.

31:15.612 --> 31:16.633
Hey.

31:16.657 --> 31:18.635
You staying for dinner?

31:18.659 --> 31:21.507
Yeah, these boxes aren t
going to pack themselves.

31:21.531 --> 31:24.380
I will order Chinese.

31:24.404 --> 31:25.947
Damn girl.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.644
At that rate, you re not
getting out of here

31:27.668 --> 31:29.298
until next Christmas.

31:29.322 --> 31:31.604
Yeah well, the way things have
been going the past week,

31:31.628 --> 31:33.955
maybe that s a better idea.

31:33.979 --> 31:37.088
Stop trying to bribe Harper
with gifts and you ll be fine.

31:37.112 --> 31:40.657
Okay, for the record: Joyce
held up the brush and said:

31:40.681 --> 31:42.964
Can you believe this old thing?

31:42.988 --> 31:45.923
That s why Brock needs a girl
like you around the house.

31:45.947 --> 31:49.535
Uh-huh, and you, desperate
to be the perfect step mom,

31:49.559 --> 31:52.780
ran out and got her a new one.

31:54.782 --> 31:57.456
Oh my God, she set me up.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.241
I bet she knew it
was Lorna s brush

31:59.265 --> 32:01.373
and she knew how
Harper would react.

32:01.397 --> 32:03.854
Seriously, that is just...

32:03.878 --> 32:05.943
- Psycho?
- Yeah!

32:05.967 --> 32:07.597
Yeah.

32:07.621 --> 32:09.884
Brock is going to
hear about this one.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.256
Where would we
have the ceremony?

32:14.280 --> 32:17.215
We could set up a
trellis over there.

32:17.239 --> 32:19.261
Works for me.

32:19.285 --> 32:20.523
What do you think?

32:20.547 --> 32:22.046
Oh, I love it.

32:22.070 --> 32:24.527
I don t have to keep looking.

32:24.551 --> 32:26.224
Me neither.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.531
But I m not waiting 18
months to marry you.

32:28.555 --> 32:32.515
Well, the only other option they
have is six weeks from now.

32:34.213 --> 32:37.932
Let s do it.

32:37.956 --> 32:43.372
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:43.396 --> 32:45.678
You realize a lot of people
probably won t be able

32:45.702 --> 32:47.550
to make it on such short notice.

32:47.574 --> 32:51.206
Good, I was hoping
for a small wedding.

32:51.230 --> 32:52.772
I guess I should
move the tastings.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.687
Can you do Saturday morning
before my meeting with Libby?

32:54.711 --> 32:56.298
Yeah, morning s great.

32:56.322 --> 32:58.169
I don t have to be in the
clinic until afternoon.

32:58.193 --> 33:01.042
Okay, I ll set something
up for Harper.

33:01.066 --> 33:04.199
I think Joyce already set up a
play date with Amber s Mom.

33:13.817 --> 33:17.058
Does this have anything to do
with me screwing up Pajama Day?

33:17.082 --> 33:19.538
What are you talking about?

33:19.562 --> 33:23.629
I m just wondering why Joyce
is scheduling play dates.

33:23.653 --> 33:25.675
Joyce has always been
really involved.

33:25.699 --> 33:28.721
She s helps out a lot.

33:28.745 --> 33:31.420
Well, maybe if she would stop
turning Harper against me,

33:31.444 --> 33:34.249
I could help out too.

33:34.273 --> 33:37.015
Hey, what s going on?

33:39.321 --> 33:42.498
She told me to throw
away the hair brush.

33:44.109 --> 33:46.763
Joyce actually told you that?

33:48.200 --> 33:51.135
No, she implied it.

33:51.159 --> 33:55.096
Look, I m doing the best
that I can to be respectful.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.358
I know that she s
Harper s grandma

33:56.382 --> 33:57.359
and you re both very
attached to her...

33:57.383 --> 33:58.621
Tina...

33:58.645 --> 33:59.622
I know this conversation
isn t comfortable,

33:59.646 --> 34:01.319
but we have to have it!

34:01.343 --> 34:02.146
Tina!

34:02.170 --> 34:03.650
What?

34:05.086 --> 34:07.654
Joyce was driving the car.

34:09.177 --> 34:10.589
What?

34:10.612 --> 34:13.592
When Lorna died.

34:13.616 --> 34:15.377
A truck was turning
left in front of her

34:15.400 --> 34:18.447
and she tried to swerve
and it was too late.

34:23.931 --> 34:27.563
I ve made peace with it
as much as anyone can.

34:27.587 --> 34:30.197
But Joyce...

34:34.724 --> 34:38.268
I can t imagine the
guilt she must feel.

34:38.293 --> 34:41.402
She raised Lorna on her own.

34:41.427 --> 34:43.187
Men came and went, but
Lorna was the only thing

34:43.210 --> 34:45.581
that mattered to her.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.757
They had a complicated
relationship.

34:47.781 --> 34:49.150
She micromanaged Lorna s life,

34:49.174 --> 34:52.630
especially when it
came to Harper.

34:52.655 --> 34:56.940
I don t think she ll
ever forgive herself.

34:56.964 --> 34:58.855
Okay.

34:58.879 --> 35:00.944
I get it, I m sorry.

35:00.968 --> 35:03.468
I ll do my best to make it work.

35:03.492 --> 35:05.103
Thank you.

35:18.899 --> 35:21.443
Joyce, what are you doing here?

35:21.467 --> 35:23.401
The nurse sent me back.

35:23.425 --> 35:26.709
I wanted to have a
word in private.

35:26.733 --> 35:28.406
All right.

35:28.430 --> 35:29.451
Everything okay?

35:29.475 --> 35:31.192
Well, no.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.759
Harper called the other night.

35:33.783 --> 35:36.022
She was very upset.

35:36.046 --> 35:38.373
Tina thought you said something

35:38.397 --> 35:42.028
about Harper needing
a new brush?

35:42.052 --> 35:47.556
Do you really think I would tell
her to throw Lorna s brush away?

35:47.580 --> 35:51.212
My God, Brock!

35:51.236 --> 35:55.825
Tina is sweet, but
it worries me.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.348
She s easing into things.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.220
So is Harper, Brock.

35:59.244 --> 36:01.265
This has been rough on her.

36:01.289 --> 36:04.790
Now you re rushing into
this new marriage?

36:04.814 --> 36:07.315
Harper doesn t feel that way.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.186
Maybe she s not
comfortable telling you

36:09.210 --> 36:13.408
how she really feels.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.410
Look, I wasn t going
to say anything.

36:15.434 --> 36:17.847
But Duane thought I
should mention it.

36:17.871 --> 36:21.198
He did a search on Tina.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.200
Why is Duane doing
a search on Tina?

36:23.224 --> 36:24.810
Because he s a criminal
defense lawyer

36:24.834 --> 36:26.856
and maybe a little on
the paranoid side.

36:26.880 --> 36:30.947
But the point is, after a
straight forward search,

36:30.971 --> 36:32.929
some pictures came up.

36:47.901 --> 36:49.748
Yeah, so?

36:49.772 --> 36:52.055
She s having fun
at her sorority.

36:52.079 --> 36:55.319
Brock, you are bringing
Tina into your life

36:55.343 --> 36:57.191
to raise your daughter.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.757
To be a role model.

36:58.781 --> 37:00.759
Who knows what else
could be out there?

37:00.783 --> 37:04.720
All I m asking is for
you to take a step back

37:04.744 --> 37:07.201
before making things permanent.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.966
Just really think
things through.

37:23.589 --> 37:27.351
I have thought things through.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.310
Joyce, we re getting married.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.486
And what I need from
you is your support

37:31.510 --> 37:35.035
to help make this
easier on Tina.

37:37.646 --> 37:40.930
My support?

37:40.954 --> 37:43.715
You have had nothing but
my support for years.

37:43.739 --> 37:45.587
School drop off,
pickup, homework,

37:45.611 --> 37:48.764
babysitting 24-7.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.635
I know more of the moms of
the kids in Harper s class

37:50.659 --> 37:53.856
than you and Lorna ever did!

37:53.880 --> 37:55.771
You ve done so much.

37:55.795 --> 37:59.122
And I appreciate
all of it, I do.

37:59.146 --> 38:01.472
But Tina wants to be involved.

38:01.496 --> 38:04.388
I want her to be involved.

38:04.412 --> 38:07.565
This is good for
everybody, right?

38:07.589 --> 38:11.874
You can finally get back
to being a grandmother.

38:11.898 --> 38:13.552
Joyce?

38:15.684 --> 38:18.731
Yes, of course.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.212
If that s the way you want it.

38:41.623 --> 38:43.558
Do you really think this is
the best thing for Harper?

38:43.582 --> 38:44.863
I am her mother!

38:44.887 --> 38:46.715
I can decide what
s best for her.

38:52.678 --> 38:55.047
It s not going to kill her
to have cafeteria food

38:55.071 --> 38:57.180
once in awhile.

38:57.204 --> 38:58.877
A homemade lunch
keeps her energy up.

38:58.901 --> 39:01.010
Her energy is fine, Mom!

39:01.034 --> 39:02.403
How would you know?

39:02.427 --> 39:04.143
You re not the one
that drops her off

39:04.167 --> 39:06.605
and picks her up from
school every day.

39:07.954 --> 39:10.106
I m thinking we
should change that.

39:10.130 --> 39:12.804
Maybe bring in a baby sitter.

39:12.828 --> 39:15.154
You ll finally get a break.

39:15.178 --> 39:16.982
While you re busy in
trial for six months?

39:17.006 --> 39:19.071
Do you really think this is
the best thing for Harper?

39:19.095 --> 39:22.031
I m her mother, I can
decide what s best her!

39:22.055 --> 39:24.033
You re all over me
about everything!

39:24.057 --> 39:26.122
Ripping apart every
decision I make!

39:26.146 --> 39:28.342
I have done nothing
but support you.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.083
I have raised your
daughter for seven years,

39:31.107 --> 39:34.348
while you were busy
making partner.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.351
I would never treat
you like this.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.375
Mom!

40:16.414 --> 40:18.285
Tina and Daddy are
getting married!

40:22.463 --> 40:24.813
Daddy and Tina are
going to take me.

40:26.859 --> 40:29.228
No, no, no!

40:29.252 --> 40:30.708
Not happening to me!

40:30.732 --> 40:32.299
Not happening!

41:28.573 --> 41:30.638
So where are you girls going?

41:30.662 --> 41:32.335
We re going to get
a slice of pie.

41:32.359 --> 41:33.641
You know that new place?

41:33.665 --> 41:35.556
The one on Western?

41:35.580 --> 41:37.166
I m not sure how long I ll be.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.341
Take your time.

41:38.365 --> 41:40.169
Okay.

41:40.193 --> 41:43.999
I just really want
to support Petra.

41:44.023 --> 41:47.568
She s having a hard time with
Brock moving on so quickly.

41:47.592 --> 41:48.569
Give her my regards.

41:48.593 --> 41:49.831
I will, love you.

41:49.855 --> 41:51.421
You too.

42:14.053 --> 42:15.596
Excuse me.

42:15.620 --> 42:18.163
I m looking for 22 Point Cliff?

42:18.187 --> 42:19.730
Joyce?

42:19.754 --> 42:21.602
Hey, I m Grant.

42:21.626 --> 42:25.388
Sorry, the streets can
be a little confusing.

42:25.412 --> 42:27.695
You re the private investigator?

42:27.719 --> 42:29.653
That s what the card says.

42:29.677 --> 42:31.829
Where exactly is your office?

42:31.853 --> 42:33.942
You re looking at it.

42:38.294 --> 42:40.272
So if we knock down
the south wall,

42:40.296 --> 42:43.188
I suggest that we set
up a train track area

42:43.212 --> 42:46.148
to keep the kids busy and
allow the mothers to shop.

42:46.172 --> 42:47.628
Brilliant, I love that idea.

42:47.652 --> 42:48.759
What about finishes?

42:48.783 --> 42:50.369
Have you given any
thought to that?

42:50.393 --> 42:51.545
Yes.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.677
I feel like it should
be clean and modern,

42:53.701 --> 42:55.636
with just a hint of vintage.

42:55.660 --> 42:57.115
But definitely kid friendly.

42:57.139 --> 43:00.466
I like it!

43:00.490 --> 43:01.990
Would you excuse
me just a second?

43:02.014 --> 43:03.668
Yeah, sure.

43:07.367 --> 43:08.779
Hi.

43:08.803 --> 43:11.390
Can I help you?

43:11.414 --> 43:13.828
Detective Vic Jeffers.

43:13.852 --> 43:16.395
I m looking for Ms.
Tina Williams.

43:16.419 --> 43:17.919
Yeah, that s me.

43:17.943 --> 43:20.095
What is this regarding?

43:20.119 --> 43:23.751
Are you familiar
with Kristen Scott?

43:23.775 --> 43:27.189
Yes, she s my old
business partner.

43:27.213 --> 43:30.192
Is everything okay,
did something happen?

43:30.216 --> 43:32.324
We received information
that you stole her identity

43:32.348 --> 43:34.718
and racked up charges
on her credit cards.

43:34.742 --> 43:36.764
What?

43:36.788 --> 43:38.548
That s ridiculous!

43:38.572 --> 43:39.897
She believes you
did it to damage

43:39.921 --> 43:41.420
her credit and reputation.

43:41.444 --> 43:43.292
I have absolutely nothing
to do with this!

43:43.316 --> 43:45.599
We re conducting a
criminal investigation.

43:45.623 --> 43:48.427
I m going to have to ask
you some questions.

43:48.451 --> 43:50.778
Well...

43:50.802 --> 43:52.693
of course.

43:52.717 --> 43:55.023
Just let me finish with
my client, please?

43:57.025 --> 43:58.220
Take your time.

43:58.244 --> 43:59.700
I need to get back
to the shop anyway.

43:59.724 --> 44:01.353
I have no idea what
this is about...

44:01.377 --> 44:04.206
No need to explain. Thank you!

44:09.908 --> 44:11.649
How can I help?

44:13.172 --> 44:14.628
This is Kristen.

44:14.652 --> 44:17.718
I m not here, so please
leave a message.

44:17.742 --> 44:19.763
Hi Kristen, it s Tina.

44:19.787 --> 44:22.200
I have no idea what s going
on, but I assure you

44:22.224 --> 44:25.290
I would never do anything to
harm you or your business.

44:25.314 --> 44:28.032
So just give me a
call back, bye.

44:28.056 --> 44:29.120
Tina Williams.

44:29.144 --> 44:31.035
It s Jamie, Amber s Mom.

44:31.059 --> 44:32.820
Hi Jamie, I m on my way.

44:32.844 --> 44:34.952
No need, Joyce already
picked Harper up.

44:34.976 --> 44:35.823
What?

44:35.847 --> 44:37.172
I couldn t reach you.

44:37.196 --> 44:39.174
I needed Harper
picked up by one.

44:39.198 --> 44:40.610
Joyce told me two.

44:40.634 --> 44:42.090
Amber has a recital at two.

44:42.114 --> 44:43.657
We barely made it in time.

44:43.681 --> 44:46.398
I tried to call you earlier,
but you never responded.

44:46.422 --> 44:48.226
I was in a meeting.

44:48.250 --> 44:50.968
Next time, you probably want
to keep your phone close by.

44:50.992 --> 44:53.255
I always do, even when
I m in a meeting.

44:54.343 --> 44:55.910
Really?

44:59.653 --> 45:02.284
Schedule an ultrasound for Mrs.
Benson, please.

45:02.308 --> 45:03.352
Thanks.

45:07.530 --> 45:09.595
Hey hon, how was Libby?

45:09.619 --> 45:11.859
Kristen s accusing me of
stealing her identity.

45:11.883 --> 45:13.295
What?

45:13.319 --> 45:14.949
I need to talk to
you, this is crazy.

45:14.973 --> 45:16.080
I ll come meet you.

45:16.104 --> 45:17.125
I m at the apartment.

45:17.149 --> 45:18.779
Okay.

45:18.803 --> 45:20.998
Can you ask Dr. Chen
to cover me?

45:21.022 --> 45:23.633
I need to be out the
rest of the afternoon.

45:28.813 --> 45:30.181
Hey, we re back.

45:30.205 --> 45:31.748
Hi!

45:31.772 --> 45:33.271
Thanks for staying with Harper.

45:33.295 --> 45:35.447
Happy I could help.

45:37.082 --> 45:38.799
It s Ellen, I gotta take this.

45:38.823 --> 45:40.888
Everything okay?

45:40.912 --> 45:43.455
She s having some issues with
a former business partner

45:43.479 --> 45:45.893
who s accusing her of some
pretty serious stuff.

45:45.917 --> 45:46.807
How awful.

45:46.831 --> 45:48.330
Yeah. Where s Harper?

45:48.354 --> 45:49.940
She s upstairs watching a movie.

45:49.964 --> 45:51.463
I didn t know what
time you d be back,

45:51.487 --> 45:52.900
so I made dinner.

45:52.924 --> 45:54.379
Thank you, you re a huge help.

45:54.403 --> 45:56.362
I need a beer.

46:00.279 --> 46:04.302
Well, I m just glad I was around
for the mix up with Amber s Mom.

46:04.326 --> 46:08.089
What mix up?

46:08.113 --> 46:11.769
Tina got the time wrong and
Harper was left stranded.

46:14.336 --> 46:17.098
Why didn t Amber s Mom call her?

46:17.122 --> 46:20.797
She did, several times.

46:20.821 --> 46:23.191
Look, I know Tina
has a lot going on,

46:23.215 --> 46:25.933
but parents should know
they need to be reachable

46:25.957 --> 46:27.697
no matter what.

46:29.134 --> 46:31.353
I m gonna tell Harper
that dinner s ready.

46:33.834 --> 46:35.812
Yeah, okay.

46:35.836 --> 46:37.640
All right, thanks, El.

46:37.664 --> 46:40.145
I ll keep you posted, bye.

46:42.234 --> 46:43.777
She s gonna ask one
of the lawyers

46:43.801 --> 46:45.039
at her firm to advise me.

46:45.063 --> 46:46.475
Good.

46:46.499 --> 46:49.217
I m glad she did that for you.

46:49.241 --> 46:51.785
I don t understand why
this is happening.

46:51.809 --> 46:54.439
When we split a year ago, I bent
over backwards for Kristen.

46:54.463 --> 46:56.050
I took one client, she took ten.

46:56.074 --> 46:57.747
So why does she think that

46:57.771 --> 46:59.488
you re trying to
ruin her credit?

46:59.512 --> 47:01.142
Because she s nuts!

47:01.166 --> 47:04.319
This is why we re not
working together anymore.

47:04.343 --> 47:06.800
I didn t know that you
felt that way about her.

47:06.824 --> 47:10.586
I was trying to move
on and focus my energy

47:10.610 --> 47:13.831
into building my own
business, you know?

47:15.920 --> 47:17.985
You believe me, right?

47:18.009 --> 47:21.162
Hey, yes!

47:21.186 --> 47:23.120
Of course, come here.

47:23.144 --> 47:26.428
Hey, it s going to be okay.

47:26.452 --> 47:27.995
We re a team, we re
gonna get through this

47:28.019 --> 47:29.716
together, all right?

47:34.677 --> 47:36.264
You did your job,
you set her up,

47:36.288 --> 47:37.918
but it s still not enough.

47:37.942 --> 47:39.528
An ongoing criminal
investigation

47:39.552 --> 47:40.921
and he s sticking by her.

47:40.945 --> 47:42.705
Can you believe this?

47:42.729 --> 47:46.013
You know what they
say about guys.

47:46.037 --> 47:47.536
I don t need a lecture
from an adolescent

47:47.560 --> 47:50.974
about the male anatomy.

47:50.998 --> 47:53.107
Wait until they press charges.

47:53.131 --> 47:54.935
That s bound to
give him cold feet.

47:54.959 --> 47:56.588
The wedding is in six weeks.

47:56.612 --> 47:59.504
I don t have time to wait.

47:59.528 --> 48:01.115
What about her past
relationships?

48:01.139 --> 48:02.420
Didn't you find anything

48:02.444 --> 48:06.207
on your state of the
art equipment here?

48:06.231 --> 48:08.687
She has had one
serious relationship

48:08.711 --> 48:10.776
before your son-in-law.

48:10.800 --> 48:12.454
Chad Davis.

48:14.065 --> 48:15.825
He s an investment banker.

48:15.849 --> 48:19.655
They co-signed an apartment
lease for eight years.

48:19.679 --> 48:22.963
She d never invest that
much time without a ring.

48:22.987 --> 48:25.443
Well, it ended last May.

48:25.467 --> 48:27.881
Although...

48:27.905 --> 48:31.082
it seems he kept his
name on her car lease.

48:35.260 --> 48:37.784
So maybe he s holding out hope?

48:44.312 --> 48:46.247
Is Tina headed to
the office today?

48:46.271 --> 48:48.989
She s gotta get some paperwork
together for the lawyer.

48:49.013 --> 48:50.773
Poor thing.

48:50.797 --> 48:53.254
Well, why don t you stop by

48:53.278 --> 48:55.560
and bring her some
cookies on your way in?

48:55.584 --> 48:56.997
Cheer her up.

48:57.021 --> 48:58.781
Yeah, I could do that.

48:58.805 --> 49:00.565
That s very sweet
of you, thank you.

49:00.589 --> 49:02.567
No pun intended.

49:02.591 --> 49:03.917
Hey, be good for Nona.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.005
Don t worry Dad, I will.

49:05.029 --> 49:06.944
- Bye Joyce.
- Bye.

49:09.816 --> 49:11.794
Here, you keep stirring.

49:11.818 --> 49:14.255
I've got to make a quick call.

49:23.264 --> 49:24.459
Yep?

49:24.483 --> 49:26.940
It s Joyce, she s in the office.

49:26.964 --> 49:29.420
Go ahead and send
the e-mail now.

49:29.444 --> 49:31.229
Okay, I m on it.

49:34.058 --> 49:37.235
Alrighty, let s add the nuts.

49:39.541 --> 49:40.649
Let me get this straight.

49:40.673 --> 49:42.172
I have to hire a cyber
expert to prove

49:42.196 --> 49:43.304
something that I didn t do?

49:43.328 --> 49:44.653
Does that make sense?

49:44.677 --> 49:46.133
If you want to stay out of jail.

49:46.157 --> 49:48.178
Trust me, I don t want to
go to jail either, but...

49:48.202 --> 49:49.614
Fine, add it to my tab.

49:49.638 --> 49:51.094
Thanks Jim, bye.

49:51.118 --> 49:52.511
Tina?

49:55.601 --> 49:58.101
Chad.

49:58.125 --> 49:59.276
Hi.

49:59.300 --> 50:00.930
What are you doing here?

50:00.954 --> 50:03.846
I was in the area
meeting a client.

50:03.870 --> 50:06.022
Can I have a word?

50:06.046 --> 50:07.439
Fine.

50:10.181 --> 50:12.376
Wow.

50:12.400 --> 50:15.423
This space looks great.

50:15.447 --> 50:17.797
It s a work in progress.

50:19.712 --> 50:21.516
Why are you here?

50:21.540 --> 50:24.606
I had a lot of time to
think over the summer.

50:24.630 --> 50:26.956
About us.

50:26.980 --> 50:30.046
Right, and I m the
one that got away.

50:30.070 --> 50:32.092
And you always want
what you can t have.

50:32.116 --> 50:33.856
I was an idiot.

50:35.119 --> 50:36.487
I m engaged.

50:36.511 --> 50:38.968
I m aware.

50:38.992 --> 50:43.146
And I wouldn t be here, if I
didn t think I had a good shot.

50:43.170 --> 50:45.148
I know things aren t great.

50:45.172 --> 50:46.541
What? Who told you that?

50:46.565 --> 50:47.455
Ellen.

50:47.479 --> 50:49.046
Ellen?

50:53.572 --> 50:54.592
Brock?

50:54.616 --> 50:56.072
Hey, what s up?

50:56.096 --> 50:57.576
I m Chad.

51:01.145 --> 51:04.365
Okay, guess I ll see myself out.

51:07.629 --> 51:09.544
Nice to meet you man.

51:14.245 --> 51:15.744
I didn t ask him to come here.

51:15.768 --> 51:17.596
He just showed up.

51:22.514 --> 51:25.778
You re telling people things
aren t great with us?

51:28.172 --> 51:32.132
I vented to Ellen one
time, that s it.

51:34.134 --> 51:36.547
My life is complicated.

51:36.571 --> 51:40.464
It s a lot to take
on with Harper.

51:40.488 --> 51:43.772
You don t think I
can handle Harper?

51:43.796 --> 51:46.277
I think she s a big
responsibility.

51:47.843 --> 51:49.865
If this is about that play date,

51:49.889 --> 51:51.519
if I knew I had to
be there at one,

51:51.543 --> 51:53.173
I never would have
agreed to pick her up.

51:53.197 --> 51:56.852
It was right in the middle of
my meeting with Libby and I...

51:58.376 --> 51:59.701
I messed up.

51:59.725 --> 52:02.225
I m not beating
you up over that.

52:02.249 --> 52:05.165
Come on, you have ten
years experience on me.

52:07.036 --> 52:09.624
Tina...

52:09.648 --> 52:12.931
do you really want this?

52:12.955 --> 52:15.001
Of course I want this!

52:19.701 --> 52:23.227
The question is whether
or not you want this.

52:34.977 --> 52:37.956
Sometimes I wonder if this
whole thing is moving so fast

52:37.980 --> 52:41.506
because if you pause
for a second, you...

52:43.508 --> 52:46.443
I d miss Lorna?

52:46.467 --> 52:48.619
Yeah.

52:48.643 --> 52:53.450
I do, every day.

52:53.474 --> 52:56.192
But I need to get
on with my life.

52:56.216 --> 52:59.369
She d want me to be happy and...

52:59.393 --> 53:01.874
you make me happy.

53:03.397 --> 53:05.747
You make me happy, too.

53:14.713 --> 53:17.082
So, why have you been
talking to Chad?

53:17.106 --> 53:18.345
I have not talked to Chad.

53:18.369 --> 53:21.565
I have zero interest
in speaking to Chad!

53:21.589 --> 53:24.046
Look, I have a police detective
breathing down my neck,

53:24.070 --> 53:25.961
and now Brock is
wondering whether or not

53:25.985 --> 53:28.137
I m fit to raise a child.

53:28.161 --> 53:29.834
Okay, I cannot deal
with this right now.

53:29.858 --> 53:32.446
I swear to you, I have
not spoken to Chad

53:32.470 --> 53:34.709
since you guys broke up.

53:34.733 --> 53:36.885
Then why would he
say that you did?

53:36.909 --> 53:39.148
Because he s a
manipulative jerk.

53:39.172 --> 53:40.628
He knows exactly
how to get to you.

53:40.652 --> 53:42.282
He always has and
he always will!

53:42.306 --> 53:44.719
Why now?

53:44.743 --> 53:46.329
You ve gotten a lot of
congratulatory posts

53:46.353 --> 53:48.070
about your engagement.

53:48.094 --> 53:51.900
You guys still have a
lot of mutual friends.

53:51.924 --> 53:53.597
Yeah, that s true.

53:53.621 --> 53:55.730
Unfriend them immediately.

53:55.754 --> 53:59.473
What I don t understand is
while Chad was at my office,

53:59.497 --> 54:02.606
Brock showed up with a
tin of homemade cookies.

54:02.630 --> 54:04.652
Brock made cookies?

54:04.676 --> 54:07.045
That is weird.

54:07.069 --> 54:09.898
No, Joyce and Harper did.

54:13.424 --> 54:14.923
Joyce!

54:14.947 --> 54:16.620
Again.

54:16.644 --> 54:20.189
Wait, you think Joyce
set this up too?

54:20.213 --> 54:23.758
I can t say anything about it
to Brock until I have proof.

54:23.782 --> 54:27.022
I m sure as hell not
talking to Chad about it.

54:27.046 --> 54:28.763
I ll talk to Chad.

54:28.787 --> 54:29.787
Really?

54:31.485 --> 54:33.270
You owe me.

54:37.230 --> 54:39.600
Mom!

54:39.624 --> 54:41.166
There she is...

54:41.190 --> 54:42.757
the bride!

54:45.891 --> 54:48.197
I am right here, woman!

55:06.346 --> 55:08.803
Oh, you look gorgeous!

55:08.827 --> 55:10.568
Thanks.

55:11.699 --> 55:13.373
Oh, no.

55:13.397 --> 55:16.680
There s no way I m letting you
spend $4,000 on a wedding dress!

55:16.704 --> 55:19.901
Oh honey, it ll probably be
the only time I get to do it.

55:19.925 --> 55:21.468
From your mouth to God s ears.

55:21.492 --> 55:24.862
Now this, this is a bridesmaid
s dress I can wear again.

55:24.886 --> 55:26.037
No!

55:26.061 --> 55:28.170
No stealing my thunder.

55:28.194 --> 55:30.718
Hello? 10! 9.8. You're good.

55:33.242 --> 55:35.482
That s where you
keep your phone?

55:35.506 --> 55:37.484
Yeah, it s close.

55:37.508 --> 55:38.746
Eww.

55:38.770 --> 55:40.225
News on the Chad front.

55:40.249 --> 55:42.097
You are not talking to Chad!

55:42.121 --> 55:43.925
No, I m not. Ellen is.

55:43.949 --> 55:45.230
I m hooking up with him.

55:45.254 --> 55:47.885
I m kidding, Mom!

55:47.909 --> 55:51.976
Okay, he said he deleted the
email thread with fake Ellen.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.456
Dammit!

55:53.480 --> 55:56.198
He said the email
looked totally legit.

55:56.222 --> 55:57.982
Had my law firm name
and everything.

55:58.006 --> 55:59.941
What is this email exchange?

55:59.965 --> 56:01.638
What are you up to, girls?

56:01.662 --> 56:03.684
It just has to do with
her psycho in-law.

56:03.708 --> 56:05.555
Alright, you listen to me.

56:05.579 --> 56:11.213
You have got to stop this
psycho in-law business.

56:11.237 --> 56:12.910
All day long, I ve been
hearing nothing but digs

56:12.934 --> 56:14.738
against this poor woman.

56:14.762 --> 56:18.481
You want to get along, you
have to make nice-nice!

56:18.505 --> 56:20.744
I m serious, girls!

56:20.768 --> 56:24.879
Mom, this situation is way more
complicated than you think.

56:24.903 --> 56:26.818
Leave it to me.

56:28.689 --> 56:30.082
Ugh, where are they?

56:32.737 --> 56:34.454
Hey guys!

56:34.478 --> 56:35.957
Hi sweetie!

56:37.350 --> 56:38.849
You must be Joyce!

56:38.873 --> 56:40.503
You know I told Tina,

56:40.527 --> 56:42.940
even though I m only
gonna be here for a day,

56:42.964 --> 56:44.899
I simply must meet Joyce.

56:44.923 --> 56:46.640
I m glad you did.

56:46.664 --> 56:48.250
And you must be Harper.

56:48.274 --> 56:49.686
You re Tina s Mom?

56:49.710 --> 56:52.167
And mine.

56:52.191 --> 56:53.516
Table s ready guys.

56:53.540 --> 56:55.083
Good!

56:55.107 --> 56:55.953
Hungry?

56:55.977 --> 56:57.936
- Yeah!
- Okay.

57:08.076 --> 57:10.403
Don t you just love this place?

57:10.427 --> 57:13.318
The girls always bring
me here when I visit.

57:13.342 --> 57:17.042
Before I forget, I have a little
surprise here for Harper.

57:19.740 --> 57:21.501
A Chocolate Pen?

57:21.525 --> 57:23.067
Amber has one too!

57:23.091 --> 57:24.504
I ve always wanted one of these!

57:24.528 --> 57:26.027
Look, Nona!

57:26.051 --> 57:27.681
Well, it s a hit.

57:27.705 --> 57:29.639
My granddaughters
turned me on to them.

57:29.663 --> 57:31.032
They can t wait to meet you.

57:31.056 --> 57:33.904
They re going to be
your new cousins.

57:33.928 --> 57:36.559
I m going to have cousins, Nona!

57:36.583 --> 57:38.866
I ve never had cousins before!

57:38.890 --> 57:43.566
Well then, maybe you can
spend the summer with us.

57:43.590 --> 57:44.785
With my cousins?

57:44.809 --> 57:47.744
With your cousins and
uncles and aunties.

57:47.768 --> 57:49.901
And my new Grandma.

57:59.258 --> 58:01.062
Petra?

58:01.086 --> 58:02.106
Hi.

58:02.130 --> 58:04.152
Hey, how are you?

58:04.176 --> 58:05.196
Good to see you.

58:05.220 --> 58:06.589
You too!

58:06.613 --> 58:08.504
I wanted to tell you,
Joyce has really enjoyed

58:08.528 --> 58:09.897
spending time with you.

58:09.921 --> 58:11.681
I think it s been good for her.

58:11.705 --> 58:15.250
She's had a struggle with how
quickly Brock has moved on.

58:15.274 --> 58:17.382
You two had coffee together
a couple of weeks ago

58:17.406 --> 58:18.471
and dessert the other night?

58:18.495 --> 58:19.689
No...

58:19.713 --> 58:22.300
Gosh, I haven t seen
Joyce since the party.

58:22.324 --> 58:24.215
Really?

58:24.239 --> 58:26.590
Yeah, is everything okay?

58:28.766 --> 58:30.570
Yeah, everything s great.

58:30.594 --> 58:32.876
Good to see you.

58:32.900 --> 58:34.008
Well, give Joyce my love.

58:34.032 --> 58:35.096
I will!

58:35.120 --> 58:36.227
All right, take care Duane.

58:36.251 --> 58:38.079
See you later.

58:45.609 --> 58:47.761
So good we had time
to meet, Joyce.

58:47.785 --> 58:50.024
Yes.

58:50.048 --> 58:52.374
Well, we should get
you home, Sweets.

58:52.398 --> 58:55.595
But I want to go to the
airport with Grandma.

58:55.619 --> 58:57.814
Nona wants to take you home.

58:57.838 --> 58:59.599
You ll see me next
time, sweetheart.

58:59.623 --> 59:00.817
But that s not
until the wedding!

59:00.841 --> 59:01.688
I know.

59:01.712 --> 59:03.124
Excuse me, it s the lawyer.

59:03.148 --> 59:05.518
I ll be right back.

59:05.542 --> 59:07.041
Hey Jim, how s it going?

59:07.065 --> 59:08.477
Please?

59:08.501 --> 59:10.000
I want to come with you!

59:10.024 --> 59:11.765
I know!

59:15.595 --> 59:18.269
Okay, just keep me posted.

59:18.293 --> 59:19.599
Bye.

59:21.993 --> 59:24.667
Well, the cyber expert
tracked down the IP address

59:24.691 --> 59:27.235
used to send the threatening
email to Kristen.

59:27.259 --> 59:29.217
A coffee shop on the west side.

59:30.654 --> 59:32.283
Okay.

59:32.307 --> 59:35.156
At least that ll get the
police off your back.

59:35.180 --> 59:36.766
She s got a vendetta.

59:36.790 --> 59:38.768
She ll just say I used
my personal laptop.

59:38.792 --> 59:40.335
This is ridiculous!

59:40.359 --> 59:42.380
You need to get a better lawyer.

59:42.404 --> 59:46.515
And Ellen, is this really
the best that you can do?

59:46.539 --> 59:50.475
The best that I could do is have
Duane s firm to represent her.

59:50.499 --> 59:51.999
They re the best criminal
defense team in the city.

59:52.023 --> 59:55.132
Oh...

59:55.156 --> 59:57.221
Duane takes on
much bigger cases.

59:57.245 --> 59:58.962
Corporate cases.

59:58.986 --> 01:00:00.747
You know, he strikes
me as the type

01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:02.575
that would stick his neck out.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:05.273
He can t talk to a partner?

01:00:05.297 --> 01:00:08.798
Well, I ll certainly ask.

01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:10.757
Thank you, Joyce.

01:00:10.781 --> 01:00:12.193
Well, you need to go.

01:00:12.217 --> 01:00:13.237
You need to get to the airport.

01:00:13.261 --> 01:00:16.327
Please?

01:00:16.351 --> 01:00:18.416
Okay.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.008
Give your Nona a hug.

01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:25.293
Thank you, Nona.

01:00:25.317 --> 01:00:27.077
You re welcome.

01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:29.364
All right, we gotta go.

01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:53.103
Joyce?

01:00:53.127 --> 01:00:55.497
I ran into Petra today.

01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:58.761
She said she hasn't
met with you.

01:00:58.785 --> 01:01:01.222
For pie or coffee.

01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:05.052
I m going to take a bath.

01:01:25.159 --> 01:01:26.963
Grant called me.

01:01:26.987 --> 01:01:30.793
He told me you ve been
meeting with him.

01:01:30.817 --> 01:01:33.230
Well, you weren t
going to do anything.

01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:34.754
Dammit, Joyce!

01:01:34.778 --> 01:01:37.147
Why can't you just let this go?

01:01:37.171 --> 01:01:39.236
You mean just stand
by and watch her

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.586
take Harper away from me?

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:44.459
I knew this was going to
happen from the beginning.

01:01:44.483 --> 01:01:46.243
As soon as she
entered the picture.

01:01:46.267 --> 01:01:48.332
You have got to go
to the police...

01:01:48.356 --> 01:01:50.334
With all her niceness
and sweet smiles.

01:01:50.358 --> 01:01:51.771
Go hug your Nona!

01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:55.035
Like I m some kind
of charity case!

01:01:55.059 --> 01:01:57.428
Joyce, you have got
to come forward.

01:01:57.452 --> 01:02:00.388
She s facing all kinds
of serious charges!

01:02:00.412 --> 01:02:02.042
You were always on her side.

01:02:02.066 --> 01:02:04.764
I m on the side of the law!

01:02:05.547 --> 01:02:07.308
Joyce!

01:02:07.332 --> 01:02:09.049
Dammit, Joyce!

01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:11.902
If you don t go to
the police, I will.

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:21.670
And who's gonna think I
could do this on my own?

01:02:21.694 --> 01:02:24.455
You re the one
with the contacts.

01:02:24.479 --> 01:02:27.937
Your name is all over
my emails to Grant.

01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:30.113
You could be disbarred.

01:02:30.137 --> 01:02:31.811
Lose your license.

01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:34.446
Or worse...

01:02:36.448 --> 01:02:39.146
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:50.984
I need a pill.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:57.686
Hurry!

01:03:09.655 --> 01:03:12.005
Joyce...

01:03:16.836 --> 01:03:18.664
Joyce!

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:51.653
Time to delete all the
mutual friends with Chad.

01:03:54.178 --> 01:03:57.703
Notification... Lorna's page?

01:04:02.664 --> 01:04:05.276
My true love, now and forever?

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:12.520
Hey.

01:04:12.544 --> 01:04:15.634
Harper is asking for
a good night kiss.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.032
Hey, what's going on?

01:04:23.598 --> 01:04:25.881
I m confused.

01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:28.081
Are we getting married too soon?

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:30.910
Hey!

01:04:32.607 --> 01:04:34.759
We ve been through this.

01:04:34.783 --> 01:04:38.111
Yeah, but your post makes
me think otherwise.

01:04:38.135 --> 01:04:39.808
My post?

01:04:39.832 --> 01:04:42.767
On Lorna s Memorial Page.

01:04:42.791 --> 01:04:46.815
If you need more time,
then you should take it.

01:04:46.839 --> 01:04:49.557
I did not post that.

01:04:49.581 --> 01:04:52.865
I did about two years ago,
but I didn t re-post it.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:55.519
Then who did? Harper?

01:04:55.543 --> 01:04:58.938
Harper doesn t know
about this page.

01:04:59.721 --> 01:05:01.090
But Joyce does.

01:05:01.114 --> 01:05:03.049
Joyce doesn't have
access to my account.

01:05:03.073 --> 01:05:06.704
Maybe she got ahold of
your iPad or something.

01:05:06.728 --> 01:05:10.099
How? She doesn't
have my passcode.

01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:11.318
Then she found another way.

01:05:11.342 --> 01:05:12.493
I don't know what to tell you.

01:05:12.517 --> 01:05:15.104
She doesn't want me around!

01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:16.976
What?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.589
Tina, Joyce is just
worried about Harper.

01:05:21.613 --> 01:05:24.374
Right, and I can never fill

01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:27.377
the shoes of her
perfect daughter.

01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:28.901
Hey, I get it.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:32.556
I know Joyce can be a bit much.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.800
She's Harper's grandmother.

01:05:36.323 --> 01:05:38.693
I'm trying to make this
whole thing work here.

01:05:38.717 --> 01:05:41.435
For Harper's sake.

01:05:41.459 --> 01:05:45.395
Can you just roll with me a
little bit on this, please?

01:05:45.419 --> 01:05:47.528
Please?

01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:51.706
I gotta take this.

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.926
I m on call.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:54.796
Hello?

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.145
Brock, I need your help!

01:05:56.169 --> 01:05:57.842
I need you to come
over right now.

01:05:57.866 --> 01:05:59.453
Joyce?

01:05:59.477 --> 01:06:00.236
I already called 911, but
they're not here yet.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.411
What s wrong?

01:06:01.435 --> 01:06:03.413
Duane collapsed, I
think it's his heart.

01:06:03.437 --> 01:06:04.371
Please hurry!

01:06:04.395 --> 01:06:09.811
Yeah, I ll be right there.

01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:11.334
Joyce thinks that Duane
is having a heart attack.

01:06:11.358 --> 01:06:13.056
I ll be back soon.

01:06:33.206 --> 01:06:35.643
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh...

01:06:37.297 --> 01:06:38.883
Is it true?

01:06:38.907 --> 01:06:41.234
One pill would've saved him?

01:06:41.258 --> 01:06:43.062
Maybe it could have bought
him a little more time.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:44.411
I looked everywhere
for the pills.

01:06:44.435 --> 01:06:47.762
I couldn t find them anywhere.

01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:52.114
I don t think I want
to be alone right now.

01:06:52.138 --> 01:06:54.769
Would you mind staying with
me for a little while?

01:06:54.793 --> 01:06:56.510
Yeah of course, I ll stay.

01:06:56.534 --> 01:06:58.101
Thank you.

01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:06.824
Whoa kiddo, let me
help you with that!

01:07:06.848 --> 01:07:08.261
I got it, Dad!

01:07:08.285 --> 01:07:10.156
Let me take one side...

01:07:17.946 --> 01:07:20.795
Poor Duane...

01:07:20.819 --> 01:07:23.580
It s so sad, he was
such a nice man.

01:07:23.604 --> 01:07:26.931
I can t believe he s gone.

01:07:26.955 --> 01:07:28.542
The weird thing is
they don't know

01:07:28.566 --> 01:07:30.457
what happened to his
nitroglycerin pills.

01:07:30.481 --> 01:07:31.806
It s like they just vanished.

01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:33.068
Brock called the pharmacy,

01:07:33.092 --> 01:07:34.983
he had them refilled last week.

01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:37.464
And once again, the
common denominator is...

01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:39.814
No, no, don t say it.

01:07:39.838 --> 01:07:41.120
Hey Tina?

01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:42.817
Where are we putting
the dresser again?

01:07:42.841 --> 01:07:44.775
Hang on one sec!

01:07:44.799 --> 01:07:46.821
My advice to you is
after the wedding,

01:07:46.845 --> 01:07:49.650
get as far away from that
woman as you possible can.

01:07:49.674 --> 01:07:51.173
Like, out of the city.

01:07:51.197 --> 01:07:54.742
I'm already looking at
houses in Palmdale.

01:07:54.766 --> 01:07:55.569
Hey Tee?

01:07:55.593 --> 01:07:56.265
I'm coming!

01:07:56.289 --> 01:07:57.289
All right!

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:13.326
Come on girls, we gotta focus!

01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:15.371
Ellen, what did you
do with Tina's shoes?

01:08:15.395 --> 01:08:16.676
I gave them to Tina.

01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:18.505
You did?

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:19.941
Ellen!

01:08:19.965 --> 01:08:21.856
The Bride should not be
worrying about her shoes!

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:25.163
You are the maid of honor.

01:08:25.188 --> 01:08:27.035
Never mind, I found them.

01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:30.560
Demote me, okay?

01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:31.996
No Tina!

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.475
You are not doing business
on your wedding day.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.825
It s a lawyer, I have to answer.

01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:36.871
Will you get my makeup
from the bathroom, please?

01:08:36.895 --> 01:08:38.026
Hi, Jim.

01:08:40.725 --> 01:08:43.660
Oh my gosh, really?

01:08:43.684 --> 01:08:45.009
That's the greatest news ever!

01:08:45.033 --> 01:08:47.011
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

01:08:47.035 --> 01:08:48.796
Best wedding present
of all time.

01:08:48.819 --> 01:08:49.840
Have a good one.

01:08:49.863 --> 01:08:53.017
Okay, I'll be in touch. Bye.

01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:55.019
They found the person who
stole Kristen s identity.

01:08:55.042 --> 01:08:57.196
Honey, that s great news.

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:59.154
Get this: her name
is Delilah Jenner

01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:01.287
and she's already in prison.

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:05.899
Wait, but how can she steal
your identity if she s in jail?

01:09:05.924 --> 01:09:07.249
I don't know.

01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:09.207
Or send a threatening
email from a coffee shop?

01:09:09.232 --> 01:09:10.557
I don't know, I'll have to ask

01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:12.471
the cyber guy,
after the wedding.

01:09:12.496 --> 01:09:16.301
Unless she partnered with
somebody on the outside?

01:09:16.326 --> 01:09:18.608
Come on girls, we have to focus.

01:09:18.631 --> 01:09:20.567
We re not going to
make it to the salon.

01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:23.961
You know what? You
guys go on without me.

01:09:23.984 --> 01:09:27.051
I forgot to get Tina
something borrowed.

01:09:27.075 --> 01:09:29.228
You realize this now?

01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:33.057
Your appointment
is in 30 minutes!

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.755
Go ahead and cancel it.

01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:36.974
I ll go with Au
Naturale Beach Waves.

01:09:36.997 --> 01:09:38.323
Once again...

01:09:38.348 --> 01:09:39.934
Hey, is everything okay?

01:09:39.957 --> 01:09:41.327
Everything's totally fine.

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:43.067
I'll meet you guys at the venue.

01:09:43.091 --> 01:09:45.050
Okay, come on Mom.

01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:55.191
I'm not demoting
her, I m firing her!

01:10:04.809 --> 01:10:07.135
Second degree grand larceny.

01:10:07.159 --> 01:10:10.356
Assault with a deadly weapon.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.946
Carjacking?

01:10:13.774 --> 01:10:15.665
That s downright thuggery.

01:10:15.689 --> 01:10:20.128
You are supposed to be a much
more sophisticated hacker.

01:10:21.782 --> 01:10:24.805
Whoa...

01:10:24.829 --> 01:10:27.005
That's weird.

01:10:34.926 --> 01:10:37.426
Hi, it s Ellen.

01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:40.734
I m out of the office and I
can t get on the server.

01:10:40.758 --> 01:10:42.910
Is there any way that
you can check name

01:10:42.934 --> 01:10:46.870
of the attorney that
represented a Delilah Jenner?

01:10:46.894 --> 01:10:49.723
March 23, 2014.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:54.269
Holy...

01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:56.097
No, that s exactly
what I needed.

01:10:56.121 --> 01:10:57.818
Thank you so much.

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:11.808
Hello, this is Joyce.

01:11:11.832 --> 01:11:14.724
Hi, Joyce. Big day huh?

01:11:14.748 --> 01:11:17.292
Oh, hello Ellen. Yes, it is.

01:11:17.316 --> 01:11:19.338
I've got a little
something I was wanting

01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:21.340
to give Harper
after the ceremony

01:11:21.364 --> 01:11:23.690
and I could really
use your input.

01:11:23.714 --> 01:11:26.693
Is there any way you could stop
by my apartment right now?

01:11:26.717 --> 01:11:29.173
My mom and my sister
are at the salon.

01:11:29.197 --> 01:11:31.263
Can't this wait till
after the wedding?

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:32.873
Please!

01:11:32.897 --> 01:11:35.136
We can t talk this
anywhere near my Mom,

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.641
because she's gonna want
to put her two cents in.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.209
You re the only one who
really knows Harper.

01:11:44.387 --> 01:11:46.539
Well, I m still getting ready

01:11:46.563 --> 01:11:48.541
but I ll be over
as soon as I can.

01:11:48.565 --> 01:11:49.890
Great!

01:11:49.914 --> 01:11:51.655
Thanks, Joyce.

01:11:56.877 --> 01:11:58.202
Do you think Ellen's here?

01:11:58.226 --> 01:12:00.204
I didn't see her car outside.

01:12:00.228 --> 01:12:02.816
Tina, let's stop
worrying about that.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.558
The photographer is here and
we're way behind schedule.

01:12:05.582 --> 01:12:08.324
Now get up those stairs, move!

01:12:13.067 --> 01:12:14.262
Thank you for stopping by.

01:12:14.286 --> 01:12:16.177
Come in!

01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:17.787
May I offer you a glass of wine?

01:12:17.811 --> 01:12:19.833
Don t we have to be
at pictures soon?

01:12:19.857 --> 01:12:21.574
We've got a few minutes.

01:12:21.598 --> 01:12:22.879
I m in a celebratory mood.

01:12:22.903 --> 01:12:24.620
What do you say?

01:12:24.644 --> 01:12:26.559
Not for me, but feel free.

01:12:36.656 --> 01:12:39.243
Lovely view.

01:12:39.267 --> 01:12:41.985
Can t complain.

01:12:42.009 --> 01:12:46.599
So what s this special
surprise you have for Harper?

01:12:46.623 --> 01:12:49.428
Before we get to
that, I was curious.

01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:52.909
Did you ever have a chance to
talk to anyone at Duane's firm?

01:12:52.933 --> 01:12:56.870
You know, about
representing Tina?

01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:59.742
Considering everything that's
going on, it's been hard.

01:12:59.766 --> 01:13:02.919
Of course, I figured.

01:13:02.943 --> 01:13:05.748
I discovered that there was a
conflict of interest, anyway.

01:13:05.772 --> 01:13:08.925
As it turns out, Duane
represented the felon

01:13:08.949 --> 01:13:11.363
that set up Tina and made
it look like she had

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:14.453
stolen her business
partner s identity.

01:13:14.477 --> 01:13:15.889
I have no idea what
you re talking about.

01:13:15.913 --> 01:13:21.111
A felon who also
happens to be in jail.

01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:25.638
Though I guess if there was
access to the felon s files,

01:13:25.662 --> 01:13:29.250
all of the information that you'd
need would be right there.

01:13:29.274 --> 01:13:30.382
I wouldn t know.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.209
I don t know anything
about computers.

01:13:32.233 --> 01:13:34.255
Right.

01:13:34.279 --> 01:13:37.301
But do you know who
probably would know though?

01:13:37.325 --> 01:13:38.868
Duane.

01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:43.830
Oh wait. He s dead, isn t he?

01:13:43.854 --> 01:13:46.963
You took care of
that, didn t you?

01:13:46.987 --> 01:13:49.879
You got rid of all of his pills.

01:13:49.903 --> 01:13:52.882
You are a vicious, ugly person,

01:13:52.906 --> 01:13:54.580
and I don t have to stand here

01:13:54.604 --> 01:13:56.495
and subject myself to
your horrible lies.

01:13:56.519 --> 01:13:59.454
You have made my sister
s life a living hell.

01:13:59.478 --> 01:14:02.457
And as hard as you
have tried to ruin

01:14:02.481 --> 01:14:04.807
her relationship with
Brock, you failed.

01:14:04.831 --> 01:14:08.028
They re getting married and
you re stuck with that.

01:14:08.052 --> 01:14:09.725
So here s what you
re going to do.

01:14:09.749 --> 01:14:11.988
Admit to Tina that
you set her up

01:14:12.012 --> 01:14:14.643
and you ll have a
shot at maintaining

01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:16.906
a relationship with
Harper and Brock.

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:19.039
Otherwise, I ll keep digging.

01:14:19.063 --> 01:14:22.129
And maybe I can t prove right
now that you were involved,

01:14:22.153 --> 01:14:25.611
but I promise you that I will.

01:14:25.635 --> 01:14:27.506
Up to you, Joyce.

01:14:43.566 --> 01:14:47.918
You have no idea
what it s been like.

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:54.422
Losing my daughter.

01:14:54.446 --> 01:14:59.383
Watching while everyone else's
lives go on without her.

01:14:59.407 --> 01:15:01.235
My baby!

01:15:02.759 --> 01:15:04.195
My everything!

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:08.242
I need help.

01:15:09.417 --> 01:15:12.092
You do...

01:15:12.116 --> 01:15:13.876
Do you think you can help me?

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.661
Please, Ellen, please!

01:15:15.685 --> 01:15:17.184
Do you think you can help me?
Please!

01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:18.688
Yes.

01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:22.145
Thank you.

01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:45.584
Still no answer, this
is getting ridiculous.

01:16:41.292 --> 01:16:43.642
Oh my God, what happened?

01:17:24.074 --> 01:17:25.442
Excuse me.

01:17:25.466 --> 01:17:26.922
Special request from the bride.

01:17:26.946 --> 01:17:28.663
Would you mind
bringing it to her?

01:17:28.687 --> 01:17:31.385
I have to assist
an elderly guest.

01:17:37.783 --> 01:17:38.828
Ellen!

01:17:40.612 --> 01:17:43.069
Sorry, I thought you
were my sister.

01:17:43.093 --> 01:17:43.939
Oh, perfect.

01:17:43.963 --> 01:17:45.158
That's exactly what I needed.

01:17:45.182 --> 01:17:47.203
Absolutely not!

01:17:47.227 --> 01:17:48.814
The first champagne
on your wedding day

01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:50.840
should be with your groom.

01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:54.689
Could you please take
this downstairs?

01:17:54.713 --> 01:17:55.888
Thank you.

01:18:07.595 --> 01:18:12.315
Joyce, the server is
bringing you a champagne.

01:18:12.339 --> 01:18:14.777
Looks like you could use it.

01:19:17.404 --> 01:19:19.426
Nothing?

01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:22.734
She hasn t even
checked her messages.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.977
I m sure there s an explanation.

01:19:27.937 --> 01:19:32.115
Mom, I can t get
married without her.

01:19:35.205 --> 01:19:38.706
Well then...

01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:41.298
Everyone will just have to wait.

01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:45.345
I ll go tell the staff.

01:19:47.652 --> 01:19:49.175
Thanks.

01:20:31.174 --> 01:20:33.674
Is Ellen here? Has she come yet?

01:20:33.698 --> 01:20:34.893
No, I haven't seen her.

01:20:34.917 --> 01:20:36.851
This is not like her.

01:20:36.875 --> 01:20:38.897
Not answering her phone.

01:20:38.921 --> 01:20:40.942
Maybe was an accident?

01:20:40.966 --> 01:20:42.161
Give me a second.

01:20:42.185 --> 01:20:44.578
Let me call the hospital, okay?

01:20:47.538 --> 01:20:49.603
Petra?

01:20:49.627 --> 01:20:51.823
Could you take Harper please?

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:56.001
Hey Maria, this is Dr. Nichols.

01:20:56.025 --> 01:20:58.830
Can you do me a favor
and let me know

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:01.354
if Ellen Williams
was admitted today?

01:21:01.378 --> 01:21:03.704
Thanks.

01:21:03.728 --> 01:21:06.141
She was?

01:21:06.165 --> 01:21:08.622
Can you put me on
with Dr. Sanders?

01:21:08.646 --> 01:21:09.646
Great.

01:21:25.315 --> 01:21:26.707
Ellen?

01:21:28.971 --> 01:21:31.103
You have her phone,
where is she?

01:21:33.323 --> 01:21:34.996
What did you do?

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.848
You left me no choice!

01:21:43.594 --> 01:21:45.528
You had to be in
control, don't you?

01:21:45.552 --> 01:21:47.095
That s how it was with Lorna.

01:21:47.119 --> 01:21:49.426
You have no idea what
you re talking about!

01:21:50.731 --> 01:21:52.603
She couldn t stand it either!

01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:56.583
Hey Steve, it's Dr. Nichols.

01:21:56.607 --> 01:21:59.566
Can you give me an update
on an Ellen Williams?

01:22:05.398 --> 01:22:06.965
Tell me.

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:35.820
I love Harper and I
could've loved you too.

01:22:40.172 --> 01:22:43.021
Mom!

01:22:43.045 --> 01:22:45.719
I think she did
something to Ellen.

01:22:45.743 --> 01:22:49.244
Sweetheart, she's gonna be okay.

01:22:49.268 --> 01:22:51.705
Ellen's gonna be okay.

01:23:03.456 --> 01:23:04.477
Congratulations!

01:23:04.501 --> 01:23:05.521
Thanks, Judge.

01:23:05.545 --> 01:23:07.567
We couldn t be happier.

01:23:07.591 --> 01:23:09.332
Right there!

01:23:10.724 --> 01:23:12.572
That s a perfect picture.

01:23:12.596 --> 01:23:14.052
Tina, you have to do it now!

01:23:14.076 --> 01:23:15.381
Okay.

01:23:20.125 --> 01:23:22.016
Ellen s the next bride!

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.713
Okay, I did not catch that!

01:23:23.737 --> 01:23:24.845
It hit you on the head.

01:23:24.869 --> 01:23:25.889
That still counts!

01:23:25.913 --> 01:23:27.369
No!

01:23:27.393 --> 01:23:29.473
Looks like I'm gonna be
buying another wedding dress!

01:23:30.744 --> 01:23:32.070
So, who s up for some brunch?

01:23:32.094 --> 01:23:33.419
Let s get pancakes!

01:23:33.443 --> 01:23:35.551
I could definitely go
for some pancakes.

01:23:35.575 --> 01:23:37.553
With strawberries!

01:23:37.577 --> 01:23:39.188
And whipped cream...

01:23:42.713 --> 01:23:45.542
Nona loves blueberries
on her pancakes...

01:23:47.239 --> 01:23:50.025
Nona gets plenty of
blueberries at her new home.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.115
Come on, let's go.

01:23:58.294 --> 01:23:59.338
Well, I'm hungry.

01:24:02.515 --> 01:24:05.103
I love my daughter,
she is brilliant!

01:24:05.127 --> 01:24:07.192
She'll come by soon.

01:24:07.216 --> 01:24:08.410
She s one of the
youngest lawyers

01:24:08.434 --> 01:24:10.847
to make partner at the firm.

01:24:10.871 --> 01:24:13.894
Did I ever mention
that to you before?

01:24:13.918 --> 01:24:15.765
A few times.

01:24:15.789 --> 01:24:18.227
Let s get you back to bed, okay Mrs.
Miller?

01:24:19.967 --> 01:24:21.380
Of course.

01:24:21.404 --> 01:24:23.904
I always made sure she
had a substantial lunch.

01:24:23.928 --> 01:24:25.949
None of that school
cafeteria garage

01:24:25.973 --> 01:24:28.150
that they fed the poor children.

01:24:29.586 --> 01:24:31.346
You don t even know
what s in it...

01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:33.218
It could be rat poison.

01:24:33.242 --> 01:24:34.871
It could be crushed glass.

01:24:34.895 --> 01:24:36.506
You don't know...

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:43.253
