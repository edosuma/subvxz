WEBVTT

00:39.623 --> 00:41.410
I'll trade my salt pork tonight
for another watch

00:41.500 --> 00:43.537
if we don't see it.

00:43.627 --> 00:47.211
Henry Lloyd saw it by
those hummocks at four bells.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.165
What told him it was Lieutenant Gore's
bear and not another?

00:50.259 --> 00:52.592
It wore
the Lieutenant's medals.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.761
I plan to ask Lieutenant
Le Vesconte for duty

00:54.846 --> 00:57.054
in the hunting blind
once it's built.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.881
I'd like another shot
at the thing.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.968
Robert Ferrier says
you didn't see it at all.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.848
Only Mr. Goodsir saw it.

01:02.938 --> 01:05.180
That Mary Anne
doesn't know what he saw.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.318
We thought it was the bear
in front of us.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.941
It's the ice, Georgie.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.909
It's only the ice.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.534
What's it like,
to shoot a man?

01:21.623 --> 01:24.206
Shooting a man's more fun
when you mean to do it.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.285
I'll tell you that.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.792
You've a gift
with that.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.672
Me mam
was a dressmaker.

01:35.762 --> 01:39.005
Cage crinoline and
arse-torn knicker-bocker suits.

01:39.099 --> 01:44.094
But she never taught me
to tailor for no dead Eskimuck.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.439
This all of it, then?

01:56.533 --> 01:57.990
The girl, she's shoving off.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.318
They want her to take
everything with her.

02:00.412 --> 02:03.450
A girl on a boat... here.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.951
That's spooky.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.377
Call him back.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.460
There's something more in here.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.011
Snip it out.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.479
Check for more.
Suppose it's ivory.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.396
There's another one here.

02:37.407 --> 02:40.275
Man's got charms falling
off him like a plum tree,

02:40.369 --> 02:42.577
Mr. Goodsir.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.535
Put them back inside.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.830
How will he fit
in his coffin like that?

03:07.979 --> 03:09.515
I have the, um...

03:09.606 --> 03:12.519
Her father's personals, sir.

03:17.823 --> 03:20.190
She'll be happy
to be on her way now.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.747
They say she talked up a storm
until her father died.

03:35.006 --> 03:37.874
Now she's all silence.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.425
I'm sorry,

03:39.511 --> 03:43.630
that... that's all there is.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.468
I did put some supper
in there for you, though.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.984
Condolences, Lady Silence.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.752
Weight him
and get on with it.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.260
I don't understand this.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.090
This is something
Sir John approved?

04:28.185 --> 04:31.098
Aye, Mr. Goodsir.
Little lad, he was.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.429
He shouldn't plug it up.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.605
I mean to suggest,
might it be more appropriate

04:34.691 --> 04:36.432
to cut the man his own hole?

04:36.526 --> 04:38.267
A more appropriate hole?

04:38.361 --> 04:40.603
With respect to
Esquimaux custom.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.074
It's a native belief
the body retains sensation

04:45.160 --> 04:46.867
even after the soul departs.

04:46.953 --> 04:50.287
According to
Dr. MacDonald's account.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.783
Having yourself
handled his corpse,

04:53.877 --> 04:56.039
is it your opinion
he retains sensation?

06:09.828 --> 06:12.696
In your prior engagements
with the Esquimaux,

06:12.789 --> 06:15.497
did you find them at all...
unforgiving...

06:15.584 --> 06:17.576
when those they loved
are wronged?

06:18.295 --> 06:20.753
Vengeful, even?

06:20.839 --> 06:24.708
Having never wronged them,
I couldn't testify.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.168
Are we not at all concerned
that if that girl can...

06:27.262 --> 06:29.595
make it all the way back
to her people on her own,

06:29.681 --> 06:31.718
she may call on them
for revenge?

06:31.808 --> 06:34.767
Were we to put her
down the fire hole as well?

06:34.853 --> 06:36.389
She wasn't our prisoner,
Edward.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.438
The Esquimaux man's tongue
was hacked off.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.265
We don't know why.
Say it was punishment.

06:41.359 --> 06:44.397
If that's how they punish one of
their own, then what must they do to...

06:44.487 --> 06:46.228
Breakfast is ready.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.986
Jopson, my coat.
I'm leaving for <i>Erebus.</i>

06:49.868 --> 06:51.325
No escort is necessary.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.573
You have nothing to fear,
Lieutenant.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.371
The girl's people are far too busy
staying alive to wage a war.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.788
What plans have you made,
Sir John?

07:38.875 --> 07:41.037
All kinds of plans, of course.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.210
In case the ships
are ice-locked.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.915
Oh, we are amply provisioned,
for three years,

07:47.008 --> 07:49.295
and up to five
with strict rationing.

07:49.386 --> 07:53.130
Your rescue plan.
What is your rescue plan?

07:54.224 --> 07:57.183
Better John Ross
blame an unyielding North

07:57.268 --> 08:00.511
than own up
to his poor captaining.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.598
If the Arctic bedeviled him,
why should it open to you?

08:03.692 --> 08:05.433
That's his thinking.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.194
Come over here, darling.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.613
What is it?

08:11.700 --> 08:13.862
- Does it sing?
- It chatters.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.909
Meet... Jacko.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.204
Mm.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.750
Oh...

08:23.837 --> 08:26.420
Darling, that monkey is female.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.338
Oh, is it?

08:28.425 --> 08:31.918
I have followed
every Admiralty protocol.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.429
There'll be nothing.
You hear?

08:36.433 --> 08:40.017
Nothing lives there.
Nothing grows.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.642
You'll eat your shoes again.
You'll eat worse.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.691
We've been misunderstood,
darling.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.063
John Ross isn't the only one.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.363
Van Diemen's Land
was a horrible blow.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.362
I won't allow another man
to play politics against me

08:55.452 --> 08:56.943
ever again.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.365
I was a good Governor, Janey.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.869
You were an excellent Governor.

09:01.958 --> 09:05.417
It's just that history
was given a different story.

09:05.503 --> 09:08.712
Death is slow
in the Great White Nothing.

09:08.798 --> 09:13.133
And 134 starved men
will turn devil against you.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.883
Starting with the ones
you hold closest.

09:16.973 --> 09:20.262
But in two years, when you
return from the Passage,

09:20.351 --> 09:22.764
no-one will misunderstand us,
John.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.896
You will have bested them all.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.406
I'll be giving a Divine Service
tomorrow.

09:35.492 --> 09:39.236
Mandatory, for both ships.
Tell the men, will you?

09:41.206 --> 09:43.698
Oh, except for
the men of the blind.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.702
They're to keep their focus
on hunting the bear.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.599
May I come in, sir?

10:01.684 --> 10:04.643
I wouldn't presume to ask
if it weren't important.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.356
If you must.

10:33.216 --> 10:36.300
And in Jacob's dream,
he saw the invisible world,

10:36.386 --> 10:38.298
so immense it would have to...

10:40.974 --> 10:42.055
Yes?

10:42.142 --> 10:46.136
...cleaved from the frame
that carried them, yet live.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.972
The newest to their ranks,
our bright brother...

10:50.150 --> 10:52.483
...Lieutenant Graham Gore.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.731
My condolences, Sir John.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.985
Amongst everything else,
I know you mourn a friend.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.400
Thank you.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.487
I apologize for the timing
of this request.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.164
But its virtue's in its speed.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.253
I'd like permission
to send a sledge party out.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.964
South. Not for leads this time.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.508
For rescue.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.178
Where?

11:21.264 --> 11:24.348
The Hudson Bay Company outpost
on Great Slave Lake.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.350
If the party leaves now,
they'll have

11:27.437 --> 11:30.851
three full months to get there
before winter comes in force.

11:31.608 --> 11:35.147
That is 800 miles, Francis.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.102
No...

11:37.947 --> 11:39.984
...I do not grant permission.

11:45.830 --> 11:49.039
At least tell me you understand
why I'm suggesting it.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.495
You are suggesting it
because you are a man

11:54.589 --> 11:57.206
who's happiest with a glass
of knock-me-down in one hand

11:57.300 --> 11:59.462
and an alarm bell in the other.

12:06.809 --> 12:11.144
I'm suggesting it because...
if this cold continues

12:11.231 --> 12:12.597
and we find ourselves

12:12.690 --> 12:14.932
overwintering again
in this ice,

12:15.026 --> 12:17.894
help must already be
on its way, come spring...

12:17.987 --> 12:19.774
if we are to survive.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.277
I'd rather send out
eight men now,

12:22.367 --> 12:24.575
for a long, unnecessary walk,

12:24.661 --> 12:28.280
than risk a necessary one
for all of us in a year.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.122
I will not allow it.

12:31.209 --> 12:34.418
What signal
would that send to the men?

12:34.504 --> 12:37.838
It's not the men
I'm concerned about signaling.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.416
No one knows where we are.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.342
That is how you already see us?

12:42.428 --> 12:44.420
In need of saving?

12:44.514 --> 12:48.258
- I do.
- Yet your prediction last year

12:48.351 --> 12:50.764
about the terrifying winter
we'd spend in the pack

12:50.853 --> 12:52.139
did not come true.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.938
Not to the degree I feared,
but that will change,

12:55.024 --> 12:57.357
should there again be no thaw.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.568
It is a Captain's duty,
after all,

13:00.655 --> 13:03.147
to mind for the worst case,
not for the one he hopes for.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.824
Oh, so, now I must hear you

13:05.910 --> 13:08.323
instruct me
in a Captain's duties.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.328
It's only eight men, Sir John.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.378
And there is just enough time.

13:25.221 --> 13:29.682
I have lost six men
on this expedition to date.

13:29.767 --> 13:34.307
Six! And you ask me to risk
more than doubling that number

13:34.397 --> 13:36.138
trekking over distant ground

13:36.232 --> 13:38.815
where you know I have lost men
in years past.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.358
I'll hear no more of this.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.812
I will not lose another man,
Francis.

13:42.905 --> 13:46.319
We may lose all our men.

13:46.409 --> 13:49.493
That is what my alarm
is ringing now, Sir John.

13:49.579 --> 13:52.663
And I... I am at a loss
why yours is not.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.379
You are the worst kind
of second, Francis.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.630
You abuse your freedoms.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.054
You complain in the safety
of speculation,

14:09.140 --> 14:12.508
you claim foresight in
disasters that never happen,

14:12.602 --> 14:14.343
and you are weak in your vices

14:14.437 --> 14:18.477
because your rank affords you
privacy and deference.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.687
You've made yourself miserable

14:21.778 --> 14:23.440
and distant, and hard to love,

14:23.529 --> 14:25.612
and you blame the world for it.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.984
I'm not the sailor you are,
Francis, never will be.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.944
But you will never be
fit for command.

14:32.997 --> 14:37.367
And, as your Captain, I take
some responsibility for that.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.244
For the vanity of your outlook.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.125
I should have curbed
these tendencies,

14:42.215 --> 14:44.582
rather than sympathized
with them, because you seem

14:44.675 --> 14:47.463
to have confused my sympathy
with tolerance,

14:47.553 --> 14:50.011
but there is a limit
to how much I can tolerate,

14:50.098 --> 14:53.887
and that is where we are
presently standing!

14:58.648 --> 15:00.731
There are some things
we were never meant to be

15:00.817 --> 15:03.275
to one another.
I see that now.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.354
Friends... on my side.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.733
Relations on yours.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.740
So let us turn our energies
back to being

15:13.830 --> 15:17.039
what the Admiralty, and life,
have seen fit to make us.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.458
We should give that our best.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.831
There can be no argument
between us there.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.047
Now you must excuse me.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.093
I have a service
to finish writing for tomorrow.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.511
It will have to act
as the only eulogy

15:31.597 --> 15:34.135
our boy Graham
will be given out here...

15:35.268 --> 15:37.351
...and I intend it to sing.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.186
Put together a list.
Our eight most able men.

16:26.194 --> 16:30.484
- Sir John heard reason, then?
- I'll make certain

16:30.573 --> 16:33.486
the blame falls on no one's
shoulders but my own.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.909
Proceeding with this
would be considered...

16:35.995 --> 16:39.909
It would take weeks to engineer
some way to change his mind.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.662
We don't have weeks.
We may not even have days.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.835
Lieutenant Little
will never agree to it.

16:44.921 --> 16:48.005
He won't have to.
I'll lead the party myself.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.834
With my presence,
the other members of the team

16:51.928 --> 16:53.669
can say they were coerced.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.597
I'll tell them
it's a hunting party at first.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.799
The act won't impugn them.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.180
And if we were to meet
Esquimaux along the way,

17:01.270 --> 17:04.354
I can converse our needs
and gain help in that manner.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.181
Then send me in your place.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.141
I can speak native
as well as you.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.521
You must stay.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.355
To read the ice
if leads open up.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.690
And as for Dr. MacDonald...

17:14.784 --> 17:17.026
I'll not take a doctor
from the men.

17:17.118 --> 17:19.031
But you're the Captain.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.618
There's a spare Captain
on <i>Erebus.</i>

17:24.919 --> 17:27.127
You'll be despised.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.876
Sir John will have your head.

17:29.966 --> 17:33.585
And if he doesn't call for it,
the Admiralty certainly will.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.544
They can have it.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.130
After I build us
a road out of here.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.307
And what of the <i>Terror?</i>

17:42.478 --> 17:44.094
Make me that list, Thomas.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.555
I plan to leave at
start of last watch.

18:00.538 --> 18:03.281
Write it down this time,
Mr. Diggle.

18:03.374 --> 18:06.742
In order to heat your soup,
you must first heat the stove.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.327
Thank you for sharing
the extent of

18:08.421 --> 18:10.083
your knowledge as a cook,
Mr. Wall.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.289
But I'd never hazard
the wreck of your kitchen

18:12.383 --> 18:14.466
unless pressed
by dire consequence.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.544
"Dire consequence"?

18:16.637 --> 18:19.095
But there's much here
for you to marvel at.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.672
Just look how happy my men are.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.302
Oh, I marvel.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.635
But about something more
intriguing than you.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.766
What on earth are you up to?

18:28.232 --> 18:31.316
I'm concerned about the number
of <i>Terror'</i> s canned provisions

18:31.402 --> 18:32.984
turning up spoilt.

18:33.070 --> 18:36.108
I'm here to inquire
if <i>Erebus</i> is seeing the same.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.906
I've discovered bad seals,
gray meat

18:38.993 --> 18:41.030
and odors that curled my hair.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.578
Now, in the event
you've already developed

18:43.664 --> 18:45.451
a method for handling
the problem,

18:45.541 --> 18:48.454
I hope you can set aside
your envy and share it.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.036
Otherwise I thought we might
together invent a solution.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.871
Mm.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.209
Add salt.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.485
Men approaching.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.407
At ease.

19:25.790 --> 19:29.079
We thought you might be
in need of a short,

19:29.168 --> 19:31.034
gentlemen, to keep warm.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.495
That's a generous,
generous thought, sir.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.046
Ha.

19:35.132 --> 19:38.421
- What bait are we using?
- Rats, sir.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.003
We pulled the biggest of
the bunch up from the holds,

19:41.097 --> 19:43.009
gutted them
and tied them up on lines.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.308
You'll put our Fagin
out of a job. Although...

19:47.186 --> 19:48.893
...that layabout
couldn't catch a rat

19:48.979 --> 19:50.686
if it fell asleep in its mouth.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.857
He was meant to be a lapdog,
not a cat.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.561
Or maybe... a small pillow.

20:11.961 --> 20:15.454
Lieutenant Irving.
I was hoping we'd meet.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.206
Mind the grease there, sir.

20:19.301 --> 20:22.715
I wanted to thank you...
for your help.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.922
For your discretion, I mean.

20:25.015 --> 20:28.725
Call it anything but "help,"
Mr. Hickey. Please.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.559
I exercised clemency

20:32.648 --> 20:35.106
for a man abused
by a devious seducer.

20:35.818 --> 20:39.061
That it also benefited you
is a sin in itself, I'm sure.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.363
- A "devious seducer"?
- Yes, Mr. Hickey.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.241
Mr. Gibson told me everything.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.785
How you pressed him
into service,

20:47.872 --> 20:50.364
threatened to expose him
should he ever refuse you.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.370
I pressed him?

20:54.170 --> 20:55.581
You laugh?

20:56.380 --> 20:59.123
Turn your wolf's ear to me now
and hear...

20:59.216 --> 21:01.799
or the next piece of counsel
you'll be given on the subject

21:01.886 --> 21:04.128
may come from
the end of a cat o' nines.

21:06.849 --> 21:10.433
We are... separated here

21:10.519 --> 21:12.761
from the temptations
of the world.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.764
At sea,

21:15.858 --> 21:18.851
a man can find spiritual
benefit in the collective.

21:20.154 --> 21:22.862
It is no accident the world
was reborn clean out of an ark,

21:22.948 --> 21:24.439
Mr. Hickey.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.274
Man's worst urges
can be satisfied

21:26.368 --> 21:28.735
through Christian pleasures
and graces...

21:28.829 --> 21:32.618
singing with friends...
watercolors, study,

21:32.708 --> 21:35.200
- climbing exercises.
- Climbing, sir?

21:35.294 --> 21:38.628
Your crisis is an opportunity
for you to repair yourself.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.207
You are in
the world's best place for it.

21:43.886 --> 21:46.128
Do you think so?

21:46.222 --> 21:49.431
God sees you, Mr. Hickey.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.053
Here more than anywhere.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.695
I understand you've cleared up
our association

22:10.788 --> 22:12.700
for Lieutenant Irving.

22:16.418 --> 22:19.331
- You spoke to him?
- Mm-hmm.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.128
Directly?

22:22.466 --> 22:24.332
Christ, Cornelius.
I'd reassured him.

22:24.426 --> 22:28.090
"Cornelius Hickey
is a devious seducer."

22:29.306 --> 22:32.925
That was your...
was your reassurance?

22:33.018 --> 22:35.305
You've got some face.
You know that?

22:38.148 --> 22:40.891
We were within an ace
of getting called out

22:40.985 --> 22:44.023
in front of all the men
and whipped for it, or worse.

22:44.113 --> 22:45.194
You were right.

22:45.281 --> 22:48.069
If he weren't such an
Anchorite, we would have been.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.525
So just keep your foot
out of it now, please,

22:50.619 --> 22:52.235
and let him forget
the whole thing,

22:52.329 --> 22:54.412
as he assuredly wants to.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.366
To think you were such a good
wife to me all these months.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.200
Oh, go to hell.

22:59.295 --> 23:00.752
We've had our beer
and skittles,

23:00.838 --> 23:02.750
but your tastes
are no rule for mine.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.706
- Hm. Oh, no?
- No.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.710
Is that why I've seen
more of your postern

23:07.803 --> 23:09.510
than your face this winter,
Billy?

23:09.597 --> 23:11.714
- Hm.
- Huh?

23:11.807 --> 23:14.675
Do you know what copulates
on this ship?

23:15.644 --> 23:20.230
Rats. Nesting in our rubbish,
swimming in our filth.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.308
Devouring each other
just to make more rats.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.484
Well, I am not a rat.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.022
I'm a man.

23:30.659 --> 23:34.073
A delightful, God-fearing man.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.989
I had to choose.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.574
No one is out here
for the view, Cornelius.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.534
My standing with command
is more valuable

23:41.629 --> 23:42.790
than my standing with you.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.917
I know you, of all people,
will understand that.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.795
Now, if this is what I need
to say, then I will say it.

23:49.303 --> 23:52.091
It's not personal,
but it is finished.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.219
So don't be pettish.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.768
I haven't done you down
as you so think.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.893
I've just made it so that
we can both keep our skins.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.861
Please.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.781
You've sketched out the ladder,

24:19.875 --> 24:22.959
but you've got me
on the wrong rung, Mr. Gibson.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.082
What does that mean?

24:26.215 --> 24:29.049
Captain Crozier
served me a drink,

24:29.134 --> 24:30.796
just the other day.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.966
Whiskey.

24:34.056 --> 24:37.766
In one of his...
cut glasses, in fact.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.310
He spoke to me as a friend.

24:43.357 --> 24:44.643
A friend?

24:44.733 --> 24:47.350
Yes.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.812
He sees something in me.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.820
- It could lead anywhere.
- Cornelius...

24:54.910 --> 24:57.152
- Anywhere.
- Cornelius, you...

24:59.123 --> 25:01.331
The Captain doesn't
see you at all.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.830
You can ask Mr. Jopson
or Mr. Genge,

25:03.919 --> 25:05.501
but they will tell you...

25:05.587 --> 25:07.499
he'll offer anyone a drink...

25:07.589 --> 25:09.706
if he can have one, too.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.870
Posterity awaits, Mr. Goodsir.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.997
Hold still! Not a twitch.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.666
Wonderful!

27:20.222 --> 27:22.179
In honor of our brother
Lieutenant Gore, be merciless.

27:22.266 --> 27:24.132
Educate this creature

27:24.226 --> 27:26.809
as to the dominion
of the Empire,

27:26.895 --> 27:28.852
and the will of the Lord behind it.

27:29.773 --> 27:30.854
- Sir?
- Yes?

27:30.941 --> 27:32.853
Why don't you sit with us?

27:32.943 --> 27:36.527
Perhaps it can be you who fires
the shot that convinces it.

27:36.613 --> 27:39.321
At least be here
to see it felled.

27:40.409 --> 27:43.493
Yes, I'll sit with you
for a moment. Thank you.

27:45.581 --> 27:48.369
You may return to the ship,
Mr. Goodsir.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.199
- Do you need a chaperone?
- Yes.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.579
Or you may stay with us.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.087
Yes, sir.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.523
Oh!

28:18.822 --> 28:20.609
Get back!

28:45.474 --> 28:48.012
They must be waltzing
with that bear after all.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.106
Fall back!

28:59.196 --> 29:00.812
Send our Marines!

29:00.906 --> 29:03.239
- Uh. Now!
- Sir.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.947
<i>Erebus!</i>

29:08.747 --> 29:11.239
<i>Erebus! Erebus!</i>

29:12.334 --> 29:13.996
Sir John!

29:14.086 --> 29:16.419
Des Voeux,
bring three men and follow me.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.212
Yes, sir. You.
The rest of you stay here.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.210
Sir John?

29:22.094 --> 29:23.676
Call out!

29:23.762 --> 29:25.674
<i>Erebus!</i>

29:52.582 --> 29:53.993
Aargh!

30:30.620 --> 30:32.862
Sir John!

30:43.925 --> 30:46.508
Sir John? Give me a line!

30:47.471 --> 30:50.384
Sir John. Sir John!

30:51.725 --> 30:53.808
Give me a line!

31:14.081 --> 31:17.415
Groups of six. Carry any
wounded back to the ships.

31:17.501 --> 31:20.118
Sweep the ice. I want
every man accounted for. Go.

31:24.091 --> 31:26.083
No!

32:10.679 --> 32:13.763
The Passage was
supposed to be his.

32:13.849 --> 32:15.932
How does it know
to take our best men?

32:16.017 --> 32:18.134
Lieutenant Gore.
And now the Captain.

32:18.228 --> 32:21.437
It took Bryant.
He weren't no "best" man.

32:21.523 --> 32:24.140
He was a ranking Marine.
He was a Sergeant.

32:24.234 --> 32:26.817
He were a red-coated conscript.

32:28.113 --> 32:30.696
That bear don't "know" us.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.991
It knows one thing
and one thing only.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.781
You don't think it strange...
it should start killing us

32:39.875 --> 32:41.867
right after
we took down that Eski?

32:42.878 --> 32:47.964
He did have a... a carved bear
in his robe, the Esquimaux.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.542
A little token or such.

32:53.054 --> 32:55.637
- And one of a man.
- Where are they now?

32:55.724 --> 32:57.431
We put them back.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.554
Ain't no way
we were taking them.

34:02.165 --> 34:04.282
Go on, John.

35:22.037 --> 35:24.950
I never wanted anything
as little as I want this now.

35:29.002 --> 35:31.619
I do have an order.

35:31.713 --> 35:36.048
Mr. Blanky, proceed immediately
with the rescue party.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.468
Lieutenant Fairholme
can lead it. Let him know.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.513
Sir John forbade this plan.

35:42.599 --> 35:45.012
Swap two Marines
into the party...

35:45.101 --> 35:48.390
and lighten the load what
amount you feel you safely can.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.472
They'll need every advantage.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.807
I implore you. Please, stop.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.358
We have lost Sir John!

35:56.613 --> 35:58.855
We have lost Sir John.

35:59.824 --> 36:02.567
Do you not... Do you not feel
what has happened?

36:07.165 --> 36:08.781
I feel it.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.500
One day.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.999
I am asking one day...

36:14.089 --> 36:17.002
to allow our men to grieve.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.301
And then they go.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.595
These words are not mine.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.381
They're Sir John's.

37:08.435 --> 37:10.722
He wanted you to hear them.

37:10.812 --> 37:14.601
And, lacking words of my own...

37:15.859 --> 37:17.566
..I give you his.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.940
His last.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.065
"In his flight,

37:24.159 --> 37:26.572
Jacob lighted upon
a certain place

37:26.661 --> 37:29.244
and tarried there becau...

37:29.330 --> 37:31.822
because the sun was set.

37:33.835 --> 37:36.168
He thought it
a terrible place.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.831
No house, no hearth.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.837
But that night he dreamed:

37:43.845 --> 37:45.711
A ladder set upon the earth

37:45.805 --> 37:48.923
and the top of it
reaching to the heavens.

37:49.017 --> 37:53.387
Behold, the Lord
stood above it and He said,

37:53.480 --> 37:55.722
'I am with thee,

37:55.815 --> 37:57.602
and will keep thee
in all places,

37:57.692 --> 38:00.605
wherever thou goest;

38:00.695 --> 38:03.028
for I will not leave thee.'

38:04.491 --> 38:07.950
And in Jacob's dream,
he saw the invisible world,

38:08.036 --> 38:11.154
companion to the known one
we perceive...

38:12.207 --> 38:14.244
...with its rocks and moon...

38:15.502 --> 38:18.415
...its ice fields
and brute animals...

38:19.547 --> 38:22.506
...and all the people we know...

38:23.718 --> 38:25.960
...have ever known...

38:26.054 --> 38:28.137
and will ever know.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.474
So complete
it would seem to leave no room

38:32.560 --> 38:34.802
for its invisible
brother world..."

38:34.896 --> 38:36.512
I'll be a minute on the seat.

38:36.606 --> 38:38.689
"...which is
yet more immense...

38:38.775 --> 38:41.267
...than the one we see.

38:42.654 --> 38:46.318
For in this world dwell
the Angels who keep us,

38:47.408 --> 38:49.900
the Lord
who will not leave us...

38:49.994 --> 38:52.486
and the departed,

38:52.580 --> 38:55.197
who though cleaved from
the frame that carried them,

38:55.291 --> 38:56.873
yet live.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.667
Newest to their ranks,

38:58.753 --> 39:01.996
our bright Captain...

39:02.090 --> 39:03.922
Sir John.

39:06.135 --> 39:09.128
Who, in the virtue and strength
of his every gesture,

39:09.222 --> 39:12.010
showed himself
the elect of the Lord...

39:13.142 --> 39:15.976
...destined to reign
with Christ forever.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.899
The invisible world of spirits,
though unseen,

39:21.985 --> 39:24.227
was present for Jacob.

39:26.698 --> 39:31.944
Not future, not distant,
but present.

39:35.123 --> 39:38.616
And it is now, and it is here,

39:38.710 --> 39:42.249
among us,
if we open our eyes...

39:43.965 --> 39:48.926
...and see His truth...
amongst us."

39:55.977 --> 39:58.219
Marines...

39:58.313 --> 40:00.475
ready!

40:01.816 --> 40:04.399
Present!

40:07.530 --> 40:10.147
Shoulder... arms!
