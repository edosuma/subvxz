21:01.301 --> 21:02.844
- I can't believe
the three of you

21:02.928 --> 21:04.680
took on the whole football team.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.348
- Four of us.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.224
- Yeah.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.684
Del Figgalo helped, sort of.

21:08.767 --> 21:09.726
- Mark?

21:09.810 --> 21:10.769

21:10.852 --> 21:13.146

STACEY: Zoey?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.251
Zoey!

21:36.712 --> 21:37.754
- Hey, Stacey.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.423
- You have to order more Moon
Bars.

21:39.506 --> 21:40.924
- Huh?
- The vending machine is out.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.384
There's one stuck in there,

21:42.467 --> 21:45.178
and a bunch of kids are trying
to break inside to get at it.

21:46.638 --> 21:47.556
DEAN RIVERS: Zoey!

21:47.639 --> 21:49.266
Zoey!

21:49.349 --> 21:50.767
We need more Moon Bars.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.060
They're all gone.
- Oh, there's one left.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.062
It's stuck in the machine.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.940
- Stuck in the--

21:57.024 --> 21:58.275
- [yelps]

21:58.358 --> 21:58.775
- What's going on?

21:58.859 --> 22:01.278
- Quinn.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.739
- Well, the cactus goo I used

22:03.822 --> 22:05.574
does have an...

22:05.657 --> 22:06.992
addictive quality.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.453
- Addictive?

22:09.536 --> 22:10.120
- Yeah.

22:10.203 --> 22:11.121
The more you eat,

22:11.204 --> 22:12.164
the more your body craves it.

22:12.247 --> 22:14.166
It makes people go crazy.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.625
It's what destroyed
the civilization

22:15.709 --> 22:16.918
of Guadalapichu in 1721.

22:17.002 --> 22:20.005
- Then why do you let us
inject it in all the Moon Bars?

22:20.088 --> 22:22.132
- It's very low-calorie!

22:23.175 --> 22:23.633
You want the last one?

22:23.717 --> 22:25.886
- Quinn!

22:25.969 --> 22:27.095
- We got to get rid of this.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.263
GIRL: Hey!

22:28.346 --> 22:30.640
