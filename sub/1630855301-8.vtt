WEBVTT

00:56.640 --> 01:01.019
- Hey, there.
- How you doing? Get a vodka tonic, please?

01:01.019 --> 01:03.105
- All right.
- Better make that a double.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.276
Let's do it again.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.449
Just that kind of a day.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.494
We all have 'em.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.288
Oh, not like mine.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.374
What are you drinking?

01:24.293 --> 01:25.377
Bud.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.087
- A Bud for my friend here.
- Sure.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.672
Well, thanks. I'm Marlin Reid.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.383
- Matt Doyle.
- Yeah.

01:33.844 --> 01:34.845
Hurt your arm?

01:35.470 --> 01:37.431
Yeah, uh, something happened at work.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.515
The hell do you work?

01:39.266 --> 01:40.517
If you don't mind me asking.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.352
No, I work down in Osterville.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.855
Kid stabbed me with a knife.

01:46.523 --> 01:47.524
Huh.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.654
What?

01:53.197 --> 01:56.617
No, nothing. Just looked too superficial
to be a stab wound is all.

01:57.534 --> 02:01.121
Okay. What, you a doctor?

02:01.705 --> 02:03.123
Nah, I'm a cop.

02:09.713 --> 02:12.007
- Up here?
- No, down in the city.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.262
You're a long way from home.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.097
I'm just working a case.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.391
Here you go. Thank you.

02:26.021 --> 02:30.651
Marlin, good luck with your arm.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.810
- Yeah?
- <i>Stan, it's Matty. I talked to him.</i>

03:04.810 --> 03:05.727
So tell me.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.187
<i>I don't think the wife
was telling the truth.</i>

03:07.187 --> 03:09.273
<i>I don't think he was with her
on the day. It doesn't matter.</i>

03:09.273 --> 03:12.025
<i>You can't ID him from the tape.
I think his alibi is bullshit.</i>

03:12.025 --> 03:14.361
- What, you got him to talk?
- <i>No, I didn't have to.</i>

03:15.237 --> 03:17.030
What are you now, the Amazing Kreskin?

03:17.030 --> 03:20.033
<i>Guy's got a scar on his arm.
Looks like it got grazed by a bullet.</i>

03:20.033 --> 03:23.036
I think the kid was telling the truth.
At least about that much anyway.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.788
I think the stepfather was there.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.707
As a matter of fact,
I think he was the target.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.085
Also, I didn't like his eyes.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.962
- His eyes?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

03:33.422 --> 03:36.133
All right. Well, thanks, Detective.
I owe you a beer.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.344
A beer? I'm in fucking bum-fuck here.
You owe me a case.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.973
You're doing really great, Dan.

05:47.973 --> 05:51.435
Understanding why the alters exist,
what purpose they serve,

05:51.435 --> 05:53.270
that's the first step in healing.

05:54.897 --> 05:55.898
Think back.

05:56.565 --> 05:59.109
What moment
brought Yitzhak into your life?

05:59.109 --> 06:00.527
<i>I'm so sorry, please.
I didn't mean to--</i>

06:03.864 --> 06:05.908
- That's enough, man.
- Fuck off!

06:07.326 --> 06:09.203
Bill, Bill, please.
Bill, please. Please.

06:11.163 --> 06:14.625
- What the fuck?
- Stupid boy. You should listen to friend.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.212
Hey!

06:22.090 --> 06:23.675
It was those kids from school,

06:24.384 --> 06:26.887
- the day that everything went to shit.
- Are you okay?

06:27.429 --> 06:28.931
Yeah, it's just, it's difficult.

06:29.515 --> 06:31.225
It feels like my head is caving in...

06:33.393 --> 06:35.562
...and that I'm stuck in a metal box.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.861
Danny, what?

06:44.988 --> 06:47.324
It's just something that Ariana once said.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.251
But she didn't, did she?

06:58.961 --> 07:00.462
No, you did.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.341
All of her feelings are inside of you.

07:07.219 --> 07:10.180
So, how did you feel
before Yitzhak emerged that day?

07:10.931 --> 07:11.932
I was terrified.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.726
So you brought out Yitzhak to protect you?

07:15.352 --> 07:17.479
In your case, the disorder's progressive.

07:18.480 --> 07:22.109
Your mind is splitting more and more.
Yitzhak and Ariana are symptoms.

07:22.109 --> 07:26.572
Yitzhak's function in particular
seems to be to react to physical threats.

07:26.572 --> 07:29.324
Yeah, well, I wish he could've
come around when I was younger.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.618
You had other saviors then.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.081
Time's up.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.209
You're doing great, okay?
Like I said.

07:39.793 --> 07:43.297
And right now,
you need to try and hold on to you.

07:44.131 --> 07:48.010
As we ramp up for trial,
do your best not to let the alters in.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.094
Okay?

07:49.928 --> 07:50.762
Simple as that.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.764
No, not that simple.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.685
- I'll see you in a few days.
- See you in a few days.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.484
<i>But this is what we prepared for.</i>

08:04.484 --> 08:06.737
No, this is what you prepared for.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.907
What, you worried about your grant?

08:10.574 --> 08:12.326
Fuck you, Stan.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.286
Insanity is his best chance.

08:14.286 --> 08:17.831
No, it's not. Do I need to remind you
of our little pretrial fiasco?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.000
'Cause according to
a half a dozen experts,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.961
your multiple personality disorder
isn't even a real thing.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.505
- They're wrong.
- And you're gonna prove that

08:24.505 --> 08:25.797
- on this kid's back?
- Yes.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.591
- No.
- I'm sorry?

08:27.591 --> 08:29.426
Rya, look, you did good.

08:30.344 --> 08:33.347
Because of your sessions with the kid,
we know about the stepfather.

08:33.347 --> 08:36.350
We know that he lied
about being on the scene.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.433
He's hiding something.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.938
And also because of you,
we both know what he's hiding.

08:41.522 --> 08:45.067
Now, if we can prove that this kid
went after him specifically,

08:45.067 --> 08:48.946
maybe for good reason,
then this wasn't a random shooting.

08:48.946 --> 08:51.865
What is important here is that we show
there is no history of violence

08:52.366 --> 08:54.535
and that the shooting was targeted. Personal.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.287
Then, we put this guy on the stand,
we rattle him,

08:57.287 --> 09:00.374
and maybe we can show
that the kid had good reason to shoot.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.293
The case goes from
six counts of attempted murder

09:03.293 --> 09:06.421
to one count of aggravated assault.
It's one-tenth of the sentence.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.340
No, he needs treatment, not jail.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.467
- His alters have receded for now...
- Rya--

09:10.467 --> 09:12.803
- ...but unless he gets help--
- We are a law office.

09:12.803 --> 09:13.887
We are not a hospital.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.432
Okay, so what happens when Jonny
mouths off to the wrong person,

09:17.432 --> 09:19.434
or when Yitzhak gets in a fight
that he can't win?

09:19.434 --> 09:20.936
Do you hear yourself?

09:20.936 --> 09:22.980
- He's not gonna survive prison.
- Will you pick up that phone?

09:22.980 --> 09:24.982
Stan, he will not survive prison.

09:24.982 --> 09:28.318
He's got a better chance of surviving
five years than 50.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.112
Or do you want to argue that too?

09:31.280 --> 09:34.658
He needs time to get better.

09:34.658 --> 09:38.412
According to the law,
what he's got doesn't exist.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.496
Fuck the law.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.874
The law doesn't give a shit
about mental health.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.960
Unless he can be integrated

09:44.960 --> 09:46.503
and come to terms with
what happened to him,

09:46.503 --> 09:48.005
he doesn't stand a chance.

09:49.047 --> 09:52.092
Look, you got until trial.

09:52.676 --> 09:53.677
Do your shrink thing.

09:53.677 --> 09:56.388
Fix him up. Whatever.
We are not putting him on the stand.

09:56.388 --> 09:57.514
In two weeks,

09:57.514 --> 09:59.808
I just need him to sit there
like a good defendant.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.186
If he pulls any of the wacko shit
in the courtroom,

10:02.186 --> 10:04.646
the prosecution will eat us alive, okay?

10:04.646 --> 10:08.317
I will work on getting him a reasonable
sentence, and everyone will be happy.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.484
That's not how it works.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.570
I cannot guarantee
he's going to be a good defendant.

10:11.570 --> 10:14.948
This is the best that we can do,
and it-it is a good outcome.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.117
And if you really care about the kid,

10:17.117 --> 10:21.288
stop trying to prove a point on his back
and take the win.

10:31.715 --> 10:34.927
Can I get one more for the road, Toby?
Got a big trial coming up.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.098
- They do it?
- Yep.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.017
Gonna get 'em off?

10:43.685 --> 10:44.686
Nope.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.400
Maybe he gets out with enough time.
Some kind of life, anyway.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.487
Well, best you can hope for, I guess, huh?
Some kind of life.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.079
Yep, that's the best we can hope for.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.029
Turn it down.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.005
Anyone come here, Candy?

11:54.715 --> 11:55.716
Who?

11:56.216 --> 11:59.219
Someone asking questions about my arm?

12:00.888 --> 12:01.889
Anyone else?

12:03.932 --> 12:05.392
Not since the first time.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.604
And I told them what you said to,
that I was with you that day.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.572
Nothing ever happens
that isn't both parents' fault.

12:19.823 --> 12:20.824
You know that?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.077
You know what I do for you, right?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.080
For your kid?

12:30.292 --> 12:31.919
What the fuck else you gonna do?

12:50.771 --> 12:52.064
Keep walking, weirdo.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.885
Can I ask you a question?

13:23.053 --> 13:26.223
The English guy coming back? Jack?

13:28.225 --> 13:29.309
Wait, you know Jack?

13:30.102 --> 13:31.103
Sure do.

13:31.895 --> 13:35.399
Said he was going to give me a chance
to win back some of my money.

13:35.399 --> 13:36.358
But, uh...

13:38.068 --> 13:40.654
Well, he hasn't really
been around here for a while.

13:41.822 --> 13:42.823
You don't remember?

13:45.242 --> 13:46.243
No.

13:48.745 --> 13:49.746
Wow.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.919
Wait, it doesn't bother you?

13:57.421 --> 13:58.589
Fuck do I care?

13:59.173 --> 14:01.508
You think you're the first con I've met
who's nuts?

14:02.551 --> 14:04.970
Guy can play cards and he's good company.

14:04.970 --> 14:08.348
Just don't bring back the Israeli.

14:10.559 --> 14:13.020
Sullivan, you got a visitor.

14:24.323 --> 14:25.657
You wanna see him or what?

14:27.659 --> 14:30.662
You had me worried.
Thought you didn't recognize me.

14:32.456 --> 14:37.169
They-They said in the paper
you got split personalities.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.254
So that's why you haven't called?

14:40.881 --> 14:41.715
Ari--

14:41.715 --> 14:43.008
You're Jerome, aren't you?

14:45.135 --> 14:46.428
She told me about you.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.138
Sh--

14:51.808 --> 14:54.728
I thought I didn't hear from you
'cause you didn't love me.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.443
I saw your picture in the paper,

15:01.443 --> 15:05.405
and I figured you could use a friend,
even if you didn't want to see me.

15:05.405 --> 15:09.493
But you don't even know me.

15:12.871 --> 15:13.872
I'm not her.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.167
So where is she?

15:20.254 --> 15:21.255
Not here.

15:24.341 --> 15:25.342
Yeah.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.637
She was always good at that.

15:30.764 --> 15:31.765
Disappearing.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.729
I'm sorry.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.353
- Hey, Carl.
- Hey, Ari.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.898
- Seven and seven.
- No kidding.

16:24.193 --> 16:26.361
Hi, there. I'm Grace.

16:28.447 --> 16:30.073
<i>Tell me about Ariana.</i>

16:30.073 --> 16:32.409
What did she do specifically?

16:34.203 --> 16:37.247
- She was my best friend.
- I know, but what did Ariana do?

16:54.431 --> 16:55.682
Well, um--

16:58.894 --> 17:00.771
She could have sex.

17:02.523 --> 17:03.524
She would have sex.

17:04.650 --> 17:05.983
Have you ever had sex, Danny?

17:07.653 --> 17:08.779
No.

17:08.779 --> 17:10.446
Well, not as me anyway.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.700
Okay. Let's stay with Ariana.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.203
I want you to imagine her.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.455
Imagine how she feels.

17:26.171 --> 17:29.758
She wanted to be close to people,
but she hid it.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.512
<i>She could just about get there, but then...</i>

17:35.305 --> 17:37.808
<i>...then she would just push them away.</i>

17:41.436 --> 17:43.730
<i>To be intimate is to be vulnerable.</i>

17:43.730 --> 17:46.817
And your childhood
was no place to be vulnerable.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.236
No, it was not.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.656
Having a system of alters
has helped you survive.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.617
They deal with feelings that you can't.

17:56.326 --> 18:00.998
But they are just constructs of your mind.
They're not perfect. Far from it.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.626
So the system isn't working?

18:04.626 --> 18:06.003
It worked for a long time.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.422
So let me ask you again.

18:11.550 --> 18:14.178
What did Ariana do for you?

18:29.902 --> 18:32.112
I think she was the keeper of
my loneliness.

18:33.614 --> 18:34.615
My fear.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.785
Yes, and your pain. All of your suffering.

18:39.286 --> 18:44.041
And she takes action
to resolve feelings when you can't.

18:44.875 --> 18:47.544
Like when you wanted
to be intimate with Annabelle.

18:48.879 --> 18:49.963
Like going after Marlin.

18:49.963 --> 18:53.550
Yes, she's starting to seep in.
They all are.

18:53.550 --> 18:56.512
Just your awareness of all of them
is making that happen.

18:56.512 --> 18:59.640
I've been reading about a new treatment.
It's called fusion therapy.

19:00.724 --> 19:04.978
It's a process that allows you to merge
with all of your alters.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.481
Your pieces will reintegrate.

19:08.982 --> 19:09.983
You'll be whole.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.531
I bet they don't
offer that in prison though.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.991
No, but we're gonna get you
the shortest sentence possible.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.579
Probably not short enough.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.251
We don't think like that, Danny.

19:34.967 --> 19:36.468
Will you listen to me?

19:36.468 --> 19:40.180
No, I don't have any more
'cause I'm already paying for the Buick,

19:40.180 --> 19:42.850
half the house, and the dog
I never get to see.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.437
All right. I gotta go.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.690
You the server?

19:49.690 --> 19:52.234
Address is on the front.
This one might be squirrelly.

20:02.911 --> 20:03.912
Marlin Reid?

20:04.913 --> 20:05.914
Who's asking?

20:07.708 --> 20:09.960
You're being served with a summons
to testify for the defense

20:09.960 --> 20:11.461
in the trial of Danny Sullivan.

20:21.597 --> 20:23.223
<i>Marlin has always been a threat to you,</i>

20:23.223 --> 20:26.268
and moving to the ghost house
separated you from that threat.

20:26.268 --> 20:29.229
But was there ever a time
that Yitzhak actually intervened?

20:30.105 --> 20:32.274
Actually protected you from Marlin?

20:34.151 --> 20:35.569
Shut up. Let me handle this.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.738
Do not speak to woman that way.

20:39.323 --> 20:42.075
- You are bully.
- Fuck, I'm struggling to stay with it.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.953
- Fuck.
- Okay. Try and see it without Yitzhak.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.580
How is this helping, Rya?

20:46.580 --> 20:48.832
Use your imagination, not your memory.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.084
Close your eyes.

20:54.755 --> 20:58.842
- Danny, baby--
- Shut up. Stop. Stop. Let me handle this.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.137
Do not speak to woman that way.

21:02.137 --> 21:06.183
You are a bully. All bullies are cowards.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.521
That's good, Danny.

21:11.688 --> 21:15.526
Let's go to that night in the ghost house.
What we talked about.

21:15.526 --> 21:19.613
Have the feeling,
but try to be inside Yitzhak.

21:19.613 --> 21:22.074
- Okay.
- Stay inside Yitzhak.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.203
What does it feel like?

21:27.371 --> 21:28.747
<i>Angelo, I'll give you the gun back.</i>

21:28.747 --> 21:32.960
You can have it. I just-- Shit. Fuck.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.962
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

21:34.962 --> 21:38.590
Oh, you're sorry? You're sorry,
motherfucker? I'ma show you sorry.

21:39.383 --> 21:41.009
I wouldn't hide, if I was you.

21:51.395 --> 21:52.896
How does Yitzhak feel?

21:55.107 --> 21:56.108
Strong?

21:57.276 --> 21:58.360
He feels...

22:00.404 --> 22:01.405
competent.

22:03.657 --> 22:06.285
- No!
- What do we got here?

22:06.285 --> 22:09.037
Bitch. What we got here?

22:09.037 --> 22:12.207
- What do we got here, huh?
- Danny! Danny!

22:14.710 --> 22:15.669
Shit.

22:22.968 --> 22:24.678
- Look at you.
- Please.

22:28.182 --> 22:29.433
This is what you want?

22:30.934 --> 22:33.979
- Who is bitch now?
- No. No, no, please.

22:33.979 --> 22:35.856
Who is bitch now, huh?

22:35.856 --> 22:37.316
No. No, no, no.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.487
You are bitch.

22:44.990 --> 22:46.200
Did you piss yourself?

22:51.038 --> 22:52.039
Run!

23:06.386 --> 23:07.304
Annabelle.

23:07.304 --> 23:08.514
Annabelle, it's okay.

23:08.514 --> 23:11.099
- No one's gonna hurt you now. You're safe.
- You get away from me.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.477
- Annabelle-- You're safe.
- Don't touch me! Get away from me!

23:13.477 --> 23:16.146
- Annabelle, it's okay. What-- Annabelle.
- Leave me alone!

23:16.730 --> 23:19.733
- Annabelle, please.
- Leave me alone!

23:22.319 --> 23:23.320
It was me.

23:25.656 --> 23:28.992
Annabelle, She was afraid of me.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.414
I'll tell you what...

23:53.642 --> 23:54.643
Hey!

23:56.144 --> 23:57.312
Hey, kid.

23:58.355 --> 23:59.356
Kid!

24:01.358 --> 24:03.527
You're the one
that does those voices, right?

24:09.116 --> 24:12.286
Come on. Come on. Do one for us.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.624
We want to see the freak show, freak boy.

24:20.252 --> 24:24.840
You won't even know. You won't even know.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.718
- Cut it out! Eat your food!
- All right, here we go.

25:11.303 --> 25:14.973
I hope it's okay, me coming back.

25:14.973 --> 25:16.308
Yeah, it's cool.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.020
I guess I just don't really know
what you want.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.024
I wasn't very sensitive,

25:24.733 --> 25:28.028
uh, to how hard this must be.

25:31.532 --> 25:35.410
Jerome. Nice to meet you, Danny.

25:40.832 --> 25:41.834
It's nice to meet you.

25:43.252 --> 25:46.421
I've heard a lot about you.

25:47.965 --> 25:50.342
All favorable, I hope.

25:51.802 --> 25:52.636
Mostly.

25:55.222 --> 25:58.308
Well, we had our ups and downs.

25:58.308 --> 26:01.353
But the ups made the downs worth it.

26:02.145 --> 26:03.897
At least for me.

26:03.897 --> 26:05.148
No, for her too.

26:07.234 --> 26:08.318
At least, I think so anyway.

26:09.611 --> 26:10.612
Thanks.

26:15.784 --> 26:16.785
Know how we met?

26:24.501 --> 26:26.003
The first time I see her,

26:27.504 --> 26:31.717
she's at the club giving shit
to this asshole at the bar.

26:32.259 --> 26:34.136
And so, I go over.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.430
Ask if she wants any help.

26:37.389 --> 26:40.017
Next thing I know, she's bitching me out,

26:40.017 --> 26:44.396
saying she's not some goddamn princess,
she can fight her own battles.

26:44.396 --> 26:45.564
Yeah, she can.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.816
And so, I tell her,

26:47.816 --> 26:49.234
I was only trying to help.

26:49.735 --> 26:54.406
She says if I really want to help,
I'd get her on the dance floor.

26:54.907 --> 26:56.783
Next thing I know,

26:56.783 --> 27:00.662
we're moving together
like we're two halves of the same person.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.376
<i>It's rare finding someone</i>

27:06.376 --> 27:09.963
<i>who understands your movement like that.</i>

27:20.641 --> 27:22.017
That was us.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.979
We understood each other
from that first night.

27:30.901 --> 27:32.319
Well, I can't dance for shit.

27:34.947 --> 27:37.324
I'm sure you've got some moves
in there somewhere.

27:37.908 --> 27:40.911
Apparently, I do have all these skills
hidden away in my subconscious.

27:42.955 --> 27:44.748
You must be thinking that I'm crazy.

27:44.748 --> 27:45.874
No.

27:47.376 --> 27:49.253
I'm thinking you must be lonely.

27:57.553 --> 28:00.430
If I don't go to jail,
there's a treatment, a therapy,

28:01.223 --> 28:03.684
to help me figure out
how I can become all of them.

28:04.685 --> 28:06.103
And how many are there?

28:06.103 --> 28:07.271
A bunch.

28:08.105 --> 28:09.064
Ooh-whee.

28:09.064 --> 28:11.942
My mom always said
I knew how to pick 'em.

28:11.942 --> 28:13.026
Ouch.

28:14.653 --> 28:17.364
In for a penny, in for a pound.

28:19.324 --> 28:20.450
Ariana used to say that.

28:20.450 --> 28:22.286
Yeah, I learned it from her.

28:24.204 --> 28:25.205
And from you.

28:29.459 --> 28:31.170
What if I don't like who I become,

28:32.713 --> 28:34.298
you know, after the therapy?

28:35.799 --> 28:40.012
I-I spent my whole life
trying to get right.

28:41.430 --> 28:42.514
Who I am.

28:43.891 --> 28:45.350
Black man.

28:45.350 --> 28:46.560
Gay man.

28:47.311 --> 28:48.478
Brave man.

28:49.104 --> 28:50.147
Coward.

28:50.898 --> 28:53.775
Troublemaker. Peacekeeper.

28:55.068 --> 28:57.529
Turns out, I'm all of them.

28:58.614 --> 29:00.073
Now, that doesn't make it easy.

29:00.073 --> 29:06.079
I've been beat up, spit on,
kicked out of every place you can imagine.

29:06.079 --> 29:08.040
But I know who I am.

29:09.208 --> 29:11.543
And no one can take that from me.

29:13.837 --> 29:15.297
Ariana knew who she was.

29:16.089 --> 29:17.508
She was proud of it.

29:18.008 --> 29:19.676
That's in you.

29:20.552 --> 29:23.555
That's a part of you.
She is a part of you.

29:24.181 --> 29:25.474
You do what the rest of us have to.

29:25.474 --> 29:29.353
You take the good parts of yourself
and you love 'em.

29:30.437 --> 29:33.774
And the bad, you try to make better.

29:34.525 --> 29:35.984
Best we can do.

29:37.486 --> 29:38.987
I can see why she liked you.

29:40.489 --> 29:41.657
Are you flirting with me?

29:41.657 --> 29:42.908
What? No.

29:42.908 --> 29:45.160
Relax, man.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.245
I'm kidding.

30:04.263 --> 30:06.557
<i>Rya. F-First, I-I know I'm meddling,</i>

30:06.557 --> 30:08.767
<i>but I just got off the phone with Martin.</i>

30:08.767 --> 30:10.853
<i>He says you've been missing class.</i>

30:12.062 --> 30:15.440
<i>Now, Rya, you know you could be
risking the whole tenure situation.</i>

30:15.440 --> 30:16.733
Fuck off, Greg.

30:21.363 --> 30:22.364
So, why London?

30:23.949 --> 30:25.742
Why did you go to London?

30:26.368 --> 30:28.245
Because Yitzhak gave me
the guidebook and told me to--

30:28.245 --> 30:29.788
No. There's no Yitzhak.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.541
I don't know, Rya.
Why don't you tell me what you think?

30:35.085 --> 30:36.420
Do you want some coffee?

30:36.420 --> 30:38.005
- What?
- I'm gonna get us coffee.

30:39.506 --> 30:40.507
Here's what I think.

30:41.216 --> 30:44.261
I think that despite their best efforts
to protect you,

30:44.261 --> 30:47.723
the alters were putting you in more
and more dangerous positions.

30:48.724 --> 30:51.268
Hey, is it possible for you to get us
two cups of coffee, please, Kevin?

30:51.268 --> 30:52.561
- Yeah, sure.
- Why?

30:53.729 --> 30:55.981
Like I said, the illness is degenerative.

30:57.065 --> 30:58.942
The alters can become erratic.

30:59.943 --> 31:02.154
And at certain points, for some people,

31:02.154 --> 31:04.656
the configuration may begin
to fail the host.

31:04.656 --> 31:10.621
So, the alters that were ultimately there
to protect me are now hurting me?

31:10.621 --> 31:11.955
The system's imperfect.

31:11.955 --> 31:15.584
No matter how sophisticated it is,
it's still a disconnection from reality.

31:16.168 --> 31:20.464
Disassociation takes a tremendous
amount of energy to maintain.

31:20.464 --> 31:23.717
And everything that happened to my mind
is because of what Marlin did to Adam?

31:24.676 --> 31:25.886
You tell me.

31:26.929 --> 31:28.680
Wait. What are you saying? That...

31:30.182 --> 31:32.309
he did something to me
that I don't remember?

31:33.310 --> 31:34.895
You think he did something to me too?

31:37.481 --> 31:38.607
Is that what you're saying?

31:41.193 --> 31:44.196
We're in London.
I want you to feel your way through that.

31:46.490 --> 31:47.491
Ariana was gone.

31:48.158 --> 31:50.077
I was wanted by the police. I needed help.

31:50.077 --> 31:50.994
So, what did you do?

31:51.912 --> 31:54.456
Apparently,
I sent myself to go and find my dad.

31:55.916 --> 32:00.295
A version of your father that you
imagined when you were a boy, maybe?

32:00.879 --> 32:01.922
Thank you.

32:01.922 --> 32:03.590
A father who would rescue me.

32:04.174 --> 32:05.926
What little boy hasn't hoped for that?

32:09.054 --> 32:10.722
Jack said everything
that I wanted to hear.

32:11.223 --> 32:12.724
Jack couldn't give you your real father,

32:12.724 --> 32:15.769
but he could give you the next best thing:
fatherly love.

32:15.769 --> 32:19.523
I think that maybe you created Jack
as a kind of self-rescue.

32:20.023 --> 32:21.733
What was it that he said to you? He said,

32:22.734 --> 32:25.529
"You have to go back
and face the music, Danny Boy"?

32:27.197 --> 32:28.532
<i>It's nice to see you again, Jack.</i>

32:29.116 --> 32:30.158
Is it?

32:31.076 --> 32:33.495
Your reluctance to being here notwithstanding,

32:33.495 --> 32:37.416
Danny's clearly in a lot of trouble.
And I'm hoping that you can help me.

32:37.416 --> 32:40.544
Well, I made him come back, didn't I?
Told him to--

32:40.544 --> 32:41.628
Face the music.

32:42.337 --> 32:47.676
So, I sent myself to London to go
and find my imaginary father,

32:47.676 --> 32:51.013
only to fail and then send myself back
to turn myself in?

32:51.013 --> 32:53.390
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes emotional sense.

32:54.183 --> 32:56.226
Your instinct after the shooting
was to run away,

32:56.226 --> 32:57.311
and Yitzhak helped you do that.

32:57.311 --> 33:00.022
And then you came back to reclaim
your life and face what you'd done.

33:00.022 --> 33:02.482
- Jack sent you back.
- That's fucking crazy.

33:02.482 --> 33:04.651
Although,
I guess that is kind of the point.

33:04.651 --> 33:06.695
Your feelings are normal, Danny.

33:06.695 --> 33:09.072
It's the way that you've learned
to express them

33:09.072 --> 33:12.159
through entirely different people
that's unique here.

33:12.159 --> 33:14.411
You know, it's quicker to just say crazy.

33:16.747 --> 33:17.789
Drink your coffee.

33:27.007 --> 33:28.008
Ms. Richards.

33:29.051 --> 33:31.929
I understand, uh, you're prosecuting
the Danny Sullivan case.

33:32.763 --> 33:33.931
Yes, I am.

33:33.931 --> 33:36.058
Uh, he's my stepson.

33:38.936 --> 33:40.312
Can we talk inside?

33:42.064 --> 33:45.317
Afternoon, Stan. Nice of you to stop by.

33:45.317 --> 33:46.693
Oh, funny. You're funny.

33:46.693 --> 33:47.778
From the DA.

34:19.726 --> 34:21.645
So, you don't remember first meeting
either of them?

34:21.645 --> 34:22.728
Mike and Jonny.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.940
No, I guess it was just like
they were always there.

34:24.940 --> 34:27.150
The way they present to the world,
they seem most like you.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.527
Would you say that's true?

34:29.485 --> 34:30.779
Yeah, I guess. Sure.

34:30.779 --> 34:32.906
- Whoo! Dude.
- Whoa, dude.

34:34.533 --> 34:35.534
All right.

34:36.243 --> 34:38.161
- Okay, so now what?
- Where's the money?

34:38.745 --> 34:40.038
Money's in my pocket.

34:40.038 --> 34:41.956
Okay. So, just, uh, be chill.

34:42.916 --> 34:45.002
- Be chill.
- Be chill? What the fuck does that mean?

34:45.002 --> 34:46.335
Be chill.

34:46.335 --> 34:47.754
- Can you go and get me--
- Will you please--

34:47.754 --> 34:49.422
- Mike, can you get me from the back?
- I got you.

34:51.592 --> 34:54.678
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

34:55.846 --> 34:57.764
<i>So, unless someone knew you really well,</i>

34:58.682 --> 35:00.934
they might not notice the differences.

35:00.934 --> 35:04.771
And maybe that's why your condition
went undiagnosed for so long.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.732
Okay.

35:06.732 --> 35:08.108
How are they different?

35:08.108 --> 35:11.111
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what do they do for you?

35:12.112 --> 35:13.822
What did they do that you couldn't do?

35:15.741 --> 35:16.742
What up, ladies?

35:19.453 --> 35:20.537
Stalker much?

35:21.538 --> 35:22.873
Special delivery.

35:25.959 --> 35:26.960
"Ghost house"?

35:28.212 --> 35:30.130
What? Your house doesn't have a name?

35:31.507 --> 35:32.966
Be there or be square.

35:32.966 --> 35:35.302
<i>Um, social skills. Friendships.</i>

35:36.136 --> 35:37.137
Mike was--

35:38.180 --> 35:40.933
He was awesome. He would look out
for me. He had my back, you know.

35:42.226 --> 35:43.227
And he--

35:43.727 --> 35:46.271
- he was really cool.
- So were you.

35:51.109 --> 35:52.945
You ripped out my heart.

35:52.945 --> 35:54.530
Can you let a man down easy?

35:55.614 --> 35:56.990
This is a lot better. Try that.

35:57.658 --> 35:59.576
- Dude, fuck off.
- Danny?

36:01.537 --> 36:03.997
- You said it was a party, right?
- Yeah.

36:05.749 --> 36:07.292
I guess I better roll some more joints.

36:09.336 --> 36:10.963
There are beers in the fridge.

36:13.549 --> 36:14.550
And Jonny?

36:19.680 --> 36:21.765
Danny? Jonny?

36:31.650 --> 36:33.777
Yeah, come here, friend.

36:44.663 --> 36:46.498
You liked that, huh?

37:01.930 --> 37:04.433
Danny, what are you seeing?

37:05.017 --> 37:06.435
I don't think I wanna talk about Jonny.

37:07.144 --> 37:08.770
What are you remembering about him?

37:08.770 --> 37:10.105
He was an escape artist, right?

37:10.105 --> 37:14.359
He-He helped you escape your house
with the money from dealing.

37:14.359 --> 37:16.778
Self-medication is a form of escape, right?

37:16.778 --> 37:18.447
I said I don't wanna talk about Jonny.

37:18.447 --> 37:19.781
- Why not?
- Because I don't.

37:19.781 --> 37:21.825
Danny,
you have to face all of your alters.

37:21.825 --> 37:23.368
- They are all parts of you.
- I don't wanna discuss Jonny.

37:23.368 --> 37:25.037
- Am I not making myself clear?
- Come on.

37:25.037 --> 37:26.205
Rya, fuck off.

37:27.289 --> 37:28.290
Good.

37:28.999 --> 37:30.042
You're angry.

37:31.043 --> 37:32.044
Yes, I'm angry.

37:32.794 --> 37:33.795
How does that feel?

37:34.379 --> 37:36.256
You're in control. You're in your body.
How does that feel?

37:38.926 --> 37:42.012
- Good. It feels good.
- Yeah, that's progress.

37:42.804 --> 37:47.434
You're already beginning to incorporate
the most segregated emotions,

37:47.434 --> 37:51.063
and over time
you will be able to reclaim them all.

37:51.772 --> 37:54.691
Over time? We don't really have
that much time, do we?

37:55.859 --> 37:56.860
No, we don't.

37:58.403 --> 38:01.031
One thing that I want you to think about

38:01.031 --> 38:04.785
when you come across things
in your history that upset you,

38:04.785 --> 38:08.455
one thing that links all of your alters
is that,

38:08.455 --> 38:11.792
all your life,
they've been trying to save you.

38:15.003 --> 38:16.713
Even if they don't want me talking to you?

38:18.257 --> 38:20.634
They don't think
that you can survive without them.

38:21.510 --> 38:24.555
And for a long time,
that was probably true.

38:26.265 --> 38:28.016
- But not anymore.
- But not anymore.

38:30.602 --> 38:33.522
<i>I think there's a secret message
in the fact</i>

38:33.522 --> 38:38.735
<i>that all of your alters
have been trying to save you, Danny.</i>

38:41.780 --> 38:42.990
And what's that?

38:43.866 --> 38:45.117
You see,

38:46.243 --> 38:47.411
<i>well, they're all you.</i>

38:51.832 --> 38:54.251
<i>Deep down,
you've been trying to save yourself.</i>

39:12.686 --> 39:14.271
Hey! Stop!

39:28.535 --> 39:29.912
I have something for you.

39:40.255 --> 39:41.256
It's for the trial.

39:49.723 --> 39:50.724
No way.

39:52.184 --> 39:54.061
- Is it new?
- Yes.

39:55.479 --> 39:56.939
I've never had a suit before.

40:04.821 --> 40:05.822
It fits you.

40:09.701 --> 40:10.827
Thanks.

40:11.787 --> 40:13.330
I'm gonna be right there the whole time.

40:14.665 --> 40:15.666
Okay?

40:17.459 --> 40:18.752
Yeah.

40:25.551 --> 40:26.552
Hey.

40:27.344 --> 40:28.345
Hey.

40:29.471 --> 40:32.099
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. You look better.

40:33.100 --> 40:34.101
I do?

40:34.601 --> 40:35.686
Calmer.

40:37.271 --> 40:39.439
Well, maybe it's the whole
trying-to-be-one-person thing.

40:41.775 --> 40:45.195
Um, look, I-I can't stay long.

40:45.737 --> 40:47.072
This is my last time coming.

40:47.072 --> 40:48.907
I just wanted to say it in person.

40:49.408 --> 40:50.951
It's nothing to do with you.

40:50.951 --> 40:53.745
But I have to be honest with myself,

40:53.745 --> 40:57.708
and there's a part of me
hoping she'll be here,

40:58.458 --> 41:00.627
which isn't fair to either of us.

41:01.503 --> 41:05.215
It's been good getting to know you, Dan. Um...

41:07.467 --> 41:08.719
I'm sorry about your troubles.

41:13.307 --> 41:14.725
I don't mind that you miss her.

41:18.187 --> 41:19.104
I miss her, too.

41:20.939 --> 41:22.983
Hey. I brought you something.

41:24.735 --> 41:27.571
It's a good-luck charm.

41:29.531 --> 41:33.744
When you wear it, maybe it can,
you know, remind you that you're you.

41:34.703 --> 41:37.039
And being you is-is no bad thing.

41:48.926 --> 41:49.760
Danny.

42:05.943 --> 42:06.944
Hey.

42:13.158 --> 42:13.992
Ari?

42:14.785 --> 42:16.411
You're so fucking sentimental.

42:19.456 --> 42:20.624
Hey.

42:23.794 --> 42:24.795
I miss you.

42:27.881 --> 42:28.882
I know.

42:31.802 --> 42:33.846
I love you so much.

42:37.599 --> 42:38.600
I love you too.

42:43.480 --> 42:44.731
She just wanted to say goodbye.

42:49.069 --> 42:50.153
Thank you.

42:54.449 --> 42:56.034
I'll see you around, Danny.

43:21.435 --> 43:23.937
- Again?
- You gotta be kidding me.

43:23.937 --> 43:25.689
This is bogus.

43:28.567 --> 43:29.860
What is so fucking urgent?

43:30.861 --> 43:32.446
Your Sullivan kid, that's what.

43:32.446 --> 43:33.822
What happened?

43:33.822 --> 43:35.741
We just got an updated witness list
from the DA.

43:36.450 --> 43:38.493
The stepfather went to the prosecution,

43:38.493 --> 43:40.621
and he says
he was just trying to protect his stepson,

43:40.621 --> 43:42.706
and that's why he didn't cop
to being shot.

43:42.706 --> 43:44.458
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah, well, maybe.

43:44.458 --> 43:47.169
But he says he can prove that
this wasn't an isolated incident

43:47.169 --> 43:49.546
and that Danny has a history of violence.

43:49.546 --> 43:52.633
Okay,
now he turned them on to some local case.

43:52.633 --> 43:55.177
He was saying that
there was a shooting inside of the house.

43:55.177 --> 43:57.971
The prosecution found some girl,
Annabelle Stone,

43:57.971 --> 43:59.723
a guy named Angelo Ruiz,

43:59.723 --> 44:02.267
that can tie Danny to that shooting
in the house,

44:02.267 --> 44:04.561
and that he has a history
of drug abuse and attempted murder.

44:04.561 --> 44:07.523
- Motherfucker.
- Now, if these witnesses pan out,

44:08.023 --> 44:10.359
this guy just signed
Danny's death warrant.

44:10.359 --> 44:12.861
Do you happen to know any chance
that they are not going to pan out?

44:12.861 --> 44:15.489
No, they will pan out. So, what do we do?

44:17.449 --> 44:19.910
I'm gonna go to the DA.
I'm gonna try to plead a deal.

44:19.910 --> 44:21.620
- Ten to 15 years. No parole.
- Ten years?

44:21.620 --> 44:25.624
Stop. Because if she says no--
And me, I would. I would say no.

44:25.624 --> 44:28.168
You better hope you can convince
the mother to testify,

44:28.168 --> 44:32.548
and a jury that this MPD shit is real,
and that Danny has got it after all.

44:32.548 --> 44:34.424
- But you said that would never work.
- Stan!

44:34.424 --> 44:35.926
Well, no, it never has.

44:35.926 --> 44:38.762
Which, in my opinion,
does not bode well in a court of law.

44:38.762 --> 44:42.140
But if it doesn't, he is going away
for the rest of his natural-born life.

44:42.140 --> 44:43.976
- Stan! Stan!
- What?

44:49.731 --> 44:51.733
<i>Just in case, what are we gonna do?</i>

44:51.733 --> 44:53.777
- <i>What are we gonna do?</i>
- <i>How do we get out?</i>

45:06.123 --> 45:07.207
<i>Just in case.</i>

45:33.984 --> 45:35.402
Fuck. Come on.

45:36.862 --> 45:38.155
Open the doors! Open the doors!

45:41.408 --> 45:43.243
Damn it, Sullivan.
It's always something with you.

45:43.243 --> 45:45.829
- I think I broke my wrist.
- Let's get you to the infirmary.

45:45.829 --> 45:47.080
God! Fuck.

46:02.596 --> 46:03.889
This gonna hurt?

46:09.770 --> 46:11.605
Lights out in two minutes, Sullivan.

46:40.342 --> 46:41.343
Lights out!

46:43.345 --> 46:44.596
Just in case.
