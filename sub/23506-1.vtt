01:35.656 --> 01:38.336
<i>Achtung Achtung! Feind in Sicht.</i>

01:38.492 --> 01:40.960
<i>Alles in Stellung. Alles in Stellung.</i>

01:42.537 --> 01:45.717
<i>Alle Maschinen für den Kampf bereit.</i>

02:45.934 --> 02:49.066
- You're off course by two degrees.
- Yes Sir!

02:50.605 --> 02:53.109
You've got to watch them all the time...

02:53.650 --> 02:55.038
Captain...

02:55.360 --> 02:57.661
...otherwise they'll become sloppy.

03:00.282 --> 03:03.129
They'll become very, very sloppy.

03:05.203 --> 03:07.209
I think we should join the party, Captain.

03:08.165 --> 03:09.921
Damn the passengers...

03:10.250 --> 03:11.971
...to see, to become a Captain,

03:12.252 --> 03:13.593
...not a party host...

03:14.004 --> 03:15.048
...you take care of her.

03:16.548 --> 03:19.016
She'll be all yours in another three days.

03:20.594 --> 03:21.637
I will.

03:24.014 --> 03:25.853
Check her position every 30 minutes...

03:26.224 --> 03:29.772
...and tell the purser I will NOT be
attending the over 50s party tomorrow.

03:29.936 --> 03:30.979
Yes Sir!

03:31.772 --> 03:33.444
Unless you'd care to go...

03:33.774 --> 03:36.621
...I'm told you're an
excellent conversationalist.

03:37.486 --> 03:39.325
That depends on whom I'm talking to Sir.

03:41.198 --> 03:42.289
Bastard!

03:42.574 --> 03:43.997
Thank God it's his last trip!

04:04.054 --> 04:06.771
- Come on everyone, let's move!
- Good evening Mrs. Marshall.

04:11.269 --> 04:13.855
Nick, I want to dance!

04:21.279 --> 04:23.035
I wish I was 20 years younger!

04:23.240 --> 04:25.245
You're not Cyril,
you'll have to dance with me.

04:33.875 --> 04:36.841
Why don't you go to bed,
you can't keep your eyes open?

04:37.045 --> 04:38.433
Yes I can!

04:39.131 --> 04:42.061
Another half hour Long John Silver
and you're going to bed!

04:42.301 --> 04:43.343
That's not fair!

04:43.468 --> 04:45.473
She's staying up, why can't I?

04:45.679 --> 04:46.722
I'm older.

04:47.764 --> 04:49.485
Now that's enough, both of you.

05:02.529 --> 05:04.000
Ooh baby!

05:06.616 --> 05:08.040
You can come with me!

05:08.243 --> 05:09.286
Hey, great!

05:09.911 --> 05:12.629
Now we've all had lots of booze
and what have...

05:12.789 --> 05:14.592
...you all must be feeling very happy?

05:14.791 --> 05:16.428
Let me hear yah, happy?

05:16.960 --> 05:18.965
I can't hear you, a little louder,
are you happy?

06:06.009 --> 06:08.388
Oh, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I see our captain has joined us.

06:08.470 --> 06:09.513
Captain, welcome.

06:09.638 --> 06:10.812
On behalf of everybody, Captain...

06:10.973 --> 06:13.393
...I would like to thank you
for a very smooth trip...

06:13.558 --> 06:15.231
...especially the overland section.

06:16.019 --> 06:17.360
Captain, how about a little bow?

06:18.855 --> 06:20.362
Let's hear it for the Captain!

06:24.277 --> 06:25.535
Thank you.

06:28.115 --> 06:30.914
Gentlemen, a little music if you please.

06:34.538 --> 06:38.334
Forty years at sea and you end up being a
straight man for a smart-ass comedian.

06:39.501 --> 06:42.296
I wonder what sort of jokes he'll make
about me when I take command?

06:42.421 --> 06:44.841
None darling.
Nobody ever makes jokes about you.

06:46.675 --> 06:48.063
Am I as stuffy as that?

06:48.218 --> 06:49.429
I wouldn't know.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.476
I hardly ever see you out of your uniform.

06:53.765 --> 06:55.023
Wait until tonight.

07:27.466 --> 07:30.313
Sir... take a look a this.

07:36.558 --> 07:38.112
It's on a collision course!

07:38.602 --> 07:39.812
Twenty degrees port!

08:18.141 --> 08:19.981
Can I have that please?

08:20.310 --> 08:21.353
Ben!

08:23.605 --> 08:25.326
Is it past your bedtime?

08:25.983 --> 08:27.703
Ben, that's greedy!

08:28.151 --> 08:31.200
Robin, be an angel and take Ben
below and put him to bed.

08:31.446 --> 08:32.205
Say goodnight, Ben.

08:32.322 --> 08:33.365
Come on!

08:36.659 --> 08:38.167
Good night mum.

08:39.830 --> 08:40.921
Good night son.

08:42.624 --> 08:43.667
I'm sorry!

08:53.802 --> 08:55.225
Thank you band, thank you.

08:55.762 --> 08:57.186
Now, Ladies and Gentlemen...

08:58.390 --> 09:01.238
...we are coming to the
end of a very long...

09:01.810 --> 09:04.491
...and beautiful voyage.

09:08.233 --> 09:10.319
How about a little appreciation
for a great band...

09:10.652 --> 09:12.159
...Mal Diamond and the Boys.

09:18.452 --> 09:20.836
Maybe you'll get used to all of this.
I never did.

09:22.456 --> 09:24.675
Cruising around in endless circles...

09:25.959 --> 09:29.637
...blue-rinse ladies repeating "have
a nice day!" over and over again...

09:29.921 --> 09:31.594
...and then having to
have dinner with them...

09:31.673 --> 09:35.137
...so that they can go back to Akron
or Toronto or wherever...

09:35.302 --> 09:37.054
...and say that they ate with the Captain.

09:47.564 --> 09:49.035
I thought daddy was the Captain?

09:49.191 --> 09:51.278
No dummy, not till the next trip!

09:51.443 --> 09:54.291
Good! Then I can get all the cake I want!

09:54.905 --> 09:56.376
Ben, come back!

10:32.317 --> 10:33.788
Whatcha doing now?

10:34.027 --> 10:35.071
I gotta go!

10:35.237 --> 10:36.279
You've just been!

10:36.530 --> 10:38.451
Well I gotta go again.

10:38.740 --> 10:39.783
Ben.

10:40.617 --> 10:41.660
Women.

10:52.587 --> 10:54.806
It's as if it's deliberately
trying to ram us.

10:56.258 --> 10:57.515
Full to port.

10:57.884 --> 10:58.927
Fast!

11:01.763 --> 11:03.187
Get me the Captain.

11:07.686 --> 11:10.486
My Husband was so anxious
to come on this cruise.

11:11.315 --> 11:13.818
But, when God calls,
you have to go.

11:14.192 --> 11:16.328
- Pardon?
- He died, just before we sailed.

11:16.862 --> 11:19.994
I'm not grieving.
I mean, he had a wonderful life.

11:20.365 --> 11:22.451
And he would have wanted
me to come on this cruise.

11:22.576 --> 11:24.830
- Are you a religious man?
- Excuse me.

11:26.121 --> 11:30.001
He's a wonderful man.
But he's not religious.

11:30.334 --> 11:31.377
How many more days?

11:31.710 --> 11:32.753
Two and a half.

11:33.045 --> 11:34.172
Are you counting?

11:35.213 --> 11:37.717
Now listen,
you promise you'll forget me!

11:38.050 --> 11:39.177
I promise.

11:41.678 --> 11:44.359
I know.
You say that to all the girls.

11:44.514 --> 11:45.557
You're right.

11:46.642 --> 11:48.481
What do you want me to say?

11:50.395 --> 11:52.650
I don't want you to say anything.

12:10.123 --> 12:11.511
Signal him to alter course!

12:11.667 --> 12:12.960
We have, Sir!

12:13.210 --> 12:14.930
Well signal him again, dammit!

12:16.797 --> 12:18.387
Full astern!

13:13.687 --> 13:15.490
Let's get the hell out of here!

13:15.856 --> 13:17.113
It's going down fast!

13:17.441 --> 13:18.483
Come on!

13:18.525 --> 13:19.568
Come on, let's go!

13:57.230 --> 13:58.903
We've got to hold our position.

13:59.316 --> 14:01.321
Make it easier for Air and Sea Rescue.

14:03.070 --> 14:05.241
They did get a distress
signal off, didn't they?

14:08.450 --> 14:09.707
Of course they did.

14:57.207 --> 14:58.299
Daddy, daddy!

14:58.709 --> 14:59.302
What is it?

14:59.584 --> 15:00.925
There's something in the water!

15:08.635 --> 15:09.809
Give me a hand!

15:09.970 --> 15:11.013
Come on!

15:11.972 --> 15:13.146
It's the Captain!

15:14.641 --> 15:15.684
The poor man!

15:21.273 --> 15:22.316
Make some room.

15:25.610 --> 15:26.653
Give him air.

15:27.446 --> 15:29.036
He's breathing, He's alright.

15:29.239 --> 15:31.493
- Captain, you poor thing!
- He'll be alright.

15:33.702 --> 15:35.339
Is he alright?

15:37.039 --> 15:39.126
What can we do for him?

16:26.630 --> 16:28.267
Wake up Margaret!

16:28.799 --> 16:29.973
Margaret, it's a ship!

16:30.342 --> 16:31.385
Wake up!

16:32.177 --> 16:33.220
Ahoy!

16:34.930 --> 16:35.973
Ahoy!

16:36.640 --> 16:37.683
Ahoy!

16:40.018 --> 16:41.572
Hello up there!

16:42.062 --> 16:44.067
Is anybody up there, Ahoy!

16:46.316 --> 16:47.870
Ahoy!

16:54.825 --> 16:57.624
Hello! Ahoy!

17:05.544 --> 17:07.050
Ahoy!

17:07.337 --> 17:08.724
Ahoy!

17:23.895 --> 17:25.069
Hello!

17:29.192 --> 17:31.114
Is anybody up there?

17:33.697 --> 17:36.414
Hey! Anybody home?

17:41.997 --> 17:43.040
Look!

17:43.540 --> 17:45.011
They've lowered the ladder!

17:45.167 --> 17:46.835
Well at least someone on board heard us.

17:50.172 --> 17:52.640
What would a ship
be doing anchored out here?

17:52.966 --> 17:55.185
I don't know.
Maybe some sort of engine failure?

17:58.722 --> 17:59.814
Steady! Steady!

18:00.557 --> 18:01.600
Right. I got it.

18:06.188 --> 18:07.279
Mind the Captain!

18:12.319 --> 18:13.991
Nick, go take a look.

18:35.884 --> 18:36.596
Hello?

18:36.718 --> 18:37.892
Hello, anyone on watch?

18:38.011 --> 18:39.222
Hello! Hello!

18:39.930 --> 18:40.973
Anybody here?

18:41.056 --> 18:42.099
Hello!

19:00.784 --> 19:02.670
There's no one here!

19:03.996 --> 19:05.206
Okay Ben, up you go.

19:05.580 --> 19:06.623
Careful now.

19:18.969 --> 19:20.143
You next.

19:23.974 --> 19:25.611
Come on Robin. Come on.

19:26.727 --> 19:28.483
Come on. Give me your hand.

19:33.025 --> 19:34.199
See where he's going.

19:34.443 --> 19:36.448
Ben! Come here!

19:44.328 --> 19:45.370
Ben!

19:48.832 --> 19:49.875
I had to go!

19:50.500 --> 19:52.719
You should wait till we find the washroom!

20:11.647 --> 20:13.319
Nick, give me a hand!

20:13.690 --> 20:14.983
Coming Sir!

20:21.740 --> 20:23.294
That's it... that's it.

20:24.159 --> 20:25.202
Easy!

20:38.053 --> 20:39.096
Hang on.

20:39.680 --> 20:40.723
Hang on!

20:49.440 --> 20:50.650
Trevor!

20:53.986 --> 20:54.781
Nick!

20:54.945 --> 20:56.238
The Captain!

21:07.750 --> 21:09.720
Nick! Come in here!

21:10.628 --> 21:11.885
Damn your ladder!

21:19.261 --> 21:21.101
We've got to get the rope around him.

21:25.810 --> 21:26.852
Hold him there!

21:27.019 --> 21:28.656
I'll pull him from above.

22:44.221 --> 22:45.894
Okay Sir... I've got you.

22:54.982 --> 22:56.655
- Is he okay?
- Yes Sir.

22:58.694 --> 22:59.987
There must be someone on watch.

23:00.070 --> 23:01.572
- See if you can find 'em.
- Yes Sir.

23:04.492 --> 23:05.535
Give me a hand!

23:09.580 --> 23:10.707
Let's sit him here.

23:13.083 --> 23:14.127
Here, let me.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.503
Are you alright?

23:15.544 --> 23:16.587
I'm fine.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.469
It's not so bad...

24:06.470 --> 24:07.894
...we're out of the water...

24:08.514 --> 24:09.855
...and it's a nice day, huh?

24:10.057 --> 24:11.315
We could clear this mess up...

24:11.559 --> 24:13.361
...play a little shuffleboard, get a tan...

24:13.894 --> 24:15.567
...we'll have a nice trip. Whaddaya say?

24:17.731 --> 24:18.942
What's going on!

24:20.484 --> 24:21.409
Oh my God... Jackie!

24:21.527 --> 24:22.570
Get me down! Please!

24:23.112 --> 24:24.951
For God's sake, can you get me down!

24:25.448 --> 24:26.740
Jackie, grab my hand!

24:27.032 --> 24:28.919
I feel so stupid up here!

24:29.201 --> 24:30.328
You can grab my arm!

24:30.536 --> 24:31.579
Grab it!

24:31.787 --> 24:32.998
What's the matter with you?!

24:33.414 --> 24:34.457
Oh Jesus... Jesus!

24:35.291 --> 24:36.333
Grab me!

24:37.168 --> 24:38.461
Grab my hand!

24:38.627 --> 24:39.719
Grab him! Come on!

24:43.174 --> 24:44.597
It's swinging me out!

24:44.925 --> 24:46.183
It's swinging me out!

24:46.927 --> 24:48.220
Don't let me drop!

24:49.555 --> 24:51.192
Hey... don't let me drop!

24:51.432 --> 24:52.475
Get me back!

24:53.434 --> 24:54.477
Get me back!

24:56.479 --> 24:57.866
Get me back!

24:59.774 --> 25:00.948
I'm going up!

25:02.359 --> 25:03.402
Help me!

25:03.652 --> 25:04.695
Please!

25:24.799 --> 25:25.973
Jackie, your hand!

26:06.549 --> 26:08.102
No Trevor, don't!

26:08.300 --> 26:09.474
The propellers!

26:09.718 --> 26:10.761
He's drowning!

26:10.803 --> 26:11.846
He's drowning!

27:15.201 --> 27:17.787
Come on darling, it's alright.
It's alright.

27:17.995 --> 27:18.838
Up you go.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.959
Come on... let's see what's in here.

28:22.768 --> 28:24.191
Ben... is that you?

28:24.437 --> 28:25.479
Yes Dad!

28:30.818 --> 28:31.910
Come on.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.535
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.443
Dammit.

29:13.068 --> 29:15.619
What do we do now?
Do we just go on?

29:16.280 --> 29:17.407
Be careful.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.201
Watch your heads.

29:33.714 --> 29:35.268
<i>Herr Ashland...</i>

29:36.550 --> 29:40.145
<i>Kapitän Ashland...
können Sie Mich hören, Kapitän?</i>

29:42.598 --> 29:45.528
<i>Dieses Schiff hat auf Sie gewartet.</i>

29:47.228 --> 29:50.858
<i>Es ist Ihr neues Schiff, Kapitän.</i>

29:51.357 --> 29:52.994
<i>Können Sie Mich hören, Ashland?</i>

29:55.027 --> 29:56.498
<i>Ashland...</i>

29:57.363 --> 29:59.166
<i>...es ist lhre Chance...</i>

30:00.032 --> 30:01.705
<i>...worauf warten Sie noch?</i>

30:02.284 --> 30:05.049
<i>Ein neues Schiff...
Ein neues Kommand.</i>

30:06.330 --> 30:07.623
<i>Ashland...</i>

30:12.586 --> 30:13.629
<i>...jetzt!</i>

30:15.840 --> 30:17.809
<i>...Ihre Chance ist gekommen.</i>

30:57.798 --> 31:01.346
This old ship...
seems to have a life of it's own.

31:03.471 --> 31:04.764
Let's keep moving.

31:04.889 --> 31:06.609
Mummy, I'm frightened!

31:30.706 --> 31:33.257
Oh come on Robin, it's alright.

31:33.417 --> 31:35.588
Robin. Come on sweetie.

31:35.669 --> 31:38.297
Come on honey. Nothing can happen
as long as we're all together.

31:38.839 --> 31:39.882
Come on.

31:40.549 --> 31:42.601
It smells a bit funny in here.

31:48.015 --> 31:49.308
I wonder where the crew are?

31:51.060 --> 31:53.610
Wherever they are, they certainly
don't care about this ship.

31:53.729 --> 31:55.781
What nationality can they be?

31:56.107 --> 31:57.198
How about German?

31:57.441 --> 31:58.699
- German?
- Yeah, look at this.

32:00.194 --> 32:04.666
It says... er... "Please replace games
where you found them", I think.

32:04.949 --> 32:05.991
It's German.

32:06.534 --> 32:07.576
I'm thirsty!

32:07.701 --> 32:08.744
Me too!

32:09.537 --> 32:12.751
Come on, let's see if we can find
the galley and get some water, hmm?

32:13.082 --> 32:14.505
Come on Robin, get up.

32:17.336 --> 32:20.718
Listen, I'm going to try and find
some clothes for everyone - okay?

32:27.054 --> 32:28.644
I could use some help with Ashland.

32:28.848 --> 32:30.520
Well I... I'll try and help you.

32:37.606 --> 32:38.649
This it it, mum.

32:41.485 --> 32:44.867
Right Robin, you start over there,
and Ben and I will start over here.

33:05.551 --> 33:08.481
Robin, now be careful
and don't eat anything.

33:25.654 --> 33:29.166
No no darling! Don't drink that!
No, not until we boil it, right?

33:29.325 --> 33:30.997
That's it, there's a good boy.

34:15.496 --> 34:16.588
Anybody there?

35:25.941 --> 35:27.662
The steam comes up here
and runs down there.

35:27.735 --> 35:29.206
That's called condensation.

35:29.612 --> 35:30.739
That's right Robin.

35:30.988 --> 35:32.031
We learned it at school.

35:32.281 --> 35:35.211
Just proves that not everything
you learn in school is useless, hmm?

36:38.848 --> 36:39.975
Oh look!

36:49.275 --> 36:50.901
Darling, there's some water over there.

36:51.110 --> 36:52.367
Oh, thanks.

36:56.490 --> 36:57.831
Has anyone seen Nick?

36:58.742 --> 36:59.785
No.

37:14.800 --> 37:15.843
Hello.

37:17.928 --> 37:19.020
Hello! Hello!

37:20.097 --> 37:20.643
Hello!

37:21.056 --> 37:22.480
Who's there?

37:25.478 --> 37:26.520
Hello!

37:33.277 --> 37:34.535
Probably Nick?

37:34.945 --> 37:35.988
Probably.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.142
<i>Ashland...</i>

37:53.464 --> 37:55.516
<i>...können Sie Mich hören, Kapitän?</i>

37:57.676 --> 38:00.357
<i>Sie sind hier endlich in Sicherheit.</i>

38:02.056 --> 38:03.609
<i>Ich erwarte Sie auf der Brücke.</i>

38:05.101 --> 38:06.143
<i>Sofort!</i>

38:08.187 --> 38:09.741
<i>Kommen Sie zur Brücke!</i>

38:39.552 --> 38:41.224
These old ships'll row on anything.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.014
Even wet blotting paper.

38:50.688 --> 38:51.730
Nick!

38:54.567 --> 38:55.777
Nick, can you hear me?

39:00.030 --> 39:01.205
Coming!

39:04.201 --> 39:05.244
Nick!

39:09.248 --> 39:11.585
This door was locked.
What the hell's going on here?

39:11.709 --> 39:12.503
Did you find anyone?

39:12.668 --> 39:13.712
No. There's nobody on board.

39:13.836 --> 39:15.129
Well, where are they?

39:16.005 --> 39:16.717
C'mon Nick.

39:16.881 --> 39:18.304
Don't let this door shut!

39:18.924 --> 39:19.967
What happened to you?

39:37.999 --> 39:40.335
What is it with this ship?
It's like it's running itself.

39:43.630 --> 39:45.136
Take me to the chart room.

39:47.467 --> 39:52.640
<i>Kapitän Ashland, Sie gehören zum Schiff.
Sie müssen es sofort führen.</i>

39:54.724 --> 39:56.361
<i>Sofort!</i>

39:58.395 --> 40:00.067
I've gotta get to the bridge.

40:01.606 --> 40:03.077
No Captain Ashland, No.

40:03.900 --> 40:05.621
What... ship is this?

40:06.319 --> 40:08.787
I don't know Captain Ashland.
No-one knows.

40:09.197 --> 40:13.040
Captain Asland. No...
No, you... must lay down.

40:13.660 --> 40:14.703
Rest.

40:15.704 --> 40:16.746
Rest!

40:18.164 --> 40:19.207
Rest.

40:21.543 --> 40:22.585
That's odd.

40:23.586 --> 40:24.630
The course marked on this chart...

40:24.754 --> 40:26.756
...just goes around the Atlantic
in huge circles.

40:31.177 --> 40:32.565
Captain, take a look at this.

40:42.313 --> 40:45.031
This equipment must be
over forty years old.

40:51.364 --> 40:53.369
We can't use this junk
to send out a signal.

40:54.993 --> 40:56.703
Let's hope our first message got through.

41:01.499 --> 41:02.591
Look at this!

41:03.418 --> 41:04.889
This one's about Hitler.

41:05.253 --> 41:05.930
Who is he?

41:06.254 --> 41:08.971
A rather unpleasant man,
he started World War Two.

41:09.382 --> 41:10.723
Is this Hitler?

41:11.718 --> 41:12.761
Not quite...

41:13.053 --> 41:14.095
The King of England.

41:21.478 --> 41:23.565
<i>♪ I know a perfect recipe... ♪</i>

41:24.022 --> 41:25.774
<i>♪ ...and everything that worries me... ♪</i>

41:25.815 --> 41:29.244
<i>♪ ...it's simple, shall
I pass it along? ♪</i>

41:30.278 --> 41:32.330
<i>♪ Well if you want to wear a smile... ♪</i>

41:32.530 --> 41:34.666
<i>♪ ...and be so happy all
the while, just... ♪</i>

41:38.244 --> 41:40.047
Listen. There's that music again.

41:40.455 --> 41:41.048
He's wrong.

41:41.122 --> 41:42.415
There is someone else on board.

41:43.333 --> 41:44.376
Let's take a look.

41:44.459 --> 41:45.218
Come on Ben.

41:45.377 --> 41:46.551
Let's stay together.

42:03.937 --> 42:05.574
This is incredible.

42:06.314 --> 42:08.651
What the hell are those
engines using for fuel?

42:14.614 --> 42:16.500
All these gauges read zero.

42:16.991 --> 42:18.332
Come on, let's get outta here.

42:18.535 --> 42:19.578
Lead the way!

42:21.037 --> 42:22.591
We've gotta get off this ship!

42:22.831 --> 42:23.958
The lifeboats!

42:32.424 --> 42:36.018
That's odd. I'm sure it was coming
from this direction.

42:37.303 --> 42:39.474
- Not in there.
- Maybe it's in the next room.

42:41.057 --> 42:42.611
It's a movie house.

42:43.017 --> 42:44.820
Movie house? It can't be.

42:45.895 --> 42:48.066
Can we run the film mummy? Can we?

42:48.732 --> 42:50.203
I don't know.

42:50.692 --> 42:51.735
Let's see.

42:57.991 --> 42:59.034
It works!

43:12.130 --> 43:14.265
<i>♪ I know a perfect recipe... ♪</i>

43:14.424 --> 43:16.263
<i>♪ ...and everything that worries me... ♪</i>

43:16.426 --> 43:19.772

43:20.597 --> 43:21.765
<i>♪ Well if you want to... ♪</i>

45:14.294 --> 45:15.635
Mrs Morgan...

45:18.214 --> 45:19.257
Mrs Morgan...

45:20.800 --> 45:22.473
- What? What is it?
- It's a movie.

45:22.802 --> 45:24.095
- Come quick!
- A movie?

45:52.665 --> 45:54.421
It should work, It looks well greased.

45:56.628 --> 45:58.797
Let's go below, get cleaned up,
and get the others...

45:59.005 --> 46:00.476
...and get off this ship.

46:17.065 --> 46:18.821
Stop moaning and put the lights on.

46:18.900 --> 46:19.943
I'll get it.

46:30.120 --> 46:33.216
What's happening to... to me?

46:33.415 --> 46:34.457
Mrs Morgan!

46:39.170 --> 46:41.721
Don't touch her mummy!
She's poisonous!

46:47.554 --> 46:49.440
Robin! Come back! Robin!

47:23.423 --> 47:24.716
Help me.

47:25.091 --> 47:25.850
Help...

47:26.134 --> 47:27.771
<i>Töten Sie, Ashland...</i>

47:28.511 --> 47:29.804
<i>...das ist das richtige!</i>

47:33.516 --> 47:35.023
<i>Töten Sie, Ashland...</i>

47:35.727 --> 47:36.819
<i>...worauf warten Sie?</i>

47:37.520 --> 47:39.157
<i>Es tut nicht weh.</i>

47:48.823 --> 47:49.748
What happened to you?

47:49.866 --> 47:52.998
Daddy, daddy, I'm real frightened.
Can we all get off this ship please.

47:54.829 --> 47:56.301
Thank God.

47:56.456 --> 47:57.583
It's Mrs Morgan.

47:59.876 --> 48:01.003
Stay with them Nick.

48:01.336 --> 48:02.379
Oh Nick.

48:21.940 --> 48:22.982
She's dead.

48:25.694 --> 48:28.458
Of a seizure. It was quite quick.

48:29.531 --> 48:31.452
At least she won't be in pain any more.

48:32.742 --> 48:35.875
I suggest you assemble everyone
for a burial at sea.

48:46.798 --> 48:49.515
We are gathered here to
pay our last respects...

48:50.093 --> 48:51.896
...to a wonderful woman...

48:53.012 --> 48:55.397
...that sadly, we knew
for such a short time.

48:55.724 --> 48:57.894
Those are quite the wrong words,
Marshall.

48:59.102 --> 49:01.072
Perhaps you will allow me?

49:15.869 --> 49:17.043
Let us pray...

49:17.287 --> 49:19.873
...for the soul of our
dearly departed sister.

49:20.582 --> 49:22.421
O God, whose mercies cannot be numbered.

49:23.251 --> 49:26.264
Accept our prayers on behalf
of our servant departed...

49:26.504 --> 49:29.138
...and grant her entrance into
the halls of light and joy...

49:29.299 --> 49:33.309
...in the fellowship of thy saints
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

49:34.012 --> 49:35.055
Amen.

49:35.138 --> 49:36.181
Amen.

49:36.639 --> 49:38.395
Almighty God, we commend her spirit...

49:38.516 --> 49:40.185
...and we commit her body to the deep...

49:40.268 --> 49:42.687
...in the sure hope of the
resurrection and eternal life...

49:42.937 --> 49:44.943
...through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.

50:16.638 --> 50:17.432
The boats!

50:17.680 --> 50:18.932
The boats are our last chance!

50:19.140 --> 50:20.183
Damn it I know it!

50:26.314 --> 50:27.357
Quick, the other boat.

50:56.511 --> 50:58.148
They're floating away, Dad!

50:58.263 --> 50:59.686
This damned ship!

50:59.889 --> 51:01.776
It's like it's alive,
trying to kill us!

51:45.560 --> 51:47.281
Marshall!

51:52.859 --> 51:56.074
Can you step up to the Bridge please.

52:15.507 --> 52:17.594
Would you care to inspect the Wheel House?

52:35.151 --> 52:39.411
Charts, sextant, log book.

52:41.741 --> 52:43.034
Daily sailing orders.

52:44.619 --> 52:46.422
Main steering gear.

52:48.289 --> 52:50.129
How do you like my chair, Marshall?

52:50.333 --> 52:52.219
Ideal for long trips.

52:57.048 --> 52:58.555
Did you say "your" chair?

52:58.717 --> 53:01.896
Yes.
You'll get one when you are a Captain.

53:03.054 --> 53:07.064
In the meantime, this is my ship,
and I am the Captain.

53:11.312 --> 53:13.318
Would you like to steer her?

53:14.274 --> 53:17.323
All of my previous passengers
liked to do that.

53:17.485 --> 53:19.537
They liked to pretend to be a Captain.

53:20.113 --> 53:21.156
Like you.

53:22.949 --> 53:24.372
But it's no so easy.

53:25.452 --> 53:26.494
Try it.

53:47.932 --> 53:50.151
You took my last ship from me.

53:50.477 --> 53:51.864
You won't get this one.

53:54.022 --> 53:55.742
I didn't take your ship from you.

53:56.483 --> 53:57.870
The company took it from you.

53:58.818 --> 53:59.992
And you know why?

54:00.403 --> 54:01.874
Because you can't deal with people.

54:02.113 --> 54:04.157
You don't know how to handle
a crew or passengers.

54:04.824 --> 54:06.212
Maybe so Marshall.

54:07.035 --> 54:09.420
But I know how to handle ships.

54:20.131 --> 54:21.342
Engine room!

54:21.925 --> 54:23.313
Full ahead!

54:31.267 --> 54:35.858
A captain never leaves his post,
even a pretend captain like you, Marshall.

54:38.316 --> 54:39.490
Ashland, you're sick.

54:40.652 --> 54:41.993
I'm taking command of this ship.

54:43.363 --> 54:44.455
You can't.

54:46.408 --> 54:49.622
No one can take this ship away from me!

55:01.172 --> 55:02.679
Where do you plan to sail her?

55:03.633 --> 55:05.223
Eternity, Marshall.

55:07.429 --> 55:08.472
Eternity.

55:16.563 --> 55:19.066
Come on Robin.
I want you to try and get some rest.

55:19.232 --> 55:20.620
I can't. I'm too scared.

55:20.775 --> 55:23.575
Oh shhh... there's nothing we can do
until tomorrow morning.

55:23.820 --> 55:26.703
Why? Why do we have to wait?
I wanna go now.

55:26.865 --> 55:28.336
Quiet. You'll wake Ben.

55:29.909 --> 55:31.167
Now listen to me.

55:31.327 --> 55:33.664
I want to get off this ship
as much as you do, but...

55:35.165 --> 55:38.712
...we've got to wait until it's light so
we can all see what we're doing.

55:39.044 --> 55:41.927
Daddy thinks it's best that
we stay right where we are.

55:43.798 --> 55:45.768
We're warm, and dry and...

55:46.634 --> 55:49.268
...we've got something to eat, and...
well...

55:50.805 --> 55:52.016
Understand?

56:00.398 --> 56:01.442
What is it?

56:01.733 --> 56:03.323
Ashland's totally schizophrenic.

56:03.735 --> 56:05.822
He's taken on the role
of a German naval officer.

56:06.613 --> 56:09.578
It's as if this ship has somehow
taken possession of him.

56:09.991 --> 56:11.034
Where is he now?

56:11.076 --> 56:12.499
I left him in the Wheel House.

56:14.621 --> 56:16.211
- Ben's sleeping?
- Yes, yes.

56:24.798 --> 56:28.093
We'll lock ourselves in for the night,
til we figure a way to get off this ship.

56:29.344 --> 56:30.387
C'mon.

57:46.921 --> 57:48.013
Robin.

57:49.883 --> 57:50.926
Robin?

57:53.720 --> 57:55.143
What now?

57:55.346 --> 57:56.390
I gotta go.

57:56.598 --> 57:59.315
You can't, not now.
Hold it til morning.

57:59.642 --> 58:00.685
I can't.

58:05.148 --> 58:07.865
Come with me Robbie. Please.

58:08.568 --> 58:09.779
Alright...

58:11.488 --> 58:12.781
Men!

58:34.928 --> 58:36.055
Where is it?

58:36.221 --> 58:38.142
I don't know, but we'll find it.

58:42.102 --> 58:43.692
No Ben.

58:44.145 --> 58:45.901
But it's getting desperate!

59:12.590 --> 59:14.227
Hurry up, Ben!

59:16.219 --> 59:18.936
Okay! I'm ready.

59:24.185 --> 59:25.988
Lori, I love you.

59:29.190 --> 59:30.233
Do you?

59:32.569 --> 59:33.611
Do you?

59:34.487 --> 59:37.252
If you had asked me a week ago,
I'd have said no.

59:39.951 --> 59:42.003
Now, maybe.

59:45.248 --> 59:47.585
Come on. Let's take a shower.

01:00:14.734 --> 01:00:15.778
I'm scared.

01:00:15.985 --> 01:00:18.370
You're scared? I'm scared shirtless!

01:00:18.613 --> 01:00:20.700
It's shitless... oops!

01:00:20.948 --> 01:00:23.417
Never mind. I'm just trying to be polite.

01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:26.625
- I know lots of other words like...
- Okay wise guy.

01:00:26.788 --> 01:00:28.175
I think...

01:00:28.915 --> 01:00:29.840
...we...

01:00:29.957 --> 01:00:31.429
...we should go down there.

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:34.300
- You sure?
- Think so.

01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:36.260
You go first then.

01:00:36.422 --> 01:00:38.807
- You're smallest, you go.
- No, you.

01:00:38.925 --> 01:00:40.894
Men first, Ladies last.

01:00:41.177 --> 01:00:44.025
- Since when?
- Since now. Go on!

01:00:46.224 --> 01:00:47.896
What ya whistling for?

01:00:48.601 --> 01:00:50.653
If we get lost, we can hear each other.

01:00:51.062 --> 01:00:52.901
- That's stupid.
- No it isn't.

01:00:57.694 --> 01:00:58.986
Ben?

01:01:01.572 --> 01:01:02.664
Ben!

01:01:17.922 --> 01:01:20.259
Nick, open the door.

01:01:22.719 --> 01:01:25.055
Hang on a minute. Looks like it's stuck.

01:01:30.059 --> 01:01:33.156
Nick... this is blood!

01:01:33.563 --> 01:01:35.116
It's blood!

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.030
Hold on... just hold on!

01:01:40.445 --> 01:01:41.951
Hold on, Lori! Hold on!

01:01:46.159 --> 01:01:47.879
Somebody help me!

01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:51.046
Help me! Help me!

01:01:56.919 --> 01:01:58.889
Ben, are you down there?

01:02:12.727 --> 01:02:15.740
Let me out of here please!

01:02:22.028 --> 01:02:23.998
Ben, I'm coming down!

01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:35.177
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!

01:02:38.503 --> 01:02:39.760
Help me!

01:02:40.254 --> 01:02:41.346
Lori!

01:02:42.173 --> 01:02:43.845
Lori! Don't give up!

01:03:02.819 --> 01:03:04.409
<i>Holt Eure Maschinengewehre.</i>

01:03:04.696 --> 01:03:06.036
<i>Munition nicht vergessen.</i>

01:03:06.155 --> 01:03:07.828
<i>Schnell, Schnell...
den Patronengürtel!</i>

01:03:08.491 --> 01:03:10.578
<i>Alles fertig? Ja!</i>

01:04:37.372 --> 01:04:38.546
Robin!

01:04:39.332 --> 01:04:40.459
Ben!

01:04:41.376 --> 01:04:42.716
Where are you?

01:04:44.045 --> 01:04:45.255
Ben!

01:04:46.506 --> 01:04:47.597
Robin!

01:04:48.174 --> 01:04:49.348
Answer me!

01:05:05.674 --> 01:05:07.265
Let me help you.

01:05:31.575 --> 01:05:32.833
Daddy!

01:05:50.928 --> 01:05:55.021
C'mon. Let's go find mum. C'mon.

01:06:09.947 --> 01:06:10.991
It's Lori.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.451
Stay here, all of you.

01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:21.342
Shh... try and get some sleep.

01:06:55.451 --> 01:07:01.833
And to our mighty God, we commend her soul,
and we commit her body to the deep!

01:07:02.124 --> 01:07:03.298
No!

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:09.219
Ashland you crazy bastard!

01:07:09.298 --> 01:07:11.766
We've gotta stop him before
he gets to someone else!

01:07:40.037 --> 01:07:41.544
This way!

01:09:58.259 --> 01:10:00.430
My God!

01:10:09.603 --> 01:10:12.237
What the hell are these?

01:10:12.898 --> 01:10:14.868
Gold teeth.

01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:20.702
This must have been used
as an interrogation ship.

01:10:31.292 --> 01:10:33.297
It's still running.

01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:27.391
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!
Come on!

01:12:20.401 --> 01:12:22.655
Stop it!

01:12:38.335 --> 01:12:41.550
For God's sake! Stop It!

01:14:51.552 --> 01:14:53.557
This ship needs blood, Marshall...

01:14:54.013 --> 01:14:55.057
...needs blood...

01:14:55.514 --> 01:14:56.688
...it must have blood...

01:14:57.057 --> 01:14:58.185
...must have blood...

01:14:58.601 --> 01:15:00.154
...blood to survive...

01:15:00.728 --> 01:15:01.570
...blood...

01:15:01.687 --> 01:15:02.730
...your blood...

01:15:02.813 --> 01:15:04.653
...and the blood of your wife...

01:15:04.899 --> 01:15:06.405
...blood of your wife...

01:15:06.650 --> 01:15:08.157
...the blood of your children...

01:15:08.527 --> 01:15:09.915
...blood of your children...

01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:11.281
...blood of your children...

01:15:11.405 --> 01:15:12.330
...your wife...

01:15:12.448 --> 01:15:17.087
...wife... children... children...
children... blood, Marshall...

01:15:17.495 --> 01:15:19.621
...must have blood...
this ship needs blood, Marshall...

01:15:19.622 --> 01:15:22.671
...must have blood...
this ship needs blood, Marshall...

01:16:00.287 --> 01:16:01.379
What's happening?

01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.835
I don't know what's happening.
But we've got to get off this ship!

01:16:03.999 --> 01:16:05.471
But there aren't any boats!

01:16:05.543 --> 01:16:07.753
There may be something
we can use in the ship's store.

01:16:29.567 --> 01:16:30.609
Keep them back...

01:16:31.944 --> 01:16:33.036
Margaret, keep them back!

01:16:56.552 --> 01:16:58.142
What is it mummy? What's in there?

01:16:58.345 --> 01:16:59.388
It's...

01:16:59.472 --> 01:17:02.105
It's... it's not... not for you.
Just stay there!

01:17:47.728 --> 01:17:48.820
Margaret...

01:17:49.563 --> 01:17:50.987
...put these on the kids.

01:17:51.941 --> 01:17:53.484
What are you going back in there for?

01:17:54.485 --> 01:17:56.237
There's something else in here we can use.

01:18:17.466 --> 01:18:19.103
- Come on!
- I'll help you daddy!

01:18:19.343 --> 01:18:20.684
- Attaboy, Ben. Grab the other end.
- Robin, you take this.

01:18:20.803 --> 01:18:21.846
Pick it up!

01:18:23.973 --> 01:18:24.518
Up you come.

01:18:24.807 --> 01:18:25.850
That's it.

01:18:25.975 --> 01:18:27.017
Come on.

01:18:27.184 --> 01:18:28.311
Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:18:30.146 --> 01:18:31.320
We've got to stop this ship.

01:18:48.721 --> 01:18:50.726
Keep this life jacket on all the time.

01:18:51.974 --> 01:18:53.185
Now, do you hear me Robin?

01:18:53.309 --> 01:18:54.351
Yes, mummy.

01:18:58.022 --> 01:18:59.065
Get down!

01:19:07.198 --> 01:19:09.369
No-one leaves my ship, Marshall!

01:19:12.536 --> 01:19:13.579
No-one!

01:19:28.052 --> 01:19:29.095
Come on, Ben!

01:19:30.596 --> 01:19:31.639
Come on!

01:19:32.348 --> 01:19:33.391
Go!

01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:41.232
Run!

01:19:44.735 --> 01:19:45.778
Stay down!

01:19:49.073 --> 01:19:50.627
Go to the children, quick!

01:20:13.472 --> 01:20:15.275
Hurry, children, hurry!

01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:37.507
That's right Robin, push!

01:20:38.914 --> 01:20:39.957
Go, Ben!

01:20:42.877 --> 01:20:44.218
Alright Robin, get ready!

01:20:46.714 --> 01:20:47.757
Go!

01:20:51.385 --> 01:20:52.726
Swim for the raft!

01:20:54.847 --> 01:20:56.769
No-one leaves my ship!

01:21:01.979 --> 01:21:03.486
Trevor!

01:21:13.449 --> 01:21:14.492
No!

01:21:15.034 --> 01:21:15.461
No!

01:21:15.743 --> 01:21:18.211
Get in there, you bitch!

01:21:34.095 --> 01:21:38.318
<i>- Achtung Achtung! Feind in Sicht.
- Alles in Stellung.</i>

01:21:38.599 --> 01:21:40.687
<i>Achtung Achtung! Alle Mann an Deck.</i>

01:22:20.975 --> 01:22:22.268
Trevor!

01:22:22.351 --> 01:22:24.190
Trevor!

01:22:36.699 --> 01:22:38.918
Ben... Robin... where's mum?

01:22:39.035 --> 01:22:40.707
She's still on the ship!

01:22:41.287 --> 01:22:42.331
Trevor!

01:22:50.963 --> 01:22:53.217
Alright... Margaret...

01:22:58.721 --> 01:22:59.895
Alright...

01:23:00.097 --> 01:23:01.140
Yes!

01:23:20.951 --> 01:23:22.209
Hard to port!

01:23:28.584 --> 01:23:31.966
You bastards! When I give an order
I expect it to be obeyed!

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.470
Do you hear me?!

01:23:34.673 --> 01:23:37.717
<i>Verfolgen Sie eine 30
Grad Steuerbordwendung.</i>

01:23:37.718 --> 01:23:41.182
<i>Voraussichtliche Berührung mit
Feind um 21.00 Uhr.</i>

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.990
I am your Captain!

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.621
I command you to alter course!

01:24:05.037 --> 01:24:06.460
Ben... give me that.

01:24:06.997 --> 01:24:08.125
Sit over here.

01:24:44.577 --> 01:24:50.461
<i>Kurs und Position ein. 190 Grad
Steuer voraus. Volle Kraft voraus...</i>

01:25:31.248 --> 01:25:32.376
It's going the other way.

01:25:33.584 --> 01:25:34.627
We made it!

01:25:37.129 --> 01:25:38.683
We'll be alright now.

01:25:41.384 --> 01:25:42.426
Keep paddling!

01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:46.013
That's it.

01:25:51.435 --> 01:25:54.449
Roger, base. We'll make just one
more sweep then we're headed home.

01:26:00.861 --> 01:26:01.455
Hold it!

01:26:01.862 --> 01:26:03.250
I think we've got something here.

01:26:03.989 --> 01:26:08.498
Yeah! We have a raft.
One, two, three, four... Yeah, four people.

01:26:08.911 --> 01:26:10.418
No sign of any further survivors.

01:26:12.081 --> 01:26:14.335
Hello! Hey! Hello!

01:26:14.625 --> 01:26:16.168
They seem to be in pretty good shape.

01:26:17.253 --> 01:26:18.759
Heading in to execute rescue.

01:26:20.423 --> 01:26:25.263
We're safe, Margaret. We're safe.
Robin... we're alright!
