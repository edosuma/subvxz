Original air date
January 13, 2012

00:12.676 --> 00:15.726
Sync and corrections by Gatto
for www.addic7ed.com

00:16.437 --> 00:19.073
Divided by war.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.999
In an effort to end the galactic conflict

00:22.119 --> 00:25.882
The first ever sanctioned meeting between
the Republic and the Separatists will be held.

00:26.002 --> 00:30.142
And Mandalore is chosen as neutral ground
for this precarious meeting.

00:30.901 --> 00:35.688
Tensions run high as many hold hope
for these important negotiations.

00:36.330 --> 00:39.056
The Republic recognizes the tragedy of war,

00:39.314 --> 00:42.245
but there is nothing we can change
that is already occurred.

00:42.365 --> 00:44.248
Say it aloud before this gathering

00:44.618 --> 00:47.519
As representative for chancellor Palpatine,
that you declare

00:47.719 --> 00:51.502
without reservation,
the separatist state legitimate.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.929
I have something to say
about the legitimacy of the separatists.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.209
Why is Lux Bonteri here?

01:02.475 --> 01:05.770
- What he have to say?
- He was not invited.

01:05.890 --> 01:10.815
- You didn't mention that Lux Bonteri would be here.
- I didn't know.

01:19.993 --> 01:23.553
I stand before you, son of Mino Bonteri,

01:23.673 --> 01:27.415
loyal separatist,
a patriot, a friend.

01:32.180 --> 01:37.544
It is come to my attention that my mother
was murdered by Count Dooku in cold blood!

01:37.664 --> 01:39.386
That is a lie!

01:39.646 --> 01:42.931
Remove this traitor immediately.

01:44.031 --> 01:46.261
I will not be silenced.
Hmm.

01:46.381 --> 01:47.727
Stop this!

01:47.987 --> 01:50.811
We would ask to respect that we
deal with this matter ourselves.

01:50.931 --> 01:53.186
No, Dooku is deceiving you!

01:53.306 --> 01:56.069
You all be betrayed
just like my mother!

01:56.189 --> 01:59.566
I apologize for such a rude interruption.

02:00.075 --> 02:01.485
Please leaders continue.

02:03.381 --> 02:05.463
We can't just let them take him.

02:05.465 --> 02:06.781
He'll be killed.

02:06.901 --> 02:09.913
Do what you can,
Ahsoka, but be discreet.

02:44.566 --> 02:49.581
Those are some rather strong accusations
you have levied against me.

02:49.841 --> 02:53.076
You know what you did, Dooku.

02:53.196 --> 02:53.983
Do I?

02:54.103 --> 02:59.591
I have done a lot of things, young man, and
choose to remember them in order of importance.

02:59.851 --> 03:03.888
The death of your mother seems to have...
escaped to me.

03:04.605 --> 03:06.661
I will have my revenge.

03:07.415 --> 03:10.877
I thik it is time we reacquaint
the young senator with his mother.

03:12.302 --> 03:13.352
Kill him.

03:16.821 --> 03:17.965
Ahsoka?

03:23.261 --> 03:26.254
Lux, I think it's time to go,
don't you?

03:31.139 --> 03:33.666
Artoo, fire up the engines.
We're leaving.

03:41.809 --> 03:42.885
Run!

03:50.234 --> 03:51.468
Right!
Hurry!

03:51.588 --> 03:53.920
- Ahsoka, I appreciate your help, but--
- Keep moving.

04:00.794 --> 04:03.660
Captain Taggar, you've got incoming clenkers.

04:03.989 --> 04:05.431
We'll cover you, sir!

04:27.859 --> 04:30.052
Ahsoka, Padme just contacted me.

04:30.172 --> 04:32.659
She told me the peace negotiations evolve at last.

04:32.779 --> 04:33.560
Where are you?

04:33.820 --> 04:35.776
I'm on route to Coruscant, master.

04:35.896 --> 04:37.531
I have Lux Bonteri with me.

04:37.651 --> 04:39.788
Master jedi, I'm sorry if I have
caused you any trouble.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.433
It's nothing.

04:41.731 --> 04:44.097
You'll be safe now with the republic.

04:45.540 --> 04:46.243
All right.

04:46.514 --> 04:48.258
Bring Bonteri to Coruscant immediately,

04:48.378 --> 04:51.077
- we'll discuss giving him amnesty.
- Yes master.

04:52.796 --> 04:54.300
I can't go with you, Ahsoka.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.957
Hmm.
What?

04:56.159 --> 04:58.044
I told you, I have a plan.

04:59.830 --> 05:02.039
Shooting me is not going
to be part of it.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.578
What are you doing with a gun anyhow?

05:04.698 --> 05:05.769
You're not a fighter.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.394
I'm no longer a Separatist either.

05:07.978 --> 05:09.372
I won't join the Republic.

05:09.492 --> 05:11.541
What other options do you have?

05:12.011 --> 05:13.640
There is a different way.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.869
I understand everything that
you you have been trough.

05:15.989 --> 05:17.982
I understand you feel alone.

05:18.102 --> 05:20.802
But the Republic <i>will</i> help you.

05:20.922 --> 05:22.620
Like they helped my mother?

05:24.120 --> 05:26.633
I already made contact with
a group on Carlac who are noble

05:26.753 --> 05:28.498
and are allied with my cause.

05:28.618 --> 05:30.393
And what cause is that?

05:30.513 --> 05:32.236
To kill Dooku.

05:33.669 --> 05:36.724
The only one you're going
to get killed is yourself.

05:38.092 --> 05:39.159
I'm sorry,

05:39.279 --> 05:41.103
but I'm taking you to Coruscant.

05:41.223 --> 05:43.688
You're plan hasn't exactly
been well thought-out, Lux.

05:43.808 --> 05:47.300
Without me, how do think you
were going to escape those droids?

05:47.420 --> 05:48.176
Like this!

05:50.274 --> 05:51.841
I'm sorry, Ahsoka.

06:00.542 --> 06:02.344
It's seems Ahsoka is quite exausted.

06:02.453 --> 06:04.537
She probably should sleep it off.

06:20.051 --> 06:21.003
Lux?

06:22.648 --> 06:23.729
Lux?

06:27.141 --> 06:29.008
Where are my lightsabers?

06:35.098 --> 06:36.152
Lux!

06:36.653 --> 06:40.413
Artoo, take a look around and see
if you can find where Lux hid them.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.721
I'm going to have a little chat with Mr. Bonteri.

06:52.750 --> 06:57.114
Lux! Lux where are we and
what did you do with my lightsabers?

06:57.364 --> 06:59.056
You should have stayed on the ship.

07:10.665 --> 07:13.136
Hey, kid, you're late.

07:13.396 --> 07:15.346
Death Watch.

07:32.192 --> 07:33.931
You get us what we need?

07:34.051 --> 07:36.242
Yes, I have the information with me.

07:36.502 --> 07:38.324
Who's this?

07:38.444 --> 07:39.746
I'm his...

07:40.006 --> 07:42.183
I'm his... betrothed.

07:43.154 --> 07:45.293
Uh, right.
Right.

07:45.553 --> 07:46.648
Betrothed?

07:49.473 --> 07:51.881
A little skinny, is't she?

07:53.652 --> 07:55.595
She serves her purpose.

08:00.026 --> 08:01.225
We leave now.

08:01.485 --> 08:02.851
The snow is coming.

08:02.971 --> 08:04.824
What have you gotten us into?

08:04.944 --> 08:06.344
It's all under control.

08:10.244 --> 08:11.921
These are the Dead Watch.

08:12.041 --> 08:13.379
They're Mandalorian terrorists.

08:13.499 --> 08:14.774
- They'll kill us both.
- Are you coming?

08:14.894 --> 08:16.532
- Yes.
- Uh...

08:16.652 --> 08:18.377
I should stay with the ship.

08:18.497 --> 08:20.617
No, you're coming too.

09:03.798 --> 09:04.997
Why?

09:07.385 --> 09:08.292
Why?

09:28.531 --> 09:30.022
The boss will see you in there.

09:37.331 --> 09:39.438
Don't ruin my plan, Okay?

09:39.558 --> 09:41.617
Plan? What plan?

09:41.877 --> 09:44.029
This is a holo-trace device.

09:44.295 --> 09:46.865
It can identify the origin of any holo transmission.

09:47.429 --> 09:50.828
I knew if I accused of murder,
I would be brought to face him.

09:51.313 --> 09:53.296
Well, it worked,

09:53.416 --> 09:55.684
and I know now Dooku's exact location.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.391
If Death Watch moves quick enough,

09:57.511 --> 09:58.598
We can destroy him.

09:58.895 --> 10:00.928
Is that enough of a plan for you?

10:01.048 --> 10:03.787
This is not some idealistic political group,

10:03.907 --> 10:06.309
they will take the information and kill you.

10:07.076 --> 10:08.894
I knew you wouldn't understand.

10:09.312 --> 10:11.389
The Death Watch are murderers.

10:11.509 --> 10:13.081
Sworn to destroy jedi.

10:13.201 --> 10:15.485
You don't know what you're doing.
This...

10:17.413 --> 10:19.659
Am I interuuptig something?

10:20.380 --> 10:23.117
N-no, of course not. We were just....

10:24.587 --> 10:26.757
It's time to talk business.

10:28.456 --> 10:32.099
- Tell your woman to leave us.
- Of course.

10:36.489 --> 10:38.132
Now...

10:38.392 --> 10:40.280
give me what I want.

10:40.936 --> 10:43.145
When I know that you will use it correctly.

10:43.415 --> 10:45.577
Don't toy with me, boy!

10:45.697 --> 10:47.410
You see this scar?

10:47.530 --> 10:50.125
It was a parting gift from Count Dooku.

10:50.946 --> 10:55.263
If you question my resolve to destroy him again,
I will give you one just like it.

10:56.330 --> 10:58.413
This device will tell you his location.

11:01.103 --> 11:03.939
Good. That was painless, wasn't it?

11:04.502 --> 11:06.328
Now let's celebrate!

11:19.993 --> 11:21.450
Repair these droids

11:21.570 --> 11:24.144
So we can use them for target practice.

11:24.505 --> 11:27.481
Again.

11:31.868 --> 11:34.735
Please reassemble us.

11:34.855 --> 11:37.022
Please reassemble us.

11:37.511 --> 11:40.457
- Please reassemble us.
- We are battle droids no longer.

11:40.577 --> 11:45.078
Please reassemble us.

11:59.707 --> 12:02.174
- Try that again, and I will--
- Shh!

12:02.434 --> 12:04.485
You don't want to make 'em angry.

12:04.806 --> 12:06.929
They are far from rational.

12:07.189 --> 12:09.161
Uh. Believe me.

12:09.281 --> 12:11.119
You have no idea.

12:12.868 --> 12:13.853
What's your name?

12:14.113 --> 12:14.979
Thralla

12:15.239 --> 12:17.820
I'm Ahsoka. We're you from?

12:18.384 --> 12:20.671
We were kidnapped from in nearby town.

12:20.791 --> 12:22.347
We are a simple people.

12:22.467 --> 12:23.999
We trust easily.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.823
And we were betrayed.

12:27.098 --> 12:29.448
We feast. Prepare the food.

12:29.568 --> 12:31.536
Your masters are hungry.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.879
Hungry?

12:56.474 --> 12:59.388
Careful not to choke on your stupidity.

13:01.738 --> 13:04.134
I see your woman has fit in well.

13:04.254 --> 13:05.780
Now how are you fit in?

13:06.040 --> 13:07.946
All I want is Dooku dead.

13:08.259 --> 13:09.309
Visla!

13:13.248 --> 13:14.674
Chieftain Pieter,

13:15.003 --> 13:17.055
I don't remember summoning you.

13:18.543 --> 13:20.392
You have taken our women,

13:20.512 --> 13:23.572
stolen our food and
threatened us for too long.

13:24.683 --> 13:28.344
It's brave for you to come
here with such bold words.

13:28.604 --> 13:30.828
You are no longer welcome here.

13:31.430 --> 13:34.086
Well, if our presence here isn't welcome...

13:34.206 --> 13:36.406
we'll make ready to leave.

13:40.366 --> 13:42.942
And you'll return our people to us?

13:43.062 --> 13:45.891
Yes. Sunrise tomorrow.

13:46.204 --> 13:47.614
You have my word.

13:48.634 --> 13:49.762
Very well.

13:50.357 --> 13:51.893
We'll be waiting.

13:57.925 --> 14:01.416
You see? They're not the butchers
you make them out to be.

14:26.779 --> 14:28.508
You have kept your word.

14:29.239 --> 14:32.262
We are very grateful
for your understanding.

14:39.383 --> 14:41.287
I am a man of my word.

14:41.601 --> 14:43.136
Here is your granddaughter,

14:43.418 --> 14:44.608
as promised.

14:44.728 --> 14:45.768
No!

14:45.888 --> 14:46.589
Thralla!

14:50.259 --> 14:52.475
Kill them!
Kill them all!

14:57.972 --> 14:59.585
Run for you life!

15:01.355 --> 15:03.000
Run for your lives!

15:04.408 --> 15:07.112
Save them, Ahsoka.
Save them.

15:07.232 --> 15:09.695
Save my people.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.007
Why? What're you doing?

15:13.127 --> 15:16.535
Never let the weak tell you what to do.

15:16.795 --> 15:18.911
Welcome to Death Watch.

15:32.436 --> 15:33.751
Argh!

15:37.232 --> 15:38.474
Ah!

15:55.834 --> 15:58.601
Now what do we have here?

15:58.721 --> 16:01.264
I think we caught us a jedi!

16:04.507 --> 16:05.979
Drag her back to camp.

16:18.526 --> 16:21.963
Thank you, friend.
How can we repay you?

16:43.584 --> 16:46.701
Rescue your friend.
How?

16:49.095 --> 16:50.442
I compute.

16:50.755 --> 16:52.996
I will prepare the others.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.017
Now, Lux Bonteri.

17:03.137 --> 17:05.002
This does not look good.

17:05.122 --> 17:07.104
This does not look good at all.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.625
I ask you to join us in good faith, and you

17:10.744 --> 17:12.571
bring a jedi into our camp!

17:12.932 --> 17:14.781
She wasn't meant to be here.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.512
Please, let her go.

17:16.633 --> 17:18.866
I'm afraid that's not a option.

17:19.126 --> 17:21.134
I believed you had honor,

17:21.253 --> 17:24.690
but you are just murderers
no better than Dooku.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.742
You call us murderers?

17:26.862 --> 17:28.723
And yet it was your own lust for revenge

17:28.843 --> 17:30.541
that made you seek us out.

17:30.661 --> 17:33.172
I wanted justice for my mother's death.

17:33.292 --> 17:34.474
And you shall have it.

17:34.594 --> 17:38.761
But the jedi are no different from Dooku
and this one shall pay in part

17:39.021 --> 17:41.210
for their crimes against Mandalore.

17:41.330 --> 17:43.546
Show you see It's not murder at all.

17:43.666 --> 17:45.559
It's like you say...

17:46.147 --> 17:47.698
It's justice!

17:52.034 --> 17:53.438
Ahsoka, now!

17:55.071 --> 17:56.278
Thanks buddy.

18:01.290 --> 18:02.246
Stop!

18:02.366 --> 18:04.381
The jedi is mie!

18:05.339 --> 18:07.060
Lux, get to the ship.

18:29.321 --> 18:30.960
I guess Artoo made some friends.

19:07.370 --> 19:09.087
Not bad, jedi.

19:09.207 --> 19:11.385
I didn't miss.

19:18.363 --> 19:19.224
Ahsoka!

19:24.526 --> 19:25.999
Don't let them escape!

19:55.006 --> 19:56.619
Yah!

19:56.739 --> 19:58.250
Thanks you Artoo.

20:03.508 --> 20:04.986
Yah!

20:54.091 --> 20:56.667
No one followed us, good job Artoo.

20:58.377 --> 21:00.839
What do you mean the escape pod has been activated?

21:01.784 --> 21:02.552
Lux!

21:02.672 --> 21:04.917
Artoo, the ship is yours.

21:11.483 --> 21:12.122
Lux!

21:12.242 --> 21:13.892
Lux, what're you doing?

21:15.725 --> 21:17.312
I can't go with you, Ahsoka.

21:18.497 --> 21:18.939
You...

21:19.199 --> 21:20.565
You know that.

21:21.034 --> 21:23.134
But--but we can try,

21:23.254 --> 21:26.697
Er... try to change things, together.

21:27.718 --> 21:30.868
We make a pretty good team, are we?

21:33.171 --> 21:34.962
Don't worry. We'll meet again.

21:35.385 --> 21:36.450
I promise.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.097
Be careful, Lux.
