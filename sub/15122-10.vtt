WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:04.305
* Whoo!

00:04.338 --> 00:05.606
* Here we go

00:05.639 --> 00:08.676
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

00:08.709 --> 00:10.744
And here is your change.

00:10.778 --> 00:14.048
Jimmy, Sabrina, I need
your advice on a pickle I'm in.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.283
No, I don't.
Never mind.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.550
Wait! Yes,

00:16.584 --> 00:19.320
I do... I think.
Oh, I don't know.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.655
Shoot a dart at a fart!
I can't decide anything.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.257
(chuckles)
What's going on?

00:23.291 --> 00:25.426
Grocery Palooza's coming up.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.495
It's our annual customer
appreciation event.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.398
Little known fact: we started it
before Lollapalooza.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.433
I still don't think
they stole it from us.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.702
Well, then how else do you
explain it? Anyway, the owners

00:34.735 --> 00:36.704
let me pick the main attraction
from this catalog,

00:36.737 --> 00:37.671
but they're all so good!

00:37.705 --> 00:39.640
Two Buckingham
Palace Guards

00:39.673 --> 00:41.675
that also sing
and do balloon animals;

00:41.709 --> 00:44.112
a horse that can ride a horse;

00:44.145 --> 00:45.579
or Tila Tequila's brother
Vince Vodka.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.415
Gimme.
I've had trouble

00:47.448 --> 00:50.218
making a decision,
ever since that 2007 debacle.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.353
Everybody showed up
to see that band TOTO...

00:52.386 --> 00:54.222
Great band!
That song "Africa"

00:54.255 --> 00:56.557
inspired me to live
in Zaire for five years.

00:56.590 --> 00:57.758
I do not recommend it.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.260
And the show we had here

00:59.293 --> 01:01.195
was also a disappointment.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.297
(booing)

01:07.801 --> 01:09.103
(whistles, cheering)

01:09.137 --> 01:11.705
Normally, I would swoon to see
Wizard of Oz memorabilia,

01:11.739 --> 01:13.274
but that has a time
and a place.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.342
Oh.

01:14.375 --> 01:17.278
Every June in
Chittenango, New York.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.280
JIMMY:
"This porridge is too hot.

01:19.313 --> 01:23.117
"This porridge is too cold."

01:23.151 --> 01:24.352
(groans)

01:26.320 --> 01:28.256
You know, that Goldilocks'd
sure save us a lot of time

01:28.289 --> 01:29.657
by complaining less about the
temperature of the porridge,

01:29.690 --> 01:30.824
and just eating the damn stuff.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.226
Hmm.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.794
*

01:33.827 --> 01:35.863
VIRGINIA:
Hey.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.398
Listen to this.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.800
JIMMY:
"Goldilocks jumped up
from the bed

01:39.833 --> 01:41.402
and ran out of the house."

01:41.435 --> 01:44.238
Really? You're telling me
a whole family of bears

01:44.272 --> 01:45.506
couldn't catch a little girl?

01:45.539 --> 01:48.209
That's dumb.
This is dumb!

01:48.242 --> 01:50.178
The bloom is off the rose
with that baby.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.879
Yeah. Babies are cool,

01:51.912 --> 01:53.747
till you've done everything
there is to do with them.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.516
Then you get bored.

01:55.549 --> 01:58.186
That's why TV shows about babies
never last more than a year.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.453
One of us needs
to talk to him.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.889
I don't want to talk to him
when he's depressed.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.491
He does that "almost cry" thing,

02:03.524 --> 02:05.726
where he wrinkles up his face
and nothing comes out.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.296
It's your turn
to talk to him.
How do you figure?

02:08.329 --> 02:10.564
I talked to him when he stepped
in dog doo, when he was

02:10.598 --> 02:12.733
ten years old, and all the kids
called him "Dog Doo-doo Foot."

02:12.766 --> 02:15.269
And I'm the one that talked to
him when he was the only one

02:15.303 --> 02:17.171
in ninth grade without hair
under his arms, and they all

02:17.205 --> 02:18.906
called him "Smooth Pits
McHairlessness III."

02:18.939 --> 02:21.509
I'm the one that talked to him
when his pants split open

02:21.542 --> 02:22.743
and his whole break-dance team

02:22.776 --> 02:24.278
made fun of his
SpongeBob underwear.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.579
Sadie Hawkins dance,
sophomore year.

02:25.613 --> 02:26.880
Sadie Hawkins dance,
junior year.
Ah...

02:26.914 --> 02:30.418
Fine. I'll talk to him.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.686
Hey! You good?

02:32.720 --> 02:33.821
Pretty good.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.823
Good.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.425
I'm listening.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.793
You get back in there
and stop procras-turbating.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.229
Fine.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.398
All right, Jimmy.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.367
Your mother and I
have tried,

02:46.400 --> 02:48.202
but we can no longer
ignore the fact

02:48.236 --> 02:49.537
that you're bumming hard
about that baby.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.605
Yeah, I love Hope.
I do.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.975
But... she's exhausting,
and frustrating,

02:55.008 --> 02:56.510
and, to tell you
the truth,

02:56.544 --> 02:57.978
she's really, really boring.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.647
Oh, I feel like...

02:59.680 --> 03:02.716
a monster, just saying that.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.353
Maybe I'm not cut out
to be a dad.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.956
Look, I know what you're feeling
right now, and it's normal.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.558
That face you're making
is not normal.

03:10.591 --> 03:11.825
What you're feeling
about Hope:

03:11.859 --> 03:12.926
all normal.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.228
It is?

03:14.262 --> 03:14.962
Oh, sure.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.899
I was miserable
when you came along.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.701
I hated you.
(chuckles)

03:20.734 --> 03:22.370
Really?

03:22.403 --> 03:24.405
You're not just saying that
to make me... feel better?

03:24.438 --> 03:25.939
No!
I hated you.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.941
And I hated myself
for hating you.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.611
And I got so wound up,
I'd start doing weird stuff.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.714
I started rocking...
like this.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.949
Didn't even know
I was doing it.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.818
Thank goodness your mother was
there and kindly pointed it out.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.854
You are a freak!

03:40.888 --> 03:42.923
So, how'd you stop rocking?

03:42.956 --> 03:45.593
Well, that's the cool part.
Get this.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.694
I started rocking.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.763
With my guitar!

03:49.797 --> 03:50.731
Totally mellowed me out.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.366
So you had an outlet.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.602
Yeah, when I used
an electri guitar...

03:54.635 --> 03:55.736
You're missing my
point!

03:55.769 --> 03:57.805
You need to find
a thing of your own.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.373
Something that makes you happy;

03:59.407 --> 04:00.708
get you to stop acting
like a freak.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.477
Thanks, Dad.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.946
You're welcome, son.
Glad we could have this talk.

04:05.979 --> 04:06.880
I love you.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.718
Don't forget,
next one's yours.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.728
Hey, what's all that stuff?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.896
Oh, well, Dad told me to do
something for myself,

04:22.930 --> 04:25.566
and I suck at music,
but I don't suck at art.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.934
So I was drawing on a bag

04:26.967 --> 04:28.001
at the store,
and Barney was so impressed

04:28.035 --> 04:30.304
he asked me to do
the poster for Grocery Palooza.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.306
That's great! You should have
brought the bag home;

04:32.340 --> 04:33.574
we could have stuck it
on the fridge!

04:33.607 --> 04:36.410
Wow!
Glad I could help.

04:36.444 --> 04:39.413
I know. Cool, huh?
Man, being paid to draw.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.782
You know, maybe I can do this
for a job. Maybe I could be

04:41.815 --> 04:43.951
a famous artist.
And even if you can't,

04:43.984 --> 04:46.754
it's cool you got this far.
But maybe I can.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.956
Probably not.
Okay, well,
I'm going to try.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.624
Suit yourself!

05:02.436 --> 05:04.738
Whoo...

05:04.772 --> 05:07.475
"Special super-fantastic
surprise guest."

05:07.508 --> 05:09.343
Yeah, Barney
couldn't decide who to get.

05:09.377 --> 05:11.579
He had finally decided on the
Buckingham Palace Guards,

05:11.612 --> 05:14.081
but they fell through.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.417
Good! If those guys weren't so
busy making public appearances,

05:16.450 --> 05:18.786
maybe Princess Di
would still be alive.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.021
Either way, the poster will be
finished, and that'll be that!

05:21.054 --> 05:23.056
Actually, a school board
member came in the store

05:23.090 --> 05:24.858
and saw me working
on the poster
(clinking silverware)

05:24.892 --> 05:26.560
and get this,
they want to hire me

05:26.594 --> 05:28.729
to paint a mural on the outside
of the high school stadium.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.931
That's great!
It's about time

05:30.964 --> 05:32.500
they painted over
that old mural.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.668
There's got to be a less racist
way to draw an Apache.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.676
Well, that was delicious!
Thanks!

05:42.710 --> 05:45.946
Something's going on.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.781
I cooked that food.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.684
And it is not delicious.

05:53.921 --> 05:54.822
What's that?

05:57.725 --> 05:59.793
Oh, damn it to hell,
he's rocking again. Burt!

05:59.827 --> 06:02.430
Your rocking set off
the motion light.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.532
We can see the Burt signal.

06:04.565 --> 06:08.068
Babe, you haven't rocked
in ages. What is wrong?

06:08.101 --> 06:10.671
Him. He's what's wrong.
What did I do?

06:10.704 --> 06:13.774
You took my advice. Now
everybody's talking about you.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.710
Jimmy!
The guy who draws things

06:16.744 --> 06:18.712
on other things.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.682
You're making something of
yourself, and I never did.
But Dad,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.984
you did. You're a husband,
a father, a grandfather.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.519
You-you built a business.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.988
Blah blah blah,
blabbetty blabbetty blabbetty.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.557
I could have been somebody, too.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.492
What are you talking about?

06:31.525 --> 06:33.126
"Blabbetty blabbetty" means "I
don't care what you're saying."

06:33.160 --> 06:35.429
No. I-I mean about you
being somebody.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.598
I didn't want to just play
guitar in front of my mirror.

06:37.631 --> 06:38.899
I wanted to be in a rock band.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.601
And I could have, too.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.035
I could have gone on tour
with Smokey Floyd.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.572
Burt, that was 20 years ago.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.073
Smokey Floyd.
Wh-why do I know that name?

06:46.106 --> 06:48.476
"Burning Deep Inside"?
(clicks)

06:48.509 --> 06:50.844
* Doesn't matter what I tried

06:50.878 --> 06:54.081
* I still got that
burning deep inside. *

06:54.114 --> 06:56.584
(imitates guitar riff)
Aw, yeah!

06:56.617 --> 06:57.718
That's a hemorrhoid commercial!

06:57.751 --> 06:59.052
It was a hit song first!

06:59.086 --> 07:01.188
And I could have been
in his band.
It's true.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.957
They all called your father
the white Stevie Ray Vaughan.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.726
(chuckles)

07:05.759 --> 07:07.595
We didn't know Stevie Ray
Vaughan was white back then.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.463
We didn't have a very good TV.

07:09.497 --> 07:12.165
Smokey came through town.
I had an audition.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.233
* Bang your head...

07:13.266 --> 07:15.102
Smokey Floyd was in the middle

07:15.135 --> 07:17.037
of his Smoke Gets
in Your Everything tour

07:17.070 --> 07:18.572
when he rolled into town.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.541
He had an awesome bus,
killer hair,

07:20.574 --> 07:22.876
and pants so tight,
he eventually lost a testicle.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.479
He was a god,

07:25.513 --> 07:28.148
but what he didn't have
was a guitar player,

07:28.181 --> 07:31.118
so every wannabe rocker
showed up to try out.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.488
Since your mom had detention
that day, I had you.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.156
First, I got a few rules.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.991
Number one-- you must be able

07:38.025 --> 07:40.060
to fit into Donnie's
leather pants,

07:40.093 --> 07:42.796
so if you're not a 32-34,
get the hell out of here.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.600
Rule two-- you must be able

07:46.634 --> 07:48.769
to carry 180 pounds
of dead weight

07:48.802 --> 07:50.671
to the nearest hospital.

07:54.174 --> 07:57.044
Rule number three-- you must be
willing to shave your body

07:57.077 --> 07:59.279
from the neck down,
'cause when you're on tour,

07:59.312 --> 08:02.816
one dude gets crabs,
we all get crabs.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.718
(men grumbling and murmuring)

08:06.286 --> 08:08.155
All right.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.990
Strap on your axes.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.158
Let's see which
one of you is...

08:11.191 --> 08:12.526
(exhales air)

08:12.560 --> 08:14.294
...Smoke worthy.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.930
(baby crying)

08:16.964 --> 08:17.965
Is that a baby?

08:19.032 --> 08:20.768
(crying continues)

08:20.801 --> 08:22.703
Who brought a baby?!

08:22.736 --> 08:24.104
* Bang your head...

08:24.137 --> 08:27.174
There's no babies in
rock and roll, man.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.611
What kind of idiot
brings a baby?!

08:30.644 --> 08:31.779
Oh. It was my fault?

08:31.812 --> 08:33.013
Short answer-- yes.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.548
Burt, are you out
of your mind?

08:34.582 --> 08:35.683
He was just a baby.

08:35.716 --> 08:36.650
Mom, it's okay.

08:36.684 --> 08:37.951
No, your mom's right.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.086
You're doing great things,

08:39.119 --> 08:40.220
and here I am thinking
only of myself.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.623
Look, my life is fine.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.792
I don't need
to be a famous musician.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.627
Just would have been nice
to be known

08:46.660 --> 08:48.195
for something other
than being the pool guy.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.630
You are more
than just a pool guy.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.831
You're a husband,

08:50.864 --> 08:51.999
a father, a
grandfather...

08:52.032 --> 08:54.868
Blah blah blah,
blabbetty blabbetty.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.606
Wait a second. What was
that guy's name again?

08:58.639 --> 08:59.773
Smokey Floyd?

08:59.807 --> 09:00.540
Yeah.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.047
Miss.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.150
Aah!

09:10.183 --> 09:12.219
Miss, but you did land
in between the girl

09:12.252 --> 09:14.187
that used to play Kimmy
Gibbler on Full House

09:14.221 --> 09:16.023
and the dog that
barks the alphabet.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.658
Oh, damn it!

09:17.691 --> 09:20.894
This is turning out to be harder
than just picking one.

09:20.928 --> 09:21.962
(whimpers)
Geez.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.296
(panting)

09:23.330 --> 09:25.866
Barney. Oh.
I think I've got your act.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.135
Ah, da-da, da-da, da.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.803
Yes.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.808
*

09:34.842 --> 09:36.009
(phone line ringing)

09:36.043 --> 09:39.179
This is Smokey. Talk.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.882
Lollapalooza?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.851
No, no, no.
Grocery Palooza.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.019
Yup, yup,
it's just like Lollapalooza,

09:46.053 --> 09:47.821
but with groceries
instead of, um... Lollas.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.690
But we were first.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.058
When is it?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.693
Uh, Saturday night.
I know it's short notice,

09:52.726 --> 09:53.794
and you're probably busy, but

09:53.827 --> 09:54.962
we'd really appreciate it.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.930
I'm gonna check my calendar.

09:56.964 --> 09:57.798
(whispers):
He's checking his calendar.
Okay.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.640
I'm gonna need a sweet dressing
room, bottled water

10:06.674 --> 10:08.809
and brand-name
chewable fiber pills.

10:08.842 --> 10:09.943
He's in.
Ah! Yes!

10:09.977 --> 10:11.078
(laughs)
Thank you so...

10:11.111 --> 10:12.646
Thank you so much, Mr. Floyd.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.815
We are thrilled to have you.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.317
Why, yes, we do have
lots of hot chicks around here.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.787
I'm looking at one right now.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.755
Well, I-I-I've never,
uh, noticed.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.223
Uh, Sabrina,
could you hop down

10:23.256 --> 10:24.858
and, uh,
turn around for a second?

10:24.892 --> 10:25.793
No.

10:25.826 --> 10:26.827
I seem to recall

10:26.860 --> 10:28.095
it's pretty firm.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.206
Dude, I'm sorry the cream

10:39.239 --> 10:40.440
didn't work for your buttage,

10:40.473 --> 10:42.375
but I don't make the stuff,
all right?

10:42.409 --> 10:44.945
If your burning is as deep
inside as you say it is,

10:44.978 --> 10:45.913
I'd get to a doctor.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.782
Uh, Smokey Floyd?

10:48.816 --> 10:49.850
Settle down.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.925
Now you're smokin'.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.259
(exhales)

11:01.394 --> 11:03.430
So, uh, what do
you want for breakfast?

11:03.463 --> 11:05.699
We have like

11:05.733 --> 11:07.000
six types of cereal.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.301
Ooh, and, uh,

11:08.335 --> 11:10.437
you can have the big bowl, too.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.706
Me and my dad usually
fight over that.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.307
So what's the lineup?

11:14.341 --> 11:16.109
Am I opening or closing?

11:16.143 --> 11:17.010
Both, actually.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.713
Huh.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.114
So you have your own silverware.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.415
You have to.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.051
Putting things in your mouth

11:24.084 --> 11:25.352
that were in
other people's mouths,

11:25.385 --> 11:26.954
no matter how you wash it,
it's nasty.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.291
You don't put the bowl
up to your mouth, do you?

11:31.324 --> 11:33.493
Ooh, uh, no.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.295
Mm. You're lying.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.297
Nuke this for 40 seconds.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.968
So it's a grocery store,
right?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.402
What, like a big
parking lot thing?

11:42.435 --> 11:43.804
Uh, the produce section.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.005
Who's backing me up?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.807
A bunch of local hotshots?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.175
Uh, just a guitar player.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.910
But he's one of the best around.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.044
Very polished and professional.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.351
(whimpers)

11:58.385 --> 11:59.987
Excuse me.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.456
What the hell is going on?

12:03.490 --> 12:05.793
Smokey Floyd is in my kitchen!

12:05.826 --> 12:07.327
Smokey Floyd is
in our kitchen.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.797
And guess what? He's going
to be playing Grocery Palooza.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.198
Oh, my God!

12:11.231 --> 12:12.866
Wait. It gets better.

12:12.900 --> 12:13.901
You're going to be playing
with him.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.435
Shut the front door!

12:15.468 --> 12:17.204
No, seriously, shut the front
door. I'm freaking out.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.438
I don't want him to hear me.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.876
Dad, I might have
cost you your chance

12:22.910 --> 12:24.945
to play guitar with your
hero a long time ago,

12:24.978 --> 12:27.781
but I got it back for you.
And after today,

12:27.815 --> 12:30.918
no one in this town will
ever think of you as just
being the pool guy anymore.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.823
I love you so much, son.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.291
I love you too, Dad, but can
we just say it from now on?

12:38.325 --> 12:40.093
I'm not making any promises.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.094
Take off your pants.

12:45.565 --> 12:48.568
Oh, my God.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.469
It's you...

12:49.502 --> 12:50.971
Take some breaths, sweetheart.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.174
The shock will fade.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.544
But luckily, the memory
will last forever.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.912
(blowing)

12:58.946 --> 13:02.049
(moaning, sighing)

13:02.082 --> 13:03.550
Smokey Floyd.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.120
In my kitchen.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.388
Hey, that's
a nice spoon.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.590
Where'd you get that spoon?

13:10.623 --> 13:13.560
Hey, what's up, Smoke?

13:13.593 --> 13:16.063
Burt Chance.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.865
I almost auditioned
for you 20 years ago

13:17.898 --> 13:19.066
when Donnie died.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.467
Donnie didn't die.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.535
He just got too fat
for his leather pants.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.972
He's a court reporter
up in Fresno now.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.339
Weighs like 300 pounds.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.607
We're Facebook friends.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.109
That's a thing I have
on my computer.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.278
Anyway, I am a huge fan,

13:31.311 --> 13:34.147
and I'm going to be
backing you up tonight.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.119
And if you don't mind,

13:39.152 --> 13:41.154
we kind of have assigned seats
around here for breakfast. So...

13:56.269 --> 13:58.305
He's eating the same
cereal I pick.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.915
(feedback squeals)

14:15.355 --> 14:17.490
Smokey...

14:19.492 --> 14:20.961
You're welcome.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.298
Ah, yes.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.067
I see your future
very clearly.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.336
You're gonna save 50 cents
on a 12 pack of English muffins.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.409
You're gonna die
in a plane crash.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.978
(laughing)

14:38.011 --> 14:39.179
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.614
You're gonna save 50 cents
on a 12 pack of English muffins.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.384
Hey, where's Dad?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.053
Oh, he's around here somewhere.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.487
I better go make sure
he's getting ready.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.989
Can you watch Hope?
Hmm.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.590
Hey, great job with the store.

14:50.623 --> 14:54.161
And I am loving
these free cupcakes.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.262
Those are six dollars a box.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.242
Uh, Dad?

15:09.276 --> 15:11.411
Hey, ooh, what are you
doing in here?

15:11.444 --> 15:12.712
Go away, please.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.015
But it's almost
time for the...
Just go away.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.284
Well, will you at least
just look at me?
I can't.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.386
My head is stuck
on this shelf.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.422
I felt like I needed to rock,
and I didn't want anyone to see.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.657
I was sweating, and I
rocked under this shelf

15:24.691 --> 15:26.259
and my head got stuck.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.095
Here, let me just help...
Don't touch it!

15:28.128 --> 15:29.396
I got it. I'm fine.

15:30.663 --> 15:31.698
(grunts)

15:31.731 --> 15:34.201
Oh!

15:34.234 --> 15:36.069
Why were you rocking?
Are you mad at me again?

15:36.103 --> 15:37.270
No.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.338
I got nervous.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.572
I can't go on stage, Jimmy.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.740
You've got to go on.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.741
What if I suck?

15:41.774 --> 15:43.210
But you won't suck.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.577
But what if I do?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.279
Jimmy, I spent 20 years

15:46.313 --> 15:48.315
blaming you for me
not being a rock star.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.617
If I go suck on
stage, it's just...

15:50.650 --> 15:53.020
I got nobody to
blame but myself.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.521
I get that. I do.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.156
But you also spent 20 years

15:56.189 --> 15:58.591
being known as
a yard and pool guy.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.327
And I think I remember
you saying you wanted

16:00.360 --> 16:02.029
to be known for something more.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.997
You can do this, Dad.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.398
I know you can.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.467
And if you don't,
I'll still love you,

16:07.500 --> 16:09.236
but you got to try.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.275
Do not kiss me on the lips.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.511
Then stop saying stuff
that makes me want to.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.050
All right, everybody--

16:23.083 --> 16:26.519
when I say "Grocery,"
you say "Palooza."

16:26.553 --> 16:28.321
Grocery...

16:30.057 --> 16:33.660
Okay, now how about a big
Grocery Palooza welcome

16:33.693 --> 16:35.295
for Smokey Floyd

16:35.328 --> 16:36.763
and the Smokey Floyd Band!

16:36.796 --> 16:39.466
(scattered applause)

16:46.306 --> 16:47.407
Thanks, Kenny.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.008
It-it's Barney.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.279
Hello, Natesville.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.647
Whoo! Smokey Floyd.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.316
And I'm the Smokey Floyd Band.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.184
Ow!

16:58.418 --> 17:01.488
One, two, one, two,
three, four...

17:01.521 --> 17:02.822
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.691
Could you just grab me
two tomatoes there, please?

17:04.724 --> 17:06.226
No, no, no, no.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.160
Not those. Those.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.761
Mm-hmm.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.097
Oh, no, baby, this one
is mushy.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.166
Thank you, baby.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.235
We all set?

17:15.268 --> 17:16.636
One, two,

17:16.669 --> 17:18.305
one, two, three, four.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.474
(strumming chords)

17:32.252 --> 17:36.055
* I've got a burnin'
deep inside *

17:37.857 --> 17:42.129
* After all these tears
I've cried *
(Hope crying)

17:44.631 --> 17:47.234
* Doesn't matter
what I've got... *

17:47.267 --> 17:49.402
(crying continues)

17:49.436 --> 17:50.437
(microphone feedback squeaks)
A baby?

17:50.470 --> 17:51.338
A baby.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.839
What kind of idiot

17:52.872 --> 17:55.408
brings a baby
to a rock concert, man?

17:55.442 --> 17:57.777
I'm sorry.
She loves the music.

17:57.810 --> 17:58.745
Good for her, man.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.880
Good... for her!

18:00.913 --> 18:02.249
Think.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.450
You think babies
and rock and roll

18:03.483 --> 18:04.784
music mix?

18:04.817 --> 18:07.287
You see a lot
of babies on MTV?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.689
Actually, there's that show,
16 and Pregnant.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.691
And Teen Mom.
I saw an episode
of True Life

18:11.724 --> 18:12.692
called "I've Got
Baby Mama Drama."

18:13.926 --> 18:14.761
She's good.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.463
Hey!

18:16.496 --> 18:18.665
Who put my autographed melon
back on the shelf?

18:18.698 --> 18:20.533
You guys have any idea
who I am?

18:20.567 --> 18:22.702
Would you
just play the
song, please?

18:22.735 --> 18:25.138
Just play the song, please.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.840
No, you don't tell me
how to do my job, sister.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.143
I don't tell you how
to bring a trucker

18:30.177 --> 18:32.712
a tuna melt at whatever greasy
spoon you probably work at.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.147
I am not a waitress.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.282
I'm a maid.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.583
JIMMY:
She tried

18:36.616 --> 18:38.685
waiting tables, but she couldn't
add up the math.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.620
Well, why are you telling him
that? Don't tell him that.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.921
SMOKEY:
Great. So I'm performing

18:41.954 --> 18:44.391
for a bunch of idiots
who can't even add!

18:44.424 --> 18:45.725
I can add.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.528
Just have a little trouble
with percents. Thanks.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.430
(crying)
SMOKEY:
Here we go again

18:50.463 --> 18:51.664
with the baby.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.533
You people realize how

18:53.566 --> 18:54.767
beneath me
this whole thing is?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.170
Playing some
produce section

18:57.204 --> 18:58.605
with some schmuck

18:58.638 --> 19:00.907
who skims pools
for a living?

19:00.940 --> 19:03.410
I'm Smokey Floyd, people.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.445
Smokey "The Doctor of Rock"

19:05.478 --> 19:06.946
frickin' Floyd.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.215
(audience gasping)

19:09.582 --> 19:11.351
(thudding)

19:13.620 --> 19:17.390
Smoke on that, jerk.

19:17.424 --> 19:18.325
(gasps)

19:18.358 --> 19:21.361
(applause and cheering)

19:25.365 --> 19:28.368
* Metal health will
drive you mad *

19:28.401 --> 19:30.903
* Bang your head...

19:36.909 --> 19:38.678
JIMMY:
Look at you.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.980
Now, we're almost at the end,
and you're still up.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.815
Somebody likes
the picture book Daddy made.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.617
And when the mean dragon

19:44.651 --> 19:46.286
flew in from out of town

19:46.319 --> 19:48.855
and attacked
the Village Market Palooza,

19:48.888 --> 19:50.357
Brave Burthew

19:50.390 --> 19:51.924
took his magic guitar,

19:51.958 --> 19:53.626
turned it into an ax,

19:53.660 --> 19:55.462
and took the dragon down.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.897
And the people were saved.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.599
"Ah! Yeah!"

19:59.632 --> 20:01.834
And all the village
was talking about Burthew.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.636
Smokey Floyd had only one hit.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.405
It was called "Burning Pain,"

20:05.438 --> 20:08.508
and for some concertgoers,
that's exactly what he was.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.510
Good for her, man.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.945
Good... for her.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.747
But the tables were turned

20:14.781 --> 20:16.716
as musician
and local business owner

20:16.749 --> 20:19.018
Burt Chance became
a guitar hero.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.219
Oof!

20:22.655 --> 20:25.325
JIMMY: And songs were made
in his honor.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.260
(over computer):
* Tuna melt
* Tuna melt... *

20:27.294 --> 20:29.362
I don't know who did it,
but it's got 22,000 hits.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.863
(hip-hop plays)
Good for her.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.865
I'm Smokey Floyd.
Smokey Floyd.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.301
I'm Smokey Floyd. Floyd...

20:34.334 --> 20:35.602
But the tables were turned.

20:35.635 --> 20:39.038
* Smoke on that, jerk

20:39.071 --> 20:40.940
* Smoke
on that, jerk *

20:40.973 --> 20:42.775
Burt Chance.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.911
* Smoke on that, jerk

20:44.944 --> 20:47.280
Guitar hero.
* Smoke on that, jerk

20:47.314 --> 20:50.317
* Smoke
on that, jerk. *

20:50.350 --> 20:51.718
Burt Chance, guitar hero.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.487
(applause)

20:56.022 --> 20:58.625
JIMMY:
Burthew also discovered
he wasn't the only one

20:58.658 --> 20:59.726
in the neighborhood
with hidden talents.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.595
*

21:02.629 --> 21:03.863
Hey, man?

21:05.365 --> 21:06.533
Aren't you that dude

21:06.566 --> 21:07.767
that beat down that dude?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.035
Rock on, dude.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.071
Smoke on that, jerk.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.440
Yeah.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.943
Yeah.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.278
JIMMY: He was Burthew,
the grass cutter...

21:21.348 --> 21:23.783
who slayed a dragon,

21:23.816 --> 21:24.984
and he lived happier

21:25.017 --> 21:26.453
ever after.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.029
CHILD:
Come back next week
for more Hope.
