<i> There's so much that</i>
<i> what I'm going through,</i>

1:01:41.665 --> 1:01:43.598
<i> and I want people to just</i>
<i> learn from my story, right?</i>

1:01:43.667 --> 1:01:45.734
<i> Like, if I can do it,</i>
<i> you can do it.</i>

1:01:45.803 --> 1:01:47.436
<i> To all the younger women</i>
<i> out there,</i>

1:01:47.504 --> 1:01:51.640
if I can do it, you can do it.
Never give up.

1:01:51.709 --> 1:01:53.141
<i> - ♪ Loving every minute ♪</i>

1:01:53.210 --> 1:01:58.513
<i> ♪ 'Cause you make me feel</i>
<i> so alive, alive ♪</i>

1:01:58.582 --> 1:02:00.849
<i> - Look, every time at the end</i>
<i> of a "Challenge,"</i>

1:02:00.918 --> 1:02:02.184
<i> I'm done, I say it,</i>

1:02:02.252 --> 1:02:04.119
<i> I'm gonna ride off</i>
<i> in the sunset.</i>

1:02:04.188 --> 1:02:09.091
A couple months go by,
I get that call from TJ,

1:02:09.159 --> 1:02:11.626
and start to miss it
a little bit.

1:02:11.695 --> 1:02:13.028
[sighs]

1:02:13.097 --> 1:02:14.396
I can't help it. I love it.

1:02:14.465 --> 1:02:18.900

1:02:18.969 --> 1:02:20.802

1:02:33.317 --> 1:02:35.283
- You thrive in negativity.

1:02:35.352 --> 1:02:36.752
- You don't go around
talking [bleep] about me, Tori.

1:02:36.820 --> 1:02:39.187
Just 'cause you don't tweet it
doesn't mean you don't say it.

1:02:39.256 --> 1:02:41.857
- I'm not like you!
I don't live for social media!

1:02:41.925 --> 1:02:44.126
- I didn't even know what
this girl was being faced.

1:02:44.194 --> 1:02:45.627
- CT, what do you think
would happen

1:02:45.696 --> 1:02:46.962
if you faced Boz?

1:02:47.030 --> 1:02:49.464
- I think I'd punch
his head in.

1:02:49.533 --> 1:02:50.565
- No, no, no, no.

1:02:50.634 --> 1:02:51.933
You don't wanna be treated
like a dog,

1:02:52.002 --> 1:02:53.201
then don't act like one.
