00:10.512 --> 00:17.310
<i>NARRATOR". We have already seen
the great maestro of the keyboard, Chandell.</i>

00:19.062 --> 00:22.232
<i>Attacked by phantoms at Wayne Manor.</i>

00:23.149 --> 00:24.692
<i>Catastrophe.</i>

00:24.901 --> 00:28.988
<i>Batman on vacation, out of touch.</i>

00:29.822 --> 00:32.825
<i>Chandell demand protection.</i>

00:33.451 --> 00:39.123
<i>Tricky Chandell,
who was also the criminal fingers.</i>

00:40.041 --> 00:44.921
<i>Blackmailed into a life of crime
by twin brother Harry.</i>

00:46.464 --> 00:48.758
<i>Police precautions at a concert.</i>

00:50.218 --> 00:55.265
<i>In vain, Chandell struck
by a remote piano control.</i>

00:55.682 --> 01:01.688
<i>But wait, way off in the wilderness,
Bruce Wayne hears a false note.</i>

01:02.689 --> 01:04.399
<i>A call to Dick Grayson.</i>

01:05.858 --> 01:08.820
<i>Chandell in hot pursuit.</i>

01:09.529 --> 01:13.241
<i>Why, what could he be up to?</i>

01:14.325 --> 01:16.494
<i>A false attack.</i>

01:17.912 --> 01:20.248
<i>A devilish clue.</i>

01:21.958 --> 01:23.960
<i>Into a trap.</i>

01:25.044 --> 01:30.300
<i>The Dynamic Duo about to be perforated
into human piano rolls.</i>

01:31.759 --> 01:34.887
<i>Disaster. Which way out?</i>

01:35.805 --> 01:42.395
<i>The most dreadful music is yet to come
in just one minute.</i>

02:54.384 --> 02:56.803
Holy metronome, what a fate.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.888
Punched into player piano rolls.

02:59.097 --> 03:02.058
True, Robin, scarcely an end
I'd ever anticipated.

03:02.266 --> 03:06.145
Life, a cupful of surprises to the last drop.

03:06.354 --> 03:10.191
- See any way out, Batman?
-Frankly, from this perspective, no.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.860
- Wait a minute.
-A minute's too long.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.987
My toes are almost in the puncher.

03:15.196 --> 03:18.908
Robin, with every ounce of breath
that's left in you...

03:19.117 --> 03:20.910
...sing along with me.

03:21.119 --> 03:22.203
Sing what?

03:22.412 --> 03:26.457
Don t ask questions, Robin.
Sing each note precisely as I do.

03:26.666 --> 03:28.000
When I sing, you sing.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.585
Ready, Robin? Sing.

03:40.555 --> 03:43.808
Will that terrible sound never stop?

03:44.016 --> 03:46.853
Death squeals of a brace of bats.

03:57.113 --> 03:59.449
Nice singing, Robin.

03:59.657 --> 04:01.117
It saved our lives.

04:01.325 --> 04:02.994
Holy Caruso, how?

04:03.202 --> 04:05.204
Observe how this machine works.

04:05.663 --> 04:08.916
Music from the master piano
is picked up by this microphone...

04:09.125 --> 04:13.588
...and transmitted to the perforating cylinders
which reproduce the chords perfectly.

04:13.796 --> 04:16.007
We outshouted the piano, don't you see?

04:16.214 --> 04:18.301
How come we didn't get punched
full of holes?

04:18.509 --> 04:20.428
Because of the notes I selected.

04:20.636 --> 04:25.933
They were calculated to make the punches fall
precisely around the outlines of our bodies.

04:26.142 --> 04:28.186
I visualized the chords in my mind.

04:28.394 --> 04:29.896
Holy perfect pitch.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.522
Yes, it's useful sometimes.

04:31.731 --> 04:33.941
However, no time for self-congratulation.

04:34.150 --> 04:37.570
- Let's burst in and bag those birds.
-Roger.

04:37.779 --> 04:40.823
Poor bats, they squeak no more.

04:43.534 --> 04:46.120
Truly spoken...

04:46.329 --> 04:48.581
...you vile criminal twin.

04:49.624 --> 04:51.542
Girls, run for your lives.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.928
<i>- I'll</i> round up those crooked cookies.
- No, Robin, wait.

05:04.430 --> 05:05.598
Batman to police.

05:05.807 --> 05:08.392
There's a knocked-out criminal
at 20-B Front Street.

05:08.601 --> 05:12.605
Zip code 9999979.

05:12.814 --> 05:14.982
Come, pick him up. Batman out.

05:15.191 --> 05:17.902
Holy fugitives, you mean
we're gonna let those girls go?

05:18.110 --> 05:21.197
Yes, Robin, as part of a plan.

05:23.115 --> 05:27.620
The infamy of it, attacking your own brother,
the great artist Chandell, with a root beer bottle.

05:27.829 --> 05:29.747
- What's behind all this?
-I don't know.

05:29.956 --> 05:32.250
All right, canary, start talking.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.669
It's somebody called Fingers.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.879
- Fingers?
-Yeah, he's behind it all.

05:37.088 --> 05:41.133
He's got a plot to get his mitts on the entire
fortune of millionaire Bruce Wayne.

05:41.342 --> 05:44.387
Okay, pal, button up.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.681
My name is Alfred Slye, sir.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.683
I'm a noted criminal attorney.

05:48.891 --> 05:52.728
Very incautious of you to begin this
interrogation without my presence, wasn't it?

05:52.937 --> 05:54.397
Chief.

05:56.399 --> 05:59.193
A most unwelcome arrival.
The fellow was beginning to talk.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.405
- Want me to toss the mouthpiece out?
-Heaven forbid, Chief O'Hara.

06:02.572 --> 06:04.991
In today's climate,
that could land us behind bars.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.325
Then what'll we do?

06:06.534 --> 06:10.538
Patience and subtlety,
the honest policeman's only aids.

06:11.289 --> 06:13.332
Turn up the lights a notch.

06:14.125 --> 06:16.377
No law against making this villain sweat.

06:17.461 --> 06:20.756
Excuse us, it was a trifle dark in here.

06:22.592 --> 06:24.677
Here you are, pal.

06:30.266 --> 06:32.560
- That's too much.
-indeed.

06:32.768 --> 06:36.856
Talk about crude, naked police brutality.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

06:37.023 --> 06:38.774
Are you gonna charge my client
or aren't you?

06:38.983 --> 06:42.486
I hereby charge him with a felonious attempt
to perforate the Dynamic Duo...

06:42.653 --> 06:44.697
...into player piano music rolls,
-Ha, ha.

06:44.906 --> 06:47.950
Very amusing. Where are your witnesses?

06:48.159 --> 06:50.369
- Witnesses?
-I order a countercharge, sir.

06:50.578 --> 06:53.623
I accuse Batman and Robin
of malicious mischief.

06:53.831 --> 06:57.251
To wit, the damage of a licensed
perforating machine...

06:57.460 --> 06:59.712
...by introducing foreign objects into same.

06:59.921 --> 07:02.173
Said objects being themselves.

07:02.381 --> 07:03.424
Saints alive.

07:03.633 --> 07:06.135
The world's gone mad,
the whole planet lunatic.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.262
Come along, Harry.

07:08.471 --> 07:12.516
You don't have to listen to this raving.

07:16.729 --> 07:21.525
A new super-criminal with a plan
for getting the entire Wayne fortune.

07:21.734 --> 07:27.865
To put it pithily,
this Fingers fits like a glove.

07:28.074 --> 07:29.116
Fits what, Batman?

07:29.325 --> 07:32.411
The musical theme that's run
through this entire affair.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.915
Holy greed, how could a crook hope
to get ahold of the Wayne fortune?

07:36.123 --> 07:38.417
A good question, Robin, pursue it.

07:38.626 --> 07:42.505
It's impossible, Batman, your assets
are tied up by a hundred ironclad trusts.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.256
Precisely.

07:44.465 --> 07:50.137
At the risk of alarming you,
I can see only one...

07:50.346 --> 07:54.141
What would happen
to Bruce Wayne's fortune...

07:54.767 --> 07:57.687
...if he suffered a fatal accident?

07:57.853 --> 08:02.233
Gosh, I guess I,
Dick Grayson, would inherit it.

08:02.817 --> 08:04.151
Right again.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.905
And if Dick's life were snuffed out
in that same accident?

08:08.114 --> 08:09.740
It would all go to Aunt Harriet.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.242
Um, excuse me, sir.

08:11.450 --> 08:14.537
Will you be wishing my services
for the next few hours?

08:14.745 --> 08:16.747
Not that I know about, Alfred, why?

08:16.956 --> 08:19.917
Mrs. Cooper has requested me
to drive her into the city, sir.

08:20.126 --> 08:24.505
It appears she has
another, um, ahem, secret rendezvous...

08:24.714 --> 08:28.384
...with the Maestro Chandell
in his dressing room, sir...

08:28.592 --> 08:33.764
...atop the Gotham City Town Hall.
Good day, sir.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.850
Holy Bluebeard.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.977
You mean Fingers and Chandell
are the same guy?

08:39.186 --> 08:42.732
I fear it's a dreadful probability.

08:43.232 --> 08:45.860
He's gonna bump us off
in our guise of Bruce and Dick...

08:46.068 --> 08:48.446
...then vamp Aunt Harriet,
marry the Wayne fortune.

08:48.654 --> 08:51.365
A clever and diabolical scheme.

08:51.574 --> 08:55.911
This Chandell is a deucedly attractive fellow.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.705
He could pull it off.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.165
Gosh, Batman.

08:59.373 --> 09:02.585
How could a man like Chandell,
the world's greatest pianist...

09:02.793 --> 09:05.671
...take up a life of murderous crime?

09:05.880 --> 09:09.425
I think I've guessed that too, Robin.

09:11.302 --> 09:17.224
Close your eyes. Summon up every ounce
of your super-keen musical memory.

09:18.350 --> 09:22.730
Okay, Batman, my eyes are shut,
I'm summoning.

09:23.314 --> 09:27.943
Remember that concert Chandell gave
at the White House some time ago?

09:28.152 --> 09:31.072
We listened to it together, you recall?

09:31.280 --> 09:34.241
Sure, that was the concert
which made him famous.

09:34.450 --> 09:35.701
I remember every note.

09:36.035 --> 09:37.161
Excellent.

09:37.369 --> 09:41.832
Concentrate on the andante passage
in his first selection...

09:42.041 --> 09:44.960
...about the 12th bar...

09:45.169 --> 09:50.091
...from the top of page 17 of the score.

09:50.299 --> 09:53.135
I'm with you. Page 17.

09:53.344 --> 09:54.845
Listen to it.

09:55.054 --> 09:59.141
Savor the maestro's interpretation.

09:59.350 --> 10:02.561
Oh, beautiful.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.480
Such feeling.

10:04.688 --> 10:05.981
And I recall, he--

10:07.650 --> 10:08.984
Holy Paderewski.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.487
Good boy, Robin. You've caught it.

10:11.695 --> 10:14.782
It was exactly the same
as the Paderewski version.

10:14.990 --> 10:19.495
So exactly
that I can draw only one conclusion.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.081
He used a player piano at that concert...

10:22.289 --> 10:25.709
...with the music roll
cut by Paderewski himself.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.795
Precisely.

10:28.003 --> 10:34.218
A roll undoubtedly secured from
twin brother Harry's music roll factory.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.762
To the Batmobile.

10:38.389 --> 10:42.601
<i>Come let us stroll down lover's lane</i>

10:43.602 --> 10:48.440
<i>And let me kiss you once again</i>

10:49.316 --> 10:52.069
<i>Soon we must say:</i>

10:52.236 --> 10:55.322
<i>"Auf wiedersehen</i>

10:55.906 --> 10:59.827
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, my dear"</i>

11:02.413 --> 11:07.293
<i>I know my heart won't beat again</i>

11:07.459 --> 11:11.505
<i>Until the day we meet again</i>

11:13.841 --> 11:16.552
<i>Sweetheart, goodbye</i>

11:16.719 --> 11:19.638
<i>Auf wiedersehen</i>

11:19.805 --> 11:25.394
<i>Auf wiedersehen, my dear</i>

11:31.275 --> 11:33.903
The softness of these hands...

11:34.111 --> 11:38.324
...are made mindful of a night moth's wings.

11:38.532 --> 11:42.369
Oh, you're simply a poet, maestro.

11:42.578 --> 11:46.999
Like a night moth's wings, they're dusted.

11:47.208 --> 11:51.253
Dusted with the stuff
that dreams are made of.

11:51.462 --> 11:54.048
Oh, Chandell.

12:02.306 --> 12:03.849
Oh, Chandell.

12:04.058 --> 12:05.768
The masher, I'll fix him.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.938
Hold it, old chum.
We mustn't give ourselves away.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.815
Self-control is sure tough
sometimes, Batman.

12:12.024 --> 12:15.736
All virtues are, old chum.
Indeed, that's why they're virtues.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.948
However, all philosophy aside...

12:20.115 --> 12:25.371
...it looks like Chandell has Aunt Harriet
quite thoroughly in his fingers...

12:25.579 --> 12:27.456
...so to speak...

12:27.665 --> 12:31.752
...which isn't a bad thing, Robin.

12:32.544 --> 12:36.465
It sets the stage for our next startling move.

12:36.674 --> 12:39.343
- What, Batman?
-Back to Wayne Manor...

12:39.551 --> 12:42.680
...to that photographic darkroom
we built in the hall closet.

12:42.888 --> 12:45.307
I have a little plan of my own.

12:54.858 --> 12:59.029
Good heavens. Mr. Bruce? Master Dick?

13:03.242 --> 13:07.454
Fantastic. I couldn't have arranged it
any better myself.

13:07.663 --> 13:10.332
Are you going to marry her,
Chandell, darling?

13:10.541 --> 13:12.293
Of course, I'll marry her.

13:12.501 --> 13:16.714
Then I'll sneak 5 million
out of our joint checking account...

13:16.922 --> 13:20.175
...and pay off
my blackmailing brother, Harry.

13:20.384 --> 13:24.096
Imagine, farewell, Chandell.

13:24.305 --> 13:29.184
I'll cast off my criminal skin
like a molting butterfly.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.437
Hold the phone, butterfly.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.565
After you marry that rich old dame,
where does that leave us?

13:34.773 --> 13:36.525
We've slaved for you, Chandell.

13:36.734 --> 13:41.113
We've given you the best years
of our criminal lives.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.741
Dear Doe...

13:43.949 --> 13:46.118
...ravishing Rae...

13:46.327 --> 13:48.203
...marvelous Mimi...

13:48.412 --> 13:51.248
...you don't dream I'd cast you off, I hope.

13:51.457 --> 13:53.292
I have plans for you.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.836
I'll bet you do.

13:58.964 --> 14:01.133
Oh, my ears.

14:06.597 --> 14:07.639
Hey, kiddies.

14:09.767 --> 14:11.643
What's going on here?

14:11.852 --> 14:16.023
That genius twin brother of yours,
I had to cool him, Harry.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.567
Take our word, he's planning to go straight.

14:18.776 --> 14:20.319
And double-cross us all.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.321
Wouldn't surprise me a bit.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.239
He never was much good.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.574
Mr. Slye?

14:25.783 --> 14:27.242
Yes, amigo?

14:27.451 --> 14:30.120
A legal question.

14:34.291 --> 14:37.252
Say this Cooper dame
does marry this boob...

14:37.461 --> 14:40.714
...how long before the will is settled
and he gets the dough?

14:40.923 --> 14:43.008
Considering the crowded state
of our courts...

14:43.217 --> 14:45.803
...I'd say about 11 years.
-Eleven years?

14:46.178 --> 14:50.808
With the Dynamic Duo on our tails,
we'll be lucky if we last 11 hours.

14:51.016 --> 14:55.729
Which reminds me, Harry, my bill
for springing you from the hoosegow.

14:56.355 --> 14:58.941
A hundred thousand bucks,
payable by midnight tonight...

14:59.149 --> 15:02.111
...or else ethics demand
that I turn you back in.

15:02.319 --> 15:06.281
You're a charming fellow, Mr. Slye.

15:06.490 --> 15:11.662
I'm a criminal attorney.
It says so on my letterhead.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.670
Music, dreamboat.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.427
No, no, please!

15:31.890 --> 15:34.768
Dig out that costume of my twin brother's...

15:34.977 --> 15:38.063
...the one he wore
at Queen Elizabeth's coronation.

15:38.272 --> 15:41.400
I've just thought of a beautiful new plan.

15:43.444 --> 15:47.364
When that awful explosion
happened, they were--

15:48.824 --> 15:52.035
They were enlarging a photograph of me.

15:52.411 --> 15:58.792
<i>Sweet Harriet, please,
don't engulf yourself in foolish guilt.</i>

15:59.001 --> 16:02.045
<i>Control yourself, listen to me.</i>

16:02.254 --> 16:04.965
<i>I have a proposal to make.</i>

16:05.174 --> 16:07.092
<i>A proposal?</i>

16:07.301 --> 16:10.345
Holy heartbreak,
how can he at a time like this?

16:10.554 --> 16:16.602
<i>I propose to perform a memorial concert
at Gotham Town Hall tonight.</i>

16:16.810 --> 16:18.103
Strange.

16:18.312 --> 16:20.397
Hardly the proposal I expected.

16:20.606 --> 16:23.817
Oh, maestro, how generous of you.

16:24.026 --> 16:28.113
Do me a great honor,
appear with me on-stage...

16:28.322 --> 16:33.368
...and sing some sweet song
in your incomparable voice.

16:33.577 --> 16:35.454
Oh, yes.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.498
I know just the thing.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.209
Wonderful, dear Harriet.

16:40.417 --> 16:44.129
Drop by my dressing room at 7
and we'll rehearse a bit.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.465
Until tonight at 7.

16:46.673 --> 16:50.719
Farewell, adieu.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.815
Alfred! Oh, Alfred.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.192
You called, madam?

17:05.400 --> 17:10.781
Alfred, will you please bring me
a tiny glass of blackberry brandy?

17:12.449 --> 17:16.912
Begging your pardon, madam, but
this unprecedented request for strong spirits...

17:17.119 --> 17:18.288
...is something amiss?

17:18.497 --> 17:21.833
It not amiss, Alfred, it's a nightmare.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.963
That man who was just here is an imposter.

17:26.171 --> 17:28.966
- He was not Chandell.
-Oh, dear me.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.509
How bizarre.

17:30.717 --> 17:35.347
- Are you certain, madam?
-Oh, yes, Alfred, I'm quite certain.

17:35.556 --> 17:39.184
When a man whom I know
as well as I know Chandell...

17:39.393 --> 17:41.853
...gives my hand a kiss...

17:42.062 --> 17:45.023
Well, Alfred, there's an old saying:

17:45.232 --> 17:47.609
"A girl can tell."

17:49.194 --> 17:56.577
<i>I know that life's the secret of it all</i>

17:56.994 --> 18:02.916
<i>All the longing, working, waiting
Burning, turn...</i>

18:03.125 --> 18:05.252
Oh, dear.

18:05.460 --> 18:08.130
Mercy me, I'm an old fool, aren't I?

18:08.338 --> 18:10.424
Oh, don't say it, dear lady.

18:10.632 --> 18:11.883
It's your hat brim.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.469
It obscures the sheet music.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.055
Perhaps if you removed your chapeau.

18:17.431 --> 18:20.142
That's a good idea.

18:25.355 --> 18:29.067
As they say in the movies,
"Stick up your mitts."

18:33.238 --> 18:35.324
Come on, out.

18:50.714 --> 18:52.924
You're not the great Chandell.

18:54.134 --> 18:59.181
You must be that awful twin brother
I read about in the papers.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.725
Your name is Harry, is it not?

19:01.933 --> 19:05.729
Your cleverness outdoes itself, sweet lady.

19:05.937 --> 19:09.691
Don't you "sweet lady" me,
you common crook.

19:09.900 --> 19:13.070
What's the plot?
Were you going to marry me for my money?

19:13.278 --> 19:16.865
I'll admit that was one notion,
but it's been revised however.

19:17.074 --> 19:22.204
The current plot is to lure you here
and hold you for a gigantic ransom.

19:22.412 --> 19:26.583
Oh, fiddlesticks,
who'd pay a gigantic ransom for me?

19:26.792 --> 19:29.711
The trustees of the
Wayne Foundation, naturally.

19:29.920 --> 19:33.882
As sole heiress
to millionaire Bruce Wayne's vast fortune...

19:34.091 --> 19:38.387
...you have to sign the papers
or they can't spend a nickel.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.223
What stupid, ugly greed.

19:41.431 --> 19:44.017
I'm delivering you to the police.

19:44.518 --> 19:46.144
Start moving.

19:46.353 --> 19:52.484
Moving, at a time like this,
when my scheme is working so perfectly?

19:53.318 --> 19:56.154
Look around you, sweet fool.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.698
Oh, sham.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.534
You think I'd fall for that old chestnut?

20:00.742 --> 20:03.286
Sleep tight, won't you?

20:12.546 --> 20:14.506
Quick, the chauffeur's outside.

20:14.715 --> 20:19.803
- Blow him a lullaby.
-Right, Harry doll.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.350
Harry to piano movers.

20:25.559 --> 20:29.521
Get over here and put the old lady
and her chauffeur in the trunk.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.738
Set up to the docks and stand back.

20:50.292 --> 20:53.420
Too bad.
She was a sweet old lady in her way.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.798
Not just sweet, Harry.

20:57.007 --> 20:59.468
One of the bravest women ever born.

20:59.676 --> 21:03.638
We've been tracking you via a secret radio
placed in Mrs. Cooper's handbag.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.308
We rescued her and the chauffeur
on the sidewalk.

21:06.725 --> 21:13.356
Now, it's lucky for us
that we brought our bulletproof Bat Shield...

21:13.565 --> 21:19.571
...but it is time to end
this criminal symphony.

21:40.634 --> 21:43.470
Poor deluded females.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.472
And you, you nasty old man...

21:46.097 --> 21:48.016
...have a whiff of Bat-gas.

22:03.198 --> 22:07.327
Gosh, Batman, maybe we don't know
how to turn this murderous machine off.

22:07.536 --> 22:10.622
It is a thought, Robin.
It's not much more than they deserve.

22:10.831 --> 22:14.167
Is there anything lower
than a lawyer who mocks the law?

22:14.376 --> 22:16.628
Or an artist who takes up crime?

22:16.837 --> 22:18.046
I'm afraid there is.

22:18.255 --> 22:22.592
A sworn crime-fighter
who tries to take justice in his own hands.

22:35.856 --> 22:38.692
With my profoundest admiration,
Mrs. Cooper...

22:38.900 --> 22:41.820
...a Citizen's Special Anti-Crime Award.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.697
Oh.

22:44.865 --> 22:49.911
Heh. A person just does what he has to do...

22:50.120 --> 22:53.748
...and that's what makes
America great, isn't it?

22:53.957 --> 22:55.792
If only there were more like her.

22:56.001 --> 22:58.920
That's enough about silly me.

22:59.129 --> 23:01.172
Where is Mr. Chandell?

23:01.381 --> 23:05.135
A note for you, madam.
The maestro asked me to deliver it to you.

23:05.302 --> 23:06.845
Oh.

23:10.891 --> 23:13.184
"Dear sweet Harriet.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.520
It's better this way.

23:15.729 --> 23:17.814
I'm not worthy of you.

23:18.940 --> 23:24.237
I must leave this morning
on a long, long tour.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.489
Good bye.

23:26.698 --> 23:29.367
Your Chandell."

23:31.286 --> 23:32.913
A long, long tour?

23:33.121 --> 23:37.167
With the usual time off
for good, uh, performance...

23:37.375 --> 23:40.170
...I expect it will last about three years.

23:40.462 --> 23:46.676
<i>Oh, if I had the wings like an angel</i>

23:48.011 --> 23:54.100
<i>Over these prison walls
I would fly</i>

23:56.019 --> 23:59.981
<i>And I'd fly to the arms</i>

24:00.148 --> 24:03.151
<i>Of my poor darlin'</i>

24:04.611 --> 24:10.700
<i>And there I'd be willing to die</i>

24:11.952 --> 24:14.871
Listen, you bulls,
I'm busting out of here, see?

24:15.080 --> 24:16.957
And ain't nobody gonna stop me.

24:26.257 --> 24:29.636
<i>NARRATOR".
Next week the Penguin waddles again.</i>
