WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.440
It didn't take.

00:06.474 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.413
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.488
PARTY PLANNER: I don't know
what to tell you.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.223
I'm not seeing a Mullen.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.892
Maybe 'cause that's not
my name. It's Mickey Molng.

00:24.925 --> 00:25.926
Mulling?

00:25.959 --> 00:28.196
Molng.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.997
I don't... could you spell that?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.032
I feel like you're trying to
get cute. Are you being cute?

00:32.066 --> 00:34.802
-Try Maldanado. M-A-L...
-We're not on the...

00:34.835 --> 00:36.370
They're not supposed
to be on the list, okay.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.139
It's Sabrina, Chip
and Ben Pemberton.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.140
We're Rita's
great-grandchildren.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.874
This is her 100th birthday.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.144
I'm sorry, I can't let you in
if you're not on the list.

00:43.177 --> 00:46.480
No, okay. Well, here's the thing
about lists: I have one also,

00:46.514 --> 00:48.516
and you, my friend,
are just climbing right up

00:48.549 --> 00:50.251
-to the tippy-top of it...
-Grandpa!

00:50.284 --> 00:52.986
Can you just... just stay
right-right there, please.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.789
Yeah. Come on.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.494
-PARTY PLANNER: I'm sorry,
ma'am. He just ran in. -Get.

01:00.528 --> 01:01.829
-Tippy.
-TIPPY: Oh, great.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.864
Nice to see you
up on your hind legs.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.033
Grandma, tell this
door jockey there's a mistake.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.401
We're not on the guest list.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.036
Probably because
you weren't invited.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.372
You're an infected limb
of this family

01:11.405 --> 01:13.207
and I've decided to sever you.

01:13.241 --> 01:16.009
Please see them out, lest they
further agitate the colonel.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.179
RITA:
Helen?

01:18.212 --> 01:19.580
Is that you?

01:19.613 --> 01:20.948
TIPPY:
Here we go.

01:20.981 --> 01:23.884
Oh-ho, it is!

01:23.917 --> 01:26.187
Oh, what a marvelous surprise.

01:26.220 --> 01:29.523
-I haven't seen you
in a crow's age. (gasps) -Oh.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.959
And you brought your sweet boy.

01:31.992 --> 01:35.496
Ah, Little Dippy.

01:35.529 --> 01:39.200
-Get off me.
-Rita, this is not Helen.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.934
This is the whore sister

01:40.968 --> 01:44.872
of that other whore
who married your grandson.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.207
Hush up, Tippy.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.277
My dearest friend, Helen,

01:49.310 --> 01:51.879
treks all the way
from Coral Gables

01:51.912 --> 01:54.081
-with her feeble-minded boy...
-Mm.

01:54.114 --> 01:58.118
...and you haven't the decency
to show them in?

01:58.152 --> 02:01.088
-For shame!
-For shame indeed, Tippy.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.892
Helen, you and Dippy
make yourselves at home.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.460
Well, thank you very much,
Rita. We will.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.162
Happy birthday.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.798
Yeah.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.366
-Thank you.
-(Alba chuckles)

02:12.400 --> 02:15.803
Okay, now, this is what
I'm talking about, right?

02:15.836 --> 02:17.738
This is the life
I signed up for

02:17.771 --> 02:19.573
when I agreed
to babysit you turds.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.675
This is the life we were living
before you showed up.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.110
ALBA:
Wow, this is nice.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.646
Can I drink water
out of the goldfish pond?

02:25.679 --> 02:27.080
No. No.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.116
Why not? The fishes do it.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.818
Let's act like we belong here.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.820
Aah! Hot! Oh, Go...

02:32.853 --> 02:34.522
-Just excessively hot.
-Yeah. Hey.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.956
-Yeah, you got to use the stick.
-Yeah.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.858
You want to use a stick
and stick it in the fruit.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.860
-And then the fruit goes in. Oh.
-Yeah, get some fruit in there.

02:39.893 --> 02:43.096
You know, it's not natural
to live to be 100.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.098
When I turn 70...
(imitates gun cocking)

02:45.132 --> 02:46.934
...boom-boom,
two shots in the head.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.135
Why wait till 70?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.603
May I take that, ma'am?

02:49.637 --> 02:51.472
JIMMY:
Hey.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.441
Don't just throw your bone
at the guy.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.942
Why not? It's his job.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.277
May I take yours as well, sir?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.645
No, I'm cool. Thanks.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.812
Jimmy, just give him the bone.

02:58.846 --> 02:59.880
Really, it's no trouble.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.782
It's no trouble
for me either, man.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.685
I'll just throw it in my pocket,
wait till I find a Dumpster.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.887
What's wrong with you?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.789
I don't think I'm better
than anyone, Sabrina.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.157
No one said you were.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.592
God, you're missing the point.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.394
Haven't you ever experienced
real power?

03:13.427 --> 03:15.996
Yeah, sure. Couple times, maybe.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.965
Aw. That's a no.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.900
Jimmy, you're missing out.

03:19.933 --> 03:24.004
To have another human being obey
your every single command...

03:24.037 --> 03:25.706
God, I miss having help.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.140
MICKEY:
Check out all this cool crap.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.176
Got a fancy candle, headphones,

03:29.209 --> 03:31.178
a spa gift certificate.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.381
Keep a lookout.
Let me know if anyone's coming.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.683
-Why?
-'Cause I'm gonna steal one.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.084
They're gift bags.
You don't need to steal them.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.786
There you are, Helen.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.021
I've been looking all over
for you.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.157
Gam-Gam, it's me, Chip,
your great-grandson, remember?

03:44.191 --> 03:46.059
Oh, my goodness.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.729
Dippy's speech
has improved so much

03:48.762 --> 03:52.300
since that dreadful mule nearly
put a hoof through his head.

03:52.333 --> 03:57.671
You were so right
not to lobotomize him.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.006
Well, I don't know. Eh.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.240
Sometimes I think I should have

04:00.274 --> 04:02.042
just zapped him
and moved on, you know.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.076
Hilarious.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.245
-Ow!
-Ooh.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.080
Food is for invited guests.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.182
You could stand to skip a meal.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.519
Looking more like a Chunk
than a Chip.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.721
Come now, Rita.
It's time for bed.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.389
It's 5:00.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.758
She's 100 years old.
She needs her rest.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.226
I don't want to.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.563
Helen, you and Dippy
should stay the weekend.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.031
We'll play squash.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.934
You can't even brush your
own teeth. Now, chop-chop.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.669
The colonel and I
have an early flight.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.438
Oh, yeah? Where you going?

04:30.471 --> 04:32.205
Nantucket, if you must know.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.442
Doctors worry if I take on
any more stress,

04:34.475 --> 04:36.209
I'll have an aneurysm.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.178
Well, no one would want that.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.213
-Thanks for coming.
-MICKEY: Mm.

04:40.247 --> 04:43.050
Now you can crawl back
to the ruins from which you came

04:43.083 --> 04:46.720
-and never, ever return.
-All right.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.989
-We get it, we won't come back.
-We have a house, calm down.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.391
(doorbell rings)

04:50.424 --> 04:53.260
-Rita!
-Oh, Helen!

04:53.293 --> 04:55.996
I thought you had
to get back to Florida.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.631
Oh, no. Didn't you hear?

04:57.665 --> 04:58.932
Nah, Florida's under water.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.735
Oh, my, that's terrible.

05:01.769 --> 05:02.970
Yeah, it is what it is.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.438
You remember the Little Dipper.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.939
RITA:
Of course.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.708
Come in. Come in.

05:07.741 --> 05:11.111
And you brought friends.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.753
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Thanks.

05:19.787 --> 05:20.988
Don't you feel bad at all?

05:21.021 --> 05:22.356
Nah, I never eat like this.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.957
Could go for another short stack
at least.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.459
No, I'm talking
about taking advantage

05:25.493 --> 05:26.960
of an old, senile woman.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.696
She's our great-grandma
for frick's sake.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.931
Well, would you rather have her
hanging out in this giant house

05:30.964 --> 05:32.900
all by herself,
collecting dust like a mummy?

05:32.933 --> 05:34.134
No. This way she gets to spend

05:34.167 --> 05:36.136
a lovely weekend
with her best friend, Helen,

05:36.169 --> 05:38.639
and her mushy-brained,
little fat boy.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.640
Oh, so Dippy's fat now?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.942
Chip, come on.

05:41.975 --> 05:45.479
Think you and I both know that
Dippy's not an attractive kid.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.880
RITA:
There you are.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.917
Oh, well,
there's the birthday girl!

05:49.950 --> 05:53.687
Helen, I have to tell you,
it is wonderful having you here.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.457
Hmm. It has been a long time,
hasn't it?

05:56.490 --> 05:58.526
Helen, when was the last time
you two saw each other?

05:58.559 --> 06:01.629
Oh, man, Dip. It's been, um...

06:01.662 --> 06:05.165
been awhile. It's, um,
tough to say. Probably...

06:05.198 --> 06:07.868
August 14, 1945.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.803
Wow. Good memory.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.639
That's right. That-that was
ex... She's exactly right.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.873
Oh, that day...

06:12.906 --> 06:14.508
-It was sensational.
-MICKEY: Mm.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.644
The Japanese
had just surrendered

06:16.677 --> 06:19.847
and we took to the streets
to celebrate.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.314
And celebrate we did.

06:21.348 --> 06:24.217
Oh, Rita.
Man, that was a good day.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.319
We thought those little bastards
would never give up, huh?

06:26.353 --> 06:28.722
-And you took a bottle of
champagne and threw it... -Mm.

06:28.756 --> 06:32.325
...through the window
of that dim sum palace.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.828
Huh.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.564
Of course, we found out later

06:36.597 --> 06:39.700
that dim sum was Chinese,
not Japanese.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.436
-Right. -But we didn't know
the difference back then

06:42.470 --> 06:43.904
and we didn't care.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.774
-(laughs)
-What the hell is this?

06:46.807 --> 06:48.709
Oh, it's your favorite, Dippy.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.879
Soft-boiled eggs, waffles
and sausage.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.080
-All blended up...
-(sniffs) Ugh.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.982
...just the way you like it.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.049
Gross. I'm not eating this.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.417
I want what she has,
the good stuff.

06:57.451 --> 07:00.721
And chew through
another one of my spoons?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.055
I think not, Dippy.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.257
-MICKEY: Yeah.
-Hey, look. I-I...

07:04.291 --> 07:07.160
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
Mama's not gonna say it again.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.963
You drink your breakfast like
a good boy. You got it, Dippy?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.098
Understand?

07:11.131 --> 07:13.166
Hey, Rita.
After I finish these cakes up,

07:13.200 --> 07:15.803
what do you say you take me on
a grand tour of this house, huh?

07:15.836 --> 07:17.738
I'd love to.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.240
-This place has everything!
-(Alba chuckles)

07:20.273 --> 07:22.075
What should we do first?
Go to the beach?

07:22.109 --> 07:24.578
Play tennis?
Ooh, go chase a rabbit?

07:24.612 --> 07:26.814
No, the only thing I'm doing
is heading back to the house

07:26.847 --> 07:28.081
to kick my feet up.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.483
I work too hard, Benny.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.918
Always have.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.920
But not today.
(chuckles)

07:32.953 --> 07:34.755
You want to watch a movie...

07:34.788 --> 07:36.757
Wha... Benito?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.191
(stammers, gasps)

07:38.225 --> 07:39.259
No.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.061
Don't you go in that maze.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.563
Benny!

07:42.596 --> 07:43.463
You...

07:43.497 --> 07:45.733
No! Benny! Wait! Benito!

07:45.766 --> 07:47.134
Benny!

07:47.167 --> 07:49.136
Benny, wait! Oh, ho, ho!

07:49.169 --> 07:50.971
Okay, you're trapped.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.673
Let's go. Game's over.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.942
Come on. I... oh.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.779
Uh...

07:58.812 --> 08:00.447
(chuckles):
Okay.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.349
I'm a little turned around.

08:02.382 --> 08:04.317
Do you know how we got in here?

08:04.351 --> 08:06.319
Yeah, we go this way. Come on.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.956
Is it this way? Uh...

08:08.989 --> 08:10.457
Okay, come on. This way.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.125
Oh, okay.
Come on, come on, come on.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.127
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.

08:14.161 --> 08:17.430
We go this way. Um, no?

08:17.464 --> 08:18.699
(knocking on door)

08:20.701 --> 08:22.936
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Is everything okay?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.938
No, it's not okay.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.174
My shirt is wrinkled.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.609
I pressed it this morning.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.943
Are you questioning me?

08:29.977 --> 08:31.278
Of course not. My apologies.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.613
I-I'll press it again later.

08:32.646 --> 08:35.382
No! You'll press it now.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.320
JIMMY:
Yo! Richard!

08:40.353 --> 08:43.323
Oh. Hey.
What are you guys doing?

08:43.356 --> 08:45.192
Nothing. I was just giving
Richard my laundry.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.294
Oh, I was about to do some. So
why don't you just give it to me

08:47.327 --> 08:48.528
and I'll throw it in
with my load.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.230
-No, thanks.
-Really? 'Cause we could

08:50.263 --> 08:52.132
save water.
I'll put your load with my load

08:52.165 --> 08:54.467
and just do one big load, as
opposed to Richard having to do

08:54.501 --> 08:56.036
a bunch of tiny, little loads.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.038
I said no.
And stop saying "loads."

08:58.071 --> 09:01.008
Loads.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.810
(grumbles)

09:04.044 --> 09:05.412
Gosh.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.180
What crawled up her ass?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.682
I couldn't tell you, sir.

09:08.716 --> 09:09.983
Enough with the "sir" stuff.
Call me Jimmy.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.985
In fact, what are you doing
for the rest of the day?

09:12.019 --> 09:13.220
You want to party or something?

09:13.253 --> 09:14.521
I have to work, sir.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.689
Okay, what about tomorrow?

09:15.723 --> 09:16.957
I also have to work, sir.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.291
Okay, when are you not working?

09:18.325 --> 09:19.226
Sunday.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.227
Sunday it is.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.062
You and me getting ripped, okay?

09:22.095 --> 09:24.898
Until then, give me your
laundry. I'll take care of it.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.266
I've already done
my own laundry, sir.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.500
Well, what about that shirt?

09:27.534 --> 09:29.903
I'm wearing it, sir.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.538
Yeah, and you've been
sweating in it all day.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.040
Pop it off. I'll do it.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.541
I'd rather not.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.078
Dude, I'm not leaving here
until I get that shirt.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.482
Yes, sir.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.386
All right. You know, just...

09:46.419 --> 09:48.321
It's all right, man.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.091
It's cool.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.092
It's a good fit.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.293
Sunday,

09:53.326 --> 09:55.195
-we're getting ripped.
-Okay.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.229
Yeah.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.665
Let's try this way!

09:57.698 --> 09:59.633
I know it's right.
It's got to be!

09:59.667 --> 10:01.902
No, Benito. No more ways.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.571
I am done with this maze
and its endless trickery.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.674
I will not be a slave to plants.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.941
What are we gonna do?

10:07.975 --> 10:08.942
Move aside.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.411
(cracking, grunting)

10:13.280 --> 10:16.116
(yells)

10:17.117 --> 10:18.618
MICKEY:
Pull!

10:19.987 --> 10:22.255
-Boom! Skeet, skeet!
-Ooh!

10:22.289 --> 10:23.556
-Bravo.
-Yeah.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.192
Now let me show you
how it's done.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.760
-Go for it.
-Pull!

10:28.428 --> 10:29.897
Oh...

10:29.930 --> 10:31.799
I said pull, damn you!

10:38.138 --> 10:39.172
Damn, Rita!

10:39.206 --> 10:41.074
You a cold-blooded assassin.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.209
-(chuckles)
-You want a bourbon?

10:42.242 --> 10:43.944
No, no. I'm not allowed.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.445
Doctor's orders.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.781
You're 100.
If I get to be 100,

10:47.815 --> 10:50.117
I'm not saying
I'm gonna shoot heroin, but...

10:50.150 --> 10:51.719
I'm definitely gonna snort it,
you know,

10:51.752 --> 10:52.820
or smoke it or something.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.355
You know what, you're right.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.091
Get me a gin rickey
and a pack of smokes!

10:58.125 --> 11:01.094
-Mm-hmm. -Ah.
You bring out the devil in me.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.296
(laughs)
Attagirl.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.133
-Damn the rules, am I right?
Pull! -(chuckles) Yeah.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.636
-Helen! Whoa!
-(grunts) Whoa! Oh, Dippy!

11:09.669 --> 11:12.405
Come on, man. You don't sneak up
on a drunk shooter.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.407
I almost blasted another hole
in your head.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.843
-Come here.
-Hmm?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.477
-What?
-This is us.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.479
Okay? The real Helen
and Little Dippy.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.782
Damn, I was a hot dish of ass.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.651
And, my goodness,
that mule got you, didn't he?

11:24.684 --> 11:26.586
Yeah, yuk it up. I'm leaving.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.588
What? No, you're not.
You're not leaving.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.490
Hey, take one
for the team, okay?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.125
We're all making sacrifices
here.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.526
I just drank a ham sandwich.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.195
What sacrifices are you making?

11:35.228 --> 11:36.830
You think I want to spend
the entire afternoon

11:36.864 --> 11:38.165
gabbing with this bird? I don't.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.900
I'm doing it for the family.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.635
You want to send us back to that
godforsaken, burned-up hellhole

11:42.669 --> 11:44.204
just 'cause you didn't like
your breakfast?

11:44.237 --> 11:47.841
What do you say we hit
the boulevard and go shopping?

11:47.875 --> 11:49.042
My treat.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.710
I say bring the car around,
Rita.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.213
-(chuckles)
-Eh, I could do some shopping.

11:53.246 --> 11:56.649
No, Dippy, the afternoon
is for your mother and me.

11:56.683 --> 11:59.920
-Mm. -I have something
even better for you.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.157
I am not wearing a helmet.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.860
Then I'm afraid
you won't be enjoying this.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.398
-(chuckles)
-Does Dippy like?

12:11.431 --> 12:14.234
Dippy likes.
Dippy likes very much.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.270
-* Somebody help me
-(shouts)

12:17.304 --> 12:20.273
* Somebody help me

12:20.307 --> 12:22.009
* Somebody, please, somebody

12:22.042 --> 12:25.078
-* Please help me
-(grunting)

12:25.112 --> 12:27.247
* I'm in love
now that I've found *

12:27.280 --> 12:31.484
* Birds and the bees
are helping me round *

12:31.518 --> 12:33.753
* Birds are singing
their song of cheer *

12:33.787 --> 12:34.888
* Love will escape me

12:34.922 --> 12:38.391
* I fear, somebody help me

12:38.425 --> 12:41.829
-* Somebody help me
-(shouts)

12:41.862 --> 12:45.933
* Somebody, please,
somebody please help me. *

12:45.966 --> 12:47.901
*

13:00.280 --> 13:02.015
RITA:
Psst.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.783
Helen.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.719
Helen.

13:06.753 --> 13:07.921
(chuckles)

13:07.955 --> 13:09.389
(gasps, shouts)
What are you doing?

13:09.422 --> 13:11.558
-Oh, Rita, what the hell?
-No, no, Helen, take me,

13:11.591 --> 13:13.226
-just like you used to.
-What?

13:13.260 --> 13:15.128
-Take me, take me, take me.
-No, no, no, no, no, no!

13:15.162 --> 13:18.498
-No! -What?
Didn't we have a nice day?

13:18.531 --> 13:20.267
Yeah, yeah. Good day. Good day.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.368
It's not about the day.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.702
Why won't you look at me?

13:22.735 --> 13:24.537
I am looking. I'm looking.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.073
Look at me, Helen.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.207
(high-pitched):
Mm-hmm.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.210
I said look at me!

13:31.244 --> 13:33.947
Yeah. I'm seeing it.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.582
I see everything.

13:35.615 --> 13:36.884
If you're worried my hips

13:36.917 --> 13:39.119
can't take the workout,
don't be.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.121
-(inhales deeply)
-(Mickey yelps)

13:41.154 --> 13:42.355
No, that's not it either.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.724
No, I'm-I'm sure
you could go all night.

13:44.757 --> 13:47.460
Oh, God. What am I saying?
Get off me.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.330
I got to go.
(grunting)

13:50.363 --> 13:51.631
Oh.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.266
I'm sorry.
Rita, it's not you.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.767
It's really not. It's, um...

13:54.801 --> 13:56.436
It's Little Dippy, isn't it?

13:56.469 --> 13:58.438
Yep! Yep, it's Dippy.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.108
That kid, always...
getting in the way.

14:01.141 --> 14:04.211
Forget him.
You deserve so much more,

14:04.244 --> 14:06.279
and I can give it to you.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.948
Bet you could. I bet you could.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.249
And-and if he weren't
in the picture,

14:09.282 --> 14:11.218
oh, man,
I would be all over that.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.386
And those. And, um...

14:13.420 --> 14:15.022
and even that thing.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.190
But... oh, curse you, Dippy!

14:17.224 --> 14:20.360
You selfish, feeble-minded boy.
(chuckles)

14:20.393 --> 14:22.362
Oh, I have to go check on him.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.831
(sighs)

14:31.638 --> 14:33.106
Oh, there you are. Listen.
Rita's a lesbian.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.008
She's madly in love with me,
so pack your bags.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.176
We will get out of here.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.377
What? No.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.845
Did you hear what I just said?

14:38.878 --> 14:40.413
Your great-grandmother
tried to bone me.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.649
I had to sleep in my car
just to get away from her.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.651
-I'm not going anywhere.
-I thought you hated it here.

14:44.684 --> 14:47.520
I did, but then I came around
on this whole Dippy situation.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.056
I got to tell you,
this is pretty sweet.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.590
I am cleaner
than I've ever been.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.859
I-I'm not wasting any time
chewing my food,

14:52.892 --> 14:54.427
and I'm pretty sure
I could dump in my pants,

14:54.461 --> 14:56.396
and someone
would have to take care of it.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.498
Oh, well, that sounds so lovely.
That's wonderful.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.501
Guess what I did? I woke up with
a 100-year-old boob in my face.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.570
-So what?
-The woman is a sexual predator.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.372
I'm supposed to have dinner
with her tonight.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.673
A dinner I can only assume

15:06.706 --> 15:08.408
comes with a whole lot
of expectations.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.477
Hey. "We all got to
make sacrifices," remember?

15:10.510 --> 15:11.844
-I don't sound like that.
-Okay.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.513
So some grand old dame
wants to get in your pants.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.949
I'm certain you've debased
yourself in worse ways.

15:15.983 --> 15:19.086
Now, if you'll excuse me, Little
Dippy's got to get his soak on.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.655
JIMMY:
Hey, Richard.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.691
It's Sunday.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.493
Time to hear your little sins.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.429
I got cold beer, crisp shirts,

15:29.462 --> 15:30.497
down to...

15:30.530 --> 15:32.865
(gasps)

15:32.899 --> 15:34.567
Well, well, well.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.736
If it isn't Little Miss
"no fraternizing with the help,"

15:36.769 --> 15:39.072
and Mr. "I've got
too much work to hang out."

15:39.106 --> 15:40.440
Jimmy, get out of here.
We're busy.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.242
What happened
to your work, Richard?

15:42.275 --> 15:45.612
-Jimmy, we-we are...
-Oh, I see.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.515
You're only on a first-name
basis with those you betray.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.384
And you. Some family.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.153
We're not family.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.355
Jimmy.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.424
(music playing faintly)

16:00.994 --> 16:03.196
(shouts)

16:04.331 --> 16:06.899
Helen and I need time alone.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.568
(Chip panting)

16:08.601 --> 16:10.303
(quietly):
Oh, my God.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.744
(door opens)

16:17.777 --> 16:20.947
-We're leaving, now.
-Oh, thank God.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.749
Crazy bitch just tried
to murder me with a toaster.

16:22.782 --> 16:26.119
-She what? -She said that
"Helen and I need time alone."

16:26.153 --> 16:28.788
-Oh, my God. -I know.
Pack your things. Let's go.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.157
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.524
We'll go. We will.

16:31.558 --> 16:32.825
-What? Well...
-(snaps fingers)

16:32.859 --> 16:34.994
I should probably
go say good-bye first, though.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.629
She just tried to kill me.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.466
I know, but she did that for me.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.469
Nobody's ever tried to
kill anybody for me before.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.071
She really does love me.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.605
She doesn't even know
who you are.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.507
-She loves Helen.
-You know what?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.742
That doesn't matter. The woman
has been very lovely to us,

16:49.776 --> 16:51.311
and we're not gonna
just ghost her.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.346
She's 100. She is a ghost.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.348
Look, I got dinner with her
in 20 minutes anyway.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.850
I'll go. I'll let her down easy,
and then we'll leave.

16:57.884 --> 16:58.918
It's 3:00.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.187
I know it's 3:00.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.788
She goes to bed at 5:00.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.156
Don't you have a turkey dinner
to go drink somewhere?

17:03.190 --> 17:04.224
Get out of here, Dippy.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.392
Fine, I'm...

17:05.425 --> 17:06.659
I'm gonna go pack my things.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.628
Hey, girl.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.197
-(inhales)
-(clears throat)

17:10.230 --> 17:11.564
Oh, Helen.

17:11.598 --> 17:15.302
You look absolutely stunning.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.737
Thank you, Rita. So do you.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.673
Oh, a little more covered
than I'd like.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.309
(chuckles): Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L-Let's cool it

17:22.342 --> 17:23.443
on the hand stuff.
(chuckles)

17:23.476 --> 17:25.178
-Ooh. Oh!
-(gasps) Oh!

17:25.212 --> 17:28.248
You know what? Moratorium
on foot stuff, too. Okay?

17:28.281 --> 17:30.683
So, listen, Rita.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.984
We need to talk.

17:32.018 --> 17:35.288
Before you say another word,

17:35.322 --> 17:37.224
I want you to have something.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.791
No. Come on.
No more gifts, okay?

17:38.825 --> 17:40.427
Please just-just let me
say this.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.595
I need to tell you...
(gasps) Oh, my!

17:42.629 --> 17:44.931
That's, uh...
Oh, crap. That's pretty.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.534
Then, let me take care of you.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.770
I'll treat you like gold, baby.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.773
Uh, no, we can't do this
anymore. Listen, Rita,

17:53.806 --> 17:56.309
I got to go back to Florida.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.777
I'm sorry, but this is over.

17:57.810 --> 18:01.748
-How many times will I let you
break my heart? -Oh...

18:01.781 --> 18:03.650
-(crying): I just...
-No, come on.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.084
Don't cry, please?

18:06.986 --> 18:08.255
Listen.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.424
You're my best friend, Rita.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.526
And I-I love you.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.528
I always will.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.631
I want you to have this,

18:18.665 --> 18:21.067
to remember me.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.236
Yeah, okay. That sounds good.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.072
I'll miss you, Helen.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.575
I'll miss you, too.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.876
RICHARD:
Please, Jimmy.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.043
-Let me explain.
-No, you know what?

18:31.077 --> 18:32.379
She doesn't even like you,
Richard. All right?

18:32.412 --> 18:33.713
She's just trying
to get off on some

18:33.746 --> 18:35.014
class dynamic power play.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.383
Yeah, he knows that.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.450
TIPPY:
Richard!

18:37.484 --> 18:39.519
Where are your clothes?

18:39.552 --> 18:41.554
-(tires screech)
-Grandma.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.456
What the hell is going on here?

18:43.490 --> 18:44.591
Okay, you know what?
W-We can explain.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.459
It was Mickey's fault.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.428
Where is she?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.929
(both moaning)

18:53.766 --> 18:55.968
What the hell?
Unhand that woman!

18:56.002 --> 18:57.404
Oh! Ooh...

18:57.437 --> 18:58.638
No. Uh...

18:58.671 --> 18:59.939
Nah, that's not,
it's not what it--

18:59.972 --> 19:01.774
it's not what it looks like.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.811
It looks like you are raping my
100-year-old mother-in-law.

19:04.844 --> 19:05.812
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.247
No. That was, uh--

19:07.280 --> 19:08.948
I was comforting her.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.450
It was a good-bye kiss.
You know?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.118
She-she gave me a necklace.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.786
I-I was doing the right thing.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.355
The woman has dementia.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.390
Mickey, what's wrong with you?

19:17.424 --> 19:18.925
-Uh...
-JIMMY: Oh, this is great.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.327
You're having sex
with this old bird.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.561
You're banging the butler.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.296
Ew, gross. I'm not banging him.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.964
-What are you doing? -You know,
just slapping him around

19:24.997 --> 19:26.433
and burning him up a little bit.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.368
-JIMMY: Ah.
-RITA: Good for you, dear.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.437
I'm a lesbian.

19:30.470 --> 19:31.971
Rita, you're smoking?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.606
I'm living my life.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.941
That's it.
I'm calling the police.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.109
-What?
-This is elder abuse.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.811
No, no. No, that's not
necessary. No, no.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.847
After the hellish weekend
I just had with the colonel,

19:40.880 --> 19:43.850
I come home
to a damn Roman orgy?

19:43.883 --> 19:45.985
Well, I see that you're upset,
but if you just ask Rita,

19:46.018 --> 19:48.988
you'll understand; she just had
the best weekend of her life.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.123
I mean, look how happy she is!

19:52.692 --> 19:55.528
(screaming, gasping)

19:55.562 --> 19:57.497
(explosion in distance)

20:00.567 --> 20:02.835
I think we're going
the wrong way.

20:02.869 --> 20:03.970
Yeah. Thank you, Benito.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.538
You've been a lot of help today.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.012
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

20:13.045 --> 20:15.147
Sabrina,
can I call you sometime?

20:15.181 --> 20:16.883
Ooh, uh...

20:16.916 --> 20:18.618
Yeah, I don't think so.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.587
You know, the job was kind of
the whole thing for me,

20:20.620 --> 20:22.989
so now that you don't
work here anymore, it's...

20:23.022 --> 20:24.624
JIMMY: Yeah, and you can't
have mine, either.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.993
'Cause you had your chance,
and you missed it.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.595
So...

20:31.464 --> 20:34.667
Well, it all happened
very fast, you know?

20:34.701 --> 20:36.669
-I bet she didn't feel a thing.
-CHIP: Yeah.

20:36.703 --> 20:39.205
Maybe she'll think twice about
trying to kill me next time.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.707
Chip, she's our
great-grandmother.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.008
And she's dead.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.876
Exactly. Chippy don't play.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.345
Ugh.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.113
Uh, what do you think
this means for us?

20:47.146 --> 20:49.048
Well, it's Tippy's house now.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.384
I doubt she's gonna be
as accommodating.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.186
Let's go pack our stuff.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.255
Uh, Mickey?

20:56.289 --> 20:58.958
Seems you have a telegram.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.794
Huh.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.771
"If you can't stop
the infection from spreading,

21:11.804 --> 21:13.506
"best to let the body die.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.007
"I've had enough
of this rotten family,

21:15.041 --> 21:17.610
and the colonel's
incessant badgering."

21:19.879 --> 21:21.881
"I hope you'll all be
very happy together.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.383
"I'm off to live my life.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.585
Tippy."

21:25.618 --> 21:26.919
What does that mean?

21:26.953 --> 21:29.288
I think it means
we get the house.

21:29.322 --> 21:30.423
And the colonel.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.091
Oh, that old broad ghosted us.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.426
ALBA:
Mickey.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.694
Mickey.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.163
Whoa. Where have you two been?

21:37.196 --> 21:38.197
Yeah, I don't want
to talk about it.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.599
I don't want to be here anymore.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.868
Can just, somebody
take me home, please?

21:41.901 --> 21:43.803
Yeah, well, the thing is...

21:43.836 --> 21:46.406
I think we are home.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.807
You guys want to go do a maze?

21:50.677 --> 21:52.144
RITA:
I'm a lesbian!

21:55.181 --> 21:57.149
Hope you
enjoyed
kickin' it
with The Mick.

21:57.183 --> 21:59.419
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:03.189 --> 22:05.825
* Hey-ay-ay *

22:05.858 --> 22:08.695
* Hey-ay-ay *

22:08.728 --> 22:10.763
WOMAN:
This is our story.

22:10.797 --> 22:13.065
* Can't stop me now *

22:13.099 --> 22:15.134
* Can't stop me now *

22:15.167 --> 22:17.169
* I'm just doing what I do *

22:17.203 --> 22:18.671
* Won't stop doing what I do *

22:18.705 --> 22:20.239
* Can't stop me now *

22:20.272 --> 22:23.242
-* Can't stop me now *
-* Can't stop me now *

22:23.275 --> 22:25.512
-* Cannot beat me *
-* Can't stop me now *

22:25.545 --> 22:27.146
* I'm just doin' what I do *

22:27.179 --> 22:29.416
* Won't stop doin' what I do *
