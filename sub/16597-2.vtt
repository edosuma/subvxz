WEBVTT

00:04.638 --> 00:07.575
There they are,
Welltopia's cutest couple.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.110
Isn't this exciting?

00:09.177 --> 00:11.579
You and me working
in the same place,

00:11.645 --> 00:14.882
just like Mulder and Scully,
solving medical mysteries.

00:14.948 --> 00:18.552
But the big mystery is,
will they or won't they?

00:18.619 --> 00:21.122
(CHUCKLES)
Spoiler alert,
they will.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.456
(SQUEALS)

00:23.457 --> 00:24.858
Unsubscribe.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.129
It is exciting.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.963
But it's also a big change
for me.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.999
Having my own practice
for 19 years,

00:32.066 --> 00:33.401
I'm used to being
my own boss.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.303
(CHUCKLES)
Not just yours.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.005
Get it?
'Cause you're mine, too.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.273
I got it.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.574
Wives be bossing.

00:40.641 --> 00:41.775
Boom.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.612
Look at this way,
every day,

00:44.678 --> 00:47.115
you'll be collaborating
with really brilliant doctors.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.416
And you.
And me.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.585
And we'll have access
to my office

00:51.652 --> 00:53.854
in case you're overcome
with the urge.

00:53.921 --> 00:55.689
To...consult?

00:55.756 --> 00:57.091
Ooh, consult,
that's good.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.326
That'll be a code word.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.827
Naughty. (LAUGHS)

00:59.893 --> 01:01.629
I was gonna go with
"humpy time."

01:01.695 --> 01:03.063
Let's stick
to "consult."

01:04.165 --> 01:05.333
Humpy consult.
No.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.767
Okay. Okay.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.271
Wow, Dad.
What's going on here?

01:10.338 --> 01:12.673
Frittata.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.875
I got to admit, I wasn't sold
on your dad living here,

01:14.942 --> 01:16.477
but he does make
a nice breakfast.

01:16.544 --> 01:17.545
Ran out of eggs.

01:17.611 --> 01:18.812
You get apple.

01:21.349 --> 01:23.717
Thanks for breakfast,
Grandpa. Let's bounce.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.753
Bye, Mom and Dad.
Have a good first day,
honey.

01:25.819 --> 01:26.887
Yeah, good luck.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.222
Oh, I won't need luck.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.258
I know I've had trouble
making friends in the past,

01:30.324 --> 01:31.725
but this is
middle school,

01:31.792 --> 01:33.994
the most socially welcoming
place of all.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.331
Yeah, absolutely.

01:44.838 --> 01:48.909
Well...the hat's
an interesting choice.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.111
Yeah, he'll fit right in
with all the other...

01:51.179 --> 01:53.914
old-timey detectives.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.384
Yeah, he can solve the case
of the missing friends.

02:03.757 --> 02:04.892
Hey, everybody.

02:04.958 --> 02:09.430
Damona, forget Yellowstone,
Glacier, and Yosemit-ay.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.100
Ben and Allison
are my two favorite Parks.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.205
Welcome to Welltopia,
you national treasure.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.307
Thank you, Clark.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.708
And until you get
your own nurse,

02:20.774 --> 02:21.875
Clark will help
with patients.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.211
Absolutely.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.579
And Damona will be happy
to handle your appointments.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.716
Damona will handle them.
"Happy" is a whole
another thing.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.984
Oh, that reminds me,

02:31.051 --> 02:33.020
(SINGSONG VOICE) Mr. Davis
still needs a psych referral.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.922
Oh. How convenient.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.791
I happen to know
a certain sexy psychiatrist

02:37.858 --> 02:39.727
who, no braggies,

02:39.793 --> 02:42.763
has zero fear of intimacy
with yours truly.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.097
I wouldn't go
that far.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.167
Here is Mr. Davis' file.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.802
Great. I'm on it.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.471
Damona, I'm available
to see him at 2:00.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.873
I'm on break.
I'm available to
call him in 15.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.510
Yeah, Mr. Davis,
I saw him
a couple weeks ago.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.912
He now complains
of fatigue and lethargy.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.381
Physical exam normal.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.683
Checked for thyroid
and anemia, also normal.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.252
So medically speaking...

03:04.318 --> 03:07.821
(NASALLY) "I'm Mr. Davis,
and I'm sad."

03:07.888 --> 03:10.724
Well, I'm shocked
your empathy didn't cure him.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.493
I'll give him
a full psych evaluation.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.528
Ehh, it's a
pretty straightforward case.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.030
Just sling some pep pills
at old Weepy Macgillicuddy

03:17.097 --> 03:18.699
and ship him off
to Happyville.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.168
And when you're done
with that,

03:21.235 --> 03:23.804
maybe you and I
can rendezvous for a consult.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.106
Humpy time?
Humpy consult?

03:26.173 --> 03:27.375
Dude!

03:27.441 --> 03:28.742
We just had
a whole conversation

03:28.809 --> 03:31.312
about keeping things
professional in the workplace.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.914
People, I have
a very personal announcement

03:33.981 --> 03:35.215
regarding
my dating life.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.417
I'm out.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.752
Oh, welcome, Allison.
This affects you, too.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.254
Pretty sure it doesn't!

03:41.622 --> 03:44.692
Anyway, I met the most amazing
woman over the weekend,

03:44.758 --> 03:45.926
Cheryl.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.428
We had brunch yesterday,

03:47.495 --> 03:49.697
and our date only just ended
moments ago.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.400
I trust you get
the inference.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.303
I think we do.
Yeah, totally.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.670
I slept with her.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.672
Oh, I did not get that
at all.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.510
Oh, Damona.

04:03.477 --> 04:07.281
Dear...dear Damona.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.550
I imagine my fresh adventure
with Cheryl

04:09.617 --> 04:12.052
can't help but affect
what we've had going
for the last three months.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.321
That's okay.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.323
I'm talking about
our frequent nights

04:15.389 --> 04:17.691
of torrid, if noncommittal,
lovemaking.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.795
Pat, I...I'm, I'm fine,
because...

04:22.696 --> 04:24.865
I met someone, too.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.199
Really?
Yeah.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.735
His name is Eric,

04:27.801 --> 04:29.470
and we've been seeing
each other for a couple
weeks now.

04:29.537 --> 04:32.440
And I didn't tell you 'cause
I didn't know how you'd feel.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.742
I feel great!

04:34.808 --> 04:37.244
Yeah, yeah. I'm great,
and you're great.

04:37.311 --> 04:40.381
And Cheryl, oh, Cheryl,
Cheryl is...

04:40.448 --> 04:41.749
She's great.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.419
The only thing that
isn't great is my
aching sacrum

04:45.486 --> 04:47.087
from all
the bouncy-bouncy.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.057
I trust
you get the inference.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.000
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

05:00.067 --> 05:03.804
Hey, Pat.
I have the authorization forms
for those CAT scans.

05:03.871 --> 05:06.474
All right. CAT scans.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.242
Ah, if only our scientists
could build a machine

05:09.309 --> 05:11.545
that could look inside a man
and see his heart.

05:12.913 --> 05:16.817
Okay, that's literally
what a CAT scan does.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.786
Anyhoo, good news
about you and Damona

05:18.852 --> 05:21.054
both finding other people.
That sure worked out.

05:21.121 --> 05:24.458
Well, it would have
if only my Cheryl was real.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.661
Yeah, that's right,
I made her up.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.730
What?

05:29.797 --> 05:31.932
You...invented a woman,

05:31.999 --> 05:34.167
and you named her Cheryl?

05:36.203 --> 05:38.138
Clark, I feel
I can confide in you

05:38.205 --> 05:40.574
because you're wholly
dependent upon me for
your livelihood.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.746
Things between me and Damona
had settled into a malaise.

05:45.813 --> 05:49.249
You know,
friends with benefits
bumping uglies.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.452
I trust
you get the inference.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.822
Not an inference
if you just say stuff.

05:54.888 --> 05:58.526
But I found myself wanting
something deeper with Damona.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.695
And did you tell her
the truth?

06:01.762 --> 06:03.597
(CHUCKLING)
The truth.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.332
What is the truth?

06:06.266 --> 06:09.403
Stuff that's true?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.605
Look, you don't roll the dice
with the truth

06:11.672 --> 06:13.173
when you like someone.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.275
That's why I cooked up
this fake-girlfriend dangle.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.077
I figured
that Damona would react

06:17.144 --> 06:19.046
by wanting to take our fling
to the next level,

06:19.112 --> 06:21.949
but instead,
she got a new boyfriend.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.383
And I'm stuck
with a fake girlfriend

06:23.451 --> 06:26.119
and real dinner plans.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.388
You actually made
dinner plans?

06:28.456 --> 06:30.624
You got to sell it,
Clark!

06:30.691 --> 06:32.693
I am committed
to this fake relationship.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.562
If only you had been
this committed

06:34.628 --> 06:36.263
to the real relationship.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.131
Huh.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.300
You are very wise.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.739
Hey, Grandpa.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.575
Hey. How was
first day of school?

06:47.641 --> 06:48.709
Make any new friends?

06:48.776 --> 06:50.711
No, none of the other kids
talked to me.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.781
But I've made some inroads
with the library staff.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.250
I joke with them,
they shush me.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.619
We go 'round and 'round.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.555
You need friends
your own age.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.624
If people don't get Dave,
it's on them.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.392
I say
let Dave do Dave.

07:05.459 --> 07:08.862
No! Dave done Dave
long enough!

07:08.929 --> 07:12.032
So...you're saying
he should change himself
just to please others?

07:12.099 --> 07:14.167
Now you're talking!

07:14.234 --> 07:15.536
It's very important
to be liked.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.437
(SCOFFS) But you always
discouraged me

07:17.505 --> 07:18.806
from trying too hard
to be popular.

07:18.872 --> 07:19.973
Of course.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.043
Boys should be popular,
girls best not popular.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.578
It's called
double standard.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.581
Your new school, huh?

07:27.648 --> 07:29.382
You have a chance
to reinvent yourself.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.018
Dave, you do not
have to...

07:31.084 --> 07:32.820
As we say
in the library, "Shh."

07:34.755 --> 07:36.957
Reinvent myself?
Tell me more.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.126
Trust me, it works.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.928
Now, I wasn't
always like this.

07:40.994 --> 07:44.131
Back in Korea,
I was gruff and serious.

07:44.197 --> 07:47.501
When I came to America,
I became funny guy!

07:53.040 --> 07:55.609
So, how's it going
with that new fella of yours?

07:55.676 --> 07:57.511
Jeremiah, was it?

07:57.578 --> 07:58.779
Eric.
Hm.

07:58.846 --> 07:59.913
How's Cheryl?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.282
Devoted. Oh, yeah,
look what she sent me.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.056
A festive fruit bouquet.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.859
Because the only thing
sweeter than pineapple

08:11.925 --> 08:15.362
is a real relationship
with a real person.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.131
Wouldn't you say?

08:20.300 --> 08:21.935
Mmm!

08:22.002 --> 08:24.004
(MUFFLED)
Room-temperature fruit.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.142
ALLISON: Hey, Ken,
you got a sec?

08:29.209 --> 08:30.377
Yeah, what up, Doc?

08:30.443 --> 08:32.279
Ah. Hey.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.014
I had some thoughts
about Mr. Davis.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.716
Oh, yeah, sad sack.

08:35.783 --> 08:38.185
Drugs, not hugs. Next.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.486
That's just it.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.855
We had a session,
and he's not depressed.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.456
His symptoms aren't
psychological.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.392
(IMITATES BUZZER)
Ooh, so sorry,

08:45.458 --> 08:48.395
but my exam did not reveal
any physical issues.

08:48.461 --> 08:51.231
Well, maybe you need to...
dig a little deeper.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.939
Dig a little...what-er?

08:59.006 --> 09:00.941
I think this guy
needs a second look.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.710
Very good. That's good.
Then give it to him.

09:02.776 --> 09:03.944
(CHUCKLES)

09:04.011 --> 09:06.880
I just gave you
my diagnosis.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.582
The ball's back
in your court.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.717
Mmm!

09:12.485 --> 09:13.621
Um...

09:13.687 --> 09:16.156
see, sweetie,
uh, I know you're new here,

09:16.223 --> 09:21.294
but, um, nobody punts
a patient back to Dr. Park.

09:21.862 --> 09:22.930
Mmm!

09:24.832 --> 09:28.836
Well, sweetie,
this Dr. Park punts.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.307
Oh, no, she did not!

09:35.275 --> 09:37.878
And by that,
I mean she totally did,

09:37.945 --> 09:39.546
(HIGH-PITCHED)
and we all saw it!

09:39.947 --> 09:41.014
Oh!

09:49.957 --> 09:51.925
So, how was school
today?

09:51.992 --> 09:53.226
Aw, thanks for asking.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.195
It's off to a good start.
I think this year...

09:55.262 --> 09:57.230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.667
What about you?
Did you reinvent yourself?

09:59.733 --> 10:02.770
I tried to be
the quiet man of mystery,

10:02.836 --> 10:05.438
staring out the window,
thinking deep thoughts.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.545
But nobody must
have been curious about
I was staring at.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.114
I know
what you're staring at,

10:14.181 --> 10:15.916
lonely future,
no friends.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.954
(CHUCKLES) You are kind of
the funny guy in America.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.693
Hey!
How's working together?
You guys still married?

10:25.759 --> 10:28.028
(CHUCKLES)

10:28.095 --> 10:31.064
It's going fine. You know,
working out a few kinks.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.433
Mom, I need you to sign
a permission slip for school.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.702
Uh, ask your dad.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.137
Oh, so you're punting that
to me, too?

10:38.005 --> 10:39.372
Oh, no.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.775
No one punts back
to Dr. Park.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.210
(CHUCKLES)

10:44.678 --> 10:46.947
Here. Oh, you want
to second-guess my work?

10:47.014 --> 10:49.883
No, 'cause I actually trust
your competence.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.219
Two L's in "Allison"?
That doesn't look right.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.957
Well, I'm gonna go get a jump
on my lonely future.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.592
I'll give making friends
another shot in adulthood.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.194
Dave, wait.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.866
Let me tell you the story
of an ancient Korean emperor.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.667
He was scared
to rule his people,

11:07.735 --> 11:09.402
afraid they
wouldn't like him,

11:09.469 --> 11:13.606
until a wise man
gave him a feather from
a magic barn owl.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.276
This feather
brings confidence,
and the young emperor

11:16.343 --> 11:19.479
became the most powerful
ruler of his time.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.349
And I'm supposed to believe
barn owls are magical?

11:22.415 --> 11:24.151
They are in Harry Potter.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.754
Uh, Hedwig's
an arctic snow owl.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.355
If you can't retain
your Rowling,

11:28.421 --> 11:30.858
at least keep up
with basic ornithology.

11:32.559 --> 11:33.994
Fine.
You don't believe me?

11:34.061 --> 11:36.930
Have fun staring out a window
all day, like bored cat.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.805
Maybe I could use
one of those feathers.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.406
Hard to find,
very rare.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.843
But...
you are in luck.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.112
I brought this
all the way from Korea,

11:52.179 --> 11:54.047
given to me
by my grandfather.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.217
Here.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.754
Thanks!
Magical and stylish
to boot!

12:06.559 --> 12:08.495
Is that feather the secret
to your confidence?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.798
No! I'm confident
because I'm awesome!

12:15.535 --> 12:18.638
And I spot that
beautiful girl across
the restaurant.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.274
I tell the waiter,
"I want to send her a drink."

12:21.341 --> 12:22.843
But he accidently
brought it to Damona.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.178
(LAUGHTER)

12:25.245 --> 12:26.914
Well, imagine
my disappointment.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.982
I thought it was
from the hot bartender.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.751
(LAUGHS)
Man, you guys are crazy!

12:31.819 --> 12:34.121
What's with all this laughter
in a professional setting

12:34.187 --> 12:36.489
where patients
come to find out
they have weeks to live?

12:37.557 --> 12:39.226
Pat, this is Eric.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.796
Well. Eric.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.298
Any boyfriend of Damona's
is a...

12:46.066 --> 12:47.467
boyfriend of mine.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.603
We should get going.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.172
Yeah, nice meeting
you all.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.706
Uh, hey,
you know what, Eric?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.308
I have
a special someone, too.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.110
Her name is Cheryl.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.748
Yeah, she's a,
she's a, a Mesan,

13:01.815 --> 13:04.217
in that she is
from Mesa, Arizona,

13:04.284 --> 13:06.519
not someone who builds
with bricks and stones.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.788
That would make her existence
seem less plausible.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.591
She sounds great.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.961
Oh, she is great, Eric.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.628
She is great, yes.
You know what?

13:15.695 --> 13:17.197
Maybe the four of us should
go out some time, for tapas.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.832
That's Cheryl's...

13:20.033 --> 13:21.969
favorite
regional Spanish cuisine.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.538
Okay. Sounds good.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.674
Yeah, yeah, good, good.
You know what?

13:27.740 --> 13:29.542
I...I'll check with Cheryl,
and we'll shoot you
some dates.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.211
Okay.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.780
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

13:33.847 --> 13:37.184
You're, you're gonna
shoot her some dates?

13:38.418 --> 13:40.687
Pat! What is
your endgame here?

13:41.955 --> 13:44.524
I don't know
what I'm doing!

13:44.591 --> 13:47.327
The wheels have come off
the fake-girlfriend dangle!

13:49.897 --> 13:52.665
It's from my girlfriend,
Cheryl! She collects spoons!

13:55.969 --> 13:57.604
Excuse me, Dr. Park.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.673
I just found out
you're referring Mr. Davis
to another psychiatrist?

14:00.740 --> 14:02.142
Mm-hmm, Dr. Mendlove,

14:02.209 --> 14:04.611
a very good man
who respects my judgment.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.146
Well, if he respects
your judgment,

14:06.213 --> 14:07.714
that tells me a lot
about his judgment.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.519
Okay, Dr. Park,
it is one thing to
mess with me,

14:12.585 --> 14:14.955
but you do not mess with
tae kwon do champion

14:15.022 --> 14:16.523
Evan Mendlove.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.561
Dr. Park, maybe we should
take this somewhere private.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.031
Really? Consult?

14:24.097 --> 14:25.798
I mean, I'm, I'm really mad
at you right now,

14:25.865 --> 14:27.234
but, you know,
I think I could get there.

14:29.436 --> 14:30.703
Yeah.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.110
In my first week,
(DOOR CLOSES)

14:40.680 --> 14:43.383
In my first week working
at the place where you work,

14:43.450 --> 14:45.352
is it too much for you
to show me a little respect?

14:45.418 --> 14:47.087
Respect?
What about you?

14:47.154 --> 14:48.788
Just yesterday,
you told me

14:48.855 --> 14:50.723
in front of my esteemed
colleagues and Pat

14:50.790 --> 14:52.792
to dig "a little deeper."

14:52.859 --> 14:54.627
Nobody's ever
said that to me before.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.229
Sure, I've been called
difficult,

14:56.296 --> 14:59.332
an easy cry,
a fussy eater,

14:59.399 --> 15:01.868
but no one's ever questioned
my judgment as a doctor.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.836
What about me?
You'll eat anything!

15:06.006 --> 15:08.608
I mean, what about you
questioning my judgment?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.610
Don't I deserve
the same respect?

15:10.677 --> 15:13.713
Look, admit it,
You're treating me differently
because I'm your husband.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.449
Would you have told any
other doctor to "dig deeper"?

15:16.516 --> 15:19.152
Well, if any other doctor
called me "sweetie"

15:19.219 --> 15:21.321
and made a game-show
buzzer at me,

15:21.388 --> 15:23.123
I would have punched them
in the throat.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.725
(IMITATES BUZZER)
That's right.
How's that taste?

15:25.792 --> 15:27.327
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

15:28.795 --> 15:30.497
Hi, Drs. Park.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.565
So, uh,
Mr. Davis is back,

15:32.632 --> 15:34.401
and he's just
a teensy bit curious

15:34.467 --> 15:36.536
if anyone has figured out
what's wrong with him.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.472
Good. Good.
I'm gonna see him right now.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.108
And I'm gonna prove
I'm right.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.076
Oh, no!
I'm gonna prove
I'm right,

15:43.143 --> 15:44.911
and then I'm gonna
shove your smug face in it.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.746
Oh, you would lo...
(IMITATES BUZZER)

15:57.824 --> 15:59.192
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

16:00.360 --> 16:01.961
Hey, Pat.
You got a minute?

16:02.029 --> 16:03.496
Yeah.
What can I do for you?

16:03.563 --> 16:05.665
Well, I just wanted to remind
you I'm taking off Friday.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.434
Eric and I are going
up to Santa Barbara.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.169
I don't see a problem.
Thanks.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.104
Hey, bring back
some restaurant recommends

16:11.171 --> 16:12.572
for me and Cheryl,
would you?

16:12.639 --> 16:14.841
She loves tapas.
I've mentioned that twice

16:14.907 --> 16:16.809
in case you're clocking
my consistency.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.847
There is no Cheryl,
is there?

16:20.913 --> 16:22.215
(CHUCKLES)

16:22.282 --> 16:23.383
What?

16:24.584 --> 16:25.985
That's crazy.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.021
Well, if there isn't,
I'd sure like to know

16:28.088 --> 16:30.623
who I just gave
my Netflix password to.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.493
(LAUGHING)

16:33.560 --> 16:35.228
All right,
there's no Cheryl.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.998
What gave me away?

16:39.066 --> 16:42.302
Well... (CHUCKLES)
all that saying
that she's real

16:42.369 --> 16:45.038
made me think
she's probably not real.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.342
Why would you do this?

16:49.409 --> 16:51.578
I was trying
to make you jealous.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.080
Wait.
I thought we were just...

16:53.146 --> 16:54.647
I know,
just friends with benefits.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.650
Yeah, and don't get me wrong,
I was loving those benefits.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.319
But...
Me too.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.755
Well...I just didn't expect
the "friends" part
to be my favorite.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.791
You know, sometimes
when we'd just sit and talk,

17:04.857 --> 17:06.193
that was, it was nice,
and I,

17:06.259 --> 17:08.795
I just found myself
wanting more of that.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.263
Well, you could have
said something.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.165
Oh, sure, and have you say,
"No way, stud.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.734
"You're good for one thing
and one thing only."

17:16.936 --> 17:18.438
Look, Pat...

17:19.439 --> 17:21.774
The friends part,
you still got that.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.676
That never went away.

17:23.743 --> 17:24.811
Really?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.280
(SCOFFS)
I like you.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.416
And not just for
the one thing.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.017
Oh, that makes sense.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.086
I'm not really very good
at that one thing.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.587
(CHUCKLES)

17:34.654 --> 17:36.289
So, uh...

17:36.356 --> 17:38.024
we could be friends
with no weirdness?

17:38.091 --> 17:40.193
Yeah, if you stop
making people up.

17:41.494 --> 17:42.962
I'll try.
(LAUGHING) Okay.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.831
Come here.
All right.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.566
(CHUCKLES)

17:46.633 --> 17:48.868
All right, and as my first act
of friendship,

17:48.935 --> 17:50.770
I'd like to hear
all about this Eric fella.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.439
Oh, okay.
Well, Eric is one of...

17:52.505 --> 17:53.840
I'm gonna have to stop you
right there.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.742
I really thought I was ready,
but I'm not.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.849
I'm very curious
as to what's wrong with me.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.718
Your exam checks out.
Your vital signs
are still fine.

18:05.785 --> 18:09.756
So it's clear to me
there's nothing wrong
with you physically.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.023
Punt!

18:12.625 --> 18:15.395
It's also clear you broke
your leg two years back.

18:15.462 --> 18:18.265
That's a physical injury,
if I'm not mistaken.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.233
(CHUCKLES)
Punt-mate.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.970
Broken legs are sad.

18:24.036 --> 18:27.207
Hopping around,
all your friends
calling you "Limpy."

18:27.907 --> 18:29.342
Nobody called me that.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.878
Oh. No friends?
No wonder why you're so blue.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.280
Punt-mate!

18:34.046 --> 18:35.215
Check!

18:36.549 --> 18:38.151
Is everything okay
with you two?

18:38.218 --> 18:39.752
(LAUGHS)
Where do I begin?

18:39.819 --> 18:41.120
Number 1...

18:41.188 --> 18:43.022
We're fine.
Let's get back to your leg.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.991
My leg healed
two years ago.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.160
I-I don't even know
why I'm still taking
those supplements.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.661
Wait, hang on.
Supplements?

18:48.728 --> 18:49.796
What kind
of supplements?

18:49.862 --> 18:51.030
My orthopedist
has me taking

18:51.097 --> 18:53.633
multivitamins and antacids
every day,

18:53.700 --> 18:56.102
which hasn't helped one bit
with my stomach pain.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.637
Stomach pain?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.439
Okay, you didn't mention
that when I examined you.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.408
I didn't want
to sound like a whiner.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.446
This changes everything.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.781
Dr. Park, could I have
a consult with you outside?

19:08.848 --> 19:10.450
Yes! (CHUCKLES)

19:10.517 --> 19:12.652
And it's an actual consult,
not sex.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.156
Okay, he's been taking
antacids, which is...

19:17.224 --> 19:18.458
Calcium carbonate.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.627
Yeah, and he's complaining
about stomach pain.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.094
I remember this
from med school,

19:22.161 --> 19:24.197
abdominal pain
plus depression-like
symptoms.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.633
Stones, groans,
abdominal moans means...

19:26.699 --> 19:28.235
Hypercalcemia!
Hypercalcemia!

19:28.301 --> 19:29.769
Oh! We did it!

19:29.836 --> 19:31.338
I've never been
so excited

19:31.404 --> 19:33.172
about excess calcium
in somebody's blood!

19:34.341 --> 19:36.476
So he's just got to
lay off the antacids.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.711
Exactly.
He'll be fine.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.513
And, uh...

19:40.580 --> 19:41.714
you and me?

19:42.682 --> 19:44.183
We're fine, too.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.552
You know
what the problem was?

19:45.618 --> 19:47.254
Yeah, we've been
married so long

19:47.320 --> 19:49.389
we forgot to treat each
other like professionals.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.558
Oh, I was gonna say
the patient withheld
information,

19:51.624 --> 19:53.159
but that was really
mature of you.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.894
(BOTH LAUGH)

19:54.961 --> 19:56.829
Well, I couldn't have been
that mature

19:56.896 --> 19:58.798
without somebody there
to notice it.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.668
Actually,
that doesn't really...

20:01.734 --> 20:03.169
You know what?
I'll allow it.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.544
Grandpa,
your magic feather worked!

20:11.611 --> 20:13.380
I made so many friends
today.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.047
Hey! Good for you.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.684
Toby even invited me
to his birthday party
Saturday.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.387
(GASPS) Do you think
I'll be asked to speak?

20:20.453 --> 20:22.889
I should probably
prepare something
just in case.

20:24.924 --> 20:29.629
You know, I Googled the Korean
legend of the magic feather.
Nothing came up.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.163
Of course not.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.999
I stole feather idea
from the movie Dumbo.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.803
Circus mouse
give Dumbo feather

20:36.869 --> 20:39.205
so he can have
confidence to fly.

20:39.272 --> 20:42.074
And in your version,
Dave is Dumbo.

20:42.141 --> 20:44.043
That tracks.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.646
But what happens
if Dave loses that feather?

20:46.713 --> 20:48.948
Doesn't matter, once
the elephant has confidence,

20:49.015 --> 20:51.518
he can fly
without feather.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.253
Pretty smart how
you built him up like that.

20:54.321 --> 20:57.156
Hey, this not
my first rodeo.

20:57.223 --> 20:59.392
Guys, help me!
I can't find my magic pen!

21:00.660 --> 21:01.728
Oh, my God!

21:01.794 --> 21:02.862
Oh, my God!

21:02.929 --> 21:04.564
Oh, my God!

21:04.631 --> 21:06.132
(CHUCKLES)

21:06.198 --> 21:08.401
Oh, here it is.
(LAUGHS)

21:08.468 --> 21:10.570
An emperor once used this,
you know.
