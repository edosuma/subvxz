WEBVTT

00:00.019 --> 00:01.484
Okay, friends, where were we? Oh, yes,

00:01.521 --> 00:04.287
Kat's social media campaign
was the tits...

00:04.292 --> 00:05.922
Unfortunately, Instagram has rules

00:06.005 --> 00:08.257
Against posting photos that
include women's nipples.

00:08.290 --> 00:10.826
That policy is sexist.
But her defiant approach

00:10.920 --> 00:12.920
Wasn't exactly "breast" practices.

00:12.937 --> 00:14.903
Sutton's first week in fashion

00:14.939 --> 00:17.606
Was all grunt and no glam...
Americano, two Splendas.

00:17.641 --> 00:18.774
Until she found a way
to sweeten the deal.

00:18.809 --> 00:20.809
What if I can get the paduano?

00:20.844 --> 00:22.778
But then she gets caught
between her rock

00:22.813 --> 00:24.846
And her happy place.
So you're seeing him.

00:24.882 --> 00:26.782
If you weren't, I'd kiss you right now.

00:26.817 --> 00:28.784
And Jane's relationship
with pinstripe guy

00:28.819 --> 00:30.519
Has had its highs, lows...

00:30.554 --> 00:32.487
Are you writing about me? No.

00:32.523 --> 00:33.822
And everything in between.
I had fun last night.

00:33.857 --> 00:35.524
Seems like maybe you had fun too.

00:35.559 --> 00:36.959
I had fun twice, actually.

00:36.994 --> 00:38.827
Time for a cold shower
with "The Bold Type."

00:45.002 --> 00:46.835
It's nice to be back in New York

00:46.870 --> 00:48.870
Helping the city conserve water.

00:48.906 --> 00:50.672
Shh, less talking.

00:52.876 --> 00:54.843
Ow. Ow. Sorry. You okay?

00:54.878 --> 00:57.746
Okay, um, maybe if we just...

00:57.781 --> 00:59.681
Ow!

00:59.717 --> 01:00.782
Uh, okay, maybe...

01:00.818 --> 01:02.651
Yeah. Maybe together?

01:02.686 --> 01:05.453
Uh, okay, maybe if we just...

01:05.489 --> 01:06.922
This is gonna be a short article.

01:06.957 --> 01:08.790
Yeah. Like this?

01:08.826 --> 01:11.460
Ow, my hip, okay.

01:11.495 --> 01:12.794
All right. It's just very hard

01:12.830 --> 01:14.696
To have good shower sex
in a tiny Brooklyn walkup.

01:14.732 --> 01:17.899
Yeah. Um, okay, um...

01:20.537 --> 01:21.770
Okay.

01:21.805 --> 01:22.871
Yeah...

01:22.906 --> 01:26.508
Yeah... Yeah...

01:26.543 --> 01:28.510
Yeah. Oh, my god.

01:28.545 --> 01:29.711
Oh, my god... yeah, if you could just...

01:29.747 --> 01:31.680
Shh! Okay.

01:31.715 --> 01:34.716
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

01:34.752 --> 01:36.885
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

01:36.920 --> 01:38.653
Oh, my god, I love you!

01:39.890 --> 01:42.591
That. I...I love that.

01:42.626 --> 01:43.992
Um, uh, if, uh...um,

01:44.028 --> 01:46.495
Okay, let's try it this...

01:46.530 --> 01:48.630
Oh...whoa!

01:55.873 --> 01:57.806
I...

01:57.841 --> 02:00.575
Can't believe...

02:00.611 --> 02:02.477
We have to go to work.

02:03.914 --> 02:05.580
I know.

02:05.616 --> 02:07.816
But I do have a meeting at "scarlet"

02:07.851 --> 02:09.651
This morning, so...

02:12.489 --> 02:15.757
Um, I should tell you

02:15.793 --> 02:18.660
That Alex knows about us.

02:18.695 --> 02:20.662
Does he? How's that?

02:20.697 --> 02:22.697
I told him.

02:22.733 --> 02:24.566
Well, he guessed.

02:24.601 --> 02:25.901
He guessed?

02:25.936 --> 02:28.603
That's not good.

02:28.639 --> 02:29.738
He's not gonna say anything.

02:29.773 --> 02:31.773
Are you sure? He's a friend.

02:31.809 --> 02:33.608
Oh, I'm sure he is,
but does he understand

02:33.644 --> 02:35.510
How big of a deal this is?

02:35.546 --> 02:36.878
He's not going to say anything.

02:36.914 --> 02:38.914
No one's gonna find out.

02:38.949 --> 02:40.882
Yeah, okay.

02:43.720 --> 02:44.853
Kat and Jane...

02:44.888 --> 02:46.655
never.

02:46.690 --> 02:48.690
They're my best friends.
They have my back.

02:48.725 --> 02:51.726
And you would know that if you
spent a little time with them.

02:51.762 --> 02:53.728
You know what? You're right.

02:53.764 --> 02:55.931
I only ever see them in the office.

02:55.966 --> 02:59.668
Maybe we have them over... For dinner.

02:59.703 --> 03:01.670
Really? If they're your best friends,

03:01.705 --> 03:03.472
I should know them.

03:10.881 --> 03:12.614
Uh...

03:12.649 --> 03:14.583
This is becoming a thing for us.

03:14.618 --> 03:16.618
Sorry, small apartment.

03:16.653 --> 03:19.688
Yeah,
to go with your incredibly small shower.

03:20.757 --> 03:23.692
Um, yeah,
so about what I said in the shower.

03:23.727 --> 03:26.795
You mean, "oh, god, yes?"
because I agree with you.

03:26.830 --> 03:28.797
We did eventually find a pretty
good angle,

03:28.832 --> 03:30.765
Which is good, 'cause I was worried

03:30.801 --> 03:33.535
I wasn't gonna have one
for my shower sex article.

03:33.570 --> 03:35.637
Angle. Funny.

03:35.672 --> 03:36.872
I meant the other thing.

03:36.907 --> 03:38.807
Jane, it's fine.

03:38.842 --> 03:41.710
I know you didn't mean it.
We both know what this is.

03:41.745 --> 03:44.613
It's all good.

03:45.782 --> 03:47.816
I gotta go. Early meeting.

03:47.851 --> 03:49.718
Yeah, 'kay. Um...

03:49.753 --> 03:52.487
I'll come back later to fix
the shower curtain.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.723
Yeah, it was your fault, so...

03:58.762 --> 04:00.462
That doesn't count.

04:00.497 --> 04:01.796
You were talking about the sex, not him.

04:01.832 --> 04:04.900
Yeah, but still he got, like...Weird.

04:04.935 --> 04:07.569
He is a sex writer.
He knows that people yell out

04:07.604 --> 04:09.471
All kinds of weird stuff
when they're doing it.

04:09.506 --> 04:11.573
I had a boyfriend who would yell out,

04:11.608 --> 04:13.542
"cubs win!"

04:13.577 --> 04:15.577
Sometimes I quote nicki minaj lyrics.

04:15.612 --> 04:17.579
Well, that's not weird.
That's just literal.

04:17.613 --> 04:19.648
"he wants to pound it like a hashtag."

04:19.683 --> 04:21.916
But it prompted the "what is this?"
conversation.

04:21.952 --> 04:23.885
Oh, I hate that conversation.

04:23.921 --> 04:25.620
So what is this?

04:25.656 --> 04:26.821
I have no idea!

04:26.857 --> 04:29.758
Oh, my god. You are so annoying.

04:31.528 --> 04:33.695
So, uh,
did you guys read his last article?

04:33.730 --> 04:35.830
Totally worth it,

04:35.866 --> 04:37.933
Or a total waste of four hours?"

04:37.968 --> 04:39.901
So that means he must be
dating other people, right?

04:39.937 --> 04:41.803
'cause there's no way
that was tiny Jane.

04:41.838 --> 04:43.905
Exactly. Well, actually...

04:43.941 --> 04:45.774
oh...

04:45.809 --> 04:47.742
What? Wow! Okay.

04:47.778 --> 04:49.611
See, that's why you're falling in love.

04:49.646 --> 04:51.680
Okay, uh-uh. So you guys are down

04:51.715 --> 04:53.548
For tonight, right? Yeah.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.584
So excited to see Richard's apartment.

04:55.619 --> 04:57.519
Totally. So not the point

04:57.554 --> 04:58.853
Of the evening. Well, and we'll, like,

04:58.889 --> 05:00.488
Talk and stuff. Whatever.

05:00.524 --> 05:02.490
Oh, we're gonna miss the boat.

05:02.526 --> 05:03.725
Come on. And I want to hear more about

05:03.760 --> 05:05.493
The, uh, four hours thing.

05:05.529 --> 05:07.829
Touching, rocking, humming.

05:10.801 --> 05:12.434
Happy anniversary.

05:12.469 --> 05:13.501
I love you. Love you.

05:13.537 --> 05:14.836
Bye. Bye.

05:17.474 --> 05:19.841
Kat, Natalie,

05:19.876 --> 05:21.776
Chlamydia. Yeah, look, I...

05:21.812 --> 05:23.745
It's not her first offense.

05:23.780 --> 05:25.714
If she's going to tweet a medical link,

05:25.749 --> 05:27.649
It needs to be medically accurate.

05:27.684 --> 05:29.451
Otherwise that leaves us open to...

05:29.486 --> 05:30.852
To legal action, yeah, I know.

05:30.887 --> 05:33.755
And I am giving her
a verbal warning to make sure

05:33.790 --> 05:36.758
That she understands
exactly where she went wrong.

05:36.793 --> 05:39.461
Well, HR needs to be aware
so they can note it in her file.

05:39.496 --> 05:42.731
But it's your department.
You set the tone. Top down.

05:42.766 --> 05:44.699
I'll get her there,
Jacqueline, don't worry.

05:44.735 --> 05:47.569
If you say so, I won't.

05:47.604 --> 05:49.504
<I>Makeup tips are one thing,</I>

05:49.539 --> 05:51.640
But when it's something like this,
multiple sources,

05:51.675 --> 05:54.643
Cdc site,
something with a dot gov or dot org...

05:54.678 --> 05:56.578
Got it, and I'm so embarrassed, Kat.

05:56.613 --> 05:58.480
I wanted to get it tweeted out
during our sexual health hour,

05:58.515 --> 06:00.448
So I rushed it.
Yeah, twitter moves fast.

06:00.484 --> 06:02.784
I get it,
but we still need to check our sources.

06:02.819 --> 06:04.519
It won't happen again.

06:04.554 --> 06:06.421
Maybe while you're getting up to speed,

06:06.456 --> 06:07.822
Let's just stick with less
heavy subject matter.

06:07.858 --> 06:10.625
Like I said, makeup tips, celeb gossip.

06:10.661 --> 06:13.695
I can totally do that.
I'm going to kick ass for you.

06:13.730 --> 06:15.797
I appreciate it.

06:15.832 --> 06:17.866
You know,
you're my first direct report, so...

06:17.901 --> 06:19.567
Make me proud.

06:19.603 --> 06:21.569
I will. All right.

06:28.845 --> 06:31.880
Sutton, one more thing. Call louboutin.

06:31.915 --> 06:34.816
I've been dreaming
about these block heels.

06:34.851 --> 06:37.452
I want them for the day-to-night shoot.

06:37.487 --> 06:38.887
Right, okay,
and who would I call over there?

06:38.922 --> 06:41.790
Your contact. And who would that be?

06:41.825 --> 06:44.459
and I was so excited

06:44.494 --> 06:45.760
About your paduano contact.

06:47.064 --> 06:50.765
I certainly didn't think that
we would have to have this talk.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.801
Um...What talk?

06:52.836 --> 06:54.669
This talk.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.805
You have a glorious job, Sutton,

06:56.840 --> 06:59.507
So glorious that it extends well beyond

06:59.543 --> 07:01.476
The offices of "scarlet" magazine

07:01.511 --> 07:04.446
And your workday well beyond
the hours that you put in here.

07:04.481 --> 07:06.648
It's breakfast with your
contact at marc jacobs,

07:06.683 --> 07:08.817
Drinks with your contact
at bottega veneta,

07:08.852 --> 07:10.485
Dinner with your contact at valentino.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.686
See the pattern?

07:11.722 --> 07:13.621
How's that sound? Expensive.

07:14.691 --> 07:16.658
You need to get out there and network.

07:16.693 --> 07:19.694
You need to make friends
at all the fashion houses.

07:19.730 --> 07:23.765
Then and only then
will you be useful to me.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.633
Networking. Right.

07:28.805 --> 07:31.573
Jane, you're single, right?

07:31.608 --> 07:33.641
Single? Um, well, it's kind of...

07:33.677 --> 07:36.678
It's a yes or no question,
not a diary entry.

07:36.713 --> 07:39.814
I need a writer to review
the new dating app setyouup.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.816
It's a blind date concept with a

07:41.852 --> 07:44.619
"who knows you better
than your best friend?" twist.

07:44.654 --> 07:46.755
You don't choose your date.
Your best friend does.

07:46.790 --> 07:48.490
You have a few best friends, right?

07:48.525 --> 07:50.625
Yes. So...

07:50.660 --> 07:51.893
W...

07:51.928 --> 07:53.862
Alex, how about you?

07:53.897 --> 07:55.663
Single, ready to mingle.

07:55.699 --> 07:56.931
Oh, that was so refreshingly easy.

07:56.967 --> 07:58.833
The story's yours. No, I can do it!

08:00.837 --> 08:02.670
I'm not exclusive,

08:02.706 --> 08:04.873
And I could date more
than one person at a time,

08:04.908 --> 08:06.608
So, yeah, I'll do it.

08:06.643 --> 08:08.410
Great. Please try to

08:08.445 --> 08:09.878
Make the article
shorter than this exchange.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

08:25.796 --> 08:27.729
So I found a digital message board

08:27.764 --> 08:29.631
For fashion assistants.

08:29.666 --> 08:30.832
I think it's gonna be
my networking lifeline.

08:30.867 --> 08:32.433
That's cool. Yeah.

08:32.469 --> 08:33.802
And they have these events.

08:33.837 --> 08:35.837
Tonight is high tea. How fun is that?

08:35.871 --> 08:38.640
I could go before Richard's. I love tea.

08:38.674 --> 08:40.607
I love this guy's abs. Ooh, let me see.

08:40.644 --> 08:42.510
Hang on, hang on. What are you,

08:42.546 --> 08:44.813
The boss of everybody now
that you have one employee?

08:44.848 --> 08:47.649
Natalie's Kat-in-training. Katalie.

08:47.684 --> 08:48.883
Yeah, let's get it trending.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.555
Hey, Jane,
where are you on genital piercings...

08:53.590 --> 08:55.590
Love them or got to have them?
If you choose someone

08:55.625 --> 08:57.592
With genital piercings, I'll kill you.

08:57.627 --> 08:59.694
Come on. Why are we picking anyone?

08:59.729 --> 09:02.430
I thought that you were, um,
in love with pinstripe.

09:02.466 --> 09:03.765
Okay, not funny.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.733
And just because I'm hooking up
with pinstripe guy

09:05.769 --> 09:07.602
Doesn't mean that I can't
hook up with other people.

09:07.637 --> 09:09.504
I am taking advantage of the fact

09:09.539 --> 09:10.872
That I'm technically single.

09:10.907 --> 09:13.475
Hey. I don't know what's more fun,

09:13.510 --> 09:14.709
Getting to pick Jane's guy

09:14.744 --> 09:15.844
Or watching Jane not get
to pick her guy.

09:15.879 --> 09:17.545
'cause you just love anything

09:17.581 --> 09:18.780
That doesn't involve your love life.

09:18.815 --> 09:21.449
Don't go there, okay?

09:21.485 --> 09:22.550
Moving on.

09:22.586 --> 09:23.885
Oh...

09:23.920 --> 09:25.854
Hello, face tattoo.

09:25.889 --> 09:28.723
Come home with me. Damn!

09:28.758 --> 09:30.825
Wait, wait, go back.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.727
What do you think?

09:32.762 --> 09:33.795
Oh, come on.

09:33.830 --> 09:35.730
Huh. Yeah, right?

09:35.765 --> 09:37.699
I think we have a match.

09:45.324 --> 09:46.591
Oh, my god, this is magical.

09:46.626 --> 09:49.127
Fashion people really know how to do it.

09:49.161 --> 09:50.428
You're just getting there?

09:50.463 --> 09:52.263
Aren't you cutting it a little close?

09:52.299 --> 09:53.430
No, I'm gonna make

09:53.466 --> 09:55.366
A targeted strike on louboutin,

09:55.401 --> 09:56.533
And then I'll be there
before Kat and Jane.

09:56.570 --> 09:58.203
'kay.

10:00.372 --> 10:01.472
Hi.

10:09.482 --> 10:11.549
Oh, petit fours. I love those.

10:11.584 --> 10:13.618
Who doesn't?

10:13.653 --> 10:16.254
I'm Sutton. I'm with "scarlet."

10:16.289 --> 10:19.189
Noelle, la perla. La perla?

10:19.226 --> 10:21.158
I'm wearing your underwear.

10:21.194 --> 10:23.261
I'm not wearing your underwear.

10:23.295 --> 10:24.361
I'm wearing la perla.

10:24.397 --> 10:26.430
I get it. Yeah.

10:28.368 --> 10:30.334
First time? Yeah.

10:30.370 --> 10:31.636
I just started out in fashion,

10:31.670 --> 10:34.205
So it's a little intimidating...

10:34.241 --> 10:36.307
Tiffany, hi!

10:36.342 --> 10:38.309
How are you?

11:05.572 --> 11:06.603
Jane?

11:06.639 --> 11:09.540
Landon? How you doing?

11:09.575 --> 11:11.376
Uh, yeah, have a seat.

11:13.647 --> 11:17.348
So I know this is a really
terrible way to start a date,

11:17.384 --> 11:20.217
But, uh, I actually have to be
somewhere after this.

11:20.253 --> 11:22.320
I know, I know, you have a hard out.

11:22.355 --> 11:23.620
Yeah, your friends already told me.

11:23.657 --> 11:26.357
it's vodka soda, right?

11:26.392 --> 11:28.626
My friends are good.

11:28.661 --> 11:30.628
Vodka soda for the lady.

11:42.341 --> 11:44.175
Yeah, I'll have another drink.

11:44.209 --> 11:45.510
Can we get another round?

11:47.313 --> 11:48.513
According to your friends,
you're a writer

11:48.548 --> 11:50.514
Who likes to write about
anything but yourself.

11:50.550 --> 11:53.184
and yet, somehow that's all I do.

11:54.321 --> 11:56.254
According to your friends,

11:56.289 --> 11:58.456
You're the adam clayton
of intellectual property law.

11:58.491 --> 11:59.623
Wow, they're nerds.

11:59.658 --> 12:01.458
Um, adam clayton, he's the bassist...

12:01.494 --> 12:03.293
The bassist for u2. For u2. Right.

12:03.330 --> 12:05.228
Yeah,
so I play bass guitar on the weekends.

12:05.264 --> 12:06.397
Oh, okay, got it.

12:06.433 --> 12:08.399
Yeah, I'm in an aught cover band.

12:08.435 --> 12:11.336
Alt covers? Not really my thing.

12:11.370 --> 12:14.171
Not alt covers. It's aught covers.

12:14.206 --> 12:17.341
We only play songs from 2000 to 2009.

12:17.377 --> 12:20.511
The aughts. Yes, the aughts.

12:20.546 --> 12:22.447
Well, those were very good years for me.

12:22.482 --> 12:24.215
Oh, really? Yeah.

12:24.250 --> 12:26.250
I'll play you something sometime.

12:26.285 --> 12:27.552
Thank you.

12:39.498 --> 12:42.399
How many of those have you eaten?

12:42.435 --> 12:43.601
A lot.

12:43.636 --> 12:46.603
Maybe you should lay off.

12:46.639 --> 12:48.505
This is high tea.

12:48.541 --> 12:50.341
Yeah, I know.

12:50.377 --> 12:52.176
It's so fun.

12:52.212 --> 12:53.578
I haven't been to high tea
since my grandma took me

12:53.612 --> 12:55.279
For my 12th birthday.

12:55.314 --> 12:57.415
No, no.

12:57.449 --> 13:00.517
It's high tea.

13:00.552 --> 13:02.352
Oh...

13:03.622 --> 13:06.357
S-so the...the petit fours...

13:07.593 --> 13:09.560
Are potent.

13:09.596 --> 13:12.362
Oh! Oh, no.

13:12.399 --> 13:14.465
Yeah.

13:14.501 --> 13:16.434
Come on, Sutton.

13:16.468 --> 13:18.503
I'll introduce you around. oh, no!

13:20.473 --> 13:22.439
uh-oh.

13:22.475 --> 13:24.175
Oh, that must be my friends.

13:24.209 --> 13:25.543
Oh, your hard out.

13:25.578 --> 13:28.312
I actually have
an exit strategy of my own.

13:28.348 --> 13:30.447
Oh, really? Yeah, my friend,

13:30.483 --> 13:32.450
He's gonna call with
a minor medical emergency

13:32.485 --> 13:34.485
In about 20 minutes just in case.

13:34.521 --> 13:36.187
Right.

13:37.557 --> 13:39.624
I'll tell you what. Um...

13:39.658 --> 13:42.393
I'll tell him to call an ambulance

13:42.428 --> 13:44.295
If you tell your friend

13:44.330 --> 13:45.562
You're gonna be a few minutes late.

14:05.485 --> 14:08.351
And my friends are getting antsy.

14:08.388 --> 14:11.556
Yeah. You want another vodka soda?

14:11.591 --> 14:13.524
Actually, I should...

14:15.328 --> 14:17.360
You know what?

14:17.397 --> 14:19.197
Yeah, let's get another. Why not?

14:19.232 --> 14:20.364
Could we get another round?

14:24.370 --> 14:26.370
It's...it's really an amazing group,

14:26.406 --> 14:28.239
A lot of people worth knowing,

14:28.274 --> 14:31.509
And everyone else
is fun to gossip about.

14:31.543 --> 14:34.378
Hi. Hi!

14:34.414 --> 14:37.215
That's Katie from calvin klein.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.483
She's totally talentless,

14:38.518 --> 14:41.185
But she's sleeping
with one of their execs,

14:41.221 --> 14:42.620
So she's kind of a big deal...

14:42.655 --> 14:44.522
Until it implodes

14:44.591 --> 14:47.291
And she's back working at off 5th.

14:49.428 --> 14:52.163
Are you okay?

14:52.197 --> 14:53.498
Yeah. Yeah.

14:53.533 --> 14:56.501
Oh, my god, you're gonna be so high.

14:56.536 --> 14:59.437
Tiffany, you have to meet Sutton.

14:59.472 --> 15:01.272
Hi! She works for "scarlet."

15:01.307 --> 15:03.474
That's such a good handshake. I love it.

15:07.347 --> 15:10.348
You...Have an awesome apartment.

15:10.383 --> 15:12.316
Thank you. Yeah, I really like it,

15:12.351 --> 15:14.418
Especially when I get
to do something like this.

15:14.454 --> 15:16.187
I'm here! I'm here.

15:16.222 --> 15:17.488
Hey. Hi!

15:17.524 --> 15:19.423
Hi. Are...are you drunk?

15:19.459 --> 15:21.392
Yeah, I'm drunk.

15:21.427 --> 15:23.293
I had an assignment
that involved cocktails,

15:23.329 --> 15:24.395
And I'm tiny, so...

15:24.430 --> 15:25.463
All right.

15:25.498 --> 15:28.199
This place...

15:28.234 --> 15:29.600
Wow! Thank you.

15:29.636 --> 15:31.269
Do you have a glass of water?

15:31.303 --> 15:33.404
Coming right up. Okay.

15:35.508 --> 15:37.608
So, uh, how was the dude?

15:37.644 --> 15:39.443
Oh, he was charming

15:39.479 --> 15:43.247
And normal and emotionally mature.

15:43.283 --> 15:45.516
Oh, wow. And then pinstripe guy texted.

15:45.552 --> 15:47.351
Oh, yeah, pinstripe guy.

15:47.387 --> 15:48.619
Sutton said you were dating
one of their writers.

15:48.655 --> 15:50.488
We're not dating.

15:50.523 --> 15:52.623
It's...Ill-defined.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.261
Oh, hello there.

15:57.297 --> 15:58.495
Hi!

15:58.531 --> 16:00.264
You guys, networking is so hard,

16:00.300 --> 16:02.233
'cause I'm really high right now.

16:02.268 --> 16:04.168
High? The petit fours

16:04.203 --> 16:06.370
<I>Were pot fours. It was high tea!</I>

16:06.406 --> 16:09.240
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

16:09.274 --> 16:10.541
It's okay. But I brought dessert.

16:10.577 --> 16:12.276
Thank you. it's pot.

16:14.147 --> 16:18.316
Ooh, that's soft hair.
It's, like, really soft hair.

16:18.351 --> 16:20.351
maybe we should get you

16:20.386 --> 16:21.552
Something to eat. I think I need to be

16:21.588 --> 16:24.120
Horizontal on a cold, flat surface.

16:24.157 --> 16:25.623
Do you want me to get you a cold...

16:25.658 --> 16:28.526
No, no, no. No. Just, um, mingle.

16:28.561 --> 16:30.261
I just need a minute.

16:33.299 --> 16:34.532
I'm gonna go check on her.

16:34.567 --> 16:37.268
Jane? I need Jane.

16:37.302 --> 16:38.569
Mm, that's me.

16:44.510 --> 16:46.444
And I thought I was the wild one.

16:48.648 --> 16:50.380
Wow!

16:50.416 --> 16:51.616
Jane, I need you.

16:51.651 --> 16:53.451
I'm here.

16:53.485 --> 16:56.287
Oh...Here comes another wave.

16:56.322 --> 16:58.289
It starts in my toes,
and then it goes...

17:01.127 --> 17:02.526
How long does this go on for?

17:02.562 --> 17:04.261
Pffft. I don't know.

17:04.297 --> 17:06.430
Not more than, like, hours.

17:06.465 --> 17:08.232
Stay with me.

17:08.267 --> 17:09.500
I'm getting in.

17:15.207 --> 17:17.108
This is nice.

17:17.143 --> 17:18.476
I feel like we should
do shots or something,

17:18.511 --> 17:21.145
Catch up. Yeah.

17:23.249 --> 17:24.548
Oh, no. What?

17:24.584 --> 17:26.215
It's my staffer.

17:26.252 --> 17:28.351
She just saw Kylie Jenner out, and...

17:28.387 --> 17:30.221
Oh, my god,
does she think this is funny?

17:30.255 --> 17:32.123
#secondhottestJenner?

17:32.158 --> 17:33.190
That's not the way our brand should be

17:33.226 --> 17:34.425
Talking about anybody,

17:34.460 --> 17:36.293
Let alone... yeah, I know. I...

17:36.329 --> 17:37.495
You need to call
your staffer immediately.

17:37.530 --> 17:41.132
No, it's okay. I just deleted it, so...

17:41.167 --> 17:42.466
Kat,
if Kylie's people get ahold of this,

17:42.502 --> 17:44.301
They're gonna want
to know it was handled.

17:44.337 --> 17:46.137
Okay, well, I just handled it.

17:46.172 --> 17:47.338
Kat!</I>

17:47.373 --> 17:51.442
And now I have to go handle that.

17:51.476 --> 17:53.144
Excuse me.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.249
Hey.

18:03.356 --> 18:04.488
You guys feeling...

18:04.524 --> 18:06.157
So good. Yeah?

18:06.192 --> 18:07.425
Amazing. Yeah?

18:07.460 --> 18:10.494
Oh, no, not good.

18:10.530 --> 18:12.229
Pfff...

18:12.264 --> 18:14.165
Okay, good again.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.567
Hey, Jane's going on
another date with setyouup guy.

18:16.601 --> 18:20.404
He kissed me. W...who knows ya, huh?

18:22.308 --> 18:23.374
Oop.

18:25.478 --> 18:27.311
Should you tell pinstripe guy?

18:27.346 --> 18:30.181
I don't know. Do...should I?

18:30.216 --> 18:31.415
You did tell him you loved him.

18:31.451 --> 18:33.216
No, shh. Oh, here I go again,

18:33.252 --> 18:35.119
You guys. I'm still going up.

18:35.154 --> 18:37.421
Come on in, Kat.

18:37.456 --> 18:40.324
Okay, I'm getting in,
but just for a few minutes.

18:40.359 --> 18:44.195
Thank you. Watch out, here I come.

18:46.299 --> 18:47.630
Whose foot is that?

18:49.601 --> 18:51.469
Everything okay in here?

18:51.504 --> 18:55.372
Richard, hi, come in. There's room.

18:55.408 --> 18:58.341
Thanks for the invite,
but I'm gonna pass.

18:58.377 --> 19:00.277
He can be really serious sometimes.

19:02.514 --> 19:05.549
did I whisper that?
I meant to whisper that.

19:05.585 --> 19:08.519
I didn't whisper that? No.

19:08.553 --> 19:11.088
You know what's a funny word?

19:12.524 --> 19:14.325
whisper.

19:43.922 --> 19:44.888
Hi.

19:46.926 --> 19:49.793
Hey. How you feeling?

19:49.828 --> 19:52.797
Well, I can feel my toes again,

19:52.831 --> 19:55.899
So I'm thinking that's a good thing.

19:58.004 --> 19:59.937
Are you super pissed?

19:59.973 --> 20:01.772
Well, believe it or not,
there was a time

20:01.808 --> 20:03.741
When I would have loved to have

20:03.776 --> 20:05.877
Three 20-something girls in my bathtub,

20:05.911 --> 20:07.911
But now...

20:07.946 --> 20:09.714
I know.

20:10.917 --> 20:14.819
I'm sorry... That I got so high.

20:14.853 --> 20:17.054
I didn't know there was weed
in those things.

20:17.089 --> 20:18.922
Well, hey, I get it.

20:18.957 --> 20:22.060
Every networking event
should end that way.

20:23.163 --> 20:24.928
Your friends are...

20:24.964 --> 20:28.665
Good people. Mm, yeah, they're great.

20:28.701 --> 20:30.067
They're fun. They're, um...

20:31.804 --> 20:32.870
Young.

20:35.808 --> 20:37.140
Yeah.

20:39.779 --> 20:42.980
Listen, this is corporate.
I got to jump on this call.

20:45.051 --> 20:47.150
Hey, guys, it's Richard.

20:47.187 --> 20:48.852
Yeah.

20:55.995 --> 20:59.096
Natalie, follow me.
I'm about to run into a meeting,

20:59.131 --> 21:02.734
But we need to have a quick talk
about Kylie Jenner.

21:02.768 --> 21:04.768
It...it was supposed to be funny.

21:04.803 --> 21:07.071
I mean, obviously, she's so hot,
but her sister's a supermodel,

21:07.107 --> 21:08.806
So that makes her the second hottest.

21:08.841 --> 21:11.074
Hey, see, that's not very funny.

21:11.110 --> 21:12.843
Okay.

21:12.879 --> 21:15.980
My bad.
You said to stick to celeb gossip.

21:16.014 --> 21:18.982
Yeah, that's not gossip.
Okay, I...I'm confused.

21:19.018 --> 21:21.718
You told me to do celeb gossip,
so I did.

21:21.754 --> 21:22.853
I feel like I'm not understanding

21:22.888 --> 21:24.020
How to do this right.

21:24.056 --> 21:26.690
Okay, uh...

21:26.725 --> 21:29.659
I can see that you're frustrated,

21:29.696 --> 21:32.029
So, uh, why don't we do
a bunch of tweets together?

21:32.064 --> 21:33.764
Yeah. I'll push my meeting

21:33.799 --> 21:35.031
And take you through it step by step.

21:37.035 --> 21:39.035
Thank you.

21:44.710 --> 21:45.976
Last night was fun though.

21:46.011 --> 21:47.812
We should do that again,
maybe at our place?

21:47.846 --> 21:49.679
Actually, no, Kat's is nicer.

21:49.716 --> 21:51.948
Uh,
were you at the same dinner party I was?

21:51.984 --> 21:55.719
Stocked bar, great food, huge bathtub.

21:55.754 --> 21:57.821
Which we also ate dinner in.

21:57.857 --> 21:59.122
Was Richard okay with that?

22:04.931 --> 22:06.663
We can't talk about him at work.

22:06.698 --> 22:08.799
I know, I'm sorry, but was he mad?

22:08.835 --> 22:11.802
No, he had fun.

22:11.837 --> 22:14.071
Uh, I should get back to work though.

22:25.083 --> 22:27.717
Hi. Hi.

22:27.754 --> 22:29.821
Um, to what do I owe this pleasure?

22:29.855 --> 22:32.989
Oh, well, I, uh,
finished my shower sex article,

22:33.025 --> 22:38.029
And I wanted to thank you, so,
um, chinese chicken or greek?

22:38.063 --> 22:39.964
Chinese chicken, please. Mm-hmm.

22:39.998 --> 22:42.766
So what are you working on?

22:42.801 --> 22:44.935
Um...

22:44.971 --> 22:46.971
Well, I should probably just tell you.

22:47.005 --> 22:49.139
Um, I had a date last night.

22:49.174 --> 22:53.977
It was for this article,
but we...Kissed.

22:54.013 --> 22:56.781
I just thought you should know.

22:58.183 --> 23:01.118
Well, everything's copy, right?

23:01.154 --> 23:03.888
Did you just quote nora ephron to me?

23:04.957 --> 23:06.790
Yes, I did.

23:06.826 --> 23:08.658
Anyways, this guy asked me out again,

23:08.694 --> 23:10.060
And I wasn't sure what to say,

23:10.096 --> 23:12.629
So I thought we should
be honest with each other.

23:12.665 --> 23:13.931
I'm confused. I thought we were

23:13.966 --> 23:15.799
Being honest with each other. Um...

23:15.835 --> 23:17.667
I just...

23:17.703 --> 23:20.071
Wanted you to know
that I'm seeing other people.

23:20.105 --> 23:22.038
Great. Well, so am I.

23:23.877 --> 23:25.643
That's what I figured.

23:26.879 --> 23:30.013
So, great... glad we cleared that up.

23:30.049 --> 23:32.817
Yeah. Thanks for your honesty

23:32.851 --> 23:35.018
And...For this salad.

23:36.255 --> 23:39.924
Okay, so I have dinner and
a room booked at the St. Regis,

23:39.958 --> 23:42.692
And a town car will pick up
you and your husband at 7:00.

23:42.728 --> 23:45.129
That is exactly what I wanted to hear.

23:45.163 --> 23:47.031
St. Regis, romantic.

23:47.065 --> 23:50.935
Uh,
I heard about last night's errant tweet.

23:50.969 --> 23:52.937
Yeah, look, I deleted it right away.

23:52.971 --> 23:54.871
Oh, no, I know, but I need to know

23:54.908 --> 23:56.973
That I can rely on you
to handle Natalie.

23:57.009 --> 23:58.775
Mm-hmm, already talked to her.

23:58.810 --> 24:00.844
Otherwise your issue becomes my problem.

24:00.879 --> 24:02.746
As it is,
that little tweet was already noticed

24:02.781 --> 24:03.880
Outside of your department.

24:03.917 --> 24:05.882
I got a call from a board member.

24:05.918 --> 24:07.752
Really? Yes, Richard hunter

24:07.786 --> 24:09.920
Saw the tweet. I guess the board members

24:09.955 --> 24:11.755
Really do pay attention.

24:11.790 --> 24:13.623
I guess they do. Mm-hmm.

24:13.659 --> 24:15.659
Which is no small deal,
certainly not to me.

24:15.694 --> 24:17.027
Yeah.

24:17.062 --> 24:19.696
Do we understand each other? Absolutely.

24:29.808 --> 24:31.908
I need to talk to you.

24:33.812 --> 24:35.745
Kat, you should not be up here.

24:35.781 --> 24:37.013
I just spoke with Jacqueline.

24:37.049 --> 24:39.015
I cannot believe that
you went over my head.

24:44.957 --> 24:47.123
I am over your head, Kat.

24:47.159 --> 24:48.960
I told you that I had it handled.

24:48.995 --> 24:50.895
I looked up Natalie's file.

24:50.929 --> 24:52.897
She is making the same mistakes
over and over again,

24:52.931 --> 24:54.130
And it is becoming a liability,

24:54.167 --> 24:56.701
So, no,
you really don't have it handled.

24:56.735 --> 24:58.034
You would never have known
about that tweet

24:58.071 --> 24:59.937
If I hadn't been
in your apartment last night,

24:59.973 --> 25:01.906
And I would never have been
in your apartment if...

25:01.940 --> 25:03.674
Kat, please.

25:03.710 --> 25:06.843
You really cannot be here.

25:06.879 --> 25:09.614
Now turn around
and get out of my office.

25:25.347 --> 25:27.480
Okay, he's coming over at 8:00.

25:27.516 --> 25:28.748
I can do this, right?

25:28.784 --> 25:30.717
I mean, if pinstripe guy can juggle?

25:30.752 --> 25:33.753
Yes, you are a modern millennial woman.

25:33.789 --> 25:35.755
Yes, I am.

25:35.791 --> 25:37.791
But two guys?

25:37.826 --> 25:41.728
I mean, when I get froyo,
I get one topping, one flavor.

25:41.763 --> 25:43.563
I definitely don't do side by side,

25:43.632 --> 25:45.365
And I definitely don't do the swirl

25:45.400 --> 25:46.733
'cause then the flavors,
they get all mixed...

25:46.768 --> 25:48.568
Okay, I feel like the analogy
could stop there.

25:48.603 --> 25:50.570
The point is I don't do messy,

25:50.605 --> 25:52.472
And that's what this is.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.574
Uh, so I did a thing. Well, hang on.

25:54.609 --> 25:57.344
We're talking about whether
or not I can juggle two guys.

25:57.379 --> 25:58.745
Tell her about the froyo. Okay, so...

25:58.780 --> 26:01.448
I went into Richard's office.

26:01.483 --> 26:03.416
What?

26:03.452 --> 26:05.318
Uh, because... He went to Jacqueline

26:05.354 --> 26:06.753
About this thing that I was handling.

26:06.788 --> 26:09.389
I had it under control...
you can't go into his office!

26:09.424 --> 26:10.557
I know. I don't even

26:10.592 --> 26:12.292
Go into his office! I know.

26:12.327 --> 26:13.560
What did he go to Jacqueline about?

26:13.595 --> 26:15.495
This stupid Kylie Jenner tweet.

26:15.530 --> 26:18.331
You are jeopardizing
my relationship and my career

26:18.367 --> 26:19.599
Over a Kylie Jenner tweet?

26:19.634 --> 26:22.569
I'm sorry. I got...I got really mad,

26:22.604 --> 26:24.504
And Natalie tweeted out
this thing last night...

26:24.539 --> 26:26.539
So yell at Natalie!

26:26.575 --> 26:28.508
I have to call him.

26:31.446 --> 26:33.713
I messed up, didn't I? Yeah.

26:33.749 --> 26:37.617
Oh, my god, Natalie is just...
she's just not getting it.

26:37.652 --> 26:40.720
I keep trying to explain things to her,
and...

26:40.756 --> 26:43.356
She's just not.

26:54.436 --> 26:56.403
Hey. Hey, sorry

26:56.438 --> 26:57.604
I'm just calling you back.

26:57.639 --> 26:59.606
Haven't had a second. This day.

26:59.641 --> 27:01.708
No, I know. It's...

27:01.743 --> 27:03.610
Richard, I'm so sorry.

27:03.645 --> 27:06.413
I cannot believe she did that.
Is everything okay?

27:06.448 --> 27:08.381
Yeah, it's okay now.

27:08.417 --> 27:11.284
But it was...it was bad.

27:11.319 --> 27:12.419
I know.

27:12.454 --> 27:15.288
I...I...I know.

27:15.323 --> 27:18.324
Kat's intense,
and she knows she messed up.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.527
She would never do anything
intentionally to hurt me.

27:20.562 --> 27:22.295
Hurt you?

27:22.364 --> 27:23.596
Sutton, I know you're worried about

27:23.632 --> 27:25.498
How this would all look for you...

27:27.502 --> 27:28.701
Okay. Thank you, rachel.

27:28.737 --> 27:30.670
I'll be right there.

27:32.474 --> 27:33.640
I know you're worried
how this will look for you,

27:33.675 --> 27:35.542
And, yeah, it won't look good,

27:35.577 --> 27:38.311
But I need you to realize
how bad it would be for me.

27:38.346 --> 27:39.746
Do you have any idea what I'd look like,

27:39.781 --> 27:41.781
What this would do to my career?

27:41.817 --> 27:44.717
If this gets out... this can't get out.

27:44.753 --> 27:47.487
I know. I know.

27:49.357 --> 27:51.391
Look, I have to go. We'll talk later.

27:51.426 --> 27:53.493
Okay, bye.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.467
Good night, Jane. Good night.

28:00.502 --> 28:02.702
How's the story coming? Great.

28:02.737 --> 28:05.438
Turns out my friends know me
better than I know myself,

28:05.474 --> 28:07.540
'cause I have a second date
with their match.

28:07.576 --> 28:09.375
Oh. And he doesn't have

28:09.411 --> 28:11.544
Genital piercings.

28:11.580 --> 28:13.413
Actually, that remains to be seen.

28:13.448 --> 28:16.282
God, I miss being 25. No, you do not.

28:16.318 --> 28:18.551
No, I don't. So 20 years, huh?

28:18.587 --> 28:20.320
Not that anyone's counting.

28:20.355 --> 28:22.422
Oh, trust me, everyone is counting.

28:22.457 --> 28:24.757
How do you do it?

28:24.793 --> 28:26.726
That...Is simple.

28:26.761 --> 28:28.628
She's smarter than I am,

28:28.663 --> 28:31.564
And I know it and I accept it.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.500
And he is kinder than I am,

28:33.535 --> 28:35.568
And I know that, and I accept that.

28:35.604 --> 28:37.737
and we got lucky

28:37.772 --> 28:39.672
And we met at the right time,

28:39.708 --> 28:41.608
And you're very handsome, and...

28:41.643 --> 28:43.610
Ugh.

28:43.645 --> 28:46.346
And my husband is eternally
patient when work intervenes.

28:46.381 --> 28:49.782
I'm sorry, my dear.
This is going to take a while.

28:49.818 --> 28:52.519
Jacqueline Carlyle.

29:21.383 --> 29:23.583
Wax play?

29:36.398 --> 29:37.730
Oh, so you're not hungry at all?

29:37.766 --> 29:39.699
I mean, I-I made reservations... nope.

29:42.337 --> 29:44.504
All right, so you're just gonna...

29:44.539 --> 29:45.738
Okay...mm...

29:47.542 --> 29:50.743
You know what?
Okay, oh, all right, um...

29:50.779 --> 29:52.512
What's wrong?

29:52.547 --> 29:54.380
I've never said this to a girl before,

29:54.416 --> 29:57.450
But you think we could
talk a little bit?

29:57.485 --> 29:59.385
Slow things down a little?

29:59.421 --> 30:02.322
Eat dinner, then dessert?

30:02.357 --> 30:03.756
There's no rush.

30:03.792 --> 30:05.425
Yeah.

30:06.461 --> 30:08.461
I'm sorry. What?

30:08.496 --> 30:11.397
Nothing. Nothing.
Talking...Talking is good.

30:11.433 --> 30:12.565
Talking's good.

30:12.601 --> 30:15.568
So...

30:15.604 --> 30:17.737
Do you like frozen yogurt?

30:17.772 --> 30:20.373
Frozen yogurt?
I love frozen yogurt, yeah.

30:20.408 --> 30:23.476
Do you do a swirl? Swirl?

30:41.371 --> 30:44.105
Hey. How was your night, Kat?

30:44.140 --> 30:45.440
Um, good. Ask me how my

30:45.475 --> 30:47.408
Anniversary dinner with my husband was.

30:47.444 --> 30:49.344
How was your anniversary dinner?

30:49.379 --> 30:51.980
I didn't have an anniversary
dinner with my husband

30:52.015 --> 30:56.384
Because I had a very long dinner
with Kylie Jenner.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.319
It seems somebody
screen-grabbed our tweet

30:58.355 --> 30:59.988
Before you had a chance to delete it

31:00.023 --> 31:01.256
And then reposted it,

31:01.291 --> 31:03.258
Which slightly interfered with our talks

31:03.293 --> 31:06.194
About her upcoming cover.

31:06.229 --> 31:08.096
Okay, what can I do?

31:08.131 --> 31:09.364
Well, I took care of Kylie,

31:09.399 --> 31:11.266
But Natalie...

31:11.301 --> 31:15.270
I've tried cheerleading,
hand-holding, tough love.

31:15.305 --> 31:17.205
And?

31:17.240 --> 31:20.074
And I want to be a good boss.

31:20.110 --> 31:21.175
And...

31:23.346 --> 31:26.948
I have to fire her.

31:26.983 --> 31:31.119
All right, I'm gonna take care of it.

31:31.154 --> 31:32.387
I knew you would.

31:39.396 --> 31:41.195
Good morning. Good morning.

31:44.434 --> 31:46.367
So did you see that guy again?

31:46.403 --> 31:49.070
I did. Cool.

31:49.105 --> 31:51.072
Did you see "wax play" girl again?

31:51.107 --> 31:53.107
Do you really want to know that?

31:53.143 --> 31:55.076
I'm just curious from
a sociological point of view.

31:55.111 --> 31:57.078
How many women can you juggle at once?

31:57.113 --> 32:00.982
Uh, I've never tried counting.
So you've lost track then?

32:02.952 --> 32:05.253
Jane, maybe we should talk,

32:05.288 --> 32:07.121
You know, not in an elevator.

32:07.157 --> 32:08.389
No, it's all good.

32:09.993 --> 32:11.192
Right.

32:16.466 --> 32:19.334
Okay, but if there anything
you want to talk about...

32:39.255 --> 32:43.391
Uh, I shouldn't have gone
into Richard's office.

32:45.095 --> 32:47.362
It's okay. I mean, it's not, but...

32:47.397 --> 32:48.429
You know that.

32:48.465 --> 32:50.098
Yeah, I know.

32:51.134 --> 32:52.333
Someone's gonna out us.

32:52.369 --> 32:55.236
Hmm? No. I mean, it won't be me.

32:55.271 --> 32:57.338
It'll probably be me or Richard.

32:57.374 --> 32:59.240
It just feels inevitable.

32:59.275 --> 33:01.909
I need that feather bolero
jacket from givenchy.

33:01.945 --> 33:03.244
Givenchy? I got that.

33:03.279 --> 33:04.979
Ooh.

33:08.151 --> 33:11.119
Hey, Michelle,
it's Sutton from "Scarlet."

33:11.154 --> 33:13.321
Yeah, we met at high tea.

33:13.356 --> 33:15.957
Uh...Yeah, I was that girl.

33:15.992 --> 33:20.261
Listen, oliver would love to get
his hands on the new bolero.

33:20.296 --> 33:21.362
You do?

33:57.000 --> 33:59.333
All right,
what do we want for dinner, sushi?

33:59.369 --> 34:00.935
Shh.

34:04.274 --> 34:06.140
I want what they have.

34:17.504 --> 34:19.804
I can't believe I have
to fire someone today.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.474
Happy Friday, you're fired.

34:22.509 --> 34:24.542
She says she looks up to me.

34:24.578 --> 34:26.543
To be fair, you did give her a chance.

34:26.580 --> 34:28.647
Yeah,
she's just not right for "scarlet."

34:28.681 --> 34:31.549
That's not your fault. Yeah, you tried.

34:31.585 --> 34:34.585
But she was the first person
I ever hired, you know?

34:34.621 --> 34:36.821
I mean, I...I think I was just
trying to make it work

34:36.857 --> 34:40.525
Even though... I knew it was inevitable.

34:41.628 --> 34:43.795
I know I'm supposed to be
this modern millennial

34:43.830 --> 34:48.699
Who can multitask
everything in her life, but...

34:48.735 --> 34:50.835
I can't do it with guys.

34:52.639 --> 34:55.639
Why is it so terrible to
want to just date one person?

34:55.676 --> 34:57.742
I mean, what's wrong with that?

34:59.846 --> 35:01.646
I want love.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.548
There, I said it.

35:03.583 --> 35:06.818
I want to be a better boss lady.

35:06.853 --> 35:11.456
I want this thing with Richard
to be less complicated...

35:11.491 --> 35:12.557
And nachos.

35:12.592 --> 35:14.559
Oh. Yeah.

35:14.594 --> 35:15.593
nachos.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.676
Kat, this is Teresa from HR.

35:31.712 --> 35:33.611
Hi. Hello.

35:35.816 --> 35:37.549
Sometimes letting someone go

35:37.584 --> 35:38.850
Can be the best thing for both of you.

35:46.793 --> 35:49.694
Natalie, hi.

35:49.730 --> 35:52.397
Why don't you take a seat?

36:01.408 --> 36:02.574
Well, hello.

36:04.544 --> 36:05.510
Hi.

36:09.483 --> 36:10.615
So...

36:13.387 --> 36:16.354
I can't do the multiple guys thing.

36:16.390 --> 36:19.391
I don't want to. I can only do one.

36:22.596 --> 36:24.396
Okay.

36:28.535 --> 36:30.735
But not with me.

36:32.606 --> 36:34.606
It's just not who you are.

36:36.843 --> 36:38.777
Well, hang on, huh?

36:38.812 --> 36:41.746
Jane, come on, we can...
we can talk about it.

36:41.782 --> 36:44.516
There's nothing to talk about.

36:44.551 --> 36:46.818
I don't want to change you, but...

36:46.853 --> 36:49.487
I don't want to change either.

36:49.523 --> 36:50.755
Right.

36:52.726 --> 36:54.726
Well...

36:54.795 --> 36:56.828
It's been fun, sloan.

36:58.732 --> 37:00.598
Yeah, it has.

37:03.637 --> 37:06.371
Bye.

37:29.863 --> 37:33.832
Okay, I think we're far away
enough from the office.

37:37.471 --> 37:39.437
Are you still mad?

37:39.473 --> 37:40.738
No, I'm not mad.

37:40.774 --> 37:43.808
I'm just so...Frustrated

37:43.844 --> 37:45.477
With how hard this is.

37:45.512 --> 37:46.711
Me too.

37:48.648 --> 37:51.683
But this...This is good.

37:51.718 --> 37:55.420
When it's just you and me and
we're away from everything else?

37:55.455 --> 37:57.455
It's so good.

37:57.524 --> 37:59.491
When I'm with you...

38:00.627 --> 38:01.626
Yeah, I know.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.567
So what are we gonna do?

38:09.603 --> 38:11.736
Just go back to keeping things separate.

38:11.771 --> 38:15.673
We don't talk when
we're at work anymore.

38:15.709 --> 38:16.741
We don't...

38:16.776 --> 38:18.510
Know each other's friends,

38:18.545 --> 38:20.345
Spend time in each other's lives?

38:23.383 --> 38:25.416
Yeah, I guess that's impossible,
isn't it?

38:25.452 --> 38:28.753
It's not impossible,
but what kind of a relationship is that?

38:35.562 --> 38:38.396
This isn't gonna work, is it?

38:38.431 --> 38:41.366
I don't want to just
walk away from this.

38:41.434 --> 38:43.401
I don't either.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.540
But...

38:48.575 --> 38:49.741
Yeah.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.380
So what are we deciding here?

39:02.522 --> 39:03.521
Okay.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.427
So this is it.

39:18.538 --> 39:21.506
Do you want to just... Go for a walk?

39:21.541 --> 39:23.741
We don't have to talk. We can just...

39:25.679 --> 39:28.346
I think I kind of want to be alone.

40:25.472 --> 40:26.838
We're coming in.

40:29.542 --> 40:30.742
Hey, munchkin.

40:30.777 --> 40:33.544
Hi. You okay?

40:33.580 --> 40:34.579
Yeah.

40:36.650 --> 40:39.651
I really miss him...

40:39.686 --> 40:40.852
And his bathtub.

40:42.889 --> 40:45.790
It was a great bathtub.

40:45.825 --> 40:47.859
But I think you're gonna be okay.

40:50.730 --> 40:52.463
I know.

40:53.933 --> 40:57.468
I think we can get all
three of us in this one too.

40:57.504 --> 40:58.770
Mm... Yeah.

40:58.805 --> 41:02.740
Excuse me so much.
I'm just gonna jump in.

41:02.776 --> 41:05.476
Okay. Oh, it's so nice.

41:05.512 --> 41:07.745
Ooh.

41:07.781 --> 41:10.515
Tiny Jane. Hey, guys.

41:14.587 --> 41:15.753
You guys,

41:15.789 --> 41:17.722
I think you should know. Yeah?
