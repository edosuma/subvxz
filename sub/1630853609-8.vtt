00:18.727 --> 00:22.648
You know, it's actually very difficult
to eat a crepe like this.

00:23.982 --> 00:28.487
But getting to hold hands
with a snack like you, so worth it.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.240
I have gift for you.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.951
- What?
- It's very, very rare.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.662
And it took me so much effort to acquire.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.331
Just hope it's not too much.

00:39.414 --> 00:42.209
- What is it?
- A strawberry Kit Kat.

00:42.793 --> 00:43.919
Only made in Japan.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.505
- They're your favorite, right?
- Yes!

00:46.588 --> 00:48.757
That is so insanely hot.

00:49.424 --> 00:53.512
Well, if you miss me this weekend,
look at this Kit Kat and think of me.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.056
That's so sweet, but I'm gonna eat this
the second you're gone.

00:56.139 --> 00:59.434
Well, I'll think of you when I'm in Paris
for my mother's birthday.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.688
Someday I'd like to meet
your family as well.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.690
Family is very important.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.943
- Are you able to see them a lot?
- Not really.

01:08.026 --> 01:12.322
I actually grew up in San Bernardino.
Most of my family is still there.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.992
That's not too far.
You must get to see them all the time.

01:17.536 --> 01:18.704
Yeah, I try.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.581
But, I mean, you know how it is.

01:21.081 --> 01:25.419
Traffic, schedules, daylight savings time.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.296
So…

01:27.963 --> 01:31.925
I love the way you trail off.
There is an incredible grace to it.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.180
I must go.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.807
Thank you so much for meeting me halfway.

01:38.891 --> 01:41.059
My pleasure. I've never been to Montreal.

01:41.143 --> 01:43.103
And I know I've only been here
for 80 minutes,

01:43.187 --> 01:45.480
but it seems like it's very beautiful.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.525
Enjoy Paris.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.610
Enjoy LA.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.627
You see it?

02:48.710 --> 02:50.462
<i>That looks like a dairy zit to me.</i>

02:50.546 --> 02:52.339
<i>Are you putting ice cream
in your cereal again?</i>

02:52.422 --> 02:54.591
When it melts,
it's the same as milk, baby.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.051
You know that.

02:57.553 --> 03:00.305
Will you hold on a second, Tanya?
I need to relocate.

03:00.389 --> 03:03.892
- Can't be caught sitting next to a snake.
- Whatever.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.686
They called Taylor Swift a snake too,

03:05.769 --> 03:08.105
and it only made her stronger.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.065
Okay, let's get started. I really--

03:10.148 --> 03:11.608
Sorry, sorry, sorry, guys.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.652
I brought treats
to make up for being so late.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.696
"Late"?
You haven't been here for four days.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.824
Yeah, I'm sorry. I lost track of time.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.410
You'd lose track of time too
if you had a hot French guy.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.329
Cousin Molly's booed up.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.248
Well, I guess I am, Howard.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.166
I guess I am "booed up."

03:28.250 --> 03:31.545
Well, something's going around,
and it's called love.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.629
Arthur was telling me

03:32.713 --> 03:35.215
about the romantic weekend
he has planned with Chelsea.

03:35.299 --> 03:39.344
And I wanted to tell you all
before I told my parents…

03:40.470 --> 03:41.722
I'm engaged.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.600
Arthur, tell us more about this trip.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.268
It's nothing, really.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.353
We're hitting up a wine tasting
in Temecula.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.232
No, come on. Don't make that sound.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.067
We're staying at a La Quinta Inn.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.652
Our room faces the parking lot.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.571
It's really not that big of a deal.

03:57.654 --> 04:01.867
Well, I think it's wonderful that
we all have such vibrant personal lives.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.118
Okay, I'll go next.

04:03.202 --> 04:06.788
Last night, I completed my menopause.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.835
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, Rhonda.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.548
- You said you wanted to talk to me?
- Yeah, come in.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.926
Okay, now,
if this is about the fridge space,

04:19.009 --> 04:21.136
the reason why I keep
my bike helmet in there is

04:21.220 --> 04:22.554
so it's cold when I put it on.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.681
Oh, no, it's not about that. Come in.

04:25.349 --> 04:29.353
I've been doing some thinking
about our family. All our cousins.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.562
How's everyone doing?

04:30.646 --> 04:32.648
You know, same old, same old.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.317
Yeah, I kinda miss everyone, you know?

04:35.400 --> 04:38.278
The last few years,
I got trapped in John's bubble,

04:38.362 --> 04:41.490
and… I lost touch with everybody.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.200
Nah, we know how busy you are.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.410
And, plus, everyone still ask about you.

04:45.494 --> 04:46.912
Even Renee?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.706
Well, you know Renee.
She's a tough cookie.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.333
But inside that cookie is

04:51.416 --> 04:54.545
an even tougher cookie
that's impossible to bite into.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.130
Yeah, Renee and I used to be
so close when we were little,

04:57.214 --> 05:00.133
and she and I just haven't spoken
since I missed her wedding.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.180
Hey, does she still host spades night
at her house?

05:05.264 --> 05:07.724
Yeah, of course.
There's actually one tonight.

05:08.767 --> 05:12.187
Hey, do you think it would be cool
if I stopped by and said hi to everyone?

05:12.271 --> 05:15.190
Are you serious?
Yes, of course. It would be so cool.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.317
Are you sure? I don't want to impose.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.112
Girl, "impose"? It's your family.

05:20.696 --> 05:23.407
Plus, I'll be there to protect you
from any shade, you know?

05:23.490 --> 05:26.577
You'll be my Baby Yoda,
and I'll be your Mandalorian.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.036
That would be so fun.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.580
I don't know who those people are though.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.914
You don't know Grogu?

05:31.874 --> 05:33.166
- Din Djarin?
- No.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.668
Okay, well, we gotta fix that.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.838
I mean, I can drive us out there,
get you up-to-date on the family,

05:37.921 --> 05:41.216
and we can watch both seasons
of <i>The Mandalorian </i>on eight-times speed.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.427
Okay. I really appreciate it, Howard.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.887
Course.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.931
Although, I'm pretty sure my car won't

05:48.015 --> 05:49.600
make it up that big hill to your house,

05:49.683 --> 05:53.145
so I'm gonna need you to walk down
to the El Pollo Loco and meet me.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.230
- Yeah, sure.
- See you tonight.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.357
See you tonight.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.360
What is El Pollo Loco?

06:08.035 --> 06:09.453
Thanks for picking that up.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.122
Just throw it in the back.
I'll have to pay you back later.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.457
Okay.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.294
Oh, my God. Is that a lizard?

06:17.377 --> 06:20.005
Yeah, that's Jessica.
I've told you about her before.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.965
Jessica's a lizard?

06:23.050 --> 06:27.387
Okay, that story you told me about her
before makes way more sense now.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.973
- Let me get you updated on the family.
- Okay.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.684
- Cousin Kelly's gay, but not out yet.
- Okay.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.687
She goes to Yosemite a lot
with her "roommate," Courtney.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.856
- We are very happy for them.
- Okay.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.484
And Uncle James,
he finally got on the Internet,

06:40.567 --> 06:42.903
so now he thinks seltzer causes cancer.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.907
Any intel on Renee?

06:48.116 --> 06:49.660
I had an idea about that.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.078
Open up the glove box.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.668
It's us at Auntie Mabel's Easter egg hunt.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.420
We must be in kindergarten.

07:00.504 --> 07:03.841
Just two cuties holding hands, being cute.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.551
That'll melt Renee's cold heart.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.846
Now close that glove box.
You letting Jessica's crickets out.

07:15.686 --> 07:18.355
Hey. I have a delivery for Sofia Salinas?

07:18.438 --> 07:19.773
Okay.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.942
- Yeah, just set it right there.
- Cool.

07:22.568 --> 07:23.694
Appreciate it.

07:25.571 --> 07:27.489
- That's different.
- Yeah.

07:27.573 --> 07:30.200
- Should we read that tiny little card?
- I don't know.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.327
Sofia is the most private person
I've ever met.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.246
I didn't even know
her last name was Salinas

07:34.329 --> 07:36.248
until two years into knowing her.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.295
I don't know.
We're on some shaky moral ground here.

07:41.378 --> 07:44.506
All right, calm down, Pippi Longstocking.
It's fine.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.260
"To my dearest Fi-fi. I crave your touch."

07:48.343 --> 07:50.220
- Does it really say that?
- Yeah.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.015
- Who are those flowers for?
- You. Maybe. We didn't look.

07:58.604 --> 08:02.399
Flowers, Jalen? Seriously?
You're gonna have to do better than that.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.484
It was my birthday three months ago.

08:04.568 --> 08:06.111
What do you expect for me to feel?

08:06.195 --> 08:09.615
Okay. We should probably go home
and give her some privacy.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.075
Yeah. I'm right behind you.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.911
"I crave your touch"? The only thing…

08:13.994 --> 08:17.080
Yeah, I just--
I lost something here at my desk,

08:17.164 --> 08:19.625
so I just-- I gotta probably sit down
and look for it…

08:19.708 --> 08:21.919
- Yeah, I'll help you look.
-…for a little bit.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.801
- Okay, here we go.
- Gonna do great.

08:29.885 --> 08:33.096
You're brave. You're strong.
And you're love.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.557
- And this is your family.
- That's right.

08:36.725 --> 08:37.976
Is that what you're wearing?

08:38.477 --> 08:39.477
What?

08:41.230 --> 08:42.356
Howard.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.316
Molly. Long time no see.

08:44.399 --> 08:48.153
Hi, Renee. Thank you so much
for letting me stop by tonight.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.115
Well, come on in.
You're gonna let the cats out.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.200
Yes.

08:54.576 --> 08:55.911
Very natural.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.915
Hey, everybody. Look who I brought.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.124
- Hi!
- Hey!

09:01.208 --> 09:03.544
Oh, my God, Cheryl.

09:04.378 --> 09:05.921
You look so beautiful.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.798
You look good too, Molly.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.801
Your skin's glowing. What's your secret?

09:10.884 --> 09:13.887
I drink lots of water
and take five naps a day.

09:13.971 --> 09:17.057
- Uncle James.
- Oops, there she is. Hollywood.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.894
Now, Uncle James, you know I have nothing
to do with the entertainment industry.

09:20.978 --> 09:25.148
Then how come I saw your divorce
on <i>Access Hollywood</i>, Hollywood?

09:25.983 --> 09:27.317
You got me there.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.111
Hey, Molly.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.737
- Hey.
- It's nice seeing you again.

09:30.821 --> 09:32.114
This is my roommate, Courtney.

09:32.823 --> 09:34.992
Yes. Hi, Courtney.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.411
Kelly. Yay.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.497
Wonderful allyship.

09:40.581 --> 09:41.582
Thank you.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.959
Rickety-ass table.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.047
Renee.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.216
I have something I want to show you.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.887
It's a picture of us from way back when.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.471
Weren't we so cute?

09:56.555 --> 09:58.891
So, you saying I'm not cute anymore?

09:59.766 --> 10:00.767
What? No.

10:00.851 --> 10:03.145
Oh, no. You're very cute.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.938
No, I was--

10:06.231 --> 10:07.774
I was just showing it, you know,

10:07.858 --> 10:10.861
to show how close we were
when we were kids.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.280
So you're also saying I'm old?

10:13.363 --> 10:15.032
I don't-- No.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.785
No.

10:20.162 --> 10:21.914
The picture was Howard's idea.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.209
Howard, is that true?

10:26.335 --> 10:28.212
I've never seen that photo before
in my life.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.339
What? It was in your glove box.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.926
You know what? Renee doesn't wanna talk
about this anymore.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.136
Renee wants to play cards.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.723
Okay. She just went into the third person.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.309
That is not a good sign.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

10:42.392 --> 10:44.603
- I am not happy with you.
- Why you mad at me?

10:44.686 --> 10:46.647
What the hell was that?
You totally sold me out.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.357
What do you mean? You sold me out first.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.858
I can't have Renee mad at me.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.610
She's my lizard-sitter
when I'm out of town.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.362
You were supposed to protect me.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.989
You were going to be my "Mungalorian."

10:56.073 --> 10:58.992
I don't know why I thought that old photo
would work. Renee's not Ken Burns.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.911
She's an assistant manager
at a Food 4 Less.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.037
Her heart is made of stone.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.081
Okay, let's just move on. All right?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.165
How do I bounce back?

11:05.249 --> 11:06.583
- Okay, I think I got a plan.
- Yeah?

11:06.667 --> 11:07.709
I think it's gonna work.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.837
- I'ma go to the store and get some ice…
- Okay.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.171
…and you're on your own.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.048
What?

11:13.131 --> 11:16.885
This is an every-man-for-himself type
situation. I cannot be drug down here.

11:16.969 --> 11:20.597
Hey, Renee. I'm gonna go get some ice.
Love you guys.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.896
I am not giving up, Auntie Mabel.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.324
I know we shouldn't be watching this,
but she is so compelling.

11:39.908 --> 11:40.909
Even when she's mad.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.578
I know. Especially when she's mad.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.038
I would watch
a whole limited series about her.

11:47.082 --> 11:49.209
You know, when I was younger,
I learned how to read lips

11:49.293 --> 11:51.753
to see if my parents were talking
about me being gay or not.

11:51.837 --> 11:52.921
I bet I could do that now.

11:53.005 --> 11:54.840
Yes.

11:56.717 --> 12:01.638
Okay, she's either saying
"relationship" or "ranch dip"?

12:01.722 --> 12:05.184
I think, from context,
it's likely to be "relationship."

12:05.267 --> 12:08.395
Okay, will you just support me right now?
I'm doing something magical.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.525
Well, looks like the show's over.

12:13.609 --> 12:15.611
I guess I should probably go
pick up my daughter.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.863
She's been at her friend's house
for five hours now.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.658
Excuse me.
Do you know where I can find Sofia?

12:27.998 --> 12:30.918
- Okay, that's gotta be Jalen, right?
- I mean, it's gotta be.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.337
Tony, what are you doing here?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.464
"Tony"?

12:42.221 --> 12:43.305
Alex, honey?

12:43.805 --> 12:46.308
Yeah, you're gonna have to stay the night
at your friend's house.

12:46.892 --> 12:47.893
Okay, bye-bye.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.153
Uh-uh. Don't put your drink on this table.
It'll fall off.

12:58.237 --> 12:59.238
Come on-- The shoe?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.537
Uh-oh.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.747
What's that song?

13:08.830 --> 13:10.374
You remember this one, Renee.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.543
That summer?

13:12.626 --> 13:16.713
We listened to it over and over again
and made everybody watch us do this dance.

13:18.382 --> 13:19.508
Hollywood!

13:19.591 --> 13:21.093
She's still got moves.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.930
Come on, Renee.
This is a two-person dance.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.723
I can't do it by myself.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.934
Unless you forgot?

13:32.104 --> 13:33.730
I would never forget…

13:34.982 --> 13:36.233
how to do this.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.002
Yes!

14:00.591 --> 14:01.842
Yeah!

14:01.925 --> 14:04.178
We gotta stop this nonsense.
Let's play some spades.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.471
Yes. Okay.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.604
- What are they saying?
- I don't know. It's all gibberish.

14:14.646 --> 14:19.026
"Dawn day velvet… Volvo."

14:19.860 --> 14:21.111
What?

14:21.195 --> 14:22.404
"Dawn day"?

14:23.238 --> 14:24.281
<i>Donde.</i>

14:24.364 --> 14:25.866
<i>Ay, Dios mío</i>, they're speaking Spanish.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.701
But this is terrible.
I don't speak Spanish.

14:27.784 --> 14:31.413
But I do.
I've got 30,000 XP on my Duolingo app.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.458
Okay, you sound out what you're seeing,
and I'll translate.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.834
Okay.

14:36.627 --> 14:42.341
"Ron's peas stay coral zone."

14:43.675 --> 14:46.845
- Who's Ron?
- Ron P. Ron. Cor--

14:47.763 --> 14:52.601
<i>Me rompiste el corazón.</i>
He's saying, "You broke my heart."

14:52.684 --> 14:54.353
Oh, my God. We did it. Yes.

14:54.853 --> 14:55.854
She broke his heart.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.565
Oh, my God, it's sad,
but it's kind of amazing what we did.

14:58.649 --> 15:00.150
Yeah, it's very compelling.

15:00.234 --> 15:01.735
- Shut up. They're still talking.
- Okay.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.153
<i>What's that?</i>

15:03.237 --> 15:04.863
Ready, set, here it comes. Bam!

15:08.575 --> 15:12.913
Wait. Remember when Uncle Corey brought
a lady to a wedding

15:12.996 --> 15:14.831
and swore she was Salma Hayek?

15:14.915 --> 15:17.709
Yes. Oh, my God,
she looked nothing like her.

15:17.793 --> 15:19.378
She had red hair.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.839
Remember he used to make us
call her Auntie Salma?

15:21.922 --> 15:22.965
Yes.

15:24.675 --> 15:25.592
Okay.

15:25.676 --> 15:28.428
What's going on here? We all friends now?

15:28.512 --> 15:29.930
Renee, you're not mad anymore?

15:30.013 --> 15:32.182
Howard, the only thing I'm mad at

15:32.266 --> 15:35.352
is how long it took
for that damn ice to get here.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.105
Well, isn't that just like Howard?

15:38.188 --> 15:40.524
Always one step behind.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.070
Yeah, I am very silly.

15:45.153 --> 15:48.740
Although it is a little hurtful
when everyone laughs at me.

15:48.824 --> 15:50.242
Well, I don't know why.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.286
You should be used to it by now.

15:57.291 --> 16:01.837
You know what? Since I'm in a better mood,
I'ma let y'all have the five-layer dip.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.797
Yeah. Honey, this ain't for everybody.

16:03.881 --> 16:05.966
- They won't get this.
- Yes!

16:17.769 --> 16:19.062
Have a good night, you guys.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.274
No, stop.
You have to tell us what's going on.

16:22.357 --> 16:23.984
Yeah, who even were those guys?

16:24.067 --> 16:26.361
Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to cause a scene.

16:26.445 --> 16:27.279
"Sorry"?

16:27.362 --> 16:30.240
This is the most interesting thing
that's ever happened in this office.

16:30.324 --> 16:32.117
What? Greta Thunberg was here last week.

16:32.201 --> 16:33.619
Who? That creepy Dutch girl?

16:33.702 --> 16:35.829
I don't give a shit about her.
I give a shit about you.

16:35.913 --> 16:37.289
I stan you so hard right now.

16:37.372 --> 16:40.751
Yeah, if stanning is a positive thing,
then I totally agree.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.837
You don't have to tell us every detail.
We want to make sure you're okay.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.714
Yeah. Are you safe? Whatever.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.549
But just talk to us.

16:54.598 --> 16:57.184
Surprise! Look what just arrived.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.520
- What's that?
- I got you a gift.

16:59.603 --> 17:02.856
It's a game table
you don't have to put your shoe under.

17:02.940 --> 17:04.441
I can put my drink on this one.

17:04.525 --> 17:07.528
It's made out of oak,
and it even has real leather.

17:07.611 --> 17:08.612
Feel it, Renee.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.820
I'm not touching that.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.742
I don't want that table in my house.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.246
But you've been complaining
about it all night.

17:17.329 --> 17:18.704
Come on. She's trying to be nice.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.040
No, she's not.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.626
She just throwing her money around
to buy us off,

17:22.709 --> 17:25.002
'cause she knows she hasn't been around.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.922
That's what she always does.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.464
Okay, that's not fair.

17:28.549 --> 17:31.134
- Yeah, Renee, she's not like that.
- Really?

17:31.218 --> 17:35.138
Then why did she skip my wedding
to go on some fancy vacation

17:35.222 --> 17:40.352
and then send me some fancy, dumbass,
colored lamp to make up for it?

17:40.435 --> 17:44.439
Well, that lamp was actually
a James Turrell light installation.

17:44.523 --> 17:47.818
Well, tell your friend James
the lamp's out back,

17:47.901 --> 17:49.486
full of dead mosquitoes.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.323
Money can't buy everything, Molly.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.493
Spades night is over.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.375
Sorry, everybody.

18:04.585 --> 18:06.003
Maybe I shouldn't have come tonight.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.088
No, she shouldn't have said
those things about you.

18:08.755 --> 18:09.965
You know what I'm gonna do?

18:10.048 --> 18:12.384
I'm gonna go in there
and give her a piece of my mind.

18:12.467 --> 18:15.012
- No, you don't have to do that.
- No, I do.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.097
This is for you, Baby Yoda.

18:20.559 --> 18:21.894
If I do not come back,

18:21.977 --> 18:24.396
I have written a comic book.
It is called <i>Ninja College</i>.

18:24.479 --> 18:27.566
It is the worst thing I've ever read.
Please delete it.

18:27.649 --> 18:28.650
Okay.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.948
Been saving this for a special occasion.

18:35.032 --> 18:38.493
It's an 18-year-old <i>añejo </i>tequila.

18:38.577 --> 18:41.538
Eighteen years?
That probably goes down so smooth.

18:50.464 --> 18:53.884
- Okay, so there are two men in my life.
- Yes! Love triangle. Keep going.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.553
The first one is Tony.
He's the one who came in today. A lawyer.

18:56.637 --> 18:59.097
Thoughtful, dependable, steady.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.975
He also came over
and organized my kitchen pantry once.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.186
Interesting. By function or color?

19:04.269 --> 19:05.854
Alphabetical.

19:05.938 --> 19:07.981
And then there's Jalen,
who brought the flowers.

19:08.065 --> 19:11.693
He's an artist,
and he just keeps me on my toes.

19:11.777 --> 19:13.862
We get it. He's good at sex. Continue.

19:13.946 --> 19:16.198
But he is so unreliable.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.784
Those flowers were for my birthday,
which was three months ago.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.327
I just don't know who's right for me.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.246
Oh, come on. Let's be honest.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.456
You're gonna pick Jalen.
You're gonna pick the artist.

19:24.540 --> 19:25.874
Well, what makes you say that?

19:25.958 --> 19:28.043
Because he's more interesting.
He's more exciting.

19:28.126 --> 19:31.338
You know, every day will be an adventure.
Those guys always win.

19:31.421 --> 19:35.634
People always like choosing
the sexy rebel, Jon Bon Jovi type.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.928
Nobody ends up choosing
the dependable guy.

19:39.555 --> 19:41.014
I'm gonna have to disagree.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.891
I've dated a lot of Jalens in my time,

19:42.975 --> 19:45.435
and it's all fun and games
until one of them robs you

19:45.519 --> 19:47.479
and pawns your watch
for a bunch of ketamine.

19:47.563 --> 19:49.439
To be fair,
I don't think he would do that.

19:49.523 --> 19:51.483
You never think they will,
but they always do.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.485
Listen, Jalen sent you flowers,

19:53.569 --> 19:56.280
but Tony's the one who cared enough
to actually show up.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.240
Which one matters more to you
in the long run?

19:58.866 --> 20:02.119
Yeah, you both have good points.
Dating is complicated as hell.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.748
You know,
I'm not mad that we did this, y'all.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.209
Wait. Who are you gonna choose?

20:09.293 --> 20:12.087
You think I'm gonna base my decision
off of what you two told me?

20:12.171 --> 20:14.214
No, I gotta talk
to my real friends about this.

20:14.298 --> 20:16.258
Wait. What are they like?

20:16.341 --> 20:18.635
None of your business.
I've shared enough tonight.

20:18.719 --> 20:21.972
Please. Just a little bit more.
Tell us about your family.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.724
Do you got any nieces or nephews?

20:24.975 --> 20:25.976
Please.

20:30.522 --> 20:33.775
Renee, you're wrong about her.
I've been working with Molly every day,

20:33.859 --> 20:36.153
and yeah, she's not perfect,
but she's trying hard.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.446
She's helping people.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.239
She's a good person.

20:39.323 --> 20:40.866
Well, if she's such a good person

20:40.949 --> 20:43.702
then why did she skip out on my wedding
and not even tell me?

20:44.286 --> 20:45.204
I mean,

20:45.287 --> 20:48.248
I know a private room
at the Olive Garden isn't Majorca,

20:48.332 --> 20:50.334
but that was the most important day
of my life.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.336
You got divorced three days later.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.129
That is not the point.

20:54.213 --> 20:56.715
It's okay, Howard. She's right.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.636
I wish I hadn't missed your wedding.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.805
And, you know what?

21:05.265 --> 21:06.642
I did try to buy you off.

21:08.435 --> 21:12.064
But I didn't go to Majorca for a vacation.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.068
You probably don't want to hear
anything I have to say,

21:16.151 --> 21:17.694
and I totally get that.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.155
Thank you.

21:22.491 --> 21:24.201
I just want to be honest with you.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.038
Right before your wedding,

21:28.872 --> 21:30.541
I was on John's iPad,

21:31.166 --> 21:34.753
and some texts came in from another woman.

21:36.505 --> 21:38.131
I confronted him,

21:38.215 --> 21:42.177
and we had a huge fight,
and I threatened to leave him.

21:43.554 --> 21:48.392
And he talked me into going to Majorca
to try to fix things.

21:50.519 --> 21:52.604
I told him I didn't want to go, but…

21:54.439 --> 21:57.276
he seems to have a way
of getting everything he wants.

21:58.819 --> 22:00.696
So we went, and…

22:02.656 --> 22:04.449
he denied everything.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.703
And I believed him.

22:11.665 --> 22:13.542
Probably because I wanted to.

22:17.171 --> 22:18.839
And that was a huge mistake…

22:21.008 --> 22:26.180
because, of course,
you know what happened next.

22:28.599 --> 22:31.476
- I wish you would have just told me.
- I know.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.438
But I was embarrassed.

22:37.107 --> 22:40.986
Everyone thought I had this perfect life.

22:41.069 --> 22:44.781
I didn't. I knew that guy was bad news.

22:44.865 --> 22:48.202
Never give a man too much money,
especially a nerd.

22:48.285 --> 22:49.953
That's the worst-case scenario.

22:53.457 --> 22:55.292
Well, you're right about that.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.003
Well, at least you're here now.

22:58.837 --> 23:00.923
I know it was probably hard
to come back here.

23:02.216 --> 23:03.550
I'm glad I did.

23:05.636 --> 23:07.763
This is so sweet. I think I'm gonna cry.

23:07.846 --> 23:09.431
Howard, why are you still here?

23:09.515 --> 23:11.725
I can hear the ice melting out there.
Go get it.

23:11.808 --> 23:13.018
Yes, ma'am.

23:20.609 --> 23:22.152
Hey, thanks for bringing me tonight.

23:23.153 --> 23:25.864
And for everything you said about me
in there. That was really nice.

23:25.948 --> 23:26.949
Well, I meant it.

23:27.783 --> 23:31.078
You're working hard to make changes,
and I know it's not easy.

23:31.161 --> 23:33.872
It's just nice to see you getting back
in touch with your roots.

23:34.915 --> 23:37.626
- Thank you, Howard.
- Don't mention it.

23:39.545 --> 23:41.463
You know, you're rising up the ranks.

23:42.256 --> 23:44.091
You're my second-favorite cousin now.

23:44.174 --> 23:45.175
What?

23:45.259 --> 23:46.969
- Who's your first?
- Cousin Keith.

23:47.052 --> 23:48.053
He's hilarious.

23:48.136 --> 23:51.515
You ever see that impression he does
of the sloth from <i>Zootopia</i>?

23:52.015 --> 23:55.561
- He's so slow.
- Don't do it now.

23:55.644 --> 23:56.770
I'm sorry.

23:56.854 --> 23:57.896
It's okay.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.157
Arthur?

24:14.371 --> 24:15.706
Thank you for your advice earlier.

24:16.748 --> 24:19.751
But I've got to let you know
I think you're wrong.

24:20.919 --> 24:24.006
I think sometimes
the dependable guy gets the girl.

24:27.593 --> 24:29.261
You think so?

24:30.637 --> 24:32.389
And between you and me,

24:33.015 --> 24:35.559
I think you have more of a chance
with her than you think.

25:11.303 --> 25:12.888
Wow.

25:13.764 --> 25:15.098
Everything okay?

25:17.100 --> 25:18.101
Yeah.

25:20.229 --> 25:23.732
Yeah, everything's… great.

25:24.816 --> 25:25.817
Well, okay, then.

25:26.610 --> 25:29.821
I'll have you in that El Pollo Loco
in 30 minutes, coz.
