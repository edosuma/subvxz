00:53.261 --> 00:55.304
This is the Earth at a time

00:55.388 --> 00:59.808
when the dinosaurs roamed
a lush and fertile planet.

01:07.525 --> 01:11.111
A piece of rock just six miles wide

01:11.196 --> 01:13.155
changed all that.

01:21.081 --> 01:25.000
It hit with the force
of 10,000 nuclear weapons.

01:28.046 --> 01:32.716
A trillion tons of dirt and rock
hurtled into the atmosphere,

01:32.801 --> 01:35.511
creating a suffocating blanket of dust

01:35.595 --> 01:38.222
the sun was powerless to penetrate

01:38.306 --> 01:40.724
for a thousand years.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.734
It happened before.

01:51.986 --> 01:53.946
It will happen again.

01:55.698 --> 01:58.408
It's just a question of when.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.223
Houston, affirmative.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.518
Now try again.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.815
Almost got it.

02:33.027 --> 02:36.738
- Atlantis, I'm almost there.
- Houston, Pete's lookin' real strong.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.075
Okay, Pete, we got that coupling
on the board here now.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.495
We'll give you the go-ahead
from down here when it's in alignment.

02:43.580 --> 02:47.332
Sounds good. Give me ten seconds.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.086
His heart rate's racing. Hey, Pete.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.671
- It's Truman.
- Hey.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.882
- How you doing up there, hoss?
- Pretty good.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.342
Listen, Pete, we got an eye
on your meds here.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.677
I'll give you a buffalo nickel

02:58.761 --> 03:00.679
if you'll calm down just a little bit.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.473
- Can you do that for me?
- Whatever you say.

03:03.558 --> 03:07.060
Okay, now, we got plenty of time,
buddy, so don't you worry.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.358
Looking good here.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.484
He'll be all right.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.612
- Go ahead, Atlantis.
- Roger that, Houston.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.447
Suggest we start reeling Pete in.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.420
- What the hell is that?
- My Lord.

03:39.802 --> 03:40.844
We're down!

03:43.806 --> 03:45.599
Houston!

03:48.019 --> 03:50.562
We've lost all contact.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.317
Stewart, play that tape back!

03:58.488 --> 04:01.323
Houston!

04:04.118 --> 04:05.744
Multiple bogies! Multiple bogies!

04:05.828 --> 04:08.914
Sector five, niner. I have three. Now five.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.041
- Unidentified tracks.
- My screen's full.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.168
Multiple tracks headed toward
the Atlantic seaboard!

04:13.253 --> 04:14.836
This could be a surprise missile attack.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.929
Mr. President, the shuttle
Atlantis just exploded in space.

04:24.013 --> 04:28.058
Okay, I want three groups!
One, internal malfunction.

04:28.142 --> 04:30.978
Get the log tape.
Start working back. Maybe it's a glitch.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.772
Two, I want NORAD,
Space Command and the 50th tactical,

04:33.856 --> 04:36.441
comparing all the space junk
you tracked in every orbit.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.986
I want you to check, recheck
and then do it all over again.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.989
Number three, wild cards.
Anything and everything.

04:42.073 --> 04:45.575
All right? Now, Big Ross, get on
the telephone. Wake up 11,000 people.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.119
- Walt, get 'em going.
- Let's go!

04:47.203 --> 04:52.040
Karl. Karl! Karl.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.962
Karl! Your Stouffer's pot pie's

04:57.046 --> 04:59.631
been on the table almost ten hours.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.009
- I want a divorce.
- Dottie, I'm on to something big here.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.429
I... I don't know what this is, but it
looks like something's burnin' up there.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.347
Go get my phone book, will you?
Get my phone book.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.349
Get those names
of those guys from NASA.

05:09.434 --> 05:14.396
Excuse me! Am I wearing a sign
that says, "Karl's Slave"?

05:14.480 --> 05:17.649
Go get my goddamn phone book!

05:17.734 --> 05:20.944
Get the book! Get the book!
Get the book!

05:25.575 --> 05:29.161
Space Command is reporting negative.
That is zero global launches.

05:29.245 --> 05:31.496
It might just be a piece of the shuttle
breaking up as it comes in.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.789
It might be Santa Claus.

05:32.874 --> 05:36.126
Until we get definitive,
reliable confirmation, General,

05:36.210 --> 05:38.378
we go to DEFCON Three.

05:43.509 --> 05:47.054
I'm gettin' ready for the big time

05:47.138 --> 05:50.557
Someday you're gonna say
I'm big time, too

05:51.934 --> 05:54.019
Hey, little man! Little Richard!

05:54.103 --> 05:56.688
Me and you, man!
We're going to the top, baby!

05:56.773 --> 06:00.776
Big time! I ain't gonna be ridin'
this bike for the rest of my life.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.236
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm gettin' a motorcycle, baby.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.447
We're gonna travel in style.

06:06.449 --> 06:10.285
I'm gettin' ready for the big time

06:10.370 --> 06:12.871
Someday I'm gonna be in big time news

06:12.955 --> 06:16.875
Watch where you're goin'. I bet you,
none of you all stop for brothers.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.627
Slow down, Little Richard.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.921
You've been ridin' all morning.
You gotta take a dump?

06:23.383 --> 06:25.133
We interrupt our regularly
scheduled program...

06:25.218 --> 06:26.551
- What happened?
... to bring you this special report.

06:27.762 --> 06:32.307
The shuttle ATLantis exploded in space
at 3:47 a. m., Eastern Standard Time.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.522
Hey! Get, get.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.319
- That's my Godzilla. Come on, now.
- Yo, fool!

06:44.404 --> 06:46.571
Don't be kickin' Little Richard.
What the hell your problem?

06:46.656 --> 06:49.908
That dog's eatin' my Godzilla. What's
a little runt like you gonna do about it?

06:49.992 --> 06:52.077
Get him, Richard. Sic him.
If I wasn't no Christian,

06:52.161 --> 06:56.123
I'd be throwin' your fat pineapple-eatin'
ass through the window.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.511
Why we not going?

07:09.595 --> 07:11.596
You know why?
'Cause this is New York City.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.975
Anything could happen. Let's see.
Could've been a terrorist bomb.

07:15.059 --> 07:18.437
Could've been a dead body. Somebody
shot, stabbed, and it's Friday, payday.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.605
Dude, somebody probably didn't
get their paycheck. Yes?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.149
I want to go shopping.

07:22.233 --> 07:26.653
Me, too, but we ain't goin' nowhere
'cause this is a traffic jam.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.822
- Little Richard!
- Right over there!

07:30.074 --> 07:31.992
Little Richard!

07:32.076 --> 07:33.952
Hang on, Little Richard. I'm comin'!

07:35.705 --> 07:38.415
Don't you worry about it.
I'm gonna get you outta there!

07:38.499 --> 07:41.543
You okay, buddy?
Don't worry about it. Hang in there.

07:42.378 --> 07:44.629
Somebody dial 911!

07:44.714 --> 07:46.673
My screen's full.
They're all over the place.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.133
Bogies are breachin' the atmosphere

07:48.217 --> 07:50.343
from Finland down
the North American seaboard.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.444
Look at that!

08:13.659 --> 08:15.785
Oh, we at war!

08:18.164 --> 08:19.748
Saddam Hussein is bombing us!

09:14.971 --> 09:16.012
Let's stay focused. We need to

09:16.097 --> 09:18.056
- map the trajectory now.
- That could take a week.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.642
Just find it, okay? I wanna know if
the worst is over or if it's on its way.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.435
We've got General Kimsey on the line.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.397
We've got hits from Finland
to South Carolina.

09:25.481 --> 09:27.148
We know they're not missiles.
Now what the hell is it?

09:27.233 --> 09:30.652
It's a meteor shower.
That's what took out the shuttle.

09:33.781 --> 09:36.116
I've got the president
on AirForce One demanding answers.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.577
Is it over?

09:38.661 --> 09:42.163
General, we've got 11,000 people at
NASA trying to figure that out right now.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.248
When we know, you'll know.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.922
Okay, Karl, listen.
I want you to take your time.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.465
Yes, sir. You're definitely the first.

09:52.550 --> 09:57.596
Okay, first coordinate.
One-two-three-nine. 1239, right?

09:58.598 --> 10:01.725
- F.B.I. locked his location.
- Saw an explosion in space.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.268
Okay.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.188
- Listen, Karl, this is top secret.
- Sir, I'm retired Navy.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.317
I know all about classified.
But one more thing.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.319
The person that finds her
gets to name her, right?

10:12.403 --> 10:16.865
- Yes, that's right.
- I wanna name her Dottie, after my wife.

10:16.949 --> 10:20.785
She's a vicious life-suckin' bitch
from which there's no escape.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.622
- That's sweet, Karl.
- S.D.I., this is flight director!

10:23.706 --> 10:25.415
I wanna get that Hubble movin',
and I want it now.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.875
Roger that.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.209
We're movin' the Hubble!

10:34.967 --> 10:36.259
It's enormous.

10:36.344 --> 10:40.388
This is the anomaly at 1643.

10:41.807 --> 10:45.727
Here is the anomaly at 1658,

10:45.811 --> 10:49.481
and here is the anomaly at 1700.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.484
Enough with this anomaly horseshit!

10:52.568 --> 10:55.487
- What is this thing?
- It's an asteroid, sir.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.323
How big are we talking?

10:58.407 --> 11:00.367
Sir, our best estimate is 97.6 billion...

11:00.451 --> 11:03.453
- It's the size of Texas, Mr. President.
- Y-Yes, sir.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.997
Dan, we didn't see this thing coming?

11:06.082 --> 11:08.291
Well, our object collision
budget's a million dollars.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.502
That allows us to track
about three percent of the sky.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.962
And begging your pardon, sir,
it's a big-ass sky.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.714
- And the ones this morning?
- Those are nothing.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.508
They're the size of basketballs

11:16.592 --> 11:18.343
and Volkswagens, things like that.

11:18.427 --> 11:23.181
- Is this going to hit us?
- We're efforting that as we speak, sir.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.934
- What kind of damage are we...
- Damage?

11:27.228 --> 11:29.396
Total, sir.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.898
It's what we call a global killer.

11:31.982 --> 11:34.192
The end of mankind.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.194
Doesn't matter where it hits.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.863
Nothing would survive.
Not even bacteria.

11:38.948 --> 11:42.659
My God. What do we do?

11:51.752 --> 11:55.004
We have 18 days before it hits Earth.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.558
Have mercy

12:06.642 --> 12:08.226
Rise and shine!

12:10.354 --> 12:13.565
Stop the drilling!
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!

12:13.649 --> 12:16.067
Fore!

12:16.152 --> 12:18.069
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!

12:18.154 --> 12:21.072
- Hey!
- Hey, that was close!

12:24.785 --> 12:27.829
I give you 50,000 a year in donations.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.414
What do you think
they're so mad about, Chick?

12:29.498 --> 12:32.375
Well, I think they feel that
drilling for oil is an evil thing.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.295
You know how much diesel
that clunker boat pumps out an hour?

12:35.379 --> 12:40.759
I just found out something interesting.
Number two chewed 180 feet last night.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.261
- Who do we have to thank for this?
- I'll give you two guesses.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.180
But you're only gonna need one.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.515
Goddamn it, A.J.!

12:47.600 --> 12:49.517
A.J.!

12:51.979 --> 12:54.856
A.J.! A.J., you in here?

12:54.940 --> 12:57.650
Oh, that's just perfect. In bed. Get up!

12:57.735 --> 13:01.780
- Uh, hey, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah, I was lookin' for ya.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.615
You're pissed. Okay, I can see that.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.826
No. You know what, A.J.?
I'm not pissed. You've seen me pissed.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.745
This is way, way beyond pissed, though.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.914
You know I shut down
number two last night, right?

13:10.998 --> 13:13.541
- Yeah, man, I had a hunch on that.
- Let me tell you something.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.419
Someday, many years from now,
when you're all growed up,

13:16.504 --> 13:17.837
and you got your own oil company

13:17.922 --> 13:20.799
and $8 million of your own money
on the contract,

13:20.883 --> 13:24.511
you can do whatever comes into that
little A.J. -idiotin' mind of yours you want.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.763
But as long as it says
"Harry Stamper Oil" on the rig,

13:26.847 --> 13:28.139
you will not disobey my rules.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.099
- You got that?
- Yeah, I do got it.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.393
All right, now I need to hear
five words from you.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.687
- Uh...
- I'll...

13:34.772 --> 13:36.815
Never do that again.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.400
I'm a fool. That was idiotic.
I... I mean, that was stupid.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.152
I'm an idiot. I know
what name's on the sign. I'm not...

13:41.237 --> 13:42.987
- What's goin' on here?
- What's goin' on?

13:43.072 --> 13:44.948
Well, I mean, you know,
I screwed up. I'm a little edgy.

13:45.032 --> 13:48.243
- How long you work for me?
- Five wonderful years.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.412
In five years, you have never
apologized to me this quickly.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.498
Something's going on here.
I'm gonna find out what it is.

13:53.582 --> 13:56.292
Well, I'm turning over a new leaf.

13:56.377 --> 13:57.502
I'm trying to learn from the man.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.671
What would Harry do?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.178
I'm at a loss for words.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.014
Okay, I can explain this.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.558
- You can explain that?
- I can.

14:11.642 --> 14:15.270
I would really like an explanation.
You just stay right here.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.861
Grace?

14:23.404 --> 14:24.821
Hi, Harry.

14:24.905 --> 14:28.116
I have asked you repeatedly
to call me Dad.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.576
Sorry, Harry.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.953
Get up and get your clothes on.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.375
You just stay right there.
I'll be right back.

14:44.466 --> 14:47.010
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want every strategy we've got

14:47.094 --> 14:48.386
on near-Earth object collision.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.889
Okay? Any ideas, any programs,

14:50.973 --> 14:54.017
anything you sketched
on a pizza box or cocktail napkin.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.102
For 30 years,
they questioned the need for NASA.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.312
Today, we're gonna give 'em
the answer.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.359
You know about this, Rockhound?

15:03.444 --> 15:06.154
- You knew?
- No, I had no idea.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.991
Where's Harry?

15:10.075 --> 15:13.328
Harry, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I understand, okay?

15:13.412 --> 15:15.663
You're mad.
Who... Who wouldn't be mad?

15:15.748 --> 15:17.749
- He's gonna shoot you.
- Nah, no, he's not.

15:17.833 --> 15:18.875
Oh, shit.

15:22.046 --> 15:25.006
- Harry!
- What's wrong with you?

15:25.090 --> 15:27.091
Make your peace with God, A.J.!

15:27.176 --> 15:29.469
This guy's got a gun, man.
He's shooting at me.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.262
Harry, this is not funny!

15:31.347 --> 15:33.806
Harry, listen to me!
We can talk this over!

15:33.891 --> 15:37.185
- Oh, is this a serious thing?
- Yeah, pretty serious.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.436
- Bear!
- What's up?

15:38.520 --> 15:40.855
He's shootin' at me. You see Harry
comin', crack him with that wrench.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.150
You told A.J.'s dad just before he died
that you would take care of the boy.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.527
Now I'm not sure that
shootin' him is takin' care of him.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.695
Why don't you put the gun down?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.656
You don't want none of this.
Get out of my way.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.950
Just tryin' to give my man
a head start, that's all.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.284
Not to mention the fact that I don't think

15:53.369 --> 15:54.953
you wanna kill
the best man on your crew,

15:55.037 --> 15:57.455
- before we strike oil.
- Aw, Chick, I ain't gonna kill him.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.291
Just gonna take a foot off.
A man can work with one foot.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.294
You remember old Frank Marx who
worked with one hand all them years?

16:03.379 --> 16:04.587
Yeah, but he wasn't very good.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.423
Harry, put the gun down!
You're acting insane!

16:07.508 --> 16:10.051
Now, honey, go get some clothes on
and get out of the way.

16:10.135 --> 16:14.305
- You can't control my life!
- Fine. Clothes. Now!

16:14.390 --> 16:15.556
All right, stop! All right!

16:15.641 --> 16:17.600
It was funny for a minute.
It's not funny anymore.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.563
- Fuck!
- Harry, this is illegal, man.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.816
I'm temporarily insane, Rock.
It's all right.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.656
- Do I look like I'm crazy to you?
- Well...

16:31.740 --> 16:33.825
Harry! Hey, just cool down.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.411
What are you doing?
Harry, stop! Cut it out.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.496
- All right, Harry.
- All right, now, listen.

16:38.580 --> 16:42.250
Man to man. I'm serious. I love her.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.252
Way wrong answer!

16:47.089 --> 16:49.841
- Whoa, whoa, Harry. It's gettin' real.
- Harry! Come on, Harry!

16:49.925 --> 16:52.552
- You shot me!
- You shot him.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.512
That bullet never got close.
Just a ricochet.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.056
You know, it's all funny
till somebody gets shot in the leg!

16:57.141 --> 17:01.102
Hey, pucker up.
We got clients incoming.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.522
Uh, b-back in-in... In 1974,

17:05.607 --> 17:07.150
we-we first got the idea

17:07.233 --> 17:09.109
the-the possibility
that-that a meteor or an asteroid...

17:09.194 --> 17:11.945
I need somebody who's had a little less
caffeine this morning. Doc, translate.

17:12.031 --> 17:16.951
Yes, sir. Our first feasibility plan was
to use a spread-focus laser generator

17:17.036 --> 17:18.994
to heat the object
to the point of fracture.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.622
That's like shooting a B.B. gun
at a freight train, Doc.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.332
Uh, some of us have got this idea.

17:23.416 --> 17:26.919
We wanna land a craft,
deploy solar sails.

17:27.003 --> 17:32.633
You'll have a big canopy. Solar winds
will be caught by these Mylar sails.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.553
- Okay...
- Come on, guys!

17:35.637 --> 17:39.307
We gotta come up with something
realistic here. We got 18 days.

17:39.391 --> 17:43.186
That's 431 hours, 15 minutes
and 18 seconds.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.813
Time's a luxury we don't have. What?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.818
Listen, Harry, A.J. is my choice.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.403
My choice and not yours.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.405
He's the only one in
your age bracket, Grace.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.407
It's not a choice. It's a lack of options.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.951
I don't know
what in the world makes you think

17:59.036 --> 18:01.662
that you have the right
to tell me what to do anymore, Harry.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.706
I suppose being your father
doesn't count, huh?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.583
- Not really.
- Since when?

18:05.667 --> 18:08.920
Since I reached the age of ten
and became older than you, Harry.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.297
Since Mom split.
Why don't you take your pick?

18:11.381 --> 18:13.925
Look, I understand that
you are handicapped

18:14.009 --> 18:16.719
by natural immaturity, and I forgive you.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.722
I may be an immature father,
but I'm still your employer.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.766
And as your boss,
I want you on that crew boat tonight

18:21.850 --> 18:22.975
and back in the office by Monday.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.020
- You got that?
- Okay. I quit.

18:26.563 --> 18:29.107
Grace, you can't quit now!

18:29.191 --> 18:30.274
I need you to keep on working.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.738
Hi, Harry!

18:35.823 --> 18:36.823
What are you smilin' about?

18:39.076 --> 18:42.703
I've been seein' A.J.
for more than five months, Harry.

18:44.581 --> 18:47.375
You little hypocrite. I ever held you
back once from doing anything?

18:47.459 --> 18:49.043
What about having a life, Harry?

18:49.128 --> 18:50.419
The first time I got my period,

18:50.504 --> 18:52.839
Rockhound had to take me
into Taipei for Tampax

18:52.923 --> 18:55.216
and then he had to show me
how to use 'em, Harry.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.510
Ho-ho.

18:57.594 --> 19:01.389
I ju... No, I... I told her how to use it.
I didn't show her, Harry.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.517
I was playing with
titanium depth gauges

19:04.601 --> 19:06.352
when I should've been
playing with dolls.

19:06.436 --> 19:10.523
I mean, I learned about the birds and
the bees from Freddy Noonan's tattoos.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.317
Look, I was raised
on roughnecks by you.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.320
And now you get all shocked
and shaken when I fall in love with one.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.239
So who's the hypocrite here,
Harry, huh?

19:18.323 --> 19:19.574
Look at those nice pipes.

19:19.658 --> 19:23.035
- Listen to me, Grace.
- No, you listen to me, Harry. I grew up.

19:24.079 --> 19:27.665
With the proximity
of the asteroid and no prep time,

19:27.749 --> 19:29.625
none of our primary plans can work.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.838
Why don't we just send up 150 nuclear
warheads and blast that rock apart?

19:33.922 --> 19:35.381
Terrible idea.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.508
Was I talkin' to you?

19:37.593 --> 19:39.510
This is Dr. Ronald Quincy
from Research.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.680
Pretty much the smartest man on the
planet. You might wanna listen to him.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.807
General, if you consider your target,

19:44.892 --> 19:47.560
her composition, her dimensions,

19:47.644 --> 19:49.478
her sheer velocity,

19:49.563 --> 19:51.189
you could fire every nuke
you've got on her,

19:51.273 --> 19:54.275
she'll just smile at you
and keep on coming.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.861
You should know that
the president's scientific advisors

19:56.945 --> 20:01.324
are suggesting that a nuclear blast
could change this asteroid's trajectory.

20:01.408 --> 20:05.203
I know the president's chief scientific
advisor. We were at M.I.T. together.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.330
And, in a situation like this...

20:07.414 --> 20:08.915
You really don't wanna take the advice

20:08.999 --> 20:12.084
from a man who got
a C-minus in astrophysics.

20:12.794 --> 20:17.381
The president's advisors are wrong.
I'm right.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.301
Hitting the rock from
the outside won't do the job.

20:20.385 --> 20:23.512
Imagine a firecracker
in the palm of your hand.

20:23.597 --> 20:27.558
You set it off. What happens?
Burn your hand, right?

20:27.643 --> 20:31.354
You close your fist around
the same firecracker and set it off...

20:31.438 --> 20:35.983
Poof! Your wife's gonna be opening your
ketchup bottles the rest of your life.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.236
Are you suggesting that we blow
this thing up from the inside?

20:38.320 --> 20:40.446
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- How?

20:40.530 --> 20:42.865
We drill.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.076
We bring in the world's best
deep-core driller.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.662
Harry, get up here. We're takin' a hit.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.497
- Get A.J. up here!
- Come on!

20:49.581 --> 20:50.581
Oh, shit!

20:51.875 --> 20:54.085
Send another pipe down! Right now!

20:55.545 --> 20:56.796
It's a gas pocket!

20:56.880 --> 20:59.507
I told you! Am I lucky,
or am I just a genius?

20:59.591 --> 21:02.635
I shut it down for a reason,
you jackass! The relief valve's...

21:05.597 --> 21:09.976
Shut off the number two valve!
Grace, get the clients out of here now!

21:12.396 --> 21:13.938
No, Daddy!

21:16.275 --> 21:19.193
Chick, get 'em outta here!
Get 'em off the rig now!

21:24.533 --> 21:27.702
- Get the hell down!
- This thing is gonna blow.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.421
Chick, get down now!

21:38.505 --> 21:41.799
Get down!

21:41.883 --> 21:43.009
Three dozen research calls,

21:43.093 --> 21:44.969
and every time,
the same man is recommended.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.305
He's worked on every terrain
this planet can offer.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.557
Whenever they said it couldn't be
drilled, this guy drilled it.

21:49.641 --> 21:53.477
- Everybody all right?
- We struck oil, baby!

21:53.562 --> 21:55.646
Somebody could've got killed
out here today.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.523
You want that on your conscience?

21:59.693 --> 22:01.569
High thumb. You are man, Harry.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.029
Thumbs high.

22:07.075 --> 22:08.576
You're fired.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.000
Who's Harry Stamper?

22:16.084 --> 22:18.836
Hey, I'm Harry Stamper.
What's all this about?

22:18.920 --> 22:22.506
Mr. Stamper, I'm General Montgomery,
commander of the Pacific Air Forces.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.633
I've been sent here
by the Secretary of Defense

22:24.718 --> 22:27.845
on direct orders
from the President of the United States.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.848
It's a matter of urgent national security.

22:30.932 --> 22:34.435
I need you to get on that chopper
right now, no questions asked.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.228
Crazy Willie put you up to this?

22:36.313 --> 22:40.775
I'm afraid I don't know Crazy Willie,
sir. I'm dead serious about this.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.195
- Harry.
- What?

22:44.279 --> 22:46.822
I swear to God,
she never told me her age.

22:46.907 --> 22:50.451
It's all right. Relax. It's about me.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.536
Oh. Forget it!

22:57.000 --> 23:00.961
All right, General,
I'll go with you on one condition.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.963
We're gonna have
to take my daughter along.

23:05.717 --> 23:06.717
What did I do?

23:06.802 --> 23:07.885
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you guys takin' her?

23:07.969 --> 23:10.513
- Sir, stay right here.
- Wh...

23:10.597 --> 23:13.140
Chick, get him paid, get him off the rig!

23:23.402 --> 23:26.487
- Mr. Stamper?
- Yeah, I'm Harry Stamper.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.864
How you doin'? Miss Stamper.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.658
I'm Dan Truman,
Executive Director here.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.910
Listen, on behalf of all of us,
I'd really like to apologize...

23:32.994 --> 23:35.704
Apologize. I don't know if we can take
any more apologies, Mr. Truman.

23:35.789 --> 23:38.707
We've been apologized to
for the last 18-and-a-half hours.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.085
So if you don't mind, how about
if we just get on with it?

23:41.169 --> 23:43.838
You tell us why we're here
at the NASA Space Center.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.756
We should probably talk alone.

23:45.841 --> 23:48.676
Mr. Truman, I don't keep
any secrets from my daughter, Grace.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.636
So whether you tell her now
or I tell her later,

23:50.720 --> 23:52.096
she's gonna find out
one way or the other.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.722
So, why don't we just get on with it?

23:54.057 --> 23:56.225
So when the Rogue comet
hit the asteroid belt,

23:56.309 --> 23:58.185
it sent shrapnel right for us.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.938
For the next 15 days,
the Earth's in a shooting gallery.

24:01.022 --> 24:05.109
Even if the asteroid itself
hits the water, it's still hitting land.

24:05.193 --> 24:07.778
It'll flash boil
millions of gallons of seawater

24:07.863 --> 24:10.281
and slam into the ocean bedrock.

24:10.365 --> 24:13.784
Now, if it's a Pacific Ocean impact,
which we think it will be,

24:13.869 --> 24:16.787
it'll create a tidal wave three miles high,

24:16.872 --> 24:18.414
traveling at 1,000 miles an hour

24:18.498 --> 24:21.834
covering California
and washing up in Denver.

24:21.918 --> 24:25.421
Japan's gone. Australia's wiped out.

24:25.505 --> 24:28.424
Half the world's population
will be incinerated by the heat blast.

24:28.508 --> 24:31.469
The rest'll freeze to death
from nuclear winter.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.512
That's unbelievable.

24:34.681 --> 24:37.558
Well, actually, this is as real as it gets.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.938
Well, it's coming right now.

24:43.023 --> 24:46.066
Right for us at 22,000 miles an hour.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.736
Not a soul on Earth can hide from it.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.254
I take it you're not
alerting everyone like this.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.508
Nobody knows. That's the way it stays.

25:10.592 --> 25:13.344
For the next ten days, there are
only nine telescopes in the world

25:13.428 --> 25:15.930
that can spot the asteroid,
and we control eight of 'em.

25:16.014 --> 25:19.016
The president's classified
this information top secret.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.726
If news like this got out,

25:20.810 --> 25:24.230
there'd be an overnight breakdown
of basic social services worldwide.

25:24.314 --> 25:29.693
Rioting, mass religious hysteria,
total chaos, you can imagine.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.780
Basically the worst parts of the Bible.

25:35.408 --> 25:38.744
Six billion people on the planet.

25:38.828 --> 25:40.788
Why'd you guys call me?

25:41.623 --> 25:42.665
We need you to prep the team

25:42.749 --> 25:44.416
- we're sending up.
- Up?

25:44.501 --> 25:45.709
We'll send them to the asteroid,

25:45.794 --> 25:48.254
they'll land, drill a hole,
they'll drop some nukes,

25:48.338 --> 25:51.048
take off and detonate,
if we can fix this equipment problem.

25:51.132 --> 25:55.886
The drilling unit's a prototype we've
been building for the Mars project.

25:55.971 --> 25:59.181
You, uh... You might recognize the rig.

26:00.642 --> 26:04.520
Yeah, well, I guess
I should recognize it. It's my design.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.400
Did you steal a key to the Patent Office?

26:09.484 --> 26:10.651
Yeah, basically.

26:10.735 --> 26:13.821
Let me get this straight.
I got pulled off an oil rig,

26:13.905 --> 26:17.116
flown halfway around the world
because you stole my drill design.

26:17.200 --> 26:21.036
Couldn't read the plans right and did
a pisspoor job of putting it together.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.581
- Patents don't apply to outer space.
- You shut up, Quincy.

26:23.665 --> 26:27.084
It's not going to Mars anymore.
It's gonna try to save this planet.

26:27.168 --> 26:29.211
And we need to know
what's wrong with it pretty quick.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.255
You said we did a bad job
of putting it together?

26:31.339 --> 26:34.842
No, I said you did a pisspoor job
of putting it together.

26:34.926 --> 26:38.470
First of all, you got the flow system
all reversed. Let me guess.

26:38.555 --> 26:41.557
You've been tearin' up rotors
and you can't figure out why.

26:41.641 --> 26:42.683
Yeah, that's right.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.561
Well, that's because your cams
are all wrong, Mr. Wizard.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.980
Who's been operating this thing?

26:48.064 --> 26:50.566
- Right there.
- We've actually...

26:50.650 --> 26:52.860
We've had them training
for eight months solid now.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.653
Eight whole months?

26:54.738 --> 26:57.031
- Well, pretty much, yeah.
- Well, gee whiz.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.408
Well, this is the team
that has to do the job up there.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.577
We need you to train them down here.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.621
Well, Mr. Stamper, what do you think?

27:03.705 --> 27:06.290
You know, drilling's a science.
It's an art.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.917
I'm a third generation driller,
doin' it all my life.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.295
I still haven't got it all figured out.

27:11.379 --> 27:15.007
I assume you sent for me because
somebody told you I was the best.

27:15.091 --> 27:17.635
Well, I'm only the best
because I work with the best.

27:17.719 --> 27:21.472
You don't trust the men you're working
with, you're as good as dead.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.974
Now you wanna send
these boys into space, fine.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.726
I'm sure they'll make good astronauts,

27:25.810 --> 27:28.520
but they don't knowjack about drillin'.

27:28.605 --> 27:31.273
- What's your contingency plan?
- Contingency plan?

27:31.358 --> 27:34.193
Your backup plan. You gotta have
some kind of backup plan, right?

27:34.277 --> 27:35.653
No, we don't have a backup plan.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.363
- This is it.
- This is the best that you could...

27:37.447 --> 27:41.158
That the government...
The U.S. government can come up with.

27:41.242 --> 27:44.536
I mean, you're NASA for cryin' out loud.
You put a man on the moon.

27:44.621 --> 27:47.873
You're geniuses.
You're the guys that think this shit up.

27:47.957 --> 27:50.501
I'm sure you got a team of men
sittin' around somewhere right now,

27:50.585 --> 27:52.961
just thinkin' shit up
and somebody backin' them up.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.171
You tell me
you don't have a backup plan,

27:54.255 --> 27:55.714
that these eight Boy Scouts right here,

27:55.799 --> 27:58.676
that is the world's hope,
that's what you're tellin' me?

27:58.760 --> 28:02.346
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jesus. Damn it.

28:03.098 --> 28:06.642
We're a little short on time here.
Will you help us?

28:11.064 --> 28:13.816
- All they gotta do is drill?
- That's it.

28:13.900 --> 28:16.694
No spacewalkin',
no crazy astronaut stuff.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.112
Just drill.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.074
How many men were you
plannin' on takin' up there?

28:22.158 --> 28:24.201
We're sendin' up
two shuttles, two teams.

28:24.285 --> 28:26.537
If I do this,
I'm gonna wanna take my own men.

28:26.621 --> 28:28.789
You got it.

28:28.873 --> 28:32.793
- So you're saying you'll help us?
- Yes, sir.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.045
Thanks.

28:42.011 --> 28:44.972
I just don't trust
anybody else to do it, that's all.

28:48.309 --> 28:49.435
No, Mrs. Curlene.

28:49.519 --> 28:54.440
It's Harry Stamper. You see Bear,
you tell him Harry's lookin' for him.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.734
Those guys get off this rig, they scatter.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.610
Jayotis Kerleen Bear.

28:58.695 --> 29:02.740
Probably the only black man
on a big dog in Kadoka, South Dakota.

29:02.824 --> 29:05.325
Come and get Papa Bear!

29:07.495 --> 29:10.664
- Uh, Max.
- You got a weight limit on the shuttle?

29:12.709 --> 29:14.918
- Max.
- Hey, Mama.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.755
So sweet, Maxie.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.048
Hey, would you give me one of them
yellowjelly bear claws I like?

29:20.133 --> 29:22.718
- Are you in trouble with the law again?
- No, Mama.

29:22.802 --> 29:25.053
- Maxie.
- I swear, Mama. I'm...

29:27.724 --> 29:28.766
You know I want Rockhound.

29:28.850 --> 29:32.603
We call him Hound because,
well, he's horny.

29:34.731 --> 29:38.025
You might wanna start
with every bar in New Orleans.

29:38.109 --> 29:41.069
That is a big, shiny mount, isn't it?

29:41.154 --> 29:43.155
- How long you been married?
- For two weeks.

29:43.239 --> 29:45.866
- See this diamond?
- Yeah.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.242
It's not a diamond.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.994
- Would you like another drink?
- Yeah.

29:49.078 --> 29:51.705
- Sir, F.B.I.
- So cute. No, thanks.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.541
- We have a national security matter.
- Good for you.

29:54.626 --> 29:59.171
- Let's go. Now.
- How old are you?

29:59.255 --> 30:02.800
Oscar Choi. Spacy but
absolutely brilliant geologist.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.803
He owns a horse ranch
outside of El Paso.

30:08.056 --> 30:10.015
What the...

30:11.935 --> 30:14.603
Mr. Chick Chapple, at the craps table.

30:14.687 --> 30:17.481
Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas, Nevada.

30:17.565 --> 30:20.359
Yes! About time.

30:20.443 --> 30:22.653
Charles Chapple, game's over.

30:26.616 --> 30:30.536
Who's gonna run the other rig?
How about Benny? He's good.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.539
The only one who knows how
to run it as well as I do is A.J.

30:33.623 --> 30:36.041
I thought you said
you couldn't trust him.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.709
I thought you said I could.

30:39.796 --> 30:42.506
Yep, you are on your way, A.J.

30:42.590 --> 30:46.218
Well, being in business
for yourself has its advantages.

30:46.302 --> 30:49.638
Make my own hours,
nobody shoots me in the leg.

30:51.140 --> 30:53.016
You don't got a gun
on you now, do you?

30:53.101 --> 30:56.270
Oh, good, 'cause I kinda wanted
to get back to this whole thing

30:56.354 --> 30:58.772
about you askin' me for help.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.858
Does that mean that there's a job

31:00.942 --> 31:05.362
that Mr. All-Go-No-Quit-Big-Nuts
Harry Stamper

31:05.446 --> 31:09.867
can't handle by himself
and needs my expert advice?

31:09.951 --> 31:11.159
Somethin' like that, yeah.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.744
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:12.829 --> 31:16.540
I mean, is it something
like that, or is it that?

31:16.624 --> 31:19.376
You know, you and me
got a real problem.

31:19.460 --> 31:22.546
You know, Harry, there are only

31:22.630 --> 31:25.632
five words I wanna hear
from you right now.

31:25.717 --> 31:26.758
Those words are:

31:26.843 --> 31:30.220
You know, A.J., I really look up to you.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.848
You've been a hero of mine
for a long time,

31:32.932 --> 31:34.266
and I'm very impressed with your work.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.393
I'm emotionally closed off.

31:36.477 --> 31:38.562
That's like...
That's like 11 words or something.

31:38.646 --> 31:42.065
You know what?
How about just, "A.J., I'm sorry,

31:42.150 --> 31:45.068
- and I love ya. "
- You know, A.J.,

31:45.153 --> 31:48.488
there's not a job on the planet
I want you to work with me on.

31:50.491 --> 31:52.409
I mean that.

31:53.995 --> 31:57.497
So what are you doin' here?
Harry, what's the job?

32:00.418 --> 32:02.502
- Hey, Bear.
- What's up, baby?

32:02.587 --> 32:04.671
Yeah, baby. What's up? What's up?

32:07.550 --> 32:10.427
What's up, Harry?
Did NASA find oil on Uranus, man?

32:19.020 --> 32:22.439
None of you have to go.
We can just sit here on Earth,

32:22.523 --> 32:25.275
wait for this big rock to crash into it

32:25.360 --> 32:27.736
and kill everything
and everybody we know.

32:29.197 --> 32:33.283
The United States government
just asked us to save the world.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.161
- Anybody wanna say no?
- Twenty years.

32:37.372 --> 32:41.875
Haven't turned you down once.
I'm not about to start now.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.835
I'm there.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.213
Guess I can't let you go up there alone.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.048
I'm with you.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.968
I mean, this is... This is historic.

32:51.052 --> 32:54.304
Guys, this is like deep blue hero stuff.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.681
Of course I'm in.

32:55.765 --> 33:00.477
While I don't share
his enthusiasm, you know me.

33:00.561 --> 33:03.063
Beam me up, Scotty.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.983
- You all right, Max?
- I-I don't... I-I don't...

33:08.736 --> 33:11.029
Whatever you think.

33:11.114 --> 33:14.491
- What about you?
- I'm in.

33:14.575 --> 33:16.493
All right, then.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.663
We go.

33:20.581 --> 33:24.001
I don't mean to be
the materialistic weasel of this group,

33:24.085 --> 33:26.253
but you think we'll get
hazard pay out of this?

33:26.337 --> 33:28.839
If you're trying to make me feel better
about this scenario, give it up.

33:28.923 --> 33:31.258
To tell you the truth, I'm kind
of encouraged. This guy Chick here

33:31.342 --> 33:32.968
was an Air Force commando
for six years.

33:33.052 --> 33:36.680
We got robbery, assault,
arrest, resisting arrest.

33:36.764 --> 33:38.348
We got a collection agent for the mob.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.017
Two of these guys
have done serious time.

33:40.101 --> 33:42.436
- Look, they're the best at what they do.
- So am I.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.438
And I'm not so optimistic.

33:44.522 --> 33:47.733
We spend $250 billion a year
on defense.

33:47.817 --> 33:50.360
And here we are. The fate
of the planet is in the hands

33:50.445 --> 33:52.946
of a bunch of retards
I wouldn't trust with a potato gun.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.869
So, what's the verdict?

33:58.953 --> 34:02.247
They'll do it. They've made
a few requests though.

34:02.331 --> 34:04.041
Such as?

34:06.169 --> 34:08.128
Just a few things here.

34:11.632 --> 34:16.053
Nothing really big.
Just... Well, as an example...

34:16.137 --> 34:19.181
Uh, Oscar here's got some
outstanding parking tickets.

34:19.264 --> 34:20.556
Wants 'em wiped off his record.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.309
Fifty-six tickets in seven states.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.728
- I'll tell him, Oscar. I got it.
- Okay.

34:24.812 --> 34:27.438
Uh, Noonan's got two women friends

34:27.523 --> 34:30.442
that he'd like to see made
American citizens, no questions asked.

34:30.525 --> 34:35.237
Max would like you
to bring back eight-track tapes.

34:35.322 --> 34:39.076
Not sure if that's gonna work,
but let's see what else.

34:39.159 --> 34:44.289
Chick wants a full week's
Emperor's Package at Caesar's Palace.

34:45.208 --> 34:49.127
Hey, you guys wouldn't be able to tell us
who actually killed Kennedy, would ya?

34:52.547 --> 34:56.051
Uh, Bear would like to stay at the...

34:56.844 --> 34:59.096
White Horse.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.765
White House. White House.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.683
White House. Yeah, he'd like to stay in

35:03.768 --> 35:05.268
the Lincoln Bedroom
of the White House

35:05.353 --> 35:06.770
for the summer.

35:06.854 --> 35:08.480
Stuff like that.

35:08.564 --> 35:13.193
Sure, I think we can
take care of some of that.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.237
Harry!

35:17.782 --> 35:19.699
Yeah, one more thing.

35:20.701 --> 35:24.037
None of them wanna pay taxes again.

35:25.873 --> 35:27.040
Ever.

35:34.048 --> 35:36.800
Who's that for? Mr. Ed?

35:36.884 --> 35:39.219
You stick that in me, I'm gonna
stab you in the heart with it.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.720
You ever see Pulp Fiction?

35:40.805 --> 35:45.892
Oh, say can you see

35:45.977 --> 35:47.018
Uh-oh.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.522
We're losin' him, we're losin' him.
Clear! Kaboom!

35:50.606 --> 35:53.650
- Freddy, you all right?
- Does this look okay to you?

35:53.734 --> 35:57.988
- Does this look okay?
- It's not all bad. It's kinda tingly.

35:58.072 --> 36:00.740
Mr. Chapple, you're next!

36:00.825 --> 36:03.451
Oh, gee, lady, I just came here to drill.

36:03.536 --> 36:05.912
Oh, so did I.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.917
Your triglycerides are way high,

36:11.002 --> 36:13.879
and your bad cholesterol
is shockingly bad.

36:13.963 --> 36:17.090
Gotta lay off those pork rinds, Bear!

36:17.175 --> 36:19.926
Pork rinds this! Yeah!

36:24.932 --> 36:27.100
Well, at least they're in good spirits.

36:30.771 --> 36:34.524
Piece of cake.
Look, you wanna compare brain pans?

36:34.609 --> 36:37.402
I won the Westinghouse prize
when I was 12. Big deal.

36:37.486 --> 36:41.489
Published at 19. So what? I got
a double doctorate from M.I.T. at 22.

36:41.574 --> 36:45.327
Chemistry and geology. I taught
at Princeton for two-and-a-half years.

36:45.411 --> 36:47.037
You know, I think this might be

36:47.121 --> 36:49.331
the most uncomfortable room
I've ever been in in my life.

36:49.415 --> 36:52.584
Why do I do this? Because the
money's good, the scenery changes,

36:52.668 --> 36:54.920
and they let me use explosives, okay?

36:55.004 --> 36:57.756
Okay, you wanna be
all psychological with me, that's fine.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.425
I'll tell you one thing
that really drives me nuts

37:00.509 --> 37:03.887
is people who think Jethro Tull
is just a person in the band.

37:03.971 --> 37:06.264
Who is Jethro Tull?

37:06.349 --> 37:10.352
My favorite dish is haggis.
Heart, lungs, liver.

37:10.436 --> 37:13.813
You shove that all
in a sheep's stomach, then you boil it.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.273
That'll put some hair on your ass.

37:15.358 --> 37:18.693
I am not crazy. I'm just
a little emotional right now, okay?

37:18.778 --> 37:21.571
You're all throwin'
all this stuff at me, man. I mean...

37:21.656 --> 37:24.157
After this is over, could I, like,
get a hug from you or somethin'?

37:26.744 --> 37:28.578
Okay, Cyclops lady is startin' to bug me.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.746
Can you handle it?

37:29.830 --> 37:31.665
I mean, I can handle what I'm,
you know, gonna do.

37:31.749 --> 37:34.042
I can handle that, but I don't know
if I can handle this room.

37:34.126 --> 37:36.044
Woman with large breasts.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.756
Woman with medium breasts.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.758
Here's Harry givin' me a hard time.

37:41.842 --> 37:43.969
And this is Harry tellin' me
it's not good enough.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.388
And this is Harry tellin' me
I can't marry his daughter.

37:46.472 --> 37:47.681
Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

37:47.765 --> 37:48.932
Just let it out.

37:50.518 --> 37:53.103
I suffered a major head injury
when I was in high school.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.523
This one looks like you, with breasts.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.775
Yeah, I can handle it.
Yeah, I can handle it.

38:00.027 --> 38:05.073
A home run!
The Cubs win the World Series! Ah...

38:06.033 --> 38:09.286
Fail. Fail. Depressively fail.

38:09.370 --> 38:12.622
One toxicology analysis
revealed catamen.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.791
That is a very powerful sedative.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.668
Sedatives are used all the time, Doctor.

38:16.752 --> 38:18.712
This one's used on horses.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.007
Some of these guys are pretty big.

38:22.091 --> 38:24.968
It would normally take 18 months
to psychologically prepare,

38:25.052 --> 38:27.387
prescreen viable subjects
for space travel.

38:27.471 --> 38:30.598
We have seen evidence of a wide
variety of territorial aggression.

38:30.683 --> 38:34.561
Can they physically survive the trip?
That's all I need to know here, okay?

38:34.979 --> 38:37.731
Personally, I don't know
how they survived the tests.

38:42.903 --> 38:44.738
Talk about the wrong stuff.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.077
Good morning. I'm Colonel Willie Sharp.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.997
In addition to flying
one of the X-71 teams to that rock,

38:54.081 --> 38:55.498
my job is to train you to deal with

38:55.583 --> 38:58.626
the mental and physical rigors
of working in space,

38:58.711 --> 39:01.963
so you don't freak out on the asteroid.

39:02.048 --> 39:05.383
United States astronauts train for years.

39:05.468 --> 39:07.469
You have 12 days.

39:07.553 --> 39:10.430
Do we have any intelligent
questions before we get started?

39:11.807 --> 39:13.224
What's an X-71?

39:13.559 --> 39:16.478
You're the first civilians to ever see her.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.439
We call 'em the X-71 s.

39:19.523 --> 39:22.150
It's a top secret joint venture
with the Air Force.

39:22.234 --> 39:25.653
She and her sister ship in Vandenberg
are leaving for launch prep in Florida.

39:25.738 --> 39:26.988
Thought you oughta take a look.

39:27.073 --> 39:30.033
The two shuttles going up are
the Freedom and Independence.

39:30.117 --> 39:33.578
Her titanium alloy impenetrable
skin covers the toughest, meanest,

39:33.662 --> 39:36.581
most sophisticated space vehicle
man has ever made.

39:36.665 --> 39:39.292
Okay, Air Force Colonel Davis,
NASA pilot Tucker

39:39.377 --> 39:41.419
will command the shuttle
Independence.

39:41.504 --> 39:45.173
Air Force Colonel Sharp,
NASA pilot Watts, shuttle Freedom.

39:45.257 --> 39:49.511
Munitions specialist Gruber and Halsey
will supervise the nuclear ordinance.

39:49.595 --> 39:52.639
Anyway, I just thought...

39:52.932 --> 39:54.933
Thought you guys should meet.

39:57.686 --> 40:01.481
Gentlemen, welcome to our weightless
environmental training facility.

40:09.031 --> 40:11.741
So we're going swimming on
this asteroid. Is that what this is for?

40:12.326 --> 40:15.745
Here at downtown NASA,
we call this monster "Armadillo. "

40:15.830 --> 40:17.622
Going to be retrofitted
with your drilling arm.

40:17.706 --> 40:20.417
She'll turn 800 turbo horses
in near-zero gravity.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.043
Mind if we take a look at her now?

40:22.128 --> 40:24.587
All these rubber hoses
gotta go, Max. Count 'em up.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.757
Make sure it's short-throw shifters.

40:27.842 --> 40:31.302
Quincy! Somebody tell me what this is.

40:31.387 --> 40:35.807
Plastic ice cream scoop?
What'd that cost? About $400.

40:35.891 --> 40:37.517
This is about
the sorriest group of people

40:37.601 --> 40:40.520
I've seen in all my entire military career.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.690
Your space flight's gonna be
a brutal assault on your senses.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.525
I'm here to give you a taste of that.

40:45.609 --> 40:48.236
NASA's got some of
the finest pilots in the world.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.114
They're gonna be suckin' your eyes
into the back of your heads.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.160
Go easy on me, okay? It's my first time.

40:55.244 --> 40:58.163
I just wanna seriously say
I have a small fear of flying.

41:00.207 --> 41:01.749
I'm gonna twist ya.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.006
- I'm gonna flip ya.
- What's the matter with you?

41:09.675 --> 41:11.801
Frap your body till your bones hurt.

41:11.886 --> 41:15.013
When you squeal, I'm just
gonna go faster and harder.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.806
No, take me down!

41:19.977 --> 41:22.645
- How's the rest of the crew?
- Well, uh...

41:22.730 --> 41:25.064
Sorry about the rib chunks
all over your dashboard.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.736
Don't forget: We gotta X-ray all these...

41:29.820 --> 41:32.614
- If you had to say, who would you say?
- I don't know, Oscar.

41:32.698 --> 41:34.574
- Who do you think you are?
- Han Solo.

41:34.658 --> 41:36.826
No, if anybody's anybody, I'm Han.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.828
And you're... You're Chewbacca.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.831
Chewie? Have you
even seen Star Wars?

41:41.916 --> 41:44.417
All right, let's go.

41:49.340 --> 41:53.510
Neil Armstrong, 1969,
bouncing on the moon.

41:53.594 --> 41:56.721
He's bouncing up there because there's
less gravity up there than on Earth.

41:56.805 --> 42:00.350
This will be similar
to the asteroid, so watch it.

42:00.434 --> 42:03.061
Something gets launched off
that asteroid with enough force,

42:03.145 --> 42:05.563
it's gonna keep on going
right into outer space.

42:05.648 --> 42:09.442
What is the deal?
Is it just me, or is Watts really hot?

42:09.527 --> 42:11.194
Yeah.

42:11.278 --> 42:15.240
We have these new generation suits
with directional accelerant thrusters.

42:15.324 --> 42:17.325
- You won't bounce like Neil Armstrong.
- Yeah, think so?

42:17.409 --> 42:19.035
- Bear!
- Yes?

42:19.119 --> 42:22.205
- Do we have a problem?
- No.

42:22.289 --> 42:23.414
'Cause I'm trying to describe to you

42:23.499 --> 42:26.251
how these D.A.T. s
keep your ass on the ground.

42:26.335 --> 42:27.794
So that if I were to kick you in the balls...

42:27.878 --> 42:28.962
Ooh.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.296
...and you don't know how to work them,

42:30.381 --> 42:31.631
what happens to you?

42:31.715 --> 42:34.050
- I float away.
- Yeah.

42:34.134 --> 42:37.220
And when do we start training for that?

42:37.304 --> 42:39.472
Gentlemen, I'll give you 30 seconds
to put your helmets on.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.891
Then the oxygen will be sucked
out of this vacuum,

42:41.976 --> 42:44.769
and you will know what it's like
to be in space. Go!

42:46.021 --> 42:49.399
Depressurize in 30 seconds.

42:49.483 --> 42:51.818
Main valves have been activated.

43:10.337 --> 43:12.088
Okay, gentlemen,
so here's the flight plan.

43:12.172 --> 43:15.550
Now let's keep the laughter to
a minimum. I know this is not to scale.

43:15.634 --> 43:20.179
Both shuttles will take off
Tuesday at 6:30 p. m.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.432
Now 67 minutes later,

43:22.516 --> 43:24.767
you're gonna dock with
the Russian space station

43:24.852 --> 43:26.728
to meet cosmonaut Andropov,

43:26.812 --> 43:29.772
who will refuel the shuttles
with liquid O2.

43:29.857 --> 43:32.609
That's your fuel. Then you'll release

43:32.693 --> 43:35.486
and take a 60-hour trip
toward the moon.

43:35.571 --> 43:39.407
Now we only have one shot
of landing on this rock,

43:39.491 --> 43:43.202
and that's precisely when
the asteroid passes by the moon.

43:43.287 --> 43:46.623
You'll then use lunar gravity
and burn your thrusters,

43:46.707 --> 43:49.626
slingshotting you around the moon,

43:49.710 --> 43:52.128
coming up behind the asteroid.

43:52.212 --> 43:55.465
- You'll be upward of 11 Gs.
- Yeah, I remember this one.

43:55.549 --> 43:58.801
It's where the coyote sat
his ass down in a slingshot

43:58.886 --> 44:01.095
and he strapped himself
to an Acme rocket.

44:01.180 --> 44:04.140
- Is... Is that what we're doin' here?
- Rockhound.

44:04.224 --> 44:07.060
No, no, really, because it didn't
work out too well for the coyote, Harry.

44:08.896 --> 44:11.606
Actually, we have a lot
better rockets than the coyote.

44:13.442 --> 44:17.737
Now when you've finished
your Road Runner thrust move,

44:17.821 --> 44:21.449
you'll be moving at
22,500 miles per hour.

44:21.533 --> 44:23.826
Coming around behind the asteroid,

44:23.911 --> 44:26.996
where we're hoping that the tail debris
will be cleared by the moon's gravity.

44:27.081 --> 44:29.248
And you'll land right here. That's it.

44:29.333 --> 44:31.542
We got separate landing sites
for each team.

44:31.627 --> 44:33.795
Softest parts of the rock
as we can figure.

44:33.879 --> 44:37.382
At NASA, we don't take chances.
We double up on everything.

44:37.466 --> 44:40.343
First team that hits 800 feet wins.

44:40.427 --> 44:44.222
Now this rock is big, dense. It's got
some gravity. You can walk around,

44:44.306 --> 44:47.100
but use your thrusters
so you can work easier.

44:47.184 --> 44:51.145
Okay, Mr. Truman, let's say
that we actually do land on this.

44:51.230 --> 44:53.356
What's it gonna be like up there?

44:53.440 --> 44:56.859
Two hundred degrees in the sunlight.
Minus 200 in the shade.

44:56.944 --> 45:01.531
Canyons of razor-sharp rock.
Unpredictable gravitational conditions.

45:01.615 --> 45:04.867
Unexpected eruptions. Things like that.

45:04.952 --> 45:08.204
Okay, so the scariest
environment imaginable. Thanks.

45:08.288 --> 45:10.331
That's all you gotta say,
scariest environment imaginable.

45:10.416 --> 45:14.335
Okay, so you drill,
you drop the nuke and you leave.

45:14.420 --> 45:16.045
Now here's the key.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.756
You're gonna remote detonate the bomb

45:18.841 --> 45:23.261
before the asteroid passes
this plane, zero barrier.

45:23.971 --> 45:27.098
You do that,
and the remaining pieces of rock

45:27.182 --> 45:30.435
should be deflected enough
to pass right by us.

45:30.519 --> 45:33.104
Now if the bomb explodes
after zero barrier,

45:37.317 --> 45:38.317
game's over.

45:38.402 --> 45:39.736
Apollo, this is Houston,
fire your rockets!

45:41.989 --> 45:43.698
Okay, your rockets are maximum.

45:43.782 --> 45:47.744
- Oscar!
- Hey, Harry. Hey, how's it goin'?

45:47.828 --> 45:50.663
- Have you seen Grace?
- Yeah, she's over in the hangar with A.J.

45:50.748 --> 45:54.542
Harry, wait a second. Did you say
Grace? Okay, I thought you said Bear.

46:31.663 --> 46:33.581
Will you marry me?

46:47.387 --> 46:49.222
Grace is old enough to vote, Harry.

46:49.306 --> 46:52.308
She's old enough to drink or get married
if she wants to, get a divorce.

46:52.392 --> 46:53.518
Let me tell you something, fellas.

46:53.602 --> 46:55.645
When I get back,
when we get this job done,

46:55.729 --> 46:57.313
I will deal with this in my own way.

46:57.397 --> 46:59.649
Come on, Harry. It's not like
I'm rootin' for A.J. here.

46:59.733 --> 47:01.567
I'm just sayin',
Grace is not a little girl anymore.

47:01.652 --> 47:03.528
Hey, Rock. Wait a minute. Let me get
a pencil and a piece of paper.

47:03.612 --> 47:05.822
I wanna jot down
all your pearls of wisdom here.

47:05.906 --> 47:09.325
Get serious, Harry. Come on. While
we're off trottin' the globe, hunting mud,

47:09.409 --> 47:11.994
Gracie grew up to become
a full-blown hottie, you know?

47:12.079 --> 47:14.747
- Harry, she is fully hot. She is...
- She's a babe.

47:14.832 --> 47:18.543
Max, okay, you're talkin'
about my little girl, all right?

47:18.627 --> 47:20.920
I think I know
who and what she is, okay?

47:21.004 --> 47:22.255
Harry, all we're sayin' is,

47:22.339 --> 47:24.882
we're talkin' about a kid
who's comin' into her own right now.

47:24.967 --> 47:27.176
She's gettin' curious about her body,

47:27.261 --> 47:29.929
and she's exploring her sexuality.
You know what?

47:30.013 --> 47:32.014
- Oscar.
- That's a natural thing.

47:32.099 --> 47:35.518
You are about five minutes older than
Grace is. Why should I listen to you?

47:35.602 --> 47:38.396
I know what it feels like to have
your hormones pullin' you in just

47:38.480 --> 47:40.231
a thousand different directions.

47:40.315 --> 47:43.526
No disrespect, man,
but we all helped to raise her.

47:43.610 --> 47:45.361
So, in part, we all feel like

47:45.445 --> 47:48.030
- a bunch of daddies here.
- That's true.

47:48.115 --> 47:53.035
I'll be damned if I worked all these years
so my little girl can marry a roughneck.

47:55.247 --> 47:57.874
She's better than that.

47:57.958 --> 47:59.667
Better than all of us.

48:07.801 --> 48:11.387
Harry, just sit back, relax. I'm gonna
put on a free Armadillo driving clinic.

48:11.471 --> 48:13.890
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Harry!

48:20.439 --> 48:21.731
Two shuttle teams.

48:21.815 --> 48:23.232
A.J.'ll be running the drill team

48:23.317 --> 48:25.693
with Oscar, Bear and Noonan
on the Independence.

48:25.777 --> 48:29.322
I'll run the drill team on Freedom
with Chick, Rockhound and Max.

48:29.406 --> 48:32.074
Once we land, we'll have
eight hours to get the job done.

48:32.159 --> 48:34.076
In order to split this rock
on the fault line,

48:34.161 --> 48:36.537
we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.

48:36.622 --> 48:40.374
Let's get our game faces on.
Now it's time for underwater simulation.

48:41.627 --> 48:44.962
Come on. Let's keep it up.
Let's go. We're the younger team here.

48:45.047 --> 48:48.424
We're the varsity team.
Take it to 11,000.

48:48.508 --> 48:50.968
Okay, gentlemen, we're gonna trick
'em up. My computer will simulate

48:51.053 --> 48:55.973
a gas pocket at 625 feet
and then hard iron ferrite at 635.

48:56.058 --> 48:59.685
I'm gonna drill some more.
We're takin' her up.

48:59.770 --> 49:02.605
- I'm givin' it more torque right now.
- All right, lookin' good, Bear.

49:02.689 --> 49:05.232
Clamp it down.
Watch your time, Independence team.

49:05.317 --> 49:07.276
Thanks, Harry. Would you mind
lettin' me run my own team?

49:07.361 --> 49:08.903
You're gonna blow the tranny.

49:08.987 --> 49:10.529
- Slow it down, baby.
- Take it easy, Bear.

49:10.614 --> 49:12.198
Just relax. She can handle it.

49:12.282 --> 49:14.158
A.J., you're at 600 feet.

49:14.242 --> 49:17.411
Your pipe is long. Let's back
the R.P.M. s down to 8,000.

49:17.496 --> 49:20.289
- We don't have time for 8,000!
- A.J., take it back down.

49:20.374 --> 49:22.667
You're gonna snap the pipe.
I don't wanna blow this transmission.

49:22.751 --> 49:24.961
- Damn it, 11,000.
- Slow it down, A.J.

49:25.045 --> 49:28.089
Bear, come on. Get on
our team for a little bit.

49:28.173 --> 49:29.465
Oh, space cowboy.

49:29.549 --> 49:31.968
- Harry, are you listenin' to this?
- Yeah, I'm listenin', Bear.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.011
You don't work for Harry
anymore, okay?

49:34.096 --> 49:35.137
Out there, you gotta listen to me.

49:35.222 --> 49:38.474
When we're on that rock,
you gotta do what I say.

49:38.558 --> 49:40.518
I'm throttling up to 11,000.

49:40.602 --> 49:43.270
A.J., back it off.
You're gonna blow the transmission.

49:43.355 --> 49:45.606
Hey, Harry, would you let me
run my team, please?

49:45.691 --> 49:46.899
R.P.M. s are at red line.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.484
Bear, goddamn it,
I know what I'm doing.

49:48.568 --> 49:51.237
Come on. She can handle this.
She'll be fine. Trust me.

49:51.321 --> 49:54.615
- A.J., back down.
- The number one transmission is down.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.158
Oh, son of a...

49:56.243 --> 49:58.327
The computer's wrong,
and you know that.

49:58.412 --> 50:01.914
- We did the right thing.
- We're gonna restart the simulation.

50:01.999 --> 50:05.167
If you wanna replace a member
of the crew, now is the time.

50:05.252 --> 50:08.170
I'll take care of this.
Get him out of the tank, Chick.

50:12.134 --> 50:13.426
You wanna go home? Is that it?

50:13.510 --> 50:15.011
- You wanna be fired?
- No, I don't.

50:15.095 --> 50:16.178
My crew was doing the right thing.

50:16.263 --> 50:17.638
- Your crew?
- Yeah.

50:17.723 --> 50:20.099
Your crewjust blew
the transmission, A.J.!

50:20.183 --> 50:22.560
Listen, that NASA computer
is just playin' it safe.

50:22.644 --> 50:24.270
The machine you built,
the rig, could do it.

50:24.354 --> 50:26.647
Shut up. Just shut up! Shut your mouth!

50:26.732 --> 50:30.693
Those men in that room have zero
tolerance for showin' off, hot doggin',

50:30.777 --> 50:34.864
goin' by your gut instinct or
you tryin' to be a hero, you got that?

50:34.948 --> 50:36.782
- Say the words, A.J.!
- I got it!

50:37.200 --> 50:39.410
I want my men
to have tomorrow night off.

50:39.494 --> 50:40.494
What do you mean "off"?

50:40.579 --> 50:42.955
I mean, off. Out of here.
For at least ten hours.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.165
Then we'll go to Kennedy.

50:44.249 --> 50:46.125
Well, there's no possible way
we can do that, Harry.

50:46.209 --> 50:47.543
There's a potentially huge security risk.

50:47.627 --> 50:49.378
What if they talk? What if they get hurt?

50:49.463 --> 50:51.797
What if they're too burnt out
to do the right thing?

50:51.882 --> 50:54.300
What if they get up there,
and they forget what they're fighting for?

50:54.384 --> 50:57.053
You see what's goin' on.
These boys are ready to snap.

50:57.137 --> 50:59.346
They didn't ask to be here.
They got pulled off the street.

50:59.431 --> 51:01.057
For all we know, tomorrow night
could be the last night

51:01.141 --> 51:02.183
they ever see Earth.

51:02.267 --> 51:04.226
I don't think it's too much to ask
to let 'em spend it with their families.

51:04.311 --> 51:05.394
Listen, there's no possible
way we can do that.

51:05.479 --> 51:07.021
You got family, Colonel?

51:07.105 --> 51:08.105
Two girls.

51:08.190 --> 51:11.484
Wouldn't you like to spend tomorrow
with your girls?

51:12.027 --> 51:14.612
I'm not askin' ya. I'm tellin' ya.

51:14.946 --> 51:16.572
Make this happen.

51:25.665 --> 51:29.251
This is a pretty big loan.
Why don't you count the cash?

51:29.336 --> 51:30.920
Nah, this looks like 100 grand to me.

51:31.004 --> 51:34.715
I'm givin' you this at 60 percent.
I hope you know what you're doin',

51:34.800 --> 51:36.926
because I'll bust your head
with a sledgehammer.

51:37.010 --> 51:38.594
You'll get your money back.

51:38.678 --> 51:42.306
You don't look too healthy.
You're not gonna die on me, are ya?

51:42.390 --> 51:46.393
Let's just say, no more than you are.
Thanks, Vic.

51:53.276 --> 51:57.113
Don't wanna close my eyes

51:57.197 --> 51:59.824
I don't wanna fall asleep

51:59.908 --> 52:02.118
'Cause I'd miss you, baby

52:02.202 --> 52:04.161
And I don't wanna miss a thing

52:04.246 --> 52:05.371
You know what I was thinkin'?

52:05.455 --> 52:06.705
What?

52:07.999 --> 52:11.710
I really don't think that the animal
cracker qualifies as a cracker.

52:11.795 --> 52:12.795
Why?

52:12.879 --> 52:14.630
Well, 'cause it's sweet,
which to me suggests cookie.

52:14.714 --> 52:16.507
And, you know,

52:16.591 --> 52:19.260
putting cheese on something
is sort of the defining characteristic

52:19.344 --> 52:21.720
of what makes a cracker a cracker.

52:21.805 --> 52:23.722
I don't know why I thought of that.
I just...

52:23.807 --> 52:26.058
Baby, you have such sweet pillow talk.

52:26.143 --> 52:27.935
I got a little animal cracker,

52:28.019 --> 52:30.563
Discovery Channel thing
happenin' right here.

52:30.647 --> 52:34.900
Watch the gazelle,
as he grazes through the open plains.

52:36.236 --> 52:40.114
Now look, as the cheetah approaches.

52:40.198 --> 52:42.658
Watch, as he stalks his prey.

52:43.410 --> 52:46.078
Now, the gazelle's a little spooked,

52:46.163 --> 52:50.499
and he could head north
to the ample sustenance

52:50.584 --> 52:53.669
provided by
the mountainous peaks above.

52:56.590 --> 52:58.299
He could go south.

53:00.010 --> 53:03.762
The gazelle now faces
man's most perilous question:

53:05.182 --> 53:06.515
North...

53:06.933 --> 53:09.018
Or south?

53:10.395 --> 53:14.106
Way down under.

53:17.652 --> 53:18.736
Tune in next week.

53:21.281 --> 53:22.698
Baby,

53:24.242 --> 53:27.786
do you think it's possible
that anyone else in the world

53:27.871 --> 53:31.373
is doing this very same thing
at this very same moment?

53:31.833 --> 53:33.209
I hope so.

53:34.127 --> 53:37.171
Otherwise, what the hell
are we tryin' to save?

53:42.177 --> 53:45.804
Don't wanna close my eyes

53:45.889 --> 53:48.390
I don't wanna fall asleep

53:48.475 --> 53:50.601
'Cause I'd miss you, baby

53:50.685 --> 53:53.812
And I don't wanna miss a thing

53:58.860 --> 54:00.027
Hey.

54:03.073 --> 54:04.740
What are you doing here?

54:04.824 --> 54:08.410
I was just passin' by on the, uh...
I came...

54:13.917 --> 54:15.292
Who's he?

54:15.835 --> 54:17.711
That man's a salesman.

54:18.505 --> 54:20.339
Would you go inside?

54:24.010 --> 54:25.469
Thank you.

54:28.181 --> 54:29.640
He got big.

54:32.727 --> 54:35.104
You can't come around like this.

54:35.814 --> 54:37.815
The court says you can't.

54:38.108 --> 54:39.358
It confuses him.

54:39.442 --> 54:41.360
No, I know. I just...

54:42.279 --> 54:43.988
I wanted to say

54:44.531 --> 54:46.198
that I'm sorry

54:46.992 --> 54:48.742
about everything.

54:50.829 --> 54:54.206
I got somethin' comin' up.
It's somethin' kinda big.

54:55.792 --> 54:58.127
You just might be proud of me.

54:58.211 --> 55:01.005
Would you do somethin' for me?
Would you just give him this?

55:01.089 --> 55:05.009
You don't have to... You don't
have to tell him who it's from. Just...

55:13.101 --> 55:15.644
Everybody talkin' about
what it is, what it ain't

55:15.729 --> 55:17.855
Kiss on the devil
and you piss off a saint

55:17.939 --> 55:20.524
But it can't be love
if you don't have to crawl

55:20.608 --> 55:23.694
You say you only love him
but you got to have it all

55:25.739 --> 55:27.990
Hey, Noonan, you need ten grand?

55:28.074 --> 55:29.658
We gotta put these girls
through college.

55:29.743 --> 55:31.994
I love this astronaut stuff.

55:32.078 --> 55:33.746
Good work, if you can get it.

55:33.830 --> 55:36.498
Yeah, I'm just in town
doin' a little astronaut training.

55:36.583 --> 55:39.251
Ooh! Astronauta.

55:39.336 --> 55:41.795
Ah, si. I'm a mission specialist.

55:41.921 --> 55:44.256
Yes, and what's that mean?

55:44.549 --> 55:46.050
I don't know.

55:47.886 --> 55:51.472
Hey! Who the hell
do you think you guys are?

55:51.556 --> 55:52.848
You're hoggin' all the action.

55:52.932 --> 55:56.185
Hey, pinhead.
Why don't you go find your own party?

55:56.269 --> 55:57.686
Why don't you spread the wealth, pal?

55:57.771 --> 55:59.438
Here. Why don't
you go buy yourself a neck?

55:59.522 --> 56:01.065
Hey, Mr. Clean!

56:05.987 --> 56:07.863
Call NASA! They'll confirm it!
We're astronauts!

56:07.947 --> 56:09.073
Get over there. Yeah, yeah.

56:09.157 --> 56:11.283
- Yeah, we're astronauts!
- Yeah, we're all astronauts.

56:11.368 --> 56:14.411
You are so messing
with national security right now, man.

56:14.496 --> 56:16.914
You are fired tomorrow morning.
I'm telling ya.

56:16.998 --> 56:19.041
I'll get the C.I.A. and the F.B.I.

56:19.125 --> 56:20.959
You'll be workin' security at Toys 'R' Us.

56:21.044 --> 56:23.045
- Oh, oh, baby, no, no. No, no!
- Bye-bye, little astronaut.

56:23.129 --> 56:24.546
Oh, don't leave, baby. No, no, no.

56:24.631 --> 56:26.632
See, I'm goin' into space,
and I'm not comin' back.

56:31.304 --> 56:33.138
It's coming in at 30,000 miles an hour!

56:33.223 --> 56:35.182
Give me a projected impact.

56:35.266 --> 56:36.725
East Asia, 11 minutes.

56:36.810 --> 56:40.145
- We're gonna have to warn...
- Warn who? The entire South Pacific?

57:33.741 --> 57:35.784
So the whole world knows.

57:37.954 --> 57:40.873
Tell me you've never let
anybody down before.

57:41.374 --> 57:43.750
I never quit yet. How's that?

57:44.419 --> 57:46.545
I guess that'll have to do.

57:47.839 --> 57:49.548
You know somethin'?

57:50.341 --> 57:52.926
I still remember the first,
middle and last name

57:53.011 --> 57:55.304
of every guy that qualified
for the astronaut program

57:55.388 --> 57:57.598
first year I was here. Thanks.

57:58.016 --> 58:00.559
I went into the engineering program.

58:00.894 --> 58:02.311
Kinda had to.

58:02.562 --> 58:04.563
But boy, I wanted to go up there.

58:04.647 --> 58:08.650
I wanted to be one of those guys
with a mission patch on my arm.

58:09.944 --> 58:12.279
I tell you, I'd be on that shuttle
with you, Harry, if I could.

58:17.076 --> 58:20.746
You don't want to be up
in that shuttle any more than I do.

58:21.915 --> 58:23.749
Good luck in Florida tomorrow.

58:23.875 --> 58:25.626
The death of 50,000 people

58:25.710 --> 58:28.003
in Shanghai yesterday has rattled...

58:28.087 --> 58:29.338
A French satellite has tracked

58:29.422 --> 58:31.298
an object in space...

58:31.382 --> 58:32.508
Sources are estimating

58:32.592 --> 58:34.092
that the tidal wave was five...

58:34.177 --> 58:35.969
This is CNN, live in Florida.

58:36.054 --> 58:39.598
We have just learned that NASA
is on a full-scale military alert.

58:39.682 --> 58:42.226
They're calling this a global killer.

58:42.310 --> 58:43.310
The government has been

58:43.394 --> 58:44.394
very tight-lipped throughout this...

58:44.479 --> 58:45.562
The Pentagon is getting involved

58:45.647 --> 58:47.397
at this point with some kind of a project

58:47.482 --> 58:50.359
involving NASA
and perhaps a shuttle mission...

58:50.443 --> 58:52.736
Senior Pentagon officials
refused comment,

58:52.820 --> 58:54.112
adding fuel to the speculation

58:54.197 --> 58:57.199
that there could be
a very serious problem.

58:57.283 --> 58:59.034
We have a special team of astronauts

58:59.118 --> 59:01.078
that arrived in Florida this evening.

59:01.162 --> 59:03.413
NASA's in emergency
launch preparation

59:03.498 --> 59:05.541
in cooperation with Russian, Japanese

59:05.625 --> 59:06.708
and French space agencies

59:06.793 --> 59:10.128
on the most massive joint
space venture in history.

59:18.471 --> 59:19.638
Gracie?

59:29.190 --> 59:30.691
Got your note.

59:32.026 --> 59:33.068
What're you doin' out here, honey?

59:33.152 --> 59:35.153
Um, just thinkin'.

59:36.406 --> 59:39.491
- Yeah.
- I, um, want to apologize to you for...

59:39.576 --> 59:42.744
Oh, no, Grace, stop.
You don't have to apologize at all.

59:42.829 --> 59:44.037
I... I...

59:46.124 --> 59:48.542
I shouldn't have dragged you
around on all those oil rigs.

59:48.626 --> 59:49.876
I just...

59:51.462 --> 59:53.630
I don't think that I did
the right thing with you.

59:53.715 --> 59:56.592
You're wrong. I love my life.

59:57.552 --> 59:59.803
I love everything about my life.

59:59.887 --> 01:00:02.848
And I don't blame you
for my mother leaving.

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:06.935
She left us both.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.355
And I love you.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.609
And don't talk
like you're not comin' back.

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:17.362
Promise me that you'll come back.

01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:19.823
Okay.

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:21.658
Say, "I promise. "

01:00:23.244 --> 01:00:25.037
I promise, Grace.

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:31.376
It's gonna be all right, Grace.

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:37.924
If it's not too much trouble,

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:40.385
can you please
bring my fiancée home with you?

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.220
Oh, Jesus.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:55.567
The president will be addressing
the nation and all of you personally

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:56.902
within the hour.

01:01:24.555 --> 01:01:26.098
Astronauts.

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:35.857
I'll see you in a couple days, honey.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.908
All my bags are packed

01:01:44.992 --> 01:01:46.785
I'm ready to go

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:49.913
I'm standin' here outside your door

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.543
I hate to wake you up

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.796
To say good-bye

01:01:58.172 --> 01:02:02.175
So kiss me and smile for me

01:02:02.593 --> 01:02:05.637
Let me know you'll wait for me

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:09.933
Hold me like you'll never let me go

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.478
'Cause I'm leavin'

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:16.022
On a jet plane

01:02:16.107 --> 01:02:18.984
Don't know when I'll be back again

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:23.321
Leavin' on a jet plane

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:26.700
I don't know when I'll be back again

01:02:26.784 --> 01:02:30.579
Leavin' on a jet plane

01:02:30.663 --> 01:02:33.915
I don't know when I'll be back again

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.208
Leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:39.337
So, Truman, this is who you found
to save the planet.

01:02:40.047 --> 01:02:41.757
- Frost, you good to go?
- Mm-hmm. One... One sec.

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:42.883
Leavin' on a jet plane

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:44.885
That boy don't take anything seriously.

01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:47.888
Yeah. Reminds me of a guy
I used to know.

01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:52.225
Leavin' on a jet plane

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:53.769
I don't know when I'll be back again

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:55.228
I'm marrying you.

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:56.313
Bet your ass you are.

01:02:56.397 --> 01:02:59.024
Leavin' on a jet plane

01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:01.985
I don't know when I'll be back again

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:19.586
I address you tonight,

01:03:20.421 --> 01:03:23.298
not as the President
of the United States,

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:27.135
not as the leader of a country,

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:29.805
but as a citizen of humanity.

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:36.061
WE are faced
with the very gravest of challenges.

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:42.776
The Bible calls this day
Armageddon, the end of all things.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:47.364
And yet, for the first time,

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:49.991
in the history of the planet,

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:53.161
a species has the technology

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.497
to prevent its own extinction.

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:59.793
All of you praying with us need to know

01:04:01.128 --> 01:04:05.423
that everything that can be done
to prevent this disaster

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:07.926
is being called into service.

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:13.807
The human thirst for excellence,

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:16.393
knowledge,

01:04:17.603 --> 01:04:20.605
every step up the ladder of science,

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:26.111
every adventurous reach into space,

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:30.198
all of our combined
modern technologies and imaginations,

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:34.202
even the wars that we've fought,
have provided us the tools...

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:36.454
to wage this terrible battle.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.666
Through all the chaos
that is our history,

01:04:40.835 --> 01:04:43.712
through all of the wrongs
and the discord,

01:04:43.796 --> 01:04:45.755
through all of the pain and suffering,

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.883
through all of our times,

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:50.218
there is one thing
that has nourished our souls...

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.888
Mom, that salesman's on TV.

01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:56.099
...and elevated our species
above its origins,

01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:58.184
and that is our courage.

01:04:58.811 --> 01:05:01.897
Dreams of an entire planet
are focused tonight

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:04.649
on those 14 brave souls

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:07.527
traveling into the heavens.

01:05:07.778 --> 01:05:09.905
That man's not a salesman.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:11.239
That's your daddy.

01:05:11.324 --> 01:05:12.407
And may we all,

01:05:12.491 --> 01:05:15.994
citizens the world over,
see these events through.

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:20.373
Godspeed and good luck to you.

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:30.216
Freedom crew. Independence crew.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.932
How ya feelin'?

01:05:37.016 --> 01:05:40.518
Uh, good, you know.
I mean, considering I've never been

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:43.438
this scared in my entire life.
I... You know...

01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:47.192
Listen. Once you get up there,
you're gonna be on your own.

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:48.818
If anything should happen,
I just wanted to...

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:52.530
I know, Harry.
I'll, uh, try not to disappoint you.

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:58.870
Take care of yourself, kid.

01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:06.044
Freedom's on the bridge.

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:09.881
Attention in the firing room.
Oxidizer loading is complete.

01:06:11.175 --> 01:06:12.634
Independence on the bridge.

01:06:12.718 --> 01:06:14.511
Attention all personnel.

01:06:14.595 --> 01:06:17.555
We are T minus two hours
to the program goal.

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:28.525
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah, Rock?

01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:31.903
You know, we're sittin' on four million
pounds of fuel, one nuclear weapon

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.990
and a thing that has
270,000 moving parts

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:36.658
built by the lowest bidder.

01:06:37.785 --> 01:06:40.286
Makes you feel good, doesn't it?

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:41.496
Yeah.

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:46.084
- How ya doin', Oscar?
- Great.

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:48.920
I got that excited, scared feelin',

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:51.881
like 98 percent excited,
2 percent scared.

01:06:52.299 --> 01:06:54.009
Maybe more. It could be 2...

01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:56.052
It could be 98 percent scared,
2 percent excited.

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:59.806
But that's what makes it so intense,
is it's so confused.

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:01.850
I can't really figure it out.

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:04.519
Will you make mine really tight,
'cause I don't want to fall out?

01:07:04.603 --> 01:07:07.105
I mean, almost to the point
of cutting off circulation.

01:07:10.776 --> 01:07:13.111
It must be a comfort to know
that if the space program goes under,

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:15.113
you can always get a job
at Helga's House of Pain, huh?

01:07:15.489 --> 01:07:18.033
All right. Flight directors
on with the go/no-go for launch.

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:19.325
- Retro.
- Go flight.

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:20.702
- Booster.
- Go flight.

01:07:20.786 --> 01:07:21.745
- Ecos.
- Go flight.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:23.204
- Trajectory.
- Go flight.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:24.622
- FIDO.
- Go flight.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:25.790
- EVA.
- Go flight.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.375
- CAPCOM Freedom.
- Go flight.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.794
- CAPCOM Independence.
- Go flight.

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:33.006
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's pucker time.

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:35.550
Independence and Freedom,
this is Kennedy firing room.

01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:37.302
We're T minus one minute.

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:40.305
All crew members,
close and lock your visors.

01:07:41.265 --> 01:07:45.101
Independence, this is launch control.
Be advised, we're in a smooth count.

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:48.396
T minus 31.
You're go for auto-sequence start.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:51.066
P.L.T.s, perform your A.P.U. pre-start.

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:54.194
Okay, gentlemen,
you're our warriors up there.

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:56.488
God be with you.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:59.240
You're already heroes.
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

01:08:00.826 --> 01:08:02.869
We're T minus 20 seconds.

01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:09.501
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.

01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:13.755
Four. Three. Two. One.

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:18.343
We have main engine start.

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:21.179
- We have booster ignition.
- We're going.

01:08:22.014 --> 01:08:23.430
And liftoff.

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:35.484
Freedom, this is flight deck.

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:40.240
Roger, Freedom. You're looking good.

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:53.670
We have go for Independence.

01:08:53.754 --> 01:08:56.214
Three. Two. One.

01:08:56.631 --> 01:08:58.383
Independence,
we have booster ignition.

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:01.261
We have liftoff.

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:02.970
We are cooking, Houston.

01:09:25.077 --> 01:09:27.537
Houston, the tower is clear.
They're all yours.

01:09:30.916 --> 01:09:32.500
Heads up, everybody. They're ours now.

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:33.835
All engines are go.

01:09:33.919 --> 01:09:35.920
Keep a sharp eye out on both of 'em.

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:45.596
Start roll maneuver.

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.066
Two good roll programs.

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:58.943
- One down.
- Independence, we have max cue.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.613
Roger, Control. We are a max cue.

01:10:03.115 --> 01:10:04.199
S.R.B. sep...

01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:11.497
We are single-engine, press, demi-go.

01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:13.208
Copy, press, demi-go.

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:15.668
Houston, this is a kick-ass ride!

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:24.385
Freedom, this is Houston.
Main engine cut out on schedule. Out.

01:10:34.271 --> 01:10:36.439
Freedom, stats are good.

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:42.904
Independence,
telemetry is up and running.

01:10:42.988 --> 01:10:44.113
Oh, my God.

01:10:44.198 --> 01:10:48.076
This is space! Course, we're just
in the beginning part of space.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.578
We... We haven't gotten
to outer space yet.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:52.872
Roger, Houston. We have a visual
on the Russian space station.

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:54.832
Initiating retro burn.

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:58.586
Gentlemen, remember
the Russian space station

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.296
has been up there for 11 years.

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:02.257
Most of us don't have cars that old.

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:03.299
Now, the cosmonaut on board

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:06.511
has been on that tin can
for 18 months, alone.

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:11.975
So don't be surprised if he's a little... off.

01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:13.351
Independence, we're gonna put you...

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.270
All right, crew.
Let's exit these flight suits.

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:18.940
Hello.

01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:22.568
This is Russian space station.
Can you hear me?

01:11:24.029 --> 01:11:25.947
We copy, Russian space station.
This is Houston.

01:11:26.031 --> 01:11:29.534
I'm ready to fire my thrusters any time.

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:33.037
- Stand by.
- Okay. I'm not going anywhere.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:35.790
We have a go.
Initiate gravitational spin.

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:45.425
You are maxed at 40-percent spin.

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:49.887
Okay, Houston.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:54.892
I can feel I'm having gravity.

01:11:55.602 --> 01:11:58.313
All right, gentlemen.
We're gonna dock in a minute.

01:11:58.397 --> 01:11:59.480
Now, the Russian space station

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:00.940
- has fired her rockets...
- Whee!

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:03.109
...to simulate gravity
and let us work faster.

01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:05.153
It's gonna make you queasy,
so prepare yourself.

01:12:05.237 --> 01:12:07.739
Well, it's about time.
I haven't thrown up in about an hour.

01:12:12.703 --> 01:12:15.788
Initiating first phase
of docking procedure.

01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:18.750
- Switching to manual.
- Manual override.

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:28.343
One foot per second. Let's take this
slow and do it right, folks.

01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:29.844
Twenty feet.

01:12:32.598 --> 01:12:33.765
Ten feet.

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:35.808
Looking good on radar.

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.394
Five feet.

01:12:42.274 --> 01:12:45.026
Locks are engaged. Fuel teams, let's go.

01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:48.988
Freedom, telemetry is looking good.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.991
We have soft dock.

01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:54.535
Fuel teams, prepare to unload.

01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:00.541
All right, gentlemen, watch your heads.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.543
Let's go, Independence.

01:13:06.006 --> 01:13:07.340
Colonel.

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:20.353
Where is he? Anybody home?

01:13:21.313 --> 01:13:23.272
Welcome, everybody!

01:13:25.692 --> 01:13:27.652
I am not gas station.

01:13:27.736 --> 01:13:31.030
This is sophisticated laboratory.
I'm in charge.

01:13:31.323 --> 01:13:33.741
So do not be touching anything.

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:36.744
- I need one... I need you.
- Go with him.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:39.455
I need you. Hurry up. Hurry up.
Come on. Come on.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.667
It's very important
you watch the fuel gauge, okay?

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:44.210
Put on cold suit.

01:13:44.294 --> 01:13:45.795
- Countdown clock will hold at...
- Copy that, Houston.

01:13:45.879 --> 01:13:47.130
Prepping for fuel transfer.

01:13:47.214 --> 01:13:49.507
Countdown clock will hold
at T minus 20 minutes and...

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:51.926
Fuel pod is down there.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:53.928
It's down here, huh? Great.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:07.567
Okay, let's connect these fuel lines.

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:12.697
Freedom on the left,
Independence on the right.

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:15.241
All right. We're goin' left here.

01:14:16.493 --> 01:14:19.954
To the right is fuel gauge.
You watch the fuel gauge.

01:14:20.038 --> 01:14:22.373
One fifty, okay. One sixty, okay.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:26.085
Two hundred,
bad disaster for space station.

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:32.091
So if you watch 200, you call for Lev,
on, and you see here number one. Off.

01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:34.802
You ask for Lev. And you pull
this down, all the way down.

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:36.179
What's Lev?

01:14:36.263 --> 01:14:39.640
I am Lev Andropov,
colonel of Russian space agency.

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.893
In Russia I'm a very big man.

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.812
We're ready to transfer.

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:46.772
I'm coming. No problem.

01:14:49.359 --> 01:14:51.903
You. You. You there!

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:55.364
- Hard locked.
- Ready for transfusion!

01:15:04.124 --> 01:15:06.042
Fuel is pumping.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:12.465
Hey, Lev, the, uh...
The... The pressure's climbing.

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.511
Still, we're on fuel transference.

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:19.180
Don't touch my uncle. You know?

01:15:19.264 --> 01:15:20.890
He's a genius of my family.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:25.895
Lev! Can anybody hear me?
Guys? Hello, guys!

01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:28.523
He used to work for a big bomb factory.

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:30.525
He used to make the tip of the bomb,

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:34.862
the thing that finds, uh, New York
or Washington, you know?

01:15:35.322 --> 01:15:36.489
Ooh.

01:15:36.573 --> 01:15:38.908
Check your hoses.
We got some thermal variation.

01:15:38.992 --> 01:15:41.911
Stamper, let's look at the couplings,
back on the shuttle.

01:15:43.997 --> 01:15:46.123
Okay. Shut down. Uh...

01:15:52.589 --> 01:15:54.882
Uh... Guys!

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:57.969
What's that noise?

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:01.305
Oh, no! God!

01:16:04.309 --> 01:16:05.851
What is it?

01:16:06.311 --> 01:16:08.854
Leak! Leak!

01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:13.317
Get your men back to the shuttle! Go!

01:16:14.611 --> 01:16:17.572
Go! Hurry up! Get out of there!

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:20.032
You know, this really smarts!

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:22.034
Pull lever!

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.786
This is the lever!

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:26.080
Colonel, we must get him out of there!

01:16:26.164 --> 01:16:28.499
A.J., come on out!

01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:33.212
Hurry! Hurry!

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:37.675
Emergency break away!

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.553
We got a fire in the fuel pod!

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:45.099
- Come on!
- Come on!

01:16:45.183 --> 01:16:47.852
Get in here! A.J.'s stuck in the fuel pod!

01:16:49.896 --> 01:16:50.980
We're losing it!

01:17:03.744 --> 01:17:07.204
Control, this is Independence.
I am seeing vibration...

01:17:08.915 --> 01:17:09.915
Malloy, talk to me!

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.959
Not good.
We got sparks and fire in the fuel pod.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:14.378
Independence, blow those locks
and get outta there now!

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:15.838
Dump the hoses now! We're going!

01:17:15.922 --> 01:17:18.215
What happened?
Let me shut off the O2 feed!

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.051
Harry, it's burnin' up!

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:22.637
Damn! Max, Rock, get in here!

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.930
Get down there
and crack these pipes over here!

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:26.390
Harry, it's burnin' up!

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:28.267
We're goin' back for the other team!

01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:32.063
Switch on
the personnel locators.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:34.440
Trackin' A.J. He's climbin'.

01:17:34.524 --> 01:17:36.400
- No!
- Go! Go!

01:17:36.943 --> 01:17:40.905
It's too late! Get back to the shuttle!
This thing's gonna blow!

01:17:41.406 --> 01:17:42.448
No!

01:17:43.241 --> 01:17:46.827
Colonel, we gotta move now!
Come on! Close the hatch!

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:50.122
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
We got a man in there!

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:53.167
- Open that door, and we'll all die!
- Fuel leak!

01:17:56.421 --> 01:17:58.839
Evac now! Let's go! Let's go!

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:04.595
Come on back! No, wait!
The door is broken!

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:07.098
No!

01:18:07.265 --> 01:18:08.849
They got the fire sealed in the fuel pod.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:09.892
They locked it down.

01:18:09.976 --> 01:18:11.060
Tracking men to the shuttle.

01:18:11.144 --> 01:18:12.812
They've still got
two men trapped in there!

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.650
Keep running!
The shuttle's another 75 feet!

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.110
Where's the rest of the team?

01:18:20.278 --> 01:18:21.362
Where's A.J.?

01:18:21.446 --> 01:18:23.739
- A.J.'s gone!
- We're not leavin' without A.J.!

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:26.033
He's gone! It's too late!

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:30.454
Come on! This way is our only chance!

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:32.748
So it's minus hundred!

01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:35.960
Very cold. Hold breath, or lung freezes!

01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:45.803
Get back to the shuttle!
And lock that door!

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:53.227
It's on fire! It's on fire, Harry!

01:18:53.311 --> 01:18:55.938
- It's them or all of us!
- It's on fire.

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:58.190
- Full thrust.
- We're gonna get hit.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:18.419
Lev! Lev, the door's gonna blow!

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:20.629
No!

01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:27.094
We're going! It's gonna blow!

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:29.638
A.J.'s still in there!

01:19:29.723 --> 01:19:32.224
Blow the locks. No, the bolts!

01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:33.809
We've gotta...

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:36.061
I think we're almost there!

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:39.440
Flight, Independence does not have A.J.

01:19:39.524 --> 01:19:40.649
They're gonna close the door
without him.

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:42.234
Tracking.
They're 75 feet from the shuttle.

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:43.944
Just tell 'em to air lock the door and go!

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:45.362
Dog the hatch now!

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:46.447
Close it!

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:52.995
Ho...

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:58.709
Colonel! That thing's comin' right for...
We got to move!

01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:04.131
Hurry up! There's the shuttle door!

01:20:06.718 --> 01:20:09.512
Fire's coming at us! Close the door now!

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:15.976
Go! Go! Go!

01:20:24.277 --> 01:20:28.072
Freedom, the Independence crew
is on board and accounted for.

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:30.825
We're even heavy one cosmonaut.

01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:32.743
They got 90 percent of their fuel.

01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:34.995
Pretty intense, huh?

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:40.251
That's why I told you, "Touch nothing. "
But you're bunch of cowboys.

01:20:44.756 --> 01:20:47.383
So while the consciousness
of the planet is unified,

01:20:47.467 --> 01:20:48.759
focused on the NASA mission

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:51.095
taking place right now
in the vast ocean of space,

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:54.098
we're now in the final hours
of the mission,

01:20:54.182 --> 01:20:57.518
as the Freedom and Independence
prepare to slingshot around the moon.

01:21:06.236 --> 01:21:09.280
Morning, guys.
It's time to suit up, I guess.

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:11.448
Uh, we got a big day.

01:21:12.075 --> 01:21:13.993
Eighteen seconds to radio interrupt.

01:21:14.077 --> 01:21:15.703
Booster sequence confirmed.

01:21:15.787 --> 01:21:18.789
This is Houston.
Roger that, Freedom. We copy

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.833
Shuttles are ready
for the burn around the moon.

01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:23.460
Radio contact terminated. We're out.

01:21:24.754 --> 01:21:28.966
Nine and a half Gs for 11 minutes.
I'd start praying about right now.

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:35.890
So this is the part
where we're supposed to just

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:38.392
hold on real tight and, uh,
hope we don't die.

01:21:38.476 --> 01:21:40.477
Stand by for lunar roll.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:42.271
High inclination. Lunar orbit.

01:21:44.649 --> 01:21:47.776
You boys got those wills
filled out correctly?

01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:04.919
All right, men,
this is what we trained for.

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:06.253
Nowjust suck it up!

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:09.381
On the mark. Five. Four.

01:22:09.466 --> 01:22:11.842
Three. Two. One.

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:23.646
Is this supposed to be like this?

01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:25.147
Don't worry. This is normal.

01:22:25.231 --> 01:22:26.273
How would you know?

01:22:27.525 --> 01:22:29.360
- Fourteen thousand miles an hour.
- Four Gs.

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:31.445
- Ahh!
- How long does this last?

01:22:31.529 --> 01:22:32.571
Six Gs.

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:36.659
Fifteen thousand.

01:22:36.743 --> 01:22:38.744
- Really heavy, man!
- This isn't normal.

01:22:38.828 --> 01:22:40.120
What do you mean, "this isn't normal"?

01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:41.872
This is way worse!

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:43.707
Eight Gs. Hang tight!

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:47.795
We're not gonna make it!
Oh, we're gonna die!

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:50.589
Twelve minutes.
Flight, we still got nothin' here.

01:22:52.425 --> 01:22:54.760
This is too fast!

01:22:58.765 --> 01:22:59.765
Ten Gs!

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:16.573
We're maxed at 22,500!

01:23:26.626 --> 01:23:29.420
We have acquisition of signal
from Independence and Freedom.

01:23:30.588 --> 01:23:33.340
We're in, guys.
All right. Welcome back, team.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.176
We have visual of the target, Houston.

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:46.729
You see that?

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:52.526
Wow.

01:23:55.655 --> 01:23:57.156
Come in, Independence.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.451
Houston, you gotta see this
to believe it.

01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:03.746
Okay, team, let's take 'em in.

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:05.622
Okay, Quincy, how much tail debris
do we have?

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.875
Freedom, turn on FOD radar.

01:24:07.959 --> 01:24:09.043
FOD radar on.

01:24:11.671 --> 01:24:13.881
Everybody, hang on.
This could get a little rough.

01:24:13.965 --> 01:24:15.883
Engaging evasive radar.

01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:24.725
Hold on!

01:24:36.112 --> 01:24:37.988
Goddamn! We got debris!

01:24:39.991 --> 01:24:42.701
We're dumping auxiliary boosters.

01:24:55.715 --> 01:24:58.509
- Houston, do you read me?
- We got debris!

01:25:01.012 --> 01:25:03.555
We're goin' in! We're comin' in hot!

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:08.852
Independence, try to maintain
your present heading.

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:10.020
You've got a target L.Z.

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:12.314
There's too much debris!
We gotta peel off!

01:25:12.398 --> 01:25:13.690
Negative!

01:25:16.986 --> 01:25:18.320
We're hit!

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:21.990
Mayday, mayday!

01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:23.951
I've lost main thrusters.
Get 'em back up!

01:25:24.035 --> 01:25:26.370
Mayday, Houston, mayday!
We've lost R.C.S. thrusters!

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:28.163
Mayday, Freedom, mayday!

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:30.415
We are out of control!
We are going down!

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.751
Do you read me?
Freedom, we are going down!

01:25:46.182 --> 01:25:47.141
We're gonna hit!

01:25:57.694 --> 01:26:02.072
Everybody, go to your own life support!
Lock yourself in the cargo bay!

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:05.325
We are going down!

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:09.121
Houston! Houston, we are going down!
We have lost control!

01:26:09.205 --> 01:26:10.873
I can't get it on!

01:26:13.126 --> 01:26:14.626
Good luck, Freedom.

01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:16.712
Oh, my God, this is it.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:10.641
Sharp, what the hell is that?
Is that the Independence?

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:17.564
Houston, Independence
is a dead stick.

01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:19.900
They're not gonna make it.

01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:34.206
Houston,
Independence has gone down.

01:27:46.302 --> 01:27:48.637
When I touch this baby down,
full reverse thrust.

01:27:48.721 --> 01:27:50.722
- Fires on your right, Sharp!
- Reversing the thrusters!

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.851
Hang tight! Hang tight!

01:27:55.853 --> 01:27:59.231
Houston, we overshot our landing field.
We overshot our landing field.

01:27:59.315 --> 01:28:01.233
Oh, no!

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:22.838
God!

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:42.733
Initiate system light system check.
Make sure we can still get off this rock.

01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:45.277
Our electrical system is screwed.
I'm going to back-up.

01:28:45.361 --> 01:28:47.154
Fuel seals check. Engine seals check.

01:28:47.238 --> 01:28:50.073
- Oh, God. Oh!
- Pressure seals check.

01:28:53.411 --> 01:28:54.411
Anyone hurt?

01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:56.913
Where's...

01:28:58.458 --> 01:29:02.127
Where's the other shuttle?
What happened to the other shuttle?

01:29:02.211 --> 01:29:04.421
Independence is off the grid.

01:29:04.714 --> 01:29:05.714
"Off the grid"?

01:29:05.798 --> 01:29:09.009
What are you, a freakin' cyborg?
What does that mean?

01:29:09.093 --> 01:29:11.470
Hey, you saw it yourself, right?

01:29:11.804 --> 01:29:13.263
They're gone.

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:18.185
Come in, Freedom. This is
CAPCOM Houston. Freedom, come in.

01:29:18.269 --> 01:29:21.104
This is CAPCOM Houston.
Come in, Freedom.

01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:23.857
- God!
- Let's just ask God

01:29:23.941 --> 01:29:25.901
to take care of our friends.

01:29:27.737 --> 01:29:29.613
May they rest in peace.

01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:32.115
Amen.

01:29:40.249 --> 01:29:41.958
We got eight hours.

01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:46.088
Let's get this job done and go home.

01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:47.547
Nothin'.

01:29:47.632 --> 01:29:50.008
Come on, Watts, Sharp, somebody.

01:29:50.468 --> 01:29:52.469
This is CAPCOM Houston.

01:29:53.971 --> 01:29:57.766
Come in, Freedom. Freedom, come in.
This is CAPCOM Houston.

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:01.812
Maybe you shouldn't be here.

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:04.231
I don't have anywhere else to go.

01:30:04.315 --> 01:30:06.149
Freedom, come in.
This is CAPCOM Houston.

01:30:08.319 --> 01:30:11.029
All right, let's get the tools unpacked
and fire up the Armadillo.

01:30:11.114 --> 01:30:13.323
We're not getting a damn thing
on the inertial nav system.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:15.909
- I know where we are.
- Please step away.

01:30:15.993 --> 01:30:17.327
Radio signal's dead.

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:19.079
I'm flipping the backup generator.

01:30:19.163 --> 01:30:21.665
Radio signal's gonna be cut in half
till we get main power back.

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:27.254
We're in segment 202, lateral grid 9,
site 15H-32, give or take a few yards.

01:30:27.338 --> 01:30:30.924
Captain America here
blew the landing by 26 miles.

01:30:31.008 --> 01:30:33.260
How the hell do you know that?

01:30:33.344 --> 01:30:35.095
Because I'm a genius.

01:30:35.179 --> 01:30:36.179
The gauges will not read.

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:38.640
They're all peaked, like we're plugged
into some magnetic field.

01:30:38.724 --> 01:30:40.517
Well, who on this spaceship
wants to know why?

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:43.061
- By all means.
- The reason we were shooting for grid 8

01:30:43.146 --> 01:30:47.816
is because thermographics indicated
that grid 9 was compressed iron ferrite.

01:30:48.985 --> 01:30:52.529
Which means that you landed us
on a goddamn iron plate.

01:30:55.199 --> 01:30:56.158
All right. Well, you heard the man.

01:30:56.242 --> 01:30:58.160
Let's wheel out the remote satellite link.
We need that radio.

01:30:58.244 --> 01:30:59.870
Oh, God, please tell me
we still got one of 'em.

01:31:02.999 --> 01:31:04.624
Independence has flat-lined.

01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:51.922
Oscar! Oscar!

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.092
Oh, God!

01:31:59.597 --> 01:32:03.099
Hello! Anyone! Is anyone else alive?

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:05.977
Somebody, help me!

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:09.189
A.J.!

01:32:10.691 --> 01:32:12.317
Where are you?

01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:13.735
I'm here.

01:32:18.324 --> 01:32:20.534
Lev, there's no one else.

01:32:21.494 --> 01:32:22.827
There's no one else.

01:32:22.912 --> 01:32:24.246
I know.

01:32:24.497 --> 01:32:26.206
Oh, man.

01:32:26.916 --> 01:32:29.834
Bear, where are you?
A.J.? A.J.?

01:32:31.671 --> 01:32:33.755
I'm in the shuttle, man.

01:32:34.924 --> 01:32:36.633
Are you all right?

01:32:36.968 --> 01:32:39.135
I'm so glad to see you, man.

01:32:39.428 --> 01:32:42.472
I never thought I'd be so happy
to see your ugly face.

01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:45.141
Houston, do you read? This is Freedom.

01:32:45.226 --> 01:32:46.518
Check your thrusters.

01:32:46.602 --> 01:32:48.311
Houston, do you copy?

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:49.980
Is everyone good to go?

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:02.158
Wow.

01:33:12.795 --> 01:33:15.213
Down here! In the valley!

01:33:16.173 --> 01:33:19.175
This place is like
Dr. Seuss's worst nightmare.

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:22.721
Let's get the remote satellite.
We'll get better reception up there.

01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:25.599
Bring Max down.

01:33:25.683 --> 01:33:29.060
Watch yourself through here, Max.
There're a couple big fissures.

01:33:29.145 --> 01:33:30.395
To the left!

01:33:30.479 --> 01:33:32.439
Bring it to the left!

01:33:37.695 --> 01:33:39.029
Rockhound,
you come on down here

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:41.698
and take some readings
down in the flat spot.

01:33:44.076 --> 01:33:45.619
Iron ferrite.

01:33:48.748 --> 01:33:50.248
I have fire.

01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:53.126
Watts, I'm comin' back.
Stand by.

01:33:53.210 --> 01:33:55.086
Mostly iron, Rockhound.

01:33:55.546 --> 01:33:57.255
God, I hate knowing everything.

01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:00.050
We couldn't have picked
a worse spot to drill.

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:04.220
Well, I can pretty much guarantee
it's not gonna be thicker than 50 feet.

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:07.432
- How do you figure that?
- 'Cause if it is, we're screwed.

01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:12.145
- Max, you good?
- Yeah. Just makin' hole.

01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:13.605
Turn it around.

01:34:13.689 --> 01:34:15.774
Friggin' outer space.

01:34:18.235 --> 01:34:19.611
It's good.

01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:30.288
All right. We're in. Another light.
We're cuttin' through pretty good.

01:34:30.373 --> 01:34:33.458
There's some stuff in here
I ain't never seen.

01:34:33.793 --> 01:34:35.710
All right, let's punch it down!

01:34:37.463 --> 01:34:40.173
- Hey, Harry, did you see that?
- Yeah, Max, I see it. I see it. What is it?

01:34:40.257 --> 01:34:41.508
We lost the bite in the bit.

01:34:41.592 --> 01:34:43.843
All right. Back it off. Back it off.

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:45.303
Goddamn it!

01:34:45.388 --> 01:34:47.555
Sounds like we twisted a shank.
Back it out of there, Max.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.766
Good. Good. Hold 'er there.

01:34:54.063 --> 01:34:57.023
Wow, this is a goddamn Greek tragedy.

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:59.526
We've all seen
broken drill heads before.

01:34:59.610 --> 01:35:01.361
Not after ten feet.

01:35:01.445 --> 01:35:04.197
- I never seen one.
- Well, now you've seen one.

01:35:04.281 --> 01:35:06.783
- What do you want?
- Unpack the Judge.

01:35:09.286 --> 01:35:10.912
Bear, Lev.

01:35:11.789 --> 01:35:14.916
We're only
three astronauts left now.

01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:17.210
We're not astronauts.
We're oil drillers.

01:35:17.294 --> 01:35:19.295
We're not even supposed to be here.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.464
What? You're not astronaut?

01:35:22.007 --> 01:35:24.801
- I'm getting us outta here. Get in.
- Why?

01:35:24.885 --> 01:35:27.262
Just get in the Armadillo. I have an idea.

01:35:27.346 --> 01:35:29.431
Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?

01:35:29.515 --> 01:35:32.058
Houston, do you copy?
Freedom shuttle has...

01:35:33.853 --> 01:35:36.521
We're gettin'
some scattered video feeds here.

01:35:36.605 --> 01:35:38.732
Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?

01:35:38.816 --> 01:35:41.401
- Thank God we have you, Freedom.
- Freedom, this is Houston. Go ahead.

01:35:41.485 --> 01:35:43.987
- Don't lose 'em, Malloy.
- Sharp, I'm getting something.

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:45.071
Houston, this is Freedom.

01:35:45.156 --> 01:35:46.948
- We have landed safely.
- Where are they?

01:35:47.032 --> 01:35:49.743
We are at site coordinates
approximately 15H-32...

01:35:49.827 --> 01:35:51.578
Okay, I want to know everything
we can about that location.

01:35:51.662 --> 01:35:52.829
- Got it.
- Get it before we lose 'em.

01:35:52.913 --> 01:35:55.081
We're also having electric
and antenna difficulties.

01:35:55.166 --> 01:35:56.416
Walter, get Mechanical on that.

01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:58.460
But we have commenced drilling.

01:35:58.544 --> 01:36:00.462
Stevens, we're losin' him.
Bring it up on four. On four.

01:36:00.546 --> 01:36:03.840
- Come on.
- Shuttle flight capability not yet known.

01:36:04.216 --> 01:36:05.216
- Bump the signal.
- Bumping.

01:36:05.301 --> 01:36:06.593
Houston. Houston.

01:36:06.677 --> 01:36:09.220
We lost 'em. Get 'em back.
Gruber, we need that hookup.

01:36:11.766 --> 01:36:13.975
Show you how we do things
where I come from.

01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:23.526
Hold on!

01:36:33.329 --> 01:36:34.704
Seat it.

01:36:35.372 --> 01:36:38.082
All right, get ready. Max, thread it.

01:36:39.543 --> 01:36:42.670
Guys, the clock is tickin'.
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

01:36:42.755 --> 01:36:44.839
All right! Good! Crank it loose!

01:36:44.924 --> 01:36:48.009
Keep it at 25.
Let's kick a little asteroid butt!

01:36:48.093 --> 01:36:50.303
All right, Chick. Give me more torque
on the turbine, huh?

01:36:51.722 --> 01:36:53.139
Max, I need some more power
down here!

01:36:53.224 --> 01:36:54.557
- All right, boss.
- Throw it in fourth,

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:55.809
then drop the hammer.

01:36:55.893 --> 01:36:57.477
Let's drill through this turd.

01:36:57.561 --> 01:36:59.979
Come on, boys.
We gotta hop. We're fallin' behind.

01:37:00.064 --> 01:37:02.982
Dig, dig, dig. Chew this iron bitch up.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:09.989
- Chick, the tranny's stuck.
- Harry!

01:37:10.074 --> 01:37:11.449
What is it?

01:37:12.076 --> 01:37:13.076
Chick, come on! Help!

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.828
- Release the clutch!
- Pull it up!

01:37:14.912 --> 01:37:17.455
Okay. Well, this thing's not movin'.

01:37:18.457 --> 01:37:21.084
No, no, no! Shut it down! Shut it...

01:37:28.384 --> 01:37:30.343
This is not workin' out, Harry.

01:37:30.427 --> 01:37:34.514
- Oh, are you all right?
- Oh, blew the tranny. Blew the tranny.

01:37:35.808 --> 01:37:37.267
Come on, God.

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:41.813
Just a little help. That's all I'm askin'.

01:37:42.481 --> 01:37:45.650
I think we're close enough.
He might've heard ya.

01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:50.864
Here's the bad news.
Before the asteroid passed the moon,

01:37:50.948 --> 01:37:54.200
her rotation was stable
at 32 degrees on an x axis.

01:37:54.285 --> 01:37:58.204
But now look at this.
The lunar gravity's put her in a spin.

01:37:58.539 --> 01:38:02.000
She's tumbling on all three axes.
This wasn't expected, sir.

01:38:02.084 --> 01:38:04.669
- What does this do for communications?
- Not good.

01:38:04.753 --> 01:38:07.422
We'll have definite contact with
the shuttle for only seven more minutes.

01:38:07.506 --> 01:38:10.300
- After that it's radio darkness.
- For how long?

01:38:10.384 --> 01:38:14.137
And after seven minutes,
we may never hear from them again.

01:38:14.597 --> 01:38:16.097
But we're trying to bounce a signal

01:38:16.181 --> 01:38:18.641
off a Russian military satellite,
reestablish contact that way.

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:20.560
If we lose the shuttle com,

01:38:20.644 --> 01:38:23.187
when do we lose the ability
to remote detonate that nuke?

01:38:23.272 --> 01:38:25.690
The weapon remote receives a signal
from a Milstar satellite.

01:38:25.774 --> 01:38:27.775
Higher orbit, more powerful transmitter.

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:29.777
If we've got the shuttle
for seven minutes,

01:38:29.862 --> 01:38:32.196
we can remote detonate
for an additional five.

01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:34.407
What he's trying to say, General,
is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time,

01:38:34.491 --> 01:38:38.119
you may lose the ability
to detonate the nuke... permanently.

01:38:38.203 --> 01:38:40.038
I've got to inform the president.

01:38:41.665 --> 01:38:44.250
Just want to make sure you know
we're stuck on an asteroid.

01:38:44.335 --> 01:38:46.252
- Do you know what you're doing now?
- No, no.

01:38:46.337 --> 01:38:49.631
You know what? I have no idea
what I'm doing. I have no idea.

01:38:49.715 --> 01:38:52.008
This button,
I don't know what that does, okay?

01:38:52.092 --> 01:38:54.636
All I know is
that we just crashed back there,

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:57.597
I lost two of my friends,
we're 25 miles from Harry's shuttle.

01:38:57.681 --> 01:39:00.099
We don't know if he's alive.
We don't know if he can fly.

01:39:00.184 --> 01:39:01.893
All I know is,
there's a beep on this thing

01:39:01.977 --> 01:39:03.102
and I'm trying to get us there.

01:39:11.862 --> 01:39:13.863
Let's get it unpacked.

01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.949
What's up?

01:39:16.033 --> 01:39:18.743
We're drilling through some
kind of metal I've never seen before.

01:39:18.827 --> 01:39:21.788
It's fried two of our drill bits,
and now we blew our first transmission.

01:39:21.872 --> 01:39:22.872
So how deep are we?

01:39:22.957 --> 01:39:24.666
We could use your help
with the transmission, Colonel.

01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:27.627
I have an assessment report due now.
We're supposed to be at 200 feet.

01:39:27.711 --> 01:39:30.463
- So how deep are we?
- Not as deep as we'll be

01:39:30.547 --> 01:39:32.048
when you quit askin' me
these questions

01:39:32.132 --> 01:39:33.716
and help us load this transmission on.

01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:35.051
What is our current depth?

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:36.928
Our current depth
is not important, Colonel.

01:39:37.012 --> 01:39:40.056
I'll decide what's important.
We've got 800 feet to drill.

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:43.142
You've had two and a half hours.
Where are we?

01:39:44.853 --> 01:39:46.437
We're at 57 feet.

01:39:47.064 --> 01:39:48.064
Now, if you're not too busy,

01:39:48.148 --> 01:39:50.441
maybe you can give us a hand
with this transmission.

01:39:50.526 --> 01:39:52.068
Colonel Sharp!

01:39:53.195 --> 01:39:55.905
Get this strapped up. I'll be right back.
Colonel Sharp!

01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:59.200
All right. I'm coming through.
We have contact. Over.

01:39:59.284 --> 01:40:01.869
That's as clear as it's gonna get.

01:40:02.621 --> 01:40:04.831
Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?

01:40:04.915 --> 01:40:07.500
Working at a remote satellite link
at this moment.

01:40:07.584 --> 01:40:08.835
- Transmission change.
- Colonel!

01:40:08.919 --> 01:40:11.587
Twenty minutes.
Puts drilling final at ten hours.

01:40:11.672 --> 01:40:15.174
Please advise. That's four hours
past the zero barrier. Please advise.

01:40:15.259 --> 01:40:18.052
What the hell is this? "Zero depth"?

01:40:18.262 --> 01:40:21.014
And where'd this come from?
Who are you talkin' to? Is that Truman?

01:40:21.098 --> 01:40:22.515
Lemme have that phone.
Gimme the phone.

01:40:22.599 --> 01:40:25.560
Truman! Look, this is what happens
when you drill.

01:40:25.644 --> 01:40:29.897
We cannot use your "U.S. Air Force
Personnel Only" drill time card.

01:40:29.982 --> 01:40:32.108
- Who wrote this thing, by the way?
- We're losing coms again.

01:40:32.192 --> 01:40:34.402
Look. Is he getting this?
Does he hear me or...

01:40:34.486 --> 01:40:35.820
- What's wrong with this?
- The com's down.

01:40:35.904 --> 01:40:36.863
What do you mean, "the com's down"?

01:40:36.947 --> 01:40:38.281
What do I mean?
I mean we've lost

01:40:38.365 --> 01:40:39.907
- communication to mission control.
- Fine.

01:40:39.992 --> 01:40:41.951
Let's go back to the cargo bay
and get the transmission...

01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:45.371
Harry, guess what. You had your shot.
You didn't do it. You understand me?

01:40:45.456 --> 01:40:47.206
- You can't...
- Why don't you stay here...

01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:52.003
Write a report, why don't ya?
That'll be...

01:40:53.797 --> 01:40:55.965
My men and I will go
and get this hole dug!

01:40:56.050 --> 01:41:00.053
You and your men are the biggest
mistake in the history of NASA.

01:41:02.431 --> 01:41:05.433
- We've lost communication.
- Oh, God.

01:41:07.978 --> 01:41:12.190
- We're not lookin' too good right now.
- No shit.

01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:14.942
We gotta get that radio back up.

01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:20.531
Mr. President,
it's time to make a decision.

01:41:20.616 --> 01:41:24.911
We can remote detonate the bomb
for only another five minutes.

01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:29.665
Yes? Kimsey here. Yes, Mr. President.

01:41:30.959 --> 01:41:33.002
Yes, we saw that, too, sir.

01:41:33.670 --> 01:41:36.339
But maybe we should wait until they...

01:41:42.763 --> 01:41:45.973
Dan, get them out of there.

01:41:46.809 --> 01:41:49.185
- Evac right now.
- What's goin' on here?

01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:51.104
I've been ordered
to override the system.

01:41:56.068 --> 01:41:58.027
Well, what is this?

01:42:02.491 --> 01:42:04.242
Secondary protocol.

01:42:10.499 --> 01:42:13.126
But they haven't drilled
the damn hole yet!

01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:19.549
The president's advisors feel
that the drilling isn't working.

01:42:19.633 --> 01:42:21.509
And we've lost radio contact,
maybe for good.

01:42:21.593 --> 01:42:22.635
We've only got a few minutes left of

01:42:22.719 --> 01:42:24.846
guaranteed ability to
remote detonate that nuke.

01:42:24.930 --> 01:42:27.431
If we don't do it now we could lose
control, and we may never get it back.

01:42:27.516 --> 01:42:30.726
Well, you tell the president that
he better fire his so-called advisors.

01:42:30.811 --> 01:42:32.311
If you detonate that nuke on the surface,

01:42:32.396 --> 01:42:34.105
we waste a perfectly good bomb,

01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:36.023
and we have one chance
to save this planet!

01:42:47.077 --> 01:42:48.619
I need that radio.

01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:51.330
Gruber, give me
everything you got now!

01:42:51.415 --> 01:42:52.456
Roger that.

01:42:55.794 --> 01:42:57.503
Yes, Mr. President,
I understand that completely,

01:42:57.588 --> 01:42:59.630
but my point is very, very simple.

01:42:59.715 --> 01:43:02.258
And I think you need to trust me on this
because I know something about it.

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:05.970
I guarantee you,
if you do this, you kill us all.

01:43:09.349 --> 01:43:10.766
Yes, sir.

01:43:11.268 --> 01:43:14.020
General, he wants you.

01:43:15.898 --> 01:43:18.149
This is Kimsey. Yes, sir.

01:43:19.276 --> 01:43:20.735
I understand.

01:43:23.655 --> 01:43:27.325
The orders are to remote detonate
in 30 seconds.

01:43:27.409 --> 01:43:32.538
You have not told them yet!
That is my father up there!

01:43:32.623 --> 01:43:35.958
This is one order you shouldn't follow,
and you fucking know it!

01:43:36.043 --> 01:43:38.002
Let her go. Let her go!

01:43:40.964 --> 01:43:42.465
Your key, sir.

01:43:47.596 --> 01:43:49.305
God be with them.

01:43:50.432 --> 01:43:52.058
Slow it down.

01:43:58.649 --> 01:43:59.941
Harry,

01:44:00.651 --> 01:44:04.111
the clock on that nine-foot
nuclear weapon is ticking.

01:44:05.656 --> 01:44:09.825
Oh, my God! Sharp! Get back here now!

01:44:10.494 --> 01:44:12.578
What?
Get the shuttle ready to evac now!

01:44:12.663 --> 01:44:13.913
It just came on all by itself.

01:44:13.997 --> 01:44:15.539
- What the hell's happening?
- Secondary protocol.

01:44:15.624 --> 01:44:17.541
- What's that? What?
- Secondary protocol.

01:44:17.626 --> 01:44:19.168
- What does that mean?
- What the hell's secondary protocol?

01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:20.461
They're detonating this thing from Earth.

01:44:20.545 --> 01:44:21.629
What do you mean, detonating?

01:44:21.713 --> 01:44:22.880
- We haven't even drilled the hole yet!
- We'll drop it in the hole.

01:44:22.965 --> 01:44:24.131
- What're you talkin' about?
- The hole?

01:44:24.216 --> 01:44:25.299
Get your helmets on now!

01:44:25.384 --> 01:44:28.386
- Oh, no, no. How... How you turn it off?
- I got two men out on that rock!

01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:30.721
I got a man out there, too.
We gotta evac now.

01:44:30.806 --> 01:44:32.765
Max, Rockhound,
get back to the shuttle, double-time!

01:44:32.849 --> 01:44:35.768
- They could be on their way here.
- They're not on their way here.

01:44:35.852 --> 01:44:38.604
They would've talked to us by now.
We would've seen them.

01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:41.899
- Watts, air lock the cockpit now!
- I copy you.

01:44:41.984 --> 01:44:43.818
- Max, Rockhound!
- Hey, wait a minute!

01:44:43.902 --> 01:44:45.278
How do you turn this thing off?

01:44:46.655 --> 01:44:48.698
- Harry, do you copy?
- Something's wrong.

01:44:48.782 --> 01:44:51.617
Yeah, it's all wrong, man.
We shouldn't even be up here.

01:44:51.702 --> 01:44:53.619
I know. Let's go back to the ship!

01:44:54.871 --> 01:44:56.580
I'm not leavin' without my men, Sharp.

01:44:56.665 --> 01:44:59.417
We've got two and a half minutes
to drop it and get off this rock.

01:44:59.501 --> 01:45:01.961
If they're not back by the time we finish,
we leave without 'em.

01:45:02.045 --> 01:45:04.463
Okay, let's simplify this.
Let's just turn the bomb off right now.

01:45:04.548 --> 01:45:07.508
If we don't put this bomb down
in a hole 800 feet onto a fault line,

01:45:07.592 --> 01:45:09.719
all you're gonna have is
a real expensive fireworks show.

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:12.263
This is turnin' into a
surrealistic nightmare here.

01:45:12.681 --> 01:45:14.974
Watsler, are you listening? It's Truman.

01:45:15.058 --> 01:45:18.894
Okay, listen to me carefully.
I want you to kill it. Kill the uplink.

01:45:30.407 --> 01:45:32.908
Give us the time, Sharp.
Shut this bomb down now!

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:34.577
- It's not my call.
- Then whose call is it?

01:45:34.661 --> 01:45:36.662
An order to detonate can
only come from the president.

01:45:36.747 --> 01:45:38.289
- The president's not here!
- Let's just turn it off now.

01:45:38.373 --> 01:45:39.498
You've gotta give us more time!

01:45:39.583 --> 01:45:40.833
I'm telling you to
shut this bomb down now!

01:45:40.917 --> 01:45:42.501
And I'm telling you it's not my call!

01:45:42.586 --> 01:45:44.503
Well, guess what.
I just made the call for you.

01:45:44.588 --> 01:45:45.796
Harry!

01:45:47.924 --> 01:45:51.010
Don't. You could set it off.

01:45:51.094 --> 01:45:54.680
Oh, man.
What're you doin' with a gun in space?

01:45:57.768 --> 01:46:01.145
Come on, come on.
We gotta stop that bomb right now.

01:46:01.229 --> 01:46:02.521
Kill the uplink.

01:46:02.898 --> 01:46:04.732
This thing is gonna blow.

01:46:04.816 --> 01:46:07.777
- We gotta get it off the ship.
- Easy.

01:46:07.861 --> 01:46:09.195
Stand down, Sergeant.

01:46:09.279 --> 01:46:13.199
Shut this bomb down
and let us finish our job the right way.

01:46:13.283 --> 01:46:15.910
I'm under orders to protect
a surface detonation.

01:46:15.994 --> 01:46:18.287
I'm gonna give you three seconds
to shut this bomb down,

01:46:18.372 --> 01:46:20.206
and then I'm gonna make you shoot me.

01:46:21.249 --> 01:46:23.584
Hurry, Watsler. For Christ's sake, hurry.

01:46:27.631 --> 01:46:29.507
What happened?

01:46:33.804 --> 01:46:37.348
Sir, the override... It's been overridden.

01:46:38.308 --> 01:46:39.392
I bought us a couple of minutes,

01:46:39.476 --> 01:46:41.519
so get that radio workin', okay?
Hurry, hurry!

01:46:44.147 --> 01:46:47.900
Bring me all the way up here just to
blow me and my friends up? Is that it?

01:46:47.984 --> 01:46:50.736
- Listen...
- Shut up!

01:46:50.821 --> 01:46:54.740
Shut up, Colonel. I'm talking now.

01:46:54.825 --> 01:46:56.826
It could start again.
It might've been a warning.

01:46:58.995 --> 01:46:59.954
Uh-oh.

01:47:00.038 --> 01:47:02.456
That's why you are gonna
dismantle this bomb.

01:47:02.541 --> 01:47:05.126
All right. What'd we miss?

01:47:09.631 --> 01:47:12.508
- Do it again.
- Go.

01:47:15.971 --> 01:47:17.888
Keep tryin'.

01:47:19.182 --> 01:47:23.769
Sir, I need you to cease and desist.
I need your terminal... Now.

01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:29.942
- They're reactivating the bomb.
- Comin' back on-line, sir.

01:47:30.026 --> 01:47:33.320
Oh, geez. Here we go again.

01:47:33.405 --> 01:47:36.449
What're you doin' up here? And why
did you even bother to make the trip?

01:47:36.533 --> 01:47:39.118
To do the right thing,
to see that it's done.

01:47:47.043 --> 01:47:50.087
For God's sakes,
think about what you're doin'.

01:47:50.172 --> 01:47:53.632
Why are you listenin' to someone
that's 100,000 miles away?

01:47:53.717 --> 01:47:57.303
We're here.
Nobody down there can help us.

01:47:57.387 --> 01:48:01.182
So if we don't get this job done,
then everybody's gone.

01:48:01.266 --> 01:48:02.808
One minute.

01:48:03.894 --> 01:48:06.604
I've been drillin' holes
in the earth for 30 years.

01:48:06.688 --> 01:48:11.442
And I have never, never missed
a depth that I have aimed for.

01:48:11.526 --> 01:48:14.987
And by God, I am not gonna miss
this one. I will make 800 feet.

01:48:15.071 --> 01:48:16.864
Forty-two seconds.

01:48:18.241 --> 01:48:21.160
But I can't do it alone, Colonel.
I need your help.

01:48:21.244 --> 01:48:24.747
You swear on your daughter's life,
on my family's,

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:27.500
that you can hit that mark?

01:48:27.584 --> 01:48:31.879
I will make 800 feet.
I swear to God, I will.

01:48:31.963 --> 01:48:34.423
Then let's turn this bomb off.

01:48:46.353 --> 01:48:47.937
Steady. Take it back.

01:48:48.021 --> 01:48:49.939
That's what you'll have to do.
Get 'em off backwards.

01:48:50.023 --> 01:48:51.524
Rainbow track? Under...

01:48:51.608 --> 01:48:53.150
- Under one? Under... Okay.
- All of 'em. All of 'em.

01:48:53.235 --> 01:48:56.695
- Okay. Are we free of static?
- Oh, do a good job. Do a good job.

01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:59.073
- Steady. Steady.
- Good job. All right. All right.

01:48:59.157 --> 01:49:02.868
Go! Go! Go! Red wire "A."
Ready? And...

01:49:02.953 --> 01:49:04.745
Now. Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

01:49:06.164 --> 01:49:07.248
Negative "B."

01:49:07.332 --> 01:49:10.209
- Ready, and now.
- Do a good job. Do a good job.

01:49:10.293 --> 01:49:11.710
Track flipped. Hot's in.

01:49:11.795 --> 01:49:13.128
- It better be. Go.
- Red or blue?

01:49:16.299 --> 01:49:17.550
Re...

01:49:22.764 --> 01:49:24.139
Blue.

01:49:27.185 --> 01:49:28.394
Good job!

01:49:33.733 --> 01:49:36.193
Oh, God, it sucks up here.

01:49:36.987 --> 01:49:39.697
Sir, the clock has stopped
at three seconds.

01:49:39.781 --> 01:49:41.031
What?

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.867
Have we lost complete radio contact?

01:49:43.952 --> 01:49:45.077
I got some magic happening.

01:49:45.161 --> 01:49:46.495
We're bouncing off Russian
and French satellites.

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:50.624
- It may have a faint signal.
- Houston? Houston, do you copy?

01:49:52.335 --> 01:49:54.336
Go ahead, Freedom.

01:49:54.671 --> 01:49:55.963
Houston, you have a problem...

01:49:56.047 --> 01:49:57.423
Problem.

01:49:57.507 --> 01:50:00.342
See, I promised my little girl
that I'd be comin' home.

01:50:01.344 --> 01:50:04.221
Now, I don't know what you people
are doin' down there,

01:50:04.306 --> 01:50:05.806
but we got a hole to dig up there.

01:50:07.726 --> 01:50:09.602
Go, go, go, go! Come on.
We got work to do.

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:13.439
Okay, guys. All go, no quit.
How ya doin' down there? Good?

01:50:13.523 --> 01:50:16.442
Okay, got the tranny.
We're back in business.

01:50:16.526 --> 01:50:20.362
Hey, you guys should take a break
and come up and see this.

01:50:21.656 --> 01:50:24.450
Wow. Got a great view
of the Earth from here.

01:50:24.534 --> 01:50:26.535
Too bad we'll never
set foot on her again.

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:29.079
- Lev, do you see anything?
- No.

01:50:29.164 --> 01:50:32.458
Well, keep goin'. I'm not givin' up.

01:50:32.542 --> 01:50:34.460
Hold up here, Bear.

01:50:34.544 --> 01:50:36.629
- Oh, boy.
- This is great.

01:50:36.713 --> 01:50:39.632
We just happen to run into
the Grand Canyon on the asteroid?

01:50:39.716 --> 01:50:42.926
I told you, you took a wrong way,
a wrong road.

01:50:43.011 --> 01:50:46.347
What... What road?
Do you see any roads around here?

01:50:46.431 --> 01:50:50.517
You know what? I do not have
much pleasure being near God's ear.

01:50:50.602 --> 01:50:53.145
But you think this is
looking good, or what?

01:50:53.229 --> 01:50:57.441
Lev, why don't you just do humanity
a favor and just shut the hell up?

01:51:02.781 --> 01:51:04.615
Have you ever heard of Evel Knievel?

01:51:04.699 --> 01:51:07.076
No, I never saw Star Wars.

01:51:13.083 --> 01:51:15.542
All right. Doin' a good job.

01:51:15.627 --> 01:51:18.337
- Give me a depth reading, Max.
- We're 150 feet, Harry.

01:51:22.509 --> 01:51:23.676
Yee-ha!

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:27.304
Ride 'em, cowboy!
Yippee-kai-yo, kai-yay!

01:51:27.389 --> 01:51:31.809
Get off the nuclear warhead.

01:51:31.893 --> 01:51:34.561
I was doin' that guy from that movie,
you know, Slim Pickens,

01:51:34.646 --> 01:51:37.106
where he rides it all the way in,
the nuclear warhead.

01:51:37.190 --> 01:51:40.067
- Now.
- Oh, you didn't see that one, huh?

01:51:40.151 --> 01:51:43.028
We got 700 feet of hole to dig,
Rockhound.

01:51:43.113 --> 01:51:47.700
All right. Just... Just wanted to feel
the power between my legs, brother.

01:51:48.827 --> 01:51:50.786
Hey, Sharp.

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:53.747
No nukes!
No nukes! No nukes!

01:51:53.832 --> 01:51:55.833
You got any more bullets
in that gun, Sharp?

01:51:56.167 --> 01:51:58.335
What did Watts tell you, Bear?
If she kicked you in the balls,

01:51:58.420 --> 01:51:59.545
- you'd keep floating.
- Yeah.

01:52:02.465 --> 01:52:04.842
We turn the thrusters off,
we jump this thing,

01:52:04.926 --> 01:52:06.635
we float right over it.

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:09.221
Go over it again, Lev.

01:52:09.305 --> 01:52:12.683
Throw the jet thrusters off
exactly when we jump.

01:52:12.767 --> 01:52:14.268
- Okay.
- And then we're gonna put them on,

01:52:14.352 --> 01:52:16.395
and we gonna go down nice and slow.

01:52:16.479 --> 01:52:20.065
- That's it. That's it, baby. That's it.
- Is this gonna work?

01:52:20.150 --> 01:52:24.236
- I don't know.
- Lev, you know what, just lie to me.

01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:28.240
Let's say 50-50... No. More like, uh...

01:52:28.324 --> 01:52:31.368
Like 70-30 or 80-20.
But you know what?

01:52:31.453 --> 01:52:35.914
If it works, the two of you
gonna be heroes, just like me.

01:52:35.999 --> 01:52:38.834
Screw it.
We're jumpin' over this canyon.

01:52:43.006 --> 01:52:46.008
Just for the record,
this is a very bad idea!

01:52:49.471 --> 01:52:50.554
Wait for the edge.

01:52:50.638 --> 01:52:52.806
- Don't hit it till we get there.
- I'm waiting.

01:52:53.683 --> 01:52:55.976
Three.

01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:59.438
Two. One!

01:53:09.324 --> 01:53:12.618
- Yes! It's working!
- It's working!

01:53:12.702 --> 01:53:13.869
Oh, my God!

01:53:15.288 --> 01:53:20.584
I'm a genius! Wait a minute.

01:53:20.668 --> 01:53:22.753
- We got some rocks!
- Go left! Go left!

01:53:22.837 --> 01:53:25.422
Lev, Lev, I can't do anything!

01:53:35.183 --> 01:53:37.810
Oh, okay, okay,
we're floating into outer space.

01:53:37.894 --> 01:53:39.311
- Check main switch.
- Uh, this could be

01:53:39.395 --> 01:53:41.438
a little bit of a problem.

01:53:41.523 --> 01:53:43.690
- Thrusters on... Now!
- All right, turn 'em on.

01:53:46.861 --> 01:53:48.529
- What's wrong?
- I... I don't know.

01:53:48.613 --> 01:53:52.115
The... The thrusters not working.
I hate this machine!

01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:53.325
I thought you had this planned!

01:53:53.409 --> 01:53:55.077
- What're we supposed to do?
- Be quiet! I must think!

01:53:55.161 --> 01:53:57.830
- I'm stepping outside.
- You're... You're going outside?

01:53:57.914 --> 01:54:03.418
I am the only certified astronaut,
and I'm saving your American ass!

01:54:07.632 --> 01:54:10.092
Yes. You'll listen to him. Right.

01:54:15.265 --> 01:54:19.059
Hurry up, Lev, because we're
about a mile off the asteroid!

01:54:19.143 --> 01:54:22.479
Just a second. The fuel line is iced up.

01:54:22.564 --> 01:54:26.608
- I think maybe workin' now.
- No, Lev, it's not working!

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:29.611
I'm sorry, A.J., I was way off the odds.

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:31.113
We're gettin' higher, man.

01:54:31.197 --> 01:54:34.575
Look out! The rocks! Rocks are coming!

01:54:40.832 --> 01:54:42.374
Hold on!

01:54:46.796 --> 01:54:49.548
- Pull the thrusters!
- Lev, look out!

01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:58.390
- We lost Lev.
- A.J.!

01:54:59.767 --> 01:55:02.060
A.J., the thrusters!

01:55:06.274 --> 01:55:08.025
Let's get Lev back!

01:55:16.492 --> 01:55:19.244
Lev, hold on! We're comin' in!

01:55:35.845 --> 01:55:37.721
Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord.

01:55:37.805 --> 01:55:39.514
Thank You. Thank You,
thank You, thank You, thank You.

01:55:40.141 --> 01:55:42.976
Lev!

01:55:43.686 --> 01:55:48.315
- Now I'm really a Russian hero!
- I told you!

01:55:48.399 --> 01:55:50.776
- I know!
- I knew this would work!

01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:53.195
- Good odds, you know?
- Come on, Lev.

01:55:53.279 --> 01:55:55.948
- Get in here. We gotta go.
- Yah!

01:55:59.577 --> 01:56:01.828
Rockhound, keep on that transmission.

01:56:01.913 --> 01:56:04.957
- Tranny looks good, Harry.
- All right. Take it outta there.

01:56:05.041 --> 01:56:07.000
Lock it down, Chick.

01:56:08.711 --> 01:56:10.253
Nice.

01:56:11.339 --> 01:56:14.549
How come we didn't get
any training on this thing?

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:18.261
Whoa. Very cool. I could take out
this asteroid single-handedly.

01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:21.473
Okay, boys, give it a rest.
I'll take it from here.

01:56:24.644 --> 01:56:26.353
- What the hell is that?
- It's Rockhound.

01:56:26.437 --> 01:56:29.690
Whoa. This is so much fun, it's freaky.

01:56:31.234 --> 01:56:32.192
Rockhound!

01:56:33.569 --> 01:56:35.737
Whoa, watch your heads. Sorry, Harry.

01:56:38.449 --> 01:56:40.826
- Outta my way, boys!
- Rockhound!

01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:43.537
Meet your maker, asteroid!

01:56:48.251 --> 01:56:50.002
What the hell's the matter with you,
Rockhound?

01:56:50.086 --> 01:56:52.004
- Goddamn!
- This is insane.

01:56:52.088 --> 01:56:53.630
- Have you lost your mind?
- No.

01:56:53.715 --> 01:56:57.926
He's got space dementia.
Harry, you want to watch your man.

01:57:00.388 --> 01:57:05.142
Max, downshift and put it in reverse.
We gotta get that pipe outta there.

01:57:05.226 --> 01:57:06.393
Uh-oh.

01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:12.190
- What's happening?
- The ground's cracking!

01:57:12.275 --> 01:57:13.442
Earthquake!

01:57:21.659 --> 01:57:23.535
Quick, shut it off!

01:57:24.954 --> 01:57:28.331
- Shut it off! Shut it off now!
- We're gonna have a blowout!

01:57:28.416 --> 01:57:31.043
- We hit a gas pocket!
- We got pressure out the ass!

01:57:33.296 --> 01:57:36.673
Max, get your helmet on!
Max, she's gonna blow!

01:57:36.758 --> 01:57:40.052
- Aah! Oh, Jesus, I'm cooking!
- Max, get outta there!

01:57:40.136 --> 01:57:44.473
This is it! Harry!

01:57:46.976 --> 01:57:49.019
I'm bailing!

01:57:52.106 --> 01:57:53.648
Max!

01:57:56.319 --> 01:57:57.319
Good-bye, Max.

01:57:57.403 --> 01:58:00.864
- Max!
- Take care, buddy.

01:58:00.948 --> 01:58:03.033
- Armadillo's off the scope.
- I think we've had a blowout.

01:58:03.117 --> 01:58:04.701
No sign of the Armadillo.

01:58:36.275 --> 01:58:38.151
Get a hold of Truman.

01:58:39.779 --> 01:58:41.613
Prepare the world for bad news.

01:58:49.288 --> 01:58:51.665
We're getting
sketchy information that the mission

01:58:51.749 --> 01:58:54.126
has suffered massive failure.

01:58:54.210 --> 01:58:56.795
And what we're trying to do right now
is to confirm that

01:58:56.879 --> 01:58:58.380
and find out exactly what that means.

01:58:58.464 --> 01:59:01.633
Repeat. We're getting leaks
from several NASA officials,

01:59:01.717 --> 01:59:03.468
some rushing home
to be with their families,

01:59:03.553 --> 01:59:07.264
that the drilling was unsuccessful.

01:59:16.065 --> 01:59:18.942
This could very well be our final hour.

01:59:22.446 --> 01:59:24.447
We're gonna go off the air now.

01:59:24.532 --> 01:59:26.825
Good luck and God bless.

01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:32.914
- We've got incoming.
- I got tracks.

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:35.625
NORAD's tracking four small
incoming over Europe.

01:59:35.710 --> 01:59:37.043
I think one's about to hit near Paris.

02:00:03.446 --> 02:00:04.905
Reports are coming in.

02:00:04.989 --> 02:00:07.532
Martial law
has been implemented in 42 countries.

02:00:07.617 --> 02:00:10.076
Once the asteroid hits zero barrier,

02:00:10.161 --> 02:00:14.414
it will take about three hours
and 57 minutes to impact Earth.

02:00:18.502 --> 02:00:21.129
I guess we do it the president's way.
I'll order an evac.

02:00:21.214 --> 02:00:22.464
You can remote detonate.

02:00:22.548 --> 02:00:24.174
You still don't think this'll work, do you?

02:00:24.258 --> 02:00:25.926
What I think is irrelevant.

02:00:26.010 --> 02:00:29.095
- We need to do it now.
- Fine.

02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:31.348
- Can they still take off?
- We hope so.

02:00:31.432 --> 02:00:33.475
You are the one that
pulled them into this!

02:00:33.559 --> 02:00:37.062
That is my family up there,
so I don't wanna hear, "We hope so"!

02:00:42.652 --> 02:00:46.363
Guess what, guys?
It's time to embrace the horror.

02:00:46.447 --> 02:00:49.950
Look. We got front-row tickets
to the end of the Earth.

02:01:12.056 --> 02:01:13.515
Yeah!

02:01:13.599 --> 02:01:14.891
Way to go, baby!

02:01:14.976 --> 02:01:16.309
Harry!

02:01:23.276 --> 02:01:25.568
Yo, Harry! What's up, baby?

02:01:25.653 --> 02:01:28.321
Hey, get that bomb outta there!
We got a hole to make!

02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:31.616
Houston, you're not gonna believe this,

02:01:31.701 --> 02:01:33.034
but the other Armadillo has arrived.

02:01:35.246 --> 02:01:38.206
All right, people, listen up.
Settle down and focus.

02:01:38.291 --> 02:01:40.709
- Mechanical, get on-line.
- P.P.O., gimme a setup.

02:01:40.793 --> 02:01:42.711
Your boyfriend's back.

02:01:43.212 --> 02:01:44.254
Yo, Harry!

02:01:47.216 --> 02:01:49.217
Hey, Harry. You miss me?

02:01:49.302 --> 02:01:52.721
A.J., I got just five words for ya.

02:01:52.805 --> 02:01:55.974
- Damn glad to see ya, boy!
- That's six words.

02:01:56.058 --> 02:01:57.350
Chick, walk 'em down.

02:01:57.435 --> 02:01:58.977
So where's this hole
you need dug?

02:01:59.603 --> 02:02:02.230
Houston, drilling has recommenced.

02:02:02.315 --> 02:02:05.900
Do you think they can drill
250 feet in an hour?

02:02:05.985 --> 02:02:07.485
They better.

02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.529
Bring that piece on in, Bear.

02:02:10.531 --> 02:02:12.198
Tractor pull.

02:02:12.908 --> 02:02:16.661
- I'm comin' down!
- We got 250 feet to go.

02:02:16.746 --> 02:02:19.748
It's our last transmission, last drill head.

02:02:19.832 --> 02:02:23.335
Punch it through.
First gear. We got contact.

02:02:24.045 --> 02:02:25.420
Come on down, A.J.

02:02:27.673 --> 02:02:28.923
I got this, man. Let's go!

02:02:29.008 --> 02:02:30.675
Lev, the right engine hub.

02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:33.011
Houston, I'm getting no response
from the preflight sequence.

02:02:33.095 --> 02:02:36.681
Come on, now.
This is not... Hey... Hey, come here.

02:02:36.766 --> 02:02:39.059
Can you get me outta here, please, Lev?
Thank you.

02:02:40.936 --> 02:02:43.980
- Ow! Jesus! Hey!
- Wait.

02:02:44.065 --> 02:02:45.190
- Lev, the right engine...
- Okay.

02:02:45.274 --> 02:02:49.778
Lemme outta here, will ya?
Just tryin' to have some fun before I die!

02:02:49.862 --> 02:02:53.490
- How deep are we?
- Seven seventy.

02:02:58.788 --> 02:03:00.914
- Whoa, they got problems.
- The gauges are spiking.

02:03:00.998 --> 02:03:02.999
Methane! Shut it down! Back it down!

02:03:03.084 --> 02:03:05.126
I can't pull back now.
The bit'll get lodged.

02:03:05.211 --> 02:03:07.212
We don't have enough time!

02:03:07.296 --> 02:03:10.965
Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's gonna blow!
It's how we lost Max!

02:03:11.050 --> 02:03:13.259
I know what I'm talkin' about.
We can punch through this.

02:03:13.344 --> 02:03:14.928
We can knock this outta the park.

02:03:15.012 --> 02:03:16.846
This is our last transmission, A.J.

02:03:16.931 --> 02:03:19.140
Goddamn it, if you're ever
gonna trust me, ever,

02:03:19.225 --> 02:03:22.102
once in your life, trust me now!

02:03:22.186 --> 02:03:23.895
Harry, it's gonna blow!

02:03:23.979 --> 02:03:27.065
Harry, I know what I'm doin'.
You just gotta trust me.

02:03:28.526 --> 02:03:30.485
Make the call.

02:03:32.738 --> 02:03:35.156
All right. Hold on.
I'm pushin' through her.

02:03:40.871 --> 02:03:42.872
I'm pushin' through her!

02:03:43.582 --> 02:03:46.751
- What's your depth?
- Seven seventy-five. Seven eighty.

02:03:46.836 --> 02:03:49.129
Take it up, baby! Ram it home!

02:03:49.713 --> 02:03:51.589
Drive on down, A.J.!

02:03:51.674 --> 02:03:54.259
Seven eighty-five. Come on. Come on.

02:03:54.343 --> 02:03:56.511
- Come on, A.J.!
- Punch it!

02:03:56.595 --> 02:03:57.595
Ninety-one. Come on.

02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:00.765
Seven ninety-two. Seven ninety-five!

02:04:00.850 --> 02:04:03.017
Drive it down, A.J.!

02:04:03.102 --> 02:04:06.020
Seven ninety-seven! Ninety-nine!

02:04:06.105 --> 02:04:09.774
- Breakthrough!
- Eight hundred! Eight-oh-two, Harry!

02:04:09.859 --> 02:04:11.568
- Yeah!
- We did it!

02:04:13.487 --> 02:04:15.029
- Yes!
- We did it!

02:04:15.114 --> 02:04:19.242
- Yeah! Kid, way to go!
- I knew it, baby!

02:04:19.326 --> 02:04:21.327
It's not over till we get
the bomb down that hole.

02:04:21.412 --> 02:04:23.079
Watts, they've got 38 minutes.

02:04:44.018 --> 02:04:45.560
Harry,
you've gotta give me that hole.

02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:48.688
I'm gonna need two more minutes.
I got a bent pipe jammed in the hole.

02:04:48.772 --> 02:04:52.484
We gotta cut it out before
we can send that bomb down. A.J.!

02:04:52.568 --> 02:04:54.611
- She good to go?
- Yeah, I'm all set.

02:04:54.695 --> 02:04:56.070
All right.

02:05:01.452 --> 02:05:03.620
- All right.
- A.J., come on! Make it fast!

02:05:03.704 --> 02:05:06.998
I'm goin' as fast as I can!
There's a lot of gas pressure!

02:05:13.923 --> 02:05:15.006
You feel that?

02:05:15.090 --> 02:05:17.258
Harry, you gotta give me that hole.
The bomb is almost ready.

02:05:17.343 --> 02:05:19.928
- Pull that pipe out!
- Harry, I'm almost through!

02:05:20.012 --> 02:05:21.054
Give me 15 more seconds!

02:05:27.186 --> 02:05:29.312
Well, this is somethin' new.

02:05:31.982 --> 02:05:33.024
I don't think this thing likes us.

02:05:33.108 --> 02:05:36.152
That's 'cause it knows
we're here to kill it.

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:43.368
Hey, what's goin' on up there?

02:05:48.123 --> 02:05:49.541
A.J.!

02:05:50.918 --> 02:05:53.211
- What the hell was that?
- A.J.!

02:05:53.796 --> 02:05:55.838
Goddamn it, I'm finished!

02:05:56.632 --> 02:05:59.467
- A.J., you all right?
- Oh, lot of gas pressure in here, man!

02:05:59.552 --> 02:06:02.220
- Get me out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hydrogen pocket!

02:06:19.488 --> 02:06:22.657
Oh! Harry! Pull me in!

02:06:25.744 --> 02:06:28.204
Aah! A.J., hang on!

02:06:34.295 --> 02:06:36.004
Secure the bomb!

02:06:37.172 --> 02:06:39.007
Sharp, heads up!

02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:42.302
Gruber! Get outta there now!

02:06:43.887 --> 02:06:45.305
Oh, no.

02:06:53.188 --> 02:06:55.148
Oh, God, no!

02:07:01.697 --> 02:07:03.281
Look out!

02:07:06.243 --> 02:07:09.370
Help! Oh, no!

02:07:16.670 --> 02:07:18.087
Do you believe that just happened?

02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:24.427
- Sharp, you all right?
- I'm okay.

02:07:24.511 --> 02:07:26.971
- Bear?
- Yeah. I'm here, Harry.

02:07:27.056 --> 02:07:29.557
- A.J.?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

02:07:32.186 --> 02:07:33.728
We lost Gruber.

02:07:35.397 --> 02:07:36.898
Gruber's dead.

02:07:37.650 --> 02:07:39.400
Let's get that bomb ready and go home.

02:07:47.409 --> 02:07:48.493
Oh, my God.

02:07:50.287 --> 02:07:52.163
Is there a problem, Colonel?

02:07:52.247 --> 02:07:54.832
The timer, the remote,
the whole thing's dead.

02:07:54.917 --> 02:07:57.001
What, the bomb is dead?

02:07:57.086 --> 02:07:58.419
No, the trigger's dead.

02:07:58.504 --> 02:08:01.673
It must've gotten damaged
during the rock storm.

02:08:03.092 --> 02:08:05.093
So how do we detonate it?

02:08:14.895 --> 02:08:19.190
We have 18 minutes to zero barrier.
We got some bad news.

02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:23.695
The remote detonator on the bomb
has been damaged.

02:08:23.779 --> 02:08:26.656
That means that somebody's
gonna have to stay behind.

02:08:28.742 --> 02:08:31.244
It takes two people to fly this thing.

02:08:31.328 --> 02:08:35.123
Either we all stay and die,
or you guys draw straws.

02:08:35.999 --> 02:08:39.836
I say we all stay and die. But that's me.

02:08:40.879 --> 02:08:44.340
I'll draw. Let's draw.

02:08:45.092 --> 02:08:48.010
Nobody's gonna draw straws.

02:08:48.095 --> 02:08:49.387
I'll stay and take care of it.

02:08:49.471 --> 02:08:51.514
- Well, I can't live with that sort of thing.
- Nobody asked you

02:08:51.598 --> 02:08:52.807
- if you could live with it, all right?
- Bullshit!

02:08:52.891 --> 02:08:55.476
No way I will let you volunteer for this

02:08:55.561 --> 02:08:59.439
so I can go back to my home country
like the man who didn't volunteer.

02:08:59.523 --> 02:09:01.149
No way!

02:09:01.233 --> 02:09:05.695
Hey, man, let's draw, and let's see
who's gonna stay up here and dance.

02:09:05.779 --> 02:09:08.531
Guys, I... I know you guys
think I'm crazy right now,

02:09:08.615 --> 02:09:11.617
but I would really like this responsibility.

02:09:12.411 --> 02:09:15.580
- All right. All right.
- I can do it.

02:09:15.664 --> 02:09:17.498
Let's just draw straws
and get it over with. Come on.

02:09:17.583 --> 02:09:19.250
I ain't drawin' against you, Harry.

02:09:19.334 --> 02:09:20.793
Well, I'm gonna draw
against you, Chick,

02:09:20.878 --> 02:09:23.546
so you better just go ahead and do it.

02:09:24.256 --> 02:09:26.090
Just gimme this thing.

02:09:33.766 --> 02:09:35.975
Is this good or bad?

02:09:41.732 --> 02:09:43.274
Oh, man.

02:09:44.568 --> 02:09:47.445
Well, we all gotta die, right?

02:09:50.699 --> 02:09:53.659
I'm the guy who gets
to do it saving the world.

02:09:53.744 --> 02:09:57.330
So, uh, let's go.
We... We got about ten minutes, right?

02:09:59.208 --> 02:10:01.334
You plug this into the port.

02:10:01.418 --> 02:10:05.588
Lift, press, hold. That's it.

02:10:05.672 --> 02:10:10.218
Lift, press, hold. Shouldn't be too tough.
Even I can't screw this up.

02:10:10.302 --> 02:10:12.094
I'll take him down.

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:52.552
Do me a favor, will ya?
Just tell Grace that, uh...

02:10:52.636 --> 02:10:55.388
That I'll always be with her, okay?

02:10:57.432 --> 02:10:59.392
Can you do that?

02:11:00.936 --> 02:11:03.271
Yeah. Okay, kid.

02:11:09.945 --> 02:11:11.696
Give this to Truman.

02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:14.949
Make sure Truman gets that.
Get in there.

02:11:20.914 --> 02:11:22.582
It's my turn now.

02:11:22.666 --> 02:11:26.335
Harry! Harry!

02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:30.965
You can't do this to me! It's my job!

02:11:31.967 --> 02:11:35.970
You go take care of my little girl now.
That's your job.

02:11:39.516 --> 02:11:43.144
Always thought of you as a son. Always.

02:11:43.896 --> 02:11:47.023
But I'd be damn proud
to have you marry Grace.

02:11:48.150 --> 02:11:51.485
- Harry.
- You take care of yourself.

02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:52.862
- Harry, no!
- I love you, pal.

02:11:52.946 --> 02:11:56.240
Harry, I love you! Don't, Harry!
Wait a minute!

02:11:56.325 --> 02:11:58.659
- My son.
- Don't do this, Harry!

02:11:58.744 --> 02:12:01.621
Don't do this! Harry!

02:12:09.922 --> 02:12:12.006
What happened?

02:12:12.090 --> 02:12:14.550
That crazy, stubborn son of a...

02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:23.684
Well, this was a real good idea.

02:12:24.645 --> 02:12:28.147
All right, let's go, Sharp.
Let's get our team outta here.

02:12:33.487 --> 02:12:37.990
Come on! Let's get ready
to initiate thrusters! Let's go!

02:12:38.075 --> 02:12:40.826
- Strap it in, guys!
- Get the O2 masks.

02:12:40.911 --> 02:12:43.454
Are they green? Are they green?

02:12:43.538 --> 02:12:45.665
I can't believe this is
going down like this.

02:12:45.749 --> 02:12:47.166
You all right?

02:12:47.250 --> 02:12:50.503
- O2 vents locked, pressure loaded.
- Engine board is green.

02:12:53.256 --> 02:12:56.008
T minus three minutes
and counting.

02:12:56.093 --> 02:12:58.803
Houston, do you copy?
This is Harry Stamper.

02:12:59.930 --> 02:13:01.555
It's down there.

02:13:03.725 --> 02:13:08.187
- Electrical systems primed.
- A.P.U. is set. Oxidizers are loading.

02:13:08.689 --> 02:13:12.233
Houston, we're outta here
in T minus three minutes.

02:13:13.193 --> 02:13:15.277
Daddy!

02:13:15.362 --> 02:13:18.656
Hi, Gracie. Hi, honey.

02:13:19.157 --> 02:13:22.618
Grace, I know I promised you
I was comin' home.

02:13:23.912 --> 02:13:25.913
I don't under... Understand.

02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:30.084
Looks like I'm gonna
have to break that promise.

02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:36.549
I, um... I lied to you, too,

02:13:36.633 --> 02:13:39.844
when I told you that
I didn't want to be like you.

02:13:41.513 --> 02:13:43.431
Because I am like you.

02:13:44.224 --> 02:13:48.477
And everything good that I have
inside of me, I have from you.

02:13:49.771 --> 02:13:51.856
I love you so much, Daddy.

02:13:52.441 --> 02:13:54.233
I'm so proud of you.

02:13:55.027 --> 02:13:58.738
I'm so scared.

02:13:59.865 --> 02:14:04.535
I know it, baby, but there won't be
anything to be scared of soon.

02:14:07.122 --> 02:14:11.959
Gracie, I want you to know
that A.J. saved us. He did.

02:14:14.379 --> 02:14:16.297
I want you to tell Chick

02:14:16.381 --> 02:14:19.675
that I couldn't have done it without him,
none of it.

02:14:21.803 --> 02:14:24.138
I want you to take care of A.J.

02:14:28.643 --> 02:14:31.479
I wish I could be there
to walk you down the aisle.

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:36.317
But I'll...

02:14:38.528 --> 02:14:42.281
I'll look in on you
from time to time, okay, honey?

02:14:44.826 --> 02:14:46.285
I love you, Grace.

02:14:46.369 --> 02:14:48.496
I love you, too.

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:51.373
- I gotta go now, honey.
- Daddy, no.

02:14:52.167 --> 02:14:54.835
No, no, Dad, no.

02:15:01.676 --> 02:15:05.221
O.M.S. pod pre-start.
O2 vents locked, pressure loaded.

02:15:07.182 --> 02:15:09.600
What the hell's goin' on up there?
Why haven't you guys left yet?

02:15:09.684 --> 02:15:12.103
We're going, Harry. Houston.

02:15:12.187 --> 02:15:14.980
- We got O.M.S. pod pre-start.
- Pod pre-start confirmed.

02:15:18.610 --> 02:15:19.652
- What's the problem?
- I don't know.

02:15:19.736 --> 02:15:21.112
- What's wrong?
- Fix it now!

02:15:23.156 --> 02:15:25.282
No time, no time!

02:15:25.367 --> 02:15:27.326
- What?
- What's that?

02:15:31.206 --> 02:15:33.457
- Where you goin'?
- Come on. We're stayin', we're goin'.

02:15:33.542 --> 02:15:35.459
We're stayin', we're goin'.
Make up your mind.

02:15:35.544 --> 02:15:38.712
Sharp, get out of here now.
You got less than three minutes.

02:15:42.759 --> 02:15:44.260
Come on, Watts. Come on, come on.

02:15:44.344 --> 02:15:46.554
Blow the bomb, Harry. We're with you.

02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:50.307
- Uh, it's stuck. Yes?
- You don't know the components!

02:15:50.392 --> 02:15:53.894
Components, American components,
Russian components.

02:15:53.979 --> 02:15:55.521
All made in Taiwan!

02:15:55.856 --> 02:15:58.274
We're gettin' tight for ignition, Freedom.

02:16:01.027 --> 02:16:02.403
Houston, we've got no fire.

02:16:02.487 --> 02:16:04.572
- What does that mean?
- It means we got a busted ship.

02:16:04.656 --> 02:16:07.241
A busted ship?
And I'm strapped in here.

02:16:07.325 --> 02:16:09.243
I had a great spot picked out there.

02:16:09.619 --> 02:16:10.744
Freedom, you fire that engine.

02:16:10.829 --> 02:16:12.913
If there's not a way, you find a way.
The clock's tickin'.

02:16:12.998 --> 02:16:14.874
Let's go!
Let's fire that engine, Freedom!

02:16:15.584 --> 02:16:18.752
You got less than a minute.
Don't think I won't blow this thing.

02:16:20.672 --> 02:16:23.174
Sharp, get out of here.
It's gettin' bad down here.

02:16:23.258 --> 02:16:25.342
I know how to fix it. Please, move.

02:16:25.427 --> 02:16:27.761
I... I have to take you away
if you don't move.

02:16:27.846 --> 02:16:30.848
Watts, you gotta get that shuttle started.
You gotta fire it up now!

02:16:30.932 --> 02:16:32.892
Damn it, Sharp. Get off this rock!

02:16:32.976 --> 02:16:35.059
I'm telling you, please, move!

02:16:35.145 --> 02:16:40.357
This is how we fix problem
in the Russian space station.

02:16:40.441 --> 02:16:43.527
Because I don't want
to stay here anymore.

02:16:45.362 --> 02:16:49.241
Yeah! Finally! We can go home!

02:16:49.325 --> 02:16:51.660
- She's coming back. She's coming back.
- We're hot!

02:16:51.745 --> 02:16:54.288
Watts! Let's go, let's go!

02:16:54.748 --> 02:16:57.458
Rain all you want, you son of a bitch.

02:16:58.168 --> 02:17:01.212
Let's go! We don't have time!
Hurry, hurry. We got no time!

02:17:01.296 --> 02:17:03.254
Initiate thrusters on my mark!

02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:05.216
Two, one, mark!

02:17:13.266 --> 02:17:15.100
Come on. Get some altitude.
Let's go, let's go.

02:17:18.438 --> 02:17:20.522
Freedom has max thrust!

02:17:27.322 --> 02:17:29.114
Thank you, Harry.

02:17:40.126 --> 02:17:41.919
Shuttle's out of range.
Still no detonation.

02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:49.093
Something's not right.
Too much time has gone by.

02:17:51.346 --> 02:17:53.597
Zero barrier's about to be breached.
One minute.

02:17:53.682 --> 02:17:56.433
Harry, come on. Press that button.

02:17:56.518 --> 02:18:00.728
- We're goin' back and do it ourselves.
- Just don't. Wait one minute.

02:18:04.942 --> 02:18:06.527
Dan, we're about to cross the threshold.

02:18:06.611 --> 02:18:07.903
Come on. Press the button.

02:18:07.987 --> 02:18:12.866
Colonel, I'm askin' you.
Just one more minute!

02:18:19.624 --> 02:18:21.416
Press the button, Stamper.

02:18:24.587 --> 02:18:25.879
Come on.

02:18:28.717 --> 02:18:31.010
Harry'll do it. I know it.

02:18:32.387 --> 02:18:33.887
He doesn't know how to fail.

02:18:41.771 --> 02:18:43.564
We win, Gracie!

02:18:44.607 --> 02:18:45.691
Press it!

02:19:18.933 --> 02:19:22.019
We have detonation.
Confirming detonation.

02:19:39.537 --> 02:19:41.871
The two halves are gonna miss us
by 400 miles,

02:19:41.956 --> 02:19:44.875
and most of the small particles
have been vaporized.

02:19:56.304 --> 02:19:59.056
- Houston, we're comin' home.
- We copy that, Freedom.

02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:02.476
Yo, Harry, you the man.

02:20:55.780 --> 02:20:59.616
Kennedy, we see you.
And you never looked so good.

02:20:59.701 --> 02:21:03.328
I never told anybody this before
but I hate flyin',

02:21:03.413 --> 02:21:05.330
so it'd be an awful shame to die now.

02:21:05.415 --> 02:21:09.668
That's easy for you to say. I owe
100 grand to a bad-ass loan shark,

02:21:09.752 --> 02:21:12.379
which I spent on a stripper
named Molly Mounds.

02:21:12.505 --> 02:21:14.047
Boy, that's bad.

02:21:14.132 --> 02:21:17.759
Kennedy, we are 100 percent.
Flap suspension control on full.

02:21:30.773 --> 02:21:32.733
Welcome home, astronauts.

02:21:41.159 --> 02:21:43.452
Hey, guys, remember,
we're heroes now.

02:21:43.536 --> 02:21:45.913
So that incident with me
and the gun on the asteroid,

02:21:45.997 --> 02:21:48.457
let's keep that under wraps, all right?

02:22:52.689 --> 02:22:54.439
Miss Stamper.

02:22:56.067 --> 02:22:58.819
Colonel Willie Sharp,
United States Air Force, ma'am.

02:22:59.487 --> 02:23:02.447
Requesting permission to shake
the hand of the daughter

02:23:02.532 --> 02:23:04.992
of the bravest man I've ever met.

02:23:11.499 --> 02:23:12.916
Hello.

02:23:13.001 --> 02:23:15.752
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, you're my hero.

02:23:15.837 --> 02:23:18.547
Oh, baby, I wanna have babies with you.

02:23:21.676 --> 02:23:23.635
Welcome back, cowboy.

02:23:25.179 --> 02:23:29.433
Uh, Harry wanted you to have this.

02:23:35.898 --> 02:23:37.608
He did, huh?

02:23:56.127 --> 02:23:57.711
I could stay awake

02:23:57.795 --> 02:24:01.548
Just to hear you breathin'

02:24:03.051 --> 02:24:06.553
Watch you smile while you are sleepin'

02:24:07.055 --> 02:24:10.849
While you're far away and dreamin'

02:24:11.643 --> 02:24:15.187
I just wanna stay with you

02:24:15.271 --> 02:24:18.440
In this moment forever

02:24:18.524 --> 02:24:21.234
Forever and ever

02:24:21.319 --> 02:24:25.322
I don't wanna close my eyes

02:24:25.406 --> 02:24:27.824
I don't wanna fall asleep

02:24:27.909 --> 02:24:30.035
'Cause I miss you, baby

02:24:30.119 --> 02:24:32.954
And I don't wanna miss a thing

02:24:33.206 --> 02:24:36.750
'Cause even when I dream of you

02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:39.836
The sweetest dream would never do

02:24:39.921 --> 02:24:41.922
I'd still miss you, baby

02:24:42.006 --> 02:24:45.175
And I don't wanna miss a thing

02:24:45.259 --> 02:24:49.179
And I don't wanna miss one smile

02:24:49.263 --> 02:24:52.599
And I don't wanna miss one kiss

02:24:53.226 --> 02:24:56.770
Well, I just wanna be
with you right here

02:24:56.854 --> 02:25:00.607
With you just like this

02:25:01.025 --> 02:25:04.903
Well, I just wanna hold you close

02:25:05.113 --> 02:25:09.032
Feel your heart so close to mine

02:25:09.575 --> 02:25:13.078
And just stay here in this moment

02:25:13.162 --> 02:25:17.833
For all the rest of time

02:25:18.084 --> 02:25:20.168
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:25:20.253 --> 02:25:23.046
Yeah

02:25:23.214 --> 02:25:26.341
Don't wanna close my eyes

02:25:26.968 --> 02:25:29.428
I don't wanna fall asleep

02:25:29.512 --> 02:25:31.513
'Cause I miss you, baby

02:25:31.597 --> 02:25:34.683
And I don't wanna miss a thing

02:25:34.809 --> 02:25:38.353
'Cause even when I dream of you

02:25:38.813 --> 02:25:41.273
The sweetest dream would never do

02:25:41.357 --> 02:25:43.400
I'd still miss you, baby

02:25:43.484 --> 02:25:46.403
And I don't wanna miss a thing

02:25:46.946 --> 02:25:49.656
Don't wanna close my eyes

02:25:50.116 --> 02:25:54.369
I don't wanna fall asleep

02:25:54.454 --> 02:25:58.123
Yeah
I don't wanna miss a thing

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:08.021
All my bags are packed
I'm ready to go

02:29:08.356 --> 02:29:11.733
I'm standin' here outside your door

02:29:12.193 --> 02:29:17.322
I hate to wake you up to say good-bye

02:29:19.158 --> 02:29:23.036
But the dawn is breakin'
It's early morn

02:29:23.496 --> 02:29:27.207
The taxi's waitin'
He's blowin' his horn

02:29:27.375 --> 02:29:30.794
Already I'm so lonesome

02:29:30.878 --> 02:29:32.879
I could die

02:29:34.548 --> 02:29:38.969
So kiss me and smile for me

02:29:39.387 --> 02:29:42.889
Tell me that you'll wait for me

02:29:43.224 --> 02:29:48.478
Hold me like you'll never let me go

02:29:49.981 --> 02:29:54.651
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane

02:29:54.860 --> 02:29:58.738
I don't know when I'll be back again

02:29:59.407 --> 02:30:04.035
Oh, babe, I hate to go

02:30:05.287 --> 02:30:09.874
I'm leaving on a jet plane

02:30:10.126 --> 02:30:25.056
Leaving on a jet plane

02:30:26.305 --> 02:30:32.767
