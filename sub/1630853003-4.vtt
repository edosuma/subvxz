-Gimme it!
No, let me try again!

-Host 2:

10:26.292 --> 10:28.294
supposedly off of
his X's and O's.

10:28.377 --> 10:32.506
And what happens if
McKinney just can't hack it?

10:32.590 --> 10:34.050
...with 21 guys,

10:34.133 --> 10:35.760
Woman:
Hand me the screwdriver.

Host 2:

Michael Cooper.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.889
Host:
Yeah, my guess is the last
thing he'll hear this week?

10:39.972 --> 10:42.683
-"Hey, Coach wants
to see you. Hit the road."
-You hear that?

10:42.767 --> 10:44.518
They're talking
about me.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.729
I should call myself
Shit Luck Cooper.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.481
Now, I'm gonna roll
into camp late,

10:48.564 --> 10:50.691
-new coach doesn't know my ass.
-Woman: Hand me the screwdriver.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.360
I'm telling you, God is
sending me a message.

10:52.443 --> 10:56.364

Basketball ain't for you.

-Love you, babe.

Host (on radio):
You wanna talk about
big question marks?

11:08.793 --> 11:10.336
The biggest unknown is Kareem.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.964
32 years old, 10 seasons
on those skinny bones.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.634
His best days
are way behind him.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.469
I don't even know
if he wants to be here.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.388
-I'll put on some music.
-He may be the best center

11:20.471 --> 11:21.847
ever to play the game
of basketball...

11:21.931 --> 11:23.766
-Leave it.
-...but if you look in
the encyclopedia

11:23.849 --> 11:27.770
under "checked out,"
you're gonna see a picture
of his frowning face.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.939

getting settled in LA.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.590
Hey, Jack,
I just wanna thank you.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.467
It's been a real rough year.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.970
One bad season,
those alumni turned on me

12:01.053 --> 12:03.139
like Senators on Caesar.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.682
Took my whistle,

12:04.765 --> 12:06.642
stuck me teaching
freshmen philistines

12:06.725 --> 12:09.395
who still think Brutus is
a character from "Popeye."

12:11.188 --> 12:13.149
Well, had me thinking
basketball was done with me,

12:13.232 --> 12:15.401
and then
I heard from you.

12:15.484 --> 12:19.029
True hope is swift and flies
with swallow's wings.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.906
Sort of surprised they
went for me, actually.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.784
-You know, the-the team.
-Yeah, they didn't want to.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.161
Oh.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.705
I insisted. I told them
my system isn't easy,

12:27.788 --> 12:29.832
and neither am I.
And that you were

12:29.915 --> 12:31.417
an expert on them both.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.919
Thanks, Jack.

I figure we'll do that
tomorrow morning.

(projector continues whirring)

18:38.700 --> 18:39.993
Nineteen seconds.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.496
That's three plays,
two conversions,

18:42.579 --> 18:45.332
62 seconds of game time,
for four points a minute,

18:45.415 --> 18:48.126
which, at a roughly
66% conversion rate,

18:48.210 --> 18:50.337
that's close to
a hundred points a game.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.048
In line with the league
average because this

18:53.131 --> 18:56.385
is how everybody in
the league plays basketball.

18:56.468 --> 19:00.722

predictable, and slow.

this happens.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.227

Five seconds.
Three sets of hands.
One easy basket.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.443
only do this six or seven
times a contest?

19:13.527 --> 19:14.862
Ron Boone:
Because it ain't a choice.

19:14.945 --> 19:17.197
They miss, we get the rebound,

19:17.281 --> 19:20.117
maybe a steal, we get out
ahead, and we go for it.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.535
Ain't no way we can
do that all the time.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.579
-Why not?
-Breaking ain't something
we can count on.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.164
Not when you're only running
off of other teams' mistakes,

19:26.248 --> 19:27.583
misses, and steals.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.251
That's why, from now on,

19:29.334 --> 19:31.795
we won't wait for anyone
to give us breaks.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.630
We'll make our own.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.508
Constant motion offense.
