00:32.750 --> 00:34.375
My mother told me a story once.

00:35.792 --> 00:39.000
About a creature my father met.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.750
With a hunger for men

00:42.750 --> 00:44.375
and lust for women.

02:35.250 --> 02:38.625
What lived in the trees now lives within.

04:46.496 --> 04:48.531
You better be thankful
you weren't arrested, boy.

04:48.931 --> 04:50.598
It's only been less than a year

04:50.600 --> 04:52.602
and it's the second time now
you've almost been caught.

04:53.401 --> 04:54.869
They knew my black ID was fake.

04:54.871 --> 04:56.672
But I was careful,
sir, I promise.

04:57.039 --> 04:58.641
And they didn't see my face.

04:59.075 --> 05:00.543
You can't show weakness, boy.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.946
You won't survive
out here if you do.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.350
Things will be different
when we get to the motel.

05:09.051 --> 05:10.853
Don't expect the same
comforts you had in the city.

05:18.494 --> 05:19.862
They don't even
make these at home anymore.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.599
Mama used to smoke
this when I was a kid.

05:24.734 --> 05:25.635
It was hers.

05:28.504 --> 05:29.639
Long time ago, isn't it?

07:32.662 --> 07:35.064
I'm sorry, it's too cold.

07:49.078 --> 07:50.012
Bring the supplies.

08:46.035 --> 08:47.203
This will make you untouchable.

08:49.905 --> 08:52.074
Well, almost.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.641
It wasn't easy
getting you here, boy.

08:54.643 --> 08:56.746
And it sure as fuck
wasn't cheap either.

08:57.780 --> 08:59.680
But you have my blood
in your brown veins.

08:59.682 --> 09:00.916
That's the only
reason you're here.

09:01.350 --> 09:02.218
Hey!

09:03.686 --> 09:05.121
I've been waiting
here forever, man.

09:06.122 --> 09:07.123
You've got to feed me.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.091
I'll eat anything.

09:14.196 --> 09:16.532
- Come on, you said that...
- I said what?

09:18.334 --> 09:20.269
Isn't this place
meant for immigrants?

09:21.704 --> 09:22.836
Do you see any around?

09:22.838 --> 09:24.772
- That woman, Angeli...
- Not me.

09:24.774 --> 09:27.710
...she said that this
all comes with my documents.

09:29.245 --> 09:31.714
Hot food and bed, too.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.820
I think that woman's mouth
tends to run, doesn't it?

09:39.989 --> 09:41.855
Food's not going to be hot,

09:41.857 --> 09:43.357
and I get to pick
where you sleep.

09:43.359 --> 09:45.959
You're free to walk
back to that cabin.

09:45.961 --> 09:49.165
In this weather?
Are you fucking kidding?

09:51.033 --> 09:53.669
I'm all paid up,
man, with extras!

09:55.337 --> 09:56.172
Hey!

10:19.028 --> 10:21.664
You'll see there's
a system in place here, boy.

10:24.033 --> 10:25.968
It strikes a very
delicate balance.

10:29.705 --> 10:31.140
One thing out of order...

10:33.375 --> 10:35.010
and it all slips into chaos!

10:43.719 --> 10:44.720
Can I trust you, boy?

10:46.455 --> 10:48.023
I'm your son, sir.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.993
Yes, but children disappoint
their parents all the time.

10:52.228 --> 10:53.028
I need proof.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.197
How?

10:55.998 --> 10:58.165
Our friend's clothes are filthy.

10:58.167 --> 10:59.168
Tell him to get rid of them.

11:03.139 --> 11:04.373
You want him to strip?

11:06.075 --> 11:08.408
What I want is to get
rid of his clothes

11:08.410 --> 11:10.077
and all traces of
him being here.

11:10.079 --> 11:12.112
Yes, but you can do
that inside the motel.

11:12.114 --> 11:15.017
No, I don't want him
dragging his grime inside.

11:15.918 --> 11:16.685
What will he wear?

11:17.219 --> 11:18.387
Sorry?

11:18.954 --> 11:20.220
What will he wear?

11:20.222 --> 11:21.824
Is this difficult for you, boy?

11:22.992 --> 11:23.792
Are you shy?

11:28.964 --> 11:30.264
Why are we doing this, sir?

11:30.266 --> 11:31.967
Why are you doing this, sir?

11:32.368 --> 11:34.069
Or are you not ready
to take charge?

11:35.404 --> 11:36.872
It should be easy
for you though.

11:37.907 --> 11:39.041
He's one of your kind.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.816
Hey... uh, are you Filipino?

11:50.042 --> 11:51.292
What's your name?

11:52.755 --> 11:54.690
Dee, Dee Hernandez.

11:56.958 --> 11:58.792
Dee. Listen, okay?

12:00.417 --> 12:02.042
I know this might sound a little...

12:02.917 --> 12:04.000
But I need you to listen.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.417
And I need your cooperation.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.956
Remove all your clothes
before going to your room.

12:10.958 --> 12:11.875
You crazy?

12:12.341 --> 12:14.107
No fucking way!

12:14.109 --> 12:15.409
I knew it!

12:15.411 --> 12:17.746
God damn fucking perverts.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.167
Dee! You still hungry?

12:21.417 --> 12:22.665
Look!

12:22.667 --> 12:24.373
Do it and this is yours.

12:24.375 --> 12:25.956
I've already paid for that!

12:25.958 --> 12:27.488
I've already paid for that, motherfucker!

12:27.490 --> 12:28.724
Dee, please.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.583
Do me a favor.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.427
Do me a favor. Help me get this over with.

12:33.429 --> 12:35.130
Stop begging, J.C..

12:35.898 --> 12:37.498
Take your fucking clothes off,
man, or leave!

12:37.500 --> 12:39.266
I'll leave then!

12:39.268 --> 12:41.270
Just give me back
my fucking money.

12:41.937 --> 12:43.239
Cold doesn't scare me.

12:44.042 --> 12:46.123
If the cold doesn't get you,

12:46.125 --> 12:47.915
the border patrol will.

12:47.917 --> 12:50.542
They're everywhere. Trust me.

12:51.167 --> 12:52.458
We need to help each other.

12:55.417 --> 12:56.792
You want me to undress, huh?

13:18.750 --> 13:19.583
Here.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.083
All your money's there.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.792
We're not thieves.

13:26.882 --> 13:28.217
Stop standing around, boys.

13:40.095 --> 13:43.230
About what Angeli said...

13:43.232 --> 13:45.134
- Food and a bed right?
- Yeah.

13:47.403 --> 13:48.837
And about that?

13:50.507 --> 13:52.272
Bed's down here.

13:52.274 --> 13:54.308
The rest we can take
care of in the morning.

13:54.310 --> 13:59.014
Uh, I was thinking, if you could
just lend me some warm clothes.

14:00.282 --> 14:01.649
I'll pay for it.

14:03.118 --> 14:04.487
And you can keep
the rest of the money.

14:06.155 --> 14:08.155
You know, it's suicide, man,

14:08.157 --> 14:10.125
if you go outside
this time of night.

14:11.026 --> 14:14.063
No, no, no, no,
decide in the morning.

14:15.197 --> 14:18.031
And if you want to cancel
the deal and leave tomorrow,

14:18.033 --> 14:20.169
I'll throw in a new set
of clothes for free.

14:20.969 --> 14:24.037
But really,
I'd rather leave tonight

14:24.039 --> 14:25.407
if that's still okay with you.

14:31.213 --> 14:32.281
This is your room.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.148
It's not necessary, sir.

14:35.150 --> 14:37.019
Now listen
very carefully.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.021
I didn't want to bring you here.

14:40.055 --> 14:42.191
In that fucking cabin,
you asked to come.

14:43.425 --> 14:44.925
You insisted on coming.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.261
No, you pleaded.

14:46.629 --> 14:48.130
You begged to come.

14:48.598 --> 14:49.499
And now you want to leave?

14:50.700 --> 14:51.467
Fair enough.

14:52.602 --> 14:53.402
Leave.

14:55.705 --> 14:57.037
Go!

14:57.039 --> 14:58.472
But go as you are.

14:58.474 --> 15:00.543
Freeze to death, or get shot.

15:09.184 --> 15:10.352
Everything you need is inside.

16:16.251 --> 16:17.119
So...

16:18.588 --> 16:20.055
why are you here?

16:20.422 --> 16:23.058
- To take over.
- Take over what?

16:28.096 --> 16:31.097
This. I know it's not legal.

16:31.099 --> 16:32.602
But it ain't exactly
illegal either.

16:47.484 --> 16:48.383
You know...

16:50.285 --> 16:51.754
when I first left my country...

16:54.223 --> 16:55.457
it was to go to yours.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.028
And I did things.

17:02.364 --> 17:03.398
I made choices.

17:05.635 --> 17:07.570
choices I could never take back.

17:08.605 --> 17:12.474
And this moment reminds me
of one of those choices.

17:14.376 --> 17:15.177
Choices?

17:16.746 --> 17:18.613
You can trust me, sir.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.544
Oh, by the way...

17:48.645 --> 17:50.078
I'll tell you if I trust you,

17:51.346 --> 17:52.347
not the other way around.

19:07.490 --> 19:08.791
Who built all this?

19:10.192 --> 19:11.159
Does it matter?

20:34.777 --> 20:35.712
Look.

20:36.846 --> 20:37.980
That's what we do.

20:40.049 --> 20:41.383
Just look, boy.

21:40.543 --> 21:41.409
Clean this up.

21:44.346 --> 21:44.914
What?

21:45.948 --> 21:46.949
Take over.

21:47.617 --> 21:48.885
Start by cleaning this up.

22:01.497 --> 22:04.901
Oh, and if it calls out,
just ignore it.

22:32.895 --> 22:34.628
Oh, don't worry, J.C..

22:34.630 --> 22:35.665
Don't worry, boy.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.431
It just likes
fucking with people.

22:41.637 --> 22:42.705
Oh, what's happening?

22:45.041 --> 22:46.642
You clean this up as well.

22:47.043 --> 22:48.776
But don't use water!

22:48.778 --> 22:50.746
We have chemicals
at the back for this place.

23:32.822 --> 23:35.858
Shh, shh, shh.

23:37.126 --> 23:38.160
Okay, are you okay?

23:40.696 --> 23:41.797
Are you okay?

23:43.666 --> 23:44.667
Then one more thing.

23:45.935 --> 23:46.869
Whatever you do,

23:47.737 --> 23:48.771
no matter what,

23:49.772 --> 23:52.474
never bring a woman
into this room.

23:54.210 --> 23:55.011
Ever.

25:11.250 --> 25:13.792
Samuel. What did you promise mama?

25:14.625 --> 25:19.331
I told you no TV during school days.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.831
I don't like it when you misbehave.

25:21.833 --> 25:23.125
Is Doctor Carl there?

25:24.208 --> 25:26.125
Son, give the phone to him.

25:27.125 --> 25:29.917
Doctor Carl, can you hear me?

25:30.542 --> 25:32.250
The signal is terrible out here.

25:33.250 --> 25:34.083
Doctor?

25:34.583 --> 25:37.623
I've double checked with the bank.
It was deposited the other day.

25:37.625 --> 25:40.792
Can we schedule Samuel's operation?

25:41.583 --> 25:43.625
Huh? Hello? Doctor?

25:44.875 --> 25:46.915
Doctor? Hello?

25:46.917 --> 25:50.375
Just get it done!

25:51.027 --> 25:51.827
Hello?

25:53.458 --> 25:54.292
Fuck.

25:55.833 --> 25:56.667
Miss?

25:57.208 --> 26:01.167
Miss, you can't be here.
You have to leave.

26:02.667 --> 26:03.500
Apologies.

26:06.108 --> 26:07.009
Angeli?

26:07.208 --> 26:08.667
My papers are in order.

26:09.250 --> 26:11.165
- Who are you?
- J.C..

26:11.167 --> 26:12.456
Are you lost?

26:12.458 --> 26:14.206
Me? Lost?

26:14.208 --> 26:16.456
You're trespassing. Please leave.

26:16.458 --> 26:17.667
Do you work here?

26:18.750 --> 26:21.956
My father and I own it.
But we're closed now.

26:21.958 --> 26:25.373
You fucking kidding?
The old man has a Filipino son?

26:25.375 --> 26:27.248
I thought there was no cellphone signal.

26:27.250 --> 26:28.458
Now you know the spot!

26:28.917 --> 26:31.000
Does he pay you?

26:31.625 --> 26:32.540
Who?

26:32.542 --> 26:34.165
Your asshole father.

26:34.167 --> 26:35.417
He always pays late.

26:36.167 --> 26:38.000
I suppose you know about the town council?

26:39.917 --> 26:40.750
I guess not.

26:43.679 --> 26:44.346
Hey!

26:46.882 --> 26:49.750
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

26:49.752 --> 26:51.720
- I said tonight.
- Yeah, I... can we talk?

26:54.824 --> 26:55.958
Talk fast.

26:57.059 --> 26:59.359
- I need an advance.
- You get paid after delivery.

26:59.361 --> 27:02.362
I know, but...
it's an emergency.

27:02.364 --> 27:04.600
You'll get paid tonight,
after delivery.

27:05.034 --> 27:08.068
I know, but I'm already
good for three tonight.

27:08.070 --> 27:10.704
- It's good as delivered.
- No, it's not.

27:10.706 --> 27:12.842
- And the deal was four.
- Yeah...

27:13.776 --> 27:16.045
but the fourth one got
picked up by someone else.

27:17.346 --> 27:19.648
Now what if that
someone else was me?

27:23.018 --> 27:25.385
I'm not paying you to do
your job for you, Angeli.

27:25.387 --> 27:27.756
Okay, look, look, look,
that was my mistake.

27:29.692 --> 27:32.294
I didn't know he was going to
go for the border on his own.

27:32.895 --> 27:35.164
I just need some money wired
before the banks close.

27:37.399 --> 27:39.001
I'm sorry I have to ask you,

27:40.002 --> 27:41.070
and I never asked before.

27:43.706 --> 27:45.307
I just really,
really need the money.

27:48.210 --> 27:49.044
Please.

27:57.920 --> 27:58.821
Oh.

28:03.192 --> 28:04.026
Wait.

28:05.161 --> 28:06.860
This is, this is half.

28:09.999 --> 28:11.901
What are you
waiting for? Get in the car!

29:06.789 --> 29:07.823
Where are you going?

29:11.126 --> 29:12.261
Get in the other way, son.

29:14.208 --> 29:15.083
This is it.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.667
This is the moment I've been waiting for.

29:20.708 --> 29:22.542
He called me son.

29:23.958 --> 29:24.792
His blood.

29:27.792 --> 29:29.458
But what happened after,

29:30.583 --> 29:32.145
I can't explain.

29:53.503 --> 29:54.803
- Hello?
- Hello?

29:56.472 --> 29:58.105
Hello, we need help here!

30:02.077 --> 30:04.146
Help! Someone!

30:34.875 --> 30:36.750
You've been out for a day.

30:39.667 --> 30:41.081
Sorry about that.

30:41.083 --> 30:41.917
You needed warmth.

30:44.250 --> 30:45.167
Thank you.

30:46.625 --> 30:48.708
J.C., the three men are here.

30:49.875 --> 30:51.958
One of them might be a little difficult.

30:54.417 --> 30:55.500
What happens next?

30:56.167 --> 30:59.667
First, you pay me the other
half your father owes.

31:00.875 --> 31:02.292
I don't have your money.

31:04.833 --> 31:06.667
Stop playing games, J.C..

31:07.792 --> 31:10.208
All the money's with Father.

31:11.667 --> 31:13.250
Where is he?

31:15.458 --> 31:17.000
I don't want to be a part of this.

31:20.167 --> 31:21.750
J.C., I need the money.

31:23.125 --> 31:24.250
My son needs it.

31:25.417 --> 31:28.750
Do what you must with the three men
but I need to be paid.

31:30.292 --> 31:32.042
I've done my part, right?

31:33.625 --> 31:34.669
Right?

31:38.625 --> 31:39.792
They need to leave.

31:41.458 --> 31:42.958
If you tell the three men to leave,

31:43.542 --> 31:46.042
the Town Council will find out.

31:48.333 --> 31:50.083
They'll come here and pick you up.

31:53.083 --> 31:57.583
Both of us will be in trouble
if you let the three go.

32:02.583 --> 32:04.000
I'm not a killer.

32:17.045 --> 32:19.281
Aha! You're alive!

32:20.282 --> 32:22.082
That's a relief.

32:22.084 --> 32:24.119
A dead host would be
bad news for all of us.

32:26.288 --> 32:27.423
Especially you.

32:27.990 --> 32:28.991
I'm alive enough.

32:29.726 --> 32:31.594
- You are?
- I'm Don.

32:33.262 --> 32:34.229
The accountant.

32:36.165 --> 32:38.300
Let me introduce
you to the others.

32:39.101 --> 32:41.203
That is Bront, the musician.

32:41.571 --> 32:45.338
And that is Sami,
the insurance agent.

32:45.340 --> 32:47.307
What are you talking about?

32:47.309 --> 32:50.711
Well, former accountant
to be exact.

32:50.713 --> 32:53.182
The new law made us
all former somethings, right?

32:53.750 --> 32:55.652
Just put that in our
new Black ID card.

32:58.053 --> 32:59.054
The one we bought from you?

33:01.089 --> 33:03.225
Black IDs, of course!

33:03.726 --> 33:05.358
Right.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.227
J.C., you must thank
this lady here, you know?

33:07.229 --> 33:09.064
She saved your life.

33:09.431 --> 33:11.431
We had this idea to put
you in a hot bath

33:11.433 --> 33:13.701
to get you warmed up,
but she said no because...

33:13.703 --> 33:16.102
Because you would
have gone into shock,

33:16.104 --> 33:17.473
and that would have killed you.

33:19.441 --> 33:21.744
Or I will, if you don't
give us what we've paid for.

33:23.378 --> 33:24.581
So listen, J.C....

33:26.415 --> 33:28.585
Is there any chance
we could get something to eat?

33:45.835 --> 33:46.636
Really?

33:48.270 --> 33:49.037
This is it?

33:51.574 --> 33:53.708
My father went out
for more supplies.

33:53.710 --> 33:55.512
We just got separated
during the storm.

33:57.145 --> 33:58.515
So you think
your father's still alive?

34:01.818 --> 34:03.450
Because she said

34:03.452 --> 34:06.589
that you said
he was hurt real bad.

34:10.425 --> 34:11.494
Yeah, he's okay!

34:12.495 --> 34:15.195
Our cars just got
separated during the storm.

34:15.197 --> 34:16.766
You know,
can't see anything out there.

34:21.303 --> 34:22.639
As you know, J.C.,

34:23.540 --> 34:26.308
it's very difficult for us
to get into this country.

34:29.579 --> 34:32.080
I still remember that
smell of the boat,

34:32.782 --> 34:35.384
that small boat packed
with 50 people,

34:36.719 --> 34:39.221
children, fathers, mothers.

34:41.423 --> 34:43.560
We were floating
around for two months.

34:46.194 --> 34:47.728
There's this one guy,

34:47.730 --> 34:49.630
always complaining

34:49.632 --> 34:51.366
about the heat,
about that damn smell.

34:53.468 --> 34:56.071
He once even said,
"I'd rather die than continue."

35:00.843 --> 35:03.245
One night, there was a storm,

35:04.379 --> 35:05.180
hit us hard.

35:06.916 --> 35:09.284
Many of us ended up in
the water, including him.

35:12.421 --> 35:14.589
Many of them made it
back to the boat,

35:14.591 --> 35:15.357
but not him.

35:17.594 --> 35:18.561
I saw him in the water...

35:20.362 --> 35:22.230
trying to swim at first,

35:23.533 --> 35:24.734
but gave up at the end.

35:25.835 --> 35:29.438
J.C., I don't want to be
that guy who stops swimming.

35:30.405 --> 35:31.340
That's why we prepare.

35:33.342 --> 35:35.876
We sacrificed everything
we've earned in this country

35:35.878 --> 35:37.379
for your father's services.

35:42.250 --> 35:44.186
And this is what we get?

35:44.787 --> 35:46.154
I don't think this is enough.

35:47.657 --> 35:50.290
Don, usually my father...

35:50.292 --> 35:53.728
Don, he'll be back soon
with food, with your documents.

35:53.730 --> 35:55.832
- Just, just relax.
- Oh, will he?

35:56.465 --> 35:59.533
Because he told me, we need
to get out to get the food.

35:59.535 --> 36:01.669
I'm a little confused now here.

36:01.671 --> 36:04.639
- Are we going to get the food?
- Don, you'll get what you paid for.

36:04.641 --> 36:06.540
Does anything else matter?

36:06.542 --> 36:09.479
You tell me.
I also remember paying for beds.

36:10.613 --> 36:13.883
Look at us,
sleeping on floors and tables.

36:16.819 --> 36:19.219
Where are the rooms
in this place?

36:19.221 --> 36:21.789
Every room down that
floor and hall is locked.

36:21.791 --> 36:22.725
I've already checked.

36:24.560 --> 36:27.595
Yeah, about that, there is
just some problems below.

36:27.597 --> 36:30.931
Only a few rooms are working, but,
yeah, I will take care of that.

36:30.933 --> 36:33.803
Hey, buddy, we're going to
need one of those rooms.

36:34.336 --> 36:36.971
- Please, J.C.?
- Yeah, you two are my guests.

36:36.973 --> 36:38.906
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you.

36:38.908 --> 36:39.776
What about us?

36:46.292 --> 36:47.917
A snowstorm this bad,

36:48.792 --> 36:50.292
there was no way for me to leave.

36:52.042 --> 36:53.417
Where would I go anyway?

36:55.042 --> 36:56.125
Angeli's right.

36:56.958 --> 36:58.625
These men will die.

37:00.542 --> 37:01.583
What do I do?

37:03.625 --> 37:06.875
What would Father do
if he were here in my place?

37:09.000 --> 37:10.208
Father.

37:14.744 --> 37:16.479
Don't slow down, son.
Don't slow down.

37:17.345 --> 37:18.815
The storm's getting in
early and strong.

37:20.049 --> 37:21.484
We can't be stranded out here.

37:23.486 --> 37:24.620
Last night.

37:26.055 --> 37:27.690
Yeah? What about last night?

37:30.292 --> 37:32.893
- A man got torn to pieces.
- Don't slow down, don't slow!

37:32.895 --> 37:34.329
Something killed him.

37:36.833 --> 37:37.633
No.

37:39.936 --> 37:40.703
You killed him.

37:43.005 --> 37:44.507
But I was with you
the whole time.

37:45.041 --> 37:47.373
- You killed someone.
- So did you.

37:47.375 --> 37:49.643
That's not true.

37:49.645 --> 37:51.344
Don't you pity him, son.

37:51.346 --> 37:53.583
He would've ripped you to
pieces to get across the border.

37:54.083 --> 37:55.685
Now listen very closely.

37:56.451 --> 37:58.418
Don't slow down, son!
Don't slow down, I tell you.

37:58.420 --> 38:01.289
You only exist if you're
useful to people in charge.

38:01.758 --> 38:04.457
This whole immigration issue they
keep on talking about day after day,

38:04.459 --> 38:05.895
well, it's not my problem,

38:06.529 --> 38:10.396
until someone pays me to make
it my problem, understand?

38:10.398 --> 38:12.332
You and me, boy, you and me,

38:12.334 --> 38:13.703
we provide them this service.

38:17.640 --> 38:18.875
Take this.

38:20.342 --> 38:23.411
Yes, I know, you need to be cruel in
this world if you want to survive.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.915
- Take it.
- No, I don't want this.

38:28.084 --> 38:30.718
- Take it!
- No, I don't want to be a part of this!

38:30.720 --> 38:33.455
You're fucking, fucking,
fucking ungrateful!

38:33.890 --> 38:36.058
Don't you understand
what I'm offering you?

38:36.893 --> 38:38.661
Someone might control this land,

38:39.061 --> 38:40.828
the gates, the borders.

38:40.830 --> 38:42.832
But in that motel, I'm God!

38:43.800 --> 38:45.501
I am God!

39:12.895 --> 39:16.364
Sir? Sir? Sir?

39:17.465 --> 39:19.101
Sir, are you okay, sir?

40:01.677 --> 40:03.479
Stop, James, stop!

40:04.146 --> 40:06.048
Stop!

40:09.185 --> 40:10.953
Please, please. Don't go.

40:25.708 --> 40:26.917
I won't do anything.

40:27.583 --> 40:29.000
I won't hurt anyone.

40:30.333 --> 40:31.750
I won't kill anyone.

40:33.958 --> 40:35.833
All I need is to buy a little time.

40:37.333 --> 40:38.292
Time.

40:44.987 --> 40:46.620
Are you sure we should do this?

40:46.622 --> 40:48.956
Yeah, yeah, I'm telling you,

40:48.958 --> 40:50.726
my guy can make anything work.

40:53.863 --> 40:56.866
We just need to get that card
to him before he leaves town.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.168
Once we change
that ID to yours...

41:01.704 --> 41:03.904
you're a ghost.
No one will bother you.

41:03.906 --> 41:05.940
But we're so close
to getting across.

41:05.942 --> 41:07.576
Can't we just stick to the plan?

41:08.110 --> 41:09.011
The plan?

41:15.551 --> 41:18.054
- How is any of this the plan?
- What do you mean?

41:18.688 --> 41:21.722
- You made me stop the car.
- That's not fair.

41:21.724 --> 41:24.226
We both agreed he would have
died if we left him there.

41:24.860 --> 41:27.663
Okay, but you know that
I can't cross the border.

41:28.898 --> 41:30.998
<i>That card is a chance for us...</i>

41:33.803 --> 41:35.936
This is not enough to
bribe the patrol guards

41:35.938 --> 41:37.304
for the three of us.

41:37.306 --> 41:40.808
You told us that
the papers will come through,

41:40.810 --> 41:42.778
papers and ID cards.

41:43.212 --> 41:44.278
We have none of those.

41:44.280 --> 41:45.980
Yes, I understand.

41:45.982 --> 41:47.783
But the fucker who runs
this place is missing.

41:49.085 --> 41:50.987
We're so close, man.

41:52.888 --> 41:55.791
Our children are waiting for us.

41:56.859 --> 42:00.995
You know, we appreciate
what you've done for us,

42:00.997 --> 42:02.631
getting us this far.

42:03.099 --> 42:05.099
But maybe it's different
with you, because...

42:05.101 --> 42:05.935
Because?

42:06.702 --> 42:07.503
What?

42:08.804 --> 42:10.239
You guys have
families and I don't?

42:11.941 --> 42:13.674
So I'm not as
motivated to get out?

42:13.676 --> 42:15.878
Please understand him, Don.

42:16.245 --> 42:18.781
You know why we've
all are tried to get across.

42:19.882 --> 42:22.651
<i>But that lady, Angeli,
she knows something.</i>

42:30.092 --> 42:32.593
<i>What if J.C.'s
telling the truth?</i>

42:32.595 --> 42:36.163
<i>All we know is what Angeli told
us, and they took our money.</i>

42:36.165 --> 42:38.200
<i>She could have been lying
since the very beginning.</i>

42:44.640 --> 42:45.708
<i>I don't believe either of them,</i>

42:46.809 --> 42:48.010
<i>but we have to be patient.</i>

42:58.020 --> 43:00.089
Angeli! Angeli!

43:01.390 --> 43:03.706
Angeli!

43:03.708 --> 43:04.998
What are you doing here?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.125
Open the door, J.C..

43:07.583 --> 43:09.750
- Open it.
- I can't.

43:10.292 --> 43:13.331
- I said open it.
- Be quiet.

43:13.333 --> 43:17.875
If you don't, I'll tell the others
you've been hoarding food.

43:18.667 --> 43:19.750
That's not true.

43:20.292 --> 43:21.958
Do you think they'll believe you?

43:22.667 --> 43:25.375
I'll say you've been playing them
this whole time.

43:26.417 --> 43:30.456
You'll have to open this to
prove to them you're not lying.

43:30.458 --> 43:32.792
But if you show me what's inside...

43:34.583 --> 43:36.083
we won't have any problems.

43:41.667 --> 43:42.792
Open the door.

44:11.667 --> 44:14.125
If you close it, I'll shout.

44:18.083 --> 44:19.167
There's no food here.

44:20.750 --> 44:22.000
What are you looking for?

44:22.667 --> 44:23.792
The money you owe me.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.125
Money my father owes you.

44:27.125 --> 44:29.540
Your father's not here.
So it's now your debt.

44:29.542 --> 44:30.625
Stop arguing.

44:33.215 --> 44:35.215
- Cathy, where are you going?
- That's it!

44:35.217 --> 44:37.253
- That's the sound I've been hearing!
- Wait a second!

44:40.055 --> 44:43.157
Guys,
you're not allowed in here.

44:43.159 --> 44:45.227
Why? What about her?

44:46.729 --> 44:47.363
Nothing.

44:50.032 --> 44:51.367
There's nothing valuable here.

44:52.902 --> 44:54.069
That's right.

44:55.371 --> 44:57.070
Your room's next door,
let's go!

44:57.072 --> 44:59.039
What is it with you
and these rooms?

45:03.145 --> 45:04.914
Look around, man,
there's no one here.

45:06.949 --> 45:08.849
- Cathy, stop!
- Hey! Hey! Don't touch her!

45:08.851 --> 45:12.119
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
This room needs... this room is infested.

45:12.121 --> 45:13.921
- Infested, with what, bugs?
- Yes, yeah, yes.

45:13.923 --> 45:15.490
- I don't see any bugs around here.
- No, no, no, Cathy!

45:15.492 --> 45:17.191
- Cathy, don't...
- Hey! What are you doing?

45:17.193 --> 45:19.929
- No, you don't understand.
- Understand what?

45:20.462 --> 45:22.131
We saved your fucking life.

45:22.499 --> 45:24.164
Least you can do
is get us some food.

45:24.166 --> 45:25.232
No, no, wait!

45:44.787 --> 45:45.854
It's gone.

45:47.423 --> 45:50.125
- What's gone?
- The sound's gone.

45:52.094 --> 45:52.962
What do you mean?

47:59.000 --> 48:00.625
All I needed to tame the beast...

48:02.750 --> 48:04.417
was to become my father.

48:09.875 --> 48:10.958
Then I wasn't afraid.

49:05.333 --> 49:09.167
Mother was right. I am my father's son.

49:10.917 --> 49:11.750
I can do this.

49:13.375 --> 49:14.417
I will make it out alive.

49:42.592 --> 49:43.358
We're leaving!

49:44.727 --> 49:45.793
We want our money back.

49:45.795 --> 49:47.160
Leaving?

49:47.162 --> 49:48.397
Where do you plan to go?

49:49.198 --> 49:50.598
We'd rather take our
chances with immigration

49:50.600 --> 49:52.201
than starve to death here.

49:52.669 --> 49:54.637
Look, guys,
my father is almost back.

49:55.270 --> 49:57.270
Just wait a little longer.
No one's a prisoner.

49:57.272 --> 49:58.140
We leave now!

49:59.576 --> 50:00.808
The refund.

50:00.810 --> 50:02.510
Look, Don,
I don't have your money.

50:02.512 --> 50:04.812
You don't have the money?
Where do you keep it?

50:04.814 --> 50:07.715
The motel safe?
No key again, right?

50:07.717 --> 50:09.784
We take the whole safe!
Give us our money back!

50:09.786 --> 50:11.521
Hey, hey, calm down!

50:11.750 --> 50:15.956
If they leave, the town council
will come after us. It's on us.

50:15.958 --> 50:18.000
Not on me. It's on you and Father.

50:18.460 --> 50:21.063
Hey, a little respect
for your guests, please.

50:22.064 --> 50:23.465
Hey, Sami, Don!

50:33.776 --> 50:35.010
Cathy!

50:48.758 --> 50:49.358
You see that?

50:50.693 --> 50:51.694
- It moved!
- Shh.

50:53.763 --> 50:55.430
It hurts so much.

50:56.799 --> 50:59.101
The water makes it
a little better.

51:00.637 --> 51:03.506
Cathy? Cathy, you need to
get out of the pool now.

51:04.507 --> 51:05.340
Come here.

51:07.342 --> 51:08.277
What do you mean?

51:09.444 --> 51:11.446
We have everything we need.

51:13.550 --> 51:17.485
Except James, where is he?

51:17.487 --> 51:18.555
Cathy.

51:19.522 --> 51:21.591
Come here.
We need to get you to a doctor.

51:22.157 --> 51:23.158
Come here.

51:30.399 --> 51:32.633
- J.C.!
- Come here!

51:32.635 --> 51:33.868
- We need to get this out!
- Come here! Get her!

51:33.870 --> 51:35.368
Oh my god.

51:35.370 --> 51:36.506
Don't let it kill me!

51:37.607 --> 51:38.906
Get it out!

51:38.908 --> 51:41.374
- Get it out!
- Careful! Careful!

51:41.376 --> 51:43.176
Get it out of me!

51:44.446 --> 51:47.280
Get it out of me! Get it out!

51:47.282 --> 51:49.182
Lay her down!
Lay her down here!

51:49.184 --> 51:50.818
Shit, What the hell's
inside her?

51:50.820 --> 51:53.590
Get it out! Get it out!

51:57.708 --> 51:59.248
What are you doing?

51:59.250 --> 52:01.040
It's killing her.

52:01.042 --> 52:02.583
She's just in labor.

52:03.398 --> 52:05.165
- No, no, okay.
- No!

52:05.167 --> 52:07.434
- Hold her, hold her hand!
- Get it out!

52:07.436 --> 52:10.805
- J.C.!
- Get it out, cut it out! Cut it out!

52:10.807 --> 52:13.206
- Cut it out!
- I can't do it!

52:13.208 --> 52:14.542
Give it to me!

52:16.579 --> 52:18.648
No, no, no, no!

52:34.897 --> 52:36.198
Kill it, J.C.!

52:38.266 --> 52:40.233
Kill it, J.C.! Kill it!

52:48.243 --> 52:49.610
Oh my God.

53:25.447 --> 53:27.748
You okay?

53:31.821 --> 53:33.556
- Get him up!
- Let's get him out of here.

53:48.125 --> 53:49.036
What's going on?

53:49.038 --> 53:50.907
J.C., what happened?

53:53.042 --> 53:53.876
Hey.

53:59.749 --> 54:01.949
We got to let the storm pass.
It's impossible to drive.

54:01.951 --> 54:04.587
- You won't be able to see anything.
- Hey! Stop that.

54:05.655 --> 54:06.656
Bront needs help.

54:07.623 --> 54:08.491
We have to try.

54:35.952 --> 54:36.919
Hey, J.C.!

54:45.495 --> 54:48.631
- What's going on?
- This door has been opened recently.

54:51.100 --> 54:52.267
Maybe it was James.

54:58.040 --> 54:59.474
Do you have Cathy's key?

55:02.410 --> 55:03.278
Okay, let's go.

55:20.830 --> 55:21.731
Who did this?

55:22.899 --> 55:24.565
I don't know.

55:24.567 --> 55:26.769
Ah! Jesus, are you trying
to stop us from leaving?

55:27.435 --> 55:28.638
This house
is welded shut!

55:29.505 --> 55:31.404
Angeli set us up!

55:31.406 --> 55:33.406
- It's her!
- Check on her car!

55:33.408 --> 55:35.077
No, no, no, no, no!
She wouldn't do this.

55:37.480 --> 55:39.980
There's no food.
There's no money.

55:39.982 --> 55:41.449
There's no fucking signal!

55:44.554 --> 55:46.055
Is there anywhere with signal?

55:48.791 --> 55:49.892
It's an hour away!

55:53.696 --> 55:54.964
<i>I know what you did.</i>

55:55.665 --> 55:57.798
You slashed Cathy's tires.

55:57.800 --> 56:00.100
- What are you talking about?
- So you're now the most important person here.

56:00.102 --> 56:02.402
I've been in here
the whole time.

56:02.404 --> 56:05.405
Angeli, I just want to make sure that
nobody leaves behind with that thing!

56:05.407 --> 56:06.640
You're not touching my car!

56:26.662 --> 56:28.796
- I know where your papers are.
- Where?

56:28.798 --> 56:31.098
It's in the locked room
below with all our money.

56:31.100 --> 56:33.433
- She's lying!
- We all just want to leave here

56:33.435 --> 56:35.137
with what we were
promised, J.C..

56:35.139 --> 56:36.375
Are you betraying me?

56:36.739 --> 56:38.975
So make him open that door,
and I will drive us all out of here.

56:42.478 --> 56:44.379
Sami, keep an eye
on Bront and the girl.

56:44.847 --> 56:45.615
Let's go.

56:46.649 --> 56:47.650
Protect her?

56:48.584 --> 56:50.753
She fucking gave
birth to a monster!

56:51.621 --> 56:53.421
I meant protect Bront from her!

57:21.250 --> 57:22.167
Can you hear it?

57:23.542 --> 57:24.375
Hear what?

57:27.333 --> 57:28.833
That sound.

57:29.833 --> 57:33.193
I can't hear anything. What is it?

57:36.458 --> 57:37.498
Shut up!

57:40.750 --> 57:42.083
Are you okay?

57:46.542 --> 57:47.143
Hey.

58:09.667 --> 58:10.792
What the hell was that?

58:44.333 --> 58:45.267
Sami?

59:58.841 --> 59:59.775
It's here.

1:00:01.710 --> 1:00:03.813
James, you in there?

1:00:04.413 --> 1:00:06.182
It's jammed.

1:00:06.849 --> 1:00:08.284
- Let's kick it, then.
- No, wait.

1:00:10.352 --> 1:00:13.189
Hey, stop your lies and open it.

1:00:13.756 --> 1:00:15.057
Open the door, J.C..

1:00:15.925 --> 1:00:18.094
Don! Bront!

1:00:20.996 --> 1:00:21.864
Sami.

1:00:47.790 --> 1:00:50.192
- Are you okay?
- Cathy, what happened?

1:00:50.926 --> 1:00:53.060
I don't... I don't know.

1:00:53.062 --> 1:00:54.396
I... I woke up...

1:00:58.267 --> 1:00:59.335
I don't know.

1:01:00.169 --> 1:01:01.036
Where is Sami?

1:01:46.916 --> 1:01:47.716
Sami!

1:01:51.921 --> 1:01:53.022
You took your time.

1:02:09.305 --> 1:02:10.439
Angeli?

1:02:15.545 --> 1:02:18.047
She knows something.
She's responsible.

1:02:19.848 --> 1:02:23.919
Goodbye, my... my brother.

1:02:34.964 --> 1:02:35.898
Sami...

1:02:43.167 --> 1:02:44.542
What are you doing, Angeli?

1:02:48.917 --> 1:02:50.333
It's innocent.

1:02:51.347 --> 1:02:52.515
Why isn't it attacking you?

1:02:55.583 --> 1:02:57.000
It's innocent, J.C..

1:02:58.375 --> 1:03:00.208
It killed two people.

1:03:00.856 --> 1:03:02.358
Come on,
just throw the fucking thing in!

1:03:04.159 --> 1:03:05.425
J.C.?

1:03:13.570 --> 1:03:14.470
Angeli.

1:03:15.458 --> 1:03:16.500
Listen to me.

1:03:18.458 --> 1:03:19.833
We need to help each other.

1:03:23.458 --> 1:03:25.500
What you're holding is dangerous.

1:03:28.333 --> 1:03:30.125
I don't want you to get hurt.

1:03:31.833 --> 1:03:33.833
I can feel its pain.

1:03:35.917 --> 1:03:37.042
It's just afraid.

1:03:38.250 --> 1:03:40.625
It didn't mean to kill them.

1:03:41.196 --> 1:03:42.164
Angeli.

1:03:44.708 --> 1:03:46.833
You need to throw it in, otherwise...

1:03:47.583 --> 1:03:49.250
It'll attack us too.

1:03:53.500 --> 1:03:55.042
I can't.

1:03:56.125 --> 1:03:57.540
- Do it.
- I can't.

1:03:57.542 --> 1:03:58.542
Do it!

1:04:00.458 --> 1:04:01.292
Do it!

1:04:05.333 --> 1:04:06.453
J.C., please don't!

1:04:21.904 --> 1:04:23.205
I don't want to die here.

1:04:31.447 --> 1:04:34.016
Bront and Sami,
they never hurt you!

1:04:35.184 --> 1:04:36.350
Now, give me the keys!

1:04:36.352 --> 1:04:38.251
I just... I... I can't do that.

1:04:38.253 --> 1:04:40.320
- Where are the keys?
- I just can't do that!

1:04:45.327 --> 1:04:46.395
No, no, no, don't!

1:04:47.296 --> 1:04:48.563
Give me the keys!

1:04:48.565 --> 1:04:50.633
- J.C., please.
- Stop, please, please!

1:04:51.300 --> 1:04:53.100
Don, what are you doing?

1:04:53.102 --> 1:04:54.069
This is her choice.

1:05:04.647 --> 1:05:05.948
Don, it was me.

1:05:08.518 --> 1:05:09.885
It was me.

1:05:10.986 --> 1:05:13.288
The town council pays me
for every immigrant killed.

1:05:13.723 --> 1:05:14.990
Angeli knew nothing about this.

1:05:18.260 --> 1:05:19.194
Stop!

1:05:34.376 --> 1:05:36.979
Don, Don,
I can get you the food!

1:05:41.049 --> 1:05:42.517
I don't care about the food!

1:05:42.519 --> 1:05:44.184
Or about the papers!

1:05:44.186 --> 1:05:46.286
I don't care about the money!
Just give...

1:06:19.556 --> 1:06:21.056
Are you ready
to leave now, Don?

1:06:22.257 --> 1:06:23.058
J.C.!

1:06:26.083 --> 1:06:27.208
Angeli! Lock the door!

1:06:35.304 --> 1:06:37.707
Hey, open the door!
Open the door!

1:07:13.042 --> 1:07:14.042
The beast is on my side.

1:07:15.458 --> 1:07:16.500
I am in control.

1:07:33.796 --> 1:07:36.363
<i>Calm down, Don, please?</i>

1:07:36.365 --> 1:07:37.534
Open the door.

1:07:38.233 --> 1:07:39.602
<i>Don, I need you to relax.</i>

1:07:40.269 --> 1:07:42.037
<i>We can make it out in one piece.</i>

1:07:42.404 --> 1:07:44.206
Whatever that thing is,

1:07:44.641 --> 1:07:47.042
I think we should just stay
clear of the green moss.

1:07:48.845 --> 1:07:49.679
Moss?

1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:52.214
You're fucked up!

1:07:53.215 --> 1:07:55.250
You, your father...

1:07:56.351 --> 1:07:59.354
Angeli, you're all fucked up!

1:07:59.789 --> 1:08:01.491
Don, I'm trying to help you.

1:08:02.592 --> 1:08:04.761
<i>If you want to get out
of here, listen to me.</i>

1:08:05.662 --> 1:08:08.261
<i>Put the knife down
and follow the video.</i>

1:08:08.263 --> 1:08:10.230
I'm not your toy!

1:08:10.232 --> 1:08:13.168
<i>Don, I need proof that
we can trust you.</i>

1:08:13.603 --> 1:08:15.672
You can't come along if
you don't listen to orders.

1:08:16.238 --> 1:08:18.741
You're welcome to stay
here and starve...

1:08:20.208 --> 1:08:21.176
or be eaten.

1:10:29.739 --> 1:10:33.308
It was for us,
for emergency, just in case.

1:10:48.591 --> 1:10:50.057
So you've been watching us
the whole time?

1:10:50.059 --> 1:10:51.859
No, of course not.

1:10:51.861 --> 1:10:53.426
Did you do something to James?

1:10:53.428 --> 1:10:55.430
What? What are
you talking about?

1:10:56.331 --> 1:10:59.867
You know, Cathy,
I saw footprints outside.

1:10:59.869 --> 1:11:01.602
I think he left to get help.

1:11:01.604 --> 1:11:02.903
- You were there.
- To help you.

1:11:02.905 --> 1:11:04.404
- I remember, you were there!
- Cathy,

1:11:04.406 --> 1:11:05.940
you've lost a lot of blood.

1:11:05.942 --> 1:11:07.742
- How did I wake up in that other room?
- It's okay.

1:11:07.744 --> 1:11:09.409
- You've been through a lot.
- Where's James?

1:11:09.411 --> 1:11:10.913
- Where is he?
- J.C.!

1:11:16.018 --> 1:11:17.419
We have
to be quiet.

1:11:20.322 --> 1:11:22.523
- For how long?
- We wait it out here.

1:11:22.525 --> 1:11:24.992
We have food, he doesn't.
We can survive.

1:11:24.994 --> 1:11:27.528
What if he goes out
and slashes my tires?

1:11:27.530 --> 1:11:30.097
Stranding himself here?
He's not that stupid.

1:11:30.099 --> 1:11:31.934
I'm not taking that risk!

1:12:24.053 --> 1:12:24.854
Where are the girls?

1:12:26.155 --> 1:12:28.758
Don, relax.

1:12:29.892 --> 1:12:32.660
We have the car keys.
We can head out together.

1:12:32.662 --> 1:12:34.063
"Together."

1:12:35.631 --> 1:12:37.066
Your monster killed
two of my friends.

1:12:38.734 --> 1:12:39.836
You're afraid of me now?

1:12:41.571 --> 1:12:42.970
It's not my monster.

1:12:45.007 --> 1:12:46.676
Don, just put the knife down.

1:12:47.109 --> 1:12:48.477
We can go to the car.

1:12:49.444 --> 1:12:51.178
- We can get help.
- Just stop it, J.C.!

1:12:53.816 --> 1:12:55.383
You already confessed...

1:12:56.052 --> 1:12:57.854
that you're getting paid
to feed us to that thing.

1:13:01.190 --> 1:13:04.594
Don, even if you try to
get across the border...

1:13:06.028 --> 1:13:07.663
who exactly are you
trying to get to?

1:13:09.999 --> 1:13:12.533
You've got no family...

1:13:12.535 --> 1:13:13.336
...no kids.

1:13:14.503 --> 1:13:16.505
You won't be able
to get food in town.

1:13:17.073 --> 1:13:21.510
The people, the cops...
everyone's part of it.

1:13:23.179 --> 1:13:24.945
There's really
nowhere for us to go.

1:13:35.625 --> 1:13:36.424
That's it?

1:13:41.463 --> 1:13:42.897
Do you want to kill me?

1:13:42.899 --> 1:13:43.900
Or do you want to fuck me?

1:14:19.568 --> 1:14:21.068
Stop it, J.C.! Stop it!

1:14:58.874 --> 1:14:59.675
Don...

1:15:01.177 --> 1:15:02.645
Don, I'm so sorry.

1:15:03.746 --> 1:15:04.714
Angeli and I...

1:15:06.082 --> 1:15:07.149
we didn't have a choice.

1:15:23.733 --> 1:15:26.002
The guy who was always
complaining about the heat...

1:15:27.837 --> 1:15:29.038
about the smell.

1:15:31.907 --> 1:15:33.542
The guy who stopped swimming...

1:15:35.344 --> 1:15:36.779
he was my father.

1:16:43.833 --> 1:16:45.208
The battery's too cold.

1:16:46.042 --> 1:16:48.208
- What should we do?
- Wait until it gets warmer.

1:16:50.458 --> 1:16:51.748
Aren't you coming in?

1:16:51.750 --> 1:16:52.750
It's cold.

1:16:53.208 --> 1:16:54.750
I need to call my son.

1:17:02.164 --> 1:17:03.199
Cathy?

1:17:04.033 --> 1:17:05.399
Cathy,
we got to get ready to leave.

1:18:07.208 --> 1:18:08.583
This place is mine.

1:18:09.792 --> 1:18:11.415
You're living in my place.

1:18:11.417 --> 1:18:12.875
Do you understand?

1:18:14.750 --> 1:18:17.042
You are mine. I am your master.

1:18:57.346 --> 1:18:58.147
Angeli?

1:18:58.792 --> 1:18:59.750
He's gone.

1:19:01.167 --> 1:19:02.500
Angeli, get away from the bed.

1:19:02.833 --> 1:19:04.417
My Samuel is gone.

1:19:13.896 --> 1:19:14.497
Angeli?

1:19:17.542 --> 1:19:19.083
We'll go to Samuel.

1:19:22.083 --> 1:19:23.083
The two of us.

1:19:41.375 --> 1:19:43.792
There are things you can't control.

1:19:44.792 --> 1:19:46.500
Creatures you can't tame.

1:19:48.708 --> 1:19:50.264
Monsters you have to destroy.

1:21:27.329 --> 1:21:28.130
Angeli?

1:21:30.958 --> 1:21:35.540
After fighting so hard
to get out of that place,

1:21:35.542 --> 1:21:37.708
now I wish we'd never left.

1:21:41.083 --> 1:21:42.542
My Samuel is gone.

1:21:43.083 --> 1:21:46.000
Everything we went through
was for nothing.

1:21:53.355 --> 1:21:54.624
Give me the knife.
Give me the knife.

1:21:54.917 --> 1:21:56.189
Angeli stop moving!

1:21:56.191 --> 1:21:58.024
- Give me the knife now!
- Don't do this, J.C.!

1:21:58.026 --> 1:21:58.927
Give me the knife!

1:22:00.497 --> 1:22:02.164
No, give me that! Cathy!

1:22:03.298 --> 1:22:04.466
Angeli!

1:22:08.605 --> 1:22:09.998
Angeli!

1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:10.833
Wait!

1:22:28.424 --> 1:22:29.224
Angeli!

1:22:34.229 --> 1:22:35.197
Angeli!

1:22:40.708 --> 1:22:42.083
Angeli, where are you?

1:22:46.008 --> 1:22:46.609
Angeli?

1:22:47.443 --> 1:22:48.444
Angeli!

1:22:51.614 --> 1:22:52.414
Angeli?

1:22:57.958 --> 1:22:59.792
Angeli, we need to get that out!

1:23:43.542 --> 1:23:46.625
We must get it out before it kills you!

1:23:47.542 --> 1:23:49.000
I'm just trying to help you!

1:24:14.250 --> 1:24:15.625
Stay away!

1:24:24.833 --> 1:24:26.000
That day...

1:24:28.458 --> 1:24:30.208
walking to the fire.

1:24:31.375 --> 1:24:33.500
I felt what it felt.

1:24:35.667 --> 1:24:38.500
I felt its pain.

1:24:39.583 --> 1:24:41.708
I felt what it felt.

1:24:45.042 --> 1:24:47.042
But that's what you wanted, right?

1:24:49.042 --> 1:24:50.292
You and your father.

1:24:51.333 --> 1:24:53.498
That I will become like the both of you.

1:24:53.500 --> 1:24:55.456
But this, don't do this.

1:24:55.458 --> 1:24:58.915
We're not in the motel anymore, J.C..

1:24:58.917 --> 1:25:00.292
We are free.

1:25:02.875 --> 1:25:04.167
We are free.

1:26:43.646 --> 1:26:44.580
Angeli?

1:27:45.917 --> 1:27:47.000
Forgive me.

1:28:13.625 --> 1:28:14.625
She's gone.

1:28:16.542 --> 1:28:18.208
The beast has her too.

1:28:20.875 --> 1:28:21.708
I hope...

1:28:22.792 --> 1:28:24.417
I hope she found her way home.

1:28:30.083 --> 1:28:32.667
A great fear washes over me.

1:28:35.042 --> 1:28:36.500
I am alone.
