WEBVTT

00:00.437 --> 00:03.802
Beware! For evil
lurks within these woods!

00:04.426 --> 00:07.872
I, your Pixie guide,
welcome you, brave travelers,

00:07.942 --> 00:09.808
Snotly Goldweaver,

00:09.876 --> 00:11.943
Toshitus Wolfsbane,

00:12.012 --> 00:14.430
Drew of Barrymore.

00:14.465 --> 00:17.349
You must save the fair
maiden from peril.

00:17.367 --> 00:18.500
Oh, no!

00:18.568 --> 00:20.302
Is peril like danger?!

00:20.370 --> 00:21.503
Yes!

00:21.571 --> 00:22.904
We've discussed this.

00:22.973 --> 00:24.572
And it comes in the form

00:24.641 --> 00:27.776
of a red lightning
storm from the warlocks.

00:30.580 --> 00:32.847
A home intruder.

00:32.849 --> 00:36.184
You outrun the storm
on your noble steeds.

00:37.854 --> 00:39.854
And he's on horseback!

00:39.923 --> 00:42.524
I always knew I'd have to kill a horse.

00:42.592 --> 00:46.328
To the west,
you hear a fair goblin maiden.

00:47.397 --> 00:48.596
Help!

00:48.665 --> 00:50.598
I'm imprisoned in an evil warlock's

00:50.667 --> 00:52.334
Tower of Despair!

00:52.402 --> 00:53.868
Save me!

00:53.870 --> 00:56.805
Oh, my God, goblin chicks get me so hot.

00:56.873 --> 00:58.406
What's going on down here?

00:58.474 --> 00:59.941
Oh, hello, traveler!

01:00.010 --> 01:03.478
Welcome to The Dark
Kingdom of Smithurnia!

01:03.547 --> 01:04.879
Pretty awesome, huh?

01:04.881 --> 01:06.748
It's my Dungeons & Dragons masterpiece.

01:06.817 --> 01:10.284
Steve, why do you make it
so hard to love you?

01:10.354 --> 01:11.686
I'll have you know, Mr. Smith,

01:11.755 --> 01:14.622
your son is the best
dungeon master around.

01:14.691 --> 01:18.827
He brings the game to life
by acting out every part!

01:18.895 --> 01:20.628
You flatter me, Snotly!

01:20.697 --> 01:23.698
Dude, she is into you!

01:23.700 --> 01:25.233
Why don't you play with us, dad?

01:25.301 --> 01:26.634
It's a really fun game.

01:26.703 --> 01:28.770
This... This is not a game.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.438
Baseball is a game.

01:30.506 --> 01:32.240
And I'm trying to watch it upstairs.

01:32.308 --> 01:33.775
Baseball's still around?

01:33.844 --> 01:36.378
Is baseball the one
with all the footballs?

01:36.446 --> 01:38.780
Steve, Yoshi, Barney, Slimer,

01:38.849 --> 01:41.783
just keep it quiet down here, okay?

01:43.587 --> 01:46.254
So, how 'bout that goblin maiden?

01:46.322 --> 01:48.790
Is she still... hot to trot?

01:48.859 --> 01:49.924
No.

01:49.993 --> 01:52.460
She's become too crestfallen for love.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.862
Well, does she have a sister?

01:53.930 --> 01:57.732
Yeah, she does, and she's even hotter.

01:57.801 --> 02:00.334
But she has a latex allergy.

02:00.404 --> 02:01.536
Do her anyway!

02:01.605 --> 02:04.005

I'm observing my favorite
baseball tradition.

02:50.787 --> 02:52.186
"Take Me Out to the Ball Game"

02:52.188 --> 02:54.723
is basically my favorite
song by Albert Von Tilzer,

02:54.791 --> 02:57.191
right behind
"I'm the Lonesomest Gal in Town,"

02:57.193 --> 02:59.728
"Oh, How She Could Yakky
Hacky Wicky Wacky Woo,"

02:59.796 --> 03:01.063
"Honeyboy," "Chili Bean,"

03:01.131 --> 03:02.931
"Put On Your Slippers
and Fill Up Your Pipe,"

03:02.999 --> 03:04.999
"Au Revoir, But Not Goodbye,
Soldier Boy,"

03:05.068 --> 03:06.935
and "My Cutie's Due at Two to Two."

03:19.176 --> 03:20.014
Check it out, Dad.

03:20.083 --> 03:23.017
I made a Dungeons & Dragons
style baseball game!

03:23.086 --> 03:26.554
Your favorite game and my
favorite game combined!

03:26.623 --> 03:28.290
Into...

03:28.358 --> 03:30.424
our favorite game?

03:30.426 --> 03:31.893
- Never.
- Come on, Dad!

03:31.962 --> 03:34.096
Y-Your character is Bill the Shortstop!

03:34.164 --> 03:37.432
He has max ratings in wisdom
and turning double plays.

03:37.501 --> 03:38.633
Just roll the die!

03:38.702 --> 03:41.069
First, I'm going to roll my eyes.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.175
You rolled an 18,
so that's a sacrifice bunt!

03:47.243 --> 03:50.378
- Cool, huh?
- It's the exact opposite of cool.

03:50.447 --> 03:51.445
So...

03:51.447 --> 03:52.580
- hot?
- Damn it!

03:52.649 --> 03:54.182
Why does every temperature mean "good"?

03:54.250 --> 03:56.518
My point is, why make a dumb dice game

03:56.586 --> 03:58.853
when real baseball is happening
right in front of you?

03:58.922 --> 04:01.723
That's an ad for a dating
service for Flat-Earthers.

04:01.792 --> 04:04.326
Yes, but between
the commercials is baseball.

04:04.394 --> 04:05.593
As the world changes,

04:05.662 --> 04:07.862
it's the one thing that stays the same.

04:07.931 --> 04:09.864
It's been uniting fathers and sons

04:09.866 --> 04:11.065
for a hundred years.

04:11.067 --> 04:12.800
But you wouldn't understand, Steve.

04:12.869 --> 04:14.402
You don't even have a son.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.004
<i>And there's Commissioner Mahotz</i>

04:16.072 --> 04:17.872
<i>watching from his luxury box.</i>

04:17.874 --> 04:19.673
<i>He cannot be happy about tonight's</i>

04:19.676 --> 04:20.809
<i>record-low attendance.</i>

04:20.877 --> 04:22.477
<i>Just look at all those fathers</i>

04:22.546 --> 04:26.214
<i>sitting next to empty seats
where their sons should be.</i>

04:26.282 --> 04:27.349
He's right.

04:27.417 --> 04:28.750
It's the sons' fault.

04:28.819 --> 04:30.284
You're someone's son, Steve.

04:30.286 --> 04:32.086
Maybe you can tell me why
our Little League field

04:32.156 --> 04:33.421
was turned into a dog park.

04:33.490 --> 04:34.689
That was actually a measure

04:34.758 --> 04:35.957
presented to the voters last...

04:36.026 --> 04:39.161
And I voted yes!
The dogs need a place to go!

04:41.165 --> 04:42.764
- Git! Git!
- What's happening?

04:42.833 --> 04:44.833
One minute till "Sex Hospital" starts!

04:44.901 --> 04:46.234
Quick! Set everything up!

04:46.302 --> 04:47.969
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Hurry!

05:02.318 --> 05:04.252
The cancer patients are gonna freak out

05:04.320 --> 05:06.120
when they realize Dr. Gudreaux is

05:06.122 --> 05:08.790
actually Nurse Tammy
wearing his face skin!

05:08.859 --> 05:11.325
I love this show's twists.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.195
I never see 'em coming!

05:13.263 --> 05:16.664
Hi, I'm "Sex Hospital"
actor Jason Chapman.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.601
And in our biggest plot twist ever,

05:19.669 --> 05:21.269
<i>we've been cancelled!</i>

05:21.337 --> 05:24.072
<i>Now enjoy this rerun of
"Maury" already in progress.</i>

05:24.140 --> 05:27.075
<i>Help me, Maury!
My daughter's a bitch!</i>

05:27.143 --> 05:30.012
<i>Who's da bitch when
you ate all the Otterpops?!</i>

05:30.080 --> 05:33.215
How could you betray me,
"Sex Hospital"?!

05:33.283 --> 05:34.616
Yaaah!

05:35.234 --> 05:35.950
Aaaaah!

05:36.019 --> 05:40.021
What will I do without
my daily dose of drama?!

05:40.090 --> 05:41.689
Francine, what would you say

05:41.758 --> 05:43.291
if I told you that I could provide you

05:43.359 --> 05:45.227
with soap-opera- caliber drama

05:45.295 --> 05:47.028
right here in your very own home?

05:47.097 --> 05:49.764
I'd say go get a broom and
clean up all this shit.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.867
And then do your thing!

05:53.753 --> 05:56.404
My dad's never gonna be proud of me,
no matter what I do.

05:56.473 --> 05:58.740
My dad's not alive, but my mom says

05:58.809 --> 06:02.343
he's super-disappointed
looking down at me from heaven.

06:02.412 --> 06:04.145
But I think he's super-disappointed

06:04.214 --> 06:06.114
looking up at me from hell.

06:06.364 --> 06:08.615
_

06:08.751 --> 06:10.285
This is all interesting,

06:10.353 --> 06:12.687
but how does it help me?

06:12.756 --> 06:15.624
How does it help Barry get ahead?

06:20.097 --> 06:22.430
Hey, kid! Throw it back!

06:22.499 --> 06:26.034
That's my ex-wife's house,
and I can't be within 75 feet!

06:26.103 --> 06:27.568
Don't do it, kid!

06:27.638 --> 06:30.171
He's just gonna give the
ball to one of his whores!

06:30.173 --> 06:31.572
I don't know if I can get it there,

06:31.642 --> 06:34.175
but here goes nothing.

06:43.320 --> 06:48.223
Oh my God!

06:52.595 --> 06:55.330
Barry, what is it, boy?
Is there trouble?

06:55.398 --> 06:56.665
Mr. Smith...

06:56.733 --> 06:59.267
you gotta go to the baseball field...

06:59.336 --> 07:00.535
and see Steve!

07:00.603 --> 07:02.803
My son's on the diamond?!

07:02.805 --> 07:04.806
To the baseball field!

07:12.215 --> 07:13.348
Steve?

07:13.416 --> 07:15.750
Oh, my God! He's pitching!

07:17.488 --> 07:21.756
Oh, it's just a Steve-shaped
adult with a beautiful face.

07:21.824 --> 07:23.225
Dad! I'm right here!

07:25.295 --> 07:28.229
Son! You're technically
part of baseball!

07:28.298 --> 07:31.032
That's my boy out there,
calling balls and strikes!

07:31.101 --> 07:33.101
- My boy's out there, too.
- Where?

07:34.276 --> 07:37.506
Somewhere.
He was kidnapped 30 years ago.

07:37.574 --> 07:41.510
I can still feel it in my
heart that he's alive, though.

07:41.578 --> 07:43.244
Sometimes you just got to take a break

07:43.246 --> 07:44.445
from searching, you know?

07:44.447 --> 07:46.247
Enjoy some baseball.

07:46.249 --> 07:48.350
Well, back to it.

07:55.124 --> 07:57.124
Stee-rike three!

07:57.126 --> 07:58.193
Great call, son!

07:58.261 --> 08:00.195
Does he need to be sitting here?

08:00.263 --> 08:02.063
In your dream version of this,

08:02.131 --> 08:03.999
where does the umpire's dad sit?

08:04.067 --> 08:06.267
- In the stands?
- Eat shit.

08:06.336 --> 08:07.602
Steve, I just have to know.

08:07.671 --> 08:10.005
- How did you become an umpire?
- Time out!

08:10.073 --> 08:12.740
I need to bring my dad up to speed.

08:12.810 --> 08:14.476
Here goes nothing...

08:23.753 --> 08:25.821
Oh, my God!

08:25.889 --> 08:27.622
What a nerd!

08:33.578 --> 08:34.830
No!

08:34.898 --> 08:37.298
Now we can't finish our game!

08:37.366 --> 08:40.368
Is there an umpire in the house?!

08:40.914 --> 08:43.171
Steve, you learned
all the baseball rules

08:43.173 --> 08:45.674
to make your D&D game, right?

08:47.244 --> 08:48.710
Turns out, being an umpire

08:48.778 --> 08:50.846
is a lot like playing
Dungeons & Dragons.

08:50.914 --> 08:52.780
You just keep the game moving along,

08:52.850 --> 08:56.784
and it doesn't hurt to
be an amazing showman.

08:56.854 --> 08:58.186
Play ball!

09:01.725 --> 09:04.926
Much like the light in my old lantern...

09:05.508 --> 09:06.862
you're out!

09:10.133 --> 09:13.601
Your quest around the bases has ended...

09:13.670 --> 09:15.002
safely!

09:17.741 --> 09:20.275
You're out!

09:28.418 --> 09:29.885
Get your face out of that phone, Ian!

09:29.953 --> 09:33.154
You have baseball legends
David Ortiz and Ken Griffey Jr.

09:33.223 --> 09:34.689
at your birthday party!

09:34.758 --> 09:36.624
Baseball's for old people, Dad.

09:36.693 --> 09:39.360
They watch it while
getting colonoscopies.

09:39.429 --> 09:41.296
<i>Like the body odor of a cyclops,</i>

09:41.364 --> 09:43.965
<i>I call that ball foul!</i>

09:44.033 --> 09:46.634
Wait, you're watching baseball?

09:46.703 --> 09:49.437
No, I'm watching this umpire kid.

09:49.439 --> 09:52.240
His video's been shared
over a million times!

09:52.242 --> 09:54.109
He's exactly what I need

09:54.177 --> 09:55.911
to get kids into baseball again.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.982
David, I have a confession.

10:01.050 --> 10:03.050
I'm not the real Ken Griffey Jr.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.252
That's okay.

10:04.321 --> 10:06.521
I'm not the real David Ortiz.

10:06.590 --> 10:08.323
Then we have a problem.

10:08.391 --> 10:10.658
'Cause I am the real Ken Griffey Jr.

10:10.727 --> 10:13.060
I wanted to lure you,
and lure you I did.

10:13.130 --> 10:14.462
Now, listen up.

10:14.464 --> 10:17.399
You pay me $3 million
before close of day,

10:17.467 --> 10:19.735
or the world will learn your secret.

10:25.609 --> 10:27.542
Babe, is this your underwear?

10:27.611 --> 10:31.212
Your enormous men's
underwear with Tuttle's name

10:31.281 --> 10:32.480
written on the band?!

10:32.482 --> 10:34.015
Did you have sex with Tuttle?

10:34.083 --> 10:35.083
What's that now?

10:35.152 --> 10:38.019
Dun, dun, duuuuun!

10:38.088 --> 10:40.422
Roger, this is no "Sex Hospital."

10:40.490 --> 10:42.423
No, it's better, because I'm screwing

10:42.492 --> 10:44.359
with these people's lives for real!

10:44.427 --> 10:46.094
Wait a minute.

10:46.163 --> 10:49.831
I don't wear bras! Whose is this?!

10:49.899 --> 10:52.900
I gotta say,
I don't even buy them as a couple.

10:52.902 --> 10:57.104
One's this macho alpha
surging with testosterone,

10:57.106 --> 10:58.706
and then there's Jeff.

10:58.708 --> 11:01.909
Plus, there's no conflict.
They're working it out.

11:04.648 --> 11:07.582
I'm gonna put a baby in you!

11:08.251 --> 11:10.451
Nationals Stadium, Steve.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.919
Kind of overwhelming.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.255
So take it in and get
all the butterflies out

11:14.324 --> 11:16.324
before you umpire tonight.

11:16.326 --> 11:17.993
Oh, there's the new groundskeeper.

11:18.061 --> 11:19.527
I should give him the same speech.

11:19.529 --> 11:22.864
Wow, my son, called up to the show!

11:22.932 --> 11:23.999
Just look around.

11:24.067 --> 11:26.101
You can almost taste the history.

11:28.779 --> 11:32.273
Hmm. Notes of chewing tobacco,
sunflower seeds,

11:32.342 --> 11:33.809
but very dirt-forward.

11:33.877 --> 11:37.212
This is definitely a dish
where dirt is the star.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.614
- Pretty cool, huh, Dad?
- It is.

11:39.683 --> 11:41.616
You're part of a sacred tradition now,

11:41.685 --> 11:43.284
so dial back your tricks a little

11:43.353 --> 11:45.286
and let the game stand on its own.

11:45.355 --> 11:47.322
- You got it, Dad.
- That's my boy.

11:47.324 --> 11:48.556
Now, if you'll excuse me,

11:48.625 --> 11:50.425
that dirt's got me
feeling a little sick.

11:50.494 --> 11:52.894
So I'm gonna go eat some
of that outfield grass,

11:52.962 --> 11:54.762
settle the old stomach.

11:54.764 --> 11:58.233
Kid, more people saw your video
than saw the game last night.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.769
So tonight, I want you to go full Steve.

12:01.771 --> 12:03.038
Give the fans what they want!

12:03.106 --> 12:04.772
But my dad says I have to preserve

12:04.842 --> 12:06.842
the traditions of this great game.

12:06.910 --> 12:08.376
Well, maybe your dad's wrong.

12:08.378 --> 12:11.847
I mean, he is trying to eat AstroTurf.

12:14.384 --> 12:16.451
Unless you've been living under a rock,

12:16.520 --> 12:18.586
you've heard about Steve Smith.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.455
The tiny teen's signature flair

12:20.524 --> 12:24.192
has made him the hottest
umpire in baseball.

12:24.261 --> 12:28.063
However, some traditionalists
don't like the way his calls

12:28.131 --> 12:30.998
are getting bigger and flashier.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.935
But Smith's antics
are putting kids' butts

12:34.003 --> 12:36.872
back-back-back-back-back
back-back-back-back-back

12:36.940 --> 12:39.407
back-back-back-back-back-back-
back-back-back-back-back-back-

12:39.409 --> 12:43.211
back-back-back-back-back-back-
back-back-back in the seats!

12:43.213 --> 12:46.281
Stee-rike three!

12:47.551 --> 12:50.218
Smith is revolutionizing the sport,

12:50.220 --> 12:52.220
and some are even saying he could...

12:52.289 --> 12:55.290
go... all... the... way...

12:55.358 --> 12:57.693
to the Hall of Fame...

12:57.761 --> 12:59.026
of Umpires...

12:59.096 --> 13:00.495
at the Dallas Airport...

13:00.564 --> 13:02.630
in a little room off
the baggage claim...

13:02.632 --> 13:04.432
- which is usually locked.
- _

13:05.835 --> 13:07.903
That was my hand.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.907
Francine, thank you for your notes.

13:11.975 --> 13:15.711
They got me thinking, "Wow,
what terrible notes."

13:15.779 --> 13:18.714
And now... a tidal wave of genius.

13:19.691 --> 13:21.383
I'm coming!

13:21.451 --> 13:24.252
Are you... Klaus?

13:24.321 --> 13:26.321
Hell, yeah, baby.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.856
But it looks like I'm a
little late to the trough.

13:28.926 --> 13:32.327
What? No. This is <i> your</i> baby!

13:32.395 --> 13:33.595
Impossible!

13:33.663 --> 13:35.130
I mean, it's possible

13:35.198 --> 13:36.598
because I'm constantly banging chicks,

13:36.666 --> 13:39.134
but not for the last couple 5, 10 years!

13:39.202 --> 13:41.469
Yes, but you donate sperm,

13:41.538 --> 13:42.938
and I was in a car accident

13:43.006 --> 13:45.206
with a truck that was delivering it!

13:45.275 --> 13:48.143
Dun, dun, duuuuun!

13:48.211 --> 13:51.479
My God, I'm going to be a dad!

13:51.481 --> 13:54.349
Oh, now you're ready to be a dad!

13:54.417 --> 13:57.752
Where were you 38 years ago?!

13:57.821 --> 14:00.688
- What?
- You gave me up for adoption,

14:00.757 --> 14:02.290
according to these papers

14:02.359 --> 14:04.826
that were anonymously mailed to me!

14:04.894 --> 14:06.694
This is insane!

14:06.763 --> 14:08.296
You know what else is insane?

14:08.365 --> 14:10.498
You have only one week left to live.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.899
I found out when these test results

14:11.969 --> 14:14.702
were tied to a rock and
thrown through my window.

14:17.396 --> 14:18.640
- Meh.
- "Meh"?!

14:18.708 --> 14:20.842
These characters aren't believable!

14:20.910 --> 14:23.979
I mean, the fish? He talks? How?

14:24.047 --> 14:25.313
And apparently,

14:25.315 --> 14:27.715
he doesn't even have to be in water.

14:27.717 --> 14:31.653
Just, like, touching it?
That's now how fish work!

14:40.864 --> 14:41.997
Steve, what the heck?

14:42.065 --> 14:43.931
Since when is riding
players around the bases

14:43.933 --> 14:45.667
- traditional?
- Don't worry, dad.

14:45.735 --> 14:47.268
Your favorite part's coming up...

14:47.337 --> 14:49.604
the seventh-inning stretch!

14:50.206 --> 14:52.007
At least some things haven't changed.

14:52.075 --> 14:53.809
Take me there, Ernie.

14:53.877 --> 14:58.880
♪ <i>Oh, take me out to the ball game</i> ♪

14:58.948 --> 15:00.281

15:11.581 --> 15:13.279
Stop! You're ruining everything!

15:13.314 --> 15:14.762
This isn't baseball anymore!

15:14.832 --> 15:16.832
Baseball was on life support!

15:16.900 --> 15:19.634
Its family members were
gathered at the hospital.

15:19.703 --> 15:21.636
It was peeing into a bag.

15:21.705 --> 15:23.971
Orderlies were stealing its valuables.

15:23.973 --> 15:27.175
Steve, our live-stream
ratings are through the roof!

15:27.177 --> 15:28.443
I'm promoting you

15:28.512 --> 15:30.778
to deputy commissioner
of game development.

15:30.780 --> 15:32.580
But that'll put him in
charge of rule changes,

15:32.582 --> 15:34.782
and he's wrecking everything!

15:34.852 --> 15:36.651
I was thinking it would be kind of cool

15:36.720 --> 15:38.319
if the pitcher used a crossbow

15:38.388 --> 15:39.787
to shoot the ball at the batter.

15:39.857 --> 15:42.057
Genius! But what about the batters?

15:42.125 --> 15:43.925
Wouldn't that be a
little unfair to them?

15:43.993 --> 15:45.593
Who cares about the batters?!

15:45.662 --> 15:47.128
They'll be on horseback!

15:47.197 --> 15:49.130
Horses! Yes!

15:49.199 --> 15:50.532
But what kind of horse?

15:50.600 --> 15:52.934
Like a Doberman pinscher?
Or a big-ass bobcat?

15:53.002 --> 15:55.470
Do you... know what a horse is?

15:55.539 --> 15:58.540
Of course I do. I'm Commissioner Mahotz.

15:58.608 --> 16:01.576
I know all the animals!

16:05.148 --> 16:07.882
Now that I'm not trying to
make my dad proud anymore,

16:07.951 --> 16:10.685
I'm doing baseball the Steve way.

16:10.753 --> 16:11.886
I like what you're doing here.

16:11.955 --> 16:13.955
This whole Steve thing... I love it.

16:13.957 --> 16:15.757
- First, some rule changes.
- Yes.

16:15.826 --> 16:18.426
I'm replacing the ball
with a 20-sided die.

16:18.495 --> 16:19.760
- Mm.
- After it's hit,

16:19.762 --> 16:21.296
whatever number the die lands on

16:21.364 --> 16:23.098
- determines the outcome of the play.
- Love it!

16:23.166 --> 16:25.233
Runners must do battle
with Samurai warriors...

16:25.302 --> 16:27.302
- Yep. Love it!
- ...to get from base to base.

16:27.370 --> 16:28.770
- That's so good!
- And there's a moat.

16:28.839 --> 16:30.571
- Now we're talking!
- Filled with piranhas

16:30.641 --> 16:32.441
- surrounding home plate!
- Yes!

16:32.509 --> 16:33.708
That settles it!

16:33.777 --> 16:35.243
We're premiering your
new version of baseball

16:35.312 --> 16:38.647
tomorrow night at Game 1
of the World Series!

16:38.715 --> 16:40.248
Except we're now calling it

16:40.317 --> 16:44.252
"Lemony Snicket's World
Series of Unfortunate Events."

16:45.191 --> 16:46.321
Love it!

16:48.925 --> 16:51.592
Damn it, couch!
First, I find you upstairs.

16:51.662 --> 16:52.994
Now you're on the staircase.

16:53.063 --> 16:54.729
Think you're too good
for the living room?!

16:54.798 --> 16:56.064
It's good enough for TV!

16:56.133 --> 16:58.533
It's good enough for coffee table!

16:58.601 --> 17:01.002
Oh, God, I... I'm sorry, couch!

17:01.071 --> 17:03.738
I'm mad at Steve,
and I'm taking it out on you!

17:03.807 --> 17:06.741
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God. Stan, what's wrong?

17:06.810 --> 17:10.011
Your son killed the game I love most

17:10.079 --> 17:12.547
- in the wuh-huh-horld!
- Oh, honey.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.949
- Let's talk about this.
- Francine, what are you doing?!

17:15.018 --> 17:16.284
This is low-stakes bullshit.

17:16.353 --> 17:18.618
There's real scripted drama outside.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.755
Francine, I bristled at your notes

17:20.823 --> 17:23.023
because I'm an artist, but the audience,

17:23.026 --> 17:26.627
as unenlightened as she may be,
is always right.

17:26.696 --> 17:28.763
So now I present to you...

17:28.832 --> 17:30.832
drama perfected.

17:30.901 --> 17:32.767
I've been poisoned!

17:32.836 --> 17:34.169
Could it have been that sandwich

17:34.237 --> 17:36.571
that was shoved through my mail slot?!

17:36.639 --> 17:38.707
FBI! We found your underwear

17:38.775 --> 17:40.509
in the vault at the robbed bank!

17:40.577 --> 17:41.776
The robbed bank?

17:41.845 --> 17:43.178
How do you know about the robbed bank?

17:43.246 --> 17:45.681
We kept that out of the press!

17:46.517 --> 17:47.616
Ooh!

17:53.857 --> 17:56.257
- Killer stuff, right?
- I-I don't know.

17:56.259 --> 18:00.261
I-I guess I just saw
all this stuff coming.

18:00.263 --> 18:02.397
Freeze, mister! Hands in the air!

18:02.465 --> 18:04.332
Ooh! This is a fun twist!

18:04.401 --> 18:06.134
No! No! No! This wasn't part of it!

18:06.203 --> 18:08.469
You're under arrest
for sandwich poisoning,

18:08.471 --> 18:11.672
bluebird seduction,
and sperm truck sabotage!

18:11.674 --> 18:13.875
I can explain! I'm an artist!

18:13.944 --> 18:15.676
Merely a humble genius!

18:15.746 --> 18:17.746
Bravo, Roger!

18:17.814 --> 18:19.680
I'm not going back to prison!

18:24.821 --> 18:26.687
Another semen truck?

18:26.689 --> 18:27.822
What's going on in this town?

18:27.891 --> 18:29.424
Are we on a shipping route?

18:40.237 --> 18:43.972
I was wrong before.
<i>This</i> is my masterpiece.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.440
Sorry, kid. I wasn't there before.

18:45.508 --> 18:47.842
You called something
else your masterpiece?

18:47.911 --> 18:49.310
- That what happened?
- Basically, yeah.

18:49.379 --> 18:50.879
That's the gist.

18:58.655 --> 19:00.255
He rolled a 12!

19:00.323 --> 19:01.790
Release the lion!

19:04.661 --> 19:05.927
<i>Release the Lion,</i>

19:05.996 --> 19:08.263
<i>brought to you by Big League Chew!</i>

19:08.331 --> 19:12.467
<i>What'll you be chewin'
when the lion's chewin' on you?</i>

19:12.535 --> 19:14.335
It's a packed house, kid.

19:14.337 --> 19:18.273
Generations of fans,
bonding over your game!

19:22.412 --> 19:24.479
I guess you don't totally suck.

19:24.547 --> 19:28.617
I've brought all these
fathers and sons together...

19:28.685 --> 19:31.886
but I've lost my own dad.

19:31.955 --> 19:35.423
No! He... He came! Dad! Up here!

19:37.694 --> 19:41.963
Oh. It's just a dad-shaped
man with the face of an angel.

19:42.032 --> 19:44.633
I want my daddy!

19:45.277 --> 19:46.768
Dad?! Are you home?!

19:49.640 --> 19:51.640
Runner steals second.

19:51.708 --> 19:53.508
You're playing my game.

19:53.576 --> 19:56.311
It's the only decent
version of baseball left.

19:56.379 --> 19:58.713
Dad, I'm sorry I ruined your game.

19:58.782 --> 20:00.181
Yeah, well...

20:00.183 --> 20:02.717
I'm sorry I crapped all over your game.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.053
You actually did a great job.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.721
What dice do I roll to slide?

20:06.790 --> 20:09.991
- Oh, you just use your imagination.
- Huh.

20:12.996 --> 20:14.262
Help me, Steve! It's not working!

20:14.331 --> 20:18.266
You slide safely into second,
just under the tag.

20:18.904 --> 20:21.269
Whoa! Now I'm gonna try to steal third!

20:21.338 --> 20:25.406
You gallantly stride toward third base.

20:25.408 --> 20:27.676
But, alas, you are thrown out.

20:27.744 --> 20:29.144
Wow!

20:29.212 --> 20:32.280
It's just like I wasn't able to imagine.

20:32.349 --> 20:34.883
I wonder what's happening
in the real game.

20:36.487 --> 20:38.086
<i>Folks, you're watching</i>

20:38.155 --> 20:40.421
<i>the greatest tragedy in sports history!</i>

20:40.491 --> 20:42.157
<i>Op, it sounds like attack monkeys</i>

20:42.225 --> 20:44.092
<i>are clawing at my door.</i>

20:44.161 --> 20:46.495
<i>In these, the last moments of my life,</i>

20:46.563 --> 20:49.898
<i>I'd like to do the
on-air ad for Meineke.</i>

20:49.966 --> 20:52.433
<i>Has your muffler been giving you guff?</i>

20:53.105 --> 20:54.703
<i>No, monkey!</i>

20:58.575 --> 21:00.375
Buh-bye! See you soon!
