00:00.033 --> 00:02.800
You and your children
lived with your mother.

00:02.867 --> 00:07.033
She kicked me out of her home and
all of my family went against me.

00:07.100 --> 00:10.734
We were having problems.
I said, "I can't take this anymore."

00:10.800 --> 00:13.033
She's a kid.
She's a kid with four children.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.934
[narrator] <i>This is </i>Judy Justice...

00:16.000 --> 00:17.500
[theme music playing]

00:32.600 --> 00:36.600
<i>Viola Hires is suing</i>
<i>her daughter, Annalise Araujo,</i>

00:36.667 --> 00:41.734
<i>for credit card charges resulting from</i>
<i>her daughter's tummy tuck surgery.</i>

00:41.800 --> 00:43.934
[Kevin] All rise.
Court come to order.

00:49.934 --> 00:53.533
Hello, Judge. We have case number 1005,
Hires versus Araujo.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.133
Thank you. Be seated, please.

00:56.734 --> 00:59.233
-Miss Hires, this is your daughter?
-Yes.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.433
[Judy] And this case
is about whether or not

01:01.500 --> 01:05.567
you had agreed to pay for
a cosmetic surgery procedure for her.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.533
Your daughter said that you did,
in fact, pay for it,

01:08.600 --> 01:11.200
put it on your credit card, it was a gift,
it was your idea,

01:11.266 --> 01:14.433
and it was never designed to be a loan.
That's what the case is about.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.934
-Correct?
-Yes.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.233
Ms. Hires, I want a little background
information about both of you.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.166
-Are you employed?
-No, not right now.

01:21.233 --> 01:24.266
Your daughter got her plastic surgery
in what month and year?

01:24.333 --> 01:28.133
It was last year, around--
At the end of Mar-- April

01:28.200 --> 01:29.567
Not April, sorry, August.

01:29.633 --> 01:31.967
In what month did you
get your plastic surgery?

01:32.033 --> 01:33.300
It was in September.

01:33.367 --> 01:36.066
-September of 2020?
-September of 2020, yes.

01:36.133 --> 01:38.000
Okay. Were you working
in September of 2020?

01:38.066 --> 01:39.867
-No.
-How do you support yourself?

01:39.934 --> 01:43.467
I get income from my daughter,
my other daughter,

01:43.533 --> 01:47.367
and I also get a monthly income
from Social Security.

01:47.433 --> 01:49.066
Social Security Disability,
or Social Security--

01:49.133 --> 01:51.734
-Yes. Yes.
-Social Security Disability.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.367
And what kind of income do you
receive from your other daughter?

01:54.433 --> 01:56.000
She pays for rent.

01:56.066 --> 01:57.433
Okay, so she lives with you?

01:57.500 --> 02:00.333
-Yes.
-Okay. What kind of work does she do?

02:00.400 --> 02:02.433
She's a health-care worker.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.834
And how much do you
receive from Disability?

02:04.900 --> 02:08.033
I receive around $989.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.100
Any other income in the house?

02:10.166 --> 02:13.734
Just my daughter's and
my son-in-law which lives with me.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.166
He pays rent as well.

02:15.233 --> 02:18.967
-That would be her husband?
-Husband. Yes.

02:19.033 --> 02:20.333
What kind of work do you do?

02:20.400 --> 02:22.900
I'm actually not working right now,
I'm a homemaker.

02:22.967 --> 02:25.200
Were you working in September of 2020?

02:25.266 --> 02:27.700
Yes, I was. I was doing customer service
at a warehouse.

02:27.767 --> 02:29.200
How long did you work?

02:29.266 --> 02:32.467
-I worked there for seven years.
-[Judy] Until when?

02:32.533 --> 02:35.133
Until February of this year.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.633
And what happened in February of 2021?

02:37.700 --> 02:43.066
In February of 2021, I stopped working
due to COVID and childcare.

02:43.133 --> 02:46.367
Well, you didn't have any children
after February of 2021.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.967
I had some custody of my daughter.

02:49.033 --> 02:52.600
No, no. You didn't have any more children
after February.

02:52.667 --> 02:54.467
-No, I didn't.
-[Judy] So, you had children

02:54.533 --> 02:56.934
-while you were working for seven years.
-[Annalise] Yes, I did.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.600
So, my question is,
why did you stop working?

02:59.667 --> 03:02.133
Because my mother
kicked me out of her home

03:02.200 --> 03:04.400
and all of my family went against me.

03:04.467 --> 03:06.967
So I no longer had the help
that I had before.

03:07.033 --> 03:08.934
-That's not true, Your Honor.
-[Judy] Wh-- Just a second.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.200
Where did you move to?

03:10.266 --> 03:12.567
I moved to my boyfriend's house,
because my mother--

03:12.633 --> 03:15.233
Ju-ju-- Just answer my question.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.500
-You moved to your boyfriend's house.
-Yes, I did.

03:17.567 --> 03:21.200
So, what I gather is
you and your husband

03:21.266 --> 03:24.600
and your children, some of them,
lived with your mother.

03:24.667 --> 03:25.900
Yes, we did.

03:25.967 --> 03:27.667
How many years
did you live with your mother?

03:27.734 --> 03:29.867
We lived with my mother for five years.

03:29.934 --> 03:33.467
And during that time, you were working and
contributing to the household, I assume.

03:33.533 --> 03:34.767
-Yes.
-And so was your husband.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.433
-Was he working as well?
-[Annalise] Yes, he was.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.600
-[Judy] How many children do you have?
-I have four.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.567
-How old are they?
-[Annalise] I have an eight-year-old,

03:40.633 --> 03:42.500
a four-year-old and two one-year-olds.

03:42.567 --> 03:44.166
Which of those children live with you now?

03:44.233 --> 03:46.867
Actually, none of them live with me. I--

03:46.934 --> 03:48.233
Just-- J-J--

03:48.300 --> 03:49.900
-Just answer the question.
-Okay.

03:49.967 --> 03:51.900
So you have four children,
none of them live with you.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.433
-Yes.
-[Judy] So, you want to explain to me

03:54.500 --> 03:58.600
[laughing] why you stopped working
in February of 2021?

03:58.667 --> 04:02.066
Because at the time, I did have
partial custody of my daughter.

04:02.133 --> 04:03.500
And how old is she?

04:03.567 --> 04:04.567
She's eight years old.

04:04.633 --> 04:08.834
Okay. And you had partial custody
of her until what month?

04:08.900 --> 04:10.767
Until the end of February.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.200
And then she went to live with whom?

04:13.266 --> 04:16.800
-Her father.
-So in February, I just wanna know

04:16.867 --> 04:18.233
why you weren't working.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.300
-I--
-If you'd worked for seven years,

04:20.367 --> 04:22.400
now you are living with your boyfriend,

04:22.467 --> 04:24.934
and childcare is not an issue--

04:25.000 --> 04:28.667
She did say, if I'm not mistaken,
that the reason she stopped working

04:28.734 --> 04:31.333
was to be a full-time mom? A homemaker.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.367
I think it-- Was the term homemaker
or full-time mom? I'm not sure.

04:34.433 --> 04:37.533
[Whitney] She said, "I'm actually not
working right now. I'm a homemaker."

04:37.600 --> 04:39.033
Who do you make a home for?

04:39.100 --> 04:42.633
For my chil-- I do have my children
on three days of the week.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.600
Which children on which three days?

04:44.667 --> 04:47.133
I have them Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.300
From when to when?

04:48.367 --> 04:50.867
From 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Friday.

04:50.934 --> 04:52.734
Who fixed that time?

04:52.800 --> 04:55.033
The judge did in my other court case
for my children.

04:55.100 --> 04:58.633
Okay. Is there any reason
why the judge didn't make it

04:58.700 --> 05:01.233
[laughing] on a weekend
so you could work?

05:01.300 --> 05:03.133
I-- I mean--

05:03.200 --> 05:06.533
Just so that I understand the people
that I'm dealing with...

05:06.600 --> 05:10.200
When you left your job in February,
did you begin to receive

05:10.266 --> 05:13.500
assistance, unemployment insurance,
anything else?

05:13.567 --> 05:15.000
-I did.
-[Judy] I did.

05:15.066 --> 05:18.667
And tell me how much you received
weekly, monthly...

05:18.734 --> 05:20.633
Weekly, I received $600.

05:20.700 --> 05:24.066
And when you were working
for the seven years that you were working,

05:24.133 --> 05:27.367
in the same place,
what was your salary weekly?

05:27.433 --> 05:29.400
About the same, $600.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.100
Now we know.

05:31.166 --> 05:32.166
[woman laughs]

05:35.467 --> 05:39.200
Okay. It is my understanding
that after your twins were born,

05:39.266 --> 05:42.567
you had this tummy tuck procedure.
And tell me,

05:42.633 --> 05:46.100
was it right after the twins were born
that you and your husband separated?

05:46.166 --> 05:50.800
So, in January of 2020, we split.
In September of 2020, I had the surgery.

05:50.867 --> 05:54.100
And then in October of 2020,
that's when I moved in with my boyfriend.

05:54.166 --> 05:56.000
-In October of 2020?
-Yes.

05:56.066 --> 05:58.800
Tell me about-- Because you say

05:58.867 --> 06:02.734
your mother put this surgical procedure
on a credit card.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.066
And at the time you had
the surgical procedure,

06:06.133 --> 06:09.000
-you were still working at your job.
-Yes, I was.

06:09.066 --> 06:11.000
And your mother was receiving Disability.

06:11.066 --> 06:15.800
You were making at least twice as much as
your mother was getting from Disability,

06:15.867 --> 06:20.333
you were earning from your job
and you were still with your husband.

06:20.400 --> 06:24.900
What I want you to try to explain to me
is why you think

06:24.967 --> 06:30.266
your mother would commit herself
to a $7,000 surgery for you

06:30.333 --> 06:33.233
without expectation of being repaid.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.867
[theme music playing]

06:34.934 --> 06:38.200
After the tummy tuck,
she had left her husband, like she said,

06:38.266 --> 06:40.233
and had a boyfriend.
I didn't care for him.

06:40.300 --> 06:43.934
I told her, "You need to move," I said,
"because I can't take this anymore."

06:44.000 --> 06:45.600
-How old are you?
-Twenty-six.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.600
-And you have four kids?
-[Annalise] Yes.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.266
Yeah, you have enough children
for a while.

06:52.333 --> 06:53.633
[theme music playing]

06:58.467 --> 07:00.700
[narrator] <i>Viola Hires</i>
<i>says her daughter,</i>

07:00.767 --> 07:06.100
<i>Annalise Araujo, owes her for the cost</i>
<i>of Annalise's tummy tuck surgery.</i>

07:06.166 --> 07:10.867
What I want you to try to explain
to me is why you think

07:10.934 --> 07:16.233
your mother would commit herself
to a $7,000 surgery for you

07:16.300 --> 07:19.033
without expectation of being repaid.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.567
Well, at the time, I was
paying my mother's rent,

07:21.633 --> 07:24.734
as well as other bills for her,
so she wasn't paying anything.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.700
Well, you had another sibling
living in the house, didn't you?

07:27.767 --> 07:29.633
Yes, and that sibling
actually doesn't work.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.000
I paid to support her as well.

07:31.066 --> 07:34.533
So, what you're telling me is,
on your $600 a week

07:34.600 --> 07:37.166
you were supporting your mother,
your sister,

07:37.233 --> 07:39.467
your children and your husband?

07:39.533 --> 07:41.767
Is that what you're telling me?
On your $600 a week?

07:41.834 --> 07:44.000
My husband and I were
both supporting them.

07:44.066 --> 07:45.900
-In her house?
-Yes, in her house.

07:45.967 --> 07:47.734
-Are you still in your house?
-Yes.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.400
[Judy] They managed
to get along without you.

07:49.467 --> 07:51.667
Because my ex-husband is paying that bill.

07:51.734 --> 07:53.600
-[Viola] No.
-Is your ex-husband there

07:53.667 --> 07:55.433
with any of the children? Shh!

07:55.967 --> 07:58.900
When you moved out
to move in with your current boyfriend,

07:58.967 --> 08:03.333
and when you went to your boyfriend,
did you take all the children with you?

08:03.400 --> 08:06.066
-No, because they--
-[Judy] Shh-- No-- Not because.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.433
The answer is no.

08:07.500 --> 08:12.000
You moved out in October.
In what month did your son-in-law move in?

08:12.066 --> 08:13.967
He moved in a month after.

08:14.033 --> 08:17.333
And what children were left in the house
when your daughter moved out?

08:17.400 --> 08:19.333
Three boys were left in the house

08:19.400 --> 08:22.233
and the daughter was left
with her other father.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.433
She coulda took her kids when she wanted.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.033
That's not true at all.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.734
[Judy] Your son-in-law now
helps pay rent in the house?

08:29.800 --> 08:33.000
He pays a little bit--
He pays $600, and the rest

08:33.066 --> 08:35.500
he pays for babysitting to my daughter.

08:35.567 --> 08:38.700
And that's the daughter that you say
was a health-care worker?

08:38.767 --> 08:40.433
Yes, she does health care as well.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.400
Okay, but she's not currently working
as a health-care worker?

08:43.467 --> 08:44.667
-Yes, she is. Yes.
-She is?

08:44.734 --> 08:47.133
-And she's taking care of the children?
-She does on the days

08:47.200 --> 08:49.133
he doesn't have them.
She watches the kids--

08:49.200 --> 08:50.700
[Annalise] Which is hard
to believe because--

08:50.767 --> 08:52.200
-Shh-shh-shh-shh.
-[Viola] She watches them

08:52.266 --> 08:56.033
on the days that he doesn't have 'em,
the days he has 'em, I'm sorry.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.767
And the days he doesn't have 'em,
she works.

08:58.834 --> 08:59.934
And how do you help out?

09:00.066 --> 09:03.700
I help out with the house.
I help out with the, uh, utilities--

09:03.767 --> 09:05.100
No, with the children.

09:05.166 --> 09:08.066
Oh. She's the one that babysits them.
If she needs help,

09:08.133 --> 09:10.300
just to change 'em, or something,
I'll be there,

09:10.367 --> 09:12.433
but she's the one that
does mostly everything.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.867
Mm-hm. Does she get any money for doing
that other than from your son-in-law?

09:15.934 --> 09:18.033
-No.
-And does he get any money

09:18.100 --> 09:19.533
-for child care?
-No.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.133
What kind of work does he do?

09:21.200 --> 09:23.734
He works for... driving trucks,
he does on the base.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.100
Okay. Now, I want you to tell me
about this tummy tuck.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.166
I want you to tell me
when the arrangement was made

09:28.233 --> 09:29.667
and when you put it on your credit card.

09:29.734 --> 09:32.900
Okay, over the summer,
she came to me, asking me

09:32.967 --> 09:36.633
if I could put the tummy tuck on my card
because she didn't have the money.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.400
-When this summer?
-Oh, last year.

09:38.467 --> 09:40.767
-She was still living with you?
-Yes, she was living with me.

09:40.834 --> 09:44.900
She asked me to pay for the tummy tuck on
my card and she would pay me every month.

09:44.967 --> 09:46.700
I said, "I have to think about it,"

09:46.767 --> 09:48.233
and I said "Okay,
you know, you're working,

09:48.300 --> 09:50.266
everything's good, I'll do it for you.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.433
You know, you just pay me back
every month, like you said."

09:52.500 --> 09:54.433
And she promised me she would pay it.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.266
Because I don't have that kind of money
to pay every month.

09:57.333 --> 10:00.834
So, then, after that,
when she did get the tummy tuck,

10:00.900 --> 10:03.667
I took care of her,
I did everything for her.

10:03.734 --> 10:07.567
And then after the tummy tuck,
she was better and...

10:07.633 --> 10:10.633
a little bit before that, she had
left her husband, like she said,

10:10.700 --> 10:12.734
and had a boyfriend.
I didn't care for him.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.033
When you say she left her husband,
she didn't leave the house, did she?

10:16.100 --> 10:19.367
[Viola] Yes, after I told her--
Because we were having problems,

10:19.433 --> 10:23.066
I told her, "You need to move," I said,
"because I can't take this anymore."

10:23.133 --> 10:26.066
-[Judy] You mean, she was-- I don't--
-No, she didn't say that at all.

10:26.133 --> 10:29.200
She can't take down
people talking out of turn.

10:29.266 --> 10:31.000
-Do you understand?
-[Annalise] Yes.

10:31.066 --> 10:33.300
-[Judy] Okay. How old are you?
-Twenty-six.

10:33.367 --> 10:36.300
-You're 26 and you have four kids?
-[Annalise] Yes.

10:36.367 --> 10:37.934
Yeah, you have enough children
for a while.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.533
When you had this disagreement
with your daughter...

10:41.600 --> 10:43.934
-Yes.
-That was after the tummy tuck?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.867
No, okay, so, when the tummy tuck
which she wanted, I said,

10:46.934 --> 10:49.567
"You know, I'll do it for you, you know,
you pay it back every month,

10:49.633 --> 10:51.567
-like she promised me--"
-You told me that already.

10:51.633 --> 10:54.633
Okay, and then, after a while,
she left her husband,

10:54.700 --> 10:57.066
and she had a boyfriend,
and I said, "You know what?

10:57.133 --> 11:00.800
I don't think I'm gonna do it because,
you know, everything's spiraling downhill,

11:00.867 --> 11:04.433
I don't care for your boyfriend at all."
I said, "You know, he's--

11:04.500 --> 11:07.667
To me, he's no good," but anyways,
I said, "I'm not gonna do it."

11:07.734 --> 11:10.633
Then she went crying to my sister,
saying, you know, I promised her

11:10.700 --> 11:14.467
I would do it for her and pay for it,
and she would pay every month.

11:14.533 --> 11:17.533
And then, my sister came to me, told me,
you know, you promised whatever,

11:17.600 --> 11:19.500
-So I went to her--
-Is this your sister?

11:19.567 --> 11:21.100
-Yes.
-[Judy] Okay, go ahead.

11:21.166 --> 11:24.333
So I went to her and I told her--
She came crying to me again.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.333
So I went to her and I said, "Okay,
I'll do it, but you promise me,

11:27.400 --> 11:29.000
you know, you'll pay the bill
every month."

11:29.066 --> 11:30.100
-She said she will--
-[Judy] Okay.

11:30.166 --> 11:34.734
And then she would pay her 401K to
pay the remaining when she got her 401K.

11:34.800 --> 11:38.233
When you left your job, did you get
what you had put into your 401K?

11:38.300 --> 11:39.900
-I didn't.
-You didn't. You left it there?

11:39.967 --> 11:41.066
-Yes.
-How much is it?

11:41.133 --> 11:43.667
It was a thousand dollars.

11:43.734 --> 11:47.700
Now, you tell me your version of how it
came about that you had this tummy tuck.

11:47.767 --> 11:51.100
So, in January of 2020, I left my husband.
Shortly--

11:51.166 --> 11:53.867
When you say you left him,
did he leave the house or did you?

11:53.934 --> 11:56.734
No, we were still living together.
He didn't leave the home until June.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.767
When you say you left him,
how did that come about?

11:59.834 --> 12:02.467
Did he go into another room,
did he sleep in another room?

12:02.533 --> 12:05.266
We were sleeping in separate rooms.
He would sleep in the living room,

12:05.333 --> 12:06.667
-I would sleep in the room.
-Okay.

12:06.734 --> 12:10.000
So then, in April, that's when
I started dating my boyfriend.

12:10.066 --> 12:12.433
My mom disliked the whole idea of it
because she wanted me to

12:12.500 --> 12:15.166
stay with my husband because
she's infatuated with him.

12:15.233 --> 12:17.900
Don't-- Don't tell me because why.

12:17.967 --> 12:21.066
So then, throughout those months,
she kept going back and forth with,

12:21.133 --> 12:23.400
"I'm not gonna do this for you.
I'm gonna do this for you.

12:23.467 --> 12:25.567
I'm not gonna do this for you."
And then she would feel bad.

12:25.633 --> 12:27.266
And then she said,
"I'm gonna do this for you."

12:27.333 --> 12:28.367
So then, finally--

12:28.433 --> 12:30.900
Your initial conversation
with your mother.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.066
-Yes.
-You said to your mother,

12:33.133 --> 12:34.767
"I really wanna get a tummy tuck."

12:34.834 --> 12:38.967
That sounds natural. You're 26 years old
and you've had four children,

12:39.033 --> 12:42.033
and you got a new boyfriend,
or that's in the back of your mind.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.133
So that sounds kinda right, to me,

12:44.200 --> 12:45.934
that you said,
"I really wanna get a tummy tuck."

12:46.000 --> 12:49.333
What I want to know is, what arrangement
did you make with your mother

12:49.400 --> 12:52.000
-to pay for it?
-There was no arrangement.

12:52.066 --> 12:54.133
She even offered to
give me her card to hold it

12:54.200 --> 12:55.900
because she kept
going back and forth.

12:55.967 --> 12:57.600
No, that's not what I'm saying to you.

12:57.667 --> 13:00.100
It's clear that you
put it on her credit card.

13:00.166 --> 13:01.700
-Yes, I did.
-[Judy] It's also clear

13:01.767 --> 13:04.400
that your mother doesn't work,
and you did.

13:04.467 --> 13:06.533
When you said she went back and forth,

13:06.600 --> 13:12.333
where did you expect your mother to
get money to pay for your $7,000 surgery?

13:12.400 --> 13:14.900
My mom wasn't paying any bills
and she still doesn't.

13:14.967 --> 13:17.834
My ex-husband pays for everything,
so she has lots of money.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.767
Well, tell me where she has
lots of money from.

13:19.834 --> 13:22.834
She has her Social Security.
She gets money from my ex-husband,

13:22.900 --> 13:23.800
he pays her for babysitting--

13:23.867 --> 13:26.033
No, no, just a second.
Forget your ex-husband.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.633
And he's not your
ex-husband yet, is he?

13:27.700 --> 13:29.600
-He is my husband, still.
-[Judy] He's your husband.

13:29.667 --> 13:34.000
Forget what her daughter contributes,
what your husband contributes.

13:34.066 --> 13:38.633
I'm asking you where
she has lots of money.

13:38.700 --> 13:44.200
She gets, according to what I have here,
$989 a month. Is that right?

13:44.266 --> 13:47.100
-Mm-hm.
-$989 a month from Disability.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.166
You have to buy clothes.
Do you have a car?

13:49.233 --> 13:50.600
-Yes.
-[Judy] You have a car,

13:50.667 --> 13:52.166
you have to pay insurance,
you have other things.

13:52.233 --> 13:55.734
Where is this lots of money coming from?
You're the only one who's working.

13:55.800 --> 13:56.700
-She is--
-[Judy] I mean, the fact

13:56.767 --> 14:00.100
that you're getting the same
amount of money for not working

14:00.166 --> 14:01.900
as you did when you were working

14:01.967 --> 14:04.166
means that there's something wrong
with the government,

14:04.233 --> 14:07.166
which is why nobody [laughing]
can get anything done

14:07.233 --> 14:10.433
around this country now. Because everybody
says, "What do I have to work for?

14:10.500 --> 14:14.633
I can stay home. I can be a homemaker
when I'm 26 years old, for myself."

14:14.700 --> 14:15.633
[exhales sharply]

14:15.700 --> 14:17.166
[theme music playing]

14:17.233 --> 14:19.233
-I understand she's a kid.
-I trusted her.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.633
You know, she's a kid with four children,
which suggests to you

14:21.700 --> 14:24.433
that there's a certain
irresponsibility there to begin with.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.900
I trusted my daughter.
She was working, she was doing good--

14:27.967 --> 14:29.633
Well, you were a poor judge of character,

14:29.700 --> 14:31.066
-because she soon stopped working.
-I know.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.467
[theme music playing]

14:40.800 --> 14:44.567
[narrator] <i>Viola Hires</i>
<i>is accusing her daughter, Annalise Araujo,</i>

14:44.633 --> 14:49.567
<i>for not reimbursing her for the cost</i>
<i>of Annalise's tummy tuck surgery.</i>

14:49.633 --> 14:52.100
-How much is owed on the credit card?
-The credit card

14:52.166 --> 14:53.633
-is owed--
-[Judy] May I see it?

14:53.700 --> 14:55.600
-[Viola] Yes.
-Kevin, would you get that for me, please?

14:55.667 --> 14:56.967
[Kevin] Ma'am?

14:58.467 --> 14:59.500
Here's where--

14:59.567 --> 15:02.533
You understand, Miss Hires, that I think
it was a very foolish thing for you to do.

15:02.600 --> 15:03.967
Yes, I understand that.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.100
To commit yourself, you know--

15:06.166 --> 15:08.567
-I understand she's a kid.
-[Viola] I trusted my daughter.

15:08.633 --> 15:10.233
-I trusted her.
-You know, she's a kid with four children,

15:10.300 --> 15:11.867
which suggests to you

15:11.934 --> 15:14.867
that there's a certain irresponsibility
there to begin with.

15:14.934 --> 15:17.934
I trusted my daughter. She was working,
she was doing good--

15:18.000 --> 15:19.967
Well, you were a poor judge of character,

15:20.033 --> 15:21.533
because she soon she stopped working.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.200
-[Viola] I know.
-What is this?

15:23.266 --> 15:26.367
[Viola] That's the statement
of how much she paid,

15:26.433 --> 15:29.033
and how much I have paid with interest--

15:29.100 --> 15:31.967
[Judy] Just a second.
How many months did you pay?

15:32.033 --> 15:35.734
She paid four months and
I paid from February to current.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.433
You paid in October, November,
December and January.

15:38.500 --> 15:42.767
So you paid, according to this,
during the time you were still working.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.700
-I never paid her.
-[Viola] I have proof--

15:44.767 --> 15:47.967
Now, just a second.
Did you pay the credit card company?

15:48.033 --> 15:50.700
I didn't pay the credit card company.
I never got the bill.

15:50.767 --> 15:52.800
I never received anything.
It all went to her.

15:52.867 --> 15:54.467
-So-- It all went to who?
-Her.

15:54.533 --> 15:57.867
Well, I'm asking you.
She says you made four payments.

15:57.934 --> 16:00.300
-I never made a payment.
-You never gave her any money?

16:00.367 --> 16:02.433
No, I never gave her money
for a tummy tuck.

16:02.967 --> 16:05.600
Just a second.
What did you give her money for

16:05.667 --> 16:08.967
in October, November,
December and January?

16:09.033 --> 16:10.200
I've given her money before--

16:10.266 --> 16:14.367
Shh-shh! What did you
give her money for in October,

16:14.433 --> 16:17.300
November, December and January?

16:17.367 --> 16:21.467
You stopped working in February of 2021.
While you were working,

16:21.533 --> 16:25.400
what did you give her money for?
You moved out in October.

16:25.467 --> 16:28.633
You gave her money in October,
the next month,

16:28.700 --> 16:31.300
the month after that and
the month after that.

16:31.367 --> 16:33.200
So my question to you is,

16:33.266 --> 16:37.200
what did you give her money for
when you were out of the house?

16:37.266 --> 16:38.900
I never gave her money for anything

16:38.967 --> 16:41.233
besides a car payment
that we have together, that's it.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.600
Oh, just a second.
What car payment do you have together?

16:44.667 --> 16:46.667
-We have a car payment--
-[Judy] Just a sec--

16:47.867 --> 16:51.033
What car payment do you have together?

16:51.100 --> 16:53.533
-A ch-car payment?
-What car?

16:53.600 --> 16:56.100
-A Chevy Tahoe.
-What year?

16:56.166 --> 16:58.800
-A 2018.
-In whose name is the car?

16:58.867 --> 16:59.967
[Annalise] In mine and hers.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.300
-Who drives the car?
-I do.

17:02.367 --> 17:04.400
-So it's your car?
-Yes.

17:04.467 --> 17:07.700
How much do you give her
for your car?

17:07.767 --> 17:09.567
I give her $600.

17:09.633 --> 17:13.633
Six hundred dollars a what?
A month? A week?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.033
-Every two weeks?
-A month.

17:15.100 --> 17:18.166
So, you give her $600 a month for the car.

17:18.233 --> 17:21.567
-Yes.
-Okay. You have the records on the car?

17:21.633 --> 17:23.967
Yes. As far as--
-[Judy] Just a-- Bup!

17:24.033 --> 17:25.900
I'm ten steps ahead of you.

17:26.767 --> 17:29.533
-You own a car that's in both your names.
-Yes.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.800
So, you co-signed a car for her in 2018.

17:32.867 --> 17:35.066
-Yes.
-How much is left on the car?

17:35.133 --> 17:39.200
It was, I believe, 2019,
and it's $32,000.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.834
-And you signed that for her?
-Yes.

17:41.900 --> 17:44.133
And how much does
she pay you every month?

17:44.200 --> 17:45.700
It comes out of her bank account,

17:45.767 --> 17:48.767
so it doesn't come directly to me
for the car payment.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.667
How much is the car payment?

17:50.734 --> 17:53.233
$594.25, around there.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.834
-So it comes right out of her bank?
-Uh-huh. Yes.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.400
-Goes right to the car company.
-Yes.

17:57.467 --> 17:58.734
-Would that be correct?

17:58.800 --> 18:02.100
-There's times that it doesn't.
-[laughs]

18:02.166 --> 18:04.767
Because she hasn't paid
for about three, four months.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.266
They're gonna invest--
They'll come and take the car,

18:07.333 --> 18:08.567
and then you're gonna get stuck with it.

18:08.633 --> 18:11.100
-Not the way she did it.
-[Judy] Okay, just a second.

18:11.166 --> 18:12.734
[reading to self]

18:12.800 --> 18:14.633
Care Credit, what is Care Credit?

18:14.700 --> 18:17.000
Is that where you had
this surgical procedure?

18:17.066 --> 18:19.166
It's the name of the company.

18:19.233 --> 18:20.533
[sighs heavily]

18:20.600 --> 18:21.934
You do understand

18:22.000 --> 18:24.500
there's no way that she's gonna
keep up the payments on this car.

18:24.567 --> 18:28.734
She has, because she's had--
Two times, she did two months

18:28.800 --> 18:31.166
where she didn't pay,
she did a deferment.

18:31.233 --> 18:35.033
The third time, she did through insurance
because she's not working,

18:35.100 --> 18:37.600
so they paid it.
'Cause I called the bank to make sure.

18:37.667 --> 18:40.533
And as far as the tummy tuck, she had--

18:40.600 --> 18:41.767
-[Judy] Don't--
-Oh, sorry.

18:41.834 --> 18:44.000
-I'm asking you about the car.
-[Viola] Yes. Yes, I understand.

18:44.066 --> 18:45.734
[Judy] Yeah, well,
she likes to have a car.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.066
She needs a car, she's a homemaker.

18:47.133 --> 18:48.500
-Because she had kids--
-[audience laughs]

18:48.567 --> 18:49.867
-She's a homemaker. Yeah.
-And her husband said he would

18:49.934 --> 18:52.800
take over the payment
'cause he has the kids.

18:52.867 --> 18:55.700
Judging for the Plaintiff
in the amount of $7,000.

18:55.767 --> 18:56.834
We're done here.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.166
[theme music playing]

19:00.967 --> 19:04.867
I'm happy with the decision.
She knew right away what's going on

19:04.934 --> 19:07.767
and how my daughter--
She's lying, of course.

19:07.834 --> 19:11.867
Why would I pay that for her?
I woulda got it for myself, instead.

19:11.934 --> 19:15.667
I mean, she needs somebody
to pay her bills, so I don't blame her.

19:15.734 --> 19:19.467
My daughter cried to me and
I felt sorry for her, so of course,

19:19.533 --> 19:23.700
any mother is gonna do for their child,
just as my grandchildren, I do for them.

19:23.767 --> 19:25.800
My mom and I were very close,
at one point,

19:25.867 --> 19:29.333
and she was willing to do anything for me.
She co-signed a car for me, I mean...

19:29.400 --> 19:34.200
She complained and cried that
she needed a car for all her kids,

19:34.266 --> 19:37.667
and so there I go, like a mother,
wanting to help my daughter...

19:37.734 --> 19:41.600
For the sake of her grandchildren,
I mean, not on my time.

19:41.667 --> 19:46.567
I'm not gonna let her sign for anything.
If she needed food for herself,

19:46.633 --> 19:49.100
of course, I'm gonna help her,
she's still my daughter.

19:49.166 --> 19:52.467
I don't... wish or hope
for anything to happen.

19:52.533 --> 19:57.233
But as far as money-wise, for a car,
whatever she wants, that's a no-no.

19:57.934 --> 20:01.633
So the Defendant and I, in that
last case, are practically the same age,

20:01.700 --> 20:05.800
and I couldn't imagine trying
to prioritize yourself that young

20:05.867 --> 20:08.200
-with four children at such a young age.
-[chuckles]

20:08.266 --> 20:11.700
So that must be difficult,
but priorities are always key.

20:11.767 --> 20:14.467
What do you think people
are to do in that situation?

20:14.533 --> 20:17.734
Well, I think you're supposed
to think with your brain

20:17.800 --> 20:20.767
before you have a bunch of kids that--
It looks to me

20:20.834 --> 20:24.033
as if they're scattered around.
One child with one father

20:24.100 --> 20:27.433
and three with the father,
but she has them one day a week.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.867
And she's not working
and has a new boyfriend.

20:30.934 --> 20:33.467
For some reason, the mother
doesn't like the new boyfriend, which...

20:33.533 --> 20:37.700
You have young children and somebody
who is a new romance in your life.

20:37.767 --> 20:39.700
She's 26 years old.
The whole idea is,

20:39.767 --> 20:42.700
people really have to act
responsibly and reasonably.

20:42.767 --> 20:47.800
And, you know, my experience tells me
that usually the children,

20:47.867 --> 20:50.834
who are the innocents, always suffer

20:50.900 --> 20:53.900
when supposed adults
make bad decisions.

20:53.967 --> 20:55.700
That's what I learned in Family Court.

20:55.767 --> 20:58.133
They're always the byproduct
of bad decisions.

20:58.200 --> 21:03.300
So before you decide to have kids,
make sure you're emotionally

21:03.367 --> 21:06.066
and financially and physically
able to take care of them.

21:06.133 --> 21:08.633
Otherwise, there is
a substantial possibility

21:08.700 --> 21:12.133
that they're going to be neglected.
And that's sad and unfair.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.000
-Mm.
-That's what I think.
