00:04.120 --> 00:07.960
<b>Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...</b>

00:09.120 --> 00:12.480
<b>Vast riches... Hidden treasures...</b>

00:14.670 --> 00:18.530
<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.140 --> 00:23.250
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.250 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.790 --> 00:29.290
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.420 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:55.390 --> 01:56.300
<b>Now!</b>

02:05.580 --> 02:08.390
<b>Now you've experienced the joy 
of discovering</b>

02:08.390 --> 02:11.020
<b>how good something can taste.</b>

02:11.630 --> 02:14.270
<b>We're risking our lives for that joy.</b>

02:16.530 --> 02:21.530
<b>Showdown x On The x Airship</b>

02:26.690 --> 02:29.560
<b>After clearing the exam's Second Phase,</b>

02:29.560 --> 02:32.710
<b>Gon and his friends fly through the starry sky,</b>

02:32.710 --> 02:35.050
<b>toward the site for the Third Phase.</b>

02:35.750 --> 02:41.300
<b>Allow me to introduce myself to the 
forty-two remaining applicants.</b>

02:41.300 --> 02:48.220
<b>I am Netero, Chairman of this year's 
Hunter Exam Selection Committee.</b>

02:48.220 --> 02:49.810
<b>I am his secretary, Beans.</b>

02:50.410 --> 02:54.860
<b>Originally, I'd planned to 
make my appearance</b>

02:54.860 --> 02:58.070
<b>during the exam's final phase, 
but as I'm already here...</b>

03:03.480 --> 03:08.290
<b>I'm loving this tension in the air!</b>

03:08.710 --> 03:12.290
<b>So I think I'll stick around for 
the rest of the trip.</b>

03:14.430 --> 03:16.500
<b>We are scheduled to arrive</b>

03:16.500 --> 03:19.130
<b>at our destination 
tomorrow morning, at 8 AM.</b>

03:19.130 --> 03:22.260
<b>You'll find dinner waiting in the dining hall.</b>

03:22.260 --> 03:24.800
<b>You are also welcome to get some rest.</b>

03:25.420 --> 03:26.950
<b>In other words,</b>

03:26.950 --> 03:29.810
<b>you're free to do as you please 
until you are contacted.</b>

03:30.340 --> 03:33.200
<b>Okay, Gon! Let's explore the airship!</b>

03:33.200 --> 03:34.420
<b>Yeah!</b>

03:34.420 --> 03:36.510
<b>How can they have so much energy?</b>

03:36.510 --> 03:39.000
<b>I'm hitting the sack.</b>

03:39.000 --> 03:40.320
<b>You can say that again.</b>

03:40.990 --> 03:44.570
<b>However, I do have one concern...</b>

03:44.570 --> 03:46.420
<b>Hmm? What's up?</b>

03:46.420 --> 03:49.350
<b>How many more phases are there?</b>

03:49.350 --> 03:49.980
<b>Oh...</b>

03:49.980 --> 03:52.080
<b>They've never mentioned that, 
have they?</b>

03:52.700 --> 03:55.710
<b>On average, there are five to six phases.</b>

03:56.390 --> 04:00.050
<b>Which means we still have 
three or four to go...</b>

04:00.600 --> 04:03.890
<b>All the more reason to rest now.</b>

04:04.720 --> 04:07.470
<b>But you should be careful.</b>

04:08.350 --> 04:08.970
<b>Huh?</b>

04:08.970 --> 04:13.550
<b>The secretary only told us when 
we'll arrive at our destination.</b>

04:13.550 --> 04:16.100
<b>It's possible that the third exam could</b>

04:16.100 --> 04:18.940
<b>take place on this airship itself.</b>

04:18.940 --> 04:22.610
<b>And it doesn't necessarily mean we'll 
be contacted at 8 AM.</b>

04:22.820 --> 04:24.630
<b>Huh? Are you serious?</b>

04:24.630 --> 04:26.700
<b>Hmm, that does make sense...</b>

04:26.700 --> 04:31.580
<b>You might wake up to discover that 
the exam has already ended.</b>

04:32.150 --> 04:35.330
<b>If you plan to make it to the next phase,</b>

04:35.330 --> 04:37.840
<b>don't let yourself relax on this airship.</b>

04:38.480 --> 04:40.200
<b>What the hell...</b>

04:40.200 --> 04:42.060
<b>Well, that was some good advice.</b>

04:42.060 --> 04:43.240
<b>Thanks.</b>

04:43.240 --> 04:45.090
<b>We shall bear that in mind.</b>

04:45.090 --> 04:47.330
<b>Let's all do our best.</b>

04:49.190 --> 04:50.650
<b><i>Yeah, right...</i></b>

04:50.650 --> 04:53.560
<b><i>Here's hoping that you're 
both nervous wrecks,</i></b>

04:53.560 --> 04:55.100
<b><i>come the morning.</i></b>

04:57.780 --> 05:01.110
<b><i>There's no chance that the next phase 
will be held on the airship.</i></b>

05:01.620 --> 05:04.190
<b><i>Were that their intention,</i></b>

05:04.190 --> 05:07.600
<b><i>they wouldn't have said that we were 
free to do as we pleased.</i></b>

05:07.600 --> 05:09.700
<b><i>They would have told us to stand by.</i></b>

05:17.350 --> 05:20.290
<b>Hey, how many applicants 
do you expect to make it?</b>

05:20.290 --> 05:22.190
<b>You mean pass the exam?</b>

05:22.190 --> 05:25.920
<b>Yep. This year, we have 
an impressive group.</b>

05:25.920 --> 05:28.970
<b>Though I did fail them all at one point...</b>

05:28.970 --> 05:30.590
<b>But doesn't it depend</b>

05:30.590 --> 05:33.160
<b>on what the upcoming phases consist of?</b>

05:33.160 --> 05:35.730
<b>That's true...</b>

05:35.730 --> 05:38.310
<b>But didn't you notice it?</b>

05:38.310 --> 05:41.070
<b>One of them had this whole 
aura thing going on.</b>

05:41.730 --> 05:43.230
<b>What do you think, Satotz?</b>

05:44.240 --> 05:45.680
<b>Oh, yes.</b>

05:46.890 --> 05:49.240
<b>I like the rookies this year.</b>

05:49.530 --> 05:51.230
<b>Ha! So you agree?</b>

05:51.230 --> 05:54.730
<b>I think #294 has a good shot.</b>

05:55.210 --> 05:58.360
<b>I'm partial to #99.</b>

05:58.360 --> 06:01.300
<b>He looks like a selfish, spoiled brat.</b>

06:01.300 --> 06:02.280
<b>What do you think, Buhara?</b>

06:03.050 --> 06:04.900
<b>Well...</b>

06:04.900 --> 06:08.010
<b>He isn't a rookie, 
but #44 is the one I favor.</b>

06:09.300 --> 06:11.800
<b>I'm sure you noticed,</b>

06:11.800 --> 06:15.220
<b>but when #255 was throwing a fit,</b>

06:15.840 --> 06:21.650
<b>it was #44 who was really on the verge 
of killing someone.</b>

06:22.170 --> 06:24.200
<b>I did notice that, of course.</b>

06:24.200 --> 06:27.530
<b>He could barely restrain himself 
from tearing off our heads.</b>

06:28.540 --> 06:30.320
<b>But didn't you realize?</b>

06:30.320 --> 06:32.850
<b>He was already that way</b>

06:32.850 --> 06:36.120
<b>from the first moment we appeared.</b>

06:36.120 --> 06:37.160
<b>Really?</b>

06:37.760 --> 06:41.400
<b>Yeah, that's the real reason 
I was so edgy.</b>

06:41.400 --> 06:44.670
<b>He kept challenging me.</b>

06:45.760 --> 06:47.470
<b>I had a similar experience.</b>

06:48.100 --> 06:50.180
<b>He should be carefully monitored.</b>

06:50.770 --> 06:53.260
<b>Though it pains me to admit this,</b>

06:53.260 --> 06:56.050
<b>we are birds of a feather with him.</b>

06:57.540 --> 07:02.060
<b>However, his affinity 
for darkness is far stronger.</b>

07:04.710 --> 07:09.670
<b>As Hunters, we are continually 
seeking out rivals.</b>

07:09.670 --> 07:13.350
<b>Ultimately, the Hunter Exam</b>

07:13.350 --> 07:17.040
<b>is but a place to find opponents 
worthy of respect.</b>

07:18.770 --> 07:22.240
<b>And every once in a while, we encounter</b>

07:22.830 --> 07:25.360
<b>someone who hits the floor running,</b>

07:25.360 --> 07:28.170
<b>when we try to slow things down.</b>

07:28.920 --> 07:30.710
<b>An oddball of sorts.</b>

08:07.280 --> 08:09.010
<b>Hey, there! Kids!</b>

08:09.010 --> 08:10.890
<b>Stay out of the kitchen!</b>

08:10.890 --> 08:12.660
<b>Go eat in the dining hall!</b>

08:16.880 --> 08:18.660
<b>Wow, awesome!</b>

08:18.660 --> 08:19.530
<b>Look, Gon!</b>

08:19.530 --> 08:20.770
<b>Hmm? What is it?</b>

08:21.540 --> 08:22.770
<b>Whoa!</b>

08:22.770 --> 08:24.830
<b>It's like the ground is covered in jewels!</b>

08:24.830 --> 08:25.770
<b>Yeah!</b>

08:27.780 --> 08:30.090
<b>Hey, I was wondering...</b>

08:30.880 --> 08:31.880
<b>Hmm?</b>

08:33.520 --> 08:36.880
<b>Where are your mom and dad?</b>

08:37.510 --> 08:39.840
<b>Hmm... They're alive.</b>

08:39.840 --> 08:40.680
<b>Probably.</b>

08:40.680 --> 08:42.360
<b>What do they do?</b>

08:42.360 --> 08:43.790
<b>They're assassins.</b>

08:44.190 --> 08:46.290
<b>Huh? Both of them?</b>

08:48.290 --> 08:49.980
<b>That's your first reaction?</b>

08:50.660 --> 08:53.120
<b>You really are a riot!</b>

08:53.120 --> 08:54.050
<b>Huh?</b>

08:55.150 --> 08:59.630
<b>You're the first person who's 
ever responded seriously.</b>

08:59.630 --> 09:01.560
<b>Well, you're telling the truth, right?</b>

09:02.190 --> 09:03.560
<b>What makes you think that?</b>

09:03.910 --> 09:05.530
<b>It's just a hunch.</b>

09:05.530 --> 09:07.470
<b>That's weird...</b>

09:07.470 --> 09:09.810
<b>People only like me</b>

09:09.810 --> 09:11.960
<b>because they can't ever tell 
whether I'm serious.</b>

09:14.430 --> 09:17.420
<b>I'm from a family of assassins.</b>

09:17.420 --> 09:18.860
<b>So they're all assassins.</b>

09:19.910 --> 09:22.150
<b>And my family has</b>

09:22.150 --> 09:24.360
<b>really high hopes for me...</b>

09:25.040 --> 09:27.650
<b>But I can't stand it.</b>

09:28.330 --> 09:31.090
<b>Who wants to have their life 
planned out for them?</b>

09:31.560 --> 09:34.030
<b>When I told them I wanted to 
decide my own future,</b>

09:34.030 --> 09:36.400
<b>they all snapped!</b>

09:36.400 --> 09:37.720
<b>My mother had tears</b>

09:37.720 --> 09:40.410
<b>streaming down her face, as she told me</b>

09:40.410 --> 09:42.520
<b>I have the potential to be a top assassin.</b>

09:43.520 --> 09:44.920
<b>Horrible parents, right?</b>

09:44.920 --> 09:46.550
<b>It's natural their kid would go bad.</b>

09:46.550 --> 09:48.070
<b>We ended up fighting.</b>

09:48.070 --> 09:49.560
<b>So I stabbed my mother in the face,</b>

09:49.560 --> 09:51.020
<b>my brother in the side,</b>

09:51.020 --> 09:52.630
<b>and ran away from home.</b>

09:52.630 --> 09:54.850
<b>I'm sure they're out for blood now.</b>

09:54.850 --> 09:56.540
<b>But if they find me, 
I'll send them packing.</b>

09:57.620 --> 09:59.060
<b>When I become a Hunter,</b>

09:59.060 --> 10:01.620
<b>I'll start by capturing my family.</b>

10:01.620 --> 10:05.580
<b>I'm sure they're worth some 
hefty bounties...</b>

10:17.130 --> 10:18.720
<b>Something wrong?</b>

10:26.360 --> 10:28.560
<b>Ah, Netero-san...</b>

10:28.560 --> 10:29.730
<b>Did you see anyone</b>

10:29.730 --> 10:31.510
<b>coming from that side?</b>

10:31.870 --> 10:32.730
<b>No.</b>

10:33.700 --> 10:35.230
<b><i>When did he...</i></b>

10:35.620 --> 10:37.810
<b>You're pretty fast for an old man.</b>

10:37.810 --> 10:39.540
<b>That little trick?</b>

10:39.540 --> 10:41.490
<b>I barely moved.</b>

10:45.490 --> 10:47.020
<b>What do you want?</b>

10:47.020 --> 10:48.710
<b>You don't have to do anything</b>

10:48.710 --> 10:50.250
<b>until the last phase, right?</b>

10:50.250 --> 10:52.940
<b>No need to be so unkind.</b>

10:52.940 --> 10:56.510
<b>I got bored, and was looking 
for some companions.</b>

10:57.450 --> 11:00.160
<b>By the way, I meant to ask 
the two of you...</b>

11:00.160 --> 11:03.010
<b>Any thoughts on your first attempt 
at the Hunter Examination?</b>

11:03.510 --> 11:05.240
<b>Uh-huh! It's fun!</b>

11:05.240 --> 11:09.300
<b>And there haven't been any of the 
written exams I was dreading.</b>

11:09.990 --> 11:12.130
<b>I'm disappointed...</b>

11:12.130 --> 11:14.760
<b>I expected the exam to be 
far more difficult.</b>

11:15.670 --> 11:19.030
<b>I assume the next phase will 
be more entertaining?</b>

11:19.030 --> 11:21.030
<b>Well, now... 
I wouldn't know about that.</b>

11:22.220 --> 11:23.630
<b>Let's go, Gon!</b>

11:23.630 --> 11:25.430
<b>Now wait just a moment.</b>

11:26.060 --> 11:29.040
<b>Would you care to play a game with me?</b>

11:31.290 --> 11:32.290
<b>A game?</b>

11:33.050 --> 11:37.800
<b>If you're able to defeat me, 
I shall let you be Hunters!</b>

11:38.080 --> 11:40.050
<b>Really? I'll play!</b>

11:43.820 --> 11:46.190
<b>How about it, eh?</b>

11:47.060 --> 11:57.150
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

11:52.980 --> 11:57.150
<b>Netero</b>

12:05.000 --> 12:07.810
<b>Now, I'll go over the rules of the game.</b>

12:07.810 --> 12:11.090
<b>If you can take this ball from me,</b>

12:11.090 --> 12:15.250
<b>before the airship reaches 
its destination, you win.</b>

12:15.980 --> 12:19.760
<b>I believe that we're scheduled 
for an 8 AM arrival?</b>

12:20.520 --> 12:24.030
<b>Well, that still gives you nine hours.</b>

12:24.030 --> 12:26.760
<b>You're free to attack me 
however you'd like.</b>

12:26.760 --> 12:29.450
<b>I won't touch you.</b>

12:29.450 --> 12:31.810
<b>Huh? That's too easy.</b>

12:31.810 --> 12:33.390
<b>You can't call that a game.</b>

12:34.000 --> 12:36.400
<b>Why not give it a try first?</b>

12:37.590 --> 12:39.400
<b>We just have to take the ball?</b>

12:39.400 --> 12:40.400
<b>Yeah.</b>

12:40.940 --> 12:42.650
<b>Then I'll go first.</b>

12:43.280 --> 12:44.660
<b>Go ahead.</b>

12:50.300 --> 12:51.410
<b><i>He's looking down on me.</i></b>

13:06.740 --> 13:08.430
<b>I see lots of Killuas!</b>

13:10.400 --> 13:13.430
<b><i>This is an assassination technique.</i></b>

13:14.670 --> 13:15.690
<b><i>Rhythm Echo...</i></b>

13:16.360 --> 13:20.240
<b><i>Practitioners use a certain rhythm 
to create after-images,</i></b>

13:20.240 --> 13:22.190
<b><i>confusing the enemy.</i></b>

13:25.220 --> 13:28.130
<b><i>I am astonished that such a young child</i></b>

13:28.130 --> 13:30.200
<b><i>has already mastered that technique.</i></b>

13:52.260 --> 13:53.850
<b><i>Damn, he keeps darting around.</i></b>

13:53.850 --> 13:55.100
<b><i>Is he really an old man?</i></b>

13:55.490 --> 13:57.860
<b>What? That's it?</b>

13:59.950 --> 14:01.370
<b><i>In that case,</i></b>

14:01.980 --> 14:03.730
<b><i>I'll stop his movement!</i></b>

14:08.080 --> 14:09.740
<b>Ouch... Right on his pivot leg!</b>

14:15.250 --> 14:18.520
<b>Ow!</b>

14:19.550 --> 14:22.630
<b><i>He didn't hold back with that kick.</i></b>

14:22.630 --> 14:26.260
<b><i>If I were an ordinary person, 
that would have shattered my leg.</i></b>

14:26.700 --> 14:28.190
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

14:28.190 --> 14:30.890
<b><i>His legs are hard as iron...</i></b>

14:30.890 --> 14:31.990
<b>Killua!</b>

14:31.990 --> 14:33.150
<b>Tag! Tag!</b>

14:33.150 --> 14:34.520
<b>It's my turn!</b>

14:37.540 --> 14:40.970
<b><i>What will this kid try?</i></b>

14:40.970 --> 14:43.400
<b><i>He appears to be a very honest boy.</i></b>

14:44.190 --> 14:45.150
<b>Okay!</b>

14:52.660 --> 14:56.220
<b><i>Oh... He has a quick first step.</i></b>

14:56.720 --> 14:59.060
<b><i>But he'd need another ten years</i></b>

14:59.060 --> 15:00.290
<b><i>before attacking me head-on.</i></b>

15:00.770 --> 15:02.210
<b><i>I guess he is just a child.</i></b>

15:03.080 --> 15:04.450
<b><i>Huh? From above?</i></b>

15:07.590 --> 15:09.580
<b>Ow!</b>

15:09.580 --> 15:10.340
<b>Idiot!</b>

15:10.790 --> 15:12.990
<b>We know that you can jump 
really high!</b>

15:12.990 --> 15:15.170
<b>Control your strength!</b>

15:15.170 --> 15:17.720
<b>For a moment, the old man 
relaxed his guard!</b>

15:17.720 --> 15:19.350
<b><i>No kidding...</i></b>

15:23.700 --> 15:27.860
<b><i>He may appear simple-minded, 
but he clearly uses his head.</i></b>

15:28.160 --> 15:29.610
<b>I messed up there.</b>

15:31.060 --> 15:34.120
<b><i>They should keep me entertained 
until the morning.</i></b>

15:46.100 --> 15:49.630
<b><i>Those two were pretty shaken.</i></b>

15:50.620 --> 15:52.590
<b><i>I bet they're too nervous</i></b>

15:52.590 --> 15:55.320
<b><i>to get a wink of sleep...</i></b>

15:55.320 --> 15:57.140
<b><i>They're sound asleep?</i></b>

16:12.530 --> 16:15.150
<b>You boys aren't getting anywhere.</b>

16:15.150 --> 16:17.760
<b>Why not attack simultaneously?</b>

16:18.330 --> 16:19.700
<b>Why, you...</b>

16:20.300 --> 16:22.460
<b>Okay... I'll get you this time!</b>

16:25.560 --> 16:27.290
<b>Here they come.</b>

16:32.740 --> 16:35.550
<b><i>Netero-san hasn't even broken a sweat.</i></b>

16:38.430 --> 16:39.350
<b>Ow!</b>

16:42.360 --> 16:44.940
<b><i>So we can't beat him 
without subterfuge.</i></b>

16:48.450 --> 16:51.150
<b>Your attacks are getting boring.</b>

16:55.200 --> 16:59.080
<b><i>He kicked off his shoe to 
increase his range?</i></b>

17:03.780 --> 17:04.710
<b>A chance!</b>

17:04.920 --> 17:06.010
<b>I think not.</b>

17:11.370 --> 17:13.090
<b>You and your little tricks!</b>

17:14.790 --> 17:16.770
<b>It's mine!</b>

17:34.060 --> 17:36.860
<b>I commend you on your efforts.</b>

17:38.870 --> 17:40.870
<b>You're amazing, Netero-san!</b>

17:40.870 --> 17:42.230
<b>Really amazing!</b>

17:50.540 --> 17:51.870
<b>Forget it...</b>

17:51.870 --> 17:52.790
<b>I give up.</b>

17:52.790 --> 17:54.130
<b>I lose!</b>

17:54.130 --> 17:54.820
<b>Huh?</b>

17:54.820 --> 17:56.880
<b><i>Oh? He's quitting?</i></b>

17:57.440 --> 17:59.890
<b>Why? We still have time.</b>

18:00.340 --> 18:02.890
<b>And just now, we came really close.</b>

18:03.500 --> 18:07.390
<b>Jeez. You really have no clue, do you?</b>

18:08.270 --> 18:12.470
<b>The old man has barely used his 
right hand and his left leg.</b>

18:12.470 --> 18:13.030
<b>What?</b>

18:13.500 --> 18:15.820
<b>But we're still powerless against him.</b>

18:15.820 --> 18:18.200
<b>We could chase him around for a year,</b>

18:18.200 --> 18:19.740
<b>and never take the ball from him.</b>

18:21.120 --> 18:22.940
<b>Oh, you figured it out?</b>

18:22.940 --> 18:25.660
<b>And here, I thought I'd fooled you.</b>

18:26.040 --> 18:27.530
<b>So that's what he was doing.</b>

18:28.700 --> 18:31.020
<b>You really know how to 
piss me off, old man.</b>

18:31.020 --> 18:32.590
<b>Let's go, Gon!</b>

18:32.590 --> 18:34.650
<b>Oh, I'm gonna play a little longer.</b>

18:34.650 --> 18:35.170
<b>Huh?</b>

18:35.590 --> 18:37.910
<b>Didn't you hear what I said?!</b>

18:37.910 --> 18:38.620
<b>It's useless!</b>

18:38.620 --> 18:40.920
<b>You won't be able to take 
the ball from him!</b>

18:40.920 --> 18:43.180
<b>Yeah! I don't care about the ball.</b>

18:43.680 --> 18:46.060
<b>We've only used up half 
of the time limit.</b>

18:46.060 --> 18:48.320
<b>I'm gonna make Netero-san 
use his right hand</b>

18:48.320 --> 18:49.560
<b>before the time runs out.</b>

18:52.120 --> 18:53.820
<b>I see...</b>

18:54.520 --> 18:56.250
<b>Yeah, I got it.</b>

18:56.250 --> 18:57.450
<b>Good luck.</b>

18:58.160 --> 18:59.710
<b>I'm getting some sleep.</b>

19:03.380 --> 19:04.950
<b>Say, Netero-san...</b>

19:04.950 --> 19:05.840
<b>Hmm?</b>

19:05.840 --> 19:08.410
<b>How did Killua do that thing 
where he walked slowly,</b>

19:08.410 --> 19:11.400
<b>and it looked like there were 
a bunch of Killuas?</b>

19:12.620 --> 19:17.780
<b>That technique is for those engaged 
in underground work.</b>

19:17.780 --> 19:20.340
<b>You have no need to learn it.</b>

19:20.930 --> 19:23.380
<b>In fact, you should not learn it.</b>

19:23.380 --> 19:25.400
<b>But it's an amazing technique, right?</b>

19:26.030 --> 19:29.540
<b>It requires an intensive amount 
of training.</b>

19:29.540 --> 19:32.310
<b>Killua's really something!</b>

19:35.430 --> 19:36.820
<b>You fool.</b>

19:42.100 --> 19:44.870
<b><i>Damn it! Now I'm in a bad mood.</i></b>

19:46.030 --> 19:48.060
<b><i>Well, I guess there's 
nothing for it.</i></b>

19:48.500 --> 19:49.120
<b>Hey.</b>

19:49.120 --> 19:49.870
<b>Wait up, kid.</b>

19:51.080 --> 19:53.080
<b>You bump into us, 
and then ignore us?</b>

19:53.680 --> 19:55.300
<b>Bastard!</b>

20:00.090 --> 20:01.960
<b><i>If I hadn't stopped then,</i></b>

20:01.960 --> 20:06.390
<b><i>I'd have ended up killing that 
old man to get the ball.</i></b>

20:13.630 --> 20:18.110
<b><i>Oh, he's moving faster.</i></b>

20:20.670 --> 20:21.110
<b><i>Here it comes!</i></b>

20:22.100 --> 20:23.970
<b><i>He'll feint for the ball,</i></b>

20:23.970 --> 20:25.620
<b><i>but attack my stomach!</i></b>

20:27.620 --> 20:30.160
<b>O-Ouch!</b>

20:32.110 --> 20:33.620
<b>One more!</b>

20:35.880 --> 20:39.200
<b><i>If he head-butts me in the stomach again,</i></b>

20:39.200 --> 20:41.130
<b><i>he'll shatter his skull.</i></b>

20:41.770 --> 20:45.640
<b><i>But if I relax my stomach, 
I'll be the one suffering.</i></b>

20:47.970 --> 20:49.140
<b>I'll run away.</b>

20:53.770 --> 20:55.900
<b>Ah, is he dead?</b>

21:02.740 --> 21:04.410
<b>You just used your right hand!</b>

21:10.860 --> 21:12.660
<b>I did it!</b>

21:13.040 --> 21:16.420
<b>Hooray...</b>

21:28.130 --> 21:29.860
<b>Hello, helmsman?</b>

21:29.860 --> 21:32.300
<b>It's me. Is the flight going well?</b>

21:32.300 --> 21:33.590
<b>I see.</b>

21:33.590 --> 21:35.690
<b>I'm sorry to ruin it for you,</b>

21:36.480 --> 21:39.930
<b>but could you fly a little slower?</b>

21:43.690 --> 21:46.850
<b>During a game Netero proposed to kill time,</b>

21:46.850 --> 21:49.160
<b>he's seen something in Gon.</b>

21:50.380 --> 21:53.630
<b>The airship and its 42 applicants</b>

21:53.630 --> 21:58.670
<b>approach the site of the exam's Third Phase.</b>

23:27.420 --> 23:30.280
<b>Next time: Decision x By x Majority?</b>

23:30.280 --> 23:31.220
<b>Majority, majority...</b>

23:31.220 --> 23:32.510
<b>Authority!</b>

23:32.510 --> 23:34.200
<b>Minority?</b>
