01:34.300 --> 01:37.000
I was born in Hawaii to two
die-hard surfers.

01:37.429 --> 01:40.364
How could I not have
salt water in my veins?

01:41.867 --> 01:43.732
They say home is where the heart is.

01:43.836 --> 01:47.863
And for most people, that consists
of four walls and a welcome mat.

01:47.973 --> 01:50.567
But for me, it's the ocean.

01:50.642 --> 01:52.974
With the warmth of the sun on my skin.

02:03.322 --> 02:04.619
"Two brothers."

02:04.690 --> 02:08.420
That's my answer when anyone
asks me why I'm so competitive.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.767
And, of course,
there's my best friend Alana.

02:19.371 --> 02:20.463
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!

02:40.092 --> 02:42.652
We spent more time wet than we did dry.

02:42.728 --> 02:45.288
My mom was convinced
that we were mermaids.

02:49.668 --> 02:52.068
From the moment I caught my first wave,

02:52.137 --> 02:54.901
I knew that I wanted to be a pro surfer.

02:54.973 --> 02:56.304
Nothing else seemed to matter.

03:12.224 --> 03:14.658
Surfing is my passion, my way of life.

03:15.994 --> 03:19.395
The stoke I get from riding
a perfect wave is pure joy.

03:27.439 --> 03:30.169
But like my dad always says,
"Life is an adventure.

03:30.842 --> 03:34.471
"And sometimes, you wipe out and
end up in the impact zone."

03:39.685 --> 03:40.811
Bethany!

03:42.354 --> 03:43.616
Bethany!

03:44.122 --> 03:45.646
Let's go, you're lagging!

03:46.024 --> 03:47.753
I'm coming!

03:47.826 --> 03:50.454
Hey, sorry, Noah, I lost track of time!

04:10.816 --> 04:12.408
Glad you could join us.

04:12.484 --> 04:14.213
Move over, Timmy.
Sorry, this seat's saved.

04:14.286 --> 04:15.617
Come on.
Ow!

04:17.089 --> 04:18.784
How were the waves?
Really fun.

04:18.857 --> 04:20.688
Ready for the contest?
Yeah.

04:20.759 --> 04:22.021
Practice your snap off the lip?
Shh.

04:22.361 --> 04:24.124
No, but she's perfect on the wipeouts.

04:24.196 --> 04:25.993
Shh, guys, we're in church.

04:26.064 --> 04:27.429
She's going to do her mermaid thing

04:27.499 --> 04:30.332
and crush it like she always does.

05:31.263 --> 05:32.753
Almost got it.

05:34.132 --> 05:35.360
Darn it.

05:37.169 --> 05:39.194
Come on.

05:39.271 --> 05:42.934
Interesting technique, Noah.
Is that how the professionals do it?

05:43.008 --> 05:44.805
Hey, I know what I'm doing.

05:45.310 --> 05:46.709
Okay.

05:46.778 --> 05:48.541
Where you going?
To watch the competition.

06:07.532 --> 06:08.521
Whoa!

06:28.653 --> 06:30.382
They gave me a five!

06:30.856 --> 06:32.289
Not so bad for a girl.

06:42.534 --> 06:43.831
Oh!

06:48.940 --> 06:50.066
What!

06:51.410 --> 06:52.968
Read it and weep, honey.

06:53.044 --> 06:55.478
I'm not the one who's
going to be weeping.

06:57.616 --> 06:58.605
Five!

06:58.683 --> 06:59.809
Hey! Hey! Hey!

06:59.918 --> 07:01.010
Don't harass the judges!

07:01.086 --> 07:02.383
Hey! Hey! Hey!

07:03.622 --> 07:04.611
Hey!

07:06.558 --> 07:07.786
We're coming to get you!

07:12.764 --> 07:14.391
Babe, is it your knee again?

07:14.466 --> 07:15.455
Got you!

07:21.006 --> 07:22.474
Noah, put me down!

07:32.017 --> 07:34.110
Welcome, ladies and
gentlemen, to the junior portion

07:34.219 --> 07:37.086
of the Maui Jim Turtle Bay
Resort Invitational.

07:37.155 --> 07:39.385
We're expecting
a great competition today.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.221
We've got skateboarding on the half-pipe.

07:41.293 --> 07:42.954
We've got all the action in the water.

07:43.028 --> 07:44.427
Watch top amateur surf...

07:44.496 --> 07:45.485
Hey, howzit?

07:45.564 --> 07:46.724
Hey.
Hey, Keoki.

07:46.798 --> 07:48.265
If you get tired waiting
for the waves out there,

07:48.333 --> 07:49.960
you can always come and kick it with us.

07:50.035 --> 07:51.127
We don't have to wait for the action.

07:51.203 --> 07:53.364
Well, when you get tired of the
pipe, come surf some real waves.

07:53.538 --> 07:54.527
Ooh!

07:55.740 --> 07:57.230
Hey, Thursday night is a full moon.

07:57.309 --> 07:59.334
If you guys aren't doing anything,
we're all gonna go surfing.

07:59.411 --> 08:01.038
Yeah, if we don't have
anything better to do.

08:02.414 --> 08:04.780
Okay.
See you guys later.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.010
All right. Bye.
Bye.

08:10.622 --> 08:13.386
In semi-final heat number
one, we've got six competitors.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.289
In orange is Olivia Jenner.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.191
In black, Malina Birch.

08:17.262 --> 08:18.854
In blue, Bethany Hamilton.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.930
In yellow, Kaila Kahani.

08:21.032 --> 08:22.932
In white, Lalani Bri.

08:23.001 --> 08:24.764
And in pink, Alana Blanchard.

08:31.910 --> 08:35.004
And it looks like the local groms have
tracked down Hawaiian surfing legend,

08:35.080 --> 08:36.172
Ben Aipa.

08:37.148 --> 08:38.342
Yeah, Ben!

08:42.287 --> 08:44.585
Hey, you see that
sick air Keoki just got?

08:44.656 --> 08:45.645
I don't think so.

08:46.324 --> 08:47.313
What?

08:47.392 --> 08:48.381
You're not going
to distract me.

08:49.761 --> 08:51.160
I'm catching that next wave.

08:53.465 --> 08:55.365
I don't think they know
how not to compete.

08:55.433 --> 08:56.730
Holt, you didn't
tell them, did you?

08:56.801 --> 08:58.166
No, no. I didn't want
to make them nervous.

08:58.270 --> 09:00.067
I'm nervous enough for the
both of them, as it is.

09:00.138 --> 09:01.833
You know, they both
have to place.

09:01.907 --> 09:03.704
Black, Malina
Birch, you're in first.

09:03.975 --> 09:05.909
Blue, Bethany Hamilton,
you're in second

09:05.977 --> 09:08.411
looking for a 4.2
to overtake that top spot.

09:08.947 --> 09:10.608
Pink, Alana Blanchard,
you're in third,

09:10.682 --> 09:13.810
requiring a 5.4 to
overtake first place.

09:13.885 --> 09:15.477
Just a reminder,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.545
The winners of today's
contest will qualify

09:17.622 --> 09:19.385
for the Hawaiian
Island Regionals.

09:19.958 --> 09:22.654
Alana Blanchard finds the
cover to finish things off.

09:22.727 --> 09:24.092
Solid wave for pink.

09:24.229 --> 09:25.355
Yes!

09:25.997 --> 09:27.225
Looks like we have
a paddle-battle here.

09:27.532 --> 09:28.556
Go, Bethany! Go!

09:28.633 --> 09:32.000
It's blue and black scratching
for a solid set wave.

09:32.070 --> 09:34.664
Malina Birch taking the inside
off of Bethany Hamilton.

09:34.739 --> 09:37.367
Here she is, up and riding.

09:37.442 --> 09:40.206
Malina Birch kicks things
off with a very nice ride.

09:40.278 --> 09:42.371
And a strong carve off the top.

09:42.447 --> 09:44.381
She definitely knows what
the judges are looking for.

09:44.449 --> 09:46.110
That will be a solid
wave for black.

09:46.885 --> 09:49.547
Malina full on stole my
wave, I had position.

09:49.621 --> 09:53.113
It's okay, it's all right.
Look, next time, I want you to really focus

09:53.191 --> 09:55.182
on just diving into the
water as far as you can.

09:55.260 --> 09:56.488
Rip that paddle
back. Okay?

09:56.561 --> 09:57.550
Okay.

09:57.629 --> 09:58.755
All right, take a rest.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.156
You thirsty?
Yeah.

10:01.199 --> 10:03.167
With five minutes
remaining in this final,

10:03.268 --> 10:05.327
pink, Alana Blanchard,
you are in first.

10:05.403 --> 10:07.428
Black, Malina Birch,
you are in second.

10:07.505 --> 10:10.497
And blue, Bethany Hamilton,
you are currently in third.

10:10.575 --> 10:13.476
You're not breathing,
you know that, right?

10:19.184 --> 10:20.208
Go! Go!

10:28.793 --> 10:29.817
Yeah!

10:31.062 --> 10:32.586
Big snap off the top.

10:33.264 --> 10:35.494
She draws out
her second bottom turn,

10:35.567 --> 10:37.501
and hooks it one more time.

10:37.569 --> 10:39.969
Bethany Hamilton
is holding nothing back.

10:40.038 --> 10:42.529
Potentially one of the highest
scoring rides of the day.

10:42.741 --> 10:45.471
As this final comes to a
close here at Turtle Bay.

10:46.845 --> 10:49.678
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.

10:49.814 --> 10:52.180
You're doing a great job
training her, Brother Tom.

10:53.318 --> 10:54.307
Thanks, Ben.

10:54.386 --> 10:55.546
You got it, bro.

10:55.620 --> 10:56.917
Looks like she has
a real future.

10:57.355 --> 10:58.379
As a pro.

10:58.456 --> 11:00.321
She's been working so hard.

11:00.392 --> 11:02.383
Well, with her heart,
her will, she'll go far.

11:04.663 --> 11:09.123
Third place of the Turtle Bay
Juniors final goes to Alana Blanchard.

11:10.402 --> 11:12.632
In second place, Malina Birch.

11:13.505 --> 11:15.063
Good job, Malina.

11:15.140 --> 11:18.803
Meaning, taking first place
is Kauai's Bethany Hamilton.

11:18.877 --> 11:20.708
Bethany!
With today's big victory,

11:20.779 --> 11:23.179
Bethany Hamilton has to be
considered the favorite

11:23.248 --> 11:26.217
as we head to the
Hawaiian Island Regionals.

11:33.358 --> 11:34.518
Way to go, Bethany.

11:35.593 --> 11:39.051
Girls, there's some people down
there you might want to meet.

11:39.130 --> 11:40.119
Who?

11:40.198 --> 11:42.166
It's the guys from Rip
Curl, it's no big deal.

11:42.233 --> 11:44.167
They want to sponsor
both of you.

11:44.502 --> 11:45.628
No way!
What!

11:45.704 --> 11:47.501
Oh, my gosh!

11:52.310 --> 11:54.073
I got it, how about this one?

11:54.145 --> 11:56.045
Nice, if you're 100.

11:56.114 --> 11:57.103
Okay.

11:57.449 --> 11:58.473
What about this?

11:58.550 --> 11:59.539
Are you kidding?

12:00.151 --> 12:01.846
Thing looks like a eye patch.

12:04.789 --> 12:05.881
I think it's hot.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.090
One wipeout in that tiny thing,

12:08.159 --> 12:11.720
and you're going to be showing a
lot more than your sick rides.

12:11.796 --> 12:13.661
Ooh, so much for so little.

12:14.099 --> 12:15.657
Well, good thing
it's on Rip Curl.

12:15.767 --> 12:16.756
Yes!

12:18.236 --> 12:20.067
But make sure
to keep your eye on it,

12:20.138 --> 12:22.197
if you don't want it snaked
out from underneath you.

12:22.307 --> 12:23.672
Hey, girls.

12:23.942 --> 12:26.001
You realize I'm gonna take
you next time, right?

12:26.144 --> 12:27.873
Let's just let the
surfing do the talking.

12:29.414 --> 12:31.109
Every day between
now and regionals,

12:31.182 --> 12:32.774
when I'm in the water training,

12:32.851 --> 12:34.375
I'll be thinking
of you, Hamilton.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.243
Creepy.

12:36.321 --> 12:38.516
Thanks, but I think you should
stick to your training.

12:38.590 --> 12:40.217
Seems like you could
use a little focus.

12:41.059 --> 12:42.924
I guess we'll find out.

12:44.496 --> 12:45.724
Good seeing you again.

12:52.070 --> 12:55.506
You guys are usually the first
ones in here, let's go.

13:02.914 --> 13:04.848
Let's finish up
Rad Night with a game.

13:04.916 --> 13:07.510
Can anyone tell me what
he or she thinks this is?

13:07.685 --> 13:08.811
Easy, it's a dodge ball.

13:08.887 --> 13:09.876
No.

13:09.954 --> 13:11.751
Or Mars?
Mmm-mmm.

13:11.823 --> 13:12.881
A blob in a lava lamp?

13:14.025 --> 13:15.890
Very creative, but no.

13:16.561 --> 13:18.028
It's a fly's eye.

13:18.096 --> 13:19.188
- Weird.
- Ew!

13:19.264 --> 13:21.164
How about this one?
- A brain.

13:21.466 --> 13:23.024
Aren't brains
supposed to be pink?

13:23.101 --> 13:25.592
A dead, rotting brain?

13:25.670 --> 13:27.831
That is gross,
and that is a walnut.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.438
So, you see how hard it can
be to make sense of things

13:31.543 --> 13:34.307
when you're looking
at them really close?

13:34.379 --> 13:36.370
The same thing's true in life.

13:36.447 --> 13:38.278
So, if you guys are
dealing with anything,

13:38.349 --> 13:40.249
that's just too hard to handle

13:40.318 --> 13:42.650
or doesn't seem
to make much sense,

13:43.121 --> 13:44.452
get a new perspective.

13:44.856 --> 13:46.255
I want to share
with you guys something

13:46.324 --> 13:48.349
that has really made
an impact on my life.

13:48.459 --> 13:51.053
That's Jeremiah 29:11.

13:51.129 --> 13:54.064
"For I know the plans that I
have for you," says the Lord.

13:54.432 --> 13:56.923
"Plans to prosper you
and not to harm you.

13:57.035 --> 13:59.526
"Plans to give you
hope and a future."

14:00.939 --> 14:02.736
That's all the time
we have tonight, guys.

14:02.807 --> 14:04.570
If you are going
on the mission trip,

14:04.642 --> 14:07.338
please don't forget to give
me your permission slips.

14:09.881 --> 14:11.542
Hey, what's up?
What's this?

14:12.016 --> 14:14.917
Well, it looks like I'm not going
to be able to go to Mexico,

14:15.019 --> 14:16.987
so I brought some things
for the orphanage.

14:17.789 --> 14:19.313
I made the bracelets.

14:19.390 --> 14:22.416
Noah donated the shoes
and the Spam's from Timmy.

14:22.961 --> 14:24.451
Are you sure you can't come?

14:25.730 --> 14:28.198
Yeah, I've got to stay and
train now that I'm sponsored.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.527
I was really
looking forward to it.

14:30.602 --> 14:31.830
You're going to miss out.

14:34.005 --> 14:35.905
Well, have a good trip.

14:53.591 --> 14:54.956
Sarah's really bumming me out.

14:55.026 --> 14:56.254
Any particular reason?

14:56.327 --> 14:57.521
Yeah.

14:57.595 --> 15:00.291
So, I told her I'm not
coming to Mexico.

15:00.398 --> 15:01.831
I mean, she knows that I have

15:01.900 --> 15:04.460
two important competitions
coming up, right?

15:04.702 --> 15:06.499
I mean, she knows how much
I've put into this, you know?

15:07.105 --> 15:09.335
How much you and the whole
family has put into this.

15:09.407 --> 15:10.465
So what's her angle?

15:11.776 --> 15:14.142
That going to
Mexico to help kids

15:14.545 --> 15:16.206
is really important.

15:16.281 --> 15:19.273
And I know it is.
I mean, I really, really wish I could go.

15:19.350 --> 15:21.147
It's just,

15:21.219 --> 15:23.084
I've got to stay and
train for regionals.

15:23.154 --> 15:24.553
Did you say you'd go?

15:24.622 --> 15:27.716
Well, yeah, but that was
before I got sponsored.

15:28.159 --> 15:29.820
I mean, it's like
she's counting on me now,

15:29.894 --> 15:32.761
like I'm the only person in the
entire world who can do this.

15:32.830 --> 15:34.297
I mean, I'm not going.

15:34.899 --> 15:36.389
I mean, I can't, right?

15:36.467 --> 15:37.525
It's your call.

15:37.669 --> 15:40.797
Great.
Now I feel even worse.

15:41.606 --> 15:45.042
That's good.
A small step in a good direction.

16:02.927 --> 16:05.191
The girls are all tucked in.

16:05.263 --> 16:08.255
How's it look tomorrow?
Pretty decent, actually.

16:09.133 --> 16:10.122
Well.

16:10.201 --> 16:11.327
No, no, no, you can't.

16:11.402 --> 16:12.426
What?

16:12.503 --> 16:13.492
You have your surgery tomorrow.

16:13.571 --> 16:15.038
The doctor said
no food after 10:00.

16:15.106 --> 16:16.232
This is like juice.

16:16.307 --> 16:17.467
Give it to me.
No. No, no.

16:17.542 --> 16:18.804
Give it.
No.

16:18.876 --> 16:20.741
Give it. Give it.
No.

16:26.117 --> 16:28.415
You need to relax, they'll
never know the difference.

16:28.486 --> 16:29.475
Maybe we shouldn't.

16:29.554 --> 16:31.749
I mean, we have to get up
super early for dawn patrol.

16:31.823 --> 16:32.812
I mean, what happens
if my mom comes in?

16:32.890 --> 16:34.790
Bethany, it'll be worth it.

16:34.859 --> 16:37.350
The moon's full.
The waves are perfect.

16:37.428 --> 16:40.625
I mean, come on, it's almost Halloween.
Even Noah's done it.

16:40.698 --> 16:42.598
He has?
Yeah.

16:42.667 --> 16:43.725
I really wanted to go.

16:43.801 --> 16:45.200
Shh! Okay,
come on, let's go.

17:14.866 --> 17:15.890
Keoki.

17:15.967 --> 17:17.127
I knew it was you!

17:17.201 --> 17:18.292
No way!

17:18.368 --> 17:20.359
Yeah, you surf like a skater.

17:21.305 --> 17:22.738
Hey!

17:29.480 --> 17:30.845
You're toast, Keoki.

17:31.549 --> 17:32.538
Whoa!

17:36.854 --> 17:38.116
Okay, truce. Truce.

17:38.189 --> 17:39.178
Okay, deal.

17:40.625 --> 17:43.594
Bethy, it's almost midnight.

17:43.661 --> 17:45.356
What happens at midnight?

17:45.430 --> 17:46.419
You'll see.

17:48.666 --> 17:49.758
What?

17:52.070 --> 17:53.094
Later skater.

18:04.549 --> 18:05.777
How lucky are we?

18:11.756 --> 18:12.984
Awesome!

18:25.103 --> 18:26.092
Good morning.

18:26.204 --> 18:27.228
Morning.
Morning.

18:27.338 --> 18:29.431
So, as soon as you girls
get back from the water,

18:29.507 --> 18:31.441
I've got an English
assignment all ready for you.

18:31.609 --> 18:32.633
But it's a holiday.

18:32.743 --> 18:33.767
It's Halloween.

18:34.278 --> 18:35.643
We were thinking
that we could have

18:35.713 --> 18:37.180
a couple extra hours
on the waves today?

18:37.415 --> 18:38.746
'Cause you didn't get
enough last night?

18:39.317 --> 18:41.808
Just say the word and we can
enroll you girls in Kapa'a,

18:42.053 --> 18:43.953
where you can ride the bus
for 45 minutes each way

18:44.021 --> 18:46.717
and do eight hours of straight
work during prime surf hours.

18:46.791 --> 18:47.815
'Cause I'm all right with that.

18:48.693 --> 18:50.524
Actually, I love home school.

18:50.595 --> 18:52.563
Me, too.
Adore, totally.

18:53.431 --> 18:55.126
I'm really sorry, Mom.
It's just...

18:55.199 --> 18:58.168
I really, really wanted
to go night surfing.

18:58.236 --> 19:00.898
I mean, everyone talks
about how awesome it is.

19:00.972 --> 19:02.872
I mean, even Noah's done it.
He has?

19:03.174 --> 19:04.436
Good job.

19:05.810 --> 19:07.437
Why didn't you just ask?

19:07.512 --> 19:08.672
Because she knew you'd say no.

19:08.746 --> 19:09.735
How do you know I'd say no?

19:09.814 --> 19:10.803
Would you have let me go?

19:10.882 --> 19:12.873
No. I don't know.

19:13.251 --> 19:15.014
Hey, no, no, no, no.

19:16.187 --> 19:17.654
I promise I'll ask
next time, okay?

19:17.722 --> 19:18.814
I'm going to hold you to that.

19:19.157 --> 19:22.217
Dad, you should have them
upgrade you to a bionic knee

19:22.293 --> 19:24.158
so you can actually
beat Mom in surfing.

19:24.428 --> 19:26.487
It's going to take a lot
more than a bionic knee.

19:26.564 --> 19:28.225
You just wait.

19:28.299 --> 19:29.766
You sure you don't
want me to drive you?

19:29.834 --> 19:31.233
Mom, I got it.

19:31.636 --> 19:33.228
When you come through it,
I will be waiting.

19:35.439 --> 19:36.838
That's your dad, Alana.
Have fun girls.

19:36.908 --> 19:37.966
Bye.

19:38.042 --> 19:40.033
Bye, Dad. Say hi to
Dr. Rovinsky for me.

19:40.111 --> 19:41.510
Have a good surgery,
I'll be praying.

19:41.579 --> 19:44.104
Rip it up. See you
on the flip side.

19:52.256 --> 19:54.087
This is a good one.
This is a good song.

19:55.293 --> 19:57.420
Oh, that looks good,
doesn't it?

20:04.168 --> 20:05.533
All right, we're here.
Let's hit it.

20:05.603 --> 20:06.900
Let's get out.
Let's do it.

20:26.891 --> 20:29.655
Sweet. I've got
a meeting at 10:00,

20:29.727 --> 20:31.558
so we don't have
a lot of time today.

20:31.629 --> 20:34.427
No problem.
Just pick us up after your meeting.

20:34.498 --> 20:36.261
Yeah. Like that's
going to happen.

20:36.334 --> 20:37.926
Let's just get in
the water already.

20:38.002 --> 20:39.867
Come on, it's
a long paddle around the reef.

20:39.937 --> 20:41.905
Try and keep up with us.

20:43.174 --> 20:45.335
Well, the anesthetic should
have started working by now.

20:45.409 --> 20:46.398
You feel anything?

20:46.477 --> 20:48.445
A little bit.

20:48.512 --> 20:50.537
All right, it will
kick in shortly.

20:50.615 --> 20:54.176
We'll have you back out there shredding
waves with Bethany in no time.

20:54.252 --> 20:55.344
Thanks, David.

21:38.763 --> 21:39.855
Yeah!

21:53.878 --> 21:55.675
Whoa! Whoo!

21:57.014 --> 21:58.481
Did you see that one?

21:58.549 --> 22:00.312
That was nice
off the lip, buddy.

22:00.384 --> 22:01.373
Thanks.

22:03.621 --> 22:05.851
I wonder what bathing suit
I should wear to the shoot.

22:05.923 --> 22:09.086
The pink's cute, but the black
really works with my tan.

22:10.161 --> 22:11.788
I don't think
you get to decide.

22:11.862 --> 22:13.489
They'll probably just
tell us what to wear.

22:13.798 --> 22:15.891
I guess, but it's fun
to think about.

22:19.170 --> 22:22.367
Can you believe we get to
come out here every day?

22:22.573 --> 22:23.699
Yeah.

22:27.845 --> 22:29.107
Dad!
Alana!

22:30.314 --> 22:31.338
Shark!

22:32.416 --> 22:33.474
I need to get to the beach.

22:33.551 --> 22:34.575
Oh, God!

22:38.489 --> 22:40.047
Dad,
where's the shark at?

22:40.124 --> 22:42.092
We need to get to the reef!
Just get to the reef.

22:58.309 --> 22:59.742
Keep on the board,
keep on the board.

22:59.810 --> 23:02.870
Byron, you get to shore!
Go! Go! Call 911!

23:04.348 --> 23:05.645
It's going to be okay, Beth.

23:06.817 --> 23:08.284
I'll start it for you!

23:10.888 --> 23:13.083
Come on. Ready, pal? Let's go.
Push, push, push.

23:19.830 --> 23:22.492
Stay with us, sweetie, okay?
Stay with us.

23:22.566 --> 23:24.591
Please, Jesus. Please...

23:25.035 --> 23:26.525
Alana, you keep her on the board.
Okay.

23:26.604 --> 23:28.231
On the board.
Please get me to the beach.

23:28.305 --> 23:29.294
Please.

23:30.908 --> 23:32.569
You're going to be okay!

23:45.156 --> 23:46.180
Come on!

23:59.303 --> 24:01.168
All right, here we go.

24:02.606 --> 24:03.971
Doctor Rovinsky,
we need this room stat!

24:04.041 --> 24:06.236
It's a teenage girl from the North Shore.
Shark attack.

24:07.645 --> 24:09.909
Who? Who is it?

24:10.047 --> 24:12.174
I'll check it out, Tom.
I'll check it out.

24:16.787 --> 24:18.652
Stay with me,
Bethany!

24:25.296 --> 24:26.729
Alana! Get over here!

24:26.797 --> 24:28.196
I can't.

24:30.434 --> 24:31.901
Morning, Mom.

24:32.670 --> 24:34.900
When did you go night surfing?

24:36.373 --> 24:39.001
Uh...
Night surfing...

24:40.778 --> 24:43.076
All right.
All right, sweetheart.

24:43.147 --> 24:44.239
Ambulance is coming, all right?

24:44.315 --> 24:45.339
I want my mom.

24:45.416 --> 24:47.213
I know. We're gonna get your mom.
We're gonna get your mom.

24:47.318 --> 24:49.218
Wait, wait, wait. What?

24:53.290 --> 24:54.314
Mom?

24:54.525 --> 24:56.755
Dad! I called 911!
I called her mom.

24:56.827 --> 24:57.885
Okay, okay, okay.

24:57.962 --> 24:58.986
Grab the foot
of the board. Okay?

24:59.063 --> 25:02.032
Grab it, on the count of three.
Ready? One, two, three!

25:02.099 --> 25:03.123
Go, go, go, go, go!

25:03.267 --> 25:05.064
Take her up to the truck!
Let's get her up there right now!

25:05.135 --> 25:06.261
Come on. Talk to me.

25:16.280 --> 25:17.975
Watch your step right here!
What your step right there!

25:20.117 --> 25:21.379
Where's the ambulance, Dad?
They're not here yet!

25:21.452 --> 25:23.750
Don't worry about the ambulance!
We'll meet it on the way!

25:23.821 --> 25:25.015
Alana,
get the board!

25:25.089 --> 25:27.580
Get her up! All right.
Get up, get up there!

25:43.641 --> 25:45.609
Bethany, can you hear me?
Oh, my God.

25:45.676 --> 25:47.041
She's losing
a lot of blood, Dad!

25:48.979 --> 25:50.378
All right, I see the ambulance.
Here it comes!

25:56.453 --> 25:58.284
Who are you, sir?
Family friend.

25:58.355 --> 26:00.414
Do you know if she hit her head
or ever lost consciousness?

26:00.491 --> 26:02.049
No, she never passed out, but
she's lost a lot of blood.

26:02.126 --> 26:04.356
Here we go!
Careful! Easy.

26:05.095 --> 26:06.084
Okay, lock her in.

26:06.163 --> 26:07.460
Please don't die.

26:07.531 --> 26:09.158
Come on, come on,
come on, sweetie.

26:35.426 --> 26:37.860
Please don't take her!
Please don't take her.

26:38.462 --> 26:39.520
Please don't take her.

26:44.435 --> 26:45.595
Tom, it's Bethany.

26:46.604 --> 26:47.593
No, no! No!

26:47.671 --> 26:48.695
Get me out of here!

26:48.772 --> 26:50.433
Get me out of here! No.
Come on. You can't move!

26:50.507 --> 26:51.496
Just let me get out of here!

26:51.575 --> 26:52.564
You can't walk!

26:52.643 --> 26:53.632
Get me out of here!
No!

26:57.648 --> 27:00.378
Talk to me. Gotta stay with me.
Keep looking at my eyes, okay?

27:02.353 --> 27:03.479
Where's my family?

27:03.554 --> 27:05.351
They're on their way.
They're gonna meet us at the hospital.

27:07.791 --> 27:09.315
She's going into
hypovolemic shock.

27:09.393 --> 27:10.382
We're almost there.

27:14.832 --> 27:15.890
Breathe deep.

27:25.476 --> 27:26.602
Mom, the car!

27:27.645 --> 27:28.907
Stay with me.

27:28.979 --> 27:30.105
Cheri, it happened so fast...

27:32.016 --> 27:33.608
Traumatic amputation.
Severe loss of blood.

27:33.684 --> 27:34.844
I'm here, baby,
I'm right here.

27:34.918 --> 27:36.886
Blood pressure 70 over 40 and dropping.
I'm right here.

27:36.954 --> 27:38.683
Up, up!
Get her in here. Move!

27:38.756 --> 27:40.485
Come on!
Follow it back.

27:41.025 --> 27:42.014
Let's go!
Stay with us!

27:42.092 --> 27:43.286
Hang in there.
Bethany, you'll be okay!

27:43.360 --> 27:44.486
What's happening?

27:51.001 --> 27:51.990
Get her in a bed.

27:52.069 --> 27:53.195
Move her into bay three!

27:53.270 --> 27:54.897
Come on, Bethany.
Stay with us, stay with us.

27:54.972 --> 27:55.961
What's happening?

27:56.040 --> 27:57.064
Bethany!

29:15.586 --> 29:16.644
Mom?

29:18.122 --> 29:20.590
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm right here.

29:24.461 --> 29:25.519
Hey.

29:25.763 --> 29:26.889
We're all here.

29:27.531 --> 29:28.589
It hurts.

29:29.433 --> 29:30.491
Okay.

29:30.567 --> 29:31.556
Noah, get the doctor.

29:31.635 --> 29:33.296
Yeah, I got it.

29:36.140 --> 29:37.232
I'm a little thirsty.

29:37.307 --> 29:38.501
Okay.
Got it.

29:43.614 --> 29:46.378
Dad, please don't cry.

29:48.152 --> 29:49.676
I'm not crying.

29:50.687 --> 29:52.450
I'm going to be okay.

29:52.689 --> 29:53.883
I know.

29:58.862 --> 30:01.387
Hey there, kiddo.

30:02.232 --> 30:03.665
How you holding up?

30:04.301 --> 30:05.700
Pretty good, thanks to you.

30:07.137 --> 30:09.537
I guess I ruined
your surf shirt, huh?

30:10.908 --> 30:12.899
Well, I never liked
that one anyway.

30:14.411 --> 30:17.141
Why don't you just concentrate
on getting better, okay?

30:20.517 --> 30:21.575
Thank you.

30:27.024 --> 30:29.083
You were amazing out there.

30:30.093 --> 30:32.118
You were the one
who kept me calm.

30:32.196 --> 30:33.254
You never...

30:33.931 --> 30:35.023
You never let go.

30:37.267 --> 30:39.497
You are incredibly
brave, Bethany.

30:41.104 --> 30:42.162
Where's Alana?

30:44.374 --> 30:47.741
She's... She's at home.
With her mother.

30:47.811 --> 30:48.903
She's...

30:49.780 --> 30:51.247
She's still
a little freaked out.

30:53.016 --> 30:54.574
But, you know, she'll be better

30:54.651 --> 30:56.084
knowing that you're
going to be okay.

30:56.153 --> 30:57.279
So...

31:01.425 --> 31:02.449
Hey.

31:03.327 --> 31:04.419
How's my favorite patient?

31:04.828 --> 31:06.295
You say
that to everyone.

31:06.897 --> 31:07.989
I mean it when I see you.

31:08.699 --> 31:10.564
I'll wait outside.
I'll see you later.

31:10.934 --> 31:13.767
So, I understand you're
feeling some discomfort.

31:13.837 --> 31:14.826
Yeah.

31:14.905 --> 31:16.202
Well, that's normal.

31:16.340 --> 31:20.208
There's going to be a lot of pain
because of the trauma that you endured.

31:20.277 --> 31:23.542
Not to mention the fact that you've
lost over 60 % of your blood.

31:23.981 --> 31:27.314
You're going to be feeling kind of
lousy for the next few days, kid.

31:28.452 --> 31:30.682
Now here's the thing, Bethany.

31:31.221 --> 31:36.318
The things that you're going to have to
learn to do differently is extensive.

31:36.393 --> 31:37.917
But the good news.

31:37.995 --> 31:39.622
Those things you're not
gonna be able to do

31:40.197 --> 31:41.459
is small.

31:43.467 --> 31:45.230
I'm so proud of you.

31:53.510 --> 31:54.807
I'll tell you something.

31:55.479 --> 31:57.572
She is a living miracle.

31:59.149 --> 32:00.309
Thanks, David.

32:14.865 --> 32:15.957
Hey, sleepy head.

32:16.033 --> 32:17.022
Hi.

32:22.172 --> 32:23.764
How you feeling?

32:25.142 --> 32:26.166
I've been better.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.645
When can I surf again?

32:33.350 --> 32:34.840
Are you busy right now?

32:35.852 --> 32:36.876
Kind of.

32:40.724 --> 32:41.816
Soon.

32:43.193 --> 32:44.785
How do you know?

32:47.230 --> 32:50.688
Because you can
do all things...

32:50.801 --> 32:52.632
Through him who
gives me strength.

32:52.703 --> 32:55.137
...through him who
gives me strength.

33:05.983 --> 33:07.746
Noah, eat your food.

33:08.585 --> 33:10.883
It's gross.
I'm not hungry.

33:10.988 --> 33:12.012
Eat it. Mine's fine.

33:12.389 --> 33:14.380
I said, I'm not hungry.

33:15.325 --> 33:17.657
Well, if you didn't want it, why'd
you let me pay for it then?

33:18.061 --> 33:19.528
Fine.
I'll pay you back.

33:20.731 --> 33:22.028
I think you two
should calm down.

33:22.232 --> 33:23.290
I am calm.

33:23.367 --> 33:24.356
We're not doing this.

33:24.434 --> 33:25.423
Doing what?

33:26.136 --> 33:27.262
Life's got to go on

33:27.337 --> 33:28.895
the way it's always gone on.
What you talking about?

33:28.972 --> 33:30.940
Life is not going to go on the
way it has always gone on.

33:31.008 --> 33:32.873
Will you stop arguing?
No, he's arguing with me.

33:32.943 --> 33:34.342
Everyone's
yelling at everyone.

33:34.411 --> 33:35.708
Stop it.
Stop it!

34:03.306 --> 34:05.900
Hey, sweetheart. It's a dream, okay?
Just a dream, that's all.

34:06.476 --> 34:07.738
Just a dream.

34:07.811 --> 34:09.244
It wasn't a dream!

34:10.112 --> 34:11.205
It was real.

34:12.681 --> 34:15.708
You should go see her.
You know that?

34:17.187 --> 34:19.246
You need to go see her.

34:21.291 --> 34:23.815
...was resting on her surfboard
in the ocean off Hawaii,

34:23.893 --> 34:27.159
when, suddenly,
a shark bites off her arm.

34:27.664 --> 34:32.067
The girl doesn't even scream, and her
composure may have saved her life.

34:32.135 --> 34:33.625
You're
pretty much on every channel.

34:34.471 --> 34:35.665
Hey!

34:36.540 --> 34:38.167
Where have you been?

34:38.241 --> 34:40.208
You know, at home,
living it up.

34:53.356 --> 34:54.652
How have you been?

35:06.036 --> 35:07.867
I thought you
were going to die out there.

35:24.588 --> 35:28.115
So, are you still going to do
that Rip Curl photo shoot?

35:29.192 --> 35:30.682
They wanted me to.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.625
But I told them I couldn't
do it without you.

35:32.696 --> 35:34.323
But that's crazy.

35:34.397 --> 35:36.456
You've been nuts for that shoot.
You have to do it.

35:37.267 --> 35:38.256
Really?

35:38.535 --> 35:40.230
Yeah. Of course.

35:40.604 --> 35:41.764
Do it for both of us.

36:05.629 --> 36:08.860
You're not going to believe
how great the house smells.

36:09.900 --> 36:12.698
Plants are everywhere.

36:12.769 --> 36:14.134
More flowers
have been delivered

36:14.204 --> 36:15.796
than there are growing
on the entire island.

36:16.006 --> 36:17.974
Dr. Rovinsky said
that I can get back

36:18.041 --> 36:20.373
in the water as soon
as my stitches come out.

36:21.745 --> 36:23.042
Can we try a shower first?

36:38.562 --> 36:40.792
That's so cool.
Who did that?

36:40.864 --> 36:41.853
Everybody.

36:43.099 --> 36:45.499
The bite on Bethany
Hamilton's surfboard

36:45.569 --> 36:48.197
was 16 inches long
and 8 inches wide.

36:48.305 --> 36:50.967
...currently searching for a
shark believed to be responsible

36:51.041 --> 36:53.236
for the attack on
Bethany Hamilton.

36:53.310 --> 36:54.299
It's okay.

36:57.614 --> 36:59.241
Hey! Hey! Hey!

37:00.050 --> 37:01.347
Hey! Get out of here!

37:01.418 --> 37:02.476
Where's Dad?

37:02.552 --> 37:03.746
Bethany!

37:09.392 --> 37:10.723
I said leave!

37:10.994 --> 37:12.188
Noah! Noah!

37:12.262 --> 37:13.752
Just get back in the house.
Dad...

37:13.830 --> 37:14.922
Unlock the back door.

37:14.998 --> 37:16.625
Bethany, is this...
Come on, get out of my way!

37:16.700 --> 37:18.861
Excuse me! Pardon me!
Excuse me! Excuse me.

37:19.102 --> 37:20.433
I've got it from here,
honey. Scoot over.

37:20.503 --> 37:21.800
What are you gonna do?

37:45.028 --> 37:46.791
Nice driving, 007.

37:46.863 --> 37:49.297
You know what?
I never liked those bushes anyway, Dad.

37:49.366 --> 37:51.095
Come on, Bethany,
I got you.

37:51.167 --> 37:53.032
Give me your bag.
I didn't know you could drive like that.

37:53.937 --> 37:54.995
Neither did I.

37:59.609 --> 38:01.406
So what do we do now?

38:01.911 --> 38:05.039
Remember when we brought
Noah home from the hospital?

38:05.115 --> 38:08.141
He was our first baby and
we had no clue what to do.

38:09.085 --> 38:10.985
It's the same thing.

38:11.054 --> 38:13.045
We'll take it day by day.

38:24.234 --> 38:25.633
That's so messed up.

38:25.702 --> 38:27.033
I wish they would go away.

38:30.974 --> 38:32.999
Ginger! Hi, girl!

38:34.411 --> 38:35.503
Oh!

38:35.578 --> 38:37.170
I know, I know, I know.

38:38.715 --> 38:39.875
I know. It's still me.

38:40.784 --> 38:42.046
Ginger!

38:43.787 --> 38:45.755
Who's up for sandwiches?

38:46.923 --> 38:49.323
Sounds so good, I'm starving.

38:49.392 --> 38:50.984
Noah?
Yeah, sure.

38:53.697 --> 38:55.392
Okay, where's my Spam?

38:55.732 --> 38:56.721
Mexico.

38:57.033 --> 38:58.022
All of it?

39:01.638 --> 39:02.696
I got it.
I got it, sweetie.

39:03.173 --> 39:04.538
Sorry, Mom.
It's okay.

39:20.390 --> 39:21.857
Here, let me grab that.

39:21.925 --> 39:23.187
You want to get
some bread, love?

39:23.259 --> 39:24.351
Yeah.

39:32.736 --> 39:33.862
Um...

39:34.671 --> 39:36.298
I need to go unpack.

39:36.373 --> 39:37.362
Are you sure?
Uh-huh.

40:19.682 --> 40:20.910
I have some
good news to share.

40:21.117 --> 40:22.141
What news?

40:22.585 --> 40:25.383
Holt got a call from that
show, Inside Edition,

40:26.356 --> 40:29.120
and they want to give
Bethany a prosthetic arm.

40:29.192 --> 40:31.285
Wait, wait, wait.
She's been home for five minutes.

40:31.361 --> 40:32.419
They're gonna pay
for the entire thing.

40:32.495 --> 40:33.860
When did you talk to a TV show?

40:33.930 --> 40:35.158
And it's custom made.

40:35.832 --> 40:37.823
Will it look normal?

40:37.901 --> 40:39.198
I would think so.

40:39.269 --> 40:40.736
Awesome.

40:40.837 --> 40:42.031
Can they make one
I can surf with?

40:42.105 --> 40:43.163
What does she have to do?

40:43.239 --> 40:46.538
All she has to do is give a brief
interview, wearing the arm.

40:46.609 --> 40:49.271
Check out my sister
the celebrity.

40:49.345 --> 40:50.676
You don't have to do this.

40:50.747 --> 40:52.977
No. I want to.

40:54.484 --> 40:56.008
Yeah, yeah, I'll do it.

40:56.085 --> 40:57.677
So, it's settled.

40:58.321 --> 41:00.516
Hey, wait.
Let's give thanks.

41:23.646 --> 41:25.637
That arm could
not come soon enough.

41:25.715 --> 41:27.512
Because trying to
make do with only one,

41:28.084 --> 41:30.052
even harder than it sounds.

41:30.119 --> 41:32.849
I mean, fixing your hair is
not exactly rocket science.

41:32.922 --> 41:34.947
Unless you've only got one arm.

41:35.024 --> 41:37.458
Then it might as well
be a mission to Mars.

41:37.527 --> 41:40.189
Every day of my life, for as
far back as I could remember,

41:40.263 --> 41:41.662
I was in the water.

41:41.731 --> 41:45.030
And now, I couldn't even
put my bathing suit on.

41:45.201 --> 41:47.863
Almost everything
seemed to be a challenge.

41:47.937 --> 41:52.101
But what scared me most, was that I
might not be able to surf again.

41:59.749 --> 42:00.909
It's so sad.

42:14.197 --> 42:16.927
Mommy, what happened
to that girl's arm?

42:18.234 --> 42:19.326
I'm sorry.

42:23.506 --> 42:24.700
Should I go?

42:24.774 --> 42:26.833
Or do you want to do this together?
It's up to you.

42:27.977 --> 42:29.001
Stay.

42:32.148 --> 42:33.240
Okay.

42:38.288 --> 42:39.346
Oh, it's looking great.

42:41.024 --> 42:43.424
It's healing nicely.
You all right?

42:46.763 --> 42:48.230
There you go.

42:53.736 --> 42:56.034
It's going to look better
once the stitches are out.

43:30.673 --> 43:32.072
Is she okay?

43:34.410 --> 43:35.672
You okay?

43:53.029 --> 43:55.759
Hey! I just got
back from Mexico.

43:55.832 --> 43:58.892
I'm so glad you're okay.

43:58.968 --> 44:01.368
I was just about
to come see you.

44:01.437 --> 44:03.029
I couldn't wait.

44:03.106 --> 44:04.437
Come here.

44:05.441 --> 44:09.878
I was thinking about you, and
praying for you every minute.

44:09.946 --> 44:11.345
How are you?

44:11.414 --> 44:12.506
Oh...

44:12.815 --> 44:16.478
I'm good. Yeah.
Everyone's been doing really good.

44:19.255 --> 44:21.689
You don't have to
do that, Bethany.

44:21.758 --> 44:23.123
Not with me.

44:25.161 --> 44:26.719
Um...

44:27.163 --> 44:29.825
They're trying
to help. I know.

44:30.633 --> 44:31.827
I know.

44:33.636 --> 44:35.194
But...

44:37.607 --> 44:38.869
But what?

44:42.512 --> 44:47.848
You know how you said it's hard
to see things clearly sometimes

44:47.917 --> 44:49.544
when you're too close?
Mmm-hmm.

44:51.387 --> 44:55.517
Well, I've been trying
to get some perspective.

44:56.192 --> 44:57.557
I've been really trying.

45:09.706 --> 45:14.871
Sarah, how can this be
God's plan for me?

45:14.944 --> 45:16.673
I don't understand.

45:23.119 --> 45:26.953
I don't know why terrible
things happen to us sometimes.

45:28.624 --> 45:32.492
But I have to believe that something
good is going to come out of this.

45:33.262 --> 45:34.456
Okay.

45:34.530 --> 45:36.259
I don't know what that is.

45:38.134 --> 45:39.897
I really wish I did.

45:41.404 --> 45:42.735
Come here.

45:53.983 --> 45:55.143
Hello?

45:56.686 --> 45:57.744
Dad.

46:00.189 --> 46:01.520
Excuse us.

46:30.019 --> 46:32.044
That's a perfect fit, bro.

46:41.464 --> 46:42.931
Come on, Dad.

47:11.694 --> 47:13.525
Hey, Alana, can you take
a little half step forward?

47:13.596 --> 47:15.530
Put your hand a little
higher on the board.

47:15.598 --> 47:17.691
That is gorgeous.
Perfect.

47:20.403 --> 47:21.734
Beautiful.

47:23.005 --> 47:25.803
You're natural born
for this. Gorgeous.

47:27.443 --> 47:29.206
Absolutely gorgeous.

47:40.356 --> 47:42.187
Actually, Alana,
go take a break, come back,

47:42.258 --> 47:43.748
grab a new bikini,
that'd be perfect.

47:49.966 --> 47:51.297
So? How did I look?

47:51.367 --> 47:52.493
Great.

47:53.135 --> 47:54.329
Not too cheesy, right?

47:54.637 --> 47:55.763
Uh...

47:55.905 --> 47:58.237
Somewhere between cheddar
and jalapeno jack.

48:02.111 --> 48:03.169
Thank you.

48:06.349 --> 48:08.579
That guy's ripping
it up out there, yeah?

48:08.651 --> 48:09.640
Yeah.

48:09.719 --> 48:11.118
Hey, Alana, we're ready
for you over here!

48:13.856 --> 48:16.381
You know, you should
be doing this with me.

48:17.727 --> 48:18.785
No.

48:19.362 --> 48:20.590
You should.

48:22.031 --> 48:23.293
Go on, they're waiting for you.

48:24.500 --> 48:25.694
Don't worry about me.

48:38.547 --> 48:40.879
She's right,
you should listen to her.

48:42.318 --> 48:43.842
Yeah, and you should
stop listening

48:43.920 --> 48:47.151
to other people's
conversations, you kook.

48:47.223 --> 48:48.781
Just got your back.

48:48.858 --> 48:49.950
Loser.

48:50.026 --> 48:51.050
Poser.

48:54.864 --> 48:57.662
You should be out there
with her, though.

49:00.369 --> 49:02.462
Yeah, I should be with her.

49:04.173 --> 49:05.697
Just not there.

49:09.512 --> 49:11.343
What's
taking so long?

49:18.654 --> 49:20.451
So what's
for breakfast?

49:21.590 --> 49:22.955
Wouldn't you like to know?

49:23.059 --> 49:24.822
Yeah, we would.
We're hungry! Yes!

49:28.831 --> 49:30.958
Mmm.

49:31.801 --> 49:33.428
Okay.
What's the occasion?

49:34.804 --> 49:37.830
Does there have to be an occasion
for me to make my family

49:37.907 --> 49:40.501
fresh squeezed orange juice
and homemade banana bread?

49:41.978 --> 49:44.708
You do realize that tomorrow is
Thanksgiving, not today, right?

49:44.947 --> 49:47.541
Yeah. That's why
it's the perfect time.

49:48.017 --> 49:49.075
Perfect time for what?

49:50.519 --> 49:51.679
To get back in the water.

50:08.871 --> 50:10.532
Aren't you afraid?

50:11.507 --> 50:13.236
I'm more afraid of not surfing.

50:13.309 --> 50:16.540
All right, get out there and
have some fun!

50:18.447 --> 50:19.675
Come on.

50:20.383 --> 50:21.577
Come on, let's go already!

50:25.988 --> 50:27.478
Are you ready?

50:28.190 --> 50:29.384
If she is, I am.

50:36.365 --> 50:38.492
Grab my ankle,
I'll tow you out.

50:38.567 --> 50:39.556
No, I'm good.

50:43.873 --> 50:45.340
There you go!

50:46.375 --> 50:48.502
Just take it nice
and easy, Bethany.

50:53.015 --> 50:56.143
Hey, don't worry about it.
It was a junk wave anyway.

50:56.218 --> 50:58.345
Yeah, I'll get the next one.

51:02.858 --> 51:03.882
Ooh!

51:05.928 --> 51:08.726
Why don't you
just paddle today?

51:08.798 --> 51:10.425
No.

51:10.499 --> 51:11.488
We can come back tomorrow.

51:11.567 --> 51:12.625
No, I'm good.

51:17.440 --> 51:19.908
Try putting your hand in
the center of the board,

51:20.009 --> 51:22.307
along the stringer
so you don't tip over.

51:29.652 --> 51:31.119
Be patient, honey.

51:45.801 --> 51:47.359
Yes!

51:47.436 --> 51:48.630
Look at that!
Yeah!

51:54.577 --> 51:55.771
Yeah!

52:08.090 --> 52:10.115
Yeah!

52:10.192 --> 52:13.457
That's the way to go, honey!

52:13.529 --> 52:15.053
Got it all on camera.

52:15.131 --> 52:16.462
Training starts tomorrow.

52:16.532 --> 52:17.829
Training for what?

52:17.933 --> 52:19.093
The Hawaiian Island Regionals.

52:37.553 --> 52:38.884
Excuse me!

52:39.588 --> 52:41.453
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

52:41.524 --> 52:42.923
Happy Thanksgiving!

52:42.992 --> 52:44.357
Thanks so much for coming.

52:44.426 --> 52:47.554
And if you don't mind, I'd like
to offer up a little toast.

52:47.630 --> 52:48.995
Sweetheart.

52:50.599 --> 52:55.298
We are so blessed and thankful
to God for all of you

52:55.871 --> 52:56.929
because of your love

52:57.606 --> 53:00.404
and your support
over the past few weeks.

53:01.610 --> 53:05.444
And we are especially thankful to be
spending yet another Thanksgiving

53:05.548 --> 53:07.607
with our sweet,
beloved daughter.

53:08.217 --> 53:09.275
Here's to Bethany!

53:09.652 --> 53:11.085
To Bethany!

53:15.591 --> 53:16.717
That was embarrassing.

53:16.792 --> 53:18.191
I thought it was wonderful.

53:19.628 --> 53:21.095
Hey!
Hey!

53:21.163 --> 53:22.425
I heard you're
back in the water.

53:22.498 --> 53:23.897
I know, and there's
something else.

53:23.966 --> 53:25.399
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.

53:26.101 --> 53:27.830
I'm surfing the Hawaiian
Island Regionals.

53:27.903 --> 53:29.530
Are you kidding me?
No!

53:29.605 --> 53:31.038
Oh, my gosh, that's so amazing!

53:31.106 --> 53:32.664
Bethany, I am so proud of you!

53:32.741 --> 53:33.730
Thanks.

53:34.009 --> 53:36.500
Well, you really outdid yourself
again this year, Cheri.

53:36.579 --> 53:38.513
I helped.
He tasted everything.

53:38.581 --> 53:41.311
Yeah, one of my many talents.
Like clearing the table.

53:41.383 --> 53:43.146
Let me help you.
Thank you.

53:47.223 --> 53:50.590
I realize this would be a very
different day without you.

53:51.860 --> 53:54.158
You know, I just wish
I could have done more.

53:55.297 --> 53:58.494
Our family is a family
because of you.

54:05.474 --> 54:08.307
We have made this to
your exact specifications.

54:08.377 --> 54:10.174
Doesn't it look real?

54:12.081 --> 54:15.073
Yeah. That's kind of
weird how real it looks.

54:15.184 --> 54:19.314
And you can even
paint the fingernails.

54:20.723 --> 54:21.951
Shall we try it on?

54:26.228 --> 54:28.753
Now, you just take that strap,
and I'll take this one.

54:30.199 --> 54:31.564
Hold tight.

54:33.636 --> 54:35.365
There, how does that feel?

54:35.437 --> 54:36.461
It's okay.

54:39.408 --> 54:42.206
Let me just see how
it works on my board.

54:48.017 --> 54:49.314
Not weight bearing.

54:49.385 --> 54:51.546
How am I supposed to use
it to push up on my board?

54:51.654 --> 54:53.588
I think you might have to
do that with the other arm.

54:53.656 --> 54:55.886
So, is there a way I can
grab the rails to duck dive?

54:56.358 --> 54:58.724
Honey, why don't you
just give it a chance?

54:58.794 --> 55:00.762
How am I supposed to paddle
and surf in this thing?

55:01.397 --> 55:02.421
I mean, look at it!

55:02.731 --> 55:03.993
Yeah.

55:04.066 --> 55:07.126
Because the remainder
of your arm is so short,

55:07.202 --> 55:11.332
mobility will be limited.

55:11.640 --> 55:12.902
But there's so much
more you can do...

55:12.975 --> 55:14.203
Can I take it off, please?

55:14.310 --> 55:15.607
- Every single thing...
- Take it off.

55:15.678 --> 55:18.238
She said she wants you to take it off.
You can turn that off.

55:20.883 --> 55:22.908
Hey! No! Hey!
Don't! Hey! Drop it!

55:22.985 --> 55:24.543
Ginger!
- Drop it! Ginger, stop!

55:24.620 --> 55:25.678
Drop it!
- No. Release!

55:25.754 --> 55:27.415
Honey, you can still
surf without it.

55:27.489 --> 55:28.615
- Let it go!
- Ginger!

55:28.691 --> 55:29.749
Bad dog!
Ginger!

55:29.825 --> 55:30.849
Bad dog!

55:44.306 --> 55:46.069
I like her
better that way.

55:51.480 --> 55:53.345
Dad was right.

55:54.083 --> 55:55.641
I don't need it to surf.

55:55.718 --> 55:57.208
No, you don't.

56:04.226 --> 56:06.194
Would it be better to
just say it out loud?

56:09.998 --> 56:11.397
I thought...

56:12.735 --> 56:15.568
I thought at least with clothes
on, I could have two arms.

56:17.873 --> 56:19.738
Thought I could look normal.

56:20.342 --> 56:22.310
Normal is so overrated.

56:22.378 --> 56:23.902
But people like normal, Mom.

56:24.380 --> 56:25.779
Who?
Guys do.

56:28.751 --> 56:30.446
I mean, who will even
like me with this?

56:31.320 --> 56:35.620
The right guy will love you
exactly the way you are.

56:36.558 --> 56:38.526
Because you're beautiful.

56:38.961 --> 56:40.053
How do you know?

56:40.963 --> 56:42.487
Because I know.

56:45.868 --> 56:48.302
What's that worth,
right? Nothing.

56:57.579 --> 56:59.911
What are you doing?

56:59.982 --> 57:03.543
We had this statue in my house,
when I was a little girl.

57:04.153 --> 57:07.589
It was a replica from a museum
my parents once went to.

57:07.656 --> 57:10.022
I didn't even think
about it until just now.

57:11.093 --> 57:12.583
Venus de Milo.

57:13.328 --> 57:15.125
For centuries,
all around the world,

57:15.230 --> 57:18.063
she was considered
the pinnacle of beauty.

57:20.669 --> 57:23.103
And she has one
less arm than you.

57:26.475 --> 57:28.272
Yeah, but I can surf.

57:32.047 --> 57:33.878
So, regionals.

57:33.949 --> 57:36.747
What we have to do is
to get you from here

57:39.955 --> 57:42.150
to here.

57:42.224 --> 57:43.486
It's not going to be easy.

57:44.359 --> 57:46.953
I don't need easy,
I just need possible.

57:48.831 --> 57:51.595
With you, anything's possible.

57:53.202 --> 57:54.226
Let's do it.

58:16.758 --> 58:17.952
Right there.
On the take off.

58:18.026 --> 58:19.323
Right there. Now, look.
A little back step.

58:19.394 --> 58:20.383
Yeah.

58:20.462 --> 58:22.396
That could be a sign...
'Cause that time I wiped out.

58:30.539 --> 58:32.063
Just a hair late
when you take off.

58:33.308 --> 58:36.072
So, I'll just adjust my body so
that my weight is even more...

58:36.144 --> 58:37.736
Or bring your arm all
the way around. Yes.

59:01.136 --> 59:02.933
Look at her. That's it.
That's it, right there!

59:03.005 --> 59:04.472
That is perfect.
Okay.

59:04.540 --> 59:06.371
That's what you want to
go for every time. Yup.

59:14.616 --> 59:16.049
How'd you feel out
there this morning?

59:16.818 --> 59:20.652
Pretty good. I mean, I have a little
trouble getting under the big waves,

59:20.756 --> 59:22.246
but once I'm up, I'm solid.

59:25.193 --> 59:27.923
I'll come in if I can't
handle it, okay?

59:31.700 --> 59:33.099
Good morning.
I'm Piper Borraow.

59:33.168 --> 59:34.157
And I'm Rob Bucannan.

59:34.236 --> 59:37.103
And we'd like to welcome you to
the Hawaiian Island Regionals.

59:56.058 --> 59:57.685
How do you feel?

59:57.759 --> 59:58.817
Like barfing.

59:58.894 --> 01:00:00.759
Yeah, well, aim for Malina.

01:00:00.896 --> 01:00:03.262
If you don't want to do
this, you don't have to.

01:00:03.332 --> 01:00:04.993
I'm not going to pull out now.

01:00:05.067 --> 01:00:07.467
Besides everyone
knows I've entered.

01:00:07.536 --> 01:00:08.560
It's now or never.

01:00:08.637 --> 01:00:10.832
Soledad O'Brian is
in Phuket, Thailand.

01:00:10.906 --> 01:00:14.069
She has been following
efforts by some survivors

01:00:14.142 --> 01:00:16.201
to find their
missing loved ones.

01:00:16.278 --> 01:00:18.405
Hey, Bethany. Good luck
out there today, yeah.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.674
Thanks.

01:00:20.215 --> 01:00:21.773
Man, that's really awful.

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:24.944
Clearly, wherever you
look along the path of this tsunami

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.046
there is just stories of loss,
and thousands already...

01:00:28.123 --> 01:00:30.114
I hope you guys get
a lot of donations.

01:00:30.192 --> 01:00:32.092
Yeah, Sarah's organizing a trip
to help the kids in Thailand.

01:00:33.228 --> 01:00:35.822
My heat's coming up,
I gotta go. Bye.

01:00:37.899 --> 01:00:39.264
Great to have you
back, Bethany.

01:00:39.334 --> 01:00:41.529
Thanks, it's good to be back.

01:00:43.805 --> 01:00:46.137
So you're actually
going through with this?

01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:47.300
Yeah.

01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:55.381
- Hey, Bethany.
- Hey.

01:00:55.450 --> 01:00:58.180
Judges have approved giving
you a five minute head start.

01:01:03.492 --> 01:01:05.187
I don't want it.
Bethany.

01:01:06.028 --> 01:01:07.620
I don't need it.

01:01:09.731 --> 01:01:10.993
Okay.

01:01:31.386 --> 01:01:32.375
Come on, Bethany.

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:33.780
First heat has started

01:01:33.855 --> 01:01:36.551
and the girls are making their
way out into the lineup.

01:01:52.741 --> 01:01:55.471
All right, we've got Bethany
Hamilton in the blue jersey

01:01:55.544 --> 01:01:57.205
trying to catch her first wave.

01:01:57.546 --> 01:01:58.911
See ya!

01:02:00.182 --> 01:02:02.412
Bethany unable to
get into that wave.

01:02:02.484 --> 01:02:05.112
Meanwhile, Malina Birch
scratches into one.

01:02:05.187 --> 01:02:07.052
Looks like a good one.

01:02:09.391 --> 01:02:10.756
All right,
Malina Birch dropped in

01:02:10.826 --> 01:02:12.623
on that inside roll,
nice bottom turn.

01:02:12.694 --> 01:02:14.594
Off the bottom, coming up.

01:02:15.063 --> 01:02:16.121
Comes around the corner,

01:02:16.198 --> 01:02:18.029
gets a nice vertical
off the top there

01:02:19.935 --> 01:02:21.527
As she kicks out
to the challengers.

01:02:22.671 --> 01:02:24.070
Hamilton drops
into a nice looking wave.

01:02:25.907 --> 01:02:28.467
Ooh! A little loss
of control there.

01:02:28.977 --> 01:02:31.741
But nice recovery.
She cuts back into the white water.

01:02:32.013 --> 01:02:34.607
Should be a decent scoring
ride for the surfer in blue.

01:02:51.933 --> 01:02:54.333
All right, Alana Blanchard,
drops into a wave of her own,

01:02:54.402 --> 01:02:57.235
nice off the bottom,
big snap off the top.

01:02:57.305 --> 01:03:00.502
Sets up again for a nice cut
back into the white water.

01:03:01.576 --> 01:03:04.170
Speeding down the line

01:03:04.346 --> 01:03:06.541
looking for a little tube
section, gets in there.

01:03:06.615 --> 01:03:09.743
Threads that little
barrel and exits.

01:03:10.452 --> 01:03:12.784
Nice wave for Alana Blanchard.

01:03:12.921 --> 01:03:15.321
All right, Rockwell, it looks
like at the ten minute mark

01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:19.827
we have Malina Birch in first
with a 7.3 on her first ride.

01:03:20.228 --> 01:03:22.696
Alana Blanchard
is second with a 6.2.

01:03:22.764 --> 01:03:24.994
And in third place,
Leila Hurst with a 5.3.

01:03:25.066 --> 01:03:26.090
The surf is picking up.

01:03:26.168 --> 01:03:28.693
Whoa, look at that outside,
a big set approaching.

01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:30.567
It looks like Bethany Hamilton
is going to get caught

01:03:30.639 --> 01:03:33.437
inside of the biggest
wave of the day.

01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:35.137
Come on, Bethany.
Come on!

01:03:40.615 --> 01:03:43.083
Mountains of water rolling
through here at Sunset Beach

01:03:43.151 --> 01:03:45.415
and it looks like our competitor
in blue, Bethany Hamilton,

01:03:45.487 --> 01:03:47.148
just taking some donuts out there.

01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:52.593
No! I'm fine!

01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:54.358
I knew she wouldn't come in.

01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:04.336
Bethany, grab my leash, I'll pull
you the rest of the way out.

01:04:04.406 --> 01:04:07.466
No, I'm fine.
I can do this!

01:04:09.611 --> 01:04:10.703
Come on, Bethany!

01:04:10.779 --> 01:04:11.939
All right,
four minutes left,

01:04:12.013 --> 01:04:14.914
and Bethany Hamilton still
stuck in the impact zone, Rob.

01:04:14.983 --> 01:04:16.746
Bethany, in sixth
place, right now.

01:04:16.818 --> 01:04:18.308
She's still needing
quite a score.

01:04:18.386 --> 01:04:19.819
She's okay.

01:04:22.691 --> 01:04:25.751
Malina, don't!
You have enough, let her have it!

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.264
Alana Blanchard just
dropped in on Malina Birch.

01:04:39.908 --> 01:04:42.843
That's definitely going to be an
interference call on Blanchard.

01:04:42.911 --> 01:04:44.936
Alana Blanchard will
not make it on this heat,

01:04:45.013 --> 01:04:47.345
has been disqualified
for the interference.

01:05:06.568 --> 01:05:08.661
I can't take it anymore, I want
you to get her out of there.

01:05:08.737 --> 01:05:09.726
I want her out of there.

01:05:09.804 --> 01:05:10.964
The lifeguards are on it.

01:05:11.039 --> 01:05:13.030
Oh, man, it looks
like she broke her board.

01:05:13.108 --> 01:05:14.905
Well, unfortunately
for Bethany Hamilton,

01:05:14.976 --> 01:05:17.672
a broken board right now,
puts her in a bad position,

01:05:17.746 --> 01:05:19.213
with only 3 minutes remaining,

01:05:19.281 --> 01:05:22.842
there's no chance she's making
it out of this first heat.

01:05:25.253 --> 01:05:26.982
You shouldn't have dropped
in on Malina like that.

01:05:27.055 --> 01:05:29.023
She was trying...
She was just hassling me,

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:30.079
like she always does.

01:05:30.158 --> 01:05:31.147
She's a jerk!

01:05:31.226 --> 01:05:33.421
At least she was treating me
like I was real competition.

01:05:33.528 --> 01:05:35.120
Bethany,
what happened to you out there?

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:36.758
Bethany.

01:05:37.465 --> 01:05:39.023
Can we please just
get out of here?

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.931
Make a path!
Get out of the way!

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.877
Bethany,
how are you feeling?

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:55.849
That's enough, come on.

01:05:57.852 --> 01:05:59.820
Bethany, I know
that you got beat up

01:05:59.888 --> 01:06:01.378
pretty bad out there
today, sweetheart.

01:06:01.456 --> 01:06:02.753
But you can't
let it get you down.

01:06:02.824 --> 01:06:05.486
Enough, Dad, okay?
I can't do this anymore!

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.754
Yes, you can, honey.

01:06:06.828 --> 01:06:08.090
Listen to her.

01:06:12.734 --> 01:06:14.793
Bethany!
Bethany! Bethany!

01:06:14.869 --> 01:06:17.565
Hey, Bethany!
Can I get your autograph?

01:06:21.042 --> 01:06:23.670
I have something
even better actually.

01:06:33.955 --> 01:06:35.422
Here.

01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:36.479
Cool!

01:06:36.558 --> 01:06:38.321
Bethany, what are you doing?

01:06:40.462 --> 01:06:42.896
Oh, my God!
This is so cool!

01:06:44.899 --> 01:06:46.833
Awesome, thanks!

01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:47.890
Enjoy them.

01:07:00.382 --> 01:07:01.371
Bethany.

01:07:01.449 --> 01:07:03.713
Dad, just stop. Okay?

01:07:04.652 --> 01:07:05.641
It's over.

01:07:16.564 --> 01:07:18.555
That's not
what I'm saying.

01:07:18.633 --> 01:07:19.998
You can't give up on her.

01:07:20.068 --> 01:07:22.059
And you can't keep
pushing at her.

01:07:22.837 --> 01:07:25.203
What are you supposed to
do, just let her quit?

01:07:25.273 --> 01:07:26.433
If she wants to, yes.

01:07:26.508 --> 01:07:28.442
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:30.000
Then you're not hearing
what I'm saying.

01:07:30.078 --> 01:07:32.706
What? What is it
that I'm not hearing?

01:07:32.781 --> 01:07:35.875
You can't always fix
everything by sheer will.

01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:37.918
Sometimes there is no...

01:07:37.986 --> 01:07:39.954
...Hamilton has to
be considered the favorite

01:07:40.021 --> 01:07:42.114
as we head to the
Hawaiian Island Regionals.

01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:43.550
She's a surfer.

01:07:43.625 --> 01:07:44.751
She's a competitor.

01:07:44.826 --> 01:07:46.054
She's more than that.

01:07:46.127 --> 01:07:48.721
Cheri, if she walks
away from this...

01:07:49.364 --> 01:07:52.265
If she quits, she may never
get back in the water again.

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:54.392
And she will never be the same.

01:07:54.669 --> 01:07:57.763
She will never be the same.

01:07:59.674 --> 01:08:03.405
And if she thinks the only life
out there for her is surfing

01:08:03.478 --> 01:08:04.911
and she can't make that happen

01:08:04.979 --> 01:08:06.913
then she's going to be lost.

01:08:07.182 --> 01:08:09.412
Really, really lost.

01:08:30.772 --> 01:08:34.606
Go ahead, tell me how
everything's going to be okay.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:41.813
Yeah, that's me. Mister
jump-right-in-and-fix-it.

01:08:45.453 --> 01:08:49.149
If I could just keep
my mouth shut for once.

01:08:50.692 --> 01:08:52.488
I'm done, aren't I?

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:58.590
I can't even paddle out to the
lineup past the big waves.

01:08:59.701 --> 01:09:01.430
I don't understand.

01:09:03.337 --> 01:09:06.569
What happened to
"I can do all things"?

01:09:11.011 --> 01:09:12.069
Why?

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.444
Why did this happen?

01:09:17.585 --> 01:09:19.678
Why did I have to
lose everything?

01:09:19.754 --> 01:09:22.279
You didn't lose
everything, Bethany.

01:09:23.191 --> 01:09:24.715
Not even close.

01:09:26.461 --> 01:09:30.022
That shark didn't kill you.
You're still here.

01:09:30.999 --> 01:09:32.728
You're still alive.

01:09:33.868 --> 01:09:36.063
With a family that loves you.

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:41.870
What am I supposed to do now?

01:09:47.615 --> 01:09:48.604
I don't know.

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:52.483
Then how am I supposed to know?

01:09:56.858 --> 01:09:59.292
When the time is right,
you'll know.

01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:03.162
Until then, you pray

01:10:05.533 --> 01:10:07.000
and you listen.

01:10:07.936 --> 01:10:09.426
Listen for what?

01:10:11.706 --> 01:10:13.469
For what comes next.

01:10:25.987 --> 01:10:27.318
Okay, Lymar,
I hope you remembered

01:10:27.388 --> 01:10:29.413
your toothbrush
this time. Okay?

01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:30.889
Did you remember your socks?

01:10:30.959 --> 01:10:32.984
Because you are not
borrowing mine again.

01:10:33.061 --> 01:10:35.052
Could you pass these out?

01:10:35.964 --> 01:10:36.953
Bethany?

01:10:41.703 --> 01:10:42.931
Mind if I tag along?

01:10:45.006 --> 01:10:48.373
I'm sure we can scrounge up
something for you to do.

01:10:53.581 --> 01:10:54.570
Hey.

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:20.358
All right, guys, let's go!

01:12:39.887 --> 01:12:41.047
Rosemary!

01:12:41.122 --> 01:12:43.682
Sarah!
Hey, thank you for coming.

01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:45.047
This is Bethany.

01:12:45.126 --> 01:12:47.959
Bethany, yeah, I've heard a lot about you.
I'm happy you're here.

01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:50.725
Grab some bags
and pass them out.

01:12:50.798 --> 01:12:53.130
All right,
everybody make a line.

01:12:53.201 --> 01:12:55.897
Just grab it and pass it down.
Come on.

01:12:56.237 --> 01:12:57.932
Keep it going!
Come on guys.

01:12:58.005 --> 01:12:59.973
Keep going.
Make a line.

01:13:00.041 --> 01:13:01.269
Got it?

01:13:03.478 --> 01:13:04.740
Good job.

01:13:13.955 --> 01:13:16.355
She wants to thank you all
for what you've been doing.

01:13:16.424 --> 01:13:17.482
They're very grateful.

01:13:17.558 --> 01:13:20.527
We're so happy we can help, we
know they've been through so much.

01:13:24.699 --> 01:13:27.566
She says it was just
a normal day like any other.

01:13:28.503 --> 01:13:30.471
But that they saw
the water roll back

01:13:30.538 --> 01:13:33.063
and they went to get the
fish and the lobsters.

01:13:33.641 --> 01:13:36.610
But then they saw the wave
and it was too late.

01:13:37.011 --> 01:13:39.605
And the water just kept coming,
there weren't many survivors.

01:13:41.449 --> 01:13:43.076
I lost my family.

01:13:44.952 --> 01:13:47.477
Another family,
they all died...

01:13:53.494 --> 01:13:54.756
I'm so sad.

01:14:09.544 --> 01:14:10.806
You okay?

01:14:12.213 --> 01:14:13.339
Yeah.

01:14:14.115 --> 01:14:17.607
It's all right, don't be sorry
for compassion, Bethany.

01:14:18.219 --> 01:14:20.585
It can move us
to do amazing things.

01:14:20.955 --> 01:14:23.890
And it can help you
get a new perspective.

01:14:24.725 --> 01:14:26.215
Why don't you take a minute,

01:14:26.294 --> 01:14:28.626
then when you're feeling
better, come back and join us.

01:14:28.696 --> 01:14:30.994
'Cause there's
a lot to do. Okay?

01:14:31.065 --> 01:14:32.054
Good.

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:53.814
Here you go.

01:14:56.123 --> 01:14:57.112
Hello.

01:15:12.273 --> 01:15:13.331
Here you go.

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:16.772
How come no one's in the water?

01:15:16.844 --> 01:15:18.141
We brought all these boards.

01:15:18.212 --> 01:15:19.338
Still petrified.

01:15:19.981 --> 01:15:21.812
Is it safe?
Yeah.

01:15:25.953 --> 01:15:27.215
Oh!

01:15:27.288 --> 01:15:29.449
Something's missing, yeah?

01:15:29.524 --> 01:15:32.960
They said he wandered up a
few days after the tsunami.

01:15:33.027 --> 01:15:34.016
What's his name?

01:15:34.095 --> 01:15:35.460
They don't know.

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:37.930
He hasn't said a word,
he won't even smile.

01:15:41.936 --> 01:15:44.461
Hey, do you want
to go in the water?

01:15:46.107 --> 01:15:49.167
Do you want to go out to
the ocean and go swimming?

01:15:49.243 --> 01:15:50.267
No?

01:16:03.291 --> 01:16:04.451
Hey, can I borrow your board?

01:16:04.525 --> 01:16:05.822
Yeah.

01:16:07.628 --> 01:16:08.959
Thank you.

01:16:11.399 --> 01:16:12.388
Thanks.

01:18:09.383 --> 01:18:11.908
They say the Lord
works in mysterious ways.

01:18:12.453 --> 01:18:14.819
I say that's an understatement.

01:18:14.889 --> 01:18:17.323
Who would have thought
that teaching a kid to surf

01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:19.018
would teach me
that surfing isn't

01:18:19.093 --> 01:18:21.493
the most important
thing in the world?

01:18:21.562 --> 01:18:23.826
And that something else is.

01:18:23.898 --> 01:18:24.990
Love.

01:18:25.332 --> 01:18:27.129
Bigger than any tidal wave.

01:18:27.201 --> 01:18:29.328
More powerful than any fear.

01:18:34.175 --> 01:18:35.437
Hey, I'm home!

01:18:35.509 --> 01:18:36.635
Hey, there she is.

01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:37.700
How was your trip?

01:18:37.778 --> 01:18:38.767
Great.

01:18:38.846 --> 01:18:40.438
What's all this stuff?

01:18:40.514 --> 01:18:42.914
Oh, you know,
just a little fan mail.

01:18:42.983 --> 01:18:44.883
Went ahead and sorted
it out by country.

01:18:44.952 --> 01:18:46.817
Are you serious?
Yup.

01:18:47.321 --> 01:18:50.882
And apparently, you are
very popular in Madagascar.

01:18:50.958 --> 01:18:52.118
No way.

01:18:52.193 --> 01:18:54.491
"Dear Bethany.
My name is Stephanie Bolt,

01:18:54.562 --> 01:18:56.621
"I'm 11 years old
and I go to Northcross

01:18:56.697 --> 01:18:58.688
"Intermediate School
in New Zealand."

01:18:58.766 --> 01:19:00.290
People are so amazing.

01:19:00.501 --> 01:19:03.470
There's an eighth grader from
North Carolina, who lost his arm.

01:19:04.371 --> 01:19:06.999
Logan, and he says
he's gonna try out

01:19:07.074 --> 01:19:09.133
for his school soccer
team because of me.

01:19:10.177 --> 01:19:13.237
And he's rooting for me
in my next competition.

01:19:14.648 --> 01:19:15.706
I mean, I don't understand,

01:19:15.783 --> 01:19:17.910
I totally blew it at regionals.

01:19:17.985 --> 01:19:19.577
Why would they
want me to compete?

01:19:21.021 --> 01:19:22.352
You tried.

01:19:23.624 --> 01:19:27.924
And apparently, Dylan and
Stephanie like that.

01:19:38.739 --> 01:19:41.333
Hey, Dad.
I need your help.

01:19:43.344 --> 01:19:44.333
Name it.

01:19:44.411 --> 01:19:46.743
I think I want to compete.

01:19:48.983 --> 01:19:50.211
You sure?

01:19:51.652 --> 01:19:52.676
You don't have to.

01:19:52.987 --> 01:19:54.181
I'll take it heat by heat.

01:19:57.391 --> 01:19:58.483
Okay.

01:19:58.959 --> 01:20:01.393
So we need to
figure out something.

01:20:01.462 --> 01:20:03.987
Some way so when I duck
dive, I don't get pounded.

01:20:04.832 --> 01:20:05.821
Yeah.

01:20:08.502 --> 01:20:12.165
You mean something like this?

01:20:17.411 --> 01:20:18.400
Yeah.

01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:44.000
You sure she can
use it in competition?

01:20:44.071 --> 01:20:46.335
Sure. Judges don't score on
how you get out to the waves.

01:20:46.407 --> 01:20:49.308
They only care what you
do when you catch one.

01:20:52.413 --> 01:20:54.438
Go ahead, say it.

01:20:56.784 --> 01:20:57.842
I'm a genius.

01:20:58.752 --> 01:21:00.151
You are...
Come on, say it.

01:21:00.654 --> 01:21:02.121
Tom, you're a genius!

01:21:02.189 --> 01:21:04.157
Genius.
You're very smart.

01:21:05.192 --> 01:21:06.955
Genius.
Come on, you know it.

01:21:07.027 --> 01:21:08.756
You're cute. You're very cute.
Genius. Genius.

01:21:10.397 --> 01:21:11.421
Hey.
Hey.

01:21:11.498 --> 01:21:12.965
Remember me?
No.

01:21:13.367 --> 01:21:16.302
That's really nice.
Best friends since birth, nothing.

01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:17.928
No. Nothing.
Good. Good sign.

01:21:19.306 --> 01:21:20.739
Hey, thanks for coming.

01:21:20.808 --> 01:21:22.537
Thanks for calling.

01:21:23.978 --> 01:21:25.639
I'm sorry I snapped
at you at regionals.

01:21:25.713 --> 01:21:26.702
Me, too.

01:21:27.815 --> 01:21:29.373
I miss you.
Me, too.

01:21:30.718 --> 01:21:32.549
Friends?
Of course.

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:27.529
Hey, Bethany!

01:22:28.842 --> 01:22:32.437
I saw you surfing out there this morning.
You were amazing.

01:22:32.513 --> 01:22:33.878
Maybe for a girl with one arm.

01:22:33.948 --> 01:22:35.279
By any standard.

01:22:35.349 --> 01:22:37.715
As for one arm, that just
levels the playing field.

01:22:37.785 --> 01:22:39.878
All right, all right.
What do you want?

01:22:40.421 --> 01:22:41.945
I want you to dominate
at nationals.

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:48.620
Hey, Keoki, thanks.

01:22:49.663 --> 01:22:50.925
For what?

01:22:51.098 --> 01:22:53.794
Just for always showing up
for me, no matter what.

01:22:53.867 --> 01:22:55.596
Well, it's because
I care about you.

01:22:56.103 --> 01:22:58.367
I mean, even if you did miss
my last competition and all.

01:22:58.439 --> 01:23:00.168
I was in the hospital
you psycho.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.400
Excuses, excuses.

01:23:02.943 --> 01:23:04.274
Ah! Ow!

01:23:04.345 --> 01:23:06.074
Bethany, I'm sorry.
I wasn't even...

01:23:06.146 --> 01:23:07.135
Gotcha.

01:23:09.116 --> 01:23:10.378
Sucker!

01:23:11.518 --> 01:23:15.045
Welcome to the Rip Curl Junior
Nationals Surfing Championship.

01:23:15.122 --> 01:23:17.022
David Stanfield
along with Bo Hodge.

01:23:17.091 --> 01:23:18.922
And, Bo, we have
an exciting day today.

01:23:19.126 --> 01:23:21.594
We've got an excellent
day of surfing on hand.

01:23:21.662 --> 01:23:24.324
We're going to see the best amateur
surfers from around the country today.

01:23:24.398 --> 01:23:26.457
We have a panel of
four international judges

01:23:26.533 --> 01:23:28.091
watching this
national championship.

01:23:28.168 --> 01:23:29.465
High and low scores
are thrown out,

01:23:29.536 --> 01:23:31.504
but what are the judges
exactly looking for?

01:23:31.572 --> 01:23:33.301
Well, Dave,
we have 25-minute heats.

01:23:33.374 --> 01:23:36.309
Each rider is allowed to catch a
maximum of 10 waves per heat.

01:23:36.377 --> 01:23:38.902
The best two waves will be
tallied up for the final score.

01:23:38.979 --> 01:23:40.412
What the judges
are looking for:

01:23:40.481 --> 01:23:43.814
Style, flow and power and
control in radical maneuvers

01:23:43.884 --> 01:23:45.545
in the most critical
sections of the wave.

01:23:45.753 --> 01:23:47.618
Well, we have surf in the
six-to-eight-foot range,

01:23:47.688 --> 01:23:48.677
it looks like out there.

01:23:48.756 --> 01:23:50.553
What's key about
this six person heat

01:23:50.624 --> 01:23:53.024
is in fact that paddling
and positioning, right?

01:23:54.361 --> 01:23:57.091
These girls are tough, especially
Malina, you know that.

01:23:57.631 --> 01:23:58.962
The surf is big
out there today,

01:23:59.033 --> 01:24:00.557
so if you try to match
them wave for wave,

01:24:00.634 --> 01:24:02.534
you're just doing to wear yourself
out with all that paddling.

01:24:02.603 --> 01:24:03.695
Yeah.

01:24:03.771 --> 01:24:05.864
So don't take just any
wave that comes along.

01:24:06.774 --> 01:24:10.505
The greatest surfers, they
all have this sixth sense.

01:24:10.778 --> 01:24:12.939
They know when the
best waves are coming.

01:24:13.013 --> 01:24:15.243
They can feel it.
It's a gift.

01:24:16.483 --> 01:24:17.916
You have that gift, too.

01:24:17.985 --> 01:24:19.077
I do?

01:24:20.087 --> 01:24:22.180
Well, your mom's right, honey.
You are a little mermaid.

01:24:25.092 --> 01:24:29.461
You know that moment between
the sets when it's quiet

01:24:30.431 --> 01:24:32.058
and the waves haven't
even formed yet,

01:24:32.132 --> 01:24:34.100
it's just energy surging
through the water.

01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:38.497
Well, that's the time
to be patient.

01:24:40.174 --> 01:24:41.664
Listen to your instinct.

01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:43.698
Trust it.

01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:47.779
You'll know.

01:24:49.583 --> 01:24:50.607
Go get 'em.

01:24:50.851 --> 01:24:52.546
Malina! Malina!

01:24:52.619 --> 01:24:55.782
Over the past few months, Malina Birch
has dominated every heat she's surfed

01:24:55.856 --> 01:24:57.721
winning three
contests in a row.

01:24:57.791 --> 01:25:00.487
No one has come close.
She's by far the person to beat today.

01:25:02.062 --> 01:25:03.461
Bethany! Bethany!

01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:05.395
Don't worry, it's all
part of being sponsored.

01:25:05.466 --> 01:25:07.434
We love you, Bethany!

01:25:07.734 --> 01:25:09.361
I'm going to go
get the rash guards.

01:25:12.039 --> 01:25:13.028
What are you doing here?

01:25:13.674 --> 01:25:15.539
I'm surfing, same as you.

01:25:15.676 --> 01:25:17.473
Well, I hope you don't
need to be rescued again.

01:25:18.445 --> 01:25:20.572
Actually, Malina,
I wanted to thank you.

01:25:21.081 --> 01:25:22.343
For what?

01:25:22.616 --> 01:25:25.483
Just for never taking it easy on me.
It means a lot.

01:25:27.221 --> 01:25:28.210
You ready?

01:25:29.089 --> 01:25:30.181
Okay.

01:25:32.326 --> 01:25:34.294
Bethany Hamilton's
appearance here

01:25:34.361 --> 01:25:36.295
is truly a remarkable comeback.

01:25:36.363 --> 01:25:39.025
Against all odds,
she has earned her spot

01:25:39.099 --> 01:25:40.964
into the National
Championships.

01:25:41.034 --> 01:25:42.524
Everyone in
attendance is hopeful

01:25:42.603 --> 01:25:44.571
that Bethany has
a great contest.

01:25:44.638 --> 01:25:48.438
But at the highest level of
competition, there are no free rides.

01:25:48.509 --> 01:25:50.272
We begin with our first
round of competition.

01:25:51.478 --> 01:25:52.877
And there's the horn.
The first heat is underway.

01:26:01.855 --> 01:26:03.015
Yes!

01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:10.719
Yes!

01:26:50.971 --> 01:26:52.165
Can you believe that?

01:26:58.845 --> 01:27:01.245
Advancing into the
finals by 2/10's of a point,

01:27:01.315 --> 01:27:03.408
the big story is
Bethany Hamilton.

01:27:03.483 --> 01:27:07.044
She was looking for a 7.2 and
scored a 7.4 on her last wave.

01:27:07.454 --> 01:27:08.978
She'll be wearing blue
out in the lineup

01:27:09.056 --> 01:27:11.650
with her good friend, wearing
pink, Alana Blanchard.

01:27:11.725 --> 01:27:13.989
And their competitors,
black, Malina Birch.

01:27:14.061 --> 01:27:18.054
Yellow, Leila Hurst. White, NagÃ©
Melamed, and in orange Kelia Moniz.

01:27:18.131 --> 01:27:20.929
And the judges are looking for
some progressive surfing today.

01:27:21.001 --> 01:27:23.333
That's right, Dave.
They'll have a 25-minute heat,

01:27:23.403 --> 01:27:24.927
be scored on 10 waves,

01:27:25.005 --> 01:27:27.200
but they'll keep their best
two waves for the final score

01:27:27.274 --> 01:27:28.969
on the zero to ten point range.

01:27:29.042 --> 01:27:31.203
And there's the horn
and the heat is underway.

01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:48.118
Yeah!

01:27:48.195 --> 01:27:51.392
There's NagÃ© Melamed.
She scores two vertical turns,

01:27:51.465 --> 01:27:53.558
and the judges
give her a 6. 75,

01:27:53.634 --> 01:27:55.261
and what a great
start to this heat.

01:27:57.537 --> 01:28:00.165
Alana Blanchard
picking up a set wave.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.101
Works her way down the line.

01:28:02.175 --> 01:28:04.439
Snaps a big turn off the top.

01:28:04.511 --> 01:28:08.709
Runs around her competitor
with an aggressive reentry.

01:28:08.782 --> 01:28:11.148
And pink cracks
the lip one more time.

01:28:11.218 --> 01:28:12.651
Great run, Alana!

01:28:13.487 --> 01:28:16.320
Situation with fifteen
minutes remaining in the heat,

01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:20.326
surfer in orange, Kelia
Moniz, you have a 5.4.

01:28:20.794 --> 01:28:24.696
Surfer in white, NagÃ©
Melamed, you have a 6. 75.

01:28:25.098 --> 01:28:26.827
Surfer in pink,
Alana Blanchard,

01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.561
you are in first
place with a 7.0.

01:28:28.635 --> 01:28:29.624
Way to go, Alana!

01:28:30.570 --> 01:28:31.559
Go!

01:28:38.879 --> 01:28:43.145
Bo, Hamilton goes down hard in
the impact zone, and she is struggling.

01:28:44.518 --> 01:28:46.884
That's okay.
You'll get another one!

01:28:47.087 --> 01:28:48.452
Stay in there,
stay in there, Bethany.

01:28:49.423 --> 01:28:50.447
Take a look at this.

01:28:50.524 --> 01:28:53.960
We've got four competitors
scratching for this wave.

01:28:54.027 --> 01:28:56.757
And surfer in black
takes control of the peak.

01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:58.320
Birch on the
nice take off.

01:28:58.398 --> 01:29:00.161
She sprays Bethany!

01:29:05.405 --> 01:29:06.736
Great off the top!

01:29:10.177 --> 01:29:12.270
Birch snaps under the lip.

01:29:13.146 --> 01:29:15.205
Banks it off the white
water one more time.

01:29:15.282 --> 01:29:16.544
Man, she is on fire today.

01:29:16.616 --> 01:29:20.780
One away. Malina Birch has scored
a 9.25 according to the judges,

01:29:20.854 --> 01:29:22.412
and that is a high score.

01:29:22.489 --> 01:29:24.923
Now she is in the lead,
Blanchard in second.

01:29:24.991 --> 01:29:27.619
Melamed in third,
Leila Hurst in fourth,

01:29:27.694 --> 01:29:31.824
Bethany Hamilton is in fifth, and
in sixth right now is Moniz.

01:29:32.866 --> 01:29:36.393
Hamilton with a stall
and goes over the falls.

01:29:37.571 --> 01:29:38.663
Is she going to be all right?

01:29:38.739 --> 01:29:40.798
It's okay. Everybody gets
caught every once in a while.

01:29:40.874 --> 01:29:41.863
She can handle it.

01:29:44.111 --> 01:29:46.238
Precious time on the
clock right now, Dave.

01:29:46.313 --> 01:29:49.339
And it looks like Alana is paddling
into a big wave on the outside.

01:29:49.416 --> 01:29:52.943
Ooh! And Alana Blanchard
takes a spill there, too.

01:29:53.019 --> 01:29:56.182
Ladies and gentlemen, Malina
Birch is up and riding again.

01:29:56.256 --> 01:29:58.690
This girl's a wave
magnet today, Bo.

01:29:58.759 --> 01:30:00.590
She certainly is in
rhythm with the ocean.

01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:03.254
Way above the pack here
in today's competition.

01:30:09.035 --> 01:30:12.163
Malina Birch has just scored
a 9.5 on her last wave.

01:30:12.239 --> 01:30:14.400
That is the highest
wave of the contest.

01:30:14.474 --> 01:30:15.873
She's going to need
two nine-plus waves

01:30:15.942 --> 01:30:17.569
to even come close
to catching Malina.

01:30:17.644 --> 01:30:18.941
She's got less
than five minutes.

01:30:19.179 --> 01:30:22.148
With time winding down
and no waves on the horizon,

01:30:22.215 --> 01:30:25.082
our surfers are anxious
to get a final score.

01:30:25.152 --> 01:30:29.054
Look for the girls to scramble for any
solid wave before the hooter blows.

01:30:35.195 --> 01:30:37.163
Check this out,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:38.822
There's some
energy out in back.

01:30:38.899 --> 01:30:41.925
Looks like the girls have spotted
something on the horizon.

01:30:42.002 --> 01:30:44.232
Paddle, Bethany.
Paddle hard.

01:30:47.174 --> 01:30:48.505
Bo, take a look at this.

01:30:48.575 --> 01:30:51.738
Birch and Hamilton
paddle-battle out the back.

01:30:52.212 --> 01:30:54.510
And Hamilton really needs
to beat her to the inside.

01:30:54.581 --> 01:30:55.570
If she's got
a chance here today.

01:30:55.649 --> 01:30:56.946
Come on, Bethany,
stay ahead of her!

01:30:58.718 --> 01:31:00.709
Don't let up!
You got her!

01:31:03.123 --> 01:31:07.253
Unbelievable, Bo, all Malina's got
to do is block Bethany Hamilton

01:31:07.327 --> 01:31:11.559
from getting to the inside and
she's got this contest in the bag.

01:31:17.804 --> 01:31:18.828
Paddle hard!

01:31:20.307 --> 01:31:23.105
Birch is still blocking
Hamilton from the inside.

01:31:23.176 --> 01:31:25.406
I don't know how she's going
to catch this wave, Bo.

01:31:25.612 --> 01:31:26.601
Paddle!

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.443
Dave, we've got a
paddle-battle to the outside.

01:31:28.515 --> 01:31:29.743
It's Birch.
It's Hamilton.

01:31:31.051 --> 01:31:32.177
She's got her on the ropes.

01:31:32.252 --> 01:31:35.050
Can Bethany catch the wave?
This is her last chance.

01:31:49.169 --> 01:31:50.158
Yes!
Yes!

01:31:52.072 --> 01:31:53.505
She's got the wave, David!

01:31:53.573 --> 01:31:56.303
This is the one she's been
waiting for all contest long.

01:31:56.376 --> 01:31:58.435
Absolutely unbelievable.

01:31:58.512 --> 01:32:00.946
Bethany Hamilton duck
dives under Malina Birch

01:32:01.014 --> 01:32:03.346
while Birch is still out there
looking for another ride.

01:32:15.161 --> 01:32:16.856
Sick one, Bethany!

01:32:17.130 --> 01:32:20.429
That was an unbelievable
ride by Bethany Hamilton.

01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:25.233
The judges
give her a 9. 7.

01:32:28.008 --> 01:32:29.270
It's the highest
score of the heat!

01:32:29.342 --> 01:32:30.331
Wow!

01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:31.502
But she's still fifth!
All right, guys,

01:32:31.578 --> 01:32:32.602
she needs one more, one more.

01:33:05.145 --> 01:33:07.739
Bethany Hamilton is paddling
outside the lineup.

01:33:07.814 --> 01:33:09.782
What does she see?

01:33:09.849 --> 01:33:12.147
I don't know, Dave, but no
one's been paddling out

01:33:12.218 --> 01:33:13.480
in that area
all during the contest.

01:33:13.553 --> 01:33:14.815
Why is she so far out?

01:33:14.888 --> 01:33:16.014
What, is she giving up?

01:33:16.489 --> 01:33:17.956
I don't know.

01:33:18.491 --> 01:33:20.254
She feels something.

01:33:25.498 --> 01:33:27.227
What are you doing?

01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:29.734
Dave, there's only one minute
remaining on the clock.

01:33:29.803 --> 01:33:31.464
It is dead flat.

01:33:31.538 --> 01:33:33.870
The contest
may be already over.

01:33:38.878 --> 01:33:40.072
Why is she stopping?

01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:41.569
There's nothing out there.

01:33:41.648 --> 01:33:42.637
Not yet.

01:33:43.049 --> 01:33:46.917
Only 45 seconds on the clock
and no set waves on the horizon.

01:33:46.987 --> 01:33:49.421
This contest may be over, Bo.

01:33:57.230 --> 01:33:59.596
We are counting down
to end this final.

01:33:59.666 --> 01:34:02.100
Just 30 seconds
left on the clock.

01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:11.302
Big bomb on the outside.

01:34:13.813 --> 01:34:15.644
Fifteen seconds
remaining.

01:34:15.715 --> 01:34:17.273
Everybody else
is too far inside.

01:34:17.784 --> 01:34:20.810
The Rip Curl Nationals,
10 seconds to go!

01:34:20.887 --> 01:34:24.482
And there is Bethany Hamilton with
an amazing wave out the back.

01:34:24.557 --> 01:34:25.649
Will this be enough?

01:34:32.265 --> 01:34:34.460
She is paddling
and here comes the wave.

01:34:36.069 --> 01:34:37.331
She's taken the drop!

01:35:42.402 --> 01:35:46.099
An amazing barrel for Bethany Hamilton.
Perfect positioning.

01:35:46.172 --> 01:35:47.298
Was she up before the horn?

01:35:47.474 --> 01:35:48.702
They have to count it.

01:35:55.148 --> 01:35:56.706
Way to go, Bethany!

01:35:56.783 --> 01:35:57.772
Yeah!

01:36:25.678 --> 01:36:28.044
Unbelievable.
Bethany Hamilton's

01:36:28.114 --> 01:36:30.241
amazing wave at the
end does not count.

01:36:30.316 --> 01:36:31.806
She stood up after the horn.
- What?

01:36:31.885 --> 01:36:33.147
So she gets no score.

01:36:33.219 --> 01:36:35.483
Malina Birch,
your new National Champion.

01:36:35.555 --> 01:36:36.544
No!

01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:38.885
It's okay, Dad.
It's okay.

01:36:38.958 --> 01:36:39.947
But it didn't count.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:41.749
It counted.

01:36:43.730 --> 01:36:44.822
It totally counted.

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.600
Yes, it did.

01:36:51.938 --> 01:36:53.838
I'm still checking
that video. Noah!

01:37:04.184 --> 01:37:06.152
Hey. You okay?

01:37:06.219 --> 01:37:07.243
Very. Are you?

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:08.309
Yeah.

01:37:09.155 --> 01:37:10.144
Yeah, I think so.

01:37:12.292 --> 01:37:13.418
What am I supposed to do now?

01:37:15.795 --> 01:37:19.253
You're supposed to
enjoy it. All of it.

01:37:19.999 --> 01:37:22.092
For the rest of your life.

01:37:29.375 --> 01:37:32.708
In fifth place, Bethany Hamilton!
Good job.

01:37:33.012 --> 01:37:34.240
Yeah! Bethany!

01:37:34.314 --> 01:37:37.078
And in fourth place,
Leila Hurst.

01:37:37.417 --> 01:37:39.851
Third place, NagÃ© Melamed.

01:37:40.587 --> 01:37:42.953
Second place, Alana Blanchard.

01:37:43.022 --> 01:37:44.011
Way to go, baby!

01:37:44.257 --> 01:37:47.385
And in first place,
Malina Birch.

01:37:52.332 --> 01:37:53.731
Hey.

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:56.428
Hey, Malina. Great job.

01:37:56.502 --> 01:37:57.628
You're a tough opponent.

01:37:58.171 --> 01:38:01.629
Bethany Hamilton,
nobody is as tough as you.

01:38:03.509 --> 01:38:05.170
Get up here.
Come on. Come on.

01:38:07.113 --> 01:38:09.445
I'd like to share this win
with Bethany Hamilton.

01:38:09.949 --> 01:38:12.440
Because the judges may not
have counted that last wave,

01:38:13.419 --> 01:38:14.750
but I did.

01:38:15.889 --> 01:38:17.083
Bethany.

01:38:26.099 --> 01:38:27.088
Bethany! Bethany!

01:38:27.166 --> 01:38:29.259
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just back off, okay.

01:38:29.535 --> 01:38:31.400
It's okay.
Are you sure?

01:38:31.838 --> 01:38:33.396
You don't have to talk to them.

01:38:33.473 --> 01:38:37.170
Yeah, but what about Dylan
or Logan or Stephanie?

01:38:37.243 --> 01:38:38.870
What if they're watching?

01:38:38.945 --> 01:38:41.505
Bethany, I'm from
Transworld Surf magazine.

01:38:41.581 --> 01:38:43.208
Are you upset
you didn't win today?

01:38:43.283 --> 01:38:45.683
I didn't come to win.
I came to surf.

01:38:45.752 --> 01:38:47.344
Bethany, I just
wanted to ask you

01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:49.684
if you could go
back to that day

01:38:49.756 --> 01:38:51.917
and not have gone surfing,
would you do it?

01:38:55.161 --> 01:38:57.527
I wouldn't change
what happened to me,

01:38:57.597 --> 01:39:01.931
because then I wouldn't have this
chance in front of all of you.

01:39:02.769 --> 01:39:05.397
This chance to
embrace more people

01:39:05.471 --> 01:39:07.268
than I ever could
have with two arms.

01:39:18.651 --> 01:39:20.516
I was born to surf.

01:39:20.586 --> 01:39:23.953
This is why I wake up at the
crack of dawn every day.

01:39:24.023 --> 01:39:26.548
This is why I endure
belly rashes, reef cuts,

01:39:26.626 --> 01:39:29.424
muscles so tired
they feel like noodles.

01:39:30.129 --> 01:39:32.962
And I've learned that
life is a lot like surfing.

01:39:33.032 --> 01:39:36.763
When you get caught in the impact
zone, you need to get right back up

01:39:36.836 --> 01:39:39.464
because you never know
what's over the next wave.

01:39:39.639 --> 01:39:43.268
And if you have faith,
anything is possible.

01:39:43.343 --> 01:39:44.935
Anything at all.

01:40:36.329 --> 01:40:38.160
Yeah, it was so much
fun just seeing him

01:40:38.231 --> 01:40:39.994
get better and better
on every wave

01:40:40.066 --> 01:40:43.832
and get up and ride all the way to the beach.
It was awesome.

01:40:43.970 --> 01:40:46.097
Throwing out
the ceremonial first pitch

01:40:46.172 --> 01:40:50.302
of the 2004 season
is Bethany Hamilton.

01:40:54.313 --> 01:40:55.302
Strike.

01:40:56.349 --> 01:40:57.373
Thank you, Bethany!

01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:04.021
I think I got my courage
from Jesus Christ.

01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:05.819
He says, "Be strong."

01:41:13.766 --> 01:41:15.529
You think you're
going to surf again?

01:41:15.601 --> 01:41:17.125
I think?

01:41:17.203 --> 01:41:19.967
I know I'm going to surf again.
