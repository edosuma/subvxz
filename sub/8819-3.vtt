Okay, okay.
The SS is not behind Keller's release.

00:50.843 --> 00:54.263
Okay, so Interpol isn't evil.
They're simply stupid.

You don't make a deal

that now we know what Keller's up to.

-We have leverage.
-As does he.

I've reached out to them, but they've
denied any knowledge of the operation.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.295
Well, we did some digging.

02:08.378 --> 02:11.381
Chances are Interpol are using
an RF ID tracking chip.

If we get close to Keller, we can
pinpoint his signal and track him too.

are scanned on arrival.

02:17.596 --> 02:18.764

02:19.097 --> 02:21.266
No, they must be switching the chip
on and off.

Which means
there's someone at the switch.

Keller has a handler.

It's not our concern.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.481
The four of us need to talk.

11:35.404 --> 11:36.780
It's good to see you again, Burkie.

11:37.114 --> 11:38.824
How's the wife?

11:38.907 --> 11:40.367
LUC: Shut your mouth, Matthew.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.494
PETER: Why don't we all sit down?

11:44.496 --> 11:49.251
The four us have the same goal.
So, we need to be working together.

11:49.418 --> 11:50.961
We can't be tripping over each other.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.422
I agree. Give me Neal and step aside.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.507
All right. Dream on, Inspector Clouseau.

11:55.632 --> 11:56.842
Neal is my CI.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.761
-Yes. One that you clearly can't control.
-(CHUCKLES)

11:59.970 --> 12:01.847
All right, all right. Politeness is over.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.225
Neal works for me.
You work with me or you're out.

12:05.309 --> 12:08.103
This is United States. This is FBI turf.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.565
And you know that you can't
take these guys down by yourself.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.818
-You underestimate me.
-No. You underestimate me.

12:15.694 --> 12:19.198
This can either be
a joint FBI and Interpol case

12:19.281 --> 12:20.657
or just FBI.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.869
Your choice.

12:28.957 --> 12:32.711
I know it doesn't have eyes,
but I swear it's staring at me.

12:33.462 --> 12:37.674
I know. It's definitely the most
unique gift I've gotten so far.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.134
Well, speaking of gifts.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.345
Wow. (CHUCKLES)

"How to Not Screw Up Motherhood."

12:47.559 --> 12:49.019
You were supposed to come over
and cheer me up, right?

12:49.102 --> 12:50.437
-I am here to cheer you up.
-(CHUCKLES)

12:50.521 --> 12:52.356
Because as hard
as having a baby was for me,

12:52.439 --> 12:56.360
and dear God, it was hard,
there was one big thing I wish I had.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.571
A partner.
And you have the best kind in Peter.

12:59.655 --> 13:00.864
Yeah.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.283
I do. I know.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.162
But will he be here when
I'm trying to get the baby's fever down?

13:07.996 --> 13:10.999
Am I gonna be going to all these
parent-teacher conferences by myself?

13:11.416 --> 13:15.504
I mean, Diana, don't get me wrong.
I know Peter's gonna love being a dad,

13:15.587 --> 13:17.130
but his job is very demanding.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.758
Sounds like you've got hormones
whispering in your ear.

13:19.842 --> 13:23.387
Trust me, I've been there.
But this is Peter we're talking about.

13:23.470 --> 13:27.015
He's gonna dedicate himself to fatherhood
like he did the FBI, and to you.

13:27.099 --> 13:28.517
-I know, but...
-It's gonna be okay.

13:28.684 --> 13:30.102
Having a baby changes everything.

13:30.185 --> 13:33.480
Just try not to let it change
what the two of you already have.

13:33.564 --> 13:34.690
Yeah.

13:49.705 --> 13:52.249
How were your adventures
in the janitorial night shift?

13:52.416 --> 13:57.296
Oh, a stark reminder that I shouldn't
touch doorknobs with my bare hands.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.380
Or tables.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.091
-Or anything, really.
-You get what we wanted?

14:01.216 --> 14:04.803
I scrubbed toilets at Atlas Tech
all night, want had nothing to do with it.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.139
But I did get what was needed.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.936
So, Amy's desk
sits outside the CEO's office.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.230
Down the hallway,
away from everything else,

14:15.314 --> 14:17.316
is this steel reinforced door.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.861
Which only opens to the appropriate
fingerprint and iris scan.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.696
So we need her to open the door for us.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.031
Without knowing she did it.

14:24.907 --> 14:27.743
Once we gain access
to the mainframe computer,

14:27.826 --> 14:30.871
we just drag and drop the Exodus file
onto this.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.916
And then we are in the wind,
with no one the wiser.

14:34.917 --> 14:39.004
Oh, thanks. Commode cleansing
always builds up my appetite.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.425
I hate to say it,
but I think we need Keller for this.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.303
Great. Afterwards,
I have a hen house he can guard.

14:46.595 --> 14:47.804
Peter was right.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.098
If we don't work together,
we'll trip over each other.

14:50.474 --> 14:51.600
So, what's your plan?

14:52.309 --> 14:53.519

15:03.779 --> 15:07.491
Since you can't leave your desk for lunch,
I thought I'd bring lunch to you.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.911
-(LAUGHS)
-WOMAN: That's sweet.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.413
Neal, I don't know what to say.

15:13.539 --> 15:17.793
Uh, say that you'll throw away
whatever that is supposed to be.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.712
-Happily.
-I hope I'm not overstepping, here.

15:21.505 --> 15:24.007
Oh, my God. Are you kidding?
This is amazing.

15:24.258 --> 15:26.218
Thank God my boss isn't here. (LAUGHS)

15:32.766 --> 15:34.726
Oh, my God. This is delicious.

15:34.810 --> 15:35.811
You think so?

15:36.645 --> 15:37.980
Thank you.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.529
-What is it?
-It's that guy.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.782
From yesterday, from the farmer's market.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.285
-You sure?
-I think so.

15:51.660 --> 15:55.539
I know every guard here, and I've not seen
that man since before yesterday.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.374
What do you think that means?

16:00.752 --> 16:02.045
I don't know.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.380
Maybe you should call security.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.177
There's no dial tone.

16:09.428 --> 16:11.430
Oh, my God.
What if he's trying to steal something?

16:11.680 --> 16:12.931
You guys are a tech firm, right?

16:13.015 --> 16:15.475
It's not like you keep
any valuables around.

16:15.559 --> 16:17.853
That's not necessarily true.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.730
And he was coming from the vault room.

16:20.314 --> 16:22.107
There's no way
he could've gotten in there.

16:22.191 --> 16:24.276
All right, do you want to check?
I'll stay here, keep an eye out.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.236
Thank you. I mean, I'm sure it's nothing.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.404
No, go ahead. Make sure...

16:27.487 --> 16:29.114
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

16:38.540 --> 16:39.583
NEAL: Amy!

16:40.167 --> 16:41.960
The phones are working.
You want me to call security?

16:44.087 --> 16:46.423
No, it's fine.
Everything's where it should be.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.349
Oh. Hello, 1970s.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.562
Looks like I brought a lightsaber
to a knife fight.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.816
This is not good.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.285
-PETER: Are we done?
-Not yet. Mozzie's on it.

17:15.369 --> 17:17.788
-What's a Mozzie?
-He's Caffrey's soul mate.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.456
We needed a third man.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.083
I wasn't gonna recruit
one of the Panthers.

17:21.166 --> 17:23.210
Besides, there's no one better than Moz.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.003
No secrets. That was our deal.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.339
All right, look.
You're working with the FBI.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.049
Not the other way around.

17:30.676 --> 17:32.052
Van dwellers, there's a problem.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.846
Did you copy the file or not?

17:34.137 --> 17:36.139
-I did not.
-Wait. It wasn't there?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.432
Well, there's a problem.

17:37.516 --> 17:41.144
The problem is that
this can't be copied onto this.

17:41.937 --> 17:43.146
So, I took the original.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.357
The only way to access the Exodus file

17:46.233 --> 17:48.360
is to go back to the future.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.822
PETER: That should have
never left the vault.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.867
If someone discovers this missing,
this operation is a bust.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.618
We got it out, we'll get it back in,

17:56.910 --> 17:58.662
after extracting the Exodus file.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.788
Good luck with that.

17:59.872 --> 18:03.959
This is a first generation Minnow disk.
State-of-the-art in 1971.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.837
Yeah, the primordial ooze
of magnetic storage.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.505
Holds a whopping 80 kilobytes.

18:08.630 --> 18:11.717
Which, in modern standards, is like using
a mini-van to haul a family of fleas.

18:11.842 --> 18:13.760
These early disks
were never marketed commercially,

18:13.844 --> 18:16.763
so you'll be hard-pressed to find a drive
that can read it or talk to it.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.140
They're out there.

-Why?
-Cold War era tech.

It's the new firewall.

and nuclear silos.

and use the girl to put it back.

is too secure to break back into.

You bring the disk over...

19:14.488 --> 19:17.032
You create a small diversion,
and I'll slip into her purse.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.367
And when she finds it?

19:18.450 --> 19:20.494
She puts it back where it belongs, right?

19:20.786 --> 19:22.371

-All of them in the U.S.

35:36.386 --> 35:38.931
DIANA: These right here,
airlines and corresponding plane numbers.

35:39.014 --> 35:40.307
PETER: International airlines.

35:40.390 --> 35:43.393
So, whatever they're transporting
is going in and out of the country.

35:43.477 --> 35:45.145
DIANA: We haven't figured out
what these numbers mean yet.

35:45.229 --> 35:47.648
But we think is has something to do
with where the shipment ends up.

35:47.731 --> 35:49.191
If everything is chosen at random...

35:49.274 --> 35:52.236
No one knows who's flying or where,
until the algorithm chooses.

35:52.319 --> 35:56.490
Built in this kind of secrecy,
it must be a very high-value target.

35:56.573 --> 35:59.159
Yeah. Without planning,
it's almost an impossible heist.

36:00.410 --> 36:01.787
Unless you have the algorithm.

36:01.870 --> 36:05.415
JONES: Yeah. Which, thanks to
Neal and Keller, the Pink Panthers do.

36:05.916 --> 36:07.292
Excellent work, you two.

36:09.920 --> 36:10.963
Luc.

36:20.514 --> 36:22.140
Have a seat.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.318
You stole evidence from my house.

36:33.902 --> 36:35.863
I called Interpol,
hoping I could rein you in.

36:36.029 --> 36:37.990
When I mentioned your name,

36:38.073 --> 36:40.367
they acted like
I was reporting an Elvis sighting.

36:40.701 --> 36:42.452
You're upset. I don't understand.

36:42.870 --> 36:46.123
Thanks to my CI,
Woodford has a copy of the Exodus file,

36:46.206 --> 36:48.458
and the Atlas Tech stayed quiet. Win-win.

36:48.542 --> 36:50.711
You're CI almost killed an innocent girl.

36:50.794 --> 36:53.547
My CI is the only reason
you and I aren't both mall cops right now.

36:54.089 --> 36:55.507
Does it matter anymore?

36:55.591 --> 36:57.801
I will not risk an innocent life.

36:57.885 --> 37:01.180
And I will do whatever is necessary
to bring down the Panthers.

37:01.513 --> 37:02.598
Not on my watch.

37:03.056 --> 37:04.725
Then when you're not watching.

37:06.727 --> 37:10.856
How about I arrest you right now
for interfering with an FBI investigation?

37:11.315 --> 37:13.483
Interpol said you didn't exist.

37:13.567 --> 37:16.737
We have places we can put you
where you don't.

37:23.410 --> 37:26.413
Hmm, a slap. Very Joan Crawford.

37:26.496 --> 37:29.958
I deserved it.
I never should have put Amy in harm's way.

37:30.042 --> 37:31.960
-Oh, you mean Keller's way.
-Even worse.

37:32.169 --> 37:34.505
There is no worse. Except maybe Luc.

37:34.588 --> 37:37.341
He has me seriously
reconsidering my Francophilia.

37:37.758 --> 37:40.344
Well, at least now we know
he's not afraid to get his hands dirty.

37:40.427 --> 37:44.473
Uh, he's a Frenchman who doesn't
drink wine. He's capable of anything.

37:46.850 --> 37:50.437
I never wanted to be this guy, Moz.
Someone who hurts innocent people.

37:53.565 --> 37:55.442
The con man's quandary.

37:56.109 --> 37:59.488
Maybe that's why I like working
for the FBI. We only con bad people.

38:00.822 --> 38:04.117
I still ascribe to W.C. Fields' mantra,

38:04.535 --> 38:07.329
"You can't cheat an honest man."

38:07.412 --> 38:08.705
Amy was the exception.

38:09.081 --> 38:10.082
She's a good person.

38:10.165 --> 38:13.544
Spent years trying to build a future,
and I stole that from her.

38:13.627 --> 38:15.587
Or you could look at it the other way.

38:15.963 --> 38:17.089
What other way?

38:17.214 --> 38:19.424
If you hadn't been there
to protect her from Keller,

38:19.508 --> 38:21.134
she wouldn't have had a future to steal.

38:24.471 --> 38:25.639
Honey!

38:27.099 --> 38:28.308
(GROANS)

38:31.144 --> 38:33.146
Hey! New in town, sailor?

38:33.230 --> 38:34.982
-You look hot.
-(CHUCKLES)

38:35.065 --> 38:37.276
-Mmm! Come here.
-Oh, no, no, no.

38:37.359 --> 38:40.237
That's gonna cost you
a very expensive dinner downtown.

38:40.445 --> 38:41.572
-On a Tuesday?
-Yes.

38:41.655 --> 38:43.240
We have six months to be spontaneous.

38:44.199 --> 38:45.242
-The baby.
-Yes.

38:45.367 --> 38:49.037
It's going to set our schedule.
So we have 8:00 reservations at Babbo.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.123
Let's be late.

38:51.874 --> 38:53.876
-Hey, hon.
-I'm being spontaneous.

38:55.586 --> 38:58.338
You're gonna be here for us, right?
Me and the baby.

38:59.089 --> 39:00.215
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

39:01.508 --> 39:03.635
I know you do important work.

39:03.719 --> 39:05.512
But being a father is important too.

39:07.014 --> 39:10.392
I've spent years dreaming of being a dad.

39:10.475 --> 39:13.187
And I don't wanna miss one second of it.

39:13.270 --> 39:16.565
I am gonna love watching you be a mom.

39:17.524 --> 39:19.818
We're gonna be great parents.

39:19.902 --> 39:22.112
Let's just not lose this.

39:22.696 --> 39:23.780
Us.

39:24.489 --> 39:27.993
What we had when I held up that sign
and we smiled at each other,

39:28.076 --> 39:29.203
across Houston Street.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.371
That is impossible.

39:34.917 --> 39:36.710
Let's be really late.

39:39.213 --> 39:41.590
-Ooh! Okay.
-(ELIZABETH GIGGLES)

39:55.270 --> 39:56.647
Chess, huh?

39:57.689 --> 39:59.983
Well, it's just like old times.

40:00.067 --> 40:03.612
Don't sit. It's more challenging
playing against myself.

40:06.073 --> 40:08.408
Is that right? Then why the call, Neal?

40:09.409 --> 40:10.452
Amy.

40:11.245 --> 40:14.081
Breaking into her apartment,
going for your knife.

40:14.748 --> 40:17.000
-It was a very fat line you crossed.
-Yeah?

40:17.417 --> 40:20.462
Well forgive me, Caffrey, for I have
sinned. What is... What's my penance?

40:21.088 --> 40:22.422
-You being you.
-(CHUCKLES)

40:23.423 --> 40:25.717
But if you try anything like that again,

40:26.301 --> 40:27.344
I throw my grenade.

40:28.345 --> 40:30.639
And I throw mine, and we're both dead.
So where's the sweet spot?

40:31.598 --> 40:33.225
I don't need one.

40:35.394 --> 40:37.896
Collateral damage
is a con man's by-product, Caffrey.

40:39.481 --> 40:41.149
See, guys like us,

40:41.984 --> 40:43.110
we hurt people around us.

40:43.986 --> 40:45.612
I'm not a guy like you.

40:46.280 --> 40:49.199
You keep telling yourself that,
sweetheart.

40:50.117 --> 40:52.744
So what? You got it all figured out, huh?

40:53.203 --> 40:54.872
We take down the Panthers,
we get our freedom.

40:54.955 --> 40:57.082
Then what? Live happily ever after?

40:57.165 --> 40:59.501
-Yeah. Something like that.
-Something like that?

41:00.627 --> 41:03.672
Yeah, you're living
in a fairytale, Caffrey.

41:04.506 --> 41:07.134
No matter what happens, me and you,

41:07.217 --> 41:08.218
we're hunted men.

41:09.636 --> 41:11.513
We take down Woodford and his crew,

41:12.472 --> 41:14.057
it's never over.

41:14.683 --> 41:16.560
Even in prison,
they'll come looking for us.

41:16.643 --> 41:20.105
And their reach, my friend,
it is far and it is wide.

41:21.315 --> 41:24.818
And the Panthers, Neal, they don't stop
looking for rats until they're dead.

41:25.444 --> 41:27.446
Until then, guess who they go after.

41:28.155 --> 41:30.032
People closest to you.

41:31.450 --> 41:33.118
And they'd make it hurt, Caffrey.

41:33.202 --> 41:37.206
They'd make it hurt so bad
that you'd wish that they'd found you.

41:41.293 --> 41:45.172
So, you enjoy this freedom
you're working so hard to get.

41:45.255 --> 41:47.674
'Cause when
you're footloose and fancy-free,

41:48.050 --> 41:50.093
those people that you love so much,

41:50.677 --> 41:51.887
are on death row.
