Okay, okay.
The SS is not behind Keller's release.

00:50.843 --> 00:54.263
Okay, so Interpol isn't evil.
They're simply stupid.

that now we know what Keller's up to.

denied any knowledge of the operation.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.295
Well, we did some digging.

02:08.378 --> 02:11.381
Chances are Interpol are using
an RF ID tracking chip.

pinpoint his signal and track him too.

are scanned on arrival.

02:17.596 --> 02:18.764

02:19.097 --> 02:21.266
No, they must be switching the chip
on and off.

there's someone at the switch.

It's not our concern.

The four of us need to talk.

11:35.404 --> 11:36.780
It's good to see you again, Burkie.

11:37.114 --> 11:38.824
How's the wife?

11:38.907 --> 11:40.367
LUC: Shut your mouth, Matthew.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.494
PETER: Why don't we all sit down?

11:44.496 --> 11:49.251
The four us have the same goal.
So, we need to be working together.

11:49.418 --> 11:50.961
We can't be tripping over each other.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.422
I agree. Give me Neal and step aside.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.507
All right. Dream on, Inspector Clouseau.

11:55.632 --> 11:56.842
Neal is my CI.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.761
-Yes. One that you clearly can't control.
-(CHUCKLES)

11:59.970 --> 12:01.847
All right, all right. Politeness is over.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.225
Neal works for me.
You work with me or you're out.

12:05.309 --> 12:08.103
This is United States. This is FBI turf.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.565
And you know that you can't
take these guys down by yourself.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.818
-You underestimate me.
-No. You underestimate me.

12:15.694 --> 12:19.198
This can either be
a joint FBI and Interpol case

12:19.281 --> 12:20.657
or just FBI.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.869
Your choice.

12:28.957 --> 12:32.711
I know it doesn't have eyes,
but I swear it's staring at me.

12:33.462 --> 12:37.674
I know. It's definitely the most
unique gift I've gotten so far.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.134
Well, speaking of gifts.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.345
Wow. (CHUCKLES)

12:45.599 --> 12:47.476
"How to Not Screw Up Motherhood."

12:47.559 --> 12:49.019
You were supposed to come over
and cheer me up, right?

12:49.102 --> 12:50.437
-I am here to cheer you up.
-(CHUCKLES)

12:50.521 --> 12:52.356
Because as hard
as having a baby was for me,

12:52.439 --> 12:56.360
and dear God, it was hard,
there was one big thing I wish I had.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.571
A partner.
And you have the best kind in Peter.

12:59.655 --> 13:00.864
Yeah.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.283
I do. I know.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.162
But will he be here when
I'm trying to get the baby's fever down?

13:07.996 --> 13:10.999
Am I gonna be going to all these
parent-teacher conferences by myself?

13:11.416 --> 13:15.504
I mean, Diana, don't get me wrong.
I know Peter's gonna love being a dad,

13:15.587 --> 13:17.130
but his job is very demanding.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.758
Sounds like you've got hormones
whispering in your ear.

13:19.842 --> 13:23.387
Trust me, I've been there.
But this is Peter we're talking about.

13:23.470 --> 13:27.015
He's gonna dedicate himself to fatherhood
like he did the FBI, and to you.

13:27.099 --> 13:28.517
-I know, but...
-It's gonna be okay.

13:28.684 --> 13:30.102
Having a baby changes everything.

13:30.185 --> 13:33.480
Just try not to let it change
what the two of you already have.

13:33.564 --> 13:34.690
Yeah.

13:49.705 --> 13:52.249
How were your adventures
in the janitorial night shift?

13:52.416 --> 13:57.296
Oh, a stark reminder that I shouldn't
touch doorknobs with my bare hands.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.380
Or tables.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.091
-Or anything, really.
-You get what we wanted?

14:01.216 --> 14:04.803
I scrubbed toilets at Atlas Tech
all night, want had nothing to do with it.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.139
But I did get what was needed.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.936
So, Amy's desk
sits outside the CEO's office.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.230
Down the hallway,
away from everything else,

14:15.314 --> 14:17.316
is this steel reinforced door.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.861
Which only opens to the appropriate
fingerprint and iris scan.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.696
So we need her to open the door for us.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.031
Without knowing she did it.

14:24.907 --> 14:27.743
Once we gain access
to the mainframe computer,

14:27.826 --> 14:30.871
we just drag and drop the Exodus file
onto this.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.916
And then we are in the wind,
with no one the wiser.

14:34.917 --> 14:39.004
Oh, thanks. Commode cleansing
always builds up my appetite.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.425
I hate to say it,
but I think we need Keller for this.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.303
Great. Afterwards,
I have a hen house he can guard.

14:46.595 --> 14:47.804
Peter was right.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.098
If we don't work together,
we'll trip over each other.

14:50.474 --> 14:51.600
So, what's your plan?

14:52.309 --> 14:53.519
You're eating it.

(MICROWAVE DINGS)

15:02.694 --> 15:03.695

15:03.779 --> 15:07.491
Since you can't leave your desk for lunch,
I thought I'd bring lunch to you.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.911
-(LAUGHS)
-WOMAN: That's sweet.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.413
Neal, I don't know what to say.

15:13.539 --> 15:17.793
Uh, say that you'll throw away
whatever that is supposed to be.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.712
-Happily.
-I hope I'm not overstepping, here.

15:21.505 --> 15:24.007
Oh, my God. Are you kidding?
This is amazing.

15:24.258 --> 15:26.218
Thank God my boss isn't here. (LAUGHS)

15:32.766 --> 15:34.726
Oh, my God. This is delicious.

15:34.810 --> 15:35.811
You think so?

15:36.645 --> 15:37.980
Thank you.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.529
-What is it?
-It's that guy.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.782
From yesterday, from the farmer's market.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.285
-You sure?
-I think so.

15:51.660 --> 15:55.539
I know every guard here, and I've not seen
that man since before yesterday.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.374
What do you think that means?

16:00.752 --> 16:02.045
I don't know.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.380
Maybe you should call security.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.177
There's no dial tone.

16:09.428 --> 16:11.430
Oh, my God.
What if he's trying to steal something?

16:11.680 --> 16:12.931
You guys are a tech firm, right?

16:13.015 --> 16:15.475
It's not like you keep
any valuables around.

16:15.559 --> 16:17.853
That's not necessarily true.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.730
And he was coming from the vault room.

16:20.314 --> 16:22.107
There's no way
he could've gotten in there.

16:22.191 --> 16:24.276
All right, do you want to check?
I'll stay here, keep an eye out.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.236
Thank you. I mean, I'm sure it's nothing.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.404
No, go ahead. Make sure...

16:27.487 --> 16:29.114
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

16:38.540 --> 16:39.583
NEAL: Amy!

16:40.167 --> 16:41.960
The phones are working.
You want me to call security?

16:44.087 --> 16:46.423
No, it's fine.
Everything's where it should be.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.349
Oh. Hello, 1970s.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.562
Looks like I brought a lightsaber
to a knife fight.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.816
This is not good.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.285
-PETER: Are we done?
-Not yet. Mozzie's on it.

17:15.369 --> 17:17.788
-What's a Mozzie?
-He's Caffrey's soul mate.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.456
We needed a third man.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.083
I wasn't gonna recruit
one of the Panthers.

17:21.166 --> 17:23.210
Besides, there's no one better than Moz.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.003
No secrets. That was our deal.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.339
All right, look.
You're working with the FBI.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.049
Not the other way around.

17:30.676 --> 17:32.052
Van dwellers, there's a problem.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.846
Did you copy the file or not?

17:34.137 --> 17:36.139
-I did not.
-Wait. It wasn't there?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.432
Well, there's a problem.

17:37.516 --> 17:41.144
The problem is that
this can't be copied onto this.

17:41.937 --> 17:43.146
So, I took the original.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.357
The only way to access the Exodus file

17:46.233 --> 17:48.360
is to go back to the future.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.822
PETER: That should have
never left the vault.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.867
If someone discovers this missing,
this operation is a bust.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.618
We got it out, we'll get it back in,

17:56.910 --> 17:58.662
after extracting the Exodus file.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.788
Good luck with that.

17:59.872 --> 18:03.959
This is a first generation Minnow disk.
State-of-the-art in 1971.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.837
Yeah, the primordial ooze
of magnetic storage.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.505
Holds a whopping 80 kilobytes.

18:08.630 --> 18:11.717
Which, in modern standards, is like using
a mini-van to haul a family of fleas.

18:11.842 --> 18:13.760
These early disks
were never marketed commercially,

18:13.844 --> 18:16.763
so you'll be hard-pressed to find a drive
that can read it or talk to it.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.140
They're out there.

18:18.223 --> 18:21.101

18:21.185 --> 18:23.270
-Why?
-Cold War era tech.

18:23.353 --> 18:24.605
It's the new firewall.

and password-encoded networks...

and nuclear silos.

and use the girl to put it back.

18:38.452 --> 18:40.787
No. And we're not using Amy again.

18:57.804 --> 19:01.350
No, not really. I mean, that vault
is too secure to break back into.

stall her until you've printed out a copy.
You bring the disk over...

19:14.488 --> 19:17.032
You create a small diversion,
and I'll slip into her purse.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.367
And when she finds it?

19:18.450 --> 19:20.494
She puts it back where it belongs, right?

19:20.786 --> 19:22.371
To save herself.

DIANA: These right here,
airlines and corresponding plane numbers.

35:39.014 --> 35:40.307
PETER: International airlines.

35:40.390 --> 35:43.393
So, whatever they're transporting
is going in and out of the country.

35:43.477 --> 35:45.145
DIANA: We haven't figured out
what these numbers mean yet.

35:45.229 --> 35:47.648
But we think is has something to do
with where the shipment ends up.

35:47.731 --> 35:49.191
If everything is chosen at random...

35:49.274 --> 35:52.236
No one knows who's flying or where,
until the algorithm chooses.

35:52.319 --> 35:56.490
Built in this kind of secrecy,
it must be a very high-value target.

35:56.573 --> 35:59.159
Yeah. Without planning,
it's almost an impossible heist.

36:00.410 --> 36:01.787
Unless you have the algorithm.

36:01.870 --> 36:05.415
JONES: Yeah. Which, thanks to
Neal and Keller, the Pink Panthers do.

36:05.916 --> 36:07.292
Excellent work, you two.

36:09.920 --> 36:10.963
Luc.

36:20.514 --> 36:22.140
Have a seat.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.318
You stole evidence from my house.

36:33.902 --> 36:35.863
I called Interpol,
hoping I could rein you in.

36:36.029 --> 36:37.990
When I mentioned your name,

36:38.073 --> 36:40.367
they acted like
I was reporting an Elvis sighting.

36:40.701 --> 36:42.452
You're upset. I don't understand.

36:42.870 --> 36:46.123
Thanks to my CI,
Woodford has a copy of the Exodus file,

36:46.206 --> 36:48.458
and the Atlas Tech stayed quiet. Win-win.

36:48.542 --> 36:50.711
You're CI almost killed an innocent girl.

36:50.794 --> 36:53.547
My CI is the only reason
you and I aren't both mall cops right now.

36:54.089 --> 36:55.507
Does it matter anymore?

36:55.591 --> 36:57.801
I will not risk an innocent life.

36:57.885 --> 37:01.180
And I will do whatever is necessary
to bring down the Panthers.

37:01.513 --> 37:02.598
Not on my watch.

37:03.056 --> 37:04.725
Then when you're not watching.

37:06.727 --> 37:10.856
How about I arrest you right now
for interfering with an FBI investigation?

37:11.315 --> 37:13.483
Interpol said you didn't exist.

37:13.567 --> 37:16.737
We have places we can put you
where you don't.

37:23.410 --> 37:26.413
Hmm, a slap. Very Joan Crawford.

37:26.496 --> 37:29.958
I deserved it.
I never should have put Amy in harm's way.

37:30.042 --> 37:31.960
-Oh, you mean Keller's way.
-Even worse.

37:32.169 --> 37:34.505
There is no worse. Except maybe Luc.

37:34.588 --> 37:37.341
He has me seriously
reconsidering my Francophilia.

37:37.758 --> 37:40.344
Well, at least now we know
he's not afraid to get his hands dirty.

37:40.427 --> 37:44.473
Uh, he's a Frenchman who doesn't
drink wine. He's capable of anything.

37:46.850 --> 37:50.437
I never wanted to be this guy, Moz.
Someone who hurts innocent people.

37:53.565 --> 37:55.442
The con man's quandary.

37:56.109 --> 37:59.488
Maybe that's why I like working
for the FBI. We only con bad people.

38:00.822 --> 38:04.117
I still ascribe to W.C. Fields' mantra,

38:04.535 --> 38:07.329
"You can't cheat an honest man."

38:07.412 --> 38:08.705
Amy was the exception.

38:09.081 --> 38:10.082
She's a good person.

38:10.165 --> 38:13.544
Spent years trying to build a future,
and I stole that from her.

38:13.627 --> 38:15.587
Or you could look at it the other way.

38:15.963 --> 38:17.089
What other way?

38:17.214 --> 38:19.424
If you hadn't been there
to protect her from Keller,

38:19.508 --> 38:21.134
she wouldn't have had a future to steal.

38:24.471 --> 38:25.639
Honey!

38:27.099 --> 38:28.308
(GROANS)

38:31.144 --> 38:33.146
Hey! New in town, sailor?

38:33.230 --> 38:34.982
-You look hot.
-(CHUCKLES)

38:35.065 --> 38:37.276
-Mmm! Come here.
-Oh, no, no, no.

38:37.359 --> 38:40.237
That's gonna cost you
a very expensive dinner downtown.

38:40.445 --> 38:41.572
-On a Tuesday?
-Yes.

38:41.655 --> 38:43.240
We have six months to be spontaneous.

38:44.199 --> 38:45.242
-The baby.
-Yes.

38:45.367 --> 38:49.037
It's going to set our schedule.
So we have 8:00 reservations at Babbo.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.123
Let's be late.

38:51.874 --> 38:53.876
-Hey, hon.
-I'm being spontaneous.

38:55.586 --> 38:58.338
You're gonna be here for us, right?
Me and the baby.

38:59.089 --> 39:00.215
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

39:01.508 --> 39:03.635
I know you do important work.

39:03.719 --> 39:05.512
But being a father is important too.

39:07.014 --> 39:10.392
I've spent years dreaming of being a dad.

39:10.475 --> 39:13.187
And I don't wanna miss one second of it.

39:13.270 --> 39:16.565
I am gonna love watching you be a mom.

39:17.524 --> 39:19.818
We're gonna be great parents.

39:19.902 --> 39:22.112
Let's just not lose this.

39:22.696 --> 39:23.780
Us.

39:24.489 --> 39:27.993
What we had when I held up that sign
and we smiled at each other,

39:28.076 --> 39:29.203
across Houston Street.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.371
That is impossible.

39:34.917 --> 39:36.710
Let's be really late.

39:39.213 --> 39:41.590
-Ooh! Okay.
-(ELIZABETH GIGGLES)

39:55.270 --> 39:56.647
Chess, huh?

39:57.689 --> 39:59.983
Well, it's just like old times.

40:00.067 --> 40:03.612
Don't sit. It's more challenging
playing against myself.

40:06.073 --> 40:08.408
Is that right? Then why the call, Neal?

40:09.409 --> 40:10.452
Amy.

40:11.245 --> 40:14.081
Breaking into her apartment,
going for your knife.

40:14.748 --> 40:17.000
-It was a very fat line you crossed.
-Yeah?

40:17.417 --> 40:20.462
Well forgive me, Caffrey, for I have
sinned. What is... What's my penance?

40:21.088 --> 40:22.422
-You being you.
-(CHUCKLES)

40:23.423 --> 40:25.717
But if you try anything like that again,

40:26.301 --> 40:27.344
I throw my grenade.

40:28.345 --> 40:30.639
And I throw mine, and we're both dead.
So where's the sweet spot?

40:31.598 --> 40:33.225
I don't need one.

40:35.394 --> 40:37.896
Collateral damage
is a con man's by-product, Caffrey.

40:39.481 --> 40:41.149
See, guys like us,

40:41.984 --> 40:43.110
we hurt people around us.

40:43.986 --> 40:45.612
I'm not a guy like you.

40:46.280 --> 40:49.199
You keep telling yourself that,
sweetheart.

40:50.117 --> 40:52.744
So what? You got it all figured out, huh?

40:53.203 --> 40:54.872
We take down the Panthers,
we get our freedom.

40:54.955 --> 40:57.082
Then what? Live happily ever after?

40:57.165 --> 40:59.501
-Yeah. Something like that.
-Something like that?

41:00.627 --> 41:03.672
Yeah, you're living
in a fairytale, Caffrey.

41:04.506 --> 41:07.134
No matter what happens, me and you,

41:07.217 --> 41:08.218
we're hunted men.

41:09.636 --> 41:11.513
We take down Woodford and his crew,

41:12.472 --> 41:14.057
it's never over.

41:14.683 --> 41:16.560
Even in prison,
they'll come looking for us.

41:16.643 --> 41:20.105
And their reach, my friend,
it is far and it is wide.

41:21.315 --> 41:24.818
And the Panthers, Neal, they don't stop
looking for rats until they're dead.

41:25.444 --> 41:27.446
Until then, guess who they go after.

41:28.155 --> 41:30.032
People closest to you.

41:31.450 --> 41:33.118
And they'd make it hurt, Caffrey.

41:33.202 --> 41:37.206
They'd make it hurt so bad
that you'd wish that they'd found you.

41:41.293 --> 41:45.172
So, you enjoy this freedom
you're working so hard to get.

41:45.255 --> 41:47.674
'Cause when
you're footloose and fancy-free,

41:48.050 --> 41:50.093
those people that you love so much,

41:50.677 --> 41:51.887
are on death row.
