WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.136
MAN: The US government

00:02.170 --> 00:04.872
is planning to attack
the Soviet Union.

00:04.905 --> 00:07.541
MAN #2: We have to prevent
innocent people
from getting hurt.

00:07.575 --> 00:10.544
ANNOUNCER: The Americans,
all new Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.382
ANNOUNCER: FX presents

00:14.415 --> 00:16.584
Feud: Bette and Joan.

00:19.353 --> 00:24.692
Jane, I'm only trying to explain
the way things are.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.195
And if it weren't...
If... Now, if I weren't

00:27.228 --> 00:28.662
in this chair...
Oh, Miss Crawford,
I'm so excited!

00:28.696 --> 00:31.432
I'm going to be playing
your neighbor right next door.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.234
So close.
(chuckles)

00:33.267 --> 00:34.502
Can I please have
your autograph?

00:34.535 --> 00:35.836
It's for my grandmother.

00:35.869 --> 00:36.970
She's loved you
since she was a kid.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.156
Thanks.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.030
(chuckling)

01:03.063 --> 01:04.332
(men chuckling)

01:11.439 --> 01:14.575
Sometimes you need to
hit it square in the jaw.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.479
(bottle falls)

01:18.512 --> 01:20.881
(chuckles)

01:20.914 --> 01:22.950
You know, Bob,
I was thinking.

01:24.185 --> 01:28.088
We need to pack the bags
of the girl next door.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.590
She's moving out.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.325
Wh... Oh, Joan,
I-I don't have time to recast.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.460
We're shooting tomorrow.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.094
I have co-star approval.

01:34.128 --> 01:34.995
She's not a co-star.

01:35.028 --> 01:37.665
That's right.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.501
And she never will be.

01:43.971 --> 01:44.938
(knocking at door)

01:44.972 --> 01:47.308
What?
(door opens)

01:47.341 --> 01:49.277
You wanted to see me?

01:49.310 --> 01:51.612
Yeah. Forget the little
daily gifts, Lucille.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.347
I'm going to be
much too busy working

01:53.381 --> 01:55.649
to shop for anything
in return.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.786
Whatever you say.
Only let's not fight.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.322
We have to support each other,
Bette.

02:01.355 --> 02:04.525
I'm worried our director
isn't taking care of us,

02:04.558 --> 02:06.294
so we have to take
care of each other.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.695
What the hell does that mean?

02:07.728 --> 02:09.830
You're the one that hired
the goddamn director.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.799
I'm going to be blunt, Bette.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.834
Aldrich is a lady-killer.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.836
He likes young blondes.

02:15.869 --> 02:19.473
The cookie
that's playing the neighbor.

02:19.507 --> 02:22.210
I saw her. She's no threat.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.777
Well, not now, of course.

02:23.811 --> 02:27.481
But what happens when he starts
sleeping with her?

02:27.515 --> 02:31.118
Suddenly she has more lines
and scenes than you do.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.987
Now, I've asked him to replace
her with someone less showy,

02:34.021 --> 02:36.290
less likely to pull focus,

02:36.324 --> 02:38.326
but he refused.

02:39.760 --> 02:44.131
'Course, you have more scenes
with her than I do, so...

02:44.164 --> 02:47.000
perhaps I'm being out of line.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.503
You know, Bette,

02:49.537 --> 02:52.973
I just wanted to say...

02:53.006 --> 02:55.976
I think what you're doing
with this part

02:56.009 --> 02:59.413
is incredibly brave.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.523
(door closes)

03:24.405 --> 03:25.839
Bette?

03:25.873 --> 03:27.341
Bette, where are you going?

03:27.375 --> 03:28.276
Your big scene's up next.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.411
I'm going home sick, Bob.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.579
You don't look sick.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.681
I am. I'm sick to my stomach
because of you.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.583
I thought you wanted to
work with Crawford and me

03:35.616 --> 03:37.251
because you respected us.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.287
Because you wanted our opinions.
But clearly, you don't.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.522
And that just makes me
want to vomit.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.425
What are you talking about?
Crawford wants that woman that's
playing the neighbor gone,

03:44.458 --> 03:45.593
and I have to agree.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.395
You're casting with
the wrong head, Bob.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.896
She's not an actress,

03:48.929 --> 03:50.364
she's not going to
elevate the material.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.565
I mean, look at her.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.966
Her audition was wonderful.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.234
I want her gone.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.202
I won't do it.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.337
Then I'm going home sick.

04:02.009 --> 04:05.746
I forgot my purse.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.752
Goddamn it!

04:36.444 --> 04:39.179
*

05:08.842 --> 05:11.845
*

05:39.573 --> 05:42.342
(seagulls chirping,
waves crashing)

05:55.623 --> 05:58.526
I think I'm all right.
Is that a mirror? Thank you.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.260
You're in my light, honey.
Oh.

06:00.293 --> 06:02.563
Did you see that...
What was it? Coming Home?
Mm-hmm, yeah.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.098
Some kind of Vietnam
War thing. Oh, God.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.334
MAN: Talk to me about
the origins of the feud.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.869
BLONDELL:
Hell, those two?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.938
They didn't actually need
a reason to hate each other.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.940
It was chemical.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.576
But things didn't start
to boil over until the '40s,

06:15.609 --> 06:17.578
when they were in their 40s.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.547
Bette's star was rising
at Warner's,

06:19.580 --> 06:22.115
and over at MGM,
Joan's was starting to dim.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.383
Cut!

06:23.417 --> 06:25.686
I'm sorry.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.689
Can someone
ask an executive

06:28.722 --> 06:30.458
to come down
to the stage, please?

06:30.491 --> 06:32.426
I'm so confused.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.962
We... We're on our honeymoon.

06:34.995 --> 06:39.467
We're recruited
by the British Secret Service

06:39.500 --> 06:43.036
to stop the Nazis. Right?

06:43.070 --> 06:46.707
Does this make sense
to anyone?

06:46.740 --> 06:49.810
Can someone
explain it to me?

06:49.843 --> 06:53.413
BLONDELL: Now that Garbo and
Shearer had packed it in,

06:53.447 --> 06:54.482
Joan wanted roles with dignity.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.617
She'd had it up to here

06:56.650 --> 06:58.285
with the slatterns
and shopgirl roles

06:58.318 --> 06:59.953
that had made her a star.

06:59.987 --> 07:03.056
She fought tooth and nail
for the role of Marie Curie.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.458
JOAN:
Listen, Louis.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.627
Either I play
that egghead dame,

07:06.660 --> 07:08.662
or I walk.

07:16.704 --> 07:19.940
Then I suggest
you start walking.

07:24.678 --> 07:30.050
* Somebody else
is taking my place *

07:31.885 --> 07:34.788
BLONDELL: Two weeks later,
Joan signed with Warner's.

07:34.822 --> 07:39.259
* Now shares your embrace *

07:39.292 --> 07:41.428
Thank you, Daddy.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.530
Oh, come on, Joan.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.131
Let's cut the "Daddy" shit,
all right?

07:44.164 --> 07:47.034
Might have worked
for that fat fuck over at MGM,

07:47.067 --> 07:48.268
but you're working
for me now.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.303
(chuckles)
Tchin tchin.

07:50.337 --> 07:53.974
BLONDELL: Warner picked up
the former MGM glamour girl

07:54.007 --> 07:57.444
at closeout, everything must go
bargain-basement rates.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.013
And he still thought
he was paying too much.

08:02.349 --> 08:06.253
* Little you care
for vows that you made *

08:09.523 --> 08:11.725
Cancel my appointments
for the rest of the afternoon.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.296
BLONDELL: Warner brought
Crawford in for one reason:

08:16.329 --> 08:21.068
to use as a cudgel against
his problem child, Bette Davis.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.203
Bette was the undisputed

08:23.236 --> 08:25.338
queen of the lot...
(gasps)

08:25.372 --> 08:27.040
...playing one Oscar-nominated
role after another.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.308
Addie.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.177
She was difficult. Expensive.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.746
Addie, quick.
And far too powerful,

08:32.780 --> 08:34.582
especially for a woman.

08:34.615 --> 08:38.385
Joan was Jack's message
to Bette:

08:38.418 --> 08:41.054
You're not the only bitch
in the kennel.

08:41.088 --> 08:44.291
And Joan wasn't too proud
to take Bette's scraps.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.729
VEDA: You've never spoken
of your people.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.197
Who you came from.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.531
Maybe that's
why Father...

08:51.565 --> 08:52.733
BLONDELL:
Wasn't long

08:52.766 --> 08:54.501
before she found
her comeback role.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.738
A role that Bette
never would have passed on

08:57.771 --> 09:01.875
had she realized
it was Oscar-worthy material.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.611
(telephone rings)

09:03.644 --> 09:05.112
What?

09:05.145 --> 09:06.880
MAN:
Sir, Bette Davis is here.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.049
She's demanding to see you.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.218
Shit.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.586
BETTE: I know
what you're doing, Jack,

09:12.620 --> 09:15.956
giving Crawford
all my roles to control me,

09:15.989 --> 09:17.725
make me insecure.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.960
You said you were offended
that I offered it to you.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.462
I didn't want to play
the mother of a teenager.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.231
All right, well, then,
there's a lesson in all this,

09:24.264 --> 09:25.699
isn't there, chickie?

09:25.733 --> 09:28.235
Next time, you got to
fucking trust big daddy.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.870
But aren't you even
just a little excited

09:29.903 --> 09:31.739
about that pip of a
script I sent you?

09:31.772 --> 09:34.608
Where I play a neglected wife
in a black fright wig

09:34.642 --> 09:37.144
who tries to abort her child
by throwing herself down a hill

09:37.177 --> 09:38.445
and then dies?

09:38.478 --> 09:40.113
Fine. Don't do it.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.649
Crawford loves it.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.751
If you'll excuse me,

09:43.784 --> 09:46.286
I'm late for my lunch now.
Let me guess, Lana Turner?

09:46.319 --> 09:47.487
Nope.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.089
Judy Garland?
Nope.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.158
Ava Gardner?

09:51.191 --> 09:53.827
Joan Crawford.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.963
BLONDELL:
Poor Bette.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.597
While Joan
now got the best parts

09:57.631 --> 10:00.133
for women of a certain age,
it was Bette

10:00.167 --> 10:03.536
who had to play the shopgirls
and the slatterns.

10:05.172 --> 10:08.676
(sighs) What a dump.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.011
BLONDELL: And it was Jack Warner
who, through it all,

10:11.044 --> 10:13.647
made millions off both of 'em.

10:13.681 --> 10:16.316
And probably always would.

10:24.357 --> 10:27.695
Ain't that just the way?

10:35.535 --> 10:36.804
Oh, there's my star.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.638
I hate the breakfast scene.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.008
I love that scene.
Too much exposition.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.642
No, she's rubbing
Blanche's nose in it.

10:42.676 --> 10:45.012
She stole her limelight.
You got to use that underneath.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.347
I don't need subtext,
Bob, I need good text.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.549
Bette, it's today's work,
it's a good scene,

10:49.582 --> 10:50.650
and Joan likes it.

10:50.684 --> 10:51.952
JOAN:
I never said that.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.321
I agree with Bette.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.056
The writing doesn't
begin to capture

10:56.089 --> 10:57.858
how women get under
each other's skin.

10:57.891 --> 11:01.528
The intent is there,

11:01.561 --> 11:03.897
but the execution
is lackluster.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.665
You work on that, Bob.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.467
See what you can do.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.203
We'll anxiously be
awaiting a rewrite.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.972
How do you like that--
"anxiously" awaiting?

11:12.005 --> 11:13.640
(both chuckling)

11:13.673 --> 11:16.877
Isn't that a
pretty picture?

11:16.910 --> 11:18.378
They're finally
getting along.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.847
Yeah, and to think
only last week

11:19.880 --> 11:21.815
they were wishing
each other dead.

11:21.849 --> 11:25.986
(laughing)

11:26.019 --> 11:28.722
(indistinct chatter)

11:31.091 --> 11:32.893
JOAN:
Bette is just amazing.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.695
Oh, she's going to win
all the awards this year.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.731
(chuckles)
Hedda.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.367
Are you two gals really
getting along together?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.402
Come on, you can tell Hedda.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.271
Hedda, we told you before,

11:44.304 --> 11:46.206
we're getting on
like a house on fire.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.509
I haven't seen this much shit
since my last bowel movement.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.511
What year was that?

11:51.544 --> 11:54.181
1932.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.383
You know the good thing
about scotch, Bob,

11:56.416 --> 11:58.952
is it only gets better
when it ages.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.120
Broads...

12:00.153 --> 12:01.922
they just get sour.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.195
So I hear that
these two bitches are

12:08.228 --> 12:10.030
really busting
your balls, huh, Bobby?

12:10.063 --> 12:11.631
Aw, typical stuff,
you know.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.566
Bette's always fighting me
for another close-up,

12:13.600 --> 12:15.735
Joan's always fighting
me to take it out.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.604
But they're burning up
the screen, Jack.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.239
You should have
paired them years ago.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.240
(chuckling):
No, thanks.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.875
Two world wars were enough.

12:21.909 --> 12:25.712
But there's something I want
to talk to you about, Bobby.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.915
The front office tells me
that you're behind schedule,

12:27.948 --> 12:29.883
and I don't like that.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.885
Well, j-just by one day.
We just started.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.921
I'll make it up.
Okay.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.455
And also, I'm not gonna
release the picture

12:35.488 --> 12:37.891
the way I said I would.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.060
I'm gonna open it bigger.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.996
The way no one's ever
done before.

12:43.030 --> 12:46.934
A wide release.
400 screens.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.269
Ha ha!
(both laughing)

12:49.302 --> 12:50.737
Did I get you?
I got you!

12:50.770 --> 12:52.339
Oh, you got me.
I got you.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.842
400? Are you crazy?
What-- why?

12:54.875 --> 12:57.010
Why? 'Cause you're right.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.578
They're burning up
the screen together.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.415
Bobby, their scenes
are fucking electric.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.784
They are fucking electric!

13:04.818 --> 13:07.154
And let's face it,
after Psycho,

13:07.187 --> 13:09.689
horror's the future,
and we got it.

13:09.722 --> 13:13.493
Okay, now here's what
we got to do.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.095
There's got to be buzz.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.964
Yeah, yeah, we can keep
the publicity machine going.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.798
I'll give your PR people
full access to the set.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.634
No, no, no, there's got to
be more than that, bubbie.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.770
You got to keep 'em
at each other's throats.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.805
You have to.

13:25.839 --> 13:26.806
I'll make sure their names
are in the papers.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.508
That's not a problem.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.844
But if you do this,
you'll be able to

13:30.878 --> 13:32.545
write your own ticket
in this town.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.682
L'chaim, bubbeleh.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.517
Well done, Bobby.
Come on!

13:37.550 --> 13:39.486
Let's go see
what they're doing.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.291
It's not just about morale,

13:44.324 --> 13:46.960
it's also about respect--
I've lost both.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.295
Ever since I fired
that tomato

13:48.328 --> 13:50.030
who was playing
the neighbor girl,

13:50.063 --> 13:52.232
the whole crew knows that
I was pushed into it.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.167
The whole crew knows
Crawford and Davis

13:54.201 --> 13:56.403
are running the show--
they double-teamed me.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.306
I'm telling you, Harriet,
Jack Palance and Lee Marvin

13:59.339 --> 14:00.874
would have never
pulled this shit.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.877
Yeah, they don't have to.
They're men.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.312
Yeah, well, that makes
them half as cunning

14:05.345 --> 14:07.414
and nowhere near as ruthless.

14:07.447 --> 14:08.715
I'd think you'd be happy

14:08.748 --> 14:10.217
that both your stars
are getting along.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.019
Yeah, they're not
getting along.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.486
They're just teaming up.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.188
It's like
the Hitler/Stalin pact.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.424
You know, maybe Warner's
got the right idea.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.527
He wants to leak some dirt
to the gossip columns, you know,

14:20.560 --> 14:21.528
get a little catfight going.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.530
Bob, that's terrible.

14:23.563 --> 14:27.000
Well, it could get a lot of
pre-release publicity that way.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.269
Anyway, pitting them
against each other

14:29.302 --> 14:30.737
might be just the way
to control them.

14:30.770 --> 14:33.373
Bob, don't you dare.
It's too cruel.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.675
They need to feel
secure and supported.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.078
But not by each other.
I can support 'em both.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.014
Well, don't fool yourself.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.483
Even you're not man enough
to satisfy two women.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.290
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

14:50.323 --> 14:54.794
Why don't you ask your
little strudel, Gretchen?

14:57.897 --> 15:00.733
Harriet, where are you
getting this from?

15:00.767 --> 15:04.137
Gossip on a set
is poison, Bob,

15:04.171 --> 15:05.905
and spreads fast.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.240
It's a small town,

15:07.274 --> 15:09.876
and everybody finds
out everything.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.644
Even your wife.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.780
Well, it's bullshit.

15:15.848 --> 15:20.553
Maybe, but it hurts
just the same.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.989
And you should consider that

15:22.022 --> 15:24.791
before you start
spreading gossip of your own.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.705
*

15:41.941 --> 15:43.676
HEDDA:
Hi, Bill.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.516
Oh, Roger, hi.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.619
Nancy, you look beautiful.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.588
Barbara, how are you?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.857
Hello, Bob.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.326
And let me just say again

15:59.359 --> 16:00.994
what a thrill it is
for me to be directing

16:01.028 --> 16:02.695
these two legends
of the screen.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.764
Mm. Really, Bob?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.966
That's it?
That's it.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.136
I'll leave it up to you
to spruce up the adjectives.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.804
Oh, I think you've
got me confused

16:11.838 --> 16:14.107
with Adela Rogers St. Johns.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.943
I came here for
red meat, not pabulum.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.279
No one wants to read about
how those two battle-axes

16:19.312 --> 16:21.148
make nice with each other.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.515
Well, what can I
tell you, Hedda?

16:22.549 --> 16:23.883
They're both consummate
professionals.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.353
You know who you
remind me of?

16:26.386 --> 16:28.388
Not John Ford.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.157
Now, there's a man
who commands

16:30.190 --> 16:31.724
not only a movie set,

16:31.758 --> 16:32.859
but his own press.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.827
He knows how
to play the game.

16:34.861 --> 16:36.463
Which is why he's
as vital now

16:36.496 --> 16:37.697
as he was before talkies.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.700
Where are you, Bob?
Three bombs.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.236
You want to go back
to directing television?

16:43.270 --> 16:45.905
This picture could
make you relevant again.

16:45.938 --> 16:49.576
I have too much dignity to get
into the gutter with you, Hedda.

16:49.609 --> 16:53.913
Well, I hope dignity

16:53.946 --> 16:55.715
pays your gas bill.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.885
All right, wait, wait.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.656
I might have something,
but you didn't hear it from me.

17:03.690 --> 17:07.094
Blind item, my specialty.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.328
Well, it...

17:08.361 --> 17:13.333
This is about...
Crawford's tits.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.934
Oh, I'm all ears.
Well, that's just it.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.404
Crawford's all tits.

17:17.437 --> 17:21.040
Davis has been complaining
that they're too perky.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.076
Perky?

17:23.110 --> 17:24.244
Fake.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.846
She wears falsies?
Yeah.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.014
(chuckling)

17:28.047 --> 17:31.584
You know, Davis is
a real artist.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.753
She says she can't
play to them.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.755
And she says she's scared
of falling onto them

17:35.788 --> 17:38.425
in the beach scene because
she thinks she'll chip a tooth.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.060
Ha!
Says those things
are hard as rocks.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.563
Oh, that's great.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.134
Yeah.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.035
"Chip a tooth."

17:49.068 --> 17:50.637
Yeah, that's great.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.089
(engine revving,
tires screech)

18:20.300 --> 18:22.269
Miss Crawford...

18:22.302 --> 18:24.070
Miss Crawford,
do you have any response

18:24.103 --> 18:26.439
to the comments made by
Miss Davis in Hopper's column?

18:26.473 --> 18:27.974
Oh, I certainly do,

18:28.007 --> 18:29.842
but nothing I'd let
my children read

18:29.876 --> 18:31.678
in a family newspaper.

18:36.883 --> 18:41.654
(service buzzer buzzing)

18:41.688 --> 18:44.457
All right, Blanche Hudson,

18:44.491 --> 18:47.927
Miss Big Fat Movie Star!

18:47.960 --> 18:50.297
Miss Rotten Stinking Actress!

18:50.330 --> 18:52.432
Bob, I have to talk to you.
What?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.967
Cut!
I'm in the middle
of a fucking take!

18:55.001 --> 18:56.002
What is it?
Have you seen

18:56.035 --> 18:57.704
Hedda's column this morning?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.138
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Okay, take a break,
everybody.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.208
No, I haven't.
Why, does she mention us?

19:01.241 --> 19:02.775
Us? Oh, no, no.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.678
Not us. Me? Yes.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.647
Would you like me
to read it to you?

19:07.680 --> 19:09.349
"The woman is crazy.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.319
"I always suspected
she had a false front,

19:12.352 --> 19:14.821
"and now I know for sure.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.624
And they're 34 double Ds."
(laughing)

19:17.657 --> 19:19.792
Are you going to let her
get away with this?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.728
Get away with what?
I said no such thing.

19:21.761 --> 19:22.862
Joan, I'm sure
Bette's comments

19:22.895 --> 19:24.664
were taken out of context.

19:24.697 --> 19:25.865
Who gives a shit, Lucille?

19:25.898 --> 19:27.133
Everybody knows
you pad your bra.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.802
You've been doing
it for years.

19:29.836 --> 19:34.307
Bob, will you please
tell Miss Davis

19:34.341 --> 19:36.376
that I will sue her

19:36.409 --> 19:38.411
if she continues
to make comments

19:38.445 --> 19:40.680
that are injurious

19:40.713 --> 19:42.682
to my ability to earn a living.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.517
Ha! Earn a living?

19:44.551 --> 19:47.153
Every time you belch,
Pepsi gives you ten grand.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.556
How dare you mention Pepsi!

19:49.589 --> 19:51.991
Unlike you,
it's good and pure.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.328
It's pure, all right.
Pure vodka!

19:55.362 --> 19:56.529
Betty, Joan,
come on, ladies, please.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.964
Let's just...

20:01.434 --> 20:03.002
JOAN:
She's jealous of me.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.706
She has always been
so jealous of me.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.841
Joanie, who wouldn't be?
Look at you.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.610
ROBERT:
You're beautiful, talented.

20:10.643 --> 20:11.944
You're a legend.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.281
And I understand
that you're upset.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.349
But put all that passion,
all that anger

20:16.383 --> 20:17.617
into your performance.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.219
Forget about her.
Forget her.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.788
Listen to me.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.457
I am the only opinion
that matters.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.459
(exhales)

20:28.895 --> 20:30.330
Oh!

20:32.765 --> 20:36.202
I'll make you proud of me,

20:36.235 --> 20:37.837
I promise.

21:00.293 --> 21:03.062
OLIVIA: Years later,
when I heard what was going on,

21:03.095 --> 21:04.731
I was furious.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.499
I mean, at the time,
we didn't know

21:06.533 --> 21:11.103
that these two great screen
legends, friends of ours,

21:11.137 --> 21:14.774
were being manipulated so
cruelly by the men around them.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.176
Well, not that we could've
done anything about it.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.412
You know how much power
women had back then?

21:19.446 --> 21:22.315
Exactly as much
as we got now: zippo.

21:22.349 --> 21:23.983
Well, you have to remember,

21:24.016 --> 21:26.653
this was before the modern
women's lib movement.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.821
Which I admire very
much, by the way.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.256
Me, too.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.492
But imagine a studio today

21:32.525 --> 21:35.928
tried to pit Miss Jane Fonda
against Miss Dyan Cannon.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.030
I mean, the girls would revolt.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.699
Oh, horseshit.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.300
Nothing's changed.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.436
No matter how liberated,
women'll do

21:43.470 --> 21:45.472
what they always do
when they're cornered:

21:45.505 --> 21:49.709
eat their own and pick
their teeth with the bones.

21:58.217 --> 21:59.852
(telephone ringing)

22:01.854 --> 22:03.222
Louella, darling.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.191
Joan here.

22:05.224 --> 22:09.562
Listen, I'm calling about
the article Hedda wrote today.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.398
I have a rebuttal.

22:11.431 --> 22:15.201
No, but for you.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.637
Are you writing it down?

22:17.670 --> 22:19.972
Good.

22:20.006 --> 22:23.576
Miss Davis looks old enough
to be my mother.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.978
One look at her face
and you'd think

22:26.012 --> 22:31.017
she hasn't had a happy day,
or night, in her life.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.422
Yes, you can quote me.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.557
I'm counting on it.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.093
(tires screeching)

22:42.562 --> 22:44.531
SYLVIA: Miss Davis, care
to comment on the fact

22:44.564 --> 22:46.833
that Miss Crawford says you look
old enough to be her mother?

22:46.866 --> 22:48.034
What's your name, sweetheart?

22:48.067 --> 22:49.235
Sylvia.

22:49.268 --> 22:51.370
Fuck off, Sylvia.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.740
Oh! Come on.

22:55.608 --> 22:59.412
Go to my room
and read a goddamn book.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.753
(knocking on door)

23:06.786 --> 23:09.088
Come in.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.624
Let's have a little talk.

23:11.658 --> 23:13.125
I'd love that.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.427
Although I know you
prefer chewing the fat

23:14.461 --> 23:16.195
with gossip columnists.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.797
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.131
Louella Parsons, today.

23:19.165 --> 23:21.233
You're quoted on the
record, Lucille.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.069
Oh, yes. That.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.472
Let me just cut through
the movie star bullshit

23:25.505 --> 23:29.609
you cling to when the waters get
too deep for you to stay afloat,

23:29.642 --> 23:30.710
and explain
something to you.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.912
I can't wait to hear.

23:32.945 --> 23:35.047
You seem to have forgotten
that the unflattering makeup

23:35.081 --> 23:37.617
I'm wearing in this picture
is a choice

23:37.650 --> 23:39.919
designed to create a character.
I'm not interested

23:39.952 --> 23:41.588
in vanity,
I'm not interested in gossip.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.089
I'm interested in the work.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.992
That's what I want to do,
so I suggest you stop

23:46.025 --> 23:48.928
fitting in calls to Parsons
between your morning coffee

23:48.961 --> 23:50.963
and taking a shit
of butterflies and moonbeams

23:50.997 --> 23:53.500
and whatever else comes
flying out of your ass.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.769
If you don't, it's your funeral.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.674
Are you threatening me?

24:01.708 --> 24:03.843
You'll kill me?

24:03.876 --> 24:05.411
Worse. I'm gonna steal
this picture right out

24:05.444 --> 24:08.347
from under your nose
and you know I can do it.

24:08.380 --> 24:09.749
I am doing it.

24:09.782 --> 24:10.650
Says who?

24:10.683 --> 24:11.851
The crew, the director.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.119
Everybody.

24:14.353 --> 24:19.058
Mr. Aldrich says
he loves my performance.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.828
Interesting.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.463
(door opens)

24:24.497 --> 24:26.766
(door closes)

24:26.799 --> 24:30.336
JOAN: After all those years,
I'm still in this chair.

24:30.369 --> 24:33.706
Doesn't that give you
some kind of responsibility?

24:33.740 --> 24:37.176
Jane, I'm just trying to
explain how things really are.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.178
This is fantastic footage, Bob.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.113
It's fantastic.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.982
I-I mean, you can
literally feel the hate

24:43.015 --> 24:44.817
steaming off the screen.
It's... It...

24:44.851 --> 24:47.053
Are you sure it's not the acting
you're responding to?

24:47.086 --> 24:48.688
Uh, Hank, turn the sound down.

24:48.721 --> 24:51.223
What, are you kidding me?
There's so much ham up there

24:51.257 --> 24:54.126
I'm gonna have to go to my rabbi
this afternoon and atone.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.461
No! I'm talking about
what's underneath

24:55.494 --> 24:56.563
all that scene chewing.

24:56.596 --> 24:59.298
Pure, naked rancor.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.967
I love it. I want more.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.434
More?
Yeah.

25:03.369 --> 25:05.404
Come here, come here.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.540
You've got to make
each one think

25:07.574 --> 25:10.076
that you like
the other one more.
Oh, Jesus, Jack.

25:10.109 --> 25:13.179
The atmosphere on set's
frosty enough as it is.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.547
You sure you want me
to stir that pot?

25:15.748 --> 25:17.584
What are you,
red all of a sudden?

25:17.617 --> 25:20.352
You got something
against capitalism? Huh?

25:20.386 --> 25:22.521
(laughs) Look, Bob,
come here, look.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.924
What we're looking
at right there

25:24.957 --> 25:27.860
is a raw display
of the free market.

25:27.894 --> 25:28.895
That's vigorous competition.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.262
That's the American way.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.365
The more that they
despise each other,

25:33.399 --> 25:35.868
the more that each
one tries to crush

25:35.902 --> 25:37.937
the other one,

25:37.970 --> 25:39.171
the better they get!

25:39.205 --> 25:40.740
But they're already good.

25:40.773 --> 25:45.044
No, they're great. Great, but
they can be greater still.

25:45.077 --> 25:48.380
Do you think that Wellington
was such a hot general?

25:48.414 --> 25:50.617
He wasn't. He was a piker,

25:50.650 --> 25:52.551
until he had to go
up against Napoleon.

25:52.585 --> 25:54.220
And why?

25:54.253 --> 25:56.756
Because he hated
Napoleon's guts.

25:56.789 --> 25:59.025
He hated him.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.628
It was his hatred
that made him great.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.095
Jack, that was war.

26:03.129 --> 26:05.431
So is this.

26:05.464 --> 26:07.133
Turn it up!

26:07.166 --> 26:08.901
JOAN: You wouldn't do
all these awful things to me

26:08.935 --> 26:12.438
if I weren't
still in this chair.

26:12.471 --> 26:14.373
Ha! Look at that,
look at that!

26:14.406 --> 26:15.708
But you are, Blanche.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.877
You are in that chair.
(Jack laughs)

26:17.910 --> 26:19.779
ROBERT: Cut.
Fantastic.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.213
Fantastic, Bob.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.616
(Jack continues laughing)

26:32.792 --> 26:34.927
Bob, sorry I'm late.
Two hours late, Bette.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.396
You asked me to be here at noon
and on a Saturday.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.265
It's unforgivable, I know.
I overslept.

26:39.298 --> 26:42.969
I... I was in a panic
last night, I had a drink.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.236
I...

26:44.270 --> 26:45.471
(sighs)

26:50.142 --> 26:52.144
This week
has been murder for me.

26:52.178 --> 26:53.780
Yeah, it's been tough
on everybody.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.782
(sighs)
I have no idea

26:55.815 --> 26:58.150
if what I'm doing
is working at all.

26:58.184 --> 26:59.986
Is it a brave choice,

27:00.019 --> 27:01.954
or is it just
in reaction to her?

27:01.988 --> 27:04.090
She infuriates me,

27:04.123 --> 27:06.826
I just want to smother her
with my performance.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.294
And Jane wants to smother
Blanche. It's perfect.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.662
Is it?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.864
I don't want to end up
a joke, Bob.

27:11.898 --> 27:13.465
I feel I need
to get control,

27:13.499 --> 27:14.834
and I don't know
if I can do that

27:14.867 --> 27:17.503
when I'm seeing red
all the time.

27:17.536 --> 27:19.171
Maybe I should invite her
to dinner.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.439
No. No.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.041
No, no, no.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.043
You know, there's such a thing
as alchemy, Bette.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.778
You don't mess with alchemy.

27:25.812 --> 27:29.315
My advice, you just keep doing
what you're doing.

27:29.348 --> 27:32.384
Muscle out the
next few weeks.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.120
Stay in your own lane,

27:34.153 --> 27:37.056
because that road is gonna
get you to your next Oscar.

27:38.925 --> 27:41.393
Trust me.

27:43.696 --> 27:47.199
I do trust you.

27:50.937 --> 27:54.340
You won't let me look
ridiculous.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.608
Of course not.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.948
All right, let's look
at the scene.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.084
"I've Written
a Letter to Daddy,"

28:05.117 --> 28:06.552
frankly, scares
the shit out of me.

28:06.585 --> 28:08.354
I'm not a singer, never was.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.857
Oh, come on, Bette,
you sang with the U.S.O.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.425
That's why I want you to perform
the number live, on the set.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.896
You just said you wouldn't
let me look ridiculous.

28:16.929 --> 28:20.332
And I won't, but it's all about
the pathos, Bette. The loss.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.101
Jane just wants
to be that adored

28:22.134 --> 28:24.203
eight-year-old girl again.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.905
It's her selling the number,
not you.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.539
Come on.

28:27.573 --> 28:30.276
Why don't we give
it a whirl, huh?

28:30.309 --> 28:31.543
Come on.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.649
(Bette clears throat)

28:39.218 --> 28:42.554
* I've written
a letter to Daddy. *

28:42.588 --> 28:44.690
No, you don't need that.
You know the words.
Ugh...

28:44.723 --> 28:46.092
You need your hands,

28:46.125 --> 28:47.526
Jane is open.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.228
Big, theatrical gestures.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.930
Remember, she's vaudeville.

28:50.963 --> 28:53.499
* I've... *

28:57.169 --> 29:01.874
* I've written
a letter to Daddy *

29:01.908 --> 29:04.110
BOTH:
* His address *

29:04.143 --> 29:07.546
* Is heaven above *

29:07.579 --> 29:12.051
* I've written
"Dear Daddy, we miss you" *

29:12.084 --> 29:16.055
* And wish you were here
with us to love *

29:16.088 --> 29:19.625
* Instead of a stamp
I put kisses *

29:19.658 --> 29:20.993
(both laugh)

29:21.027 --> 29:25.331
* The postman says
that's best to do *

29:25.364 --> 29:29.168
* I'm writing
a letter to Daddy *

29:29.201 --> 29:30.970
* Saying *

29:31.003 --> 29:36.442
* "I love you." *

29:41.113 --> 29:42.581
You got plans for dinner?

29:42.614 --> 29:44.150
I feel like I owe you something

29:44.183 --> 29:46.853
for having you cool your heels
all morning.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.821
I promised Harriet
I'd take her to Perino's.

29:48.855 --> 29:49.788
Bring her.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.858
(chuckles softly)

29:58.030 --> 30:00.166
JOAN: I want you
to take all the costumes

30:00.199 --> 30:02.268
and just lay them out
in the dressing room

30:02.301 --> 30:04.670
and that way, I can go through
them and determine which...

30:04.703 --> 30:06.738
...I said, okay, how about...

30:08.975 --> 30:11.377
(laughs)

30:11.410 --> 30:13.412
(chuckles)

30:18.684 --> 30:22.054
The crew is abuzz.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.056
About my performance?

30:24.090 --> 30:25.992
About their relationship.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.960
Apparently,
they've been working

30:27.994 --> 30:31.530
on her scenes
all weekend long.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.174
So, you like the tie?

30:42.208 --> 30:43.209
Mm. I do.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.244
(telephone ringing)

30:54.086 --> 30:56.088
Hello?

31:01.793 --> 31:03.395
Hmm?

31:03.429 --> 31:05.531
It's Joan Crawford.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.903
Joan?

31:10.937 --> 31:12.438
It's fucking midnight.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.839
(crying):
Bob, he left me.

31:13.872 --> 31:14.840
Who?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.508
Peter.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.277
Oh, we had a terrible row.

31:18.310 --> 31:21.113
He said this picture meant more
to me than he did and he left.

31:21.147 --> 31:22.181
He was drunk.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.383
Oh, God.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.518
I have to quit the picture, Bob.
I can't continue.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.887
A-All right, uh, j-just,
just give me a few.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.789
I'll put, I'll throw some
clothes on. I'll be right over.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.524
You promise?
Yeah, yeah, I promise.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.560
Okay.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.143
(chuckles)

32:03.990 --> 32:05.924
(doorbell chimes)

32:23.442 --> 32:25.444
*

32:27.013 --> 32:28.280
(knock at door)

32:28.314 --> 32:31.317
(door opens)

32:31.350 --> 32:32.951
Who is it? Who's there?

32:32.985 --> 32:34.520
Who the hell
do you think it is, Joan?

32:34.553 --> 32:36.155
It's Bob, you called me here.

32:36.188 --> 32:39.591
Oh, Bob. No, I thought
for a moment

32:39.625 --> 32:41.593
maybe Peter had come home.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.962
Yeah, I'm sorry
about Peter, Joan.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.998
You know what I'm sorry about?

32:46.032 --> 32:50.169
I'm sorry I gave up a wonderful
relationship with a man

32:50.202 --> 32:53.705
who truly cherished me,
a doctor no less,

32:53.739 --> 32:55.874
for you and this picture.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.676
Really, it's just too much.

32:57.709 --> 32:58.944
What are you talking about?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.046
You know goddamn well

33:00.079 --> 33:02.514
what I'm talking about.

33:02.548 --> 33:06.185
You and Davis,
cavorting behind my back.

33:06.218 --> 33:07.886
Oh, you're being ridiculous.
Am I?

33:07.919 --> 33:12.824
(chuckles)
Weekend rehearsals, my ass.

33:12.858 --> 33:14.860
How long have
you been sleeping with her?

33:14.893 --> 33:16.162
I'm not sleeping with her.

33:16.195 --> 33:18.297
I won't be made a fool of.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.866
I'm out, but don't worry,

33:20.899 --> 33:23.169
I won't stand in your way.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.737
I'm sure Warner
will let you recast.

33:25.771 --> 33:28.507
We're not recasting, Joan.
Jesus.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.043
This picture's only happening
because of you.

33:31.077 --> 33:33.845
Well, I'm glad
you remember that.

33:33.879 --> 33:37.483
What else do
you remember, Bob?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.318
Joan.
Hmm?

33:39.351 --> 33:42.388
Bob, do you remember

33:42.421 --> 33:45.891
our private rehearsals
on Autumn Leaves?

33:45.924 --> 33:48.026
Come on.

33:48.060 --> 33:51.363
Rehearse with me now, Bob.

33:51.397 --> 33:54.233
Take me through a love scene.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.602
There is no love
scene in the picture.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.170
(whispering):
Then I want a rewrite.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.406
Oh, goddamn it, Joan.
Will you knock it off?

34:00.439 --> 34:03.342
You think I don't
know what this is?

34:03.375 --> 34:04.910
What, you think you're
gonna get me into bed,

34:04.943 --> 34:06.912
I'm just gonna hand
the picture to you?

34:06.945 --> 34:09.548
That's exactly what
happened on Autumn Leaves.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.183
You saw me having coffee
with Cliff Robertson,

34:11.217 --> 34:12.451
next thing I know your
hand's down my pants.

34:12.484 --> 34:13.752
Screw you.

34:13.785 --> 34:15.087
No, not this time, Joan.

34:15.121 --> 34:17.022
Listen to me.

34:17.055 --> 34:19.425
I'm trying to hold onto my
marriage for Christ's sakes.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.260
Good, well...

34:24.096 --> 34:25.464
JOAN: Peter?

34:25.497 --> 34:27.065
What are you doing here?

34:27.099 --> 34:29.935
I thought you were
in Palm Springs.

34:29.968 --> 34:31.937
Yeah, the road got washed out.

34:31.970 --> 34:34.273
I'll see you on
the set, Joan.

34:40.011 --> 34:41.947
You want to explain that?

34:41.980 --> 34:46.818
Explain? To you?
(chuckles)

34:46.852 --> 34:50.989
I don't have to explain
a goddamn thing to you.

34:51.022 --> 34:53.592
You're the one who
left me this weekend,

34:53.625 --> 34:57.062
leaving me here all alone.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.831
I think it's
time to recast.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.066
Recast?

35:01.099 --> 35:03.169
Recast you.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.571
Your lines are stale.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.273
You delivery's predictable.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.507
I'm going downstairs.

35:08.540 --> 35:12.944
When I come back,
I want you gone.

35:12.978 --> 35:15.614
* And left you *

35:15.647 --> 35:18.617
* So you can *

35:18.650 --> 35:20.118
* Fly... *

35:23.489 --> 35:25.891
It's a relief!

35:35.367 --> 35:36.535
(doorbell chimes)

35:37.736 --> 35:39.971
Where is she?

35:44.810 --> 35:46.312
What the hell is this?

35:46.345 --> 35:47.679
I'm sorry, Miss Joan.

35:47.713 --> 35:50.316
She's small,
but she's quick.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.351
Why that looks
like an exclusive.

35:52.384 --> 35:55.120
In The Examiner,
in Louella's column.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.888
You deliberately called up

35:56.922 --> 36:00.192
that incontinent cow
just to scoop me.

36:00.226 --> 36:02.494
Thank you, Sven.
That'll be all for now.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.963
No, Sven's staying put.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.333
I want this young man
to bear witness.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.801
He should know whose carcass
it is he's been handling,

36:09.835 --> 36:12.003
and just how many others
in this town

36:12.037 --> 36:13.572
could identify it in the dark.

36:13.605 --> 36:16.208
That column has
already been written.

36:16.242 --> 36:18.844
"Joan Crawford's
Early, Tawdry Years."

36:18.877 --> 36:22.381
And it's been locked away
in my desk drawer since 1946,

36:22.414 --> 36:25.651
the last time you went
to Louella behind my back.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.887
Oh, I told you then, Hedda,
I didn't go to Louella

36:28.920 --> 36:30.589
about my divorce from Philip.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.424
No, she came to me.

36:32.458 --> 36:36.362
And you confirmed it. And after
I gave you your career back.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.829
Box Office Poison.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.231
That's what they
called her,

36:39.265 --> 36:41.500
until I started
promoting her in my column

36:41.533 --> 36:42.434
because I felt sorry for her.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.002
Well, she is right about that.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.272
When I was down
on my luck,

36:46.305 --> 36:49.941
Hedda is the only person
in this Christless town

36:49.975 --> 36:52.010
to extend a hand
in friendship,

36:52.043 --> 36:54.413
to show some
human decency.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.214
She didn't have to,

36:56.248 --> 37:01.253
and I have always been truly
grateful to her for doing it,

37:01.287 --> 37:02.721
truly, truly grateful.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.390
Well, then why would you
go to my mortal enemy?

37:04.423 --> 37:07.259
Because it was the only way

37:07.293 --> 37:09.928
I could get your attention.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.130
Thank you, Sven,
I'll see you on Friday.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.600
Hedda, Hedda.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.736
Yes.

37:17.769 --> 37:22.040
Let's go down to the pool,
soak up some vitamin D.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.276
(whispering):
Listen, we have to talk.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.411
Okay.

37:25.444 --> 37:26.912
Give me a moment to change.

37:30.115 --> 37:31.817
Oh.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.619
JOAN:
I'll just say it, Hedda.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.821
I'm in trouble.

37:35.854 --> 37:38.457
What kind of trouble?

37:38.490 --> 37:41.327
No, no, no. This
isn't for publication.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.764
I'm appealing to you
as a friend.

37:50.135 --> 37:53.472
All right. Closed.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.841
Shoot.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.344
I'm broke.

37:58.377 --> 38:01.913
Up to my eyeballs in debt.
No.

38:01.947 --> 38:05.351
No. You practically
own Pepsi-Cola.

38:05.384 --> 38:08.320
Pepsi-Cola owns me.

38:08.354 --> 38:10.288
Or it owned Al, at any rate,

38:10.322 --> 38:12.524
and when he died,
his debts became mine.

38:15.193 --> 38:16.695
Two million dollars.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.297
Hedda, that's what I owe.

38:19.331 --> 38:21.833
Two million dollars.

38:21.867 --> 38:23.502
Joan, I had no idea.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.471
No, nobody does,
and-and they mustn't.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.339
Look, I'm a single mother

38:27.373 --> 38:29.375
working in Hollywood.

38:29.408 --> 38:34.145
I've got three children whose
schooling is not yet complete.

38:34.179 --> 38:36.515
MAMACITA:
Cocktail time.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.420
Come on, I need a drink.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.625
All right.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.194
Look at this, Hedda.

38:49.227 --> 38:51.497
All of this could be gone
in an instant,

38:51.530 --> 38:54.800
everything I've worked
for my entire life.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.068
I mean, where, at my age,
am I going to find

38:57.102 --> 38:59.037
another rich man to save me?

38:59.070 --> 39:01.072
You've never needed a man.

39:01.106 --> 39:02.974
Neither one of us have.

39:03.008 --> 39:06.912
And yet we've always
been at their mercy.

39:06.945 --> 39:10.015
Hmm.
At least I have.

39:10.048 --> 39:12.751
You don't know how
lucky you are, Hedda,

39:12.784 --> 39:15.554
that being an actress
didn't work out for you,

39:15.587 --> 39:17.423
that you were never a star.

39:17.456 --> 39:21.893
I mean, you're the one who
has real power in this town.

39:21.927 --> 39:26.097
Yeah, well, this town,
it's in decline.

39:26.131 --> 39:28.434
It's becoming base and common.

39:28.467 --> 39:29.768
You know, pretty soon,

39:29.801 --> 39:31.770
I won't even be able
to shock it anymore.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.605
The whole thing's
gonna blow away,

39:33.639 --> 39:37.943
and all that'll be left
is the desert it's built on.

39:37.976 --> 39:41.379
Oh, thank you, Mamacita.

39:41.413 --> 39:43.214
Thank you, darling.

39:43.248 --> 39:45.751
A few more years.

39:45.784 --> 39:50.388
That is all I wanted,
just a few more years,
Hmm.

39:50.422 --> 39:53.892
but I've been
undermined, sabotaged.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.595
No, it's just not fair.

39:56.628 --> 39:59.631
Davis, she's never
been one of us.
No.

39:59.665 --> 40:02.768
She's never been a part
of this town, not like you have.

40:02.801 --> 40:06.772
And she doesn't need the work.
Woman lives like a Yankee.

40:06.805 --> 40:08.574
I just don't know
what I'm going to do.

40:08.607 --> 40:12.744
Don't you dare. No tears.

40:12.778 --> 40:17.082
Hedda is here.

40:17.115 --> 40:20.051
You want a few more years?

40:20.085 --> 40:23.154
What about five more?

40:23.188 --> 40:24.590
Because that's what another
Oscar will give you.
Oh!

40:24.623 --> 40:25.824
Yes.

40:25.857 --> 40:28.494
A down payment on
five more years.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.796
No, no, no, that
is impossible.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.397
That'll never happen.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.432
Bette has the showier role.

40:34.466 --> 40:37.235
Well, that's
a matter of opinion.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.872
And my opinion is
the only one that matters.

40:43.509 --> 40:45.611
(chuckles)

40:46.645 --> 40:48.046
Cheers.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.316
Tchin-tchin,
my darling.
Mm.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.995
Well, good morning, Miss
Davis, I am such a fan.

41:04.029 --> 41:05.263
Doughnut?

41:05.296 --> 41:06.498
No, coffee,

41:06.532 --> 41:07.766
black, in my dressing room.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.467
Oh, I'm not
craft service.

41:09.501 --> 41:11.537
I'm your leading man
on this picture.

41:12.738 --> 41:14.272
Beg your pardon?

41:14.305 --> 41:15.874
I'm Victor Buono.

41:15.907 --> 41:17.308
I'll be playing
your love interest.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.613
I was expecting someone...

41:21.647 --> 41:23.281
Thinner?

41:23.314 --> 41:26.217
Less... homosexual?

41:28.687 --> 41:29.921
Mm. Mm.

41:45.236 --> 41:46.905
(laughter and indistinct
conversations)

41:56.181 --> 41:58.416
BETTE: Thanks for the
great day, fellas.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.485
Say good night, B.D.
Oh.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.253
Good night, fellas.

42:02.287 --> 42:03.722
Ah!

42:09.861 --> 42:14.332
* Itsy bitsy teenie weenie
yellow polka-dot bikini *

42:14.365 --> 42:18.403
* That she wore
for the first time today *

42:18.436 --> 42:19.404
(louder):
* An itsy bitsy
teenie weenie... *

42:19.437 --> 42:20.906
Christ, this song!

42:20.939 --> 42:22.507
You don't like it

42:22.540 --> 42:25.543
because you can't wear one
anymore.

42:25.577 --> 42:29.514
* Two, three, four, stick
around we'll tell you more. *

42:29.547 --> 42:31.416
(music stops)

42:33.785 --> 42:35.687
Pack your bags, B.D.

42:35.721 --> 42:37.689
Why? Are we going
somewhere?

42:37.723 --> 42:39.357
Not me, you.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.559
To Maine for the entire summer.

42:41.593 --> 42:42.861
You can't do that.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.062
Watch me.

42:44.095 --> 42:46.431
Christ,
tonight I see you posing

42:46.464 --> 42:48.767
and laughing in front of
the grips like a streetwalker.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.368
You're jealous.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.870
I'd smack you
across the face for that

42:51.903 --> 42:53.872
if your braces
hadn't cost a fortune.

42:53.905 --> 42:55.741
You're jealous because men
don't look at you anymore

42:55.774 --> 42:56.875
and they look at me.

42:56.908 --> 42:58.710
You can't take it

42:58.744 --> 43:01.546
that your turn is over,
so you're punishing me.

43:01.579 --> 43:04.616
What a joke.

43:04.650 --> 43:07.585
For years when I was growing up,
all I ever heard from you

43:07.619 --> 43:09.254
was "Christ,
when is that old buzzard

43:09.287 --> 43:11.056
"Claudette Colbert gonna retire?

43:11.089 --> 43:13.725
When is Norma Shearer gonna
realize the ship has sailed?"

43:13.759 --> 43:16.061
I am not going to apologize
for having ambition!

43:16.094 --> 43:18.596
I am not going to apologize for
being a working mother

43:18.630 --> 43:20.098
who has to have opportunities

43:20.131 --> 43:22.901
so she can put food on the table
for her family.

43:22.934 --> 43:24.903
You know what those women
had that you don't, mother?

43:24.936 --> 43:26.104
Dignity.

43:26.137 --> 43:27.639
They moved aside
with class

43:27.673 --> 43:30.008
after their spin on
the carousel was over,

43:30.041 --> 43:32.477
and that's something
you refuse to do.

43:32.510 --> 43:34.245
And now look at you.

43:34.279 --> 43:38.784
You're single, lonely and
doing this ridiculous role

43:38.817 --> 43:41.920
because you can't live without
being in the spotlight.

43:41.953 --> 43:43.254
Well, guess what?

43:43.288 --> 43:45.156
Nobody wants you anymore.

43:45.190 --> 43:46.992
Nobody's watching you anymore.

43:47.025 --> 43:50.095
You see me out there
having fun and being young

43:50.128 --> 43:53.598
and taking my turn,
and you can't take it.

43:53.631 --> 43:55.266
So fine.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.602
I'll go, gladly.

43:57.635 --> 44:01.239
Anything to get away
from you and your sadness.

44:23.594 --> 44:26.698
(ringing)

44:30.268 --> 44:31.469
Hello?

44:31.502 --> 44:34.072
Is it one of the kids?

44:36.074 --> 44:38.376
One of yours.

44:38.409 --> 44:39.644
Bette Davis.

44:39.677 --> 44:41.079
Oh.

44:44.115 --> 44:45.751
(grunts)

44:45.784 --> 44:47.886
Bette?

45:00.298 --> 45:01.733
(knocking)

45:02.934 --> 45:05.003
Well, here
I am, Bette.

45:05.036 --> 45:06.337
What could you possibly need

45:06.371 --> 45:07.973
that couldn't wait
till tomorrow?

45:09.240 --> 45:11.409
A friend.

45:13.111 --> 45:14.579
Oh...

45:14.612 --> 45:16.614
(crying)

45:18.549 --> 45:19.918
ROBERT:
She'll be back.

45:19.951 --> 45:21.419
She's a teenager.

45:21.452 --> 45:23.554
You can't take anything
they say to heart.

45:23.588 --> 45:24.956
You should hear the way
my kids talked to me

45:24.990 --> 45:26.091
when they were teenagers.

45:26.124 --> 45:27.725
Hell, they still do.

45:27.759 --> 45:29.194
But she's right, Bob.
That's the trouble.

45:29.227 --> 45:30.395
My time has passed.

45:30.428 --> 45:32.430
Oh, that's horseshit, Bette.

45:32.463 --> 45:34.232
There's a scene in Eve
from the back of the car

45:34.265 --> 45:36.301
when Margo's talking
about the long climb up

45:36.334 --> 45:38.369
and all the things
you drop along the way

45:38.403 --> 45:40.772
that you forget
you're going to need later.

45:40.806 --> 45:42.974
I just turned 40
when we did that scene

45:43.008 --> 45:44.742
and I remember thinking,

45:44.776 --> 45:47.578
"Thank Christ
that will never be me."

45:50.448 --> 45:52.317
But it is.

45:52.350 --> 45:53.985
That's exactly what happened.

45:55.787 --> 45:58.456
All my failed marriages,
my own daughter hates me.

45:58.489 --> 46:00.058
And for what?

46:00.091 --> 46:01.759
For the work.

46:01.793 --> 46:02.928
Mm.

46:02.961 --> 46:04.762
The goddamn work.

46:04.796 --> 46:06.664
My one true love,

46:06.697 --> 46:08.766
and now that's going
to leave me.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.936
You're a star, Bette.

46:10.969 --> 46:13.939
Just as much of a star now
as you were ten years ago.

46:13.972 --> 46:15.440
20 years ago.

46:15.473 --> 46:19.310
A star whose leading man
is a chubby homosexual.

46:19.344 --> 46:22.013
Ah, now we get to it.

46:25.016 --> 46:26.617
Is this what it's come to?

46:26.651 --> 46:29.654
What do you mean,
"Is this what it's come to?"

46:29.687 --> 46:32.924
Bette, he's a brilliant artist.

46:32.958 --> 46:35.760
You say Crawford's no actor,
well Victor Buono is.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.996
He comes
from Broadway,

46:38.029 --> 46:40.165
for Christ's sakes.
I am not gonna fire him.

46:40.198 --> 46:43.801
I don't want you to fire him.

46:43.835 --> 46:46.537
I don't want you to fire him.
I don't know what I want.

46:51.676 --> 46:54.379
Bette, listen.

46:54.412 --> 46:56.982
I understand
everything you said.

46:57.015 --> 46:59.517
You've had
a brilliant career.

46:59.550 --> 47:01.953
Me, I'm still on the B-list.

47:01.987 --> 47:05.190
I'm working like a dog to keep
a roof over my family's head.

47:05.223 --> 47:06.657
I missed my kids growing up,

47:06.691 --> 47:09.327
and my wife now wants
to give me the heave-ho.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.862
At least you've got an Oscar.

47:10.896 --> 47:12.063
Two.

47:12.097 --> 47:15.867
Two. I beg your pardon.

47:15.901 --> 47:18.469
I think maybe
we both mucked things up.

47:18.503 --> 47:20.906
Oh, you haven't
mucked up anything.

47:20.939 --> 47:23.741
You're a fine director, Bob.

47:23.774 --> 47:26.244
A really fine director.

47:26.277 --> 47:28.046
You should be very proud.

47:28.079 --> 47:30.215
And you,
you started from nothing.

47:30.248 --> 47:32.817
Look at all you've accomplished.

47:32.850 --> 47:35.820
My grandfather
was a U.S. Senator.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.256
My cousin is Nelson Rockefeller.

47:38.289 --> 47:40.926
And you overcame all that.

47:40.959 --> 47:43.594

both of us to get it.

51:03.794 --> 51:04.762
