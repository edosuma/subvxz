00:52.052 --> 00:54.721
Welcome to Air Canada
nonstop service,

00:54.805 --> 00:56.139
Toronto to Paris.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.473
Our flying time today

00:57.558 --> 01:00.476
is an estimated
7 hours, 20 minutes.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.645
Please check that your
seat belt is fastened

01:02.730 --> 01:05.648
and that your chair back
is in the upright position.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.568
We'll be taking off shortly.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.611
Kate?

01:13.615 --> 01:14.741
Yes?

01:14.825 --> 01:18.035
Are you prepared to have
a pleasant flight?

01:18.120 --> 01:19.412
Yes.

01:19.496 --> 01:22.623
Tell me, Kate, what
are you thinking about?

01:24.793 --> 01:26.919
Twisted steel.

01:27.004 --> 01:27.962
Ball of fire.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.423
A naked baby screaming
for his mother.

01:30.507 --> 01:34.010
Kate, what happened
to your little stone cottage?

01:34.094 --> 01:36.053
Picture it now.

01:36.138 --> 01:39.098
OK.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.602
Oh, my god!

01:42.686 --> 01:44.979
And don't forget
your takeoff mantra.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.607
What are the words you chant
softly in your head?

01:47.691 --> 01:50.943
We're going down!
We're going down!

01:51.028 --> 01:52.028
Kate...

01:53.906 --> 01:54.406
OK.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.789
OK.

02:05.167 --> 02:09.419
I Love Paris In the springtime

02:09.505 --> 02:11.047
I Love...

02:11.882 --> 02:13.299
Hello? Hello?

02:13.383 --> 02:16.302
I really think you gave me
the wrong mantra.

02:17.513 --> 02:20.306
I don't love Paris,
I don't like the French,

02:20.390 --> 02:22.892
and I don't want
to go on this trip.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.979
Oh... god, no!

02:27.064 --> 02:29.190
Kate, you can do this.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.274
I can't do this!

02:30.359 --> 02:34.153
I don't belong
on this airplane!

02:34.238 --> 02:37.156
Let me out of here!

02:37.241 --> 02:39.492
I don't want to die!

02:52.631 --> 02:55.466
Kate, your full refund.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.137
Thank you.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.681
You can get the money back

03:01.765 --> 03:02.765
on my ticket.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.971
Money's not the issue, Kate.

03:03.976 --> 03:08.187
I wanted you to come
with me to exper... What?

03:08.272 --> 03:09.438
Is that them?

03:09.773 --> 03:11.649
I don't want to see
my family tonight.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.859
You never do.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.069
Have you noticed how,
since we're engaged,

03:15.153 --> 03:16.195
they don't knock anymore?

03:16.280 --> 03:17.530
They love you.

03:17.614 --> 03:18.823
My family gives me

03:18.907 --> 03:20.825
an unsigned birthday card.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.243
Kate, come with me.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.203
I'll give you
10 milligrams of valium,

03:24.288 --> 03:25.288
a shot of Stoli,

03:25.372 --> 03:28.499
and we'll be there
before you know it.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.419
How can you not want
to go to Paris?

03:31.503 --> 03:32.545
You're a history teacher.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.588
Shame on you.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.548
Charlie, the French,

03:35.632 --> 03:37.216
you know they hate us.

03:37.301 --> 03:38.384
They smoke.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.719
They have a whole relationship

03:39.803 --> 03:41.721
to dairy products, which
I don't understand.

03:41.805 --> 03:42.930
Kate, something's wrong

03:43.015 --> 03:45.016
with the cable!

03:45.100 --> 03:47.059
Is the box set on three?

03:47.144 --> 03:49.520
A week in Paris with
the man you love?

03:49.605 --> 03:51.063
Suture demonstrations.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.231
Midnight strolls?

03:52.316 --> 03:53.608
Medicare meetings.

03:53.692 --> 03:54.734
The Eiffel Tower.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.736
The Eiffel Tower...

03:56.820 --> 03:58.571
I'd love to see
the Eiffel Tower.

03:58.655 --> 03:59.697
OK, Then.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.992
Great.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.912
I'm not supposed
to leave the country

04:05.996 --> 04:07.705
until my immigration interview.

04:07.789 --> 04:08.915
I'm taking that.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.918
No, no. No, you're not.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.753
Make something up.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.129
Tell them your cousin Bridget

04:15.213 --> 04:16.339
fell in the Seine.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.464
They'll find out

04:17.548 --> 04:18.591
I have no cousin Bridget

04:18.675 --> 04:19.675
and deport me.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.844
Like the one time
I smoked pot...

04:21.928 --> 04:23.471
I didn't want to,

04:23.555 --> 04:25.139
I had a horrible time,

04:25.223 --> 04:27.308
and Ronny Templeton's
little brother

04:27.392 --> 04:29.060
called the police,
and we got arrested.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.687
The one time I ever
did anything illegal.

04:32.356 --> 04:33.481
Bure drops it in...

04:33.565 --> 04:35.775
They put cheese on both pizzas.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.818
Herb, this is you,
you didn't check.

04:37.903 --> 04:38.945
Take it back.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.696
You know Kate hates cheese.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.864
I'll pick it off.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.408
Here's a list of stuff I want.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.743
Forget it. Kate's not going.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.328
I'm not going. Why not?

04:47.412 --> 04:49.497
Is it the French thing?

04:49.581 --> 04:51.248
No, it's the flying thing.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.168
It's not the French thing
or the flying thing.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.795
I'm not supposed to travel

04:55.879 --> 04:57.630
until my Canadian
citizenship clears.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.632
Hon, we got to move it.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.051
Oh, Kate, I almost forgot,

05:02.135 --> 05:03.302
the Merediths

05:03.387 --> 05:05.972
have put their house
on the market.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.360
Why are we looking at
a house we can't afford?

05:19.444 --> 05:22.488
Charlie, there's something
I have to tell you.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.116
Since I turned 21,

05:25.200 --> 05:27.076
I've been putting money
aside every week

05:27.160 --> 05:29.537
into a savings account,

05:29.621 --> 05:31.872
which I then rolled into
high-yield term deposits

05:31.957 --> 05:34.208
with interest rates
close to 14 %.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.085
What are you talking about?

05:36.169 --> 05:37.962
I've made us a nest egg.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.007
How many eggs?

05:41.091 --> 05:41.907
45,782 eggs.

05:47.806 --> 05:50.182
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

05:51.393 --> 05:53.102
I wanted it to be a surprise.

05:53.770 --> 05:54.770
It's a surprise.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.939
It's a big surprise.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.026
So, with a little help
from your parents,

06:00.110 --> 06:02.278
we could probably afford this.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.365
My whole life is passing
before my eyes,

06:06.450 --> 06:08.993
and we don't even
have children yet.

06:13.832 --> 06:14.874
Hey.

06:17.461 --> 06:18.461
Hey.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.689
Come to Paris with me.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.208
Hi. Right on time.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.542
Saved me from the news.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.211
Bonsoir, chérie.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.838
Hey. Hi, how's it going?

07:02.923 --> 07:05.174
Good. It's just one
conference after another,

07:05.258 --> 07:07.259
but this city,
it's amazing, Kate.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.930
It's so beautiful,
it just casts a spell.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.056
How was dinner?

07:12.140 --> 07:13.724
They used this sauce,

07:13.809 --> 07:15.309
it had a taste
I never experienced.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.812
C'était incroyable!

07:17.896 --> 07:21.190
The sauces have
to be incroyables

07:21.274 --> 07:22.441
to cover up the horse meat.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.026
I saw this segment on
60 Minutes...

07:24.111 --> 07:25.861
You keep watching
all those shows,

07:25.946 --> 07:27.613
you'll never leave the house.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.082
Hey!

07:38.166 --> 07:39.208
Hey. I can't talk.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.502
I'm with the guys
at this hip club.

07:41.586 --> 07:42.795
I can't hear you.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.673
Sweetie pie, we need to
talk about the house.

07:45.757 --> 07:46.966
I promise you, tomorrow.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.468
I got to go, hon.
Love you. Bye.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.143
I talked to the broker

07:57.227 --> 08:00.312
and told her we are ready
to make an offer

08:00.397 --> 08:02.523
as soon as I talk to Charlie.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.983
You guys are crazy.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.651
I'm never buying a house

08:05.735 --> 08:07.903
or anything else
worth anything.

08:08.572 --> 08:09.572
Why not?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.490
Because you think you
own something like that,

08:11.575 --> 08:13.868
when, really, it
winds up owning you.

08:13.952 --> 08:14.952
It becomes your life,

08:15.036 --> 08:16.328
and then one night,

08:16.413 --> 08:17.663
someone leaves their cigarette,

08:17.747 --> 08:19.415
and it all burns.

08:22.794 --> 08:23.878
Honey, hello?

08:23.962 --> 08:25.379
Kate? Kate?

08:25.463 --> 08:27.840
Yeah, it's me, Charlie.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.342
Are you all right?
Is something wrong?

08:30.427 --> 08:33.386
No... Yeah...
Something's happened.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.847
What? What's wrong?

08:34.931 --> 08:37.183
Oh, Kate... Kate, I'm just...

08:37.267 --> 08:38.893
I'm just so happy, you know?

08:38.977 --> 08:40.102
I'm just so happy

08:40.187 --> 08:41.437
and so...

08:41.520 --> 08:42.520
Fucked up.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.023
I fucked up, definitely.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.608
But it's destiny, Kate.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.067
That's what it is.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.862
What are you saying?
What's destiny?

08:49.946 --> 08:53.532
Destiny... Oh, Kate.
Well, I met this woman,

08:53.617 --> 08:56.952
this apparition, this goddesse.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.496
Goddesse?

08:59.581 --> 09:01.207
It's French for "goddess,"

09:01.291 --> 09:04.168
and so is she. She's French.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.212
I've never, ever felt
this way before.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.421
I feel I could do anything.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.547
I could rule the world,

09:08.632 --> 09:10.090
climb the highest mountain.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.676
I could walk into
a men's room and pee,

09:12.761 --> 09:15.304
even with some big guy
waiting behind me.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.390
What? What are you saying?

09:18.475 --> 09:20.351
Charlie, are you...

09:20.435 --> 09:23.562
Kate, I'm not coming back.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.649
I'm in love... Kate.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.568
Love, like in a sonnet

09:31.321 --> 09:34.448
Or like a...

09:35.200 --> 09:37.326
Like love.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.748
I'm sorry, Kate.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.502
I'm so sorry.

09:56.513 --> 09:57.513
Charlie?

10:00.308 --> 10:02.559
Welcome to Air Canada
nonstop service,

10:02.644 --> 10:04.061
Toronto to Paris.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.312
Our flying time today

10:05.397 --> 10:07.439
is an estimated
7 hours, 20 minutes.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.192
Please make sure that
your seat belt is fastened

10:10.277 --> 10:12.820
and your chair back
is in the upright position.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.405
We'll be taking off shortly.

10:14.489 --> 10:17.574
We hope you have
a pleasant flight.

10:43.018 --> 10:46.186
I Hate Paris In the springtime

10:46.271 --> 10:50.232
I Hate Paris In the fall

10:50.317 --> 10:52.693
I Hate Paris

10:52.777 --> 10:55.404
In The Summer When it sizzles

10:55.488 --> 10:56.989
I Hate Paris

10:57.073 --> 10:59.658
In The Winter When it drizzles

10:59.743 --> 11:01.827
I Hate Paris

11:01.911 --> 11:05.164
Oh, Why, Oh, Why
Do I hate Paris?

11:05.248 --> 11:08.417
Because My Love Is there

11:08.501 --> 11:12.671
With His Slut girlfriend

11:18.470 --> 11:19.720
This is my first time flying.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.598
I'm just kind of nervous.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.016
First time.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.604
Do you speak any English?

11:28.688 --> 11:29.897
Didn't your mother

11:29.981 --> 11:31.732
ever teach you about staring?

11:31.816 --> 11:33.984
What do you think,
the plane will crash

11:34.069 --> 11:37.488
and we are on the ground
in a thousand pieces dead?

11:37.572 --> 11:38.732
I promise you, if it happens,

11:38.782 --> 11:40.866
you won't feel a thing.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.453
You're French, aren't you?

11:44.537 --> 11:45.829
Luc Teyssier.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.582
How have you got around
your whole life?

11:48.666 --> 11:50.000
Or do you just stay
in your house

11:50.085 --> 11:51.335
with the doors locked?

11:51.419 --> 11:53.796
I get around
as nature intended,

12:01.471 --> 12:02.471
What was that?

12:02.555 --> 12:03.555
What did she say?

12:03.640 --> 12:04.890
That sounded serious.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.975
The pilot says there is
a crack in the engine,

12:07.060 --> 12:09.311
but he take off anyway.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.646
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:10.730 --> 12:13.232
please remember that
the use of cellular phones

12:13.316 --> 12:14.733
and other electronic devices

12:14.818 --> 12:17.194
is forbidden during takeoff.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.447
I don't know

12:20.532 --> 12:21.907
what they taught you in France,

12:21.991 --> 12:23.075
but rude and interesting

12:23.159 --> 12:24.660
are not the same thing.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.330
Oh! God!

12:51.187 --> 12:53.188
We hope you enjoy the flight.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.441
OK, OK, OK...

12:55.525 --> 12:57.818
OK, OK...

12:57.902 --> 12:59.862
Folks, we're third in line

12:59.946 --> 13:00.946
for takeoff,

13:01.030 --> 13:02.114
so just relax.

13:02.198 --> 13:06.201
We should be in the air
in just a couple of minutes.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.995
I've almost got the
stone cottage going.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.289
Could you please
stop looking at me?

13:10.373 --> 13:11.498
Is incredible.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.125
What? What?

13:13.209 --> 13:15.711
Your every muscle
in your body is tense,

13:15.795 --> 13:17.713
even the lids of your eyes.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.756
Your nostrils are...
Are closing up.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.550
How do you do that?

13:21.634 --> 13:24.720
Me, I love to fly,
especially this moment,

13:24.804 --> 13:27.890
the plane getting ready
to charge the runway,

13:27.974 --> 13:30.893
the engines screaming,
the pressure building,

13:30.977 --> 13:34.396
the force of it slams you
back in the seat,

13:34.481 --> 13:38.400
and then, whoosh,
you are in the air.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.903
Everything else is behind you.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.238
There's only one
other place in life

13:43.323 --> 13:45.991
where I feel this kind
of exhilaration.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.242
Oh, yeah? Where's that?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.453
Oh, no, no, no. Don't tell me.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.163
Just let me guess.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.291
Flight attendants,
prepare for takeoff.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.417
Oh, god.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.754
I don't think I can do this.

14:04.594 --> 14:05.761
Did you ever think

14:05.845 --> 14:07.304
that maybe it is
not the airplane?

14:07.388 --> 14:08.680
What's not the airplane?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.724
That maybe it is something else

14:10.808 --> 14:11.892
you are afraid of.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.018
What?

14:13.102 --> 14:14.061
Must I say it?

14:14.145 --> 14:15.145
Can I stop you?

14:15.230 --> 14:18.273
It is obvious to me.
I know your type.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.399
What type is that?

14:19.484 --> 14:21.610
You're afraid to really live.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.694
Oh, god.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.404
You are afraid of life.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.031
You are afraid of love.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.741
You are afraid of sex.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.034
That is ridiculous.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.371
I can tell from your face
and how you dress

14:32.455 --> 14:34.206
with your little white buttons

14:34.290 --> 14:36.708
all the way up to here.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.419
In bed, you are waiting
under the covers,

14:39.504 --> 14:41.088
the light is going off,

14:41.172 --> 14:42.381
and then, like a rabbit...

14:42.465 --> 14:43.924
What?

14:44.008 --> 14:45.926
What is the matter with you?

14:46.010 --> 14:47.219
You don't know me.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.887
I know that you are afraid...

14:48.972 --> 14:50.138
You don't know what I do,

14:50.223 --> 14:51.932
and Charlie never complained.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.392
Stop that.

14:53.476 --> 14:54.476
There were a few months

14:54.561 --> 14:55.936
where I didn't feel like it.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.938
That was a long time ago,

14:58.022 --> 15:00.732
and I was in between
teaching jobs. Yes.

15:00.817 --> 15:01.817
For you to sit there

15:01.901 --> 15:03.569
with that smug expression

15:03.653 --> 15:05.404
and tell me that
I have a problem

15:05.488 --> 15:07.739
with my life and my Charlie

15:21.170 --> 15:23.755
You're just some
nicotine-saturated

15:23.840 --> 15:26.258
and, sorry to say,
hygiene-deficient

15:26.342 --> 15:27.426
Frenchman!

15:27.510 --> 15:29.553
Look...

15:29.637 --> 15:31.847
What a fantastic view?

15:37.895 --> 15:39.229
Now, if you will excuse me,

15:39.314 --> 15:42.774
I must go do
as nature intended.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.151
Pardon, monsieur.

16:03.838 --> 16:07.674
Sir, I'm sorry,
there's no smoking on this plane.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.552
OK, then can I have
two glasses with ice?

16:32.617 --> 16:35.243
Excuse me. Can I
ask you something?

16:36.663 --> 16:38.914
It's Luke, isn't it?

16:38.998 --> 16:41.333
Luc.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.543
No, not Luc... Luc.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.003
Luc?

16:47.048 --> 16:48.590
You want to ask me
something, or no?

16:48.675 --> 16:49.925
No. Forget it.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.010
I forget already.

16:52.095 --> 16:56.306
Did you mean all
that stuff you said,

16:56.391 --> 16:57.849
or were you just
trying to anger me?

16:57.934 --> 16:59.351
Do I look like
the kind of person

16:59.435 --> 17:01.075
that doesn't know
how to have a good time?

17:01.104 --> 17:05.648
You were how old
when you lost it?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.608
It? What it?

17:07.694 --> 17:10.362
You know, it. Your flower.

17:10.445 --> 17:11.863
My flower.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.366
My flower is none
of your business.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.535
I ask you because some people,

17:16.618 --> 17:18.537
they rush toward
the fateful moment,

17:18.621 --> 17:21.330
their bodies bursting
to discover.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.750
Others, they guard it
like some precious gift,

17:23.835 --> 17:24.960
and they wait and wait.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.712
You, I suppose, rushed.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.046
Like a bull.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.424
I have a clear
picture in my mind.

17:30.508 --> 17:31.550
A young bull.

17:31.634 --> 17:32.718
How young?

17:33.136 --> 17:34.177
13.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.470
13?

17:35.555 --> 17:36.888
No, you are right.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.516
I was 12. Magda.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.268
She was a putain...

17:41.352 --> 17:42.561
A...prostitute.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.896
She lived just outside
of my town,

17:44.981 --> 17:45.981
just by a little bridge.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.608
She was... Not beautiful,

17:48.693 --> 17:50.902
but she had this mouth.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.405
Oh, there was another
world waiting there.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.407
But I did not have
the money for the kissing.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.534
Only for the... You know.

17:57.618 --> 17:58.785
I don't understand.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.829
To kiss a prostitute,
it costs more.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.080
It has always been.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.499
Oh, well, that makes sense.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.501
A kiss is so... So intimate.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.919
You could probably disconnect

18:08.004 --> 18:10.505
from everything else,
but a kiss...

18:10.590 --> 18:12.215
Two people's lips together,

18:12.300 --> 18:13.341
and their breath,

18:13.426 --> 18:15.969
a little bit of their souls...

18:21.893 --> 18:23.560
All I mean is that a kiss

18:23.644 --> 18:24.978
is where the romance is.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.855
That is what I thought back then,

18:26.939 --> 18:29.941
so I stole 50 francs
from my brother Antoine,

18:30.026 --> 18:31.067
and I went back,

18:31.152 --> 18:32.444
and I kissed Magda
for half an hour.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.779
It was very good.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.032
Now you.

18:37.950 --> 18:38.950
Now me what?

18:39.035 --> 18:40.035
It is your turn.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.411
I tell you, now you tell me.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.371
I am all ears.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.374
All right. Yeah...

18:46.459 --> 18:48.710
No, I didn't... I...

18:48.795 --> 18:50.170
I didn't rush, you were right,

18:50.254 --> 18:52.130
but I didn't hide
from it, either.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.507
I wanted it to be great.

18:53.591 --> 18:56.218
I was... 18.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.804
Jeff the jock.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.681
My basement. Valentine's day.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.059
Jeopardy! In the background.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.477
It's a game show on TV.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.813
Jeopardy! We have it.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.097
Jeff said it would last longer

19:09.106 --> 19:12.484
with the show on
to distract him.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.689
He got all the answers wrong

19:13.736 --> 19:15.153
except for sports.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.823
By double Jeopardy!,
he was done.

19:17.907 --> 19:18.907
By final Jeopardy!,

19:18.991 --> 19:21.868
he was on his way home, so...

19:21.953 --> 19:23.829
Yeah, the first time was bad,

19:23.913 --> 19:25.622
but since then, it's
been mainly good,

19:25.706 --> 19:27.027
and then I found
somebody special,

19:27.083 --> 19:28.416
so it was great.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.088
Could I ask you something?

19:35.383 --> 19:36.591
Do you believe in love,

19:36.676 --> 19:38.426
the kind that lasts forever?

19:41.138 --> 19:42.722
I loved my mother.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.058
No. Everybody
loves their mother,

19:45.142 --> 19:47.185
even people who
hate their mothers.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.187
Is one man meant for one woman?

19:49.272 --> 19:50.397
That is the question.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.607
It is not
an interesting question.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.860
It is the question
of a little girl

19:54.944 --> 19:56.862
who believes in fairy tales.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.530
It's an everyone question,

19:58.614 --> 19:59.781
one that everybody thinks

19:59.866 --> 20:00.907
they have the answer to,

20:00.992 --> 20:03.910
until, one day,
something happens.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.954
Something happened?

20:10.293 --> 20:12.627
Look, I understand.
I understand.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.879
One love for you

20:13.963 --> 20:15.338
would be like
having to eat home

20:15.423 --> 20:17.465
for the rest of your life...

20:17.550 --> 20:19.384
And you probably like to go out

20:19.468 --> 20:21.052
to a different restaurant

20:21.137 --> 20:22.262
every chance you get.

20:23.431 --> 20:24.389
Careful, now.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.473
What's that?

20:25.558 --> 20:26.558
It is nothing.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.101
Are you hiding something?

20:28.185 --> 20:29.436
I have to go.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.105
I have to go again.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.231
Again?

20:52.543 --> 20:53.960
Parfait.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.934
Why'd you let me drink so much?

21:51.018 --> 21:52.339
Me? I did not let you
do anything.

21:52.395 --> 21:53.812
You did it yourself.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.857
And I will give you
a ride into Paris, OK.?

21:57.942 --> 22:01.361
It will save you a lot
of money, believe me.

22:01.445 --> 22:04.572
After what we have been
through together...

22:04.657 --> 22:06.408
Where are you staying?

22:06.492 --> 22:08.076
George V.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.208
"Nothing to declare."
That is you.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.334
Me, they're going to stop.

22:16.419 --> 22:17.460
They always do.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.505
I meet you outside,
one minute maximum.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.513
Your passport and plane ticket.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.813
Would you open your bag?

22:37.940 --> 22:39.274
Wait for me.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.819
That won't be necessary.

22:43.529 --> 22:44.863
What are you doing here?

22:45.281 --> 22:47.615
Don't you think
a cop gets a vacation?

22:50.411 --> 22:52.078
Give him back his papers.

22:59.795 --> 23:03.298
Look... there's Louise.

23:06.802 --> 23:11.056
I need a taxi to the
George V in Paris.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.477
I'll call you Monday.
We'll have a drink.

23:15.644 --> 23:19.647
Why wait till Monday?

23:20.316 --> 23:22.650
I've got something...

23:24.737 --> 23:26.488
Never mind... let's go.

23:36.457 --> 23:38.625
Papa, why are you looking
through the man's things?

23:40.878 --> 23:43.838
The same reason I look
through your room when you're asleep.

23:44.048 --> 23:47.008
To protect my loved ones
from themselves.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.510
You won't find anything in there.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.012
Are you really a thief?

23:51.097 --> 23:53.515
Me?

23:55.226 --> 23:56.851
Daddy says you saved his life.

23:56.936 --> 24:00.230
It's true. You see this little scar?

24:00.314 --> 24:03.233
Luc stopped it
from going all the way over here.

24:03.317 --> 24:06.486
He's no criminal.
That's what I keep telling him.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.072
To the left, Louise.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.506
Oui, madame?

24:26.590 --> 24:28.716
Yes, bonjour.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.885
Do you speak any English?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.221
Of course.
This is the George V,

24:33.305 --> 24:34.973
not some backpacker's hovel.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.100
Hovel?

24:37.184 --> 24:38.560
Of course not.

24:38.644 --> 24:39.811
Could you tell me which room

24:39.895 --> 24:41.771
Charlie Lytton is
staying in, please?

24:42.898 --> 24:45.775
Dr. Charles Lytton.
He's expecting me.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.986
I'm afraid no.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.112
No?

24:49.196 --> 24:50.238
No, madame.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.158
Perhaps madame could try
the courtesy phone.

24:54.285 --> 24:56.536
Well, madame has tried
the courtesy phone.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.079
Do not disturb.

25:00.958 --> 25:03.501
Look, I just spent

25:03.586 --> 25:06.379
seven hours on an airplane

25:08.924 --> 25:10.842
I'm tired, and I'm hungry,

25:10.926 --> 25:12.760
and I just want
to see my fiancé.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.888
Now, are you going to help me?

25:14.972 --> 25:18.183
It is my duty
to vigorously safeguard

25:18.267 --> 25:20.185
the privacy of our guests,

25:20.269 --> 25:22.228
and if our guests
need safeguarding

25:22.313 --> 25:23.730
from their own fiancées,

25:23.814 --> 25:26.649
well, after all,
unlike some countries,

25:26.734 --> 25:29.861
France is not a nation
of puritanical hypocrites.

25:41.790 --> 25:42.916
Hey.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.918
Hey, hey, hey.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.254
I just gave you 100 francs.

25:48.339 --> 25:49.464
Oui, madame,

25:49.548 --> 25:51.216
and I took it. Merci.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.093
If there is
anything else I can do,

25:54.178 --> 25:55.678
please let me know.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.506
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.174
You are American, no?

26:36.762 --> 26:38.346
For the moment.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.889
Well, forgive me for intruding,

26:39.974 --> 26:41.933
but I saw you sitting here,

26:42.017 --> 26:43.393
looking a little sad.

26:43.477 --> 26:45.728
Why should such
a beautiful woman

26:45.813 --> 26:47.772
look so sad, I asked myself.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.941
Have you got an hour?

26:50.025 --> 26:51.442
As a matter of fact,

26:51.527 --> 26:53.111
always.

26:54.822 --> 26:57.699
Let me help you
to forget your sadness.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.367
Remember you are in Paris,

26:59.451 --> 27:01.369
City of Love.

27:02.162 --> 27:03.204
Can I ask you something?

27:03.289 --> 27:04.372
Of course.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.832
Can you urinate

27:05.916 --> 27:07.834
with someone standing
right behind you?

27:09.920 --> 27:12.463
I think I could manage it.

27:15.592 --> 27:18.011
Are you going
to be the someone?

27:20.597 --> 27:24.017
Me? No. That's not
what I meant.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.352
So...

27:26.437 --> 27:28.354
You would like that I arrange

27:28.439 --> 27:31.232
for someone else
to stand next to me?

27:31.317 --> 27:32.859
It could be arranged.

27:32.943 --> 27:35.737
Perhaps Pierre, Monique...

27:36.572 --> 27:38.364
You have the face of an angel,

27:38.449 --> 27:42.243
but I'm delighted to find
the mind is a little devil.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.369
Hey, hey,

27:43.454 --> 27:44.871
look, Mister,

27:44.955 --> 27:46.372
this will get you nowhere.

27:46.457 --> 27:48.541
I'm waiting to meet my fiancé.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.376
If he sees you bothering me,

27:50.461 --> 27:52.170
even talking to me,

27:52.254 --> 27:54.005
he'll walk right over here...

28:43.180 --> 28:45.556
What are you doing here?
You only work the metro.

28:45.641 --> 28:49.477
No more.
With this suit, I'm a new man.

28:57.486 --> 28:58.694
Charlie?

29:00.906 --> 29:03.991
Hey, you said you'd
give me a ride.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.035
You said... Where are we?

29:06.120 --> 29:07.120
Your hotel.

29:07.204 --> 29:09.038
I take you to your room.

29:09.123 --> 29:10.498
I don't have a room.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.999
Someone has taken my room,

29:12.084 --> 29:15.044
someone in 4-inch heels,
a red dress...

29:16.505 --> 29:17.880
Oh, my god.

29:17.965 --> 29:19.465
My bags.

29:19.550 --> 29:20.591
What?

29:20.676 --> 29:22.009
My bags are gone.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.886
What? They can't be gone.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.221
How can they?

29:25.305 --> 29:26.472
Why look under there?

29:26.557 --> 29:29.851
I didn't lose my keys.
I lost my suitcase!

29:29.935 --> 29:32.895
Where did you put them down?

29:32.980 --> 29:34.355
I fainted right there.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.442
Oh, my money, my passport,
my vitamins...

29:37.526 --> 29:38.651
May I be of service?

29:43.824 --> 29:45.283
You tell him!

29:45.367 --> 29:47.034
How could you let this happen?

29:47.119 --> 29:48.411
What is your problem?

29:48.495 --> 29:50.204
They're my bags!

29:50.289 --> 29:53.082
I am upset because
it is my country

29:53.167 --> 29:54.250
and this is a scandal.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.960
Do you remember anything?

29:56.044 --> 29:57.295
I was sitting here,

29:57.379 --> 30:00.465
then that guy came
and talked to me...

30:00.549 --> 30:02.758
Then I saw Charlie.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.427
Oh, here we go again.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.553
Here. Sit, sit, sit.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.555
Breathe in... Breathe out...

30:07.639 --> 30:08.639
Breathe in...

30:08.724 --> 30:09.849
I'm breathing!

30:09.933 --> 30:11.225
You know, all men are bastards.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.644
Well, some are just
trying to help.

30:13.729 --> 30:16.272
I never thought I'd say this,

30:16.356 --> 30:17.565
but it's true.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.900
All men are bastards.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.735
The guy talking to you,

30:20.819 --> 30:22.236
- he was...
- A bastard.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.572
A Euro-trash-in-Armani bastard.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.866
He wore a black suit
with a yellow shirt?

30:26.950 --> 30:28.242
Yeah.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.619
- You know him?
- Come.

30:29.703 --> 30:30.745
Of course.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.914
All you bastards
know each other.

30:34.374 --> 30:35.500
Bastard.

30:38.420 --> 30:39.670
All right, all right.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.172
You wait here,

30:41.256 --> 30:43.758
I go get the... My car,

30:43.842 --> 30:46.886
and we go get your stuff, OK.?

31:27.302 --> 31:29.845
So who's this guy
who stole my bags?

31:29.930 --> 31:32.306
Bub.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.641
Bub?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.142
No, Bub.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.644
Bub, like...

31:36.728 --> 31:37.812
Bub Dylan.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.230
Bob.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.065
Oui. Bahhb.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.234
Now, why are you helping me?

31:43.318 --> 31:44.443
Why?

31:44.528 --> 31:46.821
Because I like you.

31:46.905 --> 31:47.905
I do...

31:47.990 --> 31:49.198
But I don't like

31:49.283 --> 31:50.866
how you say on the plane

31:50.951 --> 31:53.119
with your face
all scrunched up,

31:53.203 --> 31:55.413
"You're French, aren't you?"

31:55.497 --> 31:56.664
I don't like how you say

31:56.748 --> 31:58.207
with your eyes all squinty,

31:58.292 --> 32:00.376
"All men are bastards."

32:00.460 --> 32:01.586
Scrunched?

32:03.755 --> 32:05.131
Allons-y! Allons-y!

32:05.215 --> 32:06.549
Allez, allez!

32:12.973 --> 32:15.266
Please don't break
the car, OK.?

32:23.942 --> 32:26.611
OK, so I try to understand.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.780
He says he has met
this woman...

32:29.865 --> 32:31.616
no, no. This goddess.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.951
He breaks your heart.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.786
He...

32:35.871 --> 32:37.455
Hurts me.

32:37.539 --> 32:38.581
Humbles me.

32:38.665 --> 32:39.707
Humiliates you.

32:39.791 --> 32:40.791
Humiliates me.

32:40.876 --> 32:43.002
So you come here to Paris

32:43.086 --> 32:44.712
so he can do it again,

32:44.796 --> 32:46.881
but this time, in your face.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.132
No.

32:50.427 --> 32:51.469
Pardon.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.471
No, no. I come to Paris

32:53.555 --> 32:55.640
to get back the man
that I love.

32:55.724 --> 32:56.974
Is that so hard to understand,

32:57.059 --> 32:58.768
even for someone like yourself?

32:58.852 --> 33:01.228
OK, and meanwhile,
his lover is...

33:01.313 --> 33:03.731
Don't ever use that word again.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.232
This bastard woman,

33:05.317 --> 33:07.777
she is feeling something else,

33:07.861 --> 33:09.320
maybe...

33:09.404 --> 33:12.239
Once he saw me, myself, moi,

33:12.324 --> 33:14.575
everything would change.
The spell would be broken.

33:15.744 --> 33:18.412
What, you don't think
I could change his mind?

33:18.497 --> 33:20.790
I would remind him
we had a wonderful,

33:20.874 --> 33:21.999
perfect life together.

33:22.084 --> 33:23.125
Evidently.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.336
I've never been so happy.

33:25.420 --> 33:26.712
When someone says that,

33:26.797 --> 33:28.422
my ass begins to twitch.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.801
And we had plans
for a home and family.

33:31.885 --> 33:33.511
I'd remind him of that, too.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.888
He was obviously
very attached to them.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.556
If all else failed...

33:37.641 --> 33:40.226
You'd get down
on your knees and beg?

33:40.310 --> 33:41.519
It's possible.

33:41.603 --> 33:42.770
I can see it,

33:42.854 --> 33:44.980
there is the goddess
standing next to Charlie

33:45.065 --> 33:46.273
in her negligee,

33:46.358 --> 33:48.693
and you are on
your knees, begging.

33:48.777 --> 33:49.985
Poor Charlie.

33:50.070 --> 33:51.779
Tough decision.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.451
Alors!

33:58.995 --> 34:00.746
I didn't beg.

34:00.831 --> 34:02.498
No. You fainted.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.670
Hey, Luc-a-doo!

34:14.969 --> 34:19.098
I see how far you'd go
for the love of your life.

34:19.181 --> 34:20.891
If you know so much,

34:20.976 --> 34:23.393
how come no one greeted
you at the airport?

34:23.478 --> 34:25.730
Please. I'm finished
with women, OK.?

34:25.813 --> 34:27.398
Haven't found the right one?

34:27.482 --> 34:29.400
I have found plenty,
believe me.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.818
Afraid of commitment.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.194
I'm afraid of nothing.

34:32.279 --> 34:34.029
I know your problem,
no staying power.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.239
What?

34:35.322 --> 34:36.364
You can't stick it out.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.051
- What you talking about?
- It's obvious.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.243
It is?

34:39.327 --> 34:42.079
You are afraid of commitment.

34:42.164 --> 34:43.789
Commitment! Oh, OK., sorry.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.123
I thought you meant...

34:45.208 --> 34:46.292
What did you think?

34:46.376 --> 34:48.043
Nothing. It's OK.

34:48.128 --> 34:50.129
This problem.

34:50.213 --> 34:52.089
It's not a problem!

34:52.174 --> 34:53.424
For you, Luc?

34:53.507 --> 34:55.092
Every man goes through that.

34:55.177 --> 34:57.052
Charlie never did,
but, you know,

34:57.137 --> 34:59.013
it's usually an issue
of self-esteem.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.390
It's just a recent
phenomenon, OK.?

35:01.475 --> 35:03.893
I've been under a lot
of pressure recently.

35:03.977 --> 35:06.020
Soon it will all be over,

35:06.104 --> 35:08.731
and then zip, boom, bonjour,

35:08.815 --> 35:11.025
I'm back in business, OK.?

35:21.286 --> 35:22.536
Bob, great to see you.

35:22.871 --> 35:23.829
Hi, Luc.

35:23.914 --> 35:25.581
You've met my friend Kate?

35:25.874 --> 35:27.041
Hello again.

35:31.421 --> 35:32.463
Where's the rest?

35:32.547 --> 35:33.547
Hey!

35:39.095 --> 35:41.806
What about my money
and my passport?

35:43.850 --> 35:46.852
He sold the passport.
First thing to go.

35:46.937 --> 35:50.397
What about my suitcase

35:50.482 --> 35:51.649
and my clothes?

35:51.733 --> 35:53.025
Ask him about my vitamins.

35:54.444 --> 35:55.778
Her clothes?

35:56.530 --> 35:58.447
I gave them to Monique.

35:58.573 --> 35:59.657
Monique?

35:59.741 --> 36:01.826
What? What? What did he say?

36:01.910 --> 36:03.536
He threw them away.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.915
Oh, god!

36:07.999 --> 36:10.417
Oh, man!

36:12.671 --> 36:14.421
God!

36:15.799 --> 36:18.133
What? No. No, thank you.

36:20.387 --> 36:23.055
You got rid of everything?

36:28.562 --> 36:30.563
Except for that...

36:52.210 --> 36:54.378
You hid a plant in my bag?

36:54.462 --> 36:56.380
Not just a plant. A vine.

36:56.464 --> 36:57.585
That's why you're helping me.

36:57.591 --> 36:59.466
You don't give a shit about me.

36:59.593 --> 37:01.176
I'm sorry you lost your stuff,

37:01.261 --> 37:04.096
but it was not me who stole it.

37:04.180 --> 37:07.057
What if I had gotten
stopped at customs?

37:07.142 --> 37:08.559
What would've happened then?

37:08.643 --> 37:10.060
Don't be ridiculous.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.729
People like you
they don't stop.

37:11.813 --> 37:14.231
Why do you think I choose you?

37:14.316 --> 37:16.567
You'd declare a pack
of chewing gum.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.652
Please, don't ever, ever...

37:20.488 --> 37:22.156
Never touch my vine.

37:23.325 --> 37:24.909
You don't understand. This...

37:24.993 --> 37:26.994
This is my future.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.413
I'm going to make
a great vineyard,

37:29.497 --> 37:31.790
and I'm going to escape
this shit hole.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.793
You can't make a vineyard

37:34.878 --> 37:35.878
out of one vine.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.421
No. Not one vine.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.089
I take this little
American vine,

37:39.174 --> 37:41.091
I mix it with others,

37:41.176 --> 37:42.927
then I make something new.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.929
I don't care. I don't care.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.138
Why listen to you?

37:46.222 --> 37:47.431
It's bullshit.

37:47.515 --> 37:48.849
Everything with you
is bullshit.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.017
OK, fine.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.185
Go home.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.437
Find a nice little boy
you can boss around.

37:53.521 --> 37:56.440
Only don't let him
out of your sight.

37:56.524 --> 37:57.942
How do I do that?

37:58.026 --> 38:00.110
I have no money, no ticket,

38:00.195 --> 38:01.779
no passport...

38:01.863 --> 38:03.364
Here. Take this. Please.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.490
I don't want your money.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.784
It's what he got
for your stuff.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.911
I don't want your money.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.621
Now go away.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.706
Stop following me.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.417
OK.

38:15.502 --> 38:17.002
Bonne chance.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.767
What necklace?

39:13.935 --> 39:15.644
I didn't see any necklace!

39:15.854 --> 39:17.646
It must still be in her bag!

39:19.232 --> 39:20.649
In her bag?

39:59.773 --> 40:02.816
It's Wonderful... It's wonderful

40:02.901 --> 40:04.068
It's Wonderful

40:04.152 --> 40:06.028
Good Luck, My Baby

40:07.322 --> 40:09.865
It's Wonderful... It's wonderful

40:09.949 --> 40:13.744
I Dream Of You Chips, chips

40:42.941 --> 40:45.943
It's Wonderful... It's wonderful

40:46.027 --> 40:47.444
It's Wonderful

40:47.529 --> 40:49.238
Good Luck, My Baby

40:49.322 --> 40:51.990
It's Wonderful... It's wonderful

40:52.075 --> 40:53.283
It's Wonderful

40:53.368 --> 40:55.035
I Dream Of You

40:55.120 --> 40:57.287
Chips, Chips

41:01.501 --> 41:04.128
You are currently
a resident of Canada

41:04.212 --> 41:06.922
in the process of applying
for Canadian citizenship?

41:07.006 --> 41:09.258
My fiancé is Canadian.

41:09.342 --> 41:11.552
Let me ask you something.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.470
You no longer want
to be an American,

41:13.555 --> 41:14.596
but you expect me

41:14.681 --> 41:16.348
to give you a new passport?

41:17.684 --> 41:19.518
Is this a trick question?

41:19.602 --> 41:20.811
I'll need a copy

41:20.895 --> 41:22.146
of your Canadian resident visa

41:22.230 --> 41:24.648
before I can process
your application.

41:24.732 --> 41:25.732
Next.

41:38.580 --> 41:39.663
OK.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.123
How it works is,

41:41.207 --> 41:42.833
I ask you a question,

41:42.917 --> 41:44.418
and you comment.

41:46.045 --> 41:48.505
You weren't supposed
to leave Canada?

41:50.258 --> 41:51.633
Yeah, I know that,

41:51.718 --> 41:53.468
but an emergency
situation arose,

41:53.553 --> 41:55.470
and I needed to...

41:55.555 --> 41:57.389
What are you writing down?

41:57.473 --> 41:59.391
Why didn't you
request permission

41:59.475 --> 42:01.894
to leave for your emergency?

42:01.978 --> 42:04.062
Well, I should have, I realize.

42:04.147 --> 42:05.898
But an emergency,
by definition,

42:05.982 --> 42:07.941
doesn't give you the time.

42:08.026 --> 42:11.403
See, the thing is, sir,

42:11.487 --> 42:14.406
I want to be a Canadian
more than anything.

42:14.490 --> 42:17.409
I want to be just like you.

42:17.493 --> 42:18.619
Believe me.

42:18.703 --> 42:21.788
I just want to go home.

42:21.873 --> 42:22.956
What's that?

42:26.377 --> 42:27.669
OK.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.882
Have you...

42:31.966 --> 42:34.134
Ever been convicted...

42:34.219 --> 42:35.928
Of a felony?

42:39.891 --> 42:41.266
No.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.189
Yes.

42:47.273 --> 42:48.273
OK.

42:48.358 --> 42:50.817
OK, I was at
Ronny Templeton's house,

42:50.902 --> 42:52.402
and somebody handed me...

42:52.487 --> 42:53.862
All right,
it wasn't a cigarette,

42:53.947 --> 42:55.280
peer pressure.

42:55.365 --> 42:56.907
Peer pressure's
a terrible thing

42:56.991 --> 42:59.368
when you're a girl in college.

42:59.452 --> 43:01.870
Thing is, we just received this

43:01.955 --> 43:03.247
from a Sergeant Patton

43:03.331 --> 43:04.748
at the American Embassy.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.500
It says you were once convicted

43:06.584 --> 43:09.336
for possession of a narcotic.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.258
Is marijuana really a narcotic?

43:14.342 --> 43:16.760
I mean, it was
just the one time,

43:16.844 --> 43:18.762
and I didn't even enjoy it.

43:18.846 --> 43:21.431
I inhaled,
but then I was coughing

43:21.516 --> 43:23.267
and hacking away
for 10 minutes.

43:23.351 --> 43:24.726
I hate that.

43:25.520 --> 43:26.853
You do?

43:27.522 --> 43:28.939
Well, the point is

43:29.023 --> 43:31.525
is that you didn't
include this information

43:31.609 --> 43:33.944
in your application for
Canadian citizenship,

43:34.028 --> 43:35.779
paragraph 5, article 1?

43:37.448 --> 43:38.448
OK.

43:40.868 --> 43:42.286
Here's where I tell you

43:42.370 --> 43:44.037
that your request
for a new residence visa

43:44.122 --> 43:45.622
has been denied.

44:27.498 --> 44:28.540
Merci.

44:42.221 --> 44:44.306
Yeah. He proposed to her.

44:44.390 --> 44:45.807
He's such an asshole.

44:45.892 --> 44:47.768
I just can't believe it.

44:47.852 --> 44:50.312
Do I have to be friends
with Juliette?

44:50.396 --> 44:51.438
Lilly...

44:51.522 --> 44:53.940
Lilly, now, stop it, all right?

44:54.025 --> 44:55.400
He's not going to marry her.

44:55.485 --> 44:57.486
Now, tell me
everything you know.

44:57.570 --> 44:59.371
They're going somewhere
in the south of France

44:59.405 --> 45:00.489
to meet her parents,

45:00.573 --> 45:03.033
then they're getting married.

45:03.117 --> 45:05.911
We're not even invited.
Not that I'd go...

45:05.995 --> 45:07.954
Lilly, now, listen, OK?

45:08.039 --> 45:10.791
This is very important.
Very important.

45:10.875 --> 45:12.209
You have to tell me

45:12.293 --> 45:15.712
exactly where they're going
and when, all right?

45:15.797 --> 45:18.423
Now, just... just ask mom.

45:18.508 --> 45:20.884
She has it all
written down probably.

45:20.968 --> 45:22.344
OK.

45:22.428 --> 45:24.137
You still supposed
to call her mom?

45:24.222 --> 45:25.263
Lilly!

45:25.348 --> 45:26.640
OK.

45:26.724 --> 45:27.891
Mom!

45:29.811 --> 45:32.396
Kate? Is that you, sweetheart?

45:32.480 --> 45:35.357
I've got all the information
written down,

45:35.441 --> 45:37.150
but I think you can
still get him

45:37.235 --> 45:38.777
at the hotel in Paris.

45:40.655 --> 45:42.864
My god, she's crying.

45:42.949 --> 45:44.950
It's OK. I'm not crying.

45:45.034 --> 45:47.452
I'm just...

45:47.537 --> 45:50.747
I'm just...

45:50.832 --> 45:53.417
I'm going to get him back, mom.

45:53.501 --> 45:54.918
I'm going to get him back,

45:55.002 --> 45:56.670
and I'm going to
make him love me,

45:56.754 --> 45:59.423
and we're going to live
happily ever after.

46:00.466 --> 46:04.094
And I'm just crying now in...

46:04.178 --> 46:05.512
Happiness...

46:06.514 --> 46:09.099
Because I know...

46:09.183 --> 46:12.853
I know I will...

46:12.937 --> 46:14.688
I will triumph.

46:21.362 --> 46:22.946
What do they call the beaches?

46:24.157 --> 46:25.157
What does it mean?

46:25.241 --> 46:26.324
The blue coast.

46:26.409 --> 46:28.785
The blue coast,
lying there next to you.

46:28.870 --> 46:32.289
And we're going
to land in Nice.

46:32.373 --> 46:33.331
Nice?

46:33.416 --> 46:34.416
Yes.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.459
That's nice.

46:35.543 --> 46:36.585
Sweet.

47:02.945 --> 47:05.614
Bob, you know how it works.

47:06.532 --> 47:09.576
If the little fish is to survive,
he must tell the fisherman...

47:09.660 --> 47:11.578
where the big fish are.

47:11.913 --> 47:14.164
Forget it, I'm no rat.

47:16.542 --> 47:20.212
You're mixing your metaphors.

47:20.421 --> 47:22.172
Who buys the passports?

47:28.930 --> 47:31.306
Hi there.

47:31.390 --> 47:33.475
Welcome back, madame,
to the George V.

47:35.436 --> 47:37.020
It's incredible
how you do that.

47:37.104 --> 47:39.022
The words come out
"welcome back,"

47:39.106 --> 47:41.441
but the meaning is
completely different.

47:41.526 --> 47:44.486
Is that a French thing
or a concierge thing?

47:44.570 --> 47:45.904
As madame wishes.

47:45.988 --> 47:48.448
You did it again.

47:49.116 --> 47:50.200
Tell me something,

47:50.284 --> 47:51.868
because I... I just don't get it.

47:51.953 --> 47:53.662
Do you enjoy being that rude?

47:53.746 --> 47:56.248
Because when you do that,

47:56.332 --> 47:58.291
it just gets
underneath my skin,

47:58.376 --> 48:00.460
and it makes me

48:00.545 --> 48:02.921
completely insane!

48:08.427 --> 48:10.387
Thank you, madame, for
the fascinating lesson

48:10.471 --> 48:11.972
in our cultural differences.

48:12.056 --> 48:14.641
I'm sure it would not
betray my duty now

48:14.725 --> 48:17.394
to inform you that your
fiancé and his friend

48:17.478 --> 48:20.105
are no longer our guests.

48:20.982 --> 48:22.816
Well, whose guests
would they be now?

48:26.487 --> 48:28.822
The Carlton Hotel will have
that happy privilege

48:28.906 --> 48:30.490
when they arrive
in Cannes tomorrow.

48:30.575 --> 48:33.785
Perhaps madame wishes to
catch the last train tonight.

48:33.869 --> 48:35.787
I could arrange for
a taxi very quickly.

48:35.871 --> 48:37.205
Yes, thank you.

48:54.724 --> 48:56.308
Bob, I'm losing patience.

49:02.106 --> 49:04.482
A big fish just returned
from the United States.

49:06.652 --> 49:08.820
Luc Teyssier... your friend, right?

49:11.699 --> 49:14.117
Ask him about a stolen necklace.

49:14.410 --> 49:15.702
He won't be hard to find.

49:15.786 --> 49:17.245
Take a look.

49:20.416 --> 49:21.708
You're welcome.

49:27.590 --> 49:28.673
Allons-y!

50:05.127 --> 50:08.088
I come to make peace
with your people.

50:09.965 --> 50:12.509
So you're still after Charlie?

50:12.593 --> 50:13.593
It is incredible.

50:13.678 --> 50:16.513
I admire your persistence.
It's so American.

50:16.597 --> 50:18.264
I am not an American.

50:18.349 --> 50:21.267
I'm a soon-to-be
ex-American Canadian.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.436
May I help you with your bag?

50:23.521 --> 50:24.938
No, maybe not.

50:25.272 --> 50:28.566
I am feeling some very
strange emotions for me.

50:28.651 --> 50:30.276
Guilt. Remorse.

50:30.361 --> 50:32.570
My self-esteem is rock bottom.

50:32.655 --> 50:35.115
What can I do to say I'm sorry?

50:35.199 --> 50:36.408
Shut up!

50:36.492 --> 50:38.410
You haven't spent
60 seconds with me

50:38.494 --> 50:39.774
when you weren't
after something.

50:39.787 --> 50:41.871
What's it this time,
buy, sell, or trade?

50:41.956 --> 50:44.541
True, I used you a lot.

50:44.625 --> 50:46.042
You helped me to get my vine,

50:46.127 --> 50:48.378
and I left you with nothing.

50:48.462 --> 50:51.339
What can I do to
make it up to you?

50:51.424 --> 50:53.425
Now I'm here for you.

50:57.304 --> 50:58.972
Typical.

51:05.896 --> 51:07.188
Who put this here?

52:47.790 --> 52:49.916
So I asked myself
what I can possibly do

52:50.000 --> 52:51.167
to make it up to you,

52:51.252 --> 52:52.669
so I buy this ticket,

52:52.753 --> 52:53.837
and voila, here I am...

52:53.921 --> 52:56.756
Quiet.

53:13.774 --> 53:16.317
You come, you go,

53:16.402 --> 53:18.319
you promise one thing,
you do something else.

53:18.404 --> 53:20.363
Why should I believe you?

53:20.447 --> 53:22.532
Because I have
no reason to lie now.

53:22.616 --> 53:24.033
Do I look like the kind...

53:24.118 --> 53:25.451
You look like the kind

53:25.536 --> 53:28.371
who steals airplane
liquor bottles,

53:28.455 --> 53:30.790
who offers a girl a ride,
then has to steal a car

53:30.875 --> 53:32.125
in order to give it to her,

53:32.209 --> 53:36.379
the kind who puts a plant
in a person's bag.

53:36.463 --> 53:38.423
This is a no-smoking
compartment.

53:39.341 --> 53:41.718
OK, I stop. Voila. For you.

53:41.802 --> 53:43.303
See, I'm changing, I'm growing.

53:43.387 --> 53:44.554
We help each other.

53:44.638 --> 53:46.472
I don't need your help.

53:46.557 --> 53:50.101
Do you have a plan for
when you see Charlie?

53:50.185 --> 53:51.269
Still no?

53:51.353 --> 53:52.520
You're going into a battle,

53:52.605 --> 53:55.106
you have no strategy,
no armor, no bullshit?

53:55.232 --> 53:57.650
I don't need bullshit
to get Charlie back.

53:57.735 --> 54:00.153
Just a little.
It might be handy.

54:00.237 --> 54:02.155
For me, bullshit
is like breathing.

54:02.239 --> 54:05.450
I stay. I help you.
I promise, OK.?

54:05.534 --> 54:07.368
Do what you want.
It's a free country.

54:07.453 --> 54:08.536
Isn't it?

54:08.621 --> 54:10.747
Well, oui.

54:18.464 --> 54:19.464
Is... is that Charlie?

54:20.633 --> 54:22.133
Can I...

54:27.848 --> 54:29.641
How did you meet?

54:29.725 --> 54:31.059
At a party.

54:31.143 --> 54:33.186
I'd just come to Toronto
on a teaching exchange.

54:33.270 --> 54:34.646
We started talking,

54:34.730 --> 54:37.148
and I had this
feeling about him.

54:37.232 --> 54:39.150
It wasn't exactly a thunderclap

54:39.234 --> 54:41.736
or a lightning bolt.
It was more like a...

54:41.820 --> 54:43.237
Light drizzle?

54:44.198 --> 54:45.448
You really, honestly,

54:45.532 --> 54:46.783
never had that feeling
about anybody

54:46.867 --> 54:48.201
in your whole entire life?

54:48.285 --> 54:50.703
If I did, I would not admit it.

54:50.788 --> 54:53.706
His chin looks a little
weak, if you ask me.

54:53.791 --> 54:54.916
It doesn't, and I didn't.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.584
Why wouldn't you
admit that feeling?

54:56.669 --> 54:58.628
Why? Look where it's got you.

54:58.712 --> 54:59.837
Maybe if you did,

54:59.922 --> 55:02.966
you wouldn't have
that little problem.

55:03.050 --> 55:05.927
It's not a problem.
It's just a temporary...

55:06.887 --> 55:08.721
There's something in his eyes.

55:08.806 --> 55:10.431
Vain, it is a word, no?

55:10.516 --> 55:12.475
It is a word.
He has beautiful eyes.

55:12.559 --> 55:13.935
And he knows it.

55:14.019 --> 55:15.395
You can see it in his smile.

55:15.479 --> 55:18.690
Not even a smile.
A smirk. Is a word?

55:18.774 --> 55:21.484
Shut up. Is it a word?

55:21.568 --> 55:23.319
Two words, no?

55:23.404 --> 55:24.737
Why are you chasing after him

55:24.822 --> 55:25.947
after what he's done?

55:26.031 --> 55:27.198
Because I love him,

55:27.282 --> 55:29.742
and I'm afraid if he
doesn't come back

55:29.827 --> 55:32.662
that I'll... It'll hurt so much

55:32.746 --> 55:33.955
that I'll shrivel up

55:34.039 --> 55:36.499
and never be able
to love ever again.

55:36.583 --> 55:37.959
You say that now,

55:38.043 --> 55:42.005
but after a time,
you would forget.

55:42.089 --> 55:44.215
First, you would
forget his chin,

55:44.299 --> 55:46.175
and then his nose,

55:46.260 --> 55:48.344
and after a while,
you would struggle

55:48.429 --> 55:50.888
to remember the exact
color of his eyes.

55:50.973 --> 55:53.850
One day you wake up,
and... he's gone,

55:53.934 --> 55:57.478
his voice, his smell,
his face...

55:57.563 --> 55:59.272
He will have left you.

55:59.356 --> 56:01.899
And then you can begin again.

57:22.106 --> 57:23.523
Charlie?

58:48.442 --> 58:49.775
Hey!

58:49.860 --> 58:52.361
I can't seem to get
enough of this cheese,

58:52.446 --> 58:55.239
and I haven't eaten
this stuff in years.

58:55.324 --> 58:57.450
You don't look like
you got much sleep.

58:57.534 --> 58:58.618
Un café.

58:59.912 --> 59:00.995
For some reason,

59:01.079 --> 59:02.830
I just feel
incredibly refreshed.

59:02.915 --> 59:05.541
I had this dream, which
I can't remember really.

59:05.626 --> 59:07.710
You know when you have a dream

59:07.794 --> 59:09.212
that is just delicious

59:09.296 --> 59:10.296
and you wake up

59:10.380 --> 59:13.049
and you feel all transformed?

59:14.259 --> 59:16.510
God, it's beautiful here.

59:17.596 --> 59:19.180
Merci.

59:20.933 --> 59:22.141
Did you know

59:22.226 --> 59:24.101
that there are 452
official government cheeses

59:24.186 --> 59:25.228
in this country?

59:25.312 --> 59:26.979
Don't you think
that's incredible,

59:27.064 --> 59:29.523
to come up with 452 ways
of classifying

59:29.608 --> 59:32.443
what is basically
a bacterial process?

59:32.527 --> 59:33.861
You would prefer one cheese,

59:33.946 --> 59:35.404
one cheeseburger to put it on,

59:35.489 --> 59:37.073
and one restaurant
to eat it in?

59:37.157 --> 59:39.617
I'm saying I like the cheese.

59:41.036 --> 59:42.411
God!

59:42.496 --> 59:45.164
What side of the train
did you wake up on?

59:46.083 --> 59:48.584
God, it's beautiful here!

59:51.630 --> 59:53.047
What? What's that face?

59:53.131 --> 59:54.882
You don't think it's beautiful?

59:54.967 --> 59:57.426
You don't think
this is beautiful?

59:59.846 --> 01:00:00.888
What?

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.683
I was born here.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.686
Really?

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:10.439
But this is so beautiful
and so charming.

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:13.609
It was too beautiful for me,

01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:15.111
I had to leave.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.122
Oh, god.

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.707
Oh, god!

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:29.959
What?

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:31.460
I'm going to die.

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:32.962
What, what, the cheese?

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:36.799
Don't say it.
Stop that rocking.

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:38.092
Stop the rocking.

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:40.094
I can't. It is the train.

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:42.096
It's here.

01:00:43.223 --> 01:00:44.640
The mucus is here.

01:00:44.725 --> 01:00:45.725
The mucus?

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:49.812
The mucus coating
the intestinal wall.

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:51.981
Spasm!

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.317
No, no, no.

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:56.319
Look at the scenery,
the cows...

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.362
Oh, please, not the cows.

01:00:58.447 --> 01:00:59.530
Not the cows?

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:01.657
I just ate that cow.

01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:03.034
There it is.

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:05.411
Here we go.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:06.579
Lactose...

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:09.290
Intolerance!

01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:20.968
Jacques Taranne?

01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:22.511
Non.

01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:25.139
I know you...

01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:26.807
Phillipe Cazal?

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:28.434
Non.

01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:32.480
Michel Desbordes?

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:35.232
Listen, gramps, you don't know me.

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:36.400
Leave me alone, OK?

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.577
You are feeling better now?

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:47.703
Better.

01:01:47.788 --> 01:01:49.372
The cow is all gone?

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:50.790
When's the next train?

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:52.041
Not for two more hours.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.292
Good.

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:57.463
I think I need to walk.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.465
No, no, no. Bad idea.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.509
Sit. We wait for the train.

01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:03.010
Got to walk.

01:02:03.095 --> 01:02:04.345
But...

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:13.896
Luc Teyssier! That's it!

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.530
My stomach is so sensitive.

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:24.824
That's where
I put all my stress.

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.243
Beautiful!

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:29.495
Gorgeous. Wish you were here.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:32.415
How long since
you've been back?

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:34.458
About six years.

01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:37.586
Six years? Is your family
a nightmare or something?

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:40.005
I don't really want
to talk about it, OK.?

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.465
A healthy person is someone

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:43.759
who expresses what
they're feeling inside.

01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:45.511
Express, not repress.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.055
You must be one of
the healthiest people

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.974
in the world.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:53.352
You know what happens to people

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:54.520
who shut everybody out?

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.605
They lead
quiet, peaceful lives?

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:59.442
No, they fester.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:00.651
Fester?

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.069
I am festering?

01:03:02.154 --> 01:03:03.404
Inside.

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:04.905
Fester and rot.

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:06.365
I've seen it happen.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.533
You'll become one of those

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:10.119
hunchbacked, lonely old men

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:12.329
sitting in the corner
of a crowded cafe

01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:14.540
mumbling to yourself.

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.542
My ass is twitching.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:19.211
You people make my ass twitch.

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:28.762
Excuse me.

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:31.849
Hey!

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:32.933
Attends, attends.

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:33.976
Attends quoi?

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.060
Attends.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:36.228
Attends!

01:03:49.034 --> 01:03:50.075
Wait.

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:53.078
Who is that?

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:55.206
It's my brother.

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:56.373
Your brother?

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:57.458
My brother Antoine.

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:58.876
Antoine, this is Kate.

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:03.422
What's happening?

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:07.176
All of this vineyard
is Antoine's.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:10.888
It has been in our family
for three generations.

01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:12.723
It is who we are, what we do.

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:14.391
But for Antoine, I don't know,

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:15.976
he is always sober.

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:17.728
That's a bad thing?

01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:19.855
He makes the wine
but never drinks it.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.440
You always drink it.

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:25.569
Now, why isn't
part of this yours?

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.241
My father when he retired,

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:33.410
he left it to Antoine and me.

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:36.121
But now it is all Antoine's.

01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:38.374
I don't get it.

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:41.544
To make a great wine,

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:44.463
you must have
the soul of a gambler.

01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:47.550
You like to drink,
and you like to gamble.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:50.261
Sometimes I would lose a lot.

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:51.554
Sometimes I would
lose to Antoine...

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.472
My dog, my first car.

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:54.557
This vineyard.

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:57.017
Oui, this vineyard...

01:04:57.769 --> 01:04:59.270
It was... One night,

01:04:59.354 --> 01:05:02.022
he got me very drunk.

01:05:02.107 --> 01:05:04.650
You must understand,
I owed him a lot of money.

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.235
He knew what he was doing.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.654
What was he doing?

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.573
I lost all of it,

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:12.074
one hand of poker.

01:05:14.995 --> 01:05:17.788
You lost your birthright
in one hand of poker?

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:20.708
I'm an asshole.
What can I tell you?

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:26.338
So that's why he hates you

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:27.590
and you hate him.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.801
That, and I...

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:33.178
slept with his wife.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:38.434
What about your parents

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:39.810
and the rest of your family?

01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:43.314
No, there is
nothing between us.

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:44.940
It is all over, finished.

01:05:45.025 --> 01:05:46.525
What if you tried again?

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.402
No, it's not possible.

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:51.780
They hate me,
they despise me, they...

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:53.282
Luc revient!

01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:57.161
Papa.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.121
Papa?

01:06:21.936 --> 01:06:24.313
Yes, thank you.
All right, come on.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:27.691
I'm very impressed.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:32.237
She's a friend, just a friend.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.242
Since when are women
just your friends?

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:39.453
Since I met her.

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:27.626
I'm finished.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:47.980
Fester, fester, fester.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:50.983
Rot, rot, rot.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:53.944
Poor you.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:57.072
You had to grow up here.

01:07:57.157 --> 01:07:58.657
Show me your room.

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:12.171
What's this?

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:15.257
It is a project

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:17.176
I did a long time
ago in school.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.386
What is it?

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:22.805
All right, I will
tell you, but...

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:26.185
First you must take some wine.

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:31.939
Can you...

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:34.276
describe it, the taste?

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:36.069
It's a nice red wine.

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.573
I think you can do better.

01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:43.618
A bold wine with
a hint of sophistication

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:46.246
and lacking in pretension.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:50.876
Actually, I was just
talking about myself.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.504
I... I don't know.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.087
No, no, you are not wrong.

01:08:55.173 --> 01:08:57.633
Wine is like people.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.635
The vine takes
all the influences

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:01.220
in life all around it.

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:02.513
It absorbs them,

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:05.640
and it gets its personality.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:06.725
Here.

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.647
Smell.

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:12.773
Rosemary.

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:20.279
Some kind of mushroom?

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:23.325
Very good.

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:26.245
Currant, cassis, mint,

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:29.331
lavender,

01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:30.666
they're all in the ground here

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:31.917
and in the air.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.586
Now, taste the wine again.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.509
Close your eyes.

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:49.350
The currant...

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:52.062
I can taste that
right away, and...

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:54.940
from the brown bottle,
lavender?

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.151
Incredible.

01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:00.863
And you made this box?

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:06.034
Incredible.

01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:15.460
Thanks.

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:49.953
Whose house is that?

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:53.707
It's abandoned.

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.083
No one comes here anymore.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.249
The guy who had this place,

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:58.712
he gave up a long time ago.

01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:00.547
Look.

01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:06.637
See this earth?

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:08.388
It's been resting.

01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:10.140
Now it's good.

01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:13.226
Someday, I...

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:14.351
I'm going to buy this land.

01:11:14.354 --> 01:11:16.647
I'm going to make a great wine,

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:19.650
right here on this
wreck of a vineyard.

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:24.988
So you'd risk
everything for this?

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:27.240
Do anything to have it?

01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:31.161
Get down on your knees and beg?

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:38.627
Then what makes you
so different from me?

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:40.587
Admit it.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.381
Not much.

01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:45.467
OK, I admit.

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:48.887
OK.

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:56.603
It's beautiful here.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:07.781
I will help you
get your Charlie back.

01:12:07.865 --> 01:12:09.116
If you want him back,

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.743
we'll get him back,
like I promised.

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:20.585
Papa!

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:23.088
Luc!

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.643
Tell me something, Luc,

01:12:36.728 --> 01:12:38.270
how do you plan
to buy that vineyard?

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.689
You must have a plan,
some strategy.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:45.694
I had a plan,
but it did not work out.

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:46.778
It didn't work out?

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.196
What was the plan?

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:52.242
I had something to sell.

01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:54.703
Something? Like what?

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:56.288
Stocks, bonds,

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:58.165
a little bag of plutonium?

01:12:58.249 --> 01:13:00.250
It doesn't matter. I lost it.

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:02.461
You lost it?

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:03.670
If it was me,

01:13:03.755 --> 01:13:05.338
I'd have some kind
of backup plan,

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:06.548
something more than just

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:08.717
bullshit to fall back on.

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:11.303
Something, perhaps,
maybe a little bit...

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:13.138
Like this?

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.520
Luc,

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:21.813
are you coming?

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:32.032
Lesson number one,

01:13:32.617 --> 01:13:34.201
before going into a war,

01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:37.329
you must choose carefully
the field of battle.

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:41.333
Also, never let Charlie see
how much you desire him.

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.835
Never tell someone
that you want them.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:44.920
You see that?

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:46.338
What's that, that pout?

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.799
Juliette did that. I
remember that perfectly.

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:52.010
The pout is the French
women's greatest weapon.

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:53.428
What's so great about that?

01:13:53.513 --> 01:13:54.763
It's provocative.

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:55.889
It puts the man

01:13:55.973 --> 01:13:58.600
in a constant state of
excitement and anxiety.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:00.727
She can say "yes"
when she means "no"

01:14:00.812 --> 01:14:02.896
And vice versa.
Do you understand?

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:03.980
No.

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:05.190
You don't?

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:07.234
Gotcha.

01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:09.694
Now, most important,

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.321
when Charlie sees you,

01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:14.991
he will be expecting
a big scene, a drama.

01:14:15.076 --> 01:14:17.661
You will not give him
the satisfaction.

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:20.122
This will make him
immediately intrigued.

01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:21.289
Luc, Luc.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:22.332
What?

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:23.458
Look what I found.

01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:25.669
It made me think of you.

01:14:38.558 --> 01:14:40.559
M. Antoinne Teyssier.

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:44.980
How will you be paying, sir?

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:04.374
When would you like
to have the wedding?

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:05.584
Next weekend.

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:06.710
Next weekend?

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:52.088
Is there something
wrong, Charlie?

01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:54.216
No. No, I...

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.052
I swear I just saw Kate.

01:15:57.136 --> 01:15:59.471
I'm sure it's just
your imagination.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:10.232
Tell me,

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:11.650
what does your father do?

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:13.193
Well, he's a doctor...

01:16:13.277 --> 01:16:14.236
Like me.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.571
Except he's a psychiatrist.

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:27.874
I'll be right back.

01:16:27.959 --> 01:16:29.459
Please, Charlie, sit down.

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:54.943
Pardon.

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:04.369
My parents are watching.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:05.620
I'm sure I just saw Kate.

01:17:07.999 --> 01:17:09.916
Come with me now.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:19.884
You really don't understand me.

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:21.011
How can I help you

01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:22.804
win back this ridiculous man

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.848
if you act like a clown?

01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:26.391
It was an accident, OK.?

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:29.352
I wasn't expecting
to see him right then.

01:17:29.437 --> 01:17:31.479
Sucking up to her parents...

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:33.356
In that outfit.

01:17:33.441 --> 01:17:36.568
And did you see her?

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:37.736
Cutting her food

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.238
into tiny, little
chewable pieces like that.

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:41.364
I saw her.

01:17:41.449 --> 01:17:42.907
She was...

01:17:43.951 --> 01:17:45.201
She was what?

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:46.619
Well, she was...

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:49.122
OK, I know what you're saying.

01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:50.582
I'm not sexy enough.

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:52.000
No, I did not say anything.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:53.835
I'm supposed to be
this pouty little girl

01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:57.380
who says "yes" for "no"
and "no" for "yes."

01:17:57.465 --> 01:17:59.090
I cannot do it, OK.?

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:01.926
Happy, smile. Sad, frown.

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.470
Use the corresponding face

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:04.596
for the corresponding emotion.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:05.722
But you?

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:07.515
No, you want a mysterious,

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.517
sexy, manipulative...

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:11.644
It is not me. I don't want it.

01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:12.729
What do you want?

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:14.314
I want you!

01:18:14.398 --> 01:18:16.232
I want you...

01:18:16.317 --> 01:18:17.817
You want me...

01:18:20.237 --> 01:18:22.364
I want you to...

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:25.742
Make Charlie suffer...

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:29.120
To be tempted.

01:18:30.498 --> 01:18:33.375
I want you to make him
feel like

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:37.837
even though you are
right there in front of him,

01:18:37.922 --> 01:18:39.589
he can't have you.

01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:43.843
That's all.

01:20:18.022 --> 01:20:19.355
Luc?

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:28.573
Do you...

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:34.162
Do you think I still have
a chance with Charlie

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:35.997
after what happened earlier?

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:39.584
Yes, of course.

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:42.128
And tomorrow...

01:20:42.213 --> 01:20:45.256
we will turn your mistake
to our advantage.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:46.591
We will?

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:49.594
Because he will still be wondering,

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.054
did he see you?

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:54.265
You will be
like a ghost, a phantom.

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:56.601
And it will infect them,

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:57.936
their rapport.

01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:00.522
Well, when do I confront him?

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:02.398
Just when they are

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:04.943
starting to look
comfortable again.

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:08.029
Then you attack.

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.948
- Hi.
- Kate!

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:11.533
Hi.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:15.954
Oh, can I sit with you guys?

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:18.039
But of course.
Please have a seat.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:25.463
Pay no attention to me.

01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:26.881
So...

01:21:26.966 --> 01:21:28.925
You must be Juliette.

01:21:29.009 --> 01:21:30.051
Yes, I'm Juliette.

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:31.177
Let me take a good look

01:21:31.262 --> 01:21:33.346
at the woman who stole
my Charlie's heart.

01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:37.183
Nothing that did not
want to be stolen.

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:41.479
She's smart, Charlie.

01:21:42.106 --> 01:21:43.106
And beautiful

01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:44.470
and probably great
at everything.

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:45.441
Look, Kate...

01:21:45.526 --> 01:21:46.568
Charlie, relax.

01:21:46.652 --> 01:21:48.194
I didn't come here for a fight.

01:21:48.279 --> 01:21:49.237
Hello, waiter.

01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:50.446
- Madame.
- Hi.

01:21:50.531 --> 01:21:52.407
I don't speak much French.

01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:54.242
A sea breeze.
Does that translate?

01:21:56.453 --> 01:21:57.453
French waiters, if you're nice,

01:21:57.538 --> 01:21:59.789
they treat you like shit.

01:21:59.873 --> 01:22:01.499
Treat them like shit,
they love you.

01:22:08.132 --> 01:22:09.382
Merci.

01:22:09.466 --> 01:22:10.508
What?

01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:12.969
Nothing. You just
seem so different.

01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:15.930
Well, Charlie...

01:22:16.015 --> 01:22:18.600
I'm going through some sort
of transitional thing.

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:22.228
After you called,
I decided to get to Paris

01:22:22.313 --> 01:22:23.396
and get you back.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.858
I hate to fly. Never fly,
right, Charlie?

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.443
But I told myself

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.903
no way would everything
I've been building toward

01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:32.780
be destroyed because
some pouty little...

01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:34.532
And this is before
I knew you personally.

01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:37.493
Bitch wanted to steal
herself a husband.

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:39.787
So I bought the ticket,
boarded the plane,

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:42.290
somehow made it over the ocean,

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:45.043
and then the most
extraordinary thing happened.

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:46.336
What?

01:22:47.421 --> 01:22:49.047
Everything went wrong.

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:53.176
So I was wandering
the streets of Paris,

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.970
penniless, without
a hope in the world.

01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:57.305
And, let me tell you,

01:22:57.389 --> 01:22:58.556
you can do a lot
of soul-searching

01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:00.016
in a time like that.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.102
I realized that I've spent
most of my adult life

01:23:03.187 --> 01:23:06.522
trying to protect myself
from exactly this situation.

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:08.191
You can't do it.

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:10.109
There's no home safe enough,

01:23:10.194 --> 01:23:12.820
no relationship secure enough.

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:15.615
You're just setting yourself up
for an even bigger fall

01:23:15.699 --> 01:23:18.493
and having an incredibly
boring time in the process.

01:23:18.577 --> 01:23:19.786
Sorry, Charlie.

01:23:20.954 --> 01:23:22.121
Thank you.

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:27.293
That's when I took up with Luc.

01:23:27.378 --> 01:23:29.253
Luke?

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:30.880
Luc.

01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:34.467
There he is.

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:36.135
Luc! Come on over.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.429
I want you to meet
some great people.

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:44.102
Luc, the lovely Juliette.

01:23:44.395 --> 01:23:45.436
Enchantée.

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:46.521
Enchanté.

01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:48.022
Charlie, Luc.

01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:49.273
Enchanté.

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.026
Sweetie pie...

01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:02.745
What did he just say?

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.205
I don't know.

01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:05.832
He doesn't speak much English,

01:24:05.916 --> 01:24:07.875
but we seem to manage
just fine.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.335
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:11.838
I think it's that
transitional thing,

01:24:11.922 --> 01:24:13.548
to help me get over us.

01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:16.551
That's probably it,
but... What the hell?

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:19.470
I love the sea, so beautiful...

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:21.431
so mysterious...

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:22.724
so...

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:26.018
full of fish.

01:24:27.271 --> 01:24:29.355
What does he do?

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.941
Besides what we do together?

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:34.819
I don't think he does
anything at all.

01:24:43.871 --> 01:24:46.789
That was so great!

01:24:46.874 --> 01:24:48.124
Hi there.

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:49.292
You were fantastic...

01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:50.460
Incredible.

01:24:50.544 --> 01:24:51.794
They were completely destroyed.

01:24:51.879 --> 01:24:53.629
Oh, that was amazing!

01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:55.923
I just feel released!

01:24:56.008 --> 01:24:57.216
Now, tonight,

01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:59.635
you will have dinner
with Charlie,

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.095
pretending to...

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:03.598
Work out the details
of the breakup.

01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:05.391
By tomorrow, I promise you,

01:25:05.476 --> 01:25:07.560
you will be queen
of the castle again.

01:25:07.644 --> 01:25:08.686
We must celebrate.

01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:10.146
Some wine, champagne.

01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:12.565
Don't move.

01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:13.733
OK.

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:25.495
A beautiful day
to be in Cannes...

01:25:25.579 --> 01:25:27.079
Isn't it, Kate?

01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:30.625
I'm sorry. Do we
know each other?

01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:32.960
No, but we have
a mutual acquaintance,

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:34.712
Luc Teyssier.

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:38.216
That's why I come talk to you

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:40.218
about a necklace.

01:25:45.933 --> 01:25:47.975
The necklace.

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:50.353
He was silly, and
he didn't declare it.

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:51.646
Will it be a large penalty

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:52.897
he'll have to pay?

01:26:00.864 --> 01:26:02.406
So why don't you
just arrest him?

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:06.327
I'm old-fashioned.
I owe him a large debt

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:08.621
much bigger than
the debt of money.

01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:10.039
So I ask you to talk to him.

01:26:10.123 --> 01:26:13.251
It can be returned to me
tomorrow, anonymously.

01:26:14.253 --> 01:26:15.545
He'll never agree.

01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:17.046
He must.

01:26:18.465 --> 01:26:19.882
Call me tomorrow.

01:26:21.718 --> 01:26:23.135
It really is a beautiful day.

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.763
I hope you're able to enjoy it.

01:26:36.817 --> 01:26:39.861
This is where I will sell
my necklace tomorrow.

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:41.112
Your necklace.

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:42.655
My necklace.

01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:44.949
It was my
grandmother's necklace.

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:46.325
She lived in San Francisco.

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:49.287
When she died,
she left it to me.

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:50.872
OK, sure. Why not?

01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:52.915
Luc?

01:26:54.126 --> 01:26:55.626
What if I sell the necklace?

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:57.712
You? What do you mean? Why?

01:26:57.796 --> 01:27:00.715
Why? Because I am me,
and you are...

01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:01.924
You.

01:27:02.009 --> 01:27:04.218
I mean, if I go into Cartier...

01:27:04.303 --> 01:27:07.054
All dressed up,
looking just so,

01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:08.389
smiling your little smile,

01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:09.974
walking your little walk.

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:11.142
That would be better.

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:12.310
Thank you.

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:14.729
What do you mean,
my little walk?

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:16.731
Oh, just the way
you walk, you know?

01:27:16.815 --> 01:27:19.483
It's like a woman
and a little girl.

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:21.068
No, it's not.

01:27:29.328 --> 01:27:31.621
You want something to drink?

01:27:31.705 --> 01:27:34.332
OK, Great. I'll be out
in a second.

01:27:51.725 --> 01:27:53.601
Bought it at the store
downstairs.

01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:56.312
You look wonderful.

01:27:57.481 --> 01:27:58.564
Was it expensive?

01:27:58.649 --> 01:27:59.607
Yeah.

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:01.108
You charged it to the room?

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:04.612
Good. No problem.

01:28:04.696 --> 01:28:06.781
I only wish my brother
could see you.

01:28:07.574 --> 01:28:09.158
It only needs one thing.

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:12.954
You will wear this tonight.

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:14.830
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

01:28:14.915 --> 01:28:16.332
Oh, no, I insist.

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:18.000
It will be your charm...

01:28:18.085 --> 01:28:19.585
Your good luck charm.

01:28:30.847 --> 01:28:32.473
Who is the goddess now?

01:28:34.226 --> 01:28:35.434
Now...

01:28:35.519 --> 01:28:36.727
We practice.

01:28:36.812 --> 01:28:38.229
I will be Charlie.

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:42.942
I'll be Kate.

01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:47.405
So we are dancing.

01:28:47.489 --> 01:28:49.073
I realize how much I need you.

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:50.992
I am thinking, I am an idiot,

01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:53.244
a fool, a chinless, mindless...

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:55.830
OK, OK, I get the idea.

01:28:55.914 --> 01:28:57.498
OK, So we are dancing.

01:28:58.875 --> 01:28:59.959
It feels...

01:29:00.043 --> 01:29:01.711
So right.

01:29:01.795 --> 01:29:04.338
Now, what do you say to me?

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:08.676
I don't know anymore.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.011
You don't?

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:13.431
I don't know when
to stop pretending.

01:29:13.515 --> 01:29:16.934
I mean, when do I
tell him that...

01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:19.854
That you love only him...

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:22.523
And still you want him.

01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:24.608
You will know the moment.

01:29:26.153 --> 01:29:28.904
You will tell him,
and that will be that.

01:29:30.449 --> 01:29:32.116
You know what I am
going to do for you

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:34.118
to ensure victory?

01:29:34.244 --> 01:29:35.828
What's that?

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:37.038
Juliette.

01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:41.375
Juliette?

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.627
She will be feeling
a little sad tonight...

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:45.755
A little angry...

01:29:45.839 --> 01:29:47.590
A little vulnerable.

01:29:48.675 --> 01:29:50.593
I will find her, and I will...

01:29:50.677 --> 01:29:51.969
Comfort her.

01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:54.680
Well, I wouldn't want you

01:29:54.765 --> 01:29:57.141
to do anything too unpleasant.

01:29:58.477 --> 01:29:59.560
I do it for you.

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:01.270
Well, what about your little...

01:30:01.354 --> 01:30:02.730
My little problem

01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:04.398
will not be such
a problem tonight.

01:30:04.483 --> 01:30:05.733
Suddenly, I'm feeling

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:08.611
like you, relaxed.

01:30:08.695 --> 01:30:10.071
I will go to her.

01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:12.406
I will find her
and talk to her...

01:30:17.204 --> 01:30:18.704
Let's just dance.

01:30:36.389 --> 01:30:37.640
I keep the bonsai.

01:30:37.724 --> 01:30:40.309
The lamp we got
in New York is yours.

01:30:40.393 --> 01:30:42.269
The living room love seat...

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:44.271
Tell me if you
think this is crazy.

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:47.024
Right down the middle
with a chain saw!

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:48.150
Make two chairs.

01:30:48.235 --> 01:30:49.318
Can we not talk about this?

01:30:49.402 --> 01:30:51.445
It's depressing, isn't it?

01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:52.822
It's business,

01:30:52.906 --> 01:30:54.949
the business of breaking up.

01:30:55.033 --> 01:30:56.325
If you can't handle it,

01:30:56.409 --> 01:30:59.203
I can sell everything and
send you half the cash.

01:30:59.287 --> 01:31:00.371
You must hate me.

01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:03.082
I don't. The CDs
will be tough, though.

01:31:03.166 --> 01:31:04.708
Why don't you just
let me have them?

01:31:05.252 --> 01:31:06.544
You don't hate me?

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:07.962
No. Oh, I did, Charlie.

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:09.964
I really did, but...

01:31:10.048 --> 01:31:11.173
Now...

01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:15.219
No.

01:31:16.555 --> 01:31:17.721
Kate.

01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:21.100
I...

01:31:23.562 --> 01:31:24.895
Oh, sweetie, are you crying?

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:26.105
No.

01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:28.524
No, no. I... I'm...

01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:29.984
You know, I just feel

01:31:30.068 --> 01:31:31.902
so totally, horribly guilty.

01:31:31.987 --> 01:31:33.779
Listen, don't feel guilty,

01:31:33.864 --> 01:31:35.447
because then I'll start
feeling guilty

01:31:35.532 --> 01:31:38.367
that I made you feel
guilty, and...

01:31:39.995 --> 01:31:41.120
You know...

01:31:41.872 --> 01:31:44.331
Actually, that was the old me.

01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:46.584
Just feel guilty. Swim in it

01:31:46.668 --> 01:31:48.252
till your fingers
get all pruny.

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:52.673
You're amazing.

01:31:52.757 --> 01:31:54.341
You really are.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:06.770
Kate.

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:10.107
Will you dance with me?

01:32:10.567 --> 01:32:11.734
Just...

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:14.195
One last dance?

01:32:17.407 --> 01:32:18.741
Please?

01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:36.967
You're right about his chin.
Sometimes I want to hit it.

01:32:38.345 --> 01:32:40.221
He's a waste of your time.

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:42.514
No, he's wonderful...

01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:44.808
so tender.

01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:47.102
Not like a French man.

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:49.605
You know what I mean?

01:32:50.232 --> 01:32:52.483
Yes, I understand.

01:32:52.651 --> 01:32:55.402
How could he do this to me?

01:32:55.862 --> 01:32:58.072
When I was younger...

01:32:58.365 --> 01:33:00.532
this wouldn't have happened.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:04.328
He would be with me in my room
and she would wait all night.

01:33:04.996 --> 01:33:06.747
I can imagine.

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:08.499
Look at me, please.

01:33:09.167 --> 01:33:11.168
Tell me what you see.

01:33:22.097 --> 01:33:24.682
You seem so different...

01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:26.308
But the same.

01:33:28.478 --> 01:33:30.187
It's like somebody
turned a light on

01:33:30.272 --> 01:33:31.522
inside you.

01:33:34.484 --> 01:33:36.318
Why wasn't it me?

01:34:43.553 --> 01:34:44.595
Is something wrong?

01:34:44.846 --> 01:34:46.930
No, in fact everything is fine.

01:34:48.391 --> 01:34:49.516
Wait a second.

01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:51.101
Please forgive me.

01:34:51.936 --> 01:34:53.145
I must have been insane.

01:34:59.069 --> 01:35:00.110
Luc...

01:35:02.238 --> 01:35:03.614
Oh, Kate...

01:35:07.494 --> 01:35:09.495
What did you just say?

01:35:11.414 --> 01:35:12.915
I said "Kate."

01:35:24.677 --> 01:35:25.677
Oh, Kate!

01:35:25.762 --> 01:35:26.762
Stop.

01:35:26.846 --> 01:35:27.888
Yeah. Oh, darling.

01:35:29.015 --> 01:35:30.474
Charlie...

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:32.017
I said... Stop!

01:35:33.186 --> 01:35:34.770
What?

01:35:34.854 --> 01:35:35.896
Charlie...

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.272
What? What?

01:35:37.357 --> 01:35:39.817
Why wasn't it you who
turned on the light...

01:35:39.901 --> 01:35:41.110
The big shining Kate light

01:35:41.194 --> 01:35:42.361
that burns so bright now

01:35:42.445 --> 01:35:44.530
that you can't resist dumping

01:35:44.614 --> 01:35:46.198
your new girlfriend
for your old one?

01:35:46.282 --> 01:35:47.491
What?

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:51.662
12 hours ago, all you
wanted was Juliette.

01:35:52.497 --> 01:35:53.956
Juliette? I...

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.624
She's wonderful...

01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:57.126
Exciting.

01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:58.419
And...

01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:00.629
When I met her,

01:36:00.713 --> 01:36:02.631
I wasn't thinking.

01:36:02.715 --> 01:36:04.299
Sometimes you just do things.

01:36:04.384 --> 01:36:06.009
You don't think about them.

01:36:06.094 --> 01:36:08.011
You just need to do them,

01:36:08.096 --> 01:36:09.930
do what you're feeling.

01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:12.099
Maybe... Maybe I was
just... I was afraid,

01:36:12.183 --> 01:36:14.351
afraid of where we were headed.

01:36:14.436 --> 01:36:17.271
You know? I was afraid
of getting married.

01:36:17.355 --> 01:36:18.439
Charlie?

01:36:19.899 --> 01:36:22.401
You weren't afraid of
getting married to her.

01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:40.461
You know, no matter what
I might seem like tonight,

01:36:40.545 --> 01:36:42.421
it's still the same
old me from yesterday

01:36:42.505 --> 01:36:45.299
you'd wind up with tomorrow...

01:36:45.383 --> 01:36:47.342
The same old me

01:36:47.427 --> 01:36:48.927
who wants the home
and the family,

01:36:49.012 --> 01:36:51.263
who wants to plant some roots

01:36:51.389 --> 01:36:53.223
and see them grow.

01:36:55.935 --> 01:36:57.978
You want to be a farmer?

01:37:00.190 --> 01:37:01.482
Sorry.

01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:15.412
There's just one thing
I don't want anymore.

01:37:18.791 --> 01:37:20.584
I'm sorry, Charlie.

01:37:29.052 --> 01:37:30.677
Yeah, it's open.

01:37:34.599 --> 01:37:39.311
Good morning.

01:37:42.732 --> 01:37:44.358
So how did it go?

01:37:44.442 --> 01:37:45.609
What happened?

01:37:47.403 --> 01:37:49.696
Well, he wants to come back.

01:37:53.284 --> 01:37:54.993
Congratulations.

01:37:58.122 --> 01:37:59.206
What about you?

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:00.490
The old bull back in business?

01:38:08.841 --> 01:38:10.551
We better get going.

01:38:10.635 --> 01:38:12.010
Cartier is waiting.

01:38:41.207 --> 01:38:42.249
Merci.

01:38:45.295 --> 01:38:47.045
Everything as you said.

01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:48.338
The egg?

01:38:49.257 --> 01:38:50.257
Nest egg.

01:38:51.634 --> 01:38:53.760
It was wired from
your bank in Toronto,

01:38:53.845 --> 01:38:56.555
and Cartier's agreed
to issue the check

01:38:56.639 --> 01:38:57.931
in exchange.

01:38:58.016 --> 01:38:59.808
The illusion is complete.

01:39:03.938 --> 01:39:05.355
Thank you.

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:08.942
Why are you doing this?

01:39:09.027 --> 01:39:10.444
You're not with Luc.

01:39:10.528 --> 01:39:12.863
You will probably
never see him again.

01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:17.075
I don't know.

01:39:20.496 --> 01:39:22.456
I must come to Canada someday.

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:25.208
You are a very
sympathetic people.

01:39:26.711 --> 01:39:29.129
Well, I'm not
really a Canadian.

01:39:29.213 --> 01:39:31.214
In fact, I'm...

01:39:31.299 --> 01:39:33.383
Currently without country.

01:39:37.513 --> 01:39:39.556
Just out of curiosity...

01:39:40.767 --> 01:39:42.267
What is it worth?

01:39:43.936 --> 01:39:45.270
I would say

01:39:45.355 --> 01:39:47.939
over $100,000.

01:39:54.656 --> 01:39:56.907
45,782...

01:39:56.991 --> 01:39:58.825
What do... Do... Do...

01:39:58.910 --> 01:40:00.160
This is not possible!

01:40:00.244 --> 01:40:01.328
Wha...

01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:04.373
Why did I listen to you

01:40:04.457 --> 01:40:06.917
and your little walk and...

01:40:07.001 --> 01:40:08.710
He said there was a flaw.

01:40:08.795 --> 01:40:10.253
- A flaw?
- Some flaws.

01:40:10.338 --> 01:40:11.421
Some flaws?

01:40:11.506 --> 01:40:13.215
Right. He said they're
beautiful diamonds,

01:40:13.299 --> 01:40:15.425
but officially,
there are these flaws.

01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:16.635
Sorry.

01:40:18.221 --> 01:40:19.805
It's OK.

01:40:19.889 --> 01:40:20.889
It's OK?

01:40:22.058 --> 01:40:24.267
It is not as much

01:40:24.352 --> 01:40:25.352
as I was hoping,

01:40:25.436 --> 01:40:27.854
but it is enough
to buy the land

01:40:27.939 --> 01:40:30.941
and to start the planting.

01:40:31.025 --> 01:40:32.609
It will take longer,
maybe six years

01:40:32.694 --> 01:40:34.403
before we have a decent bottle,

01:40:34.487 --> 01:40:35.737
but...

01:40:36.906 --> 01:40:38.198
Thank you.

01:40:38.991 --> 01:40:40.117
Thank you very much.

01:40:40.201 --> 01:40:42.327
You're my angel of luck.

01:40:43.329 --> 01:40:45.372
Who would have thought it?

01:40:58.469 --> 01:41:00.053
I have to go...

01:41:00.138 --> 01:41:01.638
'Cause Charlie's waiting.

01:41:35.465 --> 01:41:37.632
No, I... I love you!

01:41:42.221 --> 01:41:44.139
I had dinner with her...

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:50.270
Why don't you go back to her?

01:41:50.354 --> 01:41:53.982
You went up to the room
like a freed stri...

01:41:54.609 --> 01:41:55.901
Juliette!

01:42:10.249 --> 01:42:13.251
Love, it's wonderful.

01:42:14.837 --> 01:42:16.755
What are you doing here?

01:42:16.839 --> 01:42:20.050
Some guy paid his hotel bill
with a stolen credit card.

01:42:20.134 --> 01:42:22.135
I've taken care of it.

01:42:26.808 --> 01:42:29.142
That's not true love.

01:42:29.894 --> 01:42:31.728
What do you know?

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:34.147
Would you like to hear
a true love story?

01:42:34.232 --> 01:42:36.066
I know a good one.

01:42:38.945 --> 01:42:40.278
Really?

01:42:40.488 --> 01:42:41.822
Does it have a happy ending?

01:42:41.948 --> 01:42:43.198
I don't know.

01:42:43.282 --> 01:42:46.117
Maybe you can help with the ending.

01:42:46.786 --> 01:42:47.786
Me?

01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:49.371
Yes.

01:42:49.539 --> 01:42:52.833
Imagine... an airplane.

01:43:12.937 --> 01:43:13.979
Kate?

01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.025
Yes?

01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:21.945
You are not afraid
to fly anymore?

01:43:22.738 --> 01:43:25.949
You are thinking of your
little stone cottage?

01:43:27.368 --> 01:43:30.996
It's on a hillside next
to a beautiful vineyard.

01:43:31.956 --> 01:43:34.040
But that's not really
what I'm thinking about.

01:43:34.125 --> 01:43:35.500
What are you thinking about?

01:43:38.796 --> 01:43:39.921
You.

01:43:47.179 --> 01:43:49.139
And I am thinking...

01:43:49.223 --> 01:43:51.516
You should not
be flying anywhere.

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:54.144
I shouldn't?

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:56.771
In fact, I am sure of it.

01:43:57.398 --> 01:43:58.607
You are?

01:43:58.691 --> 01:44:00.650
I am thinking...

01:44:00.735 --> 01:44:02.319
I want you...

01:44:05.698 --> 01:44:07.282
You want me...

01:44:08.659 --> 01:44:09.826
That's all.

01:44:11.329 --> 01:44:13.038
I want you.

01:44:21.797 --> 01:44:24.090
Hold Me Close

01:44:24.175 --> 01:44:26.509
And Hold Me Fast

01:44:26.594 --> 01:44:30.096
The Magic Spell You cast

01:44:30.181 --> 01:44:34.684
This Is La vie en rose

01:44:35.269 --> 01:44:38.146
When You Kiss Me

01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:40.357
Heaven Sighs

01:44:41.984 --> 01:44:43.735
And Though I close my eyes

01:44:43.819 --> 01:44:48.490
I See La vie en rose

01:44:49.325 --> 01:44:51.743
When You Press Me

01:44:51.827 --> 01:44:54.037
To Your Heart

01:44:54.121 --> 01:44:57.207
And In A World Apart

01:44:57.291 --> 01:45:02.420
A World Where roses bloom

01:45:02.505 --> 01:45:04.589
And When You Speak

01:45:04.674 --> 01:45:09.427
Angels Sing From Above

01:45:09.512 --> 01:45:12.931
Everyday Words Seems

01:45:13.015 --> 01:45:16.434
To Turn Into Love's Song

01:45:16.519 --> 01:45:17.560
Give

01:45:17.645 --> 01:45:20.939
Your Heart And soul to me

01:45:21.023 --> 01:45:25.235
And Life Will Always Be

01:45:25.319 --> 01:45:28.738
La Vie En Rose

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:10.989
Luc, sing that song again.

01:46:11.073 --> 01:46:12.032
What song?

01:46:12.116 --> 01:46:13.199
The Bobby Darin song.

01:46:13.284 --> 01:46:15.285
It's not Bobby Darin.

01:46:15.369 --> 01:46:16.536
Yeah, the Bobby Darin song.

01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:17.704
Charles Trenet.

01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:20.415
No. Somewhere Beyond the sea...

01:46:20.499 --> 01:46:22.083
No, no, no. La Mer.

01:46:22.168 --> 01:46:23.209
It is La Mer.

01:46:23.294 --> 01:46:25.420
Well, maybe your guy
covered it for Bobby.

01:46:25.504 --> 01:46:27.464
No. It is a French song.

01:46:27.965 --> 01:46:29.883
Could you just sing the song?

01:48:20.953 --> 01:48:24.080
