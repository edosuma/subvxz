WEBVTT

00:00.999 --> 00:03.077
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...

00:03.102 --> 00:04.303
How much does
Steve McGarrett know

00:04.327 --> 00:06.357
about what his father was investigating

00:06.382 --> 00:07.749
before you killed him?

00:08.007 --> 00:09.335
How close is he to the truth?

00:10.176 --> 00:11.445
Too close.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.639
- You, what's your name?
- Wo Fat.

00:13.664 --> 00:16.078
You're not going to kill me. Are you?

00:16.103 --> 00:18.201
- Brother?
- You're not my brother.

00:22.096 --> 00:23.783
These aren't the
guys you want to tangle with.

00:23.807 --> 00:26.376
Your actions have placed
my daughter in great danger,

00:26.401 --> 00:28.569
when I have already
arranged for her return.

00:28.594 --> 00:29.795
These are not honorable men.

00:29.819 --> 00:31.287
- How can you take them at their word?
- Because I'm

00:31.311 --> 00:32.896
giving them exactly what they want.

00:32.921 --> 00:35.051
You're transferring power?

00:35.076 --> 00:37.329
It's a father's sacrifice.

00:37.354 --> 00:39.580
Daddy, no.

00:39.605 --> 00:41.382
Daddy, please, please, no!

00:41.407 --> 00:43.531
You abducted this
man, brought him here.

00:43.556 --> 00:46.748
I will make sure the authorities
find out about your role

00:46.773 --> 00:48.724
in everything that took place tonight.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.654
And your career with
Five-O will be over.

00:50.679 --> 00:53.002
Kenji, don't, don't, don't, don't! No!

00:53.295 --> 00:55.090
Hey.

00:55.115 --> 00:56.382
- Steve.
- Hey, Adam.

00:56.407 --> 00:59.108
If you're up for it, I'd actually
like to see you at HQ now.

01:00.744 --> 01:02.345
I'm on my way.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.069 --> 01:26.469
Hey, Adam.

01:26.896 --> 01:28.614
Uh, thanks for coming in.

01:28.639 --> 01:30.004
Yeah, of course.

01:30.029 --> 01:31.850
Uh, sorry I couldn't make it in earlier.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.318
What's going on?

01:35.772 --> 01:37.472
This your watch?

01:39.585 --> 01:42.587
There's an inscription on
the back from Kono, so...

01:54.929 --> 01:56.065
Thank you.

01:56.090 --> 01:58.117
Must be a relief to get it back, huh?

01:58.142 --> 01:59.976
Yeah. It is.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.508
So, look, I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation,

02:05.851 --> 02:07.265
uh, but HPD,

02:07.290 --> 02:11.681
they-they found that watch at
a crime scene earlier today.

02:11.706 --> 02:12.839
It was an armed robbery.

02:12.864 --> 02:15.273
Of an illegal card game in Kalihi.

02:15.298 --> 02:17.265
So I just got to ask you...

02:17.684 --> 02:19.418
do you know anything about that?

02:24.039 --> 02:25.847
Hey, Adam, look, the card game

02:25.872 --> 02:27.983
was being operated by a Filipino gang

02:28.008 --> 02:29.675
who are beefing with the Yakuza,

02:29.700 --> 02:31.934
and the robbery happened
just a couple hours

02:31.959 --> 02:34.027
after you called in sick, so I just...

02:34.052 --> 02:38.164
I need you to tell me that you
weren't involved in any way.

02:38.780 --> 02:40.447
Right.

02:50.382 --> 02:51.649
What is this?

02:54.423 --> 02:56.091
What is this?

02:56.903 --> 02:58.137
Sorry, Steve.

02:58.162 --> 02:59.418
Adam...

02:59.443 --> 03:01.644
You're sorry? What, you're just
gonna walk out of my office?

03:01.669 --> 03:03.099
Wait. Adam.

03:03.385 --> 03:04.785
Hey, Adam.

03:05.803 --> 03:08.661
Hey! I'm talking to you!

03:10.707 --> 03:12.642
I've had your back from day one.

03:12.972 --> 03:16.582
When the FBI was all over you,
they wanted you for murder.

03:16.607 --> 03:19.742
When everything was
going on with Noriko. Huh?

03:19.847 --> 03:22.685
And now, now you won't
even show me the courtesy

03:22.753 --> 03:25.488
of explaining to me what
the hell is going on.

03:28.025 --> 03:29.761
You're right, Steve.

03:30.453 --> 03:34.056
After everything you've done
for me, you deserve the truth.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.955
I can't give you that.

03:55.309 --> 04:00.309

-- <font color="#138CE9">for www.addic7ed.com</font> --

04:25.006 --> 04:26.825
Maybe you
misunderstood his meaning.

04:27.229 --> 04:28.560
He took his badge and his gun off

04:28.585 --> 04:30.861
and put 'em on my table and
walked out the door, Danny.

04:30.886 --> 04:32.635
The meaning's pretty clear, is it not?

04:32.660 --> 04:34.620
Huh, he lost faith in
your leadership skills?

04:34.645 --> 04:36.464
- Stupid.
- I don't know, there's got to be

04:36.489 --> 04:37.581
a reasonable explanation.

04:37.606 --> 04:39.109
That's what I said, and
that's what I asked him for.

04:39.134 --> 04:40.067
And here's the thing.

04:40.815 --> 04:43.300
Historically, any time
Adam's been in trouble,

04:43.325 --> 04:45.315
he's come to me and been
transparent about it,

04:45.340 --> 04:46.690
regardless of the nature of the trouble.

04:46.717 --> 04:48.184
But this time, nothing.

04:48.534 --> 04:49.643
I-I understand.

04:49.668 --> 04:51.089
So, give me a chance to talk to him.

04:51.114 --> 04:52.314
- That's all.
- Have at it.

04:52.503 --> 04:54.314
I'm telling you, he looks
good for this robbery.

04:54.338 --> 04:55.505
Duke is gonna go after him.

04:55.530 --> 04:57.283
And, frankly, I can't blame him.

04:57.308 --> 04:58.241
I understand.

04:58.309 --> 04:59.676
Let me talk to him. I mean,

04:59.701 --> 05:01.087
I'm-I'm the guy who gave him his badge.

05:01.112 --> 05:03.157
Let me see why he wants to
throw it away, that's all.

05:03.224 --> 05:04.757
All right.

05:04.825 --> 05:06.025
Do me a favor, would you?

05:06.050 --> 05:07.327
Until we, uh, get to the bottom of this,

05:07.351 --> 05:09.846
maybe just keep it between you and me.
Can you manage that?

05:09.871 --> 05:12.031
Can I man... ? I'm the, I'm
the picture of discretion.

05:12.056 --> 05:13.534
Sure I can manage it.

05:15.003 --> 05:16.502
You're the picture of homelessness.

05:16.527 --> 05:18.395
What's going on? You
didn't go home last night?

05:19.167 --> 05:20.873
- Go ahead.
- Hang on.

05:20.941 --> 05:22.275
So, I went home,

05:22.300 --> 05:25.602
and, uh, there was a smell.

05:25.627 --> 05:26.660
A smell?

05:26.685 --> 05:28.290
There was a sewage backup at my place.

05:28.315 --> 05:31.103
Um... and, uh, it was pretty gross.

05:31.128 --> 05:33.429
I-I ended up spending most of the night

05:33.454 --> 05:35.589
- trying to clean it up.
- Let me get this straight.

05:35.614 --> 05:40.237
You invented a fake mold story
at your house so you could stay

05:40.262 --> 05:43.103
at my house, and in the meantime

05:43.128 --> 05:45.565
- the sewage explodes at your house?
- Yeah.

05:45.590 --> 05:47.158
Yeah, the irony is not lost on me.

05:47.183 --> 05:49.135
But I want you to know that the reason,

05:49.160 --> 05:50.771
in the first place,
that I went to your place

05:50.795 --> 05:53.363
and created that mold
story is to be there for you

05:53.388 --> 05:55.589
- in your time of need.
- Yes.

05:55.964 --> 05:58.477
And I was very touched. Thank you.

05:58.502 --> 06:00.503
So you got your, uh...

06:00.528 --> 06:02.014
got your stuff back out of the house

06:02.039 --> 06:03.317
to save it from the aggressive smell.

06:03.341 --> 06:05.008
You even brought a little bons...

06:05.033 --> 06:06.925
I didn't know you kept bonsai.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.276
This is a...

06:08.301 --> 06:09.812
Uh, yeah, I got it a
couple of months ago.

06:09.837 --> 06:13.206
It's actually, um, for
therapeutic purposes.

06:13.618 --> 06:15.128
You trim it a couple
times a week, and it's...

06:15.194 --> 06:17.029
and it's supposed to promote new growth.

06:17.054 --> 06:18.955
I hadn't planned on sharing it with you,

06:19.023 --> 06:20.167
or anybody else for that matter.

06:20.191 --> 06:21.268
But if you want to make fun of me...

06:21.292 --> 06:23.193
I'm not making fun of you, Mr. Miyagi.

06:23.218 --> 06:25.438
I think it's nice.
It's a very Zen thing.

06:25.463 --> 06:27.931
A lot of people do it,
and frankly I'm glad

06:27.956 --> 06:29.842
you have a hobby that
doesn't involve annoying me.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.768
- You know?
- Right. Here's the thing.

06:31.836 --> 06:32.846
The sewage thing is not gonna be,

06:32.870 --> 06:34.237
like, an easy cleanup.

06:34.262 --> 06:37.049
Um, it's actually a big deal.

06:37.074 --> 06:39.009
They-they got to pull
up the floorboards,

06:39.076 --> 06:40.754
and there's water damage
and all that kind of stuff.

06:40.778 --> 06:43.914
So I now, uh, in the meantime,

06:43.939 --> 06:48.212
need a... a place to crash.

06:48.595 --> 06:50.811
For real now.

06:50.965 --> 06:52.465
Yes, you can stay at my house

06:52.490 --> 06:53.806
for another week or two, it's fine.

06:53.831 --> 06:56.733
Six to eight weeks, says the contractor.

06:57.978 --> 07:00.050
- Whatever.
- Wow, you folded very

07:00.075 --> 07:01.726
quickly there.

07:01.751 --> 07:02.832
Yeah, well...

07:02.857 --> 07:04.658
I mean, you using all my clean towels

07:04.769 --> 07:06.480
is kind of the least of my
worries with everything else

07:06.504 --> 07:07.437
going on.

07:07.462 --> 07:08.829
McGarrett.

07:10.115 --> 07:13.617
Oh, copy that. We'll get right on it.

07:17.048 --> 07:18.915
So, what happened here?

07:18.940 --> 07:21.025
Earlier this morning,
a helicopter registered

07:21.050 --> 07:23.882
to a company called Oahu Sunrise Tours

07:23.907 --> 07:26.218
was in the middle of one
of its scenic flyovers

07:26.243 --> 07:29.135
when, according to
eyewitnesses, it exploded.

07:29.203 --> 07:30.937
We have seven confirmed fatalities.

07:31.212 --> 07:34.197
- Six passengers and the pilot.
- Okay.

07:34.307 --> 07:37.843
So, uh, we're standing
in NTSB's way for what?

07:37.911 --> 07:39.415
You gonna tell me it wasn't an accident?

07:39.440 --> 07:41.087
Apparently, a spark in
the fuel line could have

07:41.112 --> 07:42.954
caused an explosion like this.

07:42.979 --> 07:44.736
But according to FAA's paperwork,

07:44.761 --> 07:46.929
they said that the chopper
was inspected a week ago

07:46.954 --> 07:49.353
and was in shipshape.
And then there's this.

07:50.048 --> 07:51.657
So, this is audio
that was provided to us

07:51.682 --> 07:53.007
by the tour company. Lucky for us,

07:53.032 --> 07:54.960
- all in-flight comms are recorded.
- Yeah.

07:54.985 --> 07:56.595
And if you guys look
out the right-side window,

07:56.620 --> 07:58.297
you'll see Koko Head.

07:58.322 --> 08:01.858
It's an easy 1,048 steps
to the top of that crater.

08:01.883 --> 08:04.070
Don't worry if you missed
your photo op, I'm...

08:04.095 --> 08:05.048
Wow.

08:05.073 --> 08:06.782
See, there's no alarm that
goes off in the cockpit.

08:06.807 --> 08:08.782
There's no indication
that the pilot even knew

08:08.807 --> 08:09.907
there was something wrong.

08:09.932 --> 08:11.277
Okay. So what are you thinking?

08:11.302 --> 08:12.479
There was a bomb on board or what?

08:12.503 --> 08:13.680
It's the most plausible explanation,

08:13.704 --> 08:15.138
but the question is:

08:15.163 --> 08:16.763
why target that specific chopper?

08:16.874 --> 08:19.576
Yeah. Well, a bomb aboard

08:19.601 --> 08:21.269
any aircraft...

08:21.294 --> 08:23.632
Usually terrorism, but I
don't know if I buy that

08:23.657 --> 08:25.931
with, uh, this being
such a small target.

08:25.956 --> 08:27.642
No, there was no bomb on the helo.

08:28.052 --> 08:29.972
You can check this out.
See this hole right here?

08:29.997 --> 08:32.664
It's from the blast. Except the puncture

08:32.688 --> 08:34.259
is from the outside in.

08:34.284 --> 08:35.739
Like it was hit by a projectile.

08:35.871 --> 08:38.472
My best guess... a rocket launcher.

08:39.078 --> 08:42.081
So someone shot the
helicopter out of the sky.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.414
I'm so sorry, Auntie.

08:51.564 --> 08:54.125
I love you. I'll see you later.

08:59.752 --> 09:00.919
Hey, how'd that go?

09:00.944 --> 09:02.545
Awful.

09:02.655 --> 09:04.589
I mean, it's all awful, right?

09:04.657 --> 09:07.458
I shouldn't be the one
telling her her brother...

09:10.121 --> 09:11.470
Hey.

09:15.046 --> 09:16.112
I'm so sorry.

09:16.435 --> 09:19.370
No, come on. Don't be sorry, Tamiko.

09:19.395 --> 09:21.630
It's just, it's so much at once.

09:21.655 --> 09:24.473
Dad's gone. There are
all these people to tell,

09:24.498 --> 09:25.899
decisions to make.

09:25.945 --> 09:27.445
Hey, hey.

09:27.513 --> 09:30.214
Hey... let's not forget

09:30.239 --> 09:32.274
you were also kidnapped yesterday.

09:42.795 --> 09:44.525
I'm glad you're here.

09:46.163 --> 09:47.797
Where else would I be?

09:51.025 --> 09:54.448
It's odd, though.

09:54.473 --> 09:56.674
You're here.

09:56.952 --> 10:00.392
You see my pain, my family's pain.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.337
The people you work with...

10:03.983 --> 10:07.618
Won't be long before
they find out what happened.

10:08.228 --> 10:11.998
When they do, they
won't exactly be grieving

10:12.325 --> 10:14.040
the news that my father's gone.

10:17.903 --> 10:19.666
Or did you tell them already?

10:22.991 --> 10:24.458
I did speak to Steve,

10:24.635 --> 10:26.023
but...

10:27.106 --> 10:29.340
Tamiko, there's something
you should know.

10:33.889 --> 10:36.457
Not exactly your standard
fare, the old rocket launcher.

10:36.482 --> 10:38.216
It must be pretty hard to get ahold of.

10:38.283 --> 10:39.817
Well, MANPADS are pretty easy

10:39.842 --> 10:41.843
to get on the black market nowadays.

10:41.868 --> 10:44.303
Yeah, they cost you around 500 bucks.

10:44.385 --> 10:47.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa. "Man pads"?

10:47.259 --> 10:50.738
Yeah, man-portable air defense system.

10:50.953 --> 10:52.440
I thought you was talking
about something else.

10:52.464 --> 10:53.575
You and your fancy acronyms.

10:53.599 --> 10:54.899
What's up?

10:54.967 --> 10:57.435
So, um, this cove is a pretty
popular surf spot in the summer,

10:57.503 --> 10:59.470
- so I searched it on SurfScanner.
- What's that?

10:59.580 --> 11:01.816
It's a service.
They put cameras on the beach

11:01.840 --> 11:03.141
to live-stream the swells.

11:03.208 --> 11:05.009
Anyway, I found

11:05.034 --> 11:07.335
an archived stream of this cove.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.627
Check it out.

11:08.824 --> 11:10.591
This is 8:42 a.m.

11:10.616 --> 11:12.736
This is right before the
911 call about the explosion.

11:15.867 --> 11:17.301
Here's the instant replay.

11:23.293 --> 11:24.729
There's our rocket launcher.

11:24.754 --> 11:25.687
It was fired

11:25.712 --> 11:27.546
from that ridge right there.

13:32.721 --> 13:34.811
So, we got seven innocent people dead,

13:34.836 --> 13:37.171
all with nothing in common
aside from being passengers

13:37.196 --> 13:38.896
in that helicopter this morning.

13:38.921 --> 13:41.032
All right. Do we know which
one was the intended target?

13:41.057 --> 13:42.760
I'm betting on this guy.

13:42.785 --> 13:44.669
Ellison Jones.

13:44.779 --> 13:47.648
Ellison was a Wall
Street hedge fund manager,

13:47.673 --> 13:49.640
and he was apparently pretty successful.

13:49.665 --> 13:50.932
That is, according to the bio

13:50.957 --> 13:52.796
on his company's website.

13:52.821 --> 13:55.923
Nothing really about anybody
who might have wanted him dead.

13:55.948 --> 13:57.915
Nothing on that yet, except...

13:58.211 --> 14:00.627
when Ellison landed here on Oahu,

14:00.906 --> 14:03.397
the first thing he did to
start his tropical vacation

14:03.422 --> 14:07.312
was go to a local bank, withdraw 50 Gs.

14:07.425 --> 14:08.602
That's a lot of piña coladas.

14:08.627 --> 14:09.788
Indeed.

14:09.813 --> 14:12.206
And despite the fact
that Ellison is unmarried

14:12.231 --> 14:14.832
and booked the helicopter
tour for himself only,

14:15.179 --> 14:18.312
he was holding down two rooms
at the Grand Honolulu Hotel.

14:18.337 --> 14:20.178
All right. Well, that's
a good place to start.

14:20.203 --> 14:22.240
Oh.

14:22.265 --> 14:24.065
Hey, look, it's Joons.
I'm gonna patch him in.

14:25.744 --> 14:27.678
Junior, you find
anything on that hillside?

14:27.789 --> 14:29.423
Yeah. I found this.

14:29.448 --> 14:30.648
- Oh.
- Nice.

14:30.716 --> 14:32.227
All right, Junior,
those things usually have

14:32.251 --> 14:34.234
a serial number. Have
you had a look yet?

14:34.259 --> 14:36.263
Yeah, I did, and it does.

14:36.288 --> 14:39.499
I'm sending a photo your way now.

14:39.524 --> 14:40.877
Just got it. Thank you.

14:40.902 --> 14:42.970
I'm gonna reach out to
our folks at the DoD,

14:42.995 --> 14:44.262
see if they can trace it.

14:44.287 --> 14:46.039
In the meantime, let's
get it back to CSU

14:46.064 --> 14:48.032
and have them run it for prints, please.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.134
- Will do, boss.
- Yeah. Nice find, Junior.

14:50.159 --> 14:51.178
Talk to you soon, all right?

14:51.203 --> 14:52.436
Mahalo.

14:52.461 --> 14:53.614
Hey, Danny, Tani,

14:53.639 --> 14:55.316
you guys maybe head over
to the Grand Honolulu,

14:55.340 --> 14:57.252
see if we can find out
why this Ellison Jones guy

14:57.276 --> 14:59.710
needs two rooms and a big pile
of cash. Lou, why don't you

14:59.735 --> 15:01.421
dig into the rest of these
people that were on board,

15:01.446 --> 15:03.730
see if we're missing anything.

15:06.234 --> 15:08.569
Thank you.

15:09.862 --> 15:11.830
Hey, you want to take a break?

15:11.855 --> 15:13.088
We can step outside.

15:13.325 --> 15:14.469
- I'm fine.
- You know, people wouldn't mind

15:14.493 --> 15:16.060
- if you need some time...
- Tamiko.

15:18.392 --> 15:20.727
I'm so sorry for your loss.

15:21.729 --> 15:23.396
Thank you.

15:25.347 --> 15:26.980
You should know,

15:27.269 --> 15:29.149
we made sure that the man who did this

15:29.174 --> 15:31.676
did not make it out of
the jungle last night.

15:33.128 --> 15:34.894
It won't bring Masuda-San back,

15:34.919 --> 15:38.396
but... perhaps it will
bring some small comfort.

15:44.022 --> 15:45.022
Tamiko.

15:45.047 --> 15:47.482
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

15:48.570 --> 15:49.670
Hey,

15:49.695 --> 15:50.975
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

15:57.796 --> 16:00.047
I've got to say, that was
quite the performance, Kenji.

16:00.072 --> 16:01.671
Bravo.

16:07.436 --> 16:10.738
Not a performance. I loved Masuda-San.

16:11.539 --> 16:13.026
I'm sure you did.

16:13.051 --> 16:15.414
Right up until the moment
when you killed him.

16:16.968 --> 16:18.498
You should know,

16:18.820 --> 16:22.159
whatever leverage you thought
you had on me, it's gone.

16:22.413 --> 16:23.914
I quit Five-O.

16:25.710 --> 16:27.043
If anything...

16:29.009 --> 16:31.664
quitting Five-O only
leaves you more exposed.

16:32.627 --> 16:34.438
Your friends are going to be looking

16:34.506 --> 16:36.556
into Masuda's final hours.

16:37.218 --> 16:38.952
What if they learn that you brought

16:38.977 --> 16:41.174
a bound and gagged man to his house?

16:41.963 --> 16:43.247
What if they learn

16:43.272 --> 16:44.619
that man never left?

16:46.127 --> 16:49.763
I have men who will say that
you pulled the trigger yourself.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.347
Someone in your position

16:52.581 --> 16:55.142
should have few
vulnerabilities, Noshimuri.

16:58.730 --> 17:00.041
You have many.

17:08.507 --> 17:10.107
- Well, this is very confusing.
- _

17:10.132 --> 17:11.386
I mean, I-I would think that a guy

17:11.410 --> 17:12.785
that could pull out $50,000 cash

17:12.810 --> 17:14.654
like it's nothing would
be staying at a nice place.

17:14.679 --> 17:16.719
This is a dump. I mean,
this guy's basically staying

17:16.748 --> 17:18.915
in-in-in the boiler room.

17:19.508 --> 17:22.752
Boiler room? What, is that
some baby boomer lingo?

17:22.778 --> 17:25.390
Did you say "baby boomer"?
That's... I'm-I'm offended.

17:25.415 --> 17:29.351
My feelings are hurt. And I-I should
fire you just for saying that.

17:29.376 --> 17:30.868
And for your edification,

17:30.893 --> 17:33.395
the boiler room is the place in which...

17:33.830 --> 17:35.938
the... they boil, uh,

17:35.963 --> 17:37.797
energy to power things.

17:38.031 --> 17:39.832
Okay. Thanks, Bill Nye.

17:40.001 --> 17:42.407
Well, the penthouse suite is great.

17:42.432 --> 17:44.305
It's wonderful.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.654
It's full of women's clothing,

17:45.679 --> 17:48.047
so I don't think
Ellison was staying here.

17:48.174 --> 17:50.829
Uh-huh. So the-the
multimillionaire stays

17:50.854 --> 17:53.435
in the basement and his lady friend,

17:53.460 --> 17:54.894
uh, gets the fancy suite.

17:55.196 --> 17:56.897
Wonder who his lucky companion is.

17:59.077 --> 18:01.412
I don't know, but I think
I'm about to find out.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.672
Who the hell are you?

18:08.697 --> 18:11.432
That's funny. I was gonna
ask you the same question.

18:12.165 --> 18:14.833
Just so we're clear here,
I didn't break any laws.

18:15.018 --> 18:17.735
My relationship with
Ellison is completely legal.

18:18.367 --> 18:21.774
Okay. What-what is
your relationship with him?

18:21.799 --> 18:23.934
- I'm his findomme.
- Oh.

18:23.959 --> 18:25.126
Cash master.

18:25.287 --> 18:27.388
Money mistress?

18:27.413 --> 18:29.110
Mm...

18:30.022 --> 18:31.422
Okay, here, I'll show you.

18:31.447 --> 18:33.016
You got a 20?

18:34.324 --> 18:36.425
Uh, yeah, sure.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.954
See, some men...

18:41.050 --> 18:42.243
Rich men...

18:42.268 --> 18:44.069
Men who never hear "no,"

18:44.656 --> 18:46.500
sometimes they enjoy being
controlled where it hurts

18:46.525 --> 18:48.993
the most.

18:49.192 --> 18:50.625
Their wallets.

18:50.650 --> 18:52.418
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

18:53.247 --> 18:55.114
Wow. She actually did that.

18:59.645 --> 19:01.040
Did you enjoy that?

19:01.065 --> 19:02.899
- No, I didn't enjoy that at all.
- Well, then,

19:02.924 --> 19:04.758
you probably don't need my services.

19:04.782 --> 19:06.702
Uh, yeah, I don't
think, uh, Ellison Jones

19:06.727 --> 19:08.743
needs your services anymore, either.

19:08.781 --> 19:09.781
What do you mean?

19:10.787 --> 19:12.521
He was on a helicopter this morning

19:12.877 --> 19:14.144
and there was an explosion.

19:14.169 --> 19:16.737
I'm-I'm sorry, but he didn't make it.

19:20.265 --> 19:22.008
Oh, my God.

19:22.860 --> 19:24.835
Oh, my God.

19:24.903 --> 19:26.641
This is all my fault.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.749
He wasn't even supposed
to be on that helicopter.

19:28.774 --> 19:29.961
What do you mean?

19:29.986 --> 19:32.488
The scenic tour was booked
for me three days ago.

19:32.853 --> 19:35.722
But then, I don't
know, the pilot canceled

19:35.747 --> 19:38.815
a few hours before takeoff, and...

19:39.211 --> 19:41.628
Well, I didn't get
around to rescheduling,

19:41.758 --> 19:44.063
and when I finally did, he
only had this morning available

19:44.088 --> 19:46.223
and I had a personal shopper booked.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.059
So I sent Ellison instead.

19:49.127 --> 19:51.016
So the pilot canceled

19:51.041 --> 19:53.273
your tour three days ago?

19:53.298 --> 19:55.933
Yeah, like, a few hours before takeoff.

19:56.043 --> 19:59.180
Okay, uh, did he tell
you why he needed to cancel?

19:59.205 --> 20:00.923
Mechanical issues.

20:00.948 --> 20:03.713
He said that he had to take
the helicopter to the shop.

20:05.353 --> 20:06.920
Okay, uh...

20:06.945 --> 20:08.145
just excuse us for a sec.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.788
Two things. The first thing,

20:12.813 --> 20:15.052
I'm actually disappointed that
my school didn't cover findommes

20:15.077 --> 20:16.496
on career day.

20:16.521 --> 20:18.598
Um, the second... that, that excuse

20:18.639 --> 20:20.440
about the mechanical
error, that doesn't track

20:20.465 --> 20:21.543
'cause the chopper was inspected

20:21.568 --> 20:23.279
and cleared a week ago.

20:24.532 --> 20:26.506
Okay, so-so-so the pilot lied.

20:26.531 --> 20:27.908
Let me call Lou. You want to... ?

20:27.933 --> 20:29.500
- Yeah. I do.
- Yeah.

20:35.586 --> 20:37.016
- This is Grover.
- Hey, um...

20:37.041 --> 20:40.062
I think maybe our pilot might
be worth looking into for this,

20:40.087 --> 20:41.354
not the, uh, millionaire.

20:41.379 --> 20:44.412
- I would be inclined to agree.
- Yeah? Why's that?

20:44.437 --> 20:47.302
Because HPD's at the
guy's house right now,

20:47.327 --> 20:49.495
and just getting into
that place was a challenge.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.588
He's got some high-tech
security system,

20:51.613 --> 20:53.643
a less-than-friendly German shepherd,

20:53.668 --> 20:56.736
padlocks, the whole nine,
and all recently acquired.

20:56.761 --> 20:57.828
Plus,

20:57.853 --> 20:59.672
the guy had two unregistered firearms

20:59.697 --> 21:00.764
and a stockpile of ammo.

21:00.875 --> 21:01.975
So, yeah,

21:02.000 --> 21:03.744
probably the millionaire
wasn't, uh, the target.

21:03.768 --> 21:05.168
The guy flying him was.

21:05.193 --> 21:07.461
He knew that hit was coming.
He just didn't know how.

21:10.814 --> 21:13.215
Bad news. No fingerprints on the MANPAD.

21:13.283 --> 21:14.460
- How'd you do with the DoD?
- Well,

21:14.484 --> 21:16.252
we managed to trace the rocket.

21:16.701 --> 21:18.802
Well, that's a start, right?

21:20.110 --> 21:21.123
Yeah.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.040
What-What-What's the matter?

21:26.337 --> 21:27.918
The rocket that brought our helo down

21:27.943 --> 21:29.744
was part of a much larger shipment

21:29.769 --> 21:32.923
of munitions that was stolen
from a Soviet manufacturer

21:32.948 --> 21:35.242
in Kolomna, Russia years ago.

21:35.267 --> 21:38.169
Investigators on the case
never made any arrests,

21:38.194 --> 21:39.994
but they were all
convinced that these weapons

21:40.019 --> 21:41.486
ended up in the hands

21:41.650 --> 21:43.951
of a well-known arms trader

21:43.976 --> 21:45.891
by the name of Wo Fat.

21:47.157 --> 21:48.713
Ah. Way to bury the lede.

21:48.781 --> 21:51.049
Look, I mean, the
guy's been dead for years.

21:51.074 --> 21:52.526
This doesn't change anything.

21:52.551 --> 21:53.685
It certainly doesn't help us

21:53.752 --> 21:55.086
narrow down the suspect pool.

21:55.111 --> 21:56.730
Wo Fat sold weapons to dozens

21:56.755 --> 21:58.508
of syndicates all
around the world, right?

21:58.533 --> 22:00.167
And this weapon in particular

22:00.339 --> 22:01.993
could've changed hands multiple times

22:02.061 --> 22:03.152
since he died.

22:03.177 --> 22:05.044
What about the pilot?
We get anything on him?

22:05.069 --> 22:06.770
Yeah, um... .

22:08.348 --> 22:10.115
Jordan Natua

22:10.140 --> 22:11.574
is the owner, founder and operator

22:11.599 --> 22:13.814
of Oahu Sunrise Tours.

22:13.839 --> 22:15.496
- Okay.
- Now, the guy's been a pilot

22:15.521 --> 22:17.021
for 35 years on this island.

22:17.046 --> 22:19.281
He's got no criminal record.

22:19.306 --> 22:21.808
So it strikes me as very odd

22:21.833 --> 22:24.566
that just three days ago, this guy gets

22:24.591 --> 22:27.472
a sudden onset case of
paranoia and starts spending

22:27.497 --> 22:29.164
a bunch of cash,
beefing up his security.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.656
Three days ago, that's
also when he canceled

22:31.681 --> 22:33.415
Rox Gilmore's scenic tour.

22:33.440 --> 22:34.717
Well, that wasn't the
only one he canceled.

22:34.742 --> 22:35.753
As a matter of fact, he canceled

22:35.778 --> 22:37.211
the entire day's worth

22:37.236 --> 22:39.140
of tours. At a cost of

22:39.165 --> 22:42.152
$6,500 in fees, just... poof...

22:42.177 --> 22:43.738
Did he tell all the other ticket holders

22:43.763 --> 22:45.898
- that his helicopter was in the shop?
- Correct.

22:45.923 --> 22:48.468
We need to figure out why
Natua changed his plans that day.

22:48.493 --> 22:50.327
Well, hell, maybe
somebody else hired him.

22:50.643 --> 22:53.178
Man, ain't nobody
walking away from $6,500

22:53.203 --> 22:56.339
for one day's work unless
you got a better offer.

22:56.364 --> 22:58.183
Okay, I'm gonna reach out to NTSB

22:58.208 --> 23:00.058
and see if there's any
evidence of a transponder

23:00.083 --> 23:01.947
in the wreckage. If there
was one on the chopper,

23:01.972 --> 23:04.608
that means we can pull the
flight records from the FAA,

23:04.633 --> 23:07.454
find out if and where
that chopper was flying

23:07.479 --> 23:08.756
on the day he canceled the tours.

23:08.781 --> 23:11.082
You know, pull up the
cell phone records as well.

23:11.107 --> 23:12.718
Let's see if we can clock
some of Natua's movements,

23:12.743 --> 23:14.510
because whatever he was up to

23:14.535 --> 23:15.979
three days ago is likely
the reason that helo

23:16.004 --> 23:17.330
came out of the sky.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.523
And whoever he pissed
off was willing to kill

23:19.548 --> 23:22.331
six innocent people to get to him.

23:28.996 --> 23:30.730
That an '85 or an '86?

23:31.066 --> 23:32.426
'85.

23:33.042 --> 23:34.752
Good eye.

23:35.002 --> 23:36.403
I used to drive an '84.

23:36.428 --> 23:38.363
I miss that car.

23:42.206 --> 23:44.038
Yeah, well, your new one's not half bad.

23:44.063 --> 23:46.777
- A Maserati.
- No.

23:46.927 --> 23:49.464
But the El Camino... it has soul.

23:51.370 --> 23:52.761
Take care of it.

23:53.091 --> 23:55.059
You're gonna miss it one day.

23:57.643 --> 24:00.278
Thank you. Hey, you
guys have a good day.

24:11.026 --> 24:12.831
Despite the fact that
he canceled all his tours

24:12.856 --> 24:15.542
three days ago for "mechanical issues,"

24:15.567 --> 24:18.169
Jordan Natua's transponder
said he did in fact

24:18.194 --> 24:19.528
take the chopper out.

24:19.553 --> 24:21.847
This was his route.

24:23.525 --> 24:24.660
What happened?

24:24.685 --> 24:28.035
At 11:16 a.m., he turned
his transponder off.

24:29.308 --> 24:30.375
That's not sketchy.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.567
It gets sketchier.

24:31.592 --> 24:34.127
Nine minutes later, he
turns it back on and returns

24:34.152 --> 24:36.220
- to the heliport.
- Okay, we need to figure out

24:36.245 --> 24:38.057
what happened in that nine
minutes; that's the key

24:38.082 --> 24:41.084
- to this whole thing.
- Well, we know where he went dark.

24:42.354 --> 24:44.769
All right, well, how fast
does this helicopter go?

24:45.452 --> 24:47.925
I mean, single engine,
160 miles per hour, tops.

24:47.950 --> 24:49.654
All right, so he couldn't
have gone that far

24:49.679 --> 24:50.894
- in nine minutes, right?
- No.

24:50.919 --> 24:53.261
Well, whatever happened, it
happened within this radius.

24:53.532 --> 24:56.534
There's a no-fly zone

24:56.559 --> 24:59.261
in that radius. I mean, maybe
Natua turned his transponder off

24:59.286 --> 25:00.620
so he could enter that no-fly zone

25:00.645 --> 25:02.179
without alerting the FAA.

25:02.204 --> 25:03.771
Why, why is it a no-fly zone?

25:03.796 --> 25:06.053
There's no, uh, airport,
there's no military base,

25:06.078 --> 25:07.345
I don't get it.

25:07.370 --> 25:08.956
It's a protected habitat
for the nene geese.

25:08.981 --> 25:12.081
Oh. The nene geese have
their own no-fly zone.

25:12.132 --> 25:15.293
- It's the Hawaiian state bird,
- I get it. It makes no sense

25:15.318 --> 25:17.230
because they don't really fly that much.

25:17.255 --> 25:18.799
Okay, I'm gonna reach out to HPD,

25:18.824 --> 25:20.992
see if they can lend us a helo.

25:21.017 --> 25:23.942
We need to get up here and see what
our pilot was into.

25:23.967 --> 25:25.539
Tani, would you reach out to the FAA

25:25.564 --> 25:26.741
and tell them we're gonna enter

25:26.766 --> 25:28.238
the no-fly zone for this
investigation, please.

25:28.263 --> 25:30.511
- Danny, let's go.
- Hey, if you need me,

25:30.536 --> 25:32.537
I will be on a wild goose chase.

25:44.162 --> 25:45.763
No paperwork.

25:45.788 --> 25:47.789
Understood?

25:48.142 --> 25:49.386
Got it.

25:57.090 --> 26:00.597
_

26:04.043 --> 26:06.445
Yeah, you've reached Adam Noshimuri.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.533
No answer. Still. No answer.

26:09.918 --> 26:13.027
Just 'cause you can get
cell reception at 1,500 feet

26:13.052 --> 26:14.129
does not mean you should use it.

26:14.154 --> 26:15.632
It's against FCC regulations.

26:15.657 --> 26:16.925
- Oh, is it?
- Yes, it is.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.292
We're in a no-fly zone.

26:18.517 --> 26:19.661
I think me using my cell phone

26:19.685 --> 26:20.918
is the least of our worries.

26:20.943 --> 26:23.111
Well, Adam's not gonna pick up anyway.

26:23.136 --> 26:25.170
Look, I'm gonna push
us a quarter-mile north.

26:25.386 --> 26:28.354
Make yourself useful,
will you? Grab those. Here.

26:30.035 --> 26:32.497
Let me ask you a
question. I'm just curious.

26:32.522 --> 26:33.824
What do you think happened?

26:33.849 --> 26:35.310
You think Adam just
completely lost his mind

26:35.334 --> 26:37.565
and decided to start killing
gangsters? Out of nowhere?

26:37.590 --> 26:38.910
Is that what... is that,
is that the thing?

26:38.935 --> 26:42.570
I don't know, Danny. I got to stick
to the facts. Adam has Yakuza ties.

26:42.595 --> 26:43.839
It's possible something happened

26:43.864 --> 26:45.011
that could've pulled him back in.

26:45.036 --> 26:46.568
No. No. There's got to
be a better explanation.

26:46.593 --> 26:49.769
Well, what...

26:49.794 --> 26:51.378
What did he do? He quit the team.

26:51.403 --> 26:52.574
- Yeah. I know.
- Yeah.

26:52.599 --> 26:54.646
- It doesn't make any sense.
- I know. I agree.

26:54.671 --> 26:56.472
Well, maybe he's just bad with people.

26:56.633 --> 26:59.268
Doesn't make any sense. Hey, hey. Hey!

26:59.293 --> 27:00.604
- What do you got?
- Go back, go back, go back.

27:00.629 --> 27:02.063
Brown roof. Brown roof.

27:06.824 --> 27:09.192
Right here. Look it, look,
look. Right there. I s...

27:09.217 --> 27:12.586
- I see... I see...
- What can you see?

27:15.375 --> 27:16.924
It's a body.

27:43.465 --> 27:45.269
Looks like security.

27:45.598 --> 27:47.466
Well, Steve, we got another one.

27:57.074 --> 27:59.108
Both these bodies are in rigor.

27:59.133 --> 28:00.700
I'm thinking they got killed last night.

28:01.124 --> 28:03.058
Didn't have a chance to pull his weapon.

28:04.293 --> 28:05.979
You ready?

28:31.017 --> 28:32.418
Clear.

28:32.623 --> 28:35.392
Clear.

28:37.923 --> 28:39.848
Think I figured out
why there's a small army

28:39.873 --> 28:41.196
guarding this place.

28:51.083 --> 28:53.337
Now, these gun racks
have all been cleared out.

28:53.362 --> 28:55.602
All these crates were
used to store MANPADS

28:55.627 --> 28:56.704
and other ordnance.

28:56.729 --> 28:58.480
Yeah, this doesn't seem like a, um,

28:58.505 --> 29:00.272
a nutjob with a gun fetish.

29:00.297 --> 29:03.299
There was enough firepower
in here to start a war.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.402
And now it's all out there.

29:17.559 --> 29:18.626
Hey.

29:21.725 --> 29:24.618
After losing my fiancé
on my wedding day,

29:24.852 --> 29:26.753
I thought I'd felt all
the pain I could feel.

29:28.102 --> 29:30.110
It's different with a parent.

29:30.685 --> 29:32.649
They're the first ones to know us

29:32.674 --> 29:34.157
and love us.

29:35.404 --> 29:38.373
No matter the differences
we may have with them...

29:40.801 --> 29:44.712
losing them is like losing
a safety net you knew was...

29:45.193 --> 29:46.392
always there.

29:47.874 --> 29:50.165
I didn't have differences with my dad.

29:50.577 --> 29:52.548
I just hated his way of life.

29:54.329 --> 29:58.626
And yet today, when Kenji mentioned
the comfort he got from vengeance...

30:00.104 --> 30:02.239
I wanted nothing more
than to be Yakuza myself.

30:05.758 --> 30:07.438
Wouldn't that be easier?

30:10.178 --> 30:12.947
If all it took to
feel better was to know

30:12.972 --> 30:16.908
the man who killed my father is dead?

30:21.635 --> 30:24.962
Tamiko, how well do you
know your father's men?

30:31.029 --> 30:32.897
Okay, ATF's been notified.

30:32.922 --> 30:34.122
They have a crew on the way.

30:34.147 --> 30:35.848
Also, HPD found a chain link fence

30:35.873 --> 30:37.307
on the west side of the property.

30:37.314 --> 30:38.748
It's been cut, top to bottom.

30:38.816 --> 30:40.469
I mean, from infil to exfil,

30:40.494 --> 30:42.862
this was an extremely
well-orchestrated operation.

30:42.887 --> 30:44.354
- Mm-hmm.
- Not one shot

30:44.379 --> 30:47.114
was fired in defense,
and no alarms were raised.

30:47.139 --> 30:48.550
Yeah, they were not only
good. They were prepared.

30:48.575 --> 30:51.280
Exactly. They also used
our helicopter pilot, Natua,

30:51.305 --> 30:52.738
to recon the grounds, right?

30:52.763 --> 30:54.464
Get a layout of all the terrain,

30:54.489 --> 30:56.329
look at how many security
personnel there were,

30:56.354 --> 30:57.755
- their locations.
- Right.

30:57.780 --> 30:59.011
Then Natua catches on,

30:59.036 --> 31:00.456
he realizes what he's involved in.

31:00.481 --> 31:02.515
That's probably why he
beefed up his home security.

31:02.540 --> 31:04.017
Yeah, figured that crew
was gonna come after him.

31:04.041 --> 31:05.227
And that they did,

31:05.252 --> 31:07.019
with a rocket launcher, no less.

31:07.044 --> 31:09.071
- Yeah.
- Problem solved.

31:09.462 --> 31:10.980
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey.

31:11.005 --> 31:12.567
So, we just ID'd our dead homeowner.

31:12.592 --> 31:13.859
His name is Jon Tang.

31:13.884 --> 31:15.703
He's a known associate of Wo Fat.

31:15.728 --> 31:19.064
ATF could never get a bead on
his location, but they suspected

31:19.089 --> 31:22.158
- that he inherited Wo Fat's arsenal.
- Arsenal.

31:22.225 --> 31:23.536
"Arsenal" is putting it lightly, man.

31:23.561 --> 31:24.912
What we saw in that basement...

31:24.937 --> 31:26.972
This guy had fully-automatic rifles

31:26.997 --> 31:28.283
and short-range missiles

31:28.308 --> 31:30.042
in those crates, along with the MANPADS.

31:30.067 --> 31:31.401
Right, so the crew came in

31:31.426 --> 31:33.360
using deadly force, and
they left with even more.

31:33.471 --> 31:34.871
- Yeah.
- Steve?

31:34.981 --> 31:36.882
- Huh?
- Check this out.

31:36.907 --> 31:38.842
Excuse me.

31:40.316 --> 31:43.004
All right, so CSU accessed
the feed from last night.

31:43.029 --> 31:44.997
Go ahead. Pull it up.

31:49.534 --> 31:52.355
I mean... look at that.

31:52.380 --> 31:54.181
That's surgical precision.

31:54.334 --> 31:56.135
These guys didn't come
here to make mistakes.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.161
Uh-uh. Check this out.

31:58.229 --> 31:59.229
Go ahead.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.755
See? Bad habits. They
get you every time.

32:05.295 --> 32:06.369
Freeze that frame.

32:06.437 --> 32:07.904
I've seen that guy before.

32:08.404 --> 32:09.482
What are you talking about?

32:09.507 --> 32:11.325
I was at the station today pumping gas,

32:11.350 --> 32:13.285
and I struck a conversation
with this woman,

32:13.353 --> 32:15.317
- and he was driving her SUV.
- That guy?

32:15.342 --> 32:16.848
- There's no way.
- Yeah. A hundred percent sure.

32:16.873 --> 32:18.432
This just happened a couple hours ago.

32:18.457 --> 32:19.758
Oh, it can't be a coincidence.

32:19.783 --> 32:21.484
We got to find out who this guy is.

32:29.139 --> 32:32.244
Hi. I called ahead about
the Japanese blended whiskey.

32:32.269 --> 32:33.469
The 18-year.

32:51.525 --> 32:52.992
That's him right there.

32:53.017 --> 32:55.218
Me and that lady talked
about cars, that's it.

32:55.243 --> 32:56.521
They seemed harmless.

32:56.546 --> 32:58.614
I grabbed a couple of
frames of this footage

32:58.639 --> 33:00.142
and ran 'em both through facial rec.

33:00.167 --> 33:02.535
Now, there was nothing on
the guy with the braids,

33:02.560 --> 33:04.309
but that lady right there,

33:04.334 --> 33:06.438
she returned an Interpol Red Notice.

33:06.857 --> 33:11.004
Her name is Daiyu Mei. She
escaped a Chinese prison.

33:11.029 --> 33:13.928
Anybody want to take a stab
at what she was doing time for?

33:13.953 --> 33:15.338
Trafficking illegal weapons.

33:15.363 --> 33:16.782
Exactly. I submitted a request

33:16.807 --> 33:18.584
for her file.

33:19.310 --> 33:21.544
- Classified.
- Well, at least we know

33:21.569 --> 33:23.081
who's behind the heist at Tang Mansion.

33:23.106 --> 33:26.508
Yeah. But why was she so
interested in talking to Junior?

33:33.457 --> 33:35.124
That was our friend at Interpol.

33:35.192 --> 33:36.993
There's been a request for your records.

33:37.201 --> 33:39.022
It came from Five-O.

33:39.119 --> 33:41.771
Then there's no room
for error from here on.

33:45.342 --> 33:48.011
Yes, ma'am. Thank you very much. Bye.

33:48.036 --> 33:50.189
- What's happening?
- Governor's up to speed.

33:50.214 --> 33:52.281
She's not exactly thrilled
this amount of firepower

33:52.306 --> 33:53.540
is about to hit the streets.

33:53.565 --> 33:54.927
All right, well, we're still waiting

33:54.952 --> 33:56.953
on Interpol to send
over Daiyu Mei's file.

33:56.978 --> 33:58.088
In the meantime, we got a BOLO out.

33:58.249 --> 33:59.749
All right.

34:01.534 --> 34:03.068
Are you expecting him?

34:03.093 --> 34:05.161
No.

34:08.574 --> 34:10.225
Hey, Duke, what's going on?

34:10.250 --> 34:13.902
Just got word. Hajime Masuda is dead.

34:13.928 --> 34:15.850
What? How'd that happen?

34:15.875 --> 34:18.621
O.C. got reports that he
had a stroke last night.

34:18.647 --> 34:19.985
Yeah, 'cause most Yakuza bosses

34:20.010 --> 34:22.311
die from natural causes, like a stroke.

34:22.335 --> 34:24.900
- I don't think so.
- There's more, though.

34:24.925 --> 34:27.426
Adam Noshimuri has been
seen coming and going

34:27.451 --> 34:29.318
- from the Masuda residence.
- Right.

34:29.342 --> 34:31.362
That-that makes sense
because Adam's girlfriend

34:31.388 --> 34:33.489
is Masuda's daughter.

34:33.521 --> 34:35.722
Duke, y-you're aware of
that. You know that. Steve.

34:35.826 --> 34:38.094
Yeah? Maybe this is why

34:38.119 --> 34:40.286
Adam quit. Right?

34:40.311 --> 34:43.467
Tamiko just lost her father.
She-She-She's nervous.

34:43.492 --> 34:45.887
We do a dangerous job.
She doesn't want Adam to get hurt.

34:45.911 --> 34:47.685
She asks him to quit.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.405
Okay, even if that's
the case, why wouldn't he

34:49.429 --> 34:51.435
just tell us the old man's dead?

34:54.411 --> 34:57.056
You know, your father
predicted this moment.

34:57.498 --> 34:58.915
What do you mean?

35:02.486 --> 35:04.687
I told him I'd arrest him one day.

35:04.833 --> 35:06.765
He had a good laugh at that.

35:07.391 --> 35:10.804
He said, uh, I wasn't fooling
him, wearing that badge.

35:11.648 --> 35:14.601
That I couldn't escape
where I come from or...

35:16.055 --> 35:17.531
who I am.

35:22.205 --> 35:23.984
I guess he was right.

35:29.211 --> 35:31.112
Are you sure you want to do this?

35:35.872 --> 35:38.419
Noshimuri, they're ready for you.

36:09.422 --> 36:13.905
So, there's no real news as far
as how she got onto the Island,

36:13.930 --> 36:16.001
but we got some info from Interpol

36:16.069 --> 36:17.970
on our suspect Daiyu Mei.

36:17.995 --> 36:21.264
Including four different aliases
that she's been known to use.

36:21.649 --> 36:23.475
One of which has her home address

36:23.500 --> 36:24.834
in Central Florida.

36:24.859 --> 36:26.359
Now, that Florida address

36:26.384 --> 36:28.235
also appears

36:28.260 --> 36:29.836
in these articles of incorporation

36:29.861 --> 36:31.061
for a shell company.

36:31.540 --> 36:33.209
One that leases a storage building

36:33.277 --> 36:34.377
right here on the Island.

36:34.402 --> 36:35.754
Sounds like the kind
of place you could store

36:35.779 --> 36:37.280
some stolen weapons, doesn't it?

36:37.347 --> 36:38.915
Let's go.

36:42.352 --> 36:46.525
I need SWAT and air
support to 1408 Whitman Street.

36:48.425 --> 36:50.713
Gentlemen, right on time.

36:57.526 --> 36:59.963
This is Air Three. We're en route.

37:01.581 --> 37:02.848
Excellent.

37:02.873 --> 37:04.473
If you don't mind,

37:05.072 --> 37:07.474
I'd like to see what I'm buying.

37:08.278 --> 37:09.517
Of course.

37:19.377 --> 37:21.424
The BGM-71 TOW.

37:21.752 --> 37:24.303
Impressively destructive
for its small size.

37:24.371 --> 37:26.995
The Stinger, which my colleague here

37:27.020 --> 37:29.799
can attest to its effectiveness.

37:29.824 --> 37:31.125
All right, let's move out.

37:31.150 --> 37:33.384
Move, move. Come on.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.052
And the M4.

37:37.677 --> 37:40.034
Fires up to 950 rounds per minute.

37:40.059 --> 37:43.190
Improved ergonomic
efficiency over the M16.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.921
And remarkably easy to load.

37:48.499 --> 37:49.652
How about a demonstration?

37:49.677 --> 37:51.177
Run! Run!

38:24.254 --> 38:25.721
Clear.

38:26.897 --> 38:29.507
- I'm not seeing any weapons.
- Yeah, it's clear.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.313
That's a lot of
surveillance for an empty warehouse,

38:40.338 --> 38:42.239
wouldn't you say?

38:42.349 --> 38:44.750
Well, I guess now she
knows we're onto her.

38:44.775 --> 38:46.095
Gee, I bet that's what she wanted.

38:46.185 --> 38:48.538
Yep. That's why she kept
her name on this building.

38:48.563 --> 38:51.080
That's why she wanted
Junior to see her face.

38:51.105 --> 38:53.148
She's been one step ahead
of us the whole time.

38:58.346 --> 39:01.799
Hmm, you've sustained
a bullet to the lung.

39:01.824 --> 39:03.524
Maybe more than one.

39:04.041 --> 39:05.570
If you don't get medical attention

39:05.595 --> 39:07.479
in the next 15 minutes, you'll die.

39:07.798 --> 39:09.869
I'd be happy to call
an ambulance for you,

39:10.214 --> 39:12.348
if you can agree to do me one favor.

39:14.104 --> 39:15.504
When they arrive,

39:15.768 --> 39:18.752
tell the policemen you have
a message for Steve McGarrett.

39:19.176 --> 39:20.588
Can you remember that?

39:20.742 --> 39:22.314
It's very important you remember.

39:25.089 --> 39:27.257
Tell him my name is Daiyu Mei.

39:27.774 --> 39:28.908
He might not know me,

39:29.129 --> 39:31.296
but he'll be familiar
with my late husband,

39:31.713 --> 39:33.713
Wo Fat.

39:38.684 --> 39:41.586
Tell him I look forward
to meeting him soon.
