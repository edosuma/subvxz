00:06.297 --> 00:08.299
THIS SERIES IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

00:08.383 --> 00:11.720
BUT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES

00:16.182 --> 00:18.935
SURINAME BORDER

00:56.389 --> 00:58.433
<i>Have you ever heard of Suriname?</i>

00:58.516 --> 00:59.976
<i>My guess is you haven't.</i>

01:00.477 --> 01:03.104
<i>It's a country in South America,</i>
<i>just above Brazil,</i>

01:03.188 --> 01:05.607
<i>with a population of about 500,000 people.</i>

01:06.232 --> 01:08.234
<i>Half of the country is covered in jungle,</i>

01:08.318 --> 01:11.696
<i>and over half the population</i>
<i>is involved in the drug trade.</i>

01:11.780 --> 01:14.741
<i>It's ethnically diverse and multilingual.</i>

01:15.366 --> 01:18.161
<i>What's a Korean guy like me</i>
<i>doing in a place like this?</i>

01:18.244 --> 01:20.997
<i>What I'm about to tell you</i>
<i>should answer that question.</i>

01:24.125 --> 01:25.752
<i>You may find it hard to believe,</i>

01:25.835 --> 01:29.839
<i>but everything I'm about to tell you</i>
<i>is true and actually happened to me.</i>

01:29.923 --> 01:32.425
<i>Some parts are so far-fetched</i>
<i>you'll think I'm making it up.</i>

01:32.509 --> 01:33.510
<i>And I wish I were.</i>

01:33.593 --> 01:37.055
<i>But the only way you'll know for sure</i>
<i>is to hold on tight and listen.</i>

02:40.618 --> 02:43.037
<i>In 1968, the year I was born,</i>

02:43.121 --> 02:46.040
<i>my father signed up</i>
<i>to fight in the Vietnam War.</i>

02:46.124 --> 02:49.210
<i>For five long years,</i>
<i>he fought to survive in the jungle.</i>

02:49.294 --> 02:53.006
<i>He came home when the American troops</i>
<i>withdrew, and the war finally ended.</i>

02:53.089 --> 02:53.965
DONGDUCHEON, KOREA

02:54.048 --> 02:56.301
<i>My father returned to us</i>
<i>tired and limping,</i>

02:56.384 --> 02:57.969
<i>but mostly in one piece.</i>

03:06.102 --> 03:07.395
<i>The day after he arrived,</i>

03:07.478 --> 03:10.273
<i>he was right back out the door</i>
<i>looking for work.</i>

03:13.443 --> 03:16.362
<i>And the only picture we had</i>
<i>where you can clearly see his face,</i>

03:16.446 --> 03:18.489
<i>my father was holding a huge gun.</i>

03:18.990 --> 03:21.826
<i>I always wondered why he'd gone away</i>
<i>to that far-off country,</i>

03:21.910 --> 03:23.703
<i>and why he needed that gun,</i>

03:23.786 --> 03:26.539
<i>but for some reason,</i>
<i>I was too scared to ask.</i>

03:26.623 --> 03:30.043
<i>It would take me 30 years</i>
<i>to understand what drove my father to go.</i>

03:31.461 --> 03:34.422
<i>When I got into middle school,</i>
<i>a teacher suggested I try judo.</i>

03:34.505 --> 03:35.548
<i>And I took him up on it.</i>

03:37.217 --> 03:41.262
<i>Being on the judo team meant I didn't</i>
<i>have to pay for school expenses or meals.</i>

03:45.225 --> 03:46.726
Control the legs. Legs!

03:48.394 --> 03:49.395
There you go.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.150
<i>At 14, I started my training.</i>

03:54.234 --> 03:55.360
Kang Ingu!

03:57.487 --> 03:58.905
<i>And I lost my mother.</i>

04:00.531 --> 04:02.533
<i>She was delivering yakult</i>
<i>at the crack of dawn</i>

04:02.617 --> 04:05.078
<i>in the middle of winter,</i>
<i>and she collapsed.</i>

04:05.787 --> 04:08.081
<i>It took three hours</i>
<i>for anyone to find her.</i>

04:21.511 --> 04:24.722
<i>My brother, my sister, and I</i>
<i>all cried our hearts out,</i>

04:24.806 --> 04:27.267
<i>but my father never shed a single tear.</i>

04:27.350 --> 04:29.852
<i>He just kept pouring soju down his throat</i>

04:29.936 --> 04:33.022
<i>between bite after bite</i>
<i>of fermented skate.</i>

04:33.523 --> 04:35.066
<i>It was his favorite meal.</i>

04:35.149 --> 04:37.151
<i>One of the few things in life</i>
<i>he ever enjoyed.</i>

04:51.416 --> 04:54.294
<i>My father drove a cement truck</i>
<i>to make ends meet.</i>

05:03.261 --> 05:05.805
<i>For six years,</i>
<i>he worked himself to the bone.</i>

05:05.888 --> 05:07.515
<i>Twenty hours a day.</i>

05:09.642 --> 05:12.562
<i>Until one night,</i>
<i>all those hours caught up to him.</i>

05:26.034 --> 05:27.118
<i>At his funeral,</i>

05:27.201 --> 05:31.164
<i>I finally understood why he'd never</i>
<i>been able to cry for our mother.</i>

05:32.206 --> 05:34.083
<i>Whatever sadness he felt and tears he had</i>

05:34.167 --> 05:37.253
<i>were buried under the harsh realities</i>
<i>of life and debt.</i>

05:43.217 --> 05:45.386
<i>It was up to me to support the family.</i>

05:45.470 --> 05:48.556
<i>During the day, I sold </i>makgeolli
<i>to hikers on Mount Soyosan.</i>

05:48.639 --> 05:50.933
Hi. Hi. Here you are, sir.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.687
<i>At night,</i>
<i>I was a waiter in a karaoke bar.</i>

05:59.067 --> 06:01.194
Whoo! Whoo!

06:02.111 --> 06:03.613
<i>Have a great night, sir.</i>

06:05.239 --> 06:06.074
I'm next!

06:06.157 --> 06:07.909
<i>It was hard work.</i>

06:08.493 --> 06:10.203
<i>But thanks to those experiences,</i>

06:10.286 --> 06:13.164
<i>I learned the life lessons</i>
<i>they don't teach you in school.</i>

06:14.749 --> 06:15.875
Thank you, sir.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.086
I wish you good health and a long life.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.254
PLEASE DON'T PARK HERE

06:28.721 --> 06:33.226
<i>Since I was out working so much,</i>
<i>the house was always a complete mess.</i>

06:36.646 --> 06:39.524
<i>You were supposed</i>
<i>to do the dishes. Christ.</i>

06:39.607 --> 06:41.859
<i> I knew I couldn't do it</i>
<i>all on my own,</i>

06:41.943 --> 06:45.279
<i>so I started making calls</i>
<i>to some of the girls who used to like me.</i>

06:45.988 --> 06:48.157
Hey, how are you? This is Ingu.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.245
Uh, I want to run something by you.

06:53.037 --> 06:53.871
Umâ€¦

06:54.789 --> 06:56.874
Do you want to get married?

06:56.958 --> 06:58.543
I swear I'm not drunk!

06:59.544 --> 07:02.672
It took all my nerve to call you.
I'm dead serious.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.257
Money?

07:04.966 --> 07:07.218
I mean, money's something
that'll come along.

07:07.301 --> 07:10.972
It's like our parents used to say,
"Work hard and save for the future."

07:11.055 --> 07:12.181
Sure.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.183
I mean it.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.270
If we get married and save money,
eventually we might get a house.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.272
What's with all these questions?

07:22.859 --> 07:24.444
An apartment?

07:25.027 --> 07:27.363
Hey, this isn't some sort
of business proposal.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.033
You know what? Forget I ever called.
I can tell you're just in it for yourself.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.829
<i>Who knew so many girls</i>
<i>would be surprised by a phone proposal?</i>

07:35.329 --> 07:39.250
<i>But finally, one girl said "yes,"</i>
<i>packed her bag, and moved in.</i>

07:48.551 --> 07:49.427
Oh.

07:52.638 --> 07:55.558
<i>This time,</i>
<i>I was the one who was surprised.</i>

08:02.356 --> 08:04.859
<i>My wife definitely made</i>
<i>our lives more stable.</i>

08:04.942 --> 08:08.946
<i>And once my brother and sister graduated</i>
<i>from high school, life eased up a bit.</i>

08:12.742 --> 08:16.829
<i>Then we decided to have kids of our own.</i>
<i>And my son and daughter were born.</i>

08:26.923 --> 08:28.591
<i>But with two more mouths to feed,</i>

08:28.674 --> 08:31.385
<i>just getting by</i>
<i>wasn't going to cut it anymore.</i>

08:34.096 --> 08:35.556
<i>So I learned to fix cars</i>

08:35.640 --> 08:38.976
<i>and opened a garage right next</i>
<i>to the US Army Base in Dongducheon.</i>

08:39.060 --> 08:40.394
-Hi, how are you?
-Hi there.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.063
-Good afternoon.
-Hey.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.774
<i>Thanks to a contact</i>
<i>through one of my judo buddies,</i>

08:44.857 --> 08:47.443
<i>I made extra money delivering food</i>
<i>to the army base.</i>

08:47.527 --> 08:50.321
<i>And so I learned to make nice</i>
<i>with the American grass.</i>

08:51.113 --> 08:53.616
-How are you?
-Well, it's my man, Ingu.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.409
You're looking particularly fit.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.369
And healthy.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.829
Because my garlic makes your blood clean.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.875
Well, that's bullshit.

09:02.959 --> 09:07.171
But I'll admit, for the price,
your garlic is pretty damn good.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.799
So, buy my onions too.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.802
I'll give you a very, very good price.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.137
Come for karaoke, and we'll talk. Okay?

09:23.271 --> 09:25.690
<i>At the karaoke bar,</i>
<i>I kept moving my way up.</i>

09:25.773 --> 09:27.108
<i>I eventually became manager.</i>

09:27.191 --> 09:29.026
<i>And when I had enough money,</i>
<i>I bought the place.</i>

09:30.695 --> 09:32.780
-Whoa!
-Wow!

09:32.863 --> 09:35.616
<i>Finally, even though</i>
<i>I had to take out a loan to secure it,</i>

09:35.700 --> 09:37.243
<i>we got a home of our own.</i>

09:38.786 --> 09:42.373
4TH GRADE - KOREAN FINAL EXAMS
KANG HYUNGJU 100/100

09:43.207 --> 09:45.251
<i>My son was smart and did well in school.</i>

09:45.876 --> 09:47.128
<i>He motivated me to keep working.</i>

09:47.211 --> 09:48.796
-Daddy!
-Hey.

09:48.879 --> 09:51.173
Can you take me
to the karaoke with you soon?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.842
I'm afraid not.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.512
We've been over this before.
It's for American soldiers only.

09:59.557 --> 10:02.977
<i>I hoped the rest of my life</i>
<i>would be smooth sailing.</i>

10:05.187 --> 10:06.647
<i>But I wasn't sure how much longer</i>

10:06.731 --> 10:09.233
<i>I'd be able to keep up</i>
<i>the exhausting pace.</i>

10:33.841 --> 10:36.927
<i>Sometimes the weight of it all</i>
<i>was almost unbearable.</i>

10:40.222 --> 10:41.515
Why are you threatening her?

10:49.357 --> 10:52.193
<i>I was living</i>
<i>just like my mother and father had.</i>

10:52.276 --> 10:54.862
<i>They never had a chance</i>
<i>to take their kids out for a nice meal.</i>

10:54.945 --> 10:57.573
<i>All they did was struggle</i>
<i>to make ends meet</i>

10:57.657 --> 10:59.867
<i>until they got worn out and died.</i>

11:01.702 --> 11:04.497
<i>What's the point of living</i>
<i>if you're barely surviving?</i>

11:05.831 --> 11:09.877
<i>I didn't want my kids living their lives</i>
<i>the way I did. I wanted better for them.</i>

11:10.419 --> 11:12.004
<i>Something had to change.</i>

11:14.423 --> 11:16.258
JOB OPENINGS

11:18.678 --> 11:20.054
So what do we got?

11:23.349 --> 11:24.600
Ingu!

11:25.226 --> 11:26.686
Look who's here.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.606
My first stop back from my travels
and that's all you can say?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.651
You filthy bastard.

11:33.734 --> 11:37.113
Didn't customs ask you
what the hell you have all over your hair?

11:37.196 --> 11:38.781
What are you using? Fish paste?

11:38.864 --> 11:41.283
Ingu, what the hell
would a punk mechanic know

11:41.367 --> 11:43.035
about anything outside this shithole?

11:43.119 --> 11:45.955
This, my friend,
is all the rage in Shinjuku right now.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.916
Here. Souvenirs for the wife and kids.

11:53.587 --> 11:54.839
Eungsoo,

11:55.881 --> 11:57.466
I'm keeping these for the shop.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.719
I'm always running out of rags.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.263
-Thanks.
-Funny. You have no idea what's in there.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.723
Good thing your wife has taste.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.142
She'll take one look
and wonder how she got so lucky.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.686
Now make yourself useful
and get these kinks out of my neck.

12:08.769 --> 12:09.645
Sure.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.190
-I'm always happy to help an old lady.
-What?

12:13.274 --> 12:15.109
Here. Like this?

12:15.192 --> 12:17.611
-Get out of Eungsoo's body, grandma!
-Okay! Shit! Hey, man!

12:17.695 --> 12:20.072
-Give me my strength back!
-Stop!

12:20.156 --> 12:21.699
-How does that feel? Better?
-Ow!

12:21.782 --> 12:24.577
<i>Samhap</i> for you.
Let me know how you like it.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.163
-Everything all right here, sir?
-A bit more soup, please.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.497
After ninth grade,

12:28.581 --> 12:32.001
when my dad passed away
and things got hard for us,

12:32.084 --> 12:34.170
I couldn't afford school, so I quit.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.172
You didn't quit.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.549
They kicked you out.
Before you flunked out.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.429
And then,
I went to work in the real world.

12:43.512 --> 12:46.557
Ended up on boats working my ass off
for the last 20 years,

12:46.640 --> 12:49.018
and still hardly able to feed my family.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.895
It's the same for you. Isn't it?

12:51.479 --> 12:52.980
We come from the same place,

12:53.063 --> 12:55.274
we both done shit jobs, right?

12:55.816 --> 12:57.818
That's how the world works, Eungsoo.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.361
We were born into it.

12:59.862 --> 13:03.324
Listen to you.
I recall when you had to quit judo.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.410
You told me
you would do something different,

13:06.494 --> 13:08.245
or your life would be shit.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.163
Huh?

13:09.246 --> 13:11.874
Now that you've been working
like an animal all these years,

13:11.957 --> 13:13.125
what's changed?

13:13.209 --> 13:15.127
I'm a homeowner with a family, dumbass.

13:15.711 --> 13:18.881
Who you calling dumbass, huh?
The interest on the loan is killing you.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.675
The bank owns your home, not you.

13:22.176 --> 13:25.888
You know, we're gonna work ourselves
to death if things go on.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.431
Just like our parents before us.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.975
Dead. With nothing to show for it.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.311
Why do I get the feeling
you're buttering me up?

13:32.394 --> 13:34.396
Whatever it is, spit it out.

13:36.148 --> 13:40.528
The skate you're chewing so loudly,
it doesn't come from Korea.

13:40.611 --> 13:44.156
It comes from Chile. Ninety percent of it.
But it gets labeled as local.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.450
They charge a fortune for this bullshit.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.037
Even the ones form Chile
are going for crazy prices these days.

13:50.621 --> 13:53.123
I'm not following.
Why you talking about skate?

13:54.542 --> 13:55.626
Inguâ€¦

13:56.585 --> 13:59.338
If I told you
I could harvest skate for free

13:59.421 --> 14:02.299
and bring it back here to sell
at local rates, what would you say?

14:02.383 --> 14:03.342
Bull.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.678
If it were that easy,
there'd be someone doing it.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.388
Nothing comes free. You know that.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.307
Why would someone give you skate for free?
It'd be like printing money.

14:10.391 --> 14:13.394
I traveled to a place
where they just toss the skate they catch.

14:13.477 --> 14:14.687
They don't like it.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.148
And only I know. It's my secret.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.861
Does "Suriname" ring any bells?

14:21.944 --> 14:24.363
Suriname? Never heard of it.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.740
I was hoping you would say that.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.242
See, in 20 years of sailing,

14:28.325 --> 14:31.370
I set foot there
for the first time this year.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.252
Here. I'll show you.

14:38.335 --> 14:41.672
It's in South America north of Brazil.
Tiny. With half a million people.

14:41.755 --> 14:44.550
The fishing waters all along the coast
are full of skate.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.428
They catch them with the fish they want.

14:47.511 --> 14:51.473
They don't like it because it's ugly
and smells so bad, so they just toss it.

14:52.099 --> 14:55.895
I asked this guy,
the chief of the fishing village.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.063
I asked if he'd let me have the skate.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.108
He said yes. For a few cents each.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.444
Do you know what we'd get
if we sold it here?

15:06.655 --> 15:07.656
Is this for real?

15:07.740 --> 15:10.492
Do you have to taste test
to see if it's chocolate or shit?

15:10.576 --> 15:12.369
Come to Suriname with me and find out.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.373
<i>You gonna give it to me?</i>
<i>Okay. I'll take one for free then.</i>

15:21.795 --> 15:24.840
What for?
It's just a crazy idea Eungsoo had.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.843
If it were in the United States, maybe,
but Suriname?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.762
I never even heard of it until today.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.056
That's why it works. Listen.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.934
South America and Asia
are on opposite sides of the world.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.894
Plenty of information
falls between the cracks.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.062
Even nowadays.

15:38.145 --> 15:41.065
That's why we got lucky with this.
Come on. This is our chance.

15:41.148 --> 15:43.901
I know Eungsoo is a good guyâ€¦

15:46.278 --> 15:48.447
but how can you trust someone
with such lousy taste?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.408
I don't trust his taste
any more than you do,

15:51.492 --> 15:52.910
but he knows fishing.

15:52.993 --> 15:56.038
I looked into it just to be sure
and he's on to something.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.248
It's actually true. Really.

15:58.332 --> 16:01.210
The Surinamese people
eat a lot of fish, but not skate.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.088
I got this from Yongtaek
at the fish market today.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.047
Take a look.

16:05.547 --> 16:06.882
Have a seat. Come on.

16:07.466 --> 16:11.011
Chilean skate usually goes
for 30,000 won a piece at wholesale. See?

16:11.720 --> 16:15.349
But since there's been a lack of supply,
it's going to skyrocket.

16:15.432 --> 16:18.268
If we bring in the skate
that we get for a few cents

16:18.352 --> 16:19.979
and sell it at market here,

16:20.729 --> 16:22.398
it'll change our lives.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.319
It's too much.

16:27.861 --> 16:30.572
You would be halfway around the world,
and the business would be gone.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.660
Ingu, family needs to be together.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.413
You need to come home
and have dinner with us.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.665
This plan isn't for you.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.625
We need to thank God
for the life we have, honey.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.005
You know I'm thankful for it, Hyejin.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.507
I want to show more thanks
by being successful.

16:49.758 --> 16:53.345
If we can get this going,
10 billion won will be pocket change.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.222
Money isn't everything, dear.

16:55.931 --> 16:59.143
I'd rather be poor
than have our kids be without a dad.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.106
How long can we live like this, though?

17:05.524 --> 17:06.859
What do you mean by that?

17:18.203 --> 17:21.290
One for you, one for you,
one for you, one for you.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.007
Two hundred thousand.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.302
All right. Must be a weak hand.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.720
Seven hundred thousand.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.056
Oh, look at you.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.475
Raising the stakes
to try and get a big win.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.976
You think you can price us out?

17:41.060 --> 17:44.271
Or are you trying to make
your yearly sales in one shot?

17:44.354 --> 17:47.941
Whatever it is, the ante has just gone up
due to inflation.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.610
The tax man cometh.

17:50.110 --> 17:50.944
-Ready?
-Come on.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.279
I don't like your system, Ingu.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.364
You don't bet anything,
and you still get a huge cut.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.492
You take money
for the house and the dealer.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.744
You're the only one
who ends up winning here.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.371
Hey, if you factor in rent
and employee salaries,

18:01.455 --> 18:03.248
I barely cover expenses.
You believe this guy?

18:03.332 --> 18:06.585
Just saying you were so quick
to jump on our cash is all.

18:06.668 --> 18:09.838
We all know small change
can add up to a fortune eventually.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.382
Next thing you know,
you'll say I hurt your feelings.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.552
Shit.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.224
I call.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.060
Too rich for me.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.104
Let's see if I'm helping you
make your sales quota.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.523
Show me. Come on.
Pair of aces, isn't it?

18:27.606 --> 18:30.692
A pair of aces
wouldn't put this smile on my face.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.777
Ah!

18:31.860 --> 18:34.113
Very, very sorry.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.989
Broadway straight.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.449
-Damn.
-Whoa!

18:37.533 --> 18:40.285
Wow, you made it all the way to Broadway.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.787
That's tough to beat.

18:41.870 --> 18:45.374
Hold on.
The queen has something to say.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.917
What is that?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.961
I heard you had a slow day.
So I know this hurts.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.504
I really thought you had him there.

18:50.587 --> 18:54.550
Now you know why you got lucky enough
to beat a Broadway straight?

18:54.633 --> 18:56.718
-Because you paid your taxes, sir.
-Mm-hmm.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.554
Model citizens always get rewarded.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.598
I guess your taxes brought me luck.
For the tip jar.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.725
I promise to use it wisely.
Thank you, sir.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.727
-Could I get some?
-Sure. When you win.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.647
Sorry to interrupt.
We have a DEFCON three, sir.

19:09.940 --> 19:10.774
Huh.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.069
Deal the cards, would you?
I'll be right back. Dammit.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.742
Excuse me.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.329
Okay.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.751
Would you go wait outside, ladies?

19:30.294 --> 19:32.379
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

19:32.462 --> 19:34.214
-Hey. Go get her.
-Huh?

19:34.298 --> 19:36.383
Here! Get back here!

19:36.466 --> 19:39.261
-Come here, come here, come here!
-Okay. I think we can let her go.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.679
Wait outside, please.

19:40.762 --> 19:41.638
Sir.

19:41.722 --> 19:44.433
Let the ladies go freshen up.
We'll just have a seat.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.520
Wow. You tough guys really went at it.
What a mess.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.565
Now, I'm sure the ladies feel bad
about all this.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.609
My apologies on their behalf.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.485
I'll make it up to you. All right?

19:55.569 --> 19:59.114
I'm sure we can agree that it's not good
to get angry after spending so much.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.115
You'll get ulcers.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.868
Here's what I'll do.
Tonight this bottle's on the house.

20:02.951 --> 20:06.205
And the ladies time
will only be charged at half price.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.498
The evening didn't go as you expected.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.752
So with all of that put together,

20:12.920 --> 20:14.296
1.2 million is fine.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.424
You gotta be kidding. Huh?

20:18.300 --> 20:20.928
You want me
to shut this place down for good?

20:21.720 --> 20:23.013
I'll pay nothing.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.265
You're the one who's gonna pay me!

20:25.766 --> 20:28.727
What are you gonna do
about fucking up my evening?

20:28.810 --> 20:31.063
Seriously?

20:31.146 --> 20:32.231
Gentleman,

20:32.898 --> 20:34.775
are you really going to do this?

20:34.858 --> 20:38.028
I hate calling the cops at this hour.
I really do.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.029
Listen.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.490
I'll take whatever you have on you, okay?

20:41.573 --> 20:44.326
Whatever cash you have right now,
I'll take it, and we'll call it even.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.414
Ah, shit.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.874
All I haveâ€¦

20:51.625 --> 20:53.377
â€¦is this.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.255
POLICE OFFICER
CHOI CHEOLYONG

20:59.049 --> 21:01.343
You have a license
to be running this joint?

21:01.927 --> 21:03.845
Any of those ladies of yours minors?

21:03.929 --> 21:08.016
Come on.
Why do you always have to be so nice, huh?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.142
Hey.

21:09.226 --> 21:13.063
Until you opened your big mouth,
we were just gonna let it slide.

21:13.146 --> 21:14.398
Asshole.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.149
I don't care if you have a license or not.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.486
As long as I'm at city hall,
you're closed for business.

21:22.656 --> 21:23.657
I should've known better.

21:24.491 --> 21:27.327
I hope we can all try
and forget the whole thing.

21:28.161 --> 21:31.164
I think this will cover
your taxi ride home.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.332
Gentleman.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.710
Ah, shit.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.420
Hey, you fucker!

21:37.421 --> 21:38.630
Come here.

21:38.714 --> 21:39.756
You think you can just--

21:39.840 --> 21:41.466
-Keep your hands off me!
-Huh?

21:41.550 --> 21:42.801
What? Come on!

21:42.884 --> 21:45.679
You want a piece of me, asshole? Huh?

21:45.762 --> 21:48.557
You think this is all about money, huh?

21:49.349 --> 21:50.475
Do you?

21:51.143 --> 21:53.687
You need to learn some respect,
you piece of shit!

21:55.105 --> 21:56.732
What the fuck?

21:57.316 --> 21:58.775
Come on, man. Get up.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.695
Crazy bastard! You're done!

22:02.362 --> 22:04.114
Hey, get up. Are you okay?

22:05.157 --> 22:06.158
Asshole!

22:12.956 --> 22:15.876
JOHAN ADOLF PENGEL
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, SURINAME

22:27.804 --> 22:29.306
Hey, buddy!

22:29.389 --> 22:32.601
-Welcome to Suriname!
-Ah!

22:41.026 --> 22:44.488
They gained independence
from the Netherlands over 30 years ago.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.365
There aren't a lot of people.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.241
There's always some kind
of labor shortage.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.993
That's why they let so many immigrants in.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.621
Technically,
the official language here is Dutch,

22:52.704 --> 22:54.122
but almost everyone speaks English.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.542
There's also Chinese, Spanish,
a few other languages. It's very diverse.

22:58.251 --> 23:00.670
Wow, Eungsoo. Memorize much?

23:00.754 --> 23:02.381
How long did that take you?

23:02.464 --> 23:05.300
I was busy scouting while you took
your sweet time getting here.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.426
Show some respect.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.344
Hey.

23:07.928 --> 23:11.473
You know during the Korean War
Suriname fought with the allied forces?

23:12.307 --> 23:14.684
Why would they
have been involved in the war?

23:15.268 --> 23:18.522
Eungsoo, are you done
playing tour guide now? Huh?

23:18.605 --> 23:22.359
You need to stop wasting time on trivia,
and focus on the reason we're here.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.403
Stick to what you know. Shipping and fish.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.947
I have everything
taken care of with the chief,

23:27.030 --> 23:28.824
so don't worry about the business.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.576
I liquidated everything I had.
Sold all my businesses

23:31.660 --> 23:34.871
to do this thing with a guy
who flunked out of school.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.790
Do you even own a calculator?

23:37.374 --> 23:39.668
I might've left school early,
but I have a head for numbers.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.795
I know for a fact
I was better at math than you.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.505
Are you drunk?

23:43.588 --> 23:45.173
Math was my strong suit.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.301
I distinctly remember
you being dead last in the rankings.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.762
Seven times eight?

23:52.139 --> 23:53.473
Oh, come on, Ingu.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.934
You don't know your times tables.
Admit it.

23:56.017 --> 23:59.020
The jet lag is really getting to you,
isn't it?

23:59.104 --> 24:02.482
Eungsoo, if you can't do the basics,
how do I trust your numbers?

24:03.066 --> 24:05.610
I'll add later.
I have to keep my eyes on the road.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.404
First of all, it's multiplication.

24:07.487 --> 24:10.073
And second, it should be automatic.
Come on.

24:11.491 --> 24:12.826
Driving's tricky here.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.537
I can only focus on one thing at a time.
Do you mind?

24:16.496 --> 24:18.582
You should be paying attention too, huh?

24:19.249 --> 24:20.792
I don't believe you.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.086
You don't know
what seven times eight is.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.011
Look.

24:31.094 --> 24:33.513
I got us one ton at a dollar per kilo.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.433
I told you. I been busy.

24:37.058 --> 24:39.603
Yeah. I take it back.
You have been busy, haven't you?

24:39.686 --> 24:40.979
Excellent work, partner.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.065
You got this for a dollar a kilo?

24:45.609 --> 24:47.194
Oh no. Why are you opening that?

24:47.277 --> 24:51.114
It still smells like shit
even when it's frozen.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.450
You want to know what I smell?
A ton of cash.

24:54.618 --> 24:55.535
Mmm.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.092
<i>It's safe there, right, honey?</i>

25:11.593 --> 25:13.887
<i>-Are you eating well? What about church?</i>
-Huh?

25:13.970 --> 25:15.931
No worries on the safety at all.

25:16.806 --> 25:19.935
And the food is amazing.
I think every country is represented.

25:20.018 --> 25:23.104
It's like an international food festival.
I wish you could see it.

25:25.774 --> 25:28.902
You didn't answer me about church.
You're going, aren't you?

25:28.985 --> 25:32.614
I've been trying to go since I got here.
It's just the roads get washed out a lot.

25:32.697 --> 25:36.159
<i>Between the jungle and the weather,</i>
<i>sometimes it's impossible to get there.</i>

25:36.243 --> 25:39.454
I agreed to let you go
if you promised to go to church, remember?

25:40.038 --> 25:41.998
There's actually a Korean church
where you are.

25:42.082 --> 25:45.418
I want you to send a picture from there
this Sunday, so I know you made it, okay?

25:45.502 --> 25:47.337
All right. I'll try to make it.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.633
I'll send you a picture. Promise.

25:52.300 --> 25:55.595
I really have to let you go,
or the phone bill's gonna be outrageous.

25:56.096 --> 25:56.930
Bye.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.725
Your wife nagging you?

26:00.809 --> 26:02.060
Is she busting your balls?

26:02.143 --> 26:04.104
She wants a picture of me at church.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.856
Ah, sucker!

26:06.940 --> 26:10.193
You told her you'd go
and she's holding you to it.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.570
You say your prayers every night?

26:11.653 --> 26:15.407
Lord, let your words reign
in our daily thoughts and lives.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.288
More ice. More!

26:24.541 --> 26:25.792
You missed a few!

26:34.050 --> 26:35.844
I want to see more!

26:42.809 --> 26:44.769
I want a box that's already full.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.534
Are you the owner
of this factory?

27:00.994 --> 27:02.370
Good afternoon, sir.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.539
I'm the CEO. Nice to meet you.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.586
You want to run business here?

27:10.086 --> 27:11.671
You're going to need my help.

27:12.464 --> 27:16.551
So many thieves
and criminals in this city.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.219
He might be one of them.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.014
You're with the army? Okay, good!

27:21.723 --> 27:23.892
The Suriname Allied Forces.

27:38.198 --> 27:41.701
We're starting our business,
so money's tight now.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.537
When our fish sells in Korea,
we'll have money.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.331
Then, we'll pay you.

27:46.414 --> 27:48.375
You understand? Very simple.

27:51.753 --> 27:54.255
Then pay us 2,000 a month.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.298
Got it?

27:57.008 --> 27:58.635
Bad idea. I don't think so.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.096
On a good month,

28:01.179 --> 28:04.015
if things go as planned
and we can sell our quota,

28:04.099 --> 28:06.351
we'll give you 2,500 dollars.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.270
But, if it's a bad month,

28:09.354 --> 28:11.564
if, for some reason,
the crap hits the fan,

28:11.648 --> 28:13.274
you get 1,000 dollars.

28:14.150 --> 28:18.405
Anyway, we can talk about standards
for good and bad months another time.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.281
Got it?

28:35.046 --> 28:36.506
This tastes really good.

28:37.424 --> 28:38.717
It's a new flavor.

28:42.595 --> 28:44.305
Is itâ€¦ Is it Colombian?

28:45.807 --> 28:49.018
No, that's Korea's traditional coffee.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.019
Really?

28:50.770 --> 28:53.982
It'sâ€¦ It's bitter, and sweet too.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.234
Yeah, like a woman.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.705
I think we're gonna get along just fine.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.755
Yeah. A little to the left.

29:17.255 --> 29:20.008
Okay, okay. That's it.
That's it, right? Right there.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.930
Since you enjoy our coffee,
these are for you.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.812
No one's going to bother you now.

29:32.896 --> 29:33.897
I promise.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.191
-Thank you, sir.
-Hey!

29:46.117 --> 29:47.368
Dollars make sense.

29:48.495 --> 29:49.788
We're good pals now.

29:50.789 --> 29:51.706
Thank you.

30:08.556 --> 30:10.016
Ugh. Let's go.

30:10.099 --> 30:11.893
Hey, Ingu,
that was something else.

30:11.976 --> 30:14.687
That karaoke bar
really taught you something.

30:14.771 --> 30:18.191
Hey, now that you negotiated protection
with the commander of the army,

30:18.274 --> 30:20.193
no one's gonna try messing with us, right?

30:20.276 --> 30:23.321
Are you that naive?
You should know better than that.

30:23.404 --> 30:27.909
Come on. Of all the people in the world,
you should never trust government workers.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.453
They just sit around
waiting for bribes. You know.

30:30.537 --> 30:33.289
Well, at least you didn't pull
your judo moves on this guy

30:33.373 --> 30:34.958
and almost get sent to jail again.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.836
They taught you a good lesson.

30:37.919 --> 30:38.753
Hold on.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.384
Yes, Mr. Shin. How are you, sir?
You got the shipment of skate?

30:45.510 --> 30:46.344
Yes.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.471
Sorry?

30:48.555 --> 30:50.807
Five hundred more kilos by next week?

30:51.599 --> 30:52.684
Nah. Can't do it.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.811
I don't think we can
get it to you by next week.

30:54.894 --> 30:57.105
Demand is through the roof right now.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.358
Really?

31:02.569 --> 31:04.529
All right. I'll see what I can do.

31:04.612 --> 31:07.824
I'll confirm soon.
There's a shipping schedule to consider.

31:08.449 --> 31:11.411
If you can wait til the 23rd,
then I'm certain we can do it.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.706
Yeah. Excellent, Mr. Shin.
Yeah, I will. Yeah.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.666
I told you to say no.

31:17.166 --> 31:21.045
We can't make deals that big on the fly.
I hardly get any sleep as it is.

31:22.213 --> 31:26.050
Shin is offering us 8,000 more
for each kilo we can get him

31:26.134 --> 31:28.344
by the 23rd, you lazy ass!

31:28.428 --> 31:31.097
I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead,
you crazy son of a bitch.

31:32.098 --> 31:33.683
Hey, get to work, guys. Come on!

31:33.766 --> 31:35.351
Get that truck loaded up! Let's go!

31:35.435 --> 31:37.312
Come on! What is this? Let's go!

31:37.395 --> 31:38.730
No work, no money.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.336
How's your new school, son?

32:01.419 --> 32:03.087
<i> It's a bit harder</i>
<i>for me right now</i>

32:03.171 --> 32:05.632
<i>because I have to catch up</i>
<i>to the other kids.</i>

32:05.715 --> 32:08.343
That'll pay off for you.
What's my saying about effort?

32:08.426 --> 32:11.220
Don't take the easy road.
Take the right road no matterâ€¦

32:11.304 --> 32:13.932
-<i>How long you travel.</i>
-That's right.

32:14.015 --> 32:17.685
The fact that your classes are hard now,
only means that things will get easier.

32:17.769 --> 32:18.728
Trust your dad on this.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.409
Hyungju, I'll call you back later, okay?
Have Mom check your homework.

32:38.331 --> 32:39.666
Hey, you okay?

32:39.749 --> 32:41.250
-He did it.
-Who?

32:44.754 --> 32:45.797
Oh!

32:51.970 --> 32:54.055
Come on.

32:56.849 --> 32:57.850
Yes?

32:59.185 --> 33:02.271
You're the guy who's shipping out
Suriname skate fish, huh?

33:02.939 --> 33:05.566
So, you have to pay me.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.778
What? Who are you?

33:10.071 --> 33:11.572
I made a deal with the soldiers.

33:14.158 --> 33:17.203
I am a businessman,
and I own the Suriname Sea.

33:17.286 --> 33:18.621
It'sâ€¦ it's all mine.

33:19.414 --> 33:23.334
I want 5,000 dollars a month
for those fish you're taking.

33:24.127 --> 33:24.961
Got it?

33:25.044 --> 33:27.088
Is this another shakedown?

33:27.171 --> 33:29.298
He's just a local thief.
Let's get out of here.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.883
-Okay.
-Hey!

33:30.967 --> 33:34.178
Where the fuck are you going?
The boss is talking to you.

33:35.388 --> 33:37.265
Oh shit!

33:46.232 --> 33:49.068
Okay, okay. What do you want?

33:49.652 --> 33:50.820
I told you.

33:51.404 --> 33:52.739
You have to pay.

34:01.330 --> 34:03.207
Step on him! Die!

34:03.291 --> 34:04.417
Die!

34:07.003 --> 34:08.087
Step on him!

34:10.256 --> 34:12.425
Stay still!

34:24.145 --> 34:25.104
Ah!

34:36.908 --> 34:39.494
Bring me 5,000 dollars a month.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.412
If you don't,

34:41.996 --> 34:43.539
I'll fucking kill you.

34:44.832 --> 34:45.875
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:48.294 --> 34:51.005
You're a businessman?
I'm a businessman too.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.924
Let's make deal. Huh?

34:55.635 --> 34:57.220
If we give you 5,000 this month,

34:57.804 --> 34:59.514
we're broke. Busted.

35:00.681 --> 35:04.477
Then, we can't pay you next month,
and so on. That's bad business.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.395
Bad for you and for me.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.356
Soâ€¦

35:09.690 --> 35:11.317
What I propose is better.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.903
Give us a discount to get started.

35:15.530 --> 35:16.364
Deal?

35:25.206 --> 35:26.666
No discount!

35:27.250 --> 35:29.127
Pay, or die.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.807
That's gotta hurt.

35:42.890 --> 35:45.935
No offense, but he's
a much better negotiator than you are.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.939
Hey, you don't know fuck all
about negotiating.

35:50.022 --> 35:53.025
You never give up. No matter what.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.995
IT MUST BE HARD OUT THERE FOR YOU.
THAT'S WHAT CHURCHES ARE FOR, RIGHT?

36:04.078 --> 36:05.454
I'LL BE WAITING FOR THE PICTURES.

36:07.456 --> 36:08.875
Ah shit.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.553
Let's get this over with.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.806
Hold on a second. Can you see the bruises?

37:05.890 --> 37:06.766
Mm-hmm.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.435
She'll be worried sick
if she sees those.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.395
Let's do something like this instead.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.775
-Let's see.
-How's this?

37:16.817 --> 37:19.070
It's too close.
We need to get more people in it.

37:19.153 --> 37:20.488
-I'll bow.
-I'll go a little wider.

37:20.571 --> 37:21.781
Try it again. Here.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.452
You look super pious in this one.

37:26.535 --> 37:28.621
Yeah. Good. Thanks.

37:35.670 --> 37:36.504
Ah.

37:37.546 --> 37:38.381
Mmm.

37:40.299 --> 37:42.677
As it was written
in the good book of Timothy,

37:42.760 --> 37:47.306
for we brought nothing into this world,

37:48.266 --> 37:49.850
and we can take nothing out of it.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.228
"We take nothing when we depart it."

37:52.311 --> 37:56.774
But if we have food
in our mouths and clothes on our backs,

37:56.857 --> 37:58.317
we will be content with that.

37:58.401 --> 38:00.069
Amen.

38:01.028 --> 38:05.199
The Lord has said,
that money is the root of all evil,

38:05.283 --> 38:07.076
and that those who covet it

38:07.159 --> 38:10.079
will have pierced themselves
with many sorrows.

38:10.162 --> 38:12.581
-They will have a glimpse of hell.
-Let's get out of here.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.502
Amen.

38:17.878 --> 38:19.714
Today, we have amongst our gathering

38:19.797 --> 38:22.508
two of our brethren
who have traveled far to be here.

38:22.591 --> 38:24.427
There. Near the doors.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.178
"We have our brothers

38:26.262 --> 38:28.681
who have come all the way here
to follow the words of Jesus."

38:29.932 --> 38:33.019
We welcome you to our church
and invite you to introduce yourselves.

38:33.102 --> 38:35.354
It's tradition.
Please give them a round of applause.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.815
"Let's give them a round of applause!"

38:49.076 --> 38:50.411
Uh, hallelujah.

38:50.911 --> 38:51.871
Uhâ€¦

38:51.954 --> 38:54.707
Hello, sisters and brothers.
I'm Kang Ingu from Dongducheon.

38:54.790 --> 38:57.877
I run a seafood export.
Thank you for the warm welcome.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.383
We sell skate fish.

39:04.467 --> 39:08.679
It's high in protein
and excellent for detox and digestion.

39:08.763 --> 39:11.515
For you, brothers and sisters,
we offer discounts.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.768
You can have all the skate you want
at our cost.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.437
Please feel free to pop down
to our warehouse. Okay?

39:20.983 --> 39:24.904
Beautiful.
Thank you for those very thoughtful words.

39:25.946 --> 39:29.408
And why don't we respond to them
with a warm hallelujah? Hallelujah!

39:29.492 --> 39:31.494
Hallelujah!

39:34.205 --> 39:35.206
Come in.

39:43.798 --> 39:49.178
So you take the local skate we fish here,
and sell it at market in Korea?

39:49.261 --> 39:51.055
That's a good use
of our resources. Brilliant.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.308
I have to say,
I don't like to discuss business here

39:54.392 --> 39:55.226
in the house of God

39:55.309 --> 39:56.477
Mm-mm.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.021
No, no, no. Don't be shy. God loves fish.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.732
One of my favorite proverbs is this,

40:01.816 --> 40:04.193
"A man diligent in his work
will stand before kings."

40:04.276 --> 40:06.153
"He will not stand before mean men."

40:06.237 --> 40:10.199
If you are sincere in your work,
God will bless your endeavor.

40:10.282 --> 40:11.283
Hmm.

40:11.367 --> 40:14.495
We try to make our Lord proud.

40:15.454 --> 40:17.998
I feel there's something
I must ask you, though.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.835
Are you troubled?

40:21.627 --> 40:23.587
Is there hardship facing your business?

40:23.671 --> 40:25.089
Your faces areâ€¦

40:27.258 --> 40:28.717
Oh, it's nothing.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.596
Just the usual bumps and bruises
from being new on the scene.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.098
It should all work itself out soon.

40:34.181 --> 40:35.683
Ah, I see.

40:36.475 --> 40:38.352
If you don't mind my asking, brother,

40:38.894 --> 40:41.313
who's involved
in this bumping and bruising, huh?

40:44.650 --> 40:45.734
Maybe we should tell him.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.571
Might not be good to get him involved.

40:51.073 --> 40:54.201
We have a deal
to buy local skate, you see?

40:54.285 --> 40:55.661
And some Chinese guy beat us up

40:55.744 --> 40:57.872
and said we owe him
because he owns the sea.

40:57.955 --> 41:00.791
We already had a deal for protection
with the commander,

41:00.875 --> 41:03.419
and now he says that only covers the land.

41:03.502 --> 41:05.463
Everyone wants a piece of our business.

41:12.553 --> 41:15.014
Uh, we shouldn't bother you
with our stories. Let's go.

41:15.097 --> 41:15.973
Yeah.

41:16.056 --> 41:19.685
Did this Chinese guy you mentioned
happen to have long hair?

41:20.519 --> 41:24.023
And did he look like he might think
personal hygiene's a thing of the past?

41:24.106 --> 41:26.233
Uh-huh. Do you know something about him?

41:30.362 --> 41:31.238
Yes.

41:31.989 --> 41:34.575
Chen Zhen is head of a Chinese gang.

41:34.658 --> 41:37.369
The type of man
who has no respect for human values.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.663
The spawn of the devil
who kills for money.

41:44.543 --> 41:45.377
Lordâ€¦

41:46.629 --> 41:48.923
is this too all part of your great plan?

41:54.678 --> 41:57.515
Seeing as our Lord has sent
two brothers here from my homeland,

41:57.598 --> 41:59.808
and allowed you
to share your burden with his servant,

41:59.892 --> 42:04.396
I humbly understand God asked me
to join you in your journey.

42:05.064 --> 42:08.651
It will test our spirit,
but God's will will prevail.

42:08.734 --> 42:10.778
Pastor, if you can fix this,

42:10.861 --> 42:13.155
I'll be glad to make
a significant donation.

42:13.239 --> 42:14.198
Brother Kang,

42:14.823 --> 42:17.785
money is of no concern to me
in this instance.

42:17.868 --> 42:21.914
I hear the call of God
bringing those in need to my door.

42:29.838 --> 42:31.799
Yes, this is Pastor Jeon.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.217
Get me the preacher.

42:33.926 --> 42:36.345
I need to make a visit to Chinatown.

42:39.265 --> 42:42.184
CHINATOWN, PARAMARIBO

43:42.119 --> 43:43.370
Welcome.

43:50.419 --> 43:51.378
Hmm.

43:58.761 --> 44:02.097
Idolatry is frowned upon
in my church highly,

44:02.181 --> 44:04.516
but it's lunchtime.

44:06.352 --> 44:07.853
Preacher, can you feed our guests?

44:08.437 --> 44:09.396
With pleasure.

44:10.105 --> 44:12.066
Lay out some hot pots
and <i>baijiu</i> on each of the tables.

44:12.149 --> 44:13.108
Yes, sir.

44:19.865 --> 44:21.408
Brother Kang.

44:22.326 --> 44:24.411
-Thank you.
-Brother Park.

44:24.495 --> 44:25.704
Here.

44:34.296 --> 44:37.049
Who's making all this noise
in my territory?

44:45.766 --> 44:47.768
Fucking fish man.

44:47.851 --> 44:48.686
This asshole?

44:49.478 --> 44:50.729
You brought the pastor here?

44:54.108 --> 44:55.317
Hey, Pastor.

44:56.151 --> 44:57.861
Why are you in my restaurant?

45:00.197 --> 45:01.490
Come, Preacher.

45:02.950 --> 45:06.328
I want to be understood
by this idol worshiper.

45:07.204 --> 45:10.374
I understand, Pastor.
I'll make sure he gets the message.

45:17.464 --> 45:19.842
Suriname's waters belong to God.

45:19.925 --> 45:22.469
All the skate in these waters
belong to God.

45:23.804 --> 45:25.764
Brothers Kang and Park here,

45:26.265 --> 45:27.891
were chosen by the grace of God

45:27.975 --> 45:30.102
to come to our bountiful land
to harvest skate.

45:30.185 --> 45:32.980
You do understand they're here for God.

45:35.441 --> 45:37.401
If you interfere with these men
and their mission,

45:37.484 --> 45:40.654
your actions will be judged by God
just as the Amalekites were.

45:41.363 --> 45:43.907
With the wrath
of sharp spears and swords.

45:43.991 --> 45:45.909
If you don't leave these guys alone,

45:45.993 --> 45:49.079
you will be cut into tiny pieces.

45:55.127 --> 45:56.587
Byun Kitae.

45:56.670 --> 45:57.671
You tell him.

45:58.213 --> 46:03.093
We should all stick to the territories
we agreed to stick to.

46:03.677 --> 46:07.222
If you run around with your Jesus talk
and try to do whatever you wantâ€¦

46:16.231 --> 46:19.943
This is what my God commands,
you low-class heathen.

46:37.878 --> 46:38.962
Chen Zhen?

46:40.923 --> 46:44.718
Today is the Sabbath.
I'll have you know it is God's den.

46:45.969 --> 46:49.223
Let's solve this peacefully
for everyone's sake.

46:49.848 --> 46:51.350
Particularly our brother's sake.

46:51.433 --> 46:53.143
Does that sound good to you?

46:53.894 --> 46:54.895
What do you say?

46:59.566 --> 47:02.152
Your God has come to my restaurant
on the Sabbath

47:02.236 --> 47:03.529
to argue about a bunch of fish?

47:04.363 --> 47:05.531
That's ridiculous.

47:05.614 --> 47:08.116
See, my idols never take a day off.

47:09.660 --> 47:11.036
Fucking hell!

47:15.457 --> 47:18.001
I'm gonna let you save face today, Pastor.

47:18.585 --> 47:20.170
If your God needs fish that bad,

47:21.255 --> 47:22.923
then I'll let 'em have it.

47:27.845 --> 47:30.097
God's will be done, sir.

47:30.180 --> 47:31.598
We got what we wanted.

47:32.641 --> 47:33.642
For now.

47:35.435 --> 47:36.645
The skate is all yours.

47:47.322 --> 47:49.700
Since you came all the way to my turf,

47:50.200 --> 47:52.244
I'll treat you to our finest wine.

47:54.037 --> 47:55.205
Drink in good health.

48:08.427 --> 48:10.012
Get the hot pots out.

48:21.481 --> 48:23.400
The pastor's well-connected.

48:23.483 --> 48:25.068
Last Christmas, he donated tons of money

48:25.152 --> 48:27.738
to build farms and factories around here.
No joke.

48:27.821 --> 48:30.532
He's friends with all the politicians
and leaders in the country.

48:30.616 --> 48:33.493
He knows everything
that goes on here in Suriname.

48:33.577 --> 48:35.370
I heard his nickname's "The Governor."

48:35.454 --> 48:37.581
I also heard other Koreans saying that

48:37.664 --> 48:39.458
he could be the next president
if he wanted.

48:42.127 --> 48:43.629
-What kind of bullshit is that?
-What?

48:43.712 --> 48:45.714
Running a country isn't a joke.

48:45.797 --> 48:49.343
Would you ever consider electing someone
from China or Mexico to be our president?

48:49.426 --> 48:50.344
Huh?

48:50.427 --> 48:52.346
Suriname is one giant melting pot.

48:52.429 --> 48:55.265
The prime minister a few years back
actually was Chinese.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.184
-Are you serious?
-Mm-hmm.

48:57.267 --> 48:58.268
You know this for a fact?

48:58.352 --> 49:01.355
Why would I make shit up
while we're enjoying our beer and profits?

49:01.438 --> 49:03.941
Everyone in Koreatown said the same thing.

49:12.616 --> 49:14.076
Okay.

49:14.159 --> 49:16.620
So that means the pastor
is a big fish in Suriname.

49:16.703 --> 49:18.497
-We have to stay on the man's good side.
-Mmm.

49:18.580 --> 49:20.582
You know the last batch of skate we got?

49:20.666 --> 49:23.710
We take the nicest ones from the whole lot
and deliver it right to his door.

49:23.794 --> 49:26.546
And the ginseng liquor you got
from your wife last week.

49:26.630 --> 49:28.298
We send that over with the skate.

49:30.509 --> 49:32.803
Not the liquor.
I'll need that to boost my energy.

49:32.886 --> 49:35.305
My wife wants to try
for a second kid soon.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.641
You can't afford the one you've got.

49:37.724 --> 49:41.478
Diapers, baby food, the school tuition.
How will you pay for that? Huh?

49:41.561 --> 49:43.772
The pastor can guarantee
our success here, Eungsoo.

49:43.855 --> 49:44.898
We need the liquor.

49:46.358 --> 49:48.944
Wow, you shit.

49:49.903 --> 49:52.114
I'm trying to cement things
and you bulk.

49:52.197 --> 49:54.700
Hey, I didn't say for sure
I wouldn't do it.

49:54.783 --> 49:56.743
You didn't say for sure you would either.

49:56.827 --> 50:00.706
Just enjoy your precious ginseng liquor
and pop out as many kids as you want.

50:00.789 --> 50:03.458
Go on,
but you're gonna kill the business, man.

50:03.542 --> 50:04.876
Get your panties out of your ass.

50:04.960 --> 50:07.212
I was just telling you
why my wife sent it.

50:07.295 --> 50:11.216
And I always heard that church workers
aren't allowed to drink alcohol.

50:11.299 --> 50:13.093
You don't remember him
enjoying the rice wine?

50:13.176 --> 50:15.095
It's monks who aren't allowed
to enjoy anything.

50:15.178 --> 50:17.639
Pastors are good to go.
Get your stuff straight.

50:21.768 --> 50:24.104
What's it gonna take
for you to do it? Come on!

50:25.439 --> 50:28.734
Hey, ginseng liquor is soul food
for most Koreans.

50:28.817 --> 50:31.528
Everyone knows it's a good gift.
Hand it over.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.990
I'll give it to him 'cause you're my pal.

50:36.116 --> 50:38.160
-The math?
-Fifty-six.

50:38.785 --> 50:41.872
Holy shit. You actually know it.
Good! You've been studying.

50:41.955 --> 50:43.623
I always knew it.

50:43.707 --> 50:45.333
Eight times seven then?

50:45.417 --> 50:46.626
Sixty-four.

50:46.710 --> 50:50.380
Dumbass.

51:36.301 --> 51:37.427
-Hello?
-<i>Kang?</i>

51:37.511 --> 51:38.678
<i>Is that you, Kang?</i>

51:38.762 --> 51:40.555
<i>Captain Kim from the Dolphin!</i>

51:40.639 --> 51:42.933
Yes, how are you?
Are you in Korea already?

51:43.016 --> 51:44.810
<i>Korea my ass!</i>

51:44.893 --> 51:47.437
<i>I had to swing by Aruba</i>
<i>to pick up another container.</i>

51:47.521 --> 51:49.314
<i>My ship got hit with an inspection.</i>

51:49.397 --> 51:52.234
<i>They found cocaine</i>
<i>in your merchandise, Kang!</i>

51:53.693 --> 51:55.821
Did you say cocaine? With the skate?

51:55.904 --> 51:57.989
<i>Yeah, five days ago. I just got released.</i>

51:58.073 --> 51:59.616
<i>You put that shit on my ship, asshole?</i>

51:59.699 --> 52:01.785
No, Captain. I don't smuggle drugs.

52:01.868 --> 52:03.411
I would never do that.

52:03.495 --> 52:04.704
When did this happen?

52:04.788 --> 52:07.999
I'm trying to understand
how cocaine got in with our fish.

52:09.459 --> 52:11.086
If you can start from the beginning, I'm--

52:11.169 --> 52:12.671
<i>No, no, no. You've done enough.</i>

52:12.754 --> 52:15.340
<i>I'm only calling to let you know</i>
<i>your shipment stayed in Aruba.</i>

52:15.423 --> 52:16.675
<i>You're on your own!</i>

52:16.758 --> 52:18.093
Hello? Captain?

52:20.554 --> 52:22.222
Didâ€¦ did I hear you right?

52:22.305 --> 52:23.807
They found cocaine in our skate?

52:28.061 --> 52:29.312
Yeah, and it's in Aruba.

52:29.896 --> 52:32.858
Aruba is under Dutch jurisdiction.
Am I right?

52:35.152 --> 52:37.654
No way! How did cocaine
get mixed up with our fish?

52:43.451 --> 52:44.286
Let's find out.

52:45.412 --> 52:46.788
Where are you going?

52:48.081 --> 52:51.543
Eungsoo, we gotta move.
You go down to the office right away.

52:51.626 --> 52:54.045
-Someone has to know something about this.
-Now?

52:54.129 --> 52:55.589
Of course now. We have to get ahead.

52:55.672 --> 52:57.132
-Okay.
-Get down there.

52:59.801 --> 53:01.136
You're not coming along?

53:01.219 --> 53:03.096
I think big trouble's coming our way.

53:03.180 --> 53:05.557
I'll get a hold of the pastor
and see if he can sort this out.

53:05.640 --> 53:06.683
Right. Good idea.

53:06.766 --> 53:09.769
Speaking of the pastor, did you send
the skate and liquor like I asked?

53:12.522 --> 53:14.691
Oh, sort of. I sent really fresh skate.

53:14.774 --> 53:16.818
The ginseng liquor
could use a little more aging,

53:16.902 --> 53:17.861
so I didn't send it yet.

53:17.944 --> 53:20.739
Stupid idiot.
I already promised we'd send it over.

53:20.822 --> 53:23.283
All right, I got it. I'll send it. Relax.

53:23.366 --> 53:25.160
Now quit yelling
and let me get out of here.

53:25.243 --> 53:26.244
Let's stay in touch.

53:26.328 --> 53:28.079
I'll call you. Huh? Bye.

53:37.005 --> 53:38.006
PASTOR JEON YOHAN

53:45.013 --> 53:46.640
<i>Good evening, Brother Kang.</i>

53:46.723 --> 53:48.516
Sorry to call so late, pastor.
It's important.

53:48.600 --> 53:51.811
<i>It's never too late for God.</i>
<i>Is something wrong, brother?</i>

53:51.895 --> 53:53.688
Things have taken a bad turn.

53:53.772 --> 53:55.565
I didn't really know who else to call.

53:55.649 --> 53:58.068
Eungsoo and I have run into more trouble.

54:05.575 --> 54:08.495
Goodness.
How did all this happen?

54:11.748 --> 54:13.291
You're right to call, brother.

54:13.959 --> 54:15.752
Don't go anywhere for now.

54:15.835 --> 54:17.462
I'll try to make a few phone calls.

54:17.545 --> 54:20.590
I appreciate your help, Pastor.
I was panicking for a minute.

54:20.674 --> 54:23.009
Oh, and I haven't forgotten
the liquor I promised.

54:23.093 --> 54:25.220
<i>You'll get it. Soon.</i>

54:25.303 --> 54:26.263
All right.

54:49.327 --> 54:51.913
<i>The person you want</i>
<i>to reach is outside of our service area.</i>

54:51.997 --> 54:53.748
<i>Please leave a voice message.</i>

54:57.377 --> 54:59.379
Hey, Eungsoo. What'd you find out?

54:59.462 --> 55:01.715
And why the hell aren't you answering?

55:37.500 --> 55:38.376
May I help you?

55:39.002 --> 55:41.338
Are you Mr. Kang Ingu from South Korea?

55:42.964 --> 55:44.758
No, I'm Chinese.

55:44.841 --> 55:47.135
Mr. Kang just went downtown.
He's not here.

55:54.184 --> 55:55.268
Take your hat off.

56:07.238 --> 56:09.366
KANG INGU

56:12.744 --> 56:13.870
Go, go!

56:14.913 --> 56:16.039
Stop right there!

56:17.707 --> 56:18.583
Stop!

56:19.584 --> 56:21.211
Freeze!

56:29.469 --> 56:30.303
Stop!

56:47.612 --> 56:48.863
Freeze! Freeze!

56:53.118 --> 56:54.869
Freeze!

57:03.962 --> 57:05.797
Stop! Hands up!

57:07.757 --> 57:09.008
Turn around!
