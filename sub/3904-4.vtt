WEBVTT

00:09.593 --> 00:13.016
... and not only do we hear
and appreciate your input

00:13.049 --> 00:16.927
but we are fully committed
to giving 110% in our efforts

00:16.978 --> 00:20.706
to fight this war against drugs
and take back your streets.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.320
But we can't do it alone.

00:22.486 --> 00:24.151
So when you see illegal activity

00:24.184 --> 00:27.013
we need you to pick up the phone
and call it in so that...

00:27.029 --> 00:28.144
Man, that's bullshit.

00:28.178 --> 00:30.085
Please hold all your questions...

00:30.102 --> 00:33.247
I near wore out my phone
dialin' 6-8-5-drug

00:33.330 --> 00:34.362
and for what ?

00:34.395 --> 00:37.191
Those boys were back on the
corner the next damn day.

00:37.258 --> 00:40.892
The fact remains the police
department can't do it alone.

00:41.058 --> 00:42.457
We need your cooperation.

00:42.707 --> 00:44.770
My cousin Willy Gant cooperated.

00:44.803 --> 00:46.801
He went downtown and testified.

00:47.083 --> 00:48.631
He deader than Tupac today.

00:48.928 --> 00:52.157
Look, I know the problem
seems insurmountable.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.787
But we are making progress.

00:54.270 --> 00:56.966
Take a look at this chart.
This line here represents...

00:59.080 --> 01:00.445
I have the microphone, ma'am.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.744
Let the woman speak.

01:02.025 --> 01:05.652
My kids, they can't
play outside no more.

01:05.853 --> 01:08.032
Some nights,
when we hear these pops

01:08.283 --> 01:11.311
we got to sleep under our beds.

01:11.794 --> 01:13.624
I come home from work

01:13.991 --> 01:16.536
I can't even get up my front steps

01:16.587 --> 01:19.132
'cause they occupied
by the drug dealers.

01:20.096 --> 01:22.859
Is that in that picture
you got up there ?

01:28.290 --> 01:29.356
I'm Major Colvin.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.498
I apologize for giving you
the wrong impression tonight.

01:33.731 --> 01:35.130
We mean no disr'espect.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.627
I know what's going on
in your neighborhoods.

01:37.693 --> 01:38.741
I see it every day.

01:39.108 --> 01:42.391
Ma'am, it pains me that you
cannot enter your own front door

01:42.491 --> 01:43.689
in safety

01:43.972 --> 01:45.420
and with dignity.

01:45.919 --> 01:50.179
The truth is, I can't promise
you it's gonna get any better.

01:50.462 --> 01:53.009
We can't lock up the thousands
out there on the corners.

01:53.058 --> 01:55.338
There'd be no place
to put them even if we could.

01:55.405 --> 01:59.765
We show you charts and statistics
like they mean something.

02:00.863 --> 02:03.555
But you going back
to your homes tonight

02:04.156 --> 02:06.320
we gonna be in our patrol cars

02:06.902 --> 02:09.898
and them boys still gonna
be out there on the corners

02:09.964 --> 02:11.196
deep in the game.

02:13.573 --> 02:15.536
This is the world we've got, people

02:16.302 --> 02:20.080
and it's about time
all of us had the good sense

02:20.695 --> 02:22.275
to at least admit that much.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.704
So, what's the answer ?

02:27.699 --> 02:28.913
I'm not sure.

02:30.795 --> 02:32.177
But whatever it is

02:33.280 --> 02:34.712
it can't be a lie.

02:37.956 --> 02:39.582
It's all yours, Sergeant.

02:42.001 --> 02:43.631
As I was pointing out...

02:43.686 --> 02:46.814
Who gave him a can of gasoline
and told him to put out the fire ?

02:47.147 --> 02:48.595
<i>...Are making progress.</i>

02:48.610 --> 02:49.693
Tommy Carcetti.

02:51.141 --> 02:52.005
Marla Daniels.

02:52.339 --> 02:52.921
I'm gonna...

02:52.954 --> 02:55.035
gonna take a run
at Eunetta Perkins.

02:55.066 --> 02:56.214
I know who you are.

02:56.248 --> 02:59.360
I've seen you with Delegate
Watkins a couple times already.

03:00.373 --> 03:02.757
Well, Councilman, this is
not your home district.

03:02.789 --> 03:04.603
What brings you
to the Westside ?

03:04.637 --> 03:07.066
I got the public safety
subcommittee, so...

03:07.732 --> 03:08.580
here I am.

03:09.313 --> 03:10.777
Anyway, good luck with Eunetta.

03:10.844 --> 03:14.171
And welcome, Ms. Daniels,
to the noble calling of public service.

03:14.221 --> 03:16.417
<i>...further west
in your neighborhoods.</i>

03:16.450 --> 03:20.395
<i>The numbers of crimes against
merchants are way, way down.</i>

03:21.236 --> 03:23.965
<i>We believe we're
making significant...</i>

03:24.448 --> 03:25.496
What the hell was that ?

03:25.513 --> 03:27.110
Tired of the bullshit.

03:27.409 --> 03:28.842
Tired make you lose your mind ?

03:30.000 --> 03:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:00.700 --> 05:02.076
Amsterdam

05:24.214 --> 05:26.547
So what you need from Bubs,
I mean exactly ?

05:26.724 --> 05:27.733
Lay of the land.

05:28.072 --> 05:30.383
Who has what corners,
now that the towers are down.

05:30.418 --> 05:33.353
We wanna know what happened to
the Barksdale people especially.

05:33.410 --> 05:34.725
And this pay how much ?

05:34.842 --> 05:36.367
Let's treat it like a real job ?

05:36.495 --> 05:39.405
Say five an hour, 30 on a day max.

05:39.850 --> 05:41.457
That's less than minimum wage.

05:41.539 --> 05:43.096
That's no withholding, Bubs.

05:43.318 --> 05:44.152
It's tax-free.

05:44.856 --> 05:47.072
Alright. It feels good to be
out here, you know ?

05:47.096 --> 05:48.210
Gainfully employed.

05:48.785 --> 05:50.978
- Thought your boy was coming, too.
- Johnny ?

05:52.711 --> 05:54.928
He don't think much of
this here with y'all.

05:55.034 --> 05:58.083
'Sides, he happen to be one
of the laziest white boys

05:58.106 --> 05:59.830
to ever shit between two shoes.

06:00.886 --> 06:02.916
- Me, I been workin' since I was a kid.
- Yeah ?

06:02.962 --> 06:04.796
What's your resume
read like, Bubs ?

06:04.983 --> 06:05.816
Just curious.

06:06.402 --> 06:08.759
Well, I ain't claimin'
no payroll jobs, Kima.

06:09.018 --> 06:11.141
It's been a while since
I punched a clock.

06:11.305 --> 06:12.431
When was that ?

06:13.064 --> 06:14.655
Long time ago

06:15.334 --> 06:16.871
before I had a sheet.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.256
Shoot, I was...

06:18.608 --> 06:19.933
I was still clean.

06:20.660 --> 06:22.302
I got one of those
stock boy jobs

06:22.373 --> 06:24.929
for one of those
"cheapest guy in town" stores.

06:25.363 --> 06:27.111
Unloading appliances

06:28.237 --> 06:32.842
taking air conditioners and shit
out to the customers' cars like that.

06:33.618 --> 06:34.895
How many you want ?

06:36.221 --> 06:37.359
What happened ?

06:37.875 --> 06:40.022
I put a clock radio
in the trash can one day

06:40.047 --> 06:41.794
tryin' to be cute,
and got caught.

06:42.673 --> 06:44.280
I ain't even need a clock radio.

06:44.562 --> 06:45.465
See, that's me.

06:46.227 --> 06:47.459
Born fuck up.

06:50.074 --> 06:51.328
A-ight, you know what ?

06:52.057 --> 06:53.745
Five dollars an' hour.

06:54.285 --> 06:56.654
30 on the day. That'll work.

07:34.116 --> 07:37.786
And this here is your
get-out-of-jail-free-card.

07:38.198 --> 07:41.306
On this card is my
full name and phone number.

07:43.471 --> 07:45.606
A police officer was
shot in this neighborhood

07:45.630 --> 07:46.732
a couple of weeks ago.

07:48.186 --> 07:51.130
Y'all know the incident
I'm speaking of, right ?

07:52.503 --> 07:54.454
I'm lookin' for the officer's gun

07:55.837 --> 07:56.835
a glock nine

07:59.451 --> 08:02.664
which happened to misplace
itself during this incident.

08:04.516 --> 08:06.439
Now, I don't care...

08:12.778 --> 08:14.442
I don't care who has it now

08:18.044 --> 08:20.237
I just need it
to find its way home.

08:26.095 --> 08:29.497
Y'all don't happen to know a fella
by the name of Peanut, right ?

08:31.303 --> 08:32.366
I didn't think so.

08:32.402 --> 08:35.462
Anyway, gentleman,
you know, one hand washes the other.

08:35.522 --> 08:37.316
You give me a good word
on that gun

08:37.351 --> 08:39.615
and I can make almost
any charge disappear...

08:41.594 --> 08:42.578
Any questions ?

08:45.043 --> 08:45.722
Get 'em out.

08:50.250 --> 08:51.844
Shit, I had to try somethin'.

09:08.794 --> 09:10.625
<i>One each. Keep it movin'.</i>

09:10.649 --> 09:13.276
<i>Little boys,  yellow tops all day long.
Right here.</i>

09:13.572 --> 09:14.897
Alright, alright.

09:15.085 --> 09:17.408
You see him to get that
knock out shit, a-ight.

09:18.439 --> 09:19.167
Good luck to ya.

09:20.386 --> 09:21.818
Yo, he down across Freemont ?

09:22.521 --> 09:23.975
Yeah, that way on this side.

09:23.999 --> 09:25.722
Oh and Barksdale is down the way.

09:25.757 --> 09:27.577
<i>Got the red tops, red tops !</i>

09:54.847 --> 09:55.937
<i>Spider bags.</i>

09:58.772 --> 10:00.919
<i>Come get the red tops,
red tops !</i>

10:01.728 --> 10:02.854
<i>Major Crimes Unit.</i>

10:03.534 --> 10:04.918
<i>He's not in right now.</i>

10:06.478 --> 10:07.017
<i>Alright.</i>

10:07.041 --> 10:08.671
To what do we owe the honor ?

10:09.112 --> 10:10.191
Just checking in.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.405
Why, you got somethin' goin' on ?

10:14.166 --> 10:15.505
Nothing too sexy.

10:15.527 --> 10:19.011
Just pushing a case up a hill,
inch by inch on Kintel Williamson...

10:19.245 --> 10:20.690
our stated target.

10:21.206 --> 10:22.754
We're workin' too, Lester.

10:22.812 --> 10:24.032
Yeah, on your own thing.

10:26.473 --> 10:28.595
You even listening to me, McNulty ?

10:28.642 --> 10:29.964
I got a real case to bring in.

10:29.999 --> 10:32.404
Fella name of Stringer Bell.
You mighta heard of him.

10:32.414 --> 10:34.069
You got a mouth on you, boy.

10:34.714 --> 10:36.274
He's still out there, Lester.

10:36.579 --> 10:38.174
He's got his corners, his money...

10:38.233 --> 10:39.696
fuck it, by now, for all you know

10:39.719 --> 10:41.419
he's got all that
downtown real estate.

10:41.454 --> 10:43.355
Motherfucker probably
owns half of Baltimore

10:43.378 --> 10:44.504
without us even knowing it.

10:44.528 --> 10:45.584
That ain't the point...

10:45.607 --> 10:48.410
Do you even know what happened
to all that real estate, Lester ?

10:48.422 --> 10:51.249
All that downtown property
Bell had title on ?

10:51.649 --> 10:52.410
Fuck no.

10:54.134 --> 10:56.105
He's probably laughing
his balls off right now

10:56.140 --> 10:57.513
at you, me, Daniels, all of us.

10:57.536 --> 11:00.644
You even pretending to speak
for anyone other than yourself, McNulty ?

11:00.667 --> 11:01.780
I'm speaking for the job.

11:01.793 --> 11:03.645
You wanna talk about police work ?

11:03.697 --> 11:06.126
I was doing the job when
you were just dreamin' on it.

11:06.161 --> 11:07.427
Daniels was out there, too.

11:07.463 --> 11:10.942
Now, you gonna fuck him when he
pulled you off a got-damn boat ?

11:10.967 --> 11:12.527
He's a boss, fuck the bosses.

11:12.573 --> 11:14.602
Maybe Daniels plays
a few games to get by

11:14.638 --> 11:17.476
but he's cost himself plenty
for the sake of the job !

11:17.969 --> 11:19.413
He's earned some loyalty.

11:19.449 --> 11:21.573
Fuck loyalty and fuck you, Lester.

11:21.607 --> 11:22.698
I never thought I'd hear

11:22.721 --> 11:24.927
chain-of-command horseshit
come outta your mouth.

11:24.950 --> 11:27.788
Motherfucker, I've spent a lot
of time in a lot of weak units.

11:27.800 --> 11:28.983
More than you.

11:29.076 --> 11:31.422
Now, this here ?
May not be perfect

11:31.469 --> 11:34.136
- but it's a chance to be police.
- Well, then be one.

11:40.707 --> 11:43.311
You're not even worth the skin
off my knuckles, junior.

11:43.863 --> 11:44.895
Jimmy, don't...

11:46.056 --> 11:48.245
You put fire to everything
you touch, McNulty

11:48.280 --> 11:49.956
then you walk away while it burns.

11:51.082 --> 11:52.690
I got nothin' more to say to you.

11:53.382 --> 11:54.250
Nothin'.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.156
And you.

11:58.589 --> 12:00.348
I'm surprised at you, girl.

12:01.615 --> 12:03.667
Daniels raised you from a pup.

12:09.391 --> 12:11.151
Gotta get with Bubs.

12:23.196 --> 12:24.838
Check on those fucking properties.

12:29.518 --> 12:32.298
Well, Major Colvin,
what do you think ?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.755
It all sounds good.

12:36.518 --> 12:39.591
But before I give you a final answer,
I need to speak with my wife.

12:39.685 --> 12:41.738
I'm not talking about the position.

12:42.770 --> 12:44.153
Your cheesecake.

12:46.111 --> 12:47.448
The cheesecake's fine.

12:47.612 --> 12:50.099
They bring it in from Michael's,
out on York Road.

12:50.627 --> 12:52.938
It's got a little
cinnamon in the crust.

12:53.125 --> 12:54.004
None better.

12:54.650 --> 12:58.434
Course, I like to think our
offer's pretty damn good, too.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.657
Excuse me while I go to the
little boy's room, gentlemen.

13:02.692 --> 13:03.853
I need to tinkle.

13:08.813 --> 13:09.588
Tinkle ?

13:10.396 --> 13:13.141
I never understood why
a grown-ass man gotta talk like that.

13:13.411 --> 13:16.331
He need to take a piss,
whether he know it or not.

13:16.765 --> 13:19.051
You'll get used to these
academic types, Bunny.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.209
'Specially when you get
that first paycheck.

13:21.502 --> 13:23.754
I mean, 80k is
nothin' to sneeze at

13:23.766 --> 13:25.326
for a number two security job.

13:25.573 --> 13:27.731
Full bennies
on top of your pension.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.353
Yeah, it is generous.

13:29.740 --> 13:30.350
And dull...

13:31.230 --> 13:32.074
in a good way.

13:32.145 --> 13:32.684
I mean...

13:33.928 --> 13:35.698
the worst you'll
ever see is a rape.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.200
A date rape, maybe.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.292
You're ready to take it
down a notch, aren't you ?

13:40.327 --> 13:41.054
Hell yes.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.461
Yeah, that's how I felt.

13:43.576 --> 13:46.098
My only regret was that
I didn't tell the deputy ops

13:46.108 --> 13:48.983
to stick it in his ass
on my way out the fucking door.

13:50.806 --> 13:52.601
Johns Hopkins wants you, Bunny.

13:52.742 --> 13:54.630
And they wanna pay
Johns Hopkins money.

13:54.877 --> 13:55.591
But what ?

13:56.343 --> 13:57.621
You gotta ask your wife ?

13:57.645 --> 13:59.380
Oh man, I ain't gotta
ask her nothin'.

13:59.392 --> 14:00.201
I'm just...

14:00.544 --> 14:02.808
letting Mr. Jenkins
stew a little, is all.

14:04.861 --> 14:06.022
Wonder what's keeping him.

14:06.925 --> 14:08.355
All he had to do was tinkle.

14:08.402 --> 14:10.748
I guess he felt the need
to make a dookie, too.

14:50.882 --> 14:55.439
They got corners up on Argyle
and along Freemont up top.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.446
Avenue corners belong to everybody.

15:01.032 --> 15:04.047
Some who was with Barksdale,
some independent-like.

15:04.164 --> 15:07.234
McHenry Street got some
of Barksdale's people too

15:07.726 --> 15:10.705
but gangster Webster's crews
is right beside 'em.

15:10.835 --> 15:13.473
What about the Lower Avenue
corners and the Poe Homes ?

15:13.520 --> 15:15.640
They belong to a young
boy name Marlo.

15:16.050 --> 15:17.188
Go by the name a Black.

15:17.363 --> 15:18.138
Marlo ?

15:18.795 --> 15:19.581
Young boy.

15:19.979 --> 15:22.385
Got all that good real
estate near downtown ?

15:22.513 --> 15:24.906
Got hisself the lunchtime trade.

15:25.234 --> 15:27.464
If Bell and Barksdale
were gonna hold anything

15:27.500 --> 15:29.671
they'd hold onto the Homes
and Avenue corners.

15:29.706 --> 15:31.464
Is Marlo one of
Barksdale's people ?

15:33.283 --> 15:34.441
Marlo what ?

15:36.588 --> 15:38.617
C'mon, you got anything
else on this guy ?

15:38.629 --> 15:40.036
You got another tip, maybe ?

15:41.327 --> 15:43.004
So much for the hourly wage.

15:44.494 --> 15:46.981
1-0-7-m-7-0-3.

15:47.110 --> 15:47.884
Yeah.

15:50.827 --> 15:52.727
That's the tag on the truck he ride.

15:53.126 --> 15:55.919
1-0-7-m-7-0-3.

16:01.954 --> 16:03.315
Did you prime it ?

16:04.838 --> 16:07.910
That little rubber ball right
there, next to the spark plug.

16:08.156 --> 16:10.972
You gotta push it in three times
before you try to start it.

16:11.148 --> 16:12.884
Gets the gas goin' to the carb.

16:13.833 --> 16:17.181
You want the truth, I ain't
never used one of these.

16:17.252 --> 16:18.565
Never had no call to.

16:18.635 --> 16:21.779
Yeah, well, I didn't pick you up
for your landscaping skills.

16:22.271 --> 16:23.562
All these Spanish ?

16:23.936 --> 16:24.968
They on paper, too.

16:25.648 --> 16:27.302
I only use people like y'all.

16:27.759 --> 16:31.265
Sometimes it comes back on me,
sometimes it works out fine.

16:32.686 --> 16:34.246
How long you been uptown ?

16:34.585 --> 16:35.535
10 years.

16:37.340 --> 16:39.204
Hotter than a motherfucker out here.

16:39.826 --> 16:40.740
Yeah, it's hot.

16:41.421 --> 16:42.371
Every day.

16:43.156 --> 16:45.502
You gonna be ridin'
in the back of that hard truck

16:45.527 --> 16:46.523
bouncin' around

16:46.828 --> 16:47.961
every day.

16:48.513 --> 16:51.680
And your back's gonna
be yellin' at you, every day.

16:53.544 --> 16:54.682
I used to drive an SL.

16:54.799 --> 16:57.180
Pretty gold convertible, nice rims.

16:58.052 --> 16:59.918
I don't even think
on that car no more.

17:01.009 --> 17:02.615
You put it behind you, huh ?

17:02.956 --> 17:04.022
Some can't.

17:05.289 --> 17:08.152
I'm just sayin':
You wanna stay on the straight

17:08.457 --> 17:10.362
ain't gonna be no big reward to it.

17:10.527 --> 17:12.108
This is it right here.

17:13.517 --> 17:15.933
Prime that bitch three times.
She'll start right up.

17:32.016 --> 17:32.730
Miss Pearlman.

17:33.164 --> 17:34.044
Cedric.

17:37.117 --> 17:38.642
How goes Kintel Williamson ?

17:39.444 --> 17:41.501
- Anything there for me yet ?
- No, not yet.

17:43.308 --> 17:44.129
We'll get there.

17:45.242 --> 17:47.201
Is that all you
came by to tell me ?

17:47.741 --> 17:49.629
Just keeping the lines
of dialogue open.

17:50.580 --> 17:51.793
So, what's on your plate ?

17:52.022 --> 17:55.079
Oh, there's plenty of
surprises around here.

18:10.210 --> 18:11.184
Parole hearing ?

18:12.205 --> 18:12.955
This soon ?

18:13.014 --> 18:16.098
He fingered a dirty guard up
at Jessup, apparently.

18:16.180 --> 18:18.209
Got a big gold star
next to his name.

18:18.244 --> 18:19.675
That's some bullshit.

18:20.062 --> 18:20.919
Not to worry.

18:21.623 --> 18:24.050
They send me the hearing
notifications for a reason.

18:27.579 --> 18:31.391
"Mr. Barksdale ran a continuous,
violent criminal enterprise

18:31.790 --> 18:33.866
and was a major drug trafficker."

18:34.796 --> 18:38.407
"During the years 1999 to 2002

18:39.381 --> 18:42.665
he was strongly suspected
to have ordered or caused

18:42.677 --> 18:44.824
the deaths of over
a dozen individuals."

18:44.855 --> 18:48.128
Parole commission's not gonna
walk him on his first trip to the plate.

18:48.174 --> 18:49.828
Not after a letter like that.

18:49.898 --> 18:50.484
Good work.

18:51.036 --> 18:52.022
I have my moments.

18:53.482 --> 18:54.854
Nice suit, by the way.

18:56.648 --> 18:57.573
Thanks.

18:59.766 --> 19:01.432
I see you dress left.

19:08.944 --> 19:09.635
Everyday.

19:29.527 --> 19:31.909
<i>The number you've called
is no longer in service.</i>

19:31.929 --> 19:34.040
<i>If you feel you've reached
this recording in error</i>

19:34.051 --> 19:35.729
<i>please check
the number and dial...</i>

19:39.358 --> 19:40.443
<i>Nothing ?</i>

19:40.943 --> 19:42.807
That address up off Reisterstown.

19:42.830 --> 19:44.681
Same one he was
showing two years ago

19:44.719 --> 19:46.337
when I ran the car he was using.

19:46.361 --> 19:48.261
Stringer's a settled guy.

19:48.343 --> 19:49.269
Not there he ain't.

19:49.950 --> 19:51.823
Woman living there,
last time I checked.

19:51.834 --> 19:52.784
Just a front name.

19:52.819 --> 19:53.734
His girl maybe.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.699
Not unless he likes 'em over
50 and asshole ugly.

19:59.647 --> 20:01.136
I'm sure she's real nice though.

20:01.148 --> 20:03.729
Good school spirit...
always says "hi" to you in the halls.

20:03.740 --> 20:05.370
You think he met her in college ?

20:08.807 --> 20:10.309
What, what'd I say ?

20:14.916 --> 20:15.889
What you got ?

20:16.359 --> 20:18.939
Tag comes back to
an address over on Dukeland.

20:19.326 --> 20:20.887
Female, 53 years...

20:20.933 --> 20:22.142
See ? That's how they do...

20:22.476 --> 20:25.034
But I got a hit on a Marlo,
street name of Black.

20:25.479 --> 20:26.993
Marlo Stanfield.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.575
22 years

20:28.868 --> 20:29.948
BPI number

20:30.604 --> 20:31.836
and a pretty good sheet.

20:32.111 --> 20:33.737
What, you thought he'd be cherry ?

20:33.753 --> 20:36.909
Oh, I knew he had his cherry
busted, but not like this.

20:37.062 --> 20:37.965
Check it out.

20:44.177 --> 20:46.476
Think I'm gonna take
a ride downtown to homicide.

20:46.512 --> 20:47.086
Wanna come ?

20:47.298 --> 20:48.858
Nope, got someplace to be.

20:50.183 --> 20:51.368
This thing with Lester ?

20:52.282 --> 20:53.772
I feel like shit about it.

20:54.975 --> 20:56.488
Well, you get used to it...

21:02.774 --> 21:04.792
<i>We roll up
and get out of the car.</i>

21:04.834 --> 21:06.090
<i>Crowd parts like the red sea.</i>

21:06.113 --> 21:08.494
<i>Victim on the ground,
bleeding all over the place.</i>

21:08.506 --> 21:10.700
<i>Screaming "I'm going
to kill that fucking bitch."</i>

21:10.734 --> 21:12.435
<i>But nothing's really
wrong with him...</i>

21:33.406 --> 21:34.837
Ah, shit.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.066
You tried to sneak
by me, didn't ya ?

21:37.253 --> 21:39.499
I was just comin' in
quiet and respectful.

21:39.581 --> 21:42.033
Well, for a big man,
you do have a dancer's grace.

21:42.056 --> 21:43.968
But I, sir, I have
the eyes of an eagle.

21:44.508 --> 21:47.809
And the fact that you tried
to slither into your work space undetected

21:47.891 --> 21:51.574
does not bode well for the recovery
prospect of our missing firearm, does it ?

21:52.020 --> 21:52.595
I'll get it.

21:53.651 --> 21:54.659
What up, Mr. Bunk ?

21:55.199 --> 21:56.536
Hey, girlfriend.

21:56.817 --> 21:58.132
Vernon Holley working tonight ?

21:58.214 --> 22:00.089
Uh, yeah, he's four-to-twelve.

22:00.278 --> 22:01.849
You should try the coffee room.

22:02.682 --> 22:03.326
Alright.

22:07.421 --> 22:10.002
Man, I would murder that.

22:10.213 --> 22:11.257
If she wasn't...

22:12.230 --> 22:13.039
particular ?

22:13.074 --> 22:15.617
<i>Hey Busfield, that line
is blinkin' for you.</i>

22:15.712 --> 22:17.788
- Find that gun.
- Yeah, okay.

22:22.350 --> 22:23.921
Motherfuck you, too.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.002
Marlo Stanfield

22:28.203 --> 22:29.551
A.K.A. Black.

22:29.644 --> 22:31.709
Boy's the spawn of the devil, Kima.

22:31.750 --> 22:32.464
I see.

22:32.981 --> 22:34.795
Y'all damn near
had him on this murder.

22:35.211 --> 22:36.209
What happened ?

22:36.680 --> 22:37.612
We had a wit.

22:37.861 --> 22:40.857
Boy they called Pooh Bear,
chubby fella with braids.

22:41.340 --> 22:43.270
We stashed Pooh over
in east Baltimore.

22:43.469 --> 22:46.116
Even had him wear one of
those e-lectronic bracelets

22:46.149 --> 22:47.597
so we could find him quick.

22:47.963 --> 22:48.695
You lost him ?

22:48.795 --> 22:49.760
Not exactly.

22:50.193 --> 22:52.656
Pooh went back to the Westside
to cop some hydro.

22:52.822 --> 22:55.485
He could've bought the same
weed where he was, right ?

22:56.267 --> 22:58.854
We found him with two in his
chest and one in his mouth.

22:59.104 --> 23:01.599
The bracelet led us right
to the spot where he fell.

23:01.799 --> 23:02.832
Those things work.

23:04.562 --> 23:05.794
Marlo's serious.

23:06.060 --> 23:07.408
That motherfucker's real.

23:08.372 --> 23:11.068
I dunno, I think a volcano's
way better than a computer.

23:11.918 --> 23:13.648
You see computers every day.

23:13.731 --> 23:15.229
How often do you see a volcano ?

23:15.279 --> 23:16.992
Yeah, like I built the computer.

23:17.026 --> 23:18.673
Hey, you built the volcano.

23:18.707 --> 23:19.489
Big whoop.

23:21.497 --> 23:22.363
Can I keep it ?

23:22.895 --> 23:23.976
Yeah, if you want to.

23:30.582 --> 23:31.914
- Night, Mikey.
- Night.

23:32.213 --> 23:33.428
- Sleep tight.
- Okay.

23:36.857 --> 23:37.971
It's good that you came.

23:38.322 --> 23:39.269
He's very proud.

23:40.235 --> 23:41.067
Glad to.

23:43.817 --> 23:47.578
Jimmy, um, there's
a problem with the alimony.

23:47.811 --> 23:48.844
What's the problem ?

23:49.476 --> 23:51.805
You're behind by like four months.

23:52.258 --> 23:55.170
What can I tell you ?
I'm paying 2,000 a month in support.

23:55.188 --> 23:56.602
After that, there's nothing left.

23:56.651 --> 23:57.218
Right.

23:57.301 --> 23:59.630
But you signed a separation
agreement that gives me

23:59.648 --> 24:00.929
another 1,000 in alimony...

24:00.962 --> 24:04.356
Elena, I only signed that fucking thing
'cause I thought we'd be together.

24:04.522 --> 24:05.586
Look at how much I make

24:05.637 --> 24:08.449
I'm not even close to being able
to pay that much every month.

24:08.549 --> 24:11.029
My lawyer says that
we have to serve you.

24:11.757 --> 24:14.387
What, that suit of a boyfriend
won't cough up any cash ?

24:18.048 --> 24:20.062
Blood from a stone, darlin'.

24:27.640 --> 24:28.639
Beginning today

24:29.654 --> 24:31.768
you can sell drugs
in west Baltimore

24:32.484 --> 24:34.206
but only where we say you can.

24:35.969 --> 24:36.736
Push 'em.

24:37.351 --> 24:37.850
Hard.

24:38.199 --> 24:40.313
Get to it, people.
And don't get captured.

24:46.542 --> 24:47.474
Stay right there.

24:47.774 --> 24:49.122
Get him up against the wall.

24:49.653 --> 24:51.518
Hey, listen to what
I'm tellin' you.

25:03.078 --> 25:04.359
You know, kids.

25:04.776 --> 25:07.225
This is a simple fucking
thing we're saying here.

25:07.258 --> 25:10.104
If you stay on this corner,
you're going in a wagon.

25:10.354 --> 25:12.716
If you move yourself
down to the free zone

25:12.850 --> 25:14.913
down to the vacants
along Vincent Street

25:15.180 --> 25:17.246
then you can do
whatever the fuck you want.

25:17.396 --> 25:18.844
How much fairer can we be ?

25:18.894 --> 25:20.292
Yeah, I saw that, you little fuck.

25:20.391 --> 25:21.240
What's your name ?

25:22.621 --> 25:23.637
You got a name ?

25:23.986 --> 25:25.284
Peanut Butter and Jelly.

25:26.017 --> 25:26.682
Address ?

25:27.399 --> 25:28.613
What's your address ?

25:29.013 --> 25:30.362
I stay over on Dolphin Street.

25:30.677 --> 25:32.025
Your address, numbnuts.

25:32.608 --> 25:35.321
Are there any numbers on the
front of your fucking house ?

25:37.790 --> 25:38.705
Listen up.

25:40.052 --> 25:42.033
This corner is indicted.

25:42.382 --> 25:44.429
We're coming back
tomorrow and when we do

25:44.479 --> 25:45.794
everybody wears bracelets...

25:45.944 --> 25:48.873
unless you move your shit
down to Vincent Street

25:49.055 --> 25:50.758
down where the houses are all vacant.

25:50.875 --> 25:53.222
You do that, we don't give a shit.

25:53.338 --> 25:55.102
Vincent Street is like Switzerland.

25:55.634 --> 25:56.849
Or Amsterdam.

25:57.132 --> 25:58.263
The fuck is that ?

25:58.413 --> 26:00.464
It's one of those countries
where drugs are legal.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.226
Vincent Street is
your Amsterdam in Baltimore.

26:03.342 --> 26:05.039
You go down there,
we don't give a fuck.

26:05.123 --> 26:07.103
You stay here, you go to jail.

26:12.355 --> 26:14.070
I ain't goin' to no Hamsterdam.

26:15.384 --> 26:16.533
Killed a witness, huh ?

26:16.582 --> 26:18.463
The way that Vernon Holley
told it, yeah.

26:18.529 --> 26:19.594
So, Marlo's a hitter.

26:20.476 --> 26:21.825
Maybe he works for Stringer.

26:22.174 --> 26:23.123
Makes sense.

26:23.705 --> 26:25.518
If you need me,
I'm gonna be Westside.

26:25.785 --> 26:26.567
What about you ?

26:26.683 --> 26:28.697
I gotta get the scent
of my boy, Stringer.

26:29.131 --> 26:30.595
We been off him too long.

26:30.711 --> 26:31.793
What's your first move ?

26:31.893 --> 26:33.008
Something Prez said.

26:33.992 --> 26:34.873
P-and-p ?

26:35.855 --> 26:37.769
B-and-b, like the liquor.

26:37.852 --> 26:40.083
You mean, liqueur, Plauzinski...

26:40.116 --> 26:40.865
Prez-blew-skee.

26:40.914 --> 26:42.329
Benedictine and brandy.

26:42.478 --> 26:45.248
That was invented by
a bartender over at Club 21.

26:45.497 --> 26:47.312
All that good shit
comes outta New York.

26:47.378 --> 26:50.890
I need every deed transfer
involving that company, Harry.

26:51.006 --> 26:51.622
Today.

27:10.134 --> 27:11.631
Yo, I'm asking them corner boys

27:11.665 --> 27:13.944
if they know where
the Barksdale package be at ?

27:13.978 --> 27:16.091
They lookin' at me
like I ain't even talkin'.

27:17.470 --> 27:20.149
On this strip,
Marlo's the name ringin' out.

27:20.299 --> 27:21.099
There he is.

27:21.698 --> 27:22.314
Ya see him ?

27:34.165 --> 27:35.696
He didn't stay too long.

27:36.628 --> 27:37.743
Marlo's ghostin'.

27:39.126 --> 27:41.538
We're kinda sensitive about
giving out personal data

27:41.555 --> 27:42.853
on matriculating students.

27:42.903 --> 27:45.000
Well, I could come back
with a court order.

27:45.616 --> 27:47.230
Then'd have to give it to you.

27:49.103 --> 27:51.365
My man has serious
issues with women.

27:52.231 --> 27:54.877
Domestic violence,
really ugly stuff.

27:59.777 --> 28:01.642
I can't show you any paper.

28:02.990 --> 28:04.538
But let me get my screen up.

28:09.530 --> 28:10.679
What did we tell you ?

28:10.745 --> 28:12.321
What'd we fuckin' tell you, man ?

28:12.372 --> 28:15.501
We told you to get your selves
down to the free zone, didn't we ?

28:15.551 --> 28:17.447
We're tryin'
to give you guys a break.

28:18.146 --> 28:19.942
We're offerin' you, uh...

28:21.373 --> 28:22.222
amnesty.

28:22.472 --> 28:24.369
You take your crew
down to Vincent Street

28:24.436 --> 28:26.982
you do your dirt,
nobody's gonna bother you.

28:27.430 --> 28:28.345
Whad'ya say ?

28:29.942 --> 28:31.606
You guys fucking braindead ?

28:32.005 --> 28:32.937
Whad'ya say ?

28:36.100 --> 28:38.545
Yo, chief how you gonna come
up here and try to game us ?

28:38.579 --> 28:39.011
Say what ?

28:39.494 --> 28:41.658
I'm sayin' ya actin' like
we retarded or somethin'.

28:41.690 --> 28:43.221
Better we put a foot in your ass ?

28:43.239 --> 28:44.287
Least we'd understand it.

28:44.303 --> 28:45.584
This ain't a trick, shitbird.

28:45.619 --> 28:47.598
Look: we grind,
and y'all try to stop it.

28:47.632 --> 28:48.630
That's how we do.

28:49.246 --> 28:51.357
Why you gotta go
and fuck with the program ?

28:52.738 --> 28:53.771
All due respect.

28:59.695 --> 29:01.236
Nothing but tumbleweeds.

29:04.282 --> 29:05.380
Get me some buses.

29:06.645 --> 29:08.359
Tomorrow, we clean the corners

29:09.075 --> 29:11.570
put 'em all in one place
and give 'em the news.

29:13.389 --> 29:14.919
And I'm not asking anymore.

29:24.150 --> 29:26.999
From here to Freemont
you got Barksdale's people

29:27.000 --> 29:29.052
eastsiders and freelancers, too.

29:29.441 --> 29:30.644
On the same corners ?

29:30.850 --> 29:31.301
Yup.

29:32.573 --> 29:33.988
That shit don't make sense.

29:34.583 --> 29:36.367
Yo, can we call it a day, Kima ?

29:40.418 --> 29:41.526
Bullshit, man.

29:42.510 --> 29:43.310
You too ?

29:43.823 --> 29:45.587
What the fuck is up
with these phones ?

29:45.628 --> 29:47.659
I be seein' kids
throwin' them away all day.

29:47.967 --> 29:49.600
They got cash
like that to waste ?

29:49.990 --> 29:51.447
These shits be layin' all over.

29:51.488 --> 29:53.579
Sometimes you get lucky
find some minutes on 'em

29:53.620 --> 29:55.199
sell 'em for walkin' around money.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.066
They burners, Kima.

29:57.701 --> 29:58.236
Burners ?

30:02.095 --> 30:05.234
Marone, another murder.
In Waverly, no less.

30:05.335 --> 30:06.095
You believe it ?

30:06.894 --> 30:08.064
I would be fuckin' shocked

30:08.084 --> 30:10.484
if it was an african-american
perpetrated the crime.

30:10.723 --> 30:12.203
It ain't even funny, Ang.

30:13.159 --> 30:16.432
This is why everyone's leaving this city,
black and white.

30:17.447 --> 30:19.734
I was at a community meeting
Sunday in west Baltimore.

30:19.749 --> 30:22.080
People were spittin' mad.
And I can't say I blame them.

30:22.094 --> 30:24.141
Well, they could move
to a better neighborhood.

30:24.157 --> 30:26.054
That is, if they were
willing to work for it.

30:26.070 --> 30:28.773
Come on, I been hearin' all that
my-poor-immigrant-father-made-it

30:28.803 --> 30:30.806
-so-why-can't-the-blacks
bullshit my whole life.

30:30.821 --> 30:32.864
You think there's not good
people on the Westside

30:32.894 --> 30:34.432
who want the same things that you...

30:34.463 --> 30:35.329
Okay, Mrs. Roosevelt.

30:35.359 --> 30:37.241
All's I'm sayin' is,
it's not about color.

30:38.258 --> 30:39.872
So what's your next move, Tommy ?

30:40.619 --> 30:43.942
The Sun says an Anderson's state
senate seat is up for grabs.

30:44.046 --> 30:47.363
Fuck that, you could go after
Ruppersberger in the second.

30:47.393 --> 30:48.573
He's only got one term.

30:54.212 --> 30:55.572
I'm gonna run for mayor.

31:00.951 --> 31:01.594
Mayor Tommy.

31:08.356 --> 31:09.523
She in the right joint ?

31:28.016 --> 31:30.661
She lets me sit next to her,
I buy her a drink...

31:30.721 --> 31:31.841
We each give you 10.

31:32.499 --> 31:33.650
20 if you fuck her.

31:33.709 --> 31:37.017
Oh please, show just
a little more class, besides

31:37.067 --> 31:38.590
I already had my day in the sun.

31:39.503 --> 31:41.386
Bullshit, Tommy.
Once a gash-hound...

31:41.400 --> 31:43.283
The bet is the bet,
you said I lost a step.

31:43.298 --> 31:44.583
I'm gonna prove I never did.

31:46.676 --> 31:48.543
- You in, Pete ?
- I'll pass.

32:04.468 --> 32:05.709
The sonofabitch did it.

32:06.335 --> 32:07.051
He did you.

32:07.934 --> 32:09.368
That's Theresa d'Agostino.

32:09.772 --> 32:10.877
Mario Dee's kid ?

32:11.460 --> 32:12.760
Yeah, she grew up alright.

32:12.969 --> 32:15.196
She's down in D.C.
Now with the national party.

32:15.431 --> 32:16.478
A campaign fixer.

32:17.045 --> 32:17.838
No shit.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.198
Tommy's known her
ever since law school.

32:20.676 --> 32:22.051
Just hear me out, okay ?

32:23.008 --> 32:24.397
- One drink.
- Go ahead.

32:24.800 --> 32:25.741
You're paying for it.

32:25.787 --> 32:27.611
Actually, they are.

32:28.717 --> 32:29.718
You made a bet.

32:30.779 --> 32:32.767
Don't tell me we have
to kiss or something.

32:32.796 --> 32:33.633
Not gonna happen.

32:35.158 --> 32:38.517
This isn't about ankle straps
and a two-and-a-half star hotel, is it ?

32:38.605 --> 32:40.546
Because the Alumni dinner
ended an hour ago

32:40.577 --> 32:42.284
and I could be back
in D.C. right now...

32:42.289 --> 32:43.312
That's the old me, Terri.

32:43.326 --> 32:45.763
Everything I got now,
my wife, my kids...

32:47.427 --> 32:48.862
I would not risk losing them.

32:49.549 --> 32:50.341
No way.

32:50.625 --> 32:53.463
Seeing you with your old gang
made me think bad thoughts.

32:54.227 --> 32:56.153
Your friends cheapen you, Tommy.

32:56.183 --> 32:58.640
You're just pissed off
that they didn't recognize you

32:58.655 --> 32:59.551
when you walked in.

32:59.716 --> 33:00.746
And why would they ?

33:01.165 --> 33:03.631
I mean, you're a Washingtonian now.

33:04.497 --> 33:06.290
That's Pete Sinopoli
over there, isn't it ?

33:07.592 --> 33:09.130
I hear he's back to practicing law.

33:09.161 --> 33:09.519
Yeah.

33:09.549 --> 33:10.999
He just didn't have it, did he ?

33:11.790 --> 33:12.822
I have it, Terri.

33:14.838 --> 33:16.452
I'm gonna make a run for mayor.

33:17.820 --> 33:19.404
And you're gonna run my campaign.

33:21.526 --> 33:23.378
Gimme one good reason why not to.

33:23.423 --> 33:24.663
I could give you 10.

33:24.947 --> 33:27.443
But here's the good one:
You're the wrong color.

33:27.861 --> 33:29.026
You're not electable here.

33:29.390 --> 33:30.943
And I never play the longshot.

33:31.123 --> 33:32.243
You like to win.

33:32.409 --> 33:33.619
I don't like to lose.

33:33.992 --> 33:35.157
It's not the same thing.

33:35.217 --> 33:37.668
But where's the fun in it
if you know you're gonna win ?

33:37.698 --> 33:39.621
I mean, you handled that
democrat in east L.A.

33:39.651 --> 33:40.801
What was his name, Garcia...

33:40.832 --> 33:41.832
- Valdez.
- Valdez.

33:42.939 --> 33:43.834
How hard was that ?

33:48.079 --> 33:50.873
I need someone like you on my side.

33:53.264 --> 33:53.936
I need you.

33:56.520 --> 33:57.523
How big a win bonus ?

33:58.419 --> 34:00.522
Get a white mayor elected
in Baltimore, honey

34:01.731 --> 34:02.778
you name your price.

34:03.688 --> 34:04.720
One drink was the deal.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.396
Go home, sleep it off.

34:08.471 --> 34:10.743
You'll wake up and realize
you're making a mistake.

34:12.237 --> 34:13.342
I can do this.

34:14.268 --> 34:16.838
Question is, are you
gonna come with me ?

34:47.083 --> 34:47.831
B and B.

34:51.623 --> 34:52.135
<i>Hello ?</i>

35:06.769 --> 35:09.865
Yo, how we not going to throw
a few hot ones at the motherfuckers ?

35:10.135 --> 35:13.074
One ass-whuppin' an'
we back off like some bitches.

35:13.358 --> 35:15.521
Now we on this
off-brand strip right here.

35:15.550 --> 35:17.666
Not even enough trade
for poot and his crew.

35:17.694 --> 35:18.674
This is bullshit, man.

35:18.687 --> 35:21.202
Look, man, String gonna
fix it, you'll see.

35:21.543 --> 35:23.205
Which one a y'all is Slim Charles ?

35:23.915 --> 35:24.441
Who ask ?

35:24.881 --> 35:25.676
That be Cutty.

35:26.273 --> 35:28.417
Your boy gave me a number,
said to ring you up

35:28.446 --> 35:30.221
when I was ready
to put in some work.

35:30.466 --> 35:31.327
But no answer.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.423
Took your time
callin' back, right ?

35:33.940 --> 35:36.104
Numbers don't play
after a few days, man.

35:36.119 --> 35:38.200
- We change 'em up.
- Ain't you know nothin' ?

35:38.670 --> 35:40.234
Respect, dawg, respect.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.816
Y'all don't know
who ya'll talkin' to, man.

35:43.472 --> 35:45.041
You still ain't say your business.

35:45.073 --> 35:46.637
I'm tryin' to get put on.

35:46.731 --> 35:47.825
What you got in mind ?

35:47.873 --> 35:49.452
Whatever you got that pays.

35:49.829 --> 35:50.563
Yo, Poot.

35:51.159 --> 35:51.947
Come here, man.

35:54.881 --> 35:57.180
Hey, look, man, call Shamrock, man.

35:57.211 --> 35:59.622
And tell him that soldier
finally came into the camp.

36:00.561 --> 36:01.717
You a soldier, huh ?

36:01.874 --> 36:03.798
Chill, Bodie, man, chill, man.

36:04.551 --> 36:05.630
Bodie Broadus ?

36:06.818 --> 36:07.710
Yeah, that's right.

36:07.898 --> 36:11.027
Shit, I remember your little ass
when you was still in diapers.

36:11.325 --> 36:13.562
I used to spar with
your older brother, James.

36:14.140 --> 36:15.470
That boy had a killer left.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.350
Yeah, when he ain't drop it.

36:20.148 --> 36:21.337
He still out here ?

36:23.349 --> 36:24.131
James been dead.

36:30.608 --> 36:31.906
Fuck's up with that cheesebox ?

36:32.781 --> 36:34.883
You ain't never rid
no school bus before ?

36:35.776 --> 36:38.372
I'm sayin', what they doin'
with the niggas on that corner ?

36:38.404 --> 36:38.998
Look, dawg.

36:39.514 --> 36:41.985
First thing, we gonna need
to do is get you some chrome.

36:42.298 --> 36:43.081
C'mon, man.

36:44.873 --> 36:47.611
My phone... shit.

36:53.852 --> 36:56.386
Yo, T.J. You got one
with some minutes left ?

36:56.699 --> 36:59.217
...which is not to say that
you couldn't do some multi-use

36:59.233 --> 37:00.986
with the Howard Street
properties, too.

37:01.016 --> 37:02.629
Residential-commercial could work.

37:03.098 --> 37:03.958
On Howard Street ?

37:03.993 --> 37:05.541
The whole point
of the block grant

37:05.573 --> 37:07.856
is to bring the Westside back
and make it high-end.

37:07.889 --> 37:10.267
The hippodrome project
was just a start, see ?

37:10.501 --> 37:11.397
But residential ?

37:12.257 --> 37:14.308
With the stadium
and the theater back on line

37:14.542 --> 37:17.139
that whole area is like inner
harbor east 10 years ago.

37:17.170 --> 37:18.359
And the thing is

37:18.421 --> 37:20.830
you're on the ground floor
with what you're holding.

37:20.861 --> 37:22.200
Yes, you are String.

37:22.889 --> 37:25.298
So we're still talking more
return than just flipping

37:25.314 --> 37:27.301
the properties for
the condemnation money.

37:27.489 --> 37:28.083
Way more.

37:28.817 --> 37:29.476
Excuse me.

37:32.819 --> 37:33.242
Yo.

37:34.243 --> 37:34.666
Naw.

37:35.495 --> 37:36.261
Not right now.

37:37.216 --> 37:37.888
A half hour.

37:39.468 --> 37:40.985
No, Sir, go ahead and fill it up.

37:41.689 --> 37:43.144
You got the order number, right ?

37:50.118 --> 37:50.853
Move your ass.

37:50.869 --> 37:51.980
Man, this some bullshit.

38:13.607 --> 38:15.406
My moms is gonna
be worried, and shit.

38:15.437 --> 38:16.626
Y'all is kidnappin' niggas.

38:16.658 --> 38:17.471
I'm Major Colvin.

38:20.635 --> 38:22.935
My name is Major Colvin.

38:23.467 --> 38:24.279
<i>Major what ?</i>

38:24.296 --> 38:25.673
<i>Major these, motherfucker.</i>

38:25.688 --> 38:27.973
And we had to bring you down
here this afternoon

38:30.146 --> 38:32.810
because you've not been
complying with our directives.

38:32.934 --> 38:33.545
Say what ?

38:34.781 --> 38:36.955
You're haven't been doing
what we asked you to do.

38:39.333 --> 38:40.084
When I'm done.

38:40.756 --> 38:41.773
I gotta pee now.

38:44.595 --> 38:45.409
He ain't playin'.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.583
Smell like he already
pissed in his drawers.

38:49.836 --> 38:50.946
Alright, go ahead.

38:54.770 --> 38:56.820
Yo, I gotta go, too.

38:57.352 --> 38:58.932
Well, you're just
gonna have to wait.

38:58.947 --> 39:01.012
You just let him go,
how you gonna discriminate ?

39:01.044 --> 39:02.686
Yo, faggy, why you touch my butt ?

39:16.659 --> 39:18.099
That's enough.

39:21.258 --> 39:22.729
The fun is over.

39:25.342 --> 39:26.278
Tyrell.

39:26.982 --> 39:28.766
Why weren't you in school today ?

39:28.954 --> 39:31.254
My stomach hurt.
I couldn't make it out the baff-room.

39:31.301 --> 39:33.209
Stand up when I talk
to you, young man.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.275
I know your mother, Tyrell.

39:37.478 --> 39:39.919
She didn't raise any clowns.

39:40.028 --> 39:42.109
- Now did she ?
- No, ma'am.

39:48.393 --> 39:49.661
It's yours, Major.

39:59.265 --> 40:00.875
Now, ladies and gentlemen

40:01.908 --> 40:04.036
we brought you down here because...

40:04.880 --> 40:06.882
you're here to learn
about the new way...

40:08.671 --> 40:12.191
<i>the new way that we're going
to do things on the corners...</i>

40:25.283 --> 40:26.332
That's downtown.

40:32.454 --> 40:33.908
Well, that makes no sense.

40:34.597 --> 40:35.489
All four.

40:52.271 --> 40:54.462
Go ahead, rip me
a new asshole

40:54.618 --> 40:56.418
and ask me where
I been for two days.

40:56.449 --> 40:57.451
'Tell us, hotshot.

40:59.145 --> 41:02.132
College registrar gives up
Stringer's course schedule.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.166
I tail him to where
he's laying his head.

41:04.308 --> 41:06.873
Downtown high-rise.
Name's on the lease, too.

41:07.092 --> 41:08.187
No attempt to hide it.

41:08.907 --> 41:11.233
I get up early next morning,
follow him from his door

41:11.263 --> 41:13.813
to a lunch meeting
with the State Senator.

41:14.565 --> 41:17.271
Same one with the bag man
we bounced the last time around.

41:17.302 --> 41:19.780
Couple of white guys
at the table, too, but nobody I read.

41:19.785 --> 41:21.907
And all the while, Stringer's
using his cell phone.

41:21.917 --> 41:24.416
Making calls in front of these
suits like it ain't no thing.

41:24.421 --> 41:25.771
Shit, I even
rang it up myself.

41:25.782 --> 41:27.613
Got his number from
an admissions form.

41:27.816 --> 41:31.508
Number wouldn't be 732-8793 ?

41:33.213 --> 41:35.596
I had Prez pull the B-and-B
property assessments

41:35.627 --> 41:37.551
and land transfers
from circuit court.

41:38.475 --> 41:40.899
Some of the paperwork
asked for a contact number.

41:40.931 --> 41:44.614
So, I'm not surprised our boy's
using his cell phone so freely.

41:45.600 --> 41:49.339
Those right there are the incoming
and outgoing numbers on his phone.

41:50.151 --> 41:52.483
Damn near all of them
are downtown exchanges.

41:53.265 --> 41:58.939
Architectural firms, city licensing...
attorneys, zoning offices.

41:59.027 --> 42:01.842
Even campus exchanges
over at B.C.C.C.

42:03.031 --> 42:04.043
You sayin' he's right ?

42:04.075 --> 42:07.141
I'm saying the phone is right.

42:08.361 --> 42:11.959
Account information confirms
he's had that number listed...

42:12.444 --> 42:13.508
for quite awhile.

42:18.261 --> 42:18.856
Nice work.

42:21.155 --> 42:23.720
Maybe the cell phone is clean
because he's keeping it.

42:23.877 --> 42:26.426
If it was dirty,
it probably be a burner.

42:29.915 --> 42:30.853
Disposables.

42:33.198 --> 42:34.528
The latest in yo tech.

42:34.623 --> 42:37.739
They make a few calls with
a burner, throw it away.

42:38.208 --> 42:40.008
Go on to the next phone,
do the same.

42:40.148 --> 42:42.448
There's more of those things
laying around the streets

42:42.479 --> 42:44.091
of west Baltimore than empty vials.

42:44.138 --> 42:46.687
Well, how the fuck you supposed
to get a wire up on that ?

42:46.859 --> 42:49.528
Yeah, well, first it
was payphones and pagers.

42:49.560 --> 42:52.265
Then it was cell phones
and face-to-face meets.

42:52.282 --> 42:53.096
Now this.

42:53.955 --> 42:55.458
The motherfuckers do learn.

42:55.646 --> 42:57.976
Every time we come at them,
they learn and adjust.

42:59.525 --> 43:00.103
So...

43:02.325 --> 43:03.623
Stringer's out of reach.

43:03.687 --> 43:05.110
You know, a couple years ago

43:05.735 --> 43:08.098
when they were buying up
all that downtown real estate

43:08.129 --> 43:10.009
I thought they were
buying it to flip it

43:10.651 --> 43:13.130
and get the cash when
the federal payout money lands

43:13.162 --> 43:14.866
and the properties are condemned.

43:14.890 --> 43:16.830
Bell and Barksdale
haven't sold any of it.

43:16.893 --> 43:19.709
They're buying more, in fact,
and applying for building permits.

43:20.302 --> 43:23.009
Seems that Stringer Bell's
worse than a drug dealer.

43:23.165 --> 43:24.167
He's a developer.

43:24.839 --> 43:26.654
Jesus fuck, he's really legit ?

43:26.811 --> 43:28.360
Well, you real police ?

43:28.970 --> 43:31.958
Now that he's out in the open,
why don't you pull him up and ask him ?

43:32.928 --> 43:35.164
You need a few days,
I'll stall Daniels.

43:35.197 --> 43:38.246
But after that, you come home
with a case we can use

43:38.293 --> 43:41.531
or you swallow your got-damn
pride and rejoin this unit.

43:52.330 --> 43:53.441
How you doin', Donette ?

44:00.984 --> 44:02.111
I'm fine, String.

44:02.565 --> 44:03.425
I missed you, baby.

44:06.402 --> 44:08.858
Look, I'm sorry for
not returning them calls.

44:09.422 --> 44:11.269
Sorry don't keep
my bed warm at night.

44:11.956 --> 44:13.098
Shorty, I been runnin'.

44:13.926 --> 44:15.992
Ain't like I'm trying
to shut you out

44:16.067 --> 44:18.055
I just got business
to attend to,
