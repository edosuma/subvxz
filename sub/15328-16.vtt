- You can't just take over
the bathroom for an hour

00:03.503 --> 00:05.088
and then sit in
there doing nothing.

00:05.171 --> 00:06.756
- I wasn't doing nothing.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.758
I was replacing
something you used

00:08.842 --> 00:10.802
with something
you shouldn't.

00:10.885 --> 00:12.262
- What is it?

00:12.345 --> 00:14.139
- You'll find out when you're
doing the thing that requires

00:14.222 --> 00:18.309
the stuff that is now
something else.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.186
- Could we have at
least one morning

00:20.270 --> 00:22.313
without you two going
at each other's throats?

00:22.397 --> 00:24.607
Charlie, we need
to deal with this.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.443
- We do?

00:26.526 --> 00:29.863
Yes, yes, we do, and...

00:29.946 --> 00:32.115
Oh, someone had
a heart attack.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.118
- Uh, honey, that beeper
didn't even beep.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.829
- Can't hear ya.
Gotta save a life. Bye!

00:37.912 --> 00:39.581
- Well, it looks
like you're gonna have to

00:39.664 --> 00:41.249
deal with us
all by yourself.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.084
- Unh-unh. Go to school.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.919
- Fine. But if I have to
ride in the car with him,

00:45.003 --> 00:47.964
I'm gonna need something to
chew on that isn't his head.

00:48.047 --> 00:50.341
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.510
Why are you all up
in my fruity yoots?

00:52.594 --> 00:54.387
- Because I ate mine.
I want more.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.222
- Gabby, Gabby,
Grandma Maggie made enough

00:56.306 --> 00:58.057
of those fruity yoots
for each of you.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.976
If you already ate yours,
then that's it.

01:00.059 --> 01:01.519
- That's an awful big to-do

01:01.603 --> 01:03.646
over Grandma Maggie's
healthy fruit snacks.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.441
I tossed mine
in the flower pot.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.485
- Why would you
throw those away?

01:08.568 --> 01:10.570
- Uh, healthy fruit snacks.

01:10.653 --> 01:14.699
Pass. Mail 'em to
Michelle Obama.

01:14.783 --> 01:19.329
- What? They're the greatest
snack in the history of snacks!

01:19.412 --> 01:21.831
Like that dream where I'm
sitting on Santa's lap,

01:21.915 --> 01:23.958
the the Easter Bunny
sits on my lap.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.753
Then we all double-Dutch
with licorice.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.674
- Okay, no more fruity yoots
before bed, all right, big guy?

01:31.758 --> 01:33.510
If Grandma Maggie
gives you any more,

01:33.593 --> 01:35.512
then I call dibs because
everyone loves them,

01:35.595 --> 01:39.390
and everyone I give them to
loves me--and I love that.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.851
- Hm, this is actually
pretty good.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.938
It starts of fruity
and then it turns yooty.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.398
- You ate my fruity yoot?

01:47.482 --> 01:48.900
Stephanie!!

01:48.983 --> 01:51.027

01:51.110 --> 01:52.320

01:53.988 --> 01:55.615
Punish him!

01:55.698 --> 01:57.867

all to go to school?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.661
Look, we'll get Grandma Maggie

01:59.744 --> 02:01.538

come over today?

02:03.706 --> 02:06.376

03:04.934 --> 03:06.269
{\an8}- Fine.

eavesdropping?

03:38.176 --> 03:39.594

03:39.677 --> 03:41.220
It got quiet and I
thought one of you

03:41.304 --> 03:44.057
might have smothered
the other one.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.975
As soon as I saw
you getting along,

03:46.059 --> 03:48.353
I was physically
unable to move.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.229
- You'd let us sell
stuff out of the garage?

getting along,

I'd let you
sell the garage.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.487
James, don't sell
the garage.

If she knows we're selling them,
she'll want a cut.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.748
She's a hostile takeover
waiting to happen.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.751
At least, that's what
me from Legal says.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.503
- Then how are we
gonna get more product?

- I'll just very sweetly ask
her to make us a couple hundred.

- Unh-unh, maybe I
should ask her.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.471

That way you never have to

- At least I've
got friends.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.451
- I got friends, too--

08:55.534 --> 08:59.080
Andy Jackson
and Benjie Franklin.

08:59.163 --> 09:00.456
- Friends, money.

09:00.539 --> 09:03.209
The important thing is you
guys came together and--

09:03.292 --> 09:04.877
Hold up. You got Franklins?

09:04.961 --> 09:06.879
- Imagine how much more
we would have made

09:06.963 --> 09:08.923
if Aaron hadn't
belly-flopped on the table

09:09.006 --> 09:12.093
and gobbled down
the rest of our product.

09:12.176 --> 09:15.054
- I told you to
keep the line moving.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.639
- Aaron, what were
you doing down there?

09:16.722 --> 09:18.474
- I saw a fruity yoot
under the couch.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.810
Then my arm got stuck.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.144
- Aaron, haven't
you had enough?

09:22.228 --> 09:24.146
You ate half our product.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.274
- Yeah, buddy, why don't you
grab some water and settle down.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.442
- Water? I don't need
no stinkin' water!

09:28.526 --> 09:30.945
Gimme my yoots!

09:31.028 --> 09:32.655
- We're all out of fruity yoots.
What are we gonna do?

09:32.738 --> 09:35.449
- Why don't you just
tell my mom you sold out

09:35.533 --> 09:37.285
and you need her
to make you some more?

09:37.368 --> 09:39.328
- Here's the thing--she doesn't
know we're selling 'em.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.289
- Oh, yes, she does!

09:41.372 --> 09:43.833
There's nothing
that you all do

09:43.916 --> 09:46.127

09:49.422 --> 09:51.048

09:51.132 --> 09:53.467
- The little one called
me beggin' for fruity yoots--

09:53.551 --> 09:55.511
in the middle
of my prayer circle.

09:55.594 --> 09:58.222
Ohh, I had to pray
real hard not to do

09:59.640 --> 10:03.269
with something I keep
in my trunk.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.937
- We'll cut you in for half,

10:05.021 --> 10:07.023
but you have to start
making more right now.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.649
- No, thanks.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.652
- It's half of that.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.988
- You got Franklins.

10:14.071 --> 10:18.409
Grab me a sack of nectarines
and some parsnips.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.453
- Hold up.
I'm not cuttin' you in.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.830
Can't we just call you on your
birthday or something?

10:22.913 --> 10:24.540
- If she doesn't make more,

10:24.623 --> 10:26.667
you get a hundred
percent of nothing.

10:26.751 --> 10:27.460

parsnips

10:31.589 --> 10:33.215
I can make my own yoots.

to cook anything.

with Grandma Maggie.

supposed to be working together.

working together.

express to Populartown.

to use baking soda.

part important?

takes so long.

how to make them.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.088
- We padlocked the garage.

18:10.172 --> 18:15.803
And now you have no
place left to sell.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.805
- I'm selling in the front yard!
- I'm selling in the back!

18:17.888 --> 18:20.849
- I'm selling in the driveway!

18:20.933 --> 18:26.105
- I'm begging in the driveway.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.981
- Any more bright ideas?

18:28.065 --> 18:29.691
- That was your idea.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.236
- Oh? You remembered that?

18:35.239 --> 18:36.907
- Something's wrong.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.742
All the popular Seniors
unfriended me.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.035
I think we've been hacked.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.579
- CHARLIE & STEPHANIE:
Hmmm...

18:42.663 --> 18:43.914
- STEPHANIE: That's a shame.
- JAMES: I don't get it.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.625
There are no customers
out there.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.710
Did something happen
to our neighborhood?

18:48.794 --> 18:51.797
Are we under a dome?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.716
- Nobody bother me.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.887
I want some private
time with my yoots.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.557
- You got all the yoots?
What'd you do to Grandma Maggie?

19:01.640 --> 19:03.517
- I'm fine.
I let him have them--

19:03.600 --> 19:05.394
since nobody's buying
'em anymore.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.563
- Nobody's even buying
the good ones?

19:07.646 --> 19:09.273
What's that about?

19:09.356 --> 19:11.358
- Do you want to do
the honors or should I?

19:11.441 --> 19:13.235
- Go ahead.
It was your idea.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.321
- Oh, gather around,
children.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.073
Mom, you count
as children.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.741
- Oh.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.287
- Hello, young people.

19:23.370 --> 19:27.082
I'm Dr. Charlie Phillips
and I have an M.D. in "Cool."

19:27.165 --> 19:28.750
You know, when I come home
from the hospital,

19:28.834 --> 19:31.336
I like to sit down with
a crossword puzzle

19:31.420 --> 19:32.170
and a wholesome snack.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.048
Oh, honey, what's
a ten-letter word

19:35.132 --> 19:38.635
for "nutritious"
and "delicious"?

19:38.719 --> 19:41.972
Well, doggone it, it's right
here in front of me.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.433
Fruity yoot!

19:47.811 --> 19:48.896
- You didn't!
- STEPHANIE: [laughing]

19:48.979 --> 19:52.566
Oh, look, 50,000
hits already.

19:52.649 --> 19:55.068
- CHARLIE: Ho, ho!
- GABBY: You ruined us.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.321
Fruity yoots will
never be cool again.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.615
- Well, we had a good run.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.284
Grandma Maggie, do you
make anything else?

20:02.367 --> 20:04.411
- I make a mean
peanut cluster!

20:04.494 --> 20:06.413
- Oh, that works.
Let's go.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.332
- Gabby, fire up
the Instagram.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.375
- Okay. How good are these?
- Oh, they're good!

20:10.459 --> 20:12.252
- Can I get a sample?
- OTHERS: No!

20:14.755 --> 20:16.757
- Great. It's starting
all over again.

20:16.840 --> 20:20.886
- You know what to do.

20:20.969 --> 20:23.305
Hi, I'm Dr. Charlie Phillips.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.766
How nifty is
the peanut cluster?

20:25.849 --> 20:28.644
It's super nifty.
