00:00.007 --> 00:01.706
Previously on "Shades of Blue"...

00:01.709 --> 00:03.482
- What is it you want?
- If you can't get me

00:03.507 --> 00:05.207
the mastermind behind this heist,

00:05.209 --> 00:06.808
I'm looking at exactly what I want.

00:06.810 --> 00:08.143
Where's Linklater?

00:08.145 --> 00:10.302
If the money isn't deposited in a week,

00:11.311 --> 00:13.177
they'll send those incriminating
photos to the Feds.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.410
Miguel, I'm gonna give you
the money I promised you,

00:15.412 --> 00:16.978
and you're gonna disappear.

00:16.980 --> 00:18.740
You paid him to go away?

00:23.987 --> 00:26.521
Some weeks ago, you violently
pulled one of my associates,

00:26.523 --> 00:28.890
Detective Donald Pomp,
out of a deposition.

00:28.892 --> 00:30.959
- Is there a question?
- He's been missing

00:30.961 --> 00:31.969
for over three weeks.

00:31.971 --> 00:33.061
Donnie's dead.

00:33.063 --> 00:35.597
Loman killed him in self-defense.

00:37.755 --> 00:38.967
I've never risked what we have.

00:38.969 --> 00:40.001
Not for anything. You know that,

00:40.003 --> 00:41.169
and you know how I feel about you.

00:41.171 --> 00:44.105
That's Donnie. The first one.

00:44.107 --> 00:45.340
What?

00:45.342 --> 00:47.168
I want to be with you, Matt.

00:49.212 --> 00:51.413
Spending time with your rat.

00:54.184 --> 00:55.183
Let him go!

00:55.185 --> 00:56.151
Whose side are you on?

00:56.153 --> 00:57.419
I'm on your side!

01:30.303 --> 01:32.203
Oh, God.

01:32.205 --> 01:33.972
Oh, God.

01:52.476 --> 01:54.109
In an effort to put some room
between herself

01:54.111 --> 01:57.245
and her opponent,
mayoral candidate Julia Ayres

01:57.247 --> 02:00.081
touted her tough-on-crime
position at a local rally.

02:00.083 --> 02:02.984
I created the Community Crime Initiative

02:02.986 --> 02:06.387
to continue the sacred mission
I took on as an NYPD officer,

02:06.389 --> 02:10.225
and I will keep up that fight
as your next mayor.

02:27.168 --> 02:29.344
Working on a new piece
for the next recital?

02:29.346 --> 02:30.603
Yeah.

02:30.605 --> 02:32.714
Something you're excited about?

02:32.716 --> 02:34.282
Uh-huh.

02:34.284 --> 02:37.060
Anything you want to share
with interested parties?

02:37.062 --> 02:38.238
Maybe a title?

02:38.263 --> 02:42.132
Um, the last two pages didn't print out.

03:33.986 --> 03:36.086
I got to go.

03:36.088 --> 03:37.758
Break a leg.

03:38.424 --> 03:41.324
- Thanks.
- Love you.

03:41.326 --> 03:42.859
Love you too.

04:17.112 --> 04:18.392
- Hands!
- Don't move.

04:18.416 --> 04:20.846
- Hey, right there. Don't move.
- Keep 'em up.

04:24.319 --> 04:27.387
- Nate?
- Hi, Dad.

04:31.093 --> 04:33.689
A full tactical unit?

04:34.663 --> 04:36.496
I guess if I was you,
I wouldn't like my odds

04:36.498 --> 04:37.931
one-on-one lately either.

04:37.933 --> 04:39.833
Everything's risk/reward, Harlee.

04:39.835 --> 04:42.068
And lately, you are not worth the risk.

04:42.070 --> 04:45.105
Yeah? Let me know
when you really believe that.

04:45.107 --> 04:48.358
Will you fan out please?
Give us some space.

04:50.179 --> 04:51.545
So, this is what? You're letting me know

04:51.547 --> 04:53.063
you're king of the mountain again?

04:53.065 --> 04:54.214
No. I'm here to give you a ride.

04:54.216 --> 04:55.549
I'm a big girl.
I can get to work on my own.

04:55.551 --> 04:58.485
No, but then you'll miss
a front-row seat

04:58.487 --> 05:00.539
to the arrests of Detective Nazario,

05:00.566 --> 05:01.431
Detective Tufo...

05:01.456 --> 05:02.506
You don't want to do that, all right?

05:02.508 --> 05:03.517
It ends your case.

05:03.519 --> 05:05.442
Wozniak is a big boy. He made a deal.

05:05.444 --> 05:06.476
He gives me evidence

05:06.478 --> 05:08.912
Councilwoman Julia Ayres is dirty,

05:08.914 --> 05:09.980
or your crew goes down.

05:09.982 --> 05:12.849
Last night, he made his choice.

05:12.851 --> 05:13.817
All right, let me talk to him.

05:14.149 --> 05:17.020
The man nearly crushed
my windpipe last night.

05:17.022 --> 05:18.955
I think he's beyond listening to reason.

05:18.957 --> 05:20.824
Look, if you knew Wozniak
the way you think you do,

05:20.826 --> 05:24.094
you wouldn't have gone
full scorched earth.

05:24.385 --> 05:26.330
Deep down, he wants to forgive me.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.982
Just let me get him down to a simmer,

05:28.984 --> 05:32.052
and maybe I can fix this.

05:39.354 --> 05:41.294
Exploiting a man's attachment
to you does seem

05:41.296 --> 05:43.129
to be your specialty.

05:44.967 --> 05:46.533
Speaking of admirers,
when's the last time

05:46.535 --> 05:48.273
you heard from Miguel?

05:50.473 --> 05:51.538
Hasn't bothered me in weeks.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.873
Just the same,
I promised I'd check up on him

05:53.875 --> 05:54.975
from time to time, and as you know,

05:54.977 --> 05:56.325
I'm a man of my word.

05:56.327 --> 05:57.538
When it suits you.

05:57.540 --> 05:59.045
Miguel dropped off the grid.

05:59.047 --> 06:00.914
He's disappeared. He's invisible.

06:00.916 --> 06:02.485
And that makes him dangerous.

06:02.510 --> 06:04.884
Well, maybe he realized
I'm a game he can't win,

06:04.886 --> 06:05.986
and he gave up.

06:05.988 --> 06:06.953
Hopeful theory.

06:06.955 --> 06:09.823
I can confirm it when I track him down.

06:09.825 --> 06:10.890
Unless there's some reason
you don't want me

06:10.892 --> 06:12.558
looking into Miguel.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.645
Whatever keeps you off my block.

06:23.210 --> 06:26.846
If you see Mom's leather coat,
let me know. I'll pick it up.

06:31.019 --> 06:33.300
Whiskey breakfast, huh?

06:34.689 --> 06:37.279
Find any answers
at the bottom of the bottle?

06:38.181 --> 06:40.834
No, but I've got two more.

06:41.796 --> 06:45.164
I'll leave you and your buddy
to your search, then.

06:45.618 --> 06:46.899
Hey, Nate?

06:47.478 --> 06:50.014
Tell your mom hi for me, will you?

06:51.254 --> 06:53.535
What did you do this time, Dad?

06:57.937 --> 07:02.618
You know, I was dating Jay four months

07:02.643 --> 07:05.467
before he finally cornered me
and asked me to tell him

07:05.492 --> 07:08.485
just one story about you
that doesn't end with,

07:08.554 --> 07:10.650
"Because my dad is an ass. That's why."

07:10.718 --> 07:13.996
And he's still waiting.
I get it. I get it.

07:14.065 --> 07:15.361
Little league.

07:16.385 --> 07:18.085
I missed a fly ball,

07:18.153 --> 07:20.687
and Coach yanked me out.

07:20.756 --> 07:22.189
You and I practiced pop-ups for weeks.

07:22.257 --> 07:24.194
He still wouldn't give me another shot,

07:24.263 --> 07:27.627
so you...,

07:28.221 --> 07:30.501
you walk me out to left field,

07:30.999 --> 07:33.033
tell the kid out there to get lost.

07:33.102 --> 07:34.412
Yeah.

07:34.599 --> 07:38.734
And that cocky little jerk
nearly pissed himself.

07:41.272 --> 07:44.140
Yeah, and you stayed
by the fence the whole game,

07:44.208 --> 07:46.322
daring Coach to take me out.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.214
You know, when there's not
a straight line to something,

07:51.283 --> 07:55.851
you always find another way.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.339
It's the one thing I like about you.

08:02.581 --> 08:06.695
I don't think I left myself
a way back on this one.

08:07.925 --> 08:09.529
So get a bulldozer.

08:11.125 --> 08:12.768
Make one.

08:25.622 --> 08:28.056
Next time you put a gun to my head,

08:28.125 --> 08:29.157
make sure you pull the trigger.

08:29.226 --> 08:32.527
Killing a federal officer is
a death-penalty case.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.258
So you're welcome.

08:35.164 --> 08:36.631
Linda left me.

08:37.369 --> 08:40.835
That spineless albino played
a conversation for her.

08:40.904 --> 08:44.320
From my private life. Me and Donnie.

08:44.388 --> 08:46.179
In my office.

08:47.694 --> 08:51.019
Yeah. That recording. The one you made.

08:51.748 --> 08:54.682
You could've let me know about that one.

08:55.444 --> 08:56.633
I didn't say anything

08:56.658 --> 08:58.950
because it didn't change anything.

08:59.791 --> 09:02.095
Doesn't change anything?

09:03.623 --> 09:05.560
You should've warned me, Harlee.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.156
And what was I gonna say?

09:07.576 --> 09:09.309
Stahl has a nuke?

09:09.378 --> 09:10.277
That would've made you feel better?

09:10.346 --> 09:11.778
No, what's gonna make me feel better is

09:11.847 --> 09:15.716
to get everybody off the hook,
and I'm gonna do it my way.

09:15.784 --> 09:18.252
Woz, there's no road out of this

09:18.320 --> 09:19.620
that doesn't go through Julia.

09:19.688 --> 09:21.255
Then I'll build a new one.

09:21.323 --> 09:23.123
I'm ending this today.

09:23.192 --> 09:25.192
Let me watch your back.

09:25.261 --> 09:28.962
I'll go with somebody who
hasn't plunged a knife in it.

09:38.729 --> 09:40.807
I got an off-the-books mission.

09:41.384 --> 09:43.777
Right now. No questions asked.

09:44.349 --> 09:45.812
Someone might get bloody.

09:45.881 --> 09:47.948
Are you buying the coffee?

09:48.574 --> 09:49.683
I'll be outside.

09:49.752 --> 09:50.884
All right.

09:51.548 --> 09:53.687
And I thought kid's puke was
a bad way to start off the day.

09:53.756 --> 09:55.822
We're on the same shooting
re-qualification schedule.

09:55.891 --> 09:57.925
You shouldn't be due again for months.

09:57.994 --> 09:59.793
Yeah. It doesn't smell right.
Out of the blue,

09:59.861 --> 10:01.482
they move it up to this afternoon?

10:01.507 --> 10:02.339
But you're good to go.

10:02.364 --> 10:03.750
I mean, your shoulder's
holding up, right?

10:03.775 --> 10:04.831
Oh, yeah, painkillers and rest

10:04.900 --> 10:07.534
are a gunshot wound's best friend.

10:08.146 --> 10:11.259
You might want to keep it down
a few decibels.

10:11.539 --> 10:13.239
The Internal Affairs guy's back,

10:13.468 --> 10:15.234
taking up residence.

10:17.422 --> 10:18.882
Can he do that?

10:19.391 --> 10:20.723
How much you want to bet
that ferret's the reason

10:20.792 --> 10:22.132
my re-qual got pushed up?

10:22.157 --> 10:23.466
Detective Espada.

10:24.596 --> 10:26.072
You drew the short one today.

10:26.097 --> 10:27.196
Can I see you in my office, please?

10:27.265 --> 10:28.831
Your office, is it?

10:29.383 --> 10:31.892
You know, squatting is illegal
in this city.

10:32.203 --> 10:35.239
Just 'cause I said "please"
doesn't make it a request.

10:35.540 --> 10:38.408
Detective Loman, you too, buddy.

10:38.476 --> 10:40.143
Come on.

10:42.013 --> 10:43.300
Yeah.

10:44.048 --> 10:46.315
One, two, three. Come on.

10:46.384 --> 10:47.884
Watch your toes, boys.

10:47.952 --> 10:48.918
There we are.

10:48.987 --> 10:50.987
Will this be acceptable, miss?

10:51.055 --> 10:53.022
I haven't been called "miss"
since my debut.

10:53.091 --> 10:54.857
This guy.

10:54.926 --> 10:55.792
Oh, Detective Loman,

10:55.860 --> 10:57.423
while I got you back there, do you mind

10:57.448 --> 10:58.928
if I throw a few questions at you?

10:58.997 --> 11:01.030
The rookie was about
to step in on a line-up for me.

11:01.099 --> 11:04.755
I got a tight schedule.
Find somebody else.

11:09.183 --> 11:10.849
Shut the door behind you.

11:14.855 --> 11:15.854
It's terrible, isn't it?

11:15.923 --> 11:18.290
That feeling that somebody's lurking,

11:18.359 --> 11:19.625
looking over your shoulder.

11:19.693 --> 11:21.560
Drives me nuts.

11:21.629 --> 11:24.054
Nah. No, I'm good.

11:25.299 --> 11:28.238
Do you know why you're here,
Detective Loman?

11:29.136 --> 11:31.303
Because you trapped me
on the wrong side of your desk.

11:31.372 --> 11:32.938
Yeah.

11:33.007 --> 11:35.107
No, I mean here here.

11:35.175 --> 11:38.511
On Wozniak's aptly named "Garbage Unit."

11:39.179 --> 11:41.280
- I was assigned here.
- Hmm.

11:41.348 --> 11:43.309
After patrol.

11:44.652 --> 11:47.019
Did you know that he
specifically requested you?

11:47.087 --> 11:49.321
Went over people's heads.
Feelings were hurt.

11:49.857 --> 11:52.689
I don't blame him.
You know, Phi Beta Kappa,

11:52.789 --> 11:54.259
top of your academy class.

11:54.328 --> 11:55.495
I admire you, Michael.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.407
May I call you Michael?

11:58.476 --> 12:00.419
If you have to.

12:01.312 --> 12:04.213
Do you really think you're an
ideal candidate for this crew?

12:04.282 --> 12:05.726
Yeah.

12:06.251 --> 12:08.741
We take out the trash no one else can.

12:08.810 --> 12:10.841
I get the concept. You know,

12:10.872 --> 12:12.855
it's just that every member
of his team has a role.

12:12.924 --> 12:17.310
Right? Harlee is the surrogate daughter.

12:17.335 --> 12:20.369
Tess is the perp whisperer.
Espada, the heavy lifter.

12:20.438 --> 12:22.605
Tufo, a loyal foot soldier.

12:22.674 --> 12:24.763
Ever wonder what yours is?

12:26.810 --> 12:29.212
I think I'll go
with paperwork completer.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.180
- Ah.
- You know, they treat my desk

12:31.249 --> 12:33.216
like it's an inbox.

12:33.284 --> 12:35.142
Yeah.

12:36.321 --> 12:38.154
I hope you're right.

12:38.719 --> 12:39.918
See, I have a different theory, Michael.

12:39.987 --> 12:41.604
I think you're the fall guy.

12:45.492 --> 12:47.592
You keep popping those pain
pills like they're breath mints.

12:47.661 --> 12:49.405
Well, it's not about willpower.

12:49.474 --> 12:51.596
Once I get through
this shooting re-qual today,

12:51.665 --> 12:53.409
I'll go cold turkey.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.605
Dozen cream-filleds.

12:55.674 --> 12:57.142
On a scale of one to somebody died,

12:57.211 --> 12:58.043
how bad is it?

12:58.112 --> 13:01.246
A strong eight. And rising.

13:01.315 --> 13:02.614
We have a new guest.

13:03.046 --> 13:04.279
Tom Verco.

13:04.347 --> 13:06.347
IA bloodhound who brought down
half the 42 precinct

13:06.416 --> 13:07.916
on that payola scam.

13:07.984 --> 13:09.317
He's here sniffing around about Donnie.

13:09.838 --> 13:11.452
And you guys are just sitting here

13:11.521 --> 13:12.654
while Loman gets in the ring with him?

13:12.722 --> 13:15.056
I tried to chaperone. Invitation only.

13:18.447 --> 13:19.596
Then you get one.

13:21.798 --> 13:24.165
Sorry to interrupt.
I need Detective Loman.

13:24.234 --> 13:25.863
Ah, Detective Santos.
We haven't met yet.

13:25.932 --> 13:27.429
I'm Tom Verco. Internal Affairs.

13:27.498 --> 13:29.204
I know. String of high-value burglaries

13:29.272 --> 13:30.238
that Loman's been working.

13:30.307 --> 13:32.373
That longshoreman that we talked
to last week,

13:32.442 --> 13:34.242
he called... he said he might have
some information

13:34.311 --> 13:35.860
on the Caruso shipment,

13:35.885 --> 13:37.702
but he leaves for Virginia in two hours.

13:37.771 --> 13:40.571
Yeah. Cargo containers on the docks.

13:40.656 --> 13:41.685
I mean, Commissioner's office
has been all over us on it.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.312
Far be it for me to keep a case closure

13:43.380 --> 13:45.242
off the CompStat report, huh?

13:45.311 --> 13:46.777
May I see that?

13:50.716 --> 13:52.016
Have you seen Detective Tufo,
by the way?

13:52.084 --> 13:54.451
I still haven't had the pleasure.

13:54.520 --> 13:55.953
You working a case
or running for office?

13:56.022 --> 13:57.521
No, no, I don't have
the stomach for politics.

13:57.590 --> 13:59.423
I am formally opening a file

13:59.492 --> 14:01.358
on Donnie Pomp's disappearance, though.

14:01.427 --> 14:03.294
I look forward to interviewing you.

14:03.362 --> 14:05.863
I'm ready whenever you are.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.865
You'll know when I'm ready.

14:15.393 --> 14:17.741
Hold up. Donnie Pomp had an inside man?

14:17.810 --> 14:21.275
Posed as a DEA agent named Linklater.

14:21.300 --> 14:22.633
And this guy helped Donnie rip us off?

14:22.702 --> 14:25.710
Well, Linklater's an alias.
The guy's a ghost.

14:25.779 --> 14:27.338
Who do you think haunts this chop shop?

14:27.406 --> 14:29.607
I looked through three years'
worth of mug shots

14:29.675 --> 14:31.275
before I found this messenger.

14:37.116 --> 14:39.257
We don't do walk-ins, yo.

14:39.282 --> 14:41.804
Make an exception, yo.

14:42.622 --> 14:45.195
Hard to forget a pretty face
like this, isn't it?

14:45.220 --> 14:47.155
Look. You and me, we got no beef.

14:47.180 --> 14:50.582
Oh, we have a big,
juicy porterhouse, my friend.

14:50.997 --> 14:52.496
No, no, no.

14:52.565 --> 14:54.965
This is the part where you tell us

14:55.034 --> 14:55.833
where you stashed our money.

14:55.901 --> 14:57.635
Linklater.

14:57.703 --> 14:59.236
How do we find him?

14:59.305 --> 15:01.696
You don't.
Linklater ain't even his name.

15:01.764 --> 15:04.174
I don't care if his name is
Rumplestiltskin.

15:04.243 --> 15:06.343
He's your boss. How does he
reach out to you?

15:06.412 --> 15:09.246
He's not my boss. I run errands for him.

15:09.315 --> 15:11.749
Look. I get a call. I get paid.

15:11.817 --> 15:13.717
Come on, man. I'm telling you straight.

15:13.786 --> 15:15.519
I do a job. I get paid.
I've never even met him.

15:15.588 --> 15:17.321
I hope you can stroke
with your other hand,

15:17.390 --> 15:18.874
or else you're in for a dry spell.

15:18.943 --> 15:19.990
There's a dummy phone number.

15:20.059 --> 15:21.975
You leave a message.
Maybe he calls you back.

15:22.044 --> 15:23.360
Aah! Aah, please! Aah!

15:30.520 --> 15:31.854
Hey.

15:32.590 --> 15:34.338
You got a search warrant for that?

15:34.586 --> 15:35.685
Going through my desk?

15:35.754 --> 15:37.837
Wozniak got locked out
of Murphy's Tavern.

15:37.906 --> 15:39.572
He needs the master keys.

15:39.641 --> 15:41.441
He's hitting the bar
before it even opens?

15:41.509 --> 15:42.642
That's a cry for help.

15:42.711 --> 15:44.377
Did he call a freezer meet?

15:44.446 --> 15:47.413
No. He wasn't filling in many blanks.

15:47.482 --> 15:49.716
All right, well, I'll drop them off.

15:49.784 --> 15:52.785
I need to fill him in on
our little house mouse anyway.

15:56.827 --> 15:57.960
Mrs. Zepeda?

15:58.133 --> 16:00.643
I'm not buying anything,
and I already know my savior.

16:00.712 --> 16:03.154
I'm not selling anything. I promise.

16:03.308 --> 16:04.473
William Clark.

16:04.542 --> 16:06.429
I was hoping I could talk to Miguel.

16:07.312 --> 16:09.662
Men who get in fights aren't the kind

16:09.731 --> 16:11.465
I want talking to my son.

16:11.490 --> 16:13.473
Oh, no. This...

16:13.718 --> 16:16.786
this is from a parent upset
over his visitation schedule.

16:16.854 --> 16:20.506
I'm an investigator working with
Baron and Rosenberg,

16:20.575 --> 16:21.941
attorneys-at-law.

16:22.010 --> 16:24.010
Your son paid my associates
a visit last month.

16:24.078 --> 16:26.979
He's looking to establish
paternity for his daughter.

16:27.048 --> 16:30.016
He's fighting for custody of Cristina?

16:32.820 --> 16:34.420
I thought you needed the keys.

16:34.489 --> 16:36.085
Patience ain't one of Wozniak's

16:36.110 --> 16:37.666
more pronounced virtues.

16:37.691 --> 16:39.692
Ugh. Looks like our bar tab
just got bigger.

16:39.761 --> 16:41.327
We got a lead on the heist money.

16:41.396 --> 16:43.362
Turns out Donnie was working
with a partner.

16:43.431 --> 16:45.765
Some dude by the name of Linklater.

16:45.833 --> 16:47.466
I doubt he's using Murphy's Tavern

16:47.535 --> 16:49.602
as a secret hideout.

16:49.671 --> 16:53.706
We found the guy's errand boy,
made him place a call.

16:53.775 --> 16:56.642
Holding him in the freezer
till his boss hits him back.

16:59.616 --> 17:02.050
Head back to the precinct.
I'm tapping you out.

17:02.669 --> 17:05.549
You get a new set of LT
stripes when I wasn't looking?

17:06.056 --> 17:07.823
There has to be
some sugar back here, right?

17:07.891 --> 17:11.425
There's an IA detective. Verco.

17:11.494 --> 17:13.561
He's kicking up dirt on Donnie Pomp.

17:13.630 --> 17:14.930
My phone ain't ringing.

17:14.998 --> 17:17.699
That's not how this guy operates.

17:17.768 --> 17:20.368
Go push paper around
on the cargo burglaries.

17:20.436 --> 17:22.076
Back up how I sprung Loman.

17:22.144 --> 17:24.071
Yo, are we worried about this guy?

17:24.469 --> 17:26.273
Yo, where am I?

17:26.798 --> 17:28.060
Freezing.

17:29.279 --> 17:31.680
Cold's good for the swelling.

17:32.282 --> 17:32.980
Nice.

17:33.180 --> 17:36.014
I'm dying, and you got jokes.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.983
I've seen dying, Cal.

17:38.052 --> 17:39.683
You ain't there yet.

17:41.822 --> 17:43.922
- Got a minute, boss?
- Haven't you learned anything

17:43.991 --> 17:45.123
from gym class?

17:45.192 --> 17:46.591
When you don't get picked,

17:46.660 --> 17:49.416
be a big girl... stay on the sideline.

17:51.598 --> 17:53.198
And the game is Linklater?

17:53.267 --> 17:55.634
The FBI has priorities.

17:55.702 --> 17:58.070
He's higher than Julia
on their wish list.

17:58.138 --> 18:00.472
If you can flush him out,
if you can catch him.

18:00.541 --> 18:03.542
See? This.
This is why I didn't tell you.

18:03.610 --> 18:06.912
You should have. This guy
operates on a whole other level.

18:06.980 --> 18:08.980
And even if I thought this was
a suicide mission,

18:09.049 --> 18:10.949
and I do, I would've helped you.

18:11.018 --> 18:12.751
And then Tufo wouldn't be involved.

18:12.820 --> 18:14.820
Tufo does what he's asked.

18:14.888 --> 18:16.822
And he protects the family.

18:16.890 --> 18:19.591
Making things right is on me,
is on my shoulders.

18:19.660 --> 18:21.660
Not Tufo's. Not the crew's.

18:25.118 --> 18:26.846
You want to be a martyr?

18:27.710 --> 18:29.484
Make yourself comfortable.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.151
Yeah. We only met once,

18:41.220 --> 18:44.688
but I was very impressed
with Miguel's courage

18:44.757 --> 18:47.925
and his resilience after being
wrongfully incarcerated.

18:47.993 --> 18:49.470
But we need more information from him

18:49.495 --> 18:50.794
if we're gonna take that next step.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.030
And I just... I haven't been able
to reach him.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.965
Miguel's out of town. He sent me a text

18:55.034 --> 18:58.535
that an opportunity came up
he couldn't say no to.

18:58.604 --> 18:59.837
Well, that's exciting.

19:00.166 --> 19:01.432
Did he say where he was headed?

19:01.457 --> 19:03.991
Oh, no, no. But that's my son.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.126
Before he went to prison,
he'd come, he'd go.

19:06.195 --> 19:07.995
Sometimes months in between.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.730
Monica!

19:09.799 --> 19:11.065
Apurate.

19:11.133 --> 19:12.900
You can't rush beauty, Grandma.

19:12.969 --> 19:14.635
And you're late again for choir,

19:14.704 --> 19:17.104
solving the mystery
of why you can't get a solo.

19:17.173 --> 19:19.707
You forget this part
between raising your own

19:19.775 --> 19:21.575
and having grandchildren.

19:21.644 --> 19:24.511
Yeah. I'll bet.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.046
Cristina.

19:28.353 --> 19:29.753
Do I know you?

19:29.821 --> 19:34.090
Um, Mr. Zepeda showed me a picture.

19:34.159 --> 19:36.451
Your dad hired his law firm

19:36.519 --> 19:38.461
to force your mom to let you see us.

19:38.530 --> 19:40.597
Well, he hasn't hired us yet.

19:40.666 --> 19:42.784
Just the initial meeting.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.368
He's trying to get custody?

19:45.437 --> 19:48.464
Yeah. You almost sound disappointed.

19:50.048 --> 19:51.808
He sees lawyers and then leaves town

19:51.877 --> 19:53.476
without saying good-bye?

19:53.545 --> 19:55.745
That makes zero sense.

19:56.279 --> 20:00.515
Well, custody can be
a very emotional issue.

20:00.584 --> 20:03.853
He's probably just taking
some time to think it through.

20:04.572 --> 20:08.158
Do you always pay house calls
to clients you've only met once?

20:08.588 --> 20:10.788
Is that a book on cross examination?

20:10.856 --> 20:13.557
Hey, cuz, I'm running late.
You got wheels, right?

20:13.626 --> 20:14.897
Yeah. I'll give you a ride.

20:14.966 --> 20:17.459
I should get going anyways.

20:18.172 --> 20:20.564
Hey, if... if you

20:20.633 --> 20:23.000
happen to hear from Miguel...

20:25.671 --> 20:27.431
Could you let me know?

20:27.500 --> 20:28.981
Would it be unethical to let me know?

20:29.049 --> 20:31.470
Not at all. I'll absolutely be in touch.

20:35.076 --> 20:37.076
It's really nice to meet you, Cristina.

20:45.644 --> 20:47.875
I hope we can stay
on the same page after this.

20:51.940 --> 20:55.649
One cold cup of coffee doesn't
fix everything.

21:04.961 --> 21:08.144
- Showtime.
- What if he doesn't buy it?

21:08.184 --> 21:10.418
Just take a breath
and stick to the script.

21:10.487 --> 21:12.387
No. He's too smart.
I can't convince him...

21:12.455 --> 21:14.716
Can't is not an option.

21:17.828 --> 21:18.960
Thanks for hitting me back, sir.

21:19.247 --> 21:21.295
This channel flows one way.

21:21.364 --> 21:24.718
I'm not in the market for any
assistance at the moment.

21:24.743 --> 21:26.300
Yeah, that's actually not
why I'm calling.

21:26.369 --> 21:28.770
Some FBI agents showed up at my place

21:28.838 --> 21:30.785
asking questions about the heist.

21:31.879 --> 21:32.857
Hello?

21:32.926 --> 21:34.491
How did they find you?

21:35.145 --> 21:36.811
Like they'd tell me.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.133
Look. I didn't give them nothing.

21:41.151 --> 21:42.884
Look. I've been dependable.

21:42.952 --> 21:44.660
You say jump, I'm through the roof.

21:44.780 --> 21:46.246
I need cash and IDs

21:46.315 --> 21:48.649
to disappear for a while
before they come back.

21:48.718 --> 21:51.050
That's a reasonable request.

21:51.687 --> 21:54.039
- What are their names?
- Whose names?

21:54.108 --> 21:56.521
The agents who paid you a visit.

21:57.293 --> 22:00.194
All I heard was "heist" and "Feds."

22:00.262 --> 22:01.228
I didn't listen for names.

22:01.297 --> 22:03.784
You should pay closer attention.

22:04.634 --> 22:08.002
Stahl. One of them was Agent Stahl.

22:08.071 --> 22:10.237
Riverside Park in Brooklyn.

22:10.306 --> 22:11.999
By the baseball diamond.

22:12.408 --> 22:14.759
Park bench near the third base line.

22:15.211 --> 22:16.974
Give me your description.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.343
You there?

22:19.969 --> 22:22.936
I need to know what you look
like so I can identify you.

22:23.152 --> 22:25.085
5'11".

22:25.154 --> 22:27.187
Black. Grey camo jacket.

22:27.256 --> 22:29.957
I'll see you soon. Peace.

22:30.026 --> 22:31.242
Just described Tufo.

22:31.311 --> 22:33.024
Yeah. Wish your buddy luck for me.

22:38.949 --> 22:40.803
- What the hell?
- Funny you say that,

22:40.828 --> 22:41.634
Detective Tufo.

22:41.703 --> 22:42.918
I've been chilly in here all morning,

22:42.943 --> 22:45.772
but everybody that comes in
complains about the heat.

22:46.708 --> 22:48.286
Are you a Mets fan, Marcus?

22:48.355 --> 22:50.743
Queens. Born and raised.

22:50.812 --> 22:53.479
I'm from Flushing. Had some
lean years, but now that we

22:53.548 --> 22:55.224
got Céspedes, everybody wants
on the bandwagon.

22:55.293 --> 22:56.983
I'll stop you there. I ain't your buddy,

22:57.052 --> 22:58.778
and there sure as hell ain't no "we,"

22:58.847 --> 23:00.470
so ask what you want about Donnie Pomp,

23:00.916 --> 23:02.572
and let's get this over with.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.845
I'd rather talk about you.

23:04.588 --> 23:05.615
About your devotion to your fellow cops.

23:05.683 --> 23:08.919
I get the sense that you'd take
a bullet for any one of them.

23:08.959 --> 23:09.952
Most of them, anyway.

23:10.128 --> 23:11.608
They gave you a detective badge

23:11.676 --> 23:14.290
for all those keen observational skills?

23:14.359 --> 23:15.582
Here's a question:

23:15.860 --> 23:18.927
Prison sentence. 25-to-life variety.

23:19.297 --> 23:21.668
Would you be willing to take
one of those for your unit?

23:22.934 --> 23:25.034
Oh, that reminds me.

23:25.103 --> 23:26.533
Here we go.

23:28.106 --> 23:30.173
You recognize this man?

23:34.946 --> 23:36.751
He's my brother.

23:37.982 --> 23:38.714
Wallace Tufo.

23:38.783 --> 23:40.950
Street name Crazy Eight.

23:41.019 --> 23:44.787
Banger doing year 5 of a 12-year
bit on aggravated assault.

23:44.856 --> 23:46.456
You know, I know a guy
who works gang unit.

23:46.524 --> 23:48.239
Says Crazy Eight was a good kid

23:48.293 --> 23:50.693
till he got six months
on a grand theft auto.

23:50.762 --> 23:53.830
15 years old. Might've had a future.

23:54.436 --> 23:55.949
But he got jumped in in juvie.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.633
Wallace is a good man.

23:58.303 --> 24:00.346
Made some bad friends is all.

24:00.631 --> 24:06.041
Did you know that the original
suspect in that GTA

24:06.842 --> 24:10.279
was a 13-year-old hopper
named Marcus Tufo?

24:10.826 --> 24:12.559
Wallace doesn't cop to that joyride,

24:12.628 --> 24:13.894
save his baby brother,

24:13.963 --> 24:16.997
man, your life takes
a whole different trajectory.

24:17.498 --> 24:20.834
Your brother's been up
for parole, what, three times?

24:21.450 --> 24:22.568
Four.

24:22.637 --> 24:24.221
Up again next month.

24:25.741 --> 24:28.171
I'd be willing to make a call
on his behalf.

24:28.239 --> 24:29.890
Oh, here we go, huh?

24:30.713 --> 24:32.724
We got an ID
on one of the cargo thieves.

24:32.749 --> 24:33.681
Detective Santos,

24:34.682 --> 24:36.684
do I need to hang a tie on my doorknob?

24:36.753 --> 24:38.682
You want privacy?
Go back to your IA hole.

24:38.707 --> 24:40.106
We do real police work here.

24:40.175 --> 24:42.307
We're gonna set up
at the suspect's place,

24:42.376 --> 24:43.596
hope to make a bust.

24:43.670 --> 24:45.070
Well, as much as I hate
to cut this short,

24:45.138 --> 24:46.905
you heard the lady.

24:47.266 --> 24:48.455
Duty calls.

24:51.997 --> 24:53.029
Something calls.

24:56.783 --> 24:59.584
Aren't you gonna be, like,
super late for choir?

24:59.653 --> 25:01.619
I haven't been to choir
in, like, a week.

25:01.688 --> 25:05.223
This boy I've been talking to,
Toby, balls down at the courts.

25:05.410 --> 25:07.410
I told him we'd stop by.

25:07.479 --> 25:09.579
You're sloppy.
You know, sooner or later,

25:09.648 --> 25:12.148
Grandma Lorena's gonna figure it out.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.751
go to choir,

25:14.820 --> 25:17.153
tell the teacher you feel really sick.

25:17.222 --> 25:18.255
It's a free pass all day.

25:18.323 --> 25:20.156
Look at you, bad girl.

25:20.225 --> 25:22.959
Who have you been sneaking out to meet?

25:23.028 --> 25:25.195
Grandma Lorena. And you.

25:25.264 --> 25:27.330
You have to lie to your mom
about seeing family?

25:27.399 --> 25:28.632
That's messed up.

25:28.700 --> 25:31.001
If you met my mom, you'd understand.

25:31.069 --> 25:34.104
Well, I'm glad you're taking
a walk on the wild side.

25:34.172 --> 25:37.073
It's cool to hang
with my long-lost cousin.

25:37.582 --> 25:41.978
Did you ever think about,
you know, reaching out to me?

25:42.047 --> 25:43.146
Every time anyone mentioned you,

25:43.215 --> 25:44.748
Grandma would change the subject.

25:44.816 --> 25:47.217
Said you lived out in Florida.

25:47.286 --> 25:50.720
So, she basically pretended
I didn't exist.

25:50.789 --> 25:52.289
I guess it's
just how she dealt with it...

25:52.357 --> 25:56.726
Miguel in jail, and hating
your mom for keeping you away.

25:56.795 --> 25:58.795
No offense.

25:58.864 --> 26:01.831
God, 15 years,
and I've been 15 minutes away.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.633
Just means we've got time
to make up for.

26:03.702 --> 26:05.150
Yeah.

26:09.875 --> 26:11.775
Do you have a fake or something?

26:11.843 --> 26:16.313
No. But I've got two hands
and a baby-faced cousin.

26:16.381 --> 26:20.216
Be cool, okay? The trick is
to just buy everything else.

26:28.079 --> 26:29.845
$4.35.

26:33.751 --> 26:35.083
What's in the bag?

26:35.282 --> 26:36.599
It's my books.

26:49.255 --> 26:51.147
It's not too late to call this off.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.417
No, it ain't stage fright
that's eating me.

26:55.482 --> 26:56.829
Then what?

26:57.084 --> 26:58.678
Internal Affairs?

26:59.152 --> 27:00.318
I'm good.

27:00.833 --> 27:02.509
Ten minute warning.

27:03.069 --> 27:05.005
Tufo, wait another five,

27:05.074 --> 27:06.246
and then head to the middle of the bench

27:06.314 --> 27:07.880
by the baseball field.

27:08.122 --> 27:10.756
When Linklater comes, we'll box him in.

27:10.825 --> 27:12.158
Copy that.

27:16.764 --> 27:18.364
Those gears grind any louder,

27:18.432 --> 27:20.399
I'm gonna have to turn up my walkie.

27:24.998 --> 27:28.073
In my old hood, there was
this guy at the courts.

27:28.581 --> 27:29.808
Rick.

27:29.877 --> 27:33.449
Mean as he was big,
and the dude was big.

27:35.065 --> 27:38.868
One day, this young punk decides
to step to.

27:39.664 --> 27:41.504
How'd that work out for you?

27:47.193 --> 27:49.181
Yeah, Rick is about to crack my skull

27:49.250 --> 27:51.140
when my brother Wallace shows up.

27:57.698 --> 27:59.732
The thing about Wallace is
he was the only brother

27:59.800 --> 28:01.534
in Queens playing tennis.

28:02.106 --> 28:04.467
He wanted to be the next Arthur Ashe.

28:05.730 --> 28:07.750
He's standing there with his racket

28:08.445 --> 28:09.935
and his little short shorts

28:10.004 --> 28:13.138
and these goofy wrap-around glasses.

28:13.207 --> 28:14.273
Rec-Specs.

28:14.341 --> 28:17.042
Yes. Rec... Rec-Specs.

28:21.982 --> 28:24.416
He warns Rick not to touch me again.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.026
And Rick just laughs.

28:27.188 --> 28:28.887
And Wallace goes buck wild,

28:28.956 --> 28:31.106
breaks his racket on the dude's neck.

28:35.362 --> 28:36.929
Rick never touched me again.

28:41.676 --> 28:42.975
At least it has a happy ending.

28:43.888 --> 28:47.146
The beat-down
Wallace gave Rick was nothing

28:47.215 --> 28:49.248
on the hurt he gave me when we got home.

28:49.783 --> 28:51.840
Said it was to teach me a lesson.

28:52.720 --> 28:55.769
No one can save you
from what you've got coming.

28:57.158 --> 29:00.393
I told myself
what we've been doing is right.

29:00.461 --> 29:02.495
Bending the rules to fight the bad guys.

29:02.563 --> 29:06.213
But with Sap and everything, I...

29:07.663 --> 29:09.368
I don't know.

29:11.419 --> 29:14.657
I wonder if we've been the
bullies all along, Harlee.

29:16.228 --> 29:18.707
I can't shake the feeling
that somebody's about to give us

29:18.762 --> 29:20.244
what we got coming.

29:23.663 --> 29:25.774
You need to relax.

29:27.007 --> 29:29.605
Internal Affairs is
setting up shop in there.

29:32.001 --> 29:35.119
Look, the only way he gets
anything is if we let him.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.964
Four o'clock.

29:42.450 --> 29:44.092
And I hate to keep
the douchebags waiting.

29:54.784 --> 29:55.917
Ugh!

29:59.903 --> 30:01.369
I know.

30:01.438 --> 30:02.904
You're shocked.

30:19.129 --> 30:20.596
Nice.

30:21.298 --> 30:23.225
Is that 15 rounds, center mass?

30:24.133 --> 30:25.801
Good to see your arm didn't
slow you down.

30:26.725 --> 30:28.124
You can play
all the mind games you want.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.327
Doesn't change the fact
that I'm a good cop.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.095
But are you a clean one?

30:32.097 --> 30:35.098
Drug test. A female detective
will meet you in the bathroom.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.546
Is this guy coming or what?

30:49.548 --> 30:53.149
I'm getting sideways looks from
the Mommy and Me crowd.

30:53.151 --> 30:55.852
Just keep your hands
out of your pockets.

30:59.424 --> 31:01.057
Our ghost's a no-show.

31:01.059 --> 31:02.626
I'm switching to plan B.

31:03.151 --> 31:04.661
Want to tell me what that is?

31:05.190 --> 31:07.330
You want to sound check your mic first?

31:07.550 --> 31:09.165
You know what?
Throw all the bombs you want.

31:09.167 --> 31:10.590
I'm not going anywhere.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.773
The recording of me and Donnie.

31:15.173 --> 31:17.173
Is that the only other one?

31:19.444 --> 31:20.854
No.

31:21.313 --> 31:22.711
The night that you first told me

31:22.736 --> 31:23.902
that there was a rat in the crew.

31:23.904 --> 31:26.082
Harlee, I swear to God,
if I hear something else,

31:26.084 --> 31:28.910
- I'm gonna...
- No, that's it. That's it.

31:31.504 --> 31:34.391
I'm gonna leave a message for Linklater.

31:34.393 --> 31:38.028
Myself. He'll pop his head out for that.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.214
I'll call you when he does.

31:41.199 --> 31:44.100
And get that idiot out of my freezer.

31:48.140 --> 31:51.926
Hold on, Linklater. I have
trouble avoiding potholes.

31:53.641 --> 31:56.090
I'm serious. Are you sure
he said four o'clock?

31:59.685 --> 32:01.184
Harlee?

32:01.186 --> 32:02.652
Hold on, Tufo.

32:09.027 --> 32:11.227
Detective Santos.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.764
Shoplifting 40s.

32:17.069 --> 32:20.136
That will look great on your
application to Juilliard.

32:20.138 --> 32:23.173
Oh, 'cause musicians who drink
never get anywhere in the world?

32:23.175 --> 32:25.050
You know, you're lucky that
that officer called me

32:25.052 --> 32:26.142
instead of booking you.

32:26.632 --> 32:28.244
I'm the one who convinced him
to call you.

32:28.246 --> 32:30.480
Well, am I supposed to be
impressed by that, Cristina?

32:30.482 --> 32:32.315
I don't know.

32:32.317 --> 32:34.250
God, I don't know. But at some point,

32:34.252 --> 32:36.987
you're gonna have to let me
out of the bubble wrap, Mom.

32:36.989 --> 32:39.656
And don't think I don't know
whose neighborhood that was.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.658
You mean Miguel's?

32:41.660 --> 32:43.576
Yeah. That's how family works.

32:43.578 --> 32:45.145
His family is my family.

32:45.147 --> 32:46.875
Baby,

32:48.250 --> 32:50.984
they are from a different world
than you.

32:55.190 --> 32:58.224
I don't want you making
the same mistakes I did.

33:08.637 --> 33:10.071
How much?

33:12.407 --> 33:14.526
How much did you pay him to go away?

33:17.045 --> 33:19.679
I mean, how much was his only
daughter worth to him?

33:22.134 --> 33:24.517
Baby, I'm so sorry.

33:25.203 --> 33:26.535
That's the thing, Mom.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.172
You're not sorry.

33:32.310 --> 33:34.056
Keep the doors locked.

33:35.313 --> 33:37.247
Oh, so Miguel's neighborhood
is too sketchy,

33:37.249 --> 33:39.649
but I can just wait outside a bar.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.143
Got it.

33:58.570 --> 34:01.404
Tommy was looking for you
about your guy in the freezer.

34:01.406 --> 34:03.440
Don't worry. I'm getting him
out of your hair right now.

34:08.112 --> 34:10.255
I told you I'd find you
when I was ready.

34:15.187 --> 34:18.221
Were you expecting
to find somebody else back here?

34:18.223 --> 34:20.047
Yeah. Tommy, the owner.

34:20.252 --> 34:22.851
He special orders this from Cuba for me.

34:22.877 --> 34:24.177
Can't get it in the store.

34:24.463 --> 34:25.462
You know, the strangest thing
happened to me

34:25.464 --> 34:27.764
when I flashed my badge out front.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.156
Your friend Tommy told me to wait.

34:29.181 --> 34:31.616
Then he scurried back here
and he escorted a man out.

34:32.637 --> 34:35.264
A man with a severely damaged hand.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.507
Can be a rough place.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.228
- And yet here you are.
- Yeah. Not for long.

34:40.231 --> 34:41.295
My daughter's waiting in the car.

34:41.297 --> 34:44.214
Before you go, I've been meaning to ask:

34:44.216 --> 34:46.882
the morning after Detective Pomp
was last seen,

34:46.885 --> 34:49.989
you showed up at the precinct
with a cut under your eye.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.355
I hope you stretched
before a reach like that.

34:52.357 --> 34:53.489
You're gonna pull something.

34:53.492 --> 34:56.493
I know. I know.
Normally I would agree with you.

34:56.495 --> 34:57.961
But here's where it gets spooky.

34:57.963 --> 34:59.963
Lieutenant Wozniak showed up
on the same day

34:59.965 --> 35:02.592
with gashes
on the left side of his face.

35:03.368 --> 35:06.331
I box. Local gym.

35:06.905 --> 35:09.272
Guys there don't know
how to treat a lady.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.307
You want to know what happened
to Wozniak?

35:11.309 --> 35:12.809
Knock on his office door.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.477
It's the one right across from yours.

35:14.479 --> 35:15.345
If you tap long enough,

35:15.347 --> 35:17.509
you will always find a weak spot.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.862
How else do you think
I found your freezer?

35:24.947 --> 35:26.181
You were in the Corps.

35:27.651 --> 35:29.351
I was a Ranger myself.

35:29.353 --> 35:33.155
But we had a lot of respect
for you fellas.

35:33.157 --> 35:35.257
Marines, first in, last out.

35:35.259 --> 35:37.759
I read the manual too.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.761
Establish a rapport with your captor.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.363
Get him to lower his guard.

35:41.365 --> 35:42.397
Just save it.

35:42.399 --> 35:45.066
I thought we had an
understanding, Marine.

35:45.068 --> 35:48.103
I didn't come after you.
You didn't come after me.

35:48.105 --> 35:51.473
You thought wrong, Ranger.

35:51.475 --> 35:54.376
FBI picked you up right after
the heist, didn't they?

35:54.378 --> 35:56.378
They must have ambitious plans for you

35:56.380 --> 35:58.280
since they let you walk away.

35:58.282 --> 36:01.216
They're not driving the bus anymore.

36:01.817 --> 36:03.385
I am.

36:03.387 --> 36:05.720
And you never wondered
why I didn't even blink

36:05.722 --> 36:08.857
when you cost me $12 million?

36:08.859 --> 36:13.353
It's because I'm a man who can
afford to lose $12 million.

36:14.097 --> 36:16.064
You have no idea how much I would pay

36:16.066 --> 36:18.200
for a man with your skill set.

36:25.742 --> 36:29.411
Not being a rat is payment enough.

36:34.551 --> 36:36.485
Agent Stahl.

36:36.487 --> 36:38.253
How's your face?

36:50.700 --> 36:52.184
Little on edge tonight?

36:52.827 --> 36:54.098
Put the piece away, Harlee,

36:54.100 --> 36:56.521
unless you're gonna shoot me
on your front stoop.

36:56.523 --> 36:58.123
Come at me when my daughter's home.

36:58.125 --> 36:59.524
Find out.

36:59.526 --> 37:01.276
Oh, I know
what you're capable of, Harlee.

37:01.278 --> 37:03.628
That's why I'm here.

37:03.630 --> 37:06.980
Wozniak called for an
emergency meet at a warehouse.

37:07.734 --> 37:09.361
Is it an ambush?

37:10.971 --> 37:13.738
He doesn't share his playbook
with me anymore.

37:14.187 --> 37:15.714
You made sure of that.

37:17.699 --> 37:19.494
You and I are gonna
open his surprise together.

37:19.496 --> 37:22.847
Would you holster your weapon,
and let's go.

37:22.849 --> 37:24.549
Let me say good-bye to Cristina.

37:24.551 --> 37:26.284
Two minutes.

37:37.397 --> 37:39.531
You have him, don't you? Linklater?

37:39.533 --> 37:42.601
Did Stahl call you
with a knot in his shaft?

37:42.603 --> 37:44.169
I thought we took a step today.

37:44.171 --> 37:46.084
But you were playing me the whole time.

37:46.086 --> 37:48.240
The only one I played was Linklater.

37:48.242 --> 37:50.675
Whichever way this goes,
you're in the clear.

37:50.677 --> 37:54.251
Yeah, not so much.
Stahl is bringing me with him.

37:54.615 --> 37:56.969
For some reason, he's wary of you.

37:57.851 --> 37:59.374
Woz?

38:00.587 --> 38:02.687
Can I count on you to back me?

38:21.692 --> 38:23.875
You know, there was a moment

38:23.877 --> 38:26.728
when Wozniak was choking me to death

38:26.730 --> 38:28.863
when everything went dark.

38:28.865 --> 38:31.433
There's no white lights.
There's no tunnel.

38:31.435 --> 38:32.467
There's nothing.

38:33.277 --> 38:36.538
I don't think there's
anything more after this.

38:36.540 --> 38:39.574
Maybe there is,
and you're just not going there.

38:40.142 --> 38:41.675
Maybe none of us are.

38:44.186 --> 38:46.548
At times, I've been cavalier
in my approach to you, Harlee.

38:46.550 --> 38:48.717
And I'm sorry
that things have gotten so...

38:48.719 --> 38:50.785
- Disgusting? Pathetic?
- Out of hand.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.721
That was never my intention.

38:52.723 --> 38:54.029
Yeah, I've seen the videos.

38:54.031 --> 38:55.824
I know all about your intentions.

38:55.826 --> 38:58.393
My feelings for you
are nuanced. I'll admit that.

38:58.395 --> 39:01.529
But watching you these past months,

39:01.531 --> 39:03.915
watching you fight
to keep your life whole,

39:03.917 --> 39:06.757
no matter how bad the deck's
stacked against you,

39:07.766 --> 39:08.898
I admire you.

39:12.492 --> 39:15.927
I hope we can at least be civil
to each other from now on.

39:15.929 --> 39:17.862
Let's just get this over with.

39:23.987 --> 39:26.183
Leave it to Wozniak to call a meet

39:26.185 --> 39:28.173
on the set of a horror movie.

39:28.875 --> 39:31.760
If it looks like a setup
and feels like a setup...

39:31.762 --> 39:34.062
You got no choice but to go in anyway.

39:44.858 --> 39:47.742
You brought your mommy along

39:47.744 --> 39:50.612
to hide behind her skirt again?

39:50.614 --> 39:52.511
Who the hell is this?

39:52.933 --> 39:54.966
One of your, uh, flings?

39:54.968 --> 39:56.968
Ha, ha.

39:56.970 --> 40:00.205
Meet the artist formerly known
as Terrence Linklater,

40:00.207 --> 40:04.642
AKA the ghost who masterminded
the armored car heist,

40:04.644 --> 40:05.977
in the flesh.

40:09.449 --> 40:11.049
Linklater was not your assignment.

40:11.051 --> 40:12.967
No. It was yours.

40:12.969 --> 40:14.446
And you said so yourself

40:14.471 --> 40:15.937
the night that you brought me in.

40:15.939 --> 40:18.639
Deliver the guy
who masterminded the heist,

40:18.641 --> 40:20.258
and my debt is paid.

40:20.260 --> 40:21.810
That was when I thought it was
impossible.

40:21.812 --> 40:24.446
Well, be careful who you ask
for the moon.

40:24.448 --> 40:26.448
Some maniac just might bring it to you.

40:26.450 --> 40:28.272
Yeah, well, too bad this maniac didn't

40:28.274 --> 40:29.551
read the fine print.

40:29.553 --> 40:30.985
Yeah, I'll show you the fine print.

40:30.987 --> 40:32.887
I'll stick my foot so far up your ass...

40:32.889 --> 40:34.889
Okay, Woz, easy.

40:34.891 --> 40:37.459
All right, Stahl is gonna fix this.

40:37.461 --> 40:38.993
Because like you said to me
this morning,

40:38.995 --> 40:41.529
you're a man of your word.

40:41.531 --> 40:43.565
This is out of my hands, Harlee.

40:43.567 --> 40:46.885
And it's not the agreement
Wozniak signed onto.

40:46.887 --> 40:48.520
Then why don't we just call Gail Baker,

40:48.522 --> 40:50.688
see who the bigger prize to the FBI is?

40:50.690 --> 40:53.024
A crooked councilwoman
or an enemy of the state

40:53.026 --> 40:55.319
who's already humiliated
the Bureau once.

40:56.730 --> 40:58.863
I'd weigh my options if I were you,

40:58.865 --> 41:01.032
but you don't have anything
to put on the scale.

41:01.034 --> 41:03.868
Except proof of the dirt
that you and you

41:03.870 --> 41:05.157
and your crew has done

41:05.159 --> 41:06.871
that I can submit to the NYPD.

41:06.873 --> 41:08.740
Don't forget I've got your greatest hits

41:08.742 --> 41:11.659
that I can deliver to the FBI.

41:11.661 --> 41:13.545
Mutually assured destruction.

41:13.547 --> 41:15.454
You want to play?

41:17.534 --> 41:19.768
It's a win-win, Stahl.

41:19.770 --> 41:21.936
This is a career-maker for you.

41:21.938 --> 41:24.773
Take the bust and the
corner office that goes with it,

41:24.775 --> 41:27.041
and leave us the hell alone.

41:34.518 --> 41:36.885
You know something? You two...

41:39.723 --> 41:41.923
You do make one hell of a team.

41:46.062 --> 41:49.164
We stick to the assignment. Julia Ayres.

41:50.901 --> 41:52.667
She got my partner killed.

41:54.838 --> 41:58.136
Your DNA is gonna be all over that.

41:58.975 --> 42:01.075
I suggest you get rid of the body.

42:03.480 --> 42:06.080
You know how to do that, right, Harlee?
