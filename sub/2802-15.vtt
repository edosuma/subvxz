Well, actually,
we need to talk about Stanzler.

I told you Andrew makes his money

02:19.139 --> 02:21.600
-as an energy trader, right?
-Uh, yeah.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.435
Well, actually it's worse than that.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.145
I've been working
with his assistant, Brooke.

02:25.229 --> 02:28.273
And she thinks Stanzler's involved
in creating the blackouts.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.442
-Say that again.
-Yeah.

02:30.526 --> 02:33.195
Brooke overheard Stanzler
talking about it with another trader.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.696
So she did some digging.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.241
She thinks they're withholding supply
during peak hours

02:37.324 --> 02:39.451
and then selling energy
to the city for triple the rate.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.787
El, these are very serious allegations.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.331
-Honey, I know.
-There are three confirmed deaths,

02:44.414 --> 02:46.500
and it's cost the city tens of millions.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.502
-That's why I'm telling you.
-All right.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.254
We have to bring her in to the Bureau.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.672
She doesn't wanna come in.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.591
She's terrified that someone's
gonna see her and tell Stanzler.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.885
Do you know, he actually
threatened to shoot the painter today?

02:56.969 --> 02:59.513
-Seriously?
-Well, he was half joking,

02:59.596 --> 03:01.139
but I wouldn't put it past him.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.100
Okay. So where can I talk to Brooke?

03:03.183 --> 03:05.853

-It was hot, but very interesting.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.555
What did you find?

03:41.638 --> 03:44.391
I figured out where those crates we found
were being smuggled out of.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.561
It's an estate in southern Argentina.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.314
-Love what they've done with the place.
-Yeah, someone burned it down

03:50.397 --> 03:52.482
and I'm pretty sure it was Vincent Adler.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.277

he's the single most valuable asset

10:04.271 --> 10:06.440
we have here at the Bureau.

10:06.523 --> 10:07.649
Please?

10:11.612 --> 10:16.158
On second thought, Neal, cream, no sugar.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.534
We have agents for that.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.953
I have something better. I have you.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.246
(SIGHS)

10:22.623 --> 10:23.790
Thank you.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.462
I didn't want to say this
in front of your criminal consultant,

10:28.545 --> 10:30.756
but I think Stanzler's
looking for a burglar.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.091
-What's he trying to steal?
-I'm not sure.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.677
But I listened in
on a very cryptic phone conversation

10:35.761 --> 10:37.429
he had with someone named Bill Roscoe.

10:37.513 --> 10:38.722
Bill Roscoe.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.933
I googled the name
and Bill has a criminal record for...

10:41.016 --> 10:42.559
Breaking and entering, yeah.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.397
Oof. Don't you hate it
when Peter makes you get coffee?

10:48.440 --> 10:51.068
You're getting me mocha chai lattes
for the rest of the month.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.738
Hey, boss. Why is Neal in your office?

10:54.821 --> 10:57.366
Neal is posing as Peter
so a witness will tell us

10:57.449 --> 10:58.784
about an energy collusion scam.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.869
-Awesome. I'm going in.
-No!

11:00.953 --> 11:02.663
Oh, come on. Let me bring him a file.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.957
-No, what do you have?
-Uh-uh. This is for Peter.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.416
-(CHUCKLES)
-Diana.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.710
(CHUCKLES) It's the info Sara requested
on Gerhard Wagner.

11:09.628 --> 11:12.297
There's nothing in here.
Why is Gerhard Wagner's file empty?

11:12.381 --> 11:14.967
The Department of Defense
classified his information

11:15.050 --> 11:17.219
when he emigrated to the US
after World War II.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.721
Yeah, but that was more than 50 years ago.

11:19.805 --> 11:23.392
I'll make some calls,
see if I can get his file declassified.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.936
All right, I'm gonna find out
what Brooke had to say to me.

11:27.271 --> 11:28.939
-This is gonna be good.
-Oh, yeah.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.191
-PETER: No, no. No.
-(LAUGHING)

11:32.860 --> 11:34.361
A thief?

11:34.444 --> 11:36.446
Sounds like a job for Neal Caffrey.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.198
Yeah. Too bad Stanzler's already made me.

11:38.282 --> 11:39.950
I would love to find out
what he was trying to steal.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.537
You still can.
Or the new Neal Caffrey can.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.955
(LAUGHING)

11:46.290 --> 11:49.126
You're serious?
Peter, that's bold thinking,

11:49.209 --> 11:51.295
but posing as a thief, particularly as me,

11:51.378 --> 11:54.965
I mean, you'd be better off sending in
any number of competent criminal CIs.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.885
Mmm-hmm.
No. I'm retaking control of this case

11:57.968 --> 11:59.386
before anything else goes sideways.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.512
Talk to Brooke.

12:00.596 --> 12:03.182
Have her put Neal Caffrey,
thief, on his books.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.558
-That's you?
-That's me.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.818
MOZZIE: Welding
is a lot harder than it looks.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.528
I deserve a medal. (CHUCKLES)

12:16.612 --> 12:19.406
Sorry about the flames.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.159
-You wanna wear my extra helmet?
-NEAL: I'm good.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.621
Nothing like wearing a leather flame suit
on the hottest day of the year.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.789
I'm almost back to my fighting weight.

12:28.957 --> 12:32.336
For the last parts for the antenna,
I've been scouring eBay Europe.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.171
Are you even listening to me?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.839
You wouldn't believe the amount
of paperwork required

12:35.923 --> 12:38.217
-to send someone undercover.
-Isn't that the suit's job?

12:38.300 --> 12:40.344
Yeah, he made me do it
since I told the whistleblower

12:40.427 --> 12:41.637
I was Peter Burke.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.514
(CHUCKLES) Why would you do that?

12:43.597 --> 12:45.307
We were gonna lose her. I had to.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.351
Now I'm stuck with the IS9 form,

12:47.434 --> 12:49.728
AKA the Whistleblower
Declaration of Facts.

12:49.811 --> 12:52.898
Okay. Remember when your mother
said don't cross your eyes

12:52.981 --> 12:54.775
-because they're gonna stay that way?
-Yeah.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.486
The same thing holds
for impersonating a suit.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.155
Get out
or I'm gonna find you wearing wingtips.

13:00.239 --> 13:03.909
-What do you think?
-Oh. I'm too late.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.495
The metamorphosis is complete, cockroach.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.789
-Thanks, Kafka.
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

13:11.416 --> 13:15.128
Peter, Sara, what are you doing here?

13:18.006 --> 13:20.759
-PETER: Do I wanna know?
-Not yet.

13:20.843 --> 13:25.264
All right.
Tales of the FBI's classified files.

13:25.347 --> 13:27.599
Peter figured out
why Adler's so interested in Wagner.

13:27.683 --> 13:31.436
Excellent. Top-secret movies.
I'll make popcorn.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.980
Butter, please.

13:37.109 --> 13:38.861
MOZZIE: When do we get to the good part?

13:38.944 --> 13:40.779
SARA AND NEAL: Shh.
PETER: Quiet.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.948
MAN: (ON TV) <i>...and their relentless</i>
<i>counter blockade</i>

13:43.031 --> 13:45.450
<i>to destroy Britain's shipping.</i>

13:45.534 --> 13:48.036
PETER: The man on the left
is Gerhard Wagner.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.582
He worked as a radio operator
in the U-boat headquarters.

13:51.665 --> 13:55.002
After the fall of the Third Reich,
he fled to America.

13:55.085 --> 13:59.840
He claimed to have top-secret information
he wanted to share with the US.

13:59.923 --> 14:04.344
Gerhard Wagner, however, was sent
to a detention center at Ellis Island.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.221
And whatever he knew disappeared with him

14:06.305 --> 14:08.348
when he escaped from the detention center
a few weeks later.

14:08.432 --> 14:11.768
What kind of top-secret information
could Wagner have

14:11.852 --> 14:14.980
that Adler would be looking for
a half-century later?

14:15.063 --> 14:17.900
I have a feeling it has something to do
with the antenna Mozzie's been building.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.776
Which makes sense
because he was a radio guy.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.237
If he escaped the detention center,

14:22.321 --> 14:25.991
he may have hopped the fence
and gotten in the naturalization line.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.702
Why not? Changed his name,
became an upstanding citizen.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.621
PETER: All right. We'll check the archives

14:30.704 --> 14:33.123
for matches between
his physical description

14:33.207 --> 14:36.043
and someone who entered Ellis Island
around that same time.

14:36.126 --> 14:39.922
Listen. Uh, next time you're poking
around classified files,

14:40.005 --> 14:43.175
see if you can find anything
on the death of the electric car.

14:43.258 --> 14:46.094
Sure. And I can throw in
some stuff about crop circles.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.262
(WHISPERING) Yes.

14:48.514 --> 14:50.390
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Oh, you're joking.

14:50.474 --> 14:52.059
PETER: Mozzie, the US government

14:52.142 --> 14:53.852
is not conducting
mind-control experiments.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.604
MOZZIE: That's what
they've made you believe.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.940
-Are we doing this again?
-Guess so.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.234
-Are you headed home?
-No. I'm gonna go grab a bite.

15:00.317 --> 15:02.194
-What about you?
-Uh, just to the gym.

15:02.277 --> 15:05.030
Really? I just...
I took you for more of a sit-up,

15:05.113 --> 15:06.573
pushup-in-the-morning kind of guy.

15:06.657 --> 15:07.658
-I swim.
-Yeah?

15:07.741 --> 15:09.034
How's that work with your ankle bracelet?

15:09.117 --> 15:11.370
It's waterproof.
Are you trained in counter-surveillance?

15:11.453 --> 15:14.456
Talking about the guy at our six o'clock?

15:14.540 --> 15:16.542
-So the answer's yes?
-Yes.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.210
And he knows we made him.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.254
How long do you want to stay here?

15:20.337 --> 15:21.922
See what his next move is.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.218
Much better.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.387
That's not fair. It's my game.

15:28.470 --> 15:29.596
We take turns.

15:30.472 --> 15:33.016
-He's making his next move.
-(TIRES SCREECH)

15:40.899 --> 15:42.484
-You okay?
-Yeah.

15:42.568 --> 15:45.529
Yeah, I've been followed before
in my line of work.

15:45.612 --> 15:49.157
Whoever he is,
he knows you're working for us.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.879
So the emergency exits are here and here.

16:01.962 --> 16:06.300
There's only one entrance
to the exhibit and a service corridor.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.678
If you're not planning
on robbing the museum,

16:09.761 --> 16:10.929
why would you need to know all this?

16:11.013 --> 16:12.806
It's my in to impress Stanzler.

16:12.890 --> 16:15.601
You know,
it's sexy watching you plan a heist.

16:15.684 --> 16:16.810
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

16:16.894 --> 16:18.604
-Think I should go rogue?
-Yes.

16:18.687 --> 16:19.813
(CHUCKLES)

16:20.689 --> 16:24.359
All right, say goodbye to Peter Burke.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.278
(BOTH CLEAR THROAT)

16:28.447 --> 16:31.366
Hi. I'm Caffrey, Neal Caffrey.

16:31.450 --> 16:32.701
(CHUCKLES)

16:32.784 --> 16:34.912
-What?
-Nothing.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.205
You don't like my Neal?

16:36.288 --> 16:38.957
Well, he sort of has a way of,

16:39.041 --> 16:41.418
I don't know,
pulling you in when he talks.

16:41.502 --> 16:43.754
A kind of quiet, sexy whisper.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.673
-Oh, sexy, huh?
-And he doesn't put his hands on his hips.

16:46.757 --> 16:47.758
Right.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.219
He gets people to do what he wants
by charming them.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.929
He doesn't rely on a badge.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.014
Really?

16:54.097 --> 16:57.351
Well, you are so smart.

16:58.769 --> 17:00.395
You have all the answers.

17:00.479 --> 17:03.524
And I couldn't do this without you.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.234
Much better.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.696
-(CHUCKLES) Oh, honey.
-Hmm.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.448
You're gonna have to take off
your wedding ring.

17:13.367 --> 17:14.660
I am.

17:18.747 --> 17:21.291
-Hmm.
-I feel naked without it.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.961
Hmm... Maybe you could wear a hat.

17:24.461 --> 17:25.462
(GROANS)

17:25.546 --> 17:26.839
(ELIZABETH CHUCKLES)

17:32.886 --> 17:34.304
BROOKE: Mr. Stanzler.

17:35.764 --> 17:36.849
This is Neal Caffrey.

17:36.932 --> 17:39.852
-Who?
-Your 11 o'clock, sir.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.942
I understand
you're interested in an acquisition.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.735
I'm sorry. What?

17:48.819 --> 17:51.864
You're interested in an acquisition?

17:51.947 --> 17:53.407
Who told you that?

17:54.116 --> 17:55.951
I think Bill Roscoe.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.954
-He said you offered him a job.
-Yeah.

17:59.037 --> 18:03.125
Well, (CHUCKLES) big Bill has a big mouth,
and I never offered him anything.

18:03.208 --> 18:07.171
Hmm. Well, if there is a job,
I'm your man.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.298
Yeah. (LAUGHING)

18:09.381 --> 18:11.258
Everybody in your business
says the same thing, right?

18:11.341 --> 18:12.384
(CHUCKLES)

18:12.467 --> 18:15.304
What if I told you I could rob this place
in under 20 minutes?

18:15.387 --> 18:18.515
I'd say good luck. We've got
the top-of-the-line security system.

18:18.599 --> 18:20.517
Well, it's good but nothing's perfect.

18:20.601 --> 18:23.812
Two cameras cover the front and back,
but they're blind to the side exits.

18:23.896 --> 18:28.233
Your roof? It's a burglar's dream.
One inch wood and asphalt.

18:28.317 --> 18:30.485
What exactly would you leave with?

18:30.569 --> 18:34.656
Every display is laser guarded,
heat-, motion-, and weight-sensored.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.366
I know.

18:36.450 --> 18:39.620
So I'd skip the display
and hit your private collection.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.371
How did you know about that?

18:41.455 --> 18:44.333
Like I said, I'm the best.

18:52.674 --> 18:56.345
Stanzler needs a thief
to steal a flash drive from this man,

18:56.428 --> 18:59.890
-another trader, Francis Luntz.
-Oh, slow down, Caffrey.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.642
I wanna hear details about the meet.

19:01.725 --> 19:02.976
Quiet, you.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.270
Based on their trading records

19:05.354 --> 19:07.564
and what little information
I got from Stanzler,

19:07.648 --> 19:10.984
I believe the two are using
their combined market power

19:11.068 --> 19:12.945
to create temporary shortages.

19:13.028 --> 19:15.030
But did you flaunt your past crimes?

19:15.113 --> 19:17.366
No, I did not flaunt my past crimes.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.451
How did you convince him to hire you?

19:19.535 --> 19:20.661
I'm that good.

19:20.744 --> 19:23.080
Now, these guys are incredibly careful.

19:23.163 --> 19:27.125
From what I can gather,
Luntz doesn't trust Stanzler.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.878
He secretly videotaped
one of their meetings.

19:29.962 --> 19:32.214
Now, this video,
which is now on flash drive,

19:32.297 --> 19:34.466
is what Stanzler wants me to retrieve.

19:34.550 --> 19:35.801
-Steal.
-Steal.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.387
-Why don't we just use a warrant?
-We could.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.848
But Stanzler doesn't know
exactly what's on the tape.

19:40.931 --> 19:44.142
So if we shake Luntz down
and the video is insufficient,

19:44.226 --> 19:46.895
we blow our chances
of catching either one of these guys.

19:46.979 --> 19:49.189
But I do want a warrant for Luntz's home.

19:49.273 --> 19:51.733
-I don't need a warrant to break in.
-Well, this Neal Caffrey does.

19:52.776 --> 19:53.777
That's it for now.

20:03.829 --> 20:07.165
After we left my apartment last night,
Sara and I were followed.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.333
Any suspects?

20:08.417 --> 20:10.752
Adler. I think he put a tail on Sara.

20:10.836 --> 20:13.630
Everyone who's looked into him,
Mozzie, Kate, they all got hurt.

20:13.714 --> 20:16.341
-Where's she now?
-At the archives. I'm meeting her there.

20:16.425 --> 20:18.677
-Good idea. Stay close to her.
-All right.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.263
All right, but for my break-in,
I'm gonna need some training.

20:22.806 --> 20:23.807
I got you covered.

20:32.566 --> 20:34.902
Ah. My pupil has arrived.

20:38.322 --> 20:39.907
Take the pebble from my palm.

20:41.867 --> 20:43.452
Seriously? Kung fu?

20:43.535 --> 20:45.078
I'm preparing you for your mission.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.624
Okay. Give me $20.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.418
Look, do you want my help or not?

20:57.007 --> 21:00.719
Lesson one. We take, we don't give.

21:00.802 --> 21:02.262
Now, moving on...

21:02.346 --> 21:04.056
Give me my 20 back
or I'm gonna arrest you.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.683
Oh, you're gonna be
a very difficult student.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.229
-Hey.
-Hi.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.022
-Did anyone follow you?
-No. You?

21:12.105 --> 21:13.190
No. All clear.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.234
They said on the phone
that it could take up to four weeks

21:15.317 --> 21:19.196
-for us to get access to those files.
-That's all right. I got a plan.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.406
Are you gonna share that plan with me?

21:24.284 --> 21:27.663
Any chance you can tell me a little more
about what you're looking for?

21:27.746 --> 21:29.623
Only that it's regarding an individual

21:29.706 --> 21:32.334
who may have come through
Ellis Island in 1946.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.753
We need to look through the files
to match a physical description.

21:34.837 --> 21:36.839
-The rest is national security.
-You understand.

21:36.922 --> 21:40.259
Of course. Sorry I wasn't
more helpful over the phone.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.094
She didn't say she was with the FBI.

21:42.177 --> 21:43.595
Oh, she's not.

21:44.763 --> 21:46.265
I am.

21:46.348 --> 21:48.350
Please follow me.

21:50.060 --> 21:52.646
Peter knows... the broad strokes.

21:53.772 --> 21:55.399
(CHUCKLES)

21:58.652 --> 21:59.945
This is it.

22:01.363 --> 22:04.908
Records, ledgers, card catalogs.

22:04.992 --> 22:07.786
-Which ones are from 1946?
-All of them.

22:07.870 --> 22:09.121
Excuse me.

22:12.416 --> 22:15.586
Huh. Yeah. We can do this.

22:16.503 --> 22:20.132
Okay, listen up, sausage fingers.
We don't have all day.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.594
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-Oh. Our guest speaker.

22:25.179 --> 22:26.305
Hello there.

22:26.388 --> 22:27.848
How's he doing?

22:27.931 --> 22:29.808
Uh, we'll come back
to the lock-picking later.

22:29.892 --> 22:34.313
Byron would be so thrilled
to know his training jacket

22:34.396 --> 22:36.690
-is back in the game.
-(CHUCKLES)

22:36.773 --> 22:38.483
Are you teaching him to run a cross?

22:38.567 --> 22:39.735
Oh. Scratch on a dip.

22:39.818 --> 22:41.445
With the farmer's pants?

22:41.528 --> 22:43.822
-Neal wants to run a bird dog.
-Oh.

22:43.906 --> 22:44.948
He's a fed.

22:45.741 --> 22:49.244
-Can we move on with this?
-Uh, yes.

22:49.328 --> 22:53.749
Now, your first task
is to drop a bug into Stanzler's jacket

22:53.832 --> 22:57.628
so your little evil empire friends
in the van can listen in on him

22:57.711 --> 22:59.505
while you fumble through the house.

22:59.588 --> 23:01.340
-Do we need a commentary?
-Yes.

23:01.423 --> 23:04.426
But dropping the bug isn't the hard part.

23:04.510 --> 23:07.846
Retrieving it is
without jingling the bells.

23:14.561 --> 23:15.562
(BELLS JINGLE)

23:15.646 --> 23:16.897
-Aw.
-Again.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.484
PETER: All right.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.320
(JINGLING)

23:23.403 --> 23:25.030
(SIGHS) This is impossible.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.208
Understatement is the key.

23:36.291 --> 23:40.003
These two fingers like tweezers

23:40.087 --> 23:43.173
so that the thumb
will never touch the mark.

23:59.815 --> 24:00.858
(SIGHS)

24:00.941 --> 24:02.734
It's gonna take a while.

24:09.032 --> 24:12.911
So tell me, Repo, why you helping out?

24:12.995 --> 24:14.788
What's your angle in all this?

24:15.831 --> 24:18.250
If Adler spent his life
searching for something

24:18.333 --> 24:21.795
that means the payoff's gotta be bigger
than the billion he's already stolen.

24:21.879 --> 24:22.921
That's all?

24:24.923 --> 24:26.717
I like the mystery.

24:29.678 --> 24:32.264
I know what it's like
to have a lot of questions.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.850
Really?

24:36.476 --> 24:40.272
When I was 13, my older sister ran away
and we never heard from her again.

24:42.900 --> 24:43.901
Sorry.

24:45.277 --> 24:48.322
I used to go into her room
and just look at her things

24:48.405 --> 24:50.782
and hope that something held the key.

24:50.866 --> 24:53.827
You know, if there was a book
about dancers,

24:53.911 --> 24:56.038
I'd wonder, is she a ballerina?

24:57.206 --> 25:01.460
Or there was a pony poster,

25:01.543 --> 25:04.922
so I wondered
if she was off on a ranch somewhere.

25:05.005 --> 25:08.175
And I never found the answers
I was looking for.

25:10.427 --> 25:12.346
But...

25:12.429 --> 25:15.849
if we find Adler, maybe you can
have some closure with Kate.

25:29.321 --> 25:30.822
MOZZIE: Last chance, suit.

25:30.906 --> 25:33.158
Some of us go to work at night.

25:44.086 --> 25:45.420
Like this?

25:51.343 --> 25:52.886
(BELLS JINGLING)

25:52.970 --> 25:54.930
-You didn't drop a bug.
-No, I didn't.

25:55.013 --> 25:57.891
I decided to practice one more lift.

26:02.104 --> 26:03.480
(JUNE CHUCKLES)

26:03.564 --> 26:05.607
You've learned all I have to teach you.

26:05.691 --> 26:08.902
You, Peter Burke,
are ready to commit a crime.

26:16.201 --> 26:17.870
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

26:19.037 --> 26:20.873
-NEAL: Looking sharp, Peter.
-Thank you.

26:20.956 --> 26:23.458
There's a very good teacher
inside that little shiny head of his.

26:24.376 --> 26:25.878
-How'd it go at the archives?
-Great.

26:25.961 --> 26:27.504
But it's gonna take a while
to find Wagner.

26:27.588 --> 26:29.173
Another late night with Sara, huh?

26:29.256 --> 26:31.258
Hey, keep your eye on the prize, okay?
This is serious.

26:31.341 --> 26:32.843
Stanzler doesn't mess around.

26:32.926 --> 26:34.636
And remember,
backup is ten seconds away...

26:34.720 --> 26:37.431
You don't give me the "be careful" speech.
I invented the "be careful" speech.

26:37.514 --> 26:39.099
Yeah. But since I'm you...

26:39.183 --> 26:41.727
You're Neal in the van,
and I'm Neal outside the van.

26:41.810 --> 26:45.439
Okay. Now go out there
and make me look good.

26:53.822 --> 26:56.366
-Neal.
-Mr. Stanzler.

26:56.450 --> 27:00.287
When you get to the master bedroom,
look for anything called Project Edison.

27:00.370 --> 27:01.371
Got it.

27:01.455 --> 27:03.081
My meeting with Luntz
will last 20 minutes.

27:03.165 --> 27:04.917
You have exactly that to find the video

27:05.000 --> 27:06.919
(OVER SPEAKERS)
<i>and find your way back to the Bentley.</i>

27:07.002 --> 27:08.378
PETER: <i>Twenty minutes? Plenty of time.</i>

27:08.462 --> 27:10.339
STANZLER: <i>It better be,</i>
<i>otherwise you're on your own.</i>

27:10.422 --> 27:11.715
Let's go.

27:22.142 --> 27:23.977
PETER: <i>Heads up, guys.</i>

27:24.061 --> 27:26.438
<i>I think we're pulling into</i>
<i>Luntz's mansion.</i>

27:54.758 --> 27:57.928
Out of the vehicle,
headed to the basement door.

27:58.011 --> 27:59.847
Good. We got ears on you.

27:59.930 --> 28:01.640
Wait for me to confirm that.

28:04.101 --> 28:06.478
-PETER: <i>Working on the lock now.</i>
-Okay.

28:06.562 --> 28:08.063
We have ears on you.

28:13.944 --> 28:15.195
I'm in.

28:25.163 --> 28:27.875
LUNTZ: So, tell me
about this guy Wheelock.

28:27.958 --> 28:30.752
He contacted the power company.
What else did he say?

28:30.836 --> 28:32.880
STANZLER: They have budget cuts,
fewer controls,

28:32.963 --> 28:35.841
which makes monitoring us
that much more difficult.

28:44.808 --> 28:46.476
SARA: Three thousand immigrants a week

28:46.560 --> 28:48.228
and not one of these files
is computerized.

28:48.312 --> 28:52.774
Well, whoever this Gerhard Wagner is,
he has earned my admiration.

28:52.858 --> 28:53.859
How is that?

28:53.942 --> 28:56.361
Well, he worked the system
to his advantage.

28:56.445 --> 28:59.489
I mean, one day he was here,
and the next, poof!

28:59.573 --> 29:02.367
He's vanished into the vast bureaucracy.

29:02.451 --> 29:04.453
Like a German Dave Chappelle.

29:05.829 --> 29:08.123
Did Neal send you to come sit with me?

29:09.291 --> 29:12.711
Uh, no one sends me. I go places.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.588
Of course. My mistake.

29:16.381 --> 29:19.134
He's not worried about you,
if that's what you're implying.

29:19.218 --> 29:20.802
I'm here for obvious reasons.

29:20.886 --> 29:22.596
Well, of course.

29:22.679 --> 29:25.766
I mean, it's impossible to deny
this Tracy-Hepburn thing between us.

29:25.849 --> 29:27.142
I do want you, Mozzie.

29:27.226 --> 29:28.894
Please control yourself.

29:29.603 --> 29:32.523

-I want to get Adler, too.

-(ELECTRICITY HUMMING)
-I'll let you know.

29:52.709 --> 29:54.086
I'm in the master bedroom.

29:54.169 --> 29:55.796
All right, check the drawers and cabinets.

29:55.879 --> 29:58.006
People usually hide things
where they're easily accessible.

29:59.216 --> 30:00.759
As Mozzie taught you.

30:20.237 --> 30:22.698
I found a safe key. Centurion.

30:22.781 --> 30:25.242
Centurion. Look for an in-wall safe.

30:35.419 --> 30:39.173
Mrs. Luntz. Well done, Mr. Luntz.

30:45.971 --> 30:47.556
I found the safe.

30:55.022 --> 30:57.274
I found the video.

30:57.357 --> 30:58.859
I'm copying it now.

30:58.942 --> 31:01.737
I'll give the original to Stanzler
and keep the backup for us.

31:01.820 --> 31:02.946
Guys, listen to this.

LUNTZ: <i>This Chip Wheelock, the guy at ECH.</i>

31:05.032 --> 31:06.575
That's East Coast Hydroelectric.

31:06.658 --> 31:08.118
What exactly does he know?

31:08.202 --> 31:10.537
He knows he wants in.

31:10.621 --> 31:12.706
We got a guy in the power company

31:12.789 --> 31:16.668
flips a switch, rolling blackouts,
we make a fortune.

31:16.752 --> 31:19.671
No. No way. It's too risky.

31:19.755 --> 31:21.507
You mean it's too easy?

31:21.590 --> 31:24.092
Look, go to the party on Saturday night,

31:24.176 --> 31:27.262
talk to the guy, spend a few minutes,
see what he has to say.

31:27.346 --> 31:29.223
<i>If you don't like it,</i><i>take a walk.</i>

31:29.306 --> 31:31.683
Peter, Stanzler and Luntz
may have an executive

31:31.767 --> 31:33.477
from East Coast Hydroelectric
in their pocket.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.145
He's meeting them at the party
on Saturday.

31:35.979 --> 31:40.192
All right. We wait until Saturday
and take down all three of them.

31:40.275 --> 31:41.276
(BEEPING)

31:42.236 --> 31:43.862
The video's copied.

31:48.909 --> 31:51.036
I'm on my way out.

31:51.119 --> 31:52.371
What's your exit plan?

31:52.454 --> 31:55.082
Same as my entrance plan.

31:57.167 --> 31:59.211
Did you get it?

31:59.294 --> 32:00.504
Yeah.

32:01.839 --> 32:03.423
Very good.

32:03.507 --> 32:05.259
Give me a hand.

32:12.683 --> 32:13.851
It's been a pleasure.

32:13.934 --> 32:15.894
You want another job?

32:15.978 --> 32:19.189
-What do you have in mind?
-Geller Museum, Saturday at 5:00.

32:19.273 --> 32:21.650
Tell no one, ask no questions,
and I'll pay you double.

32:21.733 --> 32:24.236
-Okay.
-Okay.

32:32.953 --> 32:36.623
STANZLER: <i>After the first outage,</i>
<i>we will clear seven figures a month.</i>

32:37.708 --> 32:39.209
This is what was on the drive.

32:39.293 --> 32:41.879
Luntz recorded this meeting
and kept his mouth shut

32:41.962 --> 32:44.089
even though, we believe,
he went on to participate.

32:44.173 --> 32:48.552
Saturday, Stanzler's trying
to bring in this man to sweeten the pot.

32:48.635 --> 32:51.763
Chip Wheelock, senior manager
at East Coast Hydroelectric.

32:51.847 --> 32:55.058
With someone at the power plant
able to flip the switch,

32:55.142 --> 32:57.144
they'll be able to escalate their plan.

32:57.227 --> 32:59.938
-That means more blackouts.
-Not if we stop them.

33:00.022 --> 33:02.399
I've been invited to an event as Neal.

33:02.482 --> 33:04.860
So we can take advantage
of this opportunity

33:04.943 --> 33:07.070
by slipping a video feed on Stanzler.

33:07.154 --> 33:08.864
-How are we gonna do that?
-DIANA: Brooke was able to get

33:08.947 --> 33:10.824
Stanzler's suit from the dry cleaner.

33:10.908 --> 33:13.493
We installed a camera
in place of the lapel button.

33:13.577 --> 33:14.995
Check this out.

33:20.501 --> 33:21.502
Nice.

33:21.585 --> 33:25.631
Brooke will make sure
that Stanzler's wearing that jacket.

33:25.714 --> 33:28.050
Jones, Diana, you'll be in the van.

33:28.133 --> 33:29.384
Always.

33:29.468 --> 33:30.761
I like the van.

33:30.844 --> 33:33.263
And as a precaution,
I'll be accompanying Elizabeth.

33:33.347 --> 33:35.724
-As my wife's husband.
-Yeah.

33:35.807 --> 33:37.017
(LAUGHS)

33:44.066 --> 33:46.527
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

33:48.320 --> 33:51.156
Tell your staff they get a hundred each
if they don't spill anything.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.491
They get fired if they do.

33:52.574 --> 33:54.743
El said you knew
how to motivate your employees.

33:54.826 --> 33:57.287
It's the smallest eight-foot bear
I've ever seen in my life.

33:57.371 --> 33:59.122
I've got Stanzler's camera online.

33:59.206 --> 34:01.583
Anything Stanzler sees, we'll see.

34:02.459 --> 34:04.419
Neal, have you met
Peter and Elizabeth Burke?

34:04.503 --> 34:06.505
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

34:06.588 --> 34:08.423
-This is my lovely wife Elizabeth.
-Hi.

34:08.507 --> 34:10.843
-You married up.
-You're telling me.

34:10.926 --> 34:13.428
-I could use a drink right now.
-Yes. I'll have one, too.

34:13.512 --> 34:15.764
Yeah. Me, too. Thank you.

34:16.723 --> 34:18.934

STANZLER: Can you
help me out here for a second?

34:24.773 --> 34:26.316
Yeah, you're the boss.

34:31.321 --> 34:32.990
STANZLER: Ladies, having fun?

34:34.741 --> 34:36.785
So this is undercover work, huh?

34:36.869 --> 34:39.329
I'm sure Peter
is hating every second of it.

34:39.413 --> 34:42.666
And you?
How does it feel to be an FBI agent?

34:42.749 --> 34:44.459
I'm still trying it on.

34:44.543 --> 34:47.129
The job certainly has its perks.

34:47.212 --> 34:48.839
Excuse us, ladies.

34:48.922 --> 34:51.008
-What are we doing?
-Your assignment.

34:51.967 --> 34:54.553
PETER: Everyone hear that? Showtime.

34:54.636 --> 34:55.971
Copy that, Peter.

35:04.855 --> 35:07.816
-You donated all of this?
-Yeah.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.652
I'd like you to babysit
my friend Francis there.

35:10.736 --> 35:12.362
He's not having a very good day.

35:12.446 --> 35:14.698
That's my assignment? Babysit Luntz?

35:14.781 --> 35:15.824
Yeah.

35:15.908 --> 35:18.243
I'll have more for you when I get back.

35:33.383 --> 35:35.344
-Lot on your mind?
-Yeah.

35:35.427 --> 35:39.598
Listen, I'm glad that, uh, Stanzler
let us alone for a couple of minutes.

35:39.681 --> 35:42.559
I don't know what he told you,
but I'm not interested.

35:42.643 --> 35:46.104
I mean, this thing, it's gotten
way beyond what I ever imagined.

35:46.188 --> 35:49.316
You two, you do what you want.
But I'm out.

35:50.484 --> 35:51.818
Sorry, Wheelock.

35:51.902 --> 35:54.154
Yeah, wait. Francis.

35:55.405 --> 35:58.367
-He told you I was Chip Wheelock?
-Yeah.

35:58.450 --> 35:59.785
But you're not?

36:00.661 --> 36:01.745
Excuse me a minute.

36:02.788 --> 36:05.082
I know about your energy scheme
with Stanzler.

36:05.165 --> 36:07.876
-What?
-He's planning to double-cross you.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.711
He can't do that.
I have leverage over him.

36:09.795 --> 36:10.838
-(DOOR RATTLES)
-(GRUNTS)

36:11.588 --> 36:13.423
Actually, you don't.

36:13.507 --> 36:16.468
Stanzler had me break into your estate
and steal the video.

36:16.552 --> 36:17.886
Who the hell are you?

36:17.970 --> 36:20.305
Jones, we're locked
in the Stanzler Gallery.

36:20.389 --> 36:21.932
On it.

36:22.015 --> 36:23.809
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

36:24.726 --> 36:26.979
Yeah, this is Jones. You sure?

36:27.980 --> 36:30.482
<i>Guys, another blackout's</i>
<i>about to</i><i>sweep through this sector.</i>

36:30.566 --> 36:31.733
Diana, find Elizabeth.

36:31.817 --> 36:32.985
-DIANA: Elizabeth?
-Yeah?

36:33.068 --> 36:35.320
-Backup generator?
-Downstairs.

36:35.404 --> 36:37.155
-Let's get down there.
-Okay.

36:38.323 --> 36:40.492
-Where's the team?
-JONES: <i>On their way in.</i>

36:40.576 --> 36:43.495
-Who are you talking to?
-The FBI.

36:43.579 --> 36:45.581
Of course. Perfect.

36:45.664 --> 36:49.376
Stanzler told you that Wheelock
would be here to lure you out.

36:49.459 --> 36:50.460
Why?

36:50.544 --> 36:52.963
My guess, when the power goes out

36:53.046 --> 36:58.010
he can circumvent the security cameras
and come back here unnoticed.

36:58.093 --> 36:59.511
What's the point?

37:00.387 --> 37:01.805
(SIGHS)

37:03.098 --> 37:05.934
Ah, Jesus. He's gonna kill me.

37:06.018 --> 37:10.022
If I'm right,
he's gonna try to kill us both.

37:11.023 --> 37:12.649
Who's got eyes on Stanzler?

37:12.733 --> 37:15.819
All right, I see him.
He's on the far side of the room.

37:15.903 --> 37:17.237
I'm on him.

37:19.323 --> 37:21.074
(ELECTRICITY POWERING DOWN)

37:21.158 --> 37:22.409
(ALARM RINGING)

37:23.285 --> 37:24.912
MAN: (ON PA) <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

37:24.995 --> 37:27.206
<i>due to the blackout,</i>
<i>this museum is now on lockdown.</i>

37:27.289 --> 37:31.502
FBI! Everyone stay where you are
and remain calm.

37:34.671 --> 37:35.839
Excuse me.

37:40.302 --> 37:41.595
Oh, come on.

37:42.179 --> 37:43.722
Can you open this?

37:45.098 --> 37:47.392
Peter, Stanzler's making his move.

37:47.476 --> 37:50.020
He's out of the atrium,
but I can't tell his location.

37:50.103 --> 37:52.314
Peter's in the Stanzler Gallery.
We need to get a key.

37:52.397 --> 37:53.482
AGENT 1: Let's go!
AGENT 2: Yes, sir!

37:53.565 --> 37:55.692
-Hurry up.
-Hold this.

37:55.776 --> 37:58.320
I wasn't trained to do this in the dark.

38:01.698 --> 38:05.369
Peter, there's another light in that room.
It's Stanzler. He's got a gun.

38:31.019 --> 38:33.188
DIANA: <i>We're at the generator.</i>
<i>It's been disengaged.</i>

38:33.272 --> 38:34.314
Can you turn it on?

38:39.862 --> 38:41.071
(GUNSHOT)

38:47.703 --> 38:50.122
NEAL: FBI. Drop it!
You're surrounded, Stanzler.

38:54.793 --> 38:57.713
Like he said. FBI has you surrounded.

39:09.349 --> 39:11.393
I didn't know you had moves like that.

39:11.476 --> 39:13.228
I didn't know I authorized a badge.

39:13.312 --> 39:14.354
Well, I needed one.

39:14.438 --> 39:16.523
-I was an FBI agent.
-Was.

39:16.607 --> 39:17.774
Was.

39:21.528 --> 39:22.988
You enjoyed being me.

39:23.655 --> 39:27.242
Yeah, I admit there's a certain allure
to your profession. How about you?

39:28.202 --> 39:29.912
Being Neal Caffrey has its charms.

39:29.995 --> 39:32.956
-Ignoring convention, embracing your id...
-Yeah.

39:33.040 --> 39:35.000
-And I do look good in black.
-You do.

39:35.083 --> 39:37.794
PETER: I have a feeling
I had to work a lot harder

39:37.878 --> 39:40.339
fitting into your world
than you did fitting into mine.

39:40.422 --> 39:41.673
I don't know about that.

39:41.757 --> 39:43.383
(CHUCKLES) Good work.

39:50.724 --> 39:52.726
-Hey.
-Hi.

39:52.809 --> 39:54.394
You got the generator back on.

39:54.478 --> 39:56.772
Well, I couldn't leave you in the dark.

39:56.855 --> 39:59.149
-Oh.
-Welcome home, Agent Burke.

39:59.233 --> 40:01.193
It's good to be home, Mrs. Burke.

40:19.419 --> 40:21.255
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

40:21.338 --> 40:24.258
Thank you. I was starving.

40:24.341 --> 40:26.969
Mozzie's in the other room
looking at microfiche.

40:27.052 --> 40:30.180
-How was your night?
-Oh, you know. The usual.

40:30.264 --> 40:31.974
-Yeah? What'd you get me?
-Yeah.

40:32.057 --> 40:35.143
-Oh, I love gourmet finger food.
-(CHUCKLES)

40:35.227 --> 40:36.562
It's a...

40:37.813 --> 40:40.232
Guess the blackout
finally caught up with this grid.

40:46.530 --> 40:49.116
Mozzie... Mozzie gave me a lantern.
I'm sorry.

40:49.199 --> 40:50.242
It's all right.

41:09.011 --> 41:10.137
(SARA CHUCKLES)

41:11.763 --> 41:12.890

41:12.973 --> 41:14.433
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

41:14.516 --> 41:16.602
(PANTING)

41:24.484 --> 41:26.320
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be sorry.

41:29.448 --> 41:31.700
-Uh, Sara? I got some...
-Huh?

41:31.783 --> 41:34.578
Uh... Hi, Neal.

41:34.661 --> 41:36.205
What do you got?

41:36.288 --> 41:40.501
Oh, the, um, urgency transcends
the awkwardness.

41:41.543 --> 41:44.630
I found Gerhard Wagner.

41:44.713 --> 41:46.548
Every characteristic matches.

41:46.632 --> 41:49.426
Height, eye color, facial structure.

41:49.510 --> 41:51.178
Uh, you missed a button.

41:52.137 --> 41:54.932
He registered with immigration
under the name Michael Hunter.

41:55.015 --> 41:57.142
-Well, let's go find him.
-Oh, we can't.

41:57.226 --> 41:59.228
Um, he died here in New York.

41:59.311 --> 42:02.940
The obit says
he has one surviving family member.

42:04.525 --> 42:05.567
A granddaughter.

42:09.488 --> 42:10.697
Alex Hunter.

42:11.949 --> 42:13.158
Who's Alex Hunter?

42:14.743 --> 42:16.036
I thought I knew.

42:17.412 --> 42:18.747
This is Alex.

42:20.123 --> 42:21.959
I'm heading to the location now.

42:23.877 --> 42:25.295
I'm on my way.
