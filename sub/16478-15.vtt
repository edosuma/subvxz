No, I'm good.
You okay?

01:20.094 --> 01:21.994
Yeah, I'm an NCIS agent now.
This is, you know...

01:21.996 --> 01:23.229
this is a piece of cake.

01:23.231 --> 01:24.764
Let's set it down.

01:24.766 --> 01:26.265
Yeah, that's a great idea.

01:27.335 --> 01:28.901
Just out of curiosity...
Huh?

01:28.903 --> 01:30.264
how'd you make it

01:30.265 --> 01:30.829
That's...

01:30.853 --> 01:32.853
Got through from
studying and effort,

01:32.974 --> 01:34.874
both of which you could
use a little more of.

01:34.876 --> 01:36.575
I'm just trying to help, Mom.

01:36.577 --> 01:39.612
Only 'cause you want
Danny's room now that he's gone.

01:39.614 --> 01:42.014
Back to studying,
Math test tomorrow.

01:42.016 --> 01:43.349
Go.

01:43.351 --> 01:46.185
See you, newbie.

01:46.187 --> 01:48.254
I can't believe how fast
he's growing up, you know?

01:48.256 --> 01:51.590
I can't believe how fast
all my boys are growing up.

01:51.592 --> 01:55.494
Danny joining the Navy,
you at NCIS...

01:55.496 --> 01:57.830
Oh, thanks, Doc, you know
I feel the same about you.

01:57.832 --> 01:59.365
You're like the mother
that I never had.

01:59.367 --> 02:00.666
You have a mother, Sebastian.

02:00.668 --> 02:01.934
I've met her.

02:01.936 --> 02:03.903
Exactly.

02:03.905 --> 02:05.871
So, what, this gonna be
the Wade cave now?

02:05.873 --> 02:07.873
Hmm? 60-inch plasma maybe?

02:07.875 --> 02:09.208
Poker table,
a couple lava lamps?

02:09.210 --> 02:11.243
I was thinking art studio,
actually.

02:11.245 --> 02:14.346
I used to paint all the time
before I got married.

02:14.348 --> 02:15.781
Wait, wait, hold on.

02:15.783 --> 02:17.183
I never knew
you were married.

02:17.185 --> 02:20.920
Yes, I was.
A long time ago, different life.

02:20.922 --> 02:23.789
Have a look for yourself.

02:25.927 --> 02:27.526
Is this him?

02:27.528 --> 02:28.594
Reginald.

02:28.596 --> 02:30.096
Easy on the eye, isn't he?

02:30.098 --> 02:31.831
Yeah, look how beautiful
you were.

02:33.201 --> 02:35.568
That's... um, not that
you're not beautiful now.

02:35.570 --> 02:37.937
Obviously, you're... you're
very beautiful, it's just...

02:37.939 --> 02:38.904
you know, when you...

02:38.906 --> 02:40.840
It's all right, Sebastian.

02:40.842 --> 02:44.510
Reginald was a good man
when we first met.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.779
We had some good years
together...

02:46.781 --> 02:48.180
until we didn't.

02:50.151 --> 02:51.550
What happened?

02:51.552 --> 02:53.819
Let's just say he changed...

02:53.821 --> 02:56.122
not for the better.

03:00.728 --> 03:02.128
Duty calls.

03:02.130 --> 03:03.762
Looks like I've got a body.

03:03.764 --> 03:05.831
Yeah, NCIS.
It's probably the same body.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.199
You want to share a ride?

03:07.201 --> 03:09.969
Only if you don't ask
any more questions.

03:15.443 --> 03:17.810
These guys'll
take care of you.

03:17.812 --> 03:20.513
You'll be all right.

03:20.515 --> 03:21.814
She the first on scene?

03:21.816 --> 03:24.617
Streetcar driver, just
showing up for work.

03:24.619 --> 03:25.885
Not the best way
to start a day.

03:25.887 --> 03:27.286
About as grisly as it gets.

03:27.288 --> 03:28.354
Any witnesses?

03:28.356 --> 03:29.989
Not according to NOPD,

03:29.991 --> 03:31.924
but hopefully we got something
from these security cameras.

03:31.926 --> 03:32.958
Well, I doubt it.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.026
Killer placed the body

03:34.028 --> 03:36.328
directly behind
these streetcars,

03:36.330 --> 03:37.696
blocking all the cameras.

03:37.698 --> 03:39.265
I doubt the killer was
trying to avoid cameras.

03:39.267 --> 03:41.433
It's too specific
of a location.

03:41.435 --> 03:44.503
Profiler in me seems
to think that whoever it was

03:44.505 --> 03:45.538
was trying
to make a statement.

03:47.975 --> 03:50.509
Take it you don't want to ask
her out again, am I right?

03:50.511 --> 03:52.711
Blind date, high risk.

03:52.713 --> 03:54.747
I told you,
they're not worth dinner.

03:54.749 --> 03:56.815
Just drinks, and you definitely
don't give your number

03:56.817 --> 03:58.484
until you're sure
you like her.

03:58.486 --> 04:00.152
Is that you profiling,
Gregorio?

04:00.154 --> 04:01.620
That's me dating, amateur.

04:01.622 --> 04:03.689
Mm, I've dated plenty.
I'm not an amateur.

04:03.691 --> 04:04.890
Maybe a couple of hookups,

04:04.892 --> 04:06.325
but not potential
relationships.

04:06.327 --> 04:07.893
It's a whole different deal,

04:07.895 --> 04:10.796
and this whole airbrushed-photo
thing on dating apps...

04:10.798 --> 04:13.699
I mean, the only way to trigger
the yay or nay hormones

04:13.701 --> 04:16.168
is to have good,
old-fashioned eye contact.

04:16.170 --> 04:18.971
I never knew you
as a romantic, Gregorio.

04:18.973 --> 04:21.373
Profiling's not just
for finding criminals.

04:21.375 --> 04:23.342
Comes in handy, trust me.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.847
All I know so far is the
victim's Chief Karen Decker,

04:28.849 --> 04:30.583
based out of Belle Chasse.

04:30.585 --> 04:32.117
Still waiting on Loretta,

04:32.119 --> 04:33.619
so we can't take
the body down yet.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.020
Not a lot of blood
on the ground,

04:35.022 --> 04:36.322
considering all the stab wounds,

04:36.324 --> 04:38.157
which means she was killed
somewhere else,

04:38.159 --> 04:39.391
and then moved here.

04:39.393 --> 04:40.593
The question is, why here?

04:40.595 --> 04:42.027
Big risk...

04:42.029 --> 04:44.330
taking the time and effort
to string her up,

04:44.332 --> 04:46.031
not to mention the mutilation.

04:46.033 --> 04:47.733
Talking ritualistic?

04:47.735 --> 04:51.070
Crucifix pose indicates
she was meant to be a sacrifice.

04:51.072 --> 04:53.739
Eyes dug out so she couldn't
see her killer's soul.

04:53.741 --> 04:55.374
Okay, so, we figure out

04:55.376 --> 04:56.976
what she was sacrificed for,

04:56.978 --> 04:59.678
we might be able to ID
the lunatic who did this to her.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.413
My God.

05:03.951 --> 05:05.150
Loretta.

05:10.258 --> 05:11.523
Loretta, you all right?

05:11.525 --> 05:14.059
Please, get her down.

05:15.162 --> 05:16.662
Let's go find a ladder.

05:20.134 --> 05:22.201
Look, Gregorio,

05:22.203 --> 05:24.703
I'll check with Decker's C.O.,
all right?

05:24.705 --> 05:26.639
You take Christopher
and get with Patton,

05:26.641 --> 05:29.742
find out as much about her
as you can as fast as you can.

05:29.744 --> 05:31.477
Copy that.

05:31.479 --> 05:33.145
Tough to look at,
isn't it?

05:33.147 --> 05:36.115
I saw something like this
once before.

05:38.085 --> 05:40.919
I'd hoped never to see it again.

05:45.426 --> 05:49.662
Man, hard to believe anybody
would want to do her harm,

05:49.664 --> 05:51.297
especially that kind of harm.

05:51.299 --> 05:53.465
20-year vet,
unblemished record,

05:53.467 --> 05:55.601
Navy counselor who
helps other sailors.

05:55.603 --> 05:57.269
Yeah, a couple of
months from retiring,

05:57.271 --> 05:58.470
according to her record.

05:58.472 --> 06:00.072
About to start a new life.

06:00.074 --> 06:03.042
Only to have it stolen away
by some monster. Why?

06:03.044 --> 06:07.179
C.O. says Chief Decker got an
urgent call yesterday at noon,

06:07.181 --> 06:09.281
rushed out, never came back.

06:09.283 --> 06:10.449
Check her phone log?

06:10.451 --> 06:13.352
Putting it up
on the screen.

06:13.354 --> 06:15.954
Looks like the only incoming
call she got yesterday.

06:15.956 --> 06:18.924
But from the same caller
who called several days before.

06:18.926 --> 06:20.292
Can you trace that joker?

06:20.294 --> 06:21.760
Can't, burner cell.

06:21.762 --> 06:24.263
Powered down, too.
Or, more likely, destroyed.

06:24.265 --> 06:26.765
Well, any chance you can find
out where the call originated?

06:26.767 --> 06:28.767
Read my mind, bossman.

06:28.769 --> 06:31.370
There, pinged
from a cell tower

06:31.372 --> 06:33.605
across from the old
Peters Junior High School.

06:33.607 --> 06:35.140
Now, Peters has been
abandoned since Katrina,

06:35.142 --> 06:36.642
and who would want
to be hanging there?

06:36.644 --> 06:37.710
Obviously,
somebody who doesn't

06:37.712 --> 06:39.411
want to be found. Shall we?

06:39.413 --> 06:43.315
Keep me posted.
I'm gonna go to the morgue.

06:43.317 --> 06:45.851
See what Loretta knows.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:10.311 --> 07:10.883
Bad news.

07:10.907 --> 07:12.907
Damn it, Sebastian!
Don't sneak upon me like that.

07:13.080 --> 07:14.747
Whoa, whoa,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

07:16.384 --> 07:19.418
Are-Are you okay?

07:20.254 --> 07:22.755
Yeah.

07:22.757 --> 07:25.891
Uh, it's just...

07:25.893 --> 07:27.559
Uh...

07:27.561 --> 07:29.762
You got something?

07:29.764 --> 07:31.697
Um, u-unfortunately, no.

07:31.699 --> 07:34.867
There's nothing from the crime
scene that turned up any clues.

07:34.869 --> 07:37.469
No prints, trace evidence,
DNA, nothing.

07:37.471 --> 07:39.872
Whoever did this obviously
knows what they're doing.

07:39.874 --> 07:41.907
You want me
to keep trying?

07:41.909 --> 07:43.442
NCIS probably doesn't
need me back for awhile.

07:43.444 --> 07:45.644
Glass tray.

07:46.514 --> 07:47.980
What is it?

07:47.982 --> 07:50.849
I mean, clearly,
it's a strand of hair, but...?

07:50.851 --> 07:52.384
I found it
in the victim's hair.

07:52.386 --> 07:54.086
It's not hers.

07:55.055 --> 07:57.489
Could be the killer's.

07:58.726 --> 08:00.426
And, if I'm right,

08:00.428 --> 08:02.995
I've crossed paths
with him before.

08:15.009 --> 08:17.743
Yo, I'm not bragging, but I got
a pretty good track record

08:17.745 --> 08:20.879
when it comes to matchmaking,
just not for myself, mind you,

08:20.881 --> 08:22.347
that's a whole
different story.

08:22.349 --> 08:23.582
Well, why is that?

08:23.584 --> 08:26.051
You know, it's
just complicated.

08:49.777 --> 08:52.644
Looks like we just
missed somebody.

08:57.218 --> 08:59.318
“Jack Gordon.
Clozapine”

08:59.320 --> 09:00.752
Clozapine?

09:00.754 --> 09:02.454
Is that for psychosis?
Schizophrenia?

09:02.478 --> 09:03.649
Mm-hmm.

09:20.975 --> 09:23.976
Looks like we've found
where Chief Decker was murdered.

09:23.978 --> 09:27.212
Which means we've found
our monster.

09:28.549 --> 09:29.982
<i>Good job, Christopher.</i>

09:29.984 --> 09:32.117
Secure the scene,
get a BOLO out.

09:32.119 --> 09:33.819
I'll send Sebastian
to collect evidence.

09:35.456 --> 09:37.756
Loretta, we might have...

09:40.427 --> 09:41.627
Loretta.

09:41.629 --> 09:43.462
Might have a suspect.

09:43.464 --> 09:45.497
Ex-con, just got paroled.

09:45.499 --> 09:46.965
Jack Gordon.

09:46.967 --> 09:48.367
Yeah. How'd you know?

09:48.369 --> 09:49.635
I worked the case

09:49.637 --> 09:51.937
on his first victim
20 years ago.

09:55.910 --> 09:57.609
And, if he did this...

09:59.647 --> 10:02.614
...I could very well be next.

10:23.216 --> 10:25.350
She all right?

10:25.352 --> 10:26.851
Don't know.

10:26.853 --> 10:28.687
Tough lady.

10:28.689 --> 10:31.756
I've never seen her
rattled like this before.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.393
Tell me things.

10:35.395 --> 10:36.961
Jack Gordon,

10:36.963 --> 10:38.530
aka “The Jackknife,”

10:38.532 --> 10:40.632
paroled eight days ago
from Angola after serving

10:40.634 --> 10:43.068
just over 20 years
for murder.

10:43.070 --> 10:45.470
Loretta said he was a streetcar
driver back in the day?

10:45.472 --> 10:47.472
Drove streetcar number 963,

10:47.474 --> 10:49.240
the same streetcar
Chief Decker's body

10:49.242 --> 10:50.542
was strung up behind.

10:50.544 --> 10:51.910
Hard to believe
it's a coincidence.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.878
Yeah, plus the blood
we found at the school

10:53.880 --> 10:56.114
is a dead match to
Decker, which means...

10:56.116 --> 10:57.649
Decker was killed at the school,

10:57.651 --> 10:59.351
then moved to the streetcar.

10:59.353 --> 11:00.985
Guy's out of prison
barely a week,

11:00.987 --> 11:02.153
immediately targets Decker,

11:02.155 --> 11:03.421
and kills her the same way

11:03.423 --> 11:05.023
he killed a woman
20 years ago.

11:05.025 --> 11:07.258
Petty Officer Janet Ortega.

11:07.260 --> 11:10.895
She and Decker were bunkmates

11:10.897 --> 11:14.499
on the U.S.S. <i>Enterprise</i> in '97.

11:14.501 --> 11:16.501
And Ortega and Jack Gordon

11:16.503 --> 11:18.269
were high school
sweethearts back then.

11:18.271 --> 11:19.671
Some sweetheart.

11:19.673 --> 11:21.473
Never proved motive,
but it's got

11:21.475 --> 11:22.741
crime of passion
written all over it.

11:22.743 --> 11:25.009
Yeah, well, I remember
the Ortega case.

11:25.011 --> 11:27.045
NOPD handled it
when I was a sheriff.

11:27.047 --> 11:29.347
Gordon got his nickname because

11:29.349 --> 11:31.082
the murder weapon was a knife.

11:31.084 --> 11:33.451
Jack Gordon, Jackknife, cute.

11:33.453 --> 11:36.020
But why kill Chief Decker as
soon as he gets out of prison?

11:36.022 --> 11:38.256
And make it so obvious
that he did it?

11:38.258 --> 11:40.392
Well, we need to dig
into the old case,

11:40.394 --> 11:42.060
but if I remember right,

11:42.062 --> 11:45.897
Chief Decker testified
against Gordon at the trial,

11:45.899 --> 11:47.465
claimed he was unstable.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.100
Well, based on the empty bottle
of clozapine we found

11:49.102 --> 11:51.636
at the school,
he's even more unstable now.

11:51.638 --> 11:52.837
Plus, his DNA

11:52.839 --> 11:54.038
matched a strand of hair

11:54.040 --> 11:56.040
Doc found on the victim.

11:56.042 --> 11:57.942
Well, it's pretty
clear, isn't it?

11:57.944 --> 11:59.878
Gordon gets out of prison,
takes out his revenge on Decker

11:59.880 --> 12:02.480
for testifying against him
20 years ago.

12:02.482 --> 12:04.816
Problem is,
according to Loretta,

12:04.818 --> 12:09.254
she testified against Gordon
20 years ago, too.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.960
I was the M.E.
on Janet Ortega's case.

12:15.962 --> 12:20.031
The slaying was...
brutal, sick.

12:20.033 --> 12:22.467
Gordon claimed he was
innocent, of course,

12:22.469 --> 12:24.836
but the evidence
was overwhelming.

12:24.838 --> 12:28.540
Ortega's body showed signs
of previous assaults.

12:28.542 --> 12:31.309
The knife they found at the
crime scene belonged to Gordon,

12:31.311 --> 12:33.077
and he was so hopped up
on amphetamines,

12:33.079 --> 12:34.479
when they went to arrest him,

12:34.481 --> 12:35.914
he couldn't even remember
where he was

12:35.916 --> 12:37.081
the night of the murder.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.750
Amphetamine psychosis

12:38.752 --> 12:40.485
certainly could explain
that level of violence.

12:40.487 --> 12:42.187
Nothing explains
what he did

12:42.189 --> 12:43.888
to that poor woman.

12:43.890 --> 12:47.859
I just never understood
why the prosecutor cut a deal.

12:47.861 --> 12:49.727
She should've put
that man away for life.

12:49.729 --> 12:51.529
And now look what happened.

12:51.531 --> 12:53.198
You've got to
find him, Dwayne,

12:53.200 --> 12:54.833
before he hurts anybody else.

12:54.835 --> 12:58.036
We're gonna do everything
we possibly can, Loretta.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.370
Still, if Gordon

12:59.372 --> 13:01.005
did kill Chief Decker,

13:01.007 --> 13:03.808
why did he call her so many
times in the days before?

13:03.810 --> 13:05.276
Taunting her, maybe?

13:05.278 --> 13:06.744
Yeah, but, why would
she accept them?

13:06.746 --> 13:09.447
Why not just hang up and
alert the NOPD instead?

13:09.449 --> 13:10.782
He hasn't tried
calling you, has he?

13:10.784 --> 13:12.584
- He wouldn't dare.
- Nevertheless,

13:12.586 --> 13:14.252
if, in fact, he's
targeting people

13:14.254 --> 13:17.055
who testified against him,
we've got to protect you

13:17.057 --> 13:18.089
until we find him.

13:18.091 --> 13:19.390
I can take care of myself.

13:19.392 --> 13:20.758
Not this time, you can't.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.994
Until we know
exactly what's going on,

13:22.996 --> 13:25.463
safest place for you is with us.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.433
Which means, CJ...

13:28.435 --> 13:32.237
I spoke with Danny, and CJ's
on base with his brother.

13:32.239 --> 13:33.438
All right, well, good.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.973
In the meantime,
we need to find out

13:34.975 --> 13:38.443
who else testified
against Gordon, warn them.

13:38.445 --> 13:41.846
You should look into the defense
attorney, Devon Mitchell.

13:41.848 --> 13:45.383
I remember Gordon blamed him
for not getting him acquitted.

13:45.385 --> 13:47.085
Let's find Mitchell.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.621
Patton and I will get
up to speed on the old case

13:49.623 --> 13:50.855
as quickly as possible.

13:50.857 --> 13:52.690
Try to get leads
on how to find Gordon.

13:52.692 --> 13:54.626
- Go.
- You got it.

13:56.897 --> 13:58.563
We'll find him, Loretta.
Yeah.

13:58.565 --> 13:59.864
I promise.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.562
Can I help you?

14:30.564 --> 14:32.397
Special Agents
Lasalle and Gregorio.

14:32.399 --> 14:34.933
We need to speak to
Mr. Mitchell, please.

14:34.935 --> 14:37.268
Oh, don't worry, he hasn't
done anything wrong.

14:37.270 --> 14:39.203
But we do need
to speak to him.

14:39.205 --> 14:41.172
Of course. I'll let him know.

14:41.174 --> 14:43.007
Thank you kindly.

14:46.646 --> 14:48.046
Mr. Mitchell...

14:48.048 --> 14:50.782
That's exactly the eye contact
I'm talking about.

14:50.784 --> 14:52.650
Clear connection,
no doubt about it.

14:52.652 --> 14:54.686
I'm not doing this
with you, Gregorio.

14:54.688 --> 14:57.255
The chemistry is
immediately palpable,

14:57.257 --> 14:59.924
you can't fake that;
even I can feel it.

15:02.329 --> 15:05.496
If you don't go
for her, I will.

15:05.498 --> 15:07.031
What?

15:07.033 --> 15:08.666
<i>Are you sure?</i>

15:08.668 --> 15:11.603
I mean, I didn't even know
that Jack was out.

15:11.605 --> 15:14.772
He hasn't tried
to contact you, or call you?

15:14.774 --> 15:16.140
No, nothing.

15:16.142 --> 15:17.475
You really think
that he killed Karen Decker,

15:17.477 --> 15:18.710
just because she testified
against him?

15:18.712 --> 15:19.978
That's what
we're trying

15:19.980 --> 15:21.679
to find out, Mr. Mitchell,
but if he did,

15:21.681 --> 15:23.314
you could be in danger, too.

15:23.316 --> 15:26.217
Yeah, we heard Gordon was
particularly upset with you

15:26.219 --> 15:27.652
for not getting him acquitted.

15:27.654 --> 15:30.121
I did everything that I could.

15:30.123 --> 15:32.090
I even took the
case pro Bono.

15:32.092 --> 15:33.491
I mean, I knew Jack.

15:33.493 --> 15:35.026
He was the streetcar driver

15:35.028 --> 15:36.794
who took me to work here
every day.

15:36.796 --> 15:38.162
I didn't want him
to get stuck with a PD,

15:38.164 --> 15:39.697
so I offered to defend him.

15:39.699 --> 15:41.532
So you haven't talked
to him since the trial?

15:41.534 --> 15:43.034
I called him in prison
to check up on him,

15:43.036 --> 15:44.902
but all he ever wanted me
to do was get the case reopened.

15:44.904 --> 15:46.871
Because he still believed
he was innocent?

15:46.873 --> 15:48.039
He never stopped believing it.

15:48.041 --> 15:49.374
Didn't change
the facts of the case,

15:49.376 --> 15:52.043
but Jack never really cared
about facts.

15:53.713 --> 15:56.147
Look, if anything,
Jack owes me.

15:56.149 --> 15:57.782
I got the D.A. to agree
to a reduced sentence

15:57.784 --> 15:59.217
based on Jack's mental state.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.586
I mean, I saved his life.

16:01.588 --> 16:02.954
Why would he be after me?

16:02.956 --> 16:04.589
We're not sure he is,
Mr. Mitchell,

16:04.591 --> 16:07.058
but we're gonna get you
protection just in case.

16:08.528 --> 16:09.994
Is there anything you
remember that might help us

16:09.996 --> 16:12.930
find Gordon?
Family or friends?

16:12.932 --> 16:14.565
Well, we're especially concerned
about anybody else

16:14.567 --> 16:16.067
Gordon might be after.

16:16.069 --> 16:17.468
We're putting together
a list, that...

16:17.470 --> 16:19.637
Uh, Todd Borger.

16:19.639 --> 16:20.805
Friend of Jack's,
drove the night shift.

16:20.807 --> 16:22.707
You need to protect him.

16:22.709 --> 16:24.709
The D.A. tripped Borger up
on the stand,

16:24.711 --> 16:26.177
got him to admit that Jack

16:26.179 --> 16:27.478
was violent, jealous.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.647
Between that
and the coroner's testimony,

16:29.649 --> 16:31.416
the jury was ready to convict.

16:31.418 --> 16:33.017
Murder one.

16:34.154 --> 16:35.753
<i>There's no doubt,</i>

16:35.755 --> 16:37.889
Jack Gordon
murdered Petty Officer Ortega.

16:37.891 --> 16:39.557
That is my professional
opinion,

16:39.559 --> 16:41.959
and it is my personal opinion.

16:41.961 --> 16:43.761
Objection, Your Honor.
Dr. Wade is qualified

16:43.763 --> 16:44.996
only for expert testimony.

16:44.998 --> 16:46.230
Sustained.
Please, just answer...

16:46.232 --> 16:48.132
Court footage
of the Ortega case?

16:48.134 --> 16:51.302
Yeah. Circa court 1997.

16:51.304 --> 16:54.872
Just saying, Dr. Wade
looking mighty fine.

16:54.874 --> 16:56.074
And pissed, too.

16:56.076 --> 16:58.276
Yeah. Wasn't an ordinary case.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.844
Horrendous murder.

16:59.846 --> 17:01.446
Lot of emotions.

17:01.448 --> 17:04.781
Yeah, well, the good
Dr. Wade's barely hiding hers.

17:04.784 --> 17:07.085
...oftentimes
is a precursor for murder.

17:07.087 --> 17:08.752
Objection.

17:08.755 --> 17:10.121
And you think the defendant's

17:10.123 --> 17:11.289
mental illness could've made him

17:11.290 --> 17:12.857
capable of extreme violence?

17:12.858 --> 17:14.525
Objection,
she's not a psychologist.

17:14.527 --> 17:16.993
I will allow it.
I didn't kill her! I'm innocent!

17:16.996 --> 17:18.563
Forensics don't lie!
I didn't do it!

17:18.565 --> 17:19.664
I didn't do it, and you know
I didn't do it!

17:19.665 --> 17:21.365
Mr. Gordon, Mr. Gordon!

17:21.367 --> 17:23.300
I didn't kill her!
The hell you didn't!

17:23.303 --> 17:24.435
I didn't do it!

17:24.436 --> 17:26.503
You know that's not true!
I didn't do it!

17:26.506 --> 17:28.306
The hell you didn't!

17:28.308 --> 17:30.308
My behavior was inexcusable.

17:31.644 --> 17:34.912
The past has a way of catching
up to you, doesn't it?

17:48.128 --> 17:50.461
<i>I don't know.</i>

17:50.463 --> 17:52.396
There's just something
about this case

17:52.398 --> 17:55.700
that I just personalized.

17:55.702 --> 17:57.668
I was supposed
to state the facts,

17:57.670 --> 18:00.538
as I knew them.

18:00.540 --> 18:01.806
The science.

18:01.808 --> 18:04.041
Not give my opinion
on innocent or guilt.

18:04.043 --> 18:05.176
Yet Gordon was guilty.

18:05.178 --> 18:06.410
He pled out, he confessed.

18:06.412 --> 18:07.578
But why?

18:07.580 --> 18:09.413
Was he really guilty,

18:09.415 --> 18:13.618
or did I sway the jury with
something other than facts?

18:13.620 --> 18:16.120
Loretta, you've testified in
dozens of cases over the years.

18:16.122 --> 18:18.456
Why are you beating yourself up
over this one?

18:18.458 --> 18:20.224
You know why, Dwayne.

18:20.226 --> 18:21.859
You saw the courtroom footage.

18:21.861 --> 18:23.594
I wasn't myself.

18:24.864 --> 18:27.598
And I've known it
for a long time, too.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.768
I just never wanted to face it.

18:39.669 --> 18:41.546
<i>Jack and I grew up together.</i>

18:41.548 --> 18:43.848
We went to high school,
joined the transit authority.

18:43.850 --> 18:46.851
Back then, streetcars only used
one driver both ways.

18:46.853 --> 18:49.220
I take it you knew
Janet Ortega, too?

18:49.222 --> 18:51.923
Well, sure. She rode
Jack's streetcar to work

18:51.925 --> 18:54.325
on the early shift,
mine back home at night.

18:54.327 --> 18:56.127
Saw her pretty
much every day.

18:56.129 --> 18:57.595
She and Jack were good together.

18:57.597 --> 18:59.096
Until he killed her.

18:59.098 --> 19:00.998
Still can't believe he did it.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.867
Meaning, what?
You think he was innocent?

19:02.869 --> 19:05.469
At the time, yeah. I mean,
I know how much he loved her.

19:05.471 --> 19:08.139
Jack struggled
with paranoia and delusions

19:08.141 --> 19:09.340
his whole life.

19:09.342 --> 19:11.709
I thought he had it
under control.

19:11.711 --> 19:13.711
Is that what the D.A.
got you to say in court?

19:13.713 --> 19:15.880
Yeah. It helped send him away.

19:15.882 --> 19:18.349
Yeah, well, he's out now,
and if he killed Karen Decker

19:18.351 --> 19:20.585
out of revenge,
then you're not safe, either.

19:20.587 --> 19:22.053
Is there any chance
you might help us figure out

19:22.055 --> 19:23.955
where Gordon might be?

19:23.957 --> 19:25.790
I mean, the sooner we
get him off the streets,

19:25.792 --> 19:28.860
the sooner the people who
testified against him are safe.

19:28.862 --> 19:30.728
I think I saw Jack
earlier today,

19:30.730 --> 19:32.263
across the street
from the station.

19:32.265 --> 19:33.998
So, why didn't
you call the police?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.900
I wasn't sure it was him.

19:35.902 --> 19:38.302
Besides, I didn't know
he'd just killed somebody else.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.680
Uh, good news.
Mm-hmm.

19:49.682 --> 19:52.149
Christopher says everyone
who testified against Gordon,

19:52.151 --> 19:54.118
under police protection.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.586
Apparently, so am I. Here.

19:56.756 --> 19:58.256
Oh, by the way. I don't snore.

19:58.258 --> 20:00.992
At least, not that I know of,
anymore.

20:02.128 --> 20:04.061
I don't know if I do anymore.

20:04.063 --> 20:06.430
You think either of us will
ever get married again?

20:06.432 --> 20:09.066
Oh, I'm not in
any hurry, myself. You?

20:09.068 --> 20:11.969
If the right person
came along, maybe.

20:11.971 --> 20:14.872
Last one kind of soured me
on the idea.

20:14.874 --> 20:17.074
Yeah. Long time ago, though.

20:18.144 --> 20:22.046
Divorce happened just before
Gordon's case, didn't it?

20:22.048 --> 20:24.081
That's the reason I moved here.

20:24.083 --> 20:26.284
New beginnings and all.

20:26.286 --> 20:28.252
Yeah. A lot to go through.

20:29.989 --> 20:33.925
Gordon's case
must've made it even harder.

20:33.927 --> 20:36.127
Where are we going
with all this, Dwayne?

20:36.129 --> 20:38.129
Not going anywhere, just...

20:38.131 --> 20:42.133
I know that your husband didn't
treat you right, either, so...

20:42.135 --> 20:44.335
No, it isn't that he didn't
treat me right.

20:44.337 --> 20:47.872
You know it. He froze me out.

20:47.874 --> 20:49.607
He wasn't like this at first,

20:49.609 --> 20:53.778
just started
to resent my success.

20:53.780 --> 20:55.313
Then it got even worse

20:55.315 --> 20:59.383
when they passed him over
for others less qualified.

20:59.385 --> 21:01.285
Then he got mean.

21:02.422 --> 21:04.188
It took a long time to find
the courage to leave him,

21:04.190 --> 21:05.990
but I finally did.

21:05.992 --> 21:07.758
I was lucky.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.328
Luckier than Janet Ortega.

21:10.330 --> 21:12.096
You were both victims.

21:12.098 --> 21:14.198
And they were both abusers.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.000
But I was still

21:16.002 --> 21:21.172
so upset and so angry
with how Reginald treated me,

21:21.174 --> 21:24.575
that when I testify, I projected
all that onto Gordon.

21:24.577 --> 21:26.110
And...

21:26.112 --> 21:28.479
ever since,

21:28.481 --> 21:31.916
I've worried that I biased
the jury against him.

21:31.918 --> 21:35.252
It doesn't change the fact
that the evidence against Gordon

21:35.254 --> 21:37.188
was overwhelming.

21:37.190 --> 21:38.756
Wasn't just your testimony.

21:38.758 --> 21:41.092
But my testimony
made an impact.

21:41.094 --> 21:42.960
I saw it in each

21:42.962 --> 21:46.097
and every one of
the juror's faces.

21:48.067 --> 21:51.102
I wasn't trying to make
Gordon pay.

21:51.104 --> 21:53.904
I was trying to make
my husband pay.

21:55.575 --> 21:58.476
And it's haunted me
ever since.

22:04.917 --> 22:09.253
Loretta.

22:09.255 --> 22:10.755
Don't move,

22:10.757 --> 22:12.890
and stay calm.

22:12.892 --> 22:15.559
Okay?

22:15.561 --> 22:17.862
Gordon.
Mm-hmm.

22:17.864 --> 22:19.697
Outside.

22:19.699 --> 22:22.800
Just wait a minute
and call 911.

22:22.802 --> 22:24.769
I'm gonna go
get this blanket,

22:24.771 --> 22:26.203
pillows.

22:26.205 --> 22:29.373
Put them out on the sofa,
I'll be right back.

22:39.185 --> 22:41.118
Oh!

22:47.427 --> 22:49.260
Get off me!
Calm down, Gordon.

22:49.262 --> 22:50.928
Stop fighting.
Relax.

22:50.930 --> 22:52.363
Relax.

22:52.365 --> 22:53.531
Stop fighting.

22:53.533 --> 22:55.199
You're under arrest, Gordon,

22:55.201 --> 22:56.667
for the murder of Karen Decker.

22:56.669 --> 22:58.869
I didn't do it.

23:11.950 --> 23:13.817
I didn't do it!

23:13.819 --> 23:16.320
The blood at the school
wasn't me!

23:16.707 --> 23:18.873
You just don't understand!

23:18.875 --> 23:21.643
Help me understand,
Gordon,

23:21.645 --> 23:24.813
what were you doing
outside Dr. Wade's house.

23:24.815 --> 23:27.682
I need my meds.
Get me my meds!

23:27.684 --> 23:30.118
I'm getting them.
The agitation you're feeling

23:30.120 --> 23:32.387
right now is
clozapine withdrawal.

23:32.389 --> 23:34.522
You're not
going anywhere.

23:34.524 --> 23:35.757
Try and breathe.

23:35.759 --> 23:36.991
Swallow.

23:36.993 --> 23:38.293
Who's there?

23:38.295 --> 23:39.861
Who's on the other
side of there?!

23:39.863 --> 23:41.329
There's somebody
looking at me!

23:41.331 --> 23:42.564
I know there is!

23:42.566 --> 23:44.566
Who's on the other side?

23:44.568 --> 23:48.503
Dr. Wade, is that you?

23:48.505 --> 23:50.839
I wasn't gonna hurt you,
I swear.

23:50.841 --> 23:52.273
I just wanted your help!

23:52.275 --> 23:53.341
Talk to me.

23:53.343 --> 23:54.876
Gordon, look at me.

23:54.878 --> 23:57.212
What do you mean when you say
you want her help?

23:57.214 --> 23:58.546
For what, medication?

23:58.548 --> 23:59.814
No, no.

23:59.816 --> 24:02.117
I just want... I wanted her!

24:03.920 --> 24:06.254
I need someone
to believe me!

24:07.524 --> 24:09.958
I didn't kill Janet!

24:09.960 --> 24:11.860
I swear to God.

24:11.862 --> 24:14.062
I didn't kill Janet!

24:18.535 --> 24:21.136
If Gordon didn't
kill Janet Ortega,

24:21.138 --> 24:23.772
he didn't kill
Chief Decker either.

24:23.774 --> 24:26.074
All right, slow down,
okay?

24:26.076 --> 24:28.209
Just 'cause he claims he's
innocent, doesn't mean he is.

24:28.211 --> 24:29.911
He's a desperate man.

24:29.913 --> 24:33.181
Yes, but he has been claiming
his innocence for over 20 years.

24:33.183 --> 24:36.050
Guilty or not,
we have to be sure.

24:36.052 --> 24:38.186
Gonna give him his clozapine,

24:38.188 --> 24:40.388
then talk again
after he settles down.

24:40.390 --> 24:42.757
We're gonna take this
one step at a time,

24:42.759 --> 24:44.159
just like we always do.

24:44.161 --> 24:45.560
Maybe there's
something I missed.

24:45.562 --> 24:46.895
Or maybe it was
really because

24:46.897 --> 24:48.696
I just wanted
him to be guilty.

24:48.698 --> 24:51.166
Loretta...

24:51.168 --> 24:54.502
I need to check,
you need to check.

24:54.504 --> 24:56.738
Because if Jack Gordon
is innocent,

24:56.740 --> 24:59.474
then the killer is
still out there.

25:07.751 --> 25:09.918
You want one of us to stay with
her, make sure she's safe?

25:09.920 --> 25:11.553
She'll be okay.

25:11.555 --> 25:14.222
Killer's either locked up
in our interrogation room,

25:14.224 --> 25:15.890
or out there thinking
he's won the game.

25:15.892 --> 25:17.959
Killing again would just
prove Gordon innocent.

25:17.961 --> 25:19.761
You're not convinced Gordon's
our killer, are you?

25:19.763 --> 25:21.296
I'm convinced
there's a possibility

25:21.298 --> 25:22.497
he's telling the truth,

25:22.499 --> 25:23.798
so we're gonna keep
investigating.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.667
Well, all due respect
to the doc,

25:25.669 --> 25:27.101
but somebody would be going
through a lot of trouble

25:27.103 --> 25:28.670
to set Gordon up twice

25:28.672 --> 25:30.171
across a span of 20 years.

25:30.173 --> 25:31.906
I admit it's a stretch,

25:31.908 --> 25:35.043
but like Loretta says,
we need to be sure.

25:35.045 --> 25:36.711
All right,
what's the plan?

25:36.713 --> 25:38.680
Loretta's gonna review
the forensic evidence

25:38.682 --> 25:41.049
on Janet Ortega, in case
she missed anything.

25:41.051 --> 25:42.951
Gonna ask the D.A.
to exhume the body.

25:42.953 --> 25:44.652
That means I need you
to go to Morgan City,

25:44.654 --> 25:46.162
pick it up and
get it to the morgue.

25:46.163 --> 25:46.819
You got it.

25:46.823 --> 25:49.023
You and Patton need
to comb through both

25:49.025 --> 25:51.292
Ortega's murder and Decker's.

25:51.294 --> 25:53.695
See if you can find
a connection to anybody else

25:53.697 --> 25:55.763
other than Gordon.

25:55.765 --> 25:57.498
Pills, King.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.000
If somebody had 20 years

25:59.002 --> 26:00.702
to frame Gordon
for another murder,

26:00.704 --> 26:02.270
chances are they didn't
make a mistake.

26:02.272 --> 26:04.138
But if they did,
we need to find it.

26:04.140 --> 26:06.040
We need to be right
about this.

26:06.042 --> 26:08.977
Both for Gordon and Loretta.
Okay.

26:19.022 --> 26:20.655
Knock, knock.

26:21.992 --> 26:23.658
It's okay, Sebastian,
come in.

26:23.660 --> 26:25.493
Okay, cool, I didn't want
to scare you again.

26:25.495 --> 26:26.828
Kind of freaked me
out last time.

26:26.830 --> 26:28.162
Not your fault,
obviously.

26:28.164 --> 26:29.731
It's just childhood issues.

26:29.733 --> 26:31.266
You know, jumpy mother.

26:31.268 --> 26:32.834
I'm thinking I should
get into therapy...

26:32.836 --> 26:34.969
That for me?
It is.

26:34.971 --> 26:36.971
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Anyway, uh,

26:36.973 --> 26:40.174
the D.A. released Ortega's old
case evidence from Property.

26:40.176 --> 26:41.542
What are we looking for?

26:41.544 --> 26:43.378
Frankly, I'm not sure,

26:43.380 --> 26:45.413
but I want to be sure
I didn't miss something.

26:45.415 --> 26:46.881
I perused the case file.

26:46.883 --> 26:47.982
I don't think you did.

26:47.984 --> 26:49.384
I mean, every “I” is dotted,

26:49.386 --> 26:51.152
every “T” is crossed on your
forensic findings.

26:51.154 --> 26:53.588
At least, you know, to my eye.

26:53.590 --> 26:56.758
Can never be too certain.
There's too much at stake.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.593
Meanwhile...

26:59.930 --> 27:02.130
...you mind to take
a closer look at this?

27:03.033 --> 27:04.499
What is this, the hair
sample you found

27:04.501 --> 27:06.067
on Chief Decker's body?

27:06.069 --> 27:08.369
I already identified it
as Gordon's.

27:08.371 --> 27:10.872
Mm-hmm, but we need to know
if it fell from his person,

27:10.874 --> 27:13.374
or if it was placed
on the victim by someone else.

27:13.376 --> 27:14.709
You think Gordon was set up?

27:14.711 --> 27:18.246
Do a calcium carbonate test.
Let's find out.

27:31.695 --> 27:35.096
You can uncuff me now.
I ain't gonna hurt you.

27:35.098 --> 27:40.001
Well... at least
till the meds wear off.

27:56.286 --> 27:57.952
Thank you.

28:03.460 --> 28:07.028
Jack Gordon...

28:07.030 --> 28:11.766
pled guilty to killing
Janet Ortega 20 years ago.

28:11.768 --> 28:13.968
A week after your release,

28:13.970 --> 28:15.770
a key witness
against you was murdered

28:15.772 --> 28:17.005
in the exact same way.

28:17.007 --> 28:18.439
Why should I believe
you're innocent?

28:18.441 --> 28:20.641
Because I am innocent.

28:20.643 --> 28:22.643
I never stopped trying
to prove it, never will.

28:22.645 --> 28:25.246
Why'd you call Chief Decker
the moment you were paroled?

28:25.248 --> 28:27.482
Because I needed her help to
prove I didn't kill Janet.

28:27.484 --> 28:30.651
I convinced her
I wasn't guilty.

28:30.653 --> 28:33.888
So, somebody set you up
20 years ago?

28:33.890 --> 28:36.691
Somebody set you up yesterday--
is that what you're saying?

28:36.693 --> 28:38.526
I know how
this looks, okay?

28:38.528 --> 28:42.263
I'm a diagnosed
schizophrenic.

28:42.265 --> 28:46.034
But you have to understand,
I loved Janet.

28:46.036 --> 28:49.337
When she joined the Navy to get
away, it nearly destroyed me.

28:49.339 --> 28:51.939
The murder weapon,
the jackknife--

28:51.941 --> 28:54.275
Jack's knife--
belonged to you.

28:54.277 --> 28:56.644
I gave Janet that knife
for protection.

28:56.646 --> 28:58.379
From me.

28:58.381 --> 29:01.616
I got crazy at times.

29:01.618 --> 29:03.785
And I abused her when I wasn't
in my right mind, I know.

29:03.787 --> 29:05.787
But that's why I wanted
Janet to be able

29:05.789 --> 29:07.889
to protect herself in case.

29:07.891 --> 29:09.791
She had to leave me.

29:09.793 --> 29:13.428
I could never kill her,
Agent Pride.

29:13.430 --> 29:15.997
Same way I could never
kill Karen Decker.

29:15.999 --> 29:18.499
Karen was the only one
willing to help me.

29:18.501 --> 29:20.835
Wh-Why would I?

29:20.837 --> 29:23.271
So let's say I believe you.

29:23.273 --> 29:24.939
Who set you up?

29:24.941 --> 29:26.607
You must have some idea.

29:26.609 --> 29:31.245
All I know is someone
else liked Janet,

29:31.247 --> 29:32.814
and they was pursuing her.

29:32.816 --> 29:35.483
It had to be
whoever killed her

29:35.485 --> 29:37.018
killed Karen Decker, too.

29:37.020 --> 29:38.853
And maybe they thought
we was close

29:38.855 --> 29:40.388
to figuring out who they was.

29:40.390 --> 29:41.656
Close? How?

29:41.658 --> 29:43.224
What do you mean?

29:43.226 --> 29:44.659
The Innocence Project--
they gave me

29:44.661 --> 29:46.761
my case files
while I was in prison.

29:46.763 --> 29:49.297
Okay, I poured over the files,
I didn't find anything...

29:49.299 --> 29:52.300
till I found
this one photo of Janet.

29:52.302 --> 29:53.768
Last time I saw her,

29:53.770 --> 29:55.837
an hour before she was killed,

29:55.839 --> 29:58.005
she was wearing a necklace...

29:58.007 --> 30:00.274
with a purple gemstone...

30:00.276 --> 30:02.777
but it wasn't from me.

30:02.779 --> 30:04.278
- So?
- So it wasn't

30:04.280 --> 30:05.847
on the body when she was found.

30:05.849 --> 30:08.382
And I looked
at every crime scene photo,

30:08.384 --> 30:09.617
and it wasn't there.

30:09.619 --> 30:11.385
Killer took it.
'Cause he knew

30:11.387 --> 30:13.221
that it might
connect back to him.

30:13.223 --> 30:15.590
You could check
the photos yourself,

30:15.592 --> 30:17.625
and you'll see I'm right.

30:18.895 --> 30:21.496
You'll see I didn't do this.

30:27.737 --> 30:29.270
You find something?

30:29.272 --> 30:31.005
I think maybe, yeah.

30:31.007 --> 30:34.175
Gordon's hair had trace amounts
of calcium carbonate on it.

30:34.177 --> 30:35.943
Transferred from the latex
gloves the killer used

30:35.945 --> 30:38.333
to plant a hair
on Chief Decker's body.

30:38.334 --> 30:38.844
Yeah.

30:38.848 --> 30:41.048
Which means if Gordon
didn't kill Chief Decker...

30:41.050 --> 30:42.683
he probably didn't kill
Janet Ortega, either.

30:42.685 --> 30:43.918
Which also means

30:43.920 --> 30:48.222
an innocent man spent 20 years
of his life in prison,

30:48.224 --> 30:51.125
and I helped send him there.

31:06.374 --> 31:07.885
Nothing else?
No other connections

31:07.909 --> 31:09.909
to the other murders other
than how they were killed?

31:09.911 --> 31:11.410
Nothing we can
find so far

31:11.412 --> 31:13.446
other than the obvious
connection to Gordon.

31:13.448 --> 31:15.181
It's too obvious
for my taste.

31:15.183 --> 31:16.916
Too clean, too.

31:16.918 --> 31:19.285
Yeah.
If Gordon didn't do it...

31:19.287 --> 31:21.320
whoever did knew how
to cover their tracks.

31:21.322 --> 31:23.756
Like someone in the Navy
or law enforcement--

31:23.758 --> 31:25.725
but we checked
both victims' records,

31:25.727 --> 31:27.860
nothing jumps out.
Nothing to confirm

31:27.862 --> 31:30.796
Gordon's claim of Janet Ortega's
mystery suitor?

31:30.798 --> 31:32.598
Nothing other than the
purple gemstone necklace.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.034
However,
the victim was wearing it

31:35.036 --> 31:36.769
right before she got killed,
like Gordon said.

31:36.771 --> 31:39.372
This is from a
surveillance camera

31:39.374 --> 31:42.141
at the Decatur streetcar
station that same night,

31:42.143 --> 31:43.209
20 years ago.

31:43.211 --> 31:44.510
Except,

31:44.512 --> 31:45.911
she wasn't wearing it

31:45.913 --> 31:48.981
after she was killed,

31:48.983 --> 31:50.049
also like Gordon said.

31:50.051 --> 31:51.684
Well, it makes sense,
right?

31:51.686 --> 31:53.719
Killer doesn't want
anybody tracing it back to him.

31:53.721 --> 31:56.655
You know what? I'm starting
to think maybe Gordon's right,

31:56.657 --> 31:58.057
somebody's setting him up.

31:58.059 --> 32:00.159
Especially since
the more grisly

32:00.161 --> 32:01.460
and violent the murders appear,

32:01.462 --> 32:04.897
the more a jury's
predisposed to believe

32:04.899 --> 32:07.032
that abuse and mental illness
could be the cause.

32:07.034 --> 32:08.567
Problem is, other
than Gordon's claim,

32:08.569 --> 32:11.637
we don't have much,
if anything, to go on.

32:11.639 --> 32:14.874
But we find out who
gave Janet Ortega that necklace,

32:14.876 --> 32:16.342
and we will.

32:21.883 --> 32:24.049
Took 'em longer
than they thought to dig it out,

32:24.051 --> 32:25.518
that ground
was still pretty damp.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.486
Fortunately for us,
burying the deceased

32:27.488 --> 32:29.855
in cemeteries
near peatland marshes

32:29.857 --> 32:32.391
prevents putrefaction,
decomposition.

32:32.393 --> 32:34.226
You really think
she can tell us something

32:34.228 --> 32:35.194
after all this time?

32:35.196 --> 32:36.395
Time may
heal all wounds,

32:36.397 --> 32:38.631
dear, but not when you're dead.

32:38.633 --> 32:39.999
Still, it's
hard to believe

32:40.001 --> 32:42.234
you, of all people,
missed something.

32:43.504 --> 32:46.405
Yes, well,
if Jack Gordon is innocent,

32:46.407 --> 32:48.040
then I must have.

32:49.410 --> 32:50.810
I'm headed back to headquarters,

32:50.812 --> 32:52.111
to help them find that necklace.

32:52.113 --> 32:53.512
Keep me posted.

32:53.514 --> 32:55.014
So these are

32:55.016 --> 32:56.849
Ortega's original autopsy photos?
Yes, uh,

32:56.851 --> 32:58.317
this is the one
of particular interest

32:58.319 --> 33:00.553
of the back of her neck.

33:01.489 --> 33:03.255
Oh, yeah,
some kind of abrasion.

33:03.257 --> 33:06.392
At the time, I noted it
as consistent with other wounds

33:06.394 --> 33:08.260
likely inflicted
when she was dragged

33:08.262 --> 33:09.462
to the car,

33:09.464 --> 33:11.664
but after hearing
about the necklace...

33:11.666 --> 33:13.299
It could be the wound
was caused when someone

33:13.301 --> 33:14.533
ripped it off her neck.

33:14.535 --> 33:15.968
If so,

33:15.970 --> 33:18.938
it could be what I missed...

33:18.940 --> 33:22.074
in my rush to judgment.

33:27.915 --> 33:29.715
Sebastian may have something.
Go ahead.

33:29.717 --> 33:31.417
Right, well,

33:31.419 --> 33:34.019
we reexamined a cut on the back
of Janet Ortega's neck

33:34.021 --> 33:36.355
and we found microscopic slivers
of platinum

33:36.357 --> 33:38.057
imbedded in what was left
of the tissue.

33:38.059 --> 33:40.125
If the killer ripped
the necklace off her neck...

33:40.127 --> 33:42.228
Slivers might've gotten lodged
beneath the skin.

33:42.230 --> 33:43.562
That narrows
our search.

33:43.564 --> 33:45.931
Big time,
since platinum is pretty pricey.

33:45.933 --> 33:47.733
Hey, how's Doc Wade
holding up?

33:47.735 --> 33:49.502
Oh, you know.

33:49.504 --> 33:51.070
She's still beating herself up
pretty bad over all this.

33:51.072 --> 33:52.338
Can't change the past.

33:52.340 --> 33:53.572
But we can do
everything we can

33:53.574 --> 33:55.040
to make things right
moving forward.

33:55.042 --> 33:57.710
We'll get back to
you, Sebastian.

33:57.712 --> 33:59.011
Hey, I think I may have a lead.

34:00.515 --> 34:02.481
I've been runnin' the necklace
from the Ortega photo

34:02.483 --> 34:04.283
through imaging software,

34:04.285 --> 34:06.719
but I just narrowed it down
to platinum pieces only

34:06.721 --> 34:08.053
and bam!

34:08.054 --> 34:11.524
Canal Street Boutique
designed and sold

34:11.525 --> 34:13.559
the very same platinum,
diamond and amethyst necklace

34:13.561 --> 34:14.994
in 1997.

34:14.996 --> 34:16.061
If we can track down
purchase receipts,

34:16.063 --> 34:17.795
we might be able to find
a suspect

34:17.797 --> 34:21.199
who intersected
with Ortega's life 20 years ago.

34:22.168 --> 34:23.502
Can't be many.

34:23.504 --> 34:24.670
4,500 large.

34:24.672 --> 34:26.038
That's some serious change.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.572
Check this out:

34:27.574 --> 34:29.408
the store is located

34:29.409 --> 34:31.243
at the end of
the Decatur streetcar line.

34:32.480 --> 34:34.880
That's the same
street line

34:34.882 --> 34:36.849
Janet Ortega took to work
every day,

34:36.851 --> 34:38.617
with Jack Gordon
driving in the morning.

34:38.619 --> 34:41.286
And his buddy,
Todd Borger, driving at night.

34:41.289 --> 34:42.588
Could be a coincidence.

34:42.590 --> 34:43.722
but on the other hand...

34:43.724 --> 34:45.123
If we connect Borger
to her necklace,

34:45.126 --> 34:46.759
we can connect him
to her murder.

34:49.397 --> 34:51.263
Still, $4,500,

34:51.264 --> 34:53.098
pretty steep
for a young streetcar driver

34:53.100 --> 34:54.632
making, what, eight,

34:54.635 --> 34:55.967
ten bucks an hour back then?

34:55.969 --> 34:57.836
Not too steep
for a young lawyer.

34:58.673 --> 34:59.905
Jewelry store is right next to

34:59.907 --> 35:01.340
the office of Gordon's attorney.

35:01.342 --> 35:02.741
Right, Devon Mitchell.
We were there yesterday.

35:02.743 --> 35:04.410
Which means what?

35:04.412 --> 35:06.645
Mitchell's the one who
gave Ortega the necklace?

35:06.647 --> 35:08.314
Hold on, why would Mitchell
kill Janet Ortega,

35:08.316 --> 35:09.515
frame Gordon,

35:09.517 --> 35:11.116
and then turn around
and defend him?

35:11.118 --> 35:13.152
Pretty good way to make sure
Gordon loses the case.

35:13.154 --> 35:15.955
And if Mitchell
killed Chief Decker, too,

35:15.957 --> 35:18.057
make sure
it didn't get reopened.

35:19.427 --> 35:21.026
We need to find Mitchell.

35:31.405 --> 35:32.738
Sebastian!

35:32.740 --> 35:36.775
Should've just
let things be.

35:53.201 --> 35:54.411
All right, now what?

35:54.412 --> 35:57.146
Now? Now, you're gonna
delete every piece of evidence

35:57.348 --> 36:00.283
from your server.

36:00.285 --> 36:03.219
Why? You're just
gonna kill me anyway.

36:03.221 --> 36:05.721
Well, your lab tech back
there didn't see me hit him,

36:05.723 --> 36:07.924
but I can always carve
out his eyes, too.

36:07.926 --> 36:10.560
Go.

36:13.865 --> 36:16.933
Jack went to Chief
Decker for help,

36:16.935 --> 36:18.968
and she came to you, didn't she?

36:18.970 --> 36:20.870
Just delete the files.

36:20.872 --> 36:23.573
Just out of curiosity, how'd
you know I had any evidence?

36:23.575 --> 36:25.508
D.A. called me,

36:25.510 --> 36:27.577
told me you were
exhuming Janet's body.

36:27.579 --> 36:29.679
Hurry up.

36:29.681 --> 36:31.380
I forgot how chummy
you two were.

36:31.382 --> 36:32.715
Surprised you didn't talk her

36:32.717 --> 36:34.417
into the death sentence
for Jack.

36:34.419 --> 36:37.920
Yeah, well, the jury
wouldn't buy premeditation

36:37.922 --> 36:39.622
because of his condition.

36:39.624 --> 36:42.458
Otherwise, I would have.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.160
So, what,

36:44.162 --> 36:45.561
just because

36:45.563 --> 36:47.763
Janet wouldn't leave Jack
for you,

36:47.765 --> 36:50.032
you kill an innocent woman,
ruin a man's life,

36:50.034 --> 36:51.901
then kill again?

36:51.903 --> 36:54.504
Couldn't have done it
without you, Doc.

36:54.506 --> 36:57.673
Your testimony against Jack
really sealed the deal for me.

36:57.675 --> 36:59.909
Don't you dare blame
what happened to Jack on me.

36:59.911 --> 37:01.844
This is all on you.
Yeah,

37:01.846 --> 37:03.779
well, unfortunately for you,

37:03.781 --> 37:06.616
you and I are the only ones
who know that.

37:07.952 --> 37:09.352
Aren't we?

37:11.556 --> 37:12.588
Loretta?

37:32.010 --> 37:33.876
You all right?

37:33.878 --> 37:37.346
Huh? You good?

37:41.686 --> 37:43.986
You did good.

37:54.132 --> 37:56.132
<i>Please tell me</i>

37:56.134 --> 37:57.567
that getting my ass
kicked all the time

37:57.569 --> 37:59.235
is just part of the
whole newbie thing.

37:59.237 --> 38:01.304
'Cause if it's not, I
am seriously considering

38:01.306 --> 38:02.772
going back to the lab.

38:02.774 --> 38:05.208
That or just buying a
bunch of life insurance.

38:05.210 --> 38:07.743
You did great, baby,
and you're doing great.

38:07.745 --> 38:09.478
Just hang in there.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.314
That's easy for her to say.

38:11.316 --> 38:14.250
Gregorio's been knocking heads
and taking names for years.

38:14.252 --> 38:16.485
Yeah, she grew up in New York,
you know? I'm from Peoria.

38:16.487 --> 38:19.121
Here, knock 'em back, Peoria.

38:20.592 --> 38:22.892
How's Wade? Anyone talk to her
yet this morning?

38:22.894 --> 38:24.927
Pride has.
He says she's doing much better.

38:24.929 --> 38:27.029
Yeah, 'cause she's kicking ass.
Oh, stop.

38:27.031 --> 38:28.698
Not better than Lasalle.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.766
I heard Lothario's got himself
another hot date.

38:30.768 --> 38:31.734
Oh, he's not

38:31.736 --> 38:33.069
a Lothario anymore.

38:33.071 --> 38:34.604
Your boy's all grown-up.

38:34.606 --> 38:36.239
Besides, it's just breakfast.

38:36.241 --> 38:39.175
And, pray tell, how come
you know all of this?

38:39.177 --> 38:41.811
Well, you know,
been giving him a few tips.

38:41.813 --> 38:43.946
Unsolicited, maybe,
but he's listening.

38:43.948 --> 38:46.616
Ah. Handy having a profiler
on the team.

38:46.618 --> 38:49.318
Not being cocky here, but
I think I pretty much identified

38:49.320 --> 38:50.920
his perfect type.

38:50.922 --> 38:53.456
Not quite sure how
to break it to him though.

38:53.458 --> 38:54.890
Why's that?
Tough,

38:54.892 --> 38:57.426
loyal, whip-smart, sassy,

38:57.428 --> 39:00.930
can hang with the boys,
and gives as good as she gets.

39:02.734 --> 39:04.734
Percy?
Percy?

39:04.736 --> 39:08.271
Like I said, not quite sure
how to break it to him.

39:09.774 --> 39:10.806
Where you going?

39:10.808 --> 39:12.642
I'm going to get me
some pills, too.

39:12.644 --> 39:15.778
Just the thought of them
together makes my head hurt.

39:23.321 --> 39:26.989
Never got tired of driving
a streetcar through the city.

39:27.825 --> 39:29.825
It's a great job.

39:29.827 --> 39:32.228
Loved every minute of it.

39:34.966 --> 39:37.066
Might be able
to pull some strings,

39:37.068 --> 39:40.436
see if I can get you
your-your job back.

39:40.438 --> 39:43.105
You're a free man now, Jack.
Besides, the city and the state,

39:43.107 --> 39:46.809
they owe you more than that.
Still,

39:46.811 --> 39:49.779
it's a little scary being out
all of a sudden,

39:49.781 --> 39:51.547
cleared.

39:51.549 --> 39:54.116
I spent so many years
trying to prove my innocence,

39:54.118 --> 39:56.919
I didn't think much about
what I'd do if I succeeded.

39:56.921 --> 40:01.157
Well, the-the halfway house
can help you adjust.

40:01.159 --> 40:02.625
So can I.

40:02.627 --> 40:04.527
So can Dr. Wade.

40:04.529 --> 40:08.297
Is that why you wanted
to meet, ride with me?

40:08.299 --> 40:11.534
One of the reasons.

40:11.536 --> 40:13.169
Look...

40:15.473 --> 40:18.140
...you were right to...

40:18.142 --> 40:21.277
go to her for help.

40:21.279 --> 40:24.847
There's no reason
to stop now, Jack.

40:25.817 --> 40:27.917
She feels bad
about what happened,

40:27.919 --> 40:29.618
more than she deserves.

40:29.620 --> 40:33.489
Bad? Hell, didn't she just help
exonerate me?

40:34.759 --> 40:37.693
Anyway, I never held anything
against her.

40:37.695 --> 40:39.328
I mean,
she didn't do anything wrong.

40:39.330 --> 40:41.397
I... I hurt Janet.

40:41.399 --> 40:43.699
Got used against me.

40:43.701 --> 40:46.035
All she did was say it.

40:46.037 --> 40:47.636
Actually,

40:47.638 --> 40:49.939
she probably ended up
saving my life,

40:49.941 --> 40:52.975
getting the jury to take pity
on me 'cause of my condition.

40:52.977 --> 40:54.677
Then maybe you'll be open
to the other reason

40:54.679 --> 40:55.945
I wanted to talk to you.

40:55.947 --> 40:58.347
The good doctor's
donated her time

40:58.349 --> 41:01.016
to the Innocence Project
for a lot of years.

41:01.018 --> 41:04.987
Could use what you learned to
help others wrongly imprisoned.

41:04.989 --> 41:08.124
Might give you some direction.

41:08.126 --> 41:12.561
Maybe... help the two of you
heal a little bit.

41:14.265 --> 41:16.298
Interested?

41:26.377 --> 41:28.911
Storage?

41:28.913 --> 41:31.113
No. Trash.

41:31.115 --> 41:33.916
I'm not gonna let the past
weigh me down any longer.

41:33.918 --> 41:36.051
It's time to move on.

41:36.053 --> 41:39.655
