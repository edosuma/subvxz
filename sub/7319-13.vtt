WEBVTT

00:14.400 --> 00:16.467
(Meredith) NO ONE BELIEVES
THEIR LIFE

00:16.500 --> 00:19.267
WILL TURN OUT
JUST KIND OF OKAY.

00:19.300 --> 00:21.633
WE ALL THINK
WE'RE GOING TO BE GREAT.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.833
AND FROM THE DAY
WE DECIDE TO BE SURGEONS,

00:23.867 --> 00:27.433
WE ARE FILLED
WITH EXPECTATION--

00:27.467 --> 00:30.467
EXPECTATIONS
OF THE TRAILS WE WILL BLAZE,

00:30.500 --> 00:32.300
THE PEOPLE WE WILL HELP,

00:32.333 --> 00:34.133
THE DIFFERENCE WE WILL MAKE...

00:34.167 --> 00:36.567
GREAT EXPECTATIONS
OF WHO WE WILL BE,

00:36.600 --> 00:39.700
WHERE WE WILL GO.

00:39.733 --> 00:42.733
AND THEN WE GET THERE.

00:42.767 --> 00:46.067
***

00:46.100 --> 00:49.067
(rustling)

00:52.433 --> 00:54.400
(Cristina crunches her cereal)
(Preston) MEREDITH...

00:54.433 --> 00:57.600
WOULD YOU LIKE SECONDS?
I'M GREAT. MAYBE CRISTINA
WOULD LIKE SOME.

00:57.633 --> 01:00.067
CRISTINA,
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?
I ONLY MADE ENOUGH
FOR THREE.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.700
YOU JUST SAID
THERE WAS SECONDS.

01:02.733 --> 01:04.767
***

01:04.800 --> 01:06.567
THIS IS, UH, AWKWARD.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.467
YOU KNOW, WE CAN GO,
AND--AND YOU TWO CAN TALK.
OH, WE'RE TALKING.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.433
WE'RE TALKING.
TO EACH OTHER.

01:11.467 --> 01:13.567
(Derek) MEREDITH--
YOU'RE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL

01:13.600 --> 01:15.700
AT THE INTERNATIONAL HOUSE
OF SILENCE?

01:15.733 --> 01:17.767
BURKE, YOU HAVE TO
FEED CRISTINA.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.700
SHE DOESN'T COOK,
AND SHE WILL STARVE TO DEATH.
I HAVE CEREAL.

01:19.733 --> 01:21.167
YOU TWO LIVE TOGETHER.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.200
SOMEONE HAS TO BE
THE FIRST TO SPEAK.

01:23.233 --> 01:25.133
I AM GIVING A--
A DINNER PARTY.

01:25.167 --> 01:27.733
IF SHE WANTS TO SIT THERE,
SHE CAN SIT THERE.

01:27.767 --> 01:30.800
LET'S JUST ENJOY OUR EVENING
AND TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

01:30.833 --> 01:33.533
***

01:33.567 --> 01:36.433
I HEARD A CRAZY RUMOR TODAY
FROM ONE OF THE SCRUB NURSES

01:36.467 --> 01:38.700
THAT RICHARD WAS RETIRING.

01:38.733 --> 01:40.733
MM. THAT'S
AN INTERESTING RUMOR.
(scoffs)

01:40.767 --> 01:43.133
WHAT? IT'S TRUE?

01:43.167 --> 01:45.200
RICHARD'S GONNA NAME
A NEW CHIEF OF SURGERY?

01:45.233 --> 01:47.133
HE ASKED BURKE.

01:47.167 --> 01:49.067
BUT BURKE TOOK HIMSELF
OUT OF THE RUNNING,

01:49.100 --> 01:52.167
WHICH APPARENTLY IS MY FAULT
FOR BEING A PART OF THE TEAM.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.567
HE ASKED YOU?
WHO WANTS DESSERT?

01:54.600 --> 01:56.567
***

01:56.600 --> 01:58.100
IT'S SO SAD.

01:58.133 --> 02:00.500
SHE'S NOT TALKING TO HIM.
HE'S NOT TALKING TO HER.

02:00.533 --> 02:03.400
HE SAID THAT WHEN HE RETIRED,
I WOULD BECOME CHIEF.

02:03.433 --> 02:07.167
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
HE ASKS BURKE.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.333
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

02:09.367 --> 02:12.433
HE SAID TO ME, "SHEP,
YOU'RE MY MAN." NOT BURKE.

02:12.467 --> 02:14.367
HOW CAN TWO PEOPLE
BE IN A RELATIONSHIP

02:14.400 --> 02:15.733
AND NOT TALK?

02:15.767 --> 02:18.633
I AM SUPPOSED TO BE CHIEF.

02:18.667 --> 02:21.433
GEORGE, CAN I COME IN? I MADE
YOU SOME COOKIES, SOME BROWNIES,

02:21.467 --> 02:23.333
SOME MUFFINS, OF COURSE--
I ALWAYS MAKE MUFFINS.

02:23.367 --> 02:26.133
OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.
I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE.

02:26.167 --> 02:28.067
THREE TIMES ALREADY TONIGHT,

02:28.100 --> 02:30.100
AND HE'S GETTING READY
FOR A FOURTH.
ARE--ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT--

02:30.133 --> 02:31.167
OH. OH, EW.

02:31.200 --> 02:34.100
YOU KNOW, I'D GET IT IF HE
WERE CRYING OR DEPRESSED,

02:34.133 --> 02:36.067
AND I KNOW WE ALL DEAL WITH IT
DIFFERENT WAYS,

02:36.067 --> 02:37.800
BUT THIS IS NOT GRIEVING.
THIS IS MY LEGS BEING BENT

02:37.833 --> 02:39.700
IN WAYS MY LEGS DO NOT GO.

02:39.733 --> 02:42.367
AND I KNOW. I KNOW
HIS DAD DIED. I GET IT.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.567
I FEEL HORRIBLE FOR HIM.
BUT OW, OW, OKAY?

02:44.600 --> 02:46.500
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU GUYS
SOME PRIVACY.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.367
I'M GOING FAR, FAR--
(whispers) NO, YOU STAY.
YOU TAKE OVER FOR ME, OKAY?

02:49.400 --> 02:52.300
CALLIE TORRES!
NO, I DON'T--NOT LIKE THAT.
I AM GIVING HIM TO YOU.

02:52.333 --> 02:54.533
YOU ARE NOW OFFICIALLY ON
GEORGE WATCH 2007, OKAY?

02:54.567 --> 02:56.267
YOU ARE HIS FRIEND. YAY!
AND I NEED A BREAK.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.433
I NEED TO HEAL.
I NEED TO HEAL.
NO. NO.

02:58.467 --> 02:59.767
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO--
(George) CALLIE.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.500
(thump)

03:01.533 --> 03:03.467
THANK YOU. GOOD-BYE.
NO.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.600
CALLIE, WHAT IS
TAKING YOU SO...

03:08.567 --> 03:10.400
OH!

03:10.433 --> 03:13.333
UH, SHE...
SHE HAD TO GO.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.167
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

03:17.367 --> 03:18.467
HEY.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.267
OH, DR. KAREV.
HELLO.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.167
WHAT'S--
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

03:22.200 --> 03:24.100
ME? NO, I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD.

03:24.133 --> 03:25.633
I'M ALL GOOD,
ALL... GOOD.

03:25.667 --> 03:27.567
YOU'VE BEEN AVOIDING ME
FOR A WEEK.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.767
NO, I HAVE NOT.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.500
OKAY, FINE.
FORGET IT.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.367
(sighs) I KISSED KAREV.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.300
GEORGE HAS BECOME
A SEX MACHINE.

03:35.333 --> 03:36.667
HMM.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.567
GEORGE HAS TURNED
INTO A SEX MACHINE.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.500
ARE YOU HEARING ME?
A MACHINE OF SEX.

03:40.533 --> 03:43.767
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?

03:43.800 --> 03:45.667
DEREK KEPT ME UP ALL NIGHT
WITH HIS RANTING.

03:45.700 --> 03:48.500
CRISTINA AND BURKE STILL ARE NOT
SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER.

03:48.533 --> 03:49.633
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M FINE.

03:49.667 --> 03:51.700
I MEAN, I'M JUST NOT GONNA BE
THE FIRST ONE TALKING.

03:51.733 --> 03:54.400
I MEAN, HE HAS TO TALK
'CAUSE I'M IN THE RIGHT.

03:54.433 --> 03:56.200
TALKING FIRST IS FOR LOSERS.
I'M WINNING.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.300
AND ALEX--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ALEX.

03:58.333 --> 04:00.267
I'M GOOD. I'M ALL GOOD.
LET ME JUST REMIND YOU
THAT I'M STILL RECOVERING

04:00.300 --> 04:01.400
FROM THE DEATH OF MY FIANCÃ©,

04:01.433 --> 04:03.200
THE DEMISE
OF MY SURGICAL CAREER,

04:03.233 --> 04:05.367
THE FACT THAT I WAS FORCED
TO DEPOSIT AN $8-MILLION CHECK

04:05.400 --> 04:07.267
THAT I WAS SAVING FOR
A GOOD CAUSE EVEN THOUGH

04:07.300 --> 04:08.800
I HAVEN'T FOUND A GOOD CAUSE,

04:08.833 --> 04:11.567
AND I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE
UNDER CARE OF A SHRINK.
(chuckles)

04:11.600 --> 04:13.500
I COULD BLOW ANY MINUTE.
NOW GEORGE'S DAD HAS DIED.

04:13.533 --> 04:15.567
IT HAS TURNED HIM INTO
A SEX MACHINE.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.733
I'M GONNA NEED
A LITTLE HELP WITH THAT,

04:17.767 --> 04:20.333
SO ONE OF YOU
BETTER PULL IT TOGETHER.
HEY, ANYONE SEEN CALLIE?

04:20.367 --> 04:22.400
I KINDA NEED
TO FIND HER FOR SOMETHING.
LAST I HEARD,

04:22.433 --> 04:24.333
PERPETUAL SEX WAS NOT ONE OF
THE FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF.

04:24.367 --> 04:26.267
BUT DENIAL IS.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M DO--

04:26.300 --> 04:28.833
YOU SHOULDN'T BE LISTENING
AT OTHER PEOPLE'S DOORS.

04:28.867 --> 04:30.767
YOU WERE IN THE HALLWAY NAKED.
I SAW YOU.
OH, I BLOCKED THAT OUT.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.833
DENIAL. DR. MONTGOMERY.
YEAH.

04:32.867 --> 04:35.067
IS SEX ANOTHER FORM OF DENIAL?
(laughs)

04:35.100 --> 04:36.633
WHAT?

04:36.667 --> 04:38.467
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

04:38.500 --> 04:40.467
THAT...

04:40.500 --> 04:42.733
THAT YOU HAVE
A G.Y.N. PATIENT IN HERE

04:42.767 --> 04:45.300
THAT YOU WANT US TO SEE.

04:45.333 --> 04:47.300
THAT'S RIGHT.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.267
THAT'S RIGHT. I DO.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.067
SHALL WE?

04:54.767 --> 04:56.267
GOOD MORNING.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.600
(man) GOOD MORNING.
(Miranda) CHIEF!

04:57.633 --> 04:59.600
CHIEF! CHIEF.
I GOTTA TALK TO THE CHIEF.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.700
WELL, SO DO I,
AND I WAS HERE FIRST.

05:01.733 --> 05:04.600
I HAVE A MEETING TO GET TO,
A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING.
I'LL TALK QUICKLY.

05:04.633 --> 05:07.600
GET IN, TOO, SHEP,
IF YOU CAN MAKE IT FAST.
MINE'S NOT FAST. MINE IS EPIC.

05:07.633 --> 05:10.167
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO TALK LATER.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.367
(elevator bell dings)

05:11.400 --> 05:13.300
WHY ARE YOU WEARING A TIE?

05:13.333 --> 05:15.633
AND WHY ARE YOU SMILING
LIKE THAT?

05:15.667 --> 05:17.700
YOU HAVE THE LENGTH OF
THIS ELEVATOR RIDE, MIRANDA.

05:17.733 --> 05:18.800
USE IT WELL.

05:18.833 --> 05:22.500
I HAVE TWO WORDS FOR YOU,
CHIEF--FREE CLINIC.
WHAT?

05:22.533 --> 05:24.433
I WANT SEATTLE GRACE
TO OPEN A FREE CLINIC.

05:24.467 --> 05:27.333
I KNOW, IT'S
A BIG UNDERTAKING, BUT--
THIS ISN'T EVEN SURGICAL.

05:27.367 --> 05:30.333
I'VE DONE ALL THE RESEARCH.
MIRANDA, THERE'S ALL KIND
OF HOOPS TO JUMP THROUGH--

05:30.367 --> 05:34.133
FUNDING, YOU HAVE TO GET
THE DEPARTMENT HEADS TO OKAY IT.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.467
WELL, IF I GET THE SUPPORT,
WILL YOU CONSIDER THIS?

05:36.500 --> 05:39.067
(sighs)
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

05:39.067 --> 05:41.567
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY
YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS ON.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.767
YOU'RE A SURGEON.

05:42.800 --> 05:47.333
I GOTTA GET TO
MY MEETING NOW, OKAY?

05:47.367 --> 05:49.500
YOUR CHART SAYS YOU'VE BEEN
HAVING SOME PAIN AND BLEEDING?

05:49.533 --> 05:51.433
SHE HAS, FOR WEEKS.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.200
I HAD TO DRAG HER
IN HERE.

05:53.233 --> 05:55.133
ON OUR ONE DAY OFF
FROM THE RESTAURANT.

05:55.167 --> 05:56.833
JUST LET THE DOCTORS
CHECK YOU OUT.

05:56.867 --> 05:58.233
A LOT OF DOCTORS.

05:58.267 --> 06:00.133
SHE NEEDS THREE PEOPLE
FOR A PAP SMEAR?

06:00.167 --> 06:02.633
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT A PAP SMEAR.
IT'S A PELVIC EXAM.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.167
AND SINCE THIS IS
A TEACHING HOSPITAL,

06:05.200 --> 06:07.700
I WAS GOING TO HAVE
ONE OF THE INTERNS DO THE EXAM,

06:07.733 --> 06:09.633
BUT IF YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THAT...

06:09.667 --> 06:11.433
NO, IT'S FINE.

06:11.467 --> 06:13.800
I'M HELPING YOU GUYS
LEARN SOMETHING, RIGHT?

06:13.833 --> 06:16.500
OKAY, STEVENS.
OKAY. (clears throat)

06:16.533 --> 06:19.833
OKAY, JILLY, I'M JUST GONNA, UH,
WARM THE SPECULUM FOR COMFORT.

06:19.867 --> 06:22.233
SO IF YOU'LL JUST
RELAX YOUR KNEES...

06:22.267 --> 06:24.167
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY HERE
IF YOU--

06:24.200 --> 06:26.100
OF COURSE I'M STAYING.
WE DO EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

06:26.133 --> 06:27.833
WE MIGHT AS WELL DO THIS.

06:27.867 --> 06:30.067
RACHEL AND I WERE BORN
TWO DAYS APART.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.667
THAT'S NICE THAT YOUR FRIENDSHIP
HAS STAYED SO STRONG.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.067
CRADLE TO GRAVE, RIGHT?

06:35.067 --> 06:37.567
CRADLE TO GRAVE.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.533
SO JUST RELAX
THIS MUSCLE FOR ME.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.500
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
THE SPECULUM.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.133
DR. MONTGOMERY.

06:52.633 --> 06:54.600
OKAY, UH...

06:54.633 --> 06:56.500
JILLY--
WAIT.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.367
HE DIDN'T GET TO LOOK.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.167
I DON'T HAVE TO.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.333
YOU SAID THIS WAS
A TEACHING HOSPITAL.

07:05.367 --> 07:07.800
HE SHOULD LEARN.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.267
DR. O'MALLEY.

07:15.867 --> 07:19.500
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU HAVE
UP THERE?

07:19.533 --> 07:20.733
IS SHE PREGNANT?

07:20.767 --> 07:24.367
OH, MY GOD.
IF YOU'RE PREGNANT--
NO, I'M NOT PREGNANT.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.300
AM I?

07:26.333 --> 07:29.200
NO.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.167
I COULD SEE THE TUMOR.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.500
WITH MY NAKED EYE,
I COULD SEE THE TUMOR.

07:40.533 --> 07:43.500
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A CERVICAL TUMOR THAT LARGE.

07:43.533 --> 07:45.600
DOES SHE HAVE CANCER?

07:45.633 --> 07:49.100
IT-IT'LL TAKE HOURS TO GET
THE BIOPSY RESULTS BACK.

07:49.133 --> 07:51.267
IF SHE HAS CANCER,
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME,

07:51.300 --> 07:53.767
BECAUSE IF YOU TELL ME
IN FRONT OF HER,

07:53.800 --> 07:57.233
I'LL START TO CRY,
AND WHEN I CRY, SHE CRIES.

07:57.267 --> 08:00.500
IF SHE HAS FAMILY, PARENTS,
YOU SHOULD CALL THEM.

08:00.533 --> 08:01.700
YOU SHOULD CALL THEM NOW.

08:01.733 --> 08:03.500
IT'S JUST, HER PARENTS--

08:03.533 --> 08:05.367
WE... LEFT HOME.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.300
WE BOTH LEFT HOME
WHEN WE WERE 16,

08:07.333 --> 08:08.500
AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN BACK.

08:08.533 --> 08:11.667
WE DON'T... SPEAK TO THEM.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.400
IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S COMPLICATED.

08:13.433 --> 08:16.767
IT'S JUST, JILLY, UM...

08:16.800 --> 08:19.167
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THESE,
SHE MIGHT CHANGE HER MIND.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.667
SHE MIGHT WANT HER FAMILY.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.500
I AM HER FAMILY.

08:24.533 --> 08:27.400
SHE IS... MY FAMILY.

08:27.433 --> 08:30.433
I'M NOT CONTACTING
HER PARENTS,

08:30.467 --> 08:32.700
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

08:36.100 --> 08:39.067
JIM, ANNOYING INTERNS.
ANNOYING INTERNS, JIM.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.433
JIM IS SEMICOMATOSE

08:41.467 --> 08:43.800
AND HAS STAGE III
DECUBITUS ULCERS.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.533
BEDSORES?

08:45.567 --> 08:46.600
RIGHT.

08:46.633 --> 08:48.467
SO HE'S GONNA NEED
TO BE DEBRIDED,

08:48.500 --> 08:51.067
HAVE HIS DRESSINGS CHANGED

08:51.067 --> 08:53.267
AND BE REPOSITIONED
EVERY TWO HOURS.
EVERY TWO HOURS?

08:53.300 --> 08:55.533
BY THE TIME WE FINISH,
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO START AGAIN.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.433
I'M CRYING ON THE INSIDE.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.233
CAN'T THE NURSES HELP?

08:59.267 --> 09:01.567
THEY COULD,
BUT I LIKE NURSES.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.200
THEY'RE HELPFUL AND SMART

09:04.233 --> 09:06.800
AND ALREADY GOOD
AT THEIR JOBS.

09:06.833 --> 09:09.133
SO AS A GOING AWAY GIFT
TO THEM,

09:09.167 --> 09:11.067
I'M GONNA LET YOU HANG
WITH JIM

09:11.100 --> 09:13.467
WHILE I GO DO ONE LAST
RHINOPLASTY AT SEATTLE GRACE.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.467
I DO LIKE TO LEAVE A CITY
JUST A LITTLE PRETTIER

09:15.500 --> 09:17.233
THAN WHEN I CAME.

09:19.800 --> 09:24.200
DID HE JUST SAY HE WAS LEAVING,
AS IN QUITTING?

09:24.233 --> 09:25.567
(Miranda) DR. SHEPHERD.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.467
DR. BAILEY. HOW WAS
YOUR MEETING WITH THE CHIEF?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.633
UH, THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

09:29.667 --> 09:31.533
THERE'S A PROJECT I'M TRYING
TO GET OFF THE GROUND.

09:31.567 --> 09:34.533
I'D LIKE TO OPEN
A FREE CLINIC.
WHY?

09:34.567 --> 09:37.433
BECAUSE I WANT TO,
AND I COULD USE YOUR SUPPORT.

09:37.467 --> 09:39.533
AH, SEE, THAT KIND OF PROJECT
REQUIRES LOGISTICAL,

09:39.567 --> 09:41.233
STRATEGIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE
COMPONENTS,

09:41.267 --> 09:42.433
SOMETHING THE CHIEF DOES.

09:42.467 --> 09:44.667
APPARENTLY I'M NOT CUT OUT
FOR THAT KIND OF WORK.

09:44.700 --> 09:48.733
SO... YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.167
(elevator bell dings)

09:50.200 --> 09:51.400
HOW'S GEORGE?

09:51.433 --> 09:52.700
DEALING, I GUESS.

09:52.733 --> 09:54.633
OH, WELL, HE SURE HAS
A VORACIOUS APPETITE.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.567
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE BAKE,
OTHERS EAT.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.500
NO, NO, NO.
I DON'T MEAN THAT APPETITE.

09:58.533 --> 10:01.500
I MEAN THE OTHER APPETITE.
OH, OKAY.

10:01.533 --> 10:05.367
UH, WE ARE NOT FRIENDS,
YOU AND I. WE'RE NOT FRIENDS.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.200
SO PLEASE DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT WHAT GEORGE EATS.
OKAY, I WAS JUST CONCERNED,

10:08.233 --> 10:10.767
AND I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE CONCERNED. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:10.800 --> 10:13.267
FORGET IT. I DON'T LIKE YOU.
OH... (clicks tongue)
NOW MY FEELINGS ARE HURT.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.633
STEVE BECK, AGE 32,

10:14.667 --> 10:17.100
RIGHT PATELLAR DISLOCATION
SECONDARY TO A FALL

10:17.133 --> 10:18.600
WHILE RUNNING A MARATHON.

10:18.633 --> 10:20.533
THE PARAMEDICS TOLD ME
I BLACKED OUT.

10:20.567 --> 10:23.133
ANY THEORIES AS TO HOW MR. BECK
HERE COULD'VE PASSED OUT?

10:23.167 --> 10:25.533
UH, NO SIGN OF HEAD INJURY.
HIS B.P. WAS LOW IN THE FIELD.

10:25.567 --> 10:27.333
80 OVER 60.
ATHLETES HAVE LOW B.P.s.

10:27.367 --> 10:29.267
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
IT'S PROBABLY DEHYDRATION.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.200
(Steve) I DRANK A LOT
ALONG THE WAY.

10:31.233 --> 10:33.033
WHAT ELSE
DID YOU DO TODAY?

10:33.067 --> 10:34.800
ATE A COUPLE OF PROTEIN BARS,

10:34.833 --> 10:37.400
TOOK A COUPLE ASPIRIN
FOR THIS COLD I'M FIGHTING.

10:37.433 --> 10:39.633
I'VE GOT ANOTHER RACE
NEXT MONTH--OH, GOD!
(joint cracks)

10:39.667 --> 10:41.733
ALL RIGHT, PUT HIM
IN A PATELLAR BRACE,

10:41.767 --> 10:44.067
GET POSTREDUCTION FILMS
AND RUN SOME LABS.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.833
MAKE SURE
HE'S NOT TOO DEHYDRATED.

10:45.867 --> 10:47.667
AND, STEVE, NEXT TIME
YOU HAVE A COLD,

10:47.700 --> 10:50.267
YOU MIGHT WANNA SKIP
THE RACE.
NEVER.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.467
(chuckles)

10:56.233 --> 10:59.100
YOU GONNA BE OKAY WITH THIS,
WORKING ON A CANCER CASE?

10:59.133 --> 11:01.600
YEAH. WHY?
BECAUSE OF YOUR DAD.

11:01.633 --> 11:02.800
CALLIE! HEY!

11:02.833 --> 11:04.700
HI. UH, SORRY.
UH, BUSY. IZZIE.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.700
IS SHE AVOIDING ME?
WHAT ARE YOU--

11:06.733 --> 11:08.400
MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW.

11:08.433 --> 11:10.333
UM, BUT I'M HERE
IF YOU WANT TO TALK.

11:10.367 --> 11:12.233
I KNOW YOU'RE SAD.
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

11:12.267 --> 11:14.167
GEORGE, I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.467
WHY ARE YOU
MAKING THIS ABOUT YOU?
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

11:16.500 --> 11:19.100
IT'S ABOUT ME WANTING TO TALK
ABOUT YOU NEEDING SO MUCH SEX,

11:19.133 --> 11:21.233
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S VAGINA
IS BROKEN.
PURITANS.

11:21.267 --> 11:23.067
I'M NOT A PURITAN.

11:23.067 --> 11:25.800
IZZIE.
(woman) LOOK OUT!

11:34.667 --> 11:37.267
DO YOU NEED SOME HELP?

11:37.300 --> 11:39.833
(speaks Pennsylvania Dutch)

11:39.867 --> 11:41.433
(George) PARDON?

11:41.467 --> 11:43.467
OUR DAUGHTER
IS HERE SOMEWHERE.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.300
WHAT'S HER NAME?

11:45.333 --> 11:47.633
WE'LL LOOK HER UP FOR YOU.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.167
J-JILLIAN MILLER.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.100
JILLY.

11:56.433 --> 11:59.300
DON'T WORRY. IF THIS IS
REALLY SOMETHING SERIOUS,

11:59.333 --> 12:00.400
I'LL SWITCH MY SHIFTS
AT THE RESTAURANT.

12:00.433 --> 12:04.833
MAYBE DO NIGHTS
INSTEAD OF DAYS.

12:04.867 --> 12:06.500
MOM?

12:06.533 --> 12:08.067
DAD?

12:08.067 --> 12:09.600
HELLO, JILLY.

12:09.633 --> 12:12.233
WHAT ARE--WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

12:12.267 --> 12:16.100
YOU CALLED HER PARENTS?
I TOLD YOU NOT TO.
NO, I DIDN'T.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.367
IT'S OKAY, RACH.
SHE MEANT WELL.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.600
(speaking
Pennsylvania Dutch)

12:24.267 --> 12:26.167
THEY CAN'T TALK TO YOU,
REMEMBER?

12:26.200 --> 12:29.067
RIGHT. I'M SHUNNED. YOU CAN'T
GIVE AN INCH, CAN YOU?

12:29.100 --> 12:30.700
YOU AND THESE RULES.

12:30.733 --> 12:34.167
JILLY, UH, I HAVE
YOUR TEST RESULTS.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.600
I'M SORRY. YOU ARE...

12:36.633 --> 12:38.167
MY PARENTS.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.400
IT IS...
IT IS CANCER?

12:40.433 --> 12:41.700
(Addison) YES.

12:41.733 --> 12:44.800
WE'LL HAVE TO PERFORM
A RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.533
(Rachel) SURGERY?

12:46.567 --> 12:48.100
IT'S OKAY, RACH.

12:48.133 --> 12:50.833
BUT HOW DOES--
HOW DID IT GET THIS BAD?

12:50.867 --> 12:52.767
JILLY DOESN'T
WANT YOU HERE, OKAY?

12:52.800 --> 12:55.067
RACHEL, IT'S OKAY.
NO, IT'S NOT.

12:55.100 --> 12:58.200
BUT IT'S--
THEY ARE JUST HERE TO MAKE YOU
GO HOME WITH THEM.

12:58.233 --> 13:01.133
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK THERE?

13:04.433 --> 13:06.633
MOM, DAD...

13:06.667 --> 13:08.700
YOU SHOULD GO.

13:08.733 --> 13:11.100
BUT YOU'RE HAVING SURGERY.

13:11.133 --> 13:13.133
I KNOW, BUT...

13:13.167 --> 13:16.700
YOU COMING...
WAS A MISTAKE.

13:16.733 --> 13:18.733
PLEASE GO HOME.

13:18.767 --> 13:23.300
(speaks Pennsylvania Dutch)

13:29.067 --> 13:30.467
YOU'RE QUITTING?

13:30.500 --> 13:32.400
AS SOON AS I FIND THE CHIEF

13:32.433 --> 13:35.067
AND HAND HIM
MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION.
WHY?

13:35.067 --> 13:36.833
I HATE IT HERE.
I HATE THE TOWN.

13:36.867 --> 13:39.133
I HATE THE WEATHER.
I HATE THE PEOPLE.

13:39.167 --> 13:41.700
THEY'RE MEAN.
THEY'RE UNFORGIVING.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.067
UH-HUH. THE PEOPLE
OF SEATTLE ARE UNFORGIVING,

13:44.100 --> 13:46.067
OR DEREK AND ADDISON?

13:46.100 --> 13:47.600
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

13:47.633 --> 13:50.067
(chuckles)
WHAT ABOUT YOUR CONTRACT?

13:50.100 --> 13:52.400
MY NONBINDING
VERBAL AGREEMENT WITH RICHARD?

13:52.433 --> 13:54.567
YEAH, I'M BREAKING THAT.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.167
WELL, IT'S NOT AS IF HE'S
GONNA BE AROUND TO ENFORCE IT,

13:58.200 --> 13:59.367
SO...

13:59.400 --> 14:01.067
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:01.100 --> 14:02.833
WELL, THE RUMOR HAS IT
HE'S STEPPING DOWN.

14:02.867 --> 14:04.767
THE CHIEF?
MM-HMM.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.300
WELL, WHO'S GONNA TAKE
HIS PLACE?

14:07.333 --> 14:10.433
WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU'RE LEAVING ANYWAY.

14:10.467 --> 14:13.400
WHEN RICHARD ASKED YOU
TO COME OUT HERE,

14:13.433 --> 14:15.333
WHAT DID HE USE FOR BAIT?

14:15.367 --> 14:17.667
HE TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE
THE FOREMOST NEONATAL UNIT

14:17.700 --> 14:19.200
WEST OF MANHATTAN.

14:19.233 --> 14:22.567
OKAY. HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT BEING CHIEF.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.500
WHY? WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
NOTHING.

14:25.533 --> 14:27.067
I KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.367
YOU'RE LYING.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.567
DR. MONTGOMERY.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.633
UH, I'M BUSY NOW, KAREV.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.100
(raises voice)
WHEN YOU GET A MINUTE,

14:36.133 --> 14:38.300
I'D LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT THE KISSING.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.700
(bangs charts)

14:43.100 --> 14:44.267
WHO'D YOU PISS OFF?
(Meredith) SLOAN.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.300
OH, NICE.
YOU GOT ANYTHING GOOD?

14:46.333 --> 14:48.333
NOT EVEN A FRACTURE.

14:48.367 --> 14:49.800
YOU THINK A GUY

14:49.833 --> 14:52.700
PASSES OUT WHILE RUNNING,
I'D AT LEAST GET A FRACTURE.

14:52.733 --> 14:57.467
ANYONE AVAILABLE TO ASSIST ME
ON A TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS SURGERY?

14:57.500 --> 14:58.767
(Alex) YEAH.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.300
(Meredith) YES, ABSOLUTELY.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.233
GOOD, THEN THE FIRST ONE
OF YOU

15:02.267 --> 15:05.700
TO ACCURATELY DESCRIBE
THE CONDITION WILL SCRUB IN.

15:05.733 --> 15:07.233
NO ONE KNOWS THE ANSWER?

15:09.200 --> 15:11.733
(chuckles) THAT'S TOO BAD.

15:11.767 --> 15:15.367
IT'LL PROBABLY BE YEARS BEFORE
WE SEE ANOTHER ONE LIKE THIS.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.800
OH, WELL.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.500
IT'S A SINGLE ARTERIAL TRUNK
COMING FROM THE VENTRICLES.

15:19.533 --> 15:22.800
HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW THAT?
HOW COULD YOU NOT SAY IT?

15:25.300 --> 15:27.267
(sighs)

15:29.367 --> 15:31.267
I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO FIND OUT

15:31.300 --> 15:33.167
ABOUT THAT CHIEF THING
THAT WAY.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.433
YOU MEAN AFTER THE FACT?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.300
NOT THE FIRST TIME.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.567
I COULDN'T GO TO ANYBODY
ABOUT MY HAND.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.100
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO I COULD TRUST.

15:41.133 --> 15:43.067
I WAS STUCK.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.700
YEAH.

15:44.733 --> 15:47.267
WELL, NOW YOU'RE NOT.

15:47.300 --> 15:49.200
HAND'S ALL BETTER.
YOU CAN OPERATE.

15:49.233 --> 15:51.133
YOU CAN EVEN RUN FOR CHIEF.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.333
LIFE IS ALL GOOD AGAIN.

15:52.367 --> 15:54.533
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA TRY
FOR CHIEF.

15:54.567 --> 15:58.400
I'M LOOKING FOR... ANSWERS.

15:58.433 --> 16:00.333
WELL, THE CHIEF ASKED YOU
ONCE ALREADY.

16:00.367 --> 16:03.500
I DON'T SEE WHY HE WOULDN'T
ASK YOU AGAIN.

16:03.533 --> 16:06.400
LOOK, I COULDN'T TAKE THE JOB.
IT WOULDN'T BE...

16:06.433 --> 16:08.067
IT WOULDN'T BE... RIGHT.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.367
WELL, WHETHER SOMETHING'S
RIGHT OR NOT

16:10.400 --> 16:13.667
DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER
MUCH IN THIS PLACE.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.400
(door opens and closes)

16:16.433 --> 16:19.133
WELL, YOUR LABS SHOW THAT
YOU'RE SIGNIFICANTLY DEHYDRATED

16:19.167 --> 16:20.667
AND YOUR MUSCLES
ARE BREAKING DOWN A BIT.

16:20.700 --> 16:22.600
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THE FLUIDS HELP GET

16:22.633 --> 16:25.167
EVERYTHING BACK TO NORMAL
BEFORE WE SEND YOU HOME.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.100
BUT MY KNEE'S GONNA BE
OKAY, RIGHT?

16:27.133 --> 16:29.500
'CAUSE I BLEW THIS RACE.
I GOTTA WIN THE NEXT ONE.
YOUR X-RAY LOOKS FINE.

16:29.533 --> 16:32.067
YOUR KNEE SHOULD BE OKAY
IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.567
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY
SOME P.T.
IT'S PRETTY SORE.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.500
THE KNEE?
YEAH, MY CALVES, TOO.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.067
OH. UH, WELL, MAYBE--

16:38.067 --> 16:40.533
YOUR BRACE IS PROBABLY
A LITTLE TOO TIGHT.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.733
YOU'VE GOT EXTREME SWELLING
IN BOTH LEGS. GET TORRES, NOW.

16:46.867 --> 16:49.067
(Steve grunting)
(Callie)
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

16:49.100 --> 16:51.433
HE WAS COMPLAINING
OF LEG PAIN.

16:51.467 --> 16:53.600
(Steve) PLEASE, CAN'T YOU
MAKE IT STOP?!
I CAN'T FIND A PULSE.

16:53.633 --> 16:55.500
ALL RIGHT,
OPEN A CUTDOWN TRAY. GLOVES.

16:55.533 --> 16:58.267
OKAY, LISTEN, I NEED YOU TO DO
EVERYTHING THAT I DO

16:58.300 --> 17:00.133
EXACTLY AS I DO IT, ALL RIGHT?

17:00.167 --> 17:02.467
STEVE, LISTEN TO ME,
THIS IS GONNA HURT.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.700
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO KEEP YOUR LEGS,

17:03.733 --> 17:07.233
I NEED YOU TO HOLD THEM STILL.
ALL RIGHT? CAN YOU DO THAT?

17:07.267 --> 17:10.533
OKAY, HOLD HIS LEGS.
ALL RIGHT.

17:10.567 --> 17:11.633
OKAY...

17:11.667 --> 17:14.167
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.267
(Steve) AAH!

17:17.300 --> 17:19.567
AAH! AAH!

17:23.833 --> 17:25.767
HIS KIDNEYS ARE FAILING.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.800
WHY IN THE HELL IS THIS
PROGRESSING SO RAPIDLY?
OH, DAMN IT.

17:28.833 --> 17:30.733
(Cristina) WHAT?
THE ASPIRIN.

17:30.767 --> 17:32.733
BECAUSE OF THE MARATHON
AND THE DEHYDRATION,

17:32.767 --> 17:34.300
HIS MUSCLES ARE BREAKING DOWN,

17:34.333 --> 17:35.533
AND THE ASPIRIN'S
ACCELERATING THE PROCESS.

17:35.567 --> 17:37.233
HIS WHOLE SYSTEM'S CRASHING.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.300
THE TOXINS IN HIS BODY
ARE GOING TO KILL HIM.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.333
I NEED TO PUT IN A DIALYSIS
CATHETER UNDER FLUORO.

17:41.367 --> 17:43.233
LET'S GET THIS MAN
TO AN O.R. NOW, PEOPLE.

17:43.267 --> 17:45.167
YOU WANT TO GO GRAB LUNCH?

17:45.200 --> 17:47.100
OH, YEAH, UM...
I WAS ACTUALLY HOPING

17:47.133 --> 17:49.067
I COULD
GRAB LUNCH WITH CALLIE.

17:49.067 --> 17:50.400
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?
NO, BUT--

17:50.433 --> 17:52.333
I THINK
I'M GONNA PAGE HER.

17:52.367 --> 17:53.667
GEORGE.
IZZIE.

17:53.700 --> 17:56.500
LOOK.
THEY'RE STILL HERE.

17:56.533 --> 17:59.400
THEY'RE HER FAMILY.
WHERE ELSE ARE THEY GONNA GO?

17:59.433 --> 18:02.467
ACTUALLY,
I'M GONNA FIND CALLIE.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.100
(sighs)

18:08.633 --> 18:09.833
DR. MONTGOMERY.

18:09.867 --> 18:11.533
NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME.
KAREV!

18:11.567 --> 18:13.067
KAREV, LISTEN TO ME--

18:13.100 --> 18:14.433
NO, YOU LISTEN.

18:14.467 --> 18:16.367
YOU KISSED ME, RIGHT?
YOU KISSED ME,

18:16.400 --> 18:19.267
AND EVER SINCE,
YOU'VE BEEN AVOIDING ME.
ALEX--

18:19.300 --> 18:21.067
NO, YOU HAVE BEEN AVOIDING ME

18:21.067 --> 18:22.800
BECAUSE YOU JUST ASSUME
THAT I WANT YOU.

18:22.833 --> 18:24.733
YOU JUST EXPECT THAT EVERYONE
YOU LOOK AT SIDEWAYS

18:24.767 --> 18:25.967
IS PINING AFTER YOU, RIGHT?

18:26.067 --> 18:28.300
HAS IT EVEN OCCURRED TO YOU
THAT MAYBE I'M NOT INTERESTED?

18:28.333 --> 18:29.800
YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED?

18:29.833 --> 18:32.067
YOU THINK I WANT TO BE
JUST ANOTHER INTERN

18:32.100 --> 18:33.700
SLEEPING WITH AN ATTENDING?

18:33.733 --> 18:36.067
YOU KISSED ME BACK.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.400
(chuckles) YOU'RE MY BOSS.

18:37.433 --> 18:40.300
I MEAN,
WHAT'D YOU EXPECT ME TO DO?

18:40.333 --> 18:43.200
LOOK, SLOAN'S HAD ME
CHANGING BANDAGES ALL DAY,

18:43.233 --> 18:45.133
AND I WOULD WAY RATHER
BE SCRUBBING IN

18:45.167 --> 18:46.333
ON ONE OF YOUR SURGERIES,

18:46.367 --> 18:50.267
AND IF YOU KEEP AVOIDING ME,
THEN I DON'T GET TO SCRUB IN.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.633
SO STOP AVOIDING ME.

18:51.667 --> 18:56.167
IT HAPPENED. BUT IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.700
ALL RIGHT.

18:57.733 --> 18:59.467
ALL RIGHT.

19:02.500 --> 19:05.367
RUMOR HAS IT YOU'RE HEADED
BACK TO NEW YORK.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.567
WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

19:06.600 --> 19:08.300
GOOD NEWS TRAVELS FAST.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.233
ACTUALLY, I WAS GONNA
ASK YOU TO SCRUB IN

19:10.267 --> 19:11.433
ON A PERIPHERAL
NERVE RECONSTRUCTION,

19:11.467 --> 19:14.333
BUT SINCE IT'S YOUR LAST DAY--
IT ISN'T, AND I'D LOVE TO.

19:14.367 --> 19:16.067
WHAT? BUT I THOUGHT--

19:16.067 --> 19:17.767
WELL, I WAS GOING,
BUT NOW I'M NOT.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.700
RUMOR HAS IT
THERE'S A RACE FOR CHIEF.

19:19.733 --> 19:21.067
WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

19:21.100 --> 19:22.600
GOOD NEWS TRAVELS FAST.
(chuckles)

19:22.633 --> 19:24.533
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE
A CHATTY GIRLFRIEND.

19:24.567 --> 19:26.767
ANYWAY, SEE YOU
AT THE FINISH LINE.

19:28.367 --> 19:30.067
HAVE YOU DONE THAT BEFORE?

19:30.100 --> 19:33.333
SLICE A GUY'S LEGS OPEN
WHILE HE'S AWAKE? NO.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.367
IMPRESSIVE.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.733
YOU, TOO.

19:36.767 --> 19:39.800
NOT THAT WE'RE, UH,
FRIENDS OR ANYTHING.

19:42.867 --> 19:45.833
SO YOU SAID I SHOULD BE
CONCERNED... ABOUT GEORGE.

19:45.867 --> 19:49.733
HE DOESN'T--HE DOESN'T
TALK ABOUT HIS DAD.

19:49.767 --> 19:52.333
WE DON'T--WE DON'T TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING, REALLY.

19:52.367 --> 19:54.367
HE JUST--
TALKING'S OVERRATED.

19:54.400 --> 19:58.200
OH, SO YOU AND BURKE
STILL AREN'T, UH...

19:58.233 --> 20:00.567
GEORGE TOLD ME.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.267
WELL, SEE,
YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.167
YEAH, A WEEK AGO.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.033
IF THIS KEEPS UP,
YOU AND BURKE MIGHT BE

20:07.067 --> 20:08.800
THE VERY LAST THING
WE EVER TALK ABOUT.

20:08.833 --> 20:13.200
SO WHAT'S THE LAST THING
YOU AND BURKE TALKED ABOUT?

20:15.133 --> 20:16.600
SILENCE IS OVERRATED.

20:19.367 --> 20:21.033
(Izzie) WHERE'S RACHEL?

20:21.067 --> 20:22.800
SHE WENT TO GO MAKE
SOME PHONE CALLS,

20:22.833 --> 20:25.467
TRY TO GET HER SHIFTS COVERED.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.533
YOU KNOW, JILLY, UM...

20:27.567 --> 20:29.567
YOUR PARENTS ARE STILL HERE.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.667
THEY ARE?

20:31.700 --> 20:34.200
AND I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO CALLED THEM.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.233
YEAH. (sighs)

20:37.267 --> 20:40.167
YOU CALLED THEM, RIGHT?

20:40.200 --> 20:43.067
AND I'M GUESSING THEY HAD TO
FLY IN FROM SOMEWHERE.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.067
SO... YOU CALLED THEM,
WHAT, YESTERDAY,

20:46.100 --> 20:48.100
THE DAY BEFORE?

20:48.133 --> 20:51.367
I WENT TO AN E.R.
A WHILE AGO.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.233
AND THEY TOLD ME TO SEE
AN ONCOLOGIST.

20:54.267 --> 20:56.367
BUT... I COULDN'T AFFORD
MY RENT,

20:56.400 --> 20:59.133
LET ALONE PAY
A BUNCH OF MEDICAL BILLS.

20:59.167 --> 21:02.467
BUT... THEN I GOT SCARED.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.667
YOU CALLED YOUR PARENTS.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.167
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.233
YOU SENT THEM AWAY BECAUSE...

21:10.267 --> 21:11.733
RACHEL'S MY BEST FRIEND.

21:11.767 --> 21:14.067
AND AFTER SHE WAS BAPTIZED,

21:14.067 --> 21:16.367
SHE DECIDED TO LEAVE
THE COMMUNITY,

21:16.400 --> 21:18.733
WHICH MEANS SHE'S SHUNNED.

21:18.767 --> 21:20.667
BUT...
I COULDN'T JUST LET HER

21:20.700 --> 21:22.600
GO OUT IN THE WORLD
ALL BY HERSELF.

21:22.633 --> 21:24.833
SO YOU'RE SHUNNED, TOO?

21:24.867 --> 21:27.067
NO, BECAUSE I HADN'T
BEEN BAPTIZED YET.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.767
SO I COULD STILL GO BACK.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.300
BUT RACHEL WOULD NEVER--

21:31.333 --> 21:34.133
DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK?

21:34.167 --> 21:36.600
I THINK ABOUT IT.

21:38.133 --> 21:39.800
IT'S MY HOME, YOU KNOW?

21:39.833 --> 21:42.800
AND IF I'M DYING...

21:44.433 --> 21:47.300
I WANT AN AMISH FUNERAL.

21:47.333 --> 21:50.267
I WANT TO BE BURIED
IN THE WHITE DRESS,

21:50.300 --> 21:53.767
AND I WANT EVERYBODY
TO BE THERE.

21:53.800 --> 21:57.467
IT'S YOUR HOME.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.367
BUT...

21:59.400 --> 22:01.833
I MADE A PROMISE TO RACHEL.

22:01.867 --> 22:04.667
CRADLE TO GRAVE.

22:11.533 --> 22:14.333
(Izzie) HOW DID JILLY LET IT
GET THIS FAR?

22:14.367 --> 22:17.100
IT'S FRUSTRATING, ISN'T IT?
AND IT'S ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE.

22:17.133 --> 22:19.533
AND TREATABLE,
IF YOU CATCH IT IN TIME,

22:19.567 --> 22:21.700
BUT YOU GOTTA CATCH IT.

22:21.733 --> 22:24.067
WHICH IS WHY I WANT TO OPEN
A CLINIC.

22:24.067 --> 22:26.367
IF SHE HAD HAD ACCESS
TO A FREE CLINIC,

22:26.400 --> 22:29.333
SHE PROBABLY WOULD'VE HAD
A PAP SMEAR EVERY YEAR

22:29.367 --> 22:31.267
AND WOULDN'T BE DEALING
WITH INFERTILITY

22:31.300 --> 22:34.467
AND PREMATURE MENOPAUSE
AT THE TENDER AGE OF 23.

22:34.500 --> 22:37.133
(George) YOU WANT TO OPEN
A FREE CLINIC?

22:37.167 --> 22:38.700
AT SEATTLE GRACE? WHY?

22:38.733 --> 22:41.200
ILLNESS CAUGHT EARLY MEANS
FEWER UNNECESSARY SURGERIES,

22:41.233 --> 22:43.433
FEWER UNNECESSARY DEATHS.

22:43.467 --> 22:45.133
BUT I MEAN, WHY?

22:45.167 --> 22:46.467
BECAUSE.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.800
AND IF I CAN GET THE SUPPORT
THAT I'M LOOKING FOR--

22:48.833 --> 22:50.733
I NEED SUCTION.

22:50.767 --> 22:52.200
(sighs)

22:52.233 --> 22:54.300
OH, NO.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.600
MY GOD.

22:55.633 --> 22:59.100
WHAT?
THE TUMOR'S INVADED

22:59.133 --> 23:01.167
THROUGH THE CERVIX
AND INTO THE BLADDER.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.167
WHICH MEANS
SHE IS A STAGE IV.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.667
WELL, WE'RE NOT DOING
THIS OPERATION TODAY.

23:04.700 --> 23:06.567
WE'VE GOT TO CLOSE HER UP.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.633
(Miranda) THERE'S NOTHING MORE
WE CAN DO HERE.

23:11.533 --> 23:13.600
(Addison) O'MALLEY?

23:13.633 --> 23:15.733
HIS DAD.

23:23.133 --> 23:26.067
***

23:37.500 --> 23:40.567
HOW FAR'D HE RUN BEFORE HIS BODY
HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO PASS OUT?

23:40.600 --> 23:42.367
12 MILES.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.233
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

23:44.267 --> 23:46.100
WELL, HE COULDN'T
HAVE EXPECTED A HEAD COLD

23:46.133 --> 23:48.267
AND A COUPLE OF ASPIRIN
TO DO HIM IN.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.233
HE PROBABLY FELT DIZZY
MILES BEFORE HE PASSED OUT.

23:50.267 --> 23:51.700
HE SHOULD'VE STOPPED,
SAT HIS ASS DOWN.

23:51.733 --> 23:54.433
HE WAS IN IT TO WIN.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.567
YOU CAN, CAN YOU?
WELL, SURGERY IS THE MOST
COMPETITIVE FIELD IN MEDICINE.

23:56.600 --> 24:00.333
WE'RE ALL HERE TO WIN.
IT'S A LONG ROAD, DR. YANG,
WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF IT,

24:00.367 --> 24:03.100
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CARE
ABOUT WINNING.

24:03.133 --> 24:05.533
YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE RELIEVED
YOU MADE IT TO THE FINISH LINE.

24:05.567 --> 24:07.300
YOU TOLD SLOAN?

24:07.333 --> 24:09.767
WHAT?
MARK SLOAN.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.633
YOU TOLD HIM THE CHIEF
WAS STEPPING DOWN,

24:11.667 --> 24:13.567
THAT I WANTED THE JOB.
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS A SECRET.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.133
HE WAS LEAVING, MEREDITH.
HE WAS LEAVING TOWN.
OKAY, AND NOW HE'S NOT?

24:16.167 --> 24:18.700
NO, HE'S NOT.
YOU GAVE HIM A REASON TO STAY.

24:18.733 --> 24:19.667
(door slams)

24:19.700 --> 24:22.200
DEREK.

24:22.233 --> 24:24.400
THE COMMITMENT I'M ASKING FOR
IS ONLY A FEW HOURS A WEEK.

24:24.433 --> 24:28.233
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T DEAL WITH
ANY MORE DISTRACTIONS RIGHT NOW.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.767
YOU OWE ME.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.367
WHAT?
WHEN YOU HAD THAT TREMOR,

24:32.400 --> 24:34.333
YOU CUT ME OUT OF SURGERY
AFTER SURGERY,

24:34.367 --> 24:37.767
MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS THE ONE
WHO COULDN'T DO HER JOB.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.133
YOU MADE ME DOUBT MYSELF.

24:40.167 --> 24:42.567
YOU OWE ME THIS.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.500
***

24:44.533 --> 24:46.567
YOU NEED SOMEONE WHO CAN
PROVIDE LEADERSHIP,

24:46.600 --> 24:48.400
DIRECTION TO THE PROJECT.

24:48.433 --> 24:51.200
I'M NOT THAT MAN.

24:51.233 --> 24:53.233
NOT ANYMORE.

24:53.267 --> 24:56.133
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO BELIEVE.

24:56.167 --> 24:59.067
***

24:59.100 --> 25:01.167
(Izzie)
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS,

25:01.200 --> 25:02.800
JILLY'S GONNA
GO THROUGH A LOT--

25:02.833 --> 25:04.733
RADIATION, CHEMO.

25:04.767 --> 25:08.600
IT'S LIKELY HER...
CONDITION WILL GET WORSE,

25:08.633 --> 25:10.467
A LOT WORSE,

25:10.500 --> 25:13.367
AND SHE'S GONNA NEED
A LOT OF HELP.
OKAY.

25:13.400 --> 25:16.133
UM, WELL, CAN YOU
GIVE ME SOME NAMES

25:16.167 --> 25:18.167
OF--OF DOCTORS
AND MEDICATIONS?

25:18.200 --> 25:19.367
'CAUSE I WANNA BE READY.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.800
I WANNA KNOW EVERYTHING
SO I CAN DO THIS--

25:21.833 --> 25:23.467
DO THIS RIGHT FOR HER.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.667
RACHEL...

25:25.700 --> 25:29.500
YOU CAN'T... BE EVERYTHING.

25:29.533 --> 25:30.700
IT'S TOO HARD.

25:30.733 --> 25:32.500
JILLY HAS PARENTS
WHO LOVE HER.

25:32.533 --> 25:34.500
THEY--THEY LOVE HER,

25:34.533 --> 25:36.300
AND THEY'RE HERE,
AND SHE WANTS TO GO HOME.

25:36.333 --> 25:37.833
NO, SHE DOESN'T.

25:37.867 --> 25:40.233
SHE CALLED THEM, NOT ME.

25:40.267 --> 25:42.233
JILLY CALLED?

25:42.267 --> 25:44.100
JILLY IS DYING.

25:44.133 --> 25:46.600
BUT I PROMISED HER.

25:46.633 --> 25:48.133
CRADLE TO GRAVE.

25:48.167 --> 25:50.800
SHE'S JILLY. I LOVE HER.

25:50.833 --> 25:53.233
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
THE VERY BEST THING

25:53.267 --> 25:56.133
THAT YOU CAN DO FOR HER
IF YOU LOVE HER

25:56.167 --> 25:57.467
IS LET HER GO.

26:11.667 --> 26:13.667
ARE YOU WAITING
TO SEE THE CHIEF?

26:13.700 --> 26:15.767
YES. YOU?

26:15.800 --> 26:17.767
YEAH.

26:17.800 --> 26:20.100
ABOUT?

26:20.133 --> 26:22.300
UH, OH, YOU KNOW, JUST,
UH, ADMIN STUFF. YEAH.

26:22.333 --> 26:24.267
YEAH, ME, TOO.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.833
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

26:25.867 --> 26:28.833
WE'RE WAITING
TO SEE THE CHIEF.
YOU, TOO?

26:28.867 --> 26:30.733
YES, DEREK, BOTH OF US.

26:30.767 --> 26:32.533
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.
I'M UNBELIEVABLE?
THE CHIEF STEPS DOWN,

26:32.567 --> 26:35.133
AND YOU AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME
IT'S BETWEEN YOU AND BURKE?

26:35.167 --> 26:37.433
YOU THINK HE'S GONNA PICK YOU?
WELL, I THINK THE FACT

26:37.467 --> 26:39.300
THAT HE HASN'T TAPPED
EITHER ONE OF YOU YET

26:39.333 --> 26:41.233
MEANS THAT HE HAS
ANOTHER CANDIDATE IN MIND.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.667
WHAT, NO ONE INVITED ME
TO THE PARTY?

26:42.700 --> 26:44.333
(Derek) CHIEF.
(Addison) I HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT, CHIEF.

26:44.367 --> 26:46.467
ABOUT THAT
NEO-LEFT VENTRICLE--
I TALKED TO PATRICIA.

26:46.500 --> 26:49.133
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND
TIME WITH YOU ALL DAY...
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

26:49.167 --> 26:50.800
(Derek, Preston and Addison
all talking at once)

26:50.833 --> 26:52.667
STOP, STOP, STOP.
ONE AT A TIME HERE.

26:52.700 --> 26:55.200
YOU...
WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT?

26:55.233 --> 26:57.133
OH, THEY ALL WANT TO BE CHIEF.

26:57.167 --> 26:59.333
AND FOR THE RECORD,
SO DO I.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.500
(Derek) OH, YOU WANT TO BE CHIEF
JUST BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE.
(Preston) OH, PLEASE.

27:01.533 --> 27:04.400
THAT'S ABSURD.
ALL RIGHT, BUTTON IT.
ALL OF YOU.

27:04.433 --> 27:06.300
I HAVE HAD A PERFECT DAY.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.233
I WENT TO THE BOARD
THIS MORNING

27:08.267 --> 27:10.233
AND TOLD THEM
I WAS RETIRING,

27:10.267 --> 27:11.767
I SAVED A LIFE,

27:11.800 --> 27:14.100
AND NOW I AM OFF
TO SEE MY WIFE.

27:14.133 --> 27:17.067
IT HAS BEEN A PERFECT DAY
UNTIL YOU FOUR FOOLS

27:17.100 --> 27:18.767
TRIED TO RUIN IT.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.100
A MAN CAN'T BE HAPPY
HE'S RETIRING AROUND HERE,

27:21.133 --> 27:23.600
NOT WITH YOU VULTURES
TRYING TO PICK MY BONES.

27:23.633 --> 27:26.800
CHIEF...
YOU STEPPIN' DOWN?

27:28.567 --> 27:31.833
AS SOON AS THEY FIND
A REPLACEMENT FOR ME,

27:31.867 --> 27:34.167
I'M STEPPING DOWN
AS CHIEF OF SURGERY.

27:36.300 --> 27:38.233
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHEN
THAT'LL BE,

27:38.267 --> 27:41.733
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT,
I DON'T SEE ANY FRONT-RUNNERS.

27:41.767 --> 27:43.667
EXCUSE ME.
(Addison)
CHIEF, THAT'S NOT TRUE--

27:43.700 --> 27:45.600
(Derek)
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.
(Richard) EXCUSE ME.

27:45.633 --> 27:47.800
(Preston, Derek, Addison
and Mark all talking at once)

27:51.633 --> 27:52.333
YOU DIDN'T THINK

27:52.367 --> 27:55.067
OF MAYBE TELLING ME
THIS MORNING

27:55.100 --> 27:56.833
THAT YOU WERE PLANNING
TO STEP DOWN

27:56.867 --> 27:59.067
INSTEAD OF SENDING ME
ON THIS WILD GOOSE CHASE?

27:59.100 --> 28:00.833
DR. BAILEY,
YOU NEED THOSE CLOWNS

28:00.867 --> 28:03.667
TO SIGN OFF ON YOUR PROPOSAL
BECAUSE ONE OF THEM

28:03.700 --> 28:05.500
MAY BE CHIEF OF SURGERY
IN A MONTH.

28:05.533 --> 28:07.433
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE,
FOR ME MORE THAN ANYONE,

28:07.467 --> 28:09.533
BUT SINCE YOU'RE NOT READY
FOR THE JOB,

28:09.567 --> 28:12.500
ONE OF THEM'S GONNA HAVE TO
DO IT FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

28:12.533 --> 28:15.167
ME?
IT'S YOU IN THE CHAIR
EVENTUALLY.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.533
THAT'S WHO YOU ARE.

28:16.567 --> 28:18.267
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET A NEW CHAIR

28:18.300 --> 28:19.767
BECAUSE YOU'RE SHORT.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.233
YOU HAVE SHORT LEGS.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.433
BUT SOMEDAY YOU ARE
GONNA BE CHIEF OF SURGERY.

28:23.467 --> 28:26.100
I WASN'T SENDING YOU
ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE.

28:26.133 --> 28:28.267
I WAS TRYING TO GET YOU
IN THE HABIT

28:28.300 --> 28:30.067
OF DOING THINGS WITHOUT ME.

28:37.500 --> 28:38.667
(sighs)
HE'S REALLY DOING IT.

28:38.700 --> 28:39.700
MM.

28:39.733 --> 28:41.500
HE'S REALLY RETIRING.

28:41.533 --> 28:44.267
ONE OF US COULD BE CHIEF.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.333
NO.

28:46.367 --> 28:48.333
ONE OF US COULD BE CHIEF.

28:48.367 --> 28:50.067
YOU? I DON'T THINK SO.

28:50.067 --> 28:51.233
YEAH.
YEAH.

28:51.267 --> 28:52.767
OH, I COULD BE CHIEF.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.133
YOU'RE DELUSIONAL.

28:54.167 --> 28:55.633
MARK SLOAN,
CHIEF OF SURGERY.

28:55.667 --> 28:58.667
THAT MAKES ME VOMIT
A LITTLE IN MY MOUTH.

28:58.700 --> 28:59.467
(Preston laughs)

28:59.500 --> 29:02.433
THESE ARE YOUR LETTERS
OF SUPPORT

29:02.467 --> 29:04.200
FOR MY FREE CLINIC.

29:04.233 --> 29:07.133
SIGN THEM.
WHY DO YOU WANT
THIS CLINIC SO BADLY?

29:07.167 --> 29:10.167
YOU'RE A SURGEON.
BECAUSE I NEED SOMETHING MORE.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.700
I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE YOUR
MESSY LOVE LIVES

29:12.733 --> 29:15.167
AND YOUR SECRETS
AND YOUR SILLINESS,

29:15.200 --> 29:16.700
BUT I WANT MORE.

29:16.733 --> 29:18.633
I NEED SOMETHING
TO HOLD ON TO.

29:18.667 --> 29:21.367
I NEED A REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT MEDICINE CAN DO MORE

29:21.400 --> 29:23.367
THAN STITCH YOU UP
AND--AND SEND YOU AWAY.

29:23.400 --> 29:26.267
I NEED TO BELIEVE THAT MEDICINE
CAN NOT ONLY SAVE LIVES,

29:26.300 --> 29:27.467
BUT--BUT CHANGE LIVES.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.533
I NEED TO--I NEED...

29:31.367 --> 29:33.267
I NEED TO BELIEVE IN SOMETHING

29:33.300 --> 29:36.167
THE WAY I USED TO BELIEVE
IN YOU ALL.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.467
SIGN THE PAPERS.

29:44.167 --> 29:45.700
SIGN THE PAPERS.

29:45.733 --> 29:47.500
YOU STILL NEED FUNDING.

30:00.100 --> 30:02.667
THE NAZI'S BACK.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.700
HI.

30:11.467 --> 30:13.600
GO HOME.

30:13.633 --> 30:15.533
RACH...

30:15.567 --> 30:17.300
THEY'RE YOUR PARENTS,

30:17.333 --> 30:20.033
AND YOU LOVE THEM,
AND THEY'RE STILL HERE.

30:20.067 --> 30:21.800
YOU KNOW
WHAT A BIG DEAL IT IS

30:21.833 --> 30:23.733
FOR THEM TO GET ON A PLANE.

30:23.767 --> 30:25.533
GO HOME, JILLY.

30:25.567 --> 30:27.533
BUT...

30:27.567 --> 30:30.533
I CAN'T
JUST LEAVE YOU HERE.

30:30.567 --> 30:31.800
YES, YOU CAN.

30:31.833 --> 30:33.367
RACHEL--

30:33.400 --> 30:34.567
YOU CAN GO BACK HOME.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.700
AND YOU CAN
PUT ON YOUR BONNET,

30:36.733 --> 30:39.567
AND YOU CAN GET IN THE BUGGY
AND GO TO CHURCH,

30:39.600 --> 30:42.067
GET BAPTIZED.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.267
YOU CAN DIE AMISH.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.767
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.733
WHY, 'CAUSE YOU'LL
HAVE TO SHUN ME?

30:46.767 --> 30:48.667
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

30:48.700 --> 30:50.833
I WILL BE LIVING IT UP HERE
WITH YOUR CURLING IRON

30:50.867 --> 30:52.633
AND YOUR CABLE TV

30:52.667 --> 30:55.433
AND YOUR ENTIRE
DVD COLLECTION.

30:55.467 --> 30:59.633
I'LL BE OKAY
HERE IN THE 21st CENTURY.

31:01.600 --> 31:04.233
I CAN'T SHUN YOU.

31:04.267 --> 31:06.133
YOU CAN.
AND YOU WILL.

31:06.167 --> 31:09.300
AND I WON'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

31:12.767 --> 31:16.500
(both sobbing)

31:18.367 --> 31:20.433
NOW SAY HELLO
TO YOUR PARENTS.

31:20.467 --> 31:22.533
(sniffles)

31:22.567 --> 31:24.267
HI.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.467
(Jilly sobs)

31:26.500 --> 31:28.133
(woman) JILLY.

31:28.167 --> 31:29.400
HI.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.100
JILLY.

31:33.133 --> 31:35.700
DAD.

31:39.700 --> 31:43.400
I WILL TELL YOUR PARENTS
THAT I SAW YOU,

31:43.433 --> 31:45.333
AND YOU ARE WELL AND HAPPY

31:45.367 --> 31:49.200
AND HAVE GROWN
INTO A FINE WOMAN.

32:06.767 --> 32:08.433
AH.

32:08.467 --> 32:10.167
RICHARD.

32:10.200 --> 32:12.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:12.333 --> 32:14.100
THESE ARE FOR YOU?

32:14.133 --> 32:17.067
RICHARD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:17.067 --> 32:19.067
I DID IT, ADELE.

32:19.067 --> 32:20.733
I RETIRED.

32:20.767 --> 32:24.100
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU, I DIDN'T
THINK I WANTED TO DO IT,

32:24.133 --> 32:26.533
BUT... I'M RELIEVED.

32:26.567 --> 32:28.233
(chuckles) I'M HAPPY.

32:28.267 --> 32:29.600
BUT WHEN I TOLD YOU

32:29.633 --> 32:31.533
I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY MORE TIME TO WAIT,

32:31.567 --> 32:33.400
I MEANT IT.

32:33.433 --> 32:35.467
I KNOW YOU DID,
WHICH IS WHY--
THAT WAS MONTHS AGO.

32:35.500 --> 32:38.333
MONTHS AGO, I SAID,
"YOU ARE OUT OF TIME WITH ME."

32:38.367 --> 32:40.433
ADELE...

32:49.633 --> 32:51.567
IS THERE A MAN IN MY HOUSE?

32:53.500 --> 32:56.233
I'M SO SORRY, RICHARD.

32:57.867 --> 33:01.700
BUT WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

33:01.733 --> 33:03.267
(sighs)

33:17.400 --> 33:20.167
I'M SORRY.

33:22.167 --> 33:25.067
WHY... I'M ANGRY.

33:25.067 --> 33:26.800
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HAVING
A LOT OF SEX

33:26.833 --> 33:28.733
IF IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER?

33:28.767 --> 33:33.133
DO YOU... FEEL BETTER?

33:33.167 --> 33:36.467
YOU KNOW HOW YOU FELT...

33:39.267 --> 33:42.300
WHEN YOU WERE LYING
ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR?

33:46.133 --> 33:50.167
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO FEEL BETTER.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.100
IZ, YOU CAN'T HELP ME.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.733
I KNOW YOU WANT TO.

33:57.767 --> 34:00.733
BUT YOU CAN'T.

34:00.767 --> 34:04.200
YOU CAN'T HELP ME.

34:04.233 --> 34:06.400
I HAVE TO LET YOU GO.

34:08.067 --> 34:09.433
YEAH.

34:09.467 --> 34:12.400
JUST ONE LAST THING.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.433
LIFE IS SHORT, GEORGE.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.300
LIFE IS SHORT,

34:26.333 --> 34:29.300
AND IT SUCKS
A LOT OF THE TIME.

34:30.867 --> 34:33.067
IF BEING WITH CALLIE
MAKES YOU HAPPY,

34:33.067 --> 34:36.067
THEN GO BE WITH CALLIE.

34:55.500 --> 34:58.200
HEY, HE GONNA BE OKAY?

34:58.233 --> 34:59.767
I THINK SO.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.100
HOW'S YOUR CLINIC GOING?

35:04.133 --> 35:06.367
I GOT MY SIGNATURES,

35:06.400 --> 35:08.600
WHICH IS A START.

35:08.633 --> 35:12.533
THE SEATTLE GRACE
FREE CLINIC WILL EXIST.

35:17.133 --> 35:21.067
THE DENNY DUQUETTE
MEMORIAL CLINIC.

35:21.100 --> 35:22.767
WHAT?

35:22.800 --> 35:25.800
I HAVE $8 MILLION.

35:25.833 --> 35:29.333
IZZIE STEVENS...

35:36.133 --> 35:37.467
YOU LEFT WITHOUT ME.

35:40.233 --> 35:43.067
OH, NOW YOU'RE NOT
TALKING TO ME.

35:43.067 --> 35:45.067
(Derek sighs)

35:46.800 --> 35:49.700
I WAS A JERK.

35:49.733 --> 35:51.333
SOMETIMES BOYFRIENDS
CAN BE JERKS.

35:51.367 --> 35:53.767
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU STOP TALKING TO THEM.

35:55.500 --> 35:59.067
YOU GET THAT I'M SAYING
"I'M SORRY," RIGHT?

35:59.067 --> 36:01.133
YOU YELLED AT ME
FOR NO REASON,

36:01.167 --> 36:03.733
AND THEN YOU WALKED AWAY,
AND NOW YOU SHOW UP HERE.

36:03.767 --> 36:05.700
OF COURSE I SHOWED UP.

36:05.733 --> 36:08.200
WHY WOULDN'T I?
YOU DON'T TRUST ME?

36:08.233 --> 36:10.633
I DO.
OKAY, WELL, THIS IS
HOW IT WORKS--

36:10.667 --> 36:13.400
YOU FIGHT SOMETIMES,
AND SOMEBODY APOLOGIZES.

36:13.433 --> 36:15.567
WELL, HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?

36:15.600 --> 36:18.467
YOU'VE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE.

36:18.500 --> 36:21.367
NO, I'VE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.067
HMM.

36:24.267 --> 36:26.233
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

36:26.267 --> 36:29.433
WELL, THIS IS...
(sighs)

36:30.800 --> 36:32.533
FROM NOW ON,

36:32.567 --> 36:36.700
YOU CAN EXPECT
THAT I'M GONNA SHOW UP,

36:36.733 --> 36:38.667
EVEN IF I YELL,

36:38.700 --> 36:40.500
EVEN IF YOU YELL.

36:42.467 --> 36:45.367
I'M ALWAYS GONNA SHOW UP.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.233
OKAY?

36:47.267 --> 36:50.067
OKAY.

36:50.067 --> 36:52.800
***

36:59.567 --> 37:03.467
YOU ARE GONNA MAKE
AN EXCELLENT CHIEF.

37:03.500 --> 37:06.367
WE ALL THINK
WE'RE GOING TO BE GREAT.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.233
YEAH.

37:08.267 --> 37:10.433
AND WE FEEL
A LITTLE BIT ROBBED

37:10.467 --> 37:13.067
WHEN OUR EXPECTATIONS
AREN'T MET.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.267
KAREV, I'VE GOT
AN OVARIAN TORSION

37:15.300 --> 37:17.667
THAT NEEDS EMERGENT SURGERY.

37:17.700 --> 37:19.067
YOU WANT IN?

37:19.067 --> 37:20.633
YEAH.

37:20.667 --> 37:22.333
BUT SOMETIMES,

37:22.367 --> 37:24.767
OUR EXPECTATIONS
SELL US SHORT.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.700
***

37:26.733 --> 37:30.167
I WAS RIGHT.

37:30.200 --> 37:35.233
I SWEAR, I REALLY BELIEVE
WHAT I DID WAS RIGHT.

37:35.267 --> 37:38.133
I-I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FORGIVE ME.

37:38.167 --> 37:40.500
FRANKLY, I'D... (sighs)

37:40.533 --> 37:42.433
I'D FIND IT PATRONIZING
IF YOU DID,

37:42.467 --> 37:45.400
BECAUSE...
WHILE I KNOW I WAS RIGHT,

37:45.433 --> 37:47.633
YOU THINK I'M WRONG...

37:49.200 --> 37:51.367
WHICH DOESN'T MATTER.

37:51.400 --> 37:54.267
***

37:54.300 --> 37:56.300
BECAUSE...

37:58.233 --> 38:00.300
I'M IN THIS.

38:02.833 --> 38:05.800
I'M IN THIS
FOR THE LONG HAUL,

38:05.833 --> 38:08.800
AND I'M IN THIS
TO FINISH THE RACE.

38:08.833 --> 38:12.733
SO IF THAT MEANS
I DON'T WIN THIS ONE,

38:12.767 --> 38:15.067
THEN FINE.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.167
I DON'T WIN.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.500
YOU WIN.

38:18.533 --> 38:21.767
I'M TALKING.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.200
SEE? I'M TALKING FIRST.
YOU WIN.

38:25.233 --> 38:28.733
SOMETIMES THE EXPECTED
SIMPLY PALES

38:28.767 --> 38:32.067
IN COMPARISON
TO THE UNEXPECTED.

38:32.100 --> 38:33.800
***

38:33.833 --> 38:35.533
MARRY ME.

38:39.367 --> 38:41.233
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE
ANOTHER MINUTE.

38:41.267 --> 38:43.300
I CAN'T HAVE SEX
WITH YOU AGAIN, GEORGE.

38:43.333 --> 38:47.100
OKAY? I CAN'T. I JUST--
I--ENOUGH WITH THE SEX.

38:47.133 --> 38:48.833
***

38:48.867 --> 38:51.633
SINCE MY DAD DIED,
I FEEL LIKE, UH...

38:51.667 --> 38:53.800
SOMEONE RIPPED OUT
MY STOMACH,

38:53.833 --> 38:56.367
FILLED THE HOLE
WITH ASPHALT.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.467
AND I LAUGH EVERY TIME
THAT I REMEMBER

38:58.500 --> 39:01.067
I'M NEVER GONNA
TALK TO HIM AGAIN

39:01.100 --> 39:02.267
BECAUSE IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE

39:02.300 --> 39:05.500
THE STUPIDEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

39:05.533 --> 39:07.767
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S REAL.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.167
BUT...

39:10.200 --> 39:12.800
EVERY TIME I LOOK AT YOU...

39:12.833 --> 39:16.433
I FEEL BETTER.

39:16.467 --> 39:18.567
IT SHOCKS ME.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.733
IT KNOCKS MY WIND OUT,
BUT IT'S TRUE.

39:20.767 --> 39:23.433
AND I DON'T HAVE TO
HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

39:23.467 --> 39:26.333
I'M HAPPY JUST TO LOOK
AT YOU FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.

39:26.367 --> 39:29.200
AND EVEN THAT--
ANYTHING, ANY PIECE OF YOU...

39:29.233 --> 39:31.267
I MEAN,
HOPEFULLY ALL OF YOU.

39:31.300 --> 39:33.100
THAT'D BE THE BEST THING...

39:33.133 --> 39:35.767
***

39:35.800 --> 39:37.733
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

39:37.767 --> 39:40.067
GEORGE...

39:40.100 --> 39:44.167
***

39:49.500 --> 39:52.100
MARRY ME.

39:52.133 --> 39:55.200
***

39:55.233 --> 39:59.633
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

39:59.667 --> 40:03.267
MARRY ME, CRISTINA YANG.

40:03.300 --> 40:07.400
YOU GOTTA WONDER WHY
WE CLING TO OUR EXPECTATIONS

40:07.433 --> 40:13.433
BECAUSE THE EXPECTED
IS JUST WHAT KEEPS US STEADY,

40:13.467 --> 40:16.700
STANDING... STILL.

40:16.733 --> 40:19.133
MARRY ME.

40:19.167 --> 40:22.167
THE EXPECTED'S
JUST THE BEGINNING.

40:22.200 --> 40:26.500
***

40:26.533 --> 40:29.300
THE UNEXPECTED...

40:31.600 --> 40:34.367
IS WHAT CHANGES OUR LIVES.
