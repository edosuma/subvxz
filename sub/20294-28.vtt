01:01.167 --> 01:02.733
FOCUSING ON GANGS AND GUNS.

01:02.833 --> 01:05.333
-WE'RE GONNA FLIP AROUND

01:05.433 --> 01:06.700

02:12.833 --> 02:16.067
OH, CORRECTION:

02:35.333 --> 02:37.367
-HE MIGHT HAVE GONE TO
THE BACK OF THE BUSINESS.

02:37.467 --> 02:39.967
-HE WAS BETWEEN WALGREENS
AND ORCHARD.

02:42.167 --> 02:43.700
-NO, HE'S NOT.

-WHERE'S THE BIKE AT?

03:25.100 --> 03:26.800
-I DON'T KNOW. HE CAME
WALKING OUT FROM OVER HERE.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.933
-WHAT ARE YOU GUYS

03:29.067 --> 03:31.167
-52, WE'VE GOT
ONE DETAINED.

03:32.567 --> 03:34.567
-HE CRASHED THE BIKE IN HERE.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.633
IGNITION'S PUNCHED.

03:37.733 --> 03:40.067
IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY LICENSE PLATES ON IT.

03:40.133 --> 03:42.433
THEY WERE PROBABLY GONNA
PUT ANOTHER PLATE FROM
ANOTHER BIKE ON IT

03:42.533 --> 03:44.700
THAT'S NOT STOLEN EVENTUALLY,
BUT HE DIDN'T GET TO THAT.

03:47.567 --> 03:48.867
-WHAT'S YOUR NAME, MAN?

03:48.967 --> 03:50.733

04:01.933 --> 04:03.733
-BUT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
-OKAY.

04:03.833 --> 04:06.267
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED, OR YOU WANT ME
TO JUST GO THROUGH THE PROCESS?

04:06.367 --> 04:07.933
-I'M TRYING TO ASK YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

04:08.067 --> 04:10.067
I JUST CAME OUT OF
ORCHARD SUPPLY AND YOU GUYS
JUST RAN AND JUMPED ME.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.433
-CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

04:12.533 --> 04:15.733
THERE'S CITY CAMERAS, OKAY?

GONNA READ YOU THIS, OKAY?

04:21.867 --> 04:24.067
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.
ANYTHING YOU SAY

04:24.100 --> 04:25.633
CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU
IN A COURT OF LAW.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.067
YOU CAN HAVE A--

04:27.167 --> 04:28.667
-OFFICER, I UNDERSTAND
MY RIGHTS.

04:28.767 --> 04:30.533
BUT I WAS NOT
ON A MOTORCYCLE.

04:30.633 --> 04:32.433
-WELL, YOU MATCH
THE EXACT DESCRIPTION.

04:32.533 --> 04:35.067
YOU CAME FROM THE SAME LOCATION,
OUR CITY CAMERA SAW YOU.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.633
-DUDE, THAT'S NOT--
-I SAW YOU ON THE BIKE.

04:36.733 --> 04:38.267
-OFFICER--
-I SAW YOU ON THE BIKE.

04:38.367 --> 04:39.933
-THAT'S NOT ME
THAT YOU GUYS SEEN.

04:40.067 --> 04:41.633
-IT IS. IT IS.
-NO, IT'S NOT.

04:41.733 --> 04:43.333
-WHY ARE YOU RUNNING?

04:43.433 --> 04:45.800
-I'M NOT RUNNING FROM YOU GUYS.
THAT'S NOT ME IS WHAT
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.233
-OKAY.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.267
ALL RIGHT, THE BIKE'S STOLEN.

04:49.367 --> 04:51.600
YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW THAT.
-WHAT BIKE ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

04:51.700 --> 04:53.200
-THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
YOU'RE RUNNING.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.900
-MM-KAY?
-I'M NOT RUNNING.
I WASN'T ON NO BIKE.

04:56.067 --> 04:57.400
-OKAY.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.467
IT WAS A GOOD THING YOU DIDN'T
HIT ANOTHER CAR

04:59.567 --> 05:01.467
'CAUSE WE WOULDN'T BE
HAVING THIS DISCUSSION
RIGHT NOW.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.067
-I'M GONNA LOOK AT YOU
STRAIGHT IN THE EYE

05:03.100 --> 05:05.167
AND TELL YOU I THAT WAS
NOT ON NO MOTORCYCLE.
THAT WAS NOT ME.

05:05.267 --> 05:06.233
-OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

05:06.333 --> 05:07.900
-SO WHAT AM I
BEING CHARGED WITH?

05:08.067 --> 05:09.900
-STOLEN BIKE, AND I BELIEVE
YOU HAVE A WARRANT.

05:10.067 --> 05:12.133
-SEVERAL, I THINK.
-OKAY? AND THEN FLEEING
FROM THE POLICE.

05:12.233 --> 05:14.600
FELONY EVADING.
-BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

05:14.700 --> 05:16.500
-OKAY.
-I UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE
THE WARRANT.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.133
I KNOW ABOUT THAT.
-OKAY.

05:18.233 --> 05:20.367
-BUT A STOLEN BIKE IS NOT ME.

05:20.467 --> 05:22.067
-OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.567
WATCH YOUR LEG.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.533
-(shouting hysterically)

05:25.633 --> 05:27.167
-MA, COME ON.

05:27.267 --> 05:29.333

QUIT, MA.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.267
-(continues shouting
hysterically)

05:33.367 --> 05:34.667
-MA, QUIT!

05:34.767 --> 05:37.067
-HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
TAKE HER AWAY.

05:37.133 --> 05:39.067
-(chattering)

05:39.100 --> 05:41.433
-IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
I CAN TALK TO YOU
OVER HERE.

05:41.533 --> 05:42.567
-COME OVER HERE, COME OVER HERE.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.067
-WHAT?

05:44.167 --> 05:45.967
-IT'S ALL RIGHT.
-I'LL MAKE SOMETHING
HAPPEN, BRO. I PROMISE.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.633
I'LL MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN,
DON'T WORRY.

05:47.733 --> 05:49.067
-YEAH!
-MA, CALM DOWN.

05:49.167 --> 05:50.600
-HEY, HEY.
GO OVER THERE.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.600
HE WAS IN A PURSUIT, OKAY?

05:52.700 --> 05:54.233
COME HERE AND I'LL TALK TO YOU.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.300
IF YOU GUYS WOULD BE CALM,
I'LL BE HAPPY TO EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.900
-I WAS JUST TRYING
TO CALM HER DOWN.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.200
-HE WAS ON A STOLEN MOTORCYCLE,
HE'S GOT A WARRANT.
HE'S GOING TO JAIL.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.067
OKAY, AND HE FLED FROM US.

06:02.167 --> 06:03.467
-OKAY?
-ALL RIGHT.

06:03.567 --> 06:04.833
-SO...

06:04.933 --> 06:06.433
HE ALREADY KNEW ABOUT
THE WARRANT, HE WAS TRYING

06:06.533 --> 06:08.067
TO SAY ALL THIS OTHER STUFF
WASN'T HIM.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.867
BUT WE KNOW IT WAS,
WE SAW HIM ON THE BIKE.

06:09.967 --> 06:13.300
OKAY? BOTTOM LINE IS HE TRIED
TO DITCH THE BIKE AND RUN AWAY,

06:13.400 --> 06:15.067
SO...

06:15.100 --> 06:16.500
ALL RIGHT?

06:16.600 --> 06:18.667
LUCKILY HE DIDN'T HIT
ANOTHER CAR OR SOMEBODY ELSE.

06:18.767 --> 06:20.833
(clears throat)

06:20.933 --> 06:22.667
ALL RIGHT, BRANDON.

06:22.767 --> 06:25.233
I'M JUST GONNA GO OVER
YOUR CHARGES SO YOU UNDERSTAND,
OKAY?

06:25.333 --> 06:28.400
YOU HAVE FOUR WARRANTS
FOR YOUR ARREST, ONE OF THEM
BEING A NO-BAIL,

06:28.500 --> 06:29.700
OKAY?

06:29.800 --> 06:31.100
-ONE QUESTION, REAL QUICK.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.500
-HOLD ON. LET ME JUST
GO OVER THIS...

06:32.600 --> 06:33.633
-I DON'T WANNA FORGET,
THAT'S ALL.

06:33.733 --> 06:35.067
-...THEN I'LL LET YOU
ASK ME, OKAY?

06:35.100 --> 06:37.067
FELONY EVADING FROM
WHEN YOU RAN FROM US.

06:37.167 --> 06:38.267
OKAY?

06:38.367 --> 06:40.533
UM, SOME TRAFFIC CHARGES
FOR RUNNING RED LIGHTS.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.267
THINGS LIKE THAT,
NO LICENSE PLATES.

06:42.367 --> 06:44.467
YOU'RE SUSPENDED, YOU DON'T HAVE
A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

06:44.567 --> 06:46.733
OKAY? YOU SHOULDN'T BE EVEN
DRIVING A CAR OR RIDING
A MOTORCYCLE.

06:46.833 --> 06:49.067
AND THEN, UH... THE STOLEN BIKE.

06:49.133 --> 06:50.267
OKAY?

06:50.367 --> 06:51.800
-CAN I JUST SAY BYE TO THEM?

06:52.967 --> 06:54.633
-YOU CAN SAY BYE
FROM HERE REAL QUICK.

06:54.733 --> 06:56.667
-THAT'S IT?
-YEAH. JUST YELL OUT.

06:56.767 --> 06:58.500
-DOLL!

06:58.600 --> 07:00.967
DOLL, I'M GONNA
CALL YOU, 'KAY?

07:01.067 --> 07:03.467
-HUH?
-I'M GONNA CALL YOU
FROM BOOKING!

07:03.567 --> 07:05.433
-OKAY.
-MAKE SURE YOU ANSWER!

07:05.533 --> 07:07.233
-ALL RIGHT.

07:07.333 --> 07:10.067
GOOD JOB BY THE CITY CAMERAS
KEEPING HIM IN SIGHT SO WE COULD
FIND HIM OVER HERE.

07:12.567 --> 07:15.067
-I'VE BEEN AN ATLANTA
POLICE OFFICER FOR JUST OVER
A YEAR NOW.

07:15.167 --> 07:16.267
YOU GET TO DO A LOT MORE

07:16.367 --> 07:19.167
THAN JUST, YOU KNOW,
LOCK PEOPLE UP

07:19.267 --> 07:20.867
AND KIND OF GET IN
THE CRAZY SITUATIONS.

07:20.967 --> 07:22.400
YOU ACTUALLY GET
TO TOUCH PEOPLE.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.167
YOU GET TO AFFECT PEOPLE'S
LIVES IN A POSITIVE MANNER

07:25.267 --> 07:26.967
AND NOT JUST A NEGATIVE ONE,

07:27.067 --> 07:28.933
SO YOU GET TO REALLY SEE

07:29.067 --> 07:31.267
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF LIFE
THAT YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT

07:31.367 --> 07:32.867
YOU'D BE ABLE TO SEE
IN THIS CAREER FIELD.

07:32.967 --> 07:35.567
-WE GOT A SUSPICIOUS MALE
UP HERE AT THE TOP.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.467
WOODLINE.

07:37.567 --> 07:41.133
IT'S A HEAVILY DRUG AREA

07:41.233 --> 07:43.267
SO I'M GONNA GET OUT

07:48.533 --> 07:49.933
-I DON'T KNOW.

07:51.067 --> 07:53.067

07:56.200 --> 07:58.367
GET DOWN! DOWN!

07:58.467 --> 07:59.833
WHAT YOU RUNNING FOR, MAN?

08:00.067 --> 08:01.867
-I DON'T KNOW. I'M TRYING TO SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

08:01.967 --> 08:03.400
-OKAY. YOU'RE TRYING
TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:03.500 --> 08:05.400
STAY WHERE YOU'RE AT.
TURN AROUND, MAN.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.233
-SEEN A WHOLE BUNCH OF POLICE.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.367
WHY YOU RUNNING?

08:10.467 --> 08:12.600
-I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
I WAS DRINKING MY LIQUOR, MAN.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.167
-ARE YOU DRINKING?

08:14.267 --> 08:16.467
-OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA
DETAIN YOU REAL QUICK.
GIVE ME 54 STYLE UP.

08:17.467 --> 08:18.467
-13-12.

08:18.567 --> 08:20.067
-FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN YOU
BEFORE, MAN.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.200
-HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.133
-YEAH, MAN, WHAT YOU--
WHY YOU RUNNING?

08:30.233 --> 08:31.433
WHY YOU HANGING

08:31.533 --> 08:33.700
-WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
-I WAS TAKING A PEE.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.067
HOLD ON.

08:35.167 --> 08:36.267
-THAT'S GOOD.
DON'T REACH FOR NOW.

08:36.367 --> 08:37.667
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
DON'T REACH FOR THAT.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.100
-I'M GONNA GET MY WALLET,
THAT'S ALL.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.700
-OKAY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

08:40.800 --> 08:41.900
-RYMON.

08:42.067 --> 08:43.567
-WHAT IS IT?
-RYMON.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.367
-SPELL IT.
-R-Y-M-O-N.

08:45.467 --> 08:46.667
-R-Y-M-O-N?

08:46.767 --> 08:48.100
-YES, SIR.
-OKAY.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.767
-SO, WHAT-- WHAT--

08:49.867 --> 08:51.833
WHAT EXACTLY WERE YOU DOING
ON TOP OF THE HILL AGAIN?

08:51.933 --> 08:53.533
SAID YOU WERE DRINKING
YOUR BEER?

08:53.633 --> 08:55.967
-(mumbles)
-OKAY. WHERE YOUR
CUP OF LIQUOR AT?

08:56.067 --> 08:57.967
-IT'S UP THERE
SOMEWHERE... (mumbles)

08:58.067 --> 09:00.167
-OKAY. THAT'S THE ONLY
THING YOU WAS UP THERE DOING?

09:01.367 --> 09:02.933
-THAT'S THE ONLY THING
I WAS UP THERE DOING.

09:03.067 --> 09:04.167
-OKAY.

09:04.267 --> 09:05.933
ALL RIGHT, SO IF WE GO
UP THERE, TOP OF THE HILL,

09:06.067 --> 09:07.367
DO A QUICK SEARCH,

09:07.467 --> 09:09.967
THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE'RE
GONNA LOCATE IS A CUP OF LIQUOR?

09:10.067 --> 09:11.833
-I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA LOCATE.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.167
-I JUST WALKED UP THERE.
-OH.

09:13.267 --> 09:14.733
-YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GONNA LOCATE?

09:14.833 --> 09:16.267
-MAN, GET UP, MAN.

09:16.367 --> 09:17.733
STAND UP FOR ME.

09:17.833 --> 09:19.567
-YOU LOOK LIKE... BREAK
YOUR DAMN ANKLE.

09:19.667 --> 09:20.867
-YEAH.

09:20.967 --> 09:23.267
-I SEE. I KNOW I SOUND
DRUNK, MAN.

09:23.367 --> 09:24.767
-DRUNK?
-YOU AIN'T DRUNK.

09:24.867 --> 09:26.533
I KNOW YOU AIN'T DRUNK.
YOU DON'T EVEN LOOK DRUNK.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.300
I DON'T SMELL LIQUOR
ON YOUR BREATH OR NOTHING.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.900
-(mumbles)
-OKAY.

09:30.067 --> 09:32.733
-WHY WOULD YOU DO ALL THAT
AND MESS UP THEM NICE NEW J'S?

09:32.833 --> 09:34.400
-BRAND NEW.
-BRAND NEW!

09:34.500 --> 09:36.067
AND YOU STEPPED IN
SOME DIRT AND SOME KUDZU.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.500
-HOW MUCH YOU GOT
IN YOUR BACK POCKET?

09:37.600 --> 09:39.067
-UM... (inhales sharply)

09:39.100 --> 09:41.433
PROBABLY 200-SOMETHING DOLLARS.
-PROBABLY 200?

09:42.500 --> 09:44.067
-WHAT'S IT FOR?

09:44.167 --> 09:46.067
-A LITTLE, UM, BILL MONEY
I HAD ON ME.

09:46.133 --> 09:47.767
-BEER MONEY?
-BILL MONEY.

09:47.867 --> 09:49.267
BILL MONEY, OKAY.

09:49.367 --> 09:51.133
WHAT KIND OF WORK YOU DO?

09:51.233 --> 09:52.800
LITTLE LANDSCAPING.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.067
-LITTLE LANDSCAPING?

09:54.100 --> 09:57.067
SOME WEIRD DENOMINATIONS
FOR BILL MONEY.

09:58.367 --> 10:00.433
-IT'S GONNA BE KIND OF TOUGH,
MAN, TO LOCATE ANYTHING.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.100
-WE GOT A DOG COMING.

10:05.267 --> 10:07.067
(sighs) SOMETHING'S GOTTA
BE UP HERE, MAN.

10:07.167 --> 10:08.967
YOU JUST DON'T RUN LIKE THAT
FOR NO REASON.

10:09.067 --> 10:13.000
IT MIGHT BE SOMEWHERE
BACK THIS WAY WHERE HE RAN.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.633
-GOOD BOY! GOOD BOY!

10:23.733 --> 10:25.933
OKAY. (cooing)

10:27.100 --> 10:28.700
SEE THAT 69 RIGHT HERE?

10:30.900 --> 10:32.700
AND THE DOPE RIGHT THERE.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.233
-WHAT IS THAT?

10:35.333 --> 10:36.433
-DOPE AND A GUN.
-YEP.

10:36.533 --> 10:37.933
-YEP, THERE IT IS.
-THERE IT IS.

10:38.033 --> 10:39.167
-(police radio beeps)

10:39.267 --> 10:40.733
-(chattering)

10:40.833 --> 10:43.400
IT'S A HIGH DRUG AREA AROUND
THIS LITTLE CORRIDOR HERE.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.767
YOU SEE A LOT OF GUYS.

10:45.867 --> 10:48.167
AND WHEN THEY SEE US ROLL BY,
THEY'LL DITCH IT,

10:48.267 --> 10:49.900
THROW IT IN A PLACE WHERE
THEY THINK WE WON'T LOOK,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.633
AND, UH... WE ENDED UP
FINDING IT SOMEWHERE
IN THE BUSHES.

10:53.733 --> 10:55.133
WE'LL SEE.

10:57.533 --> 11:00.200
SEVERAL HITS OF, IT LOOKS LIKE
CRACK COCAINE.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.300
LOOKS LIKE WE ALSO GOT
SOME... WEAPONRY.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.067
SMALL GLOCK PISTOL.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.267
UH...

11:09.367 --> 11:11.133
AN EXTENDED MAGAZINE.

11:11.233 --> 11:13.700
FOR THAT GLOCK PISTOL.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.867
-WE GOT THE EMT'S HERE.
COME ON, STEP ON OUT

11:15.967 --> 11:17.833
SO THEY CAN TALK TO YOU.

11:20.233 --> 11:22.200
-MAN, HELL NO, MAN.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.567
COME ON.
-SO THAT'S NOT YOURS?

11:23.667 --> 11:26.333
-MAN, SHE SEEN ME WALKING
FROM THE LIQUOR STORE EARLIER!

11:26.433 --> 11:27.633
-MAN, CALM DOWN.

11:27.733 --> 11:29.867
-AIN'T NO WAY IN HELL I HAD
ALL THAT ON ME, MAN!

11:29.967 --> 11:32.233
COME ON WITH
THE (bleep) MAN!

11:32.333 --> 11:33.967
-LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

11:34.067 --> 11:36.167
-I'M RIGHT HERE
IN THE HOTEL, MAN.

11:36.267 --> 11:37.833
-OKAY, SO WHAT WERE
YOU DOING UP THERE
IN THE HILL?

11:37.933 --> 11:39.733
-I WAS TAKING A PISS!
MY CUP RIGHT THERE!

11:39.833 --> 11:41.100
I TOLD Y'ALL THAT (bleep) MAN!

11:41.200 --> 11:42.833
-WHY WOULD GO UP THERE
ON TOP OF THE HILL AND TAKE--

11:42.933 --> 11:44.300
-(stammering)

11:44.400 --> 11:46.167
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL
FOR TAKING NO DAMN PISS.

11:46.267 --> 11:49.267
-SO WE WERE ABLE TO RECOVER
APPROXIMATELY 80 HITS,

11:49.367 --> 11:51.067
CRACK COCAINE.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.767
EACH ONE OF THESE BAGGIES GOES
FOR ABOUT FIVE OR TEN DOLLARS
ON THE STREET.

11:53.867 --> 11:59.500
IT'S THE TYPE THING THAT YOU'D
NORMALLY FIND ON THESE
LOWER TO MIDLEVEL DOPE DEALERS.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.633
JUST SORT OF LIKE
THE NORM OUT HERE.

12:02.733 --> 12:06.100
EXPLAIN TO ME, JUST WHAT
ARE YOU DOING UP THERE
ON THAT HILL?

12:06.200 --> 12:08.433
IF YOU'RE JUST UP THERE
USING THE BATHROOM,

12:08.533 --> 12:10.100
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING?
WHAT IS THERE TO RUN FOR?

12:10.200 --> 12:12.100
-BRO, 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU
TO COME UP THE HILL

12:12.200 --> 12:13.733
AND LOCK ME UP FOR PISSING.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.433
-REALLY?
-DRINKING IN PUBLIC.

12:15.533 --> 12:16.967
-REALLY?

12:17.067 --> 12:18.733
I SEE FOLKS GO UP THAT HILL
ALL THE TIME, BRO.

12:18.833 --> 12:20.733
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE
MY QUICK PEE,

12:20.833 --> 12:23.400
COME ON BACK DOWN THE HILL,
GO ON TO THE STORE, MAN.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.833
-SO YOU'RE GONNA GO OVER INTO
THE DIRTY BUSHES WITH
ALL THAT KUDZU, RIGHT?

12:26.933 --> 12:28.533
WALK UP THAT DIRT HILL--

12:28.633 --> 12:30.467
-I KNOW THAT STORE
AIN'T GOT NO BATHROOM.

12:30.567 --> 12:32.400
-YOU GOT ON WHITE AND BLACK
SNEAKERS AND YOU'RE TELLING ME

12:32.500 --> 12:33.800
YOU'RE GONNA WALK UP
THERE IN THE DIRT?

12:33.900 --> 12:35.367
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT GOES
ON IN THIS AREA, RIGHT?

12:35.467 --> 12:37.467
-I KNOW WHAT GOES ON HERE.
-A LOT OF DOPE SELLING,

12:37.567 --> 12:39.233
A LOT OF DOPE BUYING, RIGHT?

12:39.333 --> 12:40.667
-(mumbling)
-LISTEN TO WHAT I'M SAYING.

12:40.767 --> 12:42.533
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WAS
GOING ON, RIGHT?

12:42.633 --> 12:43.800
-(chattering)
-OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

12:43.900 --> 12:46.400
-THEM FOLK DOWN THERE
KNOW ME AT THE STORE.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.233
I GOT SOME GUN CHARGE, MAN.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.867
AND I OWNED UP TO IT, MAN.

12:49.967 --> 12:51.767
I'M NOT FINNA--
SITTING HERE AND DOING
ALL THAT, MAN.

12:51.867 --> 12:53.467
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE Y'ALL GOT THAT
(bleep) FROM.

12:53.567 --> 12:54.933
THAT'S WHAT I'M TELLING.
-WELL, RIGHT NOW--

12:55.067 --> 12:57.067
-DID Y'ALL GET THAT (bleep)
FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING AT?

12:57.100 --> 12:58.633
-I SAW YOU RUNNING.

12:58.733 --> 13:01.133
THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYING,
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH THE GUN,

13:01.233 --> 13:02.800
SO WE'RE GONNA SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE GUN.

13:02.900 --> 13:06.300
-MAN, WE CAN DO FINGERPRINTS
AND EVERYTHING, BRO.
-BUT, AT THIS POINT--

13:06.400 --> 13:08.500
-THEN YOU COULD SEE
IF I HELD SOMETHING.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.133
-THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING,
AT THIS POINT...

13:10.233 --> 13:11.600
-I PROMISE YOU, MAN.
(rambling)

13:11.700 --> 13:14.600
-YOU'RE GONNA GET CHARGED
WITH THE POSSESSION
OF CRACK COCAINE,

13:14.700 --> 13:17.700
AND THEN DEPENDING ON
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE GUN,

13:17.800 --> 13:19.367
YOU MAY GET CHARGED
WITH THAT ALSO, OKAY?
-BRO.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.633
-I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW
WHAT THE SITUATION IS
RIGHT NOW.

13:23.567 --> 13:25.267
-I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE A COP.

13:25.367 --> 13:27.233
THE FLUIDNESS OF THE JOB
AND CHANGING SO MUCH,

13:27.333 --> 13:28.533
AND HOW EVERY DAY'S
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.600
JUST MADE ME SO
INTERESTED IN IT.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.467
SO I WENT TO COLLEGE
FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE,

13:32.567 --> 13:34.300
DID A FIVE-YEAR PROGRAM,

13:34.400 --> 13:37.100
AND WHEN I GRADUATED, I WAS
LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET CALLED FOR
THE CIVIL SERVICE LIST

13:37.200 --> 13:39.100
IN THE CITY I GREW UP IN.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.067
SO, NOW I'M HERE WORKING
REVERE AND I LOVE EVERY
MOMENT OF IT.

13:43.367 --> 13:45.267
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO
THE TRAILER PARK HERE

13:45.367 --> 13:47.500
TO ASSIST ANOTHER OFFICER
WITH A POSSIBLE LARCENY.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.500
UH, IT'S DESCRIBED THAT
A MALE AND FEMALE

13:49.600 --> 13:52.433
STOLE A PACKAGE OFF OF
SOMEONE'S FRONT DOOR

13:52.533 --> 13:55.233
AND TOOK OFF IN THE AREA
OF THE TRAILER PARKS.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.367
SO WE'RE GONNA TRY
TO LOCATE THOSE BODIES.

14:01.267 --> 14:02.633
HEY, HOLD ON A SECOND,
COME HERE.

14:02.733 --> 14:04.800
WHERE YOU GUYS

14:04.900 --> 14:06.233
TURN AROUND.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.767
-YOU CAN SEARCH ME.
I NEED MY MEDS ON ME.

14:07.867 --> 14:09.067
-OKAY.

14:09.167 --> 14:10.800
-THEY'RE IN MY POCKET.
-STAY RIGHT THERE, MAN.

14:12.267 --> 14:14.200
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?
TAKE OUT YOUR MEDS.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.533
-ME? OH, NICE.

14:15.633 --> 14:17.200
I KNOW YOUR NAME,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

14:17.300 --> 14:19.167
OKAY.

14:19.267 --> 14:21.167
HOLD ON A SECOND.

14:21.267 --> 14:22.800
PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.233
-WHAT DID I DO?

14:24.333 --> 14:25.533
-LISTEN, YOU'RE NOT
UNDER ARREST.

14:25.633 --> 14:27.333
YOU'RE BEING DETAINED.
-FOR WHAT?

14:27.433 --> 14:28.767
-'CAUSE YOU HAVE A WARRANT.

14:28.867 --> 14:30.633
-WHAT DID I GET A WARRANT FOR?
-DID YOU GET IT CLEARED?

14:30.733 --> 14:33.067
LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW.
I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU,
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.700
THEY PUT OUT A REVERE
MOST WANTED LIST--

14:34.800 --> 14:36.267
-WHEN?
-EVERY WEEK.

14:36.367 --> 14:38.300
YOUR NAME WAS ON IT,
SO LET ME JUST CHECK
YOUR INFORMATION--

14:38.400 --> 14:41.700
-PLEASE CHECK!
I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN
IN TROUBLE IN (bleep) YEARS.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.067
-OKAY. DID YOU JUST
TAKE A PACKAGE OFF OF
SOMEONE'S PORCH OR ANYTHING?

14:44.167 --> 14:45.700
-NO, I DIDN'T.
SOME GUY TRIED TO SAY THAT,

14:45.800 --> 14:47.867
I SAID, "WHAT? I HAVE
MY DOG'S BACKPACK."

14:47.967 --> 14:49.500
I WAS LIKE,
"THIS IS MY DOG'S BACKPACK!"

14:49.600 --> 14:51.267
AND HE TRIED TO GRAB ME
SO I TOOK OFF ON HIM.

14:51.367 --> 14:53.633
LIKE, HE GOT OUT OF HIS TRUCK,
TRIED TO GRAB ME.

14:53.733 --> 14:55.833
I'M LIKE,
"GET AWAY FROM ME."
HONESTLY.

14:55.933 --> 14:57.233
Man on Radio:
ONE-OH-SIX.

14:57.333 --> 14:58.967
-WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT IN ONE
SECOND. COME BACK HERE, OKAY?

14:59.067 --> 15:00.600
-HE INCRIMINATE HIMSELF
WITH THE TRUCK?

15:00.700 --> 15:01.800
SOMEBODY GRABBED HIM?

15:01.900 --> 15:03.233
-WE'RE UNDER CONTROL.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.233
LET ME KNOW ABOUT THIS PARTY,
WE HAVE ONE DETAINED FOR NOW.

15:05.333 --> 15:06.700
-WHY AM I GETTING DETAINED?

15:06.800 --> 15:08.367
-'CAUSE I'M TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S
GOING ON.

15:09.467 --> 15:10.800
-CAN I HAVE MY MEDS, PLEASE?

15:10.900 --> 15:12.500
-NO, YOU CAN HAVE THEM
WHEN YOU GET OUT
OF THE CAR, OKAY?

15:12.600 --> 15:14.133
-WHO WAS THE GIRL
YOU WERE WITH?
-HUH?

15:14.233 --> 15:15.800
THAT WAS MY GIRLFRIEND.
-WHAT'S HER NAME?

15:15.900 --> 15:17.067
-NICOLE. WHERE IS SHE?

15:17.100 --> 15:18.700
-WHY DID YOU
SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER?

15:18.800 --> 15:21.533
-BECAUSE SHE-- SHE--
THE GUY TRIED TO GRAB ME

15:21.633 --> 15:23.700
AND I'M LIKE,
"BABY, JUST STAY HERE.
I'M GONE."

15:23.800 --> 15:25.300
LIKE, HONESTLY.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.800
-LIKE, IF SOMEBODY'S TRYING
TO GRAB YOU--

15:26.900 --> 15:28.467
-BUT WHY WOULD YOU
LEAVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

15:28.567 --> 15:29.833
-SHE WAS FINE.

15:29.933 --> 15:32.067
THE GUY WAS AFTER
ME FOR SOME REASON.
THAT'S WHY.

15:32.167 --> 15:34.133
-START FROM THE BEGINNING.
YOU WERE WALKING--

15:34.233 --> 15:36.400
-SHE WAS AT RITE AID.
I WAS AT RITE AID.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.467
-WHAT HAPPENED AFTER RITE AID?
WHERE'D YOU GO AFTER RITE AID?

15:38.567 --> 15:41.633
-I CAME DOWN.
YOU CAN ASK JJ AND ALL THEM.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.800
WE CAME UP BY THE CHURCH.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.667
WE CAME DOWN HERE.

15:45.767 --> 15:50.067
I CUT NEAR THE OLD AGE HOME,
GOT UP HERE, I CAME THROUGH
THERE. RIGHT DOWN THERE.

15:50.167 --> 15:51.767
AND THAT'S IT.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.300
-BUT WHAT HAPPENED

AND THE GUY IN THE PICKUP TRUCK?

15:54.400 --> 15:56.833
-HE TRIED TO GRAB IT,
AND MY GIRL HAS IT.

15:56.933 --> 15:58.500
MY GIRL HAS HER BACKPACK.

15:58.600 --> 15:59.900
-WHY DID HE TRY TO GRAB YOU?

16:00.067 --> 16:01.800
-HE SAID THAT I TRIED
TO STEAL SOMETHING.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.400
I'M LIKE, "WHAT ARE YOU

"GET AWAY FROM ME."

16:07.433 --> 16:08.933
-OKAY.
-HE WAS LIKE,
"NO, COME HERE NOW!"

16:09.067 --> 16:10.367
AND HE TRIED
TO JUMP OUT OF HIS TRUCK.

16:10.467 --> 16:11.733
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

16:11.833 --> 16:13.167
HONESTLY, WHAT
WOULD YOU DO?

16:13.267 --> 16:15.600
-CALL THE POLICE.
-WITH WHAT? I DON'T
HAVE A CELLPHONE.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.367
-SO YOU RAN DOWN HERE
'CAUSE HE WAS CHASING YOU?

16:17.467 --> 16:19.100
-YEAH, HE WAS CHASING ME
DOWN HERE.
-OKAY.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.367
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME

16:22.900 --> 16:24.167

16:34.467 --> 16:35.900
-THAT WASN'T JAMES' BACKPACK.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.367
-OKAY.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.067
-AND THEN THERE WAS
NOTHING IN MY BACKPACK
BUT CIGARETTES.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.300
-OKAY. WHERE WERE
YOU GUYS COMING FROM?

16:40.400 --> 16:41.933
-I WAS COMING

16:42.067 --> 16:43.767
I RAN INTO MY FRIENDS
THAT WERE STANDING THERE

16:43.867 --> 16:45.200
PICKETING FOR THE NEW MAYOR.

16:45.300 --> 16:46.533
-HOW DO YOU KNOW JAMES?

16:46.633 --> 16:48.067
-I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME.

16:48.100 --> 16:51.067
(mumbles) HE'S FROM... PROJECTS.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.967
-HE SAID YOU'RE HIS GIRLFRIEND,
YOU DON'T KNOW HIS NAME?

16:53.067 --> 16:54.833
-LISTEN, WHATEVER.

16:54.933 --> 16:57.600
-HE SAID HE'S YOUR-- HE GAVE ME

16:57.700 --> 16:59.133
-THAT'S FINE, SIR.

16:59.233 --> 17:01.067
-YOU'RE NOT GONNA TRY
TO TELL ME WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

17:01.100 --> 17:02.367
-I ALREADY TRIED
TELLING THE OTHER GUYS.

17:02.467 --> 17:03.633
I'M NOT-- WHATEVER.

17:03.733 --> 17:05.467
-OKAY.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.433
-YEP, NO PROBLEM.

17:09.733 --> 17:11.400
SO WE'RE GONNA BRING
THE WITNESS OVER.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.600
DO A SHOW UP.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.533
-YEAH.
-JUST COME RIGHT DOWN
HERE FOR ME.

17:16.267 --> 17:17.800
-Officer on radio:
ROGER, THAT'S HIM.

17:19.233 --> 17:20.867
-OKAY, STEP THIS WAY.

17:22.067 --> 17:23.667
-HE ALREADY ADMITTED
TO IT TO ME.

17:23.767 --> 17:24.967
-ROGER?
-THAT HE DID IT.

17:25.067 --> 17:26.800
-YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU SAID
YOU'VE GOT MY GIRL.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.200
OF COURSE I'M GONNA
TELL YOU I DID IT.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.600
-YOUR GIRL SAYS SHE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.367
WE ASKED HER WHO YOU WERE
AND SHE SAID SOME DUDE

17:33.467 --> 17:35.700
FROM THE PROJECTS
THAT SHE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW WELL. SO...

17:35.800 --> 17:37.300
-ALL RIGHT.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.067
-WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED, MAN?

17:39.133 --> 17:40.367
-GOING HOME...

17:40.467 --> 17:42.633
UM, A KID-- A KID WAS
COMING UP THE STREET--

17:42.733 --> 17:44.767
ONE OF MY--
ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS, RIGHT?

17:44.867 --> 17:47.267
HE GOES LIKE THIS.
HE GOES-- I SAID,

17:47.367 --> 17:48.567
"DID THEY JUST STEAL
THAT PACKAGE?"

17:48.667 --> 17:49.967
HE GOES, "I THINK SO."

17:50.067 --> 17:52.500
SO, I TURNED MY TRUCK AROUND.
I CHASED THEM.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.133
WHEN I WAS CHASING THEM,
I WAS DOWN OVER-- OVER--

17:55.233 --> 17:56.700
OVER ON THAT STREET
OVER THERE.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.733
HE THREW THE PACKAGE,
HIM AND THE GIRL,

17:58.833 --> 18:00.067
SO I KEPT ON CHASING 'EM,

18:00.167 --> 18:02.433
AND THAT'S THE TIME
WHEN THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT.

18:02.533 --> 18:04.400
AND THIS IS THE GIRL
OVER HERE,

18:04.500 --> 18:06.633
SO I DIDN'T WANT
TO HOLD THE GIRL.
-OKAY.

18:06.733 --> 18:08.967
-BECAUSE THE GIRL, I MEAN,
I COULD GET IN TROUBLE.
-NO, NO. ABSOLUTELY.

18:09.067 --> 18:11.433
-SO, I JUST WAITED WITH HER.
I WALKED ACROSS THE STREET

18:11.533 --> 18:13.233
AND I SAID,
"WE'RE GONNA GET YOU,"
AND THIS AND THAT.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.300
SHE GOES,
"I'M NOT WITH THAT KID."

18:15.400 --> 18:16.633
-OH, SO SHE SAID
SHE'S NOT WITH HIM?

18:16.733 --> 18:18.767
I SAID, "YOU'RE WITH HIM.
YOU WERE RIGHT SIDE-BY-SIDE

18:18.867 --> 18:22.367
WITH HIM, TALKING TO HIM,
WHEN YOU THREW THE PACKAGE
ON THE GROUND OVER THERE."

18:22.467 --> 18:23.800
-WHO DOES THIS BELONG TO?
-HE DOESN'T KNOW.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.100
HE JUST PICKED IT UP
ON THE NOSE.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.067
SO, IF THE ADDRESS
IS ON THERE...
-DO YOU SEE IT?

18:27.100 --> 18:29.267
-YEAH, HE SAW THEM
SNUCK IT OFF A (indistinct).
-SEE?

18:29.367 --> 18:31.167
AND THEN HE OPENED IT UP.
SEE HOW THEY OPENED IT?

18:31.267 --> 18:33.133
AND THEN THEY THREW IT
'CAUSE THEY COULDN'T...

18:33.233 --> 18:35.067
SHE WAS GONNA PUT IT
PROBABLY IN HER BAG.

18:35.133 --> 18:36.267
HOW 'BOUT THE STUFF
INSIDE HER BAG?

18:36.367 --> 18:38.133
SHE PROBABLY GOT
SOME STUFF IN THERE.

18:38.233 --> 18:40.633
-YEAH, THEY'LL GO THROUGH
THAT ALL. THEY'LL PROCESS HER
ALL AT THE STATION, OKAY?

18:40.733 --> 18:43.167
-AND THERE'S THE--
YOU CAN SEE HIS FINGERPRINTS
RIGHT THERE, SO...

18:43.267 --> 18:45.233
-ALL RIGHT, MAN.
-THANKS.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.633
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

18:46.733 --> 18:47.833
-HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, SIR.

18:49.167 --> 18:51.100

-YEAH?

18:51.200 --> 18:53.600
-YOU GOTTA BE

18:53.700 --> 18:56.067

-I KNOW SHE DOES.

18:56.133 --> 18:58.067
-OKAY, BUT SHE'S GONNA END UP
GETTING ANOTHER CHARGE

18:58.167 --> 19:00.133
UNLESS YOU'RE HONEST WITH ME
AND TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

19:00.233 --> 19:03.800
THE WHOLE BACKPACK STORY IS
JUST NOT MAKING SENSE TO US,

19:03.900 --> 19:07.067
SO NOW IS YOUR CHANCE
TO TALK TO ME AND TELL ME

19:12.100 --> 19:13.733
-BUT IF YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED,

19:13.833 --> 19:15.667
YOUR GIRL'S GONNA GET CHARGED
WITH IT AS WELL.

19:15.767 --> 19:17.133
SO, I'M TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT THE STORY

19:17.233 --> 19:18.567
SO I CAN...

19:18.667 --> 19:19.867
