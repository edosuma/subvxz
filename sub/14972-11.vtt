00:01.002 --> 00:02.534
<i> Previously on Van Helsing.</i>

00:02.536 --> 00:04.036
It's like a dream.

00:04.038 --> 00:05.738
Welcome to Eden!

00:05.740 --> 00:06.605
It was gorman.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.874
He had a hold of Axel,
i had to let go.

00:08.876 --> 00:10.109
You shut the door on him?

00:10.111 --> 00:11.510
This is where we say good-bye.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.579
Remember when I used to tell you
about my folks farm.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.180
It's not far from here.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.548
On the way to Denver.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.616
Magdalene,

00:17.618 --> 00:19.084
you're three days early.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.552
Mica, there are
no children here.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.354
What's going to happen
to that baby?

00:22.356 --> 00:24.456
These were promised to me.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.792
I was never meant
to be human again.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.627
Nothing is happening!

00:28.629 --> 00:31.830
Stay away or die!!

00:31.832 --> 00:33.465
Oh no!

00:33.467 --> 00:35.467
( Screaming )

00:45.112 --> 00:47.446
( Growling )

00:47.448 --> 00:49.048
Ahhh!!!

00:52.386 --> 00:56.055
Nothing.

00:56.057 --> 01:01.160
And yet I was told a child
was due.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.429
My tribute.

01:03.431 --> 01:07.366
I collected the child,
i promise you.

01:07.368 --> 01:10.102
But you lost it.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.136
( Gasps )

01:11.138 --> 01:12.471
( Snarling )

01:15.976 --> 01:21.313
I was looking forward
to that delicacy.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.749
( Gasping )

01:26.987 --> 01:29.455
There is nothing like

01:29.457 --> 01:36.128
the freshly suckled blood
of a newborn.

01:37.331 --> 01:41.200
( Growling and snarling )

01:41.202 --> 01:44.670
The arrangement...
Has been broken.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.705
I did my bidding.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.674
Broken by whom?

01:50.344 --> 01:53.078
( Growling and snarling )

01:53.080 --> 01:55.547
( Stuttering )

01:58.819 --> 01:59.718
( Growling )

01:59.720 --> 02:00.953
( Screaming )

02:00.955 --> 02:02.454
No, no, no, no!

02:02.456 --> 02:03.722
It was her!

02:03.724 --> 02:04.957
It was the woman
you're looking for.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.725
It was her.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.497
And yet you hesitate to tell me.

02:13.434 --> 02:16.702
Dmitri seeks her as well.

02:16.704 --> 02:20.472
He does not know of my alliance
with you.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.541
He would have me skinned alive.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.377
( Growls in rage )

02:27.648 --> 02:31.517
And yet you think I will not.

02:31.519 --> 02:36.088
Please... I will take you
to them.

02:36.090 --> 02:38.891
I will show you the path.

02:49.236 --> 02:51.537
Tonight we march.

02:56.076 --> 02:59.912
<i> ( Growling )</i>

03:43.958 --> 03:45.357
It's not far now.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.092
Good.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.527
I want us to be out of
these woods by the time

03:48.529 --> 03:50.429
the sun goes down.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.270
This is it.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.772
That's the house
i grew up in.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.274
Wow.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.678
It's beautiful.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.647
And secluded.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.523
What's the big antenna for?

04:18.525 --> 04:22.294
Uh, it could be a radio tower?

04:22.296 --> 04:23.929
Susan?

04:27.101 --> 04:28.834
I don't know, I haven't...

04:28.836 --> 04:31.470
I haven't been here for a while.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.176
Hello?

04:38.178 --> 04:39.311
Mom?

04:39.313 --> 04:40.812
Dad?

04:44.485 --> 04:46.218
Oh, shit.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.519
( Flies buzzing )

04:47.521 --> 04:49.187
Mom?!

04:49.189 --> 04:51.223
Dad?!

04:53.160 --> 04:54.326
Mom?

04:54.328 --> 04:55.227
That's fresh blood.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.828
Dad?

05:00.534 --> 05:02.301
Oh, shit.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.009
( Sighs )

05:11.011 --> 05:12.844
Damn.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.166
It's my mother.

05:34.168 --> 05:39.438
You didn't know?

05:39.440 --> 05:42.074
She died five years ago.

05:42.076 --> 05:47.012
Before the rising.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.113
Exactly how long has it been

05:48.115 --> 05:52.017
since you've seen or talked
to your parents, Susan?

05:52.019 --> 05:55.754
I don't wanna talk about it.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.756
Maybe we should look
for your father.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.124
No.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.961
No, whatever happened to him,
he deserved.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.268
( Growling in the distance )

06:10.270 --> 06:12.037
Back inside.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.605
You don't gotta tell me twice.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.475
( Distant growling )

06:32.826 --> 06:37.496
As tempting as it is to sleep
in a real bed in a real bedroom,

06:37.498 --> 06:39.164
I think we're safer up here.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.400
Together.

06:41.402 --> 06:44.836
Where we can be defensible,
you know?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.271
Any objections?

06:46.273 --> 06:48.507
Nope, none here.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.078
Here it is.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.114
It's the gun my father taught me
to hunt with.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.350
He's probably got ammo
stashed up here somewhere.

06:58.352 --> 07:00.452
I bet I know where
the bastard hid it.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.524
Susan, the radio
antenna outside.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.526
Is it connected to anything?

07:07.528 --> 07:09.628
It's new from the last time
i was here.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.034
I can check the cable where
it comes in from the roof

07:16.036 --> 07:18.003
in the house.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.438
Thanks, mohamad.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.173
Dammit.

07:23.177 --> 07:25.510
Susan, that can wait
until tomorrow.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.946
He used to have the ammo
stashed all over the house.

07:27.948 --> 07:33.185
Made sure it was never
in just one place.

07:33.187 --> 07:34.719
He made sure it was all
in different places,

07:34.721 --> 07:36.388
I have no idea why.

07:36.390 --> 07:39.324
Hey, hey, hey.

07:39.326 --> 07:41.693
It's ok.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.028
We'll find it, ok?

07:43.030 --> 07:45.230
We will.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.316
Uh, Susan?

08:04.318 --> 08:05.317
Jackpot!

08:05.319 --> 08:08.086
Holy shit.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.188
Susan.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.725
( White noise )

08:13.727 --> 08:14.693
( Laughs )

08:14.695 --> 08:15.861
It's got power!

08:15.863 --> 08:17.462
What?

08:17.464 --> 08:19.464
The windmills probably
charge the batteries.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.933
My dad was a survivalist
nut job.

08:21.935 --> 08:25.370
Always joking about preparing
for the end of time.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.972
He never would have got-

08:26.974 --> 08:33.545
<i> ( radio ) ...There was,</i>
<i> uh, six days worth...</i>
<i> Told me to leave it there.</i>

08:33.547 --> 08:34.613
Hello? Is someone there?

08:34.615 --> 08:36.214
Can you hear me?

08:36.216 --> 08:37.616
<i> What? Hello?</i>

08:37.618 --> 08:38.650
<i> Is that someone trying</i>
<i> to talk?</i>

08:38.652 --> 08:41.019
Yes, can you hear me? Hello?

08:41.021 --> 08:41.753
<i> Is there someone there?</i>

08:41.755 --> 08:42.621
<i> I can only hear clicks.</i>

08:42.623 --> 08:44.789
Oh, shit. The hand mic's busted.

08:44.791 --> 08:48.260
We can only receive,
not send.

08:48.262 --> 08:50.228
Anyone know morse code?

08:50.230 --> 08:53.398
<i> Click the mic twice</i>
<i> if you can hear me.</i>

08:53.400 --> 08:54.633
Worth a try.

08:54.635 --> 08:55.600
( Clicks mic )

08:55.602 --> 08:56.818
<i> Holy shit!</i>

08:56.819 --> 08:58.035
<i> I don't believe it.</i>

08:58.038 --> 08:59.337
<i> I've been yammering</i>
<i> for weeks on this thing</i>

08:59.339 --> 09:00.906
<i> hoping to hear</i>
<i> another human voice.</i>

09:00.908 --> 09:03.909
<i> Wait a minute, you're human,</i>
<i> right?</i>

09:03.911 --> 09:05.777
<i> Click twice for "yes".</i>

09:05.779 --> 09:07.579
( Clicks mic )

09:07.581 --> 09:09.247
<i> Ok, I'll take</i>
<i> your word for it.</i>

09:09.249 --> 09:10.849
<i> My name's Gordon orwell.</i>

09:10.851 --> 09:11.516
( Laughs )

09:11.518 --> 09:12.401
<i> Gordo for short.</i>

09:12.402 --> 09:13.285
<i> I'm in salt lake city.</i>

09:13.287 --> 09:14.819
Salt lake city.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.121
I wonder if in salt lake
city it's-

09:16.123 --> 09:18.757
<i> in case you're wondering,</i>
<i> it's a disaster.</i>

09:18.759 --> 09:20.926
<i> A goddamn vampire-infested</i>
<i> cesspool,</i>

09:20.928 --> 09:23.128
<i> even worse than the mormons</i>
<i> used to be.</i>

09:23.130 --> 09:24.129
<i> That's a joke.</i>

09:24.131 --> 09:25.196
( Laughs )

09:25.198 --> 09:26.064
<i> Uh, yeah.</i>

09:26.066 --> 09:27.732
<i> They've pretty much</i>
<i> taken over.</i>

09:27.734 --> 09:28.800
<i> I'm not staying much longer.</i>

09:28.802 --> 09:31.536
<i> I've scammed just</i>
<i> about all I can.</i>

09:31.538 --> 09:34.205
<i> Met some resistance folks</i>
<i> a month back,</i>

09:34.207 --> 09:36.641
<i> they said Denver's</i>
<i> the place to go.</i>

09:36.643 --> 09:37.842
Denver?

09:37.844 --> 09:41.780
<i> Mile-high city, above the smog</i>
<i> and cloud most days.</i>

09:41.782 --> 09:44.349
<i>The last place the bloodsuckers</i>
<i> will find themselves.</i>

10:09.576 --> 10:11.109
<i> Could be where we stage</i>
<i> a counter-attack</i>

10:11.111 --> 10:13.111
<i> and finally take the fight</i>
<i> to these bastards.</i>

10:13.113 --> 10:14.045
Hell yeah.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.146
( Clicks mic )

10:15.148 --> 10:16.581
<i> You agree.</i>

10:16.583 --> 10:17.749
<i> Well, yeah.</i>

10:17.751 --> 10:22.921
<i> You know what they say,</i>
<i> make plans and god laughs.</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:41.673
<i> I wish I could hear</i>
<i> your voice.</i>

10:41.675 --> 10:43.908
<i> It's been a while since</i>
<i> I've heard a friendly voice.</i>

10:51.385 --> 10:55.520
<i> Fire's getting low,</i>
<i> I better sign off, I guess.</i>

10:55.522 --> 10:58.356
<i> Gotta recharge the batteries.</i>

10:58.358 --> 10:59.758
<i> I'll be up in the morning back</i>

10:59.760 --> 11:03.795
<i>assuming I don't blow my brains</i>

11:13.607 --> 11:15.440
<i> Pray for sun.</i>

<i> Gordo out.</i>

11:28.355 --> 11:30.689

( Sobbing )

12:00.554 --> 12:02.187
( Laughs )

12:02.189 --> 12:03.254
Woah.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.557
Look at you, man!

12:05.559 --> 12:07.492
Lookin' good.

12:07.494 --> 12:12.263
You got change?

12:12.265 --> 12:14.733
Feels good.

12:14.735 --> 12:19.170
( Laughs )

12:19.172 --> 12:21.339
It does.

12:21.341 --> 12:25.243
I think we could all use a
change just about now, huh?

12:25.245 --> 12:28.546
Oh yeah, I agree.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.883
So, where to next?

12:31.885 --> 12:32.851
Why even ask?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.686
We can stay here.

12:38.892 --> 12:39.991
What?

12:44.231 --> 12:48.133
Look, Susan, i- I gotta go
to Denver.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.634
If there's a chance
that Dylan's there?

12:49.636 --> 12:52.570
I gotta go.

12:52.572 --> 12:53.872
Plus, you know what gordo
was saying?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.340
About it being high altitude?

12:55.342 --> 12:56.875
Maybe the skies
are clear there.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.210
And I still have to find sheema.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.379
There's a vampire work camp
south from here.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.382
That's where we got separated.

13:04.384 --> 13:08.853
If I get her out maybe
we can go to Denver, too.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.556
Seriously?

13:11.558 --> 13:14.225
We have everything
we need here.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.727
You guys know the odds outside,

13:15.729 --> 13:17.829
and Denver's hundreds
of miles away.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.731
You're seriously
gonna stay here?

13:19.733 --> 13:21.533
Yeah, damn right.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.001
There's no way anybody
would find this place

13:23.003 --> 13:25.036
unless they knew about it.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.572
( Sharp noise outside )

13:27.574 --> 13:29.007
Grab your weapons!

13:38.285 --> 13:39.651
( Noise continues )

13:39.653 --> 13:41.519
Something's outside.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.000
Woah.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.737
Oh my god, it's strider.

13:59.739 --> 14:02.373
She's the horse I learned
to ride on.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.009
She probably has been
staying close to the farm.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.278
I can't believe it.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.180
She's beautiful.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.087
We could kill it.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.189
I mean, for food, of course.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.459
( Growling )

14:21.461 --> 14:22.393
Oh my god!

14:22.395 --> 14:24.062
( Horse whinnies )

14:24.064 --> 14:27.131
No, Vanessa, you'll kill her!

14:27.133 --> 14:29.500
( Gun shot )

14:29.502 --> 14:30.401
What are you doing?!

14:30.403 --> 14:31.169
Vanessa!

14:31.171 --> 14:33.037
I gotta get a clean shot!

14:33.039 --> 14:35.340
( Growling )

14:35.342 --> 14:36.875
Hold up, hold up!

14:36.877 --> 14:41.079
( Growling )

14:41.081 --> 14:42.647
( Gun shot )

14:43.917 --> 14:44.515
( Cocks gun )

14:44.517 --> 14:49.087
Wait!! That's my dad!

14:49.089 --> 14:50.788
( Growling )

15:01.167 --> 15:09.407
( Snarling )

15:21.788 --> 15:22.921
Now what?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.422
Well, what do we do?

15:24.424 --> 15:26.257
What can we do?

15:28.528 --> 15:32.764
Sam says maybe Vanessa can
bite him, bring him back?

15:32.766 --> 15:35.833
I've never bitten
any ferals before.

15:35.835 --> 15:36.968
The ones that bite me, die.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.603
He doesn't look that far gone,
right?

15:38.605 --> 15:42.740
( Intense snarling )

15:42.742 --> 15:44.542
Or not.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.512
No, I don't want him back.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.181
He got what he deserved.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.250
The way he treated her?

15:52.252 --> 15:53.718
I'm glad my mother died

15:53.720 --> 15:56.154
before she saw the world
turn to shit!

15:56.156 --> 15:58.289
( Snarling )

16:02.262 --> 16:05.797
Enough. I can't take
this anymore.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.066
Nobody wants him to suffer.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.635
I don't have a problem
with it.

16:13.406 --> 16:16.441
He's the reason I had
to leave home.

16:16.443 --> 16:21.946
He's the reason I lost touch
with my mother.

16:21.948 --> 16:26.050
I never told her what he did
to me.

16:26.052 --> 16:27.952
She never knew.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.260
He kept me away.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.529
Cut me off.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.798
Never told me that she died!

16:40.800 --> 16:43.935
I mean, what kind of monster
can do that?!

16:46.740 --> 16:59.817
( Snarling )

17:05.125 --> 17:08.026
If there's any part of the man
you used to be in there,

17:08.028 --> 17:11.996
then that part
can hear me.

17:11.998 --> 17:17.735
Then you know you deserve
this, even if you hadn't turned.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.904
( Gun shot )

17:24.110 --> 17:26.544
Closure.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.017
Holy shit.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.872
Hey, hold on.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.207
Hold on.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.842
Hold on, Sam, wait.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.078
Wait, wait, wait.

18:00.080 --> 18:04.148
Susan might wanna say
a few words.

18:04.150 --> 18:04.749
I can't find her.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.517
Have you seen her?

18:06.519 --> 18:07.518
Nope.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.188
Will you look inside the house?

18:10.190 --> 18:14.058
Sam, woods.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.993
I'll check the barn.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.452
Hey, Susan?

18:41.454 --> 18:43.354
Susan!

18:45.024 --> 18:46.824
Susan?

18:57.971 --> 18:59.871
Yeah, don't bother, Sam.

18:59.873 --> 19:02.373
I don't need to be
a part of it.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.984
Sure, have a seat.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.620
I'm not good company
right now.

19:21.060 --> 19:27.465
You wanna know how I am?

19:27.467 --> 19:30.868
I feel like I'm just barely
hanging on.

19:30.870 --> 19:36.274
Like all this, whatever
happened here,

19:36.276 --> 19:38.309
it's just a reminder of
how shitty the world is

19:38.311 --> 19:42.780
and how shitty the world was
and how everything good can...

19:42.782 --> 19:47.752
Disappear in an instant.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.187
I'm not even talking
about my dad.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.022
It's just the reality
of existing like this.

19:51.024 --> 19:51.822
Being hunted.

19:51.824 --> 19:55.927
Fighting to survive.

19:55.929 --> 20:02.500
The whole exercise.

20:02.502 --> 20:05.203
You understand me?

20:19.619 --> 20:21.385
Sam?

20:25.959 --> 20:28.726
( Exhales )

20:30.363 --> 20:33.531
Hey, it's gonna be ok.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.669
Come here.

20:53.186 --> 20:59.590
( Sobbing )

21:16.676 --> 21:19.944
Wha...Wha...Wha?!!

21:19.946 --> 21:29.987
( Gasping )

21:29.989 --> 21:41.966
( Gasping )

22:42.195 --> 22:51.402
( Sizzling )

22:51.404 --> 22:55.239
We will walk in the sunshine
together.

22:55.241 --> 22:58.109
And soon.

22:58.111 --> 23:03.381
Once we have captured the woman,
our blood mixed with hers...

23:09.422 --> 23:14.658
You have promised me
this for years now,

23:14.660 --> 23:20.598
even before we knew
of the woman.

23:20.600 --> 23:25.936
You promised me hundreds more
years of walking on the earth

23:25.938 --> 23:30.007
with my children.

23:30.009 --> 23:36.447
Night and day.

23:36.449 --> 23:42.119
I wonder if you make
these promises

23:42.121 --> 23:50.761
with the knowledge
they are false.

23:50.763 --> 23:55.466
Maybe you are simply
buying more time.

23:55.468 --> 24:00.504
If so, what for?

24:00.506 --> 24:07.711
Please, don't lose faith
in me.

24:07.713 --> 24:14.952
Then explain to me how these
promises become reality.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.787
( Sizzling )

24:16.789 --> 24:19.390
( Speaking Romanian )

24:22.595 --> 24:25.863
I will.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.165
I know the way.

24:59.699 --> 25:02.933
Hey, Susan?

25:02.935 --> 25:05.236
You in there?

25:22.488 --> 25:24.321
Susan?

25:35.535 --> 25:38.669
Anything?

25:38.671 --> 25:39.637
No sign of her.

25:39.639 --> 25:43.140
Yeah, I didn't find her, either.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.975
Sam says we should
keep looking.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.410
Ok.

25:46.412 --> 25:48.178
Did you check the stable?

25:51.684 --> 25:53.317
What is it?

25:56.222 --> 25:57.988
What?

25:57.990 --> 26:01.091
No, it's nothing.

26:01.093 --> 26:03.427
I'm gonna check
the house again.

26:04.997 --> 26:05.963
Ok.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.465
I'll wait out here in case
she comes back.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.939
Hey, Susan?

26:14.941 --> 26:16.907
You up here?

26:51.844 --> 26:54.478
Holy shit.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.563
Hey, man.

27:12.565 --> 27:17.701
I was looking for this.

27:17.703 --> 27:20.070
You find Susan?

27:27.013 --> 27:29.713
Yeah, I guess so.

27:51.303 --> 27:54.071
What's the matter?

27:54.073 --> 27:56.407
What, did you find Susan?

27:56.409 --> 28:00.210
No, and I don't think we will.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.012
Wha- why are you saying that?

28:02.014 --> 28:05.449
Um... I really think you guys
killed the wrong guy.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.251
John is not the killer.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.919
What?

28:08.921 --> 28:13.123
( Stuttering ) It's- it's hard
to believe, and I wouldn't...

28:13.125 --> 28:14.425
Unless I saw it with
my own eyes-

28:14.427 --> 28:15.192
saw what?

28:15.194 --> 28:16.260
He-

28:25.538 --> 28:27.438
s- Sam?

28:29.809 --> 28:32.309
I killed Susan.

28:43.723 --> 28:46.190
No.

28:46.192 --> 28:50.194
( Sobbing )

28:50.196 --> 28:53.030
No!

28:58.170 --> 29:03.173
( Sobbing )
No!

29:03.175 --> 29:06.310
Noooooo!!!!!!

29:41.814 --> 29:44.615
( Cocks gun )

29:44.617 --> 29:48.619
Why?

29:48.621 --> 29:53.757
Why did you do it, Sam?

29:53.759 --> 29:56.326
It's who I am.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.629
Who I've always been.

29:58.631 --> 30:01.064
Since I was a boy.

30:01.066 --> 30:06.470
Since you were a boy?

30:06.472 --> 30:13.143
What kind of sick...

30:13.145 --> 30:14.578
Wait for me in the house,
mohamad.

30:14.580 --> 30:15.412
Woah, woah, woah.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.781
What're you gonna do?

30:17.783 --> 30:19.983
I'm gonna take Sam for a walk.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.785
Straighten things out.

30:21.787 --> 30:24.588
Do what you gotta do here.

30:24.590 --> 30:29.126
I don't want gun shots
attracting ferals to the house.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.562
Well, I wanna come.

30:31.564 --> 30:33.730
No you don't.

30:33.732 --> 30:34.598
Trust me.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.899
You need me.

30:35.901 --> 30:38.969
You need me to translate.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.938
I don't expect much talking.

30:40.940 --> 30:44.041
Vanessa, you don't
know what'll come up.

30:44.043 --> 30:47.144
He might have information
that you might need.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.078
I can communicate that.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.981
He's probably not even
really deaf, ok?

30:50.983 --> 30:55.519
He's probably been faking it
this whole time.

30:55.521 --> 30:59.389
What's he saying?

30:59.391 --> 31:02.426
What's he saying?!

31:02.428 --> 31:04.828
Sam... no man.

31:09.902 --> 31:12.436
It doesn't matter.

31:12.438 --> 31:16.974
I'm not staying here alone.

31:16.976 --> 31:20.177
I'm coming with you.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.145
You sure about that?

31:24.683 --> 31:26.383
Yeah.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.486
I'm sure.

31:29.488 --> 31:35.025
Ok then.

31:35.027 --> 31:37.661
Walk.

31:59.652 --> 32:01.585
That's far enough.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.959
You know why.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.533
This is not about me, Sam.

32:16.535 --> 32:17.467
Goddammit!

32:17.469 --> 32:19.369
What is he saying?

32:21.974 --> 32:23.573
This is bullshit.

32:28.414 --> 32:31.815
Sam, shut your mouth.

32:31.817 --> 32:33.583
Don't listen to him, mohamad.

32:33.585 --> 32:34.251
Ok?

32:34.253 --> 32:36.119
He's a psychopath,

32:36.121 --> 32:40.357
and manipulating his victims
is part of the thrill.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.225
Tell him to close his eyes.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.768
Tell him.

32:54.707 --> 32:57.874
Tell him to close his eyes,
mohamad.

33:04.850 --> 33:07.551
Tell him to close his eyes!

33:08.787 --> 33:12.956
Do what you gotta do.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.791
Mohamad?

33:14.793 --> 33:17.160
Yeah.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.530
See what you've done
to your friend?

33:20.532 --> 33:22.532
To Susan?

33:22.534 --> 33:23.700
To me?

33:23.702 --> 33:25.969
All I ever do, protect you.

33:25.971 --> 33:27.104
No.

33:27.106 --> 33:30.173
Everyone you killed
trusted you.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.541
Susan was weak.

33:31.543 --> 33:32.843
You know that is danger.

33:32.845 --> 33:33.944
Shut up.

33:33.946 --> 33:34.778
Tell her!

33:34.780 --> 33:35.512
Close your eyes!

33:35.514 --> 33:36.313
Tell her!

33:36.315 --> 33:37.481
Shut your goddamn eyes!

33:37.483 --> 33:38.448
Tell her!

33:38.450 --> 33:42.319
Tell her the truth!

33:48.293 --> 33:50.027
Aaaaarrgh!

33:50.929 --> 33:52.662
Mohamad!

34:07.012 --> 34:10.814
( Sobbing ) I trusted you, Sam.

34:10.816 --> 34:14.184
I trusted you.

34:14.186 --> 34:17.621
You broke my heart.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.523
You broke my...

34:22.694 --> 34:25.662
( Coughing )

34:30.636 --> 34:32.035
Let's go.

34:32.037 --> 34:35.205
What?

34:35.207 --> 34:38.208
Leave him here to die.

34:38.210 --> 34:41.344
He doesn't deserve
a quick death.

34:45.517 --> 34:48.819
We're not killers.

34:48.821 --> 34:50.754
Karma will take
care of the rest.

34:50.756 --> 34:58.228
( Cries out in agony )

34:58.230 --> 34:59.329
Goodbye, Sam.

34:59.331 --> 35:01.531
( Cries out )

35:01.533 --> 35:08.505
( Gasping )

35:08.507 --> 35:10.574
Mohamad!

35:10.576 --> 35:14.845
Mohamad! Mohamad!!!

35:14.847 --> 35:18.915
( Gasping )

35:28.961 --> 35:32.162
The human resistance is
counting on the clearing skies

35:32.164 --> 35:35.332
to alter the course of
this war.

35:35.334 --> 35:39.803
They are waiting to make
their next move.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.972
And given what is happening,

35:41.974 --> 35:45.175
I believe they'll make it soon.

35:45.177 --> 35:48.445
They will strike us here
in our fortress

35:48.447 --> 35:52.883
and they will use the sunlight
as their ally and main weapon.

35:52.885 --> 35:56.419
That is the logical strategy.

35:56.421 --> 36:00.891
But we can reverse this fate
with one simple move.

36:00.893 --> 36:03.360
We accelerate our work.

36:03.362 --> 36:08.465
We double our efforts to
find and capture the woman.

36:08.467 --> 36:12.502
She is known as someone
who can turn us human.

36:12.504 --> 36:17.974
But what is never mentioned
is her vampiric qualities.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.509
Her strength.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.212
Her rage.

36:22.214 --> 36:25.849
Yet she walks in the sun.

36:25.851 --> 36:29.452
She is more like us
than human.

36:29.454 --> 36:32.222
Therefore, the key to our
ability to resist the sun

36:32.224 --> 36:36.059
is within her.

36:36.061 --> 36:39.362
By doing this we not only
find a cure,

36:39.364 --> 36:44.201
we remove her as a weapon the
resistance may use against us.

36:44.203 --> 36:47.103
Give me a legion of your
best soldiers.

36:47.105 --> 36:50.240
Allow me to purge the human
resistance once and for all

36:50.242 --> 36:53.677
and capture
this woman alive.

36:53.679 --> 36:56.213
I will return with your prize.

36:58.584 --> 37:01.651
( Small laugh )

37:01.653 --> 37:05.722
Like the Roman generals
returned to Caesar,

37:05.724 --> 37:08.191
only to usurp him.

37:08.193 --> 37:09.492
I would- I would never.

37:09.494 --> 37:13.230
With my armies you can do
whatever you like.

37:13.232 --> 37:20.770
With Julius so eager to defy me
you would find a willing ally.

37:20.772 --> 37:24.374
No, you will not take
these steps.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.076
Dmitri, you know me.

37:26.078 --> 37:30.547
You will do nothing whatsoever.

37:30.549 --> 37:35.719
You will remain here where
i can keep my eye on you.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.754
But what about the woman?

37:37.756 --> 37:42.092
As long as she is out there
she remains a threat.

37:42.094 --> 37:47.731
As I told you before, that
is already being dealt with.

37:57.209 --> 38:00.977
( Crows cawing )

38:29.274 --> 38:34.511
( Groaning )

38:46.958 --> 38:48.391
( Cries out )

38:57.602 --> 39:01.871
She loved this place.

39:01.873 --> 39:05.108
I'm glad she gets to spend
eternity here.

39:05.110 --> 39:08.144
They're together.

39:08.146 --> 39:12.248
Family again.

39:12.250 --> 39:15.719
Just you and me now.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.053
Yep.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.891
( Growling )

39:21.893 --> 39:25.395
( Cries out )

39:25.397 --> 39:27.664
( Snarling )

39:51.189 --> 39:55.558
( Cries out in agony )

40:14.646 --> 40:16.246
It's done.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.234
Where to next?

40:41.907 --> 40:45.308
Well, I'm thinking Denver still
makes a lot of sense to me.

40:45.310 --> 40:47.277
Denver.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.745
Huh.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.648
Look, I know you still wanna
find your sister

40:51.650 --> 40:55.885
and I don't expect you to
come with me, ok?

40:55.887 --> 40:59.122
Maybe this is where we
split up.

40:59.124 --> 41:03.393
Uh, yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

41:03.395 --> 41:06.629
We're safer together.

41:06.631 --> 41:07.764
We could combine forces.

41:07.766 --> 41:09.232
Combine goals.

41:09.234 --> 41:12.936
The camp that sheema's being
held at is on the way to Denver.

41:12.938 --> 41:15.805
In fact, Dylan might be there.

41:15.807 --> 41:16.372
Mohamad-

41:16.374 --> 41:17.774
no, seriously.

41:17.776 --> 41:22.278
They rounded up people
from Seattle to this camp.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.181
Kids, too.

41:25.183 --> 41:26.950
It could be the only chance
you've got--

41:26.952 --> 41:34.657
<i> ( wailing in the distance )</i>

41:34.659 --> 41:37.827
<i> ( Sam ): I can hear you!</i>

41:37.829 --> 41:39.829
Is that...

41:46.738 --> 41:48.805
( Whispers ) We have to go!
We got to go now!!!!

41:48.807 --> 41:52.775
<i> I can hear you!</i>

41:52.777 --> 41:56.513
<i> ( Laughter )</i>
