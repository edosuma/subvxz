it would be good for her,

42:34.158 --> 42:35.812
Boss.

42:46.176 --> 42:47.576
[Sighs]

42:47.601 --> 42:48.861
[Breathing heavily]

42:48.886 --> 42:51.228
You talk to your father.

42:58.515 --> 43:00.048
[Door opens]

43:03.849 --> 43:05.389
[Door closes]

43:06.746 --> 43:08.404
[Vehicle door opens]

43:10.094 --> 43:11.529
[Vehicle door closes]

43:13.279 --> 43:14.327
I promise,

43:14.352 --> 43:15.412
- as soon as you see the first one,
- [Door closes]

43:15.437 --> 43:17.437
you're gonna want the whole package.

43:18.590 --> 43:20.394
Um, take about an hour.

43:20.419 --> 43:22.619
Um, so, I'll bring the
whole team down there.

43:22.644 --> 43:24.600
We'll be there 12:30 sharp.

43:24.625 --> 43:26.959
I'm gonna turn you into a star.

43:27.272 --> 43:30.975
Absolutely. It will be on
the air by tomorrow afternoon.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.425
[Chuckling] I know. It is amazing.

43:33.858 --> 43:38.453
Okay. And, uh, don't wear
stripes, 'cause you'll moiré.

43:38.489 --> 43:39.772
It's a film-making term.

43:39.797 --> 43:41.404
Just... just don't wear stripes.

43:41.429 --> 43:42.811
Okay. See you then.

43:42.836 --> 43:44.100
[Cellphone beeps]

43:45.125 --> 43:46.717
- [Sighs]
- Wanna beer?

43:46.742 --> 43:48.186
Yes. Thanks.

43:48.211 --> 43:50.850
So, sleeping in your own bed tonight.

43:50.875 --> 43:53.100
Things must be lookin' up.

43:53.804 --> 43:55.748
I needed clean clothes.

43:56.785 --> 43:58.684
What was all that?

43:58.709 --> 44:01.341
Well, I'm unloading that ad time.

44:01.366 --> 44:03.164
But I thought you couldn't sell it.

44:03.189 --> 44:04.842
Well, that's the thing... I'm not.

44:04.867 --> 44:07.165
Uh, they pay me to make a commercial,

44:07.190 --> 44:09.223
I throw in the airtime for free.

44:09.248 --> 44:10.973
- Smart.
- [Chuckling] Yeah.

44:10.998 --> 44:14.272
I spent most of the day
going door-to-door, pitching.

44:14.297 --> 44:16.197
No dice. Then it came to me.

44:16.222 --> 44:18.701
I'm selling advertising...
why not advertise?

44:18.726 --> 44:19.787
And it worked.

44:19.812 --> 44:22.397
I mean, TV commercials get calls.

44:22.422 --> 44:24.088
What commercial did you run?

44:24.113 --> 44:26.556
Not... not "Gimme Jimmy"?

44:26.581 --> 44:29.916
No. I-I made a new one.

44:30.474 --> 44:32.303
W-When? [Chuckles]

44:32.328 --> 44:33.828
Today.

44:35.512 --> 44:37.936
- Right here.
- S-so you made a commercial...

44:37.961 --> 44:40.373
- for commercials today.
- Yeah.

44:40.398 --> 44:43.217
I'm starting to think
I might break even here.

44:43.242 --> 44:44.908
[Chuckles]

44:45.322 --> 44:47.756
O-okay. Let's see it.

44:47.791 --> 44:49.662
Eeeesh, I don't know.

44:50.127 --> 44:51.381
It's not my best work.

44:51.406 --> 44:54.506
It's, um, very last-minute.

44:54.531 --> 44:57.436
Well, you're getting
calls. It can't be that bad.

44:57.461 --> 44:59.364
Yeah.

44:59.436 --> 45:01.984
Wha... now you're getting shy?

45:02.009 --> 45:03.754
[Chuckles]

45:03.779 --> 45:05.440
- Come on.
- [Sighs]

45:06.162 --> 45:08.428
Okay, but keep in mind...

45:08.490 --> 45:10.733
Yeah, it's... yeah,
it's not your best work.

45:10.758 --> 45:12.178
I got it.

45:12.759 --> 45:15.092
[VCR whirring]

45:16.687 --> 45:18.687
[Sighs]

45:19.738 --> 45:21.358
[VCR clicks]

45:25.608 --> 45:26.974
[Beep]

45:26.999 --> 45:28.466
What's that I see?

45:28.491 --> 45:30.365
Albuquerque's next TV star?

45:30.413 --> 45:32.373
It's you, small-business owner!

45:32.398 --> 45:34.975
Struggling to make it in
today's fast-paced economy?

45:35.000 --> 45:37.756
Thought television advertising
was too expensive for you?

45:37.781 --> 45:39.280
Well, you better think again!

45:39.305 --> 45:42.172
You can't afford not to be on TV!

45:42.197 --> 45:44.564
Look at you... you're a triple threat!

45:44.589 --> 45:48.491
Great services, great products,
and most of all, that face!

45:48.516 --> 45:49.959
You're a star!

45:49.984 --> 45:52.950
Wrap it all up in your
natural charisma, and bam!

45:52.975 --> 45:54.801
You belong on TV!

45:54.826 --> 45:57.827
Better watch out for
autograph hounds and paparazzi!

45:57.852 --> 45:59.285
- [Ding!]
- And it gets better!

45:59.310 --> 46:00.943
I can have you on the air tomorrow.

46:00.968 --> 46:02.935
You heard me right... tomorrow!

46:02.960 --> 46:05.494
Better get ready to
be famous, Albuquerque!

46:05.519 --> 46:08.554
I can make you a TV star
for a price you can afford!

46:08.579 --> 46:10.365
Call me, Saul Goodman!

46:10.390 --> 46:13.123
The world needs to know
about you and your business!

46:13.148 --> 46:15.148
[Echoing] Call me now!

46:17.600 --> 46:18.789
[Sighs]

46:18.814 --> 46:19.896
The guy at the station said

46:19.922 --> 46:22.490
he's never seen so many
star wipes in a row.

46:22.515 --> 46:24.654
[Clicks tongue] It's never been done.

46:26.824 --> 46:29.045
- "Saul Goodman."
- Yeah.

46:29.070 --> 46:31.437
It's like, "S'all good, man." [Chuckles]

46:31.462 --> 46:33.428
That guy has a lot of energy.

46:33.453 --> 46:34.819
Yeah.

46:35.084 --> 46:36.917
It's just a name.

46:39.105 --> 46:40.872
[Sighs]

46:40.897 --> 46:42.436
Huh.
