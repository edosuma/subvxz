00:06.339 --> 00:09.467
MARGE: And here's a marble
for Lisa for cleaning her room,

00:09.551 --> 00:12.554
and a marble for Bart
for not trashing Lisa's room.

00:12.637 --> 00:14.097
The jars are full,

00:14.180 --> 00:17.475
so you've earned
your Saturday Surprise Dad Day!

00:17.559 --> 00:18.727
BOTH: Yay!

00:18.810 --> 00:22.188
This Saturday, from the dad
who brought you cemetery paintball

00:22.272 --> 00:24.232
and go-karts on real roads,

00:24.315 --> 00:26.568
comes the greatest activity yet...

00:27.944 --> 00:30.572
BOTH: Video game convention!

00:30.655 --> 00:32.824
-(cameras clicking)
-(murmuring)

00:34.909 --> 00:37.162
(crowd gasps)

00:37.245 --> 00:38.955
(crowd cheering)

00:39.039 --> 00:40.457
And check these out.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.333
BOTH: VIP passes!

00:42.417 --> 00:44.753
Is there any better feeling
than cutting in line

00:44.836 --> 00:47.839
because a plastic badge
says you're special?

00:47.922 --> 00:49.507
(drools)

00:49.591 --> 00:52.719
(Bart and Lisa drool)

00:52.802 --> 00:54.554
(all gasp)

00:54.637 --> 00:57.307
-BART: GTS!
-HOMER: So many games.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.017
-LISA: Ah.
-HOMER: Wow.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.727
BART: Whoa.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.771
(gasps) W.O.K.?!

01:02.854 --> 01:04.898
HOMER: Ooh, the Flying Tomato.

01:04.981 --> 01:06.941
BART: Ah! TMTOLO!

01:07.025 --> 01:08.568
DL2L-to-D!

01:08.651 --> 01:11.571
Oh! ACSOL! HC1?!

01:11.654 --> 01:12.739
Whoa!

01:12.822 --> 01:15.492
Guts of War Two:
Entrails of Intestinox!

01:17.911 --> 01:20.038
Colon slash!

01:20.121 --> 01:21.414
Rectum kill!

01:21.498 --> 01:23.917
We've made a game
that'll reward the hardcore gamer

01:24.000 --> 01:26.086
with hundreds and hundreds of hours of--

01:26.169 --> 01:28.004
-Finished it.
-Huh?

01:28.088 --> 01:30.423
(fanfare plays)

01:30.507 --> 01:32.759
But working on this game
cost me my marriage.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.803
I-I have twins I've never met!

01:34.886 --> 01:38.264
Well, when you meet them,
tell them your game's too easy.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.895
This game has all the best
college marching bands.

01:43.978 --> 01:46.356
From the precision footwork
of Ohio State

01:46.439 --> 01:49.526
to the lame,
dead-on-arrival humor of Stanford.

01:49.609 --> 01:52.112
-(crowd cheering on game)
-("Stars and Stripes Forever" playing)

01:52.195 --> 01:54.489
Uh-oh, I'm losing the crowd!

02:01.830 --> 02:02.956
(giggles)

02:03.039 --> 02:05.542
This is the funnest game ever!

02:06.417 --> 02:09.504
Man, how many quarters
does this game take?

02:09.587 --> 02:13.216
Dad! Funtendo is unveiling
their new system in three minutes,

02:13.299 --> 02:14.676
in Hall G!

02:14.759 --> 02:16.386
And we're in Hall D.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.139
Three halls, three minutes.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.308
No problem.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.982
-HOMER: Out of my way! Move it!
-(people screaming)

02:29.065 --> 02:31.568

Aha!

Whoo-hoo!

-(tires screech)

02:54.966 --> 02:56.342
Conventions rock!

02:56.426 --> 02:57.635
Fun Dad rocks!

02:57.719 --> 02:59.095
I need a nap!

02:59.179 --> 03:00.680
(Bart and Lisa laugh)

03:00.763 --> 03:02.724
You kids have had a big day.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.310
Head up to the tub
while I deflate your toys.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.520
Save us, Fun Dad!

03:07.604 --> 03:08.813
(laughter)

03:08.897 --> 03:10.815
(Rod and Todd grunt happily)

03:14.652 --> 03:17.447
The kids sure had
a good time with you.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.241
Yeah, I was on today.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.410
Scary on.

03:22.493 --> 03:24.829
How come they never
call me Fun Mom?

03:24.913 --> 03:27.373
Look, honey,
a family's like a team.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.919
And on every team,
you have the slam-dunking megastar

03:31.002 --> 03:33.004
and the referee.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.255
It's not fair.

03:34.339 --> 03:38.843
Moms want to be fun,
but we're stuck with all the mom stuff.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.512
Okay, okay, how about this--

03:41.596 --> 03:45.642
next week, you take the kids
on a Saturday Surprise Dad Day.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.310
What if...

03:47.393 --> 03:50.939
we roll pennies
and go to the dollar store?

03:51.022 --> 03:52.273
That's good, Marge!

03:52.357 --> 03:54.859
Get all the terrible ideas
out of your system.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.361
Oh.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.863
I've got it!

03:58.947 --> 04:03.117
Your Saturday Surprise Mom Day
is the X-Games!

04:03.201 --> 04:05.411
BOTH: Yay! X-Games! X-Games!

04:05.495 --> 04:07.455
All right!

04:08.790 --> 04:09.958
That isn't an "X," Mom.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.377
Welcome to the Cross Games, Simpsons.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.379
A Christian fellowship expo!

04:14.462 --> 04:16.047
Are there at least games here?

04:16.130 --> 04:17.590
Oh, no, "games" stands for

04:17.674 --> 04:20.927
Gathering of American Messengers
for Evangelical Sports.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.387
-Sports?
-(chuckles)

04:22.470 --> 04:26.015
"Sports" stands for Strict Parental
Oversight Rather Than Sports.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.268
(both groan)

04:28.977 --> 04:32.021
Come on, kids,
fun comes from inside.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.148
It isn't about what we actually do.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.484
Yes, it is! That's all it is!

04:36.567 --> 04:38.820
You're right, you're right, you're right.
Let's go.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.280
Thank the Lord!

04:40.363 --> 04:45.243
Two children to play debtors
in the Parable of the Unjust Steward.

04:45.326 --> 04:48.204
All the other kids are at
something called the X-Games.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.957
(Bart and Lisa groan)

04:52.959 --> 04:55.962
I'm sorry, gang. I blew it.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.631
(groans) I hate it
when grown-ups call kids "gang."

04:58.715 --> 05:00.133
Don't worry about it, Mom.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.969
Dad will take us
on a great outing next weekend.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.846
(sighs)

05:04.929 --> 05:06.556
(engine clanks, rattles)

05:06.639 --> 05:10.977
Why do old squirrels
always crawl into my engine to die?

05:11.060 --> 05:12.645
(groans)

05:12.729 --> 05:15.815
Guess we'll be making
an unscheduled pit stop, gang.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.734
We're not a gang!
Gangs are cool!

05:17.817 --> 05:19.360
(tires screech)

05:20.945 --> 05:23.823
-Uh, Mom, where are we?
-Nowhere scary.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.702
(engine hissing)

05:27.785 --> 05:29.370
Everything's fine.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.789
We'll just wait here
for the tow truck.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.377
That newborn has earrings!

05:40.715 --> 05:44.093
-Mom, we're hungry.
-(groans)

05:44.177 --> 05:48.222
I guess we could make a sprint
for one of these local establishments.

05:50.099 --> 05:53.311
(Marge groaning)

05:55.980 --> 05:58.775
They're using pancakes as spoons.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.027
Ooh, let's see what else
they do wrong.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.241
(groaning)

06:07.325 --> 06:09.577
Ew! Ugh!

06:10.411 --> 06:13.247
They're selling CDs in the restaurant!

06:13.331 --> 06:16.042
-Back to the car!
-What can I get you?

06:16.125 --> 06:18.669
Oh, I'll just have a side salad.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.797
We have no side salad.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.882
-Back to the car!
-Relax, Mom.

06:22.965 --> 06:25.301
-Be adventurous.
-Yeah, just have fun.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.969
Dad would.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.639
(sighs)

06:29.722 --> 06:31.599
What's the craziest thing on the menu?

06:31.682 --> 06:33.893
(chuckles)
She means the most authentic.

06:33.976 --> 06:36.062
Well, that would be

06:36.145 --> 06:37.897
the Zelzel Minchet Aletcha Wat.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.484
-Then I'll have that!
-(all gasp)

06:44.070 --> 06:47.698
Okay, Marge, you test-drove
a convertible once, you can do this.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.081
(lively Ethiopian music playing)

06:55.164 --> 06:57.417
(taste buds gasping,
murmuring excitedly)

07:00.878 --> 07:03.172
Holy casserole-y!

07:03.256 --> 07:04.715
That's good gloop!

07:05.633 --> 07:06.884
Mmm. Mmm.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.636
I wish I lived in Ethiopia!

07:10.763 --> 07:12.682
Exotic, vegetarian,

07:12.765 --> 07:14.809
I can mention it in a college essay.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.019
Mom, this is amazing!

07:17.103 --> 07:19.188
(all chewing noisily)

07:19.272 --> 07:21.190
Wait, wait, wait,
what is she eating?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.817
They've never served me that dish,

07:22.900 --> 07:24.986
and I wear indigenous
beaded headgear.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.237
Oh, this?

07:26.320 --> 07:28.906
It's just a little
Zelzel Minchet Aletcha Wat.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.241
It's all I ever eat here.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.536
(gasps)
They have prepared her a dish

07:33.619 --> 07:37.248
-from the non-translated page!
-(gasps)

07:37.331 --> 07:39.417
So grab a pancake
and slurp some slop!

07:39.500 --> 07:41.836
Foodies, heed my call!

07:41.919 --> 07:44.255
Commence ripping and dipping!

07:45.506 --> 07:47.842
(all chewing noisily)

07:47.925 --> 07:50.344
So, did all of your cars break down?

07:50.428 --> 07:53.764
Mom, they're here on purpose.
They're foodies.

07:53.848 --> 07:57.435
Indeed. Our passion is to seek out
interesting foods,

07:57.518 --> 07:59.937
savor their exotic flavors,
then blog about them.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.606
Yes.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.025
We discovered Korean barbecue
in this town.

08:04.108 --> 08:06.444
Uh, before the Koreans?

08:06.527 --> 08:08.946
Oh, sure they cook it,
but they don't get it.

08:09.030 --> 08:13.242
"When you stick a pancake into
a friend's mouth, it's a goorsha."

08:13.326 --> 08:15.203
Everybody goorsha!

08:15.286 --> 08:16.913
ALL: Goorsha!

08:16.996 --> 08:18.331
BART and LISA: Goorsha!
Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha!

08:18.414 --> 08:20.041
-Goorsha! Goorsha!
-Goorsha! Goorsha!

08:20.124 --> 08:22.835
-Goorsha!
-Marge, the kids are acting ethnic!

08:22.919 --> 08:24.462
Relax, Homie.

08:24.545 --> 08:27.507
Have some leftover
Galalalalalalalalah.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.883
(grunting)

08:30.551 --> 08:32.011
Oh, no.

08:32.094 --> 08:35.264
I don't eat anything new
unless I've eaten it before.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.266
Aw, come on, Dad, be a foodie.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.101
You're already a fatty and a drunkie.

08:39.185 --> 08:42.104
I don't want to think about food,
I want to like it.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.898
Why drive across town

08:43.981 --> 08:46.776
to savor a bowl of mystery mush

08:46.859 --> 08:48.778
when there's four different
Krusty Burgers

08:48.861 --> 08:50.488
we can see from our house?

08:50.571 --> 08:53.574
Oh, and here's my favorite restaurant--

08:53.658 --> 08:55.034
La Fridge.

08:55.117 --> 08:58.621
It's open 24 hours a day
and there's no dress code.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.252
What kind of American man

09:04.335 --> 09:06.504
doesn't want to explore
global food culture?

09:06.587 --> 09:08.297
And then brag about it
on the Internet.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.800
We should start our own food blog.

09:10.883 --> 09:14.762
(gasps)
The Three Mouthketeers.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.264
Three?

09:16.347 --> 09:19.183
You mean, one, two... me?

10:35.134 --> 10:36.636
People are loving our list

10:36.719 --> 10:39.555
of Springfield's top 99
Afghan restaurants.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.266
I feel bad for all those places
that didn't make the cut.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.269
All right, food nerds, reality check.

10:45.353 --> 10:48.689
All the food in those pictures
is poop by now.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.651
Minds blown, you're welcome.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.235
Oh.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.905
I'll remind you kids what real fun is.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.616
<i>Hey, hey, kids! (laughs)</i>

10:58.699 --> 11:00.409
<i>Krustyland has a new ride.</i>

11:00.493 --> 11:01.994
<i>The Eyeballs of Death.</i>

11:02.078 --> 11:04.789
<i>It only passed the safety panel</i>
<i>by a three-to-two vote.</i>

11:04.872 --> 11:06.999
<i>And that third vote didn't come cheap.</i>

11:07.083 --> 11:08.668
<i>(laughs)</i>

11:08.751 --> 11:12.088
And I've got tickets
for the grand opening Saturday night.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.507
-Whoa!
-(gasps) Cool.

11:14.590 --> 11:18.594
Uh, kids, don't forget about
our special plans Saturday night.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.429
Oh, sorry, Dad.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.682
Our blog is so popular,
we got an invitation

11:22.765 --> 11:25.351
to the most exclusive restaurant in town.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.269
Kent Brockman himself

11:27.353 --> 11:30.690
could only get a reservation
at 5:30 or 9:30.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.234
(giggles)
It's called El Chemistri,

11:33.317 --> 11:35.695
and they use science
to make the food.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.783
<i>Behold... pine needle sorbet.</i>

11:40.866 --> 11:43.619
(moaning)

11:43.703 --> 11:46.122
Pine needle... sorbet?

11:46.205 --> 11:48.541
Pine needle sorbet?

11:48.624 --> 11:52.169
My kids do not eat sorbet--
they eat sherbet.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.713
And they pronounce it "sherbert,"

11:53.796 --> 11:55.548
and they wish it was ice cream.

11:55.631 --> 11:58.134
Sorry, Dad,
this is our thing now.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.010
Fine, blow off Fun Dad

12:00.094 --> 12:03.639
and go eat your walrus mustaches
and deep-fried pixie wangs.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.227
Don't be so jealous, Homie,

12:08.310 --> 12:11.731
just because the kids are finally
having fun doing something with me.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.316
Aah! Jealous? Me?

12:14.400 --> 12:15.693
(chortles)

12:15.776 --> 12:17.987
That is to laugh.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.697
The very idea.

12:19.780 --> 12:23.701
If anything... (laughs)

12:23.784 --> 12:26.328
-you're the one who's jealous.
-Of what?

12:26.412 --> 12:29.331
Of how much fun
I am to be around!

12:29.415 --> 12:31.709
(sobs)

12:31.792 --> 12:33.836
It's always a party

12:33.919 --> 12:36.130
with Fun Dad!

12:36.213 --> 12:38.174
(sobbing)

12:41.177 --> 12:43.888
Too sad to walk.

12:43.971 --> 12:47.933
Too sad and fun to walk.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.734
-What are you doing?
-When I'm sad,

12:56.817 --> 12:58.944
I make baseball bats.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.615
Homie,
I don't want you to feel excluded.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.785
Would you like to come with us
to dinner at El Chemistri?

13:06.660 --> 13:09.497
Really?
You'd let me in on your thing?

13:09.580 --> 13:12.082
Even though I think it's stupid?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.626
Of course.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.878
-Hand me that saw, Marge.
-Why?

13:15.961 --> 13:18.422
When I'm happy,
I make birdhouses.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.509
Kids, guess what.
Mom invited me to your fancy dinner.

13:21.592 --> 13:22.927
-Cool.
-Awesome!

13:23.010 --> 13:25.554
I guess Fun Dad is a foodie now.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.224
BOTH:
Food Dad! Food Dad! Food Dad!

13:28.307 --> 13:29.809
(groans)

13:31.143 --> 13:33.145
(groaning)

13:34.688 --> 13:36.482
I'm food bad boy Tony Bourdain.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.984
There's nowhere I won't go
and nothing I won't eat,

13:39.068 --> 13:40.611
as long as I'm paid in emeralds

13:40.694 --> 13:43.531
and my hotel room has a bidet
that shoots warm champagne.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.491
I'm here at a Singapore
street-food market

13:45.574 --> 13:48.410
with famous blogging family,
the Three Mouthketeers.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.956
Marge, you've got to try
some of this hang hir kuay chap.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.917
Ooh, triple spicy barbecued stingray

13:55.000 --> 13:57.086
stuffed with pig organs.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.213
Fun Dad is a foodie now!

13:59.296 --> 14:01.131
(munching loudly)

14:01.215 --> 14:02.299
(swallows)

14:02.383 --> 14:05.302
This is my thing
and always will be.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.930
(munching loudly)

14:08.013 --> 14:11.350
Food Dad! Food Dad! Food Dad!

14:15.563 --> 14:17.398
Everything's more fun with Homer.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.859
(speaking faux Swedish)

14:28.367 --> 14:30.536
But this was all I had.

14:30.619 --> 14:33.289
BRITISH MAN:
Stop your bloody whinging, Marge.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.124
Aah! Gordon Ramsay!

14:35.207 --> 14:37.334
You (bleep) it up,
big blue, didn't you?

14:37.418 --> 14:40.379
Why did you invite Homer?
He stole your bloody thunder.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.632
You're not as (bleep) fun as him,
and you never will be.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.384
(crying)

14:45.467 --> 14:48.137
Darling, darling, crying's not fun.
Homer's fun.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.056
-Now, get out of my dream.
-It's my dream.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.559
Not anymore it's not.
Ramsay, awake.

14:54.351 --> 14:56.228
What in the hell was that?

14:56.312 --> 14:59.106
(gasps, sighs)

14:59.189 --> 15:02.484
Fun me. Fun me. Fun me.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.237
Kids, I was thinking,
was it really such a great idea

15:05.321 --> 15:07.072
to invite your father to that dinner?

15:07.156 --> 15:09.950
Relax.
Dad will be the life of the party.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.744
He'll be the fourth Mouthketeer.

15:11.827 --> 15:14.330
But there weren't four Musketeers.

15:14.413 --> 15:18.167
Yeah-huh. Athos, Porthos,
Aramis, and d'Artagnan.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.836
D'Artagnan wasn't a Musketeer.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.673
He only had a letter of introduction
to the captain of the guards--

15:24.757 --> 15:26.592
which he lost!

15:27.676 --> 15:30.012
You know, I'm pretty excited
about this far-out dinner.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.264
-Maybe I'll like it.
-Oh, I doubt it.

15:32.348 --> 15:35.017
You sit at communal tables
full of hipsters.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.810
Well, actually,
I've come around on hipsters.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.188
Takes a lot of guts
to all wear the same hat.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.565
And the food
will all be weird foams--

15:41.649 --> 15:44.193
cooked with chemicals
or served in a test tube.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.861
It's too crazy for you.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.614
So it's weird.
Don't worry, I'll make it fun.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.950
Yeah, you always do.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.035
Well, here's where to meet us.

15:53.118 --> 15:56.080
1501 W...

15:56.163 --> 15:58.290
East Oak Street.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.376
East Oak Street. Is that it?

16:00.459 --> 16:02.086
Uh... yes.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.754
Yes, East Oak Street.

16:03.837 --> 16:06.507
That's where you should go.
See you there.

16:07.257 --> 16:09.176
Don't you judge me.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.054
Ah, save it for the sitter.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.641
Welcome to El Chemistri.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.935
Pease place these mints
in your mouth,

16:18.018 --> 16:20.729
and when your table is ready,
they will vibrate.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.816
Ooh.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.654
(dog howling)

16:28.737 --> 16:31.031
Here it is-- 1501 East Oak.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.826
No name on the door--
very trendy.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.787
What do you want?

16:36.870 --> 16:39.623
Is this the chemical kitchen place
where you do the crazy cooking?

16:39.707 --> 16:41.125
Quiet, man.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.377
The experience begins.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.213
Where's Dad?

16:46.296 --> 16:48.424
Uh... I don't know.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.259
Probably changed his mind

16:50.342 --> 16:51.969
and stopped off for doughnuts.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.721
(chuckles)

16:55.305 --> 16:58.809
Before you is
a deconstructed Caesar salad--

16:58.892 --> 17:01.395
romaine lettuce gel, egg yolk ice,

17:01.478 --> 17:03.939
crouton foam, and anchovy air.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.399
You eat it like this--

17:05.482 --> 17:08.485
gel, ice, foam, air,
foam, ice, gel, foam, air.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.700
Just like Marge said--
chemicals and test tubes.

17:14.783 --> 17:16.535
The open kitchen is a nice touch.

17:16.618 --> 17:19.079
I guess I'll get started
before my family gets here.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.874
How much for a taste?
You know, just to get me going.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.667
-50 bucks.
-Ouch.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.794
This place is fancy.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.963
The next course is Regret.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.012
(delighted moans)

17:36.138 --> 17:37.890
(moaning)

17:37.973 --> 17:40.017
(chuckling) Hipsters.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.977
Too cool for school.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.313
You don't look like
the kind of guy who does this.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.690
Well, my wife thinks
it's too crazy for me,

17:46.774 --> 17:48.734
but I'm going to prove her wrong.

17:48.817 --> 17:51.987
(chuckles)
I'm doing this for my family.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.998
All right, Breaking Baddies,
drop the meth.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.335
Pick up the meth!
Pick up the meth!

18:06.418 --> 18:09.505
(gasps)
This better be dinner theater!

18:09.588 --> 18:12.716
And now, pork chops 100 ways.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.927
(diners oohing)

18:16.678 --> 18:18.639
100 pork chops!

18:18.722 --> 18:20.849
I can't believe Dad is missing this.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.144
Sure, your dad's great,
but I'm fun, too.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.854
Look at me eat, huh?

18:25.938 --> 18:28.190
(munching loudly)
D'oh. D'oh. D'oh.

18:29.858 --> 18:32.694
Who am I kidding?
I'm not enjoying this.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.072
Even the foam tastes like nothing.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.865
(sighs)
I'm calling Homer.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.325
(cell phone chimes)

18:38.408 --> 18:40.702
<i>HOMER (on phone):</i>
<i>Marge! This isn't a food restaurant!</i>

18:40.786 --> 18:42.746
<i>-It's a meth restaurant!</i>
<i>-(gunshots)</i>

18:42.830 --> 18:45.290
<i>A meth-taurant! Aah!</i>

18:45.374 --> 18:47.709
(gasps)
Foodies, help me!

18:47.793 --> 18:49.128
My husband's in danger!

18:49.211 --> 18:52.256
-Oh, we can't leave now.
-We haven't had the root vegetables

18:52.339 --> 18:54.716
cooked in the perfect vacuum
of outer space.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.344
They say you can't even
understand parsnips

18:57.427 --> 18:59.471
until you had zero-g parsnips.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.390
(groans)

19:01.473 --> 19:03.600
How dare you walk out on me!

19:03.684 --> 19:05.853
Your dessert is in this doggie bag

19:05.936 --> 19:09.231
woven from the silk of
a blueberry-fed spider.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.316
Take it and go!

19:11.400 --> 19:13.277
-(sirens whooping)
-(police radio chatter)

19:13.360 --> 19:14.695
Ah, shucks.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.823
We get the family dressed up
to go to our favorite meth lab,

19:17.906 --> 19:19.741
and it's all raided out.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.077
-(children groan)
-Oh, honey,

19:22.161 --> 19:25.164
I always liked
your home-cooked better anyways.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.540
Aw.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.876
Uh, where do you think
you're going?

19:28.959 --> 19:32.045
A wife needs to tell her husband
she was wrong.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.964
And in you go.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.841
(whimpering)

19:35.924 --> 19:37.467
Sorry.

19:37.551 --> 19:40.220
Everything you've done here
has created problems.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.474
(grunts)

19:44.558 --> 19:46.101
(gasps)
I've got to save him.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.979
(gasps)
Ooh. My dessert.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.816
Eat deconstructed apple pie!

19:52.900 --> 19:54.067
(grunts)

19:54.151 --> 19:55.777
(swallows)

19:55.861 --> 19:57.404
(sighs)

20:02.534 --> 20:05.454
<i>Merci, Maman,</i>
<i>pour la tarte tatin à la mode.</i>

20:10.292 --> 20:11.543
(sighs)

20:15.547 --> 20:16.798
Oh, Marge,

20:16.882 --> 20:19.760
you saved me
from the danger you put me in.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.638
I am so happy and angry.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.223
I'm sorry.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.433
I guess I just wanted
the kids to look at me

20:26.516 --> 20:28.894
-the way they look at you.
-Aw.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.521
Wow, Mom!
That was awesome.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.273
We ate mad-scientist food

20:33.357 --> 20:35.901
and broke up a meth lab
in the same day.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.737
Fun Mom! Fun Mom! Fun Mom!

20:43.784 --> 20:45.535
Now, that's my kind of foam.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.120
This is nice.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.248
A family fun day.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.624
Here's 50 bucks.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.502
For the next two hours,
I don't want to know you exist.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.003
(laughing)

20:55.087 --> 20:57.130
Family fun day.
