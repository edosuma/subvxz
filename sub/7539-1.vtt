for the path to glory ¶

00:21.486 --> 00:26.621

00:26.623 --> 00:31.359

the harder they fall ¶

00:31.361 --> 00:35.763

Hey!

02:26.590 --> 02:27.488
¶ Let it ride ¶

02:27.490 --> 02:29.490
oh-ho.

02:31.694 --> 02:33.193
Vroom!

02:33.195 --> 02:37.297

let it ride, let it ride. ¶

03:00.918 --> 03:02.217
Yeah!

03:08.891 --> 03:12.325
Man: The country bears
officially broke up

03:12.327 --> 03:15.227
after the '91 hibernation tour.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.762
It's actually hard to imagine
popular music without the bears.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.296
I learned a lot from those guys

03:19.298 --> 03:20.597
and that was why I was so sad

03:20.599 --> 03:21.731
to see them break up.

03:21.733 --> 03:24.500
Fred:
I guess I miss the old days

03:24.502 --> 03:26.502
at country bear hall.

03:26.504 --> 03:27.803
We was kinda...

03:27.805 --> 03:29.671
Different, you see?

03:29.673 --> 03:31.572
And, uh, at country bear hall

03:31.574 --> 03:34.274
you could be different
and still fit in.

03:34.276 --> 03:36.809
Yup. Different. Mm-hmm.

03:36.811 --> 03:40.512
Boy: Hey, beary.

03:40.514 --> 03:43.348
Doofus, it's time for dinner.

03:52.792 --> 03:53.824
Dad: Sit down, Dex.

03:53.826 --> 03:55.492
Okay, that's enough,
that's enough.

03:55.494 --> 03:56.759
Napkin's not a toy, Dex.

03:56.761 --> 03:57.960
I'm really not that hungry.

03:57.962 --> 03:59.561
Mom?

03:59.563 --> 04:01.296
Am I adopted?

04:01.298 --> 04:05.466
Well... of course not, honey.

04:05.468 --> 04:06.600
Eat your fish.

04:06.602 --> 04:07.801
Yes, you are.

04:07.803 --> 04:09.836
Um... why would you
think that, beary?

04:09.838 --> 04:11.470
I don't know.

04:11.472 --> 04:14.406
Sometimes I feel... Different.

04:14.408 --> 04:15.707
Like Dex and me.

04:15.709 --> 04:17.675
We don't look the same.

04:17.677 --> 04:19.576
Our eyes are different colors

04:19.577 --> 04:22.779
and he has freckles,
and I don't.

04:22.781 --> 04:23.946
I think.

04:23.948 --> 04:24.746
Are you serious?

04:24.748 --> 04:25.747
That's why you think

04:25.749 --> 04:26.581
you're different?

04:26.583 --> 04:27.782
Dad: You know, um...

04:27.784 --> 04:31.752
Last week it was "casual
Friday" at the office

04:31.754 --> 04:33.820
and I guess I forgot

04:33.822 --> 04:36.422
and I wore a tie.

04:37.558 --> 04:38.690
And boy...

04:38.692 --> 04:40.892
Did I feel different!

04:40.894 --> 04:42.360
It was...

04:42.362 --> 04:43.561
Yeah.

04:43.563 --> 04:44.795
The point is

04:44.797 --> 04:48.431
that it's not unusual
to feel different

04:48.433 --> 04:49.832
and...

04:49.834 --> 04:52.334
Those differences
always lead us

04:52.336 --> 04:53.835
to our higher purpose.

04:53.837 --> 04:55.503
Higher purpose?

04:55.505 --> 04:58.272
Honey, even if you were adopted

04:58.274 --> 05:01.441
we would love you
as much as we love Dexter.

05:01.443 --> 05:02.508
Maybe more.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.610
Just remember, son

05:04.612 --> 05:07.412
the people who love
you no matter what...

05:07.414 --> 05:08.646
That's your family.

05:08.648 --> 05:11.749
Okay.

05:11.751 --> 05:13.484
I'm going to go practice.

05:13.486 --> 05:14.618
Did you know

05:14.620 --> 05:16.886
the bears made
the only country song

05:16.888 --> 05:18.921
ever go be recorded in Polish?!

05:18.923 --> 05:20.255
Whoa! Really?!

05:20.257 --> 05:22.624
And did you know
that nobody cares?

05:29.932 --> 05:31.331
Way to go, doofus.

05:31.333 --> 05:32.565
You're, like, totally wrecking

05:32.567 --> 05:33.999
this family.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.300
Um, what are you talking about?

05:37.637 --> 05:39.803
You really want to know
what I'm talking about?

05:43.642 --> 05:47.543
Okay, this is my baby picture.

05:47.545 --> 05:48.544
This is yours.

05:48.546 --> 05:49.545
Yeah?

05:49.547 --> 05:50.846
See this?

05:50.848 --> 05:52.948
This is my birth certificate.

05:52.950 --> 05:54.349
Here's yours.

05:54.351 --> 05:57.685
The rangers used this
to track you.

06:01.290 --> 06:03.757
So... what's your point?

06:06.560 --> 06:07.792
Forget it.

06:08.895 --> 06:10.294
That?

06:10.296 --> 06:12.529
That's the day
mom and dad got you.

06:12.531 --> 06:13.897
What do you mean...

06:13.899 --> 06:14.964
"Got me"?

06:14.966 --> 06:16.699
I mean, picked you up, man.

06:16.701 --> 06:17.900
You were left alone.

06:17.902 --> 06:20.969
They brought you home,
they showed you

06:20.971 --> 06:22.470
a bunch of Barney videos

06:22.472 --> 06:24.638
and they pretended
you were their son.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.641
You don't belong here.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.626
At country bear hall

06:51.628 --> 06:56.730
you could be different
and still fit in.

06:56.732 --> 06:59.032
Yup. Different.

07:29.362 --> 07:34.631
¶ Sometimes
it's just the goin' ¶

07:34.633 --> 07:36.766
¶ you've got to go ¶

07:36.768 --> 07:43.638
¶ and you don't even know
if it's the right thing to do ¶

07:43.640 --> 07:48.975
¶ nobody else can be showin' ¶

07:48.977 --> 07:51.978
¶ which way to go ¶

07:51.980 --> 07:55.815
¶ and you're not even sure
of where you're goin' to ¶

07:55.817 --> 07:58.417
¶ but it's a start ¶

07:59.787 --> 08:03.688
¶ in your heart ¶

08:06.526 --> 08:10.961
¶ Sometimes
it's just the goin'... ¶

08:24.041 --> 08:27.475
Country bear hall!

08:29.912 --> 08:31.878
Wow!

08:38.085 --> 08:40.751
Whoa! Hey! Uh...

08:53.967 --> 08:56.434
Man: 25 cents?!

08:56.436 --> 08:58.169
Do you have change
for a hundred?

08:59.639 --> 09:01.071
Hello, Reed.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.939
I thought
you weren't coming back

09:02.941 --> 09:04.674
until you could
tear the place down.

09:04.676 --> 09:06.709
That's a whole
four days away, Henry.

09:06.711 --> 09:07.910
The people

09:07.912 --> 09:09.678
that owned the bank before you

09:09.680 --> 09:10.945
wouldn't mind

09:10.947 --> 09:13.180
if I got behind in my payments
a month or two.

09:13.182 --> 09:15.015
They'd cut me some slack.

09:15.017 --> 09:17.684
Uh-huh. How far behind
are you right now?

09:17.686 --> 09:20.286
Uh... six...

09:20.288 --> 09:21.720
Years.

09:21.722 --> 09:23.154
Six years?

09:23.156 --> 09:25.156
$20,000.

09:25.158 --> 09:26.323
Must be tough.

09:26.325 --> 09:28.191
You had a good run, Henry

09:28.193 --> 09:31.627
but good things must come
to an end, luckily.

09:31.629 --> 09:34.029
That also applies
to lame junkie things

09:34.031 --> 09:35.663
like country bear hall.

09:35.665 --> 09:37.865
Do you like the sound
of crunching wood?

09:37.867 --> 09:39.032
I do.

09:56.348 --> 09:59.682
Oh, like that's going to help.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.986
Brother...

10:21.338 --> 10:24.272
If you're going to stand there

10:24.274 --> 10:29.343
you might as well
give me a hand.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.212
What's that?

10:32.214 --> 10:35.048
A sign.

10:35.050 --> 10:39.085
Yeah, but... "Destroy"?

10:39.087 --> 10:40.753
Right.

10:40.755 --> 10:42.087
Well...

10:42.089 --> 10:43.855
They're going to tear down

10:43.857 --> 10:45.923
country bear hall.

10:45.925 --> 10:49.192
Tear down country bear hall?

10:49.194 --> 10:50.293
Yeah.

10:50.295 --> 10:53.195
Tear down country bear hall?!

10:53.197 --> 10:56.798
Uh...

10:56.800 --> 10:58.132
Yeah.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.272
Sir, officer hamm.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.840
And officer cheets.

11:07.842 --> 11:09.641
Hamm and cheets?

11:09.643 --> 11:10.742
Yeah.

11:10.744 --> 11:13.745
W-we get that all the time.

11:13.747 --> 11:15.246
Well, it's your name.

11:15.248 --> 11:16.747
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

11:21.753 --> 11:24.720
I thought you
officers might enjoy

11:24.722 --> 11:25.887
a little nibble of something.

11:25.889 --> 11:26.854
Ah...

11:26.856 --> 11:27.988
When I'm upset, I bake.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.326
Please help yourself!

11:37.396 --> 11:40.430
Okay, um... About your boy...

11:40.432 --> 11:43.666
Um, his name is beary.

11:43.668 --> 11:45.034
"B-a-r..."

11:45.036 --> 11:48.137
No, it's "b-e-a-r"

11:48.139 --> 11:49.738
like in...

11:49.740 --> 11:52.006
The German spelling
of the name.

11:53.109 --> 11:55.776
Oh, man, are you kidding me?!

11:57.713 --> 11:59.145
Don't worry, young buck.

11:59.147 --> 12:01.213
We'll find your
brother for you.

12:01.215 --> 12:02.280
Here now.

12:02.282 --> 12:03.414
There we go.

12:03.416 --> 12:06.016
Now you're an honorary deputy.

12:06.018 --> 12:07.283
Gee, thanks.

12:07.285 --> 12:09.184
I'm sure all the kids
on the playground

12:09.186 --> 12:10.385
will be really impressed.

12:10.387 --> 12:13.254
Yeah, well, don't
arrest anybody.

12:17.193 --> 12:20.427
Henry: <i>Yeah, this place would
fill up every weekend night.</i>

12:20.429 --> 12:22.061
Really?

12:22.063 --> 12:24.997
I tell you, a lot of great
music was on that stage.

12:24.999 --> 12:28.233
There's flat and scruggs,
liver lips McGraw, gomer.

12:28.235 --> 12:31.336
Jimi Hendrix opened here
for vanilla fudge.

12:31.338 --> 12:36.074
But nobody, but nobody was
like the country bears.

12:36.076 --> 12:39.744
Huh! Place would be packed...
people sitting everywhere

12:39.746 --> 12:42.079
even up in the rafters.

12:42.081 --> 12:43.280
You know, sometimes

12:43.282 --> 12:44.948
I'd climb up there
just to hear the notes.

12:44.950 --> 12:46.082
What notes?

12:46.084 --> 12:48.350
The music.

12:48.352 --> 12:51.786
The millions of notes
that floated up there...

12:51.788 --> 12:54.922
Some of the best
darn notes ever.

12:54.924 --> 12:57.257
Well, why don't you stop them

12:57.259 --> 13:00.760
before they start
to tear the place down?

13:00.762 --> 13:01.761
Why?

13:01.763 --> 13:03.996
$20,000, that's why.

13:03.998 --> 13:06.231
You don't got it,
I don't got it.

13:06.233 --> 13:09.334
Good-bye, country bear hall.

13:09.336 --> 13:11.336
I can't raise
that kind of cash.

13:11.338 --> 13:15.173
Four days from now, this
place comes a-tumbling down.

13:19.979 --> 13:22.212
Wait a minute.

13:22.214 --> 13:24.347
Wait a minute!

13:24.349 --> 13:27.116
I got it!

13:27.117 --> 13:29.884
I heard that some people
have a higher purpose in life.

13:29.887 --> 13:30.886
Well.

13:30.888 --> 13:32.087
I belong here.

13:32.089 --> 13:34.789
I belong here helping
you save this place.

13:34.791 --> 13:36.223
Nah.

13:36.225 --> 13:38.792
And we can do it with a
concert to raise the money.

13:38.794 --> 13:40.527
We can get the band
back together!

13:40.529 --> 13:41.828
Get the band back to...!

13:41.830 --> 13:42.829
Uh-huh.

13:42.831 --> 13:44.063
Get the... get the...!

13:44.065 --> 13:46.031
Oh, that's the stupidest thing.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.532
Never in a million years.

13:47.534 --> 13:49.800
But this place... it's historic.

13:49.802 --> 13:50.834
No.

13:50.836 --> 13:52.268
The notes in the rafters.

13:52.270 --> 13:53.369
No! I know they'll do it.

13:53.371 --> 13:55.070
Oh, come on now.
They could play a show.

13:55.072 --> 13:56.071
Now, stop it, okay?

13:56.073 --> 13:57.939
Just forget it. Stop it.

13:57.941 --> 13:59.040
But wait, you're not...

13:59.042 --> 14:00.808
I said stop!

14:02.344 --> 14:04.844
It's over.

14:04.846 --> 14:06.879
Uh...

14:07.848 --> 14:10.081
Dumb kid.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.082
Stupid idea.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.117
Get the band back together.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.319
You could do that.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.554
Oh, look, even if we
found them, uh...

14:17.556 --> 14:19.389
A concert?

14:19.391 --> 14:20.990
Yeah, you need equipment

14:20.992 --> 14:23.559
and tickets and promotion
and... everything.

14:23.561 --> 14:24.560
I don't know.

14:24.562 --> 14:26.461
I could do that.

14:26.463 --> 14:28.796
Oh, Al.

14:28.798 --> 14:30.397
Look, let's face it.

14:30.399 --> 14:33.032
In a week from now,
some teenager's

14:33.034 --> 14:36.902
going to be teaching us
how to operate a deep fryer.

14:36.904 --> 14:41.373
We could do that.

14:41.375 --> 14:43.975
Does he have
any distinguishing marks

14:43.977 --> 14:46.544
something that we can
recognize him by?

14:48.414 --> 14:50.013
Yeah.

14:50.015 --> 14:51.114
He's got thick brown hair...

14:51.116 --> 14:55.017
All over his body.

14:55.019 --> 14:59.454
Uh, you know, I think I may have
a recent photograph of him

14:59.456 --> 15:01.289
if-if that would help you out.

15:01.291 --> 15:04.191
Oh... he looks like a...

15:04.193 --> 15:05.225
Fourth grader?

15:05.227 --> 15:06.526
That's right. Yeah.

15:06.528 --> 15:08.160
Cutie pie.

15:10.931 --> 15:12.597
Okay, you know what?

15:12.599 --> 15:14.398
I'm going to go to my room now

15:14.400 --> 15:17.234
and, uh, I'm going to
stay there till I'm 18.

15:18.937 --> 15:21.470
Okay, we're all done here.

15:21.472 --> 15:22.971
Are you going to find him?

15:22.973 --> 15:26.140
Ma'am, we're going
to do more than that.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.175
How are we going
to do more than that?

15:28.177 --> 15:29.276
Huh?

15:29.278 --> 15:31.211
What are we going to do,
find him twice?

15:31.213 --> 15:32.212
All right.

15:32.214 --> 15:34.080
Let's get mobile.

15:36.150 --> 15:39.184
¶ There's a town down the road ¶

15:39.186 --> 15:43.188
¶ where I ain't been before ¶

15:45.925 --> 15:49.026
¶ Nobody knows my name ¶

15:49.028 --> 15:52.062
¶ or what I'm looking for ¶

15:54.266 --> 15:57.500
¶ Maybe things will be
a little different ¶

15:57.502 --> 16:01.070
¶ 'cause it can't
stay the same... ¶

16:03.474 --> 16:06.308
Beary: ¶ I'm gonna ease
on down the road ¶

16:06.310 --> 16:07.342
hmm?

16:07.344 --> 16:09.610
¶ Where nobody knows my name ¶

16:14.348 --> 16:17.982
¶ If they think about me
tonight ¶

16:17.984 --> 16:22.052
¶ I know
they won't miss the pain ¶

16:22.054 --> 16:26.456
¶ 'cause I'll be taking it
down the road ¶

16:26.458 --> 16:31.227
¶ where nobody knows my name ¶

16:31.229 --> 16:33.229
¶ yeah. ¶

16:33.231 --> 16:34.563

16:34.565 --> 16:35.564
Hey.

16:35.566 --> 16:38.199
Henry?

16:38.201 --> 16:42.136
Uh, well, if we're going
to get the band back together

16:42.138 --> 16:44.238
we're going to need
some transportation.

17:00.254 --> 17:01.653
Hey, beary, meet roadie.

17:01.655 --> 17:02.654
Hi.

17:02.656 --> 17:03.988
Have you seen my chicken?

17:03.990 --> 17:05.189
Uh, no.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.191
Big Al: Get off my grass.

17:08.928 --> 17:12.530
He was making a mess
on my grass.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.165
I'm sorry, big Al.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.165
Yeah.

17:16.167 --> 17:17.300
Peace.

17:17.301 --> 17:19.568
Henry: The original
country bear tour bus.

17:23.307 --> 17:24.339
Beary: Whoa.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.108
Wow.

17:29.445 --> 17:32.446
Henry:
Oh, yeah, pretty neat, huh?

17:32.448 --> 17:33.713
Beary: Uh-huh. Wow.

17:33.715 --> 17:35.181
Hey, uh...

17:35.183 --> 17:37.650
Get the place ready
for the concert, big Al.

17:37.652 --> 17:40.319
I'm counting on you.

17:40.321 --> 17:41.486
Let's hit it, roadie.

17:41.488 --> 17:42.520
Don't you worry

17:42.522 --> 17:44.755
about nothing, Henry.

17:44.757 --> 17:49.226
You just go get them boys.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.131
Oh, and be careful of my...

17:57.701 --> 17:59.734
Grass.

18:08.576 --> 18:10.809
¶ So you want to be
a rock 'n' roll star ¶

18:10.811 --> 18:14.646

to what I say ¶

18:14.648 --> 18:17.315
¶ just get an electric guitar ¶

18:17.317 --> 18:20.518
¶ and take some time
and learn how to play ¶

18:20.520 --> 18:24.722
¶ and in a week or two,
if you make the charts ¶

18:24.724 --> 18:26.356
¶ the girls
will tear you apart... ¶

18:26.358 --> 18:28.324
beary: So, is Fred still
in show business?

18:28.326 --> 18:31.694
Henry:
Yeah, you could say that.

18:31.696 --> 18:32.695
Hey, Fred.

18:32.697 --> 18:33.829
Morning.

18:33.831 --> 18:35.430
How's it going, Fred?

18:35.432 --> 18:36.563
Okay.

18:40.101 --> 18:41.333
Excuse me.

18:41.335 --> 18:43.101
Sorry, got to be part
of the video shoot.

18:43.103 --> 18:45.470

Oh, krystal, hey, sorry.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.246
Really? You play?

19:00.248 --> 19:01.814
Oh, yeah. I was a country...

19:04.585 --> 19:07.785

Wait, wait,

And didn't you invent
the stage dive?

19:18.796 --> 19:22.230
Oh, yeah, but I'm
too old for that now.

19:23.233 --> 19:24.398
You're not too old.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.799
You should play with us.

19:25.801 --> 19:27.734
Huh? Come on, Fred.

Come on.

Huh? Henry?

rip Holland, hen?

22:34.412 --> 22:35.544
Rip Holland?

So, are you nearby?

22:54.359 --> 22:57.727
Uh, the boys and I are putting

22:59.964 --> 23:02.698
Oh, I get it, I get it.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.466
You just called to gloat.

23:04.468 --> 23:05.700
Well, you listen to me...

23:05.702 --> 23:07.334
Oh, no, no, no, rip, rip, rip.

23:07.336 --> 23:08.535
I called...

23:10.988 --> 23:13.438
'Cause I thought we could put
aside the old stuff, and, uh...

23:13.441 --> 23:16.642
Well, I was hoping you could
promote the show.

23:16.644 --> 23:18.410
I don't know, but let me

23:18.412 --> 23:19.711
check my calendar.

23:24.649 --> 23:26.782
Well, it's going to be a squeeze

23:26.784 --> 23:29.384
but I think a little juggling

23:29.386 --> 23:31.386
I can fit it in.

23:31.388 --> 23:32.687
Well, that's great.

23:33.956 --> 23:36.056
Well, okay, this Saturday night
at 8:00, then.

23:36.058 --> 23:37.490
You got it, Henry.

23:39.026 --> 23:43.627
I am so back, baby!

23:43.629 --> 23:44.894
Excuse me, sir.

23:44.896 --> 23:46.562
This is the last time
I'm going to tell you.

23:46.564 --> 23:48.363
You're going to have
to leave the store.

23:48.365 --> 23:50.431
Yeah, right, like I need you.

23:51.834 --> 23:53.099
Do you know who I am?

23:53.101 --> 23:55.067
I'm rip Holland... rip Holland.

23:55.069 --> 23:56.068
That's ours.

23:56.070 --> 23:57.335
Right.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.940
Henry: You know, Fred, you were
the only one who ever wrote me.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.875
You know where
any of the other boys are?

24:04.877 --> 24:06.810
Fred:
Zeb never gave up the honey.

24:06.812 --> 24:08.913
Hangs out at a bar
in nuttville.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.188
Oh, that's a nice scrapbook
there, beary.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.523
Thanks.

24:20.525 --> 24:22.458
I've been working
on it forever.

24:23.794 --> 24:24.959
I really like

24:24.961 --> 24:26.193
this picture.

24:26.195 --> 24:28.061
You used to have a lot of hair.

24:28.063 --> 24:32.465
Uh... yeah, well...
Oh, look at this one.

24:32.467 --> 24:34.934
Winning that talent show
was our big break.

24:34.936 --> 24:36.568
What's an "arm musician"?

24:37.637 --> 24:38.902
That's Benny bogswaggle.

24:38.904 --> 24:41.437
He was real talented.

24:47.644 --> 24:49.043
But he was a bad loser.

24:49.045 --> 24:50.911
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:50.913 --> 24:53.713
He hit zeb with a chair.

24:59.853 --> 25:01.185
What's that?

25:01.187 --> 25:04.254
That there's a sign.

25:04.256 --> 25:06.556
I'm aware of that.

25:06.558 --> 25:09.525
"Reunion benefit concert."

25:09.527 --> 25:11.493
Uh, watch the grass.

25:11.495 --> 25:13.795
Where's Henry?

25:13.797 --> 25:16.898
In the bears bus,
picking up the band.

25:17.967 --> 25:20.734
You mean, he's...

25:20.736 --> 25:23.136
He's not actually serious.

25:23.138 --> 25:24.170
Oh, yeah.

25:24.172 --> 25:25.237
Even got

25:25.239 --> 25:27.072
rip Holland to promote it.

25:27.074 --> 25:29.207
Rip Holland? Really?

25:29.209 --> 25:30.708
You bet.

25:30.710 --> 25:31.709
Uh, come here.

25:32.678 --> 25:35.111
You see, Henry says

25:35.113 --> 25:38.514
we do this here concert,
and we raise

25:38.516 --> 25:40.782
that $20,000

25:40.784 --> 25:43.984
we could tell that
little weasel banker to, uh...

25:46.188 --> 25:47.854
Oops.

25:47.856 --> 25:49.255
Tell the weasel what?

25:49.257 --> 25:50.556
Uh...

25:50.558 --> 25:52.658
Uh, over yonder...

25:52.660 --> 25:53.992
a monkey.

25:56.162 --> 25:59.129
Hey.

25:59.131 --> 26:01.931
I'm chubby, but I'm quick.

26:07.304 --> 26:09.604
Rip Holland...

26:23.786 --> 26:25.786
¶ You told me, baby,
one more time ¶

26:25.788 --> 26:28.188
¶ you don't wanna sit
all alone and cry ¶

26:28.190 --> 26:30.557
¶ well, it's over ¶

26:30.559 --> 26:31.925
¶ I can't let go ¶

26:33.261 --> 26:35.160
¶ I'm like a fish out of water ¶

26:35.162 --> 26:36.561
¶ a cat in a tree ¶

26:36.563 --> 26:38.763
¶ you'll be the one
on top of me ¶

26:38.765 --> 26:41.766
¶ well, it's over ¶

26:41.768 --> 26:43.601
¶ I can't let go ¶

26:43.603 --> 26:46.670
¶ he won't play me back
when I come around... ¶

26:46.672 --> 26:49.005
this way.

26:49.007 --> 26:52.008
¶ I got a big chain
around my neck ¶

26:52.010 --> 26:54.210
¶ I'm rollin' down
like a train wreck...¶

26:54.212 --> 26:55.344
uh, excuse me, miss.

26:55.346 --> 26:57.646
Yeah?

26:57.648 --> 26:59.981
Uh, would you happen
to know if there's

26:59.983 --> 27:01.782
a zeb zoober here?

27:01.784 --> 27:03.116
Zeb zoober? Yeah.

27:03.118 --> 27:05.184
The zeb zoober
that sleeps on my floor?

27:05.186 --> 27:06.752
The zeb zoober
that owes me $500?

27:06.754 --> 27:11.222
The zeb zoober that won't stop
calling me cha-cha?

27:11.224 --> 27:13.123
Set me up, cha-cha!

27:14.092 --> 27:15.891
Sounds like him.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.325
Zeb zoober.

27:18.327 --> 27:20.727
I can't get rid of zeb zoober.

27:38.612 --> 27:40.345
Hey, there, zeb.

27:44.384 --> 27:46.117
Henry?

27:46.119 --> 27:48.119
Fred?

27:48.121 --> 27:50.254
Is that you?

27:50.256 --> 27:52.322
Now, come on, zeb,
what do you say?

27:52.324 --> 27:53.723
You give up the honey

27:53.725 --> 27:55.224
and come with us, hmm?

27:55.226 --> 27:59.027
Guys, even if I wanted
to leave town, I couldn't.

27:59.029 --> 28:02.030
I owe cha-cha over there
a lot of money.

28:02.032 --> 28:03.798
I'm hungry.

28:03.800 --> 28:06.000
Want to split an order
of salmon fingers?

28:06.002 --> 28:07.134
Oh, Fred.

28:07.136 --> 28:08.668
How about twigs and berries?

28:15.174 --> 28:16.773
Excuse me, ma'am.

28:16.775 --> 28:19.208
What's that boy doing?

28:19.210 --> 28:20.943
I don't know.

28:23.013 --> 28:24.946
Okay, it's a deal.

28:32.254 --> 28:35.755
You're zeb zoober.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.790
Yeah, well, that may be true
but, I-I...

28:38.893 --> 28:40.092
Who is this guy?

28:40.094 --> 28:41.726
Well, that's beary.

28:41.728 --> 28:43.027
Uh, ladies and gentlemen

28:43.029 --> 28:45.295
can I have your attention
here for a minute?

28:45.297 --> 28:47.797
Now, as most of you know

28:47.799 --> 28:51.967
zeb zoober owes me
a whole heap of money.

28:51.969 --> 28:54.302
But his little friend there

28:54.304 --> 28:55.903
has proposed a wager.

28:55.905 --> 28:58.105
My house band
versus zeb's fiddle

28:58.107 --> 28:59.906
in a little musical duel.

28:59.908 --> 29:02.308
Now, if he wins,
he owes me nothing

29:02.310 --> 29:06.779
but if he loses, I get to keep
the country bear tour bus.

29:06.781 --> 29:09.181
What? This should be good.

29:09.183 --> 29:12.784
Son, that bus is our only
means of transportation.

29:12.786 --> 29:14.986
Not to mention
that's where I raised my kids.

29:14.988 --> 29:16.087
Plus, I don't think

29:16.089 --> 29:19.056
you've all seen the house band.

29:24.830 --> 29:28.031
¶ Hey, there, bear, I know
you'd like a little honey ¶

29:28.033 --> 29:31.701
¶ but your credit's no good,
man, you're out of money ¶

29:31.703 --> 29:35.071
¶ I heard you can play
the fiddle with the best ¶

29:35.073 --> 29:38.908
¶ well, I'm here
a-puttin' you to the test ¶

29:38.910 --> 29:43.045
¶ I'm hereby challenging you
to a duel ¶

29:43.047 --> 29:44.312
¶ 'tween my guitar
and your fiddle ¶

29:44.314 --> 29:46.247
¶ you fuzzy fool ¶

29:59.327 --> 30:00.959
That's my guy.

30:00.961 --> 30:04.796
¶ Well, hey, there, mister,
that was pretty good ¶

30:04.798 --> 30:08.399
¶ for a local bartender
in the neighborhood ¶

30:08.401 --> 30:12.336
¶ well, I'm a little rusty, now,
I admit ¶

30:12.338 --> 30:16.173
¶ but I ain't afraid of you,
not one bit ¶

30:16.175 --> 30:20.377
¶ I hereby accept
your challenge to a duel ¶

30:20.379 --> 30:24.047
¶ your guitar and my fiddle,
you crazy fool ¶

30:24.049 --> 30:27.784
¶ I'm only in it for the honey ¶

30:27.786 --> 30:30.820
¶ it makes my head
feel kind of funny ¶

30:30.822 --> 30:35.257
¶ gimme that golden nectar
straight from the bees ¶

30:35.259 --> 30:38.927
¶ bartender, gimme some of that,
please ¶

30:43.966 --> 30:45.398
Yay!

30:48.836 --> 30:51.435
You better call a cab.

30:53.806 --> 30:56.006
¶ Ouch, hey, there, Mr. Fuzzy ¶

30:56.008 --> 30:57.440
¶ well, I guess
that settles that ¶

30:57.442 --> 30:59.341
¶ leave your tour bus
parked out front ¶

30:59.343 --> 31:01.309
¶ and the keys under the mat ¶

31:01.311 --> 31:03.978
¶ whoa, now, hold on
just a minute ¶

31:03.980 --> 31:05.279
¶ hold that jive ¶

31:05.281 --> 31:07.848
¶ 'cause I can feel
this fiddle ¶

31:07.850 --> 31:09.449
¶ 'bout to come alive ¶

31:29.802 --> 31:31.802
Back off, sunshine!

31:37.909 --> 31:39.008
Gettin' better.

31:57.058 --> 31:59.058
Go, zeb!

31:59.060 --> 32:00.325
Yeah, go, zeb!

32:00.327 --> 32:01.492
Whoo-hoo!

32:01.494 --> 32:03.327
All right, zeb.

32:08.466 --> 32:10.065
That's my zeb!

32:10.067 --> 32:11.332
Yeah!

32:29.049 --> 32:31.049
¶ Broken lives ¶

32:31.051 --> 32:32.483
¶ broken strings ¶

32:32.485 --> 32:33.884
¶ broken threads ¶

32:33.886 --> 32:36.453
¶ broken Springs ¶

32:36.455 --> 32:38.254
¶ broken idols ¶

32:38.256 --> 32:39.622
¶ broken heads ¶

32:39.624 --> 32:40.990
¶ people sleeping ¶

32:40.992 --> 32:43.692
¶ in broken beds ¶

32:43.694 --> 32:45.427
¶ ain't no use jivin' ¶

32:45.429 --> 32:47.262
¶ ain't no use jokin' ¶

32:47.264 --> 32:49.163
¶ everything's broken... ¶

32:49.165 --> 32:50.430
oh, no!

32:50.432 --> 32:52.999
Oh, no!

32:54.035 --> 32:55.701
Oh, no!

32:55.703 --> 32:58.637
Country bear hall
has been crushed.

33:10.651 --> 33:12.250
Oh, no!

33:14.354 --> 33:16.287
Unit 2, this is dispatch.

33:16.289 --> 33:19.490
We've got a disturbance up here
at the clubhouse.

33:19.492 --> 33:21.091
We've got Oliver and wendall...

33:21.093 --> 33:22.559
stuck their heads
in the fence again.

33:22.561 --> 33:24.693
Can you get over here
right away, please? Over.

33:28.165 --> 33:30.198
What is that?

33:30.200 --> 33:32.667
That's a sign.

33:34.537 --> 33:35.602
No, not that.

33:35.604 --> 33:36.703
Is that Kentucky fescue?

33:36.705 --> 33:39.605
Oh. Sure is.

33:39.607 --> 33:42.074
Mmm. Beautiful.

33:43.744 --> 33:45.610
Have you seen this boy?

33:45.612 --> 33:47.278
Hmm.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.679
Yup.

33:48.681 --> 33:54.617
Only... in real life,
he's a lot bigger

33:54.619 --> 33:59.220
and not all... tiny and flat
like that.

33:59.222 --> 34:00.387
That's true.

34:00.389 --> 34:01.554
Where is he?

34:01.556 --> 34:03.088
Henry took him.

34:03.090 --> 34:04.255
Henry took him?

34:04.257 --> 34:07.558
In the bus with roadie.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.359
Now, where can we find you?

34:09.360 --> 34:10.426
Right here.

34:10.428 --> 34:16.598
Or maybe over there
in a little while.

34:16.600 --> 34:20.467
Sometimes I'm by that... tree.

34:22.338 --> 34:24.371
Well, thank you very much.

34:24.373 --> 34:25.672
You bet.

34:27.475 --> 34:29.675
So, what do you think,
kidnapping?

34:29.677 --> 34:31.476
Yep. Let's get mobile.

34:31.478 --> 34:33.610
You know, would it kill you
just once

34:33.612 --> 34:35.679
to say "let's get going,
partner"?

34:35.681 --> 34:37.478
Mix it up a little bit?

34:40.350 --> 34:43.150
They like you.

35:07.408 --> 35:11.543
Uh, this is the harp
my daddy gave me.

35:24.156 --> 35:25.421
Uh, uh, hey, zeb, zeb.

35:25.423 --> 35:27.089
I was wondering.

35:27.091 --> 35:29.458
What ever happened to Tennessee?

35:29.460 --> 35:31.293
Saw him a few years ago.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.694
He's still the same heartbroke

35:32.696 --> 35:34.595
mixed-up, psycho,
basket case crybaby.

35:34.597 --> 35:36.430
So, what's he doing?

35:36.432 --> 35:37.597
He's a marriage counselor.

35:37.599 --> 35:38.598
Huh?

35:38.600 --> 35:39.599
I'm tired!

35:39.601 --> 35:41.500
I've been with the baby all day.

35:41.502 --> 35:43.335
Look, I work all day.

35:43.337 --> 35:45.270
I get a lot of stress
from my boss.

35:45.272 --> 35:47.205
I come home,
I just want to relax.

35:47.207 --> 35:48.506
Is that too much to ask?

35:48.508 --> 35:49.874
I mean, what do you think?

35:49.876 --> 35:52.443
What do I think?

35:52.445 --> 35:55.112
I think you two are so dang
lucky to have each other.

35:55.114 --> 35:57.180
Oh, I'm sure you might
fight over the dishes

35:57.182 --> 35:59.165
but at the end of the day...

35:59.166 --> 36:01.149
At least you're going
to be together.

36:01.152 --> 36:02.217
Not like me.

36:02.219 --> 36:03.484
Not like me and trixie!

36:05.488 --> 36:07.421
Oh, I lost her!

36:08.791 --> 36:10.590
Trixie!

36:12.493 --> 36:14.493
Oh, sweetheart!

36:14.495 --> 36:16.361
Oh, baby!

36:17.630 --> 36:18.895
I'm okay.

36:20.231 --> 36:22.631
Oh...

36:31.874 --> 36:32.873
I feel better.

36:32.875 --> 36:34.507
He's good.

36:34.509 --> 36:35.608
Oh, trixie!

36:37.878 --> 36:39.878
Oh, come in.

36:42.616 --> 36:44.315
Huh?!

36:44.317 --> 36:46.483
Don't tell me you're getting
the band back together.

36:46.485 --> 36:48.485
Tennessee...

36:48.487 --> 36:50.620
We're getting the
band back together.

36:51.823 --> 36:53.522
Tennessee: I'm sorry, boys.

36:53.524 --> 36:55.457
I just can't play the thing

36:55.459 --> 36:57.592
not without trixie there. I...

36:57.594 --> 36:58.826
Why'd she break up with you?

36:58.828 --> 37:00.861
Was it that sweater
you're wearing?

37:00.863 --> 37:04.231
Took off with some rich,
millionaire, real estate guy.

37:04.233 --> 37:05.232
A panda!

37:07.051 --> 37:08.867
What's with the pandas?
They get everything.

37:08.870 --> 37:10.669
You're telling me.

37:10.671 --> 37:12.203
You sure it wasn't
that sweater?

37:12.205 --> 37:13.270
Zeb! Huh?

37:13.272 --> 37:14.271
If I knew where she was

37:14.273 --> 37:15.705
I'd be there in a second.

37:15.707 --> 37:18.340
Ah, but even if I could play,
who'd come?

37:18.342 --> 37:20.942
Nobody cares
about the country bears no more.

37:20.944 --> 37:22.810
Nobody even knows who we are.

37:22.812 --> 37:25.212
Hey, how's everybody doing?

37:25.214 --> 37:26.880
Oh, my gosh.

37:26.882 --> 37:27.947
You're the country bears.

37:27.949 --> 37:29.949
Oh... you know who we are?

37:29.951 --> 37:33.385
Sure. You guys inspired me
to go after my dream

37:33.387 --> 37:34.419
to become a famous singer.

37:34.421 --> 37:35.753
Did you make it?

37:35.755 --> 37:37.287
Yeah, Fred, she made it.

37:37.289 --> 37:39.656
She just works here
for the free uniform.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.224
Sorry, no offense.

37:42.226 --> 37:43.225
None taken.

37:43.227 --> 37:44.559
I'm still working on it.

37:44.561 --> 37:47.228
I even do one of your songs,
"kick it into gear."

37:47.230 --> 37:49.196
¶ Kick it into gear ¶

37:49.198 --> 37:51.464
¶ sometimes you just got to... ¶

37:52.467 --> 37:53.466
That old thing?

37:53.468 --> 37:54.900
Blow the dust off that one.

37:54.902 --> 37:57.269
Well, I kind of got
my own arrangement.

37:57.271 --> 38:01.940
¶ Sometimes you just got
to kick it into gear. ¶

38:01.942 --> 38:02.941
Yeah.

38:02.943 --> 38:04.208
Yeah!

38:04.210 --> 38:05.242
Hey, come on. Sing it!

38:05.244 --> 38:06.276
Come on!

38:10.482 --> 38:14.283
¶ When your grip keeps slippin'
and your clutch is gone ¶

38:16.687 --> 38:18.953
¶ And you're tired
of spinning your wheels ¶

38:18.955 --> 38:20.888
¶ on your brain's front lawn ¶

38:20.890 --> 38:24.591
¶ ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ¶

38:24.593 --> 38:27.560
¶ well, keep your asphalt under,
sunny side up ¶

38:27.562 --> 38:30.596
¶ a gas credit card
and a giant coffee cup ¶

38:30.598 --> 38:34.299
¶ the rest of your life
is gonna find you here ¶

38:34.301 --> 38:36.534
¶ get up on the highway
and kick it into gear ¶

38:36.536 --> 38:40.471
¶ kick it into gear,
kick it into gear ¶

38:40.473 --> 38:43.440
¶ that's the only way you're
gonna get on out of here ¶

38:43.442 --> 38:45.442
¶ kick it into gear ¶

38:45.444 --> 38:46.876
¶ Kick it into gear ¶

38:46.878 --> 38:49.511
¶ sometimes you just got
to kick it into gear ¶

38:50.780 --> 38:52.813
Hey, I kind of like this song.

38:52.815 --> 38:53.947
Yeah!

38:53.949 --> 38:55.315
Yeah!

38:55.317 --> 38:59.952
¶ Had some money
for a turbo drive ¶

38:59.954 --> 39:02.354
¶ ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ¶

39:02.356 --> 39:04.689
¶ well, it ain't
the destination ¶

39:04.691 --> 39:07.258
¶ it's the ride, ride, ride ¶

39:07.260 --> 39:09.426
¶ ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ¶

39:09.428 --> 39:12.896
¶ put the heavy to the metal
and grab onto the road ¶

39:12.898 --> 39:15.865
¶ I hear your motor runnin',
it's about to explode ¶ yeah!

39:15.867 --> 39:20.536
¶ Still be waitin'
this time next year ¶

39:20.538 --> 39:22.671
¶ head on down the highway
and kick it into gear ¶

39:22.673 --> 39:25.607
¶ kick it into gear,
kick it into gear ¶

39:25.609 --> 39:28.643
¶ that's the only way you're
gonna get on out of here ¶

39:28.645 --> 39:32.346
¶ kick it into gear,
kick it into gear ¶

39:32.348 --> 39:35.282
¶ sometimes you just got
to kick it into gear ¶

39:39.286 --> 39:40.418
Oh!

39:40.420 --> 39:42.787
Whoo!

39:47.559 --> 39:48.558
¶ Oh, yeah ¶

40:01.404 --> 40:04.304
¶ Kick it into gear,
kick it into gear ¶

40:04.306 --> 40:08.341
¶ that's the only way you're
gonna get on out of here ¶

40:08.343 --> 40:10.643
¶ kick it into gear,
kick it into gear ¶

40:11.679 --> 40:13.612
¶ So if you want to, yeah ¶

40:13.614 --> 40:18.483
¶ kick it into gear,
kick it into gear ¶

40:18.485 --> 40:20.718
¶ that's the only way you're
gonna get on out of here ¶

40:20.720 --> 40:23.087
¶ kick it into gear,
kick it into gear ¶

40:24.824 --> 40:27.391
Whoo-oh!

40:27.393 --> 40:31.428
¶ Sometimes you just got
to kick it into gear. ¶

40:32.497 --> 40:33.729
Order up.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.566
So, how do you boys
like your eggs?

40:39.836 --> 40:41.035
Hot!

40:41.037 --> 40:42.036
Like us.

40:43.039 --> 40:44.171
Yeah. Yeah.

40:44.173 --> 40:45.572
I guess people do remember us.

40:45.574 --> 40:46.973
Yeah.

40:46.975 --> 40:48.541
Yeah. Bears are even on TV.

40:48.543 --> 40:50.109
Anchorman:
Police believe this man...

40:50.111 --> 40:51.176
Hmm? Huh? What?

40:51.178 --> 40:52.911
...Is involved in the abduction

40:52.913 --> 40:54.178
of this ten-year-old boy.

40:54.180 --> 40:55.913
That's you.

40:55.915 --> 40:58.115
Police also believe
his accomplices are

40:58.117 --> 41:00.183
this man, this man,
and this chicken

41:00.185 --> 41:01.918
who are all traveling
in this bus.

41:04.455 --> 41:06.955
We'll keep you updated
on bus watch!

41:06.957 --> 41:09.590
Oh, no!

41:09.592 --> 41:10.757
You guys are kidnappers? Huh?

41:10.759 --> 41:12.225
Of course not, zeb.

41:12.227 --> 41:17.029
Guys...
I think we have a problem.

41:17.031 --> 41:17.896
Hmm? Huh? Hmm?

41:18.832 --> 41:20.097
How many?

41:20.099 --> 41:21.498
Two, please.

41:23.735 --> 41:25.735
Right this way.

41:33.544 --> 41:35.143
Ah! Here you go.

41:38.715 --> 41:41.849
Suspicious activity at 2:00.

41:43.252 --> 41:45.118
How could you possibly
know that?

41:45.120 --> 41:46.486
Look.

41:53.894 --> 41:55.059
Let's give 'em a...

41:55.061 --> 41:56.493
Let's go.

42:11.174 --> 42:14.975
¶ Gone in a breeze ¶

42:14.977 --> 42:16.242
¶ I keep blowing down
the road... ¶

42:16.244 --> 42:17.243
officer: Pull over.

42:17.245 --> 42:18.577
Pull over.

42:18.579 --> 42:20.111
Pull over immediately or...

42:20.113 --> 42:22.113
Uh... or...

42:22.115 --> 42:23.247
Or-or what?

42:23.249 --> 42:24.915
Or we'll make you pull over.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.016
Or we'll make you pull over.

42:26.018 --> 42:28.151
Shake these fellas.

42:28.153 --> 42:29.552
Shake 'em!

42:32.222 --> 42:34.789
¶ Gone in a breeze ¶

42:34.791 --> 42:37.825
¶ I keep blowing
down the road... ¶

42:40.929 --> 42:42.161
Whoa!

42:42.163 --> 42:43.929
¶ Well, now they're gone
in a breeze... ¶

42:43.931 --> 42:44.863
whoa.

42:45.832 --> 42:46.730
Whoa!

42:48.100 --> 42:49.732
I'm scared.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.900
All right, it's time
to lose these guys.

42:51.902 --> 42:53.268
I need honey!

42:53.270 --> 42:54.836
How about a little thing I call

42:54.838 --> 42:56.170
"hiding in the car wash."

42:56.172 --> 42:57.304
Uh, how's that work?

42:57.306 --> 42:58.738
We hide in the car wash.

42:58.740 --> 42:59.739
Oh.

43:16.789 --> 43:19.256
Whoa.

43:19.258 --> 43:20.624
I lost them.

43:20.626 --> 43:22.158
What do you mean,
you lost them?

43:22.160 --> 43:23.559
How do you lose a bus?

43:25.763 --> 43:26.862
Bingo. 9:00.

43:26.864 --> 43:30.165
¶ Ooh, ooh ¶

We're in it.

43:58.121 --> 43:59.253
Where'd they go?

43:59.255 --> 44:00.754
I don't know. I can't see them.

44:00.756 --> 44:02.689
I can't see anything.
Can you see anything?

44:02.691 --> 44:04.090
No, I can't.
Put your window down.

44:04.092 --> 44:05.291
Do you think I should?

44:05.293 --> 44:07.826
Yeah, it's all right.
It's police business.

44:07.828 --> 44:09.277
Right.

Yeah!

46:01.979 --> 46:03.378
Your hair.

46:03.380 --> 46:06.748
Your hair looks ridiculous.

46:08.351 --> 46:09.350
My hair?

46:09.352 --> 46:11.085
Your... mustache.

46:11.087 --> 46:12.219
What about it?

46:12.221 --> 46:14.921
It was a fake?!

46:16.691 --> 46:18.957
You still got it, roadie!

You, too, Mr. Chicken.

Hey, Dex, it's me... beary.

46:46.450 --> 46:50.051
Beary? You are in
so much trouble.

46:50.053 --> 46:51.819
It's kind of cool.

46:51.821 --> 46:54.288
Are mom and dad, uh...

46:54.290 --> 46:57.124
I mean,
Mr. And Mrs. Barrington there?

46:57.126 --> 47:00.427
No! They're out looking
for you, doofus.

47:00.429 --> 47:05.364
Oh, well, tell them I haven't
been kidnapped or anything

47:05.366 --> 47:07.366
and I'm okay.

47:07.368 --> 47:09.901
I figured out my higher purpose.

47:09.903 --> 47:11.502
I'm getting
the country bears back together

47:11.504 --> 47:14.304
for a concert on Saturday
at country bear hall.

47:14.306 --> 47:15.905
No, you're not.

47:15.907 --> 47:17.840
I don't care if you don't
believe me, but it's true.

47:17.842 --> 47:21.310
I just wanted them to know
that I was okay.

47:21.312 --> 47:23.278
Okay, you know, fine.

47:23.280 --> 47:26.247
Just...
When are you coming home?

47:26.249 --> 47:28.315
I'm not.

47:28.317 --> 47:30.050
You're right, Dex.

47:30.052 --> 47:31.985
I got to face facts.

47:31.987 --> 47:33.519
We're different.

47:33.521 --> 47:35.888
I don't belong there.

47:35.890 --> 47:37.289
I never did.

47:37.291 --> 47:40.825
Beary, what are you
talking about?

47:40.827 --> 47:43.193
Dex, you can keep my game boy.

47:45.163 --> 47:46.295
Beary?

47:48.966 --> 47:50.900
Look, you're part of...

47:56.407 --> 47:58.340
So long, country bears!

47:59.476 --> 48:01.142
Whoa! What the...?

48:01.144 --> 48:02.443
Look, he's shooting
a ray gun at us.

48:02.445 --> 48:03.944
Come on. Let's run.

48:06.447 --> 48:08.046
Fred, your harmonica

48:08.048 --> 48:10.281
might disrupt
the aliens' brain waves.

48:10.283 --> 48:11.315
Blow. Blow, Fred, blow!

48:12.384 --> 48:13.983
Ah! That noise!

48:16.053 --> 48:17.919
All: Bear power!

48:22.391 --> 48:24.424
That was bad.

48:32.666 --> 48:36.000
"Appearing tonight:
Trixie St. Claire"?

48:36.002 --> 48:37.134
Oh, man!

48:38.203 --> 48:39.468
Tennessee!

48:39.470 --> 48:42.304
Tennessee, remember
when you said

48:42.306 --> 48:45.140
you'd do anything
to find trixie?

48:45.142 --> 48:46.541
To get her back?

48:46.543 --> 48:48.142
Well, guess what?

48:49.545 --> 48:50.911
Oh...

48:56.618 --> 48:57.950
Thank you...

49:01.388 --> 49:03.521
...for not listening.

49:04.590 --> 49:05.689
Uh, well, I am.

49:07.225 --> 49:08.457
Tennessee!

49:08.459 --> 49:10.592
Uh...

49:10.594 --> 49:13.361
Guys, listen up.

49:13.363 --> 49:15.596
This next song was written

49:15.598 --> 49:17.998
by an old friend of mine.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.634
He wrote it a long time ago
when he was my...

49:23.471 --> 49:27.339
...in a band
called the country bears.

49:27.341 --> 49:28.540
Whoo-hoo!

49:28.542 --> 49:29.707
Bears rock!

49:32.011 --> 49:38.281
¶ Did I lose your love
a long time ago? ¶

49:38.283 --> 49:41.117
¶ did I just wear it out? ¶

49:41.119 --> 49:43.953
¶ baby, I don't know... ¶

49:50.059 --> 49:52.192
Oh, trixie, I'm all

49:52.194 --> 49:55.028
a mess on account
of how much I miss you.

49:55.030 --> 49:56.029
I know...

49:56.031 --> 49:57.597
Tennessee...

They're great.

51:36.248 --> 51:38.214
They were always great.

51:38.216 --> 51:40.649
Better than the eagles.

51:47.257 --> 51:48.522
Yeah?

51:48.524 --> 51:50.090
Henry: Uh, uh, yeah, uh...

Hello?

51:51.259 --> 51:54.226
Ted? Ted, it's, uh, it's Henry.

51:55.295 --> 51:56.327
Henry Taylor?

51:56.329 --> 52:00.064

52:00.066 --> 52:02.299
Yeah, well, uh,

and, uh, I was, uh, well...

52:07.372 --> 52:09.672
Hey, hey, this is exciting!

52:09.674 --> 52:13.142
Uh, we're getting the band back
together for a benefit show.

52:14.545 --> 52:15.810
Great, huh?

52:15.812 --> 52:19.446
What? Get the...
Get the band back together?

52:19.448 --> 52:20.580
Yeah-huh.

52:21.816 --> 52:23.549
I'm going in a tunnel.
I'm losing you.

52:27.087 --> 52:29.520
Okay, Ted, good,
thank you very much.

52:31.624 --> 52:33.090
Well?

52:33.092 --> 52:35.859
Oh, he's in.

¶ ¶

52:51.107 --> 52:54.541
Whoo-eee! Razzle-dazzle!

52:54.543 --> 52:57.410
Looks like old Ted's done
pretty good for hisself.

52:57.412 --> 52:59.112
Fred: Yeah.

52:59.113 --> 53:00.813
Why don't you just borrow
the $20,000 from him, man?

53:00.815 --> 53:02.748
Fred: It don't look
like he'd miss it much.

53:02.750 --> 53:03.749
Henry: Okay, guys

53:03.751 --> 53:05.250
now, one thing at a time, okay?

53:05.252 --> 53:06.517
Just one thing at a time.

53:06.519 --> 53:08.118
Got to do everything here.

53:09.154 --> 53:10.653
All right.

53:10.655 --> 53:13.622
Hello? Hello, we're looking
for a Ted bedderhead.

53:13.624 --> 53:16.791
Uh, two orders of French
fries and a shake.

53:18.394 --> 53:19.526
Fred...

53:19.528 --> 53:21.127
What?

53:21.129 --> 53:22.795
Oh!

53:22.797 --> 53:25.531
Uh, excuse me?

53:25.533 --> 53:27.199
Excuse me?

53:36.642 --> 53:37.874
Can I help you?

53:37.876 --> 53:39.408
Uh, yeah. Uh, Ted bedderhead?

53:39.410 --> 53:41.309
He's, uh, an old friend
of mine, um...

53:42.645 --> 53:43.910
Is he here?

53:43.912 --> 53:45.578
No, he's, uh, not here.

53:45.579 --> 53:47.245
He's probably still at the
country club at the wedding.

53:47.248 --> 53:48.847
Oh, yeah, country club.

53:48.849 --> 53:50.615
Well, thank you.

53:50.617 --> 53:52.850
You're the country bears, right?

53:52.852 --> 53:54.418
Um... yeah. Yeah!

53:54.420 --> 53:55.919
Well, I'm, uh...
Yeah, yeah, I know...

we get it all the time...

53:57.722 --> 53:59.788
and that's real nice, young man,
but, uh, we got to run.

53:59.790 --> 54:00.922
Thank you very much.

54:00.924 --> 54:02.256
Come on, beary.

54:02.258 --> 54:04.258
Come on, beary. Bye.

54:06.795 --> 54:08.594
That guy looks a lot
like Elton John.

54:08.596 --> 54:10.929
Nah, Elton John's taller.

54:15.334 --> 54:17.300
Keep your eyes open
for some clues.

54:17.302 --> 54:18.668
Uh-huh.

54:18.670 --> 54:20.536
Uh, give me a minute, huh?

54:24.741 --> 54:26.273
Yeah.

54:28.176 --> 54:29.841
How's it look?

54:33.580 --> 54:36.547
I'll find a mirror.

54:41.720 --> 54:44.821
Henry: Ted may be a little
surprised to see us

54:44.823 --> 54:47.757
so, uh, let me do the talking,
all right?

54:47.759 --> 54:50.392
Fred: I thought you said
he knew we was coming.

54:50.394 --> 54:52.527
Henry: Well, he does, but...

54:52.529 --> 54:55.830
Let's not embarrass him
in front of his rich friends.

54:55.832 --> 54:57.832
It wasn't me.
It was the chicken.

54:57.834 --> 54:59.333
Henry: Come on, Fred.

54:59.335 --> 55:00.400
Let's find your brother.

55:00.402 --> 55:01.667
Uh... yeah, my brother, um...

55:01.669 --> 55:03.268
Uh-huh.

55:03.270 --> 55:04.669
I'm going to go get
something to eat first.

55:04.671 --> 55:07.338
What? Yeah, eat first.

55:07.340 --> 55:09.973

55:39.902 --> 55:41.935
Like a whale's belly. Yeah.

55:41.937 --> 55:43.069
You, too.

Uh, well...

56:06.589 --> 56:08.522
Wow! Ted bedderhead!

56:10.459 --> 56:11.758
I'm such a big fan.

56:11.760 --> 56:13.025
Oh, I think it's great

56:13.027 --> 56:14.626
you're going to
play in the show

56:14.628 --> 56:15.893
and save country bear hall.

56:15.895 --> 56:17.761
Play in the show?

56:17.763 --> 56:19.362
Henry?!

56:19.364 --> 56:21.063
Henry: No, no, no.

56:21.065 --> 56:24.833
Well, we just thought we'd
drop by and see if we all...

56:24.835 --> 56:26.868
We all?

56:26.870 --> 56:27.902
They're here?

56:27.904 --> 56:29.370

Sorry, ma'am, I... Oh, geez.

56:53.825 --> 56:55.491
Get outta here. Come on.

56:55.493 --> 56:57.759
What, what, what
what makes you think

56:57.761 --> 57:00.495
I'd get back together
with you guys?

57:00.497 --> 57:01.896
Uh...?

57:01.898 --> 57:03.163
Hey, look...

57:03.165 --> 57:05.031
That's where I started out.

57:05.033 --> 57:06.599
I'm not going back.

57:06.601 --> 57:08.934
When I said I was finished,
I meant it.

57:08.936 --> 57:10.402
I'm finished.

57:10.404 --> 57:11.803
But, Mr. Bedderhead

57:11.805 --> 57:12.770
we... Kid...

57:12.772 --> 57:14.471
We need everyone

57:14.473 --> 57:16.606
to make this happen,
and we need you.

57:16.608 --> 57:18.608
Now, listen, kid...

57:18.610 --> 57:20.843
Uh, uh... who is this guy?

57:21.846 --> 57:23.478
All: That's beary.

57:23.480 --> 57:25.012
Uh, no, no, no.

57:25.014 --> 57:27.948
That was a long time ago, kid.

57:27.950 --> 57:29.482
Things change.

57:29.484 --> 57:33.018
Frankly, your little
nostalgic field trip

57:33.020 --> 57:34.786
you know, is kind of pathetic.

57:34.788 --> 57:38.456
Well, maybe it was.

57:38.458 --> 57:40.858
Sorry to have
bothered you, Ted.

57:40.860 --> 57:41.959
People are waiting for me.

57:41.961 --> 57:43.460
You found your way in.

57:43.462 --> 57:45.829
You can find your way out.

57:45.831 --> 57:48.164
Hmm!

57:48.166 --> 57:50.499
That guy's
turned into a real...

57:52.736 --> 57:55.603
I'm going to go get the bus.

57:55.605 --> 57:57.871
My mistake, everyone.

57:57.873 --> 58:00.139
Don't know what I was thinking.

58:00.141 --> 58:03.142
It's not your fault,
Henry. It's mine.

58:03.144 --> 58:04.610
This whole thing was my idea.

58:04.612 --> 58:06.211
No, no, now, it's
nobody's fault.

58:06.213 --> 58:08.613
But it might as well be mine!

58:08.615 --> 58:10.114
Why don't you just...?

58:10.116 --> 58:11.515
Tennessee...

58:11.517 --> 58:15.685
Right. Come on, Fred.

Nope.

You're family.

59:36.017 --> 59:38.117
And you're going.

Officer hamm: When the kidnappers
call to make their demands

59:42.990 --> 59:44.289
we just agree
with whatever they say.

59:44.291 --> 59:46.758
I already told you guys
he hasn't been kidnapped.

59:46.760 --> 59:48.159
He's with the country bears.

59:48.161 --> 59:49.894
Listen to me, son

59:49.896 --> 59:51.896
you can be sure that they're
going to be keeping him

59:51.898 --> 59:53.564
in some creepy underground lair

59:53.566 --> 59:55.566
high up in the building until
they get their ransom, okay?

59:55.568 --> 59:57.034
Would you guys listen to me?

59:57.036 --> 59:58.969
There's not going
to be any ransom.

59:58.971 --> 01:00:00.670
He's with the country bears.

01:00:00.672 --> 01:00:02.605
They're doing a concert
tonight...

01:00:02.607 --> 01:00:03.839
At country bear hall.

01:00:03.841 --> 01:00:06.007
They just said that
to distract you

01:00:06.009 --> 01:00:07.875
sports fan. Besides...

01:00:07.877 --> 01:00:09.943

01:00:14.681 --> 01:00:17.748
Sure. Just... tell me
when they get here.

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:19.116
Good kid.

01:00:19.118 --> 01:00:20.884
He's a keeper. Yeah.

01:00:20.886 --> 01:00:26.222
Ted: All these years, I haven't
been able to face you guys.

01:00:26.224 --> 01:00:28.257
I pretty much lost everything.

01:00:28.259 --> 01:00:31.627
So I been trying
to make a buck.

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:33.695
Singing at weddings
and stuff like that.

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:36.631
Well, at least you're not doing
children's birthday parties.

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:40.167
Well, uh, I am.

01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:41.601
All: Really?

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:45.704
But we saw your house...
Your gardener.

01:00:45.706 --> 01:00:49.207
That's not my gardener.
That's Elton John.

01:00:49.209 --> 01:00:50.208
Told ya.

01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:51.609
I rent a room

01:00:51.611 --> 01:00:52.810
over the garage from him.

01:00:52.812 --> 01:00:55.045
Well, now, brother, that's okay

01:00:55.047 --> 01:00:57.280
'cause we's all together again.

01:00:57.282 --> 01:00:59.148
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:00.782
Just 'cause I'm telling
the truth

01:01:00.784 --> 01:01:01.916
doesn't mean I'm dumb.

01:01:01.918 --> 01:01:02.783
Huh?

01:01:02.785 --> 01:01:04.885
Roadie, stop the bus.

01:01:04.887 --> 01:01:08.054
Ted: Okay, have you rehearsed?

01:01:08.056 --> 01:01:09.622
What songs you gonna to do?

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.123
Who's doing sound?

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:14.793
Tennessee: Well, we ain't exactly
figured all that out yet, Ted.

01:01:14.795 --> 01:01:16.895
Ted: Same old country bears.

01:01:16.897 --> 01:01:19.097
Zeb: Come on, Ted. You
do kind of owe us.

01:01:19.099 --> 01:01:21.332
I mean, you were
the reason we broke up.

01:01:22.702 --> 01:01:25.269
Well! There it is.
Knew that was coming up.

01:01:25.271 --> 01:01:27.738
I'm the reason
we stayed together, zeb.

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.772
Did any of you...

01:01:28.774 --> 01:01:31.741
any of you... ever thank me?

01:01:31.743 --> 01:01:33.876
We all had our jobs to do, Ted.

01:01:33.878 --> 01:01:34.743
Uh-huh.

01:01:34.745 --> 01:01:36.344
Oh, right. Drinkin'...

01:01:37.213 --> 01:01:37.933
Blubberin', and...

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.779
Starin' into space.

01:01:39.781 --> 01:01:40.780
Hey! Huh?

01:01:40.782 --> 01:01:42.148
What we were...

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:43.782
Was years ago.

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:45.617
Blubberin'? Uh, uh...

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:47.752
Well, you were blubberin'.

01:01:47.754 --> 01:01:49.153
Hey? Okay, there.

01:01:50.156 --> 01:01:51.188
Guys! Hey, hey, guys!

01:01:52.624 --> 01:01:53.823
Guys!

01:01:53.825 --> 01:01:56.125
You know, in people magazine,
April 1983

01:01:56.127 --> 01:01:58.994
you all said that
the bears was your family.

01:01:58.996 --> 01:02:00.328
And like a family...

01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:03.331
Kid, that's just a bunch
of meaningless publicity.

01:02:03.333 --> 01:02:05.266
You don't know nothing about

01:02:05.268 --> 01:02:07.201
the real bears, understand?

01:02:07.203 --> 01:02:08.835
Nothin'!

01:02:08.837 --> 01:02:11.304
We are not a family.

01:02:11.306 --> 01:02:14.040
You're right.

01:02:14.042 --> 01:02:17.176
This isn't a family.

01:02:17.178 --> 01:02:20.879
'Cause the people who love you
no matter what?

01:02:20.881 --> 01:02:22.647
That's your family.

01:02:24.117 --> 01:02:26.884
Who told you that, beary?

01:02:26.886 --> 01:02:28.752
My dad.

01:02:34.058 --> 01:02:36.358
My dad.

01:02:42.299 --> 01:02:44.165
Wh... wh... hold on, beary.

01:02:56.312 --> 01:03:00.013
¶ ¶

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:33.007
Mom?

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:35.143
Beary.

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:42.482
Beary!

01:03:42.484 --> 01:03:45.952
Beary, beary, beary! Oh!
There's my good boy!

01:03:45.954 --> 01:03:48.054
Are you all right?
Did they hurt you?

01:03:48.056 --> 01:03:49.221
Did they brainwash you?

01:03:49.223 --> 01:03:51.056
How many fingers
am I holding up?

01:03:51.058 --> 01:03:52.891
I'm fine, mom.

01:03:52.893 --> 01:03:54.125
Oh, honey.

01:03:54.127 --> 01:03:55.126
Norbert! Norbert!

01:03:55.128 --> 01:03:57.828
Yeah, hon, what is it?

01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:59.563
Hi, dad.

01:03:59.565 --> 01:04:02.098
Oh! Beary!

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.400
Oh, beary, beary

01:04:04.402 --> 01:04:06.068
my beary boy! Oh!

01:04:09.139 --> 01:04:10.838
Hey, doofus.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.005
Hey, Dex.

01:04:12.007 --> 01:04:14.239
Look who's home.

01:04:16.509 --> 01:04:17.541
Come here!

01:04:24.515 --> 01:04:26.982
Aw, beary left his stuff.

01:04:26.984 --> 01:04:29.017
Hmm...

01:04:30.186 --> 01:04:33.854
"My hero," by beary barrington,
fourth grade.

01:04:33.856 --> 01:04:36.356
"My hero is really heroes

01:04:36.358 --> 01:04:40.126
"and my heroes
are the country bears.

01:04:41.229 --> 01:04:43.462
"Whenever I'm sad.

01:04:43.464 --> 01:04:45.397
"I play one of their songs

01:04:45.399 --> 01:04:48.299
"and I forget why
I was even sad at all.

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:50.301
"And if you'd met my brother

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.569
you'd know why
I was always sad."

01:04:52.571 --> 01:04:54.237
Hmm.

01:04:54.239 --> 01:04:58.441
"I can't really say zeb
is my hero, or Fred, or Ted

01:04:58.443 --> 01:05:00.009
or even Tennessee."

01:05:00.011 --> 01:05:03.912
"But as the country bears,
what they can do together

01:05:03.914 --> 01:05:06.915
makes them my heroes."

01:05:08.218 --> 01:05:11.385
"I'd like to meet them someday.

01:05:11.387 --> 01:05:13.353
That would be cool."

01:05:14.389 --> 01:05:15.988
It says here

01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:22.594
"a+, but is everything
about the country bears?"

01:05:22.596 --> 01:05:23.962
Hey.

01:05:23.964 --> 01:05:25.496
Beary's a sharp little guy.

01:05:25.498 --> 01:05:26.997
This morning he told me

01:05:26.999 --> 01:05:28.965
something else.

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:31.901
Mr. Chicken... is a girl.

01:05:36.406 --> 01:05:40.374
It's a pretty straightforward
demolition, Mr. Thimple.

01:05:40.376 --> 01:05:41.641
Take about

01:05:41.643 --> 01:05:44.577
a half hour to bulldoze her
to the ground.

01:05:44.579 --> 01:05:47.112
Oh, yes... do that.

01:05:58.656 --> 01:06:00.489
Mom: Dex, honey,
would you get that?

01:06:00.491 --> 01:06:01.990
Okay.

01:06:01.992 --> 01:06:04.125
And tell beary to come
down for some pie.

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.327
Beary! Pie!

01:06:18.239 --> 01:06:20.372
Dex: Uh... beary?

01:06:20.374 --> 01:06:22.507
Hey. That Ted guy is here.

01:06:22.509 --> 01:06:24.976
You want me to kick him out?

01:06:24.978 --> 01:06:27.478
Ted? Ted bedderhead

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.979
is here?

01:06:28.981 --> 01:06:30.313
Yeah.

01:06:37.522 --> 01:06:42.224
You, uh, you left your stuff
on the bus.

01:06:42.226 --> 01:06:43.592
You can keep it.

01:06:43.594 --> 01:06:45.160
I don't want it.

01:06:45.162 --> 01:06:49.997
Um, look, I, uh... mm...

01:06:49.999 --> 01:06:53.133
I hope you know
how lucky you are.

01:06:53.135 --> 01:06:57.737
It only took you three days
to understand something

01:06:57.739 --> 01:07:00.706
that took me ten years
to figure out.

01:07:00.708 --> 01:07:02.340
What's that?

01:07:02.342 --> 01:07:06.210
Mr. Chicken is a girl.

01:07:06.212 --> 01:07:07.978
What?

01:07:09.214 --> 01:07:11.113
I got ya.

01:07:12.249 --> 01:07:17.384
Really, I want to tell you
that I'm sorry.

01:07:17.386 --> 01:07:20.086
I was mad...

01:07:20.088 --> 01:07:23.589
not at you... and I'm sorry.

01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:26.158
And that thing you wrote
in your journal about us

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.659
being great

01:07:27.661 --> 01:07:29.661
when we're together?

01:07:29.663 --> 01:07:30.662
It's true.

01:07:32.399 --> 01:07:34.232
You're going to do the show?

01:07:34.234 --> 01:07:37.200
Nah, we're not doing the show.

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:42.671
Not without you.

01:07:42.673 --> 01:07:45.440
Whoo-hoo!

01:07:45.442 --> 01:07:47.275
Y'all come with me.

01:07:47.277 --> 01:07:50.378
We can all ride together
on the...

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:51.645
Bus? Bus?

01:07:51.647 --> 01:07:53.079
The bus was stolen.

01:07:53.081 --> 01:07:54.713
It was that thimple fella.

01:07:56.516 --> 01:07:58.182
Come on, move along.
Move it. Come on.

01:07:58.184 --> 01:07:59.383
What are you waiting for?

01:07:59.385 --> 01:08:00.717
Thimple, I'm definitely
changing banks.

01:08:00.719 --> 01:08:02.085
Oh, pooh.

01:08:02.087 --> 01:08:04.353
I hate it
when we lose a customer.

01:08:04.355 --> 01:08:05.520
We have to find them.

01:08:05.522 --> 01:08:07.221
They have to do that show.

01:08:07.223 --> 01:08:08.322
Beary, beary.

01:08:08.324 --> 01:08:10.757
Your stuff was on
that bus, right?

01:08:10.759 --> 01:08:11.758
Yeah.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.092
All your stuff?

01:08:20.033 --> 01:08:21.298
We can track them with this.

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:22.432
Yeah.

01:08:22.434 --> 01:08:24.600
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:27.469
All right.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.437
Okay, in you go, big boy.

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:32.305
Hey, hey, hey, no, no.

01:08:32.307 --> 01:08:33.372
Stop!

01:08:33.374 --> 01:08:35.807
I have a better idea.

01:08:43.115 --> 01:08:45.648
Whoa.

01:08:45.649 --> 01:08:47.616
Easy, captain.

01:08:48.585 --> 01:08:51.218
Thimple: Go on. Get in there!

01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.385
Get in there!

01:08:52.386 --> 01:08:54.787
Why are you doing this?

01:08:54.788 --> 01:08:56.788
I can't have that show.

01:08:56.791 --> 01:08:58.657
I can't have you ruin

01:08:58.658 --> 01:09:02.093
what I've been working on
for 30 years.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:03.694
30 years!

01:09:03.696 --> 01:09:04.694
Which way?

01:09:04.697 --> 01:09:07.163
Just, uh... go straight.

01:09:08.267 --> 01:09:09.765
Okay, take a right.

01:09:09.768 --> 01:09:10.633
Take a right here.

01:09:10.635 --> 01:09:12.100
Whoa! Whoa!

01:09:12.103 --> 01:09:13.669
Oh, oh, whoa!

01:09:19.808 --> 01:09:22.707
Whoa, my kidneys.

01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:24.376
Henry: What's the problem, bub?

01:09:24.377 --> 01:09:25.777
You ruined my life.

01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:28.779
Well, it's not our fault
you became a banker.

01:09:28.782 --> 01:09:30.214
Not that.

01:09:30.216 --> 01:09:31.615
What are you talking about?

01:09:31.617 --> 01:09:33.383
This!

01:09:34.786 --> 01:09:36.085
Huh?

01:09:37.087 --> 01:09:38.087
What's he doing?

01:09:38.089 --> 01:09:39.087
Uh-uh.

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:41.090
Zeb: What are you doing?

01:09:41.091 --> 01:09:42.691
Wh-what's he doing?

01:09:44.394 --> 01:09:46.227
Huh?

01:09:47.496 --> 01:09:48.627
This:

01:10:03.443 --> 01:10:05.242
Henry: Oh, my word!

01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:07.110
You're Benny bogswaggle!

01:10:07.112 --> 01:10:09.145
The armpit farter.

01:10:09.147 --> 01:10:11.514
All: Eww...

01:10:11.516 --> 01:10:12.681
That's right.

01:10:12.683 --> 01:10:15.650
A sweet, innocent kid
you jerks beat

01:10:15.652 --> 01:10:17.518
all those years back.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.386
You hit me with a chair.

01:10:19.388 --> 01:10:21.521
And since that day

01:10:21.523 --> 01:10:23.389
I've been plotting my revenge

01:10:23.391 --> 01:10:25.891
waiting for the day
I'd destroy the place

01:10:25.893 --> 01:10:28.526
that brought me misery.

01:10:28.528 --> 01:10:31.729
Well, that day... is tonight!

01:10:33.232 --> 01:10:35.298
No, no, no... No, no...

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:42.236
Left, left.

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:43.705
We're pulling a boat.

01:10:43.707 --> 01:10:44.806
Left, left!

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:48.275
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:10:55.015 --> 01:10:56.814
It's going right.
It's going right.

01:10:56.816 --> 01:10:57.915
Turn right. Turn right.

01:10:59.318 --> 01:11:00.817
Go right. Go right!

01:11:02.587 --> 01:11:04.286
Whoa, oh, oh, oh...!

01:11:04.288 --> 01:11:05.854
Oh, no, no!

01:11:05.856 --> 01:11:06.588
No!

01:11:08.491 --> 01:11:09.557
Aah...!

01:11:13.562 --> 01:11:14.994
We're right on top of it.

01:11:14.996 --> 01:11:15.794
Aah!

01:11:15.796 --> 01:11:17.462
A big turn!

01:11:18.932 --> 01:11:20.264
The bus!

01:11:20.266 --> 01:11:20.998
Whoa!

01:11:49.324 --> 01:11:51.457
That was pretty nifty. Yeah.

01:11:51.459 --> 01:11:53.459
Thanks.

01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:56.595
What do you say we go show
thimple who's boss, huh?

01:11:57.998 --> 01:12:04.001

01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:25.852
¶ we're an American band ¶

01:12:25.854 --> 01:12:27.453
¶ we're coming to your town ¶

¶ we'll help you party it down ¶

01:12:31.725 --> 01:12:34.459
¶ hey! We're an American band. ¶

01:12:37.697 --> 01:12:44.734
¶ I hope the day will be
a lighter highway ¶

01:12:44.736 --> 01:12:50.339
¶ for friends are found
on every road ¶

¶ can you ever think
of any better way ¶

01:12:57.013 --> 01:13:03.951
¶ for the lost and weary
travelers to go? ¶

01:13:03.953 --> 01:13:11.124
¶ making friends
for the world to see ¶

01:13:11.126 --> 01:13:17.062
¶ let the people know
you got what you need ¶

01:13:17.064 --> 01:13:23.968
¶ with a friend at hand,
you will see the light... ¶

01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:25.002
dad: Here we are.

01:13:25.004 --> 01:13:26.069
Beary: Hurry up. Hurry up.

01:13:26.071 --> 01:13:27.570
Open the door. Open the door.

01:13:27.572 --> 01:13:28.771
Watch your step.

01:13:28.773 --> 01:13:29.872
Come on, guys.

01:13:29.874 --> 01:13:31.506
I can't wait to see

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:32.573
the ol' place.

01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:35.108
Hey, where is everybody?

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:36.375
Huh?

01:13:36.377 --> 01:13:38.643
Fred: What going on?

01:13:38.645 --> 01:13:41.846
No cars outside, no lights.

01:13:41.848 --> 01:13:43.113
No... No people.

01:13:43.115 --> 01:13:44.614
Here's the money.

01:13:44.616 --> 01:13:45.781
You give me the five back

01:13:45.783 --> 01:13:47.449
then I give you the ten.
Wait a minute.

01:13:49.019 --> 01:13:50.685
You give me the 20...

01:13:50.687 --> 01:13:51.919
Okay. Hey!

01:13:51.921 --> 01:13:53.086
What's going on here?

01:13:54.055 --> 01:13:55.454
I'm impressed.

01:13:55.456 --> 01:13:57.456
Wow, I'm telling you.

01:13:57.458 --> 01:13:59.391
I am so impressed.

01:13:59.393 --> 01:14:00.959
I cannot tell you

01:14:00.961 --> 01:14:05.563
how impressed I am, but,
boys, it doesn't matter.

01:14:05.565 --> 01:14:07.131
The place is dead.

01:14:07.133 --> 01:14:08.465
Rip... Huh?

01:14:08.467 --> 01:14:09.566
Look at him.

01:14:09.568 --> 01:14:11.935
He never promoted the show.

01:14:11.937 --> 01:14:13.736
Wh...? Rip!

01:14:13.738 --> 01:14:15.471
Oh, Reed... What,
uh, it's not me.

01:14:15.473 --> 01:14:17.005
Rip.

01:14:17.007 --> 01:14:18.773
Uh, hey.

01:14:18.775 --> 01:14:21.075
Wow. Hey, guys, long time.

01:14:21.077 --> 01:14:22.443
Looking good!

01:14:22.445 --> 01:14:24.745
Henry, are you working out?

01:14:24.747 --> 01:14:25.879
Rip!

01:14:25.881 --> 01:14:28.448
It's not personal, Henry.

01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:30.149
It's just business.

01:14:30.151 --> 01:14:33.585
Business? Business
that'll ruin our lives!

01:14:33.587 --> 01:14:34.719
I can't believe...!

01:14:34.721 --> 01:14:36.854
Yeah, maybe, but it-it's him.

01:14:36.856 --> 01:14:38.589
Big Al: Hey, ain't you guys

01:14:38.591 --> 01:14:39.723
doing the show tonight?

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.591
Fred: Uh... Ain't gonna be one

01:14:41.593 --> 01:14:42.625
big Al.

01:14:42.627 --> 01:14:45.127
Nobody showed up.

01:14:45.129 --> 01:14:48.196
What are you talking about,
Fred?

01:14:54.069 --> 01:14:55.068
They's all out

01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:57.003
in the back field.

01:14:57.005 --> 01:14:58.504
They're what?

01:14:58.506 --> 01:15:02.007
Didn't want anyone parkin'
on my grass out front.

01:15:03.610 --> 01:15:05.610
Man: Whoo-hoo!

01:15:09.215 --> 01:15:10.547
No!

01:15:19.723 --> 01:15:20.955
Whoo-hoo! Come on. Come on.

01:15:25.127 --> 01:15:27.994
This is not over, bears!

01:15:30.798 --> 01:15:33.131
I hate you bears. Aah!

01:15:33.133 --> 01:15:34.599
There he is! There he is!

01:15:34.601 --> 01:15:36.233
Ah, look, here's
the money I got.

01:15:36.235 --> 01:15:37.767
Holy moly.

01:15:41.672 --> 01:15:44.906
Henry: Well, folks,
here's the good news.

01:15:44.908 --> 01:15:49.777
The count is in and we saved
country bear hall!

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:55.048
Here we go!

01:15:58.987 --> 01:16:01.988
Bears, bears, bears...!

01:16:05.126 --> 01:16:08.193
Good luck, you guys.

01:16:08.195 --> 01:16:09.160
Hey, where you going?

01:16:09.162 --> 01:16:13.197
To... sit in the audience.

01:16:13.199 --> 01:16:15.866
Well, that's a weird place
for a country bear to sit

01:16:15.868 --> 01:16:17.267
during a country bear concert.

01:16:17.269 --> 01:16:18.868
Yeah, beary.

01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:20.603
You're one of us now.

01:16:21.606 --> 01:16:23.005
Welcome aboard, kid.

01:16:23.007 --> 01:16:25.107
Henry: Ladies and gentlemen

01:16:25.109 --> 01:16:29.010
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you...

01:16:29.012 --> 01:16:31.746
after an absence of many years...

01:16:31.748 --> 01:16:34.882
the one, the only

01:16:34.884 --> 01:16:38.118
the country bears!

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:40.086
Ha, ha! Whoo!

01:17:00.271 --> 01:17:04.873
¶ We take the long way around ¶

01:17:04.875 --> 01:17:10.144
¶ we get lost and we get found ¶

01:17:10.146 --> 01:17:15.748
¶ I wonder why we couldn't go ¶

01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:18.283
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

01:17:20.987 --> 01:17:25.922
¶ Climbing mountains,
crossing streams ¶

01:17:25.924 --> 01:17:30.126
¶ crying tears
and dreaming dreams ¶

01:17:30.128 --> 01:17:35.564
¶ I guess that's the only way
we know ¶

01:17:35.566 --> 01:17:38.333
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

01:17:38.335 --> 01:17:40.268
sing it!

01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:45.272
¶ Straight to the heart
of love should be ¶

01:17:45.274 --> 01:17:50.243
¶ the shortest distance
from lonely ¶

01:17:50.245 --> 01:17:55.580
¶ not always the road
you're thinking of ¶

01:17:55.582 --> 01:17:58.082
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

01:18:00.586 --> 01:18:04.854
¶ So, take a chance,
shine your light ¶

01:18:04.856 --> 01:18:06.021
isn't it wonderful?

01:18:06.023 --> 01:18:10.658
¶ Everything will be all right ¶

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:15.929
¶ you're gonna find a way
to go ¶

01:18:15.931 --> 01:18:18.698
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:21.133
woman: I love you!

01:18:21.135 --> 01:18:25.637
¶ Straight to the heart
of love should be ¶

01:18:25.639 --> 01:18:30.841
¶ the shortest distance

¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

01:18:40.951 --> 01:18:45.787
¶ I've been thinking
about you and me ¶

01:18:45.789 --> 01:18:50.658
¶ and how this love was meant
to be ¶

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:55.829
¶ I'm taking
the next clear shot I see ¶

01:18:55.831 --> 01:19:01.168
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:06.839
¶ I'm taking

01:19:22.254 --> 01:19:27.056
¶ Straight to the heart
of love ¶

01:19:27.058 --> 01:19:29.258
¶ straight ¶

01:19:31.395 --> 01:19:35.363
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

01:19:35.365 --> 01:19:38.031
¶ straight ¶

01:19:40.035 --> 01:19:42.869
¶ straight ¶

01:19:44.105 --> 01:19:45.270
¶ Straight ¶

01:19:47.773 --> 01:19:48.872
Oh, yeah.

01:19:48.874 --> 01:19:50.807
¶ Straight ¶

01:19:50.809 --> 01:19:52.375
go, man, go.

01:19:52.377 --> 01:19:54.143
¶ Straight ¶

01:20:04.253 --> 01:20:05.852
Who's that little bear?

01:20:05.854 --> 01:20:07.486
Oh, that's no little bear.

01:20:07.488 --> 01:20:08.854
That's my brother!

01:20:08.856 --> 01:20:10.088
Yay! Whoo-hoo!

01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:36.212
¶ Straight to the heart
of love ¶

01:20:36.214 --> 01:20:38.080
¶ straight ¶

01:20:40.384 --> 01:20:44.119
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

01:20:44.121 --> 01:20:46.921
¶ straight. ¶

01:21:00.401 --> 01:21:04.102
The country bears!

01:21:05.472 --> 01:21:08.206
How about that, folks?

01:21:11.511 --> 01:21:12.977
Yo, beary!

01:21:12.979 --> 01:21:14.979
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

01:21:14.981 --> 01:21:17.014
You're the bear!
You're the bear!

01:21:17.016 --> 01:21:18.949
Yay!

01:21:18.951 --> 01:21:21.518
Yay!

01:21:28.492 --> 01:21:32.093
¶ There's a town down the road ¶

01:21:32.095 --> 01:21:36.464
¶ where I ain't been before ¶

01:21:36.466 --> 01:21:40.100
¶ nobody knows my name ¶

01:21:40.102 --> 01:21:45.571
¶ or what I'm looking for ¶

01:21:45.573 --> 01:21:49.341
¶ maybe things will be
a little different ¶

01:21:49.343 --> 01:21:53.645
¶ 'cause it can't
stay the same ¶

01:21:53.647 --> 01:21:57.248
¶ I'm gonna ease on
down the road ¶

01:21:57.250 --> 01:22:02.019
¶ where nobody knows my name. ¶

01:22:22.306 --> 01:22:26.241
Don was: <i>14 platinum
records, 26 top ten singles.</i>

01:22:26.243 --> 01:22:29.510
The bears to me really typify
rock and roll.

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:34.013
Their lives embody freedom.

01:22:34.015 --> 01:22:35.447
<i>Nobody tells them what to do.</i>

01:22:39.284 --> 01:22:40.983
Hello.

01:22:40.985 --> 01:22:42.551
Everybody loves the bears.

01:22:42.553 --> 01:22:45.253
The reason I do what I do today
is because of the bears.

01:22:45.255 --> 01:22:47.321
I needed a... you know...

01:22:47.323 --> 01:22:49.556
Somebody that I could relate to,
a certain band

01:22:49.558 --> 01:22:51.958
and the bears... they just did it
for me, you know?

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.226
I admired their, uh, courage.

01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:57.462
And their tenacity.

01:22:58.932 --> 01:23:00.097
And their ability to go out

01:23:00.099 --> 01:23:02.165
and fight
for what they believed in.

01:23:04.369 --> 01:23:06.235
Real legends. It's incredible.

01:23:08.072 --> 01:23:10.472
And I'm glad we didn't get them,
you know, during wintertime.

01:23:13.977 --> 01:23:15.242
Hmm?

01:23:15.244 --> 01:23:17.143
The country was cool and all,
but, you know

01:23:17.145 --> 01:23:19.245
it was becoming the hip-hop
generation, you know.

01:23:19.247 --> 01:23:20.713
People wanted the beat.

01:23:20.714 --> 01:23:22.180
<i>The streets was pop.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

01:23:22.183 --> 01:23:23.615
<i>Let 'em feel</i>
<i>what the country feel like</i>

01:23:23.617 --> 01:23:24.616
<i>when it's bangin'.</i>

01:23:24.618 --> 01:23:25.984
¶ Bow, unh. ¶

01:23:25.986 --> 01:23:27.251
you know what I'm saying?
¶ huh. ¶

01:23:27.253 --> 01:23:29.486
we could do that.

01:23:29.488 --> 01:23:31.187
I found myself going back

01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:32.988
and-and sampling some
of the baselines

01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:35.357
<i>that the bears had</i>
<i>and-and then we used it</i>

01:23:35.359 --> 01:23:37.525
in our first single
and got sued by 'em.

01:23:38.661 --> 01:23:40.227
It was like nothing
I'd ever heard.

01:23:42.631 --> 01:23:44.497
Wow! What is this?

01:23:46.634 --> 01:23:48.634
I have respect for all peoples

01:23:48.636 --> 01:23:49.968
and all bears.

01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:52.370
Bears are human beings,
just like us.

01:23:52.372 --> 01:23:53.504
You understand?

01:23:53.506 --> 01:23:55.038
I'm an alien.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.172
Willie Nelson: <i>Me and zeb</i>

01:23:56.174 --> 01:23:57.306
opened up a can of honey

01:23:57.308 --> 01:23:58.674
on the roof of the white house.

01:23:58.676 --> 01:23:59.675
We had a great time.

01:23:59.677 --> 01:24:01.510
I'm a honey. They dip honey.

01:24:01.512 --> 01:24:02.511
I'm a honey dip.

01:24:02.513 --> 01:24:04.045
You know what I'm saying?

01:24:04.047 --> 01:24:05.379
It's a honey thing, b.

01:24:05.381 --> 01:24:07.114
A certain amount
of honey, they...

01:24:07.116 --> 01:24:08.648
They start to lose focus.

01:24:12.286 --> 01:24:13.652
It was bad.

01:24:13.654 --> 01:24:15.186
Bon appetit.

01:24:16.422 --> 01:24:19.556
They'll eat anything
that isn't locked up.

01:24:19.558 --> 01:24:20.690
Hey, you want a sandwich?

01:24:20.692 --> 01:24:22.692
Uh, no thanks.

01:24:22.694 --> 01:24:24.593
I had trout for breakfast.

01:24:24.595 --> 01:24:27.295
The bears made me feel proud
to be a full-figured woman.

01:24:27.297 --> 01:24:29.397
You want me to eat you,
don't you?

01:24:29.399 --> 01:24:31.232
These guys were fat

01:24:31.234 --> 01:24:33.267
long before it was spelled
with a "ph."

01:24:33.269 --> 01:24:35.535
Come on. In you go.

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:36.669
I always hated bears.

01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:38.070
I knew it.

01:27:48.888 --> 01:27:49.920
cheets: You have one.

01:27:49.922 --> 01:27:51.454
The guys at the
station have one.

01:27:51.456 --> 01:27:52.588
Oh.

01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:54.323
Even Mrs. Davis,
our receptionist, has one.

01:27:54.325 --> 01:27:55.857
You don't have to
wear no fake mustache

01:27:55.859 --> 01:27:57.191
to impress me.

01:27:57.193 --> 01:27:58.325
Thank you.

01:27:58.327 --> 01:27:59.926
You know, I'm kind of glad
this happened.

01:27:59.928 --> 01:28:01.394
Well, good.

01:28:01.396 --> 01:28:03.262
Now, you don't have to
wear no mustache, right?

01:28:03.264 --> 01:28:05.364
No, I'm wearing the mustache.
