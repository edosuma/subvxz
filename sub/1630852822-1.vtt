WEBVTT

02:54.649 --> 02:56.052
Hey!

02:56.085 --> 02:58.120
Hey, man,
it's just me callin' you back.

02:59.722 --> 03:01.523
Hey,
I was just checkin' in,

03:01.556 --> 03:03.592
and seein' how your date
with what's-her-face went?

03:03.625 --> 03:07.163
- Oh, no, that's actually today.
- Oh!

03:07.196 --> 03:09.031
Yeah, all suited up
in a nonchalant way

03:09.065 --> 03:12.034
that signals my complete
and total sexual disinterest.

03:12.068 --> 03:13.970
Are you for real with that?

03:14.003 --> 03:15.805
Of course not.

03:15.838 --> 03:18.708
I actually think I'm on
the verge of a heart attack.

03:18.741 --> 03:21.476
Probably 'cause I haven't
gotten laid in, what, months?

03:21.509 --> 03:22.745
You mean, years?

03:22.778 --> 03:24.579
Shut up!

03:24.613 --> 03:27.850
But I mean, definitely
since my mom got really sick.

03:27.884 --> 03:30.518
Oh, no, no, this is an exciting
time for me, all right?

03:30.552 --> 03:32.755
I get to have some excitement

03:32.788 --> 03:34.957
- in my life.
- YOLO. Man, that's fine to say to me,

03:34.991 --> 03:37.093
but don't let the Boomers hear
you say shit like that, okay?

03:37.126 --> 03:40.897
You know what I mean.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.699
Man, you ever have it happen when
you feel like life is going one way,

03:43.733 --> 03:45.034
and then all of
a sudden, without blinking,

03:45.067 --> 03:48.436
just like everything changes?

03:48.470 --> 03:50.840
To a degree.

03:50.873 --> 03:53.809
I feel like
I'm losing my grip on reality,

03:53.843 --> 03:56.946
and might do
something terrible today.

03:56.979 --> 03:58.214
So that's why
you're packing the Magnums?

03:58.247 --> 04:00.216
Or I mean, the Micros?

04:00.249 --> 04:03.719
Yeah, Magnums for me, and I'll
be mailing you those Micros.

04:03.753 --> 04:08.024
Really, like,
I don't have to restrict myself

04:08.057 --> 04:10.927
to bare emotional
necessities anymore.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.029
Dude,
she needs your help, okay?

04:13.062 --> 04:14.230
You were doin'
what you had to do.

04:14.263 --> 04:15.731
Needed.

04:15.765 --> 04:16.966
Needed.

04:16.999 --> 04:18.466
Eason is watching over her now.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.168
I get it, but it doesn't mean

04:20.202 --> 04:22.470
that you can't still
call her and check in.

04:22.504 --> 04:23.806
Hey, who called who here?

04:24.907 --> 04:25.975
Sorry.

04:27.575 --> 04:29.845
You think this
has been easy for me?

04:29.879 --> 04:33.249
What do you wanna
talk about, Magnums again?

04:33.282 --> 04:35.117
Just a sec, my mother
needs help with the printer.

04:35.151 --> 04:37.153
Okay.

04:50.766 --> 04:52.667
Okay, I'm back.

04:52.702 --> 04:53.769
You still there?

04:55.271 --> 04:56.504
Max?

04:58.540 --> 04:59.909
What age?

04:59.942 --> 05:01.110
What?

05:02.878 --> 05:05.881
What age does life start
staring you in the face?

05:05.915 --> 05:08.184
You know, I'm,
I'm by a river right now,

05:08.217 --> 05:11.187
and there's this
bald eagle landing.

05:11.220 --> 05:12.922
You know, eagles mate for life.

05:12.955 --> 05:15.257
And I thought
you wanted talk about

05:15.291 --> 05:18.227
getting your rocks off,
and blowin' off some steam tonight?

05:18.260 --> 05:20.997
I'm serious, man.

05:21.030 --> 05:23.032
Oh, in their nest,
they also clench their fists,

05:23.065 --> 05:24.934
so they don't hurt their young.

05:24.967 --> 05:26.501
It doesn't always work out.

05:28.771 --> 05:31.606
Anyways, why don't you tell me
about this date, hmm?

05:31.639 --> 05:33.075
No red flags so far?

05:33.109 --> 05:35.845
Red...
No, no red flags.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.781
Actually, she seems amazing,
which is scary.

05:38.814 --> 05:41.717
Eager, which is, you know,
something that I get used to.

05:41.751 --> 05:45.021
Oh, oh, dude,
get this.

05:45.054 --> 05:47.056
Though, it has
not been addressed yet,

05:47.089 --> 05:48.758
- she... No, wait, wait.
- Oh, no!

05:48.791 --> 05:50.960
She is an English
and rhetoric major.

05:50.993 --> 05:52.128
Oh, dear God!

05:52.161 --> 05:53.863
But it's cool, though, dude.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.231
- No, no.
- Don't be academically prejudiced,

05:55.264 --> 05:56.832
- all right?
- Whatever!

05:56.866 --> 05:58.067
- It's your life, okay?
- Okay.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.634
But if you break her heart,

05:59.667 --> 06:01.837
just expect
countless tones, sighs,

06:01.871 --> 06:04.874
social media essays
about how you both shattered

06:04.907 --> 06:07.609
and nurtured
her personal growth.

06:07.642 --> 06:09.644
I am looking to keep
things light, thank you.

06:09.678 --> 06:10.746
Okay

06:10.780 --> 06:12.181
Well, bottom line is,

06:12.214 --> 06:13.883
come out swinging
with your guns loaded.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.851
You have
absolutely nothing to prove,

06:15.885 --> 06:19.121
so don't give some girl control
over your cortisol level.

06:19.155 --> 06:20.823
Jesus!

06:20.856 --> 06:23.259
All right, but
here's a serious question.

06:23.292 --> 06:26.729
What if I actually
start to fall for her?

06:27.830 --> 06:28.931
That's terrifying.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.902
Oh, shit!

06:32.935 --> 06:34.203
She just text me.
She's here.

06:34.236 --> 06:35.938
- What, like right now?
- Uh...

06:35.971 --> 06:37.273
- Yes, right now, actually.
- Okay.

06:37.306 --> 06:39.141
I'll ferry
you over the other side.

06:40.209 --> 06:41.677
Right.

06:41.710 --> 06:42.845
How nervous are you?

06:43.779 --> 06:46.148
Nervous?

06:46.182 --> 06:47.349
On a scale of 1 to 10,

06:47.383 --> 06:48.717
I could use Pep Talk 5.1.

06:50.052 --> 06:51.120
You're really
overthinking this.

06:51.153 --> 06:52.888
I know.
I know I am.

06:52.922 --> 06:54.757
- That's exactly why I need you.
- Fine.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.892
You're a tiger, okay?

06:56.926 --> 06:58.094
You're a lion!

06:58.127 --> 06:59.695
Roar!

06:59.728 --> 07:01.697
- I'm not gonna roar.
- You are Hercules,

07:01.730 --> 07:03.099
and your slashin' Minotaurs,

07:03.132 --> 07:04.700
like they're
dollar store discounts.

07:04.733 --> 07:06.135
Okay?

07:06.168 --> 07:07.736
- Okay.
- You're Hulk Hogan

07:07.770 --> 07:09.839
getting a settlement
for his sex tape.

07:09.872 --> 07:11.707
You got this shit, Max!

07:11.740 --> 07:13.242
Okay, I believe in you.

07:13.275 --> 07:14.677
Now, get out there,

07:14.710 --> 07:16.644
show her the jackpot she scored

07:16.679 --> 07:18.214
when she swiped right!

07:18.247 --> 07:19.949
Thank you.

07:19.982 --> 07:21.649
Tony Robbins doesn't
get me fired up like that.

07:21.684 --> 07:23.285
Who?

07:23.319 --> 07:24.887
Forget it.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.088
You're on your own from here.

07:26.122 --> 07:27.256
Bye.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.663
Hi.

07:35.698 --> 07:36.966
Hi.

07:38.434 --> 07:39.902
How are you?

07:39.935 --> 07:42.371
Well, I'm alive, so.

07:44.206 --> 07:45.741
The same, yep, same.

07:45.774 --> 07:46.809
Excellent.

07:48.477 --> 07:49.712
Like my car?

07:51.847 --> 07:56.852
It's a nice color, yeah.

07:56.886 --> 07:58.420
I'm just kidding.
My brother just dropped me off.

07:58.454 --> 08:01.290
Oh, Jesus.

08:01.323 --> 08:03.425
All right, all right,
this is how we're gonna kick things off?

08:03.459 --> 08:06.795
Had you goin'
for a second, didn't I?

08:06.829 --> 08:09.298
Can you imagine if
that's how I showed up?

08:09.331 --> 08:11.467
- I was gonna say...
- Red flag city.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.102
No, then again,
like I don't even have a car,

08:13.135 --> 08:15.137
so, like, who am I to speak?

08:15.171 --> 08:17.773
Taking care of your mom
the last year, was it?

08:17.806 --> 08:21.844
Yeah. Yeah, it didn't
leave me much time to make money.

08:21.877 --> 08:24.446
Not about to
hold that against you.

08:24.480 --> 08:27.049
Come on! We'll walk over to the theater.
It's not far.

08:27.082 --> 08:28.851
Cool, cool.

08:31.420 --> 08:33.889
Well,
you're not catfishing me,

08:33.923 --> 08:35.890
that's a good start.

08:35.924 --> 08:38.994
Likewise. You, um...

08:40.296 --> 08:42.198
You look amazing.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.265
Thank you.

08:45.768 --> 08:47.970
Whatever happens,
can we both agree that,

08:48.003 --> 08:49.271
as far as
the world is concerned,

08:49.305 --> 08:51.407
we did not meet on a dating app?

08:51.440 --> 08:53.976
Yeah, that's totally fine,

08:54.009 --> 08:57.346
but it's not like we met
on Mormon Mingle or anything.

08:57.379 --> 08:58.981
You're not wrong.

08:59.014 --> 09:00.482
That would, that would
definitely be weird.

09:00.516 --> 09:01.917
I agree.

09:01.951 --> 09:03.052
But, I mean, trust me,

09:03.085 --> 09:04.420
like, I totally get it.

09:04.453 --> 09:06.322
Like, I know
it can be a bit of like

09:06.355 --> 09:10.392
a Petri dish for wounded egos
and male awkwardness.

09:10.426 --> 09:12.428
But honestly,
if it wasn't for the internet,

09:12.461 --> 09:14.797
I don't know how
I'd meet anybody, so.

09:14.830 --> 09:17.032
I was talking to my brother
about that exact thing.

09:17.066 --> 09:18.834
- Oh, yeah?
- He said to me,

09:18.867 --> 09:20.869
"Avery, I don't know
if you're aware of this,

09:20.903 --> 09:23.239
but there are people
in this world, all around us,

09:23.272 --> 09:25.207
who venture to public places,

09:25.241 --> 09:27.142
go to people
they've never met before,

09:27.176 --> 09:29.278
and you become friends
with them right there,

09:29.311 --> 09:30.980
right on the spot."

09:31.013 --> 09:32.815
Well, no, that's like
science fiction to me.

09:32.848 --> 09:34.516
I don't know.

09:34.550 --> 09:36.318
I mean, I know
that's like what a normal,

09:36.352 --> 09:38.954
healthy, average person
is supposed to be doing,

09:38.988 --> 09:41.123
or so the world tells me.

09:41.156 --> 09:43.392
- And yet...
- Here we both are.

09:45.094 --> 09:46.962
Exactly, here we are.

09:48.230 --> 09:50.566
So if you think about it,

09:50.599 --> 09:54.003
I really should blame you
for enabling me.

09:54.036 --> 09:57.172
- Yeah, I was happy you could meet so soon.
- Yeah.

09:57.206 --> 09:59.108
I was lucky to
have the night off.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.977
When I'm looking to have fun,
I'm definitely an enabler,

10:02.011 --> 10:06.081
so look forward to the worst
decisions of your life.

10:06.115 --> 10:09.918
- Oh, okay! All right.
- I mean in a... good,

10:09.952 --> 10:11.587
wholesome,
girlfriend material kinda way.

10:11.620 --> 10:14.156
Who said
I was looking for a girlfriend?

10:14.189 --> 10:17.326
Um...

10:17.359 --> 10:20.029
- You know, I was...
- Oh, no, don't worry.

10:20.062 --> 10:22.164
No, no, no.
I'm sorry to spook you.

10:22.197 --> 10:24.033
- That was not graceful.
- No, no, no, no, are you kidding?

10:24.066 --> 10:25.834
No, I'm actually sorry.

10:25.868 --> 10:27.569
That whole...

10:27.603 --> 10:30.939
The whole foot in mouth thing is
kinda like my bread and butter,

10:30.973 --> 10:33.275
- and thank god you get it.
- Right?

10:33.309 --> 10:35.411
If you ever wanna exchange techniques,
you know, just please let me know.

10:35.444 --> 10:40.115
I kind of have a black belt in
conversational self-sabotage. Yeah.

10:40.149 --> 10:43.018
You're pretty honest.
I do like that.

10:43.052 --> 10:46.422
Not many guys would open a date
with confessions of self-sabotage.

10:48.324 --> 10:51.795
So this is a date then?

10:53.195 --> 10:55.564
I don't know.
Do you want it to be?

10:57.366 --> 11:01.370
I admit,
I'm not picketing the idea.

11:01.403 --> 11:04.139
I'm also cool with this not
labeling anything too quickly.

11:04.173 --> 11:06.475
You know, you can't
trust someone you just met.

11:06.508 --> 11:11.213
Never know who's out there,
or what their motivations are.

11:11.246 --> 11:13.415
I mean, we are going
to a movie tonight, right?

11:13.449 --> 11:15.117
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

11:15.150 --> 11:18.287
And no, like,
BTK Dungeons, no underground,

11:18.320 --> 11:20.589
- and cell?
- Oh, no!

11:20.622 --> 11:23.092
BTK dungeons are after-movie destinations only.

11:23.125 --> 11:25.027
Right! Good.
I just wanted to make sure

11:25.060 --> 11:26.428
we weren't, like,
moving too fast, right?

11:26.462 --> 11:28.397
You know?

11:31.066 --> 11:33.602
But you were saying,

11:33.635 --> 11:36.605
you study, like,
English and rhetoric, right?

11:36.638 --> 11:38.440
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

11:38.474 --> 11:40.342
I'm in the throes of
regretting it, actually,

11:40.376 --> 11:42.211
- My dissertation...
- Really?

11:42.244 --> 11:45.347
...is melting,
like the width of the West.

11:45.381 --> 11:47.449
I found this
Le Guin's story called,

11:47.483 --> 11:48.650
"The Ones Who Walk
Away from Omelas"

11:48.685 --> 11:50.085
Oh, wow!

11:50.119 --> 11:51.653
You gotta meet my buddy, Dave.

11:51.688 --> 11:53.489
You two would get along
like fireworks.

11:56.024 --> 11:58.093
- I just...
- I didn't mean it.

11:58.127 --> 11:59.962
That's... Sorry.

11:59.995 --> 12:00.996
- Yes.
- Oh.

12:01.029 --> 12:02.064
- Yes.
- Okay.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.265
So...

12:03.298 --> 12:04.566
Um...

12:04.600 --> 12:06.402
- In Omelas...
- Mm-hmm.

12:06.435 --> 12:09.037
...every possible thing
that could ever make you happy

12:09.071 --> 12:12.174
is available on tap
every second of every day.

12:12.207 --> 12:15.644
No war, no crime, no poverty.

12:15.678 --> 12:18.715
- Well mandatory puppies, of course.
- Exactly.

12:18.748 --> 12:19.716
- Right.
- Paradise.

12:19.749 --> 12:21.417
Yeah.

12:21.450 --> 12:25.154
Except there's
this kid locked in a cage

12:25.187 --> 12:27.556
deep in a dungeon, tortured.

12:27.589 --> 12:29.191
Nobody talks about it.

12:29.224 --> 12:31.293
Everybody just accepts that

12:31.326 --> 12:33.395
the boy needs to
be tortured endlessly

12:33.429 --> 12:39.034
in order to maintain
the divinity of their paradise.

12:39.067 --> 12:43.405
Wow! A very positive
life-affirming story you got there.

12:43.439 --> 12:46.341
You could say that,
but you can't say that's more messed up

12:46.375 --> 12:47.710
than the world we live in now.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.246
I guess.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.349
So anyway, there are people
who refuse to take part

12:54.383 --> 12:55.584
in that whole system of living.

12:55.617 --> 12:57.186
- Right.
- And?

12:59.354 --> 13:03.659
Uh, they walk away
from the Omelas.

13:03.693 --> 13:06.028
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

13:06.061 --> 13:07.996
So...

13:08.030 --> 13:10.265
You know, it's easy to side
with the people who walk away,

13:10.299 --> 13:14.269
but the two groups are
really doing the same thing.

13:14.303 --> 13:17.072
I mean, at the end, the kid is
still there being tortured, right?

13:19.541 --> 13:22.478
Okay, a totally
nonjudgmental question.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.079
Shoot.

13:24.112 --> 13:25.080
What would you do?

13:25.113 --> 13:26.448
What would I do?

13:26.482 --> 13:28.283
Yeah, if you had
that choice to make,

13:28.317 --> 13:31.119
what would, uh,
what would you choose?

13:31.153 --> 13:33.355
I think if I didn't
grapple with the answer,

13:33.388 --> 13:36.291
I wouldn't like
the story so much.

13:36.325 --> 13:38.695
Why? What about you?
What would you do?

13:44.233 --> 13:47.069
Well, I, I guess I just did it.

13:47.102 --> 13:48.570
What do you mean?

13:51.206 --> 13:53.475
Walked away.

13:53.509 --> 13:57.714
I mean, I just left
my mom on her death bed,

13:57.747 --> 14:01.116
'cause it got to be
too much for me.

14:01.149 --> 14:03.285
I read up on
Huntington's disease

14:03.318 --> 14:06.421
when you told me about it.
That's no easy thing.

14:08.090 --> 14:09.324
Yeah, I mean, it was...

14:11.326 --> 14:13.595
There were just
like only so many days

14:13.629 --> 14:16.365
I could watch her get sick.

14:16.398 --> 14:19.601
You know, it's like all
her memories together, fading,

14:19.635 --> 14:23.305
despite her still
being alive in front of me.

14:23.338 --> 14:25.340
I mean, like,
I was her lifeline.

14:25.374 --> 14:27.677
She honestly really
was like my best friend.

14:29.712 --> 14:32.381
I just got to like
a certain point where I just,

14:32.414 --> 14:36.285
I guess I just felt
like I gave, gave, and gave,

14:36.318 --> 14:38.855
until, like,
I felt as sick as she was.

14:38.888 --> 14:42.057
It's kinda like it was trading
in all her good memories for...

14:43.392 --> 14:44.560
something terrible.

14:48.163 --> 14:49.699
I mean, I still
don't know why, like,

14:49.732 --> 14:51.300
I chose to be her lifeline,

14:51.333 --> 14:55.304
or, like, why I chose to leave.

14:55.337 --> 14:58.340
Maybe there's just something
I haven't forgiven her for?

14:58.373 --> 15:00.309
I'm sorry.

15:00.342 --> 15:02.311
- I'm sorry, that was...
- That's okay.

15:02.344 --> 15:04.246
Yeah, I don't write, so.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.214
What would
your thesis say about that?

15:10.619 --> 15:14.489
Is it just me, or does this look
really uninviting all of a sudden?

15:14.523 --> 15:16.658
Yeah.
What is going on?

15:16.693 --> 15:18.160
I mean, I know
you kind of do have

15:18.193 --> 15:19.696
the school
shooter vibe going on.

15:19.729 --> 15:21.430
Maybe they heard
you were coming, and thought,

15:21.463 --> 15:23.465
- hey, you know, just in case.
- Oh, that's funny,

15:23.498 --> 15:26.168
- now that I know about the whole self-sabotage?
- Oh.

15:26.201 --> 15:28.637
I'm actually the manager here.

15:28.670 --> 15:30.272
Oh.

15:30.305 --> 15:31.808
- Nice.
- In fact,

15:31.841 --> 15:33.609
if you ever want free
tickets, I'm you're gal.

15:33.642 --> 15:34.811
Oh, no, that's too much.

15:34.844 --> 15:36.713
It's no trouble.

15:36.746 --> 15:39.716
God, it's like being on
a date with a Hollywood agent.

15:39.749 --> 15:41.483
Well, I don't know about that.

15:41.516 --> 15:43.185
I've got the white tickets,
not the green ones.

15:43.218 --> 15:44.754
Well, not yet.

15:44.787 --> 15:46.588
That's the spirit.

15:46.622 --> 15:48.590
Come on!

15:48.624 --> 15:50.793
Oh, be careful.

15:54.262 --> 15:55.765
Hey, you can't go any further!

15:55.798 --> 15:58.701
- Oh, I work here. What happened?
- Avery!

15:58.735 --> 16:01.303
Hey! What the hell?
What's going on in there?

16:01.336 --> 16:02.604
I was just
talking to Lucy about it.

16:02.638 --> 16:04.406
The phone rings, she picks up,

16:04.439 --> 16:06.208
there's a guy
on the phone saying,

16:06.241 --> 16:07.777
"There's a bomb under
the seat in Theater Three".

16:07.810 --> 16:09.411
We had to cancel
the whole "Evil Dead" screening.

16:09.444 --> 16:11.413
No postponement,
it's just not happening.

16:11.446 --> 16:12.949
That's crazy!
That's what we were gonna go see!

16:12.982 --> 16:14.650
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I was in the lobby

16:14.684 --> 16:15.818
when they cleared us out.
Look at my hands.

16:15.852 --> 16:17.452
I'm shaking!

16:17.486 --> 16:18.855
Oh, Jake, this is Max.

16:18.888 --> 16:21.256
All right then, salutations.

16:21.289 --> 16:22.759
Nice to meet you too.

16:22.792 --> 16:24.226
How do you two

16:24.259 --> 16:25.627
know each other?

16:25.661 --> 16:27.964
He's, uh...

16:27.997 --> 16:30.632
- Oh, I see!
- What?

16:30.666 --> 16:32.534
What?

16:32.567 --> 16:34.771
Still haven't given up
on the whole manager routine?

16:34.804 --> 16:36.304
You're talking too much.

16:36.338 --> 16:37.539
It's not like
I don't already know

16:37.572 --> 16:39.374
that this shit is a Tinder date.

16:39.408 --> 16:40.810
We didn't meet on Tinder.

16:40.843 --> 16:43.278
Listen, your name's Max, right?

16:43.311 --> 16:45.480
As far as I'm concerned.

16:45.514 --> 16:46.816
You seem nice.

16:46.849 --> 16:49.451
You're really cute,
not gonna lie.

16:49.484 --> 16:51.353
I've had a couple.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.789
The pre-game's starting
to hit like a drunken stepdad.

16:52.822 --> 16:55.590
And I have to tell you,
this girl here,

16:55.624 --> 17:00.262
smart, funny, humble, sweet.

17:00.295 --> 17:02.732
- Do not buy it for a second.
- Jake?

17:02.765 --> 17:05.267
Does this same routine
step for step, note for note,

17:05.300 --> 17:06.667
that she tried on the last guy,

17:06.703 --> 17:08.470
and the guy before that,

17:08.502 --> 17:09.739
- and the guy before that.
- Jake!

17:09.771 --> 17:11.440
She picks him up in the car,

17:11.473 --> 17:12.942
swings by the movie theater.

17:12.974 --> 17:14.342
Oh, what do you know?

17:14.376 --> 17:15.811
I can get you in for free!

17:15.845 --> 17:17.546
Turns up the volume
on the sad girl shit,

17:17.579 --> 17:19.647
like it fools anybody.

17:19.682 --> 17:21.516
This girl dips her pen like she's
William fucking Shakespeare.

17:21.550 --> 17:22.952
What the hell, dude?

17:22.984 --> 17:25.287
- Oh, my god!
- Max, he's plastered.

17:25.319 --> 17:28.522
- Don't listen to him.
- I'm not plastered. I'm just being real.

17:28.557 --> 17:30.425
No, I need you to be gone.
That's what you need to be right now.

17:30.459 --> 17:32.394
No, look.

17:32.427 --> 17:33.428
- I love you.
- Jake?

17:33.462 --> 17:35.597
Okay, I love you.

17:35.630 --> 17:37.399
This girl, man.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.567
Max, I'm sorry.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.802
I'm full of shit.

17:39.836 --> 17:41.704
This girl will take you places.

17:41.738 --> 17:44.774
I've never seen someone so
committed to those she loves.

17:44.807 --> 17:46.042
A true family gal.

17:46.075 --> 17:47.576
Yeah, okay.

17:47.609 --> 17:48.945
I love you.
I love you too, Jake.

17:48.978 --> 17:50.680
Just, um,
get the hell away from me.

17:52.014 --> 17:53.683
We're gonna go
have fun somewhere else,

17:53.716 --> 17:55.985
and you're gonna go
puke in the bushes, okay?

17:56.018 --> 17:57.452
That sounds awesome.

17:57.486 --> 17:58.855
- I won't let you down.
- Okay.

17:58.888 --> 18:00.355
Wish me luck.

18:00.388 --> 18:01.656
Bye, Max.

18:01.691 --> 18:03.258
Bye, Jake.

18:10.933 --> 18:13.301
Wow!

18:13.335 --> 18:14.436
Sure was somethin'.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.671
That was so embarrassing.

18:18.473 --> 18:22.879
Yeah, so...
how's it being the manager?

18:24.346 --> 18:25.380
I'm sorry.

18:26.983 --> 18:28.751
Yeah. Why...

18:28.785 --> 18:30.686
Why would you lie about that?

18:31.788 --> 18:34.322
Can I just be honest?

18:34.356 --> 18:37.425
Yeah, I mean, you could've
been honest earlier too.

18:37.459 --> 18:41.831
So, we're on Humber, we match,

18:41.864 --> 18:43.933
and I was...

18:43.966 --> 18:46.434
I just felt
a strong connection to you.

18:46.468 --> 18:48.070
Your past,
what you've been through,

18:48.104 --> 18:50.940
it's not that different
from what I've been through,

18:50.973 --> 18:55.443
- or I'm going through.
- Okay.

18:55.477 --> 18:57.379
So I didn't think
you'd wanna meet me

18:57.412 --> 18:59.648
if I told you I was some girl
employed at a movie theater.

19:01.483 --> 19:05.922
So, what, you thought
manager of a movie theater

19:05.955 --> 19:08.390
is a huge step up?

19:08.423 --> 19:09.926
Point taken.

19:11.761 --> 19:13.729
So here we are.

19:13.763 --> 19:16.132
Yeah, I'm sorry.

19:16.165 --> 19:18.633
No, it's totally okay.

19:18.667 --> 19:21.103
All right? I mean, I guess
it just looks like this

19:21.137 --> 19:24.841
self-sabotage thing
is a two-way street.

19:24.874 --> 19:26.374
And, you know, by the way,

19:26.408 --> 19:28.376
there's, like,
nothing uncool about

19:28.410 --> 19:29.879
working in a movie theater.

19:29.912 --> 19:32.581
Ginsburg, Friday,
movie theater rat at night,

19:32.614 --> 19:34.382
that is totally cool.

19:34.416 --> 19:36.451
I feel a little
boneheaded right now.

19:40.522 --> 19:43.358
I guess you'll just
have to make it up to me.

19:44.559 --> 19:45.627
True.

19:45.660 --> 19:47.495
Drinks on me.

19:47.529 --> 19:48.898
You said, "You were looking
to have a wild night out."

19:48.931 --> 19:51.499
I'll get us a bottle of Inferno.

19:51.533 --> 19:54.436
Inferno? I have never
had that.

19:54.469 --> 19:56.105
You've never had it?

19:56.138 --> 19:58.406
No, nope.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.776
Okay, well, it's a bit
of a college bro drink,

20:00.810 --> 20:02.078
- to be honest...
- Okay, okay.

20:02.111 --> 20:04.046
...but it is
always an experience.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.513
Gets the night moving.

20:05.547 --> 20:06.849
It's good.

20:06.883 --> 20:09.517
Is it like actually good?

20:09.551 --> 20:11.053
Like I'll enjoy
drinking it good,

20:11.087 --> 20:14.190
or is it burning
my stomach lining good?

20:14.223 --> 20:16.491
The best of both worlds, really.

20:18.027 --> 20:19.494
All right.

20:19.527 --> 20:21.063
All right,
you had me at Inferno.

20:21.097 --> 20:22.098
Great!

20:22.131 --> 20:23.766
Let's find a bar.

20:23.799 --> 20:24.800
Right now?

20:24.834 --> 20:26.601
Yeah, why not?

20:26.635 --> 20:28.637
"Evil Dead" screening is dead,

20:28.670 --> 20:31.539
- and the evening is young.
- Yes.

20:33.508 --> 20:35.410
Okay.

20:41.984 --> 20:45.788
Interesting order
we've got going on here.

20:45.821 --> 20:47.723
What?

20:47.757 --> 20:50.860
It's just usually handholding
is a bit later in the game.

20:50.893 --> 20:53.662
Oh, I'm sorry,
I got a little excited.

20:55.164 --> 20:58.067
Usually after
someone says that, they let go.

20:58.100 --> 21:00.602
True! My bad.

21:00.635 --> 21:02.537
I just...

21:02.570 --> 21:07.143
I mean, usually handholding
is preceded by kissing, yeah?

21:07.176 --> 21:10.578
Very persuasive.

21:21.791 --> 21:23.125
Now who's moving too quickly?

21:23.159 --> 21:24.894
Come on!

21:26.829 --> 21:29.098
Uh, just wait here, okay?

21:29.131 --> 21:31.167
- What?
- It'll just be a moment.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.103
- Who's that?
- I will be right back.

21:34.136 --> 21:35.771
Okay.

22:16.879 --> 22:19.547
- Hey! You all right?
- Uh...

22:19.581 --> 22:21.117
- Yeah, I'm sure, yeah.
- You're bleeding.

22:21.150 --> 22:22.118
I'm what?

22:22.151 --> 22:24.086
Yeah, um...

22:24.120 --> 22:25.254
Here.

22:25.287 --> 22:26.588
Oh!

22:26.621 --> 22:27.622
- No, no, no!
- I got it.

22:27.655 --> 22:28.623
It's okay, I got it.

22:28.656 --> 22:29.759
I'm sorry.

22:29.792 --> 22:32.194
- It's...
- No, it's okay.

22:32.228 --> 22:34.864
- Who was that in there?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

22:34.897 --> 22:35.998
Really.

22:36.032 --> 22:37.333
Come on.

22:37.366 --> 22:39.702
Let's get a drink.

22:39.735 --> 22:41.003
Hey
what can I get for you?

22:41.037 --> 22:42.238
Two shots of Inferno.

22:42.271 --> 22:43.671
Shots.

23:22.745 --> 23:23.946
Here we go.

23:23.979 --> 23:25.748
Oh.

23:25.781 --> 23:28.217
Oh, it looks
like a caramel apple.

23:28.250 --> 23:31.921
There's already
been way too much anticipation.

23:31.954 --> 23:34.356
I take it back.
You're gonna hate it.

23:34.390 --> 23:37.059
Cheers.

23:38.727 --> 23:40.096
Yes!

23:40.129 --> 23:42.298
Okay, you are right.
I actually hate it.

23:42.331 --> 23:43.933
- I'm done.
- Have some more!

23:43.966 --> 23:45.768
Don't you wanna
lose your inhibitions?

23:51.907 --> 23:53.175
Feel okay?

23:53.209 --> 23:54.310
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

24:39.989 --> 24:41.690
You want some more?

24:43.025 --> 24:44.059
Yeah.

24:47.296 --> 24:51.167
It's kinda loud,
and do you wanna take this outside?

24:51.200 --> 24:52.701
Okay.

24:56.939 --> 24:58.407
Uh, we'll do the bottle.

25:03.946 --> 25:05.481
It'll be $35.

25:05.514 --> 25:07.149
Thank you.

25:17.426 --> 25:18.694
Thank you.

25:22.064 --> 25:23.866
Ready?

25:23.899 --> 25:25.234
Yeah.

25:32.074 --> 25:34.276
Let's find
somewhere to go drink this.

25:38.447 --> 25:42.751
Actually,
I think I've had enough.

25:42.785 --> 25:44.153
Is something wrong?

25:46.956 --> 25:49.124
Okay, yeah, it's just...

25:50.359 --> 25:52.027
before I came out here,

25:52.061 --> 25:55.531
I made this list of,
like, resolutions.

25:55.564 --> 25:59.535
One of them was just to
be more direct with people.

25:59.568 --> 26:00.803
Okay.

26:03.239 --> 26:04.506
Do you have a boyfriend?

26:06.375 --> 26:08.510
It's just when you paid,

26:08.544 --> 26:10.479
you opened your wallet,
there was a picture of that same goth guy

26:10.512 --> 26:12.314
you ran off to go flirt with
a few seconds okay,

26:12.348 --> 26:15.784
- and I just wanted to...
- Okay, I see.

26:15.818 --> 26:17.152
Yeah, who is he?

26:17.186 --> 26:18.487
Oh, he's handsome, right?

26:21.190 --> 26:22.925
What?

26:22.958 --> 26:24.560
Should I just call it a night?

26:24.593 --> 26:28.797
What? You don't think
that we look good together?

26:28.831 --> 26:30.299
Okay, what the hell
kind of question is that?

26:30.332 --> 26:32.568
- Stop, stop!
- What?

26:32.601 --> 26:37.840
Do you notice any...
similarities?

26:43.245 --> 26:46.048
Oh! Shit.

26:47.449 --> 26:49.218
Yeah, uh, he's my brother.

26:49.251 --> 26:50.853
Oh, God!

26:52.921 --> 26:53.956
No, no, no!

26:53.989 --> 26:55.491
Okay.

26:55.524 --> 26:57.459
I am so sorry!

26:57.493 --> 26:59.928
I, I truly hate that guy.

26:59.962 --> 27:02.131
I do not wanna be that guy.

27:02.164 --> 27:04.466
- I hate when guys are like--I mean,
if you wanna just call a night,

27:04.500 --> 27:06.368
- then that's what we'll do?
- No, no, no, no, no!

27:06.402 --> 27:08.404
- No, I am...
- No free movie ticket,

27:08.437 --> 27:10.105
and she has a brother,

27:10.139 --> 27:12.074
so you might as well
cut your losses, right?

27:12.107 --> 27:13.876
It's just funny.

27:13.909 --> 27:16.245
I mean, yes,
I jump to conclusions,

27:16.278 --> 27:19.214
but who keeps a picture of
their brother in their wallet?

27:20.549 --> 27:24.153
Family is
really important to me.

27:24.186 --> 27:27.122
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for my brother.

27:27.156 --> 27:28.390
Unexpectedly wholesome.

27:29.958 --> 27:31.093
Well, anyway...

27:34.196 --> 27:36.131
I feel stupid.

27:36.165 --> 27:37.232
Oh, my gosh.

27:37.266 --> 27:38.334
What?

27:38.367 --> 27:40.035
It is...

27:40.069 --> 27:43.339
Every time
is like the first time.

27:43.372 --> 27:46.075
Okay, well,
I got the car off my brother.

27:46.108 --> 27:47.643
Oh.

27:47.676 --> 27:50.212
And I think that we need
a little change of pace.

27:50.245 --> 27:51.480
Okay.

28:00.489 --> 28:02.491
What do you have in mind?

28:02.524 --> 28:04.293
Do you believe in ghosts?

28:05.594 --> 28:09.264
- Oh, ghosts, no.
- Oh, okay.

28:09.298 --> 28:13.235
So I assume haunted houses
are no different?

28:13.268 --> 28:15.471
That's right,
but I don't wanna go around

28:15.504 --> 28:18.340
kicking the hornet's
nest either.

28:18.374 --> 28:21.343
What if I told you, I know of a
haunted house not too far from here?

28:21.377 --> 28:22.878
Would you wanna check it out?

28:24.079 --> 28:25.314
Right now?

28:25.347 --> 28:27.416
Why not?

28:30.652 --> 28:32.488
I don't know.

28:32.521 --> 28:34.423
- You know, it's...
- All right, think of it this way.

28:34.456 --> 28:37.092
- Okay.
- Why settle for a horror movie

28:37.126 --> 28:39.228
when we can go
and see the real thing?

28:47.436 --> 28:49.638
So...

28:49.671 --> 28:51.039
Is that a yes?

28:54.376 --> 28:56.211
I don't know. Um...

28:58.213 --> 28:59.515
What if...

28:59.548 --> 29:01.183
I mean, there
could be squatters.

29:01.216 --> 29:02.618
Don't you like surprises?

29:02.651 --> 29:04.420
Yeah, I do,

29:04.453 --> 29:08.023
and I am looking to
have a wild night tonight,

29:08.056 --> 29:13.595
just... you know,
as long as it's calculated.

29:13.629 --> 29:15.030
I see.

29:15.063 --> 29:17.032
Glove box.

29:17.065 --> 29:18.100
What?

29:18.133 --> 29:19.401
Glove box, open it.

29:22.438 --> 29:23.639
- Okay.
- Open it!

29:23.672 --> 29:26.141
Okay, okay!

29:31.146 --> 29:32.247
This is yours?

29:32.281 --> 29:33.315
Pick it up.

29:33.348 --> 29:34.450
Careful, it's loaded.

29:44.026 --> 29:45.627
Why do you have this?

29:45.661 --> 29:47.362
Protection from ghosts.

29:48.698 --> 29:49.998
Point it at me.

29:51.066 --> 29:52.534
What?

29:52.568 --> 29:55.137
Hold it with both hands
and point it at me.

29:55.170 --> 29:58.140
You... Avery, I'm sorry,
that's really weird to ask someone.

29:58.173 --> 30:00.242
I wanna prove
something to you.

30:06.048 --> 30:07.449
Okay.

30:11.086 --> 30:12.421
Now, cock it.

30:12.454 --> 30:14.122
Avery?

30:14.156 --> 30:16.258
Pull the hammer back
until you hear it click.

30:16.291 --> 30:18.627
Okay, I'm not so sure
Inferno was the best idea.

30:21.396 --> 30:24.734
Come on!

30:40.215 --> 30:42.417
Okay, loaded,
but nothing in the chamber.

30:44.186 --> 30:45.320
Do you trust me again?

30:47.155 --> 30:49.491
My God!

30:49.525 --> 30:51.193
Come on, cock it!

30:57.199 --> 31:00.669
Okay.

31:06.843 --> 31:09.144
Nothin' to worry about.

31:09.177 --> 31:10.813
I know you'd
never shoot me, right?

31:12.414 --> 31:14.717
Of course,
I would not shoot you.

31:14.751 --> 31:16.786
You see?

31:16.819 --> 31:19.187
Calculated, but safe.

31:20.690 --> 31:24.861
I guess.

31:24.894 --> 31:30.666
Okay, but really, like why...

31:30.700 --> 31:32.501
Why do you have this?

31:32.534 --> 31:34.704
Protection?

31:34.737 --> 31:36.605
You know what I mean.

31:36.638 --> 31:40.777
Well,
I once walked away too,

31:40.810 --> 31:45.113
or rather, as you put it, ran.

31:45.147 --> 31:46.348
Both me and my brother.

31:46.381 --> 31:48.283
That's why we're so close.

31:48.317 --> 31:50.586
I guess I have it to feel safe.

31:52.454 --> 31:53.690
I see.

31:55.557 --> 31:57.860
Wanna play the question game?

31:57.894 --> 32:00.128
The question game?

32:00.162 --> 32:02.631
Uh...

32:02.664 --> 32:04.867
I would say,
it is a bit childish,

32:04.901 --> 32:07.669
but considering
we are already on the way

32:07.704 --> 32:09.739
to a haunted house, yes!

32:09.772 --> 32:11.139
Okay.

32:11.173 --> 32:12.140
You can go first.

32:12.174 --> 32:13.141
Oh, no, you.

32:13.175 --> 32:14.209
I insist.

32:15.243 --> 32:17.546
Alright, um...

32:17.579 --> 32:19.414
How many girls
have you slept with?

32:21.183 --> 32:23.485
Oh, all right,
starting there, are we?

32:23.518 --> 32:25.153
Okay.

32:29.859 --> 32:33.730
Okay, I know the general
rule is you divide by two

32:33.763 --> 32:36.298
and say that answer.

32:36.331 --> 32:39.334
But for me, it's probably
better if I multiply.

32:39.368 --> 32:40.569
Is that right?

32:41.938 --> 32:45.742
So... four.

32:45.775 --> 32:47.175
Seriously?

32:47.209 --> 32:48.276
Swear to God.

32:49.812 --> 32:52.314
Were you hoping
make that five tonight,

32:52.347 --> 32:53.783
or should I slow down?

32:55.818 --> 32:58.587
You don't have to slow down.

32:58.620 --> 32:59.655
Noted.

33:01.991 --> 33:05.895
All right, it is my...
my turn to ask.

33:05.928 --> 33:07.195
Shoot.

33:09.832 --> 33:11.934
What's the scariest thing
that's ever happened to you?

33:12.902 --> 33:14.436
Oh, interesting.

33:16.638 --> 33:20.308
Well, it has to be when my
brother and I tried to not run,

33:20.342 --> 33:21.510
but to fight back.

33:22.745 --> 33:24.981
Can I ask from what?

33:25.014 --> 33:29.952
See, my brother has,
um, a stalker.

33:29.986 --> 33:32.521
- Oh!
- Well, the stalker's not alive anymore.

33:32.554 --> 33:34.289
Oh, had a stalker?

33:34.322 --> 33:35.925
When he was alive, though,

33:35.958 --> 33:38.995
we had a lot of problems
of getting anyone to listen

33:39.028 --> 33:42.699
or believe us
about what was going on.

33:42.732 --> 33:44.734
When it involves believing a
boy, they say, "Be a man",

33:44.767 --> 33:48.236
so we just gave up

33:48.270 --> 33:49.906
and resorted to
our own means of survival.

33:49.939 --> 33:52.909
But that was a scary
thing coming forward like that.

33:54.543 --> 33:57.013
Oh, it's like...

33:57.046 --> 33:58.681
It's really interesting.

33:58.715 --> 34:00.917
It's like I find
that true for myself too.

34:00.950 --> 34:04.887
It's wild, like, that the
scariest part is coming forward.

34:04.921 --> 34:06.889
I don't usually tell
people about all that stuff.

34:07.957 --> 34:09.658
Also, I shouldn't have,

34:09.692 --> 34:11.860
because it was
your second question.

34:11.893 --> 34:13.795
Yes, it was!

34:13.830 --> 34:15.597
I am sorry.
That's my bad.

34:15.630 --> 34:17.364
But I am actually...

34:17.399 --> 34:18.667
I'm glad that you told me.

34:21.871 --> 34:23.906
Alright, next game.

34:23.940 --> 34:26.608
- Car dance off.
- What?

34:26.641 --> 34:28.777
Something
about talking with you,

34:28.811 --> 34:31.947
I'm wonderfully possessed.

34:31.981 --> 34:34.315
Car dance off?

35:02.979 --> 35:05.748
I take it we are here?

35:05.782 --> 35:06.949
I think we are.

35:11.586 --> 35:14.523
Grippin' that steering
wheel pretty tight.

35:14.556 --> 35:15.958
You sure
you don't want your gun?

35:15.992 --> 35:17.526
No, you can keep it.

35:19.862 --> 35:21.363
Look, we don't have to...

35:21.396 --> 35:22.732
We don't have
to go in, you know?

35:22.765 --> 35:24.801
I mean, I would be
more than happy

35:24.834 --> 35:28.503
just taking a walk by the river,
getting to know you better.

35:29.972 --> 35:31.774
That's sweet, and I know.

35:33.642 --> 35:35.477
No one ever made memories
by playing it safe.

35:36.946 --> 35:38.613
There's an upstairs
room I wanna show you.

35:38.647 --> 35:42.584
All right,
I will bring the gun.

36:10.112 --> 36:13.515
This place is pretty
boarded and chained up, huh?

36:13.548 --> 36:15.751
It's to prevent
an infestation.

36:20.022 --> 36:23.558
All right,
talked a lot of shit earlier,

36:23.592 --> 36:25.627
I will go in first.

36:25.660 --> 36:27.797
You don't have to do that.

36:27.830 --> 36:30.398
Nothing to
be afraid of, right?

36:30.432 --> 36:31.901
Thank you.

37:09.872 --> 37:10.940
Max?

37:12.975 --> 37:14.676
Hello?

37:14.710 --> 37:16.478
Max, this isn't funny.

37:17.680 --> 37:18.881
Ha!

37:18.915 --> 37:20.515
Oh, my God!

37:20.548 --> 37:22.151
What the hell?

37:22.184 --> 37:23.853
That was awesome!

37:23.886 --> 37:25.187
Sorry.

37:25.221 --> 37:28.124
Don't do shit like that.

37:30.092 --> 37:31.894
Oh, sorry.

37:31.928 --> 37:34.830
Really old and creepy.

37:36.832 --> 37:39.802
So I'm doin' all right
for our first date?

37:39.835 --> 37:42.038
You could say that.

37:42.071 --> 37:45.708
It's been abandoned
for half a decade.

37:45.741 --> 37:48.744
For the town,
it's a place to be ignored.

37:48.778 --> 37:50.913
What's the story behind it?

37:50.947 --> 37:52.514
A ghost story?

37:52.547 --> 37:54.016
You wanna hear the ghost story?

37:54.050 --> 37:57.853
Well, I got my
white tickets, right?

37:57.887 --> 38:00.156
Okay, but shots first.

38:00.189 --> 38:02.624
Makes the story
more entertaining.

38:02.657 --> 38:04.659
Don't build
it up too much now.

38:13.069 --> 38:17.106
All right,
so they him Rotcreep.

38:17.139 --> 38:19.275
Rotcreep?

38:19.308 --> 38:20.608
Look,
Stephen King doesn't write

38:20.642 --> 38:21.944
small town urban legends.

38:21.978 --> 38:23.746
That's just what
he's called, okay?

38:23.779 --> 38:25.613
That's actually exactly
what Stephen King writes,

38:25.647 --> 38:28.184
but okay, please continue.

38:28.217 --> 38:32.855
Okay, so story goes...

38:32.888 --> 38:37.159
Once a year,
his hunger must be satisfied,

38:37.193 --> 38:41.731
one victim, or he'll act out
beyond these walls.

38:41.764 --> 38:44.300
You don't
actually believe this, right?

38:44.333 --> 38:46.802
Of course I do.

38:46.836 --> 38:48.838
I'll show you upstairs
where they say it all started.

38:48.871 --> 38:51.807
That's where Rotcreep
claimed his very first victims.

38:58.781 --> 38:59.949
What the hell was that?

38:59.982 --> 39:01.784
Hello?

39:01.817 --> 39:04.720
Raccoon, maybe?

39:04.754 --> 39:08.858
Yeah, so much
for preventing an infestation.

39:10.326 --> 39:12.161
Let's go up.

39:12.194 --> 39:13.763
You have the gun, don't you?

39:16.664 --> 39:18.234
All right.

39:18.267 --> 39:20.635
All right, Avery,
you officially got me

39:20.668 --> 39:23.139
out of my comfort zone.

39:23.172 --> 39:26.208
Well, it feels good to feel
something every once in a while.

39:55.071 --> 39:58.174
Not much different from
my room growing up, actually.

39:58.207 --> 40:00.076
Oh, yeah?

40:00.109 --> 40:03.746
Yeah, I mean, minus
all these wrestling posters.

40:03.779 --> 40:06.182
Who really up
and leaves all this stuff?

40:06.215 --> 40:08.851
You mean,
the fancy wrestling posters?

40:10.152 --> 40:11.687
True.

40:19.661 --> 40:21.297
Come look at these.

40:32.341 --> 40:35.111
Kids who lost their mom.

40:35.144 --> 40:37.179
Why are you showing me it?

40:37.213 --> 40:41.016
My buddy, Dave, would sure
approve of you guilt tripping me.

40:41.050 --> 40:44.153
Certainly not my motive.

40:44.186 --> 40:47.423
Sometimes there's more
reality than what's farfetched.

40:47.456 --> 40:48.891
Have a look.

41:02.371 --> 41:05.241
Rotcreep.

41:05.274 --> 41:07.042
Told you I didn't
make up the name.

41:10.312 --> 41:15.151
Looks like this kid's
got more demons than the house.

41:15.184 --> 41:16.785
The house is just a vessel.

41:18.787 --> 41:20.322
What do you mean?

41:20.356 --> 41:23.359
Apparently,
Rotcreep is bound to the house,

41:23.392 --> 41:24.426
as long as it's fed.

41:26.962 --> 41:30.733
Right, right,
once a year, you mentioned.

41:30.766 --> 41:32.935
Now you're qualified
to give the ghost tour.

41:35.004 --> 41:38.040
Yeah, next,
you're gonna tell me,

41:38.073 --> 41:41.177
well, we both know exactly
what you're going to say,

41:41.210 --> 41:44.480
tonight, he is needing
to feed , right?

41:44.513 --> 41:46.749
All good ghost stories
escalate quickly?

41:49.952 --> 41:51.320
Come sit on the bed with me.

41:54.423 --> 41:57.493
Okay, um, look.

41:57.526 --> 42:01.463
You know, I know I said,
I don't believe in ghosts,

42:01.497 --> 42:05.201
but I'm starting to think whether I believe
doesn't matter all that much to the ghost.

42:05.234 --> 42:08.304
Just sit for one moment,
then we'll go. I promise.

42:20.382 --> 42:22.418
- I'm good.
- You sure?

42:22.451 --> 42:27.022
Yeah, I'm just...
having second thoughts.

42:27.056 --> 42:29.391
I know, there's just
something that I wanna say.

42:34.029 --> 42:36.465
Um...

42:36.498 --> 42:38.901
I think I'm really
starting to like you.

42:38.934 --> 42:40.436
You're a good guy, Max.

42:40.469 --> 42:41.837
You're a good guy.

42:44.206 --> 42:46.342
Thank you for saying so.

42:46.375 --> 42:48.811
I haven't really
heard that in a while,

42:48.844 --> 42:50.879
as you could imagine.

42:54.283 --> 42:55.784
Are you...

42:55.818 --> 42:58.854
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

42:58.887 --> 43:00.456
There's just something
that I haven't told you,

43:00.489 --> 43:02.224
and it's a lot worse

43:02.258 --> 43:04.126
than not being the manager
of that movie theater.

43:06.262 --> 43:08.230
Uh...

43:08.264 --> 43:11.033
You remember my paper on "The
Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas"?

43:12.368 --> 43:14.370
Yeah, yeah.

43:14.403 --> 43:16.538
Well, a number of years ago,

43:16.572 --> 43:19.174
I had a similar
decision to make,

43:19.208 --> 43:21.510
my family versus a stranger.

43:23.245 --> 43:25.447
Okay.

43:25.481 --> 43:29.418
I think that my paper has always
been a way of justifying my guilt.

43:29.451 --> 43:33.889
I guess you could say,
I decided not to walk away.

43:37.226 --> 43:39.261
Okay.

43:39.295 --> 43:42.064
You're really
starting to weird me out.

43:42.097 --> 43:44.033
But you understand,

43:44.066 --> 43:46.468
because of what you went through
with your mom, don't you?

43:46.502 --> 43:49.071
Because of your past?

43:49.104 --> 43:52.441
Whatever happens, don't
think that this is easy for me.

43:52.474 --> 43:57.212
See, Max, this
isn't just any home.

43:57.246 --> 43:59.048
This is my childhood home.

44:10.025 --> 44:11.427
I thought you said
he'd go down!

44:11.460 --> 44:13.028
- Sorry, Max.
- I thought he would.

44:13.062 --> 44:14.630
Whoa, don't!
You get out of my way!

44:14.663 --> 44:17.099
Out of my way!
I'm leaving right now!

44:17.132 --> 44:19.201
- That's not gonna happen, Max.
- We told you all this to prepare you, Max.

44:19.234 --> 44:21.270
You asked about the scariest
thing that's ever happened to me.

44:21.303 --> 44:22.971
I'm afraid it's still happening.

44:23.005 --> 44:24.406
We ran from this place
as soon as we could,

44:24.440 --> 44:26.275
as far as we could,
as fast as we could,

44:26.308 --> 44:28.010
but it didn't matter.

44:28.043 --> 44:31.113
Rotcreep always came for us,
until we realized

44:31.146 --> 44:34.016
that someone could take Phillip's
place here in this house,

44:34.049 --> 44:37.319
and be his new... interest.

44:37.353 --> 44:40.923
I use the word stalker earlier to
put it in terms you'd understand.

44:40.956 --> 44:43.492
He died, but that didn't stop
him from coming after Philip.

44:43.525 --> 44:45.294
The same habits
in life as in death.

44:45.327 --> 44:46.929
We dropped a kid
here just last week,

44:46.962 --> 44:48.330
and thought
Phillip would be safe again,

44:48.364 --> 44:51.033
but it seems
Rotcreep it still hungry.

44:51.066 --> 44:52.334
And when he doesn't
get what he wants,

44:52.368 --> 44:55.104
he comes for me, wherever I am.

44:58.474 --> 45:00.175
Happened this morning.

45:00.209 --> 45:02.244
I barely got away.

45:02.277 --> 45:08.150
Just one touch
rots you from the outside in.

45:08.183 --> 45:11.053
For what it's worth,
it's not personal, man.

45:11.086 --> 45:13.655
We're just trying to stay alive.

45:13.690 --> 45:15.224
Stop, stop!

45:15.257 --> 45:17.694
Stop, stop!

45:17.727 --> 45:19.194
You step out of
the way right now,

45:19.228 --> 45:20.429
and I'm...

45:31.407 --> 45:34.543
Blanks, so you'd feel safe.

45:34.576 --> 45:37.312
In case her nice tits
weren't enough.

45:37.346 --> 45:40.048
- Avery?
- I'm sorry, Max.

45:40.082 --> 45:41.350
Sorry, Max.

45:54.396 --> 45:56.365
See,
I told you he'd go down.

46:00.636 --> 46:02.304
I'll get his legs.

46:13.615 --> 46:15.184
Zip ties.

46:27.396 --> 46:28.997
Pull him closer.

46:50.753 --> 46:52.087
Don't get too turned on now.

46:52.120 --> 46:54.189
Shut up, Phillip!

47:03.232 --> 47:06.568
Broke ass mother fucker!

47:07.669 --> 47:09.271
It's not working!

47:28.357 --> 47:29.826
Really?

47:31.293 --> 47:34.062
- Sorry, Max.
- Avery, come on!

47:44.406 --> 47:47.209
When you wake up, drink this.

47:47.242 --> 47:50.379
It'll make things easier,
trust me.

47:50.412 --> 47:52.614
I assure you, it'll be a hell
of a lot shorter than Phillip's,

47:52.648 --> 47:55.183
and maybe mine.

47:55.217 --> 47:57.820
You're about to
understand it all.

49:03.886 --> 49:06.355
Help!

50:05.682 --> 50:06.683
Hey, just stay back!

50:16.859 --> 50:18.695
I'm not gonna hurt you.

50:20.529 --> 50:22.564
All right?

50:22.597 --> 50:24.199
You just come out.

50:25.400 --> 50:26.501
You come out.

50:27.636 --> 50:28.805
That's right.

50:34.643 --> 50:37.612
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.

50:37.646 --> 50:39.514
Whoa.

50:39.548 --> 50:41.349
Hi.

50:41.383 --> 50:42.685
Hi.

50:42.719 --> 50:44.519
I'm not gonna
hurt you, that's...

50:44.553 --> 50:45.855
My name's Max.

51:04.741 --> 51:06.008
This is yours?

51:10.579 --> 51:12.949
Okay, okay, who are you, kid?

51:12.982 --> 51:14.316
Who are you?

51:14.349 --> 51:15.985
Like I said, my name is Max.

51:17.552 --> 51:19.287
How long
you been hiding in there?

51:20.790 --> 51:22.925
I don't know.

51:22.959 --> 51:25.895
All right, well,
how did you get here?

51:25.928 --> 51:27.562
That girl.

51:30.967 --> 51:33.568
Avery, she brought you here?

51:38.573 --> 51:39.809
All right, listen.

51:41.409 --> 51:42.879
I already tried that!

51:46.515 --> 51:47.984
No, no, no, don't open it!

51:48.017 --> 51:49.819
He'll get you!

51:49.852 --> 51:51.486
It?

51:51.520 --> 51:53.856
Rotcreep.

51:56.058 --> 51:59.028
- I'm just gonna make sure the coast is clear, okay?
- No, no, no, no.

52:11.540 --> 52:14.010
The hallway's empty.

52:14.043 --> 52:15.711
It's okay.

52:17.680 --> 52:19.882
What the hell was that?

52:21.684 --> 52:23.753
You think I didn't
try to open the door already?

52:23.786 --> 52:27.690
I told you.
You didn't listen!

52:27.723 --> 52:30.760
It doesn't care
if you believe in it or not.

52:45.775 --> 52:48.610
Do you have anything to drink?

52:48.643 --> 52:50.545
Only this.

52:52.682 --> 52:54.616
That's for adults!

52:56.052 --> 52:58.120
Ew!

52:59.521 --> 53:01.891
What is that, gasoline?

53:05.027 --> 53:06.661
You weren't
supposed to drink that.

53:08.764 --> 53:12.534
Taste like... burning.

53:14.203 --> 53:17.173
Okay, how the hell
do I get outta here?

53:17.206 --> 53:19.141
We don't!

53:27.649 --> 53:28.684
Hey!

53:30.119 --> 53:32.121
Hey, I'm sorry. Okay?

53:32.154 --> 53:34.690
Clearly, you weren't
supposed to be here,

53:34.724 --> 53:36.424
but you still are.
All right?

53:36.458 --> 53:37.425
You're doing something right.

53:37.459 --> 53:38.526
I'm sorry.

53:40.662 --> 53:42.031
All right?

53:45.735 --> 53:49.571
My dad has to pour drinks...

53:50.907 --> 53:52.875
Okay.

53:52.909 --> 53:54.110
Okay.

53:54.143 --> 53:56.145
So what do we do?

53:56.178 --> 53:58.881
Out there,
it's all boarded up.

53:58.915 --> 54:01.083
Every window, every door!

54:01.117 --> 54:05.654
There's not enough room
for both of us to hide.

54:05.688 --> 54:08.024
You've been hiding in there
this whole time?

54:08.057 --> 54:10.159
I tried to go in the kitchen,

54:10.192 --> 54:14.596
but that was a bad idea
going down there.

54:14.629 --> 54:16.699
- What happened?
- You don't wanna find out.

54:16.732 --> 54:19.835
But whatever happens,
stay away from his bedroom!

54:19.869 --> 54:21.704
Never go into his room.

54:28.778 --> 54:33.115
Okay.

54:33.149 --> 54:36.584
Okay, well, I'm glad
that you're able to get away.

54:36.618 --> 54:40.856
Even my house cat plays
with mice before it kills them.

54:40.890 --> 54:42.657
Remember, you're here now.

54:44.260 --> 54:46.494
Yeah.

54:46.528 --> 54:47.897
Yeah.

54:47.930 --> 54:49.732
Okay.

54:49.765 --> 54:52.168
Hey, you never
told me your name.

54:52.201 --> 54:53.703
It's Rudy.

54:53.736 --> 54:55.938
- Rudy, son of Sam Quincy.
- Mm-hmm.

54:55.972 --> 54:57.239
I lost my bike.

54:57.273 --> 54:59.041
Avery said
she knew where it was.

55:00.776 --> 55:02.778
She...

55:02.812 --> 55:04.612
And now, I'm here.

55:04.646 --> 55:05.848
Okay.

55:05.881 --> 55:07.683
All right, Rudy.

55:07.717 --> 55:10.518
Okay, let's get you back
up on your feet, all right?

55:10.552 --> 55:12.254
And let's try to
get out of this together.

55:12.288 --> 55:14.924
You think we can do this?

55:14.957 --> 55:16.258
Put out your hand.

55:18.060 --> 55:21.130
Little fingers can't break open
windows and doors.

55:21.163 --> 55:24.066
These,
however, along with these,

55:24.100 --> 55:25.301
we got a chance!

55:25.334 --> 55:26.836
Faith?

55:26.869 --> 55:29.138
What?

55:29.171 --> 55:32.507
My mom said when you're down
you have to have faith.

55:34.910 --> 55:37.179
All right.

55:37.213 --> 55:40.082
All right, I guess
it's not such bad advice.

55:40.116 --> 55:41.784
So you're with me?

55:41.817 --> 55:43.585
Yeah?

55:43.618 --> 55:44.652
All right.

55:44.687 --> 55:45.653
Hey, that doesn't work.

55:45.688 --> 55:47.555
Hey!

55:47.589 --> 55:48.691
Hey, trust me.

55:48.724 --> 55:51.559
- Okay?
- Okay.

55:51.593 --> 55:53.829
Okay, Rudy.

55:53.863 --> 55:55.164
All right, when I open it,

55:55.197 --> 55:57.299
no hesitations, okay?

55:57.333 --> 56:00.202
We're walking straight out
and down the stairs.

56:00.236 --> 56:02.238
- You got it?
- Got it.

56:02.271 --> 56:04.774
I guess we're supposed to be tied
up and not running around together?

56:04.807 --> 56:06.142
That's right.

56:09.677 --> 56:10.746
The hallway's empty.

56:10.780 --> 56:12.081
Okay.

56:12.114 --> 56:13.648
On three.

56:13.682 --> 56:16.719
One, two...

56:16.752 --> 56:17.987
Okay.

56:18.020 --> 56:19.288
Go, go, go, go!

56:26.128 --> 56:28.130
Help me with this one!

56:29.298 --> 56:30.598
That's on too tight.

56:30.632 --> 56:32.334
It's way too tight.

56:32.368 --> 56:34.236
Now, you cover
your ears, all right?

56:40.976 --> 56:42.610
Wow!

56:42.644 --> 56:44.046
Just a few more,
and then we push it.

56:44.080 --> 56:45.381
Come on!
Squeeze through, Rudy!

56:49.251 --> 56:50.886
- Come on!
- More!

56:50.920 --> 56:52.088
Not goin' in!

56:52.121 --> 56:53.222
Squeeze through!

56:53.255 --> 56:54.256
- Come on, push!
- You!

56:54.290 --> 56:55.324
Push!

56:55.357 --> 56:56.692
Come on!

56:58.127 --> 56:59.195
I'm coming!

57:01.330 --> 57:02.932
Run! Run!

57:02.965 --> 57:04.066
The hell?

57:04.100 --> 57:05.734
Rudy? What are you doing?

57:05.768 --> 57:07.803
Oh, my!
Phillip, get him!

57:07.837 --> 57:09.371
Max, you should not have
let the boy take your place.

57:09.405 --> 57:11.373
Avery, Avery,
you let me

57:11.407 --> 57:13.675
- outta here right now.
- There's still no way out of this!

57:13.709 --> 57:15.277
- Please, Avery, please.
- I'm sorry. I wish it were that easy!

57:15.311 --> 57:16.812
- I'm begging you! I'm begging you, please!
- I can't, Max!

57:23.352 --> 57:25.221
I'm not gonna act
like I didn't deserve that.

57:27.223 --> 57:29.692
I'm gonna make sure
to get Rudy back for you.

59:39.822 --> 59:40.789
Wait, wait!

59:40.823 --> 59:42.157
Wait, wait!

59:42.191 --> 59:44.326
No, no, no, no!

59:44.360 --> 59:45.794
No, no!

59:45.828 --> 59:46.962
No!

01:02:01.063 --> 01:02:04.066
<i>Go on. Why don't you
tell Daddy what you're doing?</i>

01:02:04.099 --> 01:02:05.467
<i>It's just Oscar, Daddy.</i>

01:02:05.501 --> 01:02:07.236
<i>I'm teaching him how to swim.</i>

01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:09.204
<i>I'm not sure
if robots know how to swim,</i>

01:02:09.238 --> 01:02:11.306
<i>but I just wanted
to win the race.</i>

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.275
<i>That's cute.</i>

01:02:13.308 --> 01:02:15.043
<i>Are you gonna win your swim
meet tomorrow, Phillip?</i>

01:02:15.077 --> 01:02:17.513
<i>How 'bout you come
teach Daddy how to swim?</i>

01:02:17.546 --> 01:02:20.115
<i>I'll make a change
to my swimsuit, Phillip.</i>

01:02:20.149 --> 01:02:23.252
<i>Daddy, Phillip,
are you two down there?</i>

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:29.958
<i>Creep.</i>

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.535
Go on!

01:03:48.337 --> 01:03:50.038
Remember, Max...

01:03:50.072 --> 01:03:51.273
...Rotcreep only needs
one of you!

01:03:56.411 --> 01:03:59.248
I'm sorry, Max!

01:03:59.281 --> 01:04:00.783
I'm sorry!

01:04:00.817 --> 01:04:03.285
I really tried to
get away and get help.

01:04:23.472 --> 01:04:26.141
I know, buddy.

01:04:26.174 --> 01:04:27.242
I know.

01:04:28.811 --> 01:04:30.546
I really tried.

01:04:30.579 --> 01:04:33.515
I know, but you remember
what I told you earlier?

01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:37.352
The same goes
for your legs, all right?

01:04:37.386 --> 01:04:40.155
How are you supposed to
outrun someone twice your size?

01:04:40.188 --> 01:04:42.157
Because I'm smarter.

01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:47.095
That may be true,

01:04:47.129 --> 01:04:48.397
but there's two of them.

01:04:50.532 --> 01:04:53.468
Two people twice your size.

01:04:53.502 --> 01:04:55.270
So you're still alive?

01:04:56.839 --> 01:04:59.274
What's that supposed to mean?

01:04:59.308 --> 01:05:02.779
I'm happy
you're still alive, truly.

01:05:13.288 --> 01:05:15.725
Okay, come on.

01:05:18.226 --> 01:05:21.864
Let's get you
cleaned up, all right?

01:05:35.912 --> 01:05:37.546
I'm worried
about my mom right now.

01:05:37.579 --> 01:05:39.448
Hey, you be
strong for me, okay?

01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:40.482
Take this off.

01:05:42.317 --> 01:05:43.920
Do you think
your mom is worried about you?

01:05:43.953 --> 01:05:47.724
Can you stop asking me
so many questions, please?

01:05:47.757 --> 01:05:49.424
Can you do that for me?

01:05:49.458 --> 01:05:51.393
- Okay.
- Thank you, buddy.

01:06:11.213 --> 01:06:13.215
Are you okay, Max?

01:06:13.248 --> 01:06:14.416
I'm fine.

01:06:14.449 --> 01:06:15.718
Rudy, I'm fine.

01:06:15.752 --> 01:06:17.386
...in her net too!

01:06:17.419 --> 01:06:18.821
I said, "I'm fine"!

01:06:26.662 --> 01:06:28.430
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:06:28.463 --> 01:06:30.365
I'm sorry.

01:06:30.399 --> 01:06:31.768
Okay?

01:06:33.803 --> 01:06:35.604
I didn't mean to snap at you.

01:06:35.637 --> 01:06:37.372
It's okay.

01:06:37.406 --> 01:06:40.208
I knew when you said
you were fine, you weren't.

01:06:40.242 --> 01:06:44.446
Just because you're grown doesn't
mean that you don't need help too.

01:06:49.786 --> 01:06:50.820
Yeah.

01:06:52.287 --> 01:06:53.856
I think you're right about that.

01:06:56.025 --> 01:07:01.731
It's just me... trying
to be stoic, till I'm not.

01:07:01.764 --> 01:07:03.665
Stoic?

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:04.734
It's...

01:07:07.602 --> 01:07:08.871
It doesn't matter.

01:07:08.905 --> 01:07:11.673
It matters to me, Max.

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.015
All right.

01:07:19.048 --> 01:07:20.382
All right.

01:07:20.415 --> 01:07:21.483
Come on!

01:07:25.855 --> 01:07:27.355
What you did for me...

01:07:27.389 --> 01:07:28.657
I should go back
to the hiding place.

01:07:28.691 --> 01:07:30.592
Yeah, I hear ya.

01:07:30.625 --> 01:07:32.527
What is all this stuff?

01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:34.831
It's the dad's video camera.

01:07:34.864 --> 01:07:36.665
You mean, Rotcreep's?

01:07:36.699 --> 01:07:38.333
You know, too?

01:07:38.366 --> 01:07:39.736
I may have little fingers
and short legs,

01:07:39.769 --> 01:07:42.270
but like I told you, I'm smart.

01:07:42.304 --> 01:07:45.842
I know you are, buddy.

01:07:47.043 --> 01:07:49.478
Hey!

01:07:49.511 --> 01:07:51.881
- Hey, I need to go check out this last room.
- No, no, no!

01:07:51.914 --> 01:07:53.448
Don't leave me, Max!

01:07:53.482 --> 01:07:54.984
Can you hide until I get back?

01:07:55.017 --> 01:07:56.719
I'll just be a moment.
Can you do that for me?

01:07:56.753 --> 01:07:58.721
Like I said,
I'm an expert hider.

01:07:58.755 --> 01:07:59.722
Yeah.

01:07:59.756 --> 01:08:01.389
Show me, come on!

01:08:06.428 --> 01:08:07.864
Do you see me?

01:08:07.897 --> 01:08:08.998
Not at all.

01:08:10.332 --> 01:08:11.299
See?

01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:12.400
Told you.

01:08:14.536 --> 01:08:16.839
You stay there, all right?

01:09:37.819 --> 01:09:38.955
- Wait!
- Wait!

01:09:38.988 --> 01:09:40.790
- Wait!
- Run, Max!

01:09:40.823 --> 01:09:41.957
Rudy!

01:09:41.991 --> 01:09:43.125
- Wait!
- Rudy!

01:09:43.158 --> 01:09:44.160
Max!

01:09:44.193 --> 01:09:45.493
No, please!

01:09:45.527 --> 01:09:46.493
Please!

01:09:46.528 --> 01:09:47.595
Help!

01:09:48.662 --> 01:09:49.866
Help!

01:09:50.899 --> 01:09:53.135
Max!

01:09:53.169 --> 01:09:56.404
Max!

01:10:03.645 --> 01:10:04.780
Max!

01:10:06.849 --> 01:10:08.784
Max!

01:10:40.649 --> 01:10:42.484
Max!

01:10:43.219 --> 01:10:44.987
Max!

01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:50.993
Please, help!

01:10:52.627 --> 01:10:54.163
Please, Max!

01:11:14.884 --> 01:11:16.052
Get off of him!

01:11:16.085 --> 01:11:17.687
Get the fuck away from him!

01:12:16.946 --> 01:12:18.180
Rudy?

01:12:18.214 --> 01:12:23.185
Rudy?

01:12:26.722 --> 01:12:28.090
Where were you?

01:12:32.828 --> 01:12:35.998
I know.

01:12:36.032 --> 01:12:37.632
Rudy, Rudy, I'm sorry.

01:12:40.803 --> 01:12:43.339
Hey, we're
gonna get out of this.

01:12:43.372 --> 01:12:44.639
Okay?

01:12:56.752 --> 01:12:57.853
Rudy!

01:15:13.489 --> 01:15:17.092

into Sally Dotter today.</i>

01:16:35.304 --> 01:16:36.972

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.215

01:20:41.416 --> 01:20:44.186
How many cigarettes
do you have?

01:20:45.254 --> 01:20:47.222
- Huh?
- A pack.

01:20:54.831 --> 01:20:56.565
How much longer?

01:20:56.598 --> 01:20:58.701
Not until we know for sure
it's done this time.

01:21:02.237 --> 01:21:04.439
We should have cameras
inside to watch it unfold.

01:21:04.473 --> 01:21:06.074
I don't like that idea.

01:21:06.809 --> 01:21:08.110
Why?

01:21:08.143 --> 01:21:09.645
I just don't.

01:21:22.825 --> 01:21:25.594
I wonder if Max
is gonna survive this?

01:21:25.627 --> 01:21:28.831
How much
do you really like this guy?

01:21:28.865 --> 01:21:32.334
I told you, I didn't wanna do this
shit with him in the first place.

01:21:32.367 --> 01:21:34.236
We really have
something between us.

01:21:34.269 --> 01:21:36.371
Wow!
Well, if that were the case,

01:21:36.405 --> 01:21:39.107
you wouldn't have
locked him in there to die.

01:21:39.141 --> 01:21:41.510
Like you gave me much choice?

01:21:41.543 --> 01:21:44.681
What, you think that it's easy
dating with a brother like you?

01:21:44.714 --> 01:21:47.549
- Fuck you!
- I'm just saying.

01:21:47.583 --> 01:21:50.218
Well, there's a whole
big world on Ember, Avery.

01:21:50.252 --> 01:21:52.654
So suck it up,
and swipe right again!

01:21:52.689 --> 01:21:55.390
Max can't make it out alive.
You know that, right?

01:21:56.258 --> 01:21:58.460
Fuck you!

01:21:58.493 --> 01:22:01.898
Our secret can't get out.
You know that, right?

01:22:01.931 --> 01:22:03.665
- I know!
- What?

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:05.334
I said, "I know", Phil!

01:22:08.203 --> 01:22:09.739
What the hell was that?

01:22:09.772 --> 01:22:11.506
Come on!

01:22:16.178 --> 01:22:17.179
He did it.

01:22:17.212 --> 01:22:18.280
- He's out.
- Shit.

01:22:18.313 --> 01:22:19.682
Where is he?

01:22:19.716 --> 01:22:21.249
Phillip?

01:22:25.621 --> 01:22:26.689
Rudy?

01:22:31.961 --> 01:22:33.696
It's done!

01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:35.464
We're safe again!

01:22:36.899 --> 01:22:38.901
I'm safe!

01:22:38.935 --> 01:22:41.871
Where is Max?

01:22:41.904 --> 01:22:43.639
Can you come and
help me with the fucking body?

01:22:43.672 --> 01:22:46.441
Then we can worry
about your damn boyfriend!

01:22:52.414 --> 01:22:54.549
- His face.
- If it bothers you that much

01:22:54.583 --> 01:22:56.418
put something over it.

01:22:56.451 --> 01:22:58.587
That's better.

01:22:58.620 --> 01:22:59.822
Come on.

01:23:01.456 --> 01:23:03.291
Max?

01:23:03.325 --> 01:23:06.829
Max, let us out!

01:23:08.731 --> 01:23:12.200
Max? Max, open the door!

01:23:13.335 --> 01:23:15.470
This is for Rudy.

01:23:15.504 --> 01:23:17.774
Max, you know, we really were
supposed to go to the movie tonight.

01:23:17.807 --> 01:23:21.376
The only thing that I was hiding was that
I wished it was a date the whole time.

01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:22.945
Phillip called
in the bomb threat

01:23:22.979 --> 01:23:24.714
only when he realized
that he was still in danger.

01:23:24.747 --> 01:23:27.784
It was supposed to only involve
Rudy from the start, Max.

01:23:27.817 --> 01:23:29.618
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

01:23:29.651 --> 01:23:31.553
I'm saying sorry, Max.

01:23:31.586 --> 01:23:33.321
Now, what started between us
really means something to me.

01:23:33.355 --> 01:23:35.490
She wants your dick, Max!
Isn't that enough?

01:23:35.524 --> 01:23:37.359
- Just let us out!
- Please, I'm begging you!

01:23:37.392 --> 01:23:39.461
Max! We can keep
this secret together.

01:23:39.494 --> 01:23:43.198
It's the only thing that Philip and
I could do to keep sane to survive.

01:23:44.466 --> 01:23:45.835
Avery?

01:23:45.868 --> 01:23:47.469
Yeah, what is it, Max?
Tell me, please.

01:23:47.502 --> 01:23:49.872
I'm here to listen.

01:23:49.906 --> 01:23:53.009
You realize
what you've become, don't you?

01:23:53.042 --> 01:23:55.377
Shut up, Max,
and just let us out!

01:23:55.410 --> 01:23:57.479
Max, take my hand, please.
I swear I'm not gonna hurt you again.

01:23:57.512 --> 01:23:59.347
I don't think

01:23:59.381 --> 01:24:00.783
there's gonna be
a second date, Avery!

01:24:00.817 --> 01:24:02.284
Relax.
Max, come on.

01:24:02.317 --> 01:24:03.518
Come on, Max.

01:24:05.722 --> 01:24:10.325
I've been thinking about your
little writing project, your paper.

01:24:11.994 --> 01:24:14.964
In Omelas, you said,
"There's only two options",

01:24:14.997 --> 01:24:18.233
running, looking the other way,

01:24:20.302 --> 01:24:22.805
but there's a third way
to stop this one.

01:24:22.839 --> 01:24:24.439
What is it, Max?

01:24:24.473 --> 01:24:26.541
Tell me, please!
Just let us out!

01:24:26.575 --> 01:24:28.811
- Just open the damn door!
- Come on, Max.

01:24:28.845 --> 01:24:31.814
Max, just open it, please.
I am begging you!

01:24:31.848 --> 01:24:34.282
Max, don't do this.
Don't do this, Max. Max, Max!

01:24:34.316 --> 01:24:35.785
- Max, wait!
- Let us out!

01:24:35.818 --> 01:24:37.820
- Open the door!
- I'm sorry!

01:24:37.854 --> 01:24:39.454
- Max, please, Max!
- Please open the chain!

01:24:39.488 --> 01:24:40.790
Max!
What are you doing?

01:24:40.823 --> 01:24:41.924
- Max!
- Max, open it!

01:24:41.958 --> 01:24:43.025
- Max!
- Max!

01:24:44.827 --> 01:24:45.862
Max, don't leave me here!

01:24:45.895 --> 01:24:47.029
Please!

01:24:47.063 --> 01:24:48.363
- Max, please!
- Come on!

01:24:48.396 --> 01:24:49.932
- Max!
- Max, come back!

01:24:49.966 --> 01:24:51.466
Please!

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.568
- No!
- Max, open it!

01:24:53.602 --> 01:24:56.072
- Max!
- Open the damn door!

01:24:56.105 --> 01:24:58.040
- Max, please!
- Max!

01:24:58.074 --> 01:25:00.943
- Max!
- Max, let us out!

01:25:00.977 --> 01:25:02.979
- Max!
- Somebody help us!

01:25:03.012 --> 01:25:05.948
Let us out!

01:25:05.982 --> 01:25:07.083
- Max!
- Come on!

01:25:07.116 --> 01:25:08.350
- Why?
- Open it!

01:25:08.383 --> 01:25:09.551
Open it, Max!

01:25:09.584 --> 01:25:11.453
Open the damn door!

01:25:11.486 --> 01:25:13.488
- Max!
- Max, let us out!

01:25:13.522 --> 01:25:14.991
- Why?
- Max, please!

01:25:15.024 --> 01:25:16.893
- Help!
- Please, Max!

01:25:16.926 --> 01:25:18.660
Max, don't
leave me here, please!

01:25:18.694 --> 01:25:20.062
Max!

01:25:20.096 --> 01:25:21.663
Max!

01:25:23.099 --> 01:25:25.400
- Max, please!
- Help!

01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:29.872
Open the damn door!

01:25:31.573 --> 01:25:32.842
Max, open it!

01:25:32.875 --> 01:25:33.943
Help!

01:25:33.976 --> 01:25:35.845
Max!

01:25:35.878 --> 01:25:37.412
Max, what are you doing?

01:25:37.445 --> 01:25:39.048
Burning it all down.

01:25:39.081 --> 01:25:40.850
- Max!
- No! Let us out!

01:25:40.883 --> 01:25:42.450
Max, please!

01:25:42.484 --> 01:25:44.319
- Help!
- Please, Max!

01:25:45.688 --> 01:25:47.123
Max!

01:25:47.156 --> 01:25:48.758
- Max!
- Open the door!

01:25:48.791 --> 01:25:50.458
- Help me!
- Max, please!

01:26:23.658 --> 01:26:25.161
- Help!
- Max!

01:26:25.194 --> 01:26:26.963
Somebody help us!

01:27:53.149 --> 01:27:54.183
Mom?

01:27:56.518 --> 01:27:57.552
Mom, it's...

01:27:59.822 --> 01:28:01.523
It's me.

01:28:01.556 --> 01:28:04.026
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:05.728
<i>How are you?</i>

01:28:07.163 --> 01:28:09.597
- Mom, I...
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:28:09.631 --> 01:28:12.001
I've been worried sick!

01:28:12.034 --> 01:28:13.235
I...

01:28:19.775 --> 01:28:20.943
<i>You're what, honey?</i>

01:28:24.679 --> 01:28:27.049
<i>What is it?</i>

01:28:36.292 --> 01:28:38.995
It's just, there's
a lot I have to tell you.

01:28:41.931 --> 01:28:44.900
<i>You don't have to tell me.</i>

01:28:44.934 --> 01:28:46.668
<i>I already know.</i>

01:28:49.805 --> 01:28:52.008
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:56.178
<i>I love you.</i>

01:31:50.452 --> 01:31:51.820
Cut!
