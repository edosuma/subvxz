00:01.933 --> 00:03.166
What you're about to see
could be downright dangerous,

00:03.167 --> 00:04.366
so, a word of advice...

00:04.367 --> 00:06.432
Leave the myth busting to us.

00:06.433 --> 00:10.332
Narrator: On this episode
of "mythbusters"...

00:10.333 --> 00:12.499
Adam: With good reason,
we've spent 10 years

00:12.500 --> 00:14.666
telling you
to not try this at home.

00:14.667 --> 00:17.666
But in this episode,
we've compiled a bunch of things

00:17.667 --> 00:20.366
that we think you might be able
to try at home.

00:20.367 --> 00:21.667
Like this.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.866
Narrator:
Well, not exactly like that,

00:30.867 --> 00:33.166
but after 200 episodes
of saying...

00:33.167 --> 00:35.099
Don't try this at home.
Whoa.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.899
The myth busters are apparently

00:36.900 --> 00:39.699
changing their tune...

00:39.700 --> 00:42.332
To deliver
a diy science special.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.599
Your results may vary.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.066
So, prepare your
safety glasses...

00:47.067 --> 00:48.266
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:48.267 --> 00:49.432
Your pocket protectors...

00:49.433 --> 00:51.566
Oh!
Holy crap!

00:51.567 --> 00:52.567
Narrator:
And your clipboard...

00:52.568 --> 00:54.066
Wow!

00:54.067 --> 00:56.066
Because for this episode,

00:56.067 --> 00:59.399
they're finding myths
you can maybe try at home...

00:59.400 --> 01:02.767
Or maybe not.

01:05.267 --> 01:07.200
Who are the mythbusters?

01:08.467 --> 01:11.299
Adam savage...
It's scientific!

01:11.300 --> 01:12.666
Narrator:
And Jamie hyneman.

01:12.667 --> 01:14.566
Bye-bye!

01:14.567 --> 01:19.366
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:19.367 --> 01:21.399
Together with kari Byron...

01:21.400 --> 01:22.699
The golden dragon!

01:22.700 --> 01:24.799
Tory belleci....

01:24.800 --> 01:26.066
We're gonna die!

01:26.067 --> 01:28.099
And Grant imahara.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.499
Who wants some?!

01:29.500 --> 01:32.232
Narrator:
They don't just tell the myths.

01:32.233 --> 01:34.732
They put them to the test.

01:46.433 --> 01:49.232
okay, so the "do try this
at home?" Special.

01:49.233 --> 01:50.466
Exactly.

01:50.467 --> 01:52.499
Our lawyers are actually okay
with this?

01:52.500 --> 01:54.966
They are, but here's the thrust
of this episode.

01:54.967 --> 01:57.299
We are gonna be testing
a bunch of zany experiments

01:57.300 --> 01:58.432
and viral videos

01:58.433 --> 02:00.766
and assessing, one,
whether or not they're true,

02:00.767 --> 02:04.832
but, two, whether or not they're
actually okay to try at home.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.299
So, some of this may be
actually too dangerous to try?

02:07.300 --> 02:08.399
Yes.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.932
The first one, though, i think

02:09.933 --> 02:11.799
is gonna be pretty easy
to try at home,

02:11.800 --> 02:13.232
and it's a classic...
Microwaved water.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.233
Oh, yeah.

02:14.234 --> 02:16.199
Microwaved water
will kill plants

02:16.200 --> 02:17.666
if you water them with it.

02:17.667 --> 02:18.799
I don't think it's true at all,

02:18.800 --> 02:20.066
and i think we should test it.

02:20.067 --> 02:23.766
It's an Internet myth
that has spread worldwide.

02:23.767 --> 02:26.732
Supposedly,
these pictures are evidence

02:26.733 --> 02:30.499
that water boiled in a microwave
is toxic to plants,

02:30.500 --> 02:34.832
but could that be true
or is this myth in hot water?

02:34.833 --> 02:37.499
Well, if it turns out
you can try this at home,

02:37.500 --> 02:40.632
you'll need the following...

02:40.633 --> 02:42.066
And down in the shop,

02:42.067 --> 02:45.332
Adam's green thumb is prepping
his test of the waters.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.366
So the question
we're gonna answer is,

02:47.367 --> 02:49.466
does microwave-boiled water
kill plants?

02:49.467 --> 02:50.899
Oh.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.166
Very nice.

02:52.167 --> 02:54.399
To determine that,
we are going to expose

02:54.400 --> 02:56.266
some plants to microwave
boiled water, of course.

02:56.267 --> 02:57.632
Beautiful.

02:57.633 --> 02:59.899
We're also gonna compare that
to some other controls.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.699
One will be water boiled
on the stove,

03:01.700 --> 03:03.632
one will be
just regular tap water,

03:03.633 --> 03:05.199
one will be no water at all.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.499
Narrator: And now for the
supposedly toxic ingredient...

03:08.500 --> 03:10.132
The microwave-boiled water.

03:10.133 --> 03:12.166
Obviously,
to conduct this experiment,

03:12.167 --> 03:14.066
you're gonna need
a bunch of water

03:14.067 --> 03:15.899
that's been boiled
in a microwave,

03:15.900 --> 03:17.799
bombarded by those evil
microwaves.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.166
Put it in.

03:19.167 --> 03:22.132
Push the button. Start.
There we go.

03:22.133 --> 03:24.099
Run it for five minutes of
full power, see if that works.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.566
[ Ding! ]

03:25.567 --> 03:27.499
There we go. All right.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.066
Now, as a point of clarity
i want to point out

03:30.067 --> 03:32.899
the myth isn't that plants
don't like boiling water.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.766
For gosh sake, don't pour
boiling water on your plants.

03:35.767 --> 03:38.832
You'll kill them immediately,
like most other living things.

03:38.833 --> 03:42.532
No, let this water cool down
to room temperature

03:42.533 --> 03:45.332
before using it
on a living thing.

03:45.333 --> 03:48.466
Narrator: Well, with his three
types of h2o inside the rig,

03:48.467 --> 03:50.766
he's ready
to get his thumbs green.

03:50.767 --> 03:53.166
Adam: There we go.

03:53.167 --> 03:56.666
So we've used eight
romaine lettuce in four groups,

03:56.667 --> 03:58.099
and we're subjecting
those four groups

03:58.100 --> 04:01.299
to four distinctly different
conditions of water.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.432
Now, that water is coming
from these buckets up here

04:03.433 --> 04:04.599
through these water timers,

04:04.600 --> 04:06.299
and they're all set
to water the plants

04:06.300 --> 04:07.899
for exactly the same amount
of time

04:07.900 --> 04:10.566
and exactly the same amount
of water every single day.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.766
"But wait," you say,
"what about sunlight?"

04:12.767 --> 04:14.299
Ah, we thought of that.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.099
Ta-da! That's the light.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.632
These are actual grow lights.

04:17.633 --> 04:20.366
We're gonna subject our plants
to these grow lights

04:20.367 --> 04:23.366
for about 16 hours a day,
a really nice vibrant sunlight,

04:23.367 --> 04:25.566
and we'll log their growth
on this chart here.

04:25.567 --> 04:27.732
After a week, i swear
we should see a difference.

04:27.733 --> 04:28.932
After a couple of weeks,

04:28.933 --> 04:30.932
i think this test
is gonna be pretty definitive.

04:30.933 --> 04:34.166
Narrator: But as exciting
as it is to watch lettuce grow,

04:34.167 --> 04:38.299
let's fast forward
one week into the future.

04:38.300 --> 04:42.399
All right, let's see how
everyone's been doing.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.966
[ Laughs ]

04:43.967 --> 04:45.099
Look at that.

04:45.100 --> 04:47.166
9.25.

04:47.167 --> 04:51.832
The microwave-boiled water
is outgrowing everything else.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.699
It was around 5 1/2 inches,

04:53.700 --> 04:56.399
and now it's
over nine inches tall.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.266
Right now, it's not looking
very good for the myth.

04:59.267 --> 05:01.766
Narrator: It's a drastically
different result

05:01.767 --> 05:03.332
from those viral photos.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.299
But why exactly
would people believe

05:05.300 --> 05:09.766
that water boiled in
a microwave oven is dangerous?

05:09.767 --> 05:11.966
In a word, radiation.

05:11.967 --> 05:14.532
Microwaves are a form
of electromagnetic radiation,

05:14.533 --> 05:17.166
but they're on the less harmful
end of the spectrum.

05:17.167 --> 05:20.332
Microwaves work by vibrating
water molecules

05:20.333 --> 05:22.966
around 2.45 billion times
a second.

05:22.967 --> 05:25.532
This vibration is then converted
to thermal energy,

05:25.533 --> 05:28.432
and what you get is a quick
and efficient way to heat food.

05:28.433 --> 05:31.366
But no radiation is imparted
during the process

05:31.367 --> 05:33.332
and, theoretically,
microwave-boiled water

05:33.333 --> 05:35.432
is no different than water
boiled on a stove.

05:35.433 --> 05:37.299
Still, we're gonna give it
another week

05:37.300 --> 05:38.532
and let's see what happens.

05:38.533 --> 05:41.066
Narrator:
So, after two weeks of growth,

05:41.067 --> 05:44.332
Adam is let loose amongst
the lettuce for the last time.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.632
What we wanted to determine
was whether microwave water

05:46.633 --> 05:48.566
was dangerous, and i think,
definitively,

05:48.567 --> 05:49.799
we've proved that it's not.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.800
Look at this.

05:50.801 --> 05:52.966
This is the healthiest plant
in here.

05:52.967 --> 05:55.332
Both of these, they're higher
than any of the others,

05:55.333 --> 05:57.566
and they got
the microwave-boiled water.

05:57.567 --> 05:58.766
They're totally fine.

05:58.767 --> 06:01.099
Oh, and we also determined
that no water

06:01.100 --> 06:03.699
is really, really crappy
for plants,

06:03.700 --> 06:05.832
so note that you brown thumbs.

06:05.833 --> 06:09.166
Narrator: It may be busted,
but don't take our word for it.

06:09.167 --> 06:11.433
Try this at home.

06:16.467 --> 06:21.067
Next up,
some emergency firefighting.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.266
All right, so first up
is a viral video.

06:24.267 --> 06:25.966
The fans want to know
if it's possible

06:25.967 --> 06:27.432
and if they can try it at home.

06:27.433 --> 06:28.566
Check it out.

06:28.567 --> 06:31.332
Narrator:
With a runabout ablaze,

06:31.333 --> 06:35.499
it's jet boat to the rescue,
fighting fire with speed.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.799
Man:
Wow, he's doing it.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.399
This guy's crazy.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.566
But in a crisis,

06:40.567 --> 06:45.666
could an extreme 180
really extinguish a fire?

06:45.667 --> 06:46.966
Dude, that is awesome,

06:46.967 --> 06:48.199
but you know what?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.966
There's something a little fishy
about that video.

06:50.967 --> 06:52.266
It does look like there could be

06:52.267 --> 06:53.899
some kind of visual effects
going on there.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.599
We need to find out
if this thing is repeatable.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.499
Yay, let's go boating.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.832
Motor boating.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.632
You old sailor, you.

07:01.633 --> 07:04.299
Narrator:
So, to find out if this works,

07:04.300 --> 07:05.799
over at big break Marina

07:05.800 --> 07:08.099
they're recreating
all the elements

07:08.100 --> 07:10.266
of this emergency situation.

07:10.267 --> 07:12.166
Tory: So, the boat
we're gonna be using

07:12.167 --> 07:13.566
to put out the fire is this.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.699
It's a 1978 charger jet boat.

07:15.700 --> 07:18.166
It's got
a 350 oldsmobile engine.

07:18.167 --> 07:19.632
[ Horn beeping ]
Come aboard, Matey.

07:19.633 --> 07:22.699
All right, safety first,
my friends. Safety first.

07:22.700 --> 07:27.166
Not only that, but it shoots
a rooster tail up to 120 feet.

07:27.167 --> 07:28.966
We should be able
to put out the fire with this.

07:28.967 --> 07:31.132
I wish we had dorkier
life preservers.

07:31.133 --> 07:32.466
Sorry, man.

07:32.467 --> 07:34.599
These are the dorkiest ones
we could possible find.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.232
What are you talking about?
They match the boat.

07:37.233 --> 07:40.332
They are in this season's
color of safety.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.632
It's hot.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.899
Tory: And the best part is,
they're letting me drive,

07:43.900 --> 07:45.566
except the owner has
one stipulation.

07:45.567 --> 07:47.132
He wants to be
on the boat with us,

07:47.133 --> 07:48.532
which doesn't make any sense

07:48.533 --> 07:50.799
'cause this is probably the most
dangerous place you can be.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.432
I think we need to practice.

07:52.433 --> 07:55.866
See some stunt driving.
Whoo!

07:55.867 --> 07:58.732
Narrator: Precision driving
is key to this myth,

07:58.733 --> 08:03.132
so first Tory needs
to get the boat up to speed,

08:03.133 --> 08:05.632
then just before he crashes
into the pylon,

08:05.633 --> 08:07.400
pull off that 180 turn...

08:09.433 --> 08:15.066
so that the boat sends up
that dousing rooster tail.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.499
That's nice.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.066
That was amazing practice,

08:18.067 --> 08:20.366
but i think it's time
to light a fire.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.432
Let's do it.

08:21.433 --> 08:22.699
Yeah, i think you got it, man.

08:22.700 --> 08:25.499
Narrator: The second element
of this emergency

08:25.500 --> 08:27.066
is the flaming boat,

08:27.067 --> 08:29.566
and for that,
they're taking precautions.

08:29.567 --> 08:31.232
Grant: Oh, hay.

08:31.233 --> 08:35.066
So, this fine water craft
is our fire boat.

08:35.067 --> 08:38.966
We're going to set a bale of hay
and a pallet on fire

08:38.967 --> 08:40.299
and let it burn.

08:40.300 --> 08:41.832
Kari:
You got the air underneath

08:41.833 --> 08:43.432
so that it can light
all of this hay

08:43.433 --> 08:44.599
and actually get a good burn.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.066
This thing should flame up
nicely.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.599
Now, if things go well,

08:47.600 --> 08:50.466
we'll be able to put it out
using the boat.

08:50.467 --> 08:54.366
And if not, the fire department
is on hand to put it out.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.632
Kari: It's time to set the fire,
but before we do that,

08:57.633 --> 09:00.166
we're going to wet down
all of the lands

09:00.167 --> 09:02.499
right behind
where the boat's gonna be.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.966
We don't want any stray embers
to 'cause any unnecessary fire.

09:05.967 --> 09:08.832
Narrator: The boat is now set
to go up just like the video.

09:08.833 --> 09:12.166
Great.
Some vacation, kari.

09:12.167 --> 09:15.899
But will the speed boat's
rooster tail quench the Blaze?

09:15.900 --> 09:17.899
All right, boat's tied.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.899
Tory's all ready to go.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.732
All we got to do
is set the fire now.

09:21.733 --> 09:23.632
Yeah, let's do this.

09:23.633 --> 09:25.232
Tory:
Now, I'm not gonna lie.

09:25.233 --> 09:27.899
I am a little nervous.
I mean, this isn't my boat.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.566
All right,
proceed with lighting the fire.

09:30.567 --> 09:32.966
We're gonna be flying
at 50 miles an hour,

09:32.967 --> 09:34.932
straight towards a flaming boat,

09:34.933 --> 09:37.199
and, at the last minute,
i need to crank on the wheel

09:37.200 --> 09:39.099
so that i don't crash
into the boat,

09:39.100 --> 09:40.832
but spray water onto it.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.866
All right, boys.
We have a raging fire.

09:42.867 --> 09:43.966
Bring it on in.

09:43.967 --> 09:45.432
And not only that,
I'm gonna have Grant

09:45.433 --> 09:47.099
and the owner of the boat
in the boat with me

09:47.100 --> 09:48.966
so if i crash,
I'm not just hurting myself,

09:48.967 --> 09:50.166
I'm hurting two other people.

09:50.167 --> 09:52.099
I'm scared [Bleep]less.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.733
All right, man, there it is.

09:55.967 --> 09:57.699
Just try to understand
what we're doing.

09:57.700 --> 10:00.032
We're heading straight towards
a flaming boat, right?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.899
Exactly.
Okay.

10:01.900 --> 10:04.232
And then, at the last minute,
we're gonna turn out.

10:04.233 --> 10:06.032
I hope this works.

10:06.033 --> 10:08.266

Back me up.

get along like your brothers?

10:17.133 --> 10:21.533
Narrator: More myths
you may be able to try at home.

10:34.233 --> 10:37.766
Narrator: After 10 years
of impossible, dangerous,

10:37.767 --> 10:40.966
and downright crazy myths
that you shouldn't...

10:40.967 --> 10:42.566
Something just touched me!

10:42.567 --> 10:44.632
Narrator:
Or couldn't try at home,

10:44.633 --> 10:49.766
this episode is all about
finding things maybe you can.

10:49.767 --> 10:53.166
So, next, Adam and Jamie
get into a rhythm

10:53.167 --> 10:55.899
with one, two, five...

10:55.900 --> 10:58.666
216 metronomes.

10:58.667 --> 11:02.432
Adam: [ Laughing ]

11:02.433 --> 11:03.899
Keep going, keep going.

11:03.900 --> 11:07.833
Well, that escalated quickly,
but how did they end up here?

11:12.967 --> 11:15.166
There are a bunch of videos
out there

11:15.167 --> 11:18.099
that show these things
getting into sync

11:18.100 --> 11:20.332
if you let them run for a while.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.732
Come on, guys. Get with it.

11:22.733 --> 11:25.499
Narrator:
It all looks so easy online.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.066
Although they start out
syncopated,

11:28.067 --> 11:30.766
these metronomes
eventually tick over

11:30.767 --> 11:32.766
into a synchronized symphony.

11:32.767 --> 11:34.632
[ Ticking ]

11:34.633 --> 11:38.732
But can you make metronomes
dance to the same beat at home?

11:38.733 --> 11:40.166
[ Ticking ]

11:40.167 --> 11:41.932
There is one thing
that i keep noticing

11:41.933 --> 11:44.066
in all the videos
of the metronomes syncing up,

11:44.067 --> 11:46.499
and it is that they always seem
to be sitting on a platform

11:46.500 --> 11:50.066
that moves slightly, that's got
a little shake or shimmy to it.

11:50.067 --> 11:52.832
Let me show you
why i think that's important.

11:52.833 --> 11:55.733
If i move this metronome
while it's ticking...

11:59.067 --> 12:02.099
even small movements
have a significant effect

12:02.100 --> 12:04.299
on the periodicity
of its ticking.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.632
I've got a couple of soda cans.

12:06.633 --> 12:09.066
This is my platform with shimmy.

12:09.067 --> 12:11.166
Got a metronome, and i just want
to see what happens

12:11.167 --> 12:14.299
when i put one on here.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.666
Do you see it?

12:17.667 --> 12:20.066
It's totally moving.

12:20.067 --> 12:21.432
This is very cool.

12:21.433 --> 12:23.066
This little metronome
is definitely having

12:23.067 --> 12:25.066
an appreciable effect
on my platform,

12:25.067 --> 12:27.299
and i think it'll have
even more of an effect

12:27.300 --> 12:28.632
if the platform's lighter.

12:28.633 --> 12:30.066
And I've got just the thing.

12:30.067 --> 12:31.732
All right,
this is working great.

12:31.733 --> 12:34.232
It's definitely having
more of an appreciable effect.

12:34.233 --> 12:36.432
Just got a nice
bearing surface platform,

12:36.433 --> 12:37.799
light aluminum pipes,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.599
and a very light platform
for it to sit on.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.566
I'm taking away as much friction
and momentum as i can

12:42.567 --> 12:45.266
so that only the metronome
is having the effect.

12:45.267 --> 12:46.399
Now, let's try two.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.766
Narrator:
Adam doubles his trouble

12:48.767 --> 12:50.966
with two metronomes
set to the same tick mark.

12:50.967 --> 12:54.732
Look at the movement
on this platform.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.966
Narrator: And after two minutes,
the shimmy takes over.

12:57.967 --> 13:00.699
Adam: Stay with it, boys.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.632
Nice.

13:02.633 --> 13:05.699
Nice. It's totally working.

13:05.700 --> 13:09.932
It just took them a little while
to find each other's rhythm.

13:09.933 --> 13:14.166
Narrator: So, if two will sync,
will five march to the beat?

13:14.167 --> 13:18.066
This pink one is messing
with my mellow here.

13:18.067 --> 13:21.566
Narrator: Well, three minutes in
and something has come unsunk.

13:21.567 --> 13:24.299
This pink one is way out
of phase with the other four.

13:24.300 --> 13:27.366
The other four seem to want to
get into phase with each other,

13:27.367 --> 13:30.432
but the pink one's
not playing along nicely.

13:30.433 --> 13:33.399
[ Italian accent ] Why can't you
get along like your brothers?

13:33.400 --> 13:35.533
[ Normal voice ] All right,
here we go. Let's try.

13:37.467 --> 13:40.299
Narrator: Amazingly,
it seems that Adam

13:40.300 --> 13:42.766
has tickled the pink
just the right amount.

13:42.767 --> 13:45.099
There it is. Okay.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.966
[ Laughs ]

13:47.967 --> 13:50.066
We got it working.

13:50.067 --> 13:52.067
[ Ticking ]

13:53.067 --> 13:54.499
Yep, they're in sync.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.599
That's awesome.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.766
Okay. Everyone be quiet,
everyone be quiet.

13:58.767 --> 14:00.432
Stop, stop, stop.

14:00.433 --> 14:03.099
All right. Let me explain
what happened here.

14:03.100 --> 14:06.066
This pink one was not
playing well with the others,

14:06.067 --> 14:08.066
and i noticed
when i was watching it

14:08.067 --> 14:10.666
that it was just consistently
a little too slow.

14:10.667 --> 14:13.732
So, on the theory that
the manufacturing tolerances

14:13.733 --> 14:15.532
on these metronomes are loose,

14:15.533 --> 14:19.066
i sped it up by dropping it
a tiny amount

14:19.067 --> 14:21.299
below its lowest tick mark,

14:21.300 --> 14:22.966
which is what all the others
are set at.

14:22.967 --> 14:25.632
And that turned out to be
the magic bullet

14:25.633 --> 14:27.799
that helped this all
get in sync.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.066
It's awesome to know.

14:29.067 --> 14:30.366
These are tunable.

14:30.367 --> 14:33.799
Narrator: And now that he's got
his tickers tweaked,

14:33.800 --> 14:36.899
just how many can he make dance
to his tune?

14:36.900 --> 14:38.232
Got it.

14:38.233 --> 14:41.232
I can't fit any more on here.

14:41.233 --> 14:45.766
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

14:45.767 --> 14:50.566
Dude, it's really
kind of amazing.

14:50.567 --> 14:55.632
They go way out of sync,
then they come back into sync,

14:55.633 --> 14:57.499
and eventually they find this.

14:57.500 --> 15:01.499
And if one of them's out...

15:01.500 --> 15:04.066
They kind of get him
back in line.

15:04.067 --> 15:05.432
They all just want
to be friends.

15:05.433 --> 15:06.766
They all want to be friends,

15:06.767 --> 15:08.532
they all want to do
the same thing.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.366
Adam's taken this to 11.

15:11.367 --> 15:14.566

about to start.

Straight for the pylon.

Tory's rooster tail certainly
seems to have doused the boat,

15:46.567 --> 15:50.632
but there's no smoke
without fire so the guys reset.

15:50.633 --> 15:53.132
Reset so we can do it again
with one more pass,

15:53.133 --> 15:54.399
just to make sure it's out.

I think it's looking good,
though.

I think it went out
with the first pass.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.066
The second pass is insurance.

I think the third time's
just for fun.

Wow, they got so close
to the boat this time.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.132
That was amazing.

16:32.133 --> 16:34.232
Narrator: But now that they know
this firefighting feat

16:34.233 --> 16:38.566
is no myth, the question is,
should you try this at home?

16:39.900 --> 16:41.732
Going at full throttle,
50 miles an hour,

16:41.733 --> 16:44.067
straight towards a flaming boat.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.699
And then, right before i hit it,
i had to crank the wheel

16:48.700 --> 16:52.832
to spray the water
onto the flaming boat.

I don't think
I'd try this at home.

Yes, we were able
to pull this off

professional firefighters,

professional boat drivers.

17:12.233 --> 17:14.066
But here's the thing.

17:14.067 --> 17:17.499
In order to do this,
you need to overcome your fear

17:17.500 --> 17:20.299
of driving directly
at a flaming boat,

17:20.300 --> 17:22.866
and be able to turn
at the last second.

17:22.867 --> 17:26.166
Not to mention,
you need a jet boat.

this is not something
that just anybody can do.

Yep, it's always best

17:32.433 --> 17:35.166
to leave the firefighting
to the professionals.

borrow his boat again.

17:39.167 --> 17:40.400
[ Clicks tongue ]

17:44.433 --> 17:46.199
Adam:
Well, the myth that metronomes,

17:46.200 --> 17:48.666
if placed on a proper surface
and activated together,

17:48.667 --> 17:50.399
will eventually
sync themselves up

17:50.400 --> 17:52.399
seems to be
on pretty solid footing.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.199
Got it to work with a couple,
got it to work with a handful,

17:55.200 --> 17:57.167
but now it's time
to go for broke.

17:59.867 --> 18:03.166
In front of me here
is an air hockey table,

18:03.167 --> 18:07.699
and Jamie has set out,
carefully, 216 metronomes.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.499
This is more
than we have ever seen

in any of the videos
demonstrating this phenomenon.

In a few minutes, we are hoping

18:13.900 --> 18:16.732
that we'll be setting
an unofficial world's record.

18:16.733 --> 18:18.766
Why are we using
an air hockey table?

18:18.767 --> 18:20.699
Air hockey is a game
in which the puck floats

18:20.700 --> 18:21.766
on a cushion of air.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.066
It's definitely floating.

18:24.067 --> 18:27.066
And now our metronomes
will float on a cushion of air.

18:27.067 --> 18:29.899
That should allow them
the low friction environment

18:29.900 --> 18:33.266
that makes them shimmy their way
to synchronization.

18:33.267 --> 18:35.399

at that corner,

at the same tempo,

they should start that shimmy.

hypnotized by the sound.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.366
I know.

19:09.367 --> 19:11.766
But with 216 metronomes,

19:11.767 --> 19:14.366
almost 20 times the amount
of their last attempt,

19:14.367 --> 19:18.066
can they break a world record,

19:18.067 --> 19:21.767
or will the metronomes
march to a different tune?

19:30.800 --> 19:33.366
Narrator: It's the "do try this
at home?" Special,

19:33.367 --> 19:35.199
and next up, Adam and Jamie
are investigating

19:35.200 --> 19:37.599
the old ball chain.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.932
We all know what this stuff
is... regular chrome ball chain.

19:40.933 --> 19:42.266
Keys, ids, and dog tags

19:42.267 --> 19:44.266
have been hanging from it
for decades,

19:44.267 --> 19:46.399
but we've got a viral video

19:46.400 --> 19:49.066
that seems to show this stuff,
under the right conditions,

19:49.067 --> 19:53.199
behaving almost against
the force of gravity.

19:53.200 --> 19:57.066
Narrator: So, supposedly,
this gravity defying feat

19:57.067 --> 20:00.166
is achieved without any
special effects wizardry,

20:00.167 --> 20:02.199
but are they yanking your chain,

20:02.200 --> 20:05.832
or could you really recreate it
with just a ball chain,

20:05.833 --> 20:09.266
a beaker, and, if you have one,
a high speed camera?

20:09.267 --> 20:11.433
Check this out.

20:18.733 --> 20:20.799
Let's check out the high speed.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.499
Hey, Adam.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.132
No.

20:24.133 --> 20:25.566
It's like it's going all the way
across the room.

20:25.567 --> 20:27.999
Wow.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.866
It doesn't look like it should
be able to do that, does it?

20:30.867 --> 20:32.066
No.

20:32.067 --> 20:33.599
It's like magic.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.999
That is freakin' gorgeous.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.999
That is so freakin' cool.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.799
Narrator:
Cool and surprising,

20:41.800 --> 20:44.199
as the ball chain seems
to levitate out

20:44.200 --> 20:45.866
and over the lip of the cup,

20:45.867 --> 20:50.466
and this strange behavior
has gotten Jamie thinking.

20:50.467 --> 20:51.899
Jamie: Now, we've got
some bigger chain.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.633
Let's see if it goes further.

21:04.367 --> 21:06.466
Narrator: It does seem
the bigger the ball,

21:06.467 --> 21:07.866
the greater the effect,

21:07.867 --> 21:09.532
but is this gravity defying act

21:09.533 --> 21:12.899
also related to the distance
you are from the ground?

21:12.900 --> 21:17.100
Okay, let's see what this does
from eight feet up.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.532
That made a difference.

21:25.533 --> 21:27.066
It's clear from our testing

21:27.067 --> 21:29.899
that there are two key forces
that are causing this effect.

21:29.900 --> 21:32.866
And the first is that mass
moving in a particular direction

21:32.867 --> 21:35.132
wants to continue moving
in that direction,

21:35.133 --> 21:38.132
so when we're yanking the chain
up out of the pot,

21:38.133 --> 21:40.566
it wants to continue
moving upward,

21:40.567 --> 21:43.799
but shortly after, gravity
starts to pull it down,

21:43.800 --> 21:46.266
and so that's where we get
this arc.

21:46.267 --> 21:48.799
If one of these forces
is out of balance,

21:48.800 --> 21:52.066
like, as in if gravity starts
to pull down too hard,

21:52.067 --> 21:54.466
then we don't get
as large of an arc.

21:54.467 --> 21:57.232
But when these two forces
are perfectly balanced,

21:57.233 --> 21:59.832
coupled with the unique
symmetrical and slick

21:59.833 --> 22:02.166
design of this chain,
it all converges

22:02.167 --> 22:05.332
to create an arc that seems like
it should be impossible.

22:05.333 --> 22:09.067
But whatever the explanation,
it's a really cool effect.

22:10.100 --> 22:13.432
Narrator: It's cool,
and to take it to the Max,

22:13.433 --> 22:16.332
Adam's got this one
all chained up.

22:16.333 --> 22:18.299
Wow.

22:18.300 --> 22:20.732
The biggest ball chain
i could possibly buy.

22:20.733 --> 22:22.132
Whenever you're ready.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.067
Here we go.

22:25.933 --> 22:29.199
[ Laughs ] Wow!

22:29.200 --> 22:30.599
That was amazing.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.466
That worked really well.

22:32.467 --> 22:35.966
Adam: It's almost magical
watching the chain flow,

22:35.967 --> 22:39.066
seemingly defying gravity,
out of the cup.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.666
My favorite part about it,
though,

22:40.667 --> 22:42.399
is that is seems to be
proportional

22:42.400 --> 22:43.766
to the size of the ball chain,

22:43.767 --> 22:46.132
so you get a little loop
with stuff like this,

22:46.133 --> 22:48.732
and you get a nice giant loop
with stuff like this.

22:48.733 --> 22:51.332
I didn't even know they made
stuff this big until this story.

22:51.333 --> 22:52.666
This is awesome.

22:52.667 --> 22:58.100
Narrator: Yep, this chain
reaction is surprisingly diy.

23:03.333 --> 23:06.799
So, break out the beakers
and the ball chain,

23:06.800 --> 23:10.900
and make sure
that you do try this at home.

23:14.300 --> 23:18.299
Next, the team
is on a chemistry safari.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.266
All right,
these next chemical experiments,

23:20.267 --> 23:22.299
fans want us to test,
one, if they're genuine

23:22.300 --> 23:24.232
and two, if it's something
that they can try at home.

23:24.233 --> 23:25.332
What are they?

23:25.333 --> 23:28.366
Elephant toothpaste
and exploding snakes.

23:28.367 --> 23:29.699
Elephants and exploding things?

23:29.700 --> 23:31.099
Are we sure
that this is something

23:31.100 --> 23:32.299
that people can do at home?

23:32.300 --> 23:34.199
Narrator:
Well, with an ingredients list

23:34.200 --> 23:36.532
made up of household items,

23:36.533 --> 23:40.966
elephant toothpaste is the first
diy science to try.

23:40.967 --> 23:43.299
All you need's
a little hydrogen peroxide,

23:43.300 --> 23:45.099
the kind you would get
for dying your hair,

23:45.100 --> 23:47.432
liquid dish soap,

23:47.433 --> 23:49.466
little food coloring
for pizzazz.

23:49.467 --> 23:51.066
Ooh.

23:51.067 --> 23:54.799
And, finally, the catalyst,
which is plain old yeast.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.432
Are you about to blow our minds?

23:56.433 --> 23:59.232
I am.
Stand back.

23:59.233 --> 24:00.532
Whoa.

24:00.533 --> 24:02.366
Whoa.

24:02.367 --> 24:04.599
It's like a volcano
from science fair.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.266
Look at that.
It's minty fresh.

24:06.267 --> 24:09.566
Narrator: It's easy to see
why this super-sized foam

24:09.567 --> 24:11.466
is called elephant toothpaste.

24:11.467 --> 24:14.066
Now, in its basic form, hydrogen
peroxide is extremely stable,

24:14.067 --> 24:17.332
but what's happening here
is when you add the yeast,

24:17.333 --> 24:20.666
it's decomposing the hydrogen
peroxide very rapidly,

24:20.667 --> 24:22.099
and releasing oxygen.

24:22.100 --> 24:24.966
The oxygen is getting captured
inside the liquid dish soap,

24:24.967 --> 24:26.566
which is creating bubbles

24:26.567 --> 24:28.899
and this big, foamy,
awesome mess.

24:28.900 --> 24:32.366
Narrator: And although it passes
the try this at home test,

24:32.367 --> 24:34.066
it's just a frothy fountain.

24:34.067 --> 24:38.232
So how about an only on
"mythbusters" twist?

24:38.233 --> 24:40.332
Don't try this at home.

24:40.333 --> 24:42.066
[ Siren wailing ]

24:42.067 --> 24:44.066
All right,
to take this experiment

24:44.067 --> 24:47.066
from "go ahead, try it at home"
to "mythbusters" danger,

24:47.067 --> 24:49.699
we're gonna use some lab grade
components here.

24:49.700 --> 24:52.566
We have a higher concentration
of hydrogen peroxide,

24:52.567 --> 24:54.799
and for our catalyst,
potassium iodide.

24:54.800 --> 24:58.466
Now, these are much more caustic
chemicals here,

24:58.467 --> 25:01.767
and the reaction
is a lot more energetic.

25:03.333 --> 25:05.432
Narrator: Okay, so take two,

25:05.433 --> 25:09.699
but this is definitely
a do not try at home.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.766
One step back.
Is it gonna get crazy?

25:11.767 --> 25:14.132
Yeah? You about to drop
some science on us?

25:14.133 --> 25:16.132
You ready?
Do it.

25:16.133 --> 25:17.932
Whoa.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.632
Holy crap.

25:20.633 --> 25:22.732
What the heck?

25:22.733 --> 25:25.432
Much more energetic experiment.

25:25.433 --> 25:26.566
Look how hot it is.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.566
You can see the steam
coming off.

25:28.567 --> 25:30.666
Narrator: Yep,
that's the kind of toothpaste

25:30.667 --> 25:32.466
an elephant would be proud of.

25:32.467 --> 25:33.899
Kari: There you have it.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.399
Two versions
of elephant toothpaste.

25:36.400 --> 25:39.666
The first, definitely a try it
at home experiment.

25:39.667 --> 25:42.866
It's just household items
like peroxide and yeast

25:42.867 --> 25:45.966
give you this beautiful fountain
of magical foam.

25:45.967 --> 25:48.266
The second,
a little more dangerous.

25:48.267 --> 25:50.932
We're talking about
lab grade ingredients,

25:50.933 --> 25:54.266
creating an exothermic reaction
with a lot more oxygen,

25:54.267 --> 25:57.332
a lot more heat, and a much more
spectacular mess.

25:57.333 --> 25:59.166
Definitely worth the clean up.

25:59.167 --> 26:00.699
But i still don't understand

26:00.700 --> 26:02.732
why they call it
elephant toothpaste.

26:02.733 --> 26:05.266
I wasn't aware that elephants
brush their teeth.

26:05.267 --> 26:08.432
Narrator: But now we've seen
the toothpaste,

26:08.433 --> 26:11.466
didn't someone mention
an exploding snake?

26:11.467 --> 26:13.566
Grant: Now, for the most part,
elephant toothpaste

26:13.567 --> 26:15.466
is the sort of experiment
you can do at home.

26:15.467 --> 26:18.099
This next one
is a little bit different.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.933
It's called explosive snake.

26:21.133 --> 26:23.632
Now, the first part of it
involves sugar,

26:23.633 --> 26:25.466
which, by itself, is innocuous.

26:25.467 --> 26:28.466
The part that makes it different
is the other half,

26:28.467 --> 26:31.866
which is this... sulfuric acid.

26:31.867 --> 26:34.332
Tory:
Look at that. Wow!

26:34.333 --> 26:36.466
Sulfuric acid is corrosive.

26:36.467 --> 26:39.066
It's caustic, and if you
splash it on your skin,

26:39.067 --> 26:40.866
you could get severe burns

26:40.867 --> 26:43.699
so, unfortunately,
not the sort of thing

26:43.700 --> 26:45.399
you want to try at home.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.966
And to do this experiment,

26:46.967 --> 26:50.167
i think I'm gonna need
a slightly different wardrobe.

26:54.933 --> 26:57.066
Ah, that's better.

26:57.067 --> 26:59.632
So, I've got an apron
to protect my clothing.

26:59.633 --> 27:01.866
Acid gloves
should protect my hands,

27:01.867 --> 27:04.932
and a face shield for my face.

27:04.933 --> 27:08.332
Now it's time
to mix up the elements.

27:08.333 --> 27:10.666
Narrator: It's another
do not try this at home,

27:10.667 --> 27:13.067
but will it be explosive?

27:15.533 --> 27:17.866
Grant:
Okay, so it's coming.

27:17.867 --> 27:20.299
Narrator: Eh, actually, no.

27:20.300 --> 27:22.166
[ Coughing ]

27:22.167 --> 27:23.666
Okay, so what happened here?

27:23.667 --> 27:25.832
Well, the acid interacts
with the sugar

27:25.833 --> 27:28.066
and breaks it down
into its components,

27:28.067 --> 27:30.066
releases water
in the form of steam,

27:30.067 --> 27:33.366
and it leaves behind carbon,
which is what the snake is.

27:33.367 --> 27:35.366
Now, it's a very cool reaction,

27:35.367 --> 27:38.066
but not necessarily
all that explosive.

27:38.067 --> 27:39.399
I think in order to be
explosive,

27:39.400 --> 27:42.699
it should be faster
and more violent,

27:42.700 --> 27:46.066
and i think i can find
a reaction that does that.

27:46.067 --> 27:48.699
Narrator: So lab raider imahara
swaps out the sugar

27:48.700 --> 27:52.066
for a classified
organic compound,

27:52.067 --> 27:54.066
adds the sulfuric acid,

27:54.067 --> 27:56.466
then brings a little heat
to the equation.

27:56.467 --> 27:59.866
But will this result
in that explosive snake?

27:59.867 --> 28:02.599
Grant: Watch it.

28:02.600 --> 28:07.266
Okay, don't blink 'cause this
can happen really fast.

28:07.267 --> 28:08.967
Okay. This is it.

28:11.067 --> 28:14.832
No way!
That's amazing.

28:14.833 --> 28:17.732
Narrator: It's an instantaneous
process called de-ammonization.

28:17.733 --> 28:21.332
[ Coughing ]

28:21.333 --> 28:24.332
Narrator: The sulfuric acid
dehydrated the compound,

28:24.333 --> 28:27.332
leaving in its wake
a flaky carbon snake.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.532
Grant: So, conclusion...

28:29.533 --> 28:32.799
Two explosive snakes
by different means,

28:32.800 --> 28:35.632
but unfortunately
because of the sulfuric acid,

28:35.633 --> 28:37.966
you can't try either of them
at home.

28:37.967 --> 28:40.266
Narrator: So while both myths
are confirmed,

28:40.267 --> 28:42.332
unless you've got access
to a lab tech

28:42.333 --> 28:44.666
and lab grade materials,

28:44.667 --> 28:47.800
you can't try these at home.

28:51.267 --> 28:55.367
Meanwhile,
back at metronome hq...

28:57.867 --> 29:00.666
Adam: Every now and
then, it sounds like
they're getting together.

29:00.667 --> 29:02.066
Yeah.

29:02.067 --> 29:04.699
I do think that they cross
phases somehow,

29:04.700 --> 29:07.066
but i think they may be
in sequence,

29:07.067 --> 29:08.799
but not in the correct position.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.166
If you look down the line,

29:10.167 --> 29:12.732
there's no rhythm or reason
to this.

29:12.733 --> 29:16.567
It's a case of so far,
not so good.

29:23.633 --> 29:25.099
What you're about to see
could be dangerous.

29:25.100 --> 29:26.399
We're trained professionals

29:26.400 --> 29:28.433
so, please,
leave the myth busting to us.

29:32.167 --> 29:34.366
Welcome to "mythbusters".

29:34.367 --> 29:37.066
On today's episode, we're doing
things that you can try at home.

29:37.067 --> 29:38.332
I'm gonna show you a few things

29:38.333 --> 29:39.899
that you should never try
at home.

29:39.900 --> 29:41.432
Swimming with sharks.

29:41.433 --> 29:43.399
Kari: Oh, my god.
Don't do that.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.066
Getting in the ring with a bull.

29:45.067 --> 29:46.432
Don't do that.

29:46.433 --> 29:48.600
Don't ride a rocket-powered
surf board.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.299
Don't get chased by crocodiles.

29:52.300 --> 29:55.067
And definitely don't try to jump
over a wagon on a bike.

29:56.433 --> 29:58.632
Who would be crazy enough
to do all those things?

29:58.633 --> 29:59.832
Narrator: Who, indeed.

29:59.833 --> 30:04.399
And next, could this soda stunt
do you harm?

30:04.400 --> 30:05.532
Next up is a story

30:05.533 --> 30:07.366
that should definitely never
be tried at home

30:07.367 --> 30:08.999
or anywhere else
for that matter,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.099
given that it's illegal
in a bunch of states.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.166
What's that?

30:12.167 --> 30:13.499
Dry-ice bombs.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.899
Yep, well, exploding things
is never a good idea to try,

30:16.900 --> 30:19.466
so why is it we're tackling it
on this show?

30:19.467 --> 30:22.432
Because like it or not,
people do try this at home.

30:22.433 --> 30:24.832
These things put out
a tremendous bang.

30:24.833 --> 30:26.566
I think they also put out
a tremendous bite.

30:26.567 --> 30:28.032
That's what we want to look at.

30:28.033 --> 30:29.899
So we want to find out just how
dangerous they really are?

30:29.900 --> 30:30.900
Exactly.

30:30.901 --> 30:32.766
We're gonna look precisely
at why

30:32.767 --> 30:35.432
you should not try
dry-ice bombs at home.

30:35.433 --> 30:37.432
Narrator: This diy device

30:37.433 --> 30:40.332
works on that old trapped
pressure principle,

30:40.333 --> 30:44.632
which the myth busters know can
be both spectacular and lethal.

30:44.633 --> 30:46.099
Oh!

30:46.100 --> 30:52.699
But just how lethal will these
dry-ice bombs turn out to be?

30:52.700 --> 30:56.132
To find out,
Adam's got to set his cap first.

30:56.133 --> 30:59.099
The capping it and getting away
is where the real danger is.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.899
I've seen these things go off
as quickly as a few seconds,

31:01.900 --> 31:04.266
so i don't want to be
anywhere near these things

31:04.267 --> 31:06.699
when we're trying to film them
on high speed camera

31:06.700 --> 31:07.933
and assess their damage.

31:10.133 --> 31:11.699
That might work.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.566
Now, we're gonna be conducting
this test with bottles

31:13.567 --> 31:15.166
as different as this one
and this one,

31:15.167 --> 31:17.366
but i need to put the caps
on all of them,

31:17.367 --> 31:19.566
and my method is gonna be
using this thing

31:19.567 --> 31:22.766
because it has a handy
turning part out the front.

31:22.767 --> 31:23.967
[ Drill whirs ]

31:28.567 --> 31:31.499
[ Laughs ]

31:31.500 --> 31:33.799
That's how we're gonna do it.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.499
Narrator: Adam sorted
the hands-free capping.

31:36.500 --> 31:39.499
Put your forearm into that hole.

31:39.500 --> 31:43.499
But now Jamie needs to give
this dry-ice combo a hand.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.166
Jamie: We want to find out
exactly how dangerous

31:46.167 --> 31:48.899
this is to somebody
that might be holding onto it.

31:48.900 --> 31:51.466
Obviously, we're not gonna use
our own hands for that,

31:51.467 --> 31:54.099
so we're gonna need
some artificial hands.

31:54.100 --> 31:55.799
Beauty.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.566
That came out perfect.

31:57.567 --> 32:00.632
So we've got our complete set
of hand molds now.

32:00.633 --> 32:04.532
All we have to do
is put these skeletons in them

32:04.533 --> 32:06.932
and then put the tops on them,
strap them together,

32:06.933 --> 32:08.899
fill them with rubber,
and we're good to go.

32:08.900 --> 32:13.232
Since we're anticipating
a little bit of physical damage

32:13.233 --> 32:15.699
to the hand, we might as well
make it look good.

32:15.700 --> 32:17.566
Oh, yeah.

32:17.567 --> 32:20.499
Oh, it's so pretty.

32:20.500 --> 32:22.699
Nice. It's gonna be perfect
for the test.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.332
Yeah.

32:24.333 --> 32:29.832
Narrator:
So, now they can get hands on
with their dry-ice device.

32:29.833 --> 32:32.832
I'm not running
for my own recreation.

32:32.833 --> 32:34.299
Who would do that?

32:34.300 --> 32:37.266
No, I'm running
because this is our location

32:37.267 --> 32:39.632
for detonating
the dry-ice bombs.

32:39.633 --> 32:40.699
That's right.

32:40.700 --> 32:42.366
We've come to the bomb range

32:42.367 --> 32:44.066
because that's how seriously

32:44.067 --> 32:46.232
we take the danger
of these things.

32:46.233 --> 32:47.566
Narrator: It's serious,

32:47.567 --> 32:49.199
because although soda bottles
are designed

32:49.200 --> 32:53.066
to resist the pressure
of their carbonized contents,

32:53.067 --> 32:56.566
expanding dry ice
is a whole 'nother ball game.

32:56.567 --> 32:57.732
Perfect.

32:57.733 --> 32:59.199
So what are we doing?

32:59.200 --> 33:01.666
Well,
we're putting frozen co2...

33:01.667 --> 33:05.366
Yep, this stuff,
known commonly as dry ice.

33:05.367 --> 33:06.832
Inside a sealed container

33:06.833 --> 33:08.699
along with a little bit
of water.

33:08.700 --> 33:12.099
The water converts
the frozen co2 to gaseous co2,

33:12.100 --> 33:16.632
expanding to between 500 and 800
times its original volume.

33:16.633 --> 33:18.699
Which'll increase the pressure
inside the container

33:18.700 --> 33:21.166
to in excess of 100 psi,

33:21.167 --> 33:23.832
at which point
it'll rupture violently,

33:23.833 --> 33:25.299
releasing all of that gas,

33:25.300 --> 33:28.266
not unlike what happens
when you set off an explosive.

33:28.267 --> 33:29.966
Boom.

33:29.967 --> 33:31.799
Narrator:
Yep, so now it's time

33:31.800 --> 33:33.832
to bring some data
to the equation

33:33.833 --> 33:37.400
and find out just how damaging
those booms can be.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.066
Back at the shop...

33:49.067 --> 33:50.699
What is your problem?

33:50.700 --> 33:52.632
Things are starting
to wind down.

33:52.633 --> 33:55.899
Ah! [ Laughs ]

33:55.900 --> 33:57.732
Keep going, keep going.

33:57.733 --> 34:00.166
So Adam and Jamie
are winding them up again.

34:00.167 --> 34:01.899
Remember, kids, this is
something you can do

34:01.900 --> 34:05.766
with that extra 200 metronomes
you've got around the house.

34:05.767 --> 34:09.832
After 30 minutes of ticking,
Adam tries a last ditch attempt

34:09.833 --> 34:11.666
to nudge the metronomes
into sync.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.232
[ Ticking ]

34:13.233 --> 34:15.632
Oh, look at that.

34:15.633 --> 34:19.299
But as soon as he stops,
they come out of phase.

34:19.300 --> 34:21.499
They're starting to run out.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.699
Ohh!

34:22.700 --> 34:24.432
[ Laughs ]

34:24.433 --> 34:27.133
And it's clear this game is up.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.366
Adam: Jamie and i started them
one at a time.

34:31.367 --> 34:34.066
We were able to get them all
going in a couple of minutes,

34:34.067 --> 34:36.066
but they never quite
got synched up.

34:36.067 --> 34:38.632
You could hear them going
in phase and out of phase.

34:38.633 --> 34:40.432
That one's out, that one's out.

34:40.433 --> 34:42.132
And certainly looking
down the aisles

34:42.133 --> 34:43.299
and through the columns,

34:43.300 --> 34:46.432
they looked awesome
and they sounded amazing,

34:46.433 --> 34:49.232
but they never quite got
all in sync together.

34:49.233 --> 34:51.766
I love the sound,

34:51.767 --> 34:54.699
but this is not a successful
world record attempt.

34:54.700 --> 34:56.766
Every now and then,
you could hear them sort of...

34:56.767 --> 34:58.566
It sounded like they were
marching in step,

34:58.567 --> 35:01.599
and then they'd march
right back out of step again.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.332
This just totally didn't work.

35:03.333 --> 35:06.966
Narrator: Despite the high tech,
low friction air hockey table,

35:06.967 --> 35:09.632
the metronomes just didn't want
to synchronize.

35:09.633 --> 35:10.932
Adam: So, clearly,

35:10.933 --> 35:13.399
while these metronomes
work fine individually,

35:13.400 --> 35:16.166
there is enough variation
in the manufacturing tolerance

35:16.167 --> 35:18.966
that to get them all ticking
in perfect sync,

35:18.967 --> 35:21.966
you would have to calibrate
each one individually.

35:21.967 --> 35:25.066
Now, if you want to cross
calibrate 216 metronomes,

35:25.067 --> 35:27.499
by all means go ahead
and give it a try.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.632

35:28.633 --> 35:30.632

35:33.233 --> 35:36.732
This is the biggest fail
we have ever achieved.

35:36.733 --> 35:37.799
All that work.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.066
Yeah, you can try this at home.

Your results may vary.

35:42.233 --> 35:44.267
See you next time.

35:56.733 --> 35:58.066
Now, we found this one
on the Internet.

35:58.067 --> 36:01.166
A man made a video
of water coming out of a hose,

36:01.167 --> 36:03.632
and he made the water
freeze in space.

36:03.633 --> 36:05.066
I did exactly
what he said to do.

36:05.067 --> 36:06.132
I got a speaker.

36:06.133 --> 36:08.166
I taped a hose
with running water to it,

36:08.167 --> 36:10.132
and then i attached it
to a tone generator.

36:10.133 --> 36:12.232
Now, there's one last piece
to this puzzle,

36:12.233 --> 36:13.599
and that's a video camera.

Whoa! [ Laughs ]

36:19.067 --> 36:21.266
Now, watch this.
I can make it go backwards.

36:21.267 --> 36:23.532
I'm gonna take it to 22 hertz.

36:23.533 --> 36:25.199
It goes backwards.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.599
What?
What?

36:26.600 --> 36:29.332
Now, the whole reason
this optical illusion works

36:29.333 --> 36:31.632
is 'cause you are shooting
24 frames per second.

36:31.633 --> 36:35.199
If you set the hertz around 24,
it vibrates the water

36:35.200 --> 36:36.866
so that the water's
in the same place

36:36.867 --> 36:38.799
every single time
the camera takes a picture,

36:38.800 --> 36:41.666
which makes it look like
the water is frozen in space.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.366
And if you play around
with the hertz,

36:43.367 --> 36:44.732
you can actually make it look

36:44.733 --> 36:46.499
like the water
is going in reverse.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.066
It's not really,
but it looks like it.

very high, but it did,

40:01.333 --> 40:03.199
No way.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.966
That's steel,

40:04.967 --> 40:07.099
and it's steel
with an angle on it

40:07.100 --> 40:09.199
so imagine what that'd do
to your hand.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.766
I mean, that's got to hurt.

40:10.767 --> 40:12.632
And that was just
a little bottle.

40:12.633 --> 40:14.232
Let's try the big one.
Okay.

40:14.233 --> 40:16.299
Narrator:
So the 350 mil explosion

40:16.300 --> 40:18.566
was steel bendingly strong,

40:18.567 --> 40:21.832
but as the two liter bottle
distends and elongates

40:21.833 --> 40:23.266
with the expansion of the gases,

40:23.267 --> 40:26.132
will it prove
even more dangerous?

40:26.133 --> 40:28.466
Jamie: It's changing shape
at the bottom.

40:28.467 --> 40:29.566
Adam: Look at that.

40:29.567 --> 40:30.832
It's gonna be a good one.

40:30.833 --> 40:32.000
Wow!

40:33.900 --> 40:35.966
Getting longer.
Oh!

40:35.967 --> 40:37.199
Oh!

40:37.200 --> 40:39.566
That was good.
That was intense.

40:39.567 --> 40:44.166
Intense, just like the data
from the pcb sensors.

40:44.167 --> 40:47.599
Jamie: The sensor results from
the big bottle going off are in

40:47.600 --> 40:49.966
and they're more than double
what the little bottle put out.

40:49.967 --> 40:51.699
They were seven psi.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.832
Now, that's enough to cause
permanent hearing damage.

40:54.833 --> 40:57.699
As to what other kind
of injury it could cause,

40:57.700 --> 41:00.599
the sensors may not be
telling the full story.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.066
Show of hands,
who wants to ramp it up?

41:03.067 --> 41:06.632
Narrator: The numbers alone
say you should never try this,

41:06.633 --> 41:08.366
but there's still
the damage test to go.

41:08.367 --> 41:09.899
Adam:
Yeah, i got a prediction.

41:09.900 --> 41:11.666
I don't think the explosion
we're gonna see

41:11.667 --> 41:13.632
is gonna be as big
as this crater that Jamie made

41:13.633 --> 41:15.266
when he arrived at work
this morning...

41:15.267 --> 41:17.066
You happy?
Yeah.

41:17.067 --> 41:18.232
Let's do it.

41:18.233 --> 41:19.832
But i do think
that after watching

41:19.833 --> 41:22.066
what it does to the hands
on either side of the bottle,

41:22.067 --> 41:23.866
you're not gonna want
to try this at home.

41:23.867 --> 41:26.899
Frankly, I've always wanted to
do this particular experiment.

41:26.900 --> 41:29.099
Narrator: From the start,

41:29.100 --> 41:32.832
the expansion of the co2
pushes the hands apart.

41:32.833 --> 41:34.766
It's moving.

41:34.767 --> 41:37.167
It won't be long now.

41:38.100 --> 41:39.799
Oh!

41:39.800 --> 41:41.499
[ Laughs ]

41:41.500 --> 41:43.466
That was loud.
Yeah.

41:43.467 --> 41:46.566
That violent rupture
sent the arms akimbo,

41:46.567 --> 41:49.366
but although they seemed
to flail away from the pressure,

41:49.367 --> 41:53.299
surely they're not undamaged
by all that psi.

41:53.300 --> 41:55.666
[ Laughing ] Oh!

41:55.667 --> 41:57.899
I got a broken wrist
right here, Jamie.

41:57.900 --> 41:59.766
Yeah, I'd... I'd say so.

41:59.767 --> 42:02.466
Look on... it whipped it around,
both of these.

42:02.467 --> 42:05.232
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We got some lacerations here.

42:05.233 --> 42:06.699
Maybe some broken fingers.

42:06.700 --> 42:07.832
Yeah.

42:07.833 --> 42:10.366
We got a compound fracture
in the finger.

42:10.367 --> 42:12.766
Oh, and check this out.
There's a...

42:12.767 --> 42:15.299
There's plastic
embedded in the flesh.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.432
Right.

42:16.433 --> 42:18.432
That's gonna be part
of what ruined your day,

42:18.433 --> 42:20.299
although you won't be able
to hear anyone

42:20.300 --> 42:22.099
tell you about
how stupid you just were,

42:22.100 --> 42:24.399
'cause you'll have
permanent hearing damage.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.699
Yep, not only
was the force enough

42:26.700 --> 42:28.766
to force bones through flesh,

42:28.767 --> 42:34.166
a halo of plastic shrapnel
was embedded into the hands.

42:34.167 --> 42:36.166
Look, we called this episode
"do try this at home"

42:36.167 --> 42:38.266
because we've spent
more than a decade

42:38.267 --> 42:40.532
doing all sorts
of random dangerous things

42:40.533 --> 42:42.800
that you should totally not
try yourself.

42:44.767 --> 42:45.933
Aaahh!

42:47.567 --> 42:48.866
But we had to end it here

42:48.867 --> 42:50.966
with something we hear
about a lot of people doing,

42:50.967 --> 42:52.866
and we wanted to make it crystal
clear for you,

42:52.867 --> 42:54.066
and we think we have,

42:54.067 --> 42:56.832
that putting dry ice and water
in a soda bottle

42:56.833 --> 42:58.166
is no laughing matter.

42:58.167 --> 43:00.599
You could be permanently damaged

43:00.600 --> 43:04.366
by "playing around"
with something this dangerous.

43:04.367 --> 43:06.133
Don't do it.

43:10.167 --> 43:14.399
So, we have microwaved,
speed boated, synchronized,

43:14.400 --> 43:18.166
levitated, frothed,
suspended, and exploded.

43:18.167 --> 43:19.632
And out of all of that,

43:19.633 --> 43:22.699
four are definitely
too dangerous to try at home.

43:22.700 --> 43:25.499
And when it comes to the others,
please make sure

43:25.500 --> 43:28.700
you're with a responsible adult
and use your common sense.
