[theme music]

00:07.908 --> 00:10.178
Crystal, we're supposed
to go out tonight.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.845
I can't believe you've
known about it for a week,

00:11.945 --> 00:15.649
and you still haven't even
found a babysitter yet.

00:15.749 --> 00:18.819
Well, there's gotta be some
responsible teenage girls

00:18.919 --> 00:20.454
out there.

00:20.554 --> 00:25.326
Let me ask Becky or Darlene,
maybe they know somebody.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.828
OK, I'll call back later.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.063
Bye.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.831
Can't find anybody
she trusts, huh?

00:30.931 --> 00:32.200
No.

00:32.300 --> 00:35.436
She might have to end up leaving
them kids with her husband.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.904
Give me that.
That's it.

00:37.004 --> 00:37.938
You're done.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.708
But I wanna get
out of the dungeon.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.544
Well, don't we all?

00:43.644 --> 00:44.645
Mom.

00:44.745 --> 00:45.879
You're not spending
the rest of your life

00:45.979 --> 00:47.248
playing video games.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.150
There's nothing else to do.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.419
Oh, sure there is.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.820
When your mom and
I were your age,

00:52.920 --> 00:57.325
kids used to ride their bikes
all over, and build tree forts,

00:57.425 --> 01:02.730
and dress up dogs in funny
clothes, all kinds of stuff.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.798
Fine, I'll go
outside if I have to.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.970
Dress up dogs?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.772
Yeah.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.041
Little white dog
with the black eye.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.176
That wasn't us.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.711
That was the Little Rascals.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.180
Oh, yeah.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.721
Well, I just remembered.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.958
I've gotta make sandwiches
for Dan's stupid poker game.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.526
Why are you doing it?

01:32.626 --> 01:34.562
Well, 'cause I was gonna
clean out the fridge anyway.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.330
This way, I save on trash bags.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.602
Hey.
- Hey.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.471
What's wrong?

01:43.571 --> 01:45.539
Mark drove me
home from school.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.375
Oh, well, but
you're sad though,

01:47.475 --> 01:49.843
so everything's good, right?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.979
Will you cut it out?

01:52.079 --> 01:54.448
How does that make
you feel, Becky?

01:54.548 --> 01:55.416
I don't know.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.785
Sometimes when he
looks at me, I--

01:57.885 --> 01:59.820
- Still getting chills, huh?
- Yeah.

01:59.920 --> 02:00.754
Yuck.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.223
Roseanne.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.892
I thought you went and
told him to date other girls.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.227
Yeah, but he's not.

02:06.327 --> 02:09.297
Well, if he can't do that
one, simple, little thing, then

02:09.397 --> 02:11.899
I guess he doesn't
care about you at all.

02:11.999 --> 02:15.369
[theme music]

03:06.520 --> 03:08.256
And here's a picture
of little Angela

03:08.356 --> 03:10.791
at three weeks with her
Auntie Roseanne holding her.

03:10.891 --> 03:11.692
She's so beautiful.

03:11.792 --> 03:12.726
Gorgeous.

03:12.826 --> 03:16.364
Aw, look how cute I am.

03:16.464 --> 03:19.066
Well, Crystal, how does it
feel having two babies at home

03:19.166 --> 03:20.200
now?

03:20.301 --> 03:22.236
Well, since I've been
breastfeeding Angela,

03:22.336 --> 03:24.505
I've been kind of
worried about little Ed.

03:24.605 --> 03:25.739
He seems real jealous.

03:25.839 --> 03:26.640
Why?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.942
He's old enough to be weened.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.211
Well, I want him to grow
up feeling secure and loved.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.413
Well, get over it.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.916
You'll go to one of his
school plays or something.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.318
Hey, Rosie.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.487
Hey, Calvin.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.054
Who's that?

03:41.154 --> 03:42.656
Customer from the shop.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.091
Hey, wait a minute.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.360
Hey, Calvin, how's
your bike running?

03:46.460 --> 03:47.928
Good.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.997
All right, just turned
into a business meeting.

03:50.097 --> 03:53.166
I can write the whole thing off.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.202
Are you picking up the check?

03:55.303 --> 03:57.671
Just the stub.

03:57.771 --> 03:58.772
Hey, everybody,
sorry I'm late.

03:58.872 --> 03:59.673
Hey.

03:59.773 --> 04:00.841
Where have you been?

04:00.941 --> 04:02.109
I just got some bad news.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.010
JACKIE: Uh-oh.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.111
ROSEANNE: What's wrong?

04:04.211 --> 04:05.045
No, never mind.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.980
I don't wanna ruin
everybody's fun.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.817
Well, you already have, so
you might as well spill it.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.719
Chuckie lost his job.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.153
Oh, man.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.556
Man, I thought
he had seniority.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.891
He did, that's why they
didn't lay him off last week

04:17.991 --> 04:20.260
with the rest of his shift.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.695
I don't believe it.

04:21.795 --> 04:22.596
It's all over.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.998
Wellman Plastics is history.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.368
Well, he'll find another job.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.736
Oh, yeah.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.372
Now that Wellman's is closed,
there'll be plenty of jobs--

04:31.472 --> 04:33.574
bill collectors, repo men.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.976
Oh, I'm really
sorry, Anne-Marie.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.111
Hey, it's happening all over.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.648
Bonnie's losing her job,
and you're losing your job,

04:40.748 --> 04:42.850
and nobody in this
town can afford to buy

04:42.950 --> 04:44.251
a bike from your husband's.

04:44.352 --> 04:48.255
Boy, you're just a
messenger of death, ain't you?

04:48.356 --> 04:49.189
Sorry.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.858
Look, let's get out of here.

04:50.958 --> 04:51.925
We're gonna get all depressed.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.728
We're just gonna drink
ourselves stupid.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.565
All right, let's settle up.

04:57.665 --> 05:01.469
Everybody, chip in 6 bucks,
except for Anne-Marie.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.371
6 bucks?

05:03.471 --> 05:06.407
Let me try to get
the price down here.

05:06.507 --> 05:11.311
Hey, Willy, all our
beers had flies in them.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.813
We were out of little
umbrellas, Roseanne.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.018
Works in your nicer places.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.388
I hate it when
you're short on cash.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.823
You always try and cheap
your way out of the tab.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.292
Well, we all do what
we have to do to get by.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.259
Yep.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.228
Why, once, I called
the company that

05:28.328 --> 05:30.163
makes those instant
potatoes and told them

05:30.263 --> 05:32.332
I found a human hand in the box.

05:32.433 --> 05:35.636
And the scary thing was they
did not sound surprised.

05:35.736 --> 05:36.670
Oh.

05:36.770 --> 05:37.571
Well, don't worry.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.739
We are all gonna make it.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.240
We're just gonna have
to learn how to stretch

05:40.340 --> 05:41.174
those dollars a little.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.443
It can be done.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.211
I was watching this
National Geographic

05:44.311 --> 05:45.779
special on desert people.

05:45.879 --> 05:49.850
Bedouins can live for
three days on one fig.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.119
Well, that don't
do me no good.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.622
My family can't live for
three days on one Bedouin.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.997
I'm telling me you
guys, it really happened.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.733
- Come on, Arnie.
- I swear.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.368
Last night, I was
visited by an alien.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.302
Your bet, Chuckie.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.038
I have a buck.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.840
- I'm in.
- It's true.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.408
I woke up next to this
horrible, skinny-armed,

06:14.508 --> 06:15.643
bug-eyed creature.
- Man, give it a rest.

06:15.743 --> 06:16.910
- Come on, man.
- Stop it, Arnie.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.946
I know, I know, I thought
it was Nancy at first too.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.782
But does Nancy stick long
steel needles into my body,

06:21.882 --> 06:23.684
probing me for information?

06:23.784 --> 06:26.119
Well, you've only been
married a few months.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.855
I'll play.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.157
The thing talked to me, Dan.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.259
It said it was here to
find out about humans.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.728
A thousand million light
years across the galaxy,

06:34.828 --> 06:38.398
and it missed by one house.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.567
I'll call, Chuckie.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.801
What have you got?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.269
Oh, man.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.203
This is embarrassing.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.104
I was just bluffing.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.305
I only got a lousy pair of 5s.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.206
Beats me.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.307
Me too.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.543
Didn't see it coming.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.678
All right!

06:50.778 --> 06:52.713
Man, you guys stink.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.748
Hey, hold on, hold on.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.149
Read them and weep--

06:56.249 --> 06:59.252
8s, two of them.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.121
Dang.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.391
Hey, Chuckie, wasn't it
your turn to bring some beer?

07:04.492 --> 07:05.526
Oh, yeah, yeah.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.660
It's out in the car.
I forgot.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.528
Take a hike.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.666
Hey, man, maybe we should
pitch in on the beer.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.034
I mean, the guy
just got laid off.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.869
That's why we all just
lost to him, genius.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.304
I had three Jacks.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.639
I had a straight.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.440
Why didn't you guys tell me?

07:20.541 --> 07:22.543
We did, Arnie.

07:22.643 --> 07:26.146
Oh my god, the aliens
have messed up my mind.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.615
So last night wasn't
their first visit.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.020
All right, brewskis.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.121
All right.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.923
Your deal, Chuckie.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.291
OK, let me see if I can
win some of my money back.

07:38.391 --> 07:39.827
I bet 5 bucks he can.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.094
[thud]
Ow!

07:41.194 --> 07:42.162
Sorry, was that your foot?

07:42.262 --> 07:43.664
[phone ringing]

07:43.764 --> 07:45.165
Deal me out.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.466
Oh, he gets to
answer the phone.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.768
That is not fair.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.370
Hey, Calvin, what's it doing?

07:50.470 --> 07:54.007
Oh, man, how the
hell did that happen?

07:54.107 --> 07:55.042
Do me a favor--

07:55.142 --> 07:57.177
sit on him, I'll be right there.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.379
Mark went and got himself
drunk down at the Lobo.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.280
Mark?

08:00.380 --> 08:01.749
Is he old enough to--
- No.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.150
I better get down
there before he gets

08:03.250 --> 08:05.018
himself in some major trouble.
- You want me to come with you?

08:05.118 --> 08:05.986
I'll go, I'll go.

08:06.086 --> 08:06.954
Oh, that's
convenient, and leave

08:07.054 --> 08:08.889
me here alone with Mr. Lucky?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.290
Well, you guys
stay and have fun.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.391
I'll be right back.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.562
Don't tell Becky or
Darlene where I went.

08:14.662 --> 08:18.265
OK, your bet.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.499
Pass.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.735
Same here.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.903
A quarter.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.204
And remember where you got it.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.624
What happened?

08:43.724 --> 08:45.425
Well, after I called
you, the kid went crazy

08:45.525 --> 08:47.628
and put his fist
through the jukebox.

08:47.728 --> 08:48.662
Oh, great.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.830
Yeah, Willy wanted
to call the cops,

08:49.930 --> 08:50.931
butt I talked him out of it.

08:51.031 --> 08:51.899
Thanks, man.

08:51.999 --> 08:52.933
Hey.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.101
Hey, Dan.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.669
What the hell's
wrong with you?

08:55.769 --> 08:56.570
Nothing.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.772
I hurt my hand, that's all.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.742
Whoa, gonna need a
couple of stitches.

09:01.842 --> 09:02.776
Let's go.

09:02.876 --> 09:03.677
Hey, wait a minute.

09:03.777 --> 09:04.945
What about my jukebox?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.079
Well, Willy, I
guess you're just

09:06.179 --> 09:07.648
gonna have to find
another place to store

09:07.748 --> 09:10.718
your Jim Nabors records.

09:10.818 --> 09:11.952
That's very funny, Dan.

09:12.052 --> 09:12.853
He'll pay for it.

09:12.953 --> 09:13.754
He works for me.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.288
I'll take it out of his check.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.256
Hey.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.658
Hey!

09:17.758 --> 09:20.861
I don't wanna see you in here
ever again, you understand me?

09:20.961 --> 09:22.763
Huh?

09:22.863 --> 09:24.331
I'll explain it to him later.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.298
Come on, let's go.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.901
Get somebody to
look at that hand.

09:28.001 --> 09:28.902
Listen, don't tell Becky--

09:29.002 --> 09:30.337
Easy.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.840
'Cause, uh-- she'll
kill me, and she'll never

09:32.940 --> 09:33.874
wanna see me again.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.609
Don't worry, I'm
not gonna tell her.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.277
Hey, Calvin, thanks
for your help, man.

09:37.377 --> 09:38.979
Yeah, no problem.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.281
Whoa, I gotcha, I gotcha.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.717
You're OK, Dan.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.352
You're my man.

09:45.452 --> 09:51.158
My man Dan, Dan the man,
Dan Dan the Dan man.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.426
OK, now use one with my name.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.095
OK, how about this?

09:55.195 --> 09:57.497
Mark mark, you puke in my
truck, and I'll kill you.

10:08.909 --> 10:09.710
Hey.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.610
Hey, Dan.

10:10.711 --> 10:11.679
How's it going?

10:11.779 --> 10:14.081
Well, we let Chuckie
win about 20 bucks

10:14.181 --> 10:15.515
so he wasn't playing
with his own money,

10:15.615 --> 10:17.484
then we started
to play for real.

10:17.584 --> 10:20.153
Yeah, and he gave it all back
in like a minute and a half.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.689
Oh, man, where is he?

10:21.789 --> 10:23.156
He's in the john.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.224
So what now?

10:24.324 --> 10:25.759
We've gotta let him
win all over again?

10:25.859 --> 10:27.294
Hey, come on, this
is getting ridiculous.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.595
You know, I've been
out of work before,

10:28.696 --> 10:29.930
and no one's ever let me win.

10:30.030 --> 10:33.533
It's enough we let you sit
at the grownup table, Arnie.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.434
Hey, Dan.

10:34.534 --> 10:35.803
How'd it go with Mark?

10:35.903 --> 10:38.538
Well, by the time I got there,
he punched out the jukebox.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.439
Any stitches?

10:39.539 --> 10:40.640
Two or three.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.042
Oh, man, that's nothing.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.610
I remember the time I got hit
in the head with a beer bottle.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.078
Nearly lost an eye!

10:45.178 --> 10:46.113
Took 12 stitches!

10:46.213 --> 10:47.247
But it's underneath
the eyebrow

10:47.347 --> 10:50.818
so you can't hardly see it!

10:50.918 --> 10:52.185
Hey, Art's new to the game.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.854
Maybe he wants to hear it.

10:53.954 --> 10:57.758
I'm sure Art knows you've been
hit in the head a few times.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.527
But did you know it
was with a beer bottle?

11:00.627 --> 11:02.329
So where's Mark now?

11:02.429 --> 11:05.298
Oh, I left him
at his apartment,

11:05.398 --> 11:07.868
drooling and mumbling
my daughter's name.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.503
Sounds like son-in-law
material to me.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.840
Oh, come on, we
all been there.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.674
Becky's been giving
him a real rough time,

11:14.775 --> 11:16.076
and he needed to
blow off some steam.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.378
I feel bad for the kid.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.647
Where's the pizza?

11:20.748 --> 11:22.182
What pizza?

11:22.282 --> 11:24.417
Well, Becky and I came looking
for you like an hour ago,

11:24.517 --> 11:25.786
and Arnie said you
went out for pizza.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.487
No, no, I never said that.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.189
I said I had to go to the shop.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.557
Mm, sounded like pizza.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.829
- You went to the shop?
- Yes.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.798
In the middle of your
male bonding frenzy?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.434
Is everything OK?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.003
Yeah, yeah.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.838
The alarm company called.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.107
The alarm went off at the shop,
I had to go down and check in.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.141
What happened?

11:48.241 --> 11:49.076
Oh, nothing.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.677
Just a short in the wiring.

11:50.778 --> 11:51.711
Hey, pizza sounds great.

11:51.812 --> 11:52.612
You guys up for pizza?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.114
Yeah.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.649
You guys go on back
upstairs, and I'll order it,

11:56.750 --> 11:57.985
and I'll call you
when it gets here.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.119
Oh, right.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.253
By the time he calls us,
all that will be left

12:00.353 --> 12:01.354
is what's stuck to their shirts.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.227
Lying to the kids, Dan?

12:07.327 --> 12:08.228
Mm, mm.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.063
Hey, I promised Mark.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.232
And nobody says anything
to Roseanne either.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.267
Oh, now he lies to his wife.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.936
Where will this end?

12:16.036 --> 12:17.704
Hey, you gotta lie to
your wife once in a while.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.006
Yeah, I'll hold.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.740
I mean, what about when they
try out them new recipes,

12:20.841 --> 12:22.542
and you hate it?
- Yeah.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.477
I always tell my
wife I got a cold,

12:24.577 --> 12:27.114
and I can't taste a thing.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.749
Hey, that's way better than
hocking it up into a napkin,

12:29.850 --> 12:32.652
isn't it?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.188
Dan's right, you gotta lie
to your wife once in a while.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.357
I mean, if just
once, I had said,

12:37.457 --> 12:40.027
honey, I don't mind that you're
sleeping with my business

12:40.127 --> 12:42.229
partner, I'd still be married.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.230
Bummer.

12:43.330 --> 12:46.233
Man.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.068
Well, they lie to us too.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.137
Last year, Roseanne smashed
up the front of my truck

12:50.237 --> 12:52.172
and swore it happened while
it was parked at the mall.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.506
Oh, that's an old one.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.175
- Did you call her on it, Dan?
- What?

12:55.275 --> 12:56.076
Are you kidding me?

12:56.176 --> 12:57.444
And waste all that guilt?

12:57.544 --> 13:00.180
To this day, when I mention
how good my truck used to look,

13:00.280 --> 13:01.949
I get chocolate
cake for dessert.

13:02.049 --> 13:02.983
Whoa.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.318
If I squeeze out
a couple of tears--

13:05.418 --> 13:06.219
Cool Whip.

13:16.897 --> 13:17.697
Hey, Dan.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.932
Huh?

13:19.032 --> 13:20.333
Now you say the fire
department went down there,

13:20.433 --> 13:22.169
and they checked, but they
didn't find anything, right?

13:22.269 --> 13:24.237
No, it was a
false alarm, honey.

13:24.337 --> 13:27.140
Well, did they check the wires
in the walls and everything?

13:27.240 --> 13:28.708
Everything.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.243
Well, how do they know
it was a fire alarm?

13:30.343 --> 13:31.644
It could've been
the burglar alarm.

13:31.744 --> 13:32.579
They sound the same.

13:32.679 --> 13:33.646
Roseanne.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.748
Well, Dan, the fire
department wouldn't

13:35.849 --> 13:37.417
know if anything was stolen.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.019
They wouldn't notice
a burglar in there

13:39.119 --> 13:40.954
unless the guy was on fire.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.622
I checked.

13:42.722 --> 13:43.690
Nothing's missing.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.893
No flaming burglars.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.194
What about the safe?

13:47.294 --> 13:48.428
[sigh]

13:48.528 --> 13:50.697
It's all there--

13:50.797 --> 13:53.566
your grandmother's
ring, your good watch,

13:53.666 --> 13:54.935
the earrings you
never get to wear

13:55.035 --> 13:58.238
because I never take you any
place nice enough, all there.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.574
What about the gold card?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.376
What gold card?

14:03.476 --> 14:04.744
I knew it.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.513
They stole the gold card.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.848
We don't have a gold card.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.517
Not now.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.452
What are you talking about?

14:12.552 --> 14:14.721
I got a gold card in
the mail the other day.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.256
It has a $5,000 limit.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.091
I was saving it in
case we needed it.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.461
What fish brain company
gave us a gold card?

14:21.561 --> 14:24.464
Well, they ask you for
your annual income and

14:24.564 --> 14:26.233
your social security number.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.369
Maybe I switched them.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.403
Oh, man.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.039
Well, I just didn't see it.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.073
It's a little flat thing.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.307
It could've been up
against the wall.

14:34.407 --> 14:37.044
Uh-uh, it was in a
great, big, white envelope.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.879
Well, I'll look for
it in the morning.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.148
No, how are we
supposed to sleep

14:41.248 --> 14:44.217
if somebody's out there
charging us into the poor house?

14:44.317 --> 14:45.452
They can't buy anything.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.486
It's 2:00 in the morning.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.955
Everything's closed.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.256
Yeah, here.

14:49.356 --> 14:52.192
But the burglar could
charge tickets and fly

14:52.292 --> 14:53.826
to where something is open.

14:53.927 --> 14:56.796
You know, in some parts of the
world, it's yesterday, Dan.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.900
We could be broke
before it's now.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.570
How many beers did you
have down at the Lobo?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.738
Go on down there and
check on that card.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.140
Honey.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.009
Come on now, I'm not gonna be
able to sleep till you get it,

15:09.109 --> 15:10.343
and neither are you.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.212
OK, OK.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.147
I'll go all the way down
to the shop in the middle

15:14.247 --> 15:15.882
of the night, find
the card, bring

15:15.983 --> 15:17.484
it back so that you can sleep.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.818
OK?

15:18.918 --> 15:19.919
ROSEANNE: Thank you, honey.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.294
Lie to me, will you?

15:40.540 --> 15:42.409
(WHISPERING) Hey.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.778
(SHOUTING) Hey,
Mark, how's it going?

15:45.878 --> 15:46.713
[drilling]

15:46.813 --> 15:48.148
Please, stop, will you?

15:48.248 --> 15:50.950
Stop.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.685
How's your hand?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.487
Hurts like hell, man.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.323
Well.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.325
Let's see if we can keep
it wet and dirty all day.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.292
Maybe we can get it infected.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.497
You didn't tell Becky
about anything, did you?

16:04.597 --> 16:06.633
No, I didn't.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.536
What about, you
know, the other one?

16:09.636 --> 16:11.371
No, I did not tell my
wife, for which I paid

16:11.471 --> 16:12.739
dearly, much as you will today.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.744
Thanks, I owe you.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.612
Yeah, you do.

16:19.712 --> 16:20.713
I mean it.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.516
You know, I really
do care about Becky.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.785
I mean, she's real
good for me, you know?

16:25.885 --> 16:28.421
If she found out about
last night, well,

16:28.521 --> 16:31.291
she'd never see me again,
so you saved my butt.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.326
You're a real friend.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.595
Let me correct
a few points here.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.130
I am Becky's father.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.132
By definition, therefore,
not your friend.

16:39.232 --> 16:42.635
Secondly, I am your boss, which
still makes me not your friend.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.372
So in my official capacity
as not your friend,

16:45.472 --> 16:47.740
let me tell you how it's
gonna be here from now on.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.142
I ever catch you
under the influence

16:49.242 --> 16:50.743
again, not only are you
finished with Becky,

16:50.843 --> 16:53.513
you're out of a job.

16:53.613 --> 16:54.414
OK.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.482
Oh, one more thing.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.250
I picked up the tab
for those stitches.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.351
I'll pay you back.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.686
Yes, you will.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.222
But until then, I own
them, which means I can

17:02.322 --> 17:03.523
rip them out any time I want.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.498
[drilling]

17:27.013 --> 17:27.914
[door closing]

17:28.014 --> 17:28.915
JACKIE: Hey.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.418
Hey.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.086
You bring me any ice cream?

17:33.186 --> 17:34.154
No.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.054
Then go away.

17:38.358 --> 17:41.428
I got gum.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.697
Bet he's letting Mark
take her to the movies.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.166
When did this happen?

17:46.266 --> 17:47.066
I don't know.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.201
Does it even matter?

17:48.301 --> 17:50.737
You just know they're
gonna get back together,

17:50.837 --> 17:54.006
and that is just sickening.

17:54.107 --> 17:57.043
I can't believe Dan would
even let him in the house

17:57.144 --> 17:59.011
after catching him down
at the Lobo like that.

18:01.648 --> 18:02.449
Excuse me?

18:05.718 --> 18:12.625
Oh, man, this is why Dan
is always ticked off at me.

18:16.863 --> 18:17.897
Spill it.

18:17.997 --> 18:20.733
One of the drivers that
I work with was there.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.269
He said that Mark
got really drunk.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.670
He put his hand
through the jukebox.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.739
And Dan had to come down
and smooth everything over.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.276
So that's what's going on.

18:29.376 --> 18:33.079
I knew I was busting
Dan's chops for something,

18:33.180 --> 18:36.216
I just didn't know what.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.584
What are you talking about?

18:37.684 --> 18:39.819
Well, it was such
an obvious lie.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.389
I mean, that alarm
never went off.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.756
How do you know that?

18:43.856 --> 18:47.327
Because I haven't paid the
alarm company for three months.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.930
Well, just don't tell Dan
you heard it from me, OK?

18:51.030 --> 18:52.899
I'm not even gonna
tell him that I know.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.667
BECKY: We're leaving, Mom.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.503
Be home early.

18:56.603 --> 18:57.404
We'll see.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.442
You're-- you're
just gonna let her go?

19:02.542 --> 19:04.177
What if he's been
drinking again?

19:04.277 --> 19:05.245
You're gonna trust him?

19:05.345 --> 19:07.547
No, I don't trust
him, but I trust Dan.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.449
I mean, he loves
Becky too, you know?

19:09.549 --> 19:13.052
If he's letting her go, he must
have some stupid reason for it.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.487
Hey.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.788
Hey.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.190
Why, Jackie, what a surprise.

19:21.761 --> 19:22.962
How was work, sweetheart?

19:23.062 --> 19:23.996
Pretty good.

19:24.096 --> 19:24.897
Great.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.238
So?

19:31.338 --> 19:33.906
You're gonna totally let him
off the hook after lying to you?

19:34.006 --> 19:36.643
Oh, Jackie, I wish I could.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.649
Oh, Dan.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.484
DAN: Yes?

19:44.584 --> 19:46.052
Becky and Mark
are dating again.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.487
What do you think of that?

19:47.587 --> 19:50.156
Well, we just gotta hope
Mark will turn over a new leaf.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.262
How'd he hurt his hand?

19:55.362 --> 20:01.468
He, uh-- cut it down
at the shop on a machine.

20:01.568 --> 20:02.935
Is it bad?

20:03.035 --> 20:04.404
Couple stitches.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.873
Well, he could sue us, Dan.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.208
He won't sue us.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.478
Well, what if the whole thing
with Becky turns sour again,

20:11.578 --> 20:13.813
then he decides
that he hates us?

20:13.913 --> 20:15.114
We're insured.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.015
Oh, really?

20:18.918 --> 20:19.719
Where's the policy?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.027
At the shop.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.265
Dan.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.700
Roseanne, I just got here.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.601
I'm tired.

20:34.701 --> 20:35.702
I'm hungry.

20:35.802 --> 20:39.839
I really, really,
really wanna know, Dan.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.641
OK.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.311
I'll go down to the shop.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.345
In my beat up truck.

20:52.452 --> 20:57.657
That reminds me, I
gotta get some Cool Whip.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.560

21:07.400 --> 21:09.035
Darlene, Mom wants you
to go down to the mini mart

21:09.135 --> 21:11.938
and pick up some Cool Whip.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.973
Well, why don't you do it?

21:14.073 --> 21:15.775
I'm doing my homework.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.110
That's a lame excuse, Becky.

21:18.210 --> 21:21.414
Well, only from you, Darlene.

21:21.514 --> 21:24.317
She left some money
for you in her purse.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.952
I don't believe I have
to run down to the store

21:26.052 --> 21:28.321
to get, like, one thing
just because Mom forgot

21:28.421 --> 21:30.022
it when she went shopping.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.759
I'm so sick of running these
stupid, little, crappy errands.

21:32.859 --> 21:35.328
I swear, one of these days, I'm
just gonna walk out that door,

21:35.428 --> 21:38.965
and I am never coming back.

21:39.065 --> 21:42.469
And today is the day.

21:42.569 --> 21:45.538
