WEBVTT

00:08.491 --> 00:11.077
South Beach,
are you ready to party?!

00:11.077 --> 00:12.328
It's going to be
off the hook!

00:12.328 --> 00:14.414
Spring break is here!

00:58.624 --> 01:00.251
All right, ladies, this ...

01:00.251 --> 01:03.212
this is for Babes
on Break.

01:04.254 --> 01:06.257
You got to show
America what you got.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.426
All right?

01:08.426 --> 01:09.761
Ready?

01:09.761 --> 01:11.262
One ...

01:11.262 --> 01:13.389
two ...

01:13.389 --> 01:14.432
three!

01:19.020 --> 01:20.062
Oh, my god.

01:24.859 --> 01:26.235
I got a t-shirt.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.423
Dude ...

01:49.509 --> 01:50.885
where's the car?

01:51.844 --> 01:53.930
Dude, where are we?

02:02.980 --> 02:04.107
Hey!

02:04.524 --> 02:06.526
You better get up.
Tide's coming in.

02:07.610 --> 02:08.693
Hey, wake up.

02:09.946 --> 02:11.030
Hey, what...?

02:11.239 --> 02:11.989
Whoa! My...!
Geez!

02:11.989 --> 02:13.157
What the...?
Oh, geez!

02:15.243 --> 02:16.786
Let's get out of here!

02:19.956 --> 02:22.041
Hate to state the obvious,

02:22.542 --> 02:24.627
but her neck's
been broken.

02:27.922 --> 02:30.007
Sunburn says
she's a tourist.

02:30.007 --> 02:31.592
You know what
that means.

02:32.301 --> 02:34.345
Come down here,
looking to blow off steam ...

02:34.345 --> 02:36.264
and they think the
rules don't apply.

02:36.264 --> 02:38.099
Welcome to spring break.

02:38.599 --> 02:40.184
How'd this happen, Sugar?

02:40.518 --> 02:43.771
All you wanted was a
week of fun and sun.

02:44.272 --> 02:47.066
Good times, hanging out
with your friends.

02:47.066 --> 02:49.444
Should've been the
time of her life, Alexx ...

02:50.069 --> 02:51.320
instead of the end of it.

03:27.106 --> 03:30.234
1x21 Spring Break

03:48.876 --> 03:51.087
Guys who found her,
slept out here last night,

03:51.087 --> 03:52.005
twenty feet away.

03:52.005 --> 03:53.298
They didn't see or
hear anything.

03:53.298 --> 03:56.634
Drunken, passed-out kids;
I guess that's possible.

03:56.634 --> 03:58.636
Hang on a second, guys.
Hang on.

03:58.636 --> 03:59.762
I want a new one,

03:59.762 --> 04:01.681
and let's put her in
the VIP room, please.

04:01.681 --> 04:02.724
All right?

04:02.932 --> 04:04.892
New body bag, copy that.

04:07.478 --> 04:08.896
Maybe she was dumped.

04:09.939 --> 04:10.940
Nope.

04:11.149 --> 04:12.108
No drag marks.

04:12.108 --> 04:13.943
It means she was killed right here.

04:13.943 --> 04:15.320
This time of year,

04:15.320 --> 04:16.904
all the nuts roll
downhill to South Florida.

04:16.904 --> 04:17.738
Speed?

04:17.738 --> 04:18.990
Big party.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.116
How do you figure?

04:21.159 --> 04:22.118
It's motor oil.

04:23.161 --> 04:25.580
Only snowbirds would be dumb
enough to park way out here.

04:25.580 --> 04:27.373
They're lucky the tide
didn't take their vehicle.

04:27.373 --> 04:30.460
Okay, let's set a grid ten
yards in both directions.

04:30.460 --> 04:31.252
See what we get.

04:31.252 --> 04:32.295
You got it.

04:32.295 --> 04:33.338
All right.

04:48.478 --> 04:50.146
Hey, Blondie.
You're hot.

04:50.146 --> 04:51.522
Flash me.

04:51.522 --> 04:52.607
Why don't you
show me something?

04:52.607 --> 04:54.317
Come on, flash me.
Flash me.

04:54.317 --> 04:56.319
You know you want to.

04:56.736 --> 04:57.528
Is this hot enough for you?

04:57.528 --> 04:59.697
Or you want to see
my weapons permit?

04:59.697 --> 05:00.657
Hey ...

05:00.657 --> 05:02.116
I didn't mean anything.

05:15.338 --> 05:17.215
Motel Manager called it in.

05:18.049 --> 05:19.968
Says there were a hundred
kids out here last night,

05:19.968 --> 05:21.344
and no one saw anything.

05:21.344 --> 05:22.845
Was our vic staying here?

05:22.845 --> 05:23.930
It's hard to say.

05:24.764 --> 05:27.308
They pack these kids,
eight, ten to a room.

05:29.185 --> 05:30.812
Got to go finish up
with the manager.

05:33.731 --> 05:35.233
He hasn't been
down there long.

05:35.233 --> 05:37.819
It usually takes a while
for the body to float.

05:37.819 --> 05:40.238
Body gasses have to
have time to build up.

05:40.238 --> 05:42.156
Well, it looks like
somebody's getting wet.

05:42.156 --> 05:43.950
Music to my ears.

05:55.628 --> 05:57.589
Excuse me, ma'am?
Yeah?

05:57.589 --> 05:58.298
Could we talk to you?

05:58.298 --> 05:59.799
If you promise not
to call me "ma'am".

05:59.799 --> 06:02.302
Your friend is totally hot.

06:02.302 --> 06:03.970
Do you know if he
has a girlfriend?

06:04.012 --> 06:05.054
Uh, not currently.

06:05.054 --> 06:07.140
Well, how old is he?

06:13.146 --> 06:14.522
Cute girls.

06:14.522 --> 06:16.024
Yeah, they thought you
were cute, too.

06:16.024 --> 06:17.483
Oh, yeah?
What'd they say?

06:17.483 --> 06:19.444
They were wondering if you
had a younger brother.

06:21.529 --> 06:22.572
Funny.

06:30.330 --> 06:31.789
Nah, I don't think
he drowned.

06:31.789 --> 06:34.208
There's no foam around
his nostrils or his mouth.

06:34.208 --> 06:36.044
Means there's
no water in his lungs.

06:36.377 --> 06:37.795
He's got scratches
on his feet.

06:37.795 --> 06:38.796
His arms are bruised.

06:38.796 --> 06:40.256
I don't know, it looks like
he's been beaten.

06:40.256 --> 06:41.466
He might've been
wasted, too.

06:41.466 --> 06:44.302
Check out the tag on
his trunks, on backwards.

06:44.302 --> 06:45.094
Something's not right.

06:45.094 --> 06:46.763
We should get him
down to autopsy.

06:46.763 --> 06:47.805
Yeah.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.246
You find something?

07:18.920 --> 07:20.880
Still a little girl, isn't she?

07:31.349 --> 07:33.142
Take a look at this, Horatio.

07:35.561 --> 07:36.521
We've got a biter.

07:36.521 --> 07:39.732
At least six sets
of marks, avulsed.

07:39.732 --> 07:40.942
Most dramatic type.

07:40.942 --> 07:42.569
Bites like this don't
just happen.

07:42.569 --> 07:43.820
So, he's a predator.

07:43.820 --> 07:45.780
Let's see if had a history.

07:46.614 --> 07:48.408
I'll swab for saliva
and semen.

07:48.408 --> 07:49.742
See if there's
anything for CODIS.

07:49.742 --> 07:52.328
Okay, and I will call
the Odontologist.

08:05.758 --> 08:08.845
Hey!
Buddy!

08:08.845 --> 08:10.388
Hey! You want
to get this moving!

08:11.681 --> 08:12.432
Hey!

08:12.432 --> 08:13.725
Ted Zink, Matraca Tequila.

08:13.725 --> 08:15.685
You're in my party area.

08:15.685 --> 08:16.436
Your what?

08:16.436 --> 08:18.354
We're hosting a big
event for the Greeks.

08:18.354 --> 08:20.189
Part of our spring break
marketing package:

08:20.189 --> 08:23.109
Uh, Lauderdale,
Daytona, Miami Beach.

08:23.109 --> 08:24.819
We take the party
wherever the kids are.

08:24.819 --> 08:26.487
You know, you hook them
young, they're yours for life.

08:26.487 --> 08:28.615
Sir, can you read the
yellow tape right there?

08:28.615 --> 08:29.824
It says "crime scene."

08:30.241 --> 08:31.910
Hey, I got permit to be here.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.453
Oh ...
you got a permit.

08:33.453 --> 08:34.662
Yeah, that's right.

08:34.662 --> 08:36.121
From parks and rec.

08:36.414 --> 08:37.582
Well ...

08:38.082 --> 08:40.001
I'm going to let you tell that
to the family of the girl ...

08:40.001 --> 08:41.461
that got murdered
here last night.

08:41.461 --> 08:42.294
Whoa, hold on ...

08:42.294 --> 08:43.171
I'm going to let
you tell them ...

08:43.171 --> 08:45.089
that we can't process
this crime scene ...

08:45.089 --> 08:48.176
because you have a
permit for a party.

08:48.176 --> 08:49.385
You misunderstood me ...

08:49.385 --> 08:52.680
Then I'm going to arrest your
cheap, tequila-pushing ass ...

08:52.680 --> 08:54.390
and have you spend
the night in lockup ...

08:54.390 --> 08:55.600
with all the
drunk-and-disorderlies,

08:55.600 --> 08:59.145
and you can smell the
vomit of the fraternity boys.

08:59.562 --> 09:01.314
You know what?
Maybe I-I ...

09:01.314 --> 09:04.067
maybe I should just
wait until you're finished.

09:04.067 --> 09:06.152
That's a capital idea, Ted.

09:37.642 --> 09:38.935
Three months ago.

09:38.935 --> 09:40.395
Similar murders.

09:46.901 --> 09:48.027
Yes, hello.

09:52.699 --> 09:53.741
Horatio.

09:53.741 --> 09:54.617
It's Alexx.

09:54.617 --> 09:55.910
Hey.
How bad is it?

09:55.910 --> 09:57.203
Bad.

09:57.203 --> 09:58.538
Couldn't recover any semen?

09:58.538 --> 09:59.581
Oh, I recovered it.

09:59.581 --> 10:00.957
Sent it on to CODIS.

10:00.957 --> 10:02.875
Findings are postmortem.

10:03.167 --> 10:06.421
The vaginal tears at five,
six and seven.

10:06.504 --> 10:09.007
No resistance or
compliance by our victim.

10:09.007 --> 10:10.383
Was she unconscious?

10:10.383 --> 10:11.801
I was hoping for that, too.

10:11.801 --> 10:13.636
So I swabbed her wounds.

10:14.596 --> 10:17.557
No blood was circulating
at the time of penetration.

10:17.890 --> 10:19.434
She was already dead.

10:20.059 --> 10:21.394
All right, Alexx, thank you.

10:49.464 --> 10:50.506
Rachel Moon.

10:57.597 --> 10:58.723
That's her picture.

10:58.723 --> 11:01.059
The birth date says 1979.

11:01.059 --> 11:02.810
There's no way
she's 24 years old.

11:02.810 --> 11:04.938
Well, if it's a fake,
it's a good one.

11:04.938 --> 11:07.273
There's no glue lines,
no bumps.

11:07.690 --> 11:09.651
Lamination thickness
is dead-on.

11:10.693 --> 11:13.613
Whatever happened to just
stealing your older sister's I.D.?

11:13.821 --> 11:15.531
These days,
you don't have to.

11:15.531 --> 11:16.824
Any college kid with
a color printer and ...

11:16.824 --> 11:19.244
a high-rez scanner can
rip these things out.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.752
This is quality work.
State seal.

11:27.752 --> 11:30.630
Ultraviolet ink.
Security layer.

11:31.673 --> 11:33.049
Man, this guy's good.

11:38.429 --> 11:39.681
Got him.

11:39.681 --> 11:41.766
He missed the third layer
of the laminate.

12:02.620 --> 12:05.039
We traced the license
back to a Rachel Moon,

12:05.039 --> 12:06.082
Michigan State.

12:07.625 --> 12:09.544
We faxed her a
picture of our victim.

12:09.544 --> 12:11.838
She I.D.'D her.
Some girl in her dorm.

12:11.838 --> 12:13.256
Tiffany Heitzenrader.

12:13.256 --> 12:14.465
How old is Tiffany?

12:14.465 --> 12:15.717
Just turned 19.

12:16.134 --> 12:17.510
She's homecoming queen.

12:17.510 --> 12:19.721
Varsity soccer.
Dean's list.

12:19.721 --> 12:21.222
All-american girl.

12:22.265 --> 12:23.683
Yeah, her sister's
flying in.

12:23.683 --> 12:25.143
Her parents are just
too broken up.

12:25.143 --> 12:26.686
Let me know when
she gets here.

12:51.085 --> 12:53.546
CODIS got a hit on the
semen from our beach victim.

12:53.630 --> 12:54.547
You get a donor?

12:54.547 --> 12:57.091
Carson Mackie, 28.
Owns a video company.

12:57.091 --> 12:58.343
New Jersey address.

12:58.343 --> 13:00.678
Convicted of statutory
rape in '93.

13:00.678 --> 13:02.263
He was 19, she was 17.

13:02.263 --> 13:03.640
State police make contact?

13:03.640 --> 13:05.391
No, no.
He's on a business trip.

13:05.391 --> 13:06.768
You want to guess where?

13:08.019 --> 13:09.229
A hotel on Collins.

13:09.229 --> 13:11.397
The Silver Palm.
Steps away from the ocean.

13:11.397 --> 13:13.775
Let's go talk to Mr. Mackie.
Let's do.

13:27.163 --> 13:28.706
All right now, ladies ...

13:29.123 --> 13:30.750
spring break comes
but once a year.

13:30.750 --> 13:31.876
What are you
going to show me?

13:33.544 --> 13:35.129
Will you see our faces?

13:35.421 --> 13:37.215
Oh, believe me,
if you take off your top,

13:37.215 --> 13:39.634
people won't be
looking at your face.

13:39.634 --> 13:40.969
Come on, come on,

13:40.969 --> 13:43.304
Show me something.
I don't know.

13:43.304 --> 13:44.097
Carson Mackie?

13:44.097 --> 13:44.889
There's no pressure, you know.

13:44.889 --> 13:46.266
If you want some privacy,
we can go in the cabana.

13:46.266 --> 13:48.726
MDPD. We need a
few words with you.

13:48.726 --> 13:50.645
Yeah, I'll be with you in ...
in a minute.

13:50.645 --> 13:52.105
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
guys, guys.

13:52.105 --> 13:53.356
Keep rolling,
keep shooting.

13:53.356 --> 13:55.858
Hey, Carson.
That's a wrap.

13:59.946 --> 14:01.447
So what is this about?

14:03.533 --> 14:04.617
So you, uh ...

14:04.951 --> 14:07.537
you bird-dog girls
for babes on break?

14:07.537 --> 14:09.872
Is that how it works?
I own the company.

14:10.623 --> 14:12.458
I invite girls to
be on camera.

14:12.458 --> 14:13.793
My crew shoots it.

14:14.836 --> 14:15.920
May I?

14:18.006 --> 14:19.966
Well, hell, you're a
regular corporate giant.

14:19.966 --> 14:22.510
Yes, sir, he's a CEO.

14:23.553 --> 14:24.554
Do you ...

14:24.637 --> 14:27.974
recognize this young lady,
Tiffany Heitzenrader?

14:28.683 --> 14:29.934
No.
Pretty girl ...

14:29.934 --> 14:31.519
figured you might
remember her.

14:31.853 --> 14:34.188
Girls like her are a dime
a dozen in my world.

14:34.731 --> 14:36.691
Here's how this
one is different.

14:36.816 --> 14:38.943
Somebody recently
broke her neck,

14:38.943 --> 14:40.111
and now she's dead.

14:40.653 --> 14:41.779
That's too bad.

14:41.779 --> 14:43.281
You seem concerned.

14:43.364 --> 14:44.616
Here's the other difference.

14:44.824 --> 14:46.868
We found your
semen inside of her.

14:46.868 --> 14:48.745
Medical examiner says ...

14:48.745 --> 14:50.413
physical evidence
was postmortem.

14:50.788 --> 14:52.457
Do you know what
that means, Fellini?

14:54.000 --> 14:54.792
No ...

14:54.792 --> 14:56.628
It means you had sex
with a dead girl.

14:56.628 --> 14:58.421
After you snapped
her neck.

14:58.421 --> 14:59.631
Whoa, whoa, whoa ...

14:59.631 --> 15:02.550
I-I didn't ...
I didn't snap her neck.

15:03.301 --> 15:05.720
I thought she
was drunk.

15:05.720 --> 15:06.971
I mean, it's spring
break, right?

15:06.971 --> 15:09.390
I'm not the first guy to find a
girl passed out on the beach.

15:16.147 --> 15:17.649
So you want me
to believe ...

15:17.649 --> 15:19.442
that you're capable
of having sex ...

15:19.442 --> 15:20.777
with a dead young girl?

15:21.819 --> 15:23.154
That's how it happened, man.

15:23.488 --> 15:25.740
You know,
it makes one wonder ...

15:25.740 --> 15:27.492
what else you're
capable of.

15:28.326 --> 15:29.369
Detective?

15:46.276 --> 15:47.735
Just got a hit on AFIS.

15:47.861 --> 15:49.863
Pool boy is Trey Hanson,

15:49.863 --> 15:51.531
19 years old,
from Indianapolis.

15:51.531 --> 15:53.908
Why was he in the system?
Prior for possession.

15:53.908 --> 15:55.660
Under an ounce.
Well, you were right.

15:55.660 --> 15:57.370
Mr. Hanson didn't drown.

15:57.370 --> 15:58.288
Then what killed him?

15:58.288 --> 15:59.831
Subarachnoid hemorrhage.

15:59.831 --> 16:01.457
Had an aneurysm?

16:01.457 --> 16:04.043
Weak spot in the artery
swells up like a balloon.

16:04.043 --> 16:06.212
Any kind of pressure
inside the head ...

16:08.214 --> 16:10.383
a bump, a sudden jerk,
a sneeze,

16:10.383 --> 16:11.426
and the balloon goes ...

16:12.093 --> 16:13.970
Don't know if it was born,

16:13.970 --> 16:15.638
formed, or caused
by trauma.

16:15.889 --> 16:17.891
It's likely he didn't
even know he had it.

16:18.308 --> 16:20.268
What about the scratching
and the bruising?

16:20.268 --> 16:21.644
Most of it's old.

16:21.644 --> 16:23.146
Days and weeks.

16:23.146 --> 16:25.940
If he was getting beaten up,
it was regularly,

16:26.149 --> 16:27.817
except for this one.

16:29.194 --> 16:30.862
It's perimortem.

16:31.196 --> 16:34.824
Can't tell if it was
before or after death,

16:34.824 --> 16:37.327
but it may have been what
caused the aneurysm to burst.

16:37.327 --> 16:39.162
Poor guy probably didn't
know what hit him.

16:39.162 --> 16:40.747
Maybe someone else did.

16:46.419 --> 16:47.170
This the one?

16:47.170 --> 16:48.838
Yeah, the front desk
told Bernstein ...

16:48.838 --> 16:51.257
that Trey Hanson was
registered in room 206.

16:51.257 --> 16:52.800
Him and some friends.

16:53.843 --> 16:54.928
I got it.

16:57.430 --> 16:58.389
Yo, what took
you so long?

16:58.389 --> 16:59.390
Your ad said a half hour.

16:59.390 --> 17:02.185
Officer Delko and Duquesne,
Miami-Dade Crime Lab.

17:02.185 --> 17:03.269
Mind if we come in?

17:04.103 --> 17:06.314
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, come on in.

17:10.818 --> 17:11.736
Sorry about that.

17:12.779 --> 17:14.155
Thought you were
the pizza guy.

17:14.446 --> 17:15.615
Yeah, no worries.

17:15.615 --> 17:17.700
We just came here to ask
you some questions ...

17:17.825 --> 17:18.910
about your roommate.

17:19.661 --> 17:20.744
Trey?

17:20.744 --> 17:22.163
Oh, he-he's not here, man.

17:22.163 --> 17:23.665
It's a mighty tidy room.

17:24.374 --> 17:25.500
Know where he is?

17:25.500 --> 17:26.792
No. No.

17:26.792 --> 17:28.545
I haven't seen him
since last night.

17:28.545 --> 17:29.546
You guys?

17:29.546 --> 17:31.506
Dude, you can't get a power
booster in the middle of the game.

17:31.506 --> 17:32.799
Can, too.
Can not.

17:32.799 --> 17:34.300
Can, too.
Oh, yeah.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.094
Two for flinching.

17:36.094 --> 17:38.012
Oh, yeah?

17:38.012 --> 17:39.514
I like it.
Thank you.

17:39.514 --> 17:40.974
You know, I think ...

17:40.974 --> 17:42.892
Trey might have hooked up
with that blonde girl from I.U.

17:42.892 --> 17:44.644
I saw them dancing
by the pool last night.

17:44.644 --> 17:45.895
Know what time?

17:46.729 --> 17:47.480
I don't know.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.023
Last night was pretty
much a blur,

17:49.023 --> 17:49.774
if you know what I mean.

17:49.774 --> 17:52.193
Maybe y'all's clothes from last
night can help clear that up.

17:52.193 --> 17:53.319
What?

17:53.319 --> 17:54.445
Look.

17:54.863 --> 17:56.239
Your friend is dead.

17:58.199 --> 17:59.617
Okay, now, what
we need are ...

17:59.617 --> 18:01.786
the clothes you had on the
last time you were with him.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.163
Let's go.

18:17.635 --> 18:20.096
The bruises on y'all's arms
look an awful lot like Trey's.

18:20.096 --> 18:22.307
Did you guys have a flinch
game that got out of hand?

18:22.307 --> 18:24.392
Is that how he ended up
at the bottom of the pool?

18:28.813 --> 18:29.898
Delko.

18:30.732 --> 18:32.525
Yeah.
How high?

18:33.276 --> 18:35.278
Okay.
Thanks.

18:35.695 --> 18:36.738
Is that tox?

18:36.738 --> 18:40.241
Trey Hanson's THC levels
were 200 nanograms per mil.

18:40.241 --> 18:42.118
Whoa.
That is out of control.

18:42.118 --> 18:44.746
Did you guys smoke
marijuana with Trey last night?

18:44.746 --> 18:46.748
Nah.
No. No.

18:46.956 --> 18:50.126
Then you won't mind if we
search the room for narcotics.

18:51.044 --> 18:52.253
Take a walk, boys.

18:52.253 --> 18:53.505
Go stand outside
with the officer.

19:09.103 --> 19:10.647
What's taking so long?

19:10.730 --> 19:12.357
Why?
You going somewhere?

19:12.357 --> 19:13.483
Lake Havasu next week.

19:13.483 --> 19:14.734
South Padre the week after that.

19:14.734 --> 19:15.902
I got a business to run.

19:16.194 --> 19:19.030
My videos are going to be a
national brand before I'm thirty.

19:19.864 --> 19:21.533
With all that travel ...

19:21.866 --> 19:24.285
when was the last time
you saw the dentist?

19:24.702 --> 19:26.538
Let's start with the
occlusal surfaces.

19:28.414 --> 19:29.499
W-what are you
talking about?

19:29.499 --> 19:30.416
This ...

19:30.416 --> 19:32.293
is your chance.

19:34.379 --> 19:35.964
Open wide.

19:43.972 --> 19:47.100
They told us her neck was
broken on the phone.

19:47.392 --> 19:49.102
I'm sorry about
your sister.

19:49.602 --> 19:51.688
I don't understand how
that could happen.

19:52.313 --> 19:53.565
Tiffany rides horses.

19:53.565 --> 19:54.816
She mucks stalls.

19:54.816 --> 19:58.194
I-I've seen her get thrown
and pop right back up again.

19:58.194 --> 19:59.612
She's such a strong girl.

19:59.612 --> 20:00.864
Yeah?

20:00.864 --> 20:01.990
Was.

20:03.032 --> 20:05.326
She was so excited
for this trip.

20:05.535 --> 20:08.204
She worked all Christmas
just to pay for it.

20:09.122 --> 20:10.874
Who would do this
to her?

20:10.874 --> 20:11.958
Well ...

20:12.375 --> 20:13.793
we're working on that.

20:14.752 --> 20:16.004
But here's what
I want you to do.

20:16.004 --> 20:17.130
This is my cell phone number.

20:17.130 --> 20:20.049
If you need to talk,
you call me, day or night.

20:20.049 --> 20:21.259
All right?
Thank you.

20:21.259 --> 20:22.927
All right.
Hang in there.

20:23.469 --> 20:24.804
Lieutenant?
Yeah?

20:25.847 --> 20:27.724
When can I take
Tiffie home?

20:27.724 --> 20:29.517
We can't release
her to you ...

20:29.517 --> 20:30.768
until we're finished,

20:30.768 --> 20:32.854
but as soon as we can,
I'll let you know.

20:33.271 --> 20:34.314
All right.

21:23.571 --> 21:24.572
Are you sure about this?

21:24.572 --> 21:26.366
There aren't enough
concordant points ...

21:26.366 --> 21:29.202
to match Carson Mackie's
teeth to your victim's bites.

21:29.953 --> 21:31.621
But what about
these premolars?

21:31.621 --> 21:34.415
Some similarity in the
interproximal surfaces, yes,

21:34.415 --> 21:36.459
but that could be any
one of a million guys.

21:36.459 --> 21:38.545
Okay, Jon, this guy stinks.

21:38.545 --> 21:39.879
May be, Horatio,

21:39.879 --> 21:42.298
but the courts only care
how the evidence smells.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.343
... thank you.

21:49.639 --> 21:50.682
Nope.

21:52.559 --> 21:54.477
I told you I didn't
kill that girl.

21:56.563 --> 21:57.772
Now, where do I
go to sign out?

21:57.772 --> 21:58.731
I got a business
to get back to.

21:58.731 --> 21:59.941
Your business ...

21:59.941 --> 22:02.235
just got a whole lot
harder to run, so sit down.

22:02.235 --> 22:03.069
What?!

22:03.069 --> 22:06.239
Abuse of a dead body
is a second-degree felony.

22:06.239 --> 22:10.160
You're about to inherit
a jacket for necrophilia.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.411
Not only that,

22:11.411 --> 22:13.413
we're going to let every
law enforcement agency ...

22:13.413 --> 22:14.455
in Florida know about it.

22:15.373 --> 22:17.041
So, every town
you roll into,

22:17.041 --> 22:18.918
every time you
set up shop,

22:18.918 --> 22:21.296
the law's going to be
looking over your shoulder,

22:21.296 --> 22:23.173
chasing away
the babes.

22:23.173 --> 22:27.051
So why don't you put
that in your video?

22:28.553 --> 22:29.512
Hey...

22:29.512 --> 22:30.972
you ought
to check this out.

22:30.972 --> 22:32.056
Okay.

22:35.393 --> 22:37.395
Tyler here's been working
on a new database.

22:37.395 --> 22:38.146
Okay.

22:38.146 --> 22:40.857
I'm still beta-testing,
but it's pretty accurate.

22:40.857 --> 22:42.650
We ran with what
you started.

22:42.650 --> 22:45.028
Scanned every sexual
assault/murder ...

22:45.028 --> 22:46.321
in Florida in the
last three years.

22:46.321 --> 22:47.280
Then we cross-referenced,

22:47.280 --> 22:49.616
kept only the ones that
occurred on the beach.

22:49.616 --> 22:51.826
Then we eliminated
every one but ...

22:51.826 --> 22:53.244
the biters and
the broken necks.

22:53.244 --> 22:54.787
Left us with
three cases.

22:55.121 --> 22:58.583
Daytona, Panama City,
Key West,

22:58.791 --> 23:00.168
and now Miami.

23:00.168 --> 23:02.003
All spring break
destinations ...

23:02.003 --> 23:03.963
where the girls are
most vulnerable.

23:03.963 --> 23:05.590
This guy's calculating.

23:05.590 --> 23:07.425
Yes, he is, and he has
plenty of opportunity ...

23:07.425 --> 23:09.511
because we've got
two weeks left to go.

23:10.178 --> 23:11.304
Hang on a second.

23:11.513 --> 23:12.555
Yeah.

23:16.768 --> 23:17.852
Okay.

23:18.895 --> 23:20.104
That was beach patrol.

23:20.104 --> 23:21.272
We have another victim.

23:21.564 --> 23:22.565
They notify M.E.?

23:22.565 --> 23:26.110
That would be premature.
This one's still alive.

23:38.246 --> 23:39.122
Is this her over here?

23:39.122 --> 23:40.040
Yeah.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.541
Her name's Amy?

23:43.626 --> 23:44.753
Amy?

23:45.170 --> 23:47.422
I'm Horatio Caine.
I'm with the Crime Lab.

23:47.422 --> 23:49.466
You doing all right?
No.

23:49.466 --> 23:50.508
What happened?

23:52.594 --> 23:56.139
I was with all my friends at this
tequila party up by the hotel.

23:56.139 --> 23:58.016
And I guess I did
too many shots,

23:58.016 --> 23:59.976
'cause I felt like I was
going to heave,

23:59.976 --> 24:04.606
so I walked on the beach,
and I must've passed out.

24:04.606 --> 24:06.149
What happened after that?

24:06.691 --> 24:09.569
I thought I was
dreaming of sharks.

24:09.569 --> 24:12.614
I opened my eyes,
and this guy is biting me.

24:12.906 --> 24:14.407
So I yelled my
damn head off,

24:14.407 --> 24:15.742
and I kicked him
as hard as I could,

24:15.742 --> 24:18.912
and I must've connected,
because he ran away.

24:18.912 --> 24:20.288
Did you get a look at him?

24:20.288 --> 24:22.332
No, it was totally
dark out there.

24:22.332 --> 24:25.460
Plus, I was pretty drunk.

24:29.339 --> 24:30.423
Are those from him?

24:31.383 --> 24:33.510
Does this go in some
kind of record, or something?

24:33.510 --> 24:34.719
No.

24:34.719 --> 24:36.930
None that your parents
will ever see.

24:37.430 --> 24:38.807
Those are from
body shots.

24:51.152 --> 24:52.320
Did you know these guys?

24:54.114 --> 24:55.991
The whole idea
of spring break is ...

24:55.991 --> 24:57.492
to meet new people.

24:57.492 --> 25:00.036
Do you think one of those
guys was my attacker?

25:01.079 --> 25:01.830
I don't know.

25:01.830 --> 25:03.498
Do you have any
other bite marks?

25:07.335 --> 25:08.712
He was so freaky.

25:09.129 --> 25:11.673
Amy, listen to me.
I know this is difficult.

25:11.673 --> 25:14.467
But you see, teeth marks
are like a fingerprint,

25:14.467 --> 25:17.721
and it could really
help me go after this guy.

25:17.929 --> 25:18.972
You understand?

25:25.103 --> 25:27.814
Okay.
You can cover those.

25:31.609 --> 25:33.903
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

25:36.948 --> 25:37.991
I know.

25:40.076 --> 25:41.202
I know.

25:41.328 --> 25:42.746
You're safe now, Amy.

25:42.746 --> 25:45.874
You're safe, now.
You're safe.

26:49.521 --> 26:50.689
Four on a bong?

26:51.731 --> 26:53.733
DNA'll be able to
answer that.

26:54.150 --> 26:57.278
Maybe trace can tell us
what these white flecks are.

27:00.532 --> 27:03.034
I'll call Bernstein and tell
him to let the boys back in.

27:09.165 --> 27:10.792
Madraca tequila!

27:11.084 --> 27:12.293
Right here!

27:12.293 --> 27:14.295
All you can swallow!

27:14.295 --> 27:17.424
Madraca,
the only tequila!

27:21.803 --> 27:22.929
How's Amy?

27:23.346 --> 27:24.639
She's shaken up.

27:25.223 --> 27:26.224
She's shaken up.

27:26.224 --> 27:28.435
A SART nurse just took
her to the ER.

27:28.977 --> 27:30.770
Did you get anything
off her bites?

27:31.479 --> 27:32.564
No.
You know how that is.

27:32.564 --> 27:33.982
You know how
bruises are.

27:33.982 --> 27:35.358
Blood rushes to the bites,

27:35.358 --> 27:36.860
swallows them,
diffuses them;

27:36.860 --> 27:37.610
you can't get a match.

27:37.610 --> 27:39.154
We're back to square one.

27:39.988 --> 27:41.865
Well, maybe not.

27:41.865 --> 27:43.074
Check this out.

27:43.700 --> 27:44.909
It's a memory stick.

27:44.909 --> 27:47.329
Plugs into one of those
digital camcorders.

27:47.829 --> 27:50.290
See all these yahoos
shooting video all day?

27:52.292 --> 27:54.586
Our attacker could be
on that, couldn't he?

27:55.128 --> 27:56.296
Let's take a look at it.

27:56.296 --> 27:57.422
Nice going.

28:00.050 --> 28:01.885
Hey, DNA just paged me.

28:01.885 --> 28:04.637
Found all four guys on the
mouthpiece of that bong.

28:05.263 --> 28:06.264
I'm not surprised;

28:06.264 --> 28:07.474
it seemed like they
were lying.

28:07.474 --> 28:09.559
What about the white
specks in the bong chamber?

28:09.559 --> 28:12.562
High pleghm content
and traces of HCl.

28:12.562 --> 28:13.938
Stomach acid.

28:13.938 --> 28:15.190
Who threw up?

28:15.190 --> 28:18.193
Well, the vomit matches
our dead body, Trey.

28:18.193 --> 28:20.403
Probably a symptom
of his aneurysm.

28:20.403 --> 28:22.781
Or, the aneurysm is the
result of a trauma.

28:23.114 --> 28:24.407
You up for a dog
and pony show?

28:24.407 --> 28:25.617
Absolutely.

28:25.700 --> 28:27.077
Okay, this is what we know:

28:27.077 --> 28:28.662
Y'all were smoking out
of the bong,

28:28.662 --> 28:30.330
your friend Trey got
very stoned,

28:30.330 --> 28:31.998
he vomited,
and then he died.

28:31.998 --> 28:33.458
So the question is, guys,

28:33.458 --> 28:35.001
did somebody force
him to smoke?

28:35.001 --> 28:36.795
We didn't force him
to do anything.

28:36.795 --> 28:38.880
So, how do explain
the THC levels?

28:39.714 --> 28:41.883
Bong olympics.
Say again?

28:41.883 --> 28:42.759
Uh, it's a game.

28:42.759 --> 28:43.885
Oh, you mean like
punching each other?

28:43.885 --> 28:45.470
You see how much
weed you can smoke?

28:45.470 --> 28:47.263
No, not how much,
how long.

28:48.932 --> 28:50.684
All right, the first
one to exhale ...

28:50.684 --> 28:52.227
buys a round tonight.

28:57.649 --> 28:59.401
You're up, man.

29:00.443 --> 29:02.529
Come on, dude!
Come on, dude!

29:08.660 --> 29:10.245
Trey got sick, so ...

29:10.245 --> 29:11.788
we went swimming
to clear his head,

29:11.788 --> 29:13.123
make him feel better.

29:13.123 --> 29:14.958
So, you admit you went
with him to the pool.

29:14.958 --> 29:17.168
Actually, we ...
we took a shortcut.

29:22.465 --> 29:24.801
Okay, so the four of
you left the hotel room.

29:24.801 --> 29:26.386
You walked upstairs
to the roof,

29:26.386 --> 29:28.054
and then you
jumped off the roof.

29:28.304 --> 29:29.472
Yeah.

29:30.515 --> 29:32.934
Hundreds of people saw
us, just ask anyone.

29:32.934 --> 29:34.477
Well, that's convenient.

29:35.103 --> 29:36.688
Okay.
Sit tight.

29:42.027 --> 29:44.029
Memory stick you guys
found was pretty dinged up.

29:44.029 --> 29:47.282
I had to run a few recovery
utilities just to get this.

29:47.824 --> 29:49.492
Come on, Amy, go for it.

29:49.492 --> 29:52.329
There's Amy, the girl that
was attacked last night.

29:52.329 --> 29:54.581
This looks like something
Carson Mackie shot,

29:54.581 --> 29:55.832
or one of his
cameramen.

29:55.832 --> 29:57.625
I didn't do anything.

29:57.625 --> 29:58.877
Totally showed your thong.

29:58.877 --> 30:00.837
Shut up!
You are so dead!

30:01.379 --> 30:02.672
Wait a second.
What was that?

30:04.674 --> 30:06.509
Shut up!
You are so dead!

30:07.552 --> 30:08.345
Stop-and-start.

30:08.345 --> 30:09.888
Just a flicker
between takes.

30:09.888 --> 30:11.306
Can we slow that down?

30:11.306 --> 30:12.557
Yeah.

30:16.186 --> 30:19.105
That's Tiffany.
Can we see more of her?

30:19.105 --> 30:21.524
There should be a residual
charge stored on the capacitor.

30:21.524 --> 30:23.735
We could get lucky.

30:31.242 --> 30:32.952
I'm not going to
show you that, okay?

30:32.952 --> 30:34.120
I'm a good girl.

30:34.120 --> 30:36.081
This had to be
recorded last week.

30:37.123 --> 30:38.500
That's Carson's voice.

30:38.500 --> 30:41.211
He's bird-dogging somebody
else without realizing it.

30:41.211 --> 30:42.087
Look at her eye-line.

30:42.087 --> 30:44.297
You said you'd do it.
I'm holding you to it.

30:46.299 --> 30:49.260
All right, but I'm only
doing this for a free shirt.

30:49.260 --> 30:50.887
She never looks
at the camera.

30:51.012 --> 30:52.555
No. And that's because
this is ...

30:52.555 --> 30:54.641
not Carson's crew,
it's our killer.

30:55.141 --> 30:57.102
Here you go.
There's your shirt.

30:57.602 --> 30:59.479
Say good-bye.
And we're looking right ...

30:59.479 --> 31:00.939
through his eyes.

31:01.648 --> 31:02.816
Good-bye.

31:03.024 --> 31:04.776
I'm sorry, mom and dad.

31:21.416 --> 31:24.544
Okay, so they said the four of
them walked across the roof,

31:24.544 --> 31:25.629
which got me thinking:

31:25.629 --> 31:27.714
Motel roofs are tar
and gravel.

31:28.423 --> 31:30.175
He's got the
scratches to prove it.

31:30.175 --> 31:31.593
On the tops of his feet.

31:31.593 --> 31:33.637
And there is only one
way that happened.

31:33.637 --> 31:34.804
He was dragged.

31:36.473 --> 31:37.641
Up the stairs...

31:38.141 --> 31:39.476
... and onto the roof.

31:42.187 --> 31:43.772
His swimming trunks
were on backwards ...

31:43.772 --> 31:45.273
and it wasn't
because he was stoned.

31:45.273 --> 31:46.858
It was a re-dress.

31:58.370 --> 31:59.704
He died in his room.

32:00.205 --> 32:01.665
He died in their room.

32:09.464 --> 32:13.218
These are your friend's
autopsy pictures.

32:18.390 --> 32:20.350
You guys crazy,
showing us this?

32:20.350 --> 32:21.601
Well, we figured if ...

32:21.601 --> 32:23.103
you guys weren't going
to tell us the truth,

32:23.103 --> 32:25.021
we'd bring in someone
who would.

32:26.064 --> 32:27.858
Is this some kind
of sick joke?

32:27.858 --> 32:29.276
No, not at all.

32:29.276 --> 32:32.112
Trey's body tells us that he was
dead before he hit the water.

32:32.112 --> 32:33.738
So, we're thinking ...

32:33.738 --> 32:35.282
maybe your motel room.

32:35.407 --> 32:37.617
Eventually, he's going
to tell us the truth.

32:38.034 --> 32:40.203
Unless one of you
wants to tell us first.

32:43.039 --> 32:43.832
He just collapsed.

32:43.832 --> 32:45.333
We didn't know what to do.
Shut up, Matt!

32:45.333 --> 32:46.710
They figured it out!

32:51.882 --> 32:53.508
He was on my team.

32:54.885 --> 32:56.636
We were down two minutes.

32:57.053 --> 32:58.847
I didn't want to lose.

32:58.847 --> 33:00.140
What do you mean, your team?

33:00.140 --> 33:01.558
It's another competition.

33:02.392 --> 33:03.685
He couldn't hold his stuff.

33:04.519 --> 33:06.062
So, I...
I helped him.

33:12.736 --> 33:15.113
Holding his breath like that
is what caused the aneurysm.

33:19.784 --> 33:20.994
Oh, my god!
He's dead!

33:20.994 --> 33:23.079
Don't freak out!
Don't freak out!

33:23.079 --> 33:24.414
What do we do, man?!

33:24.414 --> 33:25.207
I got a plan.

33:25.207 --> 33:26.917
All right, guys?
I got a plan.

33:27.626 --> 33:28.668
Drag him over.

33:33.924 --> 33:36.510
Make it look real.
Are y'all ready?

33:36.510 --> 33:37.552
Let's go.

33:52.776 --> 33:54.861
No one noticed that Trey
didn't came back up.

33:55.403 --> 33:58.365
So you passed him off for alive
when he was already dead.

33:58.365 --> 34:00.367
Matt, why didn't
you call 911?

34:01.827 --> 34:03.578
I didn't want to get
in trouble.

34:06.998 --> 34:08.208
What's going to
happen to Matt?

34:08.208 --> 34:10.293
The same thing that's going
to happen to the two of you.

34:10.293 --> 34:12.003
What?
W-we didn't do anything.

34:12.003 --> 34:14.714
You're both accomplices
to a homicide.

34:14.714 --> 34:17.175
Involuntary manslaughter,
negligent homicide.

34:17.175 --> 34:19.553
That's for the state's
attorney to decide.

34:19.969 --> 34:21.847
The sad thing is that
you could've called 911,

34:21.847 --> 34:23.598
if you wouldn't have
been so stoned.

34:23.889 --> 34:25.851
You might've saved
a friend's life ...

34:26.893 --> 34:28.978
instead of making a
wreck of your own.

34:33.065 --> 34:36.152
There's your shirt.
Say good-bye.

34:36.152 --> 34:37.237
Good-bye.

34:37.654 --> 34:39.739
I'm sorry, mom and dad.

34:48.456 --> 34:50.000
I'm sorry, mom and dad.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.208
Lieutenant?

34:52.252 --> 34:53.545
Come here a second.

34:53.545 --> 34:56.464
Tell me if this guy just
cleaned his lens.

34:59.009 --> 35:00.093
Or ...

35:00.302 --> 35:02.220
he's giving us
the finger.

35:02.220 --> 35:03.180
Yeah, but you know
what they say:

35:03.180 --> 35:05.307
You point a finger, there's
three pointing back at you.

35:05.307 --> 35:07.475
Let's run this through
video enhancement ...

35:07.475 --> 35:10.187
and bring up the
ridge detail, okay?

35:27.204 --> 35:29.831
Bet you there are a thousand
other guys out there with cameras.

35:30.582 --> 35:31.791
That may be true.

35:32.834 --> 35:34.586
But you're the only one
with parking tickets ...

35:34.586 --> 35:38.298
in the same location and date
as each of our victims, Mr. Miller.

35:38.298 --> 35:39.257
Coincidence.

35:39.257 --> 35:40.800
Coincidence, maybe.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.719
But it is going to be
hard for you to explain ...

35:42.719 --> 35:45.347
away your teeth marks
on Tiffany Heitzenrader.

35:45.388 --> 35:46.223
Never met her.

35:46.223 --> 35:48.433
You just keep telling
yourself that, my friend.

36:23.343 --> 36:24.302
Hey.

36:24.302 --> 36:26.012
Heard you're looking for me.
Yeah.

36:26.012 --> 36:27.931
These bite marks we
got from Tiffany,

36:27.931 --> 36:30.517
they don't match our
suspect, Kip Miller,

36:30.517 --> 36:32.269
Is there any way
to get better definition?

36:32.269 --> 36:34.020
Maybe excise
the wound track?

36:34.020 --> 36:37.399
Markings on dead
flesh degrade, you know that.

36:37.399 --> 36:39.150
They're probably in
worse shape now ...

36:39.150 --> 36:40.193
than they were at
her autopsy.

36:40.193 --> 36:43.363
Dead flesh, but what
about living, Alexx?

36:43.363 --> 36:44.865
What about living?

36:48.410 --> 36:50.245
Anything I could do to help.

36:50.245 --> 36:53.081
I swear, I already told you
everything I remember, okay?

36:53.707 --> 36:54.499
Amy?

36:54.499 --> 36:55.625
You said my bite
marks couldn't help.

36:55.625 --> 36:56.793
What's changed all
of a sudden?

36:56.793 --> 36:58.295
Actually, it's not
all of a sudden.

36:58.295 --> 36:59.796
The blood from
the bruising ...

36:59.796 --> 37:01.756
is absorbed back into
the skin over time.

37:03.091 --> 37:05.594
Giving us a greater
definition of the bite mark.

37:06.428 --> 37:07.596
"Teeth are like
fingerprints".

37:07.596 --> 37:08.638
I know.

37:09.598 --> 37:11.141
I can't.
I'm sorry.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.809
I just want to go
back home ...

37:12.809 --> 37:14.060
and pretend none of this
ever happened to me.

37:14.060 --> 37:15.270
And that's
understandable.

37:17.355 --> 37:18.607
You think I'm awful.

37:18.607 --> 37:19.733
No, I don't.

37:20.442 --> 37:23.069
I think you're a human being
and that's okay.

37:25.155 --> 37:26.823
You don't look like it's okay.

37:27.741 --> 37:29.326
Here's the problem.

37:29.326 --> 37:31.328
You're the only one who
stands between this guy ...

37:31.328 --> 37:33.705
and his next victim and
you're leaving.

37:34.748 --> 37:36.625
Do you see why
that's a problem?

37:42.547 --> 37:45.675
Why'd you have to be so nice to
me out on the beach last night?

37:48.386 --> 37:49.179
Okay.

37:49.179 --> 37:51.014
Take those bags out
of there, please.

37:51.848 --> 37:53.642
Ready?

37:56.770 --> 37:57.812
All right.

38:33.056 --> 38:34.182
Horatio.

38:37.102 --> 38:38.103
"Inconclusive"?

38:38.103 --> 38:39.354
Afraid so.

38:39.354 --> 38:41.356
You got more points of
concordance than before,

38:41.356 --> 38:42.983
but the bottom
line is,

38:42.983 --> 38:44.234
it's Carson Mackie
all over again.

38:44.234 --> 38:45.443
No, wait a second.
Hold on a second.

38:45.443 --> 38:47.487
This is dissonance.
Does he wear crowns?

38:47.487 --> 38:49.156
Doesn't present that way.

38:49.156 --> 38:51.241
And temps would've come off
when we took his impressions.

38:51.241 --> 38:53.994
Unless he's been doing a
little in-home dentistry.

38:53.994 --> 38:55.912
Let's find out.
Thank you.

38:56.955 --> 38:57.998
Stand up, Kip.

39:00.125 --> 39:01.168
Stand up.

39:05.005 --> 39:06.923
Oh, you're going to have
to let me go, aren't you?

39:07.966 --> 39:09.384
Not yet.

39:09.926 --> 39:11.052
Smile for me.

39:11.052 --> 39:11.845
What?

39:11.845 --> 39:13.096
Smile.

39:14.139 --> 39:15.765
Aah.
You have an overbite.

39:16.516 --> 39:17.601
You wear crowns?

39:17.601 --> 39:18.768
No.

39:19.060 --> 39:21.688
No?
See, I think you do.

39:21.813 --> 39:24.983
I think that you wear
temporary crowns ...

39:24.983 --> 39:29.154
on your upper right
cuspid and bicuspid.

39:29.696 --> 39:30.864
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:30.864 --> 39:31.781
No?

39:31.781 --> 39:35.619
Do you take them
out before each attack?

39:46.713 --> 39:49.883
Did you put them back
with dental cement ...

39:49.883 --> 39:51.968
when the police
got on to you?

39:59.893 --> 40:01.978
Okay.
Smile for me again.

40:06.399 --> 40:07.984
Let me give you
a little help.

40:13.865 --> 40:14.908
Oops.

40:18.578 --> 40:19.621
Now it matches.

40:21.748 --> 40:24.543
You're under arrest for the
sexual assault of Amy Gorman.

40:24.543 --> 40:25.710
Get him out of here.

40:25.710 --> 40:26.962
Gladly.

40:29.047 --> 40:30.465
Get up!

40:33.593 --> 40:34.636
Take care.

40:39.683 --> 40:40.851
Good crowns.

40:40.851 --> 40:42.143
Precision attachments.

40:42.143 --> 40:44.145
Explains why we
didn't see them.

40:44.145 --> 40:45.730
I wish we could've gotten
him on Tiffany ...

40:45.730 --> 40:46.565
and those other murders.

40:46.565 --> 40:49.151
The important thing right
now is that he's behind bars.

40:49.151 --> 40:50.861
Fools like him, he's going
to be giving it away.

40:50.861 --> 40:52.988
He'll forget about us,
about forensics,

40:52.988 --> 40:55.282
and the most important
thing about Miami.

40:55.282 --> 40:57.868
Which is?
We never close.

41:14.050 --> 41:15.093
Bikini.
