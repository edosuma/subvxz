WEBVTT

01:31.425 --> 01:34.428
That's a beautiful pig.

01:34.511 --> 01:38.140
Only the best, Father.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.184
This way, Father.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.457
The boy is showing

02:03.540 --> 02:06.668
all the classical signs of possession,
Father Amorth.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.755
Has the family consulted a doctor?

02:10.339 --> 02:12.966
Many, many doctors.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.137
What are the signs of possession?

02:17.721 --> 02:19.139
He converses in English, Father.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.226
Has he spoken English before?

02:23.310 --> 02:25.187
Never. Not once before.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.190
Do they own a television?

02:28.940 --> 02:30.150
Yes, I believe so.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.487
Okay, thank you.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.203
Ah...

02:41.286 --> 02:43.330
What are you drawing?

02:43.413 --> 02:44.623
A bird.

02:46.666 --> 02:50.545
That's good, kid.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.717
I have a very important job for you.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.555
Do you know the Our Father?

03:01.139 --> 03:03.600
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.648
You can help your brother.

03:09.731 --> 03:15.821
Repeat the Our Father, over and over.

03:16.405 --> 03:21.410
Don't get distracted.
Relentless. Understood?

03:23.286 --> 03:24.663
Yes, Father.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.331
Good.

03:28.083 --> 03:34.423
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

03:39.219 --> 03:40.846
Bring me the pig.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.329
I am legion.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.500
I am Satan.

04:13.253 --> 04:17.090
I am foul-mouthed behemoth.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.635
Difficult to believe.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.890
You doubt me?

04:24.973 --> 04:28.685
If you are Satan, what is my name?

04:31.438 --> 04:33.148
Describe hell.

04:35.650 --> 04:39.112
You will find out soon enough.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.948
Are you avoiding my questions?

04:42.032 --> 04:43.158
You mock me?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.959
Answer me, Satan.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.924
Why possess this boy?

04:59.007 --> 05:01.551
Why not someone more influential?

05:01.635 --> 05:06.431
I can possess anyone I choose.

05:06.848 --> 05:07.682
Ah.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.394
Could you possess Father Gianni?

05:12.479 --> 05:13.605
A bishop?

05:13.688 --> 05:16.483
Anyone! Anything!

05:16.566 --> 05:18.068
I do not believe you.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.571
I don't believe
you could even possess this pig.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.699
Can you do it? You have the power.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.535
Could you possess the pig?

05:26.618 --> 05:28.245
- Yes, I can.
- Come on, Satan.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.162
Watch me!

05:29.246 --> 05:32.207
Possess the pig.
Show me you are the Prince of Darkness.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.335
Show to me your power.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.419
Have you done it?

05:36.503 --> 05:38.380
Have you possessed him, Satan?

05:40.298 --> 05:42.217
Have you possessed it, Satan?

05:53.478 --> 05:54.646
Be calm.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.942
God blesses you.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.694
You can sleep now, my son.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.612
The demon has gone.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.287

06:38.189 --> 06:40.483

07:06.009 --> 07:09.554
Amy, we're not in America anymore.
You can't dress like that.

07:11.056 --> 07:11.890
Why?

07:11.973 --> 07:14.601
Because there's gonna be
construction workers everywhere.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.980
How you doing back there?

07:19.689 --> 07:23.652
<i>♪ The world and the world... ♪</i>

07:50.553 --> 07:53.223

07:53.306 --> 07:55.225
Amy, please. Don't start.

07:55.308 --> 07:59.187
- You know exactly what I'm gonna say.
- Yes, and I don't wanna hear it.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.982
What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?

08:05.610 --> 08:06.903
Yeah, I know.

08:16.830 --> 08:17.706
Cuckoo!

08:25.255 --> 08:27.507
Ah... Gabriele.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.762
Why do you think Saint Michael

08:32.846 --> 08:35.515
didn't kill Satan when he had the chance?

08:36.182 --> 08:38.893
That is a question of theology.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.355
No shit.

08:42.439 --> 08:46.735
Perhaps it was his mercy
that stayed Saint Michael's sword.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.404
The only thing that arrests God's love

08:50.155 --> 08:52.449
is a person's freedom to choose.

08:53.074 --> 08:57.996
But God cannot be God
unless he allows for this choice

08:58.079 --> 08:59.706
even for the damned.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.833
Saint Michael, he knows this.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.129
We will all be judged.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.630
We will all be judged

09:08.423 --> 09:10.216
by how much we love.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.426
Hm.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.470
Do not worry, Gabriele.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.890
I will defend you.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.141
Defend me?

09:18.224 --> 09:19.476
Mm.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.479
My faith

09:23.229 --> 09:24.981
does not require defense.

09:31.029 --> 09:31.946
Oh-ho!

09:33.031 --> 09:34.157
Wow.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.076
- What do you think, guys?
- Cozy.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.538
Oh, come on.
Give it a chance. This is awesome.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.000
- Señora Vasquez.
- Carlos, hi!

09:44.083 --> 09:45.794
So nice to put a face to the voice.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.337
Um...

09:47.796 --> 09:50.215
<i>Padre--</i> Father Esquibel...

09:50.298 --> 09:52.926
- Pleasure to meet you, Miss Vasquez.
- Uh, Julia, please.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.595
- Carlos was giving me a tour.
- Oh, great.

09:55.678 --> 09:59.098
I just wanted to stop by and welcome
you and your family to the diocese.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.476
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no, please. Go for it.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.353
I'm glad to see you made it safe.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.814
All right. Go find your room, twerp.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.988
Hey. Can I get one of those?

10:14.072 --> 10:15.240
Yes, of course.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.575
This property has been in disrepair

10:17.659 --> 10:19.452
- for as long as I can remember.
- Thank you.

10:19.536 --> 10:23.206
So it's a wonderful thing you're doing,
restoring the abbey.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.959
We are being very respectful
of the existing architecture.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.920
This has actually been
in my husband's family for generations,

10:29.003 --> 10:30.547
and we just inherited it.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.632
Is Mr. Vasquez here or--?

10:32.715 --> 10:36.386
Oh, uh, he passed, actually.
About a year ago.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.638
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- It's okay.

10:38.721 --> 10:42.392
If you need anything,
please, hm, don't hesitate.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.351
Okay.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.687
I will remember him in my prayers.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.565
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Thank you. It was nice to meet you.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.401
Okay, Carlos, talk to me.
What's up? Where are we at?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.611
The basement excavation
is very complicated.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.988
More expensive, you mean?

10:55.071 --> 10:56.739
- I'm afraid so.
- All right.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.241
I'll take another look at the plans.

10:58.324 --> 11:01.202
If you could just show me what the
basement looks like, maybe I can wire--

11:01.286 --> 11:04.414
Amy, get off of there
before you break your neck.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.417
Is that a cigarette?
Put that out right now, please.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.085
- Fine.
- No! Oh, my God.

11:45.872 --> 11:46.789
Cute.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.499

13:24.762 --> 13:25.596
Amy.

13:30.810 --> 13:36.107
Look, I really can't handle
the silent treatment from both my kids.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.194
- I know you don't wanna be here.
- Yeah, no shit.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.112
Amy.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.699
Please, I need your help.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.826
This abbey is the only thing
your dad left us.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.453
We don't have an income anymore.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.873
Once we fix it up and sell it,
we'll go home. Okay?

13:52.999 --> 13:55.626
Maybe if you could just
at least watch your brother.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.211
Maybe try and get him to talk.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.839
How? He hasn't spoken in almost a year.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.300
Can you try for me?

14:02.383 --> 14:04.302
So you want me to be a mother for you?

14:04.385 --> 14:07.263
Please just keep an eye
on your brother. Okay?

14:40.630 --> 14:43.925
Father Amorth, caffe latte?

14:44.008 --> 14:47.303
At this time of the day? Are you crazy?

14:49.222 --> 14:51.557
Double espresso, Sister.

14:51.641 --> 14:52.809
Thank you.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.102
Sugar?

14:54.185 --> 14:57.522
Sugar is the work of the devil.
No, thank you.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.944
Thank you very much.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.449
Let's get on with this already.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.786
This is a formal hearing.

15:11.869 --> 15:15.039
And as agreed,
proceedings will be undertaken in English.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.917
Ah. All right, let's go.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.837
On the night of June 4th,
in the town of Tropea,

15:21.420 --> 15:23.172
you performed an exorcism

15:23.256 --> 15:26.717
without the approval
of the Reggio Calabria bishop.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.678
It wasn't a--

15:28.761 --> 15:30.304
In English, Father Amorth.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.184
That was not an exorcism.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.938
From Father Gianni's description,
what occurred in Reggio Calabria sounded

15:39.021 --> 15:42.942
exactly like an exorcism,
complete with animal sacrifice, no less.

15:43.025 --> 15:46.070
The boy was maladjusted.
A temporary mental illness.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.865
I use primitive psychology.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.117
The power of suggestion.

15:51.200 --> 15:55.580
You addressed the subject as Satan,
called for him to display his power.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.291
- Do you deny this?
- No.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.669
- That's what I did.
- And why would you do that?

16:01.752 --> 16:03.462
Exorcism is my job,

16:04.005 --> 16:07.091
but the vast majority of the cases
to which I'm assigned

16:07.175 --> 16:09.927
do not require an exorcism.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.389
They just need, uh, a little conversation,

16:14.182 --> 16:16.017
a little understanding,

16:16.100 --> 16:17.518
and sometimes...

16:18.728 --> 16:19.937
a little theater.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.566
Cardinal Sullivan, in my observation,

16:24.108 --> 16:27.320
98% of the cases
that are assigned to Father Amorth

16:27.403 --> 16:30.323
are then further recommended by him

16:30.406 --> 16:32.783
to doctors and psychiatrists.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.327
And the other 2%?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.954
Ah, the other 2%.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.708
This is something
that has confounded all of science

16:40.791 --> 16:43.002
and all of medicine for a very long time.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.381
I call it...

16:48.716 --> 16:49.550
evil.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.970
Your Eminence,
with hundreds of successful exorcisms,

16:53.054 --> 16:57.558
- Father Amorth has been very effective--
- One moment, Bishop Lumumba.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.312
You do raise an interesting point, Amorth.

17:01.896 --> 17:04.982
You are not a doctor,
but these practices of yours

17:05.066 --> 17:07.109
could have damaging effects
on these people.

17:07.777 --> 17:08.778
You are right.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.947
I am not a doctor.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.866
I am not a psychologist.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.536
But I am a theologian, I am a lawyer,

17:17.620 --> 17:20.456
I am a journalist,
and I am a practical man.

17:20.957 --> 17:25.628
I was also a partisan in the war,
so I know a firing squad when I see one.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.383
So, what is this about?

17:30.466 --> 17:32.802
The Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith

17:32.885 --> 17:34.470
has recommended to this panel

17:34.971 --> 17:39.892
that the position of chief exorcist
be formally vacated.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.770
So, what you are saying
is that evil does not exist?

17:42.853 --> 17:45.773
The Church is under constant pressure
to sharpen her relevance.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.651
It's time we move past
these outdated beliefs.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.070
Explain to me please, Your Eminence.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.072
If evil does not exist,

17:53.656 --> 17:57.118
what, then, is the role of the Church?

17:58.744 --> 18:02.999
I think we all have to be careful of the
Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.335
Sounds to me
like they want us all out of a job.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.385
We have more questions for you,
Father Amorth.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.599
How is it that I am suddenly worthy

18:20.683 --> 18:23.311
of the time and attention
of all you powerful men?

18:24.020 --> 18:25.229
I ask you again...

18:26.522 --> 18:27.857
what is this about?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.275
Due process, Father.

18:29.358 --> 18:32.695
So this is not about the dead girl,
Rosaria Velendez,

18:32.778 --> 18:35.614
<i>that I write about
in</i> La Madre di Dio <i>magazine?</i>

18:35.698 --> 18:37.950
What is your due diligence
and process on this?

18:38.034 --> 18:41.037
- Please, cardinal.
- I warn you! I warn you! Father Amorth,

18:41.120 --> 18:42.830
show respect to your superiors.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.290
I do!

18:44.373 --> 18:46.792
I am the chief exorcist of the Vatican.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.795
My position was appointed by my bishop.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.672
My diocese is Rome.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.507
My local bishop is the pope.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.718
If you have a problem with me,

18:56.427 --> 18:58.471
you talk to my boss. Okay?

18:59.347 --> 19:01.390
The pope is infirm.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.392
Father Amorth,
you have not been dismissed.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.977
- Cuckoo.
- Father Amorth!

19:58.823 --> 19:59.657
Hello?

20:01.617 --> 20:02.660
Anyone there?

20:56.213 --> 20:58.632
I can't wait to finish this job.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.009
This place freaks me out.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.436
What is it?

21:13.022 --> 21:15.065
I don't know. Can't see anything.

21:38.672 --> 21:39.924
They hit a gas deposit.

21:40.508 --> 21:44.178
We can't continue working here.
I'm pulling my team from this place.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.348
Come on, let's go. Come on, everybody out.

21:47.431 --> 21:48.265
Wait.

21:49.808 --> 21:50.976
Quick, quick.

22:05.783 --> 22:06.617
Henry?

22:07.243 --> 22:08.661
No. Henry!

22:09.954 --> 22:10.829
Mom!

22:12.289 --> 22:15.209
Oh, my God!
Henry! What is happening?

22:15.292 --> 22:17.211
I don't know,
he was like this when I came in.

22:17.294 --> 22:19.630
Henry? Henry, it's Mommy.

22:19.713 --> 22:20.589
Talk to me.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.926
- Henry.
- Mommy.

22:24.009 --> 22:24.927
He's talking.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.930
- Henry.
- Mommy.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.771
You're all going to die.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.315
Henry! What are you doing?

22:38.399 --> 22:39.733
- Henry! Henry!
- Henry! Henry!

22:51.161 --> 22:53.622
<i>X-rays, blood tests, even the spinal tap</i>

22:53.706 --> 22:56.584
and MRI show no results
of ischemia or hematoma.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.460
What does that mean?

23:02.423 --> 23:06.677
All of his vitals
and brain functions seem to be normal.

23:06.760 --> 23:10.431
Wait, normal? What do you mean?
He was convulsing.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.977
Has he been through any trauma recently?

23:18.022 --> 23:19.523
Um...

23:20.608 --> 23:24.403
Yeah, uh, his dad died about a year ago.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.074
And how did he react?

23:30.117 --> 23:31.118
Uh...

23:31.201 --> 23:32.745
He hasn't spoken since.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.126
Wha-- Psychosis?

23:39.209 --> 23:41.253
No, that's not possible.
He's just a little boy.

23:41.337 --> 23:45.090
Ma'am,
there is nothing that we can do now.

23:45.174 --> 23:48.594
- But he can recommend a good psychiatrist.
- What is this?

23:51.513 --> 23:54.183
If your son continues
trying to hurt himself,

23:54.266 --> 23:56.268
- you can administer him this sedative.
- No.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.145
- Mom.
- I'm so sorry.

23:58.812 --> 23:59.813
Baby.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.106
Oh, my God.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.199
No, I don't think you understand.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.285
But this is an emergency, please.

24:13.369 --> 24:18.499
No, I need to talk to someone
at the consulate who can help me.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.209
I need a specialist.

24:21.794 --> 24:22.628
Okay.

24:24.213 --> 24:25.172
Okay.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.257
Yes, please.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.613
Baby.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.284
Hey.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.621
My love, come here.

25:17.474 --> 25:18.392
Fuck this.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.109
Henry, no.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.610
Henry, stop!

25:28.694 --> 25:30.487
This baby's hungry, you fat cow.

25:30.571 --> 25:32.406
What? What are you saying?

25:32.489 --> 25:34.491
You never breastfed me, Mommy.

25:34.575 --> 25:35.701
- What?
- What the fuck?

25:35.784 --> 25:37.911
Ow!

25:41.707 --> 25:43.208
What the fuck is that?

25:43.292 --> 25:45.878
Bring me the priest.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.089
- Can you help us?
- Yes.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.508
I'm here to help, Julia.

25:51.592 --> 25:52.426
Okay.

26:07.983 --> 26:10.903
Wrong fucking priest!

26:27.544 --> 26:31.048
- Is that you, Gabriele?
- Yes, Holy Father.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.259
They tell me you are sick.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.595
Yes, they hope so.

26:37.471 --> 26:39.348
They wish to see me weak.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.433
But, no, they are.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.605
- Help me.
- Yes.

27:07.668 --> 27:11.213
Perhaps we've done our jobs too well.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.924
Cardinal Sullivan
and the younger generation,

27:14.007 --> 27:17.052
they don't believe in the devil
as we understand it.

27:17.803 --> 27:23.767
It's only an idea for them.
For us, it is very real.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.478
Two hundred fallen angels,

27:26.562 --> 27:30.107
expelled from heaven, driven beneath
the soil where God is not welcomed.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.110
It is not a fairytale.

27:34.236 --> 27:38.073
Your search for truth
is delightful, Gabriele,

27:38.156 --> 27:41.994
but pay attention
to your desire to educate.

27:42.077 --> 27:46.415
Pride manifests itself in different forms.

27:48.041 --> 27:50.419
Pride? Me?

27:53.922 --> 27:56.341
There's a case that needs your attention.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.427
A boy in Spain.

27:59.011 --> 28:03.265
Something about it disturbs me greatly.

28:05.851 --> 28:09.813
<i>This boy's possession
is progressing very fast.</i>

28:11.273 --> 28:14.568
<i>The incident took place
in hallowed ground,</i>

28:14.651 --> 28:17.404
<i>San Sebastian Abbey in Castile.</i>

28:19.865 --> 28:23.160
This place
has given the Church problems before.

28:24.244 --> 28:27.497
<i>I sense a great evil coming from there.</i>

28:28.040 --> 28:32.586
<i>Something dark
that only you can help solve.</i>

28:34.046 --> 28:37.883
<i>I have requested the abbey's records
be brought to you in the library.</i>

28:39.468 --> 28:40.427
<i>Look into it.</i>

28:41.845 --> 28:45.891
<i>I will continue investigating
while you're on your journey.</i>

28:50.854 --> 28:52.230
"Our sins...

28:53.649 --> 28:55.817
will seek us out."

28:57.069 --> 28:58.320
<i>Gabriele.</i>

28:58.403 --> 29:01.865
Go to Spain, and help this child.

29:02.491 --> 29:06.536
But be careful,
this demon sounds dangerous.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.302
Hello?

30:35.208 --> 30:36.251
Father.

30:37.294 --> 30:40.505
Good morning.
I'm Father Tomás Esquibel.

30:41.631 --> 30:42.841
- Spanish?
- Yes.

30:43.717 --> 30:46.428
I am Father Amorth. Italian.

30:48.305 --> 30:51.475
- Wait. Father Amorth?
- Yes.

30:52.059 --> 30:55.062
Ah. I didn't expect them to send you.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.146
You know me?

30:56.229 --> 31:00.400
Yes. I have read all the articles.

31:00.484 --> 31:03.361
- And the books?
- No, no. No, not the books.

31:04.780 --> 31:05.739
The books are good.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.742
- I will read--
- Okay. I'll just get my bag.

31:08.825 --> 31:11.036
You, uh... Whiskey?

31:11.912 --> 31:13.038
No, no, no. Thank you.

31:13.622 --> 31:16.750
Yeah, this sore throat, the dust.

31:20.462 --> 31:23.840
Julia, we have been extremely lucky.
The Church sent someone.

31:23.924 --> 31:26.593
An expert in these matters.
Gabriele, please come in.

31:28.261 --> 31:31.098
Good morning, good morning, good morning.

31:31.181 --> 31:32.140
I am Father Amorth.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.309
I have come from Roma.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.852
Gabriele, how are you?

31:37.187 --> 31:39.064
I'm sorry that you came all this way,

31:39.147 --> 31:41.817
but I don't even know
why the Church is interested in this.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.485
I just want my son to be well.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.402
Yes, yes.

31:44.486 --> 31:48.573
Tell me something,
have the doctors given you any answers?

31:49.074 --> 31:50.325
Any comfort?

31:50.992 --> 31:53.078
If you would at least...

31:54.287 --> 31:55.872
just let me see your son.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.293
I can give you my opinion
and you can do with it what you will.

32:05.632 --> 32:06.508
It's worth a shot.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.596
Okay. He's upstairs.

32:13.056 --> 32:15.642
Very nice, this.

32:17.686 --> 32:20.147
Hello, my friend.

32:38.165 --> 32:38.999
Henry.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.293
Are you awake?

33:39.142 --> 33:42.187
Our Father, who art in heaven,

33:42.270 --> 33:46.358
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be--

33:46.441 --> 33:49.361
Your prayers are worthless here.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.896
Who are you?

34:24.980 --> 34:29.651
Your worst fear. I am your demise.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.821
Why are you possessing this boy?

34:32.904 --> 34:37.742
Because it feels so good
to ruin such innocent flesh.

34:38.410 --> 34:42.205
But I prefer the challenge
of an exorcist's soul.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.582
You only serve to diminish yourself.

34:44.666 --> 34:47.002
Don't lecture me, priest.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.503
What is your purpose?

34:48.586 --> 34:50.547
I'm here for you.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.634
Then you must know my name.

34:55.260 --> 34:59.556
I know your soul and every shameless sin.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.059
Tell me one of my sins.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.397
You cannot.

35:08.857 --> 35:12.569
Because my sins have been absolved
by the one true master,

35:12.652 --> 35:14.654
- the Lord Jesus Christ.
- Do not speak of him.

35:14.738 --> 35:18.033
Are you afraid of him?
Are you afraid of Jesus Christ?

35:19.909 --> 35:22.287
God is not here.

35:22.996 --> 35:25.498
God is everywhere.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.709
Whatever you do...

35:28.877 --> 35:31.087
you only do because God allows it.

35:34.549 --> 35:35.967
Did he allow that?

35:36.885 --> 35:38.678
This is just the beginning.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.722
You don't know who you're dealing with.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.642
Then tell me. Tell me your name.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.728
Unless you are too afraid.

35:46.811 --> 35:51.107
I'm not some stupid fuck
you convince to get into a pig.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.777
So you won't tell me your name.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.238
My name is blasphemy.

35:57.989 --> 36:01.951
My name is nightmare.

36:03.203 --> 36:04.037
Ah.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.292
My nightmare...

36:10.460 --> 36:13.254
is France winning the World Cup.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.298
You prideful fool.

36:15.382 --> 36:18.259
You can't hide
behind your jokes forever...

36:19.677 --> 36:21.638
Gabriele.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.100
I know your nightmares too.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.791
Show yourself, coward.

36:52.502 --> 36:54.087
Show yourself.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.631
Coward.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.176
Show yourself, coward.

37:20.864 --> 37:24.492
Beware, your sins will seek you out.

37:27.620 --> 37:30.623
I'll be waiting for you, Gabe.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.670
Did you mention my name
to anyone in this house?

37:36.546 --> 37:37.630
Maybe, I'm not sure.

37:38.214 --> 37:42.886
This demon, it says things
that it could not know.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.014
So it's real?

37:47.056 --> 37:48.766
What do you know about demons?

37:50.518 --> 37:54.272
Only the basics,
that they are fallen angels.

37:54.856 --> 37:56.608
One serves the other in a hierarchy.

37:56.691 --> 37:57.567
Yes.

37:58.234 --> 38:02.489
The higher the demon,
the more access it can have.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.699
So why is it possessing the boy?

38:04.782 --> 38:08.369
This is a very good question.
I'm going to talk to the mother.

38:08.453 --> 38:11.289
I need to work out
why this demon has chosen Henry.

38:11.915 --> 38:16.711
What I am about to say may be difficult.
Confronting.

38:18.338 --> 38:23.635
Your son is under the influence
of a very powerful demon.

38:24.302 --> 38:27.138
Removing the boy
from this place could be fatal.

38:28.056 --> 38:29.599
I say to you now...

38:30.517 --> 38:35.647
the only way your son
comes back to you is through faith.

38:37.982 --> 38:41.361
Mrs. Vasquez,
did anything happen to Henry?

38:42.612 --> 38:45.198
He was in the car accident
that killed his father.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.868
He saw his father impaled.

38:53.289 --> 38:56.292
That memory, that's his demon.

38:57.210 --> 38:59.003
I give you my word,

38:59.587 --> 39:02.382
I will not walk away from you,
or your son.

39:05.051 --> 39:08.680
Trauma such as you describe
can be a gateway for the devil.

39:10.098 --> 39:14.394
Suffering can make a soul
desperate for connection.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.939
It can make the innocent more vulnerable.

39:22.944 --> 39:25.530
You must have loved your husband
very much.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.951
You have no idea.

39:31.536 --> 39:35.290
He was your soul connection, <i>sì?</i>

39:37.417 --> 39:38.876
He was everything.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.257
And you have two beautiful children.

39:46.134 --> 39:51.472
A mother's love is the closest thing
we know to God's love.

39:55.018 --> 39:56.227
Tell me, Julia.

39:59.188 --> 40:00.690
Have you ever believed?

40:02.650 --> 40:04.819
Uh, when I was a little girl...

40:06.863 --> 40:10.325
I used to think that
my guardian angel walked me to school.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.748
You should pray to that guardian angel.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.086
<i>♪ I'm stranded on my own ♪</i>

40:25.506 --> 40:28.217
<i>♪ Stranded far from home... ♪</i>

40:33.556 --> 40:34.599
Henry?

40:47.153 --> 40:47.987
Henry?

41:04.545 --> 41:05.963
Amy.

41:09.175 --> 41:11.010
I'm in hell.

41:26.901 --> 41:30.905
<i>Amy, honey, it's Dad.
You have to listen, okay?</i>

41:30.988 --> 41:32.031
Daddy?

41:32.115 --> 41:34.158
<i>You're all going to die.</i>

41:36.911 --> 41:38.788
Mom! Mom!

41:38.871 --> 41:40.915
Mom, it was Daddy. It was Dad.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.584
I heard Dad's voice.
I heard his voice on the phone.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.336
- He said that we're all gonna die.
- What?

41:45.420 --> 41:47.755
- He said that we were all gonna die.
- Oh, my God.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.427
Shh.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.344
What do we do?

41:55.388 --> 41:56.222
Coffee.

41:59.016 --> 42:02.145
The demons,
they grow more strongly in the night.

42:02.228 --> 42:05.815
I'm going to need my energy.
But you should try to get some rest.

42:07.316 --> 42:09.944
And may the souls
of all the faithful departed,

42:10.027 --> 42:13.781
through the mercy of God,
rest in peace.

42:13.865 --> 42:16.534
- Amen.
- How long will this take?

42:16.617 --> 42:18.035
That is hard to say.

42:18.119 --> 42:19.078
Hours.

42:20.163 --> 42:21.622
Days, maybe.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.374
This demon is very strong.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.501
The boy won't last long.

42:25.585 --> 42:29.797
What we need to do is to find out its name
in order to exorcize it.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.175
That is the only way we can save the boy.

42:32.759 --> 42:33.885
How do we do that?

42:34.427 --> 42:35.386
With prayer.

42:35.470 --> 42:36.846
Constant prayer.

42:37.638 --> 42:40.725
The demons, they are self-preserving.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.769
They do not understand suffering.

42:42.852 --> 42:44.854
Eventually, he will give himself up

42:44.937 --> 42:48.191
because he cannot stand
the pain of the prayer.

42:48.274 --> 42:49.233
You understand me?

42:49.776 --> 42:51.402
- Yes.
- Good. Good.

42:51.486 --> 42:54.322
- Now, you must confess your sins.
- Now?

42:54.405 --> 42:56.908
The demon can smell your sins
if they are not absolved.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.493
Come.

43:00.661 --> 43:01.788
We begin.

43:04.040 --> 43:05.374
Forgive me, Father...

43:06.292 --> 43:07.460
for I have sinned.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.796
It has been, uh...

43:09.879 --> 43:12.048
- eight months since my last confession--
- <i>Padre</i>, no.

43:12.131 --> 43:15.092
Did you just say eight months
since your last confession?

43:16.219 --> 43:17.720
- Yes.
- I...

43:19.388 --> 43:21.098
Okay, we just have to get this done.

43:21.182 --> 43:24.060
You are a man of God, simple enough, <i>sì?
</i>- Yes.

43:24.143 --> 43:26.229
And you are very, very sorry
for all of your sins.

43:27.063 --> 43:28.397
- Yes.
- Okay.

43:28.481 --> 43:31.275
May almighty God have mercy on you,

43:31.359 --> 43:37.281
and having forgiven your sins,
lead you to eternal peace. Amen.

43:37.365 --> 43:39.534
What rites of the exorcism do you know?

43:40.660 --> 43:42.161
- None.
- None?

43:42.745 --> 43:43.830
It has never come up.

43:43.913 --> 43:47.208
What prayer do you know that you could say
over and over, even under pressure?

43:49.001 --> 43:50.044
The Hail Mary.

43:51.462 --> 43:55.675
But if it is under pressure,
I would prefer to say it in Spanish.

43:55.758 --> 43:56.801
That's fine.

43:57.677 --> 44:00.346
Your job is to pray.

44:01.222 --> 44:03.182
Do not engage with the demon.

44:03.266 --> 44:06.853
Do not respond
to anything it says or does.

44:06.936 --> 44:09.105
Your job is to be <i>implacabile.</i>

44:09.188 --> 44:11.649
Relentless. Okay?

44:12.733 --> 44:13.860
Good boy.

44:15.111 --> 44:17.738
- You know any jokes?
- Eh... no.

44:17.822 --> 44:20.825
You should learn some.
The devil does not like jokes.

44:22.034 --> 44:22.869
Bring the books.

44:26.163 --> 44:28.875
The scent of heaven.

44:28.958 --> 44:31.961
I see you've brought your friend.

44:32.044 --> 44:35.298
He looks a little scared, Gabe.

44:35.381 --> 44:40.553
Mind if I call you Gabe, Gabe?

44:41.512 --> 44:43.598
Readying for battle?

44:43.681 --> 44:49.896
You ran out on me last time,
like the coward you are, soldier boy.

44:49.979 --> 44:52.982
Not very becoming of the chief exorcist.

44:53.065 --> 44:56.611
Who do you want to be
vanquished by today, Jesus or his mother?

44:56.694 --> 44:57.987
Fuck the Holy Mother.

44:58.070 --> 45:01.282
Are we going to talk all night,
or do you want to battle?

45:02.158 --> 45:04.827
Know what I'm going to do
to you, Gabriele?

45:05.453 --> 45:06.829
I'm going to fuck you.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.790
You'll sense yourself coming.

45:10.416 --> 45:14.545
And you'll hate yourself
for the release you feel when I fuck you.

45:16.255 --> 45:17.256
And now we pray.

45:20.343 --> 45:23.888
I command you, unclean spirit,
whoever you are,

45:23.971 --> 45:28.476
along with all of your minions
now attacking the servant of God, Henry,

45:28.559 --> 45:30.519
by the mysteries of the incarnation...

45:30.603 --> 45:33.022
- Fuck you and your incarnations.
- ...passion, resurrection

45:33.105 --> 45:37.360
and ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ,
by the descent of the Holy Spirit,

45:37.443 --> 45:41.489
by the coming of our Lord for judgment,
to tell me by some sign

45:41.572 --> 45:45.117
your name and the day
and hour of your departure.

45:45.201 --> 45:47.495
Tomás, pray. Pray.

45:47.578 --> 45:51.457
I command you,
moreover, to obey me to the letter,

45:51.540 --> 45:55.044
I who am a minister of God,
despite my unworthiness--

46:19.360 --> 46:20.528
Rosaria?

46:21.070 --> 46:23.406
Your sins will seek you out.

46:24.573 --> 46:26.575
My sins have been forgiven.

46:26.659 --> 46:30.579
But you can't forgive yourself,
can you, Father?

46:31.706 --> 46:35.876
Not for me, the girl you let die.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.587
Why did you do nothing?

46:39.296 --> 46:41.132
Why didn't you believe me?

46:41.716 --> 46:43.092
Now I am in hell.

46:43.926 --> 46:45.011
Deceiver.

46:45.094 --> 46:47.263
Her soul rests in peace.

46:47.346 --> 46:50.141
My soul rots in hell!

47:05.156 --> 47:06.782
How touching.

47:06.866 --> 47:08.117
Is that all you got?

47:08.200 --> 47:11.245
And how about you, panty sniffer?

47:12.830 --> 47:14.623
You didn't tell him, did you?

47:14.707 --> 47:17.209
About your little whore?

47:17.293 --> 47:20.713
Your little sweet treat, Adella.

47:21.422 --> 47:26.010
After you stood before your congregation
like you're better than them,

47:26.093 --> 47:28.179
when you're fucking their daughters.

47:28.804 --> 47:31.515
Maybe you aren't so sorry about that sin.

47:31.599 --> 47:33.059
- Hm?
- Shut up.

47:33.142 --> 47:34.143
Tomás. Tomás.

47:34.226 --> 47:35.728
Do not speak to it.

47:35.811 --> 47:38.314
- Pray.
- Run away.

47:38.397 --> 47:41.025
You don't want to be here, Tomás.

47:41.108 --> 47:43.944
You'd rather be fucking that little whore.

47:45.529 --> 47:48.532
Tomás! Tomás!
No! No, no! That's what it wants!

47:50.076 --> 47:51.160
Ah!

47:56.999 --> 47:58.626
You've been played, Amorth.

47:59.877 --> 48:01.712
You took the bait.

48:02.671 --> 48:05.549
And I'll destroy you.

48:05.633 --> 48:09.512
Your holy Church
will crumble from the inside.

48:24.944 --> 48:27.571
The abbey's records, Your Holiness.

49:06.318 --> 49:08.112
She was the love of my life.

49:16.412 --> 49:18.581
A promise was made.

49:20.166 --> 49:21.750
She wanted me to...

49:22.918 --> 49:25.588
leave the priesthood for her...

49:26.672 --> 49:27.798
but I had...

49:29.049 --> 49:32.595
no intention of doing that.

49:33.637 --> 49:36.807
So I just told her what she wanted.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.023
My love for God...

49:46.400 --> 49:48.110
it outweighed my love for her.

49:49.028 --> 49:51.322
Are you sorry for your sins?

49:52.698 --> 49:53.532
Yes.

49:54.116 --> 49:56.535
May almighty God show you mercy.

49:56.619 --> 50:02.750
And having forgiven your sins,
may he lead you to eternal life.

50:04.543 --> 50:05.502
Amen.

50:08.297 --> 50:09.131
Amen.

50:15.554 --> 50:16.388
Who is...

50:18.098 --> 50:19.141
Rosaria?

50:22.937 --> 50:25.856
She is a girl that I should've helped.

50:25.940 --> 50:29.026
The demon
is using her memory to deceive me.

50:29.109 --> 50:30.819
How does it know these things?

50:30.903 --> 50:32.821
It can sense our guilt,

50:33.405 --> 50:37.493
and it uses it against us
as a distraction.

50:38.661 --> 50:42.206
That boy,
he does not have long before he expires.

50:42.998 --> 50:45.584
We need to find out
the name of this demon.

50:46.252 --> 50:48.420
Knowing its name, it weakens them.

50:49.338 --> 50:51.006
I didn't mean to hurt him.

50:51.090 --> 50:52.341
I understand.

50:53.384 --> 50:54.385
See here.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.262
I have marked this page for you.

50:56.804 --> 50:57.721
Learn that.

51:00.557 --> 51:02.559
But it is in Latin.

51:02.643 --> 51:04.645
Close enough to Spanish.

51:04.728 --> 51:06.730
Prayer has more power in Latin.

51:11.986 --> 51:14.196
"You have taken the bait."

51:15.739 --> 51:18.200
- What?
- What it said to me.

51:18.284 --> 51:20.536
"You have taken the bait, Amorth."

51:24.164 --> 51:26.083
This is not about the boy.

51:26.166 --> 51:27.584
It has a bigger plan.

51:27.668 --> 51:29.837
I need to check something
I saw in the garden.

51:30.462 --> 51:33.882
Go. Take this. Be outside his door.
He is still in danger.

51:33.966 --> 51:37.553
We must protect him at all cost.
Do whatever you have to.

51:54.278 --> 51:55.779
The seal of the Vatican.

51:56.655 --> 51:59.908
<i>This place
has given the Church problems before.</i>

53:01.929 --> 53:05.140
God, by your name...

53:07.059 --> 53:09.561
save me.

53:11.939 --> 53:14.149
Help me.

53:20.114 --> 53:20.948
Henry?

54:22.718 --> 54:23.552
Henry?

54:37.566 --> 54:40.903
No one's getting out of here alive!

54:42.738 --> 54:44.490
No one.

55:41.088 --> 55:43.549
Let's see what secrets you are hiding.

56:08.031 --> 56:09.700
What happened?

56:17.708 --> 56:18.542
Go!

56:32.639 --> 56:34.474
Help me!

56:34.558 --> 56:35.475
Amorth!

56:37.436 --> 56:38.604
Help me!

56:39.563 --> 56:41.023
Help!

56:41.106 --> 56:41.940
Amy!

56:43.317 --> 56:46.028
In the name of Christ, let her go.

56:46.111 --> 56:48.405
In the name of Christ, let her go.

56:48.488 --> 56:49.990
Amy!

56:50.824 --> 56:51.658
Help!

56:52.326 --> 56:55.120
In the name of Christ, let her go.

56:55.203 --> 56:56.538
It's me. It's me.

56:56.622 --> 56:58.290
Oh, my God. Oh, Amy.

56:58.373 --> 57:02.044
In the name of Christ,
go away, Satan, go away!

57:22.939 --> 57:24.358
It's one of her nails.

57:25.442 --> 57:27.736
Tomás, take them to the chapel.

57:41.958 --> 57:44.211
Everything is redacted.

57:47.881 --> 57:50.717
"Our sins will seek us out."

58:06.817 --> 58:08.443
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

58:08.944 --> 58:12.656
You don't get to stay handsome
in this business for too long.

58:12.739 --> 58:14.241
Please. Hm? Don't.

58:14.324 --> 58:19.246
I once have a demon
try to put a crucifix into my eyeball.

58:19.329 --> 58:21.123
You're always talking and talking. Enough.

58:21.206 --> 58:22.749
Please.

58:22.833 --> 58:24.251
They're sleeping.

58:24.334 --> 58:25.460
No more stories.

58:28.922 --> 58:32.384
Did you consider why the demon does this?

58:32.467 --> 58:33.760
To scare us, hm?

58:33.844 --> 58:35.137
For what benefit?

58:35.721 --> 58:36.555
Chaos.

58:38.348 --> 58:39.516
Distraction.

58:39.599 --> 58:41.643
The devil is the great deceiver.

58:41.727 --> 58:43.854
He can make you see things from your past.

58:43.937 --> 58:47.733
Apparitions, memories,
always trying to deceive us.

58:47.816 --> 58:51.528
So we never know what he's thinking,
what he's planning.

58:52.821 --> 58:54.489
If you do not believe me...

58:55.407 --> 58:56.658
just ask my friend.

58:59.745 --> 59:02.038
Come, I'll show you what I found.

59:02.873 --> 59:03.832
Amorth!

59:03.915 --> 59:06.001
I noticed this when I first arrived.

59:12.215 --> 59:13.091
What is this?

59:14.009 --> 59:15.343
You recognize this?

59:16.261 --> 59:18.555
Yes, it's the seal
of the Spanish Inquisition.

59:18.638 --> 59:22.225
<i>Sì.</i> The darkest time
in the history of the Church.

59:23.185 --> 59:24.603
And they are...?

59:25.479 --> 59:28.440
The victims.
The ones who would not convert.

59:30.817 --> 59:32.778
There is something underneath this place.

59:33.361 --> 59:35.489
Something is hidden here. Come.

1:00:00.138 --> 1:00:01.014
Hold this.

1:00:10.273 --> 1:00:11.858
Two crossed keys.

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:13.527
Do you recognize this?

1:00:14.152 --> 1:00:16.363
It's the Vatican seal.

1:00:18.073 --> 1:00:20.700
- Is it gas?
- A little gas.

1:00:20.784 --> 1:00:23.662
A little sulfur. A little death.

1:00:23.745 --> 1:00:27.040
So no smoking, huh? Stand back.

1:00:39.261 --> 1:00:40.929
It's a door. Push with me.

1:00:41.012 --> 1:00:41.847
Okay.

1:01:05.078 --> 1:01:06.037
Catacomb.

1:01:06.705 --> 1:01:08.915
This is how they would bury the dead.

1:01:21.636 --> 1:01:24.431
I understand the Vatican
sealing this place off.

1:01:26.558 --> 1:01:28.768
But why would they leave someone?

1:01:29.269 --> 1:01:32.022
The ring of the cardinal protector.

1:01:36.860 --> 1:01:40.405
He was the final hope, the last protector.

1:01:42.657 --> 1:01:46.536
It looks like he's a prisoner,
but he's not.

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:50.332
The cage is for his own safety.

1:01:50.999 --> 1:01:57.839
They do this when an exorcism fails.
To protect against a demon's escape,

1:01:57.923 --> 1:02:01.301
to trap something
they need to remain hidden.

1:02:04.763 --> 1:02:07.807
Tomás, see if you can open this gate.

1:02:17.192 --> 1:02:22.489
"Your cardinal protector writes
to inform you of our worst fears.

1:02:22.572 --> 1:02:26.993
A great evil has taken hold
of San Sebastian Abbey.

1:02:27.077 --> 1:02:29.871
It must be buried here forever."

1:02:32.832 --> 1:02:33.708
It's locked.

1:02:34.376 --> 1:02:35.835
Then our friend here...

1:02:36.962 --> 1:02:38.380
must have a key.

1:02:44.761 --> 1:02:46.721
Where did you hide your key?

1:02:51.059 --> 1:02:52.394
In the stomach.

1:02:56.523 --> 1:02:57.857
Forgive me.

1:03:14.999 --> 1:03:16.167
Try this.

1:03:19.045 --> 1:03:19.879
Go.

1:03:24.342 --> 1:03:27.220
"All attempts at exorcism have failed.

1:03:27.303 --> 1:03:30.724
Satan owns this ground now.

1:03:31.349 --> 1:03:38.189
I have never seen
a demon this powerful before."

1:03:49.868 --> 1:03:50.994
Gabriele.

1:03:51.077 --> 1:03:51.995
Gabriele.

1:04:00.462 --> 1:04:01.463
It worked.

1:04:01.546 --> 1:04:02.505
Ah.

1:04:04.883 --> 1:04:06.217
Thank you, my friend.

1:04:19.731 --> 1:04:20.565
Amy?

1:04:37.582 --> 1:04:40.001
The gases and the sulfur,
it's getting stronger.

1:04:42.754 --> 1:04:44.631
We are getting closer to hell.

1:05:01.147 --> 1:05:03.316
Cardinal Sullivan, is he all right?

1:05:03.399 --> 1:05:04.567
He collapsed.

1:05:04.651 --> 1:05:05.819
Holy Father.

1:05:08.947 --> 1:05:11.032
You are just agitated.

1:05:11.950 --> 1:05:12.826
Tell him.

1:05:12.909 --> 1:05:14.536
Tell who?

1:05:17.038 --> 1:05:18.289
Gabriele.

1:05:18.873 --> 1:05:19.791
Gabriele?

1:05:20.875 --> 1:05:22.544
Amorth?

1:05:25.255 --> 1:05:26.422
Amorth?

1:05:26.506 --> 1:05:29.092
What trouble has he got us into this time?

1:05:32.679 --> 1:05:34.722
The Friar De Ojada.

1:05:36.933 --> 1:05:39.561
One of the greatest exorcists of all time.

1:05:46.234 --> 1:05:48.069
The seal of the Spanish Inquisition.

1:05:55.702 --> 1:05:57.203
His journal.

1:05:57.287 --> 1:05:58.621
"Today...

1:05:59.497 --> 1:06:02.041
I was summoned to the town of Segovia."

1:06:02.125 --> 1:06:03.668
A possessed monk.

1:06:03.751 --> 1:06:06.588
"In the year of our Lord 1475.

1:06:08.214 --> 1:06:11.009
While questioning the demon
possessing the monk,

1:06:11.092 --> 1:06:13.720
he answered me from the mouth of another.

1:06:14.679 --> 1:06:16.181
And then a third."

1:06:17.056 --> 1:06:18.725
Multiple possessions.

1:06:18.808 --> 1:06:20.310
It's a powerful demon.

1:06:39.495 --> 1:06:40.371
Amy?

1:06:55.428 --> 1:06:57.931
"The exorcist becomes possessed himself."

1:06:58.806 --> 1:06:59.933
Friar De Ojada?

1:07:00.016 --> 1:07:03.728
You know he is the man
who convinced Queen Isabella

1:07:03.811 --> 1:07:05.688
of the need for an Inquisition?

1:07:06.314 --> 1:07:10.360
So that means
from the time he is possessed in 1475,

1:07:10.443 --> 1:07:13.613
everything that happens after this...

1:07:14.614 --> 1:07:16.032
is the work of the devil.

1:07:17.617 --> 1:07:22.997
Centuries of persecution and torture,
the worst abuses of the Inquisition,

1:07:23.081 --> 1:07:26.501
all started by the friar
and done in the name of God

1:07:27.418 --> 1:07:28.753
by the devil.

1:07:30.338 --> 1:07:31.923
The Vatican must have known this.

1:07:32.632 --> 1:07:34.300
The Church covered it up.

1:07:34.384 --> 1:07:36.386
And they buried the truth here.

1:07:36.469 --> 1:07:39.389
"Your sins will seek you out."

1:07:39.472 --> 1:07:42.350
The construction work
must have freed the demon.

1:07:44.143 --> 1:07:45.144
Amy?

1:07:51.276 --> 1:07:52.235
Amy?

1:07:56.739 --> 1:07:57.573
Henry.

1:07:58.616 --> 1:08:00.159
- It's okay, Mommy.
- It's okay, Mommy.

1:08:00.743 --> 1:08:02.328
- Henry's okay.
- Henry's okay.

1:08:02.412 --> 1:08:03.871
Oh, that's great.

1:08:05.248 --> 1:08:07.208
Listen, Amy,
why don't you come downstairs with me?

1:08:07.292 --> 1:08:08.918
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

1:08:09.002 --> 1:08:11.671
- I don't know what got into me.
- I don't know what got into me.

1:08:12.797 --> 1:08:14.215
Well, that's okay.

1:08:15.300 --> 1:08:18.344
That's okay.
I just need your sister for a minute. Amy?

1:08:18.428 --> 1:08:20.388
- Can you forgive me, Mom?
- Can you forgive me, Mom?

1:08:31.733 --> 1:08:34.819
"The great dragon was hurled down.

1:08:34.902 --> 1:08:38.614
Hurled into the earth,
where he was bound."

1:08:38.698 --> 1:08:41.868
"And his angels with him." Revelations.

1:08:42.785 --> 1:08:46.414
Two hundred rogue angels
buried into the earth.

1:08:46.497 --> 1:08:49.959
This abbey
is one of those godforsaken places.

1:08:50.043 --> 1:08:52.462
This demon, he was trying to find them.

1:08:52.545 --> 1:08:56.257
To raise an army and destroy the Church.

1:08:56.341 --> 1:08:57.633
Amy, come here.

1:08:57.717 --> 1:08:59.886
- What's in your hand, Mommy?
- What's in your hand, Mommy?

1:09:00.803 --> 1:09:02.013
Amy, come here, right now.

1:09:02.096 --> 1:09:04.974
- What's in your hand, Mommy?
- What's in your hand, Mommy?

1:09:23.826 --> 1:09:24.952
Look.

1:09:28.289 --> 1:09:29.540
Watch me, Mommy.

1:09:29.624 --> 1:09:30.750
Watch me.

1:09:45.306 --> 1:09:46.307
His name...

1:09:48.393 --> 1:09:49.769
the king of hell...

1:09:50.937 --> 1:09:52.146
Asmodeus.

1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:03.241
Quickly!

1:10:07.912 --> 1:10:09.497
Amy, use the sedative.

1:10:18.339 --> 1:10:19.924
Tie his arms.

1:10:29.392 --> 1:10:30.726
We have his name.

1:10:39.777 --> 1:10:41.237
"Bring me the priest."

1:10:42.572 --> 1:10:43.823
What did you say?

1:10:43.906 --> 1:10:47.785
Those were the first words the demon said.
"Bring me the priest."

1:10:49.203 --> 1:10:50.580
It didn't mean me.

1:10:51.164 --> 1:10:52.540
It wants you.

1:10:52.623 --> 1:10:55.001
This demon feeds on exorcists.

1:10:55.668 --> 1:10:57.336
He had a plan once.

1:10:58.629 --> 1:11:00.465
To lure the friar here,

1:11:01.299 --> 1:11:03.759
hide amongst the righteous
and commit heinous acts

1:11:03.843 --> 1:11:05.261
in the name of God.

1:11:05.344 --> 1:11:07.555
He wants to do the same thing again.

1:11:07.638 --> 1:11:10.391
Using me to infiltrate the Church.

1:11:10.475 --> 1:11:12.685
What greater victory for the devil...

1:11:14.479 --> 1:11:17.690
than to claim the soul
of the pope's exorcist?

1:11:17.773 --> 1:11:20.568
Maybe. But we know his name now.

1:11:21.777 --> 1:11:23.988
So we have what we need to beat it

1:11:24.780 --> 1:11:26.449
and to save the child.

1:11:27.408 --> 1:11:30.536
The only thing
that can defeat us is ourselves.

1:11:33.581 --> 1:11:35.833
He will use your sins against you.

1:11:39.795 --> 1:11:41.547
I need to make confession.

1:11:42.215 --> 1:11:45.092
- To me?
- You are a priest, are you not?

1:11:47.678 --> 1:11:50.097
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

1:11:51.182 --> 1:11:52.433
Trust in the Lord.

1:11:55.811 --> 1:11:57.271
I want to talk to you...

1:11:58.981 --> 1:12:01.400
about things I have confessed before...

1:12:02.777 --> 1:12:04.403
but they still burden me.

1:12:05.571 --> 1:12:07.198
In 1942...

1:12:08.533 --> 1:12:10.618
during the war, I joined the Resistance.

1:12:10.701 --> 1:12:13.329
I became a partisan
and I fought against the fascists.

1:12:15.998 --> 1:12:18.918
<i>So many of my friends
would die to German bullets.</i>

1:12:21.837 --> 1:12:22.922
<i>Why them...</i>

1:12:24.131 --> 1:12:25.550
and not me?

1:12:27.260 --> 1:12:30.096
<i>Their dead bodies
would talk to me in my dreams.</i>

1:12:31.472 --> 1:12:33.933
<i>To die in a war is heroic.</i>

1:12:34.767 --> 1:12:36.185
To survive a war...

1:12:37.603 --> 1:12:38.646
complex.

1:12:42.692 --> 1:12:43.901
<i>And then I begin to see...</i>

1:12:44.777 --> 1:12:46.529
<i>that my life had been spared.</i>

1:12:46.612 --> 1:12:49.198
<i>It was my responsibility
to give it purpose.</i>

1:12:49.282 --> 1:12:51.993
<i>And in my case, that meant to serve God.</i>

1:12:54.829 --> 1:12:59.125
In all of my years, I have tried
to embrace what is said in Matthew.

1:12:59.792 --> 1:13:04.505
<i>"What you do for the least among you,
you do for me."</i>

1:13:05.506 --> 1:13:07.216
But when it mattered...

1:13:08.926 --> 1:13:10.177
I failed.

1:13:16.017 --> 1:13:17.184
<i>I did not help her,</i>

1:13:17.268 --> 1:13:18.686
<i>I did not believe her.</i>

1:13:19.645 --> 1:13:20.813
<i>I did not listen.</i>

1:13:21.689 --> 1:13:23.858
Rosaria?

1:13:23.941 --> 1:13:25.026
Rosaria.

1:13:25.651 --> 1:13:28.738
At night, the devil fucks me.

1:13:29.322 --> 1:13:31.866
What does this devil look like?

1:13:33.951 --> 1:13:34.785
You.

1:13:44.545 --> 1:13:46.297
She was not possessed.

1:13:47.340 --> 1:13:49.216
She was mentally disturbed.

1:13:49.967 --> 1:13:54.221
<i>So I let someone else handle her case.</i>

1:13:55.264 --> 1:13:56.098
Again...

1:13:57.767 --> 1:13:59.143
my pride.

1:13:59.226 --> 1:14:00.895
I was an exorcist.

1:14:00.978 --> 1:14:03.689
The mentally disturbed, it's not my job.

1:14:05.107 --> 1:14:06.942
Do you believe me now?

1:14:07.693 --> 1:14:10.237
<i>But that all changed because of her.</i>

1:14:17.662 --> 1:14:18.621
To hear

1:14:19.580 --> 1:14:21.082
after her death

1:14:21.791 --> 1:14:25.086
the rumors of the sexual abuse,
the coverup

1:14:25.169 --> 1:14:27.630
within the walls of the Vatican City.

1:14:29.090 --> 1:14:30.549
<i>That innocent girl.</i>

1:14:32.426 --> 1:14:35.596
I did not help her when she needed me.

1:14:38.516 --> 1:14:39.684
Her soul

1:14:40.601 --> 1:14:41.936
is my burden.

1:14:43.145 --> 1:14:45.439
And this demon, he knows that.

1:14:50.236 --> 1:14:51.487
I know you...

1:14:52.863 --> 1:14:56.909
as a humble man of God, Father Amorth.

1:14:57.743 --> 1:15:00.204
It's time to lay down that burden.

1:15:01.163 --> 1:15:02.581
Forgive me, Father.

1:15:05.042 --> 1:15:07.211
I absolve you of your sins

1:15:07.294 --> 1:15:11.590
in the name of the Father,
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

1:15:13.050 --> 1:15:13.884
Amen.

1:15:46.459 --> 1:15:49.503
I give you the miraculous medal.

1:15:50.129 --> 1:15:52.006
Holy fire insurance.

1:15:52.089 --> 1:15:53.174
Very powerful.

1:15:55.676 --> 1:15:57.386
To defeat the king of hell...

1:15:58.471 --> 1:16:00.347
we require the armor of God.

1:16:04.018 --> 1:16:05.644
To defeat the king of hell...

1:16:06.729 --> 1:16:08.522
we require the armor of God.

1:16:25.623 --> 1:16:29.835
Remember,
the demon will use your sins against you.

1:16:31.003 --> 1:16:34.965
Do not believe everything you see or hear.

1:16:36.717 --> 1:16:38.052
We have work to do.

1:16:39.929 --> 1:16:41.639
We must save this child.

1:17:16.048 --> 1:17:17.716
All done confessing?

1:17:18.300 --> 1:17:19.301
Father.

1:17:19.385 --> 1:17:22.930
Did he bare his soul to you, Tomás?

1:17:23.013 --> 1:17:26.058
Like your little whore bared her breasts?

1:17:27.685 --> 1:17:28.519
Ignore it.

1:17:29.061 --> 1:17:30.229
Pray for Henry.

1:17:30.312 --> 1:17:32.898
No amount of prayers can save Henry.

1:17:33.566 --> 1:17:35.693
Let me in, Gabriele.

1:17:35.776 --> 1:17:37.653
You know what I want.

1:17:39.321 --> 1:17:41.282
Our Father, who art in heaven...

1:17:41.365 --> 1:17:43.742
- In heaven, hallowed be thy name.
- ...hallowed be thy name.

1:17:43.826 --> 1:17:45.035
Thy kingdom come, thy...

1:17:45.119 --> 1:17:48.956
Was there really any point
confessing to your god, Gabe?

1:17:49.039 --> 1:17:53.794
- Give us this day our...
- Shouldn't you be confessing to her?

1:18:03.012 --> 1:18:05.681
You are not there.

1:18:05.764 --> 1:18:07.892
You are only in my mind.

1:18:09.727 --> 1:18:12.354
I burn in hell because of you!

1:18:12.438 --> 1:18:13.939
You are not there.

1:18:15.274 --> 1:18:17.359
You are only in my mind.

1:18:20.613 --> 1:18:23.407
- Father.
- Join us in hell, Gabe.

1:18:23.490 --> 1:18:24.533
Take me in.

1:18:24.617 --> 1:18:26.410
Don't you want me, Tomás?

1:18:28.078 --> 1:18:31.206
Tell me to get on my knees
and say my prayers.

1:18:31.290 --> 1:18:32.708
Fuck me, Tomás.

1:18:33.542 --> 1:18:36.170
- Deceiver.
- Fuck me, Tomás!

1:18:36.253 --> 1:18:37.838
- Deceiver!
- Fuck me, priest.

1:18:37.922 --> 1:18:40.341
- Oh, God.
- Tomás, focus on the prayer!

1:18:40.424 --> 1:18:41.425
Asmodeus!

1:18:42.551 --> 1:18:46.597
Asmodeus, king of Gehemma,
this is the cross of the Lord!

1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:50.017
Release this child
and flee from the light of God!

1:18:51.310 --> 1:18:52.770
See thee beneath God!

1:18:52.853 --> 1:18:54.355
Never. Get out.

1:18:54.438 --> 1:18:56.649
- Get out of my house.
- This is the house of God!

1:18:56.732 --> 1:18:58.025
Not without my son!

1:18:58.108 --> 1:18:59.318
Your son is gone.

1:18:59.401 --> 1:19:01.362
His soul burns and rots in hell.

1:19:01.445 --> 1:19:03.864
- Admit to thy name, Asmodeus.
- Never!

1:19:03.948 --> 1:19:06.200
And bow to the power of God almighty.

1:19:06.283 --> 1:19:08.285
- Take me in, Gabe.
- Oh, Mary...

1:19:09.411 --> 1:19:12.081
- ...Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou...
- And of the angels...

1:19:12.164 --> 1:19:13.457
I am king.

1:19:13.540 --> 1:19:15.250
You're under my dominion.

1:19:15.334 --> 1:19:19.630
- We humbly beseech you...
- And here you will remain damned forever!

1:19:19.713 --> 1:19:21.507
...now and at the hour of our death.

1:19:21.590 --> 1:19:23.175
...to crush Satan's skull.

1:19:23.258 --> 1:19:26.345
I am Asmodeus, king of hell.

1:19:26.428 --> 1:19:28.764
And I command you!

1:19:28.847 --> 1:19:34.061
We beseech thee to send thy holy angels,
that under thy command and by thy power,

1:19:34.645 --> 1:19:38.816
they may pursue the evil spirits,
encounter them on every side,

1:19:38.899 --> 1:19:40.067
resist their bold attacks,

1:19:40.859 --> 1:19:43.612
and drive them hence
into the abyss of woe!

1:19:59.712 --> 1:20:00.713
Mommy?

1:20:03.132 --> 1:20:05.634
Mom, help me.

1:20:06.427 --> 1:20:08.429
Speak to him, Julia. Speak to him.

1:20:08.512 --> 1:20:10.014
A mother's love never fails.

1:20:10.097 --> 1:20:12.349
Henry. Henry, I love you.

1:20:12.433 --> 1:20:14.643
- Call to him.
- Henry, come back to me.

1:20:15.436 --> 1:20:17.271
Henry, please talk to me.

1:20:21.191 --> 1:20:23.944
Mommy, they're hurting me.

1:20:24.028 --> 1:20:24.945
Oh, God.

1:20:25.029 --> 1:20:26.780
Henry, we need your help.

1:20:27.364 --> 1:20:28.782
You must resist.

1:20:28.866 --> 1:20:30.075
I can't.

1:20:30.159 --> 1:20:31.493
You must resist!

1:20:33.620 --> 1:20:34.580
Mom?

1:20:38.125 --> 1:20:39.126
Henry.

1:20:52.765 --> 1:20:53.807
What's happening?

1:20:59.021 --> 1:21:00.230
Oh, my God.

1:21:00.314 --> 1:21:01.565
Holy shit.

1:21:02.483 --> 1:21:03.984
Almighty God.

1:21:10.949 --> 1:21:12.201
It's in them both.

1:21:22.336 --> 1:21:23.545
Amy.

1:21:49.404 --> 1:21:51.657
- Give me what I want!
- No!

1:21:54.493 --> 1:21:56.245
Surrender yourself to me.

1:22:07.548 --> 1:22:08.674
Julia!

1:22:25.149 --> 1:22:27.067
I told you, bitch.

1:22:27.151 --> 1:22:28.694
You're all gonna die!

1:22:28.777 --> 1:22:31.029
- Amy, please.
- Amy's gone.

1:22:32.072 --> 1:22:34.408
Julia, resist!

1:22:34.491 --> 1:22:35.701
Don't lose faith!

1:22:35.784 --> 1:22:37.995
Give me back my children!

1:22:38.078 --> 1:22:39.830
Your children are gone!

1:22:41.081 --> 1:22:42.249
Please.

1:22:42.332 --> 1:22:43.542
Amy, please.

1:22:43.625 --> 1:22:44.960
I love you.

1:22:55.053 --> 1:22:57.514
It's me you want. Let the children go.

1:22:57.598 --> 1:22:59.433
They all suffer because of you.

1:22:59.516 --> 1:23:01.768
Say the words, piggy.

1:23:05.731 --> 1:23:08.525
Be the martyr you dreamed of being.

1:23:09.151 --> 1:23:11.361
Be my piggy.

1:23:11.445 --> 1:23:12.946
Take me.

1:23:27.586 --> 1:23:28.629
Mom?

1:23:31.048 --> 1:23:33.425
No, Gabriele!

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:52.194
Father.

1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:01.119
Mommy?

1:24:02.162 --> 1:24:03.455
What have you done?

1:24:03.538 --> 1:24:05.624
- Take the cross from my hand.
- Okay.

1:24:05.707 --> 1:24:06.583
- Take it.
- Okay.

1:24:06.667 --> 1:24:08.794
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:24:08.877 --> 1:24:11.421
Oh, my God. Henry, you came back to me.

1:24:11.505 --> 1:24:12.714
- You're safe now.
- Take it!

1:24:14.508 --> 1:24:16.051
Get them out of here. Go!

1:24:16.134 --> 1:24:17.386
Hey. Hey.

1:24:17.469 --> 1:24:18.804
Julia, we have to go!

1:24:18.887 --> 1:24:20.389
- Put your arms around me.
- Let's go.

1:24:20.472 --> 1:24:22.432
Come on, run. Amy, come on.

1:24:27.354 --> 1:24:29.189
<i>Your soul is mine.</i>

1:24:39.366 --> 1:24:40.951
<i>Sullivan.</i>

1:24:41.868 --> 1:24:42.786
<i>Sullivan!</i>

1:25:04.975 --> 1:25:08.520
<i>I knew you would sacrifice yourself
to save those children,</i>

1:25:08.603 --> 1:25:10.439
<i>and now you are mine.</i>

1:25:19.531 --> 1:25:21.074
Come on. Hurry.

1:25:23.702 --> 1:25:26.246
The boy, he's safe now.
Just get away from here.

1:25:29.791 --> 1:25:31.293
- Go.
- Thank you, Father.

1:25:39.009 --> 1:25:40.510
<i>I need my pig, Gabe.</i>

1:25:49.061 --> 1:25:51.730
You will not take me.

1:25:51.813 --> 1:25:54.316
You will not take me!

1:25:54.399 --> 1:25:56.860
<i>You prideful fool.</i>

1:25:56.943 --> 1:25:59.029
<i>The friar said the exact same thing.</i>

1:26:00.197 --> 1:26:01.615
Forgive me, Lord.

1:26:04.951 --> 1:26:05.952
<i>Not yet!</i>

1:26:06.036 --> 1:26:09.414
<i>I need my pig
to get me inside the Vatican, Gabe.</i>

1:27:05.137 --> 1:27:06.388
Gabriele!

1:27:16.857 --> 1:27:18.692
Damn us both...

1:27:19.359 --> 1:27:20.986
to hell.

1:27:56.229 --> 1:27:57.355
Gabriele!

1:28:00.650 --> 1:28:01.693
Gabriele!

1:28:30.096 --> 1:28:32.265
You're too late, Tomás.

1:28:32.933 --> 1:28:36.102
He's gone, your friend. Gone.

1:28:36.686 --> 1:28:37.854
So...

1:28:40.232 --> 1:28:41.107
run along.

1:28:41.191 --> 1:28:44.694
It would be my great pleasure

1:28:44.778 --> 1:28:49.741
to excoriate your soul
and eviscerate your memory.

1:28:49.824 --> 1:28:53.119
Gabriele, listen to me. Fight it.

1:28:53.203 --> 1:28:55.205
It is just in your head.

1:28:55.288 --> 1:28:57.290
We can only be defeated by ourselves.

1:28:58.083 --> 1:28:59.626
He is not here!

1:28:59.709 --> 1:29:03.838
The little piggy is slopping
at hell's trough, where he belongs.

1:29:04.714 --> 1:29:07.676
I know you're here, Gabriele.
Pray with me.

1:29:09.594 --> 1:29:13.431
God is not here!

1:29:13.515 --> 1:29:15.725
God is always in our hearts.

1:29:15.809 --> 1:29:17.060
Focus on the prayer.

1:29:18.520 --> 1:29:19.896
"Where two of you gather...

1:29:20.897 --> 1:29:23.316
in my name, there am I."

1:29:24.109 --> 1:29:26.152
Lord, have mercy.

1:29:26.236 --> 1:29:29.072
Say it! Lord, have mercy!

1:29:33.076 --> 1:29:35.870
God is with you, Gabriele. Find him!

1:29:36.454 --> 1:29:37.831
Finish it, Tomás.

1:29:37.914 --> 1:29:39.124
Finish it!

1:29:39.207 --> 1:29:43.712
God, by your name, save me.

1:29:44.337 --> 1:29:48.592
Judge me in thy strength.

1:29:48.675 --> 1:29:51.720
O God, hear my prayer.

1:29:51.803 --> 1:29:54.848
Listen to the words of my mouth.

1:29:54.931 --> 1:29:58.393
Behold, God is my helper.

1:29:59.144 --> 1:30:00.770
<i>Give up. He is mine.</i>

1:30:00.854 --> 1:30:05.442
I adjure you
in the name of the spotless lamb.

1:30:05.525 --> 1:30:08.028
The word made flesh commands you.

1:30:08.111 --> 1:30:09.571
Asmodeus!

1:30:09.654 --> 1:30:12.574
Jesus of Nazareth commands you!

1:30:12.657 --> 1:30:17.412
And now, I adjure you in his name!

1:30:19.164 --> 1:30:21.791
Lord, heed my prayer!

1:30:21.875 --> 1:30:24.210
- Say it!
<i>- No!</i>

1:30:27.380 --> 1:30:29.674
- Gabriele.
<i>- We're not done yet.</i>

1:30:35.597 --> 1:30:38.224
<i>You're coming to hell, priests.</i>

1:30:38.975 --> 1:30:41.353
<i>I will take you both.</i>

1:30:45.899 --> 1:30:46.983
Adella.

1:31:11.132 --> 1:31:13.259
Your sins will seek...

1:31:13.343 --> 1:31:14.636
Seek you out!

1:31:14.719 --> 1:31:16.513
Tomás, use the medal!

1:31:16.596 --> 1:31:19.015
Lord, grant me the power!

1:31:29.401 --> 1:31:30.360
Gabriele!

1:31:32.904 --> 1:31:35.573
Asmodeus. In the name of the Holy Mother.

1:31:35.657 --> 1:31:39.035
See thee beneath God.

1:31:40.412 --> 1:31:42.747
See thee beneath God!

1:31:44.874 --> 1:31:47.127
Tomás! Pray the final rites.

1:31:48.586 --> 1:31:54.300
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit...

1:31:55.301 --> 1:31:57.220
see thee beneath God!

1:32:18.950 --> 1:32:21.536
Gabriele, are you okay?

1:32:27.417 --> 1:32:28.460
Not so bad.

1:32:33.298 --> 1:32:35.008
- Tomás.
- What?

1:32:36.551 --> 1:32:37.969
You look like shit.

1:32:41.973 --> 1:32:43.475
Bless you, Tomás.

1:32:44.434 --> 1:32:46.060
You learned the Latin.

1:32:47.937 --> 1:32:50.648
Yes, it's similar to the Spanish.

1:32:50.732 --> 1:32:53.401
Very similar to the Spanish.

1:32:57.489 --> 1:32:58.573
Look.

1:33:03.077 --> 1:33:08.374
You know, the God,
he works in very mysterious ways.

1:33:14.214 --> 1:33:15.048
For you.

1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:26.309
Yes, he does.

1:33:35.151 --> 1:33:35.985
Cuckoo.

1:33:44.744 --> 1:33:46.246
Is that you, Gabriele?

1:33:46.830 --> 1:33:48.790
Yes, Your Holiness.

1:33:48.873 --> 1:33:51.584
And I have brought
Padre Esquibel to meet you.

1:33:51.668 --> 1:33:53.545
You look well, Your Holiness.

1:33:53.628 --> 1:33:56.214
Thanks to you both. I'm glad to see you.

1:33:57.006 --> 1:33:58.800
You had me worried this time.

1:33:59.467 --> 1:34:01.010
Sounded dangerous.

1:34:01.094 --> 1:34:02.887
Yeah, not too bad.

1:34:03.930 --> 1:34:06.558
Sometimes you fly
a little too close to the sun.

1:34:07.642 --> 1:34:09.227
It has not killed me yet.

1:34:09.310 --> 1:34:11.521
The Church will not forget
what you have done.

1:34:11.604 --> 1:34:15.400
You struck a mighty blow for our side.

1:34:15.483 --> 1:34:18.111
Saint Michael would be proud.

1:34:19.070 --> 1:34:22.282
And this is why God
put you here, Gabriele.

1:34:22.365 --> 1:34:24.367
Thank you very much, Your Holiness.

1:34:24.450 --> 1:34:28.997
And God has made a good choice
in you too, Father Esquibel.

1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:30.415
Thank you, Holy Father.

1:34:30.498 --> 1:34:35.879
The congregation
has requested a full report on Spain.

1:34:35.962 --> 1:34:37.338
A full report.

1:34:37.422 --> 1:34:42.176
So Cardinal Sullivan can tell me again
that evil only exists in my imagination?

1:34:42.260 --> 1:34:43.177
You haven't heard?

1:34:43.845 --> 1:34:47.849
Cardinal Sullivan has taken a sabbatical
in the Isle of Guam.

1:34:51.144 --> 1:34:54.063
I shall pray for Guam.

1:34:56.482 --> 1:34:59.903
And who has, uh, filled his shoes?

1:34:59.986 --> 1:35:03.823
I have found someone far more trustworthy.

1:35:05.116 --> 1:35:07.577
I will leave you in his good hands.

1:35:12.123 --> 1:35:15.126
See thee beneath God.

1:35:15.209 --> 1:35:17.086
- See thee beneath God.
- See thee beneath God.

1:35:22.008 --> 1:35:24.719
Welcome to the holiest of holies.

1:35:24.802 --> 1:35:26.512
Twelve centuries of treasures.

1:35:27.096 --> 1:35:29.599
Letters from saints and apostles.

1:35:29.682 --> 1:35:32.352
Books of wisdom and piety.

1:35:32.435 --> 1:35:34.270
Revelations of the spirit.

1:35:34.854 --> 1:35:38.399
The entire canon of Christian thought.

1:35:39.567 --> 1:35:42.195
The Vatican has purchased the abbey
from the Vasquez family

1:35:42.278 --> 1:35:44.280
and reconsecrated the soil.

1:35:44.364 --> 1:35:47.617
The family has safely relocated
back to the U.S.,

1:35:47.700 --> 1:35:49.827
where the boy made a full recovery.

1:35:54.040 --> 1:35:58.461
The friar's diary is proving very useful,
despite his abhorrence.

1:35:58.544 --> 1:36:02.882
Asmodeus has been defeated,
but there are many more to be found.

1:36:02.966 --> 1:36:08.513
Soon we will know
all of the other 199 sites on earth

1:36:08.596 --> 1:36:10.556
where God is not welcome.

1:36:11.224 --> 1:36:14.310
Gabriele, will you take on this task?

1:36:16.771 --> 1:36:21.067
This would be more
than a lifetime's work for one priest.

1:36:22.318 --> 1:36:23.653
But two priests...

1:36:25.530 --> 1:36:28.574
What do you think, Tomás?
Can you see this now as a calling?

1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:33.204
And that we must serve God
the way he wants us to serve him?

1:36:35.873 --> 1:36:37.291
Let's go to work.

1:36:40.128 --> 1:36:41.879
Let's go to hell.
