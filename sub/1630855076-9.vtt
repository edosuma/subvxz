09:08.173 --> 09:09.841
like Dean once told me,

09:09.841 --> 09:11.509
never back down
from a challenge.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.344
His greatest fault.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.430
He gave terrible advice.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.639
Come on.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.724
(quiet chatter)

09:17.724 --> 09:19.517
How's the, uh...
how's the hotel?

09:19.517 --> 09:21.519
Oh, the Malden Inn?

09:21.519 --> 09:23.063
It's fine. It's fine.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.859
Did you know it's right next
to a 24-hour auto parts store?

09:27.859 --> 09:29.986
Oh.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.113
-I didn't.
-No, it's fine. It's fine.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.323
-(exhales)
-You just might

09:33.323 --> 09:35.075
want to file that away
for next time.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.994
-Noted.
-(chuckles)

09:37.994 --> 09:40.497
Oh, he was such
an incredible musician.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.581
Yeah.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.000
An actual prodigy.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.669
Oh, of course you knew that.
(chuckles)

09:46.669 --> 09:49.589
Yeah, I-I put it in the attic
when he got sick.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.924
But it just-- It felt wrong.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.093
And...

09:53.093 --> 09:54.928
I really want Samantha
to have it.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.513
Can you imagine
what it would have been like

09:56.513 --> 09:58.556
if he had made
principal cellist for the Phil?

09:58.556 --> 10:00.016
Oh.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.185
He was so close.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.603
(sighs)

10:03.603 --> 10:05.188
It must have been
really devastating for him.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.068
Oh, hey.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.402
Hey, I didn't mean to say...

10:11.402 --> 10:14.280
David loved being a father.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.074
Oh, I know. I know.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.451
Of course.
I'm just saying that...

10:18.451 --> 10:20.703
once you got pregnant,

10:20.703 --> 10:22.789
things got
a little bit more complicated.

10:23.915 --> 10:24.916
That's all.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.209
(chuckles softly)

10:28.461 --> 10:30.296
Hey. Do you think we should get
some more chairs in here?

10:30.296 --> 10:32.298
It looks like people are looking
for somewhere to sit down.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.135
(sighs softly)

10:36.636 --> 10:39.264
This is definitely the weirdest
way I've ever mourned

10:39.264 --> 10:40.890
a casual acquaintance.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.433
Dean would have wanted it
this way.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.726
Maybe.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.228
Life's kind of like air hockey,

10:45.228 --> 10:47.063
-don't you think?
-Uh-oh.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.232
Might have a hard time hanging
out with you after I hear this.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.817
(chuckles):
I don't know.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.819
We spend our days
getting whacked around,

10:52.819 --> 10:56.281
and then, one day, we just
disappear down some black hole.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.324
Dude, that is some deep shit.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.325
(clacking)

10:59.325 --> 11:01.286
I win again!

11:01.286 --> 11:02.996
Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.455
Hold on.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.499
You ever think
about what happens when we die?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.501
Well, I'm not a medically
trained professional,

11:08.501 --> 11:10.920
but I'm pretty sure
you generally stop breathing.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.423
Well, our pastor was
talking about Miss Evans,

11:13.423 --> 11:15.300
this woman in our congregation.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.261
And he was there when she died,
and he said that

11:18.261 --> 11:21.181
there was a calmness that
went over the room,

11:21.181 --> 11:23.224
like a presence.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.018
Sorry, can we go back a second?

11:25.018 --> 11:28.897
Your, uh... your pastor?

11:28.897 --> 11:32.192
Oh, yeah, I have been going
back to church with my family.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.860
-Huh.
-I don't know,

11:33.860 --> 11:36.154
church kind of filled in
a missing piece for me.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.781
I feel like somebody
threw me a life vest.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.742
But you still didn't
answer my question.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.076
Do I have to?

11:42.076 --> 11:43.536
Can't we just go play Skee-Ball,

11:43.536 --> 11:45.330
and you can spend
a shit-ton of money

11:45.330 --> 11:46.956
trying to win me
a stuffed animal?

11:46.956 --> 11:48.625
That's exactly what would happen
'cause I suck at those games.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.084
You suck at all games.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.711
I'll win one for you.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.129
You really don't want
to talk about this, do you?

11:53.129 --> 11:54.339
Who wants to talk about death?

11:55.548 --> 11:57.425
Death comes to all of us.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.845
It's something that
we must accept.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.680
To live is to die.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.476
Well, that's literally
my suicide note.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.811
-(door opens)
-Oh, my God.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.313
(door closes)

12:10.313 --> 12:12.023
Mm. Joel.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.983
-Hey, Sam.
-Hi.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.694
-I'm so sorry about your dad.
-Thank you.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.738
Can I get you anything?
You want something to drink?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.198
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I'll have a beer.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.866
-Okay, good.
-Just not an IPA.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.243
Tastes like a mouthful
of pennies.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.454
Mm. I like that taste.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.665
(laughing) Do you remember
when we were hanging out

12:28.665 --> 12:30.333
with that guy Allen,

12:30.333 --> 12:32.460
and you kept calling
his girlfriend Phoebe?

12:32.460 --> 12:34.128
It was something close
to Phoebe, was it not?

12:34.128 --> 12:36.673
Absolutely not.
It was Emma.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.132
-It was Emma?
-I told you that, like,

12:38.132 --> 12:39.300
a hundred times that night.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.468
Is that why she was
so mean to me?

12:40.468 --> 12:42.428
SAMANTHA:
Yes! Brit. Hi.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.930
Would you please open
another bottle of wine?

12:43.930 --> 12:45.181
Sure.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.434
Sorry, I just can't find
the bottle opener.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.354
Wow, is that actually
how you look for things?

12:51.354 --> 12:53.690
That was the saddest
excuse for...

12:53.690 --> 12:54.983
Oh, no!

12:54.983 --> 12:57.235
What is this, on ice skates?
Shit!

12:57.235 --> 12:59.529
-Oh!
-I'll go get more.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.863
It's just rolls.
No one's gonna eat these.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.198
-Samantha, hi.
-Hi.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.449
Can you keep your voice
down a little bit?

13:03.449 --> 13:04.784
The rabbi can hear you.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.452
-Sorry.
-Okay.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.621
W-Wait. Aunt Alice,
have you met Joel?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.748
-No.
-Oh, oh, meet Joel.
-Hi.

13:10.748 --> 13:11.749
We used to date
back in high school.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.834
-Hi.
-He's the best guy.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.502
-I'm Alice.
-The best guy.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.129
And my dad always said that.
He said you were the best guy.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.755
JOEL:
Well, I don't know.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.340
-I never heard him say that.
-It's true.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.925
Oh, my gosh, wait.
Did I tell you about

13:20.925 --> 13:22.343
his laser disc movie collection
that I found?

13:22.343 --> 13:24.679
-No.
-It's incredible.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.180
And there is something in it

13:26.180 --> 13:27.765
that I think you're gonna
want to see.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.183
Is it Dirty Dancing?

13:29.183 --> 13:31.060
Obviously it's Dirty Dancing.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.981
-Come on.
-Oh, my God. Careful...

13:34.981 --> 13:36.691
Okay, you undersold this
'cause you told me

13:36.691 --> 13:38.568
he had one copy
of Dirty Dancing.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.778
He has two, and one of them is
still in the shrink-wrap.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.155
-(Samantha laughs)
-Are you kidding me?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.115
Take it.

13:44.115 --> 13:47.493
-What? No, I couldn't do that.
-Come on.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.703
I want you to have it.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.747
That's very sweet.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.874
Joel, can I tell you something?

13:52.874 --> 13:54.834
-Yeah.
-Come here.

13:58.921 --> 14:02.216
My dad, he was right about you.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.469
-Uh...
-You are the best guy.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.138
(Samantha chuckles)

14:07.138 --> 14:09.557
And listen, I...

14:09.557 --> 14:12.977
I know that
I messed everything up.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.687
And I hurt you.

14:16.397 --> 14:19.108
But I didn't...

14:19.108 --> 14:21.027
I didn't mean to.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.116
I-I know that.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.454
I missed you, Joel.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.372
♪ ♪

14:40.421 --> 14:42.131
I missed you, too.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.184

Mom?

15:00.566 --> 15:01.734

15:06.280 --> 15:08.366
We can't leave that buffet table

15:08.366 --> 15:11.536
unattended, Samantha,
because the Blums eat rugelach

15:11.536 --> 15:13.913
like they've never
seen food before.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.963
Alice, what are you doing?

15:21.963 --> 15:23.131
I'm taking this with me.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.799
CAROL:
No, Alice, please.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.051
ALICE: After the spectacle
that I just saw here today,

15:27.051 --> 15:28.719
I don't think
she deserves to have this.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.557
This cello is all
I have left of my brother.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.433
And I'm not leaving it
in this house

15:34.433 --> 15:36.561
-for one more second.
-Alice...

15:36.561 --> 15:38.688
it belongs to Samantha.
Please.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.982
I doubt she'll even notice.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.359
(snorts) I notice
a lot of things, Aunt Alice.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.402
I'm very observant.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.195
I noticed today you've been

15:46.195 --> 15:47.947
very hard on my mother.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.907
And I noticed that
the whole time my dad was sick,

15:49.907 --> 15:52.451
which was for months and months,

15:52.451 --> 15:55.621
she was there every
single second.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.832
And when he didn't sleep,
neither did she.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.668
Another thing that comes to mind

16:00.668 --> 16:03.546
is that you only
visited him once

16:03.546 --> 16:05.631
that whole time
he was in the hospital.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.508
Why was that?

16:07.508 --> 16:09.594
Give this cello back to me
right now, Sam.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.804
I would rather smash
this thing to bits

16:11.804 --> 16:14.348
than let you leave here with it.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.766
Carol, can you control
your daughter

16:15.766 --> 16:17.143
even for one second?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.644
No, I can't.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.981

Hey.

-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

I'm okay, I'm okay.
I just, um...

16:48.799 --> 16:51.427
Am I supposed to just
watch her do this to herself?

16:51.427 --> 16:54.305
I don't know why I keep trying.

16:54.305 --> 16:57.850
But she's my best friend,
and I love her.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.772
I get it.

17:02.772 --> 17:06.734
It's-it's an impossible
situation.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.654
I mean, she gives you these,
these little glimpses

17:09.654 --> 17:12.156
-of the person she used to be.
-Exactly.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.991
-Like flashes of the old Sam.
-Yeah, right?

17:13.991 --> 17:18.454
And that person is, like,
so amazing and sweet,

17:18.454 --> 17:20.957

you want her back so badly.

17:20.957 --> 17:24.001

17:24.001 --> 17:28.923
But it's not real.

17:28.923 --> 17:32.802
You know, it's like a bad joke.
(scoffs)

17:32.802 --> 17:36.389
And you just feel like
such a jerk.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.974
You're not a jerk.

17:40.518 --> 17:43.145
Do you want to go get coffee
and talk a little?

17:43.145 --> 17:46.107
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, that'd be nice.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.279
Geez, relax, okay?

18:33.279 --> 18:35.489
It was a simple
yes or no question.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.158
I'm sorry it didn't reach
the existential heights

18:37.158 --> 18:38.868
of "life is like air hockey."

18:38.868 --> 18:41.203
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

18:41.203 --> 18:42.955
Forget I said anything.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.207
-I thought you'd be into it.
-This isn't about me.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.084
It's about you
and what you need.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.378
Because you've just
been avoiding

18:49.378 --> 18:51.339
what this entire day is
supposed to be about.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.798
Fine. What do you want
to talk about?

18:52.798 --> 18:54.717
Dean's blood alcohol content
when he clipped that pole?

18:54.717 --> 18:56.344
Or how he hung on
at the hospital

18:56.344 --> 18:57.678
before he went into
cardiac arrest?

18:57.678 --> 18:58.804
Is that what you want
to talk about?

18:58.804 --> 18:59.889
Yeah, maybe I do.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.724
-Uh-huh.
-Maybe it'll make me feel

19:01.724 --> 19:04.018
scared as hell,
'cause deep down I know

19:04.018 --> 19:07.855
that could be me someday,
or you.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.900
So thanks for the invitation,
but I'm gonna pass.

19:17.615 --> 19:22.078
Mm, your father could eat
a whole bowl of that by himself.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.622
-It's so good.
-Yeah.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.040
I wonder what the rabbi
would think about

19:26.040 --> 19:27.750
me going to town on this
right now.

19:27.750 --> 19:31.629
Screw the rabbi.
The crab cost me 50 bucks.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.172
-Hell yeah, Mom.
-So enjoy.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.882
Thank you.
It's delicious.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.884
(laughs)

19:36.884 --> 19:38.219
Mm.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.191
(crying)

19:52.191 --> 19:54.360
Oh, honey...

19:54.360 --> 19:56.028
I know.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.573
I know.

19:59.573 --> 20:02.118
-(Samantha sobbing)
-I know, I know, I know.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.577
I know.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.248
It's all right.

20:10.918 --> 20:14.046
I'm just... (sniffles)

20:14.046 --> 20:15.840
I'm just gonna go to sleep,
okay?

20:15.840 --> 20:17.341
-I'm really tired.
-Okay, honey.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.592
Okay.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.182
Good night, Mom.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.059
Oh!

20:27.059 --> 20:29.478
-CAROL: Oh, no, no, no!
-No, no, I didn't mean it.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.730
CAROL:
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

20:30.730 --> 20:32.940
-I just...
-Oh, God, why?

20:32.940 --> 20:34.859
Oh...

20:34.859 --> 20:37.111
Why?

20:37.111 --> 20:39.780
Why do you have to be like this?

20:39.780 --> 20:41.115
Why?!

20:41.115 --> 20:44.618
Why do you ruin...

20:44.618 --> 20:46.162
everything?

20:47.872 --> 20:49.457
Yeah, I was wondering
when things would

20:49.457 --> 20:51.500
go back to normal around here.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.088
♪ ♪

21:01.969 --> 21:04.013

21:18.027 --> 21:20.237
Hi.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.906
Sorry, I know it's really late.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.324
I should have called first,

21:23.324 --> 21:24.909
but I was just
in the neighborhood,

21:24.909 --> 21:28.120
and I thought I could, you know,
come see the house.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.041
Oh, uh, sure. Yeah.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.335
-Come in.
-Cool.
