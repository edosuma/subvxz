00:02.336 --> 00:04.505
Previously on
Wisdom of the Crowd...
As soon as you had

00:04.538 --> 00:06.074
the offer from Nell,

00:06.107 --> 00:08.309
you should have consulted
with me.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.178
I-It's about Mia.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.279
It's not, it's not about you.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.247
That much is bloody clear.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.383
I was a pawn
in a game.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.118
I'm never gonna be
okay with that.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.419
Look at this.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.521
Jeffrey Tanner's trying
to help you.
Ma...

00:20.554 --> 00:22.056
TANNER:
The guy that paid Flaco

00:22.090 --> 00:24.325
to attack Carlos Ochoa--

00:24.358 --> 00:25.259
we have video on him.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.661
"If Carlos says anything
about Mia Tanner,

00:27.695 --> 00:29.230
you need to take him out."

00:30.298 --> 00:34.102
*

00:43.444 --> 00:46.547
* You can believe in
everything you see *

00:46.580 --> 00:48.582
* That don't bother me *

00:50.451 --> 00:53.421
* You can smile
at everyone you see *

00:53.454 --> 00:55.423
* That don't worry me *

00:55.456 --> 00:58.159
* I just want to hold you

00:58.192 --> 01:00.328
(computer chimes softly)
* In my arms

01:00.361 --> 01:03.431
(chiming continues)
* Hold you in my arms

01:03.464 --> 01:07.067
* If you could know
all the hurt in me *

01:09.203 --> 01:13.607
* If you gave me all your love

01:13.641 --> 01:16.244
* That would be enough

01:16.277 --> 01:20.281
* If you gave me all your love

01:20.314 --> 01:23.217
* That would be enough
(knocking quietly)

01:23.251 --> 01:24.485
Mr. Tanner?

01:24.518 --> 01:27.321
* All your love

01:27.355 --> 01:28.622
* That would be enough...
Mr. Tanner?

01:28.656 --> 01:30.624
What?
I'm sorry to
bother you. Um...

01:30.658 --> 01:32.593
I'm user admin...

01:32.626 --> 01:34.595
I mean, I'm Megan.
I work in user admin.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.597
We just got a message
from a user

01:36.630 --> 01:38.399
saying that he knows something
about the guy in the video--

01:38.432 --> 01:39.433
the one who went

01:39.467 --> 01:40.734
to the prison--

01:40.768 --> 01:42.236
and i-it was
marked as urgent.

01:42.270 --> 01:43.737
I-I think Sara left...

01:43.771 --> 01:45.606
I'm sorry. I'm sure it can wait
until tomorrow.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.275
Put it up on my screen
right now. Right now. Thank you.

01:54.248 --> 01:54.648
(ringing)

01:57.251 --> 01:58.519
Hey. Anthony?

01:58.552 --> 01:59.753
ANTHONY: Oh. Uh... yeah,
hang on a second.

01:59.787 --> 02:00.721
Sorry, let me...
let me pull over.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.228
Yeah, it's Jeffrey Tanner here.
ANTHONY: Wow, okay.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.596
When they said somebody
would be getting back to me,

02:08.629 --> 02:10.264
I didn't think that
they meant you, personally.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.332
What do you got for me?

02:12.300 --> 02:12.966
Okay, look, I could get
in a lot of trouble

02:13.000 --> 02:15.169
if anybody found out about this.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.404
This never happened.
We never spoke.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.371
Scout's honor.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.706
Okay.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.208
The guy you're looking for--

02:20.241 --> 02:21.375
the one from Vacaville Prison--

02:21.409 --> 02:22.376
I know who he is.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.578
You do.

02:24.612 --> 02:25.713
Well-- do you know where he is?

02:25.746 --> 02:27.648
No, not exactly.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.284
I work for ICE,
processing deportations.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.220
Today I open a file,
and there's the guy

02:32.253 --> 02:33.654
you're looking for,
staring back at me.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.523
His name's Tomas Estrada.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.259
Wait a minute. Did-did you
just say "deportations?"

02:38.292 --> 02:39.493
Yeah. He was sent
back to Guatemala

02:39.527 --> 02:41.495
a few weeks after he
went to the prison.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.331
You're-you're sure
that this is him?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.399
'Cause no one's been able
to ID him.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.700
Yeah. Oh, actually,
I've got a photo here.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.436
Two, actually.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.407
Yeah. See, he used to look
a lot different.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.808
I think that's why
nobody made the connection.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.544
Somebody must have
cleaned him up

02:56.577 --> 02:58.312
before he went to that prison.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.613
ANTHONY: The other mugshot's
from Hayward PD.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.416
He had three felony priors
for selling cocaine.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.353
The most recent bust was at some
bar out there called Alhambra's.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.556
Alhambra's. Okay, listen,
Anthony, thank you.

03:08.589 --> 03:09.757
Yeah, yeah, of course, any time.
Good luck.

03:17.365 --> 03:20.468
Greatest. Car chase. Ever.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.470
Dude, seriously?
Yeah.

03:22.503 --> 03:23.504
Have you seen
French Connection?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.506
Okay, fine, it's a tie.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.309
But Bullitt is an all-time
classic San Francisco movie.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.411
Really?
Really!

03:30.444 --> 03:32.313
Vertigo is a classic
San Francisco movie.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.448
The Conversation is
a classic San Francisco movie.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.484
Bullitt?

03:36.517 --> 03:37.785
What is it even about,
can you tell me?

03:37.818 --> 03:39.553
(phone buzzing)
Yes, I can.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.690
The answer is Steve McQueen
in a '68 Mustang GT.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.658
(phone buzzing)
Look, I am objectively
right about this,

03:44.692 --> 03:46.694
but I totally respect
your right to be wrong.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.796
Uh-huh.
(phone buzzing)

03:48.829 --> 03:50.798
Dude, who is
blowing you up?

03:50.831 --> 03:53.567
You got, like, 15 texts
since we left the theater.

03:53.601 --> 03:54.802
It's nothing.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.604
Aw, ya got some booty calls?

03:56.637 --> 03:58.372
Shouldn't they be called
"booty texts"?

03:58.406 --> 03:59.673
People don't really call
for booty anymore.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.409
I mean, I still call for booty,

04:01.442 --> 04:02.510
but no one ever picks up.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.416
LIZZIE:
Oh, my God...

04:08.449 --> 04:09.617
What the hell happened here?

04:09.650 --> 04:11.785
LIZZIE:
They went through everything.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.789
Lizzie, I think we should go.

04:15.823 --> 04:16.857
No, Tariq, these are

04:16.890 --> 04:19.760
all pictures of me.

04:19.793 --> 04:23.431
Every single one of these
is a picture of me.

04:23.464 --> 04:26.634
Tariq, somebody has been
following me for weeks.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.602
This was last week.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.442
Let me take you
out of here.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.344
We'll get you somewhere safe,
we'll call the cops on the way.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.379
Cops aren't going
to do anything.

04:38.412 --> 04:41.315
Do you see this place?
What are they gonna do?

04:41.349 --> 04:43.384
I know one who will.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.686
We've got a patrol unit
at the scene.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.621
Sweeping for prints,
canvassing the area,

04:47.655 --> 04:49.723
but for now, we don't got
much to go on.

04:49.757 --> 04:50.891
So where does that leave us?

04:50.924 --> 04:52.426
CAVANAUGH:
Something like this--

04:52.460 --> 04:54.395
stalking and harassment--

04:54.428 --> 04:55.663
it's usually someone
the victim knows.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.632
Angry ex, jealous lover
that sort of thing.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.368
Look, I don't want to put you
on the spot, Ms. Moore,

05:00.401 --> 05:02.336
but is there someone like that
we should be looking at?

05:02.370 --> 05:03.303
I don't think so.

05:04.271 --> 05:04.304
My last ex took a while
to get over things,

05:05.272 --> 05:06.707
but I haven't heard
from him in months.

05:07.808 --> 05:08.809
So you can't think of
who might have done this?

05:09.677 --> 05:11.779
Actually, there could be
a lot of people.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.347
Take a look at
these messages.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.717
"Your feminazi agenda

05:16.750 --> 05:17.885
"must be stopped.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.520
You better pray
I don't find you."

05:19.553 --> 05:21.389
"You're too ugly to rape.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.392
Getting rid of you would
be doing the world a favor."

05:24.425 --> 05:26.527
Oh, my God. Why would anyone
send these to you?

05:26.560 --> 05:27.461
I have a blog.

05:27.495 --> 05:28.862
May I?

05:30.731 --> 05:32.766
It's about dating
in the digital age.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.435
I post the worst messages

05:34.468 --> 05:36.404
that men send
on dating apps.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.905
It's called "Bro Means No."

05:37.938 --> 05:39.773
What kind of messages?

05:39.807 --> 05:41.842
LIZZIE:
Oh, requests for naked selfies,

05:41.875 --> 05:45.546
guys sending us
photos of their junk.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.748
Cursing us out because we won't
go on dates with them.

05:47.781 --> 05:48.849
Stuff like that.
TARIQ: I've seen
some of it.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.851
It's... really disturbing.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.386
And you think
these death threats

05:52.420 --> 05:53.554
are because of your blog?

05:53.587 --> 05:54.822
Oh, no, I'm sure of it.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.857
I always got
disturbing comments,

05:56.890 --> 05:59.993
but then "a few"
turned into "hundreds."

06:00.027 --> 06:03.731
And then I started getting
e-mails and texts, too.

06:03.764 --> 06:04.965
Why didn't you tell me
any of this?

06:04.998 --> 06:06.434
I don't know.
I mean, why would I?

06:06.467 --> 06:08.602
Getting threats
on a feminist blog

06:08.636 --> 06:10.604
is not new or shocking.

06:10.638 --> 06:13.006
But texts and e-mails are.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.608
It was all online,
so it didn't feel real.

06:14.642 --> 06:15.876
But this is...

06:15.909 --> 06:17.611
It's okay.

06:17.645 --> 06:20.013
CAVANAUGH: Well, we don't have
much to go on,

06:20.047 --> 06:21.749
but I promise you,
I'll do the best I can.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.618
But honestly,
this sounds more about

06:24.652 --> 06:26.587
an online stalking
than a break-in.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.589
Which means
it's a case for Sophe.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.491
Right.
I will get on this tonight.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.760
Thank you, Detective.
(phone beeps off)

06:32.793 --> 06:35.629
Have you saved all of
the threats you've received?

06:35.663 --> 06:37.565
I have a whole folder
on my phone.

06:37.598 --> 06:38.832
Good. Send
it to me.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.901
You really think you can
find who did this?

06:40.934 --> 06:42.636
Well, we're certainly
going to try.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.638
I'll find the IP addresses
of the commenters.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.040
No, Tariq, I think it's best
if you be with your friend.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.742
Do you have
a safe place to stay tonight?

06:48.776 --> 06:49.943
Oh, I'll be fine.

06:49.977 --> 06:50.944
You could stay at my place.

06:51.812 --> 06:52.813
Oh, you mean
your parents' place?

06:53.647 --> 06:54.548
Okay, I'm working
on my own place.

06:55.516 --> 06:55.549
LIZZIE: Mmm.
It's just a bit of a process.

06:55.949 --> 06:56.717
For my mom.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.552
(indistinct chatter,
thunder rumbles)

07:07.094 --> 07:08.862
(rock music playing loudly)

07:15.569 --> 07:16.804
Hey. How's it going?
You seen anything...

07:16.837 --> 07:19.873
Uh... Tomas Estrada?

07:21.909 --> 07:24.745
Haven't.
Okay, clearly haven't seen him.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.680
Excuse me.

07:26.714 --> 07:29.517
Uh... No, it's...
it's fine.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.084
*

07:31.118 --> 07:32.720
(clears throat)
Excuse me.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.858
Excuse me.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.793
Can I help you?
Yes, I hope so.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.062
There's a guy that used to
hang out here, Tomas Estrada?

07:42.095 --> 07:43.897
I got...

07:43.931 --> 07:45.666
Maybe...

07:45.699 --> 07:47.801
the name rings a bell?

07:47.835 --> 07:49.970
Think maybe you want
to order a drink

07:50.003 --> 07:51.639
before you start
asking for favors.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.873
I'll order
whatever you want,

07:52.906 --> 07:54.708
if you give me some information.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.510
MAN: Cirillo.
I've got this.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.049
What did Tomas do now?

08:02.082 --> 08:03.584
That's what
I'm trying to figure out, man.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.619
Is this...?

08:05.653 --> 08:07.588
All right, but not in here.

08:07.621 --> 08:08.722
Two many little birdies
listening.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.892
Thank you.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.728
*

08:14.762 --> 08:16.129
Thanks for taking the time
to talk to me, man.

08:16.163 --> 08:16.930
I really appreciate...

08:18.632 --> 08:20.000
Tomas?

08:20.033 --> 08:22.102
Sorry, never heard of him.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.038
And do yourself
a favor.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.807
Don't come back.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.682
I don't know what's happening;
it keeps freezing.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.050
It's a new phone, as well,
so it shouldn't be doing that.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.019
I am sorry that I don't have
anything more to offer.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.788
If Tariq had given me
some warning

08:40.821 --> 08:42.022
that we were having company...

08:42.055 --> 08:43.624
Mom, I told you,

08:43.657 --> 08:44.892
her apartment lost power.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.026
This wasn't, like,
a planned thing.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.628
He could have called.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.029
This is perfect, Mrs. Bakari,

08:49.062 --> 08:50.163
thank you so much.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.932
And I'm sorry to put you out.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.667
No, no, you are no
trouble, Lizzie.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.736
My darling son,
on the other hand...

08:57.671 --> 08:58.538
TARIQ:
So good.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.676
Uh, Tariq, can I talk to you
for a moment?

09:02.710 --> 09:03.777
It's the...

09:03.811 --> 09:04.912
printer.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.747
It's not connecting
to the Wi-Fi.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.749
I just fixed that yesterday.
And the day before that.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.684
Just have a look at it.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.920
All right,
what's wrong with it?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.922
Look, uh, you
know your mother

09:14.955 --> 09:17.791
and I try to be cool.
(chuckles)

09:17.825 --> 09:19.192
But you have
to understand,

09:19.226 --> 09:20.794
if you bring your
girlfriend home...

09:20.828 --> 09:22.796
Dad, she's not my girlfriend.

09:22.830 --> 09:23.964
How many times
do we have to go over this?

09:23.997 --> 09:25.032
She's just a friend.

09:25.966 --> 09:26.867
It's fine
if she's your girlfriend.

09:27.635 --> 09:28.969
You don't have
to lie about it.

09:29.002 --> 09:32.039
But you do have to sleep
on the couch.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.040
Okay, I'm not lying.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.207
And, yes, either way,

09:34.241 --> 09:37.110
I will sleep on the couch. Okay?

09:37.144 --> 09:40.013
Okay, good. And it's really
not working, by the way.
I'll fix it tomorrow.

09:40.047 --> 09:43.817
The sheets
on Tariq's bed are clean.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.185
You'll be sleeping
in his room tonight.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.220
(walkie-talkie buzz)
What was that?

09:47.254 --> 09:48.956
I don't know.

09:48.989 --> 09:52.125
(overlapping shouting)

09:54.795 --> 09:55.896
Hands! Show me your hands!

09:55.929 --> 09:57.831
Show me your hands!
Get on the ground!

09:57.865 --> 09:59.700
Get on the
ground! Down!

09:59.733 --> 10:01.902
*

10:12.880 --> 10:13.180
We haven't done
anything wrong.
Dad, you're not helping.

10:13.781 --> 10:14.181
I just want him to explain

10:14.915 --> 10:15.348
why they're doing this to us.

10:15.949 --> 10:16.616
I'll give you one guess.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.388
Detective Cavanaugh.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.422
We about done here?

10:22.455 --> 10:24.024
Roll up! Let's go!

10:24.057 --> 10:26.293
Thanks.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.230
CAVANAUGH:
Mr. and Mrs. Bakari,

10:30.263 --> 10:34.234
I apologize for the mistake.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.169
I just don't understand. What do
they think we were doing?

10:36.203 --> 10:38.205
CAVANAUGH: They got a
911 call from someone

10:38.238 --> 10:40.407
saying they saw a
"foreign-looking man,"

10:40.440 --> 10:43.010
wearing explosives, forcing
a woman into the house.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.244
So we were swatted?

10:44.277 --> 10:46.046
"Swatted"?
What is swatted?

10:46.079 --> 10:49.116
It means somebody called in
a fake crime

10:49.149 --> 10:50.884
so the SWAT team would come
to our house.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.319
But why us?

10:52.352 --> 10:54.421
Is this some kind of
anti-Muslim thing?

10:54.454 --> 10:57.157
Sir, we can't say that,
but we're looking into it.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.225
LIZZIE:
No, it's not.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.060
It's-it's my fault.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.328
I'm not staying here because
my apartment lost power.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.997
I'm staying here
because...

11:05.999 --> 11:07.467
...I'm staying here because
someone's been stalking me,

11:07.500 --> 11:09.202
and they broke into
my place tonight,

11:09.236 --> 11:12.072
and apparently, they
did this and I'm sorry.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.207
I am so sorry.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.909
Tariq, why would you lie to us?

11:15.943 --> 11:16.877
'Cause I knew you'd freak out.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.245
We would not "freak out."

11:18.278 --> 11:19.379
Mom, you freak out
about everything I do.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.014
Maybe if everything you did
wasn't so worrisome,

11:21.581 --> 11:22.249
we wouldn't freak out.

11:23.116 --> 11:23.851
LIZZIE: Look, I'm sorry
that we lied.

11:24.885 --> 11:24.918
It's my fault. It's
not Tariq's fault.

11:25.853 --> 11:25.886
CAVANAUGH: No, the only
person at fault here

11:26.787 --> 11:27.955
is the one that's
doing this to you

11:28.521 --> 11:28.922
and we will find him.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.491
Is it safe to stay here tonight?

11:31.524 --> 11:32.960
Yeah, but I'll keep a unit
out front of your house

11:32.993 --> 11:34.027
just in case.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.029
Try to get some sleep.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.201
Hey.

11:41.234 --> 11:44.004
Thank you.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.373
I'm not even gonna
say anything sarcastic.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.507
That's how much
I appreciate you right now.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.443
Thanks.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.179
But next time take off
your shoes in the house.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.380
Show some respect.

11:56.516 --> 12:00.520
* Can't somebody tell me *

12:00.553 --> 12:04.892
* What's going on around here? *

12:10.297 --> 12:13.133
* Oh, yeah

12:13.166 --> 12:17.938
* Can't somebody tell me *

12:17.971 --> 12:20.540
* What's going on around here? *

12:20.573 --> 12:23.310
We're closed.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.278
You got some kind of
death wish or something?

12:25.312 --> 12:28.181
You know, the thought
has crossed my mind,

12:28.215 --> 12:31.018
but no,
not at this exact moment.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.053
Then you better go.

12:33.086 --> 12:36.156
'Cause my boss is gonna be here
any second and if he sees you,

12:36.189 --> 12:38.158
ain't gonna be
your choice anymore.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.226
Well, you know what,
I'll take my chances

12:39.259 --> 12:44.064
'cause my daughter was
murdered last year, so...

12:44.097 --> 12:46.333
your boss can do
whatever he wants,

12:46.366 --> 12:48.035
it doesn't really
matter to me.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.436
You get me?

12:49.469 --> 12:51.504
What do you want?

12:51.538 --> 12:53.273
Tomas Estrada.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.042
I think he has some information

12:55.075 --> 12:57.177
that could lead
to my daughter's murderer.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.179
Don't you have some
kind of magic computer

12:59.212 --> 13:02.015
that can just do
all of this for you?

13:02.049 --> 13:03.483
Yeah, I know who you are.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.986
It's not magic.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.454
It's just people.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.489
And it led me here.

13:09.522 --> 13:13.360
So I'm asking you, please...

13:13.393 --> 13:16.429
Look, man, I barely knew
the guy, okay?

13:18.498 --> 13:21.568
But I know he lived with
his cousin over in San Leandro.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.236
So how do I find this cousin?

13:23.270 --> 13:25.072
You don't,

13:25.105 --> 13:28.075
not unless he tells me
he wants to be found.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.214
Give me a number.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.983
He'll call you if he has
anything to say.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.454
* Oh, yeah...

13:41.488 --> 13:44.224
(sighs)

13:49.062 --> 13:50.397
(cell phone buzzes)

13:59.406 --> 14:00.507
CAVANAUGH:
Hey.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.574
You guys have any luck here?

14:01.608 --> 14:03.043
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.244
Did not need to see this.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.245
Not this early
in the morning, not ever.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.647
We have uploaded
all the threats

14:07.680 --> 14:09.416
that Lizzie received
and by analyzing

14:09.449 --> 14:11.484
the content and
the time stamps,

14:11.518 --> 14:13.653
our users have made some
very interesting discoveries.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.423
Over the past four days,
you've gotten 63, no,

14:16.456 --> 14:19.392
64 messages saying, "Your an
ugly bitch who should be dead."

14:19.426 --> 14:21.161
Oh, that's pure poetry.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.362
JOSH: Thing is,
they appear to be

14:22.395 --> 14:25.265
from 64 separate accounts,
but they're all identical,

14:25.298 --> 14:27.367
down to the same
misspelling of "you're."

14:27.400 --> 14:30.237
So it's like someone's
been cutting and pasting?
JOSH: Exactly.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.172
So even though you've received
thousands of threats,

14:32.205 --> 14:33.173
they may have
only been generated

14:33.206 --> 14:34.574
by a handful of people.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.409
Users are going through your
blog trying to figure out

14:36.443 --> 14:37.677
if it's some of the men
you've posted about.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.479
Well, they can try, but...

14:39.512 --> 14:42.282
I don't reveal
anyone's identity.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.551
The blog isn't
about shaming individual men.

14:44.584 --> 14:48.521
It's about showing how
depressingly common misogyny is.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.324
I get respecting
their privacy,

14:51.358 --> 14:54.161
but if one of these guys
is your stalker,

14:54.194 --> 14:55.562
we need to know who he is.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.397
And I honestly wish
I can tell you,

14:57.430 --> 14:59.299
but most of my posts are
anonymous submissions.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.101
I don't even know
most of the men.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.469
(evidence alert beeping)
JOSH:
Hey, you guys.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.237
I think there might be
another way. Come here.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.572
CAVANAUGH:
So, wait a minute.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.440
You were answering an ad?

15:07.474 --> 15:09.209
Yeah, online.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.710
I take digital workforce jobs
sometimes

15:10.743 --> 15:13.346
to make a little extra cash.
Digital what?

15:13.380 --> 15:16.583
Uh, it's an online
crowdsourcing marketplace.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.151
They're just, like,
quick jobs that can be done

15:18.185 --> 15:19.719
sort of piecemeal
by a bunch of people.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.454
Okay, I get it,
I get it.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.490
Anyway, a-a few weeks ago,

15:23.523 --> 15:26.459
I saw this job posting
for leaving comments on a blog.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.661
Pretty standard stuff,
so I applied.

15:28.695 --> 15:32.499
But whoever it was wanted people
to leave these really awful,

15:32.532 --> 15:34.301
threatening comments.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.636
Obviously,
I didn't go through with it.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.371
But I guess other people did.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.739
SARA: Do you remember
the screen name

15:39.772 --> 15:41.341
of the person that
posted the job?

15:41.374 --> 15:44.211
Yeah. "Chaos756."

15:44.244 --> 15:45.678
That was his
e-mail address, too.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.280
Does that name mean
anything to you?

15:47.314 --> 15:49.382
No, I don't think so.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.683
Do you still have
the e-mails he sent?

15:50.717 --> 15:52.752
Yeah, and
the original post, too.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.487
I'll send them over.
SARA:
Thank you, Taylor.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.622
Hey.
Tariq, stop.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.257
I said I'm fine.
Don't be crazy.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.159
Would you let somebody
help you for once, please?

15:59.192 --> 16:00.427
I-I don't need any help.
What do you mean you
don't need any help?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.694
People need help
sometimes. I need help.

16:02.962 --> 16:02.996
No, I don't. I don't.
Ah, I don't
really need help.

16:03.696 --> 16:03.730
Hey, uh, Detective.
Tariq.

16:04.664 --> 16:05.732
Lizzie would like
to go home and change,

16:06.733 --> 16:07.367
but I told her
she shouldn't go back there

16:08.235 --> 16:09.236
without some protection.
And I told him

16:10.403 --> 16:10.670
that you have done
more than enough.
And I told her

16:11.971 --> 16:12.005
that we are tax-paying citizens
and you're just doing your job

16:13.006 --> 16:14.274
and she doesn't need
to be a hero about this.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.243
Okay, okay, okay.
I don't need the replay.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.378
Come on. Your place is
on the way downtown.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.213
It's better safe than sorry.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.448
It's on the way downtown.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.615
CAVANAUGH:
You're coming, too.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.251
ALEX (over phone):
Solano County Hospital?

16:24.284 --> 16:25.685
What are you doing there?

16:25.718 --> 16:27.654
Carlos was bleeding internally.

16:27.687 --> 16:31.424
They had to move him to county
to have emergency surgery.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.760
Is he gonna be okay?
I don't know.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.728
I just got here,
but they said it's, like,

16:35.762 --> 16:37.264
a high-risk operation.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.466
Jeffrey, why are you
telling me this?

16:39.499 --> 16:41.234
Because you said that
you were in and I...

16:41.268 --> 16:43.570
look, if he doesn't make it,

16:43.603 --> 16:45.538
I don't want it to come
as a complete shock to you.

16:45.572 --> 16:49.209
Well, thank you
for letting me know.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.314
Was there something else?

16:54.347 --> 16:59.319
(sighs)

16:59.352 --> 17:00.653
No, that's it.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.422
That's it.

17:02.455 --> 17:06.626
All right, um,
I'll talk to you soon.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.295
Bye.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.432
You were right to have me
come here with you.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.367
I know.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.502
I think she doesn't want
to believe this guy

17:15.535 --> 17:16.736
could really hurt her, but...

17:18.805 --> 17:22.342
From the looks of this place...

17:22.375 --> 17:23.476
he wants to hurt her.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.745
(slight clatter)

17:27.347 --> 17:28.248
(slight clatter)

17:34.354 --> 17:35.522
(exhales)

17:37.757 --> 17:39.726
Come on, get it together,
Lizzie.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.362
Get it together.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.330
(slight clatter)

17:53.373 --> 17:54.541
(Lizzie screams)

17:54.574 --> 17:56.343
Oh, my God.
Lizzie.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.679
Move. Freeze!

17:59.712 --> 18:01.814
Lizzie, tell them
it's just me.
Put your hands up.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.550
Turn around.
Lizzie, please.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.420
Put your hands
on your head.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.289
Come on, man, I know her.

18:09.322 --> 18:12.325
Okay, help me out here, Corey.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.626
If you and Lizzie
broke up six months ago,

18:13.660 --> 18:16.629
and you...
you didn't do none of this,

18:16.663 --> 18:19.832
why we catch you lurking
around the house outside?

18:19.866 --> 18:22.635
Because I wanted
to know she was okay.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.737
I saw her case on Sophe and
I was worried about her.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.839
I mean, fine.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.808
We broke up.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.310
But I still care about her.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.445
And you thought
snooping in her windows

18:32.479 --> 18:33.680
was the best way
to show your concern?

18:33.713 --> 18:35.848
No, I just wanted
to see if she was home.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.385
So why didn't you just call her
like a normal person?

18:38.418 --> 18:39.386
I did, but she
wasn't picking up.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.720
And her doorbell's broken

18:40.753 --> 18:42.755
or at least it used to be, so
that's why I went around back.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.524
You see how that sounds
really creepy, right?
Okay, all-all right.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.593
Time-out, time-out.
Hey, oh...
TARIQ: You get that?

18:46.626 --> 18:47.527
Now you think something
like this is gonna what?
One second.

18:48.595 --> 18:48.628
Get her in bed or something
again?
Okay, all right.

18:49.429 --> 18:49.462
All right, come on, man.
Am I right?

18:50.497 --> 18:51.664
You think this is, what?
CAVANAUGH: Hey, hey, hey.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.866
Yo, Corey. He's right.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.868
It does sound creepy.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.437
It was stupid to come here.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.938
I know that.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.542
But I would never hurt Lizzie.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.944
Where were you last night
between 6:00 and 10:00?

19:04.977 --> 19:07.680
I was at the Warriors game.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.516
Can you prove it?

19:09.549 --> 19:10.950
Yeah.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.420
I was there
with some of my boys.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.887
You could call them.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.590
Or better yet, I have
photos on my phone.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.626
You got photos?

19:19.659 --> 19:20.860
(under breath):
Yeah.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.438
COREY: You can check
the time stamp.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.440
I swear, I had nothing
to do with this.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.512
You really trust
this Cavanaugh guy?

19:39.546 --> 19:41.914
Yeah, actually, I do.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.717
How much does he know about you?

19:44.751 --> 19:46.853
What do you mean?

19:46.886 --> 19:48.855
I mean, last
time I checked,

19:48.888 --> 19:51.724
you're not exactly the
most law-abiding citizen.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.894
Or did you stop hacking when
you went to work for the man?

19:54.927 --> 19:57.764
You mean the man that's helping
find your stalker?

19:57.797 --> 20:00.833
Which I appreciate.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.470
I just don't want
to see you get brainwashed

20:03.503 --> 20:04.704
working
for the surveillance state.

20:04.737 --> 20:05.905
It's not like that.
Okay.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.447
Stay out of trouble, Corey.

20:19.519 --> 20:20.787
TARIQ:
What's up, dude?

20:20.820 --> 20:21.921
Keep walking.
Hey.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.690
LIZZIE:
Okay, I...

20:23.723 --> 20:24.924
I got this.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.029
Hey.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.432
Hey. You don't
really think

20:32.465 --> 20:33.800
I had anything
to do with this, do you?

20:33.833 --> 20:35.568
I don't know.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.670
I mean, I don't want
to think you did, but...

20:37.704 --> 20:40.573
Well, look, if there's
anything I can do,

20:40.607 --> 20:42.975
even if it's just somebody
to talk to, I'm here.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.912
I'm fine.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.447
Okay.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.951
Guess I'll see you
around then.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.431
(camera shutter clicking)

21:12.339 --> 21:14.006
Jeffrey. Hey.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.408
Hi.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.944
Hi. I didn't expect you
to come down here.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.979
I wasn't really expecting
to be here.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.013
How's it going?

21:21.047 --> 21:22.415
You know...

21:23.683 --> 21:25.518
What happened?

21:25.552 --> 21:27.387
Occupational... hazard.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.589
You work with computers.
I know.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.658
Yeah. Um,

21:31.691 --> 21:32.992
do you know anything
about Carlos,

21:33.025 --> 21:34.594
how he's doing,
what's going on...?

21:34.627 --> 21:36.929
Nothing yet.
He's, uh, he's been in there

21:36.963 --> 21:38.898
for about an hour,
so it's a waiting game.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.967
If he didn't do this,
if he didn't...

21:41.000 --> 21:43.636
kill Mia, and he dies because
of this, I don't know...

21:43.670 --> 21:45.872
Listen, you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.407
Of course I do.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.075
I sat in that courtroom

21:49.108 --> 21:51.378
thinking the most terrible
things about that kid...

21:51.411 --> 21:52.979
Because you thought
that he did it.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.448
And so did I.
And that's why I'm here.

21:55.482 --> 21:58.385
Look, all we
can hope for

21:58.418 --> 22:01.053
is that we get a chance
to make this right,

22:01.087 --> 22:02.088
(phone chimes)
that...

22:04.123 --> 22:06.092
I-I'm sorry, I have to go.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.927
What is...
Sorry. Hey, this is...
it's about all of this.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.362
It's about the guy

22:09.396 --> 22:11.964
who was paid to attack
Carlos, okay?

22:11.998 --> 22:13.400
So I will explain
it all later, trust me.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.568
If anything happens, call me.
No.

22:15.602 --> 22:18.571
Listen, if he... Just let
me know what happens.
Where are you going?

22:18.605 --> 22:20.440
(stammering):
Uh... just be...

22:20.473 --> 22:22.909
(scoffs)

22:22.942 --> 22:24.677
Can you help
me, please?

22:24.711 --> 22:26.379
M-My son,

22:26.413 --> 22:29.148
Carlos Ochoa, was taken
into emergency surgery.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.683
Is he okay?

22:32.919 --> 22:34.887
*

22:48.034 --> 22:49.669
You Tomas's cousin?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.438
(chuckles)
Well, that depends.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.972
What do you want?

22:53.005 --> 22:55.575
Tomas went
to Vacaville State Prison,

22:55.608 --> 22:57.677
told an inmate
to take out the guy

22:57.710 --> 23:00.447
who was accused
of killing my daughter.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.148
All right?
I just want to know why.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.017
For money.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.487
Why does anybody
do anything?

23:07.520 --> 23:09.422
That's a nice watch.

23:09.456 --> 23:12.492
I guess you know a thing or two
about doing things for money.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.494
You want this watch?

23:14.527 --> 23:16.529
You just tell me who paid him.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.498
Sorry.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.500
I can't help you with that.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.602
I stayed out of
Tomas's business.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.506
I got something else
you might want, though.

23:29.976 --> 23:33.112
I've got a security
camera on my place.

23:33.145 --> 23:34.614
Check this out.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.118
Somebody dropped three grand

23:39.151 --> 23:41.053
for Tomas on
the doorstep.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.755
You better believe
I'm gonna pay attention to that.

23:42.789 --> 23:43.756
Can I have this?

23:43.790 --> 23:46.092
Well, that depends.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.160
You want the watch?
No problem.

23:48.194 --> 23:51.998
Some money? I got about...
I got about a grand here,

23:52.031 --> 23:53.566
in cash. I...
Hey.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.202
I don't want your
cash or your watch.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.705
That your ride?

24:00.507 --> 24:02.208
No, that's... it's a loaner.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.676
Mine's in the shop.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.645
Do I look like I care?

24:08.114 --> 24:10.483
You got a charging station?

24:10.517 --> 24:12.719
I'll improvise.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.993
Got it.
Pleasure doing
business with you.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.565
Okay, I got it.

24:25.598 --> 24:28.701
The resolution's not very good.

24:28.735 --> 24:30.570
No, I...
Listen, just post it anyway.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.204
Maybe someone
can make something of it.

24:32.238 --> 24:34.541
And also, can you send me
a car, please?

24:34.574 --> 24:36.175
I seem to have
lost mine.

24:36.208 --> 24:39.111
Um... yeah, sure.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.113
Anything on Chaos756?
Users are submitting

24:41.147 --> 24:43.215
everything they can find
about his online presence.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.618
Whoever this guy is,
he's a real gem.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.186
Lot of sexist
hot takes on movies,

24:47.219 --> 24:49.589
a couple of obnoxious
restaurant reviews,

24:49.622 --> 24:52.859
and he mostly seems to hang out
at basketball and MMA forums.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.061
Wait, go back.
Which one?

24:55.094 --> 24:56.529
That one.

24:56.563 --> 24:58.164
"Yet another San Fran
establishment

24:58.197 --> 25:00.600
"ruining a burger
with nasty organic ketchup

25:00.633 --> 25:02.669
"and a sprouted wheat roll.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.303
"If I wanted to eat healthy,
I wouldn't be

25:04.336 --> 25:05.271
"ordering a burger.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.606
"Just give me Heinz

25:06.639 --> 25:07.674
"and a white bun.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.577
Is that so hard?"

25:10.610 --> 25:11.744
What's up?

25:11.778 --> 25:14.814
I know this rant.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.584
It's Corey.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.818
(sighs)

25:18.851 --> 25:20.553
It's Corey.

25:22.722 --> 25:23.723
Are you sure?

25:23.756 --> 25:26.125
Word for word.
So Corey is

25:26.158 --> 25:27.627
Chaos756 after all.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.629
Okay, I'll call Cavanaugh.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.097
(line ringing)

25:34.266 --> 25:36.836
Corey!
Open up! SFPD!

25:43.910 --> 25:45.144
(computer rings)

25:45.177 --> 25:46.646
Detective.

25:46.679 --> 25:47.780
Did you find Corey?

25:47.814 --> 25:49.649
CAVANAUGH:
Yeah, we found him.

25:49.682 --> 25:51.550
He's dead.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.759
God, it just keeps
getting worse.

25:59.792 --> 26:00.927
Last night I just
had a stalker,

26:00.960 --> 26:03.930
and now Corey is dead...

26:03.963 --> 26:05.164
maybe because of me.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.166
No, none of this is on you.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.301
Hey.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.238
Is that what
I think it is?
Corey's laptop.

26:12.271 --> 26:15.307
It's locked, but I figured
you could find the way in.
Do you have a warrant?

26:15.341 --> 26:16.743
Actually...
I'm kidding.
I don't need one.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.211
SARA:
Do we have any leads?

26:19.245 --> 26:21.180
We're running ballistics
and sweeping for prints,

26:21.213 --> 26:23.049
but nothing's
come back so far.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.051
I got Tariq
doing his thing

26:25.084 --> 26:27.053
on Corey's laptop.
I did a quick search

26:27.086 --> 26:28.120
of Corey's browsing history.

26:28.154 --> 26:29.756
It turns out he is indeed

26:29.789 --> 26:32.058
the mysterious Chaos756.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.926
It was a secondary
e-mail address.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.928
And this is the last
e-mail he received.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.330
It's from somebody
who calls himself DrChad89.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.933
SARA:
"Traitor"? So Corey

26:40.967 --> 26:43.936
was working with this...
DrChad89?

26:43.970 --> 26:47.239
That's what it looks like.
All right, let's get
this DrChad89 up on Sophe

26:47.273 --> 26:50.342
and see if anyone
recognizes his e-mail.
On it.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.111
I'm guessing his name's not Chad
and he's not really a doctor.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.914
LIZZIE: So what, this guy
saw Corey talking to me,

26:54.947 --> 26:57.784
and he decided to kill him?

26:57.817 --> 26:59.852
This is insane.

26:59.886 --> 27:01.220
Well, yeah, this guy
is clearly insane.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.856
It's just that...
Here, look.

27:03.890 --> 27:06.192
Corey replied to his e-mail,
and he said if DrChad89

27:06.225 --> 27:08.294
didn't leave you
alone, he'd go back

27:08.327 --> 27:09.762
to the police and
tell them everything.

27:09.796 --> 27:10.763
What was "everything"?

27:10.797 --> 27:12.865
So glad you asked.
DrChad replied

27:12.899 --> 27:15.001
to one of Corey's
digital workforce postings.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.303
The same one Taylor saw?
Exactly.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.305
DrChad had something else
on his mind, though.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.841
See, sending threats wasn't
enough for him-- he's the one

27:21.874 --> 27:23.375
who decided to bring it
into the real world,

27:23.409 --> 27:24.977
and to stalk you,

27:25.011 --> 27:26.112
and to break into
your apartment.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.280
And to swat your house.
Exactly.

27:28.314 --> 27:31.851
Corey played along at first, but
after his run-in with Cavanaugh,

27:31.884 --> 27:33.853
I guess he'd had enough.
LIZZIE:
I don't get it.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.254
Why would Corey do all of this

27:35.287 --> 27:37.256
and then come to my place
acting all concerned?

27:37.289 --> 27:39.158
To play the hero.
Because he's pathetic.

27:39.191 --> 27:42.028
Look, all right. Now, can you
find out who this DrChad is

27:42.061 --> 27:43.262
from his e-mail
address?
No.

27:43.295 --> 27:44.396
His account data's all fake,

27:44.430 --> 27:45.998
and he used a VPN.
All right,

27:46.032 --> 27:47.366
call me as soon as you find

27:47.399 --> 27:49.001
any ID on this guy.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.302
Will do.
JOSH:
Hey, guys?

27:50.336 --> 27:52.004
I think you're gonna
want to see this.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.405
What is it?
The crowd's
already submitting

27:53.439 --> 27:55.407
anything they can find
on DrChad's online presence.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.076
He spends most of his time

27:57.109 --> 27:58.410
on men's rights forums.

27:58.444 --> 28:00.279
The old He-Man
Woman Hater's Club.

28:00.312 --> 28:01.914
"Only cucks let feminazis

28:01.948 --> 28:02.915
"dictate to them.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.083
"Real men are the victims

28:04.116 --> 28:05.084
"of feminist culture.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.152
"Just look at suicide rates

28:06.185 --> 28:07.286
"and homelessness rates.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.255
It's time to take
our power back."

28:09.288 --> 28:11.924
So he's some kind of
misogynist zealot.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.160
And thanks to Corey, all this
rage is being pointed at you.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.828
TANNER:
What's going on, everyone?

28:15.862 --> 28:16.929
Look alive. Megan.

28:17.964 --> 28:18.664
Really good work last night.
That was a great tip.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.132
Thank you, Mr. Tanner. I'm...

28:21.100 --> 28:21.868
What's happening
with the security footage?

28:22.735 --> 28:23.903
You got a name?
JOSH: Uh, just a second.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.872
The video's been viewed

28:25.905 --> 28:28.975
by about 5,000 users,
but no one's recognized her yet.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.242
We need it front and center,
all right?

28:30.276 --> 28:30.943
That's what needs
to be happening.

28:30.977 --> 28:32.178
Well, we're kind of working

28:33.045 --> 28:33.345
on a case now, too.
That's great.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.014
Let's use that,
okay? We can use

28:36.082 --> 28:37.249
the security footage and
just link it up and put it

28:38.284 --> 28:38.918
on every case page--
the more eyes, the better.

28:39.351 --> 28:40.920
Yeah, but we...

28:40.953 --> 28:41.854
Jeffrey?

28:45.958 --> 28:46.826
Jeffrey?

28:48.961 --> 28:50.930
I'm sorry, I was...
I've been a selfish jerk.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.164
What happened to you?

28:52.198 --> 28:54.366
Believe it or not,
I got into a bar fight.

28:54.400 --> 28:59.371
Yeah. But... honest to God,
you should see the other guy.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.173
Oh, well, I imagine
he looks worse?
Oh, no,

29:01.207 --> 29:02.274
you should see him
'cause he's huge.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.110
I think you'd be very impressed
that I walked away

29:05.311 --> 29:06.979
with just this.
Don't you dare try
and make me smile,

29:07.013 --> 29:08.414
Jeffrey Tanner.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.383
I came in here to tell you

29:11.417 --> 29:13.219
that you are being a...

29:13.252 --> 29:15.121
What did you just call yourself?

29:15.154 --> 29:16.388
A selfish jerk.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.390
Yes, exactly.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.259
You can't treat
people this way,

29:20.292 --> 29:22.261
and you can't just
disappear on us

29:22.294 --> 29:24.096
without telling us
where you are.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.464
We were worried
about you.

29:25.497 --> 29:27.900
We needed you.

29:27.934 --> 29:31.003
Tariq needed you.

29:31.037 --> 29:33.372
One of his best friends is in
literal life-threatening danger

29:33.405 --> 29:35.041
right now.
I am glad

29:35.074 --> 29:36.943
that Sophe is helping,
all right?

29:36.976 --> 29:39.045
But I have a lead now

29:39.078 --> 29:41.047
on something that could lead
to Mia's killer,

29:41.080 --> 29:43.015
and that is why we built this.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.251
And-and this will always be
my priority.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.453
Yes, you made that very clear
when we broke up.

29:47.486 --> 29:48.420
Sara, come on.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.521
Th-That...

29:49.555 --> 29:51.958
video is out there.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.260
There's nothing else

29:54.293 --> 29:56.428
that you can do about it
right now.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.231
But there is a lot
that you can do for Tariq.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.937
(evidence alert blaring)

30:09.942 --> 30:13.145
What the hell is this?

30:13.179 --> 30:15.147
SARA:
"I know where you are.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.416
Nobody can protect you."

30:17.449 --> 30:19.151
(taps screen)
It's from him.
DrChad89.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.552
The account was created
ten minutes ago,

30:20.586 --> 30:22.021
but it's all fake
account info.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.155
Can you get
into the metadata,

30:23.189 --> 30:24.991
figure out
where it originates from?

30:25.024 --> 30:26.325
Oh. Your face, it looks bad.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.060
TARIQ (chuckles):
Ouch. Whoa.

30:28.094 --> 30:29.561
TANNER:
What's happening here?
JOSH: Oh. Right.

30:29.595 --> 30:32.331
These DrChad89 posts
just keep coming.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.333
I have reports of death
threats and cyberstalking

30:34.366 --> 30:36.535
from 20 women
and counting.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.337
A lot of them
are similar to Lizzie.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.139
Break-ins, swatting,
stalker photos--

30:40.172 --> 30:41.573
but none of them can figure out

30:41.607 --> 30:42.841
who's behind the screen name.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.511
So we're dealing with someone
who knows what they're doing

30:45.544 --> 30:47.379
and knows how
to stay hidden.

30:47.413 --> 30:49.081
Which means that...

30:49.115 --> 30:51.383
we need to figure out a way
to draw him out.

30:53.085 --> 30:55.554
TARIQ:
What are you doing?

30:55.587 --> 30:58.290
I'm leaving.
Whoa, slow down.
No, you're not.

30:58.324 --> 30:59.491
Yeah, I am. I'm
going to New York

30:59.525 --> 31:01.460
to stay with my sister
until this is over.

31:01.493 --> 31:04.430
No, Lizzie, you can't.
You don't get
to tell me what

31:04.463 --> 31:06.465
I can and can't do, Tariq.
I'm not gonna
tell you what to do,

31:06.498 --> 31:09.335
but leaving now isn't safe.
Oh, and staying here is?

31:09.368 --> 31:11.103
We tried this your
way-- Corey's dead.

31:11.137 --> 31:13.372
And if I stay here, I'm
gonna get you killed, too.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.074
He's sending me pictures of us.
Or you can

31:15.107 --> 31:17.109
get yourself killed
if you leave. You're n...

31:17.143 --> 31:19.111
you're not thinking straight.
I'm not

31:19.145 --> 31:20.546
just gonna sit here
and do nothing

31:20.579 --> 31:23.182
and hope that the
cops can fix this.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.483
You of all people
should know that.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.618
Sorry, but I don't.

31:26.652 --> 31:29.355
What happened
to the Tariq I knew?

31:29.388 --> 31:31.123
The one who hacked
the Pentagon?

31:31.157 --> 31:32.624
The one who didn't trust cops?

31:32.658 --> 31:34.360
I guess he grew up.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.495
And now, he's just
trying to help you.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.397
You know, when you say "grow
up," it really sounds like

31:38.430 --> 31:40.499
"give up."

31:40.532 --> 31:43.169
Do you remember in sixth grade,

31:43.202 --> 31:46.505
the first time you tried
to sit with me at lunch?

31:46.538 --> 31:48.440
You told me that
I smelled funny,

31:48.474 --> 31:52.244
and then you refused to
say another word to me.

31:52.278 --> 31:55.114
Because back then, I was this
shy kid with a funny accent,

31:55.147 --> 31:56.582
thick glasses,

31:56.615 --> 31:58.150
and a religion
all our classmates

31:58.184 --> 32:00.252
were pretty much afraid of.

32:00.286 --> 32:02.154
Zero grasp of American culture.

32:02.188 --> 32:03.422
I spent four months
in a new country,

32:03.455 --> 32:05.424
at a new school,
being tormented.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.293
Literally, no kid had said more

32:07.326 --> 32:09.261
than three words to me without
it turning into ridicule.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.530
So that day, when you
randomly asked to sit with me,

32:11.563 --> 32:14.266
I thought it was some part
of, like, a long con

32:14.300 --> 32:15.601
that would end up with me

32:15.634 --> 32:18.304
getting my ass kicked
by the lockers.

32:18.337 --> 32:21.140
I was so scared and angry
that I couldn't see

32:21.173 --> 32:23.109
that you were just...

32:23.142 --> 32:26.278
you were just a cool person
trying to be my friend.

32:26.312 --> 32:29.481
So I was a jerk to you.

32:29.515 --> 32:32.418
And I think that's
what's going on right now.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.685
You have so much hate
being thrown at you

32:33.719 --> 32:35.554
that you can't see that I'm...

32:35.587 --> 32:39.125
I'm just trying
to be your friend.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.331
Well, uh-- that's a pretty
obvious analogy.

32:45.364 --> 32:47.199
(laughs softly)

32:49.401 --> 32:50.502
(sighs)

32:54.206 --> 32:56.542
Does this mean you think
I'm being a jerk to you?

32:56.575 --> 32:58.444
You're pretty good at it.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.646
Sorry. I'm just...

33:00.679 --> 33:01.647
Terrified.
Yeah.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.482
Yeah, I know.

33:03.515 --> 33:06.285
That's why we're all here
trying to help you.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.520
So let's just talk
to Cavanaugh and Tanner,

33:08.554 --> 33:11.190
and we'll come up with a plan.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.226
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

33:25.471 --> 33:27.206
Um, Mrs. Ochoa?

33:27.239 --> 33:29.675
I got you a coffee.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.647
Thought you could use one.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.154
Would you mind if I sat
next to you, or...?

33:58.170 --> 33:59.571
You know, um...

33:59.605 --> 34:04.443
the last time, uh,
we saw each other,

34:04.476 --> 34:07.513
we were on opposite sides
of a courtroom,

34:07.546 --> 34:10.349
and...

34:10.382 --> 34:12.751
I was, um...

34:12.784 --> 34:15.754
accusing your son of the
worst possible crime.

34:19.325 --> 34:22.594
And to be honest,

34:22.628 --> 34:25.731
I'm not sure what
to think anymore.

34:30.236 --> 34:32.271
I just wanted
to say,

34:32.304 --> 34:34.440
um...

34:34.473 --> 34:36.575
that I'm sorry.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.382
I'm...

34:43.415 --> 34:44.716
I'm so, so...

34:44.750 --> 34:46.685
I'm so sorry.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.846
(siren wailing in distance)

35:14.880 --> 35:17.549
(phone ringing)

35:17.583 --> 35:19.418
Hey, Tariq.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.553
Yes, I told you, I'm fine.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.822
I'm just grabbing some stuff
before I head to the airport.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.295
Yes, I will text you
as soon as I get there.

35:29.328 --> 35:30.396
Bye.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.264
(phone beeps)

35:34.800 --> 35:36.602
Welcome home, you little whore.
(shouts)

35:38.604 --> 35:40.739
You think men are so pitiful?

35:40.772 --> 35:43.375
Let's see what you think

35:43.409 --> 35:44.610
when I give you
what you deserve.

35:46.412 --> 35:47.446
(gun clicks)

35:47.479 --> 35:48.614
CAVANAUGH:
Let her go.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.782
And put your hands up.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.521
You little bitch.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.658
You're gonna want to take
advantage of the right

35:59.691 --> 36:01.593
to remain silent.

36:01.627 --> 36:02.828
Get on your knees.

36:04.496 --> 36:05.564
10-25.

36:06.832 --> 36:07.899
(backpack clatters)

36:07.933 --> 36:10.336
(siren wails)

36:10.369 --> 36:12.871
(panting)

36:12.904 --> 36:15.641
Hey.
Hey.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.413
You okay?

36:21.447 --> 36:24.383
There was a moment, when I was
driving over here, that I almost

36:24.416 --> 36:26.518
changed my mind and went
straight to the airport.

36:26.552 --> 36:28.387
I don't blame you. That's the
most scared I've ever been.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.888
I was just in a police car.

36:29.921 --> 36:32.658
Well, we both know
I'm braver than you, so.

36:32.691 --> 36:33.725
Braver. Okay.
(chuckles)

36:44.770 --> 36:46.605
CAVANAUGH:
Hey.

36:46.638 --> 36:48.440
We ran DrChad's ID.

36:48.474 --> 36:49.708
His real name is Garrett Nash.

36:49.741 --> 36:50.876
That ring a bell?

36:50.909 --> 36:53.445
Multiple complaints

36:53.479 --> 36:55.647
of harassment, stalking,
a domestic charge.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.449
All the warning signs.

36:57.483 --> 36:58.450
But none of it ever stuck.

36:58.484 --> 36:59.951
If these charges
would have been taken seriously,

36:59.985 --> 37:01.820
none of this
would have ever happened.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.955
All the more reason to feel good
about what you did tonight.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.493
All right.

37:11.497 --> 37:12.864
Hey, Lizzie.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.401
Yeah.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.403
You want to know
what really happened?

37:17.436 --> 37:19.571
To the Tariq you knew?

37:19.605 --> 37:21.473
He didn't just grow up?

37:21.507 --> 37:24.743
He got busted by the Feds
for hacking the Pentagon.

37:24.776 --> 37:27.546
That thing you thought
was so cool?

37:27.579 --> 37:29.648
(sighs)

37:29.681 --> 37:31.583
My parents had to take out
a second mortgage on their house

37:31.617 --> 37:33.619
to pay the lawyers
who kept me out of prison.

37:33.652 --> 37:37.756
So I took this job so I can
start paying them back.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.991
At first, I thought it was
just a way to use my skills

37:40.025 --> 37:42.561
without selling out,
or whatever, but...

37:42.594 --> 37:44.796
I'll be honest,
I really like it.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.665
(laughs softly)

37:46.698 --> 37:49.000
I mean, we're doing
something good, you know?

37:51.603 --> 37:53.905
I mean, I'm not exactly in
a position to argue with that.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.507
Wait, I'm right?

37:55.541 --> 37:56.908
Awesome.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.644
(chuckles)
That's cool. Hey.

37:58.677 --> 37:59.645
You should come over
to my parents' place tonight.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.012
My mom felt super bad

38:01.046 --> 38:03.515
about last night,
so she made this huge spread.

38:03.549 --> 38:04.015
It's basically like
an Indian buffet.

38:04.750 --> 38:05.417
T-There's samosas and chickens.

38:06.017 --> 38:06.618
Plus,
you get the bonus

38:07.419 --> 38:07.753
of helping my dad
with the Wi-Fi.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.488
So much fun.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.056
Thank you.
(chuckles)

38:11.089 --> 38:14.926
I really do
appreciate it, but...

38:14.960 --> 38:17.062
I think I'm gonna
go to New York.

38:17.095 --> 38:18.664
See my sister,

38:18.697 --> 38:19.831
just get a change of scenery,

38:19.865 --> 38:21.900
get out of here for a minute.

38:21.933 --> 38:25.070
You're coming back
though, right?

38:25.103 --> 38:27.673
Well, somebody needs
to sit with you at lunch.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.541
(laughs softly)

38:29.575 --> 38:30.909
Tanner. What are you doing here?
TANNER:
Hey.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.645
I was, uh, just in
the neighborhood.

38:33.679 --> 38:34.946
I mean, seriously, they have...

38:34.980 --> 38:36.982
incredible burritos
in this area.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.684
Are you okay?

38:38.717 --> 38:39.885
Yeah. Thank you.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.687
Sure.
Thanks for your help.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.555
Your idea worked.

38:43.589 --> 38:44.990
Listen, it's the least
I can do, I just...

38:45.023 --> 38:46.825
wish I was there
from the beginning,

38:46.858 --> 38:47.959
and I'm sorry about that.

38:49.695 --> 38:50.829
You should go--
you should probably

38:50.862 --> 38:51.797
go see about that burrito.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.031
Yeah.
Yeah.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.600
The search
for the perfect burrito.

38:54.633 --> 38:55.501
TARIQ:
Right.

38:57.603 --> 38:58.870
TANNER:
Detective.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.106
Good work tonight.

39:01.139 --> 39:03.642
Yeah. A good team effort.
Yeah.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.577
So how you doing, chasing
down that Estrada lead?

39:05.611 --> 39:07.078
Anything?
No. Nothing yet.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.980
But, uh, we have
that security footage

39:09.014 --> 39:11.116
of the person making
that money drop.

39:11.149 --> 39:13.585
No one's recognized her yet,
so I was hoping

39:13.619 --> 39:16.121
that you could run her face
through your database.

39:16.154 --> 39:18.590
I mean, I'll try, but
if Sophe can't find her,

39:18.624 --> 39:20.826
I don't know how
much better I can do.
Yeah.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.728
All right, that's me.

39:22.761 --> 39:24.596
Well, send me the file,
I'll see what I can do.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.131
Okay, great. Thank you.

39:26.164 --> 39:27.933
Have a good night.
Yeah.

39:31.102 --> 39:33.104
Hey. Could you head
over to Oakland, please?

39:33.138 --> 39:34.573
Thank you.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.630
Uh...

39:58.664 --> 39:59.698
Excuse me, I-I said
we're going to Oakland,

39:59.731 --> 40:01.733
please, this is...

40:01.767 --> 40:03.902
S... What's go--
what's-what's going on here?

40:03.935 --> 40:04.803
Excuse me, this is my ride.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.638
Mr. Tanner.

40:06.672 --> 40:07.673
Who are you?

40:10.942 --> 40:14.179
MAN: I'm the man
you've been looking for.

40:14.212 --> 40:18.917
I'm the man who paid
Tomas Estrada to talk to Flaco.

40:18.950 --> 40:23.622
And I arranged for the money
drop on Tomas's porch, too.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.857
The thing you have
to realize, Mr. Tanner,

40:25.891 --> 40:28.059
is that these people
are nobodies.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.095
And that's why I hired them.

40:30.128 --> 40:33.198
But every time you put
one of their faces online,

40:33.231 --> 40:35.567
I have to make them disappear.

40:37.903 --> 40:39.738
And it's annoying.
Not to mention

40:39.771 --> 40:42.173
a terrible waste
of human resources, huh?

40:42.207 --> 40:43.842
Well, guess what?

40:43.875 --> 40:45.644
I don't really care

40:45.677 --> 40:48.079
about your employee
retention rate, all right?

40:48.113 --> 40:50.081
I'll be happy to take
those faces down

40:50.115 --> 40:52.183
if you tell me who
killed my daughter.

40:52.217 --> 40:54.953
So how about you help me
with that?

40:54.986 --> 40:56.722
Then we'll talk.

40:56.755 --> 40:59.224
Believe it or not,
I honestly wish I could.

40:59.257 --> 41:02.027
But I don't have the answers
you're looking for.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.129
I don't ever know who hires me.

41:04.162 --> 41:07.899
It's safer that way
for everyone.

41:07.933 --> 41:11.703
But what I do know...

41:11.737 --> 41:15.040
is that you're looking at this
from the wrong direction.

41:17.142 --> 41:20.111
Well,
what's the right direction?

41:20.145 --> 41:23.782
You should be starting
from the top.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.250
I'm not your enemy.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.986
I'm just a man doing a job.

41:28.019 --> 41:30.789
But my services
don't come cheap,

41:30.822 --> 41:33.825
so you have to ask yourself...

41:33.859 --> 41:36.728
what kind of a person
would have the resources

41:36.762 --> 41:38.664
to hire someone like me?

41:38.697 --> 41:41.733
Whoever it is...

41:41.767 --> 41:43.735
has deep pockets,

41:43.769 --> 41:47.939
just like you, Mr. Tanner.

41:47.973 --> 41:50.909
Why are you telling me this?

41:50.942 --> 41:53.178
Because I'm a father, too.

42:04.890 --> 42:07.258
TANNER:
What happens now?

42:07.292 --> 42:09.728
Now?

42:09.761 --> 42:11.697
Now you get out of my car.

42:12.798 --> 42:15.066
Good night, Mr. Tanner.
