00:52.470 --> 00:54.800
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck?

00:58.964 --> 01:01.324
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm a friend of your Mum's...

01:01.444 --> 01:03.635
I had nowhere to kip.
Sweetheart, isn't she?

01:03.755 --> 01:05.745
Even if she doesn't believe
I'm the actual messiah.

01:05.865 --> 01:07.680
Mum...! Mum!

01:11.320 --> 01:13.990
Who the hell does she think she is?
This is bloody ridiculous,

01:14.110 --> 01:15.989
does nobody understand privacy?

01:16.819 --> 01:17.819
I'm naked.

01:18.464 --> 01:19.993
I sleep naked.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.757
Nothing I haven't seen before.
You look like your mum, actually.

01:22.877 --> 01:25.080
You've even got
the same haircut she has.

01:29.194 --> 01:30.194
Mum!

01:31.191 --> 01:34.080
- I can see why you find it offensive...
- It's not just the shape,

01:34.425 --> 01:36.480
- it's the skin...
- It's a very aggressive texture.

01:37.029 --> 01:38.279
Positively patriarchal.

01:44.690 --> 01:46.040
Definitely patriarchal.

01:46.376 --> 01:47.376
Mum.

01:49.057 --> 01:51.760
Has anyone ever told you
what a complete fucking cow you are?

01:52.250 --> 01:54.151
Plenty of people.
Look at this would you, love?

01:54.271 --> 01:56.406
We're thinking of banning it
in the group shopping list.

01:56.526 --> 01:59.320
There's a man.
In my room. In my bed!

02:00.013 --> 02:02.720
He had nowhere else to go.
It's called communal living, sweetie...

02:03.218 --> 02:05.440
God! You're so... irritating!

02:14.124 --> 02:15.124
Kids...

02:15.685 --> 02:16.735
Immature...

03:04.612 --> 03:07.040
- I'm late. Am I late?
- Course not...

03:07.559 --> 03:09.423
Besides, this is hardly
an appointment is it?

03:09.543 --> 03:11.487
Kept behind by Cruella De Ville.

03:12.589 --> 03:14.626
And what did
the college director want?

03:14.746 --> 03:18.320
To send me on a motivation course...
The Feeling, Healing Teaching Programme.

03:18.877 --> 03:19.748
Fuck's sake!

03:19.868 --> 03:22.468
And guess what?
I fucking hate teaching!

03:25.683 --> 03:26.810
So, how's your Mum?

03:26.930 --> 03:29.264
Still saving the world
one lentil at a time?

03:29.384 --> 03:32.360
Well, you know... Sometimes she's up.
Sometimes she's down.

03:32.929 --> 03:36.000
Sometimes she's only half-way up,
which is neither up nor down.

03:37.479 --> 03:39.492
And the Mother Nature thing
is getting tired.

03:39.612 --> 03:42.920
I've got 15 people living in
my house, and none are paying rent!

03:44.992 --> 03:46.692
Still, can't be all bad.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.284
Made you, didn't she?

03:49.936 --> 03:52.558
Though apparently
Fred West's daughter's a charm.

03:52.678 --> 03:54.152
Hope for us all.

03:54.620 --> 03:56.960
Right so, that's me.
See you in assembly...

03:58.000 --> 03:59.960
Our glorious leader
has summoned us all.

04:00.651 --> 04:02.520
- You're gonna like this...
- Like what?

04:03.305 --> 04:05.880
You'll find out...
Just be there, missy.

04:35.479 --> 04:37.800
- What's going on there?
- Nothing.

04:38.699 --> 04:39.699
Shut up!

04:43.040 --> 04:44.785
Then you've got
the shaft of your penis...

05:08.613 --> 05:11.617
In ancient times before the now.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.877
There was an almighty blazing row.

05:14.997 --> 05:18.486
Between two kingdoms tall and proud.

05:19.392 --> 05:22.797
How to decide this without blood?

05:23.741 --> 05:26.039
Right, settle down everyone...

05:26.752 --> 05:28.041
Thank you, Doug,

05:28.668 --> 05:29.945
fascinating introduction.

05:30.065 --> 05:31.724
- But I'm not finished!
- Yes, you are!

05:31.844 --> 05:34.040
Let's put it to a vote!

05:35.361 --> 05:37.439
Bit of theatre, you know... Impact.

05:37.803 --> 05:39.165
OK, it's simple.

05:39.285 --> 05:41.185
We want a Student President.

05:42.299 --> 05:43.880
This will be a...

05:44.469 --> 05:46.753
democratically empowered position,

05:46.873 --> 05:48.414
for a talented individual,

05:48.534 --> 05:50.462
to proactively seek excellence

05:50.582 --> 05:53.360
in matters
of student representation.

05:54.986 --> 05:57.677
And you,
my little education consumers,

05:57.797 --> 06:00.477
will choose this president by vote.

06:01.208 --> 06:03.365
The election is next week
so if you wish to stand,

06:03.485 --> 06:05.240
please see Doug after assembly.

06:06.237 --> 06:07.387
Can I just...

06:07.507 --> 06:09.614
I've got a whole rhyme
worked out for that bit...

06:09.734 --> 06:11.276
No. Please. No.

06:11.939 --> 06:15.604
I just thought you'd like it,
it's a clever pun on Doug,

06:15.724 --> 06:19.023
digging, and I'm awfully nasty
about the Welsh...

06:20.225 --> 06:22.566
- You've got to be joking.
- I'm not gonna help run this place.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.377
I don't get it, why not?

06:24.747 --> 06:27.427
- You really care about this stuff.
- What stuff?

06:27.858 --> 06:30.520
Equality, environmentalism,
feminism,

06:31.177 --> 06:33.630
I don't ever want
to shut my mouth-ism...

06:33.750 --> 06:35.831
Great. You're making me sound great.

06:36.436 --> 06:37.436
Come on.

06:37.945 --> 06:40.360
Come on, you know about politics,
you're always talking about it.

06:42.806 --> 06:45.249
We've had about three conversations
our entire lives.

06:45.441 --> 06:49.369
So the idea that you know I'm always
talking about anything is ridiculous.

06:52.208 --> 06:53.446
Morning ladies.

06:53.566 --> 06:55.194
Love is all around.

06:55.557 --> 06:58.032
- Piss off.
- Naomikins, I've been thinking.

07:00.059 --> 07:01.640
You should see more cock.

07:02.497 --> 07:03.320
Pardon?

07:03.480 --> 07:06.360
Me and you. We should go to it.
Know what I'm saying?

07:06.748 --> 07:07.748
Excuse me?

07:08.122 --> 07:09.122
Go to it?

07:10.177 --> 07:11.160
Definitely.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.227
You've got about as much chance
of fucking me

07:13.347 --> 07:16.119
as becoming the democratic elected
Student President of this dump.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.160
I enjoy a challenge.

07:19.509 --> 07:21.640
Babe... You have got a deal.

07:22.270 --> 07:23.270
What?

07:24.069 --> 07:26.119
I didn't mean it like that.
I'm not going to...

07:26.280 --> 07:28.062
- Guaranteed a shag.
- What?

07:30.558 --> 07:31.950
- Name?
- Crispin.

07:32.747 --> 07:33.783
Second name?

07:34.264 --> 07:35.917
That's it, sir. Just Crispin.

07:36.037 --> 07:39.064
Like Prince, Madonna, Cher,
Lemar... Only Crispin.

07:39.184 --> 07:41.375
And what are your policies, Crispin?

07:41.495 --> 07:43.583
A tightening of college
selection procedure.

07:43.703 --> 07:45.374
They let some awful shit
in this place.

07:47.725 --> 07:49.228
Like him, for instance.

07:49.744 --> 07:52.694
All right, Doug? Is this where
you register to be president, yeah?

07:52.854 --> 07:54.214
You? President?

07:54.496 --> 07:56.032
Yeah, man. Problem?

08:00.473 --> 08:02.374
Fantastic, a two-horse race!

08:03.997 --> 08:05.214
Let the best man win.

08:12.954 --> 08:15.526
So, just fill the form in.

08:34.667 --> 08:36.333
Girls. Stupid.

08:37.054 --> 08:38.605
You're all so stupid.

08:46.680 --> 08:48.380
I can see your knickers.

08:50.419 --> 08:53.267
- You? President?
- Why do people keep saying that?

08:54.127 --> 08:56.311
Me, president. You, my slave.

08:58.554 --> 09:00.279
Why you fighting it, Naomi?

09:01.608 --> 09:05.094
You want it. I want it.
Let's get together and feel all right.

09:05.425 --> 09:08.182
You couldn't make me feel all right
if you stapled your tongue to my clit

09:08.302 --> 09:10.202
and stood on a cement mixer.

09:14.570 --> 09:16.883
Too pussy to take a chance,
little girl.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.653
- See you next time.
- Yeah, you love me.

09:25.850 --> 09:27.807
I was going to ask you
if you wanted a lift.

09:27.927 --> 09:29.838
- What?
- You know, save your legs.

09:29.958 --> 09:31.494
Your wheels. Only if you...

09:34.303 --> 09:36.346
- You can give me a lift.
- Great.

09:39.069 --> 09:40.069
Hang on.

09:54.693 --> 09:56.137
- Mind the spring.
- Where?

10:07.316 --> 10:09.144
This is some automobile
you've got here.

10:10.299 --> 10:12.448
Would you believe
it only cost me Â£2.50?

10:13.954 --> 10:16.115
And three tokens from
the top of Weetabix packets.

10:16.235 --> 10:18.016
Yeah, I really would believe that.

10:18.574 --> 10:19.909
Come on, come on...

10:25.363 --> 10:27.124
Can you give me a lift on your bike?

10:30.085 --> 10:32.666
It's all part
of her grand love note to Ofsted.

10:32.786 --> 10:34.679
It looks good to have
a student president.

10:34.799 --> 10:36.364
Will that person have power?

10:36.484 --> 10:37.916
Will they bollocks.

10:39.183 --> 10:40.774
I ran for office once...

10:41.110 --> 10:43.741
Oh, yes. You're looking
at the Workers Unite candidate,

10:43.861 --> 10:46.534
Bristol City Council,
Redland Ward, 1998.

10:46.993 --> 10:48.397
I bet that went well for you.

10:48.517 --> 10:51.173
I got six votes,
and I knew three of them personally.

10:51.742 --> 10:53.876
But then, buoyed up by my success,

10:53.996 --> 10:57.614
I decided to dedicate my life
to shaping the young minds of tomorrow.

10:58.171 --> 10:59.822
Only to discover
they don't have minds,

10:59.942 --> 11:02.301
only mild jangling things
between their ears.

11:02.425 --> 11:05.846
Mild jangly things that are colour-
co-ordinated to go with their shoes!

11:09.420 --> 11:10.986
I think you should stand.

11:11.106 --> 11:12.535
What? Why?

11:12.838 --> 11:15.113
Come on. You're the best,
we both know it.

11:16.503 --> 11:18.894
Is that a compliment?
Are you complimenting me?

11:19.231 --> 11:21.338
I've got a few compliments in me.

11:23.175 --> 11:26.014
Listen, is it my drug problem,
or is someone waving at that window?

11:28.054 --> 11:29.799
God, it's my mum. Don't look.

11:29.919 --> 11:31.860
Shit. She's so embarrassing!

11:31.980 --> 11:34.191
I want to meet
this mythical creature.

11:38.163 --> 11:39.163
Right.

11:44.774 --> 11:45.774
Thanks.

11:50.707 --> 11:54.296
You wanna do something about this girl.
There is fungal matter in the oven!

11:54.416 --> 11:55.976
You are fungal matter!

11:56.096 --> 11:57.974
It says on the rota
it's your job to clean it.

11:58.291 --> 12:00.673
How many feminists does it take
to change a light bulb?

12:00.793 --> 12:04.236
One. Me. Because I'm oppressed.
You're oppressing me.

12:04.356 --> 12:07.171
The Messiah does not oppress,
OK? He enlightens.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.796
I'll fucking enlighten you,
you patriarchal prick!

12:09.916 --> 12:11.476
Jesus does not do fungus.

12:11.608 --> 12:13.893
Really, does he not do fungus?

12:16.173 --> 12:18.527
I was waving! You were with a man!

12:19.040 --> 12:22.808
- What is this? Surveillance culture?
- I was just saying. He looked nice.

12:23.479 --> 12:25.794
He's my politics teacher, all right?

12:25.914 --> 12:27.559
Okay, just saying.

12:28.142 --> 12:30.620
Nice to see you with a guy.
Makes a change.

12:31.645 --> 12:34.040
Anyway, do you wanna come
and help me feed...?

12:34.604 --> 12:37.920
You don't even know who you're feeding?
This is our house, Mum!

12:38.040 --> 12:39.094
Of course it is.

12:39.790 --> 12:42.370
I think someone stole
the telly from your room.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.120
Who are you? Who is this?

12:46.488 --> 12:48.434
Jesus, is there never any peace?!

12:51.729 --> 12:54.119
- How did you get in here?
- This weird guy let me in.

12:54.799 --> 12:56.449
Looks a bit like Jesus?

12:58.373 --> 13:01.250
It's like a game of Christ-themed
Guess Who in this house.

13:01.943 --> 13:04.350
- What do you want?
- Wanted to give you this.

13:05.321 --> 13:06.800
You're very annoying.

13:07.196 --> 13:08.640
You seem to inspire it in me.

13:10.414 --> 13:11.414
Jinx.

13:11.690 --> 13:13.298
You're gonna run? Great.

13:13.840 --> 13:17.519
- I'll help with the form.
- No, Emily, I don't need any help.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.826
Right. OK. Well, see you.

13:33.643 --> 13:34.812
Just so you know,

13:34.932 --> 13:37.720
my first thought when I see you
is not, "I want to fuck that girl."

13:38.779 --> 13:41.125
We've kissed. Twice. It was nice.

13:41.555 --> 13:43.748
But it's also nice
just being with you,

13:43.868 --> 13:45.990
when you're not being a prick,
that is.

13:47.242 --> 13:48.242
Thanks.

13:48.805 --> 13:51.934
You should run for President
because I think you'd be good at it.

13:52.054 --> 13:53.627
It's that simple, okay?

13:57.465 --> 13:59.050
Then you should... stay.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.774
Thanks. I will.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.680
<i>I can just see it now... in lights.</i>

14:12.367 --> 14:14.326
"Naomi - Get to know me!"

14:15.677 --> 14:17.496
I thought it was quite catchy.

14:17.616 --> 14:19.558
Yeah, well, so's AIDS.

14:24.177 --> 14:27.265
- Do you think I can do it?
- I think you can do anything.

14:27.789 --> 14:28.789
Really?

14:34.739 --> 14:36.289
I've been wondering...

14:43.477 --> 14:45.440
What do lesbians... do?

14:48.759 --> 14:50.242
I mean, in bed.

14:50.766 --> 14:52.258
I know what you mean!

14:52.614 --> 14:54.440
- But why would I know?
- You've never...?

14:54.803 --> 14:56.283
No, I've never!

14:59.014 --> 15:00.014
I mean...

15:00.568 --> 15:03.583
Is it all brogues
and strap-ons, or...?

15:06.047 --> 15:07.859
I don't know. They just...

15:08.804 --> 15:11.080
do what we do to ourselves.
Only to each other.

15:11.643 --> 15:13.463
Probably slightly more aggressively.

15:13.583 --> 15:15.192
And with, you know,

15:16.336 --> 15:17.586
oils and stuff.

15:28.379 --> 15:29.379
Oils?

15:31.127 --> 15:32.127
And stuff.

15:46.171 --> 15:47.320
Oilssss.

15:50.089 --> 15:51.139
Lots of it.

15:51.474 --> 15:52.474
Oils.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.660
Where do you put it? Oils?

15:58.335 --> 15:59.120
On salad.

16:33.553 --> 16:34.586
Fuck's sake.

16:44.646 --> 16:45.973
What are you doing?

17:05.848 --> 17:08.470
<i>I am Cook! Vote for me!</i>

17:08.589 --> 17:10.520
- <i>Vote for non-stop partying!</i>
- Oh, God.

17:15.397 --> 17:17.800
- Who's up there with him?
- JJ.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.440
- Think I lost him.
- What, JJ?

17:28.190 --> 17:29.331
Yeah, him too.

17:33.924 --> 17:35.423
Is this about Effy?

17:36.809 --> 17:38.335
That obvious, is it?

17:39.760 --> 17:41.362
- So tell her.
- I did.

17:44.854 --> 17:47.261
It should make a difference when
someone loves you. Shouldn't it?

17:47.381 --> 17:48.635
<i>We love to party!</i>

17:50.100 --> 17:51.639
<i>We love to party!</i>

18:14.291 --> 18:15.891
You left pretty early.

18:16.125 --> 18:18.200
I had things to do, you know?

18:20.533 --> 18:21.759
I met your mum.

18:21.921 --> 18:22.921
Did you?

18:24.560 --> 18:26.474
- She's nice.
- She's a cliche.

18:26.594 --> 18:28.565
- She's a nice cliche.
- Is she?

18:31.974 --> 18:33.074
Emily, look.

18:33.412 --> 18:36.040
I forgot to tell you.
I made these in anticipation.

18:36.881 --> 18:37.881
Cool, huh?

18:39.664 --> 18:41.200
I got the message, Naomi.

18:41.892 --> 18:42.992
I'll manage.

18:43.868 --> 18:45.849
But there is one thing, though.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.120
You can't let him win, now, can you?

18:54.071 --> 18:55.800
<i>Cook before education!</i>

18:56.549 --> 18:58.040
<i>Sex before exams!</i>

19:02.525 --> 19:05.660
<i>I'm asking for one-to-one tuition
to achieve your goals,</i>

19:05.780 --> 19:07.000
<i>work experience and...</i>

19:11.680 --> 19:13.972
My name is Crispin, that's my name

19:14.092 --> 19:15.879
I don't like chavs, that's my game

19:16.231 --> 19:17.345
If you vote for me

19:17.465 --> 19:20.624
Like a princess and a pea
I'll free you from their menace.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.360
A wigada-wigada-whack
West Morningside!

19:25.840 --> 19:27.400
Next up, Naomi.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.560
What this college needs is
somebody who'll understand...

19:35.258 --> 19:38.280
- Council has to mean something...
- Give a look to the man Cook!

20:11.343 --> 20:13.327
Excuse me. Everyone.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.760
Can I just...?
Can you listen, please?

20:18.628 --> 20:22.319
If you vote for me, I'll make sure each
and every one of your voices is heard.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.551
I'll make it my business to get
to know each...

20:24.671 --> 20:25.671
Apples!

20:27.538 --> 20:30.981
Apples and pears. Get your apples.
Apples and pears.

20:31.101 --> 20:34.277
- Apples and pears. Apples!
- {\See, }This is what you've got to decide.

20:34.973 --> 20:37.760
- Do you want a comedy president...?
- Banana!

20:40.880 --> 20:42.530
You're such a fucking joke!

20:42.650 --> 20:44.707
I'm a joke?
You're fucking hilarious!

20:44.827 --> 20:46.680
At least I care about something.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.200
- There are issues.
- What's{\ so} good about caring? No-one here{\*cares}.

20:49.361 --> 20:50.993
We just wanna party!

20:55.302 --> 20:57.754
Any chance you could be
a cunt over there, d'you think?

21:03.612 --> 21:04.712
That's nice.

21:05.426 --> 21:07.800
Getting your girlfriend
to hold your hand.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.200
Bit of moral support, yeah?
Sweet, innit?

21:12.600 --> 21:13.600
Sweet.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.360
If I'm a joke, at least
people can have a laugh...

21:17.771 --> 21:20.026
Caring's over-rated.
Do you want to know my slogan?

21:20.146 --> 21:21.840
I'm Cook. Vote for me.

21:22.183 --> 21:23.757
I don't give a fuck either.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.800
- Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Just leave me alone!

21:49.419 --> 21:50.720
I hate him!

21:53.720 --> 21:55.370
He's a ball bag, right?

21:56.703 --> 21:58.107
I was such a dick.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.710
- Such a dick.
- What's a bit of public humiliation?

22:01.830 --> 22:03.667
I'm a teacher, I'm used to it.

22:07.020 --> 22:08.461
People fuck you up every day.

22:08.581 --> 22:09.887
Yep. Every day.

22:10.140 --> 22:12.092
After a while
you get to kind of like it.

22:13.269 --> 22:14.569
No, I'm serious.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.320
There.

22:22.331 --> 22:24.753
You look so much prettier
when you smile.

22:27.963 --> 22:29.213
I don't get it.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.937
Why are you so nice
and all other men are such wankers?

22:34.261 --> 22:35.759
Now you've got me.

22:45.825 --> 22:47.082
- What?
- What?

22:47.320 --> 22:48.200
But you're...

22:48.531 --> 22:50.341
You're old enough to be my dad!

22:51.313 --> 22:53.583
Maths was never
my strong suit, but I think,

22:53.703 --> 22:54.981
you know, not quite!

22:57.704 --> 23:00.121
- I thought you liked me!
- I do. And I do.

23:00.392 --> 23:03.054
- What did you just do?
- You wanted me to kiss you.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.174
But I just...

23:05.365 --> 23:06.560
I wanted to trust you.

23:07.202 --> 23:08.689
No, you can...

23:11.077 --> 23:12.077
trust me.

23:40.924 --> 23:41.924
Fuck off!

24:57.971 --> 24:59.358
Can we go somewhere?

25:01.005 --> 25:01.960
Anywhere.

26:00.268 --> 26:01.369
It's lovely.

26:01.863 --> 26:03.196
It's a lovely place.

26:04.067 --> 26:05.724
It's one of my favourites.

26:14.602 --> 26:16.649
I didn't bring a swimming costume.

26:17.581 --> 26:18.781
Neither did I.

26:22.576 --> 26:24.840
- The sun won't shine forever.
- Someone might be looking.

26:26.623 --> 26:28.762
Honey, your body ain't that special.

26:31.231 --> 26:32.482
Don't look, OK?

26:32.662 --> 26:33.462
Fine.

26:54.528 --> 26:55.629
I said don't look!

26:55.754 --> 26:59.156
- I wasn't looking, you just...
- You were looking. You were perving.

27:03.508 --> 27:04.280
Come on.

27:05.123 --> 27:05.960
Get in!

27:10.562 --> 27:12.476
- Oh, Jesus!
- It's freezing!

27:25.139 --> 27:26.458
You all right, Em?

27:31.550 --> 27:32.440
Hello?

27:32.757 --> 27:33.757
Hello?

27:34.248 --> 27:35.519
You deaf or what?

27:36.208 --> 27:38.343
{\You know, }That's the first time
you've asked me something.

27:38.468 --> 27:40.012
- What, today?
- Ever.

27:42.089 --> 27:44.271
Well, answer it then.
You all right?

27:46.376 --> 27:48.326
I'm having
the worst time of my life.

27:48.451 --> 27:50.952
The weather's shit.
The company's even worse.

27:51.077 --> 27:51.877
Amen.

27:59.423 --> 28:00.559
It's peaceful.

28:22.680 --> 28:24.088
Do you wanna do blowbacks?

28:24.817 --> 28:26.315
I never got blowbacks.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.760
Why can't people just smoke
the damn things straight?

28:28.880 --> 28:31.039
It's fun.
Have you even tried it?

28:33.041 --> 28:35.938
But being all seeing,
I already know it's shit.

28:39.157 --> 28:40.876
Come on. Everything once.

28:42.428 --> 28:44.636
Oh, fuck it.
Go ahead and disappoint me.

29:44.614 --> 29:45.750
Say something.

29:47.392 --> 29:49.257
I'm all about experiments, me.

31:11.869 --> 31:12.760
Twice!

31:13.185 --> 31:15.634
You're gonna do this to me, twice!

31:18.805 --> 31:20.956
- You fucking stop right now!
- What?

31:21.399 --> 31:23.850
Don't you dare leave me
in your bed again.

31:24.477 --> 31:25.440
I've got to go.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.876
I know you, Naomi.
I know you're lonely.

31:30.358 --> 31:32.583
I think you need
someone to want you.

31:34.582 --> 31:35.782
I do want you.

31:36.974 --> 31:38.274
So be brave.

31:39.417 --> 31:40.690
And want me back!

32:39.485 --> 32:40.485
Mum.

32:44.804 --> 32:46.393
I know it's early but...

32:51.689 --> 32:53.436
This is my fucking house!

32:55.524 --> 32:57.538
Naomi! For the love of God!

32:57.663 --> 32:58.776
Stop will you!

32:58.901 --> 33:01.301
I came looking for you,
to apologise.

33:02.062 --> 33:04.857
She was here. We got talking.
She's a nice...

33:05.188 --> 33:07.556
Naomi, please.
I'm a fucking disaster, OK?

33:08.287 --> 33:09.200
I just...

33:10.244 --> 33:11.244
I'm lonely.

33:11.821 --> 33:12.821
Fuck off!

33:39.388 --> 33:42.535
Right. Well, these aren't going
to count themselves.

33:44.105 --> 33:46.171
There's one thing
I want to make clear to you.

33:46.296 --> 33:49.197
- That boy will not win.
- Cook? He might win.

33:49.706 --> 33:51.307
He seems very popular.

33:52.487 --> 33:54.051
He will not win.

33:58.232 --> 33:59.232
I mean...

33:59.590 --> 34:00.998
That goes against...

34:01.855 --> 34:03.946
I'm totally against that. Totally...

34:04.251 --> 34:07.524
Don't you have a career review
assessment with me next week?

34:08.232 --> 34:10.876
Totally agree. He will not win.

34:11.043 --> 34:12.043
Right.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.931
This is how it will work.
Vote for Naomi, this pile.

34:16.382 --> 34:18.985
Vote for Crispin, this pile.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.835
Someone voted for Crispin?

34:21.159 --> 34:23.447
Vote for Cook, this pile.

34:25.123 --> 34:26.123
Right.

34:27.324 --> 34:28.324
Right.

34:30.811 --> 34:33.944
- I think we're gonna need a bigger bra.
- Shut up and get on with it.

34:34.069 --> 34:35.467
Drum roll, please.

34:49.777 --> 34:50.777
Thank you.

34:51.362 --> 34:52.163
And...

34:52.685 --> 34:53.775
the winner...

34:53.976 --> 34:54.976
is...

35:01.334 --> 35:04.045
Naomi, do you have a few words?

35:16.304 --> 35:18.716
- You should have more confidence.
- What?

35:19.097 --> 35:21.036
I mean, your tits are fine.

35:21.455 --> 35:22.455
What?

35:31.244 --> 35:33.975
Now, I'm not sure,
but were these votes counted?

35:36.927 --> 35:39.581
Stop the silliness.
Celebrate. You've won.

35:40.527 --> 35:41.618
Cook won.

35:42.478 --> 35:43.876
He's our President.

35:56.562 --> 35:59.932
And my first act
as President of this school,

36:00.843 --> 36:03.573
is to declare this riot open!

36:49.020 --> 36:49.820
So...

36:52.475 --> 36:53.865
Where does this go next?

36:53.990 --> 36:57.641
Burning all the gym equipment or
shitting in the College Director's desk?

36:57.766 --> 36:59.320
I tell you, I'd be up for either.

37:03.536 --> 37:04.440
I'm sorry.

37:07.329 --> 37:10.058
You're supposed
to be flattered by my intention.

37:10.183 --> 37:12.396
But ultimately,
honourably, unobtainable.

37:14.677 --> 37:16.361
A bit too flattered maybe.

37:17.280 --> 37:18.280
A bit too

37:18.801 --> 37:19.640
obtainable.

37:20.264 --> 37:22.312
- A bit of a twat.
- Yeah, maybe.

37:24.964 --> 37:25.960
Do you like her?

37:27.755 --> 37:28.755
She's...

37:30.030 --> 37:30.880
She's right.

37:34.396 --> 37:36.316
So go tell her, will you?

37:38.659 --> 37:39.459
Sure.

37:42.034 --> 37:43.034
Thanks!

38:00.398 --> 38:02.224
I'm looking for three pornos,

38:02.720 --> 38:05.694
two ninja stars and a butt plug
that Kieran fucker confiscated.

38:06.408 --> 38:08.040
Think you'll be expelled for this?

38:08.733 --> 38:11.231
They'll have to explain why,
wouldn't they?

38:11.356 --> 38:13.131
I reckon, when this is over,

38:13.672 --> 38:15.733
they'll try and pretend
it never happened.

38:15.858 --> 38:19.009
- You're probably right.
- I entered to piss you off, obviously.

38:19.134 --> 38:20.134
Obviously.

38:24.744 --> 38:27.020
You ever wish
things were just simple?

38:27.644 --> 38:29.393
Things are simple. I won.

38:30.451 --> 38:32.448
Now we get to willy waggle, yeah?

38:33.345 --> 38:35.263
- I never said...
- Are you sure?

38:35.388 --> 38:38.065
- Are you sure you never said cos...
- Hang on.

38:38.770 --> 38:40.598
I think we should willy waggle.

38:50.082 --> 38:52.160
They all come to the
Cookie Monster in the end.

39:15.513 --> 39:16.784
This isn't right.

39:17.186 --> 39:17.986
What?

39:20.384 --> 39:22.386
Sorry. It's just isn't a goer.

39:23.801 --> 39:24.847
Fair enough.

39:25.335 --> 39:27.480
Is that's it? You're not even
gonna try and convince me?

39:28.107 --> 39:30.246
- Most guys would.
- Most guys aren't me, babe.

39:30.371 --> 39:32.420
You fancy me, I'm cool with it.

39:33.310 --> 39:37.116
So there's another reason why you won't
fuck me. It's probably a good one cos

39:37.284 --> 39:38.084
you're,

39:38.478 --> 39:39.478
you know,

39:40.341 --> 39:41.141
clever.

39:46.705 --> 39:49.076
You're a lot nicer
than most people think.

39:49.374 --> 39:50.374
Fuck you.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.359
Fuck you right back.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.973
You noticed how quiet it is?

41:10.061 --> 41:11.320
You kicked them out?

41:11.445 --> 41:13.596
Probably take a few days
to clean the place, right?

41:16.336 --> 41:19.200
What did you want to talk
to me about this morning?

41:20.761 --> 41:21.716
Is anyone here?

41:22.150 --> 41:25.483
Just some man who seemed to think
you wanted him back in my bed.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.930
He's very entertaining
for an Irishman.

41:32.355 --> 41:33.537
It is peaceful.

41:37.386 --> 41:40.556
Did I ever tell you how angry I was when
I found out I was pregnant with you?

41:41.397 --> 41:43.120
Is this going to cheer me up?

41:43.374 --> 41:46.455
- Because I need cheering up. OK?
- I'm getting there.

41:47.959 --> 41:49.775
I'd met the man of my dreams.

41:50.084 --> 41:53.312
I wanted to travel the world,
fuck on every beach in India,

41:53.517 --> 41:56.245
be in love, and then
I found out I was pregnant.

41:57.707 --> 41:59.161
I can only apologise.

42:01.772 --> 42:05.040
And, you know, your dad turned out
to be a shitty little prick,

42:05.165 --> 42:07.232
and it was all a little bit rubbish.

42:08.030 --> 42:10.652
Until you made my life complete.

42:13.084 --> 42:15.400
And actually,
rather fucking wonderful.

42:18.722 --> 42:19.722
I did that?

42:21.147 --> 42:22.649
I wasn't expecting it.

42:23.507 --> 42:26.642
People who make us happy are
never the people you expect.

42:30.470 --> 42:32.151
So, when you find someone.

42:33.356 --> 42:34.992
You've got to cherish it.

42:49.520 --> 42:50.520
Right then.

42:50.948 --> 42:53.838
I've got an Irishman waiting for me,
who says all he needs for happiness

42:53.963 --> 42:56.209
is regular sex and potatoes.

43:37.037 --> 43:38.809
I'm not gonna open the door.

43:39.349 --> 43:40.900
My face is all puffy.

43:41.926 --> 43:43.027
I've been...

43:43.650 --> 43:45.752
- crying a bit.
- I don't care.

44:07.357 --> 44:08.756
I do want someone.

44:09.852 --> 44:12.312
Need someone. You're right.

44:15.559 --> 44:16.359
And?

44:17.356 --> 44:18.156
And...

44:19.665 --> 44:23.050
when I'm with you,
I feel like I'm a better person.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.699
I feel happier. Less...

44:28.319 --> 44:29.319
alone.

44:29.953 --> 44:31.053
Less lonely.

44:44.010 --> 44:45.965
But it's not
as simple as that, is it?

44:46.412 --> 44:47.763
Being with someone.

44:49.280 --> 44:50.280
Isn't it?

44:54.281 --> 44:55.281
I mean,

44:56.320 --> 44:57.469
I don't know.

44:58.722 --> 44:59.996
I mean, I don't think so.

45:03.844 --> 45:04.844
I mean...

45:14.266 --> 45:16.130
Can't we just sit like this...

45:16.951 --> 45:17.951
for a bit?

45:35.362 --> 45:36.362
We can.

45:38.703 --> 45:39.703
For a bit.

45:56.119 --> 45:57.552
I've been getting locked on.

45:58.561 --> 45:59.516
Breaking stuff.

46:01.240 --> 46:02.512
Getting into rages.

46:04.784 --> 46:06.151
- Don't do that.
- Right.

46:06.276 --> 46:08.752
You gotta choose, mate.
Either me or Cook.

46:08.920 --> 46:11.605
- Please make up with Freddie, Cook.
- He can fuck himself.

46:11.730 --> 46:13.700
- All those things you want.
- I love you.

46:13.825 --> 46:16.392
You don't ask for them.
Why don't you just ask?

46:17.305 --> 46:23.167
