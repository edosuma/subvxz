WEBVTT

02:51.045 --> 02:52.171
Um...

03:10.648 --> 03:13.275
Whoa!

03:23.286 --> 03:24.661
Whoa, whoa.

03:32.754 --> 03:33.837
Hmm.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.268
Heads.

03:51.731 --> 03:52.773
Heads.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.152
Heads.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.615
Heads.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.036
Heads.

04:08.957 --> 04:09.998
Heads.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.502
Heads.

04:16.880 --> 04:17.964
Heads.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.385
Heads.

04:23.888 --> 04:24.888
Heads.

04:29.686 --> 04:30.686
Heads.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.524
Heads.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.361
Heads.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.030
Heads.

04:44.993 --> 04:45.993
Heads.

04:50.581 --> 04:51.623
Heads.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.128
Heads.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.048
Heads.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.642
Heads.

05:19.902 --> 05:20.944
Bet.

05:21.612 --> 05:22.904
Heads I win.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.996
Again...

05:33.541 --> 05:34.624
Heads.

05:44.927 --> 05:45.927
Heads.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.014
Heads.

05:50.558 --> 05:51.600
Heads.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.269
Heads.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.480
Whoops!

06:09.243 --> 06:10.660
It must be
indicative of something

06:10.787 --> 06:12.329
besides the
redistribution of wealth.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.546
Heads.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.299
A weaker man might be moved
to re-examine his faith,

06:25.134 --> 06:27.344
for nothing else at least
in the law of probability.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.262
Heads.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.518
Consider.

06:35.561 --> 06:36.603
One,

06:37.146 --> 06:40.357
probability is a factor which
operates within natural forces.

06:41.192 --> 06:45.070
Two, probability is not
operating as a factor.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.949
Three, we are now held within

06:49.784 --> 06:53.495
un-, sub-,
or supernatural forces.

06:55.623 --> 06:56.665
Discuss.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.333
What?

06:58.918 --> 07:00.043
Look at it this way.

07:00.336 --> 07:01.503
If six monkeys...

07:04.507 --> 07:06.007
If six monkeys...

07:07.301 --> 07:09.094
The law of averages, if I
have got this right, means

07:09.262 --> 07:11.513
that if six monkeys were thrown
up in the air long enough

07:11.848 --> 07:13.807
they would land on their
tails about as often

07:13.933 --> 07:14.975
as they would land on their--

07:15.101 --> 07:16.101
Heads.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.854
Getting a
bit of a bore, isn't it?

07:19.105 --> 07:20.272
A bore?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.523
Well...

07:21.816 --> 07:23.233
What about the suspense?

07:24.735 --> 07:25.902
What suspense?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.905
It must be the law
of diminishing returns.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.741
I feel the spell
about to be broken.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.546
Well, it was an even chance.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.842
Seventy eight in a row.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.428
A new record, I imagine.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.890
Is that what you imagine?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.516
A new record?

07:57.435 --> 07:58.518
Well...

07:58.644 --> 08:00.896
No questions,
not a flicker of doubt?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.273
I could be wrong.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.233
No fear?

08:05.401 --> 08:06.401
Fear?

08:08.070 --> 08:09.154
Fear.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.034
Seventy nine.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.554
I think I have it.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.933
Time has stopped dead.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.268
The single experience of
one coin being spun once

08:40.520 --> 08:44.314
has been repeated...
156 times.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.816
On the whole, doubtful.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.239
Or, a spectacular
vindication of the principle

08:52.406 --> 08:54.449
that each individual
coin spun individually is

08:54.575 --> 08:55.784
as likely to come
down heads as tails

08:55.910 --> 08:57.786
and therefore should
cause no surprise

08:57.954 --> 08:58.995
each individual time it does.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.288
Heads.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.751
I've never known
anything like it.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.628
He's never known
anything like it.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.548
But he has never known
anything to write home about

09:09.715 --> 09:12.467
and therefore it is
nothing to write home about.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.568
What's the first
thing you remember?

09:30.987 --> 09:32.988
Oh, let's see, hm...

09:33.990 --> 09:36.074
The first thing that comes
into my head, you mean?

09:37.493 --> 09:40.537
No, the first
thing you remember.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.038
Ah.

09:45.167 --> 09:48.211
No, it's no good.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.505
It's gone.
It was a long time ago.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.382
You don't get my meaning.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.343
What's the first thing after

09:55.720 --> 09:57.137
all the things you've forgotten?

09:57.680 --> 09:58.972
Oh, I see.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.442
I've forgotten the question.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.112
Are you happy?

10:14.739 --> 10:15.780
What?

10:15.906 --> 10:17.657
Content? At ease?

10:17.825 --> 10:18.867
Well, I suppose so.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.243
What are you going to do now?

10:20.911 --> 10:23.955
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

10:26.125 --> 10:27.208
Look.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.213
What about it?

10:32.923 --> 10:33.965
Well.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.722
We have been spinning
coins together since...

10:42.058 --> 10:43.141
I don't know when,

10:43.559 --> 10:44.976
and in all that time,
if it is all that time,

10:45.144 --> 10:48.396
157 coins spun consecutively
have come down heads,

10:48.648 --> 10:50.065
157 consecutive times,

10:50.232 --> 10:51.941
and all you can do is
play with your food.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.234
Wait a minute.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.198
There was a messenger.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.662
Rosencrantz!
Guildenstern!

11:03.996 --> 11:05.372
We were sent for.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.821
Another
curious scientific phenomenon

11:38.030 --> 11:40.657
is the fact that the
fingernails grow after death

11:41.200 --> 11:42.492
as does the beard.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.078
What?

11:45.955 --> 11:46.996
Beard.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.498
But you're not dead!

11:48.833 --> 11:50.166
I didn't say
they only started

11:50.334 --> 11:51.584
to grow after death.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.963
The fingernails also
grow before birth.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.257
Though not the beard.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.592
What?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.845
Beard!
What's the matter with you?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.472
The toenails on the other
hand never grow at all.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.393
The toenails on the other
foot never grow at all.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.019
No.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.647
Do you remember the first
thing that happened today?

12:13.441 --> 12:15.108
Oh, I woke up, I suppose.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.074
I've got it now...

12:25.161 --> 12:28.121
That man, he woke us up.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.372
A messenger.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.665
That's it.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.542
Pale sky before dawn,

12:33.085 --> 12:35.837
a man standing on his saddle
to bang on the shutters.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.174
But then he called our names.

12:40.968 --> 12:44.387
You remember,
that man woke us up.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.514
We were sent for.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.308
That's why we're here.

12:50.561 --> 12:54.147
Traveling, a matter
of extreme urgency.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.816
"A royal summons"
was his very words.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.818
Official business
no questions asked.

12:58.986 --> 12:59.986
Up, we get and off at the gallop

13:00.154 --> 13:01.654
fearful lest we come too late!

13:01.781 --> 13:02.947
Too late for what?

13:03.574 --> 13:04.908
How would I know?

13:05.409 --> 13:06.701
We haven't got there yet.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.416
What's that?

13:46.742 --> 13:47.826
Halt!

13:51.038 --> 13:52.664
An audience!

13:58.921 --> 14:00.463
Don't move!

14:40.254 --> 14:44.299
Perfect. Well met, in
fact, and just in time.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.425
Why's that?

14:45.551 --> 14:47.218
Why, we grow rusty.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.888
And you catch us at the
very point of decadence.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.347
This time tomorrow we
might have forgotten

14:51.473 --> 14:52.640
everything we ever knew.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.893
We'd be back where we
started, improvising.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.352
Tumblers, are you?

14:56.562 --> 14:58.688
We can give you a tumble,
if that's your taste,

14:58.814 --> 15:00.815
and times being what they are.

15:01.066 --> 15:04.068
Otherwise, for a jingle of
coin we can do you a selection

15:04.236 --> 15:07.155
of gory romances pirated
from the Italian.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.990
And it doesn't take
much to make a jingle.

15:09.116 --> 15:12.911
Even a single coin has music
in it, should it be gold.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.370
Tragedians!

15:21.921 --> 15:23.922
At your command.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.635
My name is Guildenstern,
and this is Rosencrantz.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.180
I'm sorry, his name's
Guildenstern,

15:32.306 --> 15:33.598
and I'm Rosencrantz.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.769
We've played to bigger, but
quality counts for something.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.690
Tragedians.
What exactly do you do?

15:42.816 --> 15:44.192
Tragedy, sir.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.866
Deaths and disclosures,
universal and particular.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.242
Denouements.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.163
Transvestite melodrama.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.833
We transport you back into a
world of intrigue and illusion.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.585
Clowns if you like.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.301
Murders.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.185
We can do you ghosts.

16:21.939 --> 16:22.981
And battles.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.114
On the skirmish level.

16:31.573 --> 16:34.200
Heroes, villains,

16:34.868 --> 16:36.536
tormented lovers.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.457
Set pieces in the poetic vein.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.918
We can do you rapiers,

16:44.586 --> 16:45.962
or rape,

16:46.839 --> 16:48.256
or both.

16:50.759 --> 16:54.053
By all means, faithless
wives and ravished virgins,

16:54.847 --> 16:57.932
flagrant delicto at a price

16:58.058 --> 16:59.934
for which there
are special terms.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.061
It costs little to watch,

17:02.354 --> 17:05.397
and a little more to get
caught up in the action.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.026
If that's your taste, and
times being what they are.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.444
What are they?

17:09.987 --> 17:11.237
Indifferent.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.405
Bad?

17:12.614 --> 17:13.948
Wicked.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.286
See anything you like?

17:18.619 --> 17:20.496
Lucky thing we came along.

17:20.622 --> 17:21.622
For us?

17:22.124 --> 17:23.875
Also for you.

17:24.334 --> 17:28.337
For some it is performance,
for others patronage.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.757
They are two sides
of the same coin.

17:30.924 --> 17:33.009
Or being as there
are so many of us,

17:34.261 --> 17:36.471
the same side of two coins.

17:36.764 --> 17:37.805
It was luck, then?

17:37.931 --> 17:38.931
Or fate.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.224
Yours or ours?

17:40.350 --> 17:42.310
It could hardly be
one without the other.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.438
Fate then.

17:47.649 --> 17:48.900
You said,

17:50.235 --> 17:51.861
caught up in the action?

17:53.697 --> 17:56.741
I did. I did.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.619
You're quicker than your friend.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.622
For a handful of
coin, I happen to have

18:02.831 --> 18:04.707
a private and uncut performance

18:05.000 --> 18:07.502
of The Rape of the Sabine Women.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.671
Or rather woman.
Or rather Alfred.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.548
And for eight you
can participate.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.814
It could have been...

18:30.150 --> 18:32.610
It didn't have to be obscene.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.363
I was prepared.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.949
But it's this, is it?

18:39.409 --> 18:42.703
No enigma, no dignity,
nothing classical or poetic.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.331
Only this.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.919
A comic pornographer and
a rabble of prostitutes.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.048
You should have
caught us in better times.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.926
We were purists then.

18:58.554 --> 18:59.679
Excuse me.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.098
Alfred.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.519
You're not,
exclusively players, then?

19:06.687 --> 19:08.729
We're inclusively
players, sir.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.732
- I had no idea.
- No.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.443
I mean, I've heard, but
I've never actually seen.

19:14.570 --> 19:15.570
No.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.114
I mean, what
exactly do you do?

19:18.365 --> 19:19.615
We keep to our usual stuff,

19:19.825 --> 19:22.702
more or less, only inside out.

19:22.911 --> 19:26.497
We do on stage the things that
are supposed to happen off.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.040
Which is a kind of integrity,

19:28.208 --> 19:31.794
if you look on every exit as
an entrance somewhere else.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.172
Wait a minute.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.221
What will you do for that?

19:49.855 --> 19:51.314
Do you know any good plays?

19:52.232 --> 19:54.609
Plays? Oh, yes.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.902
One of the Greeks, perhaps?

19:56.028 --> 19:58.070
You're familiar with the
tragedies of antiquity, are you?

19:58.238 --> 19:59.322
The great homicidal classics?

19:59.489 --> 20:02.450
Maidens aspiring to
godheads, or vice versa?

20:02.618 --> 20:04.827
That's your kind
of thing, is it?

20:05.245 --> 20:06.579
I can't say it is, really.

20:06.747 --> 20:10.249
We're more of the love,
blood and rhetoric school.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.127
Well, we can do you blood
and love without the rhetoric

20:13.295 --> 20:14.962
and we can do you blood and
rhetoric without the love

20:15.088 --> 20:18.341
and we can do you all three
concurrent or consecutive.

20:18.467 --> 20:22.053
But we can't give you love and
rhetoric without the blood.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.721
Blood is compulsory.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.932
They're all blood, you see.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.142
Is that what people want?

20:28.268 --> 20:29.602
It's what we do.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.480
Would you like a bet?

20:35.901 --> 20:36.901
Double or nothing.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.110
Heads.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.453
Heads.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.002
Double or nothing.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.509
Come on.

21:01.677 --> 21:05.554
I say that was
lucky. It was tails.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.791
Ah!

22:29.264 --> 22:32.933
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.605
Moreover that we much
did long to see you.

22:37.731 --> 22:41.525
The need we have to use you
did provoke our hasty sending.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.612
Something have you heard
of Hamlet's transformation.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.614
So call it.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.783
Sith nor the exterior
nor the inward men

22:48.909 --> 22:50.534
resembles that it was.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.246
What it should be,

22:54.664 --> 22:57.124
more than his father's
death, that thus hath put him

22:57.250 --> 22:59.418
so far from the
understanding of himself.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.962
I cannot dream of.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.758
I entreat you both,

23:07.052 --> 23:09.345
that being of so young
days brought up with him,

23:09.471 --> 23:12.431
and sith so neighbored
to his youth and haviour,

23:12.974 --> 23:14.475
that you vouchsafe your rest

23:14.601 --> 23:16.769
here in our court
some little time.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.814
So by your companies to
draw him on to pleasures

23:20.816 --> 23:23.734
and to gather so much as
from occasion you may glean

23:24.736 --> 23:27.571
whether aught to us
unknown afflicts him thus

23:29.324 --> 23:32.410
that opened lies
within our remedy.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.620
Good.

23:37.249 --> 23:41.043
Gentleman, he hath
much talked of you.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.462
And sure I am, two men
there are not living

23:43.588 --> 23:45.464
to whom he more adheres.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.050
If it will please you to
show us so much gentry

23:48.176 --> 23:51.345
and good will as to extend
your time with us awhile

23:51.680 --> 23:54.140
for the supply and
profit of our hope,

23:54.516 --> 23:56.642
your visitation shall
receive such thanks

23:56.768 --> 23:59.395
as fits a king's remembrance.

23:59.688 --> 24:00.855
Both your majesties might

24:01.022 --> 24:02.690
by the sovereign
power you have of us,

24:02.858 --> 24:06.527
put your dread pleasures more
into command than to entreaty.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.904
But we both obey, and
here give up ourselves

24:09.030 --> 24:11.615
in the full bent to lay our
service freely at your feet,

24:11.741 --> 24:12.783
to be commanded.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.702
Thanks, Rosencrantz.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.996
And gentle Guildenstern.

24:17.372 --> 24:21.417
Thanks Guildenstern
and gentle Rosencrantz.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.420
And I beseech you
instantly to visit

24:24.546 --> 24:26.672
my too much changed son.

24:26.798 --> 24:28.549
Heaven make our
presence and our practices

24:28.675 --> 24:30.134
pleasant and helpful to him!

24:30.343 --> 24:31.969
Aye, amen.

24:35.765 --> 24:36.974
I want to go home.

24:37.392 --> 24:38.642
Don't let them confuse you.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.948
We're in over our steps,

24:54.159 --> 24:55.534
heading out of depth.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.412
Stepping out of our heads,

24:59.414 --> 25:00.998
so heading to a dead stop!

25:01.166 --> 25:05.461
There!

25:05.754 --> 25:07.505
Hasn't it ever happened to
you that all of a sudden

25:07.631 --> 25:09.965
and for no reason at all you
haven't the faintest idea

25:10.091 --> 25:12.927
how to spell the word "which"

25:13.803 --> 25:15.221
or "house"

25:15.931 --> 25:17.598
because when you write it down

25:17.766 --> 25:19.308
you just can't remember
ever having seen

25:19.476 --> 25:21.143
those letters in
that order before?

25:21.269 --> 25:22.937
- I remember.
- What?

25:23.063 --> 25:24.230
I remember when there
were no questions.

25:24.397 --> 25:25.689
There were always questions.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.150
Answers, yes. There were
answers to everything.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.528
- You've forgotten.
- I haven't forgotten!

25:30.779 --> 25:33.739
How I used to remember my
own name! And yours. Oh, yes!

25:34.282 --> 25:35.991
There were answers
everywhere you looked.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.576
There was no question about it.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.829
People knew who we were and
if they didn't they asked,

25:40.956 --> 25:42.081
we told them out names.

25:42.249 --> 25:45.125
We did. The trouble is,
each of them is plausible,

25:45.293 --> 25:46.585
without being instinctive.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.259
Instinctive?

25:54.135 --> 25:55.886
All your life you
live so close to truth,

25:56.012 --> 25:58.514
it becomes a permanent blur
in the corner of your eye,

25:58.932 --> 26:00.849
and when something
nudges it into outline,

26:00.976 --> 26:03.060
it's like being
ambushed by a grotesque.

26:03.728 --> 26:06.397
A man standing in his saddle in
the half-lit, half-alive dawn

26:06.523 --> 26:08.566
banged in the shutters
and called two names.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.777
And when he called we came.
That much is certain, we came.

26:12.696 --> 26:13.737
Well, I can tell you

26:13.863 --> 26:14.947
I'm sick to death of it.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.115
I don't care which one I am.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.616
So why don't you
make up your mind?

26:17.784 --> 26:18.867
We didn't come all this way

26:18.994 --> 26:20.077
for a christening.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.746
But we have been
comparatively fortunate.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.164
We might have been left to sift

26:24.291 --> 26:25.666
the whole field of
human nomenclature

26:25.792 --> 26:28.669
like two blind men looting a
bazaar for their own portraits.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.713
At least we are presented
with alternatives.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.131
Well, as from
now my name is--

26:32.257 --> 26:34.133
But not choice.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.218
Your smallest action sets
off another somewhere else,

26:36.344 --> 26:37.678
and is set off by it.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.472
And I do think
or else this brain of mine...

26:40.890 --> 26:42.433
We're
going round in circles.

26:42.601 --> 26:46.228
...so sure as it
hath use to do that I have found

26:46.354 --> 26:49.315
the very cause of
Hamlet's lunacy.

26:51.359 --> 26:52.568
Oh, speak of that!

26:52.861 --> 26:54.945
That do I long to hear.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.865
Give first admittance
to the ambassadors.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.426
He tells me, my dear Gertrude,
he hath found the head

27:17.552 --> 27:19.720
and source of all your
son's distemper.

27:19.846 --> 27:22.389
I doubt it is no
other but the main.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.352
His father's death

27:26.895 --> 27:29.438
and our o'er hasty marriage.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.316
Well.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.362
We shall sift him.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.294
It's all right.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.755
There's a logic at work.

27:54.881 --> 27:57.007
It's all done for
you, don't worry.

27:57.467 --> 27:59.426
Enjoy it. Relax.

28:08.436 --> 28:09.520
Relax.

28:12.482 --> 28:13.732
We have been briefed.

28:13.858 --> 28:14.900
Have we?

28:15.151 --> 28:17.444
Hamlet's transformation,
what do you recollect?

28:18.613 --> 28:20.280
Well, he's changed, hasn't he?

28:20.573 --> 28:23.200
The exterior and inward
man falls to resemble.

28:23.326 --> 28:25.661
Draw him onto pleasures,
glean what afflicts him.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.329
Something more than
his father's death.

28:27.455 --> 28:28.455
He's always talking about us.

28:28.581 --> 28:30.541
There aren't two people living
whom he dotes on more than us.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.793
We cheer him up,
find out what's the matter.

28:33.128 --> 28:34.169
Exactly.

28:34.295 --> 28:36.755
It's just a matter of
asking the right questions

28:37.132 --> 28:38.841
and giving away as
little as we can.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.008
And then we can go?

28:40.135 --> 28:42.094
And receive such thanks as
fits as king's remembrance.

28:42.804 --> 28:45.389
Oh, I like the
sound of that...

28:46.349 --> 28:48.809
What do you think she
meant by remembrance?

28:49.144 --> 28:50.686
He doesn't forget his friends.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.354
Would you care to estimate?

28:52.480 --> 28:54.106
Some kings tend
to be amnesiac,

28:54.232 --> 28:57.526
others the opposite, I
suppose, whatever that is.

28:57.652 --> 28:58.777
How much?

28:58.903 --> 29:00.779
- Elephantine.
- How much?

29:01.906 --> 29:05.033
Retentive. He's a
very retentive king.

29:05.326 --> 29:06.910
A royal retainer.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.079
- What are you playing at?
- Words.

29:09.330 --> 29:11.290
Words. They're all
we have to go on.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.148
Look at this.

30:24.697 --> 30:25.864
Leave things alone.

30:27.033 --> 30:28.116
Sorry.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.477
This is interesting.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.566
You would think

31:01.693 --> 31:06.405
this would fall faster
than this, wouldn't you?

31:25.133 --> 31:26.925
And you'd be absolutely right.

31:44.777 --> 31:45.861
Fancy a game?

31:47.989 --> 31:49.281
We're spectators.

31:49.824 --> 31:51.158
Do you want to play questions?

31:54.954 --> 31:57.331
- How do you play that?
- You have to ask questions.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.540
Statement, one love.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.584
- Cheating!
- How?

32:00.710 --> 32:02.878
- I hadn't started yet.
- Statement, two love.

32:03.004 --> 32:04.129
- Are you counting that?
- What?

32:04.255 --> 32:05.380
Are you counting that?

32:05.548 --> 32:06.840
Foul! No repetition.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.133
Three love and game.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.430
I'm not going to play if
you're going to be like that.

32:27.445 --> 32:28.487
Whose serve?

32:29.155 --> 32:30.822
- Uh...
- Hesitation! Love one.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.369
- Whose go?
- Why?

32:35.495 --> 32:36.662
- Why not?
- What for?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.747
Foul! No synonyms! One all.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.169
What in God's
name is going on?

32:44.379 --> 32:46.505
Foul! No rhetoric! Two - one.

32:46.756 --> 32:48.340
What does it all add up to?

32:48.508 --> 32:50.384
- Can't you guess?
- Were you addressing me?

32:50.677 --> 32:51.927
Is there anyone else?

32:52.929 --> 32:54.137
- Who?
- How would I know?

32:54.263 --> 32:55.555
- Why do you ask?
- Are you serious?

32:55.765 --> 32:57.599
- Was that rhetoric?
- No.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.685
Statement!
Two all. Game point.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.648
What's the matter
with you today?

33:05.024 --> 33:06.024
- When?
- What?

33:06.150 --> 33:07.484
- Are you deaf?
- Am I dead?

33:07.610 --> 33:08.735
Yes or no?

33:08.903 --> 33:10.529
- Is there a choice?
- Is there a God?

33:10.655 --> 33:13.532
Foul! No non-sequiturs!
Three - two, one game all.

33:18.579 --> 33:20.038
- What's your name?
- What's yours?

33:20.373 --> 33:22.374
- You first.
- Statement! One love.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.335
What's your name
when you're at home?

33:25.461 --> 33:27.045
- What's yours?
- When I'm at home?

33:27.171 --> 33:28.213
Is it different at home?

33:28.339 --> 33:29.464
- What home?
- Haven't you got one?

33:29.590 --> 33:31.758
- Why do you ask?
- What are you driving at?

33:31.884 --> 33:32.926
What's your name?

33:33.052 --> 33:35.053
Repetition! Two love.
Match point.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.222
Who do you think you are?

33:37.348 --> 33:39.725
Rhetoric! Game and match!

34:02.123 --> 34:03.540
- Rosencrantz!
- What?

34:09.464 --> 34:10.505
There.

34:13.842 --> 34:14.885
How was that?

34:15.344 --> 34:17.054
- Clever.
- Natural?

34:17.346 --> 34:18.429
Instinctive!

34:20.308 --> 34:22.016
Now I'll try you. Guil--

34:22.143 --> 34:23.726
Not yet!
Catch me unawares.

34:24.562 --> 34:27.647
Right... Guil--

34:27.815 --> 34:30.233
No, me, unawares.

34:53.466 --> 34:54.507
Ready?

34:57.470 --> 34:58.595
Never mind.

35:09.398 --> 35:11.149
...for I will use no art,

35:11.609 --> 35:14.903
mad let us grant him
then and now remains

35:15.029 --> 35:17.197
that we find out the
cause of this effect,

35:17.323 --> 35:19.324
or rather say, the
cause of this defect.

35:19.450 --> 35:22.202
For this effect
defective, comes by cause.

35:22.370 --> 35:25.247
Thus it remains, and
the remainder thus.

35:25.456 --> 35:28.583
Perpend.
I have a daughter.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.335
Have, while she is mine.

35:30.503 --> 35:33.839
Who in her duty and
obedience, mark,

35:34.340 --> 35:36.049
hath given me this.

35:36.425 --> 35:40.095
Now gather, and surmise.

35:40.471 --> 35:44.141
"To the celestial,
and my soul's idol,

35:44.600 --> 35:47.477
the most beautified Ophelia."

35:47.645 --> 35:49.771
That's an ill phrase,
a vile phrase.

35:49.897 --> 35:52.274
Beautified is a vile phrase.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.609
But that you shall hear, thus,

35:54.735 --> 35:57.988
"In her excellent
white bosom..."

35:58.114 --> 36:00.031
Came this
from Hamlet to her?

36:00.741 --> 36:03.243
Good Madam,
stay awhile, I will be faithful.

36:04.787 --> 36:07.414
"Doubt thou,
the stars are fire.

36:07.915 --> 36:09.958
Doubt that the sun doth move,

36:10.668 --> 36:12.836
doubt truths to be a lie,

36:13.296 --> 36:15.255
but never doubt I love."

37:04.013 --> 37:07.224
...his hot love on
the wing, as I perceived it,

37:07.433 --> 37:10.310
I must tell you that
before my daughter told me,

37:10.436 --> 37:13.939
what might you, or my dear
Majesty, your queen here, think,

37:14.065 --> 37:16.733
if I had played the
desk or table-book.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.277
Or given my heart...

37:20.154 --> 37:23.365
...dumb, or looked upon
this love, with idle sight,

37:23.491 --> 37:25.367
what might you think?

37:25.576 --> 37:28.662
No, I went round to work,

37:28.913 --> 37:31.498
and my young mistress
thus I did bespeak,

37:31.707 --> 37:35.752
Lord Hamlet is a
Prince out of thy star.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.421
This must not be.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.864
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

38:05.324 --> 38:06.992
Well, God have mercy.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.953
Do you know me, my lord?

38:10.371 --> 38:11.621
Excellent.

38:12.707 --> 38:13.999
Excellent well.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.835
- You are a fishmonger.
- Not I, my lord.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.878
Then I would
you were so honest a man.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.380
Honest, my lord?

38:26.721 --> 38:28.346
What do you read, my lord?

38:28.639 --> 38:30.932
Words, words, words.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.934
What is
the matter, my lord?

38:33.060 --> 38:34.144
Between who?

38:34.270 --> 38:36.521
I mean the
matter that you read, my lord.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.148
Statement.

38:38.274 --> 38:39.607
Slander, sir.

38:40.109 --> 38:42.110
For the satirical
rogue says here

38:42.236 --> 38:45.238
that old man have Grey beards...

38:52.163 --> 38:53.246
Who was that?

38:53.372 --> 38:54.414
Didn't you know him?

38:54.540 --> 38:55.498
He didn't know me.

38:55.624 --> 38:56.624
He didn't see you.

38:56.751 --> 38:57.917
I didn't see him.

38:58.044 --> 38:59.127
We shall see.

38:59.712 --> 39:01.504
I hardly knew him, he's changed.

39:01.630 --> 39:03.048
- You could see that?
- Transformed.

39:03.215 --> 39:04.632
- How do you know?
- Inside and out.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.092
- I see.
- He's not himself, you know.

39:06.385 --> 39:07.886
- He's changed.
- I could see that.

39:10.097 --> 39:11.806
Glean what afflicts him!

39:11.974 --> 39:12.974
- Me?
- Him.

39:13.267 --> 39:15.393
- How?
- Question and answer.

39:15.728 --> 39:16.770
He's afflicted.

39:16.937 --> 39:18.188
You question, I answer.

39:18.314 --> 39:19.439
He's not himself, you know.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.191
- I'm him, you see.
- Who am I?

39:21.359 --> 39:22.317
You're yourself.

39:22.443 --> 39:23.860
- And he's you?
- Not a bit of it.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.199
Are you afflicted?

39:29.950 --> 39:32.160
That's the idea.
Are you ready?

39:34.163 --> 39:35.288
Let's go back a bit.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.459
- I'm afflicted.
- I see.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.503
Glean what afflicts me.

39:41.629 --> 39:42.754
Right.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.672
Question and answer.

39:45.132 --> 39:46.216
How should I begin?

39:46.926 --> 39:47.967
Address me.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.887
My dear Guildenstern!

39:52.306 --> 39:53.723
You've forgotten, haven't you?

39:54.266 --> 39:55.517
My dear Rosencrantz!

39:59.730 --> 40:01.147
I don't think you
quite understand.

40:01.273 --> 40:02.899
What we are attempting
is a hypothesis

40:03.025 --> 40:04.651
in which I answer for him

40:04.777 --> 40:08.029
while you ask me questions.

40:09.156 --> 40:11.533
Ah. Ready?

40:12.451 --> 40:14.619
- You know what to do?
- What?

40:15.788 --> 40:17.372
- Are you stupid?
- Pardon?

40:17.498 --> 40:18.998
- Are you deaf?
- Did you speak?

40:19.125 --> 40:20.125
- Not now.
- Statement!

40:20.251 --> 40:25.046
Not now!

41:03.711 --> 41:04.836
I say.

41:04.962 --> 41:09.966
- What?
- Well, uh, uh...

41:12.386 --> 41:13.470
Would you like a bite?

41:14.263 --> 41:15.388
No.

41:20.811 --> 41:21.895
Thank you.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.708
Oh, you mean you
pretend to be him.

41:45.085 --> 41:47.086
And I ask you questions.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.380
Very good.

41:50.007 --> 41:51.132
You had me confused.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.634
I could see I had.

41:53.093 --> 41:54.260
How should I begin?

41:54.720 --> 41:55.845
Address me.

41:57.056 --> 41:58.223
My honored lord!

41:58.390 --> 41:59.724
My dear Rosencrantz!

42:01.936 --> 42:03.478
Am I pretending
to be you, then?

42:03.604 --> 42:06.523
Certainly not. Well,
if you like, shall we continue?

42:08.359 --> 42:10.818
- My honored lord!
- My dear fellow!

42:10.945 --> 42:12.070
- How are you?
- Afflicted!

42:12.196 --> 42:13.404
- Really? In what way?
- Transformed.

42:13.531 --> 42:14.572
- Inside or out?
- Both.

42:14.698 --> 42:18.326
I see. Not much new there.

42:18.452 --> 42:23.081
Look go into details! Delve!

42:28.212 --> 42:29.504
Probe the background.

42:30.965 --> 42:32.507
Establish the situation.

42:39.515 --> 42:41.140
So your uncle's
the king of Denmark?

42:41.267 --> 42:43.476
That's right.
And my father before him.

42:43.602 --> 42:44.811
His father before him?

42:44.937 --> 42:46.729
No, my father before him.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.773
- But surely...
- You may well ask.

42:49.358 --> 42:50.567
Let me get it straight.

42:52.152 --> 42:53.653
Your father was king.
You were his only son.

42:53.779 --> 42:55.947
Your father dies. You are of
age. Your uncle becomes king.

42:56.115 --> 42:57.240
- Yes.
- Unusual.

42:57.366 --> 42:58.449
- Undid me.
- Undeniably.

42:58.576 --> 42:59.534
- He slipped in.
- Which reminds me.

42:59.660 --> 43:00.910
- Well, it would.
- I don't want to be personal.

43:01.036 --> 43:02.036
It's common knowledge.

43:02.162 --> 43:03.329
- Your mother's marriage.
- He slipped in.

43:03.455 --> 43:05.290
- His body was still warm.
- So was hers.

43:05.416 --> 43:06.457
- Extraordinary.
- Indecent.

43:06.584 --> 43:07.584
- Hasty.
- Suspicious.

43:07.710 --> 43:08.876
- It makes you think.
- Don't think I haven't.

43:09.003 --> 43:10.587
- And with her husband's brother.
- They were close.

43:10.713 --> 43:11.713
- She went to him.
- Too close.

43:11.839 --> 43:12.839
- For comfort.
- It looks bad.

43:12.965 --> 43:13.965
- It adds up.
- Incest to adultery.

43:14.091 --> 43:15.216
- Would you go so far?
- Never!

43:15.342 --> 43:16.384
To sum up!

43:17.219 --> 43:19.512
Your father, whom
you love, dies.

43:19.638 --> 43:21.514
You are his heir.
You come back

43:21.640 --> 43:22.849
to find that hardly
was the corpse cold

43:22.975 --> 43:24.767
before his young brother
popped onto his throne

43:24.893 --> 43:26.227
and into his sheets,
thereby offending

43:26.353 --> 43:27.478
both legal and natural practice.

43:27.605 --> 43:30.023
Now, why exactly
are you behaving

43:30.149 --> 43:31.691
in this extraordinary manner?

43:32.359 --> 43:33.776
I can't imagine!

43:36.363 --> 43:38.072
And yet we were sent for.

43:43.871 --> 43:45.455
And we did come.

44:04.224 --> 44:05.308
Rosencrantz.

44:06.894 --> 44:08.978
- What?
- Guildenstern.

44:09.271 --> 44:10.438
What?

44:10.564 --> 44:12.398
Don't you discriminate at all?

44:12.816 --> 44:13.816
What?

44:14.360 --> 44:15.360
Nothing.

44:20.282 --> 44:21.324
Look at this.

44:27.039 --> 44:28.414
Watch closely.

44:37.549 --> 44:38.675
Interesting.

45:00.155 --> 45:02.699
Will you walk out
of the air, my lord?

45:03.742 --> 45:04.951
Into my grave?

45:05.160 --> 45:07.328
Indeed, that is out of the air.

45:12.126 --> 45:13.876
My honorable lord.

45:17.131 --> 45:19.549
I would, most humbly,
take my leave of you.

45:20.134 --> 45:21.801
You cannot, sir,
take from me anything

45:21.969 --> 45:24.387
that I will more
willingly part with all.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.264
Except my life.

45:27.433 --> 45:29.100
Except my life.

45:29.810 --> 45:31.561
Except my life.

45:33.147 --> 45:34.522
Fare you well, my lord.

45:37.776 --> 45:39.652
These tedious old fools.

45:42.489 --> 45:44.282
You go to seek
the Lord Hamlet?

45:45.451 --> 45:46.617
There he is.

45:58.922 --> 46:00.047
What's he doing?

46:00.799 --> 46:01.841
Talking.

46:05.053 --> 46:06.304
To himself.

46:14.021 --> 46:16.022
- My honored lord!
- My most dear lord!

46:18.859 --> 46:20.985
My excellent good friends!

46:21.153 --> 46:22.820
How dost thou, Guildenstern?

46:23.405 --> 46:25.198
- Ah, Rosencrantz!
- Pleased, sir!

46:25.324 --> 46:28.117
Oh, good lads, how do you both?

46:28.285 --> 46:29.827
As the indifferent
children of the earth.

46:29.995 --> 46:31.204
Happy that we are
not over-happy.

46:31.330 --> 46:33.372
On fortune's cap we are
not the very button.

46:33.499 --> 46:35.208
- Nor the soles of her shoes.
- Neither, my lord.

46:35.334 --> 46:38.085
Then you live about her waist,
or in the middle of her favors?

46:38.212 --> 46:39.420
Faith, her privates we.

46:39.588 --> 46:41.631
In the secret
parts of fortune?

46:42.424 --> 46:45.218
O, most true! She is a strumpet.

46:46.553 --> 46:47.678
Well, what news?

46:47.846 --> 46:49.806
None, my lord, but that
the world's grown honest.

46:49.932 --> 46:51.516
Then is doomsday near.

46:51.850 --> 46:53.559
But your news is not true.

46:53.894 --> 46:55.895
Let me question
more in particular.

46:56.021 --> 46:57.688
What have you, my good friends,

46:57.815 --> 46:59.857
deserved at the hands of
fortune that she sends you

47:00.025 --> 47:01.234
to prison hither?

47:01.360 --> 47:02.527
Prison, my lord?

47:03.779 --> 47:04.987
Denmark's a prison.

47:05.113 --> 47:06.405
Then is the world one?

47:06.573 --> 47:07.740
A goodly one,

47:07.908 --> 47:10.701
in which there are many
confines, wards and dungeons,

47:10.828 --> 47:12.620
Denmark being one of the worst.

47:12.788 --> 47:14.038
We think not so, my lord.

47:14.498 --> 47:17.375
Why, then 'tis none to you,
for there is nothing either

47:17.543 --> 47:20.169
good or bad but
thinking makes it so.

47:21.129 --> 47:22.338
To me it is a prison.

47:22.464 --> 47:24.215
Why then your
ambition makes it one.

47:24.341 --> 47:25.675
'Tis too narrow for your mind.

47:25.801 --> 47:28.636
Oh, God, I could be
bounded in a nutshell

47:28.762 --> 47:31.013
and count myself a
king of infinite space

47:31.431 --> 47:34.392
were it not that
I have bad dreams.

47:38.063 --> 47:39.313
But in the beaten
way of friendship,

47:39.439 --> 47:40.648
what make you at Elsinore?

47:40.774 --> 47:42.942
To visit you, my lord.
No other occasion.

47:43.068 --> 47:45.278
Beggar that I am,
I am even poor in thanks,

47:46.029 --> 47:47.071
but I thank you.

47:48.615 --> 47:50.116
Were you not sent for?

47:56.081 --> 47:57.707
Is it your own inclining?

47:59.459 --> 48:01.294
Is it a free visitation?

48:02.713 --> 48:04.589
Well, come, come, nay, speak.

48:04.798 --> 48:06.340
What should we say, my lord?

48:06.550 --> 48:09.176
Why, anything
but to the purpose.

48:09.344 --> 48:10.803
You were sent for.

48:11.513 --> 48:13.598
And there is a kind of
confession in your looks

48:13.724 --> 48:16.559
which your modesties have
not craft enough to color.

48:16.727 --> 48:19.896
I know the good king and
queen have sent for you.

48:20.105 --> 48:21.230
To what end, my lord?

48:21.356 --> 48:22.857
That you must teach me.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.776
Be even and direct with me,

48:25.903 --> 48:27.570
whether you were sent for or no.

48:27.696 --> 48:29.196
My lord, we were sent for.

48:29.323 --> 48:30.364
Aha.

48:34.536 --> 48:37.079
I will tell you why.

49:01.563 --> 49:05.399
I know he finds it striking
too short at Greeks.

49:05.525 --> 49:08.402
His antique sword
rebellious to his arm

49:08.528 --> 49:11.364
lies where it falls,
repugnant to command.

49:18.664 --> 49:19.914
I have of late,

49:21.625 --> 49:23.834
but wherefore I know not,

49:24.670 --> 49:26.337
lost all my mirth,

49:26.755 --> 49:29.882
foregone all custom
of exercises,

49:30.384 --> 49:35.012
and indeed, it goes so
heavily with my disposition

49:35.180 --> 49:37.431
that this goodly
frame, the earth,

49:37.599 --> 49:40.101
seems to me a
sterile promontory.

49:40.686 --> 49:43.646
This most excellent
canopy, the air,

49:43.772 --> 49:47.274
look you, this brave
o'er hanging firmament

49:47.442 --> 49:51.237
this majestical roof
fretted with golden fire...

49:52.739 --> 49:54.073
Why,

49:55.158 --> 49:57.952
it appeareth nothing to me
but a foul and pestilent

49:58.078 --> 50:00.246
congregation of vapors.

50:03.917 --> 50:05.835
What piece of work is man?

50:08.088 --> 50:09.505
How noble in reason,

50:11.758 --> 50:13.259
how infinite in faculties,

50:13.593 --> 50:17.013
in form and moving how
express and admirable,

50:17.264 --> 50:18.681
in action how like an angel,

50:18.849 --> 50:21.017
in apprehension how like a god.

50:21.268 --> 50:22.852
The beauty of the world.

50:23.061 --> 50:26.564
The paragon of animals,
and yet to me,

50:27.858 --> 50:30.317
what is this
quintessence of dust?

50:32.529 --> 50:34.363
Man delights not me.

50:36.950 --> 50:40.619
Nor woman neither, though by
your smiling you seem to say so.

50:40.912 --> 50:44.248
My lord, there was no
such stuff in my thoughts.

50:44.374 --> 50:45.583
Why did you laugh then,

50:45.709 --> 50:47.543
when I said "Man
delights not me"?

50:48.253 --> 50:51.172
To think, my lord, if
you delight not in man,

50:51.798 --> 50:54.592
what Lenten
entertainment the players

50:54.718 --> 50:56.093
shall receive from you.

50:56.887 --> 50:58.345
We coted them on the way,

50:58.638 --> 51:00.848
and hither are they coming
to offer you service.

51:01.224 --> 51:04.101
He that plays
the king shall be welcome.

51:05.645 --> 51:07.897
Gentleman, you are
welcome to Elsinore.

51:08.065 --> 51:10.191
Your hands, come then.
You are welcome.

51:12.277 --> 51:17.239
But my uncle-father and
my aunt-mother are deceived.

51:17.991 --> 51:19.325
In what, my dear lord?

51:21.161 --> 51:25.164
I am but mad north-northwest.

51:25.999 --> 51:30.127
When the wind is southerly
I know a hawk from a handsaw.

51:33.548 --> 51:35.174
Well be with you, gentleman.

51:36.510 --> 51:37.927
Hark you, Guildenstern.

51:38.220 --> 51:41.722
And you too,
at each ear a hearer.

51:41.973 --> 51:43.974
That great baby you see there

51:44.142 --> 51:46.769
is not yet out of
his swaddling clouts.

51:46.895 --> 51:49.230
I will prophesy he comes
to tell me of the players.

51:49.356 --> 51:52.399
My lord,
I have news to tell you.

51:52.526 --> 51:55.653
My lord, I have
news to tell you!

51:55.779 --> 51:58.531
When Roscius was
an actor in Rome--

51:58.782 --> 52:00.908
The actors are
come hither, my lord.

52:01.076 --> 52:02.368
Buzz, buzz.

52:02.494 --> 52:03.577
Upon my honor.

52:03.703 --> 52:05.830
Then came each
actor on his ass.

52:05.956 --> 52:08.249
The best
actors in the world,

52:08.375 --> 52:10.042
either for tragedy, comedy,

52:10.168 --> 52:12.670
history, pastoral,
pastoral-comical,

52:12.796 --> 52:14.505
historical-pastoral...

52:22.848 --> 52:24.807
- I thought you...
- No.

53:49.559 --> 53:51.602
I say, look at this!

54:21.299 --> 54:22.967
I think we can say
we made some progress.

54:24.094 --> 54:25.970
- You think so?
- I think we can say that.

54:26.263 --> 54:28.097
I think we can say he
made us look ridiculous.

54:29.766 --> 54:31.350
We played it close
to the chest of course.

54:31.893 --> 54:33.435
Question and answer!

54:33.728 --> 54:36.021
He was scoring off
us all down the line.

54:37.023 --> 54:38.232
He caught us on the
wrong foot once or twice,

54:38.358 --> 54:39.566
but I think we
gained some ground.

54:39.693 --> 54:41.026
- He murdered us.
- He might have had the edge.

54:41.152 --> 54:43.237
27-3, and you think
he might have had the edge?

54:43.363 --> 54:45.155
- He murdered us.
- What about our evasions?

54:45.282 --> 54:47.074
Oh, our evasions were lovely.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.201
"You were sent for?" he says.

54:49.661 --> 54:51.120
"My lord, we were sent for."

54:51.246 --> 54:52.329
I didn't know
where to put myself.

54:52.455 --> 54:53.580
He had six rhetoricals.

54:53.707 --> 54:54.707
It was question
and answer, all right?

54:54.833 --> 54:55.833
And two repetitions.

54:56.001 --> 54:57.584
27 questions he got
out and answered three.

54:57.711 --> 54:59.420
I was waiting for you to delve.

54:59.921 --> 55:02.256
When is he going to start
delving, I asked myself.

55:03.216 --> 55:04.925
We got his symptoms, didn't we?

55:05.885 --> 55:07.720
Half of what
he said meant something else,

55:07.846 --> 55:09.638
and the other half didn't
mean anything at all.

55:09.806 --> 55:11.974
Thwarted ambition,
a sense of grievance,

55:12.100 --> 55:13.142
that's my diagnosis.

55:13.268 --> 55:15.102
Six rhetorical
and two repetition,

55:15.228 --> 55:16.812
leaving nineteen of which
we answered fifteen.

55:16.980 --> 55:19.648
And what did we get in
return? He's depressed!

55:19.899 --> 55:23.235
Denmark's a prison and he'd
rather live in a nutshell.

55:23.695 --> 55:25.654
Some shadow play about
the nature of ambition

55:25.780 --> 55:28.782
and finally one direct question
which might've led somewhere

55:28.908 --> 55:30.451
and led in fact to
his illuminating claim

55:30.577 --> 55:31.744
to tell a hawk from a handbag.

55:31.911 --> 55:33.412
- Handsaw.
- Handsaw.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.665
- When the wind is southerly.
- And the weather's clear.

55:36.833 --> 55:38.375
And when it isn't he can't.

55:38.543 --> 55:40.336
He's at the mercy
of the elements.

55:47.427 --> 55:48.635
Is that southerly?

55:48.970 --> 55:51.013
We came from roughly south.

55:53.600 --> 55:54.850
Which way is that?

55:55.769 --> 55:57.644
In the morning the
sun would be easterly.

55:57.771 --> 55:59.438
I think we can assume that.

55:59.773 --> 56:01.065
That it's morning?

56:02.067 --> 56:04.735
If it is,
and the sun is over there,

56:04.861 --> 56:07.613
for instance,
that would be northerly.

56:08.907 --> 56:10.282
On the other hand,
if it is not morning

56:10.408 --> 56:13.952
and the sun is over there,
that would still be northerly.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.332
To put it another way,

56:19.709 --> 56:21.835
if we came from down there,
and it's morning,

56:21.961 --> 56:23.212
the sun would be up there.

56:23.797 --> 56:26.048
But if is actually over there,
and it's still morning,

56:26.216 --> 56:27.800
we must have come
from back there.

56:28.301 --> 56:29.635
And if that is southerly,

56:29.761 --> 56:32.012
and the sun is
really over there,

56:34.641 --> 56:35.933
then it's the afternoon.

56:39.604 --> 56:42.231
However, if none of
these is the case--

56:42.357 --> 56:44.566
Why don't you go
and have a look?

56:44.943 --> 56:47.945
Pragmatism.
Is that all you have to offer?

56:49.697 --> 56:53.617
I merely suggest the position
of the sun, if it is out,

56:53.827 --> 56:56.578
would give you a rough
idea of the time.

56:57.205 --> 57:00.249
Alternatively, the clock,
if it is going,

57:00.375 --> 57:02.501
would give you a rough idea
of the position of the sun.

57:02.669 --> 57:05.254
I forget which you are
trying to establish.

57:05.964 --> 57:09.508
I am trying to establish
the direction of the wind.

57:09.634 --> 57:12.636
There isn't any wind.

57:18.101 --> 57:20.602
Draft, yes.

57:48.173 --> 57:51.967
Pyrrhus at Priam
drives, in rage strikes wide.

57:52.302 --> 57:54.845
But with the whiff and
wind of his fell sword,

57:54.971 --> 57:57.473
the unnerved father falls.

57:57.891 --> 58:00.184
Then senseless Ilium,

58:00.351 --> 58:04.521
seeming to feel his blow,
with flaming top,

58:04.772 --> 58:06.482
stoops to his base,

58:06.733 --> 58:09.568
and with a hideous crash

58:10.195 --> 58:13.655
takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear.

58:13.823 --> 58:18.118
For lo, his sword
which was declining

58:18.244 --> 58:20.537
on the milky head
of reverend Priam...

58:32.258 --> 58:33.342
Mind the bottom...

58:34.302 --> 58:35.385
step.

58:37.555 --> 58:38.555
Sorry.

58:47.857 --> 58:50.734
Aroused
vengeance sets him new awork,

58:51.194 --> 58:54.863
and never did the Cyclops'
hammers fall on Mars's armor,

58:55.198 --> 58:57.074
forged for proof eterne,

58:57.367 --> 59:00.327
with less remorse than
Pyrrhus bleeding sword

59:00.578 --> 59:03.622
now falls on Priam.

59:05.083 --> 59:09.753
Out! Out, thou
strumpet Fortune!

59:10.588 --> 59:13.840
All you gods, in general Synod

59:14.008 --> 59:15.884
take away her power,

59:16.052 --> 59:19.680
break all the spokes and
fellies from her wheel,

59:19.806 --> 59:22.057
and bowl the round knave

59:22.183 --> 59:24.893
down the hill of Heaven,

59:25.311 --> 59:28.063
as low as to the fiends.

59:28.231 --> 59:29.648
This is too long.

59:30.441 --> 59:32.317
It shall to the barber's,
with your beard.

59:32.443 --> 59:34.319
he's for a speech,

59:34.487 --> 59:36.738
or a tale of bawdry,
or he sleeps.

59:37.073 --> 59:38.865
Say on, come to Hecuba.

59:39.409 --> 59:42.077
But who, oh, who,

59:42.370 --> 59:45.122
had seen the mobled queen,

59:45.248 --> 59:46.331
The mobled queen?

59:46.457 --> 59:48.333
That's good,
mobled queen is good.

01:00:18.072 --> 01:00:19.364
- This is interesting.
- Shh.

01:00:21.659 --> 01:00:22.659
'Tis well.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.956
Good, my lord, will you see
the players well bestowed?

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:29.207
Do you hear?

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:30.417
Let them be well used,

01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:34.129
for they are the abstract and
brief chronicles of the time.

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:36.757
After your death, you were
better have a bad epitaph

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:38.675
than their ill report
while you live.

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:39.968
My lord,
I will use them

01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:41.595
according to their desert.

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.680
God's bodkin,
man, much better!

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:45.807
Use every man after his desert,

01:00:45.933 --> 01:00:47.851
and who shall scape whipping?

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:50.228
Use them after your
own honor and dignity.

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:52.939
The less they deserve, the
more merit is in your bounty.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.232
Take them in.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.484
Come, sirs.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.820
Follow him, friends,
we'll hear a play tomorrow.

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:02.115
Can you play the
Murder of Gonzago?

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:03.241
Ay, my lord.

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:04.826
We'll have
it tomorrow night.

01:01:04.952 --> 01:01:08.246
You could for a need study a
speech of some 12 or 16 lines

01:01:08.414 --> 01:01:10.374
which I would set
down and insert in it.

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:17.297
Follow that lord and
look you, mock him not.

01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:30.727
My good friends, I'll
leave you till night.

01:01:30.978 --> 01:01:32.604
You are welcome to Elsinore.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:33.980
Good, my lord.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.171
So you've caught up.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:46.923
Not yet, sir.

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.174
Now mind your tongue,
or we'll have it out

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:49.467
and throw the rest of you away

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:50.886
like a nightingale
at a Roman feast.

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:52.220
Took the words
out of my mouth.

01:04:52.346 --> 01:04:53.805
- You'd be lost for words.
- You'd be tongue tied.

01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:55.056
Like a mute in a monologue.

01:04:55.182 --> 01:04:57.601
Like a nightingale
at a Roman feast.

01:04:58.519 --> 01:04:59.644
You left us.

01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:01.688
Yes, on the road.

01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:03.982
You don't understand
the humiliation of it,

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:06.985
to be tricked out of
the single assumption

01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:09.070
that makes our
existence bearable.

01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:11.489
That somebody is watching.

01:05:11.782 --> 01:05:14.868
We are actors, we are
the opposite of people.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:19.039
- So?
- We need an audience.

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:22.918
- We--
- Had an appointment.

01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:25.462
That is true.

01:05:44.815 --> 01:05:46.608
Do you know
why you're here?

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:48.693
We only know what we're told

01:05:48.819 --> 01:05:51.029
and for all we know,
it isn't even true.

01:05:51.155 --> 01:05:52.405
One acts on assumptions.

01:05:52.531 --> 01:05:53.698
What do you assume?

01:05:54.575 --> 01:05:56.451
Hamlet is not himself
outside or in.

01:05:56.577 --> 01:05:58.161
We have to glean
what afflicts him.

01:05:58.287 --> 01:05:59.829
- His melancholy.
- Melancholy?

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.206
- Mad.
- How is he mad?

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:03.416
Ah! How's he mad?

01:06:03.584 --> 01:06:05.293
More morose than mad perhaps.

01:06:05.419 --> 01:06:06.795
- Melancholy.
- Moody.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.588
- He has moods.
- Of moroseness?

01:06:08.714 --> 01:06:10.006
- Madness and yet.
- Quite.

01:06:10.174 --> 01:06:11.216
For instance.

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:14.010
He talks to himself
which might be madness.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.720
If he didn't talk sense,
which he does.

01:06:15.846 --> 01:06:17.097
Which
suggests the opposite.

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:18.556
Of what?

01:06:19.558 --> 01:06:21.059
I think I have it.

01:06:22.436 --> 01:06:24.396
A man talking sense to himself

01:06:24.605 --> 01:06:28.608
is no madder than a man talking
nonsense not to himself.

01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:30.068
- Or just as mad.
- Or just as mad.

01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:31.319
- And he does both.
- So there you are.

01:06:31.445 --> 01:06:32.612
Stark raving sane.

01:06:32.738 --> 01:06:33.822
Why?

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.074
Ah. Why?

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.409
Exactly.

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:40.662
Exactly what?

01:06:41.747 --> 01:06:43.623
- Exactly why?
- Exactly why what?

01:06:43.749 --> 01:06:44.958
- What?
- Why?

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:47.627
- Why what, exactly?
- Why is he mad?

01:06:47.753 --> 01:06:50.588
- I don't know!
- The old man thinks

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:54.175
he's in love with his daughter.

01:06:54.301 --> 01:06:57.095
Good God, we're out
of our depth here!

01:06:57.221 --> 01:07:00.098
No, no, no,
he hasn't got a daughter,

01:07:00.224 --> 01:07:02.892
The old man thinks
he's in love with his daughter.

01:07:06.063 --> 01:07:07.439
The old man is?

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:11.985
Hamlet, in love,

01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:15.739
with the old man's daughter.

01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:19.659
The old man thinks.

01:07:25.624 --> 01:07:27.125
It's
beginning to make sense.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:28.752
Unrequited passion.

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:35.675
Where are you going?

01:07:35.968 --> 01:07:37.719
I can come and go as I please.

01:07:38.095 --> 01:07:39.179
You know your way around.

01:07:39.346 --> 01:07:40.597
I've been here before.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.098
We're
still finding our feet.

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:44.851
I should concentrate
on not losing your heads.

01:07:44.977 --> 01:07:46.061
Do you speak from knowledge?

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:47.353
Precedent.

01:07:48.105 --> 01:07:49.355
You've been here before.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.983
And I know which way
the wind is blowing.

01:08:15.841 --> 01:08:17.926
Wait! Back!

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:30.854
This place is a mad house.

01:09:32.459 --> 01:09:33.877
He's behind you!

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:41.843
Bravo!

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:14.449
Are you
familiar with this play?

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:15.700
No.

01:14:20.038 --> 01:14:24.375
A slaughterhouse,
eight corpses, all told.

01:14:27.921 --> 01:14:29.005
Six.

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:30.298
Eight.

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:34.385
What are they?

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:36.679
They're dead.

01:14:47.357 --> 01:14:49.150
Actors!
What do you know about death?

01:14:49.401 --> 01:14:50.526
The mechanics of
cheap melodrama!

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:51.694
Cheap melodrama!

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:52.945
It doesn't bring
death home to anyone!

01:14:53.071 --> 01:14:54.071
It's not at home to anyone!

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:55.239
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

01:14:55.365 --> 01:14:56.491
You can't do death!

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.659
On the contrary,
it's what we do best.

01:14:58.952 --> 01:15:01.370
We have to exploit whatever
talent is given to us

01:15:01.538 --> 01:15:03.789
and our talent is for dying.

01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:06.834
We can die heroically,
comically, ironically,

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.630
sadly, suddenly, slowly,
disgustingly, charmingly,

01:15:11.131 --> 01:15:12.757
or from a great height.

01:15:15.969 --> 01:15:17.720
Audiences know what to expect,

01:15:18.722 --> 01:15:21.015
and that is all they are
prepared to believe in.

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:46.791
Next!

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.669
Can you by
no drift of conference

01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:52.380
get from him why he
puts on his confusion?

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:56.175
He does confess
he feels himself distracted.

01:15:56.593 --> 01:15:59.345
But from what cause he
will by no means speak.

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.379
That is the question.

01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:37.258
Did he receive you well?

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:39.385
Most like a gentleman.

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:41.637
But with much forcing
of his disposition.

01:16:41.972 --> 01:16:44.223
Niggard of question
but of our demands,

01:16:44.349 --> 01:16:46.183
most free in his reply.

01:16:47.519 --> 01:16:49.604
Did you
assay him to any pastime?

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.899
Madam, it so
fell out that certain players

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:56.986
we o'er-raught on the
way, of these we told him,

01:16:57.529 --> 01:17:00.281
and there did seem in him a
kind of joy to hear of it.

01:17:01.658 --> 01:17:03.659
They are here about the court,

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.328
this night to play before him.

01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:07.079
'Tis most true,

01:17:07.372 --> 01:17:10.041
and he beseeched me to
entreat your Majesties

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:12.501
to hear and see the matter.

01:17:12.669 --> 01:17:13.919
Good gentlemen,

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:18.215
give him a further edge
and drive his purpose

01:17:18.383 --> 01:17:19.925
into these delights.

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:22.511
We shall, my lord.

01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:28.142
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too.

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:31.479
For we have closely
sent for Hamlet hither,

01:17:31.855 --> 01:17:35.066
that he, as 'twere by accident,

01:17:35.233 --> 01:17:37.526
may here affront Ophelia.

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:58.839
Do you ever think of
yourself as actually dead

01:17:59.049 --> 01:18:00.966
lying in a box with a lid on it?

01:18:01.134 --> 01:18:02.176
No.

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:04.303
Nor do I really.

01:18:06.139 --> 01:18:08.182
It's silly to be
depressed by it.

01:18:09.142 --> 01:18:11.894
I mean, one thinks of it
like being alive in a box,

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:14.730
and one keeps forgetting to
take into account the fact

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:19.068
that one is dead, which should
make all the difference,

01:18:20.278 --> 01:18:21.487
shouldn't it?

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:26.242
I mean, you'd never know you
were in a box, would you?

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:30.079
It would be just like
you were asleep in a box.

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:34.208
Not that I'd like to
sleep in a box, mind you.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.377
Not without any air.

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:39.130
You'd wake up dead for a start,
and then where would you be?

01:18:41.007 --> 01:18:44.802
In a box. That's the bit
I don't like frankly.

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:47.054
That's why don't think of it.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.440
Because you'd be
helpless, wouldn't you?

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.109
Stuffed in a box like that.

01:19:00.944 --> 01:19:02.903
I mean, you'd be
in there forever.

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:05.698
Even taking into account
the fact that you're dead,

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:07.658
it isn't a pleasant thought.

01:19:08.869 --> 01:19:10.870
Especially if
you're dead, really.

01:19:11.621 --> 01:19:12.747
Ask yourself,

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:16.208
if I asked you straight off,

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.669
I'm going to stuff
you in this box now,

01:19:18.795 --> 01:19:20.504
would you rather
be alive or dead?

01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:22.757
Naturally, you
prefer to be alive.

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:26.218
Life in a box is better
than no life at all,

01:19:27.679 --> 01:19:28.763
I expect.

01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:31.599
You'd have a chance at least.

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:33.893
You could lie there
thinking, well,

01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:38.773
at least I'm not dead!

01:19:39.691 --> 01:19:42.109
In a minute somebody is
going to bang on the lid

01:19:42.235 --> 01:19:43.527
and tell me to come out.

01:19:45.697 --> 01:19:47.782
Hey, you! What's your name!

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.450
Come out of there!

01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:56.415
I think I'm going to kill you.

01:20:51.304 --> 01:20:55.808
Nymph, in thy orisons
be all my sins remembered.

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:01.856
I wouldn't think
about it, if I were you.

01:21:02.607 --> 01:21:04.191
You'd only get depressed.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:13.534
My lord,

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.871
I have remembrances of yours

01:21:17.789 --> 01:21:20.165
that I have long had
long to redeliver.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.669
I pray you now receive them.

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:28.424
No, not I. I never
gave you ought.

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:32.261
My honored lord, you
know right well you did.

01:21:32.929 --> 01:21:34.847
And with them words
of so sweet breath

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:37.224
composed as made the
things more rich.

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:01.498
Whatever
became of the moment

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.835
when one first knew about death?

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.670
There must have been one,

01:22:07.505 --> 01:22:08.672
a moment,

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.258
in childhood,

01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:13.677
when it first occurred to you

01:22:13.803 --> 01:22:15.596
that you don't go on forever.

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:18.307
It must have been shattering,

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:21.435
stamped into one's memory.

01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:26.190
And yet I can't remember it.

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.151
It never occurred to me at all.

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:31.737
We must be born

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:34.239
with an intuition of mortality.

01:22:35.241 --> 01:22:36.825
Before we know the word for it,

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.620
before we know that
there are words,

01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:43.707
out we come, bloodied
and squalling,

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:46.794
with the knowledge that for
all the points of the compass,

01:22:48.713 --> 01:22:50.297
there's only one direction,

01:22:51.716 --> 01:22:54.635
and time is its only measure.

01:26:10.915 --> 01:26:12.541
What is the dumb show for?

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:14.960
it's
a device, really.

01:26:15.086 --> 01:26:16.253
It makes the action that follows

01:26:16.379 --> 01:26:18.839
more or less comprehensible.

01:26:18.965 --> 01:26:20.340
You understand,

01:26:20.466 --> 01:26:22.467
we are tied down to a language
which makes up in obscurity

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:24.678
what it lacks in style.

01:26:24.804 --> 01:26:27.306
Is this the
'Murder of Gonzago?

01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:30.809
That's the least of it.

01:26:30.935 --> 01:26:32.269
Who was that?

01:26:32.395 --> 01:26:36.481
The king's
brother and uncle to the prince.

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:42.821
Not exactly fraternal.

01:26:42.947 --> 01:26:46.617
Not exactly avuncular
as time goes on.

01:27:25.323 --> 01:27:28.450
Go to,
I'll no more on't!

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:30.786
It hath made me mad!

01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:35.165
I say we will have
no more marriages!

01:27:39.003 --> 01:27:40.921
Those that are married already,

01:27:41.047 --> 01:27:44.508
all but one shall live.

01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:47.219
The rest shall keep as they are.

01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:50.722
To a nunnery, go!

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:56.270
That didn't look
like love to me.

01:27:56.396 --> 01:27:58.981
Love!

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:02.317
His affections do
not that way tend,

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:06.780
Nor what he spake, though
it lacked form a little,

01:28:06.906 --> 01:28:08.282
was not like madness.

01:28:08.408 --> 01:28:09.825
Polonius How now Ophelia.

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:13.912
You need not tell us what Lord
Hamlet said, we heard it all.

01:28:15.039 --> 01:28:16.498
There's something in his soul

01:28:16.624 --> 01:28:18.917
o'er which his
melancholy sits on brood.

01:28:19.043 --> 01:28:20.752
And I do doubt the
hatch and the disclose

01:28:20.878 --> 01:28:23.755
will be some danger,
which for to prevent,

01:28:23.881 --> 01:28:25.424
I have in quick determination.

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:28.093
Thus set it down, he shall
with speed to England.

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:41.565
Gentlemen! Gentlemen, it
doesn't seem to be coming.

01:28:43.526 --> 01:28:46.737
We are not getting it at all,
what did you think?

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.363
What was I supposed to think?

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.823
Wasn't that the end?

01:28:49.949 --> 01:28:51.241
Do you call that an ending?

01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:53.410
With practically everyone
still on his feet?

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:56.330
My goodness, no,
over your dead body.

01:28:56.956 --> 01:29:00.417
There's a design at work in
all art, surely you know that?

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:03.503
Events must play themselves
out to an aesthetic,

01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:05.464
moral, and logical conclusion.

01:29:05.631 --> 01:29:07.007
What's that in this case?

01:29:07.133 --> 01:29:08.383
It never varies.

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:10.969
We aim for the
point where everyone

01:29:11.095 --> 01:29:14.514
who is marked for death dies.

01:29:14.807 --> 01:29:15.849
Marked?

01:29:15.975 --> 01:29:18.101
Generally speaking,
things have gone

01:29:18.227 --> 01:29:19.728
about as far as
they can possibly go

01:29:19.937 --> 01:29:21.188
when things have
got about as bad

01:29:21.314 --> 01:29:22.981
as they can reasonably get.

01:29:23.441 --> 01:29:24.691
Who decides?

01:29:25.318 --> 01:29:27.986
Decides? It is written.

01:29:29.322 --> 01:29:30.405
We're tragedians, you see.

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:33.408
We follow directions,
there is no choice involved.

01:29:33.743 --> 01:29:38.163
The bad end unhappily,
the good unluckily.

01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:40.582
That is what tragedy means.

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:41.833
Next!

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:45.754
Having murdered his brother
and wooed his widow,

01:29:45.922 --> 01:29:48.006
the poisoner mounts the throne!

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:52.677
Here we see him and his queen

01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:55.430
give rein to their
unbridled passion!

01:29:56.808 --> 01:30:00.227
Enter Lucianus,
nephew to the king!

01:30:01.437 --> 01:30:04.523
Usurped by his
uncle and shattered

01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:06.733
by his mother's
incestuous marriage,

01:30:08.361 --> 01:30:09.611
he loses his reason.

01:30:12.323 --> 01:30:14.658
Throwing the court into turmoil

01:30:14.784 --> 01:30:18.870
and disarray,
staggering from the suicidal

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.039
to the merely idle.

01:30:21.207 --> 01:30:25.252
He has a plan to catch the
conscience of the king.

01:31:58.554 --> 01:31:59.721
The king rises!

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:02.474
What!
Frighted with false fire!

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:06.895
How fares my lord?

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:08.063
Give o'er the play!

01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:10.065
Give me some light!

01:32:10.274 --> 01:32:11.566
Away!

01:32:30.753 --> 01:32:33.713
A-ha! Thou must watch
while some must sleep,

01:32:33.839 --> 01:32:37.592
thus runs the world away!

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.810
It wasn't that bad!

01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:02.909
There's something
they're not telling us.

01:33:03.077 --> 01:33:04.077
What?

01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:06.913
There's something
they're not telling us!

01:33:27.852 --> 01:33:29.019
My lord.

01:33:33.983 --> 01:33:34.983
My lord.

01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:39.863
The queen would speak
with you, and presently.

01:33:40.531 --> 01:33:42.157
Do you see yonder cloud

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:44.326
that's almost
in the shape of a camel?

01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:47.912
By the mass,
and 'tis like a camel, indeed.

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:49.956
Me thinks it is like a weasel.

01:33:50.374 --> 01:33:51.833
It is backed like a weasel.

01:33:52.001 --> 01:33:54.502
- Or like a whale?
- Very like a whale.

01:33:55.338 --> 01:33:57.422
Then I will come to
my mother by and by.

01:33:57.632 --> 01:33:58.673
I will say so.

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:01.134
A "by and by"
is easily said.

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:09.184
Leave me, friends.

01:34:20.404 --> 01:34:22.656
I like him not,
nor stand it safe with us

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:24.449
to let his madness range.

01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:26.159
Therefore prepare you.

01:34:26.577 --> 01:34:28.953
I your commission will
forthwith will dispatch,

01:34:29.205 --> 01:34:31.414
and he to England
shall along with you.

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:45.387
No, by the rood, not so.

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:48.348
You are the queen,
your husband's brother's wife,

01:34:48.474 --> 01:34:50.642
but would you were not so,
you are my mother.

01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:54.521
Nay, then I'll set
those to you that can speak.

01:34:55.106 --> 01:34:57.065
Come, come and sit
you down, you shall not budge.

01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:59.275
You go not till
I sent you up a glass,

01:34:59.402 --> 01:35:01.486
where you may see
the in most part of you.

01:35:01.862 --> 01:35:04.406
What wilt thou do,
thou wilt not murder me.

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:05.990
Help! Help!

01:35:06.158 --> 01:35:07.742
Oh! Help! Help!

01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:11.538
How now! A rat?
Dead, for a ducat dead!

01:35:11.789 --> 01:35:14.332
Oh, I am slain!

01:35:15.418 --> 01:35:18.002
Oh, me,
what hast thou done?

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:20.171
Nay, I know not!

01:35:21.674 --> 01:35:22.757
Is it the king?

01:35:23.008 --> 01:35:26.469
Oh, what a rash
and bloody deed is this!

01:35:26.637 --> 01:35:29.639
A bloody deed almost
as bad, good mother,

01:35:29.765 --> 01:35:31.975
as kill a king and
marry with his brother.

01:35:32.101 --> 01:35:35.061
- As kill a king?
- Ay, lady, it was my word.

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:40.108
Thou wretched, rash,
intruding fool, farewell!

01:35:44.655 --> 01:35:45.947
Is that you?

01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:47.824
I don't know.

01:35:49.618 --> 01:35:50.827
It's you.

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:53.580
We're
not dead yet then?

01:35:53.789 --> 01:35:55.248
Well,
we're here, aren't we?

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:58.251
Are we?
I can't see a thing.

01:36:27.156 --> 01:36:28.531
We're on a boat.

01:36:29.492 --> 01:36:30.658
I know.

01:36:47.218 --> 01:36:48.384
Dark, isn't it?

01:36:49.428 --> 01:36:50.595
Not for night.

01:36:51.555 --> 01:36:54.265
No, not for night.

01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:56.476
It's dark for day.

01:36:56.852 --> 01:36:59.729
Oh, yes, it's dark for day.

01:37:08.948 --> 01:37:13.785
Do you think death could
possibly be a boat?

01:37:18.165 --> 01:37:21.292
No, no, no, death is not.

01:37:21.752 --> 01:37:22.919
Death isn't.

01:37:24.129 --> 01:37:25.255
You take my meaning?

01:37:25.631 --> 01:37:28.174
Death is the ultimate negative,
not being.

01:37:29.218 --> 01:37:30.927
You can't not be on a boat.

01:37:31.762 --> 01:37:33.638
I've frequently
not been on boats.

01:37:35.224 --> 01:37:37.976
No, no, what you've
been is not on boats.

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:41.729
I wish
I was dead.

01:37:48.028 --> 01:37:49.195
I could jump over the side.

01:37:49.321 --> 01:37:50.613
That would put a spoke
in their wheel.

01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:52.198
Unless they're counting on it.

01:37:52.324 --> 01:37:53.491
I shall remain on board.

01:37:53.617 --> 01:37:54.784
That will put a spoke
in their wheel.

01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:07.922
You all right?

01:38:08.799 --> 01:38:10.758
Yes, why?

01:38:11.302 --> 01:38:12.552
Would you like to come up now?

01:38:12.761 --> 01:38:14.387
All right,
thank you.

01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:19.684
Try to be more careful.

01:38:19.810 --> 01:38:20.894
Sorry.

01:38:23.272 --> 01:38:24.564
Nice bit of planking that.

01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:26.149
- Yes.
- Lovely bilges.

01:38:26.317 --> 01:38:27.984
- Yes.
- Beautiful bottom.

01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:30.069
Yes. I'm very fond
of boats myself.

01:38:30.779 --> 01:38:32.196
I like the way
they're contained.

01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:33.656
You don't have to worry
about which way to go,

01:38:33.824 --> 01:38:34.908
or whether to go at all.

01:38:35.034 --> 01:38:36.409
The question doesn't arise,
does it?

01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.036
Because you're on a boat,
aren't you?

01:38:38.829 --> 01:38:40.747
I think I'll spend
the rest of my life on boats.

01:38:41.624 --> 01:38:42.790
Very healthy.

01:38:43.125 --> 01:38:46.920
One is free on a boat.
For a time, relatively.

01:38:50.132 --> 01:38:51.925
I think I'm going to be sick.

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:16.824
He's there!

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:18.910
What's he doing?

01:39:19.536 --> 01:39:20.578
Sleeping.

01:39:21.914 --> 01:39:23.039
It's all right for him.

01:39:23.165 --> 01:39:25.083
- What is?
- He can sleep.

01:39:26.377 --> 01:39:27.627
It's all right for him.

01:39:28.587 --> 01:39:29.754
He's got us now.

01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:31.673
- He can sleep.
- It's all done for him.

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:33.758
- He's got us.
- And we've got nothing.

01:39:33.884 --> 01:39:35.218
And we've got nothing.

01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:38.179
Why don't you say
something original!

01:39:38.472 --> 01:39:39.764
You don't take me
up on anything.

01:39:39.932 --> 01:39:41.683
You just repeat everything
I say in a different order.

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:43.059
I can't think of
anything original.

01:39:43.394 --> 01:39:44.519
I am only good in support.

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:46.479
I'm sick of
making the running.

01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:00.410
There, it's all right,
I'll see we're all right.

01:40:01.495 --> 01:40:03.371
But we've got nothing
to go on.

01:40:03.998 --> 01:40:05.623
We're out on our own.

01:40:06.542 --> 01:40:08.001
We're on our way to England.

01:40:08.168 --> 01:40:10.169
We're taking Hamlet
to the English king.

01:40:10.295 --> 01:40:11.504
- What for?
- What for?

01:40:11.630 --> 01:40:13.631
- Where have you been?
- When?

01:40:14.341 --> 01:40:16.551
We've got a letter.
You remember the letter.

01:40:17.052 --> 01:40:18.052
Do I?

01:40:19.096 --> 01:40:21.472
Everything is
explained in the letter.

01:40:22.099 --> 01:40:24.100
- Is that it, then?
- What?

01:40:24.268 --> 01:40:25.518
We take Hamlet to
the English king,

01:40:25.644 --> 01:40:28.062
we hand over the letter,
what then?

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:33.026
That's it, we're finished.

01:40:33.569 --> 01:40:35.945
Who is the English king?

01:40:36.447 --> 01:40:38.740
That depends on
when we get there.

01:40:39.241 --> 01:40:41.492
So we've got a letter
which explains everything.

01:40:41.744 --> 01:40:42.952
You've got it.

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:45.288
- I thought you had it.
- I do have it.

01:40:45.414 --> 01:40:46.622
- You have it.
- You've got it.

01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:47.874
I don't get it.

01:40:48.083 --> 01:40:49.125
You haven't got it.

01:40:49.251 --> 01:40:50.668
- I just said that.
- I've got it.

01:40:51.628 --> 01:40:53.046
- Oh, I've got it.
- Shut up.

01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:54.505
Right.

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:01.304
What a shambles!

01:41:02.097 --> 01:41:03.598
We're just not getting anywhere!

01:41:03.932 --> 01:41:05.058
Not even England!

01:41:05.184 --> 01:41:06.934
And I don't believe
in it anyway.

01:41:07.102 --> 01:41:08.561
- In what?
- England.

01:41:08.687 --> 01:41:10.855
Just a conspiracy of
cartographers, you mean?

01:41:10.981 --> 01:41:12.565
I mean I don't believe it.

01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:15.276
And even if it's true,
the king of England

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:16.778
won't know what
we're taking about.

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:17.945
What are we going to say?

01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:21.407
We say, "Your Majesty,
we have arrived."

01:41:21.658 --> 01:41:22.825
And who are you?

01:41:22.951 --> 01:41:23.993
We are Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern.

01:41:24.119 --> 01:41:25.119
Never heard of you!

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:26.496
- Well, we're nobody special.
- What's your game?

01:41:26.622 --> 01:41:27.955
- We have our instructions,
- First I've heard of it.

01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:29.123
Let me finish!

01:41:30.501 --> 01:41:31.584
We've come from Denmark.

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:32.877
What do you want?

01:41:33.003 --> 01:41:34.837
Nothing.
We're delivering Hamlet.

01:41:34.963 --> 01:41:36.089
Who's he?

01:41:36.298 --> 01:41:37.465
You've heard of him.

01:41:37.633 --> 01:41:39.133
Oh, I've heard of him,
all right.

01:41:39.259 --> 01:41:40.510
Now, I want nothing
to do with it.

01:41:40.636 --> 01:41:42.178
You march in here without
so much as a by your leave

01:41:42.304 --> 01:41:43.721
and expect me to
take in every lunatic

01:41:43.847 --> 01:41:46.265
you try to pass off with
a lot of unsubstantiated--

01:41:46.475 --> 01:41:47.517
We've got a letter!

01:41:47.643 --> 01:41:50.311
I see, I see.

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:53.439
Well, this seems to support
your story, such as it is.

01:41:54.024 --> 01:41:55.817
It is an exact command
from the king of Denmark.

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:57.110
For several different reasons,

01:41:57.236 --> 01:41:59.153
importing Denmark's
health and England's too,

01:41:59.279 --> 01:42:01.072
that on the reading of
this letter, without delay,

01:42:01.198 --> 01:42:03.324
I should have
Hamlet's head cut off!

01:42:58.589 --> 01:43:00.089
We're his friends.

01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:02.633
How do you know?

01:43:02.885 --> 01:43:05.094
From our young days,
brought up with him.

01:43:05.387 --> 01:43:07.305
You've only got
their word for it.

01:43:08.432 --> 01:43:10.224
But that's what we depend on.

01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:12.768
Well, yes,

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:16.063
and then again no.

01:43:17.774 --> 01:43:19.400
Let us keep things
in proportion.

01:43:19.735 --> 01:43:22.653
Assume, if you like, that
they're going to kill him.

01:43:22.779 --> 01:43:24.572
Well, he is a man, he is mortal.

01:43:24.698 --> 01:43:26.115
Death comes to us
all, et cetera.

01:43:26.241 --> 01:43:28.492
And consequently he would have
died anyway, sooner or later.

01:43:29.494 --> 01:43:31.287
And then again, what is
so terrible about death?

01:43:31.413 --> 01:43:33.998
As Socrates so
philosophically put it,

01:43:34.124 --> 01:43:35.374
since we don't
know what death is,

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.710
it is illogical to fear it.
It might be

01:43:38.712 --> 01:43:39.795
very nice.

01:43:41.423 --> 01:43:44.091
Or to look at it another way,

01:43:44.301 --> 01:43:45.384
we are little men,

01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:46.886
we don't know the ins
and outs of the matter,

01:43:47.012 --> 01:43:48.596
there are wheels within
wheels, et cetera...

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:50.139
All in all, I think
we'd be well advised

01:43:50.265 --> 01:43:51.390
to leave well alone.

01:43:52.476 --> 01:43:53.684
It's awful.

01:43:54.478 --> 01:43:56.479
But it could have been worse.

01:44:00.984 --> 01:44:03.110
I was beginning to think it was.

01:44:34.810 --> 01:44:35.851
Night.

01:46:32.469 --> 01:46:35.429
Ah, all in the
same boat, then!

01:46:39.893 --> 01:46:41.519
What do you make of it so far?

01:46:42.312 --> 01:46:43.604
What's happening?

01:46:46.775 --> 01:46:47.858
Pirates.

01:46:49.486 --> 01:46:51.612
Everybody on stage!

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.647
Hamlet!

01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:39.470
Where's Hamlet?

01:48:39.971 --> 01:48:41.013
Gone.

01:48:41.139 --> 01:48:42.389
Gone where?

01:48:43.642 --> 01:48:44.975
The pirates took him.

01:48:47.687 --> 01:48:49.063
But they can't.

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:53.901
We're supposed to be,
we've got a letter which says,

01:48:54.528 --> 01:48:56.028
the whole thing's
pointless without him,

01:48:56.154 --> 01:48:58.030
we need Hamlet for our release!

01:48:59.491 --> 01:49:02.826
I'll pretend to be,
you pretend to be him and...

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:06.121
Right.

01:49:07.123 --> 01:49:08.624
I suppose we just go on.

01:49:08.917 --> 01:49:09.959
Go where?

01:49:10.544 --> 01:49:11.585
England?

01:49:11.711 --> 01:49:14.547
England! I don't believe it!

01:49:14.714 --> 01:49:17.341
Or just a conspiracy of
cartographers, you mean.

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:21.971
I mean I don't believe it
and even if it's true

01:49:22.097 --> 01:49:24.723
- what do we say?
- We say we've arrived!

01:49:24.933 --> 01:49:26.433
Who are you?

01:49:32.691 --> 01:49:34.608
We are Guildenstern
and Rosencrantz.

01:49:34.734 --> 01:49:36.986
- Which is which?
- Well, I'm Guildenstern--

01:49:37.112 --> 01:49:38.195
- And he's Rosencrantz.
- Exactly.

01:49:38.321 --> 01:49:39.655
What does this have to do
with me?

01:49:39.823 --> 01:49:42.366
You turn up out of the blue
with some cock and bull story.

01:49:42.492 --> 01:49:43.617
We have a letter.

01:49:43.743 --> 01:49:44.743
A letter?

01:49:49.374 --> 01:49:51.917
"As England is Denmark's
faithful tributary,

01:49:52.043 --> 01:49:53.210
as love between them

01:49:53.336 --> 01:49:55.170
like the palm
might flourish, et cetera.

01:49:55.338 --> 01:49:56.839
That on the knowing
of this contents,

01:49:56.965 --> 01:49:58.549
without delay of any kind,

01:49:58.675 --> 01:50:01.385
should those bearers,
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,

01:50:01.595 --> 01:50:03.304
put to sudden death."

01:50:04.764 --> 01:50:06.473
Not that letter,
give him the other one.

01:50:06.683 --> 01:50:08.017
I haven't got another one.

01:50:11.021 --> 01:50:12.229
They're gone!

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:14.607
It's all over!

01:50:17.527 --> 01:50:21.322
Where we went wrong,
was getting on a boat.

01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:22.740
They had it in
for us, didn't they?

01:50:22.866 --> 01:50:23.907
Right from the beginning.

01:50:24.034 --> 01:50:25.826
Who'd have thought that
we were so important?

01:50:25.952 --> 01:50:27.036
But why?

01:50:27.621 --> 01:50:29.872
Was it all for this?
Who are we that so much should

01:50:29.998 --> 01:50:31.457
converge on our little deaths?

01:50:31.625 --> 01:50:33.417
You are
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

01:50:33.543 --> 01:50:34.543
That is enough.

01:50:35.170 --> 01:50:36.545
No, it is not enough.

01:50:36.671 --> 01:50:38.797
To be told so little to
such an end and still,

01:50:38.923 --> 01:50:41.175
finally, to be denied
an explanation.

01:50:42.093 --> 01:50:44.511
In our experience, almost
everything ends in death.

01:50:44.763 --> 01:50:48.140
Your experience? Actors?

01:50:48.683 --> 01:50:51.352
I'm talking about death.
You've never experienced that.

01:50:51.478 --> 01:50:52.936
You die a thousand casual deaths

01:50:53.063 --> 01:50:54.563
and come back in
a different hat.

01:50:54.689 --> 01:50:56.732
But nobody gets up after death.

01:50:56.983 --> 01:50:58.233
There's no applause,

01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.736
only silence and some
secondhand clothes.

01:51:01.404 --> 01:51:02.529
That's death!

01:51:16.127 --> 01:51:17.961
If we have a destiny,
then so had he,

01:51:18.088 --> 01:51:19.797
and if this is ours,
then that was his

01:51:19.923 --> 01:51:21.256
and if there are no
explanations for us,

01:51:21.383 --> 01:51:22.841
then let there be none for him.

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:34.144
Oh, come, come, gentlemen.

01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:36.605
No flattery,
it was merely competent.

01:51:38.441 --> 01:51:41.694
You see, it is the
kind you do believe in.

01:51:45.281 --> 01:51:46.740
It's what is expected.

01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:49.410
Death's for all ages
and occasions!

01:52:20.233 --> 01:52:23.152
Deaths of kings
and princes and...

01:52:25.488 --> 01:52:26.697
nobodies.

01:52:40.962 --> 01:52:42.212
That's it then, is it?

01:52:46.551 --> 01:52:47.801
We've done nothing wrong.

01:52:47.927 --> 01:52:49.344
We didn't harm anyone, did we?

01:52:50.013 --> 01:52:51.305
I can't remember.

01:52:55.101 --> 01:52:56.351
All right, then.

01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:58.687
I don't care.

01:52:59.606 --> 01:53:00.731
I've had enough.

01:53:01.399 --> 01:53:03.650
To tell you the truth,
I'm relieved.

01:53:04.486 --> 01:53:06.236
There must have been a moment

01:53:07.405 --> 01:53:09.198
at the beginning where
we could have said no.

01:53:11.826 --> 01:53:13.243
But somehow we missed it.

01:53:14.871 --> 01:53:15.996
Well, we'll know
better next time.

01:53:17.373 --> 01:53:18.665
'Til then.

01:53:34.766 --> 01:53:36.475
The sight is dismal.

01:53:38.269 --> 01:53:41.396
And our affairs from
England come too late.

01:53:41.815 --> 01:53:44.399
The ears are senseless that
should give us hearing.

01:53:44.776 --> 01:53:47.486
To tell him his
commandment is fulfilled.

01:53:48.112 --> 01:53:51.448
That Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are dead.
