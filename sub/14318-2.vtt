WEBVTT

00:02.458 --> 00:04.458
[TV announcer]
Another outbreak of violence...

00:04.458 --> 00:05.875
The perpetrator is believed
to be a mutant.

00:06.333 --> 00:07.875
[foster father]
She's one of them, Martha.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.500
[foster mother]
How could you register her

00:09.500 --> 00:12.125
with that Mutant Control Agency?

00:12.583 --> 00:14.458
[foster father]
Just hope the neighbors
never find out

00:14.458 --> 00:16.500
our beautiful Jubilee
is a mutant.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.208
[Sentinel]
Initiate capture.

00:18.208 --> 00:19.625
Release her!

00:20.750 --> 00:25.000
Storm...
Mistress of the Elements,
commands you.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.416
Gambit'll help you.

00:26.416 --> 00:27.833
Who are you?

00:27.833 --> 00:29.000
Cyclops.

00:30.458 --> 00:33.083
Jean, I knew the existence
of the X-Men

00:33.083 --> 00:35.500
would be revealed
to the public one day...

00:35.500 --> 00:37.166
but not like this.

00:37.708 --> 00:39.875
[Gambit]
There you are, Wolverine!

00:39.875 --> 00:42.125
[Jubilee]
What is this weird place?

00:42.125 --> 00:43.333
[laughing]

00:43.333 --> 00:46.000
Professor Xavier is our leader

00:46.000 --> 00:48.750
and he has named us
"The X-Men."

00:48.750 --> 00:50.333
Jubilee. She's gone.

00:50.333 --> 00:52.583
[Xavier]
That ID photograph is

00:52.583 --> 00:56.625
from the Mutant Control Agency
registration files.

00:56.625 --> 00:58.958
Storm will take three X-Men
in with her

00:58.958 --> 01:02.333
Wolverine and Beast and Morph.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.416
[Cyclops]
I just wish I knew
what was happening in there.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.250
[theme music playing]

02:21.125 --> 02:24.625
You look nervous
as a long-tailed cat in a room
full of rocking chairs.

02:25.166 --> 02:27.333
I just wish I knew
what was happening in there.

02:27.333 --> 02:29.708
If that was me in there,
you wouldn't have to worry.

02:31.083 --> 02:32.208
We got trouble.

02:40.458 --> 02:41.458
[exclaims]

02:45.000 --> 02:46.291
[guns cocking]

02:52.958 --> 02:54.416
[Wolverine]
Hold up!

02:54.416 --> 02:55.416
[sniffing]

02:55.875 --> 02:58.875
I smell gun oil.
Guards! They're on to us!

03:02.625 --> 03:07.291
And I used to wonder
how she acquired her
nom de guerre!

03:18.375 --> 03:20.000
Keep them away
from the building.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.125
Remember...
no humans are to be harmed.

03:23.125 --> 03:24.875
Watch yourselves as well.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.000
[Gambit]
How about you tell them
not to harm us?

03:33.416 --> 03:34.458
[morphed voice]
We're under attack!

03:34.958 --> 03:37.083
Report to the guard room
immediately!

03:44.750 --> 03:47.458
So long, suckers!
[Morph laughing]

03:47.458 --> 03:48.958
[guards clamoring]

03:48.958 --> 03:51.208
It looks like clear sailing
from here.

03:51.208 --> 03:55.000
We must destroy
every registration file
in this area.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.250
The computer is all yours,
Beast.

03:57.250 --> 03:58.458
My pleasure.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.500
No mutant name shall remain.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.958
[Storm]
We must destroy the hard files
as well.

04:04.416 --> 04:06.333
It's locked.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.416
Unlocked.

04:08.208 --> 04:11.125
As Archimedes said,
when he discovered

04:11.125 --> 04:13.208
the principle of displacement...

04:13.708 --> 04:14.708
"Eureka."

04:21.125 --> 04:23.166
[Gyrich]
Wake up! Wake up!

04:23.166 --> 04:26.583
I want to ask you
some questions, Jubilee.

04:26.583 --> 04:30.291
I want to know about
the mutants who helped you
at the mall.

04:30.291 --> 04:32.083
I don't know anything.

04:32.083 --> 04:33.875
Why are you doing this to me?

04:33.875 --> 04:36.875
I haven't done anything!
I'm just a kid.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.000
[Gyrich]
You've already made life
miserable

04:39.000 --> 04:40.833
for your foster parents.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.833
And as your mutant powers grow

04:43.833 --> 04:46.000
you'll become a danger
to everyone around you.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
It's not my fault!

04:48.000 --> 04:50.625
I can't help the way
I was born.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.708
You can help, Jubilee.

04:52.708 --> 04:55.875
You can help us identify
the most dangerous mutants
of all.

04:56.708 --> 05:01.333
[Gambit on tape]
Don't mess with the X-Men.
Don't mess with the X-Men.

05:01.333 --> 05:04.500
Who are these so-called X-Men?

05:04.500 --> 05:07.250
Gyrich! Why did you bring
that mutant here?

05:09.125 --> 05:13.458
-Who is she?
-Just a random name
from the files.

05:13.458 --> 05:18.000
A test to see how easy
it will be to capture the rest
of them.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
I thought we agreed
not to strike the mutants
until we had 100 Sentinels!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.458
Well, you're building them
too slowly, Trask.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.333
Aren't I paying you enough?

05:26.333 --> 05:28.250
What are you waiting for?
[cellphone ringing]

05:30.000 --> 05:31.083
Gyrich here.

05:32.458 --> 05:35.458
Eliminate those mutants
immediately!

05:36.375 --> 05:37.833
Trouble at the Agency.

05:41.083 --> 05:42.458
[exclaims]

05:43.333 --> 05:48.416
Come on, boys.
Let's all go for a little
moonlight swim.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.166
Don't get a moon-burn!

05:52.875 --> 05:54.166
You wanna play with Gambit?

05:54.833 --> 05:55.958
Here! Take a card!

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
House wins!

06:00.125 --> 06:03.166
Storm, we got trouble out here!
Move it
before someone gets hurt.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.625
Understood, Cyclops.

06:05.125 --> 06:07.458
Okay, we're done.
That's the last
of the mutant files.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.083
Let's go, Beast!

06:10.083 --> 06:13.875
"Though I am always in haste,
I am never in a hurry."

06:13.875 --> 06:15.291
John Wesley.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.958
In mere moments
the files shall be no more--

06:19.958 --> 06:23.708
My apologies, Beast.
We have no time for poetry.

06:24.375 --> 06:26.166
Storm to Cyclops.

06:26.166 --> 06:29.125
Mission accomplished.
We are coming out.

06:29.125 --> 06:32.291
Understood.
Everyone to the Blackbird .

06:32.291 --> 06:33.583
Gambit, blow that fence.

06:41.833 --> 06:43.458
Halt! Put your hands up!

06:51.000 --> 06:52.166
[screaming]

06:52.625 --> 06:53.750
[Rogue]
Come to mama.

06:53.750 --> 06:56.291
Put me down, you flying freak!

06:59.000 --> 07:00.625
[Rogue]
Whatever you say, sugar!

07:01.833 --> 07:05.833
First we charge the card,
then we blow it up!

07:09.375 --> 07:11.583
Life don't get much better
than this.

07:14.291 --> 07:16.166
After you, mon ami.

07:16.875 --> 07:19.708
Come on, move it!
We're missing dinner.

07:21.458 --> 07:24.708
Didn't I tell you?
Clear sailing all the way.

07:28.166 --> 07:29.875
[Wolverine]
Hey, Tin Woodsman!

07:30.875 --> 07:34.708
I'm sending you back to Oz
in pieces.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.000
Wolverine! Pull back!

07:38.416 --> 07:39.958
[screams]

07:40.875 --> 07:42.083
What's wrong, Jean?

07:42.083 --> 07:43.208
It's Morph.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.458
Can't you feel it?

07:52.208 --> 07:56.083
Morph? I don't sense anything.

08:00.833 --> 08:02.708
[Blackbird approaching]

08:19.458 --> 08:21.083
[sobbing]

08:29.208 --> 08:32.708
-[Wolverine] Cyclops!
-I know how you feel about it,
Wolverine, but--

08:32.708 --> 08:33.875
[grunts]

08:34.416 --> 08:36.250
You know nothing, little man!

08:37.000 --> 08:39.583
Next time, I use these!

08:39.583 --> 08:41.625
I've taken enough from you.

08:41.625 --> 08:45.083
Let's do it!
Let's see how tough you are

08:45.083 --> 08:46.625
when you ain't giving orders.

08:47.208 --> 08:49.208
Cyclops! Wolverine!

08:49.875 --> 08:53.625
-Stop it!
-Soldier boy here left them
behind.

08:53.625 --> 08:56.708
For all we know,
Morph and Beast may
still be alive.

08:57.416 --> 08:58.875
Beast is.

08:58.875 --> 09:00.458
What about Morph?

09:04.375 --> 09:05.583
[crying]

09:06.125 --> 09:07.708
He's gone, mon ami.

09:19.583 --> 09:23.750
[snarling]
Cowards, all of them!

09:24.291 --> 09:25.708
Wolverine!

09:29.500 --> 09:32.708
Tell Cyclops,
I made him a convertible.

09:32.708 --> 09:35.083
What happened isn't his fault.

09:36.708 --> 09:38.166
Wolverine!

09:38.833 --> 09:41.208
It's not your fault, either.

09:48.708 --> 09:50.500
[Wolverine]
Morph, Beast.

09:54.708 --> 09:56.416
Wolverine! Pull back!

09:59.000 --> 10:00.333
Morph?

10:01.125 --> 10:02.875
No!

10:05.000 --> 10:06.458
[screaming]

10:10.000 --> 10:12.333
-Beast!
-I'll get him!

10:12.333 --> 10:13.583
[grunts]

10:14.416 --> 10:17.583
It's adamantium-tasting time,
boys!

10:21.833 --> 10:23.000
[Wolverine screaming]

10:36.000 --> 10:39.166
Five-card stud.
Jacks or better to open.

10:41.875 --> 10:42.958
Come on, Rogue!

10:45.125 --> 10:47.000
Cyclops, give them an eyeful.

10:53.458 --> 10:57.750
Uh-oh! Let's fly!
Cyclops, move your butt!

11:09.708 --> 11:12.166
[Cyclops]
Wolverine, we've got to pull
back.

11:15.708 --> 11:18.583
Cyclops!
We are being overwhelmed.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.416
We must retreat.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.708
Come on, Wolverine! Let's go!

11:32.708 --> 11:36.833
Eat dirt, Cyclops.
X-Men don't cut and run.

11:36.833 --> 11:39.125
I'm going back
for Beast and Morph.

11:39.125 --> 11:40.875
We can't help them.

11:40.875 --> 11:44.291
Maybe you can't, junior,
but I can.

11:44.291 --> 11:46.333
I won't let you
throw your life away!

11:46.333 --> 11:47.416
Come back here!

11:48.708 --> 11:51.708
I go where I wanna go.

11:51.708 --> 11:54.875
Sorry. Not this time, sugar!

11:58.083 --> 12:01.458
Gotta be careful to pull out
enough of your energy

12:01.458 --> 12:03.750
to stop you
without hurting you.

12:07.708 --> 12:10.000
Morph. Beast.

12:11.708 --> 12:13.500
Don't leave them.

12:23.416 --> 12:27.875
I'll avenge you, my friend.
I swear it!

12:31.125 --> 12:34.375
[guard 1]
Send help! We have one of
the mutant intruders cornered.

12:34.375 --> 12:35.750
[guard 2]
Hold it right there!

12:35.750 --> 12:37.416
[Sentinel]
Stand aside, human.

12:37.416 --> 12:40.000
We will remove
the surviving mutant.

12:40.416 --> 12:43.875
You were sent here to help,
not take over.

12:43.875 --> 12:46.333
This is my prisoner, robot.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.708
Morph...

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
He's gone.

12:54.958 --> 12:56.833
I want to ask you
some questions.

12:56.833 --> 12:59.000
Another time.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
It's your funeral. I'll be back.

13:06.708 --> 13:09.291
And now, the President
of the United States.

13:09.291 --> 13:11.208
My fellow Americans...

13:12.000 --> 13:14.875
last night,
several renegade mutants

13:14.875 --> 13:18.708
attacked the headquarters
of the Federal Security Agency.

13:18.708 --> 13:21.416
This attack was foiled
with the help

13:21.416 --> 13:25.500
of experimental robot policemen
called Sentinels.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.708
Sentinels.

13:29.750 --> 13:34.166
And now a reply
to the President's speech
by Senator Robert Kelly.

13:34.166 --> 13:36.833
[Senator Kelly]
The incidents at
the New Salem Mall

13:37.458 --> 13:39.458
and the Mutant Control Agency...

13:39.458 --> 13:40.708
Why don't you
shut that garbage off?

13:41.250 --> 13:43.625
Why don't you get out of here,
fur-face?

13:43.625 --> 13:45.583
This here's our table.

13:45.583 --> 13:48.208
I'll bet. Yeah. Right.

13:51.708 --> 13:53.625
I don't think
you heard me, runt.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.000
Come on, big man.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.750
The fuzz ball's a mutant!

13:58.750 --> 14:01.875
Get out of my place.
We don't want your kind
around here!

14:01.875 --> 14:05.125
Yeah, why don't you go back
to the freak show?

14:05.125 --> 14:07.458
I go where I wanna go.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.208
Wolverine. Drop it.
I need to talk to you.

14:10.208 --> 14:12.333
[man]
Butt out, four eyes.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.375
You wouldn't hit a man
with glasses, would you?

14:15.375 --> 14:16.708
[man]
So take them off.

14:17.416 --> 14:18.416
Stop!

14:19.833 --> 14:21.958
Put them back on. Please.

14:23.583 --> 14:28.125
If you're here to apologize
for running out on Beast,
save your breath.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.583
I don't apologize
for command decisions.

14:35.333 --> 14:39.083
How would you like to locate
the Sentinels' home base?

14:39.708 --> 14:41.875
When and where?

14:46.166 --> 14:48.500
You wanted to see me,
Madam President?

14:48.500 --> 14:51.166
[President]
I wanted to congratulate you
and Dr. Trask.

14:51.166 --> 14:55.458
I also wanted to tell you
to stop all activities

14:55.458 --> 14:58.333
involving your privately-run
mutant registration program.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.125
Why?

15:00.125 --> 15:01.750
Those mutants were willing

15:01.750 --> 15:04.583
to sacrifice their lives
to destroy your files.

15:05.458 --> 15:08.333
Did they have good reason
to be threatened?

15:12.083 --> 15:14.958
The fool. They're all fools!

15:16.833 --> 15:18.125
[cellphone ringing]

15:20.083 --> 15:21.291
Gyrich here.

15:22.583 --> 15:24.000
Is he still there?

15:24.708 --> 15:27.333
[foster father]
I'll keep him here as long
as I can, Mr. Gyrich.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.708
-Soda?
-Thank you.

15:38.583 --> 15:41.583
He thinks Jubilee's been
kidnapped by those things

15:41.583 --> 15:44.875
the President talked about,
those giant Sentinels.

15:44.875 --> 15:48.291
What? But why would anyone
do something like that?

15:48.291 --> 15:51.166
Because people fear
what they don't understand.

15:52.458 --> 15:55.708
Look, you have to
get out of here now.

15:56.583 --> 16:00.500
They said we should call them
if anyone came asking
about Jubilee.

16:00.500 --> 16:04.125
You've done nothing wrong.
You just want to help her.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.291
And you have.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.500
Surrender, mutant.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.083
Of course.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.583
Not!

16:18.875 --> 16:19.875
[exclaims]

16:20.583 --> 16:24.083
Sentinel 14 damaged
by unknown mutant.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.250
Returning for repairs.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.083
[exclaims]

16:31.458 --> 16:33.458
I have the Sentinel on radar.

16:33.458 --> 16:35.083
[Cyclops]
Let's go get him.

16:35.083 --> 16:37.375
[Rogue]
This chicken's going home
to roost.

17:06.375 --> 17:09.166
-[Gyrich] Start packing, Trask.
-[Trask] What?

17:09.875 --> 17:14.166
The President has canceled
the government support
of mutant registration.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.250
The Sentinel program
may be next.

17:16.250 --> 17:18.416
We're moving the operation
overseas.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.708
[Sentinel approaching]

17:31.416 --> 17:32.708
[machine shutting down]

17:34.750 --> 17:36.125
All right!

17:37.583 --> 17:39.625
Can't those things watch
where they're going?

17:40.333 --> 17:43.708
Whatever happened,
I hope it keeps those
slime balls busy.

17:46.708 --> 17:48.875
Time to blow this joint.

17:50.458 --> 17:53.458
[Gyrich]
What... what's that?
Get out of my way! Look out!

17:58.250 --> 17:59.416
Stop her!

18:01.750 --> 18:03.500
Uh-oh! Wrong way!

18:06.500 --> 18:08.208
[Sentinel]
Halt, mutant.

18:08.208 --> 18:11.583
Oh, no. I just wanna go home!

18:12.083 --> 18:13.083
[Cyclops]
Jubilee! Duck!

18:27.000 --> 18:30.458
Come on, Trask!
Our work is just beginning.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.000
You miss me, petite?

18:42.708 --> 18:43.833
[Gambit chuckles]

18:44.583 --> 18:45.708
I reckon so.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
I summon the power
of thunder and lightning.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.458
You all ought to learn
how to behave.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.875
This one's for you, Morph!

19:57.583 --> 19:59.375
[Cyclops]
Is that all of them?

19:59.375 --> 20:00.708
Ain't that enough?

20:01.750 --> 20:04.416
[Jubilee]
You guys are the best
foster parents I ever had.

20:04.416 --> 20:06.333
But Professor's Xavier's
school is...

20:07.291 --> 20:09.458
It's the best place
for people like me.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.958
You will come to visit us,
won't you?

20:11.958 --> 20:13.875
Does a mall babe
eat chili fries?

20:24.250 --> 20:25.333
[Cyclops]
Jean.

20:27.291 --> 20:30.333
Back there with Beast and Morph

20:30.333 --> 20:31.708
do you think I did the right
thing?

20:31.708 --> 20:33.458
[Jean]
You did what you had to do.

20:34.583 --> 20:35.833
So did they.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.583
