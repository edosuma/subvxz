<i>Well, it's another
hot day in sunny California.</i>

00:26.680 --> 00:29.948
- <i>If you ask me, this is climate change in full effect.</i>
- <i>Oh, here we go.</i>

00:29.950 --> 00:32.383
- <i>It's never been this hot!</i>
- <i>It's the summer, man!</i>

00:32.384 --> 00:34.152
<i>It's the 4th of July!</i>

00:34.154 --> 00:36.454
<i>You deny that
the polar ice caps are melting.</i>

00:36.456 --> 00:38.990
<i>Okay, deny this, there's been
another mass shooting in the news.</i>

00:38.992 --> 00:40.992
<i>You know what,
let's just take a call.</i>

00:40.994 --> 00:43.594
<i>Caller number one, how are we
gonna stop these mass shootings</i>

00:43.596 --> 00:45.897
- <i>if we don't have gun sense?</i>
- <i>Hey, yeah, am I on?</i>

00:45.899 --> 00:48.132
- <i>Caller number one, you're on.</i>
- <i>Oh, I just wanna say,</i>

00:48.134 --> 00:51.001
<i>the problem ain't that you have
too many guns in California.</i>

00:51.003 --> 00:52.903
<i>It's that y'all
ain't got enough guns.</i>

00:52.905 --> 00:54.571
<i>Okay, sounds
like you've got an accent.</i>

00:54.573 --> 00:56.573
- <i>Where you from?</i>
- <i>We's passing through.</i>

00:56.575 --> 00:58.375
<i>That's all you need to know,
but I'm gonna tell you what.</i>

00:58.377 --> 01:00.345
<i>We got a saying back home,
"There's nothing stops</i>

01:00.347 --> 01:04.013
<i>a bad guy with a gun
like a good guy with a gun."</i>

01:04.016 --> 01:06.650
<i>See, the problem is
the good guys ain't armed.</i>

01:08.988 --> 01:10.620
<i>Here's the reality, folks.</i>

01:10.622 --> 01:12.789
<i>There's been mass shooting
after mass shooting.</i>

01:12.791 --> 01:14.590
<i>Sometimes,
people are present with guns.</i>

01:14.592 --> 01:17.693
<i>Guess what, they run away too,
they get shot too,</i>

01:17.695 --> 01:21.197
<i>because it's very, very difficult
in a chaotic situation</i>

01:21.199 --> 01:23.598
<i>even for a gun-owner
to do anything but run.</i>

01:23.600 --> 01:27.471
<i>The reality is that if we want
to stop mass shootings</i>

01:27.473 --> 01:29.239
<i>you don't arm everybody there;</i>

01:29.241 --> 01:31.941
<i>you take guns away
from crazy people</i>

01:31.943 --> 01:33.444
<i>who shouldn't have them
in the first place.</i>

01:34.112 --> 01:35.845
<i>Second amendment, apple pie,</i>

01:35.847 --> 01:37.982
<i>4th of July, that's America.</i>

01:38.483 --> 01:40.282
<i>A man was
stopped by the police today</i>

01:40.284 --> 01:42.117
<i>and was found to have a cache
of assault weapons</i>

01:42.119 --> 01:43.918
<i>in the trunk of his vehicle.</i>

01:43.920 --> 01:45.454
<i>Saying
that one in five Americans</i>

01:45.456 --> 01:47.422
<i>are now being prescribed
antidepressants.</i>

01:47.424 --> 01:50.226
<i>If we want
to have a healthy society,</i>

01:50.228 --> 01:52.861
<i>we have to be in harmony with
each other and with the planet.</i>

01:52.863 --> 01:54.499
<i>And the first thing
we have to do</i>

01:55.032 --> 01:57.032
<i>is to take some of these
weapons of war</i>

01:57.034 --> 01:58.800
<i>out of the hands
of ordinary people</i>

01:58.802 --> 02:01.102
<i>and give people the tools
to build a better society.</i>

02:01.104 --> 02:03.904
<i>We're not talking
about taking anyone's guns away.</i>

02:03.906 --> 02:06.640
- <i>We're just talking about making America safe again.</i>
- <i>USA! USA!</i>

02:06.642 --> 02:09.309
<i>Speaking of safe, what are
you doing for the 4th of July, darling?</i>

02:09.311 --> 02:11.178
<i>We're thinking of
going to the Santa Monica Pier</i>

02:11.180 --> 02:13.882
<i>to see the fireworks
or maybe up to Big Bear.</i>

02:13.884 --> 02:15.417
<i>That sounds good.</i>

02:15.419 --> 02:17.419
<i>Get out of the city
into the wilderness.</i>

02:17.421 --> 02:19.387
<i>Make sure you don't start no
wildfires with those fireworks.</i>

02:19.389 --> 02:20.954
<i>What are you, Smokey the Bear?</i>

02:20.956 --> 02:23.090
<i>Are we back on
climate change now?</i>

02:23.092 --> 02:25.259
- <i>What? What do you mean?</i>
- <i>Ice caps and stuff?</i>

02:25.261 --> 02:27.194
<i>Just making
sure the lady stays safe.</i>

02:27.196 --> 02:28.996
<i>The 4th
of July, as I like to say,</i>

02:28.998 --> 02:30.464
<i>it's always been one
of my favorite holidays.</i>

02:30.466 --> 02:33.866
<i>We urge you not to do
any fireworks at home.</i>

02:33.868 --> 02:36.937
<i>...when we see
these mass shootings keep happening.</i>

02:36.939 --> 02:39.339
<i>Would we be safer
if our teachers were armed?</i>

02:39.341 --> 02:41.641
<i>Hell no,
our schools would be a war zone!</i>

02:41.643 --> 02:46.112
<i>The US gun death
rate is higher than the one...</i>

02:46.114 --> 02:48.114
<i>Guns, desserts, and fireworks.</i>

02:48.116 --> 02:49.882
<i>So, go ahead
and be safe out there.</i>

02:49.884 --> 02:51.618
<i>Happy birthday, America!</i>

03:17.044 --> 03:17.945
Mm.

03:18.644 --> 03:22.615
Who the hell are you?

03:26.086 --> 03:28.021
I wanna know who you are.

03:28.856 --> 03:31.291
I wanna know who
you fucking work for.

03:32.059 --> 03:33.025
Huh?

03:34.827 --> 03:36.629
We gon' find out.

03:48.207 --> 03:51.942
Come on, y'all, first
fade of the day is free 99.

03:51.944 --> 03:53.743
- Hell nah.
- Hell no.

03:53.745 --> 03:55.812
Come on, no?

04:00.051 --> 04:01.784
See you and that
old fool behind me,

04:01.786 --> 04:03.153
y'all got the same type of hair.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.787
You got that Michael Jackson
head curl,

04:04.789 --> 04:07.290
and you got that Idris Elba,
you know what I'm saying?

04:07.292 --> 04:09.292
- Come on, man.
- Damn, your wife is ugly.

04:09.294 --> 04:11.261
Yeah, well, everybody
knows that 90 percent

04:11.263 --> 04:13.930
of pretty women just lay there,
want you to do all the work,

04:13.932 --> 04:15.633
but an ugly woman,
she knows how to work it.

04:15.635 --> 04:17.800
She can get milk out of a crowbar.
Ain't that right, Chief?

04:17.802 --> 04:21.070
- That's some sexist shit.
- But real is real child, I can't deny it.

04:21.072 --> 04:25.007
I wouldn't know, 'cause my wife is a
fine ass freakologist that will drop

04:25.009 --> 04:27.242
- some Kama Sutra on your ass.
- Yeah, right.

04:27.244 --> 04:29.111
You telling me
if badass Rihanna

04:29.113 --> 04:31.882
came in here butt-booty-ass
naked covered in hot butter,

04:32.483 --> 04:34.982
- you ain't gonna do nothing?
- Yeah, I'd do something.

04:34.984 --> 04:36.952
I'd ask the queen
to grace my throne

04:36.954 --> 04:38.856
and then I would give her
a badass line.

04:39.857 --> 04:43.194
If Rihanna should enter here, I
will eat her like fried chicken.

04:43.894 --> 04:45.527
- What?
- You know, I don't see

04:45.529 --> 04:48.029
what is wrong with loving
and respecting your wife.

04:48.031 --> 04:49.598
- Preach!
- Amen.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.800
I've been loving and respecting
my wife for 18 years.

04:52.802 --> 04:54.635
Even my girlfriend knows that.

04:58.074 --> 05:00.442
Hey, Chief, turn the TV up.

05:00.444 --> 05:02.444
That's happening
right around here.

05:02.446 --> 05:04.278
<i>Breaking
exclusive on a missing person.</i>

05:04.280 --> 05:06.647
<i>High school senior
Stacey Bastion has gone missing.</i>

05:06.649 --> 05:09.584
She was last seen with her
friends at the Fox Hills mall

05:09.586 --> 05:11.254
wearing her school uniform.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.489
<i>...and her parents
are offering a 50,000-dollar reward</i>

05:15.491 --> 05:18.291
<i>for any information
as to her whereabouts.</i>

05:18.293 --> 05:20.894
<i>In other news, there's been
another mass shooting today.</i>

05:20.896 --> 05:24.064
<i>This sort of thing just seems to be
happening with more and more frequency.</i>

05:24.066 --> 05:28.768
<i>Three hundred thousand
Americans have died in a ten-year period.</i>

05:28.770 --> 05:32.239
<i>If Al Qaeda came over here
and killed as many people</i>

05:32.241 --> 05:35.008
<i>as are killed in one day
by US gun violence,</i>

05:35.010 --> 05:37.109
<i>it would be considered
a national emergency.</i>

05:37.111 --> 05:39.646
See, old white men
who run the NRA

05:39.648 --> 05:42.348
don't even care
when their own kids get shot.

05:42.350 --> 05:44.416
Fool, didn't you pay attention
in school?

05:44.418 --> 05:46.285
Don't you know the first thing
the federal government did

05:46.287 --> 05:48.154
under President Abraham Lincoln?

05:48.156 --> 05:51.391
They whooped the South's ass and
then freed all the black folks.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.259
- That's right.
- Then of course, later,

05:53.261 --> 05:55.394
you got some black folks in the
White House as the first family

05:55.396 --> 05:57.596
and all these crackers
lost their mind,

05:57.598 --> 06:00.099
acting a fool, talking about,
"Take back America,

06:00.101 --> 06:01.766
we want our country back."

06:01.768 --> 06:03.535
Reality is they still trying
to overthrow the government

06:03.537 --> 06:05.903
and that's why they don't want
nobody to know

06:05.905 --> 06:07.772
how many guns they got
and who got 'em.

06:07.774 --> 06:09.674
- Amen!
- That's why they support Donald Trump.

06:09.676 --> 06:12.678
'Cause they figure, "Here's
a cracker just as dumb as me!"

06:12.680 --> 06:14.280
- Stupid!
- No, what's stupid

06:14.282 --> 06:18.249
is young black men with tattoos
all over they face

06:18.251 --> 06:20.084
and they neck
shooting each other.

06:20.086 --> 06:22.887
- Back up on my nephew.
- No, no, no.

06:22.889 --> 06:24.389
I got something for him.

06:24.391 --> 06:26.524
I'm gonna tell you what's
stupid, is old folk

06:26.526 --> 06:28.892
losing their women
to young brothers like me.

06:53.918 --> 06:56.220
Where's Santos?

06:56.921 --> 06:59.355
Uh, yeah, Santos, he...

06:59.357 --> 07:01.926
he phone in, he's sick,
he says he's sorry.

07:02.528 --> 07:04.960
I need my hair cut today,
Santos cuts my hair.

07:04.962 --> 07:07.131
I know, I know, he apologized.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.400
Uh, hey, young brother.

07:11.803 --> 07:13.738
I'm filling in for Santos, man.

07:14.405 --> 07:16.441
Maybe this is manifest destiny.

07:17.408 --> 07:19.510
You tried the rest,
get with the best.

07:20.578 --> 07:22.879
Young brother,
you know The Rock?

07:23.547 --> 07:25.715
His hair texture
is just like yours, man.

07:25.717 --> 07:27.982
Now I know he's follically
challenged right now,

07:27.984 --> 07:31.456
but back in the day, I cut his double's
hair twice, and baby, no problemo.

07:32.289 --> 07:33.423
Huh?

07:34.091 --> 07:37.394
Chief, this guy is... his brother's
Mexican mafia. You don't want this.

07:41.798 --> 07:45.734
You know what, I'm afraid,
we're all afraid.

07:45.736 --> 07:46.936
I get it.

07:48.138 --> 07:51.439
But see, I'm scared
for the young girl

07:51.441 --> 07:54.043
that you're taking
to the <i>quinceañera,</i> right?

07:54.778 --> 07:57.344
That's why you're dressed up so pretty,
you're going to the <i>quinceañera?</i>

07:57.346 --> 08:00.748
See, aha. I got ya, right?

08:00.750 --> 08:03.150
I'm worried,
because she won't be able

08:03.152 --> 08:05.017
to keep all the chiquititas'
hands off you

08:05.019 --> 08:07.222
once I do what I do to your 'do.

08:07.823 --> 08:09.823
I know, you look a little
like Bruno Mars now,

08:09.825 --> 08:14.428
but, baby, I'ma bring it to you.
Come on, come on down.

08:14.430 --> 08:17.767
Look here, in the past,
Santos cut your hair.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.335
And in the future, who knows?

08:21.002 --> 08:25.238
But right now,
this moment is the gift

08:25.240 --> 08:27.008
and that's why they call it
the present.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.944
Do you... have the willpower,

08:31.579 --> 08:34.614
the strength, the foresight
to recognize

08:34.616 --> 08:37.217
that the universe
is bringing you a present?

08:38.486 --> 08:41.089
And everything
happens for a reason.

08:50.631 --> 08:54.268
Hey, your brother wanted this
done now and I ain't coming back.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.005
Are you serious?

09:08.649 --> 09:11.117
Yeah, don't even trip,
don't trip on them.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.653
I got you.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.225
I'm not going to a <i>quinceañera.</i>

09:20.526 --> 09:22.127
I'm going to
my father's funeral.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.466
Fuck up, yours will be next.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.877
Uh, Hector, I got to go,
I got a hot date.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.613
- You got two more appointments.
- I got to go.

09:42.113 --> 09:45.113
- I'm just gonna shave at home.
- I got a cake in the oven.

09:46.952 --> 09:49.087
- What about...
- Hector, I'll see you later.

10:01.031 --> 10:02.866
"If you can keep
your head when all about you

10:02.868 --> 10:04.903

10:05.603 --> 10:08.035
trust yourself,
when all men doubt you,

10:08.037 --> 10:09.438
but make allowances for their..."

10:09.440 --> 10:11.207
You doing some
kinda voodoo shit?

10:12.076 --> 10:13.812
No, no, brother, that's Kipling.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.411
Poetry, I recite
a little Kipling

10:16.413 --> 10:17.815
every now and then
to keep me focused.

10:18.883 --> 10:20.582
Keep my head right,
give me that extra.

10:20.584 --> 10:23.119
I don't wanna hear
no weird shit, just line me up.

11:36.891 --> 11:38.091
What, now you're hungry?

11:38.993 --> 11:41.394
No, no, no, no, man, it's, um...

11:42.897 --> 11:46.733
it's time for some...
some old school perfection.

12:47.925 --> 12:50.662
I got you, I got you,
I got you, I got you.

12:53.031 --> 12:54.464
What happened? Hey!

13:04.742 --> 13:07.812
It was an accident, he's new here!

13:08.378 --> 13:09.779
You, you are fired, get out!

15:01.721 --> 15:03.656
Oh, I'm so sorry, are you okay?

15:04.258 --> 15:05.489
Are you nuts?

15:05.491 --> 15:08.826
- Do I look okay?
- Oh, shit.

15:08.828 --> 15:11.264
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, shit.

15:11.764 --> 15:15.331
- Please, not today.
- Your camera all right?

15:15.333 --> 15:16.966
It's not even mine.

15:16.968 --> 15:17.969
The bike...

15:19.171 --> 15:20.539
the bike is mine.

15:21.039 --> 15:22.073
Oh, shit.

15:22.641 --> 15:24.509
Why does this
keep happening to me?

15:25.244 --> 15:26.344
I try...

15:27.180 --> 15:28.478
I try to stay positive.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.147
That's good,
my therapist would say,

15:30.149 --> 15:32.015
"We're like walking magnets,
and if you keep your magnet

15:32.017 --> 15:34.318
tuned to the positive, you know,
you're gonna draw in positive."

15:34.853 --> 15:36.986
Except I drew in a Looney Tune
who runs out of nowhere

15:36.988 --> 15:38.754
- and knocks me on my ass.
- No, no, no.

15:38.756 --> 15:41.723
Listen, I'm having an
extraordinarily bad day too,

15:41.725 --> 15:43.592
but I keep in mind,
they say everything,

15:43.594 --> 15:45.027
every little thing happens for...

15:45.029 --> 15:46.829
If you say everything
happens for a reason

15:46.831 --> 15:48.798
and life doesn't give you
anything you can't handle,

15:48.800 --> 15:51.067
- I'll fucking scream.
- Okay, listen.

15:51.069 --> 15:52.835
I'ma give you some...
a little money

15:52.837 --> 15:54.672
for your bike, your damages.

15:55.472 --> 15:57.508
Where's my wallet,
where's my wallet?

16:01.245 --> 16:02.911
You can't even find your wallet.

16:02.913 --> 16:04.345
- No, no, I got it.
- Classic.

16:04.347 --> 16:06.050
Just forget about it, okay?

16:06.983 --> 16:08.649
No, no, I'll get it,
I'll get it,

16:08.651 --> 16:09.986
I'll find it, I'll find it.

16:37.379 --> 16:39.048
They're gonna be deaf
by the time...

17:15.383 --> 17:16.616
They're after you too.

17:18.252 --> 17:19.452
What?

17:23.190 --> 17:24.757
Jonesie?

17:24.759 --> 17:26.093
That's right.

17:27.527 --> 17:29.228
They ain't got me yet, Chief.

17:29.230 --> 17:30.430
Yeah, but they're trying.

17:34.601 --> 17:37.769
- Oh, man, what's it been, ten years?
- You crazy fucker.

17:37.771 --> 17:39.569
- You look like shit, Chief.
- I know, man.

17:39.571 --> 17:40.874
You look exactly the same.

17:41.607 --> 17:44.244
- How'd you get in here?
- You know me, you have to ask?

17:45.412 --> 17:47.812
Bodyguard business has been
booming for you, huh?

17:47.814 --> 17:51.082
No, no, no, no, man, no, no, no.

17:51.084 --> 17:53.851
Listen, I lost my security
business years ago.

17:53.853 --> 17:55.552
I'm just staying
at my brother's crib

17:55.554 --> 17:58.256
till I get back on my A game.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen.

17:58.258 --> 18:00.557
He's a particular son of a
bitch, so you gotta be careful

18:00.559 --> 18:02.194
with all of his
little pretty toys.

18:02.695 --> 18:03.961
What you listening to, man?

18:05.864 --> 18:08.434
Oh, you playin' the Pachelbel,
I like it.

18:09.234 --> 18:11.535
You said every hero
needs theme music.

18:11.537 --> 18:12.905
It's their job for a life.

18:16.976 --> 18:18.710
Especially around
the 4th of July.

18:20.279 --> 18:21.846
Hey, Jonesie,
you all right, man?

18:22.448 --> 18:23.614
Why are you here, dude?

18:25.283 --> 18:26.751
You needed me, so here I am.

18:28.419 --> 18:30.455
Okay, let's try it another way.

18:31.022 --> 18:34.856
How about, Jonesie,
who's chasing you?

18:34.858 --> 18:36.627
And what the fuck's going on?

18:37.762 --> 18:41.531
Exactly,
that's the question, "Who?"

18:42.066 --> 18:44.100
It's the agency,
who's behind the curtain

18:44.102 --> 18:45.702
and why are they doing
this to us?

18:48.505 --> 18:49.673
Come on.

18:51.041 --> 18:53.041
Come on, I saw your meds.

18:53.043 --> 18:55.812
The same ones they prescribed
to me, for all of us.

18:57.613 --> 18:58.848
- Jonesie.
- I saw your meds.

18:59.417 --> 19:00.682
You break into my brother's home

19:00.684 --> 19:02.185
and now you're going through
my shit?

19:04.921 --> 19:08.724
You really have no idea
how FUBAR this is, do you?

19:09.825 --> 19:11.627
At first, it's the insomnia.

19:14.163 --> 19:15.798
Then the panic attack starts.

19:17.466 --> 19:18.901
Those fuckers suck.

19:20.668 --> 19:22.269
Then the nightmares
turn into day-mares.

19:22.271 --> 19:23.939
You remember Private Davis,
right?

19:25.074 --> 19:27.477
The religious kid,
thought we were going to hell.

19:27.977 --> 19:30.911
That poor son of a bitch
jumped 16 flights to his death.

19:30.913 --> 19:32.279
He left a note saying,

19:32.281 --> 19:34.181
"The demons are coming
for all of us."

19:34.183 --> 19:35.948
Patchinsky's on a no-fly list,
he thinks he's a terrorist.

19:35.950 --> 19:37.451
Riddick is in a padded cell.

19:37.453 --> 19:39.819
It's like almost whatever
you fear most, you...

19:39.821 --> 19:41.089
You manifest.

19:43.258 --> 19:44.325
You manifest.

19:47.263 --> 19:48.330
Manifest.

19:53.301 --> 19:57.370
When my parents passed away,
I had to go stay with my uncle.

19:57.372 --> 19:58.572
He lived in the hood.

19:59.374 --> 20:01.040
It was always dark and damp,

20:01.042 --> 20:03.075
and there was roaches
everywhere, man.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.778
You had to sleep
with the lights on.

20:06.113 --> 20:08.013
Anyway, one night I guess
the bulb burnt out,

20:08.015 --> 20:10.950
because, baby, I woke up,
there were roaches everywhere.

20:10.952 --> 20:14.655
Like on my bed, in my clothes,
in my fucking hair.

20:16.056 --> 20:17.689
Then I started getting
these earaches

20:17.691 --> 20:19.224
and I'm losing my balance,
and my uncle's saying to me,

20:19.226 --> 20:21.927
"Nah, nah, no,
it's psychosomatic.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.763
You know, just toughen up."

20:24.964 --> 20:26.999
Finally, he gets me
to a doctor and then...

20:28.835 --> 20:30.136
turns out one of the roaches

20:30.770 --> 20:33.139
had crawled in my right ear
and laid eggs.

20:35.142 --> 20:36.944
I could've lost hearing
in my right ear.

20:39.246 --> 20:41.045
And now I'm seeing
roaches again.

20:41.047 --> 20:44.982
<i>And I tell myself they're not
real, I know it's in my head.</i>

20:44.984 --> 20:46.716
Something happened
to us in that raid, Chief.

20:46.718 --> 20:48.818
<i>The feds never told us
what was going on</i>

20:48.820 --> 20:50.588
<i>in that lab, did they?</i>

20:50.590 --> 20:51.923
Was it nerve gas?

20:53.392 --> 20:54.793
Sarin gas?

20:59.132 --> 21:01.599
<i>Police, open up.
Open up, this is LAPD.</i>

21:01.601 --> 21:03.666
- Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
- Cops know I'm here.

21:03.668 --> 21:05.835
- Jonesie, put that away, relax.
- What are the cops doing here?

21:05.837 --> 21:07.706
- Jonesie, listen.
- Stow the weapon.

21:08.373 --> 21:10.140
- Yeah, you got it.
- <i>This is the police,</i>

21:10.142 --> 21:11.276
<i>we need to speak with you.</i>

21:12.676 --> 21:15.178
<i>Good evening, sir,
have you seen this girl?</i>

21:15.180 --> 21:17.179
<i>Here's a flyer
of what she looks like.</i>

21:17.181 --> 21:19.148
- <i>Her name is Stacey Bastion.</i>
- <i>No, officer, I haven't.</i>

21:19.150 --> 21:21.483
<i>Call us if
you do, thank you for your time.</i>

21:21.485 --> 21:22.419
Chief.

21:24.489 --> 21:25.624
Yeah, it's nothing, man.

21:26.124 --> 21:27.723
It's about that missing girl.

21:27.725 --> 21:29.693
They think she might still be
in the neighborhood.

21:32.229 --> 21:34.899
Here? With all the rich folks?

21:42.772 --> 21:44.774
Got us a bogey, six o'clock.

21:47.211 --> 21:49.111
Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

21:49.113 --> 21:51.946
That's Max, my brother rents
the guesthouse to him.

21:51.948 --> 21:54.048
He's just a musician,
he keeps to himself.

21:54.050 --> 21:56.217
- I don't trust him.
- You don't trust anybody.

21:56.219 --> 21:58.486
- Come away from the window.
- Hold on, no, I trust you.

21:58.488 --> 22:00.857
- This is not a good time.
- We need you.

22:01.757 --> 22:05.159
- They gave me a week.
- Who? Who's we?

22:05.161 --> 22:07.562
The team, the squad,
there's only five of us left

22:07.564 --> 22:09.497
but they're talking about doing
something, I'm scared, sir.

22:09.499 --> 22:12.099
Merc is filling up their heads
with this vengeance talk.

22:12.101 --> 22:14.135
- Merc?
- People could get hurt, yes, Merc.

22:14.137 --> 22:16.239
- Like crazy demolition Merc?
- Yeah.

22:17.706 --> 22:18.807
Yes.

22:21.343 --> 22:23.212
You tell everybody
to stand down.

22:24.313 --> 22:27.813
Nobody, nobody does anything
without my orders.

22:27.815 --> 22:29.149
All right?

22:29.151 --> 22:31.085
Especially that wack job Merc.

22:32.354 --> 22:33.254
Yes, sir.

22:34.690 --> 22:37.092
I know a guy with
some contacts on the inside.

22:37.893 --> 22:39.259
Okay?

22:39.261 --> 22:41.094
- We wait for your orders.
- Okay.

22:41.096 --> 22:43.130
- Yes, sir.
- All right, come on.

22:44.832 --> 22:46.300
One more thing.

22:47.301 --> 22:51.038
Can I, uh...
can I rack with you?

22:51.572 --> 22:53.807
Just for a couple days.

22:54.774 --> 22:55.676
You mean stay here?

22:56.711 --> 22:59.046
- Jonesie.
- No, I promise I won't touch anything, I...

23:00.448 --> 23:03.115
Jonesie, I'm not... this is
my brother's place, okay?

23:03.117 --> 23:04.452
- Okay?
- Please, please.

23:05.553 --> 23:06.454
Please.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.588
I won't touch a thing.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.031
Can't be alone right now, sir.

23:23.003 --> 23:26.139
All right, okay, okay,
all right.

23:26.773 --> 23:29.276
You stay in my
niece's room, okay?

23:30.710 --> 23:31.975
I'll get you a towel.

23:31.977 --> 23:34.279
Please don't...
don't touch anything.

23:34.281 --> 23:36.148
- Please.
- I won't touch, I swear.

24:41.678 --> 24:44.845
Jessica, let's go,
we're gonna miss this flight.

24:44.847 --> 24:45.782
Almost done.

24:46.750 --> 24:49.049
Big bro, do me a favor
and hang this up for me?

24:49.051 --> 24:51.018
- I got you.
- Carefully.

24:51.020 --> 24:52.553
That's some expensive shit.

24:52.555 --> 24:54.555
- Jessica!
- Yeah, I got it.

24:54.557 --> 24:56.891
Don't wear my shit,
we ain't kids no more.

24:58.561 --> 25:01.962
- Dad, I'm ready.
- Hey, Jess, Jess, check this out.

25:01.964 --> 25:03.964
I got my music
linked to my pulse.

25:03.966 --> 25:05.700
Whatever I feel, it plays.

25:05.702 --> 25:07.935
All new jams,
I'm gonna do this app.

25:07.937 --> 25:09.503
I'ma call it "Mood Music
From the Soul."

25:09.505 --> 25:12.905
Yeah, only I control
what goes into my ear holes,

25:12.907 --> 25:15.274
and who goes into my room,
right?

25:15.276 --> 25:17.477
Jessica, go outside
and make sure the driver knows

25:17.479 --> 25:18.848
what terminal we're going to,
all right?

25:19.481 --> 25:21.915
All right. Grab the bags,
big bro.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.585
You remember what Pops
used to tell us, right?

25:24.587 --> 25:26.420
- Three kinds of people in this world.
- Uh-huh.

25:26.422 --> 25:28.221
Those who watch things happen.

25:28.223 --> 25:30.490
Those who complain
about things that happen.

25:30.492 --> 25:31.893
And those
who make things happen.

25:32.427 --> 25:33.892
How you think
I was able to afford

25:33.894 --> 25:35.328
this big, beautiful house?

25:35.330 --> 25:36.863
- Paid for.
- Yeah.

25:36.865 --> 25:39.131
You the kinda brother
that makes things happen.

25:39.133 --> 25:40.932
There it is, exactly.

25:45.305 --> 25:47.240
How do you think
I was able to afford this

25:47.242 --> 25:50.877
candy-coated mid-life-crisis
old-school paid for?

25:50.879 --> 25:53.713
- 'Cause you the kinda brother that makes things happen.
- You damn right.

25:53.715 --> 25:55.447
All while putting my daughter
through law school

25:55.449 --> 25:57.351
and having a fat-ass 401k.

25:58.085 --> 25:59.219
- I'll take that.
- Thank you, man.

25:59.753 --> 26:01.622
Now, come here,
let me talk to you, all right?

26:02.188 --> 26:03.724
Come here, listen.

26:04.357 --> 26:06.392
You got a birthday
coming up soon, okay?

26:06.894 --> 26:09.160
No more excuses,
no more bullshit.

26:09.162 --> 26:10.996
It's never too late
to get your life together.

26:10.998 --> 26:12.264
You understand me?

26:12.266 --> 26:15.734
Four rules,
don't touch, don't wear,

26:15.736 --> 26:17.504
and don't drive any of my shit,

26:18.371 --> 26:20.237
and no visitors at the house,
you got me?

26:20.239 --> 26:21.607
This means a lot to me.

26:22.175 --> 26:23.409
It better.

26:23.975 --> 26:26.245
Come here, bro.
Love you, brother.

26:27.580 --> 26:29.345
I do want you to touch
some soap and water.

26:29.347 --> 26:30.683
Now take a shower
'cause you stink.

26:32.951 --> 26:35.087
And make sure you're gone
by the time we get back.

26:37.223 --> 26:38.324
Bye, Jess.

26:46.465 --> 26:48.200
If you can meet with triumph...

26:49.501 --> 26:50.535
and disaster...

26:51.636 --> 26:53.738
and treat those two imposters
just the same...

27:45.153 --> 27:48.289
Hey, hey, you need a lift?

27:48.291 --> 27:49.924
Are you freaking following me?

27:49.926 --> 27:52.527
What, no, no, it's me,
I'm the guy from the other day.

27:52.529 --> 27:53.897
I'm the one that
killed your bike.

27:54.430 --> 27:57.032
Listen, I am really,
really sorry about that.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.701
Where are you headed?

27:59.401 --> 28:00.636
Uh, Venice Beach.

28:02.671 --> 28:04.606
If you hop in now
I can give you a ride.

28:13.282 --> 28:16.082
So, Mr. Can't Find
His Wallet's a baller.

28:16.084 --> 28:17.118
I found it.

28:17.753 --> 28:20.221
All this material eye candy
belongs to my brother.

28:21.088 --> 28:22.454
It's a long story.

28:22.456 --> 28:24.592
Chief Jason Pratt,
Securities Offices.

28:25.793 --> 28:26.928
So you're a secure guy?

28:27.595 --> 28:30.563
- It's an old card.
- All flash and still no cash

28:30.565 --> 28:32.230
to reimburse me for my bike.

28:32.232 --> 28:33.333
Can I use your backseat?

28:35.102 --> 28:36.635
Uh, yeah.

28:36.637 --> 28:38.372
You know, I'm gonna reimburse
you for your bike.

28:39.707 --> 28:40.708
That's for sure.

28:42.510 --> 28:45.278
So... did you lose your job?

28:46.013 --> 28:48.179
My job. You... you know what,

28:48.181 --> 28:50.250
nothing that is truly ours
can be lost.

28:51.318 --> 28:52.552
That job lost me.

28:53.853 --> 28:55.486
We're not defined by
our bank accounts

28:55.488 --> 28:57.254
or what people think of us.

28:57.256 --> 28:59.359
Onwards and upwards,
that's what I say.

29:01.963 --> 29:04.162
I thought you were some kind
of model or something.

29:04.164 --> 29:05.630
What's with the business get-up?

29:05.632 --> 29:07.932
I do erotic performance
art micro films

29:07.934 --> 29:11.736
- and I post 'em on my channel.
- So, you have, like, followers?

29:11.738 --> 29:15.341
No, I'm transitioning into
couple's intimacy counseling.

29:16.208 --> 29:17.910
I conducted my first
interview today.

29:18.777 --> 29:22.180
So, you're like a...
a sex therapist?

29:23.049 --> 29:26.116
I teach body awareness
through tantric yoga.

29:26.118 --> 29:28.418
So many couples
avoid true intimacy,

29:28.420 --> 29:29.953
and without intimacy
you can't have

29:29.955 --> 29:31.655
a deep emotional connection.

29:31.657 --> 29:33.590
You know what,
my wife would love that.

29:33.592 --> 29:36.593
She's always trying to get me
into counseling.

29:36.595 --> 29:38.929
She says sometimes
it just felt like sex to her.

29:38.931 --> 29:41.599
A true orgasm can be
a spiritual experience.

29:43.267 --> 29:45.668
- You're messing with me, right?
- Seriously!

29:45.670 --> 29:47.873
Couples that learn together,
last together.

29:55.346 --> 29:58.146
This Friday we're holding a
One Love community youth fair.

29:58.148 --> 29:59.682
You should bring your wife.

29:59.684 --> 30:03.052
There'll be face painting,
art classes, capoeira.

30:03.054 --> 30:04.956
Just bring whatever skill set
it is you have.

30:05.622 --> 30:08.923
Yeah, well, I'm gonna be pretty
busy for a little while, so.

30:08.925 --> 30:10.862
Oh, okay, Mr. Busy.

30:11.429 --> 30:12.928
Besides posing as your brother,

30:12.930 --> 30:14.562
what's your contribution
to the world?

30:16.667 --> 30:18.134
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- Moments away.

30:18.136 --> 30:20.602
- <i>What should I wear?</i>
- Oh, you're kidding me.

30:20.604 --> 30:22.937
- <i>No, I'm not!</i>
- Okay, go with primary colors

30:22.939 --> 30:25.974
and the boxer look,
take deep yogi breaths.

30:25.976 --> 30:28.444
- Everything will be fine.
- <i>Okay, but hurry!</i>

30:31.280 --> 30:32.782
Are you an ass or a tit man?

30:34.215 --> 30:35.852
- What?
- Boobs or booty?

30:38.155 --> 30:39.120
Uh, booty.

30:43.626 --> 30:45.361
That's great,
you're doing amazing.

30:46.262 --> 30:48.162
<i>♪ Shake that
Thing like it's a sport ♪</i>

30:48.164 --> 30:50.132
<i>♪ I love it when you wear
The booty shorts ♪</i>

30:50.700 --> 30:52.331
<i>♪ You best stop
Acting bougie ♪</i>

30:52.333 --> 30:54.569
<i>♪ And let me see you bounce
That booty ♪</i>

31:09.250 --> 31:10.985
Everybody, let's go!

31:22.198 --> 31:24.163
<i>Don't bother
leaving a message, fuckhead.</i>

31:24.165 --> 31:26.300
<i>You're crazier than me.</i>

31:27.168 --> 31:28.600
Jonesie, where are you, man?

31:28.602 --> 31:30.370
I'm in Werdin alleyway,
we're late.

31:34.341 --> 31:37.544
Slow motion,
and hand over your cell.

31:38.679 --> 31:41.380
Ah, don't eyeball me,
motherfucker.

31:42.348 --> 31:44.348
Hm, hm.

31:44.350 --> 31:46.653
You sure do look pretty.

31:51.191 --> 31:52.659
I'm sorry, Chief.

31:53.861 --> 31:55.328
Bitching out.

31:56.429 --> 31:58.029
We're in the belly of the beast.

31:58.031 --> 32:00.331
All those eyes in the sky,
you gotta stay sharp, sir.

32:00.333 --> 32:02.233
- You're late. Yes, sir.
- I got detained.

32:02.235 --> 32:04.103
- Put your piece away.
- This?

32:04.670 --> 32:07.270
This ain't mine, it's yours.

32:07.272 --> 32:09.272
All right, take it, take it,
it's your birthday.

32:09.274 --> 32:11.742
It's a SIG P226, the Navy SEALs
actually use those.

32:11.744 --> 32:13.144
Holds about 20 in the mag.

32:13.146 --> 32:14.411
Got it off some gun dealers.

32:14.413 --> 32:15.615
Second Amendment, baby,
am I right?

32:16.348 --> 32:19.282
No waiting, no background checks
even for crazy fuckers like us.

32:19.284 --> 32:20.683
I told you to wear a suit, man.

32:20.685 --> 32:22.320
We gotta be taken
seriously here.

32:22.921 --> 32:24.454
What are you doing
with my phone?

32:24.456 --> 32:25.657
Magnetic box.

32:35.901 --> 32:36.802
One second.

32:41.606 --> 32:43.639
All right,
as far as GPS is concerned,

32:43.641 --> 32:45.208
you're heading on that bus.

32:45.210 --> 32:47.143
Give us about 20 minutes here
and another ten minutes

32:47.145 --> 32:48.510
to beat the bus to Crenshaw.

32:48.512 --> 32:50.078
Retrieve your cell phone,
we're good.

32:50.080 --> 32:53.248
It's time. Now, brother,
you gotta dial the crazy back.

32:53.250 --> 32:55.784
You listen to me,
you gotta dial down the crazy.

32:55.786 --> 32:57.953
This is a good guy,
he's trying to help us.

32:57.955 --> 32:59.690
I think you should go
on your own.

33:00.691 --> 33:02.126
Brother, we're in this together.

33:03.060 --> 33:05.596
Please, don't speak
that governmentese no more, man.

33:06.730 --> 33:08.263
Metal and security streaming
at the chrome dome.

33:08.265 --> 33:10.698
- What the fuck is that, man?
- Chrome dome, man.

33:10.700 --> 33:12.067
Tape and tin foil, all right?

33:12.069 --> 33:13.734
It takes away the
low frequency microwaves

33:13.736 --> 33:15.436
and it keeps them
from getting in your head.

33:15.438 --> 33:17.674
Jonesie, please, you look like
the tin man, like, on crack.

33:25.481 --> 33:28.850
Holy shit, holy shit.

33:28.852 --> 33:30.119
Holy shit.

33:32.088 --> 33:35.124
So, every 15 minutes,
they keep coming back to...

33:35.657 --> 33:37.093
Hey, Richard!

33:38.760 --> 33:40.126
- Richard!
- I gotta get this.

33:40.128 --> 33:42.062
I gotta get this,
I'll talk to you later.

33:42.064 --> 33:43.495
We'll see you at the office.

33:43.497 --> 33:45.834
Richard. Richard!

33:47.237 --> 33:48.804
Hey, hey, man, hey, buddy.

33:50.273 --> 33:51.605
- It's me.
- I know!

33:51.607 --> 33:54.406
I can see that...
Hold, yeah, really.

33:54.408 --> 33:55.811
No, no, no, for sure, for sure.

33:56.912 --> 33:59.114
Yeah, I'll see you in ten,
I'll see you, all right.

34:00.748 --> 34:03.616
- Wow, look at you.
- Hey, hey.

34:03.618 --> 34:05.050
And I'm not the only one.

34:05.052 --> 34:07.655
Crazy shit is happening
to the other guys too.

34:08.656 --> 34:10.491
- What other guys?
- My old team.

34:12.560 --> 34:15.960
- Are you off your meds?
- Don't do that.

34:15.963 --> 34:18.397
Please, don't give me that
bullshit patronizing look

34:18.399 --> 34:19.665
like I'm crazy, man.

34:19.667 --> 34:21.768
Come see for yourself,
all right?

34:22.702 --> 34:24.904
Five minutes, five minutes.

34:24.906 --> 34:26.606
Come see for yourself,
come see for yourself.

34:28.641 --> 34:32.012
All right, I'd like you to meet
Jonesie McAlpine,

34:32.579 --> 34:35.216
the baddest US Marshal you
could have watching your six.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.217
Just hear him out, all right?

34:38.219 --> 34:39.452
Keep an open mind.

34:40.687 --> 34:42.253
Jonesie, tell him
what you told me.

34:42.255 --> 34:43.556
Tell him about Davis.

34:44.824 --> 34:46.192
He knows, he's in on it.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.561
Richard is here
to help us, brother.

34:50.596 --> 34:53.030
Look, man, we were exposed to
some sort of chemical or some...

34:53.032 --> 34:54.965
Here we go,
we're just gonna go down

34:54.967 --> 34:57.000
the dark hole
of conspiracy theories.

34:57.002 --> 34:59.237
No, there's historical
precedent for this, man.

34:59.239 --> 35:01.205
Think about what they did
to the Tuskegee Airmen

35:01.207 --> 35:02.606
or the LSD trials in 'Nam.

35:02.608 --> 35:03.707
I'm not thinking about it.

35:03.709 --> 35:05.410
You can't trust him.

35:07.479 --> 35:08.747
What the hell was that?

35:13.651 --> 35:15.453
Something's going on out there.

35:16.721 --> 35:17.922
What did you do?

35:18.623 --> 35:19.791
Stay in the damn car.

35:26.365 --> 35:28.633
Richard, hey.

35:30.302 --> 35:31.202
Richard.

35:31.836 --> 35:33.171
I was there for you, man.

35:34.005 --> 35:35.603
Man, I was there for you.

35:44.748 --> 35:46.084
Unbelievable.

35:48.786 --> 35:50.888
Yes, you were there
when Karen passed,

35:51.456 --> 35:54.923
and yes, you let me handle your
security company's legal work

35:54.925 --> 35:57.225
when everyone else
wouldn't give me a fucking job.

35:57.227 --> 35:58.827
And I don't wanna bring
that up...

35:58.829 --> 36:00.395
No, but... but... but you are
bringing it up.

36:00.397 --> 36:03.864
You are in a crass and
a manipulative way.

36:03.866 --> 36:05.966
So let's go there,
you know, why not?

36:05.968 --> 36:09.404
Okay, who handled
your malpractice suit

36:09.406 --> 36:11.072
when you had your breakdown?

36:11.074 --> 36:13.008
Oh, no that... That was a legal
shakedown and you know it.

36:13.010 --> 36:15.076
Yes, that you were
supposed to settle legally,

36:15.078 --> 36:16.844
but you just beat the shit
out of your client

36:16.846 --> 36:18.246
that you were supposed
to protect.

36:18.248 --> 36:20.448
- He was a scumbag, man.
- Be that as it may,

36:20.450 --> 36:22.316
you're lucky you didn't do time.

36:22.318 --> 36:24.218
That practice was my livelihood.

36:24.220 --> 36:26.753
I said that
with all you went through

36:26.755 --> 36:28.489
that it was no wonder
that you would suffer

36:28.491 --> 36:31.891
some emotional trauma,
and the judge, he bought it,

36:31.893 --> 36:34.431
and all you had to do
was go into rehab.

36:34.964 --> 36:37.097
- I lost everything.
- No, no, nope.

36:37.099 --> 36:38.832
Not everything, not everything,

36:38.834 --> 36:41.435
because I managed to get
some of it in a trust

36:41.437 --> 36:45.573
for Sundari if you just
stayed in the program.

36:46.307 --> 36:48.374
That's all you had to do,
was stay in the program.

36:48.376 --> 36:50.575
No, no, no,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

36:50.577 --> 36:53.745
That place was overcrowded,
it was full of crazies.

36:53.747 --> 36:55.114
I didn't belong there.

36:55.116 --> 36:57.015
Yeah, and it was
filthy too, right?

36:57.017 --> 36:59.520
- All them giant cockroaches.
- Okay, all right, yeah, yeah.

36:59.522 --> 37:01.356
I have a problem, I own that,

37:01.956 --> 37:04.723
but, look, I'm not the only one.

37:04.725 --> 37:06.192
You're connected, man.

37:06.194 --> 37:08.060
What about your uncle,
your uncle in the FBI?

37:08.062 --> 37:09.928
He retired like eight years ago.

37:09.930 --> 37:12.066
Richie, what if
there's a cure for this shit?

37:12.833 --> 37:14.166
I'm not looking for vengeance,

37:14.168 --> 37:15.803
we're just looking
for some answers.

37:17.471 --> 37:18.769
Man...

37:18.771 --> 37:20.805
you have no idea
what it's like

37:20.807 --> 37:22.074
to look at the love
of your life

37:22.076 --> 37:25.079
and see
that she's terrified of you.

37:34.654 --> 37:36.022
Sundari went through a lot.

37:37.790 --> 37:39.425
You've been divorced
for over a year.

37:40.159 --> 37:42.093
You really need to call her.

37:42.095 --> 37:44.963
I call,
she won't answer my calls.

37:46.467 --> 37:48.400
I know she's my soul mate

37:48.402 --> 37:50.803
<i>and I know we're gonna
be together again.</i>

37:52.171 --> 37:55.141
But, she needs to be
proud of me again.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.710
<i>I need my life back.</i>

38:01.379 --> 38:02.280
Please.

38:07.852 --> 38:09.221
All right.

38:13.058 --> 38:14.357
Call this doctor.

38:14.359 --> 38:16.893
No, no,
I can't deal with any more

38:16.895 --> 38:19.661
chemical head shrinkers
and all the medication, man.

38:19.663 --> 38:22.334
He's holistic,
he's a naturalist.

38:23.100 --> 38:25.568
Private, I'll pay for it.

38:25.570 --> 38:26.471
You do that.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.670
I'll check around and see
what I can find out.

38:31.442 --> 38:32.876
You do that.

38:34.346 --> 38:35.280
Okay?

38:40.718 --> 38:42.052
Thanks, Richie.

39:05.775 --> 39:06.943
We got a problem.

39:17.152 --> 39:18.220
Shit.

39:20.556 --> 39:23.792
Oh, yeah, that's funny.
Oh, yeah, that's real funny.

39:25.461 --> 39:26.728
You feel better?

39:27.229 --> 39:28.163
Good.

39:28.830 --> 39:30.399
<i>You blew up a billboard.</i>

39:30.966 --> 39:32.234
What if somebody got hurt?

39:33.068 --> 39:34.902
It was false advertising.

39:35.504 --> 39:37.136
They were selling lies.

39:37.138 --> 39:38.373
And no one got hurt.

39:48.883 --> 39:50.385
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

39:51.219 --> 39:53.919
- Happy birthday!
- Chief!

39:53.921 --> 39:57.489
Chief! Chief!

40:01.229 --> 40:03.029
Welcome to the party, man.

40:03.897 --> 40:06.364
- Jonesie, you got me.
- No, no, no, no, no!

40:06.366 --> 40:08.967
Motherfucker, stop,
come on, just once!

40:08.969 --> 40:10.970
- Relax!
- Oh, shit.

40:10.972 --> 40:13.239
What happened?
Who fired the maid?

40:13.241 --> 40:15.139
Don't worry about this,
we'll clean this up.

40:15.141 --> 40:16.977
- But right now...
- We got this, it's fine. It's fine.

40:18.345 --> 40:20.144
Cheers.
Jonesie, you pulled that off.

40:20.146 --> 40:21.913
Don't ever doubt me again, man.

40:21.915 --> 40:23.316
Yo, let's raise the glass...

40:24.484 --> 40:28.521
to the motherfucking HNIC
born on the 4th of July.

40:29.456 --> 40:32.022
My man. Happy birthday.

40:32.024 --> 40:33.925
There's God
and then there's you, Chief.

40:33.927 --> 40:35.828
It might be
the same motherfucker.

40:36.762 --> 40:37.997
Oh, shit!

40:39.466 --> 40:41.765
Jonesie,
that is the ugliest goddamn cake

40:41.767 --> 40:42.868
in the world.

40:43.469 --> 40:44.403
Shut up, Merc.

40:45.739 --> 40:46.739
You do know...

40:47.573 --> 40:49.941
you're the only man that
coulda got us out alive.

40:50.576 --> 40:51.909
The world will never know.

40:53.878 --> 40:55.046
But we do.

40:56.180 --> 40:57.248
Yep.

40:57.950 --> 40:59.650
Happy birthday, Chief.

40:59.652 --> 41:01.020
Happy birthday, Chief.

41:01.754 --> 41:02.854
Thank you.

41:14.198 --> 41:15.498
How come
they get the latest gear

41:15.500 --> 41:17.065
and we still have to buy
our own shit?

41:17.067 --> 41:18.601
I thought
we were negotiating.

41:18.603 --> 41:20.101
Now the FBI's rolling in?

41:20.103 --> 41:22.305
- Our catch, FBI's glory.
- Hey, put that thing away.

41:22.307 --> 41:24.342
Negotiation's over.
We're backup now.

41:29.247 --> 41:30.381
We're in position.

41:31.649 --> 41:33.716
You got the dream team here.
You think we can clock out?

41:33.718 --> 41:35.552
Wifey got your birthday cake
coming out the oven.

41:38.921 --> 41:40.455
Jesus Christ!

41:40.457 --> 41:42.290
<i>Man down, we need backup!</i>

41:42.292 --> 41:44.091
- Come on, we're going in. Go.
- What?

41:44.093 --> 41:45.528
- This is bullshit!
- That's an order!

41:52.669 --> 41:53.836
Take left.

41:56.540 --> 41:58.240
- Go.
- I got your six, Chief.

42:10.553 --> 42:11.753
I need a medic.

43:24.758 --> 43:26.626
Chief, you need to see this.

43:39.271 --> 43:40.603
You know,
the irony in this shit

43:40.605 --> 43:42.505
is I did everything
the right way,

43:42.507 --> 43:45.375
to make sure I wasn't killed
by no thug or no crazy Five-O.

43:45.377 --> 43:47.480
- Turell's life matters.
- Goddamn right.

43:50.883 --> 43:52.184
I got a baby girl, Chief.

43:54.486 --> 43:57.353
I have got to get straight,
fast.

43:57.355 --> 43:58.855
I was having
the same symptoms.

43:58.857 --> 44:00.255
- It can't be a coincidence.
- Can't be.

44:00.257 --> 44:01.292
It's the anniversary.

44:01.860 --> 44:05.294
Fucked up time of year.
Those damn fireworks!

44:05.296 --> 44:07.029
Light one again
and I'll stick it up your ass.

44:07.031 --> 44:09.164
I'll shit down your neck, KC!

44:09.166 --> 44:11.868
- Get a fucking room.
- Romans 12:19,

44:11.870 --> 44:16.104
"Vengeance is mine,
I will repay," sayeth the Lord.

44:16.106 --> 44:18.242
We trust you
with our lives, Chief.

44:18.809 --> 44:20.444
Lead the way.

44:26.216 --> 44:27.582
Most people don't trust me

44:27.584 --> 44:29.383
to cut their hair anymore
these days.

44:29.385 --> 44:30.553
We need you, brother.

44:31.654 --> 44:32.622
Right this wrong.

44:35.860 --> 44:37.227
Come on Chief, please.

44:53.408 --> 44:56.476
All right.
Let's get some answers.

44:56.478 --> 44:58.346
Let's get some
motherfucking answers, baby.

44:58.348 --> 45:00.548
- About damn time.
- That's what I'm talking about.

45:02.050 --> 45:04.050
We want to stop this crazy shit,

45:04.052 --> 45:05.685
we gotta be united.

45:05.687 --> 45:06.988
- Damn right.
- Whatever they do to one of us,

45:06.990 --> 45:08.255
they're gonna do to all of us.

45:08.257 --> 45:10.590
- We're in this together.
- Hoorah!

45:10.592 --> 45:12.191
We gonna fuck somebody up,
Chief.

45:12.193 --> 45:13.560
Okay, now look,
you want me leading this op,

45:13.562 --> 45:15.294
there's gonna be three rules.

45:15.296 --> 45:18.399
One, no more crazy talk.

45:19.001 --> 45:20.666
None of that leaves this room.

45:20.668 --> 45:24.473
Two, we don't know who's
messing with our heads, right?

45:25.206 --> 45:27.373
So, until we do,
I'm gonna need a little time

45:27.375 --> 45:30.309
to identify a clear target
and a strategy.

45:30.311 --> 45:32.780
And three,
until I get that intel,

45:33.281 --> 45:35.414
this mission requires
that we stay cool.

45:35.416 --> 45:37.752
- Cool breeze, baby.
- That's right, cool.

45:39.854 --> 45:40.920
And that we are unarmed.

45:40.922 --> 45:42.021
- What?
- What?

45:42.023 --> 45:43.123
Hell no!

45:44.090 --> 45:45.058
I'm an American.

45:45.560 --> 45:47.593
I have the right
to bear more arms

45:47.595 --> 45:49.361
than anybody on this planet.

45:49.363 --> 45:50.496
You better tell him something,
Merc.

45:50.498 --> 45:52.330
From my cold, dead hands, Chief.

45:52.332 --> 45:54.833
You're messing with
our Second Amendment, Chief.

45:54.835 --> 45:58.169
We could level
an entire city block.

45:58.171 --> 45:59.571
That'll get their attention.

45:59.573 --> 46:01.639
Draw them out,
make them negotiate.

46:01.641 --> 46:03.474
And what's the exit strategy?

46:03.476 --> 46:06.276
You wanna end up on the TV
shot up like a bunch of crazies?

46:06.278 --> 46:07.680
We're all better than that.

46:08.547 --> 46:09.449
Look.

46:10.483 --> 46:13.253
Let's just consider this
our war chest.

46:14.287 --> 46:15.622
You want me leading this op,

46:16.155 --> 46:17.454
you stow your weapon in there

46:17.456 --> 46:19.025
until I say
we're ready to use it.

46:19.525 --> 46:21.061
Mm-mm, I can't do that.

46:21.794 --> 46:24.494
- I can't do that.
- I ain't givin' up nothin'.

46:24.496 --> 46:26.097
I ain't givin' up
my damn weapon.

46:39.578 --> 46:41.780
Chief already got us
a brand new, shiny,

46:42.413 --> 46:45.350
federal backstage pass.
I say we give him a week.

the bombs bursting in air,

48:16.337 --> 48:18.807
that our flag was still there.

Come on, Chief,
we're waiting on you, man.

49:44.155 --> 49:46.656

49:48.960 --> 49:50.095
Come on, Chief.

49:52.696 --> 49:54.532
Yeah,
try telling that to Jonesie.

we do what we do.

50:04.241 --> 50:06.076

Whatever happened
to your hair, boy?

53:06.316 --> 53:08.649
- Grandpa V, you're still alive.
- Hell yeah!

53:08.651 --> 53:11.485
We sure as hell couldn't beat
this family shit in spirit.

53:11.487 --> 53:12.786
I came in person.

53:12.788 --> 53:15.022
V, what'd I tell you, hm?

53:15.024 --> 53:17.624
- He don't look crazy.
- He looks good, Daddy.

53:17.626 --> 53:18.959
Good to see you, son.

53:18.961 --> 53:21.196
Come on inside
and fix me a drink.

53:21.198 --> 53:22.629
Uh, I wasn't invited.

53:22.631 --> 53:23.998
I just came by
to check things out.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.236
That's nice, but you come on,
mm-hm.

53:27.003 --> 53:29.670
- He's still a bully, ain't he?
- Nothing changed.

53:29.672 --> 53:31.038
Don't write no check
with your mouth

53:31.040 --> 53:32.707
your ass can't cash, son.

53:43.617 --> 53:45.819
- Hey!
- Shirley!

53:45.821 --> 53:48.654
- You look so good.
- I'm supposed to.

53:48.656 --> 53:51.057
You make me wish
I had my Viagra.

53:51.059 --> 53:52.592
Well, you shoulda brought two.

53:52.594 --> 53:54.095
You know I brought
a friend with me.

53:54.662 --> 53:56.595
We sure had some fun,
didn't we?

53:56.597 --> 53:57.999
The world will never know.

53:58.632 --> 53:59.833
Oh, thank you.

54:01.102 --> 54:02.268
Thank you.

54:02.270 --> 54:04.569
Toast. May you have all you want

54:04.571 --> 54:05.837
and want all you have.

54:05.839 --> 54:07.608
- Sounds good to me.
- Oh, Kashi!

54:11.012 --> 54:14.946
Oh, my goodness,
you look so amazing!

54:14.948 --> 54:18.683
Oh! If anyone deserves this,
you do.

54:18.685 --> 54:20.352
- Hi!
- Oh, my God!

54:20.354 --> 54:21.889
There she is.

54:47.280 --> 54:48.181
You okay, bro?

54:49.348 --> 54:51.049
Yeah. Yeah, listen...

54:52.150 --> 54:53.118
I gotta bounce.

54:56.421 --> 54:57.623
I'll see you later.

54:59.859 --> 55:01.726
Oh, I'm sorry.

55:02.328 --> 55:05.597
I'm... I'm so sorry.
I can't believe that happened.

55:06.098 --> 55:07.132

Jason.

55:18.477 --> 55:19.875
Speech, speech.

55:19.877 --> 55:22.579
Okay, I tried to write
something poetic,

55:22.581 --> 55:23.949
but it all seems trite now.

55:24.983 --> 55:27.219
The truth is,
I've been through a lot.

55:27.751 --> 55:30.853
I never thought that someone
who'd seen me at my worst

55:30.855 --> 55:32.623
could still want me and love me.

55:33.724 --> 55:35.424
I've seen him at his worst.

55:35.426 --> 55:36.560
He's been there all along.

55:37.495 --> 55:41.132
He's been my friend,
my confidant, my lover.

55:42.799 --> 55:43.967
Darling, please come up here.

55:45.002 --> 55:46.335
Next month in India,

55:46.337 --> 55:48.139
he'll officially become
my husband.

56:00.450 --> 56:02.718
Honey, honey, honey,
sorry I'm late.

56:11.928 --> 56:13.296
Ah, thank you so much.

56:13.830 --> 56:15.396
Thanks, everybody,
for being here.

56:15.398 --> 56:19.400
Really, everyone, far and wide,
I really appreciate it.

56:19.402 --> 56:21.701
Love you all,
love her a little bit more,

56:21.703 --> 56:23.537
but love you all.

56:23.539 --> 56:25.739
Happiest guy in the world right
now, that's all I can say.

56:25.741 --> 56:26.842
So glad you're here.

56:30.811 --> 56:32.612
Do we have to wait
a whole month?

56:34.082 --> 56:35.951
I'm amazed, I'm... I just...

56:37.119 --> 56:38.954
Thanks, everyone,
for sharing this moment.

56:39.655 --> 56:41.121
Cheers, everyone.

56:41.123 --> 56:43.256
- Cheers!
- Love you all.

57:03.611 --> 57:06.214
Hey!

57:08.216 --> 57:11.117
- Oh, shit, dude!
- Oh, my God!

57:17.557 --> 57:19.957
- Cheers.
- Thank you, thank you.

57:27.400 --> 57:28.801
Why are you here?

57:35.675 --> 57:36.942
Honey, please don't do this.

57:49.888 --> 57:51.090
Please don't do this.

57:55.793 --> 57:57.061
He's got a gun!

57:57.630 --> 57:59.363
Jason, Jason!

58:15.480 --> 58:16.481
Chief.

58:17.682 --> 58:18.950
That boy needs help.

59:06.495 --> 59:07.961
Mr. Busy made it.

59:07.963 --> 59:09.665
Can you pass me
the indigo please?

59:10.333 --> 59:13.001
How can we have an indigo fairy
princess without blue, huh?

59:13.968 --> 59:15.103
Indigo blue?

59:17.339 --> 59:18.873
Hey, Grace,
where should I put the DJ?

59:19.574 --> 59:21.976
Hmm, can you do the honors
for me, sir?

59:22.678 --> 59:24.110
He has magical powers,

59:24.112 --> 59:25.713
so if you're very nice
and sit very still,

59:25.715 --> 59:29.015
he'll transform you into
the awesome indigo princess.

59:29.017 --> 59:31.751
But he doesn't have
the nose for magic.

59:33.221 --> 59:34.554
He has the magic.

59:34.556 --> 59:36.291
He just can't remember
how to use it.

59:39.126 --> 59:40.361
Boop.

59:52.373 --> 59:54.274
Well, wish me luck.

59:57.544 --> 59:59.546
Well, if you want
to reschedule, I'm flexible.

01:00:00.647 --> 01:00:02.549
Don't wanna cancel you
altogether.

01:00:04.117 --> 01:00:05.552
Yeah, I'm disappointed.

01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:11.956
Oh, wow, look at you, princess.

01:00:11.958 --> 01:00:13.394
Chief Magic Hands.

01:00:13.926 --> 01:00:16.262
And he's teaching me
the magic words.

01:00:16.797 --> 01:00:19.263
- Poetry,
- See, I trusted him.

01:00:19.265 --> 01:00:21.198
Now he trusts me.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.635
Sounds like a life metaphor.

01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:27.237
- I'll have cat whiskers.
- I'm next after her.

Ha, see? An unbiased opinion.

01:02:40.568 --> 01:02:42.236
You didn't react

01:02:42.737 --> 01:02:45.405

the beetle crawling up your arm.

01:02:52.145 --> 01:02:53.346

01:02:54.014 --> 01:02:55.047
Of course.

01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:57.585

any living creature either.

01:09:43.206 --> 01:09:44.640
Third choice.

01:09:44.642 --> 01:09:47.076
Whatever, okay.
Point is, you are inviting me,

01:09:47.078 --> 01:09:50.912
and you know that I'm unemployed
and I'm divorced

01:09:50.915 --> 01:09:52.716
and I'm going through
a lot of shit right now.

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:54.985
Yes, and we get back on Monday.

01:09:56.086 --> 01:09:57.120
Well...

01:10:00.523 --> 01:10:02.125
<i>Yeah, well, you know what, um,</i>

01:10:02.792 --> 01:10:04.627
I do need to get
my head together.

01:10:05.628 --> 01:10:07.496
So, this isn't an ego bruiser?

01:10:10.767 --> 01:10:13.837
I don't think I have
much ego left to bruise.

01:10:16.073 --> 01:10:19.073
I'll pick you up
tomorrow morning at 08:00 a.m.

01:10:19.075 --> 01:10:20.910
Okay. 0800.

01:10:21.577 --> 01:10:22.912
<i>I'll be ready.</i>

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:40.928
<i>♪ Don't shoot us down ♪</i>

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:43.999

01:10:44.899 --> 01:10:48.436
<i>♪ Dirt on the ground ♪</i>

01:10:49.471 --> 01:10:56.611
<i>♪ Still the world

01:10:58.146 --> 01:11:00.446
Hey, uh, you know what,
don't touch that one.

01:11:00.448 --> 01:11:01.750
It's wired to blow.

01:11:02.516 --> 01:11:03.785
Funny.

01:11:12.494 --> 01:11:16.296
<i>♪ The world just goes around ♪</i>

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.002
This cabin is built on the edge
of the national forest.

01:11:24.439 --> 01:11:25.806
It seems endless.

01:11:32.612 --> 01:11:34.446
My wife always used to say,

01:11:34.448 --> 01:11:35.782
"Nature is God's art."

01:11:36.483 --> 01:11:38.548
But... what if we believe

01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:39.819
there are killers out here,

01:11:40.386 --> 01:11:41.921
waiting to get us right now?

01:11:42.522 --> 01:11:43.787
If we believe that,

01:11:43.789 --> 01:11:45.591
all of this
would seem scary, right?

01:11:47.827 --> 01:11:49.560
They say that people
who believe in Jesus

01:11:49.562 --> 01:11:50.895
see him when they die,

01:11:50.897 --> 01:11:52.296
and Buddhists see Buddha,

01:11:52.298 --> 01:11:54.798
and kids who have
near-death experiences

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.070
say they see the white light
and fuzzy animals.

01:11:57.836 --> 01:11:59.470
What if you don't know
what you believe?

01:11:59.472 --> 01:12:01.805
Then you see
departed friends or family.

01:12:01.807 --> 01:12:03.141
Whatever helps you transition.

01:12:03.809 --> 01:12:05.341
You think we see what we expect?

01:12:05.343 --> 01:12:07.312
In life and death,
it's all about perspective.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.149
Close your eyes.

01:12:12.117 --> 01:12:13.251
Close your eyes!

01:12:14.753 --> 01:12:15.654
What are you seeing?

01:12:16.788 --> 01:12:19.122
<i>I see my buddies having
a nervous breakdown</i>

01:12:19.124 --> 01:12:21.059
<i>and my best friend
fucking my wife.</i>

01:12:22.793 --> 01:12:24.095
And what else?

01:12:25.096 --> 01:12:28.165
Mm... you got nice boobs.

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.603
And I'm too old for you.

01:12:33.371 --> 01:12:34.636
And?

01:12:34.638 --> 01:12:36.207
And maybe
I'm disappointed in me,

01:12:36.941 --> 01:12:38.774
that I couldn't be
the better man and...

01:12:38.776 --> 01:12:40.211
just wish 'em both well.

01:12:46.183 --> 01:12:48.084
Maybe I'm afraid of dying alone,

01:12:48.685 --> 01:12:51.555
not amounting to much.

01:12:52.122 --> 01:12:53.756
Just no one giving a shit.

01:12:58.028 --> 01:12:59.696
We all crave recognition.

01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:02.098
We all look for love.

01:13:04.434 --> 01:13:08.071
Well... I'd settle
for some attention.

I'll cut you like
a fish if you lie to me.

01:15:48.859 --> 01:15:49.859
What did he tell you?

01:15:50.394 --> 01:15:52.127
- Please, I don't know.
- Hey!

01:15:52.129 --> 01:15:53.297
Wrong answer.

01:16:01.237 --> 01:16:03.404
Why do all you bitches lie?

01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:35.003
You okay?

01:16:41.176 --> 01:16:43.378
Go back to sleep,
you silly man.

01:17:02.162 --> 01:17:03.831
If you're a nudist,
aren't you supposed to be nude?

01:17:04.598 --> 01:17:07.568
- Wishful thinker.
- False advertiser.

01:17:08.635 --> 01:17:09.902
Sure.

01:17:12.305 --> 01:17:15.174
So, what happened last night?

01:17:16.476 --> 01:17:18.442
I think your yoga tape
just gave me

01:17:18.444 --> 01:17:20.247
some freaked-out dreams is all.

01:17:21.415 --> 01:17:23.316
I'm gonna make us
that bomb vegan dinner tonight.

01:17:23.817 --> 01:17:25.351
- No dead animals?
- No.

01:17:25.952 --> 01:17:27.253
And you won't even miss them.

01:17:29.389 --> 01:17:30.423
Adios!

01:18:09.261 --> 01:18:11.996
<i>Jonesie,
you've been spying on my wife?</i>

01:18:13.097 --> 01:18:14.563
<i>It's called recon, sir.</i>

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:15.966
<i>Something you
should've done more of.</i>

01:18:16.467 --> 01:18:18.935
<i>It means you can't trust
none of these motherfuckers.</i>

01:18:28.244 --> 01:18:30.812
Jonesie, it's for your own good.

01:18:30.814 --> 01:18:32.383
I gotta put this somewhere safe.

01:18:35.952 --> 01:18:37.187
No one's gonna get hurt.

01:18:38.988 --> 01:18:40.123
We all good.

01:18:51.734 --> 01:18:53.669
Safe keeping.

01:19:11.118 --> 01:19:13.152
- Hello?
- <i>You fucked us.</i>

01:19:13.154 --> 01:19:14.556
<i>For that yoga bitch?</i>

01:19:15.456 --> 01:19:16.857
Jonesie?

01:19:16.859 --> 01:19:18.626
<i>Now I have
to come after both of you.</i>

01:19:19.661 --> 01:19:20.996
Jonesie!

01:19:24.065 --> 01:19:25.066
Jonesie!

01:19:25.567 --> 01:19:28.569
Jonesie.

01:19:29.938 --> 01:19:31.570
You've been tracking me
through my cell phone

01:19:31.572 --> 01:19:33.441
this whole time,
huh, motherfucker?

01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:36.375
Jonesie!

01:19:36.377 --> 01:19:38.276
<i>Hello,
I'm not there to take your call.</i>

01:19:38.278 --> 01:19:40.044
- <i>If you leave me a message, I'll get back to you...</i>
- Shit.

01:19:40.046 --> 01:19:42.180
<i>...as soon as I get this.</i>

01:19:42.182 --> 01:19:43.716
Grace.

01:19:43.718 --> 01:19:44.783
Grace, listen, listen,

01:19:44.785 --> 01:19:46.387
I want you to lock
all the doors.

01:19:48.021 --> 01:19:49.155
Shit.

01:19:56.496 --> 01:19:57.631
Hey!

01:20:10.844 --> 01:20:11.745
Hey!

01:20:12.279 --> 01:20:13.580
I just need directions!

01:20:18.685 --> 01:20:20.252
Man, I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:20:25.524 --> 01:20:26.458
Hey!

01:20:37.503 --> 01:20:38.835
- Hey.
- God no, don't hurt me.

01:20:38.837 --> 01:20:40.437
- Hey.
- Don't hurt me, don't hurt me.

01:20:40.439 --> 01:20:42.338
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:43.776
I'm not gonna hurt you...
you okay?

01:20:48.313 --> 01:20:51.314
We're all goin'...
we're all goin' to hell.

01:20:51.316 --> 01:20:52.684
Hands in the air.

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.622
I said get them goddamn
hands in the air.

01:20:59.257 --> 01:21:01.159
- I didn't say nothing.
- Shut up, faggot.

01:21:03.226 --> 01:21:04.328
Drop the shovel.

01:21:10.634 --> 01:21:12.167
Hm...

01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:14.738
Uh-uh.

01:21:15.973 --> 01:21:17.273
This meant for us?

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.581
How many of 'em are you?

01:21:25.215 --> 01:21:26.116
I'm alone.

01:21:26.984 --> 01:21:31.953
I... I didn't see nobody else,
I swear.

01:21:31.955 --> 01:21:34.254
Shut the fuck up,
what'd I tell you?

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:35.458
Now get your ass up.

01:21:35.959 --> 01:21:37.491
Get your fuckin' ass up.

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:38.961
You, get over there,
behind him, march.

01:21:39.495 --> 01:21:40.997
In a line,
get your ass over there.

01:21:41.764 --> 01:21:44.533
Don't you look back at me, boy.
This is gonna end bad for you.

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:53.743
Eyes forward.

01:21:54.710 --> 01:21:56.411
Get your ass over that bridge.

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:00.582
Turn around, walk your ass on.

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:03.483
Oh, Meth!

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:04.886
Look what I brung ya.

01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:10.090
Well, what do we have here?

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:12.494
Dumb, plus one.

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:15.895
Shitface, wake your ass up.

01:22:15.897 --> 01:22:17.930
Fellas, what's going on?

01:22:17.932 --> 01:22:21.400
What's goin' on is...

01:22:21.402 --> 01:22:23.805
...is I ask the questions,
asshole.

01:22:27.941 --> 01:22:30.044
Where is it, huh? Huh?

01:22:30.911 --> 01:22:33.746
- Ain't got no badge?
- Yeah, he had a piece.

01:22:33.748 --> 01:22:35.748
We should just go
and clear out of here

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:39.018
- while we got t... time.
- I got a better idea.

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.522
You shut the fuck up,
you lock him up.

01:22:42.089 --> 01:22:43.289
Yes, sir.

01:23:16.555 --> 01:23:18.021
<i>Grace, listen.</i>

01:23:18.023 --> 01:23:19.457
<i>Listen, I want you
to lock all the doors.</i>

01:23:34.338 --> 01:23:36.407
Shut the fuck up!

01:23:47.619 --> 01:23:50.755
If you can meet with triumph
and disaster,

01:23:52.256 --> 01:23:54.757
and treat those two imposters
just the same...

01:23:54.759 --> 01:23:57.628
You can dream
and not make dreams your master.

01:23:59.797 --> 01:24:01.564
Told you this is all FUBAR.

01:24:02.099 --> 01:24:03.397
This time you're on your own.

01:24:03.399 --> 01:24:04.332
Jonesie, quit fuckin' around

01:24:04.334 --> 01:24:05.533
and get me out of here.

01:24:38.634 --> 01:24:39.936
What the fuck is going on?

01:24:42.071 --> 01:24:43.305
I think you know.

01:24:45.974 --> 01:24:46.909
He didn't see you.

01:24:55.218 --> 01:24:56.385
I'm your IF.

01:24:58.053 --> 01:24:59.254
Your imaginary friend.

01:24:59.755 --> 01:25:00.923
Just like your roaches.

01:25:05.294 --> 01:25:06.427
That's right, Chief.

01:25:07.929 --> 01:25:09.162
Think back.

01:25:13.768 --> 01:25:15.234
Jonesie.

01:25:15.236 --> 01:25:16.503
You look exactly the same, man.

01:25:17.104 --> 01:25:20.106
- What's this all about?
- You needed me, so here I am.

01:25:20.108 --> 01:25:21.075
Pachelbel.

01:25:22.009 --> 01:25:23.110
Keep your head straight.

01:25:24.078 --> 01:25:25.847

Are you freaking following me?

01:25:50.469 --> 01:25:51.671
No!

01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:54.138
- No.
- Jonesie...

01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:55.706
- Don't say anything.
- ...tell 'em what you told me.

01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:57.443
He's gonna think you're crazy.

01:26:03.182 --> 01:26:05.017
You're crazier than me.

01:26:11.258 --> 01:26:13.058
Jonesie. Jonesie!

01:26:13.659 --> 01:26:14.927
Get your shit together.

01:26:16.262 --> 01:26:18.630
You're crazy. You're crazy!

01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:20.665
No one got hurt, right?

01:26:21.166 --> 01:26:22.067
Huh?

01:26:25.403 --> 01:26:27.005
You gonna give me shave too?

01:26:27.972 --> 01:26:29.906
Hey.

01:26:29.908 --> 01:26:31.143
Who wants to do the honors?

01:26:54.630 --> 01:26:56.165
are losing theirs
and blaming it on you,

01:26:56.167 --> 01:26:58.334
if you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you

01:26:58.336 --> 01:27:00.568
but make allowances
for their doubting too.

01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:02.172
If you can wait
and not be tired by waiting,

01:27:02.673 --> 01:27:03.907
or being lied about...

01:27:04.942 --> 01:27:06.442
Happy birthday, Chief.

01:27:07.244 --> 01:27:08.609
To the only motherfucker

01:27:08.611 --> 01:27:10.412
who could have gotten us
out of here alive.

01:27:10.414 --> 01:27:11.879
- <i>Look at him right here.</i>
- <i>Ah, it's his birthday.</i>

01:27:11.881 --> 01:27:14.048
- <i>Oh.</i>
- <i>Whose birthday is it?</i>

01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:16.252
<i>Look at this dude, look at
this ugly son of a bitch right here.</i>

01:27:17.219 --> 01:27:20.322
- <i>HNIC, born on the what?</i>
- <i>4th of July.</i>

01:27:20.324 --> 01:27:21.890
- <i>Woo!
- Hey.</i>

- <i>Get in there, Merc.</i>

01:27:24.927 --> 01:27:26.694
- <i>But we do.</i>
- We do.

01:27:29.732 --> 01:27:31.198
<i>Yeah, let's get to fuckin' work.</i>

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.900

01:27:39.908 --> 01:27:41.741

Who are you?
Who do you fuckin' work for?

01:32:07.865 --> 01:32:09.499
I don't know.

01:32:09.501 --> 01:32:10.402
You don't know?

01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:15.006
He don't know. He don't know.

01:32:17.075 --> 01:32:19.242
We're at what is called
an impasse.

01:32:19.244 --> 01:32:22.010
But what if he really is
just alone?

01:32:22.012 --> 01:32:25.247
What if there's an army
of FBI agents out there

01:32:25.249 --> 01:32:26.948
waitin' to ambush us, eh?

01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:28.085
What then?

01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:33.989
Know what I think?

01:32:33.991 --> 01:32:36.226
I think it's time to play
burn blackie.

01:32:38.328 --> 01:32:42.399
Let's see just how pink you are
on the inside, boy.

01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:44.432
No.

01:33:00.684 --> 01:33:01.984
Chief!

01:33:06.756 --> 01:33:10.990
- Chief. Hello!
- I just want you to know

01:33:10.992 --> 01:33:14.260
I'm not just
some deplorable hick asshole,

01:33:14.262 --> 01:33:17.297
but somebody's gotta get shit
done around here,

01:33:17.299 --> 01:33:19.535
and there's a chain
of goddamn command.

01:33:21.803 --> 01:33:23.105
Come on now, here we go.

01:33:23.606 --> 01:33:24.540
Step up in there.

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.542
We're gonna have us some fun.

01:33:27.075 --> 01:33:28.176
Right this way.

01:33:28.778 --> 01:33:30.145
Oh, honey.

01:33:30.645 --> 01:33:33.046
- Just keep on walkin'.
- We're home.

01:33:33.048 --> 01:33:35.350
Oh, look at her.

01:33:35.916 --> 01:33:37.117
Now, we figured...

01:33:38.085 --> 01:33:39.818
we'd let you have a little fun.

01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:42.054
- That's right.
- Before you die.

01:33:42.056 --> 01:33:44.092
We all gonna
have some fun. Get on in there.

01:33:46.161 --> 01:33:47.395
Get you comfortable.

01:33:48.663 --> 01:33:51.497
- Woo!
- Come on, princess.

01:33:51.499 --> 01:33:53.298
- Get off me!
- Get on your back then.

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:54.667
- Get off me.
- Been getting you

01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:55.967
- ready for this.
- Stop!

01:33:55.969 --> 01:33:57.402
That's right.

01:33:57.404 --> 01:34:00.004
Hey, take it outside.
Do not puke in here.

01:34:03.276 --> 01:34:04.545
Goddamn, faggot.

01:34:06.279 --> 01:34:07.948
Where was we? Oh, yeah.

01:34:08.649 --> 01:34:11.118
You're gonna fuck her.
See, we're all done with her.

01:34:11.719 --> 01:34:14.488
- She tastes good.
- She's a celebrity!

01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:18.690
I think she looks
a little better in person,

01:34:18.692 --> 01:34:19.592
don't you?

01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:22.927
What's the matter, Barack?

01:34:22.929 --> 01:34:24.030
That's what you need.

01:34:24.630 --> 01:34:26.666
I can tell you're a man
that needs...

01:34:27.333 --> 01:34:29.535
a little mood music. Now...

01:34:31.137 --> 01:34:32.271
Let's see.

01:34:36.442 --> 01:34:38.611
Woo, that's nice there!

01:34:39.579 --> 01:34:40.513
You feel that?

01:34:41.781 --> 01:34:44.583
Start fucking.

01:34:49.454 --> 01:34:51.920
- Woo, yeah!
- Get that pig outta there.

01:34:51.922 --> 01:34:53.155
Come on now.

01:34:53.157 --> 01:34:54.225
Go ahead!

01:34:54.794 --> 01:34:55.992
Huh, what?

01:34:55.994 --> 01:34:57.362
Mm, look.

01:34:58.630 --> 01:34:59.564
At the door.

01:35:02.967 --> 01:35:04.636
Somebody's out there. Hey.

01:35:05.970 --> 01:35:07.202
Get up.

01:35:18.214 --> 01:35:20.482
I'm not here
to hurt you, okay?

01:35:20.484 --> 01:35:23.521
Now I think I can open that lock
if you have some wire.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.359
I'm so sorry to bother you,
I've lost someone

01:35:31.361 --> 01:35:33.363
and I was just wondering
if you happened to see him.

01:35:38.168 --> 01:35:40.000
Yeah,
we might could help you out.

01:35:40.002 --> 01:35:41.134
Come on inside.

01:35:46.476 --> 01:35:48.309
- Oh, shit.
- What do we have here?

01:35:48.311 --> 01:35:50.912
If it ain't our lucky day,
look at what we have here.

01:35:52.449 --> 01:35:53.681
Come on.

01:35:55.017 --> 01:35:56.584
You got to go first last time.

01:35:56.586 --> 01:35:59.219
We gonna have some fun today
with her.

01:35:59.221 --> 01:36:03.056
No!
Please don't hurt me!

01:36:03.058 --> 01:36:06.160
Please, no!

01:36:07.464 --> 01:36:09.496
- US Marshals.
- Oh, just off him.

01:36:09.498 --> 01:36:11.600
You asked me who I work for.

01:36:13.569 --> 01:36:16.672
Not FBI,
I'm with the US Marshals.

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:22.711
Hey, hey.

01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:26.113
Cut it out.
What the fuck did you just say?

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:29.383
I said I'm with
the US Marshals.

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:31.318
The proof is in the woods.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.886
What proof,
what are you talking about?

01:36:32.888 --> 01:36:35.691
We stowed all our recon gear
in a secured box.

01:36:36.491 --> 01:36:37.725
It's buried in the woods.

01:36:40.795 --> 01:36:42.328
Bullshit.

01:36:42.330 --> 01:36:45.196
Wait, I saw...
I saw him buryin' something.

01:36:45.198 --> 01:36:47.300
He had that shovel, remember?

01:36:52.005 --> 01:36:53.507
What's in the box?

01:36:55.041 --> 01:36:56.677
Forty-millimeter
grenade launcher.

01:36:57.344 --> 01:36:59.410
Two nickel plated Berettas.

01:36:59.412 --> 01:37:02.347
A SIG556 with a C Beta clip.

01:37:02.349 --> 01:37:04.150
A Mossberg 500 shotgun.

01:37:04.651 --> 01:37:07.052
And enough C-4
to level a city block.

01:37:10.256 --> 01:37:11.656
Where is it?

01:37:11.658 --> 01:37:13.390
You unchain me
and I'll take you there.

01:37:13.392 --> 01:37:15.661
I'm the decider, I decide!

01:37:18.397 --> 01:37:19.733
Let's try this again.

01:37:22.234 --> 01:37:24.804
Where is it?

01:37:26.372 --> 01:37:27.908
I buried it in a ravine

01:37:28.541 --> 01:37:32.242
- in the middle of the forest.
- I... I know where that is.

01:37:32.244 --> 01:37:34.345
I can't... take us there.

01:37:40.151 --> 01:37:41.717
Here's what's gonna happen.

01:37:41.719 --> 01:37:42.655
Meth...

01:37:43.422 --> 01:37:45.189
you take chickenshit...

01:37:46.224 --> 01:37:47.125
go check it out.

01:37:48.027 --> 01:37:50.829
You make sure he don't puke
and skip off again.

01:37:51.362 --> 01:37:53.763
Check in on the cell with me
every five minutes.

01:37:53.765 --> 01:37:54.964
If Django here is lyin',

01:37:54.966 --> 01:37:56.935
I'm gonna light his ass up
extra crispy.

01:37:57.569 --> 01:37:59.334
What if Shitface wakes up?

01:37:59.336 --> 01:38:00.970
He ain't woke up yet, has he?

01:38:00.972 --> 01:38:02.172
I'm the decider.

01:38:02.707 --> 01:38:03.607
Go.

01:38:06.844 --> 01:38:08.377
Let's go, Stew.

01:38:08.379 --> 01:38:10.314
- Get goin'.
- Well...

01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:16.119
I guess now's when we start
singin' Kumbaya.

01:38:20.257 --> 01:38:21.558
I know just where it is.

01:38:22.124 --> 01:38:24.025
And I... I'm...

01:38:24.027 --> 01:38:25.494
I know just the place.

01:38:26.063 --> 01:38:28.464
How about a little story
to pass the time?

01:38:30.132 --> 01:38:31.866
You may have noticed my brother.

01:38:31.868 --> 01:38:34.936
Well, we decided it was time
that he lost his cherry,

01:38:34.938 --> 01:38:37.273
so we got him a nice little
Catholic school girl,

01:38:37.941 --> 01:38:42.077
looked her up on Instagram,
got her to meet us at the mall,

01:38:42.079 --> 01:38:43.046
and wouldn't you believe it?

01:38:43.679 --> 01:38:46.013
She wasn't no goddamn virgin.

01:38:46.015 --> 01:38:47.182
Kids these days.

01:38:48.084 --> 01:38:49.250
I'll tell you what.

01:38:49.986 --> 01:38:52.285
But my chickenshit brother,

01:38:52.287 --> 01:38:55.090
he always starts puking,
fucking making a scene

01:38:55.092 --> 01:38:56.991
whenever there's a little bit
of pussy around,

01:38:56.993 --> 01:39:00.496
- so we had to finish the job.
- Please don't do this.

01:39:01.229 --> 01:39:04.532
What? I didn't do nothin'.
Way I figure...

01:39:06.735 --> 01:39:08.935
that there super predator
came along,

01:39:08.937 --> 01:39:11.537
found him
two perfectly good white girls,

01:39:11.539 --> 01:39:14.406
kidnapped 'em, chained 'em up
in here and raped 'em.

01:39:14.408 --> 01:39:17.676
Naughty, naughty.
Then when they tried to escape,

01:39:17.678 --> 01:39:20.480
he burned the whole place down
with them inside.

01:39:20.482 --> 01:39:21.981
But in his haste,

01:39:21.983 --> 01:39:24.484
he burned himself up
accidentally in the blaze.

01:39:24.486 --> 01:39:26.253
Oh, shit happens.

01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:30.689
We came along,
tried to help him,

01:39:30.691 --> 01:39:33.291
but, hell, you know,
the flames were too great

01:39:33.293 --> 01:39:34.626
and we just couldn't do
nothin' about it,

01:39:34.628 --> 01:39:36.928
but, you know, heroes and all,

01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:38.666
I guess
we'll probably get a reward.

01:39:42.837 --> 01:39:44.202
Oh, man.

01:39:44.204 --> 01:39:46.173
This damn phone ain't gonna work
all the way out here.

01:39:49.009 --> 01:39:50.309
Call me, dammit.

01:39:56.549 --> 01:39:57.817
I guess they took the deal.

01:39:59.318 --> 01:40:00.553
What are you talkin' about?

01:40:02.555 --> 01:40:03.923
That's why
they haven't called yet.

01:40:04.991 --> 01:40:07.025
Feds offer you a deal
to turn state's evidence,

01:40:07.027 --> 01:40:09.262
but they go for the ringleader
first, you know,

01:40:09.829 --> 01:40:11.028
chain of command.

01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:14.667
We do not recognize
federal government.

01:40:15.233 --> 01:40:16.600
Be that as it may,

01:40:16.602 --> 01:40:18.703
if you light up them cans
of kerosene

01:40:18.705 --> 01:40:20.770
and start a fire,
they're gonna recognize you.

01:40:20.772 --> 01:40:22.372
And they'll send
the smoke signals

01:40:22.374 --> 01:40:23.606
and draw 'em right to you.

01:40:23.608 --> 01:40:25.577
Ain't no goddamn fed.

01:40:30.148 --> 01:40:31.249
What's your exit strategy?

01:40:32.051 --> 01:40:36.153
I mean, if there are agents
out there, what is it?

01:40:36.155 --> 01:40:38.957
Because you're gonna need
live hostages to negotiate with.

01:40:40.959 --> 01:40:41.993
I'm just sayin'.

01:40:59.677 --> 01:41:03.279
Grace, I need some wire.
I can open this lock.

01:41:09.786 --> 01:41:11.819
Stay still, sweetie.

01:41:11.821 --> 01:41:12.856
Woo!

01:41:17.527 --> 01:41:20.563
Meth, I told you to call me
every five minutes.

01:41:21.065 --> 01:41:22.866
All right? Check in with me.

01:41:47.023 --> 01:41:48.488
<i>Meth, I'm not fuckin' around.</i>

01:41:48.490 --> 01:41:50.357
Now call me back, goddammit!

01:41:56.531 --> 01:41:58.533
Shit! No, service.

01:41:59.034 --> 01:42:02.003
U... Useless now, Meth.

01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:16.751
We ain't got much time.

01:42:19.987 --> 01:42:23.423
What the fuck was that?

01:42:29.796 --> 01:42:31.065
Pick up that chain.

01:42:32.066 --> 01:42:33.299
Put it around your neck.

01:42:33.301 --> 01:42:35.669
We're gonna take us
a little walk.

01:42:38.306 --> 01:42:39.539
Put your hands on your head.

01:42:41.775 --> 01:42:43.944
Face that way.
Don't look at me.

01:42:44.911 --> 01:42:46.811
To your left,
go to your goddamn left.

01:42:46.813 --> 01:42:49.249
Go, right through there.
Through there, by the tree, go!

01:42:50.382 --> 01:42:52.918
See if you could...
see if you can find something.

01:43:06.333 --> 01:43:07.631
<i>Where are you guys?</i>

01:43:09.467 --> 01:43:11.770
<i>Shep! Stew!</i>

01:43:13.538 --> 01:43:15.007
Hey, what is it?

01:43:15.707 --> 01:43:17.842
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

01:43:20.179 --> 01:43:21.080
Hey!

01:43:21.614 --> 01:43:23.080
Fuck's sake!

01:43:24.682 --> 01:43:25.817
<i>What is it?</i>

01:43:31.689 --> 01:43:34.090
Oh, no.

01:43:34.092 --> 01:43:36.660
<i>Someone's gonna fuckin' die!</i>

01:43:38.395 --> 01:43:40.795
Oh, my gosh, help me.

01:43:40.797 --> 01:43:42.565
Easy does it, don't get no fast

01:43:42.567 --> 01:43:43.968
ideas now.

01:43:44.702 --> 01:43:46.202
Stop, stop, stop.

01:43:48.806 --> 01:43:50.607
Meth, Meth!

01:43:57.447 --> 01:44:00.282
What happened, what happened,
what happened, what happened?

01:44:00.284 --> 01:44:03.653
Oh, shit!

01:44:06.157 --> 01:44:07.856
It blew my fuckin' leg off.

01:44:09.259 --> 01:44:11.728
Listen, no, no, no, no!

01:44:18.868 --> 01:44:21.170
Ah, you motherfucker!

01:44:26.309 --> 01:44:27.442
Huh?

01:44:36.752 --> 01:44:37.987
Stew!

01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:49.631
Huh?

01:44:50.698 --> 01:44:52.599
I can't understand you, brother.

01:44:53.201 --> 01:44:54.103
But then again,

01:44:55.537 --> 01:44:56.771
I never could.

01:44:57.373 --> 01:44:58.771
One thing's for certain.

01:44:58.773 --> 01:45:00.675
This is your last time
fuckin' up.

01:46:04.403 --> 01:46:06.805
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:46:08.141 --> 01:46:09.075
I'm sorry.

01:46:10.476 --> 01:46:11.576
I'm sorry.

01:46:16.681 --> 01:46:17.783
I'm sorry.

01:46:45.009 --> 01:46:46.943
You motherfucker!

01:46:48.978 --> 01:46:51.746
What the fuck did you do?

01:47:04.828 --> 01:47:05.995
Yeah, come here!

01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:18.131
Come on, love.

01:48:19.866 --> 01:48:21.835
Yeah, you're okay.

01:48:24.371 --> 01:48:25.338
All right.

01:48:40.654 --> 01:48:42.421
Mr. Pratt, Chief!

01:48:42.955 --> 01:48:44.354
Quick question.

01:48:44.356 --> 01:48:46.756
You found the girl kidnapped
by coincidence?

01:48:46.758 --> 01:48:48.258
Well, um, depends

01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:50.494
if you believe in
such things as coincidence.

01:48:50.496 --> 01:48:52.462
My team always knew something
was going on.

01:48:52.464 --> 01:48:54.331
- They're the real heroes.
- Give him some room.

01:48:54.333 --> 01:48:55.832
- Not me.
- So, you're telling me

01:48:55.834 --> 01:48:57.136
this was 100 percent luck?

01:48:57.803 --> 01:49:00.003
Just luck is preparation
meets opportunity.

01:49:00.005 --> 01:49:01.438
That's what my dad always said.

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:03.041
Question, over here.

01:49:03.741 --> 01:49:05.841
<i>In breaking news, the
missing schoolgirl, Stacey Bastion,</i>

01:49:05.843 --> 01:49:07.443
<i>has been found and rescued.</i>

01:49:07.445 --> 01:49:08.978
Her suspected captors

01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:10.613
<i>are members
of a mountain militia group.</i>

01:49:10.615 --> 01:49:14.483
<i>Credited with her rescue,
is Jason "Chief" Pratt.</i>

01:49:14.485 --> 01:49:16.285
<i>Hey, Chief, Chief.</i>

01:49:16.287 --> 01:49:17.620
<i>You know, a few years ago
a guy in Cleveland</i>

01:49:17.622 --> 01:49:19.121
<i>found three kidnapped girls.</i>

01:49:19.123 --> 01:49:20.624
<i>Became a media hero.
What do you plan to do</i>

01:49:20.626 --> 01:49:22.058
<i>when you get
your five minutes of fame?</i>

01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:23.428
Uh, me, well um...

01:49:24.329 --> 01:49:26.662
share any reward money
with Stacey's family.

01:49:26.664 --> 01:49:28.197
<i>They've been through a lot.</i>

01:49:28.199 --> 01:49:29.465
<i>Chief,
do you consider yourself a hero?</i>

01:49:29.467 --> 01:49:30.999
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- <i>Mr. Pratt.</i>

01:49:31.001 --> 01:49:32.300
<i>Have you been in touch
with Stacey...</i>

01:49:32.302 --> 01:49:33.969
Because they're paying
for an exclusive

01:49:33.971 --> 01:49:34.838
doesn't mean you have
to answer everything.

01:49:35.372 --> 01:49:36.938
If they ask you a question
you don't like,

01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:38.573
just say, "Pass, bitch."

01:49:38.575 --> 01:49:40.308
Well,
congratulations, first of all.

01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:44.212
You got this big book deal
and a major magazine.

01:49:44.214 --> 01:49:46.649
Just announced, they're gonna
put you on the cover

01:49:46.651 --> 01:49:48.250
<i>of their very next issue.</i>

01:49:48.252 --> 01:49:49.484
<i>Let's take a look
at that issue, that cover.</i>

01:49:49.486 --> 01:49:51.219
Lookit,
that crazy fucker's on TV!

01:49:51.221 --> 01:49:52.853
<i>That's pretty extraordinary.</i>

01:49:52.855 --> 01:49:54.489
<i>I mean, to be on the cover
of a major magazine.</i>

01:49:54.491 --> 01:49:56.023
<i>You said something
in the interview</i>

01:49:56.025 --> 01:49:57.692
<i>that got my attention.
You said that</i>

01:49:57.694 --> 01:49:59.460
<i>you actually have a handgun</i>

01:49:59.462 --> 01:50:03.030
that could kill 100 people
without ever reloading.

01:50:03.032 --> 01:50:04.964
<i>Yeah, yes, sir, the SIG556</i>

01:50:04.966 --> 01:50:08.068
<i>is classified as a pistol
because it has no butt stock.</i>

01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:10.371
<i>But you could put
a Beta C-Mag on it</i>

01:50:10.373 --> 01:50:12.473
and you'd have
a pretty sweet handgun

01:50:12.475 --> 01:50:14.541
that could fire a hundred rounds
without reloading.

01:50:14.543 --> 01:50:17.177
Man, that freaky dude
could have killed everybody.

01:50:17.179 --> 01:50:19.178
See, I told you
that motherfucker was crazy,

01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:21.482
and you're worrying about dudes
with tattoos on their face.

01:50:21.484 --> 01:50:23.316
This bastard could have killed
everybody in here.

01:50:23.318 --> 01:50:25.118
<i>...on this show is we have</i>

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:28.187
less gun control with more guns
and more gun violence

01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:29.622
<i>than any country in the world.</i>

01:50:29.624 --> 01:50:32.025
We also have more people
who are medicated

01:50:32.027 --> 01:50:33.427
for mental health issues

01:50:33.429 --> 01:50:35.261
than any other country
in the world.

01:50:35.263 --> 01:50:37.397
And I did a little bit
of research on you, sir,

01:50:37.399 --> 01:50:40.133
and it turns out you yourself
have admitted

01:50:40.135 --> 01:50:42.335
to having a long history
of mental illness.

01:50:42.337 --> 01:50:44.570
In fact,
you're on the no-fly list.

01:50:44.572 --> 01:50:46.938
<i>Uh, you are so dangerous
they won't even let you</i>

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.840
<i>on an airplane
in the United States,</i>

01:50:48.842 --> 01:50:53.545
and yet somehow you are able
to get guns in America easily

01:50:53.547 --> 01:50:55.283
and legally...
isn't that weird?

01:50:55.949 --> 01:50:57.717
Doesn't that strike you
as a little bit strange?

01:50:57.719 --> 01:51:00.085
That makes a lot of people
feel kind of uncomfortable,

01:51:00.087 --> 01:51:01.288
I would imagine, uh...

01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:03.791
No?

01:51:05.292 --> 01:51:07.494
Excuse me, sir? Uh...

01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:09.463
Mr. Pratt?

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:12.231
Mr. Pratt?

01:51:26.379 --> 01:51:27.847
<i>The world will never know...</i>

01:51:28.748 --> 01:51:30.016
<i>but we do.</i>

01:51:35.755 --> 01:51:39.856
Uh... Chief?
Chief, are you good?

01:51:39.858 --> 01:51:43.694
<i>Um, I realize that
a lot of people think</i>

01:51:43.696 --> 01:51:45.596
<i>you're some kind of, like,
a ticking time bomb.</i>

01:51:45.598 --> 01:51:48.031
Other people say, "Hey, look,
this guy is a public hero."

01:51:48.033 --> 01:51:49.501
Uh, you know, how do you see it?

01:51:52.904 --> 01:51:54.039
Chief.

01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:57.141
Hey, are you with me here?
Chief.

01:51:58.976 --> 01:52:00.111
Uh...

01:52:12.189 --> 01:52:13.324
<i>Chief...</i>

01:52:14.291 --> 01:52:17.760
Well, I guess some people
would say I'm a little crazy.

01:52:17.762 --> 01:52:20.129
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>
- Man, you is crazy.

01:52:20.131 --> 01:52:21.597
That nigga crazy as hell, man.

01:52:21.599 --> 01:52:23.297
He looked so nice
when I hired him.

01:52:23.299 --> 01:52:24.468
<i>That girl needed my help.</i>

01:52:25.468 --> 01:52:27.971
I just did for her what I hope
someone would do for me.

01:52:28.773 --> 01:52:31.740
- <i>Do unto others, you know?</i>
- <i>Hey, look, I get that.</i>

01:52:31.742 --> 01:52:33.175
<i>That's a good Bible verse,</i>

01:52:33.177 --> 01:52:34.476
<i>but there's other stuff
in the Bible,</i>

01:52:34.478 --> 01:52:35.644
like, you know,
"Thou shalt not kill."

01:52:35.646 --> 01:52:36.580
How about that?

01:52:39.082 --> 01:52:40.350
<i>All I can tell you...</i>

01:52:41.451 --> 01:52:43.153
<i>is killin' those bad guys...</i>

01:52:44.354 --> 01:52:45.722
felt like the right thing to do.

01:52:46.589 --> 01:52:48.756
How this motherfucker
know who's the bad guy?

01:52:48.758 --> 01:52:50.290
<i>You know, in the middle of a...</i>

01:52:50.292 --> 01:52:52.559
<i>big, big media hype moment,</i>

01:52:52.561 --> 01:52:55.129
you are just everywhere,
everybody's talking about you.

01:52:55.131 --> 01:52:56.831
<i>You even got people
out there sayin'</i>

01:52:56.833 --> 01:52:58.800
<i>that you should actually
be running for public office.</i>

01:52:58.802 --> 01:53:00.570
<i>How does that sound to you?</i>

01:53:01.504 --> 01:53:04.239
<i>Uh, that is what's really crazy.</i>

01:53:04.774 --> 01:53:06.807
<i>Well, I'd have a hard time</i>

01:53:06.809 --> 01:53:08.208
<i>arguing with you on that one,</i>

01:53:08.210 --> 01:53:09.576
but how are you dealing
with the attention?

01:53:09.578 --> 01:53:10.579
Honestly, how are you
dealing with it?

01:53:15.183 --> 01:53:16.949
<i>I guess we're all born

01:53:16.951 --> 01:53:18.120

01:53:18.754 --> 01:53:19.788
<i>And, uh...</i>

01:53:20.756 --> 01:53:22.624
<i>sometimes we settle
for attention.</i>

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.160
<i>Hm, you know, that's actually</i>

01:53:28.162 --> 01:53:29.962
<i>a pretty profound statement,
sir.</i>

01:53:29.964 --> 01:53:33.234
<i>We look for love,
but we settle for attention.</i>

01:53:33.734 --> 01:53:36.036
That's coming to you
from Mr. Jason Pratt.

01:53:36.604 --> 01:53:39.306
According to him,
he's one of the good guys.

01:53:40.842 --> 01:53:41.844
<i>At first,</i>

01:53:42.477 --> 01:53:45.446
<i>all the attention caught me
by surprise.</i>

01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:47.882
<i>But in no time at all,</i>

01:53:48.449 --> 01:53:50.716
<i>I was a complete media whore.</i>

01:53:50.718 --> 01:53:52.083

01:53:52.085 --> 01:53:53.719
No, no, this is a great call.

01:53:53.721 --> 01:53:55.420
Oh, my God,
you have to see this.

01:53:55.422 --> 01:53:56.790

01:53:57.591 --> 01:53:59.224
