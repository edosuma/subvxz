.

00:02.136 --> 00:05.406
[indistinct chatter]

00:05.439 --> 00:07.308
- Thank God that's over.

00:07.341 --> 00:10.411
I mean, how many encores
can one person do?

00:11.379 --> 00:12.413
- [sighs]

00:12.446 --> 00:14.082
- [chuckles]

00:14.115 --> 00:16.084
So, what, you avoiding
going home already?

00:16.117 --> 00:18.352
- What?

00:18.386 --> 00:21.055
Dude, I'm working overtime so
we can pay off my place faster.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.590
- It's your place.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.392
- Our place.
- Uh-huh.

00:24.425 --> 00:25.526
- It's been four days.

00:25.559 --> 00:29.530
- Well, still.

00:29.563 --> 00:30.531
- What?
- Nothing.

00:30.564 --> 00:34.568
- I'm not avoiding
going home, I...

00:34.602 --> 00:36.270
You know, out of
all of my friends,

00:36.304 --> 00:38.606
I am not going to take
relationship insight from you.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.608
- No, no, no. What? No, see--
- No.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.543
- Erin, you don't want to
get punched in the face,

00:42.576 --> 00:45.413
you got to talk to the guy
with the broken schnoz.

00:45.446 --> 00:46.514
- Okay.
- You know.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.449
- Sure.
- I'm just lookin' out for ya.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.517
That's all.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.552
You can learn
from my mistakes.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.554
I just think you and Halstead
should have a plan.

00:53.587 --> 00:57.425
- Dude, you and Burgess
had the ultimate plan.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.194
What happened?

01:00.228 --> 01:02.430
- That's a fair enough point.

01:02.463 --> 01:05.666
[gunfire, screaming]

01:05.699 --> 01:07.268
- Go, go!

01:07.301 --> 01:08.302
[panicked shouting]

01:08.336 --> 01:10.204
[gunshot]

01:10.238 --> 01:11.239
Get down!

01:11.272 --> 01:14.575
[indistinct shouting]

01:14.608 --> 01:16.444
Police! Get down!
- Everybody down!

01:16.477 --> 01:18.846
Down! Everybody down!
- Everybody, get down!

01:18.879 --> 01:21.882
Get down!
- Get down, get down!

01:21.915 --> 01:24.252
- Get down! Stay down!
[gunshot]

01:24.285 --> 01:27.655
- Get down!
[gunfire]

01:27.688 --> 01:29.157
Get down!
[screaming]

01:29.190 --> 01:31.125
Get down!
[gunshot]

01:31.159 --> 01:34.128
[indistinct shouting]

01:34.162 --> 01:36.130
- I don't have a shot!

01:36.164 --> 01:37.431
[tires squealing]

01:39.533 --> 01:41.869
Lincoln 5021, we have
shots fired at the Riviera.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.572
Offender in a black SUV,
fleeing southbound on Broadway.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.340
Roll ambulances
to our location.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.676
4698 North Broadway.

01:48.709 --> 01:49.743
We have multiple victims.

01:49.777 --> 01:53.281
Gunshot wounds, struck
by vehicle--we need help!

01:56.517 --> 02:00.321
[sirens wailing]

02:00.354 --> 02:02.423
[indistinct chatter]

02:04.525 --> 02:07.361
- Uh, let's set up the
command post here on Broadway,

02:07.395 --> 02:09.930
staging center for victims
off of Lawrence.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.266
Hey--no one leaves,
you understand?

02:12.300 --> 02:13.667
Get a statement
from everyone.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.269
- Copy that.
- Single car.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.304
- Yeah.
- Driver was the only shooter.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.372
He opened up on the crowd
from inside the vehicle.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.641
- Yeah, we got multiple people
shot, multiple people run down.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.610
This guy, he drove
right through the crowd.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.477
It looked like Nice, boss.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.446
- Well, until we know
what this is,

02:25.479 --> 02:27.248
I'm initiating
a plan three.

02:27.281 --> 02:31.252
Get a street deputy down here,
notify ICE, Homeland, FBI.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.954
Kevin, I want you to clear
this entire crime scene.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.689
Only medics.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.493
- Okay, let's go.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.262
I need everybody
off the streets.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.397
I need you to gather everybody
past Lawrence for me.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.465
Is she hurt?
- No.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.667
- No? Okay, can you follow
those officers for me?

02:46.700 --> 02:48.702
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.440
- [wincing]

02:54.408 --> 02:56.444
[groaning]

02:59.313 --> 03:01.349
- [grunts]

03:03.351 --> 03:05.219
Hey, hey.
Hey, no, no, no, don't move.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.487
Don't move, don't move,
don't move.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.389
I'm the police.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.990
I'm the police--
you gonna be okay.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.292
All right, all right.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.493
Okay, I got you.
I got you.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.495
I need some help over here!

03:14.528 --> 03:16.230
Hey, hey, hey.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.565
I'm on the job!
Get me a medic!

03:17.598 --> 03:19.967
I need a medic right now!

03:20.000 --> 03:22.503
- [groans]

03:22.536 --> 03:23.704
Please...

03:23.737 --> 03:26.006
not like--
not like this.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.575
- Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.643
It's not gonna be like this.
Okay?

03:29.677 --> 03:31.612
It's not gonna be like this.
I got you.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.980
I got you, okay?

03:33.013 --> 03:34.615
Look at me, look at me,
open your eyes.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.717
Look at me.
Right? Okay?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.819
Stay right here, look--
look at me, look at me.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.388
Look at me!
Look at me.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.356
Huh?
I'm right here, okay?

03:42.390 --> 03:43.457
Let's keep it right here.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.825
Let's keep it right here,
little homey.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.627
You got it, okay?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.429
Stay strong,
little homey, come on.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.497
Come on, man.

03:57.505 --> 04:00.040
- We got six injuries, two
clipped by the van, four shot.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.876
All non-life-threatening,
except the boy in the alley.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.878
- The kid was one of
the rappers performing.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.281
Took two shots,
center mass.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.482
- Shooter knew
what he was doing, too.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.884
I mean, he knew exactly when
the concert was getting out.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.952
- Hey, what you got?

04:11.985 --> 04:14.288
- Witnesses say the shooter
was parked at the curb,

04:14.322 --> 04:15.789
he opened fire near
the side entrance,

04:15.823 --> 04:16.690
then drove into the crowd.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.858
- You got a description yet?
- Nothing.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.694
People were running,
there was rapid fire,

04:20.728 --> 04:21.894
a muzzle flash--
no one could see.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.697
- Anyone heard
the offender say anything?

04:23.731 --> 04:24.765
Pledge any allegiance?

04:24.798 --> 04:26.033
- Didn't say a word,
just fired.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.668
- Now, we've got
a score of witnesses

04:27.701 --> 04:29.002
saying the shooter was masked,

04:29.036 --> 04:31.305
but just as many
insisting he was Muslim.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.307
- All right, you run command
and activate pinpoint.

04:33.341 --> 04:34.241
We'll run parallel.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.776
Guy's still out there;
we need to worry about

04:35.809 --> 04:36.644
a secondary attack.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.346
- How long before
a terrorist group

04:38.379 --> 04:39.713
would claim something
like this?

04:39.747 --> 04:40.848
- Usually pretty fast.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.651
- Hey, Sarge.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.752
Patrol found the SUV.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.020
It was torched in a parking
garage off of Southport.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.756
- Shooter tried to
remove the VIN number,

04:48.789 --> 04:49.923
but he didn't know about
the one on the frame.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.559
- It's registered to
a Greg Penley.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.327
Guy's got a prior
for a hate crime.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.697
- How 'bout that?

04:59.833 --> 05:02.370
- TV's been on in the
living room since we got here.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.338
We've not seen anyone
in or out.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.807
- No cars in the garage.
We ran everything you asked.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.942
No one should be
in the home but Penley.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.644
- All right,
let's do this.

05:11.612 --> 05:12.613
[doorbell rings]

05:15.849 --> 05:17.951
- Good evening, sir,
we are with the Chicago PD.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.087
We've been notified that there's
a gas leak in the area.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.989
We need to evacuate
the block as a precaution.

05:22.022 --> 05:22.990
- A gas leak?

05:23.023 --> 05:24.592
- Yeah, if you just step
outside,

05:24.625 --> 05:26.093
we'll get the fire team in
and clear your home

05:26.126 --> 05:27.661
as quickly as possible.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.029
- Yeah, I need to grab
some stuff, first.

05:29.062 --> 05:32.065
- Just step outside, sir.
- Just don't--

05:32.099 --> 05:33.867
- Outside.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.836
Nice and easy.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.805
Get down on your knees.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.874
Give me those hands.
Let me see your hands.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.017
- What happened, Greg?

05:50.050 --> 05:52.052
- You tell me!

05:52.085 --> 05:54.087
- You're never getting out of
here until you come clean.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.023
And I mean, like,
never getting out.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.692
- I didn't do anything!
I've been at home.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.428
- Ten years ago, you were
convicted of assault

06:00.461 --> 06:01.429
with a deadly weapon
for smashing

06:01.462 --> 06:03.864
a Pakistani shopkeeper's
skull in

06:03.897 --> 06:05.999
with a baseball bat while
shouting racial slurs.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.134
- And I did my time for that.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.135
I was young.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.738
[yelps]

06:10.771 --> 06:13.741
- That ain't youth.
That's hate.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.410
- Call it what you want,
I'm not like that--

06:16.444 --> 06:18.646
- Then how'd your car end up
at a mass shooting?

06:18.679 --> 06:19.847
- What?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.048
I have no idea!

06:21.081 --> 06:22.716
Someone must've stolen it.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.785
- And you didn't notice,
didn't report it?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.854
- I keep it parked
in a crappy lot.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.155
On the West side.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.891
I barely use it in the city.
[choking]

06:30.924 --> 06:33.894
I use it to go up to my ma's
place, up in Michigan.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.095
I had nothing
to do with this!

06:35.128 --> 06:37.831
- I got a half a dozen people
being treated at Chicago Med,

06:37.865 --> 06:42.169
one of 'em a 16-year-old boy
who is clinging to life.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.005
So you're gonna lose
the wide-eyed act...

06:45.038 --> 06:47.174
and you're gonna get
real honest.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.176
Real fast.

06:49.209 --> 06:52.112
- I swear on my mother's life.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.482
I had a pizza delivered
around 10:00.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.685
I can give you
the name of the place.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.655
- Uh, Sarge, we got something
you need to see.

07:01.689 --> 07:04.792
- [gagging, grunts]

07:04.825 --> 07:07.060
- So CPIC said they noticed it
about 20 minutes ago.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.463
Since then,
I found 13 posts.

07:09.497 --> 07:12.500
This profile belonging to
a banger with the G Park Lords

07:12.533 --> 07:13.967
was the first.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.938
- "TK Ice, bitch thought he
tough, but we SHK.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.674
"G Park Lords gun
that punk down.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.075
"That's right,
we get to you anywhere,

07:22.109 --> 07:23.110
"even when you think you made.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.211
Bang bang, bitch."

07:24.244 --> 07:27.147
- TK Ice is the 16-year-old
victim from the alley.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.882
His real name is
Terrel Kenton.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.718
He's a rapper
from the South Side.

07:30.751 --> 07:33.086
His lyrics are violent,
but he's got a clean record.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.221
- I mean, the kid's from
Englewood,

07:34.254 --> 07:36.824
so even with no priors,
a rapper from that neighborhood

07:36.857 --> 07:38.859
is definitely connected to
the Southside Hustlers.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.260
I mean, everything
runs through the gang.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.863
Everything from the manager,
to the label, to the artist...

07:42.896 --> 07:44.832
- So if he was our target,
this whole thing--

07:44.865 --> 07:46.834
the multiple casualties,
fleeing into the crowd--

07:46.867 --> 07:49.102
- Wait, so we're saying a banger
drove all the way to a concert

07:49.136 --> 07:51.739
on the North side,
shot up a whole crowd of people,

07:51.772 --> 07:53.173
just to get to
some 16-year-old rapper?

07:53.206 --> 07:54.842
- They were looking to
send a message.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.510
Even if this kid's not a banger,

07:56.544 --> 07:58.078
that hit's a pretty big
show of muscle.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.279
- I'm gonna have the gang unit
send us

07:59.312 --> 08:01.749
all the territorial conflicts.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.251
- All right, somebody build me
a profile on this kid okay?

08:04.284 --> 08:06.186
- What do you want to do with
the owner of the SUV?

08:06.219 --> 08:08.756
- Check his alibi,
corroborate the stolen car.

08:08.789 --> 08:09.990
If it syncs, kick him.
- Got it.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.092
Guys, we got a shooting
in G Park territory.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.861
We got more bodies.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.996
- All right, run this whole
thing down with the FBI.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.931
We might not be
looking at terrorism.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.499
This could be a gang war.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:29.042 --> 08:30.143
Hey.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.746
- Homicide thinks this is
retaliation for TK's shooting.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.883
Now, the shooters came
from that gangway.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.150
And they just opened fire.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.818
This one was shot
in the back first.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.053
- Hmm.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.922
- His buddy had enough time
to grab his weapon,

08:41.955 --> 08:44.291
but he didn't get a shot off.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.293
And the woman
across the way...

08:46.326 --> 08:49.529
was just returning from work.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.904
- This guy
doesn't have any ink.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.305
He was ID'd as G Park Lords?

08:58.338 --> 09:00.107
- Loosely--I mean,
he lives up the block,

09:00.140 --> 09:02.109
but gang unit says he wasn't
a heavy hitter.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.878
- That's a lot of rounds.
- Yeah.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.246
20 slugs in the tree.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.616
- See, I don't think these guys
had anything to do

09:08.649 --> 09:10.183
with shooting TK.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.253
Whoever did this
just wanted bodies.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.933
- Hey.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.868
Any witnesses?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.269
- Neighbors said it was
too dark to see.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.905
Everyone on the block
was sleeping.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.874
Woke up to gunfire.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.944
Damage was done by
an assault rifle.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.086
I've seen too much of this.

09:46.119 --> 09:49.122
- [child crying]

09:57.330 --> 09:59.366
- G Park Lords are here.

10:01.434 --> 10:05.906
Sarge, this can go sideways
six ways till sundown.

10:08.308 --> 10:11.344
- Yeah.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.018
- Sarge.
- Yeah?

10:18.051 --> 10:19.987
- You're not gonna
believe this.

10:20.020 --> 10:24.257
Video was posted live,
just got shared.

10:24.291 --> 10:28.095
[gunfire, screams]

10:28.128 --> 10:31.164
[gunfire continues]

10:36.403 --> 10:39.639
[gunfire continues]

10:55.388 --> 10:57.958
- Area central's gang
enforcement tracked the video,

10:57.991 --> 10:59.793
picked up the two
Southside Hustlers responsible.

10:59.827 --> 11:00.994
Still had the guns on them.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.295
- Both of 'em lawyered up

11:02.329 --> 11:03.697
just as soon as they got
the cuffs on 'em

11:03.731 --> 11:04.998
and neither one of 'em
is saying a word.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.466
- All right, so what's
the traction on the video?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.736
- 84 posts so far, and they're
all direct call outs.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.870
Direct threats.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.906
- So this is a gang war now.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.474
All right, bring in
someone from CPIC,

11:14.507 --> 11:15.876
we got to track this
in real time.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.444
Every one of those posts
could be a hit.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.747
- All right,
this is TK's manager.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.849
Mark Cains, aka "Markey."

11:21.882 --> 11:23.383
Now, Markey's
a Southside heavyweight.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.485
Since TK signed with him,
the kid's been picked up

11:25.518 --> 11:26.754
by patrol three times.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.890
He always skates off, but the
arrest records are who's who.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.124
- Big friends,
big enemies.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.727
- All right, so far, it looks
like the gunners are members

11:33.761 --> 11:35.796
of one of three
G Park Lord factions.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.498
Three Corner Kings,
71st Street Rollers,

11:38.531 --> 11:39.867
and the Shreveport Knights.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.268
We got to narrow it down
from there.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.770
- That area's always hot.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.437
I mean, you got
the three G Park factions

11:44.471 --> 11:46.840
and the Southside Hustlers
in a 12 block radius.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.408
- It could easily be
a retaliation

11:48.441 --> 11:50.510
for some online beef
or power struggle.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.746
- If we're looking for enemies,

11:52.780 --> 11:54.882
Markey's label is no joke.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.384
He gets talented kids
to rap about violence,

11:57.417 --> 11:58.218
brings in cash.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.053
And if TK is a rapper
for Markey,

12:00.087 --> 12:01.755
he's making more than music.

12:01.789 --> 12:02.823
He's definitely making enemies.

12:02.856 --> 12:03.991
[key tapping]

12:04.024 --> 12:05.993
- * Yeah, 'cause you
in Chiraq, bitch *

12:06.026 --> 12:07.460
* Cops they get their chin
split *

12:07.494 --> 12:10.130
* Ends meet face down
on concrete *

12:10.163 --> 12:11.799
- He's making gangsters
out of kids.

12:11.832 --> 12:12.900
- * We TK we roll up

12:12.933 --> 12:14.434
* We ghetto like bang bang
toy boy *

12:14.467 --> 12:16.469
* Welcome to Chiraq, bitch

12:16.503 --> 12:18.038
- It's a wonder he got shot.
- * Welcome to Chiraq, bitch

12:18.071 --> 12:19.773
- A victim's a victim.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.508
- All right, get all of patrol
to flood the zone.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.343
We got two priorities now.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.978
Locate TK's shooter,

12:25.012 --> 12:28.048
and keep this neighborhood
from going up in flames.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.530
- Hey, I was just calling to
check in on you all.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.799
Uh...

12:45.833 --> 12:49.803
Something popping off
at work, so...

12:49.837 --> 12:51.839
I'm gonna need you
to call me.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.508
Call me as soon as you can.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.480
[knocks lightly]

13:00.513 --> 13:02.049
- Hi.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.484
You're, uh, you're
Jenny Barcles from CPIC?

13:04.517 --> 13:06.820
- Yup.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.188
Was I supposed to
tell someone I was here?

13:08.221 --> 13:09.857
- Uh, just me, yeah.

13:09.890 --> 13:13.360
- Okay, so you're who
I should talk to?

13:13.393 --> 13:14.527
- Yeah.

13:14.561 --> 13:18.031
- I've narrowed down likely
next targets and shooters.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.599
It should be printing.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.935
- Okay, so this is
the strategic subject list?

13:21.969 --> 13:24.204
- No, I'm not
printing you that list.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.506
How do people always
think data is king?

13:26.539 --> 13:29.877
Predictive analytics is only as
good as the person reading it.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.144
That's your copy.
What's your name?

13:31.178 --> 13:32.112
- Um, Adam.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.381
- Adam, can I eat
the food in the fridge?

13:34.414 --> 13:36.183
- Sure, if you're hungry.
Yeah, sure.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.384
Sure.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.954
Uh, there's 22 names
on this list.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.423
- Well, it's easier to narrow
once more bodies drop,

13:43.456 --> 13:45.625
but the point's to prevent
that from happening.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.997
We slim it, predict it--
who, where, when.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.431
- Okay.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.069
- A list?
- Yes, ma'am.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.138
Your son's been identified
by the CPD

13:58.171 --> 14:00.941
as a potential suspect
in future gang violence.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.409
- You saying
he's done something?

14:02.442 --> 14:03.376
- No, not yet.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.079
- 'Cause it sounds like
you're accusing him.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.181
- We believe
he's likely to commit

14:08.215 --> 14:10.550
or have violence
committed against him

14:10.583 --> 14:12.152
in the very near future.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.421
- We got boys dying
on these streets,

14:14.454 --> 14:16.056
and you all here,
asking me questions?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.991
- We would like to relocate
both you and your son.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.459
CPD will move you
for a few nights--

14:19.492 --> 14:21.561
- No, no, no,
y'all got to leave.

14:21.594 --> 14:22.662
- I can take care of myself.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.265
- Were you not online
posting threats?

14:25.298 --> 14:28.568
Yeah, you could get killed.
That's why we're here.

14:28.601 --> 14:29.970
Jordan?

14:30.003 --> 14:31.905
What're you doing here?

14:31.939 --> 14:34.975
Hey!
Uh-uh.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.576
You're coming with me.
- What're you doing?

14:36.609 --> 14:38.178
You can't take--
- Yes I can. Tell her.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.913
- It's fine.
I know her.

14:43.516 --> 14:44.517
- I don't understand.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.954
We thought this was
some kind of terrorist attack.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.289
How could our boy
be involved in this?

14:49.322 --> 14:53.994
- We have reason to believe
that TK was actually the target.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.964
Do you know anyone that
he was having problems with?

14:56.997 --> 14:58.298
- No.
No.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.600
- Anybody that he was
beefing with online,

15:00.633 --> 15:03.103
or--or calling out
in his music?

15:03.136 --> 15:04.571
- No, I--

15:04.604 --> 15:07.074
I'm sorry, I don't listen
to his music.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.076
- Ma'am, do you know how long
your son's been a member

15:09.109 --> 15:12.079
of the Southside Hustlers?

15:12.112 --> 15:14.481
- That's what you want from me?

15:14.514 --> 15:16.716
- We already have three people
that are dead.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.551
- My son is a good boy.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.988
Those people are his friends.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.090
- They're also members of
a violent street gang.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.193
- He's a child!

15:26.226 --> 15:28.661
- An hour ago...

15:28.695 --> 15:31.531
I thought you would
find his shooter.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.301
Now I know you won't.

15:34.334 --> 15:37.237
This is the South side
of Chicago.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.140
Murder's always free here.
- Sir--

15:46.746 --> 15:48.148
- So nothing, huh?

15:48.181 --> 15:50.317
- No, sir.
- Okay.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.418
So let me get this straight.

15:51.451 --> 15:55.122
TK, who is your artist,
was walking out of the venue

15:55.155 --> 15:57.224
into two vehicles
that you had waiting on him

15:57.257 --> 15:58.658
and you weren't
anywhere to be found.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.260
What were you doing--
catching a cab?

16:00.293 --> 16:02.996
Taking a bus home, what?
- I was at the merch table.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.097
Checking receipts.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.298
- And you haven't
heard anything?

16:05.332 --> 16:06.566
Not even on the streets?

16:06.599 --> 16:08.568
- Like I said
to all your other guys,

16:08.601 --> 16:12.005
I don't know nothing.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.574
- Okay, well, I know
who you are, Markey.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.177
And I understand that you might
try to handle this on your own,

16:17.210 --> 16:19.579
but I guarantee you
we'll do a better job, dog.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.114
- I got nothing else to say.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.083
We done?

16:23.116 --> 16:25.152
- Yeah, for now.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.155
[sighs]

16:30.390 --> 16:31.358
- Anything?

16:31.391 --> 16:33.293
- No, man,
it's been, like,

16:33.326 --> 16:35.562
a stretch of 11 open homicides
in that neighborhood

16:35.595 --> 16:36.796
over the past month.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.066
I don't think anybody's
saying anything.

16:44.804 --> 16:45.805
- This is totally unnecessary!

16:45.838 --> 16:48.108
I wasn't even doing anything,
you can't do this--

16:48.141 --> 16:50.210
- Shut up!
It's enough.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.112
After everything your brother's
done for you,

16:52.145 --> 16:54.114
everything Kevin sacrificed,
I find you,

16:54.147 --> 16:56.383
while I'm on the job,
hanging with those boys?

16:56.416 --> 16:58.118
All you should be saying
to me right now is

16:58.151 --> 16:59.719
"I'm sorry, I screwed up."

16:59.752 --> 17:02.589
- Okay!

17:02.622 --> 17:05.092
- Hey, Jordan.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.425
You shouldn't
be out there, okay?

17:06.459 --> 17:08.194
It's not who you are.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.097
- All right.
I'm sorry.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.444
- Yeah, that was TK
two years ago.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.713
He won the school
talent show.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.681
Then Markey got
ahold of him.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.582
- Huh.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.085
Just a good kid
in with the wrong people.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.086
- Hey, boss.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.454
We got something.
- Tell me.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.089
- Take it away there, Jenny.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.190
- Uh, yeah, uh, so--

17:37.224 --> 17:39.226
so, bangers use a certain
syntax,

17:39.259 --> 17:42.195
language--mostly letters,
a shorthand.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.364
Certain bangers
have certain voices.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.367
Makes it easy for us to track
them over multiple profiles.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.303
But there were some that popped
up right after TK's shooting.

17:50.337 --> 17:54.641
We noticed a few I didn't
recognize, and, uh--

17:54.674 --> 17:56.709
you're Voight?

17:56.743 --> 17:58.878
Hank Voight?
- Correct.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.780
- I worked in
the Ivory Tower for a spell.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.815
I've read a lot of files on you,
I guess you'd say--

18:02.849 --> 18:06.119
a lot of allegations.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.220
- Huh.

18:07.254 --> 18:10.390
- Okay, um--we, uh,
tracked the first two profiles

18:10.423 --> 18:12.259
to post after TK's shooting.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.826
Uh, they've also been
the most dominant.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.262
One belongs to a G Park Lord,

18:15.295 --> 18:16.896
the other to
a Southside Hustler.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.798
Jenny here tracked down
the IP address

18:18.831 --> 18:19.899
and they match.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.869
Two opposing gangs making posts
from the same place.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.804
So that means that
one person started this

18:24.837 --> 18:25.872
and is stoking the others.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.408
- So we got somebody
purposefully fueling a gang war?

18:28.441 --> 18:31.744
- Last inflammatory post
was made from an IP address

18:31.778 --> 18:33.480
belonging to Charles Backer.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.682
He's a black male,
mid-40s.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.849
- History of gang violence?

18:36.883 --> 18:37.984
- He grew up in Englewood.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.820
- All right, get an LKA,
have Antonio and Olinsky hit it.

18:40.853 --> 18:44.191
- Got it.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.259
They're all true.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.960
- Got something.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.829
- Chicago PD!
- [shrieks]

19:29.636 --> 19:31.404
and I needed a cheap place
to rent.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.739
He hasn't been by at all,
I swear.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.274
I just mail a check.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.408
- What about you guys?

19:35.442 --> 19:36.509
You're her roommates?

19:36.543 --> 19:37.810
- I'm her boyfriend.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.879
- I'm nobody.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.415
- We're gonna need a little bit
more than that.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.550
- Really?

19:43.583 --> 19:45.585
Look, I don't know what you
think you saw,

19:45.618 --> 19:47.420
but just so you know,
nothing was happening

19:47.454 --> 19:51.324
between me and him.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.559
- Who has the keys?

19:52.592 --> 19:53.560
- Just me.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.695
I'm not an idiot--I don't go
handing my keys out.

19:55.728 --> 19:56.696
- Of course not.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.666
- By the way, this was
completely consensual.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.468
- By the way,
we don't care.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.702
- What about your internet?

20:02.735 --> 20:04.637
You share the Wi-Fi
with the neighbors?

20:04.671 --> 20:06.939
- Really?
Can you even do that?

20:06.973 --> 20:10.610
No, it's just us.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.579
- Tenants' phones
and computers check out,

20:12.612 --> 20:14.847
but this house has been rented
out 10 different times

20:14.881 --> 20:16.316
in the last four years,

20:16.349 --> 20:17.550
which means
a hundred different people

20:17.584 --> 20:19.686
could have used it
and got the Wi-Fi password.

20:19.719 --> 20:24.624
So, best guess is, whoever's
making the posts is mobile.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.627
Drives up, makes the post,
rolls out.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.762
And there's no traffic cameras
on this street.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.899
- No, whoever's behind this
wants to keep bodies dropping,

20:32.932 --> 20:34.734
so they're gonna be back.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.637
All right, have Antonio
and Al sit on the location.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.871
- All right.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.744
- Maybe you should
work downstairs?

20:44.777 --> 20:48.615
- Yes, sir.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.650
[muttering indistinctly]

20:54.487 --> 20:57.624
- Hey, Kevin, hang back.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.791
- What's going on?

20:58.825 --> 21:00.527
- Tay.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.962
- Burgess picked up Jordan.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.631
- What do you mean
she picked up Jordan?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.433
Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.468
We were visiting potential
shooters and targets

21:08.501 --> 21:11.504
and Burgess found him
hanging out with a friend.

21:11.538 --> 21:12.572
The friend was on our list.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.775
- Kevin, TK's out of surgery.
We're heading to Med.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.848
- It's all right,
Kim's got him.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.583
- But I should--I should
probably stay--

21:23.616 --> 21:25.017
- Burgess has it.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.386
She already
cleared it with me.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.020
She's got it handled, Kevin.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.622
Go on.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.491
Go do your job.

21:31.524 --> 21:32.759
Go on.

21:43.903 --> 21:47.006
- Hey.
- Hey, I was just gonna call ya.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.876
The surgeons managed to
repair the damage internally,

21:49.909 --> 21:52.445
but he lost too much blood.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.446
It was too late.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.714
He went into DIC.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.449
- [sighs]

21:58.685 --> 21:59.919
- All right, thanks, Maggie.
- Yeah.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.621
I can have
Dr. Halstead brief you.

22:01.654 --> 22:02.822
- No, it's all right.
Thanks.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.624
- All right.
- Excuse me.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.661
- Hey, Markey, can I
lecture you for a minute, man?

22:08.695 --> 22:09.862
- Whatever, toy cop.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.565
- No, listen to me, bro--
- Keep your hands off me, man.

22:12.599 --> 22:15.602
- Bro, listen to me, man!

22:16.603 --> 22:17.837
Huh?
You gonna listen?

22:17.870 --> 22:19.939
- Kevin--
- Because I was there.

22:19.972 --> 22:22.842
When TK was dying,
I watched that scared kid

22:22.875 --> 22:25.878
bleed out next to
the trash, man.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.784
You shoved this life
down his throat.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.486
Why?

22:33.520 --> 22:35.688
To fill your pockets?

22:35.722 --> 22:36.756
- Let him go.

22:38.491 --> 22:39.526
- Huh?
This is on you!

22:39.559 --> 22:43.463
- Yeah, whatever, man.

22:43.496 --> 22:45.698
Toy cop.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.567
- Kevin.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.944
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

23:04.551 --> 23:05.752
- 2125 George.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.554
- Yeah?
- Jay...

23:07.587 --> 23:09.889
The G Park Lords
are posting up.

23:09.922 --> 23:12.024
We got a retaliation hit coming.

23:12.058 --> 23:12.892
- Where are they?

23:12.925 --> 23:17.029
- Uh, looks like
maybe 71st and Stewart.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.030
- Let's do this.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.766
[tires screeching]

23:19.799 --> 23:21.901
- Jermaine Martin is
the closest Southside Hustler.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.603
He lives off 71st and Racine.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.738
Got two cousins on the same
street a block over.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.106
All of them
could be targets.

23:29.676 --> 23:30.710
- Hold up, hold up.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.014
Gun!

23:35.047 --> 23:36.916
Move, move, move!

23:36.949 --> 23:39.952
[tires screeching]

23:40.987 --> 23:42.889
5021 George, emergency.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.691
Dark green sedan
fleeing westbound.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.759
- 10-4, we see him.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.801
- Are you all right?
- We fine.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.069
We fine.
- Can I get a mobile with 5021?

23:57.103 --> 23:58.871
- Yeah, go for 5021.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.973
- We've got two in the hood,
both armed.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.208
- Copy.

24:02.241 --> 24:05.712
Do you think they even know
who they were gonna shoot at?

24:11.851 --> 24:12.885
- You know,
back at the crime scene,

24:12.919 --> 24:16.756
when you said that you've
seen too much of this...

24:16.789 --> 24:19.826
- I was just running my mouth,
I'm fine.

24:22.895 --> 24:25.932
This could be our guy.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.776
- Latino?

24:36.809 --> 24:38.778
- Both social media profiles
are posting live.

24:38.811 --> 24:39.779
That's got to be him.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.048
Want to take him?

24:42.081 --> 24:44.116
- No.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.221
Let's tail his ass.

25:02.869 --> 25:05.738
All right, 7113.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.039
Get on the horn with HIDTA.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.007
Run the location.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.143
- Hey, this is Detective Dawson,
Intelligence.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.112
Followed a priority target
in real time.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.814
We need to de-conflict
the location.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.884
7113 Morgan Street.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.889
There's three direct conflicts
at this address for narcotics.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.156
Tied to the Latin Players.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.892
It's probably a stash house.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.026
Thanks, I'll reach out.

25:42.709 --> 25:43.943
- On your knees.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.891
Quite the left hook there,
Antonio.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.728
- Yeah.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.796
Get up.

26:06.098 --> 26:09.769
- Latin Players.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.738
There's a third gang
behind this.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.278
- Hey.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.180
- Luis Garza.

26:21.213 --> 26:24.250
Affiliated with
the Latin Players.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.788
What were you doing
posting social media

26:28.821 --> 26:32.792
from G Park Lords
and Southside profiles?

26:34.360 --> 26:36.295
Hey, listen, you want us
to talk for you?

26:36.328 --> 26:37.797
All right, that's fine.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.632
We can do that.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.133
- You know what I think?

26:41.167 --> 26:44.303
I think you saw TK.

26:44.336 --> 26:45.872
Maybe it was 'cause
he was fronting.

26:45.905 --> 26:50.276
Maybe it's 'cause he was
making something of himself.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.178
Whatever it was,

26:52.211 --> 26:57.216
you saw a kid whose death
would shatter that block.

26:57.249 --> 27:01.754
So you drove down to his
concert, and you shot him.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.189
Then you hid behind
your computer,

27:03.222 --> 27:04.190
prodding for more.

27:04.223 --> 27:09.161
- Mm, with enough bangers
shot or picked up,

27:09.195 --> 27:12.231
take over some territory.

27:12.264 --> 27:13.833
We close yet?

27:13.866 --> 27:17.336
- [scoffs] All this over
a couple of dope corners.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.105
- Mm-hmm.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.108
- Baby...

27:22.141 --> 27:25.177
I'll tell ya the problem with
letting us speak for you.

27:27.379 --> 27:30.416
We get to say how it ends.

27:30.449 --> 27:33.219
- [sighs]

27:33.252 --> 27:34.854
I didn't kill nobody.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.756
I was out with my girl
when that rapper got shot.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.692
- Oh, he was out
with his girl.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.193
- Then why were you
making those posts?

27:41.227 --> 27:43.429
- Talking trash.

27:43.462 --> 27:44.864
Being a troll ain't a crime.

27:44.897 --> 27:47.266
- Luis.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.802
You got a lot more skin
in the game than that, baby.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.705
- Oh, you can go ahead
and skip to it.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.240
- Skip to what?

27:54.273 --> 27:55.942
- The part where you uncuff me

27:55.975 --> 27:57.877
and say I swung at you.

27:59.912 --> 28:02.148
That's not gonna work,
neither.

28:08.888 --> 28:11.724
- [laughs]

28:12.892 --> 28:15.895
Oh, baby.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.800
Get where he was
with his girlfriend.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.303
[laughs]

28:25.471 --> 28:26.438
- It checks out.

28:26.472 --> 28:27.473
He was out with his girlfriend

28:27.506 --> 28:30.910
at a diner on Wabash
from 10:00 p.m. to 11:45.

28:30.943 --> 28:31.944
and she corroborates.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.212
- And two waiters.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.747
- Checking all numbers called,

28:34.781 --> 28:35.982
all historical cell sites.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.817
- All right,
I want a full profile.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.753
Arrest records, cell mates,
his family, roommates.

28:40.787 --> 28:42.755
Anybody who came within
spitting distance of him.

28:42.789 --> 28:44.924
- I tracked the serial number
off Garza's laptop.

28:44.957 --> 28:48.494
It was purchased in cash
at a pawn store in Will County.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.362
The buyer didn't match
Garza's description.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.497
The store sent this over.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.766
- Can you enhance that photo?
- No, it goes to snow.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.768
The store owner says his
receipts show that this guy

28:55.802 --> 28:58.270
bought the laptop, a video game,
a bag of chips,

28:58.304 --> 29:00.807
and a box of 223 rounds,
same used in the shooting.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.775
Guy got ID, I ran it,
came back bogus.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.877
- Why don't we put that guy
through facial recognition

29:04.911 --> 29:07.013
and cross-reference him with
Garza's known associates?

29:07.046 --> 29:09.215
- Nah, there's no time
for that.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.350
I got this.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.419
- I'll go with you, Sarge.
- No, you stay put.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.487
- Because?

29:16.923 --> 29:19.225
- 'Cause I said so.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.875
There he is.

29:35.908 --> 29:38.945
You guys give us a second?

29:41.848 --> 29:43.415
Appreciate it.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.487
What's up, Mal?

29:48.520 --> 29:49.555
- Voight.

29:49.588 --> 29:52.258
- I got this little theory
I've been working on.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.360
Feel pretty good
about it, too.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.228
See this guy?

29:56.262 --> 29:58.330
That's the kid
that shot that rapper.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.900
Started all that violence
over on 73rd.

30:00.933 --> 30:05.004
And then he hires
this guy...

30:05.037 --> 30:07.506
Luis Garza, to go online,

30:07.539 --> 30:09.341
and fire up a war
between two gangs,

30:09.375 --> 30:12.411
neither one of 'em his--
or yours, I should say.

30:15.314 --> 30:19.485
Now, Chicago PD has been
devoting a lot of resources

30:19.518 --> 30:22.554
to these two warring gangs.

30:22.588 --> 30:26.092
And they're about to be
turned on yours.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.961
We are gonna
hit your streets hard.

30:28.995 --> 30:31.297
Knock down every door.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.265
And I'm gonna personally
make sure we pay

30:33.299 --> 30:37.403
particular attention to
Stewart Street,

30:37.436 --> 30:39.538
your cousin's place off 71st,

30:39.571 --> 30:41.941
that house you put
your ma up at.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.509
Eggleston and 69th,

30:43.542 --> 30:47.279
where your girlfriend
and your child sleep.

30:47.313 --> 30:51.417
Or you can give us the name
and location

30:51.450 --> 30:53.953
of this guy.

30:53.986 --> 30:57.623
We'd cap the arrest,
no one has to know.

30:57.656 --> 31:00.426
There are families
getting killed.

31:00.459 --> 31:04.296
Hey.

31:04.330 --> 31:07.366
I got no problem
coming after yours.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.013
- That guy's small dice.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.514
Both of them are.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.616
Maybe it was
a half-cooked plan

31:24.650 --> 31:28.554
to catch a rep
and move on up...

31:28.587 --> 31:30.456
but they both had
no permission.

31:30.489 --> 31:33.492
- Uh-huh.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.129
- Name's Alex.

31:37.163 --> 31:39.631
He hangs with the boys
at the pool hall on 70.

31:39.665 --> 31:40.699
- Yeah?

31:40.732 --> 31:42.068
Now we're getting somewhere.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.103
[phone dialling]

31:55.414 --> 31:56.949
- Players run this place
off the books,

31:56.983 --> 31:58.985
so there's bound to be
plenty of bangers inside

31:59.018 --> 32:00.452
armed and high.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.388
So we don't make a sound;
no one knows we're here.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.024
- We lure Alex out on
Voight's cue; we take him.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.359
If he's not alone,
we take whoever's with him.

32:07.393 --> 32:08.360
- You two take the front.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.361
Ruzek, cover the side.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.562
Jay and I have the back.

32:31.517 --> 32:32.551
- We're set.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.754
- Copy.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.990
It's your moment.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.931
I want to see every letter
before you press send.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.137
Okay.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.007
Sent.

32:59.111 --> 33:01.013
- Eyes open,
target's been warned.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.648
Should be coming out soon.

33:18.564 --> 33:19.598
- Go.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.175
- Chicago PD--keep your mouth
shut, don't move.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.609
Stop moving!

33:42.388 --> 33:45.424
Put your hands on the car.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.064
- You got ID?

33:56.868 --> 33:58.370
- Spread your legs.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.650
- That's our guy.

34:20.292 --> 34:23.594
- Hands behind your back.

34:23.629 --> 34:26.063
- [sobs]

34:42.348 --> 34:44.250
- He's just a kid.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.235
- All right, let's go.
- Go.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.570
- I'm getting my gat back
before I go.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.373
- Shut up, just go.

35:23.522 --> 35:26.658
- I tell ya,
15 years ago,

35:26.692 --> 35:29.561
I would've played this
a lot different.

35:29.595 --> 35:31.363
I'd just work my way
up the ladder,

35:31.397 --> 35:33.632
making arrests till some
shot-caller stomped it all down

35:33.665 --> 35:37.536
to keep business rolling.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.538
Well, we're not there
anymore.

35:39.571 --> 35:42.474
- No, sir, we ain't.

35:42.508 --> 35:45.244
- I mean, now I'm just a guy
sitting in front of a computer

35:45.277 --> 35:49.681
that predicts which child's
gonna be shot next.

35:49.715 --> 35:52.618
It's a whole new thing.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.221
I'm here to tell you,
you both got played.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.756
Park Lords didn't hit TK,
someone else did,

35:57.789 --> 36:00.592
to pit you against each other.

36:00.626 --> 36:03.395
- Then who the hell did it?

36:03.429 --> 36:05.764
- You know I can't
tell you that.

36:05.797 --> 36:08.667
But I can tell you...

36:08.700 --> 36:13.305
that you played
right into their hands.

36:13.339 --> 36:17.276
Look, I know you're gonna do
what you're gonna do, but...

36:17.309 --> 36:19.245
this is your neighborhood,
this is your families

36:19.278 --> 36:22.348
getting shot up.

36:22.381 --> 36:26.452
And we got the offender,
he's in custody.

36:26.485 --> 36:29.388
So now this is
about nothing.

36:29.421 --> 36:30.689
Nothing.

36:30.722 --> 36:33.759
And that's the truth.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.669
- All right, man.

36:59.285 --> 37:01.587
- You're still here?

37:01.620 --> 37:03.289
- Yeah, I'm heading out.

37:03.322 --> 37:06.224
Just making sure
the radios are quiet.

37:07.493 --> 37:10.329
Heard Markey already jacked up
the prices on TK's music,

37:10.362 --> 37:13.299
so kid's about to be famous.

37:13.332 --> 37:16.635
- Yeah.

37:16.668 --> 37:20.406
I'll never understand it
like you do.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.474
That doesn't mean I won't
pull you from the edge

37:22.508 --> 37:25.544
when I have to.

37:28.647 --> 37:31.783
- You got to care and not care
at the same time, I guess.

37:33.485 --> 37:37.356
- That's exactly right.

37:37.389 --> 37:40.626
That's exactly right.

37:40.659 --> 37:43.362
- It's just tough
sometimes, Sarge.

37:43.395 --> 37:44.663
- Yeah.

37:49.435 --> 37:51.570
I'm glad you're in
my unit, Kevin.

38:00.412 --> 38:03.382
[dramatic music]

38:03.415 --> 38:06.385
[indistinct chatter]

38:06.418 --> 38:13.425
*

38:38.884 --> 38:40.686
- Two children were shot
this weekend

38:40.719 --> 38:43.555
as gang violence erupted
in the streets of Chicago.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.457
The latest wave
of attacks started

38:45.491 --> 38:47.393
when Chicago rapper, TK Ice,

38:47.426 --> 38:48.927
was gunned down
in a drive-by shooting--

38:48.960 --> 38:50.629
[door opens]

38:50.662 --> 38:52.564
- Hey.

38:52.598 --> 38:53.699
- Hey.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.667
I appreciate you.
- Yeah.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.903
I've always got your back.
You know that, man.

38:57.936 --> 39:01.440
- Yeah.
- Come here.

39:01.473 --> 39:04.576
- Thank you.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.745
- He's in his room.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.814
- [sighs]

39:12.150 --> 39:14.386
- Kevin.

39:15.587 --> 39:19.124
Your brother's a good kid.

39:19.157 --> 39:21.393
- Yeah, I know.

39:25.731 --> 39:28.767
[door opens and shuts]

39:31.637 --> 39:33.672
[sighs]

39:34.773 --> 39:35.607
- Bro.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.676
Kim brought Jordan home
in a squad car.

39:37.709 --> 39:38.810
She didn't have
the lights on,

39:38.844 --> 39:40.479
but I mean,
she hauled him in here.

39:40.512 --> 39:41.480
It was insane.

39:41.513 --> 39:42.948
She called him a dumbass.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.617
Hey, dumbass.
- Shut up!

39:48.520 --> 39:50.922
Look, I was just out
for two seconds.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.592
Was just gonna check on
a friend, that's it.

39:53.625 --> 39:54.593
Man, you know--

39:54.626 --> 39:57.563
you know those lists are
straight BS, anyways.

39:57.596 --> 40:01.833
Cops never get 'em right.

40:01.867 --> 40:03.669
My bad.

40:03.702 --> 40:06.505
But I swear--I swear
none of those guys

40:06.538 --> 40:09.541
were gonna go out.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.783
- [sighs]

40:17.816 --> 40:19.217
Y'all hungry?

40:19.250 --> 40:20.652
- Aren't you tired?

40:20.686 --> 40:21.887
- Nah.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.722
I think we should
get something to eat.

40:23.755 --> 40:24.956
- I could eat.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.792
- Let's eat.

40:27.959 --> 40:31.463
Let's go.

40:31.497 --> 40:33.031
Come on, hurry up.
You're hungry, right?

40:33.064 --> 40:35.634
- Yeah.
- All right then.
