WEBVTT

00:17.408 --> 00:20.107
The Italians, they want
to keep me in shackles.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.196
To them,
Harlem is a cotton field,

00:22.326 --> 00:23.632
and I'm the house nigger.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.242
How you doin'? Joe Colombo.

00:25.373 --> 00:26.809
Hey.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.811
Make up your debt to
the Families by working with me.

00:28.941 --> 00:31.292
Otherwise... the Families
will need to be paid

00:31.422 --> 00:32.771
in full by Friday.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.338
Omar.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.340
You betrayed me,

00:36.471 --> 00:38.212
you betrayed this woman,

00:38.342 --> 00:40.040
and you betrayed Islam.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.998
I lost the woman I love,

00:42.129 --> 00:44.087
the mosque I loved,

00:44.218 --> 00:45.828
and the brother
I grew up with in this faith.

00:45.958 --> 00:49.397
I just want your forgiveness
before I die.

00:49.527 --> 00:52.791
As much as I want to, I can't
spill a Black man's blood.

00:52.922 --> 00:56.143
Let Allah decide his fate.

00:56.273 --> 00:57.100
<i>With Chin up in Lewisburg,</i>

00:57.231 --> 00:58.536
<i>everything has gone to shit.</i>

00:58.667 --> 01:01.409
<i>They fuckin' got him
poppin' his own assoc--</i>

01:01.539 --> 01:03.367
You have helped throw
the Five Families

01:03.498 --> 01:04.629
into total disarray.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.283
I hope they all
kill each other.

01:06.414 --> 01:07.589
She'll fucking rat.

01:07.719 --> 01:10.070
She put her
own father away, Tommy.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.246
This is your husband
Chin's fucking problem.

01:12.376 --> 01:14.074
Why isn't he
taking care of it?

01:14.204 --> 01:16.467
You don't think that he knows
she should go?

01:18.600 --> 01:21.255
Aaah!

01:21.385 --> 01:23.300
The Reverend
was just telling me

01:23.431 --> 01:25.259
that he got government funding
for Harlem.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.261
The Negro bank
is going to receive

01:27.391 --> 01:30.481
a huge influx of cash.

01:30.612 --> 01:31.221
That's great.

01:31.352 --> 01:33.354
Hands up!

01:34.877 --> 01:37.097
Here's the money.

01:37.227 --> 01:38.707
Harlem? It's mine.

01:43.451 --> 01:47.237
We don't feel
that in 1964

01:47.368 --> 01:48.369
that we should have
to sit around and wait

01:48.499 --> 01:50.762
for some degree of civil rights.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.286
No. We want it now,

01:52.416 --> 01:54.723
or we don't think
anybody should have it.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.605
- How goes it, Kev?
- It's all good.

02:07.736 --> 02:08.737
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:08.867 --> 02:09.825
Alright.

02:09.955 --> 02:13.263
How my men been behaving?

02:13.394 --> 02:15.135
Well, they scared
the mailman a few times.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.921
The neighbors were upset.

02:19.051 --> 02:20.792
Until they realized
they now live

02:20.923 --> 02:22.664
on the safest block in Queens.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.407
Good, good.

02:26.537 --> 02:30.411
Yeah, my neighbors
are almost as grateful as I am.

02:32.674 --> 02:34.284
You know I won't be able
to protect you

02:34.415 --> 02:35.807
if you go on this foolish trip
to Africa, right?

02:35.938 --> 02:37.809
The only reason I'm going
is because I know

02:37.940 --> 02:40.682
your men will be here
to protect my family.

02:40.812 --> 02:43.728
They will. You got my word.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.122
And I'm going to want
to take Elise with me,

02:46.253 --> 02:47.471
as my secretary.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.473
She can join me
after my trip to Mecca.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.432
Elise?

02:51.562 --> 02:52.824
Can't allow that.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.478
She needs to be here,
look after Margaret.

02:54.609 --> 02:57.786
I'm sure Mayme can handle things
for a week or two.

02:57.916 --> 03:01.355
This is
an incredible opportunity.

03:01.485 --> 03:04.575
She has so much potential, Bumpy.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.577
In many ways,
she's just like you.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.797
That a compliment?

03:11.669 --> 03:16.196
My friend, the decision
should be hers, don't you think?

03:18.676 --> 03:21.331
The reason for this trip
is not foolish.

03:21.462 --> 03:24.334
It's to seek alliances
with the African Leaders.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.206
I need their help if we are
going to win our fight

03:26.336 --> 03:27.729
for freedom here at home.

03:27.859 --> 03:30.427
It's a good idea.

03:30.558 --> 03:31.863
Maybe they can lend me
a couple of men

03:31.994 --> 03:33.517
to fight off the Italians.
What do you think?

03:35.824 --> 03:39.001
Ah, I've come to realize
that you and I believe

03:39.131 --> 03:42.222
we can solve
all our problems by ourselves.

03:44.876 --> 03:45.834
We can't.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.541
Thanks for everything,
Mrs. Allen. See you Sunday.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.986
Excuse me. Mrs. Johnson.

04:08.117 --> 04:11.338
My boss would be honored with
just a few minutes of your time.

04:11.468 --> 04:14.384
And who are you?
Who's your boss?

04:14.515 --> 04:16.908
Don't worry. I assure you
you are in no danger.

04:17.039 --> 04:19.694
Leg of lamb doesn't keep well
in the heat.

04:19.824 --> 04:22.392
- I should really be going.
- We could give you a lift.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.960
You live right over
in Lenox Terrace, right?

04:25.090 --> 04:26.875
It's no trouble at all.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.579
Mrs. Johnson.

04:35.710 --> 04:39.279

How's that butcher?

06:26.037 --> 06:28.518
I hear they got the best
top round in Harlem.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.128
Would you like a drink?

06:30.259 --> 06:31.695
My husband is gonna have
something to say

06:31.826 --> 06:34.394
about you picking me up
in broad daylight.

06:34.524 --> 06:37.484
That's what I want to talk
to you about--your husband.

06:37.614 --> 06:40.704
Ain't a secret
he confides in you.

06:40.835 --> 06:43.881
I hear that you're,
uh, as we Sicilians say,

06:44.012 --> 06:45.492
his "consigliere."

06:45.622 --> 06:48.190
Hardly.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.541
I figured you
could help him see the value

06:51.672 --> 06:53.413
of the deal I'm offering.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.806
I don't have
that kind of influence.

06:55.937 --> 07:00.420
My car-parts business
made $12 million last year.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.552
I offered your husband a piece.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.859
A real piece.

07:04.989 --> 07:09.690
In return for sharing the
profits of narcotics in Harlem.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.649
I got judges.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.086
I got cops.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.698
I can keep your husband
out of jail.

07:22.703 --> 07:25.793

07:52.559 --> 07:55.866
My nerves are shot enough
as it is.

07:55.997 --> 07:58.826
The man is off the hinges, no
question, but he didn't hurt me.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.175
I don't give a fuck
if he invited you to tea.

08:00.305 --> 08:03.787
You are off-limits.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.094
You're one to talk
about limits.

08:07.704 --> 08:10.794
You hid a gun
under Margaret's piano?

08:10.925 --> 08:13.536
It ain't loaded.
But it will be.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.234
You know, maybe you
and this Colombo

08:16.365 --> 08:18.715
are more similar
than you think.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.151
A man bold enough

08:20.282 --> 08:21.718
to yank Bumpy Johnson's wife
off the street

08:21.849 --> 08:23.285
isn't so different than one

08:23.415 --> 08:26.157
who's willing to rob
his own people

08:26.288 --> 08:28.943
to pay off
a debt to a white man.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.206
Yeah, I know what you did.

08:31.336 --> 08:33.948
Do you think I'm stupid?

08:34.078 --> 08:35.906
The bank won't miss a beat.

08:36.037 --> 08:37.908
It's the government's money
to begin with.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.171
They'll pay it back.

08:40.302 --> 08:43.000
They owe us anyway.
Just call it reparations.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.046
You robbed
a federal institution,

08:45.176 --> 08:47.004
plain and simple.

08:47.135 --> 08:50.965
You are sliding down
a rap sheet to hell.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.053
At least this Colombo guy
said he had enough pull

08:52.183 --> 08:53.271
to get you out of prison.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.838
And you believe
that motherfucker?

08:54.969 --> 08:56.231
Of course he said that.

08:56.361 --> 08:57.754
He would say anything
to put me in his pocket.

08:57.885 --> 09:00.061
I don't want you
in anyone's pocket.

09:00.191 --> 09:01.889
Hell, if I could put you
behind a desk, I would.

09:02.019 --> 09:04.195
It would certainly reflect
better on me and my ambitions.

09:04.326 --> 09:06.110
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

09:08.069 --> 09:11.855
Just think about it.
That is all I'm asking you.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.686
You better cool down
before you go anywhere.

09:20.429 --> 09:23.737
"The muddled whisper
of one's soul

09:23.867 --> 09:27.828
may finally be heard clearly
in the Holy Land."

09:29.699 --> 09:31.745
Or so I've been told.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.921
I'm sure Allah
will speak wonders to you

09:34.051 --> 09:35.270
while on the Hajj.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.185
What a privilege to be going.

09:37.315 --> 09:40.884
Does the idea of traveling
interest you, sister?

09:41.798 --> 09:43.844
I could pick up three languages
just riding the A-Train.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.062
I've never even been
to Brooklyn.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.284
I would love for you to come
with me to Africa--

09:49.414 --> 09:51.808
after my trip to Mecca.

09:51.939 --> 09:55.072
I'll need an executive assistant
to coordinate my affairs.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.161
Travel to Africa with you?

09:57.292 --> 09:59.729
Who better than you?

09:59.860 --> 10:01.601
We'll have to get you
a passport.

10:01.731 --> 10:04.386
You, me, and Betty in Africa.

10:04.516 --> 10:06.214
Uh, Betty will be
staying home.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.913
Is everything okay?
Does she approve of this?

10:10.044 --> 10:12.002
It was actually her idea.

10:12.133 --> 10:15.832
Mm, maybe she knows
you'll keep a close eye on me.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.882
Margaret and I
just started geography.

10:22.012 --> 10:24.275
She's doing really well.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.930
I've been homeschooling her.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.106
What better way
of teaching Margaret

10:29.237 --> 10:32.936
than visiting the places you've
been showing her on a map?

10:39.116 --> 10:40.727
That fuck did what?

10:40.857 --> 10:42.206
You got to be fucking
kidding me!

10:42.337 --> 10:43.773
Is this what
you motherfuckers are now?

10:43.904 --> 10:45.906
Snatching wives off
the goddamn sidewalk?

10:46.036 --> 10:47.951
Bumpy, we don't get women
and children involved

10:48.082 --> 10:49.257
with our fucking business.

10:49.387 --> 10:50.737
That's part of our--
Get the fuck away!

10:50.867 --> 10:52.390
Everybody, get the fuck out,
everybody!

10:52.521 --> 10:55.089
I am showing the commission
the respect to tell you

10:55.219 --> 10:57.657
in advance that I'm gonna
kill this motherfucker.

10:57.787 --> 10:59.006
Stop.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.964
Nobody's gonna kill
a fucking boss.

11:01.095 --> 11:04.402
Come on. Sit down.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.970
Do you really think we need
a fucking war right now?

11:07.101 --> 11:10.017
We've got this scumbag heeb,
fuckin' Morgenthau,

11:10.147 --> 11:12.193
with all his little toy soldiers
up our ass.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.673
Do we need this now?

11:13.803 --> 11:14.935
Till you get Colombo in line,

11:15.065 --> 11:16.893
I'm gonna assume
that the gloves are off

11:17.024 --> 11:18.155
when it comes to you guineas.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.375
Stop it.
I'm on your side.

11:20.505 --> 11:23.987
What Colombo did with your wife
is a fucking disgrace.

11:24.118 --> 11:25.772
But as wrong as it was,

11:25.902 --> 11:27.469
he never laid a hand
on your wife, Bumpy.

11:30.167 --> 11:34.084
Tommy, we've known
each other for decades.

11:34.215 --> 11:38.001
Would you allow a man
to take your wife on a ride

11:38.132 --> 11:39.699
against her will?

11:41.091 --> 11:43.180
Bumpy, I promise you,

11:43.311 --> 11:46.009
I will put the fucking
hammer down on Colombo.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.707
That's not good enough.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.187
Hey, I tell you what.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.929
7:00--you be here
Friday night.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.323
You, me, and the Family heads
right here,

11:55.453 --> 11:57.238
and we'll straighten
this whole Harlem thing out.

11:57.368 --> 11:58.935
That's better.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.807
But if he takes
the gloves off,

12:00.937 --> 12:02.896
you've all taken
the gloves off,

12:03.026 --> 12:04.288
and I will fight you
bare-knuckle

12:04.419 --> 12:05.942
like a motherfucker.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.915
Malcolm invited you
to Africa?

12:22.045 --> 12:23.743
I'd be his assistant.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.397
Can't believe he'd trust me
that much, like a confidant.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.312
Oh, it's an incredible opportunity,

12:28.443 --> 12:30.750
but was Betty okay with it?

12:30.880 --> 12:32.273
It was her idea
that I go with Malcolm.

12:32.403 --> 12:34.188
Pack your bags.
You two and Margaret

12:34.318 --> 12:35.885
got to go to your mother's
in South Carolina.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.018
- What are you talking about?
- South Carolina?

12:38.148 --> 12:39.933
I got a feeling that me
and the Italians--

12:40.063 --> 12:41.369
we're about to go to war.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.023
What happened
to Colombo's offer?

12:43.153 --> 12:45.025
He's a loose cannon.
God knows what he'll do next.

12:45.155 --> 12:46.374
It took weeks for Margaret
to get over the riots.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.028
She just started sleeping
through the night.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.333
We are not leaving, Ellsworth.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.074
There is too much
on my plate.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.250
A man can just yanked you
off the goddamn street,

12:53.381 --> 12:55.122
and you're worried about
playing Powell's secretary?

12:55.252 --> 12:57.211
Reverend Powell and this
community are counting on me.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.386
I am staying put.

13:00.954 --> 13:05.001
Look, it's not a request, alright?

13:05.132 --> 13:09.353
Last time we went down South,
I barely slept, Margaret either.

13:09.484 --> 13:13.183
The nightmares we had.

13:13.314 --> 13:17.274
And now--now with a war,
one you could easily avoid--

13:17.405 --> 13:19.320
Alright.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.191
Elise, why don't you
take Margaret down South

13:21.322 --> 13:22.802
to Mayme's mother's?

13:22.932 --> 13:24.847
At least until things
cool off a bit, okay?

13:24.978 --> 13:26.936
Malcolm has invited Elise to
join him on his trip to Africa.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.895
Yeah, he told me.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.027
But that ain't gonna fly
right now.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.514
How much manpower we got?

13:39.644 --> 13:41.864
Fifty-five of our own, if you
including the warehouse guys.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.083
Gangs?

13:43.213 --> 13:44.475
We got the Comanches

13:44.606 --> 13:46.521
and the East Side Boys
in our pockets,

13:46.651 --> 13:50.873
plus the 12 of our best
on Malcolm X's detail.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.397
That's where
they're gonna stay.

13:53.528 --> 13:54.834
How about these other gangs?

13:54.964 --> 13:56.139
Since we couldn't deliver
on the duji,

13:56.270 --> 13:57.488
they've been buckin' us.

13:57.619 --> 13:58.968
We gettin' blowback
from the Reapers,

13:59.099 --> 14:01.275
the Savage Skulls,
and the Gulleymen.

14:01.405 --> 14:04.234
And Colombo's gonna promise them
a direct line to the duji

14:04.365 --> 14:07.194
when it gets in from Marseilles.

14:07.324 --> 14:11.502
If he gets to them,
we're fucked.

14:11.633 --> 14:12.982
Get the leaders down here.

14:13.113 --> 14:16.159
Kingston, Bone, and Gerald
from the Skulls.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.900
- I want to meet with them.
- What are you gonna do?

14:18.031 --> 14:19.902
You say they're buckin' us
because of the duji, right?

14:20.033 --> 14:22.252
Yeah.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.645
I'm gonna give them
what they want.

14:28.432 --> 14:29.477
Hey.

14:29.607 --> 14:32.306
I knew your father.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.177
Oh, yeah.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.963
The old man used to talk
about how you two were friends.

14:37.093 --> 14:39.313
Friends? He was never
my fucking friend.

14:39.443 --> 14:41.097
He was a piece of shit.

14:41.228 --> 14:43.491
He never followed
fucking orders.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.928
Eh, he was loyal
and you know it.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.061
Didn't deserve to die
the way he did.

14:48.191 --> 14:50.585
In a car with his pants
around his fucking ankles,

14:50.715 --> 14:52.413
his goomah's head in his lap?

14:52.543 --> 14:54.894
Too good of a death,
if you ask me.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.939
Tell that to my mother,
who grieves to this day.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.246
Your mother's gonna have
something else to grieve for

14:59.376 --> 15:00.943
if you're not fucking careful.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.379
See, your father--

15:02.510 --> 15:05.556
he thought he knew more
than the fucking bosses.

15:05.687 --> 15:08.211
I'm starting to see the apple
don't fall far

15:08.342 --> 15:09.560
from the fucking tree.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.345
I'm a boss now myself,
don't forget.

15:11.475 --> 15:14.348
What the fuck were you doing
with Bumpy's wife?

15:14.478 --> 15:16.176
You trying to start a war
with these niggers?

15:16.306 --> 15:17.481
I'm trying to prevent one.

15:17.612 --> 15:20.571
Stay the fuck away
from Bumpy and his wife.

15:20.702 --> 15:23.400
Otherwise, you can end up
like your father, capisce?

15:23.531 --> 15:26.055
Here I am trying
to bring you Harlem,

15:26.186 --> 15:27.665
and all you do is criticize.

15:27.796 --> 15:31.539
Colombo, I speak
for all the bosses, okay?

15:34.542 --> 15:37.588
Just so you know, it was
a friendly conversation

15:37.719 --> 15:39.068
between me and Mrs. Johnson.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.504
Did you not fucking hear me?

15:40.635 --> 15:42.376
Don't worry. I get the point.

15:45.118 --> 15:47.076
Enjoy your lunch, Tom.

15:47.207 --> 15:51.428
Just so you know,
I'm nothing like my father.

15:58.261 --> 15:59.567
Why you got us
down here, Bumpy?

15:59.697 --> 16:01.612
You'll see.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.353
Why we here, mon?

16:03.484 --> 16:05.442
Take a look.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.096
Made a deal with
the Rizzuto Family in Montreal

16:07.227 --> 16:08.968
for 300 keys.

16:09.098 --> 16:12.275
This should make up
for the mishap with the duji.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.451
Bumpy, you came through.

16:14.582 --> 16:21.023
One more thing before I front
you as much as you want.

16:21.154 --> 16:24.157
Kingston, I heard
we have a problem.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.724
Colombo promises a piece
of his next shipment--

16:26.855 --> 16:28.291
wholesale.

16:28.422 --> 16:31.294
That was before
you came through.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.514
So we're good.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.298
Long as this shit's proper.

16:37.561 --> 16:39.128
Yeah.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.564
It's proper.

16:45.395 --> 16:46.744
- Here's your duji.
- Oh, shit!

16:46.875 --> 16:48.442
What the fuck?

17:03.631 --> 17:04.806
Go back to your men.

17:04.936 --> 17:08.592
You're either with me
or you're dead.

17:21.475 --> 17:23.520
Well, it looks good.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.392
Looks like he got some sleep.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.133
Where the fuck
did you get this?

17:27.263 --> 17:28.830
Some hotshot painter
down in the village

17:28.960 --> 17:31.615
owed Chin a couple of thousand,
so he gave me this instead.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.182
Y-You think
it was worth it?

17:33.313 --> 17:35.402
No. He paid up
after I broke his nose,

17:35.532 --> 17:36.620
but I took the picture anyway.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.100
Gentlemen,
my time is limited.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.362
Eh, these Jew lawyers--

17:39.493 --> 17:40.755
they get paid by the hour,
you know?

17:40.885 --> 17:42.800
All lawyers do.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.586
Yeah, alright, uh,
give us a minute.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.244
Shut the door.

17:55.378 --> 17:58.294
Did you give Mr. Gigante
my message?

17:58.425 --> 18:02.037
Yes. Chin understands your
problem with the other bosses

18:02.168 --> 18:04.779
and your desire
to secure Harlem.

18:04.909 --> 18:08.261
So he knows that my interests
and his are the same.

18:08.391 --> 18:11.525
He indicated as such, but--

18:12.656 --> 18:14.571
But what?

18:14.702 --> 18:17.618
If he wants me to secure Harlem
and Bumpy Johnson,

18:17.748 --> 18:20.142
I'm gonna need his influence
over the other bosses.

18:20.273 --> 18:22.362
They know Harlem's
a fucking gold mine.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.842
Mr. Colombo, my understanding
is that Mr. Gigante

18:24.973 --> 18:28.672
would be willing to give you
his support under one condition.

18:30.370 --> 18:31.458
What's that?

18:31.588 --> 18:33.634
That you protect
his daughter.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.901
His daughter? Why the fuck
would she need protection?

18:45.472 --> 18:48.736
We are aware that there
is a threat to her life

18:48.866 --> 18:51.217
from one of the other Families.

18:51.347 --> 18:52.566
- Why?
- That's irrelevant.

18:52.696 --> 18:54.481
She's gone missing.

18:54.611 --> 18:57.919
You find her, keep her safe,
Chin will do what you ask.

19:01.314 --> 19:02.837
Any idea where she is?

19:02.967 --> 19:05.187
That's your job, Mr, Colombo.

19:05.318 --> 19:09.235
But the last person who saw her
was Chin's wife, Olympia.

19:13.978 --> 19:16.459
I thought it would take years
to get used to living in Philly,

19:16.590 --> 19:18.635
but it ain't that much
different than Harlem.

19:18.766 --> 19:22.291
- How so?
- Riots--we got 'em.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.772
The cops beat up a woman
not two blocks from here.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.861
Odessa Bradford.

19:26.991 --> 19:28.471
Folks started to protest,

19:28.602 --> 19:30.430
and before you know it,
the city's on fire.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.475
That's terrible.

19:32.606 --> 19:36.653
And we got the Italian mob, too,
but I'm sure you knew that.

19:36.784 --> 19:39.526
Yep, it's just like home.

19:39.656 --> 19:42.877
All the more reason why I need
to get away as soon as possible.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.358
- And go where?
- Paris.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.403
When I can scrounge up
enough money.

19:47.534 --> 19:50.493
The City of Light.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.843
But why so far away?

19:52.974 --> 19:56.369
Something horrible happened
back in Harlem.

19:56.499 --> 19:57.631
I can never go home.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.763
I gathered that,
but what is it?

20:01.722 --> 20:02.853
Please tell me, Stella.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.551
My imagination
is gonna be a lot worse

20:04.681 --> 20:06.292
than whatever it is you say.

20:08.511 --> 20:11.514
I killed a man.

20:11.645 --> 20:14.822
There was a hit out on me,
and it was self-defense.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.824
Your father did that?

20:18.565 --> 20:20.219
My stepmother.

20:21.611 --> 20:22.830
No shit.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.659
That's a nice family, huh?

20:25.789 --> 20:28.966
I thought Italians considered
family sacred or some shit.

20:29.097 --> 20:30.881
Not mine.

20:31.012 --> 20:34.189
That's why I need to get
as far away as possible,

20:34.320 --> 20:35.886
start my life over.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.540
I understand.

20:37.671 --> 20:40.630
Although, you know
what they say.

20:40.761 --> 20:44.895
Wherever you go, you bring
yourself and your past.

20:50.553 --> 20:53.252
- Is Daddy in trouble again?
- Daddy's not going anywhere.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.775
He just wants to keep you safe

20:54.905 --> 20:56.646
while he takes care
of some important business.

20:56.777 --> 20:58.518
Am I in trouble?

20:58.648 --> 21:00.955
Since when are you ever
in trouble?

21:01.085 --> 21:02.609
Your Mee-Maw said she'll have
your favorite,

21:02.739 --> 21:04.698
biscuits and gravy, waiting
for us when we get there.

21:04.828 --> 21:07.353
And they're your favorite, too.
Right, Mom?

21:08.832 --> 21:11.400
Oh, I'm not going, sweetheart.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.750
Your daddy really needs
my help this time.

21:13.881 --> 21:15.622
But you'll have Elise with you.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.276
Yeah. And we'll keep studying
the world's capitals.

21:17.406 --> 21:18.625
We'll work on Africa next.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.714
But I can help Daddy, too.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.282
Oh.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.852
We are gonna miss you terribly, Margaret,

21:28.983 --> 21:30.376
but we have
to keep you safe.

21:30.506 --> 21:31.768
Who's gonna keep <i>you</i> safe?

21:31.899 --> 21:33.509
I'll be fine.

21:36.077 --> 21:37.861
Please, Mom.

21:37.992 --> 21:40.473
Please come with us.
Mee-Maw has an extra bedroom.

21:57.054 --> 21:58.273
The guard out front said

21:58.404 --> 22:00.101
two Italian-looking
motherfuckers

22:00.231 --> 22:02.059
just dumped them
at the front gate.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.974
They fucking whacked
Bone and Stokes?

22:04.105 --> 22:07.761
Make no mistake,
we're on the edge of war.

22:07.891 --> 22:10.720
This--this is Colombo.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.288
- Why?
- He's been talking to the gangs.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.029
Kingston said so himself.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.465
Probably found out
what I did to Kingston,

22:16.596 --> 22:19.076
so he's making his own play
to intimidate.

22:19.207 --> 22:21.514
Even if we could keep
the gangs in line,

22:21.644 --> 22:23.994
we still wouldn't have a chance
against all five Families.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.127
We're losing our grip
on Central Harlem.

22:31.045 --> 22:32.612
We got to go outside.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.748
Set a meet with Jose Battle.

22:40.924 --> 22:42.491
Spanish Harlem?

22:42.622 --> 22:44.145
Jose Battle don't want nothing
to do with us,

22:44.275 --> 22:46.843
especially after you had
to knock off his boy Guapo.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.628
Besides, don't he work
with the guineas?

22:48.758 --> 22:50.151
They got a peace agreement.

22:50.281 --> 22:52.632
He probably pays a percentage
to be left alone.

22:52.762 --> 22:56.026
But he's got men.
He's got guns.

22:56.157 --> 22:58.725
He can help us change
the balance of power.

22:58.855 --> 23:01.467
Boss, is it possible
we'd be better off

23:01.597 --> 23:02.903
striking a deal
with the guineas?

23:03.033 --> 23:05.906
I mean, if Jose Battle did it,
why can't we?

23:06.036 --> 23:07.473
Just set the fucking meet.

23:11.564 --> 23:12.652
No.

23:12.782 --> 23:14.828
This cannot be true.

23:14.958 --> 23:18.092
I mean, who would want
to hurt my Stella? You tell me.

23:18.222 --> 23:22.575
Your husband believes it
was one of the other families.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.577
He doesn't know which one.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.796
For all we know, your life
could be in danger, too.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.972
Oh, my God. Are you sure?

23:29.103 --> 23:31.627
According to his lawyer.

23:31.758 --> 23:34.804
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.719
I mean, what is happening
in this world

23:36.850 --> 23:39.069
when families are not
even off-limits?

23:39.200 --> 23:41.115
Yeah, no one respects
the rules anymore, I guess.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.465
Oh, my God.
But you do, right?

23:44.684 --> 23:45.859
Of course.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.731
No, that's good.

23:48.862 --> 23:49.819
That's good.

23:49.950 --> 23:51.995
That's good. Good.

23:52.126 --> 23:54.084
I mean, this is why
I turned a blind eye

23:54.215 --> 23:55.956
to my husband's business,
you know?

23:56.086 --> 23:58.219
I never ask him
any questions,

23:58.349 --> 24:00.613
because I don't want
to know for nothing.

24:00.743 --> 24:01.701
Mm-hmm.

24:01.831 --> 24:04.225
That's how it should be.

24:04.355 --> 24:10.884
Mrs. Gigante, you have any idea
where Stella could have went?

24:11.711 --> 24:14.191
Oh, my God.
That is a good question.

24:14.322 --> 24:19.458
I mean, this kid--
she has no friends.

24:19.588 --> 24:22.069
I love her to pieces,
but she's like--

24:22.199 --> 24:24.811
She's so awkward
around people, you know?

24:24.941 --> 24:26.203
Mm.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.036
Can I see her room?

25:23.086 --> 25:25.567
Who's Delia Greene?

25:28.265 --> 25:30.877
Yeah, go ahead, you take
the corner, alright?

25:34.010 --> 25:36.056
It's like I wasn't even
in the room.

25:36.186 --> 25:37.797
In Margaret's eyes,
Mayme's still her mother.

25:37.927 --> 25:40.713
I'm just a bonus.

25:40.843 --> 25:43.193
At what point
does it switch over?

25:43.324 --> 25:45.108
Margaret's just trying
to make sense of a world

25:45.239 --> 25:46.806
that keeps changing.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.677
You have to be patient.

25:48.808 --> 25:52.333
I wish I could forgive myself
as freely as Allah forgave me.

25:52.463 --> 25:54.553
What would you do as a mother?

26:04.345 --> 26:07.653
When I sent the girls
up to Boston,

26:07.783 --> 26:11.178
I cried the moment
that bus rolled away.

26:11.308 --> 26:14.747
Then I went home
and slept for hours.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.010
I finally had a moment of peace.

26:19.969 --> 26:22.363
Sometimes, a little separation
is necessary.

26:25.845 --> 26:29.326
I think you should go to Africa.

26:29.457 --> 26:30.937
Boston is four hours away.

26:31.067 --> 26:33.896
I can't phone Margaret
from Ghana.

26:34.027 --> 26:36.943
Ghana will be breathtaking.

26:37.073 --> 26:43.166
The lush, green mountains,
the flowing rivers,

26:43.297 --> 26:47.170
all the beautiful black faces
in bright fabrics.

26:48.694 --> 26:49.956
I wish I was going.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.046
Why aren't you?

26:53.873 --> 26:56.136
I have enough to worry
about here.

26:56.266 --> 26:57.877
And Malcolm needs to focus.

26:59.400 --> 27:03.143
You'll be a great blessing--
to us both.

27:36.785 --> 27:37.743
Jose.

27:39.396 --> 27:42.399
Thanks for giving me a meet.

27:42.530 --> 27:45.315
Long time.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.753
You remember my men--
Chance, Pettigrew?

27:49.406 --> 27:51.452
A gift.

27:54.585 --> 27:58.415
I've been told that
it's a Cuban tradition

27:58.546 --> 28:01.941
to keep a horseshoe
by the door.

28:02.071 --> 28:04.030
To ward off the devil.

28:04.813 --> 28:06.685
I see you got
that covered already.

28:06.815 --> 28:09.992
I have many doors,
and there are many devils.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.994
I can always use
another one.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.300
Thank you.

28:14.388 --> 28:16.390
Government-issue M16s.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.349
It looks like they come
from the U.S. Army.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.830
It's hard to get. I'm impressed.

28:21.961 --> 28:24.006
You have a good eye.

28:24.137 --> 28:26.313
And I have friends
in high places.

28:26.443 --> 28:28.315
Come. We'll go upstairs.

28:28.445 --> 28:31.231
We talk, have coffee.

28:31.361 --> 28:33.407
You make good money,

28:33.537 --> 28:38.760
but the Italians get
the better end of the deal.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.849
Why do you care so much
about my business?

28:40.980 --> 28:42.198
I think we can
help each other.

28:42.329 --> 28:43.809
The Italians got East Harlem.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.158
I got Central.

28:45.288 --> 28:46.986
You got Spanish Harlem.

28:47.116 --> 28:48.465
But they got their fingers
in everything,

28:48.596 --> 28:50.293
all of our businesses
that we built.

28:50.424 --> 28:53.514
They leave me alone.
That's worth a percentage.

28:54.341 --> 28:57.866
What if I offered you
half of my operations?

28:57.997 --> 28:59.999
You want to be partners
with me?

29:00.129 --> 29:01.783
Equal partners.

29:01.914 --> 29:03.698
And that's something that
the Italians would never allow.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.221
You ever wonder why?

29:05.352 --> 29:07.746
Because my skin is brown,
and yours is black.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.312
And our blood is red,
just like theirs.

29:09.443 --> 29:11.358
Blood is gonna flow.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.447
There's gonna be
a war in Harlem.

29:13.577 --> 29:16.276
Over narcotics.
But this is not my war.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.191
Maybe not now,
but trust me--

29:18.321 --> 29:21.237
they'll call on you
for your men and your guns,

29:21.368 --> 29:22.935
whether you like it or not.

29:23.065 --> 29:24.327
The only war I'm interested
in fighting

29:24.458 --> 29:27.766
is the one to take back
my country, Cuba.

29:27.896 --> 29:30.377
I'd give my life to kill Castro.
I care nothing for heroin.

29:30.507 --> 29:32.771
We're both fighting to take
back our homelands.

29:32.901 --> 29:34.250
Mine is Harlem.

29:35.034 --> 29:39.255
In Cuba, we call somebody
like you an Alzado.

29:39.386 --> 29:40.822
Uh, the Cuban fighters
who died

29:40.953 --> 29:41.997
kicking out
the Spaniards, right?

29:42.128 --> 29:43.912
You're very knowledgeable.

29:44.043 --> 29:47.916
And as Alzados, together,
we'll be so strong

29:48.047 --> 29:50.527
that the Italians
won't even dare start a war.

29:50.658 --> 29:53.052
Hopefully no blood
will be spilt,

29:53.182 --> 29:55.054
and you'll be a hell
of a lot richer.

29:57.273 --> 30:00.146
It's a very tempting offer.

30:00.276 --> 30:03.932
Before I can accept, I have
to consult with my adviser.

30:13.899 --> 30:18.164
Santería is my religion.

30:18.294 --> 30:20.470
In my faith, it is customary
to consult the Orishas

30:20.601 --> 30:23.430
before making
any important decisions.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.171
Have a seat, my friend.

30:28.304 --> 30:30.829
She is asking the Orishas
for guidance

30:30.959 --> 30:32.482
regarding our union.

30:49.021 --> 30:51.980
She's saying those three have
landed with their mouths up,

30:52.111 --> 30:54.156
representing Ogunda.

30:54.287 --> 30:57.203
Ogunda we see as problems
and resolving conflicts.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.857
So this is positive,
I assume.

30:58.987 --> 31:00.336
Patience.

31:04.384 --> 31:05.951
Ogunda tetura.

31:10.129 --> 31:12.914
That's Ogunda tetura.
We see that as negative.

31:13.045 --> 31:16.048
Police. Legal issues. Problems.

31:16.178 --> 31:18.877
I've had plenty of those.
That ain't no reason to worry.

31:20.356 --> 31:21.444
Madrina.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.017
Osogbo.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.588
That...

32:18.719 --> 32:20.982
is bad energy.

32:21.113 --> 32:25.508
I'm sorry. I cannot accept your
proposal. Gracias, Madrina.

32:25.639 --> 32:28.207
You make all your business
decisions based on seashells?

32:28.337 --> 32:29.599
Only the important ones.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.558
I guess these Orishas--
they're never wrong.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.342
Listen, my brother,

32:33.473 --> 32:35.692
maybe the spirit of my friend
Guapo that you killed

32:35.823 --> 32:37.694
has entered
and influenced the outcome.

32:37.825 --> 32:41.307
Regardless, I have
to obey the shells.

32:41.437 --> 32:43.352
I'm sorry.

32:43.483 --> 32:45.441
Guapo was a snitch.

32:45.572 --> 32:47.487
The shells should have
factored that in.

33:02.763 --> 33:06.114
A white girl acting
like the help.

33:06.245 --> 33:07.594
If that don't beat all.

33:07.724 --> 33:10.292
It's the least I can do.

33:10.945 --> 33:13.034
I'll take care of it.
I want to give you something.

33:14.253 --> 33:18.474
<i>♪ The day you moved away</i>

33:18.605 --> 33:22.087
This enough for a plane ticket
to France.

33:22.217 --> 33:23.958
Delia, I can't take
your money.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.655
It's Gigante money.

33:25.786 --> 33:27.135
That crazy white boy you married
give it to me

33:27.266 --> 33:29.485
with a gun to my head.
I got plenty more.

33:29.616 --> 33:32.967
I've already taken too much
from you. I--

33:33.098 --> 33:35.143
You're all I got
left of my son.

33:35.926 --> 33:38.625
Teddy would want you
to be safe.

33:38.755 --> 33:41.323
I want you to be safe.

33:41.454 --> 33:44.631
<i>♪ Oh, what a mournful song</i>

33:44.761 --> 33:46.285
Thank you.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.637
Maybe in a different time,

33:50.767 --> 33:53.596
you could have been
my daughter-in-law.

33:53.727 --> 33:55.772
You might as well go on
and see all the things

33:55.903 --> 33:58.166
Teddy never got to see
for us both.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.995
Thank you.

34:20.928 --> 34:23.539
Stella Gigante?
Come with me.

34:23.670 --> 34:26.499
She ain't got to go nowhere
with you.

34:26.629 --> 34:29.067
I'm afraid she does.

34:45.561 --> 34:46.519
Hey.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.698
I'm not turning down
Malcolm's offer.

34:51.828 --> 34:53.221
I'm going with him
to Africa.

34:53.352 --> 34:54.831
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:54.962 --> 34:56.485
You're not going anywhere
but down south with Margaret.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.531
She's a big girl.
She can take care of herself.

34:58.661 --> 35:02.100
Africa is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity. I'm going.

35:02.230 --> 35:04.406
You and Malcolm have
lost your damn minds.

35:04.537 --> 35:06.539
I can barely keep him alive
in Queens.

35:06.669 --> 35:08.497
Now he wants to go speak
to the kings of the world,

35:08.628 --> 35:10.456
where anybody could be hiding
in the bushes?

35:10.586 --> 35:13.372
I can't protect either of you
in Africa.

35:13.502 --> 35:19.334
Africa, Harlem,
Queens, South Carolina--
anywhere I go your shit
can catch up to me.

35:19.465 --> 35:23.425
You have never kept me safe, Daddy.

35:23.556 --> 35:26.254
And you are not gonna get
in my way now pretending to.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.257
Hey! Come back here.

35:37.526 --> 35:42.618
Do you know why
I barely slept in Alcatraz?

35:42.749 --> 35:45.404
Because you were surrounded
by men who were just like you?

35:45.534 --> 35:47.710
'Cause I didn't know
what happened to you.

35:49.582 --> 35:55.501
I dreamt the worst--
raped, beaten, killed.

35:55.631 --> 35:59.548
Now I'm about to lose Harlem,
and if there's a war...

36:03.726 --> 36:06.120
I can't protect any of us.

36:06.251 --> 36:07.904
Do you see?

36:09.341 --> 36:14.607
I see you, Daddy,
all too clearly.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.570
It's okay if you hate me.

36:25.008 --> 36:27.837
As long as I keep you alive.

36:27.968 --> 36:30.579
- It's just not fair.
- I know.

36:30.710 --> 36:33.234
I'm sorry.

36:33.365 --> 36:36.803
But, please, we got
to do better for Margaret.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.848
She's both our second chance.

36:51.513 --> 36:54.864
In a small town,
word gets around fast.

36:54.995 --> 36:57.432
You must know,
growing up in Cuba.

36:57.563 --> 36:58.955
Well, Cuba's actually
a very big island,

36:59.086 --> 37:02.524
but keeping secrets is difficult
no matter where you live.

37:02.655 --> 37:05.571
Of course.
No-No disrespect.

37:05.701 --> 37:07.834
I hear Bumpy Johnson
paid you a visit.

37:07.964 --> 37:10.010
He did.

37:10.140 --> 37:11.751
No doubt to make you an offer.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.361
Am I wrong?

37:13.492 --> 37:14.580
A very generous one.

37:16.495 --> 37:17.974
What did you say?

37:18.801 --> 37:22.544
He seems to think a war is
coming to Harlem over narcotics.

37:26.548 --> 37:28.333
Here's what you need to know.

37:28.463 --> 37:31.205
I gave Bumpy Johnson
a square deal.

37:31.336 --> 37:33.468
He turned me down.

37:36.906 --> 37:39.561
He's right about something.

37:39.692 --> 37:41.911
There is gonna be a war
if he doesn't make a deal.

37:42.042 --> 37:45.567
A war in Harlem
is not good for business.

37:45.698 --> 37:48.440
It's one he can't win.

37:48.570 --> 37:52.922
Unless he tries to get someone
like you and your guns

37:53.053 --> 37:56.317
and your men on his side.

37:59.799 --> 38:01.714
Relax.

38:01.844 --> 38:03.542
I told him no.

38:08.547 --> 38:12.638
There's gonna be a sit-down
with Bumpy Johnson

38:12.768 --> 38:14.901
and the Families
tomorrow night.

38:15.031 --> 38:16.946
You should be there, too.

38:17.077 --> 38:20.385
I'll talk to the Families
about cutting you a better deal.

38:20.515 --> 38:22.082
Eh?

38:24.693 --> 38:26.521
Fuck.

38:26.652 --> 38:29.829
You Cubans really make
a great cigar.

38:33.876 --> 38:36.270
Pardon me.

38:43.538 --> 38:45.018
Madrina.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.343
Mayme said Mee-Maw's
gets cold at night,

39:05.473 --> 39:09.477
so I washed all
your warm socks and pajamas.

39:09.608 --> 39:12.480
You think it gets cold
in Ghana?

39:12.611 --> 39:14.134
I imagine it's always sunny.

39:16.919 --> 39:19.357
Kings live there.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.925
In the capital, Accra.

39:23.056 --> 39:25.101
My friend Malcolm says
that the great kings of Africa

39:25.232 --> 39:27.974
meet in Ghana to discuss
how to unify their nations.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.759
Hmm.

39:30.890 --> 39:34.023
You think if Harlem had a king,
everybody get along?

39:34.154 --> 39:36.417
Well, that's what Malcolm
wants to do.

39:36.548 --> 39:37.766
He wants to get
the African kings' advice

39:37.897 --> 39:39.942
so he can bring unity here.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.379
Malcolm sounds pretty smart.

39:41.509 --> 39:42.989
Smartest man I know.

39:44.904 --> 39:47.428
I can see why you'd want
to go with him.

39:47.559 --> 39:48.821
I'd want to go, too.

39:48.951 --> 39:50.518
I'd rather be with you

39:50.649 --> 39:52.781
than all the kings
and queens of the world.

39:52.912 --> 39:56.002
We're gonna have the best time
at Mee-Maw's.

40:00.528 --> 40:01.703
Maps are cool.

40:01.834 --> 40:04.663
You can take them anywhere.

40:04.793 --> 40:08.754
But it's not the same
as actually being there.

40:08.884 --> 40:13.541
When you're really there,
the ground remembers your feet.

40:13.672 --> 40:16.457
So I want to walk on
as many places as I can

40:16.588 --> 40:18.677
so that the whole world
will know me.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.715
Stella Gigante?

40:56.845 --> 40:59.152
No one told me
you were this beautiful.

40:59.282 --> 41:01.154
Joe Colombo,
a friend of your father's.

41:01.284 --> 41:03.765
- What do you want from me?
- I want to help you.

41:03.896 --> 41:05.637
By kidnapping me?

41:05.767 --> 41:09.075
Eh, it's only kidnapping
if you try to run away.

41:09.205 --> 41:11.469
Come on.

41:16.299 --> 41:20.913
So, until your father
can assure your safety,

41:21.043 --> 41:23.611
you'll stay under my care.

41:23.742 --> 41:25.091
My father told you this?

41:25.221 --> 41:27.833
Through Fineman, his lawyer.

41:27.963 --> 41:30.488
- What do you get out of it?
- Your father's goodwill.

41:30.618 --> 41:32.620
He's a very powerful man,
your father.

41:32.751 --> 41:34.143
And you're happy to take
advantage of his weakness

41:34.274 --> 41:35.623
while he's in jail.

41:35.754 --> 41:38.496
I want him to like me.
- And you, too.

41:38.626 --> 41:40.236
Well, if you want that,
you should let me go.

41:40.367 --> 41:42.238
I'd be a lot safer in Europe.

41:42.369 --> 41:45.111
Can't do that.

41:45.241 --> 41:46.852
You need to stay in Harlem
with me.

41:46.982 --> 41:49.942
Please, Joe.

41:50.072 --> 41:52.161
You don't understand
my family.

41:52.292 --> 41:53.989
I think I do.

41:56.209 --> 41:58.298
We don't get to pick
our parents, Stella.

42:00.213 --> 42:04.739
My father was a violent man,

42:04.870 --> 42:06.524
a drunk.

42:07.699 --> 42:10.005
He never loved me.

42:10.136 --> 42:11.703
He even tried to rat me out
to the cops

42:11.833 --> 42:14.140
for a crime he committed.

42:16.142 --> 42:19.537
I'm still paying
for his foolishness.

42:19.667 --> 42:21.626
But that's life.

42:21.756 --> 42:25.543
Why don't you tell my father
you didn't find me?

42:25.673 --> 42:27.327
I can just leave the country.

42:27.457 --> 42:29.851
But I want him to know
I found you

42:29.982 --> 42:31.853
and that
I'm keeping guards on you,

42:31.984 --> 42:33.159
giving you a place to live.

42:33.289 --> 42:34.900
You mean keeping me prisoner.

42:35.030 --> 42:36.902
No.

42:37.032 --> 42:41.167
Keeping you safe
and treating you with respect.

42:44.953 --> 42:48.696
It's very important
your father trusts me, Stella.

42:50.959 --> 42:53.658
So I'm gonna need you
to trust me, too.

43:05.191 --> 43:07.019
Somebody's favorite treat

43:07.149 --> 43:10.326
with extra cherries
and chocolate sauce.

43:10.457 --> 43:12.894
Is that a sundae
or a fruit salad?

43:13.025 --> 43:14.853
I'd like to fit in my suit
in the morning,

43:14.983 --> 43:16.724
thank you very much.

43:18.204 --> 43:20.336
Someone here wants
ice-cream soup.

43:22.077 --> 43:23.383
Need some help with that,
little one?

43:25.124 --> 43:27.126
You still full from lunch,
Margaret?

43:27.256 --> 43:28.910
Mm-hmm.

43:29.041 --> 43:31.652
She's just making room
for Mee-Maw's good cooking.

43:31.783 --> 43:33.741
We're all packed and ready
for the bus.

43:33.872 --> 43:35.961
All that good Southern food
and green grass,

43:36.091 --> 43:37.223
you're hardly gonna miss us.

43:37.353 --> 43:38.920
I am gonna miss you.

43:39.051 --> 43:41.053
And Mama.

43:41.183 --> 43:43.055
And Elise.

43:43.185 --> 43:45.231
I'm going with you, Margaret.

43:45.361 --> 43:48.147
You should go to Africa
with Malcolm.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.976
And go see all
the African kings and queens.

43:51.106 --> 43:52.281
I told you, you are way
more important to me

43:52.412 --> 43:53.761
than any of that.

43:53.892 --> 43:55.110
I'll be here
when you get back.

43:55.241 --> 43:56.982
Then you can tell me
all their secrets.

43:57.112 --> 43:58.679
You'll be safe with Malcolm.

43:58.810 --> 44:00.289
I'll be safe with Mee-Maw,

44:00.420 --> 44:02.683
and Mama and Daddy won't have
to worry about us.

44:03.641 --> 44:07.166
Worry less until you are safe
in South Carolina.

44:07.296 --> 44:09.124
We Johnsons do best
when we're together.

44:09.255 --> 44:13.041
But Johnsons are tough.
Like you, Daddy.

44:13.172 --> 44:14.782
You said we're born
with iron in our ankles

44:14.913 --> 44:16.088
and that nothing
can knock us down.

44:19.395 --> 44:22.181
I can take the bus by myself,
keep up with my schoolwork,

44:22.311 --> 44:24.705
and make my own bed.

44:24.836 --> 44:27.403
And Elise can get on a plane
and fly across the world.

44:34.933 --> 44:36.804
We're Johnsons.

44:36.935 --> 44:38.676
We can do anything.

44:40.416 --> 44:43.289
Yes, we can, sweetheart.

44:46.161 --> 44:48.990
Well, pardon me for getting
in the way of Johnsons

44:49.121 --> 44:50.383
doing Johnson things.

44:53.995 --> 44:56.215
Oh, no, there's three cherries
in there.

44:57.259 --> 44:59.348
I knew it.

44:59.479 --> 45:02.308
Every time.

45:04.136 --> 45:07.792
I can't believe Margaret's
leaving in the morning.

45:08.662 --> 45:11.099
She'll be a grown woman
before we see her again.

45:11.230 --> 45:14.320
I hate it, too.
But we got to protect her.

45:14.450 --> 45:16.148
Shit's about to explode.

45:16.278 --> 45:18.150
And whose fault is that?

45:18.585 --> 45:20.108
What are you talking about?

45:21.370 --> 45:24.373
You could consider
Colombo's offer.

45:24.504 --> 45:26.767
You could prevent
an all-out war,

45:26.898 --> 45:30.205
a war that is set up
for you to lose.

45:30.336 --> 45:33.992
My men are ready
for what's to come.

45:34.122 --> 45:37.038
You are sending them
on a suicide mission.

45:37.169 --> 45:39.867
Is that what you want?
Are you ready to die, too?

45:39.998 --> 45:41.956
Of course not.

45:42.087 --> 45:42.957
The solution's been right
in front of your face,

45:43.088 --> 45:44.393
and you keep on
running from it.

45:44.524 --> 45:47.440
- What solution is that?
- Partnership.

45:47.570 --> 45:50.225
You can't run Harlem alone, Ellsworth.

45:50.356 --> 45:52.924
You need an alliance.

45:53.054 --> 45:56.014
Someone else needs to be
fighting these battles with you.

Seashells tell you to be here?

46:54.724 --> 46:56.465
Well, well, well.
He showed up.

46:56.596 --> 46:59.294
Of course he did.
He isn't stupid.

46:59.425 --> 47:04.996
Bumpy, thank you for gracing us
with your presence.

47:05.126 --> 47:08.608
Let's put all those
unpleasantries behind us.

47:08.738 --> 47:12.220
Let's focus on our deal and
the next shipment of narcotics

47:12.351 --> 47:13.265
from Marseilles.

47:15.702 --> 47:17.008
Yeah.

47:17.138 --> 47:19.053
Hey,
a smart businessman, right?

47:19.184 --> 47:21.490
This man tried
to intimidate my wife!

47:21.621 --> 47:24.145
That can never happen again!

47:24.276 --> 47:26.234
Agree, Joe?

47:27.670 --> 47:31.152
For that, you have
my sincere apologies.

47:31.283 --> 47:34.286
Bumpy, let's talk terms.

47:36.157 --> 47:38.856
When the French dope comes in,

47:38.986 --> 47:40.988
myself and the rest
of the Families

47:41.119 --> 47:45.906
will charge Bumpy Johnson
25% of his profits

47:46.037 --> 47:48.039
for the right
to distribute in Harlem.

47:48.169 --> 47:52.217
Now, as a special favor
for our friend Jose Battle,

47:52.347 --> 47:56.612
I would suggest the Families
kick him a percentage. Say 10%.

47:56.743 --> 47:58.571
Hold on.
Colombo, wait.

47:58.701 --> 48:00.007
Wait just a second.

48:00.138 --> 48:01.400
Battle ain't in the dope.

48:01.530 --> 48:03.184
Times have changed,
Don Carlo.

48:03.315 --> 48:05.404
We need to be more magnanimous.

48:05.534 --> 48:08.146
We need Jose Battle
to keep the peace.

48:08.276 --> 48:10.583
We need Bumpy Johnson
to sell our dope in Harlem.

48:10.713 --> 48:14.326
I think the terms are fair.

48:14.456 --> 48:16.415
Are we all in agreement?

48:16.545 --> 48:18.939
The Luccheses agree.

48:19.070 --> 48:23.248
On behalf of
the Bonanno Family, yes.

48:23.378 --> 48:25.554
Gambino's a yes.

48:25.685 --> 48:28.166
I obviously speak for Chin
while he's away,

48:28.296 --> 48:31.517
so... yes.

48:32.344 --> 48:38.306
Bumpy, I think this is a very
generous deal for all of us.

48:38.437 --> 48:40.482
What do you say?

48:42.528 --> 48:45.531
I appreciate you gentlemen
sitting down to a meet.

48:47.533 --> 48:49.274
I should say yes to this deal.

48:49.404 --> 48:51.972
It's fair.

48:52.103 --> 48:55.193
And if I say no,
there'll be a war.

48:57.717 --> 48:59.197
They say a lion doesn't know
that he's caged

48:59.327 --> 49:01.068
until he's let out.

49:01.199 --> 49:02.635
I got a taste of that
on the last shipment

49:02.765 --> 49:05.464
when I was made
an equal partner.

49:05.594 --> 49:08.336
I got a taste of freedom.

49:08.467 --> 49:11.426
Now I just can't go back
into the cage.

49:11.557 --> 49:13.689
So to this deal...

49:15.474 --> 49:18.042
I respectfully say...

49:19.565 --> 49:21.088
go fuck yourselves.

49:51.423 --> 49:53.207
That was some speech
in there.

49:57.777 --> 50:00.475
Your friends ask you to come
and try to change my mind?

50:00.606 --> 50:03.304
I'd rather be friends
with an Alzado.

50:04.392 --> 50:05.959
What about the shells?

50:06.090 --> 50:07.265
Not always right.

50:07.395 --> 50:09.441
They told me to marry
my two ex-wives.

50:13.575 --> 50:14.794
Alzado?

50:16.491 --> 50:17.753
Alzado.

50:53.702 --> 50:56.488
You're built "Johnson tough,"
little one.
