we'll end up in detention?

Why have Foreman's breasts
suddenly started to droop?

02:36.574 --> 02:39.827
Large breasts are a classic symptom of
you letting Foreman take vacation days

FDA reports before the end of the year.

noticed me doing that before.

I've noticed you
a lot recently.

It's almost as if you have a sexual
interest in someone here.

02:59.597 --> 03:03.058
Well, Taub might think
I like him if I stayed,

why I'm going to do this.

really was freaked.

what to think.

that kind of present before.

I thought it would kill him.

and didn't even open it?

12:23.285 --> 12:25.912
I had no way of knowing
there was an expensive book inside.

12:26.037 --> 12:29.040
Completely meaningless
prank, even for you.

12:29.166 --> 12:33.086
Stealing your ice cream is a completely
meaningless, albeit delicious, prank.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.297
Observing my team's reactions
to unexplained phenomena

12:35.422 --> 12:36.923
could have been
pretty useful.

12:37.048 --> 12:41.887
Of all the ways to mess with people,
why give yourself an imaginary present?

12:42.012 --> 12:44.765
Have you checked the prices for firemen
strippers recently?

12:44.890 --> 12:46.141
Yes.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.269
The holidays.
They're hard for you, I get it.

12:49.728 --> 12:53.398
You see the people around you
giving and receiving gifts,

12:53.523 --> 12:56.860
having sustained, meaningful
relationships. And since you can't,

12:56.985 --> 12:58.570
something deep in your subconscious

12:58.695 --> 13:01.907
makes you create
the appearance of a gift.

13:02.532 --> 13:03.950
Sad.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.620
You really passed
your psych rotation?

13:06.745 --> 13:08.455
It's too bad you can't
just be nice to people.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.749
You could
get a real present that way.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.918
If I wanted gifts,

13:13.043 --> 13:15.962
I would just look deep
into my patient's eyes and act like you.

13:16.505 --> 13:20.050
"Oh, I'm so sorry
you're dying, Mrs. Moron.

13:20.175 --> 13:23.470
"Of course I'll sleep with you. What I
lack in skill, I can make up for in..."

13:23.595 --> 13:27.390
You'd just wind up insulting her.
Perhaps calling her Mrs. Moron.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.976
Right. 'Cause I'm physically
incapable of being polite.

13:30.101 --> 13:35.106
Being kind in a sustained,
meaningful way? No.

13:35.690 --> 13:39.152
Oh, I get it. You're trying
to get me to prove you wrong,

13:39.277 --> 13:42.405
then I'm gonna be nice to all my
patients all through the holiday season

13:42.531 --> 13:45.992
and then Mr. Potter won't steal Tiny
Tim's porridge. I'm totally on it.

13:46.117 --> 13:50.163
Yeah, that actually is
what I'm trying to do.

13:50.288 --> 13:53.583
And the pathetic part is,
it's not going to work.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.169
You're right.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.548
I gotta stop
being such a jerk.

14:03.635 --> 14:04.469
Oops

14:04.594 --> 14:06.388
Kind of undercut
myself there.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.351
(MAN CHATTERING ON TV)

14:20.360 --> 14:21.778
Janice?

14:21.903 --> 14:24.489
- I'm Remy. I'm...
- Yeah, I remember you.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.537
I heard you left the trial.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.705
Yeah.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.833
If there's some way I could help...

14:35.792 --> 14:40.130
it was that doctor. The one that was
running the test.

14:40.255 --> 14:41.798
- Dr. Foreman.
- Yeah.

14:41.923 --> 14:45.093
He's a great neurologist.
He's a great guy.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.928
(SNICKERS) You like him?

14:47.846 --> 14:49.139
Why don't you?

14:49.264 --> 14:53.810
I told him that those injections
were making me sick in my stomach,

14:53.935 --> 14:57.522
and he just
gave me antacid.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.524
We were warned that
nausea's a side effect,

14:59.649 --> 15:02.027
and giving you antacid
is all he really could do.

15:02.152 --> 15:06.823
No. He told me,
"Get over it."

15:08.825 --> 15:10.535
With or without
these drugs,

15:11.661 --> 15:14.956
I don't have a long time.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.754
I'm not gonna spend it
being his guinea pig.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.343
TAUB: House.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.386
It's tuberculosis.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.681
You got that from an anal swab?
Man, you're good.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.433
There was a more
subtle clue.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.728
Homeless guy, uncontrollably
hacking up blood.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.731
Cough's lasted two months.
He was cachectic.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.858
Unless you could
tie him to the patient...

15:41.983 --> 15:44.361
Yes, again, if only there
was some subtle clue,

15:44.486 --> 15:48.281
like the fact that he was standing
next to her in the soup line for a week.

15:48.406 --> 15:49.324
I hate spunk.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.493
TB can cause liver failure,
lung symptoms.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.661
Fits.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.080
Start her on the
standard regimen.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.123
You don't have
clinic duty today.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.668
Who says it's a duty?

16:01.920 --> 16:03.505
Hi. I'm Greg.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.006
Hi. I'm Whitney.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.509
Hi, Whitney,
how can I help you?

16:07.634 --> 16:10.095
I have a terrible headache.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.472
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

16:12.597 --> 16:16.059
We'll get you fixed up.
ls there anything else you need?

16:16.184 --> 16:18.478
Bottled water?
Coffee? Mint tea?

16:18.603 --> 16:19.854
No, but that's so nice.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.399
(CHUCKLES) Usually, the clinic
doctors are kind of rushed.

16:23.108 --> 16:25.944
If you can't be nice,
why be a doctor?

16:26.945 --> 16:29.155
So, where do you
feel the pain?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.282
- In the back of my head, here.
- Uh-huh.

16:31.408 --> 16:34.911
It's Beccaria's sign. It'll be gone
by your third trimester.

16:35.453 --> 16:36.830
Oh, I'm not in school.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.500
Neither is your fetus.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.795
Oh, God.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.088
You didn't know
you were pregnant?

16:45.213 --> 16:47.590
How do... You know that just
from the headache?

16:49.592 --> 16:50.802
How do I know?

16:51.803 --> 16:55.348
I missed my period,
I got fat and threw up.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.183
Oh, no, wait,
that's how you know.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.309
What?

16:58.435 --> 17:01.312
I know because of the tight shirt
stretched over the swollen boobs,

17:01.438 --> 17:03.606
the salt craving you
imported into the clinic,

17:03.732 --> 17:05.859
the motion sickness patch
that doesn't do anything

17:05.984 --> 17:08.028
for the kind of sickness
that you feel in the morning.

17:08.153 --> 17:11.114
I'm a virgin.
So is my fiancé.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.241
I believe him.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.410
Aren't there other ways
I could get pregnant?

17:15.535 --> 17:18.621
Like sitting on
a toilet seat?

17:18.747 --> 17:22.459
Absolutely. There would need to be a guy
sitting between you and the toilet seat,

17:22.584 --> 17:23.918
but, yes, absolutely.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.338
And I was doing so well.

17:33.344 --> 17:34.179
Natalie?

17:34.304 --> 17:35.555
(CONVULSING)

17:35.805 --> 17:37.307
Oh, God. Natalie.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.641
CUDDY: She's having a seizure.

17:38.767 --> 17:39.893
Put her on her side.
Nurse!

17:40.018 --> 17:41.728
Is this from the TB?

17:41.853 --> 17:44.230
Not with a supple neck.
I don't know what this is.

17:44.355 --> 17:45.607
Four milligrams lorazepam.

17:50.403 --> 17:56.409
Liver, lungs, and now brain,
which has mysteriously reappeared.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.038
Speaking of mysteriously
reappeared...

18:00.163 --> 18:04.334
Her ALT is 20 times normal,
transaminasas and PTs, way up.

18:04.459 --> 18:07.504
She's going to lose her liver.
We gotta get her on the transplant list.

18:07.629 --> 18:10.381
You keep showing up.
You also keep leaving.

18:10.507 --> 18:14.636
It's possible that you have the hots for
me, but really, really hate this kid.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.722
It's also remotely possible
I have that reversed.

18:17.847 --> 18:20.475
She's a nice kid,
I want to make sure she's okay.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.518
Hepatic fibrosis.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.520
Normal complement level,
normal-sized liver.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.855
She remind you of you?

18:27.023 --> 18:28.525
No, you weren't
a loser in high school.

18:28.650 --> 18:31.611
You had every Tom, Dick and Hershel
wet dreaming about you.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.656
But she could be making you think
of another helpless,

18:34.781 --> 18:36.866
chubby little girl
that you recently met.

18:36.991 --> 18:40.662
You're not really making
this about the baby I tried to adopt.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.580
HOUSE: It's been a few weeks.

18:42.705 --> 18:45.208
Just enough time
to get over hurt feelings.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.085
Natalie's 16.

18:47.210 --> 18:50.672
I think you're confusing being
maternal with being human.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.383
If we hadn't ruled out
the mushrooms...

18:53.508 --> 18:55.260
Maybe we shouldn't have.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.178
Forget toxic,
think allergic.

18:57.303 --> 19:01.015
Severe mold allergy could cause liver
failure, respiratory arrest,

19:01.141 --> 19:02.350
and encephalopathy.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.644
She ate the shrooms days ago.
There's no way she'd still be sick.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.480
Unless it also gave her
a fungal infection.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.816
Give her
a prick test and antifungals.

19:17.073 --> 19:21.161
Hey. Thank you for the gift.
I really appreciate it.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.872
I spoke to Janice.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.081
She Okay?

19:25.206 --> 19:26.249
Yeah.

19:28.501 --> 19:32.547
Her nausea, she said you
told her, like, "Get over it"?

19:32.672 --> 19:33.673
And?

19:35.049 --> 19:38.261
Nausea isn't something you can overcome
with sheer willpower.

19:39.179 --> 19:42.724
Which is why I didn't prescribe
willpower, I prescribed antacids.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.727
She can't handle that,
she'd have to leave the trial anyway.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.980
Just call her,
say you're sorry, she'll come back.

19:49.731 --> 19:50.773
No.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.734
God, you're acting
like House now.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.777
No, I'm not acting like House,

19:54.903 --> 19:56.738
which is exactly why I don't need
to apologize.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.406
I'm not being cruel,
I'm not being manipulative.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.117
You said the same thing to me when
I told you I was having a hard time.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.744
And it worked.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.455
She's a 40-year-old woman
who's falling apart,

20:05.580 --> 20:08.499
physically and emotionally.
She's dying.

20:09.250 --> 20:13.796
Look, I know seeing the Ghost
of your Christmas Future is tough,

20:13.922 --> 20:16.758
but the only way I can help her is
to make sure she follows her regimen,

20:16.883 --> 20:18.468
not by becoming
her life coach.

20:19.761 --> 20:23.223
You're not acting like House.
You are like him.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.521
Dr. House?

20:31.022 --> 20:33.024
This is my fiancé, Geoff.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.904
She says you told her you can get
pregnant from sitting on a toilet seat.

20:40.114 --> 20:43.576
I said those words, but with
a particular inflection.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.828
I knew it wasn't true.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.289
Is there any other way?
Isn't it possible?

20:49.207 --> 20:51.542
There was a reported case
of a Civil War soldier.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.169
He was shot
in the testicles,

20:53.336 --> 20:57.840
and the musket ball carried
the non-musket ball

20:57.966 --> 21:00.927
into the uterus of a woman working
in a neighboring field.

21:01.052 --> 21:03.638
Nine months later,
a miracle child was born.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.849
Also, maybe she
cheated on you.

21:07.392 --> 21:08.935
We made a promise.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.895
We do other stuff in bed.

21:11.020 --> 21:14.065
Couldn't some of his sperm
have made it up there somehow?

21:14.190 --> 21:17.443
More likely it came from the guy whose
penis made it up there somehow,

21:17.568 --> 21:20.154
but sure,
anything's possible.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.823
I want a paternity test.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.575
Tell him that amnios are dangerous
this early on in the pregnancy.

21:24.701 --> 21:26.995
- Are they?
- Who cares? He doesn't know.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.581
We'll do
the paternity test.

21:37.255 --> 21:38.965
No reaction.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.174
That's bad?

21:40.300 --> 21:42.343
If you had a mold allergy,
it would explain your symptoms.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.429
KUTNER: We'll find out
what's wrong, don't worry.

21:44.554 --> 21:47.598
And I know some things are hard to talk
about with your parents around,

21:47.724 --> 21:49.517
but kids can be really mean.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.394
There are people you
can talk to, programs...

21:51.519 --> 21:52.854
I'll be okay.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.233
You're in good spirits.
You feeling better?

21:57.358 --> 22:01.237
No. I was just
doing my homework.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.656
I'm such a dork,
I guess that cheers me up.

22:03.781 --> 22:04.741
Parents brought it?

22:04.866 --> 22:06.367
No, Simon did.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.619
The jockey kid
in your class?

22:08.745 --> 22:10.788
Yeah. He just left.

22:13.791 --> 22:14.625
(INTERCOM BEEPS)

22:14.751 --> 22:16.210
Security.

22:16.627 --> 22:18.171
I was just bringing
her homework.

22:18.296 --> 22:19.547
You helped bully this little
girl

22:19.672 --> 22:21.924
and completely refused
to accept responsibility.

22:22.050 --> 22:24.302
No way you came here out of compassion.
That only leaves guilt.

22:24.427 --> 22:25.678
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.638
Stop lying or I'll take the drugs
I found in your locker

22:27.764 --> 22:29.849
down to the cops,
you slimy little jerk.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.979
- This kid didn't do anything to you.
- This isn't about me.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.189
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it,

22:36.314 --> 22:38.316
you were bullied yourself
when you were in school.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.360
- Take it easy.
- I wasn't bullied.

22:40.485 --> 22:42.945
Right. The Indian foster kid whose
parents were shot in front of him.

22:43.071 --> 22:45.031
You were clearly
Homecoming King.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.703
Let's try this again.
Just tell me...

22:50.828 --> 22:52.663
Honestly,
you don't understand.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.291
(SIGHS)

22:56.417 --> 22:57.960
We used to be friends.

22:58.086 --> 23:01.839
And I'd be friends with her now
if people wouldn't make fun of me.

23:02.757 --> 23:04.759
There's nothing you could
tell us that'll help?

23:05.802 --> 23:08.763
Did she mention
she used to drink a lot?

23:08.888 --> 23:10.515
No. How do you know that?

23:11.682 --> 23:13.893
Look, don't tell anyone,
all right?

23:14.018 --> 23:16.479
I have my brother's ID
and I kind of supply people.

23:16.604 --> 23:19.690
I used to get her
a few bottles of vodka each week.

23:19.816 --> 23:20.983
Why'd you stop?

23:21.109 --> 23:22.110
She got her own ID.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.861
Said it was cheaper
buying it herself.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.030
You can go.

23:28.699 --> 23:32.995
I think we got our diagnosis.
Our little girl's a drunk.

23:37.875 --> 23:41.879
I don't drink.
I did back then, but...

23:42.004 --> 23:43.840
You could die.

23:43.965 --> 23:47.510
We can't get you on the transplant list
until we know why your liver is failing.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.346
Alcohol abuse
would explain that.

23:50.972 --> 23:52.557
The seizures could be
from withdrawal.

23:52.682 --> 23:55.184
I haven't drunk
in six months.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.478
I didn't even drink
that much back then.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.480
A couple
of vodka bottles a week?

24:00.148 --> 24:02.024
I didn't open half of them.

24:03.151 --> 24:08.281
I just bought them
because Simon was selling them.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.450
We used to be friends,
and that's, like, the only way

24:10.575 --> 24:12.160
I could get him
to even talk to me.

24:12.285 --> 24:15.997
Then why did you stop buying from him?
He said you got your own ID.

24:16.831 --> 24:18.166
I don't know.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.667
See, that's not
a good answer.

24:21.252 --> 24:23.546
Remember when you asked me
if I had any kids?

24:24.213 --> 24:26.466
I don't. I don't know,
maybe it has nothing to do with it,

24:26.591 --> 24:31.012
but I was good at school,
good at work, lousy at life.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.431
I screwed up every
relationship I ever had.

24:33.556 --> 24:36.100
I thought, why would I want to
bring a child into this?

24:37.351 --> 24:40.146
But then I got older and...

24:44.233 --> 24:49.280
How you feel now will pass.
Don't let it screw up your whole life.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.742
It's already screwed up.

24:55.620 --> 25:00.583
My asthma. They said they'd fix it, but
it didn't make any difference at all.

25:01.542 --> 25:05.713
Well, sometimes
doctors make mistakes, Anna,

25:05.838 --> 25:08.299
and then we have to try
twice as hard to fix them.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.550
You using your inhaler?

25:09.675 --> 25:11.552
All the time.
Go through one a week.

25:12.512 --> 25:14.639
You sure you're
using it right?

25:14.764 --> 25:16.849
Do I look like an idiot?

25:16.974 --> 25:18.017
No.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.021
Why don't you show me
how your inhaler works?

25:31.489 --> 25:32.698
Jerk.

25:36.244 --> 25:37.620
What was that all about?

25:37.745 --> 25:39.664
Jamaican chicken recipes.

25:39.789 --> 25:40.706
The parents said no
to the benzos.

25:40.831 --> 25:43.793
But I still think Natalie's
not being honest with me.

25:43.918 --> 25:46.212
So she's willing to die
to cover up some boozing?

25:46.337 --> 25:47.755
She's very depressed.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.175
She feels like she deserves what
the other kids are dishing out on her.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.677
I think she either
wants to die

25:52.802 --> 25:55.596
or she wants the attention
that dying gives her.

25:55.721 --> 25:59.684
I have no idea why you care so much.
Tell Kutner to start her on benzos.

25:59.809 --> 26:00.643
House, the parents just...

26:00.768 --> 26:02.520
Uh-uh. Not the alcoholism,

26:02.645 --> 26:05.648
the seizures, totally different.
Don't need their approval for that.

26:11.988 --> 26:13.948
You sure you want to know?

26:14.073 --> 26:16.284
If it makes it any easier,
I'm going to tell you anyway.

26:16.409 --> 26:17.660
We want to know.

Let me ask you.

26:54.739 --> 26:56.490
That patient who dropped out,
the one I told you about?

26:56.616 --> 26:57.658
Yeah.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.619
Do you think I should
pursue it more?

26:59.744 --> 27:03.664
No. Patients drop out,
that's why we start with hundreds.

27:03.789 --> 27:04.665
I just thought,

27:04.790 --> 27:06.292
if there's an easy way
to make the people who drop off

27:06.417 --> 27:07.668
come back, then why not?

27:07.793 --> 27:09.795
- They're not people.
- Really?

27:09.920 --> 27:12.923
I thought the zombie trials
were all completed during Phase Two.

27:13.049 --> 27:15.885
You can't see the patients as people.
You can't even see them as patients.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.011
They're numbers.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.220
Look.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.307
A friend of mine
has this disease.

27:21.432 --> 27:24.894
I don't want to know.
There's a reason this is double-blind.

Any personal stake
we have skews the study.

human relationships, it's about results.

28:22.827 --> 28:24.203
That's normally.

28:24.912 --> 28:29.625
Abnormally, an egg could have two
naturally occurring gene mutations

28:29.750 --> 28:31.669
that don't naturally
occur together.

28:33.879 --> 28:37.675
Spontaneous calcium spike could prep
the egg for fertilization without sperm.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.428
And a division mistake
could let the egg split up

male DNA at all.

Mommy, baby. Your daughter
has only maternal DNA.

we're going to have to
put her on a pacemaker.

29:36.692 --> 29:40.780
Alcohol withdrawal would cause
her heart to race, not crawl.

29:40.905 --> 29:42.406
There's nothing structurally
wrong with her heart.

29:42.531 --> 29:45.117

also be from liver failure.

Maybe. But it's higher
than you'd expect.

was a result of parthenogenesis.

- Human parthenogenesis? You proved...
- Yep.

32:30.908 --> 32:33.869
It's unbelievable. But I personally
checked it five times.

check it five times?

That does sound impossible
now that I think of it.

32:42.086 --> 32:45.589
I guess the better explanation is that
the paternity test showed she cheated,

32:45.714 --> 32:47.758
so I faked the whole
parthenogenesis thingy.

37:37.547 --> 37:38.715
I took care of her.

37:38.840 --> 37:39.675
I know.

37:41.218 --> 37:42.594
You found her.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.222
You saved her life.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.521
Now you have
to let her go.

37:54.064 --> 37:55.274
(GURGLING)

38:10.122 --> 38:11.748
(DOOR OPENS)

38:26.138 --> 38:27.723
Who's that?

38:27.848 --> 38:30.642
It's your daughter.
She was alive.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.645
People found her
and took care of her.

38:42.779 --> 38:44.614
(GURGLES)

38:53.915 --> 38:55.250
She's beautiful.

39:02.716 --> 39:04.051
It's okay.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.355
(INAUDIBLE)

39:35.040 --> 39:36.291
Kutner.

39:37.292 --> 39:38.585
No transplant?

39:38.710 --> 39:40.796
We appealed.
Too sick.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.631
How much time
does she have left?

39:42.756 --> 39:44.174
A couple days at most.

39:44.299 --> 39:45.675
What about the baby?

39:45.801 --> 39:47.719
Seems healthy,
but it's too early to tell.

39:47.844 --> 39:51.098
She's in the hospital for observation
for a few days. But after that...

39:51.223 --> 39:53.225
Best case, winds up
with her teenage father,

39:53.350 --> 39:56.520
who just got voted
captain of the varsity bullying team.

39:56.645 --> 39:57.687
He's just a kid.

40:00.107 --> 40:02.401
- You all right?
- I gotta go.

40:23.296 --> 40:25.340
- Jonathan?
- Yeah?

40:26.925 --> 40:28.468
It's Lawrence Kutner.

40:30.387 --> 40:31.888
Why are you here?

40:32.347 --> 40:35.225
I wanted to apologize
for all the horrible stuff

40:35.350 --> 40:37.102
I did to you in high school.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.312
I'm sorry.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.005
HOUSE: What's going
to happen to her?

41:05.130 --> 41:07.424
I spoke to both
sets of grandparents.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.678
It's too painful. They're putting
her up for adoption.

41:15.265 --> 41:16.808
What are you
going to do?

41:19.394 --> 41:21.104
I already spoke
to a lawyer.

41:23.732 --> 41:27.736
I become a foster parent
and then I adopt.

41:30.906 --> 41:31.907
(BABY CRIES)

41:39.956 --> 41:41.917
Merry Christmas, Cuddy.

41:42.042 --> 41:43.126
Hey.

42:09.236 --> 42:10.987
Where is everybody?

42:11.488 --> 42:12.697
Down at the party.

42:14.366 --> 42:16.576
I heard Janice is
back on the trial.

42:17.744 --> 42:19.204
My Christmas gift to you.

42:21.790 --> 42:24.709
I was wrong.
You're not House.

42:26.545 --> 42:28.964
Yeah. Well,
that's my Christmas gift to myself.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.682
We should go to the party.

42:41.184 --> 42:42.644
We should.
