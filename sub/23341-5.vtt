Previously on Beyond...

00:01.736 --> 00:03.653
You have no idea why
I called you up here today.

00:03.705 --> 00:05.004
Shoemacher.

00:08.827 --> 00:10.743
I keep having visions,

00:10.745 --> 00:12.795
and I don't know what they mean.

00:21.005 --> 00:22.004
Hey, taxi!

00:22.057 --> 00:24.674
Fort Reed, Kansas.

00:24.726 --> 00:26.092
You'll never guess who I saw yesterday.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.093
Charlie?

00:33.209 --> 00:35.092
What do you want?

00:35.128 --> 00:37.044
What do I... want? I...

00:38.097 --> 00:40.047
My mom said you were in Fort Reed.

00:40.099 --> 00:43.050
Yep. The lovely Dew Drop Inn.

00:43.052 --> 00:44.268
You weren't gonna tell me?

00:44.303 --> 00:46.103
Nope.

00:46.139 --> 00:48.389
Oh! Wait a sec.

00:52.311 --> 00:54.278
Keys to your truck.

00:54.313 --> 00:56.447
It's in the parking lot.
I washed it a few days ago,

00:56.482 --> 00:59.450
but it's dirty again.

00:59.485 --> 01:02.286
- You had my truck?
- Who did you think had it?

01:04.239 --> 01:06.374
I'm a little busy,
so I'll see you later.

01:06.409 --> 01:09.377
Whoa! Hey, Charlie. What is up with you?

01:09.412 --> 01:12.329
Look, I didn't know what
happened to you after the cabin.

01:12.382 --> 01:14.215
I didn't know if you were alive or dead.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.050
I'm not dead. Clearly, I'm fine.

01:16.085 --> 01:18.135
What are you doing in Fort Reed?

01:18.171 --> 01:19.970
Why were you buying a gun?

01:20.006 --> 01:21.222
What's goin' on out there?

01:23.259 --> 01:24.258
Who's this?

01:25.395 --> 01:27.261
You want me to take care of him for you?

01:27.263 --> 01:29.230
"Take care of me"? Who are you?

01:29.265 --> 01:32.099
You know what? You need
to go. You need to go.

01:32.151 --> 01:33.267
What? Like, leave?

01:33.269 --> 01:35.070
- Now?
- Leave. Go back to whatever

01:35.070 --> 01:37.232
trailer park or mechanical
bull is expecting you.

01:37.232 --> 01:39.190
- Whoa. Hey!
- Go.

01:39.242 --> 01:40.408
I'll call you!

01:40.443 --> 01:43.244
- Who was that?
- That was Randy.

01:43.279 --> 01:45.029
He's local.

01:45.081 --> 01:47.948
Look, Holden, it's really sweet
you looked me up and all,

01:48.000 --> 01:49.333
and hey, our little road trip was fun.

01:49.368 --> 01:51.085
I mean, before the shooting started,

01:51.120 --> 01:53.037
I had a legit good time
with you, Holden.

01:53.089 --> 01:54.455
Yeah, and I had a great time
with you too, but...

01:54.457 --> 01:56.424
But it was a giant mistake

01:56.459 --> 01:58.259
to look you up in the first place.

01:58.294 --> 02:00.344
And if you haven't
realized that already,

02:00.379 --> 02:01.962
you will.

02:04.267 --> 02:06.183
Charlie, wait! I...

02:08.437 --> 02:11.105
Just go, Holden.

02:11.140 --> 02:12.973
I'm not leaving, okay?

02:13.025 --> 02:14.191
- I'm gonna stay!
- Please...

02:14.227 --> 02:16.193
Charlie! I'll stay here
all night if I have to.

02:16.229 --> 02:18.028
- just go.
- Charlie!

02:18.064 --> 02:20.281
Open the door.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.951
Hello?

02:33.329 --> 02:35.212
Are you serious?

02:41.387 --> 02:45.089
Fixing the machine is the
only way to keep the Realm safe.

02:46.225 --> 02:48.342
Safe from what?

02:48.394 --> 02:50.427
Frost didn't make it out
with me and Holden.

02:52.064 --> 02:53.430
It's not just about your father.

02:55.101 --> 02:57.184
There will always be others
who wish to corrupt it.

02:57.186 --> 02:59.236
It corrupted me.

03:01.023 --> 03:02.907
I made so many mistakes.

03:04.944 --> 03:06.076
I lied to you.

03:07.163 --> 03:08.279
You had your reasons.

03:08.331 --> 03:10.915
I lied to others.

03:11.951 --> 03:13.200
I lied to myself.

03:13.252 --> 03:15.202
The Realm's power over me...

03:16.422 --> 03:18.339
I wasn't strong enough to resist it.

03:19.375 --> 03:21.008
I never wanted that for you.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.964
Maybe it's time we put
the Realm aside...

03:28.050 --> 03:29.300
and tried living in the real world.

03:35.274 --> 03:37.191
I wish it were that easy.

04:24.156 --> 04:25.356
Holden!

04:40.206 --> 04:41.422
Holden!

04:43.960 --> 04:45.292
Dude.

05:45.988 --> 05:47.271
Gotta say I'm a little nervous.

05:48.357 --> 05:50.407
My paperwork's all in order, no?

05:50.443 --> 05:52.943
Your assets have been
transferred to Hollow Sky.

05:52.995 --> 05:55.079
Thank you for your
extremely generous donation.

06:00.202 --> 06:02.953
That's what the Brave
New World looks like, huh?

06:05.091 --> 06:06.373
I've dreamt of this day.

06:06.375 --> 06:08.342
Seeing my Lara again.

06:10.346 --> 06:13.213
Yeah, I-I don't even know
what I'm gonna say to her.

06:15.184 --> 06:19.019
I wrote a few things down,
but I-I don't know...

06:19.055 --> 06:21.221
The paper won't make the trip anyway.

06:21.223 --> 06:23.023
The body remains.

06:23.059 --> 06:25.392
Only your consciousness
is transported to the Bridge.

06:28.064 --> 06:29.980
Besides...

06:30.032 --> 06:32.199
you already know what to say to her.

06:32.234 --> 06:33.233
It's all right here.

06:36.956 --> 06:38.122
Shall we?

06:48.134 --> 06:50.300
Right this way, sir.

06:52.304 --> 06:54.388
Please have a seat.

07:01.263 --> 07:03.147
I'm just going to be placing
this on your head.

07:05.401 --> 07:07.234
Relax.

07:07.269 --> 07:09.069
And look into the lights.

07:45.224 --> 07:50.477
You, uh, come here often?

07:51.475 --> 07:53.442
And remember the Beast was given a mouth

07:53.477 --> 07:56.395
to utter proud words and
blasphemies and to exercise...

08:36.488 --> 08:38.705
So, you've been having these nightmares?

08:38.741 --> 08:41.408
Ever since I came out of the coma.

08:41.460 --> 08:44.494
I always wind up in the woods
near where I crashed my bike.

08:44.547 --> 08:47.548
These visions or whatever...

08:47.583 --> 08:48.665
they've been getting worse ever since

08:48.717 --> 08:50.667
we were at Hollow Sky with Frost.

08:50.719 --> 08:53.303
When you went into the Matrix?

08:53.339 --> 08:55.589
Just feeling I broke something
when I was in there.

08:55.591 --> 08:57.591
Broke something? Like what?

08:57.593 --> 08:59.309
That's what I'm trying to find out.

09:01.430 --> 09:03.564
So, um...

09:03.599 --> 09:04.731
what's with the compass?

09:06.569 --> 09:08.318
Jack Sparrow have a yard sale?

09:09.605 --> 09:12.272
The compass is connected to the Realm.

09:12.274 --> 09:13.657
It used to just spin around.

09:13.692 --> 09:17.361
I though it was busted,
but after Hollow Sky...

09:17.413 --> 09:19.696
it just started pointing one direction.

09:19.748 --> 09:21.698
I don't know. Maybe it's like
a weird magnetic thing.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.284
Because, like, compasses work
off the Earth's magnetic field.

09:24.336 --> 09:26.453
- I know how magnets work, Luke.
- So maybe it's like buried treasure.

09:26.505 --> 09:28.422
It's not treasure, all right?
My nightmares are trying

09:28.457 --> 09:31.425
to... tell me... something.

09:31.460 --> 09:34.461
I... wait. Wait a minute.

09:34.513 --> 09:35.596
Okay.

09:37.633 --> 09:38.765
Well, what's Willa's take?

09:40.719 --> 09:43.437
I don't know. She says it's guilt or...

09:43.472 --> 09:45.389
paranoia or...

09:45.441 --> 09:46.690
guilt about being paranoid.

09:48.477 --> 09:50.644
You know, all she wanted me
to do was remember,

09:50.696 --> 09:53.447
and now she wants to act
like it's over and done with.

09:53.482 --> 09:55.782
I don't know. She's going
through a lot, dude.

09:55.818 --> 09:58.318
Finding out that psycho's her dad,

09:58.370 --> 10:00.737
and then thinking her mom's
stuck in that place, like...

10:00.789 --> 10:02.489
She told you that?

10:04.660 --> 10:06.493
Yeah, no, or you did. I don't know.

10:09.581 --> 10:12.549
So where you're standing, that's where
the compass is telling you to go?

10:12.584 --> 10:14.668
Uh, yeah. I guess so.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.504
Well, one, do you feel
more, like, powers-y?

10:17.556 --> 10:18.805
- Ow.
- Hey.

10:18.841 --> 10:20.340
Okay, great.

10:20.342 --> 10:22.342
Luke, you don't have to do anything.

10:22.344 --> 10:23.510
Okay? I don't need your help.

10:23.562 --> 10:24.761
I want to help.

10:24.813 --> 10:26.680
I'm out here at dawn, aren't I?

10:27.733 --> 10:29.349
Okay, Luke.

10:31.854 --> 10:34.571
Okay, great. Well, you, uh...

10:34.606 --> 10:36.406
you let me know when
you've cracked the case.

10:39.528 --> 10:40.527
Holden?

10:42.448 --> 10:43.697
Look!

10:43.749 --> 10:45.832
Whoa! Wait. Wait a minute.

10:45.868 --> 10:47.534
Is that a...

10:47.536 --> 10:49.503
- Is that a rope?
- Yeah!

10:52.791 --> 10:54.374
That's buried deep.

10:54.426 --> 10:57.461
Maybe it's attached to something
buried even deeper.

10:57.513 --> 10:58.545
Treasure.

10:59.765 --> 11:01.381
See?

11:03.519 --> 11:04.718
We need shovels.

11:05.804 --> 11:08.555
Luke! Come on, we need shovels!

11:08.557 --> 11:11.308
Come on!

11:33.749 --> 11:37.751
Well, I got something on Shoemacher.

11:37.803 --> 11:40.587
Richard invites me over to the house.

11:40.589 --> 11:41.671
Thought you and Rich were friends.

11:41.724 --> 11:43.807
More than friends, Ramon.

11:43.842 --> 11:45.592
He was my mentor.

11:47.429 --> 11:49.396
If it wasn't for Richard,
I'd be dead or in jail.

11:51.483 --> 11:52.733
I have purpose in my life
because of Richard.

11:55.854 --> 11:58.438
It was a case of me or him.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.690
For a second there,
I thought it was gonna be me.

12:00.743 --> 12:02.442
And yet, here I stand.

12:10.452 --> 12:11.785
You want the legs or the head?

12:18.594 --> 12:20.427
Oh.

12:23.632 --> 12:24.681
Rats!

12:37.362 --> 12:38.478
All right.

12:52.661 --> 12:53.710
Ah.

13:06.809 --> 13:08.475
Willa?

14:18.413 --> 14:19.579
Willa?

14:39.673 --> 14:42.758
Was, uh, Dad pretty upset when you quit?

14:42.760 --> 14:44.760
He was disappointed.

14:45.763 --> 14:48.680
You and him working together...

14:48.732 --> 14:51.733
I haven't seen him
that excited since, like, ever.

14:51.769 --> 14:54.436
You know, or maybe coaching
your Little League.

14:54.438 --> 14:56.522
He loved Little League.

14:56.574 --> 14:58.490
Yeah, he used to yell at all the umps...
and the coaches.

14:58.526 --> 15:01.493
- On his own team.
- Yeah.

15:01.529 --> 15:04.413
Yeah, I remember how totally gutted
he was when you quit that.

15:04.448 --> 15:06.615
- This is different.
- You crushed him.

15:06.617 --> 15:08.700
I just wish I could tell him the truth.

15:08.752 --> 15:10.619
- Which you can't.
- I know! I...

15:10.671 --> 15:12.704
hate lying to him.

15:12.756 --> 15:14.289
Like I hated lying to you.

15:14.341 --> 15:17.292
All I'm saying, man,
is you got these powers.

15:17.294 --> 15:18.377
Might as well use 'em.

15:18.429 --> 15:19.761
Use them?

15:19.797 --> 15:23.432
I'm headed into the woods
to dig up a buried rope

15:23.467 --> 15:26.301
because of my nightmares
and some stupid compass.

15:26.353 --> 15:27.519
We're headed into the woods.

15:27.555 --> 15:29.605
Technically, there's two of us.

15:29.640 --> 15:32.441
Not that you'd ever return the favor.

15:32.476 --> 15:34.393
What's that supposed to mean?

15:34.445 --> 15:36.202
You obviously didn't notice
the little souvenir I got

15:36.202 --> 15:37.733
from helping out Riley.

15:38.482 --> 15:41.483
Whoa, wait. The guy who stole
Riley's pills punched you?

15:42.486 --> 15:43.785
What did you think happened?

15:43.821 --> 15:45.654
That I ran into a wall sleepwalking?

15:45.706 --> 15:47.623
I told you to stay away from Riley.

15:47.658 --> 15:49.324
I asked for your help.

15:49.376 --> 15:50.492
You didn't want to help,

15:50.544 --> 15:52.544
- so I dealt with it.
- You call that dealing with it?

15:52.580 --> 15:55.464
I'm just saying that you could've
used your powers to scare him.

15:55.499 --> 15:57.499
But apparently, that's
just for cheating at pool

15:57.501 --> 15:58.667
and destroying Dad's workplace.

15:58.669 --> 16:01.420
I'm not a circus animal!
They're not magic tricks!

16:01.472 --> 16:03.639
How do you even know what they are
when all you do is whine about them?

16:03.674 --> 16:06.508
I'm not whining about them!
I just can't control them,

16:06.560 --> 16:08.459
or know when they're gonna kick in,
or who's gonna get hurt

16:08.459 --> 16:10.312
- because of them.
- Whining.

16:17.354 --> 16:19.521
So who do you think buried it?

16:19.573 --> 16:21.323
Huh?

16:21.358 --> 16:23.492
Somebody had to bury the rope.

16:23.527 --> 16:25.494
It's not like it just
sprung up from the Realm.

16:26.747 --> 16:28.497
Wait.

16:28.532 --> 16:29.581
Is the Realm down there?

16:29.617 --> 16:31.366
Yeah.

16:31.418 --> 16:33.368
And the rope is connected to China.

16:57.728 --> 16:59.394
Looks good to me, boss.

17:00.481 --> 17:02.698
When it comes to burying a body,
how deep should the hole be?

17:04.367 --> 17:06.652
Oh, it's six feet, no?

17:06.704 --> 17:09.404
That's right, and this hole,
you reckon, is six feet deep?

17:13.743 --> 17:15.410
Want to get back inside for me?

17:22.636 --> 17:25.671
Should I, uh... lay down?

17:25.723 --> 17:27.255
No, standing's good.

17:28.425 --> 17:29.508
How tall are you, Ramon?

17:30.644 --> 17:33.478
Between 5'5, 5'9 depending on the shoes.

17:33.514 --> 17:35.597
So the hole seems good?

17:37.568 --> 17:38.650
Pretty much.

17:44.408 --> 17:47.409
Hey, you wanna go deeper,
we can go deeper, no problem.

17:47.444 --> 17:49.277
Shame it had to come to this.

17:49.330 --> 17:50.779
We prepared for a future without Frost.

17:50.781 --> 17:54.783
But she's corrupted his ideals.

17:57.671 --> 17:59.454
It's like she was waiting
for him to be gone

17:59.456 --> 18:01.289
to turn it into an afterlife ATM.

18:02.459 --> 18:04.426
She tried to have you killed.

18:04.461 --> 18:05.544
What are you gonna do?

18:05.596 --> 18:09.297
Well, the way I see it, I can run...

18:09.350 --> 18:10.549
or put a bullet in her head.

18:11.635 --> 18:13.301
I'm not gonna run.

18:19.393 --> 18:20.642
Yes? Can I help you?

18:21.695 --> 18:23.612
Good morning.

18:23.647 --> 18:24.696
Is that your automobile?

18:24.732 --> 18:27.699
The Cutlass? Well, yeah.

18:28.736 --> 18:30.485
My car's not operable.

18:31.538 --> 18:32.738
Could I call a tow truck?

18:32.790 --> 18:34.740
Is it a long distance call?

18:36.377 --> 18:38.710
No. I don't think so.

18:40.330 --> 18:42.381
Perhaps I could have
a glass of water as well?

18:47.554 --> 18:48.637
I suppose so.

18:50.340 --> 18:51.723
Oh, I have a "No shoes
in the house" rule...

18:53.560 --> 18:55.310
if you don't mind.

18:55.345 --> 18:56.511
Don't mind at all.

19:04.438 --> 19:06.521
You think if Mom and Ian broke up,

19:06.573 --> 19:08.490
she wants to get back together with Dad?

19:08.525 --> 19:11.243
Dude, this isn't "The Parent Trap."

19:11.278 --> 19:13.495
They were arguing the whole
time you were asleep.

19:14.665 --> 19:15.664
How bad did it get?

19:17.284 --> 19:20.368
Bad. Dad kinda checked out...

19:21.538 --> 19:22.704
and Mom found Jesus

19:22.756 --> 19:24.539
and then found Ian.

19:24.541 --> 19:26.675
No, but I'd rather them be happy,

19:26.710 --> 19:28.427
even if it's not with each other.

19:29.713 --> 19:30.712
God, that's corny.

19:45.562 --> 19:48.313
Did you just drink all the water, dude?

19:48.365 --> 19:49.564
I was the one that brought the thermos.

19:49.616 --> 19:52.484
I... I thought we were sharing.

19:52.536 --> 19:54.536
Yeah, well, you slobbering
over the spout,

19:54.571 --> 19:56.655
I let that go, but you didn't have
to drink all the water.

19:58.792 --> 20:00.408
- Sorry.
- Move.

20:05.499 --> 20:06.665
What's that?

20:19.596 --> 20:20.729
It's a freezer.

20:22.516 --> 20:24.349
How do you... how do you know that?

20:26.436 --> 20:27.602
Because I've seen this before.

20:33.293 --> 20:36.027
I've seen this freezer.

20:36.063 --> 20:37.479
You mean, in your nightmares?

20:37.481 --> 20:39.197
And my waking freak-outs.

20:39.233 --> 20:41.149
Hold up, what do you mean
"waking freak-outs"?

20:41.151 --> 20:43.034
Yeah, at work,

20:43.070 --> 20:44.319
my computer started bleeding

20:44.371 --> 20:47.122
and my desk became this freezer.

20:47.157 --> 20:49.157
So, right, you've been...

20:49.209 --> 20:52.244
seeing this stuff in, like,
your normal, every day life?

20:52.296 --> 20:54.329
There's nothing normal about this.

20:54.331 --> 20:56.131
Okay, hold... okay, just... just...

20:56.166 --> 20:57.382
just hold up, hold up, hold up.

20:57.417 --> 20:59.167
Holden, Holden, Holden!

20:59.169 --> 21:00.302
Let's just take a beat.

21:00.337 --> 21:01.386
Okay?

21:01.421 --> 21:03.388
Now maybe there's just a...

21:03.423 --> 21:05.006
a logical explanation for all this.

21:05.008 --> 21:07.175
What kind of logical explanation, Luke?

21:07.177 --> 21:08.426
I don't know.
You've been trying to figure out

21:08.479 --> 21:10.395
what this all means,
but now you seem like...

21:10.430 --> 21:12.264
I don't know, disappointed
that we found something.

21:12.316 --> 21:13.482
Don't you get it?

21:13.517 --> 21:16.101
It means I'm not crazy!

21:16.153 --> 21:18.436
Okay, dude, I'm seriously
confused. Like...

21:18.489 --> 21:20.438
do you want to be crazy or not crazy?

21:20.491 --> 21:22.324
Luke, this isn't a joke, okay?

21:22.359 --> 21:25.243
Something bad is going to happen.

21:25.279 --> 21:27.195
- How do you know that?
- Because I've seen it!

21:29.533 --> 21:31.199
I had a nightmare.

21:32.252 --> 21:34.369
And your face was...

21:34.371 --> 21:37.088
covered in these maggots.

21:37.124 --> 21:38.373
Okay, and the house caught on fire

21:38.425 --> 21:41.376
with you, Mom, and Dad inside of it.

21:41.378 --> 21:43.211
You've been having visions of us dying?

21:43.263 --> 21:45.263
Okay, it wasn't just the house.

21:45.299 --> 21:48.350
It was like the whole world
was on fire...

21:49.386 --> 21:51.353
because of what I did.

21:51.388 --> 21:54.105
Hey, hey. Dude, it's not your fault.

21:54.141 --> 21:56.274
No, you don't know that, okay?

21:56.310 --> 21:58.360
This is why I wanted a normal life!

21:59.396 --> 22:01.146
But now, I...

22:01.198 --> 22:04.366
the job is gone, whatever I had with
Willa is screwed up,

22:04.401 --> 22:07.369
and my own brother...

22:07.404 --> 22:10.205
wants me to use my super powers

22:10.240 --> 22:12.123
- to help him get laid by a girl...
- Wait.

22:12.159 --> 22:14.075
- who screwed him over twice!
- Whoa, whoa.

22:14.127 --> 22:15.210
Whoa. Hey, I'm...

22:15.245 --> 22:17.212
I'm not the one at fault here either.

22:17.247 --> 22:18.413
I didn't bury this freezer.

22:18.415 --> 22:22.083
I know, but you wanted me
to follow the superhero path.

22:22.085 --> 22:25.420
Well, that path doesn't lead to fighting
bad guys and saving people.

22:25.422 --> 22:27.255
It leads to a...

22:27.257 --> 22:29.140
freezer in the woods,

22:29.176 --> 22:31.092
and I don't know what any of it means.

22:31.144 --> 22:33.061
Only it means that I'm not crazy,

22:33.096 --> 22:35.096
- and that's what's even more crazy.
- Holden. Holden, it's okay.

22:35.148 --> 22:36.740
Cause I don't know any of it!

22:36.764 --> 22:38.239
Holden, it's okay! We can
figure this out.

22:38.239 --> 22:41.152
How are we gonna figure this out, Luke?
Are you gonna fix it a cappuccino?

22:50.080 --> 22:51.363
You know what?

22:51.415 --> 22:53.331
I came out here to help you,

22:53.367 --> 22:57.035
- because I care.
- No, Luke, it...

22:57.087 --> 22:58.300
that's not what I meant.

22:58.300 --> 23:02.040
No, I'm hearing you loud and clear,
man. I gotta be at work.

23:02.125 --> 23:03.375
Cappuccinos to make.

23:05.128 --> 23:06.211
Luke, come on.

23:10.017 --> 23:11.266
I didn't mean it.

23:18.308 --> 23:20.058
Mmm.

23:20.110 --> 23:21.309
It's apple butter.

23:22.396 --> 23:24.980
My nephew buys it at the Amish store.

23:26.116 --> 23:28.366
- It's delicious.
- Mm.

23:28.402 --> 23:30.151
Could I borrow your vehicle?

23:31.238 --> 23:33.405
My Cutlass? No.

23:34.491 --> 23:37.042
I use it to go into town once a week,

23:37.127 --> 23:39.327
and to Doris Hoover's
for bridge on Tuesdays.

23:48.422 --> 23:50.305
So you say you're
on the way to Fort Reed?

23:51.475 --> 23:53.341
Yes.

23:53.343 --> 23:55.477
To visit Holden Matthews.

23:55.512 --> 23:58.346
What's so special about this
Holden Matthews fella?

23:59.483 --> 24:02.067
Everything is special about Holden.

24:06.023 --> 24:08.023
Holden stands in the way of destiny.

24:10.193 --> 24:12.360
You mean to do that boy harm, don't you?

24:14.031 --> 24:15.413
He opened a portal to another world.

24:17.117 --> 24:19.200
I come from that world.

24:19.252 --> 24:21.286
I was born of fire and darkness.

24:22.456 --> 24:26.007
I'm the first of many
who will walk upon this Earth.

24:26.043 --> 24:27.459
When we're done,

24:27.511 --> 24:30.011
nothing you know will remain.

24:31.264 --> 24:33.348
I'm not afraid of death, young man.

24:36.186 --> 24:40.305
Those awaiting Fields of Elysium
won't escape what's coming.

24:40.357 --> 24:43.308
This world, the world I came from,

24:43.360 --> 24:45.310
the hereafter you speak of,

24:45.362 --> 24:47.395
it'll all be engulfed in flames.

24:49.282 --> 24:51.149
We will destroy everything.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.236
And then we'll rebuild per our design.

25:02.295 --> 25:03.962
Now...

25:03.997 --> 25:05.413
about those car keys.

25:17.094 --> 25:18.343
Here.

25:18.395 --> 25:21.012
It's a Cafe Americano.
I know you don't take it black,

25:21.064 --> 25:23.348
so I added a touch of almond milk.

25:23.400 --> 25:24.983
Okay.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.354
Blech! God! It's so terrible.

25:31.108 --> 25:33.441
I think the almond milk
actually makes it worse.

25:33.493 --> 25:36.111
Well, good thing I brought your usual.

25:36.113 --> 25:38.279
- Yay!
- I will find a coffee drink you like.

25:38.281 --> 25:40.281
Mark my words.

25:42.119 --> 25:43.168
Is that a black eye?

25:44.454 --> 25:46.121
Yeah, you noticed.

25:46.173 --> 25:48.173
What? You got into a fight?

25:48.208 --> 25:50.091
Yeah, you should see
the other dude's fist.

25:52.179 --> 25:53.344
I was helping out a friend.

25:53.380 --> 25:56.014
Long story short, Riley lied to me,

25:56.049 --> 25:57.182
and I got stupidly involved,

25:57.217 --> 25:59.100
and now I owe this
Jay guy, like, $2,000.

25:59.136 --> 26:01.352
Wait. You owe Jay $2,000?

26:01.388 --> 26:04.355
Riley's debt is now my debt.

26:04.391 --> 26:05.974
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

26:05.976 --> 26:07.358
That doesn't seem fair.

26:10.063 --> 26:12.030
So, um...

26:12.065 --> 26:13.314
what's with the spirals?

26:15.318 --> 26:17.152
Something on your mind?

26:18.205 --> 26:20.405
- No.
- Hmm.

26:22.075 --> 26:23.408
You know, my Religion 101
teacher said that

26:23.460 --> 26:26.044
spirals represent the journey of life.

26:26.079 --> 26:29.164
You know, they remind us
of where we've been,

26:29.216 --> 26:31.049
and where we want to go.

26:32.335 --> 26:35.136
Wow. That, um... that's really deep.

26:35.172 --> 26:37.138
Super deep.

26:37.174 --> 26:40.058
And it sort of, uh, totally makes sense.

26:40.093 --> 26:41.176
I think.

26:42.345 --> 26:45.346
Um, it's Arthur.

26:45.348 --> 26:47.348
I thought he was getting better,

26:47.350 --> 26:49.350
and then I get this frantic phone call.

26:49.402 --> 26:51.186
He thinks somebody broke into the house.

26:51.238 --> 26:53.188
"Thinks somebody broke into the house"?

26:53.190 --> 26:55.356
He's been confused.

26:55.358 --> 26:59.110
Called me Celeste,
my mother, last night.

26:59.162 --> 27:01.996
And, um, not for the first time.

27:02.032 --> 27:05.083
I'm sorry. That must be hard.

27:13.009 --> 27:14.175
Speak of the devil.

27:17.013 --> 27:19.380
I gotta go deal with the
thing and the...

27:19.382 --> 27:21.382
And the money, Lebowski.

27:23.136 --> 27:24.969
I'm sorry.

27:53.049 --> 27:54.299
Here.

27:54.334 --> 27:56.417
Attach the grapple to the chains.

27:56.469 --> 27:59.387
Maybe dig out a little incline.

27:59.422 --> 28:01.256
Then we should be able
to pull it out, no problem.

28:01.258 --> 28:02.974
Okay. Great.

28:03.009 --> 28:04.392
No, not "okay, great."

28:04.427 --> 28:07.095
I don't get why this icebox
is in the ground.

28:07.147 --> 28:08.313
I've been having these visions...

28:08.348 --> 28:10.181
And nightmares. Yeah, I got that.

28:10.233 --> 28:11.266
I think it's connected to something

28:11.318 --> 28:12.934
I did in the Realm

28:12.986 --> 28:14.402
when I went in there to save Willa.

28:14.437 --> 28:15.937
Every time you mention The Realm,

28:15.989 --> 28:17.322
my brain scrambles.

28:17.357 --> 28:19.324
Think this is Hollow Sky or...

28:19.359 --> 28:20.441
Possibly.

28:20.443 --> 28:23.111
Whatever it is, I need
to figure it out before...

28:24.281 --> 28:25.280
people get hurt.

28:26.333 --> 28:27.949
What do you mean, "people get hurt"?

28:28.001 --> 28:29.250
That's what I saw.

28:29.286 --> 28:31.419
Terrible things happened...

28:31.454 --> 28:35.423
or will happen. I hope I'm wrong.

28:35.458 --> 28:38.376
I saw you flip a car
and stop a hail of bullets.

28:38.428 --> 28:41.095
Can't you lift this icebox
out of the ground with your mind

28:41.131 --> 28:43.264
and save us some trouble?

28:43.300 --> 28:45.383
Man, maybe I am a circus animal.

28:46.469 --> 28:49.354
And besides, I've tried.

28:49.389 --> 28:50.438
Repeatedly.

28:56.446 --> 28:58.146
Hey, what's that?

28:58.198 --> 29:00.148
- What's what?
- Right by your foot.

29:02.452 --> 29:03.985
Right there, man.

29:09.993 --> 29:13.211
"Property of Edgar L. Abbot."

29:14.331 --> 29:15.413
Who's Edgar L. Abbot?

29:18.385 --> 29:19.417
I don't know.

29:21.504 --> 29:23.338
Maybe he'll have a key for this padlock.

29:24.341 --> 29:25.974
We could try and pick it.

29:26.009 --> 29:27.976
- Yeah.
- I might have something in the truck.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.116
Hello?

30:49.092 --> 30:51.175
Whoa! Are you okay?

30:51.227 --> 30:52.737
- What happened?
- You grabbed the padlock

30:52.737 --> 30:54.431
and you wouldn't let go.

30:58.351 --> 31:00.184
Where the hell were you, Matthews?

31:01.438 --> 31:05.106
I saw the Realm, I think, but...

31:06.443 --> 31:08.326
What the hell's inside this freezer?

31:09.446 --> 31:11.112
Whatever it is...

31:11.164 --> 31:12.997
I'm pretty sure
we don't want any part of it.

31:23.417 --> 31:24.533
Evening, Diane.

31:26.203 --> 31:28.537
God, Ian. You startled me.

31:28.539 --> 31:31.206
Lucky for me, you don't
carry pepper spray.

31:36.130 --> 31:38.430
So, I, uh, had a Hollow Sky
deal in Wichita.

31:38.466 --> 31:41.300
It is growing like wildfire.

31:41.352 --> 31:44.386
Any luck in, um, getting me a tour

31:44.438 --> 31:47.222
of Hollow Sky headquarters?

31:47.274 --> 31:49.191
Working on it.

31:50.361 --> 31:53.529
Oh, and speaking of,
well, Helping Hands, anyway,

31:53.564 --> 31:55.314
you will not believe who crashed

31:55.366 --> 31:57.399
our church basement meeting
night before last.

31:58.619 --> 32:00.235
Jeff McArdle.

32:02.456 --> 32:04.073
Jeff McArdle?

32:05.076 --> 32:06.325
Yeah. He was with Christine.

32:06.377 --> 32:08.544
Maybe his intentions are pure,

32:08.579 --> 32:11.163
but after the incident in my office...

32:11.215 --> 32:14.216
I'll talk to Jeff and...
and see where his head's at.

32:14.251 --> 32:16.251
Ah, it's okay.

32:16.303 --> 32:18.170
If he's there for Christine,

32:18.222 --> 32:19.421
who am I to question his motives?

32:22.393 --> 32:25.427
Not to impose, but I wouldn't say no
to a cup of coffee...

32:25.429 --> 32:27.096
or two.

32:28.232 --> 32:29.431
It's too late for coffee,

32:29.433 --> 32:32.267
and Holden should be home soon, so.

32:33.320 --> 32:38.323
Ian, I know we're still
trying to figure out us.

32:38.359 --> 32:40.275
Maybe we should get away for a weekend

32:40.277 --> 32:42.444
and then we can really connect.

32:42.446 --> 32:44.246
Sure.

32:44.281 --> 32:46.248
We always talked about
going to the Hot Springs.

32:46.283 --> 32:47.583
Yes, yes!

32:47.618 --> 32:49.585
So, we'll set a date.

32:49.620 --> 32:51.120
How's this weekend?

32:54.542 --> 32:57.176
This weekend is, um...

32:57.211 --> 33:00.129
- yes, okay.
- Great. Well, I look forward to it.

33:06.187 --> 33:08.137
Goodnight, Diane.

33:08.189 --> 33:09.438
Goodnight.

33:28.576 --> 33:30.459
If this is where you say
something clever

33:30.494 --> 33:32.127
before you kill me,

33:32.163 --> 33:33.328
you can skip to the latter.

33:34.582 --> 33:37.299
Though if you insist,

33:37.334 --> 33:39.134
maybe "The shoe is on the other foot."

33:39.170 --> 33:40.502
Sit.

33:51.432 --> 33:54.149
I did come to kill you,
and you deserve it.

33:54.185 --> 33:56.351
One good turn.

33:56.403 --> 33:58.237
I shouldn't have called you a janitor.

33:58.272 --> 34:00.155
Oh, you didn't mean that
as a compliment?

34:06.247 --> 34:08.280
Richard's dead. That's on you.

34:08.331 --> 34:11.333
Plus, there's the file folder
I got from your safe.

34:11.368 --> 34:13.284
Plus, there's the cancer
that's eating you.

34:13.337 --> 34:15.204
You're slipping, Tess.

34:15.255 --> 34:17.206
Pull the trigger.

34:17.208 --> 34:19.507
Your bullet, my cancer.
What's the difference?

34:19.543 --> 34:21.293
Cancer might not kill you.

34:21.378 --> 34:24.129
Doctors say 43% chance of survival.

34:24.181 --> 34:25.214
It's not zero.

34:26.550 --> 34:29.351
Plan was, you walk in the room,
I shoot, you're dead.

34:29.386 --> 34:31.386
Trust me. You don't want those odds.

34:33.389 --> 34:34.389
But then...

34:36.110 --> 34:37.391
I found this on your desk.

34:44.400 --> 34:45.534
Driving to Richard's house,

34:45.569 --> 34:49.204
knowing he might kill me,
I wasn't scared. I was angry.

34:50.324 --> 34:52.291
He tried to rob me of watching
my daughter grow up.

34:53.577 --> 34:57.296
Whatever beef we have,
your child doesn't deserve that.

34:58.332 --> 35:00.132
You have a wife. You'll have a kid soon.

35:01.252 --> 35:03.418
Your life belongs to them.

35:03.420 --> 35:05.137
Okay.

35:08.425 --> 35:10.142
Where does that leave us?

35:10.177 --> 35:14.146
The future of Hollow Sky's
too important to stand idly by.

35:14.181 --> 35:17.316
And last we met, you offered me a say
in the decision-making.

35:18.435 --> 35:20.269
I know you didn't mean it
at the time, but...

35:21.522 --> 35:24.106
times have changed.

35:24.108 --> 35:26.241
You wanna trade your gun
for a suit and a tie,

35:26.277 --> 35:28.360
- and a 401K?
- No.

35:28.412 --> 35:30.529
I'll gladly continue doing
Hollow Sky's dirty work,

35:30.581 --> 35:33.448
but from now on, it'll be on my terms.

35:35.252 --> 35:36.451
And what are those terms?

35:36.503 --> 35:39.454
Frost left big shoes to fill.

35:39.456 --> 35:41.256
Maybe you need help filling them.

35:41.292 --> 35:42.541
I mean financial terms.

35:42.593 --> 35:45.377
It's not about money. Never has been.

35:52.219 --> 35:53.268
I can make that deal.

35:55.356 --> 35:58.106
If we're going to be partners,

35:58.142 --> 35:59.274
there's something you should see.

36:15.409 --> 36:16.491
You're Jay?

36:19.496 --> 36:22.047
The kid ain't mine, yo.

36:22.082 --> 36:24.333
I heard you have some outstanding
business with Luke Matthews.

36:31.475 --> 36:33.342
And what's it to you...

36:33.394 --> 36:35.177
Leather Barbie?

36:55.366 --> 36:58.200
Whatever you think Luke owes you,

36:58.202 --> 36:59.418
that debt's erased.

37:00.454 --> 37:02.204
Understand?

37:02.206 --> 37:04.339
Okay.

37:21.415 --> 37:25.534
- Hey! I come bearing scones.
- Oh.

37:25.867 --> 37:28.868
I notice you had
a proclivity for blueberry.

37:29.977 --> 37:31.227
They were just gonna throw 'em out.

37:33.197 --> 37:35.197
Well, thanks.

37:35.233 --> 37:39.318
And you're right. I do have a
proclivity for, um, blueberries.

37:39.370 --> 37:41.287
I mean...

37:41.322 --> 37:43.906
So you know that guy
I was mentioning earlier?

37:43.958 --> 37:45.991
What guy?

37:46.043 --> 37:49.211
That guy with whom I had the
predatory business transaction?

37:49.247 --> 37:51.213
Oh, um, yeah.

37:51.249 --> 37:53.132
Jay? Why?

38:00.258 --> 38:02.891
"Forget it, bro. We square."

38:03.928 --> 38:05.094
So it worked itself out?

38:10.101 --> 38:11.900
Maybe Riley did the right thing.

38:11.936 --> 38:14.320
Yeah, I can guarantee
that is not the case.

38:19.277 --> 38:21.193
Uh, yeah, anyway.

38:21.245 --> 38:22.945
Enjoy the scones.

38:24.999 --> 38:26.198
Do you want a cup of tea?

38:27.952 --> 38:30.286
Uh, I'm not really a tea guy.

38:32.206 --> 38:33.872
Not a tea guy?

38:35.042 --> 38:37.126
I'm gonna find a tea you like.

38:37.128 --> 38:38.260
Mark my words.

39:32.266 --> 39:34.983
- Charlie, what are you...
- Shh.

40:06.016 --> 40:07.182
Is he dead?

40:07.218 --> 40:08.350
No.

40:08.386 --> 40:11.220
Mr. Sheldrake is in a state
of suspended animation.

40:11.272 --> 40:14.056
As you can see,
we monitor his brain activity.

40:15.142 --> 40:17.059
Basically, the blood stops
flowing through the body.

40:17.061 --> 40:19.027
Just enough to keep
the vital organs working,

40:19.063 --> 40:21.196
till at which future point,
we can revive him.

40:21.232 --> 40:22.281
You put him in a coma?

40:22.316 --> 40:25.901
Cryogenic sleep is more accurate.

40:25.953 --> 40:28.629
But when he went under, he thought he
was going to the Afterlife?

40:29.123 --> 40:30.989
You lied to him.

40:31.041 --> 40:33.075
We don't even know the Realm exists.

40:33.077 --> 40:34.243
Frost knows!

40:35.329 --> 40:37.129
Knew.

40:37.164 --> 40:39.214
- He saw it.
- He thought he knew.

40:39.250 --> 40:42.301
- It's an unproven hypothesis.
- He believed.

40:42.336 --> 40:44.086
Hollow Sky was built on those beliefs.

40:44.138 --> 40:46.422
Frost was selling something
he couldn't deliver.

40:46.424 --> 40:48.257
And now all of Hollow Sky faithful

40:48.259 --> 40:50.342
want to follow him
into the great beyond.

41:00.187 --> 41:02.070
Then we have to fix the technology.

41:04.191 --> 41:06.275
We have to manage the situation.

41:06.327 --> 41:09.111
Right now, that means
finding a bigger place

41:09.163 --> 41:10.946
to put all the bodies.

41:17.037 --> 41:18.120
Welcome to management.
