not without you

05:29.680 --> 05:34.629
that's when I got very much days were
over oh I never got a chance to compete

05:34.629 --> 05:37.629
in Ironman last year so i'm back to give
it another try

05:37.629 --> 05:40.629
and how's baby Luke are you coping

05:42.550 --> 05:45.550
it's been tough since Richard left no
chance of reconciliation

05:46.699 --> 05:47.579
yeah

05:47.579 --> 05:50.568
doesn't look like that

05:50.569 --> 05:55.550
especially hard when I don't have the
bonus of a trainer like JD Jessy about

05:55.550 --> 05:58.569
JD I heard

05:58.569 --> 06:01.569
congratulations on your engagement
that's wonderful news

06:02.228 --> 06:03.819
you know

06:03.819 --> 06:08.528
not sure I heard from JD he wrote it

06:08.528 --> 06:12.399
just heard is everything all right
victim has a possible neck structure

06:12.399 --> 06:17.199
Jesse are you doing dat jesse owens
flash in the pan

06:17.199 --> 06:21.848

good to see you

going to go to the hospital

06:33.629 --> 06:34.930
mmm

06:34.930 --> 06:40.000
it's not good news it's a t5 break which
means there's going to be some paralysis

06:40.000 --> 06:45.850
extensive too early to say for the
moment we want to monitor him and then

06:45.850 --> 06:49.720
we've got to do a stabilizing procedure
to better determine a long-term

06:49.720 --> 06:51.009
prognosis

06:51.009 --> 06:54.100
I'm sorry

06:56.300 --> 06:59.300
thanks we've got it

06:59.860 --> 07:02.780
the doctors are saying

07:02.779 --> 07:06.259
we're so sorry

07:06.259 --> 07:11.329
there's anything we can do no there's
nothing anyone can do now

07:13.189 --> 07:14.249
I think

07:14.249 --> 07:16.670

your front arm in

that Jesse knew we were getting married

07:56.189 --> 07:59.189

10:57.058 --> 10:59.850
positioned every 200 yards in kayaks

10:59.850 --> 11:03.778
Sean this is where Baywatch can help you
can have your team cover the South leg

11:03.778 --> 11:05.698
then the corner lifeguards will handle
the rest

11:05.698 --> 11:10.169
no problem morning everyone sorry I'm
late we're just finishing up JD shotgun

11:10.169 --> 11:11.578

20:58.339 --> 21:03.019
look I came here to do our job and to be
with you

21:03.019 --> 21:06.859
I sure wasn't looking for an extra gig
training Jesse you to cook that up

21:06.859 --> 21:10.849
because i thought our relationship was
much stronger than any relationship we

21:10.849 --> 21:15.619
have with Jesse and it is now I'm not
sure feels right

21:16.130 --> 21:19.530
I understand it's

21:19.529 --> 21:22.389
yeah

21:22.390 --> 21:28.570
it's weird you know what I know is that
you've been acting weird since jesse

21:28.569 --> 21:31.569
step in front of your face

21:32.419 --> 21:35.419
k color

21:36.679 --> 21:42.798
I have to tell you something I haven't
told you till now because I'm trying to

21:42.798 --> 21:46.009
figure out the right thing to do

it looks like I mean

21:51.849 --> 22:00.219
I'm father Jesse's baby you're how is
that possible

22:00.799 --> 22:05.269
look we can work this out just because i
have this baby doesn't mean it changes

22:05.269 --> 22:06.710
anything between you and me

22:06.710 --> 22:10.610
what are you talking about Janie you're
the father of Jesse's baby that doesn't

22:10.609 --> 22:11.869
change things

22:11.869 --> 22:17.029
it doesn't have to I just need some time
to figure things out

22:17.839 --> 22:21.289
k call you gotta believe me

22:21.289 --> 22:26.149
getting married to you is more important
than anything baby

22:26.750 --> 22:35.029
we can't hear any more of this JD go
train with Jesse I need some time

22:35.929 --> 22:40.100

whether or not we still getting married

22:40.880 --> 22:43.880

23:04.839 --> 23:07.839
how'd you sleep

23:08.528 --> 23:11.528
fine I guess

23:13.680 --> 23:18.740
yeah have some coffee thanks thanks

23:18.740 --> 23:22.339
how did we get here you don't remember

23:23.390 --> 23:26.390
tell you the truth I don't remember much
of anything

23:27.140 --> 23:30.170
the mountain can do that to you

23:30.170 --> 23:33.920
it's the air it's different up here so
what

23:34.429 --> 23:37.820
how did you find this place I live here

23:37.819 --> 23:43.189
nobody knows about it better than I do
well great because i have no idea where

23:43.190 --> 23:45.230
we are 90 directions up to the crater

23:45.230 --> 23:50.450
I can't believe you're just gonna leave
me here after last night I would throw

23:50.450 --> 23:57.830
over last night what happened last night
you don't remember that either you are

23:57.829 --> 24:00.449
in a bad way

24:00.450 --> 24:02.650
yeah

24:02.650 --> 24:08.200
I was hoping you were gonna come to me
down the mountain

24:08.200 --> 24:11.200
I mean you would want me to follow more
holes now which you don't know

24:11.950 --> 24:22.509
oh yeah I wouldn't look I i was really
hoping to get up to see the Creator

24:22.509 --> 24:24.759
since you know the mountain

24:24.759 --> 24:27.849
maybe we could go together

24:27.849 --> 24:32.139
it's too far just we were better off
going down the mountain

24:32.140 --> 24:35.140
it's really really important to me

24:36.970 --> 24:42.009
I was that it's okay

24:44.250 --> 24:47.410
don't worry a little like

24:47.410 --> 24:50.410
quick undertaking

24:56.558 --> 25:04.178
did you have something in mind for
safety that's all very impressive

25:04.179 --> 25:08.798
are you this shiftless with every woman
you meet I'm a lifeguard it comes with

25:08.798 --> 25:09.759
the territory

25:09.759 --> 25:13.659
you know these terms have been a lot of
mandala

25:14.169 --> 25:17.230
legend has it they act as a warning of
further eruptions

25:17.230 --> 25:20.710
I really think we should be going down
both of us

25:21.220 --> 25:30.129
look I'm not gonna be scared away by
some half-assed legend ok so just

25:30.128 --> 25:34.689
stubbornness come with the territory as
well I guess it must

25:38.109 --> 25:41.139
yeah

25:43.740 --> 25:47.069
I think I'll go outside for some air

25:47.069 --> 25:50.609
oh my ankle ok

25:50.609 --> 25:54.119
I think it's broken oh oh damn oh

26:00.859 --> 26:02.199
how

26:02.200 --> 26:05.590
it's not broken it's a sprain and worse

26:05.589 --> 26:10.179
well I can't walk on it so now you'll
have to take me down the mountain

26:14.179 --> 26:17.960
Sarah Kay color

26:18.528 --> 26:21.528
thank you so much for coming

26:24.299 --> 26:27.440
so what's going on

26:27.440 --> 26:30.360
um

26:30.359 --> 26:40.589
it's john he still won't have the
operation of stabilized and for a

26:40.589 --> 26:41.789
vacation you know

26:41.789 --> 26:45.629
yeah you run into the ocean

26:46.200 --> 26:52.830
laughing one more I and in the second
it's all changed

26:52.829 --> 26:59.369
ripped apart the man who could hardly
wait to be a father who loved every

26:59.369 --> 27:01.049
minute of every day now

27:01.049 --> 27:04.769
now he wants to give up you can't let
him Sarah

27:04.769 --> 27:09.329
I know I know but but how do i get to
him

27:09.329 --> 27:12.539
how do i make him a scene that I need
him

27:12.539 --> 27:17.009
no matter what's happened

27:17.009 --> 27:22.769
no matter what the future is can't see
it without him

27:22.769 --> 27:25.589
I guess the only way

27:25.589 --> 27:29.399
to make don't understand to look him in
the eyes

27:30.569 --> 27:33.859
and tell him over and over again

27:33.859 --> 27:36.519
until he believes you

27:36.519 --> 27:39.519
you don't want him to give up sorry

27:43.180 --> 27:46.519
so you shouldn't give up either

27:46.519 --> 27:49.148
keep fighting

27:49.148 --> 27:52.299
fight like hell sister

27:52.299 --> 27:55.359
sometimes that's the only way to wake up
man

27:58.410 --> 28:01.740

best year of my life

to stay together

woman I was going to spend the rest of

30:04.910 --> 30:07.360
my life with

30:07.359 --> 30:13.750
when I saw you here the feelings I had
were feelings of guilt that have let you

30:13.750 --> 30:16.380
go

30:16.380 --> 30:19.380
think confused with how things used to
be

30:20.140 --> 30:21.960
and Luke

30:21.960 --> 30:27.778
what about him just have gone over this

he adored me and I thought that I was in
love with him

I wasn't but by then it was too late

36:43.349 --> 36:47.309
I was already pregnant with Luke and
what was going on between &lt;operand> two

36:47.309 --> 36:48.480
