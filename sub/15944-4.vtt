00:04.300 --> 00:06.933
You're seven weeks out, Paul.
 These won't cut it.

00:06.967 --> 00:10.267
Claude pulled them from
 the last show for a reason.
 He thinks they're shit.

00:10.300 --> 00:13.400
I pulled them.
 This is my house, my name.

00:13.433 --> 00:15.533
-Are you an artist?
-No. I make princesses.

00:15.567 --> 00:18.867
CLAUDE: He knows 
 all about us.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.200
The President's office is 
 searching for a designer

00:21.233 --> 00:23.933
to dress the world,
 starting with Paris.

00:23.967 --> 00:26.833
If your next collection
fails, Monsieur Sabine,

00:26.867 --> 00:28.533
our partnership
 is effectively over

00:28.567 --> 00:30.200
and you will owe me
 everything.

00:30.233 --> 00:32.400
If he's upset about
 ten metres of velvet,

00:32.433 --> 00:34.000
we'll use 15.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.367
For some Godforsaken reason,

00:35.400 --> 00:37.533
your past was more important
 to you than your future

00:37.567 --> 00:39.567
and I had to save
 an embarrassing situation.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.267
By making it
 more embarrassing.

00:41.300 --> 00:42.833
I just wanted to go back.

00:42.867 --> 00:45.100
They didn't even
let me hold him.

00:45.133 --> 00:46.633
The adoption
will soon be formalised.

00:46.667 --> 00:49.133
God has provided a family
 that's well off

00:49.167 --> 00:52.300
and can offer this child
a future.

00:52.333 --> 00:53.733
Nina, what have you done?

00:53.767 --> 00:55.433
I heard you wanted models
 with short hair.

00:55.467 --> 00:57.533
-But you made it clear--
-I changed my mind.

00:57.567 --> 01:00.167
But I won't do it
 on a seamstress's salary.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.567
I told my friends we'd
 meet them at the restaurant.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.933
I'll... see you tomorrow.

01:04.967 --> 01:06.533
Can you think of anybody
who might

01:06.567 --> 01:09.333
judge Monsieur Sabine
 or resent him?

01:09.367 --> 01:10.967
(SCOFFS) Besides his brother.

01:11.067 --> 01:12.567
He was interested in me.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.067
-MOTHER: What does 
 he know about us? 
 -(GROANING)

01:15.067 --> 01:17.833
VICTOR: I just wanted
 to let you know
 it was taken care of.

01:17.867 --> 01:21.533
I don't need to know
 any more about it, Victor.
 Neither does Paul. Ever!

01:21.567 --> 01:23.200
-CLAUDE: What's this?
 -My castle.

01:23.233 --> 01:26.567
-Did you make it yourself?
 -No. One day it
 just showed up.

Where would you like me
to sit? On the radiator?

03:28.600 --> 03:30.600
I wasn't sure
 you'd be attending.

03:30.633 --> 03:33.967
My son is unveiling
 the most important
 collection of his life.

03:34.067 --> 03:35.367
Where would you
expect me to be?

03:35.400 --> 03:37.267
Some place where
you're welcome.

04:04.100 --> 04:07.933
-Where have you been?
 -In my office, drilling
 a hole in the wall...

04:07.967 --> 04:09.467
-with my forehead.
 -Nervous?

04:09.500 --> 04:14.067
No. No, if this is
 a disaster, I can
 just crawl into bed.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.933
Make it big enough for two.

-(CLICKS FINGERS)
-Fire.

04:58.267 --> 05:00.667
I could move this seam.
You would still have
the long waist.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.967
I don't want to sacrifice
the keyhole in the back.

05:03.067 --> 05:05.833
I agree, monsieur,
 but as it is, this will
 require more panels.

05:05.867 --> 05:09.867
-At least a few more metres.
 -But what if we pad the hips?

05:09.900 --> 05:11.467
That would help.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.467
Can I make a suggestion?

05:14.500 --> 05:18.867
If we overlap these two
panels, we could preserve
the silhouette.

05:18.900 --> 05:21.300
But still need more material.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.500
Claude, could you
write that down, please?
Four more metres.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.967
Monsieur.

05:36.067 --> 05:39.533
You have a guest.
 Someone from Meudon.

05:39.567 --> 05:41.467
Excuse me for a moment.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.700
So, Juliette,
if we open up this and...

05:44.733 --> 05:47.400
still... have the panel...

05:47.433 --> 05:50.233
I didn't mean to sneak up
on you. Sorry.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.267
PAUL: There's no need 
 to apologise.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.700
What's this about?

06:02.733 --> 06:06.067
There's been an incident out
 at your cottage, monsieur.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.567
Would you prefer
 we speak in private?

06:07.600 --> 06:10.333
No, this is private enough,
 Inspector. Please, go on.

06:10.367 --> 06:13.833
A body has been found on the
 rear corner of your property.

06:13.867 --> 06:15.667
Buried in a shallow grave.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.100
The victim was male.

06:18.133 --> 06:20.133
He's been out there
 for over a month or so.

06:20.167 --> 06:23.067
Stabbed multiple times,
 possibly an ambush.

06:23.067 --> 06:24.933
Have you been there recently?

06:24.967 --> 06:27.467
I'm four weeks away from
showing a new collection.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.900
I'm... lucky if I make it
to my bed in Paris.

06:30.933 --> 06:34.267
(CHUCKLES)
 I see. Well, erm...

06:34.300 --> 06:36.333
...someone took advantage
of your absence

06:36.367 --> 06:39.833
and thought the kitchen
 garden would be a convenient
 place to park a dead body.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.933
Who found it?

06:41.967 --> 06:43.767
A dog.

06:43.800 --> 06:48.067
Your neighbour's child
 has been using the property
 as her playground.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.833
Your barn is her castle,
so to speak.

06:50.867 --> 06:53.933
-I'm sorry. I'm lost.
 -The corpse was her prisoner.

06:53.967 --> 06:56.500
Evidently the dog dug him up
 and, erm...

06:56.533 --> 07:00.367
the little girl
 was aware of the victim
 for a couple of days

07:00.400 --> 07:03.433
before her mother caught on.
 It's a bit gruesome,
 isn't it?

07:03.467 --> 07:06.200
One can only imagine that
the child was unaffected

07:06.233 --> 07:08.600
because of what she saw
 during the war.

07:09.467 --> 07:11.667
Do you know
 who this... victim is?

07:11.700 --> 07:14.567
We're fairly certain
 that it was a thief

07:14.600 --> 07:17.467
who'd been fleecing our town
 last year.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.933
He went missing
and must have made
the mistake of returning.

07:19.967 --> 07:22.600
Some people... (CHUCKLES)
 ...don't trust the police,

07:22.633 --> 07:24.600
and so they take matters
into their own hands.

07:24.633 --> 07:26.067
My God.

07:26.067 --> 07:28.467
Oh, please, Mr Sabine,
 I assure you

07:28.500 --> 07:31.333
that the countryside isn't
 crawling with savages.

07:31.367 --> 07:35.267
It's just that... we still
 live in a chaotic time.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.367
Is there anything I can do?

07:37.400 --> 07:41.067
Stay away from the property.
 At least for now.

07:41.933 --> 07:44.233
I may have more questions
for you.

07:44.267 --> 07:46.567
Thank you, Inspector.

07:48.667 --> 07:50.067
Mm-mm.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.333
Inspector.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.300
What do you know about this?
 Sit!

08:01.333 --> 08:02.467
Sit!

08:02.500 --> 08:04.267
(LOW CHATTER)

08:08.667 --> 08:10.167
Ugh. It smells rank.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.133
It's not a fragrance, you
 idiot, it's an astringent.

08:13.167 --> 08:15.400
Still wouldn't put that
 on my face.

08:15.433 --> 08:18.300
-It's probably goat piss.
-So what?

08:18.333 --> 08:20.400
The ancient Egyptians
 darkened their eyebrows

08:20.433 --> 08:23.333
using crocodile shit.
 Isn't that right, Nina?

08:23.367 --> 08:25.967
Uh, I've never
 heard that before.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.467
Well, you have now.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.067
But I'm sure you've known
girls who've done worse.

08:30.100 --> 08:33.433
-To attract a man, that is.
 -(GIGGLES)

08:38.567 --> 08:40.332
Where did that come from?

08:41.732 --> 08:42.900
It was a gift.

08:42.933 --> 08:44.900
Fittings are running late,
 ladies.

08:44.933 --> 08:47.500
Monsieur is delayed
 in a meeting.

08:49.233 --> 08:52.067
How are you doing? Have the
 girls made space for you?

08:52.100 --> 08:53.433
Oh, we're thrilled.

08:53.467 --> 08:56.700
Nice to have someone in here
 who can... fix a hem.

08:56.733 --> 09:01.067
She's not working
 in that department
 any more, Dominique.

09:01.067 --> 09:03.400
Take care of yourself
 in this coming month.

09:03.433 --> 09:07.167
Monsieur's given you each
 an advance on your salary.

09:07.200 --> 09:11.133
Put this towards vitamins,
 cosmetics, eating healthy,

09:11.167 --> 09:13.467
whatever it takes
 to keep you swans.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.800
Why, Charlotte,
 you flatter us.

09:15.833 --> 09:18.333
No, I don't. He does.

I've wanted to tell you,
 I've tried to go back twice
 to the cottage,

10:12.300 --> 10:14.467
but your mother said, if that
 little girl's so mean--

10:14.500 --> 10:16.267
My mother?

10:18.500 --> 10:20.633
What does my mother
 have to do with this?

10:20.667 --> 10:22.733
She said he was going
to blackmail the family.

10:22.767 --> 10:24.300
-Who?
 -The sailor.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.000
She wanted him gone.
 She said you would too.

10:28.433 --> 10:30.667
When did my mother
 start speaking for me?

10:30.700 --> 10:33.133
She said the less you knew,
 the more we could
 protect you.

I thought you were
 in the models' cabine.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.067

 you want to keep this.

10:54.933 --> 10:58.567

 -Of course. Thank you.

Well, see you at home, then.

You thought this was...
 the best place to hide
 your stupid mistake?

11:16.333 --> 11:18.600
I tried.

11:18.633 --> 11:22.333
After I dropped your mother
 off, I tried different places
 to get rid of him.

11:22.367 --> 11:26.900
I almost got caught.
 Didn't know where else to go.
 There was no-one out there--

Except a curious dog
and a morbid little girl.

 made much of an impact.

to speak to you?

 you spoke to Maman?

 it's something else.

 needed to feel like
 they were in charge.

with lousy heels.

What? What are you talking
 about? You don't own shoes
 with lousy heels.

-May I?
 -What are you doing?

30:08.167 --> 30:10.333
It's not how Monsieur
 designed it.

30:39.667 --> 30:41.367
(DOOR CLOSES)

30:41.400 --> 30:43.333
HELEN: Hello.

30:43.367 --> 30:46.067
What are you doing here
in the middle of the day?

30:46.100 --> 30:47.967
I had to find some papers.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.767
How was lunch with Marjorie?

30:49.800 --> 30:53.300
Well, if you ever need a new
 press agent, she's your girl.

30:53.333 --> 30:56.033
Is there anyone
she doesn't know?

30:56.067 --> 30:58.567
Her connections may
 come in handy some day.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.333
That day is Friday.

31:01.167 --> 31:04.200
Wait. Papers? For what?

31:04.233 --> 31:08.133
Hm? Oh, there's a situation
 out at the cottage.

31:08.167 --> 31:12.367
A property line dispute.
I've got to go out there.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.633
Now?

31:13.667 --> 31:16.133
They're practically setting
 up chairs in the salon.

31:16.167 --> 31:17.833
They need you here.

31:17.867 --> 31:20.900
Here, give them to me.
 I'll take them.
 Victor can drive me.

31:20.933 --> 31:22.600
No!

31:22.633 --> 31:25.700
Thank you...
 I'll take care of it.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.433
Why are you going
to the cottage?

31:36.733 --> 31:39.333
Just tell me the truth.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.167
The truth is...
I am overwhelmed.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.300
I don't need you to become
 an additional burden.

31:47.733 --> 31:51.233
I'm not a burden.
I'm your wife.

31:52.933 --> 31:55.300
What's going on?

32:02.100 --> 32:04.533
My mother killed that sailor.

32:11.300 --> 32:13.667
I already knew that.

32:15.633 --> 32:18.267
How would you know that?

32:18.300 --> 32:21.467
Let's just say I had my
 suspicions and you just...

32:22.767 --> 32:24.367
...confirmed it.

32:33.233 --> 32:35.067
What are you gonna do now?

32:35.067 --> 32:40.200
I give this detective the
paperwork he's asked for.

32:40.233 --> 32:42.367
Then I'll figure
something out.

32:43.533 --> 32:46.067
Does Claude know?

32:46.067 --> 32:48.233
Please, don't tell him,
 Helen.

32:56.133 --> 32:57.700
Will you do that for me?

33:00.167 --> 33:04.100
Please promise me
he'll never know.

33:28.567 --> 33:31.600
I'm confused.
 Where am I in all this?

33:31.633 --> 33:34.700
I see a lovely spot reserved
 for the other Madame Sabine

33:34.733 --> 33:37.167
but I... I seem to be
 among the missing.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.533
It's still a work in
 progress, madame.

33:39.567 --> 33:41.533
That's why I did it
 in pencil.

33:41.567 --> 33:43.567
Some guests haven't even
responded yet.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.833
Well, here's my response.
I'll be here.

33:45.867 --> 33:50.133
And I'd like my chair to have
 four legs and a back.

33:50.167 --> 33:53.700
I'll certainly pass that on
 to Monsieur.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.767
He's lucky to have you,
 Charlotte.

33:57.800 --> 34:02.367
My son's always gravitated
 towards sharp,
 talented women.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.833
Most men
 find that threatening.

34:04.867 --> 34:07.533
God knows
 I scared off enough.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.667
I bet you have, too.

34:11.067 --> 34:14.067
I've little time to think
of anything but my work.

34:15.167 --> 34:17.600
Good for you. It'll pay off.

34:17.632 --> 34:20.233
I've a good feeling
 about this collection.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.567
Do you?

34:21.600 --> 34:22.900
Oh, yes.

34:22.933 --> 34:25.433
It's in the cards.

34:25.467 --> 34:27.199
Excuse me.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.100
What was their reaction?

34:36.132 --> 34:38.266
-Who?
-The other girls.

34:38.300 --> 34:41.266
When they found out Monsieur
 picked you to be the bride.

34:41.300 --> 34:43.467
Juliette, have you taken
your break yet?

34:43.500 --> 34:45.533
You're functioning
 on very little sleep.

34:45.567 --> 34:47.100
I... I'm nearly done.

34:47.132 --> 34:48.800
I've got it from here. Go.

34:48.833 --> 34:50.367
Eat something.

34:56.199 --> 34:58.300
Have you taken a break?

34:58.333 --> 35:00.467
I don't need a break.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.533
I need this dress
to be perfect.

35:02.567 --> 35:05.067
If you leave it pinned, Mama,
 I could finish the stitching.

35:05.067 --> 35:06.733
That's not a terrible idea.

35:06.767 --> 35:10.767
At least I'd know
 what you were doing
 with your free time.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.100
What does that mean?

35:13.133 --> 35:14.700
What were you thinking?

35:14.733 --> 35:17.633
Sending a donation like that
 to a novice?

35:17.667 --> 35:19.333
What were you after, Nina?

35:19.367 --> 35:22.433
I wanted her to know that
 I was earning more money now.

35:22.467 --> 35:24.233
-That I was in
 a better place.
 -No.

35:24.267 --> 35:26.567
You wanted to bribe her
 for information.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.767
Which only shows how naive
 and foolish you still are.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.833
It wasn't a bribe.

35:30.867 --> 35:33.333
And, anyway, it's none
 of your business.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.767
Really?

35:37.267 --> 35:40.100
Then why was this addressed
 to me and not to you?

35:48.133 --> 35:51.500
-Where's the money?
 -I'll hold on to that.

35:51.533 --> 35:54.400
You don't think things
 through, Nina.

35:55.733 --> 36:00.433
It's my money. I earned it.
 And I want it back.

36:00.467 --> 36:03.267
That child already belongs
 to someone else.

36:03.300 --> 36:06.400
You can't buy back
 what's no longer yours.

36:06.433 --> 36:09.067
And why would you
even want to?

36:09.067 --> 36:12.167
Do you want this,
your costume,

36:12.200 --> 36:14.800
or something that you might
 really wear one day?

36:14.833 --> 36:17.700
No man is interested in
 raising someone else's child.

36:17.733 --> 36:19.200
Think about your future.

36:19.233 --> 36:22.333
I don't know
 what my future holds.

36:22.367 --> 36:25.300
But if you don't start
 letting me make
 my own decisions,

36:25.333 --> 36:28.067
it's not going
 to include you.

36:37.567 --> 36:41.933
Can you think of anyone
 who might want to compromise
 your reputation?

36:41.967 --> 36:45.667
Anyone in particular
 with whom you've had
 a negative encounter

36:45.700 --> 36:48.067
in the last six months?

36:48.067 --> 36:51.900
Inspector, I'm days away
 from what could be
 a turning point in my career.

36:51.933 --> 36:54.867
There may be more
 than one person who'd relish
 my fall from grace.

36:54.900 --> 36:58.233
But I have no personal idea
 of who that might be.

36:58.267 --> 37:00.233
Oh, it sounds like
 quite an event.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.567
Could there be
 an extra seat for me?

37:10.500 --> 37:12.500
(LOW CHATTER)

37:14.567 --> 37:18.367

 What did you do?

37:20.067 --> 37:23.100
-I was only gone for 15--
-Were you asleep
when you stitched this?

37:23.133 --> 37:24.533
I used the navy thread
 so it--

37:24.567 --> 37:27.433
I don't give a damn about
 the colour. It's about pride.

37:27.467 --> 37:28.833
Workmanship.

37:28.867 --> 37:30.667
We are not sewing flour bags.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.567

 -This isn't a school!

37:32.600 --> 37:36.167

 your stupid foolish mistakes!

37:37.767 --> 37:41.100
What are you looking at?
 Is that panel finished yet?

38:06.500 --> 38:07.633

38:07.667 --> 38:10.367
Didn't expect you to be back
 until tomorrow.

38:10.400 --> 38:13.233
-What's that?
 -A source of conflict.

38:13.267 --> 38:15.067
I have three different
 seating charts

38:15.067 --> 38:18.533
and your mother wants to be
 front and centre
 on every one of them.

38:18.567 --> 38:21.300
She also insisted
 on trying on the same suit

38:21.333 --> 38:23.300
that Marjorie plans on
 wearing to the show.

38:23.333 --> 38:26.233
And did you tell her
 that suit and that seat
 were already taken?

38:26.267 --> 38:29.367
I tried, but she insists on
 wearing black and white.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.433
She says,
 "It's in the cards."

38:33.767 --> 38:35.367
Will you join me?

38:36.667 --> 38:38.267
Thank you.

38:46.300 --> 38:49.533
If we locked Marjorie and my
 mother in the same room
 with one dress,

38:49.567 --> 38:53.100
who do you think
 would come out wearing it?

38:53.133 --> 38:56.633
I think Marjorie would have
 the top half and your mother
 would have the bottom.

-Hm?

-With that detective?
 -Oh, that.

39:27.133 --> 39:31.367
It's all taken care of. It
 was just a misunderstanding.
 I've cleared it up.

Nina, you should get changed.
 Can somebody help her?
 Please!

49:47.200 --> 49:50.933
Ohhh, stop!
 Take it from the petticoat.

-PAUL: What are we gonna do?
 -I can hide this in the fold.
 -Claude...

49:55.400 --> 49:58.133
-Just get me the scissors.
 -Here.

49:58.167 --> 50:00.767
I'll tack it back to the...

Bravo!

51:48.700 --> 51:52.567
Thank you. Thank you.

PAUL: You're a natural.
 Have fun.

53:17.900 --> 53:21.267
-Monsieur Trouvier
 seemed impressed.
 -A little shocked.

53:21.300 --> 53:24.733
-Ah...
 -Congratulations...

53:24.767 --> 53:29.167
Ashes and gloom are over,
darling. Romance is back.

53:29.200 --> 53:31.633
Now, Mr Sabine
 has given us a new look

53:31.667 --> 53:34.367
and I'm sure as hell
 ready to wear it. (LAUGHS)

53:34.400 --> 53:37.600
-You can write that down.
-MAN: So what exactly
inspired you?

53:37.633 --> 53:41.067
I'd like to say that it all
 starts with the sleeve,
 monsieur,

53:41.067 --> 53:42.733
but I'm afraid
 it's just not true.

53:42.767 --> 53:45.900
It starts with the type of
 woman you want to design for.

53:45.933 --> 53:48.067
You certainly found
 your muse.

53:48.967 --> 53:51.167
No, the muse is my wife.

53:58.267 --> 54:00.700
-Where's Claude?
-I don't know.

54:00.733 --> 54:04.800
I hope, wherever he is,
 he's celebrating, too.

54:04.833 --> 54:06.967
CLAUDE: So won't your 
 lady friend be missing you?

54:07.067 --> 54:10.633
No. She has other things
to distract her.

54:11.667 --> 54:14.100
Champagne, gossip...

54:14.933 --> 54:17.467
...free food.

54:17.500 --> 54:20.833
And should she come looking
 for you, do you have a name?

54:20.867 --> 54:22.700
Cesar.

54:22.733 --> 54:24.367
You?

54:25.600 --> 54:27.267
Claude.

54:28.933 --> 54:31.067
What's this?

54:34.700 --> 54:36.767
I don't recall
 seeing this one.

54:40.067 --> 54:42.400
That's because
 you were looking at me.

Who are they?

55:21.233 --> 55:23.100
I beg your pardon?

55:23.133 --> 55:26.433
The tardy couple who nearly
 missed the first dress.
 How do we know them?

55:26.467 --> 55:28.533
I don't.

55:37.867 --> 55:39.300
Monsieur.

55:43.367 --> 55:45.567
I didn't know
 you were still here.

55:45.600 --> 55:48.200
I... wanted to talk
 to Nina but...

55:48.233 --> 55:51.667
there's so many people around
 her, I thought I'd wait.

55:51.700 --> 55:54.400
Monsieur has invited her
to a small after-party.

55:54.433 --> 55:57.300
Right. Of course.

55:57.333 --> 56:00.067
Well, I'll see her
 on Monday, then.

56:00.100 --> 56:02.233
If you still want me
 to come in.

56:02.267 --> 56:04.167
You'd better be here.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.333
The real work
 is about to begin.

56:08.067 --> 56:10.367
We'll be doing Nina's work,
 too.

56:11.667 --> 56:13.567
It's just us, now, Juliette.

56:21.267 --> 56:23.500
Can I walk to the metro
 with you?

56:25.133 --> 56:27.267
Yes, I'd like that.

56:29.700 --> 56:30.867
Jules.

56:30.900 --> 56:33.633
Ah. Just the man
I'm looking for.

56:34.467 --> 56:37.100
-You were looking for me?
-Yes.

56:37.133 --> 56:39.133
I wanted to speak to you
in private

56:39.167 --> 56:44.367
but I wouldn't dare interrupt
 your legion of admirers.

56:44.400 --> 56:46.533
Excuse me.

56:48.133 --> 56:49.900
Are you one of them?

56:49.933 --> 56:53.700
Well, let's see
 if all this enthusiasm

56:53.733 --> 56:56.200
translates to sales, hm?

56:56.233 --> 56:58.533
Enjoy your moments.

56:58.567 --> 57:01.267
They never get as good
 as this again.

57:02.233 --> 57:05.300
We'll talk soon. Hm?

57:23.767 --> 57:26.767
Ah. So you're out here.

57:30.567 --> 57:33.800
So that could have gone
 either way, huh?

57:33.833 --> 57:36.500
The wedding dress.

57:36.533 --> 57:40.800
I guess that's what separates
 mere dressmakers
 from Paul Sabine.

57:56.667 --> 58:00.733
I never properly thanked you.
 For the lovely card.

58:00.767 --> 58:03.067
(SCOFFS) Oh, please.
 That was nothing.

58:06.500 --> 58:09.533
Why, uh... Vivien Leigh?

58:09.567 --> 58:14.567
I mean, there's a lot
of beautiful movie stars.

58:14.600 --> 58:18.500
A few of them were downstairs
 tonight, admiring you.

58:18.533 --> 58:23.067
-What is it about her--
 -She has fire in her eyes.

58:23.067 --> 58:25.767
But she's not willing to
admit when she's afraid.

58:29.500 --> 58:32.467
Are you? Afraid?

58:37.567 --> 58:39.600
I know I am. (CHUCKLES)

Once the master finds out

58:43.567 --> 58:47.667
that it was my light that
torched that dress, uh...

58:47.700 --> 58:49.933
...I'm guessing my days here
 are pretty much numbered.

58:49.967 --> 58:52.200
It was an accident.

58:52.233 --> 58:54.233
It was a pricy one.

58:54.267 --> 58:56.333
About two months' wages.

58:57.667 --> 59:00.067
I'll leave Paris owing him.

59:04.267 --> 59:08.833
I don't know. Maybe
everything happens for
a reason, though, right?

59:08.867 --> 59:12.133
I didn't know
 what I was looking for
 when I came here but...

59:14.667 --> 59:17.067
...I certainly know
 what I'm leaving with.

59:19.800 --> 59:22.067
