01:18.537 --> 01:19.830
Did you sleep?

01:20.914 --> 01:21.999
Are you all right?

01:25.627 --> 01:26.753
I tried to wake him.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.027
He's cold.

02:02.080 --> 02:06.418
Tell-- Tell Mr. Edwards no one's come.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.086
Is it time to wake up?

02:08.169 --> 02:09.880
Wank club's waking the whole world, is it?

02:10.881 --> 02:12.090
Jesus Christ.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.926
I was dreaming I was lying
in my own bed last night.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.969
Hey, Alf, hand me my bag.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.054
Get up!

02:19.431 --> 02:20.766
How is Mr. E?

02:21.433 --> 02:22.434
He's cold.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.238
-Hey. Catch this.
-I'm so tired.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.199
I need to brush my teeth.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.673
Oi, is he awake?

02:54.883 --> 02:57.135
-He's--
-He didn't look good…

02:57.219 --> 02:58.387
-He's…
-Is he healed?

02:58.470 --> 03:00.180
He needs an ambulance.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.725
He's…

03:03.809 --> 03:06.186
-Bro, is he healed?
-Look, call an ambulance.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.354
He's dead.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.444
Mr. Edwards is dead.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.210
Aneesha?

06:01.737 --> 06:03.906
Why is Daddy sleeping on the floor?

06:04.615 --> 06:06.241
Maybe his back hurts.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.160
Then shouldn't he be on the bed?

06:09.328 --> 06:11.038
Maybe he doesn't wanna be there.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.292
Are Mommy and Daddy getting divorced?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.294
No. They're not allowed.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.714
What's this?

06:20.797 --> 06:22.841
Stop. That's mine. I found it.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.885
-Where?
-I just found it.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.179
And it's mine, so don't ever touch it.

06:27.846 --> 06:28.847
All right.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.520
When are we going home?

06:34.603 --> 06:37.564
I don't know.
I know we're gonna drive north.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.776
Please be sure to get
all your personal belongings…

06:40.859 --> 06:43.278
No way they're bombing here.
We're in the middle of bumblefuck.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.531
Yeah, but what if it's not a bomb?
What if it's nuclear?

06:45.614 --> 06:47.574
…once you've checked out.

06:47.658 --> 06:48.825
This is too big for ISIS.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.078
Gas lines blowin' up,
hospitals shutting down…

06:51.161 --> 06:53.622
-Hospitals?
-Power's out, equipment's fried.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.165
Fuckin' Putin, man.

06:55.249 --> 06:58.919
Attention!
Due to a declared federal emergency,

06:59.002 --> 07:02.756
Centre, Blair and Clinton counties
are ordered to evacuate.

07:03.298 --> 07:07.261
Guardsmen will be stationed along
major highways to ensure your safety.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.806
Mommy, what was he saying?

07:10.889 --> 07:12.975
Nothing, sweetie.
He's just giving directions.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.228
Now, sit back so I can buckle you in.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.855
It's too tight.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.690
-Luke, help your sister.
-I repeat…

07:19.773 --> 07:21.733
It's supposed to be tight.
That's the point.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.777
But it's hurting my neck.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.320
It's keeping you safe.

07:25.404 --> 07:27.239
…counties are ordered to evacuate.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.699
Safe from what?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.701
Guardsmen
will be stationed along major highways

07:30.784 --> 07:31.910
to ensure your safety.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.997
I repeat.
Due to a declared federal emergency…

07:35.080 --> 07:36.081
I'll be back.

07:36.164 --> 07:39.710
…Centre, Blair, and Clinton counties
are ordered to evacuate.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.548
I don't--

07:52.139 --> 07:53.473
Stop it!

07:54.349 --> 07:55.601
You stop.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.980
It's my backpack. It's not yours.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.068
Hey!

08:09.448 --> 08:12.409
Please let go of this and give me.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.827
No, it's mine.

08:27.132 --> 08:30.427
-Yes, you are.
-It belongs to me. Stop it.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.972
-Stop acting silly.
-You stop.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.684
-You're the one acting silly.
-You are.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.102
That is yours.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.813
-This is mine.
-This is mine.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.817
This is mine.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.795
Hands off it. Stop!

09:04.878 --> 09:07.965
-Why don't you stop?
-I'm not doing anything.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.639
Stop it.

09:20.394 --> 09:23.021
Mommy, why are you locking the door?

09:23.105 --> 09:24.648
Mom? Mom?

09:25.232 --> 09:27.317
-Mom?
-Why are you locking the door?

09:35.659 --> 09:37.953
They say the highway's open.
We can head north.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.458
You lock yourself in for protection?

09:55.012 --> 09:56.096
That's you.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.608
Hey!

10:08.317 --> 10:09.818
How much farther, man?

10:14.281 --> 10:15.866
How far is Dishu?

10:16.533 --> 10:17.534
Dishu?

10:21.663 --> 10:23.874
Hey! Where are we?

10:26.001 --> 10:27.419
Where the fuck is this?

10:29.713 --> 10:30.756
What?

10:43.185 --> 10:44.186
What?

11:06.917 --> 11:08.335
Hey!

11:08.418 --> 11:09.878
Help. Find.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.088
What the fuck is this?

11:13.507 --> 11:16.635
What? You led me around
for two fucking days

11:16.718 --> 11:18.929
looking for fucking goats? Goats?

11:20.722 --> 11:23.100
You were supposed to help me find my men!

11:23.976 --> 11:24.977
Fuck!

11:26.436 --> 11:28.981
I need to find my me--

11:29.982 --> 11:30.983
Fuck.

11:32.568 --> 11:33.735
Fuck!

11:34.236 --> 11:35.612
Find--

11:37.030 --> 11:38.031
Fuck!

11:45.539 --> 11:46.540
Chavez.

12:00.679 --> 12:03.682
The video file might have been damaged.

12:03.765 --> 12:04.766
Damaged?

12:06.810 --> 12:08.770
All the astronauts saw something.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.649
Something actually collided
with the shuttle.

12:12.733 --> 12:16.695
There was no evidence
of any object detected near the shuttle.

12:17.196 --> 12:19.823
Japanese satellites
did not detect anything either.

12:19.907 --> 12:23.202
You know they would detect
even the fastest comets or meteors.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.745
What about international satellites?

12:24.828 --> 12:28.582
The Americans and British have been
preoccupied with the terrorist attacks.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.918
However, if they did detect something,

12:31.001 --> 12:33.003
they surely would have reported that
ahead of time.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.925
Perhaps it was space debris.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.178
Even a small object
could cause an explosion.

12:41.803 --> 12:42.804
Space debris?

12:43.805 --> 12:46.391
It was something bigger.
Just look at the footage.

12:46.475 --> 12:47.476
We did.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.022
Kaito agrees with me.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.027
Is that right, Kaito?

13:00.280 --> 13:03.534
Well, I thought it might have been
a glitch in the video feed.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.287
Or maybe it could have been space debris.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.794
Yamato-san,
you're lucky you haven't been arrested.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.797
Leave, now.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.633
If you ever set foot in here again,
you'll be going to prison.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.052
Do you understand?

13:27.766 --> 13:28.851
Idiots.

13:31.103 --> 13:32.104
Mitsuki!

13:33.939 --> 13:34.940
Mitsuki.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.817
Mitsuki.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.151
Space debris?

13:38.652 --> 13:40.153
I would've been fired too.

13:40.237 --> 13:43.657
Something crashed into
and put a hole through the shuttle!

13:47.035 --> 13:48.287
Nice work today.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.582
What, you think somebody attacked it then?

13:51.665 --> 13:55.002
Well, New York and London were attacked,
weren't they? Why not the Hoshi?

13:55.085 --> 13:57.546
An attack above the atmosphere? By who?

13:57.629 --> 13:58.964
Somebody.

13:59.548 --> 14:01.717
-Something attacked the Hoshi.
-Something?

14:03.093 --> 14:04.928
Hinata said "something."

14:05.012 --> 14:06.680
She did.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.433
It might have been a clue. She might have
been trying to tell me something.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.811
They died instantaneously.
It had to have been some kind of glitch.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.732
It was Hinata.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.694
There's no question.

14:40.964 --> 14:45.219
Mr. Edwards. Mr. Edwards. It's me.

14:47.513 --> 14:48.514
Mr. Edwards.

14:51.517 --> 14:52.518
Mr. Edwards.

14:58.899 --> 14:59.900
Mr. Edwards?

15:05.155 --> 15:07.241
Mr. Edwards? It's me, Poppy.

15:09.618 --> 15:10.619
Mr. Edwards?

15:11.537 --> 15:14.122
No one's coming. We're fucked!

15:14.206 --> 15:15.666
Shit. The fire's out.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.212
We're completely alone.

15:21.338 --> 15:22.798
Still no phones working.

15:25.843 --> 15:30.013
Help! Help! Help!

15:32.975 --> 15:34.309
Anybody!

15:37.604 --> 15:38.981
Sort him out, bruv.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.065
One bag a day.

15:40.566 --> 15:41.984
-That's rations.
-What the hell, man?

15:42.067 --> 15:46.196
A day? How many days will it be
until we die?

15:46.989 --> 15:49.783
It's been a day.
Nobody's dying unless I say so.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.076
Everybody's dying!

15:52.578 --> 15:54.788
And, look, if we can't eat, we have to go.

15:54.872 --> 15:57.499
Even if it is, like,
a hundred miles to the nearest Tesco,

15:57.583 --> 15:59.585
-we have to get help and tell someone.
-Look!

16:00.294 --> 16:01.378
We said we'd stay!

16:02.462 --> 16:03.589
-Tell him, M.
-Until when?

16:04.590 --> 16:06.967
How do we know they're gonna find us?
They'd have come by now.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.761
Like you'd know. We stay here.

16:09.845 --> 16:11.221
He's died 'cause we've stayed.

16:12.723 --> 16:15.767
-We tried to--
-I say we stay, we stay.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.060
You're not in charge of us.

16:19.563 --> 16:20.564
What you say?

16:21.398 --> 16:22.816
I said…

16:24.067 --> 16:25.611
you're not in charge of us.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.529
Jesus.

16:27.613 --> 16:29.281
-Leave him.
-Stop.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.532
I take it back.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.955
I take my vote back for you.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.085
So you're not in charge anymore.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.264
It's your fault we're down here, remember?

16:56.475 --> 16:59.353
Just like it's your fault
your mum's in her chair.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.027
Sorry, was that a secret?

17:08.487 --> 17:09.695
Yeah.

17:10.364 --> 17:11.365
Yeah.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.784
This little wanker just watched

17:13.867 --> 17:16.537
his old man toss his mum
down a flight of steps.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.709
He watched while she broke her back.

17:25.838 --> 17:27.130
He didn't even try and help.

17:27.631 --> 17:28.632
Did you?

17:43.522 --> 17:45.232
-Yo, where you going?
-You all right?

17:45.941 --> 17:47.067
-Yo, Caspar.
-What's he doing?

17:47.150 --> 17:48.193
What the hell?

17:49.653 --> 17:51.238
-Yo. Where you going?
-What's he doing?

17:52.239 --> 17:53.240
Yo, Caspar!

17:53.323 --> 17:54.324
Oi!

17:55.325 --> 17:56.618
Yo, Caspar!

18:00.455 --> 18:01.582
Pathetic.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.750
-What's he doing?
-What's he doing?

18:04.334 --> 18:06.003
He's-- He's going for the road.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.060
Come on, guys.

18:35.699 --> 18:36.950
Look, he's doing it.

18:39.369 --> 18:40.913
He's gotta be careful.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.290
The National Guard is scared.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.210
I heard someone say Boston's gone.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.754
They said no one's heard anything.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.090
There's a curfew now.

19:36.552 --> 19:37.678
You stop.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.137
I have to pee.

19:39.221 --> 19:42.140
We were just at a motel with a bathroom.
Why didn't you pee there?

19:42.224 --> 19:45.060
-I didn't have to pee then.
-We aren't stopping now, buddy.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.395
You have to hold it.

19:47.145 --> 19:49.940
He said heading to Canada's
the right move. Yeah.

19:50.524 --> 19:52.734
Daddy. Look, people over there.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.363
Don't stop.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.157
Hey! Over here.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.909
-Over here!
-They need help.

20:00.993 --> 20:02.244
Hey! Hey!

20:02.327 --> 20:04.663
-I really have to go.
-Don't stop.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.671
-Why didn't we stop?
-We can't stop, baby. Okay?

20:12.754 --> 20:14.047
I have to.

20:15.465 --> 20:16.466
How about Jayden?

20:17.968 --> 20:19.303
I have to pee! Stop!

20:20.637 --> 20:22.931
No. Olivia.

20:23.432 --> 20:25.267
-You're the one being stupid.
-Aneesha?

20:25.350 --> 20:26.351
No.

20:26.852 --> 20:29.605
-Beckett.
-I really have to go.

20:29.688 --> 20:31.857
-Aneesha, what are you doing?
-Madison?

20:31.940 --> 20:33.567
-Theo.
-What are you doing?

20:33.650 --> 20:35.485
-Mom.
-Baby names.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.906
Just thinking of baby names.

20:38.989 --> 20:40.282
Mom!

20:40.365 --> 20:41.450
Mommy!

20:41.533 --> 20:44.369
-Helping you think of baby names.
-I have to pee!

20:59.384 --> 21:00.385
Go pee.

21:00.886 --> 21:01.887
Go!

21:05.849 --> 21:06.850
Aneesha?

21:06.934 --> 21:08.727
You're not part of this family anymore.

21:08.810 --> 21:11.104
-Listen to me--
-A child?

21:11.188 --> 21:12.189
It was an accident.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.815
Are you kidding me?

21:13.899 --> 21:15.234
-We didn't mean to--
-To what?

21:15.317 --> 21:17.444
You didn't mean to fuck her
without protection?

21:17.528 --> 21:20.030
-Aneesha. What's the matter with you?
-Go.

21:20.614 --> 21:23.283
Leave. You can hitchhike
with that family back there.

21:23.367 --> 21:25.911
You know, the wife looked cute.

21:25.994 --> 21:30.040
You can maybe knock her up too.
Start a new civilization.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.875
-You don't make that decision.
-Mommy!

21:31.959 --> 21:33.585
-No, you did.
-Mommy!

21:33.669 --> 21:35.838
-It wasn't an accident. It was a choice.
-Mommy!

21:35.921 --> 21:38.090
-And now you've gotta live with it.
-Okay.

21:38.173 --> 21:40.843
-Just like the rest of us.
-Okay. All right, Aneesha.

21:40.926 --> 21:44.429
-All right. I got you. All right.
-Luke's gone!

21:45.472 --> 21:46.598
Luke?

21:48.392 --> 21:49.518
-Luke!
-Luke!

21:52.312 --> 21:53.397
Luke!

21:55.732 --> 21:56.733
Luke!

21:58.986 --> 21:59.987
Luke!

22:01.446 --> 22:02.447
Luke!

22:02.531 --> 22:03.532
Luke!

22:05.784 --> 22:06.785
Luke!

22:08.161 --> 22:09.329
Luke!

22:13.542 --> 22:14.668
Luke!

22:40.861 --> 22:42.029
Come on, Casp.

23:05.219 --> 23:06.386
He's going for the road.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.063
If that little git can make it up,
we all can.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.632
Is this Murai-san?

25:08.425 --> 25:10.886
My name is Mitsuki Yamato,

25:10.969 --> 25:13.847
an administrator who worked
with Hinata-san at JASA.

25:14.598 --> 25:16.642
May I come in?

25:34.743 --> 25:37.079
I'm coming in.

25:42.376 --> 25:44.837
Please, make yourself at home.

26:16.535 --> 26:19.037
Next is news from India.

26:19.746 --> 26:23.041
A number of reports are coming in
that Mumbai has been attacked.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.376
EVEN MORE ATTACKS WORLDWIDE

26:24.459 --> 26:27.462
And a large-scale explosion
was reported in the heart of the city.

26:28.046 --> 26:29.423
According to our sources,

26:29.506 --> 26:33.343
suspicions of Pakistan's government
being involved in the explosions,

26:33.427 --> 26:36.138
as well as the possibility
of terrorist group involvement, are--

26:37.848 --> 26:43.604
Furthermore, governments worldwide,
the UK, France, America, and Brazil,

26:43.687 --> 26:48.650
are experiencing
large-scale power outages…

27:15.010 --> 27:16.512
Murai-san.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.853
You're crying too much.

27:27.940 --> 27:28.941
Yes.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.567
No, I'm sorry.

27:32.236 --> 27:36.698
I saw the people
leaving flowers and wailing,

27:36.782 --> 27:38.075
collapsing at Shibuya Crossing.

27:38.158 --> 27:42.579
I think she would laugh if she saw them.
They look ridiculous.

27:42.663 --> 27:44.998
Hinata would be laughing it up.

27:47.417 --> 27:48.961
She would.

27:55.050 --> 27:58.720
Did she ever talk about me? Her old man?

28:03.016 --> 28:07.938
No, we weren't all that close.

28:09.648 --> 28:12.150
We hadn't spoken in three years.

28:13.110 --> 28:17.698
Before that,
we talked about our varying opinions.

28:17.781 --> 28:21.618
I disagreed with her choices.

28:22.327 --> 28:25.163
I asked her
who on Earth she thought she was.

28:25.706 --> 28:28.417
She grew to despise my ideas,
said I was too rigid.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.963
But I was right.

28:40.137 --> 28:41.889
May I use your bathroom?

30:32.165 --> 30:33.166
Oh, fuck.

30:44.845 --> 30:47.514
Fuck. Oh, shit.

31:10.037 --> 31:11.747
Where are you, Chavez?

31:13.165 --> 31:14.416
Where are you?

31:15.209 --> 31:18.253
Shit. Shit.

33:43.398 --> 33:44.399
Fuck.

33:46.443 --> 33:47.444
Hey!

33:48.487 --> 33:49.488
Hands!

33:51.573 --> 33:52.574
Where the fuck is he?

33:53.951 --> 33:56.787
Back against the wall. Against the wall.

33:59.081 --> 34:00.082
What?

34:01.041 --> 34:02.960
Where is he?

34:06.922 --> 34:07.923
Chavez?

34:16.181 --> 34:17.181
Hey, buddy.

34:18.934 --> 34:21.061
Hey. Come on, man.

34:21.895 --> 34:24.523
Come on.
I can't have you die in this place.

34:25.190 --> 34:28.652
Hey, come on. Come on.
You're not gonna go out like this.

34:29.152 --> 34:30.362
You're a frogman.

34:31.154 --> 34:34.241
Come on, Chavez.
There you go. There you are.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.201
Hey, hey, you good?

34:38.829 --> 34:41.373
Where were you, man?
I couldn't find any of you.

34:41.456 --> 34:44.543
-I woke up and I couldn't find any of you.
-Trev, I don't know what happened.

34:46.545 --> 34:47.920
I can't feel my leg.

34:48.005 --> 34:49.590
What happened? What?

34:51.967 --> 34:53.302
Hey.

34:54.094 --> 34:56.179
You look great. Okay?

34:58.015 --> 34:59.600
Hey, back the fuck up.

35:00.934 --> 35:02.853
Back up. Why the fuck is he down here?

35:03.729 --> 35:06.064
-For protection.
-I don't know her.

35:07.065 --> 35:08.358
Here. Hey, drink this.

35:08.442 --> 35:09.985
Have some water, okay?

35:11.195 --> 35:12.905
Here you go. Here you go.

35:12.988 --> 35:14.198
Easy, easy, easy.

35:24.374 --> 35:25.375
You saw that, right?

35:27.878 --> 35:30.797
Yeah. Yeah, I saw that shit.

35:32.216 --> 35:34.384
-What the fuck was that, man?
-I don't fucking know.

35:34.468 --> 35:36.553
I have no fucking idea,
but I'm gonna get you home.

35:36.637 --> 35:37.971
You ready?

35:38.055 --> 35:39.181
-Yo, Trev?
-Yo?

35:41.308 --> 35:43.352
I ain't the only one who needs to go home.

35:56.031 --> 35:57.115
Stay the fuck back.

35:59.618 --> 36:02.329
You attack a school. Why do this?

36:09.711 --> 36:12.506
You took everything from us. Everything.

36:13.757 --> 36:15.926
-You kill children.
-Don't fuckin' say that shit.

36:18.136 --> 36:19.221
You called fighters?

36:19.304 --> 36:20.639
You brought them here.

36:26.603 --> 36:27.688
Fuck! Turn around. Let's go!

36:31.441 --> 36:34.778
Luke! Luke!

36:38.574 --> 36:41.910
Luke! I'm sorry!

36:43.579 --> 36:45.247
We're both sorry!

36:52.087 --> 36:53.505
Luke, are you out there?

36:58.844 --> 37:00.053
Luke!

37:13.317 --> 37:15.110
Guys, this isn't from the bus.

37:15.611 --> 37:16.695
Obviously not.

37:21.200 --> 37:23.827
-Wait, Poppy, look at this.
-What is this?

37:23.911 --> 37:25.412
Metal raining from the sky.

37:32.085 --> 37:33.754
This must have hit the bus.

37:34.922 --> 37:36.215
Caspar.

37:37.090 --> 37:38.926
It wasn't your fault, the crash.

37:40.010 --> 37:41.386
Yeah.

37:41.470 --> 37:42.471
Yeah.

37:43.722 --> 37:44.932
No shit.

37:45.015 --> 37:47.601
Oi, Monty.
I think you owes my boy an apology.

37:47.684 --> 37:48.685
You think I care?

37:48.769 --> 37:50.771
-His spaz-out--
-Looks like something

37:50.854 --> 37:52.689
-blew out of the sky.
-Sorry, is there another word?

37:52.773 --> 37:54.650
-Ouch. It's still hot.
-Seizure.

37:59.696 --> 38:01.532
Darwin, what is it?

38:03.367 --> 38:05.661
Russians. They've been bombing us.

38:05.744 --> 38:08.121
No, it's not a bomb. It's a satellite.

38:08.205 --> 38:10.457
Look. Solar panels and everything.

38:12.125 --> 38:14.586
This must have teared
through the atmosphere.

38:32.855 --> 38:33.856
You okay?

38:38.110 --> 38:39.486
You forgot this.

39:09.766 --> 39:10.976
Wait, you know Russian?

39:11.059 --> 39:12.060
It's nothing.

39:14.521 --> 39:15.522
Sorry, I just…

40:15.165 --> 40:19.628
And at this frequency,

40:19.711 --> 40:21.421
can you make out what I am saying?

40:22.589 --> 40:24.466
I'll miss…

40:29.555 --> 40:35.435
"I'll miss the sunrise."

40:41.942 --> 40:43.485
Are you comfortable?

40:44.987 --> 40:46.613
I'm sorry.

40:50.742 --> 40:56.874
At first, she wanted to be
a radio engineer like me.

40:56.957 --> 40:59.126
Until I started working for JASA.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.713
You worked for JASA?

41:06.800 --> 41:08.886
"Administrator Yamato"?

41:09.928 --> 41:11.180
I get it.

41:12.514 --> 41:14.975
A young woman as an administrator.

41:15.058 --> 41:20.564
But that isn't very common, is it?
Especially not blonde.

41:26.111 --> 41:28.113
It was you, wasn't it?

41:29.573 --> 41:33.118
-What?
-A father knows.

41:40.125 --> 41:45.339
Hinata never mentioned her father.

41:46.548 --> 41:47.633
Never.

41:50.219 --> 41:51.678
Why would she?

41:52.262 --> 41:54.806
A parent like you,
with your rigid thinking…

41:54.890 --> 41:59.811
you want to keep your memories of her
locked up in this room forever,

41:59.895 --> 42:04.358
believing she made the wrong "choice,"
hiding her from the world.

42:04.441 --> 42:05.901
You're disgusting.

42:11.198 --> 42:13.408
Every day when I wake up,
this is what I think about.

42:16.578 --> 42:20.999
I wish it could have been me
on that shuttle.

42:23.460 --> 42:25.420
Every day. Every day.

42:28.549 --> 42:30.050
So if you--

42:30.133 --> 42:31.969
The reason Hinata and I stopped speaking…

42:34.763 --> 42:36.640
isn't because of…

42:38.225 --> 42:41.520
what she told me…

42:44.648 --> 42:46.483
she was hiding.

42:48.068 --> 42:53.031
It's because she continued to hide it
from the rest of the world.

42:54.241 --> 42:55.450
That…

42:56.410 --> 42:58.579
I just couldn't bear that.

43:01.373 --> 43:07.087
She started dating that man
to hide who she was.

43:09.464 --> 43:11.925
These were all choices she made.

43:17.514 --> 43:18.515
But…

43:20.350 --> 43:26.440
it was too painful for me
to keep watching Hinata hiding her heart.

43:33.113 --> 43:34.781
So I'm glad…

43:36.033 --> 43:37.951
she didn't hide it from you.

43:43.165 --> 43:44.833
I'm glad it was you.

43:51.465 --> 43:53.467
So, why are you here?

44:06.688 --> 44:07.689
Luke!

44:08.565 --> 44:09.566
Luke!

44:26.667 --> 44:27.668
Luke!

44:32.422 --> 44:33.423
Hello?

44:35.175 --> 44:37.427
Hello? Please.

44:38.679 --> 44:40.180
-Stop right there.
-Please.

44:43.767 --> 44:46.353
I'm looking for my son. Please.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.775
He's inside. Come on.

44:55.612 --> 44:57.489
-All right. Come on in now.
-Thank you.

45:02.202 --> 45:04.246
Sorry about all of this.
It's not even loaded.

45:04.329 --> 45:08.083
But when society goes to pot
it's always best to look dangerous. Kel?

45:09.001 --> 45:10.335
You know, we don't have any--

45:10.419 --> 45:13.672
Oh, my God! Luke! Oh, my God!

45:13.755 --> 45:15.632
Oh, my God.

45:15.716 --> 45:17.634
You must have been
frightened out of your mind.

45:17.718 --> 45:20.762
We don't have a lot to eat,
but there's cocoa if y'all are cold.

45:20.846 --> 45:22.639
Who's this guy?

45:22.723 --> 45:24.141
-Gabby.
-Who's this guy?

45:24.224 --> 45:27.644
Thank you so much, sir. We'll--

45:27.728 --> 45:28.979
We'll get out of your hair.

45:29.062 --> 45:32.065
No, no, no, no, no.
There's a curfew out there.

45:32.149 --> 45:36.403
There's guardsmen on patrol.
Their guns are loaded.

45:36.486 --> 45:38.447
You don't want to be wandering around
in the dark.

45:38.530 --> 45:40.782
-Yes.
-Thank you. Thank you.

45:41.825 --> 45:43.452
My family thanks you, sir.

45:44.119 --> 45:45.120
-No problem.
-Yeah.

45:50.375 --> 45:52.085
Hey, Kel?

45:52.169 --> 45:53.837
Let's get the spare bedroom set up.

45:55.088 --> 45:57.549
-I'll get pillows and blankets.
-Don't worry about a thing.

45:57.633 --> 45:58.634
Thank you.

46:08.894 --> 46:10.771
Sit down. Sit down.

46:12.564 --> 46:13.732
They're here for you.

46:38.632 --> 46:40.759
Go, go, go, go, go.

46:56.900 --> 46:58.318
Go, go, go, go!

47:14.501 --> 47:15.878
Oh, shit.

47:23.677 --> 47:25.679
I got you.

47:33.937 --> 47:36.440
I got you, boy.

47:52.039 --> 47:53.624
Hey, buddy, you good?

47:54.166 --> 47:55.375
Hey, buddy, you good?

47:56.460 --> 47:57.461
Chavez?

47:59.463 --> 48:00.464
Chavez?

48:07.554 --> 48:08.555
Fuck!

48:09.556 --> 48:10.557
Fuck!

48:12.309 --> 48:13.977
Fuck! Fuck!

48:25.322 --> 48:26.323
Fucker.

48:48.762 --> 48:51.181
Monty's a softy inside, ain't he?

48:51.265 --> 48:52.432
-Fuckin' hell.
-Hey!

48:53.267 --> 48:55.102
Wanna go home to mummy and daddy?

48:55.185 --> 48:56.979
-Wanna get your teeth knocked out?
-Hey!

48:58.647 --> 48:59.648
We're going home.

49:00.274 --> 49:01.567
Nobody's going nowhere.

49:01.650 --> 49:04.111
-There's nothing here.
-I said we stay here.

49:04.194 --> 49:06.989
You're not in charge. You were voted out.

49:08.615 --> 49:10.659
And you steal snacks.

49:13.245 --> 49:14.663
You've already done your worst.

49:16.248 --> 49:17.332
Bloody hell, Monty.

49:17.416 --> 49:18.584
We'll see about that.

49:21.420 --> 49:22.588
Are you okay?

49:41.773 --> 49:43.025
I have three older brothers.

49:45.777 --> 49:46.862
Bigger than you.

49:48.238 --> 49:49.239
A lot bigger.

49:56.371 --> 49:59.374
There's nothing you can do
that ain't been done before.

50:01.919 --> 50:02.920
And worse.

50:04.087 --> 50:05.339
I do like a challenge.

50:05.422 --> 50:07.549
How about we go home, and you stay here?

50:08.050 --> 50:09.635
Problem solved, innit?

50:16.266 --> 50:19.061
Go. See if I fucking care.

50:22.189 --> 50:24.399
Oi! Where you lot going?

50:33.325 --> 50:39.081
I thought, if I ran away,
I could, I don't know…

50:42.584 --> 50:43.919
just stop everything.

50:45.420 --> 50:46.421
Freeze time.

50:48.173 --> 50:51.510
Like everything would stay the way it was
and wouldn't get any worse.

50:53.804 --> 50:55.013
Know what I mean?

50:59.476 --> 51:00.769
Do you ever wanna run away?

51:08.944 --> 51:09.945
No.

51:11.071 --> 51:12.322
But I know what you mean.

51:16.910 --> 51:18.161
We're going to get through this.

51:19.288 --> 51:20.289
Look at me.

51:24.668 --> 51:25.836
All of us?

51:27.588 --> 51:31.466
Hinata said something
in her final moments.

51:33.177 --> 51:34.178
"Wajo."

51:35.512 --> 51:38.348
There's a recording of her final moments?

51:38.432 --> 51:42.144
Yes, the communications record.

51:43.854 --> 51:45.147
I'd like to hear it.

51:49.651 --> 51:51.987
You know how,
when I get really mad at Sarah,

51:52.070 --> 51:57.117
you always say, "She's your sister,"
like that makes it all okay?

51:58.535 --> 52:02.122
It doesn't make it all okay.

52:03.248 --> 52:04.541
I know.

52:06.126 --> 52:08.879
The king is dead. Long live the king.

52:11.548 --> 52:12.549
Forget them. It's fine.

52:14.009 --> 52:15.010
J?

52:24.811 --> 52:27.356
We are going to get through this.

52:28.732 --> 52:29.733
Okay?

52:32.069 --> 52:33.070
Okay.

53:44.224 --> 53:45.475
Wajo.

53:47.060 --> 53:48.228
Wajo.

53:58.739 --> 53:59.740
What do you think?

54:38.862 --> 54:43.408
Does JASA have a bigger sound system?
