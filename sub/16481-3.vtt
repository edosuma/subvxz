00:01.543 --> 00:04.043
<i>Previously on</i> scream queens....
<i>Does this killer wear</i>

00:04.078 --> 00:05.711
<i>A mask with horns and leave</i>
<i>a trail of green slime?</i>

00:05.747 --> 00:06.913
You know who the killer is.

00:06.948 --> 00:08.614
I also know
that there's a connection

00:08.650 --> 00:10.516
<i>To the halloween murders</i>
<i>that happened 30 years ago.</i>

00:10.552 --> 00:11.584
1986.

00:11.619 --> 00:12.785
<i>The entire hospital staff</i>

00:12.820 --> 00:13.953
<i>Was murdered</i>

00:13.988 --> 00:15.388
<i>On halloween night.</i>

00:15.423 --> 00:16.589
Are you guys boning?

00:16.624 --> 00:17.924
I want you back.

00:17.959 --> 00:18.958
Back off chanel.

00:18.993 --> 00:20.226
I'm the recipient of the world's

00:20.261 --> 00:21.427
First complete hand transplant.

00:21.462 --> 00:22.562
Dr. Brock holt

00:22.597 --> 00:24.697
<i>Has the hand of</i>
<i>one of the world's</i>

00:24.732 --> 00:26.699
Most notorious serial killers.

00:26.734 --> 00:28.467
Now you know my secret.

00:28.503 --> 00:30.202
I love you so much,
chanel #5.

00:38.646 --> 00:42.381
Ladies... We have another
serial killer on our hands.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.318
And the killer is...
Number five!

00:45.353 --> 00:47.720
What? Me?
Yes. You.

00:47.755 --> 00:49.589
I think poor, warty tyler here

00:49.624 --> 00:52.792
Probably saw you naked and
gagged, and you were so enraged,

00:52.827 --> 00:54.627
You decided to he had to die.

00:54.662 --> 00:56.562
What are you talking about?
I didn't kill him,

00:56.598 --> 00:58.431
I was with you the whole time!

00:58.466 --> 01:00.499
So? You were with us
a whole lot at kappa house

01:00.535 --> 01:01.934
When folks were getting killed
left and right.

01:01.970 --> 01:04.170
And i'm still convinced
you were responsible

01:04.205 --> 01:06.606
For at least some
of those murders.
You guys.

01:06.641 --> 01:08.240
There's a serial killer
on the loose, and hester said

01:08.276 --> 01:10.109
She had information
about who it might be.

01:10.144 --> 01:11.844
I think we should give in
to her outrageous demands

01:11.879 --> 01:13.179
For discontinued
designer cosmetics

01:13.214 --> 01:14.447
And get her moved
to this hospital.

01:14.482 --> 01:16.949
You idiot!
She'll try to kill us!

01:16.985 --> 01:19.185
Number five is right.
Neckbrace is dangerous.

01:19.220 --> 01:21.287
First, we need to do a little
detective work on our own,

01:21.322 --> 01:23.589
And<i> then</i> we'll go to hester.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.824
all right.

01:24.859 --> 01:26.692
Let's get this body
down to the meat locker.

01:26.728 --> 01:29.161
Last time we tried to hide a lot
of bodies in the meat locker,

01:29.197 --> 01:31.263
Like, every single
one of them got stolen.

01:31.299 --> 01:34.934
What is going on in here?

01:34.969 --> 01:36.936
Chanel #5: Shouldn't we
call the police?
Girls!

01:36.971 --> 01:39.372
This place is called
the c.U.R.E. Institute.

01:39.407 --> 01:42.308
Do you know what
the opposite of cure is? Death!

01:42.343 --> 01:45.778
Now, if word gets out
that we have<i> two</i> dead patients,

01:45.813 --> 01:48.447
At a hospital where the chanels
just happen to be working,

01:48.483 --> 01:51.017
That has the distinctive odor
of another serial killer

01:51.052 --> 01:53.052
On the loose, and we
cannot have that.

01:53.087 --> 01:55.388
Because all my hard work
will be for naught,

01:55.423 --> 01:57.456
They'll come in here
and close this place down,

01:57.492 --> 01:59.492
And i'll die!
Wait, what?

02:01.095 --> 02:02.395
I-i just meant that

02:02.430 --> 02:03.996
I've poured so much
into this place

02:04.032 --> 02:06.198
That if they ever closed it,
i would just die.

02:06.234 --> 02:07.633
Now, come on.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.035
We have to get tyler
into the swamp.

02:09.070 --> 02:10.903
Come on!

02:10.938 --> 02:12.738
Chanel #5: Wait, what? We can't
just throw him in the swamp,

02:12.774 --> 02:14.073
That's, like,
destruction of evidence!

02:14.108 --> 02:15.808
We are not destroying anything.

02:15.843 --> 02:17.843
Swamps preserve things.

02:17.879 --> 02:19.679
She's right. Every week, we hear
another story about somebody

02:19.714 --> 02:22.415
Discovering a perfectly
preserved caveman in a swamp.

02:22.450 --> 02:24.083
You're thinking of a bog.

02:24.118 --> 02:27.053
Okay, fine. I'm glad you took
a class in comparative wetlands.

02:27.088 --> 02:28.754
Maybe you could put in
the same effort

02:28.790 --> 02:30.356
Into figuring out
who the killer is!

02:30.391 --> 02:32.358
It could be any of you.

02:32.393 --> 02:35.027
That's why we have to
dispose of this body.

02:35.063 --> 02:37.997
It will buy us time so
i can solve this internally.

02:38.032 --> 02:41.434
I would just like
to say my good-byes.

02:41.469 --> 02:42.535
Oh, dear god.

02:45.907 --> 02:47.673
Tyler...

02:47.709 --> 02:50.076
I loved you.

02:50.111 --> 02:51.410
Warts and all!

02:54.716 --> 02:57.550
Oh, my god. Did you just
make his corpse barf?

02:57.585 --> 02:59.351
On three. One,

02:59.387 --> 03:00.519
Two...

03:00.555 --> 03:02.521
Three!

03:04.158 --> 03:05.958
All right.
Let's get back inside

03:05.993 --> 03:07.393
Before anybody sees us.

03:09.630 --> 03:11.363
And not a word about
this to<i> anyone</i>

03:11.399 --> 03:12.631
Ever.

03:14.102 --> 03:16.102
I love you, tyler!

03:17.572 --> 03:19.105
gross.

03:19.140 --> 03:20.606
Okay, we get it,
number five.

03:20.641 --> 03:22.742
Another one of your
boyfriends was murdered.

03:22.777 --> 03:24.877
Get over it.

03:55.943 --> 03:57.710
Hot dog!

03:59.547 --> 04:02.081
Anyone around?

04:02.116 --> 04:05.451
Think my jumping frenchman
of maine disorder

04:05.486 --> 04:07.353
Is cured.

04:07.388 --> 04:08.420
Hello?

04:12.960 --> 04:14.860
Oh! Hi there.

04:14.896 --> 04:16.695
This some kind of test?

04:18.499 --> 04:20.533
Fantastic. I honestly don't feel

04:20.568 --> 04:24.036
Any anxiety at all.

04:24.071 --> 04:26.372
I mean, you look very scary,
i'm gonna give you that.

04:26.407 --> 04:28.507
But no,

04:28.543 --> 04:31.443
All i feel is just
happy to be alive

04:31.479 --> 04:34.013
And ready to take on the world.

04:35.416 --> 04:37.216
Oh!

04:37.251 --> 04:39.451
Wow! This is incredible.

04:39.487 --> 04:40.686
I'm transformed...

04:41.823 --> 04:44.156
God! That hurts! Oh!

04:44.192 --> 04:46.058
No, no, no...
Please, please, please...

04:51.332 --> 04:53.599
Oh, god!

05:12.386 --> 05:14.486
Hello, chanels.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.055
Dean munsch.

05:16.090 --> 05:17.823
Hester,

05:17.859 --> 05:19.892
We come to you today
not as adversaries,

05:19.927 --> 05:21.994
Whom you had committed
to an insane asylum

05:22.029 --> 05:24.763
After framing us for a series of
murders that you orchestrated,

05:24.799 --> 05:27.499
But as fellow chanels.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.535
What's with the old
exercise video?

05:29.570 --> 05:31.403
<i>Sweatin' to the oldies 2.</i>

05:31.439 --> 05:33.539
When you leave, they'll
turn the volume way up.

05:33.574 --> 05:36.542
The warden does enjoy
her petty torments.

05:36.577 --> 05:37.910
Someone is targeting
the patients

05:37.945 --> 05:39.545
At the c.U.R.E. Institute.

05:39.580 --> 05:43.249
Two have been murdered,
and a third... Is missing.

05:44.485 --> 05:45.551
He's dead, isn't he?

05:45.586 --> 05:46.719
Of course he's dead.

05:46.754 --> 05:48.721
You know who the killer is,
don't you?

05:48.756 --> 05:50.890
I know who it is
because it's obvious.

05:50.925 --> 05:53.225
The clues are right there
in front of you,

05:53.261 --> 05:56.862
But i'm not gonna answer
any more of your questions

05:56.898 --> 05:58.597
Until you give me what i want.

05:58.633 --> 06:00.699
A transfer to your hospital,
and a room with a view.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.368
you see,

06:02.403 --> 06:05.237
That transfer's
never gonna happen.

06:05.273 --> 06:07.339
You're never gonna
leave this asylum.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.377
But i did acquiesce
to one of your requests.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.445
there it is.

06:13.481 --> 06:16.448
<i>A room with a view,</i> 1985.
Vhs version.

06:16.484 --> 06:17.983
Enjoy it.

06:18.019 --> 06:19.485
Don't toy with me, sluts.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.753
The longer you stall,
the more outrageous

06:20.788 --> 06:22.321
My demands will become.

06:22.356 --> 06:24.790
Now, i insist. You finalize
the purchase in my name

06:24.825 --> 06:27.092
Of a timeshare in cabo san
lucas, where i will enjoy

06:27.128 --> 06:30.262
Six all-expense paid weekends
a year, no blackout dates!

06:30.298 --> 06:31.497
You're insane!

06:31.532 --> 06:32.965
The clock is ticking, munsch!

06:33.000 --> 06:35.267
The killings will
only get worse

06:35.303 --> 06:36.902
Until i get what i want.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.071
Body count is about
to go through the roof.

06:39.106 --> 06:41.073
And from what i hear,

06:41.108 --> 06:44.910
This "green meanie" will make
the red devil look like...

06:44.946 --> 06:46.979
A girl scout.

06:47.014 --> 06:50.015
Please, hester. He's murdered
number five's hideous boyfriend.

06:50.051 --> 06:51.951
Please tell us who it is.

06:51.986 --> 06:55.421
All good things come
to those who wait.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.022
Oh, hester, please!
Hester, help us.

06:57.058 --> 06:58.958
Somebody was killed
at the hospital yesterday,

06:58.993 --> 07:00.793
And you're gonna tell us
who the killer is!

07:00.828 --> 07:03.195
the clues are right
in front of you, chanel!

07:03.230 --> 07:05.464
Oh...

07:05.499 --> 07:07.766
Your skin is looking
a little dry.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.536
Maybe you should try some

07:10.571 --> 07:12.838
Esrun cream.

07:14.375 --> 07:15.975
"esrun cream..."

07:19.480 --> 07:22.047
Oh, what is it?
It's a text.

07:22.083 --> 07:24.817
From chad radwell.

07:24.852 --> 07:27.119
See, he's saying,
"i know who the killer is."

07:27.154 --> 07:30.222
Which means, we didn't have
to come here in the first place.

07:30.257 --> 07:32.891
I hope you rot in here forever.

07:32.927 --> 07:35.194
Girls! Ride is leaving.

07:35.229 --> 07:36.996
Door!

07:42.337 --> 07:45.071
Pretty damning evidence,
is it not?

07:45.107 --> 07:46.573
I-i don't understand...

07:46.608 --> 07:49.042
All this is,
is a file of the man

07:49.077 --> 07:50.310
Who was dr. Brock's
hand transplant.

07:52.014 --> 07:54.881
There's a serial killer
somewhere in this hospital.

07:54.917 --> 07:56.950
He probably had
something to do with that dude

07:56.985 --> 07:58.718
That looks like
the fruit of the looms grapes,

07:58.754 --> 08:01.321
And my good buddy randal
disappearing from said hospital

08:01.356 --> 08:03.456
Without being discharged
or cured.

08:03.492 --> 08:05.625
Dr. Hairline over here

08:05.661 --> 08:08.228
Has the hand
of a deranged serial killer.

08:09.831 --> 08:11.431
We know from every
horror movie ever

08:11.466 --> 08:12.832
About people getting the hand

08:12.868 --> 08:14.434
Of a serial killer
put on their body--

08:14.469 --> 08:15.936
That hand eventually takes over

08:15.971 --> 08:17.270
And starts murdering folks.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.840
There is zero
scientific evidence

08:20.876 --> 08:23.076
Of any transplant recipient
exhibiting behavior

08:23.111 --> 08:25.745
Related to the donor.

08:25.781 --> 08:28.181
Wait, wasn't your hand
doing all that crazy stuff

08:28.216 --> 08:29.783
At the movie theater?
Yes, it was my hand,

08:29.818 --> 08:31.918
But occasionally,
it spasms and sort of

08:31.954 --> 08:34.654
Gives the appearance of,
uh, a life of its own.

08:34.690 --> 08:36.256
But i swear to god,
i would never

08:36.291 --> 08:37.824
Kill anyone with it.

08:37.859 --> 08:39.859
Chanel.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.661
You have no choice
but to reject this man

08:41.697 --> 08:44.664
And that gay, murdering hand,
and start boning me again.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.600
Chanel, before you say anything,
i just want you to know that i'm

08:46.635 --> 08:49.636
The highest paid
sperm donor in the state.
Oh, my sperm?

08:49.671 --> 08:51.371
Are we talking about sperm?
Yeah, we're talking about sperm.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.806
Oh, that's great.
We having a sperm-off?

08:52.841 --> 08:54.107
no.
Oh! Okay.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.342
'cause you know what?
I would win,

08:55.377 --> 08:57.010
Because i banged both women

08:57.045 --> 08:58.011
In this room.

08:58.046 --> 08:59.779
With my sperm!
Enough!

08:59.815 --> 09:02.682
I<i> don't</i> choose you, dr. Brock.

09:02.718 --> 09:04.751
And i<i> don't</i> choose you either,
chad.

09:05.988 --> 09:07.687
I choose me.

09:07.723 --> 09:09.856
Chanel oberlin.

09:09.891 --> 09:11.558
And i am not some
little girl anymore

09:11.593 --> 09:14.060
Who can be easily seduced
by whichever man comes along

09:14.096 --> 09:16.029
And has the most money,

09:16.064 --> 09:17.664
Or is the most rich.

09:17.699 --> 09:20.100
I will date who i want to date.

09:21.403 --> 09:23.069
Thank you.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.838
Does anyone else find it odd

09:24.873 --> 09:26.806
That people started
getting attacked

09:26.842 --> 09:29.309
And disappearing at the same
time chad showed up? I mean,

09:29.344 --> 09:30.777
If there's a killer
amongst us...

09:32.014 --> 09:34.381
I say it's you, chad.
Yeah.

09:35.517 --> 09:36.716
hey.

09:36.752 --> 09:39.219
Listen. Chad is a moron.

09:39.254 --> 09:41.054
I mean, he's probably

09:41.089 --> 09:42.989
The dumbest person i ever met.
And he's definitely

09:43.025 --> 09:44.324
The worst lay i ever had,

09:44.359 --> 09:45.859
But that being said,

09:45.894 --> 09:47.027
He does have a point.

09:47.062 --> 09:49.829
This hospital must stay open.

09:49.865 --> 09:51.831
The work being done here
must continue.

09:51.867 --> 09:53.833
It's very personal to me.

09:53.869 --> 09:57.003
We can allow nothing to deter
patients from coming here,

09:57.039 --> 09:59.773
Including risking them
being scared off

09:59.808 --> 10:02.409
By the possibility--
however remote it may be--

10:02.444 --> 10:04.244
That we have a chief surgeon

10:04.279 --> 10:06.846
Whose hand takes over his body
and starts killing people.

10:06.882 --> 10:09.349
You're not gonna
fire me, are you?

10:09.384 --> 10:12.786
No! You're a brilliant surgeon,
and very easy on the eyes,

10:12.821 --> 10:16.423
But i think we're gonna have
to do something about that hand.

10:16.458 --> 10:18.458
Outstanding.
I will go get my axe.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.861
No, we're not chopping off
his hand in the o.R.

10:21.897 --> 10:23.630
We are gonna look
for a new donor.

10:23.665 --> 10:26.032
Preferably someone
who hasn't been arrested

10:26.068 --> 10:27.767
For multiple murders.

10:27.803 --> 10:29.569
It is that...

10:29.604 --> 10:32.639
Or i'm afraid i'm gonna
have to let you go.

10:34.142 --> 10:38.078
Oh! Ooh, yes! Yes! Aah!

10:38.113 --> 10:39.212
Mm!

10:40.682 --> 10:42.716
Aah!

10:44.086 --> 10:46.386
By my count, that was

10:46.421 --> 10:49.089
The fourth orgasm you've had
since you've been in here.

10:49.124 --> 10:51.091
And my 27th of the day.

10:51.126 --> 10:53.293
And it's 9:00 a.M.
I'm sorry.

10:53.328 --> 10:55.095
I just have
to know your secret.

10:55.130 --> 10:56.596
I am in hell.

10:56.631 --> 10:57.831
That's my secret.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.099
Two months ago,

10:59.134 --> 11:01.401
I was in the middle
of teaching my yoga class,

11:01.436 --> 11:03.903
And as i was coming out
of<i> sirsa padasana,</i>

11:03.939 --> 11:07.307
I had this, like,
spontaneous orgasm.

11:07.342 --> 11:09.242
And i thought it
was funny at first.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.578
And then i had another one
a few minutes later.

11:11.613 --> 11:13.813
And then i had another one
in the locker room.

11:13.849 --> 11:16.616
And then another one in the car
on the ride ho... Oh! Whoa!

11:16.651 --> 11:18.251
Mm! Oh, god!

11:18.286 --> 11:19.619
It won't stop.

11:19.654 --> 11:21.254
It's destroying my life.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.757
My husband left me,
because he immediately realized

11:23.792 --> 11:25.859
That all my orgasms
with him were fake.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.763
I am begging you.
Please make it stop.

11:29.798 --> 11:32.799
I'll do anything.
Remove my vagina, i don't care.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.701
Wait, can you actually do that?

11:34.736 --> 11:36.302
How do you remove
negative space?

11:39.007 --> 11:40.940
I don't know, but that,
that won't be necessary.

11:40.976 --> 11:42.976
Um, you see,
you have what's called

11:43.011 --> 11:45.612
"persistent genital
arousal disorder"

11:45.647 --> 11:48.281
Or pgad.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.617
Have you gone
through menopause or

11:50.652 --> 11:52.619
Had hormonal treatments
recently?

11:52.654 --> 11:54.687
They're known to be the cause.

11:54.723 --> 11:56.122
No, nothing like that, um...

11:56.158 --> 11:57.891
I-i don't do drugs or drink

11:57.926 --> 11:59.692
Or anything.
Okay.

11:59.728 --> 12:02.195
It's very hard to determine
what causes the disorder.

12:02.230 --> 12:04.564
But it doesn't really matter
in terms of treatment.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.666
Our first step
will be to treat you

12:06.701 --> 12:08.401
To a heroic dose
of antidepressants.

12:08.436 --> 12:12.071
Like what seaworld gives only
their most suicidal orcas.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.540
Okay.

12:13.575 --> 12:14.974
All right, well,
thank you, doctor.

12:15.010 --> 12:16.176
I'll do anything.

12:16.211 --> 12:17.877
Oh, so--
oh, god!

12:21.016 --> 12:23.516
Chanel #3:
Who was operating
in here anyway?

12:23.552 --> 12:25.418
A chad radwell guy

12:25.453 --> 12:27.854
Was butchering cadavers
for some reason.

12:27.889 --> 12:29.489
He said he was
practicing for surgery,

12:29.524 --> 12:31.825
But mainly he was
just chopping off hands

12:31.860 --> 12:33.860
And saying the f-word a lot.

12:35.430 --> 12:37.497
Hey, you, um...

12:37.532 --> 12:40.333
You seemed to be bummed out
by that consult.

12:40.368 --> 12:43.369
There's something
i need to confide in you.

12:43.405 --> 12:45.538
A secret no one knows.

12:46.575 --> 12:48.241
I've never had an orgasm.

12:48.276 --> 12:50.443
Oh, wow.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.246
I didn't even know
what they were until recently.

12:53.281 --> 12:55.114
I thought they were
just moans you did to let

12:55.150 --> 12:56.616
The other person know
to roll off of you,

12:56.651 --> 12:59.719
Like an "i'm ready
for you to stop" alarm.

12:59.754 --> 13:02.121
That's terrible.

13:02.157 --> 13:04.090
Orgasms
are pretty much

13:04.125 --> 13:06.626
The only thing everyone
in the world agrees are great.

13:08.330 --> 13:09.729
Well...

13:09.764 --> 13:11.798
Until<i> hamilton</i> came along.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.467
it's<i> so</i> original, right?

13:14.502 --> 13:16.236
Oh, it reinvented theater.

13:16.271 --> 13:19.606
I mean, a rap musical
about the founding founders?

13:19.641 --> 13:22.108
Changed the world.

13:23.645 --> 13:26.779
And you know what's
really telling about me?

13:26.815 --> 13:28.047
I didn't even like it
that much.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.415
This is all part of

13:29.451 --> 13:31.317
A larger problem
i have in my life.

13:31.353 --> 13:32.952
I am alive, but...

13:32.988 --> 13:35.321
I'm not living.

13:35.357 --> 13:36.923
If it was possible
for me to feel anything,

13:36.958 --> 13:38.424
I would totally
be sobbing right now.

13:38.460 --> 13:41.261
I understand.

13:41.296 --> 13:43.963
Better than you know,
actually.

13:43.999 --> 13:46.099
I have a secret of my own,
as well.

13:46.134 --> 13:48.601
Something i never share
with anyone.

13:48.637 --> 13:52.705
But since you opened up for me,
i want to do the same for you.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.843
I'm dead.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.678
You mean like "in trouble"?

13:58.713 --> 13:59.946
No, like...

13:59.981 --> 14:01.848
Dead, like, actually dead.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.616
I don't understand.

14:05.687 --> 14:08.588
It was my junior year
in high school.

14:08.623 --> 14:09.856
My lacrosse buddies threw

14:09.891 --> 14:11.124
A rad-as-hell kegger

14:11.159 --> 14:12.358
And i got ham-dogged.

14:14.195 --> 14:16.195
<i>My buddies warned me</i>
<i>not to pass out on my back,</i>

14:16.231 --> 14:19.565
<i>Or i would choke on my puke</i>
<i>like jimi hendrix and die.</i>

14:21.136 --> 14:23.369
<i>The next morning</i>
<i>i woke up on my back,</i>

14:23.405 --> 14:24.837
<i>Covered in puke,</i>

14:24.873 --> 14:27.206
<i>And i realized i did die.</i>

14:27.242 --> 14:29.509
And now i'm cursed to walk
the earth for all eternity.

14:29.544 --> 14:31.878
Like a highlander.

14:31.913 --> 14:34.180
Hold up, there was sort of
a big leap in logic there.

14:34.215 --> 14:37.617
Are you sure you didn't just
choke on your puke and die?

14:37.652 --> 14:38.952
Yeah, everything was different.

14:38.987 --> 14:40.320
I started to notice that dogs

14:40.355 --> 14:41.688
Didn't bark at me anymore.

14:41.723 --> 14:44.691
Wait, so if you're dead,

14:44.726 --> 14:47.327
How are you breathing?
I don't know.

14:47.362 --> 14:49.028
That's what i'm trying
to figure out.

14:49.064 --> 14:51.631
That's actually why
i decided to become a doctor.

14:51.666 --> 14:54.033
I needed to know if modern
medicine had an answer.

14:54.069 --> 14:55.735
So far, it's just

14:55.770 --> 14:57.136
Turned up more questions.

14:57.172 --> 14:59.238
I have no clue.
Maybe it's

14:59.274 --> 15:00.707
A<i> night of the living dead</i>
scenario?

15:00.742 --> 15:02.909
Some sort
of zombie sitch or

15:02.944 --> 15:06.713
Maybe there's, like, a task
that i have to accomplish,

15:06.748 --> 15:09.315
Before the universe allows me
to die a natural death

15:09.351 --> 15:11.851
And my immortal soul
is allowed to finally rest.

15:11.886 --> 15:14.988
And after
what you just told me,

15:15.023 --> 15:17.890
I'm starting to think
maybe that task

15:17.926 --> 15:20.393
Is to help you
feel alive again.

15:20.428 --> 15:23.730
That's very noble and romantic,
but i've seen so much

15:23.765 --> 15:26.232
Death and tragedy
and had so much loss in my life,

15:26.267 --> 15:27.867
That it's like
i'm encased in steel.

15:27.902 --> 15:30.770
Chanel #3, i'm a doctor.

15:30.805 --> 15:33.072
Bringing people
back to life is what i do.

15:33.108 --> 15:35.274
I may be dead...

15:35.310 --> 15:37.043
But you are not.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.545
Please give me the chance

15:39.581 --> 15:41.814
To help you see that.

15:49.257 --> 15:50.723
Wow.

15:50.759 --> 15:52.859
Your lips are super cold.

15:52.894 --> 15:55.561
I told you.

15:55.597 --> 15:57.663
I'm dead.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.927
chanel #5:
C, a,

16:03.963 --> 16:07.264
B, i,

16:07.299 --> 16:09.633
T, y--
"cabity."

16:09.668 --> 16:11.802
Triple word score.

16:11.837 --> 16:13.370
"cabity" is
not a word.

16:13.405 --> 16:15.038
Yes, it is.

16:15.074 --> 16:17.608
It's what happens when you
forget to brush your teeth.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.842
All right, fine.

16:18.877 --> 16:20.677
Still beating you by 350 points.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.447
Why are you guys playing
scrabble right now?

16:23.482 --> 16:25.148
I got it off
of chamberlain's cart.

16:25.184 --> 16:26.717
Scrabble helps me think
and it's good for the brain.

16:26.752 --> 16:28.385
We have a mystery to solve.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.120
I just don't understand
why she said

16:30.155 --> 16:31.622
I need to use esrun cream.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.056
I mean, my skin is amazing.

16:33.092 --> 16:35.158
I moisturize
three times a day

16:35.194 --> 16:37.461
With this really shady stuff
i have to order from china,

16:37.496 --> 16:38.862
Which i've heard
is either

16:38.897 --> 16:40.130
A) panda sperm,

16:40.165 --> 16:42.232
Or b) stem cells
of political prisoners.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.902
I mean, i don't know.
I don't ask questions,

16:45.938 --> 16:47.638
Because i'm really pleased
with the results!

16:54.446 --> 16:56.046
That's it!

17:09.361 --> 17:11.128
Oh, hi there.

17:12.197 --> 17:13.563
What are you doing here?

17:13.599 --> 17:15.699
Just airing out my scroat, brah.

17:15.734 --> 17:16.767
What?

17:16.802 --> 17:18.268
Don't worry about it.

17:18.304 --> 17:21.238
I said i'm airing out my scroat.

17:21.273 --> 17:23.607
And i brought you
your list of handidates.

17:23.642 --> 17:26.343
My what?
Your prospective list
of hand donors.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.011
They're all in need
of fast cash.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.081
And i'm pretty sure
none of them are serial killers.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.851
Janusz brozowsky, 41, janitor.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.586
He's ambidextrous.

17:36.622 --> 17:39.556
Said he can still rock a mop
with just a left hand and a nub.

17:39.591 --> 17:40.857
Fred barnsdall,

17:40.893 --> 17:43.293
A 66-year-old accordion player.
Great guy.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.796
There's danny rodriguez,
assistant manager at subway.

17:45.831 --> 17:47.531
He said the job's
so boring he's just

17:47.566 --> 17:49.966
Thinking about cutting
his hand off anyway.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.401
Get out.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.538
Also, i'm gonna be
performing the surgery.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.740
No.

17:56.775 --> 17:59.209
There's no way you're
performing the surgery.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.644
There's yes way
i'm performing the surgery,

18:00.679 --> 18:03.413
Because a) dean munsch loves me,

18:03.449 --> 18:05.315
B) this is a teaching hospital,

18:05.351 --> 18:07.884
C) i've been practicing
on a lot of cadavers,

18:07.920 --> 18:09.619
And d) did you notice that

18:09.655 --> 18:11.455
Our wangers
are about the same size?

18:16.595 --> 18:19.329
now, remind me
again why we're here.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.264
"esrun" backwards
is "nurse."

18:21.300 --> 18:23.166
When i googled it,
this came up.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.302
An article in<i> central</i>
<i>florida realtor monthly</i>

18:25.337 --> 18:27.137
From about five years ago.
You know, we could've gone

18:27.172 --> 18:29.172
Over all of this if you had
just flown with us on the plane.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.241
Yes, well, i don't fly
commercial, just private.

18:31.276 --> 18:34.177
All right, "the house
that esrun built.

18:34.213 --> 18:36.580
"how nurse
lynn johnstone turned

18:36.615 --> 18:38.415
"homemade hand cream
into the crown jewel

18:38.450 --> 18:39.816
Of florida real estate,"
hmm.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.251
So, there's a big

18:41.286 --> 18:43.086
Mansion in the middle
of the everglades.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.755
I still don't get what this has
to do with the green meanie.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.590
None of us do, you idiot.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.658
But, obviously, hester
wants us to find out.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.660
This is some
good sleuthing,

18:50.696 --> 18:51.661
Zayday williams.

18:51.697 --> 18:52.929
too good.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.131
Could you just stop?

18:54.166 --> 18:55.699
It's obvious i'm not the killer.

18:59.738 --> 19:00.971
Hello.

19:01.006 --> 19:02.339
We're looking
for a lynn johnstone.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.274
Is she here?

19:04.309 --> 19:07.177
Excuse me, i'm lynn johnstone.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.779
Mm?
You know,

19:08.814 --> 19:10.447
Eight percent of nurses are male

19:10.482 --> 19:12.182
And lynn is a noble celtic name.

19:12.217 --> 19:14.117
It means "pool or "lake."

19:14.153 --> 19:15.318
All right, pretty in pink.

19:15.354 --> 19:16.787
Don't get your panties
in a bunch.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.522
You mind if we come inside?

19:18.557 --> 19:20.490
It's as hot
as fish grease out here.

19:20.526 --> 19:21.992
And special agent hemphill

19:22.027 --> 19:23.860
Is getting a little damp
in the crack.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.065
Welcome to the house of esrun.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.233
Watch your step.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.836
There's moisturizer everywhere.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.806
This is my in-home studio
where i film all

19:35.841 --> 19:37.908
The esrun cream infomercials.

19:37.943 --> 19:40.710
We are in 150
different countries

19:40.746 --> 19:44.014
And last year we grossed
over $350 million.

19:44.049 --> 19:46.716
Yes, well, that's
all very interesting,

19:46.752 --> 19:50.086
But we're here about our lady
of perpetual suffering hospital.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.688
Your name

19:51.723 --> 19:53.390
Came up as a possible link

19:53.425 --> 19:56.193
To some recent incidents
that transpired.

19:56.228 --> 19:57.994
I used to work there.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.930
I was there the night
it happened.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.665
The night<i> what</i> happened?

20:01.700 --> 20:04.935
An entire floor of patients
and staff were euthanized.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.404
Say what now?!
I was in the bathroom.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.372
Because i had to make
a big ol' number two.

20:09.408 --> 20:13.243
(echo and the bunnymen's
"the killing moon" playing)

20:13.278 --> 20:15.612
<i>I was in that bathroom</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

20:15.647 --> 20:17.914
<i>See, i had just started</i>
<i>taking psyllium husks.</i>

20:17.950 --> 20:20.016
And those things
scrub you like a brush.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.419
So i was doing some
Vocalizations

20:22.454 --> 20:24.754
To sort of work
through the discomfort.

20:28.427 --> 20:30.594
And that explains
why i didn't hear anything.

20:45.844 --> 20:47.477
<i>I talked to one reporter,</i>

20:47.513 --> 20:49.579
<i>But the hospital board</i>
<i>paid me $5 million</i>

20:49.615 --> 20:53.817
<i>In hush money and made me sign</i>
<i>a nondisclosure agreement.</i>

20:53.852 --> 20:56.086
I put all of that money
into esrun cream!

20:56.121 --> 20:58.288
Which is actually just jergens.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.923
I put it in different
bottles and put

20:59.958 --> 21:02.559
A sticker on it that says,
"approved by nurses"

21:02.594 --> 21:04.261
And charge three,
four times the price.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.630
So, wait, you never got
a glimpse of the murderer?

21:06.665 --> 21:07.931
I didn't have to.

21:07.966 --> 21:09.266
I know who did it.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.335
In october of 1986,

21:12.371 --> 21:14.271
<i>I'd only been at the hospital</i>
<i>for a few months,</i>

21:14.306 --> 21:16.273
<i>But i became best friends</i>
<i>with nurse thomas,</i>

21:16.308 --> 21:18.008
<i>Who'd been there for years.</i>

21:18.043 --> 21:20.677
And one night before she
and everyone else were killed,

21:20.712 --> 21:23.179
She was freaking out because
halloween was coming up,

21:23.215 --> 21:25.148
And it reminded her
of the year before.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.751
<i>When a pregnant lady and</i>
<i>her husband came into the er,</i>

21:27.786 --> 21:29.986
<i>And the doctors</i>
<i>let her husband die</i>

21:30.022 --> 21:32.088
<i>And threw his body</i>
<i>in the swamp.</i>

21:32.124 --> 21:33.657
And a few weeks later,
nurse thomas,

21:33.692 --> 21:35.191
Along with everyone else,
was dead.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.027
I knew there had to be

21:37.062 --> 21:39.930
A connection between that
halloween and the year before.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.865
But i tried my best
to just forget about it.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.867
But then a few weeks ago...

21:43.902 --> 21:46.102
The phone calls started.

21:47.673 --> 21:50.607
Esrun, approved by nurses,
lynn speaking.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.309
I will come from the swamp,

21:52.344 --> 21:54.210
Where you threw
all of the bodies.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.211
What?

21:55.247 --> 21:56.446
Who is this?

21:56.481 --> 21:58.782
You have blood on your hands.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.784
I am a proud male nurse.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.285
This is harassment!

22:02.321 --> 22:06.556
I'm going to kill again.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.792
They were trying to hide it,

22:08.827 --> 22:11.061
But i knew that
it was a woman's voice.

22:11.096 --> 22:13.063
My first thought was,
"oh, my god,

22:13.098 --> 22:14.230
It's that pregnant woman."

22:14.266 --> 22:17.233
Or the baby
of the pregnant woman.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.002
That occurred to me, too.

22:19.037 --> 22:20.503
Chanel #5:
Or maybe the swamp

22:20.539 --> 22:22.038
Is filled with
feminizing chemical agents

22:22.074 --> 22:23.473
And they thought that it was
the guy that they drowned,

22:23.508 --> 22:25.175
But he came back
as an androgynous swamp monster

22:25.210 --> 22:26.710
Bent on revenge.

22:26.745 --> 22:28.345
Yeah, i think
that's less likely.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.713
Thank you very much, nurse.

22:29.748 --> 22:31.281
We'll be in touch. Ladies!

22:32.451 --> 22:34.351
We need these for evidence.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.927
<i> Well, i don't know why</i>
<i>you girls are so exhausted.</i>

22:42.961 --> 22:44.361
My flight was divine.

22:44.397 --> 22:46.630
We had to
fly southwest.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.765
We had a three-hour
layover in islip.

22:48.801 --> 22:49.766
Yes.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.636
But the trip proved helpful,

22:51.670 --> 22:53.271
Because we now have
a definitive link

22:53.305 --> 22:55.706
Between the murders in 1986

22:55.742 --> 22:57.374
And what's been happening
at the hospital.

22:57.409 --> 22:59.810
Hold on. This still
don't make sense to me.

22:59.845 --> 23:03.147
If the killer wanted to avenge
the death of the patient

23:03.181 --> 23:05.315
That those nurses and doctors
threw into the swamp,

23:05.351 --> 23:08.986
Why he start killing now? Hmm?

23:09.022 --> 23:10.720
He already got his revenge.

23:10.756 --> 23:13.056
Those nurses and doctors
already dead.

23:13.091 --> 23:14.124
That's right.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.993
That wolfgirl, randal, tyler,

23:16.028 --> 23:17.160
They were all patients.

23:17.196 --> 23:18.629
Why would the killer want to
go after them?

23:18.665 --> 23:19.964
Well, it makes perfect

23:19.998 --> 23:21.165
Sense to me.

23:21.199 --> 23:23.734
The killer wants revenge
on my hospital.

23:23.770 --> 23:24.802
And the best way to do that

23:24.836 --> 23:26.504
Is start killing patients.

23:26.538 --> 23:27.537
Now, we already know

23:27.573 --> 23:29.139
Who the killer is.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.575
It's someone at this hospital.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.244
Someone who's
over six feet tall,

23:33.278 --> 23:34.879
Which means he's probably male,

23:34.913 --> 23:36.380
Which rules out that mother.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.149
But the baby she was
pregnant with,

23:38.184 --> 23:40.584
That little boy,
was born in 1986.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.820
That makes him...

23:42.854 --> 23:44.054
Around 30.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.323
So, it could be cassidy.

23:46.359 --> 23:47.891
Or chad radwell.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.392
Chad's our age!

23:49.428 --> 23:50.828
Nuh-uh.

23:50.862 --> 23:53.163
Chad told me when he was
in the second grade,

23:53.198 --> 23:56.266
He got held back
for eight consecutive years.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.201
His ass is 30.

23:58.236 --> 24:00.271
Or... It could be chamberlain.

24:00.305 --> 24:02.172
Chamberlain?

24:02.207 --> 24:03.573
I mean, i guess it could be.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.176
I just never would have
suspected.

24:05.210 --> 24:07.143
I have to go!

24:09.247 --> 24:11.014
Hmm. Janusz.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.350
I need you to put your hand
on the cutting board

24:12.384 --> 24:13.717
So i can saw your hand off.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.723
It's a good looking hand.

24:18.757 --> 24:21.524
It's gonna sting a little bit.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.695
This is not how you
perform a surgery.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.063
You might want to se--

24:27.100 --> 24:29.899
You might want to
sedate the patient first.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.936
Look, i know this is
a teaching hospital,

24:31.970 --> 24:33.970
And i have no problem
with dean munsch

24:34.006 --> 24:35.406
Letting you saw
the handidate's hand off.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.307
In fact, i'm such
a good surgeon,

24:37.342 --> 24:38.476
No matter how bad you
botch this up,

24:38.511 --> 24:39.944
I'll be able to fix it
with one hand.

24:39.978 --> 24:40.977
Okay.

24:41.014 --> 24:42.312
You want to know what
no one likes?

24:42.348 --> 24:44.782
A back seat hand surgeon.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.484
And because you interrupted
my doctor flow,

24:46.518 --> 24:48.418
I'm not gonna sedate
either one of you.

24:53.760 --> 24:54.925
Stop the procedure!

24:54.961 --> 24:56.559
We don't have to do the
transplant.

24:56.595 --> 24:57.994
I know you're not the killer.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.764
Somebody's killing a bunch of
folks in this hospital,

24:59.798 --> 25:01.231
He's got the hand
of a serial killer.

25:01.267 --> 25:02.399
No, no. No.

25:02.434 --> 25:03.968
The killer is
around age 30.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.802
Dr. Holt is
much older.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.405
But you're not.

25:08.441 --> 25:10.640
You are now my
prime suspect.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.510
Thank you,
dean munsch.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.579
Now, i can get back

25:15.615 --> 25:17.081
Saving lives.

25:17.115 --> 25:20.483
And winning the hearts of nubile
young medical students.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.157
Oh, you think this is
the end of the movie.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.624
It's not.

25:27.660 --> 25:28.858
This is the
first part.

25:28.894 --> 25:30.360
Where the bad guy
beats the good guy

25:30.396 --> 25:32.095
And then the good guy
trains in a montage,

25:32.131 --> 25:34.264
Comes back,
beats the bad guy,

25:34.300 --> 25:35.932
Freeze-frame
into a kiss with the girl,

25:35.968 --> 25:38.401
As my old and ethnic mentor
looks on!

25:40.338 --> 25:41.771
Listen, howdy doody,

25:41.807 --> 25:43.173
You're younger
than i am,

25:43.209 --> 25:44.374
You're richer than i am,
but let me

25:44.410 --> 25:45.809
Guarantee you one thing.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.977
The next body i touch
with these hands,

25:48.014 --> 25:50.381
Which i'm keeping,
will be chanel's.

25:50.416 --> 25:51.981
And i'm gonna get in my car

25:52.017 --> 25:53.818
And i'm gonna drive
to tiffany's.

25:53.852 --> 25:55.385
I'm gonna hand
the clerk my wallet

25:55.421 --> 25:56.619
And buy an engagement ring.

25:56.655 --> 25:58.956
I'm gonna slip it
on her finger

25:58.990 --> 26:00.724
And marry her.

26:05.597 --> 26:07.164
I'm chad radwell.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.499
And i always win.

26:08.534 --> 26:10.334
No matter what.

26:10.369 --> 26:12.970
I don't think you know
who i am.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.005
Or what i'm capable of, chad.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.441
The things i've done,
the things i'm willing to do.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.711
If you're smart,

26:20.747 --> 26:21.711
You will get in your car

26:21.747 --> 26:23.881
And you will not come back.

26:29.454 --> 26:31.021
<i>I don't understand.</i>

26:31.057 --> 26:33.490
There's no history of
this kind of psychosis

26:33.526 --> 26:34.892
In her life or family.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.227
No, no!

26:36.262 --> 26:37.994
I got all
type of-- oh!

26:38.030 --> 26:39.396
Wait, i know
what this is.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.664
This is what
chanel #5 is like

26:40.700 --> 26:41.698
When she takes
an overdose

26:41.733 --> 26:43.200
On her anti-depressants.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.001
One time, she got
in a huge fight

26:45.037 --> 26:46.570
With our couch,
and we took her to the doctor,

26:46.606 --> 26:48.171
And he said it was
something called

26:48.206 --> 26:50.840
Emotional lability.

26:50.876 --> 26:51.841
Maybe because
mrs. Baumgartner

26:51.878 --> 26:53.177
Doesn't need the
anti-depressants,

26:53.211 --> 26:54.211
They're screwing with
her brain chemistry

26:54.247 --> 26:55.412
And making her
act all nutty.

26:55.448 --> 26:56.579
Oh, god!

26:56.615 --> 26:57.615
Help me, please!

26:57.649 --> 27:00.416
No!

27:01.454 --> 27:03.119
Why do i have to
do the poses?

27:03.155 --> 27:05.555
Can't you do them and let me
play the doctor part?

27:05.590 --> 27:07.291
Well, i'm not
playing doctor.

27:07.325 --> 27:08.892
I... Am a doctor.

27:08.927 --> 27:12.095
Which means i'm the one who has
a rigorously tested knowledge

27:12.131 --> 27:13.396
Of anatomy. So,

27:13.432 --> 27:14.865
I have to be the one
to examine you,

27:14.901 --> 27:16.700
While you get
into the same position

27:16.735 --> 27:18.535
Sheila was in
when her condition started.

27:18.570 --> 27:19.903
Can i just say,
for the record,

27:19.939 --> 27:21.070
Before we begin,
that yoga is

27:21.106 --> 27:22.472
Just stretching
for douchebags.

27:22.508 --> 27:23.673
Noted.

27:24.577 --> 27:27.077
Okay, so sheila said

27:27.113 --> 27:29.280
When she first started
being symptomatic,

27:29.314 --> 27:32.081
She was in a pose called
"sirsa padasana."

27:32.117 --> 27:33.249
I can't do that.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.218
It's okay.
Don't worry.

27:35.253 --> 27:36.653
I'll help you.

27:39.425 --> 27:40.957
Okay, perfect.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.559
Great, now are
you feeling

27:42.595 --> 27:44.595
Pressure anywhere
in particular?

27:44.630 --> 27:46.630
There's an overall feeling

27:46.666 --> 27:48.499
Like i'm gonna snap in half,
but if i really focus,

27:48.534 --> 27:50.334
I can feel some strain
in my lower back,

27:50.369 --> 27:52.436
Kind of running through
my pelvis.

27:52.470 --> 27:54.271
And my butt entrance
feels tingly, but...

27:54.307 --> 27:55.539
That's not unusual.

27:56.541 --> 27:57.874
Um...

28:02.814 --> 28:03.780
Chanel #3,

28:03.816 --> 28:05.416
I'm gonna twist your hips

28:05.450 --> 28:06.816
Just slightly, okay?

28:12.959 --> 28:14.124
What was that?

28:14.160 --> 28:15.325
It felt like you
touched my hooha.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.461
Wh-what happened is, um,

28:17.495 --> 28:20.130
Your sacrospinous ligament runs

28:20.166 --> 28:21.798
From the outer edge
of your sacrum,

28:21.834 --> 28:23.466
To the spine of
your ischium.

28:23.501 --> 28:26.102
And your pudendal nerves run
right beneath that.

28:26.137 --> 28:27.805
So, if there's any
irritation to it,

28:27.840 --> 28:29.840
It would cause
inflammation,

28:29.876 --> 28:32.476
Which would press against
the pudendal nerve,

28:32.510 --> 28:34.811
And cause it to
fire uncontrollably.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.146
So, sheila baumgartner
hurt her thing

28:37.182 --> 28:38.682
While doing yoga
and that irritated

28:38.718 --> 28:40.149
Her other thing, and...

28:40.186 --> 28:41.385
That thing is
what's making her

28:41.419 --> 28:42.653
Pop off all the time?

28:42.688 --> 28:45.555
Yeah. Exactly.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.992
So all i need to do is...

28:49.028 --> 28:50.561
Block off her
pudendal nerve

28:50.595 --> 28:52.829
With a simple surgery

28:52.865 --> 28:54.097
And she's cured.

29:01.606 --> 29:03.039
Chad!

29:03.075 --> 29:04.575
Chanel!
Chad!

29:04.610 --> 29:06.309
What is going on?

29:06.345 --> 29:07.510
What do you mean?

29:07.546 --> 29:08.512
Why does something have to be
going on?

29:08.546 --> 29:09.546
Can't i just ask you to,

29:09.581 --> 29:10.847
You know, meet me
in the park

29:10.883 --> 29:12.383
And walk and talk
some things over?

29:12.418 --> 29:14.418
No, chad. You can't,
because it's super weird

29:14.452 --> 29:16.086
And it seems like
you want to murder me.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.421
I mean, i actually brought

29:17.456 --> 29:18.756
A stun gun!
Wha--

29:18.791 --> 29:20.157
When was the last time
you wanted to,

29:20.191 --> 29:21.858
A) go for
a walk with me,

29:21.894 --> 29:24.461
Or b) have an
actual conversation?

29:25.530 --> 29:26.829
Let's walk and talk.

29:29.535 --> 29:32.035
Look, i've been doing
some soul searching.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.570
I don't know why.

29:33.606 --> 29:35.738
Maybe because another one
of my friends is missing

29:35.774 --> 29:37.206
And presumably murdered.

29:37.242 --> 29:38.776
or because

29:38.811 --> 29:40.711
There's a hot surgeon
with a murdering hand

29:40.745 --> 29:42.445
Obviously trying to
get in that box!

29:43.749 --> 29:45.749
Anyway...

29:45.785 --> 29:48.552
I've been thinking.

29:48.586 --> 29:50.688
About you.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.789
and me.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.291
Us.

29:54.327 --> 29:56.894
Okay.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.735
chanel,

30:05.771 --> 30:07.370
I'm in love with you.

30:07.405 --> 30:09.606
What?

30:09.642 --> 30:12.575
wha...

30:12.610 --> 30:14.378
Even when i told all those
other chicks i was banging

30:14.412 --> 30:16.312
How awesome it was that
they didn't have wangs,

30:16.349 --> 30:17.581
And i was in love
with them,

30:17.615 --> 30:20.416
Really, i was
in love with you.

30:20.452 --> 30:21.785
Really?

30:21.820 --> 30:25.155
Love, it's a funny thing.
Isn't it?

30:26.492 --> 30:27.992
Chanel oberlin,

30:28.026 --> 30:29.827
Will you...

30:29.861 --> 30:31.227
Pedro?

30:31.262 --> 30:33.430
Oh, my god, is this
really happening?

30:33.465 --> 30:35.499
Get your lawyers to look over
this prenup.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.101
Are you asking me
to marry you?!

30:37.135 --> 30:38.334
Oh, not really.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.570
I'll consider asking you
to marry me,

30:39.604 --> 30:40.938
Um, if you sign
the prenup.

30:40.972 --> 30:42.573
Uh, you're gonna want
a whole legal team to,

30:42.608 --> 30:44.307
Kind of, look over this.
There's a lot of stipulations

30:44.343 --> 30:45.976
And some pretty
specific riders.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.144
Chad!

30:47.178 --> 30:49.079
I feel like
i'm in a fairy tale!

30:49.115 --> 30:52.115
Yes! Yes!
A thousand times yes!

31:30.430 --> 31:32.930
Once the epidural kicked in,
the orgasms stopped.

31:32.966 --> 31:35.933
Can't you just numb me
from the waist down forever?

31:35.969 --> 31:37.401
That won't be necessary.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.904
I just relieved compression
on your pudendal nerve,

31:39.939 --> 31:41.973
So you should return
to normal functioning.

31:42.008 --> 31:44.442
what will you do with
your newfound freedom?

31:44.477 --> 31:45.643
I am gonna go to the movies,
and i'm

31:45.678 --> 31:47.411
Not gonna worry about
getting kicked out

31:47.447 --> 31:48.780
Because i'm too loud.

31:48.815 --> 31:50.081
And then,

31:50.116 --> 31:51.482
I'm gonna teach a yoga class

31:51.518 --> 31:53.484
Till the very end.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.919
I am gonna enjoy

31:54.954 --> 31:57.522
All of life's pleasures
that have been denied me...

31:57.557 --> 31:58.890
Since all this began.

31:59.959 --> 32:01.926
And we...

32:01.961 --> 32:03.227
Are finished.

32:04.998 --> 32:07.465
Time to start enjoying life
again.

32:32.192 --> 32:33.291
You okay?

32:33.326 --> 32:35.526
I think it's the music, baby.

32:35.562 --> 32:37.128
I get distracted by r&b.

32:37.163 --> 32:39.197
You see, it stands for
rhythm and blues,

32:39.232 --> 32:41.065
But it's the least bluesy style
of music

32:41.100 --> 32:43.467
And its rhythm is hardly what's
most remarkable about it.

32:43.503 --> 32:47.038
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay.

32:47.073 --> 32:48.573
(upbeat old school
hip-hop plays)

32:53.346 --> 32:55.680
I can't do new jack swing.

32:55.715 --> 32:58.516
See, it reminds me of this film,
<i>new jack city,</i>

32:58.551 --> 33:00.518
And then my mind immediately
goes to wesley snipes

33:00.553 --> 33:03.187
And all his trouble
with the irs.

33:03.223 --> 33:05.523
it's just so sad.

33:05.558 --> 33:06.891
Very sad.

33:06.926 --> 33:07.925
Okay.

33:10.396 --> 33:12.563
Chanel #3,

33:12.599 --> 33:14.899
I'm in love with you.

33:14.934 --> 33:16.400
You'll always be safe with me.

33:16.436 --> 33:18.002
Now, it's time for you

33:18.037 --> 33:20.371
To feel the power...

33:20.406 --> 33:22.540
And the glory...

33:22.575 --> 33:24.041
Of the female orgasm.

33:26.079 --> 33:27.778
I'm sorry.

33:27.814 --> 33:29.780
I don't know what's wrong.

33:29.816 --> 33:32.450
Maybe you're just...

33:32.485 --> 33:33.885
Not into me.

33:33.920 --> 33:37.722
No... I'm very
attracted to you.

33:37.757 --> 33:39.023
It's just that
every time we touch,

33:39.058 --> 33:41.792
You're, like,
freezing.

33:41.828 --> 33:43.728
It feels like i'm
hugging a snowman.

33:43.763 --> 33:46.197
Right, but, we dis...

33:46.232 --> 33:48.199
We discussed this.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.901
I'm dead. I...

33:49.936 --> 33:51.702
Hot blood doesn't run
through my veins

33:51.738 --> 33:53.738
Like it does yours.

33:53.773 --> 33:55.740
You want proof?

34:10.156 --> 34:11.622
61 degrees.

34:11.658 --> 34:14.458
Oh, my god.
You<i> are</i> dead.

34:19.098 --> 34:21.499
Where is he?
Who?

34:21.534 --> 34:22.633
The patient!
You had me paged.

34:22.669 --> 34:24.168
They said it was
an emergency.

34:24.203 --> 34:26.804
There is.
I need to talk to you.

34:26.839 --> 34:28.940
Also, uh, i need help tying
this old-fashioned bow tie

34:28.975 --> 34:30.174
For my wedding tomorrow.

34:30.209 --> 34:31.642
I mean, i figured
a guy like you,

34:31.678 --> 34:32.843
Who was around
during the civil war

34:32.879 --> 34:34.445
Would probably know how
to do it.

34:34.480 --> 34:37.181
Okay, i have a dilemma.
All my best buds are dead.

34:37.216 --> 34:38.849
Okay? My frat bros,
then randall

34:38.885 --> 34:41.118
I got no one to be
my best man.

34:41.154 --> 34:42.586
You don't have brothers?

34:42.622 --> 34:45.256
Yeah, but i figure
they're probably busy and

34:45.291 --> 34:46.757
Also kind of want to save 'em
to be my best man

34:46.793 --> 34:48.292
For the second wedding.

34:48.328 --> 34:50.461
You know, that's the one
that usually sticks, you know?

34:50.496 --> 34:53.264
Anyway, i was kind of hoping
you'd do it.

34:53.299 --> 34:55.666
I hate you.

34:55.702 --> 34:57.702
But you love chanel!

34:57.737 --> 34:59.203
Look, the best man's
most important job is

34:59.238 --> 35:00.805
To make sure the groom
doesn't freak out

35:00.840 --> 35:01.973
And leave his bride
at the altar.

35:02.008 --> 35:03.107
You get what i'm saying here?

35:03.142 --> 35:05.476
Mm-hmm.

35:05.511 --> 35:08.312
You have cold feet.

35:08.348 --> 35:10.214
look, you're
gonna get this

35:10.249 --> 35:12.683
Because, obviously, we're
both really handsome.

35:12.719 --> 35:14.485
Girls really want
to bone me, okay?

35:14.520 --> 35:16.020
When i die,
i've left instructions

35:16.055 --> 35:17.521
To grind me up
into a fine powder

35:17.557 --> 35:18.789
To be given out
to underprivileged dudes

35:18.825 --> 35:20.291
Who have trouble
getting laid.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.560
Because i'm convinced if they
rub my essence on 'em,

35:22.595 --> 35:24.462
They're pretty much
guaranteed to get ass.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.863
Look, i'm not cut out
for monogamy, okay?

35:25.898 --> 35:27.398
This is not what i do.

35:27.433 --> 35:29.734
I mean, in a couple days,
once i bone a girl

35:29.769 --> 35:31.669
At a stop light,
or at an ihop,

35:31.704 --> 35:34.205
Or public park, i'll be
cheating on my wife.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.506
I don't know if
i want to be that guy.

35:35.541 --> 35:36.707
Then don't get married.

35:36.743 --> 35:39.076
What? It's a little late
for that.

35:39.112 --> 35:41.812
Getting left at the altar
works in julia roberts movies

35:41.848 --> 35:43.581
Or on<i> grey's anatomy,</i>

35:43.616 --> 35:45.383
But in real life,
that ruins you.

35:45.418 --> 35:49.153
I don't want
to hurt chanel.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.755
Isn't that weird?
I just want her to be happy.

35:50.790 --> 35:52.690
I want her to have
a great wedding day.

35:52.725 --> 35:54.525
I don't want my worries
about my future studliness

35:54.560 --> 35:57.061
To get in the way
of her special day.

35:57.096 --> 35:58.662
Whatever happens
down the road,

35:58.698 --> 36:00.498
I want this day
to be for her.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.900
Maybe i almost love her,
you know?

36:15.948 --> 36:17.782
You're tying the bow tie
a little tight, bro.

36:17.817 --> 36:19.617
It needs to be tight.

36:19.652 --> 36:20.618
Hold on.

36:29.896 --> 36:32.029
Okay...

36:32.065 --> 36:33.264
I'll be your best man.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.033
Hookers to celebrate?

36:36.069 --> 36:37.902
Let's not.

36:39.772 --> 36:41.205
Oh, and you should know,

36:41.240 --> 36:44.442
When you guys
break up in six months,

36:44.477 --> 36:46.243
I'm gonna be there
to comfort chanel

36:46.279 --> 36:48.412
By having a lot
of sex with her.

36:48.448 --> 36:50.281
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

36:59.492 --> 37:01.759
It's a 29-carat
internally flawless

37:01.794 --> 37:04.161
Fancy-vivid diamond
in the extremely rare

37:04.197 --> 37:05.596
"whore cut."

37:05.631 --> 37:07.398
Which is the preferred cut
for mistresses

37:07.433 --> 37:08.432
Of russian billionaires.

37:08.468 --> 37:11.569
Wow! That is
one huge diamond.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.104
I know, right?
It's so heavy,

37:13.139 --> 37:15.005
It comes with its own
chiropractor on call,

37:15.041 --> 37:18.175
Has a built-in lojack system,
and is its own wi-fi hot spot.

37:18.211 --> 37:21.445
Ladies, there's something
important i need to ask you.

37:21.481 --> 37:24.281
It may be the most
emotional decision

37:24.317 --> 37:25.616
A bride-to-be
has to make.

37:25.651 --> 37:27.151
Chanel #3,

37:27.186 --> 37:29.954
Would you be one
of my bridesmaids?

37:29.989 --> 37:31.455
Of course i would,
chanel.

37:31.491 --> 37:33.324
Zayday, would you
also consider

37:33.359 --> 37:35.159
Being one of my
bridesmaids?

37:35.194 --> 37:37.094
Chanel, i'm so touched.

37:37.130 --> 37:38.162
I would love nothing more.

37:39.665 --> 37:42.600
Chanel #5, would you
do me the honor,

37:42.635 --> 37:45.336
Of being my ring bearer?

37:45.371 --> 37:47.771
Wait.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.174
Don't i get to be
a bridesmaid, too?
What?

37:50.209 --> 37:53.477
No! News flash, number five,
we're not that close!

37:53.513 --> 37:55.346
It's ring bearer
or nothing!

37:55.381 --> 37:57.381
And just fyi,

37:57.416 --> 37:58.782
You're gonna have to
dress up like a dog

37:58.818 --> 38:00.317
And walk down the aisle
on all fours

38:00.353 --> 38:01.952
With the ring sitting
on a cute little pillow

38:01.988 --> 38:03.821
That is strapped to your back
like a tiny saddle.

38:03.856 --> 38:05.389
Because having a dog
be the ring bearer

38:05.424 --> 38:08.526
Is so hot in wedding trends
right now. Oh, and also,

38:08.561 --> 38:10.161
The wedding is tomorrow.
What?
What?

38:10.196 --> 38:11.862
Don't you need to,
like,<i> plan</i> a wedding?

38:11.898 --> 38:15.633
Uh, yeah, i did, this afternoon.
Chad's super rich.

38:15.668 --> 38:17.134
I just did a rush order
on everything.

38:17.170 --> 38:18.903
Plus i need to strike
while the iron is hot.

38:18.938 --> 38:21.805
If i wait too long,
chad might change his mind.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.908
Or forget.

38:23.943 --> 38:26.177
I'm getting married!

38:29.549 --> 38:33.017
And this is your official
c.U.R.E. Discharge balloon.

38:33.052 --> 38:35.052
This balloon means you've
officially been cured.

38:35.087 --> 38:37.388
Oh, that is so sweet!

38:37.423 --> 38:39.523
Now, does everybody who
gets cured here get one?

38:39.559 --> 38:40.925
They will. You're
the first patient

38:40.960 --> 38:43.360
That's been able to
get cured and survive.

38:43.396 --> 38:44.862
Excuse me?
Nothing.

38:44.897 --> 38:47.264
Well, i guarantee you this.

38:47.300 --> 38:50.034
I won't be the last,
because i've already called

38:50.069 --> 38:52.369
The local news,
and told them the story

38:52.405 --> 38:54.705
Of my amazing care
i received here.

38:54.740 --> 38:56.941
I plan on putting
both of you guys,

38:56.976 --> 38:58.409
This whole hospital,
on the map.

38:58.444 --> 38:59.877
Hello!

39:32.912 --> 39:35.579
Aah!
All right, green meanie--

39:35.615 --> 39:37.314
Whoever you are--

39:37.350 --> 39:38.782
Let's go, bitch.

39:44.857 --> 39:47.291
Zayday!

39:47.326 --> 39:49.293
Oh, chamberlain,
you're gonna need

39:49.328 --> 39:50.894
A hell of a lot
of stitches.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.997
It's gonna be okay.

39:53.032 --> 39:54.765
I don't understand.
Why didn't he or she

39:54.800 --> 39:55.799
Come after you?

40:09.991 --> 40:11.724
Denise, zayday.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.426
To what do i owe
the pleasure?

40:13.461 --> 40:14.961
We're here to welcome you
to the basement

40:14.996 --> 40:16.462
Of the c.U.R.E.
Institute.

40:16.498 --> 40:19.699
You know, i have to say
i am just<i> delighted.</i>

40:19.734 --> 40:22.468
But i have to ask,
why the change of heart?

40:22.504 --> 40:26.806
Well, your esrun lead
turned out to be legit.

40:26.841 --> 40:30.977
So i pulled a few
strings at quantico

40:31.012 --> 40:33.046
And had you
transferred here,

40:33.081 --> 40:34.580
On the condition that
you cooperate

40:34.616 --> 40:35.948
With our investigation.

40:35.984 --> 40:38.318
Another patient in this
hospital was murdered.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.753
The green meanie chopped
the orgasm lady's head off

40:40.789 --> 40:42.088
Right before my very eyes.

40:42.123 --> 40:43.956
Mm-hmm.
And tried to kill

40:43.992 --> 40:45.591
That little chunky
black orderly.

40:45.627 --> 40:47.894
But he refused
to kill me.

40:47.929 --> 40:49.595
And i'd like
to find out why.

40:49.631 --> 40:52.465
Probably 'cause y'all
working together.

40:52.500 --> 40:53.666
Would you stop it!

40:56.671 --> 40:57.970
What's so funny?

40:59.341 --> 41:02.108
Stop laughing like that!
It's creepy!

41:04.346 --> 41:05.645
Damn it,
you homely bitch,

41:05.680 --> 41:07.146
You tell us who
the green meanie is

41:07.182 --> 41:08.781
Before he kills again.

41:10.218 --> 41:11.951
It's too late.

42:26.861 --> 42:29.529
Isn't the groom supposed
to walk down the aisle first?

42:29.564 --> 42:32.098
Chad asked me to come first.

42:32.133 --> 42:34.434
He said i should
get used to it.

43:04.466 --> 43:07.133
