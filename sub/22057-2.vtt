- No... I don't speak Jersey.

I tuned out at, uh...
"disco fries in AC."

06:02.278 --> 06:04.512
- That what you said?
- That's when you eat a big pile

06:04.514 --> 06:06.614
of french fries
with a bunch of stuff on it

06:06.616 --> 06:07.815

- I'm not making f...

06:14.524 --> 06:16.090

Okay. What is it?

06:16.092 --> 06:18.626

has agreed to bottle water--

06:18.628 --> 06:20.761

for our restaurant.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.864
That's the stupidest
thing you've ever said.

06:23.866 --> 06:25.333
Well, for your information,
water is the key

06:25.335 --> 06:26.667
to good pizza dough, okay?

06:26.669 --> 06:27.935

when we live on an island?
It's not any water.

06:32.575 --> 06:34.308

It's Jersey tap water

06:34.310 --> 06:36.978
that has been pumped
through-through aged pipes

06:36.980 --> 06:39.180

that is perfectly bred

06:39.182 --> 06:40.581

piece of pizza.

06:40.583 --> 06:41.949
You understand? It...
What?!

06:41.951 --> 06:43.217
Don't worry. It's...
well, it's the truth,

veto on this one.

06:49.225 --> 06:50.891

- What do you care?
- Number one, the shipping costs,

07:07.510 --> 07:10.044
but most of all, it's about you
not considering my feelings.

11:13.530 --> 11:15.030
DANNY: Yeah, I agree,
and if that's the case,

11:15.032 --> 11:17.032
I think that what we need
to be focusing on

11:17.034 --> 11:18.233
is where the tip came from.

11:18.235 --> 11:21.069
Well, that Intel came
from Lazio's CI.

11:21.071 --> 11:23.338
Okay, why don't you get him
on the phone.

11:24.775 --> 11:27.309
JERRY: <i>So, I pulled</i>
<i>the HPD crime stats,</i>

11:27.311 --> 11:28.443
and check this out.

11:28.445 --> 11:31.279
Drug busts and O.D. cases
have been spiking

11:31.281 --> 11:32.714
roughly every six weeks.

11:32.716 --> 11:34.983
According to our DEA friends,
Agent Lazio

11:34.985 --> 11:37.218
spotted this trend
and suspected it's connected

11:37.220 --> 11:38.820
to fresh shipments
hitting the island.

11:38.822 --> 11:41.056
Well, Danny and Tani are
down at the docks right now

11:41.058 --> 11:42.590
helping the DEA
coordinate their search.

11:42.592 --> 11:44.693
If there's drugs there,
we're gonna find them.

11:44.695 --> 11:46.728
You know how long
that's gonna take?

11:46.730 --> 11:48.229
Almost everything
on this island

11:48.231 --> 11:49.664
is shipped
from someplace else.

11:49.666 --> 11:53.034
There's gotta be a thousand
containers at the port.

11:53.036 --> 11:54.903
Jerry, do me a favor.

11:54.905 --> 11:56.438
Pull all the incoming activity

11:56.440 --> 11:58.640
at that port
over the last six months.

11:58.642 --> 11:59.975
See if there's any
repeat shipments

11:59.977 --> 12:01.776
that match up with
the spike in drug activity.

12:01.778 --> 12:02.820
You got it.

12:02.844 --> 12:04.447
And, uh, can you do
me another favor?

12:04.448 --> 12:06.815
Check in on Agent
Lazio's dog, Eddie.

12:06.817 --> 12:08.149
Should be coming
out of surgery.

12:08.151 --> 12:09.951
I just want to make sure
he's doing all right.

12:09.953 --> 12:11.119
(cell phone rings)

12:11.121 --> 12:12.587
Thanks.
Agent Reid, hello.

12:12.589 --> 12:14.622
Any word on the CI?

12:16.360 --> 12:18.560
(monitor beeping)

12:23.800 --> 12:25.567
Check for fragments.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.481
Are you the owner?

12:40.984 --> 12:43.118
I'm going to need the owner's
signature on these.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.588
Yeah, that's not
gonna be possible.

12:50.727 --> 12:52.627
Do me a favor.

12:52.629 --> 12:55.130
When you know something,
please call me.

12:59.669 --> 13:02.037
(indistinct shouting)

13:03.540 --> 13:06.007
You sure you got
the right name?

13:06.977 --> 13:09.310
You ain't gotta give
me the stink-eye.

13:09.312 --> 13:11.579
I'm just saying that
whenever I close my eyes

13:11.581 --> 13:15.250
and I think of a low-life,
street-smart drug snitch,

13:15.252 --> 13:16.751
they never look like that.

13:17.854 --> 13:18.953
Come on, guys.

13:18.955 --> 13:21.423
You got this.
You got this. Right there.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.825
(whistle blows)

13:25.529 --> 13:29.130
I'm sorry.
It's just a lot to take in.

13:29.132 --> 13:31.866
No, no, don't, uh...
don't be sorry.

13:31.868 --> 13:35.737
How, uh...
how did you become

13:35.739 --> 13:37.872
Agent Lazio's
informant?

13:40.077 --> 13:42.777
It's not exactly easy
for me to talk about,

13:42.779 --> 13:45.380
but I... I used
to be an addict.

13:45.382 --> 13:47.882
It started with
prescription meds.

13:47.884 --> 13:49.951
Stimulants, mostly.

13:49.953 --> 13:51.719
But then I couldn't
find doctors

13:51.721 --> 13:53.054
to write me
scripts anymore.

13:53.056 --> 13:56.191
That's when you turned
to street drugs, huh?

13:56.193 --> 13:58.426
And when I got popped on my
third possession charge,

13:58.428 --> 14:01.529
I was looking at
mandatory jail time

14:01.531 --> 14:04.432
and the prospect
of losing my kids.

14:04.434 --> 14:06.534
But Lazio stepped in,

14:06.536 --> 14:10.605
and he helped me avoid
prison and keep custody.

14:10.607 --> 14:12.907
Even got me into
this great rehab program.

14:12.909 --> 14:16.578
So, in return, you became
his informant. Is that right?

14:16.580 --> 14:19.114
Yeah, I continued
to make the odd buy.

14:19.116 --> 14:21.716
Used it as an
opportunity to fish

14:21.718 --> 14:23.451
for information from my dealer.

14:23.453 --> 14:25.420
You know, Manny
was kind of sweet on me,

14:25.422 --> 14:27.522
so he was always really chatty.

14:27.524 --> 14:28.957
Manny's the one who...
who gave you

14:28.959 --> 14:30.091
the information
about the shipment?

14:30.093 --> 14:32.760
I went to buy from
him, but he was out.

14:32.762 --> 14:35.430
Said he was waiting to re-up,

14:35.432 --> 14:37.298
but for me to just chill.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.667
There was a load
about to hit port.

14:40.937 --> 14:42.270
Well, Kiana, we believe

14:42.272 --> 14:44.506
that the tip you gave
to Agent Lazio

14:44.508 --> 14:46.708
might have just been
an attempt to set him up.

14:46.710 --> 14:48.343
What do you mean?

14:48.345 --> 14:49.844
STEVE: It's possible
the information

14:49.846 --> 14:51.012
that Manny fed you

14:51.014 --> 14:53.681
was responsible
for Lazio's death.

14:56.586 --> 14:59.587
So this Manny,
what's his last name?

14:59.589 --> 15:02.724
I... He was always just Manny.

15:03.727 --> 15:05.560
But I do know from
our conversations,

15:05.562 --> 15:06.661
when he's not dealing,

15:06.663 --> 15:10.231
he washes dishes down
at this restaurant.

15:12.569 --> 15:14.035
GROVER:
<i>So...</i>

15:14.037 --> 15:16.171
either Manny
the dope-dealing dishwasher

15:16.173 --> 15:17.772
is some kind
of criminal mastermind

15:17.774 --> 15:20.642
who, first of all,
made Kiana as a CI

15:20.644 --> 15:23.912
and then, on top of that,
fed her a false tip...

15:23.914 --> 15:25.513
(sighs)
Or what?

15:25.515 --> 15:28.816
Or the Intel is legit (cell phone ringing)
and the drugs are there.

15:28.818 --> 15:29.884
Yeah. Danny?

15:29.886 --> 15:31.252
DANNY:
All right, we got something.

15:31.254 --> 15:32.887
One of the containers
had its locks clipped.

15:32.889 --> 15:35.256
We know that they were all
locked when they got into port.

15:35.258 --> 15:37.091
It must have happened
right before the raid.

15:37.093 --> 15:38.226
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.562
The thing is, though,
we looked through it, and, uh,

15:40.564 --> 15:41.930
good news--
nothing is missing.

15:41.932 --> 15:44.399
Okay, so what are we thinking?
The crew cut the locks,

15:44.401 --> 15:45.466
but then the DEA showed up

15:45.468 --> 15:46.901
before they had time
to unload the drugs,

15:46.903 --> 15:49.170
so they had to shoot their way
out of there-- is that it?

15:49.172 --> 15:51.406
I guess.
I mean, it looks that way.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.374
In the meantime,
we're gonna double-check.

15:53.376 --> 15:54.642
Tani's gonna go over
the manifest,

15:54.644 --> 15:56.211
make sure everything
is still there.

15:56.213 --> 15:58.246
We got K9s coming down. We got,
uh, portable X-ray scanners.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.848
If there are drugs in this
container, we will find them.

16:00.850 --> 16:02.083
Yeah, I know you will, buddy.

16:02.085 --> 16:04.118
Listen to me. I need you
to do something else.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.221
Make sure you
log every person

16:06.223 --> 16:08.289
that comes in and out of
that port, all right?

16:08.291 --> 16:11.693
If this drug haul
is as big as we think it is,

16:11.695 --> 16:13.494
someone's coming back for it.

16:13.496 --> 16:14.929
All right.

16:20.403 --> 16:22.136
MAN:
<i>Afternoon, gentlemen.</i>

16:22.138 --> 16:24.038
Table for two?
STEVE: Unfortunately, no.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.241
We, uh, need to see
one of your employees.

16:26.243 --> 16:28.543
You got a dishwasher here,
Manny Delarosa-- is he around?

16:28.545 --> 16:30.612
No. Manny missed
his shift today.

16:30.614 --> 16:33.381
I suspect your presence
here might explain why.

16:33.383 --> 16:34.882
What makes you think that?

16:34.884 --> 16:36.818
Well, I knew he was on parole.

16:36.820 --> 16:38.653
Unfortunately,
back-end kitchen positions

16:38.655 --> 16:40.555
aren't anyone's idea
of a dream job.

16:40.557 --> 16:42.657
Let's just say they tend
to attract individuals

16:42.659 --> 16:44.792
from the lower end
of the social spectrum.

16:44.794 --> 16:46.060
Okay, no problem. Look.

16:46.062 --> 16:47.962
You got an address
for Mr. Delarosa?

16:47.964 --> 16:49.998
Of course. If you'll follow me,
it's in my office.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.065
STEVE: Thank you.
GROVER: It's nice.

16:51.067 --> 16:52.267
STEVE: It's very nice,
very nice.

16:52.269 --> 16:53.801
GROVER: It's a really nice
place you got.

16:53.803 --> 16:56.237
You know, my partner
here is thinking

16:56.239 --> 16:58.606
about opening up
his own joint.

16:58.608 --> 17:00.208
Why on earth would you do that?

17:00.210 --> 17:01.809
Excuse me?

17:01.811 --> 17:04.412
Ah... isn't there enough
risk in your life already?

17:04.414 --> 17:06.414
That bad, huh?
WOMAN: Niles?

17:06.415 --> 17:09.284
I don't want to dissuade you,
but it can be a brutal business.

17:09.286 --> 17:12.220
If you're not around 24-7
to oversee operations,

17:12.222 --> 17:13.954
it can go up in flames.

17:13.957 --> 17:15.522
Sometimes literally.

17:15.525 --> 17:17.224
Well, luckily I got
a partner to share

17:17.227 --> 17:19.661
in the responsibilities
and the stress, so...

17:19.663 --> 17:20.795
Well, I've always said,

17:20.797 --> 17:22.896
having a business partner
is like being married.

17:22.898 --> 17:23.579
That's exactly what I say.

17:23.603 --> 17:25.025
- Isn't that what I say?
- That's what you say.

17:25.030 --> 17:26.963
In that half of all marriages
end in divorce

17:26.964 --> 17:28.932
and the other half
are nothing but misery.

17:28.934 --> 17:30.833
(laughing)

17:32.879 --> 17:34.412
I had a partner once.

17:34.414 --> 17:36.047
It lasted all
of 18 months.

17:36.049 --> 17:37.415
What happened to him?

17:37.417 --> 17:38.816
Heart attack.

17:38.818 --> 17:40.318
He was 42.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.553
How old are you?
41. Okay?

17:49.329 --> 17:50.828
I'd offer you
a taste,

17:50.830 --> 17:52.964
but that's a
$200 bottle.

17:52.966 --> 17:54.999
$200-- for one bottle?

17:55.001 --> 17:57.135
Won't see me
and my old lady up in here.

17:57.137 --> 17:59.637
(chuckles)
That's just my cost.

17:59.639 --> 18:01.339
The markup's $500 a bottle.

18:01.941 --> 18:03.408
Everyone knows
the food

18:03.410 --> 18:05.243
is the loss leader
in most restaurants.

18:05.245 --> 18:06.611
Having a well-curated wine list

18:06.613 --> 18:08.646
is key to turning
a healthy profit.

18:08.648 --> 18:11.949
I trust you've already filed
for your liquor license.

18:11.951 --> 18:13.651
Could take a while
to get approved.

18:13.653 --> 18:15.119
Yeah, he-he-he knew about that.

18:15.121 --> 18:17.488
He just wants to consult
with his partner.

18:19.926 --> 18:21.592
Manny Delarosa's
address.

18:21.594 --> 18:23.294
Thanks.

18:25.598 --> 18:27.198
Stop by sometime
when you're off duty.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.399
Meal's on me.

18:28.401 --> 18:29.967
Yeah.

18:29.969 --> 18:31.636
Not the wine, though.

18:33.540 --> 18:35.673
STEVE:
<i>Manny Delarosa, Five-O!</i>

18:35.675 --> 18:37.875
(electronic music blaring)

18:41.181 --> 18:42.413
GROVER:
Steve!

18:45.018 --> 18:46.684
Manny.

18:47.587 --> 18:48.786
Manny.

18:52.425 --> 18:54.025
He's going into cardiac arrest.

18:56.062 --> 18:57.562
This is Captain
Lou Grover.

18:57.564 --> 18:59.397
I got an O.D.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.697
at 427 Kamoku Street,

19:01.698 --> 19:03.131
apartment 602.
Come on.

19:03.132 --> 19:05.367
Come on, Manny.
I need an ambulance sent here right away.

19:05.367 --> 19:08.135
Come on. Come on.

19:20.989 --> 19:22.455
He's gone.

19:25.393 --> 19:28.428
So guy doses
himself to death

19:28.430 --> 19:32.265
two minutes before we knock
on his door to question him.

19:32.267 --> 19:34.300
Seem a little
suspicious?

19:34.302 --> 19:37.103
There's no track marks
on either of his arms.

19:37.105 --> 19:39.739
If you're going
to inject yourself,

19:39.741 --> 19:41.808
you'd use your dominant
hand, wouldn't you?

19:41.810 --> 19:43.610
One would think.
Okay.

19:43.612 --> 19:44.844
Well, he's got his watch
on his right hand,

19:44.846 --> 19:47.347
which suggests to me
he's left-handed,

19:47.349 --> 19:50.884
but the needle was
in his left arm.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.520
Hmm.

19:54.689 --> 19:57.223
Lefty was dosed
by somebody else.

20:00.695 --> 20:02.362
Should've called
my ex-wife.

20:02.364 --> 20:03.997
She loves to break stuff.

20:03.999 --> 20:05.031
Coffee mugs,

20:05.033 --> 20:07.033
ashtrays,
all kinds of stuff.

20:07.035 --> 20:08.601
Nothing?
Not a trace?

20:08.603 --> 20:09.936
Not in this batch.
All right.

20:09.938 --> 20:11.604
There are still some
crates in that container.

20:11.606 --> 20:13.052
I want every last one
opened up and examined.

20:13.076 --> 20:14.108
Okay.

20:14.109 --> 20:16.743
Does that mean you're gonna
break more of my stuff?

20:16.745 --> 20:18.578
Odds are pretty good, yeah.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.079
NOELANI: We'll have to get him
back to the morgue,

20:20.081 --> 20:21.281
but based on what
I'm seeing here today,

20:21.283 --> 20:22.515
it looks like you guys
are right.

20:22.517 --> 20:24.717
Mr. Delarosa's death
was no accident.

20:24.719 --> 20:26.786
He has a head contusion
at the base of his skull

20:26.788 --> 20:28.721
and symptoms
of massive heroin toxicity.

20:29.624 --> 20:31.224
Okay, so somebody
knocked him out,

20:31.226 --> 20:32.826
then gave him a hot shot.

20:32.828 --> 20:33.860
That'd be my best guess.

20:33.862 --> 20:35.328
There was enough heroin
in that syringe

his killer.

20:40.902 --> 20:43.369
Excuse me.
Jerry, what do you got?

20:43.371 --> 20:45.004
I thought you'd want
to know right away

20:45.006 --> 20:47.006
that Lazio's dog, Eddie,
is out of surgery

20:47.008 --> 20:49.342
and is already eating,
which is apparently a good sign.

20:49.344 --> 20:51.110
That's a great sign.
That's great news.

20:51.112 --> 20:52.979
Oh, yeah? Well, it gets better.

20:52.981 --> 20:54.681
The vet pulled foreign blood
from Eddie's mouth.

20:54.683 --> 20:57.016
Seems he got a bite off
one of the drug crew.

20:57.018 --> 20:58.551
We, uh... we run that blood yet?

20:58.553 --> 20:59.552
Indeed, I did.

20:59.554 --> 21:01.221
And it already came back
as a hit.

21:01.223 --> 21:02.322
A guy named Jesse Berman.

21:02.324 --> 21:03.890
I'm sending you his jacket now.

21:03.892 --> 21:05.792
And surprise, surprise--
he's already in the system

21:05.794 --> 21:07.327
for multiple drug offenses.
STEVE: All right, good.

21:07.329 --> 21:09.395
Get an APB out.
On it.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.401
Hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:15.403 --> 21:17.036
Jerry sent us a suspect.

21:17.038 --> 21:18.504
A guy named Jesse Berman.

21:18.506 --> 21:20.206
Wait. Let me see that.

21:20.208 --> 21:21.808
I've seen this guy.
He was just here.

21:21.810 --> 21:23.910
He left with
a truckload of cargo,

21:23.912 --> 21:27.380
but it wasn't from the container
we were looking at.

21:28.216 --> 21:30.717
Hold on a minute.

21:30.719 --> 21:32.986
They didn't have time to get
their stuff off the docks,

21:32.988 --> 21:34.462
so they busted open
a random container.

21:34.486 --> 21:35.422
To throw us off.

21:35.423 --> 21:36.623
TANI: When I said
he was just here,

21:36.625 --> 21:38.558
I mean like ten minutes ago.
We can still get him.

REID: All right,
I'm gonna mobilize

21:39.694 --> 21:41.027
every available unit,
get a chopper in the air

21:41.029 --> 21:42.862

He was gonna shoot.
I had no choice.

24:00.618 --> 24:01.884
Did you get him?

24:01.886 --> 24:02.985
Yeah, he's dead.

24:02.987 --> 24:05.154

of the crew, then.

24:16.768 --> 24:19.068
I heard cocaine could be
smuggled in liquid form.

24:19.070 --> 24:20.970
Oh, yeah. With the right
refinement system,

24:20.972 --> 24:23.539
this could easily be turned
back into powdered form.

24:23.541 --> 24:25.208
Okay, well, let's
say you're right.

24:25.210 --> 24:26.509
How much cocaine?

24:26.511 --> 24:29.212
Well, that depends on the yield
per bottle, but this...

24:29.214 --> 24:30.947
this could be a massive haul.

So far, no leads

he's the mastermind

Right.

26:16.056 --> 26:19.590
And turns out our dead
drug smuggler, Jesse Berman,

26:19.592 --> 26:21.025
he was on Niles' payroll.

26:21.027 --> 26:23.394
CSU searched his car
and turned up heroin

26:23.396 --> 26:25.730
that was a chemical match
to the stuff that killed Manny.

26:25.732 --> 26:27.031
That makes sense, right?

And less than an hour
before the DEA showed up

26:38.311 --> 26:40.044
for the raid,
he got a phone call.

Hey, Noelani, go ahead.

28:25.185 --> 28:26.951

Jesse Berman's autopsy.

28:26.953 --> 28:28.653
He was shot four times.

28:28.655 --> 28:31.022
Three times from a distance
of at least 20 feet.

28:31.024 --> 28:33.157
Once in the shoulder

survived those injuries.

28:34.994 --> 28:36.694
But what about
the fourth shot?

28:36.696 --> 28:37.895
It was fired from less

28:37.897 --> 28:39.096
than two feet away.

28:39.098 --> 28:41.098
A close-range shot
through the heart.

28:41.100 --> 28:42.800

28:57.483 --> 29:00.151

29:00.153 --> 29:02.520
Well, I can think
of two reasons why Reid

29:02.522 --> 29:04.956
would've killed Berman
in cold blood.

29:04.958 --> 29:07.725
Because he wanted revenge
for Lazio's murder or...

29:07.727 --> 29:09.794
Or Jesse was a
threat to him,

29:09.796 --> 29:11.529
so he killed him
to keep him quiet.

29:11.531 --> 29:13.798
And if that's true,
you can bet it was Agent Reid

29:13.800 --> 29:16.467
