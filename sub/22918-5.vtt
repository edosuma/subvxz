Better than that, ma'am.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.600

those details yet, ma'am.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.600
The incident occurred
outside the television studios,

03:49.160 --> 03:53.080
and the perpetrator is now on his way
to the Bow Street Police Station,

03:53.520 --> 03:56.320
where we expect him to be released
without charge.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.920
How very gratifying.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.920
Yes. Very.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.640
Which television studios?

04:04.240 --> 04:06.920
The Independent Television
Network Studios, ma'am,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.440
where Altrincham had
just recorded an interview.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.600
For what?

04:13.160 --> 04:16.880
A program appropriately called  Impact.

04:16.960 --> 04:17.960
When will it air?

04:18.680 --> 04:21.560
Tonight, ma'am. Nine o'clock.

05:01.440 --> 05:04.920
Tonight, we have a man who,
because of press activity in recent days,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.040
probably needs no introduction,
Lord Altrincham.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.440
In the space of just a few days,

05:09.520 --> 05:12.320
his inflammatory
and deeply personal attacks on the Queen

05:12.400 --> 05:14.880
in a periodical of which
he is also publisher,

05:14.960 --> 05:17.120
have become the most pressing issue
of the day

05:17.200 --> 05:19.960
and caused something
of a constitutional crisis.

05:20.040 --> 05:24.280
So, I'd like to begin by asking
Lord Altrincham a simple question.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.120
She's our head of state,

05:26.400 --> 05:28.920
loved, respected and admired
throughout the world,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.920

People are beginning to notice,
and that is why the...

07:08.400 --> 07:10.640
And that is why the ending
of doctrinal tests

07:10.720 --> 07:14.000
and the introduction of women priests
is the only viable solution

07:14.080 --> 07:15.560
for saving the Church of England,

07:16.080 --> 07:17.400
an institution that is becoming

07:17.480 --> 07:20.680
increasingly outdated and irrelevant
hour by hour.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.680
-Oh, divine.
-Much like Patricia herself.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.120

on the church story,

-Something nutty about it?
-Mm, molasses.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.320
And Europe,
we need to work out our official stance.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.800
Are we for or against
a single European market?

-Oh, you must try some, John.

It's not the taste I object to so much.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.280
I just have... painful memories.

08:31.880 --> 08:36.360
As a child, I was sitting
in a dentist's chair

09:37.400 --> 09:39.800

09:45.880 --> 09:47.520
[Adeane] No, I think "average" is fine.

10:01.240 --> 10:03.520
Thought you might be interested
to see this.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.720
It's a draft of the speech the Queen's
going to give in a week's time.

I felt a bit uneasy about it.

beyond my station...

10:38.440 --> 10:40.080
-Tommy.
-Martin.

10:41.160 --> 10:44.000
You were about to interfere
beyond your station.

10:45.800 --> 10:50.000
Uh, [stutters] it's concerning the speech
the Queen is due to give next week

10:50.600 --> 10:52.320
at the Jaguar car factory.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.800
-What about it?
-[Charteris] I was just... wondering

10:55.880 --> 10:57.200
if you were happy with it.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.480
Well, obviously I'm happy with it,

11:02.560 --> 11:04.800
or I wouldn't have shown it
to Her Majesty

11:04.880 --> 11:08.240
for the approval
which she immediately gave.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.920
-Did the Queen read it?
-[Adeane] She didn't need to.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.160
She merely asked if I was happy.
I replied in the affirmative.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.280
-That was good enough for Her Majesty.
-[Lascelles] Hm.

11:21.360 --> 11:25.920
[Adeane] But I can see that
the really important question is,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.800
is it good enough for Colonel Charteris?

11:31.200 --> 11:34.680
You don't think it strikes
the wrong tone?

11:35.240 --> 11:36.680
In which sense?

11:37.280 --> 11:40.440
[exhales] In its... uh, paternalism.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.520
May I?

11:46.280 --> 11:47.120
Thank you.

11:47.640 --> 11:51.240
[stuttering] I suppose
if I had a concern...

11:52.640 --> 11:56.480
it would be that, post-Suez,
in this new climate...

11:57.600 --> 11:58.840
in this new Britain...

12:00.320 --> 12:04.360
the tone of the speech is... somewhat...

12:04.440 --> 12:06.040
Somewhat what?

12:09.560 --> 12:10.720
Old-fashioned.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.800
And would leave her open to attack.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.920
-[Lascelles] From whom?
-The newspapers.

12:19.000 --> 12:19.840
People.

12:19.920 --> 12:23.040
If I had a shilling for every time
someone of a progressive

12:23.120 --> 12:27.040
or liberal disposition had warned
needlessly of a popular attack

12:27.120 --> 12:29.400
against the Crown, I'd be a rich man.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.680
The British people adore their sovereign.

12:31.760 --> 12:35.800
It is what constitutes, indeed defines,
being British.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.040
No, the worst I've ever encountered
is, uh, apathy,

12:39.120 --> 12:41.440
where people simply accept
the King or Queen

12:41.520 --> 12:43.680
as they accept
the sky above their heads.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.320
But it's a long way
from apathy to insurrection.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.240
Now, as regards the newspapers,
the Crown can count on their support

12:51.320 --> 12:54.880
for two reasons:
first, there is nothing to attack.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.480
That's the advantage
of a constitutional monarchy.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.840
They have no power
so there's nothing to complain about.

13:00.920 --> 13:04.160
And even if they wanted to,
they'd always let us know first.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.440
The palace would then
threaten them with a boycott

13:06.520 --> 13:08.360
on the next major royal event,

13:08.440 --> 13:11.440
causing the newspapers immediately
to back down.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.320
Because the very people you fear
will hate the Queen

13:15.880 --> 13:19.280
are the same ones who buy copies
in their millions.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.720
Why? Because they love her.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.120
So I'm worrying unnecessarily?

13:28.200 --> 13:34.520
Martin, I shall leave the drawing
of that inescapable conclusion to you.

13:37.920 --> 13:38.840

13:50.480 --> 13:52.880

[Day] Tonight, we have a man who,
because of press activity in recent days,

29:18.240 --> 29:20.800
probably needs no introduction.
Lord Altrincham.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.560
In the space of just a few days,

29:22.640 --> 29:26.240
his inflammatory
and deeply personal attacks on the Queen,

29:26.320 --> 29:28.680
in a periodical of which
he is also publisher,

29:28.760 --> 29:30.920
have become the most pressing issue
of the day

29:31.000 --> 29:33.760
and caused something
of a constitutional crisis.

29:33.840 --> 29:37.680
So, I'd like to begin by asking
Lord Altrincham a simple question.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.880
She's our head of state,

29:39.960 --> 29:42.320
loved, respected and admired
around the world,

29:42.400 --> 29:45.200
so why do you hate her so very much?

29:45.280 --> 29:47.080
I... I don't.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.760
Then why criticize her like this?

29:49.840 --> 29:53.720
[stutters] That's like asking
an art critic why he criticizes art.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.480
I'm a passionate monarchist

29:55.560 --> 29:58.600
who believes constitutional monarchy
is Britain's greatest invention.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.320
[scoffs] Do you, indeed?

30:00.400 --> 30:03.200
Yes, I do.
I believe that monarchy provides clarity.

30:04.080 --> 30:08.520
A symbolic head of state,
transcending the self-serving interests

30:08.600 --> 30:11.680
of the egocentric
and self-motivated politicians

30:11.760 --> 30:13.840
who go in and out of office,

30:13.920 --> 30:18.600
who, as King Lear wonderfully says,
"ebb and flow by the moon."

30:19.000 --> 30:20.440
But when working at its best,

30:20.520 --> 30:23.920
monarchy can rise above such matters
and unify a society.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.640
It can set the tone and become
the embodiment of the nation,

30:26.720 --> 30:28.400
of national character.

30:28.480 --> 30:31.720
But the problem is, at the moment, it's--
It's not doing that.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.280
It's doing very little right,
as far as you're concerned.

30:34.360 --> 30:35.720
No, that's not true.

30:35.800 --> 30:39.080
You would like to see Her Majesty
endowed with superhuman powers.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.160
It's not superhuman
to be a little spontaneous.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.520
Judging from your article,
you'd like the Queen to have

30:43.600 --> 30:49.080
the qualities of a wit, you'd like her
to be a better orator, a TV personality,

30:49.160 --> 30:53.480
in addition to being a diligent,
dutiful and devoted monarch and a mother.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.960
All I'm suggesting is that,
in her public speeches

30:56.040 --> 30:59.680
and in her appearances,
she should be more, uh, natural.

31:00.480 --> 31:04.720
Her style of speaking is, quite frankly,
a pain in the neck.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.000
She sounds strangled.

31:07.920 --> 31:10.080
I had the misfortune of hearing

31:10.160 --> 31:13.280
one of the Queen's speeches
in a dental waiting room recently.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.680
I was horrified

31:14.760 --> 31:18.440
by the indifference and inertia
with which the speech was greeted.

31:19.080 --> 31:22.280
[Day]  But you'd accept that being Queen
and head of the Church of England

31:22.360 --> 31:25.200
is not an easy job or a simple one?
If you'll forgive me,

31:25.280 --> 31:29.600
it's arguably a harder job
than editing a small periodical.

31:29.680 --> 31:33.920
[laughs]  No, I quite agree. Her Majesty
has a seemingly impossible task.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.520
She has to be ordinary and extraordinary,
touched by divinity and yet one of us,

31:38.600 --> 31:43.880
but being ordinary doesn't have to mean
bland or ineffectual.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.560
Or forgettable.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.120
[Day]  And against whom do you lay
the main charge? Her courtiers?

31:49.200 --> 31:52.880
[Altrincham]  Well, in the end, if the
court is wrong, if the setup is wrong,

31:52.960 --> 31:54.760
you have no choice
but to criticize the boss.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.160
The Queen?

31:56.240 --> 32:00.480
Yes, because only the boss
can get rid of the bad servants.

32:00.560 --> 32:01.720
She hires them.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.720
She alone can fire them.

32:03.800 --> 32:07.360
Now, they may be bad, I believe
some of them at the moment are.

32:07.440 --> 32:12.200
They're quite dreadful, but it is
her responsibility, it's not theirs,

32:12.280 --> 32:14.280
in the sense that they
are just hired hands.

32:14.360 --> 32:17.200
And so the personal attack
on the monarch continues.

32:17.280 --> 32:19.400
[Altrincham]  Let me just say this.

32:19.480 --> 32:23.960
To criticize the monarchy,
to criticize Her Majesty, personally,

32:24.040 --> 32:25.680
gives me no satisfaction.

32:26.120 --> 32:28.440
But we have to remember that,
since the Second World War,

32:28.520 --> 32:32.160
since Suez, Britain has changed
beyond recognition.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.360
And yet the monarchy continues
its pre-war routines

32:35.440 --> 32:37.520
as though nothing has happened.

32:37.600 --> 32:40.320
I believe it would serve the Queen
and her courtiers well to remember

32:40.400 --> 32:44.920
that until recently, monarchies were
the rule and republics the exception,

32:45.000 --> 32:48.800
but today, republics are the rule

32:49.360 --> 32:52.560
and monarchies very much the exception.

32:53.920 --> 32:56.200
[Day]  Lord Altrincham, I have
to terminate the interview.

in real life than I, uh...

33:38.240 --> 33:41.200
-[man 3] Congratulations.
-[man 4] Well done. Well done, sir.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.360
-[Altrincham] A glass of white?
-[man 5] Well done.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.680
Or something stronger?
What about a brandy?

33:45.760 --> 33:46.760
Why not?

33:47.240 --> 33:48.560
Well done.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.000
Humphrey.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.400
Well done. You looked incredibly calm.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.600
-Really?
-Man of the hour. Really.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.840
-Your Majesty.
-Yes, what is it, Michael?

34:11.800 --> 34:14.960
There have been some reactions
in the newspapers

34:15.040 --> 34:19.159
to last night's television interview,
and to the assault upon Lord Altrincham.

34:19.239 --> 34:22.800
[stuttering] I'm afraid it's not quite
as we'd hoped.

34:25.400 --> 34:26.400
[Elizabeth] Why not?

34:27.560 --> 34:30.840
Uh, well, the man that
struck Altrincham, it turns out,

34:30.920 --> 34:36.239
is a member of the extreme right
League of Empire Loyalists,

34:36.720 --> 34:41.560
which is a pressure group that campaigns
against the dissolution of the Empire

34:42.040 --> 34:45.239
and has a clear doctrine
of English racial supremacy.

34:46.280 --> 34:47.120
Oh, dear.

34:48.040 --> 34:51.400
And it seems that most people
have decided,

34:51.480 --> 34:54.159
having watched Altrincham
on the television,

34:54.720 --> 34:58.640
that he is eminently reasonable.

34:59.680 --> 35:05.280
Now, almost half the country appears
to agree with his sentiments,

35:05.360 --> 35:07.520
and there are new polls to support this.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.960
Letters to the  Daily Mirror
are running at four to one

35:11.040 --> 35:12.560
in Altrincham's favor...

35:13.840 --> 35:17.600
and even the normally conservative
Daily Mail...

35:19.120 --> 35:20.440
changed its tune this morning.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.920
Um, in addition,

35:24.000 --> 35:27.760
and this, I believe,
reflects on his growing concern

35:27.840 --> 35:30.640
at some of the telephone calls
he has been receiving...

35:31.600 --> 35:36.800
the Prime Minister has suggested that
he come up a week earlier than planned,

35:36.880 --> 35:40.320
in order to discuss it all
with you in person.

35:40.880 --> 35:44.720
Goodness! A constitutional crisis.

35:45.760 --> 35:48.680
Well, I hope you're going
to apologize to Mr. Macmillan, too.

35:48.760 --> 35:49.600
[Adeane] Ma'am?

35:49.960 --> 35:53.040
You're not going to deny this whole mess
springs from a badly written speech

35:53.120 --> 35:55.720
which I gave, unquestioningly,
because I trusted you.

35:57.800 --> 35:58.880
Perhaps Altrincham's right.

35:58.960 --> 36:01.840
Perhaps I should surround myself
with younger, more dynamic people

36:01.920 --> 36:03.520
with one foot in the real world!

36:05.880 --> 36:06.880
Thank you, ma'am.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.080
And you believe it's now
a government matter?

36:34.760 --> 36:35.840
I do, ma'am.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.600
Ambassadors from all around the world
have been calling me, concerned.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.360
Her Majesty will hardly need reminding
a great many other countries

36:46.760 --> 36:50.320
have overthrown their monarchies
and become republics in recent years.

36:51.040 --> 36:55.840
Egypt, Bulgaria, Italy,
Tunisia only last month.

36:56.640 --> 37:00.360
Of course we're not at that point.
Not at a red light.

37:01.280 --> 37:06.000
We're not even at an amber.
But we'd hate it to become amber.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.600
And so, it is my view,
the government's view,

37:10.680 --> 37:13.720
that it would be wise
to contain this as soon as possible.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.120
-And do what?
-The obvious thing.

37:17.480 --> 37:21.720
Altrincham is a fire
which needs to be put out.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.440
[Charles] Got you! [laughs]

37:29.320 --> 37:31.560
-[both laughing]
-Got you!

37:47.040 --> 37:47.920
[Charles] Got you!

37:56.160 --> 37:58.880
The palace has offered up
a chap called Charteris.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.880
To meet. I looked him up.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.840
He used to be
her principal private secretary.

38:07.280 --> 38:11.040
-Well, there you are.
-Before the King died.

38:12.440 --> 38:15.880
-When she was princess.
-And now?

38:16.480 --> 38:22.440
He's assistant private secretary,
so not quite a pawn,

38:22.520 --> 38:24.880
but certainly not a bishop
or knight, either.

38:25.320 --> 38:26.160
Go.

38:27.280 --> 38:28.760
Go, in order to be fobbed off?

38:28.840 --> 38:31.720
Go in the spirit of openness
and wanting to work together.

38:31.800 --> 38:32.840
If they wanted to work together,

38:32.920 --> 38:35.480
-they would have sent someone higher up.
-Go.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
All right.

38:39.120 --> 38:42.720
And take a list of suggestions.
Recommendations.

38:43.480 --> 38:44.720
Don't go empty-handed.

38:51.920 --> 38:53.200
Not yet! John!

38:53.520 --> 38:55.040
Your tooth! John!

38:56.080 --> 38:56.920
Sorry.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.520
[clamoring]

39:25.040 --> 39:26.760
-[reporter] Do you have a comment, sir?
-Sorry.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.040
[reporter 2] Lord Altrincham!

39:55.720 --> 39:56.600
Lord Altrincham?

39:57.240 --> 39:59.280
-Yes.
-[equerry] This way, please.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.160
Good to know I'm seeing the top man.

40:32.440 --> 40:33.520
In one sense.

40:40.600 --> 40:41.960
Here we are, Lord Altrincham.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.200
Colonel Charteris
will be with you shortly.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.320
-Thank you.
-Sir.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.960
[door opens, closes]

41:11.560 --> 41:15.000
I see we have something in common.

41:16.680 --> 41:18.160
[Elizabeth] And what would that be?

41:23.720 --> 41:24.800
Your Majesty.

41:28.280 --> 41:33.080
[stuttering] I was referring to the photos
of Eton and Sandhurst.

41:33.160 --> 41:36.120
Hm. Which you attended too, I gather.

41:36.680 --> 41:37.640
Yes.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.800
Going on to become
an Officer of the Guards

41:39.880 --> 41:43.560
at both St James's Palace
and Windsor Castle.

41:44.280 --> 41:47.360
It doesn't quite fit the profile
of a revolutionary.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.800
It's the assumption everyone has made.

41:50.880 --> 41:54.600
Because I dare offer an opinion,
I must be trying to burn the temple down.

41:55.720 --> 41:58.680
On the contrary,
I'm trying to make sure it survives.

41:59.480 --> 42:02.160
Well, those of us in the temple
are very much looking forward

42:02.240 --> 42:05.960
to hearing what it is we must do
in order to survive.

42:06.800 --> 42:07.760
Shall we begin?

42:08.160 --> 42:09.160
[Altrincham laughs]

42:11.320 --> 42:15.440
Is my voice all right?
You can understand me?

42:16.560 --> 42:18.840
-[stutters] Yes.
-Not too strangled?

42:19.400 --> 42:21.280
Not too much a pain in the neck?

42:21.920 --> 42:23.680
-No.
-Good.

42:25.440 --> 42:28.840
So, what is it that
you'd have me change?

42:29.440 --> 42:31.600
It's not so much
what I'd have  you  change,

42:32.080 --> 42:34.960
just an acknowledgment
that  it  has changed.

42:35.520 --> 42:38.040
-What?
-Everything.

42:39.520 --> 42:44.200
And to prepare yourself for the fact
we now live in a time where...

42:45.800 --> 42:46.640
people like me--

42:46.720 --> 42:49.760
-Can say exactly what they think.
-Yes.

42:49.840 --> 42:52.640
-In any way they want.
-Yes.

42:52.720 --> 42:56.960
And, remind me, why is that, exactly?

42:58.200 --> 43:00.760
Because the age of deference is over.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.920
And what is left without deference?

43:06.080 --> 43:07.320
Anarchy?

43:07.880 --> 43:08.720
Equality.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.040
How can it be equality
when I cannot return the fire?

43:12.120 --> 43:13.440
You can.

43:13.520 --> 43:16.360
But I struggle to think of a moment
in history where it has worked

43:16.440 --> 43:20.520
to a monarch's advantage
to return fire on their own people.

43:20.600 --> 43:24.080
But you have managed to think
of how this monarch

43:24.160 --> 43:26.520
might do something to her advantage.

43:26.600 --> 43:27.440
I have.

43:27.520 --> 43:31.040
And that same monarch
is sitting before, forgive me...

43:32.600 --> 43:37.160
a failed politician
and an unrecognized journalist...

43:38.120 --> 43:40.960
and taking his advice
on how to do her job.

43:42.520 --> 43:45.800
The situation is as baffling to me
as it is to you, Your Majesty.

44:00.120 --> 44:03.640
-Ah. You've got a list.
-I do.

44:04.040 --> 44:08.760
As you might know from my article,
I made a series of observations,

44:09.040 --> 44:13.040
recommendations of things to change,
but for the purposes of this meeting,

44:13.120 --> 44:17.160
I chose to limit those recommendations
to, um, six.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.200
Six?

44:20.120 --> 44:23.760
Three things to start
and three things to stop.

44:23.840 --> 44:28.120
-Well, let's start with the "stops."
-Very well.

44:28.880 --> 44:33.240
Ah, yes. Putting an end
to the debutantes' ball.

44:34.880 --> 44:39.080
The idea that young women of a certain
class are presented to the sovereign,

44:39.160 --> 44:41.960
and women who are not of that class
are not presented to the sovereign

44:42.040 --> 44:43.680
and somehow not acceptable.

44:44.840 --> 44:47.040
This is the sort of inequity
that should have died out

44:47.120 --> 44:50.880
with our grandparents' generation,
certainly after the war.

44:55.400 --> 44:56.240
Next.

44:59.040 --> 44:59.880
Uh...

45:01.480 --> 45:06.120
Allow divorced people to move more freely
in royal circles.

45:07.320 --> 45:08.160
Why?

45:09.440 --> 45:11.400
The sovereign is head
of the Church of England,

45:11.480 --> 45:14.160
and the Church does not recognize
divorced persons.

45:14.240 --> 45:17.520
It's unkind. Discriminatory.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.560
Quite possibly unlawful.

45:22.280 --> 45:23.120
Next.

45:24.520 --> 45:25.360
Uh...

45:26.520 --> 45:30.240
I would recommend getting rid
of an entire generation of courtier.

45:30.800 --> 45:33.200
The old school, stuck in the past.

45:34.040 --> 45:37.480
Ostriches with their heads buried
in the sand.

45:37.560 --> 45:41.040
They're stopping the palace evolve
in keeping with the rest of the world.

45:41.120 --> 45:46.080
Those "ostriches" provide
an indispensable function of monarchy:

45:46.400 --> 45:48.040
the preservation of tradition.

45:51.400 --> 45:54.080
You asked for my recommendations,
ma'am.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.720
I'm respectfully passing them on.

46:01.360 --> 46:02.720
What would you have me start?

46:04.200 --> 46:05.880
Open up, ma'am.

46:07.160 --> 46:08.400
Lower the drawbridge.

46:09.640 --> 46:10.840
Let people get to know you.

46:10.920 --> 46:12.600
I don't wish to be known.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.920
Televise the Christmas speech.

46:17.920 --> 46:21.160
Become more transparent, accessible.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.800
-And finally...
-Oh, finally.

46:25.880 --> 46:27.920
...spend time with normal people.

46:29.160 --> 46:30.920
Not just courtiers
or the great and the good,

46:31.000 --> 46:33.560
but real people, average people.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.080
Working people.

46:37.280 --> 46:38.600
Open the doors.

46:39.640 --> 46:42.720
Make it more inclusive and egalitarian.

46:44.600 --> 46:47.720
Let normal people get to know you, too.

47:00.280 --> 47:02.520
Would you mind stepping out
into the corridor for a moment?

47:02.840 --> 47:04.880
[stutters] Not at all.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.600
And would you ask
my private secretary to come in?

47:15.600 --> 47:16.600
Of course.

47:23.240 --> 47:24.240
Your Majesty.

47:34.440 --> 47:35.880
[door closes]

47:37.440 --> 47:38.960
[Altrincham] Colonel Charteris?

47:47.560 --> 47:48.760
[Charteris] Your Majesty.

47:49.680 --> 47:50.720
[door closes]

48:00.000 --> 48:01.320
[door opens]

48:03.840 --> 48:05.840
Lord Altrincham. Please.

48:16.640 --> 48:17.800
[door closes]

48:18.800 --> 48:22.240
[Altrincham]  When I went back
into the room, she was gone.

48:23.840 --> 48:25.960
Vanished into thin air.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.160
Do sit down.

48:28.440 --> 48:30.240
[Altrincham] Charteris then went on
to tell me that

48:30.320 --> 48:33.080
no one can ever know that I met the Queen,

48:33.160 --> 48:36.960
and that should I ever claim that I did,
the palace would robustly deny it.

48:38.400 --> 48:40.920
They will, however,
concede that I had an appointment

48:41.000 --> 48:43.400
with Her Majesty's
assistant private secretary,

48:44.120 --> 48:49.080
and that concessions might be made
to one or two of my recommendations.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.040
May I ask which ones?

48:59.000 --> 49:02.240
Let's get these lights in.
Quickly. Easy with that camera.

49:02.320 --> 49:03.160
[man] Right-o.

49:03.840 --> 49:08.040
[producer] This one next. Well done.
Now, let's have the rest of the cables.

49:17.360 --> 49:18.880
[sighs]

49:18.960 --> 49:20.200
I feel like an actress.

49:21.480 --> 49:22.920
A common little showgirl.

49:23.160 --> 49:24.240
Don't be silly.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.360
In what way am I different?

49:28.360 --> 49:33.160
Memorizing lines and remembering angles,
wearing makeup?

49:33.800 --> 49:36.360
Well, you're the Queen
of the United Kingdom for one thing.

49:36.440 --> 49:38.360
[Elizabeth] Yes, who's memorizing lines

49:38.440 --> 49:40.440
and remembering angles
and wearing makeup.

49:45.000 --> 49:45.840
[knock on door]

49:50.920 --> 49:52.120
[producer] Your Majesty.

49:53.280 --> 49:54.120
Right.

49:55.880 --> 49:58.400
-Where do you want me?
-This way, please, ma'am.

50:32.520 --> 50:33.400
[producer] Ma'am.

51:06.080 --> 51:07.840
[inaudible dialogue]

51:14.440 --> 51:17.400
[floor manager] Five, four, three...

51:21.240 --> 51:22.400
Happy Christmas.

51:25.800 --> 51:28.920
Twenty-five years ago,
my grandfather broadcast

51:29.000 --> 51:31.080
the first of these Christmas messages.

51:33.240 --> 51:35.520
Today is another landmark,

51:35.600 --> 51:40.320
because television has made it possible
for many of you to see me in your homes

51:40.400 --> 51:42.080
on Christmas Day.

51:43.360 --> 51:47.120
My own family often gather round
to watch the television,

51:47.200 --> 51:51.400
as they are at this moment,
and that is how I think of you all now.

51:52.160 --> 51:56.600
I very much hope that this new medium
will make my Christmas message

51:56.680 --> 51:58.720
more personal and direct.

52:02.040 --> 52:07.440
It is inevitable that I should seem
a rather remote figure to many of you,

52:08.000 --> 52:11.040
a successor to the kings
and queens of history,

52:11.800 --> 52:16.520
someone whose face may be familiar
in newspapers and films

52:16.600 --> 52:19.680
but who never really touches
your personal lives.

52:21.320 --> 52:24.040
But now, at least for a few minutes,

52:24.520 --> 52:28.320
I welcome you into the peace
of my own home.

52:32.440 --> 52:36.160
That it is possible for some of you
to see me today

52:36.800 --> 52:40.360
is just another example of the speed
at which things are changing

52:40.960 --> 52:42.080
all around us.

52:46.640 --> 52:50.760
I would like to read a few lines
from  Pilgrim's Progress.

52:58.520 --> 53:01.880
'"And though, with great difficulty,
I am got hither,

53:02.560 --> 53:05.880
yet now I do repent me
of all the trouble I have been at

53:05.960 --> 53:07.600
to arrive where I am.

53:08.840 --> 53:13.440
My sword I give to him
that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage

53:14.680 --> 53:18.320
and my courage and skill
to him that can get it.

53:20.200 --> 53:23.680
My marks and scars I carry with me

53:24.800 --> 53:29.480
to be a witness for me
that I have fought his battles

53:29.560 --> 53:31.800
who now will be my rewarder."

53:38.480 --> 53:43.600
I hope that 1958 may bring you
God's blessings

53:43.680 --> 53:45.480
and all the things that you long for.

53:47.760 --> 53:52.880
And so I wish you all, young and old,
wherever you may be,

53:53.440 --> 53:56.840
all the fun and enjoyment and peace

53:57.360 --> 53:59.240
of a very happy Christmas.

54:01.360 --> 54:02.640
[producer] And we're off air.

54:16.480 --> 54:17.800
Congratulations, ma'am.

54:29.520 --> 54:31.520
[chattering]

54:57.480 --> 54:59.080
-[Margaret] Ah, hello.
-My, my.

55:00.800 --> 55:03.160
You look pretty. I like the dress.

55:03.240 --> 55:05.000
-Thank you.
-And the hair.

55:05.080 --> 55:06.400
-Very unregimental.
-Mm, yes.

55:06.480 --> 55:10.280
Tony knew the top person, of course.
The only stylist who could be trusted.

55:11.080 --> 55:13.000
Does he have a name, this stylist?

55:13.920 --> 55:16.160
I want to say Victor Gabon,
but that's not quite right.

55:16.240 --> 55:17.160
Um...

55:18.240 --> 55:19.080
Vidal Baboon?

55:19.160 --> 55:20.760
-Vidal Baboon?
-Yes, I think.

55:20.840 --> 55:23.880
Well, anyway, he talked endlessly
about hair as a geometric art form.

55:23.960 --> 55:25.480
-It looks jolly pretty.
-Thank you.

55:25.560 --> 55:29.320
If you happen to have a number for this
Baboon, I might pass it on to my wife.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.880
Is that appropriate, by the way,
that a red-blooded man

55:32.960 --> 55:34.720
should know the correct hairdresser
for a woman?

55:34.800 --> 55:37.400
There's almost nothing
that's appropriate about Tony,

55:37.480 --> 55:40.360
but he's made it his mission in life
to improve me.

55:40.440 --> 55:41.320
[Philip] Mm.

55:42.120 --> 55:44.800
-Your very own little Altrincham.
-Yes.

55:44.880 --> 55:46.760
Just rather better in bed, I suspect.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.880
-Oh, dear God.
-Look at them.

55:52.960 --> 55:54.640
[chattering]

55:57.720 --> 55:59.640
-There it is.
-[man] Thank you very much.

56:02.240 --> 56:03.480
Who do you suppose that is?

56:04.040 --> 56:06.760
It could be Mr. David Smith, a car dealer.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.520
-[Elizabeth] And that?
-[Queen Mother] I believe...

56:12.600 --> 56:16.640
that is Harry "The Hammer" Jones.

56:17.320 --> 56:19.480
A boxer from the Old Kent Road.

56:22.560 --> 56:25.920
Rounding up the numbers,
we have a local restaurateur,

56:26.000 --> 56:27.320
a bus driver,

56:27.400 --> 56:29.240
a bank clerk...

56:30.240 --> 56:32.120
and a woman policeman.

56:34.320 --> 56:35.640
All to open things up.

56:35.720 --> 56:36.560
Yes.

56:36.640 --> 56:39.760
Bring us more in line with the real world.
Democratize us.

56:41.920 --> 56:43.240
And so it goes.

56:45.040 --> 56:48.800
The stings and bites we suffer
as it slips away.

56:50.080 --> 56:52.560
Bit by bit, piece by piece.

56:54.040 --> 56:59.680
Our authority, our absolutism,
our divine rights.

57:00.600 --> 57:02.520
[footsteps approaching]

57:02.600 --> 57:04.160
[footman clears throat] Ma'am?

57:07.800 --> 57:10.000
[Queen Mother] The history
of the monarchy in this country

57:10.080 --> 57:13.160
is a one-way street of humiliation,
sacrifices and concessions

57:13.240 --> 57:14.640
in order to survive.

57:15.280 --> 57:18.400
First, the barons came for us,
then the merchants, now the journalists.

57:18.480 --> 57:22.160
Small wonder we make such a fuss
about curtsies, protocol and precedent.

57:22.240 --> 57:23.520
It's all we have left.

57:23.600 --> 57:28.400
The last scraps of armor as we go
from ruling to reigning to--

57:30.240 --> 57:32.280
-To what?
-To being nothing at all.

57:36.040 --> 57:37.360
Marionettes.

57:43.760 --> 57:46.720
-Right, gloves on.
-Ah.

57:49.440 --> 57:53.000
I told the master of the household
to rotate the guests between courses,

57:53.080 --> 57:56.560
so if you get a dud, don't worry,
it'll be 15 minutes at worst.

58:01.960 --> 58:03.080
[Queen Mother sighs]

58:17.760 --> 58:18.800
Mr. and Mrs. David Smith.

58:18.880 --> 58:20.920
-Ah, David. Lovely to meet you.
-Ma'am.

58:21.040 --> 58:22.720
-Hello.
-Very nice to meet you.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.800
-Mr. and Mrs. Patel.
-[Elizabeth] Hello there.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.240
Thank you for coming.

58:26.320 --> 58:29.320
-Mr. Harry "The Hammer."
-[Elizabeth] I've heard so much about you.

58:29.400 --> 58:31.840
-Thank you for coming.
-You look absolutely beautiful.

58:31.920 --> 58:32.920
Mr. Martin Jones.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.600
[speaking indistinctly]

58:36.720 --> 58:38.720
-Sergeant Ethel Danmyer.
-Ah, hello there.

58:39.160 --> 58:41.240
-Such a pleasure to have you here.
-[corgis barking]

58:41.320 --> 58:44.080
Oh, here they come, dog-dogs.
There they go. [laughs]
