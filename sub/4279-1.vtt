01:13.648 --> 01:15.081
Any progress, Eric?

01:15.353 --> 01:18.155
Sorry, Professor Kaufman. There's still
something wrong with the program.

01:18.322 --> 01:23.485
We can't do any more experiments
with the laser until you boys fix it.

01:23.848 --> 01:25.281
We know. We know.

01:25.473 --> 01:27.654
Hey, wait! I've found something.

01:28.425 --> 01:31.283
- What?
- Who turned on the laser?

01:31.848 --> 01:33.440
Not me!

01:34.408 --> 01:38.401
- Shut it down!
- I can't! It's not responding!

01:51.156 --> 01:55.583
- What is that?
- I was hoping you'd know, professor.

02:10.324 --> 02:14.408
- He's absorbing all our computer data.
- Call security!

02:33.765 --> 02:37.634
- Like, are we there yet, Fred?
- I told you, Shaggy, soon.

02:37.888 --> 02:40.561
But you said that an hour ago, man.

02:41.528 --> 02:44.675
It's so impressive that Eric got
a grant for his computer project.

02:44.888 --> 02:49.359
Doesn't surprise me. Back in high school, he
practically lived in the computer lab. Right, Velma?

02:49.648 --> 02:53.960
- Yeah. He's one smart cookie.
- Cookie? Cookie?!

02:54.168 --> 02:57.604
Sorry, Scooby. Figure of speech.

02:58.008 --> 03:02.399
Cheer up, Scoob. When we get there,
we'll get to play the game Eric designed.

03:02.608 --> 03:06.567
- I bet it's way cooler than this one.
- Yeah, cooler!

03:06.808 --> 03:09.242
Imagine a computer game starring all of us!

03:09.448 --> 03:11.962
Solving mysteries in cyberspace.

03:18.382 --> 03:22.553
Like, I hope I do better
on Eric's game than this one.

03:50.208 --> 03:52.278
Where do you think you're going?

03:52.488 --> 03:55.480
To visit our friend Eric Staufer.
He's a student here.

03:55.672 --> 03:58.936
Not if you're not on my list.

03:59.323 --> 04:02.456
It should be under "Fred Jones".

04:02.968 --> 04:04.926
- Is this whole group with you?
- Yes, sir.

04:05.128 --> 04:09.246
- Including the dog?
- Dog? Where?

04:12.648 --> 04:15.401
There you are.
But just so you know...

04:15.478 --> 04:19.527
...I don't like a bunch of punks
running around my university.

04:19.688 --> 04:22.885
- Your university?
- It might as well be.

04:23.088 --> 04:27.878
I've been here for 20 years. There's
never been any trouble on my watch.

04:28.088 --> 04:32.047
I'm the head of security.
Wembley's the name.

04:35.808 --> 04:39.562
- Twenty years is an impressive record.
- You bet it is.

04:39.808 --> 04:42.527
I want to make sure that it stays...

04:45.888 --> 04:48.243
A wise guy, eh?

04:48.637 --> 04:51.883
I'm keeping a special eye
on you, pooch!

04:52.048 --> 04:53.197
Pooch?

04:53.683 --> 04:57.832
- Like, Scooby's just playing, officer.
- Yeah, sorry.

04:58.199 --> 05:01.242
We just need some help
finding the computer lab.

05:02.335 --> 05:05.038
The lab is three buildings
down on the left.

05:05.528 --> 05:09.726
- Thanks.
- And keep your dog off the grass.

05:17.208 --> 05:21.121
Wow, Eric, this lab
is one groovy setup.

05:22.648 --> 05:24.445
We like it too.

05:29.774 --> 05:31.274
You don't want to eat those.

05:31.648 --> 05:33.557
Because they're grown in radioactive soil.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.520
Zoinks!

05:39.543 --> 05:41.868
- Everyone, this is my lab partner, Bill McLemore.
- Nice to meet you.

05:42.088 --> 05:45.285
Thanks for keeping Shaggy and Scooby
from glowing in the dark.

05:45.488 --> 05:49.766
- We'll go to dinner after the tour.
- But first, can you show us your new video game?

05:50.008 --> 05:52.203
Scoob and I have been dying to play it.

05:52.408 --> 05:57.118
No one is playing the game
until we get rid of our problem.

05:57.528 --> 06:00.838
Professor Kaufman, I'd like you to meet the
mystery gang I based my game on.

06:01.088 --> 06:03.326
- Oh, hi!
- Nice to meet you.

06:03.608 --> 06:05.997
The famous Mystery, Inc.

06:06.208 --> 06:08.483
And that's Scooby-Doo.

06:17.008 --> 06:21.001
It looks like you showed up
just in time for a mystery.

06:22.635 --> 06:24.326
- A mystery?
- Why? What happened?

06:24.568 --> 06:26.479
This is a hyper-energy laser.

06:26.682 --> 06:30.436
We've been using it to break down actual objects
and project them into cyberspace.

06:30.608 --> 06:35.807
Jinkies! You mean you can transport objects
from the real world into the computer world?

06:36.008 --> 06:40.160
- Precisely, young lady.
- That's fantastic!

06:40.736 --> 06:44.436
It was, until the laser beamed
a monster into our world last night.

06:45.748 --> 06:47.884
A monster?!

06:50.107 --> 06:54.024
Yes, the laser beamed a computer virus
right here into this lab.

06:54.208 --> 06:56.164
A really freaky-looking thing.

06:56.368 --> 06:59.838
He erased all the computers' data
by just walking near them.

07:00.858 --> 07:05.744
This virus is also able to control
and manipulate electrical objects.

07:06.327 --> 07:09.125
- But where did it come from?
- Eric's computer game.

07:09.408 --> 07:13.526
Computer viruses don't just appear.
They have to be created by someone.

07:13.808 --> 07:17.847
- But I didn't create it!
- I'm sure it wasn't Mr. Staufer.

07:18.048 --> 07:22.007
But whoever created this virus
is in serious trouble.

07:22.208 --> 07:26.167
Our civilization is
so dependent on technology...

07:26.368 --> 07:29.678
...that this virus is a threat
to the entire world.

07:30.852 --> 07:32.774
Can you show us how the laser works?

07:32.968 --> 07:36.165
You can show the demo,
but don't start the game!

07:36.367 --> 07:37.952
Yes, sir.

07:48.745 --> 07:52.486
Like, check it out! We're digital!

07:52.688 --> 07:54.156
Yeah! Digital!

07:54.608 --> 07:58.283
We used the game to extrapolate
3- D data into quantum particles.

08:02.808 --> 08:05.959
- Of course, it's so simple!
- It is?

08:06.208 --> 08:11.407
He used the Scooby game as the location in
cyberspace to store physical objects.

08:11.787 --> 08:15.426
- And you're sure the virus came from the game?
- Unfortunately, yes.

08:15.648 --> 08:19.800
There's no virus in my baseball game,
and it's more entertaining.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.766
<i>Batter up!</i>

08:26.528 --> 08:28.598
<i>Strike one!</i>

08:28.808 --> 08:32.721
- Now, this is a game you can get into.
- That's really cool, Bill.

08:32.928 --> 08:36.364
- I'm a huge baseball fan myself.
- You have good taste, Fred.

08:36.568 --> 08:40.243
- I think it's the greatest sport in the world.
- Baseball's okay...

08:40.475 --> 08:43.525
- ... but it doesn't have Scooby and me in it.
- That's right!

08:43.727 --> 08:47.880
The Scooby game has 10 levels.
You battle monsters or villains...

08:48.128 --> 08:51.404
...while trying to find
Scooby Snacks on each level.

08:51.728 --> 08:54.288
Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks!

08:56.736 --> 08:58.675
Okay, Professor.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.357
Now, check out the monitor.

09:16.888 --> 09:17.718
- Cool!
- Jinkies!

09:17.928 --> 09:21.045
I wouldn't believe it
if I didn't see it with my own eyes!

09:21.335 --> 09:24.576
Like, I don't believe it either.

09:25.928 --> 09:28.557
We didn't even get one Scooby Snack.

09:31.263 --> 09:34.038
Eric and Bill are sure to win
the $250,000 grand prize...

09:34.288 --> 09:37.837
- ... at the international science fair.
- Wow, that's some prize.

09:38.088 --> 09:42.400
It'll be a reward for their talent
and hard work on the laser project.

09:42.608 --> 09:46.726
We couldn't have done it without you, prof.
Kaufman. You should share the reward too.

09:46.928 --> 09:50.284
No, no. As a teacher,
being able to guide young minds...

09:50.488 --> 09:54.037
...to their full potential
is reward enough, Eric.

09:54.248 --> 09:58.764
Speaking of rewards, is it possible to get
the Scooby Snacks out of the game?

10:12.448 --> 10:15.246
- Groovy!
- Oh, boy!

10:15.728 --> 10:17.525
- Hey, that's mine!
- No, mine!

10:17.728 --> 10:19.241
Mine!

10:19.425 --> 10:22.363
Is that the way the virus
came out of the game, Eric?

10:22.488 --> 10:24.399
Yeah. It was pretty scary.

10:24.608 --> 10:28.567
If it's just a computer virus,
what harm can it do in our world?

10:28.768 --> 10:32.283
From what we observed the last night,
this virus has the potential...

10:32.488 --> 10:35.560
...to steal every
computer program in the world.

10:35.643 --> 10:39.727
And the virus made the telephone
come to life, which attacked Eric.

10:43.208 --> 10:46.803
<i>It kept coming toward us
and we couldn’t't stop it. </i>

10:52.768 --> 10:56.443
<i>When I held up a magnetic bar
in defense... </i>

10:57.587 --> 11:01.321
<i>... it seemed to have
an adverse effect on the virus. </i>

11:02.683 --> 11:06.474
<i>Yeah. It seemed like the magnet weakened
him. Like kryptonite to Superman. </i>

11:12.568 --> 11:14.047
- Wow!
- Creepy!

11:14.161 --> 11:18.035
The security guards checked the campus,
but couldn't find him anywhere.

11:18.164 --> 11:23.568
I suspect that he is still
in this building somewhere.

11:24.153 --> 11:25.816
Still here?

11:25.968 --> 11:28.607
No more arguing, boys.

11:29.368 --> 11:32.201
So what can we do to help, Eric?

11:32.448 --> 11:35.565
If you can lure the Phantom Virus
into the lab...

11:35.631 --> 11:38.915
...I can use the laser to beam him
back into cyberspace.

11:39.056 --> 11:42.643
Great. Like, you want us
to be virus bait?

11:42.808 --> 11:46.743
- Like, no way, man.
- Uh-uh.

11:46.888 --> 11:50.164
Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?

11:50.847 --> 11:55.631
Hold on, Scoob. Only one Scooby Snack
to go chase a phantom?

11:55.808 --> 11:57.639
I don't think so.

11:57.848 --> 12:01.045
What if I gave you each
two Scooby Snacks?

12:05.648 --> 12:07.240
Okay, you got a deal.

12:07.888 --> 12:09.879
Go long, guys!

12:15.648 --> 12:19.960
This place is so big, we'll probably
never see this virus anyway.

12:22.328 --> 12:25.764
How do we capture the Phantom Virus
once we find him?

12:25.968 --> 12:29.881
The Phantom Virus is composed
of electromagnetic energy.

12:30.088 --> 12:34.366
Get close enough to him
with one of these super-magnets...

12:34.538 --> 12:37.567
...and it will render him helpless.

12:47.152 --> 12:50.738
Be careful, Scooby.
Those are pretty strong magnets.

12:51.528 --> 12:52.722
Sorry!

12:52.928 --> 12:57.718
- Now let's really put them to the test.
- I knew I could count on you guys.

13:02.408 --> 13:06.003
This building is so big!
This Phantom Virus could be anywhere.

13:06.248 --> 13:09.604
I think we stand a better chance
of finding it if we split up.

13:12.648 --> 13:15.367
Hey, you guys, I didn't say how
we were gonna split up.

13:15.608 --> 13:18.839
Like, do we ever do it any other way?

13:25.553 --> 13:28.105
Do we really have to look in the basement?

13:28.248 --> 13:32.287
We have to search the whole building,
top to bottom.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.887
This stuff looks like it should be
in the Smithsonian.

13:37.088 --> 13:39.556
Why do they bother keeping this old junk?

13:39.768 --> 13:44.683
Oh, I don't know. Some of this
old junk could be very valuable.

13:47.648 --> 13:49.604
Jinkies! It's him!

13:52.164 --> 13:55.680
- Uh-oh!
- Watch out!

14:06.848 --> 14:08.247
The magnets!

14:10.968 --> 14:14.961
Get back, you... creepy... thingy!

14:16.745 --> 14:18.417
"Creepy thingy"?

14:20.008 --> 14:21.964
You'll pay for this!

14:22.288 --> 14:23.960
We don't think so.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.721
Thingy!

14:33.048 --> 14:34.686
After him!

14:46.008 --> 14:49.398
- I wonder why they left?
- I don't know.

14:49.768 --> 14:53.602
Man, it's bad enough we're
always chasing real ghosts.

14:53.816 --> 14:57.275
Now we're chasing
computer-generated ones.

14:59.745 --> 15:02.662
It's a good thing phantoms
don't care about lunch.

15:12.688 --> 15:14.963
Santa Claus!

15:21.088 --> 15:22.646
I think we lost him.

15:22.848 --> 15:24.600
Wait! Look!

15:25.968 --> 15:27.037
What do we do?

15:27.248 --> 15:30.445
Get as close to him as possible
with our magnets.

15:33.088 --> 15:37.081
Ready? One, two, three!

15:39.528 --> 15:42.998
I thought I heard
some noise down here.

15:43.208 --> 15:46.120
What are you kids doing?
The basement's for staff only.

15:46.328 --> 15:48.523
We're hunting for the Phantom Virus.

15:48.728 --> 15:51.959
Yeah, I heard about
this so-called virus.

15:52.168 --> 15:54.682
I think it's some kind of a college prank.

15:54.825 --> 15:56.883
No, Officer Wembley. You see, we...

15:57.048 --> 16:00.358
You kids are coming with me back
to Kaufman's lab.

16:04.168 --> 16:07.638
Can you believe the cafeteria
ran out of food?

16:07.848 --> 16:11.636
- And we're still hungry.
- Yeah. Hungry!

16:18.733 --> 16:22.005
I think I saw a vending machine
down the hall.

16:22.168 --> 16:24.762
What is it, Scoob?
Oh, hello, Mr. Phantom.

16:24.844 --> 16:26.382
Zoinks!

16:40.168 --> 16:43.365
Thank you for volunteering
for our experiment, Mr. Virus.

16:43.648 --> 16:48.853
- Nurse, take the patient over to the table.
- Okay. This way, please.

16:50.048 --> 16:51.242
Sit down.

16:54.008 --> 16:55.760
Just relax.

16:58.688 --> 17:02.966
Now, can you tell us how many layers
are in an ideal club sandwich?

17:04.407 --> 17:08.037
Time's up. The correct answer is,
"Never enough! "

17:11.367 --> 17:13.234
Let's try one more.

17:13.488 --> 17:17.367
When's the best time to enjoy
a milkshake with your french fries?

17:17.928 --> 17:21.284
Time's up. The answer is, "Anytime! "

17:26.608 --> 17:28.246
Yikes!

18:33.137 --> 18:36.853
I'm worried about Shaggy and Scooby.
They've been gone for a long time.

18:37.225 --> 18:39.568
Maybe we should go look for them.

18:39.774 --> 18:43.542
Nobody goes anywhere
until Professor Kaufman gets back.

18:49.888 --> 18:52.197
- What was that?
- It's the Phantom!

19:32.488 --> 19:37.243
Jinkies! It looks like we've been
beamed into Eric's computer game.

19:39.526 --> 19:40.725
- What?
- The laser's been fired.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.038
At that Phantom Virus, I hope.

19:46.128 --> 19:48.881
I don't think so. Look here.

19:49.088 --> 19:52.717
Your friends have been transported
into cyberspace!

19:53.635 --> 19:56.672
So? Throw a switch or something
and get them out.

19:56.768 --> 20:00.363
But thing doesn't work that way. They have to
play through all the levels to get out.

20:00.568 --> 20:03.104
- You're kidding me.
- I wish he was.

20:03.688 --> 20:05.846
Until they can get out
by winning every level of the game...

20:06.048 --> 20:10.438
- ... the danger is very real.
- Danger?

20:11.577 --> 20:14.256
Check this out. I'm, like, a superhero!

20:14.373 --> 20:18.440
Be careful, Shaggy.
There's less gravity on the moon.

20:19.528 --> 20:22.165
Look! It's Super-Shaggy!

20:25.358 --> 20:28.112
Scooby, could you get Shaggy back here
before he hurts himself?

20:30.328 --> 20:32.444
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

20:35.368 --> 20:39.964
Nice try, Scoob!
Like, catch me if you can.

20:44.953 --> 20:49.225
- Shaggy, are you all right?
- I think so.

20:49.442 --> 20:51.526
- But I made an important discovery.
- What's that?

20:51.608 --> 20:54.566
In this video game, you can get hurt.

20:54.642 --> 20:58.421
Or worse. We'd better be careful.

20:58.768 --> 21:03.717
Velma's right. Eric said this game
has creatures and who knows what else.

21:04.088 --> 21:06.477
Zoinks! I know who!

21:06.846 --> 21:10.481
- Oh, no!
- He must've gotten beamed into the game too.

21:15.768 --> 21:17.407
Yikes! Help!

21:17.726 --> 21:20.115
Oh, no! He's not alone.

21:22.366 --> 21:24.561
Let's play ball!

21:24.766 --> 21:26.836
Like, let's not!

21:27.863 --> 21:31.124
- I thought we were chasing him.
- Back at the lab, we were.

21:31.366 --> 21:36.565
- But here in the game, he's got friends.
- They don't look very friendly to me.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.042
I think we lost them.

21:41.846 --> 21:45.839
You know, getting beamed into cyberspace
might not be such a bad thing.

21:46.086 --> 21:48.156
- And how's that, Velma?
- Yeah!

21:48.364 --> 21:52.492
Maybe if we play along, we can
find out who created this virus.

21:52.646 --> 21:55.240
Right! Maybe we can find some clues.

21:55.474 --> 21:59.521
Remember what Eric said?
We need to find the box of Scooby Snacks.

21:59.726 --> 22:02.240
And, like, there it is!

22:05.126 --> 22:06.525
Wow, that was easy.

22:06.726 --> 22:10.321
It's only the first level of the game.
It's supposed to be easy.

22:10.526 --> 22:12.164
Over there!

22:13.362 --> 22:15.115
Oh, no! Here they come!

22:15.286 --> 22:17.277
- Look, a rover!
- Huh?

22:17.486 --> 22:21.081
- A moon rover!
- And what a cool paint job!

22:21.653 --> 22:24.067
Come on, guys!

22:26.846 --> 22:29.201
This thing needs new shocks!

22:29.406 --> 22:33.001
As long as it gets us away
from those moon goons, who cares?

22:33.362 --> 22:34.078
Oh, no! They've got
a set of wheels too!

22:43.326 --> 22:44.839
Zoinks!

22:45.166 --> 22:47.680
Step on it, Freddy! They're gaining on us!

22:47.886 --> 22:51.720
I am, but this is as fast as it goes.

22:55.686 --> 22:57.677
Man, he got us!

22:58.126 --> 23:01.118
It's okay, guys.
The Scooby Snacks are right there.

23:02.846 --> 23:05.360
Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks!

23:06.846 --> 23:08.484
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

23:08.966 --> 23:10.604
Go, Scooby, go!

23:16.966 --> 23:18.319
Yikes!

23:21.966 --> 23:24.321
Stop that dog!

23:27.086 --> 23:29.361
Come on, Scoob! You can do it, pal!

23:30.086 --> 23:31.724
- Hi!
- Watch out!

23:49.366 --> 23:51.243
What happened to...?

24:01.726 --> 24:03.842
- What?
- Where are we now?

24:04.086 --> 24:09.080
If I'm not mistaken,
we're inside the Roman Colosseum.

24:10.206 --> 24:12.925
- Colosseum?
- Like, where they play football?

24:13.166 --> 24:15.600
Not exactly. In ancient Rome...

24:15.686 --> 24:20.351
...people used to gather in the Colosseum
to watch all kinds of events.

24:20.744 --> 24:22.078
You mean like sports and music?

24:22.251 --> 24:25.543
Yeah, they did that too. But the Colosseum
is famous as the place...

24:25.674 --> 24:28.065
...where Romans fed people
to the lions for lunch.

24:28.226 --> 24:30.796
- Lions?
- Well, it looks deserted now.

24:31.086 --> 24:36.285
Speaking of lunch, we didn't even get to keep
the Scooby Snacks from the moon level.

24:37.486 --> 24:41.877
Don't worry, Scoob. I bet there's
a concession stand somewhere.

24:42.486 --> 24:45.956
- What's this?
- What are these white lines for?

24:47.766 --> 24:48.915
Like, it's chalk!

24:49.526 --> 24:52.324
Yikes! Virus!

24:53.446 --> 24:58.361
Welcome to level two, game players,
where things get a little tougher.

24:58.566 --> 25:03.765
But first, let me introduce you
to the home team!

25:16.637 --> 25:20.144
Those guys look like
they've got a bone to pick, huh, Scoob?

25:20.855 --> 25:24.176
Don't worry, gang. We can beat
those meatless gladiators.

25:24.575 --> 25:27.843
And now for the home team's mascot.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.556
The lion's got the Scooby Snacks!

25:33.937 --> 25:37.643
You know, for once, I'm not in the mood
for Scooby Snacks.

25:37.766 --> 25:39.358
Me neither!

25:44.875 --> 25:46.723
Yikes!

25:47.543 --> 25:50.332
- Good idea, Scooby!
- Come on, Shaggy!

25:57.606 --> 26:02.202
- Are you all right, Shaggy?
- Yeah. But I'm really tangled up.

26:06.326 --> 26:09.363
- A chariot.
- Good thinking, Scoob!

26:09.566 --> 26:10.919
Thank you.

26:12.486 --> 26:14.636
Faster, Scoob! Faster!

26:20.766 --> 26:23.644
Yikes! Like, hit the turbo, Scoob!

26:26.166 --> 26:30.478
Good work, guys! You handle the gladiators,
and we'll take care of this lion.

26:31.766 --> 26:34.599
How exactly are we going to do that?

26:34.846 --> 26:37.997
- Give me your jacket.
- But I just bought this.

26:38.206 --> 26:41.278
- Daphne!
- Oh, all right.

26:41.686 --> 26:42.835
Here.

26:43.766 --> 26:46.758
I know this isn't red,
but it'll have to do.

26:49.046 --> 26:50.718
<i>Toro! Toro!</i>

26:50.719 --> 26:51.719
Leo! Leo!

27:01.726 --> 27:03.205
Olé!

27:03.486 --> 27:06.603
- That was too close.
- I have an idea.

27:14.566 --> 27:15.885
Leo! Leo!

27:18.886 --> 27:20.239
Now!

27:23.246 --> 27:25.237
Way to go, girls!

27:26.246 --> 27:28.157
- Thanks.
- This will hold him.

27:30.286 --> 27:34.074
- That was very brave, Freddy.
- Thanks.

27:35.244 --> 27:37.463
Here's your jacket.

27:38.246 --> 27:41.522
Shaggy and Scooby need our help!
Come on!

27:56.326 --> 27:57.805
Zoinks!

28:04.606 --> 28:06.039
Good going, guys!

28:06.532 --> 28:08.863
Yeah, whatever.

28:09.485 --> 28:13.356
Keep those gladiators busy just a little
bit longer. I'll get the Scooby Snacks.

28:13.562 --> 28:16.541
- That's easy for you to say, man.
- Yeah!

28:16.726 --> 28:21.516
- Try to lead them up into the stands.
- I don't think we have the energy.

28:21.726 --> 28:24.081
But, maybe we do!

28:27.046 --> 28:29.799
- Here.
- What are we supposed to do with these?

28:30.262 --> 28:34.754
- Use them to pole-vault over the wall.
- Like, and then what?

28:35.011 --> 28:36.885
Never mind.

28:49.806 --> 28:52.843
Friends, Romans and spooky gladiators.

28:53.046 --> 28:56.004
All hail Emperor Scooby!

29:33.886 --> 29:35.842
So where are we now?

29:36.326 --> 29:40.319
- Looks like a jungle of some kind.
- It's gorgeous here.

29:40.526 --> 29:44.565
I'll say. This place beats
ancient Rome any day, eh, Scoob?

29:55.485 --> 29:57.485
Oh, no! This is a prehistoric jungle!

29:57.486 --> 30:02.435
I take back what I said.
Rome is lovely this time of year.

30:03.166 --> 30:04.884
Look over there!

30:14.366 --> 30:16.279
What's that?!

30:17.206 --> 30:20.004
How's this for a heavy hitter?

30:20.286 --> 30:23.039
Jinkies! He's riding a T. rex!

30:27.846 --> 30:31.759
Let's head for the trees.
It's too thick for them to follow.

30:48.366 --> 30:51.756
- That was a close one.
- They're doing pretty good so far.

30:52.324 --> 30:54.275
I'm wondering something here, fellas.

30:54.406 --> 30:57.684
Who activated that laser and sent
those poor kids into the game?

30:57.966 --> 31:00.639
Who knows? Could be anyone.

31:00.846 --> 31:04.964
Even someone in this very room.

31:10.006 --> 31:14.602
We hiked through miles of jungle
and still can't find the Scooby Snacks!

31:14.806 --> 31:18.799
We'd better, otherwise we'll
be stuck in this level forever.

31:19.006 --> 31:23.238
All I know is that this virus likes
to scare us in cyberspace...

31:23.486 --> 31:25.363
...as much as in the real world.

31:32.506 --> 31:37.358
Nice work, guys. Which one of you
did the drawing over there?

31:41.474 --> 31:42.718
- Not me.
- Not me.

31:43.163 --> 31:47.246
- It looks like a volcano.
- I wonder if it means anything.

31:47.966 --> 31:50.082
Oh, no! The fire's going out.

31:51.086 --> 31:52.917
It's gonna be dark in a few hours, too.

31:53.126 --> 31:56.755
Scooby and Shaggy, it's your turn
to get the firewood.

31:58.046 --> 32:01.243
- All right. Come on, Scoob.
- Okay.

32:05.163 --> 32:08.426
Like, just a few more sticks,
and we can head back, Scoob.

32:11.632 --> 32:13.045
- Smoke!
- Smoke?

32:13.166 --> 32:18.035
Zoinks! Up there!
Like, all the trees are burning!

32:20.732 --> 32:23.436
Like, where did that come from?

32:24.784 --> 32:26.041
Volcano.

32:30.758 --> 32:35.174
Forget the wood, Scoob.
We've gotta warn the others.

32:40.046 --> 32:43.004
What happened, guys?
Where's the firewood?

32:43.206 --> 32:47.358
Like, if we don't get out of here soon,
we're all gonna be firewood.

32:47.642 --> 32:50.374
- What are you talking about, Shaggy?
- Volcano!

32:50.526 --> 32:52.278
Volcano?

32:56.286 --> 32:59.084
Great! It looks like
it's really cooking.

33:02.643 --> 33:06.521
I bet that's where
the Scooby Snacks are.

33:06.606 --> 33:09.803
That drawing is a clue
to lead us to the Scooby Snacks!

33:10.006 --> 33:13.396
But it's miles away.
It'll take us hours to get there!

33:13.606 --> 33:17.076
- Where there's a will, there's...
- Woolly mammoths?

33:22.566 --> 33:26.798
Mammoths didn't live in the same
age as dinosaurs, but I'm not complaining!

33:27.006 --> 33:30.681
I am! I wish Eric had put
saddles on these guys.

33:30.886 --> 33:32.877
I can't take much more of this.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.244
I wish he'd made them
smell better too.

33:37.086 --> 33:42.080
- How are you guys doing?
- Like, do you have an airsickness bag?

33:45.361 --> 33:48.783
Well, hang on, guys.
We're almost there.

33:59.846 --> 34:04.078
- Any sign of the Scooby Snacks?
- Like, all I can see is smoke.

34:04.286 --> 34:05.639
And lava!

34:10.351 --> 34:13.012
Look up there!

34:13.565 --> 34:17.764
- That poor baby pterodactyl's trapped.
- Poor little guy.

34:18.886 --> 34:23.721
- The volcano's erupting again.
- No. We've got company!

34:29.744 --> 34:31.553
Start climbing!

34:35.646 --> 34:37.284
Yikes!

34:53.076 --> 34:57.183
I think we're safe. T. rex is built
for running, not climbing.

35:00.846 --> 35:04.555
Look! The mama pterodactyl
is trying to save its baby.

35:07.784 --> 35:11.846
- Hey! Where are you going, Scoob?
- Be careful, Scooby!

35:17.486 --> 35:19.078
Hello!

35:33.486 --> 35:34.601
Scooby Snacks!

35:45.537 --> 35:47.778
He found the Scooby Snacks!

38:29.806 --> 38:32.274
I think we're finally home.

38:32.846 --> 38:36.998
No more monsters chasing us.
Let's celebrate with some chow.

38:39.726 --> 38:43.133
It might be a little early
for a celebration, gang.

38:43.454 --> 38:44.577
Look.

38:45.846 --> 38:48.679
Aw, man, we're still in the game.

38:48.886 --> 38:51.798
And I thought we were home free.

38:52.566 --> 38:54.841
Okay. They've made it to the last level.

38:55.086 --> 38:59.204
But this one's the toughest of all.
No player's ever won it. Not even me.

38:59.846 --> 39:02.360
It'll take everything they've got
just to survive.

39:04.006 --> 39:04.995
So now what?

39:05.055 --> 39:07.823
All we have to do is find
the last box of Scooby Snacks.

39:07.926 --> 39:11.475
But this city is so big.
Where do we start?

39:13.086 --> 39:15.725
Let's see if that woman
knows anything.

39:20.553 --> 39:24.126
- Excuse us, ma'am, we were wondering...
- Surprise!

39:25.573 --> 39:29.245
- The virus!
- Welcome to the final level.

39:29.447 --> 39:32.674
You're in the major leagues now.

39:33.366 --> 39:35.561
Run!

39:39.863 --> 39:43.985
- Like, where are we going?
- Hey, let's hide in the malt shop.

39:44.020 --> 39:45.122
Great idea, Freddy!

39:50.926 --> 39:52.757
Can someone help us?

39:56.406 --> 39:57.395
Zoinks!

39:57.606 --> 40:01.155
- You're me.
- And, like, you're me.

40:04.347 --> 40:08.518
- You're the characters in Eric's video game!
- And you're from the real world.

40:08.606 --> 40:10.244
Jinkies!

40:12.753 --> 40:15.034
Did I really wear that years ago?

40:15.256 --> 40:18.363
That jacket with that skirt?

40:20.806 --> 40:23.764
- Nice ascot.
- Works for me.

40:45.744 --> 40:50.273
I guess it's been a while since we've seen Eric.
He hasn't seen our fashion changes.

40:50.864 --> 40:54.142
- We'll go shopping later.
- Like, why don't you join us for a little snack?

40:54.206 --> 40:56.436
Man, I thought you'd never ask!

40:22.673 --> 40:24.902
Here you go, pal.

40:24.937 --> 40:27.132
Thanks a lot.

41:39.774 --> 41:44.356
We don't have time to play around. We need
to find the Scooby Snacks and get out of here.

41:44.653 --> 41:47.356
- You guys need to relax.
- Yeah! What are you worried about?

41:47.446 --> 41:49.357
Aren't you afraid
of the Phantom Virus?

41:49.566 --> 41:51.761
Phantom who?
Never heard of him.

41:51.966 --> 41:54.924
- You're kidding.
- Oh, I get it.

41:55.126 --> 41:57.401
The virus isn't part of this game.

41:57.606 --> 42:00.325
He has no reason to look
for our cyber doubles.

42:00.526 --> 42:02.676
You cyber-guys are lucky.

42:02.886 --> 42:07.323
The Phantom Virus is creepy
and has this really scary laugh.

42:09.832 --> 42:11.231
Just like that.

42:11.432 --> 42:13.741
Come out and play!

42:19.552 --> 42:20.541
It's him!

42:20.752 --> 42:22.947
Come out, come out.

42:25.792 --> 42:28.864
Let's get out of here.
The Mystery Machine's out back.

42:29.112 --> 42:30.591
- I'll drive.
- I'll drive.

42:34.712 --> 42:37.943
This is nostalgic.
I miss this old van.

42:38.467 --> 42:41.645
In cyber-world,
things never get old. It's pretty cool.

42:41.792 --> 42:49.445
There's a lot to like in cyber-world.
Stores, theaters, parks... and lots of tasty food.

42:50.512 --> 42:52.946
What about the monsters and villains?

42:53.152 --> 42:57.111
We haven't seen any.
They're probably guarding the Scooby Snacks.

42:57.312 --> 42:59.985
You mean you guys don't know
where the Scooby Snacks are?

43:00.245 --> 43:04.623
We know where they are. There's just
no reason to go after them.

43:04.712 --> 43:09.661
Because even if we get the Scooby Snacks,
we just go right back to the beginning of the game.

43:09.853 --> 43:11.315
And we like it here.

43:11.472 --> 43:15.351
Until you guys showed up
with that Phantom Virus, that is.

43:15.552 --> 43:18.703
- We'd gladly get rid of him for you.
- If we could.

43:18.912 --> 43:21.221
You know,
if all ten of us team up...

43:21.432 --> 43:24.151
...the Phantom Virus
wouldn't stand a chance.

43:26.832 --> 43:30.222
I guess we were gonna go
after the snacks eventually.

43:30.432 --> 43:32.468
- So you'll help?
- Count us in.

43:32.872 --> 43:35.181
Well then, let's go.

43:45.952 --> 43:48.068
Well, here we are.

43:57.552 --> 43:59.907
Man, this place is awesome!

44:00.512 --> 44:02.980
So where are the Scooby Snacks?

44:03.372 --> 44:07.734
On the Scooby game, of course.
Right inside the video arcade.

44:08.712 --> 44:10.270
What's that sound?

44:11.072 --> 44:12.903
There it is again.

44:13.512 --> 44:16.265
- Baseball.
- Cyber-Scooby is right.

44:16.472 --> 44:18.269
There's a batting cage over there.

44:23.673 --> 44:26.015
Wow, that guy is really
clobbering the ball.

44:26.192 --> 44:28.387
Hey, man. Great swing.

44:28.672 --> 44:31.391
Thanks! Want my autograph?

44:33.072 --> 44:35.586
Let's play ball!

44:38.912 --> 44:41.745
Everybody make a run
for the video arcade!

44:47.272 --> 44:50.184
Creeper!

44:52.952 --> 44:56.262
- Jeepers! It's the Creeper!
- The what?

44:56.472 --> 45:00.863
- He's one of the villains from our past.
- And he's got a pet.

45:04.637 --> 45:08.145
It's Jaguaro.
He's supposed to be in Brazil.

45:14.832 --> 45:17.027
Gator Ghoul and the Tar Monster?

45:20.552 --> 45:21.985
Head for the beach!

45:25.192 --> 45:27.342
No way. Look!

45:29.462 --> 45:31.237
It's Old Iron Face!

45:36.834 --> 45:39.344
Man, you guys know
some strange people.

45:39.643 --> 45:41.753
It's like every villain
we've ever faced is here!

45:41.952 --> 45:45.467
Maybe we shouldn't have told Eric
so much about our mysteries.

45:45.672 --> 45:48.869
How right you are, my dear.

46:04.032 --> 46:05.181
Wait a minute.

46:05.392 --> 46:09.988
All these creatures in the real world
turned out to be just people in costumes.

46:10.192 --> 46:13.104
Velma's right. They were all fakes.

46:13.592 --> 46:16.902
Nice try, Phantom Virus.
But you can't fool us.

46:30.432 --> 46:32.582
Tough time with the mask, guys?

46:32.912 --> 46:35.267
He's real!

46:38.272 --> 46:41.344
That means that they're all real!

46:46.632 --> 46:49.066
Creeper!

46:49.632 --> 46:51.588
Yikes!

47:01.352 --> 47:02.580
Get them!

47:03.072 --> 47:04.471
Let's split up, gang.

47:04.672 --> 47:06.390
- Right.
- Okay, Freddy.

47:14.672 --> 47:18.062
Step right up and test your strength.

47:19.192 --> 47:21.752
How about you, handsome?

47:22.853 --> 47:25.263
- Me?
- Yes, you, sir!

47:25.432 --> 47:28.035
Let us show you how easy it is.

47:32.792 --> 47:35.989
Creepy. Why'd you pick
this place to hide?

47:36.192 --> 47:38.228
Me? I was following you.

47:38.673 --> 47:42.844
If you thought this wasn't a good place,
you should've said something.

47:44.653 --> 47:46.230
Where did that come from?

47:46.536 --> 47:48.895
These fun houses have
all sorts of trap doors.

47:52.272 --> 47:54.866
Let's keep an eye open for more.

47:59.912 --> 48:01.504
Oh, no!

48:03.253 --> 48:04.505
What's wrong?

48:05.552 --> 48:09.545
- Look how fat I am!
- It's just a trick mirror.

48:10.032 --> 48:13.423
- You look perfect.
- Oh, thanks. You too.

48:15.512 --> 48:17.389
Creeper!

48:22.712 --> 48:25.863
- Keep away from us!
- What do we do?

48:31.352 --> 48:33.582
Sorry. You're not our type.

48:36.992 --> 48:38.710
Creeper.

48:40.552 --> 48:42.747
Way to go, girl!

48:46.754 --> 48:48.363
He's climbing back up!

48:53.963 --> 48:56.749
That door won't hold him long.

48:57.672 --> 48:59.121
Hey! Where are you?

48:59.312 --> 49:00.825
Come on!

49:05.152 --> 49:08.324
- Is he still behind us?
- Yep.

49:11.152 --> 49:14.303
That walking handbag
will reach us any minute now.

49:21.512 --> 49:22.706
Look!

49:27.312 --> 49:29.951
- What do we do now?
- Jump!

49:30.192 --> 49:34.470
- What?! We must be five stories high!
- Down there!

49:36.912 --> 49:40.348
One, two, three. Go!

49:48.512 --> 49:50.230
That was some jump.

49:52.792 --> 49:55.590
But it beats getting eaten
by an alligator.

49:55.792 --> 49:57.271
Just barely.

50:03.152 --> 50:05.871
See you later, alligator!

50:06.552 --> 50:10.909
- These wax figures are pretty creepy.
- At least they're not real.

50:14.792 --> 50:16.066
Hey, what's that?

50:16.542 --> 50:19.124
This must be where
they make the wax figurines.

50:19.232 --> 50:21.324
That one looks like...

50:22.312 --> 50:25.384
Old Iron Face! Jinkies!

50:25.592 --> 50:27.628
Let's get out of here.

50:27.629 --> 50:28.629
- Oh, no! My glasses!
- Mine too!

50:42.312 --> 50:43.791
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

50:51.352 --> 50:55.789
The wax is hardening. He can't move.

50:57.112 --> 51:00.661
Yes, he can. Let's get out of here!

51:50.232 --> 51:51.984
Great work, Scoobs.

51:56.712 --> 51:58.907
Don't be scared. It's just us.

52:05.192 --> 52:07.148
I thought we lost him.

52:21.392 --> 52:22.905
Go, Shaggys!

52:23.192 --> 52:27.822
- The Tar Monster is right behind us.
- And boy, is he mad!

52:30.032 --> 52:31.431
Let's get out of here!

55:07.357 --> 55:09.442
Look.

55:21.392 --> 55:23.348
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

55:32.672 --> 55:35.550
- Scooby-Doos!
- Where are you?

55:35.792 --> 55:37.350
I wonder where they are.

55:37.632 --> 55:40.100
- Over here.
- There they are!

55:40.312 --> 55:42.143
Come on, Scooby.

55:47.844 --> 55:50.973
Now that we're all here,
we've got one last monster to face.

55:51.592 --> 55:53.583
The Phantom Virus.

55:53.784 --> 55:56.856
And this is the final level,
so the virus won't be easy to beat.

55:57.753 --> 55:59.911
What's this? Zoinks!

55:59.912 --> 56:02.221
I've still got the magnet
Professor Kaufman gave me.

56:02.424 --> 56:06.683
You had that magnet with you
all this time and forgot about it?

56:06.912 --> 56:09.267
Guess I was too busy being scared.

56:11.152 --> 56:12.904
What's wrong with cyber-Shag?

56:21.576 --> 56:23.214
What's going on here?

56:23.352 --> 56:28.551
The cyber-gang is made of electromagnetic energy
and therefore affected by the magnet.

56:28.653 --> 56:30.534
Just like the Phantom Virus.

56:32.832 --> 56:37.144
- What's this about a magnet?
- We have a way to beat the virus now.

56:37.352 --> 56:41.061
And we know he's guarding
the Scooby Snacks in there.

56:43.632 --> 56:47.068
- We need your gang to stay here.
- You don't want us help to help you?

56:47.312 --> 56:49.826
We wouldn't want you
to get hurt by the magnet again.

56:49.984 --> 56:53.875
- Magnet? What are you talking about?
- Oh, never mind.

56:59.352 --> 57:03.061
Man, this is one great video arcade.

57:05.712 --> 57:10.911
- Just keep an eye open for the virus.
- Look. There's the Scooby-Doo video game.

57:11.232 --> 57:16.226
- And the Scooby Snacks!
- Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks!

57:17.952 --> 57:19.226
Yikes!

57:24.352 --> 57:27.549
Like, I hear him, but I don't see him.

57:34.632 --> 57:37.465
Ready to play some games?

57:46.252 --> 57:48.151
Shaggy, the magnet!

57:49.392 --> 57:50.950
Oh, right!

57:53.072 --> 57:57.384
- You need to get closer!
- Like, that's easy for you to say.

57:57.454 --> 58:02.143
- Then toss the magnet over here.
- With pleasure.

58:03.392 --> 58:04.984
Hey, Mr. Zappy!

58:10.152 --> 58:13.189
It's working! Scooby, go grab the snacks.

58:13.392 --> 58:14.381
Okay.

58:17.753 --> 58:21.215
Hurry, Scooby! I don't know how much
longer this is gonna work!

58:27.745 --> 58:28.864
Oh, no!

58:29.243 --> 58:31.384
Oh, tough break.

58:37.856 --> 58:39.116
- Freddy!
- Freddy!

58:45.752 --> 58:47.708
Not again!

58:57.272 --> 58:59.740
If you thought my hitting was good...

58:59.952 --> 59:02.591
...wait till you see my pitching.

59:08.232 --> 59:10.382
What do we do now?

59:12.764 --> 59:16.674
- Looks like they're in trouble!
- Like, we've gotta do something.

59:16.832 --> 59:18.221
Right! Let's go help them.

59:23.712 --> 59:25.784
Oh, no! They're back!

59:32.385 --> 59:33.643
Oh, no!

59:48.672 --> 59:49.946
Scooby?

59:51.785 --> 59:53.968
- Cyber-Scooby?
- That's right!

59:54.432 --> 59:57.061
It's no use.
We need some wire cutters.

01:02.846 --> 01:05.975
- I got an idea. Want to help?
- Okay.

01:06.138 --> 01:08.035
Great. Here's the plan.

01:18.426 --> 01:00:19.864
Over here.

01:00:21.192 --> 01:00:23.245
What are you doing, Scooby?

01:00:28.832 --> 01:00:30.663
Scooby, get back here!

01:00:30.912 --> 01:00:33.949
You're down to your final out.

01:00:37.912 --> 01:00:41.029
I've never seen Scooby so brave.

01:00:41.272 --> 01:00:45.390
Oh, I get it! That's Cyber-Scooby.

01:00:45.674 --> 01:00:49.391
And that's old Scoob
going for the snacks.

01:00:49.472 --> 01:00:51.547
Meddling canine!

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:55.181
Yikes!

01:00:57.632 --> 01:00:58.781
Help!

01:01:10.872 --> 01:01:12.669
All right, Scoob!

01:01:36.152 --> 01:01:39.542
You did it!
You beat the Phantom Virus.

01:01:40.352 --> 01:01:41.844
Great job, guys!

01:01:51.552 --> 01:01:53.065
It looks like we're leaving.

01:01:55.672 --> 01:02:00.462
Are you sure you want to split?
There's a lot of cyber-buffets to try.

01:02:00.672 --> 01:02:02.902
Yeah! Okay!

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:05.507
Sorry, but we have to go.

01:02:09.512 --> 01:02:13.107
- I guess this is goodbye.
- Bye!

01:02:13.392 --> 01:02:15.110
Thanks for all the help!

01:02:24.152 --> 01:02:25.710
Bye, Scooby.

01:02:38.752 --> 01:02:42.665
You're back! I thought you'd be
stuck in the game forever.

01:02:42.872 --> 01:02:44.908
There's no place like home.

01:02:45.792 --> 01:02:48.386
- Everyone okay?
- I think so.

01:02:48.573 --> 01:02:53.058
Well done! You've saved the world
from a terrible menace.

01:02:53.232 --> 01:02:57.387
- But did you find out who created the virus?
- We've got a pretty good idea.

01:02:57.564 --> 01:03:02.342
Good. Because whoever created
the virus must be punished.

01:03:02.527 --> 01:03:06.876
Glad you agree, Professor, because you're
as much a suspect as anyone here.

01:03:06.953 --> 01:03:09.679
What? Me? But I'm a scientist!

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:13.344
I've dedicated my life
to my students and this university.

01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:17.178
But you also stood to make $250,000
at the science fair.

01:03:17.356 --> 01:03:19.674
If you stole the invention.

01:03:19.709 --> 01:03:21.028
Preposterous!

01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:24.227
And let's not forget Officer Wembley.

01:03:24.429 --> 01:03:28.547
What? I'm an officer
of the law! Sort of.

01:03:28.749 --> 01:03:31.946
Anyway, I've never committed
a crime in my life!

01:03:32.189 --> 01:03:36.501
You were the only person that was with us
in the lab when we got sent into the game.

01:03:36.644 --> 01:03:40.745
But once inside the game,
we found some important clues.

01:03:40.769 --> 01:03:45.259
Our first clue came when we were on the moon level.
The Phantom Virus shouted, "Play ball! "

01:03:45.469 --> 01:03:49.985
And on the Colosseum level, we found some
chalk lines like a large diamond.

01:03:50.189 --> 01:03:52.942
But our biggest clue
was on the final level.

01:03:53.189 --> 01:03:56.306
When the Phantom Virus
appeared in a batting cage.

01:03:56.446 --> 01:04:00.543
All I'm getting is that the virus
had a thing for... Baseball!

01:04:00.869 --> 01:04:02.063
Bill!

01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:04.539
Not so fast, kid!

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:20.754
Okay, son, it's all over.

01:04:21.989 --> 01:04:25.664
- Bill, you were my best friend.
- And my best student.

01:04:25.665 --> 01:04:26.665
- But you didn't pick my project.
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:04:29.149 --> 01:04:34.223
Professor Kaufman chose your video design
over mine even though I've been here 2 years longer.

01:04:34.429 --> 01:04:36.784
Students are all equal, Bill.

01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:41.898
So you invented the Phantom Virus,
hoping it would scare Eric away.

01:04:42.048 --> 01:04:45.844
That's right. And it worked,
till you guys showed up.

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:49.339
You were afraid that we would find out
who created the virus.

01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:52.109
So you beamed us into cyberspace.

01:04:52.463 --> 01:04:55.374
The prize would've been all mine,
if it wasn't for...

01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:57.744
Us meddling kids!

01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:06.268
I want to thank you for getting rid
of the Phantom Virus. Lunch is on me, guys.

01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:11.669
- In that case, I'll have another cheeseburger.
- Two cheeseburgers!

01:05:11.869 --> 01:05:12.904
No problem.

01:05:13.149 --> 01:05:15.663
I'm sorry you guys got trapped
in cyberspace.

01:05:15.989 --> 01:05:18.822
- Well, it really wasn't all that bad.
- Really?

01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:21.065
Going back in time was really fun.

01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:23.869
You did a great job
designing all the game levels.

01:05:23.985 --> 01:05:28.244
- Thanks, Daphne.
- But next time, go easier on the monsters.

01:05:31.245 --> 01:05:35.975
Hey, Shaggy, I just pulled up the Scooby-Doo
video game on my laptop. Want to play?

01:05:36.543 --> 01:05:38.064
What do you say, Scoob?

01:05:38.109 --> 01:05:41.499
Now that there's
no creepy virus in the game.

01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:45.468
Haven't you had enough for one day?

01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:48.780
Zoinks! Look!

01:05:53.509 --> 01:05:55.101
What are you doing, Scoob?

01:05:58.745 --> 01:06:01.214
Now that's what I call hacking!

01:06:01.429 --> 01:06:04.341
Hacking and Scooby-Snacking!

01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:07.586
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:27.185
I may be a bit of a bookworm,
but I've got a wild side too.

That's why my favorite part of the
<i>Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase</i>...

01:09:30.788 --> 01:09:36.022
...was shooting in the prehistoric jungle.
It brought out the animal in me.

01:09:39.788 --> 01:09:43.337
This one likes me.
Look how calm he is.

01:09:43.788 --> 01:09:45.108
Jinkies!

01:09:47.868 --> 01:09:48.938
Thanks, Scooby.

01:09:53.948 --> 01:09:56.622
Hey, Velma, that one likes you too.

01:09:58.155 --> 01:10:01.845
<i>Trying to tam those wolly mammoths
was like a prehistoric rodeo. </i>

01:10:02.144 --> 01:10:06.025
<i>Shaggy found out what
it was like to be a real cowpoke.</i>

01:10:06.389 --> 01:10:11.224
<i>And after a little practice, Scooby
and I started the first cattle drive. </i>

01:10:14.349 --> 01:10:17.659
My dream of playing
pro baseball ended pretty early.

01:10:17.869 --> 01:10:21.578
But another dream of mine came true
when we made the movie.

01:10:21.789 --> 01:10:24.622
Fred Jones, gladiator.

01:10:27.069 --> 01:10:32.063
- You look so cute in that outfit, Freddy.
- Cute? That's not what I was going for.

01:10:35.349 --> 01:10:37.101
You can beat him, Fred!

01:10:41.648 --> 01:10:44.983
All that Frisbee-playing
with Shaggy really paid off.

01:10:46.454 --> 01:10:48.975
I was amazed how acting like
Shaggy helped me during battle.

01:10:49.172 --> 01:10:53.847
I lured my opponents into traps,
jumped high when I was scared...

01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:57.545
...and most importantly,
ran really fast.

01:10:57.546 --> 01:10:58.546
Just because I wear nice clothes
and like to shop...

01:11:00.977 --> 01:11:02.746
doesn't mean I don't have
a sense of adventure.

01:11:02.989 --> 01:11:05.583
That's why I enjoyed
shooting at the North Pole.

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:09.136
Besides, when it's 40 below,
no one cares what you're wearing.

01:11:09.469 --> 01:11:14.179
- The air is so cold.
- You gotta keep moving around.

01:11:14.469 --> 01:11:19.347
- Shaggy and Scooby have the right idea.
- They're doing Arctic aerobics.

01:11:19.869 --> 01:11:21.188
Like, help!

01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:32.040
- Nice work, Daphne.
- Now you know why I accessorize.

01:11:32.469 --> 01:11:36.257
If you're exploring the Arctic,
you need to make sacrifices.

01:11:36.509 --> 01:11:40.821
Your shelter must be practical,
you need to travel light...

01:11:41.484 --> 01:11:45.532
...and most importantly,
enjoy the 24 hours of sunlight.

01:11:46.509 --> 01:11:48.818
The part I enjoyed most
about this movie...

01:11:49.029 --> 01:11:52.180
...was all the time Scooby and I
got to spend at the arcade.

01:10:58.784 --> 01:11:00.849
Like, there's only one thing I love more
than playing games, and that's winning at 'em.

01:11:58.989 --> 01:12:00.945
One more point and I win.

01:12:04.349 --> 01:12:08.945
Game over, Scoob. Like, I'm the
air-hockey champion of the world!

01:12:15.109 --> 01:12:16.508
Two out of three?

01:12:17.593 --> 01:12:23.109
I could have been a better sport,
or at least not gotten so excited.

01:12:23.564 --> 01:12:26.325
But when I rubbed it in
after beating him at free throws...

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:29.148
...Scooby made a winning shot
of his own.

01:12:29.349 --> 01:12:33.740
Your time, Scoob. What was your favorite part
of <i>Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase</i> ?

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:35.502
The laser.

01:12:37.467 --> 01:12:40.742
Like, I got it. Fire away, Scoob.

01:12:49.472 --> 01:12:53.229
Zoinks! It's amazing what you
can find on the Web. Eh, Scoob?

01:12:58.309 --> 01:13:01.269
We visited the
Scooby Snacks home page...

01:13:01.346 --> 01:13:03.680
...found a great Web site
for dessert...

01:13:03.809 --> 01:13:07.165
...which I found out
was spelled with two S's.

01:13:07.769 --> 01:13:11.148
And best of all, we got to see
an old friend, right, Scoob?

01:13:11.349 --> 01:13:14.386
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
