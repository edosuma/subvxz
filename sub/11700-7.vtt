WEBVTT

00:01.182 --> 00:03.283
- (Video games noises)
- All right, you think you got moves?

00:03.318 --> 00:05.119
- Well, you're not gonna see this coming.
- (Explosion)

00:05.153 --> 00:06.387
- Oh! Yeah!
- Oh, come on!

00:06.421 --> 00:09.356
(Laughs) Sorry, kinda saw that coming.

00:10.725 --> 00:13.127
Speaking of things blowing up in
your face that everyone saw coming,

00:13.161 --> 00:15.963
- I heard you messed it up with Riley again.
- I didn't mess up...

00:15.997 --> 00:17.931
Unless she said I messed up...

00:17.966 --> 00:20.634
In which case, that's messed up!

00:20.668 --> 00:22.736
She just said you guys
were figuring things out,

00:22.771 --> 00:25.372
which I assumed was code for
"Ben screwed it up again."

00:25.407 --> 00:27.441
I think there were other factors involved,

00:27.475 --> 00:30.377
and by "other factors," I mean people.

00:30.412 --> 00:33.347
Okay,
but I'm guessing the other people's name

00:33.381 --> 00:34.314
- is Ben.
- (Explosion)

00:34.349 --> 00:36.350
- Aw, come on!
- (Laughs) Yeah.

00:36.384 --> 00:39.086
- I win again.
- Yeah, whatever. You always win.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.255
- Ben, zero. Danny, a gajillion.
- (Scoffs)

00:42.257 --> 00:43.957
Dude, calm down. It's just a game.

00:43.992 --> 00:45.826
- It's not just a game!
- It was.

00:45.860 --> 00:47.861
Now it's just weird.

00:47.896 --> 00:48.962
Rematch?

00:48.997 --> 00:50.597
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:52.534 --> 00:56.837
Well, boys, I thought I had scraped
the bottom of the loser barrel,

00:56.871 --> 01:01.208
but tonight's date proved that
the barrel has a false bottom,

01:01.242 --> 01:02.609
and it's name was Doug.

01:04.245 --> 01:06.280
I mean, it's one thing to live in your car,

01:06.314 --> 01:08.415
but with a roommate? I mean, come on!

01:09.984 --> 01:12.052
And of course,
he spent the whole night looking at these

01:12.086 --> 01:14.888
and not this, and after I spent an hour

01:14.923 --> 01:16.957
telling him about my
exciting real estate career,

01:16.991 --> 01:18.959
he asked me how long I'd been a lawyer!

01:18.993 --> 01:22.663
I tell you, men never listen!

01:23.765 --> 01:25.666
Hey, mom. How was your date?

01:25.700 --> 01:27.835
(Theme music playing)

01:27.869 --> 01:30.971
<i>♪ It's amazing how the unexpected ♪</i>

01:38.980 --> 01:41.782
Ben: So what? You won a game of basketball.

01:41.816 --> 01:44.718
Why don't you try something more challenging,
like baby making?

01:44.752 --> 01:46.653
Beaten you at that, haven't I?

01:46.688 --> 01:47.821
I'm not sure

01:47.856 --> 01:48.989
forgetting to put on a condom

01:49.023 --> 01:50.624
and getting a girl pregnant is

01:50.658 --> 01:52.526
the big win you think it is.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.561
That's real nice, Uncle Danny.

01:54.596 --> 01:55.796
Real nice.

01:55.830 --> 01:58.699
Hey, mom, we're just dropping Emma...

01:58.733 --> 02:01.635
- (Hisses)
- Mmm.

02:01.669 --> 02:03.704
Mom, what happened to you?

02:03.738 --> 02:05.506
I've completely given up.

02:05.540 --> 02:07.908
I'm swearing off men. Isn't it great?

02:07.942 --> 02:10.943
No makeup, hairdos, or bathing.

02:10.979 --> 02:13.780
I'm basically living the life of a dude.

02:14.849 --> 02:17.684
No wonder you guys have so
much free time to be idiots.

02:17.719 --> 02:19.553
(Hisses)

02:20.855 --> 02:22.656
Now if you'll excuse me,

02:22.690 --> 02:25.726
I'm gonna go drink beer in my bathtub,

02:25.760 --> 02:27.928
because I can. (Giggles)

02:30.431 --> 02:32.533
Hey, dude, I think mom's broken.

02:32.567 --> 02:35.569
You know, I've seen this before.

02:35.603 --> 02:36.670
You know what mom's problem is?

02:36.704 --> 02:39.106
Oh my God, there's something more than this?

02:39.140 --> 02:40.507
She needs to meet a decent guy,

02:40.542 --> 02:42.142
and I know a ton of guys.

02:42.176 --> 02:43.443
At least one's gotta be decent.

02:43.478 --> 02:46.146
No offense, bro,
but I think mom's looking for a relationship

02:46.180 --> 02:48.115
that doesn't end in
"we're figuring things out."

02:48.149 --> 02:49.983
Oh. You think you could do better?

02:50.018 --> 02:51.885
In a word, yeah, why not?

02:51.920 --> 02:53.954
Okay, then you're on.

02:53.988 --> 02:56.723
Whoever sets up mom and pulls
her out of this slump, wins.

02:56.758 --> 02:59.526
Bonnie: Hey,
do either of you want my razors?

02:59.561 --> 03:01.461
I'm not gonna need 'em anymore!

03:03.598 --> 03:06.366
I'm not wrong, am I?
I mean, it's totally not fair.

03:06.401 --> 03:08.569
Ben didn't even give me
a say in this breakup,

03:08.603 --> 03:10.897
time out, holding pattern
or whatever it's called.

03:10.922 --> 03:11.471
(Dings)

03:11.506 --> 03:13.173
And you want to know what the worst part is?

03:13.207 --> 03:15.876
That I'm about to be stuck
in a small space with you?

03:17.011 --> 03:18.045
Sondra: Hold the elevator!

03:18.079 --> 03:20.013
- (Clicking rapidly)
- Oh dear God, please close.

03:20.048 --> 03:22.749
- Tucker.
- Sondra.

03:22.784 --> 03:24.685
Oh, hey, Riley. Back from yoga?

03:24.719 --> 03:26.687
- Yeah, we went to...
- I love yoga.

03:26.721 --> 03:27.821
It really takes my mind off things.

03:27.855 --> 03:30.691
Oh my God,
do I have a lot of things on my mind. A lot.

03:30.725 --> 03:33.627
- Oh my God, tell me about it.
- Okay, she's not really asking.

03:33.661 --> 03:34.761
It's just a figure of speech.

03:34.796 --> 03:36.597
Well, I'm sure it's about a guy.

03:36.631 --> 03:39.299
- You know, it's always about a guy.
- (Elevator stops)

03:39.334 --> 03:41.435
It is about a guy! My husband!

03:41.469 --> 03:44.204
Oh, does he want a break? Or a time out?

03:44.238 --> 03:48.108
Or did he tell you that you feel
something about someone that you don't?

03:48.142 --> 03:50.978
Because he will. They all do.
They're all crazy.

03:51.012 --> 03:52.079
You're all crazy.

03:53.081 --> 03:54.047
(Elevator starts)

03:54.082 --> 03:55.882
He's just been so aloof lately,

03:55.917 --> 03:58.819
always staying late at work,
never has time for my calls.

03:58.853 --> 04:00.721
Oh, girl, that's easy... he cheating.

04:00.755 --> 04:02.589
What? You really think so?

04:02.624 --> 04:04.358
It doesn't matter what he's doing!

04:04.392 --> 04:06.226
All that matters is what you're doing.

04:06.260 --> 04:07.527
You need to take charge of this situation

04:07.562 --> 04:09.262
so you don't have any regrets.

04:09.297 --> 04:10.430
- Go find your voice.
- (Elevator dings)

04:10.465 --> 04:12.532
My voice?
Oh my God, thank you so much, Riley.

04:12.567 --> 04:15.168
That was really good advice.
What people say about lawyers isn't true,

04:15.203 --> 04:17.070
because you're clearly very smart,
you're an attorney,

04:17.105 --> 04:18.305
and you totally know what
you're talking about.

04:20.308 --> 04:22.776
Riley,
what did I tell you about the elevator?

04:22.810 --> 04:24.845
Don't talk to anybody. I'm sorry.

04:27.915 --> 04:29.950
"Congratulations, Ben."
"Oh, thank you, Danny."

04:29.984 --> 04:31.818
That's a little glimpse into the future,

04:31.853 --> 04:33.553
because I just beat you.

04:33.588 --> 04:35.422
You see that guy right there?

04:35.456 --> 04:37.557
That's Richard, and he's perfect for mom.

04:41.496 --> 04:44.097
I think she ought to get
in line behind that guy.

04:44.132 --> 04:47.034
This isn't over. Oh crap, it's my boss!

04:47.068 --> 04:48.335
God, I hate him. He's so phony.

04:48.369 --> 04:50.103
Mr. Henderson! What's up, man?

04:50.138 --> 04:51.271
Good to see you. How are ya?

04:51.305 --> 04:53.106
Doing great,

04:53.141 --> 04:55.776
especially now that I'm finally
done with my messy divorce.

04:55.810 --> 04:57.978
And for the record, when people say "messy,"

04:58.012 --> 04:59.846
they mean, "she got everything."

05:01.616 --> 05:03.817
So, you just got divorced.

05:03.851 --> 05:07.454
Bummer. Any chance you're in the
market for some female companionship?

05:07.488 --> 05:10.590
Ooh. I don't allow hookers in my bar.

05:12.260 --> 05:13.660
But if you'd like to step outside,

05:13.695 --> 05:16.396
- maybe we can discuss this.
- 'I'm trying to set you up with my mom.

05:16.431 --> 05:19.199
Ah. Well,
I'm flatered that you would trust me

05:19.233 --> 05:20.967
with your mother's affections,

05:21.002 --> 05:23.036
especially after I just
showed interest in a hooker.

05:24.906 --> 05:28.675
Wheeler,
looks like I might get set up with your mom.

05:29.944 --> 05:32.546
If all goes well,
you could mix drinks for me here and at home.

05:32.580 --> 05:33.580
(Clicks tongue)

05:37.518 --> 05:38.652
What did you do?

05:38.686 --> 05:41.621
Just set the
multi-gajillionaire up with mom.

05:41.656 --> 05:44.191
(Laughs) Once again, I win.

05:44.225 --> 05:46.193
Danny, you can't just pick
some random good-looking guy

05:46.227 --> 05:48.128
with lots of money to go
out with mom to win the bet!

05:48.162 --> 05:49.262
You have to be selective,

05:49.297 --> 05:51.965
careful,
vet each prospective match thoroughly.

05:51.999 --> 05:54.134
Can I get a gin and tonic?

05:54.168 --> 05:55.969
How about a 40-something blonde?

05:57.739 --> 05:58.672
It's today's special.

06:00.942 --> 06:02.776
And here's another thing... fortune cookies.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.611
Fortune cookies are so stupid.

06:04.645 --> 06:06.379
Where are the realistic ones? Like...

06:06.414 --> 06:07.781
- "You'll finally date the guy of your dreams..."
- (Sighs)

06:07.815 --> 06:09.750
"...and then he'll dump you
for no reason whatsoever."

06:11.385 --> 06:13.453
"In bed." (Laughs)

06:14.689 --> 06:17.257
- (Knocks on door)
- No, see? It doesn't always work. No.

06:19.393 --> 06:22.229
You were right! He's a cheater! A cheater!

06:22.263 --> 06:24.397
I took your advice and look what I found!
A locket! A locket!

06:26.067 --> 06:28.201
A locket?
(Scoffs) I don't know which one's worse:

06:28.236 --> 06:29.836
The fact that he's cheating on you,

06:29.871 --> 06:31.104
or that it's with a 90-year-old.

06:33.007 --> 06:35.609
Look, it has a picture of him on one side

06:35.643 --> 06:36.643
and another woman on the other.

06:36.677 --> 06:37.978
Oh damn. I'd get her a locket.

06:39.981 --> 06:41.815
You know what? Nicely done.

06:41.849 --> 06:45.418
You listened to my advice,
and you took charge of your destiny.

06:45.453 --> 06:48.488
- But now what do I do?
- Well, since you've taken back control,

06:48.523 --> 06:50.157
and you have your proof,

06:50.191 --> 06:53.260
you have some tough decisions
to make about your marriage

06:53.294 --> 06:55.328
and as a highly-regarded legal professional,

06:55.363 --> 06:57.097
I'm here to tell... oh my God!

06:57.131 --> 06:58.999
Oh my God,
I'm supposed to be at a deposition!

06:59.033 --> 07:01.234
Okay, you know what?
I'm sure you're gonna work it out.

07:01.269 --> 07:02.803
- Have fun!
- Wait! Where are you going?

07:02.837 --> 07:04.771
- You can't leave me here with this crazy...
- (Door shuts)

07:05.907 --> 07:07.674
Amount of food.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.945
How can he do this to me?

07:11.979 --> 07:14.815
Do... do you wanna look in the locket again,
or...?

07:16.751 --> 07:19.753
I know I'm not the easiest
woman to live with.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.588
Or next to.

07:24.458 --> 07:26.092
Look...

07:26.127 --> 07:29.062
Sondra, I am really sorry

07:29.096 --> 07:30.363
that this is happening to you,

07:30.398 --> 07:32.365
and I know we are not the best of friends

07:32.400 --> 07:35.869
or... even friends at all for that matter.

07:36.904 --> 07:39.673
You know,
nobody deserves to be treated like this.

07:39.707 --> 07:41.641
Thank you, Tucker.

07:41.676 --> 07:43.577
You're very sweet.

07:43.611 --> 07:45.645
I can be. (Chuckles)

07:47.000 --> 07:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:58.797 --> 08:01.098
- Hey.
- Oh wow, mom, you look great.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.967
Try not to act so surprised.

08:03.001 --> 08:04.668
I was on the couch for two days,

08:04.703 --> 08:06.470
not in the woods for two years.

08:07.873 --> 08:09.807
All right, now where is this client
you said couldn't wait to meet me?

08:09.841 --> 08:12.309
Oh, they decided they could wait,

08:12.344 --> 08:14.311
but hey, let's grab lunch anyway, okay?

08:14.346 --> 08:16.347
- Okay.
- Okay, there she is.

08:16.381 --> 08:20.117
Wow! You're right.
Those legs really don't quit,

08:20.151 --> 08:22.419
though I would like to find
out where they take a break.

08:24.055 --> 08:26.190
Let's take it down a notch, sparky, okay?
That's my mom.

08:27.192 --> 08:29.927
In fact,
come wait out here while I go warm her up.

08:29.961 --> 08:32.196
Add that to the list of things you should
never have to say about your mother.

08:32.230 --> 08:34.698
Hey, Mr. Henderson, over here!

08:35.700 --> 08:38.602
- Have you met my mother, Bonnie?
- No,

08:38.636 --> 08:41.505
but I'd rather meet this
attractive young woman instead.

08:41.539 --> 08:44.742
Wow. I wish the nachos here
came with that much cheese.

08:44.776 --> 08:46.710
(Laughs)

08:46.745 --> 08:49.513
Jack Henderson, I have two hotels.

08:49.548 --> 08:52.550
Bonnie Wheeler,
and I have two of a lot of things.

08:53.552 --> 08:54.985
And a clueless son.

08:55.020 --> 08:57.121
- (Whispers) Danny, get lost.
- Oh yeah, I'll get you guys some drinks.

08:57.155 --> 08:58.255
(Chuckles)

08:58.290 --> 08:59.323
Sorry, little bro.

09:00.959 --> 09:03.193
Ironically, I just swore off men.

09:03.228 --> 09:05.829
But I think I'm about
to regret that decision.

09:05.864 --> 09:08.933
Excuse me, Mr. Henderson,
there's a call for you in the office.

09:08.967 --> 09:10.134
(Sighs) I'll be right back.

09:10.168 --> 09:11.702
Don't move a muscle.

09:11.736 --> 09:14.638
Well,
the only muscle I'll be moving is this one.

09:15.707 --> 09:17.608
(Mutters)

09:18.944 --> 09:21.412
Oh, this is for you

09:21.446 --> 09:23.447
from the gentleman outside.

09:23.481 --> 09:25.616
Well, why would he send me a drink

09:25.650 --> 09:27.551
when I'm obviously sitting...

09:27.586 --> 09:30.354
(Gasps) In the wrong section.

09:30.388 --> 09:33.190
(Laughs) The young guns are out there.

09:34.192 --> 09:36.193
Well, you know,
Jack did say he'd be a minute.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.963
Oops, time's up.
I can't be expected to wait around forever.

09:41.933 --> 09:43.300
Hi, I'm Bonnie.

09:43.335 --> 09:46.837
- And I'm Frank.
- Well, you two seem to be hitting it off.

09:46.871 --> 09:48.973
Mr. Henderson needs me in his
office right away? Thank you.

09:51.076 --> 09:52.876
Wait. What... what are you doing out here?

09:52.911 --> 09:55.746
- And when is he leaving?
- Honey, this is Frank.

09:55.780 --> 09:56.914
(Whispers) Be cool!

09:56.948 --> 09:59.617
Hi, Frank. I'm Danny.

09:59.651 --> 10:01.619
- Nice to meet you. Oh.
- (Gasps)

10:01.653 --> 10:03.554
- What's the matter with you?
- Danny!

10:03.588 --> 10:06.323
I'm sorry.
I forgot that I had a drink in that hand,

10:06.358 --> 10:08.459
- it happens.
- Yeah.

10:08.493 --> 10:11.261
I gotta go. Maybe some other time.

10:11.296 --> 10:14.231
Oh, Frank. Oh.

10:14.265 --> 10:18.235
Well, lucky for you,
today I'm traveling with a spare.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.870
Now where's Jack?

10:19.904 --> 10:21.338
Oh, hey, mom, bad news.

10:21.373 --> 10:24.008
He's holed up in his office.
I'm not sure what happened.

10:24.042 --> 10:26.110
Something about losing something.

10:27.779 --> 10:29.847
Well,
the last time I lost two guys this fast,

10:29.881 --> 10:31.682
was when I told the three guys I was dating

10:31.716 --> 10:33.817
in high school I was pregnant. (Laughs)

10:35.453 --> 10:36.820
You may have gotten rid of Frank,
but it doesn't matter.

10:36.855 --> 10:39.723
I'm still gonna win.
Do you just wanna concede now?

10:39.758 --> 10:42.593
If concede means I win, then I do.

10:42.627 --> 10:45.429
- It doesn't.
- Then I don't.

10:50.235 --> 10:53.170
Tucker, hi. Oh my gosh, I am so sorry

10:53.204 --> 10:54.938
about sondra. Was she upset?

10:55.940 --> 10:57.074
Not when she left.

10:58.943 --> 11:01.211
You and you have ruined my life!

11:01.246 --> 11:02.980
Ru-ined! I couldn't take it,

11:03.014 --> 11:05.649
so I demanded an explanation,
and threw the locket in my husband's face,

11:05.684 --> 11:08.519
- and do you know what he said?
- "Ow"?

11:09.688 --> 11:11.755
He said the locket was for me,

11:11.790 --> 11:13.590
and that woman's picture came with it!

11:13.625 --> 11:15.426
So now he's not the cheater! I am!

11:15.460 --> 11:18.562
- A cheater? With who?
- With him!

11:21.433 --> 11:23.500
I'm sorry,
but Tucker's the only person standing there.

11:25.070 --> 11:27.171
He preyed on me while I was weak.

11:27.205 --> 11:29.339
You weren't too weak to
carry me into that bedroom!

11:29.374 --> 11:33.143
Tucker! Now what is the matter with you?

11:33.178 --> 11:35.212
(Laughs) Don't be pointing fingers!

11:35.246 --> 11:39.883
If it weren't for all your don't-let-men
decide-your-future girl-power extremism,

11:39.918 --> 11:42.519
I never would've ended up in
his bed in the first place!

11:42.554 --> 11:43.721
Yeah, Riley.

11:44.889 --> 11:46.824
If you didn't shove all
your girl power on her,

11:46.858 --> 11:48.759
she wouldn't have shoved
her girl parts on me.

11:50.495 --> 11:52.296
Now if you will excuse me,

11:52.330 --> 11:53.530
I'm going to figure out a way,

11:53.565 --> 11:56.333
to tell my husband and
pray that he forgives me.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.169
I'm an adulteress! An adulteress!

12:00.205 --> 12:01.505
- (Door slams)
- Wow.

12:04.042 --> 12:05.409
You really ruined her life.

12:06.978 --> 12:08.979
I'm just... I'm glad I stayed out of it.

12:11.816 --> 12:15.052
(Knocks) Knock-knock. Mom, you decent?

12:15.086 --> 12:17.721
So, mom's not here,

12:17.756 --> 12:19.690
but she couldn't have gone far.

12:19.724 --> 12:21.592
Can I get you something to eat?

12:21.626 --> 12:24.628
Ooh. Still warm. It's probably okay.

12:24.662 --> 12:26.530
All right, so you wait here

12:26.564 --> 12:27.765
and I'm gonna go find her.

12:27.799 --> 12:29.700
She's probably out getting cleaning supplies

12:29.734 --> 12:30.768
or buying hangers.

12:30.802 --> 12:34.304
Don't you think she might
be just a tad concerned

12:34.339 --> 12:36.473
to come home and find a
strange man in her apartment?

12:36.508 --> 12:38.342
You'd be surprised.

12:39.444 --> 12:41.345
- Mind if I wash up?
- Oh yeah, sure.

12:41.379 --> 12:43.347
The mop's next to the fridge. Thanks.

12:46.050 --> 12:47.751
- (Door opens)
- Bonnie: And that concludes

12:47.786 --> 12:49.787
today's post-daycare wrap-up,

12:49.821 --> 12:51.922
"why grandma's gonna die alone."

12:51.956 --> 12:55.759
No, she's not, Emma.
I'm gonna be right there with her,

12:55.794 --> 12:58.796
because today I ruined somebody's
life and their marriage.

13:00.565 --> 13:02.633
Well... I scrubbed so hard

13:02.667 --> 13:04.501
I think I'm actually a shade lighter.

13:06.504 --> 13:07.604
What's up with him?

13:07.639 --> 13:10.174
- He slept with sondra.
- Riley!

13:10.208 --> 13:12.209
(Gasps) You slept with Sondra?

13:12.243 --> 13:13.410
Are you deaf?

13:18.183 --> 13:20.050
- (Emma laughs)
- I know.

13:20.084 --> 13:21.885
- You've met her.
- (Door shuts)

13:23.922 --> 13:25.189
Hey, mom, it's your favorite son!

13:26.157 --> 13:27.958
Hey, man,
thanks for giving my mom a second chance.

13:27.992 --> 13:29.827
You two are gonna have
a lot of fun together.

13:29.861 --> 13:32.529
You and your mom seem oddly close.

13:32.564 --> 13:34.565
That's why you're here, Frank.
Take off some of the pressure.

13:34.599 --> 13:36.700
- Right.
- All right, looks like she stepped out,

13:36.734 --> 13:38.769
so I'll go see if I can track her down.
Make yourself comfortable.

13:38.803 --> 13:41.338
Don't you think she'll
be a little freaked out

13:41.372 --> 13:43.240
to find a strange man in her apartment?

13:43.274 --> 13:44.408
You'd be surprised.

13:48.513 --> 13:51.315
Hey, Tucker, I got you these,

13:51.349 --> 13:54.351
you know,
in case you wanna hook up with Sondra again.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.956
Oh my God, Mrs. Wheeler,
I think you're being robbed.

13:58.990 --> 14:00.157
What?

14:00.191 --> 14:02.693
Frank?

14:02.727 --> 14:04.695
How the hell did he get in my apartment?

14:04.729 --> 14:06.697
Oh! I'm gonna kill Ben...

14:06.731 --> 14:09.566
Or thank him, depending on where this goes.

14:09.601 --> 14:13.537
How can I swear off men when they
are literally breaking down my door?

14:15.773 --> 14:18.275
Wait, why does that guy look so familiar?

14:19.277 --> 14:21.378
(Gasps) Because that's no guy.

14:21.412 --> 14:22.579
That's Sondra's husband.

14:23.581 --> 14:26.516
Yes! Ha! So he really is a cheater.

14:27.785 --> 14:30.387
I'm not really sure that this
is a high-five kind of moment.

14:33.779 --> 14:34.812
(Dings)

14:36.615 --> 14:38.483
What's up, Danny? What are you doing here?

14:38.517 --> 14:41.352
Uh... nothing.

14:41.387 --> 14:43.488
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

14:45.090 --> 14:47.158
- (Both grunt)
- I don't think so, man.

14:48.193 --> 14:50.261
Both: Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

14:50.295 --> 14:52.096
Danny: I gotta talk to you, mom!

14:54.199 --> 14:55.967
Hey, what's up, guys?
We're just looking for my mom.

14:57.202 --> 14:59.036
Yeah, she just left for her place.

14:59.071 --> 15:00.938
So should we go tell Sondra the bad news?

15:00.973 --> 15:03.641
- Try not to gloat.
- Try not to have sex with her.

15:05.677 --> 15:07.712
You lost. Mom's gonna walk right in

15:07.746 --> 15:09.046
to Mr. Henderson sitting on her couch.

15:09.081 --> 15:10.948
What are you talking about?
Frank's at her apartment right now.

15:10.983 --> 15:12.550
No, Mr. Henderson is.

15:13.619 --> 15:15.753
- (Ben gasps)
- Both: Uh-oh.

15:17.322 --> 15:18.689
- No! No! I...
- Yes!

15:18.724 --> 15:20.658
(Both grunting)

15:21.693 --> 15:23.194
No!

15:25.164 --> 15:27.231
Hello! I've got a hot delivery for...

15:28.233 --> 15:29.367
Frank?

15:29.401 --> 15:32.937
- Hello?
- Mom! We can explain!

15:32.971 --> 15:34.972
Hopefully what that guy
from the bar was doing

15:35.007 --> 15:36.808
standing in my apartment 10 minutes ago.

15:36.842 --> 15:39.043
- Wait. Are you alone?
- Uh-huh.

15:45.617 --> 15:47.585
I don't know what's going on.

15:47.619 --> 15:50.655
That's what I get for leaving
the safety of my sweatpants.

15:50.689 --> 15:52.423
(Hisses)

15:55.260 --> 15:57.361
(Sighs) There you are.

15:57.396 --> 15:59.230
I've been running around
for the last two hours.

15:59.264 --> 16:01.065
And I've been drinking
for the last two hours,

16:01.099 --> 16:02.333
trying to figure out why a son would

16:02.367 --> 16:04.202
set his mom up for a three-way.

16:05.237 --> 16:08.039
No! Oh God, no, no no.

16:08.073 --> 16:10.141
You've got it all wrong. That's her ex.

16:10.175 --> 16:13.010
Horrible breakup.
She wants to start over with you.

16:13.045 --> 16:15.046
Not really looking to settle down.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.748
Either is she! She hates commitment.

16:17.783 --> 16:20.685
She loves a good fling.
In fact, you should go fling her right now.

16:23.789 --> 16:26.624
- Oh God!
- And it looks like I win again.

16:26.658 --> 16:28.726
I just dropped Henderson
off at mom's 10 minutes ago.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.262
(Laughs) Oh yeah.

16:32.264 --> 16:34.499
- Are you Ben Wheeler?
- Who's asking?

16:34.533 --> 16:38.135
- The F.B.I.
- Then I'm answering and sweating.

16:38.170 --> 16:39.170
How can I help you?

16:40.172 --> 16:41.839
We're looking for Jack Henderson.

16:41.874 --> 16:43.941
We have a warrant for his
arrest for tax evasion.

16:43.976 --> 16:45.176
Do you know where we can find him?

16:45.210 --> 16:46.777
Really?

16:48.046 --> 16:49.780
Oh my God, I win!

16:49.815 --> 16:52.550
Yes! I finally win!

16:53.752 --> 16:54.785
Sorry, it's a long story.

16:54.820 --> 16:56.521
Come with me. I'll show you where he is.

16:57.623 --> 16:58.823
Yes! Oh!

17:01.460 --> 17:03.494
So, just ballpark figures.

17:03.529 --> 17:06.564
- Can you afford a ballpark?
- (Laughs)

17:06.598 --> 17:08.465
- Oh yeah.
- (Laughs)

17:08.500 --> 17:11.202
But I'd rather talk about other figures.

17:11.236 --> 17:13.938
- Yours.
- Oh.

17:13.972 --> 17:15.172
Aha! See?

17:15.207 --> 17:17.942
♪ Cheater, cheater,
pumpkin... ♪ that's not your husband.

17:17.976 --> 17:20.877
- He most certainly is not.
- Wait, are you sure? Look again.

17:22.047 --> 17:24.048
What is wrong with the two of you?

17:24.082 --> 17:25.148
Bonnie, hi, I'm sorry...

17:25.183 --> 17:26.951
- Frank?
- Sondra!

17:28.020 --> 17:29.754
Hey, there you are.

17:29.788 --> 17:30.955
These are for you.

17:30.989 --> 17:32.657
Don't read the card.

17:33.759 --> 17:36.394
You're married? To Sondra?

17:37.396 --> 17:38.563
Are you deaf?

17:41.333 --> 17:43.568
Thank God I listened to Riley,

17:43.602 --> 17:46.070
who inspired me to take charge of my life

17:46.104 --> 17:48.306
and not have any regrets.
She helped me find my voice.

17:48.340 --> 17:50.141
And this voice is taking it to the rooftops

17:50.175 --> 17:52.143
and yelling "it's over!" O-ver!

17:53.278 --> 17:55.246
Honey, please!

17:56.882 --> 17:59.116
- Now is this a high-five moment?
- Yeah, it is!

18:00.352 --> 18:02.720
Hey, hey, why was Frank just
running out of here with Sondra?

18:02.754 --> 18:04.589
Because she's his wife.

18:04.623 --> 18:05.690
Really?

18:05.724 --> 18:06.891
Is he deaf?

18:08.727 --> 18:11.596
- F.B.I., you're under arrest.
- Damn it. Damn it.

18:13.465 --> 18:15.499
Okay, let me just say it was spring break,

18:15.534 --> 18:18.402
I was 17,
and so I wasn't officially an adult yet.

18:18.437 --> 18:22.206
- Just...
- Mom, not you. Mr. Henderson.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.308
What? Whoa! There's gotta be some mistake.

18:24.343 --> 18:26.010
Hey, hey. Hey, let's talk about this.

18:26.044 --> 18:28.045
You look like lobster guys.
Do you like lobster?

18:28.080 --> 18:29.981
I love lobster. I've got a great...

18:30.015 --> 18:31.159
Hey, what's going on?

18:31.184 --> 18:33.884
Your guy is going to
prison for tax evasion.

18:33.919 --> 18:35.853
That's what's going on, so you lose.

18:35.887 --> 18:37.088
Oh, and you think setting mom up

18:37.122 --> 18:39.023
with a married man constitutes a win?

18:39.057 --> 18:39.739
I don't think so.

18:39.764 --> 18:41.826
Okay, what the hell are
you two talking about?

18:41.860 --> 18:43.761
Lose what? Win what?

18:43.795 --> 18:46.697
What was this? Some kind of contest? A game?

18:46.732 --> 18:48.866
"Find a date for poor old mom"?

18:48.900 --> 18:51.702
Well, when you say it like that,
it sounds like we did a bad thing.

18:53.605 --> 18:55.439
Okay, so you didn't even care enough

18:55.474 --> 18:58.242
to find out anything about these guys,

18:58.276 --> 19:00.544
like whether they're married or a felon?

19:02.247 --> 19:05.216
I mean, so you think I would
just go out with just anybody?

19:06.351 --> 19:08.285
I feel like the real
answer might make you mad.

19:10.022 --> 19:12.056
Well, why would you think that?

19:12.090 --> 19:15.159
You don't see me going out
with a bunch of random guys

19:15.193 --> 19:17.862
that I don't even bother getting to know,
do you?

19:21.633 --> 19:22.933
Oh my God.

19:24.703 --> 19:25.803
You're right.

19:27.506 --> 19:28.873
That's exactly what I do.

19:30.709 --> 19:32.476
Why do I do that?

19:33.912 --> 19:35.513
You know what?

19:36.715 --> 19:40.484
From now on I'm gonna
remember how amazing I am

19:41.820 --> 19:44.588
ad I'm gonna make sure that the
guys I date are just as amazing.

19:45.657 --> 19:47.725
So what you're saying is "thank you"?

19:47.759 --> 19:50.795
No! No, "thank you's" are reserved

19:50.829 --> 19:53.564
for people who actually
meant to do the right thing,

19:53.598 --> 19:55.533
not for selfish kids who got lucky.

19:57.502 --> 19:58.736
Come here.

20:00.639 --> 20:02.606
(Both grunt)

20:04.743 --> 20:07.578
Who needs a man in her
life when I've got you two?

20:08.880 --> 20:11.549
Mom? It's a little tight to be a hug, mom!

20:11.583 --> 20:12.783
Yeah, I'm still mad. I'm still a little mad.

20:12.818 --> 20:14.785
Mom! Ow!

20:18.723 --> 20:20.824
So we agree? No more competing.

20:20.859 --> 20:22.159
- (Knocks on door)
- Yeah, man. You're right.

20:22.193 --> 20:24.028
It's just so immature.

20:24.062 --> 20:25.963
Yes! I win! What?

20:25.997 --> 20:28.699
Ooh! Oh man.

20:28.733 --> 20:29.900
Rematch?

20:29.935 --> 20:31.001
You're on, buddy.

20:32.103 --> 20:34.705
Tucker, you need to talk to the mailman

20:34.739 --> 20:37.708
about keeping your mail out of my box.

20:44.683 --> 20:45.749
Don't wait up.
