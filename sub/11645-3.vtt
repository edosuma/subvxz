00:00.195 --> 00:01.754
What the fuck is going on?

00:02.383 --> 00:04.462
Since when did you
jump off buildings?

00:04.840 --> 00:06.879
Since I travelled
back from the future.

00:06.880 --> 00:08.359
'So what happens now?'

00:08.360 --> 00:10.039
'You fall in love with me.'

00:11.400 --> 00:14.959
You can't die, I love you.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.759
I'll still be here.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.839
Where did you get that?

00:18.840 --> 00:19.679
The guy in the mask.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.719
Who is he?

00:20.720 --> 00:22.839
It's you.

00:22.840 --> 00:26.839
All that matters is us, here, now.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.079
Give me your phone.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.559
Come on, come on. I ain't got
all fucking day!

01:04.560 --> 01:07.879
Come on! Give it over!

01:07.880 --> 01:11.879
I'll fucking hurt you, man.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.799
Who the fuck are you?

01:19.800 --> 01:21.399
Let him go.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.879
Stay there.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.799
What's with the mask?

01:25.800 --> 01:28.919
Look at this shit.

01:28.920 --> 01:32.919
You look like a dick.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.039
Now then...

01:37.040 --> 01:41.039
Let's have a look at you.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.359
You're a superhero.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.439
Look, I know you can't tell me
who you are.

01:59.440 --> 02:03.439
That's why you have a secret
identity, right?

02:04.240 --> 02:05.839
It's a bit cheesy, but...

02:05.840 --> 02:09.839
can I get a photograph
of us together?

02:13.960 --> 02:17.959
Shit. It's broken.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.679
Simon?

02:40.680 --> 02:43.319
Simon!

02:43.320 --> 02:44.679
What happened?

02:44.680 --> 02:48.679
Someone stamped on my hand.

02:48.704 --> 02:51.204
<font color="#3333FF">Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd, MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3333FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:30.720 --> 03:32.279
I did it.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.799
I actually saved someone.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.719
I didn't think I could do it.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.679
But you could've been
seriously hurt.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.679
If I don't take risks,
I'll never learn.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.799
I'll never become him.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.399
Why are you so obsessed
with becoming him?

03:48.400 --> 03:50.399
I have to save you.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.279
You don't have to do anything.
You already saved me.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.239
I'll always save you.

03:55.240 --> 03:58.359
It's like you're excited about it.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.039
If you become him,
you're going to leave me.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.799
You're going to travel back in time
and you're going to die.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.799
And if I don't become him and travel
back in time, you're going to die.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.239
I can't die in the past
if I'm alive in the present.

04:12.240 --> 04:15.599
I don't know anything about this
Terminator time travel bullshit,

04:15.600 --> 04:19.599
but even I know that.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.159
You're going to stay here with me.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.559
Because you can dress it up
anyway you like,

04:26.560 --> 04:28.999
but if you travel back in time,
you're dumping me.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.159
And I don't get dumped.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.799
So it's not going to happen.
OK?

04:32.800 --> 04:36.159
I didn't mean to upset you.

04:36.160 --> 04:40.159
I'm sorry.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.999
How does it feel?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.519
It hurts.

04:44.520 --> 04:48.519
Good.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.239
What's going on?

04:57.240 --> 05:00.079
Probation worker told us
to put them out. Some bollocks.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.559
I think we're playing
musical chairs, man.

05:01.560 --> 05:02.999
Yeah, seems likely.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.239
Probation worker's
big on party games.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.999
Maybe he's changed.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.519
Right, you sacks of shit.
Here they are.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.599
Who are they?

05:10.600 --> 05:12.439
Another bunch of fuck-ups.

05:12.440 --> 05:16.439
Right, everyone grab a seat.

05:16.520 --> 05:20.519
The sooner we start,
the sooner we can all fuck off.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.239
What is this?

05:23.240 --> 05:26.279
Er, it's called
"Preventative Intervention".

05:26.280 --> 05:27.679
Sounds kinky, dunnit?

05:27.680 --> 05:29.719
Oh! Jesus!

05:29.720 --> 05:32.799
OK. They're going to tell you
how they fucked up

05:32.800 --> 05:35.119
and you tell them
how not to fuck up again

05:35.120 --> 05:37.199
so they don't end up as big
a fuck-ups as you.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.759
You think you can manage that?

05:38.760 --> 05:40.719
Who's he calling a fuck-up there?

05:40.720 --> 05:44.559
Right, who's first?

05:44.560 --> 05:48.519
You. You're up.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.199
Well go on.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.559
My name's...

05:52.560 --> 05:54.159
No-one cares.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.479
Just get on with it.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.719
There's this girl I like.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.599
She was in a club.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.599
I pretended to steal her handbag.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.759
Why would you pretend
to steal her bag?

06:06.760 --> 06:08.399
So I could give it back to her.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.959
Cos girls love it
when you steal their bags, yeah?!

06:11.960 --> 06:15.959
Do you want me to read it from
the file? Cos it's all in here.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.799
I thought, if I stole it,

06:19.800 --> 06:22.839
and I said that
I caught the guy who took it...

06:32.960 --> 06:36.599
Sorry, mate. Go on. I thought you'd
finished. I thought he'd finished.

06:36.600 --> 06:40.599
You were saying something about
a chicken. Or summat?

06:40.760 --> 06:44.119
Why would I be
daydreaming about a chicken?

06:44.120 --> 06:45.599
Go on.

06:45.600 --> 06:49.599
I'm dying to hear how this
thrilling story ends!

06:51.800 --> 06:54.159
I thought if I got her
her bag back...

06:54.160 --> 06:56.319
I thought...

06:56.320 --> 06:58.999
I thought I'd be a hero.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.599
Jesus Christ.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.199
All right, yes. Whatever.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.639
Any pearls of wisdom
for him, help him out?

07:05.640 --> 07:09.239
Don't go round stealing
other people's handbags.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.079
Brilliant.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.879
Right, you're done.

07:14.880 --> 07:18.879
OK, tubs. You're next.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.679
It won't be like this forever.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.479
You'll meet a girl who likes you.

07:35.480 --> 07:39.479
You won't have to steal her bag.

07:43.480 --> 07:44.999
You're the guy in the mask.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.839
I don't know what you're
talking about.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.839
It's you. I recognise your voice.
The cut on your hand.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.959
You can't tell anyone.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.399
No-one can know.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.439
I won't. I won't tell anyone.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.439
How did you become a superhero?

08:01.440 --> 08:03.439
I want to know everything.

08:03.440 --> 08:07.119
We should go for a beer.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.879
That isn't a good idea.

08:09.880 --> 08:13.879
I think it's best you just
forget you ever met me.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.879
Woah, hey! Ho ho ho!

08:18.880 --> 08:22.879
Brilliant.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.679
Glad you and your boyfriend
have finished.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.799
I hope you've washed your hands,
and your genitals.

08:34.799 --> 08:35.759
I'm not gay.

08:35.760 --> 08:39.719
So you were showing each
other your cocks because..?

08:39.720 --> 08:42.759
We were just... looking...

08:42.760 --> 08:43.999
At each other's cocks.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.759
It's a perfect...

08:46.760 --> 08:49.599
Oh... It's a perfectly natural,

08:49.600 --> 08:52.719
everyday part of being a gay man.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.999
It's like window shopping.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.999
Window shopping.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.679
We didn't have sex. I'm not gay.

09:01.680 --> 09:04.839
I didn't say anything.

09:04.840 --> 09:05.879
What's this?

09:05.880 --> 09:09.879
I don't know. What is that?
What is it?

09:10.080 --> 09:12.879
It's fucking.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.559
Is it?

09:56.640 --> 09:59.239
Hi.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.559
Hi.

10:00.560 --> 10:04.559
I bought my first Superman comic
when I was five.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.479
And after that, I was hooked.

10:07.480 --> 10:11.079
My life was so boring and normal.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.799
Suddenly, there were all these
incredible people,

10:13.800 --> 10:17.199
with these amazing powers,
doing incredible things.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.199
I used to spend hours making up
stories, doing the artwork.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.319
I've always been obsessed with
superheroes.

10:25.320 --> 10:29.319
Now I've actually met one.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.879
I'm not sure I'm really a superhero.

10:32.880 --> 10:36.079
You wear a costume
and you jump off buildings

10:36.080 --> 10:38.319
and you save people from muggers.
Trust me,

10:38.320 --> 10:42.239
that makes you a superhero.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.359
Most people would think
I was a freak.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.959
Those people are idiots.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.959
They don't understand what it means,
to be prepared to risk your life.

10:51.110 --> 10:55.109
To be prepared to die
for what you believe in.

10:58.470 --> 11:01.829
Would you like to be my best friend?

11:01.830 --> 11:02.716
Great.

11:32.967 --> 11:33.686
What's up with him?

11:33.687 --> 11:35.126
Hmm...

11:35.127 --> 11:38.246
He thinks he's got cancer.

11:38.247 --> 11:41.126
Wait, if he has cancer,
won't you have cancer?

11:41.127 --> 11:43.606
No. Because he doesn't have cancer.

11:43.607 --> 11:45.846
There's something new every week.

11:45.847 --> 11:47.766
He's like the boy who cried
"tumour".

11:47.767 --> 11:50.166
I have a lump. Feel it.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.366
I don't want to finger fuck
your armpit, I think I'll pass.

11:59.567 --> 12:03.566
Woah!

12:04.967 --> 12:07.926
Who the fuck is this?

12:07.927 --> 12:10.846
It's me auntie.
Who do you think he is?

12:10.847 --> 12:13.726
What, you've got a twin brother?

12:13.727 --> 12:16.246
Now it's getting past you,
is it, today?

12:16.247 --> 12:19.406
Check out the big brains
on the probation worker here.

12:19.407 --> 12:22.166
Why's he wearing a jumpsuit?

12:22.167 --> 12:23.886
Because...

12:23.887 --> 12:27.886
sometimes I do my community
service, sometimes he does it.

12:28.327 --> 12:31.806
We like to mix things up.
It keeps it interesting.

12:31.807 --> 12:34.086
This isn't a job share.

12:34.087 --> 12:38.086
Whoever does the crime,
does the boring, mindless shit.

12:38.447 --> 12:40.526
I have a question, right?

12:40.527 --> 12:44.446
What if we we're conjoined twins,
yeah, with our heads?

12:44.447 --> 12:46.286
They're all mashed together,

12:46.287 --> 12:49.446
and we go out in the town,
for a few beers,

12:49.447 --> 12:51.806
some bloke sees us
and he's like,

12:51.807 --> 12:54.606
"Oi! You two-headed fuck!"

12:54.607 --> 12:58.606
He flips out, goes mental
and batters the guy.

12:59.727 --> 13:01.966
Who does the community service then?

13:01.967 --> 13:05.366
Because they, they are conjoined
with one massive head

13:05.367 --> 13:09.366
but with two personalities.

13:12.607 --> 13:14.446
Well, we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

13:14.447 --> 13:16.086
All right.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.686
I'm going to pretend like
I never saw this,

13:18.687 --> 13:20.846
because I really can't be arsed.

13:20.847 --> 13:24.846
Just make sure one of you turns up.

13:26.167 --> 13:29.006
Oh man.

13:29.007 --> 13:30.206
That's insane.

13:30.207 --> 13:34.206
The old conjoined twins mind fuck
works every time. Dunnit?

13:48.007 --> 13:50.326
What're you doing?

13:50.327 --> 13:52.886
I'm just talking to Peter.

13:52.887 --> 13:54.006
Why?

13:54.007 --> 13:55.046
What d'you mean?

13:55.047 --> 13:57.126
Why were you talking to him?

13:57.127 --> 13:59.406
He's my friend.

13:59.407 --> 14:01.806
He's your friend?

14:01.807 --> 14:05.806
I do have friends... you know.

14:06.767 --> 14:09.046
Yeah, I know.
I didn't mean it like that.

14:09.047 --> 14:13.046
What are you doing later?
I'm going to hang out with Peter.

14:13.407 --> 14:17.406
OK. I was going to see
some friends anyway, so...

14:43.327 --> 14:45.886
You have a secret lair.

14:45.887 --> 14:49.006
This is totally superhero.

14:49.007 --> 14:51.326
How did you find this place?

14:51.327 --> 14:52.566
I didn't find it.

14:52.567 --> 14:55.406
It was my future self.

14:55.407 --> 14:58.126
He lived here.

14:58.127 --> 15:02.086
You have a future self?

15:02.087 --> 15:05.486
Tell me everything.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.046
He's chasing Alisha through
the warehouse.

15:08.047 --> 15:10.686
He catches her
and he's pointing a gun at her.

15:10.687 --> 15:12.966
I'm just waiting, up on the roof.

15:12.967 --> 15:14.926
I jump as he pulls the trigger.

15:14.927 --> 15:17.326
I die saving her.

15:17.327 --> 15:19.726
You die?

15:19.727 --> 15:21.846
Well if you know it's going
to happen,

15:21.847 --> 15:24.566
why don't you wear
a bullet proof vest?

15:24.567 --> 15:27.046
Because if the future me
doesn't die,

15:27.047 --> 15:30.326
she'll never fall in love with me
as I was then, in the present.

15:30.327 --> 15:32.766
And if she doesn't
fall in love with me,

15:32.767 --> 15:34.926
I'll never become my future self.

15:34.927 --> 15:36.486
And if I don't become him,

15:36.487 --> 15:38.406
I won't be able to save her

15:38.407 --> 15:41.326
and she'll never fall in love with me.

15:41.327 --> 15:45.046
It all has to happen,
exactly like it happened.

15:45.047 --> 15:49.046
It's my destiny.

15:50.367 --> 15:54.366
That is so fucking cool.

15:58.527 --> 16:00.006
What are you doing?

16:00.007 --> 16:04.006
Why is that out?

16:07.567 --> 16:11.566
I was just showing it to Peter.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.286
Have you told him?

16:13.287 --> 16:15.766
It was Peter I saved
from the mugger.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.486
He recognised me.

16:17.487 --> 16:20.006
What, so you just tell him
everything?

16:20.007 --> 16:22.126
It's OK.

16:22.127 --> 16:23.646
I won't tell anyone.

16:23.647 --> 16:26.086
This has got nothing to do with you.

16:26.087 --> 16:30.086
Can you just leave?

16:31.567 --> 16:35.406
Go!?

16:35.407 --> 16:39.406
I think you should probably go.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.206
Why are you telling him
all this stuff?

16:54.207 --> 16:55.646
He's my friend.

16:55.647 --> 16:59.126
He's not your friend.
You've only just met him.

16:59.127 --> 17:00.926
We've talked about this.

17:00.927 --> 17:04.925
I don't want to see that
fucking suit ever again...

17:18.807 --> 17:20.646
D'you want any toast?

17:20.646 --> 17:23.126
I have to face my destiny, alone.

17:23.127 --> 17:24.566
OK.

17:24.567 --> 17:28.566
Is that before or after
you have breakfast?

17:28.567 --> 17:32.406
Being a superhero is a heavy burden.

17:32.407 --> 17:35.046
So now you're calling
yourself a superhero?

17:35.047 --> 17:38.486
Right.

17:38.487 --> 17:41.046
I have to terminate
our relationship.

17:41.047 --> 17:42.366
What?

17:42.367 --> 17:44.246
Why are you talking like that?

17:44.247 --> 17:47.566
I have to sacrifice our love
for the greater good.

17:47.567 --> 17:51.326
What the fuck has got into you?
Where's all this coming from?

17:51.327 --> 17:54.726
Goodbye, Alisha.

17:54.727 --> 17:56.046
Where are you going?

17:56.047 --> 17:58.686
You can't just walk away, Simon.

17:58.687 --> 18:02.686
What the fuck are you doing?

18:02.847 --> 18:05.846
One day, you'll come to see that
I did it all for you.

18:05.847 --> 18:09.246
Simon! Wait!

18:09.247 --> 18:13.246
Simon!

18:29.727 --> 18:32.806
What did he say exactly?

18:32.807 --> 18:34.206
He was talking shit.

18:34.207 --> 18:37.886
He said we can't be together.
Everything was fine.

18:37.887 --> 18:40.086
It's like it's just come
out of nowhere.

18:40.087 --> 18:41.326
What's going on? You all right?

18:41.327 --> 18:43.566
Her and Simon have split up.

18:43.567 --> 18:46.006
What? I thought you two
were well loved up?

18:46.007 --> 18:46.846
Yes, so did I.

18:46.847 --> 18:49.486
Oh...

18:49.487 --> 18:50.486
Oh...

18:50.487 --> 18:51.926
What?

18:51.927 --> 18:53.606
I can't, I can't tell you.

18:53.607 --> 18:54.966
Tell me what?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.406
Mmm!

18:56.407 --> 18:59.406
The other day,
I walked in on Simon,

18:59.407 --> 19:03.406
shy, stealing handbag kid in the
toilets, I can't tell you. I can't.

19:03.407 --> 19:04.046
What is it?

19:04.047 --> 19:07.646
They were showing each
other their cocks.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.446
That's bullshit.

19:08.447 --> 19:12.166
No. I think I know what two
blokes in a public toilet look like,

19:12.167 --> 19:14.566
showing each other their knobs.

19:14.567 --> 19:18.526
All I'm saying is, maybe your
boyfriend is a proud beautiful
gay man,

19:18.527 --> 19:21.646
who likes to rub
and touch other men's penises.

19:21.647 --> 19:24.406
He's not gay!
He's the best shag I ever had.

19:24.407 --> 19:26.286
I'll just pretend I'm not here,
yeah?

19:26.287 --> 19:28.726
I've got a lot more control.
That was my first time.

19:28.727 --> 19:31.326
I'm in full control
of my ejaculate now.

19:31.327 --> 19:32.366
All blokes say that.

19:32.367 --> 19:35.886
Next thing you know, you've got come
all over your face and in your hair.

19:35.887 --> 19:37.726
That's a lovely image.

19:37.727 --> 19:39.006
He's not gay.

19:39.007 --> 19:41.126
I'm not saying you turned him,

19:41.127 --> 19:44.646
but maybe you did.

19:44.647 --> 19:46.246
You're deflecting.

19:46.247 --> 19:48.726
All right. Take it out
on your Uncle Rudy.

19:48.727 --> 19:50.846
Do it! Jesus!

19:50.847 --> 19:53.726
What the fuck is your problem!?

19:53.727 --> 19:55.006
She's deflecting.

19:55.007 --> 19:59.006
Jesus.

20:09.927 --> 20:13.926
Did he tell you he split up with me?

20:14.087 --> 20:16.126
I'm sure you're really
happy about that.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.566
You've got your little friend
all to yourself now.

20:18.567 --> 20:21.606
Being a superhero
and having a girlfriend...

20:21.607 --> 20:24.446
They don't mix.
They never have.

20:24.447 --> 20:27.886
Very few superheroes have
successful relationships.

20:27.887 --> 20:31.166
He's not a superhero.
He's my boyfriend.

20:31.167 --> 20:32.646
He WAS your boyfriend.

20:32.647 --> 20:36.646
Fuck you, you little prick!

20:36.647 --> 20:39.046
What's that?

20:39.047 --> 20:41.806
Are you obsessed with him
or something?

20:41.807 --> 20:43.206
What else have you got there?

20:43.207 --> 20:47.206
Get off!

20:52.967 --> 20:56.206
What is this?

20:56.207 --> 20:59.646
Have you done something to him?

20:59.647 --> 21:01.126
What's going on?

21:01.127 --> 21:05.126
The kid from yesterday. I think
he's done something to Simon.

21:31.567 --> 21:33.006
Where's Alisha?

21:33.007 --> 21:34.886
She said she'd meet us here.

21:44.607 --> 21:47.246
You can buy us a drink if you want.

21:47.247 --> 21:49.766
I could do that.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.406
What d'you want?

21:51.407 --> 21:53.086
A pint of lager.

21:53.087 --> 21:55.206
The expensive, French stuff.

21:55.207 --> 21:58.526
A pint of lager.
The expensive French stuff.

21:58.527 --> 22:01.766
And a gin and tonic, please.

22:01.767 --> 22:03.286
A gin and tonic?

22:03.287 --> 22:04.766
I can't drink lager.
It's too gassy.

22:04.767 --> 22:05.806
Are you for real?

22:05.807 --> 22:08.366
Sure you don't want
a little pink umbrella in it?

22:08.367 --> 22:09.846
What's wrong with gin and tonic?

22:09.847 --> 22:11.126
It's what my nan drinks.

22:11.127 --> 22:14.846
Maybe me and your nan
should go out some time. Cheers.

22:14.847 --> 22:17.846
The last bloke she was seeing
fell over and broke his hip.

22:17.847 --> 22:20.886
She's on the market.

22:20.887 --> 22:23.806
What about you?

22:23.807 --> 22:26.566
I'm not seeing anyone.

22:26.567 --> 22:29.126
How about you?

22:29.127 --> 22:31.366
I'll tell my nan you're available.

22:31.367 --> 22:35.366
You do that.

22:36.727 --> 22:38.246
What's going on?

22:38.247 --> 22:39.326
The usual shit.

22:39.327 --> 22:42.486
I don't know what I did with my life
before these powers came along.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.006
You probably hung out in bars,

22:44.007 --> 22:47.286
drinking expensive French lager,
talking to good looking guys.

22:47.287 --> 22:48.766
Something like that.

22:48.767 --> 22:52.766
Kelly.

23:03.407 --> 23:05.766
Thanks for the drink.

23:05.767 --> 23:09.766
Any time.

23:20.047 --> 23:21.926
You made Simon break up with me, didn't you?

23:21.927 --> 23:23.286
I had to.

23:23.287 --> 23:25.686
You don't understand.

23:25.687 --> 23:27.326
It all has to happen.

23:27.327 --> 23:29.726
We ain't debating it with you.
It's over.

23:29.727 --> 23:32.846
Yes, so you either play ball,
or you play hardball.

23:32.847 --> 23:34.846
What does that even mean?

23:34.847 --> 23:38.006
Hardball. It's like a threat,
isn't it? I'm threatening him...

23:38.007 --> 23:42.006
Whoa!

23:53.047 --> 23:55.966
I don't want to hurt you,
but I fucking will.

23:55.967 --> 23:59.966
It all has to happen like this.

24:03.687 --> 24:06.846
Where the fuck have you been
the past few weeks?

24:06.847 --> 24:08.526
Who's he?

24:08.527 --> 24:09.726
He's this guy.

24:09.727 --> 24:12.486
He shows up sometimes
and helps us out with shit.

24:12.487 --> 24:16.486
Right. Well, it's nice to meet you,
man. I'm Rudy and I'm new.

24:18.647 --> 24:21.366
Doesn't say much, does he?

24:21.367 --> 24:23.046
Now you're here,

24:23.047 --> 24:26.366
you can help us kick the shit out of
that little prick.

24:26.367 --> 24:28.206
Kelly, don't. Just leave it, yeah?

24:28.207 --> 24:29.446
You're protecting him now, yeah?

24:29.447 --> 24:33.446
This is bullshit. Come here.

25:00.407 --> 25:02.246
What the fuck just happened?

25:02.247 --> 25:05.006
I thought he was supposed to
be on our side?

25:05.007 --> 25:06.806
I have never even met the guy.

25:06.807 --> 25:08.846
I am, I am, I am new.

25:08.847 --> 25:10.966
I don't know what's going on.

25:10.967 --> 25:14.966
What's going on? Anyone?

25:14.967 --> 25:16.045
No?

25:34.063 --> 25:35.742
When I see that fucker in the mask,

25:35.743 --> 25:38.222
I'm going to beat the shit
out of him.

25:38.223 --> 25:40.462
Ah, the guy in the mask.

25:40.463 --> 25:44.462
I think I know who he is.
I know who he is.

25:44.663 --> 25:46.502
Who is it?

25:46.503 --> 25:48.542
It's the probation worker.

25:48.543 --> 25:50.342
The probation worker?

25:50.343 --> 25:53.582
Yeah, cos that would be fucking
ridiculous, wouldn't it, eh?

25:53.583 --> 25:56.102
Because he wouldn't piss on us
if we were on fire,

25:56.103 --> 26:00.102
and if he was really desperate for a piss.

26:02.543 --> 26:05.822
Well, it's definitely not him, is it?

26:05.823 --> 26:08.302
D'you want to stay over at mine?

26:08.303 --> 26:11.782
Maybe we should all stay over?

26:11.783 --> 26:13.182
Fuck off.

26:13.183 --> 26:17.182
Another time maybe.

26:29.063 --> 26:33.062
I'll have to pick that up later.

26:34.823 --> 26:36.982
Pick it up, then.

26:36.983 --> 26:38.422
Seriously?

26:38.423 --> 26:42.422
Use a bin.

26:44.063 --> 26:46.302
Sorry.

26:46.303 --> 26:48.222
Sorry I had to leave the other night.

26:48.223 --> 26:52.022
Maybe we could do it again
some other time?

26:52.023 --> 26:55.422
Erm, I'm kinda busy.

26:55.423 --> 26:59.422
What? You're busy all the time?

26:59.743 --> 27:01.422
Look, I can't see you like that.

27:01.423 --> 27:04.662
What is it with you?
Yesterday, you're buying me drinks,

27:04.663 --> 27:07.982
talking flirty shit about my nan.
And now you're too busy?

27:07.983 --> 27:11.942
I'm sorry.

27:11.943 --> 27:15.702
Has this got something to do
with the dead girl at the cemetery?

27:15.703 --> 27:17.702
How d'you know about that?

27:17.703 --> 27:19.782
I saw you leave flowers on her grave.

27:19.783 --> 27:21.742
And yeah, I followed you
cos I fancy ya.

27:21.743 --> 27:25.742
Let's just stop all the bullshit.
Who is she?

27:30.903 --> 27:34.902
She's my girlfriend. Er...

27:35.023 --> 27:39.022
she was my girlfriend.

27:40.223 --> 27:44.222
What happened?

27:44.783 --> 27:47.982
She died.

27:47.983 --> 27:51.982
A drugs overdose.

27:54.023 --> 27:56.302
Before the storm,

27:56.303 --> 28:00.302
I was a regular dealer.
I gave her the gear.

28:01.983 --> 28:05.982
I could've stopped her.
She fucking OD'd and it's my fault.

28:06.343 --> 28:09.622
I'm sorry, yeah.

28:09.623 --> 28:13.622
But she's dead, there isn't
anything you can do about it.

28:17.263 --> 28:21.262
I still love her.

28:22.103 --> 28:23.502
I'm sorry.

28:23.503 --> 28:27.502
I never meant to mess you about.

28:46.383 --> 28:50.222
I don't think he's showing up.

28:50.223 --> 28:53.342
This reminds me of when
I met this girl, right?

28:53.343 --> 28:56.342
And we go back to her flat
and we spent the most

28:56.343 --> 28:58.742
amazing night together.

28:58.743 --> 29:01.702
I was head over heels. I loved her,
more than I ever thought

29:01.703 --> 29:04.862
it was possible to love another
human being. Right, anyway,

29:04.863 --> 29:07.902
in the morning, I had to go court
and she makes me promise

29:07.903 --> 29:11.902
that I'd come back. So when I were
done, I rushed all the way back
to her flat and she's not there.

29:12.463 --> 29:16.182
I wait and I wait.
But she never comes.

29:16.183 --> 29:20.182
Right? I went back to that flat
every single day for a month.

29:20.783 --> 29:24.782
Sometimes twice,
even three times a day. But...

29:25.303 --> 29:28.542
she was gone, so...

29:28.543 --> 29:30.062
Did you ever find out
what happened to her?

29:30.063 --> 29:32.142
Oh, no, nothing happened to her, man.

29:32.143 --> 29:35.182
It turned out I'd been going
to the wrong flat.

29:35.183 --> 29:38.142
That is fucking heartbreaking,
innit? Come on, it's all right.

29:38.143 --> 29:39.262
Oh, piss off!

29:39.263 --> 29:43.222
All right. Fair enough. Look, but
don't touch. I hear you, sweetheart.

29:43.223 --> 29:47.222
I'm going to see where he is.

30:01.703 --> 30:05.702
He's with the weird kid,
looking at comics in our flat.

30:05.743 --> 30:06.942
Very romantic.

30:06.943 --> 30:10.942
Oh, no, we've moved on from all the
cheap innuendo about his sexuality.

30:11.063 --> 30:15.062
Go on, carry on, I'm listening now.
What is the plan?

30:24.023 --> 30:25.502
Oh, shit.

30:25.503 --> 30:29.502
It's all right.

30:31.623 --> 30:32.822
I can handle this.

30:32.823 --> 30:36.822
I done a BTEC in computer science.

30:38.543 --> 30:39.622
What're you doing!?

30:39.623 --> 30:41.822
I'm trying to turn off the alarm.

30:41.823 --> 30:45.102
Oh, that's a shame.
That's a shame, it's broken.

30:45.103 --> 30:47.182
Is that what they taught you
on your BTEC in computer science?

30:47.183 --> 30:48.782
I never said I passed it.

30:48.783 --> 30:52.782
Get out of the way.

31:06.583 --> 31:07.902
You're a fucking rocket scientist.

31:07.903 --> 31:11.902
Yes, I fucking am.

31:21.783 --> 31:25.782
This guy really needs
to get out more.

31:25.983 --> 31:29.662
Try some internet dating...

31:29.663 --> 31:33.662
or a salsa class.
I've heard they're...

31:35.183 --> 31:38.622
We're not here to sort out
his social life, are we?

31:38.623 --> 31:42.622
I told you, whatever he draws,
it actually happens.

31:49.423 --> 31:53.422
Rip them up. Maybe that'll stop it.

31:56.943 --> 32:00.102
Are you OK?

32:00.103 --> 32:01.262
I'm fine.

32:01.263 --> 32:05.262
I'll see you later?

32:40.303 --> 32:44.302
Alisha?

33:04.863 --> 33:08.862
I split up with you.
Why would I do that?

33:09.623 --> 33:11.662
What was I thinking?

33:11.663 --> 33:15.662
Look at you.

33:16.263 --> 33:18.942
I want you back.

33:18.943 --> 33:21.062
Let's get back together.

33:21.063 --> 33:23.182
Can we do that?

33:23.183 --> 33:26.742
Don't say no. Please don't say no.

33:26.743 --> 33:30.742
It was Peter's drawings.
Whatever he drew, it came true.

33:32.743 --> 33:36.742
He made you break up with me.

33:36.743 --> 33:38.022
I hurt you.

33:38.023 --> 33:42.022
It wasn't your fault.

33:50.423 --> 33:54.422
I'm so sorry.

34:44.023 --> 34:45.621
I know what you did.

34:45.623 --> 34:49.422
I was just trying to help you.

34:49.422 --> 34:53.422
How can you say that?
You manipulated me.

34:54.422 --> 34:57.422
Alisha doesn't want you to be
who you need to become.

34:57.423 --> 35:00.462
She doesn't understand.

35:00.463 --> 35:03.102
I did it for both of you.

35:03.103 --> 35:06.062
You made me split up with her.

35:06.063 --> 35:07.782
I had to do it.

35:07.783 --> 35:11.782
You told me. You told me
if you don't go back in time,

35:12.543 --> 35:14.622
she'll never fall in love with you.

35:14.623 --> 35:17.462
And if she doesn't
fall in love with you...

35:17.463 --> 35:19.902
Well, you won't do
what you have to do.

35:19.903 --> 35:23.902
You know it better than I do.

35:26.343 --> 35:29.542
Maybe I was wrong.

35:29.543 --> 35:33.542
I thought I had to become him
to protect Alisha.

35:34.503 --> 35:37.222
All I did was hurt her.

35:37.223 --> 35:41.222
I know you can do it.
You can save her.

35:41.663 --> 35:44.222
You're a superhero.

35:44.223 --> 35:48.222
It's your destiny.

35:49.663 --> 35:53.662
I'm not a superhero.

35:53.903 --> 35:56.622
They're a fantasy.

35:56.623 --> 35:59.222
It's your fantasy,

35:59.223 --> 36:00.862
not mine.

36:00.863 --> 36:04.862
I won't ever leave her.

36:19.783 --> 36:21.462
So which one of you is it today?

36:21.463 --> 36:22.982
I'm the good looking one.

36:22.983 --> 36:26.222
You're both equally fuck ugly
as far as I can see.

36:26.223 --> 36:29.022
Right. I pity you, mate.

36:29.023 --> 36:31.382
Your anger. Your bitterness.

36:31.383 --> 36:35.342
Your hatred for all that is good
and pure in the world.

36:35.343 --> 36:38.142
Now, don't take this the wrong
way or anything,

36:38.143 --> 36:42.142
but I think you might have been
sexually abused as a small child.

36:49.543 --> 36:51.262
What's up with you?

36:51.263 --> 36:55.222
A word of advice, don't ever suggest
the probation worker was sexually

36:55.223 --> 36:56.862
abused as a small child.

36:56.863 --> 36:58.702
He did not like that at all.

36:58.703 --> 37:02.702
Funny that.

37:02.983 --> 37:04.542
Looks like those two made up.

37:04.543 --> 37:07.542
Yeah, you know,
in many ways that is a real shame,

37:07.543 --> 37:09.302
cos I reckon I could've tapped that.

37:09.303 --> 37:13.302
Off the rebound. You know what I
mean? Nowt better than a teary fuck.

37:14.143 --> 37:18.142
Wouldn't do it. Wouldn't do that.
Thought never even crossed my mind.

37:18.303 --> 37:33.302
No-one is happier than me
that we are all back to normal.

38:11.103 --> 38:15.102
Ah!

38:18.343 --> 38:22.342
Alisha?

39:08.623 --> 39:11.022
Why are you doing this?!

39:11.023 --> 39:15.022
What do you want?!
Please, will you just let me go?!

39:46.903 --> 39:48.862
Mmm! Mmm!

39:48.863 --> 39:51.702
Mmm!

39:51.703 --> 39:55.702
Ah!

40:38.023 --> 40:40.422
Are you OK? Did he hurt you?

40:40.423 --> 40:44.422
I'm fine.

41:01.663 --> 41:03.902
Why?

41:03.903 --> 41:06.542
Why did you do it?

41:06.543 --> 41:09.622
You did it.

41:09.623 --> 41:13.622
You... You saved her.

41:13.983 --> 41:16.902
A superhero

41:16.903 --> 41:20.902
has to be prepared to die
for what he believes in.

41:50.263 --> 41:53.662
Alisha?

41:53.663 --> 41:57.662
It's like watching you die all over again.

41:59.543 --> 42:03.542
I don't want you to become him.

42:03.863 --> 42:06.902
I want you to stay here with me.

42:06.903 --> 42:09.022
You don't have to go back.

42:09.023 --> 42:12.222
Promise me you won't go back.

42:12.223 --> 42:15.502
Promise me.

42:15.503 --> 42:19.502
I promise.

42:23.743 --> 42:27.742
I don't want you to put that suit on
ever again.

42:32.623 --> 42:34.622
Burn it.

42:34.623 --> 42:38.622
With him.

43:43.703 --> 43:47.702
I did it.
