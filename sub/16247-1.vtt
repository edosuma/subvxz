00:14.314 --> 00:15.816
Long ago...

00:16.015 --> 00:19.725
<i>the Medicine Game was given to
the people of the Haudenosaunee...</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:23.331
<i>to entertain the Creator.</i>

03:17.897 --> 03:20.173
Holy stick work!

03:20.366 --> 03:23.347
Somebody better mail that guy's helmet
back from Syracuse.

03:29.042 --> 03:34.958
Outlet pass and Coventry Academy is pulling
off another dominating coast-to-coast play.

03:46.826 --> 03:48.772
Another goal for Coventry Academy!

03:49.329 --> 03:52.799
All-Star middie Clay Watson
just obliterated a Sunaquot defender.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.172
- Chewy, take him out!
- How did you miss that?

03:55.368 --> 03:57.974
- Are you all right?
- I can't move it.

04:02.442 --> 04:03.477
Let's bring it in.

04:03.676 --> 04:07.852
And at halftime, the defending champs lead
the over matched Sunaquot, eight to three.

04:08.047 --> 04:11.517
It's game one of the season
and it's time for this team to tap out.

04:11.718 --> 04:15.689
If anyone's still listening, please enjoy
this commercial-free intermission...

04:15.888 --> 04:20.564
as we still have no sponsors, here on
the Bryan Sports Broadcasting Network...

04:20.760 --> 04:25.402
the number one and only radio show
covering upstate prep school lacrosse...

04:25.598 --> 04:29.910
and streaming live on BSBN.com.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.549
All right, guys, bunch up.

04:32.739 --> 04:37.654
Listen, they are a very good team.
But we can be too.

04:37.844 --> 04:41.121
We have got to bring our minds
together as one.

04:41.581 --> 04:45.188
- Chewy, you gotta move your feet.
- I do move my feet. They move theirs faster.

04:45.385 --> 04:48.161
Reed, you can stop some shots
if you take a step toward the shooter.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.334
- Cut down the angle.
- I was protecting my backside.

04:50.523 --> 04:53.527
This ain't dodge ball, moron.
Your job is to try and get hit.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.899
And your job is to pass the ball, Jimmy.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.769
Owen was wide open
when you got your ass handed to you.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.967
Oh, whipped.

05:04.003 --> 05:06.108
Owen. Sammy. Enough.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.684
Starters, get ready for the second half.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.219
We'd be better off scrimmaging
our middle-school team.

05:11.411 --> 05:13.413
But I'm not gonna let today go to waste.

05:13.613 --> 05:17.220
In the second half,
I want you all using your weak hands.

05:17.417 --> 05:20.626
But don't you let up. Not for one second.
Remember who we are.

05:20.853 --> 05:22.355
Scared to go back?

05:22.555 --> 05:25.195
- I'm hurt.
- Your feelings or your shoulder?

05:25.391 --> 05:27.894
A kiss would fix both.

05:29.762 --> 05:31.833
- Toby, you're in.
- Me?

05:32.031 --> 05:34.375
- At attack.
- Against Coventry?

05:35.168 --> 05:37.409
Okay...

05:47.213 --> 05:49.523
Number 17 is a real firecracker.

05:49.716 --> 05:53.220
Keep it up! Give him that shaft!
Get him, Nadie!

05:53.419 --> 05:57.868
This guy is frustrating the Coventry
offense with relentless position defense.

06:05.631 --> 06:09.875
Number 17 is blindsided by an illegal hit.

06:11.070 --> 06:13.209
You gotta be kidding me, man!

06:13.906 --> 06:19.322
Here we go! It's a fight, folks!
A rumble on the rez.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.720
Watson, Dawes, enough!

06:24.117 --> 06:26.358
Come on, boy. Want a taste, Wonder Bread?

06:29.455 --> 06:30.763
- Back! Get back.
- Jimmy!

06:30.957 --> 06:34.268
Jimmy, sideline!

06:34.460 --> 06:36.440
Keep your helmet on!

06:36.863 --> 06:38.308
Geronimo!

06:39.465 --> 06:43.504
Get off of him! Chewy, on the bench!

06:43.703 --> 06:45.614
- Get off of him!
- Enough!

06:45.805 --> 06:47.079
Keep your helmets on.

06:47.273 --> 06:49.446
Sam my, stop it.

06:52.311 --> 06:53.813
Nadie.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.322
- Come on.
- No!

06:58.084 --> 07:01.429
Stay there!
They're not worth it anyways!

07:04.190 --> 07:09.936
<i>Hey, seems as though you got me shaking</i>

07:10.129 --> 07:15.101
<i>Hey, you make me cry</i>

07:15.501 --> 07:18.607
<i>You start me up</i>
<i>And then you leave</i>

07:18.805 --> 07:21.752
<i>You're changing right in front of me</i>

07:35.721 --> 07:37.792
Yeah!

07:37.990 --> 07:39.367
Winning some wampum, ladies?

07:39.559 --> 07:40.833
Oh, my God!

07:41.027 --> 07:44.907
Three Tom Hot Toddies.
I want to get that jackpot back.

07:45.097 --> 07:46.906
Don't shoot, Chief.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.410
Oh! Five dollar free play!

07:51.137 --> 07:53.913
Impressive stacks, ladies.

07:54.106 --> 07:56.086
Hey. Got a fortune for me, Chief y?

07:56.275 --> 08:00.382
Of course. Chief y always has fortunes
for beautiful Indian maidens.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.186
- There you go.
- I hope he has one for me too.

08:03.382 --> 08:04.690
Mr. Geyer.

08:04.884 --> 08:09.390
Ladies, if you don't mind,
I'd like to borrow Chief y for a minute.

08:14.594 --> 08:17.200
That's impressive design work, Joe.

08:17.396 --> 08:20.138
But how far have you gotten
with the casino expansion rights?

08:20.333 --> 08:24.110
Almost there. I'm meeting
with my primary opposition this evening.

08:27.406 --> 08:33.721
Joe, I came to you with this deal because
you were a closer when you worked for me.

08:33.913 --> 08:37.827
And I can guarantee a full partnership
if you pull this off.

08:38.017 --> 08:41.520
But there are a lot of other poor Indian
tribes out there with wasted land.

08:41.721 --> 08:45.567
Yes, but we Sunaquot are poorer
and more wasted than most.

08:45.758 --> 08:49.570
I want to help your people,
but I can't wait forever.

08:53.833 --> 08:59.784
Look, tell your people
whatever it is they want to hear...

09:00.406 --> 09:03.285
and get my deal done.

09:23.095 --> 09:25.735
Nadie, you need to get that leg elevated.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.709
This is your fault.

09:36.108 --> 09:37.985
Why did you enter the game?

09:38.177 --> 09:40.657
Because nobody else would go in, Daddy.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.290
And I was kicking ass out there,
you saw me play.

09:45.484 --> 09:46.963
And I heard the doctor.

09:47.153 --> 09:50.760
And if you don't heal properly,
you may never play again.

09:53.492 --> 09:55.062
I've got a meeting at the Pow Wow.

09:55.261 --> 10:00.267
You stay with her, this pain medication
can have some side effects.

10:02.201 --> 10:05.739
Oh, no funny business, you two.

10:06.572 --> 10:10.315
Right, because I can't wait to hook up with the
guy that got my ankle broken in two places.

10:10.509 --> 10:13.922
I told you, it's not my fault.
Nobody made you go in the game.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.024
Okay, nobody had to, Jimmy.

10:16.215 --> 10:19.890
We needed a player and you were hurt,
so I stepped up.

10:26.192 --> 10:29.605
Okay, I said leave me alone!

10:30.696 --> 10:32.937
Now we know the side effects.

10:50.683 --> 10:51.855
Good day for a Pow Wow.

10:54.253 --> 10:55.857
How you doing, man?

10:56.055 --> 10:58.262
Hey, Rollingstone. What's up, my man?

10:58.824 --> 11:00.064
It's Rollingwind.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.205
I've told you like 10 times before.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.703
Yeah, I meant that.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.570
Julie? Julie Gifford?

11:08.768 --> 11:09.974
What are you doing here?

11:10.169 --> 11:13.150
- I teach high school.
- Since when?

11:13.339 --> 11:15.341
Like two weeks ago.
What are you doing here?

11:15.541 --> 11:17.214
I run the casino.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.891
So how you been?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.650
I'm good. I'm really good.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.725
The casino?

11:24.917 --> 11:27.693
Figures. Joe Money
pimping out his people.

11:28.654 --> 11:31.066
Really?

11:31.257 --> 11:35.501
You do know that my casino profits
paid for your brand-new school buildings.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.539
So if I'm a pimp,
what does that make you?

11:40.633 --> 11:42.544
Grandma!

11:44.937 --> 11:46.644
Julie!

12:01.554 --> 12:06.025
Of all the teachers in New York,
you just had to hire my ex-girlfriend?

12:06.225 --> 12:09.434
Dr. Gifford is more than a teacher.

12:09.628 --> 12:10.629
Doctor?

12:10.830 --> 12:15.176
Julie wrote the only book there is
about the Sunaquot culture.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.842
You should take one.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.074
It's very enlightening.

12:20.539 --> 12:23.952
And she was the only applicant
we could afford to pay.

12:24.610 --> 12:28.956
Which is a perfect reason
you should deed more land to the casino.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.294
You know my position, son.
We have no more land.

12:32.885 --> 12:34.887
Dad, land is all we have.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.226
And land is all we need.

12:37.690 --> 12:41.399
Come on, let's just enjoy the celebration.

12:41.794 --> 12:44.832
Celebration? What celebration?

12:46.265 --> 12:48.211
Nobody came to the Pow Wow.

12:48.701 --> 12:51.307
Drive downtown
and see the men begging for work.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.984
And then tell me
that the land is all our people need.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.484
Our people.

12:57.343 --> 12:59.653
We haven't been your people
for quite some time, son.

12:59.845 --> 13:03.520
Well, I'm here now, and I have a plan.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.094
But I'm running out of time.

13:10.489 --> 13:13.163
It'd be nice to have your support
at the tribal council.

13:13.359 --> 13:17.705
Not just as an elected official,
but as my father.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.406
How'd she get her pajamas on?

13:52.998 --> 13:57.105
I didn't look, Mr. Logan. I swear.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.886
Our partner, Geyer Enterprises, projects
that our annual share of gaming revenue...

14:05.077 --> 14:06.818
will exceed 10 million dollars.

14:07.012 --> 14:11.825
And in five years, we'd be able to build
a hospital, along with the school.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.391
But can we trust his vision?

14:15.588 --> 14:16.760
Have you seen his casino?

14:16.956 --> 14:19.368
We have seen the new school buildings...

14:19.558 --> 14:24.769
and have decided that Abooksigun may build on
the land between the casino and the river.

14:24.964 --> 14:27.968
What? This is not acceptable.

14:28.167 --> 14:32.013
Your blood cloud your vision, Hagawa?
We are not finished.

14:32.504 --> 14:35.485
Abooksigun, you may expand the casino...

14:35.674 --> 14:38.621
under the condition
that you first re-examine your spirit...

14:38.811 --> 14:43.885
and prove yourself worthy
in the manner of your father's choosing.

14:46.919 --> 14:49.695
You play redskin to the whites,
then white to your people.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.232
It's just for show.

14:51.423 --> 14:52.766
To show what exactly?

14:52.958 --> 14:55.268
Hey, Grandma.

14:55.461 --> 14:58.499
You have forced me
into a very difficult position, Mother.

14:58.697 --> 15:00.734
For the good of our people.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.571
Yes.

15:02.768 --> 15:05.578
Hey, Lady Bug, how is the leg?

15:05.771 --> 15:08.775
- It still hurts a little.
- Keep it elevated.

15:08.974 --> 15:12.080
- So the swelling goes down.
- I am.

15:12.278 --> 15:16.658
I have decided the manner
of your spirit quest.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.125
You will return to the Creator's game.

15:19.985 --> 15:22.556
Return? You mean, like, play?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.792
No, you don't play.

15:24.990 --> 15:29.200
Our coach quit
and I'm not a suitable replacement.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.400
Well, neither am I.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.133
I have a business to run.

15:33.332 --> 15:36.279
Which will not expand as you wish,
unless you do as I require.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.104
Dad, you know why I don't play anymore.

15:39.305 --> 15:42.946
I do, and they call it
the "medicine game" for a reason.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.154
Let it heal you.

15:45.477 --> 15:48.185
Our next game is tomorrow,
the season ends on Memorial Day.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.759
I'm only half Sunaquot,
shouldn't that mean only half a season?

15:53.218 --> 15:56.859
Restore pride to our people,
and their game.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.161
That is your first obligation.

15:59.358 --> 16:01.861
- There's more?
- To re-examine your spirit.

16:02.061 --> 16:06.066
Yeah, can you give me some
defined deliverables on that?

16:06.265 --> 16:09.269
No, but I know who can.

16:10.369 --> 16:13.350
Is it within my power to assign
him a spiritual advisor?

16:13.539 --> 16:15.177
It is most certainly.

16:15.374 --> 16:18.355
Good, then I assign you.

16:22.748 --> 16:24.455
So, what? You're my babysitter now?

16:25.851 --> 16:28.229
That's howl roll, baby.

16:30.522 --> 16:32.126
Great.

16:36.462 --> 16:41.935
<i>I like the ones who, I like the ones who</i>
<i>I like the ones</i>

16:42.134 --> 16:45.707
<i>I like the ones who like to show me things</i>

16:54.980 --> 16:56.891
Oh, man.

16:57.316 --> 16:59.091
Gentlemen.

16:59.618 --> 17:01.689
Look at this.

17:01.887 --> 17:05.925
You're late.
Doesn't your fancy car have a clock?

17:06.125 --> 17:09.163
Yeah, it has GPS navigation too.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.271
I had to make a pit stop.

17:11.463 --> 17:12.839
Man, you have a nice car here.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.279
You two brothers or cousins?

17:16.468 --> 17:17.571
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.442
Okay, then.

17:21.607 --> 17:25.020
All right, you two play attack,
you three middie...

17:25.210 --> 17:28.919
you three defense,
and I guess that makes you goalie.

17:30.682 --> 17:33.595
I'm your new coach.

17:37.489 --> 17:39.400
Watch the cutters.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.404
Go!

17:43.962 --> 17:45.032
That was quick.

17:45.230 --> 17:49.269
The new suit on the sideline hasn't
made a big difference for the Sunaquot.

17:49.468 --> 17:51.243
Come on, guys.

17:53.639 --> 17:55.482
Who's got point?

17:56.575 --> 18:00.216
Reed, be aggressive!
Play your position.

18:06.985 --> 18:09.761
Yeah, no, I know.
Yeah, it's a convertible.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.698
You've got to hit him, Chewy!

18:12.891 --> 18:14.564
Chewy, can you hit him?

18:14.760 --> 18:17.263
Like you're any better, pretty boy
Why don't you step up?

18:17.463 --> 18:18.999
I'll be there after this game.

18:19.198 --> 18:22.077
Yeah, I'll sign the check.
Just stall them, all right?

18:23.535 --> 18:27.039
Hey. Unless you're Googling halftime
speeches that don't totally suck...

18:27.239 --> 18:30.049
I suggest you put that down and coach.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.323
- Stay in the game, man!
- Fine.

18:33.512 --> 18:38.188
All right, guys, they're in a zone.
Run Z82 and work it around the wings.

18:38.383 --> 18:41.091
Joe, they have no idea what that means.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.197
Yeah, but it sounds good.

18:43.388 --> 18:45.129
Jimmy! Over here! Yo! Yo! I'm open.

18:46.758 --> 18:48.738
Ball hog! Owen was wide open.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.735
- Get out.
- Z82? It's not even a real play.

18:52.931 --> 18:55.070
Sounds like a radio station.

18:56.168 --> 18:59.081
You, you're in,
as long as you don't hog the ball too.

18:59.271 --> 19:00.443
Good luck with that.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.310
Hey, who's the dorky white kid?

19:03.509 --> 19:06.353
It's Toby, Dr. Gifford's son.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.422
Julie has a son?

19:08.614 --> 19:10.685
Yeah, and he just got crushed.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.020
Welcome to the club, kid.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.404
<i>So how did your meeting</i>
<i>go with our opposition?</i>

19:24.596 --> 19:26.940
How much land
are you able to deliver, Joe?

19:27.132 --> 19:30.272
The council approved construction
on the land here...

19:30.469 --> 19:32.847
where the current casino is,
up to the river here.

19:33.038 --> 19:36.076
Great. We will break ground next week.

19:36.441 --> 19:39.149
Actually, that's where we had to make
one concession.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.047
We can't go until the end of May.

19:41.246 --> 19:42.589
But that's two months.

19:42.781 --> 19:45.625
I know. It's an ancient tribal law.

19:45.817 --> 19:48.093
What law? I thought you were my insider.

19:48.287 --> 19:51.530
I am. It's called:

19:53.225 --> 19:57.605
It means "No disturb land in spring."

19:57.796 --> 20:00.276
Your people didn't farm in the spring?

20:00.899 --> 20:02.674
No, not really.

20:02.868 --> 20:06.406
They were more hunter-gatherer,
scavenger types.

20:06.605 --> 20:09.745
Like bears,
with a little bit of vulture mixed in.

20:09.942 --> 20:13.253
My clan name means Vulture Bear.

20:14.813 --> 20:17.760
I need a start date, Joe.

20:17.950 --> 20:18.951
N ow.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.496
The day after Memorial Day.

20:23.222 --> 20:27.671
You're sure? There are no other ancient
tribal traditions I need worry about?

20:27.859 --> 20:29.395
No.

20:30.395 --> 20:33.103
This is from last night's reading.

20:33.298 --> 20:38.941
"Loving that Land O' Lakes Maiden,"
by an Onondaga poet, Eric Gansworth.

20:39.137 --> 20:44.951
<i>She is the first lesson in love for many</i>
<i>Indian boys, all tanned hide and feathers</i>

20:45.978 --> 20:51.257
<i>Features straight out of Hollywood</i>
<i>But she lights the spark for those red boys</i>

20:51.450 --> 20:55.557
<i>And probably for some</i>
<i>Black and white and brown ones as well</i>

20:56.755 --> 21:03.001
<i>For anyone who learns her tricks, really</i>
<i>And they're not that hard to master</i>

21:04.463 --> 21:06.409
So, what's this poem about?

21:08.367 --> 21:10.779
That smoking-hot Indian lady
on the butter package.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.978
Yes, Reed, that's clearly stated
in the title, but what else?

21:16.174 --> 21:21.385
That smoking-hot Indian lady is a stereotype
we Native American women have to overcome.

21:21.580 --> 21:25.027
We don't spread easy like butter,
we can be tough and strong.

21:26.251 --> 21:28.731
Jimmy, your thoughts?

21:29.588 --> 21:32.068
I think nobody cares about poetry.

21:32.257 --> 21:35.329
I do. Actually I happen to love poetry.

21:36.662 --> 21:38.608
Well, in that case...

21:41.433 --> 21:45.779
<i>Nadie, my wounded lady</i>
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

21:45.971 --> 21:49.646
<i>I'm strong, tough</i>
<i>And man enough to churn your butter nightly</i>

21:51.176 --> 21:52.883
Chewy

22:15.000 --> 22:16.911
Nice shot.
Now Maug has got another one.

22:17.102 --> 22:20.777
Grandma, I'm not late today. Sis.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.520
All right, bring it in.

22:38.957 --> 22:41.904
So that was pretty pathetic yesterday.

22:42.094 --> 22:45.473
No focus, no fitness,
and zero team work.

22:45.664 --> 22:47.769
We're gonna start over
with the fundamentals.

22:47.966 --> 22:50.810
Passing and catching, line drills. Go.

22:51.002 --> 22:52.811
Can't. No balls.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.813
Maug's got them.

22:55.006 --> 22:57.247
Okay. Who's Maug?

22:57.442 --> 22:58.944
Protector of the forest.

22:59.144 --> 23:01.647
Six-foot-10,
300 pounds of pure muscle.

23:01.847 --> 23:05.317
Catch a deer
with his bare hands, eat it raw.

23:05.517 --> 23:08.498
What you're saying is we're calling
practice on account of Sasquatch?

23:08.687 --> 23:10.462
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Yeah.

23:11.623 --> 23:13.261
Works for me.

23:14.092 --> 23:17.437
- How about you go buy us some more balls?
- Yeah.

23:17.662 --> 23:20.871
How about you man up, Jimmy, and go
into the woods and get them yourself?

23:22.534 --> 23:25.640
How about you call me Silverfoot.
How about you make me?

23:27.572 --> 23:28.983
Today's lesson:

23:29.174 --> 23:32.246
If you're afraid to go into the forest,
you've got no balls.

23:34.279 --> 23:35.383
Come on, Jimmy.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.753
We ain't got no balls.
You're the one walking away.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.660
Look at him, with his face buried
in that Crackberry all day.

23:43.054 --> 23:44.965
So tell me then,
how's your fitness, coach?

23:48.493 --> 23:51.702
You want to go? We can go.

23:52.998 --> 23:54.875
Everybody. On the line.

23:55.066 --> 23:57.137
Oh, come on.

23:58.203 --> 23:59.511
Ready?

24:35.006 --> 24:37.418
Maybe you could coach baseball.

24:37.609 --> 24:40.055
Strike three. You're out.

24:41.012 --> 24:43.925
Dude, Italian leather boots.

24:48.520 --> 24:52.127
I'll show up if I have to,
but I can't coach these guys.

24:54.092 --> 24:57.938
There's no weak warriors, Abooksigun,
only weak leaders.

24:58.129 --> 25:01.667
And in this case, weak and slow.

25:50.315 --> 25:52.886
There was a time
when you beat the sun, Abooksigun.

25:53.084 --> 25:54.995
Crooked Arrow.

25:55.487 --> 25:58.661
I hear you have returned
to the Creator's game.

25:59.524 --> 26:02.528
Yeah, I'm sure you've heard why.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.673
I also heard you're are O and 2.

26:06.464 --> 26:09.308
Yeah, I don't know what to do.

26:09.501 --> 26:12.038
These kids have had sticks
in their cradles.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.643
But they're a joke right now.

26:14.839 --> 26:16.910
Do you remember the story
of the eagle and the arrow?

26:18.243 --> 26:19.415
No.

26:19.611 --> 26:22.615
The eagle once ruled our skies.

26:22.814 --> 26:27.194
<i>And then, one day,</i>
<i>he was struck down by the arrow.</i>

26:27.385 --> 26:32.494
<i>As he lay dying,</i>
<i>the eagle could not understand why.</i>

26:34.659 --> 26:39.472
The shaft of the arrow had been feathered
by one of his own plumes.

26:39.664 --> 26:42.508
We often give our enemies
the means to our own defeat.

26:44.002 --> 26:46.039
Look inside.

26:46.237 --> 26:48.478
Ask your heart.

26:49.040 --> 26:53.420
The truth may sleep, but it never dies.

26:57.716 --> 27:01.357
It was only an oral language
until Hiawatha transcribed...

27:01.553 --> 27:06.502
the Haudenosaunee constitution
onto a wampum belt. Later, Ben Franklin...

27:07.892 --> 27:11.101
copied your version
of three equal branches of government.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.331
Go.

27:12.530 --> 27:16.535
His famous quote, "if a bunch
of ignorant savages can govern fairly..."

27:16.735 --> 27:18.442
then we should be
able to do the same"...

27:18.637 --> 27:21.481
- ...is the foundation of American democracy.
- What you want me to do?

27:21.673 --> 27:22.674
Nadie?

27:22.874 --> 27:24.683
What's going on?

27:24.876 --> 27:26.651
Nothing.

27:32.117 --> 27:33.323
Time for practice.

27:33.518 --> 27:37.933
This is my classroom,
and we will stay until I say otherwise.

27:38.123 --> 27:41.127
So you like your new school so much,
you want to keep the kids late?

27:41.326 --> 27:46.071
Even if it means denying them the opportunity to
participate in a traditional cultural heritage?

27:46.264 --> 27:48.870
Oh, well, maybe I can make it up
to them with afield trip...

27:49.067 --> 27:52.742
to go visit Chief Wampum
and his bar-dancing waitresses.

27:52.937 --> 27:55.349
Speaking of which, we're hiring,
if you can dance.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.349
And she can, she was a cheerleader.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.954
And valedictorian,
which your coach can't even spell.

28:00.145 --> 28:02.648
Well, I guess I'll just sit out here
where it's warm and sunny...

28:02.847 --> 28:05.020
with a trunk load of surprises
for the lacrosse team.

28:05.216 --> 28:08.322
- Yo, are you serious?
- What? That's us. We gotta get our buddy.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.663
All right, fine.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.860
But we have a history test on Friday.

28:15.794 --> 28:18.638
So I was thinking about what
happened when we raced.

28:18.830 --> 28:21.538
When I smoked your ass?

28:22.600 --> 28:23.977
I wasn't properly equipped.

28:24.169 --> 28:25.910
Yeah, right.

28:26.104 --> 28:29.916
We've been giving our enemies
the means to defeat us.

28:30.108 --> 28:31.416
But not anymore.

28:32.977 --> 28:35.890
Reebok, best on the market.

28:38.283 --> 28:40.923
- That's awesome.
- No way.

28:41.119 --> 28:43.395
Little bang stick, 10K.

28:43.588 --> 28:45.158
Look at this.

28:45.356 --> 28:47.996
Look at the bag in it, man.

28:48.193 --> 28:49.900
And that's not all.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.464
Thank you, Marilyn.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.638
Marilyn stayed up all night
making these.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.880
Oh, Jackpots.

29:00.872 --> 29:02.818
Gotta look good to be good, right?

29:03.007 --> 29:06.011
<i>That did not look good for the Jackpots.</i>

29:06.211 --> 29:09.954
Despite a makeover, the Sunaquot goalie
<i>stood planted like a tree in the crease...</i>

29:10.148 --> 29:12.128
<i>insuring the loss to Sulgrave.</i>

29:12.317 --> 29:15.298
<i>Today's broadcast was brought to you</i>
<i>by our very first sponsor...</i>

29:15.487 --> 29:17.660
<i>the Lucky Indian Casino,</i>
<i>where the Big Game...</i>

29:19.057 --> 29:21.970
- Ten dollar free play at Lucky Indian Casino.
- Joe Logan?

29:22.160 --> 29:25.733
- Yeah, that's my name, just use it at the door.
- You played for Coventry in '98, right?

29:25.930 --> 29:27.739
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

29:27.932 --> 29:31.539
No, I played here, at Sulgrave.
Senior year you destroyed us.

29:31.736 --> 29:33.682
Yeah, if you say so.

29:34.172 --> 29:37.210
He's being humble. This guy right
here, the best I've ever seen.

29:37.408 --> 29:42.881
You went to Syracuse, right?
They called you Logan the Legend.

29:43.081 --> 29:45.823
But whatever happened
in that championship game?

29:48.486 --> 29:50.762
Sorry, man, we gotta go.
Here's another coupon.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.128
Congrats on the win.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.398
Okay, sure.

29:57.395 --> 29:58.703
Good luck!

31:19.911 --> 31:22.755
<i>Logan! Logan! Logan!</i>

32:04.756 --> 32:06.258
What you doing?

32:06.724 --> 32:09.637
Hey! She walks.

32:10.595 --> 32:14.509
I was just looking for this.

32:14.699 --> 32:18.613
I've been doing a lot of driving lately
and, you know, trying to keep it fresh.

32:18.803 --> 32:21.579
Chumbawamba...

32:22.340 --> 32:27.050
Come on, these guys were awesome
for the one song.

32:27.245 --> 32:28.986
Can I look?

32:29.714 --> 32:32.888
No, not tonight.

32:33.084 --> 32:36.429
Okay, total strangers
know my brother better than I do.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.895
Logan the Legend?

32:38.523 --> 32:40.730
I actually prefer Joey Hustle.

32:40.925 --> 32:43.838
Whatever, they're equally lame.

32:47.031 --> 32:48.840
What was she like?

32:49.434 --> 32:52.313
Strong, like you.

32:53.838 --> 32:55.545
Then how could she die so young.

32:56.541 --> 32:59.420
There was no hospital at the reservation.

33:00.912 --> 33:05.383
But I can fix that now, if Dad will let me.

33:12.123 --> 33:14.660
Oh, my God, is that Dr. Gifford with you?

33:14.859 --> 33:17.430
Yeah, we dated at Coventry.

33:17.628 --> 33:19.005
No way.

33:19.197 --> 33:22.201
Yeah way.
I wouldn't bring it up to her though.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.311
- Okay.
- Let's have some tunes.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.708
Tunes.

33:25.903 --> 33:27.940
Yeah, that's what we
used to say in the '90s.

33:30.541 --> 33:33.351
<i>I get knocked down, but I get up again</i>

33:33.544 --> 33:35.649
- Are we really gonna listen to that?
- Oh, yeah.

33:38.216 --> 33:41.322
All right, guys, take your pads off.
Don't need them today.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.328
What? No practice?

33:43.521 --> 33:45.432
Nope. No practice.

33:45.623 --> 33:47.398
Yeah.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.731
We're running.

33:49.927 --> 33:52.100
Up there, to Defiance Rock.

33:52.296 --> 33:56.108
How about you drag your old butt up there
and then you can tell us all about it.

33:58.669 --> 34:00.307
I'll make you a deal.

34:00.505 --> 34:03.486
You give me four balls, I'll rip all
four corners with Reed in goal.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.819
If I miss, I go alone.

34:08.012 --> 34:11.083
If I hit them all, we all run.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.725
- Take it.
- Take that.

34:14.485 --> 34:15.759
I gotta see this.

34:21.025 --> 34:23.164
Reed, you better save this, man.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.103
He can't shoot.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.206
- Come on, Reed.
- Come on, Reed.

34:35.773 --> 34:38.379
What's that?

34:38.576 --> 34:39.987
Lucky.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.820
Can't you stop an old man?

35:01.933 --> 35:04.004
Reed, you should have stopped that one.

35:04.202 --> 35:06.182
Right here, gramps, come on.

35:07.371 --> 35:09.408
- Come on, Reed.
- Come on, Reed.

35:29.393 --> 35:31.168
What the...?

35:39.504 --> 35:41.848
- We're running.
- That was cheating.

35:42.039 --> 35:44.815
- Why didn't you tell him to hit the bar?
- Why did you take that bet?

35:45.009 --> 35:46.750
Come on, come on, coach!

35:48.045 --> 35:49.752
Come on, Reed, get bent.

35:49.947 --> 35:51.483
Guys, wait up.

36:00.024 --> 36:05.497
<i>And this one's for the fall</i>
<i>And this one's for the earth we never had</i>

36:08.099 --> 36:09.373
What's with the stick?

36:09.567 --> 36:13.982
Maug, he's here. He's everywhere, watching.

36:14.172 --> 36:18.052
You do know that predators go
for the slowest in the herd, right?

36:22.547 --> 36:24.527
Take a right at the dead tree.

36:48.072 --> 36:50.951
How old does my butt look now, Jimbo?

36:51.776 --> 36:52.777
<i>Go!</i>

36:55.947 --> 36:59.019
You almost beat the sun.

37:06.357 --> 37:10.169
Man, there's a reason
the white man invented cable cars.

37:10.361 --> 37:12.272
Guard your tongue in youth.

37:12.463 --> 37:16.536
And in age you may mature a thought
that will be of service to your people.

37:18.135 --> 37:21.014
How long does it take you to make one?

37:21.205 --> 37:25.051
I don't make them, the Creator does.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.315
This hickory tree is older than you.

37:28.512 --> 37:33.757
I carve away all but the heart,
leaving only power and strength.

37:37.588 --> 37:41.263
Your opponent does not want
to be clubbed by one.

37:42.326 --> 37:45.034
This was my great grandfather's.

37:46.030 --> 37:47.805
Over 200 years old.

37:48.899 --> 37:52.312
And strong as the day it was made.

37:52.503 --> 37:56.974
But metal sticks have offset heads. With
that you'd have to cradle all the time.

37:57.508 --> 38:01.513
Don't worry, the offset
head will fit on this.

38:01.712 --> 38:08.095
The ball lives in the offset head,
but the spirit lives in the stick.

38:08.686 --> 38:14.329
I may be old, but I'm not out of touch
I watch ESPNU on my iPad.

38:17.895 --> 38:19.499
What's this?

38:19.697 --> 38:22.405
That's the Crooked Arrow,
my Sunaquot name.

38:23.668 --> 38:26.911
I have made sticks and arrows
for generations.

38:27.104 --> 38:30.517
Each one is different,
and none are perfect.

38:31.175 --> 38:33.621
No arrow flies straight.

38:34.078 --> 38:36.058
There's nothing wrong
with a crooked arrow.

38:37.581 --> 38:42.621
As long as it follows its own path,
it will find its way.

38:43.721 --> 38:45.496
Sticks up.

38:48.392 --> 38:52.772
Creator gave the game to the people
of the Haudenosaunee Nation.

38:53.764 --> 38:57.837
<i>They played and it pleased the Creator.</i>

38:58.502 --> 39:04.885
Now go play the game for our ancestors who
are no longer here to entertain the Creator.

39:13.050 --> 39:15.826
You put a lot of work into these.
How much do I owe you?

39:16.020 --> 39:17.431
You want to repay me?

39:20.324 --> 39:22.770
Return lacrosse to our people.

39:26.831 --> 39:28.811
Welcome back to the rez, lacrosse fans.

39:29.266 --> 39:32.577
Not that this game will qualify as lacrosse
against the beleaguered Jacked...

39:34.138 --> 39:35.879
Pots.

39:37.675 --> 39:40.622
- Hey, Chad.
- Hello, Nadie.

39:40.811 --> 39:42.848
Yeah, we're not the Jacked Pots any more.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.493
Crooked Arrows! Yahoo!

39:59.196 --> 40:00.732
And Chad?

40:00.931 --> 40:06.142
How about you show us some respect
on our land, okay?

40:11.275 --> 40:13.346
Two. We're up by two. B line get in there.

40:13.544 --> 40:14.955
We're late in the third...

40:15.146 --> 40:18.525
and the newly minted Crooked Arrows
have put in a surprising effort.

40:19.183 --> 40:20.594
Come on. Come on, Jimmy.

40:24.455 --> 40:27.834
Head up, head up, head up. Come on.

40:29.827 --> 40:30.965
Nice pick.

40:33.831 --> 40:35.504
Yes!

40:37.635 --> 40:40.514
Nice! All right, all right.

40:43.507 --> 40:46.750
That's not all right. That's not... Jimmy!

40:46.944 --> 40:49.618
Hey! Hey, Silverfoot, knock it off.

40:50.581 --> 40:52.083
Keep showboating.

40:52.383 --> 40:55.796
Keep dancing, twinkle toes. Keep smiling.

40:56.153 --> 41:00.363
Yeah, you're smiling now.
You won't be smiling later.

41:01.759 --> 41:03.500
Let's see some sweat, jock straps.

41:03.694 --> 41:07.733
I'm not running a ballet here, Silvertoes,
this isn't "Dance of the Sugar Plums."

41:07.932 --> 41:09.843
You want to be a ballerina,
plié off to Broadway.

41:10.034 --> 41:11.809
You want to play lacrosse,
respect your team.

41:15.239 --> 41:16.547
What did you guys say?

41:20.511 --> 41:23.458
Hey, hey! Guys, guys, break it up, okay?
Come on.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.456
No secrets now, we're a team.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.151
We all speak the same language.

41:32.223 --> 41:35.761
- Keep them running till I get back.
- Okay. Ready?

41:41.966 --> 41:43.639
Keeping office hours, Dr. Gifford?

41:45.469 --> 41:47.107
I need Jimmy when you're through with him.

41:47.304 --> 41:51.480
We've got a problem with him graduating.
He's failing English.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.985
You know, I always thought
you'd be a teacher.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.988
Location is a bit of a surprise.

41:57.481 --> 42:01.588
Your people made quite an impression
on me, coach.

42:03.120 --> 42:07.193
Did you know that Jimmy
doesn't understand a word of Sunaquot?

42:07.391 --> 42:09.632
A lot of kids don't learn it these days.

42:09.827 --> 42:12.831
Well, I think they should.

42:14.798 --> 42:17.608
And why would that matter to you?

42:17.801 --> 42:20.407
We're reconnecting with our heritage.

42:22.907 --> 42:24.511
Really?

42:24.708 --> 42:26.881
Okay, what do you have in mind?

42:30.915 --> 42:38.231
"Motion, reverse, zone, V-cut, crease"
and "hit me I'm open"?

42:38.422 --> 42:42.461
The Unishees use Sunaquot on the field. I
think it could give the team a big advantage.

42:47.298 --> 42:50.677
Well, yes, Julie, I will have
dinner with you this evening.

42:53.003 --> 42:56.246
Joe, when you can ask me
in your native tongue...

42:56.440 --> 43:00.149
I'd be glad to help
for the sake of my students.

43:00.711 --> 43:03.487
Including the ones who just puked.

43:05.316 --> 43:08.695
<i>All this time I thought I was wasting</i>

43:08.886 --> 43:14.165
<i>But you've gone and saved me</i>
<i>And now I can breathe again</i>

43:14.358 --> 43:16.702
<i>You're bringing me back to life</i>

43:29.640 --> 43:32.644
You're supposed to meet with Dr. Gifford
today about your test.

43:32.843 --> 43:34.686
Why do you care?

43:34.878 --> 43:37.324
Because if you flunk out, you can't play.

43:44.054 --> 43:47.297
You know, Jimmy,
I'm trying to do something special here.

43:47.491 --> 43:49.994
Provide our people with a little hope.

43:52.062 --> 43:54.599
But to do that, I need to win games.

43:54.798 --> 43:57.301
And to do that, I need you.

44:01.238 --> 44:03.548
Why bother?

44:05.743 --> 44:08.314
To honor our people,
make lacrosse matter again.

44:09.313 --> 44:13.386
Look, together we can turn things
around here in a big way.

44:13.584 --> 44:16.793
But for that to happen,
I need you to be a leader, a team player.

44:17.521 --> 44:19.262
I need a captain, Jimmy.

44:19.456 --> 44:21.265
I'm already captain.

44:21.458 --> 44:23.165
Prove it.

44:26.230 --> 44:29.609
You can start by passing the ball.

44:35.139 --> 44:39.281
Hey. He was a ball hog at your age.

44:39.710 --> 44:41.849
Still a show boater.

45:04.768 --> 45:08.375
All right, guys.
I've translated the plays into Sunaquot.

45:08.572 --> 45:11.849
And like the Navajo code talkers
in World War Il...

45:12.843 --> 45:14.789
we'll confuse the
hell out of our enemies.

45:14.978 --> 45:16.958
You two help with pronunciation, please.

45:21.785 --> 45:22.923
Really?

45:23.120 --> 45:25.657
What you have here for V-cut, vagi...

45:25.856 --> 45:31.807
Actually kind of means like a woman's...
You know?

45:31.995 --> 45:33.770
- What?
- Let me see.

45:33.964 --> 45:35.534
Oh, my God, Joe, he's right.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.474
I got this from a very good source.

45:37.668 --> 45:41.241
Well, something got lost in translation,
like maybe tact.

45:43.674 --> 45:45.347
Just fix it, Sammy, okay?

46:43.433 --> 46:45.310
Hello?

46:52.075 --> 46:53.782
You must be Sasquatch.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.718
Maug.

46:55.913 --> 46:58.621
I'm Joe, the new coach.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.454
Hardly.

47:01.985 --> 47:05.831
I guess you've been watching.
Crooked Arrow says you can play.

47:06.990 --> 47:08.867
You can see that we could use
some help on defense.

47:09.059 --> 47:11.061
No, I'm busy.

47:13.430 --> 47:18.436
Well, you could help us win.
Be a part of the team.

47:18.635 --> 47:20.444
Feel the pride.

47:22.439 --> 47:24.180
Meet some girls.

47:27.744 --> 47:29.746
Hit rich boys as hard as you want?

47:35.052 --> 47:37.498
- Did I get it right?
- No. It's not a trapezoid.

47:37.688 --> 47:39.099
Yes, it is.

47:39.289 --> 47:44.864
Hi. Sorry to interrupt, but I'd like
to introduce you to your new classmate.

47:45.062 --> 47:48.066
This is Maug.

47:52.836 --> 47:55.248
I made him get dressed for class.

47:55.439 --> 47:57.112
Why?

47:57.307 --> 47:58.377
Well, welcome, Maug.

48:01.612 --> 48:03.353
He's amazing.

48:06.850 --> 48:11.959
Is it true you can catch a deer, kill
it with your bare hands and eat it raw?

48:17.127 --> 48:18.765
Chill, bro, I'm vegan.

48:24.034 --> 48:27.345
Crooked Arrows
showing some aggression, finally!

48:29.072 --> 48:32.019
Another turnover caused by Maug!

48:32.209 --> 48:34.587
This new guy is a hammer.

48:34.778 --> 48:36.314
Come on, guys, set it up! Let's run it.

48:36.513 --> 48:37.685
Come on, Jimmy.

48:37.881 --> 48:40.623
And the Crooked Arrows
are on offense again!

48:40.817 --> 48:41.818
Drop in, drop in.

48:51.094 --> 48:52.095
Find the pass.

48:52.296 --> 48:57.109
Jimmy Silverfoot sets it up.
Passes it to Sammy or is that Owen?

49:00.704 --> 49:04.652
Fakes low, fires high, and goal!
It's tie score late in the fourth.

49:04.841 --> 49:07.219
Watch the feet.

49:07.411 --> 49:11.052
Hey, hey, hey, act like we've been
here before, boys. Come on, let's go.

49:11.248 --> 49:14.491
Amazing improvement
since Joe Logan took over.

49:14.685 --> 49:15.857
Time out, sir, time out.

49:17.321 --> 49:21.201
Dooley is in a battle, and the Crooked
Arrows are on target for their first win.

49:22.526 --> 49:24.528
Toby, you're in.

49:24.728 --> 49:26.036
Me?

49:26.229 --> 49:27.401
Yes!

49:27.597 --> 49:29.543
Come on, just be aggressive, buddy.

49:31.635 --> 49:33.774
All right, guys, come on in. A minute left.

49:33.971 --> 49:37.180
Okay, Lyle, take a breather.
Toby, you're in at middie.

49:37.374 --> 49:38.876
- What?
- What?

49:40.110 --> 49:41.521
Sticks up.

49:41.712 --> 49:43.589
Come on, guys, it's tied.
We can win this.

49:43.780 --> 49:46.852
Come on, boys! Let's do this.
Crooked Arrows on three. One, two, three!

49:47.050 --> 49:49.155
Crooked Arrows!

49:54.057 --> 49:55.695
You're on wing, Toby.

49:55.892 --> 49:59.931
Toby, on the wing. On the wing.

50:00.130 --> 50:05.739
Now coming off the bench for the
Crooked Arrows, number 12, Toby Gifford.

50:13.143 --> 50:14.554
Watch the double team.

50:20.550 --> 50:22.791
Hey, here! Over here! Here!

50:22.986 --> 50:24.727
Look Toby! Look Toby! Look Toby!

50:27.391 --> 50:28.665
Come on, Toby.

50:31.661 --> 50:33.663
And he drops it.

50:42.639 --> 50:44.641
Come on!

50:45.409 --> 50:46.444
Hudson to Thomas.

50:46.643 --> 50:48.589
Reed, clear crease!
Clear crease, Reed!

50:49.980 --> 50:51.425
And it's in!

50:51.615 --> 50:56.587
Dooley pulls out a stunning victory
after a crushing Crooked Arrows turnover.

50:56.787 --> 50:58.630
What a game!

50:58.822 --> 51:02.599
The Arrows are still winless
for the season.

51:05.328 --> 51:07.035
How come their white boys can play?

51:07.230 --> 51:09.301
- Lay off, Jimmy.
- Why was he even out there?

51:09.499 --> 51:12.412
He's out there
because he's a member of this team.

51:17.407 --> 51:20.684
We win and lose together
and nobody played perfectly.

51:20.877 --> 51:25.223
But, hey, you guys played a great game, okay?
We'll get the next one.

51:25.916 --> 51:29.386
So tonight,
steak dinner on me, all right?

51:31.288 --> 51:32.995
I'm getting two steaks.

51:34.324 --> 51:37.669
- How about a lap dance?
- You don't have a lap, honey.

51:42.432 --> 51:45.208
- Thanks, Marilyn.
- You're welcome.

51:45.402 --> 51:49.680
The hawk feather has long been
a sign of service for our people.

51:49.873 --> 51:53.013
Warriors could earn feathers
on the field of battle.

51:53.210 --> 51:58.387
Soto Jimmy, for winning
three face-offs and notching two assists.

51:58.582 --> 52:02.052
To the Unishees, great speed, great effort.

52:02.252 --> 52:04.596
And one goal apiece.

52:04.788 --> 52:08.326
To Chewy, for tough position defense.

52:08.525 --> 52:12.063
And to Maug, for creating four turnovers.

52:12.262 --> 52:16.039
And to Nadie, for our motion offense.

52:16.233 --> 52:18.611
I plan to make this a tradition
after every game.

52:18.802 --> 52:21.681
So give ourselves a hand.

52:40.223 --> 52:41.759
Hey.

52:41.958 --> 52:44.336
Listen, I know you're in a tough spot here.

52:44.528 --> 52:45.734
I've been there.

52:45.929 --> 52:49.934
The only poor Sunaquot kid
at a fancy prep school.

52:51.234 --> 52:52.872
You didn't suck.

52:56.740 --> 52:58.845
You know how you get over it?

52:59.743 --> 53:01.381
Take the next shot you have.

53:01.578 --> 53:04.559
And I'll make sure
you get another chance, okay?

53:07.184 --> 53:08.857
Thanks, coach.

53:14.958 --> 53:16.733
Hey, Mom.

53:22.933 --> 53:26.107
Was that a little bit of Sunaquot
on the field today, coach?

53:27.470 --> 53:30.815
I told you, we're working cultural identity
into the game plan.

53:31.007 --> 53:35.513
A little bit of a loose translation,
don't you think?

53:35.712 --> 53:38.955
Yeah, well, kids kind of made it their own.

53:39.149 --> 53:45.259
Which is why I will be working some proper
Sunaquot into my lesson plan this week.

53:49.226 --> 53:50.864
See you later.

53:51.695 --> 53:53.140
Night.

54:09.312 --> 54:12.156
You have been given knowledge and tools.

54:12.349 --> 54:15.762
<i>But now, you must commit yourselves</i>
<i>to the Creator's game.</i>

54:16.686 --> 54:19.929
To the ancient game that began long ago...

54:20.123 --> 54:22.501
when the birds
first played against the animals.

54:27.530 --> 54:32.946
However, you must first accept who you are.

54:37.641 --> 54:41.111
<i>Within each one of us</i>
<i>resides an animal spirit.</i>

54:41.311 --> 54:46.590
<i>You must go on a vision quest</i>
<i>to discover your animal spirit.</i>

54:47.417 --> 54:52.264
Actually, sweating kind of makes me
break out, so can I...?

54:57.360 --> 55:02.400
<i>When the animals of the sky played the first
game against the animals of the land...</i>

55:02.599 --> 55:06.809
<i>the Creator gave a gift</i>
<i>to every creature.</i>

55:08.071 --> 55:09.607
Tell me your vision.

55:13.276 --> 55:14.721
The deer.

55:14.911 --> 55:19.018
A spirit of speed and agility.

55:21.251 --> 55:22.958
<i>Tell me your vision.</i>

55:25.722 --> 55:27.360
The bear.

55:27.557 --> 55:29.537
Great strength.

55:33.463 --> 55:35.170
The wolf.

55:36.232 --> 55:38.940
Became ferocious and wild.

55:39.402 --> 55:41.006
<i>The turtle</i>

55:41.971 --> 55:45.384
Was able to withstand any blow.

55:45.575 --> 55:47.350
The hawk.

55:48.645 --> 55:52.650
The birds were gifted
with flight and swift movement.

55:52.849 --> 55:54.658
<i>The raven.</i>

55:55.652 --> 55:58.132
<i>And even the smallest animal...</i>

55:58.955 --> 55:59.956
The squirrel.

56:00.156 --> 56:03.137
Would prove his worth to the Creator.

56:04.094 --> 56:09.066
This is good. In one team you represent
both the animals and the birds.

56:09.799 --> 56:13.611
It is said that our loved ones
return as birds to watch over us.

56:14.237 --> 56:19.653
So for you, Abooksigun, the eagle.

56:20.477 --> 56:23.754
May your mother's wings lift you up.

56:27.814 --> 56:30.124
All right, everybody, we're gonna
do a friendship dance now.

56:30.316 --> 56:31.795
So, ladies, grab a man.

56:50.670 --> 56:54.277
So things are looking up around here.
What do you think?

56:54.474 --> 56:56.954
Will we be ready to build
at the end of the season?

56:57.143 --> 56:59.145
That's yet to be seen.

57:02.248 --> 57:04.489
You don't answer to only me
in this quest, Joe.

57:06.052 --> 57:08.225
But to your ancestors.

57:08.955 --> 57:14.371
Grandma Skye tells me you come a long ways,
but there's more to your journey.

57:15.495 --> 57:17.805
Step up, step up, Reed!

57:17.997 --> 57:21.911
Poor goalie play has plagued them again
thanks to Reed "The Colander" Armstrong.

57:22.101 --> 57:24.809
I've never been very good
with nicknames.

57:25.004 --> 57:27.780
Anyway, along pass across the field.

57:29.075 --> 57:30.645
Hit him!

57:34.547 --> 57:35.651
Time out, sir.

57:35.848 --> 57:40.092
Marston Hall climbs within one, 14-13.

57:40.286 --> 57:42.527
Reed, come on, I've seen kittens
more aggressive than you.

57:42.722 --> 57:44.702
No, no, no, Joe, wait. Look.

57:45.858 --> 57:48.031
Reed, you better man up
and clear the freaking crease.

57:48.227 --> 57:51.003
Okay, you hold onto this
lead, or I swear...

57:51.197 --> 57:55.475
I will shove those feathers
so far up your asses, you'll fly.

57:55.668 --> 57:57.238
Okay, me first.

57:57.703 --> 57:59.205
- Sticks up.
- Come on, boys.

57:59.405 --> 58:04.013
I mean, I like your hair and your body is
tight, but you play goalie like a wussy.

58:04.210 --> 58:09.216
And that is so un-hot. We straight?

58:09.415 --> 58:10.826
Yeah, we're straight.

58:13.920 --> 58:15.695
Reed, buddy!

58:16.355 --> 58:17.663
I got this, coach, okay?

58:17.857 --> 58:18.927
All right.

58:20.359 --> 58:23.101
Ten seconds left,
Marston on a break, looking to tie.

58:23.296 --> 58:25.105
Baird breaks free, right wing.

58:25.298 --> 58:26.504
Watch the cutter!

58:27.633 --> 58:29.340
Too far! Too far, Reed!

58:32.238 --> 58:34.718
It's over! The Crooked Arrows win.

58:34.907 --> 58:35.908
Yes!

58:37.275 --> 58:39.653
The Crooked Arrows get their first win
of the season...

58:39.844 --> 58:42.222
with Reed coming out of the crease
to make the play.

58:45.583 --> 58:46.857
Now that's bringing it home, son.

58:47.051 --> 58:49.463
Just when you think you're not
getting through to these kids.

58:49.654 --> 58:53.625
Don't you take credit for that.
You didn't do that. Booty did that.

58:54.091 --> 58:56.833
What?

59:00.064 --> 59:03.068
<i>I get knocked down, but I get up again</i>
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

59:03.267 --> 59:04.803
<i>I get knocked down, but I get up again</i>

59:05.002 --> 59:06.879
Reed, for making 10 saves.

59:07.071 --> 59:09.813
<i>The Crooked Arrows are flying true</i>
<i>of late, hitting only bull's-eyes.</i>

59:10.007 --> 59:12.817
<i>Taking rematch wins against</i>
<i>St. Giles, Locke and Sulgrave.</i>

59:13.010 --> 59:16.287
Sweeping Dooley and blowing out
<i>the lowly Bernard Forest twice.</i>

59:16.480 --> 59:18.289
<i>They're flying out there.</i>

59:18.482 --> 59:22.487
<i>The fleet-footed Unishee brothers, Owen</i>
<i>and Sammy, must read each other's minds...</i>

59:22.687 --> 59:24.894
<i>their passes are so perfect.</i>

59:26.457 --> 59:31.202
<i>Two months ago, no one could have imagined Joe
Logan would take the lowest ranking team...</i>

59:31.395 --> 59:35.309
<i>in the New York Prep League</i>
<i>on a path towards the playoffs.</i>

59:35.499 --> 59:39.538
<i>I get knocked down, but I get up again</i>
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

59:39.737 --> 59:41.410
Another turnover.

59:41.606 --> 59:44.348
- Move like the wind! Run!
- Yeah, Chewy!

59:44.542 --> 59:47.546
And yes!

59:48.112 --> 59:49.989
Chewy, great steal.

59:51.015 --> 59:54.258
Another win for the Crooked Arrows.

59:54.452 --> 59:57.058
<i>Silverfoot scores!</i>

59:57.989 --> 59:59.798
The Arrows run a tight-motion offense.

59:59.991 --> 01:00:03.029
<i>This team is hot, and I don't
just mean their assistant coach.</i>

01:00:13.271 --> 01:00:17.310
<i>The Sunaquot team is moving up</i>
<i>the ranks at a breakneck pace.</i>

01:00:17.508 --> 01:00:23.390
<i>An unprecedented turnaround.</i>
<i>It's a Maug attack!</i>

01:00:24.248 --> 01:00:25.750
They weren't ready for that, were they?

01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:27.486
<i>Hello.</i>

01:00:30.488 --> 01:00:34.994
<i>After six straight wins, the Crooked</i>
<i>Arrows are getting state-wide attention.</i>

01:00:35.426 --> 01:00:40.535
<i>I get knocked down, but I get up again</i>
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>

01:00:45.703 --> 01:00:46.875
Yeah, good.

01:00:48.506 --> 01:00:49.951
No.

01:00:55.546 --> 01:00:57.048
<i>Joe Logan has his boys believing.</i>

01:00:57.248 --> 01:00:59.592
<i>They're passionate and driven,</i>
<i>but they'll have to ambush...</i>

01:00:59.784 --> 01:01:02.594
undefeated Coventry on the road
<i>in order to make the playoffs.</i>

01:01:02.787 --> 01:01:06.132
<i>And that's a very tall order,</i>
<i>even for Logan the Legend.</i>

01:01:14.165 --> 01:01:20.673
Two hundred thousand square feet,
500 rooms, 3000 slots, 150 tables.

01:01:20.871 --> 01:01:22.817
A 1000-seat performance theater...

01:01:23.007 --> 01:01:29.652
36-hole PGA golf course,
and the first Native Adventures theme park.

01:01:30.614 --> 01:01:35.927
Mr. Geyer, this is 10 times bigger
than what we discussed.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:41.468
Because with your plan,
your people merely survive.

01:01:41.659 --> 01:01:47.735
But with mine, they actually get rich.
You, chief among them.

01:01:47.932 --> 01:01:51.971
We're talking $100 million a year.

01:01:54.605 --> 01:01:59.213
This is not what I agreed to
with the council.

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:02.391
Once the money starts to flow,
they'll forget all about it.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:05.117
No, no, we had a deal. We had a deal.

01:02:05.316 --> 01:02:07.193
And I changed it.

01:02:09.053 --> 01:02:10.691
Trust me.

01:02:11.856 --> 01:02:15.099
You will be a hero to your people.

01:02:17.661 --> 01:02:18.935
Once we break ground tomorrow.

01:02:20.464 --> 01:02:21.636
Tomorrow?

01:02:22.066 --> 01:02:24.103
Day after Memorial Day.

01:02:28.672 --> 01:02:31.312
<i>Welcome to Coventry Academy</i>
<i>and The Bowl.</i>

01:02:31.509 --> 01:02:35.514
<i>This is the unquestioned seat</i>
<i>of prep lacrosse glory.</i>

01:02:35.713 --> 01:02:40.787
<i>No love lost today. The last time these two
teams met, Coventry annihilated the Sunaquot...</i>

01:02:40.985 --> 01:02:42.760
<i>and the game ended in a brawl.</i>

01:02:42.953 --> 01:02:45.263
A lot has changed since then
for the Crooked Arrows.

01:02:45.456 --> 01:02:48.232
But they still need a win if they're
going to make it to the postseason.

01:02:48.426 --> 01:02:52.499
And it's going to take a monumental effort
to overcome the storied men in blue.

01:02:52.696 --> 01:02:56.508
Gentlemen, you ever wonder why there's
no '98 championship banner here?

01:02:57.301 --> 01:03:02.011
Logan the Legend choked.
Let's make sure that happens again.

01:03:07.711 --> 01:03:09.918
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

01:03:10.114 --> 01:03:11.923
For getting blood on your only uniform.

01:03:12.283 --> 01:03:15.127
Down! Set!

01:03:17.521 --> 01:03:20.502
Watson wins the draw. Off to Dawes.

01:03:20.691 --> 01:03:23.365
And it looks like practice out there.

01:03:31.702 --> 01:03:34.706
Fancy stick work, a lot of hot-dogging.

01:03:34.905 --> 01:03:36.646
Coventry goes up one-zip.

01:03:36.841 --> 01:03:39.651
The high-flying Arrows
have quickly fallen back to earth.

01:03:39.844 --> 01:03:42.120
Hey, Arrows, how's that for stick work?

01:03:49.553 --> 01:03:51.590
Coventry seals up another
undefeated season...

01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:55.896
and enters the playoffs as the number
one seed with a dominant 12-5 victory.

01:03:56.093 --> 01:03:59.836
Coventry is stuffing the Arrows
back in the quiver.

01:04:01.065 --> 01:04:03.602
<i>They'll miss the playoffs again this year.</i>

01:04:07.638 --> 01:04:09.914
Yo, did you hear?
Marston lost and now we get a bye.

01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:13.088
Nice. Who we got here?

01:04:14.778 --> 01:04:18.988
You know, now that your season is over,
you can finally get with a winner.

01:04:19.183 --> 01:04:21.129
Marston lost?

01:04:22.887 --> 01:04:24.958
Marston lost!

01:04:26.123 --> 01:04:28.228
Guys, Bernard upset Marston.

01:04:28.792 --> 01:04:32.365
- Who cares?
- You do, we beat Bernard twice.

01:04:32.563 --> 01:04:35.100
That means we're in the playoffs.

01:04:37.401 --> 01:04:39.438
We're in the playoffs!

01:05:25.249 --> 01:05:26.387
What's up?

01:05:26.884 --> 01:05:28.363
Check this out.

01:05:30.588 --> 01:05:32.568
Coach, what's going on?

01:05:54.011 --> 01:05:55.718
How is this possible?

01:05:55.913 --> 01:05:57.392
Geyer needed a start date.

01:05:57.581 --> 01:06:00.619
The season ended today,
so I gave him one.

01:06:00.818 --> 01:06:02.491
But it didn't end today.

01:06:02.686 --> 01:06:06.224
What? You just thought we
wouldn't make it to the playoffs?

01:06:06.423 --> 01:06:08.801
No, not two months ago.

01:06:08.993 --> 01:06:10.631
Two months ago?

01:06:10.828 --> 01:06:14.139
The council was clear. I was clear.

01:06:14.331 --> 01:06:16.743
And you have not met
all my requirements, son.

01:06:16.934 --> 01:06:20.313
Look, this team couldn't win
a game before I took over.

01:06:20.504 --> 01:06:24.179
It's been a great season.
Pride has been restored, like you wanted.

01:06:24.375 --> 01:06:28.653
I've done everything that you've asked of me.
Why can't you just be happy for once?

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:40.129
The lacrosse field
was not part of the plan.

01:06:41.825 --> 01:06:45.170
I know, but the plan changed.

01:06:46.263 --> 01:06:47.264
And...

01:06:47.865 --> 01:06:50.778
we don't need a lacrosse field
for the rest of the season.

01:06:53.303 --> 01:06:57.774
Last-seeded teams don't play home games.
I can still coach, it's a win-win.

01:06:57.975 --> 01:07:01.184
For you, but what happened
to honoring our people?

01:07:02.413 --> 01:07:05.860
You're not our coach,
you're a liar and a hypocrite.

01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:08.523
Let's go.

01:07:12.523 --> 01:07:14.332
Nadie...

01:07:46.223 --> 01:07:51.297
Abooksigun led our team to a winning record
and reawakened our traditions within them.

01:07:51.495 --> 01:07:54.374
Our people were very inspired
by his efforts.

01:07:54.565 --> 01:07:57.307
Because we fear losing the casino
if we delay...

01:07:57.501 --> 01:08:01.415
we declare that Abooksigun
has fulfilled his obligation...

01:08:01.605 --> 01:08:04.415
and may proceed
using the new land he requested.

01:08:05.843 --> 01:08:08.687
That field is as old as our people.

01:08:11.615 --> 01:08:14.118
The return of his spirit
was to be decided by me.

01:08:14.318 --> 01:08:17.856
It was a difficult decision,
but the council has spoken.

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:32.805
I'm sorry that it happened this way, Dad.

01:08:33.002 --> 01:08:38.180
But it's time to move forward
and this is good for everybody.

01:08:38.841 --> 01:08:42.448
You are my son, and I love you.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:47.089
But the future of our people
rests in your hands.

01:08:47.283 --> 01:08:50.787
And I fear that your spirit
is not strong enough to protect us.

01:09:31.094 --> 01:09:37.375
Hey, Wampum, spot me a fortune feather,
will you? I'm down big here.

01:09:39.703 --> 01:09:41.705
Yeah? Me too.

01:10:24.948 --> 01:10:27.895
More troubles you than what I know.

01:10:29.953 --> 01:10:33.423
I think I may have feathered the arrow
for our enemy.

01:10:36.159 --> 01:10:38.469
Yet the eagle still flies.

01:10:39.663 --> 01:10:41.665
There is still time.

01:10:42.933 --> 01:10:49.145
But remember, a wise warrior forces his enemy
to fight at a time and place of his choosing.

01:11:05.355 --> 01:11:07.926
<i>Don't try to pin me down</i>

01:11:08.125 --> 01:11:10.935
I'm a contradiction

01:11:11.128 --> 01:11:13.039
Love, hate, get it straight

01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:15.676
<i>Half devil, half divine</i>

01:11:18.802 --> 01:11:20.042
What?

01:11:20.237 --> 01:11:21.545
I'm here to talk to you.

01:11:23.307 --> 01:11:25.218
Great, talk all you want.

01:11:25.409 --> 01:11:27.889
Believe

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:33.423
<i>I get what I want, not just what I...</i>

01:11:35.719 --> 01:11:38.825
You want to know howl lost
the state championship?

01:11:39.589 --> 01:11:41.728
See number 12? That's Emmitt...

01:11:41.925 --> 01:11:46.965
the current coach of Coventry,
and he's pointing at me, number 17.

01:11:47.164 --> 01:11:49.508
There were 15 seconds left and the call...

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:52.146
was for me to come off a screen,
work to the crease.

01:11:53.103 --> 01:11:55.083
I could have hit that shot in my sleep.

01:11:55.272 --> 01:12:01.621
But I was the guy who choked
and lost the championship.

01:12:08.051 --> 01:12:11.396
See? Everyone is devastated by my miss.

01:12:15.325 --> 01:12:19.330
But I'm just heading to the showers.

01:12:26.703 --> 01:12:28.842
You missed on purpose.

01:12:30.674 --> 01:12:32.551
I was tired of winning for them.

01:12:32.743 --> 01:12:34.950
Felt like I was being used.

01:12:35.746 --> 01:12:40.286
For three years,
Coventry cheered every score.

01:12:40.484 --> 01:12:43.954
They loved me
when I was helping them win...

01:12:44.154 --> 01:12:49.263
but the rest of the school day
I was invisible.

01:12:50.761 --> 01:12:53.367
Julie was the only one
who could see me for more...

01:12:53.563 --> 01:12:56.373
than just a poor kid
who could play lacrosse.

01:12:57.501 --> 01:13:01.244
And to her, the Sunaquot were more...

01:13:02.539 --> 01:13:06.282
than some Indians on a reservation,
you know?

01:13:07.244 --> 01:13:09.554
Losing wasn't the problem.

01:13:11.748 --> 01:13:13.921
I dishonored the game.

01:13:15.619 --> 01:13:18.896
And I've done it again.

01:13:20.357 --> 01:13:22.303
Okay, then fix it.

01:13:23.493 --> 01:13:25.200
Why do you think I'm here?

01:13:26.763 --> 01:13:29.607
Let me be your assistant, coach.

01:13:42.646 --> 01:13:44.853
Now coached
by young Nadie Logan and her father...

01:13:45.048 --> 01:13:48.188
the Crooked Arrows
take down Montross and win in round one.

01:13:48.385 --> 01:13:49.659
But where is Joey Hustle?

01:13:49.853 --> 01:13:53.300
<i>Shake it for the war chief all night long</i>

01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:55.299
Rattlebone

01:13:55.759 --> 01:13:57.432
Rattlebone

01:13:57.627 --> 01:14:01.074
<i>Sweet medicine</i>
<i>To each his own</i>

01:14:01.264 --> 01:14:05.371
Billy, hey, can I see that?
We've got a change.

01:14:05.569 --> 01:14:07.412
Mr. Geyer wants this done ASAP.

01:14:08.138 --> 01:14:09.640
Whatever, your money, boss.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.183
Yes, it is.

01:14:11.374 --> 01:14:13.581
One earth below

01:14:15.345 --> 01:14:17.484
One earth below

01:15:41.464 --> 01:15:42.807
Good job, Chewy!

01:15:42.999 --> 01:15:44.603
<i>Despite Joe Logan's absence...</i>

01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:48.146
<i>the Arrows are displaying</i>
<i>a vast arsenal of motion-offense plays...</i>

01:15:48.338 --> 01:15:50.784
<i>inspired by native box lacrosse.</i>

01:15:50.974 --> 01:15:54.353
Not to be denied a date with destiny,
the Crooked Arrows have ripped through...

01:15:54.544 --> 01:15:58.321
the best lacrosse teams in New York,
including the Dooley Devils.

01:15:58.815 --> 01:16:00.453
Can you believe it?

01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:04.257
The Sunaquot are heading to the state
finals and guess who they'll face.

01:16:04.454 --> 01:16:06.730
You know who,
they who shall not be named.

01:16:06.923 --> 01:16:08.732
Can the Arrows pull off one more miracle?

01:16:08.925 --> 01:16:11.701
Doubtful, but I for one sure do hope so.

01:16:12.062 --> 01:16:13.598
- Toby, get up here.
- Toby.

01:16:13.797 --> 01:16:16.505
- Get up here.
- Get water, man.

01:16:32.482 --> 01:16:34.428
Sprinkler systems are in order.

01:16:34.618 --> 01:16:36.757
We've got the same grass
they use at Yankee Stadium.

01:16:36.987 --> 01:16:40.560
- Oh.
- Wait, you know I can't stand the Yankees.

01:16:51.334 --> 01:16:53.837
Well done, Abooksigun.

01:16:54.037 --> 01:16:55.539
It's as it should be.

01:16:57.073 --> 01:16:58.609
We got our coach back.

01:17:09.819 --> 01:17:11.457
Hey, coach!

01:17:12.322 --> 01:17:14.529
Thanks, sis.

01:17:16.092 --> 01:17:18.072
All right, let's get to it.

01:17:18.261 --> 01:17:20.434
Let's go, boys, let's go.

01:17:22.866 --> 01:17:24.846
Louie, look over here.

01:17:25.035 --> 01:17:26.912
All right.

01:17:27.103 --> 01:17:28.946
We're gonna miss the game.

01:17:29.339 --> 01:17:31.683
Not if you two hurry up
and get the new name up.

01:17:31.875 --> 01:17:33.286
There you go.

01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:43.927
Welcome back to The Bowl on this
beautiful day for championship lacrosse.

01:17:44.321 --> 01:17:48.667
This title game features familiar foes
and a battle of tradition.

01:17:50.226 --> 01:17:53.867
The Sunaquot, representing the creators
of the ancient game.

01:17:54.064 --> 01:17:56.806
And Coventry Academy, the modern
juggernaut that has perfected it.

01:17:59.102 --> 01:18:02.845
Good afternoon, everyone, <i>on a beautiful
day here in upstate New York.</i>

01:18:03.273 --> 01:18:05.310
<i>I'm Sean McDonough,</i>
<i>delighted to have you with us.</i>

01:18:05.508 --> 01:18:09.615
<i>What brings ESPN to a state</i>
<i>high school lacrosse championship game?</i>

01:18:09.813 --> 01:18:14.023
<i>Well, America's fastest-growing sport</i>
<i>has spawned an amazing story...</i>

01:18:15.085 --> 01:18:17.861
<i>about a Native American team</i>
<i>called the Crooked Arrows.</i>

01:18:18.054 --> 01:18:20.227
<i>After a miserable 0-5
start to their season...</i>

01:18:20.423 --> 01:18:23.370
they changed coaches
<i>and brought in Joe Logan.</i>

01:18:24.627 --> 01:18:28.905
<i>These young men were on an unlikely winning
streak that lasted until the final day...</i>

01:18:29.099 --> 01:18:32.740
<i>of their regular season,</i>
<i>when they lost to undefeated Coventry.</i>

01:18:32.936 --> 01:18:36.145
<i>In a surprising twist of fate, the Arrows</i>
<i>have marched through the playoffs...</i>

01:18:36.339 --> 01:18:37.716
<i>to set up another meeting.</i>

01:18:37.907 --> 01:18:43.380
It's therefore no surprise that the lacrosse elite
have turned out to witness this epic showdown.

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:44.752
<i>Among those in attendance...</i>

01:18:44.948 --> 01:18:48.760
<i>professional lacrosse stars</i>
<i>Paul Rabil, Zack Greer and Brody Merrill.</i>

01:18:48.952 --> 01:18:52.024
<i>And at the end of the field,</i>
some of the sport's legendary coaches...

01:18:52.222 --> 01:18:56.364
<i>including John Desko of Syracuse</i>
<i>and Virginia's Dom Starga.</i>

01:18:56.559 --> 01:19:00.769
<i>Amidst all this excitement,</i>
<i>will Big Blue win another championship?</i>

01:19:00.964 --> 01:19:03.535
<i>Or is this the day David slays Goliath?</i>

01:19:04.667 --> 01:19:07.705
<i>Stay tuned, the game
starts in just a moment.</i>

01:19:09.906 --> 01:19:12.648
Hey, isn't that your boss?

01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:15.890
Hey, Joe!

01:19:16.079 --> 01:19:17.615
Mr. Geyer.

01:19:17.814 --> 01:19:19.794
Big game?

01:19:19.983 --> 01:19:22.589
Saw you made some unplanned renovations.

01:19:22.786 --> 01:19:28.395
But I was wondering why my crew
and my equipment are sitting idle.

01:19:28.591 --> 01:19:31.800
Well, you know when you asked if there
were any other ancient tribal traditions...

01:19:31.995 --> 01:19:34.805
- ...that might get in your way?
- Yes.

01:19:34.998 --> 01:19:37.376
Well, this game is one I forgot about...

01:19:37.834 --> 01:19:41.646
so we'll be keeping that land
for our lacrosse field.

01:19:41.838 --> 01:19:45.877
- Joe, we have a deal.
- No, we had a deal. You changed it.

01:19:46.075 --> 01:19:47.816
I just changed it back.

01:19:48.011 --> 01:19:52.050
There are a lot of other rich developers
out there looking for wasted land.

01:19:52.549 --> 01:19:54.756
I'll sue.

01:19:55.718 --> 01:19:57.129
In what court?

01:19:59.022 --> 01:20:01.002
We're a sovereign nation.

01:20:08.398 --> 01:20:10.742
Your laws don't apply on our land.

01:20:12.135 --> 01:20:14.376
I have a game to coach.

01:20:22.145 --> 01:20:24.523
One, two, three, Crooked Arrows!

01:20:25.949 --> 01:20:27.895
Hey, let them have the face-off.

01:20:28.084 --> 01:20:29.358
No way, I can take this punk.

01:20:29.552 --> 01:20:31.725
Silverfoot, trust me, okay?

01:20:31.921 --> 01:20:34.800
Face-off man is gonna clamp
and put it between his legs to the middie.

01:20:34.991 --> 01:20:38.495
Maug is gonna leave his man
and cover the other wing. Go!

01:20:45.735 --> 01:20:48.113
Arrows won't work
against body armor and machine guns.

01:20:48.304 --> 01:20:49.977
All it takes is one good shot.

01:20:50.173 --> 01:20:51.413
Down!

01:20:51.608 --> 01:20:53.087
Trust me, Jimmy.

01:20:53.276 --> 01:20:54.846
Set!

01:20:56.713 --> 01:21:00.286
Watson wins the opening draw,
a set play as he dishes and dashes.

01:21:02.719 --> 01:21:03.720
Yes, nice hit, Maug!

01:21:08.691 --> 01:21:10.534
Look at the point man, he's open!

01:21:15.198 --> 01:21:17.109
Sammy, nice finish!

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:20.713
The Crooked Arrows strike first,
quieting this capacity crowd in blue.

01:21:21.704 --> 01:21:24.446
When did the Indians
start playing lacrosse anyway?

01:21:27.877 --> 01:21:30.585
Way to start off the game.
Give me a second line, let's go!

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:33.590
Like I said, one good shot.

01:21:33.783 --> 01:21:36.161
I remember when I scored my first goal.

01:21:42.292 --> 01:21:43.737
Put a body on him, Chewy!

01:21:43.927 --> 01:21:46.464
Get in front of him, Chewy, come on!

01:21:53.236 --> 01:21:55.614
That's what I'm talking about.
Just like we drew it up, baby.

01:21:55.805 --> 01:21:57.341
Just like we drew it up.

01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:00.282
All right, guys, come on.
We'll get it back.

01:22:00.476 --> 01:22:04.788
And after getting punched
in the nose, the empire strikes back!

01:22:05.915 --> 01:22:10.261
Come on, take it away top side!
Who's hot? Slide! Slide!

01:22:13.489 --> 01:22:15.491
Two to one, we got them
right where we want them.

01:22:15.692 --> 01:22:18.138
Great shot by Watson. Two to one Coventry.

01:22:18.328 --> 01:22:20.808
And when they get a lead,
they rarely give it back.

01:22:22.131 --> 01:22:24.111
Slide!

01:22:24.534 --> 01:22:26.013
Goal!

01:22:29.739 --> 01:22:33.084
- Come on, guys, regroup! Regroup!
- Fast break!

01:22:37.747 --> 01:22:41.126
Coventry Academy
putting on a clinic here at The Bowl.

01:22:42.719 --> 01:22:46.166
It's just too much for the Arrows
on both ends of the field.

01:22:47.323 --> 01:22:49.360
No letup, blue line, no letup!

01:22:49.559 --> 01:22:51.539
Good hustle!

01:22:53.963 --> 01:22:55.943
No mercy!

01:23:00.069 --> 01:23:03.141
<i>It's getting contentious down on the field.</i>

01:23:03.339 --> 01:23:04.909
Get in the hole.

01:23:07.777 --> 01:23:09.051
Come on, way to be, way to be.

01:23:09.245 --> 01:23:10.815
And another turnover!

01:23:12.482 --> 01:23:14.155
Yes!

01:23:16.519 --> 01:23:19.022
Run Skada! Run Skada!

01:23:22.091 --> 01:23:24.970
And Dawes just got away with an
obvious hold and the Arrows come up short.

01:23:25.161 --> 01:23:27.767
- That's a hold, ref!
- Good no call, good no call.

01:23:27.964 --> 01:23:29.841
Come on, ref! What do you need?

01:23:30.033 --> 01:23:32.309
You're missing a good game!

01:23:32.702 --> 01:23:34.181
Come on!

01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:37.146
Nice job, way to not get caught.
Way not to get caught.

01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:39.377
Hey, that's a hold. That's a hold, ref!

01:23:39.575 --> 01:23:41.486
Quit your whining, 26.
You know whose field you're on!

01:23:41.678 --> 01:23:43.180
Hey, hey, hey!

01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:45.760
You gotta make that call.

01:23:46.549 --> 01:23:48.290
Down 7-4 at half.

01:23:48.484 --> 01:23:51.954
The Arrows are not going to get help from
anyone if they want back in this title game.

01:23:52.155 --> 01:23:56.934
Joe Logan is going to have to impart
more than just strategy during halftime.

01:23:58.961 --> 01:24:00.804
You know what you're gonna say?

01:24:00.997 --> 01:24:02.806
Not really.

01:24:04.767 --> 01:24:07.304
Okay, guys, great first half.

01:24:07.503 --> 01:24:08.880
Yeah? Check the scoreboard.

01:24:09.072 --> 01:24:11.245
- Tell that to the ref.
- Ref who?

01:24:11.441 --> 01:24:14.479
Hey, quiet. Hey, quiet!

01:24:17.547 --> 01:24:20.221
Yeah, I hear you.

01:24:20.416 --> 01:24:23.420
All right, yeah, they're bigger
than you, faster than you.

01:24:23.619 --> 01:24:27.328
And they have better facilities
and they have more championships.

01:24:27.523 --> 01:24:29.901
And, yes, they have a better
coach than you.

01:24:32.195 --> 01:24:37.235
But you know what?
None of that matters, okay?

01:24:37.433 --> 01:24:42.405
This game is not about them,
this game is not about us.

01:24:42.605 --> 01:24:45.017
And it's not about the scoreboard.

01:24:47.343 --> 01:24:50.790
In the ancient game,
they didn't keep score.

01:24:52.315 --> 01:24:56.457
They played to honor the Creator,
and so will we.

01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:01.158
We'll play to honor our ancestors
who were buried with their sticks.

01:25:06.295 --> 01:25:10.471
We will play to honor our grandchildren
who will be given sticks when they're born.

01:25:16.105 --> 01:25:19.450
This game has been in our blood
for a thousand years, gentlemen.

01:25:20.343 --> 01:25:26.123
Today, win or lose,
we return lacrosse to our people.

01:25:54.477 --> 01:25:55.649
Let's go, boys!

01:25:55.845 --> 01:25:59.816
Welcome back to The Bowl, where
the second half is about to get under way.

01:26:00.016 --> 01:26:01.586
We got this, man.

01:26:01.784 --> 01:26:03.388
Hey, no letups, we play four quarters.

01:26:03.586 --> 01:26:05.429
Hey, no letups, no letups.

01:26:09.525 --> 01:26:15.339
Wait a minute, wait a minute, there's some
kind of a commotion at the end of the field.

01:26:25.975 --> 01:26:32.187
It appears to be a large group of Native
Americans carrying some sort of tribal flags.

01:27:04.647 --> 01:27:07.457
Despite the sudden invasion,
the Coventry supporters...

01:27:07.650 --> 01:27:09.789
are making room
for these new lacrosse fans.

01:27:14.757 --> 01:27:17.363
This place has gone totally Native!

01:27:33.276 --> 01:27:34.846
Where'd they come from?

01:27:36.579 --> 01:27:38.422
Smoke signals.

01:27:39.148 --> 01:27:41.651
All the Haudenosaunee Nations
in one spot.

01:27:41.851 --> 01:27:44.422
I guess this is a home game now?

01:27:45.021 --> 01:27:46.591
Always was, son.

01:27:49.659 --> 01:27:51.332
Go get them.

01:27:53.863 --> 01:27:55.001
You ready to bleed again?

01:27:55.197 --> 01:27:58.201
This is our game.
You just picked up the sticks we made.

01:28:01.570 --> 01:28:04.107
Yes, thattaboy, Jimmy!
Finally got one.

01:28:04.307 --> 01:28:06.218
I'm open! Over here! Ball!

01:28:06.409 --> 01:28:08.355
He's open! He's open!

01:28:09.779 --> 01:28:10.780
Patience!

01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:15.087
Like predators, the Arrows are calmly
circling the Coventry goal.

01:28:17.019 --> 01:28:19.829
A pass too tall even for Maug.

01:28:20.823 --> 01:28:22.769
Save it, Jimmy, save it!

01:28:26.996 --> 01:28:29.101
Holy stick work!

01:28:30.933 --> 01:28:33.607
- All right, we have numbers. Push it!
- Hustle, hustle, get there, Dawes.

01:28:34.704 --> 01:28:36.706
We're a man down, we're a man down.

01:28:38.007 --> 01:28:39.384
Yes!

01:28:39.775 --> 01:28:41.152
Yeah!

01:28:42.511 --> 01:28:44.184
Yeah, get up, Twinkle Toes.

01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:46.121
Way not to give up on it, Jimmy!

01:28:46.816 --> 01:28:48.193
Good hustle.

01:28:53.356 --> 01:28:55.233
Look Sammy, look Sammy, look Sammy!

01:29:01.330 --> 01:29:02.331
Yeah.

01:29:10.373 --> 01:29:12.182
Oh, my God, you gotta be kidding me!

01:29:29.191 --> 01:29:30.568
Whatever the reason...

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:32.205
Well, done, Silverfoot! Well done!

01:29:32.395 --> 01:29:35.239
The Arrows are playing with
a renewed sense of purpose.

01:29:36.365 --> 01:29:38.777
Getting right back in the game.

01:29:40.336 --> 01:29:44.216
They don't have Coventry's depth,
but they simply will not quit.

01:29:47.410 --> 01:29:48.753
Reed!

01:29:52.715 --> 01:29:54.422
Chewy, that's it!

01:30:09.732 --> 01:30:12.406
Are you kidding me?
Get on the bench. Get on the bench!

01:30:12.601 --> 01:30:16.208
With their second-half surge,
the Arrows are right on Coventry's heels...

01:30:16.405 --> 01:30:18.043
but can they ever draw even?

01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:22.387
Now, Watson, now!

01:30:24.513 --> 01:30:27.551
- A rough, but perfectly legal hit.
- Yeah!

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:30.253
And number 10 Grayhouse is out of the game.

01:30:31.687 --> 01:30:34.463
Toby! You're in.

01:30:34.657 --> 01:30:37.763
All right, they're gonna double-team Jimmy
and lay off you, all right? Be ready.

01:30:38.761 --> 01:30:40.001
Oh, my God, Toby, Toby, Toby...

01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:42.199
Captain.

01:30:43.365 --> 01:30:44.605
Thank you.

01:30:49.171 --> 01:30:52.880
Two-six, get him, Silverfoot! Pick him up.

01:30:54.276 --> 01:30:56.415
Sticks up, off your hip!

01:30:57.246 --> 01:30:58.953
Move! You gotta rotate!

01:31:02.618 --> 01:31:05.724
Two-six, two-six!
Double, double, six, double!

01:31:06.355 --> 01:31:08.028
- Jimmy!
- Look Toby, look Toby!

01:31:08.224 --> 01:31:10.226
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

01:31:15.564 --> 01:31:16.736
Who's got him?

01:31:21.337 --> 01:31:22.338
Yes!

01:31:22.538 --> 01:31:26.350
Goal, point blank! Gifford with his first
of the season, first of his life.

01:31:26.542 --> 01:31:28.544
Tie score late in the fourth.

01:31:30.713 --> 01:31:32.624
Nice shot, Squirrel!

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:41.327
Give me that scout report.
He's not even on here, who is that kid?

01:31:41.524 --> 01:31:42.525
Yeah, Toby!

01:31:42.725 --> 01:31:44.500
Watson, get your carcass over here
right now.

01:31:44.693 --> 01:31:49.699
Joe Logan is coaching the game of his life
here, folks, and we're all tied up at 12.

01:31:49.899 --> 01:31:51.105
Have you forgotten who we are?

01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:54.804
Because they could care less and they're kicking
your privileged tails all over the field.

01:31:55.004 --> 01:31:57.211
Wake up and finish the job
or I'll find someone who will.

01:31:57.406 --> 01:32:00.148
On three, one two, three!

01:32:02.211 --> 01:32:04.350
You've worked your whole life for this.
Now is the time!

01:32:04.547 --> 01:32:07.187
You know who it's going to,
don't let 26 get the ball.

01:32:15.124 --> 01:32:18.469
Brutal illegal hit by Dawes
and that's a call they can't miss.

01:32:22.231 --> 01:32:26.373
He wasn't even in possession of the ball,
which makes it doubly egregious.

01:32:26.569 --> 01:32:29.880
What did I do? I barely touched him.
I didn't do nothing.

01:32:33.909 --> 01:32:36.082
The Arrows have been racked
by injuries today.

01:32:36.278 --> 01:32:40.954
This is a fatal blow if Jimmy Silverfoot
is sidelined, leaving the team a man short.

01:32:41.150 --> 01:32:44.597
Take it easy. Take it easy, Jimmy. Medic.

01:32:48.457 --> 01:32:51.063
You got us this far,
we'll do the rest, all right?

01:32:57.299 --> 01:32:58.573
I'm going in.

01:32:58.767 --> 01:33:01.611
What? No, you only have one good leg.

01:33:01.804 --> 01:33:04.614
Yeah, and no one else
has one good leg right now.

01:33:08.744 --> 01:33:10.746
What are you doing with that cheap shot?

01:33:10.946 --> 01:33:12.118
Deal with it and play the game.

01:33:12.314 --> 01:33:15.295
- Now we're a man down.
- So are they. They're putting in a girl.

01:33:15.484 --> 01:33:16.724
Turn around!

01:33:23.759 --> 01:33:27.070
Twenty seconds left, all right? Finish the
possession, we take it in overtime...

01:33:27.263 --> 01:33:30.039
- ...and seal the deal, all right?
- Remember, you're just a decoy, okay?

01:33:30.232 --> 01:33:31.267
Okay.

01:33:31.467 --> 01:33:34.175
Not okay. I'm finishing this.

01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:36.873
Why, because you're better than me
with a broken arm?

01:33:37.072 --> 01:33:39.143
It's just dislocated, I can still play.

01:33:39.341 --> 01:33:42.254
Not with a sling you can't.
Look, Jimmy, you can't...

01:33:42.444 --> 01:33:46.085
Her leg is my fault.
Last time I didn't go in, she got hurt.

01:33:46.282 --> 01:33:48.353
I can't let that happen again.

01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:53.090
If one of those guys hits that ankle,
she'll never play again.

01:33:54.023 --> 01:33:59.234
You got two years left, this is my last game.
Let me play, coach.

01:34:02.598 --> 01:34:07.707
Fine. But if you break your other arm,
I'm not helping you with your pajamas.

01:34:07.903 --> 01:34:11.180
I don't wear pajamas.

01:34:11.907 --> 01:34:17.050
Okay, guys, we're gonna run Z82.
Maug, move up to middie and set the pick.

01:34:17.246 --> 01:34:19.283
Toby, top of the crease
and screen the goalie.

01:34:19.481 --> 01:34:22.291
And Sammy, this is your shot, so hit it.

01:34:22.484 --> 01:34:24.589
- I always do.
- Okay, sticks up, guys.

01:34:24.787 --> 01:34:26.664
- Let's go, boys!
- Here we go!

01:34:26.855 --> 01:34:30.132
- Crooked Arrows on three, one, two, three.
- Crooked Arrows!

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:34.532
Hey, hey, hey! Wait.
You're just a decoy, okay?

01:34:34.730 --> 01:34:36.300
Okay.

01:34:36.498 --> 01:34:38.341
And here we go!

01:34:38.534 --> 01:34:43.005
The Crooked Arrows have a man advantage
with gutsy Jimmy Silverfoot at middie.

01:34:46.775 --> 01:34:52.453
V-2-6, 2-6, left shoulder,
left shoulder 2-6.

01:34:55.884 --> 01:34:57.454
Okay, okay, okay.

01:35:14.603 --> 01:35:15.775
Now, Maug, now!

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:21.052
- Here we go, here we go.
- Here we go, here we go.

01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:25.687
The Arrows work the ball around, looking
for an opening. Seconds ticking away.

01:35:26.548 --> 01:35:28.687
Jimmy!

01:35:30.052 --> 01:35:31.725
Ten seconds.

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:34.799
Oh, my God.

01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:36.526
Watch Sam my! Watch Sam my!

01:35:45.267 --> 01:35:47.440
And it's a loose ball!

01:35:56.145 --> 01:35:58.125
Shoot it!

01:35:59.548 --> 01:36:01.494
Shot! Shot!

01:36:22.571 --> 01:36:27.611
Unbelievable!
Sports Center, you've got your lead story!

01:36:27.810 --> 01:36:29.881
The Crooked Arrows are state champs!

01:36:39.955 --> 01:36:42.936
All right, all right! Come on, get up!
Get up.

01:36:43.125 --> 01:36:45.571
Get off. Get off.

01:36:46.495 --> 01:36:49.635
Coventry and Coach Emmitt
are taking the loss with great dignity.

01:36:54.403 --> 01:36:55.848
Silverfoot, you all right?

01:36:56.038 --> 01:36:57.642
Never been better.

01:36:59.741 --> 01:37:01.345
Nice shot, ball hog.

01:37:01.543 --> 01:37:03.545
What?

01:37:04.513 --> 01:37:05.821
- Hey, decoy.
- Hey.

01:37:09.218 --> 01:37:14.361
Hey, since I'm really hurt this time,
maybe I can get a kiss, coach.

01:37:19.127 --> 01:37:20.572
That's one good shot.

01:37:22.965 --> 01:37:25.639
- Thanks, good game.
- Good luck next year.

01:37:33.208 --> 01:37:34.619
Let's go, let's go!

01:37:34.810 --> 01:37:36.050
How about that?

01:37:37.779 --> 01:37:40.623
I have come to learn the stubborn ways
of my children.

01:37:40.816 --> 01:37:44.628
You, your time is coming.

01:37:46.788 --> 01:37:52.898
And you have found your spirit,
Abooksigun.

01:37:55.397 --> 01:37:56.876
It was you.

01:38:00.702 --> 01:38:02.010
Yo, Coach Joe!

01:38:02.871 --> 01:38:04.544
Here. You earned this.

01:38:23.725 --> 01:38:27.036
- Hey.
- Hey. So...

01:38:34.770 --> 01:38:36.340
Is that a yes?

01:38:36.538 --> 01:38:37.539
Come on.

01:39:03.432 --> 01:39:09.007
When the first game between
the animals ended, the Creator was pleased.

01:39:09.972 --> 01:39:13.943
<i>And he gave the Medicine Game</i>
to the people of the Haudenosaunee.

01:39:14.977 --> 01:39:20.825
That we may all come together
as one and heal each other.

01:39:53.015 --> 01:39:56.519
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>
<i>Check the highlight tape</i>

01:39:56.718 --> 01:39:59.892
<i>Put your beats with lyrics till I actuate</i>
<i>Grinding past the physical limits</i>

01:40:00.088 --> 01:40:02.967
<i>Of which I violate</i>
<i>My mental place is in the Garden State</i>

01:40:03.158 --> 01:40:06.196
<i>Spilling my body weight</i>
<i>Then hydrate until my pupils dilate</i>

01:40:06.395 --> 01:40:08.671
<i>I make you go for broke</i>
<i>Pulling out the only fund</i>

01:40:08.864 --> 01:40:10.969
<i>I don't blow my nose</i>
<i>Cleaner than a smoking gun</i>

01:40:11.166 --> 01:40:13.737
<i>My friends dope a ton</i>
<i>Stay above the choking lung</i>

01:40:13.935 --> 01:40:16.347
<i>Pushing up, hands stringing sticks</i>
<i>With a broken thumb</i>

01:40:16.538 --> 01:40:18.745
<i>I keep it casual</i>
Always check the manual

01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:21.443
<i>Always improvise</i>
<i>Already memorized the manual</i>

01:40:21.643 --> 01:40:23.554
<i>My gains are gradual</i>
<i>But always moving up</i>

01:40:23.745 --> 01:40:26.658
<i>Trading stocks with fake money</i>
<i>Learning how to chase the fast buck</i>

01:40:26.848 --> 01:40:29.055
<i>I'm a fast buck</i>
<i>You better match up</i>

01:40:29.251 --> 01:40:31.925
<i>Swim move, then I'm burning by you</i>
<i>Like a fat Dutch</i>

01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:36.569
<i>Paint the corners when I shoot with braces flow
Whipping my stick they said it was miracle</i>

01:40:36.758 --> 01:40:39.170
<i>I'm getting goosebumps</i>
<i>On me when I'm lyrical</i>

01:40:39.361 --> 01:40:41.739
<i>Killing beats one at a time</i>
<i>Like they were cereal</i>

01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:44.433
<i>I've moved around a lot</i>
<i>Lived on many different blocks</i>

01:40:44.633 --> 01:40:47.170
<i>From partners of the street</i>
<i>To waking up to smoking shots</i>

01:40:47.369 --> 01:40:49.246
<i>Well, I'm gonna stop it now</i>
<i>Check the flow</i>

01:40:49.438 --> 01:40:52.214
<i>I'm Coventry</i>
<i>Rapping with a couple Crooked Arrows</i>

01:41:03.819 --> 01:41:05.093
Let's wrap.

01:41:24.973 --> 01:41:29.683
<i>I've got to remember</i>

01:41:30.245 --> 01:41:34.352
<i>That all I need is right inside of me</i>

01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:40.465
<i>I look at this world around me</i>

01:41:40.722 --> 01:41:45.228
The tallest tree was once just a seed

01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:51.206
<i>Over and over, what I find</i>
<i>Is when I see it in my mind</i>

01:41:51.399 --> 01:41:56.280
<i>It's only just a matter of time</i>

01:41:56.471 --> 01:42:01.580
<i>Keep your eyes on winning</i>

01:42:02.110 --> 01:42:07.082
<i>'Cause if you try you'll never really lose</i>

01:42:07.282 --> 01:42:09.159
I'm John Desko and I'm a Crooked Arrow.

I'm Lars Tiffany and I'm a Crooked Arrow.

01:42:14.956 --> 01:42:16.401
- I'm a Crooked Arrow.
- I'm a Crooked Arrow.

01:42:16.591 --> 01:42:18.332
- I'm a Crooked Arrow.
- I'm a Crooked Arrow.

01:42:26.601 --> 01:42:28.581

01:42:28.770 --> 01:42:30.909

01:42:31.106 --> 01:42:33.552
<i>That you wake up</i>

01:42:33.742 --> 01:42:38.521

01:42:39.414 --> 01:42:44.454
<i>It's there for the taking</i>

01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:49.030
