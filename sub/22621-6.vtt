WEBVTT

00:13.600 --> 00:14.440
Come on, come on,
come on, we'’re gonna be late!

00:14.480 --> 00:15.656
Come on, we'’re gonna be late!

00:15.680 --> 00:17.096
Take it, take it, take the bag,
take the bag.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.296
Let'’s go, let's go, let'’s go!

00:18.320 --> 00:19.840
Come on, come on,
run to the car.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.600
Come on!

00:23.640 --> 00:26.520
Oh, God, come on.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.560
Oh, God, give me... give me...

00:32.600 --> 00:34.200
Stop it! Don'’t do that
to your brother!

00:34.240 --> 00:36.520
Give me the Bop It! Chill out!

00:43.040 --> 00:45.800
You're late. So I'm gonna
be late. Go find your book bag.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.840
Where'’s the baby's trousers
and other shoe?

00:49.880 --> 00:51.520
Okay, one shoe was all
I could manage...

00:52.360 --> 00:53.840
and he said
he doesn'’t like trousers.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.520
So when am I going to meet
this 'Debbie' woman then?

00:57.800 --> 00:59.800
Okay. It's not Debbie,
it'’s Debbie Louise.

00:59.840 --> 01:02.200
And she's not a woman,
she's my partner.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.320
What? She went from zero
to partner in three weeks?

01:05.560 --> 01:07.000
Didn't even have to climb
the charts.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.920
What is she, Ed Sheeran?

01:08.960 --> 01:10.440
Okay well you don'’t need
to meet her.

01:10.480 --> 01:13.760
Course I do. She'’s moved in.
She'’s living in your home,

01:13.800 --> 01:15.920
if my kids are gonna be using
the same bathroom as her

01:15.960 --> 01:17.360
then I want to meet her.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.920
- She could be a nutter.
- I don'’t go out with nutters.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.040
What are you
fucking talking about?

01:22.080 --> 01:23.480
Of course you do!

01:28.160 --> 01:29.320
- Hiya!
- Hiya.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.160
Morning.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.200
You got time for a coffee?

01:37.480 --> 01:39.600
No, sorry.
Couples counselling today.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.280
Oh, okay. Good luck with that.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.920
Oh, no, everything's fine.
It's just preventative.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.520
We're rock solid, Jill and I.
Although she disagrees.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.680
It... It'’s like physio or yoga,
we're...

01:52.000 --> 01:53.960
We'’re just doing it
to keep the marriage supple.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.120
Oi, Gonzalez. You got time
for a chat?

01:57.160 --> 01:59.320
No, no, no, no, I received
an official bollocking

01:59.360 --> 02:00.800
for lateness yesterday.

02:01.600 --> 02:02.600
Woah!

02:03.480 --> 02:04.560
Who's that?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.120
Don'’t touch the door.
It'’s automatic open,

02:08.160 --> 02:09.600
it opens on its own.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.016
Don'’t touch the door,
don'’t touch it.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.560
Holy shit, it's Anne.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.960
Why's she got all those kids?

02:14.240 --> 02:15.800
She's part of a Carpool now

02:15.840 --> 02:17.080
for school drops.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.200
Carpool? Carpool. Why don't
we have a carpool?

02:19.240 --> 02:21.880
- That would really help me!
- I live right there.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.680
If I spit now,
I'd hit my window.

02:23.720 --> 02:25.560
I don't drive.
My wife does the driving.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.400
I'm sans license.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.560
I thought you were late.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.960
Hey Anne! Nice big car.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.280
Yeah, we traded in the old one
for this flashy so and so.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.360
It's bit high-techno for me
but, um,

02:41.800 --> 02:43.216
I couldn't look at the Volvo
the same

02:43.240 --> 02:45.200
after I ran over the cat.

02:45.240 --> 02:48.320
But anyway, it means I get
to run a carpool now, so.

02:48.680 --> 02:51.120
Yeah. Uh, I would love
to talk to you

02:51.160 --> 02:52.416
- about that sometime...
- Hello Clare.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.480
Bloody hell, Anne, nice wheels.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.120
How many kids can you fit
in there?

02:56.400 --> 02:58.040
Safely? Um, nine.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.376
So you might have room
for a couple more

02:59.400 --> 03:00.800
- in the carpool?
- Uh, well...

03:01.840 --> 03:05.320
Oh, my God, you bought it?

03:06.320 --> 03:07.880
You look like
a drug dealer, Anne.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.760
It's actually
the top-rated people carrier

03:09.800 --> 03:11.440
- in Which? so...
- You're in my spot.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.840
- Oh.
- Joking. But you are.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.920
We should definitely,
definitely catch up soon,

03:17.960 --> 03:19.520
I'd love to hear more
about the carpool.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.440
- I like your hair.
- Ivy's desperate to see Darius.

03:22.480 --> 03:23.816
Do you guys want to come over
for a play date?

03:23.840 --> 03:25.600
We've just got a family pass
to Chessington.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.920
Yeah, I can't talk and drive!

03:41.480 --> 03:43.040
Amanda?

03:44.200 --> 03:45.560
Amanda? Aman...

03:47.640 --> 03:49.840
Amanda? Amanda!

03:51.840 --> 03:53.560
Don'’t think she saw me. Amanda!

03:57.080 --> 03:58.560
Don'’t think she could hear me.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.520
Look, if you'’re hungry
just go over and help yourself,

04:04.560 --> 04:06.080
no one will notice.

04:06.360 --> 04:09.040
Just kick the ball by their rug
and grab a handful of crisps.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.280
Right go, off you go. Hiya!

04:13.960 --> 04:16.520
Oh, you came. Pull up a pew.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.880
Or a jacket.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.200
- You can sit on my jacket.
- Oh, thanks.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.360
- Bubbles?
- Yep. Ah.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
Ah.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.760
Hey. There's Anne.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.040
So, what's, uh,
what's been going on?

04:35.280 --> 04:36.280
Nothing much.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.360
Apart from my ex, Lee,
having a new partner.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.560
- Uh-huh.
- Not girlfriend. Partner.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.080
Debbie Louise, for fuck sake.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.120
Who double barrels
two stupid names?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.160
Anyway, she's welcome to him.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.200
All we did was fight,
if I'’m honest.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.520
I stabbed him once.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.360
Just with a spork,
from a Tesco pasta salad.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.320
Just in the leg.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.520
Police got involved.
I got a caution for sporking.

05:08.640 --> 05:09.640
The wanker.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.840
I wish I could just stay angry
with him, but...

05:12.880 --> 05:14.960
he looks at me
with his stupid eyes and...

05:16.120 --> 05:19.240
I'm 20 again.
And I don't have two kids.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.640
And it's Saturday night...

05:23.000 --> 05:24.040
Julia?

05:25.400 --> 05:26.880
What the hell?

05:30.280 --> 05:32.520
Sorry, babe. Do you want to go
and get a coffee?

05:32.560 --> 05:33.560
Yeah, all right.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.000
We'd love to, Anne!

05:36.040 --> 05:37.760
Great! See you back at mine
in 20?

05:37.800 --> 05:39.160
Wicked!

05:48.800 --> 05:51.320
- Coffee's not too hot is it?
- No, no, it's perfect.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.720
- So true.
- Yeah, I made that.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.600
Yeah, I made all of them.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.056
I got terribly
into driftwood crafting

05:59.080 --> 06:00.120
after my early menopause.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.440
Well, what you lost in estrogen

06:03.480 --> 06:04.960
you definitely made up
for in hobbies.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.560
Oh, that'’s Clare again.
Carpool business.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.896
I'm terribly popular all
of a sudden.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.040
How annoying.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.176
I don't know Clare at all
but she's always struck me

06:18.200 --> 06:19.440
as a bit of a user.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.880
That might be unfair.
But I think it's true.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.680
- Turn your phone off.
- Yeah.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.680
Can I get you girls anything
to eat?

06:28.160 --> 06:29.280
Got a hobnob?

06:30.320 --> 06:31.776
I don'’t have any hobnobs
but I can get you some.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.816
- I just meant a biscuit or...
- Oh, I'll go to the corner shop.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.360
No, no, you don'’t need
to do that.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.176
It'’s fine, it's just two doors
down and one street across.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.360
It'’ll be two minutes,
five minutes, I'll take the car.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.040
Come on. You can get
in on it too.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.200
I live fucking opposite
the school.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.040
Oh, God, I'’m getting up,
my arse is numb.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.520
- What are you doing?
- Just having a nose.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.656
Trying to fill my eyes
with anything

07:03.680 --> 07:05.320
that isn't
a driftwood affirmation.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.840
Oh, God. That's creepy.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.816
Do you think there's others
in this range?

07:10.840 --> 07:12.320
What, like,
"You've scraped a pass"?

07:15.880 --> 07:17.920
Ah, I love these

07:17.960 --> 07:19.576
- What are you doing?
- I had one of these

07:19.600 --> 07:21.360
- when I was little.
- That was her dad.

07:21.720 --> 07:24.520
- Huh?
- That was her dead dad's face.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.520
- A dead dad?
- Yes!

07:26.800 --> 07:28.816
It was an impression
of his face. Like a death mask.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.496
Oh, what do you mean?
How do you know that?

07:30.520 --> 07:32.400
She'’s had it like that
since he died.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.680
Well, that'’s stupid.
What are we going to do, Liz?

07:34.880 --> 07:36.080
What are we gonna do?

07:36.120 --> 07:37.960
You've just replaced
her dead dad's face

07:38.000 --> 07:39.840
- with your fist.
- We got to fix it.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.296
- What are we gonna do, Liz?
- Just, like,

07:41.320 --> 07:42.960
put your face in it.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.680
I don't look anything
like her dead dad.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.440
You do a bit.
Sweep your hair back.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.400
And put some glasses on,
he was a specs wearer.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.960
No, I don't have my glasses
with me.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.320
Oh, I'’ve got some of Charlie's.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.440
Oh, God. Give them to me.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.600
You hold this. Oh, God!

08:09.080 --> 08:10.280
- What are you doing?
- Just...

08:10.800 --> 08:12.520
trying to get a better view
of your garden.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.040
- Oh.
- Is that a little cat grave?

08:16.280 --> 08:18.320
No. No. It's just
a raised flower bed.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.000
The foxes dug up the cat grave.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.000
- Hello, Kevin.
- Amanda!

08:41.920 --> 08:44.320
- Are... Are you lost?
- No, I was just passing.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.120
- Can I...? Yes.
- Of course.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.240
Oh, watch your clean shoes
on the dirty door mat.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.800
I wondered if you wouldn't mind
keeping quiet

08:56.840 --> 08:58.600
about seeing me
at Dr. Caltagirone's today.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.120
Oh, so you did see me then.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.400
Of course I saw you, Kevin,
you saw I saw you.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.480
Oh, right, yeah.

09:06.840 --> 09:07.840
But then, why...

09:08.840 --> 09:10.440
Oh, yes, of course. Yes.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.360
Yeah. It'’s just that I'm,
you know, uh,

09:13.600 --> 09:15.920
I don't know what the word is,
kind of high profile?

09:15.960 --> 09:17.680
Like, locally? Which is nuts,
of course,

09:17.720 --> 09:19.600
'cause I'’m actually
a private person,

09:19.640 --> 09:21.080
a very discreet person and...

09:22.440 --> 09:23.680
also the type of person

09:23.720 --> 09:25.360
that people have
an unhealthy interest in.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.480
You know, like...
Nigella or Sade.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.280
No, of course.
It'’s going no further...

09:31.320 --> 09:33.840
Johnny has huge jealousy issues.

09:34.800 --> 09:35.880
You know, on the one hand

09:36.200 --> 09:37.960
he loves having
an eye-catching wife

09:38.000 --> 09:40.240
but he cannot deal
with the attention I get.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.920
- Mm-hmm.
- And the problem is...

09:44.160 --> 09:46.240
I bring it, every day,

09:46.560 --> 09:47.856
I bring it.
I never let myself down.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.240
I always look my best.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.720
And Johnny, of course, is like,

09:51.760 --> 09:54.280
"Oh, who are you doing
that for?" And...

09:55.240 --> 09:56.560
I'’m like,

09:56.600 --> 09:57.960
"Well I'm doing it
for me."

09:58.160 --> 10:01.000
Hey, hey. Come on now.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.600
Um, Johnny's...

10:04.240 --> 10:06.400
- Johnny is a very lucky guy.
- Yeah.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.320
And every marriage has
its issues.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.760
I... I just found out
in counselling

10:12.040 --> 10:14.600
that my wife finds me
less sexually attractive,

10:14.640 --> 10:17.720
since I become a house husband,
she thinks I'm emasculated...

10:17.760 --> 10:19.376
Kevin, I can't take on your shit
right now.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.320
No, yes. Sorry. Of course.
Sorry.

10:23.720 --> 10:24.720
Well...

10:25.680 --> 10:27.480
you can talk to me anytime.

10:28.320 --> 10:32.120
My door is always open
and my mouth is always closed.

10:38.720 --> 10:39.976
I'’m sorry,
I don'’t feel comfortable

10:40.000 --> 10:41.240
with you touching me like that.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.040
Said my wife.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.200
Did Charlie leave his scooter
here?

10:58.440 --> 11:00.320
- He doesn't have a scooter.
- Yeah, he does.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.480
He found one in the park.
So he has a scooter.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.440
- Well it's not here.
- Shit.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.520
I bet someone's nicked it.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.320
Where's Debbie Does Dallas?

11:11.720 --> 11:13.920
It'’s Debbie Louise.
And she's at work.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.640
- Where'’s all the kids' stuff?
- What?

11:15.680 --> 11:17.800
Where's all the toys and mess
and kiddy crap?

11:18.600 --> 11:20.280
I don't know, in their rooms?

11:20.320 --> 11:21.560
What's with all the cushions?

11:22.120 --> 11:24.400
- I like cushions.
- Since fucking when?

11:24.440 --> 11:26.560
You can't get angry
at cushions, Liz.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.976
You know, you can't have
strong feelings

11:28.000 --> 11:29.296
against something
that'’s designed

11:29.320 --> 11:30.696
to make your back feel
more comfortable.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.000
How is that not broken?

11:32.280 --> 11:34.120
How can Charlie play in here
with that?

11:34.520 --> 11:35.760
- He just...
- What's this shit?

11:36.280 --> 11:38.560
- I don't know.
- It's potpourri.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.680
There'’s just bowls
of potpour-fucking-ri

11:41.720 --> 11:44.080
everywhere! She's turning
her house into a nursing home.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.640
Yeah well. It's my house.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.640
She can'’t just erase
all evidence of our kids.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.560
I want to meet this woman.
You set something up or I...

11:53.920 --> 11:54.920
I swear, I'll...

12:00.280 --> 12:01.720
What's wrong with potpourri?

12:01.760 --> 12:03.080
I rather like potpourri.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.040
It's not the potpourri.
It's the principal

12:05.080 --> 12:06.760
behind the potpourri.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.880
What, you don't agree
with perfumed bark?

12:08.920 --> 12:12.560
No, it... Look, I don't want
my kids brought up around it.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.440
Oh, there'’s Anne! Anne, hi.
Come and sit down.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.600
Oh, there'’s no chair.
I'’ll get you a stool.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.160
I wouldn't write off
all potpourri,

12:22.200 --> 12:25.080
there's some lovely blends,
especially at Christmas.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.320
Oh, there's Amanda. Can we put
a pin in this for a min?

12:42.080 --> 12:43.480
What's going on with you two?

12:43.720 --> 12:45.200
Oh, I'm just helping Amanda

12:45.240 --> 12:46.680
work through something
at the moment.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.960
- Since when?
- It's private. I can't.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.400
You know what, I need a drink.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.760
Let's go to the pub tonight,
get pissed

12:58.800 --> 13:00.440
and forget about everything
for a minute.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.440
Oh, no, you two go ahead.
Now I'm burnt out by eight.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.960
I can't even make it
to Holby City.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.760
I don'’t do anything
evening-based.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.256
What, you never go out
in the evening?

13:08.280 --> 13:10.920
Yeah, I do. I just... I don'’t do
mum stuff in the evening.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.600
- "Mum stuff?"
- No, I just meant... Oh, you...

13:14.200 --> 13:15.320
You know what I meant.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.000
Anne, hi.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.920
Aw. Hi, Anne.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.680
Off to meet Liz, then!
Won'’t be a late one.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.440
Hi, Amanda.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
Yes, I can talk.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.640
You all right, Amanda? I c...

13:37.680 --> 13:39.160
I can't really make out
what you're...

13:40.880 --> 13:42.760
Are you crying or laughing?
I can't...

13:45.440 --> 13:46.560
I'm coming over.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.560
- Uh, you can sit down, Kevin.
- No, I'm fine standing.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.480
It's like Churchill
with the queen.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.216
You haven't said anything
to Anne, have you?

13:57.240 --> 14:00.680
- Oh, no, God no. Jesus, no.
- Okay.

14:03.480 --> 14:04.840
I'm just feeling a bit...

14:06.760 --> 14:10.400
it's just that Johnny's on
one of his rampages.

14:11.240 --> 14:15.000
His jealousy,
it just flares up sometimes.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.280
Well, look...

14:17.320 --> 14:19.280
we all have our little blips
in our marriages...

14:19.320 --> 14:20.976
Ever since the thing with Bobby
he's been like this.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.120
Well, as I said,

14:23.080 --> 14:24.600
marriages are very, um...

14:26.480 --> 14:27.680
Sorry, who... who's Bobby?

14:31.400 --> 14:32.480
Well, he...

14:33.960 --> 14:35.976
I feel like I can trust you
with this information, Kevin.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.360
Of... Of course.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.360
Johnny wanted to take control
of his jealousy.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.600
The thing is he's
very complicated.

14:45.800 --> 14:49.160
He's horribly jealous
but at the same time

14:49.200 --> 14:50.880
he enjoys watching me
with another man.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.480
- Of course. W... what?
- So,

14:53.840 --> 14:56.680
Bobby is someone we invited
into our relationship.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.360
On a monthly basis.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.240
He'’s a squaddie. He drives up
from Aldershot.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.840
And that'’s all I know about him.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.360
Hmm.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.000
Aldershot.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.800
My... My mum lives in Fleet,
which is very near Aldershot.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.160
Tip for that neck of the woods,
um,

15:25.920 --> 15:29.320
the great tandoori, um...
Second to Naan.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.680
- Oh, God.
- It'’s fine. It's fine, Kevin.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.216
- I'm so sorry. Let me just...
- It'’s fine, don't worry.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.160
- Just leave it, it'’s f... Kevin.
- Uh,

15:37.640 --> 15:40.160
uh, you know, um, look,
look, look.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.640
Many... Many couples have, um...

15:44.120 --> 15:47.600
I... I think... Who am I? Um,
I mean, you look at, um,

15:47.920 --> 15:51.520
many... many marriages,
many couples,

15:52.200 --> 15:56.000
Oh, uh, I mean the conventional,

15:56.040 --> 15:58.480
I mean, who... who hasn't, um...

16:00.080 --> 16:02.160
wha... what is a marriage?
What is...

16:02.200 --> 16:04.080
What is normal?
There isn'’t any... Ow, ow...

16:04.120 --> 16:05.520
there isn'’t any normal...

16:05.800 --> 16:06.840
Oh, my God.

16:08.680 --> 16:09.880
- That's Johnny. Uh...
- Oh.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.296
Kevin, would you mind
just stepping into the garden?

16:12.320 --> 16:14.056
- What? Surely there's no need...
- Just, no, no, no.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.600
It's totally fine but just
would you...

16:16.680 --> 16:17.360
If just step into the garden,
it'’ll be so much easier for me.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.400
- Oh, oh, okay.
- Yeah.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.000
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.400
How come you'’re back so early?

16:30.440 --> 16:32.840
Really? I do live here,
you know.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.040
Is it such a bad thing for me
to come home?

16:35.080 --> 16:37.080
- Johnny what'’s wrong?
- We'’re out of beers.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.440
Well, I come home,

16:38.800 --> 16:41.280
you'’re not pleased to see me,
there'’s no kiss,

16:41.320 --> 16:43.096
- what about normal couples?
- What are you talking about?

16:43.120 --> 16:44.616
I just said, "How come you'’re
back so early?"

16:44.640 --> 16:46.016
That'’s all I did, what's wrong
with you?

16:46.040 --> 16:47.640
I can'’t keep doing this,

16:47.680 --> 16:49.416
- I'’m exhausted!
- Oh, you can'’t keep doing this,

16:49.440 --> 16:51.136
- you'’re exhausted.
- What is wrong with you?

16:51.160 --> 16:52.680
I'’m going outside
for a cigarette.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.640
- What?
- I'’m having...

16:54.680 --> 16:56.120
- What?
- A cigarette.

16:56.840 --> 16:57.960
Johnny why are you smoking?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.336
I'’m smoking
because from the moment

16:59.360 --> 17:00.560
I walk in the door,

17:01.680 --> 17:03.136
- you'’re busting my balls.
- Oh, please.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.760
Do we have a lighter
in this house?

17:05.120 --> 17:08.400
Fifteen thousand candles
and not one lighter!

17:47.440 --> 17:48.960
Let me get the first round in.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.760
Oh, no, no, no. Let me get them.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.280
Okay. Um, I'll have a Cava.
And then I'll get the next one.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.640
Oh, well, let's see how we feel.
I mean,

17:58.360 --> 17:59.960
we may find
that we're fully quenched

18:00.200 --> 18:02.080
- after this one.
- Okay. I'’ll just get a seat.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.920
Liz!

18:03.960 --> 18:05.496
Thought you didn't do mum stuff
at night.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.760
No, no, this is, um...

18:07.720 --> 18:09.640
this is strictly
carpool business.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.520
Kev. Over here.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.240
- I bought you a drink.
- Okay.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.600
Um, yes please, another.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.560
- You all right, Kevin?
- Hmm?

18:32.600 --> 18:34.200
What happened to your jeans?

18:37.520 --> 18:38.720
Oh, I was just climbing.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.880
Clare's in the house.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.280
Oh, the gang's all here.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.160
Oh, God, I love Cava.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.440
It's a terrific alternative.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.160
I actually think it's nicer
than champagne.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.520
So do I. I love it.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.680
Yeah, I don't like to drink Cava
around my husband though.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.440
He had to cut it out.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.296
He hasn't had a drop
since our son's christening.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.240
Which is difficult,

19:10.280 --> 19:12.440
because he really loved Cava.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.960
And his...
His father loved Cava also.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.360
His father would drink two
to three bottles of Cava a day

19:18.400 --> 19:21.160
at his worst. Which was sad
but, um,

19:21.640 --> 19:23.640
it also meant he was very easy
to buy presents for.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.560
- Do you like Cava, Liz?
- No.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.800
- Jesus Christ!
- What's going on?

19:48.760 --> 19:50.400
- Nothing's going on.
- Yes, there is.

19:50.680 --> 19:51.680
What's going on, Kevin?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.400
I'm just dealing
with some very personal stuff

19:55.440 --> 19:57.160
right now, that isn't even
my personal stuff

19:57.200 --> 19:58.400
and it's just...

19:59.280 --> 20:01.056
it's too complicated, Liz,
I can't talk about it.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.760
Oh, great, I'’ll just be ignored
by you and Julia then.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.600
I'm in here.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.680
Last orders!

20:11.720 --> 20:14.480
Right, I'd better make a move.
I've had such a fun evening,

20:14.520 --> 20:15.936
can we just have a chat
about carpool...

20:15.960 --> 20:17.560
All back to mine
for the after party.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.760
- I'm afraid I can't.
- I can't either.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.680
I can, actually.
I meant I'm afraid I can.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.000
- Liz?
- No, thank you.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Right.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.120
Oi!

20:44.560 --> 20:46.120
Have you found the scooter?

20:48.440 --> 20:49.760
Okay, let'’s get
some tunes going.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.760
Shh, hey, my husband's got
an early shift, okay?

21:03.800 --> 21:06.360
But, um, let's get
this after party started, okay.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.200
I can just stay for one, Anne.
Anne? I'’m just staying for one.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.720
Oh, this is my worst nightmare
come true.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.160
Surrounded by mums at night.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.920
I can just about handle it
on the school drop but this.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
- Amanda?
- Hi.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.120
I'’m sorry,
I'm in my dressing gown

21:32.640 --> 21:34.600
Well, we're on the phone
so it doesn't really...

21:34.880 --> 21:36.400
Have you got time for a chat?

21:38.000 --> 21:39.960
Well, I'm at a little party
at Anne's,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.360
- it's a bit...
- What?

21:42.800 --> 21:44.320
Anne didn't mention a party.

21:44.360 --> 21:45.920
Oh, well that's
because it's just

21:45.960 --> 21:47.600
a little impromptu after party.

21:48.280 --> 21:50.080
Anne is having an after party?

21:51.400 --> 21:52.400
Pâté?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.560
I made it myself,
it'’s so simple.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.800
Just whizz up a liver,
any old liver

21:57.840 --> 21:59.240
and then throw in a dash
of tabasco.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.600
Now, where'’s that Cava?

22:03.360 --> 22:05.000
I think I have a nice one up
behind Daddy.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.400
This one, no!

22:27.840 --> 22:29.920
My phone was off,
so I must have missed your call

22:29.960 --> 22:31.120
that you were having a party.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.640
Yeah, well, it's...
It's an after party.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.136
And the whole deal
with an after party

22:36.160 --> 22:38.080
is that you had to have been
at the party before.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.240
But you mustn'’t have heard
your phone when I called.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.200
Sorry about that, Anne.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.160
For fuck's sake.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.920
You left your jacket
in my kitchen,

23:20.960 --> 23:23.960
and Johnny found it
and he has completely lost it.

23:24.880 --> 23:25.880
What?

23:27.440 --> 23:29.520
How... How did he know it was
my jacket?

23:31.240 --> 23:32.800
Your name is stitched
in it, Kevin.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.480
- Shit.
- Yeah.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.640
Shit, shit, shit.

23:43.680 --> 23:44.680
Shit!

23:45.880 --> 23:47.960
Well, what a great night.
Thanks, Anne.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.200
God, I just really needed
to switch off from...

23:52.560 --> 23:55.760
work and kids and school
and carpools,

23:55.800 --> 23:58.520
any decision on the carpool?
Would just really help me out.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.840
Oh, God, yeah. Sorry.
I gave the spot to Clare.

24:02.160 --> 24:02.960
What?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.136
Yeah, I gave the spot to Clare.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.920
That's... That's why we were out
for a drink.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.520
Oh, right. It's just,
that's also why I was out

24:08.560 --> 24:11.640
- for a drink.
- Oh, I thought... I mean...

24:11.960 --> 24:14.120
I thought you just wanted
to go out for the fun of it.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.640
Oh, come on, Anne, I was very,
very specifically there

24:16.880 --> 24:19.160
to talk about carpool.
And do you know what's more,

24:19.200 --> 24:21.280
you knew that, Anne, so you've
actually just been

24:21.560 --> 24:25.880
stringing me along.
You're a real uh, carpool tease.

24:25.920 --> 24:29.000
Oh, God, not cool, Anne.
Not cool at all.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.440
Cheers, Anne.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.080
- That was rude.
- What?

24:38.120 --> 24:39.720
I'm no fan of Anne, but come on.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.800
- Yeah, well I'm tired.
- No, no. You're on the make

24:41.960 --> 24:43.240
the whole time Julia.

24:43.480 --> 24:44.816
The only reason
you're here tonight

24:44.840 --> 24:46.880
- is 'cause you wanted something.
- No.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.816
- Well, yeah but that's not...
- Are we even friends?

24:48.840 --> 24:50.320
- What?
- Are we friends?

24:50.360 --> 24:53.200
Of course we'’re friends.
I see you every day!

24:53.240 --> 24:55.600
I see more of you than I see
some of my bridesmaids.

24:55.640 --> 24:57.416
Yeah but you never ask me
to do anything with you.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.720
- That's not true.
- I'm your day friend Julia,

24:59.760 --> 25:01.680
not an evening friend.
I'm a "mum" friend,

25:01.720 --> 25:03.040
I'’m a convenience.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.336
You know, I asked you to come
for a drink tonight,

25:05.360 --> 25:07.016
'cause I needed to talk
with a fucking mate,

25:07.040 --> 25:08.680
and instead you chose
to hang out

25:08.720 --> 25:10.280
with an emotional storm drain.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.320
- I'm an emotional storm drain?
- No.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.680
- Shit.
- Does anyone like me?

25:17.960 --> 25:21.560
Yes, people like you,
I like you. Liz...

25:22.320 --> 25:24.560
- Amanda likes you.
- Amanda doesn't like me,

25:24.960 --> 25:26.520
she doesn't give a flying poo
about me.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.080
She just wants people around her
who can kiss her arse,

25:29.360 --> 25:30.640
and I've kissed
every square inch

25:30.880 --> 25:31.920
of that flat arse.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.680
Anne, you're drunk

25:35.720 --> 25:37.120
and you're embarrassing
yourself.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.440
If I were you I'd take myself
to bed and sleep it off.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.480
I may be drunk,

25:47.440 --> 25:48.896
but at least I know how
to unclench my flipping bumhole

25:48.920 --> 25:51.000
- and have a good time.
- Did you just push me?

25:51.760 --> 25:53.960
- No.
- How dare you!

25:54.000 --> 25:55.280
Okay, let'’s not get violent.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.480
After everything I'’ve done
for you, Anne.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.440
Amanda is having threesomes
with a squaddie.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.920
Right, well I can't top that,
so I'm off.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.840
Thanks for a great evening,
Anne.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.480
Do you want to share a taxi or.
