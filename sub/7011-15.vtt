00:09.409 --> 00:12.242
- Oh!
- Oh! That's 16 for me and Hyde...

00:12.312 --> 00:15.179
and four for the losers!

00:15.248 --> 00:18.479
You guys ought to get a mascot...
a big, green, furry loser!

00:19.686 --> 00:23.679
That's...
That's not even a thing.

00:23.757 --> 00:27.887
Come on. Take it to the hoop. Or maybe you're
afraid, 'cause you know I'm gonna slap it down.

00:27.961 --> 00:31.488
Oh, yeah?
Well... Yeah?

00:31.564 --> 00:33.828
You tell her, Eric!

00:35.068 --> 00:37.059
Ooh!

00:38.772 --> 00:41.707
Oh! How can he stand
the embarrassment?

00:43.309 --> 00:46.244
She told you what she was gonna do.
You gotta listen, man.

00:49.349 --> 00:53.308
Eric, why don't you just give me the two
points? Save yourself the humiliation.

00:53.386 --> 00:57.083
Well, why don't you just save yourself
the two points, and then the humiliation...

00:57.157 --> 00:59.148
will... be...

01:00.560 --> 01:02.528
J... Whatever! Come on!

01:02.595 --> 01:05.462
Oh, I'm comin', and there's nothin'
you can do to stop me.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.065
Eric!

01:16.242 --> 01:19.143
Oh, my God!
Donna's wearing granny panties!

01:19.212 --> 01:21.612
Nice panties, Granny!

01:24.451 --> 01:28.717
Oh, come on. You have to admit,
that was some killer "D."

01:29.789 --> 01:31.950
Oh, no.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

02:10.029 --> 02:13.521
Okay, Fez, I got you some
Valentine conversation hearts.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.160
Oh, thank you, Caroline.

02:18.671 --> 02:20.901
"Be mine." Okay.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.912
"Sweetheart." It really is.

02:28.615 --> 02:32.142
"Kiss me."
Well, I'm not about to argue with candy.

02:34.187 --> 02:38.521
<i>Fez, is there one in there that says,</i>
<i>"Get a room"?</i>

02:39.826 --> 02:44.388
No, but here's one that says,
"Kiss my brown ass."

02:47.100 --> 02:49.660
Sorry you had to hear that,
Caroline.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.671
It's okay.
She asked for it.

02:52.739 --> 02:55.537
Ooh, I gotta get going.

02:55.608 --> 02:58.202
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.337
Well, well, well.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.906
Look who has a lady.

03:06.486 --> 03:09.353
And to think, I was about to settle for you.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.856
Talk about dodging a bullet.

03:16.829 --> 03:18.820
Hey, hey.

03:18.898 --> 03:21.196
Check out this article in <i>Boys' Life.</i>

03:21.267 --> 03:23.565
"The Square Knot:
Not Just For Squares"?

03:23.636 --> 03:26.901
No, this one,
about being an astronaut.

03:26.973 --> 03:29.840
I think I'm gonna do that.

03:29.909 --> 03:32.901
Michael, I think there's a prerequisite
for being an astronaut.

03:32.979 --> 03:35.140
You have to be not dumb.

03:36.449 --> 03:38.781
Uh-uh.

03:38.851 --> 03:42.412
If they can send a monkey into space,
they can send me.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.923
I don't know.
Monkeys are pretty smart.

03:45.992 --> 03:48.153
All right.
Fine, fine. Make fun.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.356
But when you see my shoe prints on the moon,
what are you gonna say then?

03:51.431 --> 03:54.867
Probably, "Hey, some monkey's
wearing Kelso's shoes!"

03:55.969 --> 03:57.960
Hey, hey, astro-chimp.

03:58.037 --> 04:00.938
When you come back down to Earth,
if your parachute doesn't work...

04:01.007 --> 04:04.067
you could always use
Donna's monstrous panties.

04:04.143 --> 04:08.079
Hey, hey, hey, you guys.
None of that when Donna gets here, okay?

04:08.147 --> 04:10.581
I don't need her mad at me
on Valentine's Day.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.709
All right, Forman, relax.

04:12.785 --> 04:15.310
Wearing granny panties
is a very sensitive issue...

04:15.388 --> 04:18.824
that I don't find funny,
and I refuse to exploit.

04:18.891 --> 04:20.983
Good.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.564
Hey, everybody, look.
It's Granny Panties!

04:25.632 --> 04:27.998
- Hyde!
- Wha... Oh, sorry, man.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.194
It's in my nature to burn.

04:30.270 --> 04:34.331
Granny Panties understands.
Don't you, Granny Panties?

04:34.407 --> 04:39.003
Okay, look. I didn't have anything
else to wear. It was laundry day.

04:39.078 --> 04:42.275
I didn't know they made a washing machine
big enough for those panties.

04:42.348 --> 04:46.478
Hey! Hey, you guys can
all just shut up, okay?

04:46.552 --> 04:50.010
So she wears big panties.
So what?

04:50.089 --> 04:55.527
Donna, look, I am...
really, really, really sorry.

04:55.595 --> 04:58.291
Eric, I'm fine.
Let's just forget about it.

04:58.364 --> 05:03.734
Really? 'Cause when I saw your sweats
around your ankles, I thought I was dead.

05:03.803 --> 05:07.398
- Eric, I said, I'm fine.
- Oh, my God.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.806
Oh, my God.
You are so cool.

05:10.877 --> 05:15.473
- You... I... You are seriously, like, the coolest girl ever.
- Wow.

05:15.548 --> 05:18.142
Chicks must really dig astronauts,
'cause it says here...

05:18.217 --> 05:20.777
that astronauts get
all the Tang they want.

05:29.762 --> 05:32.959
Oh, Donna is gonna love
you making dinner for her.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.967
There's nothing sexier
than a man who cooks.

05:36.035 --> 05:39.766
Unless that man is Burt Reynolds.
Then I don't give a darn what he's doing.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.205
He's just sexy!

05:45.945 --> 05:48.937
Ooh-hoo, Mom has a thing for the Bandit.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.382
Ten-four.
Go set the table.

05:54.987 --> 05:57.285
Oh, no, no, honey,
use the special china.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.758
You don't want to mess up a good thing
with everyday dishes.

06:00.827 --> 06:04.263
Okay, but, Mom, it's not like
I <i>can</i> mess this up.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.764
I mean, Donna is cool
no matter what I do.

06:06.833 --> 06:10.291
Like, earlier, I pulled down her pants
in front of everyone in the driveway...

06:10.370 --> 06:13.430
- and she just stood there...
- You did what?

06:13.506 --> 06:17.465
No, it was cool.
She just... She said she was fine.

06:20.980 --> 06:26.008
- Oh. Then I guess she's fine.
- Yeah, 'cause she said she was fine.

06:26.085 --> 06:30.021
Yeah, she wouldn't say she was fine
unless she was fine. Would she?

06:30.089 --> 06:33.889
- What are you talking about?
- What do you think I'm talking about?

06:33.960 --> 06:36.292
I don't know.
Why are you doing this to me?

06:36.362 --> 06:38.830
- Doing what?
- I don't know!

06:38.898 --> 06:43.392
- Well, all I meant was, have a happy Valentine's Day.
- Oh.

06:45.638 --> 06:47.697
Oh, okay. Thanks.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.404
Although I doubt you will.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.469
Stop it!

06:59.886 --> 07:01.877
Hello, Michael.

07:01.954 --> 07:05.082
Hi, Mrs. Forman. Is Laurie home?
I got a little surprise for her.

07:05.158 --> 07:10.926
Oh, you brought her flowers.
Isn't that just... a waste of money.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.988
No...

07:13.065 --> 07:15.090
she deserves them.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.433
I mean, not many people get me, you know?
I'm a complicated guy.

07:18.504 --> 07:20.768
So when everyone
starts in on me...

07:20.840 --> 07:24.071
I just like to be with my girlfriend,
'cause she's nice to me.

07:26.245 --> 07:29.772
- Who are we talking about?
- Laurie.

07:29.849 --> 07:33.546
- Laurie Forman?
- Yeah, so I just want to tell her...

07:33.619 --> 07:37.715
that I'm happy we're together on this,
our nation's day of love.

07:37.790 --> 07:42.227
Oh, well, how patriotic of you, Michael.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.890
Yeah.
I wanna be an astronaut.

07:48.568 --> 07:53.335
Oh. Well, I...
I think you'd make a fine spaceman.

07:54.340 --> 07:57.207
Thanks.

07:59.579 --> 08:04.778
You know, I gotta say, I think Laurie gets
a lot of her sweetness from you.

08:05.952 --> 08:07.943
Laurie Forman?

08:17.230 --> 08:19.221
Bye, Laurie.

08:19.298 --> 08:22.358
Hey, man, what the hell
are you doing?

08:22.435 --> 08:24.835
What? Oh, yeah.

08:24.904 --> 08:28.396
I should, uh, probably go out
through the window.

08:39.418 --> 08:42.477
Oh, would you look at this?

08:42.554 --> 08:45.547
Ooh, a nice, romantic dinner for two.
Donna's gonna love it.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.150
Why, is she bringing a date?

08:48.227 --> 08:52.561
- Red!
- I'm sorry, but that's funny.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.829
- Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Forman.
- Oh, my.

08:57.904 --> 09:01.670
Look at this vision of lovely.

09:01.741 --> 09:06.678
Oh, this is just like when you two were little,
and you... you used to eat pretend supper.

09:06.746 --> 09:11.740
Only now it won't end up with
Donna sitting on Eric's head.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.545
Oh.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.685
Oh, Red, let's go.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.526
- Kitty, that was just awful.
- I know. Keep walking.

09:26.365 --> 09:29.198
Wow, I was... afraid that
was gonna be awkward.

09:29.268 --> 09:33.034
Yeah.
Eric, this looks so great.

09:33.105 --> 09:36.541
Yep. Shaked, baked and maked
especially for you.

09:36.609 --> 09:41.512
And this here is a little somethin'
I like to call... "a little somethin'."

09:41.581 --> 09:44.277
You got me a present?
That's so sweet.

09:44.350 --> 09:48.878
I didn't get you anything,
and you got me... panties?

09:48.955 --> 09:50.946
What the hell?

09:51.023 --> 09:53.992
Yeah, panties!

09:56.195 --> 09:58.186
- Get it?
- No.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.357
To replace your ugly ones.

10:00.433 --> 10:04.597
Eric, when I said I didn't get it,
I meant I didn't like it.

10:06.038 --> 10:08.666
No, see,
you forgave me earlier...

10:08.741 --> 10:14.543
and... I figured if I brought it up,
we could just, you know, share a laugh.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.645
Your turn.

10:21.721 --> 10:24.747
You know what?
You're the one who doesn't get it.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.591
- Well, maybe you should explain it to me.
- <i>I heard that!</i>

10:36.035 --> 10:38.435
This is the worst
Valentine's Day ever.

10:42.508 --> 10:45.238
It's Donna's fault. Okay?

10:45.311 --> 10:47.541
I didn't make her wear
that big, goofy underwear.

10:47.613 --> 10:50.104
I'm sorry, but if you're
hanging out with this crowd...

10:50.182 --> 10:52.912
you gotta know that eventually
your pants are gettin' pulled down.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.476
Am I right?

10:55.554 --> 10:59.513
I am so glad I did not pull down
Caroline's pants.

10:59.592 --> 11:02.425
I mean, if she asked me to,
I would...

11:02.495 --> 11:04.656
because I respect her wishes.

11:06.565 --> 11:08.726
And, also, I am so horny.

11:10.169 --> 11:14.299
Forman, when I told you it'd
be funny to give Donna panties...

11:14.373 --> 11:17.342
I meant it'd be funny to me.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.401
And it was.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.913
This is what happened
to my heart...

11:22.982 --> 11:25.576
when I found out Laurie
was cheating on me.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.682
It's lemon.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.562
I mean, how could she do this?

11:37.630 --> 11:39.564
I really thought
we had somethin'.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.365
Probably the same way
you did it to Jackie.

11:43.436 --> 11:46.303
Only this time it's even funnier,
'cause it's you.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.466
This is a good day.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.945
Tonight, I am going to ask Caroline
to go steady with me...

11:54.013 --> 11:58.074
because that is the last step
before you can do it, right?

11:58.150 --> 12:00.482
Oh, how I want to do it.

12:03.355 --> 12:06.449
I am so horny.

12:06.525 --> 12:11.087
So Michael cheated on me with Laurie,
and Laurie cheated on him.

12:11.163 --> 12:15.190
Hmm! There is a God,
and he's on my side.

12:15.267 --> 12:18.532
Well, I'm glad you're happy.
My boyfriend's a giant baby.

12:18.604 --> 12:22.335
"Ooh, underwear is so funny.
Poo-poo, pee-pee, caca."

12:24.543 --> 12:26.875
You know what'll
make you feel better?

12:26.946 --> 12:29.278
Let's go make mean jokes
at Michael's expense.

12:29.348 --> 12:31.543
How will that
make me feel better?

12:31.617 --> 12:34.984
'Cause then I'll feel better,
and I can cheer you up.

12:35.054 --> 12:39.457
On what planet did Eric think it was okay
to pull down my pants?

12:39.525 --> 12:44.861
There are some things that are private, Jackie...
for instance, everything under my pants.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.660
I agree.
Keep it to yourself.

12:47.733 --> 12:51.999
Why doesn't Eric understand that when I said,
"I'm fine," I meant, I will <i>be</i> fine...

12:52.071 --> 12:57.509
so long as he kisses my ass
for two weeks until I'm actually fine?

12:57.576 --> 12:59.806
He's, like, brain damaged.

12:59.879 --> 13:03.940
Look, he's just not
a good boyfriend.

13:04.016 --> 13:08.578
You should dump him, and then we
can move to Dallas and be weathergirls.

13:11.724 --> 13:14.989
- So, how was your night?
- He blew it.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.298
Well, what a surprise.

13:20.366 --> 13:23.733
- Wait, you're saying that like it's <i>not</i> a surprise.
- Okay then.

13:26.305 --> 13:31.140
You know, Son,
there's a time and a place...

13:31.210 --> 13:33.701
to pull down a lady's pants.

13:35.381 --> 13:39.374
And a pickup game in our driveway
is not one of 'em.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.612
Look, Dad,
I know it was dumb...

13:41.687 --> 13:46.647
but Donna said it was fine,
and... apparently it wasn't fine.

13:46.725 --> 13:51.924
Sit down. Eric...

13:51.997 --> 13:55.228
there's a pair of shoes up
in your mom's closet.

13:55.301 --> 13:58.862
And one day, I accidently stepped on
one of them and scuffed it.

13:58.938 --> 14:02.533
"Don't worry," your mom said.
"Everything's fine."

14:02.608 --> 14:06.009
But every now and then,
she takes them out of the closet...

14:06.078 --> 14:09.047
and she puts them on,
and she does this.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.007
"Ohh."

14:14.620 --> 14:17.919
Then she takes them off
and puts them back in her closet.

14:19.058 --> 14:23.017
Eric, this has been going on
for 14 years.

14:24.763 --> 14:27.391
So why doesn't she
just get new shoes?

14:29.668 --> 14:31.659
Oh, Eric...

14:31.737 --> 14:34.501
you are so young.

14:34.573 --> 14:36.871
You see, women are...

14:36.942 --> 14:40.275
What's the word I'm looking for here?
Crazy.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.974
Oh. So, overall,
you and Mom are okay.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.519
So Donna and me,
we'll be okay, right?

14:48.587 --> 14:52.717
No.
I scuffed your mom's shoe.

14:52.791 --> 14:56.750
I didn't pull her pants down
in front of God and the foreign kid.

14:56.829 --> 14:59.730
So, what are you saying?
I'm screwed with Donna?

14:59.798 --> 15:03.564
Hey, if it makes you
feel any better...

15:03.636 --> 15:06.805
I'm surprised you lasted
this long.

15:24.022 --> 15:27.389
- I like popcorn. Do you like popcorn?
- Yes.

15:27.458 --> 15:32.157
- I like candy. Do you like candy?
- Yes.

15:32.230 --> 15:35.290
I like soda. Would you like
to go steady with me?

15:35.366 --> 15:38.927
- Oh, yes, Fez!
- I think I might have tricked you.

15:40.405 --> 15:42.737
You do know we <i>are</i>
going steady, right?

15:42.807 --> 15:45.332
Yes!

15:45.410 --> 15:48.675
- What a magical night.
- Yes.

15:48.746 --> 15:51.408
I dreamed of this
since the moment we met.

15:51.482 --> 15:53.643
Me too.

15:56.387 --> 16:01.120
You know, this is my favorite movie of
all time. I've seen it, like, 16 times.

16:01.192 --> 16:05.390
That woman keeps calling Clint Eastwood
and asking him to play "Misty" for her.

16:05.463 --> 16:07.454
Isn't it romantic?

16:10.768 --> 16:15.705
Romantic? But she is following him
and bothering him and threatening him.

16:15.773 --> 16:19.971
Yeah, that's what I mean.
If she can't have him, nobody can.

16:23.014 --> 16:25.278
Okay then.

16:25.350 --> 16:29.116
Oh, you're so cute.
I love being your girlfriend.

16:29.187 --> 16:32.918
If you ever left me, I'd kill you.

16:45.270 --> 16:47.465
O... Okay then.

16:52.310 --> 16:54.471
What's up with
Eric's head anyway?

16:54.545 --> 16:58.675
It's completely out of proportion
to that skinny body.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.911
He looks like a Blow Pop.

17:05.156 --> 17:09.616
You know, I bet Michael's gonna
want me to feel sorry for him.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.560
But I'm gonna be all, like...

17:12.630 --> 17:16.656
"Aww. Bite it, Casanova!"

17:18.803 --> 17:23.035
- Hey, Jackie, Donna.
- Hey, Michael. I heard what happened.

17:23.107 --> 17:28.511
- Yeah. Me and Laurie are done.
- Doesn't Eric look like a Blow Pop?

17:28.579 --> 17:32.106
- Uh, yeah, I guess.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

17:32.183 --> 17:36.882
Uh, listen, uh, Jackie,
can we go somewhere and talk?

17:36.955 --> 17:41.392
No! Look, anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of Donna.

17:44.462 --> 17:46.930
Well, okay.

17:46.998 --> 17:49.694
Uh, listen...

17:49.767 --> 17:52.600
what happened with me
and Laurie got me thinking.

17:52.670 --> 17:56.572
And what she did
was really a betrayal...

17:56.641 --> 17:59.303
and it hurt so much.

17:59.377 --> 18:02.574
So you want me
to feel sorry for you.

18:02.647 --> 18:06.139
- No, don't feel sorry for me.
- Wait, what?

18:06.217 --> 18:09.152
No, I deserve this.
After what I did to you?

18:09.220 --> 18:13.054
I don't know if you've made the connection,
but there are a lot of similarities...

18:13.124 --> 18:17.185
between what Laurie did to me
and what I did to you.

18:17.261 --> 18:21.027
Except... you and I
were really in love...

18:22.033 --> 18:24.024
and you trusted me.

18:25.403 --> 18:28.702
Jackie, I let you down,
and I'm sorry.

18:28.773 --> 18:34.507
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you just saying
this stuff so I'll give you Valentine sex?

18:36.114 --> 18:38.480
'Cause this is a holy day,
Michael...

18:38.549 --> 18:41.177
and you should be
ashamed of yourself.

18:41.252 --> 18:43.447
No.

18:43.521 --> 18:46.979
I just said what
I wanted to say, and...

18:47.058 --> 18:50.494
I don't blame you if you never
want to speak to me again.

18:51.496 --> 18:54.294
That's it. Good-bye.

19:00.605 --> 19:02.596
Jackie, are you okay?

19:03.674 --> 19:06.905
Sure. Great.

19:06.978 --> 19:11.938
I'm just... sitting here alone
on Valentine's Day.

19:12.016 --> 19:16.385
- Hey, I'm here.
- Yeah, why are you here?

19:16.454 --> 19:18.581
You should be with
the one you love.

19:18.656 --> 19:20.681
And you love Eric...

19:20.758 --> 19:23.488
for some reason.

19:23.561 --> 19:26.724
Shut up.
There's a lot of reasons.

19:27.732 --> 19:30.599
He's not a Blow Pop.

19:30.668 --> 19:32.659
He's a sweetie pie.

19:34.305 --> 19:36.535
Then you should be with him.

19:36.607 --> 19:41.169
Look, take it from someone
who has loved and lost.

19:41.245 --> 19:46.182
Whatever he did isn't worth
being alone on this holiest of days.

19:47.819 --> 19:51.380
Jackie, are you actually thinking
about me instead of yourself?

19:53.324 --> 19:56.225
Yeah! God, I've had
<i>way</i> too much sugar!

20:01.299 --> 20:03.893
Look, Eric, we need to talk.

20:03.968 --> 20:06.493
Before, I told you everything was fine
when it wasn't.

20:06.571 --> 20:11.565
So, I'm sorry for not letting you know what
a colossally insensitive bonehead you are.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.836
Oh, apology accepted.

20:17.415 --> 20:21.010
That's... very big of you.

20:21.085 --> 20:23.076
No, I'm serious.

20:23.154 --> 20:25.486
So from now on
when you piss me off...

20:25.556 --> 20:29.322
I will do you the courtesy
of blowing up in your face.

20:29.393 --> 20:33.022
Oh, Donna, that's all I ask.

20:33.097 --> 20:36.828
And as for my part, I've realized that
somewhere along the way we crossed a line...

20:36.901 --> 20:41.133
where... pulling down your pants in public
is really no longer that funny.

20:41.205 --> 20:43.435
And I suppose
that point came when...

20:43.508 --> 20:48.445
- you started letting me pull them down in private.
- Exactly.

20:48.513 --> 20:51.311
So...

20:51.382 --> 20:53.373
are we good?

20:54.652 --> 20:56.643
Yeah. No.

20:57.688 --> 21:00.748
- Are we good now?
- Gettin' there.

21:06.330 --> 21:09.163
- Just... Come on. Let me put my pants on.
- Nope.

21:09.233 --> 21:13.636
But... it's really cold.
And...

21:13.704 --> 21:17.663
You know, I'm freezing off parts of my body
that I know you've expressed appreciation for.

21:22.079 --> 21:25.845
Eric, for God's sakes,
no one wants to see that.

21:28.052 --> 21:30.111
Yeah, now we're good.

21:55.980 --> 21:58.608
Ohh.

21:58.683 --> 22:01.982
- Something wrong, honey?
- No.

22:02.053 --> 22:04.544
Everything's fine.
