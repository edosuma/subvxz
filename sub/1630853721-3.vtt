00:17.600 --> 00:19.019
<i>Umbrella.</i>

00:20.228 --> 00:25.316
<i>A company besieged by legal scandal</i>
<i>and falling stock prices</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:28.778
<i>is now trying to reinvent itself</i>
<i>with a major push</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:31.072
<i>into direct-to-consumer drugs.</i>

00:31.906 --> 00:35.952
<i>Critics say that the company's operating</i>
<i>at a dangerous burn rate,</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:38.288
<i>but Umbrella's betting big on the move.</i>

00:38.371 --> 00:42.834
<i>Brainchild of newly minted CEO,</i>
<i>Evelyn Marcus.</i>

00:43.918 --> 00:45.420
Tell me about Joy.

00:45.503 --> 00:50.633
Well, they say you can't put a price
on happiness, but sure you can.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.552
-If you bottle it.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.220
You sound like your father.

00:54.304 --> 00:58.058
He founded Umbrella
before being… pushed out.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.185
He did.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.104
And I still like to think of this
as a family business.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.899
Still, I have
to ask you about the past.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.567
Raccoon City.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.905
It was an unimaginable tragedy.

01:11.988 --> 01:15.200
A horrible accident
that no one could have seen coming.

01:15.283 --> 01:16.367
Don't get me wrong.

01:16.451 --> 01:20.622
The old Umbrella, my father,
made his share of mistakes,

01:20.705 --> 01:22.665
but this is not that company.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.752
The things
we're working on today…

01:27.295 --> 01:29.214
they're gonna change the world.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.207
Those are rubber bullets, right?

02:21.850 --> 02:22.851
Help!

02:24.018 --> 02:25.520
Help!

02:26.146 --> 02:27.355
Mom?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.155
Come on.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.616
-Over here.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.310
Sir, we lost her.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.354
So, you find her.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.064
Chase down the runners.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.775
I want a team along the outer docks,
another in the trees.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.579
Dude. Ouch.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.799
-No!
-Don't shoot!

03:36.883 --> 03:38.259
-Don't shoot!
-Mom?

03:38.801 --> 03:39.802
Mom!

03:39.886 --> 03:41.679
Liam, come here.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.520
I'm sorry.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.273
We thought he was gone. We…

03:53.358 --> 03:55.068
I don't know how to thank you.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.115
Billie.

04:19.926 --> 04:20.927
Billie?

04:21.010 --> 04:22.011
Go away.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.055
No! We have to talk.

04:25.223 --> 04:29.185
I just wanna know
you're all right. Billie.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.318
Oh, you're home. Great.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.362
I'm starving. What's for dinner?

04:39.445 --> 04:41.030
What?

04:42.156 --> 04:43.449
How's your sister?

04:43.533 --> 04:44.450
She's…

04:45.410 --> 04:46.452
good.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.413
Catching up on school, I think.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.998
When she's done…

04:51.791 --> 04:53.835
-tell her I'll be right back.
-Yes, sir.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.348
Billie, come on.

05:08.766 --> 05:09.976
It's fine.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.355
I'm fine.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.809
-Who the hell sent that drone?

05:51.893 --> 05:53.227
Umbrella.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.479
"Umbrella"?

05:54.562 --> 05:57.482
-They wouldn't.
-Oh, they really would.

05:57.565 --> 06:00.026
You have a family.
You should've taken the ferry.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.364
We can't.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.367
Why not?

06:20.671 --> 06:22.048
You're smuggling contraband.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.175
Forty-year-old contraband.

06:24.258 --> 06:27.428
The Black market on these
will keep us alive while we resettle.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.472
We've got people in Calais.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.516
My sister, her girls.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.102
He's been through so much.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.396
We just want
to raise him amongst family.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.482
Give him something that feels… normal.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.486
There's gotta be another way across.

06:44.445 --> 06:45.488
There is.

06:45.988 --> 06:46.948
The "chunnel."

06:47.490 --> 06:49.575
Traffickers run people through
to the other side,

06:49.659 --> 06:50.952
and they don't ask questions.

06:51.035 --> 06:54.956
-It's too dangerous.
-And if we stay here? What, then?

06:56.165 --> 06:57.875
We spent most of our money on the boat.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.547
Okay, so we pull what we've got,
and we go together.

07:02.630 --> 07:05.216
No offense, but why should we trust you?

07:05.299 --> 07:06.342
She saved Liam.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.471
Look, the only way you can trust anyone
is when they need you.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.641
And right now, we need each other.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.420
Jesus, are you okay?

07:43.754 --> 07:44.714
Hey.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.258
Good talk.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.885
Nice sister moment.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.759
-Eat it.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.513
So where are you down from?

09:16.097 --> 09:17.807
'Round York.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.644
I heard it's beautiful around there.
Why'd you leave?

09:26.107 --> 09:27.608
Didn't have any choice.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.319
The walls kept the zeros out, but…

09:31.362 --> 09:32.905
didn't stop the virus from getting in.

09:35.992 --> 09:36.993
That's…

09:38.119 --> 09:39.328
I'm so sorry.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.081
Everybody lost somebody, right?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.283
-Hmm!

10:24.957 --> 10:26.334
So how's the new school?

10:27.251 --> 10:28.544
They have kombucha on tap.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.382
-Hey, morning.
-Billie.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.593
What are you doing?

10:35.676 --> 10:38.763
-Going to school?
-Uh, no.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.222
We should give it a few days.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.267
Dad, I'm fine. And I'm missing classes.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.853
-I don't think you should--
-I think she looks great.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.396
I mean, you said it yourself.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.775
If we miss too much school,
people could notice.

10:54.904 --> 10:55.738
Billie.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.448
Come here.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.408
Come here.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.245
Okay, look at me.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.675
And?

11:15.758 --> 11:16.926
It's better.

11:18.427 --> 11:19.679
So can I go?

11:19.762 --> 11:20.638
Uh…

11:20.721 --> 11:22.223
-That's a yes.
-Thanks, Dad.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.432
I… No, you, you…

11:23.516 --> 11:25.726
Call me if anything doesn't…

11:26.936 --> 11:28.020
feel right.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.022
Jade.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.900
Keep an eye on your sister.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.615
Do you feel like, weird?

11:40.241 --> 11:41.158
Mad?

11:41.242 --> 11:43.703
I'm mad that you keep asking me
asshole questions.

11:49.583 --> 11:50.876
Because I'm good.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.421
And after everything…

11:54.130 --> 11:56.716
everything that happened,
I just want things to be normal.

11:58.050 --> 11:58.968
Okay?

12:13.816 --> 12:14.734
Billie?

12:16.360 --> 12:17.528
Billie.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.114
Jade, hey.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.701
Hi, I'm Simon.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.080
I'm gonna be late.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.125
Stay.

12:31.876 --> 12:32.835
"Stay"?

12:33.836 --> 12:35.045
Hey.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.214
-Hey!
-What?

12:37.298 --> 12:40.176
What do you mean "what"?
The fuck just happened back there?

12:41.010 --> 12:45.639
Dad… Dad just gave me these drugs to sleep
and I just… I think I have a hangover.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.683
Yeah, I don't know.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.771
He's cute.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.648
-He's okay.
-He likes you.

12:55.399 --> 12:58.819
So what? Like, I miss one day,
and you have a boyfriend now?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.946
-No, he just helped me.
-With what?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.239
Homework.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.491
Look.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.327
You'd tell me
if something was wrong, right?

13:10.414 --> 13:11.373
You should go.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.626
Your boyfriend's waiting.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.299
I don't think your sister
likes me very much.

13:20.382 --> 13:21.509
Why do you care?

13:24.386 --> 13:26.430
She doesn't know you.
You literally just met.

13:27.264 --> 13:30.184
I don't know, it's just a vibe.
I'm quite good at reading people.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.813
And you think I'm super-hot.
Charming as shit.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.898
I think you're full of shit.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.361
The files you sent me
were only half downloaded.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.529
I need the rest.

13:41.612 --> 13:44.365
-I thought you said that that was a joke?
-It is.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.158
It's super funny.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.329
Umbrella does shady shit.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.832
-Like Facebook shady, but--
-So you can't get them.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.417
-No, I can.
-Then do it.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.629
You know, you're not like, bossy at all.

13:58.712 --> 13:59.922
You love it.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.800
Yeah.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.613
Four to cross.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.448
Well, you've come
to the right place.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.118
I don't know what you've heard,
but since our outfit's taken over,

14:29.201 --> 14:30.911
passage is much safer.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.997
Only three people died last month.

14:33.080 --> 14:33.998
"Three"?

14:34.081 --> 14:37.668
Well, if you want repeat business,
you've got to put the customer first.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.337
You sure you want to take a kid?

14:40.921 --> 14:43.257
-Whole team.
-It's your call.

14:43.966 --> 14:47.219
Right, all that's left then
is the dirty business of business.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.107
This will get you one.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.621
That'll do.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.874
All right, everybody in.

15:17.791 --> 15:18.751
My advice.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.003
Keep your eyes on the floor

15:21.086 --> 15:23.672
and your hands
and your feet tucked in tight.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.925
And we'll get you through,
quick and quiet.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.301
This is safe, right?

15:28.385 --> 15:29.345
Sure.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.642
Come on, come on,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

15:35.935 --> 15:36.810
Hey.

15:37.937 --> 15:38.771
It's okay.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.524
-Going up!

15:42.608 --> 15:43.734
Okay, let's go.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.505
Italian leather.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.299
Fancy.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.472
Come on, honey. You think I'd miss
your world-famous lemon salmon?

16:14.306 --> 16:15.474
I'll be home by eight.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.476
Promise.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.144
Love you, too.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.774
Sounds like things are better at home.

16:23.857 --> 16:24.900
I'm a great lay.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.611
Let's have some fun.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.031
<i>Now, I'm not gonna lie to you.</i>

16:32.658 --> 16:34.702
Tijuana was a setback.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.746
But Joy still represents
the future of this company.

16:38.706 --> 16:39.873
For most of its history,

16:39.957 --> 16:42.376
Umbrella's been a contractor
for the US government.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.422
But if we're gonna survive,
we have to look elsewhere.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.298
Outward, to the people.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.093
That's why you put me in charge.

16:51.176 --> 16:55.889
But I understand Dr. Wesker
wants to suspend this project.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.307
Oh, you heard wrong.

16:59.601 --> 17:00.477
Right, Al?

17:02.730 --> 17:04.356
Prescribed in the correct dosage,

17:05.190 --> 17:07.901
Joy can be a miracle pill.

17:07.985 --> 17:11.822
An antidepressant that lowers anxiety,
increases focus.

17:11.905 --> 17:14.825
But the drug contains
a derivative of the T-virus.

17:15.743 --> 17:19.246
A pathogen we originally developed
for the American military.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.998
That project was, um…

17:21.957 --> 17:22.916
ill-fated.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.795
And while we thought
we'd solved the problem,

17:26.879 --> 17:31.550
in larger doses, the viral load
not only activates the T-virus,

17:31.633 --> 17:33.469
it becomes transmissible.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.928
Usually through a bite.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.640
So we just tell people
not to bite each other.

17:40.517 --> 17:41.560
It's, um…

17:43.645 --> 17:45.606
-not that easy.

17:51.111 --> 17:55.032
This is what happens
when you overdose on Joy.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.701
The subject becomes desiccated.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.036
Violent.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.954
For rats, it takes a few hours.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.331
For a human…

18:02.998 --> 18:03.999
three days.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.377
But the end is always the same.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.381
The T-virus makes monsters.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.719
Joy, could be a billion-dollar drug,

18:15.803 --> 18:19.807
but we need to delay the launch
until we can stabilize it.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.477
Well, I don't
see this as a problem.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.396
Wait, did you… Did you say
you don't see that as a problem?

18:26.480 --> 18:28.023
It's an opportunity.

18:28.107 --> 18:28.982
Yes.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.776
We need to rethink Joy.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.820
That gives us a chance to make it better.

18:33.570 --> 18:38.951
See, in our trials, we found
that slightly tweaking the virus

18:39.034 --> 18:41.370
does something unexpected.

18:42.913 --> 18:47.668
This subject was given, let's call it,
a souped-up version of Joy.

19:09.648 --> 19:13.443
So this is our billion-dollar idea?

19:14.403 --> 19:16.071
-Dogs?
-No.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.992
Our team anticipates
a similar response in human trials.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.289
Which means,
it goes beyond the "feel good."

19:26.165 --> 19:30.377
The new Joy would allow us
to influence attention, behavior,

19:30.460 --> 19:32.546
all through a series of triggers.

19:32.629 --> 19:36.967
So imagine that same pattern
on a website or an app.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.636
A Joy user wouldn't be able to look away.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.848
So we're doing mind control now?

19:42.931 --> 19:44.850
Of course not, Janet.

19:44.933 --> 19:49.188
But hey, who hasn't popped a Xany
and gone hunting for Louboutin's.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.147
Right, Alan?

19:50.814 --> 19:53.775
Joy will make Umbrella
the biggest company in the world.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.028
Fuck Google, Fuck Zuckerberg.
They deliver eyeballs.

19:57.279 --> 20:00.282
Umbrella will deliver minds.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.076
That's not a billion-dollar drug.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.623
That's a trillion-dollar drug.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.293
None of which eliminates the danger.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.754
How much would I have
to take to turn into…

20:14.755 --> 20:15.672
that?

20:16.298 --> 20:17.299
Let's see.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.218
Three?

20:20.427 --> 20:21.386
No?

20:22.429 --> 20:23.430
Ten?

20:24.473 --> 20:25.641
Am I getting close?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.560
-Al?

20:29.853 --> 20:30.896
Twenty thousand.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.903
So we know what goes on the warning label.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.738
Right?

20:45.327 --> 20:47.287
<i>Attention, students.</i>

20:47.371 --> 20:50.290
<i>This is a reminder</i>
<i>that all personal items,</i>

20:50.374 --> 20:55.212
<i>including purses, helmets, and cellphones</i>
<i>should be kept in your locker.</i>

20:55.295 --> 20:56.505
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:25.200 --> 21:26.743
Can't help you, mate.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.711
So you haven't seen her?

21:35.794 --> 21:38.839
Well, even if I had,
which I'm not saying I have…

21:39.631 --> 21:41.383
I've got principles.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.136
Standards. Criteria and such.

21:44.219 --> 21:45.053
I…

21:46.096 --> 21:47.973
Is… is he for real?

21:48.056 --> 21:50.183
I have no idea what you're saying.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.936
What I'm saying is fuck off, Umbrella.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.163
Nice ride.

22:45.238 --> 22:46.448
Where you headed?

22:49.159 --> 22:49.993
Home.

22:50.702 --> 22:51.661
And where's that?

22:52.829 --> 22:54.164
The University.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.583
Like, a school?

22:57.834 --> 22:58.919
No.

23:00.295 --> 23:02.589
The University, it, uh…

23:04.299 --> 23:05.884
preserves the old world.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.513
Books, art, history.

23:11.056 --> 23:14.059
It's like a… a backup disk
for civilization.

23:15.936 --> 23:18.563
It will help us rebuild
when all of this is over.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.025
If it's ever over.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.903
What's it like?

23:26.905 --> 23:27.823
Peaceful.

23:32.994 --> 23:33.954
"Peaceful."

23:37.707 --> 23:41.336
Do you know what it was like to be… bored?

23:44.214 --> 23:45.966
I try not to think about it.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.593
The world that we had.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.098
The one they never got.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.941
Okay, next leg of the trip.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.485
Everyone keep your mouths shut.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.738
And I mean super glued.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.283
You hear me?

24:51.573 --> 24:52.449
What?

24:53.783 --> 24:54.618
Lickers.

24:55.368 --> 24:56.828
They hunt by sound.

25:15.639 --> 25:16.556
The hell?

25:21.186 --> 25:23.813
<i>Warning! You are engaged</i>
<i>in illegal activities</i>

25:23.897 --> 25:25.398
<i>under Umbrella jurisdiction!</i>

25:25.482 --> 25:26.900
<i>Do not resist!</i>

25:41.748 --> 25:43.458
<i>Do not start your engine.</i>

25:43.542 --> 25:45.293
<i>Do not exit the vehicle.</i>

25:45.377 --> 25:47.003
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

25:50.507 --> 25:51.841
Move out.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.099
Pull them out and line them up.

25:59.182 --> 26:00.308
Yes, sir.

26:01.184 --> 26:02.477
Let's go. Round them up.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.731
Where's that coming from?

26:09.693 --> 26:10.652
The heck?

26:15.740 --> 26:17.284
Contact!

26:22.038 --> 26:23.957
-What's happening?

26:24.040 --> 26:25.458
-Mom, look.

26:55.655 --> 26:56.615
Move.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.908
No, no, let me go. Let me go!

27:01.244 --> 27:02.829
-Hey, over here.

27:02.912 --> 27:04.289
-There's another way out.

27:05.081 --> 27:05.957
Here.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.005
-Go, go.
-Come on. Right this way.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.382
Go, go, go!

27:31.316 --> 27:32.901
Come on!

27:33.777 --> 27:35.445
-Help me!

27:49.793 --> 27:51.461
Service door. Down there.

27:51.544 --> 27:53.046
Go, go! Go!

27:54.506 --> 27:55.548
Come on!

28:19.614 --> 28:21.574
-Like I said…

28:21.658 --> 28:22.784
…fun.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.204
Mickey was a nice touch.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.667
-The Board decided.
-For you.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.544
It's a trillion dollars, Al.

28:33.586 --> 28:36.339
I'm offering them a bright shiny future,
and you've got, what?

28:37.966 --> 28:39.217
A fancy pen?

28:42.303 --> 28:43.847
How you doing?

28:43.930 --> 28:45.306
You seem edgy.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.475
Top off today?

28:53.773 --> 28:57.193
We took behavioral modification
off the table.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.486
I changed my mind.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.823
You're risking millions of lives
for what, money?

29:01.906 --> 29:02.991
A spot on the DOW?

29:03.074 --> 29:05.493
If this scales,
can't you see where this is going?

29:05.577 --> 29:07.829
It's not about the stock price.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.414
It's about changing the world.

29:10.373 --> 29:11.207
Just…

29:12.000 --> 29:13.293
think about it.

29:13.376 --> 29:14.961
Global warming, gone.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.504
World hunger, not anymore.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.547
Fuck.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.591
We can turn the world vegan if we want to.

29:19.674 --> 29:22.385
And who gets to decide any of that?

29:22.469 --> 29:23.636
Oh, I do.

29:26.389 --> 29:29.100
My friend at the FDA
agreed to rush human trials.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.186
-Because you bribed him.

29:31.978 --> 29:34.522
Because I'm such a charming lady.

29:36.483 --> 29:40.195
But I need you to stabilize the formula
and bring production online.

29:42.363 --> 29:45.658
What happened in Raccoon City,
we'll take precautions.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.577
The only precaution is a cure.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.121
-We don't have one of those.
-So let me find one.

29:51.372 --> 29:53.458
-Look, get me a team.
-I need you focused.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.126
I can do both.

29:55.210 --> 29:59.756
And, look, if something does go wrong,
and the virus gets out of control…

30:00.757 --> 30:07.514
imagine how much money
Umbrella makes if you own the cure?

30:14.938 --> 30:15.980
After hours.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.191
And Joy come first.

30:18.274 --> 30:20.151
-Fine.
-Fine.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.280
-Wait, Evelyn, don't do that.
-Oh, and, Al?

30:26.491 --> 30:28.243
No more surprises.

30:30.411 --> 30:31.955
I don't like surprises.

30:39.295 --> 30:40.839
Viral modulation.

30:41.881 --> 30:45.343
Think of it as Darwinism
on a molecular scale.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.264
Virus has literally changed
the cells of their host

30:49.347 --> 30:52.767
for their own survival and reproduction.

30:52.851 --> 30:57.981
And as a virus alters
or modulates its host,

30:58.857 --> 31:01.109
what does that look like to us?

31:06.656 --> 31:09.951
<i>Symptoms from the everyday stuff.</i>

31:10.034 --> 31:12.787
<i>Sweating, vomiting,</i>

31:12.871 --> 31:18.042
<i>to the extreme cases where viruses</i>
<i>attack the blood-brain barrier,</i>

31:18.126 --> 31:20.420
<i>causing hallucinations.</i>

31:22.839 --> 31:27.468
Changes in mood, behavior,
violent outbursts,

31:27.552 --> 31:30.597
until the body can fight it off or…

31:31.639 --> 31:33.016
not.

31:38.187 --> 31:39.856
Dude.

31:55.788 --> 31:57.290
<i>Attention, students…</i>

31:57.373 --> 31:58.708
Sorry.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.087
<i>Breathe.</i>

32:53.972 --> 32:55.556
Where are we?

32:55.640 --> 32:57.141
Service tunnel.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.851
Which way to the surface?

32:58.935 --> 32:59.852
Up.

33:44.772 --> 33:45.982
Mom.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.442
Come on, just a bit further.

33:48.109 --> 33:49.110
What's wrong?

33:49.193 --> 33:52.488
Just a little further, yeah?
Come on, Liam.

33:53.781 --> 33:54.824
He's fine.

33:55.533 --> 33:58.036
-You've got to get up. Come on.
-Get him up. We gotta go.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.709
-He's infected.
-No, no, he… he isn't.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.172
When did bright light start bothering him?

34:10.089 --> 34:12.341
Loud noises? When was he bit?

34:12.425 --> 34:14.343
-No, it… It's not--
-Three days ago.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.221
That's why you couldn't take the ferry.

34:17.305 --> 34:19.807
We had to get to Calais.
There were rumors.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.851
The Brotherhood has a cure.

34:21.934 --> 34:23.644
The Brotherhood skin people alive.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.439
They don't have a cure! There is no cure!

34:27.732 --> 34:28.649
Fuck this.

34:35.823 --> 34:37.700
No.

34:39.952 --> 34:41.162
No!

34:42.413 --> 34:44.415
You love him. I get it.

34:45.374 --> 34:48.544
But the minute someone is infected,
they don't care about you anymore.

34:51.839 --> 34:53.257
They don't love you anymore.

34:58.596 --> 34:59.764
Run!

35:00.681 --> 35:03.601
Fucking run!

35:05.603 --> 35:07.438
Run!

35:08.022 --> 35:09.941
-Run…

35:16.364 --> 35:18.324
Come on, run. Come on.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.801
Here. Here. Through here.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.469
-Come on.
-Go.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.060
Come on.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.146
Fuck. Fuck!

35:50.690 --> 35:52.233
What now?

36:06.247 --> 36:07.415
Mark?

36:16.841 --> 36:18.009
Count ten…

36:19.385 --> 36:20.553
then go.

36:25.349 --> 36:26.559
No. Mark.

36:55.171 --> 36:56.380
Come on.

37:25.868 --> 37:26.786
I got it.

37:26.869 --> 37:27.703
Come on.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.330
-I got it.
-Go.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.374
-I fucking--

37:56.065 --> 37:57.400
Shit.

38:35.604 --> 38:37.148
You get the rest yet?

38:38.107 --> 38:39.567
The firewall's been updated.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.695
Okay, so?

38:42.778 --> 38:45.281
So Umbrella hasn't updated
their security in two years.

38:46.115 --> 38:47.908
Jade. What's going on?

38:50.077 --> 38:51.579
I can't tell you, but…

38:51.662 --> 38:52.913
-I don't know.
-Jade, seriously.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.665
Simon, get off of me.

38:54.749 --> 38:55.833
You can't just
keep telling me what to do

38:55.916 --> 38:57.752
-without telling me what's going on.
-Get off.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.920
-Don't touch her.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.464
-Shit. Billie.

39:11.057 --> 39:11.891
Billie, wait!

39:11.974 --> 39:13.601
What is wrong with your sister?

39:14.685 --> 39:15.770
Jade.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.274
Jade, can you just hold on?

39:25.529 --> 39:26.489
Jade?

39:28.949 --> 39:30.534
Jade Wesker?

39:32.244 --> 39:33.204
Hi, Mom.

39:34.330 --> 39:35.664
Jade, you don't know me, honey,

39:35.748 --> 39:38.793
but I've been watching you
grow up in pictures for years.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.878
Your dad and I go <i>way</i> back.

39:40.961 --> 39:42.797
He's a brilliant man.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.467
-You want a ride?
-I'm good.

39:53.265 --> 39:54.475
Billie…

40:14.912 --> 40:15.871
Billie?

40:22.920 --> 40:24.004
Billie?

40:39.270 --> 40:40.563
I think…

40:43.899 --> 40:45.901
I think something's wrong with me.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.369
This whole time…

40:59.540 --> 41:00.541
I thought…

41:03.127 --> 41:05.045
maybe if I just ignore it…

41:07.840 --> 41:09.175
then it would all go away…

41:10.301 --> 41:11.969
and everything would be normal.

41:13.846 --> 41:15.097
I hurt you.

41:16.515 --> 41:17.683
I hurt people.

41:18.559 --> 41:19.977
I've been hearing things.

41:21.020 --> 41:22.271
Seeing things.

41:25.816 --> 41:27.026
Lights…

41:28.777 --> 41:29.904
they feel like…

41:31.572 --> 41:34.158
like drills in my brain.

41:36.785 --> 41:37.953
And sounds.

41:40.164 --> 41:42.124
Sounds just hurt my bones.

41:44.627 --> 41:46.754
I can feel all of that.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.132
But I can't feel this.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.305
What's wrong with me?

42:02.019 --> 42:03.270
The dog…

42:05.189 --> 42:06.815
might have been sick.

42:07.691 --> 42:09.151
What does that mean?

42:09.985 --> 42:11.820
I found this thing online.

42:11.904 --> 42:14.573
Same kind of thing happened
in an Umbrella factory.

42:15.407 --> 42:18.035
A guy got bit, and three days later…

42:18.118 --> 42:19.078
What?

42:22.873 --> 42:24.208
He went crazy.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.085
He killed people.

42:27.920 --> 42:28.837
What?

42:29.922 --> 42:32.091
But it's… It's fucked up.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.301
And it's not true.

42:35.344 --> 42:38.264
This is just the drugs.
Like you said earlier.

42:39.431 --> 42:40.975
And if it's not?

42:41.058 --> 42:42.059
It is.

42:46.355 --> 42:47.731
Billie, look at me.

42:48.899 --> 42:49.858
No.

42:51.902 --> 42:53.112
Look at me.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.667
Don't cry.

43:08.460 --> 43:09.962
Everything's gonna be fine.

43:42.119 --> 43:43.120
Enya.

43:44.455 --> 43:45.581
Leave him.

43:47.333 --> 43:48.876
He's not yours anymore.

43:57.551 --> 43:58.886
I can't.

44:51.397 --> 44:54.441
Took you long enough, huh?

44:54.525 --> 44:58.320
Ha, it got pretty crazy back there, right?

44:58.404 --> 45:01.907
Like, "Ah, brain monsters."

45:03.117 --> 45:05.285
-Let's, uh…

45:07.496 --> 45:08.706
Let's not.

45:18.632 --> 45:20.050
Don't move!

45:20.134 --> 45:21.218
You're surrounded.

45:21.301 --> 45:23.345
Don't move!

45:24.346 --> 45:25.597
Take them now!

45:28.350 --> 45:29.643
Drop your weapon.

45:33.188 --> 45:34.481
Dude.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.191
Ouch.

45:38.861 --> 45:40.863
You know who we are, huh?

45:40.946 --> 45:42.156
We know you.

45:44.616 --> 45:46.201
Umbrella.

45:47.953 --> 45:48.871
Fascist.

45:49.955 --> 45:50.998
Come here.

45:51.081 --> 45:52.291
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

45:52.374 --> 45:53.792
-I'm… I'm not--
