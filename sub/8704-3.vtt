WEBVTT

00:11.315 --> 00:12.898
We're going that way.

00:12.950 --> 00:14.316
That's a ship killer.

00:14.319 --> 00:15.702
We should have taken the pardons.

00:15.737 --> 00:17.680
The men, I understand.

00:17.682 --> 00:19.489
Flint had them exactly
where he needed them.

00:19.491 --> 00:22.537
But he had me there, too.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.495
- These are identical.
- What are you suggesting?

00:25.497 --> 00:27.714
That we exchange it, find partners,

00:27.749 --> 00:30.833
and trade coin for commodities
far easier to protect.

00:30.835 --> 00:33.386
I returned to go on
the account as I know it,

00:33.421 --> 00:34.553
because in this place

00:34.588 --> 00:36.756
I believed I could find
the men necessary to do so.

00:36.808 --> 00:38.341
And in particular one man

00:38.393 --> 00:39.809
that I thought worthy
of standing alongside me

00:39.844 --> 00:41.728
at the head of a terrible fleet.

00:41.763 --> 00:44.397
I'm all too aware what Charles
Vane's capable of destroying

00:44.432 --> 00:45.815
when he sets his mind on it.

00:45.850 --> 00:48.651
What is it you would like
to have him take from you?

00:48.687 --> 00:50.153
Captain Flint is dead.

00:53.238 --> 00:54.084
We're not moving.

00:54.136 --> 00:56.522
The storm drove us east. We are becalmed.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.905
Son of the wealthiest man
in St. Kitts, they say.

03:13.710 --> 03:15.294
Also say he fucked his partner

03:15.330 --> 03:16.882
out of their trading company.

03:18.333 --> 03:19.845
Stole it all.

03:21.219 --> 03:23.919
A world where he's the civilized
one and we're the savages

03:24.728 --> 03:27.423
is a world I'm never
gonna fuckin' understand.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.909
Oh.

03:46.944 --> 03:49.028
That was nice.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.863
Hopefully we have shown you our thanks

03:50.915 --> 03:53.783
for agreeing to conduct
this transaction on our soil

03:53.835 --> 03:55.785
and that we can be most hospitable

03:55.837 --> 03:57.528
to our partners in trade.

03:58.208 --> 04:00.356
Now shall we conclude our business?

04:01.592 --> 04:05.592
316 black pearls to be exchanged

04:05.630 --> 04:09.630
for 46,121 pieces of eight.

04:10.018 --> 04:12.802
The method of our figuring
this value for each item

04:12.804 --> 04:15.279
has been recorded if either
party wishes to know it.

04:15.331 --> 04:16.639
I would like to see it, please.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.769
A literate Negress.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.484
Is there no end to the surprises
this place has to offer?

04:28.536 --> 04:29.618
What the fuck did he just say?

04:32.540 --> 04:34.110
I imagine she comes from slave stock.

04:34.968 --> 04:36.531
Of some sort, yeah?

04:37.545 --> 04:40.145
I understand she can dress
as a civilized woman,

04:40.715 --> 04:44.050
but to behave as one, that is impressive.

04:44.085 --> 04:47.169
The accounts are acceptable.
We have a deal.

04:50.341 --> 04:52.164
You seem like a lovely creature.

04:53.177 --> 04:56.312
When the governor arrives,
if you do indeed flee,

04:56.347 --> 04:57.396
there will be a place for you in my employ.

04:57.432 --> 05:00.399
Governor? What governor?

05:03.855 --> 05:05.404
You are disposing of your treasury

05:05.440 --> 05:07.273
of ill-gotten plunder

05:07.325 --> 05:10.826
so you might leave this place
before the new regime arrives.

05:10.862 --> 05:13.863
That's what I thought this was
all about in the first place.

05:16.334 --> 05:18.584
You don't know, do you?

05:20.421 --> 05:22.505
- Invasion?
- A fleet.

05:22.540 --> 05:24.707
Eight ships, soldiers, 700,

05:24.709 --> 05:27.510
all led by a man claiming to have
been appointed governor of this place

05:27.545 --> 05:28.844
and empowered to take it back

05:28.880 --> 05:30.713
by force if necessary.

05:30.715 --> 05:33.215
News of this is spreading quickly.

05:33.267 --> 05:35.634
How long until they arrive here?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.387
12 days, approximately.

05:40.669 --> 05:43.309
How many batteries have been
repaired on the fort walls?

05:43.361 --> 05:45.027
Two. Two guns each.

05:45.062 --> 05:46.979
The fifth and sixth guns
are going up tomorrow.

05:47.031 --> 05:48.531
Did he say how the fleet was comprised?

05:48.566 --> 05:49.532
How many men of war?

05:49.567 --> 05:51.150
He didn't say.

05:51.202 --> 05:52.535
Well, how many guns did he say?

05:52.570 --> 05:53.536
He didn't say.

05:53.571 --> 05:54.820
Well, whatever it is,

05:54.872 --> 05:55.905
six guns ain't gonna be enough to stop it.

05:55.907 --> 05:58.407
If they were supporting a fleet in the bay.

05:58.409 --> 05:59.929
A line in defense of the harbor mouth.

05:59.977 --> 06:02.044
Yeah, but how many of those crews

06:02.079 --> 06:04.079
can we honestly expect
to participate in that fight?

06:04.132 --> 06:05.987
A third? Half if we're lucky?

06:06.682 --> 06:08.057
What if it were all of them?

06:08.643 --> 06:09.683
All the crews.

06:09.735 --> 06:11.935
All that matter, yes.

06:15.357 --> 06:18.158
Burgess. Woodall. The Cockrams.

06:18.193 --> 06:19.693
Have you met those people?

06:19.745 --> 06:22.380
They're not exactly
a rally around a flag sort.

06:22.781 --> 06:25.080
How could you possibly convince them all

06:25.115 --> 06:26.249
to join a fight like this?

06:26.285 --> 06:28.952
Because if they all join,
there may be no fight.

06:29.004 --> 06:30.870
A show of force.

06:30.923 --> 06:33.506
A massive show of force.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.125
A thousand men, a dozen ships,

06:35.177 --> 06:36.676
plus the man o' war,

06:36.712 --> 06:38.295
all organized for battle.

06:38.347 --> 06:40.764
Organized under who? Flint is
still nowhere to be found.

06:40.799 --> 06:42.966
He'll return in time, and
if he doesn't, I'll do it.

06:43.018 --> 06:45.719
Look me in the face
and tell me you doubt it.

06:48.140 --> 06:51.474
If we all unite, the fight that
we will present to our invaders

06:51.526 --> 06:53.700
will appear so costly and painful,

06:53.736 --> 06:55.138
they will choose to walk away from it

06:55.174 --> 06:57.230
rather than risk humiliation at our hands.

06:57.282 --> 06:58.898
Increase their fear of defeat,

06:58.951 --> 07:01.430
and we decrease the cost of our victory.

07:02.773 --> 07:04.227
I believe it is to be done.

07:05.461 --> 07:06.461
Tell me you do, too,

07:06.491 --> 07:08.908
and we'll make it happen together.

07:19.471 --> 07:20.921
I've just concluded meeting

07:20.957 --> 07:22.756
with Commodore Chamberlain and his staff.

07:22.808 --> 07:25.809
The date has been set
for our arrival in Nassau,

07:25.844 --> 07:27.594
roughly two weeks from today,

07:27.646 --> 07:29.262
and when that happens,

07:29.264 --> 07:30.930
decisions are gonna be made
over a matter of hours

07:30.932 --> 07:34.150
that will determine the future of
the island for decades to come.

07:34.186 --> 07:37.771
And almost all of it
is going to depend upon that.

07:39.016 --> 07:40.430
What is this?

07:40.942 --> 07:43.443
The address I intend to make
to the inhabitants of Nassau

07:43.495 --> 07:44.828
in which I will invite them all

07:44.863 --> 07:46.413
to accept the King's pardon

07:46.448 --> 07:49.249
and join my efforts to restore law, order,

07:49.284 --> 07:51.582
and commerce to new Providence island.

07:52.954 --> 07:56.539
So you're just going
to sail into the harbor,

07:56.591 --> 07:58.876
row yourself onto the beach, and read this?

07:59.678 --> 08:02.462
Captain Hornigold believes
that without Captain Flint,

08:02.464 --> 08:04.014
there is no one left on that island

08:04.049 --> 08:06.800
capable of mounting an
organized defense of the bay.

08:06.852 --> 08:08.635
Do you disagree?

08:08.637 --> 08:10.303
An organized defense?

08:10.305 --> 08:13.273
Captain Flint was the only
true strategist among them.

08:13.308 --> 08:14.808
But that doesn't mean that the others

08:14.860 --> 08:16.609
won't mount a disorganized one.

08:17.158 --> 08:19.979
Well, I'm not concerned
about the odd skirmish.

08:20.032 --> 08:23.366
All that matters is whether that works.

08:23.402 --> 08:24.984
Commodore Chamberlain is resolved

08:24.986 --> 08:27.454
that either the pirates
take to the pardon immediately

08:27.489 --> 08:31.207
or Nassau will be considered
hostile territory.

08:31.243 --> 08:34.461
He would then mount a full-scale
invasion of the beach,

08:34.496 --> 08:36.046
costing me any chance I might have

08:36.081 --> 08:37.703
of a peaceful transition.

08:39.054 --> 08:40.667
And you need my help to ensure

08:40.669 --> 08:42.802
that this address is drawn
to win the most converts?

08:42.837 --> 08:45.004
Precisely.

08:45.269 --> 08:47.331
How sure are you
that it would be a bad thing?

08:48.477 --> 08:49.843
What's that?

08:49.845 --> 08:52.011
If the Navy took over, stormed
the beach and cleared it,

08:52.013 --> 08:53.928
and why would that be such a bad thing?

08:55.100 --> 08:57.734
I wouldn't say "law and order" here.

08:57.769 --> 09:00.653
Either is fine. The
phrase they find upsetting.

09:00.689 --> 09:02.689
If the Navy takes the beach,

09:02.741 --> 09:04.657
there is no way I will recapture the trust

09:04.693 --> 09:06.526
of the men who would
otherwise have surrendered.

09:06.528 --> 09:08.027
You wouldn't need their trust

09:08.080 --> 09:09.863
if they were either
dead or terrified of you.

09:09.915 --> 09:12.332
Seems the Navy is offering
to see to one or the other.

09:12.367 --> 09:14.200
It could take months to
pacify the island by force.

09:14.252 --> 09:16.169
It would be preferable to me

09:16.204 --> 09:18.037
to spend those months building commerce

09:18.090 --> 09:20.039
instead of putting out fires.

09:20.092 --> 09:22.008
Yes, but if the Navy were to remove anybody

09:22.043 --> 09:23.259
who was setting those fires,

09:23.295 --> 09:25.011
again, would that not be preferable?

09:25.046 --> 09:27.365
How exactly did you become
the one asking questions here?

09:28.266 --> 09:29.549
And anyone who thinks it's so easy

09:29.551 --> 09:31.050
to win a war by force

09:31.103 --> 09:33.183
has never actually been
responsible for fighting one.

09:37.692 --> 09:40.310
You're not saying that you can't win.

09:40.362 --> 09:42.860
You're saying it would
take too long to win it.

09:44.699 --> 09:46.149
With all these resources,
you could outlast them.

09:46.201 --> 09:48.344
Clearly you could outlast them.

09:49.488 --> 09:51.841
So why are you so concerned about the time?

09:56.912 --> 09:59.245
There were a number of parties

09:59.247 --> 10:01.214
to whom I had to make promises

10:01.249 --> 10:03.633
in exchange for their
support of this operation,

10:03.668 --> 10:06.419
schedules that had to be met.

10:06.421 --> 10:08.304
And with many of these parties,

10:08.340 --> 10:10.974
Whitehall, my equity
investors, my creditors,

10:11.009 --> 10:12.892
the lapse of a deadline or two

10:12.928 --> 10:14.260
might be bargained away.

10:14.262 --> 10:17.147
But there is one particular party

10:17.182 --> 10:19.732
whose Patience I do not wish to test,

10:19.768 --> 10:22.268
a party whose history
with the pirates of Nassau

10:22.270 --> 10:25.104
suggests an extreme
reaction would likely follow.

10:25.106 --> 10:26.823
Spain.

10:31.863 --> 10:33.863
What did you have to promise them?

10:33.915 --> 10:36.699
That I would seize fort Nassau,

10:36.751 --> 10:40.086
secure the remains of the Urca
de Lima's gold stored within it,

10:40.121 --> 10:41.621
and return it to Havana.

10:41.673 --> 10:43.719
Promptly.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.459
Failure to do so would confirm for them

10:46.511 --> 10:48.545
that I am simply a pirate by another name,

10:48.597 --> 10:49.929
not to be trusted,

10:49.965 --> 10:52.966
and would result in a launch
of a fleet of ten ships

10:52.968 --> 10:56.968
and soldiers numbering 1,500
to raze Nassau to the ground.

10:57.272 --> 10:59.138
How long did they give you?

10:59.644 --> 11:02.566
Eight weeks.

11:02.944 --> 11:04.527
Eight? Jesus.

11:04.563 --> 11:07.447
As long as the fort is taken
quickly and in its entirety,

11:07.482 --> 11:09.482
everything should be fine.

11:17.325 --> 11:19.323
We're all dead men.

11:20.579 --> 11:23.353
Smote by a storm,

11:24.633 --> 11:26.666
the product of his rage.

11:31.139 --> 11:33.056
We are dead men.

11:34.843 --> 11:37.510
Consigned to a place
where we are no longer worthy

11:37.512 --> 11:40.430
even of the good lord's anger

11:40.482 --> 11:44.100
and must endure his indifference.

11:44.152 --> 11:47.820
We are dead men.

11:47.856 --> 11:49.822
Left to suffer,

11:49.858 --> 11:52.492
knowing that he no longer hears our cries,

11:52.527 --> 11:55.778
because in this place...

11:55.830 --> 11:57.530
He is absent.

11:59.701 --> 12:01.334
How bad is it?

12:01.369 --> 12:02.785
Since we've been becalmed,

12:02.837 --> 12:04.370
our rate of drift has suggested

12:04.422 --> 12:06.122
we had a good chance of making landfall

12:06.174 --> 12:07.674
on one of these islands

12:07.709 --> 12:11.094
in approximately a week to ten days' time.

12:11.129 --> 12:13.212
Based on our readings today
and yesterday, however,

12:13.265 --> 12:15.932
I would say that that
estimate is far too optimistic.

12:18.553 --> 12:20.233
We'll have to cut the men's rations again.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.276
I agree.

12:26.311 --> 12:30.311
If anything, stores are
dwindling faster than we thought.

12:30.699 --> 12:33.066
Fresh water is just about gone.

12:33.118 --> 12:34.117
Food stores have been empty

12:34.152 --> 12:35.785
for about three days,

12:35.820 --> 12:38.237
and the haul from the eel
nets isn't keeping pace.

12:38.239 --> 12:40.456
Mr. silver and I will inform the crew.

12:40.492 --> 12:42.226
It can't be uniform,

12:43.495 --> 12:45.824
the decreases in rations.

12:47.082 --> 12:48.081
At a certain point,

12:48.083 --> 12:49.415
if we're all weakened beyond the point

12:49.467 --> 12:50.917
at which any of us can hoist our sails,

12:50.969 --> 12:52.385
we're all dead anyway.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.637
Then what would you suggest?

12:54.673 --> 12:57.140
I would suggest that we draw up two lists.

12:57.175 --> 12:58.641
One with the names of the men

12:58.677 --> 13:02.677
critical to sailing this
ship once the wind returns,

13:02.847 --> 13:04.981
and second, the men who aren't.

13:05.797 --> 13:08.685
You think we should feed some
of the men more than others?

13:08.737 --> 13:12.286
No, I think we should feed
some of the men and not others.

13:14.025 --> 13:16.409
The survival of the greatest
number of men on this crew

13:16.444 --> 13:18.077
rests entirely on our ability

13:18.113 --> 13:20.079
to maneuver this ship to land.

13:20.115 --> 13:22.198
Any food that is diverted away from men

13:22.250 --> 13:24.784
necessary to that end
only increases our chance

13:24.836 --> 13:27.620
that every one of us on this ship dies.

13:27.672 --> 13:29.372
You can't divide the men like that.

13:29.424 --> 13:30.757
Most of the men on that list

13:30.792 --> 13:31.924
will survive in a weakened state.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.760
Most of them.

13:36.464 --> 13:38.131
Well, why not just take the second list

13:38.133 --> 13:40.460
and push 'em over the side right now?

13:41.136 --> 13:42.301
Wouldn't that save us all a lot of trouble?

13:42.354 --> 13:43.803
Hey, hey, hey.

13:43.855 --> 13:45.638
Those men out there hear
the two of you arguing,

13:45.690 --> 13:47.640
and they might just lose
whatever faith they've got left

13:47.642 --> 13:49.482
that we have any idea
what we're doing in here.

13:52.697 --> 13:54.447
I will challenge you

13:54.482 --> 13:57.263
with the men and resist this plan.

14:00.989 --> 14:03.990
If you challenge me in any way
while we exist in this state,

14:04.042 --> 14:05.541
I will be forced to make an issue

14:05.577 --> 14:07.710
of how we entered into
it in the first place.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.829
How your failure to inform them

14:09.831 --> 14:11.381
of the danger inherent

14:11.416 --> 14:13.716
in investigating Hallendale's ship

14:13.752 --> 14:15.752
led us into the trap that began all this.

14:15.804 --> 14:17.724
It is his responsibility to challenge you.

14:17.756 --> 14:19.273
Not now.

14:20.953 --> 14:22.642
Not in this state.

14:25.930 --> 14:27.647
I'm asserting that as captain

14:27.682 --> 14:29.982
in a life-threatening situation,

14:30.018 --> 14:34.018
it is my right to have complete
control over ship and men

14:34.489 --> 14:36.689
for the sake of their collective welfare

14:36.741 --> 14:39.242
until such time as we emerge
from this situation.

14:39.277 --> 14:42.862
In the meantime, I will compile two lists.

14:45.450 --> 14:48.868
Those men entitled to full
food and water rations,

14:48.920 --> 14:52.038
and those only on limited
water for the time being.

15:02.016 --> 15:04.183
We'll need to keep a close eye on him.

15:04.219 --> 15:06.552
As dehydration sets in,

15:06.554 --> 15:08.740
we will all be subject to its effects.

15:09.524 --> 15:12.891
Loss of reason, anger...

15:14.657 --> 15:16.446
Eventually hallucinations.

15:16.481 --> 15:19.336
He isn't losin' his mind.

15:20.735 --> 15:22.960
He's been concerned
about this for some time.

15:23.655 --> 15:25.288
About you.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.233
He thinks I have lost my reason.

15:29.461 --> 15:30.576
That the events of Charlestown

15:30.578 --> 15:32.462
and everything since is driving me mad.

15:32.497 --> 15:33.629
Is it?

15:57.605 --> 16:00.490
You want us to combine our forces

16:00.525 --> 16:02.909
and engage a fleet of a half a dozen ships,

16:02.944 --> 16:04.494
and you want us to do it

16:04.529 --> 16:07.113
with six guns supporting us from the fort

16:07.115 --> 16:09.916
so that we can frighten
the British Navy into retreat?

16:09.951 --> 16:12.752
We understand
there are eight ships, not six.

16:12.787 --> 16:14.036
Yes, to the rest of it.

16:14.088 --> 16:15.121
Jesus Christ, Jack.

16:15.173 --> 16:16.788
Uh, if I may.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.626
It stands to reason that if we
threaten to defend this place,

16:20.678 --> 16:23.129
then we need to have a plan
to follow through.

16:23.131 --> 16:24.380
If the bluff is called, then we...

16:24.432 --> 16:26.299
there is no bluff here.

16:26.351 --> 16:27.466
If we can discourage them from engaging,

16:27.468 --> 16:28.601
so much the better.

16:28.636 --> 16:31.103
If not, we fight to protect the island.

16:31.139 --> 16:32.388
With who in command of the fleet?

16:32.440 --> 16:34.557
No one's seen Flint in weeks.

16:34.609 --> 16:36.392
When he hears news
of the invasion, he'll return.

16:36.444 --> 16:37.944
But if he doesn't?

16:37.979 --> 16:40.947
No man has his skill
in leading a fleet in battle.

16:40.982 --> 16:42.597
Not even you.

16:43.284 --> 16:45.472
What the fuck's the matter with you people?

16:46.321 --> 16:48.237
We haven't done enough for you?

16:48.289 --> 16:49.405
You turn your back on us now?

16:49.457 --> 16:51.073
You can see his point, though.

16:51.125 --> 16:53.159
If no Flint, the strategy involved

16:53.161 --> 16:54.360
in coordinating this fleet will be...

16:54.395 --> 16:57.380
That's enough. You, sit down.

16:57.415 --> 17:00.166
And the rest of you, please listen closely.

17:00.168 --> 17:02.168
I never approved of Eleanor Guthrie's

17:02.220 --> 17:04.002
harsh mothering of this place.

17:04.005 --> 17:06.505
I believe my record
on that issue is in good order.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.057
That said, if you're going
to behave like children,

17:08.092 --> 17:09.308
then I will be your daddy.

17:09.344 --> 17:11.477
When this meeting breaks,

17:11.512 --> 17:13.930
I will address the street, your crews,

17:13.982 --> 17:16.566
and I will persuade them

17:16.601 --> 17:19.318
that a defense of this place
isn't just desirable,

17:19.354 --> 17:22.688
it is critical to their ability
to call themselves men.

17:23.359 --> 17:25.107
I'll have them in such a state

17:25.159 --> 17:26.992
that any captain in this room

17:27.028 --> 17:30.446
who speaks in opposition to this plan...

17:30.498 --> 17:32.999
opposition borne from what?

17:33.034 --> 17:35.388
A fear of losing.

17:36.004 --> 17:38.569
Will not long call himself captain.

17:40.561 --> 17:41.757
Hmm?

17:41.793 --> 17:43.342
I'm committed to this.

17:43.378 --> 17:44.677
Charles is committed to this.

17:44.712 --> 17:46.379
Captain Flint will be returning soon.

17:46.431 --> 17:49.048
He is most committed to this.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.216
And if that weren't enough,

17:50.218 --> 17:51.634
you will recall that Anne and I

17:51.686 --> 17:54.103
have put thousands
of pieces into your pockets

17:54.138 --> 17:55.554
in contemplation of the day

17:55.607 --> 17:57.440
when your cooperation would be called upon

17:57.475 --> 17:59.141
to defend this place.

17:59.193 --> 18:02.528
That day is today, and
you will answer the call.

18:02.563 --> 18:05.314
Flint is dead.

18:09.737 --> 18:13.739
News was in St. Kitts.
Went down in a storm,

18:13.791 --> 18:16.993
pursued by the leading
edge of this invasion force,

18:17.045 --> 18:20.876
the pirate hunter by the
name of Benjamin Hornigold.

18:22.917 --> 18:25.551
Before anyone commits to anything,

18:25.586 --> 18:28.337
just know that you'll be
doing it without Flint.

18:31.643 --> 18:35.094
But I may be able to offer an alternative.

18:44.689 --> 18:47.273
Let us agree that if you walk downstairs

18:47.275 --> 18:48.824
without something to
bring those men together,

18:48.860 --> 18:53.162
to unify them, there will
be no defense of this harbor,

18:53.197 --> 18:55.281
that you will fall the moment challenged.

18:55.283 --> 18:57.750
And you can offer me that something?

18:57.785 --> 19:00.870
Yes. Me.

19:00.922 --> 19:04.457
I'm prepared to step into
Captain Flint's shoes,

19:04.459 --> 19:06.676
unify those men, prosecute
a defense of the harbor,

19:06.711 --> 19:09.545
and repel the Navy from here definitively

19:09.597 --> 19:13.597
if once I've done it,

19:13.801 --> 19:16.602
you agree to join me in
sailing away from here for good.

19:24.862 --> 19:28.397
You would enter into a fight

19:28.449 --> 19:31.567
to defend something you
have so little regard for

19:31.619 --> 19:33.507
just to have my partnership?

19:33.718 --> 19:35.039
Yes.

19:36.791 --> 19:39.291
I know you're incapable
of running from this fight,

19:39.327 --> 19:42.249
going back on your word
to your friend downstairs,

19:43.164 --> 19:44.365
so I won't ask you to.

19:46.134 --> 19:49.468
But I will offer you the
best of all possible worlds...

19:51.756 --> 19:54.996
beating the English,
keeping your word to Rackham,

19:55.676 --> 19:58.094
and being free of the burden
of this place all at once.

19:58.146 --> 19:59.512
Burden of this place?

19:59.514 --> 20:02.014
You not heard a word I've said?

20:02.066 --> 20:04.266
I am committed to it.

20:04.318 --> 20:06.235
Your commitment is your burden.

20:06.270 --> 20:09.105
Consider what this place
has forced you to become

20:09.157 --> 20:11.574
since you made that commitment...

20:11.609 --> 20:14.693
a slaveholder, a man
forced to beg his peers

20:14.746 --> 20:16.112
to join him in battle.

20:16.164 --> 20:17.580
There's not a man in that parlor

20:17.615 --> 20:18.831
who would lift a finger in your defense,

20:18.866 --> 20:20.499
yet you would die in theirs.

20:20.535 --> 20:22.752
Jack would. Jack has.

20:22.787 --> 20:24.286
Of course he has.

20:24.338 --> 20:25.755
How else does a man like that

20:25.790 --> 20:27.289
survive in a place like this

20:27.341 --> 20:29.417
except cleave himself
to one stronger than he?

20:30.378 --> 20:32.815
And for this, he offers you what?

20:33.681 --> 20:37.681
Loyalty? That is how a dog survives.

20:37.885 --> 20:39.435
Not a man.

20:39.470 --> 20:41.303
I do not seek your partnership

20:41.355 --> 20:43.773
because I am too weak to defend myself.

20:43.808 --> 20:45.248
I don't seek it to protect my things

20:45.276 --> 20:46.276
or to increase profit.

20:46.310 --> 20:48.050
Then why do you?

20:49.230 --> 20:51.275
You've been gone eight years,

20:51.277 --> 20:53.980
and suddenly my partnership
is this valuable to you?

20:56.272 --> 20:57.272
Why?

20:58.206 --> 21:00.140
Eight years.

21:01.659 --> 21:03.891
Nine wives.

21:05.213 --> 21:06.662
No sons.

21:11.335 --> 21:13.252
There is an instinct to leave behind

21:13.254 --> 21:15.625
something made in one's own image.

21:17.341 --> 21:19.725
Nature has denied me the
ability, it would seem,

21:19.760 --> 21:21.143
but not the need.

21:23.681 --> 21:25.927
But whereas the natural way

21:26.601 --> 21:29.122
requires no consent from the other party,

21:29.821 --> 21:32.104
in this case, I'm not so lucky.

21:35.026 --> 21:38.398
So there it is.

21:39.447 --> 21:40.779
Yes or no?

22:03.604 --> 22:04.854
He's leaving.

22:04.889 --> 22:07.473
Once this is done,
assuming we're still alive,

22:07.525 --> 22:09.441
he's leaving with Teach.

22:11.279 --> 22:12.870
I heard.

22:14.065 --> 22:15.921
It bothers me...

22:16.901 --> 22:19.235
I don't know why, but it bothers me.

22:19.287 --> 22:20.736
Why do you think that is?

22:20.788 --> 22:22.872
'Cause you give a shit
what he thinks of you?

22:22.907 --> 22:24.039
You always have.

22:24.075 --> 22:27.209
- You think?
- Yeah.

22:27.245 --> 22:29.295
You ain't alone.

22:29.330 --> 22:30.579
Plenty of men in this place

22:30.631 --> 22:33.666
have done plenty of stupid shit

22:33.668 --> 22:36.719
just to hear Charles Vane
call him a proper pirate.

22:36.754 --> 22:39.255
Though might be you're the only one

22:39.307 --> 22:41.090
who actually made a career of it.

23:22.767 --> 23:25.384
Heard you refused your
water ration yesterday.

23:28.189 --> 23:30.265
I wish you wouldn't do that.

23:31.275 --> 23:32.975
Flint's only granting me the ration

23:33.027 --> 23:37.027
as a fuck you to prove
that power's in his hands.

23:38.399 --> 23:39.448
I won't give him the satisfaction.

23:39.483 --> 23:40.733
It doesn't matter.

23:40.735 --> 23:42.620
And I don't like how it looks,

23:43.704 --> 23:47.323
me having a full ration
while they waste away,

23:47.375 --> 23:48.907
and then asking them to trust me.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.058
It doesn't matter.

23:52.830 --> 23:55.080
Those men, all of them,

23:55.082 --> 23:57.228
even the ones left out,

23:58.252 --> 23:59.918
they trust you to be able
to stand up to the captain

23:59.971 --> 24:01.887
when the time comes.

24:01.922 --> 24:03.806
And you can't do that
if he's got his strength

24:03.841 --> 24:05.020
and you don't.

24:07.428 --> 24:09.731
That has been the problem all along.

24:10.931 --> 24:12.598
That's the thing gates never understood

24:12.650 --> 24:14.483
and a thing you never understood.

24:17.321 --> 24:19.571
You cannot decide to follow a man like that

24:19.607 --> 24:22.781
and then pick and choose when you deny him.

24:24.111 --> 24:26.161
It's your job to deny him.

24:32.620 --> 24:34.852
If I challenge him directly,

24:35.756 --> 24:38.123
he and I will be at such
extreme odds in front of the men,

24:38.175 --> 24:39.258
it will be the end of this crew

24:39.293 --> 24:40.602
one way or another,

24:41.629 --> 24:44.129
and I can't allow that to happen.

24:44.131 --> 24:46.598
So, once again,

24:46.634 --> 24:50.302
he is able to conjure
the reality he desires

24:50.304 --> 24:52.221
just as it was in Charlestown.

24:52.273 --> 24:53.806
And just as it was in that storm.

24:53.808 --> 24:57.808
There is no denying a man
with that kind of power.

24:59.196 --> 25:00.479
What are you talking about?

25:00.531 --> 25:02.281
You're saying Flint conjured that storm?

25:02.316 --> 25:05.150
He conjured us into it.

25:05.202 --> 25:07.202
And who's more powerful?

25:07.238 --> 25:08.454
The one who made the storm

25:08.489 --> 25:09.488
or the one who convinced us

25:09.490 --> 25:11.614
into battle to defeat it?

25:13.114 --> 25:15.077
A man of his capacities,

25:15.129 --> 25:19.129
his state of mind becomes reality.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.084
We are subject to it.

25:22.136 --> 25:23.919
And right now his state of mind's so dark,

25:23.971 --> 25:25.884
it threatens to kill us all.

25:27.141 --> 25:29.811
Take your rations.

25:30.928 --> 25:32.644
I mean it.

25:35.433 --> 25:37.693
I'm clearheaded, Billy.

25:38.569 --> 25:40.162
I see him.

25:41.772 --> 25:45.074
During that feud with Vane over the fort,

25:45.109 --> 25:46.859
I sat in his cabin and I watched him

25:46.911 --> 25:49.528
turn himself inside out over the idea

25:49.580 --> 25:51.113
that anyone in Nassau would see him

25:51.165 --> 25:52.762
as the villain in that story.

25:53.951 --> 25:56.499
Well, now he's the greatest
villain in the new world.

25:57.538 --> 25:59.378
We all see it. We all
follow him because of it.

25:59.971 --> 26:01.984
I think it's torture for him,

26:03.761 --> 26:05.844
and I think the only way
he can imagine it stopping

26:05.880 --> 26:08.597
is when there are no more
of us left to witness it.

26:12.553 --> 26:14.436
Fucking thieves!

26:18.025 --> 26:21.352
You both stand accused
of a crime most serious.

26:22.382 --> 26:26.382
Theft of food held in
reserve in a time such as this

26:27.318 --> 26:30.665
is a betrayal of trust
of the most profound sort.

26:31.906 --> 26:34.072
The penalty for such a betrayal is,

26:34.125 --> 26:37.910
by necessity, extreme.

26:37.912 --> 26:40.245
You were both charged with keeping watch

26:40.297 --> 26:43.248
over what little remains
of our food stores.

26:43.300 --> 26:46.069
A full day's rations are now gone,

26:46.921 --> 26:50.060
yet each of you accuses
the other of the crime.

26:52.927 --> 26:56.927
As your quartermaster, as your friend,

26:58.599 --> 27:02.518
I'm going to implore you one last time,

27:02.570 --> 27:06.342
whichever of you is the
guilty man, to confess.

27:07.274 --> 27:09.274
Repair in some small part

27:09.326 --> 27:10.909
the trust you've breached
with your brothers.

27:10.945 --> 27:14.112
I swear, I wouldn't have done such a thing.

27:14.165 --> 27:16.949
I don't have it in me.

27:16.951 --> 27:18.784
Please don't fucking hang me.

27:18.786 --> 27:20.702
Shut the fuck up.

27:20.754 --> 27:22.454
You all seen me these
last few weeks out here.

27:22.456 --> 27:25.624
Never blubbered, never bitched.

27:25.676 --> 27:27.960
I weathered this shit
as well as any of you.

27:27.962 --> 27:29.928
So don't fucking tell me I'd do something

27:29.964 --> 27:31.547
this fucking cowardly

27:31.599 --> 27:33.382
and then blame it on a
sniveling shit like this one.

27:33.434 --> 27:35.050
One of us is a liar, all right,

27:35.102 --> 27:37.269
but it sure as fuck isn't me.

27:56.123 --> 27:57.539
Oh, shit.

28:01.745 --> 28:03.662
Captain.

28:03.714 --> 28:06.192
Thank you. Oh, dear god,
thank you for seeing the truth.

28:11.805 --> 28:15.757
Wait. No.

28:18.012 --> 28:20.229
No. Wait.

28:20.264 --> 28:23.765
You need to say something.

28:28.522 --> 28:32.265
Don't do this. I ain't done nothing.
I swear it.

28:46.373 --> 28:49.124
Forgive me.

29:08.562 --> 29:10.529
Does everyone understand?

29:15.569 --> 29:17.452
Does anyone have anything to say?

29:32.086 --> 29:35.253
If you're not strong enough
to do what needs to be done,

29:37.174 --> 29:38.590
then I'll do it for you.

32:19.586 --> 32:21.887
What the hell is that?

32:21.922 --> 32:23.305
It is a balance.

32:23.340 --> 32:24.673
Yeah, what's it here for?

32:27.144 --> 32:29.610
There is no point in delaying any longer.

32:30.597 --> 32:34.399
There will be no more
merchants, no more exchanges.

32:34.434 --> 32:36.154
Sooner or later,
that fleet will be upon us.

32:38.272 --> 32:40.272
Sooner or later,
it will be time for you and I

32:40.274 --> 32:42.274
to go our separate ways.

32:42.326 --> 32:44.442
It would be wise if we are prepared

32:44.495 --> 32:46.661
and our shares are split evenly.

32:48.782 --> 32:50.282
Tell me why.

32:53.086 --> 32:54.744
We've been through this.

32:54.796 --> 32:56.538
No, you told me why

32:56.590 --> 32:58.623
I wouldn't stay here with you.

32:58.675 --> 33:00.689
But you ain't said why
you won't come with me.

33:02.259 --> 33:05.859
If we lose, if we have to leave this place,

33:06.794 --> 33:08.633
why are you so set on staying?

33:08.685 --> 33:10.485
Why the fuck could you
want to live in a world

33:10.521 --> 33:13.138
that says that fat pig on the
beach is a man to be respected?

33:15.142 --> 33:17.025
A world that wants its sons to become that?

33:23.150 --> 33:25.200
When I was very small,

33:25.235 --> 33:28.320
I would sneak out of the slave
quarters at night to the main house.

33:31.124 --> 33:33.158
I would stand outside
the window to the parlor.

33:35.662 --> 33:39.285
I would stand amongst the heat and the bugs

33:39.378 --> 33:41.750
and the filth on my toes to see inside.

33:44.671 --> 33:48.620
Inside that house was
a little girl my age...

33:50.510 --> 33:52.594
With the most beautiful skin.

33:55.232 --> 33:57.649
I watched her dance while
her father played music

33:57.684 --> 33:59.128
and her mother sewed.

34:02.522 --> 34:06.024
I watched her read and eat

34:06.076 --> 34:09.245
and sing and sleep,

34:11.081 --> 34:15.081
kept safe and warm and clean by her father.

34:18.672 --> 34:20.956
My father.

34:25.128 --> 34:27.045
The things it took to
make that room possible,

34:27.047 --> 34:29.047
they were awful things.

34:29.349 --> 34:32.077
But inside that room was peace.

34:34.304 --> 34:35.937
That is what home is to me.

34:38.475 --> 34:41.614
When you and I began,
you did not choose me.

34:42.696 --> 34:44.562
Something that lives inside you

34:44.563 --> 34:46.496
beyond choice made it so,

34:47.117 --> 34:48.565
so I know you understand

34:48.568 --> 34:50.902
how this lives beyond choice for me, too.

34:53.373 --> 34:57.373
Our roads are going to diverge.

35:01.164 --> 35:03.999
Let it be now so we may
not live in fear of it.

35:16.013 --> 35:18.596
Yeah.

35:56.019 --> 35:58.436
You should stay...

35:58.472 --> 36:00.472
To see it be divided evenly.

36:02.859 --> 36:05.310
I trust you.

36:31.252 --> 36:32.368
Maybe you were right.

36:35.509 --> 36:38.009
Maybe he is dangerous to us in this state.

36:40.347 --> 36:42.564
And maybe there is nothing we can do

36:42.599 --> 36:46.599
to stop him right now
without shattering the crew.

36:46.770 --> 36:50.770
But if he kills another
innocent man in this crew

36:51.358 --> 36:54.826
to make a point, or tries to...

36:58.599 --> 37:00.171
I'm going to do something about it.

37:03.870 --> 37:07.288
So I suggest you get this
situation under control

37:07.340 --> 37:09.413
before that happens.

37:13.713 --> 37:16.381
I told you, eh? I just don't see a way.

37:16.433 --> 37:18.105
Gates figured it out.

37:19.886 --> 37:21.523
The Barlow woman figured it out.

37:21.559 --> 37:23.217
He listened to them,

37:24.441 --> 37:26.107
altered his plans when they told him to.

37:26.143 --> 37:27.679
It's possible.

37:29.007 --> 37:33.007
The difference is he saw them as his equal.

37:34.951 --> 37:38.951
He respected them that way,
so he was willing to listen.

37:42.656 --> 37:44.790
You need to find a way to do the same.

37:49.082 --> 37:51.299
Both of those people ended up dead.

39:01.988 --> 39:03.093
When I lost Thomas,

39:04.991 --> 39:06.324
I raged.

39:06.326 --> 39:10.218
I was distraught.

39:10.270 --> 39:11.412
I wept.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.269
But with you...

39:17.003 --> 39:19.420
I'm ruined over you.

39:28.481 --> 39:30.787
When I first met you, you were so...

39:32.736 --> 39:34.639
Unformed.

39:36.366 --> 39:40.366
And then I spoke and bade
you cast aside your shame,

39:41.361 --> 39:44.779
and Captain Flint was
born into the world...

39:44.831 --> 39:46.998
the part of you that always existed

39:47.033 --> 39:50.367
yet never were you willing to
allow into the light of day.

39:51.421 --> 39:54.240
I was mistress to you when you needed love.

39:56.426 --> 39:59.625
I was wife to you when
you needed understanding.

40:01.264 --> 40:03.514
But first and before all...

40:05.552 --> 40:07.157
I was mother.

40:17.113 --> 40:19.376
I have known you like no other.

40:20.317 --> 40:23.368
So I love you like no other.

40:26.239 --> 40:28.491
I will guide you through it,

40:29.826 --> 40:33.067
but at its end is where you must leave me.

40:34.407 --> 40:37.877
At its end is where you will
find the peace that eludes you,

40:38.471 --> 40:41.598
and at its end lies the
answer you refuse to see.

41:06.446 --> 41:08.279
It's hard to tell how big she is.

41:08.281 --> 41:10.114
There isn't much above the surface.

41:10.116 --> 41:12.283
But it hasn't moved since we spotted it,

41:12.335 --> 41:13.785
so it's almost certainly dead.

41:13.787 --> 41:16.287
Whale carcass.

41:16.339 --> 41:19.207
That's a week's worth of water.

41:19.259 --> 41:21.459
Food times three.

41:23.296 --> 41:26.848
They float when they rot. After they rot.

41:31.638 --> 41:34.472
Make ready the launch.

41:34.474 --> 41:36.140
It's a waste of energy.

41:36.142 --> 41:38.476
Make ready the launch.

41:46.119 --> 41:48.569
I'm going to see it myself.

41:48.621 --> 41:51.406
There's too much at stake.

41:51.458 --> 41:53.157
You gonna row out there on your own?

41:56.413 --> 41:58.746
I'm one of two men who've
been on full rations

41:58.798 --> 42:01.966
for the last few days.

42:02.001 --> 42:06.001
You're the other. Let's go.

42:36.086 --> 42:37.835
I stole it from you.

42:38.362 --> 42:39.420
What?

42:42.125 --> 42:43.674
The Urca gold.

42:50.266 --> 42:51.716
I told you we were deceived

42:51.718 --> 42:54.118
about its having been
recovered by the Spanish.

42:55.105 --> 42:56.996
Wasn't entirely true.

42:58.475 --> 42:59.557
You were deceived.

43:01.978 --> 43:03.394
I built the lie...

43:07.033 --> 43:08.154
Enlisted the scouts,

43:08.179 --> 43:10.379
arranged the sale of the
information to Captain Rackham.

43:13.873 --> 43:15.540
I conceived it all.

43:18.211 --> 43:19.293
You know, I've had my fill

43:19.329 --> 43:20.711
of hearing you go on about this crew

43:20.747 --> 43:23.414
being too weak to keep up with you.

43:24.968 --> 43:26.551
Some of them may be weaker than you,

43:26.586 --> 43:28.396
some of them may be less smart,

43:29.422 --> 43:32.148
but don't you for a second
believe I fit that description.

43:33.810 --> 43:36.614
Whatever happens out
here, one thing is certain.

43:37.931 --> 43:40.097
You will account for me.

43:43.603 --> 43:45.593
Why are you telling me all this?

43:46.156 --> 43:48.550
So you can decide...

43:49.943 --> 43:51.366
To fight me,

43:52.445 --> 43:54.278
maybe kill me, and figure out a way

43:54.280 --> 43:56.567
of hauling yourself back to that ship alone

43:57.417 --> 43:58.783
or acknowledge the fact

43:58.785 --> 44:00.670
that you and I would be
a hell of a lot better off

44:00.722 --> 44:02.620
as partners than as rivals.

44:04.257 --> 44:06.958
You conceived all of this?

44:06.960 --> 44:10.761
The cover story, the end game on the jetty?

44:10.797 --> 44:13.097
Waiting for the scouts to return?

44:15.301 --> 44:16.851
Yes.

44:31.317 --> 44:33.901
What did you do with your share?

44:37.323 --> 44:38.990
I gave up my claim to it.

44:42.996 --> 44:44.829
Why did you do that?

44:48.835 --> 44:50.384
Because I saw no way to hold it

44:50.420 --> 44:52.503
and remain a part of this crew.

44:55.308 --> 44:57.411
And without these men,

44:59.145 --> 45:01.479
all I am is an invalid.

45:30.510 --> 45:33.544
Oh, god.

45:33.596 --> 45:36.881
Oh, it stinks.

45:36.883 --> 45:39.350
Oh...

45:40.687 --> 45:43.054
Oh, it's long gone.

45:43.106 --> 45:44.722
Oh, we can't eat that.

45:48.605 --> 45:49.904
Let's head back to the ship.

46:28.685 --> 46:29.984
We can eat those.

48:39.282 --> 48:40.448
Fuck!

49:14.150 --> 49:15.349
Again?

49:55.975 --> 49:57.975
What happened out there?

50:01.147 --> 50:03.311
Progress.

50:06.152 --> 50:08.402
How can you know for sure?

50:11.324 --> 50:13.991
Because I'm still alive, I suppose.

50:58.337 --> 51:00.704
Sails on the horizon!

51:12.602 --> 51:13.801
It would appear, sir,

51:13.853 --> 51:15.719
that your information
is less than complete.

51:19.642 --> 51:21.558
Perhaps you should ask this one who it is.

51:21.611 --> 51:25.145
There are masts at the mouth of the harbor.

51:25.197 --> 51:27.064
Appear to be in a firing line.

51:31.319 --> 51:32.985
Do you recognize any of their banners?

51:44.750 --> 51:46.083
What did you see?

51:46.085 --> 51:47.251
North... northeast.

51:47.303 --> 51:48.585
Just cresting the horizon.

51:48.638 --> 51:49.753
How many ships?

51:49.755 --> 51:52.640
Looks to be eight, maybe nine.

51:52.675 --> 51:54.925
Three hours, give or
take, till they're near.

51:54.977 --> 51:56.260
Let's get the men aboard ship.

52:17.500 --> 52:18.949
That formation ensures

52:19.001 --> 52:20.701
that any approach in the harbor mouth

52:20.753 --> 52:23.454
will result in significant
damage to our fleet.

52:23.506 --> 52:25.422
Apparently, Captain Teach

52:25.458 --> 52:27.708
is every bit the tactician they say he is.

52:27.760 --> 52:30.044
What are you suggesting?

52:30.096 --> 52:32.296
That we withdraw?

52:32.298 --> 52:34.715
I'm suggesting that I see no obvious means

52:34.767 --> 52:36.550
by which we can reclaim Nassau town,

52:36.602 --> 52:37.801
not without risking the loss

52:37.803 --> 52:41.605
of significant assets
of his majesty's Navy.

52:43.609 --> 52:45.809
Then I'll go to the beach myself.

52:45.861 --> 52:47.728
Beg pardon?

52:47.780 --> 52:49.530
I will have a launch
ferry me to the sand alone,

52:49.565 --> 52:50.864
and I will make the pardon address.

52:50.900 --> 52:53.297
- It is out of the question.
- Why?

52:53.332 --> 52:55.285
Because my charge is to ensure
this endeavor's safety and yours

52:55.321 --> 52:57.988
and I'll not answer to
a plan that reckless.

52:57.990 --> 52:59.156
It shouldn't be you.

53:03.379 --> 53:06.663
If you send someone else
to read the pardon address,

53:06.665 --> 53:09.883
someone known to the men on
that beach, it might work.

53:09.919 --> 53:11.251
Someone have her removed.
I don't have time for this.

53:11.303 --> 53:13.220
Hold... hold on. What are you suggesting?

53:13.255 --> 53:14.805
That you go to read the address?

53:14.840 --> 53:16.090
No, it can't be me either.

53:16.142 --> 53:18.425
I have too many enemies
between here and that beach.

53:18.477 --> 53:20.427
Then who?

53:20.479 --> 53:21.562
Him.

53:23.983 --> 53:25.065
Half the men in that bay

53:25.101 --> 53:27.651
have sailed under him
at one point or another.

53:27.686 --> 53:29.486
They respect him

53:29.522 --> 53:31.238
as much if not more than any other man

53:31.273 --> 53:32.773
that's sailed under the black.

53:32.825 --> 53:35.993
They'd Grant him passage
under a flag of truce,

53:36.028 --> 53:37.745
and they'd listen to what he had to say.

53:40.666 --> 53:43.167
And you don't give a shit
if he dies in the process.

54:14.567 --> 54:16.283
Why are we letting him pass?

54:16.318 --> 54:20.318
Shoot on that man and
under the flag of truce

54:20.706 --> 54:22.906
and the half of Nassau that remember him

54:22.908 --> 54:24.074
as the foundation of this place

54:24.126 --> 54:26.215
will rebel against the other half.

54:27.496 --> 54:30.414
Whatever's about to happen,
there's no stopping it now.

54:59.829 --> 55:03.113
In the name of the governor
of New Providence Island,

55:03.115 --> 55:04.948
the Honorable Woodes Rogers,

55:05.000 --> 55:08.669
"the time has come to bring a
wayward child back into the fold,"

55:08.704 --> 55:12.623
an island that rejected its parent empire,

55:12.675 --> 55:14.541
but that must long for the embrace

55:14.593 --> 55:17.211
of civilization once again.

55:17.263 --> 55:20.297
Be it proclaimed that
any man on this island

55:20.349 --> 55:22.466
who will accept that embrace,

55:22.518 --> 55:25.135
who will renounce violence
against the crown,

55:25.137 --> 55:27.330
who will renounce piracy,

55:28.307 --> 55:30.474
that man will be offered

55:30.476 --> 55:34.194
a full, complete, and unqualified pardon.

55:34.987 --> 55:37.261
No matter what you've done,

55:37.650 --> 55:40.624
no matter how irredeemable
you believe it to be,

55:40.886 --> 55:43.320
your king and your governor

55:43.322 --> 55:45.372
wish to offer you a clean slate,

55:45.407 --> 55:48.575
a new beginning here in Nassau.

55:49.078 --> 55:51.530
All of you, that is, but one.

55:52.464 --> 55:56.464
One so committed to disorder and chaos

55:57.241 --> 55:59.720
that his presence is incompatible

55:59.755 --> 56:01.873
with civilized society.

56:02.250 --> 56:04.926
Be it known there shall be a bounty

56:04.961 --> 56:06.848
of 10,000 pounds sterling

56:07.346 --> 56:09.513
for the capture of the pirate Charles Vane,

56:09.565 --> 56:12.015
"dead or alive."

56:43.766 --> 56:45.166
What the fuck's he doing?

56:51.023 --> 56:52.522
Captain.
