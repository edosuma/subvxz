19:10.048 --> 19:11.683
Yeah. Yeah.

19:11.683 --> 19:13.185
That thing is absorbent.

19:13.185 --> 19:15.053
Well, I don't want you
to feel weird.

19:15.053 --> 19:16.288
How can I make
this better?

19:16.288 --> 19:18.424
You-- Don't--
Just forget it.

19:18.424 --> 19:19.358
Seriously. I'll get over it.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.993
Well, what if I take
my clothes off right now?

19:21.993 --> 19:23.094
What? Why?

19:23.094 --> 19:26.064
It'll even things out.
I'm happy to do it.
Oh, Jen,

19:26.064 --> 19:27.065
you don't have to--Please.

19:27.065 --> 19:29.468
I've stripped for a lot
dumber reasons than this.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.970
Honey, this is
my problem. It's-- Well--

19:31.970 --> 19:33.405
Wow. There you go.

Thanks again, you guys,
for inviting us.

19:51.557 --> 19:52.658
Oh, we loved
having you.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.760
And thanks for picking up
the tab for our weekend.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.162
It would've been fun
even if it wasn't free.

19:57.162 --> 19:59.865
But it was free.
Totally free.

19:59.865 --> 20:04.203
You're gonna help me get out of
this time-share thing, right?
