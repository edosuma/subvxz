a way better job at.

-No.

we have to watch this right now.

-Ethan, please! No!
-This is not a toss.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.460
-This is not getting thrown away.
-We have to get this done today!

-Right there.

He wouldn't let this go,
he was like a dog with a bath mat.

-Dog with a bath mat?
-Yeah, it's a thing.

10:52.443 --> 10:55.571
My dog Scoby would attack them
all the time, it's a thing all dogs do.

People say it, it's a thing,
you're absolutely right.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.867
Is there food in the mat?

10:59.950 --> 11:01.160
Of course there's not food in the mat.

They like ripping it apart
for some reason.

they would be so into a mat.

No, not at all. It was him, if anything.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.393
I think it was me
because I too  am concerned

What happened to the Saab?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.926
Too many parking tickets.
It was cheaper to get a new car.

Or you can just try parking legally.

OK. Well, I...
I am going on a date with her.

like a bistro person? Right?

Well...

19:56.278 --> 19:58.906
to our relationship hitting rock bottom.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.242
[clinking]

20:06.121 --> 20:07.497
-Oh.
-Oh.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.917
Age does not make that better.

20:10.959 --> 20:11.919
No.

20:26.099 --> 20:29.561
So your friend just buys a new car
every time one gets impounded?

20:29.645 --> 20:32.356
-Yeah, isn't that nuts?
-Is she a diplomat?

20:32.439 --> 20:33.690
She's an unemployed actress.

20:33.774 --> 20:34.816
[she chuckles]

20:36.568 --> 20:38.403
I had a really nice time tonight.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.988
I had a nice time too.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.741
Thank you.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.215
Ta-dah!

21:00.342 --> 21:02.886
-What's going on?
-Uh...

21:03.553 --> 21:04.680
I'm just--

21:05.097 --> 21:07.557
I'm worried that this could...

21:08.141 --> 21:09.434
get complicated.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.188
-Complicated?
-Yeah.

21:13.647 --> 21:18.110
I just-- I usually date, like
simpler women, and you're like wise enough

21:18.193 --> 21:19.403
to see what's wrong with me.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.488
[chuckles] So you're calling me old?

21:21.571 --> 21:24.658
Er...I feel like the more I say the...

21:25.575 --> 21:28.245
digger a hole I'm gonna... deep.

21:28.328 --> 21:29.871
The digger a hole you're gonna deep?

21:29.955 --> 21:31.790
I just-- Let's just leave it at...

21:32.291 --> 21:33.542
I could...

21:34.501 --> 21:35.502
like you.

21:35.585 --> 21:39.089
Wow, you really know how
to sweep a girl off her feet.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.606
That was better.

22:06.616 --> 22:07.951
[both sigh]

22:08.952 --> 22:10.746
Was it the best lay you ever had?

22:10.829 --> 22:11.663
[both chuckle]

22:11.747 --> 22:12.914
Yes, it was.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.500
-Can you get me some water?
-Yes, of course.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.715
-Oh, sorry.
-That's okay

22:27.220 --> 22:28.221
What's up!

22:28.305 --> 22:29.931
-Jesus!
-Pussy.

22:32.392 --> 22:33.477
Good night.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.438
Okay, good-- Yeah, good night!

22:38.648 --> 22:39.483
Wow.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.236
-Thank you.
-Uh, yeah.

22:44.863 --> 22:48.200
-I just met your son.
-Isn't he the sweetest?

22:48.283 --> 22:50.118
Yeah, no, he's super sweet.

22:53.455 --> 22:54.373
God, you--

22:54.790 --> 22:56.291
You got a lot of B-52s.

22:56.375 --> 23:01.213
[chuckles] Yes. I have no idea why I have
Fred Schneider's solo album.

23:01.296 --> 23:02.339
[Ethan laughs]

23:02.422 --> 23:05.467
[mimicking Fred Schneider]
Why did I buy this funky little purchase?

23:05.967 --> 23:08.428
-Is that your Fred Schneider?
-Yeah.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.556
[mimicking Fred Schneider]
Why did I buy this funky little purchase?

23:11.640 --> 23:13.600
-We have our own Freds.
-Okay.

23:15.519 --> 23:16.645
Oh, my God.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.899
We're now in the swing section.

23:20.982 --> 23:24.778
Look at this. What do we got here?
We got some Big Bad Voodoo Daddy,

23:24.861 --> 23:26.947
we've got some Cherry Poppin Daddies.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.408
-Lots of daddies.
-You know what, whatever, man.

23:29.491 --> 23:33.328
Big Bad Voodoo Daddy played
the Super Bowl Halftime Show.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.497
That was a big deal.

23:36.289 --> 23:37.541
Okay, well.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.585
This really brings me back.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.629
Sorry.

23:42.712 --> 23:44.423
I don't mean to be nostalgic.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.758
Well, it's hard not to be.

23:47.509 --> 23:51.304
Our lives were fully intertwined
until a year ago.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.561
I've known you my entire adult life...

23:58.603 --> 24:01.398
and now I'm not completely clear
what I'm...

24:01.481 --> 24:04.651
supposed to be once all this is gone.

24:04.734 --> 24:05.652
You know?

24:07.279 --> 24:08.405
Yeah, I know.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.312
[both groan]

24:45.025 --> 24:46.026
[Sam] Oh.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.655
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.450
I haven't had sex in a year.

24:59.706 --> 25:00.540
Okay.

25:14.429 --> 25:15.514
[Ethan sighs]

25:19.559 --> 25:20.810
Guess this is it.

25:23.396 --> 25:24.731
Yeah, that was it.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.234
[cellphone buzzes]

25:36.034 --> 25:36.910
Hello.

25:39.454 --> 25:40.914
J-Jon?

25:42.207 --> 25:44.292
Uh, what? I would--

26:13.780 --> 26:15.824
It's your mess, you clean it up.
