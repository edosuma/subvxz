[moans] Okay, all right, all
right, all right, that's enough.

37:20.673 --> 37:23.197
[sighing]

37:23.328 --> 37:25.112
You're promoted.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.463
I want you
taking over misinformation.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.770
Thank you, sir.

37:30.900 --> 37:33.207
I like what you're doing
with this building collapse.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.165
Not just ground settling.

37:35.296 --> 37:37.646
Make it about construction codes

37:37.777 --> 37:39.387
and-and gas releases.

37:39.518 --> 37:41.955
Okay, yes. Got it. Got it.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.044
And I want you here
at noon tomorrow

37:44.174 --> 37:45.306
-with this shortbread.
-Certainly,

37:45.437 --> 37:46.699
-sir.
-Good.

37:46.829 --> 37:49.441
-Now get the hell out of here.
-Yeah.

37:52.879 --> 37:55.185
So, you've been in
with the Manager?

37:55.316 --> 37:56.665
How do you know?

37:56.796 --> 37:58.798
I recognize that look
on your face.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.453
What happened?

38:04.499 --> 38:06.806
-He promoted me.
-Hmm.

38:06.936 --> 38:08.677
Congratulations.

38:08.808 --> 38:10.810
And regrets.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.257
What does he look like to you?

38:23.388 --> 38:25.433
-The Manager?
-Yeah.

38:25.564 --> 38:27.392
Just like he does to you.

38:27.522 --> 38:29.872
He looks like a monster to me.

38:30.003 --> 38:31.657
How many eyes?

38:32.701 --> 38:34.137
[sniffles]

38:37.097 --> 38:38.577
Five.

38:38.707 --> 38:40.405
-Welcome to the team.
-Am I...

38:40.535 --> 38:43.930
Am I having some kind
of psychotic breakdown?

38:44.060 --> 38:45.061
[chuckles softly]

38:45.192 --> 38:47.368
Oh, absolutely.

38:48.891 --> 38:50.328
[sighs]

38:56.812 --> 38:59.032
[laughs]

39:01.991 --> 39:04.037
-What's going on?
-Shh.

39:04.167 --> 39:05.952
[whispering]:
He's working on Jessica.

39:06.082 --> 39:08.084
You know, the survivor who was
staying at her friend's place?

39:08.215 --> 39:09.303
Okay.

39:09.434 --> 39:10.217
BEN [whispering]:
So, she insists

39:10.348 --> 39:12.350
that the angel was white.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.742
[indistinct chatter
in next room]

39:13.873 --> 39:15.788
Has he hypnotized
the others yet?

39:15.918 --> 39:17.833
We haven't gotten agreements
from the other ones yet.

39:17.964 --> 39:20.619
But there's something else.

39:20.749 --> 39:23.752
-What?
-Something you should hear.

39:26.102 --> 39:27.626
All right, you're doing great.
I just...

39:27.756 --> 39:30.106
I just want to go back to, uh,

39:30.237 --> 39:31.673
something that you said earlier.

39:31.804 --> 39:34.459
-You remember the call.
-Yes.

39:34.589 --> 39:37.244
And what time
did the call come in?

39:37.375 --> 39:39.942
Around 1:10 a.m.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.858
And what did you hear
the woman on the line say?

39:42.989 --> 39:44.251
"Get out now."

39:44.382 --> 39:46.209
Good. And then

39:46.340 --> 39:47.646
you heard her say
something else?

39:47.776 --> 39:49.822
-Yes.
-What was it?

39:49.952 --> 39:52.041
She said she had a message.

39:52.172 --> 39:55.175
A message for David.

39:57.090 --> 39:58.221
You said

39:58.352 --> 39:59.614
she spoke in a foreign language

39:59.745 --> 40:00.615
you didn't understand.

40:00.746 --> 40:02.487
I was wrong.

40:02.617 --> 40:04.663
I didn't know
anybody named David,

40:04.793 --> 40:06.447
so it didn't make sense to me.

40:06.578 --> 40:08.231
What was the message?

40:09.232 --> 40:11.409
"Don't trust her."

40:13.411 --> 40:15.195
KURT:
Is that it?

40:15.325 --> 40:17.066
No. She said,

40:17.197 --> 40:19.852
"Don't trust your sister."

40:23.203 --> 40:25.161
[whispers]:
So, you don't have a sister?

40:25.292 --> 40:26.902
No.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.079
You don't think
this is about...?

40:30.210 --> 40:31.820
Sister Andrea?

40:32.821 --> 40:34.562
Maybe.

40:35.650 --> 40:37.173
[whispering]:
This is crazy.

40:38.174 --> 40:40.525
I mean, she gets a call
about you from the lamb-lady

40:40.655 --> 40:42.178
prior to the building's
collapse,

40:42.309 --> 40:44.093
and she doesn't know
that you're gonna be involved

40:44.224 --> 40:45.791
in the aftermath?

40:45.921 --> 40:48.184
-I know.
-I mean, this is

40:48.315 --> 40:51.927
more than the subconscious
warning her.

40:52.058 --> 40:54.060
[whispering]: Yeah, it's beyond
impending doom syndrome.

40:54.190 --> 40:55.583
DAVID:
Then what is it?

40:55.714 --> 40:57.019
Prophecy?

40:57.150 --> 40:58.673
About Sister Andrea?

41:11.381 --> 41:12.818
[bell tolling]

41:15.864 --> 41:17.170
What's going on?

41:17.300 --> 41:19.172
Turns out, when something
is that convenient,

41:19.302 --> 41:22.044
it is not prophecy.

41:22.175 --> 41:23.655
What are we talking about?

41:23.785 --> 41:25.439
She wasn't in the building.

41:25.570 --> 41:26.788
What?

41:26.919 --> 41:28.616
BEN: Yeah. We did
a little online hunting,

41:28.747 --> 41:31.358
and turns out that she was
subletting at another building

41:31.489 --> 41:34.187
and then she slipped in
with the survivors.

41:34.317 --> 41:35.580
It's a type
of Munchausen syndrome,

41:35.710 --> 41:37.930
wanting to be the victim
of a disaster.

41:38.974 --> 41:40.585
Why the warning about me?

41:41.977 --> 41:43.979
Let's find out.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.721
KRISTEN: Thank you
for coming in, Jessica.

41:46.852 --> 41:48.462
Of course, yeah.

41:48.593 --> 41:51.465
-Just a few last things.
-Anything to help.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.772
How are the other survivors?

41:53.902 --> 41:55.208
Good.

41:55.338 --> 41:57.471
How long did you know Lois?

41:57.602 --> 41:59.865
Lois? Not long.
Just through law school.

41:59.995 --> 42:01.431
Hmm. And it was her apartment?

42:01.562 --> 42:03.433
JESSICA:
Yes. We were up late

42:03.564 --> 42:06.393
studying, and I had
a bit too much to drink,

42:06.524 --> 42:08.613
so she let me stay the night.
[chuckles softly]

42:08.743 --> 42:11.485
You know what's odd?

42:11.616 --> 42:13.269
We have no record

42:13.400 --> 42:16.534
of you being in law school
with Lois.

42:17.578 --> 42:18.536
Really?

42:18.666 --> 42:20.668
Well, I was.

42:21.669 --> 42:22.801
BEN:
What we do have

42:22.931 --> 42:25.412
is a record
of you working as a temp.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.371
Yes. Oddly,
I can be in law school

42:28.502 --> 42:30.156
and work as a temp
at the same time.

42:30.286 --> 42:32.027
Why are you being so hostile?

42:32.158 --> 42:33.812
KRISTEN: Last year you were
working as an office assistant

42:33.942 --> 42:36.118
at a psychiatrist's office.

42:36.249 --> 42:39.252
421 East Drayden Street,
Suite 3C.

42:39.382 --> 42:41.689
Working for a psychiatrist

42:41.820 --> 42:44.431
named Leland Townsend.

42:51.656 --> 42:54.615
Have you ever noticed
people are getting meaner?

42:56.051 --> 42:57.879
They yell at each other more.

42:58.010 --> 43:00.186
They hit each other
on airplanes.

43:00.316 --> 43:02.101
There are more violent crimes.

43:02.231 --> 43:04.756
I mean, you must have noticed.
It's all over the news.

43:06.192 --> 43:07.367
Do you know what it means,

43:07.497 --> 43:10.805
all this anger and hate?

43:14.592 --> 43:17.769
It means your team is losing.

43:22.077 --> 43:25.080
That doom you feel.

43:26.647 --> 43:28.518
It's justified.

43:38.180 --> 43:40.400
So, she was...

43:40.530 --> 43:43.490
lying about seeing this woman
with the lamb.

43:43.621 --> 43:46.232
About being saved by her.

43:46.362 --> 43:47.799
Yes, but the others were not.

43:49.322 --> 43:51.890
I'm afraid this casts doubt
on all of the accounts.

43:52.020 --> 43:53.543
That doesn't make any sense.

43:53.674 --> 43:56.155
Whoa, whoa,
I'm definitely not team angel,

43:56.285 --> 43:58.157
but just because
one person is lying

43:58.287 --> 43:59.680
doesn't make them all
suspicious.

43:59.811 --> 44:02.378
KORECKI:
The Causis Sanctorum

44:02.509 --> 44:03.989
has been very clear
in its decision.

44:04.119 --> 44:05.991
Why is the Church afraid
of a Black angel?

44:11.605 --> 44:13.563
I think it's time we moved on.

44:14.390 --> 44:16.479
You already have

44:16.610 --> 44:18.220
your next assessment.

44:20.614 --> 44:22.137
Candice Berganza.

44:22.268 --> 44:23.791
15-year-old girl.
Demonic possession

44:23.922 --> 44:25.358
and infestation.

44:25.488 --> 44:27.012
She's been eating glass,

44:27.142 --> 44:29.667
and her bedroom
has been making demonic noises.

44:30.711 --> 44:34.367
Well, that sounds much safer.

44:34.497 --> 44:36.369
[door opens]

44:36.499 --> 44:38.110
[door closes]

44:46.684 --> 44:48.511
[door opens]

44:54.866 --> 44:56.868
[door closes]

44:58.870 --> 45:00.828
We have made our decision.

45:00.959 --> 45:03.570
We ask that Sister Andrea leave

45:03.701 --> 45:05.267
-till we have discussed it.
-Father,

45:05.398 --> 45:07.139
I'd like to be clear

45:07.269 --> 45:09.358
why these charges are being
brought against Sister Andrea.

45:09.489 --> 45:10.838
GRAY:
Certainly.

45:11.839 --> 45:13.580
-That gentleman.
-Father, that may be

45:13.711 --> 45:15.103
the original accusation.

45:15.234 --> 45:18.454
But Sister Andrea
has proved herself undependable.

45:18.585 --> 45:19.673
I see demons, too.

45:21.414 --> 45:23.851
-Excuse me?
-I see demons, too.

45:23.982 --> 45:27.028
In fact, I see one right now.

45:27.159 --> 45:28.856
David, don't. We need you here.

45:28.987 --> 45:30.684
I see a demon right now.

45:30.815 --> 45:33.556
There.
Sitting next to Leland Townsend.

45:33.687 --> 45:36.734
David, come on.
Stop holding this grudge.

45:36.864 --> 45:38.344
Father,

45:38.474 --> 45:40.346
if Sister Andrea
is a liability to this parish,

45:40.476 --> 45:41.869
then I am, too.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.828
Everything she's seen,

45:43.958 --> 45:45.481
I have seen.

45:45.612 --> 45:48.963
You've seen demons
consorting with the cardinal?

45:51.009 --> 45:52.097
Yes.

45:53.272 --> 45:56.449
Father, you understand
this is blasphemy?

45:56.579 --> 45:59.147
I understand that all of us
struggle with evil.

46:01.019 --> 46:04.544
To see the cardinal consorting,
then struggling with a demon

46:04.674 --> 46:06.894
is not blasphemy.

46:07.025 --> 46:08.766
-It is human.
-KATAGAS: But that

46:08.896 --> 46:10.855
is not what Sister Andrea saw.

46:10.985 --> 46:12.726
-She did not see him struggle.
-DAVID: Because

46:12.857 --> 46:14.815
she only saw the beginning and
not the end of the encounter.

46:14.946 --> 46:16.817
-David.
-Please, Sister.

46:16.948 --> 46:18.558
Let the men handle this.

46:18.688 --> 46:21.387
Father, if you're forcing

46:21.517 --> 46:23.171
Sister Andrea to resign,

46:23.302 --> 46:25.478
you must force me
to resign, too.

46:25.608 --> 46:26.958
So just resign.

46:30.396 --> 46:32.267
You must force to resign

46:32.398 --> 46:35.009
one of only three Black priests

46:35.140 --> 46:39.144
ordained by the Catholic Church
this year.

46:45.759 --> 46:47.761
Oh, wow.

46:50.285 --> 46:51.896
[scoffs]

46:58.467 --> 47:00.600
Thank you, David.

47:00.730 --> 47:02.341
Leland didn't look happy.

47:02.471 --> 47:05.213
[chuckles]:
No, he didn't.

47:05.344 --> 47:06.998
Now I need you to go confess.

47:07.128 --> 47:08.216
Why?

47:08.347 --> 47:09.696
You lied.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.872
You never saw a demon
with the cardinal.

47:13.743 --> 47:14.788
I'll go tomorrow.

47:14.919 --> 47:15.963
No, tonight.

47:17.051 --> 47:18.531
And one other thing, David.

47:18.661 --> 47:21.751
-I have to apologize.
-For?

47:21.882 --> 47:24.842
You confided in me
your racial concerns, and...

47:26.278 --> 47:27.583
I dismissed them.

47:27.714 --> 47:28.889
-It's...
-No.

47:29.890 --> 47:32.850
There are certain things
I'm not a good judge of.

47:34.329 --> 47:37.593
I don't see the world
the way you do.

47:37.724 --> 47:41.641
And it's wrong to think
there's only one way.

47:44.513 --> 47:47.038
Sister,

47:47.168 --> 47:49.214
I have doubts.

47:49.344 --> 47:51.259
I know.

47:53.696 --> 47:58.223
I'm not sure my visions
are really from God.

47:58.353 --> 47:59.877
They are.

48:00.007 --> 48:01.661
Even if they've changed?

48:02.662 --> 48:04.882
God changed them.

48:07.362 --> 48:09.190
I wish I had your certainty.

48:09.321 --> 48:10.757
No.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.716
Your doubt

48:13.847 --> 48:16.458
makes your faith stronger.

48:19.070 --> 48:20.767
Now go confess.

48:20.898 --> 48:22.769
[chuckles softly]

48:35.303 --> 48:37.305
[demon snarling]

48:43.703 --> 48:45.313
Boop.
