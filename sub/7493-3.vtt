WEBVTT

00:04.583 --> 00:07.417
Now, if you sign up
at the Wasabi Warrior Academy,

00:07.500 --> 00:10.875
you'll find that, as your sensei,
I like creating an environment

00:10.959 --> 00:12.792
of tranquility and peace.

00:16.375 --> 00:18.000
Roped in another one, people!

00:23.834 --> 00:25.250
Hey, what's going on?

00:25.375 --> 00:26.834
I'll tell you what's going on.

00:26.917 --> 00:29.875
The promotional video I put
on our website is working!

00:30.625 --> 00:32.458
I can't wait to watch us on camera.

00:32.542 --> 00:36.542
Oh, when Donnie at the
hardware depot sees me in my gi,

00:36.625 --> 00:39.959
it's gonna take our relationship
to a whole 'nother level.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.667
He might even stop locking the doors
when he sees me coming.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.458
-
- Oh.

00:47.542 --> 00:48.834
Yo, here we come.

01:08.667 --> 01:09.959
Where were we?

01:10.500 --> 01:11.667
I'm sorry.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.458
I had to make some difficult decisions.

01:15.291 --> 01:16.750
Like cutting us out?

01:16.834 --> 01:18.333
Oh no, that was an easy one.

01:19.583 --> 01:22.583
No, what I struggled with was how
to deal with my "directed by" credit.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.291
But then it just kinda came to me.

01:27.875 --> 01:30.375
This video was directed by me!

01:30.458 --> 01:34.417
Rudy Gillespie... espie...espie...espie.

01:39.625 --> 01:41.417
I trained hard for that video!

01:41.667 --> 01:43.750
My reverse heel kick landed with force

01:43.834 --> 01:46.458
- and precision.
- It landed in your face, Joan.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.667
Is that what happened?

01:56.625 --> 01:58.458
Hey, yo, Jack, have you seen this video?

01:58.542 --> 02:00.500
Uh, yes, I have and I'm not the only one.

02:00.583 --> 02:02.917
Since it came out, I got a free game
at laser tag world.

02:03.959 --> 02:05.875
I'll be on the homecoming float
with the cheerleaders.

02:07.166 --> 02:09.500
And Bob the butcher gave me
this bag of cold cuts.

02:09.583 --> 02:11.667
Whoo! I'll take that.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.041
Joanie Malone-y loves Bob's baloney.

02:15.291 --> 02:17.750
Hey, Jack, got some
potential customers over here

02:17.834 --> 02:19.500
who want to see your video.

02:22.625 --> 02:25.667
If Rudy won't put us in the video,
let's make our own.

02:26.166 --> 02:27.792
With some creative
editing and movie tricks,

02:27.875 --> 02:29.625
- we could look as good as Jack.
- Oh.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.500
I don't need any fancy movie tricks.

02:32.834 --> 02:34.542
I'm the real thing.

02:34.625 --> 02:38.041
Reverse heel kick coming at you!

02:42.208 --> 02:43.750
We need fancy movie tricks.

This is the movie magic
I was talking about.

03:31.834 --> 03:33.625
We've got a green screen
for digital effects,

03:33.709 --> 03:36.417
styrofoam bricks, pre-cut boards
and a breakaway door.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.291
Oh yeah, I've heard about these things.

03:39.583 --> 03:43.125
So this is how Hollywood does it, huh?

03:44.125 --> 03:45.542
-
- Oh-ooh!

03:46.667 --> 03:47.542
Oh!

03:48.375 --> 03:51.250
Got me with the old breakaway stool.

03:51.583 --> 03:54.709
- Oh no, Joan, I think that was--
- I said it was a breakaway stool!

03:56.667 --> 03:58.875
All right, let's get famous, people.

04:00.917 --> 04:03.333

04:33.208 --> 04:35.000

04:53.834 --> 04:55.583

and I still love them.

05:00.750 --> 05:01.709
Izzy!

05:02.500 --> 05:03.667
Dude, what are you doing here?

05:03.750 --> 05:06.250
I thought your band
was on their world tour.

05:06.291 --> 05:08.458
Long story... My jet broke.

05:10.041 --> 05:11.583
Not such a long story.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.875
Jack, look at this!

05:13.959 --> 05:16.834
I invented a game.
You take this hard ball,

05:17.250 --> 05:19.583
you stick your fingers in the holes,

05:19.917 --> 05:21.083
and then...

05:21.583 --> 05:23.709
- you throw it!
-

05:24.333 --> 05:26.166
Izzy, yeah, it is a game.
It's called bowling.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.000
You're supposed to throw
the ball at the pins.

05:28.625 --> 05:31.834
Where's the fun in that?
Pins can't run and scream.

05:33.750 --> 05:38.250
Oh, embarrassing for you two.
Wearing the same clothes.

05:38.625 --> 05:40.291
-
- No.

05:40.417 --> 05:42.959
We're dressed like this because
we just came back from a baseball game.

05:43.041 --> 05:45.625
If the Sea Dogs win tomorrow,
they'll be world champions.

05:45.709 --> 05:47.625
World champions? That's so exciting!

05:47.709 --> 05:49.458
I never thought I'd live to see the day!

05:49.542 --> 05:51.917
- You don't know what baseball is, do you?
- Not a clue!

05:53.208 --> 05:55.417
We're going tomorrow.
You have to come with us, man.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.625
Rudy has an extra ticket.

05:56.709 --> 05:59.375
I do, but I'm bringing a date.

06:00.166 --> 06:03.000
Hey, Jeannie, do you want to
go to the game with me tomorrow?

06:05.917 --> 06:08.208
You know what? It would be my pleasure

06:08.291 --> 06:11.834
to introduce you to America's past...
Alison, do you... want...

06:14.625 --> 06:16.083
- Ticket's all yours.
-

06:20.917 --> 06:23.000
Check it out. Our video's got 65 views.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.834
- All right.
- Oh, sorry I'm late.

06:25.917 --> 06:28.083
I just watched our video 64 times.

06:30.709 --> 06:32.458
Well, at least one person
saw it and liked it.

06:33.250 --> 06:36.083
Wow, their screen name is "gingergenius."

06:36.166 --> 06:37.959
Ooh-hoo.

06:41.458 --> 06:42.333
Yeah, that's me.

06:44.083 --> 06:45.583
Look, we just got a few more views.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.542
And a comment.

06:48.125 --> 06:50.291
"Tiger trio, think you are incredible.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.917
We'd like you to perform at our yucca
valley Cactus Festival this weekend.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.625
- Mayor Duggan."
-

06:58.542 --> 07:00.000
- What a joke.
- Please.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.375
Cactus festival.

07:02.125 --> 07:03.166
- I'm in.
- Me too!

07:03.250 --> 07:04.291
Cactus festival!

07:04.792 --> 07:06.458
Oh, wait, wait, wait... wait a minute!

07:06.542 --> 07:10.250
What happens when we get there and we're
not as good as we look on that video?

07:12.083 --> 07:14.291
We'll just bring them
a little Hollywood movie magic.

07:14.417 --> 07:16.000
As long as they don't
know our props are fake,

07:16.083 --> 07:17.375
they'll think we're the real thing.

07:17.875 --> 07:19.041
He's right.

07:19.125 --> 07:22.583
We're not selling the steak,
we're selling the sizzle.

07:25.375 --> 07:26.959
Well, don't worry about that.

07:27.041 --> 07:29.333
Old Joanie can bring...

07:29.875 --> 07:31.291
the sizzle.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.375
Wow, nice sizzle.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.291
All right, one more out
and we are world champions.

07:49.375 --> 07:51.917
We're gonna get it.
This guy hits like my mother.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
You know, my mother actually played
for the giants back in the day.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.792
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:56.875 --> 07:58.667
She even played when she
was still pregnant with me.

07:58.750 --> 08:01.041
In her last game, she went into
labor as she was rounding first,

08:01.125 --> 08:04.875
slid into second, and I stole third.

08:04.959 --> 08:07.834
This game is amazing. Are you
allowed to talk to the baseballers?

08:07.917 --> 08:08.792
Of course.

08:08.875 --> 08:11.166
Calling stuff out from the stands
is all a part of the experience.

08:11.542 --> 08:14.417
Hey there! You, scratching and spitting.

08:14.542 --> 08:15.417
Yeah?

08:16.375 --> 08:17.792
Not you, Louis.

08:17.875 --> 08:19.959
Him. Number 21!

08:20.041 --> 08:24.125
You've got grass stains on your knickers
and you've lost your other mitten!

08:25.000 --> 08:26.875
No, Izzy, it's not a mitten. It's a glove.

08:26.959 --> 08:28.709
- They use it to catch the ball.
- Here.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.792
In case a ball comes up
in the stands, use mine.

08:32.542 --> 08:34.375
<i>-
- Oh, this is it.</i>

08:34.667 --> 08:36.792
When Balboni catches this
one, we're gonna be the champs!

08:36.875 --> 08:38.667
- You got it.
- You got it.

08:39.041 --> 08:40.208
You got it!

08:41.125 --> 08:43.667
I got it. I'm the champion of the world!

08:49.166 --> 08:52.291
You moron!
You turned that out into a home run!

08:52.375 --> 08:54.959
Izzy, you just cost us the championship!

08:55.500 --> 08:58.333
Don't worry, no one knows it
was me who caught the ball.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.083
Oh look, I'm on TV!

09:06.166 --> 09:07.458

09:28.125 --> 09:33.333
Oh well, you're pretty darn lucky

09:34.500 --> 09:37.834
Right after you booked us,
we got a call for another gig.

09:37.917 --> 09:39.125
Oh really? What was it?

09:39.208 --> 09:40.125
- Petting zoo.
- Funeral.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.083
Super bowl.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.959
I'll see you after the show, Jaws.

10:37.709 --> 10:40.000
Well, I'm really, really sorry, sir.

10:40.709 --> 10:42.083
Oh, you're going to be sorry.

10:42.166 --> 10:46.250
In fact this whole town's gonna be
sorry when I come back with my gang.

10:51.166 --> 10:52.959
Wow, people seem really scared.

10:53.041 --> 10:55.041
Even that big guy
in the hat's running away.

10:55.458 --> 10:58.250
- Maybe somebody should call the sheriff.
- That guy is the sheriff.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.959
Look, I'm really sorry, everybody.
It was an accident.

11:03.291 --> 11:04.625
It's not your fault, Jerry.

11:04.709 --> 11:06.250
That guy's the leader of the Diablos.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.917
They're a biker gang that have ruined
every Cactus Festival we've ever had.

11:12.083 --> 11:14.709
But this year is gonna be different.

11:15.667 --> 11:16.834
Because...

11:16.917 --> 11:20.583
this year we have The Tiger Trio!

11:20.667 --> 11:22.834
Oh!
-

11:24.208 --> 11:26.792
How lucky, wow.

11:27.166 --> 11:28.875
Good for you...

11:31.208 --> 11:32.250
What?

11:38.959 --> 11:41.500
Well, all in all, our first show
was a success.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.375
Joan, the whole town's in danger
because of us.

11:43.458 --> 11:44.667
Oh well, that's show business.

11:44.750 --> 11:46.083
One night you get a standing ovation,

11:46.166 --> 11:48.250
the next night you get a biker gang
to destroy a whole town.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.500
Off we go.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.625
- Where are you guys going?
-

11:53.875 --> 11:55.125
You're not leaving, are you?

11:55.792 --> 11:57.083
No...

11:57.625 --> 11:59.291
Why would you think that?

11:59.583 --> 12:02.208
Because your bags are packed, you got
a map highlighted back to the freeway,

12:02.291 --> 12:05.500
and two minutes ago Joan yelled,
"Peace out, girl scout!" to my dad.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.166
She may be on to us.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.875
You can't leave now.

12:11.959 --> 12:13.333
You're The Tiger Trio.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.208
This is the first time our
town actually has a chance

12:16.291 --> 12:17.917
to defend ourselves against the Diablos.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.291
Look, Nikki.

12:22.000 --> 12:22.959
The truth is...

12:24.250 --> 12:25.667
we're not good at Karate.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.917
We're good at putting on a show.

12:28.709 --> 12:30.000
See these boards?

12:32.041 --> 12:33.834
- They're not real.
-

12:34.625 --> 12:35.750
So...

12:35.834 --> 12:37.125
you're fakes?

12:37.875 --> 12:40.625
The only thing that was real today
was the way that you made me feel.

12:42.709 --> 12:43.750
Too soon?

12:46.291 --> 12:49.291
I should have known The Tiger Trio
was too good to be true.

12:50.542 --> 12:51.500
Go ahead.

12:52.667 --> 12:53.792
Run away.

12:54.417 --> 12:55.750
Wait, Nikki, wait!

12:57.542 --> 12:59.041
Look, there's something you need to know.

13:00.667 --> 13:02.208
We never got paid.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.834
<i>♪ Here we go, let's start the party ♪</i>

13:07.917 --> 13:09.959
<i>♪ Chop it up like it's karate ♪</i>

13:10.041 --> 13:11.750
All right, there is a crowd of people

13:11.834 --> 13:13.291
waiting in the parking lot to get Izzy

13:13.375 --> 13:15.125
so, we just got to slip him out the back.

13:15.208 --> 13:18.291
- The trick is just blending in.
Right, let's blend.

13:19.041 --> 13:21.000
There you are. Where is he?

13:21.083 --> 13:22.875
We don't know.
We've been looking for him too.

13:22.959 --> 13:25.125
Holy smokes, Salty the sea dog!

13:25.208 --> 13:27.834
I love you. Can I get your autograph?

13:28.083 --> 13:31.125
Sure, except I can't see anything

13:31.208 --> 13:33.875
through my giant fake head!

13:35.250 --> 13:37.000
That's better.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.667
Who do I make it out to?

13:38.750 --> 13:40.625
Lou. L, O, you...

13:40.709 --> 13:43.458
ball-stealing crumpet-muncher!

13:43.542 --> 13:45.291
-
- Get him!

13:52.959 --> 13:54.709
All right, boys.
Let's put these bags in the car

13:54.792 --> 13:56.625
- and put this whole thing behind us.
- Awesome.

13:56.709 --> 13:58.000
- Hello!
-

13:59.875 --> 14:01.083
Don't talk to him.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.583
He may be a Diablo.

14:04.125 --> 14:05.250
My name is Billy.

14:05.291 --> 14:08.834
Everyone in town is saying you're
running away, but I know The Tiger Trio

14:08.917 --> 14:10.667
doesn't run away from anything.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.083
You guys are my heroes.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.250
We'd sure appreciate it
if you'd stop staring at us

14:17.333 --> 14:21.166
with those Doe-eyes filled
with wonder and innocence.

14:23.542 --> 14:25.250
Yeah, you're...

14:25.875 --> 14:27.750
Making me feel all weird inside.

14:29.083 --> 14:30.875
It's called guilt, Joan.

14:31.709 --> 14:33.000
I'm feeling it too.

14:33.959 --> 14:37.542
It's sitting right on top of the little
gas I got from those cactus crab-cakes.

14:40.041 --> 14:41.542
Oh, now it's just the guilt.

14:43.625 --> 14:44.792
I don't know about you two...

14:45.709 --> 14:47.000
but I'm staying here.

14:50.917 --> 14:53.917
Diablos may take me down,
but not without a fight.

14:54.417 --> 14:57.083
Billy, round up everybody and tell them
to meet us in the town square.

14:57.166 --> 14:58.542
- I have a plan.
- Got it!

14:58.625 --> 15:00.041
- Okay, go!
-

15:00.125 --> 15:02.208
Good plan, you got rid of the kid!

15:02.291 --> 15:04.000
- Shotgun!
- Let's go.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.166
No, I have a plan
to take down the Diablos.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.333
And once we announce
that we're not leaving,

15:08.417 --> 15:10.458
the town will cheer us
for the real heroes we are.

15:12.917 --> 15:16.625
Please, citizens of Yucca Valley,
let us not dwell on who the phonies are.

15:16.709 --> 15:17.625
It's you!

15:17.709 --> 15:19.959
Again, this is the thing
that we shall not dwell upon.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.125
Look, people, you've been terrorized
by the Diablos long enough.

15:23.542 --> 15:25.166
Okay? It's time for
this town to fight back.

15:25.250 --> 15:28.125
We can't fight back.
We're just ordinary people.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.375
Ordinary people?

15:31.834 --> 15:34.125
Do you know what I see
when I look out there?

15:36.375 --> 15:38.250
Holy Hannah, you people are ordinary.

15:40.834 --> 15:42.792
We're ordinary people too,

15:42.959 --> 15:45.208
but we made you believe
that we were more than that.

15:45.625 --> 15:48.166
And that's exactly what you're
going to do to the Diablos.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.792
I'm gonna need wire. All the wire in town.

15:50.875 --> 15:52.959
You heard him, people. We need wire!

15:53.041 --> 15:55.375
Yeah, and big pieces
of styrofoam and paint.

15:55.458 --> 15:57.583
Paint, people! Red, blue,
whatever you got!

15:57.667 --> 16:00.375
- And Nikki's phone number.
- Still too soon, Milton!

16:01.875 --> 16:05.041
Now let's make this a town
the Diablos will never mess with again.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.875
- Yeah!
-

16:13.959 --> 16:15.458
Okay, all right!

16:16.125 --> 16:18.917
We lost them,
thanks to my super secret shortcut.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.083
- What took you so long?
-

16:21.959 --> 16:24.000
We've been here for over an hour.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.709
- Now hand him over.
- Whoa, whoa!

16:26.917 --> 16:27.875
Look...

16:27.959 --> 16:29.250
You don't think that I'm mad?

16:30.041 --> 16:31.834
Balboni is my favorite player.

16:31.917 --> 16:33.959
I have posters of him in my room.

16:34.041 --> 16:38.333
I have a reoccurring dream where we play
catch and he lets me call him "Daddy".

16:40.959 --> 16:43.583
Look, Izzy's sorry.
He's never been to a game before.

16:43.709 --> 16:45.166
And he never will again!

16:45.542 --> 16:47.792
He's right. That game was a bore.

16:47.875 --> 16:49.667
It didn't get interesting
until I caught this ball.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.417
- You son--
- No, no, no, hang on!

16:52.291 --> 16:53.875
Izzy did nothing wrong.

16:53.959 --> 16:57.291
His only crime was wanting to experience
the greatest game our country knows.

16:58.667 --> 16:59.750
The thrill of the crowd.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.834
The crack of the bat hitting the ball.

17:04.917 --> 17:06.125
Crack!

17:07.041 --> 17:08.834
A bag of freshly roasted peanuts.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.166
Elephants love peanuts.

17:18.583 --> 17:21.125
Look, all we wanted to do
was share our love of the game with him.

17:21.667 --> 17:23.041
And if that's wrong...

17:23.875 --> 17:25.166
- Then we're wrong.
Yeah.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.875
Jack's right. Don't blame Izzy.

17:28.625 --> 17:29.542
Blame us.

17:31.959 --> 17:33.000
You heard him, Louis.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.542
It's their fault. Let's get 'em.

17:35.625 --> 17:37.959
-
No, no, no!

17:38.250 --> 17:40.083
But we made a heartfelt speech!

17:51.417 --> 17:54.000
Ha! It looks like the town's deserted.

17:54.667 --> 17:58.500
The Tiger Trio didn't even
have the guts to show up.

17:59.458 --> 18:00.542
Well, fellas,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.583
let's bust up their
town so they know we were here.

18:05.875 --> 18:06.750
Ha!

18:12.041 --> 18:14.709
Coming back to this town
was a big mistake.

18:18.500 --> 18:19.458
Look at this, guys.

18:19.542 --> 18:22.458
This twerp thinks he's gonna
take on the Diablos...

18:22.875 --> 18:23.959
all by himself.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.083
I'm not a twerp!

18:26.166 --> 18:27.959
- Hiyah!
-

18:28.709 --> 18:30.000
And I'm not alone.

18:35.125 --> 18:37.792
- He's got friends.
-

18:40.875 --> 18:42.250
Lots of friends.

18:48.166 --> 18:50.166
And we're not backing down anymore.

18:58.542 --> 19:00.375
Hey, stop looking at me, little boy.

19:01.250 --> 19:02.750
I'm not afraid of you.

19:03.166 --> 19:04.583
You should be.

19:04.667 --> 19:05.875
Show him, Billy.

19:09.208 --> 19:11.125
Now get out of my town.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.208
All you people are crazy!

19:13.709 --> 19:15.959
Come on, guys. Let's go, go, go!

19:18.917 --> 19:20.792
Good job, everybody. We did it!

19:23.583 --> 19:26.834
- Tiger Trio! Tiger Trio!
-

19:29.083 --> 19:32.959
From this day forward no one in this
town will ever forget the names

19:33.291 --> 19:36.375
Jaws, Paws and...

19:38.083 --> 19:38.959
Um...

19:40.000 --> 19:41.583
- Claws!
- That's the one.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.000
Thank you.

19:48.041 --> 19:50.250
Milton, I thought Billy
used the last fake brick.

19:51.208 --> 19:52.250
He did.

19:52.333 --> 19:53.959
This girl can kiss.

19:58.125 --> 20:01.083
All right, people,
let's get our cactus on.

20:01.166 --> 20:03.166
- Whoo!
-

20:15.166 --> 20:16.250
Take two.

20:16.709 --> 20:18.417
And action!

20:22.959 --> 20:24.417
Take one.

20:24.542 --> 20:25.875
Action, Milton.

20:29.709 --> 20:31.542
This is tasty. Do we have any butter?

20:32.625 --> 20:35.000
Take 12.
We're gonna get it this time.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.625
-
- And action.

20:42.917 --> 20:44.542
Take 23.

20:44.625 --> 20:46.125
Try getting more speed.

20:46.542 --> 20:48.041
And action!

20:58.166 --> 20:59.166
That's a wrap!

21:00.166 --> 21:01.959
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

21:27.083 --> 21:28.000
<i>Poor soul.</i>

21:32.000 --> 21:32.875
<i>Yes!</i>
