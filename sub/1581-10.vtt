00:05.373 --> 00:08.409
Ezra.
Ezra, you in there?

00:08.411 --> 00:10.144
[ yawns ]
nope.

00:10.146 --> 00:11.779
No ezras in here.

00:34.169 --> 00:35.770
[ panting ]
hey, kanan.

00:35.772 --> 00:38.172
Sorry I'm late.
I was with sabine.

00:38.807 --> 00:40.608
So, you gonna invite me in?

00:40.610 --> 00:44.178
You didn't knock,
so what makes you think
you need an invite?

00:44.180 --> 00:48.116
- I'm sorry.
- Then you should knock first.

00:48.118 --> 00:50.451
Not for that.
For missing training.

00:50.453 --> 00:53.288
It's all the same thing.
The fact that you don't see it--

00:54.290 --> 00:55.757
[ sighs ]

00:55.759 --> 00:57.892
Ezra, when we were on
that asteroid,

00:57.894 --> 01:00.428
You made a dangerous connection
through the force.

01:01.363 --> 01:05.166
Now I have to know
if you... Are ready.

01:05.168 --> 01:08.169
I <i> am </i> ready.
Wait. Ready for what?

01:08.171 --> 01:10.672
For a test,
a real challenge--

01:10.674 --> 01:13.241
One that could determine
if you're meant
to be a jedi...

01:13.776 --> 01:15.543
Or not.

01:22.685 --> 01:25.854
But you said I was a jedi.
Why else would you
be training me?

01:25.856 --> 01:27.689
I never said
you were a jedi.

01:27.691 --> 01:29.925
I said you had the potential
to become one.

01:29.927 --> 01:32.060
But you lack discipline,
focus.

01:32.062 --> 01:33.962
Come on.
You know how I grew up.

01:33.964 --> 01:36.031
I'm not used to
all these rules.

01:36.033 --> 01:38.833
Kanan, I want to become
the jedi you see in me,

01:38.835 --> 01:41.036
The one I don't always
see in myself.

01:41.038 --> 01:43.205
[ sighs ]
you're lucky
I'm not my master.

01:43.207 --> 01:44.973
She'd never let you
get away with--

01:44.975 --> 01:46.708
All the things
you tried to get away with?

01:46.710 --> 01:48.176
You want a second chance
or not?

01:48.178 --> 01:50.946
I mean, if you
want to give me one--

01:50.948 --> 01:52.414
I'm not giving you
anything.

01:53.749 --> 01:55.150
Now go prep the <i> phantom.</i>

01:55.152 --> 01:57.452
As you say, master.

02:02.024 --> 02:03.458
Ah, I might regret this.

02:03.460 --> 02:03.458
You have to do this,
kanan.

02:03.460 --> 02:08.863
After what happened
on the asteroid,
you have to help him.

02:08.865 --> 02:11.399
- I hope I can.
- I know you can.

02:22.979 --> 02:24.913
So, where are we headed
for this test?

02:24.915 --> 02:26.948
That's what
you're gonna tell me.

02:31.320 --> 02:35.924
When I was your age, there were
around 10,000 jedi knights
defending the galaxy.

02:35.926 --> 02:38.026
Now, we are few.

02:38.028 --> 02:41.029
But in those days,
we had small outposts,

02:41.031 --> 02:43.031
Temples spread
throughout the stars.

02:43.033 --> 02:47.469
The empire sought out
these temples and destroyed
many of them, but not all.

02:47.471 --> 02:51.506
I want you to meditate,
let the force guide you
to one of them.

02:51.508 --> 02:54.309
What if
I can't find it?
That's part of the test.

02:54.311 --> 02:57.145
Trust yourself.
Trust the force.

03:00.449 --> 03:02.851
[ chittering ]

03:10.459 --> 03:11.860
[ exhales ]

03:13.195 --> 03:15.530
So, did you
take this test at my age?

03:15.532 --> 03:17.799
It was different
for me, ezra.

03:17.801 --> 03:20.168
Everything was different
back then.

03:20.170 --> 03:22.003
All that remains now
is the force.

03:22.005 --> 03:24.939
And only my connection
to the force can
lead me to the temple.

03:24.941 --> 03:27.375
[ chuckles ]
he can be taught.

03:35.051 --> 03:39.387
There's a massive stone--
with a tunnel, I think--

03:39.389 --> 03:41.556
And a bright star
inside of it.

03:43.959 --> 03:46.594
- And it's right here,
on lothal.
- You sure?

03:46.596 --> 03:49.197
I can't give you
the coordinates,
but I can direct us there.

03:49.199 --> 03:51.099
I know I can.

04:02.378 --> 04:04.212
The stone
from my vision.

04:04.214 --> 04:07.015
Autopilot disengaged.
You already knew.

04:13.556 --> 04:15.590
I checked the holocron
back in my cabin.

04:15.592 --> 04:18.026
And it told you there was
a jedi temple on lothal?

04:18.028 --> 04:19.928
The holocron holds
extensive star maps,

04:19.930 --> 04:22.997
But I was as surprised as you
that there was a temple here.

04:29.939 --> 04:34.075
Course, I couldn't be sure
this is where you were meant
to be, but it makes sense.

04:34.077 --> 04:35.643
This is your home.

04:39.615 --> 04:43.418
You better figure out
how we get inside.
And don't take too long.

04:43.420 --> 04:46.654
Remember,
the empire has access to
all the old jedi records.

04:46.656 --> 04:49.324
They may know about this temple
and have it under surveillance.

05:16.018 --> 05:20.021
Nothing.
No sign of an entrance.
Not even a crack.

05:20.023 --> 05:22.624
But I know
this is the place.
I feel it.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.426
Seriously, can't you
give me a hint?

05:24.428 --> 05:26.428
Don't look. Listen.

05:26.430 --> 05:30.031
Use the force to hear the stone
and its story.

05:36.105 --> 05:39.974
The stone.
The temple. It--

05:39.976 --> 05:41.976
It wants to admit me.

05:41.978 --> 05:44.312
No. Wait, not me.

05:44.314 --> 05:47.615
Us. Master and padawan.

05:47.617 --> 05:49.350
Together.

05:49.352 --> 05:51.453
Then together
it shall be.

06:02.131 --> 06:04.032
[ rumbling ]

06:21.217 --> 06:24.052
Whoa.
Don't lose focus.

06:24.054 --> 06:26.154
We don't want this thing
crashing down on us.

06:53.048 --> 06:55.016

06:58.821 --> 07:00.421
[ gasps ]

07:03.559 --> 07:06.661
[ loud rumble ]
you lost focus.

07:06.663 --> 07:08.696
Well, dead guys
are distracting.

07:08.698 --> 07:11.733
In here, you'll have to
face your worst fears
and overcome them.

07:11.735 --> 07:14.035
And there's
no guarantee of success.

07:14.037 --> 07:17.405
I have plenty of faith.
Faith you'll keep me on track.

07:17.407 --> 07:19.140
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

07:19.142 --> 07:20.708
Where are you gonna be?

07:20.710 --> 07:22.544
Right here, with them--

07:22.546 --> 07:24.812
Masters whose padawans
never returned.

07:24.814 --> 07:27.315
You're putting your life
in my hands?

07:27.317 --> 07:31.286
- You put your training in mine.
- [ rumbling, echoing ]

07:33.756 --> 07:35.323
[ sighs ]
good luck.

07:37.826 --> 07:39.827
Wait. What exactly
am I looking for?

07:39.829 --> 07:42.096
Nothing and everything.

07:42.098 --> 07:44.365
- That doesn't help.
- I know.

07:45.834 --> 07:47.802
But that's what my master
told me.

08:01.617 --> 08:03.384
[ scoffs ]
great.

08:03.386 --> 08:05.153
Should've brought the holocron.

08:05.155 --> 08:07.155
Loth-rat, loth-cat,
loth-wolf, run.

08:07.157 --> 08:09.190
Pick a path
and all is done.

08:09.192 --> 08:10.792
Really?
That's how you're choosing?

08:10.794 --> 08:12.360
What happened to
using the force?

08:12.362 --> 08:13.728
What happened to
having faith in me?

08:13.730 --> 08:15.763
Second thoughts, fortunately.

08:15.765 --> 08:17.365
Come on.

08:20.135 --> 08:21.703
Kanan! Slow down.

08:21.705 --> 08:24.806
I told you.
We might not have much time.
The empire could--

08:24.808 --> 08:26.574
[ lightsaber ignites ]
[ screams ]

08:26.576 --> 08:28.776

[ thuds ]

08:36.818 --> 08:39.120
The inquisitor.

08:39.121 --> 08:41.289
I felt a disturbance
in the force...

08:41.291 --> 08:43.890
The moment the jedi decided
to bring you here, padawan.

08:44.793 --> 08:48.830
- No.
- Now, who dies first?

08:50.866 --> 08:52.834
No!

08:52.836 --> 08:54.769
I'll die before I let you
harm the boy.

08:54.771 --> 08:56.537
How reasonable.

10:04.973 --> 10:06.474

10:06.476 --> 10:09.377
So he called himself "kanan,"
did he?

10:09.379 --> 10:12.280
Well, it hardly matters now.
Your turn.

10:13.916 --> 10:17.452
I'll make you pay.
I swear you'll pay!

10:23.525 --> 10:28.496
[ groans ]
apparently someone's not quite
ready to become a jedi...

10:28.964 --> 10:30.998

I gotta agree with chop.
I don't think ezra was ready.

I don't think
we'll be seeing him again,
which is too bad.

11:12.909 --> 11:16.778
Really? 'cause I'll be happy
just to get my cabin back
to myself.

11:16.780 --> 11:20.348
It's too bad
because he had skills
that were useful to our cause.

11:20.350 --> 11:24.585
[ zeb ]
hah. Knew there was a reason
you were being so nice to him.

11:24.587 --> 11:25.953
That's pretty cold,
guys.

11:25.955 --> 11:30.291
After all,
he's just a little kid--
scared, alone.

11:30.293 --> 11:31.926
Me? I pity him.

11:34.530 --> 11:37.398
Well, look who's here.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.066
How long do you think
he was listening?

11:39.068 --> 11:40.902
Long enough.

11:40.904 --> 11:42.770
Eh--
nothing personal, kid.

No. This isn't you talking.
I'm not back on the <i> ghost.</i>

aren't you?

That's right.

12:42.831 --> 12:45.800
Kanan?
Kanan, where are you?

12:45.802 --> 12:48.936
No. He died!
The inquisitor killed him!

12:48.938 --> 12:52.073
Or-- or-or was that
an illusion too?

12:52.075 --> 12:53.941
Either way, I'm trapped.

No way I get this open

I can survive this.

Maybe kanan's not dead.
Maybe he's just injured.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

You were on the <i> ghost,</i>
and that-- all that--

13:28.411 --> 13:29.911
That was
definitely an illusion.

It may have been,
but I assure you,

13:32.916 --> 13:35.082
I am not.

13:37.819 --> 13:39.820
No way out, padawan.

There's always a way out--

No. Afraid of being
alone again? Sure.

13:52.068 --> 13:54.902
Afraid of letting down

16:12.707 --> 16:15.576
Because of me,
because of who I am.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.621
Which way
is the right way?

16:27.623 --> 16:30.124
<i>The wrong question,</i>
<i>that is.</i>

16:30.126 --> 16:32.760
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

16:32.762 --> 16:34.762
To be honest,
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

16:34.764 --> 16:37.765
<i>[ chuckles ]</i>
<i>a better question, that is.</i>

16:37.767 --> 16:42.002
Kanan said I was gonna
be tested, but he never
said what for or why.

16:42.004 --> 16:44.338
<i>And your master--</i>
<i>tell you everything, must he?</i>

16:44.340 --> 16:46.907
Well-- no.

16:46.909 --> 16:50.711
<i>Your path you must decide.</i>

17:00.789 --> 17:04.825
<i>A dangerous time this is</i>
<i>for your apprentice, for you.</i>

17:04.827 --> 17:07.928
I know. I can sense it.

17:07.930 --> 17:11.397
I feel as if his abilities
are growing faster
than I can teach him.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.867
<i>You sense, or you fear?</i>

17:13.869 --> 17:16.871
[ sighs ]
I lost my way
for a long time,

17:16.873 --> 17:20.007
But now I have a chance
to change things.

17:20.009 --> 17:23.877
<i>Hmm. Last chance.</i>

17:23.880 --> 17:27.414
I won't let him lose his way,
not like I did.

17:34.389 --> 17:35.656
Whoa.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.662
<i>Tell me.</i>
<i>Why must you become jedi?</i>

17:41.664 --> 17:44.265
I don't know.
I guess because kanan
believes I can.

17:44.267 --> 17:47.835
<i>Ah. Kanan thinks you can.</i>

17:47.837 --> 17:49.803
<i>Hmm. And you?</i>

17:49.805 --> 17:52.339
Well, I'll become stronger,
powerful.

17:52.341 --> 17:54.909
<i>Ah. Power you seek.</i>

17:54.911 --> 17:57.745
I'd make the empire suffer
for everything it did,

17:57.747 --> 18:00.447
For everything it took,
for my parents.

18:00.449 --> 18:03.150
I-- I wouldn't
be helpless anymore!

18:03.152 --> 18:06.253
<i>Ah. Jedi way is revenge?</i>

18:06.255 --> 18:08.122
<i>Teach you this,</i>
<i>your master did?</i>

18:08.124 --> 18:10.391
No. Kanan would never.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.860
He's a good master,
a-a great master.

18:12.862 --> 18:15.429
<i>Then why seek you revenge?</i>
I don't.

18:15.431 --> 18:21.135
<i>Hmm. Inside you</i>
<i>much anger, much fear.</i>

18:21.137 --> 18:24.004
I just want
to protect myself
and my friends.

18:24.006 --> 18:26.106
<i>And this is why</i>
<i>you must be jedi?</i>

18:26.108 --> 18:28.075
Yes, and not just them.

18:28.077 --> 18:30.911
Everyone.
I'll protect everyone.

18:30.913 --> 18:34.014
Before I met kanan,
I only ever thought
of myself,

18:34.016 --> 18:36.951
But kanan and the rest,
they don't think like that.

18:36.953 --> 18:40.454
They help people,
they give everything away,
and I see it.

18:40.456 --> 18:42.323
I see how
it makes people feel.

18:42.325 --> 18:45.492
<i>Feel, yes. How?</i>

18:46.428 --> 18:48.362
Alive.

18:48.364 --> 18:51.098
They feel alive,
like I do now.

18:51.100 --> 18:54.101
<i>Good. Good.</i>

18:54.103 --> 18:58.005
<i>Ahead of you a difficult path</i>
<i>there is, padawan.</i>

18:58.007 --> 19:01.542
<i>A jedi you may yet be.</i>

[ rumbling ]

19:33.375 --> 19:37.311
- How are you?
- Different,
but the same.

19:37.313 --> 19:39.346
[ chuckles ]
I know what you mean.

19:39.348 --> 19:41.448
I found this.

19:41.450 --> 19:43.117
I don't believe it.

19:43.119 --> 19:45.019
What is it?
It's good, right?

19:45.021 --> 19:47.921
Ezra, that's
a kyber crystal.

19:47.923 --> 19:50.124
Oh. Wow.

19:50.126 --> 19:51.892
What's a kyber crystal?

19:51.894 --> 19:53.927
It's a lightsaber crystal.

19:55.463 --> 19:58.565
I have to admit,
when I brought you here,
I didn't see this happening.

19:58.567 --> 20:00.934
Getting a lightsaber crystal
is a big step.

20:00.936 --> 20:03.037
[ rumbling ]

20:06.007 --> 20:08.475
It's strange that
it's just... Here.

20:08.477 --> 20:10.377
And it will be,
for now,

20:10.379 --> 20:13.447
And hopefully it'll be here
long after you and I are gone.

20:13.449 --> 20:16.884
I was just thinking--
shouldn't we use it
as a base or something?

20:16.886 --> 20:18.419
Who knows
what else is in there?

20:18.421 --> 20:20.020
I know what's in there.

20:20.022 --> 20:21.922
The past.

20:40.909 --> 20:43.243
He's been working
on that thing for weeks.

20:43.245 --> 20:45.379
What kind of lightsaber
could he possibly build...

20:45.381 --> 20:47.381
With the junk
we have laying around?

20:47.383 --> 20:50.017
Well, I had a few
spare parts I found
over the years.

20:50.019 --> 20:51.985
And I had some
bits and pieces
that might work--

20:51.987 --> 20:54.288
Modulation circuits,
an energy gate.

20:54.290 --> 20:57.057
Chopper even donated
a power cell.
[ droid language ]

20:57.059 --> 20:59.059
I gave him
some additional tech.

20:59.061 --> 21:01.362
He was pretty specific
about what he was looking for.

21:05.900 --> 21:06.967
[ exhales ]

21:07.902 --> 21:07.901
[ gasps ]

21:07.903 --> 21:10.938
I thought I'd let you
check it out first.

21:15.443 --> 21:18.011
Well, it's... Different.

21:18.013 --> 21:20.481
But that seems
about right for you.

21:20.483 --> 21:22.049
Go for it.
