00:01.401 --> 00:03.403
Tonight, on "Shark Tank"...

00:03.504 --> 00:04.872
I'm here to take the word
"drinking" back from alcohol.

00:04.972 --> 00:06.507
Ooh!
Yeah, it's nice!

00:06.607 --> 00:07.808
<i>C'est bon.
C'est très bon.</i>

00:07.908 --> 00:09.276
This has, of course,
been our dream,

00:09.376 --> 00:10.844
our entire lives
to stand on this stage.

00:10.944 --> 00:13.847
You're asking me to make
a bet on the business.

00:13.947 --> 00:17.017
Every single person
who's ever bet on me has won.

00:17.117 --> 00:19.920
I feel a little insulted
that you just let me sit there.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.822
- Whoa!
- Grasshopper will learn.

00:21.922 --> 00:23.524
The problem is,
this is hard to sell.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.192
But make no mistake--

00:25.292 --> 00:27.761
I...am a lion.
Rawr!

00:35.736 --> 00:36.870
First in the Tank

00:36.970 --> 00:40.374
is a product created
for students, by students.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.451
Whoo!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.554
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Matt Gronberg.

00:53.654 --> 00:54.821
And I'm Sam Chason.

00:54.922 --> 00:58.759
We're here today seeking
$250,000 for 5% of our company,

00:58.859 --> 00:59.660
Storage Scholars.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.961
Oh, guys.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.363
So think back to your
first year of college.

01:03.463 --> 01:04.865
It's the last week
of school.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.000
You're saying goodbye to all
the new friends you just met,

01:07.100 --> 01:08.402
and you're up late studying

01:08.502 --> 01:10.370
when you get
the text message from Mom--

01:10.470 --> 01:12.940
"Hey, good luck on your
last exam tomorrow, sweetie.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.341
Are you all set
to move out?"

01:14.441 --> 01:15.976
The panic sets in.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.444
You don't have a car
to buy boxes,

01:17.544 --> 01:19.146
you haven't reserved
that storage unit,

01:19.246 --> 01:21.281
and you don't even remember
how that sectional couch

01:21.381 --> 01:22.950
got <i>into</i>
your dorm room.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.551
Well, that is
where we come in.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.887
You can simply go online
and create an account.

01:26.987 --> 01:29.189
You can add your parent to
overlook your order information,

01:29.289 --> 01:32.326
and you can pay a $50
fully refundable deposit,

01:32.426 --> 01:34.861
and we'll handle your entire
move-out for you.

01:34.962 --> 01:37.731
Students are given boxes,
tape, bubble wrap, and labels

01:37.831 --> 01:39.900
on campus
the week before final exams.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.102
They pack up their belongings,
lock up their room,

01:42.202 --> 01:43.303
and go home.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.105
We have a partnership
with their university

01:45.205 --> 01:47.441
to unlock that room
once the campus is empty,

01:47.541 --> 01:49.743
and we'll move everything
into storage for the summer.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.712
We'll even have all their
belongings ready and waiting

01:51.812 --> 01:52.879
in their new room

01:52.980 --> 01:54.848
when they return to campus
the following semester.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.917
So, Sam,
who does all this moving?

01:57.050 --> 01:58.385
That's the best part.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.387
All the moving is done
by trained fellow students,

02:00.487 --> 02:02.823
creating high-paying jobs
on campus.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.691
So Sharks, as two
18-year-olds

02:04.791 --> 02:06.693
terrified at the thought
of student debt,

02:06.793 --> 02:08.261
we built Storage Scholars
in college,

02:08.362 --> 02:10.831
which allowed each of us
to graduate debt-free.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.532
Who's ready to join us
on our mission

02:12.633 --> 02:14.668
to empower students
across America to do the same?

02:14.768 --> 02:16.003
Wow.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.070
Alright.
Cool.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.939
How many colleges
have you guys signed up?

02:19.039 --> 02:20.607
We're on
23 college campuses.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.075
Where are you
currently?

02:22.175 --> 02:23.810
So, we're at a variety
of colleges

02:23.910 --> 02:26.313
ranging all the way from
New York down to Texas.

02:26.413 --> 02:29.116
It started at our alma mater,
Wake Forest University.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.484
We kind of grew in
the Carolinas,

02:30.584 --> 02:31.918
and then kind of spread
our footprint.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.620
How much is
the total move?

02:33.720 --> 02:36.590
It averages out to $559
for the whole service.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.825
So that's boxes, tape,
and packing supplies

02:38.925 --> 02:40.260
delivered on campus.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.763
That's the pickup,
the storage for the four months,

02:42.863 --> 02:44.965
the delivery,
and $100 of insurance

02:45.065 --> 02:46.166
complimentary on
every item.

02:46.266 --> 02:47.501
I'm assuming you're going to
pay the college

02:47.601 --> 02:48.969
to get into
their service area?

02:49.069 --> 02:51.138
So our strategy
as a business

02:51.238 --> 02:52.806
is we want to partner
with colleges

02:52.906 --> 02:54.408
to get, like,
their full endorsement

02:54.508 --> 02:56.243
and create this total,
like, key access,

02:56.343 --> 02:58.311
pack it, lock it,
leave it experience.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.848
So will they put--
Okay, $559, that's my revenue.
Where are my costs?

03:01.948 --> 03:05.552
So our costs are about $199,
and that includes

03:05.652 --> 03:07.387
all of the boxes, tape,
and package supplies,

03:07.487 --> 03:09.756
the labor, the warehousing--
everything.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.558
We're the only people
that I know of doing

03:11.658 --> 03:13.293
the full key access system
in which

03:13.393 --> 03:14.361
they pack it, lock it,
and leave it.

03:14.461 --> 03:15.662
So there's nobody else
doing key access?

03:15.762 --> 03:17.998
Not with the students
and with the technology.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.900
And we have our own
custom-built technology,

03:20.000 --> 03:21.268
which is what
allows us to have

03:21.368 --> 03:23.136
the 4.8-star ratings
that we do.

03:23.236 --> 03:24.471
What's the custom
technology?

03:24.571 --> 03:25.672
It's a Web app.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.140
It was actually built
by his brother,

03:27.240 --> 03:29.910
who's a full stack developer,
over the last six years.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.845
But essentially,
it just does so much

03:31.945 --> 03:34.114
of the automating
for our process

03:34.214 --> 03:37.217
to be able to do 3,300 moves
across 23 campuses

03:37.317 --> 03:39.519
in 9 states at the exact
same week of the year

03:39.619 --> 03:40.721
and nail it every time,
alright? So there's--

03:40.821 --> 03:41.755
Wow.
Impressive.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.757
Tell us about
your background,

03:43.857 --> 03:45.358
and why did you
come up with this?

03:45.459 --> 03:47.594
Yeah. So, I grew up in a
family of two high-school
teachers,

03:47.694 --> 03:49.062
and education was
highly valued.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.465
But when I decided on
Wake Forest University,

03:51.565 --> 03:53.667
$70,000 a year. Wow.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.203
I was looking at over
$100,000 in student loans,

03:56.303 --> 03:58.071
and I always knew that
when I got to college,

03:58.171 --> 03:59.706
starting a business
would be my path

03:59.806 --> 04:01.007
to financial freedom.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.142
So when I got to college,

04:02.242 --> 04:03.910
I noticed there was
a gap in the market.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.879
I also had a bunch of friends
that were looking to make money,

04:05.979 --> 04:07.748
and I kind of combined
the two needs together.

04:07.848 --> 04:11.218
We went door to door, getting
made fun of every single day,

04:11.318 --> 04:14.054
but by the end of that year,
we serviced 64 customers

04:14.154 --> 04:15.489
had $18,000 in revenue,

04:15.589 --> 04:17.190
and that's how
Storage Scholars started.
Good for you.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.025
I just want to hear--
you went in with

04:19.126 --> 04:22.796
this huge $100,000-plus debt
you were going to graduate with,

04:22.896 --> 04:25.632
you started a business
while you were at school...
Yes, sir.

04:25.732 --> 04:26.967
...and paid off
all that debt?

04:27.067 --> 04:28.368
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.
- Wow.

04:28.468 --> 04:30.604
And I came in a year later,
I had a very similar story.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.339
I was trying to pay
for both my undergrad,

04:32.439 --> 04:33.774
and then I eventually
had big dreams

04:33.874 --> 04:35.008
of going to
medical school.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.710
So he said,
"Why don't you come work

04:36.810 --> 04:38.712
for this business opportunity
that I have?"

04:38.812 --> 04:40.347
So I ended up
working a lot.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.749
I worked 106 hours
in 7 days,

04:42.849 --> 04:44.718
unloading trucks
until 4:00 in the morning,

04:44.818 --> 04:46.987
just dying to prove my worth
to this business,

04:47.087 --> 04:48.822
and I was at the right place
at the right time.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.124
And are guys partners now?
Are you 50/50?

04:51.224 --> 04:52.993
70/30 breakdown
right now. Yeah.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.729
Okay, and did you ever take in
any money from anybody else?

04:55.829 --> 04:56.930
No.
No. Zero dollars
to date.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.031
And how old
are you guys now?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.733
I'm 24. He's 23. Yeah.

04:59.833 --> 05:00.867
And this is what you
do full time?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.169
100% full time. Absolutely.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.436
Good for you guys.
Good for y'all.
Thank you.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.138
So, what are your sales
to date?

05:05.238 --> 05:08.675
So, this year, we've done
$1.826 million in sales.

05:08.775 --> 05:09.843
Oh, my God.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.078
- Wow. Goodness. Wow.
- Congratulations!

05:12.179 --> 05:13.380
So at your biggest school,

05:13.480 --> 05:15.348
what's the most number
of storages that you have

05:15.448 --> 05:16.550
at your
biggest school?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.318
Yeah, so, we're doing
about 700 students'

05:18.418 --> 05:20.220
summer storage
at Wake Forest University.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.922
At Wake Forest--
that's your home school, right?

05:22.022 --> 05:23.023
Yeah. Yeah.
So everybody knows you.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.858
What about a new school
that you added outside

05:24.958 --> 05:26.226
the Carolinas,
like in Texas?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.962
Yeah, I mean, SMU,
we did 269 customers.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.397
So how do you grow that?

05:30.497 --> 05:32.699
So a lot of it is through the
partnership with the university,

05:32.799 --> 05:34.367
and they're gonna help
e-mail on our behalf,

05:34.467 --> 05:36.970
get on the university website,
which drives SEO.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.005
So there's
a whole variety--
So it goes back to--
you got to get the

05:39.105 --> 05:41.208
Yeah.
Listen, I'll make you
an offer, okay?

05:41.308 --> 05:42.342
Oh, God.
I've heard enough.

05:42.442 --> 05:43.977
You got an offer coming.
You got an offer coming.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.312
I'm gonna make an offer. Alright.

05:45.412 --> 05:46.913
I think, look,
at the end of the day,

05:47.013 --> 05:48.548
either it's a good business
or it isn't.

05:48.648 --> 05:49.749
No way for 5%.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.719
I'll give you--
I'll do the $250,000 for 20%.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.322
Thank you so much
for the offer.

05:55.422 --> 05:56.456
- Appreciate it.
- We really do.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.124
Hey, it's an offer.
What do you got, Robert?

05:58.225 --> 06:00.660
Alright, well, listen, I just
want to tell you what I think.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.363
First of all, great idea.

06:03.463 --> 06:06.466
I mean, necessity,
the mother of invention,
right? Thank you.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.870
But I think you need to give
your valuation an evaluation.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.505
A little massage.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.108
And it's just-- it's
so out there for me, you guys.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.610
I absolutely love you.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.044
But I am out.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.112
Thank you, Lori.
Appreciate it.
Thank you, Lori.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.380
I like this.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.718
I'll offer you
the $250,000 for--

06:24.818 --> 06:27.454
I'll match Kevin--
$250,000 for 20%.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.856
Thank you so much, Daymond.
Really appreciate that.

06:29.956 --> 06:34.861
So, guys, I mean,
super impressive,

06:34.961 --> 06:35.962
great business sense.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.632
You have a great maturity
about you.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.735
In some businesses,
moving slowly's good.

06:41.835 --> 06:45.005
What I've learned from you,
you got to go faster.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.574
Yeah.
And so to go faster,
this is where money helps.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.676
- So you've got two offers.
- Sure.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.445
Kevin offered $250,000
for 20%.

06:52.545 --> 06:55.548
Daymond offered
$250,000 for 20%.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.718
I like the 20%, but I'll
actually give you more money.

06:58.818 --> 07:02.222
I think your valuation
is inflated.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.090
But it's a bit
of a bet on you.

07:04.190 --> 07:07.627
I'll give you $500,000
for 20%.

07:07.727 --> 07:08.962
Whoa!

07:17.337 --> 07:18.538
One Shark is out.

07:18.638 --> 07:21.942
Kevin and Daymond
have each offered $250,000

07:22.042 --> 07:25.045
for 20% of Matt and Sam's
college moving service,

07:25.145 --> 07:26.279
Storage Scholars.

07:26.379 --> 07:29.249
But Robert has offered
to double the money.

07:29.349 --> 07:32.152
I'll give you $500,000
for 20%.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.386
Whoa!

07:33.486 --> 07:34.487
Thank you so much, Robert. Robert.

07:34.587 --> 07:36.389
That's incredible.
You go faster.

07:36.489 --> 07:37.891
Guys, I'll sweeten the deal.

07:37.991 --> 07:41.428
Robert has $500,000
for 20%.

07:41.528 --> 07:45.665
Kevin and I will give you
$250,000 apiece for 40%.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.435
Thank you, guys.
Appreciate it.

07:48.535 --> 07:51.004
Matt, I offered you
twice what you were asking. Yeah.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.974
Far better than
the other two Sharks.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.108
What do you want to do?

07:55.208 --> 07:56.643
I mean, I think
at this point, like,

07:56.743 --> 07:58.645
this has, of course,
been our dream our entire lives,

07:58.745 --> 07:59.879
to stand on this stage.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.781
And I wouldn't want to not
hear from every Shark.

08:01.881 --> 08:04.284
I think that's
an absolutely incredible offer.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.652
I'm just wondering--
we've heard from everyone,

08:05.752 --> 08:06.720
but if there's
potentially another offer.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.054
Mark,
what are you gonna do?

08:08.154 --> 08:10.256
Oh, there is another Shark.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.192
So I'll make you guys
an offer.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.460
And congrats for getting
all these offers.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.361
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

08:14.461 --> 08:15.762
- I'll make you the 250K.
- Yeah.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.664
But I want 12%.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.299
Okay.
And the reason I'm asking

08:19.399 --> 08:21.201
for a little higher valuation
than Robert--

08:21.301 --> 08:22.602
you still get to keep
most of your equity,

08:22.702 --> 08:25.171
so, you know,
you're diluted minimally.
Sure, sure.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.840
But, I mean,
I've got a platform,

08:26.940 --> 08:29.976
and, you know, there are
schools that I have
connections to. Yeah.

08:30.076 --> 08:32.112
And if I get out there
starting to talk about it,

08:32.212 --> 08:33.813
maybe they won't all
be partner schools... Sure.

08:33.913 --> 08:36.483
...but the phone's gonna ring
for you to open up new schools.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.584
- Absolutely.
- Right?

08:37.684 --> 08:39.753
And so that's the value
that I can bring.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.955
Yeah, and I know-- Thank you
so much for that offer.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.957
I know college debt
is a big thing to you.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.492
Yeah, for sure.
You've been very outspoken
about it.

08:45.592 --> 08:46.993
Yeah, for sure.
I think that's
really amazing.

08:47.093 --> 08:48.461
- Alright.
- So, guys, you have four offers.

08:48.561 --> 08:50.563
What do you want to do?

08:54.401 --> 08:56.469
Yeah. So, first of all, guys,
this is incredible.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.104
This is a dream come true
to get all these offers,

08:58.204 --> 09:00.006
be here with you all.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.274
We do have one counter.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.475
We're interested in
all the Sharks right now,

09:02.575 --> 09:03.543
but we have one counter
right here.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.945
Would you be willing
to do $350,000 for 8%?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.313
No.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.682
I'll do 10%.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.885
But you guys are gonna
have to give up something

09:11.985 --> 09:13.720
'cause I'm gonna give
you something you
can't get elsewhere.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.722
Sure. Would you come up
to $300,000 for 10%?

09:15.822 --> 09:17.090
No.
Do a $3 million valuation?

09:17.190 --> 09:18.024
$250,000 for 10%.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.292
Don't worry about
the valuation,

09:19.392 --> 09:20.794
'cause it's still
the same dilution,

09:20.894 --> 09:22.996
and that $50,000
is not gonna change your life.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.831
You're gonna need more money.
Why would you do that?

09:24.931 --> 09:25.965
Why won't you run faster?

09:27.333 --> 09:28.601
Because it's not
just about the money.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.136
Well, that's true.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.406
Mark, you got a deal.
Mark, you have a deal.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.408
Done.
Appreciate it so much.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.976
Let's go, baby.
Let's go.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.045
...baby.
Yes, sir. Let's go, Matt.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.280
We'll get this done.
Thanks, Mark.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.347
Appreciate it, guys. Thanks.
Appreciate it.

09:41.448 --> 09:42.248
Thank you.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.617
Congrats, guys.

09:44.717 --> 09:45.885
That's crazy.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.291
Oh, my...

09:51.391 --> 09:53.560
Mark gave us the deal
that we were looking for.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.495
And we're just
over the moon.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.397
I'm speechless right now.
I can't even speak.
We came in wanting him.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.199
He's super passionate
about our mission

09:59.299 --> 10:00.767
of eliminating
college debt.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.068
He's gonna give people
the opportunity

10:02.168 --> 10:05.105
to be able to do this,
create jobs on college campuses.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.506
And I know that he's gonna
be the right partner

10:06.606 --> 10:07.607
to put some wind
behind this.

10:07.707 --> 10:08.708
We're really excited.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.009
What was your deal?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.978
250K for 10%.

10:12.078 --> 10:13.813
You cut their value
in half.

10:13.913 --> 10:17.217
Sometimes when we negotiate
a really good deal for us,

10:17.317 --> 10:18.818
the pressure's on us
to deliver now.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.687
Yeah, it is.
Yeah, of course.

10:23.923 --> 10:24.924
In Season 12,

10:25.024 --> 10:27.093
we saw Oliver Zak
and Selom Agbitor

10:27.193 --> 10:28.461
make a deal with Mark Cuban

10:28.561 --> 10:31.431
for their tattoo skincare
company, Mad Rabbit Tattoo.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.800
Why are you here?
We want to be the premier

10:33.900 --> 10:35.034
and the face
of tattoo aftercare.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.736
Let's see
what they're up to now.

10:38.204 --> 10:41.274
The idea for Mad Rabbit really
came to Selom and I in college.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.309
Oliver and I started
with $300 each.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.044
We ordered ingredients
off of Amazon

10:45.145 --> 10:47.380
and skipped class to cook this
in his college apartment.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.815
Since airing
on "Shark Tank,"

10:48.915 --> 10:50.617
we've landed a deal
with Urban Outfitters

10:50.717 --> 10:53.887
that placed us in 150 stores
across the U. S. and Canada,

10:53.987 --> 10:55.755
landed 200 tattoo parlors,

10:55.855 --> 10:58.158
and have sold in over 100
countries worldwide.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.559
When we first
pitched the Sharks,

10:59.659 --> 11:00.960
we only had one product.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.730
The Mad Rabbit skincare system
is now up to eight products.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.000
Before pitching to the Sharks,
we had sales of $3 million.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.735
Since inking a deal
with Mark Cuban,

11:08.835 --> 11:11.838
we've done over
$14 million in sales.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.840
You guys were really humble.
You didn't brag a lot.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.875
But you're kicking a lot
of your competitors' ass.

11:15.975 --> 11:17.877
Mark has been
a fantastic partner

11:17.977 --> 11:20.246
not only by following on
in subsequent rounds,

11:20.346 --> 11:22.749
but also providing
strategic business advice.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.852
Advertising online is becoming
more and more difficult

11:25.952 --> 11:27.654
and getting less and less
of a return.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.956
And a big part of what you've
done that's really stood out

11:30.056 --> 11:31.624
is your own
content creation.

11:31.724 --> 11:33.459
To grow in our space,
we realized that we had to

11:33.560 --> 11:35.595
move away from
traditional paid advertising.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.096
That's what led us
to inking a deal

11:37.197 --> 11:40.533
with the largest tattoo
community online and in print.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.936
Mad Rabbit just signed
a deal with <i>Inked</i> magazine,

11:43.036 --> 11:46.306
which is the number-one source
of content for the tattoo world.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.341
I mean, anybody and everybody
who's got any ink on them

11:48.441 --> 11:49.842
is aware of <i>Inked</i> magazine.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.578
They connect
as part of a community,

11:51.678 --> 11:53.413
and Mad Rabbit is right
in the middle of it.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.683
And I can't think of
a better place for them to be.

11:56.783 --> 11:59.018
As a first-generation
American from Ghana,

11:59.118 --> 12:01.020
I am so grateful
for the experience

12:01.120 --> 12:02.455
that "Shark Tank"
has given me.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.690
I could never
have imagined

12:03.790 --> 12:05.658
running a multimillion-dollar
business.

12:05.758 --> 12:07.493
My advice to
entrepreneurs everywhere

12:07.594 --> 12:10.597
is never stop learning
and never stop asking questions.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.866
Welcome, everyone, to
the biweekly all-hands
meeting.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.034
If two college students

12:15.134 --> 12:16.769
could start
a multimillion-dollar business

12:16.869 --> 12:18.004
with $300 each,

12:18.104 --> 12:20.139
we have faith
that you can do it, too.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.475
All it takes is hard work
and perseverance.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.876
I believe that
if there is a will,

12:23.977 --> 12:25.478
there's a way to succeed.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.592
Next in the Tank
is a stylish alternative

12:39.692 --> 12:41.294
to boozy beverages.

12:51.137 --> 12:53.539
<i>Bonjour,</i> Sharks.
My name is Melanie.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.907
I'm the founder of Ghia.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.576
I was born and raised
in Lyon, France,

12:56.676 --> 12:59.545
and I now live
in Los Angeles, California.

12:59.646 --> 13:03.650
I'm seeking $250,000
for a 5% equity stake

13:03.750 --> 13:05.752
in my company, Ghia. Hmm.

13:05.852 --> 13:08.087
Sharks, how many times
have you wanted

13:08.187 --> 13:09.722
to take a night off of booze

13:09.822 --> 13:12.725
and the only option
at the party was water?

13:12.825 --> 13:15.895
How many times have you wanted
to take a night off of drinking

13:15.995 --> 13:19.432
and been asked
if you're sick or pregnant?

13:19.532 --> 13:22.502
I'm here to take the word
"drinking" back from alcohol.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.104
That's why I created Ghia.

13:25.204 --> 13:27.140
Ghia is delicious.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.043
It's fresh, bitter, complex.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.879
It has notes of yuzu, rosemary,

13:32.979 --> 13:36.316
juicy Riesling grapes,
and a sharp kick of citrus.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.583
And it's nonalcoholic.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.519
There's truly
only good things in it.

13:39.619 --> 13:43.656
A Ghia spritz is a perfect
accompaniment to any celebration

13:43.756 --> 13:45.491
without a hangover
the next morning.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.126
So how do you drink Ghia?

13:47.226 --> 13:49.128
You can mix it
with your favorite bubbles

13:49.228 --> 13:51.197
or have one of our
ready-made spritzes.

13:51.297 --> 13:55.668
Sharks, who is ready to get
over the influence with Ghia?

13:55.768 --> 13:58.404
Wow. How do we drink it?
I want to try it.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.340
Let's have one together. Okay.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.242
So you can have one
of our ready-made spritzes.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.211
This one is mixed
with sparkling water.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.480
This one is mixed
with our homemade ginger beer.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.382
It's my personal favorite.

14:09.482 --> 14:12.652
And lime and salt
is our newest one.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.220
Oh, wow!
That's really nice.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.456
Melanie, how many
calories in this?

14:16.556 --> 14:17.957
About 50.
Mmm!

14:18.057 --> 14:19.892
- In the whole thing?
- In the whole thing.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.427
Melanie,
this is really nice.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.895
I love this one. Ugh.

14:22.995 --> 14:24.931
The idea is that
it's a nonalcoholic amaro,

14:25.031 --> 14:26.432
like an Italian drink,
you know,

14:26.532 --> 14:28.401
akin to a Campari
or an apple spritz.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.970
Oh, that's what it reminds
me of-- like a Campari. Yes.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.338
Exactly.
Yeah.

14:32.438 --> 14:34.540
But an all-natural version,
much lighter.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.242
And you know exactly
what's in it.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.777
Ooh!
Yeah, it's nice.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.445
<i>C'est bon.
C'est très bon.</i>

14:39.545 --> 14:40.947
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>
It's got bitters in it.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.482
<i>Très, trs bon.</i>

14:42.582 --> 14:44.016
What do you sell each one
of these for?

14:44.117 --> 14:45.284
And what does it
cost you to make?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.653
Yes, so we actually
just increased our prices.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.056
And interestingly,
our sales have gone up.

14:50.156 --> 14:53.292
So our bottle now retails
for $38.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.328
It has 10 to 12
servings in it,

14:55.428 --> 14:58.231
and it costs us $6.50
to make.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.800
Our spritz costs us $1.25
to make.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.002
In six months,
that will be 70 cents only.

15:03.102 --> 15:05.037
And it retails for $5.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.906
O'Leary:
Let's talk about the business.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.842
Hopefully, we're gonna hear
some great sales numbers.

15:09.942 --> 15:11.844
Last year was
our first calendar year,

15:11.944 --> 15:14.981
and we were 75% online

15:15.081 --> 15:17.316
because we were still kind of
on the tail end of COVID.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.086
And?
We made $2.5 million.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.120
- Whoa?
- What?

15:21.220 --> 15:22.955
- Mwah! <i>Magnifique!</i>
- Yes.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.591
How did you sell
that $2.5 million?
Did you make any money
on that $2.5 million?

15:25.691 --> 15:27.460
We just launched
with an Instagram post.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.362
That's it?
And it took off.
What?

15:29.462 --> 15:30.963
O'Leary:
And so did you make any money

15:31.063 --> 15:32.732
on that $2.5 million
last year?

15:32.832 --> 15:36.302
Not yet, but we invested
very heavily into this year.

15:36.402 --> 15:39.071
And we have a two-year path
to profitability.
How much did you lose
last year?

15:39.172 --> 15:40.940
A little under
a million dollars.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.475
- Ow!
- Ohh.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.377
You lost a million dollars?
How much did you put in?

15:44.477 --> 15:47.313
Well, we have a million
dollars' worth of inventory.

15:47.413 --> 15:48.314
How much did you raise?

15:48.414 --> 15:50.850
We had raised
$3.5 million.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.319
- Oh!
- Oh!

15:53.419 --> 15:56.389
And we're currently
raising $6.5 million.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.024
So, Melanie,
who did you raise...
Oy!

15:58.124 --> 16:01.227
...what was the valuation
at $3.5 million raise?

16:01.327 --> 16:04.497
Well, the first $900,000
was a SAFE

16:04.597 --> 16:07.500
at $7.5 million.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.737
Your first $900,000
that you raised pre-revenue?

16:11.838 --> 16:13.840
Yes. It was everyone
I had ever worked for.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.341
I worked very hard.

16:15.441 --> 16:18.811
You know, I worked for
companies like sweetgreen and Glossier.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.046
I worked at Goldman Sachs.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.281
And the people that had
seen my work before--

16:22.381 --> 16:24.217
How much do you still own
of the business?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.185
I still own 57%
of the business

16:26.285 --> 16:28.354
after this $6.5 million round.

16:28.454 --> 16:31.924
Wow, that's impressive.
What valuation is
the $6.5 million round at?

16:32.024 --> 16:34.560
It's a $35 million
pre-money valuation.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.962
- What?!
- What?!
- Holy!

16:36.062 --> 16:38.231
So $41 million--
By our numbers, $41 million.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.032
'Cause that's pre-money
versus post-money.
Yes.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.902
O'Leary: $41 million?
What's sales gonna be this
year?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.871
$4.5 million,
doubling next year.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.673
Wait.
I need an alcoholic drink.

16:47.773 --> 16:49.041
Like, are you kidding?

16:49.141 --> 16:52.144
And, Melanie,
why are you offering us...

16:52.245 --> 16:54.213
$250,000 for 5%?

16:54.313 --> 16:56.482
And if I did the numbers,

16:56.582 --> 16:59.552
you're giving us
a $5 million valuation today.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.722
Like, I'm just trying
to understand that conversation

17:02.822 --> 17:06.158
with the people you're
pitching it to at $40
million... Yes, yes.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.427
...and then telling them
you're giving it to us at $5
million.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.896
Yes, well, you know,

17:09.996 --> 17:12.832
this equity is directly
coming out of my shares.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.033
Which is smart.
Good for you. Yeah.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.401
I want someone
to come in

17:15.501 --> 17:18.771
and help me build this
into a huge business.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.940
We launched in the depths
of the pandemic.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.143
So we've already overcome,
you know, a lot of hurdles.

17:24.243 --> 17:27.613
Currently, we're sold
in 750 accounts.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.449
I personally reached out to
at least 400 of these accounts

17:30.550 --> 17:31.784
myself on Instagram
during COVID.

17:31.884 --> 17:32.852
Good for you,
good for you.

17:32.952 --> 17:34.086
2020,
there was no other way.

17:34.186 --> 17:37.056
And I said, "Hey, like,
I'm making this drink.

17:37.156 --> 17:38.391
You're a chef
I really admire.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.592
I would love to send you
a bottle.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.394
Will you please try it
and give me feedback?"

17:41.494 --> 17:44.263
I really believe nonalcoholic
drinks are the future...
Smart thing to do.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.065
...and every restaurant
in a few years

17:46.165 --> 17:48.000
will have
nonalcoholic menus.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.536
And I really hope that you'll
join me on this adventure.

17:50.636 --> 17:51.637
Here's my thought
about this.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.340
So I think you're
super impressive

17:54.440 --> 17:55.942
to raise
that amount of money,

17:56.042 --> 17:58.778
and you're one of the few
that came in

17:58.878 --> 18:00.780
to show us the value
that <i>we</i> add.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.149
But I unfortunately
can't drink this.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.350
I have acid reflux.

18:04.450 --> 18:07.286
I want to be in this,
but I can't 'cause I don't--

18:07.386 --> 18:09.755
I can't drink the stuff,
so I'm out.

18:09.855 --> 18:11.090
Well, thank you very much.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.660
Listen, Melanie,
you are amazing.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.263
For me,
when I invest in something,

18:17.363 --> 18:21.100
I have to be able
to partake in it.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.270
And unfortunately, Daymond and
I have something similar.

18:24.370 --> 18:27.940
I cannot eat citrus
or bitter things.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.575
It just affects me.

18:29.675 --> 18:32.445
And I'm just so sorry about
that because I love you.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.779
That's okay.
I wish you good luck.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.381
Thank you so much.
But unfortunately, I'm out.

18:35.481 --> 18:36.816
Thank you, Lori.

18:36.916 --> 18:42.388
Melanie, the category you
chose is one of the hardest ever

18:42.488 --> 18:45.157
because it's either expensive
to ship them,

18:45.257 --> 18:47.059
it's expensive
to store them,

18:47.159 --> 18:50.663
it's expensive to get shelf
space for them and to keep it.

18:50.763 --> 18:54.000
Getting to $50 million in
sales to really have an impact

18:54.100 --> 18:57.303
is gonna cost you
$50 million to $100 million.

18:57.403 --> 19:00.006
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

19:00.106 --> 19:02.241
Thank you very much.
Look, Mark's right.

19:02.341 --> 19:05.911
You've somehow picked the
hardest category to get into,

19:06.012 --> 19:08.047
and you're killing it.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.650
Melanie, I'll give you
the $250,000

19:10.750 --> 19:13.552
and I'll give it to you...

19:13.653 --> 19:15.354
for the 5%.

19:15.454 --> 19:18.858
That's my offer.
Do we have a deal?

19:18.958 --> 19:21.227
Wait.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.628
You may get an offer
from someone

19:22.728 --> 19:24.397
who's actually
in this business.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.601
You're in
the wine business?
Yep, I sure am.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.302
'Cause, you know,
there's no alcohol in this.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.004
Well, do you want to hear
my offer or not?

19:32.104 --> 19:33.873
With all due respect
to Kevin--
You're gonna get
a second offer.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.341
Melanie,
I don't want to argue.

19:35.441 --> 19:38.110
I don't want to negotiate
against other people.

19:38.210 --> 19:39.545
I'm making a bet on you.
Do you want to hear
another offer or not?

19:39.645 --> 19:42.682
I'll give you the $250,000
for exactly what you asked for.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.351
If you don't want that offer,
I'm happy to step out

19:45.451 --> 19:47.386
and you can negotiate
with Kevin.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.724
I feel like it's not fair
not to hear everyone out.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.225
- I think that's reasonable.
- Ooh. Ooh.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.794
Is that okay?
You may not like my offer.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.128
Melanie, I'm out.

19:56.228 --> 19:58.397
Ooh.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.166
Ouch.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.201
I'm giving you exactly
what you asked for.

20:02.301 --> 20:03.903
He's right, Melanie.
He's right.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.771
I mean, at a certain point,
you got to decide,

20:05.871 --> 20:07.339
as an entrepreneur,
why did you come here?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.375
Because I think
if someone comes in here

20:09.475 --> 20:11.343
and I give them exactly
what they're looking for...
You're right, Robert.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.812
...and then they want
to hear more,

20:12.912 --> 20:14.880
I'm not sure where
that conversation's going.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.550
So all due respect.
I wish you all the best.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.918
Good luck.
O'Leary: Thank you.

20:19.018 --> 20:22.688
So my offer isn't gonna change
because of what happened here.

20:22.788 --> 20:26.192
Absolutely.
So I know what I'm worth.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.760
I also know that
I'm in this business,

20:27.860 --> 20:29.328
and I also know
this category.

20:29.428 --> 20:31.263
And everybody's talking
about how difficult it is,

20:31.363 --> 20:34.100
and they're right,
but I'm not doing it for 5%.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.434
I'm too valuable.
Oh!

20:35.534 --> 20:37.470
Ooh!
I want 10%.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.739
- Oh!
- Oof!

20:39.839 --> 20:42.108
Your valuation
just got crushed.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.375
- Oof.
- Oh!

20:43.476 --> 20:46.545
Because I have to get up
in the morning and work on this.

20:46.645 --> 20:48.147
Ohh.
I do.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.448
You can moan
and groan all you want.

20:49.548 --> 20:50.916
Have another drink.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.418
You costed her
her deal with Robert.
I'm sorry, Melanie.

20:52.518 --> 20:53.986
I'm the only Shark

20:54.086 --> 20:56.155
that is Chef Wonderful
and Mr. Wonderful.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.523
That's my brand.
That's my business.
I know.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.492
That's why you should give
her, you know, a million for that.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.026
Yeah.
You can say anything you want.
You're out.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.128
What do you think,
Melanie?

21:02.228 --> 21:03.429
That's true.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.297
I'm not in a position
to accept an offer like that

21:05.397 --> 21:06.832
without doing wrong
to the people

21:06.932 --> 21:08.467
that have supported me
from the beginning.
She has 57%.

21:08.567 --> 21:09.969
So I unfortunately--
It's your stock.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.470
She has 57%.
Yeah, she has 57%.

21:11.570 --> 21:12.772
- That puts her under 50%.
- That puts her under.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.440
- She's not gonna go under 50%.
- That puts me under 50%.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.808
She can do
whatever she wants.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.543
You knew that already, Kevin.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.478
I'm doing it for 10%.

21:23.415 --> 21:25.885
I'm honored,
but I can't accept it.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.020
Good for you, Melanie.
Thank you, Melanie.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.855
Good luck, Melanie.
Thank you so much.

21:29.955 --> 21:30.890
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.057
Bye.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.329
I walked away without a deal.

21:37.429 --> 21:40.366
You know, I feel like it was
fair to hear everyone out.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.902
And I took the risk,
and I don't know if Robert

21:43.002 --> 21:44.737
will regret backing out
of that offer.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.572
But, you know, I hope

21:46.672 --> 21:48.974
he lets other people speak
in the future.

21:49.074 --> 21:50.142
I think she made a mistake, Robert.

21:50.242 --> 21:51.310
She should have
taken your offer, for sure.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.012
I think she made
a big mistake.

21:53.112 --> 21:56.582
Rule number one in sales,
when you get the order--

21:56.682 --> 21:58.751
Robert,
what does ABC stand for?

21:58.851 --> 22:00.119
Always be closing, baby.
Thank you, and we're out.

22:00.219 --> 22:03.756
And rule number two in
business-- never trust Kevin.

22:16.202 --> 22:18.270
Next up is a vibrant art form

22:18.370 --> 22:20.506
from the entrepreneur's
homeland.

22:29.815 --> 22:31.183
Sharks.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.686
My name is Sofi.
I live in St. Louis, Missouri.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.021
But I'm originally
from Senegal, West Africa.

22:36.121 --> 22:40.192
I'm here seeking $500,000 in
exchange for 10% of my company.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.228
I was born into the world
of tribe,

22:42.328 --> 22:43.429
and in the world of tribe,

22:43.529 --> 22:45.397
weaving is passed down generationally

22:45.497 --> 22:48.267
from grandmothers to mothers
to daughters to granddaughters.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.370
Senegal is full of joy, color,
laughter, and life.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.606
Senegal is brimming
with abundance.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.140
But when I first came
to the States,

22:55.241 --> 22:58.878
I was shocked to learn that
many people's perception of Africa

22:58.978 --> 23:00.713
was so interwoven
with poverty.

23:00.813 --> 23:04.250
This was such a stark contrast
from the place that I grew up.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.719
I wanted to weave my heritage
into an art form

23:06.819 --> 23:09.221
that told the true story
of African craftsmanship.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.957
That's why I created
Expedition Subsahara.

23:12.057 --> 23:15.194
Our beautiful, vibrant baskets
are made by artisans in Senegal,

23:15.294 --> 23:17.663
all by hand and with love.

23:17.763 --> 23:21.433
Our mission-- to interject
joy, color, and culture

23:21.533 --> 23:23.936
into every home
with our handcrafted storage

23:24.036 --> 23:25.371
and home decor solutions.

23:25.471 --> 23:28.440
And with Expedition Subsahara,
I'm dedicated to giving back

23:28.540 --> 23:30.342
to the very community
that raised me.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.578
Now, I know that
I'm standing amongst Sharks,

23:32.678 --> 23:34.146
but make no mistake--

23:34.246 --> 23:36.582
- I...am a lion.
- Grr.

23:36.682 --> 23:37.683
Now, who's ready to join me

23:37.783 --> 23:39.251
in transforming
the home goods space

23:39.351 --> 23:40.686
by banishing boring storage

23:40.786 --> 23:44.456
and making this world a more
cultured, more colorful place,

23:44.556 --> 23:46.625
one happy basket at a time?

23:46.725 --> 23:48.027
Sharks, in front of you,

23:48.127 --> 23:50.129
you'll find your very own
Expedition Subsahara baskets

23:50.229 --> 23:54.266
so that you, too, can add
some color in your lives.

23:54.366 --> 23:55.567
Rawr!

23:55.668 --> 23:57.803
So, tell us about--
is there a purpose for each
one?

23:57.903 --> 23:59.238
'Cause we have three
different shapes here.

23:59.338 --> 24:01.840
Yeah. We've taken
our traditional craftsmanship,

24:01.941 --> 24:04.576
and we've made
modern vessels.

24:04.677 --> 24:07.346
They're beautiful.
The big one, for example,
is actually our bestseller,

24:07.446 --> 24:09.815
and it's used mostly
for a hamper.

24:09.915 --> 24:11.317
And these
are handwoven?

24:11.417 --> 24:12.685
They're all handwoven. Wow.

24:12.785 --> 24:13.786
In Senegal?

24:13.886 --> 24:15.421
And you import them in?
Yes.

24:15.521 --> 24:16.689
And what's it made out of?

24:16.789 --> 24:19.124
Like, it reminds me
of lanyard string.

24:19.224 --> 24:22.528
So they're actually made from
a sweet grass, elephant grass.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.029
We use a variety of grasses.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.765
And then all the color you see
is from recycled plastics.

24:26.865 --> 24:27.967
Yeah. 'Kay.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.668
And what does it cost?

24:29.768 --> 24:31.837
How much would
this particular one cost?

24:31.937 --> 24:35.007
Now, it would probably cost,
fully landed, $18,

24:35.107 --> 24:37.476
and we sell it for $50.
And how do you sell it?

24:37.576 --> 24:39.845
That's a fair price.
Do you sell it online?
Do you sell it through retail?

24:39.945 --> 24:40.913
Tell us about your sales.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.781
We sell 95% online.

24:42.881 --> 24:45.417
Our total sales today
is $900,000.

24:45.517 --> 24:46.285
Wow!
For this year?

24:46.385 --> 24:47.419
For this year.
$900,000?

24:47.519 --> 24:48.754
- Wow!
- Wow!

24:48.854 --> 24:50.089
$900,000.
Sofi, I was not
expecting that answer.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.156
- Wow!
- Whoa!

24:51.256 --> 24:52.491
- Nice.
- Wow. Wow, wow!

24:52.591 --> 24:53.625
Nice!
Good for you!

24:53.726 --> 24:56.295
Actually, lifetime,
we've made $3.6 million.

24:56.395 --> 24:57.863
Oh.
Oh, my God!

24:57.963 --> 24:59.865
What did you do last year,
Sofi?
Last year?

24:59.965 --> 25:03.068
Lifetime.
Last year, we did $1.6
million.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.203
You are selling

25:04.303 --> 25:05.871
- a lot of baskets.
- Wow!

25:05.971 --> 25:08.841
Sofi, does everybody--
O'Leary: So, Sofi, last year,
$1.6 million.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.642
What did you make on that?
What profit?

25:10.743 --> 25:13.545
So, our gross profit
was over a million dollars. Wow.

25:13.645 --> 25:15.214
Wow.
What are
your margins typically?

25:15.314 --> 25:16.682
About 60%.
60%?

25:16.782 --> 25:18.417
Yeah.
So what's your overhead?

25:18.517 --> 25:20.319
Do you, like, not spend
any money on anything?

25:20.419 --> 25:21.620
So that's our gross profit.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.555
So I reinvested
into the company quite a bit.

25:23.655 --> 25:26.291
Okay, so gross profits
was $1 million.

25:26.392 --> 25:27.726
What was your net profit?
What was your net profit?

25:27.826 --> 25:29.361
How much did your...?
$75,000.

25:29.461 --> 25:30.763
$75,000?
$75,000. Okay.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.064
- Whoa.
- Whoa.
- Oh.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.366
So let me take you back, actually.

25:34.466 --> 25:39.004
In 2019,
we only did $75,000 in sales.

25:39.104 --> 25:41.607
When the pandemic hit,
people weren't buying baskets.

25:41.707 --> 25:45.878
So in March 2020,
we made $4,000 in sales,

25:45.978 --> 25:47.413
and I thought about
closing the business

25:47.513 --> 25:49.114
because I couldn't sustain it.

25:49.214 --> 25:53.652
Then from March 2020
to May 2020,

25:53.752 --> 25:57.523
we did $45,000 in sales. Wow.

25:57.623 --> 26:01.160
So, unfortunately,
George Floyd was murdered.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.930
And with George Floyd's murder
came a huge rise

26:05.030 --> 26:06.632
through the Black Lives Matter movement

26:06.732 --> 26:09.568
to uplift Black businesses,

26:09.668 --> 26:12.771
and I saw a huge shift
in my business.

26:12.871 --> 26:14.406
That's awesome.
O'Leary: That's good.

26:14.506 --> 26:17.876
So I had to ramp up production
really fast.

26:17.976 --> 26:21.513
I had to bring in weavers--
120 of them, to be exact.

26:21.613 --> 26:23.248
So I had to pay them fairly.

26:23.348 --> 26:24.716
I had to make sure

26:24.817 --> 26:27.553
that the places where they
were weaving were taken care of.

26:27.653 --> 26:29.321
I had to make sure
that the farmers had cars

26:29.421 --> 26:30.756
to bring the grasses.

26:30.856 --> 26:34.593
So basically our margins
kind of dwindled

26:34.693 --> 26:37.362
because we had
a bunch of overhead

26:37.463 --> 26:39.264
that we didn't have
the previous year.

26:39.364 --> 26:41.100
Got it.
Because it was
a mom-and-pop shop.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.369
Sofi, are you saying
that you're paying the weavers

26:44.470 --> 26:45.604
on a flat wage?

26:45.704 --> 26:46.905
I just made the assumption

26:47.005 --> 26:49.141
you were paying them
on a piece basis.

26:49.241 --> 26:50.542
No, we're doing
this differently.

26:50.642 --> 26:52.244
Normally
that would be the way,

26:52.344 --> 26:55.614
but we're paying them
so that they are our weavers.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.684
O'Leary:
Not all of them are going to
be as productive as the others.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.086
Why don't you just pay
by the piece?

27:01.186 --> 27:03.222
What we're going to do is take
the master weavers

27:03.322 --> 27:05.958
and make sure that they have
someone underneath them

27:06.058 --> 27:07.059
who can learn from them.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.427
What's
the competition doing?

27:08.527 --> 27:10.896
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

27:10.996 --> 27:13.732
The problem is that's the way
it's always been done,

27:13.832 --> 27:15.734
and that has done nothing
for my community.

27:15.834 --> 27:18.937
Those baby weavers are going
to end up being master weavers.

27:19.037 --> 27:21.140
They have to learn
from a master just like I
did... Cuban: Good for you, Sofi.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.675
...so that people have
a living wage.
O'Leary: You're saying
you have to do it--

27:23.775 --> 27:25.277
So we're doing it in a way
that is different.
Good for you, Sofi.

27:25.377 --> 27:27.079
Good for you.
Good for you.
Yes. Yes. Yes.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.615
Good for you.
Sofi, what did you spend
on advertising last year?

27:29.715 --> 27:33.018
Last year,
I spent $400,000 on advertising.

27:33.118 --> 27:34.786
O'Leary: Whoa!
Whoa.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.622
So that's where
the profit goes.

27:36.722 --> 27:38.223
Tell us about your numbers
last month.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.527
Yes. So, last month,
we did $160,000 in sales.

27:41.627 --> 27:43.996
So your average sale
was how much?

27:44.096 --> 27:45.197
$206.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.198
$206.
Yes.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.433
Your margins are 60%.
Yeah.

27:48.534 --> 27:51.103
And then it costs you
how much to acquire a
customer?

27:51.203 --> 27:55.807
It costs me about $116
to acquire a customer.

27:55.908 --> 27:58.210
Ay. You only have
five bucks left. Yeah.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.478
That's a break-even business.
That's your problem
right there.

27:59.578 --> 28:01.380
Yeah. That's my problem is
for customer acquisition.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.482
Right, but so what I think--
So, you're
losing money right now.

28:03.582 --> 28:04.917
So last month,
you lost money.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.419
We don't lose money.
We kind of just break even.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.987
Where do you see
the scalability now

28:09.087 --> 28:12.624
that you set up these systems
and people in place?

28:12.724 --> 28:14.126
These are all online.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.794
Right now,
it is harder and harder

28:15.894 --> 28:17.729
to acquire a customer
the way that we're doing it.

28:17.829 --> 28:19.398
So what I need to do

28:19.498 --> 28:22.701
is get these baskets
to the masses through retail.

28:22.801 --> 28:24.670
Oh!
Oh. You wanna go retail?

28:24.770 --> 28:26.071
Now you want to
go to retail.

28:26.171 --> 28:27.072
Ay.
Whoa.

28:27.172 --> 28:28.507
O'Leary: For
every customer you acquire,

28:28.607 --> 28:29.875
you're actually
losing money.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.977
And I think
that's a big problem.

28:32.077 --> 28:34.112
I don't like retail for this
'cause it's going to tie up

28:34.213 --> 28:36.415
a ton of capital
in inventory.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.617
I'm sorry.
This is not a business for me.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.319
I'm out.

28:40.419 --> 28:41.553
Okay. Thank you, Kevin.

28:41.653 --> 28:44.022
I love your mission
and what you're doing.

28:44.122 --> 28:47.893
I think your valuation--
I never talk valuation,

28:47.993 --> 28:50.429
but the valuation for me
is a little off here,

28:50.529 --> 28:52.197
and you're figuring
so much out.

28:52.297 --> 28:54.266
So I wish you good luck,
but I'm sorry.

28:54.366 --> 28:55.300
I'm out.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.969
I understand. Thank you.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.638
Sofi, you're in
a difficult spot.

28:59.738 --> 29:00.939
But, Mark...
Go ahead.

29:01.039 --> 29:02.541
...before you say anything,

29:02.641 --> 29:05.677
I started
this business with $500.

29:05.777 --> 29:08.547
$500 to $3.6 million.

29:08.647 --> 29:10.249
I have never had a loan.

29:10.349 --> 29:13.685
I've never had any
sort of debt, period.

29:13.785 --> 29:16.088
That's amazing.
I took that $500,

29:16.188 --> 29:17.556
and I just turned it,
and I turned it,

29:17.656 --> 29:18.624
and I turned it.

29:18.724 --> 29:21.159
Imagine what I could do--
imagine--

29:21.260 --> 29:23.328
with a Shark by my side.

29:23.428 --> 29:26.298
I think you operate better
as a sole proprietorship

29:26.398 --> 29:28.000
where you
don't have investors

29:28.100 --> 29:29.935
because you have
complete flexibility.

29:30.035 --> 29:32.704
And coming in asking
for $500,000

29:32.804 --> 29:34.072
makes it really difficult
to say,

29:34.172 --> 29:36.708
okay, I know exactly how
I'm going to get a return.

29:36.808 --> 29:37.843
I just don't see that.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.544
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.816
Sofi,
you know, at $500,000,

29:44.916 --> 29:47.919
you're asking me
to make a bet on the business.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.756
I'm asking you to make
a bet on <i>me.</i>

29:50.856 --> 29:54.059
Every single person
who's ever bet on me has won.

29:54.159 --> 29:56.194
And I promise you,
you will never have somebody

29:56.295 --> 29:57.963
who can work as hard as I can.

29:58.063 --> 30:00.932
I don't sleep.
I run the ads.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.702
I pack the boxes.
I still weave when I need to.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.772
I will work like a lion.

30:06.872 --> 30:08.473
I promise you.

30:10.108 --> 30:12.244
Bet on me.

30:12.344 --> 30:15.547
There's a difference
between me betting on
<i>you</i>--

30:15.647 --> 30:16.948
'cause
I'm willing to do that.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.885
Betting on Sofi--
I'm in, baby.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.820
I'm in all day long.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.989
There's no doubt in my mind
you're going to make it.

30:24.089 --> 30:27.092
But as an investment
at half a million, I just...

30:27.192 --> 30:30.028
I just can't do it
'cause I don't see the return.

30:30.128 --> 30:31.663
Not the return on Sofi.

30:31.763 --> 30:32.998
I'm sorry. I'm out.

30:33.098 --> 30:36.301
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.

30:36.401 --> 30:40.939
You know, you said something
that most people don't
realize.

30:41.039 --> 30:45.644
The only people in history
who have ever changed the world

30:45.744 --> 30:48.647
are the people
who never have accepted

30:48.747 --> 30:49.815
somebody saying,

30:49.915 --> 30:52.651
"That's the way
it's always been done."

30:53.885 --> 30:56.021
And that is probably one of
the most dangerous statements

30:56.121 --> 30:58.123
in the world
that anybody says,

30:58.223 --> 31:01.159
to have you accept the way
it's always been done.

31:01.259 --> 31:02.494
And as long as
you keep doing that,

31:02.594 --> 31:03.695
I believe you're
going to be okay.

31:03.795 --> 31:06.131
This is not
an investment for me.

31:06.231 --> 31:07.666
I'm out.

31:07.766 --> 31:08.734
- Thank you, Sofi.
- Thank you.

31:08.834 --> 31:09.768
Thank you, Sofi.
Well done.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.303
Thank you.
Good luck, Sofi.
Well done.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.604
Thank you.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.643
I have never failed
betting on myself,

31:18.744 --> 31:20.312
so we're going to continue
and I'm going to continue

31:20.412 --> 31:22.614
betting on my culture,
betting on my weavers.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.015
We are going to
take over the world

31:24.116 --> 31:26.518
one happy basket at a time.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.698
Next up is a better version

31:39.798 --> 31:42.167
of an often-neglected
household item.

31:51.376 --> 31:52.644
Hi, Sharks.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.414
My name is Winston Mok,
and I'm the founder of Woosh.

31:55.514 --> 31:59.317
I'm seeking $500,000
for 10% in my company.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.086
Sharks, when was the last time

32:01.186 --> 32:03.121
you changed
your home's air filter?

32:03.221 --> 32:05.190
If you're like most people,
it's been a while

32:05.290 --> 32:06.625
since you thought
about your filter,

32:06.725 --> 32:12.063
and there's a good chance
it looks like this.

32:12.164 --> 32:15.467
Ew!
Isn't that
absolutely disgusting?

32:15.567 --> 32:19.404
As filters get dirty,
they stop working.

32:19.504 --> 32:21.473
And what
this doesn't catch,

32:21.573 --> 32:24.643
you and your loved ones
are breathing in.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.011
This includes pollen,

32:26.111 --> 32:30.415
pet dander,
mold, smoke, bacteria, and...

32:30.515 --> 32:31.450
Ew.

32:31.550 --> 32:32.517
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

32:32.617 --> 32:33.819
...even COVID.

32:33.919 --> 32:36.087
And that's why I created...

32:36.188 --> 32:38.390
Woosh--
a better air filter

32:38.490 --> 32:41.259
that's smart enough to know
when it needs to be changed.

32:43.995 --> 32:45.564
Let me show you how it works.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.934
The smart air filter
is made of two parts--

32:49.000 --> 32:52.170
a filter
and a reusable frame.

32:52.270 --> 32:55.106
The filter is made from
the highest-quality materials

32:55.207 --> 32:56.942
and is placed
inside the frame.

32:57.042 --> 32:59.144
Huh.

32:59.244 --> 33:03.014
The filter connects to Wi-Fi
and has integrated sensors

33:03.114 --> 33:04.883
that track the performance
of your filter.

33:04.983 --> 33:09.120
So when it's time to change,
we send a notification

33:09.221 --> 33:11.756
and a filter replacement
in the mail.

33:11.857 --> 33:14.025
With Woosh,
it's easier to use,

33:14.125 --> 33:16.628
smart,
and produces less waste

33:16.728 --> 33:19.598
than traditional
cardboard filters.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.900
So, Sharks, who's with me

33:22.000 --> 33:26.238
to <i>whoosh</i>
for smarter, cleaner air?

33:26.338 --> 33:27.739
There's
no intelligence to this.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.709
No, there's smarts in it.
There's electronics built in.

33:30.809 --> 33:33.845
We have integrated sensors
that connect to Wi-Fi.

33:33.945 --> 33:36.848
It actually checks to see--
it looks at the airflow,

33:36.948 --> 33:38.016
and we actually measure

33:38.116 --> 33:40.151
the performance of your filter accurately,

33:40.252 --> 33:42.354
so we can see
when it's time to be changed.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.756
So you've designed
a better mousetrap. Yes.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.492
And what made you come up
with this idea? Why a filter?

33:47.592 --> 33:52.364
So, it was the wildfires
in California that, in 2019,

33:52.464 --> 33:53.732
my partner,
she came to me and said,

33:53.832 --> 33:56.501
"Oh, you know,
we've got to be worried, like,

33:56.601 --> 33:58.203
should we get a purifier,
should we get some stuff?"

33:58.303 --> 33:59.538
And I said,
"Oh, yeah, for sure."

33:59.638 --> 34:02.407
I'm kind of frugal,
so I really wanted to make one.

34:02.507 --> 34:04.075
So I went on YouTube
and learned how to make one

34:04.175 --> 34:05.977
from a box fan and a filter.

34:06.077 --> 34:08.146
And when I got the filter--
When I ordered the filter,

34:08.246 --> 34:11.283
it was 25 bucks to ship,
and it's a high-quality
filter,

34:11.383 --> 34:12.484
but I was sitting there going,

34:12.584 --> 34:14.252
"Man, you know,
why is this so expensive?"

34:14.352 --> 34:16.288
So half of that cost
is actually shipping.

34:16.388 --> 34:17.956
So I thought to myself,
"Wouldn't it be cool

34:18.056 --> 34:20.191
if, like, I could change this
and ship it for a lot less?"

34:20.292 --> 34:22.827
So, are you a tech guy?
A software guy?

34:22.928 --> 34:24.095
What's your background
pre...?

34:24.195 --> 34:26.565
Pre this,
I grew up in Canada,

34:26.665 --> 34:28.633
and so...
Go, Canada!

34:28.733 --> 34:31.803
...I took the opportunity
to move to the U. S.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.805
I joined Google
as a product manager.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.874
Have you left Google?
I have left Google last year.

34:35.974 --> 34:37.375
Wow.
Are you doing this
full time?

34:37.475 --> 34:39.811
I've been doing this full time
for over a year now.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.047
O'Leary: Let's go in a
different direction for a
second. Yes.

34:42.147 --> 34:44.449
$500,000 for 10%

34:44.549 --> 34:46.217
imputes
a $5 million valuation.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.986
Yes.
I think
the product has merit.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.788
Please tell me
you have sales.

34:49.888 --> 34:51.189
So we are pre revenue.

34:53.291 --> 34:55.760
But let me see
if I can save myself here.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.363
We raised $62,000
two months ago.

34:58.463 --> 34:59.931
And what's most important is,
last month,

35:00.031 --> 35:02.567
we signed our first
partnership with Emerson,

35:02.667 --> 35:04.169
the Sensi smart thermostat.

35:04.269 --> 35:08.106
This is a Fortune 200,
130-year-old HVAC giant.

35:08.206 --> 35:09.808
Huge.
And they're huge.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.443
And so I'll tell you
what they see in us.
What's the partnership?

35:11.543 --> 35:13.244
How does it work?
Partnership is they want

35:13.345 --> 35:15.447
to bundle our product
with their smart thermostat.

35:15.547 --> 35:16.781
Oh, now
that's interesting.

35:16.881 --> 35:18.583
What's your unique
selling proposition on this?

35:18.683 --> 35:19.818
You ultimately know

35:19.918 --> 35:21.586
exactly when you need to
change your air filter.

35:21.686 --> 35:23.955
What's really important
is we have an add-on

35:24.055 --> 35:25.857
for the growing number
of homes

35:25.957 --> 35:28.627
that are moving towards
smart thermostats.

35:28.727 --> 35:31.329
We have an integration that
transforms your entire--

35:31.429 --> 35:34.399
your home's HVAC,
or the heating and cooling unit,

35:34.499 --> 35:36.167
into a smart air purifier.

35:36.267 --> 35:39.771
How does it do that?
What we do is we have a...

35:39.871 --> 35:43.341
air-quality monitor
that's paired with our filter.

35:43.441 --> 35:45.543
It sends a signal
to your smart thermostat to say,

35:45.644 --> 35:47.012
"Hey, air quality is poor."

35:47.112 --> 35:49.748
And what happens is
the monitor goes red.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.651
It then sends a signal
to your smart thermostat

35:52.751 --> 35:54.019
and says,
"Circulate the air."

35:54.119 --> 35:56.287
Clever.
But what do you sell
this to somebody online

35:56.388 --> 35:58.123
for right now
if they wanted to buy it?

35:58.223 --> 36:00.458
Right.
Right now we sell

36:00.558 --> 36:03.728
this frame and the filter
for $99.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.330
What does
the filter itself cost

36:05.430 --> 36:06.498
after I've paid the $100?
What do the... cost?
Yeah.

36:06.598 --> 36:07.966
$20.

36:08.066 --> 36:10.535
O'Leary: And then, what does
it cost you to make the $20
filter?

36:10.635 --> 36:13.571
Our costs, we have a 33%
margin, and it's shipped.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.140
So it shows up at your door.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.976
I'm going to guess that
there's some very large filter players

36:18.076 --> 36:19.744
that already dominate
this market... Yes.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.146
...'cause it's
an industrial market

36:21.246 --> 36:22.914
that's been around
for decades. Right.

36:23.014 --> 36:27.385
Now, what stops them
from just doing the same thing

36:27.485 --> 36:30.555
to the existing multibillion
dollar business they have

36:30.655 --> 36:33.258
and crushing you
like the filter roach you are?

36:33.358 --> 36:34.893
I know. I must look like
a filter roach.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.295
But I'll tell you something.
That's a great question.

36:37.395 --> 36:39.230
Do you have patents?
We have patents.

36:39.330 --> 36:40.265
They're patent pending.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.467
The biggest
filter manufacturers,

36:42.567 --> 36:43.968
I would say,
have reached out.

36:44.069 --> 36:45.970
They've deemed us noncompetitive,

36:46.071 --> 36:47.605
and they are now willing
to give us

36:47.706 --> 36:49.340
their brand, technology,
and manufacturing

36:49.441 --> 36:51.009
to make our filters.

36:51.109 --> 36:53.144
So is that a licensing deal
you're going to do with them?

36:53.244 --> 36:54.579
And this is licensing,
licensing, licensing.

36:54.679 --> 36:56.047
You've come
to the right place.

36:56.147 --> 36:57.315
Grasshopper will learn.

36:57.415 --> 36:58.650
From roach to grasshopper
I become.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.085
Oh, my God.
Oh, my Lord.

37:00.185 --> 37:01.386
Listen, Winston,
I've heard enough. Sure.

37:01.486 --> 37:02.520
I'm gonna make you
an offer.

37:02.620 --> 37:04.255
You're my favorite
filter roach.

37:04.355 --> 37:05.857
There's no question
about it.

37:05.957 --> 37:09.160
I'll give you the $500,000.
I want 12.5%.

37:09.260 --> 37:10.628
But wait--
there's more.

37:10.729 --> 37:14.132
I want 50 cents' royalty
on every filter.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.801
Oh.
When does
the royalty end?

37:16.901 --> 37:18.670
Never.
Oh.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.673
Well, maybe when you and I
are both dead.

37:21.773 --> 37:22.874
But wait--
there's more.
Maybe not.

37:22.974 --> 37:25.043
But wait-- there's more.
There's-- I--

37:25.143 --> 37:26.511
Thank you for the offer.

37:26.611 --> 37:29.214
I think what's really
important is right now,

37:29.314 --> 37:31.850
we're a startup,
we're growing.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.518
And...

37:33.618 --> 37:35.954
So, Winston,
there isn't enough

37:36.054 --> 37:39.390
in the value proposition
for me.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.092
And I'll tell you why.
Tell me why.

37:41.192 --> 37:43.495
It's really easy
to change a filter.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.863
People aren't doing it,

37:44.963 --> 37:47.365
and I'm not sure this is
going to compel them to do it.

37:47.465 --> 37:48.967
Let me see
if I can rope you in with--

37:49.067 --> 37:52.303
Well, I think you've got
an offer here from Mr.
O'Leary. Yeah.

37:52.403 --> 37:54.305
So I'm not your guy
for this one. Yeah.

37:54.405 --> 37:57.008
Wish you all the best.
"Woosh" away. I'm out.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.543
Understood.

37:58.643 --> 38:02.313
I don't really believe
that I can add any value to you,

38:02.413 --> 38:04.449
'cause I think you're off on a
good start with a good product.

38:04.549 --> 38:06.451
So I'm out. Alright.

38:06.551 --> 38:10.288
Winston, I think you're
amazing and incredibly brilliant.

38:10.388 --> 38:13.224
Unfortunately, I haven't heard
enough for me to gauge

38:13.324 --> 38:15.326
what's going to happen
with your patents.

38:15.426 --> 38:17.562
Because
I have some doubts,

38:17.662 --> 38:18.897
I'm not going to invest.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.365
I'm sorry. I'm out.

38:22.667 --> 38:23.902
I like the product,
I like you,

38:24.002 --> 38:26.504
I like the goal,
I like the mission, right?

38:26.604 --> 38:28.606
The problem is,
this is hard to sell.

38:28.706 --> 38:31.142
You're gonna have to spend a
boatload of money on marketing.

38:31.242 --> 38:33.344
Even if you partner
with the big companies,

38:33.444 --> 38:35.213
even if they use
all their outlets,

38:35.313 --> 38:37.115
it's still going to be
a hard sell.

38:37.215 --> 38:38.716
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

38:40.084 --> 38:41.719
Kevin,
let me ask you something.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.988
With all of us out
for various reasons,

38:44.088 --> 38:46.357
where are you finding
the value in this?

38:46.457 --> 38:50.495
Winston is a dual-patent guy
with sneakers on here.

38:50.595 --> 38:51.763
That's all you need to know.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.231
That's basically it.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.034
You have a really
tough negotiation ahead

38:56.134 --> 38:57.035
with these behemoths.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.903
You remind me of BenjiLock.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.039
We had to get two lock
companies competing with each other.

39:01.139 --> 39:03.208
My team worked on it
for over a year.

39:03.308 --> 39:04.843
It was a tremendous
amount of work.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.110
Now, unfortunately,

39:06.211 --> 39:07.745
I'm not doing it
for 12.5%.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.614
I want 15%.

39:11.382 --> 39:14.586
I feel a little insulted
that you just let me sit there

39:14.686 --> 39:16.387
listening to all
these Sharks squawking.

39:16.487 --> 39:19.557
And I want 50 cents
in perpetuity on each filter.

39:20.558 --> 39:24.829
There is Kevin with another
bloodsucking offer.

39:24.929 --> 39:26.764
The perpetuity
is obviously a challenge.

39:26.865 --> 39:27.966
I love that word.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.467
That's eating cash flow.

39:29.567 --> 39:30.568
It's a big risk.

39:30.668 --> 39:31.970
Either I'm going to
make a lot of money

39:32.070 --> 39:33.838
or I'm going to lose
$500,000.

39:33.938 --> 39:36.407
Winston, this is your moment.
I made you an offer.

39:36.507 --> 39:38.509
What do you want to do?

39:38.610 --> 39:39.577
Is there...?

39:39.677 --> 39:40.578
No.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.524
Four Sharks are out.

39:53.625 --> 39:58.029
Kevin has made an offer
of $500,000 for a 15% stake,

39:58.129 --> 40:01.032
plus a royalty of 50 cents
in perpetuity

40:01.132 --> 40:04.636
for Winston's
smart air filter company Woosh.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.639
But Winston is having trouble
with the royalty.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.174
I swear to you,
if you don't take this deal,

40:10.275 --> 40:12.110
I won't even remember
what Woosh is.

40:16.514 --> 40:20.985
50 cents on every filter
for perpetuity.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.453
He's insane.
You don't
have to do it, Winston.

40:22.553 --> 40:24.088
He's insane,
and you know it.
You do not have to do it.

40:24.188 --> 40:25.924
It's insane,
and you know it.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.393
Mark, if you believe--
Winston, you can counter
all you want.

40:28.493 --> 40:30.328
You do not believe, Mark.
I mean, Winston,
stop and take a moment.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.663
And, Lori, you passed.
Yeah, I believe

40:31.763 --> 40:33.231
that's the fastest way
to go out of business.

40:33.331 --> 40:35.500
It's not going to go
out of business...
But, Kevin...

40:35.600 --> 40:37.435
...because Mr. Wonderful
is helping the business grow.
...you're squeezing blood
out of a turnip.

40:37.535 --> 40:38.836
Exactly.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.806
The perpetuity
just locks me out.

40:41.906 --> 40:43.141
And I think
in the long term...

40:43.241 --> 40:45.576
You're
exactly right.
You know
what's gonna happen?

40:45.677 --> 40:48.046
In 36 months, we're going
to be sitting together...

40:48.146 --> 40:48.846
You'll be broke.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.148
...just like we were.

40:50.248 --> 40:52.083
You can make a counter.

40:52.183 --> 40:54.719
Can we work with the equity so
you have a stake in the
company?

40:54.819 --> 40:57.388
No, because, look,
it's so binary.

40:57.488 --> 40:59.490
It's such a small piece
of the company.

40:59.590 --> 41:01.092
My counter would be...

41:05.063 --> 41:07.265
I'll bring up the word
"perpetuity" again.

41:07.365 --> 41:09.000
Instead of perpetuity,

41:09.100 --> 41:12.103
lock me in for the royalty for...

41:12.203 --> 41:13.838
three years.

41:13.938 --> 41:17.108
What happens if it takes us
three years to negotiate a
deal?

41:17.208 --> 41:18.743
You're getting it
for that entire time or--

41:18.843 --> 41:20.778
But we have no sales, Winston.

41:20.878 --> 41:23.114
We've got you in the sneakers
and the two patents.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.149
The behemoth player

41:25.249 --> 41:26.718
is going to buy me out.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.187
They're not going to let me
keep the 50 cents.

41:29.287 --> 41:30.722
It's the only deal
I'm going to do.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.557
It's time for you
to make a decision.

41:32.657 --> 41:35.827
I'll do the royalty...

41:35.927 --> 41:39.364
but I'd be taking
a down round on the equity.

41:39.464 --> 41:41.799
Can you hold me
on my ask for the equity?

41:41.899 --> 41:44.335
I'll sign up with you
on the royalty for perpetuity.

41:44.435 --> 41:47.839
So what's your proposal?
With the perpetuity,

41:47.939 --> 41:51.042
the 500K, 10%, and you get
50 cents for every filter.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.011
So, if I stay at 10%
on the equity...

41:53.111 --> 41:54.946
Yes.
...you'll do
the 50-cent in perpetuity?

Mr. Wonderful called me
the filter roach,

but now
I'm the filter grasshopper,

42:23.608 --> 42:25.643
and now I'm going to learn
from the master.
