WEBVTT

00:02.033 --> 00:04.134
Here are all my receipts.

00:04.175 --> 00:05.425
Look, I don't
need these, Liz.

00:05.476 --> 00:07.210
Your tax return
is the same every year.

00:07.228 --> 00:08.561
Actually, I'll have you know

00:08.596 --> 00:11.514
that this has been
a year of change, Howard.

00:11.548 --> 00:13.099
I joined
an over-40 dance team,

00:13.150 --> 00:15.769
I started eating the lettuce on
my plate under my onion rings,

00:15.820 --> 00:19.356
and I have taken up meditation
thanks to my boyfriend Criss.

00:19.390 --> 00:22.993
Yeah, do you remember what
you said to me last year?

00:23.027 --> 00:25.412
This has been
a year of change, Howard.

00:25.446 --> 00:28.248
I'm actually eating the onion
part of my onion rings,

00:28.282 --> 00:31.034
I started journaling thanks
to my exciting relationship

00:31.068 --> 00:32.952
with Carol, who is a man.

00:33.004 --> 00:35.338
Although we have done nothing
that lesbians could not do.

00:35.373 --> 00:36.589
Uhhuh.

00:36.624 --> 00:38.008
Do you remember what
you said to me last year?

00:38.042 --> 00:40.243
I bought a restaurant-grade
onion ringer,

00:40.261 --> 00:42.178
and I'm having a go
at cycling,

00:42.213 --> 00:45.048
thanks to my boyfriend Wesley,
whom I hate.

00:45.082 --> 00:47.217
Have I never washed
this sweater?

00:47.251 --> 00:49.135
Look, there's nothing wrong
with being predictable.

00:49.186 --> 00:51.021
Every morning I get up
and come to this office

00:51.055 --> 00:52.806
while my wife cheats
on me with Jared.

00:52.857 --> 00:53.890
Well, you're wrong.

00:53.924 --> 00:56.026
I bought a meditation
stool, and...

00:56.060 --> 00:57.727
This year's gonna
be different.

01:03.534 --> 01:06.152
Jack, am I just in
a permanent rut?

01:06.203 --> 01:07.770
I don't have time for
your nonsense, Lemon.

01:07.788 --> 01:08.955
I'm working.

01:08.989 --> 01:10.457
I know this doesn't
look like work,

01:10.491 --> 01:11.708
but are you familiar with
the shower principle?

01:11.742 --> 01:12.942
I remember Mrs. Doyle

01:12.960 --> 01:14.210
pulling me aside
to talk about it

01:14.245 --> 01:15.945
- in the seventh grade.
- No.

01:15.963 --> 01:17.714
The shower principle is
a term scientists use

01:17.748 --> 01:20.133
to describe moments
of inspiration that occur

01:20.167 --> 01:22.252
when the brain is distracted
from the problem at hand.

01:22.286 --> 01:24.254
For example,
when you're showering.

01:24.288 --> 01:26.139
I was in the shower when
I finally got the title

01:26.173 --> 01:27.424
of the movie <i>Face off.</i>

01:27.458 --> 01:29.259
<i>Face</i> off,
face <i>off.</i>

01:29.293 --> 01:30.477
Exactly.

01:30.511 --> 01:32.679
If the cerebral cortex
is distracted,

01:32.730 --> 01:34.064
by showering or putting,

01:34.098 --> 01:35.982
then another part of the brain,

01:36.016 --> 01:38.685
the anterior superior
temporal gyrus is activated.

01:38.736 --> 01:42.739
This is the site of sudden
cognitive inspiration.

01:42.773 --> 01:44.974
Nerd alert,
nerd alert.

01:46.861 --> 01:49.312
The problem at hand
is this man,

01:49.330 --> 01:50.864
my boss, Hank Hooper.

01:50.898 --> 01:52.649
Kabletown has grown a lot

01:52.683 --> 01:55.585
over the years,
but it's still a family company

01:55.619 --> 01:57.754
with a very simple goal...

01:57.788 --> 01:59.139
To entertain folks.

01:59.173 --> 02:00.840
That's all people want.

02:00.875 --> 02:03.009
To sit on their sofas...

02:03.043 --> 02:04.427
Why am I putting on airs?

02:04.462 --> 02:05.929
To sit on their couches,

02:05.963 --> 02:07.997
and hear stories.
Here's one.

02:08.014 --> 02:09.916
1968.

02:09.949 --> 02:12.135
We were on patrol somewhere near
the Cambodian border.

02:12.169 --> 02:14.921
We can skip this part.

02:14.955 --> 02:16.606
So we boiled the skull,

02:16.640 --> 02:18.174
and made a tea kettle
out of it.

02:20.394 --> 02:23.730
My point is, I believe that
slow and steady wins the race.

02:23.764 --> 02:26.599
We don't take risks.
We make profits.

02:26.634 --> 02:30.620
So now, let's get this
dog fashion show started!

02:30.654 --> 02:33.356
"Everyone hide your bones."

02:33.374 --> 02:36.993
"Dogbeard the pirate
just sailed into woof harbor."

02:38.295 --> 02:39.546
You know what else Hank
announced at that meeting?

02:39.580 --> 02:40.747
Record profits.

02:40.781 --> 02:42.532
Really?
Can we start getting real soda?

02:42.550 --> 02:45.001
Because I think Corka-Coola
brand diet banana lime

02:45.035 --> 02:46.836
- causes "tum nungnuss."
- No.

02:46.870 --> 02:49.055
And do you know what Hank wants
to do with that money?

02:49.089 --> 02:50.890
Pay a shareholder dividend.

02:50.925 --> 02:54.177
Meanwhile, the Kabletown blimp
is in such disrepair,

02:54.211 --> 02:57.764
we got a "jeers"
in <i>Corporate Blimps Weekly.</i>

02:57.815 --> 03:00.049
I want to use that money
to transform this company,

03:00.067 --> 03:02.318
but first I have to convince
Hank Hooper,

03:02.353 --> 03:05.271
a white man
who still buys Cadillacs.

03:05.322 --> 03:08.724
I just need the right idea.

03:08.742 --> 03:11.077
Do you think
a year ago today

03:11.111 --> 03:13.246
we were having this
same conversation?

03:13.280 --> 03:14.531
Because it sure
feels like it.

03:14.565 --> 03:15.582
Probably.

03:15.616 --> 03:17.033
And knowing you,
as you were leaving

03:17.067 --> 03:19.536
you did something
comically undignified.

03:19.570 --> 03:22.288
Well, not this time, friend.

03:22.339 --> 03:25.124
- Gumballs!
- Lemon!

30 ROCK
S06 Ep15 - The shower principle

03:52.079 --> 03:55.579
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

03:59.210 --> 04:03.496
Why is all the healthy food
on the top shelf today?

04:03.547 --> 04:04.947
Cut it out, you perverts.

04:04.965 --> 04:06.049
I know what you're doing.

04:06.083 --> 04:07.617
It's the first warm
day of the year,

04:07.635 --> 04:09.952
and women are starting to take
off their winter clothes...

04:09.970 --> 04:11.588
Good morning!

04:11.622 --> 04:13.506
Eyes down here, boys.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.124
I have breasts, you know.

04:15.142 --> 04:16.125
Nope, Hazel.

04:16.142 --> 04:17.226
Button up.

04:17.261 --> 04:18.928
Cerie, put on one
of my soup ponchos.

04:18.962 --> 04:20.512
This happens every spring,

04:20.564 --> 04:22.181
and it makes Jenna feel
threatened, and old,

04:22.233 --> 04:23.566
and she takes it out on me

04:23.601 --> 04:24.567
and the show.

04:24.602 --> 04:27.020
Every year she...

04:27.071 --> 04:28.688
Every year.

04:28.739 --> 04:33.809
The same thing
happens every year.

04:33.827 --> 04:36.946
Take a picture,
it'll last longer.

04:36.980 --> 04:38.414
Here you go.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.538
Liz, at 11:00
we have...

04:45.589 --> 04:46.756
Our annual budget meeting.

04:46.790 --> 04:48.791
You know what I did
a year ago today?

04:48.825 --> 04:50.927
Met with my accountant,
went up to see Jack,

04:50.961 --> 04:53.096
told Cerie to cover herself up.

04:53.130 --> 04:54.681
Yeah, stop doing that.

04:54.715 --> 04:56.849
Paula canceled my subscription
to <i>shape</i> magazine.

04:56.884 --> 04:58.434
Why do you have
to take Cerie away too?

04:58.469 --> 04:59.552
'Cause Jenna's
gonna freak out,

04:59.603 --> 05:00.770
and she'll take it out on me.

05:00.804 --> 05:02.138
Last year,

05:02.172 --> 05:05.275
Jenna accused me
of trying to destroy her

05:05.309 --> 05:08.111
because her lines didn't
have any "K" sounds,

05:08.145 --> 05:09.845
which she thinks
is the funniest sound.

05:09.863 --> 05:10.846
My God.

05:10.864 --> 05:12.532
My cousin Karl
crashed his car,

05:12.566 --> 05:14.350
and now he's in a coma
at the Kendall clinic.

05:14.368 --> 05:15.902
Well...

05:15.953 --> 05:17.904
Look, you don't know
what Jenna's gonna do.

05:17.955 --> 05:19.522
Yeah, I do.
It's in the book,

05:19.540 --> 05:21.291
and the book has been
right about everything.

05:21.325 --> 05:22.959
It can see the future.

05:22.993 --> 05:23.960
Well, hang on.

05:23.994 --> 05:25.078
If all of your problems
are in the book,

05:25.129 --> 05:26.629
aren't the solutions
in there too?

05:26.664 --> 05:27.997
Well, we'll see.

05:28.031 --> 05:31.417
Last year, Jenna didn't come
to her senses till I...

05:31.468 --> 05:35.388
It's all here.
This is how I break the cycle.

05:35.422 --> 05:40.476
Today, I prove the universe,
and my accountant, wrong.

05:41.845 --> 05:43.012
And, Pete,

05:43.046 --> 05:45.315
don't try to force
a nickname this year.

05:45.349 --> 05:46.683
But I just bought
a Letterman jacket

05:46.717 --> 05:49.885
with "the German"
embroidered on it.

05:49.903 --> 05:51.821
It's not refundable
if you personalize it!

05:55.025 --> 05:56.058
Jenna?

05:56.076 --> 05:57.327
I know you're gonna
freak out today.

05:57.361 --> 05:58.578
You're trying to destroy me.

05:58.612 --> 06:00.330
I refuse to be in that sketch.

06:00.364 --> 06:01.331
The <i>MacBeth</i> sketch?

06:01.365 --> 06:02.565
Shh, stop it.

06:02.583 --> 06:04.751
You never say that name
in the <i>theater.</i>

06:04.785 --> 06:05.868
It is curs-ed.

06:05.902 --> 06:06.869
Jenna, that's just
a superstition.

06:06.903 --> 06:09.038
Elizabeth, I was trained

06:09.072 --> 06:11.240
in stage acting
and game show pointing

06:11.258 --> 06:13.843
at the Royal Tampa Academy
of dramatic tricks.

06:13.877 --> 06:16.295
Where I studied
theater superstition,

06:16.347 --> 06:18.715
under Professor
Duane "Crawfish" Kenny.

06:18.749 --> 06:20.767
I'm not doing a sketch about
the Scottish play.

06:20.801 --> 06:22.251
Yeah, but this isn't
<i>MacBeth.</i>

06:22.269 --> 06:24.920
It's a timely satire
of <i>MacBeth,</i>

06:24.938 --> 06:27.023
where mayor McCheese
and his wife,

06:27.057 --> 06:29.559
an ambitious pickle,
murder king Ronald.

06:29.593 --> 06:31.778
Liz, I don't need
any more bad luck.

06:31.812 --> 06:33.229
Do you know how many
mirrors I've smashed

06:33.263 --> 06:35.281
just thinking it was
a blonde woman mocking me?

06:35.315 --> 06:38.785
Okay, fine.
Like last year I will...

06:38.819 --> 06:39.986
Just ask Cerie to do it.

06:40.037 --> 06:41.704
Sure, I'll do it.

06:41.739 --> 06:42.705
I just have to be out
in time for my band

06:42.740 --> 06:44.040
to be on <i>Letterman.</i>

06:46.443 --> 06:49.545
Perfect.
Now everyone's happy.

06:52.666 --> 06:55.251
That Jenna sure
is a handful,

06:55.285 --> 06:56.552
Hazel, damn it!

06:56.587 --> 06:57.804
I know she takes
you for granted.

06:57.838 --> 06:59.455
But I don't.

06:59.473 --> 07:02.308
Say, I bought a groupon
for a couples' massage

07:02.342 --> 07:04.811
at a resort in the Catskills
where Henny Youngman

07:04.845 --> 07:06.512
used to take his mistresses.

07:06.563 --> 07:07.563
What do you say?

07:07.598 --> 07:09.766
No. But if you want
to help me,

07:09.800 --> 07:11.150
just keep an eye on Jenna.

07:11.185 --> 07:12.635
I know she's gonna cave,

07:12.653 --> 07:14.937
I just want to make sure she
doesn't do anything crazy first.

07:14.971 --> 07:17.573
As the doctor said to me
after my hepatitis test,

07:17.608 --> 07:21.277
"you got it, sweetheart."

07:21.311 --> 07:22.862
Banks will provide...

07:22.913 --> 07:23.863
Tray.

07:23.914 --> 07:24.914
Hold up, double "L".

07:24.948 --> 07:26.332
I just want to clear this level.

07:26.366 --> 07:28.584
To navigate
the mortgage mess...

07:28.619 --> 07:29.652
Tracy, that's the news.

07:29.670 --> 07:31.504
It's the only way
we can watch it.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.424
Coming up next, how safe
is your building's elevator?

07:34.458 --> 07:36.426
Yes! A thousand points!

07:36.460 --> 07:37.927
Sure.

07:37.961 --> 07:40.713
Tracy, I know you insist
on doing your own taxes

07:40.764 --> 07:41.714
for some reason.

07:41.765 --> 07:42.998
I don't trust my accountant.

07:43.016 --> 07:45.301
I think he's lying to
me about being Jewish.

07:45.335 --> 07:47.937
I step on more wine
glasses than he does.

07:47.971 --> 07:50.723
Well, last year on this date,
you flipped out

07:50.774 --> 07:52.692
because you didn't know
it was the 14th.

07:52.726 --> 07:55.111
- So, this is an early warning...
- Wait, hold up.

07:55.145 --> 07:56.979
I didn't even know
it was April.

07:57.013 --> 07:58.180
I was gonna tell Dotcom

07:58.198 --> 08:00.733
I loved his novel
as an April fool's joke.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.952
This is all hands on deck!

08:02.986 --> 08:08.458
K-9, form of desk.

08:08.492 --> 08:10.025
Get the receipts out.

08:10.043 --> 08:11.661
This big one's
for your sneakers.

08:11.695 --> 08:14.013
Yes, do your taxes, yes.

08:20.472 --> 08:22.224
Why do you look so weird?

08:22.333 --> 08:24.668
Have I never seen you carry
a bag before?

08:24.719 --> 08:26.469
I went and took a shower
at the Racquet Club,

08:26.504 --> 08:30.473
where I saw Lou Dobbs step
on his own testicles.

08:30.508 --> 08:31.758
It was horrifying.

08:31.792 --> 08:33.809
Still trying to get
the ol' jumper cables

08:33.844 --> 08:36.429
on the tires
of your brain muffler?

08:36.462 --> 08:37.681
I don't know cars.

08:37.715 --> 08:39.649
I get ten minutes
with Hank Hooper tonight.

08:39.683 --> 08:41.267
Ten minutes to convince him

08:41.301 --> 08:43.736
to change his company forever.

08:43.770 --> 08:44.738
This is a crossroads, Lemon.

08:48.409 --> 08:49.993
You know what I miss about G.E.?

08:50.027 --> 08:51.945
The factories.
The sight of work being done,

08:51.979 --> 08:53.580
of things being made.

08:53.614 --> 08:55.532
The deafening noise
of machinery.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.450
You have
to talk like this!

08:57.484 --> 08:59.502
You can only say
what's essential!

08:59.537 --> 09:02.172
And you get to point at things!

09:02.206 --> 09:03.173
Okay, well I, for one,

09:03.207 --> 09:04.674
am crushing it today.

09:04.709 --> 09:06.843
I pre-solved my Tracy
and Jenna problems,

09:06.877 --> 09:09.012
my budget meeting with
Pete took three seconds,

09:09.046 --> 09:13.099
and I got this meditation
candle for 80% off.

09:13.134 --> 09:15.518
"Summer horse grave"?

09:15.553 --> 09:16.853
Did you say
meditation candle?

09:16.887 --> 09:18.722
Lemon, are you planning
to meditate?

09:18.773 --> 09:20.974
Yeah. I bought a meditation
stool, I have a mantra.

09:21.008 --> 09:22.108
You have a mantra?

09:22.143 --> 09:23.610
What is it?

09:23.644 --> 09:25.028
You're not supposed to tell
anybody what your mantra is.

09:25.062 --> 09:26.363
Come on.

09:26.397 --> 09:29.015
Meditation is a waste of time,
like learning French,

09:29.033 --> 09:31.985
or kissing after sex.

09:32.019 --> 09:33.486
There you are, lemonade.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.321
Distract her with your
craziness, Tracy.

09:35.355 --> 09:36.623
Otherwise she's going
to meditate.

09:36.657 --> 09:38.124
I don't have time
for that, J.D.

09:38.159 --> 09:40.877
I have to go
to Alaska immediately.

09:40.911 --> 09:41.878
Alaska, what are
you talking about?

09:41.912 --> 09:43.329
Well, Ms. Lemon,

09:43.363 --> 09:46.466
Mr. Jordan had a lot more income
this year than he anticipated,

09:46.500 --> 09:49.002
thanks to his frequent
scratch-off lotto victories,

09:49.036 --> 09:50.637
finding all that treasure
on the island

09:50.671 --> 09:51.921
he owns in the Caribbean.

09:51.972 --> 09:53.640
Quite an adventure.

09:53.674 --> 09:55.175
And designing Kate
Middleton's wedding gown.

09:55.209 --> 09:56.342
She was wonderful.

09:56.376 --> 09:59.212
Collaborative, fun,
and a little dangerous.

09:59.230 --> 10:02.348
Okay, so you have
to go to Alaska because...

10:02.382 --> 10:03.349
In order to pay my tax bill,

10:03.383 --> 10:05.101
I had to sign on
to do a movie,

10:05.152 --> 10:06.385
<i>Five dog now five.</i>

10:06.404 --> 10:08.554
- Gibberish.
- No, that's just the confusing

10:08.572 --> 10:11.557
title Disney gave
the fifth <i>Snow dogs</i> movie.

10:11.575 --> 10:13.326
The "S" s are fives.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.361
<i>Running time, 26 minutes.</i>

10:15.395 --> 10:16.946
Why do you need to do
a movie to pay your taxes?

10:16.997 --> 10:17.947
You're loaded.

10:17.998 --> 10:19.783
I'm not liquid, Liz Lemon.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.367
I'm completely solid.

10:21.401 --> 10:24.403
I took all of my money and put
it in my pool and froze it.

10:24.422 --> 10:25.955
Nope, this isn't last year.

10:26.006 --> 10:27.123
I am breaking the cycle.

10:27.174 --> 10:28.574
I will deal with this later,

10:28.592 --> 10:31.194
after I meditate.

10:31.228 --> 10:32.629
Cycle?

10:32.680 --> 10:35.932
I forgot, I sponsored the dude
that won the Tour de France.

10:35.966 --> 10:38.585
Add another zero, Ken.

10:38.619 --> 10:41.137
"Out, out,
damn spot of mustard."

10:45.109 --> 10:47.694
This is the first time
I've ever liked this show.

10:47.728 --> 10:49.863
It's so funny.

10:55.236 --> 10:56.986
There's a saying
in show business.

10:58.438 --> 11:00.156
The show must go on.

11:00.207 --> 11:02.292
And I couldn't go another
minute without being around

11:02.326 --> 11:05.662
the greatest non-pornography
crew I've ever worked with.

11:05.713 --> 11:07.797
It feels so weird
being up here.

11:07.832 --> 11:09.332
What if I get discovered?

11:09.383 --> 11:11.801
♪ Amazing... ♪

11:11.836 --> 11:16.789
♪ ...zing grace ♪

11:16.807 --> 11:19.142
I don't care if this
production is cursed.

11:19.176 --> 11:20.477
Like Lady McCheese,

11:20.511 --> 11:23.629
I will "screw my courage
to the sticking McNugget."

11:23.647 --> 11:27.734
I will do the sketch.

11:27.768 --> 11:29.269
Let me help you down, sweet.

11:29.303 --> 11:31.437
Careful, don't stab yourself.

11:31.471 --> 11:35.141
Okay, let's take it from
Grimace's family being murdered.

11:35.159 --> 11:36.809
Jenna, look out!

11:39.613 --> 11:41.080
I could have been killed.

11:41.115 --> 11:42.415
It's the curse!

11:42.449 --> 11:44.250
Sorry.

11:44.285 --> 11:46.035
Hard "K" sounds.

11:57.932 --> 12:00.216
I'm going to Alaska!
<i>Five now dog five!</i>

12:00.267 --> 12:01.500
<i>Five now dog five!</i>

12:01.519 --> 12:02.835
Everyone's trying
to destroy me.

12:02.853 --> 12:05.004
<i>Five now dog five!</i>
<i>Five now dog five!</i>

12:05.022 --> 12:06.306
Budget meeting, "the germ."

12:06.340 --> 12:08.491
Pam putch, car waiting times,
"the germ."

12:08.526 --> 12:11.227
Distractions begone!

12:11.262 --> 12:13.313
Congratulations, Elizabeth.

12:13.347 --> 12:15.398
You have achieved
transcendence,

12:15.449 --> 12:17.317
a state of pure inner peace,

12:17.351 --> 12:21.487
where all pants have
built-in underwear.

12:21.521 --> 12:24.690
You have reached
a plane of total enlightenment,

12:24.708 --> 12:26.793
and you are realizing
that Jack was right,

12:26.827 --> 12:28.661
meditation is a waste of time,

12:28.695 --> 12:29.879
time you could have spent

12:29.914 --> 12:32.799
reading that book he gave
you on business lunches,

12:32.833 --> 12:35.118
<i>Buffett on buffets.</i>

12:35.152 --> 12:36.135
But that doesn't make sense.

12:36.170 --> 12:37.503
If I've achieved enlightenment,

12:37.537 --> 12:38.805
how is this a waste of time?

12:38.839 --> 12:41.474
Let me answer your question
with a question.

12:41.508 --> 12:45.261
Why don't you just shut up
and tell me your mantra?

12:45.312 --> 12:47.347
Is it,
"time to make the donuts"?

12:47.381 --> 12:48.932
What are you doing?

12:51.518 --> 12:52.769
"Hank Hooper is coming,
Lemon.

12:52.820 --> 12:54.020
"I don't have time
for your nonsense.

12:54.054 --> 12:55.221
"I'm always criticizing
your shoes,

12:55.239 --> 12:56.773
but never offering
solutions."

12:56.824 --> 12:59.492
Don't you have a big idea you're
supposed to be coming up with?

12:59.526 --> 13:01.778
That's exactly what
I'm trying to do.

13:01.829 --> 13:03.729
I realized something today.

13:03.747 --> 13:06.783
Putting, showering,
they don't work for me.

13:06.834 --> 13:09.285
Only you can stimulate

13:09.336 --> 13:12.038
my anterior superior
temporal gyrus.

13:12.072 --> 13:14.791
Buy me a drink first.

13:14.842 --> 13:16.676
For the past six years,

13:16.710 --> 13:19.629
nothing has been a better
distraction than rescuing you

13:19.680 --> 13:23.016
from your various wrong turns
on the road of life.

13:23.050 --> 13:24.634
And I just don't know what
to do now.

13:24.685 --> 13:26.219
I'm scared, Jack.

13:26.253 --> 13:28.104
Lemon, just get another DVR
in the bedroom,

13:28.138 --> 13:30.974
and then you can record
all four shows at once.

13:31.025 --> 13:33.142
I've got it.

13:33.193 --> 13:36.262
Dump all the unsold
dishwashers into the ocean.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.982
As it turns out,
you are my shower principle,

13:39.033 --> 13:40.950
so shower me, Lemon.

13:40.985 --> 13:42.601
Shower me in the inane waters

13:42.620 --> 13:45.571
of television, food,
and feet.

13:45.605 --> 13:48.207
You know what?
Maybe you should try meditating.

13:48.242 --> 13:49.375
I am serious.

13:49.410 --> 13:51.377
The whole point
is to clear your mind.

13:51.412 --> 13:53.963
Meditate, Lemon?
I once pantsed deepak chopra

13:53.998 --> 13:55.548
while Craig T. Nelson
taped it.

13:55.582 --> 13:56.549
I don't meditate.

13:56.583 --> 13:57.717
Liz,

13:57.751 --> 13:58.801
does your journal say
anything about Frank

13:58.836 --> 14:01.454
trying to drink a gallon
of milk last year?

14:01.472 --> 14:02.455
It can't be done.

14:02.473 --> 14:03.506
God, the carpet...

14:03.557 --> 14:04.957
Somebody hold my hair back.

14:07.311 --> 14:08.928
No!

14:08.962 --> 14:10.647
My Johnny Choon.

14:10.681 --> 14:11.797
Are you all right?

14:11.815 --> 14:13.683
I've seen people
killed with shoes,

14:13.734 --> 14:15.101
but never like that.

14:15.135 --> 14:16.653
I can't believe
this is happening.

14:16.687 --> 14:18.471
I was just using the curse
of the Scottish play

14:18.489 --> 14:20.139
as an excuse to act out.

14:20.157 --> 14:21.407
But it's real.

14:21.442 --> 14:23.809
Like I need
another curse.

14:23.827 --> 14:26.479
Too busty.

14:44.798 --> 14:48.935
I'm running out of time.

14:52.106 --> 14:54.640
Meditate perfectly.

14:56.777 --> 14:58.478
Jack, tell me what
to do about my...

14:58.512 --> 15:01.680
Boyfriend! DVR! Feet!

15:01.699 --> 15:05.568
<i>SMAS</i> mondays at 10:00!
Female mustache.

15:05.619 --> 15:08.738
My casserole's burning!
My casserole's burnt!

15:08.789 --> 15:10.990
Nut up, Donaghy,
and meditate!

15:11.024 --> 15:12.291
Congratulations, Jack.

15:12.326 --> 15:13.459
You have attained...

15:13.494 --> 15:15.161
Shut up,
I don't have time for this.

15:15.195 --> 15:16.462
Give me my inspiration.

15:16.497 --> 15:18.364
My God, you're good
at meditating.

15:18.382 --> 15:20.583
The answer you seek has
been there all along.

15:20.634 --> 15:21.634
It's right behind you.

15:21.668 --> 15:22.802
Behind you.

15:22.836 --> 15:24.637
Behind you,
behind yo...

15:24.671 --> 15:26.089
I don't need an echo.

15:26.140 --> 15:27.607
I heard you.

15:27.641 --> 15:30.893
Meditation over!

15:30.928 --> 15:33.229
Behind me.

15:33.263 --> 15:35.098
Behind me.

15:35.149 --> 15:37.150
I've got it!

15:39.880 --> 15:42.380
You know what they'd thought
when I saw up your skirt.

15:42.497 --> 15:43.497
Nice.

15:43.531 --> 15:45.499
Someone won
the crotch jackpot.

15:45.533 --> 15:47.520
I need a drink.

15:48.971 --> 15:51.038
My hand!

15:51.056 --> 15:54.308
But I'm auditioning to play
senor wences' wife tomorrow!

15:56.061 --> 15:57.878
I can't take this any more.

15:57.896 --> 16:01.365
This curse is ruining
my life.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.483
No, it's not.

16:02.517 --> 16:03.484
I am.

16:03.518 --> 16:04.869
What are you talking about?

16:04.903 --> 16:08.940
The light, your shoe,
the chair, your hand.

16:08.991 --> 16:10.191
It was all me, Jenna.

16:10.225 --> 16:11.826
Wh... why would you do that?

16:11.860 --> 16:14.445
Because, I want to
be Liz Lemon's best friend.

16:14.496 --> 16:16.747
I want to know her secrets,

16:16.782 --> 16:19.667
sing Motown together
into hairbrushes,

16:19.701 --> 16:23.004
have a pair of vintage
Jordache jeans that we share.

16:23.038 --> 16:26.007
But, love has enemies...
You.

16:26.041 --> 16:28.960
- So you tried to kill me?
- Of course not, silly.

16:29.011 --> 16:31.879
I can't afford a third strike.

16:31.913 --> 16:33.347
I just wanted to scare you off.

16:33.382 --> 16:39.136
And I'll stop, if you
never speak to Liz again.

16:39.187 --> 16:40.938
Nice try, Hazel.

16:40.973 --> 16:42.306
But you made the same mistake

16:42.357 --> 16:44.358
Mickey Rourke made
on that catamaran.

16:44.393 --> 16:46.727
You didn't kill me
when you had the chance.

16:49.764 --> 16:51.098
Can I get you anything, Hank?

16:51.116 --> 16:52.984
Bottled water?

16:53.035 --> 16:54.702
I'm not fancy like that, Jack.

16:54.736 --> 16:57.204
If I get thirsty, I'll just
drink the water from lunch

16:57.239 --> 16:58.322
I saved in my cheek.

16:58.373 --> 17:01.375
I've got one word
for you, Hank...

17:01.410 --> 17:02.526
Couches.

17:02.561 --> 17:04.278
I've been thinking
about what you told

17:04.296 --> 17:05.796
the investors the other day.

17:05.830 --> 17:09.834
Kabletown fulfills our fellow
Americans' most American need...

17:09.885 --> 17:12.002
To sit on a couch,
talking on the phone,

17:12.054 --> 17:13.554
about a TV show
they're watching,

17:13.588 --> 17:15.388
based on a YouTube clip.

17:15.424 --> 17:17.558
Is NBC developing a show

17:17.592 --> 17:19.460
for that cat that jumps
in the boxes?

17:19.478 --> 17:21.561
No, that's, uh... yes!

17:21.596 --> 17:23.097
Heh!
As a matter of fact, we are.

17:23.131 --> 17:25.132
But my point is,
Kabletown controls

17:25.150 --> 17:27.184
nearly every aspect
of that experience.

17:27.234 --> 17:29.103
The phone, Internet, TV,
that's all us.

17:29.137 --> 17:32.139
But, we don't control
the couch.

17:32.157 --> 17:34.808
Why are we outsourcing
the American dream, Hank?

17:34.826 --> 17:37.845
Why are the couches our
customers sit on made in...

17:37.879 --> 17:40.481
I don't know... Vietnam?

17:42.484 --> 17:44.702
Taking my original buttocks

17:44.753 --> 17:47.505
wasn't enough
for those bastards.

17:47.539 --> 17:49.090
Here's what I want to do

17:49.124 --> 17:50.708
with our profits this quarter.

17:50.759 --> 17:52.510
I want to make couches, Hank.

17:52.544 --> 17:53.761
Kabletown couches.

17:53.795 --> 17:55.463
American couches.

17:55.497 --> 17:57.598
Boy, I do love
a good couch, Jack.

17:57.632 --> 18:00.434
You know, I'm like a couch
in a lot of ways.

18:00.469 --> 18:03.604
I fell asleep at a Raymour
and Flanigan last week,

18:03.638 --> 18:06.173
and a black family
tried to buy me.

18:06.191 --> 18:09.610
Let's do it!
Let's make us some couches.

18:09.644 --> 18:10.844
You won't
regret this, Hank.

18:10.862 --> 18:13.147
I only have three regrets
in my life, Jack.

18:13.181 --> 18:16.117
Not buying the Phillies,
not marrying my wife sooner,

18:16.151 --> 18:18.352
and not surprising you
any quicker with this hug.

18:22.491 --> 18:28.412
Yup, same as last year.

18:28.463 --> 18:31.048
My situation has progressed in
an interesting way, Liz Lemon.

18:31.083 --> 18:32.500
I don't want to hear it.

18:32.534 --> 18:34.802
To solve my tax problem, I
called the treasury department

18:34.836 --> 18:37.304
and told them I won't
pay my taxes until I see

18:37.339 --> 18:39.039
your president's
birth certificate.

18:39.057 --> 18:41.375
They told me if I did that,
they would arrest me.

18:41.393 --> 18:42.476
Things got heated,

18:42.511 --> 18:44.261
so I said I had a bomb.

18:44.312 --> 18:46.263
Hazel is trying
to destroy me.

18:46.314 --> 18:48.432
Really? Now Hazel
is trying to destroy you?

18:48.483 --> 18:51.185
Jenna, do you know how
crazy you sound right now?

18:51.219 --> 18:54.855
Liz and I, or "Lazel,"
are really worried about you.

18:54.889 --> 18:57.491
My God.
Doesn't matter what I do,

18:57.526 --> 18:59.160
- nothing ever changes.
- Ms. Lemon,

18:59.194 --> 19:01.061
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need to get

19:01.079 --> 19:02.496
a recommendation from you

19:02.531 --> 19:06.066
to reapply
to the NBC page program.

19:06.084 --> 19:07.535
We've already done
that, Kenneth.

19:07.569 --> 19:08.786
We've done all of this!

19:08.837 --> 19:11.255
All I wanted was
one shred of evidence

19:11.289 --> 19:13.073
that my life
is moving forward.

19:13.091 --> 19:14.842
Baby doll, what about me?

19:14.876 --> 19:16.410
- I'm new.
- Are you, Hazel?

19:16.428 --> 19:17.762
You're just another
weird page,

19:17.796 --> 19:19.079
and I already have
one of those.

19:19.097 --> 19:20.714
Thank you.

19:20.748 --> 19:22.416
You people,
you are the reason

19:22.434 --> 19:25.302
my life is a stagnant,
monotonous hell!

19:25.353 --> 19:27.521
No, that reminds me.

19:27.556 --> 19:30.257
My stand-up tour.
Add another zero, Ken.

19:33.278 --> 19:36.313
Jack?
Why did you invite me here?

19:36.364 --> 19:39.483
You're gonna murder me,
aren't you?

19:39.534 --> 19:41.402
- It's okay.
- Up here, Lemon.

19:41.436 --> 19:43.954
I haven't secured that
level from the rats yet.

19:49.544 --> 19:50.911
What the hell is this place?

19:50.945 --> 19:54.114
This is where
I remake Kabletown.

19:54.132 --> 19:56.417
And where Americans,
and for cost reasons,

19:56.451 --> 20:00.421
quite a few "foreign Americans,"
will make couches.

20:00.455 --> 20:02.756
To watch TV on.

20:02.790 --> 20:04.558
Do I finally understand
vertical integration?

20:04.593 --> 20:05.926
Yes.

20:05.960 --> 20:09.796
Well, at least one of us
got out of their rut today.

20:10.816 --> 20:12.900
Lemon, what are you doing?

20:12.934 --> 20:16.153
I realized today that I cannot
do my job without you.

20:16.188 --> 20:18.272
This is all because of you.

20:18.306 --> 20:20.191
You're admitting
you need me,

20:20.242 --> 20:22.142
and all my nonsense.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.911
You haven't done that since...

20:25.247 --> 20:27.064
You've never done that.

20:27.098 --> 20:29.083
I wanted a new G.E.

20:29.117 --> 20:31.919
I got a couch factory,
but it's a start.

20:31.953 --> 20:34.988
Baby steps, Lemon.

20:35.006 --> 20:36.957
- To new beginnings.
- Lemon?

20:36.991 --> 20:41.045
The cycle is broken.

20:41.096 --> 20:43.764
Jack, the rats have
my meditation stool.

20:45.517 --> 20:47.551
Help! Shoot it free!

20:47.586 --> 20:49.170
Let her go, you bastard!

20:49.856 --> 20:51.606
Tomorrow, and tomorrow,
and tomorrow,

20:52.238 --> 20:55.041
creeps in this petty
pace from day to day

20:55.075 --> 20:57.877
to the last syllable
of recorded time.

20:57.911 --> 21:00.429
And all our yesterdays
have lighted fools

21:00.464 --> 21:02.247
the way to dusty death.

21:02.265 --> 21:04.249
Out, out, brief candle.

21:04.267 --> 21:06.052
Life's but a walking shadow,

21:06.086 --> 21:09.805
a poor player that struts and
frets his hour upon the stage,

21:09.856 --> 21:11.973
and then is heard no more.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.170
It is a tail told by an idiot,

21:14.401 --> 21:17.201
full sound of furry,
signifying nothing.

21:17.538 --> 21:20.338
Would you like to try our apple dippers?
