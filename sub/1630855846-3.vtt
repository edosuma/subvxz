She saw someone break into
her house

37:35.514 --> 37:37.385
and was hiding out
at a friend's.

37:37.429 --> 37:40.127
- How is she?
- She's gonna cooperate.

37:40.170 --> 37:42.477
She wanted to come in
right after the crash.

37:42.521 --> 37:46.307
- But Owen was her boss,
and she was following orders.

37:46.351 --> 37:49.049
Obedience is strongly
motivated by authority.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.964
- And Dale was
the higher authority.

37:51.007 --> 37:53.619
He put this whole scheme
in motion.

37:53.662 --> 37:57.057
- Quis custodiet
ipsos custodes.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.320
Who's watching the watchman?

37:59.364 --> 38:02.236
- Thank you, Professor.
- [chuckles]

38:02.280 --> 38:03.759
- I'm glad I called you in
on this one.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.587
- I'm glad I was able to help.

38:11.201 --> 38:13.508
- Look, about Jace and me--

38:13.552 --> 38:14.770
- No.

38:14.814 --> 38:16.685
I'm glad you told me.
[phone ringing]

38:16.729 --> 38:19.732
But really,
it's none of my business.

38:19.775 --> 38:21.037
Excuse me.

38:21.081 --> 38:22.865
- Hmm.

38:22.909 --> 38:24.824
- Hey.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.652
You up for grabbing a bite?

38:27.305 --> 38:28.654
- I feel bad.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.525
You've got so many
more important places to be.

38:30.569 --> 38:33.267
- No, I don't.
- I mean, I shouldn't need to

38:33.311 --> 38:35.356
take up your time with
my problems.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.227
- Look, don't worry about it.

38:37.271 --> 38:39.142
Let me ask you this.

38:39.186 --> 38:41.841
Are you familiar with
the shadow self?

38:41.884 --> 38:44.757
- Of course, yeah. I did
my senior thesis on Jung, so.

38:44.800 --> 38:48.064
- Okay, so you know
that sometimes

38:48.108 --> 38:50.284
the feelings we try
the most to hide

38:50.328 --> 38:54.157
fight the hardest to get out.

38:54.201 --> 38:59.075
- I don't--
I don't want to have PTSD.

38:59.119 --> 39:00.860
- You don't.

39:00.903 --> 39:02.601
- I don't?
- No.

39:02.644 --> 39:04.472
What you're feeling
is completely normal.

39:04.516 --> 39:07.519
All you need to do is
allow yourself to feel it.

39:07.562 --> 39:08.737
- Okay.

39:08.781 --> 39:10.522
I--I thought I could just

39:10.565 --> 39:13.568
channel my energy into my work,
like--

39:13.612 --> 39:15.265
- Hmm, like me?
- Yeah.

39:15.309 --> 39:17.398
- [laughs]
- Yes.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.748
- That wasn't
my initial reaction.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.010
I didn't have this work
for years.

39:21.054 --> 39:22.098
- Right.

39:22.142 --> 39:24.927
- First, I needed to learn to

39:24.971 --> 39:28.409
remember the explosion
without reliving it.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.019
- How'd you do that?

39:30.063 --> 39:31.630
- Reframing.

39:31.673 --> 39:36.199
I needed to see my experience
as a chance to

39:36.243 --> 39:39.420
better understand
the decisions people make

39:39.464 --> 39:42.467
and how we can all
make better ones.

39:42.510 --> 39:44.120
- Hmm.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.687
- Try it where you sit.

39:45.731 --> 39:47.080
- Okay.

39:47.123 --> 39:49.604
Uh, I guess this led to
a chance

39:49.648 --> 39:52.955
for me to help expose
an NTSB coverup.

39:52.999 --> 39:54.435
- There you go.

39:54.479 --> 39:59.440
This work can be
surprising, stimulating,

39:59.484 --> 40:02.443
profoundly fulfilling, right?

40:02.487 --> 40:06.447
But...all-consuming.
- Mm.

40:06.491 --> 40:10.712
- So if you bury yourself
in it,

40:10.756 --> 40:13.715
there's a cost.

40:13.759 --> 40:16.762
- [sighs]

40:16.805 --> 40:18.807
- Breaking news out of
Washington, DC.

40:18.851 --> 40:20.461
Six senior executives have
been arrested

40:20.505 --> 40:21.897
at Hollette Aviation.

40:21.941 --> 40:24.509
Evidence shows that
a bug in a firmware update

40:24.552 --> 40:26.772
caused the guidance system
to malfunction.

40:26.815 --> 40:29.427
The pilot, Lucas Taylor,
attempted to override

40:29.470 --> 40:31.037
the automated controls.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.431
Simulations have shown that
had the aircraft responded

40:33.474 --> 40:35.171
to actions in the cockpit,

40:35.215 --> 40:38.174
he would have safely
emergency landed the plane.

40:38.218 --> 40:40.089
Still,
in the face of disaster,

40:40.133 --> 40:41.482
his extraordinary bravery

40:41.526 --> 40:43.484
saved more than half
of the passengers.

40:43.528 --> 40:45.181
Tonight's vigil is a tribute

40:45.225 --> 40:48.663
to the courage of all those
aboard Flight 118.
