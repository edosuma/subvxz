WEBVTT

00:01.401 --> 00:03.203
(phone ringing)

00:05.506 --> 00:07.040
Roxie: Ah, nuh-uh.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.343
Kev, you can't
strain your eyes.
Your brain might explode.

00:09.343 --> 00:13.180
Guys, it's really nice of you
to be taking such good care
of me, okay,

00:13.180 --> 00:15.215
-but I need to
check my emails. I--
-Don't.

00:15.215 --> 00:18.185
I'm expecting one from the
Italian company I'm supposed
to interview with.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.987
-I'll check.
-Okay.

00:19.987 --> 00:22.289
Roxie: Okay, let's see.
You have a news alert,

00:22.289 --> 00:24.191
-a book signing invite...
-Oh.

00:24.191 --> 00:28.595
and four emails from Mom.
Kev, you have got to
set your filters better.

00:28.595 --> 00:30.230
-Oh, Gourmet Couture?
-That's them.

00:30.230 --> 00:32.232
They want to interview you
here in LA this week.

00:32.232 --> 00:35.102
I don't know if I can
pull it together this week,
I mean...

00:35.102 --> 00:37.104
maybe that's a sign
I shouldn't do it.
I don't know.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.172
Kevin, don't worry about it
right now.

00:39.172 --> 00:41.141
Yeah, you know what?
You just worry about
getting better.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.509
-Yeah.
-Okay.

00:42.509 --> 00:45.445
Ugh, I can't take it.
He's so needy.

00:45.445 --> 00:48.515
Well, to be fair, he did
get knocked unconscious
by a 50-pound sign.

00:49.516 --> 00:52.252
But, I mean, I got kicked
in the head once by a wild pig.

00:52.252 --> 00:53.520
I didn't even feel it.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.356
The EMT said it's because
my body went into shock.

00:57.491 --> 01:00.160
You gotta be a real man
to completely shut down
like that.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.229
God. You know,
the worst part is,

01:02.229 --> 01:05.299
I don't even have time to
prepare for this audition,
and I really want the part.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.534
It's a TV movie remake
of <i>Casablanca.</i>

01:07.534 --> 01:09.102
You know, that old
black and white movie.

01:09.102 --> 01:11.104
Oh yeah, by that
Woody Allen guy?

01:11.104 --> 01:13.173
Yeah, probably.
Anyway, it's gonna be awesome.

01:13.173 --> 01:16.276
So, in the original,
the lead is just this
random dude in a hat,

01:16.276 --> 01:19.112
but in this one,
it's a hot woman lifeguard.

01:19.112 --> 01:20.514
Totally feminist.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.484
Oh, you gotta get
that part in a swimsuit.

01:24.484 --> 01:26.753
Like-- Like, you know,
for the women of the world.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.456
Yeah, I know. I'm trying,
but when am I gonna
find time to rehearse?

01:29.456 --> 01:32.159
I mean, I spend my days
brushing Kevin's teeth,

01:32.159 --> 01:33.760
and then sticking straws
in his apple sauce.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.396
Look, we gotta do this, okay?
It's our duty.

01:37.497 --> 01:40.467
Kevin: Hey, guys!
I'm thirsty.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.303
Here's your breakfast, bud.
Okay? And here's your
anti-convulsant.

01:43.303 --> 01:45.305
Do you want me to crush it up
and put it in your food?

01:45.305 --> 01:47.274
No, I can still chew.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.709
No, he doesn't need
the meds yet, anyway.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.143
Yes, he does.
It's been two hours.

01:50.143 --> 01:52.279
He's supposed to take it
every four hours.
Read the bottle.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.114
I did.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.049
Okay, I'm sorry, I thought
you were on electronics,
and I was on the meds.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.118
No, no. I'm on meds.
When have I not been on meds?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.219
Kevin: Very rarely.

01:59.219 --> 02:04.458
Guys, please stop arguing,
okay? You can both
give me meds.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.262
I thi--
I think we both did, Kev.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.131
-(snoring)
-Brian: Yeah, okay.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.001
Forget duty. If he
survives this, we definitely
need to get some help.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.502
-Kevin?
-Kev?

02:15.502 --> 02:17.604
-Kev. Kevion. Kev-Kev.
-Kev. Kev?

02:17.604 --> 02:20.140
-(theme music playing)
<i>-♪ Because it's all good ♪</i>

02:20.140 --> 02:22.676
<i>♪ It's all, all,</i>
<i>It's all good ♪</i>

02:22.676 --> 02:25.012

<i>It's all good ♪</i>

02:25.012 --> 02:28.115

02:28.115 --> 02:30.050

<i>♪ Uh-huh, yep,</i>
<i>It's all good ♪</i>

02:36.189 --> 02:38.425
So, I looked into it,

02:38.425 --> 02:40.560
and Kevin's insurance covers
a nurse's aide.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.095
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.397
That's awesome, Brian.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.432
So, you know, get on in there
and practice for your audition.

02:45.432 --> 02:46.667
I'll let you know
when she gets here.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.169
Aw, thank you.
You're the best!
(laughs)

02:49.169 --> 02:51.071
-Aw.
-Okay.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.173
Thank you.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.012
Did you see my linen scarf?
I'm late for work.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.415
It's in the sleeve
of my black moto jacket.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.383
-Did you borrow it?
-Yeah.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.452
I didn't ask you 'cause
I thought that would make
things weird.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.989
(sighs loudly)

03:08.989 --> 03:11.324
It must be nice
to have a place to go,

03:11.324 --> 03:13.493
a job where people
look up to you,

03:13.493 --> 03:15.429
even though
you look down on them.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.065
What are--
What are you talking about?

03:18.065 --> 03:19.733
Dev's in Miami
at a DJ convention.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.368
I'm feeling lonely.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.671
I've already had four mimosas,
one without orange juice.

03:24.671 --> 03:27.307
Okay, you need to get out.

03:27.307 --> 03:30.510
You know, Brock and I are going
to trivia night tonight
at the bar. Do you want to come?

03:30.510 --> 03:32.212
-With you guys?
-Yeah.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.214
No, I'd just feel like
a third wheel.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.049
Okay, if you
change your mind...

03:36.049 --> 03:38.685
Okay, fine. Stop harping.
I'll go.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.287
Okay.

03:40.287 --> 03:43.590
It's insane to remake
a classic like <i>Casablanca.</i>

03:43.590 --> 03:45.225
Can you read me
something else?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.327
Something that'll help me
prepare for my interview?

03:47.327 --> 03:50.130
Oh, uh, you emailed back
Gourmet Couture, right?

03:50.130 --> 03:52.165
Yes, but it's
the day after tomorrow,

03:52.165 --> 03:53.633
so you won't be able to go,
unless you relax.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.536
Okay, ready?
So the update is genius.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.538
It takes place
at a beach club.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.273
Oh, really?

04:00.273 --> 04:02.743
Yeah, and they replace
the Nazis with the staff
of a competing spa.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.411
I don't want to ruin it.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.079
At least no more
than that.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.249
"We'll always have Paris.
That hotel in Vegas
where we met."

04:09.249 --> 04:10.984
Oh my God.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.220
"I was 19.
You were 20.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.489
But a young 20."

04:17.324 --> 04:19.359
The spa technicians
are better in Paris.

04:19.359 --> 04:21.228
I should be leaving for Italy.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.531
But say the word,
and I'll stay.

04:24.531 --> 04:25.732
(whistle trills)

04:25.732 --> 04:27.601
Don't go in the water.
She's trouble.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.436
No, you're wrong.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.138
She's sweet and funny.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.739
And have you seen
the way she watches football

04:32.739 --> 04:35.375
and actually knows
what's going on just enough,

04:35.375 --> 04:36.743
but not so much
as to be annoying like,

04:36.743 --> 04:38.411
"Hey, look at me.
I'm a guy's girl."

04:38.411 --> 04:40.247
I appreciate that.

04:41.681 --> 04:43.216
I'm the one
she should be with.

04:43.216 --> 04:46.987
But she doesn't
appreciate you back.
When are you gonna see that?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.090
Damn, I look hot in this.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.626
(whistle trilling)

04:52.626 --> 04:54.461
(doorbell rings)

04:54.461 --> 04:57.230
Hello, I'm Beverly.
The agency sent me.

04:57.230 --> 05:00.634
Okay, how big is he?
My last patient was
a 600-pounder.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.436
I spent all my time
mopping up tears of regret

05:03.436 --> 05:06.039
that I swear were
pure bacon fat.
(laughs)

05:07.240 --> 05:08.241
'Cause the fat.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.479
Oh, she needs
to get off the bed.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.981
You can sleep with her
all you want once you're
up to snuff.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.417
Brian: No, no, no.
No, he's not sleeping with her.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.419
She's not sleeping
with anybody.
She's available.

05:19.419 --> 05:22.389
Well, she needs
to dismount the bed,
because it's dangerous,

05:22.389 --> 05:26.426
and we need to pad the corners
of these night stands.
They're dangerous.

05:26.426 --> 05:29.062
Now, I'm gonna be
in the bathroom to see
if I can find anything--

05:29.062 --> 05:30.597
-Dangerous?
-...to read.

05:30.597 --> 05:33.200
-I'll see you in ten.
-Eh.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.502
Does the agency have
any other--

05:35.502 --> 05:37.337
Calling while she's
on the can, believe me.

05:45.445 --> 05:49.449
Did someone call Jimmy Jammy,
the funny duddy buddy?
Hoo hoo hoo!

05:49.449 --> 05:51.284
(laughs)

05:54.421 --> 05:56.590
I am Ramone, the healer
you are blessed with today.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.758
-Oh, you're hired.
-Wrong house.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.697
Hey, whoa, uh...

06:05.298 --> 06:06.733
Wh-- What's going on?

06:06.733 --> 06:08.969
Oh, we must keep
the lighting dim to
aid in Kevin's recovery.

06:08.969 --> 06:12.272
You should totally have
Ramone make you lunch.
It is incredible.

06:12.272 --> 06:13.440
When I opened
the refrigerator,

06:13.440 --> 06:15.242
I noticed a
selection of luncheon meats,

06:15.242 --> 06:17.611
so I paired it with
a loaf of soft wheat bread

06:17.611 --> 06:20.313
and a grainy mustard,
with a hint of spice.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.715
That sounds like
an awful fancy way to say

06:21.715 --> 06:23.550
you made a ham sandwich.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.252
Isn't he supposed
to, like, change bed sheets
and sterilize stuff?

06:25.252 --> 06:27.387
Oh, he already did all that.
Ramone is amazing,

06:27.387 --> 06:29.422
and when he talks,
it sounds like music.

06:29.422 --> 06:30.991
No, it doesn't.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.427
-Okay.
-We're all signing this
for Kevin.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.566
Brain bruising
is for the birds.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.401
It's from a set of 400 cards,

06:41.401 --> 06:43.436
one for every
injury and disease
you've ever heard of.

06:43.436 --> 06:47.340
There's one for non-Addison's
adrenal malfunction
that's a crack-up,

06:47.340 --> 06:48.408
if you know anyone.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.411
(sigh) I can't think of
what to say.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.214
This is Patti's fault.
She made me second-guess
myself last night.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.415
Okay, next question.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.651
Write down as many
Tom Cruise movies as you can.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.519
We're running out of time.
<i>Mission Impossible.</i>

06:59.519 --> 07:00.453
<i>-A Few Good Men.</i>
<i>-Magnolia.</i>

07:00.453 --> 07:02.055
<i>-Minority Report.</i>
<i>-Night and Day.</i>

07:02.055 --> 07:04.491
<i>-Far and Away.</i>
-Where he rode on
that horse to that land.

07:04.491 --> 07:06.092
<i>-Far and Away!</i>
-We have that one.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.294
<i>-Tropic Thunder!</i>
<i>-Tropic Thunder!</i>

07:07.294 --> 07:08.662
-Brock!
-I said that!

07:08.662 --> 07:10.397
Four hours too late.
You're killing us.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.332
She does have
a strong personality.

07:12.332 --> 07:13.466
Yeah, she's bossy.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.235
It's like a queen bee.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.503
It's not a good thing.

07:16.503 --> 07:17.704
She made me feel like
a third wheel

07:17.704 --> 07:19.639
in my own relationship.
Who does that?

07:19.639 --> 07:21.408
-Did you win?
-Yes.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.576
Two tickets to
one of those escape room games,

07:23.576 --> 07:24.544
which I'm taking
for myself

07:24.544 --> 07:26.246
because I paid
the entrance fee.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.481
(gasps) Well, if you
think it'll help,

07:28.481 --> 07:31.151
I would go out with Patti
while Dev's gone.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.419
I mean, occupy her
for a while.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.988
Really?
That would be great.
Thank you.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.457
Consider it done.
(laughs) I can't wait.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.759
Unlike you, I like when
Patti takes control.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.528
I feel a deep letting go,

07:41.528 --> 07:44.464
a freedom
of responsibility.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.433
I hope I don't accidentally
thrill kill someone.

07:50.537 --> 07:53.573
Don't you think you should
save some of that for Kevin?

07:53.573 --> 07:55.275
Oh, he already did Kevin.
Ramone's amazing,

07:55.275 --> 07:58.144
and he has single-handedly
made Kevin feel so much better.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.679
No, he's not.
He's not that great.

07:59.679 --> 08:02.182
Please excuse me while
I make Kevin a ham
and cheese sandwich.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.584
Oh, uh, no.
He doesn't like cheese on it.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.619
Trust me. I've been making
the kid's sandwiches for years.

08:06.619 --> 08:08.421
Kevin said he'd like
to try my sandwich

08:08.421 --> 08:09.723
as I prepare it,
<i>con queso.</i>

08:09.723 --> 08:11.491
I don't know what you
just said right there,

08:11.491 --> 08:12.659
so I'm gonna take offense.
That's it!

08:14.227 --> 08:15.695
Roxie: Brian, wait.
What are you doing?

08:15.695 --> 08:17.197
Hey.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.366
No, no, no. Ramone said that
it has to be dark in here.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.567
Look, Ramone
doesn't know anything.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.703
He's a phony,
and that accent
isn't real.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.271
Nobody really talks
like that,

08:25.271 --> 08:27.674
except for Antonio Banderas
and the cat from <i>Shrek.</i>

08:27.674 --> 08:29.342
Roxie:
He is not a phony,

08:29.342 --> 08:31.711
and he is doing
everything around here.
Okay? Kevin needs him.

08:31.711 --> 08:34.247
Kevin's fine with me
and my cheeseless sandwiches.

08:34.247 --> 08:37.384
It's okay, Roxanne.
I'll just tell the agency
I was too helpful.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.452
This information
will correspond with
all my Yelp reviews.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.221
I'll be fine.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.491
Don't you look at me
like that.

08:46.393 --> 08:47.627
What are you doing?

08:47.627 --> 08:49.229
We can't lose Ramone.
We need him.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.531
I don't trust
Ramone, okay?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.433
He's getting a little
too comfortable around here.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.301
I'm going to bring him
back here,

08:55.301 --> 08:57.437
and you're going
to apologize to him.

08:57.437 --> 09:00.006
Ugh, crap. I don't even
have time to put on a bra.
Oh well.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.207
No, you should do that.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.642
It's-- It's chilly outside.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.010
Ramone, wait!

09:05.011 --> 09:06.112
(sighs)

09:07.180 --> 09:08.448
Hey.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.988
Where's the picture of my family
at my cousin's wedding?

09:16.322 --> 09:18.425
Oh, yeah.
It creeped me out,

09:18.425 --> 09:20.026
so I took it down.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.629
I could feel their eyes
following me around the room,

09:22.629 --> 09:24.664
especially that gremlin
in the pearls.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.599
My-- My grandmother?

09:26.599 --> 09:28.234
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.570
Fingers crossed
for weak genetics.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.505
Anyhow, so Dev's still
out of town.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.507
What are you, me
and Brock doing tonight?

09:34.507 --> 09:36.576
Oh, um...

09:36.576 --> 09:39.145
Brock has practice,
and I have to work late, so.
(chuckles)

09:39.145 --> 09:42.248
-But you're home.
-But I'm going back.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.750
Why don't you see
if Ricky is free?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.385
Hmm...

09:45.385 --> 09:47.620
Well, he did call, text,
and email me,

09:47.620 --> 09:48.655
and he's fun.

09:48.655 --> 09:51.491
-Yeah.
-He does this thing
where he almost pets me.

09:51.491 --> 09:54.627
Maybe I'll go out with him
to determine whether
it's sweet or...

09:54.627 --> 09:55.762
disturbing.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.464
Yes, do that.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.065
I think that sounds
really awesome.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.501
Hey.

10:01.501 --> 10:04.537
The Italy company's
confirming your interview.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.507
Man, if you get that job
and move, it sure is
gonna kill me.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.644
You know what else
is killing me?

10:11.644 --> 10:13.179
Ramone.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.515
I kicked him out
and fought with Roxie
about it.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.452
But she was right.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.055
I was jealous.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.089
I mean,

10:23.089 --> 10:26.326
she thinks he's great,
you think he's great,

10:26.326 --> 10:28.261
and I don't like
the competition.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.764
I know you can relate.

10:34.567 --> 10:37.637
You wanna hear
a song, Kev?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.506
Can you play
the piano, Brian?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.242
I can't.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.410
I'm more of a violin man.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.479
Can you play the violin?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.348
(chuckles)

10:48.348 --> 10:49.716
I can't.

11:06.232 --> 11:07.700
Kevin: Brock.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.602
Oh, sorry.

11:09.602 --> 11:12.071
I was supposed to stick
this on my side.

11:18.978 --> 11:22.682
Of all the
food and beverage joints in
all the towns in all the world,

11:22.682 --> 11:24.651
she walks into mine.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.553
She's the reason
you're upset, Kevin.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.589
Just go to Italy, buddy.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.292
But he's wrong for her.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.127
I know she has to see
that, eventually.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.161
So, what are you gonna do?

11:35.161 --> 11:37.463
Stay here and keep
getting your heart broken

11:37.463 --> 11:39.098
over and over again
until she does?

11:40.767 --> 11:43.536
Ramone:
You cannot compete with a man
who's already defeated you.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.610
Brian: Now Roxie's
going after Ramone,

11:50.610 --> 11:52.245
braless.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.751
(sighs) Okay, I gotta
come clean to you, man. I'm--

12:00.620 --> 12:02.455
I'm jealous of Ramone
because of your sister.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.457
I got it bad for her, Kevin.
I mean, like, real bad.

12:04.457 --> 12:08.194
Like...
(hums) real bad.

12:11.030 --> 12:14.667
Okay, well, I feel a lot better
that I got that off my chest,

12:14.667 --> 12:17.136
even though
you can't hear me.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.274
You're breaking my heart.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.448
You're breaking my heart.

12:29.682 --> 12:30.750
Huh?

12:38.358 --> 12:41.594
I'm really happy we're doing
this escape room, babe,
just you and me.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.764
I'm pumped, babe.
I'm so good at mazes.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.000
Woman:
It's not a maze.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.735
It's a game where
you have 45 minutes

12:48.735 --> 12:51.037
to find clues
to help you escape,
or they kill you.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.672
Man:
I mean, you lose the game.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.008
Obviously, they
don't actually kill you.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.610
(laughs sarcastically)
Obviously, because I'd break
their freaking necks first.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.315
I'm gonna be
so good at this.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.751
I used to stage my own
kidnappings all the time
when I was a kid.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.453
Oh, why are you here?
I thought you were working.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.323
-No, she never had to work.
-Um...

13:10.323 --> 13:11.457
Did you, babe?

13:11.457 --> 13:13.426
I'm goi-- I'm going there
after-- after this.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.028
You lied to me?

13:15.028 --> 13:16.396
Audrey, I can't believe you.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.730
Okay, Patti,

13:17.730 --> 13:20.733
I'm sorry. I just
really wanted this night

13:20.733 --> 13:23.002
for myself without you
controlling the whole thing.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.570
And thanks a lot, Ricky.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.372
Why did you come here
of all places?

13:26.372 --> 13:30.009
She said, "Take me to that place
I won tickets to last night
that Audrey snaked,"

13:30.009 --> 13:31.744
and you don't challenge
a queen bee.

13:32.979 --> 13:36.015
I hope a basic knowledge
of film trivia
isn't a requirement,

13:36.015 --> 13:38.584
-or else we're
never getting out of here.
-(chuckles)

13:38.584 --> 13:41.287
Yeah, well I hope
respect for other people's
personal property

13:41.287 --> 13:42.522
isn't a requirement either

13:42.522 --> 13:44.290
or we're really, really
never getting out of here.

13:44.290 --> 13:48.161
Unless you've dramatically
improved your game skills
since last night,

13:48.161 --> 13:52.398
you and Brock should prepare
to have your asses kicked
by me and Ricky.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.734
Oh, uh... (chuckles)

13:54.734 --> 13:57.036
Are those for sure
the teams?

13:57.036 --> 13:59.739
Actually, we're all
on the same team,
working together.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.240
Huh.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.476
Together.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.445
-Announcer:
<i>Say goodbye.</i>
-Ricky: What's happening?

14:05.445 --> 14:08.448
Announcer:
<i>You are about to enter</i>
<i>Murder Basement.</i>

14:08.448 --> 14:11.050
-(laughs maniacally)
-Ricky: Patti?
Patti, are you there?

14:11.050 --> 14:13.586
I already don't like this.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.255
I'm sorry, Ramone.

14:16.255 --> 14:17.490
I overreacted.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.727
You are a man
of passion.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.362
-Yeah.
-As am I.

14:23.429 --> 14:25.031
And so we reach
a resolution.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.300
-Yeah.
-Please, sit.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.035
Ah, okay.

14:31.237 --> 14:33.106
Did you-- Oh, no, no.
You don't have to--

14:33.106 --> 14:35.074
Oh, okay.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.976
Okay, yeah, no.

14:36.976 --> 14:38.478
This is why
everybody likes this.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.346
I understand
you are upset,

14:40.346 --> 14:42.148
because I saw
into your heart.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.483
You are
in love with Roxanne.

14:45.084 --> 14:46.085
Maybe.

14:47.453 --> 14:50.089
I hope you did not mistake
my care-taking for flirtation.

14:50.089 --> 14:52.592
(scoffs) You kiddin' me?
No way.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.293
Okay, yeah.
Maybe I did a little bit.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.262
Make no mistake.

14:56.262 --> 14:58.564
I am here to breath life
into Kevin's weak body,

14:58.564 --> 15:01.300
not seduce his sister's.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.070
Now, does Roxanne know
you have these desires
for her?

15:04.070 --> 15:06.239
Well, she doesn't,
but I think he does.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.040
So I was thinking
I should tell her.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.108
I mean, what do I have
to lose, right?

15:09.108 --> 15:10.977
Everything.

15:10.977 --> 15:13.045
Where I come from, we say,
"You don't date your
best friend's sister.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.281
"You marry your
best friend's sister,

15:15.281 --> 15:16.983
or risk losing
your best friend."

15:18.384 --> 15:20.052
You're right.

15:20.052 --> 15:22.722
I can't date Roxie unless
I'm sure it'll work.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.124
These clues are useless.

15:25.124 --> 15:27.660
There's got to be
something major
we're not seeing.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.163
I'm checking this.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.031
Ah, you don't know
what to look for.
Give it to me.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.132
I do know
what to look for, Patti.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.467
Ricky: Guys,

15:34.467 --> 15:35.668
we're gonna be dead
in 22 minutes.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.371
There's so much
I have left to do
before I die.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.706
-Doll: <i>Mama.</i>
-I never thanked
my high school drama teacher

15:40.706 --> 15:42.108
for making me feel
so accepted.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.110
I never apologized
to my cousin, Greg

15:44.110 --> 15:45.611
for being jealous
of his mustache.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.214
I never got in touch
with my Jewish heritage.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.483
Okay, okay.
Listen up, people.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.019
As your captain,
I command you to
rip up the couch.

15:53.019 --> 15:54.654
The couch has nothing to do
with the puzzle,

15:54.654 --> 15:57.590
and you're not the captain
just because you say you are.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.025
Uh, babe.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.162
That's how I became
captain of the jujitsu team,
so it can happen.

16:03.162 --> 16:06.265
I hear the dogs!
They're getting closer!

16:06.265 --> 16:08.067
They're not real dogs.

16:08.067 --> 16:11.103
Then why am I having
an allergic reaction?

16:11.103 --> 16:12.438
And this room,

16:12.438 --> 16:14.707
getting smaller.
It's getting smaller.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.375
Okay, calm down, Ricky!
Calm down!

16:16.375 --> 16:18.711
We're not gonna die here.
I won't let it happen.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.481
He will if you keep
sucking the air
out of the room.

16:21.481 --> 16:25.084
Oh, am I sucking in
all your air, Audrey?

16:25.084 --> 16:27.353
Was I supposed to ask
to borrow it first?

16:27.353 --> 16:28.688
Others have been here.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.256
Others have died!

16:30.256 --> 16:31.424
Patti!

16:31.424 --> 16:33.759
It's okay.
We have a safe word.

16:33.759 --> 16:36.395
Butter, but that wasn't me
using it just then.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.531
Doll: <i>Ow.</i>

16:38.531 --> 16:40.066
Brian: Hey.

16:40.066 --> 16:43.035
So, the doc said he's
well enough to handle
the meeting,

16:43.035 --> 16:44.637
but not heavy machinery.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.173
So, I'll drive and work
the elevators for him.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.575
Thanks, Brian. Kevin needs
you too, you know?

16:49.575 --> 16:52.278
Yeah, I know. I finally
got to see what you guys
see in Ramone.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.380
He's a good guy
and wise.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.616
His chiseled face
and piercing eyes
are just a bonus.

16:58.084 --> 16:59.585
Yeah, a guy like that
is one in a million.

16:59.585 --> 17:00.753
Huh.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.056
You know, I always thought
he was just another pretty boy

17:04.056 --> 17:07.326
who's good at giving massages,
but he's more than that.
You're right.

17:07.326 --> 17:08.394
I'm right?

17:09.729 --> 17:11.197
What are you doing?

17:11.197 --> 17:12.732
Emailing him to see
if he wants to hook up.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.101
But he said I shouldn't
mistake his care-taking
for flirtation.

17:15.101 --> 17:17.470
Oh, thanks for the tip, Bri.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.671
Yeah.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.040
Looks like I'm gonna have to
be the aggressor on this one.

17:22.241 --> 17:23.175
(whimpers)

17:30.550 --> 17:32.218
Brock and I
are going to Paris,

17:32.218 --> 17:33.686
and you can come, right?

17:33.686 --> 17:35.154
Won't that be wonderful?

17:35.154 --> 17:37.156
The three of us forever.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.258
I'm sorry,
but I can't do that anymore.

17:39.258 --> 17:41.427
I'm the only one
getting on that plane.

17:41.427 --> 17:44.196
I'm going to Italy...

17:44.196 --> 17:45.197
alone.

17:45.197 --> 17:48.534
No, I'm coming
with you, Kev.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.170
What's up?

17:56.108 --> 17:57.677
You know, Brian,

17:57.677 --> 18:00.379
I think this is
the continuation
of a beautiful friendship.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.620
(whistle trills)

18:07.620 --> 18:10.089
Round up the
usual spa guests.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.124
It's gonna be
a rager tonight.

18:16.128 --> 18:18.397
Patti:
Check the beds. Check the lamps.
Check the thermostat.

18:18.397 --> 18:21.200
It's freaking humid
in here. Is my hair fuzzy?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.702
Forget it.
We're out of clues,

18:22.702 --> 18:24.737
and you as our
self-appointed leader
did nothing to save us.

18:24.737 --> 18:27.974
Maybe if you let this be
something other than
<i>The Patti Show,</i>

18:27.974 --> 18:29.275
we could escape.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.209
Uh, my show?

18:30.209 --> 18:32.445
You're the one who thinks
you own this thing.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.547
You didn't even want me
to be here.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.682
I didn't want you to come
because I thought you would do
exactly what you're doing.

18:36.682 --> 18:38.584
What you always do--
take over.

18:38.584 --> 18:41.287
I don't want
to take over, okay?

18:41.287 --> 18:44.390
I guess I've just
never really known
how to take a back seat.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.158
Look, maybe it's
to feel needed,

18:46.158 --> 18:48.694
or 'cause I'm an only child
and always had to
fend for myself.

18:48.694 --> 18:51.230
Maybe it's 'cause
when my parents divorced,

18:51.230 --> 18:53.766
I grasped at control
'cause I had none.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.501
Or maybe I'm just entitled.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.169
I think it's
the last one.

18:57.169 --> 19:01.374
Look, whatever the reason is,
it's not an excuse
to do what you want,

19:01.374 --> 19:04.343
not all the time, like
borrow stuff without asking

19:04.343 --> 19:06.479
or taking people's
family photos down

19:06.479 --> 19:08.047
because their grandmothers
creep you out.

19:09.215 --> 19:11.150
Oh, the pictures!

19:11.150 --> 19:12.284
Check behind the pictures!

19:12.284 --> 19:14.120
Go! That one.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.222
-Something,
something, something.
-Keep checking! Faster!

19:16.222 --> 19:17.456
Go, go, go.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.325
Oh! Hey, babe, there's numbers
behind this one!

19:19.325 --> 19:20.326
Yes! Read them to me!

19:20.326 --> 19:21.694
-Two-
-Too slow!

19:21.694 --> 19:23.529
Two, seven, six, nine.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.031
-Wooh!
-Announcer:
<i>Congratulations,</i>

19:25.031 --> 19:27.633
<i>-you have escaped</i>
<i>Murder Basement.</i>
-(cheers)

19:27.633 --> 19:29.735
You guys were useless.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.737
We never would have looked
behind the pictures

19:31.737 --> 19:33.339
if you hadn't
pointed them out.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.241
I'm sorry I almost
didn't give you a chance.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.610
And I need to learn
to speak up right away.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.479
Sometimes I wish
I had a little of your...

19:40.479 --> 19:42.081
assertiveness.

19:42.081 --> 19:43.749
It actually came in
handy tonight.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.253
-Ricky: Move.
-Audrey: Oh.

19:47.253 --> 19:48.220
Okay, okay.

19:48.220 --> 19:51.057
Oh, after you.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.491
Thank you.

19:52.491 --> 19:55.461
Okay, this is what
a back seat feels like.
Not so bad.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.630
Go get me
my purse, hon.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.400
Purse, purse, purse.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.602
-Announcer:
<i>Welcome to Murder Basement.</i>
-No, no, no.

20:03.602 --> 20:05.971
<i>-Escape and win.</i>
-No, no.
There's been a mistake!

20:05.971 --> 20:08.307
<i>-Fail and die!</i>
-Murder! Murder!

20:08.307 --> 20:10.242
Murder!

20:12.978 --> 20:14.346
Hey, how'd it go?

20:14.346 --> 20:15.247
-Good, man.
-Yeah?

20:15.247 --> 20:17.216
Great. I got the job.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.118
Well, I guess
I'm moving to Italy.

20:19.118 --> 20:20.686
-You serious?
-Yeah.

20:20.686 --> 20:22.988
Hey, you should
come with me, man.

20:22.988 --> 20:26.292
Something in a dream made me
think that would be a
really good move for you.

20:26.292 --> 20:29.428
Oh, this works, man,
because I have no reason
to stay here. Yes.

20:29.428 --> 20:31.130
-Yeah?
-Yes, let's go to Italy, boy.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.431
-Oh! (laughs)
-Let's go. Let's go.

20:32.431 --> 20:35.067
Wait, you're not gonna
miss Roxie? I thought you would.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.169
Psh, no, I've-- that's--

20:37.169 --> 20:38.738
that's crazy stuff,
Kev. No.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.172
You know what's
even crazier?

20:40.172 --> 20:42.041
I always kinda saw
you two together, eventually.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.509
Huh?

20:43.509 --> 20:45.010
You don't--

20:45.010 --> 20:47.046
You don't think that that would
ruin our friendship?

20:47.046 --> 20:48.280
No.

20:51.383 --> 20:52.551
You think she'll visit?

20:52.551 --> 20:53.753
(chuckles) No.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.655
She would not like it there.
She can't stand accents.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.691
Damn, she might be
over that now.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.296
Hey, man, thanks for
taking care of me this week.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.031
Finally back to normal.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.433
Yeah, about time.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.235
Well, wish me luck
on this interview.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.704
Kev, you already did
the interview, Kevin.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.506
-Hmm?
-Oh, shoot.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.341
-Hey, come back, buddy.
No, Kev.
-Huh?

21:15.341 --> 21:17.376
Kev, you already did it.
You already did the--

21:17.376 --> 21:19.078
-You already did the--
-Yeah, right. I already did it.
Okay.
