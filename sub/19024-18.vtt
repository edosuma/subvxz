00:01.280 --> 00:03.794
Maybe it's because
spring is around the corner,

00:03.880 --> 00:06.474
but lately it feels
like romance is in the air.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.755
- How's that?
- You close your eyes too early.

00:10.840 --> 00:13.035
And you always go in right.
Try going left.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.429
- The girls'll dig that.
- OK. Fo'shizzle.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.353
What's up, girl?

00:18.440 --> 00:20.908
Nothing that dog did in life
could deserve that.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.755
What you talking about? My man's single,
he's running drills to keep sharp.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.752
It would be great if you never
mention this to anyone, ever.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.994
Are you crazy? You know she'll say
something. We're talking about Carla.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.878
- So now I'm a gossip?
- Yeah, you gossip all the time.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.076
- Since when?
- Since ever. To everybody.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.278
It's weird, ever since they got engaged,
Turk and Carla have argued constantly.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.189
You want some kibble?

00:45.280 --> 00:49.034
I guess I always hoped that the longer
you're a couple, the easier it got.

00:49.720 --> 00:50.948
No noise.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.634
And the whole world gets it.
You love your body.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.314
Put your damn shirt on,
no one's making a calendar.

00:56.400 --> 01:00.109
And be a sweetie and get me a juice,
will you? Thanks so much.

01:00.200 --> 01:03.078
As much as it may seem
like it to me personally,

01:03.160 --> 01:07.995
I feel desperately compelled to remind
you that we are, in fact, not in prison.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.150
And I am just so not your bitch.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.708
Watch your language
in front of the baby.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.916
You're gonna have
to trust me on this one.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.197
Seeing as you're his mother,
he's gonna hear that word early,

01:18.280 --> 01:23.195
and he's gonna hear it often.
Like... non-stop.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.955
Maybe it's easier to be a new couple,
because you can't see what's ahead.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.794
T onight, I am going to make
all of your fantasies come true.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.509
You know, I would be happy
just to have sex above the covers once.

01:34.600 --> 01:39.071
Yeah. Never gonna happen.
Now, follow my voice to the bedroom.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.116
Over here.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.952
You're in trouble tonight.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.639
Oh, my God.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.156
Don't take the blindfold off!
I'll get a towel to stop the bleeding.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.630
The safest thing for a couple
is to find a routine and stick with it.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.879
T ed, have you noticed how happy
all the minions are lately?

01:58.960 --> 02:03.112
- I wish I was dead.
- Yep. People love working here.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.838
Good morning, sweetheart.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.830
It all makes me glad I'm on my own.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.353
I don't think I'd have it...

02:09.440 --> 02:10.872
Hello, ladies.

02:10.960 --> 02:14.077
Just window shopping,
or would you like to try something on?

02:14.160 --> 02:16.390
Aren't you the guy
that makes out with dogs?

02:17.400 --> 02:19.038
Carla. A quick word.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.400 --> 02:30.197
Is anybody else a doctor?

02:45.680 --> 02:48.717
I need you to extubate
the young fellow in 304

02:48.800 --> 02:52.236
and start an insulin drip on Mrs Adler
for the third time this month.

02:52.320 --> 02:56.279
God bless diabetics
who continue to drink. Oh, and Lassie.

02:56.360 --> 03:00.399
In response to the bestiality
rumours circulating about you,

03:00.480 --> 03:04.359
I've decided to forgo calling you
by the usual girl's name

03:04.440 --> 03:08.752
and instead I'm gonna refer to you
by whatever famous dog I can think of.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.990
I've gone with Lassie because,
of course,

03:11.080 --> 03:14.834
that satisfies the criteria
of being a girl and a dog's name,

03:14.920 --> 03:17.434
thus helping you
ease into the transition.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.556
I was just running kissing drills.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.200
Oh. That's completely normal, then.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.430
Don't bring that filth over here.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.273
Dude. TCW's back.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.397
TCW is a horrible story.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.109
She was married for three weeks before
her husband got in a car accident

03:36.200 --> 03:38.077
and became a total vegetable.

03:38.160 --> 03:41.789
He's been on life support for two years.
Since he was transferred to us,

03:41.880 --> 03:45.111
she's visited every Wednesday.
Very, very sad.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.792
Oh, and she's a babe. We call her
Tasty Coma Wife. Or TCW for short.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.552
- How's he doing?
- You know. He's the same.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.758
How are you doing?

04:01.840 --> 04:04.593
I was calculating how much time
I need to spend here

04:04.680 --> 04:07.069
so I don't feel guilty all week.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.709
Now I need to double it,
because I can't believe I said that.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.598
I think you're allowed to do
what you want, Mrs Moyer.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.558
- Please, call me Jamie.
- Jamie? OK.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.471
You have something on your cheek.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.075
What? Workin' in a hospital,
it's always something.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.116
- Yeah, I got it.
- Did you get it?

04:24.200 --> 04:26.111
No, not yet.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.916
- How we doin' today?
- Excellent, sir.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.150
- No one going to hell in here.
- Super.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.350
You've always known
about my sleep toots.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.556
You used to imitate the sound, remember?

04:50.320 --> 04:53.949
I make Mr Roberts
wear special air-tight boxer shorts.

04:55.240 --> 04:59.836
I wrote the guest list for this
conversation, and you're not on it, OK?

04:59.920 --> 05:01.717
So just... As for you,

05:01.800 --> 05:05.076
could you go one day without
making a big deal of everything?

05:05.160 --> 05:06.673
One damn day, woman.

05:06.760 --> 05:10.469
Carla, would you take this young
man back to his room in Paediatrics?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.915
Apparently as a form of social protest,

05:13.000 --> 05:16.959
he chewed on and subsequently
swallowed part of a Rolling Stones CD.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.395
Tell you what, Ralphie,
they sold out for good

05:19.480 --> 05:21.994
once they started doing
Ford commercials, eh?

05:24.760 --> 05:28.594
- We'll talk later.
- Come on, Ralphie.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.319
- I had that inside of me.
- What, now?

05:31.400 --> 05:33.470
He's just making stuff up. Come on.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.348
I swallowed that ring.
My dad had to wait for me to go No.2.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.954
The black doctor gave me ten bucks
to keep quiet.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.033
Good show today.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.270
Elliot. A blindfold?

05:53.360 --> 05:58.070
- Way to step it up, Miss Nasty.
- You told him what happened.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.435
We were bonding.
What are you eating?

06:00.520 --> 06:03.318
Turkey jerky. Protein, baby. Go for it.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.913
- No, thanks.
- Don't like it?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.479
- Never tried it.
- Never?

06:06.560 --> 06:08.312
Jerky rocks. You'll love it.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.392
I've put a lot of thought into this
and I'll have to pass.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.358
So, eight stitches,
and now you don't trust me?

06:14.440 --> 06:16.556
And you wanted above-the-covers sex!

06:18.600 --> 06:20.352
I feel your pain.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.476
Luckily, I'm a competent enough doctor,

06:23.560 --> 06:26.870
I'm not gonna let myself get distracted
thinking about Jamie.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.997
Can you really hear my heart
if it isn't in your ears?

06:30.080 --> 06:33.038
- Did you go to med school?
- No, I mean...

06:33.120 --> 06:34.872
No, you didn't. Thank you.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.678
The problem is that I'm in a rut.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.479
I just need someone to go out
and get a beer with me.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.198
I can't tonight.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.955
If I have more than one beer,
I'll most likely kill myself.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.431
Can't. You seen Turk?

06:49.520 --> 06:51.192
Married.

06:54.120 --> 06:57.908
- Can't swing it tonight.
- Come on, player, just a few beers.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.197
And if we accidentally run into
some skanky hos, then so be it.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.793
I'll go.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.110
I totally need to blow off some steam.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.749
Plus, the best way to meet skanky hos
is to already have a girl with you.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.035
- Not that I need any help.
- Pff! Hell, no!

07:11.960 --> 07:13.313
You got something...

07:18.680 --> 07:22.309
Oh, my God.
I gotta tell you about that day.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.913
I haven't named him yet.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.197
I've been calling him Monkey Face.
They'd tease him at school.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.191
Seriously, I had this one patient...

07:29.280 --> 07:31.430
He's got a boodgie like a grape
in his nose.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.671
Would you run back to the hospital
for a suction thingy?

07:34.760 --> 07:37.479
If I'm not back in 20 minutes,
I don't want you to worry

07:37.560 --> 07:41.235
because it simply means I drove
by a prostitute on the way home.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.151
Make sure it's a girl.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.795
Please don't do this.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.236
- Do what?
- The whole drama-queen thing.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.437
The jerky incident is what
is wrong with our relationship.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.509
Thank you.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.668
Every lunch, someone hits me
with a spit-ball.

08:02.760 --> 08:06.230
I'm still not sure how I feel
about Paul and Elliot.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.793
Nice day, huh?

08:10.880 --> 08:12.996
Always got something to say, don't you?

08:13.080 --> 08:15.674
Old Nosy Nelly
always gotta throw his two cents in.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.354
OK, I'm sorry about the nice-day thing.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.749
How can I make this right?

08:20.840 --> 08:22.876
What's it, biscuit and gravy day?

08:22.960 --> 08:26.236
- Yeah.
- Just give me one of them biscuits.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.239
I thought you were ready.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.030
How does
this whole wing-man thing work?

08:35.120 --> 08:37.918
Essentially, you have to think
of yourself as chum.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.879
Your job as chum is to lure
attractive women closer to the boat.

08:41.960 --> 08:45.316
Mental note. The Boat could be
a very cool new nickname.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.675
Hey, baby. Would you like some of this?

08:47.760 --> 08:49.671
- Look at that.
- No, no, Jamie.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.512
A little aggressive. Sorry.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.397
- Did you like her?
- No, no.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.789
Her ass was way too perfect.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.239
- Can't believe I'm having fun.
- I'm glad.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.118
So, Tasty Coma Wife, huh?

09:04.080 --> 09:05.718
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.189
I've heard some idiots call you that.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.077
- I kinda like it.
- I thought it up.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.639
Cheers.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.271
Is this true?

09:17.200 --> 09:20.556
- Ralphie, I paid you ten dollars.
- This is disgusting.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.790
- Why is it?
- Because it was in my butt.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.678
I'm serious. I want you to shut up.
Shut your mouth now.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.318
- Would you wear this?
- Baby!

09:27.400 --> 09:29.709
I've had this steam-cleaned three times.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.189
Not only would I wear it,
I'll put it in my mouth.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.233
What?

09:39.080 --> 09:41.469
It's fun to eat things.

09:49.720 --> 09:50.948
Scooby.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.679
A married woman whose husband
is still in a coma?

09:54.760 --> 09:58.514
Can't tell you how many happy couples
I know who got started just that way.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.716
Will you relax? We just got a beer.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.631
What you got there?

10:02.720 --> 10:05.917
One hundred free booger suckers
and you'll say nothing.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.471
Toto, please, oh, please,
keep hanging out with her.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.235
Because I'm gonna enjoy watching
this one bite you right on the ass.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.629
And I good and guarantee you, she will.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.348
People in relationships
always dole out advice

10:22.440 --> 10:25.591
even though they're usually
the ones that are messed up.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.113
See you, Elliot.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.192
Whether they're considering
breaking up over a Slim Jim.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.752
Or having their stomach pumped.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.675
Or just desperately trying
to get attention.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.198
So I'm not gonna sweat it
just because I made a new friend.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.872
I mean, what's the big deal?

10:53.680 --> 10:56.831
- Hey.
- Hey...

10:56.920 --> 10:58.990
May I come in?

11:06.160 --> 11:09.914
- He likes you.
- He must smell my dead dog.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.675
You haven't asked why I called
your work, pretended to be your sister,

11:13.760 --> 11:16.399
got your address,
and showed up late at night.

11:16.480 --> 11:20.473
You've got a lot going on right now.
I'm sure you're a little confused.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.755
It's time for me to start my life over.

11:22.840 --> 11:26.230
I would love to take you out to dinner,
if you'd be interested.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.753
Holy crap!

11:27.840 --> 11:30.638
Jack wouldn't want my life to be over.
My husband.

11:30.720 --> 11:31.948
- Mr Moyer.
- Call him Jack.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.076
- I'd rather not.
- I know it's weird.

11:34.160 --> 11:37.072
- But give it some thought, OK?
- Of course.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.911
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.036
- All right, I'll see you.
- Yeah.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.075
Dude. Was that...

11:52.160 --> 11:54.276
Was that Tasty Coma Wife?

11:54.360 --> 11:55.429
Yeah.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.952
You'll figure out what to do.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.996
For God's sakes, you're The Boat.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.116
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Jack.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.270
- What?
- Cold chart.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.192
Good cover.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.919
Five letters. "Showing vulnerability."

12:13.000 --> 12:15.116
"A blank in one's armour."

12:16.400 --> 12:18.709
- Chink.
- What?

12:18.800 --> 12:20.870
Chink!

12:22.160 --> 12:24.196
No. No, Franklyn, we were...

12:24.280 --> 12:26.669
We were doing
a crossword puzzle and...

12:28.920 --> 12:31.480
- I always suspected.
- We all did.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.872
Franklyn, no.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.791
Wow. Tough break.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.794
OK, Mrs Brady, we'll break up
your kidney stone with lithotripsy.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.155
We're gonna put you on Percocet
for the pain.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.037
I can't take painkillers.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.917
Justin's still breastfeeding.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.790
You like milk, do you?

12:52.880 --> 12:55.917
Why don't you get on your bike,
go to the store and get some?

12:56.000 --> 12:59.231
I think at a certain point,
breastfeeding becomes creepy.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.756
- You are such a little cutie.
- Mom, I'm trying to eat here.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.717
- But...
- Mom.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.877
Benji, come.

13:10.840 --> 13:13.308
What is with mothers
doting on their children?

13:13.400 --> 13:17.154
My God. It's like nobody else
exists in the world anymore.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.515
But I tell you,
and you can take it to the bank,

13:19.600 --> 13:21.989
my mother never paid
that much attention to me.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.799
- It doesn't show.
- Word to the wise there, Astro.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.429
Sarcasm does not sit well with
the Big Dog, so consider this a warning.

13:28.520 --> 13:32.149
The next time I hear you mumble some
little passive-aggressive aside,

13:32.240 --> 13:35.232
I'll look into your heart,
pick out your insecurity,

13:35.320 --> 13:38.278
and shine a spotlight on it
for the remainder of your days.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.157
Now, riddle me this, Fido.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.516
Just exactly why does every Asian person
who's passing us by

13:43.600 --> 13:45.511
keep giving you the old stink-eye?

13:45.600 --> 13:47.670
Oh, you're imagining things.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.517
Ow.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.636
It's just been hard for me lately.

13:55.720 --> 13:58.075
I don't really have anyone
special in my life.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.958
I'm pretty much either here
or at home doing nothing.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.634
Yeah, that's rough. I'm in a coma!

14:03.720 --> 14:06.757
I've had an itch on my foot
for the last eight months.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.198
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. It's a new therapy.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.275
You'd trust me on something
important to me?

14:15.360 --> 14:16.429
Course.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.317
See? That's what I'm looking for.

14:18.720 --> 14:22.076
We're talking about dried meat.
Why would you get in the middle?

14:22.160 --> 14:23.912
I don't know what I was thinking.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.958
- Is that a straw?
- No, this is just a pen.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.758
Pink scrubs.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.194
Well, there it is,
all cleaned up for you. Enjoy.

14:33.280 --> 14:37.353
Well, why don't you keep it?
In case you get hungry later.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.715
Oh, you think that's funny,
huh, Ralphie?

14:39.800 --> 14:41.631
Pay me my ten dollars.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.634
Son, a hospital staff
is like a melting pot.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.790
We all need to respect each other.

14:47.880 --> 14:53.193
If you think a specific ethnic group
is loud, lazy or sneaky...

14:53.280 --> 14:55.874
Or incredibly closed-minded
and inappropriate.

14:55.960 --> 14:59.157
Exactly!
Just keep it to yourself, dammit!

15:00.840 --> 15:01.989
What?

15:02.080 --> 15:05.038
Nothing, sir.
I just thought of something funny.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.749
Maybe what you should do
is saddle up your mop and head upstairs.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.719
Someone has vomited in the second,
third and fifth-floor hallways.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.756
What? It's not my fault.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.990
Ralphie. Let's ride.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.951
Good work. Here's your 20 bucks.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.951
You can throw up whenever you want to?

15:27.040 --> 15:29.315
- Hell, yeah.
- We should look into that.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.517
You know, right after you
blow chunks in the elevator.

15:32.600 --> 15:36.036
- Hey, stranger.
- Hot!

15:36.120 --> 15:39.078
It's weird realising you missed someone
you barely know.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.037
Wait. Make me proud.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.432
Good God.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.997
I decided to take Jamie out on a date.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.640
- Who?
- You know, T asty Coma Wife?

15:51.720 --> 15:53.073
- No way.
- Nice job, Hooch.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.116
T ell you what.
Give me a little time,

15:55.200 --> 15:57.873
and I'll rig it so that
the husband can come with you.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.997
I'll have him sittin' up
right next to you, no problemo.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.958
- What do you say?
- I'm free and I love ltalian.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.157
- You be quiet.
- I can't believe you, Bambi.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.356
- She is so right.
- What are you thinking?

16:09.440 --> 16:12.000
Oh, Rin-Tin-Tin-Tin-Tin-Tin-Tin.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.072
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
And shut up! OK?

16:15.160 --> 16:16.957
Who are you to give me advice?

16:17.040 --> 16:21.079
All you do is just bitch about
your relationships all day long.

16:21.160 --> 16:24.596
You know what? Glare all you want,
Big Dog, cos I'm not afraid of you.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.069
"Jordan's only paying
attention to the baby."

16:27.160 --> 16:29.435
Must be so hard for Dr Look At Me.
Isn't it?

16:29.520 --> 16:31.397
Look at me!

16:31.480 --> 16:34.153
And you two?
You're arguing since you got engaged?

16:34.240 --> 16:36.879
You're probably the first couple
to do that ever.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.110
It can't be that you're just scared,
is it?

16:39.200 --> 16:42.636
And you. Let's just forget
for one second that, a month ago,

16:42.720 --> 16:45.075
you told me you couldn't be
in a relationship.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.912
Because, for me, it's actually fun

16:47.000 --> 16:50.037
to watch you sabotage
your relationship from the outside.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.594
The only thing that gives me comfort,
you guys,

16:52.680 --> 16:55.114
is while I'm at home,
staring at the ceiling,

16:55.200 --> 16:57.191
just wishing I had someone to talk to,

16:57.280 --> 17:00.636
is knowing none of you idiots
realise how lucky you are.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.637
Did I miss something good?

17:11.079 --> 17:13.594
- Thank you so much for dinner.
- You're welcome.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.955
But what was the deal
with tipping $20 on a $30 bill?

17:17.040 --> 17:20.794
Ah, nothing. I just love Chinese food.
And the Asian people.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.637
What should we do now?

17:23.720 --> 17:25.597
Kiss me.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.472
I could do that.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.794
Mm. You went left. Very cool.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.632
Thank you, Rowdy.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.156
So, it's cold outside.
You wanna come back to my place?

17:50.600 --> 17:53.990
I think you might be moving
a little fast for yourself.

17:54.080 --> 17:57.595
And there's a part of me
that's very angry I just said that.

17:59.080 --> 18:02.311
I'm so sick of being alone, you know?

18:02.400 --> 18:04.152
Tell you what, look me in the eyes

18:04.240 --> 18:07.915
and tell me that you're ready
to start something right now,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.672
we won't even need a cab.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.557
I will throw you over my shoulder

18:11.640 --> 18:14.950
and just sprint
the 1 2 miles to your house.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.478
But...

18:18.560 --> 18:20.471
I'll call you sometime.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.398
I hope you do.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.188
Bye.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.513
I don't think people
are meant to be by themselves.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.037
That's why, if you actually
find someone you care about...

18:56.840 --> 18:59.354
...it's important to let go
of the little things.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.231
Even if you can't let go all the way.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.238
Because nothing sucks more
than feeling all alone.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.279
No matter how many people are around.
