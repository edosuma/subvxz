<i>Previously on "Blindspot"...</i>

00:04.295 --> 00:06.163
(Jane) I see the way
that you look at me,

00:06.286 --> 00:09.489
and I don't know how to be
this person that you lost.

00:09.571 --> 00:11.380
I know you want Jane
to be Taylor Shaw...

00:11.415 --> 00:14.070
Look, this has nothing
to do with what I want.

00:14.136 --> 00:16.256
(Sarah) Dad's been accused of kidnapping
her, of killing her.

00:16.291 --> 00:17.468
Hello, son.

00:17.558 --> 00:18.787
(Patterson)
Saul Guerrero.

00:18.822 --> 00:21.137
You're listed as
the case officer.

00:21.261 --> 00:23.202
Let's talk about
Jane Doe.

00:23.755 --> 00:25.370
(Weller)
I know being Taylor

00:25.405 --> 00:27.788
might not be an answer to
all of your problems.

00:27.823 --> 00:29.276
It's a starting point.

00:29.311 --> 00:30.598
(Jane)
I think you're wrong.

00:30.633 --> 00:33.818
You... you're
my starting point.

(alarm beeping,

01:19.186 --> 01:21.746
(Sarah)
Okay, got your stuff.

01:21.781 --> 01:24.533
Clothes, toothbrush.

01:25.593 --> 01:26.821
You slept here?

01:26.856 --> 01:27.976
Yeah.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.202
Okay, look.

01:32.237 --> 01:33.676
I know I shouldn't
have brought Dad

01:33.711 --> 01:35.630
into your home
without asking.

01:35.904 --> 01:38.271
But I know if I asked,
you would've said no.

01:38.346 --> 01:39.949
Which is why you
shouldn't have done it.

01:40.785 --> 01:42.842
You could have at least,
you know, shaken his hand

01:42.877 --> 01:44.190
or said hi.

01:44.225 --> 01:45.732
I won't talk
about this here.

01:45.767 --> 01:47.650
Well, when do you wanna
talk about it, Kurt?

01:48.033 --> 01:50.661
Taylor is alive,
Dad is innocent.

01:50.696 --> 01:52.687
Her being back does
not change the fact

01:52.722 --> 01:54.280
that someone
kidnapped her.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.427
So, then talk me
through your version.

01:56.462 --> 01:58.076
What, he got off
his shift, he abducted

01:58.111 --> 01:59.548
the five-year-old
girl next door,

01:59.583 --> 02:01.062
and then sold her on
the black market and came home

02:01.097 --> 02:03.025
in time for the evening news?
I mean, what?

02:03.060 --> 02:04.643
Someone knows what
happened that night.

02:04.678 --> 02:06.453
It's not you
and it's not me.

02:06.488 --> 02:08.520
So you still really
think he did it?

02:08.731 --> 02:10.451
Or have you just been
mad at him so long,

02:10.488 --> 02:11.808
you don't know
how to stop?

02:11.843 --> 02:13.510
I want him gone by
the time I get home.

02:13.578 --> 02:14.711
Okay, well, you don't
need to worry about it

02:14.779 --> 02:16.262
'cause he's already
at a hotel.

02:16.297 --> 02:18.615
He's just here
for some treatments.

02:19.651 --> 02:21.618
He's still trying
to beat it?

02:21.686 --> 02:24.087
No, Kurt.

02:24.155 --> 02:26.590
They're just trying
to slow it down.

02:30.762 --> 02:32.829
I gotta get
back to work.

02:32.897 --> 02:34.865
Thanks for the clothes.

02:37.977 --> 02:40.512
(sports game playing on TV)

02:45.678 --> 02:47.712
(knocking on door)

02:52.634 --> 02:53.980
What am I about to say?

02:54.015 --> 02:57.054
"Three days are up.
Where's your cash?"

02:57.121 --> 02:58.626
I'm working on it.

02:58.661 --> 03:01.511
Oh, no, come on.

03:01.546 --> 03:03.660
Don't make me
be this guy,

03:03.728 --> 03:06.163
walking in here,
you know, talking about

03:06.198 --> 03:08.432
breaking legs
or worse.

03:08.691 --> 03:10.136
Ow!
Ah, ah!

03:10.171 --> 03:12.387
Do you know what
I do for a living?

03:12.422 --> 03:14.237
Yeah, I do.
And what's the FBI's stance

03:14.305 --> 03:15.807
on agents with illegal
gambling debts?

03:15.842 --> 03:17.842
What, you're gonna tell on me?
You're my bookie.

03:17.877 --> 03:19.699
I'm saying, you don't pay,
it's out of my hands.

03:19.734 --> 03:21.825
My bosses do what they do
to protect their reputation.

03:21.860 --> 03:23.691
You wanna let go
of my arm now?!

03:23.726 --> 03:24.915
Oww!

03:24.983 --> 03:27.317
(panting)

03:27.385 --> 03:29.089
That's a bad play, Tash.

03:29.124 --> 03:30.869
One more day,
I'll have your money.

03:30.904 --> 03:32.257
You better,
'cause the next time,

03:32.292 --> 03:34.744
the conversation
ends different.

03:37.996 --> 03:39.497
(door closes)

03:40.942 --> 03:43.836
A breakthrough?
It was a dream.

03:43.871 --> 03:45.032
(Borden)
Your first dream,

03:45.067 --> 03:46.530
which you considered
significant enough

03:46.565 --> 03:47.904
to mention to me.

03:47.972 --> 03:49.573
A sex dream.

03:52.272 --> 03:53.399
So what does it mean?

03:53.434 --> 03:54.778
Well, that depends
on who you ask.

03:54.846 --> 03:56.561
Most people believe that
dreams are the brain's way

03:56.596 --> 03:59.598
of processing how we
feel about things.

03:59.751 --> 04:01.352
So, who do you
think he was,

04:01.387 --> 04:02.953
this dream man?

04:05.043 --> 04:08.212
Um, something tells me
you have a theory.

04:09.477 --> 04:11.069
What, you think
it's Weller?

04:11.104 --> 04:13.663
You said that,
not me.

04:13.731 --> 04:16.526
(Mayfair) I hear you had
Jane over for dinner.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.422
Yeah, it was
my sister's idea.

04:20.071 --> 04:21.589
How worried
do I have to be

04:21.625 --> 04:24.409
about your objectivity
on this case?

04:24.444 --> 04:27.014
You don't.
It was a family dinner.

04:27.049 --> 04:29.017
I mean, my nephew
was there, it was...

04:29.052 --> 04:30.504
there was nothing
inappropriate.

04:30.539 --> 04:34.135
No.
No, I ju... no, I...

04:34.170 --> 04:37.817
That guy had a tattoo
of a tree on his arm,

04:37.852 --> 04:39.162
and Weller
doesn't have that.

04:39.197 --> 04:41.761
Dreams aren't literal,
they're impressionistic.

04:41.796 --> 04:43.396
Your body is covered
in tattoos,

04:43.431 --> 04:45.896
symbols you
don't understand.

04:45.963 --> 04:49.164
Now, you described it
as a tree with deep roots.

04:49.199 --> 04:52.248
Maybe you're searching
for stability, strength.

04:52.283 --> 04:53.240
Those are certainly
qualities

04:53.275 --> 04:54.999
that Agent Weller
seems to project.

04:55.034 --> 04:56.331
I'm speaking generally.

04:56.366 --> 04:58.479
Normally your judgment
is beyond reproach.

04:58.514 --> 04:59.551
But with her?

04:59.586 --> 05:02.562
Look, we all know this
is an unusual situation.

05:02.597 --> 05:04.342
Which is why
I need to know

05:04.377 --> 05:06.164
that you're rock solid
out there,

05:06.199 --> 05:09.039
that you're seeing
things clearly.

05:09.074 --> 05:10.373
I am.

05:10.408 --> 05:12.263
I'm saying you're not.

05:12.298 --> 05:13.741
Your relationship
with Agent Weller

05:13.776 --> 05:16.263
is... complicated.

05:16.298 --> 05:18.405
He's your colleague,
your protector,

05:18.440 --> 05:19.847
your childhood friend.

05:19.882 --> 05:23.031
Yeah, and now he's in
my dreams. He's everywhere.

05:23.066 --> 05:25.032
I think we need to
consider you stepping down

05:25.067 --> 05:27.199
as lead agent
on this case.

05:27.234 --> 05:29.605
It's not necessary.

05:29.791 --> 05:32.114
(Borden) Maybe you need to establish
clearer boundaries.

05:32.149 --> 05:33.195
How do I do that?

05:33.230 --> 05:34.455
To start...

05:34.490 --> 05:35.876
try keeping your
interactions with him

05:35.911 --> 05:38.273
limited to
a professional context.

05:38.308 --> 05:40.425
At least for now.

05:40.460 --> 05:41.656
Right.

05:42.834 --> 05:45.754
(locker shutting)

05:45.789 --> 05:46.690
Mornin'.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.038
Hey.

05:49.623 --> 05:51.658
Your holster's in
the wrong position again.

05:52.930 --> 05:54.560
Right, sorry.

05:54.595 --> 05:56.585
There's just so much new
stuff for me to remember.

05:56.620 --> 05:58.467
We've already
talked about this.

05:58.502 --> 05:59.245
If we're in a firefight

05:59.280 --> 06:00.700
and your gun's
in the wrong position,

06:00.735 --> 06:02.682
that mistake could cost
someone their life.

06:02.717 --> 06:04.250
I said I was sorry, okay?

06:04.285 --> 06:05.472
I don't need an apology.

06:05.507 --> 06:07.341
I just need you
to make that adjustment.

06:17.284 --> 06:18.183
Falcon is two minutes out.

06:18.218 --> 06:20.700
Switch to alternate route
Bravo-three.

06:26.014 --> 06:27.514
(tires screeching)

06:29.686 --> 06:31.020
(man)
Everybody down!

06:34.942 --> 06:36.514
(man)
No! No!

06:37.317 --> 06:38.684
Oh, oh, God!

06:50.693 --> 06:52.060
Uhh!

06:58.501 --> 07:01.576
The target was Saudi Prince
Fawwaz al Aziz.

07:01.611 --> 07:03.348
He was in town
on a peace summit.

07:03.383 --> 07:05.570
There's been a lot of chatter
about Saudi extremist groups

07:05.605 --> 07:06.926
targeting the Royal family.

07:06.961 --> 07:08.737
Secret Service routes
are classified.

07:08.772 --> 07:10.141
They tend to
change the day of.

07:10.176 --> 07:12.482
So how did these guys pull off
an attack this coordinated?

07:12.517 --> 07:14.443
Because they had this.

07:14.478 --> 07:15.588
One of the shooters
had a mobile app

07:15.623 --> 07:18.181
that I'd never heard of
called TRAKZER.

07:18.216 --> 07:20.610
It hacks into the GPS signals
from "Blue Force trackers"

07:20.645 --> 07:24.445
on government vehicles and
maps their exact location.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.263
Where'd they get this
and who else has it?

07:26.298 --> 07:27.939
The transactions
are untraceable.

07:27.974 --> 07:29.608
Probably done through
the Dark Web.

07:29.643 --> 07:31.540
The Dark Web?

07:31.575 --> 07:33.011
That doesn't sound good,
what is that?

07:33.046 --> 07:34.865
95% of the Internet
isn't indexed

07:34.900 --> 07:36.692
on commercial
search engines.

07:36.727 --> 07:38.274
Yeah, the Dark Web
is like the Wild West.

07:38.309 --> 07:40.676
Everything from weapons
to sex trafficking.

07:40.711 --> 07:41.953
Yeah, and now,
assassinations.

07:41.988 --> 07:43.930
Shouldn't we hand this over
to the Cyber Division?

07:43.965 --> 07:46.154
Here, take a look
at the app's logo.

07:48.389 --> 07:50.327
That owl's on my leg.

07:50.362 --> 07:51.552
(Patterson)
Exactly.

07:51.587 --> 07:53.582
So, whoever did this
to her knew about the app?

07:53.617 --> 07:56.467
How many government vehicles
have these trackers?

07:56.502 --> 07:57.969
All of them.

07:58.910 --> 08:01.146
So every single
government agent

08:01.181 --> 08:04.702
is now a potential target...
including us.

08:09.548 --> 08:13.684

08:14.679 --> 08:19.679
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

08:25.037 --> 08:28.156
Last month, two undercover
LAPD cops got executed

08:28.191 --> 08:30.501
in their unmarked car
by converging vehicles.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.972
No one could figure out how
they coordinated the attacks.

08:33.006 --> 08:34.383
They tracked
their patrol car.

08:34.451 --> 08:36.301
More variations
on the same theme.

08:36.336 --> 08:38.921
An ambush in a prison bus
convoy in Houston.

08:38.956 --> 08:40.578
A federal witness
killed in D.C.

08:40.614 --> 08:42.017
TRAKZER's gone national.

08:42.052 --> 08:43.687
And the death toll's rising.

08:43.722 --> 08:45.461
We gotta shut
this down fast.

08:47.397 --> 08:48.998
Whoever wrote this app
made it look like

08:49.066 --> 08:51.028
it's being hosted
by a government network.

08:51.063 --> 08:52.535
Any attack that
we launch on it

08:52.570 --> 08:53.976
would be hitting
our own systems.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.165
Great.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.419
So, shutting
this thing down

08:56.454 --> 08:58.540
is like trying to find
a needle in a haystack.

08:58.575 --> 09:01.339
No, it's like finding a piece
of hay in a haystack,

09:01.374 --> 09:03.856
like a very
specific piece of hay

09:03.891 --> 09:04.902
- in the haystack.
- Yeah.

09:04.937 --> 09:06.383
Okay, well,
you totally get it.

09:06.418 --> 09:07.783
Yeah.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.577
Actually...

09:09.612 --> 09:11.587
Wait a second,
I have an idea.

09:11.655 --> 09:14.290
I checked the signature elements
in TRAKZER's source code

09:14.358 --> 09:16.592
against our malware database.

09:16.660 --> 09:18.685
I understood
the word "database."

09:18.720 --> 09:21.720
Each programmer has a...
a distinctive coding style.

09:21.755 --> 09:23.443
- Like a fingerprint.
- Exactly.

09:23.478 --> 09:25.419
And fingerprints
from the software

09:25.454 --> 09:27.111
match a recent
Hackathon winner.

09:27.146 --> 09:29.884
Sponsored contests for
recruiting programmers.

09:29.919 --> 09:32.087
Now, check out
the winner's username.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.308
The Horned Owl.

09:35.463 --> 09:37.866
That's our guy.
How do we find him?

09:37.901 --> 09:40.473
I traced the P.O. Box
on his Hackathon entry form,

09:40.508 --> 09:42.951
and it routes to an
apartment in Bed-Stuy.

09:42.986 --> 09:44.457
Hay in a haystack.

09:44.492 --> 09:46.824
Nice work.
Let's go get him.

09:54.129 --> 09:56.831
(rock music playing
in distance)

10:06.605 --> 10:09.273
No.
Reade, you're up.

10:10.820 --> 10:12.668
Bust it.

10:12.703 --> 10:15.766
(rock music blasting)
<i>â™ª Hey! Hey! Hey! â™ª</i>

10:15.801 --> 10:17.352
FBI, show me your hands!

10:17.387 --> 10:18.038
- What's going...
- Put your hands up!

10:18.073 --> 10:19.743
What's going on?!

10:19.778 --> 10:20.956
(Zapata)
Clear.

10:20.991 --> 10:21.892
Clear.

10:21.927 --> 10:23.298
Turn the music off!

10:23.333 --> 10:24.594
- Turn it off!
- (music stops)

10:24.661 --> 10:25.705
Does anyone else
live here?

10:25.740 --> 10:27.263
No, what is this?

10:27.331 --> 10:28.931
That owl on the door...

10:28.999 --> 10:30.075
that symbol,
is that you?

10:30.110 --> 10:31.956
- Yes.
- You created TRAKZER?

10:31.991 --> 10:35.571
Of course I did.
I created it for you.

10:36.673 --> 10:39.475
I work for the U.S. government.

10:43.592 --> 10:47.110
<i>Ana Montes,
I'm Special Agent Zapata.</i>

10:47.507 --> 10:48.580
<i>I'm not saying anything</i>

10:48.615 --> 10:51.541
<i>unless it's my direct
point of contact.</i>

10:52.594 --> 10:54.838
Right... and that's...

10:54.873 --> 10:58.147
Leonard Gail,
National Security Agency,

10:58.182 --> 11:01.060
Information Systems
and Security Division.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.848
And you do what
for the NSA, exactly?

11:02.883 --> 11:05.066
Nothing you're cleared
to hear about.

11:05.101 --> 11:08.838
Just have your boss
call Leonard Gail.

11:09.518 --> 11:11.154
(speaking in Spanish)
_

11:11.574 --> 11:14.063
_

11:15.091 --> 11:16.537
_

11:17.375 --> 11:19.790
Okay, so because my
last name is Montes,

11:19.825 --> 11:22.160
you think
I speak Spanish?

11:22.452 --> 11:24.439
I read your
Social Services file.

11:24.474 --> 11:26.167
I know your parents
passed away,

11:26.202 --> 11:29.358
and I am sorry
to hear that.

11:31.261 --> 11:32.639
I get it.

11:32.674 --> 11:33.706
My dad left
when I was five,

11:33.741 --> 11:35.297
my mom was an alcoholic.

11:35.332 --> 11:38.234
My brothers and I practically
raised each other.

11:38.564 --> 11:40.492
(speaking in Spanish)
_

11:40.527 --> 11:43.083
_

11:43.439 --> 11:44.784
_

11:44.995 --> 11:46.029
(chuckles)

11:49.225 --> 11:51.794
(door opens and closes)

11:53.638 --> 11:55.025
I hate teenage girls.

11:55.060 --> 11:57.453
I'm gonna go get Weller.
Stay here.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.716
What part of
"I'm not talking"

12:11.751 --> 12:14.453
don't you people
understand?

12:17.040 --> 12:19.570
What is this?

12:20.475 --> 12:21.901
Where did you
get that?

12:21.936 --> 12:22.742
I don't know.

12:22.777 --> 12:24.294
It's on your leg
and you don't know?

12:24.329 --> 12:25.948
Look, it's hard
to explain.

12:25.983 --> 12:28.918
Please, can you just
tell me what it is?

12:29.300 --> 12:31.820
She got a healthy imagination,
I'll give her that.

12:31.855 --> 12:33.344
She could be
telling the truth.

12:33.379 --> 12:34.690
I mean, federal agencies
hire hackers

12:34.725 --> 12:36.393
to red-team them all the time,
it's how they find

12:36.428 --> 12:38.393
the vulnerabilities
in their security systems.

12:38.428 --> 12:39.906
She's 17.

12:39.941 --> 12:41.719
Yeah, for a hacker,
she's in her prime.

12:41.754 --> 12:44.892
I just spoke to my
NSA counterpart.

12:44.927 --> 12:46.779
Leonard Gail
doesn't exist.

12:46.814 --> 12:47.895
I knew she was lying.

12:47.930 --> 12:49.894
Or, Leonard Gail does exist

12:49.929 --> 12:51.847
and the NSA is lying,
like they've lied

12:51.882 --> 12:53.858
to everyone about
everything ever.

12:53.893 --> 12:55.777
Well, what does
your gut tell you?

12:55.812 --> 12:57.451
Are we dealing with
a government agent

12:57.486 --> 13:00.698
or a kid who's read
too many spy novels?

13:01.210 --> 13:02.985
What if it's neither?

13:03.219 --> 13:06.558
So, the owl is just
a personal thing?

13:06.615 --> 13:08.188
It didn't come
from anywhere else?

13:08.239 --> 13:11.169
Because we can't find it
referenced anywhere.

13:11.282 --> 13:13.995
Did you design it?

13:14.030 --> 13:15.631
No.

13:16.019 --> 13:18.020
Well, do you
know who did?

13:20.432 --> 13:22.099
My brother.

13:25.112 --> 13:28.343
I saw in your file that
he was killed last year.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.613
I'm sorry.

13:31.147 --> 13:33.610
Do you live
alone now?

13:36.460 --> 13:38.553
Me, too.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.824
It's hard,
all that quiet.

13:42.854 --> 13:43.959
I'm used to it.

13:44.237 --> 13:46.038
I'm not.

13:49.378 --> 13:51.934
My brother was older.

13:52.275 --> 13:55.471
He mostly worked nights.
I was alone a lot.

13:56.030 --> 13:58.657
So he drew that
owl above my bed,

13:58.692 --> 14:00.443
so I wouldn't be scared.

14:01.009 --> 14:03.571
That thing was supposed
to make you <i>less</i> scared?

14:03.606 --> 14:05.573
(laughs)

14:06.549 --> 14:08.284
Well, owls are nocturnal,

14:08.319 --> 14:11.006
so he said it would
keep away the bad guys.

14:11.041 --> 14:12.788
Did it work?

14:13.072 --> 14:14.238
No.

14:17.085 --> 14:19.695
Your brother sounds
pretty special.

14:22.026 --> 14:24.074
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

14:27.321 --> 14:28.990
Did you talk
to Leonard Gail?

14:31.207 --> 14:32.674
What did he say?

14:33.765 --> 14:36.045
We talked to the NSA.

14:36.168 --> 14:37.683
He doesn't exist.

14:37.898 --> 14:39.368
You're saying
I'm a liar?

14:39.403 --> 14:41.729
No, I'm saying that
you were probably conned

14:41.764 --> 14:43.893
by someone who claims
they work for the NSA.

14:43.928 --> 14:45.472
(scoffs)
Of course the NSA

14:45.507 --> 14:46.691
told you that Leonard
doesn't exist.

14:46.726 --> 14:49.406
His job is like 100 levels
above your clearance.

14:53.188 --> 14:54.254
Look at these.

14:57.693 --> 15:02.565
They're recent crimes targeted
at government vehicles...

15:02.600 --> 15:05.328
which were located
by your software.

15:08.777 --> 15:09.439
No.

15:09.474 --> 15:10.802
(Weller)
Yes.

15:10.837 --> 15:13.642
No, my... my software
isn't real.

15:13.677 --> 15:15.147
It was just
a proof of concept.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.006
It wasn't for people
to actually use.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.700
Well, "people" are using it.

15:21.740 --> 15:24.364
Did you ever meet
Leonard Gail in person?

15:26.585 --> 15:27.831
No.

15:27.866 --> 15:30.741
You didn't give your
software to the good guys.

15:30.776 --> 15:32.791
You gave it to someone
very dangerous.

15:32.826 --> 15:34.261
And every second
it's out there,

15:34.296 --> 15:36.476
more lives are at risk.

15:36.511 --> 15:38.478
People are dying, Ana.

15:38.513 --> 15:40.127
Oh, my God.

15:40.162 --> 15:43.576
Ana, we need you to get
this software offline.

15:43.611 --> 15:44.918
- I can't.
- (Weller) You have to.

15:44.953 --> 15:47.274
No, you don't understand.

15:47.309 --> 15:49.744
There's no way for me
to shut it down.

15:57.735 --> 15:59.484
What do you mean
you can't shut it down?

15:59.519 --> 16:02.539
Look, TRAKZER isn't
on my servers.

16:02.574 --> 16:03.939
It's on Shawn's.

16:03.974 --> 16:05.320
Who is Shawn?

16:05.355 --> 16:06.879
Shawn Palmer.

16:06.914 --> 16:08.563
He approached me online
a few months ago.

16:08.598 --> 16:11.174
He said that he was
hiring freelancers

16:11.209 --> 16:13.332
for his cyber
security firm.

16:13.367 --> 16:15.936
So, I did a few projects
for him and then he said

16:15.971 --> 16:17.064
he wanted to meet
me in person,

16:17.099 --> 16:18.669
that he had this
big opportunity.

16:18.704 --> 16:20.101
All right,
so he was the guy

16:20.136 --> 16:21.864
that said he worked
for the NSA.

16:21.899 --> 16:25.160
Yes, and other,
less-reputable businesses.

16:25.195 --> 16:27.231
Look, he said the NSA
wanted to test

16:27.266 --> 16:28.847
their GPS security,

16:28.882 --> 16:30.847
and he told them that
if I couldn't break in,

16:30.882 --> 16:32.344
that nobody could.

16:32.379 --> 16:34.932
He promised that they'd
hook me up with a job after

16:34.967 --> 16:37.603
if I pulled it off.
So, I wrote the code

16:37.638 --> 16:39.893
and then he sent it
to his contact.

16:39.928 --> 16:42.675
(Jane)
Leonard Gail.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.731
You didn't check
into Shawn's story?

16:44.766 --> 16:48.068
I thought he was
looking out for me.

16:48.127 --> 16:48.854
I guess I just...

16:48.889 --> 16:51.703
Wanted it to be true.

16:51.738 --> 16:52.754
(Weller)
Listen to me.

16:52.789 --> 16:54.375
The longer this
is out there,

16:54.442 --> 16:57.578
the more people are
gonna get hurt or die.

16:59.443 --> 17:02.399
We need your help
to get to Shawn Palmer.

17:05.086 --> 17:06.441
What do you need?

17:06.476 --> 17:08.358
Palmer's security firm
is a front.

17:08.393 --> 17:11.102
Outstanding warrants for
unauthorized computer access,

17:11.137 --> 17:13.411
wire fraud,
identity theft.

17:13.445 --> 17:15.326
And, ladies,
he is single.

17:15.361 --> 17:17.356
And invisible...
Cyber Division couldn't even

17:17.391 --> 17:18.958
find a photo, let alone
an address.

17:18.992 --> 17:20.435
I could find his username

17:20.470 --> 17:22.002
with DARPA's
Deep Web crawler,

17:22.037 --> 17:24.127
or track his Bitcoin usage
in the Blockchain.

17:24.190 --> 17:26.019
Or Ana could just
tell us where he lives.

17:26.054 --> 17:27.147
She's been to his house.

17:27.183 --> 17:29.234
Oh, sure, I mean, it's
a little analog, but...

17:29.269 --> 17:30.492
All right, let's go

17:30.527 --> 17:32.721
get Mr. Palmer and bring
him in for a chat.

17:32.756 --> 17:34.534
Wait, wait, wait, guys,
it's not that easy.

17:34.569 --> 17:37.229
Shawn's place is like this
crazy, fortified smart-home.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.914
He keeps his
servers there.

17:38.949 --> 17:40.650
The guy literally
never leaves.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.292
Fine, we break
down his door.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.629
No, a guy like Palmer
has an eject button.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.093
He sees law enforcement
coming, he's gonna take

17:46.161 --> 17:48.345
- the software open source.
- Open source?

17:48.380 --> 17:50.807
Meaning he'll put TRAKZER's
code online for free.

17:50.842 --> 17:52.415
This thing could go
viral in hours.

17:52.450 --> 17:54.804
Well, if we can't get in,
let's draw him out.

17:54.839 --> 17:56.870
What, like pull his
fire alarm or something?

17:56.905 --> 17:58.165
No.

17:58.219 --> 18:00.964
The guy is careful, smart
enough to know a false alarm.

18:00.999 --> 18:03.010
What if it wasn't
a false alarm?

18:05.410 --> 18:06.708
Reade, Zapata.

18:06.743 --> 18:08.185
<i>Are you in position?</i>

18:08.220 --> 18:09.719
(Zapata)
Ready when you are.

18:11.183 --> 18:13.007
(Weller)
<i>Patterson, what's our ETA?</i>

18:13.042 --> 18:13.993
I need a few more minutes.

18:14.028 --> 18:15.504
This guy has
a massive firewall.

18:15.539 --> 18:17.125
Blocked ports,
encrypted traffic,

18:17.160 --> 18:18.328
intrusion detection.

18:18.363 --> 18:19.744
Here, why don't you
try accessing...

18:19.779 --> 18:21.633
Don't touch
my keyboard!

18:21.668 --> 18:23.552
- Okay.
- You are a hacker.

18:23.587 --> 18:26.496
This computer is behind
the FBI firewall.

18:26.531 --> 18:28.103
No way you're
touching this, kid.

18:28.138 --> 18:29.300
Was just gonna suggest
entering through

18:29.335 --> 18:30.895
the emergency cell backup
on his smart-home control...

18:30.930 --> 18:33.104
Yes, and accessing his
cameras and the alarms.

18:33.139 --> 18:35.175
I was just gonna do that,
if you would just...

18:35.210 --> 18:36.320
let me type.

18:36.355 --> 18:37.699
Maybe if you were
writing in Python

18:37.734 --> 18:39.446
instead of Perl,
you'd move faster.

18:39.481 --> 18:41.092
- What's wrong with Perl?
- Nothing...

18:41.127 --> 18:43.216
if you're designing
a website in the late '90s.

18:43.251 --> 18:45.019
Whatever.

18:46.299 --> 18:47.285
I see you switching.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.687
I was gonna
switch anyway.

18:50.573 --> 18:53.559
You shouldn't have gone
in there with Ana.

18:53.594 --> 18:54.588
Why not?

18:54.623 --> 18:56.725
Because you shouldn't be
interrogating suspects.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.455
I was talking to her.

18:58.490 --> 19:00.290
And now, you're emotionally
invested in that girl.

19:00.325 --> 19:03.052
So, what if I am?
She is a scared, lonely kid.

19:03.087 --> 19:05.300
Who is the subject of
an investigation.

19:05.335 --> 19:08.304
FBI agents are trained
to maintain their distance.

19:08.339 --> 19:09.651
I'm not an FBI agent.

19:09.686 --> 19:11.531
And yet, you want
to be treated like one.

19:11.566 --> 19:12.976
You wanted a weapon,
so you got...

19:13.011 --> 19:14.590
Which you agreed to,

19:14.625 --> 19:15.783
because it was
too dangerous for me

19:15.850 --> 19:17.362
to be in the field
without one.

19:17.397 --> 19:19.151
What's changed
all of a sudden?

19:19.186 --> 19:22.168
In this job you have
to remain objective.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.358
Really?

19:24.426 --> 19:26.527
Is that what
you've done with me?

19:26.594 --> 19:28.996
Stayed objective?

19:29.064 --> 19:31.019
I'm working on it.

19:31.054 --> 19:31.998
(computers pinging)

19:32.077 --> 19:34.068
(Patterson) <i>Okay, you guys
should have eyes.</i>

19:34.135 --> 19:36.473
Now, I can shut off Shawn's
alarm and security systems,

19:36.508 --> 19:39.083
but the freeze is only gonna
last for about 90 seconds.

19:39.118 --> 19:40.374
That's all we need.

19:40.442 --> 19:42.112
Okay, Zapata,
you're up.

19:42.147 --> 19:45.267
<i>Look for a lever marked
"Primary Voltage Converter"</i>

19:45.302 --> 19:48.279
that controls the power
going into Shawn's place.

19:48.314 --> 19:49.726
All right, how high
do you want it?

19:49.761 --> 19:51.185
(chuckling)
As high as it goes.

19:51.252 --> 19:52.653
I like your style.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.254
(converter chirping)

19:54.322 --> 19:56.832
Okay, I've already
electronically jammed his fuses,

19:56.867 --> 20:00.427
and his wiring should
short out any second.

20:00.495 --> 20:02.629
(electronic music playing)

20:02.697 --> 20:05.199
â™ª

20:06.801 --> 20:08.836
Whoa, what the hell?

20:11.539 --> 20:13.033
(circuits exploding)

20:13.068 --> 20:14.411
No, no, no, no, no.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.761
Oh, my God,
this can't be happening.

20:20.822 --> 20:22.280
(typing)

20:22.315 --> 20:23.044
_

20:26.305 --> 20:28.140
(fire igniting)

20:31.593 --> 20:34.294
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

20:36.038 --> 20:37.511
(Patterson)
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

20:37.546 --> 20:40.079
Um, my place is on fire.
Send someone fast!

20:40.114 --> 20:41.135
<i>We have a truck in your area</i>

20:41.202 --> 20:43.040
<i>and we'll be there right away.
And, sir?</i>

20:43.075 --> 20:44.595
Please evacuate your home

20:44.630 --> 20:47.474
and get as far away
from the fire as possible.

20:47.542 --> 20:49.443
That was kinda cool.

20:49.511 --> 20:52.379
(typing)
Okay, get ready, guys.

20:52.414 --> 20:53.547
<i>He's coming out hot.</i>

20:56.296 --> 20:57.663
(Jane)
What is he doing?

20:57.698 --> 20:59.132
Trying to be a hero.

21:00.388 --> 21:02.890
(coughing)

21:05.493 --> 21:06.455
Come on.

21:06.490 --> 21:08.802
Get out.
Get out of there!

21:08.837 --> 21:10.471
- Oh, God.
- Let's move.

21:10.506 --> 21:11.806
We're going in.

21:15.534 --> 21:17.131
(grunting)

21:17.166 --> 21:18.467
Come on.

21:19.509 --> 21:21.076
(grunting)

21:27.007 --> 21:29.475
(coughing)

21:34.026 --> 21:35.016
(Patterson)
This is all that comes up

21:35.051 --> 21:37.578
when you try to use
Ana's software now.

21:37.613 --> 21:39.250
TRAKZER is dead.

21:39.285 --> 21:41.655
What about Shawn Palmer,
is he cooperating?

21:41.690 --> 21:43.379
Yeah, the nice thing about
arresting scumbags,

21:43.414 --> 21:45.306
they're not big on
honor among thieves.

21:45.341 --> 21:47.897
He's rolling over on every
Dark Web player we know of

21:47.932 --> 21:49.038
and some we don't.

21:49.073 --> 21:50.827
What happens to Ana now?

21:50.862 --> 21:52.646
Well, she thought
she was working for us

21:52.681 --> 21:55.333
and she cooperated when she
found out that she wasn't.

21:55.368 --> 21:58.132
So, as long as she stays out
of trouble during probation,

21:58.167 --> 21:59.352
she's free to go.

21:59.387 --> 22:01.509
This case felt different
than the others.

22:01.544 --> 22:03.982
Yeah, none of us almost
got killed for a change.

22:04.017 --> 22:06.713
But we've been dealing with
corruption so much lately,

22:06.748 --> 22:09.832
I was starting to think
the tattoos were from an enemy.

22:09.867 --> 22:12.368
Foreign spy agency,
something.

22:12.403 --> 22:14.232
But this time they
exposed technologies

22:14.267 --> 22:15.788
trying to harm
our agents,

22:15.823 --> 22:17.823
like they were
looking out for us.

22:17.858 --> 22:20.537
So, whoever did this to me
is trying to help?

22:20.572 --> 22:22.881
Or want us
to think they are.

22:26.370 --> 22:27.970
Hey.

22:28.030 --> 22:29.835
What has got
you twisted?

22:29.870 --> 22:31.526
That kid breaks the law,
profits from it,

22:31.561 --> 22:32.797
and gets a slap
on the wrist.

22:32.832 --> 22:34.490
She never made
any money off of it.

22:34.525 --> 22:36.013
We're supposed to take
her word for it?

22:36.048 --> 22:37.436
If she got
paid in Bitcoin,

22:37.471 --> 22:38.618
we'd never be able
to trace it,

22:38.653 --> 22:39.748
we'd never
know for sure.

22:39.783 --> 22:42.230
Come on.
Palmer was the get.

22:42.265 --> 22:43.442
Ana was in over her head.

22:43.477 --> 22:45.428
She's a 17-year-old kid,
on her own,

22:45.463 --> 22:47.427
just trying to use
her skills to survive.

22:47.495 --> 22:49.596
Dirty money
is dirty money.

22:53.327 --> 22:55.062
(Jane)
Shawn hurt a lot of people.

22:55.097 --> 22:57.520
And he probably would
have hurt a lot more

22:57.555 --> 23:00.056
if you didn't
help us catch him.

23:00.091 --> 23:02.466
You should feel good.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.028
I feel stupid.

23:04.063 --> 23:07.732
He was just the first person
in a long time who...

23:09.203 --> 23:11.486
Forget it.
(clears throat, sniffles)

23:13.967 --> 23:16.047
Do you want a ride home?

23:16.082 --> 23:17.413
I'm sure somebody
here could take...

23:17.448 --> 23:18.648
I'll be fine.

23:20.262 --> 23:22.396
Listen, if you...
if you want...

23:22.556 --> 23:25.825
if you ever want somebody
to grab a coffee with...

23:26.301 --> 23:27.817
I don't drink coffee.

23:27.872 --> 23:29.405
Right.

23:29.747 --> 23:32.814
I just mean, if you
ever wanna talk.

23:32.855 --> 23:34.556
Or we could
catch a movie.

23:34.634 --> 23:36.802
I can almost promise you
I won't have seen it.

23:42.244 --> 23:43.944
Maybe.

23:50.977 --> 23:52.344
Can I talk to you?

23:57.823 --> 23:59.824
Was I not clear before?

23:59.859 --> 24:02.095
That is not
how we do things.

24:03.404 --> 24:05.906
Well, maybe you
do things wrong.

24:05.973 --> 24:06.809
Ana didn't open up

24:06.844 --> 24:09.079
until I showed her
a little compassion.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.127
And her opening up
saved lives.

24:11.162 --> 24:12.729
The case is finished.

24:12.779 --> 24:14.709
And, what, you're
inviting her to a movie?

24:14.744 --> 24:16.973
She is completely
alone in this world,

24:17.008 --> 24:20.721
and she needs something in
her life other than her work.

24:22.100 --> 24:25.612
Jane...
Jane, if you ever

24:25.648 --> 24:26.880
wanna come and have
a drink with the team...

24:26.915 --> 24:28.916
No, I...

24:29.192 --> 24:30.390
It's a little
hard to relax

24:30.425 --> 24:33.174
when everybody at the table
has been staring at photos

24:33.209 --> 24:35.699
of your tattooed body
all day.

24:36.372 --> 24:37.538
What about Sarah?

24:37.573 --> 24:39.135
Your sister?

24:39.170 --> 24:41.842
Her last name
is on my back.

24:44.311 --> 24:47.657
Look, I appreciate everything
that you've done for me,

24:47.692 --> 24:48.989
everything that
you're doing.

24:49.024 --> 24:54.145
But I just...
I don't know, I...

24:54.281 --> 24:56.782
I need room to breathe.

25:06.302 --> 25:07.452
Hey.

25:07.487 --> 25:08.695
Do you have a minute?

25:08.730 --> 25:09.989
Sure.

25:10.024 --> 25:12.251
Uh, it's about
Saul Guerrero.

25:12.286 --> 25:14.147
His case number
is on Jane's body,

25:14.182 --> 25:15.870
and I've been digging
through his file,

25:15.905 --> 25:18.101
but it's pretty redacted.

25:18.136 --> 25:19.316
Talk to Mayfair.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.513
She'll get you
compartmentalized clearance.

25:21.548 --> 25:23.487
Uh, that's the thing.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.026
I did,
and she won't help.

25:26.061 --> 25:28.291
This is a pretty
big lead.

25:28.326 --> 25:31.571
Don't you think it's a little
weird not to follow it?

25:31.606 --> 25:33.292
I wouldn't read
into it too much.

25:33.327 --> 25:35.102
I just don't understand why
we're not following up on this.

25:35.137 --> 25:37.694
Fine, I'll look
into it, all right?

25:37.729 --> 25:40.593
If Mayfair says
there's nothing there,

25:40.628 --> 25:42.329
there's probably
nothing there.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.334
Okay.

26:05.792 --> 26:08.026
(gasping)

26:21.876 --> 26:24.145
- What do you want from me?
- Fix your app.

26:24.180 --> 26:25.540
The software's
too complicated, okay?

26:25.575 --> 26:26.745
That took me weeks
to code.

26:26.780 --> 26:29.251
We don't need
the whole thing.

26:29.286 --> 26:31.169
Just find this truck.

26:34.018 --> 26:35.518
You have an hour.

26:36.985 --> 26:38.498
That's not enough time.

26:38.533 --> 26:40.754
Can you find it
or not?

26:41.890 --> 26:44.725
I can find it.

26:44.793 --> 26:47.261
You're still at my place?

26:47.329 --> 26:49.233
What have you been
doing there all day?

26:49.272 --> 26:51.100
I cleaned.

26:51.139 --> 26:52.658
What do you mean,
you cleaned?

26:52.693 --> 26:54.200
You know, laundry, tidying.

26:54.235 --> 26:56.435
There may have been
a Swiffer involved.

26:56.470 --> 26:58.272
Did you touch
my board games?

26:58.340 --> 27:01.580
Yes.
I alphabetized them.

27:02.911 --> 27:05.330
Wait... they were
alphabetized,

27:05.365 --> 27:06.947
by game designer!

27:06.982 --> 27:07.981
<i>Oh.</i>

27:08.049 --> 27:10.351
Um... well, I think
I can remember...

27:10.418 --> 27:13.921
No, no, it... it... it's fine,
I'll just do it when I get home.

27:13.988 --> 27:16.816
<i>But the place does look
very nice, though.</i>

27:16.851 --> 27:18.659
(keyboard clacking)

27:18.727 --> 27:20.127
(buzz buzz)

27:21.396 --> 27:23.163
<i>What's wrong?</i>

27:23.231 --> 27:26.494
Someone is trying to access
the system with my login.

27:26.529 --> 27:27.627
I'm being hacked.

27:27.662 --> 27:29.521
Through your FBI firewall?

27:29.556 --> 27:31.205
Who... who's good enough
to do that?

27:32.574 --> 27:34.408
I think I know.

27:39.714 --> 27:42.008
Palmer said
you were fast.

27:42.043 --> 27:43.712
This is not fast.

27:43.747 --> 27:46.007
I'm going as
quick as I can.

27:46.042 --> 27:47.417
It sounds to me like
you articulated

27:47.452 --> 27:49.026
your desire for space.

27:49.061 --> 27:50.486
It didn't go very well.

27:50.521 --> 27:52.192
Well, setting boundaries
is challenging.

27:52.260 --> 27:53.887
Even in more conventional
relationships,

27:53.922 --> 27:56.320
people struggle to balance
intimacy and autonomy.

27:56.355 --> 27:57.442
You and Agent Weller
have an...

27:57.477 --> 28:00.200
Unconventional
relationship, yeah.

28:03.398 --> 28:05.390
You didn't tell Weller
what we talked about

28:05.425 --> 28:06.493
this morning, did you?

28:06.528 --> 28:08.912
Jane, our sessions
are confidential.

28:08.947 --> 28:12.613
Whatever you share,
it stays here.

28:12.842 --> 28:14.618
What makes you ask that?

28:14.653 --> 28:17.121
Because he's
pushing me away.

28:17.357 --> 28:20.387
And that upsets you?

28:21.514 --> 28:24.752
Perhaps Agent Weller is feeling
the same need for boundaries.

28:25.616 --> 28:26.817
(knocking on door)

28:28.062 --> 28:29.663
Sorry to interrupt.

28:29.714 --> 28:31.390
Patterson needs
to see us right now.

28:32.185 --> 28:33.500
She's not picking
up her cell.

28:33.568 --> 28:34.968
I think the hack
was an S.O.S.

28:35.036 --> 28:36.074
How do you know
it was her?

28:36.109 --> 28:37.979
The first half of the code
was written in Python

28:38.014 --> 28:40.087
and then it
switches to Perl.

28:40.122 --> 28:42.036
It's an inside joke.
It's her.

28:42.071 --> 28:44.083
So, where is she?
Can we track her location?

28:44.118 --> 28:47.440
Nope, her IP address is
routed through relay proxies.

28:47.475 --> 28:48.413
That's the only way
she could've hacked

28:48.448 --> 28:50.050
into our firewall.

28:50.365 --> 28:52.279
God, what's happening to her?

28:52.314 --> 28:53.981
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

28:58.689 --> 29:01.694
Got it!
This is live on Ana's webcam.

29:03.777 --> 29:05.506
Oh, God.

29:05.541 --> 29:06.894
All right,
the guy with the gun.

29:06.929 --> 29:09.682
Can you capture his face enough
to use recognition software?

29:12.484 --> 29:15.286
(computer beeping)

29:15.753 --> 29:17.821
Okay, Misha Volkov.

29:17.945 --> 29:20.380
Enforcer of the Petrovich
Heroin Syndicate.

29:20.415 --> 29:22.290
Russian drug runners.

29:22.325 --> 29:23.533
They must know that
she built TRAKZER

29:23.568 --> 29:25.120
and want to track
DEA movements.

29:25.155 --> 29:27.133
Which means they
need her alive.

29:27.168 --> 29:28.355
For now.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.151
That's Ana's apartment.

29:32.186 --> 29:33.961
Let's get Reade
and Zapata, we gotta move.

29:45.940 --> 29:46.931
- Clear.
- (Weller) Clear!

29:46.966 --> 29:49.034
- Clear.
- Clear.

29:49.069 --> 29:51.321
We must have
just missed them.

29:51.356 --> 29:52.679
Hey, can you get
on this computer,

29:52.747 --> 29:53.589
find out what
she was tracking?

29:53.624 --> 29:55.449
Yeah, I can try.

29:55.517 --> 29:57.451
One more time.

29:59.376 --> 30:00.576
(keyboard clacking)

30:01.953 --> 30:02.588
_

30:02.623 --> 30:04.753
Wait, the username.

30:04.788 --> 30:06.560
Is that Ana trying to
leave us a code?

30:06.628 --> 30:09.930
No, that's a VIN number.

30:09.998 --> 30:11.732
She's showing us what
they're tracking.

30:11.799 --> 30:13.834
And how to find her.

30:14.909 --> 30:17.200
These guys are always
late for the transfers.

30:22.857 --> 30:23.757
(knocking)

30:23.871 --> 30:25.471
Finally.

30:26.581 --> 30:27.480
- (gunshot)
- Uhh!

30:27.515 --> 30:28.719
(whimpers)

30:28.917 --> 30:29.788
(gunshot)

30:29.823 --> 30:31.157
Agh!

30:31.614 --> 30:32.552
(groaning)

30:32.587 --> 30:34.288
(sobbing)

30:38.754 --> 30:39.826
(gunshot)

30:40.033 --> 30:41.400
(sobbing)

30:48.036 --> 30:49.713
(siren bloops)

30:49.748 --> 30:51.914
That was Patterson.
The VIN belongs

30:51.949 --> 30:54.872
to an unmarked Homeland Security
transport truck.

30:54.907 --> 30:57.314
It's carrying weapons on
the way to get shipped aboard.

30:57.349 --> 30:58.323
That's a massive arsenal.

30:58.358 --> 31:00.145
We can't let that
fall into their hands.

31:00.180 --> 31:01.947
Any word from
the drivers?

31:01.982 --> 31:03.784
DHS lost contact.

31:11.230 --> 31:12.397
_

31:12.432 --> 31:14.162
_

31:27.261 --> 31:30.130
â™ª

31:30.481 --> 31:32.982
It's all right.
We're gonna find her.

31:33.050 --> 31:34.661
I know you think
I'm too invested.

31:34.696 --> 31:38.121
We're all invested now.
Let's get her safe.

31:51.100 --> 31:53.130
_

31:54.905 --> 31:58.141
(truck beeping)

31:58.415 --> 31:59.975
_

32:18.495 --> 32:20.396
(whistles)

32:20.464 --> 32:23.065
(siren blaring)

32:32.835 --> 32:36.672
(gunfire)

32:40.984 --> 32:42.718
(Weller)
R.P.G.! Move!

32:51.061 --> 32:53.830
(high-pitched ringing)

32:56.321 --> 32:57.494
Do you see Ana?

32:57.552 --> 32:59.720
No, no sign of her.

32:59.937 --> 33:01.904
(grunts)

33:05.562 --> 33:07.897
(man)
Get the girl!

33:08.011 --> 33:10.546
(gunfire continues)

33:14.918 --> 33:16.485
(muffled grunting)

33:16.553 --> 33:18.654
There.
Cover me!

33:18.689 --> 33:19.550
What?!

33:19.585 --> 33:21.125
Cover me!

33:22.281 --> 33:23.882
(gunfire)

33:25.929 --> 33:27.296
Go.

33:37.559 --> 33:39.059
Uhh!

33:42.850 --> 33:44.841
- (grunting)
- Uhh!

33:46.461 --> 33:48.712
Come on, come here.

33:48.747 --> 33:50.086
You're okay.

33:51.574 --> 33:52.640
(Reade groaning)

33:55.263 --> 33:57.064
Gah!

33:58.619 --> 33:59.819
(gun firing)

34:15.297 --> 34:16.364
Aah!

34:16.417 --> 34:18.918
(truck starting up)

34:19.335 --> 34:20.844
He's getting away!

34:28.384 --> 34:30.085
- Whoa!
- Aah!

34:50.114 --> 34:51.447
Thank you.

34:56.098 --> 34:57.398
Did the medic
clear you?

34:57.433 --> 34:58.746
Yeah, yeah, just, uh...

34:58.781 --> 35:01.924
(clears throat)
...a couple bruises.

35:03.160 --> 35:07.179
Thanks for...
coming to get me.

35:07.214 --> 35:09.131
You're welcome.

35:10.535 --> 35:12.301
So, what's next?

35:12.336 --> 35:14.357
They're going to,
uh, keep you

35:14.392 --> 35:17.842
under protective custody
for a while, just to be safe.

35:21.812 --> 35:23.746
It's not that bad.

35:26.235 --> 35:29.123
You don't know what any of
your tattoos mean, do you?

35:29.964 --> 35:32.379
(sighs)
We're working on it.

35:33.332 --> 35:36.012
Figure out that
steganography yet?

35:36.047 --> 35:37.009
What?

35:37.044 --> 35:39.962
The black square
on your shoulder.

35:40.030 --> 35:43.065
Steganography?

35:45.335 --> 35:47.064
(Patterson)
Steganography, of course.

35:47.099 --> 35:48.537
Can you fill
the rest of us in?

35:48.605 --> 35:50.596
It's a... a method
of concealing messages

35:50.631 --> 35:52.066
in innocuous images.

35:52.101 --> 35:54.768
It's used by spy services,
terrorists...

35:54.803 --> 35:56.145
it dates back to
the Ancient Greeks.

35:56.213 --> 35:57.329
So the black isn't
just covering

35:57.364 --> 35:59.248
the Navy SEAL
tattoo underneath.

35:59.316 --> 36:01.456
Oh, well, that's the thing,
it's not all black.

36:01.491 --> 36:02.547
Some of it's off-black.

36:02.582 --> 36:05.023
So, uh, if you
isolate those sections

36:05.058 --> 36:07.683
and change their
values to white...

36:11.260 --> 36:12.193
(gasps)

36:12.237 --> 36:15.831
The mask isn't covering
the message.

36:16.013 --> 36:18.247
The mask <i>is</i> the message.

36:27.627 --> 36:29.651
It's a classic
puzzle trick.

36:29.686 --> 36:32.077
The dead space
is always a clue.

36:32.112 --> 36:33.668
Do you know
what it means yet?

36:33.703 --> 36:36.138
I mean, it looks
like a turtle shell,

36:36.173 --> 36:37.577
but that's not
very helpful.

36:37.612 --> 36:40.123
I mean, maybe it's a...
a substitution cipher

36:40.158 --> 36:41.203
using grid fragments,

36:41.238 --> 36:44.430
but that could take days
to decode, or longer.

36:44.465 --> 36:45.546
So, no?

36:45.581 --> 36:46.658
Not yet.

36:46.726 --> 36:47.847
But we're on it.

36:47.882 --> 36:49.433
You're saying every
one of these tattoos

36:49.468 --> 36:50.881
could have
a double meaning?

36:50.916 --> 36:53.265
Or triple.
Or more.

36:54.268 --> 36:55.677
We should go back
over every tattoo

36:55.712 --> 36:57.526
that we've already
decoded.

36:57.561 --> 36:59.955
I mean, the CDC symbol,
the drone pilot's name,

36:59.990 --> 37:02.733
even my name on Jane's back.
Nothing's dead.

37:02.768 --> 37:05.036
Any of them can
hold another clue.

37:14.821 --> 37:17.422
(clears throat)
Thanks.

37:23.844 --> 37:26.210
Do you want
a new lead agent?

37:26.245 --> 37:28.673
- What?
- On your case.

37:28.708 --> 37:30.503
Back in
the surveillance van,

37:30.538 --> 37:35.203
you said...
I wasn't objective.

37:35.238 --> 37:37.136
So I can step down.

37:37.171 --> 37:41.481
Mayfair can assign you
a new lead agent.

37:41.516 --> 37:43.076
I shouldn't have
said that.

37:43.111 --> 37:44.545
I was upset.

37:47.172 --> 37:49.141
You might be right.

37:50.519 --> 37:54.059
Maybe there's too much
baggage between us.

37:55.757 --> 37:58.312
Or maybe the baggage
is what makes you

37:58.347 --> 38:00.107
the right guy
for the job.

38:00.142 --> 38:02.701
Who else
is more invested?

38:11.370 --> 38:13.213
Do you want me
to give you a lift home?

38:13.248 --> 38:15.961
My security detail's
downstairs.

38:15.996 --> 38:19.884
It's no big deal.
It is on my way home.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.753
Better not.

38:25.925 --> 38:27.434
Good night.

38:27.469 --> 38:28.855
Hey, I was gonna catch
the end of the Knicks game

38:28.890 --> 38:30.675
down at 1849,
you wanna come?

38:30.738 --> 38:33.222
- Mmm... next time.
- You sure?

38:33.257 --> 38:35.199
Never seen you
turn down 20-cent wings.

38:35.234 --> 38:39.242
Yeah, I think I'm
just gonna crash.

38:39.277 --> 38:41.822
You know, if something's up,
you can talk to me, right?

38:44.185 --> 38:46.942
Do you need to talk?

38:46.977 --> 38:48.979
Is that what
this is about?

38:49.014 --> 38:50.382
Good night, Tasha.

38:51.364 --> 38:52.751
Good night.

39:02.656 --> 39:03.656
(locker closes)

39:07.979 --> 39:09.167
Kurt...

39:17.871 --> 39:19.467
I told you
I wanted him gone.

39:19.502 --> 39:21.185
Son...

39:21.220 --> 39:24.322
Just sit down
for one minute.

39:24.357 --> 39:26.151
He needs to hear it
from the both of us.

39:26.219 --> 39:28.353
Hear what?

39:31.491 --> 39:33.652
You haven't told him
about Jane, have you?

39:33.687 --> 39:35.827
Who's Jane?

39:35.895 --> 39:37.629
What's going on?

39:38.026 --> 39:39.698
Just sit down.

39:40.198 --> 39:41.779
Please.

39:43.572 --> 39:45.651
Where'd you find this
kind of stack in 12 hours?

39:45.686 --> 39:47.126
Couch cushions.

39:47.161 --> 39:48.241
Giants are laying
six on Sunday.

39:48.276 --> 39:50.409
Which way you leaning?

39:50.723 --> 39:52.244
Out.

39:52.462 --> 39:54.283
I'm out, Randy.

39:54.318 --> 39:55.871
Yeah, I heard
that song before.

39:55.906 --> 39:57.873
Not from me.

40:01.003 --> 40:02.870
I'll see you soon, Tash.

40:18.071 --> 40:21.453
They still don't know
what happened to her,

40:21.488 --> 40:23.626
or who took her,
or where she went

40:23.661 --> 40:24.960
or how sh...
how she got back.

40:24.995 --> 40:27.738
But they did
the DNA tests.

40:29.635 --> 40:31.716
And it's definitely her.

40:38.965 --> 40:41.099
Dad, Taylor's alive.

40:46.530 --> 40:48.499
(sobbing)

40:48.698 --> 40:50.116
She is.

41:07.153 --> 41:09.988
â™ª

41:19.312 --> 41:20.942
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

41:22.368 --> 41:26.850
Um... do you guys want
to go out somewhere?

41:26.885 --> 41:29.263
Grab a beer, maybe?

41:29.298 --> 41:30.944
Sorry, ma'am, we're not
permitted to take you

41:30.979 --> 41:33.297
to an unsecured location.

41:33.332 --> 41:37.122
Right, um, well, what about
coming in for a drink?

41:37.157 --> 41:39.391
- Just one.
- Sorry, ma'am.

41:39.426 --> 41:42.542
But we can have a bottle
sent up if you'd like.

41:42.577 --> 41:46.958
No, that's, um...
thanks anyway.
