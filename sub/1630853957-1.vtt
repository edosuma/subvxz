-If he were here today,

23:54.084 --> 23:55.782
there's no way the collection
plate would look so light.

23:55.825 --> 23:58.698
Psst. Give money, Joseph.
You're embarrassing me.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.482
He's embarrassing me.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.140
HILDO:
40 dollars?

24:06.183 --> 24:07.489
Thank you, Joseph.

24:07.533 --> 24:10.318
I see you value my sermon
as much as my music.

24:10.361 --> 24:11.972
I'm sorry, Father Hildo.

24:12.015 --> 24:16.367
Look, if you think it's so easy,
why don't you come up and do it?

24:16.411 --> 24:17.630
You have a lot to say.

24:17.673 --> 24:18.935
You know how
to entertain a crowd.

24:18.979 --> 24:20.197
Come on, brothers and sisters.

24:20.241 --> 24:21.634
Wouldn't you like to hear
Joe Valencia

24:21.677 --> 24:23.374
from those annoying
beer commercials

24:23.418 --> 24:25.507
-come up and give us a word?
-[congregation cheering]

24:25.551 --> 24:27.291
What?

24:27.335 --> 24:28.641
Come on, Joe.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.428
WOMAN:
Joe Valencia!

24:33.472 --> 24:35.212
Yeah.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.175
Hello.

24:41.218 --> 24:44.221
It's good to be home for Easter,

24:44.265 --> 24:46.223
among family, and, um...

24:46.267 --> 24:50.010
And-and today,
it's important to remember,

24:50.053 --> 24:51.533
no matter our differences,

24:51.577 --> 24:55.102
Easter is a time
for us to come together.

24:55.145 --> 24:57.321
-[chuckles]
-[microphone feedback hums]

24:57.365 --> 24:58.758
I mean, who are we kidding?

24:58.801 --> 25:00.499
It actually feels like
the time for us

25:00.542 --> 25:01.935
to be at each other's throats.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.719
It's the time to hold grudges.

25:03.763 --> 25:05.068
It's a, it's a time

25:05.112 --> 25:07.462
to-to complain about
each other's food.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.682
I mean, show of hands,

25:09.725 --> 25:14.034
how many people here have titas
that are fighting today?

25:14.077 --> 25:16.732
Come on. Stop lying.

25:16.776 --> 25:18.604
You're in church. Exactly.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.823
-Stop it. [mutters]
-That's what I'm talking about.

25:20.867 --> 25:24.523
Father Hildo's up here talking
about "family is divine."

25:24.566 --> 25:26.960
Well, I say family is a mess.

25:27.003 --> 25:28.657
A complete mess.

25:28.701 --> 25:32.356
I mean, no wonder no one wants
to come home for the holidays

25:32.400 --> 25:34.054
to their Filipino parents.

25:34.097 --> 25:35.708
They don't.

25:35.751 --> 25:39.494
If there was ever a question
if Jesus Christ was Filipino,

25:39.538 --> 25:41.583
his dad straight-up
guilt-tripped him

25:41.627 --> 25:43.106
-to come home for Easter.
-[laughter]

25:43.150 --> 25:45.195
It's the truth.

25:45.239 --> 25:47.197
[Filipino accent]:
"Jesus, are you coming

25:47.241 --> 25:49.025
"back home for Easter?

25:49.069 --> 25:53.421
I'm by myself in heaven, and
it's very lonely." [chuckles]

25:53.464 --> 25:55.510
[normal voice]: And Jesus
is like, "Ah, Dad, I'm busy.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.817
"I'm-- All day, I've been
turning water into wine,

25:57.860 --> 25:59.906
"and-and the Romans,
they scare me.

25:59.949 --> 26:01.081
"I've been running away.

26:01.124 --> 26:02.430
-[laughter]
-"Uh, by the way,

26:02.473 --> 26:04.606
"I got 12 friends
coming over for dinner.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.652
-I don't have time."
-[laughter]

26:06.695 --> 26:08.567
And God's like,
"Okay, fine, Jesus.

26:08.610 --> 26:11.134
"Go ahead and have fun
with your friends.

26:11.178 --> 26:14.268
"But one--
watch out for one of them.

26:14.311 --> 26:15.574
"He's not good.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.227
"He might stab you in the back.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.751
[laughter]

26:18.794 --> 26:20.840
"He might just
sneak up behind you

26:20.883 --> 26:23.756
"and-and just
stab you like that.

26:23.799 --> 26:26.541
"And you're, [groans] 'I'm--
I was already going to die

26:26.585 --> 26:29.022
"for my sins,
but why did you do that to me?'

26:29.065 --> 26:30.458
[laughter]

26:30.501 --> 26:32.329
"Just put spoons on the table.

26:32.373 --> 26:33.635
[laughter]

26:33.679 --> 26:35.289
"'Cause if he stab you
with the spoon--

26:35.332 --> 26:36.638
"'Hey. What are you doing?'

26:36.682 --> 26:38.597
"But if he has a knife--

[laughter]

26:40.207 --> 26:41.904
"Sp-- He's spooning you, huh?

26:41.948 --> 26:44.907
"He just keeps spooning
and spooning like that.

26:44.951 --> 26:46.169
[laughter continues]

26:46.213 --> 26:48.171
"You're not a dessert.

26:48.215 --> 26:49.738
"You're my son.

26:49.782 --> 26:52.045
"You are my son,
and the last thing I want to see

26:52.088 --> 26:54.134
"is someone spooning my son.

26:54.177 --> 26:56.005
[laughter]

26:56.049 --> 26:57.964
So just come home, Anak."

26:58.007 --> 26:59.922
[laughter, applause]

26:59.966 --> 27:01.750
I'm guilty of it, too.

27:01.794 --> 27:04.144
I guilt-tripped my son
into coming home

27:04.187 --> 27:05.711
for Easter here,
to see the family.

27:05.754 --> 27:08.496
He doesn't want to be here.
He'd rather be home.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.933
Kids got it easy.
Am I right, Father Hildo?

27:10.977 --> 27:12.848
They got it so easy.

27:12.892 --> 27:15.895
I mean, look at that picture
of Jesus right there.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.766
Jesus died for our sins.

27:17.810 --> 27:20.639
My son dies when I take
his phone away for two hours.

27:20.682 --> 27:21.596
[laughter]

27:21.640 --> 27:23.206
He doesn't know what to do.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.818
He just walks around the house
like he's been crucified.

27:25.861 --> 27:28.081
-"What did I do to
deserve this, Dad? -[laughter]

27:28.124 --> 27:30.126
"I need my phone back, Dad!

27:30.170 --> 27:31.301
[laughter]

27:31.345 --> 27:32.868
"I need Spotify.

27:32.912 --> 27:34.653
"I ordered Uber Eats!

27:34.696 --> 27:36.785
I want to go on Instagram!"

27:36.829 --> 27:38.395
[laughter, applause]

27:38.439 --> 27:39.658
But I'm joking.

27:39.701 --> 27:42.356
I'm happy I'm home
to see my mom.

27:42.399 --> 27:43.923
I really am.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.707
But, God, you make it difficult.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.404
You really do.

27:47.448 --> 27:50.843
My mom is at war
with my Tita Teresa,

27:50.886 --> 27:52.845
and none of us know why.

27:52.888 --> 27:55.978
If you didn't know if they were
related, look at their dresses.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.197
[laughter]

27:57.240 --> 27:58.720
Both of them
got it at Marshalls.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.983
[Filipino accent]:
They call that a "two for one."

28:01.027 --> 28:02.332
[laughter]

28:02.376 --> 28:03.856
[normal voice]:
So I think, right now,

28:03.899 --> 28:08.077
especially today, I think
they should bury the hatchet.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.079
-Yes!
-[congregation cheering]

28:10.123 --> 28:12.386
-JOE: Right? Bury the hatchet!
-That's right.

28:12.429 --> 28:17.217
What do you think, Daly City?
What do you think, Daly City?

28:17.260 --> 28:21.874
Should my mom and Tita Teresa
just drop the grudge for one day

28:21.917 --> 28:24.398
so that we can have
a beautiful Easter lunch?

28:24.441 --> 28:25.616
-What do you say?
-[congregation cheering]

28:25.660 --> 28:27.618
-Stop it. Stop it.
-Yes!

28:27.662 --> 28:30.665
Now reach into your pocket
and grab your wallet

28:30.709 --> 28:32.406
and put some more money
in that basket!

28:32.449 --> 28:37.193
And if you have extra money,
please buy Father Hildo's demo!

Mine was to stop wearing shorts
with my postal carrier uniform.

I have varicose veins.

shorts are too casual.

What are you
talking about, Nick?

30:53.939 --> 30:55.375
The character

Not left a dinner
or missed a school play,

I told you it was a bad weekend,

but you just kept calling
and calling and calling.

It's Easter Sunday, Joseph.

And the guilt.

-No, I thought you got that.
-JOE: No.

1:12:49.495 --> 1:12:52.237
So that's why I was trying
to get to L.A., to salvage it.

1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:54.326
You lied to us, Joseph?

1:12:54.370 --> 1:12:57.764
I'm just trying to do
the best that I can, Mom.

1:12:57.808 --> 1:13:00.332
Well, I don't know anything
about the acting thing,

1:13:00.376 --> 1:13:04.945
but with all due respect, Tita
Susan, Joe's a great father.

1:13:06.164 --> 1:13:07.600
And you're a great mother.

1:13:08.819 --> 1:13:11.256
I don't know why you keep
saying that you're not.

1:13:11.299 --> 1:13:14.607
Because that's what
she keeps telling me.

1:13:14.651 --> 1:13:16.304
Tita Teresa,

1:13:16.348 --> 1:13:18.829
did you tell my mom
that she's a terrible mother?

1:13:18.872 --> 1:13:21.222
-No.
-SUSAN: Yes, you did.

1:13:21.266 --> 1:13:23.442
-On the cruise.
-I simply told you

1:13:23.486 --> 1:13:25.879
that you push him so hard,
that's why he moved to L.A.

1:13:25.923 --> 1:13:27.315
Did I push you too hard?

1:13:27.359 --> 1:13:30.057
Yeah, but that's
what made me who I am.

1:13:30.101 --> 1:13:31.145
Then what about the bike?

1:13:31.189 --> 1:13:33.539
That was 35 years ago. I'm okay.

1:13:33.583 --> 1:13:36.586
-I am sorry about the bike.
-[sighs]

1:13:36.629 --> 1:13:38.631
I knew you were hurt,
and I kept yelling,

1:13:38.675 --> 1:13:40.807
"Get back on the bike!
Get back on the bike!"

1:13:41.852 --> 1:13:44.376
We'd just come to this country,
and I wanted you to fit in.

1:13:44.420 --> 1:13:48.641
All the kids
already knew how to ride.

1:13:48.685 --> 1:13:50.382
And your dad was gone.

1:13:51.252 --> 1:13:54.081
And I just wanted to make sure

1:13:54.125 --> 1:13:56.475
that you could catch up to them.

1:13:56.519 --> 1:14:00.044
Mom, I did catch up
to those kids.

1:14:00.087 --> 1:14:03.003
Want to know why?
'Cause I'm strong.

1:14:03.047 --> 1:14:04.527
Because of you.

1:14:05.615 --> 1:14:08.487
And when Dad left,
you were alone.

1:14:08.531 --> 1:14:11.272
You know? And you-you had
to do whatever you could

1:14:11.316 --> 1:14:12.970
to teach me
how to ride that bike.

1:14:13.013 --> 1:14:14.754
You were the only one
that cared, Mom.

1:14:15.538 --> 1:14:18.541
So you're not angry
about the bike?

1:14:18.584 --> 1:14:20.978

for that.
