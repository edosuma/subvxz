WEBVTT

00:12.577 --> 00:12.751
.

00:12.795 --> 00:15.102
- If you were going to move
to another country,

00:15.145 --> 00:18.279
you wouldn't tell me
at a party, right?

00:18.322 --> 00:20.455
- You still upset?

00:20.498 --> 00:21.891
- Not that they're together.

00:21.934 --> 00:24.850
I mean, that part could not
have taken any longer.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.026
But moving to London?

00:26.069 --> 00:28.071
- What about the hospital?

00:28.115 --> 00:31.031
Max is the glue.
He holds us together.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.815
- New Amsterdam survived
before him.

00:32.858 --> 00:35.687
It'll survive after him.

00:35.731 --> 00:39.865
Plus, they have
a new deputy chair of surgery

00:39.909 --> 00:42.868
who's kicking ass.

00:42.912 --> 00:44.870
- You know he was the first
person there to believe in me?

00:44.914 --> 00:48.700
- You know, I've never said
this out loud before, but...

00:48.744 --> 00:52.182
he's kind of my hero.

00:52.226 --> 00:58.101
- He's not dying.
- Feels like he is.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.103
And Helen--
- She was always there

01:00.147 --> 01:02.149
whenever I needed a friend.

01:02.192 --> 01:04.716
- First Vijay, now this?
What's next, Gladys?

01:04.760 --> 01:07.328
It's oh--God, I can't
even--that's not--

01:07.371 --> 01:09.373
It's too much, too fast.

01:09.417 --> 01:10.766
- What if the new
medical director goes back

01:10.809 --> 01:12.202
to the way it was?
I mean, do I quit?

01:12.246 --> 01:14.248
I just--I don't know.

01:16.815 --> 01:19.905
- Stop talking.

01:19.949 --> 01:22.082
- Yes, ma'am.

01:25.737 --> 01:28.088
- I think I can help.

01:32.353 --> 01:35.791
- How am I gonna survive
five days without you?

01:35.834 --> 01:37.923
- Relax.

01:37.967 --> 01:41.492
They don't need your anxiety,
they need your support.

01:41.536 --> 01:45.670
Just be happy for them.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.891
- Yeah.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.285
Yeah.

01:51.328 --> 01:52.503
Why should they be
the only ones having

01:52.547 --> 01:55.724
exciting new sex, right?
- Right.

01:59.510 --> 02:02.383
<i>- This is the morning song!
Sing along. Come on. </i>

02:02.426 --> 02:05.995
- It's Miss Abigail.
- But is she in the apartment?

02:06.038 --> 02:07.997
- Just on YouTube.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.913
I think we're fine.
I think we have five minutes.

02:10.956 --> 02:14.438
<i>- Let's get this day started
with today is-- </i>

02:14.482 --> 02:17.441
- Waffle, waffle, waffle.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.269
- Oh, dear God.
- One sec.

02:19.313 --> 02:25.449
- Waffle, waffle, waffle.

02:25.493 --> 02:28.235
- You want waffles?
Who wants waffles?

02:28.278 --> 02:29.888
- Me.
- You do?

02:29.932 --> 02:31.716
Do you want extra gooey syrup?

02:31.760 --> 02:34.371
I think so.
Let's get some.

02:53.825 --> 02:56.741
- Looking for the six?
- I'm--I'm sorry, what?

02:56.785 --> 02:59.179
- It's all good.
Tourists always get confused,

02:59.222 --> 03:00.310
but this isn't
a subway entrance.

03:00.354 --> 03:03.357
It's actually a hospital.
- You don't say.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.054
- Guessing you already
knew that.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.621
- Well, it was the hundreds of
people walking around in scrubs

03:06.664 --> 03:08.144
that kind of tipped me off.

03:08.188 --> 03:12.192
Do you happen to know where
there's a Dr. Max Goodwin?

03:12.235 --> 03:13.845
- You know what?
He's off campus today.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.499
But I can take you up
to his assistant.

03:15.543 --> 03:19.503
- Oh no need.
No need, Dr.?

03:19.547 --> 03:21.853
- Reynolds.
- Dr. Reynolds.

03:21.897 --> 03:25.509
Besides, I think it best that
Max not be here for this.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.733
- Welcome to the NovaCo
Five-Borough Science Fair.

03:33.778 --> 03:36.520
I'm Ron Elgin, chief
advancement officer for NovaCo.

03:36.564 --> 03:39.523
And I'd like to introduce
our judge for the festivities.

03:39.567 --> 03:42.570
Let's give a warm welcome
to Dr. Max Goodwin.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.311
- Thank you guys.

03:44.354 --> 03:45.877
Thanks for having me.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.663
Thank you to Ron and to NovaCo
for putting this together.

03:48.706 --> 03:49.968
This is amazing.

03:50.012 --> 03:52.710
When I was your age,
I built a can crusher

03:52.754 --> 03:55.670
for my science fair,
and it was not the coolest.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.499
I didn't win, but it did crush
cans like nobody's business.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.370
So I'm very excited to see

04:00.414 --> 04:02.546
what neat things you guys
have come up with.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.722
Let's judge.

04:04.766 --> 04:06.463
- It's about automated
segmentation

04:06.507 --> 04:09.292
for color quantification
in African cichlid fish.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.511
- Interesting.

04:10.554 --> 04:11.990
should I still be the judge

04:12.034 --> 04:13.818
if the only word I got
there was fish?

04:13.862 --> 04:15.298
- I got a college lab
to let me use

04:15.342 --> 04:19.128
their 3-D printer for accuracy.
- Oh. Good for you.

04:19.171 --> 04:23.001
Looks expensive. Sorry.

04:23.045 --> 04:25.308
Wow, even the old volcano guy
is crushing it.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.354
This is amazing.
Smoke and everything.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.660
Even dinosaurs. Very cool.

04:29.704 --> 04:31.271
- Picking a winner
won't be easy.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.621
- Yeah, what about
a 14-way tie?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.798
Is that a turnip?

04:38.800 --> 04:42.325
- I grew it myself.
- Not the flashiest entry.

04:42.369 --> 04:44.675
- You'll change your mind when
I tell you how this turnip's

04:44.719 --> 04:47.330
gonna fix the world.
- Okay.

04:47.374 --> 04:50.072
Imani Moore, bring it on.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.987
- So this is a smart suture.

04:52.030 --> 04:54.119
It's what most
American hospitals use.

04:54.163 --> 04:56.774
It's coated with sensors that
are like tiny thermometers.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.298
Infection raises temperature,

04:58.341 --> 04:59.734
so when your wound's heat
goes up,

04:59.777 --> 05:01.692
it uses smartphone technology
to alert your doctor.

05:01.736 --> 05:02.606
- We have these
at our hospital.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.173
They're super cool, right?

05:04.216 --> 05:05.435
- Unless you live
in a place where

05:05.479 --> 05:06.784
your doctors can't afford
smartphones.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.699
Then the smart suture's
a dumb piece of thread

05:08.743 --> 05:10.614
that knows you might die
but can't tell anybody.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.660
- Yeah, that does seem
less cool now.

05:12.703 --> 05:15.358
- Suture number two:
no sensors, no thermometers.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.578
Made from a common turnip.
And it knows

05:17.621 --> 05:19.928
if you have an infection
just as fast as the fancy one.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.104
Infection doesn't just change
a wound's temperature.

05:22.147 --> 05:24.672
It also changes its pH.
And the natural pH level

05:24.715 --> 05:26.021
of a turnip-infused suture

05:26.064 --> 05:27.849
will, upon infection,
change color.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.633
So when it does,
you go to the doctor.

05:29.677 --> 05:31.374
See, smart sutures need phones,
high-speed Internet,

05:31.418 --> 05:34.551
1,800 microscopic thermometers.
I just need a root vegetable.

05:34.595 --> 05:38.250
- Imani, this could save lives.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.165
How did you come up with this?

05:40.209 --> 05:42.516
- I'm a first generation
immigrant, Dr. Goodwin.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.692
Surgical site infections
in impoverished countries

05:44.735 --> 05:46.694
are nine times higher
than in America.

05:46.737 --> 05:49.740
That's some ripe you-know-what,
so I'm gonna fix it.

05:49.784 --> 05:52.787
P.S., if I win, I plan to use
the prize money to help pay

05:52.830 --> 05:54.266
for Banneker Medical School,

05:54.310 --> 05:56.530
which would get me a big step
closer to my goal.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.358
- And what is that?

05:58.401 --> 06:00.447
- Like I said,
I'm gonna fix the world.

06:00.490 --> 06:04.059
- Oh.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.461
- Any new life-changing
announcements

06:14.504 --> 06:17.159
I should brace myself for?
- Mm-hmm.

06:17.202 --> 06:21.163
Yeah, I just spent
my first full night at Max's.

06:21.206 --> 06:22.730
And it was eye-opening.

06:22.773 --> 06:25.385
- Okay, if you think I can be
bought off

06:25.428 --> 06:26.864
by salacious gossip...

06:26.908 --> 06:28.518
- The man snores.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.955
I'm on, like,
zero sleep right now.

06:30.999 --> 06:33.741
It's not just the snoring.
He's messy.

06:33.784 --> 06:37.571
He's really messy.
Like, Luna is the clean one.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.921
And he's disorganized.
His place is cramped.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.879
My closet is bigger
than his entire apartment.

06:41.923 --> 06:44.012
- But to be fair, your closet--
it's amazing.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.709
- And to top it all off,
he was out of toilet paper.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.972
I mean, is this my life now?
My God.

06:48.016 --> 06:52.716
- At least you're not freaking
out about the little things.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.675
- I was so busy falling
in love,

06:54.718 --> 06:55.676
I forgot that being
together

06:55.719 --> 06:57.417
actually meant living together.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.636
- Maybe you should dump him.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.943
At least then we get to keep
at least one of you.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.163
It's just a thought.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.341
- Here is your medal
for first place.

07:09.385 --> 07:14.782
And perhaps better yet,
your check for $50,000.

07:14.825 --> 07:16.523
- I can't believe this
is happening.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.572
- It's about to get better.
Follow me.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.966
Ron, I'd like
to introduce you

07:25.009 --> 07:27.490
to the future,
Miss Imani Moore.

07:27.534 --> 07:28.970
- Great project.
Congratulations.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.885
- Thank you.
- And because NovaCo's

07:30.928 --> 07:34.279
underwriting all of this, they
can make your idea a reality.

07:34.323 --> 07:35.977
And New Amsterdam wants in.
We'd like to preorder

07:36.020 --> 07:39.371
$35,000 worth.
How does that sound?

07:39.415 --> 07:42.592
- I gotta call my parents.

07:42.636 --> 07:45.073
- Max, NovaCo already produces

07:45.116 --> 07:46.944
a chemically based
smart suture.

07:46.988 --> 07:48.250
- Yeah, but this is totally
different.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.773
I mean, it uses turnips.

07:49.817 --> 07:52.297
- And after all of the R&D
that went into our sutures,

07:52.341 --> 07:55.736
they'll never cannibalize those
margins with a similar product.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.959
- But you own her concept.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.874
So what are you going
to do with her research?

08:03.918 --> 08:07.138
- To be honest?
Shelve it.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.618
- Shelve it?

08:08.662 --> 08:11.316
- She still won, Max.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.450
It's a great honor.
She should be very proud.

08:24.852 --> 08:27.289
- Dr. Wandy Agliar
in the house.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.378
Look out now.
- Are you always this peppy?

08:29.421 --> 08:30.597
- Yes, I am.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.381
What are you gonna do about it,
huh?

08:32.424 --> 08:34.252
So how's
my star resident today?

08:34.296 --> 08:35.993
What--what are you doing?
You out there mending hearts?

08:36.037 --> 08:38.126
Changing lives?
- Actually I'm only a modernist

08:38.169 --> 08:39.344
on the surface.

08:39.388 --> 08:41.042
Deep down,
I'm really just Jung at heart.

08:41.085 --> 08:42.652
- Oh no you didn't.
Oh, my God.

08:42.696 --> 08:43.697
You know you get extra points

08:43.740 --> 08:45.133
for puns
in this department, right?

08:45.176 --> 08:46.656
- I didn't know there
were points.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.092
- I have a chart in my office.
- You have a point chart?

08:48.136 --> 08:49.354
- Yeah.
Sorry, Gladys, is Dr. Agliar

08:49.398 --> 08:51.008
our powerhouse or what?

08:51.052 --> 08:53.054
- Sorry it's actually about one
of your patients,

08:53.097 --> 08:54.403
Olivia Torres.

08:54.446 --> 08:55.665
- Olivia?
I just saw her yesterday.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.362
- Why?
What happened?

08:57.406 --> 08:58.842
- She committed suicide.

09:05.936 --> 09:09.244
- Tyler Grace, 35, penetrating
gunshot wound to his shoulder.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.202
- Shooting at
a supermarket near 123rd.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.944
The guy had an AR-15.
- You're about to be swamped.

09:13.988 --> 09:16.294
- Okay trauma one, let's pull
Leyla and Roxana to assist.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.601
- On it.
Roxana, Leyla.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.386
- Incoming.
Male, 40s, GSW to the abdomen.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.518
- Walsh.
- On it.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.347
- Go with him.
- Let's go.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.610
- Female, 52, GSW to both legs.

09:27.654 --> 09:28.959
- Okay, keep her moving.
Keep her moving.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.266
- 14-year-old male,
single GSW lower left leg.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.833
- I need the ED cleared.
Let's move him in there.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.793
I need surgery down here now.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.754
- Another shooting?
- We're getting slammed.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.190
- When does it end?

09:42.233 --> 09:44.409
- I need to take this one up
for a CT scan for a CTA.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.542
- Dr. Bloom, we can't get
the patient ventilated.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.717
- You're with me.

09:50.328 --> 09:51.895
What's the problem?
- The bullet--

09:51.939 --> 09:53.244
- The bullet shattered
the scapula, the ribs,

09:53.288 --> 09:54.942
and the clavicle.
- And dropped the lung.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.247
We're having
difficulty oxygenating him.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.727
- Move.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.779
Okay, let's place a chest tube
and get him to the OR.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.133
Floyd, what is it?

10:12.176 --> 10:13.961
- I know him.

10:21.403 --> 10:21.621
.

10:21.664 --> 10:24.319
- So because I won, NovaCo's
just gonna bury my research.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.974
- I know, I know, but hey,
50 grand for med school.

10:27.017 --> 10:29.367
That's a big deal.
- For myself.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.369
How can I feel good about that
when I was trying to foster

10:31.413 --> 10:33.981
global health equity
for millions of others?

10:34.024 --> 10:36.374
- Look, this sucks.
If you're trying to break

10:36.418 --> 10:38.812
the system, you're gonna run
into this feeling a lot.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.335
Trust me.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.989
But ask anyone
who's changed the world.

10:42.032 --> 10:42.946
They'll tell you the same
thing.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.121
You got to be bold.

10:44.165 --> 10:47.255
It's not about
when they say no.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.344
It's about what you
do next.

10:54.436 --> 10:58.266
- Hmm, you're right,
Dr. Goodwin.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.224
- Oh, that's very bold.

11:00.268 --> 11:01.878
I was kind of thinking maybe
you just had another idea.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.619
- I'm in
the world-changing business.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.709
So let's be bold together.

11:09.451 --> 11:10.844
- How can I help?

11:13.194 --> 11:14.761
- Oh!
- Oh, my--Sorry.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.327
Pardon me.
- No, I'm sorry.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.460
Helen, I just heard the news.

11:18.503 --> 11:21.202
London. Wow. Big change.

11:21.245 --> 11:24.509
- Oh, um, yes, well it, um,
it was time.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.729
- Wait, so is
the oncology department

11:26.773 --> 11:28.731
really in that much trouble?

11:28.775 --> 11:31.342
- No, of course not.
The department is fine.

11:31.386 --> 11:32.996
I have to apologize.
Do we know each other?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.432
- No, no, no, no.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.217
I'm the one
who needs to apologize

11:36.260 --> 11:37.740
because you don't know
me from Adam.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.046
- Oh good.

11:39.089 --> 11:41.135
- I know everything
about you, though.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.485
- Excuse me?
- Dr. Helen?

11:43.528 --> 11:46.053
From the telly.

11:46.096 --> 11:48.185
I'm sure it's really bad but--
- Course.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.709
- But I have a question.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.711
I couldn't help
but connect the dots.

11:51.754 --> 11:54.452
So Max is moving to London,
and you're moving to London.

11:54.496 --> 11:57.020
So the two of you--
- Yes.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.152
- Well, that's good.
That's good, then,

11:58.195 --> 11:59.370
that you're both leaving.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.503
- Really?
And why is that?

12:01.546 --> 12:04.767
- Well I mean, because
he's clearly your superior--

12:04.811 --> 12:07.378
at work I mean.

12:07.422 --> 12:10.468
And that could get you into
a lot of trouble with HR, so...

12:13.907 --> 12:17.127
- Excuse me?
I didn't catch your name.

12:20.043 --> 12:24.091
- Well, the flood of
patients has finally subsided.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.049
We're back under control.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.921
Hey, how did Leyla do
back there?

12:27.964 --> 12:29.400
- This my life now?

12:29.444 --> 12:31.228
Spying
on your girlfriend for you?

12:31.272 --> 12:33.448
- Obviously. Spill it.

12:33.491 --> 12:35.319
- What can I say?
She has excellent technique.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.278
Her experience shows.

12:37.321 --> 12:40.368
- Okay, don't test me, Casey.
I will break you.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.109
Details.

12:42.152 --> 12:45.416
Who ran the trauma?
- Roxana.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.288
- And who attempted
the initial intubation?

12:47.331 --> 12:50.204
- That was also Roxana.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.380
- So Leyla's just gonna
fade back?

12:52.423 --> 12:54.861
Let everyone else shine?
No way.

12:54.904 --> 12:58.125
No, she has to step it up.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.604
- Glad you dating a resident

12:59.648 --> 13:02.172
hasn't made things weird
around here.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.957
- Today was rough.
You know, I remember

13:04.000 --> 13:05.175
losing a patient

13:05.219 --> 13:06.916
my first year
out of med school.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.136
Gabriel Amato.

13:09.179 --> 13:12.269
I still remember
our last session.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.576
Just leveled me
all the way down.

13:14.619 --> 13:17.492
I had to take
an entire week off.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.886
So anyway, I wanted to let
you know that I read

13:19.929 --> 13:21.365
your SOAP notes
from your sessions, and it is

13:21.409 --> 13:22.889
so abundantly clear
that you knew

13:22.932 --> 13:24.325
your patient's
underlying issues

13:24.368 --> 13:25.805
and you were treating
her conditions, all of them.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.372
Wandy, you did--you
did everything right.

13:30.026 --> 13:32.028
- I know.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.336
- Oh you--oh, you do.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.164
- I mean I wrote my thesis on
cognitive behavioral therapy.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.340
- No no, I know.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.472
Yeah, I read it.
I just, um...

13:41.516 --> 13:44.998
Losing a patient is, um--
- Tragic.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.565
- Yeah.
- Yes, but as they say,

13:47.609 --> 13:49.089
you can be the best
cardiologist in the world,

13:49.132 --> 13:51.918
and you'll still lose
some patients to heart attacks.

13:51.961 --> 13:55.573
- Yeah, that's not
the comparison I would make.

13:55.617 --> 13:59.403
- We're clinicians, Dr. Frome.
We're not their friends.

13:59.447 --> 14:03.886
Intellectually, it's a loss,
certainly, but...

14:03.930 --> 14:05.670
I still have a full afternoon

14:05.714 --> 14:09.196
of other patients
who still need my help.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.198
Are we done here?

14:11.241 --> 14:13.896
- Oh, yeah, okay.
Yeah, yeah.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.550
- Thank you.
- No problem.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.431
- Picture it: turnips as far
as the eye can see.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.216
By the way, how many do you
think you're gonna need?

14:29.259 --> 14:31.740
- Around 95,000.

14:31.783 --> 14:32.959
- Wow, okay.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.395
We may have to find
some more balconies.

14:34.438 --> 14:37.964
- And there they are.
- Mom, Dad, this is so cool.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.443
- These are your folks?

14:39.487 --> 14:41.750
Wow I'm Max Goodwin,
medical director.

14:41.793 --> 14:44.318
It is an honor to meet
the people who created this

14:44.361 --> 14:47.277
incredible, passionate,
talented, young woman.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.410
Have you come to
check out her new venture?

14:49.453 --> 14:51.455
- No they're here
because of this,

14:51.499 --> 14:53.501
curtesy
of NovaCo Pharmaceuticals.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.720
Turns out they also heard
about your little venture,

14:55.764 --> 14:58.593
and now they're suing
for breach of contract,

14:58.636 --> 15:01.248
$550 million.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.599
- Wow.
Well, we'll just see what

15:04.642 --> 15:06.470
our legal department has
to say about this.

15:06.514 --> 15:09.082
- They aren't suing
your hospital, Dr. Goodwin.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.432
They're only suing
our daughter.

15:15.697 --> 15:19.222
- Heads up.
Make a hole.

15:19.266 --> 15:20.963
Coming through.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.660
Come on, come on.
Come on.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.579
- Patient with a GSW
to the right thorax.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.320
Here for a thoracotomy
with a subsequent

15:30.364 --> 15:32.583
vascular and chest wall
reconstruction.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.498
- We're gonna lift on three.

15:34.542 --> 15:37.153
Ready. One, two, three.

15:42.332 --> 15:44.160
Wait, this--this--

15:47.947 --> 15:49.731
- Dr. Reynolds,

15:49.774 --> 15:51.863
when you're done scrubbing in,
we'll be ready to go.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.517
- Yeah.

16:00.263 --> 16:00.437
.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.918
- They have a strong case.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.354
- This morning, our daughter
was valedictorian.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.052
She won the biggest
science fair in the state

16:06.095 --> 16:09.185
with a cash prize that would
help pay for med school.

16:09.229 --> 16:12.319
And then you encourage a child
to throw her life away.

16:12.362 --> 16:13.929
- I'm not a child.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.192
And if NovaCo wants to sue,
let's go to court.

16:16.236 --> 16:18.934
- You're not going anywhere.
You're grounded.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.284
- What I'd give to be able
to ground you, too.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.852
- I'm sure you would. Listen,
we're gonna figure this out.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.898
Okay? I can call
Banneker Med School right now.

16:26.942 --> 16:28.030
I promise you
they're not gonna care

16:28.074 --> 16:29.597
about some ridiculous lawsuit.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.774
- Dr. Goodwin, NovaCo's
on the board at Banekker.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.602
- Really?

16:34.645 --> 16:36.386
Wish I had that information

16:36.430 --> 16:38.040
before I said that.
Um--

16:38.084 --> 16:39.999
There are a lot of
other great schools.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.088
And NovaCo's on the board
of just about all of them.

16:42.131 --> 16:43.437
They're gonna make sure our
daughter

16:43.480 --> 16:44.960
never gets in anywhere.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.614
She's not
from generational wealth.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.268
This was her shot.
This.

16:52.141 --> 16:54.230
- All I can say is that
until I make this right,

16:54.274 --> 16:56.015
I'm gonna be by
your daughter's side.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.104
- No, you'll be by her side
for the next five weeks,

16:58.147 --> 17:00.541
and then you're leaving
the country.

17:00.584 --> 17:04.066
We do business with NovaCo.
I know their top people.

17:04.110 --> 17:07.069
I can get them to back off,
but only if Imani agrees

17:07.113 --> 17:11.682
to leave her turnip sutures
back at the science fair.

17:11.726 --> 17:14.076
Let it go.
- She will.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.469
Thank you.
- Hold up.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.906
Dad, I'm 18.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.995
This is my decision.
This is my life.

17:22.345 --> 17:25.087
Look, making the world better's
hard but I learned it's not

17:25.131 --> 17:27.481
about when they say no.
It's about what you do next.

17:29.744 --> 17:32.834
Whatever you think I should do
next, Dr. G, I'll do it.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.116
- I hope you don't think
I'm being too forward.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.205
- I do not. I'm glad
you're speaking right now.

17:56.249 --> 17:58.860
I hate elevator silence more
than anything in the world.

17:58.903 --> 18:01.993
- You're Dr. Ignatius Frome,
chair of behavioral health,

18:02.037 --> 18:03.821
right?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:03.865 --> 18:07.042
So much for being incognito.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.000
- Um, I couldn't help
but notice that

18:09.044 --> 18:11.655
your nurse-to-patient ratio
on your ward

18:11.699 --> 18:13.918
is very disconcerting.

18:13.962 --> 18:17.052
- Yeah, it is.
I know, right?

18:17.096 --> 18:18.140
But, I'm sorry,
what's your name?

18:18.184 --> 18:19.228
I didn't catch it.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.926
- 13-to-1 ratio, to be exact.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.667
- You counted.
- I did, yeah.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.409
Unfortunately, those numbers
puts your department

18:26.453 --> 18:28.803
at the bottom of most
of the New York State

18:28.846 --> 18:30.021
public hospitals.

18:30.065 --> 18:31.936
So...
- Yeah. Why--

18:31.980 --> 18:34.461
Yeah, you know,
I've written HCC,

18:34.504 --> 18:36.245
and I've petitioned the board,
and at this point

18:36.289 --> 18:38.160
I would do anything to get them
to take me seriously.

18:38.204 --> 18:39.944
- Anything?
- Yeah.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.859
Yeah, anything within reason,
you know.

18:43.470 --> 18:46.908
Well, you know, I used
to work at this hospital

18:46.951 --> 18:49.650
that, for legal reasons,
I can't really name.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.696
But we had
the exact same nursing shortage

18:52.740 --> 18:55.438
on our psych ward,
and we fixed it overnight.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.571
- Overnight?
How did you find the nurses?

18:57.614 --> 18:59.094
- Oh, no, we didn't.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.489
We cut the patients.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.360
Oh, this is me.
Very nice to meet you.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.754
- Yeah, yeah, you too.
Take care.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.843
- You, too.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.497
- You paged me?
- What?

19:10.540 --> 19:12.194
Yes. Yeah I did.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.848
Um, I need you--I need you
to reassign

19:13.891 --> 19:14.805
all of Wandy's cases.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.329
Clear the decks.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.069
- All of them?
- Yes. Do it, please.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.332
Thank you.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.205
Thank you.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.121
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:29.124 --> 19:30.560
- Why you letting
the other residents

19:30.604 --> 19:32.606
take the lead
on every procedure?

19:32.649 --> 19:34.216
- Are you spying on me?

19:34.260 --> 19:36.697
- You are the most
skilled resident in my ED,

19:36.740 --> 19:37.959
but you don't act like it.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.352
It's like you're stepping up
to the plate

19:39.395 --> 19:40.918
and you're gonna
strike out looking.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.573
Okay, you gotta take some cuts.
Give the ball a ride.

19:43.617 --> 19:46.707
- Is that basketball?
- Baseball.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.144
- Hmm.
- Never mind.

19:49.188 --> 19:53.540
Look, I was like Roxana
when I was a resident.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.324
Cutthroat, driven.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.370
She's gonna take
every advantage she can,

19:57.413 --> 19:59.285
which is why you need
to show everyone

19:59.328 --> 20:01.243
just how capable you are.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.984
I mean, where's
the woman who pulled off

20:03.027 --> 20:04.986
a renegade
needle decompression?

20:05.029 --> 20:10.078
Where's the woman who pinned me
down in bed this morning?

20:10.121 --> 20:12.211
- She's right here.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.300
- Well, then show them.

20:14.343 --> 20:17.259
Stop keeping how amazing
you are all to yourself.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.959
- Okay.
Okay, I will.

20:22.003 --> 20:24.135
I will ride the ball
or whatever.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.660
- Maybe you're more
of a hockey person.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.842
- We assume you've come
to comply with our demands.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.147
Sign this,

20:36.191 --> 20:38.149
and the suture matter
will be settled.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.589
- No, thank you.

20:44.939 --> 20:47.681
- So you're choosing a trial
against the fourth largest

20:47.724 --> 20:49.639
pharmaceutical company
in the country?

20:49.683 --> 20:52.425
- No, absolutely not.
That sounds terrifying.

20:52.468 --> 20:53.991
No, we'd like
door number three.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.297
That's the one
where we don't fight

20:55.341 --> 20:57.995
because we're working together.

20:58.039 --> 21:01.956
You could sue this 18-year-old
girl for half a billion dollars

21:01.999 --> 21:05.307
that she doesn't have,
or you could walk out of here

21:05.351 --> 21:08.310
with a vast,
new, untapped market:

21:08.354 --> 21:11.487
the entire developing world.
Think about it.

21:11.531 --> 21:14.360
There are over 100 countries
that can't afford

21:14.403 --> 21:17.798
your smart sutures,
but they can afford turnips.

21:17.841 --> 21:21.192
You can improve health care
for half the planet

21:21.236 --> 21:23.630
and turn a profit
while doing it.

21:23.673 --> 21:25.458
I don't know how you could
say no to that.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.641
- We'll see you in court.

21:34.684 --> 21:38.297
- Wait, wait, wait.
Um, don't do this.

21:40.124 --> 21:41.735
This could change the world.

21:43.127 --> 21:45.869
- And this is the clause
in the science fair application

21:45.913 --> 21:49.046
which states that NovaCo owns
the winner's IP.

21:49.090 --> 21:52.354
We can sell it, sit on it,
we can put it in a cookbook.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.965
And that's Imani's signature.

21:55.009 --> 21:58.534
Next time, read the fine print.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.585
- Bullet's out.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.587
- Blood pressure's
dropping.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.371
- Bleeder?
- I don't see it.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.068
- Well, it must be
something else.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.461
- Myocardial infarction?

22:12.505 --> 22:13.680
- I was thinking
adrenal crisis.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.638
- Could be a
renal--There, look.

22:15.682 --> 22:17.379
Piece of the bone fragment
from the scapula must have

22:17.423 --> 22:19.294
penetrated the diaphragm
and lodged into the abdomen.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.904
- Like a small dagger.
- Yeah.

22:20.948 --> 22:23.124
- Hang a unit of blood.
- And push calcium chloride

22:23.167 --> 22:27.650
to help the clotting.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.173
Wait, stop.

22:35.615 --> 22:40.097
- Would you rather go with TXA?

22:40.141 --> 22:43.449
- Sorry, no. No, no, no.
Just, um--

22:45.146 --> 22:46.974
Push the calcium chloride.
Sorry.

22:47.017 --> 22:50.804
- Okay. I'm gonna go and
grab Dr. Hartman to assist.

22:58.725 --> 22:58.942
.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.249
- Not now.
- It's important.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.338
- Like your love
of kickboxing important

23:03.382 --> 23:05.384
or like a patient is coding
important?

23:05.427 --> 23:08.561
- If I'm forced to choose,
somewhere right in the middle.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.389
That woman has been
hanging around

23:10.432 --> 23:13.609
our ED for the last half hour.
- She with a patient?

23:13.653 --> 23:15.785
- Nope, just walking around,

23:15.829 --> 23:18.658
taking notes
like that dude in "Moneyball."

23:18.701 --> 23:20.529
- Hey.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.139
You.
What the hell you doing here?

23:22.183 --> 23:23.924
You know what?
I don't even care. Okay?

23:23.967 --> 23:26.274
You're a walking
HIPPA violation, and maybe

23:26.317 --> 23:28.189
you've been living
on a desert island or a--

23:28.232 --> 23:30.278
I don't know--the
International Space Station?

23:30.321 --> 23:32.454
But, uh, here on Earth,
we've been dealing

23:32.498 --> 23:34.238
with a mass global pandemic,

23:34.282 --> 23:37.111
so we don't really take
too kindly to strangers just

23:37.154 --> 23:38.852
hanging around
the emergency department

23:38.895 --> 23:40.070
of a public hospital.

23:40.114 --> 23:41.463
So take your failed screenplay,

23:41.507 --> 23:42.769
or whatever the hell it is

23:42.812 --> 23:45.946
you're writing, and, uh,
get the hell out of here

23:45.989 --> 23:47.774
before I have my bouncers
throw you out.

23:50.385 --> 23:52.300
- You must be Dr. Bloom.

23:59.350 --> 24:00.874
- Thank you.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.494
- When were you going
to tell me?

24:12.538 --> 24:14.322
- Uh, Karen, listen--

24:14.365 --> 24:16.367
- Were you waiting to give
a pedestrian two weeks' notice

24:16.411 --> 24:18.369
or just shoot me an email
when you and Max

24:18.413 --> 24:20.284
were somewhere over
the Atlantic?

24:20.328 --> 24:23.157
- I wanted to tell you,
but it was never 100%.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.159
- So instead you just
blindsided me

24:25.202 --> 24:27.030
in front of the whole hospital.

24:29.990 --> 24:33.384
- That was selfish.
- Damn right, it was selfish.

24:33.428 --> 24:36.213
And incredibly romantic.

24:38.215 --> 24:41.349
I'd throw flowers at you myself
if I wasn't so pissed.

24:43.612 --> 24:46.354
- Well, if it's
any consolation, I have no idea

24:46.397 --> 24:47.790
how I'm gonna live
with the man.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.836
He is chaos personified.

24:49.879 --> 24:52.534
- A whirling dervish
of unbridled optimism.

24:52.578 --> 24:55.015
Always overreaching

24:55.058 --> 24:57.365
but, more often
than one might expect,

24:57.408 --> 25:01.282
somehow making the world
just a little bit better.

25:01.325 --> 25:04.067
And yet never quite remembering
to cap the toothpaste.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.682
I don't know.
Everything just seems--

25:09.725 --> 25:11.901
it seems so out of control.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.948
- There's a thousand reasons
you two

25:14.991 --> 25:17.733
shouldn't move in together,
and a thousand more

25:17.777 --> 25:19.648
why you shouldn't move
to London.

25:19.692 --> 25:22.346
But only one reason to do
any of it.

25:24.174 --> 25:26.481
So if you're thinking about
how he squeezes the toothpaste

25:26.525 --> 25:28.962
this early on,

25:29.005 --> 25:31.486
maybe it's because
you know it's a mistake.

25:38.885 --> 25:40.582
For what it's worth,

25:40.626 --> 25:43.672
I'll take him off your hands
in a heartbeat.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.855
- So that's it, then?

25:52.899 --> 25:55.336
They win?
It's over?

25:55.379 --> 25:57.556
- Yeah.

25:57.599 --> 26:02.778
Oh, but I did get something.
Might cheer you up.

26:07.653 --> 26:08.958
- What is this?

26:09.002 --> 26:11.178
- One share of NovaCo stock
in your name.

26:11.221 --> 26:15.225
It's worth exactly $17.10.

26:15.269 --> 26:16.662
- Okay?
- You're officially

26:16.705 --> 26:19.186
disqualified from the Five
Borough's Science Fair.

26:21.318 --> 26:24.104
Students are prohibited
from having any kind

26:24.147 --> 26:25.322
of financial relationship

26:25.366 --> 26:26.889
with NovaCo
or its subsidiaries.

26:28.325 --> 26:31.111
You gotta read the fine print.

26:31.154 --> 26:35.028
- So that--that means?
- Volcano guy won.

26:35.071 --> 26:37.813
And you get your idea back.

26:40.424 --> 26:43.253
You get your ide--No?
It's great news.

26:43.297 --> 26:46.648
- Why?
No one's ever gonna buy it.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.912
I could create
50 game-changing innovations,

26:49.956 --> 26:51.653
but no big pharma
company's gonna sign on

26:51.697 --> 26:53.916
to make less money.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.570
How can I fix the world

26:55.614 --> 26:57.528
when the people in charge
want it to stay broken?

26:57.572 --> 27:00.140
- Well, you could,
you know, go rogue.

27:00.183 --> 27:02.185
Do it indie style together.

27:02.229 --> 27:05.841
I mean come on, the roofs
of New Amsterdam are calling.

27:05.885 --> 27:08.844
- Are you really leaving
in five weeks?

27:08.888 --> 27:13.632
- Uh--
Yeah.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.851
- And can you promise me
that the next medical director

27:15.895 --> 27:18.680
will keep my turnip farm going?

27:18.724 --> 27:20.856
- No.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.690
- You know, you taught me
something important,

27:28.734 --> 27:30.431
Dr. Goodwin.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.347
When someone says
they can change the world,

27:33.390 --> 27:35.349
don't listen.

27:40.484 --> 27:41.703
- Cardiogenic shock,

27:41.747 --> 27:44.097
likely anterior wall
myocardial infarction.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.708
- Sending labs including
troponin and paging cardiology.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.276
- Placing central line in case
we need pressors.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.669
- Okay.
- Use ultrasound guidance.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.322
- Don't need it.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.542
- Your patient is hypotensive,
Dr. Shinwari.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.675
That's a tough placement,
you're gonna need it.

27:56.718 --> 27:57.893
- I actually won't.

27:57.937 --> 27:59.373
- Okay, that wasn't
a suggestion.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.201
I said use ultrasound guidance.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.811
- Yes, and I disagreed
with your assessment.

28:02.855 --> 28:05.205
So I'm doing it my way.
- And risk a pneumothorax?

28:05.248 --> 28:06.859
- There's always a risk,
and you know it,

28:06.902 --> 28:08.034
even with ultrasound.

28:08.077 --> 28:09.600
- But it is less of a risk.

28:09.644 --> 28:12.125
We have the technology
for a reason.

28:12.168 --> 28:14.649
Use it.
- You can use it

28:14.693 --> 28:16.564
with your patient, but
I'm not using it with mine.

28:16.607 --> 28:17.783
- Okay, that is it.

28:17.826 --> 28:18.871
Dr. Shinwari, step away
from the patient.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.742
- Quiet.
I need to focus.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.439
- Leyla, this is not what I--

28:23.789 --> 28:26.095
- Got it.
Hand me the introducer.

28:30.056 --> 28:32.058
I trained in Kashmir
when the killing

28:32.101 --> 28:34.016
of a Hizbul Mujahideen militant

28:34.060 --> 28:35.757
caused an uprising,
and we had to learn to do

28:35.801 --> 28:39.805
every procedure in the dark
or during a mortar attack.

28:39.848 --> 28:45.941
So all of this technology,
all of these crutches,

28:45.985 --> 28:48.074
they only get in my way.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.564
- Bone fragment lacerated
multiple arteries.

29:00.608 --> 29:03.959
As soon as I suture one,
another bleeder breaks loose.

29:04.003 --> 29:06.179
Where the hell's my backup?

29:06.222 --> 29:10.270
- artery.
Not lacerating.

29:10.313 --> 29:13.273
Lin?
What are you doing here?

29:13.316 --> 29:15.623
Where's Hartman?
- Hartman? Why?

29:15.666 --> 29:17.016
I'm here to remove
a bullet fragment

29:17.059 --> 29:18.626
from a patient's uterus.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.193
- What the hell?

29:26.808 --> 29:28.897
- Is something wrong?

29:28.941 --> 29:30.638
- I'm just...

29:33.772 --> 29:35.512
Give me a second.

30:08.197 --> 30:09.720
- You okay, Floyd?

30:23.169 --> 30:26.041
- Sorry, it's just...

30:29.131 --> 30:31.046
Okay, I'm good.

30:36.617 --> 30:38.271
- You benched me?

30:38.314 --> 30:40.273
- Uh, we can discuss
my decision if you calm down.

30:40.316 --> 30:41.927
- I did everything right,
Dr. Frome.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.363
Those were your exact words.

30:43.406 --> 30:45.147
And now--now I'm being
penalized for it?

30:45.191 --> 30:46.714
- You lost a patient today,

30:46.757 --> 30:48.716
and I'm concerned that you are
not processing your grief.

30:48.759 --> 30:51.110
- Why, because I'm not reacting
to it the same way you would?

30:51.153 --> 30:53.068
Taking a week off,
wallowing in it?

30:56.332 --> 30:57.768
- You are one
of the brightest residents

30:57.812 --> 30:59.118
I have ever worked with,

30:59.161 --> 31:00.771
but if you can't be honest
about your feelings,

31:00.815 --> 31:02.599
how can you be there
for your patients?

31:04.123 --> 31:06.908
- So--so what, you--you want me

31:06.952 --> 31:08.954
to say that what happened today
freaked me out?

31:08.997 --> 31:10.346
- Sounds good.
Let's start there.

31:10.390 --> 31:11.391
- Okay, it did.
Of course it did,

31:11.434 --> 31:13.393
but I can't let that in.

31:13.436 --> 31:16.222
I can't let it even get close.
- All right.

31:16.265 --> 31:19.007
I want to try something, okay?

31:19.051 --> 31:20.574
An exercise.
- Dr. Frome--

31:20.617 --> 31:21.923
- Just an exercise.
- Dr. Frome,

31:21.967 --> 31:24.230
I'm not your patient.
- Listen, close your eyes.

31:26.710 --> 31:27.798
Close your eyes.

31:31.585 --> 31:32.934
- Good. Okay.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.110
Now take a deep breath in.

31:36.982 --> 31:39.201
And then slowly exhale.

31:41.987 --> 31:44.380
Okay.

31:44.424 --> 31:46.426
Now, just for a moment,

31:46.469 --> 31:49.820
I want you to acknowledge
what happened.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.869
Actually let it in.

32:26.074 --> 32:29.164
Is this what you wanted?

32:29.208 --> 32:31.601
- Wandy, these are
your feelings.

32:31.645 --> 32:32.994
- So what?

32:33.038 --> 32:34.343
I can't feel like this

32:34.387 --> 32:37.564
every time a patient has
a setback.

32:37.607 --> 32:42.830
What in the world would make
you think this way is better?

32:42.873 --> 32:45.311
God.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.195
- This has been going on
for a week.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.853
One
mass shooting after another.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.208
<i>I don't know how
he handled it. </i>

33:15.558 --> 33:17.821
<i>This has been going on
for a week. </i>

33:22.261 --> 33:22.652
.

33:22.696 --> 33:24.437
- Gladys, can you put
these cases

33:24.480 --> 33:25.568
back on my rotation, please?

33:25.612 --> 33:27.657
- Sure.
Who should I assign them to?

33:27.701 --> 33:30.269
- Wandy.
- I see.

33:30.312 --> 33:31.357
You helped her.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.141
You worked your Iggy magic
on her.

33:33.185 --> 33:35.056
- No. No magic.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.276
- So what changed?
- Nothing.

33:37.319 --> 33:39.104
Not a thing.
I just--I can't expect her

33:39.147 --> 33:41.758
to have all the answers when
I don't have them myself.

33:41.802 --> 33:44.109
- Oh shoot.
- What?

33:44.152 --> 33:47.764
- I didn't know that having all
the answers was required of us.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.244
Maybe I should pack my bags

33:49.288 --> 33:52.073
and go knit with my retired
aunts in Tallahassee.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.423
- That's a really
strange alternative, but okay.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.338
- And I know Raul doesn't
have all the answers,

33:56.382 --> 33:59.124
so he should probably stop
training the nurses.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.648
- Okay.

34:01.691 --> 34:04.042
Clever, thank you.
I get it.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.391
- I mean,

34:05.434 --> 34:07.175
you didn't actually think
you had all the answers,

34:07.219 --> 34:08.176
did you?

34:12.311 --> 34:14.791
- Uh, yes, I did.

34:14.835 --> 34:18.230
- Did Wandy think she had
all the answers?

34:18.273 --> 34:19.970
- Yeah, I think she did.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.799
- Then it seems
like a lot changed today.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.415
Or...

34:29.458 --> 34:32.679
I could assign these cases to a
really wonderful shrink I know.

34:34.811 --> 34:35.986
- No.

34:37.336 --> 34:38.946
Wandy's ready.

34:47.389 --> 34:50.044
- Dr. Rahul Nagendran
and I go way back.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.567
And I'm telling you,
the guy just loves it

34:51.611 --> 34:53.787
when I show up out of the blue
and just rock his world.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.528
- He sure didn't see happy
to see you.

34:55.571 --> 34:57.051
- No he didn't.
Uh, excuse me.

34:57.095 --> 35:00.924
Is that aloo tikki?
Thank you very much.

35:00.968 --> 35:04.363
Oh wow, that's so good.
Holy moly.

35:04.406 --> 35:06.452
- You know, I hate to admit it,
Max, but you were right.

35:06.495 --> 35:08.236
This proposal is phenomenal.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.977
It's exactly what we look for
in our students.

35:10.020 --> 35:12.849
- I forgot to mention,
Dr. Nagendran is the dean

35:12.893 --> 35:14.286
of Columbia's college
of arts and sciences.

35:14.329 --> 35:17.158
- Imani, I'd like to offer you
a full scholarship.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.987
- Shut up.
Are--are you serious?

35:20.030 --> 35:21.989
- In addition to our thorough
science curriculum,

35:22.032 --> 35:23.860
we offer classes
in microfinance,

35:23.904 --> 35:26.036
entrepreneurship,
and even marketing.

35:29.910 --> 35:31.303
- Now, if you'll excuse me,

35:31.346 --> 35:33.348
I probably should get back
to my daughter's wedding.

35:33.392 --> 35:35.872
- Of course. Um, Rahul--

35:35.916 --> 35:38.005
- Yes.
- Thank you.

35:38.048 --> 35:40.442
- You did all this for me?

35:40.486 --> 35:42.183
- You earned it.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.185
Now you learn how to take your
idea to market all on your own.

35:44.229 --> 35:47.057
And then,
and I truly believe this,

35:47.101 --> 35:48.929
you're gonna fix the world.

35:58.547 --> 36:01.550
- There was so many this week.

36:01.594 --> 36:05.119
I couldn't keep them all
straight in my head.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.992
I mean the nightclub shooting
after the...

36:09.036 --> 36:11.734
high school shooting
and then the...

36:11.778 --> 36:14.041
warehouse shooting.

36:14.084 --> 36:15.390
And Monday was that shooter

36:15.434 --> 36:18.088
at the grocery store
near my place.

36:18.132 --> 36:20.743
I see him around
my neighborhood all the time

36:20.787 --> 36:23.790
with his wife
and his two girls.

36:23.833 --> 36:27.489
He was just picking up
groceries,

36:27.533 --> 36:31.406
just living his life.

36:31.450 --> 36:34.322
It could've been you.

36:34.366 --> 36:38.413
It could've been me.

36:38.457 --> 36:41.024
It's everywhere.

36:41.068 --> 36:44.245
I used to feel...

36:44.289 --> 36:45.638
outrage.

36:45.681 --> 36:48.510
You know what?

36:48.554 --> 36:51.252
I used to think
it didn't have to be like this.

36:51.296 --> 36:54.168
We don't have to live
like this.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.563
But now,

36:57.606 --> 37:01.349
it's like we traded
one pandemic in for another.

37:05.048 --> 37:09.444
- Here's an idea:

37:09.488 --> 37:11.316
your place tonight.

37:15.015 --> 37:17.147
- I wish...

37:17.191 --> 37:19.019
But it's not my night.

37:21.021 --> 37:25.025
- So we make an exception.

37:29.464 --> 37:32.511
Meet me downstairs.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.788
- You.

37:51.747 --> 37:53.445
- In here.

38:05.108 --> 38:06.632
- Whoa, wait, whoa.

38:06.675 --> 38:09.417
- That was so freaking hot,
I can barely contain myself.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.593
- You're not mad?

38:11.637 --> 38:14.117
- That's the woman
I fell in love with.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.555
Okay, here's
a baseball reference for you.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.861
When we get home later,

38:18.905 --> 38:23.910
you're not gonna be striking
out.

38:23.953 --> 38:28.262
- It's just that tonight,
I have plans

38:28.306 --> 38:30.873
with Roxana, believe it or not.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.527
After I stood up to you,

38:32.571 --> 38:35.313
she invited me out
with the other residents.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.750
I just had to show them
who I am.

38:37.793 --> 38:40.361
Thank you.

38:40.405 --> 38:44.060
- Well, I guess were just gonna
have to make do here.

38:44.104 --> 38:48.064
But if you ever do that
again in my ED,

38:48.108 --> 38:51.807
war-torn Kashmir will feel
like a vacation

38:51.851 --> 38:55.333
compared to the hellfire
I will bring down upon you.

38:58.205 --> 39:01.513
But more of that
in private, please.

39:08.955 --> 39:12.524
- How are you?

39:12.567 --> 39:14.526
Your place or mine?

39:18.704 --> 39:21.924
You're scaring me.
- Okay, can I, um--

39:21.968 --> 39:24.623
I just have to say...
- Mm-hmm.

39:24.666 --> 39:26.407
- That all day, I have been

39:26.451 --> 39:29.236
thinking about
our living situation.

39:29.279 --> 39:30.672
- Situation does not
sound great.

39:30.716 --> 39:33.153
- No, that's because
it's not great.

39:37.244 --> 39:40.813
Your place is just so, um--

39:40.856 --> 39:43.903
it's, uh, it's--it's cramped.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.426
And don't take this
the wrong way,

39:45.470 --> 39:46.862
but you're not exactly
a neat freak.

39:46.906 --> 39:48.255
Plus, there's all
of Luna's things

39:48.298 --> 39:50.562
perched everywhere you look.
There's no privacy.

39:50.605 --> 39:52.607
Our London flat
wouldn't be any larger,

39:52.651 --> 39:55.305
which means something has
to change.

39:57.438 --> 39:59.266
Um...

39:59.309 --> 40:02.182
I have made
a unilateral decision.

40:06.926 --> 40:10.190
We have to get used to this.
I am moving in with you.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.891
- Kind of thought that was
going in a different direction.

40:15.935 --> 40:18.633
- I'd be lying if I said that
wasn't somewhat intentional.

40:18.677 --> 40:20.113
- Well done, 'cause
you kind of nailed me.

40:20.156 --> 40:22.071
- Thank you.
- Are you moving in?

40:22.115 --> 40:24.596
- Yes, but there will
be tidying.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.564
- Yes.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40:36.608 --> 40:38.479
I'm sorry,

40:38.523 --> 40:40.481
I'm a little emotional.
I'm sorry, this is--

40:40.525 --> 40:44.224
I'm just so damn happy
for you guys, and I'm--

40:44.267 --> 40:45.834
I'm gonna miss you both.
- Get in here.

40:45.878 --> 40:49.142
Just get in here. Bring it in.
Bring it in.

41:46.460 --> 41:48.723
- I'm glad you all are here.

41:48.767 --> 41:50.551
- Oh, because you want to--
you want to bring it in.

41:50.595 --> 41:53.336
- No, because I'd like
to introduce you all

41:53.380 --> 41:57.515
to the new medical director
of New Amsterdam.

41:57.558 --> 41:58.951
Veronica.

42:02.955 --> 42:06.045
- No.

42:06.088 --> 42:08.917
Really?

42:08.961 --> 42:11.354
You hired her?

42:11.398 --> 42:14.096
- Good to see you, too.

42:14.140 --> 42:16.664
We go way back.

42:16.708 --> 42:18.187
Don't we, Max?
