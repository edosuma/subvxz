Babatunde
Adesola Johnson was born

00:51.233 --> 00:53.235
on December 30th, 2002

00:53.268 --> 00:55.203
to Adesola Johnson

00:55.237 --> 00:57.372
and Yomi Okafor
in Lagos, Nigeria.

00:58.373 --> 01:01.243
On the night of May 28th, 2020,

01:01.276 --> 01:02.812
Tunde Johnson departed this life

01:02.845 --> 01:06.114
at 9:38 p.m. in Los
Angeles, California.

01:16.692 --> 01:18.293
Soren.

01:22.397 --> 01:25.200
Well, there he is, folks.

01:25.233 --> 01:26.301
The one and only.

01:29.271 --> 01:31.507
This is way better
than class, right?

01:40.850 --> 01:42.317
Blow me a kiss.

01:43.452 --> 01:44.286
Ooh.

01:46.121 --> 01:47.322
Let me see you wipe your hair.

01:55.665 --> 01:57.098
Yes, nice.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.835
Do we go?

01:59.869 --> 02:00.703
Okay.

02:01.269 --> 02:02.437
What'd you catch for me?

03:05.835 --> 03:06.902
Hi, I'm Alfred O'Connor.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.537
Thanks for watching tonight.

03:08.571 --> 03:10.305
Our point of contact
for the evening

03:10.338 --> 03:13.576
in light of the tragic shooting
of an unarmed black teen

03:13.609 --> 03:14.376
is police brutality.

03:14.409 --> 03:16.846
It's masochistic
is all I'm saying.

03:17.312 --> 03:18.814
Great art...

03:18.848 --> 03:20.716
- ...comes from great pain.
- We have Keisha Rivera,

03:20.750 --> 03:23.184
political organizer
based in Chicago

03:23.218 --> 03:25.186
and Marcus Harrison,

03:25.220 --> 03:27.757
an author and professor of
African American studies.

03:28.524 --> 03:29.324
- Welcome.
- Hi.

03:29.357 --> 03:30.392
Thank
you for having us.

03:30.425 --> 03:32.495
Now, I wanna be
clear to the both of you

03:32.528 --> 03:33.596
and to the viewers at home

03:33.629 --> 03:35.898
that there was no way that
I, or any white person

03:35.931 --> 03:37.700
for that matter, will
ever fully comprehend

03:37.733 --> 03:38.934
the emotional complexity

03:38.968 --> 03:40.770
of what it is to be
black in America.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.605
That is
right, Mr. O'Connor.

03:42.638 --> 03:44.339
Experiences, more
often than not,

03:44.372 --> 03:45.440
- get lost in translation.
- Hey.

03:45.474 --> 03:46.676
They can only be lived.

03:46.709 --> 03:48.678
They can be
witnessed as well.

03:48.711 --> 03:51.379
Um, I need To talk to you
guys about something.

03:52.715 --> 03:53.983
Now, let me
paint you a picture.

03:54.016 --> 03:57.820
Okay, you're a beat
cop, average American.

03:57.853 --> 03:59.689
No, oh, Honey, no
don't, don't go.

03:59.722 --> 04:02.290
Ade, Your son needs
to talk to you.

04:02.323 --> 04:02.925
I'm working.

04:02.958 --> 04:03.859
Can he wait?

04:03.893 --> 04:04.760
Ade.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.562
A wife, two kids,

04:06.595 --> 04:08.396
and a dog chasing his
tail in the front yard.

04:08.430 --> 04:09.565
This is your life.

04:09.598 --> 04:13.502
Hey, come sit next to me.

04:13.536 --> 04:14.704
The
possibility of death.

04:14.737 --> 04:16.237
Now, when faced with this,

04:16.271 --> 04:18.474
whether you're white,
black, or green-

04:18.507 --> 04:20.976
Where are these green people
being shot by the police?

04:25.548 --> 04:27.516
I'm having really
abstract ideas.

04:30.486 --> 04:34.623
Colors, hues, my
next photo series.

04:38.494 --> 04:39.394
Something...

04:42.865 --> 04:46.669
something like, deconstruction.

04:47.737 --> 04:52.775
A young African American
male, or Black masculinity.

04:58.714 --> 05:00.415
I keep seeing red.

05:06.689 --> 05:08.891
...shot and killed
at the hand of the law.

05:08.924 --> 05:10.659
Which is a
racist institution.

05:10.693 --> 05:12.393
Well, no
intelligent person

05:12.427 --> 05:14.663
disregards the unfortunate
history of Africa...

05:14.697 --> 05:16.599
So Marley comes up to me today,

05:18.768 --> 05:22.605
and she just kinda

05:22.638 --> 05:24.774
presses her finger
against my chest.

05:27.408 --> 05:31.680
And, um, and you know
how she can be.

05:33.616 --> 05:35.684
Well, she sees, she's
a lovely girl, Tunde.

05:35.718 --> 05:37.520
Yeah, we've taken a
liking to over the years.

05:38.721 --> 05:39.455
Right.

05:42.591 --> 05:45.828
So, she presses her
finger against my chest,

05:47.797 --> 05:49.899
and she is all like,

05:54.435 --> 05:59.440
"It would behoove you
to tell your parents...

06:01.744 --> 06:04.013
"It would behoove you to tell
your parents that you're gay."

06:10.019 --> 06:10.853
Ta-da.

06:17.026 --> 06:18.928
I am so proud of you.

06:20.696 --> 06:22.698
Mom, we talked about this.

06:22.731 --> 06:23.599
Okay, okay, okay.

06:26.669 --> 06:28.403
I will respect your boundaries.

06:32.808 --> 06:34.109
How long have you known?

06:35.678 --> 06:37.513
I mean, is this what's
been bothering you?

06:37.546 --> 06:38.681
Is this what's been...

06:39.148 --> 06:40.916
- No.
- Inside?

06:40.950 --> 06:44.954
I know that it, have you
talked to Dr. Martinez?

06:44.987 --> 06:47.523
Have you talked about it enough?

06:48.490 --> 06:49.558
Do your friends know?

06:56.498 --> 06:57.132
Dad.

06:59.668 --> 07:00.502
Aye.

07:12.948 --> 07:14.817
We love you unconditionally.

07:17.686 --> 07:18.687
I want you to know...

07:19.722 --> 07:21.023
I want you to know that,

07:22.591 --> 07:23.759
to understand that,

07:26.929 --> 07:31.634
with unconditional love
comes unconditional fear.

07:36.772 --> 07:41.810
Just promise me that
you will be safe, huh?

07:41.844 --> 07:42.645
Okay.

07:43.679 --> 07:44.179
Yes.

07:46.582 --> 07:47.082
Okay.

07:50.886 --> 07:55.858
And I must say that
there is a very cute boy...

07:55.891 --> 07:57.860
Ah, Yomi, please.

07:57.893 --> 08:00.029
- No, I must say, he's-
- Leave the boy alone.

08:05.935 --> 08:07.202
Woo!

08:15.945 --> 08:16.845
Hey.

08:16.879 --> 08:18.580
Dude,
it's my birthday.

08:18.614 --> 08:19.648
I know.

08:19.682 --> 08:20.849
Look I know,

08:20.883 --> 08:21.817
but I'm the worst,
I'm the worst,

08:21.850 --> 08:22.885
but I did it.

08:24.053 --> 08:26.555
I came out.

08:26.588 --> 08:28.090
Baby,
get off the phone.

08:30.759 --> 08:31.660
Are you there?

08:32.294 --> 08:33.128
Yeah.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.965
All right, I'll
see you in a minute.

08:57.853 --> 08:59.488
Fuck!

09:11.967 --> 09:13.135
Fuck.

09:14.903 --> 09:16.205
Go ahead and turn
that music down, please?

09:16.238 --> 09:17.139
Right, yeah.

09:21.076 --> 09:23.812
I'm just gonna let the
window down for him.

09:23.846 --> 09:25.914
Okay,
after you do that,

09:25.948 --> 09:27.616
license and registration.

09:27.649 --> 09:29.051
Sure, it's in my
glove box, can I...?

09:29.084 --> 09:30.219
Yep, go ahead.

09:31.053 --> 09:31.887
Hey, move slow.

09:41.964 --> 09:45.300
- Tundee? How do you say?
- It's Tunde, actually.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.969
Tunde, where's that from?

09:47.002 --> 09:48.971
My parents are from Nigeria.

09:49.004 --> 09:50.806
Nigeria, huh?

09:50.839 --> 09:51.874
Hey Callahan, did I
ever tell you that story

09:51.907 --> 09:54.043
about that Nigerian prince
that kept emailing me?

09:54.076 --> 09:55.144
Yeah.

09:55.177 --> 09:55.844
If I gave him like
a thousand bucks,

09:55.878 --> 09:56.812
he said he'd give me a million.

09:57.046 --> 09:57.946
- Nothing happened.
- Yeah.

09:57.980 --> 09:59.148
Did you get the million?

09:59.181 --> 10:00.182
Tunde, you know
anything about that?

10:00.215 --> 10:01.116
I'm kinda late for something.

10:01.150 --> 10:02.751
Oh shit, Tunde's late.

10:02.785 --> 10:04.887
Callahan, Tunde's late.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.123
Tunde, Tupac, that's like a...

10:08.157 --> 10:09.758
that could be like
a rapper name, no?

10:10.826 --> 10:11.427
Are you a rapper?

10:11.461 --> 10:12.161
- I'm not a rapper.
- No?

10:12.194 --> 10:13.228
No.

10:13.262 --> 10:14.963
That's some pretty serious
bling on those knuckles

10:14.997 --> 10:17.366
- for not being a rapper.
- Jesus Christ.

10:17.399 --> 10:18.667
Look at that watch.

10:19.469 --> 10:20.669
Are you sure you're
not a rapper?

10:20.702 --> 10:21.970
Where'd you get that watch?

10:22.971 --> 10:23.739
From my mom.

10:24.273 --> 10:25.707
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

10:25.741 --> 10:28.010
What'd your
mom give you, Callahan?

10:28.043 --> 10:29.945
Will you not flash
that light in my eye?

10:29.978 --> 10:30.813
Yeah?

10:31.481 --> 10:33.082
Guys, I'm really late.

10:33.115 --> 10:34.283
I just...

10:34.316 --> 10:36.118
- Callahan, Tunde's late, man.
- Did I do something wrong?

10:38.187 --> 10:39.922
Did I do something wrong,
I mean I...

10:40.189 --> 10:41.957
Over here real quick, Tunde.

10:41.990 --> 10:43.125
You inebriated pal?

10:43.560 --> 10:46.395
No, I'm not inebriated.

10:46.428 --> 10:49.098
I mean, I suffer from
allergies maybe that's what...

10:49.131 --> 10:51.967
Ok, Tunde, I'm
just gonna need you

10:52.000 --> 10:53.335
to step out of the car.

10:55.003 --> 10:56.405
Listen, if it's a ticket,
like I'll take it.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.107
I'll take the ticket.
If it's a ticket...

10:58.575 --> 10:59.975
Don't make an issue of this.

11:01.076 --> 11:02.077
Okay?

11:02.111 --> 11:03.245
Make it
easy, buddy, come on. Okay?

11:03.278 --> 11:05.114
- Be fast.
- Okay, okay.

11:09.051 --> 11:10.285
Keep your hands where
I could see them.

11:15.023 --> 11:15.858
Slow.

11:28.103 --> 11:28.937
The light is bright.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.974
I know. Are you sure you haven't
had anything to drink

11:32.007 --> 11:32.908
or smoke tonight?

11:32.941 --> 11:33.976
No, I'm telling you
it's from allergies.

11:34.009 --> 11:35.210
I've I haven't smoked.

11:35.244 --> 11:36.745
I don't drink, like no.

11:36.778 --> 11:37.946
- The red eyes...
- Allergies.

11:37.980 --> 11:38.947
Are you
sure about that?

11:38.981 --> 11:39.915
Yes, I'm sure.

11:40.517 --> 11:41.817
Nothing to drink?

11:42.784 --> 11:44.019
Yeah.

11:44.052 --> 11:45.220
I promise.

11:45.522 --> 11:46.321
All right.

11:47.723 --> 11:48.790
I'm gonna run this.

11:48.824 --> 11:49.526
I'll be back in one second.

11:49.559 --> 11:50.959
- Just stay here, okay?
- Yeah.

11:51.927 --> 11:53.162
Let's hurry,
I'm fucking hungry, man.

11:53.195 --> 11:54.229
Oh, relax.

11:54.531 --> 11:56.064
You're always fucking hungry.

11:56.098 --> 11:57.199
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:57.232 --> 11:58.734
Fuck Soren.

11:58.767 --> 12:00.736
Gun!

12:02.738 --> 12:04.106
You saw him reach,
he fucking reached.

12:04.139 --> 12:04.973
Oh, fuck. Call an ambulance.

12:05.207 --> 12:06.074
Jesus.

12:27.095 --> 12:27.930
Damn.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.910
Babatunde
Adesola Johnson was born

12:41.944 --> 12:43.779
on December 30th, 2002

12:43.812 --> 12:46.248
to Adesola Jonson
and Yomi Okafor

12:46.281 --> 12:48.217
in Lagos, Nigeria.

12:48.250 --> 12:51.053
On the night of May 28th, 2020,

12:51.086 --> 12:52.988
Tunde Johnson departed this life

12:53.021 --> 12:55.757
at 9:38 PM at the hands
of police officers

12:55.791 --> 12:57.460
in Los Angeles, California.

13:17.946 --> 13:18.880
Morning honey.

13:19.114 --> 13:19.915
Morning.

13:21.116 --> 13:23.118
- Morning.
- Morning.

13:25.053 --> 13:27.222
An examination of death,

13:29.858 --> 13:31.326
modernity, hmm...

13:33.061 --> 13:33.795
Mom.

13:35.197 --> 13:36.798
You're my favorite son, sue me.

13:36.832 --> 13:38.066
I'm your only son.

13:38.934 --> 13:41.136
Have you seen your
father's new piece?

13:47.376 --> 13:49.177
Oh, sorry, I was...

13:50.345 --> 13:52.180
Distracted?

13:52.214 --> 13:53.982
Let me guess,

13:54.016 --> 13:56.084
it is
a riveting essay

13:56.118 --> 13:57.587
on post-millennial

13:57.620 --> 13:59.121
tribal scarification.

14:02.391 --> 14:03.959
That was last week.

14:04.527 --> 14:07.195
Though, in terms of self parody,

14:07.229 --> 14:10.065
I do think I have
outdone myself.

14:15.137 --> 14:18.173
I'd say my trip back
home was a success.

14:23.546 --> 14:25.314
The rest premiers
tomorrow evening.

14:26.516 --> 14:28.884
I was thinking we could
make a night of it.

14:30.319 --> 14:32.622
Grab some dinner,
hit the gallery.

14:32.655 --> 14:35.324
Maybe see a movie.

14:37.627 --> 14:41.229
You should invite Marley.

14:41.597 --> 14:43.999
- Yomi.
- No, shh shh.

14:45.501 --> 14:48.203
We understand that you
are becoming a man, Tunde.

14:48.604 --> 14:50.005
Are you hearing this?

14:50.038 --> 14:51.206
And if you
are sexually active.

14:51.239 --> 14:52.407
Dad, please!

14:52.441 --> 14:54.142
No, if you're going to
engage in adult behavior,

14:54.176 --> 14:56.144
then you need to act like one.

14:56.178 --> 14:58.013
Okay? Tut, tut, tut. Ah ah.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.283
No glove, no love.

15:01.551 --> 15:02.984
I'm too young to be
anyone's grandmother.

15:03.018 --> 15:04.186
You know what,

15:05.187 --> 15:08.323
you, you're on to something.

15:08.357 --> 15:09.625
After that speech,

15:09.659 --> 15:12.528
I don't think I'll have
sex with anyone ever.

15:13.962 --> 15:17.299
You are loved and
respected.

15:20.202 --> 15:21.970
Ade.

15:22.003 --> 15:23.238
Oh, yeah.

15:25.608 --> 15:28.343
You're valued, and you're
safe in this place.

15:34.015 --> 15:35.951
Now boys,

15:35.984 --> 15:38.454
I think you all know what
time of the year it is.

15:38.488 --> 15:39.321
Oh yes.

15:39.354 --> 15:42.023
It's our boy's
motherfucking birthday.

15:42.057 --> 15:43.091
- Ow!
- Oh shit, sorry, your

15:43.125 --> 15:44.393
shoulder. I'm sorry, man.
Do you need something?

15:44.426 --> 15:45.193
I got something for you.

15:45.227 --> 15:46.496
I'm good, just sit down.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.163
Anyway, as I was saying.

15:49.030 --> 15:51.400
My birthday means
my birthday party,

15:51.433 --> 15:56.004
AKA the swankiest,
fucking rager of the year!

15:56.839 --> 15:58.641
And that means,
you do the honors.

16:00.442 --> 16:02.444
As was written in the Bible...

16:02.478 --> 16:04.112
- Bottles!
- What?

16:04.146 --> 16:05.180
- Models.
- What?

16:05.213 --> 16:08.049
And enough drugs to keep
your shriveled dicks hard.

16:09.619 --> 16:10.352
That was one time.

16:10.385 --> 16:11.420
Come on.

16:37.112 --> 16:38.581
So we read Deadline, obviously.

16:38.614 --> 16:40.248
A Freeform pilot?

16:41.116 --> 16:42.585
I'm just a side character,
someone's girlfriend,

16:42.618 --> 16:45.220
but yeah, it's good.

16:45.253 --> 16:46.421
We got you something.

16:50.058 --> 16:51.393
Chocolate?

16:51.426 --> 16:52.360
I book a fucking job

16:52.394 --> 16:53.763
and you buy me chocolate.

16:53.796 --> 16:54.764
I'm sorry.

16:54.797 --> 16:56.264
That was stupid.

16:57.399 --> 16:58.501
Well, I'm starving.

16:58.534 --> 17:00.368
Honey, we all are.

17:02.204 --> 17:03.438
- Right?
- Yeah.

17:04.474 --> 17:05.508
Oh my God.

17:05.541 --> 17:07.477
He's like staring.

17:10.813 --> 17:12.648
Yeah. Of course he is.

17:25.193 --> 17:27.697
What the fuck are
you wearing, huh?

17:27.730 --> 17:28.931
Jesus Christ.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.398
Every day is like a fucking
Beyonce concert with this kid.

17:30.432 --> 17:31.467
Charlie, stop being an asshole.

17:31.501 --> 17:32.602
What?

17:32.635 --> 17:33.503
Charlie, leave him alone.

17:33.536 --> 17:35.437
He's got a mohair bag.

17:36.438 --> 17:38.508
He looks like Blade.

17:38.541 --> 17:40.141
- Vampire hunter!
- Charlie, leave him alone.

17:40.175 --> 17:41.343
See you later, Wesley.

17:43.311 --> 17:44.145
Solange.

18:07.703 --> 18:09.672
He is like so hot.

18:15.711 --> 18:17.345
When do you think we're
going to be official,

18:17.379 --> 18:18.514
like official, official?

18:19.582 --> 18:21.249
I mean, I did let him
fuck me without a condom.

18:21.283 --> 18:22.652
I feel like that
counts for something.

18:23.719 --> 18:26.656
One, you're so fucking gross.

18:26.689 --> 18:27.657
And two...

18:27.690 --> 18:30.826
I would be careful with
the rest of your list.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.428
Like, the English language
is like, vast mushy,

18:33.462 --> 18:36.465
like, use like, and
like every sentence.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.234
I love you.

18:39.267 --> 18:41.537
Well, like I assume that
a person of your sexual...

18:41.571 --> 18:43.238
Marley.

18:43.271 --> 18:44.372
Come on, Tunde.

18:44.406 --> 18:46.174
It's the 21st century.

18:46.207 --> 18:47.275
Everyone's gay.

18:47.309 --> 18:48.544
Oh, you got
something to tell me?

18:50.513 --> 18:52.247
You know, you're really
cute when you're happy.

18:53.916 --> 18:54.884
Yeah.

18:54.917 --> 18:55.818
Are you hitting on me

18:55.851 --> 18:57.620
'cause you know my
parents would love that.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.790
One, not since middle school,

19:00.823 --> 19:02.792
and two,

19:02.825 --> 19:05.561
it would behoove you
to tell your parents.

19:07.162 --> 19:08.497
I don't like secrets, Tunde.

19:13.201 --> 19:14.737
I love you.

19:14.971 --> 19:15.805
Love you too.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.620
The end of the
400 Blows has been

19:30.653 --> 19:34.490
a source of contention

19:34.523 --> 19:37.760
between critics and
cinephiles alike.

19:42.665 --> 19:44.634
My favorite interpretation

19:44.667 --> 19:49.437
comes from Arlene Croach,
Film Quarterly Review.

19:49.472 --> 19:50.438
I wanna fuck you.

19:55.377 --> 19:56.779
She...

19:56.812 --> 20:00.148
she notes that, um,

20:00.549 --> 20:03.719
Antoine's freeze frame stare...

20:07.657 --> 20:08.457
Tunde?

20:09.825 --> 20:10.893
Tunde, are you all right?

20:13.529 --> 20:14.864
Um, she,

20:14.897 --> 20:18.233
she encapsulates this
quite remarkably in a,

20:18.266 --> 20:19.568
a single quote.

20:22.538 --> 20:23.405
In the end,

20:23.438 --> 20:25.206
you are no longer
looking at the film,

20:27.610 --> 20:30.513
the film is looking at you.

20:32.615 --> 20:34.717
Thank you, Tunde.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.317
Sydnee, you're up next.

21:04.914 --> 21:06.682
Benzodiazepines.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.586
The most prescribed
drug class in America.

21:16.759 --> 21:19.762
When you take too
much, you hallucinate.

21:27.002 --> 21:28.871
When you're in withdrawal,

21:28.904 --> 21:30.606
you hallucinate.

21:38.614 --> 21:40.516
When reality hurts,
you numb the pain.

22:28.531 --> 22:30.833
Just waiting for my
husband to return from war.

22:33.969 --> 22:35.504
Whoo.

22:37.039 --> 22:39.875
Next thing you know,
you'll be wearing my skin.

22:40.142 --> 22:41.710
Ooh, kinky.

22:42.711 --> 22:44.814
Maybe then you'll
be waiting for me.

22:44.847 --> 22:45.748
Oh.

22:48.383 --> 22:50.653
- You're so dark.
- I know, I love it.

23:07.002 --> 23:08.470
Wait, stop.

23:09.939 --> 23:10.739
What?

23:25.888 --> 23:26.989
May I?

23:39.034 --> 23:41.003
Look, what was I supposed to do?

23:42.838 --> 23:44.573
What were
you supposed to do?

23:44.607 --> 23:45.908
Yeah, if I didn't
go along, dude she...

23:45.941 --> 23:47.977
she'd know something was up.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.945
What were you supposed to do?

23:50.212 --> 23:52.114
I have
appearances to maintain.

23:52.147 --> 23:53.682
You're supposed to
stop fucking her.

23:53.716 --> 23:55.416
- Oh my...
- I know!

24:17.072 --> 24:17.873
You okay?

24:23.579 --> 24:24.113
Soren.

24:25.948 --> 24:28.517
I hurt it this morning
during practice.

24:36.892 --> 24:37.893
Sit back.

24:38.894 --> 24:39.728
Let me see.

24:41.597 --> 24:42.831
Easy.

24:49.171 --> 24:50.005
What?

24:51.507 --> 24:52.775
Do you want to come out?

24:54.009 --> 24:54.877
Tonight?

25:04.019 --> 25:04.887
Yeah.

25:46.295 --> 25:47.162
Like for tonight,

25:48.263 --> 25:50.733
my place first, or yours?

25:59.108 --> 26:00.175
Mine, definitely.

26:10.052 --> 26:14.056
Before, or like,
or the after party?

26:20.195 --> 26:22.264
During, I think.

26:26.969 --> 26:28.871
You think.

26:36.178 --> 26:37.212
You know my dad.

26:39.615 --> 26:41.984
I'll just need a couple of
rounds of liquid courage.

26:46.655 --> 26:47.756
It'll be fine.

26:53.962 --> 26:55.264
I'll do my parents tomorrow.

27:02.404 --> 27:03.205
Hey.

27:06.108 --> 27:07.042
What are you doing?

27:13.348 --> 27:14.149
Come over.

27:29.164 --> 27:30.132
First of all,

27:30.165 --> 27:32.000
I'm gonna need you to go
ahead and put that out.

27:33.302 --> 27:34.369
I hate to break this up guys,

27:34.403 --> 27:36.338
but this area is off limits.
So I'm gonna need you

27:36.371 --> 27:37.940
to pack up and join the
rest of civilization.

27:37.973 --> 27:38.807
Okay.

27:38.841 --> 27:40.976
No problem, we were just
leaving anyway.

27:42.211 --> 27:42.945
Leaving?

27:43.979 --> 27:45.080
Where you you rushing off to?

27:46.248 --> 27:48.951
Oh, it's a little
trouble in paradise.

27:48.984 --> 27:50.385
He's cute when he
gets mad at you.

27:51.987 --> 27:53.055
How long have y'all
been together?

27:53.088 --> 27:54.990
Wow, you are inquisitive.

27:55.023 --> 27:56.925
Oh, that's a nice S.A.T. word,

27:57.860 --> 27:58.961
something you should
have learned in school

27:58.994 --> 27:59.962
where you should be right now.

27:59.995 --> 28:01.730
Right, okay, all
right, we're leaving.

28:01.763 --> 28:02.831
Okay, pack it up.

28:02.865 --> 28:04.266
And I do not want to see
you over here smoking again.

28:04.467 --> 28:05.300
Yes, ma'am.

28:06.902 --> 28:07.736
Sorry.

28:08.303 --> 28:09.371
Yes ma'am, thanks.

28:13.275 --> 28:14.309
Stay in school.

28:21.950 --> 28:22.417
What?

28:24.119 --> 28:25.954
Just really glad you're here.

28:28.857 --> 28:30.292
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:31.793 --> 28:32.661
I gotta pee.

29:18.508 --> 29:19.942
Fuck, Marley.

29:28.484 --> 29:29.885
Did I do something wrong?

29:36.258 --> 29:37.092
I just,

29:38.961 --> 29:39.761
I got a lot

29:40.996 --> 29:42.130
going on

29:42.164 --> 29:44.199
with the game and with my dad.

29:44.233 --> 29:45.167
I'm sorry.

29:45.801 --> 29:46.935
Come here.

29:58.447 --> 29:59.448
It'll be okay.

30:04.152 --> 30:06.054
I just need you.

30:33.148 --> 30:34.082
So
we bumped you up

30:34.116 --> 30:35.585
to four milligrams a day,

30:35.618 --> 30:39.187
one single pill to be taken
in the morning and evening.

30:39.221 --> 30:40.889
How's it working out for you?

30:42.357 --> 30:43.325
Uh, great.

30:43.660 --> 30:45.394
Glad to hear it.

30:45.427 --> 30:48.997
I'd like to revisit a discussion
from our previous session.

30:49.031 --> 30:54.069
You expressed worry about the
transient nature of things,

30:54.436 --> 30:56.371
"how the future, once
looming and distant,

30:56.405 --> 30:58.508
appears to be staring
me right in the face."

30:59.908 --> 31:01.310
I should put that
in my dream journal.

31:01.343 --> 31:03.579
You didn't tell me you
have a dream journal.

31:03.613 --> 31:05.180
I don't.

31:08.250 --> 31:09.251
What worries you?

31:16.459 --> 31:17.460
Uh, change.

31:18.327 --> 31:20.128
Go on.

31:20.162 --> 31:22.532
I guess when you spend your
whole life in one place

31:22.565 --> 31:23.999
with the same group of people,

31:24.032 --> 31:26.435
you start to think that
your loop of experiences

31:26.469 --> 31:27.969
are all that there is.

31:28.937 --> 31:31.006
And then you turn 18 and
you go off to college

31:31.039 --> 31:33.208
and it's like, none
of it ever happened.

31:34.209 --> 31:35.010
Like,

31:38.347 --> 31:41.416
it wasn't important
or real or, like, um...

31:41.450 --> 31:43.051
And how is this
affecting you and Soren?

31:48.223 --> 31:49.358
We're coming out tonight.

31:50.626 --> 31:52.260
That's
all you ever wanted.

31:56.298 --> 31:57.366
Yeah.

31:57.399 --> 31:58.501
That's all I ever wanted.

32:11.046 --> 32:12.381
And when
faced with that,

32:12.414 --> 32:14.449
whether white, black, or green.

32:14.484 --> 32:15.618
Where are these green people

32:15.651 --> 32:17.419
being shot by the police?

32:17.453 --> 32:20.122
The fact is in 2017,

32:20.155 --> 32:22.124
black males, and
not green people,

32:22.157 --> 32:24.126
accounted for
22% of all people

32:24.159 --> 32:25.927
shot and killed by police.

32:25.961 --> 32:27.530
So Marley comes up to me today.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.433
And...

32:32.367 --> 32:36.639
she just kinda presses
her finger into my chest.

32:36.672 --> 32:38.306
And she's all,

32:40.242 --> 32:41.209
"it would behoove you

32:41.243 --> 32:42.578
to tell your parents...

32:46.649 --> 32:49.418
It would behoove you to tell
your parents that you're gay.

32:49.451 --> 32:51.521
Who, Mr. O'Connor?

32:51.554 --> 32:53.656
Who would they
protect and serve?

32:54.423 --> 32:56.224
Well, according
to the bureau of justice...

32:56.258 --> 32:57.325
Ta-da.

32:57.359 --> 32:57.993
...African Americans
are responsible

32:58.026 --> 32:59.961
for almost 52% of homicides

32:59.995 --> 33:02.364
nationwide since the 1980s.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.366
Have you ever
heard of the war on drugs?

33:04.399 --> 33:05.635
Oh honey.

33:05.668 --> 33:06.502
Oh baby.

33:07.135 --> 33:08.437
Mom, mom.

33:08.471 --> 33:09.472
- We talked about this.
- Okay, okay.

33:09.505 --> 33:10.473
Okay, okay, yes.

33:10.506 --> 33:11.206
Yes.

33:11.574 --> 33:12.508
Have you talked to Dr. Martinez?

33:12.542 --> 33:13.476
Have you talked to anybody?

33:15.343 --> 33:16.679
Uh...

33:17.312 --> 33:20.081
Okay.

33:20.115 --> 33:21.484
We love you honey.

33:21.517 --> 33:22.317
We love you.

33:26.522 --> 33:27.355
Dad.

33:35.565 --> 33:37.567
We love you unconditionally.

33:40.603 --> 33:42.404
I want you to know that.

33:44.172 --> 33:46.208
But with unconditional
love comes

33:46.241 --> 33:48.009
- unconditional fear.
- Unconditional fear.

33:50.445 --> 33:52.482
Nobody's arguing
with you on that level.

34:03.091 --> 34:03.992
Hey.

34:04.226 --> 34:05.093
Dude, it's my birthday.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.562
I know, I know,

34:06.596 --> 34:08.464
but I did it, Soren.

34:08.498 --> 34:09.397
I came out.

34:10.633 --> 34:11.399
Now it's just you.

34:14.604 --> 34:15.437
Baby.

34:15.471 --> 34:16.472
Hey.

34:16.506 --> 34:18.006
Get off the phone.

34:18.741 --> 34:20.375
Hey, you there?

34:32.087 --> 34:33.489
You sure you haven't
had anything to drink?

34:49.237 --> 34:49.839
Gun!

34:58.848 --> 35:00.081
Oh fuck.

35:03.653 --> 35:06.187
Babatunde
Adesola Johnson was born

35:07.188 --> 35:09.559
on December 30th, 2002
to Adesola Johnson

35:09.592 --> 35:12.360
and Yomi Okafor
in Lagos, Nigeria.

35:12.394 --> 35:14.597
Yo, Charlie. Whatup?

35:14.630 --> 35:16.699
His parents and
friends called him Tunde.

35:18.601 --> 35:21.737
Tunde attended Saint Ambrose
Preparatory Academy.

35:23.639 --> 35:26.542
On the night of May 28th, 2020,

35:26.576 --> 35:28.343
Tunde Johnson departed this life

35:28.376 --> 35:31.246
at 9:38 p.m. at the
hands of police officers

35:31.279 --> 35:32.615
in Los Angeles, California.

35:33.816 --> 35:36.619
Did you see your
father's new piece?

35:36.652 --> 35:37.820
Remarkable, isn't it?

35:38.320 --> 35:39.789
The rest premieres
tomorrow evening.

35:44.159 --> 35:46.796
Stuff of nightmares, I know.

35:46.829 --> 35:49.397
Remember the masquerades
back home, Yomi?

35:49.431 --> 35:51.601
Ah! All too well.

35:51.901 --> 35:53.736
But you've made it
more contemporary.

35:54.837 --> 35:58.841
Imagine the streets lined
up with these creatures,

35:58.874 --> 36:00.442
ancestors simultaneously,

36:00.476 --> 36:02.310
dead and alive.

36:02.344 --> 36:03.813
So, zombies?

36:04.446 --> 36:05.514
More like...

36:05.548 --> 36:06.348
Ghosts.

36:07.349 --> 36:09.652
Our people don't believe
in traditional death.

36:14.557 --> 36:16.358
It's been so long.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.561
I seem to have forgotten.

36:28.671 --> 36:29.437
Really?

36:31.641 --> 36:33.441
I will no longer die.

36:33.476 --> 36:36.646
I have become 200 hills

36:36.679 --> 36:38.848
rolled into one.

36:38.881 --> 36:40.683
I am immovable.

36:41.817 --> 36:45.420
Death is but a transition
from this life to the next.

36:57.733 --> 36:59.468
What are you wearing?

36:59.502 --> 37:00.703
Jesus Christ.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.472
Every day, like a fucking
Beyonce concert with this guy.

37:03.506 --> 37:04.674
Right?

37:04.707 --> 37:05.808
Put a ring on it.

37:05.841 --> 37:07.743
Charlie, stop being an asshole.

37:08.811 --> 37:09.478
Okay.

37:09.512 --> 37:10.780
Charlie, leave him alone, man.

37:11.346 --> 37:12.748
Whoa, sorry.

37:12.782 --> 37:14.349
He looks like Blade.

37:14.382 --> 37:15.283
I like it.

37:16.251 --> 37:17.553
Protect us from the
vampires please.

37:46.281 --> 37:46.882
Tunde.

37:48.718 --> 37:49.752
Tunde.

37:50.519 --> 37:52.621
He is like so hot.

37:52.655 --> 37:54.355
When do you think we're
going to be official?

37:55.356 --> 37:57.626
Like official, official?

37:58.828 --> 37:59.729
Marls, I...

38:01.697 --> 38:02.832
I don't think that's
going to happen.

38:03.165 --> 38:04.600
You don't know that.

38:06.902 --> 38:08.269
Did he say something to you?

38:10.305 --> 38:11.874
I just, I want to know if
he said something to you.

38:11.907 --> 38:13.809
We gotta get to class, come on.

38:13.843 --> 38:15.845
Like you give a shit.

38:15.878 --> 38:17.445
I'm a big girl, I can handle it.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.715
He doesn't treat
you right, Marley.

38:22.885 --> 38:24.487
No one deserves to be a secret.

38:25.788 --> 38:27.322
I'm not a secret.

38:31.894 --> 38:33.796
Do you think he's
seeing someone else?

38:35.464 --> 38:36.031
I don't know.

38:36.331 --> 38:37.900
I mean, that'd be fine.

38:37.933 --> 38:39.034
It's not like we're in love.

38:39.935 --> 38:41.904
We just fuck sometimes.

38:41.937 --> 38:43.773
I think guys are dumb.

38:43.806 --> 38:44.840
He's so dumb.

38:50.913 --> 38:52.815
Do you think I'm a good person?

38:53.816 --> 38:54.950
Of course I do.

38:54.984 --> 38:56.284
I mean I try.

38:57.052 --> 38:58.353
You know?

38:59.488 --> 39:00.288
Fuck.

39:01.690 --> 39:03.726
Sometimes I attract
really shitty people.

39:03.759 --> 39:05.360
It's not you, Marley.

39:05.393 --> 39:06.595
No, but what if it is?

39:06.629 --> 39:08.597
What if it's my fault?

39:08.631 --> 39:09.899
What if there's
something wrong with me?

39:09.932 --> 39:11.432
You're perfect.

39:23.045 --> 39:23.879
Come on.

39:25.848 --> 39:26.849
We gotta get to class.

39:37.760 --> 39:38.894
Hey.

39:38.928 --> 39:40.361
- Love you.
- Love you too.

39:40.395 --> 39:42.631
All right, class,
let's settle down.

39:43.165 --> 39:44.567
Tunde, you're up first.

40:01.750 --> 40:03.451
Yeah, I hurt it during practice.

40:07.089 --> 40:09.892
They're gonna strap me
up for the game tonight.

40:09.925 --> 40:11.961
Turn me into a fucking cyborg.

40:12.595 --> 40:14.897
Be a third of our way into
forming The Justice League.

40:15.130 --> 40:17.800
I'm guessing you're
Batman in this situation?

40:28.944 --> 40:29.778
Obviously.

40:36.952 --> 40:38.654
Maybe you should
sit this one out.

40:42.691 --> 40:44.093
Nah, I made a commitment.

40:45.761 --> 40:46.829
You're coming, right?

40:49.832 --> 40:50.633
Therapy.

40:52.968 --> 40:53.969
Yep.

40:56.038 --> 40:58.474
Neither is my pop's.

41:01.710 --> 41:02.978
He's missed every
fucking game this year.

41:03.012 --> 41:04.546
I don't know why I even try.

41:16.091 --> 41:17.059
You look like shit.

41:19.094 --> 41:19.895
Yeah.

41:22.564 --> 41:24.166
Withdrawal's a bitch.

41:24.199 --> 41:26.936
Well you're not supposed
to quit cold turkey.

41:28.837 --> 41:29.638
You know?

41:32.007 --> 41:33.475
You need to do a lesser drug.

41:35.945 --> 41:37.146
Ease your way out.

42:00.269 --> 42:01.470
What?

42:03.305 --> 42:05.007
She's my best friend, Soren.

42:06.041 --> 42:07.009
She's my best friend,

42:07.042 --> 42:08.243
and you're hurting her,

42:08.277 --> 42:09.311
and I watch you
hurt her every day.

42:09.345 --> 42:11.947
- And I don't want to.
- I'm sorry, okay?

42:11.981 --> 42:13.248
I just...

42:13.282 --> 42:15.017
I worry about what
it would look like,

42:15.050 --> 42:18.053
and how people would
treat me if they knew,

42:18.087 --> 42:19.088
if they,

42:19.955 --> 42:20.923
if they saw me.

42:20.956 --> 42:21.991
I see you.

42:26.695 --> 42:27.696
And I love you.

42:28.030 --> 42:29.999
That's not, that doesn't change

42:30.032 --> 42:30.933
- the way that other people...
- Listen.

42:30.966 --> 42:31.967
You are enough.

42:47.182 --> 42:49.284
And a little extra.

42:49.318 --> 42:51.020
Fuck off.

42:52.855 --> 42:53.522
Ow.

42:53.856 --> 42:55.891
Two questions.

42:57.893 --> 42:58.861
Hmm.

42:59.895 --> 43:01.563
You all right?

43:01.897 --> 43:03.032
Hey.

43:16.211 --> 43:17.613
You okay?

44:05.294 --> 44:08.297
Feeling better?

44:10.299 --> 44:11.133
Yeah.

44:12.768 --> 44:13.602
Told you.

44:18.273 --> 44:19.074
I had this...

44:22.277 --> 44:23.245
I had this cousin, right?

44:24.379 --> 44:25.380
This dope athlete,

44:26.315 --> 44:27.850
he was a soccer player.

44:29.218 --> 44:31.820
And he starts doing heroin,

44:34.189 --> 44:35.023
and then...

44:35.057 --> 44:36.358
I'm not doing heroin.

44:38.293 --> 44:40.095
Dude, I know you're
not doing heroin.

44:41.797 --> 44:42.331
But, look, anyway...

44:45.234 --> 44:46.168
He, uh...

44:47.703 --> 44:49.671
one day he's like,
"I'm going to quit."

44:49.705 --> 44:50.973
You know, mind over matter...

44:51.006 --> 44:53.108
You know, this
doesn't really relate.

44:55.377 --> 44:59.414
I mean, Xanax is
fully an opiate.

44:59.681 --> 45:02.718
Wait, wait.

45:02.751 --> 45:05.821
Dude, did you like find
that on what, Instachat?

45:05.854 --> 45:06.788
'Cause it's wrong.

45:08.223 --> 45:10.259
Xanax isn't an
opiate, it's a benzo.

45:33.248 --> 45:34.316
You done with that?

45:36.018 --> 45:37.487
She texted me, Tunde.

45:37.520 --> 45:38.387
No, don't.

45:38.621 --> 45:40.088
- I didn't do anything.
- No, don't.

45:40.122 --> 45:40.989
Don't.

45:42.224 --> 45:43.058
Okay.

45:44.226 --> 45:45.294
Can we just go get my car?

45:45.327 --> 45:46.161
I wanna go home.

45:47.296 --> 45:48.096
Seriously?

45:48.297 --> 45:49.731
Yeah.

45:50.098 --> 45:51.099
All right.

45:51.433 --> 45:52.301
Let's switch then.

45:54.236 --> 45:55.804
Fuck, cops.

45:55.837 --> 45:56.905
Put your seatbelt on.

46:02.545 --> 46:03.345
It's okay, all right.

46:03.378 --> 46:04.146
I got this.

46:05.515 --> 46:08.518
What seems to be the
problem, officers?

46:08.551 --> 46:10.319
License
and registration.

46:10.352 --> 46:11.987
Hang on a sec, we didn't,

46:12.020 --> 46:13.355
we didn't do anything wrong.

46:13.388 --> 46:14.223
Sir, I'm talking to your friend.

46:14.256 --> 46:15.891
I understand that. But this is
my car...

46:15.924 --> 46:16.959
License and
registration please.

46:16.992 --> 46:19.361
...we weren't even driving.
So, what's the problem?

46:19.394 --> 46:20.162
Sir, have you been smoking?

46:20.195 --> 46:21.531
No, I haven't been,

46:21.564 --> 46:22.397
we have not been smoking.

46:22.431 --> 46:23.332
It's fine, calm down.

46:23.365 --> 46:24.399
Are there drugs in the car?

46:24.433 --> 46:25.501
There aren't any,

46:25.535 --> 46:27.169
there are no drugs in the car.

46:27.202 --> 46:28.770
Okay, sir, step out of the car.

46:28.804 --> 46:31.373
Okay, okay.
We were just leaving.

46:31.406 --> 46:33.308
- Step out of the car.
- Look, I know my rights.

46:33.342 --> 46:34.477
You're not going
anywhere.

46:34.510 --> 46:35.478
This is ridiculous,
this is outta line.

46:35.511 --> 46:36.178
You're outta line.

46:36.211 --> 46:37.346
Sir, step out of the car now.

46:37.379 --> 46:38.814
Keep your hands where I can see.

46:38.847 --> 46:39.948
- You're on video, lady.
- Okay, okay.

46:39.982 --> 46:41.651
- I get that.
- Okay, I'm just gonna,

46:41.684 --> 46:42.518
I'm just gonna reach for my seat
belt... I need you to put that phone down...

46:42.552 --> 46:44.587
I'm just gonna
get my seatbelt.

46:44.621 --> 46:46.288
- You step out of the car.
- Look, I know my rights.

46:46.321 --> 46:47.490
You have to have a reason.

46:47.523 --> 46:49.024
Sir, I need you to step
out of the car now.

46:49.057 --> 46:50.192
Keep your hands
where I can see them

46:50.225 --> 46:52.261
- and step out of the car.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

46:52.294 --> 46:53.195
Stop talking and get
out of the car now.

46:53.228 --> 46:54.796
Okay, I'm just gonna,

46:54.830 --> 46:55.864
I'm gonna move my seatbelt.

46:55.897 --> 46:56.865
I can't move.

46:56.898 --> 47:00.135
Out of the car, now!

47:12.447 --> 47:14.383
I'm losing my mind.

47:20.456 --> 47:21.591
Babatunde
Adesola Johnson

47:21.624 --> 47:24.527
was born on December 30th, 2002

47:24.560 --> 47:26.094
to Adesola Johnson

47:26.128 --> 47:28.498
and Yomi Okafor
in Lagos, Nigeria.

47:30.432 --> 47:32.200
Tunde attended Saint
Ambrose Preparatory Academy

47:32.234 --> 47:35.505
with his childhood
friend, Marley Meyers.

47:35.538 --> 47:37.139
Tunde loved music and movies.

47:40.008 --> 47:42.478
On the afternoon
of May 28th, 2020,

47:42.512 --> 47:44.079
Tunde Johnson departed this life

47:44.112 --> 47:46.948
at 1:38 p.m. at the
hands of police officers

47:46.982 --> 47:48.551
in Playa Del Rey, California.

47:55.290 --> 47:57.392
You're acting more
morose than usual.

48:01.029 --> 48:02.097
It was a long night.

48:03.666 --> 48:04.966
Tunde, honey,

48:06.502 --> 48:09.371
I want you to know
that we trust you.

48:09.404 --> 48:11.507
I'm not
on anything.

48:12.307 --> 48:13.141
We know that.

48:14.409 --> 48:15.977
It's just that we get concerned

48:16.011 --> 48:19.615
when you seem so unsettled.

48:19.649 --> 48:21.383
Maybe it's the new medication.

48:22.585 --> 48:24.454
I'll get Dr. Martinez
on the phone.

48:24.487 --> 48:25.887
I'll sort this out.

48:25.921 --> 48:27.457
Have you ever been
stopped by the police?

48:29.459 --> 48:30.292
Yes.

48:31.960 --> 48:32.894
Did something happen?

48:32.928 --> 48:34.564
Did you get stopped
by the police, Tunde?

48:34.597 --> 48:36.164
No, ma. I'm
just saying...

48:36.198 --> 48:36.965
No, did something happen?

48:36.998 --> 48:38.066
You have to tell
us if something...

48:38.100 --> 48:39.569
- You wanna know everything.
- You have to tell us...

48:39.602 --> 48:41.471
- I keep getting pulled over!
- Okay.

48:41.504 --> 48:42.404
Well, the next
time that happens,

48:42.437 --> 48:44.172
you comply and you stay silent.

48:44.206 --> 48:45.006
I'm not always wrong.

48:45.040 --> 48:46.975
No, no, no!

48:48.478 --> 48:50.445
Your life is more
important than your pride.

48:51.614 --> 48:54.617
You do whatever it
takes to get home, safe.

48:58.454 --> 49:01.223
You stay silent and you comply.

49:22.578 --> 49:23.513
Tunde.

49:25.180 --> 49:26.081
Tunde.

49:26.381 --> 49:28.016
I can't do this again.

49:31.253 --> 49:32.455
What the fuck?

49:32.488 --> 49:34.122
What tripped me up
most about the movie

49:34.156 --> 49:35.558
was the structural conceit.

49:35.591 --> 49:39.495
I mean, how can a person
narrate an experience

49:39.529 --> 49:40.563
when they're already dead?

49:40.996 --> 49:41.831
Well, there are a lot

49:41.864 --> 49:43.733
of different narrative
styles in film.

49:43.766 --> 49:45.300
This is just one.

49:45.568 --> 49:46.401
Did you like...?

49:46.435 --> 49:49.137
No, I
didn't like anything.

49:49.171 --> 49:51.239
Do you know how much better
this film would've been

49:51.273 --> 49:53.442
if Flo Clemons was acting in it

49:53.476 --> 49:55.678
or Oscar Micheaux was directing?

49:56.445 --> 49:58.146
Because they had an
accurate portrayal

49:58.180 --> 50:00.215
of what America was then.

50:00.248 --> 50:04.252
And they haven't had their
stories told this whole time.

50:04.286 --> 50:06.254
So, no, I don't want to sit here

50:06.288 --> 50:08.356
and watch another white film...

50:23.138 --> 50:24.474
I'm
scared of falling asleep.

50:31.481 --> 50:32.314
Why?

50:36.051 --> 50:40.656
Cause... I
don't know what's real anymore.

50:49.599 --> 50:51.132
Soren?

50:51.166 --> 50:52.067
What, what's up?

51:03.579 --> 51:06.549
Drugs sometimes make
life feel like a dream,

51:08.718 --> 51:09.819
like you ain't yourself,

51:09.852 --> 51:12.120
like you're floating on air.

51:15.758 --> 51:16.792
There's this voice,

51:18.159 --> 51:20.395
the same voice that
always goes

51:20.428 --> 51:24.399
"Hey, you're just high."

51:24.834 --> 51:26.702
But you see what you feel.

51:29.772 --> 51:30.606
It's not reality.

51:38.413 --> 51:40.115
- Soren?
- Hmm?

51:49.190 --> 51:50.693
I can't hear the voice anymore.

51:55.397 --> 51:56.799
And I'm scared.

52:09.177 --> 52:10.780
I'm really scared.

52:22.892 --> 52:24.727
Hey.

52:25.393 --> 52:26.261
Hey!

52:26.963 --> 52:28.831
When you die,
you become a scar.

52:36.304 --> 52:37.138
You all right?

52:37.673 --> 52:39.809
A chalk-drawn
outline against concrete.

52:44.947 --> 52:45.881
Hey, hey, hey.

52:47.282 --> 52:48.383
Come on, hey.

52:50.620 --> 52:52.588
A human shaped
hole in the universe.

53:00.362 --> 53:01.564
The day I met Soren,

53:01.597 --> 53:03.164
all I can remember
is that I was numb.

53:04.767 --> 53:05.668
Hey.

53:08.203 --> 53:10.806
And desperate to feel.

53:12.742 --> 53:13.676
You're all right.

53:14.710 --> 53:15.678
You're okay.

53:23.251 --> 53:25.253
You tried
to take your own life?

53:38.868 --> 53:40.803
I don't know how I got so deep.

53:50.278 --> 53:52.682
He saved me then and he's
going to save me now.

53:53.582 --> 53:55.316
What do you mean?

53:55.350 --> 53:57.385
I wouldn't have had the
courage to tell my parents

53:57.419 --> 53:58.420
if he wasn't around.

54:07.630 --> 54:08.798
I'm black and gay.

54:13.736 --> 54:15.504
And even those two
hate each other.

54:20.843 --> 54:23.813
Which means, like in
the eyes of humanity,

54:23.846 --> 54:25.514
I'm like two degrees off human.

54:27.917 --> 54:28.851
Something to,

54:31.587 --> 54:32.420
to be feared

54:34.990 --> 54:36.324
and laughed at,

54:36.357 --> 54:39.829
like this curiosity
in the corner.

54:42.865 --> 54:44.667
I should be happier
though, right?

54:46.068 --> 54:47.335
Dr. Martinez?

54:51.774 --> 54:52.875
'Cause I'm one of the
lucky ones.

54:52.908 --> 54:54.375
Like, I got a nice car,

54:57.780 --> 54:58.781
and a big house.

55:03.853 --> 55:04.887
All this stuff,

55:05.955 --> 55:08.858
supposed to make me feel
like I'm worth something?

55:10.425 --> 55:12.327
People walk right
through me, Dr. Martinez.

55:18.000 --> 55:18.968
No one sees me...

55:20.936 --> 55:21.937
except him.

55:23.371 --> 55:24.774
Soren sees all of me.

55:39.955 --> 55:41.791
And if he can do that,

55:46.829 --> 55:48.864
then he can do anything.

55:49.799 --> 55:51.934
[Alfred Well, no intelligent
person disregards

55:51.967 --> 55:54.470
the unfortunate history of
African Americans in America.

55:54.503 --> 55:56.472
Unfortunate?

55:57.773 --> 55:59.875
Misplacing your
wallet is unfortunate.

55:59.909 --> 56:03.879
The traffic in downtown
LA, that is unfortunate.

56:03.913 --> 56:06.715
The degradation,
humiliation and mutilation

56:06.749 --> 56:08.751
of black bodies in this country

56:08.784 --> 56:10.586
is not unfortunate.

56:10.619 --> 56:11.754
It's a genocide.

56:11.787 --> 56:13.756
Can I borrow your car?

56:13.789 --> 56:14.456
Nobody's
arguing with you...

56:14.490 --> 56:16.725
Tunde. Honey, I don't...

56:16.759 --> 56:17.893
I...

56:18.828 --> 56:20.996
I'm just nervous.

56:21.964 --> 56:23.732
I want to make a
good impression.

56:25.134 --> 56:26.869
Pretty please, Dad?

56:30.005 --> 56:31.473
Okay.

56:31.507 --> 56:33.441
Well, according to the Bureau
of Justice, African Americans...

56:33.475 --> 56:34.910
If you scratch my car,

56:34.944 --> 56:36.946
you will never see
that boy again.

56:36.979 --> 56:38.080
Thanks.

56:38.113 --> 56:38.914
I'll see you guys at two.

56:38.948 --> 56:40.749
No! One o'clock,
that's your curfew.

56:44.053 --> 56:45.521
What did I say?

58:12.841 --> 58:14.109
Hey, I'm not doing
anything.

58:16.745 --> 58:18.914
You're hurting me. Get off!

58:18.948 --> 58:21.684
Get off me. Please,
somebody help!

58:21.717 --> 58:23.052
Please, somebody!

58:23.085 --> 58:23.886
Please!

58:27.556 --> 58:29.224
911,
what's your emergency?

58:29.258 --> 58:30.626
Hello, yes.

58:30.659 --> 58:31.927
Can you send someone
to my neighborhood?

58:31.961 --> 58:33.162
I can hear a man.

58:33.195 --> 58:35.197
What are
you hearing, sir?

58:35.230 --> 58:36.632
I can hear a man
yelling down the street

58:36.665 --> 58:37.700
from my house.

58:37.733 --> 58:39.068
What's your address?

58:39.101 --> 58:41.837
It's, uh,
42 Douglas Court, but it's...

58:41.870 --> 58:43.238
This at your house?

58:43.272 --> 58:44.440
A couple of
blocks down from my house.

58:44.473 --> 58:46.642
Okay, can you tell
me what's happening, sir?

58:46.675 --> 58:48.243
Uh, yeah, I was
taking out the trash

58:48.277 --> 58:50.679
and I saw a man walk by...

58:50.713 --> 58:52.047
You saw a
man walking down the...

58:52.081 --> 58:53.148
Security
drove by really fast.

58:53.182 --> 58:54.683
If you could just send somebody.

58:54.717 --> 58:56.118
Can you
describe the man you saw?

58:56.151 --> 58:58.053
I don't know.
I didn't, I didn't see him.

58:58.087 --> 58:59.955
It's dark out.

59:01.223 --> 59:02.024
And your
address is 42...

59:47.903 --> 59:51.740
Soren, call me back.

59:51.774 --> 59:54.910
Like as soon as possible. OK?

59:55.811 --> 59:59.281
Soren, call me back please!

1:00:00.015 --> 1:00:01.683
I need you to call
me, it's serious.

1:00:12.127 --> 1:00:12.961
Your call cannot...

1:00:15.130 --> 1:00:16.865
Fuck, man.

1:00:16.899 --> 1:00:17.966
Fuck.

1:00:29.978 --> 1:00:31.947
Uh, fuck.

1:00:52.334 --> 1:00:53.836
Who's blowing
up your phone bro?

1:00:53.869 --> 1:00:55.170
It's been happening all day.

1:00:56.105 --> 1:00:58.907
Dude, this chick will
not stop calling me.

1:00:58.941 --> 1:01:00.042
Yeah, right.

1:01:28.737 --> 1:01:30.105
911,
what's your emergency?

1:02:02.304 --> 1:02:03.405
- Say it.
- Fuck me!

1:02:07.843 --> 1:02:09.678
Fuck.

1:02:12.114 --> 1:02:12.915
Say my name.

1:02:13.815 --> 1:02:14.983
You like that?

1:02:17.953 --> 1:02:19.288
Just like that.

1:02:19.321 --> 1:02:20.322
Fucking love that.

1:02:23.058 --> 1:02:24.426
Fuck.

1:02:24.460 --> 1:02:25.294
Fuck.

1:02:26.762 --> 1:02:28.330
Oh god.

1:02:29.131 --> 1:02:29.998
Marley.

1:02:30.265 --> 1:02:31.233
Fuck, Tunde.

1:02:32.468 --> 1:02:34.002
- Fuck.
- Shit.

1:02:41.410 --> 1:02:43.912
- Where the fuck are you going?
- Fuck.

1:02:43.946 --> 1:02:45.314
Look, I'm just...

1:02:45.347 --> 1:02:46.081
I'm sorry.

1:02:46.516 --> 1:02:48.183
- Sorry what?
- I've gotta go talk to Tunde.

1:02:48.217 --> 1:02:49.718
- Tunde!
- Soren!

1:02:49.918 --> 1:02:52.955
Tell me what...

1:02:57.527 --> 1:02:58.327
Tunde.

1:02:59.495 --> 1:03:00.530
Tunde!

1:03:00.563 --> 1:03:01.897
Why? Why would you
bring her here?

1:03:01.930 --> 1:03:02.831
I'm sorry!

1:03:02.864 --> 1:03:04.833
What the fuck
is going on here?

1:03:04.866 --> 1:03:05.635
Oh my gosh!

1:03:05.668 --> 1:03:06.835
You knew
this was going on!

1:03:06.868 --> 1:03:07.704
Tell her.

1:03:07.736 --> 1:03:09.171
What are
you talking about?

1:03:09.204 --> 1:03:09.972
Answer me!

1:03:13.375 --> 1:03:14.977
- God!
- God, Tunde!

1:03:20.849 --> 1:03:21.484
Fuck!

1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:26.421
Babatunde
Adesola Johnson

1:03:26.456 --> 1:03:29.391
was born was born on
December 30th, 2002

1:03:29.424 --> 1:03:30.325
to Adesola Johnson

1:03:30.359 --> 1:03:33.428
and Yomi Okafor for
in Lagos, Nigeria.

1:03:34.263 --> 1:03:36.898
Tunde attended Saint
Ambrose Preparatory Academy

1:03:36.932 --> 1:03:39.469
with his childhood
friend, Marley Meyers.

1:03:39.502 --> 1:03:43.438
Tunde enjoyed the films of
Dee Rees and Ryan Coogler.

1:03:44.906 --> 1:03:46.476
He read the essays of Teju Cole

1:03:46.509 --> 1:03:49.144
and his favorite book
was "Giovanni's Room"

1:03:49.177 --> 1:03:50.145
by James Baldwin.

1:03:58.220 --> 1:03:58.954
Hey.

1:04:06.395 --> 1:04:09.231
So is this serious?

1:04:11.433 --> 1:04:12.434
Yeah, dad.

1:04:12.468 --> 1:04:14.202
It's serious.

1:04:14.236 --> 1:04:15.270
Yeah.

1:04:15.304 --> 1:04:16.506
Well, of course it's serious

1:04:16.539 --> 1:04:18.474
or he wouldn't be here.

1:04:20.476 --> 1:04:24.580
So how long, is
it, you're dating,

1:04:24.614 --> 1:04:25.581
together, a couple?

1:04:25.615 --> 1:04:26.982
How long have you been a couple?

1:04:27.015 --> 1:04:27.983
We're dating, ma.

1:04:28.016 --> 1:04:29.351
- Okay.
- And um?

1:04:29.384 --> 1:04:31.253
Six months?

1:04:31.286 --> 1:04:32.354
Yeah, six months.

1:04:32.387 --> 1:04:34.956
Six months and I'm just
finding out about this now.

1:04:35.991 --> 1:04:37.460
And how did you meet?

1:04:37.859 --> 1:04:39.194
We met at the beach.

1:04:39.227 --> 1:04:40.530
Soren surfs.

1:04:40.563 --> 1:04:41.597
Yeah.

1:04:42.565 --> 1:04:43.932
He likes to surf.

1:04:43.965 --> 1:04:45.635
And are you in school together?

1:04:45.668 --> 1:04:47.035
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he's...

1:04:47.069 --> 1:04:48.337
We got a
couple of classes.

1:04:48.370 --> 1:04:49.304
Yeah, he's
in my film class.

1:04:49.338 --> 1:04:50.872
Ah, the film class.

1:04:50.906 --> 1:04:51.507
Okay.

1:04:51.541 --> 1:04:52.575
Yes.

1:04:53.643 --> 1:04:55.478
Yeah, and I knew
him through Marley as well.

1:04:55.511 --> 1:04:57.045
Oh, you know, Marley?

1:04:57.079 --> 1:04:58.146
Oh, we love Marley.

1:04:58.180 --> 1:04:59.081
Oh yes.

1:04:59.114 --> 1:05:00.616
She's a lovely girl.

1:05:00.650 --> 1:05:01.617
Yeah, she is.

1:05:01.651 --> 1:05:03.418
And you are all
in class together then.

1:05:04.119 --> 1:05:05.488
Well, we should
have them over to

1:05:05.521 --> 1:05:06.321
watch a movie sometime.

1:05:06.355 --> 1:05:07.490
Absolutely.

1:05:07.523 --> 1:05:08.390
Yes, please.

1:05:08.423 --> 1:05:09.358
You're welcome here anytime.

1:05:11.561 --> 1:05:13.128
So, Soren,

1:05:14.396 --> 1:05:15.297
um, what else do you...

1:05:15.330 --> 1:05:16.466
And how are your grades?

1:07:42.812 --> 1:07:43.779
Wait, doesn't that hurt?

1:07:46.682 --> 1:07:47.583
What?

1:07:51.152 --> 1:07:52.287
You rubbing it?

1:07:54.189 --> 1:07:55.023
No.

1:07:57.225 --> 1:07:58.059
Why would it?

1:08:04.232 --> 1:08:05.635
Thanks for skipping practice.

1:08:08.136 --> 1:08:09.104
Anything for you.

1:08:31.259 --> 1:08:33.829
He is like, so hot.

1:08:38.534 --> 1:08:40.335
Soren and I have been fucking.

1:08:43.204 --> 1:08:44.740
Right.

1:08:44.774 --> 1:08:46.809
No, he's gay, Marley.

1:08:49.879 --> 1:08:54.249
He's gay and we're in love.

1:09:00.221 --> 1:09:00.856
I'm serious.

1:09:01.222 --> 1:09:04.159
Look, I admire your
commitment to the part.

1:09:04.192 --> 1:09:05.728
It's not a part, Marley.

1:09:06.629 --> 1:09:07.429
He's gay.

1:09:09.799 --> 1:09:11.467
I'm asking you as a friend

1:09:11.500 --> 1:09:14.837
to please back off.

1:09:19.508 --> 1:09:21.844
- As a friend?
- Yeah.

1:09:29.585 --> 1:09:30.452
Okay.

1:09:32.622 --> 1:09:33.856
Thanks.

1:09:33.889 --> 1:09:35.290
Thank you.

1:09:35.958 --> 1:09:36.826
Thanks?

1:09:38.527 --> 1:09:39.895
Yeah, thanks.

1:09:42.898 --> 1:09:45.668
Let me give you some advice,

1:09:46.769 --> 1:09:47.803
as a friend,

1:09:49.972 --> 1:09:51.874
people like Soren,

1:09:51.907 --> 1:09:53.876
don't end up with
people like you.

1:09:55.778 --> 1:09:58.614
They'll fuck around
once or twice, sure.

1:09:58.648 --> 1:09:59.815
They'll experiment,

1:10:00.950 --> 1:10:02.317
but in the end,

1:10:02.350 --> 1:10:04.252
they end up with girls like me

1:10:04.285 --> 1:10:05.921
and have two and a
half kids with a yard

1:10:05.955 --> 1:10:07.757
and a white fucking
picket fence.

1:10:09.424 --> 1:10:11.694
So enjoy it while lasts, Tunde.

1:10:14.597 --> 1:10:17.800
Three, two, one.

1:10:35.350 --> 1:10:36.552
Driving
against the back to O'Connor,

1:10:36.585 --> 1:10:37.452
he takes the one V one,

1:10:37.486 --> 1:10:38.554
spins off the man.

1:10:39.354 --> 1:10:40.456
Shoots.

1:10:40.489 --> 1:10:40.956
Scores!

1:10:43.993 --> 1:10:45.494
Exeter East River has no answer

1:10:45.528 --> 1:10:47.328
to number two, Soren O'Connor.

1:10:51.266 --> 1:10:52.333
There you have it.

1:10:52.367 --> 1:10:53.536
Soren O'Connor's hat trick

1:10:53.569 --> 1:10:55.403
puts Saint Ambrose
through for the win.

1:10:55.437 --> 1:10:57.506
Final score, Saint Ambrose five,

1:10:57.540 --> 1:10:58.874
and Exeter East River, four.

1:10:58.908 --> 1:11:00.308
Yeah.

1:11:43.152 --> 1:11:44.053
You played your ass off.

1:11:44.086 --> 1:11:45.453
Thank you, thank you.

1:11:45.488 --> 1:11:47.590
You guys are so wasted.

1:11:51.026 --> 1:11:52.327
Do you shop?

1:11:55.731 --> 1:11:57.700
Cut that shit, man.

1:11:57.733 --> 1:12:00.002
Okay, someone's on their period.

1:12:01.070 --> 1:12:01.904
What the fuck you just say?

1:12:03.606 --> 1:12:04.206
Okay.

1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:05.674
You're not on your period.

1:12:07.943 --> 1:12:09.344
All right, okay.

1:12:09.377 --> 1:12:11.080
Well, you know,
he's trying to hang.

1:12:11.113 --> 1:12:12.481
He's gotta get

1:12:12.515 --> 1:12:14.683
through initiation.

1:12:15.584 --> 1:12:18.087
Merry fucking Christmas.

1:12:21.924 --> 1:12:23.459
Celebrating tonight, remember?

1:12:23.492 --> 1:12:24.527
Hell yeah, we are.

1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:25.895
Fuck
Exeter East River.

1:12:25.928 --> 1:12:27.029
Fuck Exeter East River.

1:12:27.062 --> 1:12:28.631
Fuck
Exeter East River.

1:12:28.664 --> 1:12:29.965
Fuck Exeter East River.

1:12:29.999 --> 1:12:31.801
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.

1:12:31.834 --> 1:12:35.638
Oof. Itching
for some cocaina, bro

1:12:36.472 --> 1:12:38.040
Daddy needs a buzz.

1:12:38.507 --> 1:12:40.042
Tunde, you got blow?

1:12:40.075 --> 1:12:41.944
- No.
- No, Marley's got some.

1:12:44.013 --> 1:12:46.015
What? You're like a
fucking pharmacy.

1:12:48.617 --> 1:12:49.752
Bathroom.

1:12:50.186 --> 1:12:52.054
Always, bathroom.

1:13:23.552 --> 1:13:25.420
I'm going to
eviscerate you, bitch.

1:13:25.453 --> 1:13:26.021
Fuck you.

1:13:26.055 --> 1:13:27.890
Fuck you.

1:13:28.924 --> 1:13:30.092
Where'd you go?

1:13:30.125 --> 1:13:31.093
Come out.

1:13:33.062 --> 1:13:34.096
Fuck you.

1:13:36.131 --> 1:13:38.067
I know, fuck, I
know where you are.

1:13:40.135 --> 1:13:41.904
Get ready to die.

1:13:42.938 --> 1:13:44.173
Come on.

1:13:46.942 --> 1:13:47.810
Christ.

1:13:48.744 --> 1:13:49.578
Sorry.

1:13:52.948 --> 1:13:53.782
You all done?

1:13:55.184 --> 1:13:56.685
I think so.

1:14:00.456 --> 1:14:01.790
I'm not usually like this,

1:14:01.824 --> 1:14:03.058
it's just...

1:14:03.092 --> 1:14:05.027
Oh, I'm sure you can
handle your liquor.

1:14:08.230 --> 1:14:09.430
There you go.

1:14:09.465 --> 1:14:10.132
Thanks.

1:14:12.902 --> 1:14:14.036
You with the team?

1:14:15.137 --> 1:14:17.172
No, I'm a friend.

1:14:19.642 --> 1:14:20.876
Oh.

1:14:21.911 --> 1:14:23.178
Oh shit, I missed
the game again.

1:14:23.212 --> 1:14:25.214
How'd they play?

1:14:25.247 --> 1:14:26.815
They were great.

1:14:26.849 --> 1:14:27.650
Yeah?

1:14:27.683 --> 1:14:28.584
Yeah.

1:14:29.852 --> 1:14:30.386
Good.

1:14:30.418 --> 1:14:32.054
How about Soren, is he,

1:14:32.087 --> 1:14:33.122
is he having fun out there?

1:14:33.155 --> 1:14:35.057
Oh yeah. He's good.

1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:39.795
You threw him a hell of a party.

1:14:39.828 --> 1:14:40.996
Oh, thanks man.

1:14:41.030 --> 1:14:41.830
Excuse me.

1:14:43.499 --> 1:14:44.833
Yeah, he'll,

1:14:44.867 --> 1:14:48.103
he'll see it as a
penance of sorts.

1:14:48.137 --> 1:14:51.106
Me pouring money into
a void I created,

1:14:51.974 --> 1:14:53.175
according to him.

1:15:00.282 --> 1:15:04.053
You know, we used
to talk all the time

1:15:04.086 --> 1:15:05.087
when he was young,

1:15:06.689 --> 1:15:08.524
talked about everything.

1:15:08.557 --> 1:15:10.159
Me and my boy against the world.

1:15:13.062 --> 1:15:14.463
He talks about you a lot.

1:15:15.965 --> 1:15:16.799
He does?

1:15:18.033 --> 1:15:18.901
Yeah.

1:15:22.638 --> 1:15:24.873
I mean, I just got so busy

1:15:24.907 --> 1:15:28.210
with work and failed marriage.

1:15:30.179 --> 1:15:32.114
Christ, I don't even
recognize him anymore.

1:15:35.317 --> 1:15:37.953
He's good people, Mr. O'Connor.

1:15:40.089 --> 1:15:40.923
Thank you.

1:15:42.257 --> 1:15:43.926
Call me Alfred.

1:15:43.959 --> 1:15:45.728
Yeah, I'm Tunde. Uh...

1:15:47.629 --> 1:15:48.564
Tunde.

1:15:48.931 --> 1:15:49.865
Tunde?

1:15:50.366 --> 1:15:51.567
That's an interesting name.

1:15:53.335 --> 1:15:54.703
Well, you know Tunde,

1:15:54.737 --> 1:15:57.206
now that I've poured
my heart out to ya,

1:15:57.239 --> 1:15:59.308
I'm dying for a cigarette.

1:15:59.341 --> 1:16:00.275
You smoke?

1:16:02.144 --> 1:16:02.945
Um.

1:16:05.814 --> 1:16:06.882
Yeah?

1:16:06.915 --> 1:16:08.851
Yeah. Yeah.

1:16:09.985 --> 1:16:11.587
Let's have one.

1:16:11.620 --> 1:16:12.254
Okay.

1:16:13.589 --> 1:16:14.223
You got any?

1:16:15.657 --> 1:16:16.592
No.

1:16:19.762 --> 1:16:21.063
You know what, why don't we go
get a pack.

1:16:22.998 --> 1:16:24.299
Okay, sounds good.

1:16:24.333 --> 1:16:25.701
Cause I'm not going out there.

1:16:25.734 --> 1:16:27.636
I fucking hate parties.

1:16:27.669 --> 1:16:28.270
Come on.

1:16:34.043 --> 1:16:34.977
I needed this.

1:16:38.247 --> 1:16:39.048
Yeah.

1:16:40.015 --> 1:16:40.883
Wow.

1:16:45.387 --> 1:16:48.824
Hey, I've always wanted to ask,

1:16:49.792 --> 1:16:52.561
do you believe the stuff
that you say on TV?

1:16:54.329 --> 1:16:57.900
Yeah, sure,

1:16:57.933 --> 1:16:58.834
for the most part.

1:17:02.404 --> 1:17:03.906
I love this country, man.

1:17:06.308 --> 1:17:07.976
I believe in the dream,

1:17:08.010 --> 1:17:09.278
the mythos,

1:17:09.311 --> 1:17:11.080
America the great,
America the bold,

1:17:11.113 --> 1:17:13.582
the shining city on the hill.

1:17:14.950 --> 1:17:17.252
We're a pretty shitty city.

1:17:18.654 --> 1:17:20.122
Yeah, well, you know.

1:17:21.290 --> 1:17:23.859
Some people feel that way.

1:17:23.892 --> 1:17:25.094
We do our best.

1:17:28.430 --> 1:17:29.264
We try.

1:17:33.368 --> 1:17:34.703
You should try listening.

1:17:37.172 --> 1:17:38.340
Well, you know,

1:17:38.373 --> 1:17:41.944
my show provides a platform
for everyone to talk, yeah.

1:17:41.977 --> 1:17:42.811
Nah.

1:17:44.012 --> 1:17:47.983
I mean like listen,
actually listen.

1:17:49.952 --> 1:17:53.222
An entire group of people
can't make up an experience.

1:17:57.359 --> 1:18:02.698
You know, there is this
idea floating around

1:18:02.731 --> 1:18:05.367
that because you're white,

1:18:08.471 --> 1:18:10.372
you can't suffer,

1:18:11.106 --> 1:18:13.342
that you can't possibly
understand pain

1:18:13.375 --> 1:18:14.910
unless you're black or gay,

1:18:14.943 --> 1:18:16.078
or an immigrant.

1:18:16.111 --> 1:18:17.346
Who said that?

1:18:17.379 --> 1:18:21.416
Suffering, like
death is guaranteed.

1:18:23.452 --> 1:18:26.388
In fact, the only thing
equal about us, really,

1:18:26.421 --> 1:18:27.890
is we all hurt the same.

1:18:29.158 --> 1:18:33.929
The only difference
is because I'm white,

1:18:33.962 --> 1:18:38.400
when I cry out, I get
called a racist or a bigot.

1:18:42.905 --> 1:18:45.774
When in reality, I
just want to be heard.

1:18:50.412 --> 1:18:51.446
You have a TV show.

1:19:01.491 --> 1:19:02.691
This may be a stupid question,

1:19:02.724 --> 1:19:07.763
but do you find that this whole
thing works with the ladies?

1:19:08.063 --> 1:19:09.765
You know, the whole woke thing?

1:19:15.103 --> 1:19:16.472
I'm gay, Alfred.

1:19:20.577 --> 1:19:22.945
No, I'm... I'm gay.

1:19:24.780 --> 1:19:26.048
I'm in love with your son,

1:19:29.785 --> 1:19:30.786
and he loves me too.

1:19:35.390 --> 1:19:38.860
I know that's a lot to like
drop on you tonight and,

1:19:42.331 --> 1:19:45.867
it's hard to hear,
but it's real.

1:19:48.504 --> 1:19:50.372
We really do love each other.

1:19:57.346 --> 1:19:59.881
I gotta get, I
gotta get a drink. So...

1:20:02.851 --> 1:20:03.986
You want anything?

1:20:05.488 --> 1:20:07.789
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

1:20:21.504 --> 1:20:23.305
You finding everything okay?

1:20:24.306 --> 1:20:25.575
Yeah.

1:20:25.608 --> 1:20:27.109
Are these any good?

1:20:27.142 --> 1:20:29.878
They're really good
for a party of one.

1:20:43.593 --> 1:20:45.093
- That's all for you?
- Yeah.

1:20:45.894 --> 1:20:46.428
All right.

1:20:56.938 --> 1:20:58.474
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Back up!

1:20:58.508 --> 1:20:59.908
I said back up!

1:21:00.576 --> 1:21:02.311
- Tunde, you all right?
- Oh my god.

1:21:02.344 --> 1:21:03.979
- What are you doing?
- Take it easy.

1:21:04.012 --> 1:21:04.980
Leave him alone!

1:21:05.013 --> 1:21:05.615
Get back inside.

1:21:07.349 --> 1:21:08.884
Back up!

1:21:08.917 --> 1:21:09.951
I said back up!

1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:19.562
You know who I am? Huh?

1:21:19.595 --> 1:21:21.096
You recognize this face?

1:21:21.129 --> 1:21:22.097
You're about to be
under arrest sir

1:21:22.130 --> 1:21:23.899
if you keep carrying on.

1:21:23.932 --> 1:21:25.067
You haven't heard
the last of this.

1:21:29.171 --> 1:21:30.339
Get back guys.

1:21:32.274 --> 1:21:33.543
Get back man. Get back.

1:21:34.544 --> 1:21:35.611
Get outta here.

1:21:36.912 --> 1:21:37.814
Back up!

1:21:37.846 --> 1:21:38.880
Soren.

1:21:39.981 --> 1:21:40.550
- Are you all right?
- Get outta here.

1:21:40.583 --> 1:21:41.651
Tonight.

1:21:41.684 --> 1:21:43.085
Get back, come on.

1:21:43.118 --> 1:21:44.587
Leave him alone.

1:21:44.620 --> 1:21:45.655
Tunde.

1:21:46.988 --> 1:21:47.790
Let him go.

1:21:47.824 --> 1:21:49.891
Get back.

1:21:53.195 --> 1:21:53.962
Back up!

1:21:59.401 --> 1:22:00.202
Leave him alone!

1:22:00.235 --> 1:22:02.672
I can't,

1:22:16.184 --> 1:22:17.986
I can't,

1:22:25.327 --> 1:22:26.261
I can't,

1:22:54.923 --> 1:22:56.459
I can't breathe.

1:23:11.574 --> 1:23:13.442
Tunde leaves
to cherish his memories,

1:23:13.476 --> 1:23:15.210
his beloved mother Yomi,

1:23:15.243 --> 1:23:16.612
and his father, Adesola,

1:23:18.714 --> 1:23:21.484
his maternal
grandparents, Taio Okeke,

1:23:21.517 --> 1:23:23.653
and Adora Okeke,

1:23:25.020 --> 1:23:27.523
his cousin, Ibrahim Adebayo,

1:23:27.557 --> 1:23:32.027
his aunt, Tiwa Adebayo,

1:23:32.060 --> 1:23:32.994
his uncle, Yeli Olewimi,

1:23:34.396 --> 1:23:37.567
and Yeli's daughters,
Oluchi, Ester, and Kainde.

1:23:40.168 --> 1:23:41.737
I will no longer die.

1:23:43.639 --> 1:23:45.675
I have become 200
hills rolled into one.

1:23:47.610 --> 1:23:49.144
I am immovable.

1:24:01.691 --> 1:24:02.692
Marley.

1:24:04.392 --> 1:24:06.462
Hi, baby.

1:24:06.729 --> 1:24:07.563
Hi.

1:24:09.832 --> 1:24:12.602
You know we're
close, right, Marls?

1:24:12.635 --> 1:24:13.636
Yeah, we are like,

1:24:13.669 --> 1:24:16.037
like two peas in a pod.

1:24:16.071 --> 1:24:17.172
Yeah.

1:24:17.205 --> 1:24:18.240
Like,

1:24:18.273 --> 1:24:19.475
um,

1:24:19.509 --> 1:24:20.710
Thelma and Louise.

1:24:21.677 --> 1:24:26.348
Um, Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid.

1:24:26.381 --> 1:24:27.349
Marley.

1:24:27.717 --> 1:24:29.785
- Hans Solo and Chewbacca.
- Marley.

1:24:29.819 --> 1:24:32.488
We are the bestest of friends.

1:24:32.522 --> 1:24:33.456
Marley, listen.

1:24:34.490 --> 1:24:36.024
Yeah?

1:24:41.697 --> 1:24:42.465
What?

1:24:47.537 --> 1:24:50.673
You know that I would never do

1:24:51.741 --> 1:24:53.509
or say

1:24:53.543 --> 1:24:54.744
anything to hurt you,

1:24:57.445 --> 1:24:58.280
not on purpose.

1:25:01.751 --> 1:25:05.220
Tunde, you're scaring me.

1:25:05.621 --> 1:25:06.454
What?

1:25:07.890 --> 1:25:09.725
I can tell you anything, right?

1:25:11.293 --> 1:25:13.094
Like anything because we,

1:25:13.896 --> 1:25:15.230
like we're friends.

1:25:16.699 --> 1:25:19.100
And that's what matters
most above anything else.

1:25:22.337 --> 1:25:23.171
What?

1:25:24.607 --> 1:25:25.474
What is it?

1:25:33.749 --> 1:25:34.584
Soren.

1:25:36.719 --> 1:25:37.553
Soren, um,

1:25:39.555 --> 1:25:42.190
Soren and I, we've
been seeing each other.

1:25:43.593 --> 1:25:44.426
What?

1:25:46.361 --> 1:25:48.396
It's been going on for a while.

1:25:52.602 --> 1:25:53.836
I know that like,
I should've like,

1:25:53.869 --> 1:25:56.706
- we should've told you...
- Wait!

1:25:56.739 --> 1:25:57.573
Stop.

1:25:58.941 --> 1:26:00.876
I'm confused.

1:26:00.910 --> 1:26:02.410
I'm sorry.

1:26:02.444 --> 1:26:04.580
- No, he likes me.
- I'm sorry.

1:26:04.814 --> 1:26:05.681
I'm so sorry.

1:26:06.882 --> 1:26:09.117
- This is not...
- Don't fucking touch me.

1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:12.888
I loved him,

1:26:12.922 --> 1:26:14.457
and you knew that.

1:26:15.390 --> 1:26:17.793
You're bad inside, Tunde.

1:26:17.827 --> 1:26:19.595
You're fucking sick.

1:26:20.295 --> 1:26:20.896
Fuck you.

1:26:39.447 --> 1:26:40.916
Oh, hey babe.

1:26:40.950 --> 1:26:41.784
Come here.

1:26:43.218 --> 1:26:45.220
Do you have anything
you'd like to say to me?

1:26:52.394 --> 1:26:53.629
I asked you a question.

1:27:00.803 --> 1:27:01.704
Huh?

1:27:05.775 --> 1:27:06.942
Can we talk about
this over here?

1:27:11.379 --> 1:27:13.749
Marley, I'm sorry.

1:27:13.783 --> 1:27:14.517
Okay?

1:27:14.984 --> 1:27:16.485
That's it?

1:27:16.519 --> 1:27:18.353
That's all you
have to say to me?

1:27:20.623 --> 1:27:21.423
No,

1:27:22.825 --> 1:27:24.860
no, I want to say
that I'm sorry.

1:27:24.894 --> 1:27:26.462
And then I care about you,

1:27:28.631 --> 1:27:29.598
and that sometimes,

1:27:32.001 --> 1:27:33.969
I have trouble
speaking about things

1:27:34.003 --> 1:27:35.638
because it's hard and words hurt

1:27:35.671 --> 1:27:37.338
and I don't wanna hurt anyone.

1:27:38.373 --> 1:27:39.975
Just because you're fucked up

1:27:40.009 --> 1:27:42.277
doesn't mean you get to
fuck other people up.

1:27:43.311 --> 1:27:45.447
You could've respected
me enough to be honest.

1:27:45.481 --> 1:27:46.281
I know.

1:27:46.314 --> 1:27:47.516
You're a fucking liar.

1:27:47.550 --> 1:27:48.718
I know, I'm sorry.

1:27:48.751 --> 1:27:49.685
Are you gay?

1:27:49.719 --> 1:27:51.754
What?

1:27:51.787 --> 1:27:53.254
I asked you a fucking question.

1:27:53.288 --> 1:27:53.923
Answer it.

1:27:55.958 --> 1:27:56.959
Are you gay?

1:27:57.827 --> 1:27:58.994
What the fuck kinda
question is that?

1:27:59.028 --> 1:27:59.795
Answer my fucking question.

1:27:59.829 --> 1:28:00.830
I'm not answering shit.

1:28:01.864 --> 1:28:02.898
Why, because you're gay?

1:28:10.973 --> 1:28:11.807
Oh my God.

1:28:15.343 --> 1:28:17.847
You're fucking my best friend.

1:28:27.990 --> 1:28:28.991
I'm sorry.

1:28:40.002 --> 1:28:40.770
I just wanted you to know that.

1:28:40.803 --> 1:28:41.904
Yeah, my friend's
waiting for you.

1:28:41.937 --> 1:28:42.972
Okay.

1:28:45.107 --> 1:28:47.610
Get the fuck out of here.

1:29:03.526 --> 1:29:04.727
The fuck did you just do?

1:29:05.761 --> 1:29:06.595
I told her the truth.

1:29:08.564 --> 1:29:09.632
She deserved to know.

1:29:09.665 --> 1:29:10.499
The truth?

1:29:13.035 --> 1:29:14.737
Oh what,

1:29:15.436 --> 1:29:16.972
checking to see who's watching?

1:29:22.745 --> 1:29:24.580
You touch on her and you
do everything with her.

1:29:26.081 --> 1:29:29.051
Like, you're right
in front of me, so,

1:29:29.084 --> 1:29:29.919
what was I supposed to do?

1:29:31.419 --> 1:29:32.988
You could have
fucking waited on me

1:29:33.022 --> 1:29:33.789
to figure out...

1:29:33.823 --> 1:29:34.924
I could've fucking
waited on you?

1:29:34.957 --> 1:29:35.958
Yeah.

1:29:35.991 --> 1:29:37.059
I could've fucking
waited on you?

1:29:37.092 --> 1:29:38.661
Yeah, you could've.

1:29:38.694 --> 1:29:40.996
What do you think I've been
doing all this time, huh?

1:29:41.030 --> 1:29:43.566
All I do is fucking wait on you.

1:29:46.001 --> 1:29:46.936
I'm tired of waiting.

1:29:46.969 --> 1:29:50.105
I'm tired of having to
live in the shadows,

1:29:50.139 --> 1:29:51.607
of having to duck and hide

1:29:51.640 --> 1:29:53.809
every time your
friends come around,

1:29:53.843 --> 1:29:56.145
your dumb fucking
friends come around.

1:29:56.178 --> 1:29:57.345
I'm sorry.

1:29:59.014 --> 1:29:59.882
Or your dad.

1:30:07.156 --> 1:30:08.389
Tunde.

1:30:09.091 --> 1:30:11.093
You think I wanted to do that?

1:30:11.126 --> 1:30:11.961
Huh?

1:30:13.896 --> 1:30:15.531
I didn't wanna fucking do that.

1:30:16.932 --> 1:30:18.467
I'm giving you everything.

1:30:18.500 --> 1:30:20.502
I gave you my best
fucking friend.

1:30:26.809 --> 1:30:28.544
I want you, Soren,

1:30:28.577 --> 1:30:30.579
like I want you.

1:30:30.613 --> 1:30:31.614
I fucking hate it.

1:30:36.986 --> 1:30:37.786
I just,

1:30:39.889 --> 1:30:42.825
I need to know like some kind
of way that you want me, too.

1:30:47.162 --> 1:30:48.163
Hmm?

1:30:48.197 --> 1:30:49.031
I do.

1:30:54.637 --> 1:30:55.436
I do.

1:31:01.010 --> 1:31:02.443
Of course I do.

1:31:05.714 --> 1:31:06.515
I just,

1:31:09.151 --> 1:31:11.654
- I gotta have some time.
- No.

1:31:11.854 --> 1:31:13.622
- I just...
- No!

1:31:20.195 --> 1:31:20.963
No.

1:31:22.197 --> 1:31:23.599
If you want me, then

1:31:25.501 --> 1:31:27.603
let's go in there and
tell your dad right now,

1:31:29.171 --> 1:31:29.972
tonight.

1:31:40.115 --> 1:31:41.150
Okay.

1:31:46.255 --> 1:31:47.523
Okay.

1:31:47.556 --> 1:31:48.190
Okay?

1:31:48.390 --> 1:31:49.091
Yeah.

1:31:51.694 --> 1:31:53.128
Okay.

1:31:55.164 --> 1:31:55.965
Okay?

1:31:56.632 --> 1:31:58.167
- Okay.
- Okay, yeah, okay.

1:32:00.135 --> 1:32:00.970
Okay.

1:32:31.633 --> 1:32:32.301
Hi, I'm
Alfred O'Connor.

1:32:32.334 --> 1:32:33.936
Thanks for watching tonight.

1:32:35.404 --> 1:32:37.539
We have Keisha Rivera,

1:32:37.573 --> 1:32:39.641
a political organizer
based in Chicago,

1:32:39.675 --> 1:32:40.676
Hey Dad?

1:32:41.343 --> 1:32:42.177
Oh hey.

1:32:43.178 --> 1:32:44.179
You got a sec?

1:32:44.213 --> 1:32:45.314
Yeah.

1:32:45.347 --> 1:32:46.281
Who are you?

1:32:46.515 --> 1:32:47.516
I'm Tunde.

1:32:48.751 --> 1:32:50.552
Tunde?

1:32:50.586 --> 1:32:51.186
What is that, African?

1:32:51.887 --> 1:32:52.721
Yes sir.

1:32:52.755 --> 1:32:53.956
Interesting.

1:32:53.989 --> 1:32:54.723
Hey, come on in.

1:32:54.757 --> 1:32:55.224
Have a seat, guys.

1:32:57.960 --> 1:33:01.130
Just watching the 11
o'clock rerun of the show.

1:33:01.163 --> 1:33:03.165
I like to do that.

1:33:04.700 --> 1:33:08.103
So, gentlemen, what
can I do for you?

1:33:14.376 --> 1:33:15.544
Well,

1:33:16.278 --> 1:33:17.312
dad, this is a,

1:33:20.349 --> 1:33:21.550
this is

1:33:22.818 --> 1:33:24.053
sort of difficult for me.

1:33:24.887 --> 1:33:25.754
And.

1:33:29.658 --> 1:33:30.893
Don't stutter.

1:33:30.926 --> 1:33:32.227
Say what you mean, Soren.

1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:40.869
I know that you
have certain views

1:33:40.903 --> 1:33:42.171
about this kind of thing,

1:33:44.239 --> 1:33:45.274
and um,

1:34:05.828 --> 1:34:07.262
I'm,

1:34:07.296 --> 1:34:09.665
I'm upset that you didn't come
to my lacrosse game today.

1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:13.268
I just wished that you
would have been there.

1:34:16.939 --> 1:34:18.740
And I just wanted
you to know that.

1:34:20.275 --> 1:34:23.112
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

1:34:24.313 --> 1:34:26.215
I wish you just said
something sooner.

1:34:27.783 --> 1:34:29.418
There, I said it.

1:34:32.254 --> 1:34:33.655
I didn't
realize how important

1:34:33.689 --> 1:34:34.923
it was to you.

1:34:34.957 --> 1:34:35.791
And I'm sorry.

1:34:36.825 --> 1:34:40.129
I'll be at the next one, okay?

1:34:40.162 --> 1:34:41.930
Sorry, I'm just really busy.

1:34:43.332 --> 1:34:45.134
I'm doing my best.

1:34:45.901 --> 1:34:46.802
I love you, man.

1:34:49.771 --> 1:34:51.406
I'm never gonna
miss another game.

1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:53.442
I promise, okay.

1:35:05.854 --> 1:35:08.023
Point of
contact this evening,

1:35:08.056 --> 1:35:10.392
in light of the tragic
shooting of high school senior,

1:35:10.425 --> 1:35:13.463
Sydnee Harris, is
police brutality.

1:35:13.496 --> 1:35:15.797
Sydnee was only 18 years old.

1:35:20.035 --> 1:35:21.870
I'm not going to miss
another game, I promise.

1:35:21.904 --> 1:35:22.771
That's my cue.

1:35:24.406 --> 1:35:25.374
What do you mean?

1:35:27.075 --> 1:35:27.876
I was just,

1:35:29.378 --> 1:35:31.280
I was just here
for moral support.

1:35:34.016 --> 1:35:34.816
Right, Soren?

1:35:40.322 --> 1:35:41.056
Yeah.

1:35:52.535 --> 1:35:53.368
Tunde.

1:35:54.403 --> 1:35:55.204
What?

1:35:59.308 --> 1:35:59.975
You did it.

1:36:00.008 --> 1:36:02.244
You said what you needed to say.

1:36:11.286 --> 1:36:13.789
It was so nice to meet
you, Mr. O'Connor.

1:36:17.460 --> 1:36:18.461
Yeah.

1:36:18.494 --> 1:36:19.795
Yeah, it was good
to meet you too.

1:36:19.828 --> 1:36:21.430
Thank you for
supporting my, my son.

1:36:26.435 --> 1:36:28.804
Hey, hey, come on.

1:36:31.574 --> 1:36:33.476
I'm sorry.

1:36:33.509 --> 1:36:34.443
Sorry buddy.

1:36:34.477 --> 1:36:36.479
I didn't realize how
important it was to you.

1:36:37.547 --> 1:36:38.380
I screwed up.

1:36:39.114 --> 1:36:40.315
I just, I wanted
you to be there.

1:36:40.349 --> 1:36:41.517
I won't make the mistake again.

1:36:41.551 --> 1:36:43.151
I'm sorry, buddy.

1:36:43.185 --> 1:36:43.986
Okay?

1:36:45.454 --> 1:36:47.523
I'll be at all the
games, from now on, okay.

1:36:49.091 --> 1:36:50.325
Sorry.

1:36:50.359 --> 1:36:51.159
I love you man.
