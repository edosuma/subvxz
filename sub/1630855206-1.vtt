(crow cawing)

01:22.125 --> 01:23.208
AMY: How does she know?

01:23.291 --> 01:26.125
She says you have
to imagine you're the tree.

01:26.208 --> 01:27.416
People get tattoos.

01:28.791 --> 01:30.166
My teacher has a tattoo.

What school do you go to?

01:38.416 --> 01:39.708
My school's at home.

01:43.833 --> 01:45.166
Do you want to do your name?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.250
I should go. Mom worries if I'm late.

01:53.333 --> 01:54.416
I can do it for you.

01:56.375 --> 01:58.583
That way, when you walk
to school tomorrow, you can see it.

02:00.208 --> 02:03.041
Okay. My name is Sara.

02:03.125 --> 02:05.416
-S-A-R-A, right?

How old are you?

02:08.875 --> 02:10.125

Twelve?

02:15.708 --> 02:17.000

02:35.375 --> 02:37.666
SARA (yelling): No! Stop!

02:38.291 --> 02:41.833

02:44.583 --> 02:46.500
-(Sara's muffled yelling)
-TAMSIN: Amy, hold her legs!

02:47.666 --> 02:49.375

04:43.208 --> 04:46.375
One, two, three...

04:47.833 --> 04:48.916
You did it, Mom!

04:49.041 --> 04:50.041
(gasping)

04:50.125 --> 04:52.083
Two minutes and three seconds!

04:52.166 --> 04:54.750
Yeah!

Whoo.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.041
(groans)
I can't feel my toes.

05:16.125 --> 05:17.583
You might have to go in and get 'em.

05:17.666 --> 05:18.875
(chuckles)

05:18.958 --> 05:20.291
Here's your tea, Mom.

05:20.375 --> 05:22.208
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

05:24.708 --> 05:25.625
Hey.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.375
I'll race you back.

(Freya laughs)

05:30.583 --> 05:31.625
Oh, hey!

05:32.541 --> 05:33.916
Hey, no fair!

05:34.958 --> 05:37.291
You've got a head start.

Surprise, surprise.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.625
Come on.

06:16.833 --> 06:19.000
You're like a little whippet, boy.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.458
So fast.

08:49.166 --> 08:52.083
taken from the small country town
of Woodfield.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.750
The young lass was last seen

09:04.458 --> 09:05.541
-Okay.
-(Freya sighs)

09:06.291 --> 09:07.333
All right, thanks.

HARRY'S MOTHER: I caved
on some takeaway tonight, too.

09:10.458 --> 09:13.166
I came out of yoga to a flat tire.
Would you believe it?

09:13.250 --> 09:14.166
(chuckles)

09:14.250 --> 09:17.291
Rani says it's my negative energy.
Something else to work on, apparently.

09:17.375 --> 09:18.833
(both chuckle softly)

09:18.916 --> 09:20.583
Oh, Freya. Why don't you join us?

09:49.375 --> 09:51.250
The dining hall is through here.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.958
Our dormitory's downstairs.

09:55.041 --> 09:57.541
And through here...

10:00.416 --> 10:02.750
(lock rattles)

10:03.625 --> 10:04.791
...is Mommy's room.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.916
(ominous music playing)

10:19.125 --> 10:21.000

10:21.083 --> 10:23.333
TAMSIN:
Mommy will be home soon to meet you.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.833

(chanting in distance)

10:41.458 --> 10:44.500
(clatters in distance)

10:46.250 --> 10:47.958
I want my mom.

10:49.291 --> 10:50.541
I want my mom.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.208
What are you doing?

10:59.333 --> 11:01.000
-TAMSIN: Hold still now.

-Do you?

11:04.708 --> 11:06.791
(chanting continues)

11:11.500 --> 11:13.166
SARA: It's burning!

11:13.750 --> 11:15.458

while calling on all members
of the public to please come forward,

11:38.333 --> 11:41.291
if you have any information whatsoever.

11:41.375 --> 11:44.416
Now, we know the girl
was last seen walking home from school

11:44.500 --> 11:46.125
at around 4:00 p.m.

11:46.208 --> 11:49.166
This is a small, close-knit community
that is hurting right now.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.166
(dial tone)

11:50.250 --> 11:53.083

Hi, Joe, it's me. Have you seen the news?

11:56.250 --> 11:57.583
SARA'S MOTHER:
We just want our daughter back.

11:59.291 --> 12:01.708
We need her home safe, in our arms.

12:02.791 --> 12:04.500
I know she's still out there.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.958
Mommy loves you, sweetheart.

12:08.041 --> 12:10.041
(Sara's mother sobs)

12:11.000 --> 12:13.416

12:28.500 --> 12:30.500
-Be quiet.
-I want to go home.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.833
They'll hear you.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.916
(panting)

12:39.000 --> 12:41.208
(Sara sobbing in distance)

14:35.375 --> 14:38.333
AMY: Wake up. Wake up, wake up.

14:38.416 --> 14:40.375
Hey, wake up, wake up, wake up.
Go to my bed.

14:40.458 --> 14:41.958
-Go to my bed, go, go, go.
-(groans)

14:42.041 --> 14:43.000
Quick, quick.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.166
Quickly, before she comes, go.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.375
(bell ringing)

15:08.041 --> 15:09.041
(Tamsin sighs)

15:09.125 --> 15:10.916
Good morning, children.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.708
Abigail, rise and shine.

15:13.916 --> 15:15.958
(key clanking)

15:50.791 --> 15:54.208
Everybody into your tracksuits.
Aunty Hannah's waiting.

15:54.291 --> 15:55.750
Not you, Amy.

16:03.583 --> 16:04.791
HANNAH: Star jumps.

16:05.375 --> 16:12.041
One, two, three, four, five, six.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.083
Asha, concentrate.

16:14.166 --> 16:19.125
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

16:19.958 --> 16:21.583
Reach and stretch.

16:21.666 --> 16:22.500
One.

16:23.666 --> 16:24.666
Two.

16:25.666 --> 16:26.625
Three.

(pensive music playing)

16:46.583 --> 16:47.791
One.

16:48.333 --> 16:49.166
Two.

16:57.333 --> 16:58.833
Yeah. Sounds really good.

16:59.833 --> 17:02.833
-And me and Harry found an ant nest.
-What kind of ants?

17:02.916 --> 17:04.208
-CHRISTINE: Billy!
-Nan!

17:04.291 --> 17:05.875
My little man, hi.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.166
Oh, come here, you.

17:08.208 --> 17:09.958
Oh, my gosh.

17:10.041 --> 17:11.583
Look at you.

17:11.666 --> 17:13.916
-It's getting so big.
-What are you doing here?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.833
I... yeah, uh...

17:17.458 --> 17:19.250
Some mail came for you.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.416
I figured you'd be at school pick up.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.333
It looked important.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.500
Thanks for dropping it off.
Come on, Billy.

17:29.583 --> 17:31.250
Is Nan coming to our place?

17:31.333 --> 17:33.625
(student indistinct chatter)

18:09.458 --> 18:11.625
(motorcycle engine rumbles)

18:28.833 --> 18:30.416
HENRIK: Didn't you see the sign?

18:30.541 --> 18:32.500
Detective Senior Constable Saad.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.208
I know who you are.

18:35.208 --> 18:36.916
This is your property, isn't it?

18:38.125 --> 18:41.666
-Henrik.
-I look after it for the owner.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.250
She inside?

18:43.750 --> 18:44.958
Hmm.

18:45.875 --> 18:46.916
Not here.

18:49.625 --> 18:51.708
Can I help you with something, Officer?

18:53.916 --> 18:56.375
We're conducting door-to-door inquiries
in the area

18:56.458 --> 18:59.833
for the schoolgirl abducted
from Woodfield.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.083
You probably saw it on the news.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.875
A witness saw a white van driving
in town in recent days.

19:14.958 --> 19:15.958
Not local.

19:17.291 --> 19:20.000
You have a white van registered
in your name, isn't that right?

19:20.083 --> 19:22.750
There's a few of those around, Detective.

19:22.833 --> 19:24.041
(scoffs)

19:26.250 --> 19:28.833
-Is that the Blue Devils?
-Shh. Annabelle.

19:30.208 --> 19:32.333
What's the Blue Devils?

19:32.416 --> 19:34.166
The bad men
who want to put us in hessian bags

19:34.250 --> 19:35.958
and take us away to torture us.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.666
SARA (shouting): Help! Down here!

19:43.750 --> 19:45.750
-(Sara groans)
-(Anton grunts)

19:45.833 --> 19:48.250
Be quiet,
or you'll never make another sound.

19:51.250 --> 19:54.000
Would you mind, Henrik, if...

19:54.583 --> 19:55.916
we do a bit of a look inside?

19:56.500 --> 19:57.958
No, you're most welcome.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.541
But I assume that you have a warrant.

20:06.375 --> 20:07.708
(Sara sighs)

20:23.416 --> 20:24.625
(door opens)

20:26.041 --> 20:28.041
(footsteps approaching)

20:31.750 --> 20:32.875
(sighs)

20:32.958 --> 20:34.125
You're safe now.

20:35.166 --> 20:36.166
(muttering)

20:38.250 --> 20:41.625
-You coming, Asha?
-My name is Sara.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.375
Sara is gone.
Sooner you get used to it, the better.

20:50.208 --> 20:53.208
-BILLY: Mom, is Nan still following us?
-FREYA: Mm-hm.

20:55.416 --> 20:56.791
Mom?

20:56.875 --> 20:59.458
How come Nan's never been to our place?

21:00.541 --> 21:03.708
Well, we go to her place for Christmas.

21:10.541 --> 21:12.750
(gasping)

21:18.500 --> 21:20.541
Tucked away in here, aren't ya?

21:22.583 --> 21:23.791
(exhales deeply)

21:27.833 --> 21:29.666
(Billy grunts)

21:29.750 --> 21:32.333
-CHRISTINE: Uh, so this is Leo.
-BILLY: Hey, Leo.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.791
-Hey, Leo.
-Hi, Leo.

21:37.875 --> 21:39.291
This is, uh...

21:42.541 --> 21:45.458
I have to say, I wasn't expecting this.

21:45.541 --> 21:49.250
Yeah, we like it. It's peaceful. Private.

21:49.333 --> 21:51.166
-BILLY: Mom?
-Hm?

21:51.583 --> 21:52.833
I'm hungry.

21:55.791 --> 21:56.791
You're gonna open that?

21:57.708 --> 22:00.500
Mom? What can I eat?

22:00.583 --> 22:01.625
I don't know.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.583
CHRISTINE: Abigail was getting married
by the look of it.

22:04.666 --> 22:05.958
I noticed the return details.

22:06.041 --> 22:07.250
-BILLY: Mom.
-I wasn't prying.

22:07.333 --> 22:08.875
BILLY: Mom?

22:09.708 --> 22:11.791
Is Nan staying for dinner?

22:11.875 --> 22:14.500
Uh, no, Christine has
a very long drive home.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.375
Why doesn't anyone ask what I want?

22:17.875 --> 22:19.000
(door slams)

22:19.083 --> 22:21.208
CHRISTINE: Boy needs other people, Freya.

22:21.291 --> 22:23.500
You can't keep him wrapped up
in cotton wool.

22:23.583 --> 22:26.458
Hey, Billy. Come on.

22:26.541 --> 22:27.875
Open the door, Billy.

22:27.958 --> 22:29.458
(knocking)

22:29.541 --> 22:31.458
Billy, come on. Let Mommy in.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.375
He gets like this when he's overtired.

22:36.958 --> 22:38.458
Billy, open the door.

22:41.083 --> 22:42.125
-Ooh.
-(Billy yelps)

22:42.958 --> 22:44.875
-(Billy grunts)
-(pants)

22:46.333 --> 22:48.500
-Okay, hang on, hang on.
-Let me see, let me see.

22:49.541 --> 22:51.666
You're okay. You're okay.

22:51.750 --> 22:54.583
Hey, if you had listened to what I said,
this wouldn't have happened, would it?

22:54.666 --> 22:56.041
-You did it on purpose.
-Here.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.375
No, I didn't.
It was an accident. Billy? Here.

22:58.458 --> 22:59.458
Chuck this on.

22:59.541 --> 23:00.666
-(groans in pain)
-Hold this on.

23:00.750 --> 23:02.208
You're such a brave boy.

23:02.291 --> 23:04.791
That, that must've really hurt.
Here you go.

23:04.875 --> 23:07.166
All right, that should do it. There we go.
It's not so bad.

23:08.291 --> 23:09.875
-Okay.
-It's okay. It's all right.

23:09.958 --> 23:12.333
Hey, Billy.
Why don't you show Nan your room?

23:12.416 --> 23:14.625
CHRISTINE:
Do you want to do that? Come on.

23:14.708 --> 23:15.708
There we go.

23:15.791 --> 23:17.791
-(ominous music)
-(indistinct chatter)

23:17.875 --> 23:19.041
(engine rumbles)

23:19.958 --> 23:22.291
CHRISTINE:
Ooh, we go up the stairs, darling.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.375
-I'm just going to get some fresh air.
-Okay.

23:24.458 --> 23:25.875
-Stay.
-CHRISTINE: Here we go.

23:28.291 --> 23:30.458
(ominous music playing)

23:31.041 --> 23:32.250
(breathes deeply)

23:33.416 --> 23:35.625
(birds chirping)

23:42.916 --> 23:45.000
(ominous music continues playing)

23:50.750 --> 23:52.000
(sighs)

23:59.708 --> 24:01.916
(dog barking in distance)

24:08.708 --> 24:10.375
HENRIK: Why didn't you tell me?

24:10.458 --> 24:12.625
Heck, they are looking for
a white van, Hannah.

24:12.708 --> 24:15.916
Tamsin says there's lots of white vans.
It's like a needle in a haystack.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.375
-What was she thinking?
-She wasn't!

24:18.458 --> 24:21.166
-Only that Adrienne wants more.
-But not like this.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.750
You know we need to wait.

24:22.833 --> 24:25.083
We need to wait for an adoption
at the hospital.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.375
Henrik.

24:26.458 --> 24:27.750
You know, that loophole's been closed.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.250
-Annabelle was the last one.
-(distant singing)

24:29.333 --> 24:30.791
Well then, we foster.

24:30.875 --> 24:33.250
You know, we talk to our members
at The Lodge.

24:33.333 --> 24:35.500
KIDS: ♪ Atishoo, atishoo ♪

24:35.583 --> 24:36.916
It's a crime, Hannah.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.791
And what about the adoptions?
The falsified papers? What were they?

24:40.458 --> 24:42.500
It's not some unwanted child!

24:42.583 --> 24:48.541
KIDS: ♪ Full of posies, atishoo, atishoo
We all fall down ♪

24:50.416 --> 24:54.708
♪ Ring-a-ring-a-rosie
A pocket full of posies ♪

24:54.791 --> 24:57.708
♪ Atishoo, atishoo, we all fall down ♪

24:57.791 --> 25:01.458
Can't you see that this could ruin
everything that we're doing here?

25:06.666 --> 25:07.916
What if it did?

25:10.083 --> 25:15.458
What if her parents come looking for her?
Then all of this has to end.

25:18.750 --> 25:21.750
I'm going to pretend
you didn't just say that.

25:28.958 --> 25:30.750
We need to tell Maitreya.

25:34.125 --> 25:36.541
We could go to jail for this.

25:36.625 --> 25:42.000
KIDS: ♪ Ring-a-ring-a-rosie
A pocket full of posies, atishoo ♪

25:43.291 --> 25:45.333
-See you, Billy.
-Bye, Nan.

25:47.916 --> 25:49.833
-How's your eye?
-It's okay.

25:50.541 --> 25:51.666
Let me see.

25:53.708 --> 25:56.541
Hey, if anyone asks you
at school tomorrow,

25:56.625 --> 25:58.666
that was an accident.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.833
-You know that, don't you?
-Mm-hmm.

26:00.916 --> 26:01.791
Yeah.

26:02.875 --> 26:05.125
I'll never let anything happen
to you, Bilbo.

26:05.208 --> 26:06.291
Mm-hm.

26:09.625 --> 26:11.208
TAMSIN: Virabhadrasana one.

26:11.291 --> 26:13.125
(indistinct chatter)

26:13.583 --> 26:14.958
Virabhadrasana two.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.375
(chatter continues)

26:16.916 --> 26:18.583
Trikanasana.

26:19.250 --> 26:21.208
Belly button toward your spine, Alisha.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.166
Annabelle, tummy in.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.458
(indistinct chatter)

26:27.541 --> 26:29.583
Amy, lower.

26:29.666 --> 26:32.541
(Sara panting)

26:38.958 --> 26:40.208
HANNAH: What are you doing?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.500
I'm calling my mom to come and get me.

26:57.166 --> 26:58.875
She'll never find you here.

26:58.958 --> 27:01.333
Well then,
I'll wait for her at Blackmarsh Road.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.791
(car approaching)

27:13.041 --> 27:15.958
(crow cawing)

27:19.666 --> 27:22.833
First, we release the girl
in a national park.

27:23.958 --> 27:26.000
Somewhere she'll be found. No trace.

27:26.083 --> 27:28.291
TAMSIN:
But her hair. They'll see her hair.

27:29.625 --> 27:30.791
BRYCE: Can't you dye it back?

27:30.875 --> 27:32.333
HANNAH: She knows exactly where we are.

27:32.416 --> 27:34.208
If she goes back, then they'll find us.

27:34.291 --> 27:35.250
(Bryce sighs)

27:36.000 --> 27:39.125
You have put the kindred in grave danger.

27:39.208 --> 27:40.958
I was just trying to help.

27:41.041 --> 27:43.583
Yes, well, you will answer to Maitreya
for what you've done.

27:44.958 --> 27:47.041
(light music playing)

27:51.083 --> 27:53.083
(birds chirping)

28:01.458 --> 28:02.666
BRYCE: Welcome home.

28:02.750 --> 28:05.458
In the middle of
a Vipassana Healing, Bryce.

28:09.416 --> 28:11.750
TAMSIN: I chose her carefully.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.625
For you, Maitreya.

28:15.500 --> 28:20.458
I, uh... I watched her,
and I made sure no one saw us.

28:20.541 --> 28:22.666
ADRIENNE: Did you?
Is that why it's all over the news?

28:24.875 --> 28:26.750
TAMSIN: I didn't mean to let you down.

28:27.791 --> 28:31.333
Everyone thinks you should be cast out.
Ex-communicated.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.041
What do you think
I should do with you, Tamsin?

28:43.750 --> 28:45.958
And you wonder why your husband left you.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.000
ADRIENNE: Send Amy in.

28:48.083 --> 28:49.916
(footsteps receding)

28:55.375 --> 28:57.625
This child must be made one of us now.

28:58.208 --> 28:59.083
Yes.

28:59.666 --> 29:01.500
It's the only way.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.500
-You wanted to see me, Mommy?
-Come, sit.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.416
Thank you, Doctor.

29:13.041 --> 29:14.333
Closer.

29:16.958 --> 29:18.083
(door closes)

29:22.833 --> 29:23.958
Amy.

29:26.375 --> 29:28.708
You're my big girl now. Hm?

29:30.250 --> 29:32.375
On the cusp of womanhood.

29:33.750 --> 29:36.750
Where you are now is like a season,

29:37.541 --> 29:39.500
the season of your unfoldment.

29:42.458 --> 29:43.666
Do you understand?

29:44.708 --> 29:45.750
Hm.

29:47.791 --> 29:50.583
One day you will have a child of your own.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.916
One we can raise at Blackmarsh.

29:55.625 --> 29:56.583
Would you like that?

29:57.375 --> 29:58.583
Yes, Mommy.

29:58.666 --> 30:02.625
But first, you must show me
that you can take care of Asha.

30:03.791 --> 30:05.791
I'm putting you in charge.

30:06.458 --> 30:09.041
It's up to you to help her learn our ways.

30:10.958 --> 30:12.291
Can you do that for me, Amy?

30:13.500 --> 30:14.541
Yes, Mommy.

30:16.625 --> 30:18.125
(sighs)

30:22.666 --> 30:25.291
(breathes deeply)

30:32.583 --> 30:34.500
Do you ever miss this?

30:35.291 --> 30:38.750
-Us.
-You mustn't question, Tamsin.

30:40.250 --> 30:42.833
In her wisdom, Maitreya knows.

30:45.583 --> 30:47.833
We are on the path, all of us.

30:50.583 --> 30:51.875
(sniffs)

30:54.791 --> 30:56.791
(sobs)

31:00.458 --> 31:02.333
You have to evolve.

31:05.083 --> 31:08.833
Adrienne can, can walk through time.

31:09.875 --> 31:12.916
What if the Blue Devils come back
with a warrant?

31:13.541 --> 31:15.833
We have people in place. It's in hand.

31:17.250 --> 31:20.291
If she casts me out, where will I go?

31:31.208 --> 31:32.916
You're my special one.

31:34.208 --> 31:38.000
None of the others get to come here
and see Mommy like you.

31:39.958 --> 31:42.250
I know you won't disappoint me.

31:50.625 --> 31:51.958
ADRIENNE: My children.

31:52.041 --> 31:54.916
You are the initiate.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.916
I'm looking directly into each one of you.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.708
Keeping you safe from the outside world
with all its cruelty and misery.

32:04.791 --> 32:07.041
You are my kindred.

32:07.125 --> 32:12.416
The chosen ones set forth
on the path to perfection.

32:13.166 --> 32:14.291
-Hold my hand...
-Hey!

32:14.375 --> 32:17.000
...and I would lead you
into the awakening.

32:21.958 --> 32:24.750
(grunting)
No!

32:24.833 --> 32:26.583
SARA: Get off me!

32:27.916 --> 32:29.083
No!

32:29.708 --> 32:32.000
-(chanting)
-Stop!

32:32.083 --> 32:33.375
Let me go!

32:34.291 --> 32:35.916
-SARA: No!
-TAMSIN: Let's go.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
SARA: I wanna go home!

32:38.083 --> 32:40.791
No! Stop!

32:48.250 --> 32:51.333
You have caused me a lot of trouble,
do you know that?

32:52.625 --> 32:56.083
When you disrespect Maitreya,

32:56.708 --> 32:58.708
that's where I draw the line.

32:58.791 --> 33:00.583
-Not now.
-AMY: Aunty Tamsin, it's me.

33:00.666 --> 33:02.541
Mommy said I have to
look after my little sister.

33:02.625 --> 33:05.250
-Go away, Amy!
-She said I'm in charge of her.

33:05.333 --> 33:06.875
She said I must teach her our ways.

33:08.333 --> 33:10.333
(Sara breathes deeply)

33:14.208 --> 33:16.541
(Tamsin pants)

33:26.541 --> 33:28.083
I won't let anyone hurt you.

33:31.083 --> 33:33.708
(key clanks)

33:37.791 --> 33:38.708
What is it?

33:38.791 --> 33:40.791
The key to my home.

33:41.958 --> 33:43.750
But this is your home.

33:43.833 --> 33:46.666
No, I hate it here.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.583
Don't say that.

33:49.333 --> 33:51.541
I'm not allowed to let you say that.

33:51.625 --> 33:54.583
At home, I have friends.

33:54.875 --> 33:56.333
I go to a school.

33:56.958 --> 33:58.833
I get kisses goodnight.

33:59.541 --> 34:02.375
When I'm hungry,
I can just open the fridge.

34:02.916 --> 34:06.833
I have dolls, toys, television...

34:09.500 --> 34:10.625
Don't lie to me.

34:11.416 --> 34:13.541
Mommy says we only have room
for the truth inside.

34:19.875 --> 34:22.791
People can be cruel
and kind at the same time, Asha.

34:25.083 --> 34:26.208
You will learn that.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.125
My name is Sara!

34:37.208 --> 34:39.541
(ominous music playing)

34:46.541 --> 34:49.125
(cawing)

34:52.625 --> 34:54.708
(ominous music continues playing)

34:58.208 --> 35:00.166
(pants)

35:04.416 --> 35:05.666
(exhales deeply)

35:10.916 --> 35:12.916
(lock rattles)

35:19.750 --> 35:21.958
(telephone ringing)

35:25.333 --> 35:27.333
(breathes deeply)

35:31.833 --> 35:32.833
JOE: Freya.

35:32.916 --> 35:35.083
Look, I know
what you're going to say, but...

35:36.291 --> 35:39.500
there's a white van parked
by the lake near my house.

35:41.041 --> 35:43.541
It's just like the one on the news
with the missing girl.

35:44.958 --> 35:46.583
I have a bad feeling, Joe.

35:47.958 --> 35:49.791
I thought maybe you could...

35:51.041 --> 35:53.083
pull a few favors or something.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.708
You believe me, don't you?

36:00.208 --> 36:01.583
JOE: Haven't I always?

36:02.958 --> 36:05.125
I'll get the local cops to do a drive-by.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.916
-Thanks.
-JOE: Okay.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.125
(bell clanking)

36:26.666 --> 36:27.958
You may sit.

36:28.041 --> 36:29.500
(chairs screech)

36:42.333 --> 36:44.625
(utensils clanking)

36:51.208 --> 36:52.333
HANNAH (shouts): Angela!

36:52.833 --> 36:54.041
Elbows.

37:00.208 --> 37:01.416
Asha?

37:01.791 --> 37:04.000
Your mother is on the phone for you.

37:05.666 --> 37:06.791
(thuds)

37:07.541 --> 37:09.541
(Sara sobs)

37:20.000 --> 37:23.125
And why does Amy get more?
I helped get Asha too!

37:28.375 --> 37:29.500
Mom?

37:30.166 --> 37:33.000
Hello, angel. It's Mommy.

37:33.541 --> 37:35.166
I've been waiting for you.

37:35.791 --> 37:38.833
(breathes deeply)
You're not my mom.

37:38.916 --> 37:41.250
(light music playing)

37:48.083 --> 37:50.625
I'm so sorry, Adrienne.

37:51.958 --> 37:54.625
It seems Amy has failed you.

37:59.416 --> 38:02.083
(light music continues playing)

38:27.375 --> 38:30.791
(grunts)

38:36.583 --> 38:38.875
(footsteps approaching)

38:41.375 --> 38:43.791
(Amy grunting over phone)

38:50.125 --> 38:52.833
-Seems I'll have to fix this myself.
-(grunting over phone continues)

38:52.916 --> 38:56.041
-Is that a good idea?
-What choice do we have?

39:01.125 --> 39:02.208
(thuds)

39:03.583 --> 39:06.000
(crickets creaking)

39:34.500 --> 39:35.625
(door closes)

39:35.708 --> 39:37.708

39:53.041 --> 39:55.250

40:24.583 --> 40:26.208
-(car door closes)
-(gasps)

40:31.583 --> 40:34.208
(panting)

40:48.458 --> 40:49.875
(gasps)

40:51.416 --> 40:52.416
(sighs deeply)

40:59.125 --> 41:01.541
(insects creaking)

41:06.166 --> 41:07.208
(exhales deeply)

41:29.791 --> 41:30.958
(door opens)

41:41.083 --> 41:42.500

41:47.958 --> 41:50.375
(suspenseful music playing)

41:58.625 --> 42:02.041

42:10.500 --> 42:12.750
(suspenseful music continues playing)

42:44.583 --> 42:45.791
(thudding in distance)

43:03.458 --> 43:05.541
(creaking)

43:05.625 --> 43:06.875
(sighs)

43:22.041 --> 43:24.458

43:26.125 --> 43:27.958
TAMSIN: Where is she?

43:28.041 --> 43:30.666
-Where is she?
-I don't know, Aunty.

43:30.750 --> 43:32.458
TAMSIN: She's gone.

43:32.541 --> 43:33.583
How?

43:33.666 --> 43:35.875
(Tamsin pants)

43:37.666 --> 43:39.041
Search the grounds.

43:39.125 --> 43:40.791
All of you, find her!

43:41.666 --> 43:42.916
Get dressed.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.208
TAMSIN: Hurry!

43:45.750 --> 43:47.083
(door closes)

43:47.458 --> 43:48.541
(door thuds)

43:49.750 --> 43:52.041
(light music playing)

43:59.041 --> 44:00.125
Hey!

44:05.416 --> 44:06.541
Wait.

44:06.625 --> 44:09.416
(panting)

44:09.500 --> 44:11.500
(ominous music playing)

44:11.583 --> 44:13.583

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Billy.

44:38.083 --> 44:40.291
(grunting)

44:46.250 --> 44:47.083
Billy?

44:52.958 --> 44:54.208
(sighs)

44:54.500 --> 44:55.375
What?

44:55.458 --> 44:56.583
Oh.

44:57.208 --> 44:58.666
-BILLY: What?
-(sighs)

44:58.750 --> 44:59.875
Oh, God.

45:01.208 --> 45:02.291
Oh, God.

45:03.125 --> 45:04.166
(sighs)

45:10.208 --> 45:11.458
BILLY: There's Harry.

45:16.625 --> 45:17.875
HARRY: Hi, Billy.

-Hi, Harry. Bye, Mom.
-Bye-bye.

45:28.208 --> 45:29.333
(Freya grunts)

Hey, it's only me. I got your shopping.

(woman softly hums)

46:05.791 --> 46:08.250
(humming continues)

46:13.750 --> 46:15.000
How is she today?

46:15.083 --> 46:16.375
Demanding.

46:16.458 --> 46:18.416
But just the one accident this morning.

46:18.500 --> 46:19.583
(sighs)

46:20.416 --> 46:23.833
Mom, you being nice to Mo, hm?

46:23.916 --> 46:26.750
MO: We were just about to do
a jigsaw puzzle, weren't we?

46:27.083 --> 46:29.000
Mother bird knows when it's time

46:29.083 --> 46:32.375
for the baby bird to be pushed out
of the nest.

46:34.583 --> 46:35.875
You're a dead bird.

46:50.916 --> 46:51.833
(exhales deeply)

46:58.458 --> 47:02.208
You're my big girl now, Amy.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.041
