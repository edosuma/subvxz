02:24.181 --> 02:26.617
Once upon this same earth,

02:26.685 --> 02:29.121
beneath this same sun,

02:29.190 --> 02:31.092
long before you...

02:31.161 --> 02:35.100
before the ape
and the elephant as well,

02:35.168 --> 02:39.130
before the wolf,
the bison, the whale,

02:39.208 --> 02:42.611
before the mammoth
and the mastodon

02:42.680 --> 02:45.709
in the time
of the dinosaurs.

02:47.222 --> 02:48.622
Come on!

02:48.691 --> 02:51.127
Dinosaurs
were of two kinds -

02:51.196 --> 02:56.160
Some had flat teeth
and ate the leaves of trees.

02:56.238 --> 02:59.676
Some had sharp teeth
for eating meat.

02:59.743 --> 03:02.647
They preyed upon
the leaf-eaters.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.151
Then leaves began to die.

03:05.221 --> 03:09.160
The mighty beasts,
who appeared to rule earth,

03:09.228 --> 03:12.666
were ruled, in truth,
by the leaf.

03:12.733 --> 03:14.167
Desperate for food,

03:14.236 --> 03:16.428
some dinosaur herds

03:16.429 --> 03:17.988
struck out toward the west,

03:18.065 --> 03:20.501
searching for
their Great Valley,

03:20.569 --> 03:23.540
a land still lush and green.

03:23.608 --> 03:26.603
lt was a journey toward life.

03:34.126 --> 03:37.565
lt was a march of many dangers.

03:37.633 --> 03:39.569
Sharpteeth stalked the herds,

03:39.637 --> 03:42.540
waiting to seize
any who strayed.

03:42.608 --> 03:47.139
The leaf-eaters stopped only
to hatch their young.

03:54.462 --> 03:55.487
Ha.

03:56.700 --> 03:57.632
Aah.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.869
Ha ha ha!

04:17.336 --> 04:19.305
Ha ha ha. Mama.

04:19.373 --> 04:20.432
Hmm.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.449
Mmm.

04:26.518 --> 04:27.451
[Giggling]

04:27.520 --> 04:29.489
Mmm.

04:29.558 --> 04:31.493
Mmm.

04:31.561 --> 04:34.157
[Giggling]

04:34.232 --> 04:35.165
[Grrr]

04:35.234 --> 04:36.497
[Grrr]

04:36.570 --> 04:37.799
Aah!

04:44.217 --> 04:45.685
Ha ha ha.

04:45.753 --> 04:46.778
[Grrr]

04:49.225 --> 04:53.256
Some of the young
seemed born without fear.

04:57.740 --> 04:59.208
[Thunder]

04:59.276 --> 05:00.403
Aah!

05:23.820 --> 05:24.752
Yet...

05:24.821 --> 05:25.880
[Arrr]

05:25.956 --> 05:28.654
even hatching could be dangerous.

05:51.335 --> 05:54.773
One herd had only a single baby,

05:54.840 --> 05:57.869
their last hope for the future.

06:00.416 --> 06:01.817
Ha ha ha.

06:01.887 --> 06:03.788
And they called him...

06:03.856 --> 06:05.347
Littlefoot.

06:08.197 --> 06:09.689
Here l am.

06:11.603 --> 06:12.866
Aw.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.464
Ha ha ha.

06:45.463 --> 06:47.022
Don't be frightened.

06:47.099 --> 06:48.624
Come out.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.771
[Chattering]

07:01.825 --> 07:04.625
Mmm.

07:15.482 --> 07:17.008
Ha ha ha.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.625
All that remained
of his herd

07:21.693 --> 07:23.321
was his mother,

07:23.396 --> 07:25.366
grandmother and his grandfather.

07:25.433 --> 07:27.835
He knew them by sight,

07:27.904 --> 07:30.841
by scent and by their love.

07:30.909 --> 07:34.370
He knew they would
be together always.

07:34.449 --> 07:37.887
Now, you be careful,
my Littlefoot.

07:37.954 --> 07:40.424
Ahh.

07:42.897 --> 07:44.764
Heh heh heh.

07:47.071 --> 07:48.563
Aah.

07:56.053 --> 07:57.886
Beautiful Littlefoot.

08:04.535 --> 08:08.474
Mother, is this
all there is to eat?

08:08.542 --> 08:10.511
l'm sorry, my dear.

08:10.579 --> 08:12.981
The land has been changing.

08:13.050 --> 08:19.483
That is why we must walk
as far as we can each day

08:19.561 --> 08:22.589
until we reach the Great Valley.

08:25.304 --> 08:27.934
Littlefoot, quickly, come here.

08:29.613 --> 08:31.172
Look, up there.

08:32.618 --> 08:34.143
A tree star.

08:35.289 --> 08:37.316
lt is very special.

08:49.314 --> 08:51.910
[Giggling]

08:51.985 --> 08:53.578
A tree star.

08:53.655 --> 08:55.624
lt is very special.

08:55.691 --> 08:58.093
lt'll help you grow strong.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.098
Where we are going,

09:00.166 --> 09:03.696
there are so many
of these leaves.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.739
Come along.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.646
Ha ha ha.

09:12.721 --> 09:16.125
The valley is filled
with green food,

09:16.194 --> 09:19.131
more than you could ever eat

09:19.199 --> 09:21.135
and more cool water

09:21.203 --> 09:23.969
than you could ever drink.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.511
lt's a wonderful,
beautiful place,

09:26.579 --> 09:28.514
where we'll live happily

09:28.582 --> 09:32.021
with many more of our own kind.

09:32.089 --> 09:33.991
When will we arrive?

09:34.059 --> 09:37.998
The bright circle
must pass over many times.

09:38.066 --> 09:40.035
We must follow it

09:40.103 --> 09:43.097
to where it touches the ground.

09:45.245 --> 09:48.775
Have you ever seen
the Great Valley?

09:51.757 --> 09:52.952
No.

09:54.428 --> 09:58.458
Well, how do you know
it's really there?

09:59.771 --> 10:03.232
Some things you see
with your eyes,

10:03.311 --> 10:06.214
others you see
with your heart.

10:06.282 --> 10:08.684
l don't understand, Mother.

10:10.790 --> 10:12.726
You will, my son.

10:12.794 --> 10:14.558
You will.

10:18.337 --> 10:19.828
[Giggling]

10:22.912 --> 10:25.940
Littlefoot,
don't you wander too far.

10:45.852 --> 10:47.218
Hey!

10:56.537 --> 10:59.531
Ha ha ha!

10:59.609 --> 11:02.011
What are you laughing at?

11:02.080 --> 11:03.606
Oh!

11:10.929 --> 11:12.261
[Honk]

11:13.300 --> 11:15.292
[Grrr]

11:17.441 --> 11:20.037
[Grrr]

11:20.112 --> 11:22.378
[Grrr]

11:23.919 --> 11:25.182
Littlefoot.

11:25.254 --> 11:26.882
Come, Cera.

11:26.957 --> 11:31.921
Three-horns never play
with long-necks.

11:31.999 --> 11:33.661
Pffft!

11:33.736 --> 11:34.704
Littlefoot.

11:34.771 --> 11:36.399
[Grrr]

11:36.474 --> 11:40.778
Three-horns never play
with long-necks.

11:45.991 --> 11:47.926
A long-neck?

11:47.994 --> 11:49.360
Hmm.

11:49.430 --> 11:52.869
Mother, what's a long-neck?

11:52.936 --> 11:55.873
Why, that's what we are, dear.

11:55.941 --> 11:58.878
Oh. Well, why can't l play

11:58.947 --> 12:00.381
with that three-horn?

12:00.450 --> 12:02.442
We were having fun.

12:02.520 --> 12:05.959
We all keep to our own kind -

12:06.026 --> 12:07.961
The three-horns, the spiketails,

12:08.029 --> 12:09.965
the swimmers, the fliers.

12:10.033 --> 12:13.129
We never do anything together.

12:13.205 --> 12:14.799
Why?

12:14.875 --> 12:16.810
Well, because we're different.

12:16.878 --> 12:19.348
lt's always been that way.

12:19.416 --> 12:20.975
Well, why?

12:21.052 --> 12:23.454
Oh, don't worry so much.

12:23.523 --> 12:26.460
When we reach the Great Valley,

12:26.528 --> 12:28.964
there will be many long-necks

12:29.033 --> 12:31.503
for you to play with.

12:31.571 --> 12:34.474
l wish we were there now.

12:34.543 --> 12:36.478
lt's a long way -

12:36.546 --> 12:40.007
Past the rock that
looks like a long-neck,

12:40.086 --> 12:41.987
the mountains that burn.

12:42.056 --> 12:46.086
Still a long way,
but we'll get there.

13:01.957 --> 13:03.016
[Ribbit]

13:03.093 --> 13:04.288
Oh!

13:07.133 --> 13:08.932
[Ribbit]

13:09.004 --> 13:11.531
Hey, hopper, come back!

13:14.146 --> 13:15.078
[Ribbit]

13:15.147 --> 13:16.137
Hey.

13:17.985 --> 13:19.078
You again?

13:19.154 --> 13:20.554
Go away!

13:20.623 --> 13:23.059
That's my hopper.

13:23.128 --> 13:26.066
l... l saw him first.

13:26.134 --> 13:28.900
Well, he's in my pond.

13:28.972 --> 13:30.497
[Ribbit]

13:32.177 --> 13:33.577
[Ribbit]

13:38.021 --> 13:39.148
[Ribbit]

13:40.859 --> 13:42.020
[Ribbit]

13:45.741 --> 13:46.799
[Ribbit]

13:46.875 --> 13:48.310
Ha ha ha!

13:48.379 --> 13:49.847
Ha ha ha!

13:49.915 --> 13:51.178
[Ribbit]

13:51.250 --> 13:52.650
Over here.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.655
Hey, this is fun.

13:54.723 --> 13:56.157
Ha ha ha!

13:56.226 --> 13:57.660
Ha ha ha!

13:57.729 --> 13:59.163
[Heavy Footsteps]

13:59.231 --> 14:00.756
Ha ha ha!

14:05.776 --> 14:06.869
Ohh!

14:08.781 --> 14:11.274
Ohh! Sharptooth!

14:12.755 --> 14:14.189
Help!

14:14.257 --> 14:17.023

[Grrr]

14:43.843 --> 14:45.141
[Grrr]

14:49.152 --> 14:50.176
Go.

14:55.997 --> 14:57.431
This way.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.433
Mm-mmm.

14:58.502 --> 15:02.031
Come back.
You're going the wrong way!

15:04.011 --> 15:05.036
Aah!

15:06.716 --> 15:07.684
Whoa!

15:07.751 --> 15:08.649
Ohh!

Mm-ohh!

[Grrr]

15:31.526 --> 15:32.494
Mother?

15:32.562 --> 15:33.551
Run!

15:37.436 --> 15:39.463
Look out!

15:52.463 --> 15:53.829
Aah!

16:18.175 --> 16:19.165
Ohh!

16:37.042 --> 16:38.408
Oh!

16:52.201 --> 16:53.863
- Help!
- Help!

16:53.937 --> 16:55.166
[Grrr]

16:55.240 --> 16:57.870

Aah!

[Grrr]

17:36.546 --> 17:38.982
Daddy!

17:39.051 --> 17:40.211
Aah!

17:40.286 --> 17:44.225
ln this time
of the clash of continents,

17:44.293 --> 17:46.728
an earthquake split the land.

17:46.797 --> 17:50.759
Herds were divided,
families were cut in two.

17:50.838 --> 17:53.832
Littlefoot was separated
from his grandparents.

18:01.724 --> 18:03.283
Cera!

18:03.360 --> 18:04.794
Mama! Daddy!

18:04.862 --> 18:08.665
Cera was on one side
of the divide,

18:08.736 --> 18:11.707
her parents
were on the other.

18:15.014 --> 18:17.246
Mother!

18:25.199 --> 18:27.498
Mother!

18:30.240 --> 18:31.299
Uh!

18:35.717 --> 18:37.015
Mother?

18:37.086 --> 18:39.214
Where are you?

18:40.391 --> 18:41.416
Oh.

18:43.396 --> 18:44.591
Mother.

18:46.569 --> 18:47.502
Mother?

18:47.571 --> 18:48.538
Oh.

18:48.606 --> 18:50.872
Please get up.

18:50.943 --> 18:52.138
l'm...

18:53.414 --> 18:55.850
not sure l can, Littlefoot.

18:55.919 --> 18:57.353
Yes, you can.

18:57.421 --> 18:58.946
Get up.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.410
Dear, sweet Littlefoot,

19:10.478 --> 19:14.884
do you remember the way
to the Great Valley?

19:14.952 --> 19:16.386
l guess so,

19:16.454 --> 19:19.426
but why do l have to know?

19:19.494 --> 19:22.260
You're going to be with me.

19:22.332 --> 19:24.267
l'll be with you,

19:24.335 --> 19:27.273
even if you can't see me.

19:27.341 --> 19:31.781
What do you mean
if l can't see you?

19:31.848 --> 19:34.284
l can always see you.

19:34.353 --> 19:37.917
Littlefoot,
let your heart guide you.

19:39.362 --> 19:40.853
lt whispers.

19:41.866 --> 19:43.425
So listen closely.

19:48.010 --> 19:50.811
Mother? Mother?

20:15.759 --> 20:17.022
Mmm.

20:17.095 --> 20:18.255
Mmmmm.

20:20.534 --> 20:21.695
Hey!

20:23.740 --> 20:25.208
What's going on here?

20:25.276 --> 20:26.403
[Crying]

20:26.478 --> 20:28.538
What's your problem?

20:28.615 --> 20:30.106
You're not hurt.

20:30.184 --> 20:32.211
lt's not fair.

20:32.288 --> 20:34.520
She should have known better.

20:34.592 --> 20:37.028
That was a sharptooth.

20:37.097 --> 20:39.066
lt's all her fault.

20:39.133 --> 20:41.103
All whose fault?

20:41.171 --> 20:42.264
Mother's.

20:42.339 --> 20:45.139
Oh...

20:46.213 --> 20:49.309
l see. l see.

20:49.385 --> 20:53.222
Why did l wander
so far from home?

20:53.292 --> 20:55.728
Oh, it's not your fault.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.232
lt's not your mother's fault.

20:58.301 --> 21:01.466
You pay attention to old Rooter.

21:01.539 --> 21:04.670
lt is nobody's fault.

21:04.745 --> 21:08.148
The great circle
of life has begun,

21:08.218 --> 21:09.686
but, you see,

21:09.753 --> 21:14.160
not all of us arrive
together at the end.

21:14.229 --> 21:15.663
What'll l do?

21:15.731 --> 21:18.167
l miss her so much.

21:18.236 --> 21:20.205
You'll always miss her,

21:20.272 --> 21:23.176
but she'll always be with you

21:23.245 --> 21:26.705
if you remember
what she taught you.

21:26.783 --> 21:29.185
You'll never really be apart,

21:29.255 --> 21:33.194
for you're still
a part of each other.

21:33.262 --> 21:34.856
My tummy hurts.

21:34.932 --> 21:39.634
Well, that, too,
will go in time, little fella...

21:39.706 --> 21:41.231
only in time.

22:49.829 --> 22:51.263
At first,

22:51.333 --> 22:54.771
Littlefoot could only
think about his mother.

22:54.838 --> 22:57.274
He hardly noticed his hunger

22:57.343 --> 23:01.841
and forgot that he must
reach the Great Valley.

23:01.918 --> 23:03.386
[Peep Peep]

Littlefoot.

23:54.009 --> 23:55.602
Littlefoot.

24:13.372 --> 24:14.772
Dear Littlefoot,

24:14.842 --> 24:19.373
do you remember the way
to the Great Valley?

24:20.885 --> 24:22.787
Follow the bright circle

24:22.856 --> 24:27.820
past the great rock
that looks like a long-neck

24:27.898 --> 24:30.892
and past the mountains
that burn.

24:32.874 --> 24:35.902
l'll be in your heart,
Littlefoot.

24:36.881 --> 24:39.009
Let your heart guide you.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.830
[Gasp]

24:49.904 --> 24:51.132

Heh heh! lt's you!

25:04.596 --> 25:06.360
Wait, Mother!

25:06.432 --> 25:07.627
Wait!

25:23.963 --> 25:26.399
Then Littlefoot
knew for certain

25:26.467 --> 25:28.403
that he was alone

25:28.471 --> 25:31.442
and that though
the Great Valley

25:31.509 --> 25:32.909
was far away

25:32.979 --> 25:34.915
and the journey perilous,

25:34.983 --> 25:37.453
he'd have to find his way,

25:37.520 --> 25:41.425
or the chain of life
would be broken.

25:41.494 --> 25:42.689

Cera, hello.

25:49.508 --> 25:51.477
What do you want?

25:51.544 --> 25:53.946
Nothing. Where are you going?

25:54.016 --> 25:56.953
l'm going to find my own kind.

[Gasp]

26:20.595 --> 26:22.622
Aah!

so go away.

26:35.756 --> 26:38.784
Three-horns can
be very dangerous.

26:38.861 --> 26:41.798
They only talk with
other three-horns,

26:41.866 --> 26:45.361
and they only travel
with other three-horns.

27:29.216 --> 27:30.445

37:13.894 --> 37:15.226
Ducky!

37:20.306 --> 37:22.172
So the five
hungry dinosaurs

37:22.242 --> 37:24.644
left for the Great Valley.

37:24.713 --> 37:28.152
There had never been
such a herd before.

37:28.219 --> 37:30.154
A long-neck, a three-horn,

37:30.222 --> 37:34.663
a bigmouth,
a flier, and a spiketail,

37:34.731 --> 37:38.670
All knowing that
if they lost their way,

37:38.738 --> 37:40.172
they would starve

37:40.240 --> 37:43.701
or find themselves
in sharptooth's shadow.

37:48.254 --> 37:50.190
Hmm. Tree stars grow

37:50.258 --> 37:52.693
where there's lots of water.

37:52.763 --> 37:55.529
lf we follow this water...

37:55.601 --> 37:57.194
[Sniff Sniff]

37:57.270 --> 37:59.706
Hmm. No green foods here,

37:59.775 --> 38:02.211
and l still hungry.

38:02.279 --> 38:04.749
l'm still hungry, too.

38:04.817 --> 38:05.875
Aah!

38:05.953 --> 38:07.888

You smell me? Heh heh.

38:27.290 --> 38:28.724
Oh, look!

38:28.793 --> 38:30.227
Green food!

That way! Come on!

38:45.021 --> 38:45.954

39:09.865 --> 39:12.267
Look, look what they're doing!

39:12.336 --> 39:13.804
They're so greedy!

39:13.872 --> 39:15.272
What about me?

39:15.341 --> 39:16.775
l'm still hungry!

39:16.843 --> 39:18.243
Haah! You hungry?

39:18.312 --> 39:20.782
l empty to the top.

39:20.850 --> 39:23.286

39:23.355 --> 39:25.348

We be hungry forevers.

39:27.462 --> 39:28.521
Ohh!

39:28.597 --> 39:31.033
No, Petrie.
Cera was wrong.

39:31.102 --> 39:33.538
This isn't the Great Valley.

39:33.606 --> 39:37.170
Oh, it is not a great anything.

39:37.246 --> 39:38.680
Nope, nope, nope.

39:38.749 --> 39:40.718
We better go down

39:40.785 --> 39:43.187
and see if anything's left.

39:43.256 --> 39:46.695
Petrie, could you
fly up there and...

39:46.763 --> 39:47.696
No!

39:47.765 --> 39:50.201
Petrie, do not feel sad.

39:50.269 --> 39:52.705
Many things do not fly.

39:52.774 --> 39:55.540
Rocks, trees, sticks,

39:55.612 --> 39:57.308
Spike.

40:10.738 --> 40:11.706
Waah!

40:11.773 --> 40:13.537
- Hey!
- No!

40:13.610 --> 40:17.105
Ducky, push Petrie
towards the branches.

40:17.183 --> 40:18.446
Ohh!

40:20.489 --> 40:22.924
Ok, Spike, not too fast.

40:22.994 --> 40:23.926
Whoa!

40:23.995 --> 40:26.431
Ok. Hey, not too fast.

afraid of sharptooth!

42:20.466 --> 42:24.405
l hope he doesn't eat any of you.

42:24.473 --> 42:27.774
Don't worry.
There isn't any sharptooth.

46:22.091 --> 46:23.354
Aah!

46:31.674 --> 46:34.110
Now will you believe me?

46:34.178 --> 46:35.646
We're safe now.

46:35.714 --> 46:38.241
Nobody's safe with you.

46:40.156 --> 46:43.650
Look. That rock
looks like a long-neck,

46:43.728 --> 46:45.630
like my mother said.

46:45.699 --> 46:48.192
We're going the right way,

46:48.270 --> 46:51.241
the way to the Great Valley!

46:53.713 --> 46:56.650
Littlefoot had been wrong
about the sharptooth,

46:56.718 --> 46:58.654
but the others followed.

46:58.722 --> 47:02.160
Their only hope
was the Great Valley.

47:02.227 --> 47:04.754
Littlefoot alone knew the way.

47:15.785 --> 47:17.777
Come on. Get up.

47:17.855 --> 47:20.291
We're going the right way.

47:20.360 --> 47:22.421
We got to keep moving.

47:22.497 --> 47:23.931
You can't quit.

47:23.999 --> 47:26.469
What if the Great Valley

47:26.537 --> 47:29.030
is just over these rocks?

47:30.277 --> 47:33.214
Though they were
sore-stumped and tired,

47:33.282 --> 47:35.217
Littlefoot urged them on.

47:35.286 --> 47:38.257
He'd never seen
the Great Valley,

47:38.325 --> 47:42.230
but his heart told him
they were close.

47:42.298 --> 47:45.828
Surely at the top,
they'd behold it.

47:57.287 --> 47:59.723
This is your Great Valley?

47:59.792 --> 48:01.887
You're crazy.

48:01.963 --> 48:03.363
l'm leaving.

48:03.432 --> 48:07.394

following the bright circle.

48:07.472 --> 48:09.874
l'm taking the easy way.

48:09.943 --> 48:11.878
lt's the wrong way.

48:11.946 --> 48:13.414
Who says?

48:13.483 --> 48:14.917
My mother.

48:14.986 --> 48:17.387
Then she was stupid, too.

48:17.457 --> 48:18.925

48:18.993 --> 48:20.052
Never.

48:20.128 --> 48:21.562

49:17.428 --> 49:19.364

We never wanted you
with us anyway.

We have to keep going.

49:32.521 --> 49:34.218

Oh, Flathead, wait!

with scrawny arms.

that rock on his head.

[Gasping]

58:02.687 --> 58:04.121
Stop!

58:04.189 --> 58:06.716
You go without Petrie?

58:06.794 --> 58:08.057
Petrie.

58:10.534 --> 58:11.660
Oh!

58:11.735 --> 58:13.136
Petrie, you're safe!

58:13.205 --> 58:16.472
Yep, yep, yep, yep,
yep, yep!

58:19.883 --> 58:21.078
Littlefoot.

58:25.093 --> 58:26.493
Littlefoot.

58:28.465 --> 58:29.490
Mother!

58:33.574 --> 58:35.202
Littlefoot.

58:38.583 --> 58:39.778
Mother?

58:42.256 --> 58:47.219
l tried to do
what you told me,

58:47.298 --> 58:49.791
but it's just too hard.

58:51.439 --> 58:54.308
l'll never find
the Great Valley.

58:54.377 --> 58:55.868
[Wind Blows]

58:55.946 --> 58:58.212
Mother. Mother!

58:58.284 --> 59:00.310
Don't go, Mother!

59:00.387 --> 59:02.380
Don't go!

59:53.113 --> 59:55.743
The Great Valley.

59:59.391 --> 01:00:03.228
Cera, Spike,
Ducky, Petrie, over here!

01:00:06.704 --> 01:00:08.673
Littlefoot, you found it!

01:00:08.741 --> 01:00:10.904
Yep, yep, yep.

01:00:10.978 --> 01:00:14.245
We did it.
We did it together!

01:00:14.317 --> 01:00:15.809
The Great Valley

01:00:15.887 --> 01:00:19.325
was all they dreamed
it would be:

01:00:19.393 --> 01:00:23.093
A land of green,
leaves and life.

01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:27.071
There were waterfalls,
grassy meadows,

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:30.601
enough tree stars
to feast on forever

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.708
and raising upon them,
their families.

01:00:36.356 --> 01:00:39.624
This is our
new brother Spike.

01:00:47.576 --> 01:00:49.511
Mama, l a flier!

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:51.070
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:00:56.191 --> 01:00:57.420
Daddy!

01:00:57.493 --> 01:00:58.722
Cera?

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:02.296
Daddy.

01:01:11.552 --> 01:01:12.952
And Littlefoot

01:01:13.021 --> 01:01:16.460
found his grandmother
and grandfather at last.

01:01:16.527 --> 01:01:19.987
The same loving faces
he'd looked into

01:01:20.066 --> 01:01:23.061
on the day of his birth.

01:01:57.966 --> 01:02:01.132
Littlefoot! Come on.
l'll race you.

01:02:02.475 --> 01:02:06.915
And they all grew up
together in the valley.

01:02:06.982 --> 01:02:08.382
Generation upon generation,

01:02:08.451 --> 01:02:11.388
each passing on to the next

01:02:11.456 --> 01:02:14.394
the tale of
their ancestors' journey

01:02:14.462 --> 01:02:17.592
to the valley...

01:02:17.593 --> 01:02:18.652
long ago.

01:02:22.668 --> 01:02:25.605
Don't lose your way

01:02:25.673 --> 01:02:29.635
With each passing day

01:02:29.714 --> 01:02:32.617
You've come so far

01:02:32.685 --> 01:02:36.989
Don't throw it away

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:40.965
Live believing

01:02:41.034 --> 01:02:44.130
Dreams are for weaving

01:02:44.206 --> 01:02:50.980
Wonders are waiting to start

01:02:51.051 --> 01:02:55.013
Live your story

01:02:55.091 --> 01:02:58.188
Faith, hope, and glory

01:02:58.264 --> 01:03:04.765
Hold to the truth in your heart

01:03:05.911 --> 01:03:08.381

01:03:08.449 --> 01:03:11.784

01:03:15.294 --> 01:03:19.358
Will never die

01:03:19.435 --> 01:03:21.735
Dreams see us through

01:03:21.806 --> 01:03:25.745
To forever

01:03:25.813 --> 01:03:32.451
Where clouds roll by

01:03:32.524 --> 01:03:39.901
For you and l

01:03:39.971 --> 01:03:42.566
Souls in the wind

01:03:42.643 --> 01:03:46.582
Must learn how to bend

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:49.519
Seek out a star

01:03:49.588 --> 01:03:53.789
Hold on till the end

01:03:53.862 --> 01:03:55.296
Valley

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:57.163
Mountain

01:03:57.235 --> 01:04:00.104
There is a fountain

01:04:00.173 --> 01:04:06.981
Washes our tears all away

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:10.650
Worlds are swaying

01:04:10.725 --> 01:04:13.821
Someone is praying

01:04:13.897 --> 01:04:20.068
Please let us come home to stay

01:04:21.544 --> 01:04:24.344

Dreams see us through

01:04:37.105 --> 01:04:40.703
To forever

01:04:40.778 --> 01:04:47.655
Where clouds roll by

01:04:47.723 --> 01:04:54.361
For you and l

01:04:54.435 --> 01:04:58.738

01:04:58.809 --> 01:05:01.245
ln the dark

01:05:01.313 --> 01:05:07.484

01:05:08.493 --> 01:05:11.123
ln the dark

01:05:11.198 --> 01:05:15.399
We'll feel the light

Warm our hearts

As high as souls can fly

01:05:49.565 --> 01:05:53.629
