00:05.649 --> 00:08.106
She actually cried. It was real emotion.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.109
I've never seen her like that. Have you?

00:10.111 --> 00:12.144
You were inside my head.
What secrets did you see?

00:12.146 --> 00:15.147
Let's say I was trying to find
someone who did want to disappear.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.116
- Your father?
- It's messed up somewhere. You'll get him.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.618
You're obsessing and I've seen what
you're like when you're obsessed.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.153
And it's not pretty.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.855
Your apartment is completely tricked out

00:22.856 --> 00:24.556
- with smart appliances.
- Sorry, how much money do you make?

00:24.558 --> 00:25.958
What is going on with you?

00:25.960 --> 00:28.227
Climbing buildings, slugging people?

00:28.229 --> 00:30.329
How do I look?

00:30.331 --> 00:32.331
I get a second chance to live my life.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.700
I'm not going to live in fear anymore.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.202
- I'm Mitchell Blair.
- How did you get in here?

00:37.204 --> 00:39.471
- I built this place.
- Why do you want to learn how to hit stuff?

00:39.473 --> 00:41.907
You got shot. I want to
know how to protect myself.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.343
- You should be home resting.
- I'll rest when I'm dead and buried.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.944
Good to have you back, Quincy.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.355
Well, look who's here.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.924
I thought we'd almost
lost you, handsome.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.260
Nah, it was just a scratch.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.930
Seriously, how does it feel
to get plugged in the chest?

01:04.932 --> 01:07.232
Twice. Don't recommend it.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.402
So why did that guy go after you anyway?

01:10.404 --> 01:13.906
Ah,<i> LA confidential,</i> huh?

01:13.908 --> 01:15.941
Have anything to do with
that assignment you were on?

01:15.943 --> 01:18.243
What are you, CIA?

01:18.245 --> 01:21.280
Is Mulaney in yet?
I'm supposed to meet her.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.849
She's probably out
busting balls somewhere.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.218
You'd think she'd have
mellowed since her retirement.

01:26.220 --> 01:29.188
Yeah, "mellow" is not in her nature.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.289
Mmm.

01:33.194 --> 01:36.261
(Ringing)

01:46.640 --> 01:50.075
Mulaney, it's Fish. I'm up at Dano's.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.077
You said you needed to talk.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.813
You better not
be standing me up, Captain.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.770
Oh!

02:18.772 --> 02:22.474
Okay! What up, Millie?

02:22.476 --> 02:25.577
Long time no see. Ah!

02:25.579 --> 02:27.846
Kirsten, meet Theo,

02:27.848 --> 02:29.948
my brother.

Camille: Why in the hell are you here?

03:00.948 --> 03:02.514
What kind of welcome is that?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.149
Don't get too comfortable either.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.717
Do you see how she treats me?

03:05.719 --> 03:07.152
It's how she treats everyone.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.820
Theo: You should really
be thanking me, mill.

03:08.822 --> 03:12.357
The house is dark. I didn't
want to wake you guys.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.126
- So instead you just broke in?
- Hey, nothing's broken

03:14.128 --> 03:15.961
except for maybe my nuts.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.829
Where did you learn
to kick like that anyways?

03:17.831 --> 03:19.031
Will you answer my question?

03:19.033 --> 03:22.234
I... I came to catch up with my sister.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.203
Really? So how many dead
presidents is it going to take

03:24.205 --> 03:27.005
- to end this little reunion?
- Harsh!

03:27.007 --> 03:29.208
Hey, I don't need your money. I've
got some business here in la.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.542
Business?

03:30.544 --> 03:33.645
- (Phone dings)
- That is the opposite of reassuring.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.815
We're up, first thing.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.250
Up for what?

03:38.252 --> 03:40.385
We work together.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.655
Oh, a little two-for-one action, huh?

03:43.657 --> 03:45.691
(Chuckling)

03:45.693 --> 03:49.795
Come on, Mill, you can't boot me
out in the middle of the night.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.933
Um...

03:54.935 --> 03:56.435
He is your brother.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.870
See? This one's got a heart.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.372
Yeah, that's a recent development.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.440
I'm not sure I like it.

04:03.177 --> 04:05.611
You... one night.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.079
Love you.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.416
All I'm saying is the fact
that we share a gene pool

04:11.418 --> 04:13.585
doesn't entitle him
to just show up uninvited.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.554
Well, I mean, he's here now. It's...

04:15.556 --> 04:18.290
Correct, but he doesn't get to
just impose himself on my life.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.791
Who is imposing himself?

04:19.793 --> 04:21.627
Camille's brother Theo.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.029
You have a brother?
You never mentioned him before.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.530
- Never came up.
- Older, younger?

04:25.532 --> 04:28.033
Calendar years older. Maturity level?

04:28.035 --> 04:31.069
- Doesn't even chart.
- Calls her Millie.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.605
- Thank you, chatty Cathy.
- Millie?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.374
Oh, I like it.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.075
- No, no, no.
- It's cute.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.144
You will not call me Millie.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.313
Millie is the girl
I left behind in Bakersfield

04:41.315 --> 04:42.781
and I busted my ass not to be her.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.450
So you're not glad to see your brother?

04:45.452 --> 04:49.288
Oh, Linus. Sweet, sheltered,
raised-in-a-stable-home Linus.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.923
I guess a small part of me is glad,

04:51.925 --> 04:55.627
but most of me knows when Theo
shows up, trouble follows.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.063
We left him alone in our house.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.432
He wouldn't dare steal from me.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.634
- From you, maybe.
- Kirsten, you got a sec?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.536
Mm-hmm.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.473
So how goes it?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.342
Any progress on the stinger front?

05:10.344 --> 05:14.112
Oh, I feel like he is a needle
and the world is my haystack.

05:14.114 --> 05:17.482
- Yeah.
- But I did ask Linda Edwards for advice.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.819
The psycho evil hacker lady?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.521
That being said, she seemed to think

05:22.522 --> 05:24.160
that I should play on my
strengths to find him.

05:24.185 --> 05:25.601
Your strengths?

05:25.626 --> 05:29.761
Okay. Tall, blonde...

05:29.763 --> 05:31.496
Math.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.799
Hmm.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.468
Yeah, no. She may be on to something.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.204
I mean, everything is math,
so maybe there is an equation

05:39.206 --> 05:41.306
to solving the mystery
of finding your father.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.875
I just have to figure one out.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.844
Ha.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.846
So what about you?
What have you been up to?

05:47.848 --> 05:50.048
You seal the deal on your motorcycle?

05:50.050 --> 05:53.118
No, I decided to put the brakes
on the bike for now.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.154
- A sensible decision.
- But I'm always down for adventure.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.824
You know me. Very born to be wild.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.826
Ah.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.461
She was Fisher's mentor.

06:04.665 --> 06:08.300
He had to convince Maggie to bend
the rules and let us stitch.

06:08.302 --> 06:10.469
And those rules are?

06:10.471 --> 06:13.472
Hell if I know.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.475
Cameron: Mission clock set
to five minutes, please.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.143
(Beeps)

06:18.145 --> 06:20.512
Okay, team, let's win one
for the Fisher.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.180
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark

06:22.182 --> 06:25.417
in three, two, one, mark!

06:25.419 --> 06:28.387
I'm telling you,
I don't remember anything.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.355
Furillo, you lived there with him.

06:30.357 --> 06:33.525
She's talking to a cable guy
named Furillo.

06:33.527 --> 06:37.095
15 years ago! I was baked all the time.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.697
You lived with him! What was he doing?

06:38.699 --> 06:40.932
I didn't follow his every move.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.901
Wait, that's weird. There's a boy here.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.270
It seems like he's listening
to Mulaney's conversation.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.339
Furillo's son?

06:47.341 --> 06:50.776
Never mind.
I'm in a different memory now.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.245
Mulaney's apartment.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.614
She's got crime-scene photos,
notes and maps

06:55.616 --> 06:57.849
- tacked all over the wall.
- A murder board.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.352
That's how she tracked clues
in a homicide investigation.

07:00.354 --> 07:01.586
I thought she was retired.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.455
She must have been working
on something from home.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.557
We didn't see anything like
that in her apartment.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.360
(Phone buzzes)

07:08.362 --> 07:09.728
Cameron, let's keep things moving.

07:09.730 --> 07:13.498
Okay, Miss Marple, what else you got?

07:16.036 --> 07:18.437
- What does RFI mean?
- "Remove from investigation."

07:18.439 --> 07:21.373
That's cop lingo for
"remove from investigation."

07:24.077 --> 07:25.644
"Detective Daniel Powell."

07:25.646 --> 07:28.280
Powell? He was junior to Mulaney.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.148
She always thought he was incompetent.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.550
Ask Kirsten to ID the case.

07:31.552 --> 07:35.253
Kirsten, can you see
what case she's working on?

07:35.255 --> 07:37.055
The ripper case.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.458
The rip killer. Eight victims,

07:39.460 --> 07:41.626
all posed the same way,

07:41.628 --> 07:45.230
on their backs with their
hands folded on their chests.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.465
The serial killer?

07:46.467 --> 07:48.333
That psycho terrorized LA for years.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.335
- He was never caught, was he?
- No.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.737
Mulaney took lead on that case,
but she could never find him.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.308
(Gasping)

07:56.310 --> 07:58.610
(Keyboard beeping)

07:58.612 --> 08:00.812
(Computers whirring down)

08:00.814 --> 08:03.181
Mulaney was attacked from behind,

08:03.183 --> 08:04.449
knocked out with chloroform.

08:04.451 --> 08:07.085
Could it really be him? The ripper?

08:07.087 --> 08:09.654
All things point to yes.
Perp took the murder board.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.290
She must have gotten
too close to catching him.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.159
He was the one that got away.

08:15.696 --> 08:19.531
The ripper's victims ranged in age
from 22 to 48, both men and women.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.633
Highly unusual for a serial killer.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.301
An equal-opportunity murderer.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.003
They were all killed in their own homes

08:25.005 --> 08:26.705
and M.O. was always the same...

08:26.707 --> 08:29.107
Chloroform, strangulation, rip pose.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.810
- Mulaney wasn't left like that.
- I think that that was purposeful.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.544
This time,
he didn't leave his signature.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.447
Must have figured no on would
tie him to the murder.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.448
Or he didn't know
we had a secret weapon.

08:37.451 --> 08:39.618
Kirsten: He started
killing 15 years ago.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.620
Why did he stop for the last seven?

08:41.621 --> 08:45.023
Maybe he was in prison?
Or left LA for a while?

08:45.025 --> 08:47.125
Or he controlled himself somehow.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.660
Until Mulaney picked up his scent.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.929
Here.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.798
She had a lot of suspects
over the years,

08:53.800 --> 08:55.667
but the guy you saw
in the stitch, Joseph Furillo,

08:55.669 --> 08:58.470
he was the first victim's
roommate and a suspect.

08:58.472 --> 09:00.839
But she could never make him
for the murder.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.641
Kirsten: It was so long ago.
How do you remember?

09:02.643 --> 09:04.009
I remember things.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.645
So we checked out
Joseph Furillo for you.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.713
He was in prison for the sale
and possession of marijuana.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.316
- But paroled recently after serving...
- Seven years?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.585
- Six and a half.
- Close enough.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.819
Where did you see Mulaney question him?

09:14.821 --> 09:16.821
Out on the street.

09:19.593 --> 09:22.994
He worked at Pacific
Charter Cable, truck 613.

09:22.996 --> 09:26.364
Let's go for a ride. LAPD is emailing
you the archived group of files.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.600
Okay, I'll look out for 'em.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.602
(Phone beeps)

09:30.604 --> 09:32.737
Oh, still got a way with words.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.873
I should go check on my brother

09:34.875 --> 09:37.108
- before he burns the house down.
- I'll come with.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.444
I want to meet him.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.680
- Ah...
- You met my parents.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.583
Your parents were nice.
My brother is a douche.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.551
Right.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.787
Fine, I need a ride. Come on.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.064
Taco cart?

09:59.066 --> 10:03.134
Well, you didn't seem to like it
when I showed up at your lab, so...

10:04.571 --> 10:06.805
I'm sure you know why
I wanted to see you.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.207
There were extenuating
urgent circumstances.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.209
The victim was Quincy Fisher's...

10:11.211 --> 10:13.311
I don't care who the sample is
or was or wasn't.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.747
You don't get to select our cases.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.116
Then who does? You?

10:18.118 --> 10:22.787
You made me acting director. You want me
to do my job to the best of my ability,

10:22.789 --> 10:25.824
then I need to understand
the mechanics of the cases.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.459
- Fisher's friend...
- His mentor.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.627
Yes, his mentor.

10:28.629 --> 10:31.663
There is a purity to our cases
and this Mulaney thing

10:31.665 --> 10:33.231
is screwing with that.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.800
Well, we've already stitched into her.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.637
We're gonna lose Fisher
if we don't proceed

10:38.639 --> 10:40.472
with the investigation.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.744
Then it seems the decision
has been made for me.

10:47.114 --> 10:50.382
I just hope
you haven't ruined everything.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.522
Okay, what... oh.

10:57.524 --> 11:00.625
Wow, he got off his ass. I'm shocked.

11:00.627 --> 11:01.660
(Rattling)

11:01.662 --> 11:04.362
Great. What fresh hell is this?

11:05.966 --> 11:08.466
You're doing a dish?

11:08.468 --> 11:10.802
I actually did all of your dishes.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.937
You're welcome. Oh, what's up, man?

11:12.939 --> 11:14.205
- Hey.
- Theo.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.142
- Linus.
- You a friend of Millie's?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.377
Millie! (Laughing)

11:20.447 --> 11:23.381
Camille and I are friends from work.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.217
Oh, yeah? What angle are
you working these days?

11:26.219 --> 11:27.886
I don't have one.
I have a thing called a job,

11:27.888 --> 11:30.522
- which you should try sometime.
- (Laughs)

11:30.524 --> 11:32.691
And thank you so much
for cleaning up after yourself,

11:32.693 --> 11:36.728
but I think it's right around that time
for you to gather your things and...

11:36.730 --> 11:38.730
Whoa, you're going to kick me out

11:38.732 --> 11:42.033
in front of your friend?
I mean, that's just cold.

11:44.504 --> 11:47.338
- Fine.
- Cool.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.807
Hey, Linus, let's kick it, man.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.710
- I think the Clippers game is coming on.
- Yeah.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.979
He seems nice.

12:15.435 --> 12:19.671
- Joe Furillo?
- Yeah.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.475
Hey! What the hell...

12:25.912 --> 12:28.413
- Don't move!
- (Grunting)

12:28.415 --> 12:29.948
Come on!

12:30.917 --> 12:34.619
Whoa, might want
to think twice about that.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.855
What the hell were you thinking?

12:36.857 --> 12:40.258
That's the beauty of it. I wasn't.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.762
I didn't kill that cop.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.131
I didn't kill any of those people.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.866
Where were you last night around 7:15?

12:47.868 --> 12:50.034
Out for dinner.

12:50.036 --> 12:53.037
Oh, really? With knives and
forks like real human beings?

12:53.039 --> 12:55.473
Why don't you try your comedy
act on my parole officer?

12:55.475 --> 12:58.276
I ate with her last night. Sushi.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.712
So that's a no on the knives and forks.

13:00.714 --> 13:03.615
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?

13:05.152 --> 13:08.486
Hand it over. Come on.

13:10.557 --> 13:14.492
Ooh. I'll overlook this parole violation

13:14.494 --> 13:16.895
in exchange for you telling
me why Captain Mulaney

13:16.897 --> 13:18.930
paid you a visit recently.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.900
She wanted to know what I
remembered about Chad's murder.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.736
And I'll tell you
exactly what I told her.

13:24.738 --> 13:27.906
Nothing. I was a major stoner back then.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.076
More major than now.

13:32.078 --> 13:35.280
So your roommate was killed and
you don't remember anything?

13:35.282 --> 13:38.817
I found him laid out like a
corpse and I called 911.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.653
- Fisher: And that's all you remember?
- Yup.

13:41.655 --> 13:45.423
Can I go back to work now?

13:45.425 --> 13:48.092
- Go.
- Can I have my...

13:48.094 --> 13:50.762
No.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.034
- He's hiding something.
- Mm-hmm.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.836
So, what's next?

13:57.838 --> 14:02.707
♪ Now I'm not looking for trouble ♪

14:02.709 --> 14:07.178
♪ But when you look at me that way ♪

14:07.180 --> 14:10.048
There he is... Danny Powell.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.984
Fish! How you doin', man?

14:12.986 --> 14:16.688
Heard about Mulaney. Shocker.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.290
Yeah, 'cause you and she were so close.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.526
You know she had a murder
board on the ripper case

14:21.528 --> 14:24.162
- with your picture on it?
- Why'd she focus on you,

14:24.164 --> 14:25.997
even though you're RFI?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.800
Are you talking crap
about me to civilians?

14:28.802 --> 14:31.269
Ahem.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.839
NSA recruits out of high school?

14:34.841 --> 14:36.908
LAPD recruits out of Betty Ford?

14:36.910 --> 14:39.010
- Punk.
- Drunk.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.846
Where you last night?

14:41.848 --> 14:43.882
Last...

14:43.884 --> 14:46.184
You think I killed her?

14:46.186 --> 14:49.888
So I'm the ripper? That is so messed up.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.323
She came to me a few days ago

14:52.325 --> 14:54.893
asking about prescription pills
from the first Vic's apartment.

14:54.895 --> 14:55.814
Pills?

14:55.838 --> 14:57.174
Yeah. Like I'm supposed
to remember something

14:57.199 --> 14:58.997
from a crime scene
from how many years ago?

14:58.999 --> 15:00.665
Why was she still
working that case anyway?

15:00.667 --> 15:03.001
Because she was trying
to catch a killer.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.336
She was retired!
All she did was poke a bear.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.171
She wasn't murdered.
That was suicide by obsession.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.741
Now if you were still a real
cop instead of an NSA puppet,

15:09.743 --> 15:11.409
you'd know that.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.777
Whoa.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.545
Easy, gentlemen. Take a breath.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.681
Back off, Blake.
No one made you referee.

15:16.683 --> 15:20.985
Still, why don't you calm
down, go back to your corner?

15:29.763 --> 15:32.430
Whew. How are you, Quincy?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.098
I know you've had a rough time lately.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.134
We're here on the Mulaney case.

15:36.136 --> 15:39.304
Agents Clark, Goodkin,
this is Andrew Blake.

15:39.306 --> 15:42.073
He's a psychologist that
works with us as a profiler.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.809
Did you ever consult
with Captain Mulaney?

15:44.811 --> 15:47.412
Yeah, she came to me the other day.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.948
Wanted a fresh set of eyes
on the ripper case.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.983
Why?

15:53.053 --> 15:55.053
(Both laughing)

15:55.055 --> 15:57.055
- Dude! She did not?
- Yeah, bro.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.557
I'm telling you, butt-naked
through the trailer park.

15:59.559 --> 16:04.128
Wow! Millie! You were a wild one.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.497
First of all, only he is
allowed to call me that.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.499
Second, he's not allowed
to call me that.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.501
Third, it was 100 degrees that night

16:10.503 --> 16:12.136
and I only went outside

16:12.138 --> 16:14.305
because our trailer went up in flames

16:14.307 --> 16:16.140
thanks to that genius there, so...

16:16.142 --> 16:18.843
It was a grease fire. Yeah.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.144
I was... I was making bacon.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.579
Drunk at 2:00 in the morning.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.114
Beer goes good with bacon.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.582
Do you want some?

16:24.584 --> 16:27.318
- Bacon? Yeah!
- My boy!

16:33.994 --> 16:37.028
What are you doing?
Stop being so friendly.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.864
Nothing good can come of this, trust me.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.032
Just meet him halfway.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.333
(Knocking at door)

16:42.335 --> 16:45.503
I don't even... I...

16:45.505 --> 16:48.840
Hey, is Engelson here?

16:50.110 --> 16:53.211
Wh... why... Why would he be here?

16:53.213 --> 16:57.148
'Cause he said he would be.
You his sister?

16:57.150 --> 17:00.752
I mean, I don't like
to admit that publicly.

17:03.957 --> 17:06.023
Is he here or what?

17:08.461 --> 17:12.130
No, I'm sorry.
I haven't seen him tonight.

17:12.132 --> 17:15.532
Well, if he shows up,
tell him Duke wants his money.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.801
Get in line!

17:17.804 --> 17:19.804
That bastard owes me 600 bucks.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.373
I'll kick his ass if I see him.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.810
Sorry. Better luck next time.

17:33.987 --> 17:37.822
You brought your crap into my house.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.991
- Calm down.
- I can't believe for a second

17:39.993 --> 17:41.759
I believed that you might have come here

17:41.761 --> 17:43.161
to actually spend time with me...

17:43.163 --> 17:45.063
Millie, I needed a place to lay low

17:45.065 --> 17:46.731
while a guy who owes me
a few grand gets flush.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.667
As soon as he pays, I'll settle
it with those two punks.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.769
Get out.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.172
Millie.

17:54.174 --> 17:57.575
You lied to me. Big surprise.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.413
I mean it, Theo. Go!

18:07.787 --> 18:10.855
Actually, you probably are gonna
want to slip out the back.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.262
Yeah, "meet him halfway."

18:20.233 --> 18:22.700
Oh, my God, listen. If you want
a mojito, order it yourself.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.535
Yeah, I can't do that. Thank you.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.404
This is a cop bar. You're the girl.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.140
- Yes, I'm the girl.
- Whatever.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.209
You two are partners?

18:31.211 --> 18:33.744
- Uh...
- Yeah, professionally.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.446
It goes way beyond that.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.448
Look, it's my job to read people

18:37.450 --> 18:39.984
and I'm reading a lot
of unresolved tension.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.385
(Laughs) Yeah, tension?

18:41.387 --> 18:43.087
There's... There's no tension.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.755
Yeah, we get along just fine.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.324
Sometimes we even like each other.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.226
- Sometimes.
- Yeah. But you know what's funny?

18:48.228 --> 18:51.429
I actually live, like,
two blocks away from here.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.931
I never even knew
this place existed. Yeah.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.933
Dano's is a well-kept secret.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.136
Yeah, not so secret.
All the booths are taken.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.938
So Mulaney asked you
to profile the ripper?

19:00.940 --> 19:05.042
Yes, but she died before I could
give her a formal report.

19:05.044 --> 19:07.845
So what can you tell us informally?

19:07.847 --> 19:11.349
Well, from the evidence, I can
say that the killer is single,

19:11.351 --> 19:13.684
in his 50s by now, uneducated,

19:13.686 --> 19:16.320
blue-collar, antisocial, hot-tempered.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.156
The way he poses the victims

19:18.158 --> 19:20.291
in the classic peaceful corpse pose

19:20.293 --> 19:22.026
suggests he comes from a strict,

19:22.028 --> 19:25.296
perhaps fanatical religious background.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.865
So why did he stop for seven years?

19:27.867 --> 19:31.269
That is a good question.
In rare instances,

19:31.271 --> 19:33.304
a serial killer
can contain his compulsion

19:33.306 --> 19:37.942
or channel his rage in some other way.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.177
I hope I've been helpful.

19:39.179 --> 19:42.180
Yeah. Thanks for your time, doc.

19:42.182 --> 19:45.349
Oh, and I hope you two resolve things.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.352
NSA, it's a lot of responsibility.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.288
It's not healthy to be so unsettled.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.756
Hmm.

19:53.126 --> 19:55.126
Uh, did we ask for couples' therapy?

19:55.128 --> 19:56.894
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

19:56.896 --> 20:00.498
- When can we stitch again?
- Refractory period's not up till morning.

20:00.500 --> 20:04.135
Excuse me, miss, can she get a mojito?

20:04.137 --> 20:06.837
- Theo.
- What's up, man?

20:06.839 --> 20:08.973
I reached out to a couple dudes I know,

20:08.975 --> 20:10.474
but no one's gotten back to me yet.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.343
- It's cool if I crash here?
- Yeah, how did you...

20:12.345 --> 20:16.480
Millie's not the only one who
knows how to use a computer.

20:16.482 --> 20:18.349
Damn!

20:18.351 --> 20:21.852
Yo, check out that flat screen, dog!

20:21.854 --> 20:24.222
Porn must be ridiculous on this thing.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.324
Hey, man, I don't think
this is a good idea.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.527
Oh, look, man. I'm sorry you had to see

20:29.529 --> 20:31.529
what went down between me and my sister.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.664
But I mean, you know how it
is with family sometimes.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.367
You love each other, you
just drive each other crazy!

20:36.369 --> 20:39.403
Yeah, actually, I'm kind of on the
outs with my father right now.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.372
Exactly what I'm saying. And, look,

20:41.374 --> 20:44.408
if you don't want me
to stay with you, I get it.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.777
We're cool.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.246
You know what?

20:48.248 --> 20:51.282
It's all right if you stay
here for a day or two.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.917
Awesome! Okay, yeah, man!

20:52.919 --> 20:55.453
This is going to be much better
than staying with Millie anyhow.

20:55.455 --> 20:58.456
- She is such a tight-ass.
- Hey, yo.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.458
Oh, are you two...

21:02.262 --> 21:05.029
You're a real gentleman.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.598
Good for her. She deserves it.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.874
What are you doing here?

21:16.876 --> 21:19.277
You don't like it? Arrest me
for breaking and entering.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.746
I just had to hit something today.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.981
Bad day?

21:23.983 --> 21:25.983
With a capital "B" for brother.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.921
I hear yoga's good for stress relief.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.290
Screw yoga.

21:44.604 --> 21:47.505
So the theory has been that the
ripper's victims are all random.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.407
Right? Men and women,
all different ages,

21:49.409 --> 21:51.809
neighborhoods, backgrounds. But
what do they all have in common?

21:51.811 --> 21:55.446
Think about their jobs.
We had a pilot, a surgeon,

21:55.448 --> 21:57.281
first victim was a bus driver...

21:57.283 --> 22:00.518
They were all responsible
for other people's lives.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.520
Ding ding! Point goes
to the brainy blonde.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.522
Good work, except why
would he target them?

22:04.524 --> 22:06.824
That's as far as I got. I don't
have the answers for everything.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.327
I've mapped Captain Mulaney's
memories back 15 years,

22:09.329 --> 22:11.329
but they've degraded.
Can't vouch for quality.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.264
Well, still worth a shot.

22:13.266 --> 22:16.000
Hey, you got a sec?

22:16.002 --> 22:18.469
- Linus!
- He just showed up at my door.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.538
You should have locked it.
You didn't feed him, did you?

22:20.540 --> 22:21.956
We ordered in.

22:21.957 --> 22:23.373
So nobody taught you
never to feed a stray.

22:23.376 --> 22:26.844
He's your brother. I mean, he's family.

22:26.846 --> 22:30.281
He played you.
He's been playing you and me.

22:30.283 --> 22:31.549
It's what he does.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.551
We had a long talk this morning.

22:33.553 --> 22:36.620
He feels really bad about how
he left things off with you.

22:36.622 --> 22:38.356
He's trying to make things right.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.658
As soon as he leaves la, things will
be stunningly right between us.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.626
Come to dinner tonight.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.862
- No.
- Come on, I'll cook for the three of us.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.131
Maybe if you see him
in a different space,

22:47.133 --> 22:48.499
you'll view him differently.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.502
Linus, stay out of it.

22:51.504 --> 22:55.573
Just kind of hard since he's
camping out in my apartment.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.143
Just give him a chance.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.245
Cameron: Induce stitch
neurosync on my mark

23:01.247 --> 23:04.415
in three, two, one, mark.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.822
Kirsten: Mulaney's at the board again.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.692
The section around the
first victim is glowing.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.193
An emotional hotspot.

23:16.195 --> 23:19.397
Kirsten: She's comparing
the evidence log

23:19.399 --> 23:21.665
to the crime-scene photos.

23:23.403 --> 23:26.404
I think there's something
wrong with one of the photos.

23:27.507 --> 23:28.939
It's the pill bottle,

23:28.941 --> 23:31.041
but I can't tell
what the prescription is for.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.444
No record of prescription drugs
entered into evidence.

23:33.446 --> 23:36.380
Yo, starling, those pills
weren't recorded as evidence.

23:36.382 --> 23:38.416
But there is a picture of them.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.718
Can you take me back to the
time of the first crime scene?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.553
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.955
(Fast beeping)

23:44.957 --> 23:46.957
- (Flashing)
- I'm here.

23:46.959 --> 23:50.261
So you weren't home last night?

23:50.263 --> 23:53.531
- I slept in Laurel canyon.
- I need an address.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.567
No, like, I slept in Laurel canyon.

23:56.569 --> 23:59.403
I... I passed out outside somewhere.

23:59.405 --> 24:02.540
I came home and found Chad this way.

24:04.544 --> 24:08.946
Yo, Fish, you're not going
to Ralph on the Vic, are you?

24:09.916 --> 24:11.148
Oh, Fisher, you're here.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.751
You look good in a uniform.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.953
You never told me you were there.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.455
It wasn't my best moment.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.423
- (Gagging)
- (Laughing)

24:19.425 --> 24:21.425
What's the matter?
You never seen a stiff before?

24:21.427 --> 24:23.294
Knock it off, Powell. Fisher?

24:23.296 --> 24:25.429
- Yes, ma'am?
- You were first on the scene?

24:25.431 --> 24:26.564
Yes, ma'am.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.566
Was anyone here besides Mr. Furillo?

24:28.568 --> 24:30.801
- No, ma'am.
- Get out of there!

24:37.009 --> 24:39.176
I'm bouncing.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.979
(Computer whirring down)

24:41.981 --> 24:44.515
Furillo stole the pills.

24:44.517 --> 24:48.586
I told you before. I don't
remember anything about that day.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.855
What about the pills you stole
from the crime scene?

24:54.961 --> 24:57.127
I thought I knew you.

24:57.129 --> 24:58.863
You were that rookie.

24:58.865 --> 25:01.866
Mulaney realized they were missing.
It just took her a while.

25:01.868 --> 25:04.869
The statute of limitations
is up on that.

25:04.871 --> 25:07.671
True, but not for that bag of
weed you had in your pocket.

25:11.110 --> 25:14.979
All right, she asked me
about Chad's meds.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.281
- I figured, why tell her?
- Why'd you take them?

25:17.283 --> 25:18.849
I thought it was oxy.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.151
I was going to sell it for street value.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.020
It turns out it was Zoloft.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.889
Street value, crap.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.557
So your roommate was depressed?

25:26.559 --> 25:29.560
He drove the same miserable
bus route every day.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.629
Wouldn't you be?

25:31.631 --> 25:32.855
Do you remember who
prescribed those pills?

25:32.879 --> 25:34.621
Sure, Dr. Kook.

25:34.646 --> 25:37.234
- Really? That's his name?
- Dr. Kukra.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.637
Dr. Kook was a hack shrink.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.639
Show up with a referral and some cash

25:41.641 --> 25:43.807
and he'd dispense pills
like a gumball machine.

25:43.809 --> 25:46.577
Dr. Nick Kukra.

25:46.579 --> 25:49.380
Lost his medical license for
playing too fast and furious

25:49.382 --> 25:51.882
with his prescription pad, shut
down his practice two years ago.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.551
- Where is he now?
- Driving a cab in la.

25:53.553 --> 25:56.687
A psychiatrist turned cabbie. Does
he fit the profile Blake gave us?

25:56.689 --> 25:59.323
Profile's just a tool.
We're checking hard evidence.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.525
We don't know if this
Dr. Kukra is our killer

26:01.527 --> 26:03.260
or just linked to him in some way.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.062
- Can you ping the...
- GPS on his taxi?

26:05.064 --> 26:08.532
Location and permit number
arriving on your cells in three,

26:08.534 --> 26:10.367
- two... you're welcome.
- (Phones pinging)

26:10.369 --> 26:12.703
And Fisher, nothing says thank you
like another self-defense sesh.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.271
You got it. Let's go get him.

26:14.273 --> 26:16.774
And let's leave the foot chase
to Fisher this time.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.976
What? Foot chase?

26:20.546 --> 26:22.713
I just helped apprehend a witness.

26:22.715 --> 26:25.749
Yeah, your daredevil days are over.

26:25.751 --> 26:28.385
- Maggie, I was just...
- I'm already in the hot seat with Blair.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.621
I don't need you taking
any risks with this case.

26:30.623 --> 26:33.390
- You can't bench me now.
- I just did.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.125
Let them handle it.

26:35.127 --> 26:38.095
Fisher: Kirsten, let's go.

26:45.104 --> 26:48.439
Hey, cheer up, slugger.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.474
Maggie won't keep you
in the dugout forever.

26:50.476 --> 26:53.744
It's not that. It's just
this doesn't make any sense.

26:53.746 --> 26:56.113
I've been reading
how serial killers work.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.815
That's a scary thing to have
in your search history.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.618
I'll clear it later. But
they classify them by motive

27:00.620 --> 27:02.419
and organizational patterns.

27:02.421 --> 27:05.889
And the profile just
does not match the ripper's.

27:05.891 --> 27:07.725
Where are you going?

27:07.727 --> 27:10.094
I'm gonna go see a psychologist.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.429
- About time.
- Heard that, Millie.

27:12.431 --> 27:13.831
(Phone pings)

27:16.769 --> 27:19.003
Let's go get this over with.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.574
Whipped up some of my favorites.

27:23.576 --> 27:25.943
Mmm.

27:25.945 --> 27:30.914
Um, no offense, man.
This looks interesting.

27:30.916 --> 27:33.183
But maybe some Mac and cheese?

27:33.185 --> 27:34.852
How about you eat and be grateful

27:34.854 --> 27:37.087
for yet another in a series
of free meals?

27:37.089 --> 27:40.691
It's all right. Saag paneer
is an acquired taste.

27:40.693 --> 27:42.860
I think I've got some leftover pasta.

27:48.334 --> 27:52.936
Unclench, Millie. You could really
learn something from my boy here.

27:52.938 --> 27:55.539
Bro, you are so much more chill

27:55.541 --> 27:58.275
- than the dudes she used to bring around.
- Shut up, Theo.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.844
No, seriously, a parade of losers.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.212
You may have noticed

28:02.214 --> 28:04.715
that I have changed
absolutely everything

28:04.717 --> 28:06.316
since Bakersfield.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.720
Looking at your sorry ass
tells me just how much.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.655
Like you're so much better than me.

28:11.657 --> 28:14.291
She ever tell you how she ripped
off a church's collection plate?

28:14.293 --> 28:16.126
Okay, bro, come on. That's enough.

28:16.128 --> 28:20.197
Millie cons people. I mean, look, you
can take the girl out of the trailer,

28:20.199 --> 28:21.699
but you can't take the trash...

28:21.701 --> 28:24.468
What the hell is wrong with you?

28:24.470 --> 28:26.704
You're my big brother.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.138
This is how you speak about me?

28:28.140 --> 28:30.007
(Laughs) Down, girl.

28:30.009 --> 28:33.143
You are so pissed off and angsty

28:33.145 --> 28:35.713
because your life is utter crap.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.581
But that's not my fault, Theo.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.316
You took off and forgot about me.

28:39.318 --> 28:43.687
I did everything for you
when our parents left.

28:43.689 --> 28:46.824
It was your responsibility
to be taking care of me.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.693
I tried to help you
and you kept screwing up.

28:49.695 --> 28:53.564
Not like you, huh? Because
you're such a big deal now.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.402
Well, I'm sorry. I can't do this.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.237
- Camille, come on.
- Linus, I gotta go.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.539
- Come on.
- Nah, let her go, man.

29:02.541 --> 29:07.411
- She's just a stuck-up bitch.
- Don't talk about her like that.

29:07.413 --> 29:11.715
You treat your sister with respect.

29:11.717 --> 29:13.851
Wow.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.789
That's a big set of balls
for a little guy.

29:18.791 --> 29:21.925
Come on, Linus, just take me home.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.894
Yeah, you heard her, Linus.

29:23.896 --> 29:26.930
(Whipping sound) She said take her home.

29:26.932 --> 29:31.835
I want you gone by the time I get back.

29:57.730 --> 30:00.564
Well, the license plate
matches the permit.

30:00.566 --> 30:03.167
Doctor's not in.

30:03.169 --> 30:06.703
The engine's cool.
He's been here a while.

30:08.607 --> 30:11.475
The lock's missing.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.011
Get behind me.

30:19.952 --> 30:24.655
He was looking for something fast.

30:26.859 --> 30:29.593
Looks like medical records
from his practice.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.662
Yeah.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.369
- Fisher?
- Yeah?

30:51.550 --> 30:55.452
Agent Goodkin, you here for a mojito?

30:55.454 --> 30:59.289
Sorry to bother you.
You got... you got a sec?

30:59.291 --> 31:01.792
Sure, have a seat.

31:01.794 --> 31:05.796
So the profile you gave us, the
serial killer you described,

31:05.798 --> 31:09.032
it doesn't line up with
what we know of the ripper.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.969
Really? How so?

31:11.971 --> 31:13.971
Well, he chloroforms his victims first,

31:13.973 --> 31:15.873
and then he chokes them,
to kill quickly, silently,

31:15.875 --> 31:18.375
minimal use of violence. And
then he carefully poses them.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.812
Your profile would suggest
a killer whose murders

31:21.814 --> 31:25.816
are full of rage, bloody, sloppy.

31:25.818 --> 31:28.585
Interesting. I apologize.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.254
I was working from memory.

31:30.256 --> 31:33.357
If I had my laptop,
I could access my notes.

31:33.359 --> 31:36.059
I live like two blocks away from here.
Do you want to use mine?

31:36.061 --> 31:37.082
Is it that urgent?

31:37.106 --> 31:38.791
It's just that my colleagues
are out in the field

31:38.816 --> 31:41.064
and I'd like to tell them if
they're barking up the wrong tree.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.599
Okay, sounds like a plan.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.034
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.236
- Thank you.
- Sure.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.341
Forensics is on the way.

31:53.445 --> 31:57.347
The ripper must have followed
or lured Dr. Kukra here.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.416
Apparently to steal something
that would incriminate him.

31:59.418 --> 32:04.288
Did you notice his cell
anywhere in that mess?

32:04.290 --> 32:05.889
No, why?

32:05.891 --> 32:08.392
Because if he was lured here,

32:08.394 --> 32:11.028
maybe the ripper called him.

32:11.030 --> 32:15.265
His number's on the permit for his cab.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.268
(Dialing)

32:20.105 --> 32:23.941
(Ringing)

32:28.881 --> 32:31.815
- Got it.
- Check the incoming calls.

32:31.817 --> 32:33.517
I know this number.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.088
- (Ringing)
- Dano's.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.390
Hey, it's Fisher. Did you make a
phone call a couple hours ago

32:40.392 --> 32:42.759
- to a Dr. Kukra?
<i>- Is that a real name?</i>

32:42.761 --> 32:44.761
- Yes! And did you?
- Forget making calls.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.630
I barely have time to pee.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.498
Did anyone else use the phone, Kate?
Think hard.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.902
Fisher, it's crazy busy. I don't
know who else used the phone.

32:51.904 --> 32:54.271
Let me talk to him.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.474
<i>Fisher, it's Powell.</i>

32:57.476 --> 32:59.609
I saw Blake make a call from here.
Said he forgot his cell.

32:59.611 --> 33:02.112
- Is he still there?
<i>- Left here a while ago with that kid</i>

33:02.114 --> 33:04.982
who was with you yesterday...
The one with the hair.

33:08.854 --> 33:11.621
Here we are... home.

33:11.623 --> 33:14.157
Nice.

33:14.159 --> 33:16.526
You live here alone?

33:16.528 --> 33:18.095
Yeah, just me.

33:18.097 --> 33:22.032
Huh. Sounds peaceful.

33:25.871 --> 33:28.705
- This is a great space.
- Thanks.

33:28.707 --> 33:32.009
Your style is very eclectic...

33:32.011 --> 33:33.510
And expensive.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.848
Trust-fund baby?

33:37.850 --> 33:42.185
Having family money embarrasses you.

33:42.187 --> 33:45.655
No, not really. It's just
kind of, you know, private.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.557
So then I embarrassed you?

33:47.559 --> 33:50.160
Should we get started?

33:50.162 --> 33:53.163
Yes, let's.

33:53.165 --> 33:56.833
- Any progress with your lady friend?
- Huh?

33:56.835 --> 33:59.970
Might as well take advantage
of a free counseling session.

33:59.972 --> 34:03.373
Yeah, you're right. But, I don't know,
I just think now is not the best time.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.242
It's the perfect time.

34:05.244 --> 34:08.344
If you had told her how you feel,

34:08.347 --> 34:11.081
you could have found closure

34:11.083 --> 34:14.650
or opened the door
to something wonderful.

34:14.652 --> 34:17.320
You talk like it's too late.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.755
Hmm.

34:19.757 --> 34:22.659
She's left you in turmoil.

34:23.862 --> 34:28.264
I can help you feel at peace.

34:28.266 --> 34:31.234
Yeah, you know what? I should
probably loop in Fisher.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.402
- (Phone ringing)
- Oh, there he is now.

34:33.405 --> 34:37.407
He's going to have to leave a message.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.677
You're the ripper.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.213
It's an awful moniker.

34:43.215 --> 34:46.783
A gun? That's not your mo.

34:46.784 --> 34:49.018
I don't have time for civility anymore.

34:49.021 --> 34:53.924
You think what you did
to those people was civil?

34:53.926 --> 34:58.762
What I did, I did out of kindness.

34:59.932 --> 35:03.100
They were all tortured souls

35:03.102 --> 35:05.202
who came to me for help.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.804
But none of them wanted
their employers to know.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.207
Why?

35:10.209 --> 35:12.409
You know what could happen

35:12.411 --> 35:15.879
if a depressed man pilots a plane?

35:15.881 --> 35:20.584
How about a suicidal surgeon?
Would you go under her knife?

35:20.586 --> 35:22.786
So you're their therapist?

35:22.788 --> 35:24.988
I tried to counsel them.

35:24.990 --> 35:29.059
I even sent the first one,
that bus driver,

35:29.061 --> 35:32.429
to a doctor
who could prescribe medication.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.164
Dr. Kukra.

35:34.166 --> 35:38.468
Well, he won't have much to say anymore.

35:40.672 --> 35:43.940
Don't trust pills anyway.

35:43.942 --> 35:46.643
No guarantee that they'll work.

35:48.347 --> 35:53.283
You were their guarantee.

35:53.285 --> 35:56.987
I was their savior.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.656
I brought them peace.

35:59.658 --> 36:03.026
And I protected all the innocent
people that they might have harmed.

36:03.028 --> 36:05.662
You stopped for seven years.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.465
I found a different way to use my gifts.

36:08.467 --> 36:12.102
I went to work with the police.

36:12.104 --> 36:14.337
You underestimated Captain Mulaney.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.209
Everything was fine.

36:19.211 --> 36:21.545
I was fine.

36:21.547 --> 36:24.514
But she just kept digging.

36:26.351 --> 36:29.386
She made me start again.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.788
I had to find peace for her.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.558
I had to.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.127
And now I'll find it for you.

36:37.129 --> 36:40.664
It's a funny story, actually, Dr. Blake.

36:40.666 --> 36:44.067
Um, I recently died.

36:44.069 --> 36:46.369
Well, we all feel that way sometimes.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.738
No, like, I really died.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.274
And then I was revived. So...

36:54.413 --> 36:57.414
I'm not afraid to die.

36:57.416 --> 37:01.985
And whatever happens
between me and Kirsten,

37:01.987 --> 37:04.554
I will be at peace with it.

37:04.556 --> 37:08.358
The only person who's not at
peace in this room, Dr. Blake,

37:08.360 --> 37:11.027
is you.

37:11.029 --> 37:16.032
- And you'll never be.
- No, I-i am the giver of peace.

37:16.034 --> 37:18.568
To everyone but yourself.

37:18.570 --> 37:22.439
That's why when I'm done with you,

37:22.441 --> 37:24.741
I'm going to give myself the
peace that I have never known.

37:24.743 --> 37:28.345
I've seen what's
on the other side, Dr. Blake.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.413
And I promise, someone like you

37:30.415 --> 37:33.416
will never find peace there.

37:37.089 --> 37:38.588
(Both grunting)

37:40.092 --> 37:41.858
Don't move! Don't move!

37:41.860 --> 37:45.295
- Stay on the ground.
- Are you all right?

37:45.297 --> 37:48.765
- Now I am.
- You have the right to remain silent.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.134
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

37:51.136 --> 37:52.576
You have the right to an attorney...

37:53.772 --> 37:57.774
So you were kind of a badass tonight.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.576
<i>Kind of a turn-on.</i>

37:59.578 --> 38:02.445
(Laughs) Then it was worth it.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.748
<i>Seriously, thank you, Linus.</i>

38:04.750 --> 38:08.918
Theo really knows
how to push my buttons.

38:08.920 --> 38:12.322
And I clearly don't handle it very well.

38:12.324 --> 38:15.392
<i>You know I've always got your back.</i>

38:15.394 --> 38:18.461
So he's gone? Right? He left?

38:18.463 --> 38:22.499
Yep, he cleared out.

38:22.501 --> 38:26.336
- I'll see you tomorrow.
<i>- Yeah, 'Kay, bye.</i>

38:29.908 --> 38:32.842
Will you stop? I'm fine.

38:32.844 --> 38:37.580
Cameron, the way you've been acting,

38:37.582 --> 38:40.317
like charging right into things

38:40.319 --> 38:43.920
and you're so impulsive,

38:43.922 --> 38:47.991
I don't know if you're overcompensating,

38:47.993 --> 38:50.026
or trying to impress me...

38:50.028 --> 38:52.462
No, it is not about you.

38:52.464 --> 38:55.165
It's just how I want to live
my life now, that's it.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.933
Just unafraid.

39:00.272 --> 39:02.505
Kirsten, you know how I feel about you.

39:02.507 --> 39:05.375
You do.

39:05.377 --> 39:09.145
I know what you must have seen
when you were in my head.

39:09.147 --> 39:13.450
And you... you might not
feel the same way.

39:13.452 --> 39:15.552
Maybe you do. I... I hope you do.

39:15.554 --> 39:19.656
But maybe you're just not ready.

39:19.658 --> 39:22.325
And that's all right.

39:22.327 --> 39:24.794
I, um...

39:24.796 --> 39:28.565
I've just been

39:28.567 --> 39:31.301
so flooded

39:31.303 --> 39:35.705
with all of these feelings and emotions.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.974
And most people have their whole lives

39:37.976 --> 39:39.976
to learn how to deal with them,

39:39.978 --> 39:42.746
and I've only had, like, a few weeks.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.514
You know?

39:44.516 --> 39:49.018
So I don't know how I feel.

39:49.020 --> 39:53.890
I... I don't know what I feel.

39:53.892 --> 39:57.427
You know, and I'm also...
I'm trying to find my dad.

39:57.429 --> 40:00.330
You just need time. That's
what you're trying to tell me.

40:00.332 --> 40:04.434
- It's...
- Is that okay?

40:04.436 --> 40:07.537
Yeah. For now it is.

40:07.539 --> 40:10.340
Okay? And if there comes a time

40:10.342 --> 40:12.609
where you know how you feel,

40:12.611 --> 40:14.611
just... just tell me.

40:14.613 --> 40:18.581
Okay, and we'll just figure
out where we go from there.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.450
Okay?

40:26.458 --> 40:29.526
Good night.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.294
Good night.

40:39.971 --> 40:43.239
How do you feel?

40:43.241 --> 40:45.642
At peace.

40:45.644 --> 40:48.178
Okay.

40:57.422 --> 40:59.055
(Door opens, closes)

41:05.297 --> 41:07.664
Detective Fisher!

41:08.834 --> 41:11.568
Well done.

41:11.570 --> 41:14.370
It was a team effort.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.574
I wanted to help from the beginning.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.843
I even drove out to your house to ask,

41:19.845 --> 41:22.579
but I didn't know how.

41:22.581 --> 41:25.081
Mulaney always busted my chops.

41:25.083 --> 41:28.017
Thing is, she was right about me.

41:28.019 --> 41:31.521
Never too late to be the cop
she hoped you could be, man.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.495
To Mulaney.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.799
To Mulaney.

41:42.801 --> 41:45.635
All: To Mulaney!
