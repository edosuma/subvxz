WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.939
Betrayed...
by my own daughter.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.375
It's a free country.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.443
You know I forbade anyone
in this family

00:09.543 --> 00:11.512
from ever eating
at O'Shanahan's again,

00:11.612 --> 00:13.747
ever since they cut me off
in the middle of

00:13.847 --> 00:15.883
"All You Can Eat Wings"
night.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.185
It was for
your own safety.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.852
You vomited twice
and were having

00:18.952 --> 00:21.522
severe heart palpitations.
I didn't feel full!

00:21.622 --> 00:24.058
The point is, you broke
a promise to your family.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.260
Family always comes
first, Haley.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.463
(sighs) I need something
to soothe my jangled nerves.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.632
Steve, how about you put a smile
on your old man's face

00:31.732 --> 00:32.966
and do
the "Backseat Shuffle"?

00:33.067 --> 00:34.935
(vocalizing)
Aw, come on.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.304
Get yourself
out of that seat belt

00:36.404 --> 00:37.738
so you can really give
those shoulders

00:37.838 --> 00:40.040
room to shimmy.
(vocalizing)

00:40.141 --> 00:41.742
There we go.

00:41.842 --> 00:44.745
* Sh-Sh-Shake shake shimmy
a-slippin' and slidin' *

00:44.845 --> 00:46.414
* Oh, I just gotta get
my groove on *
That's it now.

00:46.514 --> 00:47.981
* When I'm in the backseat
ridin' *

00:48.082 --> 00:49.583
* I shimmy to the left
All right!

00:49.683 --> 00:51.319
* I shimmy to the right!
"Backseat Shuffle"!

00:51.419 --> 00:53.087
* I'm rockin' the upholstery
almost every single -- *

00:53.187 --> 00:55.089
(gasps)
(tires screech)

00:55.189 --> 00:57.291
(car door shuts)

00:57.391 --> 00:58.626
How?!

00:58.726 --> 01:00.894
How could we have let
this happen?!

01:00.994 --> 01:02.896
What's the big deal?
It's just some dumb old mural.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.265
Wha...
Whoa.

01:04.364 --> 01:06.267
I-I feel a little --
I feel a little woozy.

01:06.367 --> 01:09.103
This mural has been
a Langley Falls institution

01:09.203 --> 01:10.504
since 1982...

01:10.604 --> 01:12.273
I'm just gonna...
rest my head

01:12.373 --> 01:14.408
on this bit of filth here
on the concrete.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.944
...depicting a pantheon
of great Americans --

01:17.044 --> 01:21.315
Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan,
Jesus, Nolan Ryan,

01:21.415 --> 01:22.950
Schneider from
"One Day at a Time,"

01:23.050 --> 01:26.920
in celebration of loyalty,
integrity, and honesty --

01:27.020 --> 01:30.358
three virtues that can be
summed up in one simple word,

01:30.458 --> 01:32.092
"loyntegresty."

01:32.193 --> 01:34.928
A trait you clearly
don't have.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.697
That's it --
At this very moment,

01:36.797 --> 01:39.433
one thing and one thing only
matters --

01:39.533 --> 01:42.503
this mural must
be restored.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.708
* Good morning, U.S.A.

01:47.808 --> 01:51.779
* I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day *

01:51.879 --> 01:54.882
* The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face *

01:54.982 --> 01:59.153
* And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race *

02:01.021 --> 02:04.558
* Oh, boy, it's swell to say

02:04.658 --> 02:06.860
* Good --
* Good morning, U.S.A.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.895
Aah!

02:09.497 --> 02:12.533
* Good morning, U.S.A.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.035
(birds chirping)

02:15.135 --> 02:16.404
Don't you need to sign up
to speak

02:16.504 --> 02:18.038
at the Town Council meeting?
Me?

02:18.138 --> 02:21.141
No, I'm very well-known
in this community.

02:21.242 --> 02:24.011
Hey, it's that guy who pooped
his pants at O'Shanahan's!

02:24.111 --> 02:25.346
(tink!)

02:25.446 --> 02:27.147
Fellow citizens,

02:27.248 --> 02:29.917
have any of you driven down
Old Chickasaw Road recently --

02:30.017 --> 02:31.252
probably not.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.187
Ever since they shut down
that White Castle

02:33.287 --> 02:35.189
where all those Jehovah's
Witnesses got murdered,

02:35.289 --> 02:37.024
there hasn't been
much reason to.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.527
But if you had,
you would've seen...

02:39.627 --> 02:41.262
this!
(crowd gasps)

02:41.362 --> 02:44.665
Our town's most cherished
landmark sullied,

02:44.765 --> 02:46.534
violated, raped.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.736
Okay, okay, too far.
Maybe -- Maybe not raped.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.338
But definitely molested.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.740
That mural is
our greatest treasure,

02:52.840 --> 02:55.509
a clarion call
in brush and hue

02:55.609 --> 02:58.412
to aspire
to our better selves.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.948
It's where I got
my first handy J!

03:01.048 --> 03:03.617
Our love of the mural has
been reignited!

03:03.717 --> 03:05.886
(crowd chanting "Mural!")

03:05.986 --> 03:09.223
But loving the mural
is not enough.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.792
Unless it's restored,
future generations

03:11.892 --> 03:14.094
will be denied its message
of loyntegresty

03:14.194 --> 03:17.531
and go astray --
like my very own daughter.

03:17.631 --> 03:18.532
(all gasp)

03:18.632 --> 03:20.568
This is why you brought me here?

03:20.668 --> 03:22.436
Look, if we're gonna
restore the mural,

03:22.536 --> 03:24.037
maybe we could add
some diversity,

03:24.137 --> 03:27.040
like, say, replace Schneider
with Harriet Tubman?

03:27.140 --> 03:29.243
Did Harriet Tubman
sign autographs

03:29.343 --> 03:31.479
for 15 minutes
at Panini Barn?

03:31.579 --> 03:32.780
This...

03:32.880 --> 03:34.948
this is why I'm proposing
the creation

03:35.048 --> 03:36.984
of a mural-restoration
task force,

03:37.084 --> 03:39.753
a team of our city's
finest artists and craftsmen,

03:39.853 --> 03:41.989
to be led by...me,

03:42.089 --> 03:44.992
the man who crapped himself
at O'Shanahan's.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.961
(all chanting "Stan Smith!")

03:52.766 --> 03:54.635
Did you ever think
you'd have a son who'd be

03:54.735 --> 03:56.470
going to one
of the most exclusive

03:56.570 --> 04:00.274
nonsegregated clowning academies
on the Atlantic seaboard?

04:00.374 --> 04:02.576
No. No, I did not.

04:02.676 --> 04:03.844
Mwah!

04:03.944 --> 04:05.012
(inhales deeply)

04:08.148 --> 04:09.283
(imitates gunshot)

04:09.383 --> 04:11.285
(balls squeaking)

04:11.385 --> 04:13.987
The teacher here is
supposed to be the most intense

04:14.087 --> 04:16.524
and demanding instructor
in all of clowning and --

04:16.624 --> 04:19.125
Shit. It's Roger, isn't it?
It's gonna be Roger.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.862
All right, jagoffs,
the name's H.G. Rimmons.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.964
Look to your left.
Look to your right.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.366
By the end of the semester,

04:25.466 --> 04:28.001
60% of you will be dead
by your own hand.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.371
The rest will be clowns,
ya dig?

04:30.471 --> 04:32.172
Okay, I'm out of here.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.341
Huh.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.808
I'm --
I'm a little confused.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.311
Because you said here
on your application

04:37.411 --> 04:38.646
you wanted to be
a clown.

04:38.746 --> 04:39.880
More than anything.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.281
So what's your "gooch"?

04:41.382 --> 04:42.983
Gooch is "horncorn"
for clown name.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.152
Horncorn is horncorn
for clown lingo.

04:45.252 --> 04:48.155
Gonna be honkin' a lot of
horncorn around here, ya dig?

04:48.255 --> 04:49.557
So, what's your gooch,
kid?

04:49.657 --> 04:51.392
Dimples.
Dimples?

04:51.492 --> 04:53.226
Pretty "buckety" gooch,
don't ya think?

04:53.327 --> 04:54.828
More horncorn.
(chuckles) Relax.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.163
Just sliding your whistle.

04:56.263 --> 04:57.064
Why don't you show us
what you got.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.899
I...uh...

04:58.999 --> 05:00.701
Come on, man --
No pressure.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.870
Just lay a little jape
on these cats.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.538
Whatever you got.
No big.

05:04.638 --> 05:09.009
(Julius Fucik's "Entry
of the Gladiators" plays)

05:09.109 --> 05:10.911
(squeaking)

05:11.011 --> 05:12.380
(farts)

05:12.480 --> 05:14.682
Fart was a nice touch.
Smells, too.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.384
Ladies and gentlemen,
we could be looking

05:16.484 --> 05:18.919
at the next
Emmett Kelly...

05:19.019 --> 05:21.054
...of sucking!
Ohh.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.190
That's right,
you nut-lickin' little turds.

05:23.290 --> 05:24.425
I ain't here
to hold your hands.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.926
I'm here to play
mind games

05:26.026 --> 05:28.929
and emotionally abuse you
into being clowns.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.163
Ohh.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.666
That's clowning,
you shitheads!

05:32.766 --> 05:35.068
(Whistling pleasantly)

05:35.168 --> 05:36.370
Hey, Dad.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.171
Where's the rest
of the task force?

05:38.271 --> 05:40.340
We had our team-building dinner
at Benihana's.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.342
Blew the whole budget.
Had to let them go.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.244
You know, got to admit,
it's pretty cool

05:44.344 --> 05:45.946
you're doing something
for the community.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.381
(tires screech, horn honks)

05:47.481 --> 05:49.617
This town owes you
one, Stan!

05:49.717 --> 05:50.884
Yeah!

05:50.984 --> 05:53.353
(tires squeal)

05:53.454 --> 05:56.089
Well, I guess I'll let you
get to it.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.791
Good luck, Dad.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.530
All right, let's start
by getting the grime

06:02.630 --> 06:04.097
off the old cheeks.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.267
Dad, dab, dab. Oh, nope.
Smudging just a little bit.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.603
No problem. No problem.
Just need to even it out.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.304
Easy. Easy.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.240
Okay, now that's really
starting to smear.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.809
Well, I can just freehand
that jawline back into shape.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.948
Hmm. Might as well really get
in there with some 409,

06:21.048 --> 06:22.650
then, and...

06:24.585 --> 06:25.819
There goes the face.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.120
That's okay. That's okay.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.889
Got to get worse
before it gets better.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.224
Let's get the old Brillo Pad
in on the action.

06:31.324 --> 06:32.960
(scraping)
Okay.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.663
Think we're getting back
on track now.

06:35.763 --> 06:39.667
(dramatic music plays)

06:39.767 --> 06:41.502
(indistinct conversations)

06:41.602 --> 06:44.104
Dad, you look nervous.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.006
Did everything turn out okay
with the mural?

06:46.106 --> 06:47.575
What? Yeah.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.142
(High-pitched) I-I mean, yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.079
I think -- I mean, sure.
Yeah, turned out great. Why?

06:52.179 --> 06:53.080
(Extremely high-pitched)
I mean, definitely.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.348
Without any further ado,

06:55.449 --> 07:00.454
I give you
your fully-restored mural!

07:00.554 --> 07:01.922
(all gasp)

07:02.022 --> 07:04.024
(indistinct conversations)

07:11.632 --> 07:14.434
How could you have done
this, Stan?!

07:14.535 --> 07:17.971
(crowd booing)

07:18.071 --> 07:20.140
But Stan loved
that mural.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.643
It was his daughter
who had it out

07:22.743 --> 07:24.778
for Schneider.
What?!

07:24.878 --> 07:27.447
Stan did say she lacked
loyntegresty.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.183
I bet she did this --
for hippie reasons!

07:30.283 --> 07:31.485
Yeah!

07:31.585 --> 07:32.986
(crowd booing)
Dad!

07:33.086 --> 07:35.222
Stand up for me!
Tell them I didn't do it!

07:39.793 --> 07:41.228
Dad!

07:47.901 --> 07:49.670
(singsong voice)
Haley?

07:49.770 --> 07:51.371
Sugar blossom?

07:51.471 --> 07:53.641
Pumpkin dumpling?

07:53.741 --> 07:56.577
Daddy's little sugar-frosted
raspberry maple fritter?
Leave me alone!

07:56.677 --> 07:58.812
The whole town hates me
because you lied

07:58.912 --> 08:01.549
to cover up
for your own stupid mistake!

08:01.649 --> 08:03.483
(normal voice)
(sighs) That's true.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.887
And I know what it'll take
to make things right.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.589
STAN: Ice cream!

08:08.689 --> 08:09.990
(all booing)

08:10.090 --> 08:11.692
Ow!

08:11.792 --> 08:13.326
I want to fight ya!

08:13.426 --> 08:15.162
Come on! Fight me!

08:15.262 --> 08:16.864
Fight me!!

08:16.964 --> 08:18.098
I didn't do it.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.833
Dad, tell them the truth.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.202
The truth?

08:22.302 --> 08:25.338
This is the best damn ice cream
in the tri-county area!

08:25.438 --> 08:26.840
(all cheering)

08:26.940 --> 08:29.710
I can hold the hero up
all by myself!

08:29.810 --> 08:31.078
(cheering continues)

08:31.178 --> 08:33.746
(Muffled)
I'm country strong!

08:33.847 --> 08:37.517
(up-tempo circus music plays)

08:37.618 --> 08:39.251
(burps)

08:39.352 --> 08:41.054
(gasps)

08:41.154 --> 08:42.289
(fabric rips)

08:42.389 --> 08:44.558
(farts)

08:44.658 --> 08:46.226
Well, kid...

08:46.326 --> 08:48.228
you suck...
Mm.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.530
...ceded [succeeded]
beautifully...

08:50.631 --> 08:52.700
Mm?
...at being God awful...

08:52.800 --> 08:56.136
Mm.
...is the opposite
of what I think.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.806
Mm?
Psych! You stink,
and I hate you.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.041
(ball squeaks)
Now, get this through
your skull, man,

09:01.141 --> 09:02.475
'cause I don't play
mind games.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.145
You will never
be a clown.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.948
You got potential, kid,
and you can't teach that.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.116
You know what?

09:09.216 --> 09:10.718
I host a little retreat
every summer

09:10.818 --> 09:12.219
at my house on Block Island

09:12.319 --> 09:14.722
for just a handful
of my most promising students.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.123
No real structure.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.658
We just honk
a little buffoonery,

09:17.758 --> 09:19.259
lay some japes,
blow each other --

09:19.359 --> 09:20.661
you know,
clown stuff.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.295
And I think you could
make the cut.
Really?

09:22.395 --> 09:25.599
If you push yourself
to the absolute limit.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.635
(upbeat music plays, babbling)

09:27.735 --> 09:29.803
Uhp, I got to take this.
It's my "aclowntant."

09:29.903 --> 09:31.404
You know,
a clown accountant?

09:31.504 --> 09:32.973
He's got this giant
calculator

09:33.073 --> 09:34.842
that only ever adds up
to "boobs."

09:34.942 --> 09:36.176
Pretty funny, but, frankly,

09:36.276 --> 09:38.078
I think he's been stealing
from me.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.515
Now, I know
you're still upset.

09:42.616 --> 09:45.786
I can't even show my face
in this town anymore!

09:45.886 --> 09:47.187
Well, I've taken care
of that.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.922
(gasps) You confessed
to the town that

09:49.022 --> 09:50.357
you were the one
who ruined the mural?

09:50.457 --> 09:53.126
Better -- I've converted
the garage into...

09:53.226 --> 09:55.262
"Haley's Hideaway."

09:55.362 --> 09:56.697
Now you'll never have
to leave the house --

09:56.797 --> 09:57.865
or want to.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.532
Dad, this is
the single worst --

09:59.633 --> 10:00.868
When you're not
racking up high scores

10:00.968 --> 10:03.036
on your sweet "Sopranos"
pinball machine,

10:03.136 --> 10:05.505
you can groove to some hot tunes
on your top-of-the-line

10:05.605 --> 10:08.608
Sanyo boom box --
with MegaBass.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.877
You still like Warrant,
right?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.679
I don't recall ever
having --

10:11.779 --> 10:13.881
* She's my cherry pie *
Dad!

10:13.981 --> 10:15.816
* Cool drink of water,
such a sweet surprise *

10:15.916 --> 10:18.018
(distorted, slightly louder)
* Tastes so good, make... *

10:18.118 --> 10:19.820
(crying) How could you
be so selfish?!

10:19.920 --> 10:22.189
* Sweet cherry pie *

10:22.289 --> 10:25.058
Oh, yeah!
* She's my cherry pie *

10:25.158 --> 10:26.827

10:57.991 --> 10:59.259
(groans)

10:59.359 --> 11:01.494
Well, kid, you did it.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.364
You pushed yourself
to the absolute limit.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.933
So, when's the retreat?

11:06.033 --> 11:08.235
Ha! You were never
going on the retreat.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.838
I was just using you
to motivate Gumdrop.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.572
Gumdrop, you really got
my attention

11:12.672 --> 11:14.007
when you made
that banana disappear.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.508
(nose honks)

11:15.608 --> 11:18.111
Hello, is this
the North American Federation

11:18.211 --> 11:20.380
of Clowning Academics?
(nose honks)

11:20.480 --> 11:23.250
Well, I'd like
to file a report.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.686
An instructor, uh...
well, he...

11:26.787 --> 11:28.756
he hit me!

11:28.856 --> 11:31.258
(Wah-wah!)

11:32.860 --> 11:36.396
Haley, honey,
you were right.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.032
It's time I finally
did the one simple thing

11:39.132 --> 11:40.801
I should've done
from the very beginning and --

11:40.901 --> 11:43.737
Ether says what?!

11:43.837 --> 11:45.305
Don't worry,
baby girl.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.041
You'll be able
to show your face again...

11:48.141 --> 11:50.110
once you have a new face.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.926
I've seen Dr. Weitzman
do this tons of times at work.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.828
How hard can it be?
All right.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.263
Let's start by reshaping
the old eyes.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.598
Tap, tap, tap.
(squirt!)

12:11.698 --> 12:14.167
Oop, oop.
Eyeball's bulging just a bit.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.403
No problem. No problem.
Just need to even it out.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.006
Easy. Easy.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.608
Okay, that one really came out.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.076
Well, might as well really get
in there

12:23.176 --> 12:24.611
with a scalpel then and...

12:24.711 --> 12:26.579
There goes the face.

12:26.679 --> 12:27.848
That's okay. That's okay.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.850
Got to get worse
before it gets better.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.352
Let's get the old Brillo Pad
in on the action.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.587
(scraping)
Okay!

12:34.687 --> 12:36.623
Think we're getting back
on track now.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.025
(pinball machine dinging)

12:39.626 --> 12:41.761
(Hayley screams)

12:41.862 --> 12:42.996
(sour chord plays)

12:43.096 --> 12:45.866
(muffled)
You made me a monster!

12:45.966 --> 12:48.101
Oh, it --
it's not that bad.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.603
All you need is...
the right hat.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.876
Is that Eva Marie Saint standing
in my garage?!

12:55.976 --> 12:59.112
(screaming)

12:59.212 --> 13:01.281
How could you
do this to me?!

13:01.381 --> 13:03.851
I-I need to get away
from this town.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.319
I need to get away
from you!

13:06.419 --> 13:07.888
Aaaaaaaah!

13:07.988 --> 13:09.322
(tires screech)

13:09.422 --> 13:10.523
Haley!

13:10.623 --> 13:12.392
You shouldn't drive!
(tires squeal)

13:12.492 --> 13:14.494
You're acting all crazy!

13:14.594 --> 13:15.495
Aah!

13:15.595 --> 13:19.299
(horn blares)

13:19.399 --> 13:21.234
Damn it, O'Shanahan's!

13:21.334 --> 13:23.904
I just fixed her face!

13:28.541 --> 13:31.879
I'm afraid Haley is
in what we call a "super coma."
(monitor beeping)

13:31.979 --> 13:35.515
But at least she's not
in any pain, right?

13:35.615 --> 13:37.050
Oh, quite
to the contrary.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.751
The only part of her brain
that's still functioning

13:38.886 --> 13:40.353
are the pain receptors,

13:40.453 --> 13:42.655
leaving her in a perpetual state
of searing agony.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.858
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to take a doctor poop

13:44.958 --> 13:46.159
in the doctor bathroom.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.560
(monitor continues)

13:47.660 --> 13:52.866
**

13:52.966 --> 13:56.103
(sighs)

13:56.203 --> 13:58.005
Wassup?!
(gasps)

13:58.105 --> 14:02.075
You may have them fooled,
"doctor," but not me.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.443
(sighs) Fine.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.777
It's me, Haley.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.079
(dramatic chord plays)

14:06.179 --> 14:08.015
What?! I thought you were
a nurse

14:08.115 --> 14:10.050
trying to pass yourself off
as a doctor!

14:10.150 --> 14:11.418
How can this be?

14:11.518 --> 14:14.221
When I saw what my dad had
done to my face,

14:14.321 --> 14:15.688
it was the final straw.

14:15.788 --> 14:19.927
I became consumed by one goal
and one goal only --

14:20.027 --> 14:21.394
revenge.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.897
So I pretended to drive off
in hysterics

14:23.997 --> 14:26.099
and faked my accident.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.868
Then it was just a matter
of blackmailing Dr. Weitzman

14:28.969 --> 14:33.773
into actually
reconstructing my face...

14:33.873 --> 14:35.775
(ominous music plays)

14:35.875 --> 14:39.112
...and recruiting Jeff to play
the part of poor comatose Haley.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.983
Now I'll have a front-row seat
to watch my dad suffer,

14:43.083 --> 14:45.885
wracked with guilt
as I describe to him every day

14:45.986 --> 14:49.822
just how much pain
his darling daughter is in.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.658
You will keep my secret,
right, Klaus?

14:51.758 --> 14:55.795
Absolutely. I, too,
desire to see Stan suffer.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.165
You see, just last week,

14:58.265 --> 15:02.135
I asked him if he'd give me
notes on my comic-strip idea.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.138
And you know
what he said to me?

15:05.238 --> 15:07.174
Well, I have to go to work
right now,

15:07.274 --> 15:09.909
but I'd be happy
to take a look later.

15:10.010 --> 15:13.113
(ominous music plays)

15:13.213 --> 15:15.482
Happy to take a look
later?!

15:15.582 --> 15:18.251
Revenge will be ours!

15:18.351 --> 15:20.520
(both laugh manically)

15:20.620 --> 15:24.257
Wh-Where's he going?

15:24.357 --> 15:26.659
He's not feeling guilty
at all.

15:26.759 --> 15:30.097
He's back at work
on that stupid mural!

15:30.197 --> 15:33.500
KLAUS: And he's hired Langley's
most accomplished artist,

15:33.600 --> 15:36.203
the guy who paints the frescos
at Olive Garden.

15:36.303 --> 15:39.606
Looks like the grand unveiling
is this Saturday.

15:39.706 --> 15:43.676
That's the way
to make him suffer.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.313
We'll blow up the mural
at the unveiling.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.015
He'll be devastated.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.850
And revenge will, at last,
be mine!

15:50.950 --> 15:53.786
Wait, Klaus. Where did you
get those binoculars?

15:53.886 --> 15:56.823
Are those Ashlyn's binoculars,
my old American Girl doll?

15:56.923 --> 15:59.226
She can lend her stuff
to whoever she wants!

15:59.326 --> 16:00.793
(slurps)

16:00.893 --> 16:02.895
Dr. Montacristo,
what are you doing here?

16:02.996 --> 16:06.333
Oh, you might say
I have a great personal interest

16:06.433 --> 16:08.868
in the fate
of this mural.
Okay.

16:08.968 --> 16:13.906
The unveiling's sure to be
an explosive event.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.075
(slurps) Yep.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.543
Hey, hon.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.179
I brought you some chicken soup
for lunch.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.581
Oh. Dr. Montacristo.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.316
(unenthused)
Would you like some, too?

16:23.416 --> 16:27.154
Actually, Mrs. Smith,
I prefer gazpacho,

16:27.254 --> 16:32.559
a dish, like revenge,
best served cold.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.228
(laughs manically)

16:35.328 --> 16:38.731
(laughter)

16:42.935 --> 16:45.572
(laughter stops)
All right. I'm out.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.940
(horns honking in distance)

16:48.041 --> 16:50.077
(indistinct conversations)
If everyone would please
have a seat,

16:50.177 --> 16:52.079
we can begin the proceedings.

16:52.179 --> 16:56.249
(Julius Fucik's "Entry
of the Gladiators" plays)

16:56.349 --> 16:59.219
Aaaaaah!

16:59.319 --> 17:01.588
(trombone playing
discordantly)

17:01.688 --> 17:03.423
Okay.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.857
Everybody...

17:04.957 --> 17:05.958
we don't have all day.

17:06.059 --> 17:09.096
(boing!)

17:14.267 --> 17:16.569
Gentlemen!

17:16.669 --> 17:19.071
If you don't stop doing bits,
we'll never get out of here.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.874
Now, Mr. Rimmons,

17:21.973 --> 17:23.310
this isn't the first time

17:23.410 --> 17:25.278
you've been accused
of hitting a student.

17:25.377 --> 17:28.881
But it is the first time
I didn't actually do it.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.550
May I retract
that statement?

17:30.650 --> 17:33.052
You're hereby stripped of
your clown-teaching license.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.488
Looks like you won, kid.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.294
Ahem.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.166
Meeting adjourned.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.500
(boing!)

17:47.600 --> 17:49.236
(giggles)

17:49.336 --> 17:53.606
(dramatic music plays)

17:53.706 --> 17:55.242
Fellow citizens,

17:55.342 --> 17:58.445
it's time this whole mural
fiasco was made right.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.513
Okay, on my mark.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.781
Three...

18:01.881 --> 18:03.250
So, at long last...

18:03.350 --> 18:04.417
...two...

18:04.517 --> 18:06.119
...I finally give to you...

18:06.219 --> 18:07.120
...one...

18:07.220 --> 18:08.455
...my confession.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.190
(all gasp)

18:10.290 --> 18:11.624
Wait! Abort, abort!

18:11.724 --> 18:14.294
Goofus McDoof sends
his regards!

18:14.394 --> 18:15.928
Aah!

18:16.028 --> 18:19.599
Yes, it was me, not Hayley,
who ruined the mural.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.702
I was so scared of losing my
status as a hero to all of you

18:22.802 --> 18:25.305
that I betrayed my own daughter.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.341
But then I see her in that coma,
and ever since,

18:28.441 --> 18:30.877
my only hope has been
that this monumental confession

18:30.977 --> 18:33.213
might somehow reach
through to her

18:33.313 --> 18:35.382
and bring her back to me.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.184
**

18:37.284 --> 18:40.220
(crowd booing, shouting)

18:42.322 --> 18:44.557
See what your dad did,
honey?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.893
Squeeze my hand
if you can hear me.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.361
Mrs. Smith,
if you don't mind,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.397
I need to re-catheterize
your daughter's penis.

18:50.497 --> 18:51.864
Sure, sure, whatever.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.135
Oh, Daddy!

18:56.236 --> 18:57.370
Still got it.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.539
No, Dad.
It's me, Hayley.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.141
Hayley? Baby girl!
You're all right!

19:02.242 --> 19:04.644
Oh, I'm so sorry!
Can you ever forgive me?

19:04.744 --> 19:07.046
Hey, what you did
up there...

19:07.146 --> 19:09.249
showed a lot
of loyntegresty.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.251
So I don't think
people need to see

19:11.351 --> 19:13.052
a monument
to your eternal shame

19:13.152 --> 19:15.555
every time they drive down
Old Chickasaw Road.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.162
Why?

19:23.263 --> 19:26.499
Why would anyone want
to destroy my AutoZone?

19:26.599 --> 19:31.070
(sobbing)

19:31.170 --> 19:33.906
So, you think you'll end up
getting your old face back?

19:34.006 --> 19:37.109
I dunno. Probably.

19:37.210 --> 19:40.547
(birds chirping)

19:40.647 --> 19:42.114
And, remember,
ladies and gentlemen,

19:42.215 --> 19:45.452
Belljar papers are due Friday --
no exceptions.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.853
Jenna, that means you.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.288
(laughter)

19:48.388 --> 19:50.590
Hey, babe, should be home
in about 10 minutes.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.792
(gasps)

19:52.892 --> 19:55.262
You know what?
Make it 20.

19:55.362 --> 19:58.365
I got to say hi to...
an old friend.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.941
(wind gusts)

20:09.041 --> 20:10.277
(growls)
Aah!

20:10.377 --> 20:11.644
(raspy] That's right.

20:11.744 --> 20:15.248
I've returned...
as an It-style evil clown

20:15.348 --> 20:18.251
named "Gladhandz,"
thirsting for revenge.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.586
(normal voice)
That's Gladhandz with a "Z."

20:19.686 --> 20:21.288
(raspy) I'll haunt
your every dream

20:21.388 --> 20:24.424
until, finally, I lure you
into the depths of the sewer

20:24.524 --> 20:26.259
and to your doom.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.261
Uh-huh, and how are you
gonna do that, then?

20:28.361 --> 20:29.629
(normal voice) Um...

20:29.729 --> 20:32.131
Get in the sewer!
(sighs)

20:32.231 --> 20:34.901
I-I'll level with you, Steve.
I didn't think this through.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.636
I caught wind on LinkedIn

20:36.736 --> 20:38.305
of how well you were
doing out here,

20:38.405 --> 20:39.972
and I-I guess
I just kind of lost it.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.342
Next thing you know, I'm filing
my teeth down to points

20:42.442 --> 20:44.076
and climbing
into a sewer drain.

20:44.176 --> 20:45.177
I'll be straight with you,
Steve.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.446
I need your help --

20:46.546 --> 20:48.415
both financially and just,
you know,

20:48.515 --> 20:49.982
to get out of the sewer.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.018
How long ago
did he walk away?

20:52.118 --> 20:53.953
Oh, quite a while ago.

20:54.053 --> 20:57.123
Then you shall inherit
the curse of Gladhandz!

20:57.223 --> 20:59.426
(grunting)

20:59.526 --> 21:02.161
(raspy) You'll never
be free of me!

21:02.261 --> 21:04.163
Bye! Have a great time!

21:04.263 --> 21:08.000
