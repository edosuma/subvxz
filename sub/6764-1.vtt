01:57.250 --> 02:00.276
- How you holding up, Brando?
- Better than the air conditioning.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.886
Yeah, well, don't worry,

02:02.055 --> 02:05.286
the guy promised me
he'd have it fixed by Christmas.

02:06.192 --> 02:08.524
- Let's bail, bro.
- Steve,

02:08.695 --> 02:10.822
you couldn't have picked
a worse day, my friend.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.828
What are you talking about?
This is practically

02:12.999 --> 02:14.466
the best day of my entire life.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.932
What happened?
Did you lose your virginity again?

02:17.103 --> 02:18.832
No. I got in, man.

02:19.339 --> 02:20.431
To California University?

02:21.207 --> 02:23.038
They took me off the waiting list
this morning.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.602
Wait a minute, man,
I ought to knock your lights out.

02:25.778 --> 02:26.802
Why?

02:26.980 --> 02:29.107
Because all summer,
all I've been hearing from you is:

02:29.282 --> 02:31.648
"Oh, everybody's going
to college but me.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.046
Oh, I'm such a big loser.

02:33.219 --> 02:35.380
Oh, my life's going nowhere. "

02:35.555 --> 02:37.614
I don't recall saying any of that.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.623
Well, congratulations, man.

02:39.792 --> 02:43.387
Thanks, bro, but that's not even the
best thing that happened to me today.

02:44.631 --> 02:47.099
They sent you a master key
with your registration packet.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.064
I knew you were gonna say that.
No, this,

02:49.235 --> 02:51.294
this, my friend,
this is the key to the beach house

02:51.471 --> 02:54.167
where you and I are gonna be
spending the rest of the summer.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.364
Run that by me again.

02:58.411 --> 02:59.742
For the next two weeks,

02:59.913 --> 03:05.579
you and I on the beach at Malibu.

03:52.599 --> 03:55.090
Man, it's like a whole other universe
out here, look at this.

03:55.268 --> 03:58.203
You're gonna see
how the other half lives, Brandon.

03:58.371 --> 03:59.861
Slow down,
I think we're getting close.

04:00.039 --> 04:01.734
What's the address?

04:01.908 --> 04:04.206
25505 Old Malibu Road.

04:04.377 --> 04:06.004
Well, this must be the place.

04:10.116 --> 04:12.243
Are you sure
you got the right address?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.079
What, this place
isn't good enough for you?

04:14.254 --> 04:20.625
No, Steve, this is fine,
it's just this isn't 25505. That is.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.801
Let me see this.

04:36.409 --> 04:39.776
29909 Old Malibu Road.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.208
- That's a nine?
- That's a nine.

04:41.381 --> 04:43.611
When I look at that, I don't see a nine,
what do you see?

04:43.783 --> 04:45.648
I see a nine,
I see a bouncy nine, okay?

04:45.818 --> 04:48.412
- It's a bouncy five.
- Let's go.

04:52.158 --> 04:56.254
Is this a little more what you had
in mind, Mr. Walsh?

04:56.429 --> 04:58.397
I think this might do.

04:58.564 --> 05:01.089
- Whose house is this anyway?
- Guy Flemming.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.098
He's a producer/director friend
of my mother's.

05:03.269 --> 05:05.260
He's trying to get her to star
in his new sitcom.

05:05.438 --> 05:07.372
And this is his way
of sweetening the deal?

05:07.540 --> 05:09.974
Hooray for Hollywood.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.036
Check out this view.

05:13.212 --> 05:14.543
Check out that view.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.214
Celeste is gonna be jealous.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.321
Come on,
it's not like I'm married to the girl.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.323
I gotta call her.

05:32.632 --> 05:35.567
Hey, man, do you think we could have
Brenda's going away party out here?

05:35.735 --> 05:37.066
No problem, when is she leaving?

05:37.236 --> 05:38.294
Day after tomorrow.

05:38.871 --> 05:41.999
- I can't believe it. So soon?
- Tell me about it.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.575
I figure the least we can do
is throw her a killer party.

05:44.744 --> 05:47.440
Lucky for you, killer parties
are the specialty of the house.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.399
What do you think?

06:07.567 --> 06:10.365
- I think that's very clever, Celeste.
- Thanks.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.003
Brenda's gonna love it.

06:12.171 --> 06:13.798
- I hope so.
- I know so.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.463
Check out your man out there.

06:23.015 --> 06:25.575
Love is blind. What can I say?

06:28.621 --> 06:32.455
- Knock, knock.
- Well, if it isn't the camp counselors.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.185
- Well, not anymore.
- Liberation day.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.625
Was it hard saying goodbye
to all those little campers?

06:37.797 --> 06:39.594
Yeah, it really was.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.064
Well, especially because
it means summer's almost over.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.896
No, no, no. Don't say that.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.368
I have to put the ice cream
in the freezer before it melts.

06:46.539 --> 06:48.439
- Kitchen is through the living room.
- Thanks.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.269
God, Brandon, this place is great.

06:50.443 --> 06:52.502
Oh, we like to think of it as home.

06:52.678 --> 06:55.169
Hey, don't even mention that word
till I find a place to live.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.940
Silver, how you doing, brother?
Long time.

06:57.116 --> 06:58.344
- How you doing, man?
- Good.

06:58.518 --> 06:59.542
So? No luck?

06:59.719 --> 07:02.449
Well, I found one place
that might work.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.180
But I don't know.

07:04.357 --> 07:07.520
- Listen, I'm gonna go take a swim.
- Sure. Ocean's right over there.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.524
Thanks.

07:11.364 --> 07:14.333
Poor David, the apartments
around campus are so expensive.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.233
Hey, life is expensive.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.468
Hey, look who I found.

07:18.638 --> 07:21.573
- Still wearing her colors.
- I came straight from the beach club.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.538
Did Hanley give you
a little farewell bonus?

07:24.544 --> 07:27.775
- Attagirl.
- Oh, Bren, I'm gonna miss you.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.279
I'm gonna miss you too,
but it's like we talked about,

07:30.450 --> 07:33.010
it's time for all of us to move on
with our lives, right, Brandon?

07:33.519 --> 07:38.456
No, ladies, actually,
it's time for us to have a party.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.535
- Good eats, son.
- Thanks, Dad.

07:51.704 --> 07:53.695
You know, I was thinking
maybe I'd just skip college

07:53.873 --> 07:56.842
and open up my own restaurant,
what do you think?

07:57.343 --> 07:59.607
- You're kidding, right?
- That's right, Dad, I'm kidding.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.713
- Just reality checking.
- Yeah. Hey, did you win?

08:01.881 --> 08:02.973
It was a fluky game.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.639
- So you lost?
- It was windy.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.479
You know, I think the last time
that everyone was together like this

08:07.653 --> 08:09.518
was your graduation.

08:09.689 --> 08:10.883
Not everyone, Mom.

08:11.057 --> 08:14.493
Oh, yes, when are Kelly and Dylan
coming back from Europe?

08:15.061 --> 08:16.085
Two weeks.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.923
- Have you talked to them in a while?
- No.

08:18.397 --> 08:20.092
I just got a cable from Dylan
this morning.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.290
What did he say?

08:21.934 --> 08:23.765
Send money.

08:23.936 --> 08:25.301
Well, I wish Kelly would call me

08:25.471 --> 08:28.929
so I can tell her we won the freshman
lottery and got into the dorms.

08:29.108 --> 08:32.635
- So, Brandon, did you get a dorm?
- No, man, I got shut out.

08:32.812 --> 08:35.076
- Yeah, well, join the club.
- It's not gonna be that bad.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.078
I'm gonna turn the second story
of Castle Walsh

08:37.250 --> 08:39.616
into a deluxe two-bedroom suite.

08:39.784 --> 08:40.979
With a Jacuzzi, maybe.

08:41.153 --> 08:42.780
Are you trying to torture me,
Brandon?

08:42.955 --> 08:44.786
Of course I am.

08:46.926 --> 08:50.521
I don't know what your living situation
is next year, but I was thinking...

08:50.696 --> 08:52.027
- Perish the thought.
- If we had...

08:52.198 --> 08:53.563
Perish the thought.

08:53.733 --> 08:57.635
Sharing a bathroom with you
is not exactly my life's ambition.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.265
Sorry.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.804
Excuse me,
I might have to go soon,

09:06.979 --> 09:09.504
so I just wanted to give this
to you now.

09:09.682 --> 09:12.810
- You didn't have to get me anything.
- Well, I know, it's just a muffler,

09:12.985 --> 09:15.476
but since I'm staying here,
I wanted you to have it.

09:15.922 --> 09:17.253
Thanks.

09:17.423 --> 09:19.584
So do you have any regrets
about not going to Yale?

09:20.626 --> 09:22.059
Well, I did at first, but, you know,

09:22.228 --> 09:24.219
since Grandma Rose
hasn't been feeling well,

09:24.397 --> 09:26.524
I don't know, it just made sense
for me to stay in L.A.

09:26.699 --> 09:29.099
And go to California University
with everybody else.

09:30.469 --> 09:34.064
Brenda, I really admire you
for going out on your own,

09:34.240 --> 09:35.264
I think it's great.

09:35.441 --> 09:36.601
Thanks.

09:36.776 --> 09:39.768
You know, honey,
I think we'd better be heading back.

09:39.946 --> 09:41.106
Already?

09:41.280 --> 09:42.747
Well, unlike you I haven't packed yet

09:42.915 --> 09:45.679
and our flight
leaves fairly early tomorrow.

09:45.851 --> 09:47.842
Well, actually,
I was hoping that I could stay here

09:48.020 --> 09:49.317
with Brandon and Steve tonight.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.523
It's your last night in California.

09:52.692 --> 09:55.752
I know. I just didn't wanna get
into a big sentimental thing.

09:56.295 --> 09:59.287
Then how can I burst in your room
and beg you to stay if you're not there?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.729
Okay, if you want me to go home,
I will.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.668
See you tomorrow morning, honey.

10:05.838 --> 10:07.829
Thanks, Daddy.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.235
Bye.

10:09.408 --> 10:10.432
Bye-bye, sweetie.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.669
Goodbye.
Thanks for a great party, everyone.

10:12.845 --> 10:14.005
- Bye, everybody.
- Bye.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.171
Bye-bye.

10:18.084 --> 10:20.109
- Who wants a beer?
- Yeah.

10:26.092 --> 10:29.391
So your brother says they have
another hot tub on the upstairs deck.

10:30.062 --> 10:33.361
Then by all means, you should go
upstairs and deck yourself, Tony.

10:34.934 --> 10:38.563
Yeah. So I guess this means
I'm not getting a going away present?

10:39.839 --> 10:41.204
Have fun in Arizona.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.308
And don't get hurt playing football.

10:44.910 --> 10:46.844
I'll try not to.

10:49.015 --> 10:52.644
Man, do you have any idea what it's
like being crazy about someone

10:52.818 --> 10:54.581
and know you're never gonna sleep
with them?

10:58.958 --> 11:00.892
Yeah, I've got a vague idea.

11:05.264 --> 11:06.731
Hello?

11:07.566 --> 11:09.261
Hello?

11:09.435 --> 11:12.427
It's a bad connection.
I didn't hear any of that.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.539
<i>Donna, it's me, Kelly.</i>

11:14.707 --> 11:17.505
Kelly? Brenda, it's Kelly.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.542
Where are you?
When are you coming home?

11:19.712 --> 11:21.703
<i>I am home, I'm in the car.</i>

11:21.881 --> 11:23.473
You are?

11:25.117 --> 11:26.141
- Brandon.
- Hey.

11:26.318 --> 11:28.912
- Hey, this really is like a reunion.
- Glad you stuck around?

11:29.088 --> 11:30.680
Yeah, I wish
I'd brought my bathing suit.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.448
You could probably borrow one
from someone

11:32.625 --> 11:34.855
or, you know,
we could all go skinny-dipping.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.822
- Surprise!
- Hi.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.589
When you called,
the connection was so bad

11:39.765 --> 11:41.130
I thought you were still in Europe.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.461
I've been driving around
trying to find a parking place.

11:43.636 --> 11:44.660
God, this is such a scene.

11:44.837 --> 11:47.328
Isn't it a zoo?
Steve and all his drinking buddies.

11:47.506 --> 11:50.134
Welcome back.
I can't believe I'm looking at you.

11:50.309 --> 11:51.708
- I know.
- Hey, me either.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.868
Hi.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.980
- So when did you get home?
- About two hours ago.

11:56.148 --> 11:59.049
Excuse me, mademoiselle, no one
gets to crash this party without a kiss.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.083
- How are you?
- Good. Hi, Celeste.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.050
- Welcome back, Kelly.
- How was Europe?

12:03.222 --> 12:05.588
It was great. Ended up
in this picturesque little village...

12:05.758 --> 12:07.350
Oh, wait.
I can't hear you with the music.

12:07.526 --> 12:10.222
- Really. Why don't we all go outside?
- Yeah.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.130
Come on.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.501
Yes, this is much better.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.401
Yeah, you can hear yourself think.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.039
So, what were you saying?

12:21.207 --> 12:25.439
So we stumbled on this little town
about 200 miles south of Paris.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.045
And we stayed in this old castle,
had a great restaurant

12:28.214 --> 12:30.648
and a tavern where everyone in town
was hanging out.

12:30.816 --> 12:33.250
And we tried to speak French.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.013
We ate and we danced.

12:36.188 --> 12:37.450
Dylan played a lot of chess.

12:37.623 --> 12:40.217
- How is Dylan?
- He's fine. He's still in Europe.

12:40.392 --> 12:41.416
Is everything okay?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.061
Yeah, he wanted to go to Greece,

12:43.229 --> 12:45.629
and I went down to Barcelona
to meet my father.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.390
Wow. How global.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.900
I learned a lot on this trip.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.736
- Tell me I didn't hear that.
- You didn't hear that.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.637
Excuse us.

12:59.211 --> 13:01.805
- They are so cute together.
- Yeah.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.312
You guys want something to drink?

13:03.482 --> 13:05.677
Yeah, I'll have a soda,
something nonalcoholic.

13:05.851 --> 13:08.445
- Me too.
- No, thanks.

13:09.155 --> 13:11.783
- So when are you leaving?
- Tomorrow.

13:12.358 --> 13:15.327
- Tomorrow?
- Will you tell her not to go, please?

13:16.162 --> 13:18.027
I'm just glad I got back in time
to say goodbye.

13:18.197 --> 13:21.462
What, you wanted to watch me turn
into a total basket case, is that it?

13:22.368 --> 13:23.494
That's it.

13:23.669 --> 13:25.660
No such luck.
I vowed not to fall apart tonight.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.971
- Don't forget us when you're gone.
- Never.

13:29.942 --> 13:32.934
- Well, if it isn't Kelly Taylor.
- Oh, swimmers.

13:33.112 --> 13:35.342
It really is a reunion.

13:35.514 --> 13:36.606
- How you doing?
- Sorry.

13:36.782 --> 13:40.013
- What broke?
- Nothing special, just a punch bowl.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.955
I don't believe this.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.456
I'll be right there, guys,
and give you a hand.

13:47.626 --> 13:50.959
Ladies, don't go anywhere, I'm afraid
this party is gonna go all night long.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.350
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:49.521 --> 14:52.786
- Did you sleep?
- Not really.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.550
You wanna get rolling?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.422
Yeah, I don't wanna miss my plane.

14:56.595 --> 15:02.033
No problem, but first,
we have to make one final Pit stop.

15:05.104 --> 15:06.628
Are we open?

15:06.805 --> 15:08.295
Oh, I've been hoping to see you.

15:08.474 --> 15:11.034
Yeah, I told her she couldn't leave
without one final taste

15:11.210 --> 15:13.678
but I didn't tell her about the menu.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.040
What about the menu?

15:15.214 --> 15:17.614
Well, starting tonight,

15:17.783 --> 15:20.650
the Peach Pit
will feature a new selection,

15:20.819 --> 15:23.014
Laverne's Honey Pie.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.415
- Oh, Nat.
- Want a sample?

15:26.592 --> 15:29.425
Feeling a little bit sentimental there,
Bren?

15:29.595 --> 15:30.619
Me too.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.028
Look at the Wall of Fame.

15:34.199 --> 15:35.962
My shirt.

15:36.135 --> 15:39.901
Well, you didn't think I was gonna
make you work here forever, did you?

15:40.572 --> 15:44.133
Both of you, enjoy school

15:44.310 --> 15:48.041
but if you ever need a job,
you know where to come.

15:48.213 --> 15:49.339
Thanks, Nat.

15:51.684 --> 15:52.981
So before you go, Bren,

15:53.152 --> 15:55.848
you think I should put
a pool table over here,

15:56.021 --> 15:58.546
or maybe a plaque
in memory of you?

15:58.724 --> 16:00.851
Brandon, come on,
this is hard enough on me as it is.

16:01.026 --> 16:03.460
I thought you were ready to get on
with your life.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.496
I am.
I just wish you were coming with me.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.492
And endure another Minnesota winter?
I don't think so.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.731
Well, I'll be back here
for Thanksgiving,

16:13.906 --> 16:16.306
so make sure L.A.'s
having a heat wave, all right?

16:17.676 --> 16:19.940
I'm gonna miss you, Bren.

16:22.281 --> 16:24.272
Brenda, the van is here.

16:28.954 --> 16:31.149
I hate goodbyes.

16:32.224 --> 16:34.556
We'll always be here for you,
no matter what.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.024
I know.

16:36.195 --> 16:37.321
You better get going.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.225
Yeah. Tell Mom
that I'll be down in a minute.

16:39.398 --> 16:40.831
All right.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.363
- Morning, Brandon.
- Morning, Celeste.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.732
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yeah, please. Thanks.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.738
This room looks just about
as bad as I remember it.

17:25.911 --> 17:29.369
What'd you expect,
all this stuff to just go poof?

17:29.548 --> 17:32.176
No, I expected maybe you guys
would be into it by now.

17:34.586 --> 17:35.644
No such luck, man.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.713
- Come on, let's go.
- Where are we going?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.154
- To get some breakfast.
- I already had breakfast.

17:40.325 --> 17:43.954
- Have another breakfast.
- We can't leave everything like this.

17:44.129 --> 17:46.120
Why not? It's gonna be here
when we get back, right?

17:46.298 --> 17:49.392
Until then, we can go chow down,
go play some volleyball, hit the waves...

17:49.568 --> 17:53.095
- Thanks.
- I better get some sunscreen.

17:53.272 --> 17:57.140
Steve, it is possible that you are
the laziest man on the planet.

17:57.309 --> 18:01.268
You know, I prefer to consider it
a lifestyle choice, thank you.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.478
Hey, Kel, had a hard day's night?

18:04.650 --> 18:07.244
I don't even know
what time zone I'm in.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.149
- Did you take Bren to the airport?
- No, her and my mom got on a van.

18:10.322 --> 18:13.086
How weird is it gonna be
without her here?

18:13.258 --> 18:15.226
- I'm still in shock.
- Who isn't?

18:15.394 --> 18:17.055
- Good morning.
- Hey, Andrea.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.787
Andrea, join us for breakfast.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.364
No, I'll take a walk up to the lagoon
before it gets too hot.

18:21.533 --> 18:24.195
Would that happen to be the lagoon
where Gil Meyers lives?

18:26.438 --> 18:27.700
Go to breakfast, Brandon.

18:28.207 --> 18:30.072
My sentiments exactly.

18:30.242 --> 18:31.504
Let's go.

18:35.781 --> 18:39.547
- Hurry, we're going to breakfast.
- Just give me two minutes.

18:39.718 --> 18:43.176
- Kelly, what are you doing today?
- Sleeping. Unpacking.

18:43.355 --> 18:46.085
Soaking in a hot tub
for the next ten hours. Why?

18:46.925 --> 18:49.826
Well, I was kind of hoping you could
help me look for an apartment.

18:49.995 --> 18:52.623
I thought you said you found one
that was halfway decent.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.663
Well, yeah, it's not terrible.

18:54.833 --> 19:01.261
But, well, it's small and it kind of smells
and it's ugly and depressing.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.170
But it's the best one I could find.

19:04.343 --> 19:05.970
I'll tell you what.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.703
Let me get un-jet-lagged,

19:07.880 --> 19:10.610
then first thing tomorrow,
we'll find you a place to live.

19:10.782 --> 19:12.443
Thanks.

19:12.618 --> 19:15.143
- I'm glad you're back.
- Me too.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.720
Come on, I'm starving,
let's get breakfast.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.036
Read any good books lately?

19:32.204 --> 19:34.365
Zuckerman,
what are you doing here?

19:34.540 --> 19:36.064
Why aren't you back in New Haven?

19:36.241 --> 19:40.075
Well, what can I say? Once a
California girl, always a California girl.

19:40.245 --> 19:42.645
Seriously, doesn't freshman orientation
start this week?

19:43.081 --> 19:44.946
Yeah, I think it does,

19:45.117 --> 19:48.018
but I decided to stay in town
and go to California University.

19:48.587 --> 19:49.815
You did?

19:49.988 --> 19:52.149
Well, with my grandmother
being sick

19:52.324 --> 19:56.454
and the Alumni Council throwing more
and more scholarship money at me,

19:56.628 --> 19:59.426
they made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.625
I take it you don't approve.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.497
No, no, not at all.

20:07.673 --> 20:11.575
California U
is a fine academic institution.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.608
- It's not Yale.
- Gil.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.371
Hey, I'm just teasing you.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.449
So what if I spent hours slaving
over your letter of recommendation,

20:19.618 --> 20:22.109
and even bugged the Dean
of Admissions on your behalf?

20:22.287 --> 20:23.754
Don't make me feel guilty
or anything.

20:23.922 --> 20:27.949
No, obviously you had your reasons
for not venturing back to Yale,

20:28.126 --> 20:32.085
and I'm sure a high percentage
of them were probably even valid.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.935
Goodbye, Gil.

20:37.636 --> 20:39.399
Zuckerman.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.543
I'm sorry. That was unfair.

20:45.711 --> 20:48.441
You're an easy target,
that's why I like teasing you.

20:49.147 --> 20:51.638
But the fact is,

20:52.351 --> 20:55.980
you're a terrific person
and a terrific student.

20:56.154 --> 21:00.284
California U is damn lucky
to have you on their campus.

21:12.838 --> 21:17.138
The experts are saying that the climate
is changing at an alarming rate.

21:17.309 --> 21:19.368
It's called global warming.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.739
For all I know, it might be true.

21:21.913 --> 21:25.280
It is true, Mother.
It's called global warming.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.078
What's the weather
like in Beverly Hills, Brenda?

21:28.253 --> 21:29.345
It's pretty nice.

21:29.788 --> 21:33.417
It rained a lot last winter,
but usually it's not too hot or too cold.

21:33.592 --> 21:37.028
Well, they're predicting this is
gonna be the coldest winter ever here.

21:37.195 --> 21:39.663
- Great. Something to look forward to.
- Don't worry.

21:39.831 --> 21:42.959
They're always saying things like that
so everyone will buy a new overcoat.

21:43.135 --> 21:46.400
Yes, but this winter
is supposed to be particularly brutal.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.565
Cousin Brenda,
can I ask you a question?

21:50.108 --> 21:51.132
Sure.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.403
Have you ever eaten
at the Hard Rock Cafe?

21:53.578 --> 21:56.308
- A couple of times.
- Wow, what about Planet Hollywood?

21:56.481 --> 21:58.381
- Well...
- Wait, I know what I wanna ask you.

21:58.550 --> 21:59.710
What about Toontown?

21:59.885 --> 22:02.786
Lindsey, will you let Brenda
come up for air?

22:03.388 --> 22:05.822
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.357
Oh, Brenda,
I will never forget what happened

22:08.527 --> 22:11.189
the night before your mother
started at the U.

22:11.363 --> 22:13.263
She broke out in hives.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.832
Mother, that wasn't me,
that was Paula.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.060
But you were
plenty nervous too dear.

22:18.236 --> 22:20.136
I didn't break out in hives.

22:21.206 --> 22:24.664
Besides it's natural to be a little uptight
when starting a new situation.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.470
I didn't say it wasn't, dear.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.738
Fine. Let's just drop it.

22:28.914 --> 22:31.075
All I said was that both you
and your sister

22:31.249 --> 22:33.979
were a little tense
before you started college.

22:35.620 --> 22:38.180
Cousin Brenda, are you tense?

22:39.291 --> 22:40.519
Are we almost there?

22:40.692 --> 22:42.557
- Yes.
- No.

22:43.628 --> 22:45.528
Thanks, Mother.

22:56.808 --> 22:59.276
I thought Paula lived in the dorms
with you.

22:59.444 --> 23:02.572
No, Mother, I lived here.
Paula lived in Brewster House.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.874
Are you sure about that?

23:05.050 --> 23:06.415
What about Universal Studios?

23:06.585 --> 23:08.382
- Lindsey.
- I'm sorry, I'll shut up.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.248
No, you don't have to do that.

23:10.422 --> 23:12.913
Look, I just don't wanna talk
about California anymore.

23:13.091 --> 23:15.582
I mean, I'm back here now,
and I'm trying to get my bearings,

23:15.761 --> 23:19.026
but it's not very easy when all you do is
ask me questions about Beverly Hills.

23:19.197 --> 23:21.995
I promise you won't hear one peep
about Beverly Hills,

23:22.167 --> 23:23.259
until you say it's okay.

23:23.435 --> 23:24.459
Okay.

23:24.636 --> 23:26.536
Brenda.

23:26.705 --> 23:29.868
Darla. Hey, how are you?

23:30.041 --> 23:32.032
- You look great.
- Thanks, so do you.

23:32.210 --> 23:33.643
- When did you get here?
- Yesterday.

23:33.812 --> 23:35.803
Don't worry,
I didn't touch your half of the room.

23:35.981 --> 23:38.279
This is my cousin Lindsey.
This is Darla Hansen.

23:38.450 --> 23:40.850
One of my friends from junior high.
We're gonna be roommates.

23:41.019 --> 23:42.680
Hey, you know who else
is on our floor?

23:42.854 --> 23:44.879
- Katie Destable and Jan Myler.
- Great.

23:45.056 --> 23:48.719
And Jan wanted me to make sure
I ask you a very specific question.

23:48.894 --> 23:51.761
- Sure.
- What's Tom Cruise really like?

23:51.930 --> 23:55.229
Does this mean it's okay
to talk about Beverly Hills again?

23:59.037 --> 24:01.062
Steve, lighten up, man.

24:01.239 --> 24:04.003
So that guy blocked your best spike,
it's no big deal.

24:04.176 --> 24:07.111
- He was, you know, about this tall.
- What you trying to do, rub it in?

24:07.279 --> 24:09.543
I'm just kidding man, come on.

24:09.714 --> 24:12.842
- I just hate losing to inferior players.
- You just hate losing, period.

24:13.018 --> 24:14.815
I think you need to seek
psychiatric help.

24:14.986 --> 24:16.544
- Whose side are you on?
- Yours.

24:16.721 --> 24:17.745
And don't forget it.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.823
Don't forget to help me
clean up this mess, okay?

24:19.991 --> 24:21.185
- We won't be long.
- All right.

24:21.359 --> 24:23.293
Feel free to start without us
if you get the urge.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.192
Yeah, I got your urge
right over here, brother.

24:51.690 --> 24:52.714
Hold it right there.

24:52.891 --> 24:54.415
Hey, hey,
what the hell are you doing?

24:54.593 --> 24:56.720
- Just shut up and put that down.
- Is that Mace?

24:56.895 --> 24:58.954
- What are you...?
- I said don't move, and I mean it!

24:59.130 --> 25:01.257
- Sorry, put the Mace down.
- Don't tell me what to do.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.298
I give up, okay? I give up.

25:03.468 --> 25:05.299
Put the Mace down,
let's talk about this,

25:05.470 --> 25:07.028
this is some kind of
misunderstanding.

25:07.205 --> 25:10.140
Why don't you just
put the Mace down, okay?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.043
This is like celebrity row out here.

25:22.220 --> 25:25.951
In five minutes, I've seen Bruce Willis,
Rob Reiner, and Diana Ross.

25:26.124 --> 25:27.148
This is Malibu,

25:27.325 --> 25:30.123
they don't let you on this beach
without a SAG card.

25:30.428 --> 25:32.828
- You're funny.
- Come here.

25:34.499 --> 25:37.127
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?

25:37.302 --> 25:40.499
- Is he okay?
- He's just goofing around.

25:40.672 --> 25:42.401
Look, why don't you put down
the Mace?

25:42.574 --> 25:44.405
I'm not gonna hurt you.

25:44.576 --> 25:46.339
Who's that?

25:48.013 --> 25:49.844
- Get back, get back!
- Why don't you relax?

25:50.015 --> 25:51.880
- Brandon!
- Steve!

25:52.050 --> 25:53.415
- Stevie?
- Jill.

25:53.585 --> 25:54.677
What are you doing here?

25:54.853 --> 25:57.413
- I just flew in on the redeye.
- You know this person?

25:57.589 --> 25:59.784
It's Jill Flemming.
It's Guy Flemming's daughter.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.384
- Jill, how are you?
- A little shaky.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.722
You're a little psychopath.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.330
- What is the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?

26:07.499 --> 26:08.625
I come in here to get a soda,

26:08.800 --> 26:11.462
next thing I know
I'm involved in chemical warfare.

26:11.636 --> 26:14.298
- I guess I overreacted a little bit.
- A little bit?

26:14.472 --> 26:16.064
You always walk around
with a can of Mace?

26:16.241 --> 26:17.936
Wait, are you related
to Emily Valentine?

26:18.109 --> 26:19.167
Well, excuse me,

26:19.344 --> 26:22.142
but I walk into my father's house
expecting to find my father,

26:22.314 --> 26:25.477
and instead I find the door open,
the house completely trashed,

26:25.650 --> 26:28.619
and some strange guy
walking around with a toaster oven.

26:28.787 --> 26:31.984
So I jump to the conclusion
that we're being ripped off.

26:33.658 --> 26:36.957
- Silly me.
- It's pretty funny if you think about it.

26:38.296 --> 26:42.790
- You tried to poke my eyeballs out.
- I'm sorry, I really am.

26:42.968 --> 26:44.902
I'm a New Yorker. I get paranoid.

26:47.405 --> 26:48.599
Jill Flemming.

26:50.642 --> 26:52.007
Brandon Walsh.

26:52.177 --> 26:55.305
Brandon and I are housesitting
for the next two weeks.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.675
I guess your father
didn't tell you about that, huh?

26:57.849 --> 27:01.012
Oh, I wanted to surprise him.
What, he's not in town?

27:01.186 --> 27:03.017
My mother said
he was in North Carolina.

27:03.188 --> 27:05.622
Oh, right. The Andy Griffith thing.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.782
He's directing Matlock meets Aunt Bee
or something like that.

27:08.960 --> 27:13.522
Look, once you get to know me,
I'm really not a lunatic.

27:14.933 --> 27:16.924
I'll take your word for that.

27:19.037 --> 27:24.703
So tell me,
what's it like living in an actual pigsty?

27:26.311 --> 27:30.372
Well, Brandon and I had a major
goodbye party for his sister last night.

27:30.548 --> 27:32.243
- Was that last night?
- Yeah.

27:32.417 --> 27:35.511
We'll get everything back the way it
was, and be out by the end of the day.

27:35.687 --> 27:37.621
Oh, no, no,
you don't have to leave on my account.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.654
The more the merrier, right?

27:45.497 --> 27:48.159
Celeste, this is Jill. Jill, Celeste.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.427
- Oh, hi, Celeste.
- Hi.

27:55.807 --> 27:58.503
Gosh, I just hope
none of my classes start before 10:00.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.736
Oh, like freshmen have any say
in the matter.

28:00.912 --> 28:03.779
Well, if I can get this schedule,
I will have Thursdays off.

28:03.948 --> 28:05.074
What are you taking, Bren?

28:05.250 --> 28:08.515
Introduction to Dramatic Literature,
The History of Broadcasting,

28:08.687 --> 28:10.985
and an acting workshop.

28:12.957 --> 28:14.288
What?

28:14.459 --> 28:16.927
People usually go out to California
to take acting workshops,

28:17.095 --> 28:18.187
not the other way around.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.958
- I guess I'm starting a new trend.
- Brenda's always been very trendy.

28:22.434 --> 28:23.628
So I gotta ask,

28:23.802 --> 28:26.600
do you know any movie stars
or kids of movie stars?

28:27.338 --> 28:28.828
Just Samantha Sanders' son.

28:29.007 --> 28:30.668
Gosh,
I bet he's pretty screwed up, huh?

28:31.242 --> 28:32.766
No, actually,
Steve's a really good guy.

28:32.944 --> 28:36.141
- He's not a snob?
- He's my brother's best friend.

28:36.314 --> 28:39.511
- Is he spoiled?
- No more than anyone else.

28:39.684 --> 28:41.879
Anyone from Beverly Hills, that is.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.987
So, what kind of car does he drive?

28:45.523 --> 28:49.857
He drives a Corvette.
And my ex-boyfriend drives a Porsche.

28:50.028 --> 28:52.496
And most of my other friends
drive BMW convertibles.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.097
They shop on Rodeo Drive.

28:54.265 --> 28:56.927
And they're all incredibly shallow,
phony and brain-dead.

28:58.002 --> 29:00.129
Are there any other stupid questions
that I can answer?

29:00.305 --> 29:01.499
- Brenda.
- Look, I'm sorry.

29:01.673 --> 29:04.767
But you guys are making me feel
incredibly self-conscious.

29:04.943 --> 29:08.379
It's not like I'm Brenda Walsh,
I'm Brenda Beverly Hills.

29:09.881 --> 29:13.078
You're right. I'm sorry.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.082
But you know,
it's just the name Beverly Hills,

29:15.253 --> 29:17.687
that conjures up all these images
and stereotypes.

29:19.324 --> 29:22.782
If someone doesn't like me because
I'm from Beverly Hills, that's their loss.

29:22.961 --> 29:24.121
Absolutely.

29:24.295 --> 29:27.264
And if someone only likes me
because I went to West Beverly High,

29:27.999 --> 29:30.433
well, that's not gonna work either.

29:31.102 --> 29:32.160
The truth of the matter is,

29:32.337 --> 29:35.238
L.A. Isn't that much different
from the rest of the country.

29:35.406 --> 29:36.634
It really isn't.

29:42.747 --> 29:44.044
I don't know why we're down here.

29:44.215 --> 29:46.445
You know the beach
is way out of my price range.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.212
Then where do you wanna live,
David? Melrose Place?

29:49.387 --> 29:51.981
- What's wrong with Melrose Place?
- It's not the beach.

29:52.157 --> 29:54.853
I can't afford to live at the beach.

29:55.026 --> 29:57.119
I thought you asked me
to help you find an apartment

29:57.295 --> 29:58.660
because you valued my opinion,
but...

29:58.830 --> 30:01.697
Okay, okay, fine, while we're
down here, we'll see what's what.

30:01.866 --> 30:03.834
Well, don't worry,
we'll find something.

30:04.002 --> 30:05.560
You guys want some juice
or something?

30:05.737 --> 30:07.534
No, thank you.

30:10.508 --> 30:13.068
It's like he is regressing
right in front of my eyes.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.576
I wish they had room for him
in the dorms.

30:15.747 --> 30:18.341
Tell you what, he can have my spot
and I'll move to the beach.

30:18.516 --> 30:21.576
- Kel!
- It has nothing to do with you.

30:22.220 --> 30:26.213
It's just the thought of living on campus
is so institutional.

30:26.891 --> 30:28.654
Well, you could move in with Dylan.

30:29.394 --> 30:30.884
I seriously doubt that.

30:31.429 --> 30:34.091
Oh, come on,
I bet you could convince him.

30:34.265 --> 30:37.359
Maybe,
if we were still on speaking terms.

30:37.535 --> 30:39.730
- What?
- You heard me.

30:41.773 --> 30:45.732
Europe wasn't exactly as picturesque
as I made it seem.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.035
What happened?

30:48.313 --> 30:50.440
<i>Everything was actually très joli</i>

30:50.615 --> 30:53.311
until Dylan found out
he didn't get into Berkeley.

30:53.484 --> 30:54.508
He didn't?

30:54.686 --> 30:57.018
They didn't even put him
on the waiting list.

30:57.188 --> 31:00.214
And at that point we had been
at that old castle for about two weeks,

31:00.391 --> 31:03.724
and frankly, I was starting to get
a little claustrophobic

31:03.895 --> 31:05.590
being in the same place
with the same people

31:05.763 --> 31:08.561
who hardly spoke to me,
and who hardly showered.

31:09.767 --> 31:13.168
And when I said something to Dylan,
he just checked out on me.

31:13.905 --> 31:16.135
Wait, you mean he left
without even saying goodbye?

31:17.308 --> 31:20.141
Donna, you have to promise
not to tell anybody what I'm telling you.

31:20.311 --> 31:21.744
I cross my heart, hope to die.

31:24.849 --> 31:26.009
We broke up.

31:27.852 --> 31:28.876
Kel...

31:30.154 --> 31:33.055
Anybody who says
being in a good relationship is easy

31:33.224 --> 31:36.352
has never been
in a good relationship.

31:48.373 --> 31:51.206
How can you call
these things bagels?

31:52.577 --> 31:53.908
What's the matter? Isn't it fresh?

31:54.078 --> 31:58.208
No, it's fresh.
It's just not a New York bagel.

31:58.383 --> 32:01.409
- What's a New York bagel like?
- It's rude and obnoxious.

32:02.687 --> 32:04.848
Score one for the boy
from Beverly Hills.

32:05.023 --> 32:07.389
Oh, yeah, he wishes he could score,
don't you, Stevie?

32:07.558 --> 32:10.254
Well, I must admit I've always had
a soft spot in my heart for Jill

32:10.428 --> 32:12.123
ever since she taught me
how to French kiss

32:12.297 --> 32:13.889
when we were mere young'uns.

32:14.565 --> 32:17.466
- Robbing the cradle, huh?
- He told me he was 14.

32:17.635 --> 32:18.795
Anything for a cheap thrill.

32:21.072 --> 32:23.267
Cel, you want some more OJ?

32:23.441 --> 32:26.137
No, actually,
I think I'll go get another bagel.

32:26.311 --> 32:28.677
I think they're delicious.

32:31.883 --> 32:33.510
Excuse me.

32:39.557 --> 32:42.788
Oh, come on,
we were just reminiscing.

32:44.162 --> 32:45.459
Don't tell me you feel threatened

32:45.630 --> 32:47.393
because I made out with Jill
when I was a kid?

32:47.565 --> 32:49.795
- No, Steve.
- Then what's bothering you?

32:49.968 --> 32:52.266
What's bothering me is
you've been so busy fawning over her

32:52.437 --> 32:54.098
you haven't said
a word to me all morning.

32:54.272 --> 32:55.671
- Celeste, I haven't...
- No!

32:55.840 --> 32:58.035
And if you ever wanna be
with me again,

32:58.209 --> 33:00.871
you better just remember
where your bagel is buttered, buddy.

33:13.324 --> 33:17.658
Kitchen floor's completely tiled,
all the carpets are new.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.161
And all of the rooms
have been freshly painted,

33:20.331 --> 33:24.427
there's plenty of parking in the rear
and the view is worth a million bucks.

33:25.036 --> 33:26.867
Yeah, that's probably
how much the rent is.

33:27.038 --> 33:30.269
- It's worth it.
- But it's a two-bedroom apartment.

33:30.475 --> 33:31.635
Listen, thanks for your time,

33:31.809 --> 33:33.242
but I was looking for
a one bedroom...

33:33.411 --> 33:34.844
We'll take it.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.311
What are you talking about?
I can't afford to live here.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.109
Even if I could,
I don't have a roommate.

33:39.283 --> 33:40.750
You do now.

33:40.918 --> 33:42.715
- Kelly.
- Donna.

33:42.887 --> 33:44.878
No, you can't leave me stranded
at the dorms.

33:45.056 --> 33:46.887
I'll never make it
through a year by myself.

33:48.159 --> 33:50.491
Wait a minute,
if you like this apartment,

33:50.661 --> 33:51.889
you'll love the one upstairs.

33:52.063 --> 33:55.430
Everything is exactly the same
except it's got three bedrooms,

33:55.600 --> 33:57.693
and the view is worth
2 million bucks.

33:58.669 --> 34:02.105
- What do you say?
- Oh, this is crazy.

34:02.273 --> 34:03.740
Oh, let's do it.

34:03.908 --> 34:06.001
Guys, guys.
How can we afford to live here?

34:06.177 --> 34:07.542
We'll figure something out.

34:07.712 --> 34:11.478
I'll need the first and last month's rent,
and a security deposit.

34:12.016 --> 34:13.949
Yeah, sure, no problem.

34:14.118 --> 34:16.449
We'll get it to you as soon
as they explain to their mothers

34:16.621 --> 34:18.452
why they won't be living
in the dorm.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.023
I'm sure Donna's mom
will be real understanding.

34:34.871 --> 34:39.366
With Celeste, all I do is go boo
and she's on me like white on rice.

34:39.710 --> 34:42.440
- Feeling the yoke, my brother?
- I had no idea she was so possessive.

34:42.612 --> 34:44.478
- She went way over the top.
- Steve, Steve.

34:44.649 --> 34:46.947
You were laying it on pretty thick
with Jill.

34:47.118 --> 34:48.346
- It's a different story.
- No.

34:48.518 --> 34:50.350
You flirt with chicks
every chance you get.

34:51.621 --> 34:54.591
All right, that may be true, but I've
wanted Jill Flemming my entire life.

34:54.759 --> 34:57.455
The fact of the matter is
since before puberty.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.196
How old is Jill anyway?

35:00.832 --> 35:02.561
Two years older than us,
but I'm telling you,

35:02.733 --> 35:04.928
the way she's dropping hints,
I don't think age is a...

35:05.103 --> 35:06.536
Are you and I
watching the same play?

35:06.704 --> 35:08.001
I haven't seen her drop anything.

35:08.172 --> 35:11.369
I can see why you're attracted to her
even if she's a paranoid New Yorker.

35:11.542 --> 35:12.566
I love that.

35:12.743 --> 35:14.574
You wanna jeopardize
what you have with Celeste

35:14.745 --> 35:17.509
for some girl who's only gonna be here
for two weeks?

35:18.182 --> 35:19.843
Yeah, you're right.

35:24.255 --> 35:27.520
Hey, Andrea! Zuckerman!

35:30.962 --> 35:34.591
Looks like she's in an awful big hurry
to get back to the lagoon.

35:34.765 --> 35:36.790
Yeah, man.

35:45.343 --> 35:46.810
Gil.

35:47.512 --> 35:50.743
Zuckerman, twice in two days.

35:50.915 --> 35:52.007
People might start talking.

35:53.317 --> 35:54.909
Well, they can talk
as much as they want.

35:55.086 --> 35:58.419
I don't think that you and I are
gonna have a lot to say to each other

35:58.589 --> 36:00.853
by the time I'm finished.

36:02.793 --> 36:04.226
What's wrong?

36:07.565 --> 36:08.623
My not going to Yale

36:08.799 --> 36:12.200
was one of the toughest decisions
that I've ever had to make

36:13.104 --> 36:16.267
and I don't appreciate
that you treat it like some kind of joke.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.600
Andrea...

36:17.775 --> 36:20.676
And I don't care if you think that
I wimped out because I'm staying here.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.040
This is my life,
I don't have to justify myself to you,

36:23.214 --> 36:24.238
or to anybody else.

36:24.415 --> 36:26.542
So what if I don't go
to the Godalmighty Ivy League?

36:26.751 --> 36:29.219
I mean, really, who cares?

36:32.690 --> 36:34.783
What am I doing?

36:34.959 --> 36:38.759
It's okay, it's okay.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.791
Come here, sit down.

36:41.966 --> 36:44.059
Oh, Gil.

36:44.869 --> 36:48.361
Oh, I feel like I've missed the train
and it's never coming back for me.

36:48.539 --> 36:52.873
It's like I said the other day,
California University is a great school,

36:53.044 --> 36:55.444
and if you don't like it,
you can always transfer.

36:56.013 --> 36:58.311
Or here's a revolutionary idea,

36:58.482 --> 37:01.246
you can take some time off
to find yourself.

37:01.419 --> 37:06.482
But whatever you do, just remember,
no one's keeping score but you, okay?

37:09.126 --> 37:10.559
I'm so embarrassed.

37:11.195 --> 37:12.492
So you bit my head off.

37:12.663 --> 37:15.223
What's a little venting
between friends?

37:15.533 --> 37:19.094
- You wanna stay for lunch?
- Well, I don't wanna put you out.

37:19.270 --> 37:22.239
We're just having tuna salad.
I'll tell Maggie to set another place.

37:22.406 --> 37:23.771
Who's Maggie? Your chef?

37:23.941 --> 37:25.101
My fiancé.

37:25.276 --> 37:27.437
- You never met her?
- No.

37:28.813 --> 37:31.008
Come on in. I'll introduce you.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.149
Great.

37:39.357 --> 37:44.226
So, Brenda,
anything starting to look familiar?

37:44.762 --> 37:46.787
Everything looks exactly the same.

37:46.964 --> 37:49.524
That's because nothing ever changes
around here.

37:49.700 --> 37:53.568
There it is. 6131 Barrows Drive.

38:06.617 --> 38:08.915
It used to seem so much bigger.

38:09.086 --> 38:11.247
Well, that's because
you used to be so much smaller.

38:11.422 --> 38:13.322
When I look at that lawn,
all I can see

38:13.491 --> 38:15.959
are two little 4-year-old twins
dressed like Indians.

38:16.861 --> 38:20.422
- I remember that.
- So do I.

38:25.670 --> 38:27.865
Well, doesn't look like
anybody's home.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.904
Maybe it's just as well.

38:30.074 --> 38:32.099
I really wanted to see
what they did to my old room.

38:32.276 --> 38:35.712
Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time
to come back during the school year.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.347
Yeah.

38:43.220 --> 38:46.519
Did you and Cousin Brandon
used to climb this tree?

38:46.691 --> 38:48.955
We used to swing from an old tire

38:49.126 --> 38:51.151
that my dad hung up
on one of the branches.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.092
We would wait
for the ice cream truck to come.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.289
And I would always get
a cherry Popsicle,

38:55.466 --> 38:57.263
and Brandon would always get
a Drumstick.

38:57.435 --> 39:00.632
So it was just as boring
growing up then as it is now, huh?

39:00.805 --> 39:03.831
- No, I loved growing up here.
- Do you love being back here now?

39:04.008 --> 39:06.943
What I don't love is being bit
by these killer mosquitoes.

39:07.111 --> 39:08.578
Welcome back to Minnesota.

39:08.746 --> 39:11.214
They say that this has been
the worst year for mosquitoes ever,

39:11.382 --> 39:14.283
and frankly,
I don't ever remember it being this bad.

39:14.452 --> 39:17.046
- Mom, can I talk to you for a second?
- Why, sure.

39:17.221 --> 39:20.657
- I don't know about this.
- About what?

39:20.825 --> 39:22.918
What if I made a terrible mistake
coming back here?

39:23.861 --> 39:27.661
- What if things don't work?
- Honey, don't let it upset you.

39:27.832 --> 39:29.493
The first days
are always the hardest.

39:29.667 --> 39:32.192
You'll feel much better
once classes start, you'll see.

39:33.738 --> 39:35.035
I hope so.

39:53.791 --> 39:56.055
Must have the wrong number.

39:56.794 --> 40:01.060
Steven, don't be a wuss.
Just give me a sec, will you?

40:07.671 --> 40:09.662
Oh, man.

40:11.275 --> 40:13.539
Olly olly oxen free.

40:13.711 --> 40:16.009
Going for that full-bodied tan?

40:16.180 --> 40:18.546
No, just trying to unwind a little.

40:18.716 --> 40:20.809
Trying to get a handle
on all my urban angst.

40:20.985 --> 40:22.976
Well, you definitely have
a nice set of handles.

40:23.154 --> 40:25.145
- Not that I was peeking or anything.
- Sure, Steve.

40:25.322 --> 40:27.950
No, listen, before we go any further,
I have to confess something.

40:28.125 --> 40:30.719
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
before you get all pious on me,

40:30.895 --> 40:33.090
what can you tell me
about your friend?

40:35.966 --> 40:39.094
- You wanna know about Brandon?
- No, I wanna know about Murgatroyd.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.567
Yes, of course, Brandon.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.172
You wanna know
if he's seeing anybody?

40:43.908 --> 40:45.705
I don't know, Stevie.
You must be psychic.

40:47.211 --> 40:51.739
- I think you two will make a perfect fit.
- We'll see.

40:54.819 --> 40:57.185
Okay, here goes nothing.

41:08.065 --> 41:10.499
Hey, beautiful, let's take a walk.

41:14.038 --> 41:17.235
You know, you're much better-looking
without your Mace.

41:20.711 --> 41:23.305
Seriously, Nat, if you were
to open up a Peach Pit in Paris,

41:23.481 --> 41:27.349
it would only be a matter of time before
you were bigger than Jerry Lewis.

41:27.518 --> 41:30.612
Yeah, but then I'd have to walk around
the Champs Élysées yelling out:

41:30.788 --> 41:33.882
"Hey, Dean. Dean. "

41:35.359 --> 41:38.920
- Who's Dean?
- I don't know.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.567
So Felice didn't go
for the idea, huh?

41:45.736 --> 41:48.637
Not exactly.
Well, what did Jackie say?

41:49.106 --> 41:51.973
- Jackie was cool.
- Jackie's always cool.

41:53.444 --> 41:54.706
So your mom said no?

41:55.679 --> 41:58.147
No, it's a little more complicated
than that.

41:58.315 --> 42:00.783
See, my dad's moving to Houston.

42:01.485 --> 42:03.476
Wait a minute,
your parents are getting a divorce?

42:03.654 --> 42:07.055
No, my dad's getting a fellowship
for medical school.

42:07.224 --> 42:08.953
My mom's
just gonna be living there with him.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.586
And she wants you
to move to Houston with them?

42:11.762 --> 42:15.061
Well, she's a little concerned about me
staying in town by myself.

42:15.232 --> 42:18.759
Let alone move off-campus,
but she finally gave in.

42:19.403 --> 42:21.496
- You're kidding.
- That's great.

42:22.273 --> 42:23.638
Yeah.

42:24.775 --> 42:26.037
So, what's wrong?

42:26.710 --> 42:31.704
Well, she said I could live at the beach
with Kelly.

42:32.483 --> 42:35.145
And we could get
a two-bedroom apartment

42:35.319 --> 42:38.550
with only me and Kelly.

42:41.258 --> 42:42.486
So, what about me?

42:43.127 --> 42:47.621
So I didn't tell her
you were gonna be living there.

42:48.999 --> 42:50.296
Donna, I don't believe you.

42:56.106 --> 42:58.939
- Come on, let's go party in my room.
- All right!

43:02.079 --> 43:04.707
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:04.882 --> 43:09.342
- How was your aunt's party?
- Well, it wasn't too painful.

43:09.520 --> 43:12.887
Actually, it was kind of fun
seeing all the relatives again.

43:13.457 --> 43:15.891
I thought you were going
to that big bash at the Kappa House.

43:16.460 --> 43:19.657
I still am, but I waited around
in case you changed your mind.

43:21.298 --> 43:22.390
I don't know.

43:25.869 --> 43:26.961
Listen, Brenda,

43:28.772 --> 43:30.865
I know we got off
to a kind of bumpy start,

43:31.041 --> 43:34.568
but I just want you to know that
I'm really glad that we're roommates

43:34.745 --> 43:36.804
and that you decided
to come back home.

43:38.048 --> 43:39.072
Thanks.

43:44.221 --> 43:45.882
So should we go
check out this party?

43:46.056 --> 43:47.683
Yeah, after you.

44:14.118 --> 44:16.382
<i>I am sorry, monsieur,
there is no answer.</i>

44:16.553 --> 44:19.078
<i>Shall I try another number?</i>

44:20.891 --> 44:25.658
No, operator, that's okay.
I'll... Maybe I'll try again sometime.
