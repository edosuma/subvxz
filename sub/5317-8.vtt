WEBVTT

00:09.921 --> 00:11.823
Two, inside or out.

00:15.294 --> 00:16.595
No! No!

00:16.628 --> 00:17.262
No!

00:17.296 --> 00:18.863
Absolutely not!

00:18.897 --> 00:19.898
How dare you?

00:19.931 --> 00:21.766
Ambushing me with
this nonsense again!

00:21.800 --> 00:25.270
Do I look like I'm in the mood
for Sunday Funday?

00:25.304 --> 00:26.905
Okay, bye.

00:26.938 --> 00:28.207
Oh, no, wait!

00:28.240 --> 00:29.541
Please.

00:29.574 --> 00:31.876
Dorothy's joining us later,

00:31.910 --> 00:34.746
and it's just really important
she feel accepted.

00:34.779 --> 00:35.714
It-it-it...

00:35.747 --> 00:38.217
it would mean a lot
to Lindsay, too.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.119
She's living

00:40.152 --> 00:41.620
in Vernon's man cave.

00:46.125 --> 00:48.427
Oh, goddamn it.

00:50.095 --> 00:51.596
Fine.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.802
Good job.

00:57.836 --> 01:00.572
For a second I thought
you forgot this was a set-up.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.808
We'll give Gretchen
a fun Halloween day.

01:03.842 --> 01:06.145
She'll drink.
We'll do my list...

01:06.178 --> 01:07.222
Yeah, uh, your list is weird.

01:07.246 --> 01:08.280
That's the point.

01:08.313 --> 01:09.581
I tailored the activities

01:09.614 --> 01:11.916
for Gretchen's perverted
and morbid tastes.

01:11.950 --> 01:15.120
You just need to pretend
you wrote the list.

01:16.355 --> 01:18.290
There's no way
she'll be able to remain sad

01:18.323 --> 01:20.225
after a day like this.

01:23.695 --> 01:24.996
A toast.

01:25.029 --> 01:26.231
To the best day of the week.

01:26.265 --> 01:28.500
On the best day of the year!

01:28.533 --> 01:30.502
Spooky Sunday Funday.

01:30.535 --> 01:32.504
Ooh.

02:16.047 --> 02:17.316
Costumes?

02:17.349 --> 02:19.484
God. Seriously?

02:19.518 --> 02:22.487
Well, we have to wear costumes,
Gretchen.

02:22.521 --> 02:24.756
It's, uh, on the list.

02:29.060 --> 02:30.862
Oh, sorry, sir.

02:34.098 --> 02:35.166
Paul?

02:36.335 --> 02:38.036
Paul?

02:38.069 --> 02:39.204
Hello.

02:39.238 --> 02:40.372
Nine to sell you.

02:40.405 --> 02:42.607
Oh, no, dang it.

02:43.342 --> 02:45.877
Nice to send yogurt.

02:45.910 --> 02:48.580
I'm still working out the kinks
on this thing.

02:48.613 --> 02:50.315
Why are you in a wheelchair?

02:50.349 --> 02:52.083
Did Amy do this to you?

02:52.116 --> 02:53.252
I'm Stephen Hawking.

02:53.285 --> 02:54.719
The famous cosmologist.

02:54.753 --> 02:57.155
A crippled guy does makeup?

02:58.957 --> 03:01.360
So, you ever
get the power turned back on?

03:01.393 --> 03:03.262
No. Someone abandoned me,

03:03.295 --> 03:04.496
so I had to move into Becca's.

03:04.529 --> 03:05.930
Oh, Lindsay.

03:05.964 --> 03:07.366
What?

03:07.399 --> 03:09.434
Someday you're gonna
have to learn

03:09.468 --> 03:11.670
not to quit
when things gets hard.

03:11.703 --> 03:13.137
I'm not a quitter, Paul.

03:15.474 --> 03:17.208
I'm not!

03:17.242 --> 03:18.443
You'll see!

03:18.477 --> 03:20.445
I won't hole my bread.

03:20.479 --> 03:22.814
Dang it.

03:30.088 --> 03:31.256
Oh, my God.

03:31.290 --> 03:33.992
Edgar, look what I've
managed to toss together.

03:37.829 --> 03:39.398
Oh. Hey.

03:39.431 --> 03:42.601
Hmm?

03:43.568 --> 03:45.770
Heathstead from
Buckle Your Shoes!

03:45.804 --> 03:46.971
Never heard of it.

03:47.005 --> 03:48.640
It's about an assistant deacon

03:48.673 --> 03:50.275
who sleeps
with the constable's daughter

03:50.309 --> 03:52.477
and is forced to hide out
as a ladies' shoe salesman.

03:52.511 --> 03:54.245
You've never heard of it?

03:54.279 --> 03:58.317
These heels
are a bit small, love.

03:58.350 --> 04:01.653
Shall I stretch them out for ya?

04:02.354 --> 04:04.689
No? Come on.

04:12.864 --> 04:14.999
A doctor costume for ladies?

04:15.033 --> 04:16.334
Fake.

04:16.368 --> 04:19.504
Ugh, I can't find anything.

04:19.538 --> 04:21.172
You've barely looked.

04:21.204 --> 04:23.241
Oh, no.

04:23.274 --> 04:24.509
He's right.

04:24.543 --> 04:26.611
Paul said I give up
on things real easy.

04:26.645 --> 04:27.812
I don't do that, right?

04:27.846 --> 04:29.481
Interior design school,
cardio barre,

04:29.514 --> 04:30.782
season two of House of Cards.

04:30.815 --> 04:32.951
You even quit
Ralph's Reward Club

04:32.984 --> 04:34.362
'cause you couldn't handle
the commitment.

04:34.386 --> 04:35.654
What, I'm going to carry

04:35.687 --> 04:37.255
one of those shitty
little plastic cards

04:37.288 --> 04:39.057
on my keychain like a poor?

04:47.899 --> 04:51.536
Phone, how do I turn
on my power?

04:51.570 --> 04:53.872
Sex Goddess Lindsay 69,

04:53.905 --> 04:55.206
I found the phone number

04:55.239 --> 04:57.609
for Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power.

04:57.642 --> 04:58.719
Would you like me
to dial it for you?

04:58.743 --> 05:00.712
This thing never works.

05:02.213 --> 05:03.615
Hmm?

05:03.648 --> 05:05.183
No idea.

05:06.851 --> 05:08.820
So, you found anything yet?

05:08.853 --> 05:10.889
I'll just wear these wings.

05:10.922 --> 05:15.059
You can do better than
"saddest girl at the rave."

05:15.093 --> 05:16.728
What about that?

05:16.761 --> 05:19.097
These are fine.

05:21.566 --> 05:23.535
How much to rent that costume?

05:23.568 --> 05:25.737
Uh, 400 a day plus
a thousand-dollar deposit.

05:25.770 --> 05:27.439
Are you insane?

05:39.418 --> 05:40.819
I'm kind of nervous.

05:40.852 --> 05:43.354
You understand I'm not actually
inside your head.

05:43.388 --> 05:45.590
I haven't had sex

05:45.624 --> 05:47.592
In three years.

05:49.127 --> 05:50.228
What?

05:50.261 --> 05:51.530
Oh, my God!

05:51.563 --> 05:52.931
Dorothy's meeting us later and,

05:52.964 --> 05:54.833
well, we've gotten close...

05:54.866 --> 05:57.068
Yeah? How close?

05:57.101 --> 05:57.902
Over the bra.

05:57.936 --> 05:59.037
So, not close at all, then.

05:59.070 --> 06:00.439
Please don't tell anyone.

06:00.472 --> 06:01.716
Oh, believe me,
I won't tell anyone

06:01.740 --> 06:03.542
you still touch girls
over the bra.

06:03.575 --> 06:05.877
That's too embarrassing.

06:35.940 --> 06:37.141
All right, folks.

06:37.175 --> 06:39.544
On the third floor
is where, in 1954,

06:39.578 --> 06:40.745
former silent film star

06:40.779 --> 06:42.647
Poopsie Carmichael

06:42.681 --> 06:44.082
was killed by Nick O. Donnik,

06:44.115 --> 06:46.150
who went on a rampage,
killing seven

06:46.184 --> 06:47.819
in the building
while they slept.

06:47.852 --> 06:49.320
You might also recognize it

06:49.353 --> 06:51.890
from the opening credits
of Better Off Ted!

06:51.923 --> 06:55.026
So... three years, huh?

06:55.927 --> 06:57.629
Does Dorothy know?

06:57.662 --> 06:58.830
No, not yet.

06:58.863 --> 07:00.832
I should be honest
and tell her, huh?

07:00.865 --> 07:02.634
Shit no.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.268
Yeah, I'm not getting on a plane

07:04.302 --> 07:07.238
if the pilot just took
three years off flying.

07:07.271 --> 07:10.008
Also, can you imagine
the first time?

07:10.041 --> 07:12.811
It'd be like...

07:15.880 --> 07:19.017
So, why did you put
a murder tour on your list?

07:19.050 --> 07:20.018
Pssht!

07:20.051 --> 07:21.953
I'm totally into murder.

07:21.986 --> 07:23.855
I love it so much,

07:23.888 --> 07:25.490
I became a soldier.

07:25.524 --> 07:27.025
You can murder anyone you want.

07:27.058 --> 07:28.760
And for our final stop,

07:28.793 --> 07:30.328
we'll visit the sight
of the murder

07:30.361 --> 07:33.031
of one of hip-hop's
biggest stars.

07:33.064 --> 07:33.765
Ooh!

07:33.798 --> 07:36.067
Any guesses?

07:40.171 --> 07:43.474
Christopher George
Latore Wallace.

07:43.508 --> 07:44.843
Big Poppa.

07:44.876 --> 07:46.711
Who shot you, Biggie?

07:46.745 --> 07:48.479
This is fun, right?

07:48.513 --> 07:50.114
Yeah.

07:50.148 --> 07:52.226
And then
sometimes during the service window,

07:52.250 --> 07:54.686
the serviceman comes out,
checks the lines,

07:54.719 --> 07:55.787
checks the meters,

07:55.820 --> 07:57.488
lights the pilot light
if need be,

07:57.522 --> 07:58.890
and then you're reconnected.

07:58.923 --> 08:00.224
Sure, but then what happens?

08:00.258 --> 08:02.060
What's the next thing
to go wrong

08:02.093 --> 08:04.128
that I won't know how to fix?

08:04.162 --> 08:07.899
Hey, mo' money, mo' problems.

08:10.501 --> 08:13.071
That'll be five dollars.

08:13.104 --> 08:14.906
Who shot you, Biggie?

08:14.939 --> 08:16.708
Oh, my God!

08:16.741 --> 08:18.209
T.

08:18.242 --> 08:20.579
U.

08:22.413 --> 08:23.948
P.

08:26.685 --> 08:27.986
A...

08:28.019 --> 08:29.387
I knew it.

08:31.355 --> 08:33.457
I.

08:34.357 --> 08:35.693
L?

08:35.727 --> 08:36.928
Tupal?

08:36.961 --> 08:39.297
I don't know that fool.

08:43.768 --> 08:47.271
Oh, what's next, Edgar?

08:48.807 --> 08:50.374
Damn it.

08:53.444 --> 08:55.346
That's a pretty
convincing Baby Spice.

08:55.379 --> 08:56.514
He a'ight.

08:56.547 --> 08:59.784
You wanted to see
a Spice Girls cover band?

08:59.818 --> 09:01.519
Yeah.

09:01.552 --> 09:03.021
I love Spice Girls.

09:03.054 --> 09:05.957
Name three of their songs.

09:05.990 --> 09:09.460
"If You Wanna Be My Lover,"
is one.

09:09.493 --> 09:12.230
"You Gotta Get With My
Friends," is another.

09:12.263 --> 09:14.198
Oh, and the one where
she raps about slinging

09:14.232 --> 09:16.601
your body down and
winding it all around.

09:16.635 --> 09:18.302
That's all the same song, dummy.

09:18.336 --> 09:20.204
Excuse me, sir.

09:20.238 --> 09:21.906
I don't mean to be too forward,

09:21.940 --> 09:23.541
but you've caught me
with your Hook.

09:23.574 --> 09:25.777
You're at the top
of my Schindler's List.

09:25.810 --> 09:26.978
My loins are

09:27.011 --> 09:28.780
Terminally Always

09:28.813 --> 09:30.314
The Color Purple for you.

09:30.348 --> 09:33.217
So please open your Jaws
and make out with me.

09:33.251 --> 09:34.485
Munich.

09:38.990 --> 09:40.892
Guys, it's Dorothy!

09:40.925 --> 09:43.628
Oh, finally.

09:43.662 --> 09:45.997
I'm sure someone entrenched
in the comedy world

09:46.030 --> 09:47.832
will know what my costume is.

09:47.866 --> 09:49.400
Hmm?

09:49.433 --> 09:50.401
Drop Dead Fred?

09:50.434 --> 09:52.003
Century 21 salesman
of the month?

09:52.036 --> 09:53.513
The bassist for The
Mighty Mighty Bosstones?

09:53.537 --> 09:55.173
Gay Wolverine.

09:55.206 --> 09:58.977
Like anyone knows
who Edgar's supposed to be.

09:59.010 --> 10:02.313
The Situation from
The Jersey Shore...

10:02.346 --> 10:03.915
seven years later than relevant.

10:03.948 --> 10:05.183
Sorry, honey.

10:05.216 --> 10:07.118
I still want to
smooch on you though.

10:07.151 --> 10:09.420
Uh, yeah, um...

10:09.453 --> 10:10.354
we're in public.

10:10.388 --> 10:12.423
Oh, fine. Well, then later.

10:16.194 --> 10:18.697
Ooh! I'm want to Vine
those motorcycles.

10:23.401 --> 10:24.468
Wow.

10:24.502 --> 10:26.604
Looks like that dry spell
is about to end.

10:26.637 --> 10:29.207
Try not to blow a hole
through her back.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.475
I like Dorothy so much,

10:31.509 --> 10:34.879
but I'm scared that if we
go past a certain point,

10:34.913 --> 10:36.881
I'll have to tell her
about my problems,

10:36.915 --> 10:39.250
and I'm just not ready.

10:40.151 --> 10:41.786
Who gives a shit
if you're ready.

10:41.820 --> 10:44.055
Three years worth
of backed-up jizz

10:44.088 --> 10:45.656
in your balls is not healthy.

10:45.690 --> 10:47.401
Yeah, but it's not
about the jizz in my balls.

10:47.425 --> 10:50.028
It's about the jizz
in my brain and in my heart.

10:50.061 --> 10:52.463
The jizz in my heart, Jimmy.

10:52.496 --> 10:53.765
Can we go home now?

10:57.035 --> 11:00.338
Uh, actually, Gretchen,
there's one more stop.

11:00.371 --> 11:01.672
Ah.

11:01.706 --> 11:02.741
The grand finale.

11:02.774 --> 11:04.308
The grand finale?

11:04.342 --> 11:06.310
Yeah, it's Italian
for "big final."

11:06.344 --> 11:09.213
No, I... Never mind. What is it?

11:15.920 --> 11:18.189
Smile for the camera, maggot.

11:21.793 --> 11:24.095
Okay.

11:24.128 --> 11:26.765
There is no exiting once
you go through those doors.

11:26.798 --> 11:28.266
There is no safeword.

11:28.299 --> 11:30.334
There are no rules.

11:31.402 --> 11:32.937
Acknowledge!

11:32.971 --> 11:35.139
Yeah, yeah. Yes, sir.
Okay. Okay.

11:49.587 --> 11:51.422
This isn't so scary.

12:19.583 --> 12:21.752
I want to go home.

12:25.623 --> 12:26.991
Right.

12:27.025 --> 12:29.160
I'd prefer not to
interact with a mouse.

12:29.193 --> 12:30.628
Shut up, maggot!

12:30.661 --> 12:33.131
This mouse is going to eat
your ugly pussy face.

12:33.164 --> 12:34.174
Then he'll burrow
down your throat

12:34.198 --> 12:35.733
and eat your gory heart.

12:35.766 --> 12:37.411
Then he'll chew through your
intestines until he goddamn

12:37.435 --> 12:39.337
chews his way out of
your asshole

12:39.370 --> 12:41.505
so all of your bloody,
gory, chewed-out intestines

12:41.539 --> 12:43.307
flop out of your
body onto the floor

12:43.341 --> 12:45.076
like a shitty garden hose!

12:45.109 --> 12:46.077
Oh, no, Jimmy!

12:46.110 --> 12:48.813
You're so screwed!

12:55.786 --> 12:57.221
Whoa!

13:00.058 --> 13:01.392
This sucks.

13:05.029 --> 13:07.698
Why are you doing this to us?

13:09.667 --> 13:12.470
Why is this happening?

13:15.539 --> 13:16.539
Ah!

13:32.323 --> 13:34.125
Is that all you pussies got!?

13:34.158 --> 13:35.894
Ha-ha! Jimmy!

13:35.927 --> 13:37.228
What's going on, guys?

13:37.261 --> 13:38.662
What are you doing here?

13:38.696 --> 13:40.331
I'm a horror house nerd
from way back.

13:40.364 --> 13:42.242
After this, I'm heading
to another one in Sylmar.

13:42.266 --> 13:44.335
They've got a real,
live Babadook.

13:44.368 --> 13:46.470
You guys should totally...!

13:50.942 --> 13:52.944
Ah...

13:55.246 --> 13:56.180
You good?

13:56.214 --> 13:57.248
I'm great!

13:57.281 --> 13:58.883
This place is nuts!

13:58.917 --> 14:02.720
You guys probably
shouldn't sit on that couch.

14:08.292 --> 14:10.828
Hello?

14:10.861 --> 14:12.463
Hello?

14:14.465 --> 14:15.633
Hello?

14:17.068 --> 14:18.169
Oh, my God.

14:18.202 --> 14:20.771
Where am I?

14:20.804 --> 14:22.840
Help me!

14:22.873 --> 14:26.410
No one can help you, Lindsay.

14:26.444 --> 14:29.047
You're all alone now!

14:29.080 --> 14:30.949
How did you know my name?!

14:30.982 --> 14:32.283
Shh.

14:32.316 --> 14:34.953
I don't like the taste
of fear in my meat.

14:50.234 --> 14:51.802
Um...

14:51.835 --> 14:53.904
What are you doing?

14:53.938 --> 14:55.139
What I always do.

14:55.173 --> 14:57.475
I'm giving up.

14:57.508 --> 14:58.576
Um...

14:58.609 --> 14:59.810
Good!

14:59.843 --> 15:02.480
It'll make it easier
for me to rip open your flesh

15:02.513 --> 15:04.615
and make a cape from your skin.

15:04.648 --> 15:06.817
I'll probably make
a shitty cape!

15:06.850 --> 15:09.553
Just like I'm a shitty wife.

15:09.587 --> 15:11.956
Just like
I'm a shitty homeowner.

15:11.990 --> 15:14.959
I can't even turn my power on.

15:14.993 --> 15:16.594
How pathetic is that?

15:19.697 --> 15:22.433
Have you tried calling
customer service?

15:41.052 --> 15:42.253
No. No!

15:42.286 --> 15:44.055
No! No!

15:55.399 --> 15:57.135
Oh, hell yeah!

15:57.168 --> 15:58.502
Ha-ha!

15:58.536 --> 16:02.040
Our Father, Who art in heaven,

16:02.073 --> 16:04.108
hallowed be Thy name...

16:05.809 --> 16:06.777
Oh, damn!

16:08.479 --> 16:10.014
This is almost over, right?

16:10.048 --> 16:11.215
You'll be fine.

16:11.249 --> 16:12.350
Just breathe.

16:18.189 --> 16:19.057
See?

16:22.093 --> 16:23.794
Oh, my God.

16:23.827 --> 16:25.063
Stop!

16:25.096 --> 16:26.397
Stop!

16:26.430 --> 16:28.832
Edgar, stop!

16:28.866 --> 16:31.235
I'm telling!

16:31.269 --> 16:33.637
I have to tell you something.
Okay.

16:33.671 --> 16:36.974
I have... residual issues

16:37.007 --> 16:38.409
from...

16:38.442 --> 16:41.312
I'm sorry I never told you.

16:41.345 --> 16:44.248
I'm honored that you
trust me enough to tell me.

16:44.282 --> 16:47.017
Also, I haven't had sex
in three years.

16:47.051 --> 16:49.887
Is that why you keep
touching me over the bra?

16:51.289 --> 16:52.956
Three years, huh?

17:03.201 --> 17:04.867
This whole thing is derivative.

17:04.902 --> 17:05.836
It's homage.

17:05.868 --> 17:07.871
Face it, horror
films are legacy.

17:07.905 --> 17:09.406
Forget about movies.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.376
This is the golden age
of television. TV owns.

17:20.251 --> 17:23.621
Ah... ah...

17:25.756 --> 17:28.226
Hey, we all get overwhelmed.

17:28.259 --> 17:29.560
If a problem seems too big,

17:29.593 --> 17:31.395
try breaking it up
into smaller chunks.

17:31.429 --> 17:32.696
It's called chunking.

17:32.730 --> 17:34.932
There's a really great
TED talk about it.

17:34.965 --> 17:36.767
Huh.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.801
"Chunking"?

17:37.835 --> 17:39.069
Okay, you ready?

17:39.103 --> 17:40.471
Now, when the voice comes on

17:40.504 --> 17:41.872
and asks you what you want,

17:41.905 --> 17:42.973
you say "operator."

17:43.006 --> 17:44.942
Then they'll do this thing
where they say,

17:44.975 --> 17:47.245
"While you wait, what is
the nature of your problem?"

17:47.278 --> 17:48.479
That's a trick.

17:48.512 --> 17:50.080
Just say "operator" again.

17:50.114 --> 17:51.682
You want me to dial for you?

17:53.251 --> 17:54.585
No.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.322
I can do it myself.

17:58.356 --> 18:01.592
Attagirl.

18:14.472 --> 18:16.082
They weren't kidding
about that no rules thing.

18:16.106 --> 18:18.576
That-that little girl
with her arms on backwards

18:18.609 --> 18:20.344
straight-up bit my tit.

18:20.378 --> 18:21.512
That was so much fun!

18:21.545 --> 18:23.747
I knew it would work.

18:23.781 --> 18:25.683
What would? This whole day.

18:25.716 --> 18:27.585
To whack you out of your funk.

18:27.618 --> 18:29.119
I made you think
it was Edgar's idea,

18:29.153 --> 18:30.454
but it was mine.

18:30.488 --> 18:31.922
Goddamn it, Jimmy!

18:31.955 --> 18:32.856
I knew it!

18:32.890 --> 18:34.458
I mean... no, I didn't know it,

18:34.492 --> 18:35.459
but I knew it!

18:35.493 --> 18:36.927
Wait, you...

18:36.960 --> 18:38.805
you're mad at me because
you had a good time? No!

18:38.829 --> 18:41.532
I am mad at you because
you think you can fix me!

18:41.565 --> 18:43.601
You can't fix me, Jimmy.

18:43.634 --> 18:45.336
I don't need to be fixed.

18:45.369 --> 18:46.704
Wow.

18:46.737 --> 18:48.872
Well...

18:48.906 --> 18:52.042
I'm sorry I tried to give you
a nice day.

18:52.075 --> 18:53.744
What an asshole.

19:08.226 --> 19:09.227
Where's Jimmy?

19:09.260 --> 19:10.461
He left.

19:10.494 --> 19:11.629
He's trying to fix me.

19:11.662 --> 19:13.831
Of course he is, he's Jimmy.

19:13.864 --> 19:15.866
He's not gonna stop, you know.

19:18.836 --> 19:20.671
Unless...

19:20.704 --> 19:23.674
he thinks he fixed me already.

19:25.609 --> 19:28.011
That's a great Heathstead.

19:29.380 --> 19:30.648
What?

19:30.681 --> 19:32.082
Your costume.

19:32.115 --> 19:35.052
Heathstead, from
Buckle Your Shoes, right?

19:36.554 --> 19:37.921
Yeah.

19:37.955 --> 19:40.424
No one has gotten it all day.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.159
Seriously?

19:42.192 --> 19:44.728
Remember when Maggie Cornelia
has the bunion?

19:44.762 --> 19:47.265
But he can't tell her,

19:47.298 --> 19:49.567
because she's redoing her will.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.202
And the dog? And the dog, yeah!

19:53.304 --> 19:55.839
Ah...

19:55.873 --> 19:56.674
Rough day?

19:56.707 --> 19:59.743
Oh, yeah. Halloween.

19:59.777 --> 20:01.345
It's a stupid holiday.

20:01.379 --> 20:02.713
I like it.

20:02.746 --> 20:05.082
It's good for business.

20:05.115 --> 20:06.384
Speaking of which,

20:06.417 --> 20:07.727
I should probably
get back in there.

20:07.751 --> 20:09.287
Don't want to piss off the boss.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.821
Ah, she's a pushover.

20:12.089 --> 20:13.457
It's my bar.

20:13.491 --> 20:15.192
I'm Nina.

20:15.225 --> 20:16.694
Keune.

20:16.727 --> 20:20.364
I've been serving you
for the last... few months.

20:20.398 --> 20:22.600
Oh. Sorry, I...

20:22.633 --> 20:24.034
I don't remember people.

20:24.067 --> 20:26.036
That's okay.

20:26.069 --> 20:28.639
Hey, maybe I'll, uh, come join
you when things cool down.

20:28.672 --> 20:29.973
We need to talk about

20:30.007 --> 20:32.310
when lolanthe left Crumpleton
for London.

20:32.343 --> 20:37.214
She always did
refuse to accept her station.

20:54.432 --> 20:55.399
You were right!

20:55.433 --> 20:56.834
It's crazy,

20:56.867 --> 20:58.669
but I feel like
a whole new person.

20:58.702 --> 21:02.005
I guess all I needed was
a fun day doing things I liked.

21:02.039 --> 21:03.574
Well, then.

21:03.607 --> 21:06.176
Wow, that's... that's great.

21:06.209 --> 21:07.511
Yes, it is.

21:07.545 --> 21:09.380
Smart, smart man.

21:10.348 --> 21:12.082
How'd you know I was coming?

21:12.115 --> 21:15.386
Oh, I just had a feeling
everything would work out.

21:23.327 --> 21:25.529
Oh, my God, the guy
coming out of the tub.

21:25.563 --> 21:27.531
And the guy with the...

21:27.565 --> 21:29.199
Helen Keller thing?

21:32.570 --> 21:34.472
Oh, she's coming!

21:34.505 --> 21:35.506
Let's go!

21:35.539 --> 21:37.207
Go, go! Go! Go!

21:37.240 --> 21:38.342
Go, go!

21:38.376 --> 21:39.710

Schweppes! Schweppes!

24:31.915 --> 24:35.753

24:37.220 --> 24:38.756
Don't have it.
