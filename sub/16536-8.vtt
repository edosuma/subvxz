WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:03.462
<i>Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>

00:03.586 --> 00:05.589
- Majid Nassar is dead?
- They say he was poisoned.

00:05.715 --> 00:07.383
Peter MacLeish
has closer ties to the attack

00:07.508 --> 00:09.593
than Nassar ever did,
and we have evidence of that.

00:09.719 --> 00:10.970
Kirkman needs to know that.

00:11.095 --> 00:13.764
We're never gonna find a better candidate
for vice president than MacLeish.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.933
Please tell me
that you've got some answers.

00:16.058 --> 00:17.768
We're looking
into every possibility.

00:17.893 --> 00:21.063
I never thought I'd be dealing with this
again, whether or not Leo was mine.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.648
Catalan's a mercenary
and a traitor.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.817
- I know who killed Nassar.
- Your son will be safe

00:24.942 --> 00:26.902
as long as you do
everything I tell you to do.

00:27.028 --> 00:29.947
Make an appointment
with the president. I'll be in touch.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.962
This is the Janazah of Majid Nassar.

00:45.546 --> 00:50.342
The date is February 6th.
The time is 21:08.

01:10.988 --> 01:14.700
Tomorrow marks a momentous occasion
in our nation's history.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.702
It's an unprecedented election

01:16.827 --> 01:19.371
to choose a new House of Representatives.

01:19.497 --> 01:21.832
It is also the next
and perhaps most important step

01:21.957 --> 01:24.627
President Kirkman is taking
to re-establish our government

01:24.752 --> 01:26.504
in the wake of the Capitol attack.

01:26.629 --> 01:28.214
The president urges every American,

01:28.339 --> 01:30.341
no matter
what their political affiliation,

01:30.466 --> 01:33.135
get out there tomorrow and cast a vote.
Yeah, Natalie.

01:33.260 --> 01:37.223
Seth, is the White House concerned
about a new strain of the H5N1 super-flu?

01:37.348 --> 01:40.309
12 reported cases in the Kansas City area
in the last 24 hours,

01:40.434 --> 01:41.393
all resistant to known treatment--

01:41.519 --> 01:45.147
Yeah, so far the CDC's been tracking that,
and there's no cause for alarm, okay?

01:45.272 --> 01:47.525
If there are no further questions,
thank you all for very much

01:47.650 --> 01:51.654
- for another exciting briefing.
- Seth, is Majid Nassar dead?

01:56.200 --> 01:58.077
- Aaron.
- I know.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.830
<i>I have a source at Fort Bragg,
says a Muslim chaplain</i>

02:00.955 --> 02:03.249
<i>was put on a plane yesterday at 6:00 p.m.</i>

02:03.374 --> 02:05.417
Told to prepare for a Muslim burial.

02:05.543 --> 02:09.088
A second source confirms
it was for a high-value prisoner,

02:09.213 --> 02:10.840
almost certainly Majid Nassar.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.343
Yes, that's true.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.679
<i>Two days ago,
Majid Nassar was found dead</i>

02:16.804 --> 02:18.097
in his jail cell.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.724
The circumstances of his capture,
detention, and interrogation

02:20.850 --> 02:22.560
are all matters of national security,
and I have--

02:22.685 --> 02:26.063
Seth, is he dead because of enhanced
interrogation techniques,

02:26.188 --> 02:28.232
or what some would call torture?

02:28.357 --> 02:30.943
No. The prisoner was kept
in the strictest accordance

02:31.068 --> 02:34.113
with the Geneva Convention. This
president would have it no other way.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.532
<i>I'm sorry, that's really
all I can tell you at this time.</i>

02:36.657 --> 02:38.534
<i>Thank you guys.</i>

02:40.911 --> 02:42.746
- Mr. President.
- Seth did the right thing.

02:42.872 --> 02:44.915
We agreed. If it came up,
we would go with the truth.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.959
I would have liked it if we could have
announced it ourselves,

02:47.084 --> 02:49.295
- but we didn't have the facts.
- Unfortunately, this is only gonna lead

02:49.420 --> 02:50.713
to more questions about Nassar's death.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.548
And your integrity.
They're saying he died of torture.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.967
- Seth denied that.
- With all due respect, Mr. President,

02:55.092 --> 02:57.219
simply saying no
lacks a certain specificity

02:57.344 --> 02:58.637
that the press will not accept.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.807
If we don't address this right away
in detail, it'll dominate the headlines.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.601
It'll force the elections
to take a back seat.

03:03.726 --> 03:05.269
Where are we at with the investigation?

03:06.562 --> 03:08.480
Atwood finally called back.
He'll be here at 10:00.

03:08.606 --> 03:10.399
Let's hope he's got something for us
this time.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.087
I owe you a bear claw.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.673
You've been here all night?

03:34.798 --> 03:36.967
You're wearing the same thing
you wore yesterday.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.261
Who's that? A new lead?

03:39.386 --> 03:41.263
Just a witness statement
I never got around to reading.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.099
Hey, has Jason logged into the system
yet? I haven't seen him.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.644
His office is looking for him too.
He's not answering texts or e-mails.

03:46.769 --> 03:48.979
I figured if anyone knew
where he was, it'd be you.

03:50.648 --> 03:52.149
Speak of the devil.

03:59.657 --> 04:00.991
Jason.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.452
Is Luke okay?
Did you-- Did you find him?

04:03.577 --> 04:04.870
Yeah, he was--

04:04.995 --> 04:06.372
He was at his friend's house.

04:06.497 --> 04:09.208
- I called 10 times last night.
- I know. Thank you.

04:09.333 --> 04:12.169
- I'm sorry I didn't get back to you.
- I was worried. Thought it might be...

04:12.294 --> 04:14.838
Conspiracy? No, no.

04:14.964 --> 04:15.965
Thank God it wasn't.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.382
No, he, um...

04:18.926 --> 04:21.136
...wasn't where
he was supposed to be.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.433
You know, Jason, if you ever
need anything, I'm here to help.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.018
Thank you.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.651
You gonna answer that?

04:36.193 --> 04:40.114
- Yeah, when you give me some privacy.
- Of course.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.449
Agent Wells, you want to help?

04:43.033 --> 04:45.035
Look into the Weddle case.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.538
The Weddle case?
What does that have to do with anything?

04:47.663 --> 04:48.664
Thank you.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.751
Hello?

04:52.876 --> 04:53.919
<i>Good morning, Jason.</i>

04:54.044 --> 04:55.337
Yeah, I, um...

04:55.462 --> 04:57.756
- I set up the meeting with the president.
<i>- That's very good.</i>

04:57.881 --> 05:00.217
<i>And we appreciate you not telling anyone
about our conversation.</i>

05:00.342 --> 05:02.344
Luke does, too.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.096
I want to speak to my son right now.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.973
<i>Stay in your office.
Wait for our next call.</i>

05:07.141 --> 05:09.226
Hello?

05:14.732 --> 05:15.858
Hey, Chuck.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.693
Listen, keep this between us,

05:17.818 --> 05:19.945
but get me everything you can
on the Weddle case.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.155
Why?

05:21.697 --> 05:23.073
I don't know yet.

05:23.741 --> 05:26.952
With all due respect,
Mr. President, as half of Congress,

05:27.077 --> 05:30.080
I shouldn't have to find out
about Nassar's death on my RSS feed.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.248
You're absolutely right.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.625
And I know. And I am sorry.

05:33.751 --> 05:36.211
I just didn't feel comfortable
saying anything until we knew.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.464
You really don't know
who killed Majid Nassar?

05:38.589 --> 05:39.465
Or how? Or why?

05:39.590 --> 05:41.258
Unfortunately, no.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.635
Obviously, the investigation
is under way.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.472
I promise you, from now on, we will
keep you and your office informed.

05:46.597 --> 05:50.309
The man was in a military prison
under maximum security.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.812
Two days have gone by, no one
can tell us how he managed to die?

05:53.937 --> 05:57.149
I don't disagree with you. It's bad.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.401
And I know that you and I
have had our differences,

05:59.526 --> 06:01.320
but we cannot allow
this one instance

06:01.445 --> 06:03.572
to overshadow the importance
of tomorrow's elections.

06:03.697 --> 06:07.785
This is the first step that we are taking
to rebuilding our country.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.162
We need our government
to work at full strength,

06:10.287 --> 06:12.581
and it cannot without
its Congress and its Speaker.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.798
I'll do everything I can
to get you that Congress.

06:21.632 --> 06:22.800
Thank you.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.134
Mr. President.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.474
Mr. President. I'm sorry.
This is an emergency.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.643
It's about that situation in Kansas City.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.353
This is Dr. Arnold from the CDC,

06:34.478 --> 06:35.938
Lieutenant Colonel Gatz,
Army Medical.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.482
- What's going on?
- That flu outbreak in the Midwest--

06:38.607 --> 06:40.192
- It's not the flu, sir.
- What is it?

06:40.317 --> 06:42.152
I'm afraid
it's far more serious, Mr. President.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.863
The infected are victims
of a synthetic toxin.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.990
- Toxin?
- Ricin, sir.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.867
In extreme-fine powder form.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.035
My God.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.703
It's not an epidemic, sir.

06:51.829 --> 06:54.998
No. It's an act of bioterrorism.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.180
Each of the 12 confirmed cases

07:10.305 --> 07:13.183
varies in age, background,
and occupation.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.518
A 73-year-old retired schoolteacher,

07:14.643 --> 07:16.562
a 31-year-old
construction crane operator,

07:16.687 --> 07:18.647
a 55-year-old
agricultural equipment salesman.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.483
Other than they're all from the greater
Kansas City metro area,

07:21.608 --> 07:23.068
we haven't uncovered any other link.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.362
Beside the fact that
they've all be exposed to ricin.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.989
How is the toxin transmitted?

07:27.114 --> 07:29.408
- It's still unclear.
- And DHS has no idea of a motive?

07:29.533 --> 07:31.410
I've got every DHS agency
working on this.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.745
We have ideas about motives,
but nothing solid, sir.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.581
Do any of those ideas include Al-Sakar,

07:35.706 --> 07:38.083
in retaliation for the capture
and now death of Majid Nassar?

07:38.208 --> 07:39.543
That's our most likely scenario.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.420
Very good. Keep me apprised
of the situation.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.046
Obviously, time is of the essence.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.715
Thank you all.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.509
So, how long you on carpool duty?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.720
The agency's just easing me
back into the job

07:49.845 --> 07:53.098
- till I'm back up to speed.
- Well, if it helps, I got my permit.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.267
Next time I can drive,
and you can ride in back.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.518
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.770
When you learn to assemble
a Glock 9mm with one hand,

07:58.896 --> 08:00.439
and drive backwards
around an S-curve

08:00.564 --> 08:02.733
- at 90 miles an hour, I might let you.
- Leo?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.277
- Hey, buddy.
- You know this guy?

08:05.402 --> 08:06.737
Jared Abbott.
I'm with the <i>Chronicle.</i>

08:06.862 --> 08:09.781
Leo, what do you think of the rumor
that the president isn't your father?

08:09.907 --> 08:11.116
Leo, get inside the school. Now.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.785
That your real dad is actually
an inmate in a federal prison?

08:13.911 --> 08:16.288
The president's kids are off-limits,
and you're on private property.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.457
Step like that again,
and I'll put you on the ground.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.084
Drew, get this fool out of here.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.424
Sorry about that.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.637
It's gonna happen from time to time
now that you're in the public eye,

08:31.762 --> 08:34.097
but it doesn't mean
you got to respond to every rumor.

08:35.015 --> 08:35.974
Right?

08:36.099 --> 08:37.267
Yeah.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.688
I gotta get to class.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.575
- Hello?
<i>- Go to your car.</i>

08:53.700 --> 08:55.577
<i>- We'll send further instructions.</i>
- Listen to me.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.996
I'm not gonna do another thing
until I hear from my son.

08:58.121 --> 09:02.459
<i>- You're in no position to negotiate.</i>
- I want to hear my son.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.003
Luke...

09:05.128 --> 09:06.296
it's your dad.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.714
<i>Daddy?</i>

09:09.591 --> 09:10.676
Luke.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.136
- I want to go home.
<i>- I know, baby.</i>

09:13.262 --> 09:14.846
Uh...

09:14.972 --> 09:17.307
where did... where did we go
for your birthday this year?

09:17.432 --> 09:19.142
We went to Disney World.

09:19.268 --> 09:21.019
Right, and what's your favorite ride?

09:21.144 --> 09:23.313
Mission: SPACE.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.068
I'm gonna bring you home soon, okay?

09:30.320 --> 09:32.823
Go to your car, agent. Now.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.032
Read this.

10:58.742 --> 11:02.746
Once you're face-to-face with Kirkman,
I want you to do exactly as it says.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.462
- There's no way I'm doing this.
- These are the terms, Jason.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.548
This is not a negotiation.
You have an hour.

11:13.674 --> 11:17.135
After that, you'll either find your son
safe at home...

11:17.260 --> 11:18.428
or not.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.723
You do know you're not gonna
get away with this?

11:21.848 --> 11:23.225
You know we're watching.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.227
It's your choice how this plays out.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.495
Homeland Security
thinks the ricin attack

11:43.620 --> 11:45.497
is most likely retribution
for Nassar's death.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.333
The public needs to feel safe if they're
gonna get out and vote tomorrow.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.169
I know. We're running through a variety
of situations to try and accomplish that.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.338
Hey, sweetheart.
Why aren't you at school?

11:53.463 --> 11:55.298
Everything all right?

11:55.632 --> 11:58.135
Um, I'm not sure how to ask this, but...

12:00.095 --> 12:01.346
are you my real father?

12:01.471 --> 12:03.181
- What?
- Of course I'm your father.

12:03.306 --> 12:04.766
Why would you even ask that?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.309
This reporter asked me at school.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.523
Leo, please sit down.

12:11.648 --> 12:15.819
I don't understand why the reporter
would even ask me that question.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.196
Look, I understand how hurt
that must have made you feel.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.490
Please, Leo, just sit down.
Let me try and--

12:22.159 --> 12:23.785
Sweetheart, listen to me.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.288
Before I met your dad,
I was with someone else.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.206
- And when we broke up, I--
- Wait, wait, wait.

12:28.331 --> 12:31.042
So... So you don't know for sure
who my dad is.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.837
Leo, I'm your dad. Look,
your mom and I were getting married.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.715
She was pregnant with you, our son.
That's all we cared about.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.551
- You guys were never gonna tell me?
- Leo, there was nothing to tell you.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.970
Leo, come back here!
We need to talk about this now.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.182
- Tom, give him a second, okay?
- I'm not waiting to take this DNA test.

12:47.684 --> 12:48.977
This better be an emergency.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.564
<i>Sir, the CDC has new information
about the situation in Kansas City.</i>

12:52.689 --> 12:53.982
Thank you.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.901
What's the update on the ricin attack?

12:56.026 --> 12:57.402
CDC found the link, sir.

12:57.527 --> 12:58.904
All the victims are poll workers.

12:59.029 --> 13:01.740
- Poll workers?
- Volunteers, sir, for tomorrow's election.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.242
Homeland Security says the ricin
was deposited on the machines,

13:04.367 --> 13:05.994
where it could become airborne
and inhaled.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.747
Whoever did this was trying to infect
people while they were voting.

13:08.872 --> 13:11.041
It's not just an isolated attack
on some polls.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.544
Damn right.
This is an attack on the election itself.

13:18.173 --> 13:21.510
As much as I want these elections
to happen, I don't think we can risk it.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.553
Sir, there's still a chance
the FBI and DHS

13:23.678 --> 13:25.430
can give the all-clear
before the elections.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.600
It's possible as many as 146 million
people are gonna vote tomorrow.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.061
Do you honestly think
that they can inspect every machine

13:31.186 --> 13:34.022
- in every booth across all 50 states?
- Sir, we still have a day.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.024
ATF has several promising leads.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.401
No, Aaron. We've got 17 hours.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.696
17 hours if we're gonna save
this election.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.996
Sir, we have to try.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.214
You're right.

14:00.006 --> 14:03.468
You're right. Okay.
Contact the FBI, CDC, and DHS.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.638
Get them to form a joint task force.
Mobilize them immediately.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.099
I want updates as soon as they come in.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.309
Seth, tell the press
the inspections are precautionary

14:11.434 --> 14:15.146
due to the state of alert in the country.
We've got 17 hours, everybody.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.148
17 hours. Good luck.

14:17.274 --> 14:18.733
Yes, sir.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.027
Seth, can I borrow you for a second?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.947
I thought you said the Jeffrey Meyers
story was dead.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.615
- It was.
- Then can you explain to me

14:25.740 --> 14:29.119
why a reporter asked my son in front
of his school if I was his real father?

14:29.244 --> 14:31.580
- I'm sorry, sir. I'll find out.
- I would appreciate it.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.290
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.181
Yeah?

14:50.307 --> 14:53.351
- Hannah, I looked into the Weddle case.
- I don't have time for that right now.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.020
<i>- I'm trying to find Atwood.</i>
- Hear me out.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.855
That case was closed eight years ago.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.691
- Okay.
<i>- Weddle was this DEA special agent.</i>

14:59.816 --> 15:01.818
He built an airtight case
against a local cartel,

15:01.943 --> 15:03.486
until the cartel kidnapped
Weddle's daughter

15:03.612 --> 15:05.196
and forced him to recant everything.

15:05.322 --> 15:08.658
The case was thrown out,
and all charges dropped.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.202
Okay, I need you to track Jason's phone.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.163
You-- You--

15:13.288 --> 15:15.373
A-- A deputy director
of the FBI? Our boss?

15:15.498 --> 15:16.708
Listen to me.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.044
The photo you saw this morning
wasn't a witness statement.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.171
<i>It's the man who killed Majid Nassar.</i>

15:21.296 --> 15:23.798
I think the people who did this
are trying to make Jason do something.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.717
I don't know. But I need to know
where he is.

15:25.842 --> 15:26.718
<i>Now.</i>

15:33.850 --> 15:35.894
- We got a problem here.
- What?

15:36.019 --> 15:38.229
Atwood's an expert
in surveillance detection.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.856
He must have pulled
the cellphone battery.

15:39.981 --> 15:40.857
I can't locate it.

15:41.358 --> 15:44.694
Well, hack into his in-car nav.
Something, anything.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.406
Okay, give me a second
and speak kindly about me at my trial.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.248
Okay. I got him.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.042
He's making a left onto H Street.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.752
- From where?
- 24th.

16:00.877 --> 16:03.088
<i>He's making a left.</i>

16:03.213 --> 16:04.255
<i>A right.</i>

16:04.381 --> 16:06.383
- Now he's heading east.
- On what?

16:07.717 --> 16:09.052
Pennsylvania.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.597
The White House.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.603
<i>Yes, it is a unique election</i>

16:18.728 --> 16:20.522
<i>that keeps getting
even more unusual</i>

16:20.647 --> 16:23.441
<i>now that it's threatened
by reports of ricin at the polls.</i>

16:23.566 --> 16:26.236
- Hey, Lisa. Got a second?
- Hey. What's going on?

16:26.361 --> 16:27.612
<i>The White House has yet to...</i>

16:27.737 --> 16:30.615
The Leo Kirkman story, I thought you said
you were gonna make it go away.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.450
- I did.
- Really?

16:32.575 --> 16:35.704
Some journalist showed up
at Leo's school today,

16:35.829 --> 16:39.124
- blindsided him.
- Seth, I-I-I warned you.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.959
Just because I didn't run with the story

16:41.084 --> 16:43.253
didn't mean someone else
wasn't gonna look into this eventually.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.130
So it's just a coincidence that
that reporter was

16:45.255 --> 16:47.257
some stringer from your paper?
A kid named Jared Abbott.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.968
I don't know what to tell you.
My editor is a dog with a bone.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.803
He must have put him on it
after I bailed.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.431
- Do you want me to look into it?
- No. It's okay. I got it from here.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.151
I'm Special Agent Hannah Wells.

17:06.276 --> 17:09.319
The car you just let through, the silver
one, that was my boss, Jason Atwood.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.281
I was supposed to be in the car with him,
but I was late.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.825
- Are you on the pre-cleared visitors list?
- As I said, I was late.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.492
I was supposed to be with him.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.454
You know better than that, ma'am.
You're either on the pre-cleared list,

17:17.579 --> 17:19.955
- or you're not getting in.
- Okay.

17:23.877 --> 17:24.961
Come on.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.173
Jason, I looked into the Weddle case.

17:28.298 --> 17:31.509
What happened to that DEA agent
could have been avoided if he had help.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.804
Let me help you.
Let's figure this out together. Come on.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.024
Director Atwood. Please, come in.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.568
- Thank you, Wyatt.
- Mr. President.

17:50.904 --> 17:53.239
- Take a seat.
- I'm fine, sir.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.204
It's been two days
since Nassar was found dead.

17:59.329 --> 18:02.457
I hope to God that you're coming to me
with some answers this time.

18:06.461 --> 18:07.670
I am, sir.

18:08.838 --> 18:13.802
Majid Nassar was killed by a lethal dose
of a poison called thallium.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.220
It was mixed into his food.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.347
Do we know who had access to his food?

18:18.473 --> 18:20.016
Yes, sir.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.852
I did.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.646
I'm sorry. What did you say?

18:25.480 --> 18:27.565
I poisoned his food.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.485
Excuse me, Director.
I either misheard you or you misspoke.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.821
No, you heard me correctly.
I poisoned...

18:34.280 --> 18:36.157
Majid Nassar.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.327
That doesn't make sense.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.912
Wh-- Why would you do that?

18:41.037 --> 18:42.872
After speaking to him,

18:43.540 --> 18:46.876
it was clear we wouldn't get anything,
ever.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.212
A man like that doesn't deserve to live.

18:49.337 --> 18:53.007
I did it for all those
that lost their lives at the Capitol.

18:53.133 --> 18:57.053
I did it for my country,
and I did it for my family.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.265
My son...

19:02.058 --> 19:04.018
My son should not have
to live in a world

19:04.144 --> 19:07.397
where evil like this is allowed to exist.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.274
I acted alone,

19:09.399 --> 19:11.860
and I would do it again, no question.

19:12.527 --> 19:15.989
When the toxicology report comes in,
it'll confirm everything that I've said.

19:16.406 --> 19:19.325
I killed Majid Nassar.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.581
Press the button, sir.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.388
Mr. President,
step away from the desk.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.483
The toxicologist
just performed the spot test

19:52.609 --> 19:54.652
for thallium poisoning.
It was positive, sir.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.821
There's no way Atwood could have known
it was thallium.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.781
- Not unless he did it.
- It doesn't make sense.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.451
You work your entire career,
build a perfect record,

20:01.576 --> 20:04.746
ascend to the position of deputy director,
and then throw it all away?

20:04.871 --> 20:07.123
Nassar boasted about killing
nearly a thousand people.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.292
Atwood knew most of them. We all did.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.337
We saw people after 9/11 who wouldn't
hurt a fly screaming for blood.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.505
- Tragedy changes people.
- I understand all that.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.174
It just doesn't feel right.

20:16.299 --> 20:19.177
I want someone to reach out
to some of Atwood's closest colleagues.

20:19.302 --> 20:22.013
Inquire into his state of mind. See if
there's something we're not being told.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.182
I'll see who's closest to Atwood
at the bureau, arrange a meeting.

20:24.307 --> 20:25.183
Okay, let's do it.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.143
Sir, they need you in the COC.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.312
They found a suspect in the ricin case.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.815
Walter Lynch, 44 years of age.
Worked as a truck driver.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.651
Currently on state disability insurance.

20:34.776 --> 20:37.946
ATF and FBI apprehended him
at his home outside Scotts Bluff.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.198
In his home, we found evidence
of ricin production

20:40.323 --> 20:42.825
and a list of polling stations
across the country.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.369
Most are on his former delivery routes.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.871
We've notified the authorities
at these locations to verify their safety.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.289
Do we have a motive?

20:48.414 --> 20:51.793
Lynch had posted multiple anti-government
messages on social media.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.545
His attack on the polls appears to be
consistent with his views.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.965
Sir, I think we should make
an announcement right away.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.842
The public should know
that the suspect's in custody,

20:59.968 --> 21:02.679
there's no link to Nassar,
and it's safe to go to the polls.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.722
I'm afraid we can't do that just yet, sir.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.224
A search of Lynch's Web activity

21:06.349 --> 21:08.726
shows he's affiliated with a domestic
anti-government militia

21:08.851 --> 21:10.228
known as the Liberty Defenders.

21:10.353 --> 21:13.022
16 confirmed cells
throughout the West and Southwest.

21:13.147 --> 21:15.692
Lynch urged other members
to spread ricin at polls

21:15.817 --> 21:17.068
in their respective states.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.695
So you're saying the threat
is not contained.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.863
Our field officers
need more time to be certain.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.032
- How much more time?
- Worst-case scenario,

21:23.157 --> 21:24.993
72 hours to clear
all the militia members.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.287
The election is tomorrow.

21:29.831 --> 21:34.168
We can't say with absolute certainty
that the polling stations will be safe.

21:38.172 --> 21:41.592
Mr. President,
I have unfortunate news.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.761
One of the poll workers, Mindy Hesser--

21:43.886 --> 21:46.389
- The schoolteacher.
- She just died, sir.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.063
Thank you, everyone. Excuse me.

21:56.858 --> 21:58.151
Jared.

21:58.860 --> 21:59.944
Thanks for coming. Seth Wright.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.279
Yeah, I know.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.364
Never been invited
to the White House.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.949
It's pretty cool, isn't it?

22:05.074 --> 22:08.661
- I've dreamed of this place.
- Have a seat.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.289
I'm glad you like it,

22:11.414 --> 22:14.292
because if you ever sandbag
the president's teenage son again,

22:14.417 --> 22:15.918
consider yourself banned for life.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.712
Whoa! Easy!

22:17.837 --> 22:20.131
I was just doing my job.

22:20.256 --> 22:23.384
But if you want the story gone, it's gone.
It wasn't even mine to begin with.

22:23.509 --> 22:26.471
I know. Lisa Jordan killed the story,
and then your editor slipped it onto you.

22:26.596 --> 22:29.390
- Trust me, he's next on my invite list.
- What are you talking about?

22:29.515 --> 22:31.059
Lisa gave me the tip, not my editor.

22:31.184 --> 22:32.310
- Lisa?
- Yeah.

22:32.435 --> 22:35.396
She said she couldn't run with it
herself, but thought that someone should.

22:35.521 --> 22:36.606
Look...

22:37.106 --> 22:39.150
I know we didn't get off
on the right foot,

22:39.275 --> 22:40.902
but since I'm already here,

22:41.027 --> 22:43.821
do you think you could show me
the bowling alley Truman built?

22:43.946 --> 22:45.531
Get out of here, Jared.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.669
Hey. Where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.129
Find Atwood?

23:00.254 --> 23:02.173
No. Hang on. We'll talk in a minute.

23:02.298 --> 23:03.466
Agent Wells.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.843
Yes, this is Aaron Shore,
President Kirkman's Chief of Staff.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.845
How can I help you, Mr. Shore?

23:07.970 --> 23:10.014
<i>I was wondering if you could stop
by the White House</i>

23:10.139 --> 23:12.642
to discuss a highly confidential,
urgent matter.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.143
May I ask what this is regarding?

23:15.311 --> 23:17.146
The death of Majid Nassar.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.324
No guarantees here.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.493
We can't risk any more innocent lives.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.870
Yes, sir, but canceling the election?

23:32.995 --> 23:35.123
Sir, without a Congress,
we can't meet budget deadlines

23:35.248 --> 23:36.541
or raise a debt ceiling.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.835
- The economy--
- Takes second place to a body count.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.212
Even if we postpone the election,
there's no guarantee there won't be

23:41.337 --> 23:44.215
another threat or attack. At some point,
we're just gonna have to take a chance.

23:44.340 --> 23:47.051
And what if more lives are lost
at the polls tomorrow?

23:47.176 --> 23:49.637
It takes one person
to poison a polling station.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.181
Thousands of people could be infected.

23:53.683 --> 23:55.685
I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

23:55.810 --> 23:58.521
Seth, gather the press.
I'll make the announcement myself.

23:58.646 --> 24:01.899
- Your first press conference.
- Not exactly how I pictured it.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.526
Sir, in the history of the Republic,

24:03.651 --> 24:05.486
federal elections
have never been canceled,

24:05.611 --> 24:07.905
not by weather, war,
or threat of an attack.

24:08.030 --> 24:10.241
Unfortunately,
we're living in a time of firsts.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.205
- Could I have a moment, please?
- Sir.

24:18.791 --> 24:19.917
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.335
Um...

24:22.462 --> 24:24.755
the results came in.

24:24.881 --> 24:28.384
Leo's waiting.
He wants to talk to you alone.

24:30.470 --> 24:31.721
Did you look at them?

24:31.846 --> 24:32.972
No, I...

24:36.225 --> 24:37.935
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose him.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.979
Don't. Stop it.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.614
<i>- Not after 9/11.
- There's no data</i>

24:49.739 --> 24:52.116
<i>to predict voter turnout this election.
In the history...</i>

24:52.241 --> 24:53.451
You haven't opened it.

24:53.576 --> 24:54.827
No.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.247
I don't need to.

24:59.248 --> 25:02.710
I don't need a lab or genetics
to tell me what I already know.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.629
What I've always known,

25:04.754 --> 25:07.882
from the day you were born
and every day since.

25:08.424 --> 25:13.137
Whatever it says in here
isn't gonna change anything.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.264
At least not for me.

25:15.389 --> 25:18.434
Leo, you will always be my son.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.520
And I will always be your father.

25:21.270 --> 25:24.148
The only reason why I never
talked to you about this before,

25:24.273 --> 25:27.235
honestly, is because
it didn't matter to me.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.113
But I never thought
about how it might matter to you,

25:32.031 --> 25:33.449
and for that, I was wrong.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.910
And I'm sorry.

25:36.786 --> 25:38.120
So, this...

25:39.038 --> 25:41.832
is for you, to open or not.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.919
And whatever you choose to do,
I will respect.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.631
But, Leo, I need you to know
how much I love you.

25:54.929 --> 25:56.305
I should finish my homework.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.642
Yeah.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.986
<i>How else do you plan
to stand up to terrorists?</i>

26:10.111 --> 26:11.821
<i>Wouldn't it be better
to postpone the election</i>

26:11.946 --> 26:13.656
<i>until polls can be properly secured?</i>

26:13.781 --> 26:15.783
<i>That way, we're not risking the lives</i>

26:15.908 --> 26:17.493
<i>of the poll workers and the voters.</i>

26:17.618 --> 26:19.704
<i>We're now getting word
we're going to go live now</i>

26:19.829 --> 26:21.539
<i>to the woman whose mother,
Mindy Hesser,</i>

26:21.664 --> 26:23.958
<i>was the first victim
of the ricin poisoning.</i>

26:24.083 --> 26:26.043
<i>My mother volunteered at the polls</i>

26:26.168 --> 26:29.171
<i>because she thought everyone
deserved to have a voice.</i>

26:30.298 --> 26:34.302
<i>She said so many people
sacrificed their lives for that ideal.</i>

26:34.427 --> 26:37.638
<i>The least she could do
was help elections run smoothly.</i>

26:37.763 --> 26:39.849
<i>That's the kind
of person she was.</i>

26:40.766 --> 26:43.060
<i>I wish more of us were like her.</i>

26:43.185 --> 26:44.312
<i>Sorry.</i>

26:45.771 --> 26:49.025
- Should just be a couple more minutes.
- That's what you said 45 minutes ago.

26:49.150 --> 26:52.153
Yes, Natalie. I'll say it again
in another 45 if he's not here.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.697
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

26:54.822 --> 26:56.198
- Thank you, Seth.
- Thank you, sir.

26:56.324 --> 26:58.409
Please, be seated. Good afternoon.

26:58.534 --> 26:59.660
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

26:59.785 --> 27:03.372
As you already know, some of our polling
stations in the Kansas City area

27:03.497 --> 27:06.042
have been the subject
of a bioterrorism attack.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.919
And even though our federal,
state and local law officials

27:09.045 --> 27:11.756
are assuring us that the polling stations
will be safe,

27:11.881 --> 27:15.259
understandably,
many Americans are still scared.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.054
Tragically, one of our volunteer
poll workers

27:18.179 --> 27:20.890
lost their life during the attack.
Her name was Mindy Hesser.

27:21.015 --> 27:22.850
And as many of our poll workers

27:22.975 --> 27:25.394
have declined to volunteer
this election cycle

27:25.519 --> 27:28.731
for fear of further attacks,
Mindy showed up.

27:28.856 --> 27:32.109
She set up her table,
updated her voting rolls,

27:32.234 --> 27:35.029
as she has for nearly 23 years.

27:35.488 --> 27:39.450
Moments ago, I had the honor
of talking to Mindy's daughter,

27:39.575 --> 27:43.120
and she told me
that no fear or uncertainty

27:43.245 --> 27:46.207
would ever have prevented her mother
from carrying out what she considered

27:46.332 --> 27:51.420
to be her most important civic duty,
protecting our right to vote.

27:53.047 --> 27:56.926
Many of my colleagues have advised me
to cancel these elections.

27:58.719 --> 28:01.430
But I have been inspired
by Mindy's actions.

28:01.555 --> 28:04.934
So I have decided that these elections
will go forward as planned.

28:07.395 --> 28:11.148
Tomorrow morning,
I myself will go to the polls

28:11.273 --> 28:15.319
alongside my fellow Americans,
and I will cast my ballot.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.656
I believe we owe it to Mindy
and to every other American

28:18.781 --> 28:22.618
that has given their life
to protect our great democracy.

28:23.119 --> 28:25.287
We cannot live in fear.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.457
We will not live in fear.

28:32.044 --> 28:36.215
Thank you, and God bless America.

28:41.095 --> 28:43.514
Congratulations, sir. I understand
the election will go on as planned.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.516
- It was the right move, sir.
- Thank you.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.643
Unfortunately, that is not
why I asked you both here.

28:47.768 --> 28:49.979
Earlier today,
at approximately 10:00 a.m.,

28:50.104 --> 28:53.899
Jason Atwood confessed
to the killing of Majid Nassar.

28:54.316 --> 28:56.777
Wait, I'm sorry.
The deputy director of the FBI

28:56.902 --> 28:58.529
killed the world's
most wanted terrorist?

28:58.654 --> 29:00.030
I'm afraid so.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.867
During his confession to me,
he stated that he did not believe

29:02.992 --> 29:05.661
that Nassar was gonna provide us
with any useful information

29:05.786 --> 29:08.372
and that on behalf of our fallen
at the Capitol Building,

29:08.497 --> 29:11.208
he felt it his patriotic duty
to take Nassar's life.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.127
His patriotic duty?

29:13.252 --> 29:15.671
It's murder, and a catastrophic failure
of national security.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.131
I know, I know.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.008
And I have every intention
of investigating it,

29:19.133 --> 29:20.634
but right now,
the case is strictly classified

29:20.760 --> 29:23.387
and under the jurisdiction
of Army CIC and the FBI.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.139
I have asked Aaron Shore

29:25.264 --> 29:27.558
to interview some
of Atwood's closest colleagues.

29:27.683 --> 29:29.727
Hopefully we can find out something more.

29:29.852 --> 29:31.645
Well, tomorrow's election
gives us a Congress.

29:31.771 --> 29:34.064
Then I can open up an independent
investigation to assist you.

29:34.190 --> 29:38.068
I'm not sure if the first act of our new
Congress should be this investigation.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.946
Surely there are more pressing issues
that we need to get on with.

29:43.657 --> 29:46.243
No, Peter, I think
the congresswoman is right.

29:46.368 --> 29:50.206
Our first priority should be
gaining the nation's trust.

29:50.331 --> 29:52.166
Kimble, thank you.

29:53.542 --> 29:54.710
Seth?

29:56.712 --> 29:58.005
Great speech by the president.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.381
You did a final polish, right?

29:59.507 --> 30:01.550
You know, we had a deal,
and you broke it.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.929
Next time you try to be a Woodward, pick
a better Bernstein than Jared Abbott.

30:05.054 --> 30:07.598
Look, to be fair, all I said

30:07.723 --> 30:09.934
was that I wouldn't run
with the story, and I didn't.

30:10.059 --> 30:13.062
- No, you just gave it to somebody else.
- Seth, come on.

30:13.187 --> 30:14.855
Like it or not, it is news.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.732
Maybe not to you,
but to millions of Americans

30:16.857 --> 30:18.400
about to cast their votes tomorrow,

30:18.526 --> 30:22.196
the president's relationship
with the truth means something.

30:23.197 --> 30:24.615
I like you.

30:24.740 --> 30:27.284
Seth, I really do.

30:27.409 --> 30:30.412
But asking me to choose
between you and the truth

30:30.538 --> 30:33.749
will produce an outcome
that won't make either of us happy.

30:51.433 --> 30:53.936
Thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.189
How can I help you?

30:57.940 --> 31:01.235
There's no easy way to say this,
but earlier today,

31:01.777 --> 31:04.238
Director Atwood
met with the president,

31:04.363 --> 31:06.991
and he confessed
to assassinating Majid Nassar.

31:07.116 --> 31:08.993
Now, he claims to have used thallium...

31:09.118 --> 31:10.160
- No.
- ...to poison Nassar.

31:10.286 --> 31:11.787
That's not possible.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.124
This is a shock to everyone,

31:15.249 --> 31:17.084
which is why I wanted
to speak with you,

31:17.209 --> 31:21.171
to see if you've noticed anything
out of the ordinary, recent life changes.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.340
Has he said anything unusual?

31:23.465 --> 31:25.634
Anything suspicious in the past week?

31:27.303 --> 31:29.054
Agent Wells?

31:31.265 --> 31:32.349
Sorry. I...

31:32.474 --> 31:35.686
I can understand this is overwhelming,
but can you think of anything

31:35.811 --> 31:38.772
that might help us understand
Atwood's murder of Nassar?

31:40.399 --> 31:41.483
No.

31:43.319 --> 31:45.154
- May I see him?
- I'm sorry, Agent Wells,

31:45.279 --> 31:48.490
but he is being held
in a maximum-security facility.

31:48.991 --> 31:51.076
He's not allowed any visitors.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.204
Chuck, tell me you can trace that text.

31:54.330 --> 31:55.873
You know, there's only
a handful of people

31:55.998 --> 31:57.958
in the global intelligence community
capable of tracing a text.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.710
<i>- And you're one of them, right?</i>
- No.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.378
But luckily, I know someone
with the Mossad

32:01.503 --> 32:03.964
- who passed me an encryption key.
- So you can get a location?

32:04.506 --> 32:06.342
It's not that easy.

32:13.515 --> 32:15.476
Instead, you'll have
to settle for a phone number.

32:17.186 --> 32:19.063
<i>In a bid
to encourage voter turnout,</i>

32:19.188 --> 32:22.691
<i>President Kirkman will cast his vote
at the polls tomorrow.</i>

32:22.816 --> 32:24.735
Secret Service is gonna let him go?

32:24.860 --> 32:26.654
Thought you guys
were supposed to protect him.

32:26.779 --> 32:30.366
<i>- ...Kirkman being naive to think...</i>
- Parents get their own ideas.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.035
<i>As the country
prepares for election day,</i>

32:33.160 --> 32:35.079
<i>the question that seems to be
on everyone's mind...</i>

32:35.204 --> 32:38.248
You know, my-- my dad's
called me every day

32:38.374 --> 32:40.501
since I joined the Secret Service

32:40.626 --> 32:42.753
just to make sure I'm staying safe.

32:42.878 --> 32:44.380
Mike, I...

32:44.713 --> 32:46.090
I know what you're doing.

32:46.215 --> 32:49.343
You're trying to tell me,
no matter what, my dad cares.

32:49.677 --> 32:51.720
No, I'm telling you about my dad.

32:53.347 --> 32:57.142
Taught me how to hoop
and how to talk to girls.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.563
He pretty much made me
who I am today.

33:01.689 --> 33:05.818
The funny thing is,
I didn't know him till I was three.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.906
That's when my mom married him.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.867
I never met my biological father.

33:16.745 --> 33:20.374
Those tests...
They tell you biology.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.168
But they don't tell you who your dad is.

33:25.379 --> 33:27.756
Don't stay up too late watching the news.

33:28.424 --> 33:30.384
Can't always trust what you see.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.902
<i>It's Wednesday, February 7th,</i>

33:49.028 --> 33:52.072
<i>the day the president
and our nation have been waiting for.</i>

33:52.197 --> 33:54.450
<i>Beginning at 6:30 a.m. in the East,</i>

33:54.575 --> 33:56.493
<i>polls across the country will be open.</i>

33:56.618 --> 33:58.996
<i>- The question on everyone's mind...</i>
- Hey.

33:59.121 --> 34:02.958
<i>...are voters going to show up?
Local police and fire departments,</i>

34:03.083 --> 34:04.835
<i>- even the National Guard...</i>
- You look beautiful.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.503
<i>...have been stationed
at polling stations</i>

34:06.628 --> 34:08.922
<i>across the country, ready to respond...</i>

34:18.806 --> 34:21.018
Have you spoken to Leo?

34:21.143 --> 34:22.936
No, not a word.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.981
I don't even know
if he's opened the test results yet.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.484
- You?
- No.

34:28.609 --> 34:30.444
He won't speak to me either.

34:33.237 --> 34:37.618
When I was taking the oath of office,
the only thing I was honestly scared about

34:37.743 --> 34:40.829
was what this could possibly do
to our family.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.335
I could never have seen this one coming.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.338
Well, whatever he decides,

34:49.838 --> 34:53.509
we've realized our new house
can't hold any secrets.

34:54.676 --> 34:55.844
Yeah.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.271
Clear.

35:32.881 --> 35:34.383
Maybe it'll pick up later.

35:34.508 --> 35:36.510
Yeah, you want to put money on that?

35:37.302 --> 35:38.846
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.024
Tom...

35:51.567 --> 35:53.318
I know that look.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.946
Come on, talk to me.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.740
I took a vow to do everything in my power

35:58.866 --> 36:00.951
to lead this country back
after the bombing.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.953
I know we've had a few things
thrown at us,

36:03.078 --> 36:05.205
but if I can't even get
the American people to vote...

36:05.330 --> 36:07.624
You made a decision
to move forward with the elections

36:07.749 --> 36:09.459
when most would have shied away.

36:09.585 --> 36:11.587
You made a commitment
that this country needed,

36:11.712 --> 36:13.922
and now we're finally
gonna have a Congress.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.799
What kind of a Congress
is that gonna be?

36:15.924 --> 36:19.970
A House that represents 10%
of the country is no government at all.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.722
They call me an illegitimate president.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.974
They'll call it an illegitimate Congress,
and they'd be right.

36:24.099 --> 36:28.729
Tom, they saw you go to the polls.
They know that they can trust you.

36:29.271 --> 36:32.149
Don't they say that one vote
can make all the difference?

36:32.274 --> 36:33.817
You were there, also.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.986
- That's two votes.
- Yeah.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.071
Let's hope they don't cancel
each other out.

36:40.949 --> 36:43.202
- Hey.
- Leo, everything all right?

36:44.369 --> 36:46.455
I couldn't sleep last night.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.584
I don't want this in my room.

36:53.629 --> 36:56.798
- This is still sealed.
- I don't need to open it either.

36:58.383 --> 36:59.551
I know you're my dad.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.429
Come... Come here.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.805
Hey.

37:08.602 --> 37:09.895
Thank you.

37:14.399 --> 37:15.692
Wow.

37:15.817 --> 37:17.819
He's definitely my son.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.613
That's not even funny.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.823
Sir? They're waiting for you.

37:21.949 --> 37:23.659
I'm sorry. What is it?

37:27.913 --> 37:30.040
Aaron, give me a second.
I'll be right in.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.333
Yes, sir.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.061
<i>It's an unusual election
in American history.</i>

37:51.186 --> 37:53.647
<i>The ricin attack in Kansas City has sent
shock waves throughout the country.</i>

37:53.772 --> 37:56.066
- Excuse me. Thank you.
<i>- Many voters are afraid to vote.</i>

37:56.191 --> 37:59.736
<i>But what was threatening to be a
light turnout is not so light after all.</i>

37:59.861 --> 38:03.198
<i>Voters are lining up at the polling
booths to make sure their votes</i>

38:03.323 --> 38:05.534
<i>are counted. When asked why they decided
to come out today,</i>

38:05.659 --> 38:08.537
<i>the majority said, "Because
President Kirkman went to vote."</i>

38:08.662 --> 38:10.372
They're voting, Mr. President.

38:10.497 --> 38:12.165
They won't have complete returns
until later,

38:12.291 --> 38:14.418
but they're already calling it
a victory... for democracy.

38:14.543 --> 38:15.877
Thank you, Seth.

38:16.003 --> 38:17.754
Also, got a heads-up from DHS.

38:17.879 --> 38:20.757
The joint task force followed through
with the remaining militia members.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.718
They concluded there's no more ricin.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.886
Lynch was acting alone.

38:25.387 --> 38:26.930
Tomorrow, you'll have a Congress.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.390
A new government.

38:28.515 --> 38:30.934
We'll still need a Cabinet and a
vice president, but we're working on it.

38:31.059 --> 38:32.894
We'll get there, Aaron.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.189
Any word on Atwood?

38:36.315 --> 38:37.691
I spoke to Agent Wells.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.110
She said nothing
to dispel his confessions.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.403
Okay.

38:43.071 --> 38:44.948
Seth?

38:45.073 --> 38:47.534
There's something
I need you to do for me.

38:51.204 --> 38:53.582
Mr. President, Lisa Jordan.

38:55.417 --> 38:58.837
I know you've been asking questions
about me and my son.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.299
I have your answer.

39:02.424 --> 39:03.925
A definitive one.

39:04.885 --> 39:06.470
A DNA test.

39:06.595 --> 39:09.264
Margin of error,.01%.

39:09.389 --> 39:12.476
About as certain
as you're gonna find in this world.

39:12.601 --> 39:15.312
I am Leo's biological father.

39:15.437 --> 39:17.647
I can't imagine
it's much of a story anymore,

39:17.773 --> 39:19.483
but I wanted you to know the truth.

39:19.608 --> 39:21.276
Thank you, Mr. President.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.821
I assume I should hand these
back to my editor.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.114
Not on my account.

39:26.239 --> 39:29.117
I believe our country is only as strong
as our journalists.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.953
I expect you to keep us honest.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.997
Ms. Jordan.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.124
- Thank you, Seth.
- Good night, sir.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.169
So I guess we'll still be
working together.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.296
Yes, but only working.

39:41.755 --> 39:44.299
I trusted you.
You took advantage of it.

39:48.804 --> 39:51.473
Thank you, Mr. Press Secretary.

39:51.598 --> 39:53.600
Thank you, Ms. Jordan.

40:02.984 --> 40:03.944
<i>Hello?</i>

40:04.069 --> 40:05.987
Last time we spoke, I found Room 105,

40:06.113 --> 40:08.990
and now the only person I trust
is behind bars.

40:09.783 --> 40:11.201
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

40:11.326 --> 40:13.703
I'm done talking
to an anonymous voice over the phone.

40:13.829 --> 40:15.872
You have something to say to me, meet me.

40:15.997 --> 40:18.333
<i>- 11:14 p.m.</i>
- Where?

40:19.126 --> 40:21.169
<i>I don't intend to meet you, ever.</i>

40:21.294 --> 40:23.797
<i>11:14 p.m. Look into it.</i>

40:23.922 --> 40:25.006
Wait.

40:32.681 --> 40:34.850
- Don't you look happy.
- Well, it's a good day.

40:34.975 --> 40:37.227
The president is getting his Congress...

40:37.352 --> 40:39.062
which is why I'm here.

40:39.187 --> 40:40.397
I wanted to let you know

40:40.522 --> 40:42.482
that if you do go ahead
with an investigation,

40:42.607 --> 40:44.234
it'll be without my support.

40:44.359 --> 40:46.403
I admire your loyalty, Peter.

40:46.528 --> 40:49.156
I just don't understand it.

40:49.281 --> 40:51.741
We both know Kirkman
can't get out of his own way.

40:51.867 --> 40:54.703
Whether it's his lack of experience

40:54.828 --> 40:56.204
or the times we're in...

40:56.329 --> 40:58.165
he won't last.

40:59.875 --> 41:02.419
Unless that's what you're counting on.

41:02.544 --> 41:06.256
That when he goes down,
assuming you make it to V.P.,

41:06.381 --> 41:09.301
you would be the last man standing.

41:10.051 --> 41:12.387
It's a brilliant path to the White House.

41:12.512 --> 41:15.390
I just can't believe
I didn't see it until now.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.227
You got an overactive imagination, Kimble.

41:19.352 --> 41:20.896
I don't think so.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.566
But when I take him down,

41:24.691 --> 41:26.902
I'll make sure I don't leave you behind.

41:31.198 --> 41:32.407
Good night, Kimble.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.584
You're late.

41:46.671 --> 41:48.590
Atwood managed to tie up
a loose end for us today.

41:48.715 --> 41:50.383
I heard.

41:50.509 --> 41:52.135
I want you to stay on top of any fallout,

41:52.260 --> 41:54.638
any further investigation
into Nassar's murder.

41:54.763 --> 41:56.681
Fine.

41:57.933 --> 41:59.434
Cheer up, Peter.

41:59.935 --> 42:01.478
You're about to be a heartbeat away.

42:01.603 --> 42:05.565
And how many more good people need
to be destroyed before that happens?

42:05.690 --> 42:07.150
Just one.
