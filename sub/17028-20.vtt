WEBVTT

00:02.675 --> 00:03.842
Table for two.

00:03.843 --> 00:06.078
And don't worry, he just went.

00:06.079 --> 00:09.247
So did the guy at booth three.

00:11.350 --> 00:13.452
Max, that cop has a drug-sniffing dog.

00:13.453 --> 00:17.056
So, it was nice knowing you.

00:18.858 --> 00:20.592
What's that, now?

00:20.593 --> 00:23.095
- You're moving out?
- Max, put that away!

00:23.096 --> 00:27.633
It smells like Willie Nelson's
bandana drawer in here.

00:27.634 --> 00:31.136
Max, have you seen the olicepay ogday?

00:31.137 --> 00:33.238
Uh, that pot was too strong.

00:33.239 --> 00:35.541
There's a chipmunk talking to me.

00:35.542 --> 00:37.109
Heavens, that's a drug-sniffing dog!

00:37.110 --> 00:40.746
Earl will spend the rest
of his life behind bars.

00:40.747 --> 00:43.983
So, like, two weeks?

00:43.984 --> 00:46.585
Earl, heads up. Narc dog at 1:00.

00:46.586 --> 00:48.287
Or it might be 6:00.

00:48.288 --> 00:51.290
But it's definitely 420.

00:51.291 --> 00:53.425
So, she can bring that dog in here,

00:53.426 --> 00:57.796
but I can't bring my
emotional support hooker.

00:57.797 --> 01:00.599
I can't watch a dog tear Earl to pieces.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.302
Hey there, fella. Sit.

01:03.303 --> 01:05.069
All right, now give me that paw.

01:05.071 --> 01:08.106
Now here's what I got
for you. There you go.

01:11.677 --> 01:13.579
I have a way with dogs.

01:13.580 --> 01:15.681
Well, my marijuana biscuits do.

01:15.682 --> 01:18.017
That's why I call them Hush Puppies.

01:18.018 --> 01:19.852
Hey, Han, if it's cool, me and the dog

01:19.853 --> 01:22.988
are gonna go see the
new Star Wars movie.

01:41.203 --> 01:44.006
Max, guess what Bobby and
I are doing tomorrow night?

01:44.007 --> 01:45.941
Where have I been dying to go?

01:45.942 --> 01:48.777
Besides a doctor's office
that's not in a Chipotle.

01:48.778 --> 01:52.814
Sorry, Dr. Pizza Hut has a waiting list.

01:54.717 --> 01:56.484
Hey, everybody!

01:59.421 --> 02:03.425
Oh, I'm worried that
Barbara's not smart.

02:03.426 --> 02:05.728
Yeah, she doesn't
even return my e-mails.

02:05.729 --> 02:08.797
I think she has Oleg's DNA.

02:08.798 --> 02:11.700
So do most of the chairs in here.

02:11.701 --> 02:14.603
That's why I bring my
chair from home every day.

02:14.604 --> 02:16.893
I mean, it's awkward on the subway,

02:16.894 --> 02:20.497
but I don't wanna sit
on those seats either.

02:20.498 --> 02:22.733
Sophie, don't blame me.
My family's very smart.

02:22.734 --> 02:24.701
We won Family Feud in Ukraine,

02:24.702 --> 02:28.372
and it takes intelligence
to kill another family.

02:28.373 --> 02:29.740
Who are we kidding?

02:29.741 --> 02:33.510
You're a gorgeous moron.

02:33.511 --> 02:35.779
But what are we gonna
do with a dumb baby?

02:35.780 --> 02:37.714
Maybe we should ask Han.

02:37.715 --> 02:40.183
He's a dumb baby.

02:40.184 --> 02:42.419
Hey, don't call Han a dumb baby.

02:42.420 --> 02:44.020
He managed to pull that stupid vest

02:44.021 --> 02:47.224
over his giant potato
head all by himself.

02:47.225 --> 02:51.395
Nope. I had to help him.

02:51.396 --> 02:53.630
Starting to think the
Splenda packet I came out for

02:53.631 --> 02:56.533
wasn't worth it.

02:56.534 --> 03:00.871
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hello, yourself, beautiful.

03:00.872 --> 03:03.540
Bobby, great news... guess
what we're doing tomorrow night?

03:03.541 --> 03:05.609
Tomorrow night? I can't.

03:05.610 --> 03:07.911
I have a hobby that I
haven't told you about

03:07.912 --> 03:10.647
because I don't think
it's something you'll like.

03:10.648 --> 03:15.285
Oh, so is your hobby getting
to the point of a story quickly?

03:15.286 --> 03:16.887
It's definitely not acknowledging

03:16.888 --> 03:19.990
my new Caesar salad recipe.

03:19.991 --> 03:20.957
Still waiting.

03:20.958 --> 03:23.160
Still nauseous.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.963
Well, I bet you Bobby's
into doing dead people.

03:26.964 --> 03:30.100
Yeah, he just has that look.

03:30.101 --> 03:31.802
Bobby, for the love
of God, just tell me.

03:31.803 --> 03:34.404
Whatever hobby you have,
it can't be worse than that.

03:34.405 --> 03:37.340
Fine, Caroline, I'm just
gonna come out and say it.

03:37.341 --> 03:39.810
I like to bowl.

03:39.811 --> 03:41.074
And you're sure you don't wanna

03:41.075 --> 03:42.646
go with the dead people thing?

03:42.647 --> 03:44.143
But bowling's just a hobby, right?

03:44.144 --> 03:45.148
Something you only do...

03:45.149 --> 03:46.783
Every Tuesday night.

03:46.784 --> 03:49.252
I'm on a team. I have
a locker at the alley.

03:49.253 --> 03:51.822
And that tattoo I told you was the moon,

03:51.823 --> 03:53.523
it's a bowling ball.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.991
Why didn't you tell me?

03:54.992 --> 03:57.661
We don't talk about me a lot.

03:57.662 --> 03:59.296
I thought it would be more important

03:59.297 --> 04:01.665
to tell you about my nut
allergy when I had the floor.

04:01.666 --> 04:03.934
You have a nut allergy?

04:03.935 --> 04:07.370
Bowler? Nice!

04:07.371 --> 04:09.206
I was on a bowling team in juvie.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.274
We were called The Girls Who Escaped

04:11.275 --> 04:13.710
when the Guards Took
Us to the Bowling Alley.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.178
That'd be hard to put on a shirt.

04:15.179 --> 04:17.981
Oh, we didn't wear shirts.

04:17.982 --> 04:20.382
Caroline, I knew bowling
wouldn't be your thing.

04:20.384 --> 04:23.620
You don't pronounce any
of the Ns in Au Bon Pain.

04:23.621 --> 04:26.223
That's because it's Au Bon Pain.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.525
We can have separate things.

04:28.526 --> 04:30.861
Bobby, you know what? Part
of being in a relationship

04:30.862 --> 04:33.864
is being open to trying new things.

04:33.865 --> 04:38.134
And since I'm not ready
to try being on top yet,

04:38.135 --> 04:40.136
I'm gonna come watch you bowl tomorrow.

04:40.137 --> 04:42.005
Really? Okay, great.

04:42.006 --> 04:43.540
Hey, Max, you wanna come too?

04:43.541 --> 04:45.542
Got some cute guys on my bowling team.

04:45.543 --> 04:47.344
Well, just some guys
that aren't that fat.

04:47.345 --> 04:48.845
It's a bowling team.

04:48.846 --> 04:52.249
Beer-based recreation? Men with curves?

04:52.250 --> 04:55.451
Are we going to a
bowling alley or heaven?

04:58.088 --> 05:01.223
Max, I'm ready to go bowling.

05:02.726 --> 05:04.661
You look like you're ready for a greaser

05:04.662 --> 05:07.230
to feel you up at Make Out Point.

05:07.231 --> 05:09.165
I've waited long enough
to have a boyfriend.

05:09.166 --> 05:10.834
I can learn to like anything.

05:10.835 --> 05:12.402
I mean, it's not like it's bowling.

05:12.403 --> 05:15.071
Oh, my God, it's bowling!

05:15.072 --> 05:17.073
Well, I loved it.

05:17.074 --> 05:20.243
But I hung up my back
brace after I bowled a 300.

05:20.244 --> 05:23.079
I wanted to go out on
top, like Rob Schneider.

05:24.715 --> 05:28.150
And from what I hear,
apparently not you.

05:29.886 --> 05:31.888
Hi, girls.

05:31.889 --> 05:35.125
Yeah, Barbara's even
dumber than I thought.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.894
Yeah, she had a play date
with the baby next door.

05:37.895 --> 05:40.797
And he can read.

05:40.798 --> 05:41.965
Jimmy?

05:41.966 --> 05:44.467
He's 37.

05:44.468 --> 05:46.603
He's a little person.

05:46.604 --> 05:49.072
And a tax attorney.

05:49.073 --> 05:53.877
Well, I did think it was
odd that he lived alone.

05:53.878 --> 05:55.712
We're taking Barbara bowling.

05:55.713 --> 05:57.714
Between the flashing
lights and the fist fights,

05:57.715 --> 05:59.716
nothing's more stimulating
for a baby's brain

05:59.717 --> 06:01.651
than a bowling alley.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.320
How about a book?

06:03.321 --> 06:05.354
On bowling?

06:10.160 --> 06:12.963
So, this is a bowling alley.

06:12.964 --> 06:14.947
This actually isn't so bad.

06:14.948 --> 06:16.566
What was that?

06:16.567 --> 06:19.603
The sound of people going nowhere.

06:19.604 --> 06:21.237
Hey!

06:21.238 --> 06:24.240
If you're here for the sock
hop, it was 40 years ago.

06:24.241 --> 06:25.842
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You look sexy.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.078
Thank you. I'm here to support you

06:28.079 --> 06:29.646
because this is what you love.

06:29.647 --> 06:31.590
And what you love, I love.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.483
That seriously has to stop.

06:33.484 --> 06:35.619
Hey, this is Frank. He's
the star of our team.

06:35.620 --> 06:36.883
Tell 'em about yourself, Frank.

06:36.884 --> 06:39.155
Well, I'm the star of our team.

06:39.156 --> 06:40.523
I also enjoy dinner.

06:40.524 --> 06:43.426
Yes! Cute and dumb.

06:43.427 --> 06:45.095
Where have you been all my life?

06:45.096 --> 06:48.098
Well, I was in high
school for ten years.

06:48.099 --> 06:49.882
All right, let's bowl.

06:49.883 --> 06:51.601
Whoo!

06:51.602 --> 06:55.037
We're going towards the sound?

06:58.675 --> 07:02.345
Wow. A curtain on the sex booth?

07:02.346 --> 07:04.848
Classy place. They had the same thing

07:04.849 --> 07:07.217
on the sex booth where we voted.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.185
You mean tried to vote.

07:09.186 --> 07:11.321
I mean, I barely started
pulling your lever

07:11.322 --> 07:13.723
before they kicked us out.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.159
Barbara, Barbara, what do you think?

07:16.160 --> 07:19.029
You feel smarter yet?

07:19.030 --> 07:21.031
You know what? This
baby's harder to read

07:21.032 --> 07:25.702
than Chelsea Handler's memoir.

07:25.703 --> 07:29.472
Oh, look, Oleg. She
likes the claw machine.

07:29.473 --> 07:31.574
This is the first thing
she's been interested in

07:31.575 --> 07:34.878
since she saw that lady fall
down the stairs in our building.

07:34.879 --> 07:37.313
That was hilarious.

07:37.314 --> 07:40.917
She was carrying a casserole bowl.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.752
You know, I am gonna
win her a stuffed animal

07:42.753 --> 07:45.188
and show her we may not be geniuses,

07:45.189 --> 07:49.192
but damn it, we can operate tiny cranes.

07:49.193 --> 07:51.693
Now what's this knobby thing do?

07:53.530 --> 07:56.166
So this is the rest of
our team. Bernie, Lynette,

07:56.167 --> 07:58.068
there's Frank again,
who's currently trying

07:58.069 --> 08:01.171
to drink a Sprite
through a wrapped straw.

08:01.172 --> 08:04.507
So cute how he doesn't know stuff.

08:04.508 --> 08:06.576
And these are the bowling
wives. No offense, Wayne.

08:06.577 --> 08:08.912
Oh, none taken. I'm a
pair of sensible earrings

08:08.913 --> 08:11.214
away from being my mother.

08:11.215 --> 08:14.084
So this is the practice for
the title game tomorrow night.

08:14.085 --> 08:17.387
We win that, we get to go to
the championships in Detroit.

08:17.388 --> 08:20.290
We win that, we get to leave Detroit.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.859
Oh, cool, I still have to pick
up my last check from Chrysler.

08:22.860 --> 08:25.061
He was my pimp.

08:25.062 --> 08:27.197
Uh, do the bowling wives
have to go to that...

08:27.198 --> 08:28.765
get to come to that?

08:28.766 --> 08:30.300
Sure, that'd be great.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.635
This could be our thing.
You could be my bowling wife.

08:33.636 --> 08:35.304
Before I say yes, is there any way

08:35.306 --> 08:37.673
the bar here serves white wine?

08:39.808 --> 08:42.645
Well, this is what couples
do for each other, right?

08:42.645 --> 08:44.447
I'm sure your spouses support you

08:44.448 --> 08:46.549
in whatever's important to you.

08:46.550 --> 08:49.786
Bernie missed my swearing in
as a Federal judge last week.

08:49.787 --> 08:52.989
But he bowled a 180, so it was worth it.

08:52.990 --> 08:56.392
Today's my birthday.
I'm one year cancer free.

08:56.393 --> 09:00.230
Lynette didn't even know I was sick.

09:00.231 --> 09:02.664
Let's go, Frank. Shake it for mama!

09:06.236 --> 09:09.271
Those ten years in high
school did nothing for him.

09:18.082 --> 09:19.749
I'm up. Good luck two-step.

09:19.750 --> 09:22.585
♪ Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm ♪

09:22.586 --> 09:26.589
Let's go, Bobby! Do a good jobby!

09:26.590 --> 09:30.927
If Frank does a good jobby,
I might just give him one.

09:30.928 --> 09:34.364
B-O-B-B-Y, I could be his alibi.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.798
'Cause he's bowling. He's bowling.

09:41.505 --> 09:43.273
Hey, hey. You wanna cut that out?

09:43.274 --> 09:45.475
We want them to lose.
If they win tomorrow,

09:45.476 --> 09:47.377
the season goes on for two more months.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.213
Haven't we already been here two months?

09:50.214 --> 09:52.881
The foot spray plays
games with your mind.

10:00.211 --> 10:02.613
Max, can you come sniff me?

10:02.614 --> 10:05.333
I was hoping the sewer
smell from our shower

10:05.334 --> 10:07.436
would cover the stink
from the bowling alley,

10:07.437 --> 10:10.673
but I think they just joined forces.

10:10.674 --> 10:13.175
If you keep smelling like
sewers and bowling alleys,

10:13.176 --> 10:15.211
we're gonna have to have sex.

10:15.212 --> 10:17.179
Well, unfortunately for you,

10:17.180 --> 10:19.382
I won't be smelling like
a bowling alley anymore

10:19.383 --> 10:21.284
because I'm gonna
tell Bobby that bowling

10:21.285 --> 10:22.685
should be his thing.

10:22.686 --> 10:25.354
And waiting for him cutely
at home will be mine.

10:25.355 --> 10:28.157
Wow. Onto something interesting,

10:28.158 --> 10:29.992
Frank came over last night.

10:29.993 --> 10:31.961
You guys had sex?

10:31.962 --> 10:34.463
I didn't hear you ring your sex bell.

10:34.464 --> 10:36.966
Well, we tried to, but
he just seemed confused

10:36.967 --> 10:38.968
so I let him go to sleep.

10:38.969 --> 10:41.137
But I did put those hands to work.

10:41.138 --> 10:44.140
I didn't hear your hand stuff buzzer.

10:44.141 --> 10:45.708
I had him work on my laces.

10:45.709 --> 10:48.578
You didn't hear my laces kazoo?

10:48.579 --> 10:50.580
Hey, Max?

10:50.581 --> 10:53.249
I got all the knots out of your shoes.

10:53.250 --> 10:56.052
If I can teach him how to have
sex and how to climb onto a bed,

10:56.053 --> 10:58.354
I'm locking this down.

10:58.355 --> 11:00.890
Hey, thought I'd surprise
you, bring you some coffee.

11:00.891 --> 11:02.692
- Oh.
- Bobby, what are you doing here?

11:02.693 --> 11:05.094
This isn't the bowling alley.

11:05.095 --> 11:07.296
Well, I'm glad I found him.
His mom was looking for him.

11:07.297 --> 11:09.601
Come on, Frank, let's go. We
gotta get ready for the game.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.334
Bye. I'll see you later at the alley.

11:11.335 --> 11:12.934
No... okay.

11:15.838 --> 11:17.173
So, can I call you?

11:17.174 --> 11:20.176
Ow!

11:20.177 --> 11:22.945
Please tell me that
wasn't his bowling hand.

11:22.946 --> 11:24.447
Caroline, what did you do to Frank?

11:24.448 --> 11:25.581
He's our best player.

11:25.582 --> 11:27.917
It was totally an accident.

11:27.918 --> 11:29.919
I support your hobby.
I was looking forward

11:29.920 --> 11:32.355
to coming tonight and
not waiting here, cutely.

11:32.356 --> 11:34.123
I'm fine.

11:34.124 --> 11:36.792
Is my pinky supposed
to be my longest finger?

11:36.793 --> 11:38.861
What are we gonna do?

11:38.862 --> 11:41.864
Well, like I told the
producers of Deadliest Catch,

11:41.865 --> 11:45.468
looks like Captain Max is
coming out of retirement.

11:45.469 --> 11:48.871
Good thing I still
have my bowling glove.

11:48.872 --> 11:51.607
Max, that's an oven mitt.

11:51.608 --> 11:53.641
That's how good I am.

11:58.914 --> 12:01.250
No pressure, but if you blow this,

12:01.251 --> 12:03.152
I may never get married.

12:03.153 --> 12:07.188
Oh, please, I once had to
bowl to get out of North Korea.

12:08.224 --> 12:10.226
Max Black, Max Black!

12:10.227 --> 12:12.728
She bowled to get her freedom back.

12:12.729 --> 12:16.298
That is a very specific cheer.

12:23.739 --> 12:25.107
Shabooya!

12:25.108 --> 12:26.909
You like that, suckers?

12:26.910 --> 12:31.347
Bowling is not just for guys
with their third DUI anymore.

12:31.348 --> 12:33.315
Max, that was amazing.

12:33.316 --> 12:36.419
The strike, I mean... what you're
doing now is very off-putting.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.754
Well, it makes more sense
if you imagine she's riding

12:38.755 --> 12:41.356
a very small unicorn named Tito.

12:42.458 --> 12:45.160
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

12:47.797 --> 12:50.199
Look at this poor sucker.

12:50.200 --> 12:53.969
I wasted $400 in quarters
yesterday on this thing.

12:53.970 --> 12:56.037
Good luck, kid.

12:58.207 --> 13:00.776
Oh. He won.

13:00.777 --> 13:04.113
Well, between Earl's claw-like hand

13:04.114 --> 13:07.950
and the fact that Han was
born in one of these machines,

13:07.951 --> 13:11.020
we've got a dream team here.

13:11.021 --> 13:14.824
Now this is our Ocean's 1 1/2.

13:14.825 --> 13:18.060
Now, you promised, if I win
Barbara the stuffed animal,

13:18.061 --> 13:20.830
you'll come to my
live action Clue party.

13:20.831 --> 13:22.832
I'll be playing Professor Plum.

13:22.833 --> 13:27.536
Re-imagined as an English
dandy with a nose for trouble.

13:27.537 --> 13:31.373
Great, and I'll play the
butler who doesn't show up.

13:31.374 --> 13:32.975
I mean, we're not going, right?

13:32.976 --> 13:35.010
No!

13:35.011 --> 13:37.012
You know I can hear you?

13:37.013 --> 13:39.047
Well, then you know we're not going.

13:40.316 --> 13:42.651
Max, Max, she's got spunk!

13:42.652 --> 13:45.554
And she's only slightly drunk.

13:45.555 --> 13:48.590
I haven't been slightly
drunk in five beers.

13:54.865 --> 13:56.599
I think we got this.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.367
Thanks for horribly maiming Frank.

13:58.368 --> 14:00.669
Two more pins and
we're going to Detroit.

14:02.739 --> 14:04.673
Waiting for my ball to drop.

14:04.674 --> 14:06.442
Story of my life.

14:06.443 --> 14:08.778
This guy knows what I'm talking about.

14:08.779 --> 14:10.846
No, I don't.

14:10.847 --> 14:12.448
Lemme get the ball for you, Max.

14:12.449 --> 14:14.683
Look, like I said to you
at that all-you-can-eat

14:14.684 --> 14:17.853
Indian buffet, unless you wanna
get bit, get out of the way.

14:17.854 --> 14:20.890
And like I said to you
at the Indian buffet,

14:20.891 --> 14:22.858
I just want to be part of this.

14:25.362 --> 14:27.196
Damn it, my fingies!

14:27.197 --> 14:28.964
Max, I'm sorry!

14:28.965 --> 14:31.734
Caroline, what did you do?

14:31.735 --> 14:33.176
You're doing more damage to the team

14:33.177 --> 14:34.800
than when we tried
to get separate checks

14:34.801 --> 14:36.438
at Macaroni Grill.

14:36.439 --> 14:39.809
Hey, if I don't drink, I don't pay.

14:39.810 --> 14:43.779
Eh, this was my pickle-snatching hand.

14:43.780 --> 14:45.714
Like I said at the Indian buffet,

14:45.715 --> 14:48.551
I think we might need an ambulance.

14:59.892 --> 15:03.997
Wow, that was the
craziest woman's room ever.

15:03.998 --> 15:08.735
It was filled with urinals and men.

15:08.736 --> 15:11.671
Wait a minute.

15:11.672 --> 15:13.773
Hey, did you get the stuffed
animal for Barbara yet?

15:13.774 --> 15:16.743
No, but something more
impressive happened.

15:16.744 --> 15:19.511
And we're still not sure how.

15:28.654 --> 15:33.593
Like I said when I was watching the OA,

15:33.594 --> 15:37.497
what the hell am I looking at?

15:37.498 --> 15:41.167
On the bright side, maybe she's
not as dumb as you thought.

15:41.168 --> 15:46.472
That claw machine is harder to
get into than my neighbor Irene.

15:46.473 --> 15:48.307
We looked away for two seconds.

15:48.308 --> 15:50.576
Some 12-year-olds
were making fun of Han,

15:50.577 --> 15:52.211
so we piled on.

15:52.212 --> 15:55.948
We gotta get her out of there.

15:55.949 --> 15:59.085
All right. I'll keep her entertained

15:59.086 --> 16:01.920
and you guys sneak up
behind her with the claw.

16:04.157 --> 16:06.526
Max, so you don't think
it's broken, do you?

16:06.527 --> 16:08.261
I know you've always wanted a hook,

16:08.262 --> 16:10.863
but I don't wanna be the cause of it.

16:10.864 --> 16:13.032
Is there any way you can use your left?

16:13.033 --> 16:16.569
Out of the question.
This one's just for show.

16:16.570 --> 16:19.539
In an emergency, someone
else can bowl for Max,

16:19.540 --> 16:20.807
but since we're mid-game,

16:20.808 --> 16:23.643
it must be someone of the same gender.

16:23.644 --> 16:26.147
I was gonna see how this worked
out before I dropped it on you.

16:26.148 --> 16:27.647
I'm also league commissioner.

16:30.149 --> 16:32.185
I'm sure one of you knows how to bowl.

16:32.186 --> 16:35.120
Not to stereotype, but look at you.

16:37.557 --> 16:39.959
Bowling wives! Bowling wives!

16:39.960 --> 16:43.162
It's time to help our bowling guys.

16:43.163 --> 16:45.631
Think we should help her, hon?

16:45.632 --> 16:47.934
That's right, we're having an affair.

16:47.935 --> 16:49.402
And no.

16:52.438 --> 16:53.840
Yeah, they won't do it.

16:53.841 --> 16:55.675
Is it too late to put Earl in a wig?

16:55.676 --> 16:58.244
Oh, that takes hours.

16:58.245 --> 17:01.781
And I don't have the glue on me.

17:01.782 --> 17:03.783
We're gonna have to forfeit.

17:03.784 --> 17:05.785
I guess I Can't Believe It's Not Gutter

17:05.786 --> 17:07.252
is going to Detroit.

17:07.253 --> 17:09.155
And I can't believe it.

17:09.156 --> 17:12.758
No. I can do the bowling.

17:12.759 --> 17:16.395
I have to because I think I'm
years away from being on top.

17:16.396 --> 17:18.731
I have vertigo.

17:18.732 --> 17:20.566
You are amazing.

17:20.567 --> 17:22.234
All you need is two pins.

17:22.236 --> 17:23.736
And even if you don't get them,

17:23.737 --> 17:25.238
I'll still love you.

17:25.239 --> 17:27.172
But please get two pins.

17:28.808 --> 17:31.177
Caroline, Caroline, she's on her own.

17:31.178 --> 17:35.047
If she doesn't get
this, she'll die alone.

17:35.048 --> 17:38.551
Max, you know how
much I hate that cheer.

17:38.552 --> 17:43.122
May I please have a practice
swoop on the court next door?

17:43.123 --> 17:45.758
Everyone else got practice swoops.

17:45.759 --> 17:47.750
Does she think rolling
the ball down the lane

17:47.751 --> 17:49.028
is called "swooping"?

17:49.029 --> 17:51.863
I don't know. She
calls sheets "bedding."

18:02.108 --> 18:06.112
Uh, gutter ball. Someone's dying alone.

18:06.113 --> 18:07.847
Oh, that was my bad.

18:07.848 --> 18:11.484
I should have told you.
Aim away from the gutters.

18:11.485 --> 18:13.986
The gutters are the things on the sides.

18:13.987 --> 18:17.423
Just... just focus on the center,

18:17.424 --> 18:20.660
whip it back, and...

18:20.661 --> 18:22.995
Or do that.

19:13.480 --> 19:14.447
Oh, my God!

19:14.448 --> 19:15.982
The ten bases fell down!

19:15.983 --> 19:17.817
I swooped them all!

19:17.818 --> 19:19.885
That was incredible.

19:19.886 --> 19:21.854
I hate to say it, but
I had this crazy thought

19:21.855 --> 19:23.856
that you were trying
to sabotage the team

19:23.857 --> 19:24.991
because you hate bowling.

19:24.992 --> 19:27.526
I thought so, too!

19:27.527 --> 19:29.427
There's someone down there.

19:32.498 --> 19:33.733
Max?

19:33.734 --> 19:34.999
You cheated!

19:37.103 --> 19:39.938
You can't pin this on me.

19:42.341 --> 19:44.910
How did Barbara get in the claw machine?

19:44.911 --> 19:47.380
Well, we've ruled out magic.

19:47.381 --> 19:50.549
Currently, our top theory
is invisible gnomes.

19:50.550 --> 19:53.686
Yeah, she may not be a genius,

19:53.687 --> 19:55.888
but she goes after what she wants.

19:55.889 --> 19:59.492
Like Oleg at Swingers Yoga.

19:59.493 --> 20:03.863
What you really had to see
was Sophie going in after her.

20:03.864 --> 20:06.032
She was face down, Spanx up.

20:06.033 --> 20:08.167
Man, it was wild.

20:08.168 --> 20:10.303
All right, we better get
going before they realize

20:10.304 --> 20:13.272
we broke their claw
machine and their sex booth

20:13.273 --> 20:15.640
and two of the condom machines.

20:18.944 --> 20:20.680
There's always next season.

20:20.681 --> 20:23.115
We'll get back at it. I
can work on some cheers.

20:23.116 --> 20:26.385
You are never coming here again.

20:26.386 --> 20:28.820
Thank you!

20:35.928 --> 20:37.829
Get a lane!

20:39.532 --> 20:41.334
Take it easy, Larry.

20:41.335 --> 20:43.569
Those are my handcuffs.

20:43.570 --> 20:45.204
One day, I'll be able to

20:45.205 --> 20:48.706
come to a bowling alley
without leaving like this.
