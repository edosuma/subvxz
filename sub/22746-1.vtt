Our quiet town of 7,000 residents holds

00:17.169 --> 00:19.869
more than a Southern manners 
and prize-winning fried 

00:19.869 --> 00:25.259
chicken recipes. 
We also hold discretion.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.970
The biggest indication of which lies in

00:27.970 --> 00:30.570
our bank's coffers and buried in our dirt.

00:30.570 --> 00:35.620
Cash - lots and lots of it. 
In our small town,

00:35.620 --> 00:38.140
we have 45 millionaires and 3

00:38.140 --> 00:42.850
billionaires. That's a rough guess. 
It all

00:42.850 --> 00:45.160
depends on how stupid or smart

00:45.160 --> 00:46.899
the generations have been with their Crown

00:46.899 --> 00:50.550
Cola stock - that's where it came from.

00:50.550 --> 00:54.670
Crown Cola. Say Pepsi or Coca Cola 

00:54.670 --> 00:56.319
in this town and you best

00:56.319 --> 01:00.489
watch your back on the way out. It was Cole

01:00.489 --> 01:03.969
Masten, Hollywood award-winning A-list

01:03.969 --> 01:06.490
actor. The man women would 
think about in the

01:06.490 --> 01:09.100
dark of the night. 
Who read a little

01:09.100 --> 01:10.900
Southern novel that no one had ever

01:10.900 --> 01:14.230
heard of and he was fascinated by it.

01:14.230 --> 01:17.050
A novel about our town. A novel that

01:17.050 --> 01:19.240
exposed the plantation homes for what

01:19.240 --> 01:22.780
they were. 
The camouflage of millionaires.

God sent his son to remind...
- What? Now?

01:49.310 --> 01:52.310
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

would be an appropriate time to thrust

02:14.069 --> 02:18.090
themselves into our lives.
- Summer,

02:18.090 --> 02:20.129
I'd imagine you're ready for your big day

02:20.129 --> 02:22.489

Hello -Hi.
- What can I do for

02:55.310 --> 02:57.740
somebody stopping by unannounced?
- Please

02:57.740 --> 02:59.090
tell me you're the owner of this

02:59.090 --> 03:06.410
fabulous estate.
- No. why? - Do you have 

03:06.410 --> 03:09.320
owner's number? 
- Oh, I can't give you the

03:09.320 --> 03:12.160
Holden's number known that you're a stranger.

03:12.160 --> 03:14.570
Why do you want? 
-I'm not really at

03:14.570 --> 03:21.470
liberty to discuss.
-Oh, well, good luck. 

03:21.470 --> 03:23.800
But, what? God.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.370
Feel free to take a seat, Mr. Payne
It is hot out.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.800
How do you know my name?
- The way you've

04:08.800 --> 04:10.360
been stomping around town? The cows in

04:10.360 --> 04:12.610
Thomas County can even know your name.
-Is that why

04:12.610 --> 04:15.460
I've been so unsuccessful? Because I'm as

04:15.460 --> 04:17.980
you so politely put it, stomping around?

04:17.980 --> 04:19.839
It’s two-fold.

04:19.839 --> 04:22.089
You’ve been stomping around town but

04:22.089 --> 04:23.800
you've not been telling people what you want.

04:23.800 --> 04:27.430
This is a private town and we don't
like strangers.

04:27.430 --> 04:29.920
I was instructed to be discreet.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.140
Were you instructed to be successful?

04:32.140 --> 04:35.940
Because you can't be both.

04:36.090 --> 04:42.370
I’m Summer. Summer Jenkins.
- Bennington Payne. My friends call me

04:42.370 --> 04:44.920
Ben and at the moment,

04:44.920 --> 04:46.180
you're looking like the 
only friend I have around

04:46.180 --> 04:49.420
Here.
- Lets not label this relationship just yet.

04:49.420 --> 04:55.870
Now, what do you want in Quincy?
- I’m a location scout from

04:55.870 --> 04:57.760
Envision entertainment and I'm here to

04:57.760 --> 05:00.760
Procure your spots for-
- The movie.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.860
How do you know?
- Everybody in Quincy knows

05:02.860 --> 05:05.290
about the movie. 
The mayor got the call.

05:05.290 --> 05:07.810
Caroline, the new secretary 
she called her sister.

05:07.810 --> 05:09.850
Within five minutes, it had

05:09.850 --> 05:15.130
spread like wildfire.
You see there are

05:15.130 --> 05:18.130
two types of secrets in Quincy.
The ones

05:18.130 --> 05:21.790
we keep close and then we have the

05:21.790 --> 05:24.790
really juicy one. 
- And the movie news is juicy.

05:24.790 --> 05:28.330
So there shouldn't be a problem.
- No one

05:28.330 --> 05:32.110
Is gonna let you film in their home.
- Why not?

05:32.110 --> 05:33.970
They get money, fame and bragging rights.

05:33.970 --> 05:35.680
People in Quincy don't need money.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.600
Present company excluded.

05:41.039 --> 05:44.999
This is the old South. 
Bragging is a sign

05:44.999 --> 05:48.629
of weakness.
- Please, all the mansion's all

05:48.629 --> 05:51.719
the big gates.
- Mm-hmm. All old money.

05:51.719 --> 05:55.229
This movie is starring the Cole Masten.

05:55.229 --> 05:57.270
Academy Award-winning actor.
Quite possibly,

05:57.270 --> 05:59.399
the most beautiful man to grace

05:59.399 --> 06:01.860
Hollywood in the last decade.
The man

06:01.860 --> 06:03.719
women dream about in the dark of the night.

06:03.719 --> 06:08.580
Really? Not all the women.

06:08.580 --> 06:09.180
So what do I do?

06:09.180 --> 06:11.460
I need a mansion preferably two and a

06:11.460 --> 06:14.039
Bar or tractor, a cotton field 
in 15 other locations.

06:14.039 --> 06:20.669
What I think you need? You need

06:20.669 --> 06:24.509
a local somebody from Quincy. Somebody

06:24.509 --> 06:27.089
who can negotiate with the landowner and

06:27.089 --> 06:28.949
someone that can make all the necessary

06:28.949 --> 06:32.279
Arrangements with the locals.
- But that’s my job.

06:32.279 --> 06:34.469
How much they are paying you for this job?

06:34.469 --> 06:40.729
120,000 -I'll do it for 25. –15. –20.

06:40.729 --> 06:43.640
And I’m the only hope you have.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.910
[Music]

06:47.110 --> 06:49.800
Deal.

06:50.330 --> 06:54.730
[Music]

06:54.730 --> 06:59.540
Okay. Are you ready?
- Let's do it. –Cole, tell us

06:59.540 --> 07:03.230
about your wife. 
- I don't she

07:03.230 --> 07:05.480
Needs an introduction I am pretty sure

07:05.480 --> 07:07.490
you're familiar with her.
- Well, you've

07:07.490 --> 07:09.410
been married now almost five years, which,

07:09.410 --> 07:12.920
in Hollywood is quite a feat. Tell our

07:12.920 --> 07:15.020
viewers what is your best advice for a

07:15.020 --> 07:18.110
successful marriage?
That’s a good question.

07:18.110 --> 07:20.900
I think a lot of elements

07:20.900 --> 07:22.610
elements make for a successful marriage.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.850
But if I had to pick one, I would say

07:25.850 --> 07:30.110
Honesty. Honesty is crucial. 
Nadia and I

07:30.110 --> 07:32.720
have no secrets. 
We tell each other everything.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.850
Our philosophy is to get everything

07:34.850 --> 07:37.160
out in the open, no matter the

07:37.160 --> 07:41.150
Consequences.
- I think that's great. I hear

07:41.150 --> 07:42.650
you're going to my home state of Georgia

07:42.650 --> 07:46.490
for your next project. 
- I am, yes.

07:46.490 --> 07:49.010
The Fortune Bottle.
It's a story of the early days

07:49.010 --> 07:50.630
of this soda and the wealth that

07:50.630 --> 07:52.400
created in a small town called Quincy.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.700
and how a young feisty secretary played

07:55.700 --> 07:59.180
By Minka was very instrumental in the

07:59.180 --> 08:01.970
Development of the product. 
It's based on a book

08:01.970 --> 08:04.400
I read and it's also the very

08:04.400 --> 08:06.320
First time that I'm in charge 
of the production.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.440
We're gonna start filming soon.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.020
I’m looking forward to seeing

08:12.020 --> 08:13.870
The Fortune Bottle when it hits the screen.

08:13.870 --> 08:16.420
So good to see you, Jenny.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.860
Thank you so much for having me.

08:18.860 --> 08:21.370
Come back any time.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.930
Minka can't make it.

08:26.930 --> 08:28.580
She wants to reschedule the
read-through tomorrow.

08:28.580 --> 08:31.159
Her heart's not in this project, Cole,

08:31.159 --> 08:32.539
which is going to make it more difficult

08:32.539 --> 08:35.240
for me to direct her especially if she keeps

08:35.240 --> 08:38.029
rescheduling our meeting.
- She said she's in.

08:38.029 --> 08:40.279
I can't think of anybody else

08:40.279 --> 08:45.200
Who fits that role.
- We need an Ida, Cole. Can’t make the movie 

08:45.200 --> 08:46.760
without her. 
- I'll handle it.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.360
Okay, uh, do you want me to schedule a

08:50.360 --> 08:54.320
massage for you later today.
- No, take me home.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.959
I want to surprise Nadia. 
Oh, and, uh,

08:56.959 --> 08:58.579
what's going on in Quincy?

08:58.579 --> 09:01.130
Oh, the location manager 
was a real hot mess.

09:01.130 --> 09:02.540
But he has turned it around and

09:02.540 --> 09:04.459
he's securing locations as we speak.

09:04.459 --> 09:08.600
I liked my hotel. 
It has a pool and it's

09:08.600 --> 09:11.589
hot here in Georgia.

09:12.490 --> 09:14.510
Why did she just looked at you like

09:14.510 --> 09:18.980
she'd been into a bad piece.
- Quincy and I have history.

09:24.900 --> 09:25.310
Good afternoon, Mrs. Wright.

09:25.310 --> 09:27.890
This is Mr. Bennington Payne.

09:27.890 --> 09:29.959
He's in town scouting for locations for 

09:29.959 --> 09:33.390
the movie.
That'd be the one with Cole Masten?

09:33.390 --> 09:35.380
That's right. The Fortune Bottle.

09:35.380 --> 09:38.540
Mr. Payne would like to 
stay with you if you have 

09:38.540 --> 09:39.949
room, of course.

09:39.949 --> 09:44.690
Oh, would you now?
- He'll be in town for

09:44.690 --> 09:47.480
quite sometimes while, 
he prepares things

09:47.480 --> 09:49.640
for the movie and of course he's working

09:49.640 --> 09:56.769
very closely with Cole Masten.
- Oh, is that so?

09:56.769 --> 10:01.300
Well, I might just have a room for you?

10:01.300 --> 10:04.540
Mr. Payne.

[Music]

10:44.140 --> 10:51.030
[Music]

10:52.459 --> 10:53.700
How bad is this?

10:53.700 --> 10:58.770
Gargantuan bad.
- Is the movie gonna crash? 
- No, The Fortune Bottle

10:58.770 --> 11:00.240
isn't crashing, okay? 
Movies don't fall apart

11:00.240 --> 11:02.459
over this. We should be more

11:02.459 --> 11:07.320
worried if this is the end of Codia.

11:07.320 --> 11:10.380
People love Codia. 
Cole and Nadia are the

11:10.380 --> 11:12.209
glue that holds our picture-perfect
world together.

11:12.209 --> 11:14.279
They buy each other extravagant

11:14.279 --> 11:16.380
gifts and have ridiculously hot sex

11:16.380 --> 11:16.860
together.

11:16.860 --> 11:19.200
Codia can’t fall apart. They can't get

11:19.200 --> 11:20.730
divorced and we certainly can’t have Cole

11:20.730 --> 11:24.029
attempting murder on Nadia's lover.

11:24.029 --> 11:26.070
Sheriff called and he's 
worried if Cole Masten’s 

11:26.070 --> 11:28.649
violent. He's had a lot of calls

11:28.649 --> 11:30.540
from voters. This is an election year.

11:30.540 --> 11:34.140
Votes are everything.
Of all the things I'm worried about

11:34.140 --> 11:35.910
Cole Masten’s risks to townsfolk

11:35.910 --> 11:38.700
is not one of them.
- It’s not

11:38.700 --> 11:40.410
The townsfolk he's worried about.

11:40.410 --> 11:41.930
He’s worried about your 
California golden boy.

11:41.930 --> 11:45.270
This is the carry state. 
We value our

11:45.270 --> 11:48.000
personal safety here.
We don't want him getting

11:48.000 --> 11:51.209
himself shot.
- Shot? They can’t

11:51.209 --> 11:53.459
shoot the Cole Masten.
No one is shooting-

11:53.459 --> 11:59.339
Okay. Okay! Just simmer down.
I think you got a 

11:59.339 --> 12:00.560
wrinkle.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.650
[Music]
On your forehead. Yeah.

12:04.730 --> 12:08.100
The moment you’re yammering about Cadia.
- Codia! Not Cadia.

12:08.100 --> 12:11.670
Codia.
- Whateveria.

12:11.670 --> 12:16.529
[Music]

12:36.529 --> 12:44.879
Cole. – Got the divorce papers.
- Honey, just hold a second. 
I’ll be right back.

12:44.879 --> 12:47.930
Let’s go somewhere private.

13:02.590 --> 13:05.720
I'm sorry, Cole.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.330
You should have called.
I got our lawyers involved.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.580
It's over.

13:10.580 --> 13:18.970
We're over. –No. 
-I don't love you anymore.

13:18.970 --> 13:23.030
I don't know if I ever really did love you.

13:23.030 --> 13:27.470
I mean, I think, 
I just like the idea of you.

13:27.470 --> 13:32.840
- but, how?
- That we’re equals and you're

13:32.840 --> 13:39.340
no longer Bikini Babe Number 3.
- Yeah.

13:39.340 --> 13:48.260
I'm sorry. It's not personal.
- This. This

13:48.260 --> 13:51.410
makes it personal. 
Never caring about

13:51.410 --> 13:54.620
The Fortune Bottle and now you want it.

13:54.620 --> 14:00.110
It’s a joint asset.
- No, it is not. I purchased it.

14:00.110 --> 14:02.360
I am producing it. 
No one's gonna think

14:02.360 --> 14:06.620
it's a joint asset.
- I think it is and,

14:06.620 --> 14:13.130
Tony agrees. – Tony, our lawyer?
He's not my lawyer.

14:13.130 --> 14:17.630
How quickly you moved from an apology

14:17.630 --> 14:20.600
to business? 
How long have you been

14:20.600 --> 14:23.200
planning this?

14:28.030 --> 14:33.760
I need a lawyer. The best damn divorce

14:33.760 --> 14:35.050
lawyer in the country.

14:35.050 --> 14:37.030
That would be Brad DeLuca. 
He handles

14:37.030 --> 14:38.980
every big celebrity divorce. 
- Get him here

14:38.980 --> 14:40.870
I don't care the cost.
- All right. I’m on it.

14:40.870 --> 14:44.140
Wait where do you want to go?
- Anywhere with alcohol

14:44.140 --> 14:48.720
and women.
- Okay.

15:32.899 --> 15:35.899
Shit!

15:38.650 --> 15:41.220
Thank you.

15:44.170 --> 15:49.250
You're late.
- Sorry. Business to attend.

15:49.250 --> 15:53.090
Bullshit! Pussy isn’t business, 
and this,

15:53.090 --> 15:54.800
right now, is the most important
thing in your life.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.390
So when we make an appointment,

15:56.390 --> 16:02.920
keep it.
- You know you work for me, right?

16:03.700 --> 16:07.460
here. This is Leonard McCloud.

16:07.460 --> 16:09.529
He’ll put up with your bullshit and

16:09.529 --> 16:10.610
cover your ass in court.

16:10.610 --> 16:16.430
Oh, so they're the best. –Exactly.
-I've paid you

16:16.430 --> 16:23.050
your advance.
- And, I’ll refund it.
- Sit down and hold on.

16:23.050 --> 16:26.050
Please.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.730
Sit down.

16:41.449 --> 16:44.769
I'm sorry. I’m late.

16:45.279 --> 16:51.420
Sorry?
- I'm sorry.

17:00.220 --> 17:03.520
Look, you've been a celebrity
for a long time,

17:03.520 --> 17:06.819
but in a courtroom, against your wife?

17:06.819 --> 17:10.770
You’re equals to each other.

17:10.770 --> 17:13.180
You’re, you’re nothing to the judge.

17:13.180 --> 17:16.510
You’re normal. 
If I'm gonna represent you,

17:16.510 --> 17:17.890
 you have to know that life as you know

17:17.890 --> 17:18.630
it is over.

17:18.630 --> 17:21.608
You're not a bachelor yet, 
not until this divorce

17:21.608 --> 17:25.480
is final. You are my bitch, 
and I will say

17:25.480 --> 17:28.000
if and who you fuck, 
what you say to whom,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.130
and when and how you work.

17:30.130 --> 17:31.810
If you want to keep this film as yours,

17:31.810 --> 17:34.060
you will leave this shithole 
of a city and go to Georgia.

17:34.060 --> 17:36.220
You’ll keep your dick clean

17:36.220 --> 17:38.230
and that pretty-boy head of yours down

17:38.230 --> 17:41.560
and do your job… nothing else.
I've buried five,

17:41.560 --> 17:44.410
five of your indiscretion since Sunday.

17:44.410 --> 17:46.300
My team doesn't have 
time for the popularity

17:46.300 --> 17:48.370
contest your dick has entered.

17:48.370 --> 17:52.150
We are gonna paint you as Hollywood's

17:52.150 --> 17:55.420
Golden Boy. You listen to me,
and I promise you

17:55.420 --> 17:57.180
I will keep The Fortune Bottle of yours

17:57.180 --> 18:01.300
and any other shared assets you want.

18:01.300 --> 18:06.280
I just want the movie. 
She can have the rest.

18:06.280 --> 18:11.940
Okay, I need you to commit to my terms.

18:11.940 --> 18:19.560
No sex. No relationships. No women.

18:20.370 --> 18:22.760
Agreed.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.430
Oh, and,

18:25.430 --> 18:28.030
let's go.

18:28.030 --> 18:36.860
Go where? –Quincy. -Morning, Masten. 
–This guy is fucking lunatic.

18:36.860 --> 18:39.470
We’re getting in a jet right now.
Heading to Quincy.

18:39.470 --> 18:44.710
Now, now? 
– Yes. Now, now. 
It’s a fucking Brad’s idea.

18:44.710 --> 18:48.550
You’ll be there in a three and a half-

18:49.410 --> 19:04.680
[Music]

19:04.680 --> 19:08.650
Hey, you're that movie star?
Well, what you doing in Quincy?

19:08.650 --> 19:10.590
You got engine trouble?

19:10.590 --> 19:14.110
No, has my assistant not called?
- Nope.

19:14.110 --> 19:17.970
Nope, nobody's called.
- Is my car ready?

19:17.970 --> 19:25.000
- Nope.
- Bad news. Your assistant 
been in an accident.

19:25.000 --> 19:25.480
What?

19:25.480 --> 19:27.640
Posted on TMZ. 
He's alive, but he's

19:27.640 --> 19:31.810
pretty beat up.
- We got to get back to LA.

19:31.810 --> 19:35.620
- No. No.
- He's been my assistant for 13 years.

19:35.620 --> 19:37.720
I gotta go see him.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.060
No, you're not going anywhere. 
Oh, the

19:40.060 --> 19:41.020
LA hospitals are gonna be a zoo,

19:41.020 --> 19:46.500
waiting for you.
- Mean to a borrow a vehicle?

19:46.500 --> 19:49.780
That worked for you?
- Sure thing.

19:50.780 --> 19:57.550
I'm checking the local contact now.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.920
You’re going to burn.
-No, I’m not. 
–Yes, you are.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.370
You didn't put on any sunscreen.

20:08.370 --> 20:11.800
I don’t wear sunscreen. 
- You do realize the Sun is literally

20:11.800 --> 20:14.250
aging you before my eyes.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.690
You do realize you're 
in Georgia and not the

20:16.690 --> 20:17.830
Wild West and you've completely

20:17.830 --> 20:20.140
ridiculous in that cowboy hat. 
- I look

20:20.140 --> 20:22.300
fantastic.
- You look stupid.

20:22.300 --> 20:28.370
[Laughter]

20:28.530 --> 20:38.410
No days off for important people.
- Bennington Payne. Where am I right now? 
Quincy. I’m sorry. Who is this? Yes, sir?

20:38.410 --> 20:41.560
Yeah, I thought that- okay. Okay.

20:41.560 --> 20:42.070
What’s your address?

20:42.070 --> 20:45.580
4 Darrow Lane.
- 4 Darrow Lane. Okay, yeah.

20:45.580 --> 20:49.150
Thank you so- ciao! 
Cole Masten is here.

20:49.150 --> 20:50.260
That was his attorney 
wanted to know where I was

20:50.260 --> 20:53.340
He’s bringing Cole Masten, here. Now.

20:53.340 --> 20:56.710
How far away is the airport?
- Five. Maybe 10 minutes.

20:59.580 --> 21:08.020
[Music]

21:08.070 --> 21:11.050
They're not going to come inside.
They're just 

21:11.050 --> 21:13.060
coming to pick me up. 
They’d probably

21:13.060 --> 21:16.480
won't even get out of the car.
- Okay.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.620
Are you sure this is the right place?

21:29.620 --> 21:34.050
Yep. Yep, Yep.

21:34.050 --> 21:40.150
Hi. 
–Hi. Is Bennington there?

21:40.150 --> 21:43.390
[Music]

21:45.860 --> 21:50.160
Is Bennington here?
- Yes, he’s been expecting you.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.770
Uh, would you be a dear and fetch him

21:52.770 --> 22:00.630
for us.
- Sure, I'll just get it.

22:00.630 --> 22:02.930
Thank you.

22:02.930 --> 22:07.950
No!
- Hi, I’m Ben. Bennington Payne.

22:07.950 --> 22:11.700
It’s so lovely to meet you.
- Bennington, will you get

22:11.700 --> 22:13.970
Mr. Masten settled in his hotel now?

22:13.970 --> 22:16.680
I'm so sorry but because we weren't

22:16.680 --> 22:18.600
expecting Mr. Masten 
so soon, the estate

22:18.600 --> 22:19.920
where he'll be staying 
– Kirkland’s house

22:19.920 --> 22:21.420
won't be ready for a few more days

22:21.420 --> 22:24.350
but there are other options in town.

22:24.350 --> 22:28.170
Sorry, what? it turns 
out the Kirkland house

22:28.170 --> 22:30.600
isn't available yet but Bennington here-

22:30.600 --> 22:34.170
It's Ben.
- Yeah, has a few ideas where

22:34.170 --> 22:37.520
he can house you for the time being.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.670
Sorry to ruin this delightful porch party, 

22:41.670 --> 22:45.000
but can we take this inside?

22:45.000 --> 22:50.760
Air conditioning?
- Sure, if you have a second, 
can I get y’all some sweet tea.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.160
Actually, I gotta get going. 
My wife will have

22:53.160 --> 22:54.600
my head if I don't come home in time

22:54.600 --> 22:58.430
for dinner.
- I’m afraid, I didn’t catch your name?

22:58.430 --> 23:01.260
Oh, Summer. Summer Jenkins. 
It's nice to meet you. 
- I could fix you

23:01.260 --> 23:02.760
sweet tea for the road.
- No. That wouldn’t be

23:02.760 --> 23:04.520
necessary but I appreciate the offer. 

23:04.520 --> 23:10.280
Nice meeting you.
Behave!  

23:13.170 --> 23:20.280
How about that tea?
- Sparkling water, please.

23:20.280 --> 23:27.030
We don't have sparkling.
- Still is fine.

23:54.210 --> 24:02.560
How was your flight?
You do know it's rude to

24:02.560 --> 24:04.210
ignore someone when they're asking you a 

24:04.210 --> 24:06.420
question.

24:07.590 --> 24:10.870
I've booked you in a motel room for a

24:10.870 --> 24:14.430
couple of days until your estates ready.

24:16.200 --> 24:19.930
Start over I wasn't listening. 
- I found you

24:19.930 --> 24:21.340
a motel room until your state's ready

24:21.340 --> 24:25.470
in a couple of days.
- Who are you?

24:25.470 --> 24:28.300
No offense but how are 
you involved in this?

24:28.720 --> 24:31.390
She's been helping me.
- No offense, Mr. Masten,

24:31.390 --> 24:34.950
but you stood in my living room,

24:34.950 --> 24:37.480
sucking up my air-conditioner, 
drinking my

24:37.480 --> 24:42.070
still water. 
That's why I'm here and I'm

24:42.070 --> 24:45.820
not involved in anything, 
Mr. Masten. Ben here

24:45.820 --> 24:48.730
is my friend. 
We were having a pool party

24:48.730 --> 24:50.230
when your attorney called and 

24:50.230 --> 24:53.320
bulldozed y’all’s in here.

24:53.320 --> 24:59.010
You’re all Southern fight and 
spitfire attitude. - Yeah,

24:59.010 --> 25:03.070
get out or I swear to God, 
I'll shoot you.

25:03.070 --> 25:06.600
She means it. She has 
gun in her coat closet.

25:12.560 --> 25:15.800
She's fantastic.

25:16.520 --> 25:20.070
Pardon me?

25:21.070 --> 25:22.020
There’s only a month before
filming it's impossible.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.610
Minka is dying to get out of

25:23.610 --> 25:27.030
this movie. I'm telling you,
this girl is

25:27.030 --> 25:28.230
perfect.

25:28.230 --> 25:30.360
Get your ass on a plane and come to Quincy.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.880
You're an actor, Cole. 
You know everybody

25:32.880 --> 25:34.950
can't do this. 
The last thing I want is

25:34.950 --> 25:37.290
is to stick a wooden face on the screen.

25:37.290 --> 25:39.900
That's the beauty of it, Don.

25:39.900 --> 25:42.330
She won't have to act at all. 
She just has to be

25:42.330 --> 25:45.300
herself.
No. I am NOT throwing this

25:45.300 --> 25:47.400
whole movie in the can just because some

25:47.400 --> 25:49.500
wannabe starlet sucked your dick.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.340
cornfield.

25:50.340 --> 25:56.100
Cotton field. Didn’t you read the book?
And I am not in love.

25:56.100 --> 25:58.320
This girl completely blew 
me off but she was

25:58.320 --> 26:00.720
Georgian as hell doing it.

26:00.720 --> 26:04.110
Pure friggin’ Southern charm. 
I'm telling you

26:04.110 --> 26:07.350
you come here. Meet the girl,
and if you you don't

26:07.350 --> 26:11.550
like her, all right. Tell me 
to go to hell tomorrow.

26:11.550 --> 26:13.230
Alright, I have a plane 
waiting for me Van Nuys

26:13.230 --> 26:15.830
in an hour. 
- Yes!

26:15.830 --> 26:18.750
Alright, let's turn this baby around.

26:18.750 --> 26:21.630
Let's go back to the girl's place.

26:21.630 --> 26:24.870
What was her name again?
- Summer. You want to cast

26:24.870 --> 26:28.590
cast her in Minka’s role. –Yep.
- But that’s the lead.

26:28.590 --> 26:31.800
She’s perfect for the role.
- Maybe,

26:31.800 --> 26:33.420
you should let me bring it up to her.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.220
She can be a little headstrong.

26:35.220 --> 26:39.440
Yeah, I got that.
- I don’t think she likes you very much.

26:39.440 --> 26:46.899
Good. That’s a good thing.
- Summer! 

27:01.899 --> 27:08.769
He wants you to star in the movie.
- Oh, come on. Bennington Payne, 
are you yanking my legs?

27:08.769 --> 27:10.539
No, I’m not. He wants you to take
Minka Price’s role. He says you’re perfect.

27:10.539 --> 27:19.210
Authentic. He said authentic. 
“She’s perfect for the role”.
- How much does it pay?

30:39.210 --> 27:21.710
No idea but Summer, nobody 
gets opportunities like this.

27:21.710 --> 27:23.450
Girls in LA they’d screwed. 
They kidnap, they

27:23.450 --> 27:26.440
kill for something like this.
- No, seriously. How much does it pay?

27:26.440 --> 27:32.149
No idea. I don’t know. Ask Cole.
He’s in the car.
- D’you mean waiting in the car? – Yes.

27:38.149 --> 27:42.590
You must be Cole Masten.
- Oh, how’d you know?

27:42.590 --> 27:44.480
My daughter left me a voice message said

27:44.480 --> 27:47.559
don't come home. 
Cole Masten is here.

27:47.559 --> 27:50.059
And nothing makes a mother come home quicker

27:50.059 --> 27:52.480
than to tell her to stay away.

27:52.480 --> 27:56.889
How do you know Summer?
- I just met her today.

27:56.899 --> 28:02.340
A few hours ago. I came here to meet Ben.
- Oh, you work on the movie also?

28:02.340 --> 28:07.129
I’m an actor.

28:07.129 --> 28:10.039
An award-winning actor.
- Well, that's nice.

28:10.039 --> 28:12.830
I’m Francis Jenkins. 
Would you be a dear and

28:12.830 --> 28:17.269
help me inside with this stuff.
- Of course.

28:17.269 --> 28:20.730
An actor, you say?
Yes, ma'am.

28:20.730 --> 28:22.830
We need to work on that Southern drawl.

28:22.830 --> 28:26.250
Mama. I see you ignored my voicemail.

28:26.250 --> 28:30.210
Oh, you called? I must have missed that.
- Thank you.

28:38.210 --> 28:40.590
So did Ben talk to you about the part?

28:40.590 --> 28:45.960
He did. –And?
- And I’d be curious

28:45.960 --> 28:47.370
what kind of conversation you'd be offering.

28:47.370 --> 28:51.330
What kind of compensation would you like?

28:51.330 --> 28:54.059
I don't know. I don't know what

28:54.059 --> 28:56.760
would be fair. That's why I'm asking you.

28:56.760 --> 29:00.330
- And you trust me to be fair?
- Well, I trust you

29:00.330 --> 29:02.370
to give me your honest opinion about

29:02.370 --> 29:04.559
what the size of the role in this type

29:04.559 --> 29:09.019
of movie for someone of my
experience would be worth.

29:10.519 --> 29:13.080
A hundred thousand and that's being generous.

29:13.080 --> 29:16.230
Your name is negative box office weight.

29:16.230 --> 29:18.000
I'll have to spend a fortune to get you

29:18.000 --> 29:18.840
camera ready.

29:18.840 --> 29:23.279
but I like you Summer and I think you

29:23.279 --> 29:28.049
fit the part. - Don't do that.
- Do what?

29:28.049 --> 29:31.880
That smile thing. 
It's really creepy. 

29:31.880 --> 29:36.110
Millions of Americans would disagree.

29:39.020 --> 29:42.980
Are you interested or not?
- No.

29:42.980 --> 29:47.850
No, I'm not. 
-You're not?

29:47.850 --> 29:51.580
No. Not for that amount.

29:51.580 --> 29:54.980
I'm worth more.
-The toe of your shoe

29:54.980 --> 29:59.059
all together by duct tape.
- The amount of money

29:59.059 --> 30:01.010
I have is not indicative of my worth.

30:01.010 --> 30:03.470
If it was, it would indicate

30:03.470 --> 30:06.049
the lesser of us two 
individuals on this porch.

30:06.049 --> 30:07.640
You’re saying you’re nothing lesser

30:07.640 --> 30:09.350
the individual.
- I'm saying that right now

30:09.350 --> 30:10.909
the only one of us being an ass here is you.

30:10.909 --> 30:20.740
So you don’t want the part.
- No.

30:20.740 --> 30:24.399
Not for that amount.

30:28.850 --> 30:31.350
Goodbye, Mr. Masten. That’s what we say,
in the South, when one person leaves.

30:33.060 --> 30:35.760
It’s called valediction.
- What is it called

30:35.760 --> 30:43.580
when one person makes a huge mistake?
- It’s called life.

30:46.580 --> 30:49.200
Gosh, she’s infuriating.

30:57.000 --> 31:04.890
Bad day? He's very handsome.

31:04.890 --> 31:11.670
Yeah.
- Want to talk about it?

31:11.670 --> 31:13.090
That eggs already been laid. 
It can't be put back

31:13.090 --> 31:17.390
in the chicken now.
-He's very handsome.

31:17.390 --> 31:19.530
[chuckled]

31:19.530 --> 31:23.520
He's also very married.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.340
Night, Summer
- It’s late.

31:37.340 --> 31:43.840
I know how anal you are about 
calling before I come.
- Summer, I’m picking up Don Waschoniz,

31:43.840 --> 31:47.450
The Fortune Bottle’s director, in this
pisshole you called airport in 20 minutes.  

31:47.450 --> 31:53.940
Then, we’re coming to you. So meet
us outside in 30. If you can sell him
on your sweet demeanor, then,

31:53.940 --> 32:00.540
the role is yours. 
You can name your damn price.

32:00.540 --> 32:04.160
Five hundred thousand that's
what I want and then,

32:04.160 --> 32:09.940
I'll do it.
- Fine, 500,000 it is.

32:18.940 --> 32:32.520
Is that, uh-
- Apple cobbler? It is. I was gonna
make pie but I didn’t have time. 

32:32.520 --> 32:37.890
Hope that’s okay for you all.
- Oh, Mr. Don Waschoniz. 
It’s nice to meet you.

32:37.890 --> 32:41.480
I’ll have you out here on the 
porch because my mom is asleep

32:41.480 --> 32:42.950
and she has to be up early in the morning.

32:42.950 --> 32:44.179
I don't want to wake her.

32:44.179 --> 32:48.450
I thought we could all talk out here.

32:51.450 --> 32:53.470
I’ll get you all the cobbler.

33:08.510 --> 33:17.680
So you live with your mama.
- Yeah, my whole life. This is 
where I learned to make cobbler.

33:17.680 --> 33:23.460
I don’t like cobbler.
- You'll eat it and

33:23.460 --> 33:25.480
you'll like it, Mr. Masten.

33:25.480 --> 33:35.220
Ahh… there’s my girl.

33:35.220 --> 33:38.000
Coming? 
-Yeah.

33:46.120 --> 33:49.360
She’ll be out in a minute.

33:55.360 --> 34:03.330
Hey, y’all. Ben, can you grab 
the door? There you go.
 - We’re short on time, Summer. 

34:03.330 --> 34:05.400
Would you like some cobbler?
I know that you said in there

34:05.400 --> 34:07.590
that you don't like cobbler 
- I'm good.

34:07.590 --> 34:09.600
Summer, can you stand over here?

34:09.600 --> 34:15.000
Oh, sure. Like this?
- How old are you?

34:15.000 --> 34:20.190
29. Never married. 
- Turn your head to the left.

34:20.190 --> 34:21.379
Turn your head to the right.

34:21.379 --> 34:23.500
Say something. –Like what?
- Whatever comes to mind. 

34:23.500 --> 34:26.129
The brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
- Tell me about the cobbler.

34:26.129 --> 34:29.530
Cobbler? Well, I would have made pie.

34:29.530 --> 34:31.320
Pies much more popular around here

34:31.320 --> 34:33.389
but it takes a great deal longer.

34:33.389 --> 34:36.619
Look at me now. Follow me when I move.
- It’s all about the apple. 

34:36.619 --> 34:38.040
Honeycrisp or Granny Smith.

34:38.040 --> 34:41.110
[Music]

34:42.780 --> 34:44.429
I need to see some fire in you, Summer.

34:44.429 --> 34:46.469
Can you get angry for me? 
Give me some edge,

34:46.469 --> 34:48.060
Why do you want to know what
goes into my apple cobbler,

34:48.060 --> 34:50.250
Mr. Waschoniz? Are my

34:50.250 --> 34:51.989
homemade desserts not good enough for you?

34:51.989 --> 34:55.449
Don't come into my house 
and insult my cooking.

34:55.449 --> 34:57.149
I will trot your testicles up,

34:57.149 --> 34:59.010
wipe that California for a smile

34:59.010 --> 35:01.530
right off your face. 
I will poison your taste.

35:01.530 --> 35:02.450
Okay. Okay.

35:02.450 --> 35:08.550
You can do crazy? I get it.

35:07.550 --> 35:09.720
Summer, honey, are you okay?

35:09.720 --> 35:12.960
I heard voices.
- I'm sorry to wake you, mama.

35:12.960 --> 35:20.970
The movie people came. – Oh,
- They want me in the movie.

35:20.970 --> 35:27.119
In the movie? You mean, with that
good-looking young men. 
– Don’t smile like that

35:27.119 --> 35:29.369
he just wants me for the movie.

35:29.369 --> 35:36.650
You saw? 
-Mm-hmm, if you say so, honey.

35:42.300 --> 35:53.340
[Music]

35:53.340 --> 35:57.030
This is a joke, right?

35:57.030 --> 36:00.550
This isn't actually where 
I'm supposed to be

36:00.550 --> 36:04.080
staying for the next three months.

36:13.240 --> 36:16.480
Please tell me, it's just this room.

36:16.480 --> 36:23.720
Curtains with chickens. Really?
-They’re roosters. You can tell 
by the red comb and the wattles.

36:23.720 --> 36:27.170
I want this chicken shit out of here.
- Oh, come on.

36:27.170 --> 36:28.970
It’s cute and homey.

36:28.970 --> 36:31.210
We can't change any of the décor.

36:31.210 --> 36:33.110
Actually that was a very 
firm stipulation

36:33.110 --> 36:34.550
in renting the Kirkland’s house.

36:34.550 --> 36:36.470
We can't move or change anything.

36:36.470 --> 36:39.140
And who exactly agreed to that bullshit?

36:39.140 --> 36:41.300
We did and that bullshit is the only

36:41.300 --> 36:42.350
reason you're standing in some

36:42.350 --> 36:45.890
cockroach infested motel. Ben here, 

36:45.890 --> 36:47.500
Ben is working his ass off for you. 

36:47.500 --> 36:49.010
I think you know about it all the way in

36:49.010 --> 36:50.110
California with all you-

37:00.110 --> 37:03.120
What’s wrong with you?
-What wrong with me? Are you 
kidding me? You’re just-

37:03.120 --> 37:09.310
Kiss you. Yeah. Big deal. 
You wouldn’t shut up.
- You didn’t ask me to shut up.

37:10.310 --> 37:16.610
You don’t usually ask people to shut up. 
You tell them to.
- Hell, I’m telling you

37:16.610 --> 37:18.890
kiss me again like that 
and I’ll rip your eyes

37:18.890 --> 37:20.540
out from their sockets.

37:20.540 --> 37:24.560
Well, don’t worry princess. 
I have no desire

37:24.560 --> 37:28.510
to repeat that experience.
I’ve had better.

37:28.510 --> 37:32.980
Much, much better.

37:38.880 --> 37:44.800
where's she going?
- Home. Holden’s plantation

37:44.800 --> 37:47.340
and Kirkland’s house. 
They’re neighboring estates.

37:47.340 --> 37:52.980
She was living right next?
How pissed is she right now?

37:52.980 --> 37:54.520
Never mind.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.830
Don't answer that. 
Let’s go, uh, we’ll see

37:56.830 --> 38:00.300
some locations.
-You’re okay?

38:04.800 --> 38:09.840
[Music]

38:24.309 --> 38:30.500
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What? It's 8:00 in the morning?

38:31.500 --> 38:31.509
I’m well aware of that. 
And my wife has come

38:31.509 --> 38:33.099
three times so far this morning, 
so get your ass

38:33.099 --> 38:37.769
out of bed and be productive.
- I’m on California time.

38:37.769 --> 38:40.569
I was very clear on my instructions to you.

38:40.569 --> 38:42.099
You were to go to Quincy and behave.

38:42.099 --> 38:43.749
Not run around grabbing the first

38:43.749 --> 38:49.329
single woman you find. And then 
you made her your co-star?
- How do you know that?

38:49.329 --> 38:52.839
Deadline.
- It hasn't hit any press. But it will.

38:52.839 --> 38:54.009
And Nadia’s attorneys are gonna

38:54.009 --> 38:57.749
crucify you with it. You can’t put your 
new girlfriend in the movie that we’re trying-

38:57.749 --> 39:02.109
She’s not my new girlfriend.
I’m sorry. Your new fuck
- No.

39:02.109 --> 39:06.670
She is nothing and I didn't cast her ‘cos of-

39:06.670 --> 39:11.400
I cast her because she is Ida Pinkerton.

39:11.400 --> 39:18.309
She’s perfect for the movie;
she was born for this role.

39:18.309 --> 39:25.259
And you’d be proud of me because 
I’m behaving. I haven’t thought 
about Nadia once I settle down here.

39:25.510 --> 39:32.400
Then why did you kiss her?
- How did you know that?

39:32.510 --> 39:39.000
The scout told me. We hired him.
- There was nothing. That kiss was nothing.

39:39.099 --> 39:42.420
This relationship with her worth half of
The Fortune Bottle because that's what 
is at stake here.

39:42.420 --> 39:47.369
There is no relationship. Can I just

39:47.369 --> 39:48.569
go back to sleep now?

39:48.569 --> 39:52.420
Sure. At least when you're sleeping
I don’t have to worry about you.

39:52.420 --> 39:56.940
Check your email when you wake up. 
I sent over the response we filed 
against Nadia. It’s brutal;

39:56.940 --> 39:58.470
I’m just gonna warn you. I don't want to

39:58.470 --> 40:00.990
punish Nadia. I just-
- We’re only being aggressive about

40:00.990 --> 40:02.460
The Fortune Bottle, though I think

40:02.460 --> 40:04.270
you're being a fucking Saint
about everything.

40:04.270 --> 40:07.220
Pop you later.

40:37.650 --> 40:41.550
What?
- I brought you something.

40:41.550 --> 40:44.040
Is it breakfast?
- Are you just going to holler down at me

40:44.040 --> 40:48.600
in the rain, or are you gonna let me in?

40:54.930 --> 41:00.359
I could have waited for you 
to put some clothes on.

41:00.359 --> 41:02.460
I don't think so.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.529
You seem very persistent with those rocks.

41:07.529 --> 41:12.240
What do you have for me?
Can you please put some pants on?

41:12.240 --> 41:15.619
It’s rude to waltz around with your junk out.

41:15.619 --> 41:18.660
I know yesterday was a little 
rough so I wanted

41:18.660 --> 41:19.619
to make it up to you with the

41:19.619 --> 41:24.260
housewarming present.
- A housewarming present.

41:24.260 --> 41:30.150
To mend the fences. 
Between you and me.

41:30.150 --> 41:34.039
You want to kiss and make up.

41:34.039 --> 41:39.529
In a metaphorical sense, yeah.

41:41.490 --> 41:51.060
What you get for me? 
–Right. Are you crazy?

41:51.060 --> 41:53.500
Is that a serious question?
- What normal person

41:53.500 --> 41:55.050
will get someone a fucking bird

41:55.050 --> 41:57.360
for the housewarming gift.
- It’s not a bird.

41:57.360 --> 42:03.730
He's a baby rooster. Oh, come on. 
I thought it would be funny.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.880
It’s hilarious. What am I

42:05.880 --> 42:09.630
supposed to do with him? Eat them?
- No, he’s a

42:09.630 --> 42:10.460
pet.

42:10.460 --> 42:15.500
I'm serious, Summer. 
I can't have a rooster.

42:15.500 --> 42:18.380
I don't have time. I'm too busy.

42:18.380 --> 42:20.850
I don't know anything about chickens.

42:20.850 --> 42:24.150
It’s a rooster. I've had Fred 
sexed him for me.

42:24.150 --> 42:25.440
You'll be able to tell by the little

42:25.440 --> 42:27.990
spikes on the top of his head. 
Now I need

42:27.990 --> 42:29.580
you to line this with 
newspaper. Make

42:29.580 --> 42:31.560
sure the lamp stays on all night.

42:31.560 --> 42:33.990
Baby chickens need a lot of warmth.
- You are

42:33.990 --> 42:37.619
taking this thing home with you.
- No, I’m not.

42:37.619 --> 42:42.840
It's a gift and you do not refuse

42:42.840 --> 42:47.480
gifts. It’s rude.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.030
[Music]

42:49.030 --> 42:55.290
Oh and Cole? Welcome to Quincy.

42:55.590 --> 42:58.780
[Music]

43:26.660 --> 43:29.430
Hey, aren’t you the guy, that, uh

43:29.430 --> 43:33.450
I just got a baby rooster,
Cocky. I set the most 

43:33.450 --> 43:36.880
original name but-
- Why'd you bring it with you?

43:36.880 --> 43:42.570
I don't know. I mean, 
doesn't it need 

43:42.570 --> 43:44.790
to be checked out or I don't know

43:44.790 --> 43:48.840
if I could leave it alone?

43:49.800 --> 43:55.550
You know, it's a chicken.

43:55.550 --> 43:59.490
It ain't a pet. 
I mean, you don't need to give

43:59.490 --> 44:03.190
it a name or put up a
bedazzled collar on it.

44:07.190 --> 44:13.800
What does it eat?
- Corn.

44:13.800 --> 44:18.930
Corn? That's it?
- Yeah, it's a chicken. 
I mean we ain't got

44:18.930 --> 44:21.030
no Chef Boyardee nine flavors

44:21.030 --> 44:25.500
rainbow got a crap.

44:25.020 --> 44:25.680
If you want to get fancy,

44:25.680 --> 44:27.480
You can use that FRM formula over there

44:27.480 --> 44:30.960
and cost twice as much. 
They don't make a

44:30.960 --> 44:34.400
squat shit a bit of difference.

44:34.700 --> 44:37.170
Anything else I might need for him?

44:37.170 --> 44:42.420
Vitamins? Shots? medicines?
- It's a ch-

44:42.420 --> 44:45.740
Chicken, yeah. Got it.

44:56.380 --> 45:00.500
Hello. Special delivery from
Miss Ida Pinkerton.

45:00.500 --> 45:04.930
Here's a script
- Thank you.

45:04.930 --> 45:07.390
Love that dress would look better on me.

45:07.390 --> 45:11.680
You sign that contract yet?
- It's eight-two pages long.

45:11.680 --> 45:13.860
There can't be anything good 
to say in that many pages.

45:13.860 --> 45:16.870
Then get an agent like a 
good little actress and

45:16.870 --> 45:18.730
have them look it over.
- And have them take a percentage?

45:18.730 --> 45:21.910
No.
- Summer, I can't even with you.

45:21.910 --> 45:25.000
Either sign the thing or 
pay someone to review it.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.340
Hell, get a lawyer.

45:27.340 --> 45:31.000
Pay him an hourly review.
- My ex is a lawyer.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.960
- Do you trust him?
- I hate him but,

45:34.960 --> 45:38.260
yeah, in business, I do.
- Great. Give him a call.

45:38.260 --> 46:05.800
I gotta run. Mwah!
- Bye.

46:05.800 --> 46:10.290
Hi, Scott.
- Summer, how are you?

46:10.290 --> 46:13.540
Fine, thank you. I have a contract 
that I'd like you to look over.

46:13.540 --> 46:18.480
If you good. 
- Okay, yeah.  I can do that just,

46:18.480 --> 46:20.830
uh, send it on over to 
Shelley, my assistant.

46:20.830 --> 46:22.000
And she'll make sure I get that today.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.030
I know who Shelley is. 
She was one of our bridesmaid.

46:25.030 --> 46:28.190
Of course you do. 
Something I'm used to saying.

46:28.190 --> 46:34.700
It's a talent contract for the new movie

46:34.700 --> 46:35.290
they want me to be in.

46:35.290 --> 46:38.280
Really? 
- Cole wants me for the lead.

46:38.280 --> 46:45.420
Cole?
- I've got to run, Scott and uh, 
I'll send it to Shelley.

46:53.110 --> 46:55.190
There's have been a lot of curiosity

46:55.190 --> 46:59.770
about you in town. You work in the movie.

46:59.770 --> 47:02.270
That's just distracting facts from their

47:02.270 --> 47:10.410
original business toward me.

47:10.410 --> 47:13.250
Well, I was thinking that 
you want to leave.

47:13.250 --> 47:15.500
And that's why you wanted the job.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.600
For the money and a fresh start.

47:17.600 --> 47:22.100
Oh no, don't you worry about me.
I mean,

47:22.100 --> 47:23.510
that is what you do or not.

47:23.510 --> 47:25.850
Yeah, right? This little- 
you feeling guilty?

47:25.850 --> 47:29.540
Quincy was a great place for you

47:29.540 --> 47:32.560
to grow up, Summer. 
But you're a woman now.

47:32.560 --> 47:35.690
And you you need to find your own place

47:35.690 --> 47:41.210
in the world. 
I know that and I wouldn't be

47:41.210 --> 47:46.280
a good mama if I tried to hold you back.

47:46.280 --> 47:53.240
Where will you go? 
- I don't know,

47:53.240 --> 47:55.670
but I know I want to be 
somewhere different.

47:55.670 --> 48:02.080
I want to be someone different.

48:03.330 --> 48:06.900
Someone without a path. 
Someone without scorn.

48:10.840 --> 48:13.840
I want where I want to be is 
someone with a future.

48:16.840 --> 48:19.000
Will you come with me?

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
No.

48:22.330 --> 48:27.940
No sweetie. I won't. But you
will always have a home.

48:28.940 --> 48:31.930
Right here, with me. 
So let that give

48:31.930 --> 48:34.870
you the confidence to go right out there

48:34.870 --> 48:37.740
and take some risks.

48:39.150 --> 48:43.140
You deserve that, Summer.

48:44.630 --> 48:47.630
Deserve that.

49:10.290 --> 49:16.440

49:16.440 --> 49:19.300
Can you believe they 
cast Summer as the

49:19.300 --> 49:21.370
leading lady?
- And she had the nerve to

49:21.370 --> 49:23.140
call Scott and ask for his help.

49:23.140 --> 49:26.550
Hasn't she done enough to that poor boy?

49:26.550 --> 49:29.470
Maggie! Hi. 
How's that husband of yours?

49:29.470 --> 49:31.870
He's got one foot on a banana peel and

49:31.870 --> 49:34.800
the other on the grave, honey.

50:30.310 --> 50:36.350
Nice truck.
- Brand new. Bought all by myself 

50:36.350 --> 50:38.300
without my assistance help

50:38.300 --> 50:41.080
because he's in the Hospital.

50:41.080 --> 50:44.620
Did you put him there?

50:48.420 --> 50:52.559
What did you want?
I'm trying to call you for

50:52.559 --> 50:54.180
the past three hours.
You're not picking up

50:54.180 --> 50:58.500
your cell phone.
I don't have a cell phone.

50:58.500 --> 50:59.940
No, you've been calling the 
house phone. I've been

50:59.940 --> 51:02.760
out here working.
- You don't have a cell phone.

51:02.760 --> 51:08.000
- Nope.
- You need to get a cell phone.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.410
At least for the next 
couple of months until

51:10.410 --> 51:12.180
the movie wraps then you're welcome to

51:12.180 --> 51:16.000
go back to your life of reclusion, 
if you like.

51:17.109 --> 51:22.660
- Why were you calling me?
- You got media training tomorrow

51:23.660 --> 51:24.500
Are you building this fence?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.779
- Mm-hmm.
- Isn't there someone more-

51:27.779 --> 51:30.299
Don't you dare says- 
I'm more qualified.

51:30.299 --> 51:35.819
- I'll help. 
- Hey, City Boy. You stay in the truck.

51:35.819 --> 51:37.680
We don't want you getting dirty.

51:45.680 --> 51:49.970
I know how to fix the fence, Country.

51:53.089 --> 51:59.660
You called me City Boy. Stay.

52:10.890 --> 52:17.450
Cocky. Just set him down on
the tailgate and roam around.

53:59.450 --> 52:27.380
- You brought the chicken.
- I'd figure you want to see him.

52:34.299 --> 52:42.819
- Where did you ever build a fence before?
- Didn't you ever seen the Legends of Montana?

52:42.819 --> 52:46.069
Nope.
- Spent six months on the ranch. 
Bought the

52:46.069 --> 52:51.619
damn thing afterwards. 
So yeah, I know

52:51.619 --> 52:54.519
how to fix a fence.

53:12.789 --> 53:17.180
Thank you for your help. 
Got a lot of chores

53:17.180 --> 53:23.000
to do before the movie starts. 
Yeah.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.390
See you around.

53:26.319 --> 53:31.000
See you at the media training.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.650
I'm Brecken Nichols, 
media consultant in charge of PR

53:33.650 --> 53:35.269
for the fortune bottle. 
You will be required

53:35.269 --> 53:36.890
to help promote the movie so we need

53:36.890 --> 53:37.670
to make sure that you handle

53:37.670 --> 53:39.019
yourself with confidence and 

53:39.019 --> 53:40.759
professionalism. 
We're going to review

53:40.759 --> 53:42.619
posture, smiling for 
the camera, jargons

53:42.619 --> 53:45.549
and abstractions. 
Set up straight. Okay.

53:45.549 --> 53:52.450
Hold yourself with poise. 
It just-

53:53.120 --> 54:07.480
[Music]

54:07.480 --> 54:10.610
Relax. You, literally, 
look like you have a

54:10.610 --> 54:11.510
stick up your ass.

54:11.510 --> 54:15.000
Glad I'm not the only one she hates. 
Grab some lunch.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.090
I'll work with her for a bit.

54:17.090 --> 54:19.550
You know, I don't eat. 
Neither should you

54:19.550 --> 54:26.000
by the way.
- Who is she?

54:27.000 --> 54:30.120
I'm going to turn of the camera.

54:36.120 --> 54:42.200
How many you guys have worked on so far?
- Uh, something about jargon and

54:42.200 --> 54:45.890
abstractions. 
As you can see it's gone

54:45.890 --> 54:49.500
real well.
- You don't have to worry about jargon.

54:49.500 --> 54:52.730
You're Southern, that's okay.
Okay.

54:52.730 --> 54:56.930
We don't need you to change that. 
Ordinance,

54:56.930 --> 55:02.420
though, might be a problem for you.
Rambling.

55:02.420 --> 55:05.960
Don't ramble. Abstractions. 
The verbal fillers,

55:05.960 --> 55:07.820
that 'you knows', the 'uhhs'-

55:07.820 --> 55:12.040
I know, I know. 
The fidgeting, blinking,

55:12.040 --> 55:16.900
Summer, look at me.

55:18.440 --> 55:24.260
Forget the rules. 
Just ask me a question.

55:24.260 --> 55:31.099
- What kind of question?
- Any kind of question.

55:36.059 --> 55:39.079
Are you in pain?

55:41.670 --> 55:45.089
You don't seem upset about her leaving.

55:45.089 --> 55:53.239
Don't ramble. 
Be concise and don't look away.

55:53.239 --> 55:56.989
That indicates shame.

56:00.730 --> 56:02.600
Nadia and I were together for a long time.

56:02.700 --> 56:06.160
Whenever you lose someone after a

56:06.160 --> 56:11.160
long time, it hurts. 
But I think it's for the best.

56:11.160 --> 56:13.660
She's happier in her new relationship.

56:13.660 --> 56:18.890
And that's what I want. 
For her to be happy.

56:23.890 --> 56:24.640
That's what I would say if a reporter

56:24.640 --> 56:27.940
asked. 
It would put me on the

56:27.940 --> 56:31.549
high road and subtly turned 
everyone against her.

56:34.549 --> 56:39.700
Is it the truth?

56:39.100 --> 56:53.270
No. Feel very odd about Nadia. 
I feel stupid.

56:53.270 --> 56:55.740
I feel off balance.

56:55.740 --> 56:59.570
I feel taken advantage of.

57:03.750 --> 57:08.440
I like that answer better.
So would the press.

57:09.440 --> 57:11.550
The truth is always more

57:11.550 --> 58:56.100
interesting but it's also 
much more dangerous.

57:23.100 --> 57:25.670
Do you feel closer to me now?

57:25.670 --> 57:35.700
Having heard that?
- Yeah.

57:34.700 --> 57:39.000
If the public knows you, Summer. 
They will destroy you.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.260
I can't help themselves. 
They love our weaknesses

57:43.260 --> 57:47.700
so much, that they dig deeper, 
they feast

57:47.700 --> 57:51.180
and pillage on our exposures until we

57:51.180 --> 57:56.960
ask people- you as Summer, 
me as Cole-are gone.

57:56.960 --> 58:00.390
And all there's left is what they want

58:00.390 --> 58:09.640
to see. Any other questions?
- What?

58:09.640 --> 58:13.690
- Ask it.
- Were you telling the truth when you said,

58:13.690 --> 58:17.100
I was a bad kisser?

58:18.510 --> 58:27.250
No. -No.
- Be concise. Don't ramble.

58:27.250 --> 58:29.560
I suppose being evasive is one of the 

58:29.560 --> 58:32.490
rules also, right?
- Yeah, actually it is.

58:32.490 --> 58:38.230
Anytime you can be evasive, you should.
- Wait!

58:44.450 --> 58:59.070
Thank you. It's been a while 
I needed to hear that.
-It's been a while since you were kissed?

59:04.450 --> 59:06.380
Don and I are meeting at my place

59:06.380 --> 59:08.270
tomorrow morning early to go over the script.

59:08.270 --> 59:10.370
You should be there.

59:10.370 --> 59:16.400
- Sure. What time?
- but I'm 8 a.m. Don't be late.

59:16.400 --> 59:19.000
Okay. We're ready to get back at it.

59:19.000 --> 59:33.520
- Yeah.
- Sit. Not like you're milking a cow.

59:49.860 --> 59:51.260
Where's summer?
- I don't know. Her line's been busy.

59:54.260 --> 59:59.000
- Busy. Is everything okay.

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:12.430
- Yeah.
- I'll go get her.

It was. Stupid!

01:05:45.369 --> 01:05:50.740
Is this something that you do? 
You'd go psycho after you fuck someone. 

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:56.450
I don't fuck people and I'm not a psycho. 
I just don't want to

01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:59.710
cuddle with my co-star.
- Co-star?

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:03.590
Pretty high on yourself, aren't you?
- Oh, you really are

01:06:03.590 --> 01:06:06.640
an asshole.

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:11.859
Summer, am I missing something?

01:06:11.859 --> 01:06:15.970
Did I do something to piss you off?
- Yeah, you're married.

01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:25.460
My wife fucked half of Hollywood while

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.800
we were married.
- Oh, that's what marriage is to you too.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.690
She cheats so you cheat? 
Everyone goes away

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:30.830

I never from the day 
I met Nadia, kissed

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:39.670
another woman, 
slept with another woman.

01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:45.580
Not until she served me divorced papers.

for your big day tomorrow.

Don't you mind them, honey.
- I don't. I just don't

01:08:09.249 --> 01:08:10.019
feel great.

01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:16.339
You're probably going to help me anyway.

01:08:17.339 --> 01:08:22.929
I'm an idiot. 
- You're not an idiot.

01:08:22.929 --> 01:08:26.359
No, I'm an idiot.
- You're not gonna get pregnant, are you?

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:27.500
Because that would make you an idiot.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.569
No. I have a morning-after pill.
- You bagged a movie star. You should be

01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:35.189
bragging on Twitter and 
throwing a fucking party.

01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:40.899
Seriously, Ben. How much if 
I did mess this up?
- By screwing your co-star?

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.520
Honey, you wouldn't be Hollywood if you

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.399
didn't bang a co-star at some point.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:46.899
It's nothing. 
Don't let it affect your performance?

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:49.779
- I won't.
- It's a good thing

01:08:49.779 --> 01:08:51.609
my character hates it and we started

01:08:51.609 --> 01:08:54.759
filming more now. 
I just want to get this movie

01:08:54.759 --> 01:08:57.939
out the way and leave town. 
Forget my past and forget Cole.

Masten.

01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:09.840
When do you leave?
- A few days. No more beer.

Now let's bring you into the 21st century

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:16.670

Cocky tried to crow this morning.

01:09:33.559 --> 01:09:34.759
I was in the kitchen when 
I heard him in the yard.

01:09:34.759 --> 01:09:37.729
First, I thought it was hurt.

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:41.179

Takes him a while to figure it out.
- Yeah.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.368
It was pathetic.

01:09:46.368 --> 01:09:52.000
I was embarrassed for him.
- Oh, he'll learn.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.329
And when he does, he'll do it 
all hours of the day.

01:09:56.329 --> 01:09:59.500
Not just at dawn like in the movies.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.980
Gotta love Hollywood, right?

01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:13.290
Do you need something?

01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:22.790
- Are we good? 
- Stay out of my way and we'll be just fine.

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:27.910
- I don't chase, Summer.
- This is not a game!

01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:30.870
I'm not saying one thing and meaning another.

01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:36.000
Leave me alone.
- I was wrong about you.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.470
You're a terrible actress.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:13.790
It's my money, and I think 
I know how I want to spend it.

01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:17.900
Honey, you don't want to invest in refreshments.

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:19.630
Let the boys

01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:21.900
downtown give you a 
Certificate of Deposit

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:23.200
for that money.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.160
Or bonds. Bonds are a
great safe place for

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.500
your little inheritance to sit.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.260
Don't talk down to me. 
If I wanted to let my money

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:33.620
and smoke it like your cheap cigars,

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:37.800
I'll do so. I believe in this product,

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.360
just as much as you and all the other

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:44.190
investors. I want in.

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:02.550
Thank you, Mr. Mitchell.

01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:04.320
Some of the investors aren't wild about

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.570
having a woman on board, Miss Pinkerton.

01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:09.000
And what would your opinion be on the matter?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.179
I love women. Then again, 
you already knew that,

01:12:15.179 --> 01:12:18.389
didn't you, Ms. Pinkerton?
- I have no idea

01:12:18.389 --> 01:12:22.130
what you're talking about, Mr. Mitchell.

01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:30.929
Don't touch me!
- I'm sorry, Country. I thought you liked it

01:12:30.929 --> 01:12:31.920
when I touched you.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:38.590
CUT! What the fuck was that?
- Ask your golden boy here.

01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:42.199
He put condoms in my suitcase.

01:12:42.199 --> 01:12:45.360
Is that too racy for you Southern belles?

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.900
Relax, Summer. It's a prank.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.360
Stop it, you two!

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.509
I did not sign on to referee. 
Let's wrap for today.

01:12:54.509 --> 01:13:56.790
It's fine. It's funny.
- Look at her.

01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:05.950
So did we get it?
- I think so, despite your best efforts.

01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:10.980
She needed her feathers ruffled a little.

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:14.460
She's getting too tense.

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:21.530
It's my money and I think I know 
how I want to spend it.
- Honey, 

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:24.540
you don't want to invest in refreshments.
Let the boys

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:27.119
downtown give you a Certificate 
of Deposit for that money.

01:13:27.119 --> 01:13:33.699
Or bonds. Bonds are a great, a safe 
place for your little inheritance to sit.

01:13:33.699 --> 01:13:37.349
Don't talk down to me. If I 
wanted to light my money and smoke it

01:13:37.349 --> 01:13:41.340
like your cheap cigars, I'll do so.
But I believe

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:43.079
in this product just as much as you

01:13:43.079 --> 01:13:48.969
or any of the other investors.
And I want in.

01:13:55.780 --> 01:14:01.800
Thank you, Mr. Mitchell.
- It's good. Beauty changes when she's mad.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.570
Another reason to push her buttons.

01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:08.500
Do want to show him the other cut?
- Yeah, roll it.

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:12.150
- What? What cut?
- I have no idea what

01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:15.710
you're talking about, Mr. Mitchell.

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:29.359
[Music]

01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:39.400
- So?
- What's the purpose of that cut?

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.050
It's hot.

01:14:40.050 --> 01:14:41.520
I mean, I've got a hard-on just from

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.620
watching it. Look, Mr. Masten,

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:45.750
The other stuff is good but 
this stuff has emotion.

01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:47.489
It's got heat. 
You two look like you're

01:14:47.489 --> 01:14:48.900
moments away from banging right there on

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.659
the desk.

01:14:50.659 --> 01:14:54.300
He's right. I hate like hell to say it,

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:58.600
but he's right.
- We can't use this. It's too- 

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.390
Real? Ida and Royce hate each other.
That’s

01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:02.880
already in there. 
But if we can use that

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.610
hatred to make sexual tension, it'll

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:08.000
bring up a whole other element into the film.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.630
And it would bring in the female viewers

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.610
who, right now, we have no draw on,

01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:14.969
other than your pretty mug.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:17.640
- She would never go for it.
- Since when does that matter?

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:23.000
She doesn't have script approval.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:27.710
Okay, let's do it.

01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:38.280
[Music]

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.330
- Hi, Gus.
- Hey, Summer.

01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:44.679
- Is that Cocky?
- Friendly thing. You know, 
I heard Cole Masten keeps him in the house.

01:15:44.679 --> 01:15:45.850
Yeah?

01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:49.239
Where'd you hear that?
- Around. Drove him here

01:15:49.239 --> 01:15:52.469
this morning in his truck.

01:15:53.469 --> 01:15:55.420
Good morning. I've put the 

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:57.520
Sides and updated Call sheet in here.
- Great.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.150
Thank you.

01:15:58.150 --> 01:15:59.260
There is a new scene so you want to

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:02.639
review it before your call time.
- Okay.

01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:10.780
There's a kiss. 
There is no love story

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:13.210
between Ida and Royce. 
I have read the book.

01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:16.590
Three times. 
- I saw that in the damn book.

01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:19.449
It's the movie. Writers are adding

01:16:19.449 --> 01:16:20.889
the excitement. If you're
in the business, you know.

01:16:20.889 --> 01:16:23.690
It's normal.
- You know I've read the script.

01:16:23.690 --> 01:16:27.850
Ida and Royce hate each. 
Why would Royce suddenly

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:29.650
pushes Ida against the file cabinet

01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:31.389
and kisses her passionately. 
It is stupid.

01:16:31.389 --> 01:16:33.429
The passion from their hatred will make

01:16:33.429 --> 01:16:36.790
it hotter.
- No, it doesn't make it hotter.

01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:40.360
It makes it stupid. 
I swear if he kisses me.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:44.320
I'll be losing.
- Yes you will. You'll

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.739
fall apart under my mouth, baby.
- Please.

01:16:47.739 --> 01:16:52.310
Don't flatter yourself. 
I don't even like you.

01:16:54.310 --> 01:17:55.909
Stupid side!

01:17:02.909 --> 01:17:08.120
- Well, that went well.
- What did you expect? 
We threw this on her without warning.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.530
I told you. We should meet with
her this morning go over

01:17:11.530 --> 01:17:13.600
the changes to prepare her. 
But no,

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.909
you wanted to dump it on her via call

01:17:15.909 --> 01:17:21.429
sheets and sides.
- Dump it on her. I was one of the 

01:17:21.429 --> 01:17:22.170
hottest man alive last year.

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:25.239
It's not like she has to 
mentally adjust to a war camp.

01:17:25.239 --> 01:17:28.739
How hard can it be to kiss me?

01:17:29.509 --> 01:17:32.909
It's actually three kisses and a grope.

01:17:35.409 --> 01:17:40.070
I'll go talk to her.
- No! With my luck,

01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:42.619
you two would make up and any 
authenticity to the scene

01:17:42.619 --> 01:17:45.749
will disappear.
Just stay away from her.

01:17:45.489 --> 01:17:49.370
Cole! Cole!

01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:54.000
[Music]

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:59.270
- I want blue.
- Red is punchy.

01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:02.990
Red looks iconic. Red is patriotic.

01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:08.189
[Music]

01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:12.200
[Music]

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:18.750
All right, yes! Come on. 
Come on, people. Time is money.

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:20.370
- Yeah?
- I need in California tomorrow 
morning. You've been

01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:21.900
summoned. 
It's an initial play

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:23.790
mediation. I've arranged 
it with your director.

01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:26.250
Shoot your scene then get you ass

01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:28.410
to LA.
- Good.

01:18:32.410 --> 01:18:35.270
This is stupid.
- What's the problem, Summer?

01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:38.700
Royce gives Ida a car, 
and in return, she kisses him.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.660
It's a peace offering.

01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:42.750
I would never accept a car. 
She certainly

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.280
wouldn't be jumping up and down doing

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:44.840
this whole pathetic routine, 
you guys,

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.790
have all these screwed.
- It's not

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:48.570
pathetic.

01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:51.270
It's how women in the forties acted.

01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:53.220
You have to realize she's a divorced woman

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.920
looking for a man. 
Royce is giving her a

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:59.130
very generous gift, 
and when she hugs him

01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:02.010
in gratitude, 
he goes in for the kiss.

01:19:02.010 --> 01:19:05.160
It's logical.
- It is logical if she's a woman

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.380
sits at home all day knitting. 
It is not

01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:09.510
logical for Ida Pinkerton, 
one of the

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:19.810
Original 67. Am I the only 
one that read the book?
- Script aren't the book. It's an adaptation.

01:19:21.810 --> 01:19:27.560
Summer, I gotta get on a plan in two hours.
Please, don't fight me on this.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:33.690
You're leaving?
- Yeah, I gotta go home, rather, Los

01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:37.230
Angeles for the night. 
My home is under

01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:39.960
the control of my ex. 
- Are you gonna stay?

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:43.230
That came out wrong.

01:19:43.230 --> 01:19:46.860
Nevermind.
- I'm at the hotel. I'm meeting with

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:49.190
the lawyers tomorrow about the divorce.

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:53.010
Can we just please, 
say our lines and get this baby 

01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:55.400
wrapped up?
- But it's not real

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.300
I don't want to do this. 
This is not a character.

01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:00.390
Then ad lib it. 
Just like you did in the office.

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:04.210
But in return I need a kiss.

01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:08.530
- Yes.
- Yes, I know,

01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:11.740
painful. Trust me, Country. 
I'm not looking

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:18.970
forward anymore than you are.
- Liar.

01:20:18.970 --> 01:20:21.010
Yes, baby. And so are you.

01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:23.970
- Let's roll.
- Lock it down.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.250
Do you mind watching Cocky 
for me while I'm gone?

01:20:38.690 --> 01:20:42.800
Of cource.
- Just don't want him to be alone.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.210
I could take him over to my place.

01:20:46.210 --> 01:20:52.200
Or I'm cooking over yours.
- Yeah, if you don't mind.

01:20:52.150 --> 01:20:56.610
That's better for Cocky.

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:05.840
[Music]

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:10.070
And, action!

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.040
Well, Miss Pinkerton, 
what do you think?

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.180
Very impressive.

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:22.500
Do you decorate all your new cars, 
Mr. Mitchell.

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:26.720
- It's for you.
- Me?

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:32.220
- Yes. It's red. 
- I'm a woman, Mr. Mitchell.

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.820
- Not colourblind.
- You are  also not very

01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:40.080
appreciative. It's soda 
bottle beer. I had

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.990
a dealership mix the colour just for you.

01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:46.020
How very generous of you. 
Where's my car?

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:50.370
- This is your new car. 
- I'm not deaf, colourblind,

01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:54.330
or stupid. 
I can see that the car is red.

01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:58.500
However, you are of some misunderstanding

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.810
that I would be happy to accept this

01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:04.470
from you.
Well, indeed. That is my

01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:07.200
misunderstanding, Miss Pinkerton. 
But I'm glad

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.820
that for once today we are on the

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.850
same page.

01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:15.000
- Where's my car? The black Ford.
- Well, I'm not

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.430
entirely sure.
- Could you focus at the matter

01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:19.340
at hand.
- Get it back.

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:23.130
- You don't want it back.
- You don't know what I want.

01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:27.440
I know you want this.

01:22:35.290 --> 01:23:02.129
[Music]

01:23:02.659 --> 01:23:06.130
I mean what I said,

01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:08.310
Mr. Mitchell.
- About what?

01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:13.620
I don't want it.
- And us?

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:20.139
I don't want the car and I'd 
appreciated it if you got mine back.

01:23:20.139 --> 01:23:23.550
Understood, Miss Pinkerton.

01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:28.060
Enjoy your long walk home.

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:37.510
And cut!<Beautiful. We got it.
Cole,

01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:39.220
great job. Go catch your plane.

01:23:39.220 --> 01:24:47.199
[Music]

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:14.370
Hey, it's Cole. 
Just wanna check and see if

01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:17.460
your new cell phone's working
- It's working.

01:25:25.809 --> 01:25:26.000
Summer?

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.600
- Mm-hmm? 
- Did you just fall asleep?

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.149
- Uh-huh.
- Do you know how many girls would kill

01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:36.939
for me to call them? Studios run

01:25:36.939 --> 01:25:38.379
giveaways and shit like this all the time,

01:25:38.379 --> 01:25:44.479
and million's girls would sign up.
- Girls. Not women.

01:25:45.479 --> 01:25:48.009
You know I used to want a belly button ring.

01:25:51.009 --> 01:26:02.789
I am NOT a belly button ring.
Where are you right now?

01:26:02.789 --> 01:26:13.209
Which room? 
-Yours. I hope that's okay.

01:26:13.209 --> 01:26:15.719
What are you wearing?

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:25.389
Cole Masten, I am not doing this with you. 
-I am asking purely out of

01:26:25.389 --> 01:26:28.239
concern for cocky. 
He's never seen a

01:26:28.239 --> 01:26:30.519
naked woman before. I worry about his

01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:44.689
poultry hormones.
- Poultry hormones. Cocky's just fine. 
I'm not naked.

01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.889
I'm wearing an underwear.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:58.190
- And a tank top?
- No.

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:08.930
I was hot and I'm going to sleep. 

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:18.320
- No, you shouldn't.
- Uh, this is wrong.

01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:25.289
Summer, I am a rock hard and all I can think

01:27:25.289 --> 01:27:29.250
about is you in my bed. Please, don't

01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:34.559
torture me by hanging up the phone.

01:27:34.559 --> 01:27:39.630
- You're thinking of me?
- I've been thinking about you all day.

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:54.900
I wish you're here so you can reach 
over and feel me right now.
- I've never done this before and 
I don't know what to say. 

01:27:55.900 --> 01:28:02.600
You don't have to say anything 
just touch yourself. Have you ever 
touched yourself before?

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:14.130
Oh, yes. I've been single for 3 years. 
I can cum myself to orgasm pretty quickly.

01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:49.840
I want to be with you so bad.

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:38.090
I wish it didn't end so quickly. 
I've thought about it all the time.

01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:43.370
- You have? 
- Yeah.

01:28:45.370 --> 01:28:56.760
Tomorrow night, stay at my house. 
The minute I get off that plane, 
I'll drive there, and I will pin
you down on my bed and I'll worship you.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:09.090
And I won't let you up until my mouth
imprinted on your mind and your taste 
is my middle fucking name.

01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:52.470
- It's for the movie.
- No. This is different.

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:55.300
I've known you for 13 years.

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:58.600
And how serious are you about her?
- Serious? She's my co-star.

01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:01.830
Please. Nadia's team

01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:03.060
breathing down my neck, and that

01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:05.100
Rottweiler of an attorney you tied me to

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:07.290
threatening my nuts in a jar if I so

01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:08.910
much as unzip my pants.

01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:11.660
What is this? 
Some sort of rebound or-

01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:18.210
- I wouldn't do that to her.
- To Summer?

01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:24.780
Fuck me. Are you in love?

01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:26.300
The mediation is starting soon. 
We should go.

01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:30.660
Well, who let you in? This is

01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:32.200
supposed to be a private cafe.
- Get the fuck out of here.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.420
And let me talk to my client alone.

01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:35.910
Let's just go outside and make sure no one

01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:37.500
gets in here.
- Okay.

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:42.100
I really don't want to listen 
to one of your lectures today.

01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:42.900
Mm-mhmm.

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:46.710
Was your assistant correct? 
I mean if it

01:30:46.710 --> 01:30:47.730
is something else and just let me know.

01:30:47.730 --> 01:30:50.060
We can attack it from a different side.

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:53.660
What are you talking about?

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:03.120
Walk.

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.040
I've been told to stay away 
from someone before.

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.310
Made me chase her down like she

01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:12.180
was some kind of wounded gazelle.

01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:16.380
She ended up being my soulmate.
- So now you're saying

01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:18.840
that I can date her?
- I'm saying that I need 

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.750
to know what's going on so I can control

01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:24.200
the media. 
More importantly, the judge

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.180
and Nadia's take on it. 
I can't do my job

01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:32.010
if you're keeping things from me.
- Honestly,

01:31:32.010 --> 01:31:34.200
I don't know what's going on with this girl?

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:37.990
That's the truth.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.350
Cole will get the boat, plane, 
the Montana ranch

01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:46.230
in the Fortune Bottle. 
Nadia will get the California

01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:48.510
and Hawaii real estate. 
All bank accounts

01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:50.280
will go to their respective owners with

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:54.150
joint accounts split evenly. 
Nadia do you agree

01:31:54.150 --> 01:31:57.830
with the basics of this agreement?

01:32:14.399 --> 01:32:18.599
I suppose so, yes.
Cole, do you agree with the

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:22.090
basics of this agreement?
- I do.

01:32:22.090 --> 01:32:26.500
Now, if you'll excuse me 
I have to get back to set.

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:31.999
Shooting a movie with a no-name and nobody.

01:34:29.999 --> 01:32:28.030
I guess I did hurt you more than imagined.

01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:45.840
Best of luck to you, Nadia.

01:33:18.150 --> 01:33:21.750
I can't do this.

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.020
[Music]

01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:42.900
Summer! Summer!

01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:53.000
Miss Pinkerton, it seems to me that 
you have a bit of an attitude problem.

01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:56.120
Coming to my office telling me

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:58.010
how to run my business isn't quite how

01:33:58.010 --> 01:34:00.320
we do business here at Quincy, is it?

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:08.330
I must tell you after every time you've

01:34:08.330 --> 01:34:12.920
been in here, I've felt, oh- this is

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.900
bullshit! 
Learn your marks and stay on them.

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:17.690
You've changed your marks five

01:34:17.690 --> 01:34:19.760
times in the past two hours. If you make

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:23.080
up your mind. It won't be a problem.

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.600
You touch me again, 
I'll put you in your mark

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:31.100
and hold you there.
- Cut! Okay, Summer,

01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:35.450
Cole, Let's, uh, let's take five.
Brecken, not now.

01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:37.400
We're filming. Press issues can wait.

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.950
No. No. This cannot wait.
- What's the problem?

01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:44.980
It's not with you. It was Summer.

01:34:48.579 --> 01:34:51.900
How did I not know this? 
How did we not know this?

01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:54.250
We didn't think we needed to do a full

01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:56.320
workup on her. I mean, look at her.

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.840
We ran background criminal, porn searches-

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.340
did the blood work. Everything came back

01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:06.699
clean.
- It wasn't a big deal. It was a long

01:35:06.699 --> 01:35:11.139
time ago.
- So this is something you

01:35:11.139 --> 01:35:15.730
already know about?
- My Rehearsal Dinner?

01:35:15.730 --> 01:35:20.610
No. The Rehearsal Dinner from Hell!

01:35:21.610 --> 01:35:25.929
Why didn't you tell us about this?
- Clear the room.

01:35:25.929 --> 01:35:28.139
I need to speak to Summer alone.

01:35:40.139 --> 01:35:43.719
You should have told us. 
We can control

01:35:43.719 --> 01:35:46.300
something that we know about.
This, we can't 

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:49.960
control. Right now, 
every tabloid in America

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:51.730
has somebody getting it on a plane

01:35:51.730 --> 01:35:54.639
to Quincy. 
When they get here, they're

01:35:54.639 --> 01:35:56.650
gonna find every single friend of yours,

01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:59.380
and every Chatty Cathy and talk to them.

01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:04.510
I don't care.
- You will care. You may not care

01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:06.969
right at this very second but trust me

01:36:06.969 --> 01:36:10.300
you will care.
- I have been an outcast in this

01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:16.050
town for three years. 
You think I care

01:36:16.050 --> 01:36:18.849
about what some soccer mom in Nebraska thinks

01:36:18.849 --> 01:36:21.219
of me.
- It's not just soccer moms

01:36:21.219 --> 01:36:26.000
in Nebraska. 
It's everyone in the industry.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.900
You know what I think, 
this industry is bullshit.

01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:32.600
It's the one-off thing for me. 
After this, I'm leaving.

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:35.650
You get a lead role in a feature film,

01:36:35.650 --> 01:36:39.090
and you're just gonna disappear?

01:36:41.010 --> 01:36:44.010
Yeah.

01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:52.770
You're not like any other 
woman I have ever met.

01:36:55.770 --> 01:36:57.960
Thank you.

01:36:58.290 --> 01:37:01.600
Whether you value your reputation or not

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.600
you need to talk to Brecken. 
Let her do her thing.

01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:07.500
You may have to go on a couple of talk show.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:08.999
Just tell your side of story.

01:37:08.999 --> 01:37:10.900
No. I don't want to talk about it.

01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:19.000
You don't want to talk about it on camera

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:25.230
or you don't want to talk to me?

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.060
How do you care?

01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:36.700
I need to know if I should have 
ambulances on speed dial for my crew.

01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:41.910
I'll be worried about the crew.

01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:46.200
I'd be more worried about yourself, 
Mr. Masten.

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:50.490
Don't do that.

01:37:50.490 --> 01:37:55.870
Don't call me that. Not here.

01:37:55.870 --> 01:38:02.920
Then where, Mr. Masten?

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:06.730
I'm not playing this game with you. 
I showed up for the house last night

01:38:06.730 --> 01:38:08.010
with an erection the size of Texas.

01:38:09.010 --> 01:38:12.200
And you weren't there.
- I'm here right now.

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:16.090
Not here. 
I did a half-ass job with you

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:19.550
the last time.
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:25.180
And I do care, Summer. Just stop

01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:34.000
pushing me away. 
You could use a friend right now

01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:33.000
A friend?

01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:37.309
Will you stop hating me for 
just 10 minutes and let me-

01:38:37.309 --> 01:38:39.980
I don't hate you.

01:38:43.469 --> 01:38:45.059
You liked me?
It terrifies me.

01:38:49.059 --> 01:38:52.949
Perhaps, you and I more 
similar than I thought. 

01:38:52.949 --> 01:38:56.559
We both react, rather, passionately to

01:38:56.559 --> 01:38:59.500
betrayal. 
I did try to kill a man with a

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:02.820
porcelain elephant.
- [Chuckles]

01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:18.870
Tell me what happened.

01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:23.980
It's crazy. What I did that night?

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:27.380
[Music]

01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:30.330
Three days before my wedding, I found out

01:39:30.330 --> 01:39:32.600
my fiancée was sleeping with 
my maid of honour.

01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:37.760
Turns out I was just about the
last person in town to find out.

01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:43.000
Should have called off the wedding.

01:39:43.349 --> 01:39:46.609
But I didn't. 

01:39:48.609 --> 01:39:52.500
If a kid, or stupid adult or an animal 
eats something that they shouldn't,

01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.639
they feed them Ipecac.

01:39:55.639 --> 01:40:01.550
Oh, it caused a violent vomiting 
spell that got out all the nasty.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.519
So it was very easy to set up.

01:40:04.519 --> 01:40:07.619
The restaurant was serving crème brulee

01:40:07.619 --> 01:40:12.709
for dessert, topped with a medley of berries.

01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:19.199
I like to say I hesitated 
but that'd be a lie.

01:40:20.199 --> 01:40:23.000
Two days of pent up anger,

01:40:25.499 --> 01:40:29.539
conversation with false friends.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.059
It all pushed me to my actions.

01:40:35.640 --> 01:41:13.940
[Music]

01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:16.150
[Music]

01:41:16.150 --> 01:41:33.920
[Music]

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:40.730
It was evil what I did. 
In front of everyone.

01:41:40.730 --> 01:41:44.190
Especially Quincy where appearances matter.

01:41:44.190 --> 01:41:47.910
The town never forgave me.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.600
That was my last moment of glory
and the Quincy sun.

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:55.890
You don't need them.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I know I don't.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.220
And that is why I'm taking 
my money starting a new life.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.060
That's why you asked about 
the money right away.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.960
Get out of here.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.080
One of the most appealing things 
about you, Country.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.340
Means your freedom. 
I was infuriating as it has been.

01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:30.860
You always say and act I feel.

01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:42.690
I want to propose something.
It's Friday night,

01:42:42.690 --> 01:42:45.630
We don't have to work tomorrow.

01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:50.800
Spend the night with me and for the next

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.440
24 hours,

01:42:52.440 --> 01:43:00.000
no fighting. Just us together.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.380
Okay.

01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:18.670
Cole! Summer! We need to deal with it!

01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:26.530
Tonight. My place. I'll handle this.

01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:10.320
You came.

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:12.200
Yeah.

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:20.000
I brought condoms.

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:27.000
I have condoms. Thank you.

01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:30.060
Where is your bag?

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.060
I didn't bring mine. I thought-

01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:38.870
You're staying the night.

01:44:44.530 --> 01:44:49.350
Are you hungry? 
I grilled up some steaks.

01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:53.850
- Steaks?
- We don't have to-

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.890
No. No, steaks are great.

01:44:55.890 --> 01:45:59.010
Yeah. I can make some sides.

01:45:59.010 --> 01:45:03.000
Do you like okra?

01:45:04.930 --> 01:45:07.170
Never had okra.

01:45:07.930 --> 01:46:52.170
- Oh, you're in for a treat. City boy.

01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:44.370
[Music]

01:45:44.489 --> 01:45:47.600
She definitely seems to recognize 
me when I take her treat.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:50.019
When I ask the feed store about the treats,

01:45:50.019 --> 01:45:52.439
I got laughed out of there.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
You just leave these. 
Girls come on Monday.

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:01.209
Monday? It is Friday.

01:46:01.209 --> 01:46:04.399
I'm not leaving a sink full of dirty dishes.

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:07.749
Let's just clear the food off and

01:46:07.749 --> 01:46:11.280
set the plates down on the counter.

01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:20.199
[Music]

01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:22.000
Focus.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000
How do you think this thing's going between us?

01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.000
Cole.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Come here.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:55.640
[Music]

01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:00.000
I've been dreaming of this 
moment for two months.

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:44.529
Summer. Summer.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000
I want dessert, City boy.

01:50:58.339 --> 01:51:02.510
And you for dessert.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
I want something sweet.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.199
You taste sweet.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.000
I want chocolate and whipped cream.

01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:38.300
[Laughter]

01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:47.610
I think Cocky wants to go out.

01:51:48.610 --> 01:51:51.000
Chocolate?

01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.590
You're incredible, Summer.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.320
Scott just got scared of your beauty.
Your strength.

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:06.000
And that incredible fucking mouth of yours.

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:19.320
I think he felt insecure so he choses
a woman that he felt superior to.

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:26.800
I just won't ever cheated on you.

01:52:40.650 --> 01:52:44.100
Cole, I see you.

01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:51.000
My God, you put up a lot of layers
of assholes just to keep people out.

01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:56.450
But I see the real you.

01:52:56.900 --> 01:53:20.300
It's not an asshole. It's me.

01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:09.300
No, this. This is you. 

01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:11.300
Perfect.

01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:19.300
I love this you.

01:53:20.300 --> 01:58:24.990
And I love your asshole self too.

01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:33.690
I think I'm addicted.

01:53:34.690 --> 01:53:41.710
I haven't been able to stop thinking about
your system the moment you open your door.

01:53:42.690 --> 01:53:45.000
I've been thinking about this.

01:53:50.159 --> 01:53:53.699
These. 

01:53:55.690 --> 01:54:00.710
But most of all I'm addicted to you.

01:54:02.449 --> 01:54:05.400
And I can't stop.

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:11.479
I don't think I can ever stop.

01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:41.600
Ready for Brecken's lesson to use?

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000
No. 

01:54:54.030 --> 01:55:56.639
First rule of Hollywood, babe.

01:55:56.639 --> 01:55:04.389
The gods don't ask permission. 
Be yourself and don't forget to smile.

01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:40.029
[Music]

01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:45.520
I'm assuming, since you've 
squatted yourself

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:47.050
on this personal property, 
that you know

01:55:47.050 --> 01:55:49.750
this beautiful woman beside me.

01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:51.370
But what you don't know is that she's mine.

01:55:51.370 --> 01:55:53.230
And if you fuck with her you fuck with me.

01:55:53.230 --> 01:55:57.250
And if I'm ever so lucky, ask 

01:55:57.250 --> 01:56:00.180
her to marry me, everyone here is invited.

01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:06.530
We'll be serving crème brulee 
so make sure you eat up.

01:56:07.530 --> 01:56:11.489
A joke, babe.

01:56:11.489 --> 01:56:20.820
Except for the marriage part 
because I love you.

01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:25.750
Well, look at all these visitors.

01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:27.850
Y'all hungry for some tea and biscuits?

01:56:27.850 --> 01:56:31.530
Cuz Imma bring some out lickety-split.

01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:56.440
And you're in this huge movie now.
You're just-

01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:58.330
Everything seems so-  Good luck.

01:56:58.330 --> 01:57:14.670
I'll see you at the Oscar this year. 
For sure.
- Thank you.

01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:10.270
Thank you so much. I love you. 
It's Hollywood.

01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:18.270
They're great. They're great.

01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:21.849
Did you hear The Fortune Bottle is up

01:57:21.849 --> 01:57:23.530
for several awards including Best Picture?

01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:26.300
Summer made that movie what it is. 

01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:29.349
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh I ran into Shelly and she said

01:57:29.349 --> 01:57:31.300
she think Scott and Bobbie Jo are

01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:32.280
getting a divorce.

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.809
I wouldn't be surprised if he

01:57:34.809 --> 01:57:36.579
cheated on her just like he did to our

01:57:36.579 --> 01:57:39.540
poor Summer.
