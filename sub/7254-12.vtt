00:00.681 --> 00:04.219
So the hunter comes out of the tent,
looks around, and says,

00:04.229 --> 00:07.321
"ah, very well then.
Now, where's that gorilla?"

00:07.404 --> 00:09.831
Well, now you've heard dad's big
game-hunter-and-the-gorilla joke,

00:09.861 --> 00:11.157
you're officially
part of the family.

00:11.187 --> 00:12.660
It's not too late to back out.

00:12.670 --> 00:15.572
Yes, Richard, I beg you --
get some new material.

00:15.582 --> 00:17.196
I actually like the joke,

00:17.206 --> 00:18.929
and the family is
not bad, either.

00:18.939 --> 00:20.514
Thanks for a great meal, Emily.

00:20.526 --> 00:21.810
Yes, thank you, grandma.

00:21.823 --> 00:24.139
You're quite welcome.
Did you really like the meal?

00:24.140 --> 00:25.400
It was incredible, mom.

00:25.414 --> 00:28.528
On our recent trip to Mexico, your
father and I were served quail Mazatlán,

00:28.539 --> 00:30.851
and I insisted that
Bridget find the recipe.

00:30.865 --> 00:31.753
Well, she found it.

00:31.766 --> 00:35.093
Yeah. Tell that Bridget that that
quail Mazatlán was a triumph.

00:35.107 --> 00:37.730
It's the tequila-cactus
sauce that makes it special.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.693
- So special.
- Really just great.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.581
Well, young lady,
I'll see you around the campus.

00:41.618 --> 00:42.800
Yes, you will.

00:42.817 --> 00:46.272
And Lorelai, it turns out that I have
an emergency D.A.R. board meeting

00:46.285 --> 00:48.183
on tuesday,
so I won't be able to get together

00:48.196 --> 00:50.220
to finalize the seating
chart for the party.

00:50.235 --> 00:52.260
No seating-chart get-together?
How will I live?

00:52.278 --> 00:53.451
I'll help you get through it.

00:53.467 --> 00:55.803
Christopher, are you sure
you can't stay for a cigar?

00:55.817 --> 00:57.120
Cuban. Montecristo.

00:57.138 --> 00:59.653
Perfect complement to
a tequila-cactus sauce.

00:59.667 --> 01:01.123
Dad, we really
have to get going.

01:01.136 --> 01:03.991
She's right, but maybe I
could get a Montecristo to go.

01:04.007 --> 01:05.083
Oh, nice try.

01:05.095 --> 01:06.363
I thought I'd give it a shot.

01:06.378 --> 01:08.413
Another time for cigars.
I'll see you, Rory.

01:08.427 --> 01:10.383
- Bye, grandma.
- Bye, bye.

01:10.667 --> 01:13.033
- See you in class, Rory.
- See you!

01:13.138 --> 01:14.283
Oh, my god!

01:14.295 --> 01:16.693
I thought for sure your mom
saw me put mine in here.

01:16.708 --> 01:18.822
How could so tiny a quail
have such a big, awful taste?

01:18.858 --> 01:20.521
I think the sauce burned
through my napkin.

01:20.556 --> 01:21.693
And now we just throw
it in the bushes?

01:21.726 --> 01:23.070
No! We tried that before.

01:23.085 --> 01:24.631
The chicken Kiev.
The baava, too.

01:24.646 --> 01:26.583
Yeah. The neighbor's cat find it
and dragged it to the back patio.

01:26.616 --> 01:27.520
So busted.

01:27.535 --> 01:28.652
How do we get rid of it?

01:28.665 --> 01:29.791
We take it with us in the car.

01:29.826 --> 01:31.663
And we give it the old
heave-ho over Tyler's bridge.

01:31.697 --> 01:33.792
Got to make sure we get every
piece in the water, though.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.492
Oh yeah.
One stray piece of quail Mazatlán,

01:35.528 --> 01:36.991
and grandma will have
the river dragged.

01:37.028 --> 01:40.413
We need something to weigh them down.
Hey, how attached are you to that watch?

02:53.856 --> 02:55.492
Morning!

02:56.895 --> 02:58.433
Ow! What was that for?

02:58.445 --> 02:59.782
Thought maybe I was dreaming.

02:59.795 --> 03:01.260
Then you're supposed to
ask me to pinch you.

03:01.297 --> 03:02.582
You're not supposed
to pinch me.

03:02.596 --> 03:05.430
Well, I'm confused.
I haven't even had my coffee yet.

03:05.448 --> 03:09.532
I have your coffee and
muffins hot from the oven.

03:09.546 --> 03:12.111
Well, actually, they're not really
muffins. They're muffin tops

03:12.127 --> 03:15.383
because the muffin tops are
the only parts you like.

03:15.397 --> 03:17.680
You baked me a whole
basket of muffin tops?

03:17.698 --> 03:18.701
Yep.

03:18.717 --> 03:21.631
I have got apple-cinnamon-walnut,
lemon-poppy seed,

03:21.646 --> 03:24.293
apple spice,
and double chocolate chip,

03:24.307 --> 03:26.353
which is really more
cake than muffin.

03:26.365 --> 03:29.223
But if calling them a muffin means
you can eat them in the morning,

03:29.238 --> 03:31.043
then I am all for it.

03:31.058 --> 03:34.291
So, which would you like?

03:34.307 --> 03:35.593
Um,  the cake one, please.

03:35.605 --> 03:38.062
Ooh, good choice.

03:38.397 --> 03:40.021
Ta-da.

03:40.246 --> 03:41.351
Sookie?

03:42.667 --> 03:45.171
What are you doing here?
It's not even 7:00.

03:45.187 --> 03:46.460
What?!

03:46.476 --> 03:50.023
Why can't a girl get up
super early on her day off,

03:50.038 --> 03:53.043
make some muffin tops,
and bring a hot cup of coffee

03:53.057 --> 03:58.060
over to the best friend and business
partner a girl could ever have?

03:58.075 --> 03:59.120
I guess.

03:59.137 --> 04:00.743
I mean,
I had to get up early anyway.

04:00.755 --> 04:03.603
Jackson and I are going skiing.
We're so excited.

04:03.616 --> 04:05.400
We haven't done that
since before the kids.

04:05.415 --> 04:07.462
Hmm. That's cool.

04:07.478 --> 04:09.070
Yeah, Jackson loves to ski,

04:09.087 --> 04:12.122
and I love to dress up in those
cozy clothes, the furry boots,

04:12.136 --> 04:14.570
and curl up with
a Sue Grafton mystery.

04:14.587 --> 04:18.261
I got "'R' is for 'ricochet'"
and "'S' is for 'silence.'"

04:18.507 --> 04:23.672
If the ski conditions are good, I can get
a good eight hours of Kinsey Millhone in.

04:24.066 --> 04:28.180
Yeah, we were so excited.

04:28.195 --> 04:29.730
"Were"?

04:30.435 --> 04:33.273
Our, uh,
babysitter called last night,

04:33.288 --> 04:35.012
and she's got mono.

04:35.486 --> 04:38.853
Yeah. How is that,
uh, muffin top?

04:38.866 --> 04:41.850
It has the faintest
aftertaste of bribe.

04:41.866 --> 04:44.802
I know it's a lot of work to
take care of the kids, and...

04:44.817 --> 04:47.992
and I know that it's your day off, too,
but I would really, really appreciate it,

04:48.027 --> 04:51.352
and I would really,
really, really owe you big.

04:51.366 --> 04:53.191
I'd love to take care
of Davey and Martha.

04:53.205 --> 04:56.193
Oh, did I happen to mention
that you're the best friend

04:56.208 --> 04:58.293
and business partner a
girl could ever have?

04:58.308 --> 04:59.552
I believe you led with that.

04:59.567 --> 05:02.743
Oh, good, because you are.
Thank you.

05:02.758 --> 05:05.373
No problem.
God, this coffee is good.

05:05.387 --> 05:07.280
Well, yeah, it should be.

05:07.317 --> 05:10.052
I got it from Luke's.

05:10.068 --> 05:11.682
Sorry. Is that weird?

05:11.696 --> 05:13.973
Oh, no, that's not weird.

05:13.988 --> 05:15.163
Good.

05:15.177 --> 05:16.841
I mean, it shouldn't be weird.

05:16.857 --> 05:18.223
No, it shouldn't be weird.

05:18.237 --> 05:21.422
It would be weird if I intentionally
didn't drink the coffee.

05:21.438 --> 05:23.921
- That would be weird.
- Yeah, that would be weird.

05:23.936 --> 05:25.293
I mean, it's good coffee.

05:25.307 --> 05:27.940
Yeah, and there's no reason you
shouldn't enjoy good coffee.

05:27.958 --> 05:29.683
- Exactly.
- Good.

05:29.695 --> 05:31.522
Yeah, so it's not weird.

05:31.617 --> 05:33.471
What did you do with
the muffin bottoms?

05:33.488 --> 05:35.230
I made a muffin-bottom pie.

05:35.248 --> 05:37.403
It's actually pretty good.
I'm thinking about patenting it.

05:37.437 --> 05:39.712
Mmm, muffin-bottom pie --
sounds dirty.

05:39.727 --> 05:42.162
Mm-mmm! There are
baked goods in here.

05:42.177 --> 05:43.833
At first I thought
I was dreaming.

05:43.847 --> 05:45.772
- Please don't pinch me.
- When I realized I wasn't,

05:45.808 --> 05:48.270
I thought, "somebody must've
broke in here and started baking."

05:48.308 --> 05:50.672
Baking and entering --
it's a crime wave sweeping the nation.

05:50.705 --> 05:52.051
Just not used to that smell.

05:52.066 --> 05:54.562
Well, enjoy.
Sookie brought us coffee

05:54.577 --> 05:57.240
- and freshly baked muffin tops. 
- Muffin tops?

05:57.258 --> 05:59.153
- They are the best part.
- Okay.

05:59.165 --> 06:01.961
You got to be careful, though,
because they induce a sugar coma

06:01.976 --> 06:04.751
where it makes you say,
"yes, yes, anything, yes."

06:04.768 --> 06:06.630
I needed her to babysit today.

06:06.646 --> 06:08.381
- You need anything from me?
- Nope.

06:08.397 --> 06:10.722
Then we're good to go.
Actually, this is gonna work out well.

06:10.758 --> 06:12.792
Ship the daughter unit
off to her grandmother,

06:12.807 --> 06:15.210
get rid of the wife unit,
leaving the husband unit free

06:15.228 --> 06:17.582
to do some good,
old-fashioned manual labor.

06:17.595 --> 06:18.940
He's  putting up a flat-screen.

06:18.955 --> 06:20.701
Oh, flat-screen what?

06:20.716 --> 06:22.292
Come on. Are you serious?

06:22.407 --> 06:23.433
TV.

06:23.448 --> 06:24.790
- Oh.
- Yeah.

06:24.803 --> 06:26.859
You'll see.
You're gonna love it.

06:26.860 --> 06:28.900
Well, I should get going.

06:28.914 --> 06:30.668
I have to get ready for skiing.

06:30.759 --> 06:32.693
Oh, hey,
do you have any magazines

06:32.706 --> 06:34.850
in case I get through
both "R" and "S"?

06:34.868 --> 06:36.600
- Yeah, on the hall table.
- Okay, great.

06:36.616 --> 06:38.722
I'll get them on the way out.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.783
Thank you, Lorelai.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.400
I really, really appreciate it.

06:44.417 --> 06:45.440
It's okay.

06:45.456 --> 06:50.560
No, I mean, it takes a special
person to, you know, on her day off.

06:50.887 --> 06:53.022
- No problem.
- Okay.

06:53.116 --> 06:55.600
Look what you're making me do.

06:55.658 --> 06:57.901
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye. Okay.

06:59.616 --> 07:00.740
- Okay.
- Bye.

07:00.755 --> 07:02.151
- Bye.
- Bye, Sookie.

07:04.307 --> 07:05.983
- What was that?
- I don't know.

07:05.995 --> 07:08.851
She's really excited about
her skiing/reading trip.

07:10.516 --> 07:12.290
This is good coffee.

07:12.355 --> 07:13.932
It is good.

07:13.945 --> 07:15.590
It's from Luke's.

07:18.658 --> 07:20.542
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

07:20.557 --> 07:22.930
Sookie brought it.
Are you sure?

07:22.945 --> 07:24.261
Of course.

07:24.458 --> 07:25.970
Why wouldn't it be?

07:25.985 --> 07:27.490
Because.

07:28.137 --> 07:29.600
It's fine.

07:30.496 --> 07:31.852
Okay.

07:32.337 --> 07:34.222
So, what do you do with
the muffin bottoms?

07:34.235 --> 07:36.270
Oh, she turned them into a pie,
you know?

07:36.286 --> 07:39.100
She's like an indian.
They use all the parts of the buffalo.

07:39.115 --> 07:41.180
I don't fully
understand that woman.

07:41.197 --> 07:42.832
She bakes good stuff.

07:42.848 --> 07:44.330
That I get.

08:13.975 --> 08:16.002
Oh, my god,
The Eagle Has Landed.

08:16.018 --> 08:18.040
Yep, they delivered it while
you were in the shower.

08:18.078 --> 08:19.382
Did they deliver
it or throw it?

08:19.398 --> 08:21.693
Comes with a lot of equipment.
Isn't it beautiful?

08:21.705 --> 08:23.240
Yeah. And big.

08:23.256 --> 08:25.701
All the better to watch Reggie
Bush score touchdowns on.

08:25.715 --> 08:28.230
I forget. Which one of the
Bush daughters is Reggie?

08:28.245 --> 08:29.871
You're gonna love it.

08:29.888 --> 08:31.253
Hey, have you seen the level?

08:31.267 --> 08:33.320
The thing with the green bubble
that goes back and forth?

08:33.356 --> 08:33.990
Yeah.

08:34.008 --> 08:35.581
Yeah, Paul Anka and I
were playing with it.

08:35.615 --> 08:36.990
You were playing with
it with the dog?

08:37.025 --> 08:39.773
Yes. I was trying to 
hypnotize him with the bubble,

08:39.784 --> 08:41.741
see if I could talk him
out of the habit of chewing

08:41.775 --> 08:42.991
on the corner of
the welcome mat,

08:43.028 --> 08:45.472
or I was gonna give him a
wacky posthypnotic suggestion,

08:45.485 --> 08:47.921
like the doorbell rings,
and he spins around in circles.

08:47.938 --> 08:49.212
Were you able to hypnotize him?

08:49.225 --> 08:50.761
No, Chris, he's a dog.

08:50.775 --> 08:54.473
All right. I think you've got this under
control. I'm gonna go sit on some babies.

08:54.485 --> 08:57.112
You do that. When you get back,
we'll sprawl out on the couch

08:57.126 --> 08:58.990
and  watch flat-screen
plasma TV,

08:59.005 --> 09:01.610
and the world as you know
it will never be the same.

09:02.095 --> 09:03.793
- You smell good.
- Yeah?

09:04.545 --> 09:05.991
Familiar.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.702
Is that my conditioner?

09:07.716 --> 09:09.242
Maybe. I don't know.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.961
Are you using my conditioner?

09:10.975 --> 09:12.850
Sometimes. Why?
You don't like to share?

09:12.868 --> 09:14.360
No, I'm married now.
I love to share.

09:14.377 --> 09:15.460
So, why is it so funny?

09:15.475 --> 09:17.382
Because you don't have
that much to condition.

09:17.398 --> 09:18.522
I know that, but --

09:18.536 --> 09:20.342
It's just been really
unruly lately?

09:20.357 --> 09:21.932
All right.
I got work to do here.

09:21.948 --> 09:24.882
All right, listen,
I love that you're using my conditioner,

09:24.896 --> 09:27.910
and I love that you're putting up this
Jumbotron thingy all by yourself,

09:27.927 --> 09:30.430
and I can't wait to come home
and watch flat sports with you,

09:30.447 --> 09:31.581
and I love you -- goodbye.

09:31.596 --> 09:32.653
I will be here.

09:32.665 --> 09:35.800
Hey, if you feel like shaving, I've got
a brand-new lady schick in the drawer.

09:35.818 --> 09:36.733
Feel free to use it.

09:36.747 --> 09:38.452
Oh, I might just do that.

09:42.158 --> 09:43.901
Danes vs. Nardini?

09:43.918 --> 09:45.103
Custody case.

09:45.117 --> 09:47.582
Oh, yeah, right.
Uh, no, Nardini is not here.

09:47.598 --> 09:48.873
Nobody is here.

09:48.887 --> 09:52.133
I mean, well,
nobody from -- okay.

09:52.466 --> 09:53.453
Luke.

09:53.465 --> 09:55.183
Oh, hey, Jim. Hey.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.351
- Been waiting long?
- No, no, no, I got here early.

09:57.365 --> 10:00.702
I wasn't sure where I was supposed
to park, so I got here early.

10:00.717 --> 10:02.561
- Always a good idea.
- Yeah, listen, uh...

10:02.575 --> 10:06.232
I meant to ask you --
will I start with a statement?

10:06.248 --> 10:08.790
No, no,
you won't start with any statement.

10:08.805 --> 10:09.640
Okay.

10:09.658 --> 10:12.081
Actually, the less you say,
the better,

10:12.095 --> 10:16.791
which is good because the more you say,
the more they can, well, you know.

10:16.807 --> 10:20.201
Right, right. Will they make a
decision right away? Do they tell us?

10:20.216 --> 10:22.720
Listen, I got to make a quick call.
Give me a sec?

10:22.736 --> 10:24.661
Oh, yeah, no. Go.
Go right ahead.

10:30.375 --> 10:31.900
Oh, hey.

10:32.158 --> 10:33.543
Hello, Luke.

10:33.595 --> 10:36.242
They're not -- we're not --

10:36.257 --> 10:38.060
Oh, are we early?

10:38.078 --> 10:40.791
Yeah, I guess,
or they're behind.

10:53.557 --> 10:55.263
Did you park in the garage?

10:55.275 --> 10:58.510
Yeah, do I get this
thing stamped or what?

10:58.527 --> 11:00.621
I don't know.
I didn't park in the garage.

11:00.636 --> 11:02.022
Oh. Okay.

11:09.317 --> 11:11.022
Man, this place, huh?

11:11.038 --> 11:12.561
Yeah, what a waste of time.

11:12.578 --> 11:13.671
Yeah.

11:13.686 --> 11:15.853
Especially  since there's
no reason for it.

11:15.868 --> 11:17.360
Well, I mean...

11:17.376 --> 11:19.953
But you have to finish
what you started, right?

11:19.965 --> 11:21.540
What I started?

11:21.557 --> 11:23.942
Yes, when you hired a lawyer.

11:23.956 --> 11:27.100
Well, I had to hire a lawyer.
It was the only way I could see my kid.

11:27.805 --> 11:30.691
I mean, come on.
You really think you have a chance?

11:30.706 --> 11:33.431
Yeah, well,
that's for a judge to decide.

11:33.445 --> 11:36.363
Well, step back.
Take a look at it.

11:36.556 --> 11:39.130
I mean, look at yourself.
You're... you --

11:39.147 --> 11:43.841
a hermit living above a diner in
some old, converted hardware store.

11:43.858 --> 11:47.201
It doesn't exactly paint a
picture of "capable father."

11:47.217 --> 11:49.272
It doesn't matter where I live,

11:49.286 --> 11:52.122
and I have been nothing
but a good father to April.

11:52.135 --> 11:55.742
And you're not gonna get any points
for your history with women, either.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.732
I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:57.745 --> 12:00.432
Bailed on Lorelai,
got divorced in a heartbeat.

12:00.445 --> 12:02.943
I did not bail on Lorelai.

12:02.955 --> 12:06.230
You have had no long-term
relationships, Luke.

12:06.247 --> 12:09.701
Why would a judge trust
you to have one with April?

12:09.715 --> 12:12.692
April -- huh! -- knows --

12:12.705 --> 12:14.893
Hi. Anna, all set?

12:14.908 --> 12:16.352
Hello, Barbara.

12:16.365 --> 12:17.691
Jim.

12:17.707 --> 12:19.172
Can we go in?

12:19.187 --> 12:20.872
The judge is ready for you.

12:20.887 --> 12:22.492
Perfect timing.

12:34.986 --> 12:36.261
- Hey, Paris.
- Hey, Rory.

12:36.278 --> 12:37.700
Just a second.
I'm in the middle of something.

12:37.736 --> 12:39.623
- Did you have a good --
- Shh! No.

12:39.637 --> 12:43.152
I have to set up that Goldman Sachs
interview before spring break.

12:44.535 --> 12:47.833
My Christmas was fine, thank you.
I assume yours was, too?

12:47.848 --> 12:49.501
It was nice.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.152
Good. We've got the pleasantries
out of the way. Can we move on?

12:52.168 --> 12:54.873
I hope so.
I am emotionally spent.

12:54.887 --> 12:56.051
What's all this?

12:56.066 --> 13:00.491
This is the game plan for what
I call operation finish line.

13:00.508 --> 13:01.953
- Need more.
- Okay.

13:01.968 --> 13:03.691
We only have five months
left before we leave

13:03.726 --> 13:05.721
the warm and comforting
bosom of this university

13:05.735 --> 13:08.153
and face the bitterly cold
shoulder of the real world.

13:08.166 --> 13:10.061
- "We"?
- You and I.

13:10.077 --> 13:12.320
You're the green marker.
Green was a random choice,

13:12.336 --> 13:16.003
not a subtle comment about how inexperienced
you are with real-life matters.

13:16.017 --> 13:17.791
Then again, maybe it was.

13:18.926 --> 13:21.683
So I applying for an
oceanography fellowship?

13:21.697 --> 13:25.670
And I might point out that the application
is due by february 28.

13:25.687 --> 13:27.221
But I know nothing
about oceanography.

13:27.235 --> 13:29.032
I can't even tell you which
direction the ocean is.

13:29.067 --> 13:31.903
You apply, you get the fellowship,
then you decide if you want it.

13:31.917 --> 13:33.171
I already know I don't want it.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.692
It's a defensive move.
It's like monopoly.

13:35.706 --> 13:37.823
Your little wheelbarrow lands on St.
James place.

13:37.837 --> 13:40.250
You think, "I don't really want
St. James place, but I don't want

13:40.267 --> 13:42.991
some other schmo to get it,
so I'll stick a plastic house there."

13:43.005 --> 13:44.173
Am I getting through to you?

13:44.185 --> 13:45.901
You're making me want
to play monopoly.

13:45.915 --> 13:48.471
Look, come the semester's end,
you're gonna thank me for this chart.

13:48.507 --> 13:50.282
We cannot graduate unprepared.

13:50.298 --> 13:53.432
Paris, there is no way we're gonna
have time to do all this stuff.

13:53.445 --> 13:56.660
I'm not saying it's not gonna be
time-consuming, but there's two of us,

13:56.677 --> 13:59.191
so we'll divide it all up and
report back to each other.

13:59.207 --> 14:01.182
I think we should have
weekly report-back sessions.

14:01.217 --> 14:02.872
How about friday
afternoons at 5:00?

14:02.887 --> 14:05.483
There's something to look forward
to at the end of the week.

14:15.107 --> 14:17.273
- Jackson!
- One minute.

14:17.287 --> 14:19.643
- Jackson, get the door!
- One minute!

14:19.657 --> 14:21.082
That's okay. I'm fine.

14:21.095 --> 14:22.280
Get the door!

14:22.295 --> 14:24.173
Getting it, getting it.

14:24.896 --> 14:26.430
- Sorry, Lorelai.
- That's okay.

14:26.446 --> 14:29.732
I just put Martha down for a nap,
and Sookie is getting dressed.

14:30.616 --> 14:32.481
She's picking out
an outfit now.

14:32.495 --> 14:33.773
Thanks again for doing this.

14:33.787 --> 14:36.002
Sure. So, where is Davey?

14:36.018 --> 14:38.962
I don't know.
I haven't seen him all day long.

14:38.975 --> 14:40.860
That's too bad. I brought over
something special for him,

14:40.898 --> 14:43.160
but if he's not here,
I guess I'll just take it back home.

14:43.177 --> 14:44.102
No!

14:44.118 --> 14:47.111
Oh, there you are. Here you go.
Check out what's in my bag.

14:47.127 --> 14:48.202
So, how's Christopher?

14:48.218 --> 14:50.973
Oh, he's good. He's putting up a
ginormous flat-screen as we speak.

14:50.985 --> 14:52.961
Cool. What's the
pixel aspect ratio?

14:52.976 --> 14:54.802
- It's got two remotes.
- I'll ask him.

14:54.815 --> 14:56.330
Good idea. Hey.

14:56.408 --> 14:57.980
Do you like this sweater on me?

14:57.998 --> 14:59.521
Yeah, honey, it's great.

14:59.535 --> 15:01.712
I don't like it.
I'm gonna change.

15:02.407 --> 15:04.892
So, the four of us should 
go out sometime soon.

15:04.908 --> 15:05.742
Sounds good.

15:05.757 --> 15:07.833
I mean, I was gonna ask you
two to join us next week

15:07.836 --> 15:09.471
in Woodbury for
couples-bowling night,

15:09.487 --> 15:11.432
but you don't really seem like
the couples-bowling type.

15:11.466 --> 15:13.180
Why? What's the
couples-bowling type?

15:13.197 --> 15:15.330
I don't know,
sort of boring married people.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.153
But I am a boring
married person now.

15:17.168 --> 15:19.171
-  Do you even like bowling?
- Not when I was single,

15:19.207 --> 15:21.973
but maybe now that I'm boring and
married, it would be right up my alley.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.931
- You have to wear the shoes.
- Forget it.

15:23.945 --> 15:26.421
- How about this?
- Ooh, that I really like.

15:26.435 --> 15:29.511
That's nice,
the style and the color.

15:29.608 --> 15:32.100
No, it's all wrong.
I'm gonna change.

15:32.997 --> 15:34.091
Is she okay?

15:34.107 --> 15:36.430
Sookie? Um, yeah, she's fine.

15:36.447 --> 15:38.570
So, buddy,
what did Lorelai bring?

15:38.585 --> 15:40.332
Her magic socks.

15:40.346 --> 15:44.051
I could tell you what they do, but it's
kind of private between me and Davey.

15:44.507 --> 15:45.882
Oh, yeah.

15:45.897 --> 15:48.890
That's perfect --
perfect, perfect, perfect. Let's go.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.221
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

15:50.238 --> 15:51.821
Kinsey Millhone is
waiting for you.

15:51.836 --> 15:53.173
You don't think it's
a little too --

15:53.208 --> 15:56.203
No, I love that sweater.
Don't you, Lorelai?

15:56.215 --> 15:57.712
Yes, I love, love, love it.

15:57.728 --> 15:59.490
Great. See?
Everything is great.

15:59.506 --> 16:01.390
See you later, buddy.
Thanks again for doing this.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.232
- Come on. Let's go.
- I can't leave them.

16:03.248 --> 16:05.563
- You can.
- No, I can't. They need me.

16:05.576 --> 16:07.460
They're going to be fine.
Come on. Let's go.

16:07.476 --> 16:09.692
Don't you want mommy to stay
here and play with you?

16:09.708 --> 16:11.060
Wouldn't that be fun?

16:11.077 --> 16:13.832
Come on. Let's go hit those
slopes and crack those books.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.352
- Thanks again, Lorelai.
- Okay. Bye.

16:16.648 --> 16:19.261
All right. Come here. Let's see
your magic socks. Let's see 'em.

16:19.277 --> 16:20.871
Come here.
Where do you want to go?

16:20.887 --> 16:22.433
- The jungle.
- The jungle?

16:22.446 --> 16:25.661
You better start kicking.
Start kicking to get to the jungle.

16:25.677 --> 16:27.322
Kick! Kick!

16:27.336 --> 16:29.451
You got to kick to get there.

16:35.066 --> 16:38.403
Don't apologize, Connor. That's
precisely why I have office hours.

16:38.418 --> 16:41.863
Oh, and I'm supposed to tell you
that you can also query me by email,

16:41.877 --> 16:46.612
although to be honest, I check it about
as often as I do the Daily Racing Form.

16:47.096 --> 16:48.210
Thanks.

16:48.225 --> 16:49.421
Yeah.

16:50.867 --> 16:53.331
Miss Gilmore,
I believe you're next.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.862
The visiting lecturer
will see you now.

16:54.897 --> 16:56.171
Thank you.

16:59.266 --> 17:01.902
Oh, I like your office.
It's cozy.

17:01.918 --> 17:03.850
That's one way to
describing it.

17:03.867 --> 17:07.281
So, have you come as a loving
granddaughter visiting your grandfather

17:07.296 --> 17:10.931
or as an obsequious student trying
to butter up her professor?

17:10.946 --> 17:12.310
Well, I'm not buttering up.

17:12.326 --> 17:13.733
Oh, good.

17:13.746 --> 17:15.612
Well, actually --

17:15.627 --> 17:17.732
Oh, I thought I smelled butter.

17:17.746 --> 17:20.001
You know my, uh,
roommate, Paris?

17:20.018 --> 17:21.810
Oh, I've met Paris.

17:21.828 --> 17:24.050
Well, and you don't
have to do this,

17:24.068 --> 17:27.593
but she wanted me to ask you if
you might be able to help her

17:27.605 --> 17:31.322
to set up an informal
get-together with Dean Kerrigan.

17:31.335 --> 17:32.713
To what end?

17:32.726 --> 17:36.782
I think she wants some kind of
recommendation for after graduation.

17:36.797 --> 17:38.063
I see.

17:38.078 --> 17:41.000
And I guess it wouldn't hurt
for me to meet him, as well.

17:41.275 --> 17:42.840
But you don't have to.

17:42.857 --> 17:44.791
I suppose I could
speak to Dean Kerrigan.

17:44.806 --> 17:46.411
He's an affable gentleman.

17:46.426 --> 17:49.122
He's probably not averse to getting
together for wine and cheese

17:49.138 --> 17:52.723
and meeting a pair of bright,
soon-to-be graduates. I'll look into it.

17:52.735 --> 17:55.821
Really? Okay. Thanks, grandpa.

17:55.835 --> 17:59.021
So, I'm looking forward to
having you in class again.

17:59.037 --> 17:59.943
Me too.

17:59.958 --> 18:03.520
I think you'll find this class more
stimulating than last semester's.

18:03.536 --> 18:05.750
I'm expanding on some
economic principles here,

18:05.768 --> 18:08.960
like pricing strategies under
varying economic conditions

18:08.975 --> 18:12.890
that can be actually
useful to -- sorry.

18:13.786 --> 18:16.590
I shouldn't bore you until
you're sitting in my class,

18:16.605 --> 18:18.002
getting credit for it.

18:18.017 --> 18:20.342
No, I'm not bored.
I'm sorry, grandpa.

18:20.356 --> 18:22.430
I just have a lot off my mind.

18:22.447 --> 18:24.172
Is everything all right?

18:24.277 --> 18:26.392
I just -- It's senior year,

18:26.408 --> 18:28.663
you know, last semester.

18:28.678 --> 18:30.791
There's charts all
over my apartment,

18:30.807 --> 18:33.543
and I'm going through
something with a friend, so --

18:33.556 --> 18:36.272
- Paris?
- No, someone else.

18:36.476 --> 18:41.542
I hurt her feelings, and even after
writing her a very long letter of apology,

18:41.558 --> 18:45.513
she hasn't gotten back to me,
and I just feel terrible.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.963
I see.

18:47.075 --> 18:49.390
Well, I doubt it's as
bad as you think it is.

18:49.406 --> 18:51.411
I'm sure the girl
will get back to you.

18:51.427 --> 18:54.161
Maybe she's just a
very slow reader.

18:55.756 --> 18:58.810
Oh, honey,
anybody who knows you

18:58.828 --> 19:02.273
knows you would never do anything to
purposely hurt someone's feelings.

19:02.287 --> 19:04.902
That's just it.
We don't know each other that well.

19:04.915 --> 19:07.532
She's a new friend.
We don't have a history.

19:09.185 --> 19:11.261
Well, I wouldn't
worry about it.

19:12.035 --> 19:16.210
Rory, you're a person
of great heart

19:16.228 --> 19:18.193
and great character.

19:18.208 --> 19:21.532
And that combination
will always win the day.

19:22.556 --> 19:24.283
I hope so.

19:25.326 --> 19:29.851
So, can I interest
you in syllabus?

19:38.936 --> 19:40.381
I was just trying
to be helpful.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.120
Cut it out. You're bugging me.

19:42.138 --> 19:44.901
Hi. Wow, you're home early.

19:44.915 --> 19:46.412
I'm sorry it's such a mess.

19:46.426 --> 19:48.681
Um, the magic socks
took us back in time.

19:48.698 --> 19:51.732
We were cavemen. It was really bleak,
so we lived like this.

19:51.747 --> 19:53.580
I would've cleaned up,
but when they woke up,

19:53.596 --> 19:56.202
the magic socks were gonna take
us to an orphanage in England

19:56.217 --> 20:00.092
where they had to tidy up in
exchange for one teaspoon of gruel.

20:00.106 --> 20:01.350
Sounds fun.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.612
Don't worry about the mess.

20:02.625 --> 20:04.812
So, how was the skiing/reading?

20:04.828 --> 20:06.463
Oh, uh, terrible.

20:06.477 --> 20:08.852
Oh, come on.
You had fun all morning.

20:08.868 --> 20:10.553
I could've had fun all day.

20:10.567 --> 20:13.310
We meet up for lunch. He spills
my hot toddy all over the table,

20:13.326 --> 20:14.930
and he won't let me
order another one.

20:14.946 --> 20:16.523
- "Let you"?
- Yeah, let me.

20:16.535 --> 20:18.372
He said if I ordered another one,
he'd just do it again.

20:18.407 --> 20:21.010
I just don't think drinking
is appropriate at lunch.

20:21.048 --> 20:22.473
It was one drink.

20:22.486 --> 20:24.421
Sometimes that's all it takes.

20:24.436 --> 20:26.131
And he wouldn't let me ski.

20:26.148 --> 20:28.012
- You mean read?
- No. Ski.

20:28.025 --> 20:30.141
"'S' is for 'silent'" sucked,
so I thought,

20:30.158 --> 20:33.153
"why don't I strap on some skis
and try a little downhill?"

20:33.168 --> 20:35.523
This one wouldn't let me.

20:35.537 --> 20:38.203
Conditions were terrible.
It was really icy.

20:38.215 --> 20:40.481
Well, apparently you make all the rules,
your highness.

20:40.495 --> 20:43.292
Could I go check on my children?
Could I do that, huh?

20:43.308 --> 20:45.532
No, that's fine. Sounds good.

20:49.018 --> 20:50.983
So, thanks a lot for sitting.

20:50.997 --> 20:52.820
We really appreciate it.

20:53.618 --> 20:55.982
Jackson, seriously,
what's going on with you two?

20:55.996 --> 20:57.422
Nothing much. You?

20:57.435 --> 21:00.360
Jackson, why wouldn't
you let her drink?

21:00.378 --> 21:02.733
- It's a bad precedent.
- Or ski?

21:02.746 --> 21:04.901
I didn't want her to get hurt.

21:04.918 --> 21:06.753
There's all these snowboarders
on the hill these days,

21:06.788 --> 21:08.442
and they just come
tearing down --

21:08.458 --> 21:10.830
Jackson, what is
going on with you two?

21:10.845 --> 21:12.071
Nothing.

21:12.088 --> 21:14.670
- You're acting strange.
- No, I'm not.

21:14.688 --> 21:17.180
So is Sookie.
She's all weird and moody.

21:17.196 --> 21:18.702
The last time she was like that,
she was pregnant.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.151
- What?
- What?

21:20.167 --> 21:21.323
- What?
- No.

21:21.338 --> 21:22.551
- No.
- No

21:22.568 --> 21:23.613
Maybe?

21:23.625 --> 21:25.320
Jackson, I thought
you got a vasectomy.

21:25.337 --> 21:26.962
Oh, so she says,
"go get a vasectomy,"

21:26.976 --> 21:28.652
and I'm just supposed
to go get a vactomy?

21:28.666 --> 21:30.132
No, you shouldn't do it if
you didn't want to do it,

21:30.167 --> 21:32.221
but if you didn't want to do it, you
should've told her you didn't want to do it.

21:32.258 --> 21:33.773
I didn't see the point.

21:33.786 --> 21:35.933
- Now I see the point.
- Jackson.

21:35.945 --> 21:39.033
She said she was staying on the pill.
She said it gave her skin a healthy glow.

21:39.066 --> 21:40.472
Yeah, she went
off it last month.

21:40.485 --> 21:42.063
I know that now.

21:42.076 --> 21:43.933
You'd think that's the kind of
thing a wife would tell her husband.

21:43.965 --> 21:45.501
Not when she thinks the
husband had a vasectomy.

21:45.535 --> 21:46.501
I know. I know.

21:46.517 --> 21:48.173
Jackson, you have to
tell her she's pregnant.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.672
I was going to today
after we had a great time

21:50.688 --> 21:51.752
and she was in a great mood,

21:51.788 --> 21:53.403
but then she wanted
to ski and drink.

21:53.417 --> 21:55.333
- Well, you wouldn't let her.
- She's pregnant.

21:55.346 --> 21:56.501
I know that and you know that,

21:56.537 --> 21:58.743
but don't you think Sookie should
be let in on the good news?

21:58.778 --> 22:00.333
All right, all right.

22:00.347 --> 22:02.831
- Good luck.
- Yeah. Thanks.

22:06.937 --> 22:09.211
Honey? Honey?

22:16.845 --> 22:17.933
No!

22:17.945 --> 22:20.643
You can't just order someone
to go get a vasectomy...

22:20.658 --> 22:23.810
You know what?
J-Just be really quiet right now!

22:23.825 --> 22:25.210
...like it's a haircut.

22:25.225 --> 22:27.091
Don't speak. Don't breathe.

22:27.105 --> 22:29.512
Don't even look at me.
I'm gonna go for a walk,

22:29.525 --> 22:32.222
and while I'm gone,
you're gonna have that taken care of.

22:32.235 --> 22:33.900
- But --
- No. No talking.

22:33.916 --> 22:36.393
Just do it,
or when get home, I will.

22:36.408 --> 22:38.152
Lorelai, let's go!

22:43.376 --> 22:45.951
As we all know, your honor,
custody cases must center

22:45.965 --> 22:48.121
on what's in the best
interest of the child.

22:48.135 --> 22:49.893
And as we all know,

22:49.905 --> 22:52.893
"best interest" is
a subjective term.

22:52.907 --> 22:55.900
For Mr. Danes to have as much
access to April as he's seeking

22:55.917 --> 22:58.272
would certainly not be
in her best interest.

22:58.287 --> 23:00.201
To deny the child
access to her father

23:00.217 --> 23:01.910
would be
psychologically damaging.

23:01.926 --> 23:05.311
Why? The child has only seen Mr.
Danes on sporadic occasions

23:05.325 --> 23:08.161
whenever he found time in his
schedule to allow her to visit.

23:08.177 --> 23:11.631
He made himself available to
her as often as she liked.

23:11.648 --> 23:13.523
Truth be told,
during the past year,

23:13.538 --> 23:15.633
April has spent more
cumulative hours

23:15.648 --> 23:19.362
with the man who drives her
school bus than with Luke Danes.

23:19.376 --> 23:23.161
Why don't we ask my client to allow the
bus driver shared custody of the child?

23:23.176 --> 23:24.770
Bit of a stretch there,
miss Campbell.

23:24.786 --> 23:26.780
My point, your honor,
is that April's connection

23:26.796 --> 23:29.953
to Mr.
Danes is superficial at best.

23:29.966 --> 23:32.180
To her,
he's a man who works in a diner

23:32.198 --> 23:35.391
who only recently revealed
himself to be her father.

23:35.407 --> 23:38.280
Owns. I own the diner.

23:38.297 --> 23:41.140
I don't just work there,
and April came to me.

23:41.158 --> 23:42.730
Yeah, without my knowing it.

23:42.748 --> 23:45.301
Exactly. You had no intention of
letting me know I had a daughter.

23:45.335 --> 23:46.530
Excuse me.

23:46.546 --> 23:48.731
I suggest you let your
attorneys speak for you.

23:48.745 --> 23:51.670
It is why you pay them all
your hard-earned money.

23:51.895 --> 23:53.801
I apologize, your honor.

23:53.815 --> 23:55.862
Yeah. Sorry.

23:56.745 --> 24:00.081
I just -- and he really --
ohh! You know?

24:00.095 --> 24:04.513
And he didn't, and then I-I
can't believe that he -- ohh!

24:04.527 --> 24:06.833
Ooh! You know, 'cause he didn't have --
He didn't.

24:06.845 --> 24:08.661
And I can't believe
that he could've.

24:08.675 --> 24:10.811
You know you can't walk
off a pregnancy, right?

24:10.826 --> 24:12.990
I had just delivered his baby,
and then what?

24:13.007 --> 24:14.860
I'm supposed to go and
hold my husband's hand

24:14.876 --> 24:17.161
while he get's a vasectomy
to make sure he does?

24:17.176 --> 24:19.183
No. It's too much.

24:19.196 --> 24:22.081
I mean, I-I-I'm not his mother.
I'm already a mother.

24:22.096 --> 24:25.213
I don't have the time
to baby a grown man.

24:25.228 --> 24:26.293
I know.

24:26.305 --> 24:28.673
What am I supposed to do --
start watching him brush his teeth?

24:28.706 --> 24:30.123
Does he want me to
start cutting his meat?

24:30.157 --> 24:32.020
I don't think he wants
his meat cut at all.

24:32.035 --> 24:33.742
Well, how could he do this?

24:33.755 --> 24:36.092
I guess he didn't really
want to have a vasectomy.

24:36.107 --> 24:37.563
- Well, then, tell me.
- I agree.

24:37.575 --> 24:40.502
- Uhh!
- I know. Uhh!

24:40.515 --> 24:43.462
I didn't --
There was less than 4,000 left.

24:43.475 --> 24:45.863
- 4,000?
- Diapers, diapers.

24:45.875 --> 24:49.190
For the last year and a half,
I've been changing 20 diapers a day,

24:49.208 --> 24:52.881
and finally --
finally I've got Davey.

24:52.895 --> 24:55.301
He's potty-trained. It's good.

24:55.316 --> 24:58.222
Martha has always gone
through a little more.

24:58.235 --> 25:00.053
I mean, girls --
it's a boy-girl thing. I don't know.

25:00.086 --> 25:02.831
Boys seem to be perfectly happy
sitting in their own filth.

25:02.845 --> 25:03.793
I didn't know that.

25:03.807 --> 25:06.232
Yeah, and Martha is
12 diapers a day.

25:06.246 --> 25:08.173
And then if you add the --
but that's not the point.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.642
The point is that there was a
light at the end of the tunnel,

25:10.657 --> 25:13.643
and now the light at the end of the
tunnel is no more because you can't
do that

25:13.677 --> 25:16.331
with 23 diapers a day. 26.

25:16.347 --> 25:18.352
If it's a girl,
that's 26 diapers a day.

25:18.367 --> 25:20.612
You could use cloth diapers, you know?
You wash them and --

25:20.645 --> 25:24.002
That's not the point. That's not the
point. I get it. That's a lot of diapers.

25:24.016 --> 25:26.622
But you know,
babies are more than diapers, right?

25:26.637 --> 25:28.792
- No, no.
- Sookie.

25:28.805 --> 25:30.910
No, all I remember is eat,
sleep, poop.

25:30.928 --> 25:32.401
Well, there's other stuff.

25:32.415 --> 25:36.043
Yeah, like diaper rash and
colic and potty-training.

25:36.055 --> 25:37.353
No, the good stuff.

25:37.366 --> 25:39.721
Well, I'm having trouble
remembering that.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.871
For one thing,
they're pretty cute.

25:42.107 --> 25:44.772
Well, but cute is not gonna help
me sleep through the night.

25:44.786 --> 25:49.031
They smell great -- that newborn smell.
I mean, you can't beat that, right?

25:49.045 --> 25:50.902
The smell is pretty good.

25:51.085 --> 25:54.992
How about, you know,
when you give them their first bath?

25:55.005 --> 25:57.231
I remember when I gave
Rory her first bath,

25:57.246 --> 25:59.243
she looked up at me like,
"what the hell is going on?"

25:59.275 --> 26:01.602
And I kept saying, "I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

26:01.618 --> 26:03.523
Davey loved his first one.

26:03.538 --> 26:06.533
Martha screamed bloody murder.
Oh, my god, all the screaming.

26:06.546 --> 26:09.142
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but how about the first time

26:09.156 --> 26:11.973
when they're crying and crying,
and you go in to pick them up,

26:11.987 --> 26:15.542
and then they stop crying
because they recognize you?

26:15.555 --> 26:17.171
- That's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

26:17.185 --> 26:18.530
I'm not gonna sleep, though.

26:18.545 --> 26:22.161
Well, you won't sleep,
but you'll get another first smile.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.320
You know,
Davey had his at three weeks.

26:24.335 --> 26:26.071
It's really advanced.

26:26.148 --> 26:29.093
How about when you're lying down,
you're holding the baby,

26:29.108 --> 26:31.203
and the baby falls
asleep on your chest?

26:31.218 --> 26:33.231
They're all warm and cuddly.

26:33.245 --> 26:36.023
Oh, god, I know what you're doing.
You're trying to make this sound good.

26:36.057 --> 26:38.580
In the middle of the night,
when you're rocking the baby,

26:38.595 --> 26:43.162
and everyone is asleep. And then they
fall asleep, and you fall asleep.

26:43.176 --> 26:46.080
I'm hormonal,
and you are playing dirty.

26:46.148 --> 26:48.100
It's pretty good stuff, huh?

26:48.117 --> 26:49.572
I guess.

26:49.588 --> 26:51.303
Really good.

26:51.315 --> 26:53.682
Are you talking memory,
or are you thinking ahead?

26:53.698 --> 26:56.202
Oh, uh, I don't know --
a little of both, I guess.

26:56.216 --> 26:57.212
Really?

26:57.227 --> 26:59.810
Well, the subject has come up.
It might come up again.

27:00.325 --> 27:02.092
Oh, my god,
I'm gonna have another baby.

27:02.106 --> 27:05.680
Yes, and I will be there to help you.
No muffin tops required.

27:05.696 --> 27:07.311
Thank you. I know.

27:07.328 --> 27:10.000
Oh, god, I hope I have a girl.
Ooh! Or a boy.

27:10.016 --> 27:13.193
Well, chances are pretty good
you'll have one or the other.

27:14.176 --> 27:16.740
So, we seem to have a block of
eight days here in late march

27:16.757 --> 27:18.912
that is disturbingly free
of résumé-building activity.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.371
Might be a good time to commit
to some volunteer work.

27:21.385 --> 27:24.630
I'm not crazy about wheeling
around elderlies in bathrobes,

27:24.646 --> 27:26.403
so I'm leaning
towards tree planting.

27:26.415 --> 27:27.261
Sounds good.

27:27.278 --> 27:29.721
I'll check out some
community-service sites online.

27:29.738 --> 27:32.962
I found out the cutoff for the Lawrence
Way journalism fellowship application

27:32.975 --> 27:35.053
is march 1st,
so we have to get on that.

27:35.067 --> 27:38.012
And... Oh, have you written your
sample for the Iowa poetry prize?

27:38.026 --> 27:39.981
Yeah, I think that one's
a little farfetched.

27:39.996 --> 27:42.590
I mean, I only took one poetry class --
sophomore year.

27:42.606 --> 27:45.161
Hannah Freeman is applying for a
Fulbright to study space travel

27:45.175 --> 27:46.212
in Luneberg, Germany.

27:46.227 --> 27:47.702
Do you think she's ever
traveled to space?

27:47.736 --> 27:49.591
Besides, the writing
sample is a poem --

27:49.607 --> 27:51.723
takes 20 minutes to write,
2 if it's haiku.

27:51.736 --> 27:52.603
I know, but --

27:52.618 --> 27:54.091
You could've told me you were
going to be so resistant

27:54.127 --> 27:55.972
to operation finish line
when we agreed to it.

27:55.987 --> 27:57.493
I'm sorry.
When did we agree to it?

27:57.507 --> 28:00.141
And this is not about making charts.
It's about our careers.

28:00.157 --> 28:02.382
It's about life.
I'm trying to help you here.

28:02.396 --> 28:05.600
Did you talk to your grandfather about
hooking me up with Dean Kerrigan?

28:06.865 --> 28:09.033
Hmm? Hum, yeah, I did.
I did that.

28:09.046 --> 28:09.940
And?

28:09.955 --> 28:11.640
Um, he said he'd look into it.

28:11.658 --> 28:13.582
"Look into it"?
That's not going to cut it.

28:13.597 --> 28:15.291
You have got to put
the screws to the guy.

28:15.307 --> 28:17.420
I don't care if he's your grandfather.
He's part of our game plan,

28:17.455 --> 28:20.061
and he's got to play ball.
Why do you keep...

28:20.077 --> 28:21.810
- Is that Lucy?
- Yeah.

28:21.828 --> 28:23.722
- Have you heard from her yet?
- No.

28:23.735 --> 28:25.873
Oh, so now she's decided
to just ignore you?

28:25.887 --> 28:27.052
How very "Heathers" of her.

28:27.067 --> 28:28.583
I don't think she saw me.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.870
Paris, no.

28:33.176 --> 28:35.772
Okay, look,
it's time to put an end

28:35.785 --> 28:37.800
to this little junior-high
game you're playing.

28:38.426 --> 28:39.722
Hey, Paris.

28:39.735 --> 28:41.481
Have you read Rory's
letter or not?

28:41.496 --> 28:43.191
Um, yeah, I just --

28:43.205 --> 28:45.413
Would you please tell her you
forgive her and kiss and make up,

28:45.447 --> 28:46.962
because it's really
messing with her head?

28:46.997 --> 28:48.593
Um, sorry, Lucy, I didn't --

28:48.608 --> 28:50.753
Don't apologize.
I've got her on the ropes.

28:50.768 --> 28:53.620
I just got back an hour ago,
so just read your letter.

28:53.638 --> 28:54.681
Yeah? And?

28:54.697 --> 28:57.362
Well, it's not really fair,
I mean, you being a writer.

28:57.375 --> 28:59.293
Yeah, yeah, life's not fair.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.140
Can you let her off the hook,
for god's sakes?

29:01.155 --> 29:03.010
In case you didn't know it,
Rory is a great person,

29:03.045 --> 29:04.701
and she does not deserve
to be treated this way.

29:04.736 --> 29:06.922
Anyone should fell lucky
to call her a friend.

29:06.938 --> 29:09.301
I know I do, and you're
throwing away one of the best.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.882
Paris, please.
I appreciate where this is coming from,

29:11.896 --> 29:13.952
but can we just have a minute?

29:16.616 --> 29:18.741
It was a really
beautiful letter.

29:18.755 --> 29:19.680
Thanks.

29:19.698 --> 29:23.681
Look, I know that Marty put you
in a really crappy position.

29:23.695 --> 29:25.720
Yeah, but I -- Well, he did.

29:25.736 --> 29:26.782
Totally crappy.

29:26.796 --> 29:28.373
But I could've said,

29:28.388 --> 29:30.290
"no, Marty,
you're being stupid and immature."

29:30.305 --> 29:31.640
Which he was so being.

29:31.655 --> 29:33.741
But I just --
I handled it wrong. I mean,

29:33.758 --> 29:36.120
can I say again how
much I screwed up?

29:36.138 --> 29:37.623
No, you didn't screw up.

29:37.638 --> 29:40.520
Marty asked you to do something
really weird and wrong,

29:40.535 --> 29:43.521
and you did it 'cause
you're a great person.

29:43.538 --> 29:44.662
Ask Paris.

29:44.678 --> 29:46.100
Well, I don't know about --

29:46.118 --> 29:48.933
I even tried to figure out what
I would've done in your shoes,

29:48.945 --> 29:53.162
and, I mean, I even tried to act it out
with Olivia playing the role of Marty.

29:53.175 --> 29:54.521
- Seriously?
- I know, right?

29:54.535 --> 29:56.113
Any chance to act.

29:56.125 --> 29:59.553
But it didn't really work
because as much as I love Olivia,

29:59.567 --> 30:01.903
her Marty was so over-the-top.

30:01.918 --> 30:04.343
Are things okay
with you and Marty?

30:04.477 --> 30:06.450
Not so much. We broke up.

30:06.468 --> 30:08.140
Oh, no.

30:09.098 --> 30:11.050
Oh, well, right?

30:11.068 --> 30:12.952
I'm so, so sorry.

30:12.966 --> 30:15.382
No, I mean,
it wasn't your fault.

30:15.395 --> 30:17.201
It wasn't meant to be.

30:18.286 --> 30:20.610
Listen, I got to go
to my first class.

30:20.625 --> 30:23.230
- Oh, yeah, okay.
- But I'll call you, okay?

30:23.247 --> 30:25.422
Okay. Yeah. See you.

30:29.205 --> 30:30.742
- Everything okay now?
- Yep.

30:30.757 --> 30:33.713
Good. Did you ask her about
actresses she knows at Yale Dramat?

30:34.057 --> 30:36.651
Why have I even bothered
to do all this?

30:47.645 --> 30:49.621
Yeah. There we go.

30:49.846 --> 30:50.811
What?

30:51.388 --> 30:52.690
That's straight.

30:53.065 --> 30:54.120
It's straight.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.720
Fine, you want to prove it?
I'll find a level and prove it.

31:00.915 --> 31:03.331
Where's the level, Paul Anka?

31:04.877 --> 31:05.962
The level!

31:06.237 --> 31:07.740
Find the level, boy!

31:08.155 --> 31:10.313
All right.
You've been absolutely no help.

31:13.558 --> 31:16.703
All right, now, miss Nardini,
what kind of provisions

31:16.715 --> 31:18.511
have you made for your
daughter in New Mexico --

31:18.545 --> 31:20.032
house, schools?

31:20.045 --> 31:23.332
I've already rented a
house in a nice area,

31:23.446 --> 31:25.600
checked out the
immediate neighborhood,

31:25.618 --> 31:28.103
and there's a lot of kids
there that are April's age.

31:28.118 --> 31:32.473
I have enrolled her in a local school
that is very highly recommended,

31:32.487 --> 31:34.730
um, put her up for swim team.

31:34.747 --> 31:36.772
Your honor,
we don't contest that miss Nardini

31:36.788 --> 31:39.331
will make April's transition
to the new living situation

31:39.346 --> 31:41.140
as seamless as possible.

31:41.155 --> 31:45.173
We contest the part where she cuts
the child off from her father.

31:45.185 --> 31:48.451
A father she barely knows,
who does not have -- let's face it --

31:48.468 --> 31:50.601
the most sterling
personal history.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.620
Okay. Look.
I know what you're talking about,

31:52.638 --> 31:54.840
and, yeah,
I've made a few mistakes.

31:54.858 --> 31:56.210
- Luke, hang on.
- It's true.

31:56.226 --> 31:58.680
I was married before,
and it only lasted a few months,

31:58.695 --> 32:00.793
but it ended amicably...
pretty much.

32:00.808 --> 32:02.340
Mr. Danes, I need you to --

32:02.358 --> 32:03.920
I may live above a diner,

32:03.935 --> 32:06.001
and some people may
see me as a hermit.

32:06.016 --> 32:07.370
And I'm the first
person to admit

32:07.385 --> 32:10.691
that all of my relationships
haven't exactly been long-term.

32:10.706 --> 32:12.341
Mr. McNally.

32:12.377 --> 32:14.310
Yeah, you know,
but this is different.

32:14.328 --> 32:16.301
We are talking
about my daughter,

32:16.316 --> 32:19.160
who I didn't even know I had for
the first 12 years of her life.

32:19.177 --> 32:21.090
And now that I know her,
and I know I'm her dad,

32:21.105 --> 32:23.673
I just want to be with
her and be her dad

32:23.686 --> 32:26.143
'cause I know I
will be a good dad.

32:26.155 --> 32:28.642
Mr. Danes, be quiet.

32:28.658 --> 32:32.463
I'm sorry, your honor.
This won't happen again.

33:05.275 --> 33:06.673
All right.

33:06.708 --> 33:10.111
Now that I've had the opportunity to
hear from both sides in this case,

33:10.128 --> 33:14.090
I'm going to read some personal
references into the court record.

33:14.705 --> 33:18.570
The first letter is written
on behalf of Mr. Danes

33:18.586 --> 33:20.551
by a miss Lorelai Gilmore.

33:20.566 --> 33:24.162
This is dated january 9, 2007.

33:24.358 --> 33:26.331
"To whom it may concern,

33:26.345 --> 33:29.090
"in the nearly 10 years that
I have known Luke Danes,

33:29.108 --> 33:32.290
"I have come to know him as
an honest and decent man.

33:32.308 --> 33:36.201
"He's also one of the most kind
and caring persons I have ever met.

33:36.216 --> 33:39.242
"I'm a single mother,
and I raised my daughter by myself,

33:39.255 --> 33:41.742
"but once Luke Danes became
my friend in this town,

33:41.757 --> 33:43.750
"I never really felt alone.

33:43.765 --> 33:46.303
"Luke and I have had our ups
and downs over the years,

33:46.318 --> 33:49.172
"but through it all, his relationship
with my daughter, Rory,

33:49.188 --> 33:50.803
"has never changed.

33:50.817 --> 33:53.552
"He's always been there
for her no matter what.

33:53.567 --> 33:55.432
"He was there to
celebrate her birthdays.

33:55.448 --> 33:58.750
"He was there cheering her on
at her high school graduation.

33:58.767 --> 34:02.183
"Luke has been a sort of father
figure in my daughter's life.

34:02.197 --> 34:04.731
"With his own daughter,
Luke wasn't given the opportunity

34:04.748 --> 34:06.843
"to be there for
her first 12 years,

34:06.857 --> 34:09.663
"but he should be given
that opportunity now.

34:09.678 --> 34:12.051
"Once Luke Danes
is in your life,

34:12.068 --> 34:13.913
"he is in your life forever.

34:13.925 --> 34:17.760
"I know from personal experience
what an amazing gift that is,

34:17.777 --> 34:20.380
"and not to allow him
access to his daughter

34:20.396 --> 34:24.493
"would be to seriously deprive
her of all this man has to offer,

34:24.507 --> 34:26.542
"and he offers so much.

34:26.556 --> 34:28.271
"Thank you for your time.

34:28.288 --> 34:31.320
"Sincerely, Lorelai Gilmore."

35:01.026 --> 35:02.382
Hiya!

35:03.287 --> 35:05.353
I want to see the TV.

35:05.436 --> 35:08.802
Holy cripes, that's big.

35:08.815 --> 35:12.413
Oh, my gosh.
Does that come with a slushee machine

35:12.427 --> 35:14.700
and a gangly teenage Usher?

35:14.837 --> 35:17.382
Honey, the deal with Sookie...

35:20.795 --> 35:22.030
Chris?

35:22.046 --> 35:23.711
I read your letter.

35:23.946 --> 35:26.780
Honey, it's not a letter.
It's just a character reference

35:26.797 --> 35:29.333
that Luke asked me to
write for his court case.

35:29.348 --> 35:31.092
Reads like a letter.

35:31.105 --> 35:32.091
Oh, yeah?

35:32.106 --> 35:34.072
Almost like a love letter.

35:34.528 --> 35:38.093
No, it's a favor that Luke
asked 'cause he needed --

35:38.108 --> 35:40.740
You know what? Before you go
through a whole list of excuses,

35:40.756 --> 35:42.481
let me just ask --

35:42.496 --> 35:46.730
is our marriage for you
basically just marking time?

35:46.847 --> 35:48.833
- What.
- Come on, Lore.

35:48.845 --> 35:50.131
Of course not.

35:50.148 --> 35:53.652
Obviously you still have very
deep feelings for the guy.

35:53.668 --> 35:56.512
No, no, I just have known
him a long time, and he's...

35:56.525 --> 35:59.902
Always been there,
always will be there.

36:00.436 --> 36:03.372
Luke needed a character
reference for court

36:03.385 --> 36:05.980
to prove that he deserves
partial custody of April,

36:05.996 --> 36:07.520
and I know him really well.

36:07.535 --> 36:08.711
Yes, you do.

36:08.727 --> 36:10.532
And so it just made sens
that he would ask me

36:10.545 --> 36:12.211
to write that
character reference.

36:12.227 --> 36:14.670
I can't believe I just
had coffee from his place.

36:14.686 --> 36:17.660
Coffee? Sweetie,
I told you Sookie brought that, okay?

36:17.676 --> 36:20.713
Do you still talk to him?
I mean, do you see him?

36:20.728 --> 36:21.953
This is crazy.

36:21.965 --> 36:23.660
Hey, I got a right.

36:23.935 --> 36:25.810
I have a right to know.

36:25.847 --> 36:29.321
Occasionally I see him because
we live in the same town.

36:29.335 --> 36:31.070
- Yeah, and I know you, Lore.
- And?

36:31.085 --> 36:33.023
And I know that you're
not done with him.

36:33.036 --> 36:35.331
Okay, this is ridiculous.
This is -- Hey.

36:35.348 --> 36:37.151
This is a ridiculous
conversation, okay?

36:37.168 --> 36:40.441
I have a history with him, yes.
I was engaged to him, yes.

36:40.458 --> 36:42.180
But I married you.

36:42.198 --> 36:44.151
Tell me you're not
in love with him.

36:44.168 --> 36:45.923
I'm not in love with him.

36:48.198 --> 36:50.540
I should've known.
I mean, all the signs were there.

36:50.557 --> 36:51.640
What signs?

36:51.655 --> 36:54.091
The fact that you didn't
want to leave Stars Hollow,

36:54.107 --> 36:55.811
that you were dead set
against redoing the wedding,

36:55.845 --> 36:57.861
that you didn't want to
have a baby with me.

36:57.875 --> 36:59.383
I mean,
it's all because of him, right?

36:59.418 --> 37:02.191
No. How can I tell --
It's over, okay?

37:02.205 --> 37:04.681
What I had with him,
it's over, Chris.

37:04.696 --> 37:06.682
Then why did you hide
the letter from me?

37:06.696 --> 37:10.011
I wasn't hiding it. I put it in the
drawer in case they lost the typed copy

37:10.026 --> 37:11.932
or the judge spilled coffee on it,
the dog ate it.

37:11.965 --> 37:13.372
I don't know why I didn't
tell you about it.

37:13.405 --> 37:15.512
I think that it's because
you're still in love with him.

37:15.546 --> 37:17.181
No, I love you. I love you.

37:17.196 --> 37:19.060
You know what?
I-I'm sorry, Lore.

37:19.075 --> 37:20.991
I just -- I can't handle this.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.523
- Handle what?
- This. You and him.

37:23.535 --> 37:27.122
I just -- I can't handle
being your second choice.

37:27.138 --> 37:30.123
I thought I could,
but I can't, all right?

37:30.237 --> 37:32.111
I can't be your rebound.

37:32.127 --> 37:33.653
I'm sorry.

37:38.335 --> 37:39.762
Christopher?

37:41.265 --> 37:42.671
Chris?

37:48.287 --> 37:51.672
Okay, I will check out the
poposaurus project at the peabody,

37:51.687 --> 37:54.322
but there is no way I'm
signing up for the lsats.

37:54.337 --> 37:56.161
Sure you are.
Don't get lazy on me now.

37:56.175 --> 37:57.490
The finish line is in sight.

37:57.507 --> 37:58.863
I'm not being lazy, Paris.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.630
I'm not interested in being a lawyer.
I'm interested in journalism.

38:01.646 --> 38:03.860
Just because you go to law school doesn't
mean you have you have to be a lawyer.

38:03.898 --> 38:06.233
Look at Dan Abrams -- he's a journalist
-- but because of his law degree,

38:06.268 --> 38:08.080
he became the face of
the Scott Peterson trial.

38:08.115 --> 38:09.962
I don't want to be the face
of the Scott Peterson trial,

38:09.998 --> 38:13.480
and I hate Dan Abrams.
I will also not be taking the mcats.

38:13.498 --> 38:16.191
Sanjay Gupta,
senior medical correspondent at CNN.

38:16.207 --> 38:17.532
Right now,
he's got the market cornered.

38:17.565 --> 38:19.091
Well, good for Sanjay.

38:20.838 --> 38:21.911
Hello?

38:21.927 --> 38:23.520
Oh, hey, Lucy.

38:23.787 --> 38:24.960
Now?

38:24.977 --> 38:28.120
Um, yeah, yeah.
No, that sounds great.

38:28.137 --> 38:29.872
I'll see you there. Okay. Bye.

38:29.935 --> 38:32.380
Grab your coats.
We're going tray sledding.

38:32.396 --> 38:32.983
What?

38:32.996 --> 38:34.931
We're gonna meet Lucy
over at the dining hall,

38:34.948 --> 38:37.742
sneak out a couple of trays, and
then go tray sledding down Science Hill.

38:37.755 --> 38:38.981
We can cross it off the list.
Come on.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.412
But tray sledding isn't slated
to happen for a few more weeks.

38:41.448 --> 38:44.301
Well, that's okay, 'cause there might
not be as much snow in a couple weeks.

38:44.337 --> 38:47.232
And Lucy and Olivia happen to
be going today, so let's go.

38:47.247 --> 38:48.442
Are you sure you want
me to come with you?

38:48.475 --> 38:50.673
- Paris.
- Okay, okay.

38:51.987 --> 38:53.683
Hey, uh, listen.

38:53.695 --> 38:56.440
Thanks for saying those things you
said about me in the cafeteria.

38:56.455 --> 39:00.121
Oh, well, I just didn't want your juvenile
hysterics to muck up the whole chart.

39:00.136 --> 39:00.902
I know.

39:00.918 --> 39:02.272
You two were behaving
like children.

39:02.306 --> 39:04.211
I thought I was gonna have to
put you on the naughty step.

39:04.248 --> 39:07.002
Still, it's just nice
to hear sometimes.

39:07.018 --> 39:08.233
You're not going to cry,
are you?

39:08.267 --> 39:09.832
- No, I don't think so.
- Good.

39:09.847 --> 39:10.770
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

39:10.808 --> 39:12.373
Let's go. Oh, wait.

39:12.386 --> 39:14.470
If you fall and break your face,
as many tray sledders do,

39:14.507 --> 39:16.602
don't worry about it 'cause you can
spend the night in the infirmary,

39:16.636 --> 39:19.172
which is another typical
college experience.

39:19.487 --> 39:20.770
Wait. What?

39:20.786 --> 39:21.943
Come on.

39:52.036 --> 39:52.993
Hello?

39:53.007 --> 39:54.951
Hey, I didn't wake you, did I?

39:54.967 --> 39:58.421
Uh, no, hi. No, I'm up.

39:58.438 --> 40:00.903
I just had to tell you. I won.

40:01.237 --> 40:02.591
You won?

40:02.608 --> 40:04.550
It's incredible.
I thought I was screwed.

40:04.567 --> 40:09.312
I mean, her lawyer dug up every last
bit of dirt she could find on me, but...

40:09.326 --> 40:12.050
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Luke, that's great.

40:12.066 --> 40:15.263
Yeah, the judge waited until this
morning to give us her decision.

40:15.276 --> 40:17.740
Oh, man, was that the longest
night of my life. But...

40:17.757 --> 40:21.021
I just got off with my lawyer.
I get shared custody.

40:21.036 --> 40:23.291
Wow. Congratulations.

40:23.306 --> 40:25.671
Yeah, I get to see April at
least one weekend a month,

40:25.686 --> 40:27.961
every other major holiday,
half the summer.

40:27.977 --> 40:30.332
We're gonna work it all out.
It's so great.

40:30.346 --> 40:31.912
So great.

40:31.926 --> 40:34.362
Yeah, I guess the judge just took
everything into consideration

40:34.398 --> 40:36.821
and realized how much I
wanted to be in April's life.

40:36.836 --> 40:40.580
And, of course,
your letter was a big help.

40:40.696 --> 40:45.441
Well, I just wanted to help you,
help April.

40:45.455 --> 40:48.340
Well, you did,
and I'm really grateful.

40:48.356 --> 40:51.730
Anyway, uh,
sorry to call so early.

40:51.747 --> 40:53.262
Thanks again.

40:53.276 --> 40:55.092
Congratulations.

41:02.516 --> 41:06.812
Now, when it comes to papers,
I'm guessing that some of you,

41:06.826 --> 41:09.760
of course,
will be asking me for an extension.

41:09.775 --> 41:11.330
You will be happy to learn

41:11.345 --> 41:13.832
that I have no problem
with extensions.

41:13.848 --> 41:15.481
Here's what you do.

41:15.498 --> 41:17.222
You look at the due
date of the paper,

41:17.235 --> 41:21.033
and then you mark it on your calendar
two weeks prior to that date.

41:21.047 --> 41:22.411
And there you have it.

41:22.427 --> 41:24.541
I've just granted you
a two-week extension.

41:24.556 --> 41:27.551
By the way, my office hours
are every tuesday morning,

41:27.567 --> 41:31.040
and you're welcome to come to me
with any questions or problems,

41:31.056 --> 41:34.871
economic or non, my expertise
extends beyond Keynesian theory,

41:34.888 --> 41:37.742
and I will be happy
to lend an ear.

41:37.895 --> 41:40.142
So, let's get started.

41:41.317 --> 41:43.691
As you know, this course...

41:43.708 --> 41:45.940
will take a specific look at...

41:45.958 --> 41:48.790
processes and determinants...

41:48.805 --> 41:51.343
of overall economic p...

42:00.168 --> 42:02.110
Someone call 911!
