02:26.605 --> 02:28.549
SeÃ±or...

02:28.649 --> 02:30.674
we must not go any further.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.469
Look!

02:35.739 --> 02:39.435
It is an ancient,
sacred Hovitos symbol.

02:39.535 --> 02:42.312
It's certain death for
anyone who enters.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.064
We must turn back...

02:44.164 --> 02:45.773
now!

06:34.770 --> 06:36.129
George.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.547
Hello?

06:37.647 --> 06:39.216
Earth to George.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.801
George!

06:40.901 --> 06:42.469
Are you daydreaming again?

06:42.569 --> 06:47.599
No, no, I was just admiring how
clean and shiny this grill is.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.476
Come on, George. We're busy here.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.894
You know what the problem is?

06:50.994 --> 06:54.106
Nobody here appreciates a
guy with a good imagination.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.149
Well, at least not the
people at the lumber yard

06:56.249 --> 06:59.069
or the miniature golf course
or Floyd's Fish Market,

06:59.169 --> 07:02.072
or any of the other places you
worked in the last month, right?

07:02.172 --> 07:05.367
Yeah. Well, someday...
someday they'll be sorry.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.703
They'll be eating
breakfast or something

07:07.803 --> 07:12.082
and all of a sudden, they'll say, "Hey!
We screwed up!

07:12.182 --> 07:14.584
We never should have
fired George Newman

07:14.684 --> 07:16.919
because he's got imagination."

07:18.647 --> 07:20.757
Well, I think the fries
are just about done.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.802
Aw, jeez, you better not
let Big Edna see that.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.971
- She'll have a fit.
- Big Edna, Big Edna.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.764
You sound like a broken record.

07:27.864 --> 07:31.975
Why are you so afraid of
that pathetic tub of lard?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.985
Whoa!

07:59.479 --> 08:01.089
How could you do this to me?

08:01.189 --> 08:03.133
I knew this was gonna happen.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.802
You're right, Bob. I'm sorry.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.220
What can I say?

08:07.320 --> 08:10.057
I'm a miserable,
worthless hunk of slime.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.059
Here.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.353
I want you to take
this crowbar and...

08:14.453 --> 08:16.188
just bash my head right in!

08:16.288 --> 08:19.107
Go ahead, really. Please.
Just bash it right in!

08:19.207 --> 08:21.151
George, you know I couldn't do that.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.903
You still owe me five bucks.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.034
Hey, Kuni.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.702
Hiya, George.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.162
Beginner's class today, huh?

08:32.261 --> 08:35.582
Yeah. They're so stupid!

08:35.682 --> 08:37.624
Oh!

08:39.769 --> 08:41.669
Stupid!

08:52.449 --> 08:55.102
Boy!

08:55.202 --> 08:57.437
Look what I got here, Bob.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.357
A twinkie-wiener sandwich!

09:00.457 --> 09:01.983
Your favorite.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.449
Come on, Bob. Cheer up, will you?

09:09.549 --> 09:11.617
You ruined my life.

09:16.932 --> 09:18.583
You know, Bob-o,

09:18.683 --> 09:21.294
I think you're developing
a bad attitude here.

09:24.272 --> 09:28.301
You see, Bob... you gotta
look at the big picture.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.846
You gotta grab life by the lips

09:30.946 --> 09:32.597
and yank as hard as you can!

09:36.326 --> 09:38.186
See anything in the want ads?

09:38.286 --> 09:42.065
Yeah. But nothing with the prestige
of working at Burger World.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.193
So what do you think Teri's gonna say
when she hears you got fired again?

09:45.293 --> 09:48.445
Teri? Oh, no. What time is it?

09:49.839 --> 09:53.326
7:30? Oh boy, I gotta go.
I'll see you later, Bob.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.078
Stupid!

09:56.930 --> 09:59.340
So, what's your excuse this time?

09:59.840 --> 10:02.252
Well, Bob and I were having

10:02.352 --> 10:05.881
a serious discussion about
our various career options.

10:05.981 --> 10:07.883
Boy, I really like what
you've done with your hair.

10:07.983 --> 10:11.760
- It's really...
- George, did you get fired again?

10:12.779 --> 10:15.307
Yes! Yes! It's all true!

10:15.407 --> 10:19.685
I just don't know
what's wrong with me!

10:20.370 --> 10:22.020
So, what's for dinner?

10:22.831 --> 10:25.192
Mashed potatoes? My favorite!

10:25.292 --> 10:27.277
Teri, you shouldn't have.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.779
George!

10:29.879 --> 10:33.783
When are you gonna start taking
things a little more seriously?

10:33.883 --> 10:36.244
I mean, you've been
wandering aimlessly

10:36.344 --> 10:39.498
from job to job ever
since I've known you.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.751
If you could just get that
overactive imagination of yours

10:42.851 --> 10:46.716
to work for you instead of
against you, maybe you could...

10:49.816 --> 10:51.635
What are you doing?

10:51.735 --> 10:55.470
This means something.
This is important.

11:02.287 --> 11:06.231
Oh, George, that is just terrible.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.985
But don't you worry,

11:09.085 --> 11:10.987
you're a fine young man.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.657
I'm sure you'll get
another job right away.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.284
You got such a good face.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.036
Look at this face.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.413
Would you look at this face?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.582
Is this a face you could die for?

11:25.310 --> 11:27.754
So, where's Uncle Harvey?
I haven't seen him all night.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.339
Oh, he'll be out soon.

11:29.439 --> 11:33.133
I think he's having some sort of
last-minute business meeting.

11:33.902 --> 11:37.013
Two pair, aces high.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.103
Yeah, what?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.604
Hey, Louie.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.941
I just wanted to congratulate you,
Mr. Bilchik.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.236
You did very well at the
track this afternoon.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.280
Oh, yeah? I won again, huh?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.697
Right. Yeah. Thanks, Louie. Bye.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.327
Now, what are we doing here?

11:59.427 --> 12:01.369
It's your deal, Harvey.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.708
Oh, hi, honey.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.126
Have you finished your meeting?

12:06.226 --> 12:07.794
Oh, yeah, yeah,

12:07.894 --> 12:10.046
and business was great tonight.

12:10.146 --> 12:13.049
Harvey, have you been gambling again?

12:13.149 --> 12:15.010
Hey! What are you complaining about?

12:15.110 --> 12:18.929
This is for when you go
shopping on Rodeo Drive.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.143
What's this?

12:23.243 --> 12:26.021
Oh, that's the deed to Channel 62.

12:26.121 --> 12:28.356
I won it with a pair of sevens.
I was bluffing.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.358
Channel 62?

12:30.458 --> 12:32.152
- Never heard of it.
- I'm not surprised.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.696
More people watch the fish
tank at Leo's pet store.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.449
It's a little UHF station
on the edge of town.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.659
It's been on the brink
of bankruptcy for years.

12:39.759 --> 12:43.079
- It's too bad I gotta dump it.
- Oh, really?

12:43.179 --> 12:47.375
I kind of like the idea of us
having our own TV station.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.461
Forget about it.

12:49.561 --> 12:53.298
They can't even find anybody
to manage the place anymore.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.843
Harvey, I know somebody
who'd be perfect for the job.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.802
Oh, yeah? Who's that?

13:00.905 --> 13:04.683
George! George, dear, can you
come over here for a second?

13:06.578 --> 13:08.146
Oh, no.

13:08.246 --> 13:11.148
No, not him. Forget it. No way.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.988
I can't believe your Uncle Harvey's

13:17.088 --> 13:19.449
letting you run his TV station.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.409
Hey, he trusts me.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.952
Besides, he's going to California.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.911
He doesn't want to
be bothered with it.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.420
Well, here we are.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.137
This is it?

13:41.237 --> 13:44.015
Wow, this is even
better than I imagined!

13:44.115 --> 13:46.893
Come on. Let's go check it out.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.311
I don't know, George.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.645
I'm not so sure about this.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.192
See? The front door's open.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.027
It's a friendly place.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.736
Hey, mister!

13:58.379 --> 14:01.324
Change? You got change?

14:01.424 --> 14:03.909
Oh... sure.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.956
85...

14:08.056 --> 14:09.582
95...

14:09.682 --> 14:12.210
one dollar!

14:12.310 --> 14:14.628
Thanks, mister.

14:24.572 --> 14:27.933
Hello. I'm Mr. Ed.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.274
<i>A horse is a horse,
of course, of course</i>

14:34.374 --> 14:36.276
<i>And no one can talk
to a horse, of course</i>

14:36.376 --> 14:38.403
<i>That is, of course, unless the horse</i>

14:38.503 --> 14:40.864
<i>Is the famous Mr. Ed</i>

14:40.964 --> 14:42.782
<i>Go right to the source
and ask the horse</i>

14:42.882 --> 14:44.909
<i>He'll give you the answer
that you'll endorse</i>

14:45.009 --> 14:47.287
<i>He's always on a steady course</i>

14:47.387 --> 14:49.539
<i>Talk to Mr. Ed</i>

14:51.432 --> 14:53.126
Can I help you?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.086
Who are you?

14:55.186 --> 14:57.088
I'm Philo.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.922
Chief engineer.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.635
So...

15:02.735 --> 15:05.346
isn't it a little late
for you to be working?

15:05.446 --> 15:07.557
I mean, what time do
you normally go home?

15:07.657 --> 15:11.518
This is my home. I live here.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.772
Hold these.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.485
No, no, like this.

15:22.297 --> 15:23.948
What are you doing?

15:24.048 --> 15:27.577
Oh, I just want to
see if my interociter

15:27.677 --> 15:31.581
can withstand a sudden
charge of 60,000 volts.

15:31.681 --> 15:35.041
What?

15:42.150 --> 15:44.803
Yeah...

15:44.903 --> 15:46.928
it works.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.557
<i>Do do do do</i>

15:49.657 --> 15:51.309
<i>Wee-oo, wee-oo</i>

15:51.409 --> 15:53.478
<i>Do do do do</i>

15:53.578 --> 15:56.105
<i>Do wah do wah...</i>

15:56.205 --> 15:58.900
I don't know about this, George.
I mean, I don't know the first thing

15:59.000 --> 16:00.777
about what goes on at
a television station.

16:00.877 --> 16:03.863
Don't worry, Bob. It's just
like working in a fish market,

16:03.963 --> 16:06.781
except you don't have to
clean and gut fish all day.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.172
Yeah, so? Can I help you?

16:21.272 --> 16:22.924
Hi. I'm George Newman.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.634
I'm the new station manager.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.513
You know, when I first took this job,

16:28.613 --> 16:31.933
they told me that this
position was only temporary

16:32.033 --> 16:34.227
and that eventually,
when the time was right,

16:34.327 --> 16:38.147
I would be moved up to news,
which is really my forte.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.858
You know how long I've
been working here?

16:39.958 --> 16:41.442
Two years!

16:41.542 --> 16:43.152
It's kind of hard to get promoted

16:43.252 --> 16:45.697
when every other week
you have a new boss!

16:45.797 --> 16:49.199
This job really sucks.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.120
And this is my friend Bob.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.538
Hi. Nice to meet you.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.498
Howdy, friends. It's Crazy Ernie

16:55.598 --> 16:57.584
from Crazy Ernie's Used Car Emporium.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.128
It's a giant supermarket of cars!

17:00.228 --> 17:02.755
I got so many cars people
come up to me and say,

17:02.855 --> 17:05.842
"Hey, Crazy Ernie,
where'd you get all those cars?"

17:05.942 --> 17:09.012
Lookie here! I got red cars,
I got green cars!

17:09.112 --> 17:11.431
I got enough cars to choke a camel!

17:11.531 --> 17:12.848
Tell you what, friends,

17:12.949 --> 17:15.101
if nobody comes down and buys
a car from me in the next hour,

17:15.201 --> 17:17.729
I'm gonna club this baby seal!

17:17.829 --> 17:21.273
That's right! I'm gonna club
a seal to make a better deal!

17:21.374 --> 17:23.067
You know I'll do it, too,

17:23.166 --> 17:26.029
'cause I'm crazy! Ha ha ha!

17:26.128 --> 17:29.198
Look at all the old reruns
this station is airing.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.701
We could sure use
some more live shows.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.453
I don't know, something like...

17:33.553 --> 17:34.996
Oh, no!

17:35.096 --> 17:36.581
You okay in there, Pam?

17:36.681 --> 17:38.958
Yes. It's just if it's not
one thing, it's another.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.210
You know, that mailman's
really got a screw loose.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.464
He delivers us this package.
It's supposed to go to R.J. Fletcher.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.882
Who?

17:45.982 --> 17:48.384
R.J. Fletcher. He runs Channel 8,

17:48.484 --> 17:51.054
you know, the network
affiliate downtown?

17:51.154 --> 17:54.307
Oh, well, I guess I'll just have to
send it back to him tomorrow.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.352
No. That's okay.
I-I'll take it over myself.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.936
It'll be a good chance
to meet the competition.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.482
You know, George, I'll tell you,

18:02.582 --> 18:04.317
I don't really think
that's such a good idea.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.861
I heard he's not the
nicest guy in the world.

18:06.961 --> 18:10.073
Oh, come on.
He can't be all that bad.

18:10.173 --> 18:13.159
You just gotta know how
to talk to those guys.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.955
You idiot! Can't you do
anything I tell you to do?

18:17.055 --> 18:19.165
Does this look like a No. 2 pencil?

18:19.265 --> 18:21.084
- No. I just thought...
- You thought?

18:21.184 --> 18:22.794
I don't pay you to think!

18:22.894 --> 18:24.837
- But, Dad...
- Shut up!

18:24.937 --> 18:26.547
Let's get back to the meeting.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.341
All right, who's got
the research report?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.718
I left the report on your desk, sir.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.680
I don't see it.
When did you put it here?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.098
Yesterday before I left, sir.

18:35.198 --> 18:39.435
The janitor. It must
have been the janitor.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.729
He probably threw it out when
he was cleaning up in here.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.731
Send in the janitor.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.775
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.861
I will not tolerate this kind
of behavior at Channel 8.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.447
This is a business, not a home

18:51.547 --> 18:53.908
for irresponsible pus-brains!

18:56.135 --> 19:00.289
You wanted to see me, sir?

19:00.389 --> 19:01.958
That's right.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.002
I guess you know why
I called you in here.

19:04.102 --> 19:07.672
Because you're lonely?

19:07.772 --> 19:09.799
No, you moron.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.676
Oh, duh.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.344
Now, look carefully.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.471
Do you see anything
missing from this desk?

19:17.740 --> 19:19.198
That stapler?

19:20.118 --> 19:21.604
No!

19:23.704 --> 19:27.817
Now listen to me. There was a
very important file on this desk,

19:27.917 --> 19:32.196
a file that represented two
months of intensive research.

19:32.296 --> 19:35.158
It's my guess that you threw it out.

19:35.258 --> 19:38.077
Oh, no, sir. No...

19:38.177 --> 19:39.954
Were you in here
cleaning up last night?

19:40.054 --> 19:41.914
Yes, sir... yes, sir, I was.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.624
Do you see that file on my desk now?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.795
Gee, I don't know.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.881
I think I've proven my point.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.675
You are a worthless
human being Mr....

19:52.775 --> 19:56.054
Spadowski. Stanley Spadowski.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.181
May I call you Stanley?

19:58.281 --> 19:59.974
Okay.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.185
Stanley, you're fired!

20:02.285 --> 20:03.895
But I... I didn't...

20:03.995 --> 20:05.480
Get out!

20:05.580 --> 20:07.355
But I...

20:10.293 --> 20:11.985
People are...

20:12.628 --> 20:14.906
I can't believe the
incompetence in this place.

20:15.006 --> 20:17.575
People like that should
be put to sleep.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.542
Well, what do you know?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.252
The research file.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.422
Here it is. Been sitting
here all the time.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.940
Betty, hold my calls.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.775
Yes, Mr. Fletcher.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.652
Hey, R.J.!

20:58.633 --> 21:01.119
Hi! George Newman, U-62.

21:01.219 --> 21:04.247
Say, nice place you got here.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.208
You know, I was just thinking,
since we're both in the business...

21:07.308 --> 21:08.668
Where'd you get this?

21:08.768 --> 21:10.837
Do you realize that stealing
mail is a federal offense?

21:10.937 --> 21:12.630
Hold on. You don't understand...

21:12.730 --> 21:15.216
No, you don't understand
how serious a crime this is.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.802
I think you'd just better clear
out your desk and get out.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.804
You're through, mister.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.681
But, I don't work here.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.392
Trespassing, huh?

21:24.492 --> 21:27.520
You've got 10 seconds to get
out before I call the police.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.064
Look, I thought we could...

21:30.164 --> 21:32.316
Five... four...

21:32.416 --> 21:33.901
- three...
- Gee, look at the time.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.654
Well, gotta go.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.655
Keep in touch.

21:47.890 --> 21:51.085
No. No. Please.
It's all I've got left!

21:51.185 --> 21:52.920
Let go. This is station property.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.962
No! No! It's my mop!

21:56.148 --> 21:57.466
Let go!

21:57.566 --> 21:59.592
Let go, you idiot!

22:00.903 --> 22:02.513
That's my mop!

22:02.613 --> 22:04.222
Not any more, buddy!

22:06.742 --> 22:08.060
Hey, are you all right?

22:08.160 --> 22:09.896
It's just not fair.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.356
Come on, forget about it.
It's only a mop.

22:12.456 --> 22:15.651
"Only a mop"? "Only a mop"?

22:15.751 --> 22:17.570
Oh, you don't understand.

22:17.670 --> 22:21.989
That mop was given to me for my
birthday when I was 8 years old.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.909
We've never been apart!

22:26.887 --> 22:28.538
Now...

22:29.265 --> 22:31.708
now I don't even have a job anymore.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.587
After 15 years, they just toss me out

22:34.687 --> 22:38.214
like an old bag of moldy tangerines.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.385
What am I gonna do?

22:43.029 --> 22:45.681
What am I gonna do?

22:48.559 --> 22:51.978
Well... maybe you could
come work for me.

22:52.747 --> 22:54.357
Really? You mean it?

22:54.457 --> 22:58.027
Sure. I guess we could use a janitor.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.488
- Stanley Spadowski.
- George Newman.

23:00.588 --> 23:01.989
I'm mighty glad to meet you, George.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.033
I'm gonna do a really good job.
You won't be sorry.

23:04.133 --> 23:06.869
I'm really gonna do a good job
for you, George. I'm a good janitor.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.496
You want me to clean
your glasses for you?

23:08.596 --> 23:11.415
- No, that's...
- I'll make them real shiny, real shiny.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.916
'cause we're friends, George?
We're friends.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.671
Nope.

23:16.771 --> 23:18.130
Is this it?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.131
Nope.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.261
Is this it?

23:23.361 --> 23:25.303
Nope.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.724
- Is this it?
- No, George.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.768
I can't delay the broadcast

23:30.868 --> 23:34.021
because the mayor is supposed
to be coming out any minute.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.523
Where is he?

23:35.623 --> 23:37.191
No. I've looked all over.

23:37.291 --> 23:40.569
I don't see a Noodles MacIntire.

23:40.669 --> 23:44.490
MacIntosh at your service.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.492
Yeah, George, never mind.
I think I found him.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.242
Come on! Come on!

23:59.605 --> 24:04.260
We go now live to U-62's
Pamela Finklestein

24:04.360 --> 24:06.469
on the steps at City Hall.

24:07.905 --> 24:11.309
Thank you. Hi.
Pamela Finklestein here.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.311
Boy, it's quite a scene this morning

24:13.411 --> 24:15.062
on the front steps of City Hall.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.231
We're awaiting the emergence
of Mayor Thompson

24:17.331 --> 24:19.942
from his annual city budget meeting.

24:20.042 --> 24:23.154
I think he... oh yeah, here comes
the mayor now. Let's go over.

24:23.254 --> 24:24.655
Maybe we can get a
few words out of him.

24:31.345 --> 24:33.162
Oh!

24:38.227 --> 24:41.796
Oh, did I do that?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.048
Oopsie!

24:44.692 --> 24:46.802
Noodles, those things are fragile.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.679
You should be more careful.

24:48.779 --> 24:51.766
Here he is now. I think
that we should be able...

24:51.866 --> 24:55.853
Hey, sweetheart, take my advice.

24:55.953 --> 24:59.273
Broads don't belong in broadcasting.

24:59.373 --> 25:00.691
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

25:00.791 --> 25:03.152
Hi. Richard Fletcher. Channel 8 news.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.038
Yeah, but...

25:14.138 --> 25:15.873
yeah, but...

25:15.973 --> 25:18.292
"broads don't belong
in broadcasting"?

25:18.392 --> 25:21.796
Is that the kind of professional
courtesy you teach your news department?

25:21.896 --> 25:23.881
Why, that's just terrible.

25:23.981 --> 25:26.384
I don't know how many times
I've told those boys

25:26.484 --> 25:28.844
never call chicks "broads."

25:28.944 --> 25:32.431
Why, you slimy... oh!

25:36.494 --> 25:39.063
Hello, and welcome to town talk.

25:39.163 --> 25:41.732
I'm George Newman,
and today our special guest

25:41.832 --> 25:44.693
is local high school
shop teacher Joe Earley.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.445
Joe, thanks for joining us.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.823
Thank you, home boy.

25:48.923 --> 25:50.741
Well, I see you've brought
some equipment with you today.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.618
Would you mind giving us
a little demonstration?

25:52.718 --> 25:56.247
Not at all.

25:56.347 --> 25:59.959
There's only a few simple principles

26:00.059 --> 26:02.086
you must bear in mind

26:02.186 --> 26:04.547
before attempting to operate

26:04.647 --> 26:09.508
a sophisticated piece
of machinery like this...

26:10.945 --> 26:12.553
Table saw.

26:22.540 --> 26:25.443
You know, lots of times,

26:25.543 --> 26:28.404
when my students first learn to...

26:28.504 --> 26:30.237
Whoa!

26:31.382 --> 26:33.451
What?

26:33.551 --> 26:35.409
Oh!

26:37.263 --> 26:39.748
Do you believe this?

26:39.848 --> 26:43.377
Oh, will you look at that?

26:43.477 --> 26:45.045
Oh.

26:45.145 --> 26:50.132
Just call me Mr. Butterfingers.

26:51.026 --> 26:54.680
I think it's on the floor...

26:54.780 --> 26:56.432
somewhere.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.225
Oh.

26:58.325 --> 27:03.104
Is my face red! Oh.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.108
Honey, where's the spatula?

27:08.043 --> 27:10.152
Okay, kids, let's go.

27:12.590 --> 27:14.450
There's just one place to go

27:14.550 --> 27:16.118
for all your spatula needs.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.162
Spatula City! Spatula City!

27:18.262 --> 27:21.290
A giant warehouse of
spatulas for every occasion.

27:21.390 --> 27:24.293
Thousands to choose from in
every shape, size, and color.

27:24.393 --> 27:26.045
And because we eliminate
the middleman,

27:26.145 --> 27:28.964
we can sell all our spatulas
factory-direct to you.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.675
Where do you go when you wanna
buy name-brand spatulas

27:31.775 --> 27:33.385
at a fraction of retail cost?

27:33.485 --> 27:35.221
Spatula City! Spatula City!

27:35.321 --> 27:38.974
And, this weekend only, take advantage
of our special liquidation sale.

27:39.074 --> 27:43.269
Buy 9 spatulas, get the 10th
one for just one penny.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.858
Don't forget, they make
great Christmas presents.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.819
And what better way
to say "I love you"

27:50.919 --> 27:53.405
than with the gift of a spatula?

27:53.505 --> 27:55.783
Spatula City! Spatula City!

27:55.883 --> 27:59.828
Hello. This is Sy Greenblum,
president of Spatula City.

27:59.928 --> 28:03.624
I liked their spatulas so much,
I bought the company.

28:03.724 --> 28:06.001
Spatula City! Seven locations!

28:06.101 --> 28:08.629
We're in the yellow
pages under "spatulas."

28:08.729 --> 28:12.673
My! Where did you get
that lovely spatula?

28:13.609 --> 28:16.387
<i>Spatula city, we sell spatulas</i>

28:16.487 --> 28:18.430
<i>And that's all</i>

28:27.665 --> 28:29.942
Hey, kids, where do you want to go?

28:30.042 --> 28:34.363
To Uncle Nutzy's clubhouse.

28:34.463 --> 28:37.032
That's right! I'm your Uncle Nutzy,

28:37.132 --> 28:42.415
and, boy, oh, boy are we gonna have
some big fun today. Huh, kids?

28:44.515 --> 28:48.711
Well, let's walk on over and see
who's in our Kiddie Corner.

28:48.811 --> 28:51.922
- Hi. What's your name?
- Billy.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.666
Billy what?

28:55.066 --> 28:56.486
Okay.

28:58.786 --> 29:01.774
You know who that is? That's right.

29:01.874 --> 29:07.354
It's your pal, Bob-o the Clown! Yay!

29:12.751 --> 29:17.281
Hey, Bob-o, wanna play a game?
Okay, look up. Look down.

29:17.381 --> 29:19.490
Now look at Mr. Frying Pan.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.163
Bob-o fall down, go boom.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.458
Upsie-daisy.

29:27.558 --> 29:29.877
Say, Bob-o, what's wrong?

29:29.977 --> 29:33.405
Oh, I bet I know.
You're hungry, aren't you?

29:34.105 --> 29:36.133
Well, I know just what you want.

29:36.233 --> 29:41.930
Clowns and kids alike can't resist the
mouth-watering, lip-smacking taste

29:42.030 --> 29:45.559
of Mrs. Hockenburger's
Butter Cookies.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.436
Right, Bob-o?

29:47.536 --> 29:48.937
That's right!

29:49.037 --> 29:50.356
And, hey, Mom,

29:50.456 --> 29:52.316
they're nutritious, too!

29:52.416 --> 29:55.067
Just look at how much
Bob-o here likes them.

29:55.711 --> 29:58.322
That's good.

29:58.422 --> 29:59.865
And don't forget, kids,

29:59.965 --> 30:01.492
there's a nifty surprise

30:01.592 --> 30:05.494
inside every box of
Mrs. Hockenburger's...

30:09.349 --> 30:13.504
Bob-o's been eating
Yappy's Dog Treats.

30:13.604 --> 30:16.548
That's right, Yappy's Dog Treats.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.468
Your dog will love that real
liver and tuna taste...

30:21.111 --> 30:23.470
with just a hint of cheese.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.228
Hi. Pamela Finklestein here,

30:29.328 --> 30:31.980
coming to you with an interview
with Mr. Earl Ramsey.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.442
Now, Mr. Ramsey is the
president of the local chapter

30:35.542 --> 30:37.569
of the American Gun Association.

30:37.669 --> 30:41.031
Mr. Ramsey, is it correct to assume

30:41.131 --> 30:44.076
that your organization
is against gun control?

30:44.176 --> 30:48.330
Gun control is for wimps and Commies.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.748
Listen, let's get one thing straight.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.542
Guns don't kill people.

30:54.228 --> 30:57.339
- I do.
- Yes, well...

30:57.439 --> 31:00.968
This is a special bulletin
from the U-62 news room.

31:01.068 --> 31:03.011
Hi, Teri. It's George.

31:03.111 --> 31:04.763
Happy Birthday.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.641
Hey, how about if I take you
and your folks out to dinner?

31:07.741 --> 31:10.436
I'll meet you at Cafe
Francais at 7:30, okay?

31:10.536 --> 31:12.597
I love you.

31:15.415 --> 31:18.902
Are you tired of sloppy,
cut-rate funerals?

31:19.002 --> 31:22.281
You've tried the rest.
Now try the best.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.200
The Plots-R-Us Mortuary Service.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.203
Remember, there's always
plenty of free parking,

31:28.303 --> 31:30.873
and don't forget to visit
our new salad bar.

31:30.973 --> 31:32.750
Plots-R-Us,

31:32.850 --> 31:36.335
eternal peace at affordable prices.

31:36.979 --> 31:39.423
Dad-blamed Beverly Hills.

31:39.523 --> 31:42.342
There ain't a possum shank to be
bought around here at any price.

31:42.442 --> 31:45.888
What good is having $68,000,000?

31:45.988 --> 31:47.973
I ask you!

31:48.073 --> 31:51.852
Well, this morning is good for getting a
lot of papers signed for Mr. Drysdale.

31:51.952 --> 31:53.937
You was doing that
when I left here...

32:52.512 --> 32:53.831
Huh.

32:53.931 --> 32:55.749
<i>Now, lookie here, people</i>

32:55.849 --> 32:58.168
<i>Listen to my story</i>

32:58.268 --> 33:01.046
<i>A little story about a man named Jed</i>

33:01.146 --> 33:02.798
<i>You know something</i>

33:02.898 --> 33:04.633
<i>That poor mountaineer</i>

33:04.733 --> 33:08.011
<i>They say he barely
kept his family fed</i>

33:08.111 --> 33:09.638
<i>Now, let me tell you</i>

33:09.738 --> 33:12.015
<i>One day he was shooting</i>

33:12.115 --> 33:14.518
<i>Old Jed was shooting at some food</i>

33:14.618 --> 33:16.395
<i>When all of a sudden</i>

33:16.495 --> 33:19.106
<i>Right up from the ground there</i>

33:19.206 --> 33:21.733
<i>Well, there came a bubbling crude</i>

33:21.833 --> 33:23.151
<i>Oil, that is</i>

33:23.251 --> 33:25.654
<i>Well, maybe you call it</i>

33:25.754 --> 33:28.782
<i>Black gold or the Texas tea</i>

33:28.882 --> 33:32.160
<i>He gonna move next
to Mr. Drysdale</i>

33:32.260 --> 33:36.246
<i>And be a Beverly hillbilly</i>

33:38.934 --> 33:40.419
<i>Before you know it</i>

33:40.519 --> 33:42.880
<i>All the kinfolk are a-sayin'</i>

33:42.980 --> 33:46.133
<i>"Yeah, buddy, move away from there"</i>

33:46.233 --> 33:49.469
<i>That little Clampett got
his own cement pond</i>

33:49.569 --> 33:52.639
<i>That little Clampett,
he's a millionaire</i>

33:52.739 --> 33:54.474
<i>Now, everyone said</i>

33:54.574 --> 33:59.688
<i>"Californy is the place
that you ought to be"</i>

33:59.788 --> 34:03.025
<i>We got to load up
this here truck, now</i>

34:03.125 --> 34:06.860
<i>We got to move to Beverly...</i>

34:08.338 --> 34:10.364
<i>Hills, that is</i>

34:12.300 --> 34:14.326
<i>Swimming pools</i>

34:15.846 --> 34:18.746
<i>Move-a move-a movie stars</i>

34:20.266 --> 34:22.293
<i>Huh</i>

34:22.393 --> 34:23.962
<i>Look at that, look at that</i>

34:24.062 --> 34:25.839
<i>Beverly</i>

34:25.938 --> 34:27.424
<i>Beverly</i>

34:27.524 --> 34:29.801
<i>"Beverly Hillbillies"</i>

34:29.900 --> 34:31.678
<i>Y'all come back, now, hear?</i>

34:31.777 --> 34:34.514
<i>Beverly, Beverly</i>

34:34.614 --> 34:37.976
<i>"Beverly Hillbillies"</i>

34:38.076 --> 34:39.393
<i>Beverly</i>

34:39.494 --> 34:41.103
<i>Beverly</i>

34:41.204 --> 34:43.063
<i>Beverly...</i>

34:48.462 --> 34:50.112
George?

34:50.755 --> 34:52.531
Hey, George.

34:53.507 --> 34:56.244
I finished polishing
all the doorknobs.

34:56.344 --> 34:57.829
Is there anything else
you want me to do?

34:57.929 --> 34:59.957
No, Stanley. That's okay.

35:00.057 --> 35:02.751
It's getting pretty late.
Why don't you call it a night?

35:02.851 --> 35:05.712
Oh... do I have to?

35:05.812 --> 35:08.757
Yeah. Go on.
I'll see you in the morning.

35:08.857 --> 35:12.176
Okay. I'll see you.

35:14.571 --> 35:17.140
George, you know,
I was wondering, like...

35:17.240 --> 35:18.600
like, if you were traveling
through outer space,

35:18.700 --> 35:20.727
I mean, like, you're going real fast,
like the speed of light,

35:20.827 --> 35:23.605
you know, and all of a sudden,
you started screaming,

35:25.499 --> 35:28.151
Do you think that your
brain would blow up?

35:28.251 --> 35:31.363
Guys, I'm trying to work.
Do you mind?

35:31.463 --> 35:36.533
No, I... I don't mind.
Go... go right ahead.

35:37.594 --> 35:40.078
Do you mind, George?

35:43.642 --> 35:45.210
Would you care to order now?

35:45.310 --> 35:47.713
Oh, yeah. I think we'll have the...

35:47.813 --> 35:50.172
No, thank you. We'll wait.

35:52.359 --> 35:55.636
Are you sure he knows
what restaurant we're at?

36:05.872 --> 36:09.026
Well, I've got some good
news and some bad news.

36:09.126 --> 36:11.528
Okay, give me the bad news first.

36:11.628 --> 36:15.615
Well, given our present
financial situation,

36:15.715 --> 36:18.118
compounded by ongoing fixed expenses

36:18.218 --> 36:20.537
and outstanding invoices,

36:20.637 --> 36:24.540
I figure this station will be flat
broke by the end of the week.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.546
What's the good news?

36:31.189 --> 36:34.216
I lied. There is no good news.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.847
I never should have taken this job.

36:42.993 --> 36:45.769
I should have known it would
turn out like all the others.

36:48.665 --> 36:50.525
You know, for a short time there,

36:50.625 --> 36:53.026
I really thought this
was gonna be different.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.446
I just don't know anymore.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.954
Well, at least I've still got Teri.

37:07.434 --> 37:09.795
- What time is it?
- 9:30.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.514
Oh, no!

37:18.111 --> 37:19.721
Hello?

37:19.821 --> 37:22.224
George Newman? You are a selfish,

37:22.324 --> 37:25.268
thoughtless, insensitive creep,

37:25.368 --> 37:28.522
and from now on, you can
forget all my birthdays

37:28.622 --> 37:30.897
because we're through.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.832
Hey, kids, where do you want to go?

37:50.143 --> 37:54.588
That's right, to Uncle
Nutzy's Clubhouse.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.092
And, boy, oh, boy,

37:57.192 --> 38:00.804
are we gonna have big fun today.

38:00.904 --> 38:03.555
We're gonna have so much fun,

38:05.116 --> 38:07.644
we'll forget about
how miserable we are

38:07.744 --> 38:10.564
and how much life sucks

38:10.664 --> 38:14.067
and how we're all gonna
grow old and die someday.

38:14.167 --> 38:17.110
- I wanna go home.
- Shut up, you little weasel.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.657
Okay.

38:20.757 --> 38:25.120
Right now I'd like to show you
one of my favorite cartoons.

38:25.220 --> 38:29.956
It's a sad, depressing story
about a pathetic coyote

38:30.600 --> 38:33.211
who spends every waking
moment of his life

38:33.311 --> 38:36.882
in the futile pursuit of
a sadistic roadrunner...

38:36.982 --> 38:39.342
who mocks him and laughs at him

38:39.442 --> 38:42.886
as he is repeatedly
crushed and maimed!

38:43.655 --> 38:45.972
Hope you enjoy it!

38:48.285 --> 38:50.645
Hey, where are you going?

38:50.745 --> 38:52.564
- I need a drink.
- You don't drink.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.858
Yeah, but I've been meaning to start.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.985
Wait a minute.

38:57.085 --> 38:58.778
What about the rest of the show?

38:58.878 --> 39:02.991
Watch out, Mr. Coyote!
Oh, that's terrible.

39:03.091 --> 39:05.035
Hey, Stanley.

39:05.135 --> 39:06.453
Yeah, George?

39:06.553 --> 39:08.495
How would you like your own TV Show?

39:09.431 --> 39:10.916
Okay.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.834
You're on.

39:12.934 --> 39:15.919
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

39:18.732 --> 39:21.174
What?

39:28.616 --> 39:31.519
- But, George, what about...
- Bob, it doesn't matter anymore.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.980
It's over.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.690
Yeah. We're watching it, too.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.984
Yeah. I've never seen
anything like it.

39:38.084 --> 39:39.943
Okay, I'll call you later.

39:41.463 --> 39:43.323
Gentlemen, what can I get you?

39:43.423 --> 39:44.991
Beer.

39:45.091 --> 39:47.159
Blueberry daiquiri.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.624
I'll tell you what, George.
Let's start fresh.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.167
Start a whole new business.

39:54.267 --> 39:56.253
Maybe we can borrow some money
from your Uncle Harvey.

39:56.353 --> 39:57.879
Oh, right.

39:57.979 --> 40:00.298
We just flushed his TV
station down the toilet.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.758
I'm sure he'd be happy
to lend us money.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.971
So I guess Teri's never going
to speak to you again, huh?

40:13.078 --> 40:14.604
Hey, I didn't get an umbrella.

40:14.704 --> 40:17.606
Look everybody! He's coming back on!

40:19.000 --> 40:22.570
Hey, welcome back to "Stanley
Spadowski's Clubhouse."

40:22.670 --> 40:24.239
Are you kids having a good time?

40:24.339 --> 40:26.199
Yeah!

40:26.299 --> 40:29.244
Hey, how about that cartoon?
That was a weird cartoon, wasn't it?

40:29.344 --> 40:33.123
You know, that cartoon, it reminds
me of a dream I had last week.

40:33.223 --> 40:36.334
I turned into a bird
with a candy-bar head.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.752
And there were these
other birds, you know,

40:37.852 --> 40:40.630
they were all trying to eat my head and
everything, but I got away from them.

40:40.730 --> 40:42.090
Then there was this tree, you know,

40:42.190 --> 40:43.758
and there was this weird
lizard, you know...

40:43.858 --> 40:45.468
what the...

40:45.568 --> 40:47.053
ooh!

40:47.153 --> 40:48.471
Oh.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.056
Whoa!

40:50.156 --> 40:51.599
Whoa!

40:51.699 --> 40:53.018
Oh!

40:53.118 --> 40:55.687
I wa... I wanna show you something...

40:55.787 --> 40:57.938
I want to show you something.

41:04.838 --> 41:06.906
This is my new mop.

41:07.006 --> 41:09.868
George, my friend,
he gave me this mop.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.121
It's a pretty good mop.
It's not as good as my first mop.

41:13.221 --> 41:17.125
I miss my first mop,
but this is still a good mop.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.836
Sometimes you just have to
take what life gives you

41:19.936 --> 41:22.797
'cause life is like a mop,

41:22.897 --> 41:26.718
and sometimes life gets
full of dirt and crud

41:26.818 --> 41:29.346
and bugs and hairballs and stuff.

41:29.446 --> 41:31.431
You... you... you gotta clean it out.

41:31.531 --> 41:34.434
You... you gotta put it
in here and rinse it off

41:34.534 --> 41:36.436
and start all over again and...

41:36.536 --> 41:40.148
and sometimes, sometimes life
sticks to the floor so bad,

41:40.248 --> 41:41.566
you know, a mop... a mop,

41:41.666 --> 41:42.984
it's not good enough...
it's not good enough.

41:43.084 --> 41:45.236
You... you gotta get down there,
like, with a toothbrush, you know,

41:45.336 --> 41:47.072
and you gotta...
you gotta really scrub.

41:47.172 --> 41:50.325
You gotta get it off!
You gotta really try to get it off.

41:50.425 --> 41:53.870
But if that doesn't work, if that
doesn't work, you can't give up.

41:53.970 --> 41:55.455
You gotta... you gotta
stand right up,

41:55.555 --> 41:57.957
you gotta run to a window, and say,

41:58.057 --> 42:00.877
"Hey! These floors are dirty as hell

42:00.977 --> 42:03.213
and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"

42:03.313 --> 42:09.759
- Yeah!
<i>- His truth is marching on.</i>

42:11.070 --> 42:15.600
Yes, ma'am. That's right.
Stanley Spadowski.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.812
I don't think that he's married, no.

42:18.912 --> 42:21.272
Well, I think that he
went to Harvard.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.402
I'll see you kids later.

42:25.502 --> 42:29.280
Hi, George. Well,
I finished with the TV show.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.282
What do you want me to do now?

42:31.382 --> 42:32.826
Did you have a good
time in there, Stanley?

42:32.926 --> 42:34.953
Yeah! Oh, boy, it was fun.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.539
Great! How'd you like
to do it every day?

42:37.639 --> 42:39.207
Yeah! That would be nea...

42:39.307 --> 42:42.335
wait a minute.

42:42.435 --> 42:44.671
Do I still get to be the janitor?

42:44.771 --> 42:46.923
Sure.

42:47.023 --> 42:50.927
Oh, okay. It's a deal.

42:51.027 --> 42:53.511
Well, I'm gonna go
clean the bathroom.

42:58.243 --> 43:01.479
Okay, kids, where do you want to go?

43:01.579 --> 43:05.942
To "Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse"!

43:06.042 --> 43:07.360
Yay!

43:11.965 --> 43:14.242
Great.

43:14.342 --> 43:16.828
All right, it's a deal. Thanks a lot.

43:16.928 --> 43:19.330
Okay, talk to you later.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.874
George, wait till you hear this.

43:20.974 --> 43:23.460
"Stanley Spadowski's
Clubhouse" is sold out

43:23.560 --> 43:24.878
for the next three months.

43:24.978 --> 43:27.422
The sponsors love him.

43:27.522 --> 43:29.466
You know, if we had a
few more shows like this,

43:29.566 --> 43:31.426
we'd really be in business.

43:31.526 --> 43:33.011
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

43:33.111 --> 43:34.888
I've been working on some new ideas.

43:34.988 --> 43:36.930
Tell me what you think.

43:40.577 --> 43:43.480
Today, one of these lucky contestants

43:43.580 --> 43:46.024
will win his or her weight in fish

43:46.124 --> 43:47.484
right here on...

43:47.584 --> 43:49.736
"Wheel of Fish"!

43:53.298 --> 43:55.992
Okay, let's play the game.

43:56.092 --> 43:58.077
We'll start with yesterday's winner,

43:58.177 --> 43:59.746
Miss Phyllis Weaver.

44:01.306 --> 44:02.832
Are you ready, Weaver?

44:02.932 --> 44:04.751
I sure am, Kuni.

44:04.851 --> 44:07.752
Okay, you get over there
and spin the Wheel of Fish.

44:10.565 --> 44:12.050
Go ahead.

44:12.150 --> 44:14.260
Give it a big spin!

44:18.323 --> 44:19.933
Come on, big fish!

44:20.033 --> 44:22.434
Come to Mama! Come on!

44:24.245 --> 44:26.356
Oh...

44:26.456 --> 44:28.775
a red snapper.

44:28.875 --> 44:32.654
Very tasty.

44:32.754 --> 44:35.615
Okay, Weaver, listen carefully.

44:35.715 --> 44:38.576
You can hold onto your red snapper

44:38.676 --> 44:40.620
or you can go for what's in the box

44:40.720 --> 44:43.164
that Hiro-san is bringing
down the aisle right now!

44:43.264 --> 44:45.790
What's it gonna be?

44:47.477 --> 44:49.335
Box! Fish!

44:54.567 --> 44:56.761
I'll take the box! The box!

44:56.861 --> 44:59.681
You took the box!

44:59.781 --> 45:02.684
Let's see what's in the box!

45:06.996 --> 45:08.648
Nothing!

45:08.748 --> 45:11.359
Absolutely nothing!

45:11.459 --> 45:16.197
Stupid! You're so stupid!

45:28.685 --> 45:30.003
Hello.

45:30.103 --> 45:31.879
My name is Philo,

45:31.979 --> 45:33.963
and welcome to...

45:39.112 --> 45:43.431
"Secrets of the Universe."

45:45.076 --> 45:49.314
Today we are going to
learn to make plutonium

45:49.414 --> 45:51.815
from common household items.

45:52.709 --> 45:55.069
Hey, man. This is Raul Hernandez,

45:55.169 --> 45:58.114
and welcome to...
Raul's Wild Kingdom,

45:58.214 --> 46:01.284
coming to you live from my apartment.

46:01.384 --> 46:02.702
How about that, huh?

46:02.802 --> 46:04.787
Okay, first thing
we're gonna do today

46:04.887 --> 46:07.248
is check out the wonderful
world of turtles.

46:09.851 --> 46:11.252
This is my friend Tommy.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.630
Tommy, say hello to the nice people.

46:13.730 --> 46:15.673
Hello. Ha! Isn't he great, huh?

46:15.773 --> 46:19.218
Okay, so, the turtle is a
member of the reptile family,

46:19.318 --> 46:21.763
and he's got this hard,
protective shell

46:21.863 --> 46:23.806
which keeps predators away,

46:23.906 --> 46:26.309
also provides him with his
own home when he sleeps.

46:26.409 --> 46:29.228
Oh, and he's got these
tiny, teeny little legs

46:29.328 --> 46:31.938
which makes him move real slow.

46:32.707 --> 46:34.609
And not too many people know this,

46:34.709 --> 46:40.324
but the turtle is also nature's
suction cup. Watch this.

46:41.424 --> 46:44.035
Did you see that? It sticks! Ha!

46:44.135 --> 46:46.162
Okay. Oh yeah.
What else I got for you?

46:46.262 --> 46:48.623
Yeah, check this out.

46:48.723 --> 46:51.959
This is my ant farm.
Now, ants are amazing.

46:52.059 --> 46:55.171
They can carry 50 times
their own weight,

46:55.271 --> 46:57.173
and they work for weeks and weeks

46:57.273 --> 46:59.842
building these intricate
little tunnels.

46:59.942 --> 47:03.887
And, oh, yeah, they hate
it when you do this.

47:05.948 --> 47:07.975
Oh, look!

47:08.075 --> 47:10.560
They're really mad now.

47:11.204 --> 47:13.815
Where did you find this guy?

47:13.915 --> 47:16.901
Me? I thought you hired him.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.653
For those of you just joining us,

47:18.753 --> 47:21.280
today we're teaching
poodles how to fly.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.282
Come here, come here, Foofie.

47:23.382 --> 47:26.577
Foofie, are you psyched?

47:26.677 --> 47:29.080
Are you ready? Okay.

47:29.180 --> 47:30.915
Here we go.

47:31.015 --> 47:34.793
Get ready and fly!

47:36.011 --> 47:38.062
Oh, man.

47:40.316 --> 47:42.760
You know, sometimes it
takes them a little longer

47:42.860 --> 47:44.470
to learn how to do it right.

47:44.570 --> 47:46.347
Okay, come on, come on,
come on, shut up, shut up.

47:46.447 --> 47:49.183
Hey, hey. Who's next? Gigi.

47:52.077 --> 47:54.105
Oh, man!

47:56.207 --> 47:58.860
Hi. This is Teri.
I'm not home right now,

47:58.960 --> 48:02.238
so leave a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.

48:02.838 --> 48:05.992
Teri, I'm sorry!

48:06.092 --> 48:09.787
Come on, give me one
more chance, please!

48:09.887 --> 48:11.456
Come on, Teri!

48:11.556 --> 48:14.459
Teri! Oh, oh! I'm in hell!

48:14.559 --> 48:17.378
I'm in hell! Teri!

48:17.478 --> 48:20.298
Teri, pick up the phone!

48:20.398 --> 48:22.675
Pick up the phone! Pick up the phone!

48:22.775 --> 48:25.970
Oh! Oh, Teri!

48:26.070 --> 48:28.014
Please!

48:28.114 --> 48:30.183
Oh, Teri!

48:34.787 --> 48:37.563
Richard, you shouldn't have.

48:38.499 --> 48:41.194
Happy Father's Day, Dad.

48:43.212 --> 48:44.572
What is this piece of crap?

48:44.672 --> 48:46.949
I thought I told you
I wanted a Rolex!

48:47.049 --> 48:49.294
A Rolex!

48:49.594 --> 48:52.079
- What?
- Sir?

48:52.179 --> 48:53.656
What do you want?

48:53.756 --> 48:56.167
I just thought I ought to tell you, sir,
there's a lot of talk in the street

48:56.267 --> 48:58.211
about this Channel 62.

48:58.311 --> 49:01.130
They're starting to get a
pretty strong following.

49:01.230 --> 49:05.927
Excuse me? Did you say Channel 62?

49:06.027 --> 49:10.515
Do I have to remind you that
we are a network affiliate?

49:10.615 --> 49:13.226
And we're in competition
with other networks,

49:13.326 --> 49:16.270
not with a bunch of punks
broadcasting out of a closet!

49:16.370 --> 49:19.482
- But, sir...
- Do you enjoy wasting my time?

49:19.582 --> 49:21.901
Get out of my office!

49:22.001 --> 49:24.444
And take that ridiculous thing off!

49:50.738 --> 49:53.391
What's that mean? What's that mean?

50:04.335 --> 50:06.195
We got a winner!

50:06.295 --> 50:08.030
We got a winner!

50:08.130 --> 50:10.700
Oh, Joel Miller,

50:10.800 --> 50:13.035
you just found the
marble in the oatmeal.

50:13.135 --> 50:14.704
You're a lucky, lucky,
lucky little boy.

50:14.804 --> 50:16.122
'Cause you know why?

50:16.222 --> 50:19.041
You get to drink from the fire hose!

50:26.273 --> 50:28.467
<i>Yippee-ei-a</i>

50:28.567 --> 50:31.302
So much fun. So much fun.

50:33.114 --> 50:35.766
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah!

50:35.866 --> 50:37.767
Open wide!

50:39.161 --> 50:40.938
Whoa ho ho!

50:41.038 --> 50:43.439
Joel Miller! Let's hear it for him!

50:45.459 --> 50:47.528
- Raul Hernandez?
- Yeah.

50:47.628 --> 50:49.071
Got the delivery here
for your next show.

50:49.171 --> 50:50.907
Oh, great. What you got?

50:51.007 --> 50:54.911
Well, let's see, I got one
aardvark, one flamingo,

50:55.011 --> 51:00.081
four porcupines,
two armadillos, three badgers.

51:00.933 --> 51:02.793
Badgers?

51:02.893 --> 51:04.795
Badgers?

51:04.895 --> 51:07.922
We don't need no stinking badgers!

51:47.855 --> 51:51.258
Never before in the history
of motion pictures

51:51.358 --> 51:53.052
has there been a screen presence

51:53.152 --> 51:56.097
so commanding, so powerful,

51:56.197 --> 51:58.599
so deadly.

51:58.699 --> 52:01.560
He's Conan the Librarian.

52:01.660 --> 52:05.271
Can you tell me where I can
find a book on astronomy?

52:08.459 --> 52:13.114
Don't you know the
Dewey decimal system?

52:13.214 --> 52:15.533
Conan the Librarian.

52:15.633 --> 52:17.243
I'm sorry.

52:17.343 --> 52:19.453
These books are a little overdue.

52:21.472 --> 52:23.040
Conan the Librarian.

52:23.140 --> 52:27.502
Tonight, only on U-62.

52:29.730 --> 52:32.006
This is pretty good water...

52:34.568 --> 52:36.971
tastes like poop.

52:37.071 --> 52:40.016
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
eat some corn flakes.

52:40.116 --> 52:42.476
These are good corn...

52:42.576 --> 52:44.353
whoa!

52:44.453 --> 52:46.856
"Free toy inside." "Free toy inside."

52:46.956 --> 52:49.649
Let's find it.

52:51.168 --> 52:54.363
Don't let your mom
know that you do this.

52:54.463 --> 52:57.408
I want to find the toy.

52:57.508 --> 53:00.161
Oh, look! It's a toy man.

53:00.261 --> 53:01.787
It's a toy man.

53:01.887 --> 53:03.873
Hey. Wanna go for a ride?

53:03.973 --> 53:05.499
Oh, boy! Is it fun?

53:05.599 --> 53:07.668
Here, I'll just tie this
around your waist.

53:07.768 --> 53:10.963
Oh... wait a minute!
No, I'll show you.

53:11.063 --> 53:12.381
I don't want to go...

53:14.608 --> 53:16.594
Stop! Stop!

53:16.694 --> 53:18.012
Wasn't that fun?

53:18.112 --> 53:20.890
Oh, stop! I'm dizzy!
No, let's go again.

53:23.075 --> 53:25.936
Okay. How's this for our
new Friday night line-up?

53:26.036 --> 53:28.731
8:00, "Druids On Parade,"

53:28.831 --> 53:31.275
then "The Volcano Worshipers' Hour,"

53:31.375 --> 53:33.652
followed by "Underwater
Bingo for Teens"

53:33.752 --> 53:37.364
and "Fun with Dirt."

53:37.464 --> 53:39.158
Why not?

53:39.258 --> 53:40.701
Get this. I get a call this morning

53:40.801 --> 53:43.037
from a guy who says he
can swallow his own face.

53:43.137 --> 53:45.206
Can you believe that? I...

53:45.306 --> 53:46.999
Bob?

53:47.099 --> 53:50.252
- What you got there?
- The ratings.

53:50.352 --> 53:52.421
Don't tell me we actually
showed up on the list.

53:52.521 --> 53:54.965
We're number one.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.550
Say what?

53:58.611 --> 54:01.138
W-we beat out the networks.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.766
Th-this is unbelievable.
Look at these numbers.

54:03.866 --> 54:05.935
We've got three shows
in the top five.

54:06.035 --> 54:08.354
"Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse"
went through the roof.

54:08.454 --> 54:11.899
He got a 60 share!
Do you know what this means?

54:11.999 --> 54:14.527
We're finally gonna
have some real money.

54:14.627 --> 54:17.905
George, we're the number
one station in town.

54:20.591 --> 54:22.409
There's lots of fun coming your way

54:22.509 --> 54:24.745
this weekend on U-62.

54:24.845 --> 54:26.914
First, slam your way to health

54:27.014 --> 54:29.208
as you "Stay fit!"
With Mike and Spike.

54:29.308 --> 54:33.003
Next, everybody's favorite,
Chef Bernie invites you to go...

54:33.103 --> 54:34.880
"Bowling for Burgers"!

54:34.980 --> 54:36.632
Sunday, be a part of the excitement

54:36.732 --> 54:38.801
as we premiere our
dazzling new game show

54:38.901 --> 54:40.344
"Strip solitaire"!

54:40.444 --> 54:44.014
And then join us for some
hilarious fun on the all-new

54:44.114 --> 54:46.142
"Practical Jokes and Bloopers"!

54:46.242 --> 54:48.936
And you won't want to miss
"Celebrity Mud Wrestling,"

54:49.036 --> 54:52.189
with this week's special guest,
Mikhail Gorbachev.

54:52.289 --> 54:54.400
Whoa!

54:54.500 --> 54:56.986
It's a whole new weekend on U-62,

54:57.086 --> 54:59.155
the reason television was invented.

54:59.255 --> 55:02.198
Be there! Huh huh, yah.

55:06.637 --> 55:11.000
This is indeed a sad
day for Channel 8.

55:11.100 --> 55:13.669
We've been number one in this
town for the past 10 years

55:13.769 --> 55:17.298
and now our sponsors are
pulling their accounts.

55:17.398 --> 55:20.634
We're losing valuable
advertising revenue.

55:20.734 --> 55:23.971
We're losing credibility
in the market.

55:24.071 --> 55:25.598
And, why?

55:25.698 --> 55:28.726
Because of some
fly-by-night UHF station!

55:28.826 --> 55:32.354
A UHF station!

55:32.454 --> 55:35.274
This is an embarrassment, a disgrace!

55:35.374 --> 55:39.987
What do you think R.J. Fletcher, Sr.
would be saying if he were alive today?

55:40.087 --> 55:43.282
"Help, let me out of this box.
I can't breathe in here.

55:43.382 --> 55:45.616
Help. Let me out."

55:47.428 --> 55:48.996
We've gotta do something.

55:49.096 --> 55:51.497
We've gotta do it fast.

55:54.435 --> 55:58.255
Who owns that station, anyway?

55:58.355 --> 56:01.967
<i>Let me be your hog</i>

56:02.067 --> 56:04.887
<i>Let me be your hog, now...</i>

56:06.864 --> 56:08.807
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby</i>

56:08.907 --> 56:11.417
<i>baby, baby, baby...</i>

56:12.995 --> 56:15.648
Yo! Heh, heh.

56:15.748 --> 56:18.192
Hey, Big Louie. What's happening?

56:18.292 --> 56:20.694
Bad news, Mr. Bilchik.

56:20.794 --> 56:22.780
None of your horses came in.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.907
Oh, that's too bad.

56:25.007 --> 56:28.327
So, what's the damages, huh?

56:28.427 --> 56:31.412
$75,000.

56:35.225 --> 56:36.794
Oh, excuse me, Louie.

56:36.894 --> 56:39.630
I think I got a little
water in the phone here.

56:39.730 --> 56:42.341
How much did you say that was again?

56:42.441 --> 56:45.219
$75,000.

56:45.319 --> 56:48.264
I'll be expecting
payment in two days.

56:48.364 --> 56:50.474
Two days?

56:50.574 --> 56:51.892
Hey, listen, Louie.

56:51.992 --> 56:54.937
I might need a little
bit more time, huh?

56:55.037 --> 56:57.564
Friday night, 10:00.

56:57.664 --> 57:01.108
75,000 in cash.

57:07.383 --> 57:09.825
I'm dead meat.

57:20.104 --> 57:22.256
- Yeah, what?
- Mr. Bilchik?

57:22.356 --> 57:24.298
This is R.J. Fletcher.

57:32.199 --> 57:33.517
Can I help you?

57:33.617 --> 57:36.101
No, thanks. Just taking
a few measurements.

57:44.002 --> 57:46.071
Wait a minute. I think I
missed something here.

57:46.171 --> 57:47.990
Oh, didn't I tell you?

57:48.090 --> 57:49.867
I own this place now.

57:49.967 --> 57:51.452
You what?

57:51.552 --> 57:54.038
What's the matter, kid,
you got wax in your ears?

57:54.138 --> 57:55.456
But my uncle Harvey...

57:55.556 --> 57:57.541
Harvey Bilchik is flying in
tonight to close the deal.

57:57.641 --> 57:59.043
I don't believe this.

57:59.143 --> 58:01.003
- Hold this, kid.
- George, do something.

58:01.103 --> 58:03.255
Hey! W-wait a minute.

58:03.355 --> 58:05.341
Don't you already own Channel 8?

58:05.441 --> 58:09.134
I mean, isn't it illegal to own two
television stations in the same town?

58:10.154 --> 58:12.765
Oh...

58:12.865 --> 58:14.183
really?

58:14.283 --> 58:15.851
Gee...

58:15.951 --> 58:18.270
I guess I'll have to turn this
place into a parking lot.

58:20.539 --> 58:23.190
Toodle-oo! Ha ha ha!

58:32.009 --> 58:34.161
Harvey, I still don't understand

58:34.261 --> 58:35.829
what this is all about.

58:35.929 --> 58:37.706
I told you, I just gotta wrap
up a little business deal,

58:37.806 --> 58:39.124
and I'll be back in a few days

58:39.224 --> 58:41.960
and I'll tell you about it then?

58:42.060 --> 58:44.671
You take care of yourself, you hear?

58:44.771 --> 58:47.631
- Bye.
- Bye.

58:52.362 --> 58:53.972
Hello?

58:54.072 --> 58:56.600
Oh, hi, George.

58:56.700 --> 58:58.685
It's so good to hear from you.

58:58.785 --> 59:00.978
How's everything?

59:02.372 --> 59:04.773
He what?

59:05.417 --> 59:09.153
Harvey Bilchik, get in here!

59:15.719 --> 59:17.621
Uncle Harvey, at least
give me a chance

59:17.721 --> 59:19.665
to match his offer.

59:19.765 --> 59:21.750
Well, let me worry about

59:21.850 --> 59:24.169
where I'm going to come
up with the money.

59:24.269 --> 59:28.424
Yeah. 75,000 in cash by Friday night.

59:28.524 --> 59:30.592
10:00. Yeah, I got it.

59:30.692 --> 59:32.302
Okay.

59:32.402 --> 59:33.720
Okay.

59:33.820 --> 59:35.512
Okay, bye.

59:36.907 --> 59:38.392
Oh, George,

59:38.492 --> 59:40.561
where are you gonna come up
with that kind of money?

59:40.661 --> 59:43.439
Yeah, and what are you
gonna do about Fletcher?

59:43.539 --> 59:45.441
Fletcher...

59:45.541 --> 59:48.527
yeah, I wouldn't put
anything past that guy.

59:48.627 --> 59:52.655
If there were only some way
we could keep an eye on him.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:41.413
Continental flight 414 now arriving

01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:44.873
from Los Angeles at gate seven.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:54.216
Hey.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.430
Harvey.

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.307
Harvey Bilchik.

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:03.477
Great to see you. R.J. Fletcher.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:06.146
- Did you have a good flight?
- Yeah.

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:08.232
- Want some peanuts?
- No, thank you.

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:12.152
Mr. Bilchik,
while you're here in town,

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:14.738
I want to make sure that
you're very comfortable.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:18.158
Anything special you want,
you just let me know.

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:22.246
Now... what do you say we
take care of a little business?

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:25.207
I've got all the cash right here.

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:27.626
And as soon as you sign these,

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:30.379
- we can start celebrating.
- Yeah, well, listen...

01:01:30.479 --> 01:01:32.256
I-I-I gotta talk to you about that.

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:33.674
What? What's wrong?

01:01:33.774 --> 01:01:35.509
Well, you see, the thing is, that,

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:37.886
I promised George that
I'd give him a chance

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.805
to get all the money by Friday night.

01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:41.974
What are you talking about?
We had a deal!

01:01:42.074 --> 01:01:43.809
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that,

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.978
but it's just something I had to do.
Don't worry about it.

01:01:46.078 --> 01:01:47.479
There's no possible way

01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:49.189
that kid can come up
with 75,000 bucks

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:51.398
in two days.

01:01:58.006 --> 01:01:59.950
George Newman.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.535
He starts where the others stop.

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:04.121
Sex with furniture...
what do you think?

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:07.374
The world watched in amazement
as he unlocked the mysteries

01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:09.585
of Al Capone's glove compartment.

01:02:09.685 --> 01:02:11.420
Aha!

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.338
Road maps!

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.340
He blew the lid off Satanism.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.259
Look, all I was trying to say...

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:19.219
Oh, shut up, you pinhead!

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:20.762
You make me sick!

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:22.472
Sometimes shocking,

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:25.183
always controversial,
he deals with topics

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:27.853
that the other talk shows
are afraid to touch.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:31.398
He pries, he pokes, he digs deep.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:34.026
He gets the answers.
He gets the facts.

01:02:34.126 --> 01:02:36.653
And most of all, he gets the ratings.

01:02:42.134 --> 01:02:45.329
Lesbian Nazi hookers abducted by UFOs

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:47.331
and forced into
weight-loss programs...

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:50.290
all this week on "Town Talk."

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:08.477
George, what's the matter?

01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:11.521
Stanley, you don't wanna know.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.730
Well...

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:16.608
why'd I ask?

01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:24.576
Is there something I can do to help?

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:27.870
Not unless you've got $75,000.

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:36.797
Let's see...

01:03:36.897 --> 01:03:39.675
no, sorry.

01:03:39.775 --> 01:03:42.761
This is ridiculous.

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:45.345
There must be something I could do.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:54.648
The U-62 telethon is on the air!

01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:02.406
Hey, Dad,

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.408
you'd better turn on Channel 62.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.075
Something funny's going on.

01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:13.417
Now, we're not asking for donations.

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.293
What we are doing
is offering this town

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:17.462
a unique business opportunity.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:22.509
This is one share of
stock in Channel 62.

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:25.470
Our goal over the next day and a half

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:28.473
is to sell 7,500 of these

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:30.517
at $10 apiece.

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:34.354
If we succeed, then the station
will belong to all of us.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.648
Now, I'm calling out an SOS!

01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:40.026
"Save Our Station."

01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:42.654
We got volunteers right over here.
They'll be taking your money.

01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:45.407
They're gonna be working
around the clock for two days

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:47.951
until every share is sold.

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.203
What do you say, kids? Can we do it?

01:05:02.858 --> 01:05:06.428
I think it's time you boys paid

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:11.265
our Mr. Spadowski a little visit.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:17.147
Yeah, I'm calling you on
behalf of our station.

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:18.690
We're having this telethon.
We're trying...

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:21.026
we're really raising a lot of
money here for the channel.

01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:24.029
We'd really appreciate
it if you could help us.

01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:25.697
Well, you...
bring your dogs down here.

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:27.657
I'll wash them for you.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.951
Huh?

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:31.453
Well, so far, guys,

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:33.789
your response has
really been incredible,

01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:36.666
but we've still got a long way to go.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:39.544
Remember, when you buy stock in U-62,

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:43.048
you're not only helping
yourself and your community...

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:45.133
You're doing great, Stanley.

01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:47.594
Now, remember,
you gotta pace yourself.

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:49.554
You got a long way to go
before tomorrow night.

01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:51.847
Yeah, I can do it,
George. I can do it.

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:55.769
All right, now, just take it easy.

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:01.399
- Is there anything I can get you?
- Some Play-Doh.

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:02.943
Okay.

01:06:03.043 --> 01:06:04.861
No, no, no, George,
get me some bubbles,

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:08.905
- some real big bubbles.
- I'll see what I can do.

01:06:16.688 --> 01:06:17.833
Who is it?

01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:21.253
Got a pizza here for
Mr. Stanley Spadowski.

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:25.047
Pizza? For me? Oh, boy!

01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:29.845
I like peppers.

01:06:29.945 --> 01:06:31.805
But I love anchovies

01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:33.682
because they're real fishy.

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:35.851
Sometimes I just like to get a pizza

01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:37.602
with nothing on it but anchovies.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:39.521
No peppers or olives or onions.

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:42.482
Just anchovies 'cause they're good.

01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:45.151
So, are we going to kill him?

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:48.154
No. The boss just wants us
to keep him on ice for a while.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.447
Easy, easy.

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:52.576
Hey, wait a minute.

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:55.494
You guys aren't from the pizza place.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.466
Oh, George! George,
you've got to do something.

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:11.136
Every minute that Stanley's not
on the air, we're losing money.

01:07:11.236 --> 01:07:14.097
Yeah. Listen, just stall
as long as you can.

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:16.099
- I'm sure he'll turn up.
- Okay.

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:18.184
- What did the police say?
- They're doing everything they can.

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:21.686
I'm telling you, George,
Fletcher's behind this. I just know it.

01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:34.284
Okay. I'm thinking of something...

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:35.827
orange.

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:37.704
Something orange.

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:39.623
Orange.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:41.708
You give up?

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:43.868
It's an orange. Get it?

01:07:44.468 --> 01:07:46.004
This is fun, huh?

01:07:46.104 --> 01:07:48.173
Okay. Now I'm thinking
of something...

01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:49.716
blue.

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:52.218
Something blue.

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:54.304
Let me kill him.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.681
Please, let me kill him.

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.109
What?

01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:13.281
Wh... what?

01:08:13.381 --> 01:08:15.490
Oh...

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.537
what?

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:22.497
Don't you like "Bonanza"?

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:39.389
Okay, Philo, go to commercial.

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:46.523
Next week on U-62...

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.484
He's back,

01:08:49.584 --> 01:08:53.444
and this time, he's mad.

01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:55.782
"Gandhi II"!

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.493
No more Mr. Passive Resistance.

01:08:58.593 --> 01:09:00.078
He's out to kick some butt.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.165
This is one bad mother

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:06.167
you don't wanna mess with.

01:09:06.267 --> 01:09:08.417
Yah!

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:13.591
Don't move, slimeball.

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:19.179
He's a one-man wrecking crew.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:24.309
But he also knows how to party.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:28.439
Give me a steak, medium rare.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.442
Hey, baldy!

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:32.234
There is only one law...

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:34.361
his law.

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:39.282
"Gandhi II"!

01:09:41.136 --> 01:09:43.703
Hey, mister!

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:47.042
Change? You got change?

01:09:47.142 --> 01:09:48.710
Do you mind? Get out of my way.

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:52.421
Hey, come on.
Can't you help a guy out?

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:54.548
Anything.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:01.555
Don't spend it all in one place.

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:08.521
I can't believe it!

01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:10.815
Oh, thanks, mister.

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:12.817
Thanks a lot!

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:29.334
Mr. Fletcher?

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:31.544
May I speak to you for a moment?

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.130
Personnel's that way, young lady.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.257
No, I'm not here about a job.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:38.885
I'd like to talk to
you about Channel 62.

01:10:38.985 --> 01:10:41.262
Channel 62? Oh, yes.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:43.056
My demolition team is looking forward

01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:45.600
to turning it into a rubble
heap Saturday morning.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.477
Wait a minute.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:50.438
Will you please just listen?

01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:52.649
George Newman has
turned that little station

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.818
into something this
community cares about.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:57.779
George Newman is
a two-bit little punk

01:10:57.879 --> 01:11:00.073
who should never have stuck
his nose where it didn't belong.

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:02.408
And if he sent you here
to try to make a deal...

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:04.702
George doesn't know I'm here.

01:11:04.802 --> 01:11:07.205
Look, it just seems to me that

01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:10.416
there's more than enough room
for both of you in this town.

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:11.876
Besides, a little competition

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:13.711
is always good for the community.

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:16.506
The community?
Let me tell you something.

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:19.050
This community means
about as much to me

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:22.552
as a festering bowl of dog snot.

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:33.982
You guys?

01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:35.942
Hey, you guys!

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:38.278
The blindfold fell off.

01:11:38.378 --> 01:11:40.071
You better come fix it.

01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:43.158
I didn't mean for it to... whoa!

01:11:43.258 --> 01:11:46.286
Hey, my shirt glows in the dark!

01:11:48.388 --> 01:11:50.790
Will you shut him up?

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:53.376
Oh, I got an itch. I got an itch.

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:55.251
I got an itch. I got an itch.

01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:59.382
I got an itch. I got an itch.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:02.133
- I got an itch, I got an itch.
- Stanley.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:04.804
I don't want to have
to tell you this again.

01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:07.640
Shut up.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.727
You're making us nuts.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:12.770
Now...

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:16.024
I got three guys out here

01:12:16.124 --> 01:12:20.193
that would love to
cut your tongue out,

01:12:21.296 --> 01:12:23.489
but I don't want them to do that.

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:26.868
I told them that in
another couple of hours

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:28.953
this whole thing will be over,.

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:32.874
So, Stanley, be nice.

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:35.500
My mop!

01:12:43.199 --> 01:12:44.685
Freeze!

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:54.812
- Hey!
- Get him!

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:57.148
- He's getting away!
- Let's get him!

01:12:57.248 --> 01:13:00.275
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Get out of my way!

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:49.240
Not gonna get me.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.174
Yeah.

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:18.770
Stanley.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:24.235
Don't move, Spadowski.

01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:27.320
Don't even breathe.

01:14:33.845 --> 01:14:37.163
Wh-what are we gonna do now?

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:40.375
I'll handle this.

01:17:11.586 --> 01:17:14.445
Ooh!

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:51.566
Whoa.

01:17:53.044 --> 01:17:54.986
Oh.

01:18:37.797 --> 01:18:39.365
Oh, boy!

01:19:00.695 --> 01:19:03.012
Who is this guy?

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:07.350
I'm your worst nightmare.

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:13.774
Listen, I can see you
guys are pretty busy.

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:15.818
How about if I just come back later?

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:17.445
Forget it, pal.

01:19:17.545 --> 01:19:20.072
We're all going for a little ride.

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:22.617
Oh. Well, we'll have
to take your car.

01:19:22.717 --> 01:19:24.285
Mine's a two-seater.

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:26.537
Just shut up, kid.

01:19:26.637 --> 01:19:29.707
You know, you really
botched things up.

01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:34.293
If you hadn't stuck your
face in our business...

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:38.131
we'd all be going home real soon.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:42.762
But now I'm gonna have to take you

01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:45.973
and your friend out of commission...

01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:48.224
for good.

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:51.562
Redrum!

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:53.187
Redrum!

01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:57.318
What was that? Hold on.

01:19:57.418 --> 01:19:59.695
- I thought I heard something.
- What?

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:03.699
- I don't know. I just thought...
- Supplies!

01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:21.175
Hey, everybody, they're back.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:35.521
Yeah!

01:21:05.653 --> 01:21:07.513
<i>Dee dee</i>

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:09.348
<i>Dee dee du dee dee</i>

01:21:09.448 --> 01:21:10.516
<i>Da da dee dee</i>

01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:12.892
<i>Da dee dee...</i>

01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:19.525
Friends,

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.903
there comes a time
in every man's life

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:25.573
where he has to look
the potato of injustice

01:21:25.673 --> 01:21:27.450
right in the eye.

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:30.661
There's a powerful evil
force in the universe.

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:33.038
And it lives at Channel 8.
And I've seen it,

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:37.126
and I don't want it to pop its ugly,
greasy head around here,

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:39.378
- do you?
- No!

01:21:39.478 --> 01:21:41.922
- I can't hear you!
- No!

01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:44.717
- I can't hear you!
- No!

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:47.762
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:51.390
All right, say it again.

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.809
- No!
- All right!

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.853
And now a special report

01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:58.355
from the owner and general
manager of Channel 8,

01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:00.357
R.J. Fletcher.

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:02.359
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:04.612
I come before you tonight

01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:06.113
to speak on a matter

01:22:06.213 --> 01:22:09.116
which is of grave concern to us all.

01:22:09.216 --> 01:22:11.452
I want to show you

01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:13.996
how one small television station

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:18.667
can single-handedly
disrupt and destroy

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:22.087
the moral fiber of
an entire community.

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:25.424
The following may upset you.

01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:27.426
It may even shock you.

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:33.557
But I feel it is my duty
as a concerned citizen

01:22:33.657 --> 01:22:38.185
to bring you this important message.

01:22:40.414 --> 01:22:42.733
This community means
about as much to me

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:45.694
as a festering bowl of dog snot.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:49.156
You think I care about the
pea-brained yokels of this town?

01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:53.369
If you took their combined
IQ and multiplied it by 100,

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:56.038
you might have enough
intelligence to tie your shoe,

01:22:56.138 --> 01:22:59.041
if you didn't drool all
over yourself first.

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:02.127
I can't stand those
sniveling maggots.

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:04.338
They make me want to puke.

01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:06.590
But there is one good
thing about broadcasting

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:09.802
to a town full of mindless sheep...

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:12.346
I always know I've got them

01:23:12.446 --> 01:23:15.349
exactly where I want them.

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:35.870
$73,000!

01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:40.541
We just hit the $73,000 mark!

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:43.002
Okay, Mouseketeers, come on.

01:23:43.102 --> 01:23:45.336
We can do it. Woo!

01:23:47.147 --> 01:23:49.632
What do you say, stranger?

01:23:50.401 --> 01:23:52.051
Teri.

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:55.306
What are you doing here?

01:23:55.406 --> 01:23:56.765
I thought you never
wanted to see me again.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:24:00.226
Well, whatever gave you that idea?

01:24:00.953 --> 01:24:02.479
Well, I think my first
clue was when you said

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:04.023
you never wanted to see me again.

01:24:04.123 --> 01:24:07.359
Oh. Well, George...

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:09.194
no matter what happens tonight,

01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:12.488
I just want you to know
that I'm so proud of you.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.914
Uncle Harvey.

01:24:20.014 --> 01:24:22.249
Listen, we'll definitely
have the money for you,

01:24:22.349 --> 01:24:24.752
it just may take a few minutes
longer than we expected.

01:24:24.852 --> 01:24:26.545
Look, kid, if it was up to me,

01:24:26.645 --> 01:24:28.422
I'd let you have all the time
you wanted, but you know,

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:31.759
Big Louie is a very punctual kind
of guy, you know what I mean?

01:24:31.859 --> 01:24:33.884
I wouldn't wanna keep him waiting.

01:24:36.864 --> 01:24:38.682
Whoa, whoa.

01:24:38.782 --> 01:24:41.268
Okay, okay. I know
a lot of you people

01:24:41.368 --> 01:24:43.145
probably like to wait
till the last minute.

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:46.023
Well, this is it!
This is the last minute!

01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:47.858
What are you doing here?

01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:50.235
You're disturbing the peace. Come on.

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:52.738
Out of the way.
Why aren't you home in bed?

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:55.074
Get out of here.

01:24:55.174 --> 01:24:56.951
Stand back. Out of my way.

01:24:57.051 --> 01:25:00.955
Look out.

01:25:01.055 --> 01:25:04.166
Aw!

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:07.209
This party is over, Mr. Newman.

01:25:10.731 --> 01:25:13.132
You can say that again.

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:24.186
Okay, Fletcher...

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:26.021
you win. Give me the money.

01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:27.314
Settle down.

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:29.775
All in good time, Mr. Bilchik.

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:32.653
What, are you crazy?
Give me the money!

01:25:32.753 --> 01:25:35.239
Please, if you don't mind,

01:25:35.339 --> 01:25:38.909
there are a few things I'd
like to say to these people

01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:42.536
before this transaction takes place.

01:25:45.472 --> 01:25:46.582
What?

01:25:55.109 --> 01:25:58.053
Dear friends,

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:02.099
I'm sure that one day you'll realize

01:26:02.199 --> 01:26:03.976
that by shutting down

01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:06.645
this hotbed of subversive activity...

01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:08.814
Hey, mister!

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:10.315
Not now, okay?

01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:12.484
I was just wondering if it's too late

01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:14.194
to buy any of them shares.

01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:17.281
I'll take whatever you got left.

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:21.326
- How much is that?
- $2,000.

01:26:22.626 --> 01:26:24.611
Keep the change.

01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:31.462
I have decided not to tear
down the building after all.

01:26:31.562 --> 01:26:34.798
I am going to turn
it into a laundromat.

01:26:34.898 --> 01:26:37.801
Mr. Big Louie, sir?

01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:40.846
My uncle Harvey wanted
you to have this.

01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:44.559
$75,000. It's all there.

01:26:45.159 --> 01:26:46.769
Now let me tell you something...

01:26:46.869 --> 01:26:49.230
Uncle Harvey.

01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:51.940
Hey, what's going on here?

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:56.612
Now, wait just one minute!
What do think you're doing?

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:58.280
We did it! The station's ours!

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:27.726
- Wow, look at that!
- You can't do this!

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:31.021
We had an agreement, remember?
An oral contract.

01:27:31.121 --> 01:27:32.356
I'll sue.

01:27:32.456 --> 01:27:34.982
Oh, blow it out your ear, scuzbag.

01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:37.945
R.J. Fletcher?

01:27:38.045 --> 01:27:40.781
- So what if I am?
- I'm John Vickers, F.C.C.

01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:42.699
I've noticed your
that station is late

01:27:42.799 --> 01:27:45.202
in filing its license
renewal this year.

01:27:45.302 --> 01:27:47.204
Now, normally, this kind of violation

01:27:47.304 --> 01:27:48.956
is punishable by a stiff fine,

01:27:49.056 --> 01:27:50.624
but I've been watching you lately.

01:27:50.724 --> 01:27:52.793
You made a big impression on me.

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:55.212
Yeah, I'm revoking your license.

01:27:55.312 --> 01:27:57.713
Effective immediately,
you're off the air.

01:27:58.565 --> 01:28:00.759
Hi, Pamela Finklestein here

01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:03.053
coming to you with the most
incredible turn of events.

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:06.348
Not only has the once-powerful
corporate broadcasting giant

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:08.600
been thoroughly crushed and defeated,

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.144
but now, as luck would have it,

01:28:10.244 --> 01:28:13.814
they've been completely stripped
of their license by the F.C.C.!

01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:18.567
What do you have to say about it,
you worthless, slobbering pig?

01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:21.738
Dad? Where's my dad?

01:28:21.838 --> 01:28:24.198
What's going on here? Whoa!

01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:30.664
Oh, did I do that?

01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:32.791
Oopsie!

01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:37.004
Dad!

01:28:37.104 --> 01:28:38.172
Philo!

01:28:38.272 --> 01:28:41.175
Hey, you really went beyond the call
of duty on this one, pal. Thanks.

01:28:41.275 --> 01:28:43.260
I'm glad to have been
of service, George.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:47.764
Well, i-i-it appears my work
on this planet is complete.

01:28:47.864 --> 01:28:49.600
I must now return to my home

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:52.144
on the planet Zarkon.

01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:55.187
Okay. Well, have fun.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.361
Hey, nice going, kid.

01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:03.655
I didn't know you had it in you.

01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:06.283
- You're okay.
- Thanks, Uncle Harvey.

01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:09.786
- Have a nice flight back to the coast.
- Thanks.

01:29:09.886 --> 01:29:12.830
- Say hi to Aunt Esther for me.
- Sure will.

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:17.294
Excuse me.

01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:19.296
Aren't you R.J. Fletcher?

01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:23.006
Yes! Ooh!

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:26.178
Yeah!

01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:29.223
Hey, Stanley, congratulations.
You really pulled us through.

01:29:29.323 --> 01:29:32.100
George, I want you to know that I'm
mighty proud to be a part of your team.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.602
Well, I'm mighty proud
of you, too, Stanley.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:37.271
In fact, I'd like to present you
with a small token of my gratitude.

01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:41.151
A trophy.

01:29:41.251 --> 01:29:43.403
That... that's me?

01:29:43.503 --> 01:29:46.698
"Stanley... World's greatest janitor

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:49.493
and TV Star."

01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:52.329
Aw, George,

01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:54.915
I never had anybody give
me a trophy before.

01:29:55.015 --> 01:29:57.960
It's... it's big.

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:02.130
George, you're my best
friend in the whole world.

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.091
I'm gonna go show
everybody right now.

01:30:04.191 --> 01:30:05.592
Hey, everybody,

01:30:05.692 --> 01:30:07.511
look at what George gave me!

01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:11.181
Hey! Hey, I know you.

01:30:11.281 --> 01:30:13.475
You're the guy that gave me

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:17.604
that 1955 double-die
Denver mint penny.

01:30:17.704 --> 01:30:20.774
Oh, ho, ho, thanks a lot, mister.

01:30:20.874 --> 01:30:24.319
That thing was worth a fortune.

01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:26.238
When I cashed it in,

01:30:26.338 --> 01:30:29.658
I got enough money to buy
a whole bunch of shares,

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:33.662
plus I got me a real neat watch.

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:36.872
It's a Rolex. See?

01:30:46.983 --> 01:30:49.386
George?

01:30:51.446 --> 01:30:54.391
You know those dreams
you're always having?

01:30:54.491 --> 01:30:56.018
Yeah?

01:30:56.118 --> 01:30:59.896
Well, do you think
that maybe sometime

01:30:59.996 --> 01:31:02.439
I could be part of them?

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:06.528
Honey, from now on,

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:08.864
you're gonna be in all of 'em.

01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:12.409
Oh, George.

01:31:12.509 --> 01:31:15.871
Darlin', let's leave
this place right now.

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:17.748
Let's go this very minute.

01:31:17.848 --> 01:31:20.959
No, dear, please.
Let's wait till tomorrow.

01:31:21.059 --> 01:31:24.212
But why? Why?

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:27.966
Because tomorrow is another day.

01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:31.593
I knew she was going to say that.

01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:09.174
<i>Put down your remote control</i>

01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:11.842
<i>Throw out your "TV Guide"</i>

01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:16.014
<i>Put away your jacket</i>

01:32:16.114 --> 01:32:19.182
<i>There's no need to go outside</i>

01:32:20.243 --> 01:32:25.524
<i>Don't you know that we
control the horizontal?</i>

01:32:25.624 --> 01:32:29.319
<i>We control the vertical, too</i>

01:32:29.419 --> 01:32:34.241
<i>We gonna make a couch
potato out of you</i>

01:32:34.341 --> 01:32:37.119
<i>That's what we're going to do now</i>

01:32:37.219 --> 01:32:39.162
<i>Don't change the channel</i>

01:32:39.262 --> 01:32:40.997

01:32:41.097 --> 01:32:44.668

01:32:44.768 --> 01:32:46.670

01:32:55.612 --> 01:32:58.640
<i>Just crank up the volume
and yank off the knob</i>

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:00.559

01:33:10.418 --> 01:33:12.112
<i>Disconnect the phone</i>

01:33:12.212 --> 01:33:15.322
<i>Now, leave the dishes in the sink</i>

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:19.619
<i>You better put away your homework</i>

01:33:19.719 --> 01:33:22.913
<i>Prime time ain't no time to think</i>

01:33:23.848 --> 01:33:29.045
<i>All you do is make
yourself a TV dinner</i>

01:33:29.145 --> 01:33:33.300
<i>Press your face right
up against the screen</i>

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:37.929
<i>We gonna show you things
you ain't ever seen</i>

01:33:38.029 --> 01:33:40.765

01:33:40.865 --> 01:33:42.601

anytime that you please</i>

01:34:47.641 --> 01:34:51.169

stare at the picture tube</i>

into cottage cheese</i>

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:55.715
