LOOK, I CAN DO IT THIS TIME.

00:06.881 --> 00:08.258
I CAN LOOK HAPPY.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.093

HELEN MIRREN.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.101
- [bleep].

00:20.979 --> 00:22.981
- HONEY, YOU CAN'T SAY THAT
ON TV.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.607
- OH, I KNOW.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.610
WHY AM I INCAPABLE
OF FAKING HAPPINESS

00:27.694 --> 00:29.612
FOR OTHER PEOPLE?

00:29.696 --> 00:32.615
MELANIE, HOW DO YOU DO IT?

00:32.698 --> 00:33.783
- I'M NOT FAKING IT.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.910
I AM GENUINELY HAPPY
WHEN OTHERS DO WELL.

00:35.994 --> 00:39.372
- BUT...WHY?

00:39.456 --> 00:42.167
WELL, AT LEAST
WITH ELKA SITTING NEXT TO ME,

00:42.250 --> 00:44.085
SOMEONE WILL SMILE CONVINCINGLY
IF I LOSE.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.128
- AGAIN,

00:45.211 --> 00:47.422
ELKA IS STAYING
IN CLEVELAND.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.174
HER CITY COUNCIL ELECTION'S

00:49.257 --> 00:50.467
AS THE OSCARS.

00:50.550 --> 00:51.968

00:52.051 --> 00:53.344
MELANIE LOST THE COIN TOSS.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.555
- AND I AM GENUINELY HAPPY
FOR YOU, JOY.

00:55.638 --> 00:58.933
- WOW.
THAT WAS SO GRACIOUS.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.435
YOU KNOW, I CAN DO THAT.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.061
NO, NO, NO.
JOY, ANNOUNCE THE WINNER AGAIN.

- OKAY.

01:03.354 --> 01:06.024
AND THE ACADEMY AWARD
GOES TO...

01:06.107 --> 01:07.317
HELEN MIRREN.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.652
- [bleep].

01:09.736 --> 01:11.237
WAS THAT BETTER?

01:13.072 --> 01:15.950
- OH, LOOK!

01:16.034 --> 01:19.329
GEORGE CLOONEY LOOKS SO CUTE.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.039
- HOW DID IT GO
AT THE LATINO FESTIVAL?

01:21.122 --> 01:22.290
- OH, GREAT.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.042
THEY'RE ALL GONNA VOTE
FOR ME.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.211
- BECAUSE YOU LIED TO THEM,

01:26.294 --> 01:27.921
LIKE YOU LIE TO EVERYONE.

01:28.004 --> 01:30.799
SHE PROMISED THEM
SHE'D MAKE SPANISH

01:30.882 --> 01:35.011
THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE
OF CLEVELAND.

01:35.094 --> 01:39.516
- CAMPAIGN PROMISES--
THEY'RE LIKE JOY'S DATES.

01:39.599 --> 01:43.812
THEY DO THE DEED,
AND THEN THEY DISAPPEAR.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.146
- OOH, HEY,
WHILE YOU WERE OUT,

01:45.230 --> 01:47.023
DID YOU SEE THE BILLBOARDS
FOR MY RADIO SHOW?

01:47.106 --> 01:48.983
- YES, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE
OF YOU.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.527
- THANK YOU.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.320
IT'S ALL PART OF
THIS NEW MARKETING CAMPAIGN.

01:52.403 --> 01:55.031
AND THE STATION MANAGER--
WELL, HE LET ME BRING THIS HOME.

01:55.114 --> 01:57.784
- OH, WOW.
- GORGEOUS.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.537
- THEY MAY HAVE PHOTOSHOPPED IT
JUST A ITTY-BITTY-BITTY BIT.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.205
- JUST LIKE YOU.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.540
- IT'S WONDERFUL
YOU DON'T CARE

02:03.623 --> 02:04.958
WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT IT

02:05.041 --> 02:07.418
ON PHOTOSHOPFLOP.COM.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.049
- WHAT?
WHAT'S PHOTOSHOPFLOP.COM?

02:13.132 --> 02:15.718
- IT'S A WEBSITE WITH PICTURES
OF FAMOUS PEOPLE

02:15.802 --> 02:19.722
BEFORE AND AFTER THEY'VE
"ALLEGEDLY" BEEN ALTERED.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.391
- OH, MY GOD.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.393
THEY TOOK
THIS TOTALLY UNFLATTERING

02:23.476 --> 02:24.519
"BEFORE" PICTURE OF ME

02:24.602 --> 02:28.356

TO WHAT I REALLY LOOK LIKE.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.776
OKAY, MAYBE I HAVE GAINED
A FEW POUNDS

02:31.860 --> 02:32.902
SINCE I BROKE MY FOOT

02:32.986 --> 02:34.237
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO EXERCISE,

02:34.320 --> 02:35.905
BUT THIS IS JUST MEAN.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.241
- I PROMISE,
IF I'M ELECTED,

02:38.324 --> 02:39.701
I WILL SEE THAT ANYONE

02:39.784 --> 02:43.913
WHO MAKES FUN OF YOU
IS KILLED.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.749
- I APPRECIATE THAT, ELKA,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.251
MAYBE THIS IS JUST
MY WAKE-UP CALL.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.628
I AM NOT GONNA LEAVE THIS HOUSE
UNTIL I LOOK LIKE HER.

02:50.712 --> 02:51.880
[doorbell rings]

02:51.963 --> 02:52.881
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS NOT EAT

02:52.964 --> 02:54.424
AND AVOID
ANY EMOTIONAL TRIGGERS

02:54.507 --> 02:55.592
THAT ARE GONNA MAKE ME
WANT TO EAT.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.926
[chuckles]

02:57.010 --> 02:58.761
- HI, BABY.
- OH, MY GOD.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.099
IT'S MY MOM.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.518
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
I JUST GAINED 5 POUNDS.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.116
OF PEOPLE CALLING YOU FAT--

03:20.199 --> 03:21.784
- WELL, THEY DIDN'T
ACTUALLY SAY "FAT."

03:21.868 --> 03:23.745

BECAUSE I DID.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.665

SOMEONE LEAKED THE GOWN
CHARLIZE THERON IS WEARING.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.025
I'M WEARING THE SAME DRESS
AS CHARLIZE THERON?

04:36.109 --> 04:37.402

04:37.485 --> 04:40.238
IT'LL LOOK A LOT DIFFERENT
ON HER.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.031

04:42.115 --> 04:43.741
I'M GOING TO BE
THE LOWEST SCORE EVER

04:43.825 --> 04:46.661
ON "WHO WORE IT BETTER?"

04:46.744 --> 04:48.871
I WISH I COULD JUST KNOW
IF I WON.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.873
OTHERWISE,
I--I'D RATHER STAY IN BED.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.333
- OH, LIKE JOAN CRAWFORD.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.584
SHE SKIPPED THE AWARDS
ONE YEAR

04:53.668 --> 04:55.169
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT
SHE WOULD LOSE.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.505
- RIGHT.
I SAW THAT IN <i> MOMMIE DEAREST.</i>

04:57.588 --> 04:59.507
THE NETWORKS PUT CAMERAS
BY HER FAKE SICKBED,

04:59.590 --> 05:01.551
YOU KNOW, TO FILM HER
IN CASE SHE WON.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.720
BUT ACTRESSES WERE CRAZY
BACK THEN.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.347
- I'LL DO IT.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.724
OH, THANK YOU,
JOAN CRAWFORD,

05:07.807 --> 05:10.935
FOR YOUR INSPIRING EXAMPLE.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.146
- YOU DON'T HEAR THAT
VERY OFTEN.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.731
- THEN IT'S SETTLED.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.899
THE ACADEMY
WILL HAVE TO COME TO ME.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.735
WE ARE ALL GOING TO STAY
IN CLEVELAND.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.528
NO ONE IS GOING
TO THE OSCARS.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.572
- HERE IT IS.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.824
IT COST A FORTUNE.

05:24.907 --> 05:27.243
BUT I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED
OF GOING TO THE ACADEMY AWARDS

05:27.326 --> 05:28.745
EVER SINCE
I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

05:28.828 --> 05:31.622
AND NOW THAT DREAM
IS COMING TRUE.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.378
- HERE, JOY,
HAVE A COOKIE.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.302
- EXCUSE ME, SIR.

05:44.385 --> 05:48.931
DID YOU DROP THIS $20 BILL?

05:49.015 --> 05:50.141
- "VOTE OSTROVSKY"?

05:50.224 --> 05:53.561
- SOUNDS LIKE GOOD ADVICE.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.941
- ELKA, BAD NEWS.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.985
PEOPLE ARE SAYING
COUNCILMAN POWELL

06:01.069 --> 06:03.237
IS BUYING VOTES
FOR $10 APIECE.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.240
- I'M APPALLED.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.284
I'VE BEEN PAYING 20.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.495
- IT GETS WORSE.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.830
HE'S HOLDING A BIG
"GET OUT THE VOTE" RALLY TONIGHT

06:12.914 --> 06:14.290
IN PORT LEE.

06:14.373 --> 06:15.750
- THERE'S ONLY ONE BRIDGE

06:15.833 --> 06:17.627
BETWEEN HERE AND PORT LEE,
RIGHT?

06:17.710 --> 06:19.087
- YES.

06:19.170 --> 06:22.423
- SOUNDS LIKE IT'S TIME
FOR SOME TRAFFIC PROBLEMS

06:22.507 --> 06:24.634
ON THE BRIDGE
TO PORT LEE.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.309
- THIS WAS A GREAT IDEA,
VICTORIA.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.686
- WITH ELECTIONS TODAY
AND THE OSCARS TONIGHT,

06:35.770 --> 06:37.772
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD ALL
FREE OUR MINDS

06:37.855 --> 06:39.816
AND MEDITATE ON WHAT'S
REALLY IMPORTANT.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.275
- WINNING.

06:41.359 --> 06:44.320
- WINNING GLORIOUSLY.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.322
- I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT TONIGHT.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.950
- ELKA DID A TERRIBLE THING.

06:49.033 --> 06:52.203
SHE CAUSED A TRAFFIC JAM
ON THE BRIDGE TO PORT LEE.

06:54.038 --> 06:55.498
- HOW DID SHE DO THAT?

06:55.581 --> 06:58.876
- SHE SENT A MASS EMAIL
TO THOUSANDS OF SENIORS

06:58.960 --> 07:01.045
SAYING THAT'S WHERE THEY COULD
MEET THEIR FAVORITE STARS

07:01.129 --> 07:03.631
FROM THE WEATHER CHANNEL.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.008
- I ALSO TOLD THEM
THE BRIDGE TOLL

07:06.092 --> 07:08.678
WOULD BE HALF PRICE
IF THEY PAID IN PENNIES.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.977
- YOU KNOW,
THIS MASK SMELLS DELICIOUS.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.856
HMM, AVOCADO AND HONEY.

07:19.939 --> 07:24.026
- AND THERE'S NO CALORIES
IF IT'S ON YOUR FACE.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.862
- WHY IS IT
WHENEVER I'M ON A DIET,

07:25.945 --> 07:27.405
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS FOOD?

07:27.488 --> 07:29.031
IT'S ALMOST LUSTFUL.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.201
- I SAW A STUDY THAT SAID
THAT 52% OF WOMEN

07:32.285 --> 07:34.871
WOULD CHOOSE CHOCOLATE
OVER SEX.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.706
- I SURE NEVER TOLD
A BAR OF CHOCOLATE

07:36.789 --> 07:38.249
I WAS TOO SLEEPY.

07:38.332 --> 07:42.378
[laughter]

07:42.461 --> 07:44.547
- YOU KNOW,
MEN SAY THEY LOVE CURVES,

07:44.630 --> 07:48.134
BUT WHAT THEY'RE REALLY SAYING
IS, THEY LOVE BOOBS.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.887
IF SOFIA VERGARA'S BREAST FAT
WAS IN HER BELLY,

07:50.970 --> 07:53.556
THEY WOULDN'T LOVE HER CURVES
SO MUCH.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.724
- THOSE THINGS ARE GONNA SAG.

07:54.807 --> 07:55.975
- BIG-TIME.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.394
- ANY DAY NOW.

07:58.477 --> 08:00.354
- AND WHY DO WE DO THAT?

08:00.438 --> 08:02.899
JUDGE EACH OTHER SO HARSHLY,

08:02.982 --> 08:05.735
GRAB MAGAZINES WITH PICTURES
OF CELEBRITY CELLULITE.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.320
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE WOMEN--

08:07.403 --> 08:10.573
WE NEED TO CREATE
A JUDGMENT-FREE ZONE.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.743
- I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR YOU
SAY THAT, MELANIE,

08:13.826 --> 08:16.746
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO SHARE MY STORY.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.248
GROWING UP,
I WAS SO SKINNY.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.043
I'D EAT AND EAT
ANYTHING I WANTED

08:22.126 --> 08:24.253
AND NEVER PUT ON AN OUNCE.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.714
TO THIS DAY, I HAVE TROUBLE
KEEPING ON WEIGHT.

08:26.797 --> 08:31.928
CHEESE, FRENCH FRIES,
CHOCOLATE, WINE--

08:32.010 --> 08:34.722
THEY ALL FALL RIGHT OFF.

08:34.804 --> 08:36.474
OH, IT'S SO NICE
TO SAY THESE THINGS

08:36.557 --> 08:38.643
AND NOT BE JUDGED.

08:45.524 --> 08:48.236
- YOU KNOW, MELANIE,
WE'VE BEEN GOOD SO FAR,

08:48.319 --> 08:49.612
AND WE GOT
THE ANKLE WEIGHTS ON,

08:49.695 --> 08:51.989
SO EVEN BREATHING'S
AN EXERCISE.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.616
WE DESERVE A TREAT.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.618
HOW ABOUT SOME FROZEN YOGURT,
SPRINKLES,

08:55.701 --> 08:57.119
AND MAYBE SOME
GUMMY BEARS?

08:57.203 --> 08:58.496
- NO, MOM.
WE'RE ON A DIET.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.830
- COME ON.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.500
GUMMY BEARS--
THEY'RE PRACTICALLY FRUIT.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.961
- I AM NOT GONNA REWARD MYSELF
WITH FOOD.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.921
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THAT
SINCE I WAS A KID.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.130
- OH, SO IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.298
IT'S ALWAYS
THE MOTHER'S FAULT.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.633
- NO,
IT'S NOT ALL YOUR FAULT.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.635
I'M JUST SAYING
YOU'RE NOT HELPING ME.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.636
- WELL,
IF I'M NOT HELPING YOU,

09:13.719 --> 09:15.471
MAYBE I SHOULD GET OUT
OF HERE.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.306
- MOM, DON'T RUN AWAY
FROM ME.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.516
- TOO LATE.
I'M OUT OF HERE.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.393
- YEAH, WELL,
NOT IF I CATCH YOU.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.815
- CAN YOU BELIEVE
SHE ATE HER FACE MASK?

09:25.898 --> 09:26.816
- STILL IN THE ROOM.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.660
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S OSCAR NIGHT.

09:37.743 --> 09:41.163
JOY, I'M SORRY
YOU COULDN'T WEAR YOUR GOWN.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.374
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,
THE WHITE OF YOUR UNIFORM

09:43.457 --> 09:46.419
IS BOUNCING LIGHT
INTO MY HAIR.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.629
- THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.506
- OH, IT'S ALL SET.

09:50.589 --> 09:53.009
I HAVE MY LOVELY NURSE
BY MY SIDE.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.803
AND GEORGE CLOONEY
WILL BE SITTING RIGHT HERE

09:55.886 --> 09:58.347
IN HIS ADORABLE
DOGGY TUX,

09:58.431 --> 10:03.102
STAYING PUT BECAUSE I PUT
A LITTLE BACON GREASE ON MY LEG.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.062
COULD YOU OPEN THAT WINDOW
JUST A SKOSH

10:05.146 --> 10:06.731
SO THE CANDLES FLICKER,

10:06.814 --> 10:09.108
MAKING MY EYES DANCE?

10:09.191 --> 10:11.152
[buzzing]

10:11.235 --> 10:13.863
NOW, IF I WIN--
AND WE ALL KNOW I SHOULD--

10:13.946 --> 10:16.490
A RED LIGHT WILL APPEAR
ON THAT CAMERA,

10:16.574 --> 10:19.076
WHICH WILL BE A DIRECT FEED
TO THE NETWORK BROADCAST.

10:19.160 --> 10:23.205
I GAZE AT MY ADORING FANS
AND DESPISING PEERS,

10:23.289 --> 10:25.499
MAKE A QUICK GASP OF SURPRISE,
LIKE THIS...

10:25.583 --> 10:27.835
[gasps]

10:27.918 --> 10:30.713
BEE!

10:32.131 --> 10:34.175
- HOW'D IT GO WITH YOUR MOM?
- OH, TERRIBLE.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.885
SHE'S ON HER WAY
TO THE AIRPORT NOW.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.054
YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO HAVE
A REASONABLE CONVERSATION

10:38.137 --> 10:40.431
WHERE I CALMLY EXPLAINED TO HER
THAT SHE WAS THE CAUSE

10:40.514 --> 10:43.934
OF ALL MY PROBLEMS,
AND SOMEHOW SHE TOOK OFFENSE.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.227
[sighs]

10:45.311 --> 10:46.562
ANY ELECTION NEWS?

10:46.645 --> 10:47.897
- IT'S NECK AND NECK.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.440
- THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT PORT LEE.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.067
TURN IT UP.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.693
- NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN WHY,

10:52.777 --> 10:54.737
BUT TRAFFIC IS MOVING
VERY, VERY SLOWLY

10:54.820 --> 10:57.907
ON THE BRIDGE TO PORT LEE.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.410
- THEY CAN'T PIN IT ON ME.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.913
[phone rings]

11:03.996 --> 11:06.374
- MAMIE SUE JOHNSON.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.709
UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.172
IT'S THE <i> PLAIN DEALER.</i>
THEY'RE PINNING IT ON YOU.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.512
THEY HAVE A COPY
OF THE PORT LEE EMAIL.

11:19.595 --> 11:22.598
- TELL THEM I HAVE
NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS.

11:22.681 --> 11:25.184
- ELKA OSTROVSKY
HAD NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.353
- SHE'S GONNA FIRE
THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.730
- SHE'S GOING TO FIRE
THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.107
- MAMIE SUE JOHNSON.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.817
- MAMIE SUE JOHNSON.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.572
THAT'S ME.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.616
YOU CHRIS CHRISTIE'D ME!

11:45.037 --> 11:47.998
- IT'S JUST POLITICS.

11:48.082 --> 11:51.252
- YOU KNOW, IF I AM FIRED,
I SHOULD GO.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.295
NO NEED TO DRIVE ME HOME.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.673
I'LL TAKE THE BUS
YOU THREW ME UNDER.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.594
- MOST OF THE SWELLING
IS ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR MOUTH.

12:00.678 --> 12:06.517
THE REST I MADE LOOK LIKE
A CINDY CRAWFORD BEAUTY MOLE.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.811
- WELL, WITH LIGHTING,
YOU CAN HIDE ANYTHING.

12:08.894 --> 12:12.773
RUMOR HAS IT,
EVA MENDES HAS A HUNCHBACK.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.151
- YOU STARTED THAT RUMOR.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.154
- AND IT NEVER CAUGHT ON
THE WAY I'D HOPED.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.989
WELL, WE JUST NEED TO MOVE
ALL THE CANDLES

12:20.072 --> 12:21.782
TO THE GOOD SIDE
OF MY FACE.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.200
- CAREFUL.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.618
THERE'S A LOT OF CHEMICALS
IN THE AIR

12:24.702 --> 12:26.579
FROM YOUR HAIR SPRAY,
AND IT COULD CATCH ON--

12:26.662 --> 12:28.247
[gasps]

12:29.748 --> 12:31.167
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.668
I SHOULDN'T DRINK
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.546
BUT MY MOM'S NOT HERE,
SO I CAN DO WHAT I WANT.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.673
- IF YOU'RE DONE TALKING
TO YOUR WINE GLASS,

12:37.756 --> 12:40.718
I'M TRYING TO HEAR THE TV.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.012
- OH, LOOK, I THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY WHO WON.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.347
- WITH 80% OF THE VOTES COUNTED,
WE ARE CALLING

12:45.431 --> 12:48.350
THE HOTLY CONTESTED
TENTH COUNCIL DISTRICT RACE

12:48.434 --> 12:50.352
FOR ELKA OSTROVSKY.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.729
- YOU WON!

12:51.812 --> 12:53.606
- I WON?

12:53.689 --> 12:57.818
[cheering]

12:57.902 --> 12:59.403
- WHAT'S ALL THE SCREAMING
ABOUT DOWN HERE?

12:59.487 --> 13:00.779
- ELKA WON.

13:00.863 --> 13:01.780
- OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.365
- HEY, WHAT'S ALL THE SCREAMING
ABOUT UP THERE?

13:03.449 --> 13:04.825
- OH, VICTORIA GOT STUNG
BY A BEE,

13:04.909 --> 13:05.993
AND HER HAIR CAUGHT ON FIRE,

13:06.076 --> 13:08.329
BUT IT'S ALL GOING
TO BE FINE.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.331
- WE'RE TOLD THAT
EX-COUNCILMAN POWELL

13:10.414 --> 13:13.751
WILL BE CALLING OSTROVSKY SOON
TO GRACIOUSLY CONCEDE.

13:13.834 --> 13:18.214
[phone rings]

13:18.297 --> 13:20.716
- HEY, POWELL.

13:20.799 --> 13:23.719
NO, YOU GO TO HELL.

13:23.802 --> 13:27.223
NO,
YOU GO TO HELL.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.892
NO, YOU GO TO HELL!

13:29.975 --> 13:32.770
- THE TURBAN TOTALLY WORKS.

13:35.356 --> 13:39.360
IT SELLS YOUR ILLNESS WITH
CLASSIC OLD HOLLYWOOD GLAMOUR.

13:39.443 --> 13:42.279
- SO I MIGHT START A TREND?

13:42.363 --> 13:45.908
- SURE.
WHY NOT?

13:45.991 --> 13:47.618
- WELL, WE HAVE AN HOUR
TO RELAX.

13:47.701 --> 13:48.953
CHECK OUT THE LIVE FEED.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.454
LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
AT THE OSCARS.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.082
- THE ACADEMY AWARDS
WILL BE RIGHT BACK

13:53.165 --> 13:55.376
WITH THE AWARDS FOR
BEST SOUND EDITING...

13:55.459 --> 13:57.378
- TOTAL SNOOZE FEST.
WE GOT TIME.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.630
- AND BEST ACTRESS
IN A SUPPORTING ROLE.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.048
- WHAT?
ALREADY?

14:01.131 --> 14:02.591
- OH, MY GOD.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.552
YOU TOLD US YOUR CATEGORY
WASN'T UP FOR ANOTHER HOUR.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.095
- NO, WELL,
THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.429
THEY SAID IT WOULD BE ON
AT 5:30.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.306
AND SINCE THERE'S
A FOUR-HOUR TIME DIFFERENCE

14:09.390 --> 14:11.433
BETWEEN ACTUAL TIME
AND OHIO TIME--

14:11.517 --> 14:13.811
- IT'S A THREE-HOUR DIFFERENCE,
YOU COTTON-HEADED ACTRESS.

14:13.894 --> 14:16.647
- OH, GOD!
I COULD BE ON CAMERA ANY SECOND.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.607
I'M NERVOUS.
I NEED WINE.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.402
- NO. I COULD BE ON CAMERA TOO.
I NEED WINE.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.237
[gasps]

14:27.866 --> 14:29.034
- WHAT THE HELL
AM I GONNA DO?

14:29.118 --> 14:30.578
THEY'RE ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE
MY CATEGORY.

14:30.661 --> 14:31.996
- DON'T PANIC.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.622
WE'LL JUST TURN YOUR JACKET
AROUND.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.291
REMEMBER WHEN CELINE DION

14:35.374 --> 14:37.334
WORE THAT BACKWARDS TUX
TO THE OSCARS?

14:37.418 --> 14:39.962
- SHE LOOKED LIKE
A MENTALLY CHALLENGED CATERER.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.798
- YES, BUT A GORGEOUS,
SEXY, YOUNG

14:42.881 --> 14:45.801
MENTALLY CHALLENGED CATERER.

14:45.884 --> 14:48.637
- I'M LISTENING.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.348
- I SHARE THIS AWARD
WITH MY ASSISTANT SOUND EDITOR

14:51.432 --> 14:54.310
AND BEST FRIEND,
CHELSEA MYERS.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.978
I COULDN'T HAVE WON
WITHOUT YOU.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.606
- I COULDN'T HAVE WON
WITHOUT MAMIE SUE.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.150
- AND WINNING WOULDN'T BE FUN
WITHOUT YOU.

15:01.233 --> 15:05.654
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
BORING SOUND GUY.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.657
- MOST OF ALL,
I WANT TO THANK MY MOTHER.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.244
MOM, I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO
HAVE YOU HERE WITH ME TONIGHT.

15:12.328 --> 15:16.332
THIS IS FOR YOU.
HUG YOUR MOMS, EVERYONE.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.292
[applause]

15:18.375 --> 15:20.502
- NOW BORING SOUND GUY
IS RIGHT ABOUT ME.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.881
BUT I CAN'T HUG MY MOM
BECAUSE I CHASED HER AWAY.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.341
AND YOU KNOW WHO I BLAME?

15:25.424 --> 15:26.342
- YOURSELF?

15:26.425 --> 15:27.343
- NO.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.969
HER.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.346
AND THIS--
THIS UNREALISTIC IDEA

15:30.429 --> 15:32.181
OF WHAT WOMEN
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.183
I BLAME HER
AND--AND HOLLYWOOD

15:34.266 --> 15:35.392
AND--AND SOCIETY!

15:35.476 --> 15:36.977
EVERYONE BUT ME!

15:42.650 --> 15:44.526
- YOU SHOULD EAT SOMETHING.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.032
- IVY JOHNSON FOR
<i>NIGHT OF THE HEREAFTER.</i>

15:50.115 --> 15:51.492
- HURRY UP.

15:51.575 --> 15:53.577
CAN YOU STILL SEE
THE WINE STAINS ON MY SLEEVES?

15:53.661 --> 15:55.371
- NO. IT'S OKAY.
I'LL JUST TIE THEM BEHIND YOU.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.748
- AND VICTORIA CHASE
FOR <i> CLEVELAND RHAPSODY.</i>

15:57.831 --> 15:59.750
- OH, GOD. THAT'S ME.
HURRY.

15:59.833 --> 16:03.212
- IT'S DONE.
YOU'RE GOOD.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.214
- I CAN'T MOVE MY ARMS.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.216
DO I LOOK LIKE
I'M WEARING A STRAITJACKET?

16:07.299 --> 16:09.510
- NO.
YOU'RE STUNNING.

16:09.593 --> 16:12.096
- AND THE OSCAR GOES TO
HELEN MIRREN.

16:12.179 --> 16:15.766
- [bleep]!

16:15.849 --> 16:17.559
- AND VICTORIA CHASE.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.727
- WHAT?

16:18.811 --> 16:19.895
- IT'S A TIE!

16:19.978 --> 16:22.564
[both scream]

16:22.648 --> 16:23.732
- YOU WON!

16:23.816 --> 16:25.401
THE RED LIGHT'S ON!

16:25.484 --> 16:27.986
WE'VE BEEN ON TV
THE WHOLE TIME.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.950
[no audio]

16:35.703 --> 16:39.081
- OH, MY GOD.

16:39.164 --> 16:44.628
- DID JOY GET STUNG
BY A BEE TOO?

16:44.712 --> 16:46.130
- THAT'S HER BREAST.

16:46.213 --> 16:50.300
AND LOOK AT THAT AUDIENCE--
JUDGING THEM.

16:50.384 --> 16:53.345
WELL, I'M JUDGING ALL OF YOU
SKINNY BITCHES!

16:53.429 --> 16:57.057
AND I FIND YOU GUILTY!

16:57.141 --> 16:59.643
- OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.438
THANK YOU, ACADEMY.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.148
STOP IT.
STOP IT, GEORGE CLOONEY.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.483
I'M SORRY.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.902
GEORGE CLOONEY
IS HUMPING MY LEG.

17:08.986 --> 17:13.449
'CAUSE YOU SEE, HE'S ATTRACTED
TO MY BACON SMELL.

17:13.531 --> 17:14.825
BECAUSE HE'S A DOG.

17:14.907 --> 17:16.452
GEORGE CLOONEY IS A DOG.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.454
I'M NOT CRAZY!

17:18.537 --> 17:21.457
NURSE,
SHOW AMERICA GEORGE CLOONEY.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.752
UH, YES, I WISH I COULD BE THERE
WITH ALL OF YOU,

17:25.836 --> 17:28.338
BUT I DONATED MY LIVER.

17:28.422 --> 17:32.134
- KIDNEY.
- KIDNEY, RIGHT.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.969
AND WHILE I KNOW
I LOOK HORRIBLE--

17:34.052 --> 17:36.805
- NO, YOU DO NOT
LOOK HORRIBLE.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.309
Y-YOU PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD,
YOU'RE THE HORRIBLE ONES.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.769
- MELANIE, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

17:41.852 --> 17:43.604
- I'M TAKING A STAND.

17:43.687 --> 17:46.899
SHAME ON YOU, HOLLYWOOD
AND ALL YOU SIZE ZERO DRESSES.

17:46.982 --> 17:50.152
THIS IS WHAT NORMAL
LOOKS LIKE.

17:50.235 --> 17:54.114
AND, MOM, I'M SORRY.
I-I LOVE YOU.

17:54.198 --> 17:57.326
- I'M SORRY, MAMIE SUE.
I'M SO SORRY.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.869
I SHOULDN'T HAVE THROWN YOU
UNDER THE BUS.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.329
- MUSIC!

18:00.412 --> 18:02.706
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
PLEASE, PLAY ME OFF!

18:02.790 --> 18:05.667
[orchestral fanfare]

18:09.463 --> 18:11.507
- OH, THANK YOU, SUSAN LUCCI.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.509
IT WAS SO NICE OF YOU
TO CALL ME

18:13.592 --> 18:17.638
AND CONGRATULATE ME
ON WINNING AN OSCAR.

18:17.721 --> 18:20.724
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I CALLED YOU.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.352
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WON AN OSCAR.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.813
- WHAT AN AMAZING NIGHT.

18:25.896 --> 18:29.691
TO VICTORIA AND ELKA.

18:29.775 --> 18:33.111
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE WAS THAT
A BILLION PEOPLE SAW MY BOOB.

18:34.488 --> 18:37.533
- OH, STOP COMPLAINING, JOY.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.451
YOU'RE MAKING A MOUNTAIN
OUT OF A MOLEHILL.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.915
- I THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING
WAS WONDERFUL,

18:44.998 --> 18:48.377
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CAME ON
AND TALKED ABOUT ME.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.546
BUT YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE, ELKA.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.089
- OH, YES, I DID, MAMIE SUE.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.049
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

18:54.132 --> 18:55.717
- IT WAS ACTUALLY
KIND OF EXCITING

18:55.801 --> 18:59.555
TO BE AT THE CENTER
OF A SCANDAL.

18:59.638 --> 19:03.392
A FEW OF THE BAD BOYS FROM
THE SENIOR CENTER FRIENDED ME.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.857
- THANKS FOR COMING BACK,
MOM.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.233
- WELL, I HAD TO
AFTER I HEARD

19:11.316 --> 19:13.068
THAT ACCEPTANCE SPEECH
AT THE AIRPORT.

19:13.151 --> 19:15.070
- I'M SO EMBARRASSED.
[chuckles]

19:15.153 --> 19:17.239
- ALL I HEARD WAS,
"I LOVE YOU, MOM."

19:17.322 --> 19:19.533
OR AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
I THINK YOU SAID.

19:19.616 --> 19:22.703
EVERYONE AROUND ME
WAS LAUGHING SO HARD.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.288
- I REALLY AM SORRY,

19:24.371 --> 19:25.914
'CAUSE I REALLY DO APPRECIATE

19:25.998 --> 19:28.750
THAT YOU FLEW ALL THE WAY
TO OHIO TO SUPPORT ME.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.169
- WELL, READING
THOSE CRUEL COMMENTS ONLINE

19:31.253 --> 19:34.047
REMINDED ME OF WHEN YOU HAD
YOUR SCOLIOSIS BRACE

19:34.131 --> 19:36.258
IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THE BOYS
WEREN'T ASKING YOU OUT

19:36.341 --> 19:39.303
AND THE MEAN GIRLS
WERE TEASING YOU.

19:39.386 --> 19:42.055
OH, I MISS THOSE DAYS.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.432
- WHAT?

19:43.515 --> 19:45.434
- I MEAN, THOSE NIGHTS
IN THE KITCHEN,

19:45.517 --> 19:47.936
TALKING IT OUT
WHILE WE MADE BROWNIES.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.064
WE WERE SO CLOSE, AND I LOVED
MAKING YOU FEEL BETTER.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.775
- OH, BROWNIE NIGHTS
DID MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.235
AND DEEP-FRIED TWINKIE NIGHTS--

19:55.319 --> 19:56.987
OH, I FELT LIKE I WAS
BEING HUGGED

19:57.070 --> 19:59.907
BY A THOUSAND
CREAM-FILLED ANGELS.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.450
- OKAY, IN HINDSIGHT,

20:01.533 --> 20:03.911
MAYBE I DID REINFORCE
SOME BAD PATTERNS.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.455
- YEAH, BUT MAYBE
I'VE GOTTEN TO AN AGE

20:06.538 --> 20:07.956
WHERE I HAVE TO STOP BLAMING
MY MOM

20:08.040 --> 20:09.458
FOR THE THINGS THAT I DO.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.792
- OH, SWEETIE,
YOU'RE NEVER TOO OLD

20:10.876 --> 20:12.127
TO BLAME YOUR MOTHER.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.629
I STILL BLAME MINE.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.632
YOUR GRANDMOTHER
WAS A PIECE OF WORK.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.300
- YEAH, MAYBE
IT'S ALL HER FAULT.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.094
- I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.514
- OH, HEY, YOU TWO,
I KNOW YOU'RE DIETING,

20:24.598 --> 20:26.266
BUT WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME CAKE AND CHAMPAGNE?

20:26.350 --> 20:27.476
- ABSOLUTELY.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.435
- IT'S A WELL-KNOWN RULE

20:28.518 --> 20:31.438
THERE ARE NO CALORIES
IN CELEBRATION FOOD.

20:31.521 --> 20:33.023
- WHOSE RULE IS THAT?

20:33.106 --> 20:34.733
both:
IT'S A RULE.
