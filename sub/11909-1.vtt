02:48.240 --> 02:51.528
I learn in this letter that Don Pedro
of Arragon comes this day to Messina.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.481
LEONATO'S AIDE:
He is very near by this, not three leagues off.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.927
Have any gentlemen been lost in this action?

02:57.000 --> 03:00.846
But few of any sort, and none of name.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.121
A victory is twice itself
when the achiever brings home full numbers.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.047
I find here that Don Pedro
hath bestowed much honor

03:08.120 --> 03:10.248
upon a young Florentine called Claudio.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.487
LEONATO'S AIDE: Much deserved on his part
and equally remembered by Don Pedro,

03:14.560 --> 03:16.688
he hath borne himself
beyond the promise of his age,

03:16.800 --> 03:20.088
doing, in the figure of a lamb,
the feats of a lion.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.201
Rarh!

03:23.280 --> 03:27.126
I pray you, is Signior Mountanto
returned from the wars or no?

03:27.200 --> 03:28.690
LEONATO'S AIDE:
I know none of that name, lady.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.603
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.889
O, he's returned
and as pleasant as ever he was.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.521
I pray you, how many hath he killed
and eaten in these wars?

03:38.080 --> 03:39.206
But how many hath he killed?

03:39.320 --> 03:41.891
For indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.

03:42.440 --> 03:45.046
Faith, niece,
you tax Signior Benedick too much,

03:45.160 --> 03:46.810
but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.644
He hath done good service, lady,
in these wars.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.769
You had musty victual,
and he hath holp to eat it.

03:53.840 --> 03:57.242
He is a very valiant trencherman,
he hath an excellent stomach.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.322
LEONATO'S AIDE:
And a good soldier too, lady.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.324
And a good soldier to a lady.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.161
But what is he to a lord?

04:04.360 --> 04:08.604
A lord to a lord, a man to a man,
stuffed with all honorable virtue.

04:08.720 --> 04:12.167
It is so, indeed,
he is no less than a stuffed man.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.128
You must not, sir, mistake my niece.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.682
There is a kind of merry war
betwixt Signior Benedick and her.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.963
They never meet
but there's a skirmish of wit between them.

04:22.040 --> 04:26.170
Who is his companion now?
He hath every month a new sworn brother.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.601
LEONATO'S AIDE: Is't possible?

04:27.680 --> 04:29.523
Very easily possible.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.251
He wears his faith
but as the fashion of his hat,

04:32.320 --> 04:34.129
it ever changes with the next block.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.486
(CHUCKLES)

04:35.560 --> 04:38.689
I see, lady,
the gentleman is not in your books.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.884
No, and he were, I would burn my study.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.810
But, I pray you, who is his companion?

04:45.880 --> 04:49.726
Is there no young squarer now that will
make a voyage with him to the devil?

04:50.120 --> 04:53.647
He is most in the company
of the right noble Claudio.

04:53.760 --> 04:57.651
O, lord, he will hang upon him like a disease.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.805
He is sooner caught than the pestilence,
and the taker runs presently mad.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.850
O, God help the noble Claudio!

05:04.960 --> 05:06.371
If he have caught the Benedick,

05:06.440 --> 05:08.807
it will cost him a thousand pound
ere he be cured.

05:08.880 --> 05:09.927
(ALL LAUGHING)

05:54.280 --> 05:55.725
Good Signior Leonato,

05:56.240 --> 05:58.208
you are come to welcome your trouble.

05:58.280 --> 06:01.204
The fashion of the world is to avoid cost,
and you encounter it.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.368
Never came trouble to my house
in the likeness of your grace.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.091
For trouble being gone,
comfort should remain.

06:09.800 --> 06:13.566
But when you depart from me sorrow abides
and happiness takes his leave.

06:13.640 --> 06:17.042
DON PEDRO: Hmm, you embrace
your charge too willingly.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.403
I think this is your daughter.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.130
Her mother hath many times told me so.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.049
Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?

06:29.120 --> 06:31.646
Signior Benedick, no,
for then were you a child.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.087
Truly, truly, the lady fathers herself.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.481
Be happy, lady,
for you are like an honorable father.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.609
BENEDICK: If Signior Leonato be her father,

06:38.680 --> 06:41.251
she would not have his head
on her shoulders for all Messina

06:41.480 --> 06:43.084
as like him as she is.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.606
I wonder that you would still be talking,
Signior Benedick.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.960
Nobody marks you.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.520
What, my dear Lady Disdain!
Are you yet living?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.523
Is it possible disdain should die

06:51.640 --> 06:55.326
while she hath such meet food
to feed it as Signior Benedick?

06:55.640 --> 06:59.167
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain,
if you come in her presence.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.442
Then is courtesy a turncoat.

07:01.520 --> 07:06.686
But it is certain I am loved of all ladies,
only you excepted,

07:06.960 --> 07:10.965
and I would I could find it in my heart
that I had not a hard heart,

07:11.040 --> 07:13.202
for, truly, I love none.

07:13.280 --> 07:18.320
Dear happiness to women, else would they
have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.523
I thank God and my cold blood,
I am of your humor for that.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.889
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow
than a man swear he loves me.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.928
God keep your ladyship still in that mind

07:28.000 --> 07:31.163
so some gentleman or other
shall 'scape a predestinate scratched face.

07:31.240 --> 07:34.687
Scratching could not make it worse,
an 'twere such a face as yours were.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.808
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.928
Um, a bird of my tongue
is better than a beast of yours.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.527
I would my horse had the speed
of your tongue, and so good a continuer.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.722
But keep in your way,
God's name, I have done.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.488
You always end with a jade's trick.

07:52.760 --> 07:53.966
I know you of old.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.122
Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato
hath invited you all.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.487
I tell him we shall stay here
at the least the month,

08:01.560 --> 08:04.769
and he heartily prays some occasion
may detain us longer.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.046
(CAMERA CLICKS)

08:08.120 --> 08:09.246
DON PEDRO: Lady.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.487
Let me bid you welcome, my lord.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.881
Being reconciled with the prince your brother,

08:15.160 --> 08:16.924
I owe you all duty.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.091
Thank you.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.642
I am not of many words, but I thank you.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.125
Please it your grace lead on?

08:27.760 --> 08:30.889
Your hand, Leonato. We will go together.

08:36.919 --> 08:40.207
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter
of Signior Leonato?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.647
I noted her not, but I looked on her.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.529
Is she not a modest young lady?

08:44.600 --> 08:46.648
Do you question me,
as an honest man should do,

08:46.720 --> 08:48.529
for my simple true judgment,

08:48.600 --> 08:50.523
or would you have me speak after my custom,

08:50.600 --> 08:52.967
as being a professed tyrant to their sex?

08:53.040 --> 08:55.566
No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.727
Why, i' faith, methinks
she is too low for a high praise,

08:59.800 --> 09:03.646
too brown for a fair praise,
too little for a great praise.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.682
Only this commendation I can afford her,
that were she other than she is,

09:07.760 --> 09:09.171
she were unhandsome,

09:09.240 --> 09:11.481
and being no other than as she is,
I do not like her.

09:12.320 --> 09:16.530
Thou thinkest I am in sport.
I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.769
Would you buy her,
that you inquire after her?

09:19.880 --> 09:24.010
- Can the world buy such a jewel?
- Yea, and a case to put it into.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.846
But speak you this with a sad brow?

09:29.240 --> 09:32.562
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady
that ever I looked on.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.488
I can see yet without spectacles
and I see no such matter.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.847
There's her cousin,
an she were not possessed with a fury,

09:43.920 --> 09:48.244
exceeds her as much in beauty
as the first of May doth the last of December.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.721
But I hope you have no intent
to turn husband, have you?

09:54.360 --> 09:57.762
I would scarce trust myself,
though I had sworn the contrary,

09:57.840 --> 09:59.569
if Hero would be my wife.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.003
Is it come to this?

10:03.440 --> 10:06.683
Shall I never see a bachelor
of three-score again?

10:08.600 --> 10:12.127
Go to i' faith, an thou wilt needs
thrust thy neck into a yoke,

10:12.200 --> 10:15.204
wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.481
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- (GRUNTING)

10:16.560 --> 10:18.961
What secret hath held you here,
that you followed not Leonato?

10:19.040 --> 10:21.361
I would your grace
would constrain me to tell.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.050
I charge thee on thy allegiance.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.408
O, on my allegiance? Mark you this.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.490
On my allegiance he is in love.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.806
With who? Now that is your grace's part.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.326
Mark you how short his answer is.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.569
(MUSIC BOX PLAYING)

10:37.240 --> 10:40.005
With Hero,
Leonato's short daughter.

10:40.280 --> 10:42.681
Amen, if you love her,
for the lady is very well worthy.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.843
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.490
By my troth, I speak my thought.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.642
And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.803
And, by my two faiths and troths,
my lord, I spoke mine.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.730
- That I love her I feel.
- And that she is worthy, I know.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.482
That I neither feel how she should be loved
nor know how she should be worthy

10:58.560 --> 11:00.961
is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.008
I will die in it at the stake.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.560
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic
in the despite of beauty.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.122
That a woman conceived me,
I give her thanks,

11:08.200 --> 11:11.363
that she brought me up,
I likewise give her most humble thanks.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.006
But that I will have a recheat
winded in my forehead,

11:14.080 --> 11:18.688
or hang my bugle from an invisible baldrick,
all women shall pardon me.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.889
Because I will not do them the wrong
to mistrust any,

11:21.960 --> 11:24.611
I will do myself the right to trust none.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.287
And the fine is,
for the which I may go the finer,

11:28.560 --> 11:30.289
I will live a bachelor.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.967
I shall see thee, ere I die,
look pale with love.

11:35.640 --> 11:41.204
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger,
my lord, not with love.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.247
Well, as time shall try.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.971
"In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke."

11:47.120 --> 11:51.170
The savage bull may,
but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it,

11:51.280 --> 11:54.124
pluck off the bull's horns
and plant them in my forehead

11:54.200 --> 11:55.725
and let me be vilely painted,

11:55.800 --> 11:59.122
and in such great letters as they write,
"Here is good horse to hire,"

11:59.200 --> 12:01.248
let them signify under my sign,

12:01.320 --> 12:04.210
"Here may you see Benedick
the married man."

12:04.400 --> 12:07.882
Nay, if Cupid have not spent
all his quiver in Venice,

12:07.960 --> 12:09.246
thou wilt quake
for this shortly.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.162
I look for an earthquake too, then.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.044
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?

12:20.840 --> 12:23.571
No child but Hero, she's his only heir.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.164
Dost thou affect her,
Claudio?

12:27.320 --> 12:32.804
O, my lord, when you went onward
on this ended action,

12:32.880 --> 12:35.167
I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,

12:35.240 --> 12:36.241
that liked,

12:36.320 --> 12:40.484
but had a rougher task in hand
than to drive liking to the name of love.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.648
But now I am return'd

12:44.360 --> 12:47.489
and that war-thoughts have
left their places vacant,

12:47.560 --> 12:51.610
in their rooms come thronging soft
and delicate desires,

12:51.680 --> 12:56.242
all prompting me how fair young Hero is,

12:56.320 --> 12:59.483
saying, "I liked her ere I went to wars."

13:00.320 --> 13:06.043
Thou wilt be like a lover presently
and tire the hearer with a book of words.

13:06.720 --> 13:10.281
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,

13:10.360 --> 13:15.048
and I will break with her and with her father,
and thou shalt have her.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.525
I know we shall have reveling to-night. Hmm.

13:19.960 --> 13:26.127
I will assume thy part in some disguise
and tell fair Hero I am Claudio,

13:26.520 --> 13:31.765
and in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
and take her hearing prisoner with the force

13:32.720 --> 13:35.121
and strong encounter of my amorous tale.

13:36.520 --> 13:41.890
Then after to her father will I break,
and the conclusion is she shall be thine.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.480
(CHUCKLING)

13:51.360 --> 13:53.169
CONRADE: What the good-year, my lord.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.890
Why are you thus out of measure sad?

13:57.200 --> 14:00.090
There is no measure
in the occasion that breeds,

14:00.800 --> 14:03.167
therefore the sadness is without limit.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.527
You should hear reason.

14:05.640 --> 14:09.201
And when I have heard it,
what blessing brings it?

14:10.080 --> 14:13.243
If not a present remedy,
at least a patient sufferance.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.641
I cannot hide what I am.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.605
DON JOHN: I must be sad when I have cause
and smile at no man's jests,

14:22.960 --> 14:26.009
eat when I have stomach
and wait for no man's leisure,

14:26.080 --> 14:28.731
sleep when I am drowsy
and tend on no man's business,

14:28.800 --> 14:32.361
laugh when I am merry
and claw no man in his humor.

14:32.480 --> 14:37.771
Yea, but you must not make the full show
of this till you may do it without controlment.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.210
You have of late stood out
against your brother,

14:40.280 --> 14:42.089
and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace,

14:42.160 --> 14:44.208
where it is impossible
you should take true root

14:44.320 --> 14:46.800
but by the fair weather
that you make yourself.

14:49.120 --> 14:54.365
I had rather be a canker in a hedge
than a rose in his grace,

14:54.840 --> 14:55.966
(MOANS)

14:56.640 --> 15:00.725
and it better fits my blood to be disdained
of all than to fashion a carriage

15:00.800 --> 15:03.531
to rob love from any.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.561
(MOANS SOFTLY)

15:06.640 --> 15:11.771
In this, though I cannot be said
to be a flattering honest man,

15:11.840 --> 15:15.287
it must not be denied
but I am a plain-dealing villain.

15:16.720 --> 15:21.806
I am trusted with a muzzle
and enfranchised with a clog.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.764
If I had my mouth,

15:31.440 --> 15:34.284
Can you make no use of your discontent?

15:35.120 --> 15:38.681
I make all use of it, for I use it only.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.049
What news, Borachio?

15:52.040 --> 15:54.486
BORACHIO:
I came yonder from a great supper.

15:54.560 --> 15:58.406
The prince your brother,
is royally entertained by Leonato,

15:58.800 --> 16:02.009
and I can give you intelligence
of an intended marriage.

16:02.760 --> 16:06.367
DON JOHN: Will it serve
for any model to build mischief on?

16:07.520 --> 16:11.047
What is he for a fool
that betroths himself to unquietness?

16:11.880 --> 16:14.451
Marry, it is your brother's right hand.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.246
Who?

16:16.720 --> 16:18.882
The most exquisite Claudio?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.011
Even he.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.730
A proper squire.

16:24.040 --> 16:27.249
And who, and who?
Which way looks he?

16:30.880 --> 16:37.604
Marry, on Hero,
the daughter and heir of Leonato.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.571
A very forward March-chick.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.282
I heard it agreed upon that
the prince should woo Hero for himself,

16:45.520 --> 16:49.366
and having obtained her,
give her to Count Claudio.

16:49.440 --> 16:53.001
Come, come, let us thither.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.321
This may prove food
to my displeasure.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.688
That young start-up hath
all the glory of my overthrow.

17:00.760 --> 17:05.163
If I can cross him in any way,
I bless myself every way.

17:08.119 --> 17:11.442
You are both sure, and will assist me?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.368
To the death, my lord.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.760
Was not Count John here at supper?

17:29.840 --> 17:32.491
- I saw him not.
- BEATRICE: How tartly that gentleman looks.

17:32.880 --> 17:36.202
I never can see him
but I am heart-burned for an hour after.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.760
He is of a very melancholy disposition.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.404
He were an excellent man
that were made just in the midway

17:42.480 --> 17:44.528
between him and Benedick.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.126
The one is too like an image
and says nothing,

17:47.800 --> 17:51.407
the other too like my lady's eldest son,
evermore tattling.

thou wilt never get thee a husband,

What would I do with him?

18:15.840 --> 18:19.481
Dress him in my apparel
and make him my waiting gentlewoman?

18:19.680 --> 18:21.921
He that hath a beard is more than a youth,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.765
and he that hath no beard
is less than a man,

18:24.840 --> 18:27.605
and he that is more than a youth
is not for me,

18:27.680 --> 18:31.207
and he that is less than a man,
I am not for him.

18:32.360 --> 18:35.011
I trust you will be ruled by your father.

18:35.600 --> 18:39.491

18:40.040 --> 18:42.327
"Father, as it please you."

And yet for all that, cousin,
let him be a handsome fellow,

18:45.960 --> 18:51.569
or else make another curtsy
and say, "Father, as it please me."

Well, niece, I hope to see
you one day fitted with a husband.

but in his villainy,

do you any embassage to the Pigmies

You have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.

I have lost it.

But you have put him down, lady,
you have put him down.

So I would not he should do me, my lord,
lest I should prove the mother of fools.

Speak, Count, 'tis your cue.

30:42.760 --> 30:44.808
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy.

I give myself for you
and dote upon the exchange.

Speak, cousin, or, if you cannot,
stop his mouth with a kiss

31:03.600 --> 31:05.887
and let him not speak neither.

you have a merry heart.

Yea, my lord. I thank it, poor fool,
it keeps me on the windy side of care.

he is in her heart.

Your grace is too costly to wear every day.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.650
But, I beseech your grace, pardon me.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.690
I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.

32:04.760 --> 32:08.731
Your silence most offends me,
to be merry best becomes you,

32:08.840 --> 32:11.605
for, out of question,
you were born in a merry hour.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.524
No, sure, my lord, my mother cried,

32:15.280 --> 32:18.682
but then a star danced,
and under that was I born.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.130
There's little of the melancholy element
in her, my lord.

32:37.240 --> 32:40.642
She is never sad but when she sleeps,
and not ever sad then,

32:40.720 --> 32:42.370
for I have heard my daughter say,

32:42.480 --> 32:45.723
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness
and waked herself with laughing.

32:46.120 --> 32:48.043
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.360
O, by no means.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.323
She mocks all her wooers out of suit.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.210
She were an excellent wife for Benedick.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.281
(GASPS)

32:55.760 --> 32:58.969
O Lord, my lord,
if they were but a week married,

32:59.080 --> 33:00.161
they would talk
themselves mad.

33:01.920 --> 33:05.242
County Claudio,
when mean you to go to church?

33:05.720 --> 33:07.290
To-morrow, my lord.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.681
Time goes on crutches
till love have all his rites.

33:10.120 --> 33:13.966
Not till Monday, dear son,
which is hence a just seven-night,

33:14.040 --> 33:17.806
and a time too brief, too,
to have all things answer my mind.

33:18.080 --> 33:21.163
DON PEDRO: I warrant thee, Claudio,
the time shall not go dully by us.

33:21.920 --> 33:25.447
I will in the interim
undertake one of Hercules' labors,

33:25.520 --> 33:28.729
which is, to bring Signior Benedick
and the Lady Beatrice

33:28.800 --> 33:32.009
into a mountain of affection,
the one with the other.

33:32.080 --> 33:35.801
I would fain have it a match,
and I doubt not but to fashion it,

33:35.880 --> 33:38.486
if you three will minister assistance.

33:39.160 --> 33:42.721
My lord, I am for you,
though it cost me 10 nights' watchings.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.325
And I, my lord.

33:44.440 --> 33:45.851
DON PEDRO:
And you too, gentle Hero?

33:45.960 --> 33:47.803
I will do any modest office, my lord,

33:47.920 --> 33:49.206
to help my cousin to a good husband.

33:50.360 --> 33:53.842
Benedick is not
the unhopefullest husband that I know.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.488
Thus far can I praise him,
he is of a noble strain,

33:57.800 --> 34:02.806
of approved valor and confirmed honesty.

34:04.080 --> 34:07.607
I will teach you how to humor your cousin,
that she shall fall in love with Benedick,

34:07.680 --> 34:11.889
and I, with your two helps,
will so practice on Benedick that,

34:11.960 --> 34:15.328
in despite of his quick wit
and his queasy stomach,

34:15.480 --> 34:17.880
he shall fall in love with Beatrice.

34:17.960 --> 34:22.090
If we can do this,
Cupid is no longer an archer.

34:22.480 --> 34:27.121
His glory shall be ours,
for we are the only love-gods.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.009
(ALL LAUGHING)

34:34.320 --> 34:35.924
It is so.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.163
The Count Claudio
shall marry the daughter of Leonato.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.889
Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.

34:44.320 --> 34:49.246
Any bar, any cross,
any impediment will be medicinable to me.

34:50.199 --> 34:53.487
I am sick in displeasure to him,

34:53.719 --> 34:57.805
and whatsoever comes athwart his affection
ranges evenly with mine.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.331
How canst thou thwart this marriage?

35:13.560 --> 35:18.009
I think I told your lordship a year since,
how much I am in favor of Margaret,

35:18.080 --> 35:20.447
the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.760
I remember.

35:22.280 --> 35:25.204
I can, at any unseasonable instant
of the night,

35:25.880 --> 35:28.201
appoint her to look out
at her lady's chamber window.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.203
What life is in that,
to be the death of this marriage?

35:33.480 --> 35:36.245
The poison of that lies in you to temper.

35:40.840 --> 35:43.366
Go you to the prince your brother,

35:44.240 --> 35:47.164
spare not to tell him that
he hath wronged his honor

35:47.240 --> 35:49.129
in marrying the renowned Claudio,

35:49.200 --> 35:52.124
whose estimation do you mightily hold up,

35:54.080 --> 35:56.560
to a contaminated stale

35:57.720 --> 35:59.563
such a one as Hero.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.528
What proof shall I make of that?

36:04.920 --> 36:07.321
Proof enough to misuse the prince,

36:08.000 --> 36:12.767
to vex Claudio, to undo Hero and kill Leonato.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.562
Look you for any other issue?

36:44.440 --> 36:45.805
(SIGHS)

36:45.880 --> 36:50.124
I do much wonder that one man,
seeing how much another man is a fool

36:50.200 --> 36:52.487
when he dedicates his behaviors to love,

36:52.560 --> 36:55.643
will, after he hath laughed
at such shallow follies in others,

36:55.720 --> 36:59.327
become the argument
of his own scorn by falling in love.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.042
And such a man is Claudio.

37:02.520 --> 37:06.445
I have known when there was no music
with him but the drum and the fife,

37:06.640 --> 37:09.610
now he had rather hear the tabor and the pipe.

37:09.680 --> 37:13.730
I have known when he would have walked
10 mile a-foot to see a good armor,

37:13.800 --> 37:17.691
and now will he lie 10 nights awake,
carving the fashion of a new doublet.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.964
He was wont to speak plain
and to the purpose,

37:20.040 --> 37:22.042
like an honest man and a soldier.

37:22.120 --> 37:26.682
Now is he turned orthography,
his words a very fantastical banquet,

37:26.920 --> 37:29.400
just so many strange dishes.

37:30.400 --> 37:33.244
May I be so converted
and see with these eyes?

37:33.320 --> 37:35.687
I cannot tell, I think not.

37:36.120 --> 37:40.045
I will not be sworn,
but love may transform me to an oyster.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.529
But I'll take my oath on it,
till he have made an oyster of me,

37:43.600 --> 37:46.080
he shall never make me such a fool.

37:47.360 --> 37:50.330
One woman is fair, yet I am well.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.648
Another is wise, yet I am well.

37:52.840 --> 37:56.128
Another virtuous,
yet I am well.

37:56.760 --> 38:01.891
But till all graces be in one woman,
one woman shall not come in my grace.

38:04.360 --> 38:07.284
Rich she shall be, that's certain.

38:07.920 --> 38:11.720
Wise, or I'll none.
Virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her.

38:12.200 --> 38:16.046
Fair, or I'll never look on her.
Mild, or come not near me.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.006
Noble, or not I for an angel.

38:19.240 --> 38:22.084
Of good discourse, an excellent musician,

38:55.560 --> 38:57.403
Come hither, Leonato.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.250
What was it you told me of to-day,

38:59.320 --> 39:02.051
that your niece Beatrice was in love
with Signior Benedick?

39:02.120 --> 39:04.566
I did never think
that lady would have loved any man.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.404
No, nor I neither,

39:06.480 --> 39:10.201
but most wonderful that she should so dote
on Signior Benedick,

39:10.280 --> 39:13.727
whom she hath in all outward behaviors
seemed ever to abhor.

39:14.400 --> 39:17.370
BENEDICK: Is't possible?
Sits the wind in that corner?

39:17.880 --> 39:21.202
By my troth, my lord,
I cannot tell what to think of it

39:21.280 --> 39:25.080
but that she loves him
with an enraged affection.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.964
It is past the infinite of thought.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.810
DON PEDRO: You amaze me.

39:29.480 --> 39:34.361
I would have thought her spirit was
invincible against all assaults of affection.

39:34.840 --> 39:39.129
I would have sworn it had, my lord,
especially against Benedick.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.130
Hath she made her affection
known to Benedick?

39:41.200 --> 39:43.885
No, and swears she never will,

39:43.960 --> 39:45.041
- that is her torment.

'Tis true, indeed,
so your daughter says, "Shall I,"

39:48.800 --> 39:55.126
she says, "that so oft encountered him
with scorn, write to him that I love him?"

39:55.560 --> 39:58.643
LEONATO: O, she railed at herself,
that she should be so immodest

39:58.720 --> 40:01.291
to write to one that
she knew would flout her.

40:01.640 --> 40:04.325
"I measure him, " says she, "by my own spirit,

40:04.400 --> 40:08.405
"for I should flout him, if he writ to me.
Yea, though I love him, I should."

40:08.480 --> 40:14.522
Then down upon her knees she falls,
weeps, sobs, beats her heart,

40:14.640 --> 40:17.041
tears her hair, prays, curses,

40:17.120 --> 40:20.602
"O, sweet, Benedick! God give me patience!"

40:23.520 --> 40:25.204
I would she had bestowed
this dotage on me.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.966
I would have daffed all other respects
and made her half myself.

and hear what he will say.

40:36.520 --> 40:37.806
CLAUDIO: Hero thinks surely she will die,

40:39.600 --> 40:42.331
for she says she will die if he love her not,

40:42.400 --> 40:44.289

ere she make her love known,

'tis very possible he'll scorn it,

a good outward happiness.

41:05.320 --> 41:08.449
Before God! And, in my mind, very wise.

that are like wit.

he would modestly examine himself,

They say I will bear myself proudly,
if I perceive the love come from her.

42:02.760 --> 42:07.004
They say too that she will rather die
than give any sign of affection.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.481
I did never think to marry.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.447
I must not seem proud.

Happy are they that hear their detractions
and can put them to mending.

They say the lady is fair, 'tis a truth,
I can bear them witness.

42:34.040 --> 42:37.522
And virtuous, 'tis so, I cannot reprove it.

42:37.640 --> 42:40.803
And wise, but for loving me.

42:41.960 --> 42:46.409
By my troth, it is no addition to her wit,
nor no great argument of her folly,

for I will be horribly in love with her!

I may chance have some odd quirks

because I have railed
so long against marriage.

43:06.520 --> 43:08.807
But doth not the appetite alter?

A man loves the meat in his youth
that he cannot endure in his age.

I took no more pains for those thanks
than you take pains to thank me.

I would not have come.

"Against my will I am sent

44:53.200 --> 44:55.441
There's a double meaning in that.

"I took no more pains for those thanks
than you took pains to thank me."

44:59.240 --> 45:03.290
That's as much as to say, any pains
that I take for you is as good as thanks.

45:04.120 --> 45:07.249
If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain.

45:11.640 --> 45:14.883
If I do not love her, I am a fool.

45:16.960 --> 45:18.849
I will go get her picture.

45:23.840 --> 45:26.605
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful.

45:26.840 --> 45:30.925
I know her spirits are as coy and wild
as haggerds of the rock.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.083
But are you sure Benedick
loves Beatrice so entirely?

And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?

45:46.880 --> 45:50.202
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it,
but I persuaded them,

45:50.280 --> 45:54.604
if they loved Benedick,
to wish him restle with affection,

45:54.680 --> 45:56.284
and never to let Beatrice know of it.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.131
Why did you so?

Doth not the gentleman deserve

as much as may be yielded to a man.

46:17.280 --> 46:18.691
misprising what
they look on,

46:19.120 --> 46:23.887
and her wit values itself so highly
that to her all matter else seems weak.

46:25.040 --> 46:29.409
HERO: She cannot love, nor take no shape
nor project of affection,

46:29.480 --> 46:31.482
she is so self-endeared.

46:32.160 --> 46:34.242
Sure, I think so.

46:34.560 --> 46:37.450
And therefore certainly it were not good
she knew his love,

46:38.000 --> 46:39.889
lest she make sport at it.

46:39.960 --> 46:43.248
No, rather I will go to Benedick

46:43.400 --> 46:46.529
and counsel him to fight against his passion.

Truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
to stain my cousin with.

46:51.720 --> 46:55.247
One doth not know how much
an ill word may empoison liking.

46:55.400 --> 46:58.324
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.

46:58.560 --> 47:01.609
She cannot be so much
without true judgment.

47:01.880 --> 47:03.848
Having so swift and excellent a wit,

47:04.560 --> 47:06.688
as she is prized to have,

47:06.800 --> 47:10.850
as to refuse so rare a gentleman
as Signior Benedick.

47:10.920 --> 47:13.491
- He is the only man of Italy.
- Mmm.

47:14.120 --> 47:16.441
Always excepted my dear Claudio.

47:24.080 --> 47:26.003
Come, go in. I'll show thee some attires,

47:26.080 --> 47:29.448
and have thy counsel which is the best
to furnish me to-morrow.

47:33.240 --> 47:34.287
(GASPS)

47:34.560 --> 47:36.847
What fire is in my ears?

47:40.280 --> 47:41.964
Can this be true?

47:43.560 --> 47:48.009
Stand I condemn'd for pride
and scorn so much?

47:50.520 --> 47:52.204
Contempt, farewell.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.970
And maiden pride, <i>adieu.</i>

47:56.600 --> 47:59.649
No glory lives behind the back of such.

48:06.240 --> 48:07.765
And, Benedick,

48:10.600 --> 48:12.011
love on.

48:15.160 --> 48:17.401
I will requite thee,

48:19.320 --> 48:22.802
taming my wild heart to thy loving hand.

48:24.240 --> 48:28.404
If thou dost love,
my kindness shall incite thee

48:28.480 --> 48:31.609
to bind our loves up in a holy band.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.527
For others say thou dost deserve,

48:36.520 --> 48:40.923
and I believe it better than reportingly.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.648
DON PEDRO: I do but stay
till your marriage be consummate,

48:50.720 --> 48:51.926
and then go I toward Arragon.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.002
CLAUDIO: I'll bring you thither, my lord,
if you'll vouchsafe me.

48:54.160 --> 48:57.960
Nay, that would be as great a soil
in the new gloss of your marriage

48:58.080 --> 49:00.526
as to show a child his new coat
and forbid him to wear it.

49:00.600 --> 49:02.807
I will only be bold with Benedick
for his company,

49:02.880 --> 49:06.327
for, from the crown of his head
to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth.

49:06.400 --> 49:09.210
He hath twice or thrice
cut Cupid's bow-string

49:09.280 --> 49:12.204
and the little hangman
dare not shoot at him.

49:15.520 --> 49:16.760
(CLEARS THROAT)

49:17.280 --> 49:18.520
Gallants,

49:19.880 --> 49:23.930
I am not as I have been.

49:24.960 --> 49:28.009
So say I, methinks you are sadder.

49:28.560 --> 49:30.130
I hope he be in love.

49:30.800 --> 49:32.484
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

49:35.040 --> 49:36.041
Hang him truant!

49:36.160 --> 49:39.767
There's no true drop of blood in him,
to be truly touched with love.

49:39.840 --> 49:42.571
If he be sad, he wants money.

49:43.640 --> 49:48.521
I (SIGHS) have the toothache.

49:49.760 --> 49:51.683
What? Sigh for the toothache?

49:51.800 --> 49:56.124
Well, every one can master a grief
but he that has it.

49:57.800 --> 50:01.646
If he be not in love with some woman,
there is no believing old signs.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.923
DON PEDRO:
Hath any man seen him at the barber's?

50:04.080 --> 50:07.163
No, but the barber's man
hath been seen with him,

50:07.240 --> 50:10.528
and the old ornament of his cheek
hath already stuffed tennis-balls.

50:10.600 --> 50:15.447
Nay, a'rubs himself with civet.
Can you not smell him out by that?

50:15.640 --> 50:17.608
And when was he wont to wash his face?

50:17.680 --> 50:20.251
Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him.

50:20.320 --> 50:23.369
Conclude, conclude he is in love.

50:25.520 --> 50:27.329
Old signior, walk aside with me.

50:27.440 --> 50:30.171
I have studied eight or nine wise words
that I would speak to you,

50:30.240 --> 50:32.971
which these hobby-horses must not hear.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.123
(GIGGLING)

50:40.960 --> 50:44.123
For my life,
to break with him about Beatrice.

50:44.200 --> 50:45.361
'Tis even so.

50:45.440 --> 50:48.364
Hero and Margaret have by this
played their parts with Beatrice,

50:48.480 --> 50:51.802
and then the two bears will not
bite one another when they meet.

50:53.320 --> 50:55.800
My lord and brother, God save you.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.640
Good den, brother.

50:58.520 --> 51:02.002
If your leisure served,
I would speak with you.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.645
DON PEDRO: In private?

51:03.920 --> 51:06.002
If it please you.

51:06.200 --> 51:10.364
Yet Count Claudio may hear,
for what I would speak of concerns him.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.331
(CLEARS THROAT)

51:17.200 --> 51:18.884
What's the matter?

51:19.680 --> 51:22.081
Means your lordship
to be married to-morrow?

51:22.160 --> 51:23.207
DON PEDRO: You know he does.

51:23.280 --> 51:26.329
I know not that when he knows what I know.

51:29.960 --> 51:35.330
If there be any impediment,
I pray you, discover it.

51:37.600 --> 51:40.604
You may think I love you not.

51:40.920 --> 51:42.843
Let that appear hereafter,

51:42.920 --> 51:46.447
and aim better at me
by that I now will manifest.

51:47.560 --> 51:49.449
Why, what's the matter?

51:50.600 --> 51:52.250
The lady is disloyal.

51:53.720 --> 51:56.200
Who, Hero?

51:57.960 --> 51:59.485
Even she,

52:00.160 --> 52:02.686
Leonato's Hero, your Hero,

52:04.080 --> 52:05.161
every man's Hero...

52:05.960 --> 52:07.246
Disloyal?

52:07.400 --> 52:10.643
The word is too good
to paint out her wickedness.

52:10.880 --> 52:13.201
Think you of a worse title,
and I will fit her to it.

52:18.280 --> 52:21.363
Wonder not till further warrant.

52:22.840 --> 52:29.041
Go but with me to-night,
you shall see her chamber-window entered,

52:30.160 --> 52:32.128
even the night before her wedding-day.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.730
If you love her then

52:37.080 --> 52:38.809
to-morrow wed her.

52:40.360 --> 52:43.842
But it would better fit your honor
to change your mind.

52:46.920 --> 52:48.251
May this be so?

52:49.080 --> 52:50.844
I will not think it.

52:51.640 --> 52:54.610
If you will follow me,
I will show you enough,

52:56.240 --> 52:59.403
and when you have seen more
and heard more,

53:00.840 --> 53:02.604
proceed accordingly.

53:25.440 --> 53:26.965
Are you good men and true?

53:27.040 --> 53:28.201
VERGES: Yea, or else it were pity

53:28.280 --> 53:31.284
but they should suffer salvation,
body and soul.

53:32.920 --> 53:34.888
Give them their charge, neighbor Dogberry.

53:34.960 --> 53:39.648
First, who think you
the most desertless man to be constable?

53:41.280 --> 53:43.521
Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole,

53:44.120 --> 53:46.088
for they can write and read.

53:46.200 --> 53:48.202
Come hither, neighbor Seacole.

53:48.280 --> 53:50.203
You are thought here to be the most

53:50.280 --> 53:53.363
senseless and fit man
for the constable of the watch,

53:53.440 --> 53:55.283
therefore bear you the lantern.

53:55.600 --> 53:57.443
DOGBERRY: This is your charge.

53:59.040 --> 54:02.442
You shall comprehend all vagrom men.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.924
You are to bid any man stand,
in the prince's name.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.002
How if he will not stand?

54:10.360 --> 54:13.011
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go,

54:13.080 --> 54:14.923
and presently call
the rest of the watch together

54:15.000 --> 54:16.525
and thank God you are rid of a knave.

54:16.600 --> 54:19.251
If he will not stand when he is bidden,
he is none of the prince's subjects.

54:19.360 --> 54:23.206
True, and they are to meddle with none
but the prince's subjects.

54:23.400 --> 54:25.607
Well, you are to call at all the ale-houses,

54:25.680 --> 54:27.887
and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.

54:28.040 --> 54:29.644
How if they will not?

54:29.720 --> 54:31.848
Why, then, let them alone till they are sober.

54:31.920 --> 54:33.570
If they make you not then the better answer,

54:33.640 --> 54:35.608
you may say
they are not the men you took them for.

54:35.680 --> 54:37.967
- Well, sir...
- If you meet a thief,

54:38.720 --> 54:40.484
you may suspect him,
by virtue of your office,

54:40.560 --> 54:41.846
to be no true man,

54:41.920 --> 54:44.207
and, for such kind of men,

54:44.280 --> 54:46.601
the less you meddle or make with them,

54:46.720 --> 54:47.960
why the more is for your honesty.

54:48.040 --> 54:49.963
If we know him to be a thief,

54:50.040 --> 54:51.883
shall we not lay
hands on him?

54:55.360 --> 54:56.725
(SIGHS)

54:56.880 --> 54:58.211
You may,

54:58.960 --> 55:00.450
but I think they that touch pitch

55:00.520 --> 55:04.161
will be defiled. The most peaceable way
for you, if you do take a thief,

55:06.120 --> 55:10.205
is to let him show himself what he is
and steal out of your company.

55:11.280 --> 55:13.647
You have been always called
a merciful man, partner.

55:13.720 --> 55:16.166
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will,

55:16.240 --> 55:18.686
much more a man
who hath any honesty in him.

55:18.760 --> 55:20.205
If you hear a child cry in the night,

55:20.280 --> 55:23.568
you must call to the nurse
and bid her to still it.

55:23.840 --> 55:26.161
How if the nurse be asleep
and will not hear us?

55:26.360 --> 55:30.285
Why, then, depart in peace,
and let the child wake her with crying.

55:30.440 --> 55:33.011
This is the end of the charge.

55:33.120 --> 55:35.805
If you meet the prince in the night,
you may stay him.

55:36.160 --> 55:39.243
Nay, by'r our lady,
that I think he cannot.

55:39.960 --> 55:42.725
Marry, not without the prince be willing.

55:43.440 --> 55:46.728
For, indeed, the watch
ought to offend no man,

55:46.800 --> 55:49.929
and it is an offense
to stay a man against his will.

55:50.560 --> 55:52.005
By'r lady, I think it be so.

55:52.080 --> 55:53.570
(LAUGHING)

55:54.440 --> 55:56.920

of weight chances, call up me.

Well, masters, we hear our charge.

56:13.640 --> 56:17.850
Let us go sit upon the church-bench
till 2:00, and then all to bed.

BORACHIO: What Conrade!

56:34.680 --> 56:35.886
Peace!

56:38.560 --> 56:39.641
Stir not.

56:40.400 --> 56:41.561
Conrade, I say!

56:41.640 --> 56:43.847
Here, man, I am at thy elbow.

56:44.960 --> 56:46.405
Mass, and my elbow itched,

56:46.480 --> 56:49.245
I thought there would a scab follow.

56:50.080 --> 56:53.846
I will owe thee an answer for that.
Now forward with thy tale.

56:57.360 --> 56:59.522
(COUGHS) Stand thee close, then,

57:00.040 --> 57:03.840
and I will, like a true drunkard,
utter all to thee.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.166
Some treason, masters.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.604
Yet stand close.

57:10.040 --> 57:13.123
BORACHIO: Therefore know I have earned
of Don John a thousand ducats.

57:13.440 --> 57:16.683
Is it possible
that any villainy should be so dear?

57:18.200 --> 57:22.808
BORACHIO: I have to-night wooed Margaret,
the Lady Hero's gentlewoman,

57:22.880 --> 57:24.962
<i>by the name of Hero.</i>

57:39.400 --> 57:42.609
<i>She leans me out
at her mistress' chamber-window,</i>

57:44.040 --> 57:47.044
<i>bids me a thousand times good night.</i>

57:48.680 --> 57:50.444
I tell this tale vilely.

57:50.520 --> 57:53.410
I should first tell thee
how the prince and Claudio,

57:54.080 --> 57:56.287
<i>planted and placed by my master Don John,</i>

57:56.360 --> 57:58.727
<i>saw afar off in the orchard</i>

58:00.480 --> 58:02.050
<i>this amiable encounter.</i>

58:02.120 --> 58:04.600
CONRADE:
<i>And thought they Margaret was Hero?</i>

58:05.720 --> 58:08.246
BORACHIO:
<i>Two of them did, the prince and Claudio,</i>

58:08.320 --> 58:10.721
<i>but the devil my master
knew she was Margaret,</i>

58:10.840 --> 58:12.080
<i>and partly by his oaths</i>

58:12.160 --> 58:13.446
and partly by the dark night,

58:13.520 --> 58:16.205
but chiefly by my villainy,

58:16.280 --> 58:18.965
away went Claudio enraged,

58:19.920 --> 58:22.002
(SIGHS) swore he would
meet her next morning

58:22.080 --> 58:23.525
and there, before the whole congregation,

58:23.600 --> 58:26.251
shame her with what he saw o'er night,

58:26.320 --> 58:29.164
send her home again without a husband.

Get you some of this Carduus Benedictus,
and lay it to your heart.

Moral? No, by my troth,
I have no moral meaning.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.568
I meant, plain holy-thistle.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.642
(WHISPERING)
There thou prickest her with a thistle.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.084
(SIGHS) Madam, withdraw.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.726
The prince, the count.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.481
Signior Benedick, Don John,

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:18.846
and all the gallants of the town

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.605
- have come to fetch you to church.
- (SQUEALS)

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.601
What would you with me, honest neighbor?

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.205
Marry, sir,
I would have some confidence with you

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.044
that decerns you nearly.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.841
Brief, I pray you, for you see,
it is a busy time with me.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.850
- Marry, this it is, sir.
- Yes, in truth it is, sir.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.565
What is it, my good friends?

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.847
Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.400
His wits are not so blunt as, God help,
I would desire they were,

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.927
but, in faith,
honest as the skin between his brows.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.329
Yes, I thank God I am as honest
as any man living...

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.447
Comparisons are odorous.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.402
Neighbors, you are tedious.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.410
It pleases your worship to say so, sir,
but we are the poor duke's officers.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.920
I would fain know what you have to say.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.886
Marry, sir, our watch to-night,
excepting your worship's presence,

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.760
ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant knaves
as any in Messina.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.287
(CHUCKLING) A good old man, sir,
he will be talking. God help us.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.006
DOGBERRY:
Well said, neighbor Verges.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.844
An two men ride of a horse,
one must ride behind.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.001
LEONATO: I must leave you.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.481
A word, sir.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.446
Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended
two auspicious persons,

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.841
and we would have them
this morning examined before your worship.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.566
Take their examination yourself
and bring it me.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.371
I am now in great haste,
as it may appear unto you.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.806
It shall be suffigance.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.362
Drink some wine ere you go.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.443
Go, good partner, go.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.205
We are now to examination these men.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.922
(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.724
You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.047
No.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.766
(LEONATO LAUGHS)

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.768
To be married to her, Friar.
You come to marry her.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.124
Lady, you come hither
to be married to this count.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.040
I do.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.290
If either of you know any inward impediment
why you should not be conjoined,

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.970
I urge you to utter it upon your souls.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.565
Know you any, Hero?

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.007
None, my lord.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.286
Know you any, Count?

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.603
I dare make his answer, none.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.808
O, what men dare do!

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.290
What men may do.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.531
What men daily do,
not knowing what they do.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.928
How now! Interjections?

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.844
Why, some may be of laughing, as...

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.206
(LAUGHS)

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.162
(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.969
Stand thee by, Friar.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.084
Father, by your leave,

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:35.320
will you with free and unconstrained soul
give me this maid, your daughter?

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.725
As freely, son, as God did give her me.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.730
And what have I to give you back,

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:50.807
whose worth may counterpoise
this rich and precious gift?

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.522
Nothing, unless you render her again.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.845
Sweet prince, you learn me
noble thankfulness.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.331
(GRUNTS)

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.129
There, Leonato, take her back again.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.567
Give not this rotten orange to your friend,

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:08.170
she is but the sign
and semblance of her honor.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.444
Behold how like a maid
she blushes here!

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:18.161
Would you not swear,
all you that see her, that she were a maid

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.730
by these exterior shows?

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.325
But she is none.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.641
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.087
Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.924
- (GASPS)
- What do you mean, my lord?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.166
Not to be married,
not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.243
Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.768
have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
and made defeat of her virginity...

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.649
I know what you would say.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.564
If I have known her, you will say
she did embrace me as a husband,

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.802
and so extenuate the 'forehand sin.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.291
No, Leonato,

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.571
I never tempted her with word too large,

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.405
but, as a brother to his sister,

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.927
show'd her bashful sincerity and comely love.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.849
And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.287
Out on thee! Seeming!

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.244
I will write against it.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:12.531
You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.207
But you are more intemperate
in your blood than Venus,

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.569
or those pamper'd animals
that rage in savage sensuality.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.809
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.803
LEONATO: Sweet prince, why speak not you?

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.245
What should I speak?

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.246
I stand dishonor'd, that have gone about
to link my dear friend to a common stale.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.041
(SOBS)

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:39.886
What man was he talk'd with you
yesternight out at your window

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.450
betwixt 12:00 and 1:00?

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.488
Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.847
I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.601
Why, then are you no maiden?

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.327
Leonato,
I'm sorry you must hear.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:56.281
Upon mine honor, myself,
my brother and this grieved count

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.802
did see her, hear her, at that hour last night

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.890
talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.651
who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.929
confess'd the vile encounters
they have had a thousand times in secret.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.322
Fie. Fie! They are not to be named, my lord,

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.249
not to be spoke of.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.881
There is not enough chastity in language
but offense to utter them.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:26.281
Thus, pretty lady,
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:28.810
O Hero.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.688
What a Hero hadst thou been,

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.444
if half thy outward graces

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.889
had been placed
about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.729
But fare thee well, most foul,

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:48.731
most fair.

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:57.122
Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:05.846
Why, how now, cousin?
Wherefore sink you down?

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.363
Come, let us go.

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:14.081
These things, come thus to light,
smother her spirits up.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.046
How doth the lady?

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.850
Dead, I think. Help, uncle!

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.841
BEATRICE:
O Hero! Why, Hero?

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.046

(LEONATO GROANS)

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.810
O Fate! Take not away thy heavy hand.

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:42.728
Death were the fairest cover for her shame
that may be wish'd for.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.365
How now, cousin Hero?

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:46.169
Have comfort, lady.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.844
Dost thou look up?

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.686
Yea, wherefore should she not?

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.366
Wherefore!

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.802
Why, doth not every earthly thing
cry shame upon her?

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.123
Could she here deny the story
that is printed in her blood?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.083
Do not live, Hero. Do not ope thine eyes.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.567
Grieved I, I had but one?

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.844
Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.048
O, one too much by thee!

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.209
Why ever wast thou one?

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.169
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.487
Sir.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.563
Sir, be patient. For my own part,

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.927
I am attired in wonder
and know not what to say.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.607
O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:30.811
Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.648
No, truly not,

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:38.123
although, until last night
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.611
Confirm'd. Confirm'd.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.921
Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.561
who loved her so, that, speaking of
her foulness, wash'd it with tears?

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.290
Hence from her! Let her die!

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.007
Lady. What man is he you are accused of?

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.965
They know that do accuse me, I know none.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.971
If I know more of any man alive

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.769
than that which maiden modesty
doth warrant,

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.411
then let all my sins lack mercy.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.842
My father, prove you
that any man with me conversed

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.400
at hours unmeet or if I yesternight maintain'd

(SOBBING)

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.569
There is some strange misprision
in the princes.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.688
Two of them have the very bent of honor.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.369
If their wisdoms be misled in this,

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.522
the practice of it lives in John the bastard,

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.530
whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.650
I know not.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:42.206
But if they speak but truth,
these hands shall tear thee.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.765
If they wrong her honor,

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.730
the proudest of them shall well hear of it.

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.687
Pause awhile,
and let my counsel sway you in this case.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:57.005
Your daughter here the princes left for dead.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.560
Let her be kept awhile secretly inside,

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:02.451
and publish it that she is dead indeed.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.884
What shall become of this?

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.529
When Claudio shall hear
that she has died upon his words,

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:14.487
the idea of her life shall sweetly creep
into the study of his imagination.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.967
And every organ of her lovely life

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.924
shall come apparell'd
in more precious habit,

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.646
more moving-gentle and full of life,

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.768
into the eye and prospect of his soul,

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.966
than when she lived indeed.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.526
Then shall he mourn.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.926
If ever love had interest in his liver,

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.365
and wish he had not so accused her,

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:38.842
no, though he thought
his accusation to be true.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:45.291
Sir, Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.002
Being that I flow in grief

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.327
the smallest twine may lead me.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.651
Come, lady. Die to live.

have you wept all this while?

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.006
Yea,

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.201
and I will weep a while longer.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.483
I will not desire that.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.085
You have no reason, I do it freely.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.010
Surely I do believe
your fair cousin is wronged.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.169
The man might deserve of me
who would right her.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:53.085
Is there any way to show such friendship?

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.764
A very even way,

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.009
but no such friend.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.050
May a man do it?

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.522
It is a man's office, but not yours.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.002
I do love nothing in the world so well as you.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.563
Is not that strange?

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.011
As strange as the thing I know not.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:31.244
It were as possible for me to say
I loved nothing so much as you.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.484
But believe me not, and yet I lie not.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.369
I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.802
I am sorry for my cousin.

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.805
By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:47.002
Do not swear, and eat it.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.481
I will swear by it that you love me

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:53.366
and I will make him eat it
that says I love not you.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.845
Will you not eat your word?

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.491
With no sauce that can be devised to it.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.927
I protest I love thee.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.969
Why, then, God forgive me.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.282
What offense, sweet Beatrice?

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.442
You have stayed me in a happy hour.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.561
I was about to protest that I love you.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.566
And do it with all thy heart.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:21.123
I love you with so much of my heart
that none is left to protest.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.921
(GASPS)

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.370
Come, bid me do any thing for thee.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.124
Kill Claudio.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.289
Not for the wide world.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.289
You kill me to deny it.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.964
- Farewell.
- Tarry.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.407
Sweet Beatrice.

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.721
I am gone, though I am here.
There is no love in you.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.370
- Nay, I pray you, let me go.
- Beatrice...

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.249
In faith, I will go.

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.209
We'll be friends first.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.204
You dare easier be friends with me
than fight with my enemy.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.725
Is Claudio thine enemy?

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:18.322
Is he not approved in the height a villain,

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:22.644
that hath slandered, scorned,
dishonored my kinswoman?

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.164
O that I were a man!

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.401
What, bear her in hand
until they come to take hands,

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.928
and then
with public accusation,

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.561
uncovered slander, unmitigated rancor...

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.166
O God, that I were a man!

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.647
I would eat his heart in the market-place.

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:42.846
BENEDICK: Hear me, Beatrice...

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.526
Talk with a man at a window.

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.611
O a proper saying.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.681
Nay, but, Beatrice...

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.046
Sweet Hero.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:56.047
She is wronged,
she is slandered, she is undone.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.561
Beatrice.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.646
Princes and counties.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.285
A goodly count.
O that I were a man for his sake!

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.007
Or that I had any friend
who would be a man for my sake!

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.449
But manhood is melted into curtsies,
valor into compliment,

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:17.922
and men are only turned into tongues,
and trim ones too.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.881
For he is now as valiant as Hercules
who only tells a lie and swears it!

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.450
(SOBBING)

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.001
I cannot be a man with wishing,

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.044
therefore I will die a woman with grieving.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.001
By this hand, I love thee.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.081
Use it for my love some other way
than swearing by it.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:13.927
Think you in your soul
the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.283
As sure as I have thought or a soul.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.600
Enough, I am engaged.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.049
I will challenge him.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.329
I will kiss your hand.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:49.202
By this hand,
Claudio shall render me a dear account.

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.610
As you hear of me,

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.329
so think of me.

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.963
Go, comfort your cousin.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.208
I must say she is dead.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.690
And so, farewell.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.248
DOGBERRY: What is your name, friend?

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.600
Borachio.

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.169
Pray, write down, Borachio.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.888
DOGBERRY: Yours, sirrah?
CONRADE: My name is Conrade.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.966
Masters, do you serve God?

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.484
Yea, sir, we hope.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.447
Write down, that they hope they serve God.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:58.564
And write God first,

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.049
for God defend but God should go
before such villains.

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.201
Masters, it is proved already
that you are little better than false knaves,

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.643
and will go near to be thought so shortly.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.041
How answer you for yourselves?

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.561
Marry, sir, we say we are none.

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.123
A marvelous witty fellow, I assure you,
but I will go about with her.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.406
A word in your ear, sir.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.321
I say to you,
you are false knaves.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.964
Sir, I say to you we are none.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.246
(LAUGHS) Well, stand aside.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.446
(WHISPERS) 'Fore God,
they are both in a tale.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.042
Have you writ down, that they are none?

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.202
Master constable,
you go not the way to examine.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.487
You must call forth the watch
that are their accusers.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.210
Yea, marry, that is the eftest way.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.322
Let the watch come forth.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:54.846
Masters, I charge you in the prince's name

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.567
accuse these men.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.288
This man said, sir, that Don John,
the prince's brother, was a villain.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.371
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.607
Write down, "Prince John a villain."

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.129
Why, that's flat perjury,
to call a prince's brother villain.

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.647
- BORACHIO: Master constable...
- Pray thee, fellow, peace.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.882
I do not like thy look, I promise thee.

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.605
What heard you him say else?

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:25.129
Marry, that he had received
a thousand ducats of Don John

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.441
for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.211
Flat burglary as ever was committed.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.442
Yea, by mass, that it is!

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.401
What else, fellows?

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:42.086
And that Count Claudio did mean,
upon his words,

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.640
to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.000
and not marry her.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.884
O villain.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.721
Thou wilt be condemned
into everlasting redemption for this.

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.801
What else?

01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:59.245
This is all.

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:03.763
And this is more, masters,
than you can deny.

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.004
Prince John is this morning
secretly stolen away,

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.410
Hero was in this manner accused,
in this very manner refused,

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:13.131
and upon this grief suddenly died.

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:18.408
Master constable, let these men be bound,
and brought to Leonato.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:21.211
I will go before
and show him their examination.

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.566
Come, let them be opinioned.

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.847
- VERGES: Let them be in the hands...
- Off, coxcomb!

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.450
DOGBERRY:
God's my life, where's the sexton?

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.126
Let her write down
the prince's officer coxcomb.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.884
Come, bind them.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.001
Thou naughty varlet!

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.327
Away! You are an ass!

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.963
You are an ass.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.202
Dost thou not suspect my place?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.241
Dost thou not suspect my years?

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.089
O that she were here
to write me down an ass.

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.331
But, masters, remember that I am an ass,

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.088
though it be not written down,
yet forget not that I am an ass.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.284
Thou villain, thou art full of piety,

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:20.570
as shall be proved upon thee
by good witness.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.688
I am a wise fellow,
and, which is more, an officer,

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.330
and, which is more, a householder,

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.610
and, which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh
as any is in Messina,

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.680
and one that knows the law, go to.

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:37.451
And a rich fellow enough, go to.

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:39.768
And a fellow that hath had losses,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.005
and one that hath two gowns
and every thing handsome about him!

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:51.006
O that I had been
writ down an ass!

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:08.523
Now, signior, what news?

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.130
Good day, my lord.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.681
We've been up and down to seek thee,

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:19.482
for we are high-proof melancholy
and would fain have it beaten away.

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.531
Wilt thou use thy wit?

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.764
It is in my scabbard, shall I draw it?

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.644
DON PEDRO:
Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.491
Never any did so,
though very many have been beside their wit.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.404
I will bid thee draw,

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.562
as we do the minstrels, draw, to pleasure us.

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:41.241
As I'm an honest man, he looks pale.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.163
Art thou sick, or angry?

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:44.721
What, courage, man!

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:49.807
What though care killed a cat
thou hast mettle in thee to kill care.

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.082
But when shall we set
the savage bull's horns

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.969
on the sensible Benedick's head?

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:58.045
Yea, and text underneath,
"Here dwells Benedick the married man"?

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.327
Shall I speak a word in your ear?

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.569
- God bless me from a challenge.
- (SLAPS)

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.843
You are a villain. I jest not.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.964
I will make it good how you dare,
with what you dare, and when you dare.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.681
Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.928
Well, I will meet you,
so I may have good cheer.

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.644
My lord, for your many courtesies,
I thank you.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.529
I must discontinue your company.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.964
Your brother the bastard
is fled from Messina.

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:35.081
You have among you
killed a sweet and innocent lady.

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.888
For my Lord Lackbeard, there,
he and I shall meet.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.690
And, till then, peace be with you.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:50.081
Did he not say, my brother was fled?

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.083
Officers, what offense
have these men done?

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.481
Marry, sir, they have committed false report.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.130
Moreover, they have spoken untruths.

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.009
Secondarily, they are slanders.

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.890
Sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.523
Thirdly, they have verified unjust things,

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.682
and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.888
This learned constable
is too cunning to be understood.

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.041
What's your offense?

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:24.602
Sweet Prince, let me go
no farther to mine answer.

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:27.564
Do you hear me, and let this count kill me.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.280
I have deceived even your very eyes.

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.563
What your wisdoms could not discover,
these shallow fools have brought to light.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.008
Who overheard me confessing
how your brother incensed me

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.367
to slander the Lady Hero,

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:43.124
how you saw me court Margaret
in Hero's garments,

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.123
how you disgraced her.

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.131
My villainy they have upon record,

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.771
which I had rather seal with my death
than repeat over to my shame.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.966
(SIGHS)

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:54.369
Runs not this speech
like iron through your blood?

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.530
I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:00.811
Come, bring away the plaintiffs,

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:03.531
and, masters, do not forget to specify,

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.809
when time and place shall serve,
that I am an ass.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.564
Which is the villain?

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.160
Let me see his eyes,
that, when I note another man like him,

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.481
I may avoid him. Which of these is he?

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:22.724
If you would know your wronger, look on me.

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:29.931
Art thou the slave that with thy breath
hast kill'd mine innocent child?

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.608
Yea, even I alone.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.844
No, not so, villain.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.449
Here stand a pair of honorable men,
a third is fled, that had a hand in it.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.209
I thank you, Princes,
for my daughter's death.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:49.564
Record it with thy high and worthy deeds.

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.684
'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.

01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:58.485
I know not how to pray your patience,
yet I must speak.

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.887
Choose your revenge yourself,

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:07.360
impose on me what penance your invention
can lay upon my sin,

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.920
yet sinn'd I not but in mistaking.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.802
By my soul, nor I.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.610
And to satisfy this good old man,

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.765
I would bend under any heavy weight
that he'll enjoin me to.

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.891
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live.

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.609
That were impossible.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.403
But, I pray you both,

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.520
possess the people in Messina here
how innocent she died,

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.363
and if your love can labor
ought in sad invention,

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:43.126
hang her an epitaph upon her tomb

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:45.722
and sing it to her bones.

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.404
Sing it to-night.

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.131
To-morrow morning come you to my house,

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:01.961
for since you could not be my son-in-law,
be yet my nephew.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.889
My brother hath a daughter,

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.327
almost the copy of my child that's dead,

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.926
and she alone is heir to both of us.

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:14.168
Give her the right
you should have given her cousin,

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.442
and so dies my revenge.

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.124
I do embrace your offer

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:26.084
and dispose for henceforth of poor Claudio.

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.850
This naughty man shall face to face
be brought to Margaret,

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:35.048
who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.531
hired to it by your brother.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.687
No.

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:40.123
By my soul, she was not,

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.930
nor knew not what she did
when she spoke to me.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.527
But always hath been just and virtuous
in any thing I do know by her.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.886
Moreover, sir.

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.168
Although it be not under white and black,

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:53.523
this plaintiff here, the offender,
did call me ass.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.765
I beseech you,
let it be remembered in her punishment.

01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:00.131
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:03.369
God keep your worship.
I humbly give you leave to depart,

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.483
and should a merry meeting be wished,

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:08.690
God prohibit it.

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:12.770
Come, neighbor.

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:21.800
Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.850
We will not fail.

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.042
Bring you these fellows on.

BENEDICK: O!

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.682
Pray thee, Mistress Margaret,
deserve well at my hands

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.888
by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.288
Will you then write me a sonnet
in praise of my beauty?

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:29.684
In so high a style, Margaret,
that no man living shall come over it,

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:32.891
for, in most comely truth, thou deservest it.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.411
(SIGHS)

01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.648
To have no man come over me.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.962
Why, shall I always keep below stairs?

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:43.806
Thy wit is as quick
as the greyhound's mouth,

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.405
it catches.

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:48.849
And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils,

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:50.888
which hit, but hurt not.

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:54.927
A most manly wit, Margaret,
it will not hurt a woman.

01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:00.088
So, I pray thee, call Beatrice.
I give thee bucklers.

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:05.971
Give us the swords,
we have bucklers of our own.

<i>Knows me, and knows me</i>

<i>How pitiful I deserve...</i>

(DOGS BARK)

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:33.166
I mean in singing.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:38.282
But in loving, Leander the good swimmer,

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.806
Troilus the first employer of panders,

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:45.408
why, they were never so truly turned over
and over as my poor self in love.

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:51.206
Marry, I cannot show it in rhyme, I have tried.

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:56.451
I can find out no rhyme to "lady" but "baby,"

01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:00.882
an innocent rhyme. For "scorn, " "horn,"

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.403
a hard rhyme. For "school, " "fool,"

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:08.041
a babbling rhyme. Very ominous endings.

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.684
No, I was not born under a rhyming planet.

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.606
Nor I cannot woo in festival terms.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:18.330
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING))

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:25.490
Sweet Beatrice,
wouldst thou come when I called thee?

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:28.970
Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.644
O, stay but till then!

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.567
"Then" is spoken, fare you well now.

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:36.243
And yet, ere I go.

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:40.248
Let me go with that I came,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.083
which is, knowing what hath passed
between you and Claudio.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.686
Only foul words,
and thereupon I will kiss thee.

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:49.809
Foul words is but foul wind,
and foul wind is but foul breath,

01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:53.930
and foul breath is noisome,
therefore I will depart unkissed.

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:56.920
Thou hast frighted the word
out of his right sense,

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.128
so forcible is thy wit.

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:03.371
But I must tell thee plainly,
Claudio undergoes my challenge

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:07.965
and either I will shortly hear from him,
or I will subscribe him a coward.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.486
And, I pray thee, now,

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:20.285
tell me for which of my bad parts
didst thou first fall in love with me?

01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:22.810
For them all together,

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:26.130
which maintained so politic a state of evil

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:30.165
that they would not admit any good part
to intermingle with them.

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.171
But for which of my good parts
did you first suffer love for me?

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.163
Suffer love! A good epithet!

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.726
I do suffer love, indeed,

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:41.924
for I love thee against my will.

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.160
In spite of your heart, I think.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:48.164
If you will spite it for my sake,
I will spite it for yours,

01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:51.524
for I could never love
that which my friend hates.

01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:54.564
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:59.124
I pray thee, now tell me,
how doth your cousin?

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.726
Very ill.

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:03.685
And how do you?

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:06.325
Very ill, too.

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:14.605
Serve God, love me, and mend.

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:18.644
Madam, you must come to your uncle!

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:21.446
It is proved my Lady Hero
hath been falsely accused,

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:24.283
the prince and Claudio mightily abused,

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:27.682
and Don John is the author of all,
who's fled and gone.

Will you come presently?

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.042
BEATRICE:
Will you come hear this news, signior?

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.724
I will live in thy heart,

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.962
die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes,

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:38.647

FRIAR FRANCIS:
Did I not tell you she was innocent?

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:46.887
LEONATO:
So are the prince and Claudio,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.209
who accused her upon the error
that you heard debated.

01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:54.320
But Margaret was in some fault for this,
although against her will,

01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:57.241
as it appears
in the true course of all the question.

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:58.720
FRIAR FRANCIS: Well.

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.288
I am glad that all things sort so well.

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:04.091
Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.167
To do what, signior?

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:08.961
To bind me, or undo me, one of them.

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.563
Signior Leonato, truth it is, good sir,

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.202
your niece regards me with an eye of favor.

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:19.610
That eye my daughter lent her 'tis most true.

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:22.566
And I do with an eye of love requite her.

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:25.287
The sight whereof I think you had from me,

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.129
from Claudio, and the prince.

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.249
But what's your will?

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.762
Your answer, sir, is enigmatical.

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:36.641
For my will,
my will is your good will may stand with ours

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:41.681
in this day to be conjoin'd
in the state of honorable marriage.

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:46.483
In which, dear Friar,
I shall entreat your pains.

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.606
Good morrow to this fair assembly.

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.967
Good morrow, Prince.
Good morrow, Claudio.

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.127
We here attend you.

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.290
Are you yet determined to-day
to marry with my brother's daughter?

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:22.411
I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:26.925
Come forth.

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:30.208
Here's the friar. Ready.

01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:34.408
Which is the lady I must seize upon?

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:35.686
LEONATO: This same is she,

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:39.209
and I do give you her.

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.889
Why, then she's mine.

01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:46.530
Sweet, let me see your face.

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.002
No, that you shall not,

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:55.447
till you take her hand before this friar
and swear to marry her.

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:02.606
Give me your hand.

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.248
Before this holy friar,

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:16.204
I am your husband, if you like of me.

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:20.051
And when I lived, I was your other wife.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:31.561
And when you loved,
you were my other husband.

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.205
Another Hero!

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.406
Nothing certainer.

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.205
One Hero died defiled, but I do live,

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.442
and surely as I live,

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.370
I am a maid.

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:51.606
The former Hero? Hero that is dead?

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:55.883
She died, my lord,
but whiles her slander lived.

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:01.488
FRIAR FRANCIS:
All this amazement can I qualify.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.881
When after that the holy rites are ended,

01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:06.042
I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death.

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.608
Meantime let wonder seem familiar,

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:11.331
and to the chapel let us presently.

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:13.169
BENEDICK: Soft and fair, friar.

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.609
Which is Beatrice?

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:21.769
I answer to that name.

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.404
What is your will?

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:39.444
Do not you love me?

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:42.405
Why, no,

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:46.121
no more than reason.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.649
Why, then your uncle
and the prince and Claudio

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:51.722
have been deceived. They swore you did.

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:53.290
Do not you love me?

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.767
Troth, no, no more than reason.

01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:59.845
Why, then my cousin Margaret
and Ursula are much deceived,

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.524
for they did swear you did.

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.329
They swore you were almost sick for me.

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:06.404
Well, they swore that
you were well-nigh dead for me.

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.289
'Tis no such matter.

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.002
Then you do not love me?

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:15.046
No,

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:20.762
truly, but in friendly recompense.

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:23.206
LEONATO: Come, cousin,

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:27.000
I am sure you love the gentleman.

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:31.681
And I'll be sworn upon it that he loves her,

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:34.764
for here's a paper written in his hand,

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:37.810
a halting sonnet of his own pure brain,

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.843
fashion'd to Beatrice.

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:42.450
(GRUNTING)

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:46.728
And here's another writ in my cousin's hand,

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:50.600
stolen from her pocket,
containing her affection unto Benedick.

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.371
(GRUNTING)

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.411
A miracle.

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.441
Here's our own hands against our hearts.

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.568
Come, I'll have thee,

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:14.963
but, by this light, I take thee for pity.

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:18.249
O, I would not deny you,

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:21.762
but, by this good day,
I yield upon great persuasion

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:27.044
and partly to save your life,
for I was told you were in a consumption.

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:30.245
Peace. I will stop your mouth.

01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:46.763
How dost thou, Benedick the married man?

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.200
I'll tell thee what, Prince,

01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:54.648
a college of wit-crackers
cannot flout me out of my humor.

01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:56.927
Thinkest thou I care
for a satire or an epigram?

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.480
No, since I do purpose to marry,

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.687
I will think nothing to any purpose
that the world can say against it,

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:07.765
and therefore never flout at me
for what I have said against it,

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.322
for man is a giddy thing,

01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.922
and this is my conclusion.

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:15.086
LEONATO'S AIDE: My lord.

01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:17.808
Your brother John is ta'en in flight,

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:20.605
and brought with armed men back to Messina.

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.250
BENEDICK: Think not on him till to-morrow.

01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:26.608
I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.767
Let's dance ere we are married,

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:34.127
that it may lighten our hearts
and our wives' heels.

01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:35.770
We'll have dancing afterward.

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:38.889
First, upon my word. Therefore, play, music.

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:41.043
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:47.285
Prince, thou art sad.

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.322
Get thee a wife, get thee a wife.

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:56.322
