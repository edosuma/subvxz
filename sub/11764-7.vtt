WEBVTT

00:01.672 --> 00:03.234
(grunts) WELL,
ARE YOU GUYS GONNA HELP,

00:03.234 --> 00:05.276
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA
WATCH ME STRUGGLE?

00:05.276 --> 00:07.038
WATCH YOU STRUGGLE.
THE SECOND ONE,

00:07.038 --> 00:09.280
BUT STILL,
IT'S CUTE SEEING YOU AS A DAD.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.441
REALLY?

00:10.441 --> 00:14.185
TOTALLY, BUT SOMETIMES
I DO FEEL, UH, A LITTLE,

00:14.185 --> 00:15.716
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

00:15.716 --> 00:17.118
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY ABOUT

00:17.118 --> 00:21.021
THE DITZY, TRASHY, FAKE BLONDE,
FAKE TAN, FAKE BOOB, CLUB SKANK

00:21.021 --> 00:24.055
YOU ONE-NIGHT-STANDED
TO MAKE THAT BABY.

00:24.055 --> 00:25.156
SHE SAYS IT BETTER.

00:25.156 --> 00:28.199
(singsongy)
THAT IS NOT TRUE, JILL.

00:28.199 --> 00:31.162
YOUR MOMMY AND I HAD
A ONE-AFTERNOON STAND.

00:31.162 --> 00:33.164
JILL?
I THOUGHT HER NAME WAS TAMPA.

00:33.164 --> 00:35.466
YEAH. HER MOM NAMED
HER "TAMPA,"

00:35.466 --> 00:36.667
BUT SHE LET ME PICK
THE MIDDLE NAME,

00:36.667 --> 00:38.669
SO FROM NOW ON
WE'RE CALLING HER "JILL."

00:38.669 --> 00:41.212
I'M GONNA STICK WITH "TAMPA"
'CAUSE YOU HATE IT SO MUCH.

00:41.212 --> 00:42.513
DITTO.

00:42.513 --> 00:44.175
(thudding)
WHAT THE HELL?

00:44.175 --> 00:45.276
I NEED A CORKSCREW.

00:45.276 --> 00:48.149
OH. I BABY-PROOFED
THE HOUSE BECAUSE JILL--

00:48.149 --> 00:49.150
TAMPA.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.051
JILL WILL BE STAYING HERE
A LOT.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.052
OHH.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.424
(grunts)

00:53.424 --> 00:56.056
WELL, ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME
OR JUST WATCH ME STRUGGLE?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.088
THE SECOND ONE.

00:57.088 --> 01:00.561
(strained voice)
MOTHER OF GOD, I'VE GOTTA DRINK!

01:00.561 --> 01:06.837
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:06.837 --> 01:08.269
AH.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.201
ARE THESE PICTURES
OF YOU AND BOBBY

01:10.201 --> 01:11.772
FROM AN OLD HUNTING TRIP?

01:11.772 --> 01:13.144
THEY'RE OUR WEDDING PHOTOS.

01:13.144 --> 01:14.675
WE DROVE DOWN THE AISLE
IN AN A.T.V.

01:14.675 --> 01:18.109
WHEN I GET MARRIED, I HOPE
I'M JUST AS PREGNANT AS YOU.

01:18.109 --> 01:19.510
AW.
DID YOUR PHOTOGRAPHER SUCK,

01:19.510 --> 01:22.153
OR DO YOU KNOW A LOT
OF PEOPLE WITHOUT HEADS?

01:22.153 --> 01:24.855
OH, THAT'S BOBBY'S UNCLE.
(sighs) HE WAS REALLY SWEET,

01:24.855 --> 01:26.387
BUT WHEN WE OPENED
OUR PHOTOGRAPHS,

01:26.387 --> 01:28.459
THERE WERE, LIKE,
NINE PICTURES OF HIS PENIS.

01:28.459 --> 01:30.421
OOH.
HE'S ACTUALLY IN JAIL NOW.

01:30.421 --> 01:32.092
OH.
(door opens)

01:32.092 --> 01:34.695
SO THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA USE
A PROFESSIONAL.
(door closes)

01:34.695 --> 01:36.197
HEY, HEY, HEY.

01:37.468 --> 01:39.099
YOU GUYS NOTICE ANYTHING?
(chuckles)

01:40.201 --> 01:42.233
THE HELMET'S GONE!

01:42.233 --> 01:43.274
YOU HAD A HELMET?

01:43.274 --> 01:45.176
GOD, I REALLY THOUGHT
THAT WOULD BE A BIGGER DEAL.

01:45.176 --> 01:47.478
OH, WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHERS,
HUH?

01:47.478 --> 01:49.680
YOU GUYS WANT TO SEE
SOME REAL PHOTOGRAPHY?

01:49.680 --> 01:51.142
YOU KNOW WE WOULD.

01:51.142 --> 01:53.113
(snaps fingers)
I'LL GET MY PORTFOLIO.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.215
RUN!
AAH!

01:54.215 --> 01:57.388
FREEZE! NOW YOU SMILE
AND DRINK YOUR WINE.

01:57.388 --> 02:00.621
MM. FOUND A LITTLE PIECE
OF GLASS.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.293
(glass shard clatters)

02:02.293 --> 02:04.595
THIS SANGRIA REMINDS ME
OF WHEN I WENT TO PAMPLONA

02:04.595 --> 02:06.157
TO PHOTOGRAPH
THE RUNNING OF THE BULLS.

02:06.157 --> 02:08.629
THIS GUY I WAS SHACKING UP
WITH, MIGUEL, RAN IT WITH ME.

02:08.629 --> 02:09.700
OH, WAS HE HANDSOME?

02:09.700 --> 02:11.662
NO. REALLY SHORT LEGS.
OH.

02:11.662 --> 02:13.404
POOR LITTLE FELLA WAS TOSSED
INTO A SECOND-STORY WINDOW.

02:13.404 --> 02:14.765
NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN.

02:14.765 --> 02:15.766
OH.

02:15.766 --> 02:16.907
YES! THEY LOVE EACH OTHER.

02:16.907 --> 02:19.310
WE--WE ARE GONNA HANG OUT
ALL THE TIME!

02:19.310 --> 02:23.143
BUDDY, I'M GONNA KISS
THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD.
(speaking indistinctly)

02:23.143 --> 02:25.646
(chuckles)
MWAH!

02:25.646 --> 02:27.147
GET USED TO IT.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.251
THESE IDIOTS ARE A SIX-PACK
SHORT OF RUNNING AWAY TOGETHER.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.252
HE IS MINE.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.454
MM-HMM.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.857
(singsongy)
UH-OH. MAKE-OUT PARTY.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.591
(glass clatters)

02:40.591 --> 02:42.293
(whispers) LET'S DO THIS.

02:45.496 --> 02:46.497
(gasps and gags)

02:46.497 --> 02:48.199
AY! SO...

02:48.199 --> 02:50.341
THERE'S SO MUCH BEAUTY
IN PHOTOGRAPHY.

02:50.341 --> 02:51.942
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE
THAT NOTION

02:51.942 --> 02:55.246
AND TURN IT ON ITS HEAD,
SO THE THEME OF MY WORK

02:55.246 --> 02:58.649
IS "TAKING THE BEAUTY OUT
OF BEAUTY."

02:58.649 --> 03:01.212
YOU REALLY CANNOT SEE
THE BEAUTY.

03:01.212 --> 03:02.413
THANK YOU.

03:02.413 --> 03:03.884
OUCH!
OHH. (wheezes)

03:03.884 --> 03:05.356
(mouths word)
(Laurie) OH, NO.

03:05.356 --> 03:08.819
WELL, I'M SURE THAT DEER WAS
VERY GRACEFUL WHEN IT HAD SKIN.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.862
OKAY, I LOVE THIS.
(glass clatters)

03:11.862 --> 03:14.365
I AM GONNA PUT THIS
ON MY WALL.

03:14.365 --> 03:15.696
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
HOLDING IT WRONG.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.867
IT'S A SEVERED TOE.

03:16.867 --> 03:18.198
(gasps)
OHH.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.199
OHH.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.371
WELL...
(pats leg)

03:20.371 --> 03:22.202
IT'S THE BEST PICTURE
OF A SEVERED TOE

03:22.202 --> 03:24.305
THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.

03:24.305 --> 03:27.478
YEAH. (strained voice)
I CAN'T STOP LOOKING AT IT.

03:29.580 --> 03:31.211
(sighs) OHH.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.214
UGH. I ALMOST BARFED.

03:34.214 --> 03:39.620
LUCKILY, I CAN CONTROL
MY GAG REFLEX.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.621
NOTHING?

03:40.621 --> 03:42.393
I DON'T SWING AT SOFTBALLS.

03:42.393 --> 03:43.454
PFFT.

03:43.454 --> 03:44.955
BUT TRAV'S PHOTOS WEREN'T
THAT BAD.

03:44.955 --> 03:47.358
TRUTH GUN!
WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK?

03:47.358 --> 03:49.229
IT WAS LIKE LOOKING
INTO AN OPEN WOUND,

03:49.229 --> 03:51.562
ESPECIALLY THE PHOTO
OF THE OPEN WOUND...

03:51.562 --> 03:52.563
EW.

03:52.563 --> 03:53.734
BUT MY MOM PHILOSOPHY
IS SIMPLE--

03:53.734 --> 03:57.268
ALWAYS SUPPORT YOUR CHILD,
NO MATTER WHAT.

03:57.268 --> 04:00.471
(grunts) WELL, I FINALLY GOT
THAT BROKEN DRAWER OPEN.

04:00.471 --> 04:02.613
I HAD TO PRY IT LOOSE
SO I CAN BABY-PROOF IT SHUT.

04:02.613 --> 04:05.576
(clank)
THAT DRAWER HAS BEEN JAMMED SHUT
FOR, LIKE, 15 YEARS.

04:05.576 --> 04:07.548
OH, CHECK IT OUT. (chuckles)
IT'S LIKE, UH...

04:09.320 --> 04:11.422
KOOSH BALL,
"BO KNOWS" T-SHIRT...

04:11.422 --> 04:12.423
OOH.

04:12.423 --> 04:14.285
(laughs)
THOSE OLD PORE STRIPS.

04:14.285 --> 04:15.926
REMEMBER THOSE THINGS
THAT GO OVER YOUR NOSE?

04:15.926 --> 04:18.429
(chuckles)
I'M GONNA TAKE 'EM.

04:18.429 --> 04:20.761
HEY! LOOK AT
THE CUTE, LITTLE ELEPHANT

04:20.761 --> 04:22.593
NAMED "BOB DOLE."

04:22.593 --> 04:25.265
OHH.
MY OLD FLEETWOOD MAC CASSETTE.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.339
YOU KNOW, FLEETWOOD MAC
MARRIED STEVIE NICKS.

04:28.339 --> 04:29.670
I DON'T THINK SO.

04:29.670 --> 04:30.671
WELL, IT'S TRUE.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.573
WHAT IS THIS?

04:32.573 --> 04:36.777
IT LOOKS LIKE
A SMOKE DETECTOR FROM A DISCO.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.880
THAT IS A SIMON.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.282
SORRY, JELLY BEAN.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.356
IT'S FOR AGES 8 AND UP,
NOT FOR YOU.

04:45.356 --> 04:47.688
OH, NO.
BOBBY CAN'T SEE THESE.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.059
I NEED SOME MATCHES.

04:49.059 --> 04:50.561
(thuds)

04:50.561 --> 04:51.822
DAMN IT.

04:51.822 --> 04:53.964
TALK ABOUT LUCKY!

04:53.964 --> 04:55.626
WALKING IN RIGHT AS JULES
WAS ABOUT TO BURN MY OLD...

04:55.626 --> 04:56.627
(high-pitched voice) ZUBAZ!

04:56.627 --> 04:58.369
(both laugh)

04:58.369 --> 05:00.971
YOU'VE GOT YOUR GREAT PANTS,
YOUR GREAT GIRL.

05:00.971 --> 05:02.403
WE HAD OUR FIRST
MAKE-OUT PARTY LAST NIGHT.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.404
OH.
(high-pitched voice) YEAH.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.405
COME ON.
(imitates explosion)

05:04.405 --> 05:05.406
(normal voice)
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.537
(whispers) YEAH.

05:06.537 --> 05:07.538
(normal voice) HOW ABOUT
A DOUBLE BELL KICK?

05:07.538 --> 05:09.340
YEAH.

05:09.340 --> 05:10.341
OOH.

05:10.341 --> 05:12.312
(both laugh)

05:12.312 --> 05:13.544
YOU KNOW, AFTER JULES,

05:13.544 --> 05:14.715
I DIDN'T THINK I'D EVER
BE ABLE TO COMMIT

05:14.715 --> 05:16.647
TO SOMEONE AGAIN,
BUT I'M FINALLY FEELING

05:16.647 --> 05:18.419
LIKE I'M READY
FOR SOMETHING REAL.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.990
I'M GLAD, BUDDY.
(pats back)

05:19.990 --> 05:23.824
I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING
TO MESS THINGS WITH ANGIE UP...

05:23.824 --> 05:25.426
BUT SHE MIGHT.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.429
DAMN YOU TO HELL!

05:31.402 --> 05:33.664
OHH. MMM!

05:33.664 --> 05:36.006
AM I TIRED... (yawns)

05:36.006 --> 05:38.939
OR IS IT
MY SEXY NEW BELLY CHAIN?

05:38.939 --> 05:41.972
(chuckles)
I LOVE MY '90s DRAWER.

05:41.972 --> 05:43.374
ME, TOO.

05:43.374 --> 05:44.745
THESE THINGS WERE A HUGE PART
OF MY FACE REGIMEN

05:44.745 --> 05:46.717
BACK WHEN I USED
TO MALE-MODEL.

05:46.717 --> 05:49.380
FIRST, SOAP AND WATER.
DUH. (chuckles)

05:49.380 --> 05:53.854
SECOND, MUD MASK.
THIRD... WAIT. NO TONER.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.526
(mouths word)
NO. YOU DON'T WANT TO DRY
THE INSTRUMENT.

05:55.526 --> 05:56.627
(door opens)

05:56.627 --> 05:58.659
AND THEN I HAD THESE THINGS
TO BRING ME HOME.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.830
(door closes)

05:59.830 --> 06:02.393
LADY BELLY CHAIN,
LORD NOSE STRIP.

06:02.393 --> 06:04.595
WELL, LET ME JUST SAY,
YOU'RE AN AMAZING MOTHER...

06:04.595 --> 06:06.066
OH! (chuckles)
AND--OH. (chuckles)

06:06.066 --> 06:07.798
I WASN'T DONE.
WHO'S STOPPING YOU?

06:07.798 --> 06:10.571
OKAY. YOU KNOW I WANT
TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER,

06:10.571 --> 06:13.944
AND I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THAT
MY FIRST PROFESSIONAL GIG

06:13.944 --> 06:17.448
WAS FOR YOU,
SO I WAS THINKING THAT

06:17.448 --> 06:19.379
I COULD TAKE THE PICTURES
AT YOUR WEDDING.

06:19.379 --> 06:23.113
OH. WOW. (chuckles)

06:23.113 --> 06:24.715
(mouths words)

06:26.417 --> 06:28.158
(chuckles)
WELL?

06:28.158 --> 06:30.791
WHAT AM I GONNA SAY, NO?

06:30.791 --> 06:32.392
OH, COOL!
(stomps foot)

06:32.392 --> 06:33.524
LOOK, I KNOW
IT'S A BIG DEAL FOR YOU,

06:33.524 --> 06:35.125
SO I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

06:35.125 --> 06:38.429
TAKE YOUR TIME. I'LL CHECK BACK.
(clicks teeth)

06:39.399 --> 06:40.400
(door opens)

06:40.400 --> 06:42.473
WELL-PLAYED.

06:42.473 --> 06:43.474
(door closes)
(clenches teeth) SHUT UP.

06:43.474 --> 06:46.577
OH! THAT'S JUST...

06:46.577 --> 06:48.078
OH, COME ON. YOU'RE NOT
EVEN GONNA LET ME SEE IT?

06:48.078 --> 06:50.180
THAT'S THE BEST PART.

06:53.644 --> 06:55.546
WEIRD.
I HAVE DISHES IN MY SINK,

06:55.546 --> 06:57.988
AND YOU HAVE CHICKEN BONES,
TISSUES,

06:57.988 --> 07:00.621
A PAIR OF BROKEN SUNGLASSES,
AND DIAPERS.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.622
(glasses clatter)
MM-HMM.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.954
GRAYSON BABY-PROOFED
MY TRASH CAN.

07:03.954 --> 07:05.195
I HAVE A HOUSE
FULL OF THINGS

07:05.195 --> 07:08.629
THAT I CAN'T OPEN,
INCLUDING MY TOILET.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.902
ELLIE, I HAD
TO TEE-TEE IN THE YARD.

07:11.902 --> 07:14.434
WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST GO
IN THE SHOWER?

07:14.434 --> 07:15.606
(singsongy) GROSS.

07:15.606 --> 07:16.937
(normal voice) BETWEEN THIS

07:16.937 --> 07:18.138
AND TRAVIS'S
WEDDING PHOTO STUFF,

07:18.138 --> 07:20.140
I-I'M GOING CRAZY.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.813
IF IT HELPS, GRAYSON SAID
HE'S FINE WITH TRAVIS DOING IT

07:22.813 --> 07:25.215
'CAUSE HE ALREADY HAS
GREAT WEDDING PICTURES.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.179
YOU HAVE A PICTURE UP
FROM YOUR FIRST WEDDING?

07:29.179 --> 07:32.452
YOU TOLD ME IT WAS
FROM A BUILDING DEDICATION.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.485
I SOMETIMES LIE
ABOUT THINGS.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.528
THIS IS GOING IN MY SINK.

07:37.528 --> 07:38.959
(sighs)
LOOK... (sighs)

07:38.959 --> 07:40.691
THIS IS PROBABLY
THE LAST TIME THAT

07:40.691 --> 07:43.664
I'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE
GREAT WEDDING PHOTOS...

07:43.664 --> 07:44.735
PROBABLY?

07:44.735 --> 07:46.096
(lowered voice)
BUT I WON'T GET THEM

07:46.096 --> 07:49.540
IF TRAVIS IS SPRAYING DOWN
MY BRIDAL PARTY WITH DOG BLOOD.

07:49.540 --> 07:51.902
TOO BAD YOU THINK
"A MOM SHOULD ALWAYS SUPPORT

07:51.902 --> 07:55.676
HER KID 100%, NO MATTER WHAT"--
DIRECT QUOTE.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.478
BURNED BY MY OWN
STUPID MOM PHILOSOPHY.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.180
YOU KNOW, AS A PARENT...

08:00.180 --> 08:02.052
"AS A PARENT"? (chuckles)

08:02.052 --> 08:05.686
YOU JUST FOUND OUT
YOU WERE A DAD 48 HOURS AGO.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.888
YEAH. CALM DOWN, DAY TWO.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.561
(chuckles) NOW, AS A PARENT
OF SEVERAL YEARS,

08:10.561 --> 08:11.562
WHAT I THINK--
WAIT. I-I--

08:11.562 --> 08:13.193
I'LL LET YOU FINISH
THAT THOUGHT

08:13.193 --> 08:16.026
IF YOU CAN TELL ME WHERE
YOUR CHILD IS RIGHT NOW.

08:16.026 --> 08:17.528
I'M OUT.

08:17.528 --> 08:20.230
I KNOW THAT TRAVIS' WORK
IS A LITTLE HORRIFYING,

08:20.230 --> 08:22.172
BUT HE DOES HAVE TALENT.

08:22.172 --> 08:24.905
I MEAN, I THINK.
MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.506
WELL, I NEED TO FIND OUT
IF HE CAN DO IT.

08:29.780 --> 08:32.512
(chuckles) IS THIS
FROM YOUR HONEYMOON?

08:32.512 --> 08:36.116
THAT IS ME AND MY COUSIN.
(chuckles)

08:36.116 --> 08:37.117
SINK.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.518
MM-HMM.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.620
WHAT THE FUDGE NUTS
WERE YOU DOING

08:39.620 --> 08:40.691
MACKING WITH THAT DUDE?

08:40.691 --> 08:42.092
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET, BUT...

08:42.092 --> 08:43.093
(thud)
OW!

08:43.093 --> 08:44.755
STOMPING ON MY FOOT?

08:44.755 --> 08:48.599
THAT WAS ME.
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO US?!

08:48.599 --> 08:49.660
WE'VE ONLY BEEN DATING
A FEW WEEKS.

08:49.660 --> 08:52.232
YOU NEVER SAID THAT
YOU WANTED TO BE EXCLUSIVE.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.764
YES, I DID.

08:53.764 --> 08:55.165
EVERY TIME I KISSED YOU,
MY LIPS WERE SAYING...

08:55.165 --> 08:59.309
(muffled) "ANGIE... I...
WANT... TO... BE... EXCLUSIVE."

08:59.309 --> 09:02.172
WHY DO YOUR LIPS NEED
YOUR FINGERS TO MAKE THEM TALK?

09:02.172 --> 09:03.173
I DON'T KNOW.

09:03.173 --> 09:04.575
(thud)
OW!

09:04.575 --> 09:05.676
OKAY. YOU NEED TO STOP.

09:05.676 --> 09:06.847
I'M VERY HOT.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.048
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE FIVE?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.921
в™Єв™Єв™Є

09:10.921 --> 09:13.253
I THOUGHT
WE HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.286
I WAS WRONG. WE'RE THROUGH.

09:17.688 --> 09:19.289
I'D BE STORMING OUT
RIGHT NOW

09:19.289 --> 09:21.592
IF I HADN'T JUST ORDERED
A CHEESEBURGER.

09:21.592 --> 09:23.333
OOH. CHEESEBURGER.

09:24.935 --> 09:26.897
(door closes)

09:26.897 --> 09:28.939
HEY, JELLY BEAN.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

09:28.939 --> 09:29.940
OF COURSE YOU ARE...

09:29.940 --> 09:31.772
(singsongy)
BECAUSE I'M AWESOME.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.103
PLEASE TRY SIMON.

09:33.103 --> 09:35.105
I WANT TO SEE
IF A JELLY BEAN CAN DO IT.

09:35.105 --> 09:36.647
JULES TOLD ME NEVER TO ASK,

09:36.647 --> 09:39.850
BUT WHY DO YOU CALL ME
"JELLY BEAN"?

09:39.850 --> 09:43.283
WELL, J.B.,
WHEN JULES FIRST HIRED YOU,

09:43.283 --> 09:45.285
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SO SIMPLEMINDED,

09:45.285 --> 09:47.157
SHE COULD CONVINCE YOU

09:47.157 --> 09:50.190
THAT JELLY BEANS WERE
MORE VALUABLE THAN GOLD

09:50.190 --> 09:52.863
AND SUBSEQUENTLY PAY YOU
IN JELLY BEANS.

09:52.863 --> 09:56.196
THIS CONCEPT WAS EVENTUALLY
SHORTENED INTO YOUR NICKNAME...

09:56.196 --> 09:57.597
(whispers) "JELLY BEAN."

09:57.597 --> 09:59.129
NOT AS DUMB AS YOU THINK.

09:59.129 --> 10:02.102
WE'LL SEE. SIMON, GET HER.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.273
(switch clicks)

10:03.273 --> 10:06.907
I'M NOT GONNA PLAY
YOUR STUPID GAME, ELLIE.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.979
(beeps once)

10:08.979 --> 10:10.641
(beeps once)

10:10.641 --> 10:11.642
(chuckles)

10:11.642 --> 10:12.913
(beeps twice)

10:14.014 --> 10:15.686
(beeps twice)

10:15.686 --> 10:16.687
(grunts)

10:16.687 --> 10:18.649
(beeps three times)

10:18.649 --> 10:19.650
WAIT A MINUTE.

10:19.650 --> 10:20.821
WAIT FOR IT...

10:20.821 --> 10:23.223
(beeps twice and buzzes)

10:23.223 --> 10:25.325
(Laurie) DAMN IT!

10:27.127 --> 10:29.730
THIS SUCKS.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.861
NOW I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW YOU FELT

10:30.861 --> 10:33.003
WHEN I CHEATED ON YOU
ALL THOSE TIMES.

10:33.003 --> 10:35.335
IT FEELS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
(chuckles)

10:35.335 --> 10:37.367
I MEAN, SHE'S BEEN
YOUR GIRLFRIEND FOR TWO WEEKS,

10:37.367 --> 10:39.870
AND SHE KISSED A DUDE,
AND, WELL, WE WERE MARRIED,

10:39.870 --> 10:42.642
AND YOU BANGED
A THOUSAND WAITRESSES.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.314
IS IT THE WAITRESS PART
THAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT?

10:44.314 --> 10:47.317
SURE. WHY NOT?

10:47.317 --> 10:50.150
MAN, I NEVER WANT TO SEE
ANGIE'S FACE AGAIN.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.123
HOW STRICT ARE YOU
ON THE WHOLE "NEVER" THING?

10:54.224 --> 10:55.425
MM.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.988
OHH.

10:57.988 --> 10:59.389
SO WHY'D YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME?

10:59.389 --> 11:01.391
WHAT?! YOU ASKED HER
TO COME HERE?

11:01.391 --> 11:04.364
SHE'S TRAV'S TEACHER,
AND--AND I NEED TO KNOW,

11:04.364 --> 11:05.866
IS HE TALENTED?

11:05.866 --> 11:07.037
WELL--
LIAR!

11:07.037 --> 11:08.268
BOBBY.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.770
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS HAND DOES NOT GET

11:09.770 --> 11:11.371
TO TOUCH THIS KNEE ANYMORE.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.744
YEAH. I'M GONNA PASS
ON THE HAND, TOO,

11:13.744 --> 11:14.945
BECAUSE, WELL,
NOTHING PERSONAL.

11:14.945 --> 11:15.976
IT'S JUST THAT
WE HAVEN'T BEEN FRIENDS

11:15.976 --> 11:17.007
FOR THAT LONG. (chuckles)

11:17.007 --> 11:20.050
LOOK, TRAV IS SUPER TALENTED.

11:20.050 --> 11:21.411
REALLY?
YEAH.

11:21.411 --> 11:24.214
COULD HE TAKE
GREAT WEDDING PHOTOS?
TOTALLY.

11:24.214 --> 11:26.787
SO THIS COULD BE HIS CAREER?
ABSOLUTELY.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.720
MY BOY IS GONNA BE HAPPY
DOING SOMETHING HE LOVES!

11:29.720 --> 11:31.762
OH, NO.
HE'S NOT GONNA BE HAPPY.

11:31.762 --> 11:33.063
THERE'S, LIKE,
FOUR PHOTOGRAPHERS

11:33.063 --> 11:35.265
IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO ACTUALLY
MAKE A LIVING AT THIS.

11:35.265 --> 11:37.397
WHY DO YOU THINK I TOOK
A TEACHING JOB?

11:37.397 --> 11:40.100
MM. EVEN THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
I STILL HAVE TO CASH

11:40.100 --> 11:42.973
MY DEAD COUSIN'S
SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS.

11:42.973 --> 11:46.106
OOH! SWEET.
IS THIS ANYONE'S NICKEL?

11:46.106 --> 11:47.307
WOW.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.439
I TOLD YOU SHE WAS A BITCH.

11:49.439 --> 11:52.943
(beeps)

11:52.943 --> 11:54.244
(buzzes)

11:54.244 --> 11:56.046
WHY DO I SUCK AT THIS?

11:56.046 --> 11:58.418
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
WHEN YOU WERE A FETUS...
(beeping continues)

11:58.418 --> 12:02.222
YOUR MOM EXISTED ON FUNNEL CAKES
AND MOTORCYCLE FUMES.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.855
CONSIDER IT A VICTORY
YOU DON'T HAVE A TAIL.

12:04.855 --> 12:07.397
(buzzes)
UGH! STOP TALKING TO ME.

12:07.397 --> 12:09.029
I NEED TO FOCUS.
(beeping resumes)

12:09.029 --> 12:10.200
(high-pitched voice)
OH, LOOK.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.062
(jangles)
(singsongy)
SOMETHING SHINY.

12:12.062 --> 12:13.463
(buzzes)

12:13.463 --> 12:16.466
AAH! SHUT UP, SIMON.

12:16.466 --> 12:17.467
I'M NOT DUMB!

12:17.467 --> 12:19.309
(thuds, buzzes)

12:19.309 --> 12:23.513
(baby voice)
SOUNDS LIKE SIMON DISAGREES.

12:23.513 --> 12:26.476
(door squeaks)

12:26.476 --> 12:27.477
(door closes)
HEY.

12:27.477 --> 12:29.449
ANGIE,
HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.381
YOUR DOOR IS HELD SHUT
WITH SUSPENDERS.

12:31.381 --> 12:33.884
WHEN I CAME IN, I FOUND
A BUM MAKING A SANDWICH.

12:33.884 --> 12:36.156
OH, THAT'S JUST GARY.
(sighs)

12:36.156 --> 12:37.487
OR DENNIS.

12:37.487 --> 12:40.030
DID HE HAVE A BEARD
OR A HUGE BEARD?

12:40.030 --> 12:41.832
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS SCREAMING.

12:41.832 --> 12:43.033
OH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE GARY.

12:43.033 --> 12:44.064
OH.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.095
BE HONEST.

12:45.095 --> 12:47.137
NOW YOU KNEW HOW CRAZY
I WAS ABOUT YOU,

12:47.137 --> 12:48.839
BUT YOU WENT AHEAD
AND KISSED THAT GUY ANYWAY,

12:48.839 --> 12:50.000
NOW DIDN'T YOU?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.271
YEAH.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.943
(sighs) YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO NOW.

12:52.943 --> 12:54.444
I'M NAKED UNDER HERE.

12:54.444 --> 12:56.006
LET'S DO THIS.

12:57.507 --> 13:01.111
BUT WHY DOES TRAVIS EVEN WANT
TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER?

13:01.111 --> 13:02.782
YOU KNOW, I WANTED HIM TO BE
ONE OF THOSE SCIENTISTS

13:02.782 --> 13:06.086
THAT INVENT STEM CELLS
SO I COULD LIVE FOREVER.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.358
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DIE.
(sighs)

13:08.358 --> 13:11.491
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
40 MORE YEARS, TOPS.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.793
DID YOU HEAR HER?
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TIME.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.565
SHH. IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

13:15.565 --> 13:17.367
(camera shutter clicks)

13:17.367 --> 13:19.799
THOUGHT I'D START
TAKING PICS NOW.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.832
I EVEN GOT
A FEW OF YOU NAPPING.

13:21.832 --> 13:25.035
GRAYSON, DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE THE LITTLE SPOON.

13:25.035 --> 13:27.307
IT MAKES ME FEEL SAFE.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.538
I JUST--I CANNOT STAND

13:28.538 --> 13:30.881
THE THOUGHT OF HIM HAVING
A CRAPPY LIFE.

13:30.881 --> 13:32.542
I MEAN, WHY COULDN'T HE BE
A DRUG DEALER?

13:32.542 --> 13:34.444
AT LEAST THEY HAVE COOL CARS.

13:34.444 --> 13:36.887
I'VE FOUND THAT WITH JILL--
(both) TAMPA.

13:36.887 --> 13:40.290
STOP IT. I'VE FOUND THAT
PARENTING IS MORE ABOUT HONESTY.

13:40.290 --> 13:41.591
I WARNED YOU, DAY TWO.

13:41.591 --> 13:45.355
BA-HA. YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS
ABOUT TRAVIS' BLEAK FUTURE?

13:45.355 --> 13:49.359
THERE IS NO CHANCE NOW HE'LL
PURSUE ANYTHING BUT PHOTOGRAPHY

13:49.359 --> 13:54.204
NOW THAT HIS MOM HAS GIVEN HIM
HIS FIRST BIG, SUPPORTIVE PUSH.

13:54.204 --> 13:56.066
(camera shutter clicks)

13:56.066 --> 13:58.308
HONEY, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

13:58.308 --> 14:00.610
I DON'T WANT YOU TO
HAVE TO WORK AT MY WEDDING.

14:00.610 --> 14:02.542
I WANT YOU TO HAVE FUN.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.945
SO YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO TAKE YOUR PICTURES?

14:04.945 --> 14:07.047
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T THINK
YOU WOULD BE GOOD, BECAUSE--

14:07.047 --> 14:10.220
IT'S FINE. I MEAN,
IT'S YOUR WEDDING. (chuckles)

14:15.155 --> 14:16.586
I'VE FOUND THAT WITH KIDS...

14:16.586 --> 14:17.888
(door slams)

14:17.888 --> 14:19.629
NOTHING.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.495
OH.
(rattles)

14:25.495 --> 14:26.937
UGH!

14:26.937 --> 14:29.439
DAMN IT, DAY TWO.
JUST OPEN IT FOR ME.

14:29.439 --> 14:32.272
I'LL OPEN IT IF YOU STOP
CALLING ME "DAY TWO."

14:32.272 --> 14:33.373
THEN WE'RE AT AN IMPASSE.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.306
HEY, SWEETIE. YOU WANT
A FINGER FULL OF YOGURT?

14:36.306 --> 14:37.307
(sighs)

14:37.307 --> 14:38.608
SURE.

14:40.150 --> 14:43.083
THERE.
THAT FIXES EVERYTHING.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.056
WOW.
HE'S REALLY ANGRY WITH US.

14:46.056 --> 14:48.258
"US"?
YEAH.

14:48.258 --> 14:50.390
(door closes)
YOU TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS
MY DECISION, DIDN'T YOU?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.892
AND HE'S STILL MAD AT ME.
THAT'S CRAZY.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.525
YOU KNOW WHOSE FAULT
THIS REALLY IS?
YOURS?

14:55.525 --> 14:56.997
(mouth full)
STOP IT. WE'RE OFF THAT.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.198
(normal voice)
NO, IT'S ANGIE'S.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.499
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO PUSHED HIM

14:59.499 --> 15:01.231
INTO HAVING A CAREER
IN PHOTOGRAPHY.

15:01.231 --> 15:02.602
ALMOST MAKES SENSE.

15:02.602 --> 15:05.905
I'M GONNA CALL HER.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.138
(cell phone beeps)
DID YOU PHOTOSHOP MY FACE
IN THIS PICTURE?

15:08.138 --> 15:09.139
YEP.

15:09.139 --> 15:10.480
I LIKE IT.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.315
HEY, ANDY.

15:17.547 --> 15:19.349
(door squeaks)

15:19.349 --> 15:22.022
DUDE, I JUST PASSED ANGIE...

15:22.022 --> 15:24.554
WHO LOOKED
RECENTLY MADE LOVE TO.

15:24.554 --> 15:25.925
YEAH!

15:25.925 --> 15:27.427
BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

15:28.498 --> 15:30.700
(sighs) SO SHE FOUND
YOUR WEAK SPOT?

15:30.700 --> 15:32.562
IF THAT MEANS MY DING DONG,
THEN YEAH.

15:32.562 --> 15:34.534
MAYBE I'M NOT THE KIND OF GUY
WHO GETS TO HAVE

15:34.534 --> 15:36.166
A REAL RELATIONSHIP,
YOU KNOW?

15:36.166 --> 15:39.069
YOU'RE WRONG. DON'T SETTLE
FOR LESS THAN YOU DESERVE.

15:39.069 --> 15:40.270
(door squeaks open)

15:40.270 --> 15:44.374
HEY, WE'RE BUSY HERE, GARY.

15:44.374 --> 15:46.216
(door closes)
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DENNIS.

15:46.216 --> 15:49.119
(beeps)

15:49.119 --> 15:50.580
(buzzes)

15:50.580 --> 15:52.382
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!

15:52.382 --> 15:54.184
OH, REALLY?

15:54.184 --> 15:57.357
(beeping)

15:58.628 --> 16:00.960
OH, EYES SHUT.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.961
WELL--

16:01.961 --> 16:03.493
OH. BROKE MY PERSONAL RECORD.

16:03.493 --> 16:05.435
VICTORY SIP.

16:05.435 --> 16:07.537
MM. MM.

16:07.537 --> 16:10.270
DONE. DON'T BE SAD.
(rapid beeping)

16:10.270 --> 16:12.672
I HEAR THEY'RE COMING OUT
WITH A JELLY BEAN VERSION.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.375
IT'S JUST ONE BIG BUTTON.

16:15.375 --> 16:19.179
USUALLY, I DON'T MIND
TAKING YOUR CRAP.

16:19.179 --> 16:22.352
YOU CALL ME A SLUT--
I SAY IT'S A LIFESTYLE CHOICE.

16:22.352 --> 16:25.055
YOU SAY I'M UNCOUTH--NO BIGGIE--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

16:25.055 --> 16:27.517
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS
CALLING ME DUMB, BUT...

16:27.517 --> 16:29.619
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT
YOU MEANT IT.

16:29.619 --> 16:32.122
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M DUMB?

16:32.122 --> 16:34.564
IT WOULD BE EASIER
TO JUST SAY "NO."

16:36.696 --> 16:37.697
MM!

16:37.697 --> 16:40.400
YOU CAN DO IT.
JUST SQUEEZE AND PULL.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.401
(clank)
OH!

16:41.401 --> 16:44.174
(sighs) I DID IT. WOW.

16:44.174 --> 16:46.376
HERE.

16:46.376 --> 16:47.577
DID YOU REALLY
ASK ME OVER HERE

16:47.577 --> 16:49.309
JUST TO SHOW YOU
HOW TO OPEN A CABINET?

16:49.309 --> 16:51.511
NO, BUT THAT'S TOTALLY
SOMETHING I WOULD DO.
(glasses clinking)

16:51.511 --> 16:53.583
NO, I'M--I'M MAD AT YOU.

16:53.583 --> 16:56.616
WHY WOULD YOU PUSH TRAVIS
INTO A CAREER THAT ENDS WITH HIM

16:56.616 --> 16:58.718
BEING BROKE LIKE HIS DAD,
LIVING ON A BOAT

16:58.718 --> 17:02.092
AND HAVING HIS HEART BROKEN
BY SOME CHEATING SKANK?

17:02.092 --> 17:03.453
BOBBY AND I
ARE BACK TOGETHER.

17:03.453 --> 17:04.654
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED YOU.

17:04.654 --> 17:05.795
THANK YOU.

17:05.795 --> 17:07.327
LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU'VE
BEEN WORRYING ABOUT TRAVIS,

17:07.327 --> 17:10.700
SO I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING
THAT HE LEFT IN THE DARKROOM.

17:12.562 --> 17:13.803
WOW.

17:13.803 --> 17:16.536
IT SMELLS LIKE DEAD ANIMALS
IN HERE.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.168
I GOTTA EMPTY
THE TRASH SINK.

17:18.168 --> 17:21.671
LOOK... (sighs) TRAV CHOSE
THIS PATH BECAUSE HE LOVES IT.

17:21.671 --> 17:24.544
THERE'S NOTHING ANYONE CAN SAY
THAT'S GONNA STOP HIM,

17:24.544 --> 17:26.376
SO ALL YOU CAN DO

17:26.376 --> 17:28.718
IS DECIDE IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
THERE FOR HIM ALONG THE WAY.

17:30.580 --> 17:31.581
LAURIE.

17:31.581 --> 17:32.582
(clatter)

17:32.582 --> 17:34.154
DO THIS MATH PROBLEM.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.355
(grunts)

17:36.726 --> 17:38.258
IS THAT RIGHT?

17:38.258 --> 17:40.630
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T DO MATH.

17:40.630 --> 17:42.362
I CAN DO BASIC MATH.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.364
LIKE, IF THE NANNY
BREAKS A GLASS,

17:44.364 --> 17:47.097
THAT'S MINUS $7
FROM HER PAYCHECK.

17:47.097 --> 17:51.541
EVERYONE HAS SOMETHING
THAT MAKES THEM FEEL DUMB.

17:51.541 --> 17:54.104
FOR JULES,
IT'S THE BABY-PROOFING.

17:54.104 --> 17:57.677
BOBBY--
IT'S THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

17:57.677 --> 17:58.748
GRAYSON...

17:58.748 --> 18:01.080
A BEER, TWO MARTINIS,
AND SOME WINGS.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.452
GOT IT.

18:02.452 --> 18:04.554
HOLD ON--UH--WHAT?

18:04.554 --> 18:07.757
THAT GUY OWNS A BAR
AND CAN'T REMEMBER AN ORDER.

18:07.757 --> 18:09.689
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE DUMB.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.522
I JUST THINK YOU HAVE
A BLIND SPOT FOR SIMON.

18:12.522 --> 18:15.525
SIMON
AND AIRPORT BAGGAGE CAROUSELS.

18:15.525 --> 18:17.767
EVERYONE ELSE JUST
TAKES THEIR LUGGAGE SO EASY.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.599
I END UP RUNNING LAPS.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.271
WELL, YOU HAVE TO
WAIT FOR IT.

18:21.271 --> 18:25.835
SO NOBODY ORDERED
MOZZARELLA STICKS? REALLY?

18:27.677 --> 18:29.579
(footsteps approach)
HEY.

18:29.579 --> 18:33.313
SO, UH... REMEMBER
THAT FANTASY YOU TALKED ABOUT?

18:34.484 --> 18:35.685
KAPOW.

18:35.685 --> 18:38.248
WHOO! THAT'S HOT.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.252
NOW WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
HOLD ON.

18:42.252 --> 18:44.254
IS THERE EVEN A CHANCE

18:44.254 --> 18:46.296
THAT YOU AND I CAN
TURN INTO SOMETHING REAL?

18:46.296 --> 18:49.799
THAT'S NOT WHERE I AM
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

18:49.799 --> 18:52.732
TODAY I'M TEACHING HERE,
BUT NEXT WEEK I MAY JUST...

18:52.732 --> 18:55.335
RUN OFF TO KENYA
TO SHOOT ELEPHANTS.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.537
SO...

18:57.537 --> 18:59.669
FOR NOW I JUST WANT
SOMETHING FUN.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.675
IT IS FUN...

19:05.675 --> 19:08.648
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
FOR ME. (sighs)

19:08.648 --> 19:10.780
ARE YOU SURE? I MEAN...

19:10.780 --> 19:14.784
(singsongy) I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ON UNDER MY ZUBAZ.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.528
(sighs) BYE, ANGIE.

19:18.528 --> 19:20.630
BYE.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.166
HEY, WHEN YOU SAY
SHOOT ELEPHANTS...

19:27.166 --> 19:29.699
OH--WITH A CAMERA. YEAH.

19:29.699 --> 19:31.201
COOL.

19:31.201 --> 19:34.204
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:36.746 --> 19:37.947
HEY.

19:37.947 --> 19:39.749
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

19:39.749 --> 19:42.752
I HAVE THREE MIDTERMS NEXT WEEK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M UP TO?

19:42.752 --> 19:44.684
SOME...
NERDY COMPUTER THING?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.316
CORRECT.

19:46.316 --> 19:49.719
SOMETIMES WHEN I'M STRESSED OUT,
I LIKE TO PUNCH SHARKS.

19:49.719 --> 19:51.661
(inhales sharply)

19:51.661 --> 19:52.762
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:52.762 --> 19:54.564
WHY ARE YOU
HOLDING YOUR BREATH?

19:54.564 --> 19:55.825
(strained voice)
BECAUSE I'M UNDERWATER.

19:55.825 --> 19:57.467
WHY AREN'T
YOUR CLOTHES WET?

19:57.467 --> 19:59.769
(normal voice) OH, GOD.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RUINING IT.

19:59.769 --> 20:01.301
SORRY.
(beep)

20:01.301 --> 20:03.873
IF I ASKED NICELY,

20:03.873 --> 20:06.436
WILL YOU TAKE PICTURES
AT MY WEDDING?

20:06.436 --> 20:08.708
AW, WHAT A NICE
GUILTY GESTURE.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.909
KINDA.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.782
SO ARE YOU IN OR OUT?
IN.

20:12.782 --> 20:15.845
GOOD... BECAUSE YOU ARE
AN AMAZING PHOTOGRAPHER,

20:15.845 --> 20:18.818
AND I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
SAID "NO" IN THE FIRST PLACE.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.850
I WANT YOU
TO HAVE A GREAT LIFE,

20:20.850 --> 20:22.552
AND THE THOUGHT
OF YOU STRUGGLING--

20:22.552 --> 20:25.895
IT JUST--IT SCARES ME.
I-I-I FREAKED OUT.

20:25.895 --> 20:27.827
I'M OKAY WITH THE STRUGGLE.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.529
OKAY, GOOD.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.362
BECAUSE IT'S GOT TO BE
YOUR STRUGGLE, NOT MINE.

20:32.362 --> 20:35.265
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU MONEY
WHENEVER YOU NEED IT.

20:35.265 --> 20:36.766
YES, YOU WILL.
YEAH, I WILL.

20:36.766 --> 20:38.408
WE SHOULD PROBABLY OPEN
A JOINT BANK ACCOUNT.

20:38.408 --> 20:39.869
(chuckles)

20:39.869 --> 20:42.942
JUST PROMISE ME THAT
LIFE'S GONNA WORK OUT FOR YOU.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.645
I PROMISE.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.447
YOU STILL LOOK WORRIED.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.978
DO YOU WANT TO
FIGHT SOME SHARKS?

20:50.620 --> 20:52.382
BWAH! (chuckles)

20:52.382 --> 20:53.683
YOU KNOW,
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE

20:53.683 --> 20:55.885
TO SWING A TENNIS RACKET
IN WATER.

20:55.885 --> 20:57.757
(grunts)
YEAH, WELL, YOU'D BE WET.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.929
MM--BWAH!

21:03.933 --> 21:07.597
I DON'T KNOW IF I LIKE THIS.
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING AT US.

21:07.597 --> 21:09.539
THAT'S BECAUSE
WE LOOK AWESOME.

21:09.539 --> 21:11.701
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS HAPPENING.

21:11.701 --> 21:13.843
HA. COME ON, G-MAN.
WE'RE DOING THIS, BABY.

21:13.843 --> 21:15.605
WE'RE DOING THIS NOW.

21:15.605 --> 21:17.477
THEN WHY ARE WE
STILL ON THE GROUND?

21:17.477 --> 21:18.878
GENTLEMEN...

21:18.878 --> 21:20.710
I'LL SEE YOU
ON TOP OF THE WORLD.
