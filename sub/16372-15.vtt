00:05.600 --> 00:07.114
Raymond.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.110
Are you sure about this?

00:10.640 --> 00:14.031
Bringing them all together
in one location...

00:14.240 --> 00:16.311
...it's dangerous.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.351
One of our most trusted
confidants intends...

00:23.520 --> 00:27.070
...to do irrevocable damage
to the organization.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.960
It needs to be confronted swiftly.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.156
It's dangerous.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.793
There's a traitor in the family.
I intend to find them.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.270
And if something goes wrong?

00:45.720 --> 00:48.838
Hold on. Hold on. No, just hold on.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.912
- Where am I?
- Keep breathing. Keep...

00:51.080 --> 00:52.480
Slow. Good.

00:52.920 --> 00:53.956
What's going on?

00:54.120 --> 00:56.396
Mr. Reddington,
my name is Dr. Haverkamp.

00:56.560 --> 00:59.280
I'm an on-call specialist
on your Code 77 team...

00:59.440 --> 01:02.638
...and you had an emergency.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.032
- Why can't I breathe?
- Give the medication a minute.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.236
Just give it a minute.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.518
I need you to listen.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.070
Do you know where you are?

01:15.480 --> 01:17.517
What do you remember?

01:17.720 --> 01:20.030
There... Restaurant.

01:21.560 --> 01:24.120
- What's wrong with me?
- We're not quite sure.

01:24.280 --> 01:27.671
We thought, at first, you may have had
a series of ministrokes...

01:27.840 --> 01:30.833
...but the MRis, the EEGs,
they rule that out.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.311
- Where's Dembe? Dembe will know.
- I don't know who that is...

01:34.480 --> 01:37.552
...but the man who drove you here left
as soon as you stabilized.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.870
I don't remember.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.596
Mr. Reddington,
I was told that you insist...

01:42.760 --> 01:46.151
...on a frank, unvarnished assessment...

01:46.320 --> 01:48.994
...of the situation, so...

01:49.160 --> 01:50.310
...here it is:

01:50.480 --> 01:52.836
You're dying.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.434
- How?
- We believe you've been poisoned.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.114
We're not sure how...

02:00.280 --> 02:02.590
...but your symptoms are severe
and progressing...

02:02.760 --> 02:03.910
...at an alarming rate.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.391
The cocktail of steroids will stave off
the symptoms for a short time...

02:07.600 --> 02:10.513
...but unless we know
how you were poisoned...

02:10.680 --> 02:13.400
- How long can you keep me alive?
- It's hard to say.

02:14.440 --> 02:17.592
A day, maybe two.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.355
What? No, no, no. What are you doing?

02:20.840 --> 02:23.116
Your cell phone.
Do you have a cell phone?

02:23.280 --> 02:26.114
Please, Mr. Reddington,
you need medical attention.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.999
Your condition is critical.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.514
Where are you going?

02:29.680 --> 02:31.034
Elizabeth.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.396
Gather the task force.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.472
I need your help...

02:35.640 --> 02:37.313
...to solve a murder.

02:51.760 --> 02:52.989
What's going on?

02:53.440 --> 02:56.319
Your prayers have been answered,
Donald.

02:58.520 --> 02:59.840
Apparently I'm dying.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.151
Aram, could you get him a chair, please?

03:02.320 --> 03:03.834
No, no, no, I'm fine.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.514
- I've been poisoned.
- Poisoned?

03:05.920 --> 03:09.311
- By whom?
- Someone within my organization.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.040
Someone with access
to an offshore account...

03:12.200 --> 03:15.637
...that was used to fund
recent attacks against me.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.232
Eleven people had access
to that account.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.236
Last evening, I called those 11
to a dinner to confront them.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.880
What happened next...

03:27.200 --> 03:29.157
...I only remember pieces.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.279
The restaurant, what it looked like,
not where it was.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.279
I remember holding a glass of wine,
but not drinking it...

03:35.480 --> 03:37.437
- ...but I'm sure I must have.
- The poison...

03:37.600 --> 03:39.080
- Where's Dembe?
- Missing.

03:39.640 --> 03:44.590
I assume searching for or in the hands
of the person who wants me dead.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.798
- You should be with your doctors.
- They can't identify the toxin.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.792
- A hospital, then.
- I'm told I have a day.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.037
- Two at most.
- No.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.317
That... That can't be true.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.359
I need you to find
the pharmaco-toxicologist...

03:57.520 --> 04:01.639
...who I believe crafted the deadly
cocktail and get the antidote from him.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.911
- What do you know about him?
- Well...

04:05.720 --> 04:08.360
There's a man.
He told me he's known as...

04:08.560 --> 04:10.199
The Apothecary.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.920
<i>A druggist whose potions hijack
the immune system...</i>

04:13.520 --> 04:16.478
...causing any number
of allergic reactions...

04:16.640 --> 04:20.873
<i>...each one impossible to identify
unless you know what to look for.</i>

04:21.040 --> 04:24.511
<i>An exotic venom might replicate
a drug overdose.</i>

04:24.680 --> 04:29.675
A personally-tailored allergic reaction
might trigger cardiovascular collapse.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.196
<i>The Apothecary can create embolisms...</i>

04:32.360 --> 04:34.079
<i>...aneurysms...</i>

04:34.240 --> 04:36.800
<i>...inhibit respiration, induce paralysis.</i>

04:37.000 --> 04:39.959
All of the assassins you know about...

04:40.120 --> 04:42.476
...share one common disadvantage...

04:42.640 --> 04:44.711
...when it comes
to avoiding apprehension:

04:44.880 --> 04:46.758
They leave behind a corpse.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.755
And yet, there are times
when a prolonged coma...

04:50.920 --> 04:53.913
...or a protracted illness...

04:54.760 --> 04:56.558
...will get the job done just as well.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.872
So, this Apothecary, how do we find him?
Find the antidote?

05:00.040 --> 05:01.156
Ilario Panetti.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.990
- The head of the Panetti syndicate.
- He's about to go up on RICO charges.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.192
The government's star witness
against him...

05:07.360 --> 05:10.194
...has rather conveniently fallen
into a coma.

05:10.600 --> 05:14.071
I believe Panetti has availed himself
of the Apothecary's services.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.950
Be quick. I don't have the luxury of time.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.634
Hold on. Where are you going?

05:19.840 --> 05:21.877
To find Dembe.

05:22.040 --> 05:26.956
While you try to save my life,
I'll spend what time I have saving his.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.313
<i>Let me tell you about Ilario Panetti.</i>

05:29.480 --> 05:31.711
He takes organized crime
to a whole new level.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.834
Everything he does
is meticulously planned.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.879
I've never seen anybody more cautious
in avoiding surveillance.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.839
- It must've been hard to make a case.
- Almost impossible.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.390
From the outside,
he looks completely legit.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.394
But you don't get a stranglehold
on commercial construction...

05:46.560 --> 05:48.995
...in this city without strangling
a few enemies.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.112
- I just couldn't prove it.
- What happened?

05:51.280 --> 05:52.475
He got greedy.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.155
His largest competitor got firebombed...

05:55.320 --> 05:57.118
...their offices completely destroyed.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.749
Two days later Panetti paid 200 grand
to an associate...

05:59.960 --> 06:02.111
We don't know who.
...for services rendered.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.509
Competition over.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.751
- How do you know?
- We flipped his accountant.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.918
A woman named Helen Dahle.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.914
She cut the check,
and she was prepared to testify...

06:11.080 --> 06:13.231
...Panetti ordered her
to pay for the arson.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.392
A few days before trial,
she goes to dinner.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.434
Has a mysterious allergic reaction
to the food, and wham.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.512
She's on life support
and so is my case.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.717
We think we know how Panetti got to her.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.872
Fantastic. How do I help?

06:25.040 --> 06:28.431
We need you to put us in touch
with Helen Dahle's doctors.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.319
<i>Eleven people had access
to that account.</i>

06:32.480 --> 06:33.834
<i>I don't know where they are.</i>

06:35.360 --> 06:38.751
Hideki, where the hell are you?
I need to speak with you right away.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.599
Call me as soon as you possibly can.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.639
He never showed up?
Can you...? Can you reach him?

06:43.840 --> 06:46.560
No, no, put Sidney on the line.
Do you know where he went?

06:46.760 --> 06:49.070
Yes, yes, yes, as soon as you hear.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.431
Don't worry, sweetheart. It'll be okay.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.876
I won't ever give up on you.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.157
I promise.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.676
It'll be just fine.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.116
Doctor.

08:21.520 --> 08:22.920
What are you doing here?

08:23.080 --> 08:25.390
The night I was poisoned...

08:25.560 --> 08:27.836
- I can't remember...
- People will see you.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.116
Us. Together.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.760
I was promised discretion.

08:36.520 --> 08:39.159
My help was to be
in the strictest confidence.

08:39.320 --> 08:42.073
The night I was poisoned,
I was with people.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.756
I don't know where they are. I've
called, I can't reach them, except you.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.474
I don't know anything.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.632
You know how I was brought in?

08:49.840 --> 08:51.559
I got a code text.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.036
I was given a location.
We gathered, prepped.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.271
How about the man who brought me in?

08:56.440 --> 08:58.636
- Well, I didn't get his name...
- Black.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.757
African accent.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.276
- You need to be hospitalized.
- Was it him?

09:03.480 --> 09:05.949
Yes, I believe it was.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.396
- How did we get there?
- He drove you.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.871
<i>It was a green station wagon.
He was parked outside the triage cube.</i>

09:39.280 --> 09:40.839
<i>How long has she been like this?</i>

09:41.000 --> 09:43.799
She was barely responsive
when admitted two weeks ago.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.838
- Comatose within a day.
- What happened?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.674
Well, it presented
as an acute allergic reaction.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.399
We treated her for anaphylaxis...

09:50.560 --> 09:52.711
...but her symptoms
didn't respond to treatment.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.075
In fact, they got worse.

09:54.280 --> 09:56.476
You didn't suspect
she might have been poisoned?

09:56.640 --> 09:57.960
Ms. Dahle had been treated...

09:58.120 --> 10:00.760
...for a severe tree nut allergy
twice in the past.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.071
Our diagnosis was in line
with her history.

10:03.240 --> 10:07.029
What if someone designed a poison
to mimic symptoms of an allergic reaction?

10:07.200 --> 10:11.672
It'd mean whoever created it knew we'd
treat the allergy and lose precious time.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.998
What are the chances
she pulls through?

10:14.160 --> 10:15.276
I can't answer that.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.591
We haven't found
antigenic foreign substances...

10:17.800 --> 10:20.360
...but the full tox report
could take weeks.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.558
- And she's not improving.
- Is that her husband?

10:23.720 --> 10:25.837
Yeah, Robert Dahle.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.276
He and Helen's parents
haven't left her side.

10:31.480 --> 10:35.360
One minute she's heading
to a client dinner and everything's fine.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.352
Then the next she's...

10:37.840 --> 10:39.513
...like this.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.512
This client dinner, who was there?

10:41.680 --> 10:43.433
A friend of Helen's from college.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.831
The police have already cleared her.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.918
What did Helen say
about the Panetti case?

10:48.120 --> 10:51.158
Nothing.
The attorneys instructed her not to.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.154
She knew how dangerous this was,
but agreed to testify anyway.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.154
I can't imagine how difficult
this must be for you.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.392
And you've been with her
the entire time she's been comatose?

11:00.560 --> 11:02.279
No, I...

11:02.440 --> 11:04.909
I went down to Sarasota Springs
this past weekend.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.073
Go on, Robert.
Tell them where you were.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.675
There's a little hotel in Sarasota.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.275
Sort of a getaway for us.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.437
Birthdays, anniversaries.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.399
We would've been married
10 years next month.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.995
Last weekend I went there to be alone.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.314
Think about what to do.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.073
With Helen...

11:25.400 --> 11:28.154
- ...in case she doesn't...
- Please, I'm begging you.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.000
Find out what happened to my wife.

11:32.160 --> 11:34.436
No, I got it, I got it. Okay?

11:34.600 --> 11:36.876
- Agent Navabi.
- Thank you for meeting me.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.076
What an unpleasant surprise.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.598
Mr. Panetti insisted on being present
for this conversation.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.270
That's fine with me.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.080
I fully intend on being present
the day he's sentenced...

11:46.240 --> 11:48.596
- ...for poisoning Helen Dahle.
- We never touched Helen.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.513
Not me or anyone who works for me.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.396
You asked for this meeting,
and we agreed.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.394
Please tell me it wasn't
so you could hurl baseless claims...

11:57.560 --> 11:59.313
...that you can't prove at my client.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.153
We know about the Apothecary.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.511
We know he specializes
in untraceable toxins...

12:03.680 --> 12:07.196
...and that you hired him
to create that "allergic" reaction.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.114
- What is she talking about?
- You can play dumb, Mr. Panetti.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.397
From what I hear,
you've made a profession...

12:12.560 --> 12:14.472
...out of skirting responsibility.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.836
- Now, hang on...
- We can find him on our own.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.277
When we do, you'll realize the trial
you're facing is a small matter...

12:20.440 --> 12:23.274
...compared to what happens
when the full force of the FBI...

12:23.440 --> 12:25.716
...comes down on you
and your organization.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.712
Or you can help us.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.159
This is about more than Helen Dahle.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.676
There are other people
we are trying to save.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.480
Lead us to the Apothecary now,
and we'll be very grateful.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.791
Honey, I don't know
what you're going on about.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.758
I think what my client means to say...

12:39.920 --> 12:43.436
What your client means is,
I've never heard of this Apothecary...

12:43.600 --> 12:45.910
...and for your information,
Helen's testimony...

12:46.080 --> 12:49.073
...wouldn't have hurt me
or my case one bit.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.232
- Is that right?
- Exactly right, sweetheart.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.914
The U.S. Attorney's got it wrong.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.999
I didn't pay anyone
to firebomb my competition.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.356
I'm the victim here.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.159
- Tell her, Arnold.
- It's true.

13:00.320 --> 13:03.950
Whoever took out Mr. Panetti's
competitor contacted us the next day.

13:04.120 --> 13:07.079
Threatened to destroy our business
if we didn't pay their fee.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.995
Now, my client did instruct Helen
to make that phantom payment...

13:11.160 --> 13:14.756
...but not for taking out a rival.
To avoid becoming a victim as well.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.195
I assume you can prove this?

13:16.360 --> 13:18.317
We can. And we would've at trial.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.080
So you see,
I had no motive to hurt Helen.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.310
Truth is, I liked her.

13:22.480 --> 13:26.394
And if you don't find the bastard
who did this to her, I will.

13:27.160 --> 13:30.198
And then you will have something
to charge me with.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.831
Arnold, give Agent Navabi copies
of whatever she needs.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.271
I think we're done here.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.709
Give it a go, sweetheart.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.599
Come on, hon.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.911
You can do it.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.593
Perfect.

13:59.760 --> 14:03.549
I know, dear. I don't want to,
but what choice do I have?

14:04.280 --> 14:07.352
I can't trust you to stay
if you're not sedated.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.751
You might try and run off again.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.151
We're not there yet, but we will be.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.198
I know we will.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.392
It's gonna happen.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.151
I can feel it.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.959
Hello?

16:24.080 --> 16:26.231
Who are you? Who put you in there?

16:26.400 --> 16:28.869
Is that a sick joke?

16:29.200 --> 16:31.032
You did.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.635
The forensic accountant
examined Panetti's financials.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.871
According to him,
the 200,000 was paid...

16:41.040 --> 16:45.159
...to the Atlantic Coast
Lepidopterology Research Institute.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.470
Lepidopterology?

16:46.640 --> 16:50.759
Its website advertises it as a nonprofit
dedicated to the research of butterflies.

16:50.920 --> 16:55.278
But it's not a 501 and it's not listed
in any directory of nonprofits I can find.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.476
In fact...

16:56.640 --> 17:00.395
...their entire board of directors
is made up of stock photo models.

17:00.560 --> 17:01.710
The charity's a fake.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.837
The 200K went
into a Swiss bank account...

17:04.040 --> 17:06.714
...and has since been wired
through dozens of other banks.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.480
The money's basically disappeared
into the ether by now.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.519
- Aram, I sent you a video.
- The lead on Panetti didn't pan out.

17:12.680 --> 17:13.875
Yeah, we've got nothing.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.390
Take a look at this.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.632
Helen Dahle's husband said
he had to get away to clear his head...

17:18.800 --> 17:20.553
...and think about his wife's future.

17:20.720 --> 17:24.509
Well, Robert Dahle did go
to Sarasota Springs...

17:24.680 --> 17:27.036
...and did stay in the hotel
he mentioned, but...

17:27.200 --> 17:28.680
...he did not stay alone.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.115
He was cheating on his wife.

17:30.280 --> 17:33.557
Are you saying the husband hired
the Apothecary to kill his wife?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.792
I'm just saying,
he definitely had a motive.

17:40.520 --> 17:41.954
When did I meet you?

17:42.160 --> 17:44.356
- Are you serious?
- Humor me.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.193
Last night.

17:46.880 --> 17:49.395
Before you threw me
in the car and drove here.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.313
Here... I... I... What?

17:51.480 --> 17:53.119
- Who lives here?
- How would I know?

17:53.280 --> 17:56.114
- I got here in a trunk.
- Right.

17:56.280 --> 18:00.718
I know this is an unusual...

18:01.040 --> 18:04.431
...and frightening predicament,
but I assure you, I mean you no harm.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.836
Says the man with the gun.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.275
- What is your name?
- Lou Lou.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.076
Lou Lou McLellan.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.037
Hey, hey, can you be careful
with that thing?

18:19.880 --> 18:23.954
Was I alone last night,
or was I accompanied by...

18:24.760 --> 18:27.400
...anybody? My associate...

18:29.680 --> 18:31.319
...Dembe.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.753
No.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.873
What is wrong with you?

18:45.040 --> 18:47.999
- I don't know.
- You need a doctor.

18:56.280 --> 18:59.114
We're looking for corticosteroids...

18:59.320 --> 19:00.640
...a bronchodilator.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.229
Go, go, go. I'm fine.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.959
Corticosteroids.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.190
I've lived my entire adult life...

19:32.400 --> 19:34.278
...surrounded by...

19:35.760 --> 19:38.150
...a corona of death.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.830
Some days I've even longed for it.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.276
But lately I find...

19:45.760 --> 19:48.673
...I'm unwilling to go gentle
into that good night.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.399
Bronchodilator.

19:55.680 --> 19:58.115
We were told Ilario Panetti poisoned her.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.591
That's what we thought too,
but the situation has taken a turn.

20:01.800 --> 20:06.272
- We found surveillance footage.
- Do either of you recognize this woman?

20:06.440 --> 20:08.193
- When was this?
- Last weekend.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.430
That's impossible.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.632
Helen and Robert have
a very happy marriage.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.154
He's a model husband.

20:13.320 --> 20:16.199
They've been head-over-heels
from the day they met.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.436
He'd never dream of straying.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.274
We had to bully her
into getting the prenup.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.079
There's a prenup?

20:22.280 --> 20:24.920
Helen's father, John Tadsen,
was a hedge fund titan.

20:25.080 --> 20:29.199
His New York firm was worth $4.7 billion.

20:29.360 --> 20:32.159
His children and his children's children
are set for life.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.631
To protect Helen from gold-diggers,
Tadsen made Robert sign a prenup.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.234
According to the agreement...

20:37.400 --> 20:40.598
...there's no payout
for death or divorce before 10 years.

20:40.800 --> 20:44.237
- How long have they been married?
- Two weeks shy of the 10th anniversary.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.518
So that's either
a really, really bad coincidence, or...

20:47.720 --> 20:52.556
Or Helen found out about the mistress
and Robert put her in the penalty box...

20:52.720 --> 20:55.110
...so she couldn't divorce
before the prenup expired.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.432
- What's the payout after 10 years?
- Close to 15 million.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.911
- We should bring this guy in.
- No, take a shot at the girlfriend first.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.720
Let's see just how much
she really loves this guy.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.349
- So are the police on their way?
- Who's Elizabeth?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.593
After I got those pills in you...

21:17.760 --> 21:19.638
...you came to. Well, sort of.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.593
Kept saying her name.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.280
Elizabeth.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.673
Someone who'd miss you if you died?

21:25.840 --> 21:27.160
I don't know.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.599
Maybe.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.597
Tell me your name again.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.434
Lou Lou.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.956
You saved my life, Lou Lou. Thank you.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.635
Like I needed a dead body
on my conscience.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.318
You were in bad shape. Worse shape.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.392
You try to hide it, but you're scared.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.836
I wasn't just gonna leave you.

21:50.520 --> 21:54.196
Well, it was remarkably generous given
that I locked you in the trunk of a car.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.080
You were pretty polite about it,
all things considered.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.991
I've been poisoned.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.555
By someone close to me.

22:17.320 --> 22:19.630
I need to figure out by who.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.076
What happened last night?
I can't remember.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.752
You and your friend broke
into the apartment across the hall.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.560
I called the cops,
and then I went over...

22:28.720 --> 22:31.110
...to peek through the door.
It was busted in, and there you were.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.636
I said the police were on their way,
and you said:

22:33.800 --> 22:38.158
"My sincerest apologies, but if that's
the case, then you're coming with us."

22:38.320 --> 22:39.640
Then you put me in the trunk.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.276
Why?

22:41.440 --> 22:43.671
Damned if I know.
But while you were asleep...

22:43.880 --> 22:46.190
...I found out who lives in that apartment.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.476
Marvin Gerard.

22:48.040 --> 22:51.078
- You know him?
- He's my attorney.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.713
It's over, Brooklyn.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.998
- Robert told us everything.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.197
You've been on the hook,
what, two, three...

23:04.400 --> 23:06.551
...years waiting for him
to leave Helen for you?

23:06.720 --> 23:09.872
You finally figured out that the only way
you'd ever be with him...

23:10.040 --> 23:11.269
...was over her dead body.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.591
And so you made a plan. Poisoned her.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.911
I'm not saying anything
until I have a lawyer.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.998
She's in a coma.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.600
Robert hasn't left her side.
Guess he changed his mind.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.274
That's not true.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.159
He told us you poisoned his wife.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.358
Now, if that's not true,
you better tell us what really happened.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.034
She treats him like a servant.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.032
He's carried her baggage
for nine years...

23:32.200 --> 23:35.398
- ...and he couldn't take it anymore.
- So you planned it together.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.957
- I didn't want anything to do with it.
- But you knew what he was doing.

23:39.120 --> 23:42.079
See, that makes you a coconspirator.

23:42.240 --> 23:45.517
Now, you wanna reduce your jail time,
tell us exactly how he did it.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.514
How did he put her in a coma?

23:48.280 --> 23:52.194
<i>- I don't know how it works.
- You'll need to tell us what you do know.</i>

23:52.360 --> 23:53.760
<i>It's a liquid.</i>

23:54.200 --> 23:55.236
<i>Some sort of drop.</i>

23:56.600 --> 23:57.829
<i>I've never seen him use it.</i>

23:58.040 --> 24:00.396
<i>I just know that he gives it
to her twice a week.</i>

24:00.560 --> 24:02.153
<i>Who did he get the poison from?</i>

24:02.320 --> 24:03.993
<i>He never said.</i>

24:04.160 --> 24:06.311
But I can tell you where he keeps it.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.999
What the hell? Hey.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.471
- Hey, you have no right to come into my...
- No-knock search warrant.

24:14.280 --> 24:17.751
I have no idea what you're looking for,
but I guarantee you won't find it.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.355
Unless you wanna parade that
on your perp walk...

24:20.560 --> 24:21.880
...I suggest you get dressed.

24:22.040 --> 24:25.954
- You think you're arresting me?
- As a matter of fact I do.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.398
For the attempted murder of Helen Dahle.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.631
If you want even a sliver off
your sentence...

24:30.800 --> 24:32.837
...you're gonna tell us
who made that poison.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.514
I have no idea what that is.

24:34.680 --> 24:37.354
Let's get this to the lab,
ID what kind of a poison it is.

24:37.520 --> 24:40.274
Maybe it'll tell us something
about whoever created it.

24:44.640 --> 24:49.317
Everything we've gone through
has finally paid off.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.232
We're pregnant.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.991
I wanted so badly to show you...

25:01.160 --> 25:03.311
...but I didn't want to jinx us.

25:05.640 --> 25:09.520
I know. Believe me,
I'm just as excited as you.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.078
What's wrong?

25:14.240 --> 25:15.356
The mobile.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.671
You don't love it.
You know what? You're right.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.674
I'll fix it. I want you to be happy.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.354
Everything's gonna be perfect.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.838
What were we doing here?

25:50.760 --> 25:52.194
Becky.

25:52.400 --> 25:56.189
I took you to Marvin's fiancée's house.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.516
Looks like he left in a hurry.

26:09.920 --> 26:13.072
<i>Marvin, it's Raymond. We're all here
at John's. Where are you?</i>

26:18.680 --> 26:20.319
John's.

26:20.480 --> 26:21.630
I know that place.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.190
- It's not far. I can take you.
- You've been...

26:25.560 --> 26:28.519
...kind to an extraordinary degree,
considering...

26:29.000 --> 26:31.231
...how we began our acquaintance.

26:31.440 --> 26:35.559
But I won't drag you any further into this.
You don't deserve that.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.310
I'll take it from here.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.398
Well, I hope you get better.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.235
And I hope you find
the answers you're looking for.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.357
I hope you get to see Elizabeth again.

26:56.240 --> 26:59.312
Guys, this Apothecary, this guy is good.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.871
- You got the toxicology report?
- He knew Helen Dahle.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.952
Sorry. Not "know" know, like he met her.

27:05.120 --> 27:07.715
He knew her medical history,
and he used it against her.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.837
Her doctors think
she went into a coma...

27:10.000 --> 27:12.959
...because of a reaction
to a tree nut allergy, but the truth is...

27:13.120 --> 27:18.718
...this Apothecary used some sort
of complex weaponized allergen...

27:18.880 --> 27:21.839
...to trigger the same reaction,
meaning her doctors...

27:22.000 --> 27:23.912
Were treating the symptoms,
not the cause.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.315
How does it help with Reddington?

27:25.480 --> 27:28.120
We have to find out
if he has pre-existing conditions...

27:28.280 --> 27:31.114
- ...which one was targeted...
- And find an antidote.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.239
- All in the next several hours.
- Right. That is the bad news.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.595
There's good news?

27:35.760 --> 27:38.878
The lab did find one distinct element
in the molecular structure...

27:39.040 --> 27:42.158
...of the drops taken
from Robert Dahle's apartment.

27:42.320 --> 27:47.190
<i>A peptide unique to the venom
of Bungarus flaviceps...</i>

27:47.360 --> 27:50.000
...also known as the redheaded krait.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.117
- Incredibly rare.
- So it's easy to trace?

27:52.280 --> 27:55.876
Only four suppliers in the world
and only one in America:

27:56.040 --> 28:00.717
A defunct reptile farm
outside of Scranton, PA.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.758
Hightower Serpentarium.

28:02.920 --> 28:06.357
Owned by Asa Hightower...

28:06.720 --> 28:08.757
...who, according to his license...

28:08.920 --> 28:12.118
- ...still lives in an apartment on site.
- Get there now.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.153
FBI!

28:25.480 --> 28:26.960
- Clear.
- Clear.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.200
I'm sending these to Aram...

29:31.360 --> 29:34.751
...to cross-reference them
with any unexplained poisoning deaths.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.400
There are dozens of victims here.
Here's Helen Dahle.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.951
Helen Dahle. Hey.

29:41.120 --> 29:42.918
Get these to the lab.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.914
Hopefully that file will help
the antidote for her.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.719
The wife's coming around.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.994
It's gonna be okay, Mrs. Hightower.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.879
Tell you...

29:56.560 --> 29:58.836
Are you trying to tell us
where your husband is?

30:01.240 --> 30:03.800
- What happened here?
- What happened?

30:03.960 --> 30:05.519
You summoned us here to dinner...

30:05.680 --> 30:09.196
...and locked us in the kitchen
without an explanation.

30:09.360 --> 30:11.556
Feel free to give us one now.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.189
Three of my accountants,
a couple money launderers...

30:14.360 --> 30:19.310
...a handful of investment advisors,
and bankers.

30:19.920 --> 30:23.391
Believe me, David, no one wants
an explanation more than I.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.040
Please...

30:25.200 --> 30:26.714
...accept my apologies.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.550
Just take me back to the dinner.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.752
- Tell me what happened.
- Mr. Reddington...

30:31.920 --> 30:33.639
...you invited us to dinner.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.110
We were sitting here.
You get up, make a speech.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.352
Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.

30:39.560 --> 30:42.997
I must admit I've never had
the pleasure of dining...

30:43.160 --> 30:45.391
...in this particular establishment before.

30:45.560 --> 30:50.396
I do wish we could enjoy it
under more auspicious circumstances.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.914
So be it.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.430
It was about the attack on your assets.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.034
By whoever killed Zack Smoll.

30:56.200 --> 31:01.753
I've always found stories of betrayal
to be so compelling...

31:01.960 --> 31:05.510
...so tragic for all those involved.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.433
Judas, lago.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.354
Men who were beloved
by those they betrayed.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.398
You were telling one
of those stories you love.

31:12.880 --> 31:16.078
If you're even thinking
about another parable...

31:16.240 --> 31:17.879
...I may strangle you myself.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.357
Ironic, isn't it?

31:20.560 --> 31:24.190
That the ones in whom we place
our greatest trust...

31:24.400 --> 31:27.791
...are best positioned
to put the knife in our backs.

31:27.960 --> 31:30.395
You said
you had Levine follow the money.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.597
The funds came
from one of your accounts.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.912
The 11 people to whom
I extended invitations tonight...

31:36.120 --> 31:40.592
...were the only ones who could have
accessed that particular account.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.150
One of those 11 is a traitor...

31:43.320 --> 31:46.233
...and only 10 of you are here.

31:46.400 --> 31:51.429
Perhaps our Judas didn't have the nerve
to attend this Last Supper.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.672
Well, I can assure you,
I will find the guilty party...

31:54.840 --> 31:58.959
...and he or she will be held accountable.

31:59.360 --> 32:00.680
Cheers.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.672
You sent the chef and his staff home...

32:02.840 --> 32:05.275
...took our phones,
you locked us in the kitchen.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.119
I'd prefer something stronger...

32:08.320 --> 32:09.640
...but this'll do for now.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.753
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- The wine.

32:14.920 --> 32:19.312
I had a glass of wine at the dinner.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.392
- Was it from one of these bottles?
- No.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.352
The waiter used a bottle
that was set aside.

32:24.800 --> 32:25.995
What bottle?

32:39.880 --> 32:41.758
Marvin Gerard.

32:44.160 --> 32:47.232
Aram, we need a list of all the stores
that sell baby products...

32:47.440 --> 32:49.432
<i>...in a 10-mile radius
of the serpentarium.</i>

32:49.600 --> 32:52.069
- Baby stores?
- Reddington. Did you find an antidote?

32:52.280 --> 32:55.512
There were no medical records.
Nothing about Reddington on file.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.592
<i>Wait, why are we looking
for baby stores?</i>

32:57.760 --> 33:00.798
Hightower's wife thinks
he's out buying nursery supplies.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.270
<i>- She's pregnant.
- I thought she was comatose.</i>

33:03.440 --> 33:05.238
<i>- That's when he assaulted her.
- My God.</i>

33:05.400 --> 33:08.438
The closest one is Albee Baby
in Harding.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.795
<i>Sending you an address.</i>

33:10.440 --> 33:11.590
Looking for a mobile?

33:11.800 --> 33:15.476
I thought perhaps the planets,
but I think we'll go with the dinosaurs.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.751
Reptiles have a special place
in our hearts.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.320
Well, congratulations.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.075
You must be thrilled.
How far along is she?

33:22.240 --> 33:23.640
Seven weeks. It's our first.

33:24.680 --> 33:27.559
Mom's on bed rest,
so the shopping is all up to me.

33:28.040 --> 33:31.511
Asa Hightower, FBI!
Hands where I can see them.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.593
Look around, agent.
You really want to start shooting here?

33:35.760 --> 33:37.956
We have your files. Your wife.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.959
She's eager to testify against you.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.556
Now put it down.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.479
Get down. On the ground.

33:52.280 --> 33:55.796
- How'd you know that'd work?
- You ever trip over one in the dark?

33:55.960 --> 33:57.519
They're lethal.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.712
<i>- Reddington.
- Elizabeth. Where are you?</i>

34:01.880 --> 34:03.394
Asa Hightower, the Apothecary.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.478
We have him in custody
and found his lab.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.074
Have you identified the toxin?

34:07.240 --> 34:09.675
The lab's working on it.
Not yet, but they will.

34:12.840 --> 34:14.034
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

34:14.199 --> 34:17.716
I found the wine that was used
to administer the poison.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.759
One of my men is bringing it to you now.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.992
If the Apothecary...

34:23.199 --> 34:25.078
...doesn't tell you what you need...

34:25.239 --> 34:27.118
<i>- ...the bottle will.
- Okay.</i>

34:27.280 --> 34:29.556
You're gonna be okay, Reddington.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.199
Reddington?

34:34.840 --> 34:35.876
Reddington!

34:42.760 --> 34:44.353
All right, let's keep this simple.

34:44.920 --> 34:45.956
We have two questions:

34:46.120 --> 34:49.112
Who paid you to poison Reddington,
and how do we cure him?

34:49.679 --> 34:52.878
My clients contact me anonymously
over the dark web.

34:53.040 --> 34:56.556
They don't want me to know who they are
and I don't want to know. Clean.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.996
The antidote for the poison
you gave Reddington.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.032
First of all, I did not poison him.

35:01.240 --> 35:04.597
I merely provided the means
for someone else to do so.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.114
I've never poisoned anyone.

35:06.280 --> 35:07.873
I'm sure your wife would disagree.

35:08.480 --> 35:11.314
My wife was running around
with Clive Hollis, I'm sure of it.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.949
She needed to be subdued.

35:14.120 --> 35:15.952
She's a very confused woman...

35:16.120 --> 35:17.600
...but she'll come around.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.075
Come around to what?

35:19.240 --> 35:21.311
The fact that you repeatedly raped her?

35:23.000 --> 35:26.311
Having raided my facility,
you're in possession of information...

35:26.520 --> 35:29.354
...that will help you solve
well over 20 cold cases...

35:29.560 --> 35:32.473
...and bring others out
of various altered states.

35:32.640 --> 35:35.997
You will return them
to their lives and families.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.277
Really, you should be thanking me.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.591
- You're delusional.
- I'm not crazy.

35:40.760 --> 35:44.276
I know you're gonna charge me
regardless of my innocence.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.875
But I have something you want,
and vice versa.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.480
- What's that?
- Simple.

35:48.640 --> 35:52.554
You take the death penalty off the table,
and I'll tell you how to cure Reddington.

35:52.720 --> 35:53.790
All that bravado.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.595
- You're afraid of the needle?
- I'm not afraid to die...

35:56.800 --> 35:58.598
...but I have something to live for.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.314
I'm gonna be a father.

36:00.480 --> 36:02.278
We've wished for a child for so long.

36:02.440 --> 36:03.920
Even from a jail cell...

36:04.080 --> 36:06.311
...we'll be a family.

36:11.520 --> 36:12.954
Hey.

36:15.720 --> 36:18.474
Didn't think he was a flowers kind of guy.
I was gonna go with wine.

36:18.640 --> 36:22.634
Then I remembered Mr. Reddington said
he may have been poisoned with wine.

36:23.320 --> 36:25.357
Besides, who doesn't like papaya?

36:25.520 --> 36:27.193
It's perfect. He'll love it.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.479
Mr. Cooper, you came.

36:29.640 --> 36:32.838
- What do we know?
- The Apothecary gave us all the antidotes.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.271
- It was given to Reddington?
- Last we checked...

36:35.440 --> 36:37.238
...he's still in critical condition.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.869
- Do we think the Apothecary lied?
- I don't know.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.235
He has to be okay.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.711
There's no shame in hoping
for the best, even for the worst of us.

36:45.160 --> 36:48.790
I want to caution you
against unwarranted optimism...

36:48.960 --> 36:50.110
...but he's stable.

36:50.280 --> 36:52.840
- For the moment.
- You think he'll recover?

36:53.000 --> 36:54.434
Too early to say.

36:54.600 --> 36:57.752
It'll be a while before we know
the extent of damage already done...

36:57.920 --> 37:00.754
...but the antidote does seem
to be working.

37:00.920 --> 37:02.559
Anything else you can tell us?

37:02.720 --> 37:06.839
Well, just that whoever poisoned him
knew his medical history intimately.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.153
The toxins were uniquely designed
to target his body chemistry.

37:11.320 --> 37:12.640
Can we see him?

37:12.800 --> 37:14.598
Well, he's just coming to.

37:14.760 --> 37:16.638
You should give him a few minutes.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.233
Welcome back.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.232
Did you find Marvin?

37:25.680 --> 37:28.639
Oh, yeah. I found the weasel.

37:30.760 --> 37:31.876
Tell me what happened.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.555
I put the word out,
we found him at Dulles.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.280
He was with his broad, the big girl.

37:37.480 --> 37:40.678
Bags packed,
headed for the South Pacific.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.115
Thank you, Glen. Good work.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.035
And Dembe?

37:56.480 --> 37:58.278
Have Marvin taken to that address.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.714
It's the tox lab.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.075
Yes?

38:10.080 --> 38:11.594
What?

38:11.920 --> 38:13.673
- I don't understand...
- What is it?

38:13.840 --> 38:16.309
That can't be right. Are you sure?

38:20.480 --> 38:22.119
Reddington, the result...

38:36.280 --> 38:39.000
Red, what the hell is this about?

38:43.080 --> 38:44.958
- Where's Dembe?
- Dembe?

38:45.120 --> 38:46.474
How would I know?

38:46.640 --> 38:50.077
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what this is about.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.277
Please wait outside.

38:57.840 --> 39:00.150
Unfortunately for this...

39:00.320 --> 39:01.959
...grand pantomime of innocence...

39:02.120 --> 39:04.635
...I know a great deal about all of it.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.393
I know about the wine.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.870
I know about you hiring Isabella Stone.

39:09.040 --> 39:12.397
About Zack Smoll, Stratos and his wife.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.392
I know you're one of very few people...

39:14.560 --> 39:18.395
...who had access to the account
that financed the attacks against me.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.040
It's why you didn't come to dinner.

39:20.200 --> 39:23.955
The only thing I don't know
is what you've done with Dembe.

39:24.120 --> 39:28.717
I didn't show up because Becky and I
were on our way to a Tahiti yoga retreat.

39:28.880 --> 39:33.238
It's a place we found when you sent us
down there last year, you remember?

39:34.280 --> 39:35.680
Tell me where Dembe is.

39:35.840 --> 39:40.790
Red, I swear to you, I don't know
any of what you're talking about.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.429
I shouldn't be surprised.
We're criminals, after all.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.877
- It's in our nature to betray.
- I didn't do...

39:47.040 --> 39:48.633
...whatever it is you think I did.

39:48.960 --> 39:53.000
Remember that wretched bit
of business on the Malay Peninsula?

39:53.200 --> 39:56.830
I was positive I would rot alone...

39:57.040 --> 39:59.760
...in that holding cell in Surat Thani...

39:59.920 --> 40:03.231
...slowly eaten alive by mosquitoes
to the constant refrain...

40:03.400 --> 40:05.039
...of body blows and screaming.

40:05.200 --> 40:08.955
Forty-seven interminable days
of near-constant rain.

40:09.120 --> 40:12.955
I couldn't be sure any
of my messages had been dispatched.

40:13.120 --> 40:18.878
And then, on the 48th day,
they swung the cell door wide...

40:19.040 --> 40:21.475
...and handed me a package.

40:21.800 --> 40:25.680
Half a dozen tins
of chilled Beluga caviar and a note.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.872
"Love, Marvin."

40:28.040 --> 40:30.680
When I think of it,
guards on two continents...

40:30.840 --> 40:33.116
...the bribes alone
must have cost you a fortune.

40:33.320 --> 40:38.156
I still can't fathom how you managed to
pull it off from inside a federal prison...

40:38.320 --> 40:42.280
...but you had my undying gratitude.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.877
So when the opportunity arose...

40:46.040 --> 40:47.918
...I facilitated your freedom.

40:48.080 --> 40:49.116
Exactly.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.910
Why would I betray you?

40:52.560 --> 40:54.040
We'll get to why soon enough.

40:54.600 --> 40:57.069
But first, I need to know about Dembe.

40:57.240 --> 41:01.075
Jesus, Red, I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

41:01.240 --> 41:03.630
It's Elizabeth Keen.
She says it's important.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.994
- Yes?
- The wine was clean.

41:08.160 --> 41:10.117
The tox lab said there was nothing in it.

41:10.320 --> 41:11.834
That's not possible. Check again.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.435
They said the poison had
to have been administered...

41:14.600 --> 41:16.910
...by something
with a higher alcohol content...

41:17.120 --> 41:19.999
<i>- ...like gin or...
- Scotch.</i>

41:20.200 --> 41:22.192
<i>Yes. Did you drink scotch?</i>

41:24.040 --> 41:25.633
I did.

41:29.120 --> 41:32.431
<i>But there are only two people
who had access to the bottle...</i>

41:32.600 --> 41:33.875
...and I'm one of them.

41:34.040 --> 41:35.793
<i>Who was the other?</i>

41:48.640 --> 41:50.632
No, it can't be.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.871
Raymond, are you okay?

41:53.040 --> 41:55.236
<i>Reddington, talk to me.
Who poisoned you?</i>

42:00.560 --> 42:02.677
That can't be.
