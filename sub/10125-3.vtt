00:10.200 --> 00:11.600
CORY, STOP.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.900
NICE LEVEL STROKE.

00:12.900 --> 00:15.700
JUST KISS
THE CUE BALL...

00:15.700 --> 00:16.700
SOFTLY.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.000
VERY SOFTLY.

00:22.133 --> 00:24.100
UH, I'M THINKING
DARTS.

00:24.100 --> 00:25.100
O.K.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.600
THE KEY TO THIS GAME

00:26.600 --> 00:29.233
IS TO BE VERY GENTLE
WITH THE DART.

00:29.233 --> 00:31.567
LET THE AIR
DO THE WORK.

00:31.567 --> 00:32.834
LIKE THIS?

00:32.834 --> 00:35.100
[SHAWN]
AAH!

00:35.100 --> 00:37.233
SORRY!

00:38.367 --> 00:40.700
UH, MAYBE IT'S SAFER
IF WE JUST TALK.

00:40.700 --> 00:43.967
YEAH. NO ONE EVER
GOT HURT TALKING.

00:43.967 --> 00:46.200
OH, UM,
ARE YOU'RE COLD?

00:46.200 --> 00:47.500
A LITTLE.

00:48.567 --> 00:49.734
A PERFECT FIT.

00:49.734 --> 00:51.367
YEAH.
JUST LIKE US.

00:51.367 --> 00:52.600
YOU KNOW, CORY,

00:52.600 --> 00:54.200
I WASN'T SURE
WHAT TO EXPECT,

00:54.200 --> 00:57.300
BUT MOVING FROM FRIENDS
TO BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND

00:57.300 --> 00:59.000
HAS BEEN REAL EASY.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.867
AND FUN.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.133
I THINK IT'S
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

01:05.133 --> 01:07.000
SUCH GOOD FRIENDS
FOR SO LONG.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
SO, CORY, ARE YOU FEELING
WHAT I'M FEELING?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.934
I THINK I AM.

01:11.934 --> 01:13.000
TOPANGA?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.867
YEAH.

01:14.867 --> 01:17.400
I LOVE YOU.

01:24.934 --> 01:27.600
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID?

01:27.600 --> 01:28.900
YES.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.033
CAN WE GO NOW?

01:48.600 --> 01:49.567
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

01:49.567 --> 01:51.000
IT'S THE WEIRDEST
THING.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.100
LAST NIGHT,

01:52.100 --> 01:53.700
I'M SITTING
AT CHUBBIE'S, RIGHT?

01:53.700 --> 01:54.834
I'M LOOKING DEEP

01:54.834 --> 01:56.667
INTO PAULA BALBOA'S
CHESTNUT EYES.

01:56.667 --> 01:58.000
I LEAN FORWARD,

01:58.000 --> 01:59.467
ABOUT TO MAKE
MY MOVE,

01:59.467 --> 02:00.967
WHEN SOME YAHOO
HITS ME

02:00.967 --> 02:03.934
IN THE BUTT
WITH A DART.

02:03.934 --> 02:05.000
HA HA!

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
YOU--YOU DIDN'T SEE
WHO IT WAS?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.400
NO.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.367
A LOT OF SICK PEOPLE
OUT THERE, MAN.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.300
SO HOW WAS
YOUR NIGHT

02:16.300 --> 02:17.500
WITH THE LOVELY
TOPANGA?

02:17.500 --> 02:20.100
IT WAS GOOD.
GOOD.

02:20.100 --> 02:21.400
90% GOOD.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.300
AND THE OTHER 20%?

02:26.200 --> 02:28.667
WELL, I--MAY HAVE
KIND OF

02:28.667 --> 02:30.900
GOTTEN CAUGHT UP
IN THE MOMENT

02:30.900 --> 02:32.200
AND SAID SOME THINGS

02:32.200 --> 02:33.934
THAT MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID.

02:33.934 --> 02:36.700
COR, DID YOU
GET EMOTIONAL
WITH TOPANGA?

02:36.700 --> 02:37.934
IT WAS HARD NOT TO.

02:37.934 --> 02:39.834
I MEAN, SHE LOOKED
SO BEAUTIFUL.

02:39.834 --> 02:43.100
YOU DIDN'T TELL
HER THAT, DID YOU?

02:43.100 --> 02:45.400
NO. SAY SHE'S BEAUTIFUL?

02:45.400 --> 02:49.700
YEAH. LIKE I'D SAY
THAT, SHAWN.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.700
I SAID,
"I LOVE YOU."

02:51.700 --> 02:52.834
[GASPS]

02:52.834 --> 02:54.734
WHAT?

02:54.734 --> 02:55.734
[GASPS]

02:55.734 --> 02:56.734
YOU IDIOT!

02:56.734 --> 02:58.233
ONCE WORD GETS AROUND,

02:58.233 --> 03:01.100
EVERY GIRL'S GOING TO
WANT TO HEAR IT.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.367
WHAT? I LOVE YOU?

03:02.367 --> 03:04.567
SHH. YOU'RE LIKE
A STINKING CANARY.

03:04.567 --> 03:05.734
COME ON.

03:05.734 --> 03:08.100
I DON'T BELIEVE
TELLING TOPANGA
I LOVE HER

03:08.100 --> 03:09.834
IS GOING TO
AFFECT ANYBODY

03:09.834 --> 03:11.200
BUT ME AND HER.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.200
HEY, ERIC.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.567

03:17.967 --> 03:19.000
WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.367
YOU HAVE SUCH AN ADORABLE
LITTLE BROTHER.

03:22.367 --> 03:24.000
I SURE DO, DON'T I?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.367
UHH!

03:26.467 --> 03:28.667
CHRISTI, I'LL
CATCH UP WITH YOU, O.K.?

03:28.667 --> 03:29.667
O.K.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.100
[LAUGHS]

03:31.100 --> 03:32.667
WHAT COULD YOU
BE THINKING?

03:32.667 --> 03:34.133
CHRISTI'S GOING TO
EXPECT ME

03:34.133 --> 03:36.233
TO TELL HER
I LOVE HER.

03:36.233 --> 03:39.000
OH, MAN. I GOT TO DO
SOMETHING NOW.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.200
YOU GOT TO THINK, ERIC.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.233
OW!

03:43.233 --> 03:44.800
THINKING CRAMP?

03:44.800 --> 03:45.900

03:54.233 --> 03:57.800
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HER LAST NAME.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.500
GREAT.
I GOT TO THINK.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.367
OW!

04:01.367 --> 04:02.867
YOU SEE, COR?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.700

04:08.300 --> 04:11.233
BUT EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT WITH ME
AND TOPANGA?

04:11.233 --> 04:12.700
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

04:12.700 --> 04:13.834
FROM THIS MOMENT ON,

04:13.834 --> 04:16.600

04:28.300 --> 04:31.967
[MR. FEENY]
DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!

04:31.967 --> 04:32.967
GO AWAY.

04:32.967 --> 04:34.100
STOP RIGHT THERE!

04:34.100 --> 04:36.233
HEY, CAPTAIN.
WHAT IS YOUR BEEF?

04:36.233 --> 04:41.100
MY BEEF, CAPTAIN, IS
THAT YOU JUST SNAKED
MY COFFEE.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.667
I PUT MY MONEY IN,
THE CUP DROPPED,

04:43.667 --> 04:45.600
THE COFFEE POURED--
IT'S MY COFFEE.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.300
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU PUT IN?

04:48.300 --> 04:49.567
A NICKEL.

04:49.567 --> 04:52.233
PRECISELY, A NICKEL.

04:52.233 --> 04:54.667
I HAD JUST DEPOSITED
75 CENTS,

04:54.667 --> 04:58.233
AND I TURNED MY BACK
TO GET MORE CHANGE.

05:01.367 --> 05:02.500
I GOT A SITUATION HERE.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.000
REMEMBER THAT INTERVIEW
WITH MR. FEENY?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.867
FIRST, I'LL TELL FEENY

05:06.867 --> 05:09.300
THAT HE'S GOT
LITTLE MUSTACHE MEN

ALL OVER HIS HALLS.

05:44.734 --> 05:48.500
SHAWN, ARE YOU INSANE?
YOU BULL-RUSHED ME.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.367
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

05:50.367 --> 05:52.400
SOMETHING'S WRONG
BETWEEN ME AND TOPANGA.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.800
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.300
NOT BY GIVING
HER THESE.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.700

DOING SOME THINKING.

OW!

06:04.834 --> 06:06.934
THE PROBLEM WITH
YOUR RELATIONSHIP

06:06.934 --> 06:09.500
IS TOPANGA'S GOT
ALL THE POWER NOW.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.767
WHAT POWER?

06:10.767 --> 06:14.400
THE POWER YOU GIVE UP
WHEN YOU SAY,
"I LOVE YOU."

06:14.400 --> 06:18.500
BUT I DO.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
SAYING HOW I FEEL?

06:18.500 --> 06:19.667
YEAH, YEAH.

06:19.667 --> 06:22.000
BUT THE LONGER
YOU CAN GO
IN A RELATIONSHIP

06:22.000 --> 06:23.567
WITHOUT SAYING
THOSE WORDS,

06:23.567 --> 06:25.233
THE MORE POWER
YOU HOLD.

06:25.233 --> 06:26.500
IT'S IN BOOKS, MAN.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.133
WHAT BOOKS
ARE YOU READING?

06:28.133 --> 06:29.567
<i>MEN ARE FROM MARS,</i>

06:29.567 --> 06:33.300
<i>WOMEN WANT TO BLOW</i>
<i>MARS OUT OF</i>
<i>THE STINKING SKY.</i>

06:33.300 --> 06:34.867
THEY'RE
AFTER US, COR.

06:34.867 --> 06:35.867
BE WARNED.

06:35.867 --> 06:38.500
HOW DO I GET
THIS POWER BACK?

06:38.500 --> 06:39.800
WAIT HER OUT.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.400
MAKE HER COME
TO YOU.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.967
BUT SHE'S AVOIDING ME.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.500
SHE'S MAKING A LIST.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.500
WHAT LIST?

06:45.500 --> 06:46.500
THE WHIPPED LIST

06:46.500 --> 06:49.667
OF ALL THE THINGS
SHE WANTS YOU TO DO.

06:54.600 --> 06:58.100
HAVE YOU TRIED
THE VIENNESE MOCHA?

06:58.100 --> 07:00.133
IT'S REALLY--

07:02.734 --> 07:03.834
IT'S HAPPENING.

07:03.834 --> 07:06.400
CORY, I WANT YOU
TO WAIT HER OUT.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.834
I DON'T WANT YOU
GOING NEAR HER.

07:08.834 --> 07:10.900
I WANT YOU TO
MAKE YOUR OWN LIST

AND ANTIQUE SHOPS.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.700
CORY!

07:18.700 --> 07:21.934
I JUST WANT HER
TO LIKE MY LIST.

ELI, WAIT.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.400
COME ON.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.400
LET GO.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.600
WAS IT THAT BAD?

07:29.600 --> 07:31.600
I STOLE HIS COFFEE.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.400
I DIDN'T KILL
ANYBODY.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.900
I'M SORRY, ELI.

07:35.900 --> 07:40.233
I STILL THINK
YOU WOULD HAVE MADE
A GREAT TEACHER, MAN.

07:40.233 --> 07:42.967
WHY? I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO KIDS.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.100
I DON'T EVEN
UNDERSTAND KIDS.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.400
BUT YOU KNOW HOW
TO COMMUNICATE
HONESTLY.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.500
THAT'S WHAT GOT ME FIRED
FROM PRODUCING THE 6:00 NEWS.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.200
I'M SHOWING PEOPLE SLUMLORDS
IN PHILADELPHIA.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.400
THE STATION MANAGER'S
SAYING,

07:53.400 --> 07:56.834
"LET'S SEE THAT WOMAN
WHO WALKS TO WORK NAKED."

07:56.834 --> 07:59.600
YOU'D MAKE A GREAT
MEDIA ARTS TEACHER.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.867
GETTING TO THE TRUTH--

08:00.867 --> 08:03.200
THAT'S WHAT THESE
KIDS NEED TO HEAR.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.467
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
BE HEARING FROM ME

08:05.467 --> 08:08.467
AFTER THAT
SESSION IN HELL
WITH MR. MUSTACHE.

08:08.467 --> 08:10.200
I PREFER
MR. FEENY.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.467
IS HE THERE
ALL THE TIME?

08:12.467 --> 08:13.600
ALL THE TIME.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.200
HAVEN'T YOU PUT ME
THROUGH ENOUGH?

08:17.233 --> 08:18.834
NOT NEARLY.

08:18.834 --> 08:21.367

ON MONDAY.

08:21.367 --> 08:22.667
START WHAT?

08:22.667 --> 08:23.667
MR. WILLIAMS,

08:23.667 --> 08:25.133

GREAT PASSION.

08:25.133 --> 08:26.500
I THINK OUR STUDENTS

08:26.500 --> 08:28.300
WILL BENEFIT
FROM A TEACHER

08:28.300 --> 08:31.667
WHO'S ACTUALLY LIVED
HIS SUBJECT MATTER.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.600
SO CONGRATULATIONS.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.600
COME ON, GEORGE.

08:34.600 --> 08:38.667
EVEN I GOT TO SAY,
QUIT YANKING THE GUY.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.033
I YANK YOU NOT.

08:41.033 --> 08:43.934
TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH,
MR. WILLIAMS,

08:43.934 --> 08:47.133
YOU REMIND ME
OF ANOTHER
DEDICATED YOUNG MAN

08:47.133 --> 08:50.200
WHO WAS FILLED
WITH FIRE AND FURY.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.967
GEORGE, YOU MEAN ME?

08:51.967 --> 08:55.567
I MEAN ME,

09:03.300 --> 09:09.300
[SPEAKING FRENCH]
YES CORY, ABSOLUTELY. WHEN IT
COMES TO AFFAIRS OF THE
HEART, I AM KING.

09:09.300 --> 09:13.000
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
HOW TO SPEAK FRENCH?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.033
I'M AN IDIOT
SAVANT.

09:15.033 --> 09:17.000
YOU DIDN'T
KNOW THAT?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.300
COOL.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.767
ANYWAY, GOOD NEWS.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.667
I'VE GOT THE POWER BACK.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.600
OH, TOPANGA
CAME TO YOU.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.667
SHE LEFT ME THIS NOTE.

09:25.667 --> 09:29.400
SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO
MEET ME HERE AND TALK.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.300
I COULD WRITE
A BOOK OF MY OWN.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.600
I'LL CALL IT...

09:33.600 --> 09:34.600

09:34.600 --> 09:36.800
<i>I HARDLY KNEW ME.</i>

09:36.800 --> 09:37.834

09:37.834 --> 09:41.400

19:47.000 --> 19:49.667
AND I HAD ONE
WITH A BROKEN BULB,

19:49.667 --> 19:53.767
AND THEN ERIC CAME
OUTSIDE AND STARTED
TEASING US?

19:53.767 --> 19:56.600
HE SAID,
♪ CORY LOVES TOPANGA ♪

19:56.600 --> 19:59.400
YOU SAID,
"YECCH. I HATE HER."

19:59.400 --> 20:01.967
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.834
CORY, WE WERE ONLY 6.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.400
WHO CARES?

20:05.400 --> 20:07.000
HOW COULD YOU KNOW THEN?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.233
I'M NOT SURE I KNOW

20:08.233 --> 20:10.100
WHAT "I LOVE YOU"
MEANS NOW.

20:10.100 --> 20:14.900
LOOK. ALL I KNOW IS,
YOU AND I
BELONG TOGETHER.

20:14.900 --> 20:17.500
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
ABLE TO TALK TO YOU,

20:17.500 --> 20:18.800
TO MAKE YOU LAUGH.

20:18.800 --> 20:23.300
AND I'VE ALWAYS,
ALWAYS WANTED TO
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.834
ALL RIGHT.

20:29.834 --> 20:33.800
TOPANGA, I'VE BEEN
COMPLETELY HONEST
WITH YOU.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.200
SO, I GOT
MY JEAN JACKET,

20:37.200 --> 20:39.934
SO I'LL LEAVE
YOU ALONE.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.500
SO THAT'S WHAT
"I LOVE YOU" MEANS?

20:45.500 --> 20:46.900
YEAH.

20:48.834 --> 20:50.000
BYE.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.400
CORY?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.900
UH-HUH.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.300
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

20:59.567 --> 21:03.033
I WAS ALWAYS
HOPING YOU DID.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.233
CHRISTI,
WE SHOULD RETHINK

21:28.233 --> 21:30.767
THIS WHOLE
"I LOVE YOU" THING.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.233
IT ONLY LEADS
TO HEARTACHE.

21:32.233 --> 21:34.000
TAKE MY LITTLE
BROTHER, CORY.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.033
THE ADORABLE ONE?

21:35.033 --> 21:38.300
HE TELLS
HIS GIRLFRIEND
HE LOVES HER.

21:38.300 --> 21:39.867
THEY DON'T EVEN
SPEAK ANYMORE.

21:39.867 --> 21:42.367
I'M TELLING YOU,
THOSE WORDS

21:42.367 --> 21:44.200
ARE DEATH TO
ANY RELATIONSHIP.

21:44.200 --> 21:47.200
LET'S JUST PRETEND IT
NEVER HAPPENED, O.K.?

21:47.200 --> 21:50.834
UH, TELL MOM AND DAD
I'M WALKING TOPANGA HOME.

21:50.834 --> 21:55.133
AND I'M TAKING
THE LONG ROUTE.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.033
POTTERY BARN?

21:59.033 --> 22:02.100
I LOVE YOU,
ERIC MATTHEWS.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.700
AND I LOVE YOU,

22:03.700 --> 22:05.100
CHRISTI...

22:05.100 --> 22:07.033
EEE...

22:07.033 --> 22:09.400
[LAUGHS]
