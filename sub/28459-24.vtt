WEBVTT

00:03.133 --> 00:03.400
- Tonight,

00:03.400 --> 00:04.000
- Tonight,
the reunion concludes.

00:05.433 --> 00:07.233
- It became a joke.
"Good-bye, Kyle."

00:07.266 --> 00:09.033
- Well, I'd say you were
just an asshole

00:09.066 --> 00:10.100
with iconic hair and lips.

00:10.133 --> 00:11.500
- Big lips.
- Yeah.

00:11.533 --> 00:15.100
- I'm still the nicest
----ing Lisa Rinna too.

00:15.133 --> 00:17.367
- At one point, I was literally
holding my eye open.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.400
- I can't figure out what
Denise's issue with me is.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.567
- You just said you didn't like
her and that she's boring.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.200
- I said season one Camille
times ten.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.500
- If you want me to be honest,
I'll be honest.

00:27.533 --> 00:28.633
- Times ten.

00:28.667 --> 00:31.033
- Oh, God, here she comes.

00:31.066 --> 00:32.266
- Welcome back.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.500
- Are you okay?

00:34.533 --> 00:37.433
- All of us have empathy for
what Lisa was going through.

00:37.467 --> 00:40.100
- I spoke to her
almost every day.

00:40.133 --> 00:41.400
- I don't think any of us
were mean girls.

00:41.433 --> 00:43.266
I don't think
any of us were bullies.

00:43.300 --> 00:45.333
- It's sad to think, like,
how she's feeling right now.

00:45.367 --> 00:47.200
She's got to be
feeling bad too.

00:47.233 --> 00:49.133
- There's no truth
to what you're saying.

00:49.166 --> 00:50.367
- Denise, stop it.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.133
- You're talking out
of your ass.

00:52.166 --> 00:53.500
- I've had a lot going on,
so I don't remember

00:53.533 --> 00:55.400
specifically
everything that happened.

00:55.433 --> 00:58.266
[tense music]

00:58.300 --> 01:00.166
- It's a sad end.

01:08.133 --> 01:11.467
- You said, "Tell your daughter
she's a ----ing liar,"

01:11.500 --> 01:13.400
and I said, "I'm not gonna
say that to my daughter."

01:13.433 --> 01:15.266
- I never said that, Camille.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.533
- You were telling me--
- What are you talking about?

01:17.567 --> 01:20.500
Honest to God,
you need to go take a second,

01:20.533 --> 01:23.066
because this is not good.

01:24.367 --> 01:26.700
- When you were sitting there
at lunch with Camille

01:26.734 --> 01:28.400
and she was
trash-talking everyone,

01:28.433 --> 01:30.367
what was going
through your mind?

01:32.333 --> 01:33.667
- I was really uncomfortable
because I didn't want to--

01:33.700 --> 01:36.433
- This is truly a setup.
This is truly a setup.

01:36.467 --> 01:38.433
- What is a setup?
- I'm done. I'm done.

01:38.467 --> 01:40.433
- What are you talking about?
- Did your own--

01:40.467 --> 01:44.166
- What are you talking about?
- I'm done.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.400
- Is she on something?

01:45.433 --> 01:47.533
- She did say she cursed
at her kids.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.266
----ing she did say that.

01:49.300 --> 01:52.567
- She's so angry.
- I'm not going through that.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.467
Bullsh--.
(BLEEP) them.

01:56.567 --> 02:00.166
- What happened?
- She's ----ing nuts.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.500
- Bullsh--, nasty bitches.
- What's the setup?

02:03.533 --> 02:05.467
- I never said that
about her daughter ever.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.667
- We're not allo--I mean--
- You guys, what just happened?

02:10.500 --> 02:12.400
- Take this off.
I'm leaving.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.567
Bullsh--.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.333
That's it.
I'm done.

02:15.367 --> 02:17.400
- Hey, what's--what's the--
what's the setup?

02:17.433 --> 02:19.400
What's the setup? What is it?
- Oh, come on.

02:19.433 --> 02:20.734
Andy, I'm done.
- Why? We're just--

02:20.767 --> 02:22.467
Hold on, hold on.
We're just going through--

02:22.500 --> 02:24.100
- Andy, they did say that.
- They did say what?

02:24.133 --> 02:25.433
- Denise did say
she cursed at her kids.

02:25.467 --> 02:27.233
- Okay, that's okay.
- She did!

02:27.266 --> 02:28.600
She told me that
the other day.

02:28.633 --> 02:30.400
She was like,
"I scream at my kids.

02:30.433 --> 02:31.667
Do you scream at your kids?"
and I was like--

02:31.700 --> 02:33.133
- I scream my goddamn
head off at times.

02:33.166 --> 02:34.433
- You do?
- Yes.

02:34.467 --> 02:35.567
- Do you feel bad after,
or you're, like--

02:35.600 --> 02:36.734
- I don't, actually.

02:36.767 --> 02:40.333
- Okay, then--
[laughter]

02:40.367 --> 02:42.667
- That's unbelievable.
- Okay, so then we'll show it.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.467
- But they're just making me
look like a really bad person.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.233
- What do you--
what do you mean?

02:47.266 --> 02:48.633
- She told me to tell
my daughter she was lying

02:48.667 --> 02:50.433
about the thing--something.

02:50.467 --> 02:52.133
- She doesn't--
- I never told her

02:52.166 --> 02:53.266
to tell her daughter
she's a ----ing liar.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.600
- No, you didn't.
You have to stop

02:54.633 --> 02:56.200
going down that rabbit hole.
You did not.

02:56.233 --> 02:57.567
- Denise, stop it.
It is not true.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.266
- You know what I would say
to my daughter?

02:59.300 --> 03:01.133
I would defend them,

03:01.166 --> 03:03.233
and I would make
my daughter feel like,

03:03.266 --> 03:05.400
"Don't worry, honey.
They didn't snub you."

03:05.433 --> 03:07.600
- I feel so bad for you,
Denise. Give me your hand.

03:07.633 --> 03:09.500
- I can take it. Please.
- No, I--

03:09.533 --> 03:11.233
- I am speechless,
and I am rarely speechless.

03:11.266 --> 03:12.667
- And, Dorit, I'm sorry.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.467
- But to say she didn't want us
at her wedding?

03:15.500 --> 03:18.233
- Don't pretend
that you like me

03:18.266 --> 03:20.533
and invite me to such
big moments like your wedding.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.367
- I have tried.
I have tried.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.133
Well, that was production,
because I didn't want to invite

03:24.166 --> 03:25.734
any ladies
to my wedding, honestly.

03:25.767 --> 03:27.767
- Oh, that's great.
- You can't say that.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.266
There has to be something else.
Nobody forces you.

03:30.300 --> 03:33.367
- You have power over yourself.
I mean, you do.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.700
- They were so nasty
about my wedding.

03:34.734 --> 03:36.333
- I know,
but you just told--I know.

03:36.367 --> 03:38.333
No, they were not nasty
about your wedding.

03:38.367 --> 03:40.300
They said that
the wedding was great.

03:40.333 --> 03:44.400
- Andy, they said the best part
of the wedding was leaving it.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.333
- No.
- They did.

03:46.367 --> 03:48.734
- What was the best part of
Camille's wedding, you think?

03:48.767 --> 03:51.467
- [sighs]
The departure.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.367
[both laughing]

03:53.400 --> 03:55.266
- Dude, that is so cruel.
- Why didn't you say that?

03:55.300 --> 03:56.500
Well, that is cruel.

03:56.533 --> 03:58.166
- And why did I invite them?
To be cruel?

03:58.200 --> 04:00.266
- Right. Right.
- I mean, that's so mean.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.300
Like, that's why I wasn't sure
if I even wanted them there.

04:03.333 --> 04:04.767
- Right, right.
- That's the point of this.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.533
- No one's ever told me
they wished I'd never been

04:07.567 --> 04:11.734
at their wedding or anything.
Ouch.

04:11.767 --> 04:14.000
- They're just so nasty,
and they've been wanting me

04:14.033 --> 04:16.367
to jump on this hate train
with Vanderpump,

04:16.399 --> 04:18.033
and I've had my issues
with Vanderpump,

04:18.065 --> 04:20.367
but sometimes Vanderpump
is so nice

04:20.399 --> 04:23.200
and caring and giving,
and I miss her.

04:23.233 --> 04:24.400
- Right.

04:24.433 --> 04:25.600
- And there's parts--
I understand

04:25.633 --> 04:27.300
what these girls
are talking about,

04:27.333 --> 04:29.367
but you could
still miss somebody.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.266
Andy, isn't it okay for me
to say something nice

04:32.300 --> 04:34.533
about Lisa without them
all jumping on me?

04:34.567 --> 04:36.367
- Of course, yes.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.367
- I feel ganged up because
I didn't gang up on Lisa.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.300
- I don't understand
what comes out of her mouth.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.567
- When she says,
"the hate train," it's so--

04:43.600 --> 04:46.000
She's literally
getting everything off Twitter.

04:46.033 --> 04:47.700
You guys are not getting it.
- Is that--is that off Twitter?

04:47.734 --> 04:49.767
- She's looking at Twitter
and going, "Okay, people think

04:50.000 --> 04:51.767
"Dorit's not genuine,
so I'll say that,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
"and people like that--
you know, feel like

04:54.033 --> 04:55.467
"Lisa's been ganged up on,
so now I'm gonna say

04:55.500 --> 04:56.600
"I'm not gonna be
part of the hate train,

04:56.633 --> 04:58.233
"'cause if I say
all this stuff,

04:58.266 --> 04:59.400
people will agree with me
and like me."

04:59.433 --> 05:00.700
That's what she's
----ing doing,

05:00.734 --> 05:02.000
and once again,
that's not being genuine.

05:03.734 --> 05:05.400
- I think that what
they're saying

05:05.433 --> 05:07.066
is that they feel like you say

05:07.100 --> 05:09.700
one thing to them
and another behind their back.

05:09.734 --> 05:10.734
- Mm-hmm.
- They want you--

05:10.767 --> 05:12.734
- They all do it, though.

05:12.767 --> 05:15.433
They have all talked about each
other behind each other's back.

05:15.467 --> 05:17.734
- I know, but the problem is,
I think that if you had said

05:17.767 --> 05:19.467
to them the entire time,

05:19.500 --> 05:21.233
"Lisa's my friend.
I'm not doing this.

05:21.266 --> 05:23.467
I'm not trashing her,"
and you were consistent

05:23.500 --> 05:25.000
about it the whole time,
I don't think

05:25.033 --> 05:26.633
they would have an issue
about it in different--

05:26.667 --> 05:28.633
- I can't figure out
what Denise's issue with me is.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.100
- I don't know.

05:30.133 --> 05:31.367
- That just was so weird,
right?

05:31.400 --> 05:32.700
- I don't know,
but you just said

05:32.734 --> 05:34.600
you didn't like her
and that she's boring, so--

05:34.633 --> 05:38.300
- Well, she is kind of--she was
kind of a wah-wah this year.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.100
- And to attack poor Denise?

05:40.133 --> 05:41.667
- Denise hasn't done
anything to anybody.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.667
- Nothing. I'm sorry.
- Clearly I have, (BLEEP).

05:44.700 --> 05:46.333
She's very angry.

05:46.367 --> 05:48.433
- Much angrier
than I'd ever realized.

05:48.467 --> 05:51.300
- Let's just take this
thing by thing

05:51.333 --> 05:52.500
and just--let's just see

05:52.533 --> 05:54.767
if we can move
to some resolution.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.433
- Okay.

05:56.467 --> 05:57.767
- I mean, you almost got naked
in front of me.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.367
I mean, that was a--
that was, like, shocking.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.000
- Andy's coming back.

06:02.033 --> 06:03.567
Guys, Andy's coming back.
We should clear.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.300
- Holy guacamole.
- All right.

06:06.333 --> 06:10.066
She really feels that you guys
want her to talk sh--

06:10.100 --> 06:11.433
about Vanderpump,
and I'm saying...

06:11.467 --> 06:12.667
- Why is she not getting that?

06:12.700 --> 06:14.633
- "They want you
to be consistent."

06:14.667 --> 06:16.000
- That's it.
- Is she coming back out?

06:16.033 --> 06:17.133
- Yeah, she's coming back.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.000
- What?
- Yeah.

06:19.033 --> 06:23.367
She's also upset because
you guys trashed her wedding,

06:23.400 --> 06:24.533
I think,
on the after shows in those--

06:24.567 --> 06:26.000
- I did say it,

06:26.033 --> 06:27.000
since then she told me
she hated me;

06:27.033 --> 06:28.066
I'm annoying, and--

06:28.100 --> 06:29.533
- Right, so...
- Yes.

06:29.567 --> 06:30.633
She's upset about that,
but what came first?

through a lot.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.600
You have been through a lot.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.600
- Now that we're all here
dealing with this,

16:42.633 --> 16:47.333
do you regret being so open
with your opinions this season?

16:47.367 --> 16:49.400
- I have been wrong,

16:49.433 --> 16:52.667
and I am sorry
if I've been cruel.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.567
- Very.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.500
- Mm-hmm.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.467
- It's okay.
- Okay, thanks. Thanks, Lisa.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.133
- 'Cause it felt like
you needed a hug.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.433
- All right,
we're gonna take a break,

17:03.467 --> 17:04.599
air this room out.

17:04.633 --> 17:07.099
- Thank God.

17:08.233 --> 17:09.300
- Coming up...

17:09.333 --> 17:10.599
What was in that bag,

17:10.633 --> 17:13.400
by the way,
that you packed for camping?

17:13.433 --> 17:15.467
- Well, everything. I had--
- Pills?

17:15.500 --> 17:17.099
- I always have my pills.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.700
[laughter]

17:25.633 --> 17:26.300
- From French châteaus

17:26.300 --> 17:26.633
- From French châteaus
to Hawaiian mahalos

17:28.567 --> 17:31.033
and private planes
to private islands,

17:31.066 --> 17:33.500
our jet-setting housewives
took their wanderlust

17:33.533 --> 17:35.767
to the next level.
Let's take a look.

17:37.767 --> 17:41.467
- This is "Advice
for the Traveling Housewife."

17:41.500 --> 17:45.367
The traveling housewife
always sticks to her budget.

17:46.367 --> 17:49.333
- Whoo-hoo.
- Private plane.

17:49.367 --> 17:51.333
First class all the way.

17:51.367 --> 17:52.767
- Hop on a private jet.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.433
It's just easier,
and it's so fabulous.

17:56.467 --> 17:57.734
- Bahamas, baby.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.500
- Whoo.
- This'll be fun.

18:01.066 --> 18:02.500
- Wow.

18:02.533 --> 18:04.100
- We're gonna introduce you
to your butlers.

18:04.133 --> 18:06.433
- Oh, we have a butler?
- Yes, you do, girl.

18:06.467 --> 18:09.433
- My butler had a bubble bath
with rose petals.

18:09.467 --> 18:12.400
- My butler didn't do that.
- How sweet is that?

18:12.433 --> 18:16.400
- [gasps]
- Wow. Oh, my God.

18:16.433 --> 18:19.734
- It's almost like
"Downton Abbey" but in France,

18:19.767 --> 18:22.100
like Downton France Abbey.

18:22.133 --> 18:27.033
- Welcome to Chateau Ventoux.
- It's gorgeous.

18:27.066 --> 18:29.500
- Welcome to my castle.

18:29.533 --> 18:33.033
- The traveling housewife
always packs light.

18:33.066 --> 18:34.433
- You're going camping
for one night.

18:34.467 --> 18:35.700
What is this stuff?

18:35.734 --> 18:37.734
- I want to be extra,
extra prepared.

18:37.767 --> 18:39.667
- One night?
- [laughs]

18:39.700 --> 18:41.367
You never leave
Beverly Hills.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.700
Like, we always
take that with us.

18:42.734 --> 18:44.633
I mean, come on.
We're divas.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.667
This is mine.
These two are mine right there.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.133
One, two.
Those are mine.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.734
- And this one too.
- This one is mine.

18:50.767 --> 18:53.000
- And this one.
Sir?

18:53.033 --> 18:54.467
- The traveling housewife

18:54.500 --> 18:57.100
doesn't enjoy herself
too much.

18:57.133 --> 19:00.400
- Walk the runway, ladies.
- Yes!

19:00.433 --> 19:04.734
- Drunk Rinna is here.
Whoo, here we go.

19:04.767 --> 19:08.700
- Those boots.
- Had to show 'em off.

19:08.734 --> 19:11.333
- Go.
Yeah, Lisa.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.533
- Hey.

19:13.567 --> 19:16.033
- I'm fine, children.
Come on.

19:16.066 --> 19:19.533
Mommy wants you to get out and
let me dry you off for lunch.

19:19.567 --> 19:22.367
- Stop ruining my vacation.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.100
[laughter]
- That's amazing.

19:25.133 --> 19:26.166
Wow.
You guys did a lot.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.533
- We did.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.400
- Ariella from Los Angeles
said,

19:29.433 --> 19:32.367
"Kyle, having a Rolex
Postmated to your dinner table

19:32.400 --> 19:35.734
is the level of diva
I aspire to be."

19:35.767 --> 19:38.033
- Look what just arrived.
- Get on it!

19:38.066 --> 19:39.500
Open it!
Open it! Open it!

19:39.533 --> 19:41.500
Oh, it's like
it's happening to me.

19:41.533 --> 19:43.000
- Oh, you ----ing bitch.

19:43.033 --> 19:45.567
- Oh!
- Put it on right now.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.500
You earned every bit
of this sh--.

19:48.533 --> 19:50.567
- Yay.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.367
- Do you always need Mauricio's
permission before splurging?

19:54.400 --> 19:55.667
- First of all,
I Postmated it

19:55.700 --> 19:57.533
because we were leaving
the next day,

19:57.567 --> 20:01.033
and the shop was closing,
and I couldn't leave the table.

20:01.066 --> 20:02.533
But when I make a big purchase,

20:02.567 --> 20:05.367
I like to discuss it
with my husband,

20:05.400 --> 20:07.100
and I'd like him
to do the same.

20:07.133 --> 20:09.367
- Erika and Dorit, do you
check in with your husbands?

20:09.400 --> 20:12.066
- Any big purchase, like,
I would say over $10,000,

20:12.100 --> 20:13.633
I would definitely
communicate with him.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.133
- Well, I'll say this.

20:15.166 --> 20:16.734
I'm not allowed
to buy my own jewelry.

20:16.767 --> 20:18.133
That's something
that Tom likes to do,

20:18.166 --> 20:20.633
and I have really pretty stuff.

20:20.667 --> 20:22.467
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.000
I think that I'm not
gonna go buy a car

20:24.033 --> 20:25.567
without his permission.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.400
- Audrey from Lafayette,
Louisiana, said,

20:27.433 --> 20:30.066
"Camille, your wedding was
so beautiful and elegant.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.600
How much did it set you back?"

20:31.633 --> 20:33.200
- Maybe it cost us
about $120,000?

20:33.233 --> 20:34.500
- Okay.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.467
- It's a lot.
- Yes.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.767
- It wasn't a million dollars
or anything, which is extreme.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.767
- How much did your
first wedding cost?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.700
- Oh, I don't remember.
It was--

20:44.734 --> 20:47.533
- Probably closer to a million?
- Closer, yes.

20:47.567 --> 20:49.100
- Yeah.

20:49.133 --> 20:50.233
- And a lot
was on security too.

20:50.266 --> 20:51.600
- Right.

20:51.633 --> 20:53.066
Allison from
Brownsville, Texas,

20:53.100 --> 20:54.734
"Can't believe
you all spent $700

20:54.767 --> 20:57.200
on one night of groceries."

20:57.233 --> 21:00.200
- We need hot dogs, hamburgers,
alcohol, sides.

21:00.233 --> 21:02.100
- Okay.
- We could get doughnuts.

21:02.133 --> 21:04.100
These cheese balls?
Do you remember these?

21:04.133 --> 21:06.100
- Do you think we're good
for one night?

21:06.133 --> 21:08.600
- No.

21:08.633 --> 21:11.467
- Teddi, what happened to all
the leftover food?

21:11.500 --> 21:13.066
- We donated it
to the other campers.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.500
- Oh, great.
- Like, when we left,

21:14.533 --> 21:16.400
we were like,
"Please have fun."

21:16.433 --> 21:18.200
- Ryan from Denver
wants to know,

21:18.233 --> 21:20.500
"Ladies, how often to you
grocery shop by yourselves?

21:20.533 --> 21:23.767
Besides Kyle, I'm betting
it's a rare occurrence."

21:24.000 --> 21:27.166
- No, they know me at Vons.
- Yeah?

21:27.200 --> 21:28.734
- I grocery shop
almost every day.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.233
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:30.266 --> 21:31.734
- What was in that bag,
by the way,

21:31.767 --> 21:33.066
that you packed for camping?

21:33.100 --> 21:35.133
- In my bag?
Well, everything.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.133
- Excuse me.

21:37.166 --> 21:39.000
- Don't mind us.
We're here for a lunch.

21:39.033 --> 21:42.033
- What the (BLEEP)
is in this bag, Rinna?

21:42.066 --> 21:44.467
A dead body?
Vanderpump?

21:44.500 --> 21:46.467
- Very many different
outfit changes,

21:46.500 --> 21:48.133
'cause you never know what
the weather's gonna be like,

21:48.166 --> 21:50.133
and I wore a lot of it.
I had--

21:50.166 --> 21:52.734
- Pills?
- I always have my pills.

21:52.767 --> 21:56.100
This is what I carry around.
- Wait, I bet you I can call--

21:56.133 --> 21:58.567
I bet you I can
name a bunch of those.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.600
- She's the resident pharmacy
in a good way.

22:01.633 --> 22:03.533
[laughter]

22:03.567 --> 22:08.133
- It was fascinating to see
y'all without your glam squads

22:08.166 --> 22:10.000
in Provence.

22:10.033 --> 22:13.033
[quirky music]

22:13.066 --> 22:15.166
♪ ♪

22:15.200 --> 22:17.033
- This hair's a mess.

22:17.066 --> 22:19.133
- How did you feel about
not having them there?

22:19.166 --> 22:21.567
- It's fine because the trip
didn't allow for it.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.100
I mean, we are capable.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.667
- Yes. Really.
- They're capable.

22:24.700 --> 22:26.700
- Kyle, where were you
more overserved,

22:26.734 --> 22:29.533
clubbing in the Bahamas
or wine tasting in Provence?

22:29.567 --> 22:32.600
- 1 million percent
wine tasting in Provence.

22:32.633 --> 22:34.633
- Which bottles
that you have preferred?

22:34.667 --> 22:36.633
- I liked one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

22:36.667 --> 22:38.166
Going night-night.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.734
No, we're not having
a ----ing chip, by the way.

22:40.767 --> 22:42.200
Put that ----ing chip down.

22:42.233 --> 22:43.567
- One--
Oh, (BLEEP).

22:43.600 --> 22:45.600
[laughter]

22:45.633 --> 22:47.100
I'm gonna talk about it.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.166
You want to talk about it?
Let's talk about it!

22:49.200 --> 22:52.033
- I didn't want to be rude.
- Right.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.734
- I don't even know how
you guys were--

22:53.767 --> 22:55.200
walked upright, literally.

22:55.233 --> 22:57.000
- Well, we were also
extremely jet-lagged.

22:57.033 --> 22:58.266
It was, like, 4:00 a.m. for us,
so at one point,

22:58.300 --> 23:00.066
I was literally
holding my eye open

23:00.100 --> 23:01.567
'cause I was trying
to stay awake.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.667
- You were holding
your eye open like that.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.667
- While ordering the margarita.

23:04.700 --> 23:06.700
That's--in the nine years
I've been on this show,

23:06.734 --> 23:08.333
that's the most I have consumed

23:08.367 --> 23:09.600
and the worst state
I've ever gotten in.

23:09.633 --> 23:11.066
- Really?
- Yes.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.200
- Really?
That's saying something.

23:12.233 --> 23:14.533
- Yes, it is.
Are you kidding me?

23:14.567 --> 23:16.066
- All right, we're gonna
leave it there.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.500
We'll be right back.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.500
Coming up...

23:20.533 --> 23:22.734
- I want to know how she found
the lie detector.

23:22.767 --> 23:25.734
- I had my doubts about
how you found out.

23:25.767 --> 23:27.200
- So hold on.

23:27.233 --> 23:29.600
This was before
production filmed it.

23:29.633 --> 23:31.767
That was the practice run.

23:38.734 --> 23:39.233
- Welcome back

23:39.233 --> 23:39.633
- Welcome back
to "The Real Housewives

23:40.734 --> 23:42.600
of Beverly Hills" reunion.

23:42.633 --> 23:45.033
By the time
Denise's wedding rolled around,

23:45.066 --> 23:47.266
it looked as if the
Lucy Lucy Apple Juice saga

23:47.300 --> 23:50.667
was finally put to its dog bed.

23:50.700 --> 23:54.567
But in Beverly Hills,
sleeping dogs don't lie.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.667
They give stories
to the tabloids.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.166
- I love her,

23:58.200 --> 24:04.066
but LVP is a genius
at manipulation and control.

24:04.100 --> 24:06.200
- There's an article
that just came out.

24:06.233 --> 24:08.133
"Stabbed in the back.

24:08.166 --> 24:10.033
"Lisa extra hurt
by longtime friend

24:10.066 --> 24:11.734
Dorit over abandoned dog."

24:11.767 --> 24:15.233
I know that she's got a
relationship with Radar Online.

24:15.266 --> 24:18.700
This is no longer
about Lucy and a lie.

24:18.734 --> 24:21.633
This is about my friendship
with Lisa Vanderpump.

24:21.667 --> 24:25.033
Even the verbiage she used,
and I say "she used"

24:25.066 --> 24:27.400
because I know
she leaked that story.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.200
- "Poor creature"?
- "Poor creature."

24:29.233 --> 24:31.333
That's what it was,
"the poor creature."

24:31.367 --> 24:33.066
- Kyle, answer the question.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.133
Have you ever known her
to leak stuff to the press?

24:35.166 --> 24:38.133
- I can't sit here and tell
this group of women,

24:38.166 --> 24:40.133
"I don't believe
Lisa would ever do that,"

24:40.166 --> 24:42.266
when she has been
accused of this in the past.

24:42.300 --> 24:44.300
- You've never sold a story?
- No. Never.

24:44.333 --> 24:46.166
- Never?
To Radar Online?

24:46.200 --> 24:47.433
- Sold a story?
- Sold a story.

24:47.467 --> 24:48.734
- What, said,
"You can have this story

24:48.767 --> 24:49.767
and you give me a check"?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.266
- Yes.
- No.

24:51.300 --> 24:53.433
On my children's life,
on my life, no.

24:53.467 --> 24:58.000
Kyle, I swear
on my children's life,

24:58.033 --> 24:59.734
on Vicki's life,

24:59.767 --> 25:04.033
I or nobody I know would give
a story to Radar about Dorit.

25:04.066 --> 25:05.667
You think I did that?
I'm done with you too.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.133
- I'm saying maybe you care

25:07.166 --> 25:09.133
more about your image
than your friendships.

25:09.166 --> 25:10.333
- They've been horrible.
Horrible.

25:10.367 --> 25:11.767
- I am so sorry.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.266
- All that shouting,
and they're all trying

25:13.300 --> 25:15.066
to make me feel like
I'm a terrible person,

25:15.100 --> 25:16.433
and I don't need that
in my life.

25:16.467 --> 25:19.667
These women
questioning my integrity,

25:19.700 --> 25:21.467
I don't appreciate at all.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.433
They don't even know what the
(BLEEP) they're talking about.

25:23.467 --> 25:25.433
What am I supposed to do,
take a lie detector test?

25:25.467 --> 25:27.233
Is that what they
want me to do?

25:27.266 --> 25:30.400
- Do you know who gave a story
to Radar Online about Dorit

25:30.433 --> 25:33.467
abandoning her dog?
- No.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.333
- Do you believe these women
who have accused you of giving

25:36.367 --> 25:40.233
a story to Radar Online
are your true friends?

25:40.266 --> 25:43.033
- No.
- And that was that.

25:43.066 --> 25:44.266
- Yeah.

25:44.300 --> 25:46.200
- Valerie from New York City
said,

25:46.233 --> 25:48.233
"As a practicing attorney,
you should know that polygraphs

25:48.266 --> 25:50.367
"are only about 70% accurate,

25:50.400 --> 25:53.066
and they are not admissible
in court."

25:53.100 --> 25:55.433
Erika, has Tom weighed in
on this topic with you?

25:55.467 --> 25:57.433
- He said the same thing.
- Is it 70%?

25:57.467 --> 26:00.266
- They're highly unreliable,
but they can be good

26:00.300 --> 26:03.000
if you get
the right person to do it.

26:03.033 --> 26:05.266
- I want to know how she found
the lie detector.

26:05.300 --> 26:07.000
- I want to tell a little story
about that

26:07.033 --> 26:08.767
because I know
that even you had your doubts.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.300
- I had my doubts about
how you found out.

26:11.333 --> 26:12.700
- Yes.

26:12.734 --> 26:14.734
- I was like, "Wait a minute,
do you swear

26:14.767 --> 26:17.066
that someone from production
didn't tell you this?"

26:17.100 --> 26:18.467
- No, I swear to you.
I even have a text message.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.000
- You got to tell the story.
- So my daughter,

26:21.033 --> 26:23.000
she had a friend
whose family was burglarized,

26:23.033 --> 26:26.767
and like we did, detectives had
the construction workers

26:27.000 --> 26:28.333
go down to take
a lie detector test.

26:28.367 --> 26:31.533
I did that with people
that work for us as well.

26:31.567 --> 26:34.333
- If you dispute the validity
of lie detector tests,

26:34.367 --> 26:36.233
why did you have
your own employees take one?

26:36.266 --> 26:37.700
- I didn't want to.
The detectives did.

26:37.734 --> 26:39.700
Someone who worked for me
actually failed,

26:39.734 --> 26:41.266
and I know that
she didn't do it, so--

26:41.300 --> 26:43.200
- What's the message?
- So anyway, she said,

26:43.233 --> 26:46.233
"Your mom's friend, the lady
with the dog, is down here."

26:46.266 --> 26:47.533
So hold on.

26:47.567 --> 26:49.300
This was before
production filmed it.

26:49.333 --> 26:51.767
- [gasps]
- That was the practice run.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.266
Then she later told production,
"I want to do this."

26:54.300 --> 26:56.533
- So what we saw
was her second time?

26:56.567 --> 26:58.500
- With a third party
and an animal

26:58.533 --> 27:01.133
and a jacket
over the blood pressure cuff.

27:01.166 --> 27:03.166
- You're supposed to be there
for 60 to 90 minutes.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.000
You ask five or six variations
of a question.

27:05.033 --> 27:06.433
You're supposed--

27:06.467 --> 27:08.233
- So why do you think she did
a trial run, then?

27:08.266 --> 27:10.367
- To see if she could pass.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.266
- To see what it
was all about so that

27:12.300 --> 27:14.500
when the cameras showed up,
she had a great performance.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.200
Ugh.
What the (BLEEP), man?

27:19.333 --> 27:23.100
- Now, the boss of Radar Online
came out with this statement.

27:23.133 --> 27:26.400
He said that Lisa was not
the source of that article

27:26.433 --> 27:29.133
and that she has never been

27:29.166 --> 27:31.333
an anonymous source
to that site.

27:31.367 --> 27:32.734
- Let me ask you a question.

27:32.767 --> 27:34.300
Do people normally
from tabloids

27:34.333 --> 27:35.500
make statements like that,
or they only do

27:35.533 --> 27:37.333
if they're friends
with someone?

27:37.367 --> 27:40.233
- So tell me what this
statement really meant to you.

27:40.266 --> 27:41.400
- It means
they know each other...

27:41.433 --> 27:42.767
- That they have
a relationship...

27:43.000 --> 27:44.400
- And they were
looking out for her.

27:44.433 --> 27:46.100
- And he's covering for her.
- A real close one.

27:46.133 --> 27:47.433
- Do you think Radar Online
was losing sleep

27:47.467 --> 27:49.500
over people thinking
Lisa gave the story?

27:49.533 --> 27:51.300
They came out
and said that

27:51.333 --> 27:53.300
because they had a conversation
where she said,

27:53.333 --> 27:54.500
"You need to come out
and say this."

27:54.533 --> 27:56.133
- I don't believe
she personally

27:56.166 --> 27:58.066
called Radar Online
and gave that story.

27:58.100 --> 27:59.400
- Camille, you've had a lot of
experience with the tabloids.

27:59.433 --> 28:01.266
What do you think happened?

28:01.300 --> 28:03.433
- I don't think she's--I just--
I don't think it was her.

28:03.467 --> 28:05.166
- Do you think someone
from her center?

28:05.200 --> 28:06.500
- Could be.
Could be somebody

28:06.533 --> 28:08.066
from her camp,
but I don't believe it was her.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.100
- Right.
- I don't think any of us

28:09.133 --> 28:10.233
believe that,
but somebody--

28:10.266 --> 28:11.600
- Okay, so well,
that's important.

28:11.633 --> 28:13.300
What do you think?
- Well, here's the thing.

28:13.333 --> 28:14.533
Well, Lisa Vanderpump
is not stupid enough

28:14.567 --> 28:16.467
to pick up the phone
and call anybody.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.433
She would have
somebody else do it,

28:18.467 --> 28:19.533
somebody from her center.

28:19.567 --> 28:22.200
Somebody planted that story.

28:22.233 --> 28:24.767
How many articles have we seen
from the "Daily Mail,"

28:25.000 --> 28:28.166
from Radar Online,
from Page Six, you name it?

28:28.200 --> 28:30.200
She announced through
the press

28:30.233 --> 28:31.500
that she wasn't
coming here

28:31.533 --> 28:33.300
and that she was
leaving the show.

28:33.333 --> 28:35.266
She talks through the press.
That's what she does.

28:35.300 --> 28:36.567
- Well, by the way,
I would've loved

28:36.600 --> 28:38.300
if she had called me
and said that too.

28:38.333 --> 28:39.600
- Wouldn't you?
- Yes, I would have.

28:39.633 --> 28:41.333
- Yeah.
- You know what's interesting?

28:41.367 --> 28:43.567
Lisa has called you guys
"stupid cows"...

28:43.600 --> 28:46.133
- It's easier bloody talking
at Congress than it is

28:46.166 --> 28:49.033
talking to that stupid cow.

28:49.066 --> 28:51.233
- "The real bitches
of Beverly Hills"...

28:51.266 --> 28:55.133
- Let the real bitches of
Beverly Hills go on their own.

28:55.166 --> 28:57.600

to pigs on Twitter.

29:02.166 --> 29:05.233
Dorit has changed her face
and her accent.

29:05.266 --> 29:07.200
- How come they didn't pick up
that that was a lie?

29:07.233 --> 29:09.500
- Ah.
- That's true.

29:09.533 --> 29:13.400
- Do you think Dorit's face
has changed in the last year

29:13.433 --> 29:15.567
as much as her accent?

29:15.600 --> 29:18.500
- She's had a head transplant.

29:18.533 --> 29:21.600
- We are being accused
of bullying and harassing her,

29:21.633 --> 29:23.433
and none of us have ever
stooped as low to say

29:23.467 --> 29:24.667
any of these things.

29:24.700 --> 29:26.333
She is the only one
who has said

29:26.367 --> 29:28.633
these type of things
about this entire group.

29:28.667 --> 29:31.400
- Let alone what she said
about Erika.

29:31.433 --> 29:33.633
- Just don't ask me if Erika's
tucking it under

29:33.667 --> 29:35.400
or something like that,

29:35.433 --> 29:37.667
because there are some things
I can't lie about.

29:37.700 --> 29:40.133
- Erika, people
have been Tweeting

29:40.166 --> 29:44.066
that you have said on the show,
"Oh, my dick is big."

29:44.100 --> 29:47.600
- I told you my dick got hard.
I'm telling you.

29:47.633 --> 29:50.700
- Is it different
you saying that than her

29:50.734 --> 29:52.567
if you're joking
about the same thing?

29:52.600 --> 29:54.433
- No, I say "suck my dick"
kind of like "kiss my ass."

29:54.467 --> 29:55.533
- Right, that's different.
- You know what I'm saying?

29:55.567 --> 29:57.400
- Right.

29:57.433 --> 30:00.500
- But to say that someone tucks
trying to take a swipe at me

30:00.533 --> 30:02.600
and be funny,
you actually hurt

30:02.633 --> 30:04.233
a very vulnerable community.

30:04.266 --> 30:06.233
- It's very insensitive.

30:06.266 --> 30:09.266
- Another thing for the viewers
that's tied in to all of this

30:09.300 --> 30:11.266
is the place
that she was in her life.

30:11.300 --> 30:14.333
Her brother
had committed suicide,

30:14.367 --> 30:18.700
and a lot of viewers felt that
at this moment in her life,

30:18.734 --> 30:24.600
it was a pile-on when she was
not in the best state of mind.

30:24.633 --> 30:26.600
- I think you feel
a little depressed.

30:26.633 --> 30:28.467
- I think you feel sad,
which is understandable.

30:28.500 --> 30:31.133
- I do feel depressed.
- I know.

30:31.166 --> 30:32.400
- I do.

30:32.433 --> 30:33.700
- I'm sorry.

30:33.734 --> 30:35.333
All of us have empathy.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.200
I mean, you'd have to be
not a human being

30:37.233 --> 30:40.166
to not have empathy for what
Lisa was going through.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.600
- I spoke to her a lot,
almost every day,

30:42.633 --> 30:44.333
and for hours on end.

30:44.367 --> 30:45.633
- I don't think any of us
were mean girls.

30:45.667 --> 30:47.300
I don't think any of us
were bullies.

30:47.333 --> 30:49.200
- It's not new behavior
is the thing.

30:49.233 --> 30:51.266
- I know she's told me
that she's not watching

30:51.300 --> 30:52.600
the show this season,

30:52.633 --> 30:55.367
and she's letting
other people tell her

30:55.400 --> 30:56.700
what's in the show...
- Why would you do that?

30:56.734 --> 30:58.433
- And she's reading about it
on Twitter.

30:58.467 --> 31:01.467
- Wouldn't she want to
defend whatever it is?

31:01.500 --> 31:03.266
- If you're surrounded
by a bunch of people

31:03.300 --> 31:05.200
that are only telling you
what you want to hear,

31:05.233 --> 31:09.600

33:29.033 --> 33:31.333
- Don't treat me
like sh-- again, then.

33:31.367 --> 33:32.667
I'm telling you.
- I didn't treat you like sh--.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.000
- You did.
- No, you--

33:34.033 --> 33:35.400
- You didn't invite me out.

33:35.433 --> 33:37.533
Why aren't you
my friend anymore?

33:37.567 --> 33:40.467
We're not the same, I know.
But it's changed.

33:40.500 --> 33:41.767
So what?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.033
There's all these
nasty rumors about Mauricio.

33:44.066 --> 33:46.633
There's been a lot of gossip
in the tabloids.

33:46.667 --> 33:48.667
- I'm gonna take her
to run my errands with me.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.133
- Okay.
- And then I'm gonna be--

33:50.166 --> 33:51.133
- This is where
the rumor comes.

33:51.166 --> 33:52.467
- Honey, you can't take her.

33:52.500 --> 33:55.000
- He's been seen
with a younger woman.

33:56.100 --> 33:58.000
- I had the tabloids
at my house,

33:58.033 --> 34:00.166
but she put it my luggage.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.433
She goes, "You need
to bring this."

34:02.467 --> 34:04.433
- I'm such an idiot.

34:04.467 --> 34:07.533
I want to know the truth about
the tabloids in the suitcase.

34:07.567 --> 34:10.000
- I didn't see the tabloids
until I got back.

34:10.033 --> 34:12.033
- No, that's not true.
We all saw them.

34:12.065 --> 34:13.333
- I didn't put them
in your suitcase.

34:13.367 --> 34:14.567
- Oh, come on.
This isn't a--

34:14.600 --> 34:16.734
This is a ----ing
sabotage attack.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.400
- I'm supposed to have said,
"Take the tabloid with you."

34:21.433 --> 34:23.567
Oh, whoopty-do.
Is that my biggest crime?

34:23.600 --> 34:25.567
- I look like a ----ing
abused wife

34:25.600 --> 34:27.033
with the black eye who says,
"Oh, I fell down the stairs."

34:27.065 --> 34:28.699
- Oh, my God.
- I can't do that.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.132
- Kyle doesn't want to pay
the price for going against

34:31.166 --> 34:34.065
Lisa Vanderpump.
It's a leveraged relationship.

34:34.100 --> 34:35.632
- I will not
----ing tell a lie.

34:35.667 --> 34:37.033
And you know what?

34:37.065 --> 34:38.632
To me, our friendship
is too important.

34:38.667 --> 34:40.100
- I'm not asking you
to tell a lie. That's not fair.

34:40.132 --> 34:42.600
- No.
I'm asking you not to tell one.

34:42.632 --> 34:45.367
- You think I'm gonna give
a story to Radar Online

34:45.400 --> 34:48.400
and then I'm gonna go to TMZ
and refute a story

34:48.433 --> 34:50.100
I've given to Radar Online?

34:50.132 --> 34:53.467
- That's what everybody
thinks, yes.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.033
I'm in a really
bad position here because--

34:55.065 --> 34:56.500
- Why are you
in a bad position?

34:56.533 --> 34:58.066
- Because as your friend,
I want to say,

34:58.100 --> 35:00.600
"That is not true."
- You're not her friend.

35:00.633 --> 35:02.200
You're not her friend.
- Yeah, I am, Ken.

35:02.233 --> 35:03.700
- You're not her friend.
- Yes, I am.

35:03.734 --> 35:05.533
- You are not her friend.
- Yes, I ----ing am.

35:05.567 --> 35:07.200
I'm just telling you
how it looked,

35:07.233 --> 35:10.200
and I--that doesn't mean
I don't love you,

35:10.233 --> 35:11.700
and I will stand by you.

35:11.734 --> 35:13.066
- I don't care
whether you love me or not.

35:13.100 --> 35:14.633
- Okay, but what
am I supposed to say?

35:14.667 --> 35:15.633
- You love somebody
that's got good character.

35:15.667 --> 35:17.133
Okay, whatever.

35:17.166 --> 35:18.734
- I didn't come here to fight.
- Okay.

35:18.767 --> 35:20.467
- I came here to tell you
this is the overall consensus.

35:20.500 --> 35:21.734
I care about you, and I have
a hard time defending you.

35:21.767 --> 35:23.467
- You came here to tell me
I am a liar.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.166
I think Kyle Richards
just enjoyed throwing me

35:26.200 --> 35:28.633
under the bus
a little too much.

35:28.667 --> 35:31.567
And unless she changed
her position and apologized,

35:31.600 --> 35:34.100
I've got no intention
of seeing her again.

35:34.133 --> 35:37.066
You know what, sweetie?
We're done.

35:37.100 --> 35:39.400
- Lisa's gone
so far with this.

35:39.433 --> 35:41.533
She's in so deep
with what she said.

35:41.567 --> 35:43.033
There's no turning back.

35:43.066 --> 35:44.633
- Good-bye, Kyle.

35:44.667 --> 35:48.767
- So how are we ever going
to repair this situation?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.233
- Get the (BLEEP)
out of my house.

35:50.266 --> 35:52.100
I swear to you
I'm done with it.

35:52.133 --> 35:56.033
For Kyle to say that to me,
I'm done with it.

35:56.066 --> 35:59.033

♪ ♪

36:02.233 --> 36:04.200
- Wow.

36:04.233 --> 36:07.767
What's it like
watching that back?

36:08.000 --> 36:11.200
- It's sad to me.

36:11.233 --> 36:14.133
It's--it's just--it is.

36:14.166 --> 36:17.033
It's sad to me.
It's sad to me she's not here.

36:19.133 --> 36:24.066
Um...I mean, people tweet me,
you know,

36:24.100 --> 36:25.600
pictures all the time,

36:25.633 --> 36:27.133
and every time
I see something like that,

36:27.166 --> 36:28.467
of us, like, joking
and laughing,

36:28.500 --> 36:30.100
it makes me feel bad.

36:30.133 --> 36:32.734
Sorry. I can't talk right now
for a second.

36:32.767 --> 36:34.533
Um...

36:34.567 --> 36:37.700
I paid the ultimate price
by being honest, you know,

36:37.734 --> 36:40.000
and I've thought about,

36:40.033 --> 36:42.233
you know, if I hadn't gone
to her house and not told her

36:42.266 --> 36:44.000
and then she would've
seen us sitting there,

36:44.033 --> 36:45.667
how would that have played out?

36:45.700 --> 36:47.600
It's just hard, you know,
when you care about someone.

36:47.633 --> 36:50.033
You think, "God, why the
(BLEEP) did you do this?"

36:52.567 --> 36:55.467
It's sad to think, like,
how she's feeling right now.

36:55.500 --> 36:56.767
This must be
a weird day for her.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.567
- It's got to be horrible.
- You know,

36:58.600 --> 37:00.500
knowing that we're all here
and she didn't come.

37:00.533 --> 37:02.567
She's got to be
feeling bad too.

37:02.600 --> 37:06.100
- It's a sad end.
- It is.

37:06.133 --> 37:08.166
- It is.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.567
You saw each other
at Neiman Marcus.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.767
What's your prediction
for the future?

37:13.000 --> 37:17.133
- I actually thought that--
well, I thought

37:17.166 --> 37:19.033
before I saw her
that she wouldn't--you know,

37:19.066 --> 37:21.266
wouldn't come, but--

37:21.300 --> 37:22.700
I don't know
why I keep doing that.

37:22.734 --> 37:24.567
But then when I bumped
into her,

37:24.600 --> 37:26.033
I thought honestly
it broke the ice enough

37:26.066 --> 37:28.066
that she would show up.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.233
- I hate to see it.

37:34.266 --> 37:37.500
Ken's infamous farewell
went viral

37:37.533 --> 37:41.266
in the form of the hashtag
"GoodbyeKyleChallenge."

37:41.300 --> 37:46.300
- Good-bye, Kyle.
- Good-bye, Kyle.

37:46.333 --> 37:50.734
- Good-bye, Kyle.
- Good-bye, Faye.

37:50.767 --> 37:53.600
- Good-bye, girls.

37:53.633 --> 37:55.500
- What was the intention
behind that?

37:55.533 --> 37:58.200
- So the "trolls" on Twitter
started saying, like,

37:58.233 --> 37:59.633
"You're this, and you're that.

37:59.667 --> 38:02.266
#GoodbyeKyle," like, meaning
they want me out.

38:02.300 --> 38:04.734
- Okay.
- So instead of sitting down

38:04.767 --> 38:08.133
and taking it, I decided
to make a joke out of it.

38:08.166 --> 38:10.300
So when we were out one night,
we walked past Sur.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.100
So then I started joking
with my friends,

38:12.133 --> 38:14.767
and then I got the Uber driver
to say, "Good-bye, Kyle,"

38:15.000 --> 38:16.734
and then everybody
started doing it.

38:16.767 --> 38:20.166
And here's another example of
Lisa trying to make me look bad

38:20.200 --> 38:21.700
while looking like
how wounded she is

38:21.734 --> 38:24.200
because my sister, Cathy,
went to their house,

38:24.233 --> 38:25.767
and she told me
that Ken was joking

38:26.000 --> 38:28.100
and saying, "Good-bye, Cathy,"
and they were laughing.

38:28.133 --> 38:30.133
So guess what.
You're not hurt by that.

38:30.166 --> 38:32.233
You also thought it was
----ing funny.

38:32.266 --> 38:35.367
And listen, Lisa has a lot
of amazing qualities.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.100
With that said,

38:37.133 --> 38:39.033
you take the good
with the bad with your friends,

38:39.066 --> 38:40.767
and that's a side of her that
I accepted, and, you know--

38:41.000 --> 38:42.333
- Same.

38:42.367 --> 38:43.734
- Okay, we're gonna
leave it there.

38:43.767 --> 38:45.767
Camille, thank you
for joining us.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.633
- Thank you for having me.

38:47.667 --> 38:49.767
- Anything you want to say
before you leave?

38:50.000 --> 38:53.066
- Well, that was
heart-wrenching,

38:53.100 --> 38:55.000
and I have a lot of emotions

38:55.033 --> 38:56.734
going on
and different feelings,

38:56.767 --> 39:00.600
and again, if I hurt you,
I'm sorry.

39:00.633 --> 39:04.333
And that's it.
And, Kyle, I adore you, so...

39:04.367 --> 39:06.100
- Thank you.

39:06.133 --> 39:07.400
- Thanks, Camille.
- You know, you're welcome.

39:07.433 --> 39:10.133
- Thank you.
- Good to see you, Andy.

39:10.166 --> 39:12.100
Bye, hon.
- Bye.

39:12.133 --> 39:13.567
- Bye-bye.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.767
- Bye, Camille.
- Bye. Bye. Bye, Andy.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.767
- Bye, Donatacci.
- Bye-bye.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.233
- It's great you showed up.
- [laughs]

39:21.266 --> 39:23.100
Awesome.
- You came.

39:23.133 --> 39:24.567
- I came.
- And you were here, Camille.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.400
Thank you.
- I came.

39:26.433 --> 39:28.266
- Coming up...

39:28.300 --> 39:29.266
- Do you want mine?
- You got to sip it.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.700
- Whoo.
- Right.

39:30.734 --> 39:32.333
- No. Oh, yeah, why not?
I'll have Erika's.

39:32.367 --> 39:34.133
- Yeah, drunk Rinna.
Come on.

39:34.166 --> 39:35.367
- Oh, my God, Rinna.
- Drunk Rinna.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.600
- Drunk Rinna.

39:42.533 --> 39:43.066
- We are back with

39:43.066 --> 39:43.367
- We are back with
our final moments

39:45.133 --> 39:47.467
with the real housewives
of Beverly Hills.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.433
Denise,
as the newbie of the group,

39:49.467 --> 39:52.433
I have to ask what's
the most surprising revelation

39:52.467 --> 39:54.300
you've had being a housewife?

39:54.333 --> 39:57.300
- Honestly, all the genuine
friendships that I've formed

39:57.333 --> 40:00.266
with these wonderful women,
and at the end of the day,

40:00.300 --> 40:02.400
I know every single
one of these women

40:02.433 --> 40:04.433
would be there for me
and vice versa,

40:04.467 --> 40:07.033
and that's something
so amazing and wonderful.

40:07.066 --> 40:09.266
Especially being in Los Angeles
and Beverly Hills,

40:09.300 --> 40:11.266
to have that
is really wonderful.

40:11.300 --> 40:13.467
- Erika, Kyle and Teddi
accused you

40:13.500 --> 40:17.133
of not being all in
with the group in Provence,

40:17.166 --> 40:19.367
but it was interesting to me
'cause I heard you say

40:19.400 --> 40:22.400
you had allowed yourself
to form a sisterhood

40:22.433 --> 40:26.734
with this group like you
had never formed in your life.

40:26.767 --> 40:28.300
- I think that I've been able

40:28.333 --> 40:31.333
to go to a place
that I hadn't before.

40:31.367 --> 40:34.200
I've never supported anybody
until I came into this group.

40:34.233 --> 40:35.433
- What do you mean?

40:35.467 --> 40:37.500
- I never found
a group of girls

40:37.533 --> 40:41.300
that I did not feel like
I was competitive with.

40:41.333 --> 40:43.033
- Do you think you've changed?

40:43.066 --> 40:46.000
- I think we have changed.

40:46.033 --> 40:47.200
- Dorit, some
of your friendships

40:47.233 --> 40:49.166
were really challenged
this year.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.333
Do you feel secure
with your place in the group?

40:51.367 --> 40:53.767
- I really do.
This group.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.300
[laughter]
- To the point.

40:56.333 --> 40:58.400
- This group.

40:58.433 --> 41:00.233
This group.
- This group.

41:00.266 --> 41:02.333
- Teddi, going forward,
will you still feel pressure

41:02.367 --> 41:04.200
to be the moral compass
of your friends?

41:04.233 --> 41:07.400
- You know, I think,
watching this back,

41:07.433 --> 41:09.767
I have some really
great friends in this group.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.500
I've learned a lot
from you guys.

41:11.533 --> 41:13.200
I've learned a lot
about myself.

41:13.233 --> 41:15.066
This was a good
wake-up call for me.

41:15.100 --> 41:18.300
- Rinna, last season,
we saw the nicest ----ing

41:18.333 --> 41:21.233
Lisa Rinna, as you said.

41:21.266 --> 41:23.467
What would you call the version
we saw this season?

41:23.500 --> 41:26.100
- Oh, gosh.
What would you guys call it?

41:26.133 --> 41:27.567
- Well, I'd say you were just
an asshole

41:27.600 --> 41:29.066
with iconic hair and lips.

41:29.100 --> 41:30.500
- Big lips.
- Yeah.

41:30.533 --> 41:34.066
- That's right. I was
very forthcoming, I think.

41:34.100 --> 41:35.467
- Yeah.
- I agree.

41:35.500 --> 41:37.467
- I'm still the nicest
----ing Lisa Rinna too.

41:37.500 --> 41:40.367
- Kyle, this season might
go down in history

41:40.400 --> 41:44.567
as the season that ended
your long friendship

41:44.600 --> 41:46.567
with Lisa Vanderpump.

41:46.600 --> 41:49.367
How else do you want
this season to be remembered?

41:49.400 --> 41:51.533
- Well, you know,
I'm asked a lot, like,

41:51.567 --> 41:54.233
"How are you still doing this
this many years?"

41:54.266 --> 41:56.333
And we have a lot
of fun together.

41:56.367 --> 41:59.400
I feel like even though
that door is closed for now,

41:59.433 --> 42:02.200
I don't know what will happen
with the future, but, you know,

42:02.233 --> 42:06.266
we have all bonded so much
and opened up

42:06.300 --> 42:09.133
and shared more with each other
than we ever have.

42:09.166 --> 42:11.000
I laughed so much this season.

42:11.033 --> 42:12.367
- Oh, my gosh.
Yeah.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.600
- And, you know, I enjoy
being with these women.

42:14.633 --> 42:17.066
- Can I open
the birthday present?

42:17.100 --> 42:18.500
- Are you kidding me?

42:18.533 --> 42:20.100
Fine, but you have
to put the bow back on

42:20.133 --> 42:21.367
'cause I have
to have it delivered.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.133
- I'm just curious.
It's been--

42:23.166 --> 42:24.433
Okay, it's from
Manolo Blahnik.

42:24.467 --> 42:25.533
- I need to have it
wrapped prettier anyway.

42:25.567 --> 42:27.200
I mean, it just was very her.

42:27.233 --> 42:29.367
- Oh, my God.
It's such a Lisa present.

42:29.400 --> 42:32.367
- I know.
- She would've loved this.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.100
- Maybe after seeing that,
she'll call you.

42:34.133 --> 42:36.133
- Now nine months.
- I know. She might.

42:36.166 --> 42:38.266
I feel like
I've seen this on her.

42:38.300 --> 42:39.533
- He's just saying that 'cause
he wants it for the clubhouse.

42:39.567 --> 42:41.467
- No, I don't want it.
No, no, no.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.467
- Oh, that would actually
be great.

42:43.500 --> 42:45.533
- Listen, I want it for myself.

42:45.567 --> 42:47.533
- Maybe it should go
to the clubhouse.

42:47.567 --> 42:49.266
- No, I got
to deliver it to her.

42:49.300 --> 42:50.533
- Okay. I think you should
send it to her.

42:50.567 --> 42:52.166
- I'm going to send it to her.

42:52.200 --> 42:54.667
I thought I was gonna
give it to her today.

42:54.700 --> 42:57.133
- Okay.
We have tequila shots.

42:57.166 --> 43:00.200
They're well-earned.
You all were troupers today.

43:00.233 --> 43:02.166
I appreciate you all
for being here.

43:02.200 --> 43:06.066
It was a wild season,
and I'm glad at least

43:06.100 --> 43:09.133
for the six of you
that you got some closure,

43:09.166 --> 43:12.367
which is a nice way
to end it right here.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.266
Does someone want to lead us
in a toast?

43:14.300 --> 43:15.433
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, wow.

43:15.467 --> 43:16.700
- Should we have
the queen, Kyle?

43:16.734 --> 43:19.200
- Here you go.
- Oh, my God. No.

43:19.233 --> 43:20.533
- I think it should be Kyle.

43:20.567 --> 43:21.700
- There you go, Dorit.
- Oh, wow.

43:21.734 --> 43:23.300
- Okay.
There you go.

43:23.333 --> 43:24.300
- At least it's
in the right glass.

43:24.333 --> 43:25.667
- Kyle?

43:25.700 --> 43:28.367
- I would just like
to say to friendships,

43:28.400 --> 43:30.533
to being honest
with each other,

43:30.567 --> 43:32.667
to being there for each other,

43:32.700 --> 43:35.600
and continuing to grow
in our friendships.

43:35.633 --> 43:37.233
I love you all.

43:37.266 --> 43:38.433
- I'm grateful to you women,
all of you.

43:38.467 --> 43:40.200
- Same.

43:40.233 --> 43:41.433
- Thank you, Andy.
- Thank you for embracing me.

43:41.467 --> 43:42.700
- Of course.
- Cheers.

43:42.734 --> 43:46.233
all: Cheers.
- Congratulations to you.

43:46.266 --> 43:49.100
Thanks for a great season.
- Mmm.

43:49.133 --> 43:50.667
- Mmm.
- Unh!

43:50.700 --> 43:52.567
- Do you want mine?
- You got to sip it.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.600
- No. Oh, yeah, why not?
I'll have Erika's.

43:54.633 --> 43:56.333
- Yeah, drunk Rinna.
- Oh, my God. Rinna.

43:56.367 --> 43:59.200
- Drunk Rinna.
- Drunk Rinna.

43:59.233 --> 44:00.700
- Yes.

44:00.734 --> 44:02.600
- Get on the table
and dance, Rinna.
