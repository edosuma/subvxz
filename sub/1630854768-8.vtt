00:02.819 --> 00:04.336
TK STRAND:
Alright, you guys ready?

00:04.563 --> 00:07.322
If we get any more ready,
we're gonna miss
the actual wedding.

00:07.399 --> 00:09.233
CARLOS REYES:
Okay, here we come.

00:09.235 --> 00:10.825
Hold on.
Let me set the mood.

00:10.845 --> 00:11.902
(beeps)

00:11.904 --> 00:13.661
(soft ambient music playing)

00:13.681 --> 00:14.722
(sighs)

00:18.352 --> 00:20.310
Oh, my God.

00:23.098 --> 00:24.356
-Wow.
-NANCY GILLIAN: You guys.

00:24.433 --> 00:27.192
I seriously feel like
I'm about to cry.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.527
Same.

00:28.678 --> 00:30.178
So, we like?

00:30.197 --> 00:33.090
-(camera shutter clicks)
-We love!

00:33.108 --> 00:34.450
OWEN STRAND:
I, uh...

00:35.185 --> 00:36.184
I don't know have words.

00:36.262 --> 00:38.095
Wow, Dad doesn't have words.

00:38.113 --> 00:39.112
-That's a good sign.
-Yeah.

00:39.189 --> 00:41.064
It's classic.
It's timeless.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.958
It's... It's beautiful and...

00:44.603 --> 00:45.285
it doesn't work.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.861
-(music stops)
-TK: What? Uh--

00:46.939 --> 00:48.288
How-how do
those things not work?

00:48.365 --> 00:49.790
I don't like
the pocket squares.

00:49.942 --> 00:51.032
Oh. Okay.

00:51.110 --> 00:53.293
Well, we could
get brighter accents.

00:53.445 --> 00:54.961
Yeah, I mean,
it's no problem.

00:55.114 --> 00:56.630
We can just change up
the pocket squares.

00:56.724 --> 00:57.798
It's not the pocket square.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.132
-But you just said--
-OWEN: Yeah, I know.

00:59.209 --> 01:00.300
I mean, it's not
just the pocket square.

01:00.452 --> 01:03.729
I think we have a larger problem

01:03.806 --> 01:05.880
with... color palette.

01:05.900 --> 01:06.973
What issue is that?

01:07.126 --> 01:09.293
It's bland.
It's like Paul's oatmeal.

01:09.295 --> 01:11.052
MATEO CHAVEZ:
But Cap, come on.

01:11.072 --> 01:12.479
The suits are so dope.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.997
BOTH: Thank you.

01:13.999 --> 01:15.299
We are not going for "dope."

01:15.317 --> 01:16.909
We're going for transcendent.

01:17.060 --> 01:18.468
Guys, I know
it must be frustrating

01:18.487 --> 01:19.561
but just stick with me on this,

01:19.580 --> 01:21.705
because this wedding
is going to be...

01:22.658 --> 01:23.665
out of control.

01:29.072 --> 01:31.381
Well, someone already is.

MARJAN MARWANI:
Hey, you guys
have a fire extinguisher?

02:06.034 --> 02:07.775
-No.
-MARJAN: Alright, get back.

02:07.853 --> 02:08.961
Is the motor still running?

02:09.037 --> 02:10.871
Yeah, we, we tried
the heater to cool it off.

02:10.947 --> 02:11.964
Alright, go turn off the engine.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.423
MAN: Okay.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.676
(engine stops)

02:21.033 --> 02:22.199
Okay.
Yep, that should do it.

02:22.217 --> 02:23.308
Thank you so much.

02:23.460 --> 02:25.202
-Yeah.
-WOMAN: I'm so embarrassed.

02:25.204 --> 02:26.628
I guess it just overheated.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.646
(sighs) It's all my fault.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.982
He wanted to stop in Tucson
to have it serviced.

02:30.133 --> 02:31.966
I said we should
get back on the road.

02:32.044 --> 02:34.153
Babe, no, no.
Don't beat yourself up.

02:34.304 --> 02:35.654
We both did.
It's not your fault.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.972
Hey, if you guys want,
I could maybe help patch you up

02:37.992 --> 02:40.159
and get you
to the nearest truck stop.

02:40.235 --> 02:41.718
Either of you know anything
about engines?

02:41.720 --> 02:43.069
I know of an engine.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.222
Ah. (chuckles)
I'll get my toolkit.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.708
(laughs)
I'm-I'm Grant, by the way.

02:48.744 --> 02:51.003
-This is Kiley.
-Marjan.

02:51.079 --> 02:52.629
Thank God
you're here, Marjan.

02:57.085 --> 02:58.251
So, Idaho plates, huh?

02:58.328 --> 02:59.678
You guys are
a long way from home.

02:59.905 --> 03:02.255
No. This is our home.

03:02.408 --> 03:04.016
Really? You live here full-time?

03:04.092 --> 03:05.425
-Going on four years now.
-MARJAN: Wow.

03:05.502 --> 03:07.519
GRANT:
Has everything we need.
Kitchen, TV.

03:07.596 --> 03:09.521
Bathroom's roomier than
the one in our apartment.

03:09.673 --> 03:12.766
Babe, you forgot
the most important thing.

03:12.842 --> 03:13.767
BOTH: Each other.

03:13.843 --> 03:14.918
That's, uh, that's sweet.

03:14.937 --> 03:16.195
Thank God our fans think so.
(chuckles)

03:16.346 --> 03:17.921
-Your fans?
-KILEY: Yeah.

03:17.923 --> 03:20.106
-We're travel vloggers.
-Oh.

03:20.183 --> 03:23.702
You actually might know
our Instagram, NextdoorNomads?

03:23.853 --> 03:25.095
We're still building the brand.

03:25.188 --> 03:27.355
That's cool. I'm on Insta.
I'll follow you guys.

03:27.433 --> 03:29.266
So what do you do for a living,
are you a mechanic?

03:29.268 --> 03:31.192
MARJAN: (laughs)
Rank amateur, I'm afraid.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.712
I, um, I used to be
a firefighter.

03:33.863 --> 03:34.955
That's impressive.

03:35.107 --> 03:36.531
Yeah, that's run its course.

03:36.608 --> 03:38.199
KILEY:
Well, until you did
some pro bono work

03:38.277 --> 03:39.626
on our smoking RV.

03:39.703 --> 03:40.719
-(Grant chuckles)
-Until that.

03:40.870 --> 03:42.054
What do you think
you're gonna do next?

03:42.130 --> 03:43.447
I don't know.

03:43.465 --> 03:46.299
Um, I thought
being out on the open road

03:46.376 --> 03:48.285
might help me find
some clarity or purpose,

03:48.287 --> 03:50.637
but so far,
all I've found is just--

03:50.789 --> 03:52.213
More road?

03:52.233 --> 03:54.233
Yep. Uh, okay, Grant,

03:54.309 --> 03:55.959
do me a favor
and turn it over for me.

03:55.961 --> 03:57.236
Yeah.

03:59.965 --> 04:01.631
(engine starts, screeches)

04:01.633 --> 04:03.891
Well, still sounds
like a cat in a blender.

04:03.969 --> 04:04.910
Yeah, you can kill it.

04:05.061 --> 04:06.436
-Kill it.
-Alright, alright.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.473
I, uh, think I know
what the problem is.

04:09.491 --> 04:12.826
Your AC compressor's seizing up,
the belt stopped spinning,

04:12.902 --> 04:14.068
and that's why
it started smoking.

04:14.146 --> 04:15.312
So, uh, can you fix it?

04:15.330 --> 04:16.255
Not a chance.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.757
I can cut the belt
and you'll be able to drive her.

04:18.908 --> 04:20.074
But until you replace that belt,

04:20.168 --> 04:22.335
it'll be like you're in
your own personal sauna.

04:22.488 --> 04:26.372
We, uh, we spent
last January in Yellowstone.

04:26.525 --> 04:29.009
We are comfortable
being uncomfortable.

04:29.011 --> 04:30.477
Okay, then.

04:33.832 --> 04:34.922
(tool snips)

04:35.000 --> 04:36.016
That's it, then.

04:36.092 --> 04:37.943
Good luck, you guys.

04:38.020 --> 04:39.853
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

04:39.929 --> 04:42.281
Oh, hey, you forgot this.

04:42.432 --> 04:44.858
You should keep that.
It might come in handy.

04:44.934 --> 04:46.535
Right. (chuckles)

04:50.699 --> 04:53.458

05:20.712 --> 05:21.570
Hands, Wesley.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.972
But, they're at 10 and 2.

05:24.992 --> 05:28.643
Actually, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration

05:28.662 --> 05:30.645
now recommends 9 and 3.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.556
Okay.

05:32.558 --> 05:33.665
So...

05:34.651 --> 05:36.001
Like this?

05:36.078 --> 05:37.911
What's the speed limit, son?

05:38.063 --> 05:40.914
It's 20.
25, I-I think.

05:41.066 --> 05:42.466
Twenty-five you think?

05:43.993 --> 05:45.585
Then why you pushing
26 and a half?

05:45.662 --> 05:47.495
I am?

05:47.514 --> 05:49.330
You're drifting.
You're-you're drifting!

05:51.835 --> 05:54.260
(both panting)

05:54.413 --> 05:57.597
Son, do you know why
I have a perfect driving record?

05:57.749 --> 06:00.174
Because you're
an obsessive-compulsive
control freak?

06:00.268 --> 06:04.087
Because I always stay focused.

06:04.180 --> 06:06.923
Now, engage
your right turn signal.

06:06.942 --> 06:08.108
Get ready to pull over.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.327
(indicator switch clicking)

06:11.113 --> 06:12.579
Now go towards those cans.

06:13.615 --> 06:15.098
Oh, no.

06:15.117 --> 06:17.117
You set up
a parallel parking test?

06:17.269 --> 06:18.435
DAD:
It's a parking simulator.

06:18.453 --> 06:21.438
Just think of those garbage cans
as luxury SUVs.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.106
WESLEY:
We don't have to
parallel for the test.

06:23.108 --> 06:24.198
DAD:
Well, I'm not preparing
you for the test.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.217
I'm preparing you for life.

06:25.368 --> 06:27.944
Now, align
the middle of the car

06:27.946 --> 06:29.036
with that can.

06:29.114 --> 06:31.297
-Dad, I know.
-Okay.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.875
Turn the wheel...
45 degrees.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.878
-(Wesley sighs)
-DAD: Be sure
to mind your mirrors.

06:36.955 --> 06:38.138
Your-your mirror!

06:38.214 --> 06:39.564
(Wesley groans)

06:40.976 --> 06:42.216
You just hit a minivan.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.235
There could have been children.

06:43.386 --> 06:45.145
(sighs) You told me
they were SUVs.

06:45.297 --> 06:48.148
Yeah, I also told you
to stay focused.

06:48.224 --> 06:50.316
It's hard with you
chirping in my ear.

06:50.469 --> 06:52.986
Look, I'm just trying
to get your head on straight.

06:53.062 --> 06:54.746
I won't always be
in the passenger seat

06:54.898 --> 06:55.972
when you get your license.

06:55.991 --> 06:57.582
Oh, you promise?

06:58.902 --> 07:00.977
Get out. I'm driving.

07:00.996 --> 07:02.337
(Wesley sighs)

07:03.165 --> 07:07.509
(tense music playing)

07:16.678 --> 07:21.106
Look, son. I don't ride you
because I enjoy it.

07:21.333 --> 07:24.851
I just do it because
I'm trying to keep you safe.

08:08.396 --> 08:10.972
Well, that is some parking job.

08:11.049 --> 08:12.382
Looks like he drove
up the guy-wire.

08:12.384 --> 08:16.052
That axle is sitting on
10,000 volts.

08:16.054 --> 08:18.312
-(coughs)
-Judd, call Utilities.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.499
Get them out here ASAP.
We gotta cut the power.

-WESLEY (over radio):
<i> Help us, please.</i>
-NANCY: Just hang on, Wesley.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.561
They're gonna get you down
as soon as they can.

08:24.579 --> 08:26.579
Dispatch connected us
to the father and son
on channel three.

08:26.732 --> 08:28.507
-What are we looking at?
-TOMMY VEGA: The son
says that his grandfather

08:28.583 --> 08:31.084
died of a heart attack
called a widow-maker.

08:31.202 --> 08:32.677
Sounds like his father's
having the same thing.

08:32.754 --> 08:35.238
-OWEN:
How much time do we have?
-Ten minutes, tops.

08:35.257 --> 08:37.073
Judd, we have
an update on Utilities?

08:37.075 --> 08:38.683
Spring Hollow's
the closest team.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.018
They're 15, 20 minutes away.

08:40.169 --> 08:41.520
Okay.
Which means 30. Alright.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.004
I want you to get
the aerial up there.

08:43.081 --> 08:44.581
Move in close,
but not too close.

08:44.599 --> 08:46.340
We gotta assume
that entire skin is juiced.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.084
-JUDD RYDER: Yes, sir.
-Alright, Paul, Mateo,

08:48.103 --> 08:49.435
you guys ever play Operation?

08:49.530 --> 08:51.178
-Paul smokes me at that game.
-Yeah, Cap, I dominate.

08:51.256 --> 08:52.197
Well you get to play it
in real life today.

08:52.274 --> 08:53.423
You guys are going up.

08:53.441 --> 08:54.533
Get a backboard, a bucket,
and some tape.

08:54.684 --> 08:56.926
-Got it, Cap.
-Yeah. You know their names?

08:56.928 --> 08:59.329
Father is Kevin,
son is Wesley.

09:03.101 --> 09:04.692
Hey, Kevin, Wesley?
We're gonna get you out.

take care of you.

09:13.128 --> 09:14.201
Please hurry.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.387
My dad's having
trouble breathing.

09:15.463 --> 09:18.056
Okay, I'm sure
that 9-1-1 has told you,

09:18.133 --> 09:19.299
but your car is electrified.

09:19.375 --> 09:21.284
<i> So I need you</i>
<i> to be very careful.</i>

09:21.303 --> 09:22.952

09:22.954 --> 09:23.895
<i> -You understand?</i>
-Yeah.

09:24.122 --> 09:25.121
Yeah, we understand.

09:25.123 --> 09:26.790
How are you gonna
get us out of here

09:26.808 --> 09:28.458
if the car is electrified?

09:28.460 --> 09:30.143
That's not something
you need to worry about, sir.

09:30.295 --> 09:32.145
Just sit back.
Let us do our job.

09:32.221 --> 09:34.573
(electricity crackling)

09:37.819 --> 09:38.910
OWEN:
A little closer!

09:39.062 --> 09:40.929
(Kevin groans, coughs)

09:41.005 --> 09:42.730
That's good, Judd. Closer!

09:42.749 --> 09:45.041
(ladder whirring)

09:47.646 --> 09:48.812
(Kevin wheezing)

09:48.814 --> 09:49.963
Easy.

09:51.650 --> 09:52.591
Easy.

09:52.742 --> 09:54.651
(ladder powers down)

09:54.653 --> 09:56.836
(Paul panting)

09:56.913 --> 09:58.488
Hey, there.

09:58.506 --> 09:59.598
You must be Wesley.

09:59.749 --> 10:01.324
-I'm Paul.
-Hi.

10:01.326 --> 10:03.843
-(Kevin coughs)
-You hanging in there, sir?

10:03.995 --> 10:05.662
KEVIN: Trying.

10:05.680 --> 10:06.996
Hey, Wesley.

10:07.015 --> 10:08.498
Listen, I know you're scared,

10:08.500 --> 10:10.183
but I'm gonna need your help
to help your dad, okay?

10:10.259 --> 10:12.468
-Okay.
-See this blanket?

10:13.596 --> 10:15.447
I need you to drape it
across the window frame.

10:15.598 --> 10:17.190
But, look, don't touch
any of the metal, okay?

10:17.266 --> 10:19.192
-Okay.
-There you go.

10:19.344 --> 10:22.011
Good.
There you go.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.847
Good.

10:23.865 --> 10:24.939
Alright, now you see this board?

10:24.958 --> 10:25.990
It's not a conductor.

10:26.217 --> 10:27.533
That means you
and your dad can climb on

10:27.610 --> 10:29.777
and you don't have
anything to fear, okay?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.278
-Okay.
-But remember,

10:31.373 --> 10:33.523
don't touch the window frame.

10:33.616 --> 10:34.591
Right?

10:37.120 --> 10:38.361
Come on. Come on!

10:38.363 --> 10:39.971
(electricity crackling)

10:40.123 --> 10:41.881
PAUL STRICKLAND:
Here it comes.
Watch yourself.

10:41.958 --> 10:43.475
(coughing)

10:43.977 --> 10:45.185
Alright, kid...

10:46.571 --> 10:50.206
Now, look, we need
to get your dad out first, okay?

10:50.208 --> 10:51.632
So I want you
to take this capture strap

10:51.652 --> 10:53.209
and I want you to help him
get it under his arms.

10:53.228 --> 10:54.727
-Can you do that for me?
-Yeah.

10:54.880 --> 10:55.987
Yeah. Yeah, you can.

10:56.064 --> 10:58.973
Alright, buddy.
Here you go.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.993
-WESLEY: Okay, Dad,
I need you to put this on.
-KEVIN: Oh God, oh God!

11:02.145 --> 11:03.995
No, we're not going anywhere

11:04.072 --> 11:05.555
until the power company
gets here.

11:05.557 --> 11:06.556
PAUL:
Hey. Hey, sir.

11:06.741 --> 11:08.725
With all due respect,
with your condition,

11:08.727 --> 11:09.817
that might be more time
than you have.

11:09.911 --> 11:11.336
-Dad, we should listen to him.
-KEVIN: No.

11:11.413 --> 11:12.729
-You need a hospital.
-I don't care.

11:12.747 --> 11:16.249
I'm not sending my son
out of a giant bug zapper.

11:16.401 --> 11:17.901
(groaning)

11:17.903 --> 11:18.993
-Come on! Come on!
-No!

11:19.070 --> 11:22.180
(groaning continues)

11:22.331 --> 11:24.599
PAUL:
Hey. Hey, guys.
We need to move now!

11:28.504 --> 11:30.188
Oh, my God.
Dad, just let me, please!

11:30.339 --> 11:31.764
No, it's too dangerous!

11:31.917 --> 11:33.191
Guys, we need to move now.

11:33.342 --> 11:35.342
Look, if we stay here,
we both die.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.103
So just shut up
and let me help you!

11:37.255 --> 11:38.254
-Okay.
-WESLEY: Okay.

11:38.256 --> 11:41.032
(electricity crackling)

11:44.112 --> 11:45.370
-WESLEY: Alright. Alright.
-(Kevin groaning)

11:45.597 --> 11:47.855
-Okay.
-KEVIN: Make sure it's buckled.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.023
Okay. He's in. He's in.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.357
PAUL:
Good, good, good. Okay.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.692
(grunting)

11:52.103 --> 11:54.528
Now, look, I need you
to help me get him
on the backboard.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.123
Alright? Now, Kevin,
I need you to tuck
your arms in, okay?

11:57.275 --> 11:58.291
Keep as still
as you can, okay?

11:58.367 --> 12:00.610
-Do not touch the frame.
-Okay.

12:00.628 --> 12:02.203
Dad, are you ready?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.889
Son, if anything happens--

12:05.041 --> 12:07.559
-(Kevin crying)
-I-- I know.

12:07.635 --> 12:09.894
(flames roaring)

12:10.121 --> 12:11.646
-Paul?
-Hey, man, I know. I know.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.294
That's right, help him out.
Easy.

12:18.296 --> 12:19.645
-Watch out now.
-(Wesley grunting)

12:19.798 --> 12:20.697
There you go.

12:22.150 --> 12:23.149
Okay, watch it, watch it.
Watch, watch, watch.

12:23.301 --> 12:25.134
Good. There you go.

12:25.153 --> 12:27.245
Easy. Easy.

12:27.396 --> 12:29.138
Watch your feet.
Watch your feet.

12:29.140 --> 12:31.124
Alright, Mateo,
he's clear, he's clear.

12:32.644 --> 12:35.044
-Get him on the backboard.
-Alright, let's go. Feet first.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.314
PAUL:
There you go.
Good job, sir. Good job.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.591
I got you.
I got you. I got you.

12:39.667 --> 12:40.759
(winces)

12:43.004 --> 12:44.512
I got him. Go get the kid.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.325
PAUL:
Wesley, you're up, okay?

12:49.344 --> 12:50.843
Now, keep your head down.
Let's go.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.753
There you go.

12:52.831 --> 12:54.314
There you go.

12:56.592 --> 12:57.258
Alright. Go.

12:57.335 --> 12:59.319
They're clear! Swing it.

13:00.763 --> 13:02.530
Swing it! Swing it!

13:04.117 --> 13:07.327
(electricity crackling)

13:27.198 --> 13:28.807
(Kevin groaning)

13:28.883 --> 13:29.974
Is my dad gonna be okay?

13:30.051 --> 13:30.975
I think so, buddy.

13:31.127 --> 13:32.459
He was lucky
to have you in the car.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.312
They're gonna put
a stent in at the hospital.

13:34.463 --> 13:36.722
He should be back on his feet
in about a week.

13:36.799 --> 13:38.149
A week?

13:38.226 --> 13:40.376
Dad, we can still
get my license.

13:40.395 --> 13:42.061
Uh, if you think I'm ready.

13:42.213 --> 13:44.823
Kiddo, you're ready
for anything.

13:44.974 --> 13:46.716
You know, Wesley is
gonna be a great driver.

13:46.885 --> 13:49.494
-Better than his old man.
-Alright, we're gonna
take you to West Park.

13:49.571 --> 13:52.055
Wes, you could
ride with us in the back.

13:52.057 --> 13:54.332
West Park? At this hour?

13:54.483 --> 13:56.893
The 35 will be a parking lot.

13:56.895 --> 13:59.170
We should go to St. Raymond's.

13:59.397 --> 14:00.321
You can take surface streets.

14:00.398 --> 14:03.490
Alright. Ready? Let's go.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.177
Looks like we're gonna
be in for a long run, Cap.

14:06.329 --> 14:08.388
Gotta love a control freak.

14:15.597 --> 14:16.855
♪♪

14:17.006 --> 14:18.764
Mm, this
chorizo and egg is fire.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.084
Mm. Barbacoa's not bad either.

14:21.086 --> 14:22.318
-You wanna switch?
-Uh-huh.

14:25.273 --> 14:26.513
Yo. Carlos,
what are you doing here?

14:26.533 --> 14:27.866
CARLOS:
Had a call in the neighborhood.

14:27.942 --> 14:29.033
Thought I'd surprise your son

14:29.185 --> 14:30.517
with some street tacos.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.929
Well, I hope you brought
enough tacos for everybody.

14:32.947 --> 14:34.430
I did, actually.

14:34.449 --> 14:36.023
MATEO:
Oh, you got us
Juan Juan tacos?

14:36.101 --> 14:38.117
He did get us Juan Juan tacos!

14:38.194 --> 14:40.962
Hey! You, sir,
are a golden god.

14:43.032 --> 14:44.123
You don't want one, Owen?

14:44.200 --> 14:45.942
Oh, no, no.
I can't have any tacos.

14:45.960 --> 14:46.885
I have a wedding to go to.

14:47.036 --> 14:48.277
Which reminds me,

14:48.296 --> 14:50.513
there is a cake tasting
tomorrow at the house.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.392
Is that, um, really necessary?

14:54.469 --> 14:56.452
I mean, we're just gonna go
with the traditional white,

14:56.471 --> 14:58.137
from the same
<i> panadería </i> that did

14:58.289 --> 14:59.063
both of my sisters'
<i> quinceañeras.</i>

14:59.215 --> 15:00.398
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

15:00.549 --> 15:03.142
No, I wanna throw
another candidate into the mix.

15:03.294 --> 15:05.570
-Another candidate?
-Yeah.

15:05.647 --> 15:08.406
I mean, look,
I-I have a place
on Alvarado Street

15:08.557 --> 15:11.743
that Is gluten-free,
sugar-free and dairy-free.

15:11.894 --> 15:13.152
Sounds flavor-free.

15:13.229 --> 15:14.470
(group laughing)

15:14.563 --> 15:15.988
Okay, You can laugh
all you want,

15:16.065 --> 15:17.248
but you'd be shocked
what you can do

15:17.325 --> 15:18.899
with monk fruit
and teff these days.

15:18.977 --> 15:21.144
-I'm sorry.
Did he say teff or teft?
-I don't know.

15:21.162 --> 15:22.736
OWEN:
You know, I've seen it
a thousand times.

15:22.814 --> 15:24.997
The party's going great,
and then they bring out the cake

15:25.074 --> 15:26.573
and everybody dives in
and they get

15:26.651 --> 15:29.928
that high fructose corn syrup
and then sugar crash,

15:30.113 --> 15:31.337
and everybody starts
heading for the exits,

15:31.489 --> 15:33.097
and the whole joy is just
sucked out of the wedding.

15:33.174 --> 15:34.507
-Imagine that.
-TK: Hmm.

15:34.659 --> 15:37.176
Alright. So, promise me
you'll just give it a chance.

15:37.253 --> 15:38.252
Tomorrow, three o'clock.

15:38.329 --> 15:39.562
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

15:42.183 --> 15:44.275
Just when I thought he couldn't
get any more Dadzilla.

15:44.427 --> 15:47.094
He puts monk's fruit
on our wedding cake.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.689
I believe it's just monk fruit.

15:49.841 --> 15:51.199
No possessive.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.119
What?

15:55.271 --> 15:59.106
Listen. He's just
asking to try it, okay?

15:59.184 --> 16:01.184
There's no try with your dad.
Only do.

16:01.186 --> 16:02.443
He's so controlling,
he's out of control.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.946
It's true.
He did strip 'em
of their pocket squares

16:05.966 --> 16:07.298
like a field marshal.

16:07.450 --> 16:08.633
Dude's drunk on power.

16:08.784 --> 16:10.376
JUDD:
Well, has anybody
thought about maybe,

16:10.528 --> 16:12.545
you know, talking to him,
saying, stand down.

16:12.697 --> 16:14.455
I've thought about it.
But, listen, honestly,

16:14.532 --> 16:16.123
I have never seen him
this excited

16:16.142 --> 16:18.384
about anything
in my entire life.

16:18.536 --> 16:20.645
Alright?
I, I don't wanna
make him feel bad.

16:20.796 --> 16:22.296
So we get to feel bad.

16:22.373 --> 16:24.482
Listen, you can say
something to him, too.
Mm-hmm.

16:24.559 --> 16:27.059
And kick off my son-in-law
relationship with a "back off"?

16:27.061 --> 16:28.302
-No, thanks.
-JUDD: Well, I don't know.

16:28.379 --> 16:29.895
I mean, me and, uh,
Gracie's dad

16:29.972 --> 16:31.214
had some pretty tough
conversations

16:31.216 --> 16:32.215
leading up to our wedding.

16:32.233 --> 16:33.399
PAUL:
Oh, yeah?

16:33.476 --> 16:35.827
How'd that work out
for you, man?

16:35.903 --> 16:36.977
We didn't talk for two years.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.055
(laughter)

16:39.057 --> 16:41.148
Yeah. Okay, so that's a no.

16:41.226 --> 16:42.483
MATEO:
Well, one of you
better say something soon,

16:42.502 --> 16:44.836
'cause I've seen his set list
for the reception.

16:44.912 --> 16:47.338
Let's just say
if you're not having it
on an actual yacht,

16:47.490 --> 16:49.823
this may not be
the rock you want.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.676
(laughter)

16:51.827 --> 16:53.327
Oh, my.

16:53.404 --> 16:56.038
Okay. No, that's it.
You guys are right.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.141
Somebody has to
stand up to him.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.602
And I know
just the person to do it.

17:04.932 --> 17:06.766
So...

17:06.918 --> 17:09.101
now you come to me

17:09.254 --> 17:11.446
about the day
of my son's wedding.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.015
We're sorry, Mama.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.926
It was wrong to exclude you.

17:16.928 --> 17:19.186
Yet you did exclude me.

17:19.280 --> 17:23.616
I offered you my guidance,
my wisdom, and you said no.

17:23.768 --> 17:25.434
CARLOS:
We didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

17:25.453 --> 17:27.712
We just wanted to make
the wedding our own.

17:27.863 --> 17:29.047
TK: Mm-hmm.

17:31.626 --> 17:32.699
So what changed?

17:32.719 --> 17:35.219
My father has gone insane.

17:35.296 --> 17:37.055
You let Owen get involved?

17:37.131 --> 17:40.391
Let him? He-he just
sort of took over.

17:40.543 --> 17:43.786
So we were hoping
that you could reel him in.

17:43.788 --> 17:46.064
CARLOS:
He doesn't like our suits.
He doesn't like our music.

17:46.140 --> 17:48.474
Now he wants to change the cake.

17:48.626 --> 17:51.235
Well, this all sounds
very unfortunate,<i> mijos.</i>

17:51.462 --> 17:53.813
You know, the relationship
with the in-laws,

17:53.965 --> 17:55.648
<i> los consuegros,</i>

17:55.724 --> 17:56.649
it's too important.

17:56.801 --> 17:58.058
It is the foundation

17:58.078 --> 18:00.636
of a happy bond
between the families.

18:00.638 --> 18:04.990
If Owen wants to take charge,
I cannot interfere.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.976
Mama.

18:06.994 --> 18:10.004
He wants to go
gluten-free on the cake.

18:10.998 --> 18:12.423
Mm-hmm.

18:13.985 --> 18:15.760
Oh, hell, no.

18:15.987 --> 18:18.154
(laughs)
No, no, no, no, no.

18:18.156 --> 18:20.172
That man
needs to be stopped now.

28:03.924 --> 28:05.474
Yes, yes. And look...

28:06.501 --> 28:08.477
I feel like
it's missing something.

28:09.838 --> 28:11.246
ANDREA:
Well, maybe I can help.

28:11.265 --> 28:13.265
Oh, I think
that's more than enough.

28:13.341 --> 28:14.433
Don't, don't you think, Mom?

28:14.585 --> 28:17.486
Yeah, we, we wanna
keep it simple.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.087
ANDREA: Drama.

28:19.106 --> 28:20.030
That's what's missing.

28:20.182 --> 28:22.090
-Yes. Yes.
-Something bold.

28:22.092 --> 28:24.109
Something that
makes a statement.

28:24.186 --> 28:26.094
-Something like, um...
-Um...

28:26.096 --> 28:27.454
BOTH: ...orchids!

28:27.873 --> 28:29.355

28:29.450 --> 28:31.099
-You. You're unbel--
-(Andrea laughing)

28:31.118 --> 28:32.859
Okay, we're going
to the florist later.

28:32.937 --> 28:33.769
Would you mind coming?

28:34.029 --> 28:35.379
ANDREA:
Oh, you try and keep me away.

28:35.530 --> 28:37.105
-OWEN: Ah. There we go.
-(Andrea laughing)

28:37.124 --> 28:39.049
What just happened?

28:39.159 --> 28:41.777
Our worst nightmare,
that's what happened.

28:41.779 --> 28:44.037
-This is good.
This is gonna be fun.
-Yeah.

28:44.114 --> 28:49.952
GRANT:
$1,457 for a frickin' fan belt?

28:50.045 --> 28:53.880
Damn it.
How-how the hell are we
gonna afford this, Kiley?

28:53.958 --> 28:56.382
We'll just have to
post a few more videos
this month on Instagram.

28:56.460 --> 28:59.570
Oh, yeah.
And rake in a whole ten bucks!

29:01.315 --> 29:04.057
I knew we should have
stopped in Tucson.

29:04.134 --> 29:06.577
If we max out the credit card,
it's your ass.

29:08.063 --> 29:10.539

29:11.233 --> 29:13.375

29:18.406 --> 29:19.506
(engine stops)

29:20.334 --> 29:22.426
You've gotta be kidding me.

29:26.915 --> 29:28.824
What the hell, man?

29:28.826 --> 29:30.325
You got a problem, son?

29:30.327 --> 29:31.602
Yeah.
You charge me 2,000 bucks

29:31.678 --> 29:33.604
and my RV's in worse shape
than when I brought it in.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.331
-It won't even start.
-What are you talkin' about?

29:36.350 --> 29:38.834
I fixed that compressor myself.

29:38.927 --> 29:40.110
It was runnin' just fine.

29:40.187 --> 29:41.686
I don't know
what to tell you.

29:41.839 --> 29:42.988
Still giving you trouble?

29:43.765 --> 29:45.023
Yeah. Now...

29:45.100 --> 29:46.766
-it won't turn over.
-MARJAN: Seriously?

29:46.786 --> 29:49.177
It was, uh, starting just fine
out on the road.

29:49.196 --> 29:51.346
Well, now it makes
a sputtering sound and dies.

29:51.348 --> 29:52.956
Sputtering like, uh, k-k-k

29:53.033 --> 29:55.125
or is it like a louder,
like a ka-ka-ka?

29:55.277 --> 29:56.668
Like the engine's
trying to crank?

29:58.798 --> 30:00.355
Cranking, I-I guess.

30:00.374 --> 30:02.357
Huh. So not the starter then.

30:02.359 --> 30:04.784
Uh, sounds like you should
probably look at the engine.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.470

This is literally
highway robbery.

30:08.882 --> 30:10.382

does my car not start?
Come on, man.

30:13.053 --> 30:14.144
-This is ridiculous.
-MECHANIC: Who knows?

30:14.296 --> 30:17.147
Everything looks okay.

30:17.224 --> 30:20.400
Let's just check the fuse panel
to be sure.

30:21.045 --> 30:22.236
-Huh.
-What?

30:22.971 --> 30:25.305
Fuel pump relay was out.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.565
That's funny.

30:26.733 --> 30:29.451
It's almost like somebody
unplugged it. (chuckles)

30:34.834 --> 30:36.250
Where's Kiley?

30:37.744 --> 30:39.002
Kiley!

30:43.584 --> 30:44.991
MARJAN:
Wave goodbye.

30:45.069 --> 30:47.660
'Cause you are never
gonna see her again.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.753
What did you do?

30:48.848 --> 30:50.848
I had to put an end
to the epic romance

30:50.924 --> 30:52.599
before its tragic ending.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.435
GRANT:
She's always been weak.

31:03.529 --> 31:06.922

31:06.924 --> 31:08.407
And who she belongs to.

31:12.946 --> 31:15.414
(pensive music playing)

31:28.962 --> 31:30.779
Are they as exquisite
as you pictured?

31:30.781 --> 31:32.614
Ugh. Better.

31:32.616 --> 31:35.450
We're gonna put one of those
on every single table?

31:35.452 --> 31:36.952
FLORIST:
Except for the grooms',
of course.

31:36.954 --> 31:38.211
On yours, we'll have three.

31:38.288 --> 31:40.230
Wow, it's gonna get
really jungly in there.

31:40.307 --> 31:43.141
Do we think
that they could be...
bigger?

31:43.218 --> 31:44.309
-No. No.
-No, it's great.

31:44.461 --> 31:45.736
-It's perfect.
-CARLOS: Mm-hmm.

31:45.887 --> 31:47.812
I think we can do 15% bigger.

31:47.965 --> 31:49.314
OWEN:
Get out of my head.

31:49.466 --> 31:51.575
-I was gonna say 15%.
-(Andrea chuckles)

31:51.726 --> 31:53.059
Guys, it's beautiful.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.394
But it all also seems...

31:54.413 --> 31:56.321
-(softly) ...very expensive.
-TK: Mm-hmm.

31:56.473 --> 31:59.065
-Oh, no, no, no.
They're on me.
-On us.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.492
No, no.
I would never dream.

32:00.644 --> 32:03.587
Don't argue
or you'll hear from Gabriel.

32:03.738 --> 32:04.813
On us.

32:04.831 --> 32:06.256
That's very nice of you guys.

32:06.333 --> 32:09.742
But money aside,
this all feels like a lot.

32:09.820 --> 32:10.910
It's not so much, TK.

32:11.004 --> 32:12.078
Mom, we're gonna have

32:12.156 --> 32:13.246
more flowers
than the Fiesta Parade.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.007
You only get
married once,<i> mijo.</i>

32:16.084 --> 32:17.008
Twice in your case.

32:17.161 --> 32:18.493
But only once
to someone you love.

32:18.512 --> 32:20.604
That is very generous
and we appreciate it.

32:20.755 --> 32:24.015
But we were hoping to go
for something classic and easy.

32:24.168 --> 32:26.092
Like roses and lilacs.

32:26.170 --> 32:28.019
CARLOS:
And isn't that the point, Mom?

32:28.172 --> 32:29.863
-TK: Mm-hmm.
-To do what we want?

32:31.341 --> 32:34.618
(sighs)
Well, maybe we can...
do 'em as accents.

32:34.769 --> 32:36.269
What do you think, Owen?

32:36.288 --> 32:37.437
Hmm...

32:37.623 --> 32:39.272
I guess we could.
We could put it in the arches.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.682
Would that be possible?

32:40.701 --> 32:43.776
-Certainly.
-There's a flower arch now?

32:43.854 --> 32:44.795
Four, actually.

32:44.871 --> 32:46.946
ANDREA:
I love flower arches.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.190
They're so magical.

32:48.208 --> 32:49.299
OWEN:
So magical.

32:49.376 --> 32:50.450
I mean, who doesn't
love a flower arch?

32:50.527 --> 32:52.877
-ANDREA: Ah!
-Uh... I don't, Dad.

32:52.954 --> 32:54.454
Why not?

32:54.473 --> 32:56.306
I don't think
you guys are hearing us.

32:56.458 --> 33:00.202
We don't like
flower arches or orchids.

33:00.204 --> 33:02.145
What we really liked
was our pocket squares.

33:02.297 --> 33:03.388
-Remember those?
-Okay, babe.
Just take it easy.

33:03.540 --> 33:05.798
No, Carlos.
This isn't us, alright?

33:05.818 --> 33:07.209
None of this feels like us.

33:07.227 --> 33:09.302
Look, I know
this is very stressful.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.213
It is, but trust me on this.

33:11.231 --> 33:13.715
When the big day comes
and everything looks beautiful,

33:13.734 --> 33:15.158
-you're gonna thank us.
-Mm-hmm. That's right.

33:15.385 --> 33:17.052
OWEN:
And we're doing it all for you.

33:17.070 --> 33:18.311
No, you're not. Oh, my God.

33:18.388 --> 33:19.645
You are doing this for you

33:19.665 --> 33:22.148
so you can control everything
like you always do.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.559
And I am sick of it.
And, Dad, you're fired.

33:24.561 --> 33:27.562
-Fired from what?
-From planning the wedding.

33:27.564 --> 33:28.563
Both of you are.

33:28.823 --> 33:31.425
You can't fire us
'cause you didn't hire us.

33:32.586 --> 33:33.593
Exactly.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.564
You're not gonna talk to me?

33:47.860 --> 33:49.067
Why should I?

33:50.254 --> 33:51.570
You were gonna leave me.

33:52.847 --> 33:53.846
But I didn't.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.240
You mean you couldn't.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.276
I don't know
what I was thinking.

33:58.353 --> 33:59.611
The idea of living without you,

33:59.687 --> 34:02.497
it, it isn't a life
because I love you so much.

34:05.693 --> 34:06.668
(shaky) Babe?

34:08.047 --> 34:09.713
Aren't you gonna
say anything?

34:12.200 --> 34:13.717
(softly whimpers)

34:15.220 --> 34:17.345
Look at me. Look at me.

34:18.173 --> 34:19.130
Don't you dare cry.

34:19.207 --> 34:22.559
You do not get to cry.

to figure out is,

34:31.386 --> 34:33.695
when did you start scheming
with that bitch?

34:35.148 --> 34:36.965
Was it at the truck stop

34:36.983 --> 34:38.742
or before
on the side of the road?

34:40.637 --> 34:43.747

34:44.917 --> 34:46.583
We were having
such a bad fight, Grant.

34:46.660 --> 34:47.900
And you scared me.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.311
I just, I wanted a friend.

34:49.329 --> 34:53.256
Well, where's your friend now?

34:53.333 --> 34:56.760
She abandoned you
just like everybody

34:56.987 --> 34:58.320
abandons you.

Except me.

35:03.827 --> 35:06.103

we were raised old school,

36:25.075 --> 36:26.850
didn't have the experience of

38:24.878 --> 38:26.428
(music continues)

38:28.473 --> 38:29.764
Baby?

38:31.868 --> 38:33.310
-Grant.
-(shouts) What?

38:35.480 --> 38:36.704
-(music stops)
-What do you want now?

38:36.723 --> 38:39.482
(whimpers) I'm sorry.
It was hurting my ears.

38:41.561 --> 38:42.527
I'm sorry.

38:44.305 --> 38:46.197
What are we doing?
Why are we stopping?

38:52.331 --> 38:54.405
What did I say
about the crying, Kiley?

38:54.558 --> 38:56.407
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-GRANT: What did I say?

38:56.484 --> 38:58.743
You know what
my old man used to say?

38:58.895 --> 39:02.080
You wanna cry?
Then I'll give you
something to cry about.

39:02.232 --> 39:03.989
-(Kiley grunts)
-That's enough.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.508
Don't you ever
touch her again.

39:05.993 --> 39:07.302
Bitch.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.013
(grunting)

39:13.018 --> 39:14.726
KILEY: (crying)
Oh, my God.

39:17.263 --> 39:19.356
Told you this
would come in handy.

39:20.767 --> 39:21.983
(crying) Oh.

39:25.697 --> 39:26.921
(siren chirps)

39:26.940 --> 39:29.090
(Kiley speaking indistinctly)

39:29.109 --> 39:31.368
KILEY:
It's been happening
for a year or so.

39:34.264 --> 39:35.446
OFFICER:
Okay, thank you.

39:35.599 --> 39:37.665
We'll let you know
if we need anything else.

39:41.696 --> 39:43.004
Everything go okay?

39:43.957 --> 39:46.031
Yeah.

39:46.109 --> 39:48.051
They actually
listened to me this time.

39:49.963 --> 39:51.963
I guess it helps
to have video evidence.

39:52.039 --> 39:53.372
I'm glad.

39:53.392 --> 39:54.974
KILEY:
Thank you, Marjan.

39:56.636 --> 39:57.644
For everything.

39:59.898 --> 40:00.972
I don't know what to say.

40:01.124 --> 40:02.974
You don't have to say anything.

40:03.050 --> 40:04.684
It was the right thing to do.

40:04.760 --> 40:06.051
In my experience,

40:06.129 --> 40:08.488
that's never made anybody
do something before.

40:10.483 --> 40:12.892
You know how you
set out on the open road

40:12.969 --> 40:14.393
to find your true purpose?

40:14.471 --> 40:16.413
(scoffs) Yeah.

40:17.307 --> 40:19.490
I think you just found it.

40:19.643 --> 40:20.900
What's that?

40:20.919 --> 40:22.460
Rescuing people.

40:25.072 --> 40:27.298
You're my hero, Marjan.

40:40.497 --> 40:42.830
-Hey.
-Mind if I come in?

40:42.849 --> 40:44.757
Sure. I was just
having some tea.

40:44.834 --> 40:45.733
(Owen sighs)

40:46.761 --> 40:48.111
Carlos isn't around?

40:48.188 --> 40:50.447
No. Interesting timing,
actually.

40:50.523 --> 40:52.699
His mom took him out to dinner
about half an hour ago.

40:54.844 --> 40:56.286
What is that, Dad?

40:56.437 --> 40:58.705
Extra virgin olive oil
from Tuscany.

41:00.200 --> 41:03.501
I couldn't find an actual
olive branch at this hour.

41:05.355 --> 41:09.190
And it lowers your LDLs,
so there's that.

41:09.192 --> 41:10.783
You're gonna tell me
what kinda salad dressing

41:10.802 --> 41:11.951
I should have now, too?

41:12.028 --> 41:13.194
(Owen chuckles)

41:13.196 --> 41:14.453
I-I deserve that.

41:14.531 --> 41:17.198
Um, I wanted
to talk to you about

41:17.200 --> 41:19.642
how I've gone slightly overboard
with the wedding planning.

41:19.794 --> 41:20.977
Slightly overboard?

41:21.054 --> 41:23.354
Leo went less overboard
on the<i> Titanic.</i>

41:23.815 --> 41:24.981
I admit it.

41:25.208 --> 41:26.483
I've been insufferable.

41:27.894 --> 41:29.377
I thought I was
doing it for you,

41:29.395 --> 41:32.304
but mostly
I was doing it for me.

41:32.382 --> 41:34.306
For what? To show off?

41:34.384 --> 41:36.308
'Cause, look, we're not
gonna get on the cover
of<i> Bridal Magazine</i>

41:36.328 --> 41:37.827
no matter how amazing
the wedding is.

41:37.904 --> 41:38.936
Oh, no, no.
You're wrong about that.

41:39.088 --> 41:40.221
<i> Bridal Magazine</i>
is often featuring

41:40.240 --> 41:42.373
same-sex couples
as long as the taste level--

41:43.893 --> 41:45.243
It's beside the point.

41:45.319 --> 41:47.045
I was not doing it to show off.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.088
So why were you?

41:52.511 --> 41:56.161
Because it's the last thing
you're ever gonna need from me.

41:56.239 --> 41:58.163
And so I wanted it
to be perfect.

41:58.241 --> 41:59.665
What are you talking about?

41:59.684 --> 42:03.019
You're marrying a guy
who's capable and decent,

42:03.246 --> 42:05.246
wonderful, and he's gonna
take great care of you.

42:05.265 --> 42:08.316
So my job's basically over.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.027
You wish, Dad. Alright?

42:11.178 --> 42:13.178
I don't know the first thing
about being married.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.513
Well, neither do I.
I'm 0 and 2.

42:14.533 --> 42:15.439
You know what I mean?

42:15.733 --> 42:17.182
It's not like I was
an amazing husband.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.685
Yeah, I guess, but...

42:19.704 --> 42:21.445
you are an amazing father.

42:21.598 --> 42:23.188
And one day
I hope to be one, too.

42:23.266 --> 42:26.117
So I'm gonna need
your help and guidance.

42:26.193 --> 42:28.269
That would be so cool.

42:28.271 --> 42:30.605
And I'm always gonna
need my best friend, okay?

42:30.607 --> 42:34.092
I just, I don't need you to make
everything perfect for me.

42:36.245 --> 42:38.221
-Deal.
-Deal.

42:39.299 --> 42:40.298
Would you like
some green tea?

42:40.450 --> 42:42.475
-Ooh, yes, please.
-Okay.

42:43.636 --> 42:45.453
Uh...

42:45.471 --> 42:48.806
Hey, son, You don't always
keep the bag in the cup, do you?

42:48.958 --> 42:49.882
Yeah. Why?

42:49.901 --> 42:51.884
Well, it makes the tea acidic

42:51.961 --> 42:53.361
and it stains your teeth.

42:54.130 --> 42:55.797
Here we go.

42:55.815 --> 42:57.532
Have I taught you nothing?
