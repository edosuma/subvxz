Did you know that we've been on the
phone for... 97 minutes?

01:16.160 --> 01:18.077
Well, I needed something
to pass the time

01:18.162 --> 01:20.079
before "The Pussycat Dolls"
comes on.

01:20.164 --> 01:21.414
You're obsessed, you know that?

01:21.498 --> 01:23.916
Hey, some people turn
to drugs or alcohol

01:24.001 --> 01:26.753
in times of sadness.
I myself have reality TV.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.546
- That's just weird.
- I know.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.256
Look, why don't you
come meet us tonight,

01:30.340 --> 01:32.425
celebrate with us
before we leave for Cannes?

01:32.509 --> 01:34.844
I'm not crashing a night out
with your guy friends.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.471
You wouldn't be crashing.
They've been dying to meet you.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.055
No, thank you, Eric.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.766
Look, do you really not want to go

01:39.850 --> 01:42.018
or do you just want to see
who gets kicked off?

01:42.102 --> 01:44.479
- I can't say.
- All right, compromise:

01:44.563 --> 01:46.564
Get the results, come meet us after.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.566
- Okay, fine.
- All right, great.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.067
I'll call you when
I know where we're going.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.361
Okay. Bye, Eric.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.155
All right, bye.

01:55.199 --> 01:56.657
How long have you guys
been standing there?

01:56.742 --> 01:59.577
- 97 minutes, E.
- Jesus.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.872
So what's all this chitchat about
between you and your clush anyway?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.791
- My what?
- Your clush... your client crush.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.210
- I like that.
- Funny how he always

02:07.294 --> 02:09.294
warned me about mixing
business with pleasure.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.130
I was trying for pleasure first.

02:11.215 --> 02:13.216
Aha! He's admitting to it.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.718
No one's hiding anything.
I like her. She's cool.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.637
- So don't hit on her.
Hey, come on.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.388
Who would do that?

02:19.723 --> 02:21.599
Excuse me.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.815
- Look at you. How are you doing?
- Hey.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.316
Good to see you.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.276
Don't think about kissing me, Turtle.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.820
What's up, Sam? How are you doing?

02:33.904 --> 02:36.322
Sammy, the place is
looking good, bro.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.324
Congrats on Cannes, babe.
Why don't you guys

02:38.408 --> 02:40.326
go grab our table
and hang out the rest of the night?

02:40.410 --> 02:42.495
- Are the drinks on your tab too?
- The way you drink, Drama,

02:42.579 --> 02:44.413
it's like giving Turtle
here keys to a whorehouse.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.415
Oh, come on, you cut me deep, man.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.167
Thank you, Sam. I appreciate it.

02:48.252 --> 02:50.503
- Yo, yo, yo, yo! The boys are here.
- What's up, kids?

02:50.587 --> 02:52.505
Nobody told me Walsh was coming.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.966
I didn't want to hear you complain.
Hey, how is it going, Billy?

02:55.050 --> 02:58.052
Great. I'm great, though spending
30 minutes alone with this guy

02:58.136 --> 03:00.304
is sort of painful. You know
he's bringing his wife to Cannes?

03:00.430 --> 03:02.932
No. Bringing your wife?
It's supposed to be a boys' trip.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.225
Vinnie, when you get married,
you realize

03:04.309 --> 03:05.643
that a wife is like a herpes sore...

03:05.727 --> 03:07.562
She comes and goes
when and where she pleases.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.398
Get some VALTREX, 'cause the rest
of us are gonna be yachting

03:10.482 --> 03:12.692
and boozing it up
with bronze-looking broads.

03:12.776 --> 03:15.862
I'm already preparing myself
by working on my foreign speak:

03:15.946 --> 03:17.738
"J'ai dirige ce film.

03:17.823 --> 03:20.324
- Voulez-vous avoir le sex?"
- What does that mean?

03:20.409 --> 03:22.326
It means,
"I directed this film. Wanna fuck?"

03:22.411 --> 03:24.412
Oh, Billy.

03:25.122 --> 03:28.332
- Hilarious.
- Stop kissing my ass, Drama.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.876
To the bar, come on.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.670
- They like each other, huh?
- Yep.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.255
And I heard
you really liked Walsh's script.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.339
So?

03:35.424 --> 03:37.383
So do you really like it
or are you just trying not to get

03:37.467 --> 03:38.801
completely pushed out
of the project?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.761
- Fuck off, Ari.
- Did you really like it?

03:40.846 --> 03:42.722
I hated it, but the guy
already committed to doing it.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.181
I'm just trying to be positive.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.516
Wow. After five years

03:45.601 --> 03:47.727
you finally learned how to lie.
Welcome to Hollywood.

03:47.811 --> 03:51.063
- Hey, double suits, get in here.
- All right.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.899
To the time of our lives

03:52.983 --> 03:54.901
we'll all soon be having in Cannes.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.652
Yes, sir.
- Except Ari.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.325
There's Anna.

04:02.534 --> 04:05.161
- You know Anna Faris?
- Yeah, she's E's new client.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.914
Nice. Love Anna Faris.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.749
Introduce me, Suit.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.670
What do you want me to say?
He wants her in the movie.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.797
- As what?
- My brother.

04:16.882 --> 04:17.923
As your brother?

04:18.007 --> 04:20.091
I was hoping I'd get a shot
at your brother, bro.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.762
No, after meeting Anna he decided
to change the part to my sister.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.056
- That's ridiculous, Vince.
- Beyond ridiculous.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.058
No, it's not. He wants to add
some lightness to the movie.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.477
- I can be light.
- And I already told him

04:29.811 --> 04:31.562
he's not allowed to hit on her,
so don't worry about it.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.272
- I'm not worried about that.
- Good.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.149
So we'll set a lunch
for the four of us, okay?

04:35.233 --> 04:36.233
Okay.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.152
Hey, guys, I think
we should cancel the trip.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.529
- Why?
- It's the news.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.157
The attorney general did not get

04:43.241 --> 04:45.242
into the specific details
concerning the elevation

04:45.327 --> 04:48.287
of the Administration's
terrorist attack advisory alert to red...

04:48.372 --> 04:51.582
Wow. Tough break, baby.
I guess you're not going.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.293
Well, I gotta go.
Cannes is work for me, so...

04:54.378 --> 04:55.962
Don't start, Ari.

04:56.046 --> 04:59.173
Baby, we are parents now. We have
a responsibility to our children.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.967
You know how much
I hate flying together.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.969
Well, with this looming
threat hanging over us

05:03.053 --> 05:04.637
it would just be irresponsible.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.389
Why don't you just say that
you don't want me to go?

05:06.473 --> 05:08.724
I don't want... I don't want our
children to be orphaned.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.686
That's very sweet, Ari.
And you know what? I won't go.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.521
You're actually not gonna go?

05:13.605 --> 05:15.898
No, seriously.
I didn't really want to go anyway.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.317
You don't want to go to Cannes?

05:18.402 --> 05:20.861
Do you think I care that much
about the film festival? I don't.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.614
And there are a ton of things around
here that I could be doing.

05:23.699 --> 05:24.949
- Really?
- Really.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.868
- You're not mad?
- No, I'm not. I'm fine.

05:28.412 --> 05:31.414
You're the finest woman
a man could ever not have with him.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.546
I think it would
be a mistake for terrorists

05:38.630 --> 05:40.172
to try and take over
any plane that I'm on

05:40.799 --> 05:43.759
'cause let's just say
I'm always ready to roll.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.511
Could we stop talking
about this, please?

05:45.595 --> 05:47.346
It's really just
that you're afraid of flying, Turtle.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.515
I don't think the terrorist
alert has anything to do with it.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.143
I'm not afraid of flying, Vince.
I'm afraid of crashing.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.603
I think he's afraid of flying
commercial, is his real problem.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.897
Is it so bad to long for a private jet?

05:56.982 --> 05:59.942
- No lines, no delays, no shoe bombs...
No money.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.194
A private jet to Cannes is
100 Gs each way, Turtle.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.613
How can you put a price
tag on personal safety, E?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.574
Johnny, just give him
one of your Xanax already.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.951
I will not. Nobody traveling with me

06:09.036 --> 06:11.078
takes a tranquilizer
till we've arrived.

06:11.163 --> 06:13.497
- Why?
- In case anything goes down

06:13.582 --> 06:16.542
we need all the manpower alert,
not comfortably numb.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.794
Jesus, looks like downtown Baghdad.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.379
That's good... Lots ofsecurity.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.339
Yeah, no one's blowing up in Baghdad.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.633
There's Billy.
Great.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.137
- What's up, Billy?
- Hey.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.931
The plane's been
delayed three hours.

06:31.183 --> 06:33.684
What? Why? Is there a bomb scare?

06:33.769 --> 06:35.394
No, Turtle,
I'm sure it's just so that they can

06:35.479 --> 06:36.854
check everything more carefully.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.272
No, actually there is a scare, Vince.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.149
Turns out it's specific to L.A.X.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.400
Jesus.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.736
Can you imagine if we went down
on the way to Cannes, though?

06:43.820 --> 06:46.238
- We'd be remembered forever.
- Yeah, not all of us would be.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.783
Yeah, but the three of us would be.

06:49.201 --> 06:51.410
You know, I used to fear
traveling with you, baby bro.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.412
I thought if we crashed
the press would say,

06:53.497 --> 06:55.289
"Vincent Chase And Brother Perish. "

06:55.373 --> 06:57.958
But now with a hit TV show
I'm quite certain they would say,

06:58.043 --> 06:59.877
"The Chase Brothers Perish. "

06:59.961 --> 07:02.046
Fuck, I'm ready for whatever happens.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.464
So what should we do
for the next three hours

07:03.548 --> 07:05.800
- besides celebrate your obituary?
- Run.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.426
I was thinking we'd go meet with Anna,

07:07.511 --> 07:08.969
talk about getting her in this film.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.388
- I set a lunch for next week.
- So move it up.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.266
I want to get her hooked
so I can start rewriting on the trip.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.643
I don't know where she is, Billy.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.646
Call her and tell her that Billy
Walsh has got a movie role for her.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.648
I'm quite sure she'll come a-running.

07:20.732 --> 07:23.442
Yeah, why put off till tomorrow what
you can accomplish today?

07:23.527 --> 07:25.277
All right, I'll see where she's at.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.321
- What about us?
- You can come.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.864
No, me and Turtle
ain't going nowhere.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.199
Oh, we're not?

07:30.283 --> 07:32.493
No, we're gonna sweep
this entire airport

07:32.577 --> 07:34.578
for suspicious
and unsavory characters.

07:34.663 --> 07:35.704
Get out of here.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.165
Look, Turtle, you're getting on that
plane in three hours either way,

07:38.250 --> 07:39.708
so would you rather seek out
terrorist scum

07:39.793 --> 07:42.461
here on the ground now
or 35,000 feet later?

07:43.547 --> 07:44.547
Fine.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.132
Yo, we're on. Let's go.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.134
Hey, and seek out Ari too.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.678
He's gotta be
around here somewhere.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.639
I confirmed 30 minutes ago
and no one said a word.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.641
- Sir, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

07:55.725 --> 07:57.935
Tell that to my work that's not
getting done that could have been

07:58.019 --> 08:00.604
getting done if I knew
I had three hours that you're sorry.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.815
Sir, this has been
an extraordinary day.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.151
- We're at code red.
- Please, come on.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.945
We're at code red every time the
president has a loose stool.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.364
Sir, may I suggest
you lower your voice

08:10.448 --> 08:12.616
before a National Guardsman
mistakes it for a threat

08:12.701 --> 08:15.244
and inadvertently shoots you?

08:16.204 --> 08:18.038
My plane's been delayed
for three hours, Lloyd.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.832
And your wife is not going to Cannes.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.542
Oh yeah? So what? How do you know?

08:21.626 --> 08:24.044
- I spoke to her, Ari.
- You did? Why? What'd she say?

08:24.171 --> 08:26.380
She's fine with not going, right?
She said she's fine.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.341
"Fine" is not fine, Ari,
not when it comes from a woman's mouth.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.385
So no, she's not fine.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.554
And somebody else is also not fine.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.556
- Oh yeah? Who?
- Me.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.265
What's your problem?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.727
You said if your wife
didn't go to Cannes, that I could.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.895
- When did I say that?
- When you said

08:41.980 --> 08:43.522
it wasn't time for me
to get promoted yet.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.275
You know what, Lloyd?
I'm in the middle of a code-red alert.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.277
We've got military police everywhere,

08:48.361 --> 08:50.446
German shepherds
ready to attack at a moment's notice.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.239
I'm facing three-hour delays

08:52.324 --> 08:54.325
and an uncertain, unsafe future,

08:54.409 --> 08:57.536
so get off my ass and go get
my wife her favorite flowers.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.164
- Do you even know what those are?
- No, but you do.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.916
Remember that. And remember

09:02.000 --> 09:04.335
I also know what my favorite
Teuscher chocolate truffles are.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.003
Send yourself a box, Lloyd.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.714
Okay, but this discussion
is not over yet, Ari.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.341
Yeah, it is.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.885
I need this role to be self-aware,

09:12.969 --> 09:17.056
but with a subconscious lack of
understanding. You understand?

09:18.141 --> 09:20.142
Not totally. Is that bad?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.852
When you read it, Anna,
you'll understand.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.188
Exactly.
I express myself better when I write.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.566
The important thing
is that I've seen "Scary Movie" 10 times

09:28.151 --> 09:29.985
and I know you can bring it for me.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.737
- Really?
- Really.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.656
Is he being serious?

09:33.740 --> 09:35.824
Because I can't tell
if he's making fun of me.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.161
- What's wrong with "Scary Movie"?
- I love "Scary Movie. "

09:39.246 --> 09:41.580
It just doesn't seem
like it'd be your thing.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.500
What do you think my thing would be?

09:45.126 --> 09:46.710
"Blue Velvet" maybe,

09:46.795 --> 09:50.005
or "Henry: Portrait
of a Serial Killer. "

09:50.090 --> 09:51.840
I've seen them both 20 times also.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.176
I'm a cinephile and I see everything.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.761
I've seen
"Lost in Translation" and loved it.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.763
And I've seen "Just Friends"...
I loved it too.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.474
I see a contrast in you and me

10:00.892 --> 10:04.853
that I think would work
perfectly for this film.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.524
And I would be honored
if you just gave it a read.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.369
Ah, there's a good-looking
group, huh?

10:20.870 --> 10:22.997
And I do feel safe with nuns.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.124
- Not me.
- Oh, come on.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.959
God wouldn't take down
a plane full of nuns.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.377
I gotta believe in at least that much.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.547
I believe it too, Turtle,
but what if they're not nuns?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.299
What else would they be?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.301
What, you don't
think it's odd that a group of nuns

10:35.385 --> 10:36.719
is traveling to the South of France?

10:36.886 --> 10:39.179
Since when can't nuns
vacation, Drama?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.598
They can, but just not
to places like Cannes

10:41.683 --> 10:43.600
in the biggest party
season of the year

10:43.685 --> 10:45.561
where girls
roam the streets topless.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.646
Maybe it's a missionary trip
and they're there

10:47.731 --> 10:50.024
- to convince the girls to cover up.
- Maybe.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.651
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

10:52.736 --> 10:55.321
I'm fine with the nuns.
It's this guy that scares me.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.573
No profiling, Turtle. I don't believe it.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.409
Have you seen "24," Drama?
'Cause I have.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.079
- All right, let's make a move.
- What kind of move?

11:04.914 --> 11:06.373
The same kind of move I made

11:06.458 --> 11:08.334
when I was terrified
of Pete Minetto in high school...

11:08.418 --> 11:10.169
we befriend him, make him love us.

11:10.253 --> 11:13.005
That way when he seizes the plane
and starts executing people

11:13.506 --> 11:14.590
he let's us go free.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.800
I don't want to befriend him.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.928
Then I'm gonna
feel no guilt if I survive.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.934
Are these seats taken, my friend?

11:26.269 --> 11:27.436
Great.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.607
I'm Johnny. This is Turtle.

11:31.775 --> 11:32.858
Oh, and this is Ari.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.777
Ari...

11:36.488 --> 11:37.946
Ari's fucked.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.325
I'm an actor. What do you do?

11:41.659 --> 11:43.494
MRS. ARl: I'm fine.
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.662
If you're fine,
why are you out shopping for cars?

11:46.122 --> 11:47.831
What does one thing
have to do with the other?

11:47.916 --> 11:50.417
I want a new car. What, I can't have
a new car if I want a new car?

11:50.502 --> 11:52.711
- It's my money also, Ari.
- You can have a new car, baby.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.380
Just calm down. I'm just
saying you might want to go home

11:54.464 --> 11:55.464
because there are probably some

11:55.548 --> 11:56.715
beautiful new flowers
waiting for you.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.134
Why are you sending me flowers? Are
you feeling guilty about something?

11:59.219 --> 12:02.888
I'm not feeling guilty, baby. You're
happy. You're fine with not going.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.515
And you're happy I'm not going.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.892
- Baby...
- How much are the Maybachs?

12:06.976 --> 12:10.687
- I'll call you back, Ari.
For rescheduling.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.023
Again, ladies and gentlemen...

12:13.108 --> 12:16.151
You gotta be shitting me.

12:17.112 --> 12:19.238
- Baby...
- This is not your baby, Ari.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.281
This is your
underappreciated assistant.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.659
- What do you want, Lloyd?
- I spoke to my therapist

12:23.743 --> 12:25.661
and he said
I should not hide what I'm feeling.

12:25.745 --> 12:29.164
I should express to you my hurt and
disappointment about not going.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.833
Well, now that you've
expressed that,

12:30.917 --> 12:33.919
let me express my frustration
that my flight has been canceled.

12:34.003 --> 12:37.256
Maybe this is karma.
Perhaps you should do something

12:37.340 --> 12:39.341
to turn it before
something really bad happens.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.051
Today, Lloyd? Under code red?

12:41.136 --> 12:42.886
I'm sorry, Ari. That was wrong.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.721
Yeah, it was. Now listen,

12:44.806 --> 12:47.307
Call my boy Kenny Dichter
over at Marquis Jets,

12:47.392 --> 12:49.560
see if me and the boys
can hop on a flight today.

12:49.644 --> 12:52.354
- You're gonna fly private?
- Just do it.

12:52.647 --> 12:56.275
Maybe in France we'll hit
the restaurant of your choice, on us.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.652
The flight's canceled.
Let's get the hell out of here.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.612
Really? That's awesome.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.491
How do I get in touch with you?

13:04.576 --> 13:06.618
You don't. If it's meant to be

13:06.703 --> 13:09.455
we'll run into each other.
Be well, my friend.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.957
That girl is wife material...

13:12.041 --> 13:14.293
Wife, mother,
grow-old-together material.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.502
Too bad you have a girlfriend.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.671
Yeah, Billy. You did
promise you wouldn't hit on her.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.299
I'm talking in terms of
presence for the film, Vince.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.259
The sister has to have that thing

13:22.343 --> 13:25.095
that you just adore at all times
in order for her to be able

13:25.180 --> 13:27.347
to get away with some of the more
vicious things that she does.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.433
Speaking of which,
you could have come to my defense

13:29.517 --> 13:31.643
just a little when she was
quizzing me back there, Suit.

13:31.728 --> 13:32.728
Your defense?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.438
Yeah, she's asking me some
pretty tough questions,

13:34.522 --> 13:36.231
you're just sitting there
like you got your tongue cut out.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.484
You were talking the whole time,
Billy. What did you want me to say?

13:38.568 --> 13:40.861
Anna did look at you
a couple of times for reassurance

13:40.945 --> 13:42.112
and you didn't give her much.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.405
That's 'cause I'm in
an awkward position.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.157
I'm her manager
but I'm also a producer on this.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.659
Eh, it's a no-show-type
job title anyway.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.786
Look, I don't want to jam it
down her throat, Vince.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.830
Plus, it doesn't really matter.
She's got the script,

13:51.915 --> 13:53.624
she loved Billy,
so what do you want me to say?

13:53.708 --> 13:56.502
You think she loved me, Suit?

13:56.586 --> 13:59.421
- Hey, what's up, Turtle?
- Yo, E, our flight's canceled.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.715
- What?
- The whole airport's shut down.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.092
All right, we'll meet you
back at the house.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.762
L.A.X. Is closed.
There's no flights leaving today.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.388
- Jesus.
- What?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.183
I couldn't bear
going without you, baby.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.936
Ari, I know they closed the airport.
It's all over the news,

14:14.020 --> 14:16.104
so stop making it
like it's some grand gesture.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.191
Baby, what did we learn about
being passive-aggressive in therapy?

14:19.275 --> 14:22.528
If you wanted to go you should have
not said "I don't want to go. "

14:22.612 --> 14:24.696
I'm tired of feeling
like I'm not wanted, Ari.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.741
Baby, what are you talking about?
This is a one-time thing.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.660
Ari, you came home last night
and you said

14:29.744 --> 14:31.870
that the hotel had screwed us
out of a king-sized bed

14:31.955 --> 14:33.705
and would I "really be
comfortable in a single?"

14:33.790 --> 14:35.374
And then this morning
before the news came on

14:35.458 --> 14:37.167
you said
that Brian Sher's wife wasn't going

14:37.252 --> 14:39.753
and if she found out
that I was going, she would go crazy.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.755
Ari, there are some men
that would kill to go

14:41.839 --> 14:44.007
to the South of France
with me and if you're not one of them...

14:44.092 --> 14:46.843
I am one of them, honey.
I'm glad that the flight was canceled,

14:46.928 --> 14:49.721
so now I can tell you
I want you to go.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.515
I don't want to go without you

14:51.599 --> 14:54.393
and I love you. Now will you go?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.937
- No, Ari, I won't.
- Why not?

14:57.272 --> 14:59.773
Well, because all that will
do is assuage your guilt.

15:00.650 --> 15:01.900
Why would you want to do that?

15:01.985 --> 15:04.903
- Well, Ari, you shouldn't feel guilty.
- What should I feel?

15:04.988 --> 15:06.488
Sadness that for some reason

15:06.573 --> 15:08.949
you're married to someone
you don't like to be with.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.119
Laura, I'll definitely
need some help upstairs.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.162
Hello, Lloyd.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.081
Hello, Ari.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.666
You're not my mistress.
Stop being mad at me.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.750
I'm no longer mad.

15:18.835 --> 15:19.835
Well, you shouldn't be, Lloyd,

15:19.919 --> 15:20.919
because I'd love
to have you in Cannes.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.254
So go home,
pack your favorite sarong

15:22.338 --> 15:23.422
and consider yourself invited.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.757
- Are you serious, Ari?
- I'm so serious

15:25.842 --> 15:27.759
that I'm actually
embarrassed for myself.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.428
- That's very sweet of you, Ari.
- It's not that sweet,

15:29.512 --> 15:31.763
'cause I don't want to see you
when I'm there. This is a man's trip,

15:31.848 --> 15:34.016
so you're gonna have to
find your own dick clique.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.184
That is fine, Ari. Oh my God.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.605
I'm so happy.
But how are we getting there?

15:39.689 --> 15:42.441
- You called Kenny D., right?
- He says there are no jets.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.109
The whole town
is scrambling since the alert

15:44.193 --> 15:45.277
and you scrambled too late.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.738
- There's not one more plane?
- There was one,

15:47.864 --> 15:49.531
but Sydney Pollack just booked it.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.699
Fuck!

15:51.159 --> 15:53.118
The airline said
that they can't guarantee

15:53.202 --> 15:55.412
that we can get
on a flight tomorrow? This is unreal.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.081
My travel lady says
we could drive to Phoenix,

15:58.166 --> 16:01.418
get on a flight to St. Louis
and then hop on a flight to France.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.712
- Sounds miserable.
Beyond miserable.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.173
This is insane.
"Medellin" premieres in 48 hours.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.883
- We may not make it.
- We'll make it.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.469
Ari will take care of it, I'm sure.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.471
- Hey, what's up, Anna?
- Oh, hey.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.389
I thought you'd be on a plane.
I was gonna leave a message.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.058
No, everything got canceled.
Turn on the news.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.018
Oh, I'm sorry. That sucks.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.645
What's going on?

16:19.729 --> 16:21.146
Um, it's about Billy's script.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.481
Yeah?

16:22.565 --> 16:24.524
Yeah. Can I speak freely?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.693
Of course. What's going on?

16:26.778 --> 16:28.320
I don't get it.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.076
It's Sydney Pollack returning.
My fingers are all crossed.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.787
Is this my dear old friend Sydney?

16:36.871 --> 16:39.498
I told you when I fired you
we weren't friends, Ari.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.333
You consider that a firing, Sydney?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.210
I like to look back at it

16:43.294 --> 16:44.920
as an amicable parting of the ways.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.673
I'm not coming back, okay?
You understand the word "never"?

16:47.757 --> 16:49.508
Well, you just keep thinking about it

16:49.592 --> 16:51.677
because this is not
a business call, this is personal.

16:51.761 --> 16:55.847
I need a lift to Cannes. I heard you
got the last plane out of Marquis

16:55.932 --> 16:57.891
and I've got to get Vinnie Chase
and the "Medellin" crew

16:57.975 --> 16:58.975
there by tomorrow.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.937
"Medellin"... you know,
I hear a lot of hype about that film.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.855
It's phenomenal.
It's absolutely phenomenal.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.692
I'm not completely sold
on that kid of yours yet.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.527
After a plane ride and a screening

17:08.611 --> 17:10.319
you'll see him as the next Redford.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.446
You want to do
a "Three Days of the Condor" sequel?

17:12.573 --> 17:14.199
No.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.034
I wouldn't mind meeting him, though.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.537
You know, maybe something
would come up.

17:18.621 --> 17:21.540
- Yeah?
- Okay, Ari, I'll give you a lift,

17:21.624 --> 17:23.375
as long as I don't sit next to you.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.667
I'll ride in the bathroom.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.503
- How many you got?
- Uh, six.

17:27.755 --> 17:31.550
I can't take six. I can do maybe
five, and that's gonna be tight.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.720
We'll make do.
Listen, I still love you, Sydney.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.347
6:30 sharp at Van Nuys. Goodbye, Ari.

17:38.683 --> 17:41.685
Lloyd, Lloyd, come on.
It was a numbers thing.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.311
You heard... I couldn't
have done anything.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.313
- Where are you going?
- To unpack.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.816
Unpack?
You couldn't have even packed yet.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.528
In my mind, I did, Ari. In my mind, I did.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.280
It's not my fault
she doesn't get it, Vince.

17:53.364 --> 17:55.407
But it is your fault
if you don't try and help her to.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.700
What do you want me to say?

17:56.784 --> 17:58.410
I want you to say that
you're gonna go convince her

17:58.494 --> 18:00.370
that she should do the movie,
because that's what

18:00.455 --> 18:03.415
your director wants,
and as a producer, that is your job.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.708
It's your job, E.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.334
How would you like me to try
to convince her, Vince?

18:06.836 --> 18:08.754
Tell her how great
you think it's gonna be.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.255
That's what she wants to hear.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.965
What if I don't think
it's gonna be great? What then?

18:12.049 --> 18:14.259
Should I lie to her? 'cause that's not
what a manager does.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.761
Hey, you lied to me.

18:15.845 --> 18:19.097
What, you don't think
I know you don't like it?

18:19.182 --> 18:20.932
I don't know, because you
never asked for my opinion

18:21.017 --> 18:22.100
before you agreed to do the movie.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.310
That's because you hate Billy

18:23.394 --> 18:25.645
and I knew there was no way you were
gonna read it with an open mind.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.355
What, you're a
mind-reader now, Vince?

18:27.648 --> 18:29.441
E, you asked me
if I thought it was okay

18:29.525 --> 18:31.943
if you sign
Anna as a client and I said one thing:

18:32.028 --> 18:34.279
"Just make sure
it doesn't affect my career. "

18:34.363 --> 18:37.449
This is the movie I'm making and this is
who I want to be in the movie.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.451
And I really believe
it's gonna be a great movie

18:39.535 --> 18:40.786
and she's gonna be great in it.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.788
I need you to believe that
and try to make this happen.

18:42.872 --> 18:43.872
And if I can't?

18:43.956 --> 18:45.791
At least make me
believe that you tried.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.127
Hey, Ari called. He said we have to
be at the airport in three hours.

18:49.212 --> 18:50.670
- How are we getting there?
- Sydney Pollack's

18:50.755 --> 18:52.756
giving us a lift on his G-IV.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.300
Sydney Pollack? Sweet.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.385
I told you it was gonna work out.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.262
It always does, right?

18:59.347 --> 19:00.931
So do you
really like the script?

19:01.015 --> 19:01.973
You really hate it?

19:02.058 --> 19:04.726
No, I don't hate it. I'm unsure.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.728
You know, it's confusing.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.897
I'm really looking
for some guidance here, E.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.649
Yeah, well, maybe
you should give it another read.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.612
"Leopold furiously cooks breakfast.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.448
Curtis enters and Leopold,
overcome by his presence,

19:18.533 --> 19:20.867
sears his hand
over the hot sizzling bacon.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.869
Curtis begins to weep. "

19:23.579 --> 19:25.914
- It's written in haiku.
- The guy's an original.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.667
I'm a little surprised
we're off on this.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.752
Maybe it's just
my head space right now.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.879
But if you think I should do it...

19:32.964 --> 19:35.215
Do you think I should do it?
I really trust your opinion.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.176
I think Billy's gonna
make a great movie.

19:38.261 --> 19:39.594
So you were happy with
what he did on "Medellin"?

19:41.597 --> 19:42.973
It got into Cannes.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.935
Okay, I'll do it.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.104
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.690
I'm sure Billy and Vince
will be happy to hear that.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.149
So do you have to go to the airport?

19:53.234 --> 19:54.943
Yeah, the flight leaves at 6:30.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.696
Oh, you've got some time.
Do you want a drink?

19:57.780 --> 19:59.197
Sounds good.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.411
Well, I think I'm excited.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.622
You know, I'm excited
to start a new movie

20:07.707 --> 20:10.250
and to be free
from my loser boyfriend.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.627
You don't sound
completely convinced.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.005
Well, when you break up it's tough.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.965
It's weird. I was with Dave for so long

20:17.049 --> 20:20.802
that I've completely shut off
any possibility of somebody else.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.512
Fortunately,
you're not gonna have to do much.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.556
Once people find out you're single,
they're gonna be lining up.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.765
Oh.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.602
I'm gonna tell you something
that's completely embarrassing,

20:28.686 --> 20:29.769
but that'll cheer you up.

20:29.854 --> 20:30.896
Yeah?

20:30.980 --> 20:32.606
When we first met,
I thought you were cute.

20:32.690 --> 20:33.940
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.234
And I thought
our first dinner was a date.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.403
- Oh my god, are you serious?
- Yeah.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.655
Oh, I'm such an asshole.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.157
No. No.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.909
So you don't hate me for it?

20:43.993 --> 20:46.328
- No, I'm happy to be working with you.
- Me too.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.580
And I'm glad you've become
a good friend.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.041
And I thought you were cute too

20:51.125 --> 20:52.626
when I crashed into you.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.210
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:55.922 --> 21:01.051
What?

21:02.178 --> 21:04.220
I don't really like
Billy's script, Anna.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.016
I don't understand.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.648
Welcome to Marquis Jet, gentlemen.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.858
And a very warm welcome it is.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.444
Will you ladies be
joining us on our trip to France?

21:19.528 --> 21:21.738
No, but you'll be in their good hands.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.740
Hi, Vince.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.867
The friendly skies at last.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.121
Somebody grab my fucking luggage.

21:30.498 --> 21:31.998
You got a lot of bags, Billy?

21:32.375 --> 21:35.377
I like a lot of wardrobe choices
too when traveling abroad.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.462
I got one bag, Drama, you fruit cup,

21:37.546 --> 21:40.382
but I took three Ambiens
and I can't lift my arms.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.467
- Hey, what's up?
- Fruit cup.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.552
There they are, boys of "Medellin. "

21:45.221 --> 21:47.263
I want you all to say hello
to Mr. Sydney Pollack.

21:47.348 --> 21:48.890
Hey, Sydney. Big fan.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.184
Me too, Vince.
Pleasure to have you guys.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.353
Pleasure to be had, Sydney.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.021
In fact, I've been dying to meet you

21:55.106 --> 21:56.606
ever since I played the Redford role

21:56.691 --> 21:58.400
in "The Way We Were" off-Broadway.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.069
- You played that part?
- Yeah. You don't see it?

22:01.529 --> 22:03.113
- Uh, well...
- Are we ready to go?

22:03.197 --> 22:05.198
No, actually,
we're waiting for one more.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.325
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute. Five... we said five.

22:07.410 --> 22:10.662
Uh, I miscalculated,
but it is no problem.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.039
We'll take the late little man
and put him in the overhead.

22:13.124 --> 22:15.041
Every passenger
has to have their own seat, sir.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.292
That's F.A.A. Regulations.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.503
Ari, rules. Come on,

22:18.587 --> 22:20.338
I got my eight people to take care of.

22:20.423 --> 22:22.173
You guys work it out
and we'll see you on the plane.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.634
- I'm sorry about that, Vince.
- Hey, no problem.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.264
What the hell, Ari?

22:29.348 --> 22:30.890
No one said
an agent could count.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.727
I screwed up, okay?
But I can remedy this situation.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.688
Everyone that does not
have a purpose in Cannes, say "Aye. "

22:36.772 --> 22:38.481
Turtle, Drama, don't hold back.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.233
Hey, I have a purpose there, Ari...

22:40.317 --> 22:42.694
To raise the awareness
of Johnny Chase...

22:42.778 --> 22:44.529
A purpose that also
translates to cash

22:44.613 --> 22:46.322
in the Miller-Gold pockets,
I might add.

22:46.407 --> 22:49.451
Look, guys, Drama's right. He has
more of a purpose there than me.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.077
I'll stay back. It's cool. Don't worry.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.121
- Boom.
- Oh, great. Now I feel terrible.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.290
- It's fine.
- Nobody's hanging back

22:55.374 --> 22:57.250
or everybody's hanging back, okay?

22:57.334 --> 22:59.210
Vinnie, what are you talking about?
You bled for this thing.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.880
- You've gotta go. It's your movie.
- We all bled for it, Ari.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.340
We'll get another plane tomorrow,
'cause tonight it's all or none.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.968
- There may not be a plane tomorrow.
- Billy, why don't you go?

23:08.054 --> 23:10.013
Eh, fuck it. I'm a team player.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.515
Look, I will bail.
I gotta salvage a marriage anyway.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.558
Don't worry about it.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.560
No, no, "all or none of us"
includes you, Ari.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.604
Excuse me, ladies,
would you mind telling Mr. Pollack

23:17.688 --> 23:19.564
that we're gonna have to
catch another ride?

23:19.648 --> 23:21.900
Hey, Vin, should we call E,
tell him not even to bother?

23:21.984 --> 23:23.818
Unless my triple vision's
getting the best of me,

23:23.903 --> 23:25.320
that looks like him right there.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.489
- Sorry I'm late, guys.
- You're not.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.908
We sacrificed the plane
to the god of friendship.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.076
What?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.702
Billy, if it's meant to be,
we'll get there.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.829
- How'd the meeting go?
- Not great.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.790
- So she's not gonna do it?
- No, she's not doing it.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.625
Good.
I was thinking I wanted to keep it.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.627
- As the brother anyway.
- Hello.

23:40.711 --> 23:42.921
Ari, since
you didn't want to sail the open seas with me,

23:43.005 --> 23:45.715
I'm taking Tom on a Rosie cruise
to Puerto Vallarta for a week.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.759
- Sounds good, Lloyd.
- We are on our way

23:47.843 --> 23:49.427
and I'm not even asking permission.

23:49.512 --> 23:52.347
All right. Listen, have a great
time, wear a life vest,

23:52.431 --> 23:54.641
'cause the only bobbing
you should be doing is on Tom's cock.

23:54.809 --> 23:55.892
Thanks, Ari.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.062
So what now, Ari?

23:59.230 --> 24:00.438
Turtle, what's up? How are you doing?

24:00.523 --> 24:01.606
Kanye, what's up, man?

24:01.690 --> 24:03.316
- How are you doing?
- I've been good.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.443
How does Turtle know Kanye?

24:05.653 --> 24:07.987
- Yo, what's up, Turtle?
- Kanye, Ari Gold. How are you?

24:08.072 --> 24:09.781
I called your manager
about you and I sitting down

24:09.865 --> 24:12.033
for a little meet-and-greet.
You know my boy Vinnie, right?

24:12.118 --> 24:13.868
Yeah, I know Vince.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.870
What's up, Kanye? How have you been?

24:15.955 --> 24:17.747
- Good. Where are you headed?
- Nowhere.

24:17.832 --> 24:19.791
We got no plane, man.
Where are you guys heading?

24:19.875 --> 24:21.918
We're going to London.
We're just chilling out for a second.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.586
How much room you got?

24:23.671 --> 24:25.463
We got a little room.

24:27.508 --> 24:29.342
Well, you feel like making
a quick stop in Cannes?

24:30.136 --> 24:31.302
Not really. I mean...

24:31.387 --> 24:33.138
You'd be really helping us out.

24:33.222 --> 24:34.681
Yeah, I mean, like...

24:34.765 --> 24:36.850
- Who do we know in Cannes?
- Everybody.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.643
Everybody's over there.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.104
- It would really mean a lot to us.
- Come on, Kanye.

24:41.188 --> 24:43.148
Well, I guess we're going to Cannes.

24:43.232 --> 24:45.942
Kanye to the rescue.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.325
Vinnie, go ahead.
I'm just gonna make a quick call.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.327
- To your wife?
- Yes. Leave no man behind.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.746
Put in a good word to Kanye for me.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.291
Hello.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.002
Baby, listen,
it's not that I didn't want you to go.

25:04.086 --> 25:05.670
I love you by my side always.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.256
It's just that I wanted to be
one of the boys for once

25:08.340 --> 25:09.924
with Vinnie and everyone. I just...

25:10.259 --> 25:12.719
I wanted to feel
young again, you know?

25:12.803 --> 25:14.512
But now I know that I don't

25:14.597 --> 25:16.639
and I want to feel my age with you.

25:18.142 --> 25:20.018
That's sort of a sweet sentiment, Ari.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.562
I want you to get down here.
Come on down, honey.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.899
Go on your boys' trip, Ari.
I understand.

25:25.983 --> 25:27.233
If you'd been honest
from the beginning,

25:27.318 --> 25:28.860
we would have been all good.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.612
- Really?
- Really.

25:30.905 --> 25:32.697
But I do want you to come.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.450
I know, and that's enough for me.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.952
- You're amazing.
- Thank you, Ari.

25:38.621 --> 25:40.788
Oh, and thank you
for all the lavish gifts.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.123
It was very thoughtful.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.833
You deserve it.

25:43.918 --> 25:45.710
Uh, how thoughtful was I?

25:46.545 --> 25:48.630
- Have a safe flight, Ari.
- I love you.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.636
- So she fired you?
- Yep.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.888
- Will she maybe still date you?
- Nope.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.681
Tough break.
- Sorry, E.

25:58.766 --> 26:00.808
She'll maybe still date me.

26:01.227 --> 26:04.646
- Bringing your wife, Ari?
- No, and I'm actually sad.

26:04.855 --> 26:06.564
Yo, what up, everybody? It's Kanye

26:06.649 --> 26:08.900
and we're getting
ready to take off in just a few minutes.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.485
And for those of you who don't know,

26:10.569 --> 26:12.362
I actually took flying lessons a week ago,

26:12.446 --> 26:14.239
and even though it's totally illegal,

26:14.323 --> 26:16.491
I'm gonna fly us out of here.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.745
Nah, I'm just fucking with you.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.414
I'm just fucking with you. We've got
some real old-school pilot,

26:23.499 --> 26:25.750
used to fly
Air Force One, extremely old.

26:25.834 --> 26:28.002
Actually, it might be his last flight.
He's gonna retire.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.630
And just a little heads up:
When you see the flight attendants

26:30.714 --> 26:32.423
coming down the aisle,
Mandy and Sandy,

26:32.508 --> 26:35.551
feel free to get a massage,
'cause it's crazy.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.637
It's crazy.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.847
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.392
I'm hot stone. She's shiatsu.

26:42.476 --> 26:45.103
- Can I freshen up your drink for you?
Yes, you can.

26:45.187 --> 26:47.605
- Still sad, Ari?
- Yeah,

26:47.690 --> 26:50.024
but I will get over it.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.234
- Cheers to that.
- Yeah.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.318
Cheers.

26:53.305 --> 26:59.444
