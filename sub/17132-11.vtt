WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:03.537
HEY, DID MY MOM CALL?

00:03.537 --> 00:06.307
NO, I THOUGHT
SHE CARPOOLED WITH YOU TODAY.

00:06.307 --> 00:09.643
OH, SHE DID, BUT SHE LIT
A CIGARETTE IN THE CAR AGAIN,

00:09.643 --> 00:12.146
SO I PULLED OVER,
AND I KICKED HER OUT.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.215
YOU LEFT YOUR MOM
IN THE STREET?

00:14.215 --> 00:17.351
NO, I SLOWED DOWN
SO SHE COULD GET BACK IN.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.620
THEN WHEN SHE GOT CLOSE,
I SPED UP AGAIN.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.856
THEN I SLOWED DOWN,
THEN I SPED UP.

00:22.856 --> 00:26.660
HEY, TELL HER ABOUT WHEN
YOUR MOM DOVE FOR THE BUMPER,

00:26.660 --> 00:30.331
RIGHT WHEN YOU HIT THE BRAKES,
IT WAS LIKE, BOOM! POW!

00:30.331 --> 00:31.932
THAT WAS ACCIDENTAL,

00:31.932 --> 00:34.034
BUT VERY FUNNY.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.369
(laughs)

00:35.369 --> 00:37.338
GEORGE,
SOME GUY CALLED FOR YOU.

00:37.338 --> 00:40.241
HE SAID HE WAS ONE
OF YOUR MOM'S BOYFRIENDS?

00:40.241 --> 00:42.243
WELL,
THAT COULD BE ANYBODY.

00:42.243 --> 00:45.246
I MEAN, MY MOM WAS
THE FAST FOOD OF DATING--

00:45.246 --> 00:47.481
EASY, CHEAP AND PERFECT
WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK.

00:47.481 --> 00:51.452
HEY, YEAH, SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE
WITH THE DOLLAR MENU.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.354
(laughs)

00:54.922 --> 00:57.425
HE SAID HIS NAME
IS WAYNE HILL?

00:57.425 --> 00:59.460
WAYNE HILL. OH, MAN!

00:59.460 --> 01:02.196
WELL, HE SAID HE'S SINGLE NOW,
AND HE'S COMING OVER

01:02.196 --> 01:05.899
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT BENNY.
AGAIN? I WISH THAT GUY WOULD
STOP TRYING TO USE ME

01:05.899 --> 01:09.002
TO SMOOTH THINGS OVER WITH HER.
WELL, THEN JUST GIVE HIM
YOUR MOM'S NUMBER.

01:09.002 --> 01:12.206
NO WAY. I'M NOT LETTING THAT GUY
ANYWHERE NEAR HER.

01:12.206 --> 01:15.176
I EVEN TOLD HIM
SHE LOST HER JOB AT THE FACTORY

01:15.176 --> 01:17.178
SO HE WOULDN'T TRY
TO CALL HER THERE.

01:17.178 --> 01:20.981
WHAT DID HE DO TO HER?
BROKE HER HEART, OR WHATEVER
SHE HAS THAT PUMPS BLOOD,

01:20.981 --> 01:22.983
TEQUILA AND ACID
THROUGH HER VEINS.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.885
YOU WERE THERE. REMEMBER?

01:24.885 --> 01:30.090
(imitating gunfire)

01:31.892 --> 01:33.827
OH. (laughs)

01:33.827 --> 01:36.063
(laughs) STOP. OH.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.666
GEORGE,
TAKE YOUR GIRLFRIEND

01:38.666 --> 01:40.868
AND GO PLAY DOLLS
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

01:43.604 --> 01:44.872
THEY'RE NOT DOLLS.

01:44.872 --> 01:48.809
THEY'RE G.I.s,
AND THEY'RE KICKING HIPPIE ASS.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.211
GOTTA GO, BABE.

01:50.211 --> 01:53.381
I GOTTA BE UP EARLY TO FILM
A COMMERCIAL FOR THE NEW STORE.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.583
OH, I FINALLY
HOOKED A WINNER.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.319
YOU ARE THE RENT-TO-OWN
FURNITURE KING.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.321
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY--

02:00.321 --> 02:02.890
"BEHIND EVERY GOOD MAN,
THERE'S A GOOD WOMAN...

02:02.890 --> 02:06.394
AND QUALITY FURNITURE
FOR JUST PENNIES A MONTH."

02:06.394 --> 02:08.696
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU MISS A PAYMENT.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.931
THEN I JACK UP
THE INTEREST 30%.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.566
OH.
SUCKERS.

02:12.566 --> 02:16.237
OH, DON'T TALK LIKE THAT
IF YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.071
(laughs)

02:18.071 --> 02:21.275
HEY, NEW WATER BEDS COMING IN.
MAYBE I'LL GET YOU ONE.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.644
(Benny squeals)
YOU, TOO, LITTLE MAN.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.680
OH, HE MAKES
HIS OWN WATER BED EVERY NIGHT.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.816
MOM!

02:30.984 --> 02:32.786
WHAT'S THAT?

02:32.786 --> 02:33.787
WHAT?

02:33.787 --> 02:35.856
HELLO.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.892
THERE'S SOMETHING
FALLING OUT OF YOUR POCKET.

02:38.892 --> 02:42.396
WHAT THE HELL?

02:45.666 --> 02:49.637
YEAH. WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT DOING IN THERE?

02:49.637 --> 02:53.106
BENNY, I SWEAR, I'VE NEVER
SEEN THIS BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.708
YOU'RE CHEATING ON ME,
AREN'T YOU?

02:54.708 --> 02:57.211
(imitates Rodney Dangerfield)
HEY, THOSE THINGS ARE SO BIG,

02:57.211 --> 03:01.181
I'LL BE THERE'LL STILL BE SNOW
ON THEM IN THE SUMMER. HEY.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.719
(normal voice) HE'S A GUY ON TV.
NOBODY RESPECTS HIM.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.391
MY MOM WAS DEPRESSED FOR A MONTH
AFTER WAYNE CHEATED ON HER.

03:10.391 --> 03:13.394
THAT'S WHY I DON'T EVEN
TELL HER WHEN HE CALLS.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.564
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
MAYBE HE'S CHANGED.

03:16.564 --> 03:17.931
ANGIE, GUYS DON'T CHANGE.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.368
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO CHANGE ME FOR YEARS,

03:20.368 --> 03:22.603
BUT I STILL SCOOP
THE PEANUT BUTTER OUT

03:22.603 --> 03:26.173
WITH MY FINGERS.
NO, YOU DON'T. I CHECK.

03:26.173 --> 03:29.543
OH, I DO. I JUST SMOOTH IT
WITH A SPOON SO YOU CAN'T TELL.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.045
IF YOU ALREADY
HAVE THE SPOON OUT,

03:32.045 --> 03:33.847
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST USE THAT?

03:33.847 --> 03:36.517
BECAUSE IT TASTES BETTER
OFF MY FINGER.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.752
IT'S SCARY, REALLY,
HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.488
(doorbell rings)

03:40.488 --> 03:42.890
THAT'S PROBABLY WAYNE.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.160
YOU BETTER NOT TELL WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED WITH WAYNE.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.829
I WON'T.

03:48.829 --> 03:52.199
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'D BE SAFER
IF YOU JUST GOT OUT OF HERE.

03:52.199 --> 03:55.503
NAH, YOU CAN TRUST ME.
I CAN KEEP A SECRET.
NO, YOU CAN'T.

03:55.503 --> 03:58.639
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO KEEP
A SECRET YOUR WHOLE LIFE. OUT.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.041
OH, YEAH?
I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT

04:01.041 --> 04:03.611
THAT GUY AT WORK,
"DRILL PRESS" STEVE, IS GAY.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.879
THAT'S NOT A SECRET.
HE STOCKS THE VENDING MACHINES,

04:05.879 --> 04:08.081
YET THEY CALL HIM
"DRILL PRESS STEVE."

04:08.081 --> 04:09.917
THINK. THINK.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.220
AHEM. GEORGE.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.689
HEY, GEORGE.
YOU LOOK GOOD.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.625
I SEE
YOU'RE STILL LYING.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.193
ALL I SAID WAS,
"YOU LOOK GOOD."

04:20.193 --> 04:23.364
AND THAT'S A LIE, BECAUSE
Â¿SABESQUÃ©? I LOOK GREAT.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.698
I LOSS WEIGHT,

04:24.698 --> 04:27.167
AND I HAD MY TEETH WHITENED.
WHAT-TCHA. (squeaks)

04:27.167 --> 04:30.871
COME ON. IT WAS 30 YEARS AGO.
WON'T BENNY AT LEAST TALK TO ME?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.873
LOOK, LIKE I TOLD YOU
LAST TIME,

04:32.873 --> 04:35.843
MY MOM'S NOT GONNA SEE YOU,
MAN, SO GIVE IT UP.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.546
YOU KNOW, IF I'M GONNA GET
TURNED DOWN AGAIN,

04:38.546 --> 04:41.582
I NEED TO HEAR IT FROM HER.
WHAT'S HER PHONE NUMBER?

04:41.582 --> 04:43.584
IT'S 3--
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

04:43.584 --> 04:47.721
FINE. I'LL GO LOOK HER UP
IN THE PHONE BOOK.

04:47.721 --> 04:51.024
I MEAN, HOW MANY LOPEZES
CAN THERE BE IN L.A.?

04:51.024 --> 04:53.494
PLEASE TELL ME HER NUMBER.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.862
GEORGE, IT SEEMS LIKE

04:54.862 --> 04:57.831
WAYNE IS PRETTY DETERMINED
TO TALK TO YOUR MOM.

04:57.831 --> 05:01.435
MAYBE IT'S TIME HE KNEW
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.937
YEAH. (clears throat)

05:03.937 --> 05:06.674
YOU'RE RIGHT. UM...

05:06.674 --> 05:09.209
I-I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT YOU, WAYNE,

05:09.209 --> 05:12.680
BUT, UH, MY MOM'S DEAD.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.383
OH, NO.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

05:16.684 --> 05:19.687
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TELL WAYNE
HOW YOUR MOM DIED.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.089
YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THAT?

05:22.089 --> 05:25.793
SHE SMOKED AND DRANK
FOR SO LONG, WAYNE,

05:25.793 --> 05:30.464
THAT SHE HAD
A MYO-CARDENAS INFECTION.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.800
DON'T YOU MEAN
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.502
I WISH. THAT'S TREATABLE.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.837
THE THING I SAID--
VERY DEADLY.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.775
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

05:45.446 --> 05:47.314
* ALL MY FRIENDS

05:47.314 --> 05:50.884
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

05:52.486 --> 05:55.055
* THE LOW RIDER

05:55.055 --> 05:57.591
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

05:59.192 --> 06:02.863
**

06:07.300 --> 06:09.302
SO, YEAH,
I MEAN, THERE IT IS.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.539
MY MOM PASSED AWAY.

06:11.539 --> 06:14.307
I'M SO SORRY.
I MEAN, AFTER MY DIVORCE,

06:14.307 --> 06:17.010
I REALLY HAD IT
WORKED UP IN MY HEAD

06:17.010 --> 06:18.846
THAT SOMEHOW I HAD A...

06:18.846 --> 06:21.114
I HAD A CHANCE
OF WINNING HER BACK.

06:21.114 --> 06:24.785
SHE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN
WHO EVER CALLED ME ON MY CRAP.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.820
SHE MADE ME A BETTER MAN.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.023
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S GONE.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.628
THAT IS SO SWEET.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.865
BENNY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
REALLY HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.332
GEORGE?

06:39.332 --> 06:42.269
ANGIE, SHE'S DEAD.
SHE'D BE HAPPY TO SEE ANYTHING.

06:42.269 --> 06:46.507
REALLY, A CLOUD, A TOMATO.
MENTION SOMETHING.
UH, A CAT?

06:46.507 --> 06:48.709
NO, BRO, SHE HATED CATS.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.744
YOU REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HER
THAT WELL, DID YOU?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.312
WELL, I GUESS NOT.

06:52.312 --> 06:55.348
WELL, IF YOU DON'T MIND, UM,
I NEED TIME TO GRIEVE...

06:55.348 --> 06:56.850
OH, I'M SORRY.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.351
INTERNALLY.
OF COURSE.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.254
DAD, GRANDMA BENNY'S
ON THE PHONE.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.990
ON THE PHONE?

07:02.990 --> 07:05.192
STUPID KID. HE KEEPS
SPILLING HER ASHES.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.494
SPONGE OFF THE PHONE

07:06.494 --> 07:09.029
AND PUT THE URN
BACK ON THE MANTEL.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.230
TAKE CARE, WAYNE.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.866
SURROUND YOURSELF
WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.869
GRANDMA'S MAD THAT YOU
KICKED HER OUT OF THE CAR.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.338
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
ASHES?

07:18.338 --> 07:20.741
I WAS LYING TO THAT MAN
TO PROTECT GRANDMA.

07:20.741 --> 07:24.878
WHAT IS HE, A BOOKIE?
BILL COLLECTOR? REPO MAN--

07:24.878 --> 07:26.914
MARRIED GUY
WITH AN ANGRY WIFE?

07:26.914 --> 07:30.050
ALL RIGHT. NO MORE SLEEPOVERS
AT GRANDMA'S FOR YOU.

07:34.221 --> 07:37.525
DID YOU SEE HOW CHOKED UP
WAYNE WAS ABOUT YOUR MOM?

07:37.525 --> 07:39.827
I THINK YOU SHOULD
TELL BENNY ABOUT HIM

07:39.827 --> 07:42.329
AND LET HER DECIDE
WHAT TO DO.
NO, I IF TELL HER
ABOUT WAYNE NOW,

07:42.329 --> 07:45.032
SHE'S GONNA FIND OUT THAT
I'VE BEEN LYING ABOUT HIM

07:45.032 --> 07:47.701
ALL THESE YEARS.
SHE'S GONNA FIND OUT EVENTUALLY.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.837
NO, SHE'S NOT.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
AWAY WITH THIS.

07:49.837 --> 07:54.307
THE TRUTH ALWAYS COMES OUT.
NO, THE LOPEZ WAY IS YOU TAKE
YOUR SECRETS TO THE GRAVE.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.177
THEN THEY COME OUT
AT THE FUNERAL AND A BIG FIGHT.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.379
REMEMBER WHEN
MY COUSIN ROBERTO DIED,

07:59.379 --> 08:02.950
AND THE TWO WOMEN HE WAS MARRIED
TO FOUND OUT ABOUT EACH OTHER?
THAT WAS SAD.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.218
SAD? IT WAS FUNNY.
TWO WOMEN IN DRESSES

08:05.218 --> 08:07.420
WITH PAINTED-ON EYEBROWS
THROWING PUNCHES?

08:07.420 --> 08:09.222
IT WAS LIKE
MEXICAN "DYNASTY."

08:09.222 --> 08:11.925
IF YOU DON'T TELL
YOUR MOM THE TRUTH,

08:11.925 --> 08:14.528
I AM GONNA LOSE
SOME RESPECT FOR YOU.

08:14.528 --> 08:17.731
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
WOULD YOU LOSE SO MUCH RESPECT

08:17.731 --> 08:20.400
THAT YOU WOULD LEAVE ME?
WELL, OF COURSE NOT.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.903
OKAY, THEN I'M GOOD.

08:24.404 --> 08:27.440
(can opens)
(Benny)
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?

08:27.440 --> 08:30.143
UH, "SportsCenter."
(clears throat)

08:30.143 --> 08:32.245
I'D STICK AROUND, BENNY,

08:32.245 --> 08:35.482
BECAUSE THERE'S
AN INTERESTING MOVIE COMING ON.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.085
IT'S BASED ON A TRUE STORY.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.920
IT'S ABOUT A MOM

08:39.920 --> 08:42.222
WHO LIED TO HER SON
HIS WHOLE LIFE,

08:42.222 --> 08:46.059
AND THEN ONE TIME,
THE SON LIES TO THE MOTHER.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.261
OH, YEAH.
I THINK I SAW IT.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.730
IT'S THE ONE WHERE

08:49.730 --> 08:52.633
FARRAH FAWCETT
LIGHTS THAT GUY ON FIRE.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.535
NO, THIS MOVIE
IS REALLY HEARTWARMING

08:55.535 --> 08:58.105
BECAUSE THE SON
FINALLY REALIZES

08:58.105 --> 09:00.908
HOW MUCH IT HURT
WHEN HE WAS LIED TO,

09:00.908 --> 09:03.577
SO HE DECIDES
TO COME CLEAN.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.179
AND THEN
SHE SET HIM ON FIRE?

09:06.179 --> 09:09.182
QUE LA, WHAT ABOUT THE ONE
WHERE THE WIFE IS RIGHT,

09:09.182 --> 09:11.885
BUT SHE'S SO ANNOYING,
THAT WHEN SHE GOES MISSING,

09:11.885 --> 09:13.887
THEY DON'T LOOK FOR HER?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.890
IT'S SAD, BUT I FOUND MYSELF
ROOTING FOR THE HUSBAND.

09:18.759 --> 09:22.162
ALL I HEARD WAS,
"THE WIFE IS RIGHT."

09:31.639 --> 09:34.241
HEY, HEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.643
OKAY.

09:37.911 --> 09:41.348
WE GOTTA TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING. OKAY?

09:41.348 --> 09:44.818
REMEMBER A LONG TIME AGO
YOU HAD THIS BOYFRIEND,

09:44.818 --> 09:46.253
THIS GUY NAMED WAYNE?

09:46.253 --> 09:49.657
OF COURSE I REMEMBER WAYNE.
(chuckles)

09:49.657 --> 09:53.694
HE WAS THE BEST GUY
I EVER WENT OUT WITH,

09:53.694 --> 09:56.764
UNTIL, YOU KNOW,
HE CHEATED ON ME.

09:56.764 --> 10:00.200
WAIT, YOU LIKED HIM
THAT MUCH, HUH?

10:00.200 --> 10:03.871
OH, I WAITED FOREVER
FOR HIM TO MAKE IT UP TO ME,

10:03.871 --> 10:06.707
BUT HE NEVER DID.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.709
IT'S ONE OF
MY BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENTS.

10:08.709 --> 10:12.746
PROBABLY, HE WOULD'VE
CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.948
WHY DO YOU BRING HIM UP?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.687
UM...

10:19.687 --> 10:22.690
HE'S DEAD.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.992
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

10:24.992 --> 10:29.697
WELL, HE'S PROBABLY NOT
GONNA BE LOOKING ME UP NOW.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.631
(laughs)
HE'S PROBABLY NOT.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.001
HEY, I JUST SIGNED
FOR THESE FLOWERS.

10:34.001 --> 10:37.504
UH, THEY'RE FROM SOMEONE
NAMED, UH, WAYNE--

10:37.504 --> 10:39.206
GET RID OF THEM.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.774
WHAT? WHAT?

10:40.774 --> 10:43.110
WHAT IS GOING ON?

10:46.379 --> 10:48.315
WHO ARE THE FLOWERS FOR?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.083
UM...

10:50.083 --> 10:51.351
ANGIE.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.722
OH, YEAH? WHY DOES IT SAY,
"REST IN PEACE"?

10:54.722 --> 10:56.656
HA! I WAS GOOD LAST NIGHT.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.892
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
SHE NEEDS HER REST.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.261
THEN WHY DOES IT SAY,
"IN LOVING MEMORY"?

11:01.261 --> 11:04.998
IN MEMORY OF THE LOVING.
ANY MORE QUESTIONS?

11:04.998 --> 11:07.534
YEAH, HOW MANY TIMES
ARE YOU GOING TO MENTION

11:07.534 --> 11:10.203
SLEEPING WITH MY DAUGHTER
BEFORE I LEAVE THE ROOM?

11:10.203 --> 11:14.007
LOOK, I'M SORRY. ALL RIGHT,
WE BOTH KNOW SHE'S AN ANGEL...

11:14.007 --> 11:17.745
TILL SHE WALKS UP
THOSE STAIRS. HELLO.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.915
COME ON, GEORGE.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.151
WHAT ARE THE FLOWERS
REALLY FOR?

11:24.151 --> 11:26.386
YOU GOT SOMETHING FOR WAYNE,
DIDN'T YOU?

11:26.386 --> 11:29.256
ALL RIGHT. YEAH,
THEY'RE FOR WAYNE'S FUNERAL.

11:29.256 --> 11:32.359
I'M GONNA TAKE 'EM
OVER THERE, YOU KNOW,

11:32.359 --> 11:35.062
'CAUSE I ALWAYS
KIND OF LIKED THE GUY.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.597
OH, MY GOD.
WAYNE IS DEAD?

11:37.597 --> 11:39.967
HE WAS JUST HERE
YESTERDAY.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.103
GOD, IT'S SO WEIRD,

11:43.103 --> 11:45.705
THE WAY YOU TOLD HIM
THAT BENNY'S DEAD,

11:45.705 --> 11:48.408
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY,
HE DIES?

11:48.408 --> 11:50.277
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

11:50.277 --> 11:52.012
WAYNE WAS HERE?

11:52.012 --> 11:54.147
WHAT IS GOING ON, GEORGE?

11:54.147 --> 11:57.384
ALL RIGHT,
HERE IT IS, OKAY?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.920
WAYNE CAME TO SEE YOU.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.990
OKAY, MOM? HE KNEW...
THAT HE WAS DYING,

12:02.990 --> 12:07.727
AND HE WROTE DOWN
SOME LAST WORDS FOR YOU.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.363
"S-SORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.965
"FORGET ABOUT ME.

12:11.965 --> 12:15.202
NEVER BLAME GEORGE."

12:15.202 --> 12:17.170
LET ME SEE THAT.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.972
IT CONTINUES.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.708
"I AM WRITING
IN DISAPPEARING INK

12:21.708 --> 12:24.411
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
ANYONE TO..."

12:30.450 --> 12:33.020
IT'S GONE.

12:33.020 --> 12:37.190
NOW WE'LL NEVER KNOW!

12:47.134 --> 12:50.303
NOW YOU BETTER TELL ME
THE TRUTH ABOUT WAYNE.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.272
ALL RIGHT.
WAYNE WAS HERE YESTERDAY

12:52.272 --> 12:55.042
BECAUSE HE WANTED
TO SEE YOU, MOM.

12:55.042 --> 12:58.511
I TOLD HIM YOU WERE DEAD,
AND THESE FLOWERS ARE FOR YOU.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.313
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

13:00.313 --> 13:02.315
BECAUSE HE CHEATED
ON YOU ONCE,

13:02.315 --> 13:05.018
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE YOU GET HURT AGAIN,

13:05.018 --> 13:06.586
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY MOM.

13:06.586 --> 13:09.689
REALLY? WOW. THAT'S NICE,

13:09.689 --> 13:11.892
BUT IT'S A LIE.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.094
NOW TELL ME THE TRUTH...

13:14.094 --> 13:17.364
OR I'LL RIP OFF
ONE OF DUMBO'S EARS,

13:17.364 --> 13:20.567
AND HE'LL ONLY BE ABLE TO FLY
IN CIRCLES!

13:20.567 --> 13:22.435
OW. OW.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.004
TELL HER. TELL HER.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.339
THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.808
(groans)
IT WAS ALL GEORGE'S IDEA!

13:28.808 --> 13:30.810
HE SET UP
THE WHOLE THING!

13:30.810 --> 13:32.379
OW!

13:32.379 --> 13:34.247
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

13:34.247 --> 13:35.849
OW!

13:35.849 --> 13:37.150
ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED,

13:37.150 --> 13:39.386
BUT JUST REMEMBER,
THIS IS THE '70s.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.589
"DISCO DUCK" WAS A HIT.
WHITE PEOPLE HAD AFROS, MOM.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.092
NOTHING MADE SENSE.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.360
(making whooshing sounds)

13:47.360 --> 13:49.529
HEY, GEORGE,
GEORGE, GEORGE,

13:49.529 --> 13:53.133
I GOT MY MOM'S BRA.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.135
BUT IF YOU HAVE THAT,

13:55.135 --> 13:58.138
WHERE'S SKIPPER
AND GILLIGAN SLEEPING?

13:58.138 --> 13:59.806
(Wayne and Benny
speaking indistinctly)

13:59.806 --> 14:01.141
THEY'RE COMING.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.479
(laughs)

14:06.479 --> 14:08.415
(laughs) STOP. OH.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.351
GEORGE,
TAKE YOUR GIRLFRIEND

14:11.351 --> 14:13.954
AND GO PLAY DOLLS
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.625
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.493
YOU FRAMED HIM.

14:20.493 --> 14:24.031
DO YOU REALIZE
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID,

14:24.031 --> 14:27.267
I HATED MEN FOR 20 YEARS?

14:27.267 --> 14:28.768
HATED MEN?

14:28.768 --> 14:30.770
NOT ON FRIDAY
AND SATURDAY NIGHTS.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.572
HOW DUMB
DO YOU THINK I WAS?

14:32.572 --> 14:35.642
I KNEW THERE WASN'T
A GHOST IN YOUR ROOM.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.411
(imitating ghost moaning)

14:38.411 --> 14:39.779
AAH! OH!

14:39.779 --> 14:43.683
NO GHOST CALLS OUT
MEN'S NAMES.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.818
OH, NOW I GET IT!

14:45.818 --> 14:49.022
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY A GHOST
WOULD HAUNT FOR TEN MINUTES,

14:49.022 --> 14:52.625
GO USE YOUR BATHROOM,
THEN HAUNT AGAIN.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.431
WAYNE WAS THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.934
I THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA GET MARRIED.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.570
WHY WOULD YOU
DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

15:05.472 --> 15:07.941
WAYNE MAY HAVE BEEN
GREAT FOR YOU,

15:07.941 --> 15:09.742
BUT NOT FOR ME.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.611
WAS HE MEAN TO YOU?

15:11.611 --> 15:14.647
DID HE SMACK YOU AROUND
WHEN I WASN'T IN THE ROOM?

15:14.647 --> 15:18.318
BECAUSE THAT'S OKAY.
I GAVE HIM PERMISSION.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.022
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.159
MOM, MOM, GUESS WHAT?

15:26.159 --> 15:28.996
THE COACH PICKED ME
TO BE ON THE ALL-STAR TEAM.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.866
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

15:33.866 --> 15:38.171
THAT MEANS YOU'RE BETTER
THAN ALL THE OTHER WATER BOYS.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.673
NO!
THE GAME IS SATURDAY NIGHT,

15:40.673 --> 15:44.377
AND YOU PROMISED YOU'D GO
IF I MADE THE TEAM.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.580
OKAY, QUIT YOUR WHINING.
I WILL BE THERE.

15:47.580 --> 15:48.815
(door opens)

15:48.815 --> 15:51.584
BABE? BABE?

15:51.584 --> 15:53.386
I GOT A BIG SURPRISE.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.855
GEORGE, GO TO YOUR ROOM.
TURN ON THE STEREO.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.357
NO, NO, NOT THAT.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.459
I MET
WITH THIS INVESTOR GUY.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.661
HE MAY WANT TO FRANCHISE
THE BUSINESS.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.664
I'M GONNA GO TO THE FONDUE PLACE
WITH HIM SATURDAY NIGHT,

16:04.664 --> 16:08.068
TRY TO SEAL THE DEAL.
BABE, I REALLY NEED YOU THERE.

16:08.068 --> 16:11.271
YOU CAN'T GO, MOM. YOU PROMISED
YOU'D BE AT MY ALL-STAR GAME.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.207
I KNOW,
BUT WAYNE NEEDS ME.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.277
UH, IF YOU REALLY
ARE AN ALL-STAR,

16:17.277 --> 16:19.312
YOU'LL MAKE THE TEAM
NEXT YEAR,

16:19.312 --> 16:23.650
AND I'LL--I'LL--I'LL GO
TO THAT GAME.

16:30.423 --> 16:33.793
YOU COULDN'T SHARE ME,
SO YOU RUINED MY LIFE?

16:33.793 --> 16:37.064
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
WAYNE MEANT TO YOU, MOM.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.865
I WAS 10.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

16:38.865 --> 16:41.901
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COOL
IF YOU MARRIED ELTON JOHN.

16:41.901 --> 16:43.470
OH.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.806
GEORGE, WAYNE COULD'VE MADE
OUR LIVES SO MUCH BETTER,

16:46.806 --> 16:48.508
BUT YOU BLEW IT.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.378
MOM, I FEEL HORRIBLE ABOUT THIS,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.381
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
IT WASN'T A LONG TIME AGO.

16:54.381 --> 16:58.618
HE CAME BY THE OTHER DAY,
AND YOU TOLD HIM I WAS DEAD.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.019
YOU LIED.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.021
YOU'RE ALWAYS
CALLING ME A LIAR,

17:02.021 --> 17:04.057
BUT YOU ARE NO BETTER.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.593
YES, I AM.
I ONLY LIED ONCE.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.795
REALLY?
IS THIS THE FIRST TIME

17:08.795 --> 17:10.730
WAYNE TRIED
TO CONTACT ME?

17:10.730 --> 17:13.333
YES.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.138
HE COMES BY
EVERY TIME HE'S SINGLE.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.473
IT'S BEEN 7 TIMES
IN THE LAST 30 YEARS.

17:20.473 --> 17:24.611
OH,
HE MISSES YOU GREATLY.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.279
SEVEN TIMES?

17:26.279 --> 17:28.281
OKAY, SO I WAS RAISED

17:28.281 --> 17:31.318
BY THE BIGGEST LIAR
IN THE WORLD.

17:31.318 --> 17:34.354
YOU TOLD ME FOR MY BIRTHDAY
THAT YOU GOT ME A CAT,

17:34.354 --> 17:36.623
LIKE A SPECIAL BREED
CALLED THE "NUT-CAT."

17:36.623 --> 17:40.127
THAT SQUIRREL ALMOST
TORE UP MY WHOLE FACE.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.728
AT LEAST
I DIDN'T RUIN YOUR LIFE.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.930
I'M GONNA DIE ALONE,
THANKS TO YOU.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.065
NO, YOU'RE NOT, MOM,

17:46.065 --> 17:48.168
BECAUSE I'M GONNA FIND WAYNE,
AND I'M GONNA FIX THIS.

17:48.168 --> 17:51.504
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU GUYS
A SECOND CHANCE.
YOU TOLD HIM I WAS DEAD.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.274
SO I'LL TELL HIM THE TRUTH,
AND I PROMISE YOU, MOM,

17:54.274 --> 17:55.775
WHEN HE SEES YOU,
HE'S GONNA THINK

17:55.775 --> 17:58.778
YOU'RE AS BEAUTIFUL NOW
AS YOU WERE 30 YEARS AGO.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.182
OH, QUE LA, I'M LYING,
AND NOW I CAN'T STOP LYING.

18:10.190 --> 18:13.092
I TOLD YOU I'D FIX IT.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.394
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:14.394 --> 18:16.095
I BROUGHT WAYNE HERE,

18:16.095 --> 18:19.699
AND HE WANTS TO CATCH UP,
REGENERATE LOVE.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.801
HELLO, BENITA.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.803
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.538
WAYNE.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.074
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.009
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

18:30.009 --> 18:33.045
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
I WAS GONNA SEE HIM TONIGHT?

18:33.045 --> 18:36.749
JEEZ, I WOULD'VE WORN
MORE MAKEUP AND LESS UNDERWEAR.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.985
HEY, SHE'S WEARING
UNDERWEAR AGAIN.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.187
AY.

18:44.157 --> 18:49.329
OKAY,
THIS MIGHT WORK OUT.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.831
YEAH, I HOPE SO.
YOU KNOW, IT FEELS GOOD

18:51.831 --> 18:53.933
NOT HAVING THIS HANGING
OVER MY HEAD ANYMORE.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.336
WELL, IF YOU DON'T LIE
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

18:56.336 --> 18:58.505
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT HURTING PEOPLE.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.573
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.776
SOME LIES ARE ACTUALLY GOOD FOR
PEOPLE, LIKE YOU, FOR EXAMPLE.
DON'T TELL ME.

19:03.776 --> 19:07.447
NO, YOUR WEDDING RING.
YOU SHOULD KNOW.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

19:07.447 --> 19:11.184
IF SOMEONE TRIES TO STEAL IT,
DON'T FIGHT FOR IT.

19:11.184 --> 19:14.554
SHOULD I FIGHT
FOR MY DIAMOND EARRINGS?

19:14.554 --> 19:17.324
ONLY IF THAT GUY'S SMALL.
DAMN IT.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.262
OHH!

19:22.262 --> 19:24.997
HEY,
WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?

19:24.997 --> 19:28.668
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.
WE'RE GOING TO A MOTEL.
WHAT?!

19:28.668 --> 19:31.871
LOOK, I'M TRYING TO TAKE
THINGS SLOW THIS TIME.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.673
I'M GONNA SLEEP WITH HIM,

19:33.673 --> 19:35.675
BUT IF THINGS
DON'T WORK OUT,

19:35.675 --> 19:39.045
I DO NOT WANT HIM
TO KNOW WHERE I LIVE.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.781
I GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT THIS!

19:41.781 --> 19:45.385
I FEEL BAD FOR THE PEOPLE
IN THE NEXT ROOM.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.387
THEY DON'T KNOW
THE MOTEL IS HAUNTED.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.022
(imitating ghost moaning)

19:50.022 --> 19:52.425
OH, WAYNE.
