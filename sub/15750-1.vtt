00:38.099 --> 00:40.819
Not long now, Miss Hawkins,
you will be needed upstairs.

00:40.859 --> 00:42.979
This goes here, that there.

00:43.019 --> 00:45.299
No, no, no. Over there, please.

00:45.339 --> 00:47.219
Just on my way.
Jolly good.

00:52.259 --> 00:55.099
Mr. Selfridge. This is a proud day.

00:55.139 --> 00:58.819
It's five years to the day since
the store first opened its doors.

00:59.739 --> 01:02.899
How does it feel to run
the biggest attraction in town?

01:02.939 --> 01:06.099
We are not the biggest attraction
in town. We are the third biggest.

01:07.139 --> 01:10.099
Behind Buckingham Palace
and the Tower of London.

01:12.779 --> 01:15.539
Over. Chin up! Up!

01:16.779 --> 01:18.899
A store is nothing
without its staff,

01:18.939 --> 01:21.619
like a home is nothing
without its family.

01:23.059 --> 01:26.659
But, your family aren't here
to celebrate with you.

01:26.699 --> 01:29.219
How do you feel about that,
Mr. Selfridge?

01:32.259 --> 01:35.899
My daughters are finishing their
education back in the States,

01:35.939 --> 01:37.899
and my wife and mother
need to be with them.

01:37.939 --> 01:41.059
I don't have more time, I'm sorry.
I have a very busy day.

01:41.099 --> 01:43.459
I am sure you understand.
Of course.

01:57.499 --> 01:59.139
Mr. Selfridge!

02:07.019 --> 02:09.619
On this special occasion,
how do you feel?

02:09.658 --> 02:11.419
Mr. Selfridge, any comment?

02:12.259 --> 02:14.059
He's here!
He's early.

02:14.099 --> 02:15.939
Look to it, everyone!

02:17.219 --> 02:20.459
Good morning, Mr. Selfridge.
Good morning, Mr. Grove.

02:20.499 --> 02:22.939
Have you seen the banner,
Mr. Selfridge?

02:22.979 --> 02:24.579
It looks great.

02:24.619 --> 02:28.099
I wanted your approval on the house
perfume display, Mr. Selfridge.

02:28.139 --> 02:30.419
Beautifully arranged, Miss Hawkins.

02:30.459 --> 02:32.459
And erm...

02:33.659 --> 02:35.299
Good morning, Miss Mardle.

02:35.339 --> 02:38.219
Congratulations on five
wonderful years, Mr. Selfridge.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.859
We're so proud to be a part of it.

02:39.899 --> 02:42.259
I'm proud of you, Miss Mardle.
Thank you.

02:42.299 --> 02:43.899
Telegram for you.
Thank you.

02:50.579 --> 02:53.859
Franco, come on. Help Mr. Towler.
Yes, Victor.

02:53.899 --> 02:56.459
How many times, Franco?
Not Victor. Not in here.

02:56.499 --> 02:58.219
Thanks, boys.

03:00.779 --> 03:03.059
Good morning, Mr. Selfridge.
Good morning.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.859
Palm Court. Fourth floor.

03:04.899 --> 03:09.259
Now, your 12.45
looks particularly interesting.

03:09.299 --> 03:12.539
The publicity surrounding
the anniversary has been splendid.

03:12.579 --> 03:15.699
Not bad considering five years ago
they all said we'd flop.

03:15.739 --> 03:18.419
Miss Plunkett?
Yes, Mr. Selfridge?

03:18.459 --> 03:20.179
Why are we going to the Palm Court?

03:21.699 --> 03:24.619
That's it. That's it. Come on!

03:24.659 --> 03:26.979
Come on. Come on, ladies!

03:27.939 --> 03:31.139
No! No! Go back. Go back. Go! Go!

03:34.219 --> 03:35.539
Mr. Selfridge.

03:35.579 --> 03:39.179
Mr. Crabb. Miss Plunkett tells me
you need to speak to me?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.579
It's not me that needs
to speak to you, Mr. Selfridge.

03:41.619 --> 03:44.899
It's Mr. Thackeray.
Indeed.

03:44.939 --> 03:49.419
Good morning, Mr. Selfridge and
what a marvellous morning it is...

03:51.139 --> 03:53.139
Well, what is it?

03:54.739 --> 03:56.379
The mannequins.

03:58.139 --> 03:59.979
Shoddy work, you see.

04:00.019 --> 04:03.099
I want to buy in a whole new batch.

04:04.219 --> 04:06.579
When I worked with Paul Poiret,

04:06.619 --> 04:09.739
we had an exquisite
mannequin maker, Russian,

04:09.779 --> 04:12.179
rumored to be the former
mistress of the Tsar.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.659
If you need them, buy them.
I must move on.

04:14.699 --> 04:16.379
Mr. Colleano needs two minutes...

04:16.418 --> 04:19.298
Doesn't anyone understand?
I have a busy day ahead of me!

05:00.539 --> 05:03.659
Mr. Selfridge,
on behalf of all the staff,

05:03.699 --> 05:07.259
I congratulate you on this
fifth anniversary of our store.

05:07.299 --> 05:11.379
I think we'd all agree we couldn't
have wished for a finer leader.

05:12.619 --> 05:15.139
It has been an inspiration
to serve under you.

05:15.179 --> 05:18.579
And in token of our gratitude,
and our affection,

05:18.619 --> 05:20.859
we'd like you to accept this.

05:33.299 --> 05:36.979
For once, I find myself without
words to thank you for this honor.

05:37.019 --> 05:38.939
But, I thank you all.

05:38.979 --> 05:40.859
These last five years

05:40.899 --> 05:44.779
you have shared my vision
and we've worked together

05:44.819 --> 05:48.659
to make Selfridges into
a truly great house of business.

05:53.499 --> 05:55.779
Who knows what
the next five years hold?

05:57.219 --> 05:59.299
These are uncertain times.

06:00.299 --> 06:04.099
So, it's more important than ever
to pull together,

06:04.139 --> 06:09.179
and look to the loyalty
and love of those around us.

06:10.179 --> 06:13.139
I thank you, for this.

06:13.179 --> 06:17.139
I thank you and, and for everything!

06:33.219 --> 06:36.379
My goodness! Miss Towler!

06:36.419 --> 06:38.379
Hello, Mr. Grove.

06:40.099 --> 06:43.379
How well you look.
Paris must have agreed with you.

06:43.419 --> 06:44.979
How are you?

06:46.099 --> 06:47.899
Very well, thank you.

06:47.939 --> 06:51.819
And Miss Mardle?
Isn't she...? Isn't she here?

06:53.939 --> 06:57.299
No. No, she doesn't appear to be.

06:58.579 --> 07:00.739
Please excuse me.

07:03.859 --> 07:06.539
Is she the one you let go?

07:06.579 --> 07:09.779
No. She's the one who left.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.459
How about you, are you well?

07:13.499 --> 07:15.379
I'm Head of Cosmetics now.

07:15.419 --> 07:18.539
Mr. Selfridge has created
a whole new department for me.

07:18.579 --> 07:21.019
Gosh... Congratulations.

07:21.059 --> 07:23.739
Well, let's hope
he hasn't forgotten you.

07:23.779 --> 07:25.859
Two years is a long time.

07:25.899 --> 07:30.779
I'm to be the Head of Displays
across all the departments.

07:30.819 --> 07:32.699
Oh!

07:32.739 --> 07:34.779
If you will excuse me.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.579
Aggie?

07:42.619 --> 07:45.939
Is it really you?
It's really me!

07:55.339 --> 07:57.259
Ah, Pimble.

07:57.299 --> 08:00.219
Have Hooper bring the car round.
I'm going out.

08:00.259 --> 08:02.779
If you please, my lady...
Yes?

08:02.819 --> 08:05.259
Lord Loxley's downstairs.

08:07.179 --> 08:08.259
What?

08:08.299 --> 08:11.419
He's brought luggage, my lady.

08:27.739 --> 08:32.458
Loxley... You should have said
you were coming.

08:32.499 --> 08:34.739
I'd have had your bedroom aired
if I'd known.

08:34.779 --> 08:37.659
I have business in London.
Times are changing.

08:37.698 --> 08:40.419
New opportunities are opening up.

08:40.458 --> 08:44.179
Where are you going?
Selfridges.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.339
I've just had a bill
from that place,

08:46.379 --> 08:48.219
along with every other
shop in London.

08:48.259 --> 08:51.979
One has to keep up appearances.
Damn appearances!

08:52.019 --> 08:55.139
I'm coming with you.
I want to meet this Selfridge chap.

08:55.179 --> 08:57.459
Pimble, have someone
take up my bags.

08:57.499 --> 08:59.779
I need to get out of these
traveling clothes.

09:03.139 --> 09:05.659
It was sculpted by Sir Thomas Brock.

09:05.699 --> 09:08.259
Every member of staff contributed.

09:08.299 --> 09:12.619
It's a wonderful surprise.
Not the only surprise of the day.

09:12.659 --> 09:14.619
Hello.
Rose!

09:14.659 --> 09:16.979
I had no idea!

09:17.979 --> 09:20.219
Do you think
I'd miss a day like this?

09:20.259 --> 09:23.139
Miss Plunkett,
clear my diary for this morning.

09:23.179 --> 09:25.179
I want to catch up with my wife.

09:26.419 --> 09:27.939
When did you arrive?

09:55.939 --> 09:57.499
Henri.

10:14.259 --> 10:16.299
The girls send love
and so does Mother.

10:16.339 --> 10:18.499
They'll be here mid August as usual.

10:18.539 --> 10:21.339
It means the world to me
that you came back early.

10:22.699 --> 10:24.619
It's so good to see you, Rose.

10:24.659 --> 10:26.659
Yeah. It's good to
see you too, Harry.

10:26.699 --> 10:28.779
Can't you stay a little longer?

10:28.819 --> 10:31.099
Ma could take the girls
back to the States.

10:31.139 --> 10:34.139
Congratulations on the store's
anniversary, Mr. Selfridge.

10:34.179 --> 10:35.219
Thank you so much.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.619
Mrs. Selfridge.
Thank you.

10:36.659 --> 10:38.379
Thank you.
Enjoy your day.

10:39.499 --> 10:41.539
All this going backwards
and forwards...

10:41.579 --> 10:44.859
Do we have to talk about this
the moment I get here?

10:44.899 --> 10:47.499
I just never get
to see you honey, please?

10:47.539 --> 10:50.739
Harry, I am very happy to come
and be Mrs. Selfridge for you,

10:50.779 --> 10:53.659
to perform all public duties
required, but you...

10:53.699 --> 10:57.619
Might I say bravo, Mr. Selfridge,
on five wonderful years.

10:57.659 --> 10:58.979
Thank you so much.

11:00.099 --> 11:04.699
You know what we agreed on
and it will remain so.

11:05.739 --> 11:07.659
It's for the best.
It's not for the best...

11:07.699 --> 11:09.859
Congratulations,
Mr. and Mrs. Selfridge.

11:09.899 --> 11:13.339
Delphine! It's so lovely to see you.

11:13.379 --> 11:16.459
I hope you don't mind me
interrupting you. No, not at all.

11:16.499 --> 11:19.739
I was walking down Oxford Street
and I was curious to see the store.

11:19.779 --> 11:22.539
Harry, this is a woman
you simply HAVE to meet.

11:22.579 --> 11:25.539
My dear friend Delphine Day.
We met on the boat coming over.

11:25.579 --> 11:27.059
Now we're inseparable!

11:27.099 --> 11:29.779
I've heard so much about you,
I feel as if I already know you!

11:29.819 --> 11:32.699
And I've heard of you.

11:32.739 --> 11:35.339
Don't you run that club, Delphine's?

11:35.379 --> 11:39.139
You make it sound very wicked.
It does have a certain reputation.

11:39.179 --> 11:42.379
I should jolly well hope so.
It gets people through my doors.

11:42.419 --> 11:45.219
Harry, Delphine has written
the most marvellous book.

11:45.259 --> 11:47.499
My publishers just confirmed it.

11:47.539 --> 11:50.579
It's being released
at the end of the week. Really?

11:50.619 --> 11:55.139
Why don't we launch it here,
do a book reading? What do you think?

11:55.179 --> 11:58.219
It would be good for the store
and it would help my friend Delphine.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.939
Would you like it, Rose?
I'll arrange it.

12:02.259 --> 12:05.099
I would. I'd like it very much.

12:06.539 --> 12:08.859
So, Miss Day, what's the book about?

12:08.899 --> 12:10.699
It's about me!

12:10.739 --> 12:13.619
It's an autobiography,
The Summer House.

12:13.659 --> 12:16.219
You should try writing one.
They're rather fun.

12:16.259 --> 12:18.059
It helps if you've lived a little,

12:18.099 --> 12:21.179
but then I hear you've lived
rather a lot, Mr. Selfridge.

12:21.219 --> 12:23.339
Do you mind if I steal your wife?
Oh...

12:23.379 --> 12:26.779
Shopping's on your own is no fun.
Well, we'd only just sat down so...

12:26.819 --> 12:29.259
What do you want to buy?
I need a new hat.

12:29.299 --> 12:32.659
The hats are wonderful here.
It's lovely to meet you, Harry.

12:32.699 --> 12:35.019
I'll see you later at the house.

12:38.579 --> 12:41.579
Your husband's divine.
He was sweet about the reading.

12:41.619 --> 12:44.659
Wasn't he? I wish I had a man
like that in my pocket.

12:44.699 --> 12:46.699
He's hardly in my pocket, believe me.

12:46.739 --> 12:50.579
No, I want that pattern,
but made up in the blue chiffon.

12:50.619 --> 12:53.819
Delivered by the end of the day.
Can you do it or not?

12:53.859 --> 12:56.379
You'd better say yes if you know
what's good for you!

12:56.419 --> 12:58.259
That should be possible,
Miss Spender.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.619
Charged to Mr. Selfridge's
account as usual?

13:00.659 --> 13:04.139
As usual.
Make sure it's delivered by six.

13:10.819 --> 13:13.499
You see. Nothing changes.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.699
Good morning, Lady Loxley!

13:34.739 --> 13:37.099
The Yardley facial cream
you requested has come in.

13:37.139 --> 13:39.299
Shall I box it up for you?
We're not taking it.

13:43.459 --> 13:47.979
Good morning, Lady Loxley.
The new Lucille handbags are in.

13:48.019 --> 13:51.459
She's designed each one differently,
so no lady will have the same one.

13:51.499 --> 13:53.179
Oh!

13:53.219 --> 13:55.979
Well, I'm not shopping today,
but thank you.

13:57.299 --> 13:59.659
Seems you're well-known here, Mae.

13:59.699 --> 14:02.819
I lead fashion. What do you expect?

14:02.859 --> 14:04.299
Lady Mae!

14:04.339 --> 14:05.939
Lovely to see you.
Oh!

14:05.979 --> 14:07.459
We were just coming to visit you.

14:07.499 --> 14:09.739
I presume you're here for
the anniversary lunch.

14:09.779 --> 14:12.259
Something else she has to pay for?

14:12.299 --> 14:13.979
Excuse me?

14:14.019 --> 14:17.059
May I introduce my husband,
Lord Loxley.

14:17.099 --> 14:20.779
What a pleasure to meet you,
Lord Loxley.

14:21.979 --> 14:25.859
So... This is Selfridge's.

14:26.859 --> 14:31.099
I thought I'd come and see where my
wife spends all her time, and money.

14:33.979 --> 14:36.619
Why don't you both
join us for lunch?

14:36.659 --> 14:40.499
I'm here for business, not pleasure.
I'm closing her account here.

14:40.539 --> 14:42.379
With immediate effect.

14:42.419 --> 14:45.539
Can we discuss this in
Mr. Selfridge's office?

14:45.579 --> 14:48.099
There's nothing to discuss.
The man heard me.

14:50.939 --> 14:52.299
As you wish, sir.

14:52.339 --> 14:55.939
I'll have Mr. Crabb send you a note
with the outstanding sum.

14:55.979 --> 14:59.819
You won't get another penny from me,
Selfridge. Is that clear?

14:59.859 --> 15:01.899
Come along, Mae.

15:02.899 --> 15:05.339
I said, come on.
Don't talk to her like that.

15:07.539 --> 15:11.219
I'm her husband.
I'll speak to her any way I please.

15:11.259 --> 15:15.099
No 'gentleman' treats a lady
like that in my store.

15:15.139 --> 15:17.659
Are you suggesting
I'm NOT a gentleman?

15:17.699 --> 15:19.379
Enough. Enough.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.299
Come.

15:30.899 --> 15:34.659
Well, that little scene may have
amused you, but it was foolish.

15:34.699 --> 15:37.259
Mr. Selfridge is a friend of mine.
A lover?

15:38.259 --> 15:39.819
Don't be ridiculous...

15:42.299 --> 15:44.899
Don't push me, Mae.

16:01.041 --> 16:02.681
Tidying up?

16:02.721 --> 16:05.601
I used outside display artists,
so no-one's been in here.

16:05.641 --> 16:07.641
Let's have a proper look at you.

16:08.774 --> 16:10.214
VoilÃ .

16:10.254 --> 16:12.734
Very Parisian.

16:13.814 --> 16:17.734
You were, you were so kind
to send me to Paris, Mr. Selfridge.

16:17.774 --> 16:20.094
I hope you're going to think
it was all worth it.

16:20.134 --> 16:21.774
I know I will.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.574
I've seen your portfolio, it's good.

16:25.574 --> 16:27.814
Well, I'm glad to be back.

16:27.854 --> 16:32.174
What you said about success meaning
nothing without loyalty and love,

16:32.214 --> 16:34.374
I know what you mean.

16:34.414 --> 16:37.374
I missed my brother,
and everyone here and...

16:37.414 --> 16:41.254
And in Paris, there's erm...
There's an awful lot of talk of war.

16:41.294 --> 16:45.414
It's very troubling, isn't it?
I just wanted to be home.

16:45.454 --> 16:47.454
Does the store feel
like home to you?

16:47.494 --> 16:48.934
Completely.

16:48.974 --> 16:51.734
Then I've done something right
in the past five years.

16:51.774 --> 16:53.454
So...

16:53.494 --> 16:56.534
Head of Display.
Are you ready for the challenge?

16:56.574 --> 16:59.334
I can't wait to get started,
Mr. Selfridge.

16:59.374 --> 17:02.814
I'm organizing this reading because
Delphine Day is a friend of my wife.

17:02.854 --> 17:06.294
THE Delphine Day,
the one who's in all the magazines?

17:06.334 --> 17:09.094
Her reputation's
crossed the Channel?

17:09.134 --> 17:12.733
Men all over Europe
will be shivering in their shoes.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.854
You sure have grown up, haven't you?

17:18.013 --> 17:20.773
Miss Ravillious left us
last year to travel abroad,

17:20.814 --> 17:22.934
so we have a new Fashion buyer.

17:22.973 --> 17:24.054
Mr. Thackeray.

17:24.094 --> 17:27.374
I'd like you to meet our new
Head of Display, Agnes Towler.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.854
Goodness me! The senior staff
get younger every day.

17:29.894 --> 17:34.574
Miss Towler just finished a two-year
secondment at Galleries Lafayette.

17:34.614 --> 17:38.014
Ah. Might I ask where you trained
previously, Miss Towler?

17:38.054 --> 17:40.134
Oh, just here. Under Henri Leclair.

17:40.174 --> 17:43.294
I meant, which art college
did you attend?

17:43.334 --> 17:46.734
Oh. I didn't attend college.
I learnt on the job.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.534
Oh. How refreshing.

17:49.574 --> 17:52.014
Well, I'll let you two
get on with it.

17:52.054 --> 17:56.294
Get on with what, Mr. Selfridge?
Book reading, here, Delphine Day.

17:56.334 --> 17:59.454
Here? In Fashion?
What about the Book Department?

17:59.494 --> 18:02.934
She's such a stylish woman,
it felt only right to do it here.

18:02.974 --> 18:06.374
We'll dress her in our clothes.
Give the reading a design motif.

18:06.414 --> 18:09.054
Yes, and you'll oversee the design.

18:09.094 --> 18:11.814
Help her out on the fashion side.
I must get going.

18:11.854 --> 18:15.854
Mr. Selfridge, what's the book called?
The Summer House.

18:17.134 --> 18:18.854
Sounds exciting.

18:18.894 --> 18:21.174
This wouldn't have happened
at Harrods!

18:21.214 --> 18:23.494
I always create my own
departmental displays.

18:23.534 --> 18:27.774
Mr. Selfridge likes for the heads
of Departments to collaborate.

18:27.814 --> 18:29.334
So...

18:29.374 --> 18:33.174
Erm, well, I'll come up with
a design idea by the end of the day

18:33.214 --> 18:34.934
and then we can talk.

18:34.974 --> 18:36.774
There's nothing to talk about.

18:39.334 --> 18:41.374
If that's how you like to work.

18:43.334 --> 18:45.374
Nice to meet you, Mr. Thackeray.

18:49.574 --> 18:51.494
We need the white wine.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.654
Excuse me. Sorry.

18:54.694 --> 18:57.574
Is erm... Is Victor Colleano about?

18:58.574 --> 19:03.254
He's overseeing the lunch.
You're Agnes Towler, aren't you?

19:03.294 --> 19:06.254
I'm Victor's cousin, Franco.
Franco!

19:06.294 --> 19:09.054
Victor talked
about you all the time.

19:09.094 --> 19:12.134
I saw the post cards
you sent him from Paris.

19:12.174 --> 19:15.694
Oh erm... I wasn't sure he got them.

19:15.734 --> 19:18.014
He's manager of the Palm Court now.

19:18.054 --> 19:20.774
Sounds like he has got an awful lot
on his plate so...

19:20.814 --> 19:23.174
Tell you what,
we're having a party tonight.

19:23.214 --> 19:28.014
Uncle Gio's birthday. Come along.
The old man would love to see you.

19:28.054 --> 19:31.854
Erm, that's very kind, but...
And I'm sure would, too.

19:33.494 --> 19:36.054
Come on, more the merrier!

19:37.174 --> 19:39.454
I'll think about it.

19:46.334 --> 19:48.014
Oh!

19:52.814 --> 19:54.894
Mr. Edwards.
Ah!

19:54.934 --> 19:59.014
We haven't seen you in a long while.
I haven't been here in a long while.

19:59.054 --> 20:02.494
Everything's changed.
This is a whole new counter.

20:02.534 --> 20:06.294
Beauty Products are developing
faster than any other.

20:06.334 --> 20:10.494
They're the future.
Some women need them, others don't.

20:12.094 --> 20:14.894
Wish me luck.
I'm here to see Mr. S on his big day.

20:16.854 --> 20:20.414
Better smarten you up then.
Hmm.

20:30.454 --> 20:31.814
Yes.

20:31.854 --> 20:34.294
May I have a moment, Mr. Grove?

20:34.334 --> 20:35.614
Erm...

20:37.054 --> 20:39.054
Yes. Of course. Do come in.

20:41.494 --> 20:45.494
I was surprised not to see you at
the presentation. Is anything wrong?

20:46.934 --> 20:48.814
I'm going to have to
take some time off.

20:48.854 --> 20:51.694
I thought you should be
first to know as Chief of Staff.

20:54.334 --> 20:58.014
I'm sorry... Do sit down.

20:59.014 --> 21:01.254
Oh! Gosh.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.574
Are you quite well?

21:04.694 --> 21:07.934
You know, family life,
three children under the age of five.

21:07.974 --> 21:10.054
A full night's sleep
seems a distant memory.

21:12.334 --> 21:14.974
May I know the reason
for your requested leave?

21:16.854 --> 21:19.734
My brother is dying, in Geneva.

21:19.774 --> 21:21.294
I need to be with him.

21:23.374 --> 21:25.134
I'm so sorry.

21:25.174 --> 21:27.134
I know you're very fond of him.

21:27.174 --> 21:29.774
I'll talk to the Chief,
but I'm sure it won't be a problem.

21:29.814 --> 21:33.134
You should make arrangements
to leave as soon as you need to.

21:35.654 --> 21:37.134
Thank you, Mr. Grove.

21:39.414 --> 21:42.894
Another journalist, Mr. Selfridge,
from the News Chronicle.

21:42.934 --> 21:46.174
I've done enough interviews
for the day. Tell the man 'no'.

21:46.214 --> 21:47.534
Harry?

21:49.654 --> 21:52.494
Frank! Frank Edwards.

21:52.534 --> 21:53.894
Thank you, Miss Plunkett.

21:53.934 --> 21:58.214
My paymasters insisted, as I did the
very first interview five years ago,

21:58.254 --> 22:01.494
but look, if it's a problem,
the play and all that?

22:01.534 --> 22:04.374
No, no, no.
I set myself up for that one.

22:04.414 --> 22:08.774
I was fair game, but I'm not going
to give you the opportunity again.

22:08.814 --> 22:12.574
The soul of discretion, eh?
Something like that.

22:14.094 --> 22:17.014
It's good to see you.
Good to see you, too.

22:19.734 --> 22:23.214
So, I heard you went to America
to write a novel.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.574
I wrote it and nobody read it,

22:25.614 --> 22:28.574
so I'm back here,
freelancing for the broadsheets.

22:28.614 --> 22:30.334
Hmm.

22:30.374 --> 22:33.414
Well, let's talk.
You've got five minutes.

22:43.374 --> 22:45.414
What's the matter, George?

22:46.414 --> 22:50.734
I can't get used to you, that's all.
You look like a proper lady.

22:50.774 --> 22:54.014
George!
I'm the same old Agnes.

22:54.054 --> 22:57.614
You're coming to this party then?
Franco said he'd asked you.

22:57.654 --> 22:59.494
Erm, I don't know.

22:59.534 --> 23:02.374
I haven't seen Victor
and his family in so long.

23:02.414 --> 23:05.494
He's more your friend than mine.
Don't be silly, Agnes.

23:05.534 --> 23:08.774
He'd love to see you. Come on.

23:08.814 --> 23:11.654
All right, then. Just for a bit.

23:19.174 --> 23:22.254
Gordon! Ah, here you are!

23:22.294 --> 23:24.734
Oh!
Steady on.

23:24.774 --> 23:26.654
Good to see you, son.
Hello.

23:26.694 --> 23:29.094
What do they feed you
at that school?

23:29.134 --> 23:31.214
Every time I see you,
you've grown inches!

23:31.254 --> 23:33.614
Next time he'll be
taller than you, Harry.

23:33.654 --> 23:36.294
There won't be a next time, I hope.

23:39.614 --> 23:41.774
I'm not going back next term.
Oh, Gordon!

23:41.814 --> 23:44.294
I've had enough.
I'm not the academic type.

23:44.334 --> 23:46.774
You would be if you tried.
I want to work at the store.

23:46.814 --> 23:50.254
No, no, absolutely not.

23:50.294 --> 23:53.694
Hear him out, he's got a point.
The store's going to be his one day.

23:53.734 --> 23:56.574
He might as well start working
sooner than later.

23:56.614 --> 23:59.334
Harry, he's too young.
He's 15, Rose.

23:59.374 --> 24:01.814
I was book keeping
by the time I was his age.

24:01.854 --> 24:04.574
But, he's not you!
He needs to find his own way.

24:04.614 --> 24:06.414
That's what I'm trying to do.

24:06.454 --> 24:09.534
Look, he doesn't want
to go back to school.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.574
I'm not gonna waste
time and money on this.

24:11.614 --> 24:13.774
You've already talked about this,
haven't you?

24:13.814 --> 24:16.614
You weren't here.
You've agreed to it.

24:16.654 --> 24:20.014
He feels very strongly about this.
Well, so do I.

24:20.054 --> 24:22.174
It's a bad decision.

24:42.334 --> 24:45.254
George, my boy, you came!

24:45.294 --> 24:47.614
And you brought
a beautiful girl with you!

24:47.654 --> 24:50.254
It's Agnes, Uncle Gio, Agnes Towler.

24:50.294 --> 24:52.214
Agnes!

24:53.614 --> 24:56.094
I didn't recognize you!

24:56.134 --> 24:58.894
How are you?
Me? I'm dying.

24:58.934 --> 25:01.214
Any day now, I will be gone.

25:01.254 --> 25:03.454
You want to stop saying that,
it might come true!

25:03.494 --> 25:04.814
Let's go and join the party.

25:13.894 --> 25:18.334
Things have changed since you left,
but he picked himself up.

25:20.214 --> 25:23.974
He's a good boy, he works hard,
he and Gabriella.

25:24.014 --> 25:26.094
They run the restaurant for me.

25:26.134 --> 25:28.294
He isn't afraid of good, hard work.

25:28.334 --> 25:29.494
Gabriella?

25:29.534 --> 25:33.254
The daughter of my oldest friend.
She has come to live with us.

25:33.294 --> 25:35.814
She's good for Victor.

25:38.614 --> 25:41.414
Don't they make
a lovely couple?

25:43.134 --> 25:45.294
It's good to see you. Happy birthday.

25:45.334 --> 25:48.774
Gracias. Come on, come and join us.
Have some food, huh?

25:50.414 --> 25:52.054
Are you OK, Agnes?

25:52.094 --> 25:54.934
Erm, I think I'm going to
slip away, George.

25:54.974 --> 25:58.254
But we've just got here!
I've just got a busy day tomorrow.

25:58.294 --> 26:02.414
Mr. Selfridge is counting on me.
You stay though. You enjoy yourself.

26:02.454 --> 26:04.094
You sure?
Yeah.

26:07.134 --> 26:08.614
Agnes!

26:11.174 --> 26:12.814
Leaving already?

26:12.854 --> 26:15.654
Hello, Victor. Yes, I...

26:15.694 --> 26:18.854
I was just a bit tired, that's all.

26:20.694 --> 26:22.054
So, how was Paris?

26:23.054 --> 26:25.414
Wonderful. I learnt a lot.

26:25.454 --> 26:28.934
You've got what you always wanted.
Head of Display.

26:28.974 --> 26:32.214
I couldn't have
turned Paris down, Victor.

26:32.254 --> 26:36.534
No. Of course you couldn't.
It was the right decision to go.

26:36.574 --> 26:41.014
But, it was a hard decision,
don't think that it wasn't...

26:41.054 --> 26:42.494
I'm not criticizing you.

26:44.814 --> 26:48.694
You got what you wanted.
Head of, head of Palm Court...

26:48.734 --> 26:50.614
I know that.

26:51.814 --> 26:55.134
Things have worked out for the best.
I couldn't be happier.

26:55.174 --> 26:56.654
Nor could I.

26:58.574 --> 26:59.934
Good night.

27:01.094 --> 27:02.574
Night.

27:17.079 --> 27:20.319
First day at work,
Master Selfridge? That's it.

27:20.359 --> 27:22.619
Is he a chip off
the old block, sir?

27:22.718 --> 27:25.758
That remains to be seen.

27:25.893 --> 27:29.053
Will I have a desk in your office?
You won't have a desk at all.

27:29.093 --> 27:31.853
You'll start in the loading bay.
The loading bay?

27:31.893 --> 27:35.373
Yes. It'll give you a chance
to see all the departments.

27:36.413 --> 27:39.293
Morning, George.
Morning, Mr. Selfridge.

27:39.333 --> 27:42.213
This is Mr. Towler,
our Internal Distribution Manager.

27:42.253 --> 27:43.653
He'll show you the ropes.

27:43.693 --> 27:46.373
Give him an overall.
I'll leave him in your hands.

27:46.413 --> 27:49.573
You won't be needing that,
Master Selfridge.

27:51.453 --> 27:56.253
Best pop this on you. Don't want to
ruin that lovely suit now, do we?

27:56.293 --> 27:58.133
Come on.

27:58.173 --> 28:01.733
First things first.
I'll take you to meet everyone.

28:02.973 --> 28:06.133
May I ask how long
you intend to stay in town?

28:07.133 --> 28:08.413
Quite a while.

28:10.773 --> 28:13.053
Couldn't you be
a little more precise?

28:13.093 --> 28:14.693
No.

28:20.493 --> 28:23.213
I'm going out now.

28:23.253 --> 28:25.933
Where to?
House of Lords.

28:27.653 --> 28:29.853
You haven't been there for years.

28:29.893 --> 28:32.093
Trouble's brewing.

28:32.133 --> 28:35.333
All this talk of war.
Time I did my bit.

28:50.973 --> 28:52.693
Hello?

29:08.053 --> 29:11.373
Rose!
So this is Delphine's.

29:15.093 --> 29:18.173
It's all so wonderfully decadent.

29:18.213 --> 29:20.253
That's entirely the point!

29:24.293 --> 29:26.533
Oh, look at this.

29:33.613 --> 29:37.293
Is it what you expected?
I didn't know what to expect.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.893
Come through to my office
and we'll have a drink.

29:39.933 --> 29:42.893
I was making one when you arrived.
It's a bit early.

29:42.933 --> 29:45.733
Depends on where you imagine
yourself to be.

29:45.773 --> 29:48.453
The sun is over the yardarm
in Singapore,

29:48.493 --> 29:51.013
so let's have a Singapore Sling!

29:58.653 --> 30:03.413
Beneath all that charm, there is
a shrewd businesswoman I suspect!

30:03.453 --> 30:08.053
Well, don't tell anyone!
If it gets out, I'm finished.

30:13.733 --> 30:17.853
So, how did you start this place?
It was after husband number three.

30:17.893 --> 30:19.613
The Spanish Count?

30:19.653 --> 30:22.173
Darling, that was
husband number two.

30:22.213 --> 30:23.973
I'm sorry, I do get mixed up.

30:24.013 --> 30:27.813
Husband number three was
the thoroughly respectable financier

30:27.853 --> 30:31.693
who suddenly dropped down dead,
leaving me nothing.

30:31.733 --> 30:34.293
How extremely inconvenient of him!

30:34.333 --> 30:37.653
Except for the lease
on this property.

30:40.893 --> 30:44.733
You know, I used to run
a business enterprise in Chicago,

30:44.773 --> 30:46.773
before I married Harry.

30:46.813 --> 30:48.093
Really?

30:48.133 --> 30:52.893
We built villas and we sold them
to artists' families.

30:52.933 --> 30:54.613
At a low price, knowing you.

30:54.653 --> 30:58.653
That was kind of the point,
but, gosh it was fun.

30:58.693 --> 31:00.853
And do you have fun now?

31:02.293 --> 31:05.093
Mmm. Maybe not enough.

31:05.133 --> 31:08.653
Let's drink to more fun, then.
Let's.

31:21.853 --> 31:23.013
What is that?

31:23.053 --> 31:25.853
I don't know, sir, but we received
instructions to put it up.

31:25.893 --> 31:29.093
What instructions?
They haven't come from me.

31:40.093 --> 31:44.533
Miss Towler. Some monstrosity
has been erected in my department.

31:44.573 --> 31:47.413
It has your name to it,
but I presume it's a mistake.

31:47.453 --> 31:49.373
Oh, it's arrived!

31:50.533 --> 31:52.173
Wonderful!

32:07.853 --> 32:11.773
Mae, how lovely to see you.

32:11.813 --> 32:14.933
I don't want to disturb.
You're not disturbing at all.

32:19.613 --> 32:21.333
Tell me, how are the girls?

32:21.373 --> 32:24.133
Enjoying a very busy
social life in Chicago.

32:24.173 --> 32:27.293
Marvellous. I long to see them
when they come back.

32:28.373 --> 32:30.733
Did Harry tell you about yesterday?

32:30.773 --> 32:34.093
Yesterday? No, I don't think so.
Why? What happened?

32:34.133 --> 32:38.013
Oh no, nothing of any account.
A silly misunderstanding.

32:38.053 --> 32:41.933
But, he did say Lord Loxley
was back in town.

32:41.973 --> 32:44.133
Was that a surprise?

32:44.173 --> 32:46.253
Actually, yes.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.613
It must be difficult, re-adjusting.

32:49.653 --> 32:52.653
My marriage is an exercise
in management.

32:52.693 --> 32:55.973
Which is acceptable,
because, I don't love my husband.

32:57.173 --> 33:00.813
It must be so much more
complicated if you do.

33:09.533 --> 33:11.693
Miss Towler's put the cat
amongst the pigeons.

33:11.733 --> 33:14.413
She must have agreed it
with Mr. Selfridge.

33:14.453 --> 33:15.893
Does anyone know what it is?

33:17.013 --> 33:19.453
I promise you,
once the screens are down

33:19.493 --> 33:22.093
and it's properly dressed,
it will look wonderful.

33:22.133 --> 33:24.093
I don't care if it looks
like the Taj Mahal.

33:24.133 --> 33:25.773
You did this without consulting me.

33:25.813 --> 33:29.013
You made it quite clear you didn't
want to get involved so...

33:29.053 --> 33:32.093
The reading is tomorrow and I don't
have time to consult everyone.

33:32.133 --> 33:35.213
Come to this reading with us, Mae.
Oh, that's kind.

33:35.253 --> 33:38.333
But, listening to Delphine Day
drone on about her lovers

33:38.373 --> 33:40.693
isn't my idea of a jolly morning.

33:40.733 --> 33:43.893
I disapprove of this fad
for indiscretion.

33:43.933 --> 33:46.013
Miss Day is a new friend of Rose's.

33:47.893 --> 33:49.053
Oh.

33:49.093 --> 33:53.493
We met on the boat coming over.
She's a lot of fun.

33:53.533 --> 33:57.533
Hmm, well, all I can say is,
be careful.

33:57.573 --> 34:00.573
Well, I'm enjoying her company.

34:00.613 --> 34:03.413
I don't see anything
wrong with that.

34:04.573 --> 34:08.572
I am sure you two have something
you need to talk about so...

34:08.612 --> 34:10.333
If you'll excuse me, Mae.

34:11.813 --> 34:13.493
Oh dear.

34:13.533 --> 34:15.373
Oh. I put my foot in it.

34:15.413 --> 34:18.893
It's not you, it's me.
We had an argument about Gordon.

34:18.933 --> 34:21.373
I don't think she's forgiven me.
Oh...

34:22.493 --> 34:27.053
Harry, I wanted to apologise
for Loxley's behavior.

34:27.092 --> 34:30.572
Well, he isn't quite
so unreasonable, usually.

34:30.612 --> 34:33.572
Please, don't worry.
I was just more concerned about you.

34:33.612 --> 34:36.293
Oh. I can look after myself.

34:37.413 --> 34:39.053
But, thank you anyway.

34:39.092 --> 34:42.293
If you need my help,
you know where I am.

34:43.813 --> 34:45.612
Thank you.

34:56.853 --> 34:58.693
Are you all right?

35:01.493 --> 35:03.573
Do you want a hand?
No!

35:03.613 --> 35:06.253
No, no, thanks. I can do it.

35:08.693 --> 35:10.533
Suit yourself.

35:31.655 --> 35:33.735
The clothes for Miss Day.

35:35.441 --> 35:38.201
Thank you. They're...

35:38.241 --> 35:39.921
They're perfect.

35:45.841 --> 35:48.761
It says here, she's had affairs
with hundreds of men.

35:48.801 --> 35:51.361
No! Let's have a look.
Foreigners, lots of them.

35:51.401 --> 35:54.641
Miss Calthorpe,
back to your station.

36:00.681 --> 36:03.681
Miss Day. What are you hoping to
achieve with your new book?

36:03.721 --> 36:06.881
I want people to enjoy it,
that's the important thing.

36:13.761 --> 36:16.481
Good morning, Miss Day.
Good morning.

36:16.521 --> 36:20.641
Are you looking for
something particular?

36:20.681 --> 36:22.441
No, I'm just browsing.

36:22.481 --> 36:25.201
Can I suggest you try
this new scent?

36:25.241 --> 36:28.001
It's Guerlain, L'Heure Bleu.

36:28.041 --> 36:29.761
I love that.

36:29.801 --> 36:31.681
If you'll allow me.

36:38.121 --> 36:39.601
Oh. I love it.

36:39.641 --> 36:41.241
What's in it?

36:41.281 --> 36:43.441
It has a floral bouquet,

36:43.481 --> 36:48.641
bergamot, aniseed and a velvety base
of vanilla and Tonka bean.

36:48.681 --> 36:51.081
I'll get it boxed up for you.

37:02.801 --> 37:06.601
We missed yesterday's late edition
because we had so little notice.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.961
I hope people are going to come.

37:09.001 --> 37:10.561
We'll see.

37:17.921 --> 37:20.281
Where did they all come from?

37:23.521 --> 37:25.521
Gentlemen.
Mr. Selfridge.

37:29.081 --> 37:31.361
Miss Towler,
you've done a terrific job.

37:31.401 --> 37:33.761
It looks wonderful.
I couldn't be more proud of you.

37:33.801 --> 37:35.841
It's completely over done.

37:35.881 --> 37:38.201
The girl has no idea
what she's doing.

37:38.241 --> 37:40.881
No, you're wrong. It's brilliant.

37:40.921 --> 37:44.041
Thank you again.
Thank you, Mr. Selfridge.

37:48.641 --> 37:51.801
Well done. You put on a grand show.

37:51.841 --> 37:53.121
Thank you, Victor.

37:54.321 --> 37:57.041
Ladies, shall we get started?

37:59.241 --> 38:00.721
Good luck.

38:16.041 --> 38:18.721
"I heard the door
to the summer house slam.

38:18.761 --> 38:22.641
"I lay exhausted, on the tiger rug.

38:23.681 --> 38:29.321
"He'd had his way with me, but I too
had received my pleasure from him.

38:29.361 --> 38:32.561
"Later that afternoon
when I awoke alone

38:32.601 --> 38:35.121
"from a very deep and
pleasurable sleep,

38:35.161 --> 38:38.121
"the evening sunlight was
penetrating the jasmine.

38:38.161 --> 38:42.601
"Its golden shafts highlighting the
flowers with millions of sparkles...

38:42.641 --> 38:46.321
Do you think, they're actually,
enjoying it?

38:47.681 --> 38:49.281
Goodness knows.

38:49.321 --> 38:52.641
"..memories of our union
flooded my mind's eye..."

38:54.761 --> 38:57.241
Has the reading started?
Yes. Better hurry.

38:57.281 --> 39:00.201
Knowing Delphine Day, she'll be
making it up as she goes along.

39:00.241 --> 39:02.081
Well, I think she's wonderful.

39:02.121 --> 39:05.361
I'd love to go to that club of hers.
Would you now?

39:06.481 --> 39:08.401
Then why don't I take you?

39:12.041 --> 39:15.721
"Draping a silk throw
around my naked shoulders,

39:15.761 --> 39:18.481
"I dashed to the lakeside,
discarded the robe,

39:18.521 --> 39:22.241
"and immersed myself into
the cool glittering waters.

39:23.361 --> 39:28.121
"I felt refreshed and somehow,
more powerful."

39:28.161 --> 39:29.681
What have I missed?

39:29.721 --> 39:32.281
So far, two husbands
and umpteen lovers.

39:32.321 --> 39:34.841
"I poured myself a glass of champagne

39:34.881 --> 39:37.881
"and felt its perfect bubbles
tickle my soul.

39:37.921 --> 39:41.201
"The following morning
I stood at the train station,

39:41.241 --> 39:44.161
"my suitcase by my side.

39:44.201 --> 39:47.681
"I was alone, but free.

39:47.721 --> 39:51.121
"In that moment, I decided,

39:51.161 --> 39:54.041
"I would never tie myself
to a man again.

39:54.081 --> 39:57.361
"My life may be hard,
it may be lonely,

39:57.401 --> 39:59.441
"but I would follow my star.

39:59.481 --> 40:03.401
"I would be a woman, true to myself."

40:31.321 --> 40:34.001
Harry. That was wonderful.
Thank you.

40:34.041 --> 40:37.801
I was thinking that we could
go to the cinema tonight, Rose.

40:37.841 --> 40:41.161
What do you say?
Oh. Delphine's having a party.

40:41.201 --> 40:43.601
I already said I would go.
Oh.

40:44.801 --> 40:46.441
Another time then.

40:46.481 --> 40:48.321
Yeah.

40:56.361 --> 40:58.961
I want to do my bit
for the country.

40:59.001 --> 41:02.401
The Military Procurement Committee
looks interesting.

41:02.441 --> 41:05.121
You can't just swan back
and demand a plum role.

41:05.161 --> 41:08.321
Look, I'd like to help,
but it's not possible.

41:09.641 --> 41:12.361
You haven't changed,
have you, Bunty?

41:12.401 --> 41:14.161
I don't follow.

41:14.201 --> 41:16.881
Do I have to spell it out?

41:18.521 --> 41:20.761
I have a signed statement here.

41:21.881 --> 41:24.801
Young man by the name of Phineas.

41:24.841 --> 41:28.161
Handsome,
if you like that sort of thing.

41:28.201 --> 41:30.841
He's prepared to testify in court,

41:30.881 --> 41:34.321
that you took advantage
of his innocence.

41:45.801 --> 41:47.921
I'll see what I can do.

41:49.441 --> 41:51.481
If you think getting a place
on a committee

41:51.521 --> 41:53.921
will solve your financial bother,
you're wrong.

41:53.961 --> 41:55.641
I'm not in financial bother.

41:55.681 --> 41:58.601
Power has shifted to
the captains of commerce.

41:58.641 --> 42:00.921
People like Harry Selfridge,

42:00.961 --> 42:03.761
whom you apparently insulted
in front of his entire staff.

42:03.801 --> 42:07.401
Good to see you, Egerton.
Look forward to working with you.

42:21.201 --> 42:23.121
How was your day?
Long.

42:23.161 --> 42:26.801
Grab your coat. I'm taking you out.
Is Ma coming?

42:26.841 --> 42:29.801
No, she has plans this evening
with Miss Day.

42:30.801 --> 42:32.961
I wish she could come.

42:33.001 --> 42:36.481
I miss her, and the girls.

42:37.441 --> 42:40.441
I'm going to tell you something
your mother doesn't even know yet.

42:40.481 --> 42:43.921
I am going to do my darndest
to get this family back together.

42:43.961 --> 42:46.081
Come on.

42:51.041 --> 42:53.161
Wonderful book,
I couldn't put it down.

42:53.201 --> 42:55.841
Congratulations, Delphine.
Thank you, darling.

42:55.881 --> 42:58.481
They've read my book
and they like it.

42:58.521 --> 43:00.881
Of course they do, you're brilliant.

43:02.361 --> 43:05.001
To The Summer House!

43:06.041 --> 43:07.761
And to you, for organizing it.

43:19.641 --> 43:22.921
You are an excellent dancer,
Miss Hawkins.

43:22.961 --> 43:24.921
Call me Kitty.

43:24.961 --> 43:28.121
I reckon everyone's
on first name terms in here.

43:28.161 --> 43:31.161
Kitty, and you must call me Frank.

43:31.201 --> 43:34.321
Miss. Another drink.

43:37.041 --> 43:38.801
Cheers.
Cheers.

43:44.561 --> 43:48.041
You've certainly changed,
since I saw you last.

43:48.081 --> 43:49.561
Well, I should hope so!

43:49.601 --> 43:53.641
And the Beauty Department at
Selfridges is just the beginning.

43:54.961 --> 43:57.681
My dream is to work for Coty.

43:57.721 --> 44:02.161
He's so clever. He sells at
all different price points.

44:02.201 --> 44:05.601
His headquarters outside Paris
are called

44:05.641 --> 44:08.361
The City of Perfumes.

44:08.401 --> 44:12.921
You're a clever one, aren't you?
I like ambition in a girl.

44:12.961 --> 44:15.841
But, let's talk about the present.

44:17.801 --> 44:20.001
What are your plans for tonight?

44:25.761 --> 44:29.761
Just because I'm a shop girl you
think you can take advantage of me?

44:29.801 --> 44:34.041
No, no. I just...
I thought you understood.

44:36.121 --> 44:39.161
Understood what exactly?

44:41.561 --> 44:43.881
I'm sorry. I've got this all wrong.

44:51.681 --> 44:57.041
It's been a lovely evening,
but I need to get home. Good night.

44:57.081 --> 44:59.081
Kitty! Miss Hawkins!

45:04.801 --> 45:07.121
I was thinking erm...

45:07.161 --> 45:09.561
Why don't I come in with you?

45:09.601 --> 45:12.521
Come in with me?
At the club!

45:12.561 --> 45:15.401
You said on the boat you were
looking for a partner...

45:15.441 --> 45:17.601
No, darling,
that would be far too risky.

45:17.641 --> 45:20.201
Anyway, your husband
wouldn't approve.

45:20.241 --> 45:23.521
I have my own money,
so he doesn't have to.

45:23.561 --> 45:27.321
Anyway, I don't need his approval.

45:28.321 --> 45:31.041
That's an irresistible thought.

45:34.801 --> 45:36.721
Henri?

45:36.761 --> 45:38.321
What did you say?

45:38.361 --> 45:41.761
I just... I thought I saw
someone I used to know.

45:44.601 --> 45:46.001
Great movie, huh, son?

45:46.041 --> 45:48.321
I'll say.
Thank you for taking me, Pa.

45:48.361 --> 45:51.601
This is Delphine Day's club.

45:51.641 --> 45:55.361
Wait here and I'll see if your
mother wants to come with us.

46:28.001 --> 46:30.961
It's true though!
It's really true.

46:44.001 --> 46:47.121
Archduke
Franz Ferdinand assassinated!

46:47.161 --> 46:50.561
