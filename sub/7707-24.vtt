Oh, come on, everybody,
we'll be late. Let's go.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.007
I got your tie, B.

00:08.009 --> 00:10.843
Don't forget
your baseball mitt, Brian.

00:10.845 --> 00:11.677
How come?

00:11.679 --> 00:13.145
You'll have a better chance

00:13.147 --> 00:14.947
of catching the bridal squid.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.952
On Earth, we don't throw
marine life at weddings.

00:19.954 --> 00:22.221
Then why get married?

00:22.223 --> 00:24.123
Good point.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.791
Hey, Kate..

00:25.793 --> 00:29.995
...give this to the bride
with my regards.

00:29.997 --> 00:33.032
You're not giving away
my Tupperware.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.466
Of course, I'm not.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.535
Tell her to fill it with food.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.671
I love wedding buffets.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.507
You know,
I may be sorry I ask this

00:41.509 --> 00:42.975
but what are you
gonna be doing

00:42.977 --> 00:44.977
while we're gone?

00:44.979 --> 00:46.678
Oh, I don't know.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.281
Between, uh,
Brian's chemistry set

00:49.283 --> 00:51.450
and Willie's
matchbox collection

00:51.452 --> 00:53.652
I'll find something.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.556
I've rented you these tapes..

00:57.558 --> 01:00.426
...ALF, to keep you occupied

01:00.428 --> 01:02.428
and to keep you out of trouble.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.630
Oh, not "Ishtar" again.

01:05.900 --> 01:09.701
No, these are classics,
you've never seen these.

01:09.703 --> 01:13.605
This one is "The Sheik"
with Rudolph Valentino.

01:13.607 --> 01:16.175
And the other one's a film
by Charlie Chaplin.

01:17.645 --> 01:21.246
Kick the TV, Willie,
the color's gone out.

01:21.248 --> 01:25.517
[laughs]
No, these are
black and white movies, ALF.

01:25.519 --> 01:29.388
How am I supposed to see
Rudolph's red nose?

01:29.390 --> 01:30.956
And turn up the sound.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.292
I can't hear the actors.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.194
These movies are silent.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.564
I might as well be reading.

01:39.934 --> 01:42.367
Give 'em a chance, ALF,
you might like 'em.

01:42.369 --> 01:43.602
Come on, guys, let's go.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.306
Oh, some classic, look at that.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.525
Oh, say, hey, Willie Mays.

03:13.527 --> 03:17.062
Is this the obligatory check
on the careless alien call?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.865
Well, yes, actually.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.833
Uh, what are you doing now?

03:21.835 --> 03:24.102
I'm watching the tapes
you left me.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.838
You know, these silent flicks
sort of grow on one.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.541
Well, we'll be home
in just a couple of hours.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.842
Bye.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.051
- Hello, Jake?
- 'Hi, ALF.'

03:39.053 --> 03:40.686
You know how to spell stuff,
don't ya?

03:40.688 --> 03:42.487

03:42.489 --> 03:43.722
Yeah.

03:45.292 --> 03:46.658

'Yo, ALF.'

03:47.528 --> 03:49.228
Yo, Jakernaut.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.063
What do you want?

03:51.065 --> 03:52.731
I need you to help me
write the script

03:52.733 --> 03:54.666
for my silent movie.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.135
Why are you writin'
a silent movie?

03:57.137 --> 03:59.104
'Cause they don't
write themselves.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.539
Listen to this.

You as a sheik with a harem?

04:27.501 --> 04:29.401
Every sheik has a harem.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.536
It's considered chic.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.941
Huh. Hmm.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.243
Maybe I could work
that into the script.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.311
That's what I mean.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.947
I see you more
as a comedy-type guy.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.715
Like Charlie Chaplin?

04:43.717 --> 04:45.284
Like Cousin Itt.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.254
Let's not get too ambitious
on our first movie.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.124
We'll start with Chaplin.

Hey, ALF, is anybody else
gonna get to be in your movie

06:23.617 --> 06:25.484
besides Willie and Kate?

06:25.486 --> 06:26.852
Like who?

06:26.854 --> 06:28.253

And they live
happily ever after.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.989
The end.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.592
Got that?
Fade out, the end.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.294
You didn't type the end.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.730
Because the story
isn't over yet.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.999
Lynn and Brian
didn't get their operations

16:41.001 --> 16:44.469
and the evil landlord
didn't get his just desserts.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.004
Let's save that for the sequel.

16:46.006 --> 16:49.374
Skip dinner, and have
just desserts ourselves.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.910
But what becomes
of the little scamp?

16:52.912 --> 16:56.347
Alright, alright,
we'll finish the film.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.282
What a slave driver.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.084
That's why I'm the director.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.390
<i> (ALF)</i>
<i> The little scamp</i>

<i> Suddenly, Kate comes home.</i>

<i> She'll do it.</i>

<i> (Jake)</i>
<i> Who is it this time?</i>

17:54.607 --> 17:57.475
<i> (ALF)</i>
<i> It's the evil landlord</i>
<i> Colonel Trevor.</i>

17:57.477 --> 17:59.410
<i> When he sees</i>
<i> that the coast is clear</i>

17:59.412 --> 18:01.412

18:05.618 --> 18:07.752
<i> Little does he know</i>
<i> the little scamp</i>

18:07.754 --> 18:09.620

<i> with a camera.</i>

18:09.622 --> 18:11.355
<i> (Jake)</i>
<i> Where'd he get a camera?</i>

18:11.357 --> 18:13.391

<i> From the prop department,</i>

<i> and Lynn's operations</i>

19:13.486 --> 19:16.487

<i> Whitney Houston?</i>

19:21.261 --> 19:22.627
<i> (ALF)</i>
<i> No. It's Lynn.</i>

19:22.629 --> 19:24.795

19:24.797 --> 19:27.398

19:59.766 --> 20:02.733
But what about
Lynn and Brian's operations?

20:02.735 --> 20:05.836
I said, "Fade out. The end."

20:05.838 --> 20:08.706
Uh-huh, I still got
the typewriter.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.576
You know what you are,
Francis Ford Jakola?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.778
You're a stickler for detail.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.547
I hate that in a neighbor.

Okay, Mr. Director

21:27.820 --> 21:30.087
any more loose ends
you wanna tie up

21:30.089 --> 21:32.757
or can we just type,
the end, now?

21:33.993 --> 21:36.460
The end.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.196
Well, this is gonna be
<i> bafo, socko.</i>

21:39.198 --> 21:41.132
A box office bonanza.

21:41.134 --> 21:43.367
It's the greatest story
ever told.

21:43.369 --> 21:46.470
Don't get carried away, ALF,
it's not that good.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.905
Well, not yet.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.908
But once we add sound,
colorize it

21:50.910 --> 21:53.344
and stick Eddie Murphy
in there someplace

I get it. He's pretending
to be in a silent movie.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.014
Hmm.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.416
Alright, sheik, you will now
put every single sheet

22:32.418 --> 22:34.618
and pillow back on the bed
you took it from.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.420
