00:19.680 --> 00:22.228
[theme music playing]

00:39.790 --> 00:41.860
[Hannah]
One last try.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.576
I’m giving life one last t/y.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.290
[Dennis] Good morning, Mr. Dempsey.

00:50.420 --> 00:51.409
Morning.

00:52.210 --> 00:55.839
My name is Dennis Vasquez,
representing Andrew and Olivia Baker,

00:55.930 --> 00:57.249
and this is a deposition.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.256
I'll be asking you questions,

00:59.350 --> 01:01.090
and you must answer them truthfully...

01:01.720 --> 01:04.223
unless your attorney clearly
instructs you otherwise.

01:04.310 --> 01:05.686
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

01:06.230 --> 01:09.358
There's no judge present,
but this is a formal legal proceeding.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.432
You are under the same legal obligation
to tell the truth, the whole truth,

01:12.530 --> 01:14.316
and nothing but the truth.
Do you understand?

01:15.820 --> 01:17.230
Yeah, I understand.

01:17.530 --> 01:18.656
[Dennis] Okay, good.

01:18.740 --> 01:20.822
Uh, for the record,
please state your full name,

01:20.910 --> 01:23.367
your age, where you go to school,

01:23.450 --> 01:24.860
and what year you're in.

01:26.370 --> 01:27.826
[clears throat] I'm, uh...

01:27.920 --> 01:30.127
My name is Zachary Shan-Yung Dempsey.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.952
I'm 17, and I'm a junior at Liberty High.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.291
[Dennis] And when and where did you
first meet Hannah Baker?

01:39.850 --> 01:43.763
I met her at a party, I guess,
right before sophomore year started.

01:44.770 --> 01:46.385
[Dennis] And how well did you know Hannah?

01:48.020 --> 01:48.975
Um...

01:51.900 --> 01:54.562
I didn ’t know her that well at a//.

01:55.690 --> 01:58.022
I mean, I knew her from around school,
I guess,

01:58.110 --> 01:59.486
and she, um...

02:00.120 --> 02:02.111
she dated my friend Just/n for a wh/Ye.

02:04.410 --> 02:07.038
[Dennis] Are you aware of anyone
bullying Hannah?

02:07.120 --> 02:08.667
[Lainie]
Dennis, we're going to object.

02:08.870 --> 02:10.872
That asks him to qualify behavior.

02:12.210 --> 02:15.839
[Dennis] Did you ever hear anyone
say unkind things to Hannah?

02:18.260 --> 02:19.249
Um...

02:19.840 --> 02:22.468
Yes. Yeah, I heard, and, um...

02:24.430 --> 02:26.261
and I said some things myself.

02:29.390 --> 02:30.220
Hey.

02:34.690 --> 02:36.601
There you go. As requested.

02:37.650 --> 02:38.480
And it...

02:39.490 --> 02:43.028
just, like the tapes in my parents' store,
it just records on them?

02:43.120 --> 02:45.361
Yeah, like a voice text on your iPhone,

02:45.450 --> 02:47.156
only with way more style.

02:47.450 --> 02:49.452
May I ask what the project is?

02:50.370 --> 02:52.531
Just this stupid thing.

02:54.540 --> 02:57.509
-Do you mind if I keep it for a few days?
-Keep it as long as you like.

02:57.590 --> 02:58.716
I'll see you in ﬁfth?

02:58.800 --> 03:00.336
-Yeah, see you. Thank you.
-Yeah.

03:06.350 --> 03:08.227
[Hannah]
I recorded 12 tapes.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.385
I started with Jusdn.

03:11.270 --> 03:12.305
Then Jess/ca.

03:13.230 --> 03:14.720
Who each broke my heart.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.738
-Hey. It's Hannah. Hannah Baker.
'A/E/Y, 7'y/er, Courtney, Marcus,

03:19.820 --> 03:21.902
who each helped destroy my reputation.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.979
Did you just...?

03:24.570 --> 03:25.616
It's real tight.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.246
[camera clicking]

03:29.200 --> 03:31.111
0n through Zach and Ryan...

03:31.790 --> 03:33.280
who broke my spirit

03:35.920 --> 03:37.410
Through tape number .72...

03:40.260 --> 03:41.158
Bryce Walker...

03:43.010 --> 03:44.466
who broke my soul.

03:46.850 --> 03:49.557
But a funny thing happened
as I finished number 12.

03:51.890 --> 03:54.393
I felt something... shiﬁ‘.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.430
I had poured it all out. ..

04:00.690 --> 04:02.066
and for a minute.. .

04:02.990 --> 04:04.150
just a minute.. .

04:05.030 --> 04:07.328
I felt like maybe I could beat this.

04:11.330 --> 04:13.707
I decided to give life one more chance.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.121
But this bme, I was asking for help...

04:17.710 --> 04:20.087
because I know I can ’t do it alone.

04:20.170 --> 04:21.125
I know that now.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.040
Good morning.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.080
Good morning, sunshine.

04:25.180 --> 04:28.638
-You look radiant today.
-I do not.

04:29.220 --> 04:32.383
I need one more cassette for my project.
Is it okay if I just grab it?

04:32.480 --> 04:34.300
Yeah, go ahead, sweetie.
Anything you need.

04:34.390 --> 04:37.609
Just put it down on the inventory,

04:37.690 --> 04:40.102
which no one bothers to look at

04:40.190 --> 04:43.489
-when they call the distributor anyway.
-I told you, they only allow for...

04:43.570 --> 04:45.526
Of course, if you ’re listening to this,

04:45.610 --> 04:47.658
-I fa_/led.
[indistinct arguing]

04:47.740 --> 04:50.368
Or he faded and my fate is sealed.

04:53.330 --> 04:54.570
Okay, Mom, I'm off.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.116
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Hey.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.702
When do we get to hear about this project?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.291
You don't. It's stupid. Don't even worry.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.580
Nothing you do is stupid.

05:04.670 --> 05:05.796
I mean it.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.508
Okay, uh... Mom, please. No.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.170
-I have to go.
-All right. I love you.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.090
Thank you.

05:12.390 --> 05:13.300
Have a good day.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.469
[Hannah] Thank you!

05:20.980 --> 05:22.857
[Mr. Baker]
Lorene will be here any minute.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.350
She's good to work all day.

05:25.070 --> 05:26.389
But...

05:27.070 --> 05:28.697
are you sure you want
to sit through these?

05:28.780 --> 05:31.783
Dennis says they're just
mostly procedural at this point.

05:32.740 --> 05:33.650
I'm sure.

05:34.370 --> 05:35.701
We should both be there.

05:36.620 --> 05:39.578
Someone has to meet the realtor
at the house this afternoon.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.126
We'll reschedule.

05:41.210 --> 05:43.508
We have to get the house
listed this month.

05:43.590 --> 05:44.579
We'll reschedule.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.922
I don't know it's necessary
for us to be at every deposition.

05:50.010 --> 05:50.840
I do.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.307
Those kids hurt our daughter.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.596
I want to find out what they know.

05:57.270 --> 06:00.182
Hannah and me, we'd have
a conversation now and then.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.725
[Dennis] Did you ever date Hannah?

06:02.820 --> 06:03.684
No.

06:05.070 --> 06:07.026
I mean, we had a milkshake once.

06:07.110 --> 06:09.738
It was just a Dollar Valentine's thing.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.576
[Dennis] Hannah didn't take it seriously?

06:11.700 --> 06:13.782
-[Lainie] Objection.
-[Dennis] I'll rephrase.

06:13.870 --> 06:16.156
Um, did Hannah ever say anything to you

06:16.250 --> 06:18.821
that might lead you to believe
that she did take it seriously?

06:19.330 --> 06:21.241
Not really. I-I think...

06:23.040 --> 06:24.166
I think...

06:27.510 --> 06:28.795
I might have been...

06:30.090 --> 06:31.842
I might have hurt Hannah's feelings...

06:32.390 --> 06:33.846
a little bit.

06:34.140 --> 06:35.380
But I didn't mean to.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.227
[Dennis] Hurt her feelings how?

06:38.140 --> 06:39.550
I thought she wanted to date me.

06:40.900 --> 06:41.935
She didn't.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.113
Are you giving me the silent treatment,
or is it the other way around?

06:56.080 --> 06:57.616
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

06:58.160 --> 07:00.492
-I'm just eating breakfast.
-You disappeared again.

07:02.670 --> 07:04.581
There are consequences
when you disappear.

07:04.670 --> 07:07.412
I didn't disappear, for fuck's sake.
I was at a friend's house.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.875
-A friend who beat you senseless?
-[door opens]

07:08.970 --> 07:10.540
I told you, I wiped out on my bike.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.086
What, did you land on Mike Tyson?

07:12.180 --> 07:13.249
[door closes]

07:13.930 --> 07:15.841
Look who just pulled up outside.

07:15.930 --> 07:17.807
Tony. Good morning.

07:18.350 --> 07:19.169
Good morning.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.017
Thought Tony might like
to join us for breakfast.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.686
We can all catch up.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.060
Maybe talk about
your depositions tomorrow.

07:27.150 --> 07:29.778
-That would be great.
-Tony doesn't have time. Upstairs.

07:29.860 --> 07:31.066
Clay.

07:31.820 --> 07:34.448
Mom, soon. I promise.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.319
[sighs]

07:38.910 --> 07:40.787
Hey, what the fuck happened to your face?

07:41.750 --> 07:42.705
I'll show you.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.530
This couldn't wait till after school?

07:47.550 --> 07:50.667
[sighs] Copy this tape.
I'll get it from you after homeroom.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.546
-I already have copies.
-No.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.551
Remember how side "B" was blank?

07:57.970 --> 07:58.800
Yeah.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.016
It's not blank anymore.

08:16.830 --> 08:17.649
Me.

08:18.740 --> 08:20.446
She was practically
begging me to fuck her.

08:20.540 --> 08:23.532
If that’s rape, then every girl
at this school wants to be raped.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.160
He fucking confessed.

08:33.930 --> 08:34.919
No.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.591
You didn't give him the tapes, did you?

08:48.230 --> 08:50.027
I gave him the gist of his.

08:51.150 --> 08:54.313
I'm assuming you want to make a copy
of that to keep your set complete.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.150
And then what?

08:57.700 --> 08:59.270
Sheri texted me last night.

09:00.660 --> 09:02.241
She went to the police herself.

09:02.330 --> 09:03.786
-What happened?
-I don't know.

09:03.870 --> 09:06.577
But if she's facing up to it,
and we have Bryce's confession--

09:06.670 --> 09:08.911
What about going through the cycle
like Hannah wanted?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.457
It's time we stop thinking
about what Hannah wanted

09:11.550 --> 09:13.336
and start thinking about what she needs.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.709
And Jessica.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.712
And every other girl who "practically
begged" Bryce to fuck her.

09:18.510 --> 09:19.590
I gotta tell you, Clay,

09:19.680 --> 09:22.217
I am not sure that this
is the right thing to do,

09:22.310 --> 09:23.800
and even if I was,

09:23.890 --> 09:25.630
I don't know where we stand.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.728
We can't be righteous.
We've been sitting on evidence for weeks.

09:29.810 --> 09:31.471
Either we do something now,

09:31.570 --> 09:33.481
or we give it up tomorrow
in that deposition.

09:34.030 --> 09:35.816
There are half a dozen kids
going in there today.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.401
Who knows what happens with them.

09:46.960 --> 09:47.949
This tape...

09:50.920 --> 09:52.490
This tape blows up the world.

09:56.010 --> 09:57.716
Which is what we should do,
don't you think?

09:59.680 --> 10:01.500
[Dennis] Did you consider Hannah a friend?

10:01.890 --> 10:02.959
Not really.

10:03.350 --> 10:05.136
An acquaintance would be more accurate.

10:06.140 --> 10:09.689
[Dennis] Reporter, can you mark
this document as Exhibit three.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.817
Can you tell me who this is in this photo?

10:18.950 --> 10:19.985
It's hard to tell.

10:20.070 --> 10:21.310
That's not you in this photo?

10:21.410 --> 10:23.787
[Mr. Crimsen] I thought we were here
to talk about Hannah.

10:23.870 --> 10:26.577
I'm not sure what you're trying
to pin on my daughter--

10:26.660 --> 10:28.821
[Dennis] Mr. Crimsen,
you're here as a courtesy.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.490
Your daughter is 18.

10:30.580 --> 10:33.128
She can talk about this photo now,
or do it in court.

10:37.670 --> 10:38.796
Thank you for meeting me.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.927
You were the only one
who tried to tell me the truth.

10:45.560 --> 10:46.379
Are you...

10:48.640 --> 10:50.847
I promised myself
that I wasn't going to say

10:51.060 --> 10:53.688
something stupid like "are you okay"

10:53.770 --> 10:54.759
or "how are you doing,"

10:54.860 --> 10:57.146
because, like,
how the fuck do you think, right?

10:57.240 --> 10:58.104
But...

10:59.740 --> 11:00.695
how are you?

11:02.240 --> 11:03.946
How the fuck do you think?

11:05.490 --> 11:06.320
Yeah.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.327
Do you need to... talk to somebody?

11:12.710 --> 11:13.665
See somebody?

11:15.090 --> 11:15.909
VVho?

11:34.230 --> 11:35.561
I'll burn these.

11:36.610 --> 11:39.238
I'll light them on fire
and let them burn until they're...

11:40.610 --> 11:43.101
I don't know, melted plastic and ash.
It's your call.

11:45.410 --> 11:46.866
But if you want to fight...

11:47.620 --> 11:49.497
if you want him to pay you
for what he did,

11:49.580 --> 11:51.707
these tapes can help.
They're proof.

11:51.790 --> 11:55.078
You want me to tell the whole
goddamn world what happened to me?

11:56.130 --> 11:58.086
I want you to do what you want to do.

11:58.670 --> 12:01.969
Whatever's going to make this
better for you, if anything can.

12:03.550 --> 12:04.926
But I'm not gonna lie.

12:06.010 --> 12:07.841
I want him to pay for what he did.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.556
Will he, though?

12:10.930 --> 12:11.885
I mean...

12:12.850 --> 12:14.681
have you listened to the last tape?

12:15.270 --> 12:17.397
You know what happens
when girls try to get help?

12:18.520 --> 12:20.067
I listened to the last tape.

12:22.110 --> 12:24.567
And I think I should pass the tapes on
like Hannah wanted.

12:25.950 --> 12:28.828
I'd have to tell the police,
I'd have to tell my dad.

12:29.990 --> 12:30.820
Yeah.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.529
I don't think I can do that.

12:36.790 --> 12:37.700
Okay.

12:39.340 --> 12:41.205
You think I'm letting Hannah down.

12:43.550 --> 12:45.177
I think we all let Hannah down.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.551
And I think she let you down.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.168
So...

13:03.280 --> 13:04.816
Thanks for talking to me about this.

13:06.490 --> 13:08.026
And I guess let me know
if there's anything...

13:10.240 --> 13:11.446
if there's anything.

13:18.040 --> 13:18.870
Clay.

13:22.550 --> 13:23.960
Don't burn the tapes.

13:27.720 --> 13:28.630
[K617
Look.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.803
The jocks, they walk the halls
like they own the place.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.885
The teachers feed into it.

13:34.140 --> 13:35.721
Bolan feeds into it.

13:36.810 --> 13:38.266
It's just... it's how it is.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.147
[Dennis] But you dated athletes.

13:40.230 --> 13:41.720
[Lainie] Objection. Relevance.

13:41.860 --> 13:43.350
She's here to talk about Hannah Baker.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.067
Yeah. Of course I dated jocks.

13:45.610 --> 13:48.408
There are decent jocks,
you just gotta learn how to find them.

13:50.070 --> 13:51.196
Hannah never learned.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.747
It's not her fault. I mean...

13:54.200 --> 13:56.498
you try going to school
with a bunch of Neanderthals

13:56.580 --> 13:59.322
who are told they are
the only thing of value at school,

13:59.540 --> 14:02.998
and that the rest of us are merely
there to cheer them on

14:03.090 --> 14:06.048
and provide them with whatever
support they need.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.712
[Dennis] So, you texted Hannah
more than once

14:10.800 --> 14:13.052
that she had terrible taste in guys.

14:13.560 --> 14:14.959
What did you mean?

14:15.220 --> 14:16.630
What I meant...

14:18.940 --> 14:19.975
whatI mean...

14:21.360 --> 14:24.477
is that, ifI hadn't moved away...

14:26.190 --> 14:28.852
ifI hadn't let her start dating Justin...

14:30.030 --> 14:32.828
if I'd been around
to help her through it...

14:34.580 --> 14:35.990
she'd still be alive today.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.951
[Dennis] And Justin is Justin Foley?

14:40.330 --> 14:41.410
Yes.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.739
Justin...

14:43.880 --> 14:45.541
is Justin Foley.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.416
[Dennis]
Are you and Justin still friendly?

14:49.180 --> 14:50.750
Justin Foley is dead to me.

14:55.140 --> 14:57.597
Jesus Christ, are you following me?

14:57.680 --> 14:58.726
I have to talk to you.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.142
-Justin!
-Jess, please. I...

15:02.060 --> 15:03.891
I've been walking around all night.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.146
I've got no place to live, okay?

15:06.230 --> 15:07.231
Shit...

15:07.820 --> 15:08.855
Shit's so fucked up.

15:09.610 --> 15:10.565
You think?

15:10.660 --> 15:12.525
-Just talk to me.
-Why, Justin?

15:12.620 --> 15:14.156
Why should I talk to you?

15:15.990 --> 15:16.979
Last night, I...

15:18.330 --> 15:21.242
I walked every street
in this shitty-ass town.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.280
And I ended up by the water,
by the docks.

15:26.090 --> 15:28.797
I climbed up this crane,
all the way up there, and I could...

15:29.630 --> 15:31.211
I could see the whole city.

15:32.300 --> 15:33.631
And I was gonna jump.

15:35.350 --> 15:36.965
Or shoot myself.

15:39.560 --> 15:40.629
But I couldn't.

15:42.350 --> 15:45.569
Because I couldn't stop
thinking about you. I can't stop.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.106
Try harder.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.732
Tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it.

15:52.820 --> 15:54.196
I'll fucking go to the school.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.486
I'll talk to the cops.

15:56.950 --> 15:58.110
I'll kill Bryce.

15:59.580 --> 16:03.243
If you want, I'll kill him with my
bare hands and pay the price.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.491
Just please tell me what you want.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.831
What I want...

16:09.260 --> 16:11.967
is never to see you again in my life.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.219
[engine starts]

16:37.160 --> 16:40.323
All I'm saying is if you throw
like you threw in divisionals last year,

16:40.410 --> 16:41.365
we'll be fine.

16:41.660 --> 16:42.649
Yeah.

16:43.580 --> 16:44.569
I'll be fine.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.161
Never be Jeff Atkins, though.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.087
I fuckin' miss that guy.

16:50.630 --> 16:51.619
He was a good dude.

16:55.010 --> 16:56.830
Aah! Fuck!

16:56.930 --> 16:58.795
Shake it off, man. It's just rust.

16:58.890 --> 17:01.017
Nah, I fucked up my hand last night.

17:03.350 --> 17:04.931
Jesus! Who'd you hit?

17:05.480 --> 17:06.595
Ah, just the wall.

17:06.690 --> 17:08.681
You gotta watch that temper, bro.

17:08.770 --> 17:11.898
You telling me to watch my temper
is like Justin Foley

17:11.980 --> 17:13.607
telling me to lay off the weed.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.485
Where is that guy, anyway?

17:16.200 --> 17:17.189
No clue.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.360
You figure your shit out?

17:20.910 --> 17:21.979
From the other night?

17:23.660 --> 17:25.070
Yeah. Yeah.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.069
Yeah, we're good.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.046
All right, let's go.

17:34.130 --> 17:36.837
[Hannah]
A few days after
I recorded tape 12,

17:36.930 --> 17:39.091
I saw Bryce in the hallway.

17:39.180 --> 17:43.423
[PA]
And congrats to our L/berty Tigers
on their first win of the season!

17:43.520 --> 17:48.719
Game ball goes to Bryce Walker,
12 catches and two touchdowns!

17:49.610 --> 17:52.727
[Hannah]
I thought I could never show
my face at that school again.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.196
Everything was dark for days.

18:04.910 --> 18:05.956
But then. . .

18:07.160 --> 18:08.741
just a little flash of light.

18:15.670 --> 18:18.582
A flash of ﬁght; and you think, maybe...

18:26.430 --> 18:28.978
I feel like, as a society,

18:29.060 --> 18:31.642
our priorities are all out of whack,
you know?

18:31.730 --> 18:32.856
[students cheering]

18:36.650 --> 18:37.776
Yeah.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.025
Clay...

18:43.370 --> 18:44.234
What?

18:49.920 --> 18:52.377
Never mind. I'll see you in Bradley's.

19:15.520 --> 19:16.646
Mr. Porter.

19:17.110 --> 19:17.929
Clay.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.192
What happened? Are you all right?

19:20.360 --> 19:21.520
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

19:21.610 --> 19:22.440
It's just...

19:22.700 --> 19:24.986
I know I'm still on suspension, but I...

19:25.580 --> 19:26.899
I needed to talk.

19:26.990 --> 19:27.820
Is that okay?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.570
Yeah, sure. Come on.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.990
I was glad to see you on my calendar.

19:35.210 --> 19:36.040
Why?

19:37.090 --> 19:40.674
I'm just glad you made
an appointment to come talk.

19:42.590 --> 19:46.094
So, uh... what's on your heart today?

19:48.140 --> 19:49.050
Well, uh...

19:51.810 --> 19:53.095
just everything, I guess.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.349
[cell phone rings]

19:57.190 --> 19:58.316
Okay, every...

19:58.400 --> 19:59.526
everything, huh?

20:01.490 --> 20:03.060
Everything is a lot.

20:04.700 --> 20:07.487
Why don't we start with
how you're feeling right now.

20:10.450 --> 20:11.781
Right now?

20:11.870 --> 20:13.451
Yeah. Right now.

20:19.090 --> 20:19.954
Lost.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.329
I guess.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.256
Sort of empty.

20:24.800 --> 20:25.846
Empty?

20:26.260 --> 20:28.216
Yeah, I don't feel anything.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.095
Like...

20:30.600 --> 20:32.511
I don't care anymore.

20:33.310 --> 20:34.720
You don't care about what?

20:38.190 --> 20:39.771
About anything.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.816
School. Myself.

20:43.650 --> 20:45.151
The people here.

20:46.620 --> 20:47.939
My parents.

20:48.910 --> 20:50.150
Your parents?

20:51.870 --> 20:54.498
I mean, I care about them,
but I'm not...

20:55.880 --> 20:58.030
I'm not who they need me to be.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.415
Well, who do they need you to be?

21:08.600 --> 21:10.591
Not... a problem.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.470
Really?

21:15.690 --> 21:19.057
Well, how are you a problem to them?

21:23.070 --> 21:23.889
I don't know.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.230
[cell phone vibrates]

21:26.910 --> 21:28.480
You can get that if you want.

21:28.570 --> 21:30.231
Uh, no.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.072
No, uh... [clears throat]

21:33.410 --> 21:35.787
Listen, what about your friends?

21:36.960 --> 21:38.780
Do you care about them?

21:40.290 --> 21:41.291
Fnends?

21:42.550 --> 21:43.756
What friends?

21:43.840 --> 21:45.831
Now, I know you have friends.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.329
I see you in the halls.

21:47.930 --> 21:48.749
Yeah, well--

21:51.810 --> 21:53.425
Alex Standall.

21:54.270 --> 21:56.682
And I've seen you around
with Courtney Crimsen.

21:56.770 --> 21:58.089
They're not my friends.

21:58.770 --> 22:00.180
What about Clay Jensen?

22:05.530 --> 22:07.395
Clay Jensen hates me.

22:13.700 --> 22:14.689
[Mr. Porter] Clay.

22:16.330 --> 22:17.536
Clay.

22:24.420 --> 22:25.967
So what's on your mind today?

22:29.430 --> 22:31.796
I wanted to talk about Hannah Baker.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.096
She pushed me away.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.840
I was thinking about how hurt I was,

22:39.940 --> 22:43.512
and I didn't even for a minute
stop to think that...

22:45.230 --> 22:46.640
she was hurting too.

22:47.030 --> 22:48.691
Look, Clay...

22:51.870 --> 22:54.657
between you and her, with other kids,

22:54.740 --> 22:57.447
she made that choice to take her own life.

22:57.790 --> 22:58.609
But why?

23:00.290 --> 23:01.700
Why did she make that choice?

23:02.380 --> 23:04.120
We can't know that for sure.

23:04.670 --> 23:05.910
What if we could?

23:08.130 --> 23:10.086
What if we knew what we did wrong?

23:12.050 --> 23:14.132
I don't think Clay Jensen hates you.

23:14.350 --> 23:16.215
I don't know him all that well,

23:16.310 --> 23:18.722
but he doesn't seem the type
to hate anyone.

23:21.100 --> 23:24.012
It's like it doesn't
even matter what you say.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.896
Maybe it does. I don't know.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.560
[Mr. Porter]
Okay, I'm not following you.

23:32.410 --> 23:33.445
You know what?

23:34.620 --> 23:35.575
Never mind.

23:36.620 --> 23:38.360
Wait, hang on. Don't go. Just...

23:38.450 --> 23:39.860
Just help me out here.

23:39.960 --> 23:40.779
Please.

23:47.420 --> 23:48.830
When you leave this office...

23:49.840 --> 23:52.172
how would you like things
to be different for Hannah?

23:59.770 --> 24:01.055
I don't know. I...

24:01.810 --> 24:03.641
I'm not sure what I'm expecting.

24:03.730 --> 24:04.970
All right.

24:05.060 --> 24:09.144
Well, it sounds like there's
something that you need

24:09.230 --> 24:10.527
that you're not getting.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.526
So, let's start there.

24:20.410 --> 24:21.820
I need it to stop.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.495
You need what to stop?

24:30.920 --> 24:33.081
[voice quavering]
I need everything to stop.

24:37.300 --> 24:38.130
Just...

24:38.720 --> 24:40.460
People. Life.

24:41.140 --> 24:42.266
Life?

24:46.980 --> 24:50.143
You know, it's natural
to blame yourself, but...

24:51.190 --> 24:52.942
we all do the best we can.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.406
I think that's bullshit.

24:54.490 --> 24:57.778
I think we should blame ourselves.
I think we all could do better.

24:57.870 --> 25:01.033
We can try to love each other better,

25:01.200 --> 25:03.031
but we're imperfect people.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.782
We love imperfectly.
We don't always get it right.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.958
How can you just live with that?
I mean, you're a counselor.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.450
I have to live with it.

25:10.550 --> 25:14.259
You can know all the signs
and understand the issues,

25:14.340 --> 25:16.171
and still come up missing something.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.096
That's not good enough.

25:19.140 --> 25:21.517
What about the next kid
who wants to kill himself?

25:22.850 --> 25:24.477
Do you think about hurting yourself?

25:26.480 --> 25:28.801
The other night,
I almost threw myself off a cliff.

25:31.570 --> 25:32.810
I'm glad you didn't.

25:33.780 --> 25:35.395
You may not feel that way in a minute.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.275
Why do you say that?

25:42.910 --> 25:45.037
Hannah Baker came to see you
the day she died.

25:47.250 --> 25:48.376
[sobs softly]

25:48.460 --> 25:49.449
Hannah.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.758
What did you mean when you said
you needed life to stop?

25:55.260 --> 25:56.921
I don't know.

25:57.970 --> 26:00.791
'Cause that seems like
a very serious thing to say.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.017
I know. I... I'm sorry.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.135
I didn't mean...

26:05.520 --> 26:07.260
that, I guess.

26:08.770 --> 26:10.101
So what happened, Hannah?

26:10.940 --> 26:12.567
How did you get here?

26:14.940 --> 26:15.770
Just...

26:16.490 --> 26:18.811
one thing on top of another.

26:19.620 --> 26:20.860
If I'm gonna help you,

26:20.950 --> 26:23.282
I'm gonna need you to be a little
more specific.

26:26.660 --> 26:29.037
I'm sure you've heard some
of the rumors about me.

26:29.750 --> 26:30.819
[phone vibrates]

26:34.960 --> 26:38.088
I haven't, actually.
What do these rumors say?

26:43.470 --> 26:45.597
actually, not voted.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.380
Someone made this stupid list.

26:49.730 --> 26:51.857
"Best of, worst of" thing.

26:55.070 --> 26:57.777
And people have been
reacting to it ever since.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.401
When was the last time?

27:02.530 --> 27:03.610
A week ago.

27:05.700 --> 27:06.530
At a party.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.780
What happened at the party?

27:10.960 --> 27:12.575
She told you what happened to her.

27:12.670 --> 27:15.457
Look, even if she did come to visit me...

27:16.260 --> 27:18.080
this is not something I can talk about.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.549
So, if I tell you that I'm going
to kill myself, you can't tell anyone?

27:22.680 --> 27:24.671
Yes, I can tell your parents.

27:26.100 --> 27:28.762
You know, I can tell who I need to tell

27:29.140 --> 27:31.188
in order to get you
the right medical attention.

27:31.730 --> 27:33.186
Did you tell anyone about Hannah?

27:33.270 --> 27:36.398
Hannah never told me she was
thinking about killing herself.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.311
-But you did see her.
-I didn't say that.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.276
You saw her.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.481
And she told you things were bad.

27:43.160 --> 27:45.947
That she didn't care about anything,
that she wanted everything to stop.

27:46.030 --> 27:47.327
When did you talk to her last?

27:47.410 --> 27:49.401
She told you how she got to that point.

27:52.330 --> 27:53.410
[Mr. Porter]
Was there...

27:55.130 --> 27:59.089
Did you have an encounter at the party?

28:00.420 --> 28:01.580
An encounter?

28:03.640 --> 28:05.961
Yeah, you could say that.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.135
Did...

28:12.560 --> 28:14.221
You don't want to talk about this.

28:14.310 --> 28:15.607
No, I do.

28:16.650 --> 28:19.187
Listen, Hannah, I'm not gonna judge you...

28:20.240 --> 28:22.947
but did anything happen that night
that you regret?

28:25.320 --> 28:26.230
Yes.

28:27.740 --> 28:30.288
Are you embarrassed by what happened?

28:33.710 --> 28:34.529
Yes.

28:35.420 --> 28:37.331
Maybe you made a decision?

28:37.420 --> 28:38.739
No, I...

28:38.840 --> 28:41.126
A decision to do something
with a boy that now you regret.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.633
Oh, my God, no!
That's just what you assume?

28:44.720 --> 28:45.926
No, I'm just asking you.

28:46.010 --> 28:48.422
-I didn't make a decision.
-[phone rings]

28:50.470 --> 28:52.176
Okay. Sorry.

28:52.850 --> 28:53.976
Um...

28:54.480 --> 28:58.393
Did anything happen at the party
that may be considered illegal?

28:59.400 --> 29:00.219
Maybe.

29:00.320 --> 29:03.312
-Alcohol?
-Yeah, but I wasn't drinking.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.230
Drugs?

29:06.410 --> 29:07.695
Not that I know of.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.941
Did he force himself on you?

29:11.790 --> 29:12.609
I think so.

29:12.700 --> 29:15.328
You think so? But you're not sure.

29:16.630 --> 29:18.370
Did you tell him to stop?

29:19.710 --> 29:20.540
No.

29:21.090 --> 29:22.375
Did you tell him no?

29:25.220 --> 29:26.175
No.

29:26.970 --> 29:28.676
Maybe you consented,
then changed your mind.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.250
No, it's not like that!

29:31.970 --> 29:34.097
Should we involve your parents
or the police?

29:34.180 --> 29:35.010
No!

29:38.980 --> 29:40.356
Hannah, who's the boy?

29:42.860 --> 29:43.849
Who's the boy?

29:45.200 --> 29:46.406
I C/ay]
She cou/dn ’t give you a name.

29:46.490 --> 29:48.776
She didn't use the word,
but she described the rape.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.440
-Again, I can't--
-I know you can't.

29:50.620 --> 29:54.704
So let's talk about a hypothetical student
who says she was raped

29:54.830 --> 29:57.708
but won't say who did it, or can't.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.786
When a student is assaulted,

29:59.880 --> 30:01.745
I'm required to go to the police.

30:02.300 --> 30:05.758
But I need to know exactly
what happened and who did it.

30:09.680 --> 30:10.795
If I tell you...

30:11.810 --> 30:13.926
will you promise me that he'll go to jail?

30:15.270 --> 30:18.649
And_I won't ever have to see his face
again, that I won't have to face him?

30:18.770 --> 30:20.852
I can't promise you that, Hannah.

30:20.940 --> 30:22.896
But I will promise you this:

30:22.980 --> 30:26.814
I will do everything in my power
to keep you safe

30:27.110 --> 30:29.192
and protect you in this process.

30:30.160 --> 30:34.233
But I can't do that unless I know
everything that happened.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.405
Like a name.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.785
A name.

30:42.290 --> 30:43.416
Bryce Walker.

30:45.380 --> 30:47.211
Bryce Walker raped Hannah.

30:49.010 --> 30:51.001
If you can't give me a name...

30:52.010 --> 30:54.638
if you don't want to press charges
against this boy...

30:55.430 --> 30:57.887
if you're not even sure
you can press charges...

30:59.310 --> 31:02.359
then there really is only one option.

31:04.190 --> 31:05.270
[Hannah] What is it?

31:06.690 --> 31:08.851
I'm not trying to be blunt here,
Hannah, but...

31:09.450 --> 31:11.065
YOU can move on.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.486
You mean...

31:13.990 --> 31:15.230
do nothing.

31:16.370 --> 31:17.576
Is he in your class?

31:19.500 --> 31:20.489
He's a senior.

31:21.420 --> 31:23.706
That means he'll be gone in a few months.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.955
Are you fucking kidding me?

31:28.510 --> 31:32.332
It can be very dangerous
to accuse someone of a crime like that.

31:34.010 --> 31:35.591
I have his confession.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.425
How do you have his confession?

31:38.480 --> 31:39.674
I asked him for it.

31:40.890 --> 31:44.144
I took Hannah at her word,
which is what you should have done.

31:45.110 --> 31:47.772
I believed Hannah,
and I accused Bryce of rape,

31:47.940 --> 31:50.192
and then he beat the shit out of me
and admitted it.

31:50.280 --> 31:53.909
I think maybe now is where
we stop this conversation.

31:53.990 --> 31:55.821
-Okay. All right.
-Yeah.

31:57.740 --> 32:01.039
But wouldn't you like to know what
happened after Hannah left that day?

32:04.790 --> 32:06.838
Look, something happened, Hannah.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.165
And I believe you.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.370
But if you won't confront him...

32:12.380 --> 32:15.133
then the only other choice is to move on.

32:17.470 --> 32:18.300
[Hannah] Yeah.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.431
That's just what I'm going to have to do.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.067
Thank you, Mr. Porter.

32:27.150 --> 32:30.187
Okay. There's more to talk about,
other resources.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.100
No, I think we figured it out.

32:32.490 --> 32:34.230
I need to move on and get over it.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.060
Hannah, I didn't say get over it.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.230
But sometimes that's
the only other option.

32:38.370 --> 32:41.248
-Look, you're right. I know.
-[phone rings]

32:41.330 --> 32:44.037
Hey, Hannah, you can sit down.
You don't need to be in a hurry.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.917
I need to get on with things.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.491
If things aren't going to change,
I'd better get on with it.

32:48.590 --> 32:49.488
Hey, Hannah.

32:51.630 --> 32:53.370
[Clay]
She walked out of this office. . .

32:56.390 --> 32:58.210
and she hoped you would come after her.

32:59.180 --> 33:01.728
[Mr. Porter talks on phone]
Okay. I can have that for you...

33:01.850 --> 33:03.340
His door is closed behind me.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.146
Right. Yes, sir.

33:05.230 --> 33:07.687
{Clay}
But you didn’t.
-[Mr. Porter] Okay. Excellent.

33:07.770 --> 33:08.930
[hangs up phone]

33:13.860 --> 33:15.270
He's not coming.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.998
I think I've made myself very clear...

33:25.580 --> 33:27.707
but no one's coming forward to stop me.

33:29.250 --> 33:30.376
Some of you care.

33:32.550 --> 33:34.165
None of you cared enough.

33:36.720 --> 33:37.789
Neither did I.

33:39.680 --> 33:40.806
And I'm sorry.

33:48.310 --> 33:49.140
So...

33:51.570 --> 33:53.231
it's the end of tape 13.

33:55.610 --> 33:57.100
There's nothing more to say.

34:10.670 --> 34:12.626
[bell rings]

34:18.590 --> 34:21.252
[overlapping chatter]

34:32.820 --> 34:34.640
I C/ay]
You let her walk away.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.895
We all let her walk away.

34:40.740 --> 34:42.230
She walked out of school.. .

34:43.080 --> 34:44.069
went home. . .

34:45.290 --> 34:47.201
and put some things in order.

34:59.050 --> 35:02.599
She returned her uniform to
the Crestmont where I worked with her.

35:03.720 --> 35:04.675
She didn ’t say anything.

35:05.810 --> 35:08.552
She dropped it on the counter
and walked away.

35:10.980 --> 35:13.312
She dropped a package off with a friend

35:13.610 --> 35:15.430
then took another to the post oﬁ‘ice.

35:16.650 --> 35:17.480
Hannah.

35:18.240 --> 35:19.946
Oh. Hey. Robert.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.566
Hi. So good to see you.
We've missed you.

35:22.660 --> 35:24.366
-You have?
-At the group.

35:24.450 --> 35:26.281
Linda even wrote a poem about it.

35:26.370 --> 35:27.530
Oh, well, um...

35:27.620 --> 35:30.168
-I don't really write poetry anymore.
-That's too bad.

35:30.250 --> 35:32.536
Well, come visit sometime anyway, okay?

35:32.630 --> 35:34.586
-Yeah. Okay.
-Don't be a stranger.

35:36.090 --> 35:37.205
I C/ay]
Then she went back home. . .

35:38.670 --> 35:40.126
put on some old clothes.

35:43.050 --> 35:44.597
She went into the bathroom...

35:46.060 --> 35:47.459
filled the tub...

35:48.810 --> 35:50.550
opened the box of razor blades

35:50.640 --> 35:52.722
she took from her parents’store
that morning. . .

36:21.930 --> 36:23.170
She got into the tub...

36:24.470 --> 36:25.926
still with her clothes on...

36:27.260 --> 36:28.670
slit her wrists...

36:29.970 --> 36:31.301
and bled to death.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.990
[gasps, panting]

38:00.520 --> 38:01.509
And she died alone.

38:03.690 --> 38:04.816
[Mrs. Baker]
Hannah?

38:05.400 --> 38:09.564
Why is the water still running?
There's water all over the floor.

38:09.660 --> 38:11.480
Hannah, come on.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.246
Oh.

38:18.210 --> 38:19.416
Oh, no.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.086
No, no, no, no, no.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.217
No, no, no.
Come on, honey, it's okay.

38:25.300 --> 38:27.177
Come on, baby. Hannah?

38:27.340 --> 38:28.637
Oh, sweetheart.

38:29.430 --> 38:30.840
Come on. Come on, honey.

38:31.180 --> 38:32.169
It's okay. Andy!

38:32.310 --> 38:34.096
Come on, you're okay.
You're gonna be fine.

38:34.180 --> 38:35.886
Andy!

38:36.940 --> 38:39.226
Come on, honey,
it's okay, you're fine.

38:39.310 --> 38:41.517
Oh, God! Oh, Hannah! No, no!

38:41.610 --> 38:44.272
She's okay, she's okay.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.487
-Call 9-1-1. Call 9-1-1!
-Oh, God.

38:46.570 --> 38:49.562
Don't touch me, just call 9-1-1.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.945
Tell them to hurry!

38:52.080 --> 38:53.479
Tell them to hurry!

38:54.120 --> 38:55.747
And you could have stopped it.

38:56.830 --> 38:58.036
And I could have.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.320
Justin Foley could have.

39:01.420 --> 39:03.627
And a dozen other people, at least.

39:07.550 --> 39:08.756
But we didn't.

39:16.470 --> 39:17.471
[sighs]

39:19.190 --> 39:20.259
It's powerful.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.187
And painful.

39:27.150 --> 39:30.859
Just to imagine what Hannah's
last days were.

39:33.660 --> 39:36.868
To try to understand what led her there.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.781
But if she wanted to end her life...

39:42.670 --> 39:44.331
we weren't going to stop her.

39:46.880 --> 39:50.429
I cost a girl her life
because I was afraid to love her.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.426
You can't love someone back to life.

39:57.720 --> 39:58.721
You can try.

40:00.440 --> 40:01.475
Clay...

40:01.560 --> 40:05.564
we don't know what was in her mind
or in her heart.

40:05.650 --> 40:08.187
There's no way to know
why she did what she did.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.907
Actually, there is a way.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.036
[unzips bag]

40:35.050 --> 40:36.210
Before she died...

40:37.180 --> 40:40.172
Hannah recorded 13 reasons
why she killed herself.

40:43.190 --> 40:44.589
And you're number 13.

40:48.110 --> 40:51.147
And everyone who comes before you
on these tapes knows what you did

40:51.320 --> 40:52.696
and didn't do.

40:53.740 --> 40:54.900
And they always will.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.447
And they'll know what they did.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.787
You're the last person to get the tapes.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.168
Hannah didn't leave any instructions
on what happens after you...

41:09.500 --> 41:10.831
so you get to decide.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.586
And I added tape number 14...

41:17.970 --> 41:20.677
which I hope will help you
make that decision.

41:27.400 --> 41:28.890
How do you have these tapes?

41:32.940 --> 41:34.146
I'm number 11.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.006
It has to get better.

41:54.800 --> 41:57.086
The way we treat each other and...

41:57.390 --> 41:59.005
look out for each other.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.210
It has to get better somehow.

[exhales]

42:18.410 --> 42:19.445
[slow song playing]

42:19.570 --> 42:22.539
Sometimes when I think of your name

42:22.620 --> 42:25.282
When it’s only a game

42:26.040 --> 42:29.077
And I need you

42:29.580 --> 42:32.413
Listen to the words that you say

43:31.980 --> 43:34.107
I was wondering if you wanted to, like...

43:34.650 --> 43:36.026
hang out sometime?

43:38.570 --> 43:39.389
Okay.

43:42.280 --> 43:43.269
VVhen?

43:43.990 --> 43:44.900
How about now?

43:46.160 --> 43:49.789
How about we walk right out those doors
and hang out for a while?

43:51.420 --> 43:52.375
Are you okay?

43:55.380 --> 43:56.449
No.

43:58.510 --> 43:59.499
Is that all right?

44:01.050 --> 44:02.256
Yeah.

44:02.590 --> 44:03.500
That's fine.

44:13.060 --> 44:15.722
[woman] Tyler, honey, it's time to go.

44:16.940 --> 44:18.020
Tyler?

44:18.360 --> 44:19.179
[knocking at door]

44:19.280 --> 44:20.099
Are you in there?

44:20.190 --> 44:21.396
Just a second.

44:21.490 --> 44:23.196
Tyler, honey, it's time to go.

44:24.910 --> 44:25.729
Tyler.

44:26.240 --> 44:27.286
[knocks]

44:27.370 --> 44:28.189
Tyler.

44:35.210 --> 44:37.417
Mom. Privacy.

44:37.670 --> 44:39.706
I was calling for you.
We're gonna be late.

44:40.670 --> 44:42.171
Sorry. I was just grabbing a sweater.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.632
Your dad is on his way from work.

44:46.600 --> 44:49.171
Are you sure you don't want
Mr. Sebring to meet us there?

44:49.270 --> 44:51.477
Mom I didn't do anything wrong.
I don't need a lawyer.

44:51.560 --> 44:52.379
I just worry.

44:52.980 --> 44:54.720
Those kids are already picking on you.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.391
If you have to talk about them...

44:58.690 --> 45:01.602
Don't worry, Mom.
I can take care of myself.

45:05.320 --> 45:06.446
We should go.

45:06.620 --> 45:09.191
They said this afternoon's session
starts at two sharp.

45:09.290 --> 45:10.325
Andy, what's this?

45:12.460 --> 45:13.495
It's nothing.

45:13.710 --> 45:15.621
It's an application for Walplex.

45:16.380 --> 45:18.701
Their pharmacy's open till eleven.
I can do night shifts.

45:18.790 --> 45:20.337
No. Absolutely not.

45:20.420 --> 45:22.376
This case could go on
for a long time, Liv.

45:22.470 --> 45:23.289
Mrs. Baker.

45:27.090 --> 45:28.296
Tony, what...

45:30.060 --> 45:31.459
What are you... what is it?

45:34.020 --> 45:34.839
I, uh...

45:36.650 --> 45:39.141
I have to apologize
for not telling you everything.

45:41.570 --> 45:43.777
Hannah asked me to keep secrets for her.

45:45.570 --> 45:46.776
I wanted to honor that.

45:48.780 --> 45:51.658
But I've come to believe
I need to share something With you.

46:00.920 --> 46:02.660
There are 14 audio files on there.

46:03.510 --> 46:05.080
You should listen to them in order.

46:06.430 --> 46:09.968
I have the original tapes,
and for reasons you'll come to understand,

46:10.050 --> 46:11.677
I have them hidden somewhere very safe.

46:12.720 --> 46:15.177
But if you need those,
I will bring them to you too.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.140
What's on here? What kind of files?

46:22.360 --> 46:23.179
I...

46:24.690 --> 46:26.351
I really think you should just listen.

46:28.280 --> 46:29.861
What happened to Hannah...

46:30.700 --> 46:34.079
I wish that would never happen
to any other kid, ever.

46:34.660 --> 46:36.787
And if giving you this helps that, then...

46:43.000 --> 46:44.206
I'm sorry.

46:46.840 --> 46:48.580
I thought I was doing the right thing.

47:00.100 --> 47:01.351
We're going to be late.

47:04.860 --> 47:08.739
I would say that the climate
at Liberty High School...

47:10.280 --> 47:13.443
as I have experienced it myself, is bad.

47:15.040 --> 47:17.031
I get shit every... I'm sorry.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.282
It's fine, Tyler.
Just use your own words.

47:23.840 --> 47:25.410
I get shit every day.

47:26.590 --> 47:29.297
People trip me and slam me into walls.

47:30.430 --> 47:32.079
Lock me in the bathroom stalls

47:32.180 --> 47:33.386
and pull my pants down.

47:35.310 --> 47:38.427
And do you know if Hannah Baker
experienced bullying like this?

47:38.560 --> 47:41.302
Again, Dennis asks for an expert opinion.

47:42.100 --> 47:46.025
Did you ever hear anyone at Liberty
speak unkindly to Hannah?

47:47.740 --> 47:48.604
Yes.

47:49.150 --> 47:51.857
Can you tell me about the time
or times that happened?

47:53.820 --> 47:55.151
It happened all the time.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.320
Guys would...

47:59.120 --> 48:02.829
call her a slut and say that she's easy,

48:02.920 --> 48:04.785
that sort of stuff.

48:06.090 --> 48:09.878
Did you ever witness anyone
being physically abusive to Hannah?

48:09.970 --> 48:11.926
-I bet it happened.
-Dennis.

48:12.010 --> 48:14.501
Tyler, we have to ask you
not to speculate. Just...

48:15.260 --> 48:16.841
talk about what you actually witnessed.

48:18.470 --> 48:20.176
I saw how guys treated her.

48:20.560 --> 48:21.879
I have pictures of it.

48:22.560 --> 48:25.358
You have pictures of physical abuse?
You have proof?

48:26.770 --> 48:28.726
No, no, not physical abuse, but--

48:28.820 --> 48:32.392
Okay, let's, uh... talk about--

48:32.490 --> 48:33.309
There are tapes.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.190
I'm sorry?

48:38.240 --> 48:39.446
There are tapes.

48:40.450 --> 48:43.704
Hannah recorded tapes.
She talked about what happened to her.

48:45.420 --> 48:47.240
[Dennis] And where are these tapes now?

48:49.510 --> 48:52.047
Last I heard, Clay Jensen had them.

48:56.850 --> 48:58.306
Are you sure about that, Tyler?

48:59.930 --> 49:00.976
[Tyler] Last I heard.

49:03.560 --> 49:06.017
[Lainie] Well, Dennis,
without the tapes in evidence,

49:06.110 --> 49:07.475
I'd suggest we move on.

49:22.790 --> 49:23.779
[text alert]

49:42.560 --> 49:44.016

49:45.230 --> 49:46.185
[Alex]
Hello?

49:46.980 --> 49:49.392
[Dennis] Miss Davis,
it's important that you speak only

49:49.480 --> 49:51.528
to what you actually experienced.

49:51.780 --> 49:52.986
Okay?

49:53.400 --> 49:55.356
So, you and Hannah were friends?

49:56.360 --> 49:57.236
Yeah.

49:57.990 --> 49:59.116
For a while.

49:59.580 --> 50:00.945
What do you mean "for a while"?

50:01.870 --> 50:03.280
We stopped being friends.

50:04.410 --> 50:06.071
Can you tell me why you think
that happened?

50:07.960 --> 50:09.416
'Cause I slapped her.

50:10.340 --> 50:11.705
And why did you slap her?

50:12.800 --> 50:15.792
Because I thought she was
fooling around with my boyfriend.

50:17.130 --> 50:18.586
And why did you think that?

50:19.180 --> 50:20.090
Because...

50:28.150 --> 50:30.050
Because guys talk at our school.

50:31.070 --> 50:32.560
And they do sh--

50:33.150 --> 50:35.983
They do things to girls
that no one ever talks about

50:36.070 --> 50:38.197
and no one ever does anything about.

50:39.320 --> 50:40.947
Things like what, Miss Davis?

50:43.080 --> 50:44.695
Like what do you think?

50:44.870 --> 50:46.497
Be helpful if you could tell me.

50:48.170 --> 50:51.412
Miss Davis, I know this is difficult,
but it's important you tell us.

50:51.500 --> 50:53.331
-Argumentative.
-Hardly argumentative.

50:53.420 --> 50:54.296
Dennis.

50:57.590 --> 50:59.126
Don't force her to answer.

51:01.680 --> 51:02.715
Okay.

51:02.810 --> 51:03.708
Okay, Miss Davis.

51:05.430 --> 51:08.763
Uh, do you know anything about tapes
that Hannah recorded

51:08.850 --> 51:10.260
about what happened to her?

51:14.780 --> 51:15.815
No.

51:21.280 --> 51:22.907
When did you go to vodka?

51:24.580 --> 51:25.990
Since I needed to travel.

51:26.330 --> 51:29.663
Whoa, no, no, no.
You promised me a drink.

51:37.010 --> 51:38.750
They got you going to the lawyers today?

51:39.470 --> 51:40.505
I didn't go.

51:41.800 --> 51:43.927
Good. Good.

51:48.520 --> 51:49.930
How did Jensen know?

51:51.400 --> 51:52.435
About...

51:53.360 --> 51:54.509
me and Hannah Baker?

51:57.740 --> 52:00.311
Hannah Baker made these tapes
before she died.

52:02.070 --> 52:03.526
Saying what we all did to her.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.229
What you did.

52:06.870 --> 52:08.280
To Jessica.

52:08.830 --> 52:09.899
To Jessica?

52:11.290 --> 52:12.700
She was in the room that night.

52:14.000 --> 52:14.830
Hiding.

52:19.170 --> 52:20.580
You've heard these tapes?

52:22.220 --> 52:24.006
Yeah. I'm on 'em too.

52:26.350 --> 52:27.556
And who has them now?

52:28.520 --> 52:29.976
At this point, I don't know.

52:30.060 --> 52:30.879
Jesus.

52:34.270 --> 52:36.761
But who's gonna
believe a dead girl, right?

52:40.860 --> 52:42.020
I guess we'll find out.

52:44.070 --> 52:44.900
Justin.

52:46.660 --> 52:47.524
Justin.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.115
You know the real story, right?

52:52.410 --> 52:54.492
You know what's true.

52:57.290 --> 52:58.291
I do now.

53:00.260 --> 53:02.125
So I'll see you around?

53:04.090 --> 53:05.500
Nah, I don't think you will.
