00:02.003 --> 00:03.994
[man] Previously on Lost:

00:04.088 --> 00:05.828
- [Jack] Who are you?
- Daniel Faraday.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.299
I'm here to rescue you.

00:09.427 --> 00:12.169
| just almost died
jumping out of a helicopter

00:12.263 --> 00:14.845
- because you called us for help.
- She's lying.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.014
Whatever they came for, it isn't us.

00:17.101 --> 00:19.183
Hey. Is that from your chopper?

00:19.270 --> 00:22.808
Yeah. That, uh...
Yeah, they reduce the weight load.

00:22.899 --> 00:25.060
- What's this for?
- Uh...

00:25.151 --> 00:27.016
Rescuing you and your people...

00:27.111 --> 00:30.319
...I can't really say
it's our primary objective.

00:30.406 --> 00:32.146
Then what is?

00:36.954 --> 00:39.331
[clock ticking]

00:54.513 --> 00:56.799
Hello. I'm sorry I'm late.

00:56.891 --> 00:59.177
- You must be Dr. Burke.
- Juliet.

00:59.268 --> 01:02.135
Juliet. I'm Harper Stanhope.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.312
Please sit.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.186
Today is just a meet and greet

01:08.277 --> 01:10.438
so that we can get to know each other.

01:10.529 --> 01:14.522
Please don't take this the wrong way,
but I really don't think I need therapy.

01:16.118 --> 01:19.076
How about we call it "talking"
instead of therapy?

01:21.457 --> 01:22.913
- OK.
- Good.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.116
Let's talk.

01:25.878 --> 01:28.164
So you've been here a week...

01:29.006 --> 01:31.964
...and what's
your least favorite part so far?

01:32.802 --> 01:35.384
I don't like being treated
like a celebrity.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.462
And is that surprising?

01:37.556 --> 01:41.174
- You're big news right now.
- Yes, I know.

01:42.812 --> 01:45.599
I guess I don't like being
the center of attention.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.639
It makes me feel isolated.

01:50.528 --> 01:51.859
Alone.

01:54.824 --> 01:58.533
Well, maybe you feel
that all eyes are on you...

01:59.412 --> 02:01.619
...but you're not a celebrity.

02:01.706 --> 02:05.824
And soon enough you'll realize that
you're no different than anyone here.

02:05.918 --> 02:09.581
- I know. I never meant that l...
- Yes?

02:09.672 --> 02:11.913
Harper, I'm sorry for the interruption.

02:12.008 --> 02:15.967
I know you don't like me busting in,
but Ben would like to see the doc.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.754
She's all yours, Tom.

02:23.561 --> 02:26.143
It was nice talking to you, Juliet.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.266
Welcome to the island.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.313
Harper's a real piece of work.

02:33.404 --> 02:37.067
But if you give her a week, she'll
have you crying about your daddy.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.865
I'm speaking
from personal experience here.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.576
Welcome to your humble abode.

02:48.377 --> 02:49.753
This is for me?

02:50.546 --> 02:52.047
The whole house?

02:52.131 --> 02:55.840
You're here to help us with some
very important research, Juliet.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.008
We pulled out all the stops.

02:59.889 --> 03:02.221
Two bedrooms, two baths,
washer, dryer.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.967
- Fresh linens, a well-stocked fridge.
- [laughing]

03:06.062 --> 03:09.725
And I know you love the opera.
We have all the classics on CD.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.811
Ben, this is amazing.

03:12.902 --> 03:15.939
Seriously, you shouldn't have gone
to all the trouble.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.146
I'm only gonna be here for six months.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.776
Right, of course, but...

03:21.869 --> 03:23.860
...we want you to feel at home.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.998
Need some help?

03:34.090 --> 03:37.378
I'm fine. I just can't seem
to get it steady.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.129
[both grunting]

03:39.220 --> 03:40.801
OK.

03:41.639 --> 03:43.595
Nice. Thanks.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.684
Why are you going to all this trouble
when we're about to leave this island?

03:48.771 --> 03:51.012
We still need somewhere
to sleep tonight.

03:51.107 --> 03:54.315
Juliet, have you seen
Charlotte and Faraday?

03:54.402 --> 03:56.643
- All their stuff's gone.
- No, I haven't.

03:56.737 --> 04:00.980
- You have the sat-phone, right?
- [speaking Korean]

04:01.075 --> 04:03.407
He saw them going into the jungle.

04:06.122 --> 04:08.078
Why didn't he say anything?

04:08.165 --> 04:09.621
[speaking Korean]

04:11.836 --> 04:14.543
You said they are friends.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.215
Aren't they?

04:22.346 --> 04:25.804
We got a lot of ground to cover,
so let's fan out.

04:25.891 --> 04:29.634
If you cut their trail,
call out to me, I'll come to you.

04:39.822 --> 04:42.279
[thunder rumbling]

04:54.211 --> 04:57.544
[indistinct whispering]

05:00.718 --> 05:02.458
[whispering continues]

05:07.183 --> 05:09.048
Jack?

05:10.895 --> 05:12.977
Hello, Juliet.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.894
Long time, no see.

05:38.422 --> 05:39.832
What are you doing here?

05:39.924 --> 05:43.792
I came to deliver a message...
from Ben.

05:44.595 --> 05:48.053
The two people you're looking for,
Faraday and Lewis,

05:48.140 --> 05:50.005
they're headed to the Tempest.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.263
And if they figure out
how to deploy that gas...

05:54.230 --> 05:58.473
...then everyone on this island
is going to die.

06:00.945 --> 06:04.108
- Why don't you stop them?
- Because Ben wants you to go.

06:04.198 --> 06:07.656
How can Ben know where they are
when he's a prisoner?

06:07.743 --> 06:10.450
Ben is exactly where he wants to be.

06:18.212 --> 06:21.420
- How am I supposed to stop them?
- By pointing the gun

06:21.507 --> 06:24.044
and pulling the trigger.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.260
[Jack] Hey!

06:27.888 --> 06:30.004
Who are you?

06:31.308 --> 06:33.299
I'm an old friend of Juliet's.

06:35.020 --> 06:38.558
| just told her where the people
you're looking for are headed.

06:38.649 --> 06:41.106
Maybe you and your gun can go too.

06:42.945 --> 06:45.527
[indistinct whispering]

07:05.718 --> 07:08.300
[sobbing]

07:15.686 --> 07:17.176
[clattering]

07:25.529 --> 07:27.235
You OK?

07:28.907 --> 07:32.820
l was just looking for some gauze.
I didn't know anyone was here.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.995
How'd you manage that?

07:41.086 --> 07:44.624
l, um...
I work over at the power station.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.956
I pressed up against a transformer.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.089
Take a seat.
Let me take a look at it.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.553
You're Burke, right?

08:02.274 --> 08:03.605
The baby doctor.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.980
What gave me away?

08:10.658 --> 08:12.944
I heard we lost Henrietta this morning.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.160
It's OK. It's not your fault.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.659
Pregnant women
are dying on this island.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.920
l was brought here to help fix that.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.287
So whose fault is it?

08:28.175 --> 08:31.918
Believe me, no one expects you
to fix it overnight.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.433
You have anyone to talk to?
Any friends here?

08:42.606 --> 08:45.689
- Maybe Harper.
- Harper hates me.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.983
We only talk because we have to.

08:48.070 --> 08:52.439
| get the feeling that she's a mean
and spiteful person.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.443
She's my wife.

08:59.248 --> 09:00.658
- She's your wife?
- Mm-hmm.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.706
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't worry about it. It's OK.

09:06.797 --> 09:09.129
OK, you're... you're set.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.466
Much obliged, ma'am.

09:16.640 --> 09:20.303
Hey, I know this place can wear on you,

09:20.394 --> 09:22.225
but if you need to talk...

09:23.480 --> 09:25.141
...l'm around.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.438
Good to know.

09:27.401 --> 09:33.067
Oh, um, if you promise not to tell
your wife what I said about her...

09:33.949 --> 09:37.658
...I won't tell anyone you lied
about how you hurt your arm.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.742
I know a chemical burn when | see one.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.870
You got a deal.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.169
Uh, by the way...

09:58.140 --> 09:59.755
...l'm Goodwin.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.095
Juliet.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.446
Faraday and Charlotte
are heading for the Tempest.

10:15.532 --> 10:18.774
- The Tempest?
- lt's safer if I don't talk about it.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.450
No, talk about it, please.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.404
It's an electrical station
that powers the island.

10:23.499 --> 10:25.364
Why would they go there?

10:25.459 --> 10:27.165
Hey.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.286
If there's something
you need to tell me...

10:31.381 --> 10:33.121
...now's the time to do it.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.801
What I need is for you to help me.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.628
Will you help me?

10:46.730 --> 10:50.348
If we move all night,
maybe we can still catch them.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.393
Thank you.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.573
I think it's that way.

11:11.797 --> 11:14.539
What happens if I...

11:16.760 --> 11:18.591
What if I can't do it?

11:19.930 --> 11:21.420
Dan.

11:22.391 --> 11:23.847
Look at me.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.476
I know you can do this.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.186
We should get going.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.986
Yeah.

11:38.574 --> 11:39.814
Come on.

11:42.911 --> 11:46.369
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's OK. It's OK. lt's Kate.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.207
So they have Miles?

11:59.928 --> 12:03.216
Yeah, but he's fine.
They're treating him fine.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.423
I thought you two
were with Jack at the beach.

12:08.186 --> 12:10.142
What are you guys doing out here?

12:11.481 --> 12:14.723
Jack was trying to communicate
with Sayid and Desmond,

12:14.818 --> 12:17.685
but the sat-phone ran out ofjuice.

12:17.779 --> 12:21.271
It's totally dead.
There's no way we can call the boat.

12:22.075 --> 12:26.660
So we volunteered to get spare batteries
out the packs we threw out the chopper.

12:28.457 --> 12:32.416
So if you threw your pack
from the chopper,

12:32.502 --> 12:33.537
what's that?

12:35.505 --> 12:39.123
This, uh... I just borrowed this.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.047
Mind if I take a look?

12:46.516 --> 12:48.177
Go ahead, Dan, show her.

12:56.735 --> 12:57.850
Baï¬‚enes,huh?

12:57.945 --> 12:59.685
What's this...?
[grunts]

13:04.117 --> 13:05.323
What?

13:12.626 --> 13:15.208
- That woman, what was her name?
- Harper.

13:16.046 --> 13:19.288
- The two of you friends?
- Not exactly.

13:19.383 --> 13:22.796
- She was my therapist.
- You people had therapists?

13:22.886 --> 13:26.219
It's very stressful
being an Other, Jack.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.593
- Seemed hostile, even for a therapist.
- There are things from your past

13:32.688 --> 13:36.852
- you'd rather not talk about.
- Yeah. You read them all in my file.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.976
Trust me, Jack,
you don't want to see my file.

13:45.701 --> 13:48.943
The problem occurs somewhere
during the second trimester

13:49.037 --> 13:51.653
when the mother's immune system
is triggered.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.034
The white blood cell count plummets.

13:54.126 --> 13:58.085
It's like the immune system
turns on the fetus.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.420
- May I?
- Sure.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.678
- Any thought yet on a cause?
- It's really too early to tell,

14:11.768 --> 14:16.182
but only women who have conceived
on the island does it happen to which...

14:16.273 --> 14:18.059
Hey, Juliet.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.109
Ben, I didn't know you were here.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.861
Ethan's out sick.
I have an extra egg salad on rye.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.283
l was just checking if Juliet wants it.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.156
Thanks. I already ate.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.989
l have an appointment
with your wife in ten minutes.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.950
Great. Tell her I said hi.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.790
Oh, will do.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.506
- Ben?
- No, I'm fine.

14:59.566 --> 15:03.150
So, Juliet, what do you think of Ben?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.316
He's great.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.067
Very smart and intense.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.197
Challenging.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.742
- He's been really good to me.
- Of course he has.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.869
You look just like her.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.167
I'm sorry?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.870
| see you and my husband
have become friendly.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.719
Yeah. He's great.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.763
He's been really helpful.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.636
When did you start sleeping with him?

15:40.982 --> 15:42.688
What?

15:44.444 --> 15:48.107
Look, Juliet, I'm not an idiot,
so just tell me.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.154
When did it start?

15:52.035 --> 15:55.368
OK, I'm not doing this. We're done.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.413
No, please respect me enough
to spare me the pretense

15:58.500 --> 16:00.582
that you are actually offended.

16:00.669 --> 16:04.036
I know. I followed you.

16:07.008 --> 16:09.215
Watched you.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.301
- I'm sorry.
- It doesn't matter anymore.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.261
But what does matter

16:21.356 --> 16:24.564
is that you listen to me
and that you believe me.

16:27.571 --> 16:32.691
Now if you continue to have
a relationship with Goodwin...

16:33.827 --> 16:35.818
...there will be consequences.

16:37.747 --> 16:41.831
- I don't want him to get hurt.
- I would never hurt him.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.000
I am not talking about you.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.874
I am talking about Ben.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.505
Hi, John.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.306
Hey, Claire.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.019
Is there something I can do for you?

17:04.107 --> 17:06.348
I want to know
what's going on with Miles.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.190
Right now not a whole lot.

17:08.278 --> 17:12.612
I'm bringing him food and water
until he decides to talk.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.608
I'd like to talk to him myself.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.365
Why would you want to do that?

17:19.456 --> 17:22.038
John, we have to find out
who these people are

17:22.125 --> 17:26.209
and where they came from... and why
they're not interested in rescuing us.

17:26.296 --> 17:29.163
- You don't think I'll get that?
- No, l...

17:30.926 --> 17:33.884
| just think we might be
taking the wrong approach.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.212
I mean, you killed one,
Ben shot one.

17:37.307 --> 17:39.548
Now we're holding one prisoner.

17:39.643 --> 17:43.727
You know, it's not hard to understand
why they might think we're hostile.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.519
I might be just
a little less intimidating.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.940
- It's not going to happen, Claire.
- John.

17:53.031 --> 17:55.898
You do remember what Charlie said
about these people.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.825
All Charlie said
was whose boat it isn't.

18:00.288 --> 18:03.655
Don't you want to know whose boat it is?

18:12.550 --> 18:13.710
[keys clattering]

18:24.521 --> 18:28.013
- Rabbit today?
- We're running out of chickens.

18:31.319 --> 18:34.277
This didn't have a number on it, did it?

18:34.364 --> 18:36.355
What?

18:36.491 --> 18:39.358
Eat, change. Put your laundry
and dishes by the door.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.829
I'll be back to collect them
in 15 minutes.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.495
So has the revolution begun yet?

18:50.422 --> 18:52.128
What are you talking about?

18:53.591 --> 18:56.833
Well, you're the leader now.
I know it's a tough position.

18:57.512 --> 19:01.130
You have to deal with all those people
second-guessing decisions.

19:01.224 --> 19:04.011
It starts out so innocently, doesn't it?

19:04.102 --> 19:08.266
A question here, a comment there.
And then if you're not careful,

19:08.356 --> 19:11.723
you find you have a full-blown
insurrection on your hands.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.857
Believe me, your people
are gonna be so angry

19:15.947 --> 19:19.235
when they realize
you still don't have a plan.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.445
And I assume you have a plan.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.404
| always have a plan.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.832
Does it involve
you raising $3.2 million?

19:33.131 --> 19:34.917
That's a lot of money.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.381
Wait.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.878
Maybe this will get you started.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.674
Put your laundry and dishes
by the door.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.762
I can help you, John.
We have shared interests.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.313
- Or at least a common enemy.
- Our friends on the freighter.

19:55.403 --> 19:59.112
Not them. The one they work for.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.779
Let me out of here.

20:04.412 --> 20:07.449
Give me some semblance of freedom.
Let me sleep in a bed,

20:07.540 --> 20:09.747
eat with utensils,
and I give you my word

20:09.834 --> 20:12.997
- I'll tell you everything...
- See, there's the problem.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.874
I don't trust your word.

20:16.591 --> 20:17.876
All right, then.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.798
I guess I'll have to show you.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.867
I hope this is good.

20:45.954 --> 20:49.071
I don't know much about wine.
| swiped this off the sub.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.420
There.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.122
Thanks.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.845
| wish we could do this all the time.

21:11.479 --> 21:15.267
I hate that we have to be so... private.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.767
What's the matter with being private?

21:18.862 --> 21:23.105
It's ridiculous. I've been sleeping
on the couch for a year.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.360
Why am | notjust telling her?

21:26.870 --> 21:29.156
I don't think it's a good idea.

21:36.546 --> 21:37.581
Why not?

21:40.049 --> 21:41.630
Ben wouldn't like it.

21:41.718 --> 21:44.676
That's what this is about?
You're worried about Ben?

21:46.639 --> 21:48.721
Why, because he has a crush on you?

21:50.727 --> 21:53.013
- You know?
- Come on, everyone knows.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.220
He follows you around like a puppy.

21:56.608 --> 21:59.020
And you don't think that's a problem?

21:59.569 --> 22:03.812
A little less than a kilometer from here
he has me working with chemicals

22:03.907 --> 22:08.116
that could kill every man, woman
and child if I flipped the wrong switch.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.619
Trust me, Ben has enough on his plate.

22:11.706 --> 22:14.038
The last thing he cares about
is you and me.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.620
| just...

22:16.711 --> 22:19.123
...get the feeling
that he would be upset.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.247
What's Ben gonna do?

22:34.938 --> 22:36.849
Goodwin!

22:38.650 --> 22:41.642
- You see where the tail landed?
- Probably in the water.

22:41.736 --> 22:45.399
You can make that shore in an hour.
Ethan, get up to that fuselage.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.526
There may actually be survivors.

22:47.617 --> 22:50.700
And you're one of 'em.
A passenger. You're in shock.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.904
Come up with a story if they ask.
Stay quiet if they don't.

22:53.998 --> 22:58.617
Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.
I want lists in three days. Go.

23:17.897 --> 23:21.355
Something's wrong. We should've
caught up with them by now.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.979
These people base-jumped
out of a helicopter.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.277
Let's give them
the benefit of the doubt.

23:26.364 --> 23:28.150
[groaning]

23:31.327 --> 23:33.704
Hey. Hey.

23:33.788 --> 23:35.824
It's OK. Hey. It's all right.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.121
It's OK.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.744
Hey.

23:40.461 --> 23:43.123
It's OK. You're all right. Come on.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.921
Take it easy.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.374
Take it easy.

23:50.430 --> 23:53.638
- I'll go get her some water.
- Yeah. Thanks.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.015
What happened?

24:02.150 --> 24:04.607
l was going back to the beach and...

24:05.361 --> 24:09.320
I ran into Faraday
and that woman, um, Charlotte.

24:09.407 --> 24:10.863
I think she hit me.

24:10.950 --> 24:14.238
They disappeared out of camp
last night. Trying to catch up.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.281
Do you know where they were headed?

24:19.375 --> 24:23.084
Some sort of... power station.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.203
Jack.

24:26.424 --> 24:28.380
They had gas masks.

24:33.181 --> 24:34.512
Juliet.

24:36.434 --> 24:37.970
Juliet!

24:45.526 --> 24:47.027
Juliet!

24:50.365 --> 24:51.775
Juliet!

25:00.291 --> 25:02.407
All right, no tricks.

25:03.753 --> 25:07.291
You're not leading me out
into the jungle so you can disappear

25:07.382 --> 25:09.998
or shoot me in the back.

25:10.093 --> 25:11.458
No tricks, John.

25:11.552 --> 25:14.089
We don't even have to leave
the living room.

25:15.932 --> 25:17.513
So let's have it.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.386
We have a deal, right?

25:21.604 --> 25:25.563
How do I know you won't run off and
meet your people first chance you get?

25:25.650 --> 25:30.360
If my people still wanted me they'd
have stormed this camp long ago.

25:34.409 --> 25:36.616
lt's behind that picture.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.131
Thirty-six, 15, 28.

26:17.285 --> 26:18.775
"Red Sox"?

26:19.245 --> 26:21.361
l taped over the game.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.496
[machine whirring]

26:49.358 --> 26:50.973
This is Charles Widmore.

26:53.654 --> 26:56.691
This is the man whose boat
is parked offshore.

26:59.952 --> 27:03.536
This is the man that's been trying
to find the island.

27:10.338 --> 27:12.078
Who's the man in the blindfold?

27:12.173 --> 27:15.415
One of my people that had
the misfortune to get caught.

27:15.510 --> 27:18.968
- How does Widmore know of the island?
- I don't know, but he does.

27:19.055 --> 27:21.637
What does he want?

27:21.724 --> 27:24.386
John, three months ago
in Gainesville, Florida,

27:24.477 --> 27:27.264
the Virgin Mary seemed to appear
in a patch of mold

27:27.355 --> 27:29.812
on the side of an old housing complex.

27:29.899 --> 27:34.609
When word got out, over 5,000 people
came to see her face for themselves.

27:34.695 --> 27:37.903
You've survived an airline crash
on this island.

27:37.990 --> 27:42.154
One minute you're in a wheelchair,
the next doing jumping jacks.

27:42.245 --> 27:44.657
lf 5,000 people came out
to see a piece of mold,

27:44.747 --> 27:48.239
how many people do you think
would come out to see you?

27:52.129 --> 27:54.541
Charles Widmore
wants to exploit this island.

27:54.632 --> 27:57.123
He'll do everything in his power
to possess it.

28:14.569 --> 28:18.357
Everything I know about Charles Widmore
is contained in this file.

28:18.447 --> 28:22.360
Some of it's vague, some of it's
guesswork, some of it's concrete,

28:22.451 --> 28:25.284
but this is everything,
and now it's all yours.

28:29.917 --> 28:32.499
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you all this sooner...

28:34.922 --> 28:37.664
...but it was the only
bargaining chip I had left.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.468
There's one more thing I need to know.

28:44.557 --> 28:48.846
Your man on the boat,
I want you to tell me who it is.

28:51.856 --> 28:53.562
All right.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.899
But you might want to sit down.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.033
She came through here.

29:07.830 --> 29:10.287
So did they, about
half an hour ahead of her.

29:12.919 --> 29:15.035
- What happened?
- Sorry?

29:15.129 --> 29:17.040
At Locke's. Why did you stay?

29:18.966 --> 29:22.003
I stayed because I had
to find something out.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.425
Are you gonna tell me

29:23.512 --> 29:27.425
or are we gonna keep walking through
the jungle like it doesn't matter?

29:34.857 --> 29:38.395
I stayed to find out if the people
on the freighter know who I am.

29:38.486 --> 29:41.068
If they knew that I'm a fugitive...

29:41.155 --> 29:43.146
...that I'm wanted for murder.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.656
Do they?

29:47.620 --> 29:49.531
Yeah, they know.

29:52.083 --> 29:53.789
We should keep moving.

29:53.876 --> 29:55.867
God knows where Juliet is.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.147
[squeaking]

30:22.530 --> 30:23.940
[door banging]

30:34.041 --> 30:35.952
Hi, come on in.

30:37.169 --> 30:40.627
Sorry, have to get this ham
out of the oven, or it'll dry out.

30:40.715 --> 30:42.546
Please, don't mind me.

30:42.633 --> 30:45.591
- How are you feeling, by the way?
- Never better.

30:48.389 --> 30:49.925
Smells delicious.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.969
Ben, I thought this was a dinner party.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.303
Just you and me.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.853
I guess I should've made that clearer.

31:04.113 --> 31:07.276
No, it's fine.
I hope you like dinner rolls.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.357
ldoindeed.

31:09.452 --> 31:12.034
[opera playing]

31:14.290 --> 31:18.033
I want to thank you for how wonderful
you've been with Zach and Emma.

31:18.127 --> 31:20.459
They're really sweet kids.

31:22.882 --> 31:27.967
Ben, they've been asking me
about their mother in Los Angeles.

31:28.054 --> 31:31.467
- I'm not really sure what to say.
- They'll stop asking in time.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.264
They're children.

31:34.351 --> 31:35.966
Do they really belong here?

31:36.854 --> 31:38.560
They're on the list, Juliet.

31:38.647 --> 31:41.980
Who are we to question
who's on the list and who's not?

31:43.986 --> 31:48.229
Now that we have everyone on the list
for the tail section what about Goodwin?

31:50.618 --> 31:52.904
He's been undercover for three weeks.

31:57.124 --> 31:59.661
He's making a case
for this woman, Ana Lucia.

32:01.170 --> 32:04.128
He thinks she'd be
a valuable member of our society.

32:04.215 --> 32:06.501
But between you and me,
I don't see it.

32:06.592 --> 32:09.755
He feels very passionately about her.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.507
Almost inappropriately so.

32:13.557 --> 32:15.422
After losing Ethan, it's a risk.

32:15.518 --> 32:18.385
Goodwin stays where he's at
right now, Juliet.

32:18.479 --> 32:22.597
There's no reason for him
to hurry back, right?

32:22.691 --> 32:26.354
But his assignment will be over soon.
I promise you.

No, no. I'm not trying to release it.
I'm trying to render it inert.

...look me in the eye
and tell me you are certain

34:55.761 --> 34:59.595
Benjamin Linus wouldn't use this gas
to kill everyone on this island!

34:59.682 --> 35:01.923
We know he's used it before.

35:02.017 --> 35:04.429
If you wanna stop us,
you have to shoot us both.

36:24.475 --> 36:27.433
He has extensive experience
in tumor removal.

36:30.939 --> 36:33.021
- How about that?
- He can help you.

36:39.948 --> 36:43.691
I thought you'd be more excited.
What's wrong?

36:47.539 --> 36:49.530
I need you to come with me.

36:55.798 --> 37:00.462
After our last raid on the tail-section
survivors, they ran off, left the beach.

37:02.054 --> 37:06.297
I sent Pickett and Tom to track
their location. They came across this.

37:07.267 --> 37:09.053
I'm sorry, Juliet.

37:09.144 --> 37:11.135
Sorry about what?

37:13.982 --> 37:15.893
Oh, my God.

37:16.527 --> 37:18.313
Oh, my God.

37:18.404 --> 37:21.111
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

37:22.783 --> 37:23.989
Oh, my God!

37:27.079 --> 37:29.195
Goodwin.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.280
[sobbing]

37:31.375 --> 37:32.706
What happened?

37:33.836 --> 37:36.748
We don't know.
There weren't any witnesses.

37:36.839 --> 37:40.047
I can only assume they found out
he wasn't one of them.

37:41.969 --> 37:45.837
- Guess I should've listened to you.
- Why are you showing me this?

37:49.852 --> 37:52.264
Why did you bring me out here?

37:52.813 --> 37:55.350
What, you mean instead of his wife?

38:01.572 --> 38:03.779
You knew this would happen.

38:06.952 --> 38:10.410
You sent him out here because
you knew this would happen.

38:11.081 --> 38:14.869
You wanted this.
You wanted him to die!

38:16.962 --> 38:18.077
VVhy?

38:19.089 --> 38:21.171
VVhy?

38:22.759 --> 38:24.966
You're asking me why?

38:25.762 --> 38:30.222
After everything I did to get you here,
everything I've done to keep you here,

38:30.309 --> 38:32.766
how can you possibly not understand...

38:34.771 --> 38:36.762
...that you're mine?

38:44.740 --> 38:46.446
Take as much time as you need.

38:53.499 --> 38:55.490
[sobbing]

39:00.631 --> 39:02.747
[electrical zapping]

39:11.350 --> 39:14.092
Whoa! Kate, it's all right.
They're on our side.

39:14.186 --> 39:17.849
"Our side," Juliet?
She just knocked me unconscious.

39:17.940 --> 39:21.478
Yeah. I'm very sorry about that,
but I had no choice!

39:24.154 --> 39:27.112
Look, Daniel's inside
securing the facility.

39:27.199 --> 39:30.111
If you come with me,
I'll be more than happy to explain

39:30.202 --> 39:32.443
exactly how we just saved your life!

39:36.416 --> 39:38.372
All right, let's go.

39:42.172 --> 39:44.163
I'll take their word for it.

39:52.975 --> 39:54.636
You OK?

39:59.273 --> 40:01.229
He wanted me to kill them.

40:04.319 --> 40:06.605
Ben. He told me to kill both of them.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.402
- How can he tell you anything?
- I don't know.

40:15.497 --> 40:19.786
But he knew how to get to me, knew where
they were going, what they were doing.

40:19.876 --> 40:21.707
Don't you understand?

40:21.795 --> 40:25.083
These people came here
to wage war against Ben.

40:26.174 --> 40:28.085
And Ben's gonna win, Jack.

40:29.595 --> 40:32.678
And when he does, you don't
want to be anywhere near me.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.680
Why not?

40:39.229 --> 40:41.345
Because he thinks that I'm his.

40:44.192 --> 40:46.729
And he knows how I feel about you.

41:10.093 --> 41:12.300
He knows where to find me.

41:31.907 --> 41:33.317
Oh!

41:34.242 --> 41:35.652
Beat that.

41:44.586 --> 41:47.293
- [laughing]
- Son of a bitch!

41:49.132 --> 41:51.418
How'd you get so damn good
at horseshoes?

41:51.551 --> 41:53.758
I don't know. Guess I'm just lucky.

42:01.603 --> 42:03.810
What the hell are you doing out?

42:04.773 --> 42:06.104
See you guys at dinner.
