What About Brian:

00:01.959 --> 00:05.375
My chances of getting pregnant
are about five percent.

00:05.375 --> 00:09.417
The first thing I would
recommend is ovulation
stimulation.

00:09.417 --> 00:13.166
- Are there any side effects?
- Gobs. Hot flashes,
mood swings.

00:13.166 --> 00:17.208
If this is the way it has to be,
I don't want to have a baby at
all.

Deena, a bunch of us are meeting
at the beach playground.

00:22.834 --> 00:24.208

- Yeah.

00:24.208 --> 00:26.583
We got married so young,
you know?

00:26.583 --> 00:30.125
We missed out on the excitement
a lot of other people had.

00:30.125 --> 00:32.917
What if we had sex
with other people?

00:32.917 --> 00:35.500

- Dave.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.166

Where are you? Call me.

01:26.625 --> 01:28.458
J.C.?

01:28.458 --> 01:31.792
John Cougar. Adam's been calling
me that since grade school.

01:31.792 --> 01:36.375

in a pink house?
- I had bad hair. Bangs. Mullet.

Better.

especially when you...

01:48.709 --> 01:51.792

- That was good. I liked that.

01:51.792 --> 01:56.500

her to sit. Why? Because it's

He calls on Saturdays.

No, I haven't heard from the guy
all week. It's kind of weird.

06:12.542 --> 06:16.959
Not that he'd wanna tag along
today, anyway. We're doing
wedding stuff.

I thought we'd go
to the King Tut exhibit.

Really? You wouldn't
wanna miss that.

you can make one little step
forward.

Just a tiny one. I will meet
with wedding planners. I will
look at venues.

possibly about what I said
the other night.

07:34.917 --> 07:37.125

I haven't heard from you

hasn't heard from you.

12:40.041 --> 12:42.750
Maybe you could just drop her
off and I'll watch her.

12:43.959 --> 12:46.875
I barely get enough time
to see her as it is.

12:50.542 --> 12:52.875
Maybe we just won't come.

12:54.959 --> 12:58.125
I'm sorry, Richard.
I really am.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.125
[muffled scream]

13:09.125 --> 13:11.917
[shouting in Italian]

13:18.917 --> 13:20.542
- [vacuum hums]
- Where's Brian?

13:20.542 --> 13:23.542
I don't know.
He did not show up.

13:23.542 --> 13:26.417
Honey,
the housekeeper came yesterday.

13:26.417 --> 13:28.750
We need a new housekeeper.

13:30.625 --> 13:33.709
You never vacuum in your life.
What is it with your moods?

13:33.709 --> 13:37.083
- What moods?
- I have never
seen you like this.

13:37.083 --> 13:40.792
- You're taking on
too much at work.
- I'm not taking on too much.

13:40.792 --> 13:43.291
- It's just, honey, honey...
- What?

13:43.291 --> 13:47.709
- I wanted to tell you...
- Is it that time of the month?

13:47.709 --> 13:50.792
Yes. Yes, that's it.
It's that time of the month.

13:50.792 --> 13:54.458
I understand that. But these
games are very important to me.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.583
It is a piece of my home
that I can bring into our home.

13:57.583 --> 14:00.583
And can you please
clean up later?

14:00.583 --> 14:02.542
- OK.
- OK? Thank you.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.417
OK. OK.

14:04.417 --> 14:05.625
OK.

14:07.291 --> 14:09.875
Can you... Can you just...

14:09.875 --> 14:13.709
It's just that this place
is disgusting! It's filthy!
Look at it!

14:15.709 --> 14:17.917
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

14:17.917 --> 14:20.959
Nicole, Nicole.

14:20.959 --> 14:23.542
You know what? I'll watch
the game somewhere else.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.875
So, where's this from?

14:29.875 --> 14:34.125
My dad's third wife
was a ski instructor in Tahoe.

14:34.125 --> 14:38.000
- Your dad was married
three times?
- Yeah, uh, sort of.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.375
You know, four times.

14:40.375 --> 14:43.166
Wow. That must
have been rough.

14:43.166 --> 14:46.583
Um, how old were you
when your parents split up?

14:46.583 --> 14:49.500
Young. Grade school.

14:49.500 --> 14:54.667
Um... Anyway, let's try
something with better karma.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.083
OK.

14:56.083 --> 14:59.417
We build from the plate up.
There's the Banded, the Classic.

14:59.417 --> 15:03.750
I prefer the Lenox
over the Royal Crown Derby.

15:03.750 --> 15:07.875
Then we have Contemporary. I
love love the Jean-Louis Coquet.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.834
Or there's the Havilland,
as in Olivia de.

15:10.834 --> 15:14.250
Finally, Whites &amp; Ivories. Did
you know there's a difference?

15:14.250 --> 15:16.792
- What do you think?
- I don't care.

15:16.792 --> 15:21.875
- OK. The Lenox.
- Not the Lenox.

15:21.875 --> 15:26.625
- OK. That one.
- The Derby. Decent.

15:26.625 --> 15:30.417
With the twelve-piece set comes
a choice: soup tureen or sushi
tray?

15:30.417 --> 15:32.333
- Sushi.
- Soup.

15:32.333 --> 15:35.250
- I thought you didn't care.
- You don't even make soup.

15:35.250 --> 15:38.375
- I might learn to make soup.
- You might learn to make sushi.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.667
OK, you know what?
Knock yourself out.

15:40.667 --> 15:43.917
I'm going
to the ladies room.

15:43.917 --> 15:48.250
Look, I don't care.
I really don't care.

15:48.250 --> 15:53.208
So just go print out any John
Doe registry and we'll take
what they took.

15:53.208 --> 15:55.834
Sound good?

15:55.834 --> 15:59.166
You're gonna need to learn
to pace yourself.

16:02.959 --> 16:05.709
Brian. S.O.S.
I'm at the mall, registering.

16:05.709 --> 16:08.375
I am going to die.
You have to get me out of here.

16:08.375 --> 16:11.417
Are you still at Angelo's?
I'll watch soccer over this.

16:11.417 --> 16:13.667
Just call Marjorie now.
Make an excuse.

16:13.667 --> 16:16.542
You need me to hang shelves,
wash the dog, anything.

16:16.542 --> 16:20.959
Brian, hey, it's me. So, listen,
we shouldn't do this over the
phone.

16:20.959 --> 16:24.250
We should have lunch
or coffee.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.875
It's kind of important, not
to sound all psychobabbleish.

16:27.875 --> 16:32.583
But things have been awkward.
I feel awkward, you feel
awkward, it's awkward.

16:32.583 --> 16:36.875
Say that word three times fast,
right? OK. Gotta go.

16:39.667 --> 16:43.000
Sorry.
You looked hot in that shirt.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.166
Well, you have
really strong legs.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.458
It was the wall.
Leverage is everything.

16:50.458 --> 16:53.792
Yeah. OK, do you have anything
to eat in this apartment?

16:53.792 --> 16:56.083
- Yeah.
- OK.

16:56.083 --> 17:00.709
- Nice and easy. There you go.
- Come on. Play, play.

17:00.709 --> 17:03.667
OK. Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up.
Keep 'em up in the air.

17:03.667 --> 17:06.333
- That's right.
- Stop playing on your computer.

17:06.333 --> 17:09.000
Quiet,
'cause Larissa's sleeping.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.875
I love this game.

17:12.333 --> 17:16.000
Oh, my God. OK.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.834
What is that?

17:18.834 --> 17:21.000
- The lights went out.
- Hold on a second.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.125
Stay in here
and count the balloons.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.542
[man shouting in Spanish]

17:28.041 --> 17:30.417
- What happened?
- You blew a fuse.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.125
- I blew a fuse?
- We tied into
your house for power.

17:33.125 --> 17:36.542
You had all the lights on.
Where's your fuse box?
I'll take care of it.

17:36.542 --> 17:38.000
I don't know.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.500
What kind of a grown man doesn't
know where his fuse box is at?

17:41.500 --> 17:44.625
- Look who decided to show up.
- What's going on?

17:44.625 --> 17:47.375
- Where's Little Mermaid?
- Deena, don't.

17:47.375 --> 17:50.166
- Well, what is it?
- It's a sea horse.

17:50.166 --> 17:52.041
- A sea horse?
- That's what it is.

17:52.041 --> 17:54.709
OK, look, you left me stranded
all morning long,

17:54.709 --> 17:57.041
and the bouncy guys
just blew out the power.

17:57.041 --> 17:59.750
- The power's out?
- Ma'am, I can take care of it.

17:59.750 --> 18:03.166
- Where's your fuse box?
- It's around the side
of the house.

18:05.458 --> 18:08.291
- Did you take out my cupcakes?
- What?

18:09.417 --> 18:12.083
No, no, no.
Please, please, no.

18:14.959 --> 18:18.333
What did you do
to my cupcakes?

18:18.333 --> 18:20.000
I thought
you said 45 minutes.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.208
25 minutes

18:23.208 --> 18:26.250
for the cupcakes.

18:26.250 --> 18:30.375
This one's still good, if you
just put the clown face on,
like you were saying.

18:30.375 --> 18:33.166
If you put
a really big nose...

18:35.250 --> 18:38.083
- Go.
- OK.

18:47.291 --> 18:50.000
[chuckling]
Oh, you did have awful hair.

18:51.375 --> 18:54.500
OK, so that's Adam
with the braces.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.000
Magnet Mouth.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
- [gasps] Is that
your prom date?
- Patti Ross.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.291
She lives in a commune
in Oregon now. Saw that coming.

19:05.375 --> 19:07.041
Did you have sex
prom night?

19:09.583 --> 19:11.583
- I said I did.
- Oh.

19:13.834 --> 19:17.667
Are you one of those guys that's
had sex with, like, a million
girls?

19:17.667 --> 19:20.709
Me? No. No way.

19:20.709 --> 19:24.917
You totally are.
How many? I'll tell you.

19:24.917 --> 19:27.166
- Don't tell me.
- 13.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.208
Come on. I wanna know.

19:30.208 --> 19:32.333
- You wanna know?
- Yeah.

19:33.917 --> 19:37.583
- You were my first.
- Oh, come on. Fess up.

19:39.875 --> 19:41.875
- You done with that?
- Yeah.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.333
[phone ringing]

19:43.333 --> 19:46.834
Anyway, you wanna watch a movie,
play a board game or something?

19:46.834 --> 19:48.959
[♪♪]

19:52.417 --> 19:55.875
Brian. It's me, again.

19:55.875 --> 19:59.041
Here's the thing.
I just want you to be happy.

19:59.041 --> 20:03.083
Really, I do.
I am always rooting for you.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.166
"Yay, Brian," that's me.

20:05.166 --> 20:08.166
And for you to think anything
else is absurd, so call me.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.583
Call me, Brian.

20:11.417 --> 20:13.083
[beeps]

20:18.333 --> 20:20.333
Scandalous.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.917
What's scandalous?

20:22.917 --> 20:26.959
That I lost an hour's worth
of work this morning when
the power went off.

20:26.959 --> 20:31.041
I thought it was the thousand
things you've been ignoring
that need doing,

20:31.041 --> 20:33.083
like the way
you ignored my cupcakes.

20:33.083 --> 20:35.583
- Yeah, I'm working, Deena.
- On what, Dave?

20:35.583 --> 20:38.417
50 people will be arriving.
There are no gift bags.

20:38.417 --> 20:41.250
- What is so crucial?
- Leviathan notes.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.834
Then we'll call Brian
and we'll have him do it.

20:43.834 --> 20:47.208
We can't call Brian. If I don't
do my job, nothing happens.

20:47.208 --> 20:50.458
There's no house, no party,
no little gift bags,

20:50.458 --> 20:53.333
and no internationally acclaimed
clown cupcakes.

20:53.333 --> 20:57.041
- Larissa loves my cupcakes.
- Larissa's five.
You love the cupcakes.

20:57.041 --> 20:59.333
They consume you.
Rome was easier to build.

20:59.333 --> 21:03.333
Here's a tip: Ralphs, 3.99 a
dozen. You know what? They taste
the same.

21:03.333 --> 21:06.125
They do not taste the same,
Dave. Take it back.

21:06.125 --> 21:07.834
- No.
- Take it back.

21:07.834 --> 21:11.125
- I'm not taking it back.
- Where are you going?

21:11.125 --> 21:13.291
I'm going
to pick up a Barney costume

21:13.291 --> 21:17.458
because my ex-friend Brian
has fallen off the face
of the Earth.

21:28.333 --> 21:31.000
[shouting in Italian]

21:34.250 --> 21:36.667
- He's good. He's very good.
- Honey, honey.

21:36.667 --> 21:39.625
- Honey, hi.
- Amore.
What are you doing here?

21:39.625 --> 21:42.000
- I just wanted
to surprise you, OK?
- OK.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.458
If this is important to you,
it's important to me. I wanna
be part of it.

21:46.458 --> 21:49.291
Honey,
what do you want to drink?

21:49.291 --> 21:51.458
A Chardonnay.
I'll have a Chardonnay.

21:51.458 --> 21:53.667
- You got it, hon.
- Yeah, Chardonnay.

21:53.667 --> 21:56.709
- What are you looking at?
- It's OK. It's my wife.

21:56.709 --> 21:59.041
Amore, amore,
watch the game.

22:00.750 --> 22:04.500
What, what, what, what? It's not
exciting. I mean, this game.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.375
What's the score?
Honey, what's the score?

22:07.375 --> 22:10.458
- Zero to zero.
- See? Snooze fest.

22:10.458 --> 22:13.834
This is why it hasn't
caught on in America.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.959
- It's just boring.
- It's not boring.

22:15.959 --> 22:19.417
It's just a soccer game.
I mean, can you just watch it?

22:19.417 --> 22:21.333
I mean...

22:21.333 --> 22:23.208
Wait, wait, wait.
My glasses.

22:23.208 --> 22:25.583
- My glasses.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:25.583 --> 22:28.458
Help me find my glasses.
Did you see my sunglasses?

22:28.458 --> 22:31.750
Will somebody...
Has anybody seen my sunglasses?

22:42.291 --> 22:46.875
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I pay
the drink for everybody. OK?

22:46.875 --> 22:49.125
[Lisa giggles]

22:49.125 --> 22:51.875
This... this is the way
to spend a Saturday.

22:53.709 --> 22:55.834
Wanna brush your teeth?

22:55.834 --> 22:57.417
- Really?
- Sure. Why not?

22:57.417 --> 22:59.750
Some people
are freaks about that stuff.

22:59.750 --> 23:02.375
Where would this toothbrush go
that I haven't?

23:03.959 --> 23:06.375
Well, germs.
Could be a world killer.

23:06.375 --> 23:10.792
Not our world. Take a sip off my
beer, a hit off my Tootsie Pop,
whatever.

23:12.291 --> 23:15.667
Your germs are my germs,
or vice versa.

23:26.250 --> 23:30.750
OK, did you spend ten years
in prison or something?

23:30.750 --> 23:33.333
- Where did that come from?
- I just don't get it.

23:33.333 --> 23:36.375
- How is a guy
like you still single?
- Um...

23:36.375 --> 23:38.500
I'm just curious.
Do you mind my asking?

23:38.500 --> 23:41.417
- No. I mean, I just...
- You know, I get it.

23:41.417 --> 23:46.041
You were probably in one of
those really long, long,
long-term relationships.

23:47.417 --> 23:50.500
- No.
- Did you get crushed
or something?

23:50.500 --> 23:53.792
I did once. Took me like
two years to walk upright.

23:53.792 --> 23:57.000
- Nope.
- So, what?

23:57.000 --> 24:00.875
- Was there one that got away?
- Not really. Um...

24:00.875 --> 24:05.291
Anyway, let's put some
toothpaste on that brush.

24:07.125 --> 24:10.542
Did anyone tell you
that you do this funny thing?

24:10.542 --> 24:12.041
What thing?

24:12.041 --> 24:15.417
You say "anyway" every time
you wanna change the subject.

24:15.417 --> 24:16.625
No, I don't.

24:16.625 --> 24:20.917
You look to the left,
say "um," then "anyway."

24:24.375 --> 24:26.041
[phone ringing]

24:28.834 --> 24:31.583
I should get that.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.583
- Hello?
- [man] Hi, Mr. Davis.

24:36.583 --> 24:39.000
This is Mark
with Fortified Insurance

24:39.000 --> 24:42.625
with a fantastic coverage
package for your home.
How does that sound?

24:42.625 --> 24:47.542
- Great.
- We can offer earthquake,
flood, fire.

24:48.542 --> 24:51.917
We can save you up to 30%.

24:56.208 --> 24:57.917
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Davis.

24:57.917 --> 25:00.250
No, no, no.
Thanks for your time.

25:03.834 --> 25:06.250
Oh, you're going?

25:06.250 --> 25:08.583
Uh... You should get on
with your day.

25:08.583 --> 25:11.583
- Really?
- It seems like
you got a lot going on.

25:11.583 --> 25:13.917
Yeah, I guess.

25:13.917 --> 25:18.208
Actually, I'm playing Barney
at this kids' party later.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.041
And I should check
those messages.

25:25.041 --> 25:26.417
[cell phone beeps]

25:26.417 --> 25:28.417
[Adam] J.C. Buddy.
Saturday morning.

25:28.417 --> 25:31.667
Tried your cell.
Where are you? Call me.

25:31.667 --> 25:33.583
J.C.

25:33.583 --> 25:36.875
- Could you give me a lift home?
- Yeah.

25:36.875 --> 25:38.083
OK.

25:40.375 --> 25:43.875
- Let me put on some pants.
- [Dave] Barney!
Barney! Barney!

25:55.041 --> 25:57.458
I'll call you later.

25:58.959 --> 25:59.959
OK.

26:06.917 --> 26:11.458
- You know, I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?

26:11.458 --> 26:16.917
I shouldn't have asked you,
you know, about you.

26:20.417 --> 26:23.917
Um... anyway...

26:25.417 --> 26:27.125
I had fun today.

26:28.291 --> 26:31.333
- Me too.
- OK.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.291
[cell phone ringing]

26:43.291 --> 26:47.458
- Brian.
- Dave, hey. It's me.
Where are you?

26:47.458 --> 26:50.792
Uh...
I'm at the costume shop, hon.

26:50.792 --> 26:53.917
Honey, it's Larissa's birthday,
you know?

26:53.917 --> 26:55.959
So let's just
call a truce, OK?

26:55.959 --> 26:57.458
Yeah, OK, fine. Truce.

26:57.458 --> 26:59.750
And could
you maybe swing by Ralphs

26:59.750 --> 27:02.750
and pick up three dozen or so
of those really epic cupcakes?

27:04.667 --> 27:07.875
Yeah, yeah. I can do that
as soon as I'm done here, OK?

27:07.875 --> 27:11.125
OK, but hurry because
the party is in one hour.

27:11.125 --> 27:12.834
All right.

27:18.625 --> 27:20.792
[knocking]

27:23.166 --> 27:27.083
I have absolutely no idea.
I've been driving around just...

27:27.083 --> 27:32.041
- No idea what?
- No idea why I'm 32 and single.

27:32.041 --> 27:34.917
Everyone I know is paired off,
but not me.

27:34.917 --> 27:37.083
And sometimes
that freaks me out.

27:38.709 --> 27:39.917
Stop me anytime.

27:43.792 --> 27:47.208
That's why maybe
I change the subject.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.834
I'm not sure
why I look to the left, but...

27:52.542 --> 27:54.542
I'm sorry.

27:54.542 --> 27:58.000
Because the last thing
I wanna do is screw this up.

28:10.250 --> 28:14.291
- W... What are you doing here?
- Sweatshirt, Mm-hm.

28:14.291 --> 28:16.291
I had to see
what you were wearing.

28:16.291 --> 28:18.583
I had zero notice.
I would've changed.

28:22.166 --> 28:23.917
Oh, um...

28:23.917 --> 28:27.041
I felt bad you had to work
on a Saturday, and I was doing
errands.

28:27.041 --> 28:32.125
I had to go to a costume shop,
pick up a Barney.

28:32.125 --> 28:36.875
Anyway, there was a DVD store
near there, and I thought
that...

28:36.875 --> 28:39.250
You know what?
How about I just give it to you?

28:40.083 --> 28:42.083
I just brought you that.

28:44.208 --> 28:45.917
Diner. Oh.

28:45.917 --> 28:48.458
We can't IM on the same level
until you see it.

28:48.458 --> 28:52.458
Well, what's your favorite part,
so that I know when I get to it?

28:52.458 --> 28:55.458
OK. Ask me
what's on the flipside.

28:55.458 --> 28:57.083
What's on the flipside?

28:57.083 --> 29:00.917
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
1958, Specialty Records.

29:00.917 --> 29:05.583
Which will make a lot more sense
when you watch the movie.

29:05.583 --> 29:08.000
Well, maybe
you should talk me through it.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.458
You wanna watch it with me,
come in?

29:14.125 --> 29:18.959
I can't.
Uh... I can't. My...

29:18.959 --> 29:22.542
It's my daughter's
birthday today.

29:22.542 --> 29:25.166
- Ah, hence the Barney.
- Yes.

29:25.166 --> 29:29.000
- How old is she?
- She's five. Today.

29:30.458 --> 29:32.959
Well, thanks for the movie.

29:32.959 --> 29:35.959
But I think I'll wait
to watch it with you.

29:38.333 --> 29:40.000
OK.

29:50.291 --> 29:53.500
Hi, you guys. Get a little
closer. Why don't you get
a room?

Take that for me,
please, would you?

You have to do Barney.

30:07.458 --> 30:11.291
I can't do it. I'm Barney's
personal documentarian.
Hi, Ms. Deena.

30:11.291 --> 30:15.375
You have to do it.
Hi. Happy Birthday, Larissa.

30:15.375 --> 30:17.959
Have you ever been intimate
with a dinosaur?

30:17.959 --> 30:20.667
- At least get Angelo to do it.
- Ange.

30:20.667 --> 30:23.166
- Ange, come here.
- Dave.

30:23.166 --> 30:27.458
The pizza is not bad,
but the problem is,
it's not real mozzarella.

30:27.458 --> 30:29.834
It's not Naples.
It's a kids' party.

30:29.834 --> 30:32.250
We need a favor.
Could you be a dinosaur?

30:32.250 --> 30:35.125
- Dinosaur.
That is like Godzilla?
- Yeah.

30:38.458 --> 30:40.417
- That's not gonna work.
- Adam.

30:40.417 --> 30:43.208
I can't. I got something to do.
It's very important.

30:43.208 --> 30:47.709
Look at me. I'm a kangaroo.
Kangaroo, kangaroo.

30:47.709 --> 30:51.583
Who's the kanga? Who's the
kangaroo? Come on, bounce
it out.

30:51.583 --> 30:55.208

a little bit.
- Bri! Bri!

- Brian, listen,
where you been all day?
- What are you talking about?

30:58.959 --> 31:02.000
- I needed you
to pick up Barney.
- You always pick up Barney.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.041
- Lisa, this is Dave.
- Great to meet you. Let's go.

you made these.

- What is that?

31:26.875 --> 31:30.417
- What?
- The thing on the...
The costume.

31:30.417 --> 31:34.458
- You told me to put on Barney.
- Take off the head.

31:34.458 --> 31:36.709
- That's not Barney.
- Barney is purple.

31:36.709 --> 31:39.583
- This was in the bag.
- They gave me the wrong one.

31:39.583 --> 31:42.834
The gave me a B-list dinosaur.
I got a Jurassic nobody.

31:42.834 --> 31:46.250
- You didn't check it?
- No, I was in a rush.
I grabbed it.

31:46.250 --> 31:48.959
You were supposed to be there.
This is your fault.

31:48.959 --> 31:52.750
- Why is it my fault?
- 'Cause I called you 40 times.

31:52.750 --> 31:56.667
I don't wanna talk about it.
Put on the dinosaur and let's
have some fun.

31:56.667 --> 31:59.291
A little bit of fun.
Some fun.

32:01.375 --> 32:04.208
Don't look at me.
You blew me off too.

- OK, kids.
Everybody needs to...

You OK? All right, settle down.
I've got some news.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Barney couldn't
make it today.

Sometimes you have to sit back,
let them talk, you listen,

38:58.041 --> 39:02.250
and then you do what you wanna
do, what you have to do on the
serious stuff.

39:04.166 --> 39:08.208
Sometimes decisions
have to be made by yourself.

39:08.208 --> 39:12.917
Something tells me we're not
talking about soup tureens.

39:16.333 --> 39:20.375
I'm just hormonal.
I'm so hormonal.

39:22.083 --> 39:24.709
- You think the boys
are having fun?
- Who cares?

39:24.709 --> 39:29.709
[singing]

39:29.709 --> 39:34.458
- I just don't get this game.
- Just sing. It's fun.

39:52.083 --> 39:54.333
- [girl giggling]
- [dog grunts]

39:54.333 --> 39:57.000
[phone ringing]

39:57.000 --> 40:00.250
- Come on.
- You gotta be kidding me.

40:00.250 --> 40:02.375
- Hi, Needles.
- Wanna take him for a walk?

40:02.375 --> 40:04.917
- Yeah, we should.
- I'll get his leash.

40:04.917 --> 40:06.458
You wanna go for a walk?

40:06.458 --> 40:08.959
[Marjorie] I'm sorry
I called you 25 times today.

40:08.959 --> 40:11.208
Your friends
are really nice, Brian.

40:11.208 --> 40:14.125
- I love you
and Adam loves you.
- They owe me that.

40:14.125 --> 40:16.625
Of course
you should have your Saturday.

40:16.625 --> 40:18.959
And I like Lisa.
She seems great.

40:20.875 --> 40:24.959
And it's like you said before,
we just have to stop wondering
"What if?"

40:26.917 --> 40:29.792
OK, bye.

40:29.792 --> 40:32.083
[answering machine beeps]

40:32.083 --> 40:34.125
[♪♪]

40:34.125 --> 40:37.792
Wow.
That's a world killer.

40:40.875 --> 40:44.291
- Stan! Stan! Stan! Stan!
- [Deena and Dave laugh]

40:45.667 --> 40:48.166
[Larissa] Mommy,
I can't sleep.

40:50.125 --> 40:52.917
- It's totally my turn.
It's my turn.
- Nope nope nope.

40:52.917 --> 40:55.500
- Please, please.
- No. I'll get her.

40:55.500 --> 40:56.875
OK?

41:03.333 --> 41:06.458
[Geneva] Mommy,
Larissa's bugging me.

41:06.458 --> 41:08.834
- Mommy!
- [Deena] Coming.

41:39.041 --> 41:40.834
You gotta be kidding me.

41:48.458 --> 41:50.041
That guy?
