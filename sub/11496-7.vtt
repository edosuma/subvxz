WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:04.403
(conversation, laughter)

00:04.405 --> 00:06.238
Thank you.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.040
Wow. She's cute.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.408
She sure is.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.143
She sucks
in bed.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.212
And not in a good way.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.147
Her, too?

00:15.149 --> 00:16.281
I-I didn't even know
she was gay.

00:16.283 --> 00:19.118
Neither did she,
till last Thursday.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.087
You're like some
kind of lesbian zombie

00:22.089 --> 00:24.223
Infecting all
the women of malibu.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.224
Ha!

00:25.226 --> 00:26.458
I like that.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.527
(as zombie):
Must have vagina.

00:29.562 --> 00:32.431
(as zombie):
Must have vagina.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.867
Sounds like some kind of
weird help wanted ad

00:34.869 --> 00:35.868
Alan would place.

00:35.870 --> 00:36.935
(chuckles)

00:38.071 --> 00:39.772
So when did you realize
that you were gay?

00:39.774 --> 00:40.773
Oh, oh...

00:40.775 --> 00:42.007
What's that I hear?

00:42.009 --> 00:44.343
Is that your own closet door
finally swinging open?

00:44.345 --> 00:46.145
Trust me,
if I was gay

00:46.147 --> 00:47.646
You'd be the first
one to know.

00:49.282 --> 00:51.116
You know, I think I was
in high school

00:51.118 --> 00:52.518
When I figured it out.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.153
A bunch of my friends
were having a sleepover

00:54.155 --> 00:55.888
And we started talking about

00:55.890 --> 00:57.523
What it would be like
to kiss a boy

00:57.525 --> 00:58.824
And who was the best kisser.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.726
So me and my friend kimberly,

01:00.728 --> 01:02.161
Who was a cheerleader,

01:02.163 --> 01:04.229
Decided to settle it
by making out.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.364
A-a cheerleader?

01:05.366 --> 01:07.666
Let the woman talk.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.601
Kimberly was so hot.

01:09.603 --> 01:13.038
I still remember
how soft her lips felt

01:13.040 --> 01:15.707
As she slipped
her hand under my shirt

01:15.709 --> 01:18.377
And kissed her way down my body.

01:21.181 --> 01:24.283
Must've been a strange and
confusing time for you.

01:25.552 --> 01:26.919
Please continue.

01:26.921 --> 01:30.189
She closed her eyes.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.957
She parted her lips.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.526
She arched her back

01:34.528 --> 01:37.162
And I whispered in her ear,

01:37.164 --> 01:40.265
"oh, my god,

01:40.267 --> 01:42.201
"kimberly,

01:42.203 --> 01:43.769
"I can't believe

01:43.771 --> 01:45.804
"these two idiots

01:45.806 --> 01:47.873
Actually believe this story."

01:51.678 --> 01:53.078
And then what happe...
Aw!

01:53.080 --> 01:54.980
Damn it!

01:54.982 --> 01:56.682
It's not that complicated.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.218
The first time you masturbate
thinking about the school nurse

01:59.220 --> 02:00.419
You pretty much know.

02:00.421 --> 02:03.422
Both:
Oh, my god, I'm a lesbian.

02:06.659 --> 02:08.994
We need to start
hanging out with
girls who aren't gay.

02:08.996 --> 02:09.995
Or related to us.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.497
How 'bout her?

02:13.633 --> 02:15.868
Oh, I suppose I could
go talk to her.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.536
I think jenny was
talking about me.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.037
Oh, really?

02:19.039 --> 02:20.973
And you assume that
just because you're
rich and good-looking?

02:20.975 --> 02:23.142
No, I was going to say
smart and charming,

02:23.144 --> 02:25.244
But if you mix all those
ingredients together,

02:25.246 --> 02:27.646
You make one delicious
hot guy pie.

02:27.648 --> 02:31.250
Well, your "hot guy pie"
is no match for my system.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.384
No, hold on.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.952
Going on craigslist
and looking up "escorts"

02:33.954 --> 02:34.987
Isn't a system.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.155
That is not my system,

02:36.157 --> 02:38.390
That is my backup plan.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.325
My system consists
of the three "c"s:

02:40.327 --> 02:43.095
Connect, charm and cry.

02:43.097 --> 02:44.730
Works every time.

02:44.732 --> 02:45.898
Uh, okay...

02:45.900 --> 02:47.432
"hi, my name's alan.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.035
"that is a beautiful
blouse you're wearing.

02:50.037 --> 02:52.371
My dead wife was buried
in one just like it."

02:53.573 --> 02:55.674
Yeah, my system's
a lot simpler.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.942
I wait for you
to finish talking

02:56.944 --> 02:58.210
And then I
take them home.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.512
Oh, oh, big words
coming from somebody

03:00.514 --> 03:02.247
Sitting alone
next to me.
Oh.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.383
Okay, fine.
Well, let's just go see
who she likes better.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.088
Oh, my god.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.657
No one is safe.

03:17.130 --> 03:20.132
♪ men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

03:20.134 --> 03:21.633
♪ ah.
♪ men.
♪ men.

03:25.171 --> 03:26.838
(indistinct conversations)

03:26.840 --> 03:29.575
Hey, do you think all women
are potentially lesbians?

03:29.577 --> 03:31.810
Um, I have 30 years

03:31.812 --> 03:33.779
Of masturbating to porn
that say yes.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.015
You know,
you brag more

03:37.017 --> 03:38.183
About your
masturbating prowess

03:38.185 --> 03:39.418
Than any person
I know.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.988
It ain't bragging
if it's true.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.357
Ooh. Alpha bravo,
two bogeys on your six.

03:47.026 --> 03:48.427
Why are you
talking like that?

03:48.429 --> 03:50.462
Oh, my...
Did you have a stroke?

03:50.464 --> 03:51.830
It's airplane talk.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.065
I'm your wingman.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.000
It... It just means
two cute girls
just walked in.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.636
Why didn't you just say
two cute girls
just walked in?

03:57.638 --> 03:58.870
Roger that.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.539
Will you stop that?
Over and out.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.143
Wow.
Yeah.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.311
They are cute.
Yeah, yeah.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.046
So, uh... So what's
the play here?

04:08.048 --> 04:09.948
Um, uh... How about
something like, uh...

04:09.950 --> 04:11.817
"hey, uh, those
seats are taken,

04:11.819 --> 04:13.585
But our faces aren't"?

04:15.655 --> 04:17.222
How about,
"I'm walden,

04:17.224 --> 04:19.491
And this is my
mute friend alan"?

04:20.460 --> 04:21.793
Fine.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.795
You think you've got such
great game, lead the way,

04:23.797 --> 04:26.531
Mr. "I'm too good for
craigslist and masturbating."

04:30.003 --> 04:31.003
Hi.

04:31.005 --> 04:32.771
Hi.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.177
That's all I got.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.348
Uh, ladies, uh, uh,
how much does
a polar bear weigh?

04:43.350 --> 04:45.150
Oh, I don't know.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.019
Enough to break the ice.
I'm dr. Alan harper.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.955
Uh, this is my associate
walden schmidt.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.456
Google him,
he's rich.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.859
If you google me,
you can see my boobs.

04:55.094 --> 04:57.296
Also if you do this.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.598
Hi.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.233
Oh, oh, uh,
take another look,

05:01.235 --> 05:03.035
But this time
spell "attic."

05:04.103 --> 05:07.105
A-t-t-I-c.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.940
Oh! I get it.

05:09.842 --> 05:11.510
Because these are my tee-tees

05:11.512 --> 05:13.612
And I see them.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.214
I'm sorry
about my friend.
I'm sorry
about my friend.

05:17.717 --> 05:19.418
Walden.
Jill.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.286
So, alan, what kind of
doctor are you?

05:21.288 --> 05:22.287
Oh, I'm a...

05:22.289 --> 05:24.022
A chiropractor...

05:24.024 --> 05:25.390
Slash brain surgeon.

05:25.392 --> 05:26.925
Oh!

05:26.927 --> 05:28.460
So, uh, w-what do
you guys do?

05:28.462 --> 05:31.096
We're princesses
at a theme park.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.264
Really?

05:32.266 --> 05:33.899
Yeah, I play
cinderella

05:33.901 --> 05:35.067
And she's the
little mermaid.

05:35.069 --> 05:36.568
Oh, well, that
certainly makes sense

05:36.570 --> 05:37.803
Because, uh,
you "swept"

05:37.805 --> 05:39.638
My friend
off his feet

05:39.640 --> 05:42.074
And-and I'm
"hooked" on you.

05:42.076 --> 05:43.575
Oh, my god,
that's funny

05:43.577 --> 05:44.910
Because I'm a fish.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.244
(laughing)
yes.

05:46.246 --> 05:49.081
The answer to the question
you're not asking is:

05:49.083 --> 05:51.116
Because she makes
me look smart.

05:51.118 --> 05:54.486
Well, the answer
to the question
you're not asking is:

05:54.488 --> 05:56.288
Because he won't
move out.

06:00.626 --> 06:02.394
Morning.
Oh, hey.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.528
How great
was last night?

06:03.530 --> 06:04.963
It was pretty good.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.398
Those girls didn't know
what hit 'em.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.167
What'd you use,
chloroform or tasers?

06:09.169 --> 06:10.902
I will have you know

06:10.904 --> 06:12.337
That walden and I
have dates tonight

06:12.339 --> 06:14.206
With two theme park princesses.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.108
Mine's cinderella.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.676
Perfect for you.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.745
Storybook beauty.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.413
And mine is the little mermaid.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.814
Perfect for you.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.383
No legs to run away.

06:28.254 --> 06:30.288
I'm telling you,
if we play our cards right,

06:30.290 --> 06:33.024
We're gonna get ourselves
some fairy-tail.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.160
"fairy-tail"?

06:35.162 --> 06:37.496
Because, you know,
"tail" has two meanings.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.264
Yeah, so does "fairy."

06:41.401 --> 06:42.501
Hey, guys.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.702
Alan:
Hi.
Hey.

06:43.704 --> 06:44.736
This is maria.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.937
Maria, this is walden
and alan.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.105
Oh, that's so cool.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.807
You didn't tell me
your parents were gay.

06:51.611 --> 06:53.111
Didn't I?

06:53.113 --> 06:54.613
Dad and mom.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.249
Hi.
It's nice
to meet you.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.583
Uh, listen,
I gotta go.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.352
But you are going
to call me, right?

07:00.354 --> 07:02.154
Absolutely.
You sure?

07:02.156 --> 07:03.455
Yes.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.590
I would not lie to you
in front of my parents.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.659
Bye, it was nice meeting you.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.862
Don't be a stranger, dear.

07:12.331 --> 07:15.100
That's not the girl you
picked up in the bar last night.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.902
No, she delivered the pizza

07:16.904 --> 07:19.371
To me and the girl I picked up
at the bar last night.

07:20.973 --> 07:23.675
Well, I hope you gave her
a good tip.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.044
Nah, she didn't come
in 30 minutes or less.

07:32.485 --> 07:33.485
Whoa.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.553
(imitates siren)

07:34.555 --> 07:35.954
Fashion police.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.889
Pull over.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.291
What?

07:39.293 --> 07:40.725
The reason I stopped you

07:40.727 --> 07:43.562
Is it appears
your style has expired.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.298
You don't like
this sweater?

07:46.300 --> 07:47.299
I thought it
looked good.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.734
Have you been drinking, sir?

07:49.736 --> 07:51.803
This coming
from a man

07:51.805 --> 07:54.506
Who looks like he's been
tented for termites.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.610
(doorbell rings)

08:00.980 --> 08:01.980
Lyndsey.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.281
Hi, alan.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.950
Uh, did we have
plans for tonight?

08:04.952 --> 08:06.585
No, I was
in the area

08:06.587 --> 08:08.386
And I thought I'd surprise
you with a booty call.

08:08.388 --> 08:09.888
Oh. Wow.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.623
Well, normally that would
be delightful, but...
Wait.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.261
You're wearing cologne
and your one good shirt.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.631
You have a date.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.967
Oh, no, I-I wouldn't
call it a date,

08:21.969 --> 08:23.568
You know, uh, um...

08:23.570 --> 08:25.570
Walden met this woman,

08:25.572 --> 08:28.440
And she's got a friend,
really ugly.

08:28.442 --> 08:29.741
Mm-hmm.
(chuckling)

08:29.743 --> 08:30.976
You know how
they say, you know,

08:30.978 --> 08:32.277
People were beaten
with the ugly stick?

08:32.279 --> 08:33.745
Well...
Well, you know,

08:33.747 --> 08:35.814
If you took a bunch
of the ugly sticks

08:35.816 --> 08:37.582
And built an ugly house,

08:37.584 --> 08:40.218
When this girl
walked by,

08:40.220 --> 08:42.621
The house would
call her ugly.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.525
Alan, relax.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.660
You're allowed to date.
Oh, really?

08:48.662 --> 08:50.428
Of course. I mean,
I have a boyfriend.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.898
Oh, thank god,
'cause this girl is
actually way hot.

08:52.900 --> 08:53.965
(laughs)

08:53.967 --> 08:55.634
I mean, you know,
not as hot as you,

08:55.636 --> 08:56.968
But, you know,
young-hot.

08:58.738 --> 09:01.706
You've been hot
a lot longer.

09:06.078 --> 09:08.079
I'm gonna go.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.080
You sure you're
okay with this?

09:09.082 --> 09:10.549
I'm sure.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.751
Go have fun.

09:12.753 --> 09:15.720
Oh, that's my good old lyndsey.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.056
I didn't mean "old"!

09:18.058 --> 09:19.925
(imitates siren)

09:22.361 --> 09:23.795
Idiot police.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.297
Pull over.

09:30.036 --> 09:32.070
God, it's great out here.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.039
The stars look amazing.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.541
Yeah, without the lights
from the city,
they really pop.

09:36.543 --> 09:39.277
That's why you can see
orion's belt so clearly.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.080
Uh, you know, if you
look under orion's belt,

09:42.082 --> 09:44.082
Uh, you can see
his little dipper.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.250
(laughs)

09:45.252 --> 09:46.251
Oh, my god,
you are so bad.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.452
(laughing)

09:47.454 --> 09:48.753
You're into astronomy?

09:48.755 --> 09:49.754
'cause I've been
into astronomy

09:49.756 --> 09:50.822
Since I went
to space camp.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.658
Also about the same
time I got into

09:53.660 --> 09:55.794
Getting my ass kicked
at school.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.797
I always wanted
to go to space camp.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.432
Nerd!

10:00.434 --> 10:02.467
I prefer "geek."

10:04.236 --> 10:05.570
Wh-what about you,
laurie?

10:05.572 --> 10:06.571
Are you into
astronomy?

10:06.573 --> 10:08.873
Yep, I'm a virgo.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.142
But I'm not a virgin.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.080
Both good signs
for me.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.749
So, uh, how did you become
a princess, anyway?

10:17.751 --> 10:20.452
Oh, I get that a lot.

10:20.454 --> 10:23.922
(whispering):
I'm not a real princess.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.291
I'm also not
a real redhead.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.659
You'll find
that out later.

10:29.428 --> 10:32.097
No way, it must be great
being a princess.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.365
Yeah, for the most part.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.700
What's not so great
are the pervy dads

10:35.702 --> 10:37.869
Who are trying
to cop a feel.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.304
The other day I was like,

10:39.306 --> 10:40.872
"do that again,
you're gonna find out

10:40.874 --> 10:42.774
Where else
my glass slipper fits."

10:42.776 --> 10:45.210
Is it weird that
that turns me on?

10:45.212 --> 10:47.879
Is it weird
that's why I told you?

10:47.881 --> 10:50.148
So, hey, would you girls like
a little more champagne?

10:50.150 --> 10:51.349
Oh, I would!
(laughs)

10:51.351 --> 10:52.550
I love champagne.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.386
And puppies!

10:54.388 --> 10:56.087
Um, what's the magic word?

10:56.089 --> 10:58.990
Oh... Boobs!

10:58.992 --> 11:01.059
Ah, the kids must love you.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.667
I really like jill.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.036
I mean, she's fun, she's
beautiful, she's smart.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.404
And I really like laurie--
she's fun,

11:12.406 --> 11:15.340
She's beautiful, she's stupid.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.409
So, uh, what's the next move?

11:17.411 --> 11:20.211
I'm gonna take jill up to my
room and show her my telescope.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.279
What am I gonna do?
There's nothing

11:21.281 --> 11:22.380
In my room to show laurie.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.515
Yes, there is.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.350
You have a couch
that turns into a bed.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.651
She'll be amazed.

11:30.222 --> 11:31.589
Okay, open your eyes.

11:31.591 --> 11:34.459
Oh, my god!

11:34.461 --> 11:36.261
Where'd the couch go?

11:36.263 --> 11:37.829
Ah-ah-ah!

11:37.831 --> 11:39.964
A magician never
reveals his secrets.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.634
That's amazing.

11:42.636 --> 11:43.835
And for my next trick,

11:43.837 --> 11:45.837
I'm going to make
my penis disappear.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.005
(gasps)

11:47.007 --> 11:49.107
I'll need a volunteer
from the audience.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.942
Ooh, pick me, pick me!

11:50.944 --> 11:52.243
Um...

11:52.245 --> 11:53.812
(laughs)

11:55.181 --> 11:56.881
(cell phone ringing)

11:56.883 --> 11:58.016
(grunts)

11:58.018 --> 11:59.417
Oh, sorry, um...

11:59.419 --> 12:01.986
Uh, my mom.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.021
No problem.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.090
I'll go put in a condom.

12:05.092 --> 12:08.193
Uh, uh, that's not how...

12:08.195 --> 12:09.694
You know what? Great.

12:12.331 --> 12:13.331
Lyndsey?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.934
Alan? Thanks for calling.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.335
You called me.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.403
Oh, that's good 'cause I was

12:18.405 --> 12:19.838
Just gonna call you.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.072
Lyndsey, you're drunk.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.841
Alan, you're boring.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.109
Okay, I'm gonna go.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.210
Whoa, whoa, wait!

12:25.212 --> 12:26.978
Just one thing.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.747
Remember when I told you
I was okay

12:28.749 --> 12:29.881
With you dating other people?

12:29.883 --> 12:30.882
Uh-huh.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.083
Well, I'm not.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.418
You're not?

12:33.420 --> 12:35.120
(door opens)

12:35.122 --> 12:37.622
I'm ready
for your next trick.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.725
Can I call you back? I'm...

12:40.727 --> 12:42.794
Going into a tunnel.

12:47.633 --> 12:51.035
So, what do you think
of your princess?

12:51.037 --> 12:53.204
I think I am enchanted.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.306
And engorged.

12:55.308 --> 12:58.143
Well, let's see
about giving this story

12:58.145 --> 13:00.211
A happy ending.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.813
Uh, can you hold on
for a second?

13:01.815 --> 13:02.747
Oh.
Oh, oh!

13:02.749 --> 13:04.516
Uh, not what I meant.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.618
But... Big thumbs-up.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.619
Oh, oh!

13:07.621 --> 13:09.721
It was a...

13:09.723 --> 13:12.390
It was a metaphorical thumbs-up.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.793
Uh, and-and you work
with children.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.094
Is everything all right?

13:16.096 --> 13:18.263
Uh, yeah, yeah, uh, uh,
can you just, uh,

13:18.265 --> 13:20.131
Hang on a minute?
I've got to freshen up.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.633
Oh, the bathroom's right there.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.302
Yeah, no, I have to...

13:24.304 --> 13:26.371
Poop.

13:27.339 --> 13:29.040
Okay.

13:29.042 --> 13:32.177
Check out this star.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.145
Is that the guy from <i>survivor?</i>

13:34.147 --> 13:36.614
Yeah, jeff probst.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.850
He's naked and cooking...

13:38.852 --> 13:39.851
Bacon?

13:39.853 --> 13:41.486
Yeah, he does it every night.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.289
It's a regular bacon
and sausage fest.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.791
And why do you watch?

13:46.793 --> 13:48.326
Uh, there's not much on tv.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.761
But... More importantly...

13:49.763 --> 13:52.497
I think he wants me to.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.166
Well, maybe if there
was something better

13:55.168 --> 13:56.467
For you to look at?

13:56.469 --> 13:57.869
Oh.

13:57.871 --> 13:58.870
(loud knocking)

13:58.872 --> 14:00.572
Alan:
Walden! Walden!

14:00.574 --> 14:03.241
I know! Probst is cooking.

14:05.144 --> 14:08.112
Alan:
No, no! It-it's an emergency.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.014
I'm sorry, it's...
Mm-hmm.

14:12.551 --> 14:13.651
What?

14:13.653 --> 14:14.719
Lyndsey called me.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.120
Oh, my god.
Yeah.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.323
Why didn't you say that
from the beginning?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.926
(loud knocking)

14:25.731 --> 14:27.999
She told me she is not okay
with me dating someone else.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.934
She has a boyfriend, okay?

14:29.936 --> 14:32.437
What she's doing
to you is not fair.
So what should I do?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.606
You should do what every boy in
america has dreamed about doing,

14:34.608 --> 14:37.008
And go downstairs
and bang the little mermaid.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.144
You're right.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.013
A bush in the hand
and all that.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.915
Well, I'd tell you
to go screw her brains out,

14:43.917 --> 14:45.516
But somebody already
beat you to it.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.821
(cell phone ringing)

14:49.823 --> 14:51.489
Aw, great.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.224
Um...

14:53.226 --> 14:55.426
Hi, lynds.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.896
No, no, you have, uh,
nothing to apologize for.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.865
I-I sent her home.

15:00.867 --> 15:04.502
You left a surprise for me?

15:04.504 --> 15:05.870
Oh...

15:05.872 --> 15:07.238
You didn't have to do that.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.774
Surprise!

15:09.776 --> 15:11.442
Lyndsey?
Yeah.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.811
I felt bad
about ruining your date

15:13.813 --> 15:16.214
So I wanted
to make it up to you.
Oh.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.483
Laurie:
Alan, where are you?

15:18.485 --> 15:19.851
Who was that?

15:19.853 --> 15:21.519
Oh, uh, that's just
a tv show I'm watching.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.520
It's called...

15:22.522 --> 15:24.522
<i>Alan, where are you?</i>

15:24.524 --> 15:25.790
Um, well,

15:25.792 --> 15:27.125
You know what?
Thanks for dropping by,

15:27.127 --> 15:28.226
But I'm gonna have
to take a rain check.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.794
So I will see you soon.

15:29.796 --> 15:32.730
Are you done pooping?

15:32.732 --> 15:33.731
(groans)

15:33.733 --> 15:35.199
Whoop!

15:35.201 --> 15:36.968
Who the hell is this?

15:36.970 --> 15:38.736
Ooh, I'm so sorry.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.071
Is this your mom?

15:41.407 --> 15:43.908
Bitch, you are gonna die!

15:43.910 --> 15:45.643
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.212
I thought you said
you sent the slut home.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.315
How does she know I'm a slut?

15:50.317 --> 15:53.251
Okay, okay, this-this is just
a classic misunderstanding.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.853
It-it's like a bad episode
of   <i>alan, where are you?</i>

15:57.222 --> 15:58.690
You lied to me!

15:58.692 --> 16:00.291
I was just about
to kick her out.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.726
You were about to kick me out?

16:01.728 --> 16:03.494
I wasn't. I was.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.529
I wasn't.

16:04.531 --> 16:05.530
Walden:
Hey.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.731
What is going on?

16:06.733 --> 16:09.233
Alan's mom thinks I'm a slut.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.569
Alan's cheating on me.

16:11.571 --> 16:12.870
Uh, you have a boyfriend!

16:12.872 --> 16:14.639
Now who's the slut?

16:14.641 --> 16:15.907
Ooh, ooh!

16:15.909 --> 16:17.308
Okay, maybe...

16:17.310 --> 16:18.376
We should just get
our things and go.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.410
No, no, no, no, no, no!

16:19.412 --> 16:20.478
Don't-don't get your things.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.779
I like your things.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.148
I haven't even
seen your things.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.184
I really think we
should call it a night.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.819
No, alan, do something!

16:27.821 --> 16:29.020
Uh, o-okay, what we're
gonna do is...

16:29.022 --> 16:32.256
(retching)

16:33.859 --> 16:35.927
Whoa!

16:37.096 --> 16:40.498
Whoa.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.567
Must have vagina!

16:47.740 --> 16:49.540
Morning.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.877
Hey, sorry for puking
in the living room last night.

16:52.879 --> 16:53.778
What?

16:53.780 --> 16:55.046
I think I just drank

16:55.048 --> 16:56.414
A little too much.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.915
Oh, th-that wasn't you.
That was lyndsey.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.585
Oh, awesome!

17:00.587 --> 17:03.788
Guess who doesn't have
a drinking problem.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.691
Morning.
Morning.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.493
Sorry again about last night.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.129
You know what?
I really liked jill.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.797
What happened was
out of my control.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.499
No, it wasn't!

17:14.501 --> 17:17.068
This whole non-relationship
relationship thing

17:17.070 --> 17:19.070
You have going on
with lyndsey is ridiculous.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.505
And now it's affecting me.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.074
You owe me a princess
and an area rug.

17:24.643 --> 17:26.811
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
Nothing.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.447
The only person who got hot,
drunk sex last night

17:29.449 --> 17:31.482
Was lyndsey's boyfriend.

17:31.484 --> 17:32.717
Actually...

17:32.719 --> 17:34.185
Okay, fine.
Him and you.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.621
Well...
Aw, damn it!

17:40.426 --> 17:42.493
(doorbell rings)

17:47.066 --> 17:48.366
Lyndsey, can we talk?

17:48.368 --> 17:50.902
Sure, I've been puking
at 20-minute intervals.

17:50.904 --> 17:54.072
So... You got eight minutes.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.374
Look, a-about last night...

17:56.376 --> 17:58.276
I-I am really sorry.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.211
I-I was totally out of line.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.046
It's just...
I started picturing you

18:02.048 --> 18:04.415
With some other girl
and I got so jealous.

I mean...

18:06.252 --> 18:07.718
Isn't that crazy?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.187
It's you.

18:10.222 --> 18:12.824
Ouch, there was an iron fist

18:12.826 --> 18:14.659
In that velvet glove.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.128
Um, look.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.663
I want to be with you.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.498

18:20.500 --> 18:23.434
You and larry

Well, it's not that simple.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.777
I can't just choose.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.812

break up with larry?

18:52.098 --> 18:54.398
Yes.
Aw, great.

It feels so good
to be back in your arms.

Larry.
