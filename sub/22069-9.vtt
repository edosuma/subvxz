00:31.599 --> 00:33.033
Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick...

00:33.067 --> 00:34.702
Hey, man, what happened?

00:34.735 --> 00:36.304
Go, go get her!
What?

00:36.337 --> 00:38.606
Who?
Emily. Emily, she...

00:38.639 --> 00:39.673
Where?

00:39.707 --> 00:41.809
There. There! Go!

01:34.094 --> 01:35.296
MAN: What is she doing?

01:42.203 --> 01:44.805
MAN: Over here!
Over here!

01:51.412 --> 01:52.580
Move it!

01:53.581 --> 01:54.615
TOMMY: Move!

01:54.648 --> 01:55.649
Move!

01:55.883 --> 01:56.884
Move!

01:59.320 --> 02:00.321
Fuck!

02:03.123 --> 02:05.926
Suspect possibly southbound
on the Red Line

02:05.959 --> 02:07.361
between Davis and Porter.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.336
Flynn!

02:48.702 --> 02:50.571
Flynn! No.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.639
Flynn!

02:52.573 --> 02:53.674
Help!

02:54.875 --> 02:56.410
Help!

03:00.147 --> 03:01.349
Please...

03:02.149 --> 03:03.817
Listen to me.

03:03.851 --> 03:07.255
Don't hurt Flynn, please,
I'll do anything.

03:11.325 --> 03:14.662
Don't you touch him,
you lunatic!

03:14.695 --> 03:16.230
You hear me?

03:16.264 --> 03:18.299
You leave him alone!

03:18.332 --> 03:20.668
You want to hurt someone,
you hurt me!

05:46.614 --> 05:48.015
TRAIN DRIVER ON PA:
Ladies and gentlemen.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.851
Unfortunately,
we will be making
an emergency stop

05:50.884 --> 05:52.085
at the next station.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.987
Sorry for the inconvenience.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.114
Hi, you're going to want
to hold on, okay?

08:39.286 --> 08:40.287
TOMMY: You okay?

08:41.321 --> 08:42.756
You got her?

08:42.790 --> 08:43.791
No.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.663
Thanks.
Use that.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.001
She shot me.

08:55.402 --> 08:56.604
I know.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.209
Lucky you.

09:03.410 --> 09:04.845
It's not luck.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.248
It's mandatory for the field.

09:09.516 --> 09:10.718
Emily know that?

09:14.021 --> 09:16.724
She...
She knows we're on to her.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.592
She's trying to slow us down,

09:18.626 --> 09:20.828
to keep us from finding Alice
and Flynn.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.665
You being dead would have
slowed us down a lot more.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.534
No, you stopped...
You stopped to help.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.770
Dead men don't need first aid.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.043
She's always two steps ahead.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.511
Don't worry.
I've got it covered.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.047
I'm going to talk
to Charles Avallone

09:40.080 --> 09:42.482
to see why Emily came
all the way out here,
all right?

09:42.515 --> 09:45.152
No, no, no,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.587
What are you doing?
I'm coming with you.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.296
CHARLES:
We never wanted...

09:58.632 --> 10:00.901
We never wanted...

10:01.468 --> 10:02.836
No, no, no!

10:02.870 --> 10:03.837
Mr. Avallone is in no condition
to answer any questions.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.572
We need to speak
to Mr. Avallone.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.574
Yeah, because it's clear that
you sedated him.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.576
He was extremely agitated.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.711
That woman attacked him,

10:10.744 --> 10:12.880
and he was far from stable
to begin with.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.348
This, uh,
royal "we" stuff.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.050
Is he completely
delusional or...

10:17.084 --> 10:19.186
Tsk. Charles has an
adaptive fantasy,

10:19.687 --> 10:20.754
an imaginary friend.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.222
Yeah, well,
we're not so sure.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.591
You know, Charles' friend
might be real after all.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.494
Look, look, the woman
who attacked Charles

10:27.527 --> 10:28.628
is named Emily Byrne.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.698
She's wanted for
multiple homicide,

10:30.731 --> 10:32.800
and she's kidnapped
my wife and my son.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.136
He may know something
that can help us find them.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.471
He and Emily grew up
together in state care,

10:38.505 --> 10:39.539
at Barrett House.

10:39.572 --> 10:40.808
But Charles has been
here at Edgewater

10:40.841 --> 10:42.776
for more than 10 years.
I don't know how...

10:42.810 --> 10:44.177
I'm sorry.
I don't have time for this.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.479
Why else...
Why else would Emily
come all this way?

10:46.513 --> 10:47.715
Hey, hey,

10:48.115 --> 10:49.416
relax, man.

10:49.449 --> 10:50.650
Let me handle this.

10:51.985 --> 10:52.986
Okay?

10:56.790 --> 10:58.191
Sorry, he's, uh...

10:58.458 --> 10:59.827
Um...

11:01.461 --> 11:02.662
This guy...

11:03.764 --> 11:06.099
Dr. Shen, MIT scientist.

11:06.133 --> 11:09.402
Uh, he was experimenting on kids
at Barrett House.

11:09.436 --> 11:13.340
We've listened to his tapes,
interviews with the subjects.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.507
Um...

11:14.541 --> 11:15.608
Charles was one of them,

11:15.642 --> 11:19.546
and there was at least
one other kid.

11:19.579 --> 11:22.649
And you think that child
is Charles' imaginary friend?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.885
Yes, subject B.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.119
Charles

11:26.153 --> 11:29.056
was subject A.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.927
Okay.
He needs time to recover.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.796
How much time?
Well...

11:35.829 --> 11:37.030
Come back tomorrow.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.732
NICK: We don't...
We don't have a day.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.001
We may not even have hours.

11:42.635 --> 11:47.707
Shen ended up in a grave
with five other bodies.

11:47.741 --> 11:48.809
Eyelids cut off.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.710
That's the signature
of Conrad Harlow,

11:50.744 --> 11:53.680
a known serial killer.

11:53.713 --> 11:58.618
Now, I've looked at who pays
the bills for Charles here
at Edgewater...

11:58.651 --> 12:00.087
That's a family trust.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.588
It's been that way
since the beginning.

12:01.621 --> 12:06.994
Are you aware that this trust
is, uh, linked with
Conrad Harlow?

12:07.627 --> 12:09.429
Hmm?

12:12.632 --> 12:14.034
Your subject B.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.803
You think it's Emily Byrne,

12:15.836 --> 12:18.171
and you need Charles
to confirm that, right?

12:18.205 --> 12:19.840
NICK: Yes. I just...

12:19.873 --> 12:21.975
I just want to find my family.

16:18.545 --> 16:19.546
Housekeeping.

16:25.685 --> 16:26.686
Housekeeping.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.625
MAN 1: Hey! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

18:45.658 --> 18:47.059
Hey! Stop that woman!

18:47.093 --> 18:48.895
Grab her! Stop her!

18:50.863 --> 18:52.265
MAN 2: Hey! Stop! Ma'am!

18:53.966 --> 18:55.335
She's locked the door!

18:55.635 --> 18:56.903
Shit!

19:21.328 --> 19:22.629
MAN 3: There she is!

19:22.962 --> 19:25.198
Hey, stop!

19:25.798 --> 19:26.866
Stop!

19:34.341 --> 19:36.409
Don't move! Don't move.

19:36.743 --> 19:37.877
Get up.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.946
Open the door, now!
Come here.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.113
Get over there!

19:41.147 --> 19:42.449
Come on, let's go.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.783
Go, go, go!

19:43.816 --> 19:44.851
Hurry up.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.488
In, now!
Now, move, move!

19:48.521 --> 19:49.622
You too, in.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.196
God damn it, get over here.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.432
Don't move. Don't move.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.328
JACK: Em, talk to me.
Hey.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.797
I found a company
called Tri-King.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.733
They make tanks and aquariums.
I need you to track them down.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.169
Uh, what do they have to do
with whoever has Flynn?

21:43.202 --> 21:45.104
I think they made the tank
that held me.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.240
I need to find out who ordered
it and where it was sent.

21:48.274 --> 21:50.510
Okay, Tri-King. I'm on it.

21:51.678 --> 21:52.779
Okay.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.083
We have to go.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.839
Mom! No!

23:59.872 --> 24:00.873
Mom!

24:01.774 --> 24:02.809
Mom!

24:07.514 --> 24:09.582
Maybe we should
call it a night, huh?

24:10.850 --> 24:13.152
You saw
Captain Spaceman over there?

24:14.587 --> 24:16.489
I don't think we're gonna get
anything out of him.

24:20.092 --> 24:22.595
It's Crown.
Yeah.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.164
Yeah?
CROWN: We got results
on the bodies.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.432
Two are names you know:

24:26.465 --> 24:29.168
Belson and Drummond,
two of Harlow's first victims.

24:29.201 --> 24:33.139
The others are
in advanced decomp.
Whitman says 15 years.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.575
Wait, wait, wait.
Where was Harlow back then?

24:35.608 --> 24:36.976
That's the problem.

24:37.009 --> 24:41.347
Conrad Harlow was in ZÃ¼rich
from 2000 to 2005,

24:41.380 --> 24:43.249
at least according
to his passport.

24:43.282 --> 24:46.218
We need to see if he had
any known associates back then.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.820
Way ahead of you.

24:47.854 --> 24:50.890
Ericson tracked down
an old girlfriend of Harlow's
from grad school.

24:50.923 --> 24:54.160
She filed
a sexual assault charge
with campus police.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.828
It mentions two attackers.

24:55.862 --> 24:56.863
Any names?

24:57.730 --> 25:00.166
The file was buried by the DA.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.001
I'm going to interview
the girlfriend now.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.371
Okay.
We're waiting on Charles.

25:05.404 --> 25:06.906
TOMMY:
This is going to be fun.

25:06.939 --> 25:09.508
Actually, we're about to
visit with him.
Call you later.

25:12.278 --> 25:16.616
We wanted
to talk to you about the woman
who came to visit you today.

25:20.653 --> 25:21.921
Whoa, whoa, wait.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.322
It's okay.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.358
It's okay, Charles.
Hey, no problem. No problem.

25:26.392 --> 25:28.494
Hey, buddy.
Buddy, hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.296
Hey, sorry, buddy. Sorry.

25:31.397 --> 25:34.066
I came to talk
about your, uh, friend.

25:35.768 --> 25:36.636
Charles.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.170
Sounds like you two were close.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.140
We take care of each other.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.612
Did you, um...

25:48.815 --> 25:51.150
It's okay. It's okay.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.889
And you keep
each other's secrets?

25:58.190 --> 25:59.558
Sometimes.

25:59.592 --> 26:00.827
Yeah?
Yeah.

26:02.361 --> 26:03.763
I have a friend like that.

26:05.464 --> 26:07.266
A friend who I keep secrets for.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.069
What kind of secrets?

26:13.372 --> 26:14.841
Sometimes

26:16.242 --> 26:17.710
my friend isn't very nice.

26:20.079 --> 26:23.616
Sometimes she's...
She's kind of mean.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.319
My friend is kind of mean too.

26:28.921 --> 26:29.956
Yeah.

26:29.989 --> 26:30.890
To other people?

26:30.923 --> 26:33.760
Yeah.
Yeah

26:35.227 --> 26:36.295
Hey. It's okay.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.198
It's hard.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.870
It's hard

26:43.903 --> 26:46.773
when you care
about someone who's mean.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.175
Yeah.

26:52.511 --> 26:54.280
Did your friend ever get angry

26:55.047 --> 26:56.048
with Dr. Shen?

26:57.416 --> 26:59.185
We don't want
to talk about that.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.289
Did Dr. Shen hurt you?

27:03.322 --> 27:04.791
Yeah.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.059
Your friend?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.966
Did your friend
hurt Dr. Shen back?

27:16.903 --> 27:18.871
I'm not supposed to say.

27:21.974 --> 27:25.644
Maybe we can check on him,
make sure he's okay.

27:27.379 --> 27:31.150
I don't care if he's hurt,
he hurt us first.

27:31.183 --> 27:33.519
We should find him
and lock him up.

27:33.552 --> 27:35.621
Yeah. Yeah.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.757
Make sure he never hurts
anyone else again.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.126
He hurt so many...

27:41.093 --> 27:42.194
So many children.

27:47.199 --> 27:51.303
Was there candy in the air
when they got hurt?

27:55.441 --> 27:57.276
Emily said something
about that.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.578
Yeah, yeah.

27:59.611 --> 28:01.680
That's how Dr. Shen tricks you.

28:01.714 --> 28:04.416
The air is full of candy.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.087
And I tried to eat it.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.257
Then he lies,

28:11.290 --> 28:13.926
he always says you can have
the candy later,

28:13.960 --> 28:15.828
but there wasn't any candy.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.564
There was never any candy.
It's okay, Charles.

28:18.597 --> 28:20.099
It's okay. That's enough.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.501
Wait, wait, no...
No, that's enough.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.070
It's okay. It's okay.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.172
Thank you. Thank you.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.206
Come on.

28:31.677 --> 28:32.879
It's okay.

28:34.413 --> 28:35.447
It's okay.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.450
TOMMY:
What are you doing, man?

28:38.484 --> 28:39.852
He started to talk.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.420
I know, I know, I know,
but I think we got
what we needed.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.022
Do you remember
the molasses flood?

28:43.055 --> 28:44.991
That urban legend?
No, it's not an urban legend.

28:45.024 --> 28:47.393
A hundred years ago
a storage tank exploded,

28:47.426 --> 28:50.129
it flooded the North End with
two million gallons of molasses.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.864
The North End
doesn't smell like molasses.

28:51.898 --> 28:54.500
Not too much anymore.
But back in the 1990s

28:54.533 --> 28:57.804
when they ripped everything up
for the big dig, it did.

28:57.837 --> 29:01.073
After the explosion,
the factory turned
into a warehouse.

29:01.107 --> 29:04.210
Perfect for torturing kids.
Yeah, and holding my family.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.581
Hey, what did you find?

29:09.615 --> 29:11.483
LAURIE:
You know I could go to jail
for helping her like this?

29:11.517 --> 29:13.685
Yeah, don't worry,
you'll get your exclusive.

29:13.719 --> 29:15.454
What I found is
better than that.

29:15.487 --> 29:19.125
Look, Jack,
I do want that interview,
but I can't sit on this.

29:19.158 --> 29:22.561
I mean, I can give you
a half a day, maybe,
but then I publish.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.831
What do you mean,
sit on what, Laurie?

29:24.864 --> 29:26.298
What the hell did you find?

29:47.419 --> 29:48.921
Hey, you find anything?

29:48.955 --> 29:50.356
JACK: I did, but, Em...

29:50.389 --> 29:51.390
What?

29:53.792 --> 29:55.261
Just say it, Jack.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.864
Tri-King made the tank
seven years ago.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.731
They had it delivered
to the North End.

29:59.765 --> 30:00.833
Okay, where?

30:00.867 --> 30:03.569
978 Commercial Street,
suite 209.

30:03.602 --> 30:04.971
And who ordered it?

30:08.307 --> 30:09.475
Jack?

30:10.342 --> 30:11.443
You did, Em.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.146
It was you.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.816
No, that's not possible.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.318
I saw the invoice myself.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.020
You signed it.

30:21.453 --> 30:22.821
It's forged.

30:24.456 --> 30:25.958
I'm going there.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.826
And I'm going to find Flynn.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.233
Thank you.

30:39.872 --> 30:41.507
Some things
are better left in the past.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.844
There are lives at stake
in the present, Miss Wheelock.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.549
You never know
what might help.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.619
We were young people
experimenting.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.122
Things got out of hand.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.491
That's not what you put
in the report you filed.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.694
The Harlows
were a powerful family.

31:02.728 --> 31:04.030
Not anymore.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.198
You can talk to me.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.273
Conrad and I had broken up
the year before.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.475
It was amicable.

31:18.144 --> 31:19.878
Then we bumped into each other,

31:20.679 --> 31:22.081
made plans for a drink.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.351
We were back at his place.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.224
He had a friend join us...

31:34.526 --> 31:35.627
Then...

31:40.899 --> 31:42.201
I blacked out.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.404
It's only images.

31:48.274 --> 31:49.375
This friend...

31:50.342 --> 31:52.444
I need a name.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.247
Harlow may have had
an accomplice in his murders.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.950
He wasn't always some monster.

31:57.984 --> 32:00.119
Conrad I knew,
before that night,

32:02.621 --> 32:03.990
he was sensitive.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.292
He was in pain.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.228
Something hurt him.
What?

32:11.330 --> 32:12.364
He'd never say.

32:14.466 --> 32:15.567
Something in his family.

32:19.505 --> 32:22.508
I still need the name
of the other man
who assaulted you.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.046
Who said it was a man?

36:43.935 --> 36:45.203
It's a bum.

37:11.797 --> 37:12.798
There's nothing here.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.585
What?

37:39.991 --> 37:41.293
What is it?

37:44.029 --> 37:45.464
Nick?

37:46.064 --> 37:47.333
Durand!

37:56.442 --> 37:58.344
That's the mask Emily drew.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.447
No eyelids.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.882
The children Shen held in those
rooms would have seen this.

38:05.517 --> 38:06.785
It's not Harlow.

38:08.387 --> 38:09.788
The children
who saw these masks

38:09.821 --> 38:12.358
had the idea way before
Harlow ever got involved.

38:14.192 --> 38:15.427
Jesus.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.397
I've had it wrong
since the beginning.

38:19.398 --> 38:20.732
Since he called me that night.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.637
Emily is not
Harlow's accomplice.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.674
But she could be his mentor.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.422
Durand.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.157
I'm not far from the cabin.
I was sent here by
whoever has them.

40:59.190 --> 41:00.492
They're underground.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.896
Emily. Stay there.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.532
No, Nick, listen.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.466
Whoever planned this has eyes.

41:08.500 --> 41:11.002
If they see an army coming,
Flynn will die.

41:11.036 --> 41:12.470
Alice will die.

41:12.504 --> 41:14.706
I need you to come alone.

41:17.008 --> 41:18.744
You can cuff me after,
I don't care.

41:19.611 --> 41:20.946
You have my word.

41:21.412 --> 41:22.648
Okay.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.916
I'll come alone.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.052
Okay. I'm about 200 meters
north of the cabin.

41:27.085 --> 41:29.621
There's an open tunnel.
I'm leaving you
my scarf as a sign.
