the Butcher's second victim?

01:39.825 --> 01:42.434
-Wrong side of the tape, Ains.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.768
Most likely a man.

30s, maybe 40s,

-Unobtainable.

Yes. Rejection

"7-3" used to be, uh, "P-E."

28:11.715 --> 28:13.448

for "Pennsylvania Exchange"

alphanumerics.

32:15.643 --> 32:17.267
it's poison.

32:17.460 --> 32:20.520
But I'm not gonna
let it poison my life, too.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.168
And now we're done.

32:26.186 --> 32:28.570
(door opens)

32:37.906 --> 32:39.122
To what do I owe the pleasure?

32:39.291 --> 32:40.849
Miss Windsor, is my sister here?

32:40.909 --> 32:42.125
You should have called first.

32:42.318 --> 32:44.461
Miss Whitly is not here.
Good night.

32:45.247 --> 32:47.205
You're lying!

32:47.357 --> 32:50.450
-What gives you the right to...
-Etiquette.

32:50.511 --> 32:53.361
You turned your back on me,
a guest.

32:53.422 --> 32:56.456
Manners dictate a proper exit.

32:56.517 --> 33:00.218
You can show me the door firmly,
not dismissively.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.370
You'd only risk incivility

33:02.431 --> 33:05.040
to hide another break
in decorum.

33:05.100 --> 33:06.632
Lying.

33:06.694 --> 33:07.726
I'm not lying!

33:07.878 --> 33:09.394
A raised voice.

33:09.488 --> 33:13.156
And you used a contraction,
which is shocking given,

33:13.349 --> 33:15.066
you know, you.

33:15.202 --> 33:16.901
<i> AINSLEY:</i>
<i> I bet you have some stories.</i>

33:16.996 --> 33:19.830
Come on.
You've got the tea,

33:19.981 --> 33:20.831
I've got the time.

33:21.024 --> 33:22.815
Why don't you tell me a few?

33:22.876 --> 33:24.726
I'd rather show you.

33:24.745 --> 33:27.412
<i> WINDSOR:</i>
<i> Who are you to judge me?</i>

33:27.548 --> 33:29.898
I am perfectly within my right
to do whatever...

33:29.958 --> 33:33.659
The last victim received a call
from your private line.

33:33.721 --> 33:35.846
I never use that number.

33:35.997 --> 33:38.073
-What is it?
-Oh...

33:38.133 --> 33:39.924
Who are we looking for,
Miss Windsor?

33:40.019 --> 33:41.852
Sarah, is the killer here?

33:42.688 --> 33:45.981
Your sister's
up in the tea room. Go.

33:47.735 --> 33:50.235
Ainsley?!

33:50.863 --> 33:52.571
Ainsley!

34:00.205 --> 34:01.705
RACHEL:
I'm so excited to show you this.

34:01.856 --> 34:03.098
I'm saving the school.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.450
Calling alumni,
asking for donations.

34:05.544 --> 34:09.504
-Only the finest people.
-(groans softly)

34:12.000 --> 34:14.342
Ainsley?

34:15.721 --> 34:16.945
Oh.

34:17.005 --> 34:19.347
Ainsley.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.374
You look tired.

34:21.435 --> 34:24.302
What did you put in my tea?

34:24.454 --> 34:27.481
Oh, just something
to help you sleep.

34:28.925 --> 34:31.050
(clattering in distance)

34:31.111 --> 34:33.653
(muffled speaking)

34:36.024 --> 34:38.325
(latch clicks)

34:47.461 --> 34:50.736
RACHEL:
I won't let the banks
close the school.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.924
Take all of this
from Miss Windsor.

34:54.093 --> 34:56.468
-From us.
-(zipping)

35:00.599 --> 35:04.559
Don't worry.
You won't feel a thing.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.689
(phone vibrates)

35:14.822 --> 35:16.762
You should know...

35:16.865 --> 35:18.949
I have a gun!

35:42.141 --> 35:44.032
Good evening, ladies.

35:44.092 --> 35:47.385
One's deportment
tells us everything

35:47.521 --> 35:50.647
we need to know about a woman.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.724
Her family.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.986
Her intelligence.

35:56.179 --> 35:58.446
Her morals.

35:59.158 --> 36:01.065
Are they...

36:01.160 --> 36:02.975
a good person?

36:03.036 --> 36:05.453
One mistake...

36:06.481 --> 36:09.815
...can destroy everything.

36:09.877 --> 36:11.817
(glass breaks)

36:11.879 --> 36:13.503
(cries)

36:15.290 --> 36:18.341
But everybody makes mistakes.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.252
Not you.

36:21.388 --> 36:23.087
You have to be perfect.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.240
You're not supposed
to be in here.

36:25.300 --> 36:26.925
No man has ever been in here.

36:27.077 --> 36:29.352
I apologize.

36:30.397 --> 36:32.672
I'm here for Ainsley.

36:32.733 --> 36:35.483
Get-get out!

36:38.864 --> 36:40.104
The victim's names.

36:40.199 --> 36:43.033
You crossed them out.

36:43.702 --> 36:47.454
They betrayed everything
that this school stood for.

36:50.918 --> 36:53.335
Whose room is this, Rachel?

36:54.880 --> 36:57.589
The bed, the dolls.

37:03.055 --> 37:04.629
Who lives here?

37:04.781 --> 37:07.265
<i> WINDSOR:</i>
<i> But no one would take her.</i>

37:08.343 --> 37:11.019
What was I supposed to do?

37:12.722 --> 37:14.622
Please.

37:14.724 --> 37:16.691
Help me.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.886
Hide her.

37:20.989 --> 37:22.981
Keep her secret.

37:23.075 --> 37:25.617
No one can know the truth.

37:26.936 --> 37:30.372
You wicked, wicked girl!

37:34.086 --> 37:36.235
Miss Windsor's your mother.

37:36.296 --> 37:39.330
There are s... some things

37:39.424 --> 37:42.150
that people do not need to know.

37:42.252 --> 37:44.219
I'm not sure I agree.

37:45.922 --> 37:47.989
What if hiding the truth

37:48.049 --> 37:49.657
hurts people?

37:49.676 --> 37:52.102
Turns a person
into something they are not?

37:52.295 --> 37:54.086
Oh, Sarah...

37:54.189 --> 37:57.274
-how could you?
-(hissing)

37:58.968 --> 38:00.852
The wrong sort of man,

38:00.946 --> 38:03.187
letting him do that to you.

38:03.282 --> 38:05.840
No, she gave me a home.

38:05.900 --> 38:07.284
She loved me.

38:07.452 --> 38:09.435
But never like the other girls.

38:10.455 --> 38:13.939
So you directed your rage
towards Violet,

38:14.001 --> 38:16.626
Trina, Allison.

38:16.819 --> 38:19.354
These women that
rejected the love

38:19.414 --> 38:21.464
that you craved so much.

38:22.917 --> 38:24.467
And Ainsley.

38:28.423 --> 38:30.790
She was going
to expose the truth.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.792
My mother

38:32.853 --> 38:35.270
called me her secret angel.

38:36.431 --> 38:38.723
No one can ever know the truth.

38:38.817 --> 38:41.133
Rachel, the gun

38:41.194 --> 38:43.135
is not like the debreather.

38:43.196 --> 38:46.397
It's brutal, violent.

38:46.550 --> 38:48.900
D-Don't worry. I'm gonna
make your sister beautiful.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.453
Wait.

38:52.205 --> 38:54.122
Don't do this.

38:55.158 --> 38:57.483
There has to be another way.

38:57.586 --> 38:58.960
Ainsley!

-Yeah.

39:11.558 --> 39:13.850

-I'm sorry, Rachel,

39:14.019 --> 39:16.353
but they can never know.

39:24.312 --> 39:25.587
-I smell gas.
-What?

39:25.688 --> 39:28.773

40:53.952 --> 40:57.178
Ah.
New nail polish.

40:57.197 --> 40:59.438
It changes color
when your drink's been roofied.

40:59.499 --> 41:02.292
I figured Rachel would
get a little suspicious

41:02.485 --> 41:05.778
if I didn't at least
act a little drowsy, so...

41:05.797 --> 41:09.023
I guess this means
I kind of won, huh?

41:09.134 --> 41:11.718
Like, I solved the case first?

41:13.305 --> 41:15.972
What?
Why are you looking at me

41:16.165 --> 41:17.882
like I'm The Debutante Slayer?

41:18.034 --> 41:20.218
-It's not that.
-Exactly.

41:20.312 --> 41:23.204
I'm the kick-ass reporter
who stopped the killer.

41:23.264 --> 41:26.149
With your help, of course.
(short chuckle)

41:26.300 --> 41:28.042
You put yourself in danger.

41:28.102 --> 41:30.820
But I had to figure it out.

41:30.989 --> 41:33.806
Not who did it, but...

41:33.867 --> 41:35.241
Why she did it.

41:36.277 --> 41:39.120
Yeah.
I get that.

41:40.657 --> 41:44.501
My father was a serial killer
also, Malcolm.

41:44.694 --> 41:46.318
I was young, but

41:46.338 --> 41:48.588
I have a right
to be messed up, too.

41:51.343 --> 41:54.085
MARTIN:
The Debutante Slayer nabbed.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.995
Bravo, Malcolm!

41:56.056 --> 41:59.349
And Ainsley has an exclusive.
(laughs)

41:59.500 --> 42:01.851
I'm not ashamed to admit it:
I'm a proud papa.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.261
This is a disaster.

42:03.413 --> 42:06.080
Oh.
Enjoy the win, Jess.

42:06.140 --> 42:08.024
-(sighs)
-You got to learn how

42:08.193 --> 42:10.418
to suck the marrow out of life.

42:10.478 --> 42:13.530
Mm.
You were right.

42:13.723 --> 42:15.848
I can't take her away.
She's too unstable.

42:15.867 --> 42:18.183
Maybe even more so than Malcolm,
if that's possible.

42:18.286 --> 42:21.704
-Oh, it's entirely...
-Don't say another word.

42:23.524 --> 42:25.708
Just for a second,
be the man that I married

42:25.901 --> 42:28.193
all those years ago,
not this monster.

42:28.255 --> 42:32.364
Just for a second, be him.

42:33.260 --> 42:36.386
We're going
to lose them, Martin.

42:36.579 --> 42:39.330
They'll be arrested,
devoured by the media,

42:39.391 --> 42:41.724
imprisoned, or worse.

42:41.917 --> 42:44.060
What do you need from me?

42:45.013 --> 42:46.688
A partner.

42:53.738 --> 42:54.887
Of course.

42:54.990 --> 42:56.981
And we will.

Even these chains can't stop me.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.321
Nope.
