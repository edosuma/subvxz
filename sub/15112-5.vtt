00:19.466 --> 00:20.583
Slow down, damn you!

00:20.617 --> 00:23.086
You're scaring my dog!

00:23.120 --> 00:26.256
Quit texting
and learn to drive, a-hole!

00:26.290 --> 00:28.258
You hit me, douchebag!

00:28.292 --> 00:29.259
Ouch.
You punk!

00:29.293 --> 00:31.294
Rapture kit, ten bucks.

00:32.897 --> 00:34.230
I'll wing it.

00:34.265 --> 00:36.432
How about a buck?

00:36.466 --> 00:37.684
Wait...
Tire iron!

00:37.735 --> 00:40.303
- Okay.
- Stupid city.

00:41.772 --> 00:43.273
They have
an incredible law library.

00:43.307 --> 00:45.108
I love all the faculty I've met.

00:45.142 --> 00:46.993
And I'm telling you,
Oregon's amazing!

00:47.027 --> 00:48.862
It's, like, 70 degrees,

00:48.913 --> 00:51.030
sunny... you're not gonna
win a weather war, sweetie.

00:51.081 --> 00:53.149
It's 70 degrees and sunny
every day here in L.A.

00:53.167 --> 00:54.200
<i>Yeah, no, no.</i>

00:54.251 --> 00:55.618
But when I tell you
it's beautiful,

00:55.652 --> 00:57.086
it's, like, seriously beautiful.

00:57.121 --> 00:59.655
I mean, you can
actually see mountains,

00:59.673 --> 01:03.092
and the sky's blue,
not some brown or gray.

01:03.127 --> 01:04.260
And the trees...

01:04.295 --> 01:05.461
The trees are incredible.

01:05.495 --> 01:07.496
Come on, we...

01:07.514 --> 01:09.165
We have trees.

01:09.183 --> 01:10.833
It's not, like, a contest.

01:10.851 --> 01:13.720
I'm just saying
it's really nice.

01:13.771 --> 01:15.722
Yeah, the grass
is always greener.

01:15.773 --> 01:17.023
Yeah, well, I'm telling you,

01:17.057 --> 01:19.976
the grass actually
greener here.

01:22.846 --> 01:24.697
What the hell's
going on?

01:24.732 --> 01:27.350
It says they've got,
like, three blocks closed.

01:27.368 --> 01:28.818
What for?

01:28.852 --> 01:30.737
They're
filming something.

01:30.788 --> 01:33.573
Maybe we should
take the freeway.

01:33.624 --> 01:35.491
It says the freeway's worse.

01:35.525 --> 01:39.913
How can it be worse
than not moving?

01:39.964 --> 01:42.415
Maybe you go backwards.

01:46.971 --> 01:48.671
Captain wants
to know why we

01:48.705 --> 01:50.423
don't have any suspects
in those cases.

01:50.474 --> 01:53.343
'Cause my psychic powers
are failing me.

01:53.377 --> 01:54.811
Maybe we should take out
a billboard:

01:54.845 --> 01:57.597
"Stop killing each other till we
catch up, signed... the police."

01:57.648 --> 01:59.182
"Leave more evidence."

01:59.216 --> 02:01.384
You
want to grab a bite?

02:02.719 --> 02:05.554
No. I think I'm gonna
head up to the park.

02:05.572 --> 02:06.606
The park?

02:06.657 --> 02:07.657
- Yeah.
- What for?

02:07.691 --> 02:09.609
- Go for a run.
- A run?

02:09.660 --> 02:12.111
Yeah. I want to look
at something beautiful.

02:12.162 --> 02:13.663
We got views
in this city, right?

02:13.697 --> 02:14.747
That's why we live here.

02:14.782 --> 02:15.898
Hell if I know.

02:29.513 --> 02:31.580
Not bad.

03:08.469 --> 03:10.920
This stupid city.

03:10.954 --> 03:12.621
<i>So tell me how this works.</i>

03:12.639 --> 03:15.008
<i>I'm awake with my wife,</i>
<i>and I close my eyes.</i>

03:15.059 --> 03:16.242
<i>I open them.</i>

03:16.276 --> 03:17.593
<i>I'm awake with my son.</i>

03:17.628 --> 03:20.096
And this has been happening
since the accident?

03:21.765 --> 03:25.151
<i>So you begin working</i>
<i>on one case here in reality,</i>

03:25.185 --> 03:27.854
<i>and then, suddenly,</i>
<i>you begin working another case</i>

03:27.905 --> 03:29.805
<i>there in your dream.</i>

03:29.823 --> 03:32.025
<i>It all feels</i>
<i>completely real to me.</i>

03:32.076 --> 03:34.110
You can't tell whether
you're awake or asleep

03:34.144 --> 03:35.211
at this very moment?

03:35.245 --> 03:36.279
<i>Well, I can assure you,</i>

03:36.313 --> 03:38.147
Detective Britten,
this is not a dream.

03:38.165 --> 03:40.783
That's exactly what
the other shrink said.

03:41.884 --> 03:43.704
AWAKE
S01 Ep05 - Oregon

03:44.278 --> 03:47.778
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

03:47.873 --> 03:48.993
These're all of them?

03:48.999 --> 03:50.250
1999 to last year.

03:50.636 --> 03:52.470
Every one gets a vertical
slash down the wrist.

03:52.488 --> 03:53.642
After they bleed out,

03:53.643 --> 03:56.775
a postmortem Roman numeral
two carved into their torso.

03:57.449 --> 04:00.334
You got all pairs...
Two in Minneapolis,

04:00.385 --> 04:02.286
Nashville, Buffalo,
Philadelphia,

04:02.304 --> 04:04.338
Lincoln, Ann Harbor,
Dallas,

04:04.389 --> 04:07.675
and then, year later,
L.A. Last night.

04:07.726 --> 04:10.311
Vic disappeared
yesterday.

04:10.345 --> 04:13.013
We got no witness, nothing
from forensics yet.

04:13.065 --> 04:15.299
If you ignore the
fact Gemini is dead,

04:15.317 --> 04:18.135
this fits his
pattern to a tee.

04:18.153 --> 04:20.353
So, what, either he's
been resurrected

04:20.404 --> 04:22.473
and is leaving bodies
in Griffith Park

04:22.491 --> 04:25.192
or someone found his work
inspirational enough to copy.

04:25.243 --> 04:26.911
You know, the Gemini
always killed

04:26.945 --> 04:28.645
his second victim
within 48 hours

04:28.663 --> 04:30.030
and left it
in a paired location.

04:30.082 --> 04:31.432
Two cars in Nashville,

04:31.466 --> 04:32.750
two bathrooms in Dallas.

04:32.784 --> 04:34.651
So this victim
turns up in a park.

04:34.669 --> 04:36.287
If the copycat's
as good as he looks,

04:36.321 --> 04:38.205
there'll be another one
in another park.

04:38.256 --> 04:41.592
Well, there's what, 70,000
acres of parkland in L.A.?

04:41.626 --> 04:44.828
Are you suggesting that
we shut it all down?

04:44.846 --> 04:46.013
Well, we got to
do something.

04:46.047 --> 04:47.831
Maybe beef up patrols
the next couple of days,

04:47.849 --> 04:50.167
put K9 units
on the entrances and exits.

04:50.185 --> 04:51.502
Done. Who's getting the Fed?

04:51.520 --> 04:53.270
Why are they sending someone?

04:53.305 --> 04:55.139
I asked for forensics
on the previous cases.

04:55.173 --> 04:57.892
FBI told me an agent
would be on the next plane.

04:57.943 --> 04:59.843
Ask for an e-mail,
they book a plane ticket.

04:59.861 --> 05:01.345
Got to love the government.

05:01.363 --> 05:02.897
Who do you work
for, Google?

05:02.948 --> 05:05.950
<i>Look, I'm just asking you</i>
<i>to help me out.</i>

05:05.984 --> 05:07.985
She's my daughter, too.

05:08.019 --> 05:10.037
What do you
want me to do, Elizabeth?

05:10.071 --> 05:11.205
Bribe her?

05:11.239 --> 05:13.207
I can't force her
to get on the phone.

05:13.241 --> 05:14.992
Did she at least
get the package?

05:15.026 --> 05:16.710
Why do you do this to yourself?

05:16.745 --> 05:19.630
You know she's trying
to hurt you.

05:19.664 --> 05:21.165
I got to go.

05:21.199 --> 05:23.367
I'll call you back.

05:23.385 --> 05:25.920
Divorce sucks.

05:27.973 --> 05:29.089
You are Detective Britten,
right?

05:29.141 --> 05:31.425
- Yeah.
- Elizabeth Santoro.

05:31.476 --> 05:32.810
Good to meet you.

05:32.844 --> 05:34.311
Did you bring the case file?

05:34.346 --> 05:35.813
Yeah. It's in the car.

05:35.847 --> 05:37.598
<i>Shall we?</i>

05:39.017 --> 05:41.051
As copycats go,
your guy's pretty good.

05:42.604 --> 05:44.939
You're positive it's a copycat?

05:45.991 --> 05:47.441
Am I positive?

05:47.492 --> 05:49.393
Just asking.

05:49.411 --> 05:51.362
How many cases
have you had

05:51.396 --> 05:53.063
in the last 12 years,
Detective Britten?

05:54.416 --> 05:56.500
I don't know... hundreds.

05:56.535 --> 05:58.252
Well, I've had one.

05:58.286 --> 05:59.870
The Gemini killer.

06:01.339 --> 06:03.791
You know what they give you
after 12 years on one case?

06:03.842 --> 06:05.242
- No.
- Book deal.

06:06.511 --> 06:07.761
So, ever since last may,

06:07.796 --> 06:09.580
I've been sitting
in a cabin in Portland

06:09.598 --> 06:12.416
trying to get the last
12 years down on paper,

06:12.434 --> 06:13.851
hoping that when
the hardcover comes out,

06:13.885 --> 06:15.519
it'll seem worth it.

06:15.554 --> 06:17.771
The short and soon-to-be
declassified answer

06:17.806 --> 06:19.139
will be on page 27

06:19.191 --> 06:21.025
if anybody ever reads
the stupid book.

06:21.059 --> 06:22.359
Which is?

06:22.394 --> 06:24.094
No two-dollar bill.

06:24.112 --> 06:26.530
Two-dollar bill?

06:26.565 --> 06:27.815
Gemini always left
a two-dollar bill

06:27.866 --> 06:28.932
in the hand of his victims.

06:28.950 --> 06:29.933
You know, two...

06:29.951 --> 06:31.068
Gemini twin sign.

06:31.102 --> 06:32.653
We kept it
from the press

06:32.704 --> 06:34.121
to separate imitators
and false confessors

06:34.155 --> 06:35.573
from the real thing.

06:35.607 --> 06:37.491
Did you guys find
a two-dollar bill

06:37.542 --> 06:39.243
I don't know about?

06:39.277 --> 06:40.995
No.

06:41.046 --> 06:42.463
There you go.

06:42.497 --> 06:43.831
Copycat.

06:43.882 --> 06:46.333
That's the other
unfortunate consequence

06:46.384 --> 06:49.086
of spending 12 years
on one particular sicko.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.888
You're the person
they get out of bed

06:50.922 --> 06:53.207
every time
another one turns up.

06:53.241 --> 06:55.743
Still, it gets me out
of Portland for a while.

06:55.777 --> 06:57.761
I hear it's nice up there.

06:57.795 --> 06:59.146
Who told you that?

06:59.180 --> 07:00.898
All it ever does
is rain.

07:00.932 --> 07:03.067
Imagine London,
but full of hippies.

07:03.101 --> 07:04.301
You coming in?

07:04.319 --> 07:06.237
I have something
to sort out.

07:06.271 --> 07:08.272
I'll see you up there.

07:13.328 --> 07:14.945
<i>So did you meet Santoro?</i>

07:14.979 --> 07:16.313
Meet her?

07:16.348 --> 07:17.665
She's not there
ten minutes,

07:17.699 --> 07:18.866
and she's already
telling us

07:18.917 --> 07:20.501
we're looking for
a disgruntled white dude,

07:20.535 --> 07:22.269
middle to lower
middle class.

07:22.304 --> 07:23.704
Based on what exactly?

07:23.755 --> 07:24.955
She don't say.

07:24.989 --> 07:26.707
These
profilers, man,

07:26.758 --> 07:28.676
they're just a cut
below psychics.

07:28.710 --> 07:30.794
They make these broad
generalizations

07:30.828 --> 07:33.547
that apply to almost anybody,
then congratulate themselves

07:33.598 --> 07:35.299
for being right
no matter what turns up.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.217
I had no idea it was
such a sore point for you.

07:37.269 --> 07:38.335
Well, let's
just say

07:38.353 --> 07:39.670
I've been accidentally
pulled over

07:39.688 --> 07:41.305
enough to know
that there's a difference

07:41.339 --> 07:43.006
between a profile and a suspect.

07:43.024 --> 07:44.775
Is this it?

07:44.809 --> 07:46.026
- This it right here?
- No, no.

07:46.061 --> 07:47.895
Browner, pointier.

07:47.946 --> 07:49.346
Muttier.

07:49.364 --> 07:51.682
Look, I'm just saying

07:51.700 --> 07:55.119
real cops don't sit back

07:55.153 --> 07:58.122
and theorize
about whether a suspect

07:58.156 --> 08:00.691
likes bingo
or eats cornflakes.

08:00.709 --> 08:02.126
I mean, we pound
the pavement.

08:03.161 --> 08:05.045
We work the
dog biscuits, baby.

08:08.633 --> 08:10.250
Here, boy.
Here, boy.

08:10.302 --> 08:11.585
Here's a good boy.

08:11.636 --> 08:13.220
Tasty.

08:13.254 --> 08:14.871
Come on. Come to daddy.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.761
You guys should keep him
after the sedation wears off.

08:20.812 --> 08:22.096
Help cheer this place up.

08:22.147 --> 08:23.430
Yeah, morgue mascot.

08:23.481 --> 08:24.515
Just what we need.

08:24.549 --> 08:25.566
You know, this
little jerk

08:25.600 --> 08:26.934
tried to bite my
finger off earlier.

08:26.985 --> 08:28.268
You know,
gastric lavage

08:28.320 --> 08:31.155
on an anesthetized dog...
Not my job.

08:31.189 --> 08:32.856
- I owe you one.
- Yeah, you do.

08:32.890 --> 08:34.024
That said...

08:34.058 --> 08:34.966
American currency

08:34.967 --> 08:37.745
has plastic security threads
woven into the paper.

08:37.779 --> 08:39.163
Makes them hard to digest.

08:39.197 --> 08:41.999
It's a little ragged, but...

08:42.033 --> 08:43.866
There's no question...

08:43.900 --> 08:46.203
That's a two-
dollar bill.

08:47.922 --> 08:50.073
This does not
mean it's the Gemini.

08:50.091 --> 08:52.543
It just means the copycat
is someone who had access

08:52.577 --> 08:55.129
to classified information
about the case.

08:55.180 --> 08:57.047
If anything, it helps us
narrow our profile

08:57.081 --> 08:58.282
to someone who's probably in

08:58.316 --> 08:59.916
or was let go
from law enforcement.

08:59.934 --> 09:02.720
Can we get records
of any LAPD recently fired,

09:02.754 --> 09:03.971
demoted or laid off?

09:04.005 --> 09:05.305
And anybody with
a psychiatric history.

09:05.357 --> 09:07.358
We'll go through them,
start a canvass asap.

09:07.392 --> 09:09.560
Maybe somebody connects
back to our victim.

09:09.594 --> 09:10.778
Sound good?

09:10.812 --> 09:13.931
Look, look, what if it
were the Gemini killer?

09:13.965 --> 09:15.566
The Gemini killer is dead,
Detective.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.784
I shot him myself.

09:16.818 --> 09:18.402
Actually, a man named
Arthur Minturn is dead.

09:18.436 --> 09:20.690
Now, you're saying he's the Gemini
because he fits the profile.

09:20.691 --> 09:22.239
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

09:22.273 --> 09:23.498
I'm saying, if you
happened to be wrong,

09:23.499 --> 09:25.409
then we'd be wasting our time
interviewing recently fired cops,

09:25.443 --> 09:27.277
when we should be
looking for a guy

09:27.295 --> 09:29.329
who's been at this for
more than a decade.

09:29.381 --> 09:30.881
Your call, captain.

09:30.915 --> 09:32.399
I'm just here to consult.

09:35.336 --> 09:37.337
All right,
pull the files.

09:39.724 --> 09:41.225
Yes, ma'am.

09:43.928 --> 09:45.229
Agent.

09:45.263 --> 09:47.264
Agent Santoro.

09:48.316 --> 09:50.651
Look, all
Bird's asking

09:50.685 --> 09:53.320
is if there is value in
at least considering

09:53.354 --> 09:55.522
the possibility that
it's not a copycat.

09:55.573 --> 09:58.141
I had no trouble
parsing what he was saying.

09:58.159 --> 10:00.077
Maybe you had trouble
with my answer.

10:03.314 --> 10:06.583
Look, I understand
the implications.

10:06.618 --> 10:08.318
Honestly.

10:08.336 --> 10:11.839
I... I put an innocent man
in jail for ten years...

10:11.873 --> 10:13.323
Something I have
to live with.

10:13.341 --> 10:15.042
Mistakes happen.

10:15.093 --> 10:17.428
It's part of the job.

10:18.847 --> 10:21.598
I'm sorry you made
a huge mistake, Detective.

10:21.633 --> 10:23.300
I'm sorry
if that mistake

10:23.334 --> 10:24.601
probably ruined
someone's life.

10:24.636 --> 10:26.937
I'm-I'm sorry if it still
keeps you up at night.

10:26.971 --> 10:28.906
But I'm here to prevent
another victim

10:28.940 --> 10:30.557
from appearing
on your board tomorrow.

10:30.608 --> 10:32.893
Good night.

11:24.957 --> 11:25.848
<i>Hi, this is Hannah Britten,</i>

11:25.849 --> 11:27.905
<i>leave a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.</i>

11:28.957 --> 11:30.324
Honey, it's me.

11:30.358 --> 11:33.428
Listen, I can't find
my phone charger,

11:33.462 --> 11:38.149
so if you have any idea
where it is, could you call me?

11:38.183 --> 11:41.002
Even if you don't,
you can still call me.

12:07.395 --> 12:09.864
You're saying you feel lied to?

12:09.898 --> 12:12.942
No, I'm saying that apparently the
people at Mountain Top Movers

12:12.943 --> 12:15.236
knew she was more serious
about this than I did.

12:15.254 --> 12:17.404
How did she give you the
impression she wasn't serious?

12:18.540 --> 12:19.624
Look, we talked about it.

12:19.675 --> 12:22.093
W-we... she's just visiting.

12:22.127 --> 12:23.294
It's not a realistic option.

12:23.345 --> 12:24.912
Is that what she's been saying,

12:24.930 --> 12:26.514
or is that
what you've been hearing?

12:30.185 --> 12:32.637
Confirmation bias makes us
susceptible to hearing

12:32.688 --> 12:35.256
only things that reinforce
our opinion,

12:35.274 --> 12:38.860
and the more closely held
our opinion, the more selective

12:38.894 --> 12:40.511
we seem to be
about the things

12:40.546 --> 12:42.730
that we pay attention to.

12:42.764 --> 12:43.848
I think I know
what we've discussed.

12:43.882 --> 12:45.533
She never mentioned
calling the movers.

12:45.567 --> 12:46.868
Trust me.

12:49.775 --> 12:52.193
Can we just try something
just for a minute?

12:53.245 --> 12:55.077
I want you to try to think about

12:55.078 --> 12:57.481
how Hannah would
describe her situation.

12:57.499 --> 12:58.750
Come on, I'm not
going to role-play.

12:58.784 --> 13:01.442
No, you don't have <i>be</i> Hannah <i>per se</i>,

13:01.443 --> 13:04.321
but I just want you to try to imagine

13:04.340 --> 13:05.456
where she is right now

13:05.490 --> 13:08.259
and see
if you can articulate

13:08.293 --> 13:10.494
how she would describe things
from her point of view.

13:12.631 --> 13:14.165
Close your eyes.

13:14.183 --> 13:15.299
You're kidding me.

13:15.333 --> 13:18.052
Please.

13:25.728 --> 13:28.146
Fine.

13:28.180 --> 13:29.397
What do you
want to know?

13:29.431 --> 13:31.783
Tell me what it's like
where Hannah is.

13:31.817 --> 13:33.184
It's Oregon.

13:33.202 --> 13:36.320
It's, uh... it's pretty.

13:36.354 --> 13:37.354
Mountains, whatever.

13:37.373 --> 13:39.907
Do you imagine
that Hannah seems happy?

13:39.958 --> 13:42.577
Happy?

13:43.796 --> 13:47.131
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

13:47.166 --> 13:48.750
<i>And why do you think that is?</i>

13:48.801 --> 13:50.668
<i>Because she likes</i>
<i>the idea of starting over.</i>

13:50.702 --> 13:53.254
<i>And why is that so appealing?</i>

13:53.305 --> 13:56.307
Because it's easier
than staying here

13:56.341 --> 13:57.308
and dealing with everything.

13:57.342 --> 13:59.644
No, no,
that is what you would say.

13:59.678 --> 14:02.814
What would
Hannah say?

14:06.151 --> 14:08.102
<i>I guess she...</i>

14:08.153 --> 14:11.689
<i>She would like things</i>

14:11.723 --> 14:13.691
<i>to be good again.</i>

14:13.726 --> 14:17.061
And what does
that mean?

14:17.079 --> 14:18.246
I don't know.

14:18.280 --> 14:19.497
Okay, let me put it this way:

14:19.531 --> 14:22.500
When Hannah imagines
things being good again...

14:22.534 --> 14:24.535
Are you a part of it?

14:27.372 --> 14:29.340
What do you mean by that?

14:29.374 --> 14:30.792
I guess I'm wondering
if your fear

14:30.843 --> 14:34.028
is less about the idea
of Hannah leaving Los Angeles

14:34.062 --> 14:38.299
and more about the idea
of Hannah leaving you.

14:39.968 --> 14:41.936
That's way off.

14:41.970 --> 14:42.937
You said that,

14:42.971 --> 14:44.439
even before the accident,

14:44.473 --> 14:46.924
things were less than ideal
between the two of you.

14:46.942 --> 14:48.893
We have discussed
the very real fact

14:48.927 --> 14:50.111
that a large number
of marriages

14:50.145 --> 14:52.146
don't survive
the loss of a child,

14:52.197 --> 14:54.899
and yet you pretend that
the idea of your relationship

14:54.933 --> 14:57.535
being in jeopardy
doesn't even occur to you.

14:57.569 --> 14:58.953
It doesn't have to occur
to me, does it?

14:58.987 --> 15:01.005
I got you to point out that
my marriage is falling apart.

15:01.039 --> 15:02.406
Unfortunately,
Detective,

15:02.440 --> 15:05.526
the reality is that this is
the way most marriages die...

15:05.561 --> 15:09.180
Not with epic rounds
of screaming matches,

15:09.214 --> 15:11.916
not with threats
or ultimatums, but

15:11.950 --> 15:16.137
<i>with two people who wander</i>
<i>slowly away from one another</i>

15:16.171 --> 15:18.055
<i>without a word.</i>

15:18.090 --> 15:19.674
<i>They completely forget</i>
<i>what it really means</i>

15:19.725 --> 15:22.643
<i>to be together until one day,</i>

15:22.678 --> 15:25.396
<i>they look up and they discover</i>
<i>they're so far apart...</i>

15:28.633 --> 15:31.235
<i>...there's no way back.</i>

15:39.945 --> 15:42.830
I may have a lead on
that hancock ark home invasion.

15:42.865 --> 15:45.032
I'm meeting with some guy
who says he knows the fence.

15:45.083 --> 15:48.586
I wouldn't mind a second
opinion, see if he's for real,

15:48.620 --> 15:49.987
unless you're busy.

15:50.005 --> 15:52.156
No, I'm good.

15:53.158 --> 15:55.459
Oregon?

15:55.493 --> 15:57.295
What the hell are you going
to do in Oregon?

16:01.333 --> 16:04.001
I don't think
I could ever leave L.A.

16:04.019 --> 16:05.970
L.A. is perfect.

16:06.004 --> 16:08.139
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:08.173 --> 16:10.007
I went out with an actress
the other day

16:10.025 --> 16:12.176
who asked me to help her
memorize lines.

16:12.194 --> 16:15.279
She said the only way that
she could get into the part

16:15.314 --> 16:17.031
was to strip away everything

16:17.065 --> 16:20.351
that wasn't part of the
character, so she gets naked

16:20.369 --> 16:23.070
and reads a script to me
for an hour and a half.

16:23.121 --> 16:24.989
I mean, you cannot find that
in Oregon.

16:25.023 --> 16:26.958
She read to you?

16:26.992 --> 16:28.209
Naked.

16:28.243 --> 16:31.212
You and I have different
definitions of "perfect."

16:32.247 --> 16:33.714
Wait, hold on.

16:33.749 --> 16:36.500
Hold on, hold on,
here it is.

16:39.704 --> 16:41.806
I don't understand.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.040
It's supposed
to be here.

16:43.058 --> 16:45.560
My informant said
it was a pawnshop.

16:47.012 --> 16:48.229
Who introduced
you to this CI?

16:48.263 --> 16:49.247
Nobody.

16:49.281 --> 16:50.398
I was on a follow-up.

16:50.432 --> 16:52.216
He came right up and said
he might know something.

16:52.234 --> 16:53.351
He came up to you?

16:53.385 --> 16:54.352
Yeah, he...

16:54.386 --> 16:55.336
Well, for a hundred bucks,

16:55.370 --> 16:57.021
he said he'd tell me
where it was.

16:57.055 --> 16:59.357
What?

16:59.391 --> 17:01.192
Wait.

17:01.226 --> 17:03.911
- What, why'd you do that?
- You just learned a $100 lesson.

17:03.946 --> 17:06.414
If you have to buy it,
it may be information.

17:06.448 --> 17:08.031
If they're trying
to sell it to you,

17:08.066 --> 17:09.584
it's always BS.

17:11.619 --> 17:13.871
I don't suppose the department
is going to help me out

17:13.905 --> 17:15.423
with that 100 bucks.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.876
Think of it as
a rookie tax.

17:44.069 --> 17:46.037
<i>Hi, this is Hannah Britten.</i>

17:46.071 --> 17:48.939
<i>Leave a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.</i>

18:04.056 --> 18:06.007
The Mudflap Inn?

18:06.058 --> 18:08.009
Forensics from Gemini's
other cases suggest

18:08.060 --> 18:09.760
he liked to
set up a base

18:09.794 --> 18:11.729
within a two-mile radius
of the first kill,

18:11.763 --> 18:13.797
get to know
the area.

18:13.815 --> 18:15.433
Cheap motels with
classy names.

18:15.467 --> 18:17.268
The sort of place
nobody asks questions

18:17.302 --> 18:19.136
if you walk in
with blood on your shirt.

18:19.154 --> 18:20.604
Exactly.

18:20.638 --> 18:22.657
These are all within a couple
miles of Griffith Park.

18:22.691 --> 18:24.241
I figure, we divide
and conquer,

18:24.276 --> 18:25.860
should take us
a couple hours.

18:25.911 --> 18:27.495
We'll ask the questions
Santoro doesn't want to,

18:27.529 --> 18:28.812
and if it
doesn't work out,

18:28.830 --> 18:30.364
we'll go do the
disgruntled cop interviews,

18:30.415 --> 18:32.416
she'll be none
the wiser.

18:40.876 --> 18:44.328
<i>Hello, Dr. Dave.</i>

18:44.346 --> 18:46.380
Excuse me.

18:46.431 --> 18:47.498
Yeah.

18:47.516 --> 18:48.499
Sir.

18:54.339 --> 18:56.273
Good morning.

18:56.308 --> 18:58.008
Start again?

18:58.026 --> 19:00.194
I'm looking for a man who
checked in over the last week...

19:00.228 --> 19:02.780
Alone, would have kept
himself to himself,

19:02.814 --> 19:04.365
paid cash.

19:04.399 --> 19:06.350
You just described pretty
much everyone here.

19:06.368 --> 19:07.485
All right, well,
let's start

19:07.519 --> 19:08.903
last Wednesday
and move forward.

19:08.954 --> 19:10.788
Would have stayed a couple
nights, maybe still here.

19:10.822 --> 19:12.456
That I would remember.

19:12.491 --> 19:16.327
See, we deal pretty
exclusively in hourly guests.

19:16.361 --> 19:18.713
Yeah, okay.

19:18.747 --> 19:19.964
Enjoy the movie.

20:27.899 --> 20:29.900
LAPD!

20:29.934 --> 20:31.535
Show me
your hands.

20:31.570 --> 20:33.270
Show me your hands!

20:33.288 --> 20:35.573
Stop!

21:14.580 --> 21:17.180
We've got these
at the bottom of sleeping-bag.

21:17.199 --> 21:18.900
We probably won't get
any prints.

21:18.934 --> 21:20.284
And what about
the rest of the room?

21:20.319 --> 21:22.370
Well, it's
an abandoned building.

21:22.404 --> 21:24.205
It's covered
in a hundred different sets

21:24.239 --> 21:26.741
of hairs,
prints, fibers.

21:26.775 --> 21:28.275
We'll run what we get,
but there's no good way

21:28.293 --> 21:30.861
to separate wheat
from chaff.

21:35.667 --> 21:38.586
I'm sorry. What were
you doing in here again?

21:41.089 --> 21:43.257
Based on the old cases,
we were checking out motels

21:43.291 --> 21:44.809
within a two-mile radius
of the first murder,

21:44.843 --> 21:46.293
seeing if anything popped.

21:46.311 --> 21:48.262
Yeah, but this isn't
a motel, so...

21:48.296 --> 21:50.147
Well, no,

21:50.182 --> 21:52.266
but it's opposite one,
and I saw this building,

21:52.300 --> 21:54.635
looked like the kind of place
somebody might make camp...

21:54.670 --> 21:56.487
Well, there are
probably six abandoned buildings

21:56.521 --> 21:59.139
on this street alone,
not to mention all the buildings

21:59.157 --> 22:00.841
across from the motels
you checked out,

22:00.876 --> 22:03.477
any one of which someone
could have camped out in.

22:04.696 --> 22:07.281
I'm just trying
to understand

22:07.316 --> 22:09.834
what specifically
brought you in here.

22:09.868 --> 22:12.420
Does it matter?
This is where the guy was.

22:14.006 --> 22:16.173
There were signs
of a forced entry.

22:16.208 --> 22:18.175
Lucky you were looking out
for that kind of thing.

22:18.210 --> 22:19.677
No, if I was lucky,
I would have caught the guy.

22:19.711 --> 22:21.328
And you never saw the suspect
at all?

22:21.346 --> 22:22.496
Is that right, Detective Bird?

22:22.514 --> 22:25.499
I was at another motel.

22:25.517 --> 22:28.686
How did you guys decide
who'd take which motels?

22:28.720 --> 22:30.504
Well, we tore a piece
of paper in half.

22:30.522 --> 22:31.605
You did?

22:31.640 --> 22:32.840
We did.

22:32.858 --> 22:35.009
I did.
What's your point?

22:35.027 --> 22:36.277
I just want to make sure

22:36.311 --> 22:37.812
I completely understand
how we all got here.

22:37.846 --> 22:39.647
But I think I'm up to speed now.

22:39.681 --> 22:42.182
- Excellent.
- Thank you.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.451
So,

22:43.485 --> 22:44.618
we've got perimeters set up,

22:44.653 --> 22:45.786
we got Metro going door to door.

22:45.821 --> 22:46.971
We're just gonna have
to wait and see

22:47.005 --> 22:48.155
what sid come up with, okay?

22:48.189 --> 22:51.325
Does the bureau
have anything to add?

22:51.359 --> 22:52.943
No, that sounds
exactly right to me.

22:52.978 --> 22:54.662
Good. Thank you.

22:54.696 --> 22:56.297
Good night.

22:56.331 --> 22:57.498
Excuse me, captain.

22:57.532 --> 22:59.417
Can I talk to you
for a moment?

22:59.468 --> 23:00.735
It's about
Detective Britten.

23:00.769 --> 23:02.870
When I asked you for those files

23:02.888 --> 23:04.922
on recently terminated,

23:04.973 --> 23:07.725
disgruntled or troubled
law enforcement officers,

23:07.759 --> 23:10.761
guess who was in the stack?

23:10.812 --> 23:12.546
Are you saying
that you think

23:12.564 --> 23:15.433
Detective Britten
is the suspect?

23:15.484 --> 23:17.902
I'm saying that for someone
the department has chosen

23:17.936 --> 23:21.522
to keep an eye on, Detective
Britten seems to have

23:21.556 --> 23:23.007
developed
a pretty incredible knack

23:23.041 --> 23:25.576
for being in the right place
at the right time.

23:27.746 --> 23:29.413
Let me go and get Rex,
I'll drop him off at home.

23:29.448 --> 23:31.115
I'll be at the station
in 30 minutes or less.

23:31.166 --> 23:33.200
All right.

24:19.464 --> 24:21.799
What?

24:21.833 --> 24:24.785
We got a call from someone
claiming to be our guy.

24:24.803 --> 24:26.587
When? What did he say?

24:26.621 --> 24:29.473
Let's go. I'll play it for you.

24:33.478 --> 24:35.813
<i>Hello, Elizabeth</i>.

24:35.847 --> 24:37.998
<i>It's me.</i>

24:40.836 --> 24:44.371
<i>Knowing that a local cop
got closer in one day</i>

24:44.406 --> 24:46.440
<i>than you did in 12 years,</i>

24:46.474 --> 24:48.526
<i>or knowing
that someone's going to have</i>

24:48.577 --> 24:50.361
<i>to rewrite the end of that book</i>

24:50.412 --> 24:53.147
<i>you've been slaving away at?</i>

24:53.165 --> 24:55.533
<i>After all we've been through,</i>

24:55.584 --> 24:58.035
<i>you were really going to credit
someone else for my work?</i>

24:58.086 --> 25:00.754
<i>I thought
we were closer than that.</i>

25:05.010 --> 25:07.511
That's it? Short.

25:07.546 --> 25:09.029
Did not have any
luck with the trace?

25:09.064 --> 25:10.181
Yeah.

25:10.215 --> 25:12.332
It took some work,

25:12.350 --> 25:16.103
but he was able to follow it
back to its originating number.

25:17.989 --> 25:20.724
You recognize that number,
Detective Britten?

25:20.759 --> 25:23.844
Yeah. It's mine.

25:23.862 --> 25:26.213
- Did we send a team?
- We did.

25:26.248 --> 25:28.182
We just need your
consent to let them in.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.483
Absolutely. Let's go.

25:29.517 --> 25:30.734
No. Hang on.

25:30.785 --> 25:32.870
Wh-where have you been
for the last hour?

25:32.904 --> 25:36.040
Where have I... been?
I went to go home,

25:36.074 --> 25:37.658
and I had to go...
Why does it matter?

25:37.692 --> 25:40.828
No one else in Los Angeles knows
about that book, Detective.

25:44.249 --> 25:47.501
You... you don't actually think
that I made this call?

25:47.535 --> 25:48.752
Look, no one is making

25:48.803 --> 25:50.838
any accusation... no, no, she is. No.

25:50.872 --> 25:51.839
We're just trying
to put it all together.

25:51.873 --> 25:53.140
Captain, Gemini either is

25:53.175 --> 25:54.842
or was standing
in my living room.

25:54.876 --> 25:56.410
Gemini is dead, Detective.

25:56.444 --> 25:58.229
You're sticking with that? Even
after everything we've found?

25:58.263 --> 25:59.230
What have we found?

25:59.264 --> 26:00.598
You're out running,

26:00.649 --> 26:02.349
you happen to find a body,
which you point out meets

26:02.384 --> 26:04.185
all the publicly available work
of a dead serial killer.

26:04.219 --> 26:06.537
And I mention a two-dollar
bill, you go back

26:06.571 --> 26:09.406
- and lucky you, find a two-dollar bill.
- It's not luck.

26:09.441 --> 26:11.242
There was a dog
at the crime scene.

26:11.276 --> 26:13.244
Then you get dispatched
to follow a set of leads,

26:13.278 --> 26:15.246
and instead, you take your
partner off in one direction,

26:15.280 --> 26:16.697
- While you, alone again,
- My son is home in a few hours.

26:16.731 --> 26:18.215
Go into a building,
seemingly chosen at random

26:18.250 --> 26:18.633
Can we go?

26:18.634 --> 26:20.167
From all the other buildings
along your route,

26:20.202 --> 26:22.253
and lucky again,
you find the killer.

26:22.287 --> 26:26.707
Then after he gets away,
the killer drops us a line,

26:26.741 --> 26:28.742
congratulating you
on your good work.

26:28.760 --> 26:31.452
And of all the phones in the world
he could use, he uses yours.

26:31.453 --> 26:33.964
Do you think if it was me,
I would be dumb enough

26:33.999 --> 26:35.683
to make a call
from my own house?

26:35.717 --> 26:37.218
I think you think you're smart
enough to use a phone,

26:37.252 --> 26:38.219
you think
wouldn't be traceable.

26:38.253 --> 26:39.553
If this was guy was
at my house,

26:39.587 --> 26:40.738
then somehow,
he's redirected the call

26:40.772 --> 26:42.389
to make it look like
it came from my house.

26:42.423 --> 26:45.693
Either way, he's got you two
wasting your time looking at me,

26:45.727 --> 26:47.444
the only person who's made
any headway in the case,

26:47.479 --> 26:49.730
while he's free to pick out
a second victim.

26:49.764 --> 26:51.031
All right, let's talk
about victims.

26:51.066 --> 26:52.566
That guy you found in the park?

26:52.600 --> 26:54.285
Turns out he's got
a lengthy rap sheet

26:54.319 --> 26:56.120
for child abuse and sex offenses.
So what?

26:56.154 --> 26:58.539
I wonder, if you were a cop
losing his marbles,

26:58.573 --> 27:01.375
if that's the kind of guy
you might like to see disappear.

27:01.409 --> 27:04.995
All right, all right, you know
what? That's enough.

27:05.046 --> 27:06.780
Detective Britten,
do we have your consent

27:06.798 --> 27:08.632
- to search your home and your car?
- Yes.

27:08.667 --> 27:11.252
- Can we go?
- You are not going anywhere.

27:11.286 --> 27:12.536
You're running out of time!

27:15.473 --> 27:16.623
Then go and do it.

27:16.641 --> 27:17.958
Be aware of this fact:

27:17.976 --> 27:19.977
That while you're pawing
through my drawers,

27:20.011 --> 27:21.962
trying to find a way
to tie me in,

27:21.980 --> 27:25.266
he's out there free and clear,
ready to deliver another body.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.735
I drove down that street,
Detective.

27:27.769 --> 27:29.086
There were at least
four buildings

27:29.120 --> 27:30.721
that look like someone
might have been

27:30.755 --> 27:32.773
squatting there.
Why did you choose that one?

27:32.807 --> 27:34.158
Why did you choose

27:34.192 --> 27:36.193
the Mountain Top
Moving & Storage building

27:36.244 --> 27:37.444
over all of them?

27:39.748 --> 27:41.949
I told you.

27:44.035 --> 27:45.753
I know.

27:47.656 --> 27:50.624
And now I'm telling you,
I need your weapon.

28:21.803 --> 28:23.254
Where the hell have you been?

28:23.288 --> 28:24.638
I'm sitting here an hour.

28:24.673 --> 28:26.557
I don't hear a word
from you.

28:26.591 --> 28:28.425
You don't answer the phone,
nothing.

28:28.459 --> 28:30.344
I was making sure
Rex didn't come home

28:30.395 --> 28:32.396
while the SID team
was tearing your place apart.

28:39.738 --> 28:41.472
So what are you thinking?

28:41.506 --> 28:43.140
You know what
I'm thinking, Mike.

28:43.158 --> 28:44.158
I'm thinking
I don't know why

28:44.192 --> 28:45.609
you went in that
building either.

28:45.643 --> 28:47.711
I'm thinking that ever
since you came back,

28:47.746 --> 28:48.963
you have been different;

28:48.997 --> 28:51.465
that we don't work as a
team the way we used to.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.118
You playing hunches that you
either can't or won't explain.

28:54.152 --> 28:55.986
You tell me you're going
one way, you go the other.

28:56.004 --> 28:57.705
And then when I
ask you about it,

28:57.756 --> 28:59.907
you say something thin and try to
make it sound like I'm going crazy.

28:59.941 --> 29:01.658
So you think I had something
to do with this?

29:01.676 --> 29:03.711
If I thought you had something
to do with it,

29:03.762 --> 29:06.297
I wouldn't be here.
I'm just saying

29:06.331 --> 29:08.832
don't pretend things
are how they used to be.

29:13.088 --> 29:17.691
Now, uh... they won't let me
take anything

29:17.726 --> 29:18.809
from the evidence room.

29:18.843 --> 29:20.644
Best I can do are these photos.

29:20.678 --> 29:22.613
If you can pull a
rabbit out the hat,

29:22.647 --> 29:24.148
now's the time.

29:29.020 --> 29:30.287
Thanks.

29:46.037 --> 29:48.505
We get any prints back
from these food items here?

29:48.539 --> 29:50.174
Nothing that came up
in the database.

29:50.208 --> 29:51.809
A few partials,
they don't all match.

29:51.843 --> 29:53.677
Who knows how many people
handled that stuff?

29:53.711 --> 29:56.380
All right, here we go.

29:56.398 --> 29:58.766
This napkin,
you recognize that logo?

29:58.817 --> 30:01.885
No, it's a napkin.

30:01.903 --> 30:03.520
Some place with food.

30:03.554 --> 30:04.939
Gemini killer has
to eat, right?

30:04.990 --> 30:10.227
Can we get nat to do
an image search... please?

30:19.237 --> 30:21.672
Bay Street Café,
Gourmet Coffee Shop.

30:21.706 --> 30:22.840
Napkin, mugs...

30:22.874 --> 30:24.625
You can go online
and get a T-shirt

30:24.676 --> 30:26.210
with that thing on it, okay?

30:26.244 --> 30:28.162
Six locations.

30:28.196 --> 30:30.714
So we got Pasadena,
Culver City, South Bay,

30:30.748 --> 30:32.582
Venice, Brentwood, Malibu.

30:32.601 --> 30:35.252
They're all miles away
from the storage place.

30:35.270 --> 30:37.587
Yeah, all in proximity
to a park.

30:37.606 --> 30:40.608
So, he gets a coffee while
stalking his second victim?

30:40.642 --> 30:42.092
Maybe.

30:42.110 --> 30:45.396
Even if we pull all the
units off the other parks

30:45.430 --> 30:46.714
and concentrate
on these six,

30:46.748 --> 30:48.399
we're still talking
hundreds of acres.

30:48.433 --> 30:51.601
We're missing something.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.075
You have the pictures of
the first murder.

31:10.672 --> 31:12.089
Holy...

31:15.310 --> 31:16.727
What?

31:16.761 --> 31:18.095
In the background.

31:18.129 --> 31:19.229
Look at Santoro's cup.

31:19.264 --> 31:21.181
She had that with her

31:21.232 --> 31:22.733
when I picked her up
in Brentwood.

31:22.767 --> 31:25.635
Okay. The Brentwood location

31:25.654 --> 31:27.655
is in the lobby of
the Meridian Hotel.

31:27.689 --> 31:30.908
Which is where
she's staying.

31:30.942 --> 31:34.811
- Hi, you got my voice-mail.
- You know what to do.

31:34.829 --> 31:36.914
I know you're
not calling me back,

31:36.948 --> 31:39.450
but I'm just gonna keep
leaving you messages,

31:39.484 --> 31:42.369
'cause I'm your mom
and I love you

31:42.420 --> 31:43.704
and one of these days,

31:43.755 --> 31:45.706
you're gonna appreciate
that I kept trying.

31:45.757 --> 31:48.425
- Agent Santoro?
- Yeah.

31:52.130 --> 31:54.098
<i>You've reached special agent
Elizabeth Santoro.</i>

31:54.132 --> 31:56.166
<i>Please leave a message
after the beep.</i>

31:56.201 --> 31:57.618
She's not picking up.

32:04.392 --> 32:05.642
Come on.

32:08.396 --> 32:10.814
Okay, put out an attempt
to locate on agent Santoro.

32:10.848 --> 32:12.983
We need all units to respond
to Temescal Canyon Park.

32:13.017 --> 32:14.368
Nobody goes in or out.

32:14.402 --> 32:15.619
What are you doing, Bird?

32:15.653 --> 32:17.654
He can't
be out of there.

32:33.338 --> 32:34.704
Sorry, sir,
park's closed tonight.

32:35.724 --> 32:37.224
Why do you think I'm here?

32:38.259 --> 32:39.843
Keep your eyes open in there.

32:39.877 --> 32:41.878
Always.

33:09.207 --> 33:10.907
Anybody come in
or go out?

33:10.925 --> 33:11.925
Just the FBI guy.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.010
743. Officer needs...

33:13.044 --> 33:14.044
Damn it, follow us.

33:34.016 --> 33:37.072
Elizabeth, did you really
think Minturn was me,

33:37.106 --> 33:38.490
or did you just...

33:38.524 --> 33:40.525
want it to end?

33:40.559 --> 33:44.329
To see you try
to tell the world

33:44.363 --> 33:47.783
I'd failed, I'd lost...

33:47.834 --> 33:51.203
Do you have any idea
how troubling that was?

34:04.801 --> 34:07.018
It's okay.

34:07.053 --> 34:08.553
It's okay, it's okay.

34:08.587 --> 34:11.223
Shh.

34:21.650 --> 34:23.869
Mike.

36:28.194 --> 36:30.528
<i>Is that what you think?</i>

36:30.562 --> 36:31.863
<i>That I want to go without you?</i>

36:31.897 --> 36:33.164
Well, why didn't you tell me

36:33.199 --> 36:35.733
you'd called the movers?

36:38.037 --> 36:40.038
'Cause I'm embarrassed.

36:40.072 --> 36:43.591
I'm embarrassed
that I want this.

36:43.626 --> 36:45.543
That I, that I need it.

36:45.577 --> 36:47.929
That...

36:47.964 --> 36:50.515
When I got off the phone
with the moving company,

36:50.549 --> 36:53.101
or when I got off
the plane in Oregon,

36:53.135 --> 36:55.603
I felt...

36:55.638 --> 36:57.856
I felt hope

36:57.890 --> 37:00.892
like I haven't been able
to for a long time.

37:02.278 --> 37:05.230
I don't know how you do it.

37:05.264 --> 37:09.034
I wish I could be
as strong as you.

37:10.436 --> 37:13.371
That's just something
you have that I don't.

37:16.242 --> 37:19.944
I know... you
think that...

37:19.962 --> 37:22.447
I just want to run away,

37:22.465 --> 37:24.716
but I don't.

37:27.336 --> 37:29.287
I don't want to forget him.

37:31.974 --> 37:36.127
The part of Rex that I want
to remember is right here.

37:42.351 --> 37:43.985
Every time I look at you,

37:44.020 --> 37:46.471
I see our son.

37:46.489 --> 37:48.440
I see who we were

37:48.474 --> 37:50.475
when we were with him.

37:54.163 --> 37:56.915
And what I dream
we could be again.

37:58.868 --> 38:01.453
You think I want
to leave that behind?

38:02.671 --> 38:05.040
You're crazy.

38:08.210 --> 38:09.377
So, you would move?

38:09.428 --> 38:10.762
If that's what she needs,

38:10.796 --> 38:12.530
I'll make it work.

38:12.565 --> 38:15.050
But you and Rex,
you would stay here.

38:15.101 --> 38:16.935
Yeah, he lives here,
he goes to school here.

38:16.969 --> 38:18.169
He has his friends and tennis,

38:18.187 --> 38:21.239
and he doesn't
want to move.

38:21.273 --> 38:23.475
What?

38:23.509 --> 38:25.744
I don't want to give
the wrong impression.

38:25.778 --> 38:28.846
I think this
represents progress.

38:28.864 --> 38:31.900
Imagine that.

38:31.951 --> 38:34.352
I just fear that this progress

38:34.370 --> 38:36.988
is gonna be more painful
than you seem to understand.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.325
<i>Come on, check out that view.</i>

38:40.359 --> 38:42.360
Two bedrooms.

38:42.378 --> 38:44.496
And they say it backs up
to a nature preserve.

38:45.965 --> 38:48.666
<i>I think that your ability</i>
<i>to maintain</i>

38:48.700 --> 38:50.718
these two worlds relies heavily

38:50.753 --> 38:52.537
on the fact that
they're largely the same.

38:52.555 --> 38:54.839
<i>The visual priming</i>
<i>that takes place</i>

38:54.873 --> 38:57.425
<i>as you move through this world</i>
<i>helps you form the other.</i>

38:57.476 --> 38:58.760
What are you doing?

38:58.811 --> 39:00.762
Just enjoying the view.

39:00.813 --> 39:03.064
Look at that. It's beautiful.

39:03.099 --> 39:06.067
I think you're just gassed,
and you're afraid to admit it.

39:08.387 --> 39:09.720
Yeah?

39:11.223 --> 39:12.273
Catch me.

39:12.324 --> 39:14.359
<i>But if your worlds</i>

39:14.393 --> 39:15.760
<i>are completely different,</i>

39:15.795 --> 39:18.780
these connections will erode,
and eventually,

39:18.831 --> 39:21.065
I think one will begin to seem

39:21.083 --> 39:23.451
more and more like what it is.

39:23.502 --> 39:26.921
A fantasy.

39:26.956 --> 39:30.308
So you think if I am
in two different places,

39:30.342 --> 39:31.960
one of them will fall apart?

39:33.129 --> 39:36.631
Dreams are our way
of processing reality.

39:36.682 --> 39:38.550
<i>If you move,</i>

39:38.584 --> 39:41.586
<i>you're processing</i>
<i>an entirely different world.</i>

39:41.604 --> 39:43.721
<i>Living in Oregon,</i>

39:43.755 --> 39:46.774
<i>your mind will eventually</i>
<i>have to let go of L.A.</i>

39:46.809 --> 39:48.109
<i>But understand</i>

39:48.144 --> 39:50.445
<i>I think that</i>
<i>this is a good thing.</i>

39:50.479 --> 39:52.430
<i>In your dream,</i>

39:52.448 --> 39:54.482
<i>you're beginning to recognize,</i>

39:54.533 --> 39:58.403
<i>to wrestle with the fact</i>
<i>that there comes a point</i>

39:58.437 --> 40:01.906
<i>at which you have to move on.</i>

40:01.940 --> 40:04.942
Now, you'll fight it,
which is natural.

40:04.960 --> 40:07.245
It's healthy, even.

40:07.279 --> 40:09.330
But sooner or later,

40:09.381 --> 40:12.300
I think you'll let go.

40:16.455 --> 40:19.007
See, you talk about me
like I'm something

40:19.058 --> 40:21.376
you've studied for
or read in a textbook,

40:21.410 --> 40:22.827
but you don't know.

40:24.897 --> 40:29.017
No, this thing works
because I make it work.

40:30.936 --> 40:34.189
And nothing's gonna change that.

40:34.240 --> 40:35.940
I won't let it.

40:40.796 --> 40:42.197
This is Britten.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.831
<i>Hello, Detective.</i>

40:43.866 --> 40:45.016
Who is this?

40:45.050 --> 40:48.536
<i>You know, it's very strange.</i>

40:48.587 --> 40:50.321
<i>For 12 years,
no one's even come close,</i>

40:50.339 --> 40:53.824
<i>and then in 48 hours,
you and I run in to each other</i>

40:53.842 --> 40:56.211
<i>twice.</i>

40:56.262 --> 40:57.745
<i>I became terribly curious.</i>

40:57.780 --> 41:00.298
<i>Just who is this man?</i>

41:00.332 --> 41:02.800
<i>And what could be his secret?</i>

41:02.834 --> 41:06.170
<i>So, I paid a visit</i>
<i>to your therapist's office.</i>

41:06.188 --> 41:09.641
<i>And now I understand.</i>

41:12.144 --> 41:14.445
<i>Can you really not tell
if you're awake</i>

41:14.480 --> 41:15.647
<i>or asleep?</i>

41:18.284 --> 41:20.535
<i>I bet they've told you
that you're crazy.</i>

41:20.569 --> 41:22.804
<i>That you need help.</i>

41:22.838 --> 41:24.722
<i>That you need to get well.</i>

41:24.757 --> 41:26.241
<i>You see, that's the thing</i>

41:26.292 --> 41:28.993
<i>about guys like you and me.</i>

41:29.028 --> 41:31.496
<i>There's no other way
for us to be.</i>

41:31.530 --> 41:33.298
<i>You take away what makes us us,</i>

41:33.332 --> 41:34.632
<i>and what's left?</i>

41:34.667 --> 41:36.551
<i>No, don't let them
do that to you.</i>

41:36.585 --> 41:40.555
<i>The world needs
a few of us to see it...</i>

41:40.589 --> 41:42.607
<i>Sideways.</i>

41:46.061 --> 41:49.097
Sweet dreams, Detective Britten.

41:49.148 --> 41:52.817
And speaking just for myself,

41:52.851 --> 41:55.853
I'd be very disappointed
if you woke up.

41:58.574 --> 42:00.891
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, flight 402 to Portland</i>

42:00.909 --> 42:03.611
<i>is boarding in ten minutes.</i>
