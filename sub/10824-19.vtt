25:36.169 --> 25:38.071
I DO.

25:38.071 --> 25:40.707
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
HMM?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.776
TOO MANY SHARP
OBJECTS IN THE ROOM?

25:46.547 --> 25:49.850
YES, I...JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO PUSH YOU.

25:52.786 --> 25:54.187
THAT'S WISE.

25:54.187 --> 25:55.722
YES, IT IS.

25:57.624 --> 26:00.093
SO, HOW IS HE?

26:00.093 --> 26:01.401
YOUR FRIEND.

26:01.401 --> 26:03.837
THAT'S RIGHT.

26:03.837 --> 26:06.039
HE'S BETTER.

26:06.039 --> 26:08.141
AREN'T YOU GONNA
ASK HOW I AM?

26:08.141 --> 26:14.915
YOU'RE WALKING,
SO, YOU MUST BE FINE, RIGHT?

26:14.915 --> 26:17.250
YOU KNOW, JEFFERY,
I HAVE THIS COURT CASE

26:17.250 --> 26:20.320
LOOMING OVER MY HEAD.

26:20.320 --> 26:23.256
I HAVE TO DEFEND MYSELF
AGAINST SOME ACCUSATIONS

26:23.256 --> 26:25.458
THAT YOU HAVE
LEVELED AGAINST ME.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.729
SOMETHING ABOUT HIDING EVIDENCE
OF SOME CAR OR SOMETHING.

26:28.729 --> 26:31.164
I WILL WIN.

26:31.164 --> 26:34.601
BUT IT'S BEEN
VERY STRESSFUL,

26:34.601 --> 26:36.903
AND I NEED
A DAY OF LEVITY,

26:36.903 --> 26:41.608
SO WE'LL HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT
PARTY TOMORROW, OKAY?

26:41.608 --> 26:45.078
I SAID I'M NOT...
DOING THAT.

26:45.078 --> 26:47.480
I HEARD YOU.

26:47.480 --> 26:51.151
DID YOU?
YES.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.787
I'M JUST NOT SURE
THAT YOU HEARD <i>ME.</i>

26:53.787 --> 26:56.189
NO.

26:56.189 --> 27:00.060
YOU WILL BE AT MY HOUSE
TOMORROW FOR DINNER,

27:00.060 --> 27:03.269
OR THE POLICE WILL BE
AT CANDACE'S HOUSE

27:03.269 --> 27:06.372
WITH A SEARCH WARRANT.

27:06.372 --> 27:08.775
NO MORE GAMES.

27:12.445 --> 27:16.316
AND JEFFERY...
SON...

27:16.316 --> 27:19.620
IF YOU EVER RAISE
YOUR HAND AT ME

27:19.620 --> 27:22.956
IN ANY WAY AGAIN,

27:22.956 --> 27:26.092
I SWEAR ON
MY DEAD FATHER'S GRAVE

27:26.092 --> 27:28.729
AND ALL OF
MY STILLBORN CHILDREN

27:28.729 --> 27:31.364
THAT WHAT QUINCY DID
TO YOU...

27:31.364 --> 27:36.102
WILL BE A WALK IN THE PARK
COMPARED TO YOUR NEXT VISITOR.

27:38.905 --> 27:40.907
NOW, I WILL SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

27:43.409 --> 27:44.978
I LOVE YOU, SON.

27:49.783 --> 27:54.187
NO, YOU DON'T.

27:54.187 --> 27:58.559
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,

27:58.559 --> 28:01.434
THAT YOU WILL DO
EVERY DAMN THING I SAY.

28:23.089 --> 28:25.491
I SEE YOU IN TROUBLE.

28:25.491 --> 28:28.061
I SEE YOU'RE IN
PRETTY DEEP YOURSELF.

28:28.061 --> 28:29.462
SO, YOU'RE
TALKING TO ME NOW.

28:29.462 --> 28:31.464
OH, YEAH.

28:31.464 --> 28:33.366
I'M TALKING TO YOU NOW.

28:33.366 --> 28:35.435
I SEE.
FOR A MINUTE THERE,

28:35.435 --> 28:37.470
I THOUGHT THESE FOUR WALLS
HAD GOTTEN TO YOU.

28:37.470 --> 28:41.141
OH, NO, I BEEN
IN A SIMILAR SITUATION BEFORE.

28:41.141 --> 28:42.509
YOU BEEN LOCKED UP
BEFORE?

28:42.509 --> 28:44.410
OH, YEAH, BASEMENT.

28:44.410 --> 28:45.646
WORST PLACE THAN THIS.

28:45.646 --> 28:46.847
OH, REALLY?

28:46.847 --> 28:49.550
YEAH, MUCH WORSE PLACE
THAN THIS.

28:49.550 --> 28:50.917
WELL, YEAH.

28:50.917 --> 28:52.352
YEAH, IT WAS AWFUL.

28:52.352 --> 28:55.355
WASN'T FIT
FOR HUMAN EXISTENCE.

28:55.355 --> 28:56.456
OKAY.

28:56.456 --> 29:00.601
THE RATS, OH,
THE RATS DID FINE IN THERE.

29:00.601 --> 29:02.503
LOVED IT.

29:02.503 --> 29:04.237
I'M SURE THEY DO.

29:04.237 --> 29:07.674
HMM.

29:07.674 --> 29:12.278
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
WARRICK MENCY LEWIS.

29:12.278 --> 29:15.682
BORN...
OCTOBER 4, 1984,

29:15.682 --> 29:18.852
RIGHT HERE IN OUR
BEAUTIFUL TOWN OF SAVANNAH.

29:18.852 --> 29:20.053
SO, YOU REMEMBER?

29:20.053 --> 29:23.857
OH, YEAH. YOU BET
YOUR SWEET ASS I REMEMBER.

29:23.857 --> 29:25.626
WHAT WAS TAKING YOU
SO LONG TO COME AFTER ME?

29:25.626 --> 29:29.362
I WAS DOING A LITTLE THING
CALLED BURYING MY DAUGHTER.

29:29.362 --> 29:30.964
I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

29:30.964 --> 29:33.166
I'M SURE YOU DID.
SAD.

29:33.166 --> 29:36.036
NOT HALF AS SAD
AS THE DIRT I'M GONNA SHOVEL

29:36.036 --> 29:38.138
ON YOUR ASS
WHEN I BURY IT.

29:38.138 --> 29:40.373
OKAY.
OKAY.

29:40.373 --> 29:42.475
I TOLD YOU ‐‐

29:42.475 --> 29:45.411
KIDNAPPING A JUDGE
WAS A FEDERAL OFFENSE.

29:45.411 --> 29:47.113
YES, YOU DID.
YES, I DID.

29:47.113 --> 29:49.115
NOW I'VE GOT YOU
RIGHT WHERE I WANT YOU.

29:49.115 --> 29:50.684
YES, YOU DO.

29:50.684 --> 29:53.554
YEAH, I DO.

29:53.554 --> 29:56.022
BUT YOU'RE FORGETTING
TWO THINGS, JUDGE.

29:56.022 --> 29:57.357
WHAT'S THAT?

29:57.357 --> 29:59.726
WE'RE BOTH LOOKING THROUGH BARS
FROM THE SAME POINT OF VIEW.

29:59.726 --> 30:04.404
AND YOU REALLY THINK
THAT MATTERS, WAR...REALLY?

30:04.404 --> 30:05.672
I TOLD YOU
TO HELP ME IN THERE.

30:05.672 --> 30:08.174
I TOLD YOU
TO HELP ME OUT.

30:08.174 --> 30:11.812
I GAVE YOU CHANCE
AFTER CHANCE TO HELP ME

30:11.812 --> 30:16.750
BEFORE THAT BITCH EXTORTED
$7.4 MILLION FROM ME.

30:16.750 --> 30:18.785
WAIT, WHAT?

30:18.785 --> 30:20.186
DON'T SIT THERE
AND PRETEND

30:20.186 --> 30:21.722
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

30:21.722 --> 30:24.390
DID YOU SAY $7.4 MILLION?

30:24.390 --> 30:28.394
READ MY LIPS ‐‐
$7.4 MILLION, WAR.

30:28.394 --> 30:29.696
KILL THAT BITCH!

30:29.696 --> 30:31.632
SHE'S DEAD! DAMN!

30:31.632 --> 30:32.899
SHE'S DEAD! DEAD!

30:32.899 --> 30:34.635
WAIT TILL I GET MY HANDS ON HER!
I'M GONNA KILL HER!

30:34.635 --> 30:36.770
SHE IS DEAD! DEAD!!

30:36.770 --> 30:40.406
GAAH!!
SHE LIED TO ME!

30:40.406 --> 30:42.075
GAAH!!

30:42.075 --> 30:44.444
I'M WANT TO KILL HER!

30:44.444 --> 30:46.046
SHE'S DEAD.

30:46.046 --> 30:47.380
JUST WAIT.

30:47.380 --> 30:49.916
JUST WAIT.
OKAY. OKAY, KID.

30:49.916 --> 30:50.984
OKAY, KID.

30:50.984 --> 30:52.986
ARE YOU DONE
WITH YOUR LITTLE TIRADE?

30:52.986 --> 30:54.220
NO, I'M NOT DONE!

30:54.220 --> 30:55.789
YOU WAIT UNTIL I GET MY HANDS
ON THAT BITCH.

30:55.789 --> 30:57.658
SHE IS DEAD. DEAD!

30:57.658 --> 30:58.959
LIED TO ME TWICE!

30:58.959 --> 31:01.101
SHE LIED TO YOU?
YES!

31:01.101 --> 31:02.969
TWICE?

31:02.969 --> 31:04.805
[ LAUGHS ]

31:04.805 --> 31:08.909
YOUNG MAN,
YOU ARE INCREDIBLY STUPID.

31:08.909 --> 31:11.177
COME CLOSER
TO THESE BARS.

31:11.177 --> 31:13.013
WITH PLEASURE.

31:13.013 --> 31:14.815
SHE LIED TO YOU.

31:14.815 --> 31:17.283
TWICE, RIGHT?

31:17.283 --> 31:19.520
MY HEART WEEPS.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.888
DID YOU REALLY THINK SHE WASN'T
LYING TO YOU, WARRICK?

31:21.888 --> 31:22.923
SHUT UP.

31:22.923 --> 31:24.525
SHE BROUGHT ME THERE.

31:24.525 --> 31:26.126
YOU DID ALL THE WORK.

31:26.126 --> 31:27.561
OF COURSE
SHE LIED TO YOU.

31:27.561 --> 31:29.129
SHE THINKS SHE'S
THE SMARTEST PERSON

31:29.129 --> 31:30.396
IN ANY ROOM SHE'S IN.

31:30.396 --> 31:32.065
THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES.

31:32.065 --> 31:33.333
WELL, SHE'S DEAD.

31:33.333 --> 31:36.036
WELL, DON'T TALK ABOUT IT,
WARRICK. DO IT.

31:36.036 --> 31:38.639
DO US BOTH A FAVOR.
DO IT.

31:46.412 --> 31:49.616
HE'S IN THERE BY HIMSELF.
I CAN GO GET HIM.

31:49.616 --> 31:52.218
NO.
I CAN GO ‐‐

31:52.218 --> 31:54.821
NO, THAT WOULD RUIN
WHAT WE HAVE FOR DAVID.

31:54.821 --> 31:56.122
YEAH, OKAY.

31:56.122 --> 31:58.158
AND IF I GO IN THERE,
HE'LL GET SCARED.

31:58.158 --> 32:00.193
WELL, I CAN CALL MY GUYS
TO COME AND GET HIM.

32:00.193 --> 32:03.937
NO.
IT'S TOO SOON.

32:03.937 --> 32:06.873
I NEED HIM TO LEAD ME
TO THE MONEY.

32:06.873 --> 32:08.675
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
HE'S STAYING OR ANYTHING.

32:08.675 --> 32:12.312
I NEED INFORMATION,
AND THIS IS NOT ENOUGH.

32:12.312 --> 32:14.447
SO, WE WAIT.

32:14.447 --> 32:16.917
YES.

32:16.917 --> 32:19.252
ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

32:19.252 --> 32:20.987
WHAT?
GRAYSON.

32:20.987 --> 32:22.789
UGH, ERICA.

32:22.789 --> 32:24.858
CANDACE, YOU KNOW
THAT HE'S MY MONEY.

32:24.858 --> 32:27.160
YOUR MONEY, I KNOW,
BUT HE'S A PAIN,

32:27.160 --> 32:28.895
AND HE'S SO JEALOUS.

32:28.895 --> 32:30.196
I KNOW.

32:30.196 --> 32:34.400
AND THAT IS WHY
YOU NEED A NEW MARK...

32:34.400 --> 32:36.803
LIKE DAVID.

32:36.803 --> 32:40.040
DAVID, IT IS.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.307
HOW LONG?

32:41.307 --> 32:44.210
AN HOUR AT MOST.

32:44.210 --> 32:46.980
HEY, LOOK ‐‐
WHY DON'T YOU CALL A CAB,

32:46.980 --> 32:50.483
AND I'LL TAKE THIS CAR
AND FOLLOW HIM.

32:50.483 --> 32:52.853
YEAH, OKAY.
THAT'LL WORK.

32:52.853 --> 32:56.056
THANK YOU.

32:56.056 --> 32:59.325
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA
BE OKAY ALONE?

32:59.325 --> 33:03.036
I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING
BUT FOLLOW HIM.

33:03.036 --> 33:05.839
I JUST WANT MY MONEY.

33:05.839 --> 33:07.273
OKAY.

33:17.784 --> 33:19.252
HEY.

33:19.252 --> 33:22.022
YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

33:24.891 --> 33:27.694
TAKE IT.
THANKS.

33:31.765 --> 33:34.367
SO, YOU CAN SAY
"THANK YOU."

33:34.367 --> 33:36.770
OH, YEAH. I CAN SAY ‐‐
I CAN SAY "PLEASE"

33:36.770 --> 33:38.772
AND "YES, SIR,"
AND "NO, SIR," TOO.

33:38.772 --> 33:41.141
OH, STOP IT.

33:41.141 --> 33:42.408
SOMEBODY OBVIOUSLY
TAUGHT YOU MANNERS.

33:42.408 --> 33:43.744
WHO, YOUR MOTHER?

33:43.744 --> 33:45.712
MY GRANDMOTHER.
HMM.

33:45.712 --> 33:47.013
RATHER,
SHE THREW ME IN A DUMPSTER

33:47.013 --> 33:48.549
BECAUSE THE POLICE
WERE COMING.

33:48.549 --> 33:49.916
[ LAUGHS ]

33:49.916 --> 33:53.520
OH, COME ON, THAT'S
A LOAD OF BULL, AND YOU KNOW IT.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.989
SHE WAS WALKING ME
TO SCHOOL ONE MORNING

33:55.989 --> 33:58.124
WHEN SHE NOTICES THE POLICE
CIRCLING THE BLOCK,

33:58.124 --> 33:59.926
SO WE DITCHED
INTO THIS ALLEY.

33:59.926 --> 34:03.003
SHE HAD PUT A STASH OF HEROIN
IN MY BOOK BAG.

34:03.003 --> 34:05.171
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO TAKE MY BOOK BAG OFF OF ME,

34:05.171 --> 34:08.174
SO SHE THREW ME
IN THE DUMPSTER WITH IT,

34:08.174 --> 34:10.777
TOLD ME TO SHUT UP
AND NOT TO COME OUT.

34:10.777 --> 34:13.246
THE GARBAGE MAN FIND ME
EIGHT HOURS LATER

34:13.246 --> 34:14.347
WHEN HE WAS
ABOUT TO DUMP ME

34:14.347 --> 34:16.182
IN THE TOP
OF THE DUMP TRUCK.

34:16.182 --> 34:20.220
IF I HADN'T HAVE YELLED,
I'D BE DEAD.

34:20.220 --> 34:21.722
HOW OLD WERE YOU?

34:21.722 --> 34:23.089
6.

34:25.926 --> 34:27.628
I'M SORRY.

34:27.628 --> 34:29.963
WHAT?

34:29.963 --> 34:32.332
YOU HEARD ME.
I SAID I'M SORRY.

34:32.332 --> 34:33.834
MAN, IF YOU'RE SORRY
ABOUT THAT,

34:33.834 --> 34:36.570
YOU CAN'T HANDLE SOME
OF THE REAL I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

34:36.570 --> 34:40.406
I'M HAVING A VERY HARD TIME
UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

34:40.406 --> 34:41.842
WHAT DON'T
YOU UNDERSTAND?

34:41.842 --> 34:43.309
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU CHOOSE CRIME

34:43.309 --> 34:45.211
AND MURDER WHEN YOU CAN DO
SO MUCH MORE.

34:45.211 --> 34:47.213
NO, YOU CAN DO
SO MUCH MORE.

34:47.213 --> 34:48.882
OH, THAT'S BULL.

34:48.882 --> 34:50.617
MAN, THE SYSTEM
IS SET UP FOR YOU.

34:50.617 --> 34:51.885
I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA GO THAT WAY.

34:51.885 --> 34:55.021
THE SYSTEM IS SET UP
FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WIN.

34:55.021 --> 34:56.189
YOU BEEN RICH
ALL YOUR LIFE?

34:56.189 --> 34:58.058
NO, I HAVE NOT BEEN
RICH ALL MY LIFE.

34:58.058 --> 34:59.492
I WORKED ON A FARM
IN INDIANA.

34:59.492 --> 35:01.635
MY PARENTS DIDN'T HAVE
TWO DIMES TO RUB TOGETHER.

35:01.635 --> 35:04.104
I GOT A COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP
BY PLAYING FOOTBALL,

35:04.104 --> 35:05.506
AND I WORKED MY ASS OFF.

35:05.506 --> 35:06.907
MAN, YOU HAVE
AN ADVANTAGE.

35:06.907 --> 35:08.575
REALLY? WHAT?

35:08.575 --> 35:10.243
YOU'RE WHITE.

35:10.243 --> 35:13.013
OH! THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

35:13.013 --> 35:15.081
YOU THINK SO?
NO, I KNOW SO.

35:15.081 --> 35:16.883
OKAY.
OKAY.

TELL ME SOMETHING,
WARRICK.

35:18.952 --> 35:20.220

WHO HAVE COME
FROM SITUATIONS LIKE YOURS ‐‐

35:22.122 --> 35:24.290
NO, MAYBE EVEN WORSE
THAN YOURS ‐‐

35:24.290 --> 35:26.727

WHAT WAS THEIR ADVANTAGE?

LUCK.

35:29.095 --> 35:30.864
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS LUCK.

35:30.864 --> 35:32.966
IT'S HARD WORK
AND DETERMINATION.

35:32.966 --> 35:35.401
THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT
WHAT WAS GIVEN TO THEM,

35:35.401 --> 35:37.604
AND THEY PUSHED
RIGHT ON THROUGH PAST IT.

35:37.604 --> 35:39.405

35:39.405 --> 35:41.642
TO GET ME TO GO
STRAIGHT, HMM?

TOGETHER?

A RAT'S ASS ABOUT YOU.

AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU ARE NEVER

GOING TO SEE
THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAIN,

ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU

35:55.155 --> 35:56.723
WHEN YOU WERE 6,
THAT WAS HEART‐BREAKING.

35:56.723 --> 36:01.034
IT REALLY WAS,
BUT YOU'RE NOT 6...WARRICK.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.468
YOU'RE A FULL‐GROWN MAN.

YES.

36:19.052 --> 36:20.787
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT?

36:20.787 --> 36:22.956
A LITTLE WHILE AGO, YOU SAID
THAT THERE WERE TWO THINGS

36:22.956 --> 36:24.925
THAT WERE PROBLEMS
BETWEEN US.

36:24.925 --> 36:28.662
ONE OF THEM WERE THE BARS.
WHAT'S THE OTHER?

36:28.662 --> 36:31.197
IT'S GONNA STOP YOU
FROM COMING AFTER ME?

MY LITTLE PHOTO SHOOT.

36:38.605 --> 36:40.707

36:40.707 --> 36:43.309
NOT MY THING, BUT IT'S
A NICE, LITTLE INSURANCE POLICY.

36:44.511 --> 36:46.947
YEAH, SHE'S SOMETHING ELSE.
BUT DON'T WORRY.

WARRICK.

36:52.018 --> 36:54.220

HOW MUCH MONEY DID SHE SAY
SHE GOT FROM ME?

36:57.758 --> 36:59.760
$400K.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.902

37:02.902 --> 37:05.271

37:05.271 --> 37:06.806
OH, YES, IT IS.

37:06.806 --> 37:07.974
THEN I FOUND OUT
THROUGH HER BROTHER

37:07.974 --> 37:09.943
THAT HE THOUGHT
IT WAS $4 MILLION.

37:14.447 --> 37:18.251
IT WAS $7.4 MIL, WAR.

37:18.251 --> 37:23.156
YEAH. WELL, I MADE HER
GIVE ME HALF OF IT.

37:23.156 --> 37:26.059
SO, YOU'RE WHY
SHE NEEDED THE MORTGAGE?

37:26.059 --> 37:27.628
DAMN RIGHT.

37:27.628 --> 37:29.896
SHE SAID SOME DUDE STOLE
THE REST OF IT.

37:29.896 --> 37:31.097
YEAH, I GOT
HALF OF IT BACK,

37:31.097 --> 37:33.233
BUT SHE HAD ALREADY
SPENT THE REST.

I'M SURPRISED
SHE FORGOT THAT.

37:48.882 --> 37:51.117
SHE WENT TO MY PERSONAL BANKER.
SHE'S SMARTER THAN THAT.

37:51.117 --> 37:53.319
NO, SHE'S DESPERATE.

37:53.319 --> 37:56.056
PEOPLE ARE STUPID
WHEN THEY'RE DESPERATE.

37:56.056 --> 37:59.392
THAT IS
A KEEN OBSERVATION.

37:59.392 --> 38:01.167

THE $2 MILLION?

A NICE, TIDY PROFIT,
