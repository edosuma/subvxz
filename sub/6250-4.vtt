00:06.674 --> 00:09.632
[Brennan] /n c/OSIng
my lecture on Interst/t/‘a/
lame/lee remodeling,

00:09.719 --> 00:11.425
I’d like to address some issues...

00:11.512 --> 00:13.753
that are not strictly confined
to forensic anthropology—

00:13.848 --> 00:17.716
-[Snoﬂng]
- if it’s all right
with my host, Dr. Wexler.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.892
I should think that all
but the mostjoyless wonks—

00:19.979 --> 00:21.890
and, yes, I do refer to you,
Cyril Bibby—

00:21.981 --> 00:25.690
would embrace a diversion
from he vers/an systems.

00:25.776 --> 00:29.018
My partner,
F.B.l. Special Agent Seeley Booth,

00:29.113 --> 00:31.274
gave his lecture
at Scotland Yard last night.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.572
Agent Booth, could you
please stand up?

00:33.659 --> 00:36.401
-[Snonng]
- Hey, Booth!

00:36.495 --> 00:38.702
Yeah. I’m here.
What’s up?

00:38.789 --> 00:41.451
Agent Booth is
the intuitive humanist,

00:41.542 --> 00:43.407
while I am
the logical empiricist.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.538
Although recently,
/ have seen...

00:45.630 --> 00:48.463
how destructive
pure logic can be.

00:48.549 --> 00:53.384
My own assistant, the most bn'll/ant
young man / ’ve e ver met—

00:53.471 --> 00:56.759
Ended up a side/rick to
a cannibalistic serial killer.

00:56.849 --> 01:00.433
|-| haven’t invited you
tojoin me, Booth,
so you can take your seat.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.394
[Woman Murmuring]
What / ’i/e learned
from Agent Booth...

01:03.481 --> 01:05.312
is that we scientists
must arm ourselves...

01:05.399 --> 01:08.311
with something other
than pure logic.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.565
A quality which deflects us
from an irrational admiration
for the rational.

01:11.656 --> 01:14.773
Exact/y.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.780
[Booth ]
Ho W old is that guy?

01:18.871 --> 01:20.827
What— Ian?
He’s a yearyounger
than I am.

01:20.915 --> 01:23.702
And almost as brilliant.
What’d you think of my speech?

01:23.834 --> 01:27.418
It got better towards the end.
You mean after
you interrupted me?

01:27.505 --> 01:30.463
I’m sorry. Look.
It wasn’t that I was bored.

01:30.549 --> 01:34.167
Mostly, it’sjust that I was
tired, okay? The boobies took
me out for a beer last night.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.168
“Bobbies.”
They’re called bobbies.
I’m pretty sure that...

01:36.305 --> 01:39.342
Sarah, Pauline andJacqueline
are, you know, boobies—
Dr. Brennan!

01:40.851 --> 01:44.059
Dr. Brennan.
What a wonderful lecture.
Fantastic. Sublime. Great.

01:44.188 --> 01:48.306
Thank you, Dr. Wexler.
Who knew such a shapeless robe
could be so evocative.

01:48.401 --> 01:50.357
Ofacademia I mean,
of course.

01:50.444 --> 01:54.483
Just one moment with
my colleague, please,
Agent Booth.

01:57.368 --> 02:00.155
Urn, over the last few days,

02:00.288 --> 02:04.531
I have been warned many times
to watch out for you.
Warned?

02:04.625 --> 02:06.536
That sounds dangerous.
[ Cell Phone Ringing]

02:06.627 --> 02:08.538
Was it something
along the lines of, oh,

02:08.629 --> 02:10.585
“Look out for Ian Wexler.
He’s a young genius on the rise”?

02:10.715 --> 02:12.876
How can you flirt with me
while ignoring your phone?
[Ringing Continues]

02:12.967 --> 02:15.049
Well, I’m a man of perspective.

02:15.136 --> 02:18.299
Besides, I find that ifone
ignores the thing long enough,
generally it stops ringing.

02:18.389 --> 02:22.632
And then later, at my leisure,
it will tell me what it wanted.

02:22.727 --> 02:24.968
Dr. Ian Wexler.

02:25.062 --> 02:28.475
Don’t leave.
This is noth— Murder?
What kind of murder?

02:28.566 --> 02:32.775
Well, is it a boring one,
or is it a violent one?
Is your interest peaked?

02:32.862 --> 02:35.148
What—
Are you being serious?

02:35.239 --> 02:37.480
I’m going to pass you over
to a colleague of mine.

02:37.575 --> 02:40.533
I’d simply like you
to state the origin
ofthis call. Thank you.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.866
Scotland Yard?
Homicide?

02:44.957 --> 02:47.289
Cheers. Well, would you
like to tag along?

02:47.376 --> 02:49.287
It is murder.
Can’t promise anything,

02:49.378 --> 02:51.369
but it is possible
that a famous heiress
is involved.

02:51.464 --> 02:53.420
I’m keen as ketchup.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.749
Mustard. Keen as mustard.
Excellent effort at
the colloquialism though.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.709
Very impressive.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.383
Does your cowboy
want to tag along?
Please don’t call him that.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.176
He’d find it insulting?
No.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.758
He’d love it.

03:17.323 --> 03:19.564
[Man]
A little higher, john!

03:21.535 --> 03:23.742
[Men Chattering]

03:25.414 --> 03:28.247
[Siren Blares, Horn Honks]
Stand back, please.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.755
[ Ian]
Inspector Cate Pritchard
of Scotland Yard,

03:35.883 --> 03:37.623
I’d like you to meet—
Ah, Agent Booth.

03:37.718 --> 03:41.302
- Yes. Yes.
- Hello. I very much enjoyed
your presentation last night.

03:41.389 --> 03:44.677
He’s very active— sound effects,
visual aids, lots of props.

03:44.767 --> 03:47.850
Although, he complained
at great length about having
to check his gun with us.

03:47.937 --> 03:51.225
Well, you know, without a gun,
I’m practically naked.
Isn’t that right, Bones?

03:51.315 --> 03:53.772
- Inspector Pritchard, meet Dr. Brennan.
- Charming.

03:53.901 --> 03:57.610
She’s exactly like me.
Charming, tenacious,
salacious, sophomoric,

03:57.696 --> 03:59.561
euphoric, nob/e, Ignob/e,

03:59.657 --> 04:03.775
fatuous, horrid, morbid,
torpid and tedious?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.822
Flattery will get you
absolutely nowhere, Cate.
[Chuckles]

04:05.913 --> 04:07.824
So you found Portia Frampton?

04:07.915 --> 04:10.497
The way we usually work
is | drag the bodies
out ofthe Thames...

04:10.584 --> 04:14.327
and you use your
extraordinary capab/l/t/es
to iden tilj/ them.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.413
Bones, they’re like
the English version
of me and you.

04:16.507 --> 04:19.044
- Do you think it might be her?
- This certainly is her car.

04:19.135 --> 04:22.377
Portia Frampton. She’s an
American, as is her father.
Do you know him?

04:22.471 --> 04:24.883
Not all Americans know each other.
There are quite a lot ofthem.

04:24.974 --> 04:28.887
Roger Frampton—
airlines, Internet ventures,
luxury construction.

04:28.978 --> 04:32.311
Full disclosure, Cate.
I’m currently analyzing
one of his construction sites.

04:32.398 --> 04:34.605
Frampton Wishes
to build skyscrapers...

04:34.692 --> 04:38.856
over what may prove to be
a Bronze Age treasure trove
or maybejust a rubbish tip.

04:38.946 --> 04:42.814
- Well, they aren’t
mutually exclusive.
- Exactly.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.365
This vehicle ’5 number p/a te
matches Miss Frampton ’5.

04:45.453 --> 04:48.536
Obviously, this vehicle
entered the Thames
at some distance upstream...

04:48.622 --> 04:49.953
before coming
to ground here.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.783
What do you think, Dr. Brennan?
Female or transvestite?

04:53.878 --> 04:56.085
- Female.
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.172 --> 04:58.379
[Brennan]
late teens, early 205.

04:58.466 --> 05:01.003
Penetrating trauma
to the parietal bone.

05:01.093 --> 05:04.256
Someone hit her on the head
with a sharp object.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.723
You have to do that as well,
do you— translate for him?

05:06.849 --> 05:09.807
You have to deal
with that too?
Is it murder?

05:09.894 --> 05:12.556
- [Together] Yes.
- If this is Port/a Frampton,

05:12.646 --> 05:15.479
then herfather will no doubt
demand F.B.|. involvement.

05:15.608 --> 05:18.850
[Brennan]
Why?
They’re American.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.935
You won’t have any
real jurisdiction,
you understand?

05:21.030 --> 05:23.066
Well, not beyond
what I grant you
out of courtesy.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.068
Well, that whole
“no jurisdiction” thing,

05:25.159 --> 05:27.195
that really doesn’t fly
in the FBI.

05:27.286 --> 05:29.868
-Just tell him he can have a gun.
- But he can’t.

05:29.955 --> 05:34.198
Well, as they say in America,
hasta la vista, baby.

05:34.293 --> 05:38.627
Look, Agent Booth,
Iwill— I will do my utmost
to get you a gun.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.205
In that case—
excuse me—

05:41.300 --> 05:44.792
Bones and I are the best
crime-solving team in America.

05:44.929 --> 05:47.966
Well, we’re in England.
Let’s alljust try
and pull together, shall we?

05:48.057 --> 05:51.220
One nice, little, happy
transnational unit ofinquiry.

05:51.310 --> 05:55.394
Well, we should have
these remains sent back
to thejeffersonian,

05:55.481 --> 05:59.724
as well as any silt samples
and parts of vehicle
that may contain trace evidence.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.070
Well, how do you
feel about that, Dr. Wexler?

06:02.154 --> 06:05.897
Oh, I’m looking forward
to completely surrendering
myselfto Dr. Brennan.

06:05.991 --> 06:09.575
You heard her. Back to
thejeffersonian, all of it.
Put it in the overhead.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.362
[Ange/a Groans]
Brennan sent all
this ewdence from England?

06:47.449 --> 06:52.113
No t just evidence,
but actual human remains.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.946
The Brits
used dental records—
no jokes, please—

06:55.040 --> 06:58.373
- to ident/ﬁ/ the daughter
of a wealthy eX-pat.
- Typical American billionaire.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.918
- Thinks we can do it better.
- Because we can do it better.

07:02.006 --> 07:04.292
- X-rays for you, Clark.
- Thank you.

07:04.383 --> 07:07.216
I’ll take the body, see ifthere’s
any soft tissue worth looking at.

07:07.303 --> 07:09.919
And these crime scene
photos are mine.
[Hodgins] Check it out.

07:10.014 --> 07:14.257
British slime. So much more proper
than American slime.

07:14.393 --> 07:17.305
Some kind of paper.
I’ll see ifthere’s
anything on it.

07:17.396 --> 07:21.856
Okay, as usual, I’ll need
constant progress reports.

07:32.328 --> 07:34.319
Angela.

07:39.918 --> 07:43.376
[Mouths Words]
Oh, my God!

07:51.263 --> 07:53.174
Grayson.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.551
Angela.

07:57.353 --> 08:02.097
That’s the last bit of sugar
you’re ever gonna get from me.
I want my divorce.

08:02.191 --> 08:04.728
[Chuckling]

08:09.990 --> 08:13.574
Portia Frampton, only daughter
of Roger Frampton, 47—

08:13.661 --> 08:16.573
formerly of Ringwood, Newjersey—
and Sarah Frampton,

08:16.664 --> 08:20.031
née Burroughs— deceased 1994—
ofCheltenham, England.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.116
You wouldn’t believe What
my hotel ga ve me for breakfast

08:22.211 --> 08:24.452
It was like this brown goo,
and some kind of meat—

08:24.588 --> 08:28.001
I think it was a sausage—
about the size of my finger.
I had an entire buffet.

08:28.092 --> 08:30.333
[Booth]
You ’re staying at the Duke
ofsometh/ng, all r/ght?

08:30.469 --> 08:32.835
I’m at the Beefeater
Hotel/Motel.
[ Cate] You ate at a Beefeater?

08:32.930 --> 08:36.218
- That’s brave.
- [Booth] Brave is right.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.425
- This is the weakest coffee I’ve ever had.
- Booth, that’s tea.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.886
Okay, two weeks ago,
Miss Frampton was last seen...

08:41.980 --> 08:44.266
leaving her home the morning after
her 21 st birthday party.

08:44.358 --> 08:48.647
It’s quite a coincidence
that Dr. Wexler is working
for the victim’s father.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.693
Well, not working for him actually.

08:50.781 --> 08:53.443
Working for the city.
But I shall check my diary
to see if| killed her.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.741
Portia’s party broke up
around 2:00 am,

08:55.869 --> 08:58.485
and she was reported missing
the following afternoon.
[Booth]Hmm.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.489
The question is, why?
[ /an ] She was probably
reported missing..

09:01.583 --> 09:03.574
- because nobody could find her.
- Ian.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.830
And / suspect the reason
nobody could ﬁnd her was because...

09:05.921 --> 09:07.912
Portia was in a car on the bottom
ofthe River Thames.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.292
- /ust a the0/y, mind
- It’s a great theory.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.966
Can you hold on to that
for one second? Thanks.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.795
Me and Dr. Brennan
will go talk to the family.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.971
- Together?
- [Together] That’s what we do.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.140
Do you hear that, Inspector?
That’s extraordinary.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.637
Sweet.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.346
[ Clark]
Portia Frampton
was struck from behind

09:25.441 --> 09:28.308
Trauma to the zygomatic
suggests that she fell to the ground...

09:28.402 --> 09:31.269
- and then was struck again
at least two more times.
- Weapon?

09:31.363 --> 09:33.775
The Brits weren’t able to recover
all the skull fragments,

09:33.866 --> 09:35.777
- so it’s nearly impossible to tell.
- Excuse me.

09:35.868 --> 09:39.235
/ ’d like you to meet my husband

09:39.329 --> 09:41.945
My soon—to—be ex-husband.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.702
- We must talk.
- This is Birimbau?

09:44.793 --> 09:47.330
I prefer my real name:
Grayson Barasa.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.878
I/e/y n/ce to meet you all

09:49.965 --> 09:53.048
Listen, uh,

09:53.135 --> 09:56.343
/realize that Grayson
Bmmbmw

09:56.430 --> 09:59.046
- He certainly is.
- Thank you.

09:59.141 --> 10:03.100
- He’s a big dude.
- But until Grayson hands over
signed divorce papers,

10:03.187 --> 10:05.803
I don’t really need
Hodgins seeing everybody...

10:05.898 --> 10:08.355
gawking at him like
he’s some kind of god.

10:08.442 --> 10:12.060
Yeah, but he is some kind of god—
the best kind.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.736
Cam. A little help here?

10:14.823 --> 10:17.064
Yeah.
[Mouths Word]

10:18.952 --> 10:20.863
[Sweets]
Oh, my God

10:20.954 --> 10:22.910
Poor Hodgins. Wow.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.205
[laughs]

10:25.292 --> 10:28.534
Look at that guy.
He’sjust—

10:28.629 --> 10:31.712
[laughing]
1 00k at him.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.790
I’m sorry.

10:36.386 --> 10:39.173
[Angela]
Hodgins?
H ey, An gie.

10:39.264 --> 10:44.384
This is Grayson Barasa—
Birimbau.

10:44.478 --> 10:47.220
Please, tell me you are here
to sign the divorce papers.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.181
[Chuckling]
I can’t do that.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.563
I’m still in love with Angela.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.815
Of course you are.
Uh—

10:55.906 --> 10:58.238
[Clears Throat]
I... understand.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.532
But Angela is
in love with me.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.903
I told you, Grayson.
Angela.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.828
Do you remember
the night we met?

11:05.916 --> 11:07.781
Vaguely.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.583
Ah, the waves
were phosphorescent,

11:10.671 --> 11:14.710
like the world was upside down
and we were swimming naked
through the Milky Way.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.587
Bioluminescent phytoplankton.
Nothing mystic.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.795
We talked about how
the universe speaks to us.

11:22.266 --> 11:25.099
And when our lips met—

11:27.145 --> 11:29.636
[Clears Throat]
I apologize.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.268
No worries.
Our lips meet all the time.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.226
Bells.
[Chuckles]

11:35.362 --> 11:36.898
What?
No, Hodgins.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.947
Literally, bells started ringing.
It was nothing cosmic.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.864
Every bell on the island rang out.

11:41.952 --> 11:45.490
It was during the Shark Festival of Bells.
What did you expect to happen?

11:45.581 --> 11:48.573
- A 21-gun salute?
- [Chuckles]

11:52.796 --> 11:56.755
So-So-So what about
the divorce papers?

11:59.636 --> 12:01.968
You need time to talk.

12:07.603 --> 12:09.810
[Both Laughing]

12:09.897 --> 12:13.981
Yuck it up, laughing boy.
Wait until one ofyour
ex-girlfriends comes to visit.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.568
Mmm. Yeah.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.904
Back to work.
Yeah.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.899
[ Hodgins laughs]

12:21.366 --> 12:23.698
[Man]
One of the reasons we moved
away from the States...

12:23.785 --> 12:25.650
was to get away
from the violence.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.994
Now look what happened.
Mr. Frampton, look.
We’re very sorry...

12:28.123 --> 12:30.034
for the loss
ofyour daughter.
What was it?

12:30.125 --> 12:33.242
- Was it a robbery?
- We don’t know yet.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.919
- I’m gonna need
a list of your enemies.
- What enemies?

12:36.006 --> 12:40.295
Well, you ’re a ve/y
aggressive American businessman
living here in England.

12:40.385 --> 12:44.298
- You must have enemies.
- My daughter was a very sweet,
innocent girl.

12:44.389 --> 12:48.803
Not always, Mr. Frampton.

12:48.894 --> 12:51.385
[Roger]
What the hell are
you asking for anyway?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.391
So you can put that picture
away, Dr, Brennan.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.814
Miss Miller,
how close were you
with your stepdaughter?

12:55.901 --> 12:58.813
Heather and I
are not married yet.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.769
Portia was like
a younger sister to me.

13:00.864 --> 13:05.198
- We talked about everything—
c/othes, school, Har/y.
- [Booth ] Hany.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.243
- Who’s Harry?
- Lord Henry Albert Bonham.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.948
Right. Is that
some kind ofcrusty old
politician or something?

13:12.042 --> 13:15.455
Lord Bonham is a very
uncrusty young man—
heir to the Duke of Innesford.

13:15.545 --> 13:18.537
[Booth] Right. Hany
Hen/y Bonham whatever.

13:18.632 --> 13:21.669
I read the tabloids.
There was no mention of Portia
dating any kind of royalty.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.126
The duke wanted it
kept a secret.

13:24.221 --> 13:27.213
The duke would be
the lord’s father.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.761
I got it, Bones.
I understand, okay?
/ ’m just Dying to help.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.979
So the duke says something,
and all ofthe sudden,
magically it happens?

13:33.063 --> 13:35.270
- [Heather]
Welcome to England.
- A murderer’s a murderer...

13:35.357 --> 13:37.313
no matter how close
he is to the throne.

13:37.401 --> 13:41.360
Please, help me find out who
did this to my daughter.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.742
[Brennan]
Why did you rent this?

13:56.837 --> 13:59.419
I didn’t rent this, okay?
They screwed up at
the rent-a-car place.

13:59.506 --> 14:03.294
I ordered an Aston.
You know,James Bond.
But they gave me—

14:03.385 --> 14:06.468
Yeah, they ga ve you an A ustin.
It could happen to anyone. Um—

14:06.555 --> 14:08.716
We drive on the left here,
as you may recall.
[Horns Honking]

14:08.807 --> 14:10.923
Driving here requires
a different skill set.

14:11.018 --> 14:14.385
- I can take the wheel.
I’m an excellent driver.
- [Booth] Thank you, Rain Man.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.390
No, I’m fine. I’ll tell you what.

14:16.481 --> 14:21.441
Back home, we’d drag
the whole royal family in
to interrogation separately.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.393
Let ‘em stew,
catch ‘em in a lie.

14:23.488 --> 14:26.230
We could do that, ifyou like,
but it’ll give them time to close up.

14:26.324 --> 14:29.987
- Do stay to the leﬁ‘ here, please.
- [Horns Honking]

14:30.078 --> 14:32.034
- Close up?
- Tighten ranks.

14:32.122 --> 14:36.456
Nothing is as impenetrable
as the aristocracy freezing out
hoi polloi interlopers.

14:36.543 --> 14:40.286
/ must say, I’m rather looking
forward to two Americans
bearding the lion in his den.

14:40.422 --> 14:43.835
[Cate] The light is red.
[Booth] That’s okay.
/ ’m turning right.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.883
Turning right on a red here
is the equivalent ofturning left...

14:47.012 --> 14:49.549
into the wrong lane
on a red at home.
That makes no sense to me.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.631
The point is,
it’s against the law
to turn on a red—

14:52.726 --> 14:54.762
- Brake! Brake!
- [Screaming]

14:54.853 --> 14:58.186
- Brake!
- [ Tires Screeching]
- [Horns Honking]

14:58.273 --> 15:00.104
- Brake!
- [Screams]

15:00.192 --> 15:02.399
[Horns Honking]
[Man ] Get out ofthe way,
you wanker!

15:02.486 --> 15:06.024
Okay, I think we should
wait here until
the traffic thins out.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.820
God! I hate London!

15:07.908 --> 15:10.991
I hate England!
I’m glad we had a revolution!

15:11.119 --> 15:13.201
[Shouting]
Bollocks!
[ Cell Phone Ringing ]

15:13.288 --> 15:15.074
[Shouting Continues]
B re n n a n.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.907
[ Booth, Shouting]
And the weather here!
It’s cloudy—

15:18.001 --> 15:21.334
The fatty acid composition
ofthe victim’s cervical
fluid caught my attention,

15:21.421 --> 15:23.457
SO I ran some more tEStS.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.584
Turns out Portia Frampton
was pregnant.

15:25.675 --> 15:28.007
- Pregnant? How far along?
- [ Booth] And coffee!

15:28.095 --> 15:29.756
What is so hard
about making a cup...

15:29.846 --> 15:33.759
of black coffee!

15:33.850 --> 15:35.590
About two months.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.597
Thanks, Cam.
[Pounds 0n Roof]

15:38.688 --> 15:40.599
[Sighs]

15:40.690 --> 15:45.104
[ Exhales]
Okay, I feel much better.
What’d I miss?

15:45.195 --> 15:48.653
Lord Henry Bonham,
heir to the Duke of Innesford,
knocked up the victim.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.446
Right.
The royals hate bastards.

15:50.534 --> 15:52.900
- Only the ones that
don ’t make king.
- Hang on, girls.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.576
We’re getting out
ofthis toilet swirl.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.999
[Horn Honking]

16:04.214 --> 16:06.796
[ Booth]
Oh! Nice castle.

16:06.883 --> 16:10.967
[Brennan] No. Castles were
originally designed for military
purposes— to withstand attack.

16:11.054 --> 16:14.888
This is more properly
called a palace.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.808
Bones. A little help
getting out, Bones.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.885
Geez!

16:19.980 --> 16:23.222
God! Geez!
Heads up.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.900
Gettin’ out ofthis thing
is like being born.
[Sighs]

16:29.865 --> 16:32.902
Oh. Is that the duke?
It’s his gentleman’s
gentleman.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.200
It’s a butler.

16:35.287 --> 16:38.620
How ya doin’ there, sport?
Right. F.B.I.

16:38.707 --> 16:41.619
You might as well
put this one away.
It’s worthless.

16:41.751 --> 16:45.289
And yet, here I am.
You mind waiting outside?
Why?

16:45.380 --> 16:48.372
[ Cate] It’s because
Agent Booth not only wants
the aristocrats off-balance.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.545
He wants them upside down.
He’ll annoy them,
you mean?

16:51.636 --> 16:55.174
Let’s say the duke and duchess
won’t be used to your approach.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.176
Listen. Word ofadvice.

16:57.267 --> 17:01.180
When they start commenting
on you to each other,
you’ve got them on the run.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.262
Right.

17:05.275 --> 17:09.393
I noticed in the crime scene
photos that the back seats
ofthe S.U.V. were folded down,

17:09.487 --> 17:11.523
which started me thinking
that maybe the victim...

17:11.615 --> 17:13.856
was transporting something,
you know, worth stealing.

17:13.950 --> 17:17.784
So Brennan had strips of material
sent from the vehicle, which I analyzed.

17:17.871 --> 17:21.284
ST-90 transmission oil.
It’s made with polyalphaolefin.

17:21.374 --> 17:26.368
Leaded, acidic H20 residue,
and plenty of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.795
- Don’t make her ask.
- Thank you, Angela.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.498
A motorcycle was transported
in the back of the S. U. I/.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.504
More likely a scooter,
given the size.

17:33.595 --> 17:37.008
The killer kills,
loads the body
and his scooter—

17:37.140 --> 17:39.176
Or moped.
Drives to the Thames.

17:39.267 --> 17:42.725
Dumps the car,
body and all, in the river,
and rides his scooter home.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.019
Through the teeming
streets of London.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.767
So you’re an honest-to-God
real butler?

17:49.861 --> 17:53.900
My family has served His Grace’s family
for eight generations.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.276
Yeah, well, a real butler
would offer to take my hat.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.786
A real gentleman
would be wearing a hat.
Whoa!

17:58.912 --> 18:00.823
l ook at this guy!
Uh, yes, sir.

18:00.914 --> 18:04.077
/t dates to—
P/ease don ’t touch that,
Agent Booth.

18:04.167 --> 18:08.627
Late 14905 or early 1500s.
German design?

18:08.713 --> 18:11.750
His Grace’s ancestors fought
for Henry VIII in France.

18:11.841 --> 18:15.333
[Scoffs]
Geez! Look at the size of this.
That’s one large cup.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.168
Probably to scare
the sissy French.

18:17.264 --> 18:21.598
Actually, Henry VIII started
the trend of large codpieces
because he had syphilis,

18:21.685 --> 18:24.142
so his penis was extremely sensitive
to anything touching it.

18:24.229 --> 18:29.314
His Grace favors
the “intimidate the enemy” version,
should the topic arise.

18:29.401 --> 18:33.235
His Grace, Her ladysh/p
and lord Hen/y will meet you
in the morning room.

18:33.321 --> 18:36.063
Two weeks, and I’d heard
nothing from Portia.

18:36.157 --> 18:38.409
/knew it would turn out
to be something terrible.

18:38.493 --> 18:41.235
You kept your relationship
with Portia Frampton a secret.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.865
It didn’t mean
I didn’t love her.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.038
Where we come from,
that’s exactly what it means.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.492
You’re quite certain
this American has the right
to pose these questions?

18:48.586 --> 18:50.247
[Booth]
Tell you what.
You call Scotland Yard

18:50.338 --> 18:53.330
and the answer is
always gonna be yes.

18:55.093 --> 18:59.553
So, Portia
ever come to visit
this, uh, palace?

18:59.681 --> 19:01.717
This house? No.
Why?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.220
You were in love with her,
right, Lord?

19:04.311 --> 19:07.599
Well, it’s my understanding
that the class system in England

19:07.689 --> 19:10.305
though ve/y much relaxed
since the Second World Wai;

19:10.400 --> 19:12.436
still exists at
the highest levels of society.

19:12.527 --> 19:16.566
- That’s you, right?
- One prefers not to make
such an assertion.

19:16.656 --> 19:21.776
How long did you and
Portia Frampton carry on
a sexual relationship?

19:21.870 --> 19:23.451
Did I ever say
I was sleeping with her?

19:23.538 --> 19:25.244
Of course you had sex
with her, Harry.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.118
And I’m sure
she rather enjoyed it.

19:27.208 --> 19:30.541
You’re a well-formed,
athletic boy.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.914
Did you offer refreshments?

19:33.006 --> 19:35.463
I had no intention
ofencouraging them
to stay longer, Mother.

19:35.550 --> 19:36.881
Tea, please.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.960
Har/y kept his relationship
with the Frampton girl secret...

19:40.055 --> 19:42.091
because her father
is a rapacious crook...

19:42.182 --> 19:46.391
who uses Intimidation and bribe/y
to get what he wants.

19:46.478 --> 19:49.345
So it had nothing
to do with this?

19:49.481 --> 19:53.599
They’ve brought that
wretched rag into the house.
I was there.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.275
It was the afternoon before
Portia’s birthday party.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.947
- So you saw the photographer?
- Of course not. I’d have thrashed him.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.773
The lord was gonna
go all medieval.

20:01.868 --> 20:05.611
P0/t/a ’s pan‘y was lo vely.
She leﬁ‘ before / a woke the next morning.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.912
It’s the last time I saw her.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.955
- But you did hear from her.
- [Booth ] Right, because...

20:10.043 --> 20:14.332
cell phone records
indicate that you talked
that morning.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.538
It was a very personal conversation.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.794
Did you discuss her pregnancy?

20:20.887 --> 20:23.799
/ got it. / 7/ tell you what.
There was an argument.

20:23.932 --> 20:28.266
Portia wanted to keep
the baby. You didn’t.
/ assure you,

20:28.353 --> 20:30.560
I had absolutely no idea that—

20:30.647 --> 20:34.481
Could he possibly be suggesting
that pregnancy is a motive for murder?

20:34.567 --> 20:37.024
Nonsense. Arrangements
would have been made.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.694
And you’re positive
that you’re the father?

20:39.781 --> 20:41.112
Harry.
Look at that.

20:41.199 --> 20:44.157
I’m being intimidated
by royalty.

20:44.244 --> 20:48.533
Ifyou must know,
Portia broke up with me.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.534
She said there was
to be no discussion.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.661
[Booth]
Ah. There you go.
Motive for murder...

20:52.752 --> 20:55.084
no matter
what country we’re in.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.162
[Sips Lo
ud
Mmm! Iy}

20:57.298 --> 20:59.914
What is this?
It’s Assam black tea.

21:00.009 --> 21:02.751
Very strong.
Call it the upper-class version...

21:02.846 --> 21:05.758
of a “cup o’joe.”
Wow!

21:05.849 --> 21:07.510
Cheers.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.727
[Ange/a On Speaker]
/’ve been looking at those
tabla/d photos of the victim

21:13.815 --> 21:17.353
Now, in a telephoto shot,
most ofthe frame is blurry.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.935
Only the main subject
is in focus.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.860
What is this place
on the weekends?
A dungeon?

21:21.948 --> 21:27.614
You see here? These pixels
look like they’ve been
altered to appear fuzzy.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.569
So it wasn’t really
a telephoto lens?

21:29.706 --> 21:32.322
You light it
with torches, right?
No, it was a telephoto lens.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.830
But it’s been doctored
tolookasthough
it’s over 500 millimeters,

21:35.920 --> 21:38.127
when I put it
at more like 80.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.500
[Cate]
Why would anyone do that?

21:40.592 --> 21:44.380
- See that white sliver?
- Do you mean the white blob?

21:44.471 --> 21:46.211
It’s a reflection of light,

21:46.306 --> 21:49.139
almost as though
the photographer
was behind glass.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.683
And in Portia ’s e yes—
Do you see that?

21:52.770 --> 21:53.896
[All]
No.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.720
It’s a reflection ofa house.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.727
Do you see where I’m going?

21:58.818 --> 22:01.560
[All]
No.

22:01.654 --> 22:05.192
- Someone took the picture
inside the house.
- With an 80-millimeter lens.

22:05.283 --> 22:08.946
Sweetie, my ex-husband is here
with the divorce papers.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.948
So I’ll fill you in
when you get back.

22:11.039 --> 22:14.122
Lovely mix of
personal and professional
you people seem to manage.

22:14.209 --> 22:16.871
Harry could have taken
the photograph.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.872
Yes, that’s certainly
a possibility.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.919
But Harry had no motive
to take the photo.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.875
We’re most likely searching
for a disgruntled servant
who was looking to cash in.

22:44.155 --> 22:46.612
Mmm.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.690
I apologize for
eating without you,

22:48.785 --> 22:51.822
but apparently to hold the table,
you have to order.

22:51.913 --> 22:55.326
I’m not here for food.
I’m here to get you
to sign the divorce papers.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.122
Hmm.

22:57.210 --> 23:00.122
In my place,
would you do that?

23:00.213 --> 23:02.579
I’m not in your place.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.630
I’ve been searching
for Angela for five years.

23:04.717 --> 23:09.086
I know. I know.
Our private investigator
told us everything.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.592
You built Angela a home
with your bare hands...

23:11.683 --> 23:14.971
while simultaneously
smuggling medicine
to children in Cuba...

23:15.061 --> 23:17.268
and supporting an orphanage.

23:17.397 --> 23:20.434
You’re a saint. I get it.
Ifyou believe that
to be true,

23:20.525 --> 23:22.766
then you should want
what is best for Angela.

23:22.860 --> 23:26.444
I do. And guess what?
It’s me.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.738
Why are you better than me?

23:28.825 --> 23:32.363
Obviously, I’m not.

23:32.495 --> 23:35.532
But I do love her
more than you.
You cannot possibly know that.

23:35.623 --> 23:38.285
And yet, I do.

23:40.044 --> 23:42.000
We are at an impasse.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.976
You have no sense ofdignity.

24:03.067 --> 24:07.686
Yeah, I’d give up
my life for Angela.
So what’s a little dignity?

24:07.822 --> 24:11.360
She kissed me, you know.
On the cheek, or—

24:12.744 --> 24:15.531
What’s going on?
Oh, man.

24:15.622 --> 24:18.079
He says you kissed him.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.952
I did.
Whoa!

24:20.084 --> 24:23.042
It was a good-b ye kiss.
There’s nothing you can do.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.745
- You must accept—
- Hodgins!

24:25.882 --> 24:29.249
Here. Can—
Can you take this, please?
Oh!

24:32.472 --> 24:34.428
Whoa!

24:34.515 --> 24:37.052
Nice, Grayson!

24:40.647 --> 24:41.636
Angela.

24:47.737 --> 24:49.898
[Brennan]
We ’ve been working on
ident/ﬁ/mg the photographer...

24:49.989 --> 24:52.025
who took the tabloid picture
of Portia.

24:52.116 --> 24:54.983
Surely, identifying her murderer
is more important.

24:55.078 --> 24:56.864
You see, paparazzi,
they follow people.

24:56.954 --> 25:00.788
So maybe he saw something.
I don’t know, maybe the actual killer.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.958
The photo was taken from
a bedroom in Portia’s home.

25:04.045 --> 25:07.913
So you’re suggesting
the help let a paparazzo
into the house?

25:08.007 --> 25:11.966
Actually, the help
told Inspector Pritchard
that you were in the room.

25:12.053 --> 25:15.511
look, maybe you wanna tell us
why you did it before
Roger gets here.

25:15.598 --> 25:19.056
Roger and I have set
five wedding dates
over the years.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.850
And each time,
P0/t/a found a way
to make h/m postpone.

25:21.938 --> 25:24.725
- She had her father wrapped
around her little finger.
- So you killed her?

25:24.816 --> 25:28.729
Don’t be ridiculous!
I merely wanted Roger
to regard Portia...

25:28.820 --> 25:34.736
as a sexually mature adult
with her own agenda
instead ofas an innocent child.

25:34.826 --> 25:38.535
Sorry I’m late. Court went
rather longer than expected.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.699
Heather, I trust
you’ve said nothing.
Too late.

25:40.832 --> 25:43.369
[Roger]
Too late why?
Your girlfriend...

25:43.459 --> 25:45.199
sent the naked picture
ofyour daughter to the tabloids...

25:45.294 --> 25:48.832
so you’d stop thinking
that she was perfect
and finally get married.

25:48.923 --> 25:51.915
What Americans lack in subtlety,
they make up with clarity.

25:52.009 --> 25:54.261
Roger, I’m so sor/y.

25:54.345 --> 25:56.085
Why the hell
would you do that?

25:56.180 --> 25:58.671
Please, believe me,
/ would never do anything
to harm Port/a.

25:58.766 --> 26:01.849
I simply made
a terrible mistake.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.141
Roger! Oh, Roger!

26:06.232 --> 26:08.439
/ trust this interview is over?

26:08.526 --> 26:12.144
Actually, Ijust have one more question.
Who the hell would wanna wear this?

26:16.159 --> 26:20.118
It’s so nice to see you relaxing,
enjoying some good British beer,
Agent Booth.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.365
Cheers.
Cheers.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.698
I’ll tell you what.
I’d like to see that open.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.748
Real/y?

26:26.836 --> 26:29.122
Why?
Luck.

26:29.213 --> 26:32.330
You’d have to be ridiculously lucky
to see something like that,
wouldn’t you?

26:32.467 --> 26:34.879
That’s my point.
[Chuckles]

26:34.969 --> 26:37.085
Well, you did get
a little lucky today.

26:37.180 --> 26:38.841
Yeah?

26:40.892 --> 26:44.225
That’s a Walther PPK.
It’s ajames Bond gun.

26:44.312 --> 26:46.428

26:46.522 --> 26:48.979
No. That’s terrible.

26:51.152 --> 26:53.518
Thanks, Pritch.

26:54.697 --> 26:56.688
But please
just remember, though...

26:56.783 --> 27:00.401
that ifyou do use it,
I’m the one they’ll hang.

27:01.579 --> 27:03.740
Hey, I’m a good shot.

Oh.

Oh. It’s the American squints.

27:08.669 --> 27:12.127
You’ll love these people.
Booth. Seeley Booth.

27:12.215 --> 27:14.501
[Ange/a On Speakerphone]
Hey, uh, the paper you sent me—

27:14.592 --> 27:17.959
it turns out to be a letter
to Portia Frampton from her mother.

27:18.054 --> 27:21.012
A keepsake from
her childhood perhaps?

27:21.140 --> 27:23.552
It’s dated this year.
[Booth]
What does the letter say?

27:23.643 --> 27:27.386
The entire body of
the letter is indecipherable.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.597
The date and the salutation
and the signature are clear though.

27:30.691 --> 27:32.067
Thanks, Ange.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.188
So Portia Frampton’s mother
is still alive?

27:35.279 --> 27:38.567
That raises a whole set ofquestions.

27:40.159 --> 27:43.196
[ Clark On Speaker]
I/is/b/e on the l2 is
an area of radio/ucency

27:43.287 --> 27:46.029
Can ’t see a damned thing.
[Brennan]
Give us a moment, Clark

27:46.165 --> 27:49.407
We found a few more bone
fragments today, Dr. Wexler.
Good. How old?

27:49.502 --> 27:51.288
No more than a hundred years.

27:51.379 --> 27:53.836
To prevent Frampton
from building his beloved
skyscrapers on this site,

27:53.923 --> 27:55.914
we need to find something
from the Bronze Age or older.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.465
There is evidence of reabsorption
ofthe surrounding bone.

27:58.553 --> 28:01.340
Ah, here. Yes, | see.
Very interesting.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.762
Cyril, you’re being impertinent.
Please stop speaking.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.842
- Could the anomaly
be a hemangioblastoma?
- Okay, off you go.

28:06.936 --> 28:12.522
And don’t come back until
you find at least one Bronze Age,
ossified funny bone.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.940
Have Cam do a histology, Clark.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.439
Will do, Dr. Brennan.

28:19.448 --> 28:23.441
[Clears Throat]
So, what now?
Well,

28:23.536 --> 28:26.994
I thought quick drink,
back to yours for some sex
and then out for a late supper.

28:27.123 --> 28:29.034
Oh—
[Chuckles]

28:29.125 --> 28:31.036
[Chuckles]
I’m inclined to accept.

28:31.168 --> 28:34.205
Well, I’m ever so pleased.
But Booth says
I shouldn’t trust you.

28:34.338 --> 28:37.250
And why is that?
Well, he says you like
to rack ’em up.

28:37.341 --> 28:38.842
Rack ’em up?
How vulgar.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.050
Booth is very good
at reading people.
Hmm.

28:41.137 --> 28:43.423
Well, in that case,
how about we start
with the supper...

28:43.514 --> 28:46.221
and then let the chips fall
where they may?

28:46.309 --> 28:48.265
That would be
an acceptable compromise.

28:53.274 --> 28:57.233
[ Hodgins ] / checked out

Mother—of—pea rl.

29:00.364 --> 29:02.696
Have you talked to Angela today?

29:02.783 --> 29:05.866
Yes. Are you saying our victim
was attacked by an abalone?

29:05.995 --> 29:08.657
How mad is she?
Mad, mad, mad.

29:08.748 --> 29:12.582
I thought women secretly liked it
when we fought over them.

29:12.668 --> 29:15.125
“Women” is an unacceptable
generalization.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.884
[ Brennan]
You should look over
your other shoulder.

29:23.971 --> 29:26.212
Bones, I’ve been driving
since I was 12, okay?

29:26.307 --> 29:29.674
Would it make you less agitated
ifI told you I didn’t sleep
with Dr. Wexler last night?

29:29.769 --> 29:34.138
I’m not agitated, okay?
I’m agitated because ofdriving
this little car. That’s all.

29:34.231 --> 29:37.769
Look, Wexler isjust—
[Sighs]

29:37.860 --> 29:40.067
I’m not agitated because of
you and Dr. Wexler.

29:40.154 --> 29:42.770
Wexler’sjust another guy
looking for a one-night stand.
That’s— Whoa!

29:42.865 --> 29:45.277
So?
So? You gotta
take it seriously.

29:45.368 --> 29:48.531
Seriously? You mean
you’ve never laughed
during sex? Because I do.

29:48.663 --> 29:50.699
Whoa!
Do you see that lorry?

Well, I think Dr. Wexler is serious
about having sex with me.

30:01.926 --> 30:04.338

Okay, news bulletin for you.
Very interested.

30:04.428 --> 30:07.465
Bones, there’s not a guy
in this country who wouldn’t
wanna have sex with you.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.

or awful about British men?

had a Turtle Party Wagon.

to hire an arborist,

33:42.730 --> 33:46.097
I’m in the hospital—
broken arm, concussion—

33:46.192 --> 33:48.774
and the kid with
the Party Wagon comes in.

33:48.861 --> 33:51.773
I confess everything.
You know what he says?

33:53.490 --> 33:55.071
“I would have given it to you.”

33:55.159 --> 33:57.866
Ah. He had a little
gay crush on you.

33:57.995 --> 34:00.782
He did?
Mm-hmm.

34:00.873 --> 34:03.410
Oh, man, that explains a lot.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.708
But I’m guessing that
you have a different
point to the story,

34:06.795 --> 34:10.037
like maybe
I’m the Party Wagon.

34:10.132 --> 34:12.373
No. You’re the gay neighbor boy.

34:12.468 --> 34:17.588
Your love is the Party Wagon.
Grayson is the tree.
I’m Hodgins. Think about it.

34:17.681 --> 34:21.845
Which brings us
back to the point that
all men are idiots.

34:21.936 --> 34:24.643
See how I worked that?

34:26.106 --> 34:28.483
It’s because I’m so good.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.558
Uh, uh-huh.

34:30.653 --> 34:33.941
The treads in
the victim’s tires were
mostly full of river silt.

34:34.031 --> 34:38.024
But I did find
a few more materials.

34:38.118 --> 34:40.860
Crushed Scleractinian coral.

34:40.996 --> 34:43.578
Possibly from Australia.
She was killed in Australia?

34:43.666 --> 34:46.123
No, it’s used as a surface
for private roadways in England.

34:46.252 --> 34:49.415
How does that help us?
Well, it’s been illegal to
harvest this stuff for years.

34:49.505 --> 34:51.416
So the roadway in question
is fairly old.

34:51.507 --> 34:53.372
And even when this stuff
was available,

34:53.509 --> 34:55.591
it was
incredibly expensive.
And the organic material?

34:55.678 --> 34:57.339
Yeah.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.011
Deciduous pinnate leaflets—
medium pink petals.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.138
Hey, Hodgins?

35:05.229 --> 35:07.686
Yeah,hey.
Hi, Angela.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.267
Fine, / 7/ just pass this along to
Booth and Dr. Brennan in England

35:13.362 --> 35:15.603
You guys go ahead and—

35:15.698 --> 35:17.780
Security cameras, people.

35:17.866 --> 35:20.403
The building’s filled
with security cameras.

35:21.912 --> 35:24.949
I can’t have you
punching my ex—husbands.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.407
Deal, so long as you don’t kiss
your ex-husbands...

35:28.502 --> 35:31.494
for longer than three seconds
on the lips.

35:32.715 --> 35:34.751
Deal. Look.

35:34.842 --> 35:37.925
It’s simple.
My heart isn’t yours to claim.

35:38.053 --> 35:39.964
It’s mine to give away.

35:40.055 --> 35:42.341

not your heart.

35:42.433 --> 35:45.800
Oh, idiot.
You do get my heart.

35:45.894 --> 35:48.180

of understanding.

What’s it doing
up on the truck?
Crushed coral and rose petals?

36:44.620 --> 36:48.613
Hodgins found coral and roses
in Portia Frampton’s tires.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.540
Who takes a car with a flat tire
and puts it up on a truck?

36:51.627 --> 36:55.415
You fix it. That’s what you do.
Ifthere was a spare tire, I’d have fixed it.

36:55.506 --> 36:59.340
Probably you cracked an axle
or something. Thanks, Cam.
That was very useful.

36:59.426 --> 37:01.462
All right, great.
Now I gotta call Agent Pritchard.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.135

- Don ’t smell that. You don’t
know where that’s been.
- Yes, /do.

37:11.855 --> 37:15.393
This is crushed coral,
and it smells like roses.

37:15.484 --> 37:18.146
[Sniffs]
Where did we pick up
crushed coral?

37:18.237 --> 37:21.445
The private
road and driveway
at the Bonham estate.

37:21.532 --> 37:24.820
Portia Frampton drove
to the Bonham estate
just before she died.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.367
And the royals said
she never came to the house.

37:27.454 --> 37:28.990
They lied.

37:36.088 --> 37:38.625
You honestly believe
the Duke of Innesford...

37:38.715 --> 37:41.127
is Portia Frampton’s
biological father?

37:41.218 --> 37:44.301
Both he and his mother
show symptoms of V.H.L. disease.

37:44.388 --> 37:47.130
Well, we ’re standing on coral,
those are rose bushes,

37:47.224 --> 37:50.307

that could fit very nicely

[Booth]
Whynot?

38:08.287 --> 38:11.120
We won ’t need guns because
we have the letter
from Portia ’5 mother.

- Ah. But they don’t know that.

38:15.419 --> 38:17.705

38:17.796 --> 38:21.004

that weapon away?

38:22.801 --> 38:25.463
Fine. Itjust feels wrong.

38:25.554 --> 38:29.763
I have a letter addressed
to Portia from her mother.

38:29.850 --> 38:32.136
- Portia’s mother died 14 years ago.
- She wrote it on her deathbed.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.684

Well, you know
what this means.

- Why?

Please trust me.

39:12.601 --> 39:15.092
This is not the way for Harry
to discover certain harsh truths.

39:15.187 --> 39:17.303
Please, Harry.
A little trust.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.434
That must be one hell ofa letter.

you I had no idea ofthis before Portia
read the letter to me.

39:28.867 --> 39:32.451
You met with Portia here?

39:33.372 --> 39:35.488
What did it say?

39:35.582 --> 39:38.995
It says that the duke was
Portia’s biological father.

39:39.086 --> 39:41.293

57:03.879 --> 57:06.256
[Grunting, Shouting]

57:08.801 --> 57:11.838
And the guy with the tattoo
is taking him away

57:15.224 --> 57:18.808
IfI thought they
were going to kill him,
then I’d have done something.

57:18.894 --> 57:23.888
Don’t beat yourself up, pal.
You know, I’m sure you did
the best you could.

57:27.778 --> 57:29.769
with his friends
Mr. Scotch and Mr. Merlot.

57:29.864 --> 57:31.855
Blood alcohol level was .18.

57:31.949 --> 57:34.110
No drugs,
recreational or otherwise.

57:34.201 --> 57:37.034
[ Beeping]
And no evidence of nicotine.

57:37.121 --> 57:39.112
So what was the cigarette
doing in his hand?

57:39.206 --> 57:41.788
Put there to justify the explosion,
I would imagine.

57:41.876 --> 57:43.741
What have you found,
Mr. Edison?

57:43.836 --> 57:46.543
Well, ifthe casts are accurate,

57:46.631 --> 57:49.998
new bone growth formed a craggy
surface on the scapu/as...

57:50.092 --> 57:53.334
- and both the left and right
lateral epicondyles.
- Meaning?

57:53.429 --> 57:57.047
The victim had bursitis caused
by strenuous repetitive motion.

57:57.141 --> 57:59.382
The only time / ’ve seen this
was on an autopsy of a scul/er.

57:59.477 --> 58:02.935
- What is that? Like a fish?
- A sculler is someone
who crews on a rowing team.

58:03.022 --> 58:05.855
/a/so examined the fracture
to his frontal bone.

58:05.941 --> 58:08.318
- /t was the result of a head butt.
- Ouch.

58:08.402 --> 58:12.736
- I concur. I’ll send your
findings to Dr. Brennan.
- Thank you.

58:12.823 --> 58:15.030
What are you working on, Angela?

58:15.117 --> 58:18.450
Blowing up all the photos of
the remains for Clark and Hodgins.

58:18.579 --> 58:20.911
Trying
not to lose quality.
Excel le nt.

58:22.416 --> 58:27.001
Oh, one other thing.
I slept with your husband—
ex-husband.

58:27.088 --> 58:29.830
- What?
- Good-bye.

58:29.924 --> 58:31.880
Don’t leave, Mr. Edison.
I need a witness.

58:31.967 --> 58:34.379
I’m sure you can find
somebody who ’5 been here
longer than / ha ve.

58:34.512 --> 58:36.878
Are you one of us or not?
No, I’m not one of us.

58:36.972 --> 58:39.384
Well, you’ll do anway.Just—

58:39.475 --> 58:43.059
Angela, I slept with him,
and | feel really weird about it.

58:43.145 --> 58:46.729
Wai— How? Did—
I mean, when?

58:46.816 --> 58:50.729
- Oh, God.
- Grayson’s flight was canceled,
and one thing led to another.

58:50.820 --> 58:54.529
He ’5 very attractive, so...
we spent the night together.

58:54.615 --> 58:56.401
/ ’m sorry.

58:57.618 --> 59:00.610
[Sighs]
It’s okay.

59:00.705 --> 59:02.536
ReaHy?

59:02.623 --> 59:04.989
Of course. Why not?

59:06.335 --> 59:08.371
We’re divorced, so—

59:08.462 --> 59:12.171
I mean, I got what
I wanted from him,
so now I guess you did too.

59:12.258 --> 59:14.340
Well, yeah.

59:14.427 --> 59:17.009
Can I go now, please?

59:17.096 --> 59:22.011
- Angela, I— You are an amazing person.
- Why are you amazing now?

59:22.101 --> 59:24.888
I slept with Grayson,
and Angela’s okay with it.

59:24.979 --> 59:27.641
- Of course.
- [Chuckles]

59:27.732 --> 59:29.768
Why should I care?
I’m gonna marry you.

59:29.859 --> 59:32.692
Well, I see no holes
in your logic.

59:32.778 --> 59:35.190
And he’ll be gone in a day.

59:35.281 --> 59:39.320
He’s still here?
Wow, that... must’ve gone well.

59:39.452 --> 59:41.864
Is that something for me?
Uh, yeah.

59:41.954 --> 59:44.696
It’s preliminary results
of particulate and bug analysis.

59:44.790 --> 59:49.625
Now, I found
microphytobenthos algae,
epipsammic and epipelic diatoms,

59:49.712 --> 59:52.078
as we/las
a Chironomus riparius,
orm/dge ﬂy,

59:52.173 --> 59:54.255
all ofwhich were
on the clothing shreds
they sent me.

59:54.341 --> 59:56.627
Well, you’re excited,
so it must mean something.

59:56.719 --> 1:00:01.088
The levels and sediment
on the algae indicate that the victim
was near Henley-on-Thames...

1:00:01.182 --> 1:00:03.673
within 24 hours of his death.

1:00:03.768 --> 1:00:07.306
The Henley Royal Regatta
takes place there— rowing.

1:00:10.441 --> 1:00:13.023
[Brennan]
Why are you doing this with me
and not Inspector Pritchard?

1:00:13.110 --> 1:00:15.522
Oh, come on, Bones.
You and me, we’re the real deal.

1:00:15.613 --> 1:00:19.276
Look, she’s having a tough time
with this. I would, too,
ifyou were killed.

1:00:19.366 --> 1:00:20.947
You’re sentimental
that way.

1:00:21.035 --> 1:00:23.526
Excuse me. The guy at
the main boathouse told me...

1:00:23.621 --> 1:00:26.328
that Dr. Wexler was
a teammate ofyou blokes.

1:00:26.415 --> 1:00:29.703
- Blokes?
- Yeah, you know.
Kinda feelin’ at home.

I have a few questions—

1:00:35.966 --> 1:00:38.378
Hey, I’m talkin’ here.
I think you’re
a bit lost, mate.

whatever you want.

with Scotland Yard

Ian was a friend of mine.

God, the man’s got a head
like a boulder.

1:00:55.486 --> 1:00:57.772
You’re the American bird
Wexler was talking about, aren ’t you?

1:00:57.863 --> 1:01:00.400
I’m surprised that lady cop of his
isn ’t looking out for him.

1:01:00.491 --> 1:01:03.198
Yeah, the two ofthem seemed,
uh, more than colleagues.

1:01:03.285 --> 1:01:06.903
Inspector Pritchard and Dr. Wexler
had a sexual relationship?

1:01:06.997 --> 1:01:09.989
listen, lo ve, Ian isn’t exactly
the faithful type, so ifhe’s
promised you something—

1:01:10.084 --> 1:01:12.120
He’s dead.
He was murdered.

1:01:12.211 --> 1:01:13.621
No.
What?

1:01:13.712 --> 1:01:17.375
We had a race this afternoon.
I thought we’d be seeing him.

1:01:17.466 --> 1:01:19.457
That’s a pretty distinctive
tattoo you got there.

1:01:19.552 --> 1:01:22.635
Any chance you were
at the Highgate Club
night before last?

1:01:22.721 --> 1:01:25.178
[Stammers]
Wait. You think we killed Wex?

1:01:25.266 --> 1:01:28.679
- You dragged him out
ofthe club, didn’t you?
- This is bollocks!

1:01:28.769 --> 1:01:32.512
We had a race. We don’t
sober Wex up in time,
he’s no good to us.

1:01:32.606 --> 1:01:36.098
- His timing is discombobulated
from the alcohol.
- So you beat him up?

1:01:36.193 --> 1:01:40.277
No. We dragged him into
a bed in the boathouse and poured
coffee into him in the morning.

1:01:40.364 --> 1:01:43.106
His frontal bone was bruised.

1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:45.862
His forehead.
Maybe you gave him a good
crack like youjust gave me?

1:01:45.953 --> 1:01:50.287
No! He didn’t head-butt Wex.
Tell you who did— a coxswain
for the Queen’s Light Guards.

1:01:50.416 --> 1:01:53.658
What’s his name?
It’sJasper Ferry.

1:02:02.261 --> 1:02:04.468
[Camera Shutters Clicking]

1:02:04.555 --> 1:02:07.718
Booth, he’s not gonna talk to you.
It’s a trad/tron.

1:02:07.808 --> 1:02:10.094
I know that, Bones,
but I think I almost got him.

1:02:10.185 --> 1:02:13.222
There’s a little sweat
coming offthe side of his face.

1:02:13.314 --> 1:02:15.305
If you interfere with
one of the queen ’s guards,

1:02:15.399 --> 1:02:18.015
I’m afraid I shall have
to arrest you, Agent Booth.

1:02:18.110 --> 1:02:20.066
Simmer down. I’m not doing
anything wrong here.

1:02:20.154 --> 1:02:23.146
- I’mjust waiting for
Lieutenant Ferry to go offduty.
- He did not murder Ian.

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:25.731
- How you know that?
- My colleagues at theJeffersonian...

1:02:25.826 --> 1:02:27.782
have discovered some
very compelling evidence.

1:02:27.870 --> 1:02:31.283
I imagine that you learned
that two of Wexler’s teammates
from Henley-on-Thames...

1:02:31.373 --> 1:02:33.785
abducted mm from the club
in order to sober h/m up
before a race.

1:02:33.876 --> 1:02:36.709
Then they told you
about his argument
and subsequent f/ght...

1:02:36.795 --> 1:02:41.038
with LieutenantJasper Ferry
here which Wexler lost after
a well-deserved head-butt.

1:02:41.133 --> 1:02:45.376
Why is everybody head-butting
everybody around here? What’s
wrong with a sock to thejaw?

1:02:45.471 --> 1:02:47.632
Well deserved?
Why well deserved?

1:02:47.723 --> 1:02:50.931
[Sighs] Ian was shagging
LieutenantJasper Ferry’s sister.

1:02:51.018 --> 1:02:53.930
Oh. How’d you
figure that out?

1:02:54.021 --> 1:02:56.888
A revolutionary technique
which consists ofasking
a series ofquestions...

1:02:56.982 --> 1:02:59.359
to a murder victim ’5 friends.

1:02:59.443 --> 1:03:02.401
Nonetheless,
I’m terribly impressed that
your scientists can deduce...

1:03:02.488 --> 1:03:04.729
almost as much
from a few particulates.

1:03:04.823 --> 1:03:06.779
Almost as much.

1:03:06.867 --> 1:03:09.609
Almost as much?

1:03:09.703 --> 1:03:12.365
Look, I’m sorry
about your sister.

1:03:13.874 --> 1:03:17.116
I really have to thank you.
That was excellent advice.

1:03:17.211 --> 1:03:19.293
You’re welcome.
It’s always best to be honest.

1:03:19.380 --> 1:03:22.463
Good. Then I can tell you
it was tough to take you
seriously at first.

1:03:22.549 --> 1:03:24.801
You don’t even look old enough
to drive, so I thought,

1:03:24.927 --> 1:03:28.090
“How could you possibly
have any valid insights?”
I have two doctorates.

1:03:28.180 --> 1:03:30.296
I know, but doctorates
don’t teach you
about sexual matters.

1:03:30.432 --> 1:03:32.718
And being so young, I—
I get it, Dr. Saroyan.

1:03:32.851 --> 1:03:34.807
I’mjust—
Being honest, I know.

1:03:34.895 --> 1:03:37.978
I’m just very grateful to you,
Dr. Sweets. That’s all.

1:03:38.065 --> 1:03:42.559
Dr. Hodgins, Scotland Yard
was interested in those other
particulates you’d found...

1:03:42.653 --> 1:03:44.484
that did not
indicate Henley.

1:03:44.571 --> 1:03:46.823
Okay, just— Okay.

1:03:46.907 --> 1:03:50.399
Okay. And, Angela,
I was wondering when you might
finish enhancing those photos.

1:03:50.494 --> 1:03:53.861
- Clark needs ’em.
- You’ll have them when they’re done.

1:03:53.956 --> 1:03:57.448
What do you think we’re doing?
Shirking our responsibility
or something?

1:03:57.543 --> 1:04:02.003
You know, we’ve been doing
an excellent job around here
even before you showed up,

1:04:02.089 --> 1:04:05.297
so regulate yourself, okay?

1:04:08.679 --> 1:04:11.921
I think maybe there’s still
a few unresolved issues.

1:04:15.978 --> 1:04:18.094
[Cate]
We’re still questioning
the female students.

1:04:18.188 --> 1:04:20.565
It seems that they’re
all accusing each other—

1:04:20.649 --> 1:04:23.311
you know, each one thinking that
they were special to Ian.

1:04:23.402 --> 1:04:26.860
Hmm. Is that
what you think too?

1:04:26.947 --> 1:04:28.983
You’ve been asking questions
ofyour own, I see.

1:04:29.074 --> 1:04:31.281
Apparently you were
sleeping with Dr. Wexler.

1:04:31.368 --> 1:04:34.576
Don ’t you think that
was something you should
have told us, Inspector?

1:04:34.663 --> 1:04:37.871
[Scoffs]
Oh, please.

1:04:37.958 --> 1:04:42.122
I’m British first, a cop second
and a woman third. It’s a miracle
it ever came to light.

1:04:42.212 --> 1:04:44.203
- For how long?
- Irrelevant.

1:04:44.298 --> 1:04:48.587
What you really want to know
is ifsharing Ian with other women
made me want to kill him.

1:04:48.677 --> 1:04:51.419
- Did it?
- All those
pretty young students?

1:04:51.513 --> 1:04:55.927
The thing that made Ian
so very, very good in bed
was all that practice.

1:04:58.395 --> 1:05:02.354
Sorry. Was that indiscreet?
I thought Americans were all
brash and forthright.

1:05:02.483 --> 1:05:05.975
[ Cell Phone Ringing]
I thought Brits were frustrated
sexually and repressed.

1:05:06.111 --> 1:05:08.898
Brennan.
[Saroyan]
We found something. You busy?

1:05:08.989 --> 1:05:12.072
- No, no, this is a fine time.
- Assuming the casts are accurate,

1:05:12.159 --> 1:05:16.277
I’ve isolated a stab wound that
originates between the sixth
and seventh thoracic vertebrae.

1:05:16.371 --> 1:05:19.238
- Which would have pierced
the lung and heart.
- [Clark] Most definitely.

1:05:19.333 --> 1:05:21.494
- That’s a very deep wound.
- Bones, what is it?

1:05:21.585 --> 1:05:24.247
Ian was stabbed to death.

1:05:24.338 --> 1:05:27.080
- A-And the weapon?
- Don’t know

1:05:27.216 --> 1:05:30.458
Maybe they found
something at the scene.
Nice work, Clark Thanks.

1:05:30.552 --> 1:05:35.672
Did you find any weapon
at Ian’s apartment that could
have been used to stab him?

1:05:35.766 --> 1:05:37.631
No. And I was there
the whole time.

1:05:39.812 --> 1:05:42.098
You’re doubting me.

1:05:42.189 --> 1:05:43.975
Yes.

1:05:44.942 --> 1:05:46.398
Wouldn’t you?

1:05:53.534 --> 1:05:55.490
[Brennan]
Inspector Pritchard?
Ijust wanted—

1:05:55.577 --> 1:05:58.284
I am not thejealous sort,
and you are painfully naive...

1:05:58.372 --> 1:06:02.206
ifyou think my sex life
was limited to Ian,
as I’m sure yours was not.

1:06:02.334 --> 1:06:04.916
I didn’t sleep
with Ian.
You didn’t?

1:06:05.045 --> 1:06:07.707
No.
Why not? You obviously
fancied each other.

1:06:07.798 --> 1:06:10.540
Yes, I noted several
physiological responses
to his presence,

1:06:10.634 --> 1:06:13.876
which can only be explained
by sexual attraction.

1:06:14.012 --> 1:06:17.175
So why didn’t you
sleep with him then?
Because of Booth.

1:06:17.266 --> 1:06:20.258
Oh, you know, I suspected
that you two might be
more thanjust partners.

1:06:20.352 --> 1:06:23.264
Oh, no. That’s incorrect.
Booth advised me
not to sleep with Ian,

1:06:23.355 --> 1:06:25.971
because Booth didn’t
want me to be another notch
on Ian’s bedpost.

1:06:26.066 --> 1:06:28.102
See, I rather saw
it as climbing Everest.

1:06:28.193 --> 1:06:32.152
Of course it’s been done before,
but the experience is still breathtaking.

1:06:32.239 --> 1:06:38.155
You have a strong sexual appetite
and you’re not hamstrung
by social moralizing.

1:06:38.245 --> 1:06:40.577
- I can empathize with that.
- Thank you.

1:06:40.664 --> 1:06:42.871
Why didn’t you tell us
you had a relationship
with Wexler?

1:06:42.958 --> 1:06:44.949
Because I thought
I’d be taken off the case.

1:06:45.043 --> 1:06:46.999
I mean, if Agent Booth
was murdered,

1:06:47.087 --> 1:06:51.205
wouldn’t you do everything
in your powers to make sure
that you found the killer?

1:06:51.300 --> 1:06:53.962
Yes, but I don’t sleep with Booth.

1:06:54.052 --> 1:06:56.919
Have you withheld
any other information?

1:06:57.014 --> 1:06:59.005
Why on earth would I do that?

1:06:59.099 --> 1:07:03.342
Because you called a meeting to
talk to us, then Clark called
to give us cause ofdeath,

1:07:03.437 --> 1:07:05.143
and then we basically
accused you ofmurder.

1:07:05.272 --> 1:07:07.513
[Alarm Chirps]
So while Booth
went to get our car,

1:07:07.608 --> 1:07:12.898
I followed you to your car, and
we began discussing mountain
climbing and sex with Ian—

1:07:12.988 --> 1:07:17.402
Yes, thank you, Dr. Brennan.
I believe I’m up to date now.
[Chuckles]

1:07:17.492 --> 1:07:20.279
Oh! You are absolutely right.

1:07:21.288 --> 1:07:23.904
I did forget to give you this.

1:07:23.999 --> 1:07:26.786
[Horns Honking ]

1:07:26.877 --> 1:07:30.210
Hmm. It’s a writ of release
on Frampton’s building site.

1:07:30.297 --> 1:07:34.006
The site has been certified
as having no historical
importance whatsoever.

1:07:34.092 --> 1:07:39.553
Signed and dated, Dr. Ian Wexler—
shortly before his death.

1:07:39.640 --> 1:07:43.428
This document would be worth
millions ofdollars to Frampton.

1:07:43.518 --> 1:07:45.600
I suggest that you and Agent Booth
ask Mr. Frampton...

1:07:45.687 --> 1:07:48.349
if he forced Ian to sign
that before killing him.

1:07:48.482 --> 1:07:51.019
Okay.
Oh.

1:07:51.109 --> 1:07:56.854
Word to the wise, Dr. Brennan.
I’d encourage you
not to forego Everest.

1:07:56.949 --> 1:07:59.816
Well, it’s too late.
Ian’s dead.

1:07:59.910 --> 1:08:01.992
Oh, yes, of course.

1:08:02.079 --> 1:08:05.162
To whom else
would I be referring
other than Ian?

1:08:09.586 --> 1:08:14.330
Me, kill Wex/er?
According to the papers,
the poor bastard died in a ﬁre.

1:08:14.424 --> 1:08:16.676
That wasn’t cause of death.
He was stabbed.

1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:19.877
We know that Dr. Wexler
stood in the way
of your latest project.

1:08:19.972 --> 1:08:23.840
He was checking the site
for historical value.
It’s the law.

1:08:23.934 --> 1:08:27.643
- Nothing stands in your way.
- Everything stands in my way,
Agent Booth.

1:08:27.729 --> 1:08:30.266
Environmental groups,
historical societies—

1:08:30.357 --> 1:08:33.895
You know, there’s even
a radical preservationist group.

1:08:33.986 --> 1:08:37.444
They threatened me
because / want
to improve the city.

1:08:38.949 --> 1:08:40.940
“Saviours of Antiquity.”
Hmm.

1:08:41.034 --> 1:08:45.778
I’d like to build a time machine,
take all these lunatics
and send them back...

1:08:45.872 --> 1:08:48.579
where there ’5 no
air-conditioning or TV.

1:08:48.667 --> 1:08:52.455
They can watch their loved ones die
from the ﬂu and the plague
because there ’5 no medicine.

1:08:52.546 --> 1:08:54.878
Then see how they like
the good old days.

1:08:54.965 --> 1:09:00.005
Right. Um, Dr. Wexler,
uh, signed the writ for
you to start building.

1:09:00.137 --> 1:09:02.173
Correct?
[Chuckles]

1:09:02.264 --> 1:09:04.255
Of course he did.

1:09:04.349 --> 1:09:07.682
He spent two years
rooting around in the dirt,
and all he got was dirty.

1:09:07.769 --> 1:09:11.728
We couldn’t help but notice
how recently Dr. Wexler
gave his okay for you to build.

1:09:11.815 --> 1:09:15.808
Sol guess the only question is,
how forceful did you
have to get with him?

1:09:15.902 --> 1:09:19.690
[Sighs]
I see.

1:09:19.781 --> 1:09:23.490
Yeah, so,
I was so inspired...

1:09:23.577 --> 1:09:26.944
by the sadistic murder
of my daughter...

1:09:27.039 --> 1:09:30.327
that / thought that / would
try one myself

1:09:30.417 --> 1:09:34.285
Ifthere’s nothing further,
I’m gonna get blind drunk.

1:09:38.050 --> 1:09:43.215
So, / found something very odd
that was on the vict/m—
mercury fu/mina te.

1:09:43.305 --> 1:09:45.887
I thought Carn was going to be
sending us all the results.

1:09:45.974 --> 1:09:48.306
I’m a grown-up.
I don’t need a middleman.

1:09:48.393 --> 1:09:50.770
Now, with this amount
of mercury, I’d think
he’d been poisoned, but...

1:09:50.896 --> 1:09:53.683
tox results say otherwise.
And it didn’t
come from Henley?

1:09:53.774 --> 1:09:58.017
Nope. I also found
phyllosilicate minerals
and carbonic acid.

1:09:58.111 --> 1:10:00.102
I’m not sure where
they came from either.

1:10:00.197 --> 1:10:02.654
Hey, can you have them send me
more samples from the remains,

1:10:02.783 --> 1:10:05.866
and the locations from
which they came on the body?
Of course.

1:10:05.952 --> 1:10:10.070
But Scotland Yard says that
all requests have to come
through Dr. Saroyan.

1:10:10.165 --> 1:10:13.453
Right, ’cause nothing could
possibly happen without her.

1:10:13.585 --> 1:10:16.748
Is everything okay,
Hodgins?
Yep, sure, fine.

1:10:16.838 --> 1:10:20.456
I’ll have our all-powerful leader
send the request.

1:10:20.550 --> 1:10:22.632
[Beeps]

1:10:24.554 --> 1:10:27.170
Thank you all for coming.
Cam sa/d we had to.

1:10:27.265 --> 1:10:29.802
- Or lose ourjobs.
- For insubordination.

1:10:29.893 --> 1:10:32.851
Oh, I was kind of hoping that
you all came ofyour own volition...

1:10:32.938 --> 1:10:35.429
with an eye to ward
ameliorating a tense situa tion.

1:10:35.565 --> 1:10:38.307
Can’t youjust tell her
not to be so bossy?
I’m your boss.

1:10:38.402 --> 1:10:42.771
It’s ven/ rmportant to realize
that Dr. Saroyan has done
nothing to merit your anger—

1:10:42.864 --> 1:10:45.321
- Thank you.
- as a boss.

1:10:45.409 --> 1:10:48.617
But by sexualizing her relationship
with Mr. Barasa—

1:10:48.703 --> 1:10:52.070
- Is there no better way to put that?
- Everything else sounds worse.

1:10:52.165 --> 1:10:55.282
She’s made you both confront
unresolved feelings...

1:10:55.377 --> 1:10:59.245
about Mr. Barasa’s impact on your lives
and how he affects your relationship.

1:10:59.339 --> 1:11:02.251
Angela and I love each other
and are getting married.

1:11:02.342 --> 1:11:05.755
I know. Why did you think
I was questioning that?

1:11:05.846 --> 1:11:09.680
l ook, shrinky,
don ’t go making problems
where there aren ’t any, okay?

1:11:09.766 --> 1:11:12.929
Although, the next time
that you drive somebody
to the airport...

1:11:13.019 --> 1:11:14.930
/ust let them ﬂy
the hell out of Dodge, okay?

1:11:15.021 --> 1:11:17.763
This all would have been a lot easier
if I’d kept my mouth shut.

1:11:17.858 --> 1:11:20.565
No. Nonsense.
You’re all friends.

1:11:20.652 --> 1:11:24.440
I’m sure now that you see
the situation for what it is,
you’ll know how to move through it.

1:11:24.573 --> 1:11:27.406
Am I right?
I think Dad
wants us to apologize.

1:11:29.202 --> 1:11:31.318
I apologize for...

1:11:32.330 --> 1:11:34.286
sleeping with people.

1:11:34.374 --> 1:11:39.960
I apologize for snapping at you
after basically giving you
permission to sleep with people.

1:11:40.046 --> 1:11:42.458
Oh, God!

1:11:42.549 --> 1:11:44.585
So now everything is fine?

1:11:44.676 --> 1:11:49.636
That is the result ofopen
and honest communication
with a highly trained mediator.

1:11:49.723 --> 1:11:51.463
[ Hodgins S rghs ]
Fine.

1:11:51.558 --> 1:11:55.142
I am sorry for being so cranky—

1:11:55.228 --> 1:11:58.516
which is my basic personality,
so it seems stupid to apologize—

1:11:58.648 --> 1:12:01.390
Hodgins, would youjust—
I apologize.

1:12:11.328 --> 1:12:13.319
[Vera]
Dr. Wexler never said one word...

1:12:13.413 --> 1:12:15.495
about giving Frampton the okay
to build condos here.

1:12:15.582 --> 1:12:18.790
[Booth ] Well, he signed
a writ saying this place
had no historical value.

1:12:18.877 --> 1:12:22.461
I’m stunned, I tell you.
The writ must be a forgery.

1:12:22.547 --> 1:12:25.710
After two years, you hadn’t
found anything. I think that’s
a reasonable timeline.

1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:28.257
This says we have to vacate
the dig in two days.

1:12:28.345 --> 1:12:31.212
But Dr. Wexler felt certain
we were close.

1:12:31.306 --> 1:12:33.843
There was a previous Bronze Age
find about 600 meters south.

1:12:33.934 --> 1:12:36.175
- That’s his signature, right?
- I don’t care. He wouldn’t do it.

1:12:36.311 --> 1:12:38.427
Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan.
Yeah?

1:12:38.522 --> 1:12:40.604
Got these from our
forensic accountant.

1:12:40.690 --> 1:12:43.523
Wow, look at that.
Some checks
made out to Wexler.

1:12:43.610 --> 1:12:46.101
Ten of them
from a shell company
0 wned by Frampton.

1:12:46.196 --> 1:12:51.736
Seems that 25, 000 pounds was
the going rate fora piss-broke
forensic anthropologist.

1:12:51.826 --> 1:12:54.078
That’s how he paid off his debts.

1:12:54.162 --> 1:12:56.574
Frampton bribed Ian
to vacate the dig.

1:13:01.628 --> 1:13:05.246
[ Hodgins ] They found
traces of mercury fu/mina te
in the lo wer extremities,

1:13:05.340 --> 1:13:07.422
higher concentration
on the patellas...

1:13:07.509 --> 1:13:09.875
and the greatest was
where he was stabbed.

1:13:09.970 --> 1:13:12.461
- So it was on the murder weapon.
- Yeah, it looks that way.

1:13:12.597 --> 1:13:14.838
Any idea what kind
of weapon it was?
No, not yet.

1:13:14.933 --> 1:13:17.345
Whatever punctured the bone
was rough, like a stick.

1:13:17.435 --> 1:13:21.724
And I’ve tried knives, awls, picks,
but nothing matches.

1:13:21.815 --> 1:13:23.931
Who would use mercury fulminate?

1:13:24.025 --> 1:13:27.938
It’s used in neon lights, batteries,
by taxidermists and at tanneries,

1:13:28.029 --> 1:13:29.894
and in the manufacture
of explosives.

1:13:29.990 --> 1:13:32.777
Frampton has different companies.
Maybe one of them uses mercury fulminate.

1:13:32.909 --> 1:13:35.901
Yeah, I’ll see what he owns.
I’ll look for any instruments
found in those fields...

1:13:35.996 --> 1:13:38.282
that could be used as a weapon.

1:13:40.041 --> 1:13:42.123
Ah, look at that,
Bones, huh?

1:13:42.210 --> 1:13:46.499
I’m not saying that
we should have a king or a queen
or beheadings and all thatjazz.

1:13:46.590 --> 1:13:51.380
I’m just saying, you know,
calling someone, like, uh—
hey— Sir Seeley Booth?

1:13:51.511 --> 1:13:54.878
Now, that is civilized.
Oh, what makes you think
that you would be knighted?

1:13:54.973 --> 1:13:57.680
Come on.
You’re serious, right? Please.

1:13:57.809 --> 1:14:01.643
Well, look at this.
You two seem to be relaxing.
Yeah, I’m gettin’ into it.

1:14:01.730 --> 1:14:05.268
My head is feeling a little bit clearer,
as chaotic as the English can be.

1:14:05.358 --> 1:14:08.441
So, Pritch, tell me.
You think I got what it takes
to be a knight, right?

1:14:08.570 --> 1:14:11.312
That’s not your
first pint, is it?
No.

1:14:11.406 --> 1:14:13.738
Did you bring
information on the case?

1:14:13.825 --> 1:14:17.613
I ran some checks on Saviours
ofAntiquity. Last year, they were
suspects in the bombing...

1:14:17.704 --> 1:14:20.912
of a new construction built
on the site of a 73th-century
church in Ba yswater.

1:14:21.041 --> 1:14:23.373
Burnt it to the ground
Mercury fulminate.

1:14:23.460 --> 1:14:27.294
- I’m sorry?
- Used to manufacture explosives.

1:14:27.380 --> 1:14:31.123
The residue would be on
the bomb makers and could have been
transferred to Ian’s stab wound.

1:14:31.217 --> 1:14:35.051
Well, only two other members
ofthe group were charged.
Others were released.

1:14:35.138 --> 1:14:38.426
- Look who they let go.
- Cyril.

1:14:38.516 --> 1:14:43.351
Yeah, who would be
very angry that Wexler
sold out the dig.

1:14:43.438 --> 1:14:47.056
I’m telling you, I/era,
there’s nothing more to be
done there. It’s shut down.

1:14:47.192 --> 1:14:50.935
A week, maybe 10 days
to clean up, and it’s over.
So suddenly after two years?

1:14:51.071 --> 1:14:54.188
[Booth] Hey, Vera, Dr. Brennan
wants you in the lab.
[Cyril] What, not me?

1:14:54.282 --> 1:14:57.649
[Cate]
No, Cyril. Dr. Brennan
wants you to tell us about this.

1:14:57.744 --> 1:15:01.612
- Saviours ofAntiquity? Please!
- Where were you on the night
that Dr. Ian Wexler died?

1:15:01.706 --> 1:15:05.119
- You can’t be serious.
- Cyril finds out his professor
is on the take and kills him.

1:15:05.210 --> 1:15:07.326
I was in Wales,
visiting my parents.

1:15:07.420 --> 1:15:10.833
- Cyril quit the Saviours years ago.
- I joined mostly to meet women.

1:15:10.924 --> 1:15:12.789
I’m not a fanatic.

1:15:12.884 --> 1:15:15.000
Call my mum. Ask her.

1:15:15.095 --> 1:15:17.211
Uh, we ate eel.
It’s my favorite dish.

1:15:24.270 --> 1:15:26.556
[Door Closes]

1:15:26.648 --> 1:15:30.357
[Grunting]
You think they ever made
a Frankenstein in this place?

1:15:30.443 --> 1:15:33.310
No, Frankenstein
was the doctor,
not the monster.

1:15:33.405 --> 1:15:36.021
Yeah, ’cause
the other way around,
that would make no sense.

1:15:36.116 --> 1:15:38.903
- Bones, Iknow that look
- Me too.

1:15:38.993 --> 1:15:42.736
Whenever Ian had that look,
it meant that things had
just gotten more complicated.

1:15:42.831 --> 1:15:44.662
Clarkjust got
the last ofthe casts,

1:15:44.749 --> 1:15:47.832
and while he was finishing
reconstructing the skeleton...

1:15:47.919 --> 1:15:49.784
he found an extra bone.

1:15:49.879 --> 1:15:52.040
- Wexler had an extra bone?
- No, no.

1:15:52.132 --> 1:15:56.876
It’s a shattered section
ofa femur from someone else
that the interns here didn’t identify.

1:15:56.970 --> 1:16:00.087
Every piece of bone
you have here was found
and cataloged at the scene.

1:16:00.181 --> 1:16:03.423
Well, maybe he held on to it.
Bone people like to hold on to bones.

1:16:03.518 --> 1:16:06.351
I think it’s the murder weapon.

1:16:06.438 --> 1:16:10.681
- Seriously?
- The entry point ofthe stab
wound is between T6 and T7,

1:16:10.775 --> 1:16:15.565
extending approximately
22 centimeters through
the heart and lungs.

1:16:15.655 --> 1:16:18.397
The killer used a bone
to stab Ian.

1:16:18.491 --> 1:16:22.734
Live by the bone, die by the bone.
It’s— Sorry.

1:16:22.829 --> 1:16:27.368
It occurs to me that ifwe find
the origin ofthe bone, then,
well, we find the murderer.

1:16:27.459 --> 1:16:29.541
That’s where
the mercury comes in.

1:16:29.627 --> 1:16:32.585
This bone displays very high
levels of mercury fulminate.

1:16:32.672 --> 1:16:35.414
- What does that mean, Bones?
- Nothing.
- That’s very useful.

1:16:35.508 --> 1:16:37.794
I’m more interested in
the fact that it’s ossified.

1:16:37.886 --> 1:16:39.797
That basically means
it’s turned to stone.

1:16:39.888 --> 1:16:42.254
No, no. Don’t you start
explaining things to me now.

1:16:42.348 --> 1:16:44.430
What is the significance
ofthat?

1:16:44.517 --> 1:16:46.974
It means it’s over
2,000 years old.

1:16:47.061 --> 1:16:50.224
I was already working
at the top of my game
knowing “ossified.”

1:16:50.315 --> 1:16:53.853
2,000 years old
puts this bone firmly
in the Bronze Age.

1:16:53.943 --> 1:16:56.275
- The site.
- Oh, my God.

1:16:56.362 --> 1:16:58.944
So this bone alone would have
prevented Frampton...

1:16:59.073 --> 1:17:00.574
from building his skyscrapers.
Yes.

1:17:00.658 --> 1:17:02.944
Perhaps the murderer
used it to kill Ian...

1:17:03.036 --> 1:17:06.574
as a kind of symbolic revenge
for signing the writ.

1:17:06.664 --> 1:17:08.746
- That makes sense.
- No, it doesn’t make sense.

1:17:08.833 --> 1:17:11.870
Nobodyjust kills somebody
with a bone symbolically,
not even in England.

1:17:11.961 --> 1:17:14.873
- So, what then, Agent Booth?
- You have the fire, the cigarette—

1:17:14.964 --> 1:17:18.673
It was all set out of panic.
The killer didn’t act symbolically.

1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:21.877
He acted out of rage.

1:17:26.559 --> 1:17:29.892
Sweets is actually good at his job.

1:17:29.979 --> 1:17:34.313
I know, right? I mean,
did you understand you
weren’t actually mad at Cam?

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:37.688
No, actually, I was mad at her.

1:17:37.779 --> 1:17:40.646
I mean, you don’t have sex
with someone and then expect
everything to be fine.

1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:43.948
Yeah, not when they’re
supposed to be gone and out
ofour lives. That is not fine.

1:17:44.035 --> 1:17:45.866
No, it definitely is not.

1:17:45.954 --> 1:17:50.448
Why? You’re divorced.
Why aren’t you fine with
Cam sleeping with him?

1:17:50.542 --> 1:17:54.376
Well, for the same reason
you aren’t fine with him
still being in town.

1:17:54.462 --> 1:17:58.922
But if everything’s over
with him, wh— why do you
care who he sleeps with?

1:17:59.008 --> 1:18:01.966
Why do you care
that he’s still in town?

1:18:02.053 --> 1:18:05.762
- I don’t care.
- Obviously you do.

1:18:05.849 --> 1:18:10.138
Ifyou were 100% certain of me,
you wouldn’t care. But you do.

1:18:10.228 --> 1:18:15.473
Ifyou were 100% certain you
didn’t want him, you wouldn’t
care that Carn slept with him.

1:18:21.489 --> 1:18:23.320
You don’t trust me.

1:18:26.995 --> 1:18:30.954
Saying that means
you don’t trust me.
[Scoffs]

1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:33.452
How can two people who
don’t trust each get married?

1:18:33.543 --> 1:18:38.003
- I thought we did trust each other.
- Yeah, I did too.

1:18:40.133 --> 1:18:42.499
Two people who don’t trust each other
shouldn’t be together at all.

1:18:42.594 --> 1:18:46.587
- You really think that?
- Don’t you?

1:18:48.308 --> 1:18:51.800
I mean, yeah, I-I do. I mean,
I actually do think that, but—

1:18:55.523 --> 1:18:57.900
Oh, my God

1:18:57.984 --> 1:18:59.975
Yeah.

1:19:00.069 --> 1:19:01.934
I don’t know what happened.

1:19:03.364 --> 1:19:05.195
I don’t either.

1:19:07.243 --> 1:19:09.575
But I know it did happen.

1:19:11.456 --> 1:19:14.493
I’m gonna— I’m gonna go.

1:19:17.086 --> 1:19:19.748
You know, all you had to do
was trust me.

1:19:19.839 --> 1:19:23.206
Hey, you’re the one
that’s leaving.

1:19:24.594 --> 1:19:27.176
You’re the one
who isn’t stopping me.

1:19:31.142 --> 1:19:32.882
[Whispers]
Yeah.

1:19:44.113 --> 1:19:46.604
Dr. Wexler would have told us
about a find this important.

1:19:46.699 --> 1:19:49.031
Yeah, unless he wanted
to keep the money.

1:19:49.118 --> 1:19:53.737
- Dr. Brennan, why are we here?
- This was farmland,
a stable for over 200 years.

1:19:53.873 --> 1:19:57.081
Oh, in the 18th
and 19th centuries. So?
No mercury.

1:19:57.168 --> 1:20:01.002
But in the 17th century,
there was an inn over there...

1:20:01.089 --> 1:20:03.421
and a tannery right there.

1:20:03.508 --> 1:20:05.749
One ofthe oldest tanneries
in Kensington.

1:20:05.843 --> 1:20:07.879
Oh, my God.
What?

1:20:08.012 --> 1:20:10.389
That’s right.
Mercury fulminate.
It’s used in tanning.

1:20:10.473 --> 1:20:12.885
The tannery was here
for over a hundred years.

1:20:12.976 --> 1:20:15.467
Mercury would have seeped
into the 50/7 and contaminated
whatever it touched

1:20:15.603 --> 1:20:18.265
Why is this area covered?
Vera, you supervised
that part ofthe dig.

1:20:18.356 --> 1:20:21.143
Nothing was found there.
Dr. Wexler told us to move on.

1:20:21.234 --> 1:20:24.567
Booth, will you help me?
Yeah, I got it.

1:20:30.618 --> 1:20:32.734
This soil should be loose
from the excavation.

1:20:32.870 --> 1:20:35.657
It’s been packed down.
[Cate]
Covered by wooden palettes.

1:20:35.748 --> 1:20:38.535
- Vera, what’s going on?
- Nothing. I told you.

1:20:38.626 --> 1:20:41.368
Dr. Wexler instructed me
to move on.

1:20:41.462 --> 1:20:45.705
- Another ossified bone chip.
This is a Bronze Age site.
- You live for this.

1:20:45.842 --> 1:20:48.709
Why’cl you coverit up?
I didn’t do anything.
Cyril, tell them.

1:20:48.803 --> 1:20:53.137
We’ve been working together
two years trying to make this ﬁnd

1:20:53.224 --> 1:20:56.933
The bone had no hilt.
She would’ve scraped her palm
ifshe stabbed him.

1:20:58.187 --> 1:21:00.439
[Scoffs]
You two are very, very good.

1:21:00.523 --> 1:21:02.809
We ’re the best.

1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:06.142
- Goodjob, Bones.
Come on. Up you go, Vera.
- You don’t understand.

1:21:06.237 --> 1:21:09.900
- Have some cuffs, please?
- You don’t understand
what Ian wanted to do.

1:21:09.991 --> 1:21:12.198
You kill Wexler
so you could keep
the money for yourself?

1:21:12.285 --> 1:21:15.368
- Ian wanted to give the money back.
Don’t you understand?
- Not at all.

1:21:15.455 --> 1:21:17.616
/ ’m afra/d/ do.
It was Ian through and through.

1:21:17.707 --> 1:21:21.416
He happily accepted
the bribe money when there
was no reason to be br/bed

1:21:21.502 --> 1:21:25.245
But the minute they found
something, he got all noble
and princ/pled and—

1:21:25.339 --> 1:21:27.170
and wanted to return the money.

1:21:29.844 --> 1:21:33.302
- It’d have ruined his career.
- And mine too. Don’t you see?

1:21:33.389 --> 1:21:37.257
- He never thought ofthat.
- So, Ian was a good man really?

1:21:37.351 --> 1:21:40.718
A relatively good man—
[Sighs]

1:21:40.813 --> 1:21:42.678
which was good enough
for some of us.

1:21:50.448 --> 1:21:53.281
[Brennan on Message Machine]
Technical/y, you have not
reached Temperance Brennan.

1:21:53.367 --> 1:21:57.406
But /f you leave a message,
it will reach her— me—
Temperance Brennan.

1:21:57.538 --> 1:22:01.497
[ Line Beeps]
Hey, sweetie, it’s me.

1:22:01.584 --> 1:22:05.918
Hodgins and I broke up, and,
uh, I won’t really know why
until I speak to you.

1:22:06.005 --> 1:22:10.669
So I’mjust gonna crawl
into bed until you get home,
and then we can—

1:22:13.513 --> 1:22:15.674
[Phone Beeps]

1:22:17.517 --> 1:22:19.599
Angela.

1:22:19.685 --> 1:22:23.052
Oh, God.
[Chuckles]
You again.

1:22:23.147 --> 1:22:27.106
I heard you broke up
with the small angry man.

1:22:27.193 --> 1:22:30.560
So before I leave,
I want to ask you one more time.

1:22:30.655 --> 1:22:34.614
No. No one gets me.

1:22:34.700 --> 1:22:36.531
I’m nobody’s.

1:22:38.412 --> 1:22:43.372
I understand. Perhaps you can
drive me to the airport?

1:22:43.459 --> 1:22:46.997
That’s some kind of code
for you, isn’t it?

1:22:47.088 --> 1:22:49.079
Maybe I should take him.

1:22:49.173 --> 1:22:52.381
No. I’ll take him.

1:22:52.510 --> 1:22:56.879
What’s this?
Look, it’s been very
interesting working here.

1:22:56.973 --> 1:23:00.261
But I’m a man of science,
and this place isjust—

1:23:00.351 --> 1:23:03.309
- It’s very dramatic.
- Well said.

1:23:03.396 --> 1:23:07.059
I just want to work
in a regular lab, you know?

1:23:07.191 --> 1:23:10.274
So you want that ride or not?
Yes, he does.

1:23:12.363 --> 1:23:14.274
[Sighs]

1:23:22.665 --> 1:23:25.031
[Sighs]

1:23:27.253 --> 1:23:30.495
You know, Wexler was
kind of like a Robin Hood
kind ofa character—

1:23:30.631 --> 1:23:35.091
steal from the rich.
I turned down my chance
to sleep with Robin Hood?

1:23:35.178 --> 1:23:37.294
Sometimes you just
take the oddest leap.

1:23:37.388 --> 1:23:40.926
Hey, Pritch.
[ British A ccent ]
C heerio, mate.

1:23:41.017 --> 1:23:44.100
[Chuckles]
“Hello” is fine.

1:23:44.187 --> 1:23:47.520
On behalf of Her Majesty
the Queen of England,

1:23:47.607 --> 1:23:49.893
I dub you Sir Seeley Booth,

1:23:49.984 --> 1:23:53.693
[Knife C latters ]
Knight of the Realm.

1:23:54.614 --> 1:23:55.774
Wow.

1:23:59.285 --> 1:24:01.526
“Ofﬂcra/ junior Knight. ”

1:24:01.621 --> 1:24:05.364
Eh? Look at that. Wait a second.
That’s from a toy store.

1:24:05.458 --> 1:24:08.245
It doesn’t mean
you’re not Sir Galahad.

1:24:08.336 --> 1:24:10.748
Thanks.

1:24:12.381 --> 1:24:14.121
I’m sorry about Ian.

1:24:16.052 --> 1:24:18.259
Me too.

1:24:18.346 --> 1:24:20.678
It was a real honor
working with you both.

1:24:20.765 --> 1:24:23.472
Same here.

1:24:25.311 --> 1:24:28.098
Ifyou need a lift
to the airport—

1:24:28.189 --> 1:24:31.602
- Bones— She got us a limo.
- Of course.

1:24:36.572 --> 1:24:38.483
It would be lovely.

1:24:42.036 --> 1:24:43.822
[ Pats Knee]
She likes you.

1:24:43.955 --> 1:24:48.324
No.
Yes!
And she’s very sexual.

1:24:48.417 --> 1:24:51.659
Enough. It’sjust—
[Laughs] Stop.

1:24:51.754 --> 1:24:54.120
I’m gonna miss this place.

1:24:54.215 --> 1:24:57.423
,U‘ [Man Singing Pop]

1:24:57.510 --> 1:24:59.842
This is definitely not a diner.

1:25:02.223 --> 1:25:05.215
Come on. We should go before
someone else gets killed.
Yeah, you’re right.

1:25:05.309 --> 1:25:07.300
[Clears Throat]
Here we go. Oh!

1:25:08.396 --> 1:25:11.729
My arm?
Thank you.

1:25:11.857 --> 1:25:14.143
Thank you, Sir Seeley.
Ah.

1:25:14.235 --> 1:25:17.398
[British Accent]
Pleasure, Lady Temperance.

1:25:17.530 --> 1:25:22.115
[Laughing]
You sound Australian.
I don’t sound Australian.

,r love don ’t stand ,r

1:25:24.996 --> 1:25:26.952
It’s definitely not English.

,rA ghost of a chance ,rJ

1:26:15.212 --> 1:26:16.588
What’s that mean?
