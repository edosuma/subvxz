WEBVTT

00:05.403 --> 00:08.738
I can't believe this is our last
evening together.

00:08.774 --> 00:10.740
Hey, there's nothing
last about this.

00:10.776 --> 00:12.576
You know what I mean.

00:12.611 --> 00:14.143
It'll be a quick four years.

00:14.179 --> 00:16.079
At Duke, maybe while
I'm at culinary school,

00:16.114 --> 00:17.380
but then what?

00:17.415 --> 00:19.048
Well, let's see.

00:19.084 --> 00:19.749
I'll come back here,

00:19.785 --> 00:20.750
I'll come back to Indian Lake,

00:20.786 --> 00:22.886
figure out how to use
my degree and you'll-

00:22.921 --> 00:25.555
Convince Mr. Wilson to sell me
the old creamery?

00:25.591 --> 00:28.091
Once he tries your cupcakes
he won't be able to say no.

00:28.126 --> 00:29.425
That's the hope.

00:29.461 --> 00:32.161
And we'll get married, here,
at the lake.

00:32.197 --> 00:33.262
In the evening?

00:33.298 --> 00:35.298
Have three kids.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.233
I love it.

00:37.268 --> 00:39.102
It's the perfect plan.

00:41.172 --> 00:43.507
Maddie, some people go their
whole lives waiting to find

00:43.542 --> 00:46.175
that one person that they wanna
grow old with.

00:46.211 --> 00:48.411
I just got lucky and found
you now.

00:48.446 --> 00:50.279
Me too.

00:54.786 --> 00:56.152
What's this?

00:56.187 --> 00:58.121
It's my promise.

01:02.293 --> 01:04.260
It's beautiful.

01:04.295 --> 01:07.196
See? You can't get rid of me
that easily.

01:11.069 --> 01:13.403
Good.

01:20.746 --> 01:25.048
I slaved over these all day
so you better be hungry.

01:25.083 --> 01:26.550
Chocolate velvet?

01:26.585 --> 01:27.951
And you didn't even let me help.

01:27.986 --> 01:29.986
I had to send you off
with your favorite.

01:30.889 --> 01:39.596
â™ª

01:39.631 --> 01:41.197
I love you, Maddie.

01:41.232 --> 01:42.666
I always will.

01:42.701 --> 01:44.668
I love you, too.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.778 --> 03:00.710
[knocking]

03:00.746 --> 03:03.947
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

03:03.982 --> 03:04.948
So?

03:04.983 --> 03:05.949
What do you think?

03:05.984 --> 03:07.117
Too sweet?

03:07.152 --> 03:08.251
Not sweet enough?

03:08.286 --> 03:09.452
This one may be my favorite.

03:09.487 --> 03:10.586
Really?

03:10.622 --> 03:11.521
Because I wasn't sure if
I should bring it out today

03:11.556 --> 03:13.923
but I really wanna showcase
something new.

03:13.959 --> 03:15.058
Relax.

03:15.093 --> 03:16.926
You are going to be great.

03:16.962 --> 03:19.963
Well, if not it's back to baking
in my kitchen again.

03:19.998 --> 03:22.866
Thank you, again, for setting up
this meeting with the banker.

03:22.901 --> 03:24.901
I love my little cafe
but it's not gonna make it

03:24.936 --> 03:26.235
if we can't expand.

03:26.271 --> 03:27.871
Especially with everything
starting to break.

03:27.906 --> 03:31.474
Well, my cousin said as far
as investment bankers go

03:31.509 --> 03:33.476
he's a real rising star.

03:33.511 --> 03:37.647
She also said he is
very handsome and single.

03:37.683 --> 03:39.716
[laughs]

03:39.751 --> 03:42.652
Thank you, Emma, but I think
I'll just focus on saving

03:42.688 --> 03:46.622
my business for now,
if that's ok.

03:47.592 --> 03:48.591
Oh, shoot!

03:48.626 --> 03:49.559
I gotta go.

03:49.594 --> 03:50.960
Thank you.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.567
Delicious.

03:59.004 --> 04:01.037
Mmm, mmm.

04:28.834 --> 04:32.035
Ok, cupcakes are out,
business plan is printed,

04:32.070 --> 04:35.438
and why does that
not sound good?

04:35.473 --> 04:36.806
It's choking out a lot of steam.

04:36.842 --> 04:38.341
Is it still making good coffee?

04:38.376 --> 04:39.175
For now.

04:39.211 --> 04:40.610
Let's just focus on that today,
ok?

04:40.645 --> 04:41.510
Well, what about the oven?

04:41.546 --> 04:42.545
What about it?

04:42.580 --> 04:43.980
Last night's batch cooked
quicker than usual.

04:44.015 --> 04:45.849
What if things start to burn?

04:45.884 --> 04:47.784
Ok, I know the cafe
needs an overhaul

04:47.819 --> 04:48.618
and hopefully today's meeting

04:48.653 --> 04:50.486
will get us one step
closer to that,

04:50.521 --> 04:53.990
but today let's just focus
on quality.

04:54.025 --> 04:55.058
That's what we're selling.

04:55.093 --> 05:00.196
The rest is just logistics.

05:01.199 --> 05:02.165
What are these?

05:02.200 --> 05:04.567
Our new sugar cookie cake
with brown butter,

05:04.602 --> 05:07.637
rosemary, and pine nut frosting.

05:07.672 --> 05:08.805
You made these last night?

05:08.840 --> 05:10.206
Mmmhmm.

05:14.612 --> 05:17.380
Mmm.

05:17.415 --> 05:18.481
How do you do it?

05:18.516 --> 05:19.515
Do what?

05:19.550 --> 05:20.349
Make me feel better?

05:20.385 --> 05:22.152
Oh, it's not me,
it's the cupcake.

05:22.187 --> 05:25.554
And the fresh rosemary.

05:25.590 --> 05:27.590
[sighs]
Alright.

05:27.625 --> 05:29.959
Now, let's make a deal.

05:33.698 --> 05:36.732
So originally this was one space
so we won't lose any character

05:36.768 --> 05:37.934
by opening it up.

05:37.969 --> 05:41.070
We're just gonna gain more
seating and catering and just...

05:41.106 --> 05:42.005
everything.

05:42.040 --> 05:42.705
Well, from what you told me
on the phone

05:42.740 --> 05:45.041
this is exactly what I pictured.

05:45.076 --> 05:46.910
Small town, charming...

05:46.945 --> 05:48.778
it's a very different feel
from Chicago.

05:48.814 --> 05:52.182
Well, we really appreciate you
coming all the way out here.

05:52.217 --> 05:54.050
It's only an hour away.

05:55.153 --> 05:57.386
And I am glad I came in person.

05:57.422 --> 05:59.122
The space is really unique.

05:59.157 --> 06:01.624
Yeah, I fell in love
with all these details

06:01.659 --> 06:03.559
and I wanted to create cupcakes

06:03.594 --> 06:05.461
that would capture
that same feeling.

06:05.496 --> 06:07.730
And I grew up around here
so I know all the shop owners,

06:07.765 --> 06:09.699
which is always really nice.

06:09.734 --> 06:10.733
Is your family still here?

06:10.768 --> 06:11.734
No, no.

06:11.769 --> 06:14.137
Actually they moved to Florida
a few years ago,

06:14.172 --> 06:17.140
but I- I never really wanted
to live anywhere else.

06:17.175 --> 06:17.974
Hmm.

06:18.009 --> 06:19.108
You know, actually,
this is um...

06:19.144 --> 06:20.109
this is the old creamery

06:20.145 --> 06:21.811
where my grandparents had
their first date.

06:21.847 --> 06:24.480
And since my grandmother taught
me everything she knows

06:24.515 --> 06:28.818
about baking it just...
well, it seemed perfect.

06:28.854 --> 06:30.920
I think we can use that.

06:30.956 --> 06:31.888
Use it? How?

06:31.923 --> 06:33.756
Well, if someone wants to invest
in your cafe

06:33.791 --> 06:35.091
they're gonna wanna know
that you've been doing this

06:35.126 --> 06:36.292
for a long time.

06:36.328 --> 06:37.660
That it's not just
some passing phase

06:37.695 --> 06:39.628
and you're really invested
in being here.

06:39.664 --> 06:41.464
Well, I guess I'm lucky
in that respect.

06:41.499 --> 06:44.400
I've known what I wanted
to do since forever.

06:44.435 --> 06:46.169
Now, I just gotta keep going.

06:46.204 --> 06:49.739
Well, gourmet and made-to-order
cupcakes this good?

06:49.774 --> 06:51.140
I don't think you'll have
a problem.

06:51.176 --> 06:53.409
Well, we will if the oven
keeps quitting on us,

06:53.444 --> 06:55.845
but the space is just
too limited to get ahead

06:55.881 --> 06:57.446
or even just repair.

06:57.482 --> 06:59.448
So why not a simple
business loan?

06:59.484 --> 07:03.353
Because I've already taken out
too many loans to get this far.

07:03.388 --> 07:06.356
I know that, but the investors
don't have to.

07:06.391 --> 07:09.759
You start with passion,
build in potential.

07:09.794 --> 07:11.928
Passion she can do.

07:11.963 --> 07:12.795
[chuckles]

07:12.830 --> 07:15.164
And a cute grandma
story never hurt.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.266
Ok.

07:16.301 --> 07:17.767
So- so where do we go from here?

07:17.802 --> 07:18.868
I gotta run some numbers,

07:18.904 --> 07:21.504
contact a few people and see
if anybody's interested.

07:21.539 --> 07:22.638
How's that sound?

07:22.673 --> 07:24.173
That sounds perfect.

07:24.209 --> 07:25.174
Great.

07:25.210 --> 07:26.142
Oh, wait!

07:26.177 --> 07:27.810
Um, don't forget your samples.

07:27.845 --> 07:29.545
One of every flavor.

07:29.580 --> 07:31.981
How could I?

07:35.853 --> 07:36.786
I don't want to jinx it

07:36.821 --> 07:39.555
but I think that went really
well, don't you?

07:39.590 --> 07:40.456
What?

07:40.491 --> 07:42.025
Oh, nothing.

07:42.060 --> 07:44.294
From a business perspective.

07:44.329 --> 07:45.161
Mmmhmm.

07:45.196 --> 07:45.962
Ok, you know what?

07:45.997 --> 07:47.196
You and your whole
passion comment.

07:47.232 --> 07:48.864
Get back to work.

07:57.675 --> 07:59.842
Do we really want it snowing
at our wedding?

07:59.877 --> 08:01.577
Ah, just...
spring is really soon

08:01.612 --> 08:03.913
and summer's my busy season,
so...

08:03.949 --> 08:07.216
<i>But snow? It's just not</i>
<i>what I imagined.</i>

08:07.252 --> 08:08.918
<i>I know.</i>

08:08.954 --> 08:09.752
Hi.

08:09.787 --> 08:10.653
Sorry I'm late.

08:10.688 --> 08:13.923
I had to get the oven
looked at again.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.091
Oh, well, don't worry.

08:15.126 --> 08:16.326
You're not even two minutes late

08:16.361 --> 08:20.163
and I still haven't decided if
I'm having a salad or a burger.

08:20.198 --> 08:21.097
Oh no.

08:21.132 --> 08:22.865
Don't tell me you're doing
the no carb diet

08:22.900 --> 08:24.367
now that you're engaged.

08:24.402 --> 08:28.371
Well, considering we haven't set
a date yet, no.

08:28.406 --> 08:30.373
And even when we do, no.

08:30.408 --> 08:31.174
Ok.

08:31.209 --> 08:33.376
It's just I don't wanna
rush this.

08:36.246 --> 08:38.514
Let me rephrase that.

08:38.549 --> 08:41.784
I just- I don't want to rush
the perfect day.

08:41.818 --> 08:43.086
How's that?

08:43.121 --> 08:44.354
Better.

08:44.389 --> 08:46.755
I still can't believe the girl I
played bride with in fifth grade

08:46.791 --> 08:48.124
is getting married.

08:48.159 --> 08:49.058
[phone vibrating]

08:49.094 --> 08:50.059
Do you remember our veils?

08:50.095 --> 08:50.793
[gasps]

08:50.828 --> 08:51.760
Yes!

08:51.796 --> 08:53.029
Excuse me, I gotta take this.

08:53.064 --> 08:54.130
Work calls.

08:54.165 --> 08:56.399
The one we uh, the one we made
out of dish towels?

08:56.434 --> 08:57.867
[laughs]

08:57.902 --> 08:59.402
Those were very chic.

08:59.437 --> 09:01.104
Maybe I should think about
bringing those back.

09:01.139 --> 09:03.139
Maybe it's a good thing you
became an interior designer

09:03.174 --> 09:04.307
and not a fashion designer.

09:04.342 --> 09:05.274
Hey.

09:05.310 --> 09:07.276
I bet I could make an entire
wedding dress

09:07.312 --> 09:08.411
out of terry cloth.

09:08.446 --> 09:09.412
Don't freak me out.

09:09.447 --> 09:11.714
Anything bridal freaks you out.

09:11.749 --> 09:12.581
That's not true.

09:12.617 --> 09:14.150
I've pictured my
wedding day before.

09:14.185 --> 09:16.452
Once. Like, a million
years ago.

09:16.488 --> 09:18.154
More like ten years ago.

09:18.189 --> 09:19.822
And it's not my fault
it fell apart.

09:19.857 --> 09:21.891
Ok, I know you don't like
me saying this

09:21.926 --> 09:23.893
but you need to get out there.

09:23.928 --> 09:26.396
You don't wanna be my sad,
single friend

09:26.431 --> 09:28.164
when I'm married
with, like, six kids.

09:28.199 --> 09:31.501
I have been out there before,
plenty.

09:31.536 --> 09:34.237
Ok, maybe not plenty but,
you know...

09:34.272 --> 09:37.140
You can't keep comparing
everyone to Nate.

09:37.175 --> 09:38.508
What?

09:38.543 --> 09:39.842
This has nothing to do
with Nate.

09:39.877 --> 09:41.677
I haven't seen or spoken
to him in years.

09:41.712 --> 09:43.112
You know that.

09:43.148 --> 09:45.314
<i>Even if I did I'd still be fine.</i>

09:45.350 --> 09:46.615
Then why aren't you dating?

09:46.651 --> 09:50.186
Because I've been busy with the
one relationship I can control.

09:50.221 --> 09:54.323
Oh please, do not tell me that
you are talking about the cafe.

09:54.359 --> 09:55.258
What?

09:55.293 --> 09:57.260
You do realize how pathetic
that sounds.

09:57.295 --> 10:01.630
Ok, pathetic may be a tad harsh.

10:01.666 --> 10:03.433
And yes, I do.

10:03.468 --> 10:06.135
That's why I'm gonna order us
some burgers.

10:06.171 --> 10:07.170
Good move.

10:07.505 --> 10:09.305
Good move.

10:11.476 --> 10:14.043
Well, I would be lying if I said
we weren't a little surprised

10:14.079 --> 10:16.946
to hear you wanted to bring
your program to Indian Lake,

10:16.981 --> 10:18.881
but we're very happy
to have you.

10:18.916 --> 10:20.616
I couldn't leave my hometown
off the rotation.

10:20.651 --> 10:22.485
Even if my family
doesn't live here anymore.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.020
Well, Dr. Langston speaks
very highly of you.

10:25.056 --> 10:27.957
He says you're one of his best
new cardiologists.

10:27.992 --> 10:29.158
Hopefully that means
he'll consider me

10:29.194 --> 10:31.360
for his new research program,
if the grant goes through.

10:31.396 --> 10:32.661
I'm sure he will.

10:32.697 --> 10:33.862
I don't know.

10:33.898 --> 10:36.065
There's a ton of interest.

10:36.101 --> 10:37.200
But it's all about standing out,
right?

10:37.235 --> 10:38.334
Just like college.

10:38.369 --> 10:40.236
You have to pack on the
extracurricular to get noticed.

10:40.271 --> 10:42.238
So you developed a crash course?

10:42.273 --> 10:43.639
A six-week course.

10:43.674 --> 10:46.809
In clinical communication
after cardiac surgery.

10:46.844 --> 10:48.511
Good bedside manner
is everything.

10:48.546 --> 10:50.846
Especially to the people
you're treating.

10:50.915 --> 10:53.382
But sometimes, when you're
pushing for advancement,

10:53.418 --> 10:54.450
that can get lost.

10:54.486 --> 10:57.186
Well, I can see why he speaks
so highly of you.

10:57.222 --> 10:58.020
[knocking]

10:58.055 --> 10:58.887
Oh, Nate, this is
Charlie Simpson,

10:58.923 --> 11:01.224
one of our best
physician's assistants.

11:01.259 --> 11:02.691
Aren't I the only one?

11:02.727 --> 11:04.160
Still the best.

11:04.195 --> 11:05.561
Charlie, this is Dr. Barzonni.

11:05.597 --> 11:07.230
Dr. Barzonni, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

11:07.265 --> 11:08.531
Likewise.

11:08.566 --> 11:09.798
Have a seat, Charlie.

11:09.834 --> 11:12.535
Charlie here is gonna give you
a quick tour of the hospital,

11:12.570 --> 11:14.003
set you up with
corporate housing,

11:14.038 --> 11:16.205
show you to your office,
the lecture hall...

11:16.241 --> 11:18.941
More importantly, our newly
renovated cafeteria.

11:18.976 --> 11:20.409
The kitchen is huge.

11:20.445 --> 11:22.245
That's great.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.580
I know that you grew up here
but we could also

11:24.616 --> 11:26.249
show you around town
if you'd like.

11:26.284 --> 11:28.217
It's, uh, been a long time.

11:28.253 --> 11:31.053
Probably too long,
so that would be great.

11:31.088 --> 11:32.288
Perfect.

11:32.323 --> 11:35.525
Again, Nate, very glad
you're here.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.293
Now, if you'll excuse me.

11:37.328 --> 11:39.795
(under his breath) I'm not so sure
everyone will be so happy.

11:39.830 --> 11:40.896
I'm sorry, what?

11:40.931 --> 11:43.966
Oh, nothing.

11:44.001 --> 11:45.535
Ready for your tour?

11:45.570 --> 11:46.536
Yeah.

12:12.029 --> 12:14.564
Maddie, we're ready for you.

12:14.599 --> 12:16.432
Yeah, ok.

12:19.870 --> 12:20.736
Hi.

12:20.771 --> 12:21.770
Hi.

12:33.318 --> 12:37.420
I'm not usually a cake person
but your maple buttermilk

12:37.455 --> 12:42.325
with french toast flakes may
have just changed my mind.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.260
And location as inspiration?

12:44.295 --> 12:46.995
Well, I just feel it's all part
of the overall feeling.

12:47.031 --> 12:51.166
And that comes out in the
quality of what you bake.

12:51.202 --> 12:54.203
Well, it definitely sets
you apart.

12:54.239 --> 12:57.707
And your vision for growth
is clear here, but,

12:57.742 --> 12:58.974
well I'm sure Alex has told you

12:59.009 --> 13:01.277
that my time is
extremely limited.

13:01.312 --> 13:03.279
At this stage in my career
I'm only taking on projects

13:03.314 --> 13:06.649
that I feel very
passionate about.

13:06.684 --> 13:09.552
I... I want to do things
that make people feel good

13:09.587 --> 13:12.221
out in the world
and add a bright spot

13:12.257 --> 13:13.689
to their communities.

13:13.725 --> 13:16.892
So I would need to see
that same passion from you.

13:16.927 --> 13:19.562
This is all I ever wanted
to do,

13:19.597 --> 13:21.964
and I've poured everything
I have into it.

13:21.999 --> 13:24.433
And I don't plan on stopping.

13:28.339 --> 13:30.573
I can see that.

13:30.608 --> 13:33.842
Which is why I'm willing to come
and take a look at your space.

13:33.878 --> 13:35.043
Really?

13:35.079 --> 13:37.112
This is pretty feel-good.

13:38.750 --> 13:43.419
How is Monday,
week after next, say 9:00 am?

13:43.454 --> 13:45.588
Perfect.

13:45.623 --> 13:47.089
So is this.

13:47.124 --> 13:49.024
[laughs]

13:49.059 --> 13:51.226
I can't believe the investor
behind Equator

13:51.262 --> 13:52.361
is coming to Indian Lake.

13:52.397 --> 13:53.862
She's- she's amazing.

13:53.898 --> 13:55.230
I could say the same thing
about you.

13:55.266 --> 13:56.532
She was clearly impressed.

13:56.567 --> 13:58.267
Well, I don't want to get
too excited.

13:58.303 --> 13:59.602
Well, she still has to look at
the space,

13:59.637 --> 14:01.771
consider franchise
possibilities.

14:01.806 --> 14:05.107
What if I just want to expand
what I already have?

14:05.142 --> 14:06.609
You know, keep it
super personal?

14:06.644 --> 14:08.711
Just focus on getting
a deal done, first.

14:08.746 --> 14:09.745
Work out specifics later.

14:09.781 --> 14:11.013
Ok.

14:11.048 --> 14:11.947
Anything else?

14:11.982 --> 14:13.449
You might wanna work on
some hard numbers

14:13.484 --> 14:14.717
for the expansion and remodel,

14:14.752 --> 14:16.885
and she's gonna wanna look at
your assets so your building,

14:16.921 --> 14:18.754
your recipes, your logo,
they're all great.

14:18.790 --> 14:21.590
A website would really help.

14:21.626 --> 14:24.026
Other than that I am pretty
much out of it.

14:24.061 --> 14:25.027
Oh, wow.

14:25.062 --> 14:26.128
So- so that's it?

14:26.163 --> 14:28.063
More or less, yeah.

14:28.098 --> 14:30.399
Actually, there is one
more question.

14:30.435 --> 14:31.900
You want more cupcakes,
don't you?

14:31.936 --> 14:33.436
Yes.

14:33.471 --> 14:36.238
Also, I was wondering
what you were doing Friday.

14:36.273 --> 14:39.041
There's an art opening
in the city.

14:41.111 --> 14:44.714
Wait, you said no to him?

14:44.749 --> 14:46.949
I get that you wanna focus
on work right now

14:46.984 --> 14:49.618
but I can't believe
that you said no.

14:49.654 --> 14:50.553
This is next level.

14:50.588 --> 14:51.620
I can't even get a date.

14:51.656 --> 14:54.490
I just didn't want to mix
business with pleasure.

14:54.525 --> 14:57.092
I thought you said he was
pretty much out of it.

14:57.127 --> 14:58.494
He is.

14:58.529 --> 15:00.128
But look, it's just
a little art opening,

15:00.164 --> 15:01.964
I'm sure he just needed a date.

15:01.999 --> 15:03.566
Oh, yeah. You're right.

15:03.601 --> 15:04.500
He looks like the kind of guy

15:04.535 --> 15:06.101
who'd have a very hard time
finding one.

15:06.136 --> 15:07.102
That's probably it.

15:07.137 --> 15:07.903
Ok, wait a minute.

15:07.938 --> 15:09.638
Why are we talking more
about Alex

15:09.674 --> 15:11.674
rather than the fact that
we are this close

15:11.709 --> 15:12.908
to landing an investor?

15:12.943 --> 15:14.510
You're right, it
is very exciting.

15:14.545 --> 15:15.611
Very.

15:15.646 --> 15:16.846
Thank you.

15:16.881 --> 15:19.014
Can we go back to talking about
your ideas for the remodel?

15:19.049 --> 15:20.315
Fine.

15:20.351 --> 15:21.350
I'll get us some coffee.

15:21.386 --> 15:22.485
Thank you.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.988
But you are going to run out of
excuses sooner or later

15:26.023 --> 15:27.523
and uh-oh, what was that?

15:27.558 --> 15:28.156
Oh, right.

15:28.192 --> 15:29.458
You're gonna have to date.

15:29.494 --> 15:32.995
She's right.

15:33.030 --> 15:35.130
You're impossible.

15:36.467 --> 15:38.667
Hey, how are you?

15:41.038 --> 15:43.606
Ok, so what happens if this
grant goes through?

15:43.641 --> 15:46.141
For me?

15:46.176 --> 15:48.310
Well, fingers crossed Langston
finds a spot for me

15:48.345 --> 15:49.512
on his research team.

15:49.547 --> 15:51.346
Hey, full-time researcher.

15:51.382 --> 15:53.516
Yeah, that's kinda the dream.

15:53.551 --> 15:54.349
But for now-

15:54.385 --> 15:57.019
You're stuck with me.

15:57.054 --> 15:58.253
Yeah.

15:58.289 --> 16:00.790
Although I don't think there's
much else new to show you, man.

16:00.825 --> 16:04.159
At least, not in the nine months
I've been back.

16:09.066 --> 16:12.735
Oh yeah, I haven't tried these
yet but I hear they're tasty.

16:12.770 --> 16:15.170
She really did it.

16:15.205 --> 16:16.806
So you two are gonna
go see venues?

16:16.841 --> 16:17.907
I'm going to look at venues.

16:17.942 --> 16:20.409
Luke is going to drop me off
on his way back to work.

16:20.445 --> 16:21.209
Right, Luke?

16:21.245 --> 16:23.178
Trust me, I'd rather go
with you.

16:23.213 --> 16:24.012
Mmmhmm.

16:26.016 --> 16:28.584
This new project sounds
pretty intense.

16:28.619 --> 16:29.718
Construction is stressful.

16:29.754 --> 16:30.886
You always say that.

16:30.922 --> 16:32.020
Right.

16:32.056 --> 16:35.057
I just wish he'd slow down
long enough to set a date.

16:35.092 --> 16:36.525
You will.

16:38.696 --> 16:42.030
Unless... he's got cold feet.

16:42.066 --> 16:42.932
Oh, please.

16:42.967 --> 16:44.767
He adores you.

16:44.802 --> 16:46.368
You know that.

16:46.403 --> 16:48.236
Besides, he doesn't look like
he has cold feet.

16:48.272 --> 16:50.005
Trust me, I know.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.040
Then why does he seem
perfectly content

16:52.076 --> 16:53.742
staying in the engaged phase?

16:53.778 --> 16:56.178
Because it's a really nice phase
to be in.

16:56.213 --> 16:57.780
Maybe you should just enjoy it.

16:57.815 --> 17:00.048
You sound like my mom.

17:00.084 --> 17:01.049
Well...

17:01.085 --> 17:02.017
You're right.

17:02.052 --> 17:04.553
I'm just, you know...

17:04.589 --> 17:05.252
You ready?

17:05.289 --> 17:07.522
Yes. I am.

17:07.558 --> 17:08.891
I hope you know your hazelnut
cappuccino cupcakes

17:08.925 --> 17:10.425
are what's keeping me going.

17:10.461 --> 17:12.294
My new client is a bit
of a nightmare.

17:12.329 --> 17:15.297
Always here to help.

17:15.332 --> 17:16.598
See? I told you.

17:16.634 --> 17:17.766
Work stress.

17:17.801 --> 17:18.634
I'll send pictures.

17:18.669 --> 17:19.902
You better.

17:22.507 --> 17:23.137
Hey, Chloe?

17:23.173 --> 17:24.205
Mmmhmm?

17:24.241 --> 17:25.741
I think we need to get some
more honey lavender.

17:25.776 --> 17:28.410
Um, oh, and we only have
two hazelnuts left.

17:28.444 --> 17:29.311
Ok.

17:29.346 --> 17:31.113
[rings bell]

17:31.148 --> 17:32.014
And you'd be...

17:40.958 --> 17:43.759
What're you doing here, Nate?

17:50.621 --> 17:52.621
So, you, uh, you're back
at our little town.

17:52.671 --> 17:53.703
For work?

17:53.739 --> 17:55.372
Just for six weeks.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.641
I'm touring different hospitals
with a lecture series.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.809
You guys do know each other.

17:59.844 --> 18:02.512
We dated for seven years.

18:02.547 --> 18:04.748
But four of those
were long-distance.

18:04.783 --> 18:05.882
That's still a long time.

18:05.917 --> 18:09.319
A very long time ago.

18:09.354 --> 18:10.353
Can we help you with anything?

18:10.389 --> 18:12.054
Coffee? Cupcake?

18:12.090 --> 18:12.989
Chloe?

18:13.024 --> 18:13.923
Yeah.

18:13.958 --> 18:15.692
Um... right.

18:15.727 --> 18:19.396
Yes, that would mean
me helping you.

18:19.431 --> 18:24.601
Um, so we have a sugar cookie
cupcake with brown butter...

18:24.636 --> 18:27.604
Well, I can't say no to that.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.606
Great.

18:29.641 --> 18:30.840
I'm Charlie, by the way.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.041
I don't think we've ever met.

18:32.076 --> 18:33.710
I guess not.

18:35.747 --> 18:38.381
I'll get those cupcakes.

18:39.551 --> 18:40.717
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you,
this is uh,

18:40.752 --> 18:41.851
this is a little weird.

18:41.886 --> 18:43.119
You just popping in like this.

18:43.154 --> 18:45.922
Well, I would have called but
you told me not to, remember?

18:45.957 --> 18:47.691
Could have sent a pigeon.

18:47.726 --> 18:51.227
Look, I'm not proud of
how we ended things.

18:51.262 --> 18:52.562
How I handled it.

18:52.597 --> 18:53.563
We were young.

18:53.598 --> 18:57.266
I just... things were
just changing so fast,

18:57.302 --> 18:58.635
I got overwhelmed.

18:58.670 --> 19:00.370
You got cold feet.

19:00.405 --> 19:02.305
Ok. Ok.

19:02.341 --> 19:03.740
But you were the one
who ended it.

19:03.775 --> 19:04.441
Officially.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.075
I just said what you wouldn't.

19:06.110 --> 19:08.945
I'm sorry, I have to get back
to work.

19:09.981 --> 19:11.648
I just wanna hear how you are.

19:11.683 --> 19:12.582
How things have been.

19:12.617 --> 19:14.451
For ten years?

19:16.855 --> 19:19.222
I can't believe this
is your place.

19:19.257 --> 19:21.825
I mean, I can because you always
knew it would be someday,

19:21.860 --> 19:25.595
it's just...
it's pretty amazing.

19:25.630 --> 19:27.630
Your grandma would be
really proud.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.634
Well, thank you.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.503
At least you got to see it.

19:33.538 --> 19:35.805
I guess that's something.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.241
What do you mean?

19:38.276 --> 19:39.743
Well, we have an interested
investor

19:39.778 --> 19:40.943
but if that doesn't pan out

19:40.979 --> 19:43.646
we might not be open
for long.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.248
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

19:45.283 --> 19:48.150
Of course not.

19:48.186 --> 19:50.953
I gotta get back to work.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.293
Are we going?

19:57.328 --> 19:59.362
Not yet.

20:03.334 --> 20:06.168
Oh, am I helping you now?

20:06.204 --> 20:09.639
I'd like to order four dozen
cupcakes, please.

20:09.674 --> 20:11.875
For right now?

20:11.910 --> 20:15.645
If I'm not too late.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.614
Ok.

21:08.633 --> 21:10.500
[message alert]

21:40.098 --> 21:41.464
Hi, Alex.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.066
It's uh, it's Maddie.

21:44.102 --> 21:45.568
Hey.

21:45.604 --> 21:47.804
Um, I was wondering, do you-

21:47.839 --> 21:49.772
do you still need a date
for Friday night?

21:51.342 --> 21:52.742
You don't think it's too much?

21:52.777 --> 21:54.611
It's an art opening.
In the city.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.713
Give us a twirl.

21:57.782 --> 21:58.581
You look perfect.

21:58.617 --> 22:00.216
Thank you.

22:00.251 --> 22:02.418
And it's just a friendly
night out, anyway.

22:02.453 --> 22:03.953
Plus, he lives in Chicago.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.655
Let's not doom it before
you even get there.

22:05.690 --> 22:06.723
[laughs]

22:06.758 --> 22:08.224
No, I won't. I'm excited.

22:08.259 --> 22:08.925
And you must be, too,

22:08.960 --> 22:10.393
for the community fundraiser.

22:10.428 --> 22:12.261
I'm excited for the cause.

22:12.296 --> 22:13.596
Not sure about all the work.

22:13.632 --> 22:15.131
Well, I upped your order
to include

22:15.166 --> 22:16.566
more of the sugar cookie cakes.

22:16.601 --> 22:18.234
I hope that's ok.

22:19.804 --> 22:22.805
Are you sure you still
wanna donate?

22:22.841 --> 22:24.240
I know it's not the best time,
money-wise.

22:24.275 --> 22:26.442
Oh, please.

22:26.477 --> 22:28.745
You've had to taste every
new cupcake flavor I've had

22:28.780 --> 22:30.947
since I was, what, 13?

22:30.982 --> 22:32.815
It's the least I can do.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.652
Besides, there's too much
history in that community hall

22:35.687 --> 22:37.654
for it to be torn down.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.823
Let's hope everyone feels
the same.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.759
Speaking of history,

22:42.794 --> 22:46.095
I heard that Nate Barzonni's
back in town.

22:46.130 --> 22:49.498
It's ok to feel uneasy about it.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.167
I'm fine.

22:51.202 --> 22:52.268
I know.

22:52.303 --> 22:54.170
But that doesn't change the fact

22:54.205 --> 22:57.306
that no one ever forgets
their first love.

22:57.341 --> 22:59.375
Just remember: it doesn't mean
you're not over them,

22:59.410 --> 23:01.177
despite what people say.

23:01.212 --> 23:03.947
It just means they'll always be
a part of you.

23:03.982 --> 23:05.347
Hmm.

23:05.383 --> 23:08.517
Now, let's get you to the city
to have some fun.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.027
I'm not entirely sure
I know what that is

23:18.063 --> 23:20.697
but it's impressive.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.832
I think I see a face.

23:22.867 --> 23:26.569
I don't think that's a face.

23:26.605 --> 23:29.072
Well, whatever it is, it's
definitely something functional.

23:29.107 --> 23:31.074
[laughs]

23:31.109 --> 23:32.341
See? This is why you need
to come

23:32.376 --> 23:33.910
into the city more.

23:33.945 --> 23:35.211
Why? So I can help you
figure out

23:35.246 --> 23:36.212
what paintings mean?

23:36.247 --> 23:39.482
Yes, and so we can go to
more of these together.

23:41.385 --> 23:42.719
Thank you.

23:45.890 --> 23:49.993
So, you really never wanted
to move to the city?

23:50.028 --> 23:54.697
Un-huh. I like to visit
but I really love the quiet.

23:54.733 --> 23:56.833
The community I have.

23:56.868 --> 23:58.400
I find that really sweet.

23:58.436 --> 24:00.569
And you've always known
what you wanted?

24:00.605 --> 24:03.072
Took me most of my 20's
to figure that out.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.741
Think of all the time you saved.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.442
Yeah, maybe.

24:06.477 --> 24:10.046
But some things worked out
better than others.

24:10.081 --> 24:12.682
So you- you never had
a vision of this?

24:12.717 --> 24:14.250
This is what I wanna be?

24:14.285 --> 24:15.217
You mean when I grow up?

24:15.253 --> 24:15.918
Yeah.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.687
No. Actually, that's not true.

24:17.722 --> 24:21.257
I wanted to be a cashier
at a grocery store.

24:21.292 --> 24:22.258
Really?

24:22.293 --> 24:23.492
Yeah.

24:23.528 --> 24:24.794
I thought you got to take home
the money every single night

24:24.829 --> 24:26.529
from the drawer.

24:26.564 --> 24:28.965
That's- that's very
entrepreneurial of you.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.535
I gotta keep up with this
lifestyle somehow.

24:32.570 --> 24:34.403
Stay there.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.483
I definitely know what that is.

24:47.518 --> 24:50.720
Just a little something
to say thank you.

24:50.755 --> 24:52.421
For what?

24:52.456 --> 24:54.657
For changing your mind.

24:54.693 --> 24:58.260
I'm really glad this worked out.

24:58.296 --> 25:00.229
Me too.

25:07.005 --> 25:07.804
Good morning.

25:07.839 --> 25:08.771
Hi.

25:08.807 --> 25:11.941
Yeah, I hear that and I choose
to ignore it

25:11.976 --> 25:13.910
as long as the coffee
still tastes good.

25:13.945 --> 25:14.944
So far.

25:14.979 --> 25:15.812
Great.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.480
Looks like someone had
a good night.

25:18.516 --> 25:19.749
The art was odd.

25:19.784 --> 25:21.150
But kind of amazing.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.819
And your date?

25:22.854 --> 25:24.486
He's very nice.

25:24.522 --> 25:25.521
And?

25:25.556 --> 25:28.357
And I'm just taking it slow.

25:28.392 --> 25:29.291
So you're gonna see him again?

25:29.327 --> 25:31.794
Well, we- we really didn't
set up a date

25:31.830 --> 25:34.496
but uh, but yeah, I think so.

25:34.532 --> 25:35.965
Huh.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.899
Good.

25:36.935 --> 25:39.936
Well, I guess it is safe
to give you this.

25:39.971 --> 25:41.270
And what's this?

25:41.305 --> 25:43.873
Dr. Barzonni, I'm assuming
that's Nate.

25:43.908 --> 25:46.175
He ordered six dozen cupcakes.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.110
Ok.

25:47.145 --> 25:48.044
But he wants them delivered.

25:48.079 --> 25:49.612
Apparently there's
some kind of reception

25:49.647 --> 25:51.513
after his first lecture.

25:51.549 --> 25:53.649
That's fine.

25:53.684 --> 25:56.352
He wants you to bring them.

25:56.387 --> 25:57.220
Why do I have to?

25:57.255 --> 25:58.187
Can't you?

25:58.223 --> 26:00.156
Apparently not.

26:00.191 --> 26:03.259
But he promised it would be good
for business.

26:10.566 --> 26:12.058
<i>In our quest to find</i>

26:12.108 --> 26:15.176
the most minimally invasive
cardiac surgeries

26:15.211 --> 26:18.512
we've unfortunately buried
our heads in the sand.

26:18.547 --> 26:21.048
That's why when we step out from
behind the computer screens

26:21.083 --> 26:24.118
we need to remember to operate
from the heart.

26:24.153 --> 26:25.385
Be human.

26:25.421 --> 26:26.553
Personal.

26:26.588 --> 26:28.022
Compassionate.

26:28.057 --> 26:30.590
Technology can't provide that
for us,

26:30.626 --> 26:32.793
so that's our job.

26:32.829 --> 26:34.528
That's where we start.

26:34.563 --> 26:38.098
[applause]

26:38.134 --> 26:39.867
Now, since this is
our first lecture

26:39.902 --> 26:41.235
and you have willingly signed up

26:41.270 --> 26:43.938
to listen to me drone on
for another five,

26:43.973 --> 26:46.307
I want to reward you all
with some local treats

26:46.342 --> 26:48.275
from Cupcakes and Coffee Cafe.

26:48.311 --> 26:52.313
Maddie Strong, the very talented
owner and baker,

26:52.348 --> 26:54.815
has been kind enough to bring
them in herself.

26:54.851 --> 26:56.283
Enjoy.

26:59.688 --> 27:00.487
Hi.

27:00.522 --> 27:01.222
Hi.

27:01.257 --> 27:01.922
Here you go.

27:01.958 --> 27:03.724
Thanks.

27:07.997 --> 27:08.996
Hey. How are you?

27:09.031 --> 27:10.064
Here you go.

27:14.436 --> 27:16.003
Thanks for coming.

27:16.038 --> 27:17.905
You didn't leave me much choice.

27:17.940 --> 27:21.275
I think you know I would have
placed the order either way.

27:21.310 --> 27:23.143
Well, even though I just had
to grab napkins,

27:23.179 --> 27:24.912
the kitchen here is fantastic.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.146
The food is incredible.

27:26.182 --> 27:29.250
My wife has been telling me
about your cupcakes for ages.

27:29.285 --> 27:30.484
They're as good as she said.

27:30.519 --> 27:31.418
Thank you.

27:31.453 --> 27:33.620
Always a good idea to listen
to the wife.

27:36.859 --> 27:37.291
<i>Maddie.</i>

27:37.326 --> 27:37.958
Yes.

27:37.994 --> 27:38.525
Hi.

27:38.560 --> 27:39.994
Ok, these are amazing.

27:40.029 --> 27:41.996
I was just wondering,
do you do parties?

27:42.031 --> 27:43.230
Of course.

27:43.266 --> 27:45.165
It's my daughter's sweet 16
and I think she'd be quite happy

27:45.201 --> 27:47.334
with just a room-full
of desserts.

27:47.370 --> 27:49.370
Should I order online or...

27:49.405 --> 27:50.604
Well, I'm a bit old-fashioned,

27:50.639 --> 27:54.141
so for now you can just call me,
we can go over the options.

27:54.176 --> 27:55.475
Great.

27:58.047 --> 27:58.979
What?

27:59.015 --> 28:00.014
You're gonna make me the hit
of the hospital.

28:00.049 --> 28:02.283
Well, I don't know about that
but at this rate

28:02.318 --> 28:04.184
I'm running out of cards.

28:04.220 --> 28:05.652
You don't have a website?

28:05.687 --> 28:06.620
Don't remind me.

28:06.655 --> 28:08.122
I know it's a good thing
for investors to see

28:08.157 --> 28:10.624
but do you remember
how hard it was for me

28:10.659 --> 28:12.192
to give up my flip phone?

28:12.228 --> 28:15.029
Ah, technology's not really
your strong suit.

28:15.064 --> 28:17.164
And I know you don't
like change.

28:17.199 --> 28:18.432
Well, no, it's not that,

28:18.467 --> 28:20.901
it's just that I haven't really
had time to think about it.

28:20.937 --> 28:23.337
And now I have all this budget
stuff that I have to firm up

28:23.372 --> 28:25.739
and honestly I don't know
where to start.

28:25.774 --> 28:28.142
I can't really justify hiring
someone right now, so-

28:28.177 --> 28:30.210
Why don't you hire me?

28:30.246 --> 28:31.278
<i>For free?</i>

28:32.915 --> 28:33.981
I'm serious.

28:34.016 --> 28:34.982
You're a doctor.

28:35.017 --> 28:38.018
Who took a lot of tech classes
in undergrad.

28:39.521 --> 28:42.990
I know what you're trying
to do and I appreciate that.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.024
Oh yeah?

28:44.060 --> 28:44.724
What's that-

28:44.760 --> 28:46.026
Hey, Maddie. These are great.

28:46.062 --> 28:46.860
Thank you.

28:46.895 --> 28:47.727
See ya.

28:47.763 --> 28:48.795
See ya.

28:49.731 --> 28:52.066
You're trying to make up
for what happened.

28:52.101 --> 28:54.734
Maybe even be friends.

28:57.739 --> 28:59.273
I'm sorry, Nate.

28:59.308 --> 29:02.209
I just can't do that.

29:02.244 --> 29:03.910
Well, at least let me help
with this then.

29:03.946 --> 29:04.845
It's something I can do.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.380
Want to do.

29:06.415 --> 29:09.583
And we can keep conversations
strictly business.

29:09.618 --> 29:12.286
Well, I'm sure you're
pretty busy with work.

29:12.321 --> 29:13.354
Actually, I'm not.

29:13.389 --> 29:14.254
Really? You?

29:14.290 --> 29:15.489
You're always busy.

29:15.524 --> 29:18.359
Aside from my weekly lectures
my schedule is more free now

29:18.394 --> 29:20.260
than it has been in years.

29:20.296 --> 29:21.528
So how about tomorrow night?

29:21.563 --> 29:23.530
Say, 6:00?

29:23.565 --> 29:24.999
<i>I'll pick you up.</i>

30:29.331 --> 30:30.330
[knocking]

30:40.142 --> 30:41.575
Coming!

30:43.379 --> 30:44.211
Hey.

30:44.246 --> 30:45.045
You ready?

30:45.081 --> 30:46.680
Yeah.

30:48.717 --> 30:50.617
I can't believe they still
have the Bambino.

30:50.652 --> 30:53.187
I can't believe you still like
french fries on your pizza.

30:53.222 --> 30:54.288
Well, I don't know.

30:54.323 --> 30:55.722
Maybe my tastes have matured.

30:55.757 --> 30:57.324
Thank you.

31:00.429 --> 31:02.529
Mmm.

31:02.565 --> 31:03.830
Nope.

31:03.865 --> 31:05.165
It's still amazing.

31:05.201 --> 31:06.900
And you're a cardiologist.

31:06.935 --> 31:08.668
Who's currently off duty.

31:08.704 --> 31:11.205
Ok, so um, what else
do we need?

31:11.240 --> 31:13.240
Mmm, ok.

31:13.275 --> 31:15.309
So how many flavors
do you have?

31:15.344 --> 31:17.211
You clearly took off
my favorite,

31:17.246 --> 31:18.878
the chocolate velvet.

31:20.449 --> 31:21.982
Right.

31:22.017 --> 31:24.551
Strictly business.

31:24.587 --> 31:26.086
Fourteen, signatures.

31:26.122 --> 31:28.088
But uh, we can do made-to-order.

31:28.124 --> 31:31.858
Oh, so if I wanted a rose petal
cupcake you could do it?

31:31.893 --> 31:32.659
No.

31:32.694 --> 31:33.627
No?

31:33.662 --> 31:35.395
I mean, I could, but
that sounds terrible.

31:35.431 --> 31:36.230
What?

31:36.265 --> 31:37.364
No, come on.

31:37.399 --> 31:38.499
You put the rose petals
on top,

31:38.534 --> 31:41.435
make it into a little
ornate flower.

31:41.470 --> 31:44.371
Ok, you did always have
a knack for the details.

31:44.406 --> 31:45.939
Yeah, my vision,
your precision.

31:45.974 --> 31:46.840
Remember?

31:46.875 --> 31:48.175
That was your catch phrase,
not mine.

31:48.210 --> 31:49.343
You still remember it.

31:49.378 --> 31:50.177
Catchy.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.546
And you're still a nut,
you know that?

31:52.581 --> 31:55.949
You may be a fancy doctor
but you're still a nut.

31:55.984 --> 31:58.218
Anything to make you laugh.

31:58.254 --> 32:01.054
[phone rings]

32:01.089 --> 32:04.124
Oh, um... sorry, I- I really
need to get this.

32:04.160 --> 32:04.891
Of course.

32:04.926 --> 32:06.326
Excuse me.

32:08.297 --> 32:09.296
Hello?

32:09.331 --> 32:11.097
<i>Hi.</i>

32:11.133 --> 32:14.801
Yeah, that was-
that was definitely fun.

32:14.836 --> 32:17.571
And bizarre, yeah.

32:17.606 --> 32:22.409
Oh, just working on the proposal
and- and the website.

32:22.444 --> 32:23.810
Ok.

32:23.845 --> 32:25.145
Um, yeah.

32:25.181 --> 32:26.580
Ok, bye.

32:28.684 --> 32:30.484
Sorry about that,
it was just a quick...

32:30.519 --> 32:32.486
No, no worries at all.

32:32.521 --> 32:37.791
Um... ok, so uh,
where were we?

32:37.826 --> 32:39.226
Right.

32:39.261 --> 32:41.928
The website.

32:46.001 --> 32:46.966
Thank you.

32:47.002 --> 32:48.602
You're welcome.

32:50.372 --> 32:52.739
So I was thinking,
if it's ok with you,

32:52.774 --> 32:56.176
I'll come by the cafe
and I'll take some pictures.

32:56.212 --> 32:58.745
They teach you photography
in undergrad, as well?

32:58.780 --> 32:59.313
No.

32:59.348 --> 33:00.914
No, my iPhone did that.

33:00.949 --> 33:02.416
Right.

33:02.451 --> 33:04.318
So work on the descriptions
we talked about.

33:04.353 --> 33:06.353
I'll come by, I'll take
some pictures,

33:06.388 --> 33:08.021
and then we'll start building
your website.

33:08.056 --> 33:09.122
Ok.

33:09.157 --> 33:10.591
You really think we can have
this done by my meeting?

33:10.626 --> 33:11.791
I know it's quick, but...

33:11.827 --> 33:13.493
I'm going to try my hardest.

33:13.529 --> 33:14.361
Ok.

33:14.396 --> 33:15.795
Thank you.

33:15.831 --> 33:17.497
I'm excited.

33:17.533 --> 33:19.299
You've come a long way
since the flip phone.

33:19.335 --> 33:22.369
I have.

33:22.404 --> 33:25.171
You know, things have been
really stressful

33:25.207 --> 33:29.676
with all of this so thank you
for making it fun.

33:29.712 --> 33:32.613
You were always really good
at doing that.

33:32.648 --> 33:36.850
Hopefully I still am.

33:36.885 --> 33:39.986
It really is nice to see you,
Maddie.

33:40.021 --> 33:41.288
It's nice to see you, too.

33:41.323 --> 33:42.356
Really?

33:42.391 --> 33:43.823
Well, maybe we should keep
this party going then.

33:43.859 --> 33:45.792
Go for a hike,
just like old times?

33:45.827 --> 33:46.960
Don't push it, Barzonni.

33:46.995 --> 33:48.362
Ok, I'm going.

33:48.397 --> 33:50.130
I'm leaving very business-like.

33:50.165 --> 33:51.231
[laughs]

33:51.267 --> 33:52.633
[message alert]

33:56.104 --> 33:58.672
I should let you go.

33:58.707 --> 34:00.540
Well, thanks again.

34:00.576 --> 34:02.242
I really think
it's gonna be great.

34:02.278 --> 34:03.877
Me too.

34:41.937 --> 34:43.771
Oooh!

34:43.806 --> 34:45.438
Ha-ha.

34:45.474 --> 34:50.678
Ok, so this was definitely
not here when I was growing up.

34:50.713 --> 34:53.246
It's the first place I came to
when I moved back.

34:53.282 --> 34:55.114
It's the easiest thing
to do alone.

34:55.150 --> 34:57.584
Especially when I realized
most people I knew moved away.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.085
So how's it feel being back?

34:59.121 --> 35:01.021
It feels ok, mostly.

35:01.056 --> 35:03.357
It's just a little complicated.

35:03.392 --> 35:04.825
Is that because of Maddie?

35:06.762 --> 35:07.761
Sorry.

35:08.798 --> 35:10.431
It's ok.

35:10.466 --> 35:12.433
I'm the one that messed up.

35:12.468 --> 35:17.204
We had our whole lives mapped
out but I guess work took over.

35:17.239 --> 35:20.741
It still feels like there's
something there, man.

35:20.776 --> 35:22.609
Unfortunately I don't think
you get another shot

35:22.645 --> 35:26.380
at something that great.

35:26.415 --> 35:28.081
I'm gonna get us some water.

35:28.116 --> 35:29.115
Sure.

35:34.490 --> 35:36.790
For the interior
that's as low as I can go.

35:36.826 --> 35:38.559
And I'll have Luke
send you his quote.

35:38.594 --> 35:41.094
But knocking walls down
is fairly simple.

35:41.129 --> 35:41.928
Great.

35:41.964 --> 35:43.196
Thank you.

35:43.232 --> 35:45.766
I just need to make sure I keep
everything as tight as possible.

35:45.801 --> 35:47.401
So do you feel better now?

35:47.436 --> 35:48.301
Much.

35:48.337 --> 35:49.135
You?

35:49.171 --> 35:49.970
About what?

35:50.005 --> 35:50.771
Luke?

35:50.806 --> 35:52.406
Uh, well, he said
he's gonna talk

35:52.441 --> 35:54.441
to the country club
this week

35:54.477 --> 35:56.410
so you may be
one step closer

35:56.445 --> 35:58.144
to that poofy lavender dress.

35:58.180 --> 35:59.179
Oh.

35:59.214 --> 36:01.147
Well, it's too bad I don't
have it for tonight.

36:01.183 --> 36:02.583
I still don't know
what I'm gonna wear.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.618
Big work party?

36:04.653 --> 36:05.986
I hate to say it...

36:06.021 --> 36:07.688
But it sounds kind of official.

36:07.723 --> 36:09.656
It's not official.

36:09.692 --> 36:10.691
Alex is just...

36:10.726 --> 36:12.259
Hard up for a date.

36:12.294 --> 36:13.159
Again?

36:13.195 --> 36:14.395
Yeah, exactly.

36:14.430 --> 36:17.197
Plus, I have to leave early
so it's gonna be a short night.

36:17.232 --> 36:17.898
What?

36:17.933 --> 36:19.633
Why... why would you do that?

36:19.668 --> 36:20.768
Leave early?

36:20.803 --> 36:23.670
Oh, because I still have
to bake six dozen cupcakes.

36:23.706 --> 36:24.638
For tomorrow.

36:24.673 --> 36:26.473
For Emma's fundraising?

36:26.509 --> 36:27.340
You remember.

36:27.376 --> 36:28.942
And now I have to finish
the proposal now

36:28.977 --> 36:29.943
that I have all these numbers.

36:29.978 --> 36:31.244
Good.

36:31.280 --> 36:34.314
For a second I thought it might
have something to do with Nate.

36:34.349 --> 36:35.482
What?

36:35.518 --> 36:36.717
Why?

36:36.752 --> 36:38.786
Why would- why would I say I
have anything to do with Nate?

36:38.821 --> 36:39.853
I don't know.

36:39.889 --> 36:41.789
You've been spending a lot
of time with him lately.

36:41.824 --> 36:43.724
Yes, on the website.

36:43.759 --> 36:44.892
That's it.

36:44.927 --> 36:46.960
Plus, it's almost over, so...

36:47.897 --> 36:48.829
ok, stop.

36:48.864 --> 36:50.731
You know, just gather
all your swatches.

36:50.766 --> 36:53.199
I'm starving.
Let's go to lunch.

36:54.670 --> 36:56.403
So it's New Year's Eve,
the ball's about to drop,

36:56.439 --> 36:58.138
he's still trying to close
one last deal.

36:58.173 --> 36:58.906
[laughs]

36:58.941 --> 36:59.873
You're a hard worker.

36:59.909 --> 37:01.408
Mmm... I just think
he likes his year-end

37:01.444 --> 37:02.108
above everyone else.

37:02.144 --> 37:03.209
I got the deal signed, didn't I?

37:03.245 --> 37:05.278
[laughs]

37:07.516 --> 37:08.849
Excuse me.

37:11.687 --> 37:12.719
You ok?

37:12.755 --> 37:13.687
You seem a little quiet.

37:13.722 --> 37:14.922
Me? Oh, sorry.

37:14.957 --> 37:17.424
You guys were just talking about
deals and all that's running

37:17.460 --> 37:20.561
through my mind is am I even
ready for Monday?

37:20.596 --> 37:23.229
Are my descriptions good
enough for the website?

37:23.265 --> 37:24.598
And then there's the whole
franchise thing.

37:24.633 --> 37:26.066
I still don't know what to do.

37:26.101 --> 37:27.300
You're gonna be great.

37:27.336 --> 37:29.937
All you have to remember is it's
all about selling yourself.

37:29.972 --> 37:32.606
You talk a big game and there's
no way they can say no.

37:32.641 --> 37:34.541
What if I'm not good at that?

37:34.577 --> 37:36.109
It's all part of the game.

37:36.144 --> 37:38.679
What's that saying?
Fake it until you make it.

37:38.714 --> 37:44.585
Well, again, not really my style
but um, I'll try.

37:50.158 --> 37:51.191
What're you doing?

37:51.226 --> 37:52.626
It's a little something
I like to call dancing.

37:52.661 --> 37:54.595
If you're game?

38:13.582 --> 38:18.519
[children laughing]

38:25.127 --> 38:27.427
Our goal is to restore
what's been damaged

38:27.462 --> 38:30.998
and breathe new life into this
beautiful old community hall.

38:31.033 --> 38:35.002
So dig deep and make
Indian Lake proud.

38:35.037 --> 38:36.436
Thank you all for coming.

38:36.471 --> 38:39.339
[applause]

38:39.374 --> 38:41.642
Ok, I think that's
the last sketch.

38:41.677 --> 38:42.442
Do you need anything else?

38:42.477 --> 38:43.744
No, I think I'm good.

38:43.779 --> 38:45.412
Ok, then I should get
back to work.

38:45.447 --> 38:48.114
Oh, actually, did you call Tim
at the country club?

38:48.150 --> 38:49.016
Oh right, that.

38:49.051 --> 38:51.084
No, but I will- I will call
right now.

38:51.119 --> 38:52.953
Luke, they only have
a few free dates

38:52.988 --> 38:56.189
left for weddings this year,
and he's your connection.

38:56.224 --> 38:57.591
I'm sorry. I will call.

38:57.626 --> 38:59.492
I promise.

38:59.528 --> 39:00.827
It just slipped my mind.

39:00.863 --> 39:03.296
Every time I try
to make plans...

39:03.331 --> 39:04.464
You know, forget it.

39:04.499 --> 39:08.435
This isn't the place and
you need to go to work, so...

39:08.470 --> 39:09.269
I love you.

39:09.304 --> 39:10.103
I'll call right now.

39:10.138 --> 39:11.137
Ok.

39:12.074 --> 39:13.874
Ok, so does anybody
wanna see the plans

39:13.909 --> 39:16.109
for the community hall?

39:16.144 --> 39:18.178
I would.

39:18.213 --> 39:20.013
Nate Barzonni.

39:20.049 --> 39:22.348
I was wondering when I was
gonna run into you.

39:22.384 --> 39:23.349
It's good to see you, Sarah.

39:23.385 --> 39:24.585
Is it?

39:24.620 --> 39:27.487
Cause if I were you I'd be
the last person I'd wanna see.

39:28.390 --> 39:30.691
That's fair.

39:36.331 --> 39:39.365
Do you really wanna
see those plans?

39:39.401 --> 39:41.969
Yeah, I do.

39:46.041 --> 39:49.309
So, how was your night?

39:49.344 --> 39:51.177
It was nice.

39:51.213 --> 39:53.680
A bit exhausting, but nice.

39:53.716 --> 39:54.815
I don't know how he does it.

39:54.850 --> 39:58.719
Everything is always so...
fancy.

39:58.754 --> 40:00.553
Well, he's a money guy.

40:00.589 --> 40:02.089
Yeah, well, I'm more of a pizza

40:02.124 --> 40:04.057
and a movie on the couch
kinda girl.

40:04.093 --> 40:05.225
In sweats.

40:05.260 --> 40:07.293
Well, maybe you can be both.

40:09.364 --> 40:11.431
Oh no.

40:11.466 --> 40:13.033
What? What's wrong?

40:13.068 --> 40:14.601
What?

40:14.637 --> 40:15.502
What's going on?

40:15.537 --> 40:16.402
Why are you hiding?

40:16.438 --> 40:17.938
I'm not- I'm not hiding.

40:17.973 --> 40:20.707
I... I am just a total clichÃ©.

40:20.743 --> 40:21.642
What?

40:21.677 --> 40:23.710
What're you talking about?
Do you know him?

40:23.746 --> 40:24.845
Know him?

40:24.880 --> 40:26.713
No, but did I have a huge
embarrassing crush on him

40:26.749 --> 40:27.547
in high school?

40:27.582 --> 40:28.815
Yes.

40:28.851 --> 40:29.650
I was the awkward nerd, he was
captain of the football team.

40:29.685 --> 40:32.385
See what I'm saying?
Total clichÃ©.

40:32.420 --> 40:33.787
That is so cute.

40:33.822 --> 40:34.587
Cute?

40:34.623 --> 40:35.288
Yeah.

40:35.323 --> 40:36.289
He didn't even know I existed.

40:36.324 --> 40:39.059
Well, he does now.

40:39.094 --> 40:41.862
Ok, I'm gonna go pick up that
box of spiced ham

40:41.897 --> 40:42.963
and I'm gonna be right back.

40:42.998 --> 40:43.864
Ok?

40:43.899 --> 40:44.798
Ok.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.199
That was incredibly awkward.

40:46.234 --> 40:47.034
[laughs]

40:47.069 --> 40:48.769
I'd actually say you're
a real hit.

40:48.804 --> 40:51.038
Your cupcakes are almost gone.

40:55.077 --> 40:56.476
He's still a good guy.

40:56.511 --> 40:59.646
Yeah, unfortunately.

40:59.682 --> 41:00.881
He's been a huge help
with the website and um...

41:00.916 --> 41:05.485
No one tells you how to handle
this after all these years.

41:05.520 --> 41:08.454
There's no rule book.

41:08.490 --> 41:10.423
You know, I've spent a lot of
time lately talking to people

41:10.458 --> 41:12.125
about the old community hall.

41:12.161 --> 41:16.462
People with very strong opinions
about how it should be restored.

41:16.498 --> 41:18.665
But the way I see it, you just
need to acknowledge

41:18.701 --> 41:22.769
what it was and enjoy it
for what it is now.

41:22.805 --> 41:26.740
There is no rule, you just have
to do what feels right.

41:26.775 --> 41:29.142
Thank you.

41:29.178 --> 41:32.645
Ok, we have a dozen
cupcakes left.

41:32.681 --> 41:33.413
We can do this.

41:33.448 --> 41:34.147
Let's do it.

41:34.183 --> 41:35.215
Cupcakes.

41:44.693 --> 41:47.427
I have to say, I'm even
impressing myself.

41:47.462 --> 41:50.964
Well, we've got three more
to go so knock yourself out.

41:50.999 --> 41:53.533
Yeah. You know what's missing?

41:53.568 --> 41:56.302
Don't you dare say
chocolate velvet.

41:56.338 --> 41:56.937
No.

41:56.972 --> 41:57.738
No, I wasn't gonna say it.

41:57.773 --> 42:00.473
I wasn't even thinking it.
At all.

42:02.711 --> 42:04.677
Oh, I can't believe
it's all happening.

42:04.713 --> 42:05.846
Tomorrow.

42:05.881 --> 42:07.214
I feel sick to my stomach.

42:07.249 --> 42:08.381
And I don't even know
what to say

42:08.416 --> 42:09.549
about the whole franchise thing.

42:09.584 --> 42:11.151
It's a lot of pressure.

42:11.186 --> 42:13.220
Just be true to yourself.

42:13.255 --> 42:16.790
And know that you're gonna have
a killer website to show.

42:16.825 --> 42:20.060
Maybe not until 2:00 am
but still.

42:20.095 --> 42:21.962
I still can't believe that these
are from your phone.

42:21.997 --> 42:23.363
They're beautiful.

42:23.398 --> 42:25.498
Just wait until I'm done
editing them.

42:28.237 --> 42:28.969
Wait, what're you doing?

42:29.004 --> 42:31.337
No, stop.

42:34.276 --> 42:35.876
See?

42:35.911 --> 42:38.245
Beautiful.

42:38.280 --> 42:39.579
Nate.

42:39.614 --> 42:40.380
Ok.

42:40.415 --> 42:42.382
I know. I know.

42:42.417 --> 42:44.350
Back to work.

42:49.758 --> 43:00.333
â™ª

43:00.368 --> 43:05.538
<i>â™ª I searched the whole world</i>
<i>three times over â™ª</i>

43:05.573 --> 43:10.677
<i>â™ª Through every closed</i>
<i>and open door â™ª</i>

43:10.712 --> 43:14.881
<i>â™ª I didn't even know</i>
<i>what I was looking for â™ª</i>

43:14.917 --> 43:16.183
<i>â™ª That was the moment â™ª</i>

43:16.218 --> 43:20.020
<i>â™ª when I knew</i>
<i>I found you â™ª</i>

43:20.055 --> 43:25.225
<i>â™ª</i>

43:25.260 --> 43:29.029
<i>â™ª I found love, I found love,</i>
<i>I found love â™ª</i>

43:29.064 --> 43:31.298
<i>â™ª so true â™ª</i>

43:31.333 --> 43:35.635
â™ª

43:35.670 --> 43:41.808
<i>â™ª I found love, I found love,</i>
<i>I found love in you â™ª</i>

43:41.844 --> 43:52.585
<i>â™ª</i>

43:52.620 --> 43:57.991
<i>â™ª Now I don't know life</i>
<i>without you â™ª</i>

43:58.026 --> 44:02.829
<i>â™ª Since you fell</i>
<i>into my world â™ª</i>

44:02.865 --> 44:07.067
<i>â™ª You know the words to</i>
<i>the story I've been told â™ª</i>

44:07.102 --> 44:12.272
<i>â™ª That was the moment</i>
<i>I knew I found you â™ª</i>

44:18.146 --> 44:18.644
You know, I was thinking...

44:18.680 --> 44:20.013
[gasps]

44:20.048 --> 44:21.915
Ok, that was way too easy
to sneak up on you.

44:21.950 --> 44:22.782
Good morning.

44:22.817 --> 44:24.117
Morning.

44:24.152 --> 44:25.285
How long have you been here?

44:25.320 --> 44:26.920
Do you really wanna know?

44:26.955 --> 44:27.820
Wow.

44:27.856 --> 44:29.522
I thought I was early.

44:29.557 --> 44:30.590
It smells amazing in here.

44:30.625 --> 44:32.959
Well, I decided to make
a dozen maple buttermilk,

44:32.995 --> 44:34.861
that's her favorite and
she's getting plenty of it.

44:34.897 --> 44:37.330
And then three dozen of
everything else.

44:37.366 --> 44:38.265
Have you slept at all?

44:38.300 --> 44:39.532
Oh no, I can sleep tomorrow.

44:39.567 --> 44:41.467
Today Christine Benoa is coming
to the cafe

44:41.503 --> 44:43.937
and everything needs
to be perfect.

44:43.972 --> 44:45.272
I don't look tired, do I?

44:45.307 --> 44:46.839
You look great.

44:46.875 --> 44:48.275
So what can I do for you?

44:48.310 --> 44:50.877
Oh, yes, um, can you go check on
the cupcakes?

44:50.913 --> 44:53.113
I'm just looking over the
business plan one more time.

44:53.148 --> 44:54.814
I'm on it.

45:01.589 --> 45:03.156
<i>Oh no.</i>

45:03.191 --> 45:04.124
What?

45:04.159 --> 45:05.125
What's wrong?

45:05.160 --> 45:06.192
It's the cupcakes!

45:06.228 --> 45:07.193
They're a little burned.

45:07.229 --> 45:08.628
What?

45:08.663 --> 45:09.695
No, not burned, crispy, crispy.

45:09.731 --> 45:10.630
Just crispy.

45:10.665 --> 45:12.332
They can't be crispy,
they're cupcakes.

45:12.367 --> 45:13.400
I know, I'm sorry.

45:13.435 --> 45:14.367
I don't know what to say.

45:14.403 --> 45:15.068
No, no, no, no.

45:15.103 --> 45:18.138
I'm sorry, it's- it's that oven.

45:18.173 --> 45:19.406
I need to re-do them.

45:19.441 --> 45:20.240
What- re-do all of them?

45:20.275 --> 45:21.474
Where? How?

45:21.509 --> 45:22.142
At home.

45:22.177 --> 45:22.809
What other choice do I have?

45:22.844 --> 45:24.377
She's gonna be here at 9:00.

45:24.413 --> 45:25.812
You can't do this
all by yourself.

45:25.847 --> 45:27.080
There's not enough time.

45:27.115 --> 45:28.248
What if I come with you?

45:28.283 --> 45:29.316
Who's gonna run the shop
when it opens?

45:29.351 --> 45:31.051
I don't know, but I'm
the only one who knows how

45:31.086 --> 45:33.219
to help you with these.

45:33.255 --> 45:35.989
Actually, you're not.

45:36.024 --> 45:37.390
Ok.

45:43.731 --> 45:45.498
Hi, uh, Nate?

45:45.533 --> 45:46.566
It's me.

45:46.601 --> 45:50.403
Um, I know it's early
and I hate to ask but uh,

45:50.439 --> 45:53.073
I really need your help.

45:55.981 --> 45:58.644
Ok, so we need to make six dozen
cupcakes for the cafe

45:58.694 --> 46:00.527
and another four for the super
important investor

46:00.562 --> 46:01.728
who's probably already
on her way

46:01.763 --> 46:03.496
and I don't even think there's
enough time in this timer.

46:03.532 --> 46:05.165
Ok, stop.

46:05.201 --> 46:05.899
Deep breath.

46:05.935 --> 46:07.801
[breathes deeply]

46:07.837 --> 46:08.735
We got this.

46:08.770 --> 46:10.470
We got plenty of space.

46:13.209 --> 46:14.708
Maddie?

46:14.743 --> 46:16.576
Yeah, I'm just screaming inside.

46:16.611 --> 46:18.812
Just a little bit.

46:24.119 --> 46:24.885
Better?

46:24.920 --> 46:26.920
Mmmhmm.

46:26.956 --> 46:28.555
We got this.

46:28.590 --> 46:30.690
We can do this.

46:31.894 --> 46:41.969
<i>â™ª</i>

46:41.971 --> 46:51.211
<i>â™ª</i>

46:51.247 --> 46:54.114
<i>â™ª There's no distance</i>
<i>in between â™ª</i>

46:54.149 --> 46:56.583
<i>â™ª Darling you and me â™ª</i>

46:56.618 --> 47:00.754
<i>â™ª Make this thing complete â™ª</i>

47:00.789 --> 47:03.456
<i>â™ª We go drifting out to sea â™ª</i>

47:03.492 --> 47:06.126
<i>â™ª Making memories â™ª</i>

47:06.161 --> 47:08.195
â™ª Honey's oh so sweet â™ª

47:08.230 --> 47:09.396
[laughing]

47:09.431 --> 47:13.633
â™ª<i> You'll always hold on</i> â™ª

47:13.668 --> 47:18.071
â™ª<i> Praying I won't</i>
<i>move along</i> â™ª

47:18.107 --> 47:22.809
â™ª<i> I always hold on</i> â™ª

47:22.844 --> 47:26.980
â™ª<i> Hoping you'll miss</i>
<i>me when I'm gone</i> â™ª

47:27.016 --> 47:32.485
â™ª<i> So won't you follow me</i> â™ª

47:32.521 --> 47:36.656
â™ª<i> Follow me</i> â™ª

47:36.691 --> 47:40.093
â™ª<i> So won't you follow me</i> â™ª

47:40.129 --> 47:42.963
You were right, this space
is a total life-saver.

47:42.998 --> 47:44.564
Thank you.

47:44.599 --> 47:47.634
And your french toast flakes
are pretty perfect.

47:47.669 --> 47:50.137
Maybe I should reconsider
my profession.

47:50.172 --> 47:52.272
I still can't believe
you're a cardiologist.

47:52.308 --> 47:53.640
I mean, that's insane.

47:53.675 --> 47:55.108
Would it be any more insane
if I told you

47:55.144 --> 47:58.178
that my heart really
lies in research?

47:58.213 --> 48:00.647
Did you just make a really
bad medical pun?

48:00.715 --> 48:04.017
Maybe, but I love it.

48:04.053 --> 48:05.685
Did you know there's this
small town in Italy

48:05.720 --> 48:08.121
where nobody has heart attacks?

48:08.157 --> 48:09.089
No one.

48:09.124 --> 48:10.324
It's crazy how much
you can learn from that

48:10.359 --> 48:13.260
and it's even crazier to think
that if this grant goes through

48:13.295 --> 48:14.761
there's gonna be a whole
new research program

48:14.796 --> 48:17.431
for people like me
to geek out on.

48:20.302 --> 48:21.301
What?

48:21.337 --> 48:22.169
And just think.

48:22.204 --> 48:26.639
At 18 you were gunning
for advertising.

48:26.675 --> 48:28.675
I'm pretty sure that thing
dings when it's time.

48:28.710 --> 48:29.776
Uh, yeah.

48:29.811 --> 48:32.279
I just- I can't risk burning
any more cupcakes today.

48:32.314 --> 48:33.947
Do you want me to do
the cinnamon crumble?

48:33.983 --> 48:36.283
Wow, you remember all this
like it was yesterday.

48:36.318 --> 48:38.551
I was your stand-in sous chef
for how many years?

48:38.587 --> 48:40.287
But still, it was
a long time ago.

48:40.322 --> 48:42.289
Some things you never forget.

48:46.528 --> 48:48.528
I'm sorry, Maddie.

48:48.563 --> 48:49.596
For everything.

48:52.767 --> 48:54.701
You know what?
It's fine.

48:54.736 --> 48:56.203
We're fine.

48:56.238 --> 48:57.404
[ding]

48:57.439 --> 48:58.538
Are we?

48:58.573 --> 49:00.974
Well, no, not if you keep
distracting me like this.

49:01.010 --> 49:03.477
I gotta get those
out of the oven.

49:10.219 --> 49:11.318
You were right.

49:11.353 --> 49:13.153
They're pretty perfect.

49:13.188 --> 49:16.089
So we're really fine?

49:16.125 --> 49:18.158
Well, fine-ish.

49:18.193 --> 49:23.063
Does this mean that we can
officially be friends now?

49:23.098 --> 49:24.297
Oh, come on.

49:24.333 --> 49:28.201
It's a small town, you're gonna
have to see me around, anyway.

49:28.237 --> 49:30.837
Ok, I guess we can give it a go.

49:30.872 --> 49:32.072
Really?

49:32.107 --> 49:34.174
Under one condition.

49:34.209 --> 49:36.510
Less talking, more frosting.

49:36.545 --> 49:38.545
We gotta get back in an hour.

49:38.580 --> 49:40.113
Where's my spatula?

49:40.149 --> 49:42.182
Over there.
Go grab it.

49:50.926 --> 49:54.861
Nate, I'll admit I was a little
nervous when she called you.

49:54.896 --> 49:57.564
Now I'm just nervous
you're gonna take my job.

49:57.599 --> 49:59.399
Impossible.

49:59.435 --> 50:01.268
But I do think it went
pretty well.

50:01.303 --> 50:03.036
Oh, this is not good.

50:03.072 --> 50:04.071
Please don't say that.

50:04.106 --> 50:05.738
What's wrong?

50:05.774 --> 50:07.374
I didn't think about the time.

50:07.409 --> 50:08.608
What do you mean?

50:08.643 --> 50:10.110
It's too quiet in here.

50:10.145 --> 50:12.612
No one gets a cupcake at 9:00
on a Monday morning.

50:12.647 --> 50:14.481
Why did I say yes to 9:00?

50:14.516 --> 50:15.315
She's a smart woman.

50:15.350 --> 50:16.516
I'm sure she knows that.

50:16.552 --> 50:18.585
Besides, it's not like there's
a lot of seating in here.

50:18.620 --> 50:19.619
You only get one shot at this.

50:19.654 --> 50:20.820
I think you're right.

50:20.855 --> 50:23.056
We need warm bodies in here
or it might look kinda sad.

50:23.092 --> 50:26.593
Ok, Nate, um, can you just stay
here and drink coffee?

50:26.628 --> 50:28.795
That's the beauty of only having
one lecture a week.

50:28.830 --> 50:30.397
I got plenty of time to loiter.

50:30.432 --> 50:32.799
I'm gonna call Sarah,
see if she can come down.

50:32.834 --> 50:34.101
We're only two people.

50:34.136 --> 50:35.602
I don't think that's gonna
do much.

50:35.637 --> 50:37.637
Do you have a better idea?

50:47.782 --> 50:49.216
Who wants a free cupcake?

50:50.819 --> 50:51.318
Great.

50:51.353 --> 50:52.385
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

50:56.958 --> 50:59.859
Alright, everyone
have a seat.

50:59.894 --> 51:02.162
Cupcakes on me.

51:22.551 --> 51:23.583
Thank you.

51:26.188 --> 51:27.820
Hi Christine. Welcome.

51:27.856 --> 51:28.788
Thank you.

51:28.823 --> 51:29.956
Ok, be honest.

51:29.991 --> 51:32.792
Is it too early for a fresh
maple buttermilk cupcake?

51:32.827 --> 51:36.129
Ooh, not if it comes with a
very strong side of coffee.

51:36.165 --> 51:37.063
I'm on it.

51:37.098 --> 51:39.999
I'm going to take a look around.
Excuse me.

51:40.035 --> 51:41.234
It's good to see you, Maddie.

51:41.270 --> 51:43.102
Good to see you, too.

51:47.008 --> 51:50.577
So, you're really trying this
whole friends thing out?

51:50.612 --> 51:53.913
I just- I want what's best
for her.

51:53.948 --> 51:57.417
I hate to say it, I kinda
believe you.

51:57.452 --> 51:59.986
How long are you in town for?

52:00.021 --> 52:01.754
Sorry, what?

52:01.790 --> 52:05.492
This is a temporary work stop,
right?

52:05.527 --> 52:07.694
Yeah, I guess it is.

52:07.729 --> 52:08.428
Christine, please.

52:08.463 --> 52:09.596
Right this way.

52:09.631 --> 52:10.930
Let me show you.

52:10.965 --> 52:12.265
The ovens and the coffee maker

52:12.301 --> 52:14.067
have been really
kind to us through the years

52:14.102 --> 52:16.769
but their days
are definitely numbered.

52:16.805 --> 52:18.672
Ah, so new equipment.

52:18.707 --> 52:20.340
Yes, that's our first priority.

52:24.546 --> 52:26.713
I don't get it.

52:26.748 --> 52:28.348
Well, it's good to see
that it's so busy,

52:28.383 --> 52:29.449
even in the morning.

52:29.484 --> 52:32.252
Actually, lunch and after school
is our busiest time

52:32.287 --> 52:36.055
but today's been a good day.

52:37.926 --> 52:39.226
Anything else I should know?

52:39.261 --> 52:41.428
Well, the website is up
as of late last night

52:41.463 --> 52:43.062
and I have to say it looks
pretty amazing.

52:43.098 --> 52:44.030
Great.

52:44.065 --> 52:44.931
Well, send me a link
and I'll check it out.

52:44.966 --> 52:45.765
Ok.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.300
Uh, it's all updated
in the proposal,

52:47.336 --> 52:48.635
along with the numbers.

52:48.670 --> 52:50.069
My best friend is
an interior designer

52:50.105 --> 52:51.871
so we would be in good hands.

52:51.906 --> 52:54.307
And her fiancÃ© is a contractor.

52:54.343 --> 53:00.146
So, easy for an expansion here
but in terms of franchising...

53:00.181 --> 53:05.785
I'm sorry, can I... can I be
completely honest with you?

53:05.820 --> 53:08.988
Well, you know I
appreciate that.

53:09.023 --> 53:10.923
If the right place comes along,

53:10.959 --> 53:14.994
something exciting like-
like this,

53:15.029 --> 53:18.465
of course I'd be open to
a franchise but for now

53:18.500 --> 53:22.068
I just really want to improve
the original.

53:22.103 --> 53:24.003
Keep the personal touch.

53:24.038 --> 53:28.341
So I just can't promise you
anything beyond that.

53:28.377 --> 53:30.410
<i>Not until I'm 100 percent.</i>

53:31.880 --> 53:32.912
Hmm.

53:41.790 --> 53:43.456
Well, it's probably not what
I would have said

53:43.492 --> 53:46.526
but I am about
bigger and better.

53:46.561 --> 53:48.628
She seemed to really admire
your integrity.

53:48.664 --> 53:51.130
Well, I guess we'll see
by this weekend.

53:51.166 --> 53:52.999
Hey, we should
celebrate tonight.

53:53.034 --> 53:53.600
Tonight?

53:53.635 --> 53:54.467
Yeah.

53:54.503 --> 53:56.836
Don't you think
it's a little premature?

53:56.871 --> 53:58.004
You put it all out there,
you worked hard,

53:58.039 --> 53:59.306
I think that's something
to celebrate.

53:59.341 --> 54:00.573
Don't you?

54:02.210 --> 54:05.244
Unless you've got other plans.

54:08.383 --> 54:09.683
Uh, no.

54:09.718 --> 54:10.483
Ok.

54:10.519 --> 54:11.518
Great.

54:11.553 --> 54:13.520
I'll send a car for you at 5:00.

54:13.555 --> 54:15.922
Sounds perfect.

54:33.419 --> 54:35.519
You didn't have to bring me
all the way to Chicago.

54:35.555 --> 54:36.921
I would have been fine
with pizza.

54:36.956 --> 54:38.188
Or anything, really.

54:38.223 --> 54:39.723
It's a celebration, isn't it?

54:39.759 --> 54:42.359
How do you feel about oysters?

54:42.394 --> 54:43.794
Excuse me.

54:43.829 --> 54:46.229
Could we start with a dozen
Bay King oysters,

54:46.265 --> 54:50.067
tuna tartare, and the rest
we are still deciding.

54:50.102 --> 54:51.702
Thank you.

54:52.638 --> 54:53.904
Wow.

54:53.940 --> 54:55.940
Fancy.

54:55.975 --> 54:56.941
Well, if I had more time

54:56.976 --> 54:59.276
I would have made reservations
at La Colonial.

54:59.311 --> 54:59.944
No.

54:59.979 --> 55:00.611
No, no, no.

55:00.646 --> 55:02.046
This is perfect.

55:02.081 --> 55:04.615
I'm still under dressed, so...

55:04.650 --> 55:08.786
You are perfect.

55:11.190 --> 55:15.092
To a very good day and
a very promising start.

55:15.127 --> 55:16.460
To the venture.

55:16.495 --> 55:17.962
To everything.

55:17.997 --> 55:20.363
Especially us.

55:25.471 --> 55:27.605
Am I losing my mind?

55:27.640 --> 55:29.406
I- I wanna feel something, I do,

55:29.441 --> 55:32.109
I just- I also feel like we're
really different.

55:32.144 --> 55:34.645
And you know, the timing
is all wrong.

55:34.680 --> 55:37.815
I just- I need to focus
on the cafe.

55:37.850 --> 55:40.618
I don't think the cafe has
anything to do with this.

55:40.653 --> 55:41.418
Oh, no.

55:41.453 --> 55:42.786
This has nothing to do
with Nate.

55:42.822 --> 55:44.755
We're just friends.

55:44.790 --> 55:47.691
Besides, that's another
impossible situation.

55:47.727 --> 55:51.261
So you don't want to be
with him?

55:51.296 --> 55:53.797
Maybe I need to stick
to the original plan.

55:53.833 --> 55:55.465
Focus all my energy into work.

55:55.501 --> 55:56.834
That'll work out better.

55:56.869 --> 55:59.136
I wish it were that easy.

55:59.171 --> 56:00.137
What?

56:00.172 --> 56:01.972
Deciding when and where
you wanna fall in love.

56:02.008 --> 56:04.374
I'm not falling for Nate again.

56:04.409 --> 56:05.475
I know.

56:05.511 --> 56:07.711
That's because you never fell
out of love with him

56:07.747 --> 56:09.780
in the first place.

56:09.815 --> 56:12.750
I just didn't realize it
until now.

56:35.074 --> 56:38.108
Focus, Maddie.
Just... just focus.

56:41.413 --> 56:43.513
This is going to be
the perfect wedding.

56:43.549 --> 56:45.182
I really like this venue.

56:55.895 --> 56:56.727
Wow.

56:56.762 --> 56:58.862
This is even better
than I remember.

56:58.898 --> 57:00.664
Yeah, the pictures you sent
were great

57:00.700 --> 57:04.735
but in person it's stunning.

57:04.770 --> 57:06.770
It looks nice.

57:06.806 --> 57:09.173
Still no word from Christine?

57:09.208 --> 57:10.007
Mmm-mmm.

57:10.042 --> 57:10.774
Don't worry.

57:10.810 --> 57:11.742
It's still early.

57:11.777 --> 57:14.578
So, what do you think?

57:14.613 --> 57:16.080
This place?

57:16.115 --> 57:17.081
Eh, it could work.

57:17.116 --> 57:18.716
Work?

57:18.751 --> 57:20.250
Are you serious?

57:20.285 --> 57:21.085
This is our wedding day.

57:21.120 --> 57:23.587
It needs to do more
than just work.

57:23.622 --> 57:26.623
Actually, I- I should get back
to the bakery.

57:26.658 --> 57:28.092
Call me?

57:30.295 --> 57:33.764
Luke, I love you, I do.

57:33.799 --> 57:35.298
You say that nothing's going on

57:35.334 --> 57:38.769
but something is so you need
to figure it out.

57:38.804 --> 57:41.538
Cause I don't wanna feel
this way anymore.

57:41.573 --> 57:42.740
No, nothing-

57:48.013 --> 57:49.412
She said she'd call
by the weekend

57:49.448 --> 57:51.615
and it's almost 5:00.

57:51.650 --> 57:52.649
Well, it is Friday.

57:52.684 --> 57:54.952
Maybe she's busy.

57:54.987 --> 57:57.788
Or she's about to leave
for the weekend.

57:57.823 --> 58:00.423
I think I'll call her.

58:00.459 --> 58:02.793
Don't you think
that's a little...

58:02.828 --> 58:03.727
ok, it's not pushy.

58:03.763 --> 58:05.929
It's just, uh... assertive.

58:05.965 --> 58:09.499
Hi, this is Maddie Strong
for Christine Benoa.

58:09.534 --> 58:10.801
Hey, I was just going
to call you.

58:10.836 --> 58:11.635
Hi.

58:11.670 --> 58:12.669
I'm so sorry to bother you,
I just-

58:12.704 --> 58:14.638
I didn't want to miss you
before the weekend.

58:14.673 --> 58:15.505
Oh, no, no.

58:15.540 --> 58:17.274
I've already come home
for the weekend.

58:17.309 --> 58:18.242
It's fine.

58:18.277 --> 58:19.977
You're anxious, I get it.

58:20.012 --> 58:23.446
So I will make this as quick
and painless as possible.

58:23.482 --> 58:27.484
<i>I took a look at your website.</i>
<i>Um, well, I love it.</i>

58:27.519 --> 58:31.655
It's artistic and easy to use,
which is a bonus for me,

58:31.690 --> 58:34.992
and as much as my brain
naturally wants to franchise

58:35.027 --> 58:36.593
I think you're right.

58:36.628 --> 58:38.929
We should elevate
what you already have,

58:38.964 --> 58:43.100
<i>expand next door, and we'll see</i>
<i>where we want to go from there.</i>

58:43.135 --> 58:44.168
Really?

58:44.203 --> 58:45.635
Thank you so much.

58:45.671 --> 58:47.337
You're welcome.

58:47.372 --> 58:48.405
Bye.

58:48.808 --> 58:49.606
Well?

58:49.641 --> 58:50.507
We got it!

58:50.542 --> 58:51.809
We got the deal!

58:51.844 --> 58:53.177
[squealing]

58:53.212 --> 58:53.944
This is so exciting!

58:53.979 --> 58:54.812
I know!

58:54.847 --> 58:56.814
She said she loved
the website, too.

58:56.849 --> 58:58.282
Ok, we have to celebrate.

58:58.317 --> 58:59.216
What do you think?

58:59.251 --> 59:02.652
Champagne at the Horizon
or pizza at Lou's?

59:02.688 --> 59:05.655
Or you wanna thank somebody
for their help?

59:05.691 --> 59:06.290
What?

59:06.325 --> 59:08.125
What're you talking about?

59:08.160 --> 59:10.194
He was the first person you
called after all these years

59:10.229 --> 59:12.462
and he was right there for you.

59:12.497 --> 59:14.198
I love you, Maddie,
but you don't need to know

59:14.233 --> 59:17.801
where everything is going
before you get there.

59:19.071 --> 59:22.105
He's not gonna be here forever.

59:42.427 --> 59:44.594
As doctors we're lucky.

59:44.629 --> 59:45.829
We have a family.

59:45.865 --> 59:47.197
A community.

59:47.233 --> 59:52.903
We feel linked by what we do.

59:52.938 --> 59:55.572
But not everyone has that.

59:55.607 --> 59:59.276
Not everyone has
that special someone.

59:59.311 --> 01:00:02.112
Or maybe they did
and they lost them.

01:00:02.147 --> 01:00:04.281
Either way, while they're
under our care,

01:00:04.316 --> 01:00:08.551
our patients need to feel like
they're a part of our community.

01:00:08.587 --> 01:00:12.222
And if you ask me, Indian Lake
is a pretty amazing community

01:00:12.258 --> 01:00:14.424
to be a part of.

01:00:14.459 --> 01:00:15.558
Thank you.

01:00:15.594 --> 01:00:18.595
[applause]

01:00:24.303 --> 01:00:26.937
You're getting pretty good at
this lecturing thing.

01:00:26.972 --> 01:00:28.571
You got it, didn't you?

01:00:28.607 --> 01:00:29.373
You got the deal?

01:00:29.408 --> 01:00:30.908
Yes.

01:00:35.948 --> 01:00:39.616
Hey, you uh, you still up
for that hike?

01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:40.550
Yes.

01:00:40.585 --> 01:00:41.651
Yeah?

01:00:41.686 --> 01:00:43.553
One hundred percent.

01:01:04.467 --> 01:01:05.432
What's in the bag?

01:01:05.468 --> 01:01:07.234
You'll see.

01:01:08.972 --> 01:01:11.005
Don't worry about it.

01:01:25.688 --> 01:01:28.756
All these years later.

01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:30.625
It's still perfect.

01:01:33.195 --> 01:01:35.095
That's why this is it.

01:01:35.131 --> 01:01:36.631
Is what?

01:01:36.666 --> 01:01:39.266
The inspiration for the cafe.

01:01:39.301 --> 01:01:42.803
I remember coming out here
for a hike not too long

01:01:42.839 --> 01:01:47.008
after we broke up so the lake
was a little hard for me still.

01:01:47.043 --> 01:01:49.577
And then I got here
and it surprised me.

01:01:49.612 --> 01:01:52.179
The view, this- this spot.

01:01:52.214 --> 01:01:54.982
It's beautiful.

01:01:55.018 --> 01:01:56.817
And that's when it hit me.

01:01:56.853 --> 01:01:59.954
I could still have my dream
right here in Indian Lake.

01:01:59.989 --> 01:02:01.989
So you decided to go for it?

01:02:02.025 --> 01:02:03.524
Yeah.

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.627
I started saving up
the next day.

01:02:06.663 --> 01:02:08.462
Baking out of my kitchen.

01:02:08.497 --> 01:02:12.633
Selling anywhere I could.

01:02:12.669 --> 01:02:15.102
I didn't think you could get
any more amazing,

01:02:15.137 --> 01:02:17.304
but you have.

01:02:17.339 --> 01:02:18.439
I don't know about that.

01:02:18.474 --> 01:02:20.140
I do.

01:02:25.014 --> 01:02:26.047
You got me a cupcake?

01:02:26.082 --> 01:02:27.514
Not just any.

01:02:28.885 --> 01:02:30.317
Chocolate velvet?

01:02:31.888 --> 01:02:35.355
This is the best thank you ever.

01:02:39.428 --> 01:02:40.461
Sorry.

01:02:42.765 --> 01:02:45.666
I just... these last few weeks,

01:02:45.702 --> 01:02:49.136
I didn't expect to feel
all this.

01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:52.039
But it's all still right there.

01:02:52.075 --> 01:02:53.240
I know.

01:02:53.275 --> 01:02:56.210
You do? Really?

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.415
Well, what if this is just
nostalgia what we're feeling?

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:04.752
Then we'll find out.

01:03:04.787 --> 01:03:07.354
I know it's a lot to process.

01:03:07.389 --> 01:03:10.390
I just want to spend
more time together.

01:03:10.426 --> 01:03:14.729
I can still picture growing old
with you.

01:03:14.764 --> 01:03:18.532
That's never changed
after all these years.

01:03:18.567 --> 01:03:24.338
It just took me coming back here
to finally realize it.

01:03:24.373 --> 01:03:28.342
You only have two more weeks
of work.

01:03:28.377 --> 01:03:32.046
Maybe I can stay on.

01:03:32.081 --> 01:03:33.213
Don't say that, Nate.

01:03:33.249 --> 01:03:34.281
Not if you don't mean it.

01:03:34.316 --> 01:03:35.616
They need cardiologists here.

01:03:35.652 --> 01:03:37.584
They've already mentioned it.

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:41.689
I just have to find the right
moment to bring it up.

01:03:41.724 --> 01:03:44.191
What do you say?

01:03:44.226 --> 01:03:46.627
Can we at least try?

01:03:46.663 --> 01:03:48.696
And see?

01:03:55.404 --> 01:03:58.305
No, I think that's a great
direction to go.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.206
Hi.

01:03:59.241 --> 01:04:00.941
Thanks, Steven.

01:04:00.977 --> 01:04:02.910
You signed the deal, didn't you?

01:04:02.945 --> 01:04:04.879
Construction starts next week.

01:04:04.914 --> 01:04:05.813
Can you believe it?

01:04:05.848 --> 01:04:06.881
That is amazing.

01:04:06.916 --> 01:04:09.750
Maddie, congratulations.

01:04:09.786 --> 01:04:11.285
I think we should
really celebrate now.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.820
La Colonial?

01:04:12.855 --> 01:04:14.822
I'm sorry, Alex.

01:04:14.857 --> 01:04:18.893
I just- I- I just wanted to come
talk to you in person.

01:04:18.928 --> 01:04:22.329
You just want pizza?

01:04:22.364 --> 01:04:25.399
Look, you're amazing.

01:04:25.434 --> 01:04:28.602
And you deserve someone
who wants what you want.

01:04:28.637 --> 01:04:31.238
Who loves what you love.

01:04:31.273 --> 01:04:34.441
I just don't think that
that's me.

01:04:34.476 --> 01:04:36.276
It's ok.

01:04:36.312 --> 01:04:37.678
I get it.

01:04:37.714 --> 01:04:40.014
I'm sorry.

01:04:40.049 --> 01:04:44.819
Some things just work out
better than others, right?

01:04:44.854 --> 01:04:47.188
Yeah, I guess they do.

01:04:47.223 --> 01:04:49.857
Will you still be able to come
to the re-opening,

01:04:49.892 --> 01:04:51.959
whenever that is?

01:04:51.994 --> 01:04:53.194
I will try.

01:04:53.229 --> 01:04:54.361
How's that?

01:04:54.396 --> 01:04:56.964
That's good.

01:04:56.999 --> 01:04:58.665
Bye.

01:05:00.803 --> 01:05:01.969
Hi, how are you?

01:05:02.004 --> 01:05:03.637
Good.

01:05:03.672 --> 01:05:04.872
Morning. Welcome.

01:05:04.907 --> 01:05:06.741
Pass that down over there.

01:05:08.077 --> 01:05:09.676
I can't believe the walls
are coming down.

01:05:09.712 --> 01:05:10.978
It's all happening.

01:05:11.013 --> 01:05:13.180
It certainly is.

01:05:13.216 --> 01:05:15.216
I am so happy for you.

01:05:15.251 --> 01:05:17.184
Well, the big re-opening
is gonna be

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:18.385
a big coming out for you.

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:19.620
It's gonna look amazing.

01:05:19.655 --> 01:05:21.288
I meant about that.

01:05:21.323 --> 01:05:22.990
Oh.

01:05:23.926 --> 01:05:26.961
Do you think I'm crazy about
giving him another chance?

01:05:26.996 --> 01:05:28.695
I mean, I don't know
how it's gonna go, but-

01:05:28.731 --> 01:05:30.164
Hey.

01:05:30.199 --> 01:05:32.466
Are you happy?

01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:34.034
I am.

01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:35.302
Then trust in that.

01:05:35.337 --> 01:05:38.639
Well, I should say
the same to you.

01:05:38.674 --> 01:05:41.675
I think it's time to break
the ground.

01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:44.812
Is that the right saying?

01:05:44.847 --> 01:05:46.413
No.

01:05:46.448 --> 01:05:47.481
Ok.

01:05:52.721 --> 01:05:53.888
It's amazing.

01:05:53.923 --> 01:05:55.422
I don't even need coffee here.

01:05:55.457 --> 01:05:57.557
The cold air just wakes
you right up.

01:05:57.593 --> 01:05:59.493
I forgot how much I missed that.

01:05:59.528 --> 01:06:01.395
Oh, I need coffee.

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:02.696
Lots of coffee.

01:06:02.731 --> 01:06:04.564
[chuckles]

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.233
You look happy today.

01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:07.868
You trying to say I don't look
happy other days?

01:06:07.904 --> 01:06:08.936
You know what I mean.

01:06:08.971 --> 01:06:10.737
It must be all that good pizza
I've been eating.

01:06:10.773 --> 01:06:12.739
Yeah, somehow I don't think
that's what it is.

01:06:12.775 --> 01:06:13.874
You know what?

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:16.944
You're right. It's not.

01:06:16.979 --> 01:06:17.544
Dr. Caldwell.

01:06:17.579 --> 01:06:18.545
Nate.

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:19.746
Sorry, I was uh, I was hoping

01:06:19.782 --> 01:06:20.714
I could talk to you
about something.

01:06:20.749 --> 01:06:21.581
It's important.

01:06:21.617 --> 01:06:22.382
Well, great timing.

01:06:22.418 --> 01:06:23.550
I'm sorry?

01:06:23.585 --> 01:06:25.286
Well, I want to talk to you
about something, as well.

01:06:25.321 --> 01:06:26.153
The grant went through

01:06:26.189 --> 01:06:28.289
for Dr. Langston's
research program.

01:06:28.324 --> 01:06:32.059
He's asking for you
in Boston right away.

01:06:34.096 --> 01:06:35.296
So he just called this morning?

01:06:35.331 --> 01:06:38.199
He said he wanted to run it
by me first just to make sure

01:06:38.234 --> 01:06:40.067
I was ok with it.

01:06:40.102 --> 01:06:41.302
With my leaving early?

01:06:41.337 --> 01:06:44.138
Just cutting your course a week
short so that you could take

01:06:44.173 --> 01:06:46.606
advantage of this
great opportunity.

01:06:46.642 --> 01:06:48.775
Phil will give you all
the details this afternoon.

01:06:48.811 --> 01:06:51.078
Nate, you deserve this.

01:06:51.113 --> 01:06:53.280
I just never thought that
this would happen so soon.

01:06:53.316 --> 01:06:54.548
Well, it has.

01:06:54.583 --> 01:06:56.383
And as long as you're willing
to start pretty immediately.

01:06:56.418 --> 01:06:57.318
How immediately?

01:06:57.353 --> 01:06:59.386
Training starts Monday.

01:07:00.689 --> 01:07:01.722
Monday?

01:07:04.493 --> 01:07:06.460
Are you ok?

01:07:06.495 --> 01:07:08.329
I'm sorry.

01:07:08.364 --> 01:07:12.632
This just is not how I thought
today was gonna go.

01:07:12.668 --> 01:07:15.135
Wait, you said you wanted
to talk to me about something,

01:07:15.171 --> 01:07:18.339
as well, didn't you?

01:07:18.374 --> 01:07:19.806
I did.

01:07:19.842 --> 01:07:22.476
So what is it?

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.074
What do you think?

01:07:34.109 --> 01:07:36.342
You look beautiful.

01:07:36.377 --> 01:07:37.944
About the cupcake.

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:40.981
It might be a tad sweet.

01:07:41.016 --> 01:07:44.517
Thank you for always being
honest with me.

01:07:44.552 --> 01:07:46.519
About everything.

01:07:46.554 --> 01:07:48.454
[knocking]

01:08:00.401 --> 01:08:01.134
Hi.

01:08:01.169 --> 01:08:02.669
Hi.

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:06.506
Thank you.

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:12.512
Thank you.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:13.312
Thank you.

01:08:13.348 --> 01:08:14.447
I'm serious.

01:08:14.482 --> 01:08:17.817
This is the first hot dog
I've had since med school.

01:08:17.853 --> 01:08:19.886
You really ate them every night?

01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:21.020
Maybe every other night.

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:22.055
I mean, I was so busy, I just
thought what can I grab

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:24.323
in ten seconds or less?

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:26.325
You've always been
a hard worker.

01:08:26.361 --> 01:08:27.993
Sometimes too hard.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.196
Maddie Strong.

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:31.865
What on earth are you
doing here?

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:34.533
And with Nate Barzonni?

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:35.635
You didn't know we were coming?

01:08:35.671 --> 01:08:36.502
Of course I did.

01:08:36.537 --> 01:08:39.005
I talk to her every day.

01:08:39.041 --> 01:08:39.973
Where's Luke?

01:08:40.008 --> 01:08:41.741
Hey.

01:08:41.777 --> 01:08:44.410
Sorry, I just got off work.

01:08:44.444 --> 01:08:46.345
Can we talk?

01:08:46.381 --> 01:08:47.981
Excuse me.

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:50.850
Ok.

01:08:50.886 --> 01:08:51.685
So what do you wanna do?

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.886
Do you wanna do
chocolate bananas

01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:54.754
or you wanna keep it savory?

01:08:54.790 --> 01:08:56.389
Uh... follow me.

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:57.957
Ok.

01:08:59.394 --> 01:09:02.595
Look, I know you're frustrated
with me and I get it.

01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:06.499
But my parents have been
together for over 36 years.

01:09:06.533 --> 01:09:08.068
What does that have to do
with us?

01:09:08.103 --> 01:09:10.103
I've always wanted
what they had.

01:09:10.138 --> 01:09:14.107
But they had a really
long engagement.

01:09:14.142 --> 01:09:17.276
So maybe subconsciously
I wanted the same thing.

01:09:17.312 --> 01:09:19.377
I don't know.

01:09:19.413 --> 01:09:22.247
But it doesn't matter now.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:23.316
Why?

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:27.020
Because I've already found
what they have in you.

01:09:27.055 --> 01:09:30.122
So if we get married tomorrow or
next summer it doesn't matter.

01:09:30.158 --> 01:09:32.091
We'll figure it out.

01:09:42.437 --> 01:09:43.603
Now, call me crazy,

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:46.538
but I've never actually had a
persimmon cupcake before.

01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:48.073
But I'd be willing to try,

01:09:48.109 --> 01:09:50.109
as long as you don't run away
from me this time.

01:09:50.145 --> 01:09:52.245
I haven't been running away.

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:54.814
Ok, maybe a little.

01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:58.051
But at least I remembered you.

01:09:58.086 --> 01:10:01.121
The Wildcats?

01:10:01.156 --> 01:10:03.056
Wait, did we go to
high school together?

01:10:03.091 --> 01:10:05.591
Still not ringing a bell.

01:10:13.434 --> 01:10:15.168
Their truffles were good but
it's hard when your cupcakes

01:10:15.203 --> 01:10:16.435
are so much better.

01:10:16.471 --> 01:10:18.138
You're just saying that.

01:10:18.173 --> 01:10:19.172
Can I say I'm a fan?

01:10:19.207 --> 01:10:21.841
[laughs]

01:10:21.877 --> 01:10:23.409
Is this for us?

01:10:23.444 --> 01:10:25.411
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

01:10:25.446 --> 01:10:28.248
I just didn't realize we were
gonna eat so much en route.

01:10:28.283 --> 01:10:29.649
Here.

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:31.317
Sit.

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:33.386
Thank you.

01:10:38.026 --> 01:10:42.295
I guess I just wanna say
thank you to you, too.

01:10:42.330 --> 01:10:46.766
These last few weeks have
been everything to me.

01:10:46.802 --> 01:10:50.270
And I'm gonna do everything
I can to keep that going.

01:10:53.641 --> 01:10:55.341
Um...

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:58.178
But...

01:10:58.213 --> 01:10:59.879
Something came up this morning.

01:10:59.915 --> 01:11:01.514
I thought you went to talk
to Dr. Caldwell.

01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:03.850
I did.

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:05.118
And I know this may
not sound great,

01:11:05.153 --> 01:11:08.788
but you remember that research
program I was telling you about?

01:11:08.824 --> 01:11:12.192
The huge grant that they're
applying for just went through.

01:11:12.227 --> 01:11:13.827
Ok.

01:11:13.862 --> 01:11:17.864
And Dr. Langston wants me
to be a part of his team.

01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:19.632
But it means I would have
to leave.

01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:21.100
Monday.

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:25.038
Leave?

01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:27.640
To go where?

01:11:27.675 --> 01:11:29.175
Boston.

01:11:29.211 --> 01:11:31.211
Are you serious?

01:11:34.115 --> 01:11:37.416
So you- you go in to talk
about staying here

01:11:37.452 --> 01:11:40.854
and you come out leaving?
On Monday?

01:11:40.889 --> 01:11:42.521
I didn't say yes.

01:11:42.557 --> 01:11:46.192
But you're going to,
aren't you?

01:11:48.296 --> 01:11:51.831
I don't know.

01:11:51.867 --> 01:11:54.700
I feel so stupid.

01:11:54.736 --> 01:11:56.169
I should have known
this would happen.

01:11:56.204 --> 01:11:59.239
What're you talking about?

01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:02.942
The minute I let you in again
you find a reason to leave.

01:12:02.978 --> 01:12:04.277
That is not true.

01:12:04.312 --> 01:12:07.080
Oh yeah?

01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:12.051
Then why are we in the same spot
we were 10 years ago?

01:12:12.087 --> 01:12:13.386
I need to go.

01:12:13.421 --> 01:12:14.787
I wasn't looking for this,
Maddie.

01:12:14.822 --> 01:12:16.055
I wasn't looking to leave.

01:12:16.091 --> 01:12:18.258
You never are.

01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:21.861
I don't know what to do.

01:12:21.897 --> 01:12:23.897
This is an opportunity
of a lifetime.

01:12:27.302 --> 01:12:29.168
And I'm not?

01:12:31.106 --> 01:12:32.939
I love you, Maddie.

01:12:36.111 --> 01:12:39.879
And I love you, too.

01:12:39.915 --> 01:12:44.050
That's why I want you to do
what you were meant to do.

01:12:51.293 --> 01:12:53.726
And I'll do the same. Here.

01:13:15.383 --> 01:13:21.254
<i>â™ª Well, I've loved you more</i>
<i>than I've ever known â™ª</i>

01:13:21.289 --> 01:13:27.793
<i>â™ª But all I ask of you is</i>
<i>that we could grow old â™ª</i>

01:13:27.829 --> 01:13:31.831
<i>â™ª There's something</i>
<i>in the way you say â™ª</i>

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:35.268
<i>â™ª I love you â™ª</i>

01:13:35.303 --> 01:13:40.506
<i>â™ª There's something in the way</i>
<i>we never say goodbye â™ª</i>

01:13:42.243 --> 01:13:44.510
Alright, I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:47.280
The air is not gonna be half as
clear where you're going.

01:13:47.315 --> 01:13:49.349
You know what?
You're probably right.

01:13:49.384 --> 01:13:50.450
You sure you have to go?

01:13:50.485 --> 01:13:52.718
It appears so.

01:13:52.753 --> 01:13:55.355
Well, it's been a pleasure,
Dr. Barzonni.

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:56.889
Even if you're bailing
on us early.

01:13:56.924 --> 01:13:58.958
You need to start calling
me Nate.

01:13:58.994 --> 01:14:01.060
Ok, Nate.

01:14:01.096 --> 01:14:04.497
Well, you know where to find us
if you ever wanna come back.

01:14:09.871 --> 01:14:12.338
One more thing.

01:14:12.374 --> 01:14:14.073
I know you're shy.

01:14:14.109 --> 01:14:15.908
You should just ask her
out already.

01:14:15.943 --> 01:14:17.977
Who, Chloe?

01:14:18.013 --> 01:14:21.714
You don't wanna miss
something great.

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:23.182
Dr. Barzonni?

01:14:23.218 --> 01:14:24.517
Someone left this here for you.

01:14:24.552 --> 01:14:25.351
Oh, when?

01:14:25.387 --> 01:14:27.853
This morning.

01:14:48.771 --> 01:14:51.105
You did such a good job,
this looks amazing.

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:51.638
It's so good.

01:14:51.674 --> 01:14:52.206
It turned out great.

01:14:52.241 --> 01:14:53.473
It did, it really did.

01:14:53.509 --> 01:14:54.541
Wow.

01:14:55.678 --> 01:14:58.312
I still can't believe you warmed
up to a winter wedding.

01:14:58.347 --> 01:15:00.681
I'll admit, it's not exactly
what I pictured

01:15:00.717 --> 01:15:03.084
but it does feel pretty perfect.

01:15:03.119 --> 01:15:04.318
Even with snow.

01:15:04.353 --> 01:15:06.286
Hey, do you think you could
spare six hazelnut caps to go?

01:15:06.322 --> 01:15:08.255
Well, our re-opening isn't
until tomorrow

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:10.524
so I think you can have
as many as you like.

01:15:10.559 --> 01:15:13.027
I think we'll stick to six.

01:15:13.062 --> 01:15:15.362
Hey, for the record,
they're not all for me.

01:15:15.397 --> 01:15:16.363
Oh, no?

01:15:16.398 --> 01:15:18.465
What can I say,
wedding planning is stressful.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.334
They really help.

01:15:25.474 --> 01:15:27.441
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:15:27.476 --> 01:15:28.709
So am I.

01:15:28.745 --> 01:15:29.676
Hey, Chloe?

01:15:29.712 --> 01:15:30.745
Hmm?

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:32.880
Can you put six hazelnut
cappuccinos to go, please?

01:15:32.915 --> 01:15:34.548
Yes.

01:15:34.583 --> 01:15:35.616
Thank you.

01:15:38.554 --> 01:15:40.221
I've always prided myself
on overtime.

01:15:40.256 --> 01:15:43.124
If you keep up these hours
you might just lap me.

01:15:43.159 --> 01:15:44.992
It's just an old habit, I guess.

01:15:45.027 --> 01:15:46.493
So are you settling in nicely?

01:15:46.528 --> 01:15:48.229
I'm adjusting.

01:15:48.264 --> 01:15:48.896
But do you like it here?

01:15:48.931 --> 01:15:51.331
It's a very different thing.

01:15:51.367 --> 01:15:52.399
I'm sure I will.

01:15:52.434 --> 01:15:53.901
Eventually.

01:15:53.936 --> 01:15:55.970
Well, with all the work we have
on our plate

01:15:56.005 --> 01:15:58.739
I'm sure you won't even notice
one way or the other.

01:15:58.775 --> 01:16:01.108
Yeah, that's the problem.

01:16:06.515 --> 01:16:08.149
Are you ok?

01:16:09.752 --> 01:16:11.685
I'm not sure that I am.

01:16:28.137 --> 01:16:29.804
Here we go.

01:16:35.278 --> 01:16:38.913
[laughter]

01:16:38.948 --> 01:16:40.114
Oh, the place looks great.

01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:42.416
It's almost time to officially
re-open.

01:16:42.451 --> 01:16:44.885
Well, let's get
this party started.

01:16:46.956 --> 01:16:50.424
I can't believe you turned me
into a cake person.

01:16:50.459 --> 01:16:51.859
This looks great.

01:16:51.894 --> 01:16:54.728
Well, it's all because of you.

01:16:54.763 --> 01:16:57.097
Money is not what made
this place great.

01:16:57.133 --> 01:16:58.765
You and I both know that.

01:16:58.801 --> 01:16:59.800
Congratulations.

01:16:59.836 --> 01:17:00.534
Thank you.

01:17:00.569 --> 01:17:01.568
Excuse me.

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:05.672
Yeah, of course.

01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:07.107
Did you try one?

01:17:07.143 --> 01:17:08.075
They're delicious.

01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:09.810
Um, excuse me.

01:17:09.846 --> 01:17:10.945
I gotta go soon.

01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:11.979
You bet.

01:17:16.452 --> 01:17:17.918
I am very pleased.

01:17:23.726 --> 01:17:25.926
You're right.

01:17:25.962 --> 01:17:28.595
I didn't remember you
from high school.

01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:30.264
Oh.

01:17:30.299 --> 01:17:31.332
Ok.

01:17:31.367 --> 01:17:32.833
But I have not been able to stop
thinking about you

01:17:32.869 --> 01:17:34.701
since the day that
I walked in here.

01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:39.473
I just didn't know how
to say that.

01:17:39.508 --> 01:17:41.708
Until now.

01:17:41.744 --> 01:17:49.016
So I was wondering if maybe
you'd wanna start over again?

01:17:49.051 --> 01:17:52.353
From, like... now?

01:17:56.058 --> 01:17:57.457
Hi.

01:17:57.493 --> 01:17:58.926
I'm Chloe.

01:18:00.763 --> 01:18:01.795
I'm Charlie.

01:18:06.202 --> 01:18:08.102
[ding]

01:18:18.781 --> 01:18:21.515
You look beautiful.

01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:24.684
The place looks amazing.

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:27.421
I- I can't do this again.

01:18:27.456 --> 01:18:29.390
Me neither.

01:18:29.425 --> 01:18:31.691
That's why I'm here.

01:18:31.727 --> 01:18:33.527
I told you I won't do
long distance.

01:18:33.562 --> 01:18:34.561
I know.

01:18:34.596 --> 01:18:36.563
That's why I'm here.

01:18:36.598 --> 01:18:39.433
For good.

01:18:39.468 --> 01:18:40.700
What're you talking about?

01:18:40.736 --> 01:18:43.670
I know I said that it was
a dream job.

01:18:43.705 --> 01:18:46.073
I was wrong.

01:18:46.108 --> 01:18:47.441
It doesn't mean anything
if the life that I want

01:18:47.476 --> 01:18:49.343
is here with you.

01:18:49.378 --> 01:18:50.744
But you just started.

01:18:50.779 --> 01:18:53.447
They have plenty of amazing
replacements.

01:18:53.482 --> 01:18:58.618
And my lectures went over
really well here, so...

01:18:58.654 --> 01:19:03.890
So they offered you a job?

01:19:03.926 --> 01:19:06.060
And I accepted.

01:19:06.095 --> 01:19:07.127
See?

01:19:07.163 --> 01:19:09.696
I told you you wouldn't get rid
of me that easily.

01:19:09.731 --> 01:19:11.098
This.

01:19:11.133 --> 01:19:12.766
This is everything that I want.

01:19:12.801 --> 01:19:16.971
And if you'll have me I promise
I'll spend the rest of my life

01:19:17.006 --> 01:19:19.873
making sure you feel that.

01:19:22.244 --> 01:19:25.745
It was always you, Maddie.

01:19:30.286 --> 01:19:33.053
What're you doing?

01:19:33.089 --> 01:19:36.556
I think you may have
misplaced this.

01:19:36.825 --> 01:19:38.092
Just think.

01:19:38.127 --> 01:19:42.496
I can be your tech support.

01:19:42.531 --> 01:19:43.397
I do need that.

01:19:43.432 --> 01:19:44.764
Your sous chef?

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.633
Only in a pinch.

01:19:51.807 --> 01:19:54.741
So what do you say?

01:19:54.776 --> 01:19:56.443
Can we do this?

01:19:56.479 --> 01:19:59.980
All in?

01:20:00.016 --> 01:20:01.415
Yes.

01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:03.450
Yes. It's always been yes.
