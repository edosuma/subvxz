♪ ♪

00:19.687 --> 00:22.104
Aw. Hey there, big guy.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.647
How you feeling
this morning, huh?

00:23.774 --> 00:26.191
-Uh, good.
-Okay. Just checking.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.277
-You're a tough little cookie.
-Thanks, linda.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.779
Are you guys, uh, talking
about dad's hemorrhoid?

00:30.865 --> 00:31.822
Oh, you mean gary?

00:31.949 --> 00:33.073
You named my hemorrhoid?

00:33.159 --> 00:34.867
Yeah. Gary.
He lives in your butt.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.869
Well, uh, gary has moved out.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.996
-It's just my butt now.
-Brian?

00:39.081 --> 00:40.706
Wait, my butt's name is brian?

00:40.791 --> 00:41.790
Big ol' brian.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.292
Well, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

00:43.419 --> 00:44.543
So much better. Yep.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.211
'cause what the doctor
was gonna do to you

00:46.338 --> 00:47.671
Sounded like a horror movie.

00:47.757 --> 00:49.089
W-we don't
have to talk about it.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.382
Seems like we do.

00:50.426 --> 00:51.842
The doctor said
if your dad's hemorrhoid

00:51.969 --> 00:52.968
Didn't get smaller,

00:53.054 --> 00:53.969
They'd have to put a needle

00:54.055 --> 00:55.012
Up his butt and drain it.

00:55.097 --> 00:55.971
-Agh!
-Ew!
-Nope.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.222
They were about to do it.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.849
But then I started
to get nauseous

00:58.976 --> 01:00.434
And I was dry heaving.

01:00.519 --> 01:03.062
In-in a brave way. So, he said
we could wait a few days

01:03.105 --> 01:05.481
-And see if it got
better on its own.
-And it did.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.776
Yup. It's totally better.
All gone. On its own.

01:08.819 --> 01:11.195
-Never will have to do
that needle thing.
-Butt needle.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.781
-Gene.
-Why isn't gretchen
calling me back?

01:13.866 --> 01:14.865
[scoffs] I know why.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.075
'cause I melted her lookbook

01:16.202 --> 01:17.576
At the salon
and she's really upset.

01:17.661 --> 01:20.245
I'm still a little confused
how you melted something

01:20.331 --> 01:23.248
-While getting a haircut.
-Ah, I was in the chair,

01:23.334 --> 01:24.625
Looking at gretchen's lookbook.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.251
She has old magazine cutouts

01:26.337 --> 01:27.836
Of every hairstyle
she's ever done.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.880
She puts inspirational
stuff in there, too.

01:30.049 --> 01:32.257
Some cute dogs, jason priestley.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.134
Anyway, gretchen
had to step away

01:34.261 --> 01:35.552
And she put down
her curling iron.

01:35.638 --> 01:38.338
So I then decided
I wanted to read a magazine,

01:38.432 --> 01:40.974
So I put down the lookbook
on top of the curling iron,

01:41.102 --> 01:42.267
Which I did not see.

01:42.353 --> 01:44.103
Apparently, you're not
supposed to do that.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.063
-Because of fire?
-Yes, tina.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.773
It melted in the middle
and got sort of

01:47.900 --> 01:49.024
Roasted around the edges.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.902
-Like a cubano.
-Anyway, I feel horrible.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.779
I-I'm just gonna call her again.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.072
Damn it. Voice mail.

01:55.157 --> 01:56.281
Hey, gretchen.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.449
Oh, my god, I bet you look

01:57.535 --> 01:59.368
So pretty today,
I can't stand it.

01:59.453 --> 02:02.246
That's a weird-looking squirrel.
Wait, never mind.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.331
That's just a wet sock
laying in the road.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.749
-It makes you think.
-Well, well, well.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.292
What do we have here?

02:07.419 --> 02:09.753
Free stuff?
<i> Veterinarian,</i> the board game.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.131
"feel the high-paced intensity
of a veterinarian's office

02:12.216 --> 02:13.632
From the comfort
of your living room."

02:13.759 --> 02:16.218
Damn. Who's excited
to play this after school?

02:16.303 --> 02:17.886
I mean, the television
still works, right?

02:17.972 --> 02:20.472
Look, you get to operate
on dogs, birds, cats.

02:20.599 --> 02:22.891
There's a spinner thing.
That's fun. Right?

02:22.977 --> 02:24.852
Oh, you guys kept walking.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.311
Gretchen!

02:26.438 --> 02:27.771
-Hi, linda.
-Hi!

02:27.857 --> 02:31.024
You're not here to beat
me up, right? [weak chuckle]

02:31.110 --> 02:32.776
No, I just got my nails done.

02:32.862 --> 02:36.530
Okay, well, how about
a free burger? On the house.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.447
Sure. I could eat.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.283
Wait. On the house? Seriously?

02:39.368 --> 02:41.577
One burger of the day
for gretchen, bobby.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.203
-Okay.
-Hi, bob. How are you?

02:43.330 --> 02:44.621
-You look good.
-Hi, gretchen.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.415
-His hemorrhoid went away.
-Thanks, lin.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.750
-They were gonna have
to use a butt needle.
-Lin.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.794
Yup, yup, it--
but it's fine now.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.213
It's all good.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.549
-Bye.
-So, I figured out
how you can pay me back.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.093
-Yeah?
-You're friends with
a limo driver, right?

02:58.179 --> 03:00.179
-Yeah.
-Well, you know how I'm planning

03:00.297 --> 03:02.806
My baby sister jestain's
bachelorette party?

03:02.933 --> 03:04.057
Yeah.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.350
And everything
was gonna be great.

03:05.436 --> 03:06.643
We were gonna eat
at the oyster palace.

03:06.729 --> 03:09.104
-Ooh, yum.
-Yeah, she likes
the seafood tower.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.190
It's like they put
the whole ocean on that thing.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.941
And after dinner,
we're going to pickles

03:12.985 --> 03:14.610
To see a different kind
of seafood tower,

03:14.695 --> 03:17.613
-If you know what I mean!
-I think I do. Should I say?

03:17.698 --> 03:20.032
-Teddy, no.
-And we were gonna
drive around all night

03:20.201 --> 03:22.868
In a limo, which apparently
you have to book in advance,

03:22.953 --> 03:24.286
Which I did not do.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.954
So I was wondering if your
friend could help me out,

03:26.040 --> 03:29.208
And I'll forget all about you
burning my lookbook

03:29.293 --> 03:31.168
That I worked on for 15 years!

03:31.295 --> 03:34.004
Okay, okay, yes!
I'll call her, I'll call her!

03:34.089 --> 03:35.964
Oh, frick, linda,
I'm out of town.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.800
-No.
-Yeah, I'm staying
with my friend axel

03:38.886 --> 03:40.886
In cedarburg, wisconsin
for the week.

03:40.971 --> 03:41.970
He bought a bunch of goats.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.055
His neighbors are mad at him

03:43.182 --> 03:44.306
And honestly, I don't blame 'em.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.016
He doesn't have a fence. Wait!

03:46.101 --> 03:48.227
-What?
-Use my limo. Ow. Ow.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.354
You just have to find
a driver you can trust

03:50.481 --> 03:52.439
Who's comfortable handling
a large, elegant vehicle

03:52.524 --> 03:54.316
That's also
a rolling work of art.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.652
-Do you know someone like that?
-I mean, I...

03:56.779 --> 03:58.779
-Wha-what about me?
-Done.

03:58.822 --> 03:59.947
You're a limo driver now.

04:00.032 --> 04:01.490
-Seriously?
-Of course.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.368
You just have to pay for gas
and clean up any pukes or poops.

04:04.495 --> 04:07.079
-Or puke-poops,
which is a thing.
-Thank you so much, nat.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.413
I'll take good care of her.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.874
Yes. Now I don't have
to burn something you love.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.001
This is gonna be
the best bachelorette party.

04:13.087 --> 04:15.337
I'm the best big sister ever!

04:15.464 --> 04:17.297
This bachelorette party's
gonna suck.

04:17.424 --> 04:20.300
I screwed up. None of
jestain's friends can come!

04:20.427 --> 04:22.386
Okay, slow down,
tell me what happened.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.012
I forgot to send
the email invite

04:24.098 --> 04:25.222
And now all her friends

04:25.307 --> 04:26.807
Are doing other things
tomorrow night.

04:26.934 --> 04:27.891
-All of 'em?
-Yeah.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.434
One of 'em's an er doctor.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.437
Another one's visiting her mom
in florida. I mean, come on.

04:32.564 --> 04:35.649
And another one "already
has plans" because the person

04:35.734 --> 04:38.318
"let them know more
than a day before the event."

04:38.404 --> 04:41.405
So now we have an empty limo.
Except for me, jestain

04:41.490 --> 04:43.699
And ms. Baker,
our third-grade teacher.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.409
-Your third-grade teacher?
-I was desperate.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.577
Third-grade teachers
can be friends, linda.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.830
Should we just do it
on a different night?

04:49.915 --> 04:51.498
No, it has to be tomorrow.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.167
Jestain asked her boss
for the night off weeks ago.

04:54.253 --> 04:56.211
That wing you do
doesn't just let waitresses

04:56.297 --> 04:58.588
Take off whatever night
they want. [sighs]

04:58.674 --> 05:00.590
That limo's gonna feel so empty.

05:00.676 --> 05:03.635
Well, uh, I could go, maybe,

05:03.762 --> 05:04.970
-As a guest?
-Huh?

05:05.055 --> 05:07.097
I mean, I know jestain, sort of.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.932
I met her that time
at the salon,

05:08.976 --> 05:10.309
When she brought you wings.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.311
And then you ate the wings
while you did my hair.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.146
-Okay.
-And my sister gayle

05:14.231 --> 05:16.148
Could come, maybe?
She's sort of fun

05:16.233 --> 05:17.649
For people to be around.

05:17.735 --> 05:20.444
-Yeah.
-Then it'll be you, me
and our little sisters

05:20.529 --> 05:22.029
Hanging out and shouting...
[whoops]

05:22.197 --> 05:23.488
-And ms. Baker, too.
-Yeah.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.449
Maybe that could work
and not be too weird.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.784
Now we just need to find
a new limo driver.

05:27.870 --> 05:28.785
Ooh, what about bob?

05:28.912 --> 05:30.829
Wait, you want me
to drive the limo?

05:30.914 --> 05:33.081
Bobby, please.
I need this night to go well

05:33.208 --> 05:34.291
So gretchen will forgive me.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.909
And driving
is just like sitting.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.503
So, really, you'll just
be sitting all night.

05:38.589 --> 05:39.671
Mm-hmm. I love sitting.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.381
Well, maybe you want
to sit down here

05:41.467 --> 05:43.800
And play a little board game
that's fun for the whole family?

05:43.927 --> 05:45.218
-Nope.
-No thanks.
-Sorry, tina.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.928
Not feeling it right now.
Okay, I get it.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.013
So bob can do it.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.389
-Bob's gonna drive.
<i> -Great.</i>

05:49.475 --> 05:51.266
<i> Hey, this is</i>
<i> gonna be okay, right?</i>

05:51.393 --> 05:53.143
Of course.
We're gonna give jestain

05:53.312 --> 05:55.145
The bachelorette party
of her dreams,

05:55.314 --> 05:58.398
With people she kind of knows.
All right!

06:02.446 --> 06:03.570
-[tina whistles]
-thank you.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.906
Doesn't your father look
like a real limo driver?

06:06.075 --> 06:07.074
What can't this guy do?

06:07.201 --> 06:08.158
-Touch his toes.
-[bob] mm.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.534
-Touch his knees?
-Okay.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.370
-Brush his teeth?
-W-we don't have to play
this game.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.413
Wait, where's jen?
She should be here by now.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.248
That's the first
rule of babysitting.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.167
-You got to be at the place.
-I'm gonna call her.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.960
Hi, jen.
It's linda belcher.

06:19.088 --> 06:22.047
-Hi, linda. It's jen.
-Are you on your way?

06:22.132 --> 06:23.548
-In life?
-To our house?

06:23.634 --> 06:25.884
I'm not babysitting
till next weekend,

06:25.969 --> 06:29.346
So if I left now I'm worried
I'd get there too early.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.139
Next weekend?
No, tonight.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.725
Oh, it, um,
can't be tonight because

06:33.811 --> 06:37.437
I wrote down "linda belcher
babysit next weekend."

06:37.523 --> 06:39.689
Tonight I wrote down
"teach night school."

06:39.817 --> 06:42.567
Class, go ahead and take out
your graphing calculators.

06:42.653 --> 06:45.237
I should probably
get off the phone. Bye.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.406
Okay, tina,
you're in charge tonight.

06:47.491 --> 06:48.573
In charge, huh?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.742
So they have to do or play
whatever I say?

06:50.828 --> 06:51.785
No, mom, please.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.537
She's gonna
make us neuter animals.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.248
Sorry, she's the oldest, she's
in charge and we got to go.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.166
Don't neuter anything
I wouldn't neuter

06:58.293 --> 06:59.626
And stay out of my room.

06:59.795 --> 07:03.463
Uh-oh.
Just going over a speed bump.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.257
Front wheels...

07:05.384 --> 07:07.426
And back wheels.

07:07.511 --> 07:08.927
Oh, yeah, we did it.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.595
He's very bad at driving.

07:10.681 --> 07:11.805
Gayle, what are you wearing?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.098
Is that your
renaissance faire outfit?

07:13.183 --> 07:15.142
Yeah. I also sleep
in it sometimes.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.518
-[phone vibrates]
-ooh. Hey, gretchen.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.103
[gretchen]
<i> I just thought of something.</i>

07:18.272 --> 07:20.147
<i>Bob can't be bob, your husband.</i>

07:20.232 --> 07:21.356
<i> It kind of ruins the magic.</i>

07:21.483 --> 07:23.400
<i> -Can he be someone else?</i>
-Um, yep.

07:23.485 --> 07:24.484
Bob, you got that?

07:24.570 --> 07:26.194
-What am I doing?
<i> -I got to go. Bye.</i>

07:26.280 --> 07:27.195
Pretend you're
not my husband and just

07:27.281 --> 07:28.697
-Be the limo driver.
-Okay.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.824
-And maybe you should
come up with a fake name.
-Really?

07:30.993 --> 07:32.742
-You should probably
have an accent.
-Wait, what?

07:32.870 --> 07:35.328
-I-I don't want to do an accent.
-I think you got to do it.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.622
-Mm.
-Oh, bob, pretend
you're an ex-con

07:37.708 --> 07:39.332
Putting your life back together.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.293
And you didn't mean
to hurt all those people

07:41.420 --> 07:43.003
But their ghosts
come to see you at night

07:43.046 --> 07:45.505
And give you little riddles
to solve about their lives.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.925
-Do I say all of that, or...
-No, that's just your vibe.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.179
Oh, my god,
look at this freaking limo!

07:52.347 --> 07:53.680
[bad italian accent]
hello. Ciao.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.475
I-I'm your
limousine driver, dob.

07:56.602 --> 08:00.103
Dob the driver.
Uh, and, uh, I am not married.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.231
-I'm single.
-Not me. I'm getting married.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.400
Hello, dob. It's nice
to have never met you.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.486
[jestain]
<i> glad you could make it, linda.</i>

08:07.613 --> 08:08.862
And gayle, right?

08:08.947 --> 08:10.155
This is ms. Baker.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.656
I haven't seen her
since third grade.

08:11.742 --> 08:14.284
I brought stickers.
Jestain always liked stickers.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.411
-Gretchen liked fighting.
-Well, now look at her.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.413
Or look at me,
'cause she did my hair.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.249
-She's a genius with hair.
-Like that einstein guy.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.709
-Have you seen the hair on him?
-[whoops]

08:22.836 --> 08:26.421
I can't believe we're
going to pickles after dinner!

08:26.507 --> 08:29.007
Gretch, remember
the last time we were there?

08:29.092 --> 08:30.967
-Of course I do.
-The tea party.

08:31.053 --> 08:32.886
-The tea party!
-Tea party?

08:32.971 --> 08:35.013
Is that, like, a sex thing
I don't know about?

08:35.098 --> 08:36.932
No, the three dancers
were on stage

08:37.059 --> 08:39.017
Having an actual tea party.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.769
Not just any dancers, either.

08:40.896 --> 08:44.898
The best dancers at pickles.
Throb, rocket and steve. Ah.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.441
Yeah, sitting in little chairs.

08:46.568 --> 08:50.070
Little saucers,
tea cups, tiny sandwiches.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.488
And then the music kicked in.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.949
<i> And when those men</i>
<i> formed a pyramid</i>

08:54.034 --> 08:55.742
<i> And the guy on top</i>
<i> sprayed tea everywhere</i>

08:55.827 --> 08:58.662
<i> Like he was the damn fountain</i>
<i> at the bellagio...</i>

08:58.747 --> 09:02.082
<i> In that moment,</i>
<i> everything in the world felt</i>

09:02.167 --> 09:04.251
-Beautiful.
-Oh, my god.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.545
And I got to be there
with my big sister.

09:06.630 --> 09:09.297
If we see that performance
tonight-- wow.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.549
Oh, you're seeing it.

09:10.634 --> 09:13.093
Don't you worry.
Look how many singles I brought.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.553
$40 worth of singles.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.513
-[whoops]
-oh, I dropped one.

09:16.598 --> 09:17.514
Oh, I-I dropped some more.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.766
I love my big sister!

09:19.851 --> 09:21.768
Oh, red light.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.478
Hi. How's your sandwich?

09:23.522 --> 09:25.355
[tina]
<i> now, look, I know you guys</i>

09:25.482 --> 09:27.399
Are a little on the fence
about playing this game.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.483
On the fence?

09:28.569 --> 09:29.859
But I'm in charge,
so we're doing it.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.194
So, it says the player who

09:31.280 --> 09:33.113
Has saved the most animals wins.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.447
You spin
the little spinner thing

09:34.533 --> 09:36.658
And move your game piece.
Gene, you go first.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.368
[gene] four.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.620
Ooh, exciting.
Procedure card.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.999
-See what it says.
-"express poodle's anal glands.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.960
Collect $150."
yeah!

09:47.045 --> 09:49.004
Way to go, gene.
My turn.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.422
Six. Big number. Heh.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.341
"fake credentials,
license suspended"?

09:53.427 --> 09:55.844
"lose two turns, pay $200"?
What?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.346
But, uh, having fun.
[short chuckle]

09:58.432 --> 10:00.015
All right, louise, your turn.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.018
-Okay.
-Hope you get a six.
Kidding. [short chuckle]

10:03.145 --> 10:06.146
[bad italian accent] oh,
we're going to drive by pickles

10:06.273 --> 10:07.480
On our way to dinner.

10:07.566 --> 10:10.317
Maybe if we look real hard
we'll see some abs.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.736
Yeah.
A little abs-petizer.

10:12.863 --> 10:13.778
-[whoops]
-what the...

10:13.947 --> 10:15.405
Uh-oh.
Linda. Linda.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.240
-What?
-Pickles is being fumigated.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.158
What?

10:18.243 --> 10:19.868
-Look.
-Oh, no. Oh, my god.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.578
Um, uh, you know what,
don't drive this way.

10:21.663 --> 10:22.829
-Turn, turn, turn.
-What?

10:22.956 --> 10:23.913
-Turn.
-Oh, my god.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.915
Uh, hang on, everyone.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.250
-[gretchen]<i> whoa!</i>
-[jestain]<i> easy there!</i>

10:27.336 --> 10:29.336
Sorry.
That, uh, street was, uh...

10:29.463 --> 10:30.920
Uh, no good.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.130
What a mysterious man.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.716
I wonder what demons
he's running from.

10:35.344 --> 10:37.594
Welcome to
the oyster palace, ladies.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.347
Um... [short chuckle] gretchen,
hang back here for a second.

10:40.432 --> 10:41.723
Everyone else go in.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.684
Everything's fine. Ooh,
oh, I can smell the oysters.

10:44.770 --> 10:47.312
-What is it? What's going on?
-Pickles is closed.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.439
-They're fumigating.
-What? No, no, no, no, no!

10:49.566 --> 10:52.317
That's why I turned like that.
I-I'm a good driver.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.361
Didn't you call
and make a reservation?

10:54.446 --> 10:56.404
Who makes a reservation
at a strip club?

10:56.490 --> 10:58.907
"hey, hi, can you reserve
some naked men for us?"

10:58.992 --> 11:00.575
I just figured
you'd called or something.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.743
What are we gonna do?

11:01.828 --> 11:03.787
Well, is there another
strip club nearby?

11:03.914 --> 11:06.706
There was dingles in bog harbor,
but it shut down last year.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.124
And, of course,
todd's tush tavern

11:08.210 --> 11:09.459
Closed a while back.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.628
So, pickles is really
the only option.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.296
Oh!
I keep screwing this up.

11:13.382 --> 11:14.464
What? No.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.466
You heard how much pickles
meant to her.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.927
Can we at least
wait till after dinner

11:19.054 --> 11:20.345
To tell her we're not going?

11:20.472 --> 11:22.347
No. You're not
telling her anything.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.766
You asked for my help
and I'm gonna help you.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.893
I don't just burn
precious lookbooks,

11:27.062 --> 11:28.520
I also put out fires.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.480
-[gasps] I just got chills.
-Yep, yep.

11:30.565 --> 11:33.316
Wait, jen!
Jen's cousin works at pickles.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.776
-Hot cousin dave?
-Yes.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.278
Maybe we can call jen
and get his number.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.780
And then maybe
he can get us the numbers

11:38.865 --> 11:40.782
-Of those guys.
-Throb, rocket and steve?

11:40.867 --> 11:42.951
-Yeah.
-Wait, and then what?

11:43.078 --> 11:44.327
There's no pickles right now.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.746
Well, uh, maybe we all
go to a different place.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.374
-Like, maybe they'll come
to gretchen's place?
-Damn it.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.710
My landlady said no more parties
since the one where

11:51.753 --> 11:55.004
I kind of peed off my balcony
onto her balcony.

11:55.132 --> 11:56.297
What is a balcony for, then?

11:56.466 --> 11:58.133
What are you
using your balcony for?!

11:58.260 --> 12:00.844
I mean, there is a place
we could use. Bob?

12:00.971 --> 12:03.263
-Oh, no.
-Come on, we're desperate here.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.056
I don't know
if that's even legal.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.767
-We'll cover up the windows.
-But we serve food there.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.894
What if penis sweat
gets everywhere?

12:10.021 --> 12:12.689
I mean, it won't get everywhere.
Do it for gretchen.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.441
Yeah, do it for me.
And jestain.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.652
-Oh, my god.
My sweet little jestain.
-Oh, fine.

12:17.779 --> 12:18.945
-All right!
-Yeah, yeah!

12:19.030 --> 12:20.113
Pickles at the restaurant.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.698
Oh, my god, thank you.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.658
We should get inside
and eat oysters. For jestain.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.745
Right. Uh, bobby, can you call
jen and all the other people?

12:26.830 --> 12:30.248
-[sighs] accent or no accent?
-Uh, feel your way through it.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.459
Have fun. Thank you,
love you, bye. Oysters!

12:36.548 --> 12:38.631
Okay, 50 bucks
for giving a parakeet cpr.

12:38.717 --> 12:39.716
Pretty good deal.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.593
Yeah, I'm rolling
in veterinarian dough.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.888
Lopping off dog testicles
is easy money, baby.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.181
All right, tina, it's your turn.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.725
Break a leg.
Not a dog's leg. Again.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.352
-That was sad.
-Here I go. [groans]

12:51.438 --> 12:53.938
Three. Mm-hmm.
"a cat was hit by a car.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.149
"spin an even number
for a blood transfusion

12:56.234 --> 12:57.859
Or lose the patient
and your next turn"?

12:57.944 --> 13:00.028
-You got to be kidding me.
-You got this, t.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.988
-Do it for kitty.
-Five. Damn it.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.698
Ooh. Sorry, kitty.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.909
She can be friends
with the other ones you lost.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.076
-In pet heaven.
-[groans]

13:07.162 --> 13:09.037
Tina, it doesn't seem like

13:09.164 --> 13:10.246
You're really enjoying this.

13:10.332 --> 13:11.706
We don't have to keep playing.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.875
Uh, what are you talking about?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.210
I-I love this game.

13:15.337 --> 13:16.961
I don't even care at all
how bad I'm doing.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.881
[whispers] I heard she
went to the worst vet school.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.257
[indistinct conversations]

13:21.343 --> 13:23.251
Do you think
bob can pull this off?

13:23.345 --> 13:25.345
Oh, yeah. Bob is great
at talking on the phone.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.347
Unless it's to my mother.
Or-or people.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.849
But maybe he's great
at talking to male strippers?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.309
Ah, I'm so nervous.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.937
I-I'm gonna drink some more
of my scotch on the beach.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.230
Excuse me, waiter.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.065
Can I take these shells
home with me?

13:37.192 --> 13:38.316
Uh, those are yours
to keep, ma'am.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.860
Yes! Anyone else
keeping your shells?

13:40.946 --> 13:42.946
-Can I have your shells?
-What, you want my shrimp tails?

13:43.031 --> 13:43.988
Yeah.
Give 'em to me.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.114
Should we get another round?

13:45.200 --> 13:46.658
-You want another round?
-Ms. Baker.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.076
-Look at you.
-What?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.118
It's not a school night.

13:49.204 --> 13:50.537
Who wants stickers?

13:50.622 --> 13:53.039
-I'll take one.
-Ooh, everybody gets stickers.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.290
I'm so full of seafood

13:54.376 --> 13:57.252
But I'm saving room for pickles!

13:57.337 --> 13:59.337
-Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.
-Yeah. [weak chuckle] pickles.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.297
I'm putting my sticker
on my face.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.300
Hot cousin dave.
It-it's bob belcher.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.094
Your cousin jen babysits for us.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.554
I mean, our-our kids.

14:07.639 --> 14:08.847
We're-we're grownups.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.181
Quick, uh,
work question for you.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.016
Um, do you happen to have throb,

14:12.102 --> 14:14.018
Rocket and steve's
phone numbers?

14:14.104 --> 14:15.562
Which throb?
There's more than one?

14:15.730 --> 14:19.190
Hi, uh, is this, um, throb?
Oh, sorry. Terry.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.526
Your real name isn't throb.
I-I-- of course.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.070
Well, uh, hot dave
gave me your number.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.155
You guys don't call him that?

14:26.283 --> 14:27.782
I-I think he's pretty hot.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.159
Uh, I'm wondering
if you're busy-- oh...

14:30.245 --> 14:32.036
You're at a nursing home?
Stripping?

14:32.122 --> 14:33.454
Right, not stripping.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.123
You're w-w--
you're with your father.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.041
That's-that's nice.
Is he mobile?

14:37.127 --> 14:38.877
You're making pizza.
That's, uh,

14:38.962 --> 14:40.295
That's great, uh, rocket.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.423
Uh, well, tell your son
happy birthday

14:43.550 --> 14:44.340
From-from me.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.967
Hey, steve, uh, my name is bob.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.094
I-I got your number
from hot dave,

14:48.221 --> 14:49.762
Who I guess isn't considered

14:49.890 --> 14:51.222
Hot in your community,
but anyway,

14:51.308 --> 14:53.600
Uh, this is, uh,
kind of a hail mary,

14:53.727 --> 14:55.643
But, uh, here-here it is.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.437
♪<i> we're getting in the limo</i> ♪

14:57.480 --> 14:59.606
♪<i> we're getting</i>
<i> in the limo!</i> ♪

14:59.774 --> 15:01.441
Whoa.
Ms. Baker loosened up.

15:01.559 --> 15:03.067
Lot of mai tais.
So many.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.569
Well? Are they coming?
I'm freaking out.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.905
-I don't know.
-What do you mean
you don't know?

15:06.990 --> 15:08.406
Well, throb is with his dad

15:08.491 --> 15:10.783
And it's rocket's son's
birthday. They're having pizza.

15:10.869 --> 15:12.535
But I left a voice mail
for steve.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.495
Uh, a good voice mail?
I think?

15:14.581 --> 15:15.997
I mean, you know, for me?

15:16.082 --> 15:17.248
So we don't know if he's coming?

15:17.334 --> 15:19.459
What do we do?
We get bob to strip?

15:19.544 --> 15:21.210
Bob, what are you
comfortable showing us?

15:21.338 --> 15:23.171
I-I don't think
that's a good plan.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.797
I think we just
take her to the restaurant

15:24.925 --> 15:25.882
And hope steve shows up.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.342
Oh! We're screwed.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.344
Well, who knows?
Maybe she's all full of shrimp

15:29.387 --> 15:31.930
And oysters and shots
that gretchen made up

15:32.057 --> 15:33.514
That used vodka and tartar sauce

15:33.600 --> 15:35.767
In a way that seemed to make
the bartenders uncomfortable

15:35.894 --> 15:37.727
And now she's sitting down
in the cozy limo

15:37.812 --> 15:40.396
And she won't be that excited
for strippers anymore?

15:40.523 --> 15:42.515
Strippers! Strippers!

15:42.567 --> 15:44.275
Strippers!
Strippers!

15:48.156 --> 15:49.614
[bob] [bad italian accent]
well, we are here, ladies.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.908
At the restar--
I-I m-- I mean, uh, pickles.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.993
The private pickles place.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.286
Yup, private pickles.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.580
It's better than regular
old public pickles

15:57.666 --> 15:59.415
Because here you get the dancers

15:59.501 --> 16:02.335
Or maybe<i> a</i> dancer
all to ourselves.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.920
I-it's, like, a premium package.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.880
Yeah, yeah.
Um, uh, dob,

16:05.966 --> 16:07.382
Any word on your, uh,

16:07.467 --> 16:09.050
Limo driver phone
about anything?

16:09.177 --> 16:10.176
[whispers] nothing.

16:10.261 --> 16:11.803
Wait, isn't this
your restauran--

16:11.930 --> 16:13.179
-Hey.
-[whispers] you haven't
been here before.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.722
-You don't know where you are.
-Ow! Oh!

16:14.766 --> 16:16.224
-Ow!
-Looks like a burger place.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.518
That's why it's such
a good private club.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.769
Let's go in.
[whoops]

16:19.854 --> 16:21.437
[tina]
<i> spin an odd number</i>

16:21.564 --> 16:23.272
Or the bunny will
have to be euthanized.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.440
Oh, I don't know
if I can take this.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.317
Tina, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

16:26.486 --> 16:28.611
But it's pretty late.
We should probably go to bed?

16:28.738 --> 16:30.989
No. We started this
and we have to finish it.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.699
Kids?
What are you still doing up?

16:32.784 --> 16:35.576
I'm just, um, getting sheets
for the restaurant.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.036
Is the restaurant cold?

16:37.163 --> 16:38.204
Um, here's the thing.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.789
Sometimes mommies and daddies

16:39.874 --> 16:40.915
Are doing a bachelorette party

16:41.001 --> 16:42.291
And the strip club is closed

16:42.377 --> 16:43.960
And you have to have
the strippers come to you.

16:44.045 --> 16:45.086
We know all that.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.380
Meaning, come to the restaurant?

16:47.540 --> 16:48.881
Uh, yes. W-we hope.

16:48.967 --> 16:49.882
We haven't heard back.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.009
Are you sure we shouldn't, um,

16:51.094 --> 16:52.343
Come down there and help out?

16:52.470 --> 16:53.928
Serve waters,
choreograph numbers?

16:54.055 --> 16:56.597
Sorry. Kids at a bachelorette
party kind of kills the vibe.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.890
No offense.
Now go to bed.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.058
And stay out of my room.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.685
Okay.
Yeah, we'll just go to bed

17:00.812 --> 17:02.311
While pickles
is going on downstairs.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.564
That's what I say every night.
Talking about my hm-hm.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.150
Okay, I have a proposal
as your babysitter.

17:07.235 --> 17:08.776
We stop playing the game,
get the ladder,

17:08.862 --> 17:10.236
Go into the attic,
drop down into the crawlspace

17:10.363 --> 17:11.654
And watch the stripper party

17:11.740 --> 17:12.739
Through the vent
in the restaurant.

17:12.824 --> 17:13.948
Whoa.
Uh, okay.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.450
I like sneaking into places.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.535
-Let's do that.
-But good game, everybody.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.579
Who knows who would have won.
[short chuckle] neck and neck.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.247
[short chuckle] but I feel bad
about that cat's neck.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.124
Great, let's go see
some grownups

17:23.209 --> 17:25.752
Acting like maniacs
around ding-a-lings.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.212
Good wine at this place, huh?

17:28.339 --> 17:29.547
Tastes like
it was opened this week.

17:29.632 --> 17:32.759
Oh, he's not coming.
This is a disaster.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.594
[sighs]
I'm so sorry, gretchen.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.804
Uh, do you want me to strip?

17:36.973 --> 17:39.057
I mean, I would,
I-if we could, you know,

17:39.142 --> 17:40.308
Make it a lot darker in here,

17:40.435 --> 17:42.101
Like, pretty much
completely dark?

17:42.187 --> 17:45.146
No, let's just call it.
But thanks.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.148
I'm just gonna tell her.
[groans]

17:47.275 --> 17:49.275
Jestain,
I screwed up everything.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.694
-No strippers are coming!
-Huh? W-what do you mean?

17:51.821 --> 17:54.155
I forgot to invite all your
friends until it was too late

17:54.240 --> 17:56.324
And that's why
they're all busy tonight.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.410
And I forgot to get a limo
and dob is actually bob.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.579
He's a burger cook
and this is his restaurant.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.998
-Hi. Hello.
-And I never called pickles,

18:04.167 --> 18:05.583
So I didn't know
that they were closed.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.335
I just messed up everything.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.421
I'm the worst person
you could have asked to do this.

18:10.548 --> 18:11.547
-Oh.
-Boo!

18:11.633 --> 18:14.759
I'm sorry.
I wanted this to be great.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.928
I wanted to do this for you
'cause you

18:17.055 --> 18:18.846
Look up to me so much.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.223
[louise] [whispering]
there's more crying at this

18:20.308 --> 18:21.516
Strip club than I expected.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.935
Huh. It was a lot of work
to get down here

18:24.062 --> 18:25.103
And I'm not sure how we get out.

18:25.188 --> 18:26.687
It's fine. Never mind.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.731
I'm sorry, jestain.
I'm a terrible big sister.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.858
-Gretchen--
-I ruined your party.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.152
-You're not terrible.
-You don't get it, linda.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.987
You're always
the perfect older sister.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.197
-Mm...
-I mean, I'm not.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.241
-Definitely not.
-Okay, gayle.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.326
She makes a lot of mistakes.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.995
You know, one time she tried
to sleep with my husband.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.455
No, gayle.
That was you.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.707
-My husband. And you. Bob.
-That's true.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.334
Well, that's not
how I remember it.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.169
I'm just saying,
big sisters are allowed

18:50.296 --> 18:52.547
To make mistakes, too.
We're not perfect.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.132
Otherwise, how do little sisters

18:54.217 --> 18:55.675
Know it's okay
not to be perfect?

18:55.844 --> 18:57.593
[whispering] oh,<i> that's</i> what
you've been doing for me.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.220
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

18:59.347 --> 19:03.099
Gretch, I know tonight
didn't go exactly as planned.

19:03.184 --> 19:04.600
Like, none of my friends
could come.

19:04.727 --> 19:07.311
Though ms. Baker
is making her way up there!

19:07.397 --> 19:08.312
That's right.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.481
But you're
the coolest person I know.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.316
You're, like,
the one I want to be with

19:12.402 --> 19:14.443
On my bachelorette party night.

19:14.571 --> 19:18.406
-I freakin' love you.
-I freakin' love you, too!

19:19.284 --> 19:20.908
-I still have a hemorrhoid.
-What?

19:20.994 --> 19:22.243
It-it's not better.
It hurts.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.744
I'm in a lot of pain right now.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.288
I-I lied.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.498
I knew it. That man has
been clenched for three days.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.584
I was so scared
at the doctor, lin.

19:29.711 --> 19:32.503
When he was about to
put the needle in my butt,

19:32.547 --> 19:34.755
I just wanted you to be there
to hold my hand.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.091
But I was too embarrassed
to ask you

19:37.218 --> 19:38.384
To come to the butt doctor
with me.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.845
Oh, my god, of course
I'd hold your hand.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.555
I don't want you to be scared.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.265
You're my big, strong boy.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.975
Thanks, lin.
Uh, sorry.

19:46.060 --> 19:48.477
It seemed like we were
all confessing things.

19:48.646 --> 19:49.896
Are we in the right place?

19:49.939 --> 19:51.355
-Steve?
-You came!

19:51.482 --> 19:52.273
Oh. Hi, steve.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.524
Well, it was hard to say no

19:53.651 --> 19:54.609
To that voice mail.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.943
That guy sounded so desperate.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.528
Hey.
Uh, that-that was me.

19:57.614 --> 19:58.905
I-I... I get that a lot.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.323
I brought my friend smooth.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.991
I'm sorry we can't
do the tea party routine,

20:02.076 --> 20:04.535
But smooth and I can
do the double dutch routine.

20:04.579 --> 20:06.078
I don't know
if you've seen that one.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.330
Oh, tea party.

20:07.415 --> 20:08.915
Sorry, we need a third person

20:09.083 --> 20:10.249
For the high tea finale.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.501
-We form kind of a pyramid.
-Oh, I know.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.295
The double dutch
is still pretty good.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.923
I mean, it's no tea party,
but what is?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.091
-I'll be your third!
-[gasps]

20:19.177 --> 20:20.760
-Oh, wow.
-Damn.
-Seriously?

20:20.887 --> 20:22.303
-Um...
-I know every move.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.472
And I'm strong.
I'll be the base.

20:24.632 --> 20:25.806
Right on.
I'll be the top.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.350
Can we borrow
some cups and saucers?

20:27.477 --> 20:28.476
-Uh...
-Sure.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.436
-Smooth?
-Let's serve some tea.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.979
-Okay, all right, here we go.
-[cheering]

20:32.065 --> 20:33.814
This makes me want
tiny sandwiches.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.107
Wait, where are they going?

20:35.235 --> 20:36.692
No, no, no. Are they climbing
onto the counter?

20:36.778 --> 20:38.903
We can only see their feet.
I don't want to just see feet.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.530
Watching you right now
is my favorite part so far.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.115
You look like a dog
that got locked out of

A tennis ball store.
