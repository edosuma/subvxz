WEBVTT

00:03.873 --> 00:05.396
Hayley.
Hayley, wake up.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.007
It's a horrible
family emergency!

00:07.050 --> 00:08.530
What?!
God what?!

00:08.573 --> 00:11.011
The emergency is your life
isn't going anywhere,

00:11.054 --> 00:12.403
so we're going to
get you some drive.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.188
We're going for a drive?

00:14.231 --> 00:15.319
In a car?

00:15.363 --> 00:17.321
No,
we're going for a walk.

00:17.365 --> 00:20.020
In our bodies.

00:20.063 --> 00:22.022
As you know, every day
I leap out of bed

00:22.065 --> 00:23.675
and fly into my slippers.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.242
Of course,
your "leap of faith."

00:25.286 --> 00:27.157
It shakes the whole house.

00:27.201 --> 00:30.334
But what you don't know is
every morning before my leap,

00:30.378 --> 00:33.076
I take a brisk walk around
Langley's historic

00:33.120 --> 00:35.209
Gaslamp District
to get the blood up

00:35.252 --> 00:36.862
and the laziness down.

00:36.906 --> 00:39.082
You go on this walk
and then get back in bed?

00:39.126 --> 00:41.215
This healthy routine
gives me the drive

00:41.258 --> 00:43.173
I need to have
a successful career.

00:43.217 --> 00:44.696
I want that for you, too.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.569
But I already have
a successful career at SubHub.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.875
They even trust me enough
to let me have a key.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.051
A key to where?

00:51.094 --> 00:52.704
The bathroom.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.358
Just as I feared.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.099
The room so awful
it's where we hide

00:56.143 --> 00:57.535
our disgusting toilets.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.624
Hayley,
SubHub is not a career.

00:59.668 --> 01:02.627
It's a dead-end.
But I'm showing you a way out,

01:02.671 --> 01:04.281
complete with breakfast
at a little place

01:04.325 --> 01:05.543
I like to call...

01:05.587 --> 01:07.241
Johnny Fifties!

01:08.590 --> 01:10.374
I remember this place!

01:10.418 --> 01:11.767
We used to come here
all the time.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.073
Johnny, my man!

01:13.116 --> 01:14.291
Gimme a piece of toast,

01:14.335 --> 01:16.206
and mash up
these peas for me.

01:16.250 --> 01:19.209
But only if you promise
not to charge me for the peas.

01:19.253 --> 01:20.602
They're my property, Johnny.

01:20.645 --> 01:24.388
I won't pay for what's
already mine, Johnny.

01:24.432 --> 01:27.217
Again, Stan,
my name is Sal.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.914
The restaurant
is Johnny Fif--

01:28.958 --> 01:30.133
Ooh, I'll have
a shortstack of pan--

01:30.177 --> 01:31.787
No, the food is terrible.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.746
You just come to soak up
that authentic 1990s-style

01:34.790 --> 01:36.400
'50s atmosphere.

01:36.444 --> 01:39.229
Stan, I've got some bad news.
We're closing.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.144
Closing?!
How could this be?!

01:41.188 --> 01:45.105
Well, people just don't care
about 1950s nostalgia anymore.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.977
Or maybe we'd have survived if,
I dunno, every day

01:48.020 --> 01:50.022
you bought something
more expensive than toast.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.589
Johnny, 86 the toast.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.025
You can't expect
people to eat

01:53.069 --> 01:54.984
after getting terrible
news like that!

01:57.160 --> 01:58.857
No! No!
Stop the music!

01:58.901 --> 02:00.946
Not today,
big brass band!

02:00.990 --> 02:02.252
Shut up!
Shut up!

02:02.296 --> 02:04.428
You okay up there,
Mr. Smith?

02:04.472 --> 02:06.430
Johnny Fifties
is going under.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.954
It's bad news,
or to put it in terms

02:08.998 --> 02:11.131
you'll understand,
bad music.

02:11.174 --> 02:13.045
Well,
if you love the place so much,

02:13.089 --> 02:14.656
maybe you could
give them a loan?

02:14.699 --> 02:16.962
I just don't know where
I'd find the money.

02:17.006 --> 02:19.051
Anyway, you and the boys
take the rest of the week off,

02:19.095 --> 02:21.271
fully paid of course.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.882
Well it's official, gang.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.971
I have Hep C.

02:26.015 --> 02:28.452
I think it's time for some
major lifestyle changes --

02:28.496 --> 02:30.193
Red alert!
Family emergency!

02:30.237 --> 02:31.673
What?!
God what?!

02:31.716 --> 02:33.979
I'm too upset to say
what the emergency is.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.851
I must carve it.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.899
J...

02:40.943 --> 02:42.901
O...

02:42.945 --> 02:45.295
Oh, it's about Johnny Fifties closing.

02:45.339 --> 02:46.992
I heard him tell
the Bandleader.

02:47.036 --> 02:49.517
Oh, yeah,
Johnny Fifties!

02:49.560 --> 02:51.345
Their food sucks.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.216
And no Shock Top.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.913
Okay, my fingers hurt.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.524
It's Johnny Fifties.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.482
I cannot let
this restaurant close.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.092
- Why?
- Well, for one thing,

03:00.136 --> 03:01.659
it's part
of my morning routine.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.183
But also, let's be honest.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.185
I'm a '50s kind of guy.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.838
Exhibit A -- My suit.

03:06.882 --> 03:10.494
Oh, yeah,
your suit is sort of '50s.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.844
For a '50s guy like me,
letting Johnny Fifties

03:12.888 --> 03:15.412
close would be like admitting
the '50s were over.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.849
But the '50s are over!

03:17.893 --> 03:20.374
Don't you get it?!
If you're truly nostalgic,

03:20.417 --> 03:22.027
nothing is ever over!

03:22.071 --> 03:23.899
As someone who was alive
back then

03:23.942 --> 03:27.119
with a Wolfman Jack-type
radio DJ persona

03:27.163 --> 03:30.253
and a number-one doo wop hit,
I think Stan's onto something.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.863
Look around this house, guys.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.213
Not a lot of love
for the '50s.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.040
He's right.
No Jell-O molds.

03:35.084 --> 03:36.520
No hula hoops!

03:36.564 --> 03:40.611
Plus, you're not watching
TV while you eat!

03:40.655 --> 03:43.440
And even if you were, <i>
Happy Days</i> is never on!

03:43.484 --> 03:45.137
Uhp, there it is,
but it's a bad one,

03:45.181 --> 03:46.443
doesn't count --
too much Potsie.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.097
That's it!
If I'm going to

03:48.140 --> 03:49.272
save the restaurant --

03:49.316 --> 03:50.708
You have to improve
the food?

03:50.752 --> 03:53.407
I need to get people to love
the '50s again!

03:53.450 --> 03:55.931
There's no time to lose!

03:55.974 --> 03:59.282
Did you know glory holes were
much, much larger in the '50s?

03:59.326 --> 04:01.284
One time me and both
Everly Brothers

04:01.328 --> 04:02.546
stuck our junk
in one together

04:02.590 --> 04:03.982
all at the same time.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.288
And you know who was
on the other side?

04:05.332 --> 04:06.898
The Big Bopper.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.596
At least that's what it felt
like, I never saw him.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.513
What? Never seen
a successful person before?

04:13.949 --> 04:15.559
Is this supposed to be
like Dad's

04:15.603 --> 04:17.169
"leap of faith"
out of bed?

04:17.213 --> 04:19.563
It's a natural expression
of drive.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.478
The Regional Manager's
coming to SubHub today

04:21.522 --> 04:23.959
and I am gonna show him,
and Dad,

04:24.002 --> 04:26.004
that I've got
what it takes to get ahead.

04:27.658 --> 04:30.400
Mr. S throws our food
on the ground

04:30.444 --> 04:32.402
and she jumps
all over the table?

04:32.446 --> 04:34.752
Someone's gotta say it.

04:34.796 --> 04:37.799
They made a mockery
of breakfast.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.717
As your regional manager,
I'm here

04:42.760 --> 04:45.633
because by now, most of you
have seen the leaked documents

04:45.676 --> 04:47.765
referring to your positions
as "dead-end jobs."

04:47.809 --> 04:49.289
Uh, what documents?

04:49.332 --> 04:50.855
It doesn't matter.

04:50.899 --> 04:54.294
The point here is
your jobs are not dead-ends.

04:54.337 --> 04:55.425
Yes,
dead-ender in the back.

04:55.469 --> 04:56.948
So are we allowed to drink

04:56.992 --> 04:58.298
the Oranginas or what?

04:58.341 --> 04:59.777
Give me a promotion!

04:59.821 --> 05:01.344
I've got the keys
to success!

05:01.388 --> 05:04.216
Or should I say
the bathroom?

05:04.260 --> 05:07.307
Pee pee? Poo pee?
What's your pleasure?

05:07.350 --> 05:08.960
Tell me what you need,
what SubHub needs,

05:09.004 --> 05:10.484
and I am on it.

05:10.527 --> 05:13.138
Well, we would like
to open a new location

05:13.182 --> 05:15.227
in the hugely-desirable-
nearly-impossible-to-find-

05:15.271 --> 05:17.360
an-open-space-in
Gaslamp District.

05:17.404 --> 05:20.363
I know just the place.

05:21.669 --> 05:25.150
Johnny Fifties is closing
and SubHub can take its place!

05:25.194 --> 05:26.630
Great idea!

05:26.674 --> 05:27.805
You're promoted!

05:27.849 --> 05:29.633
The rest of you --
demoted!

05:29.677 --> 05:32.462
You live here now
and get paid in pepperoni.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.029
According to math,

05:34.072 --> 05:36.510
Johnny Fifties can stay afloat
for eight weeks.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.163
And we're gonna need
every minute of it

05:38.207 --> 05:40.165
to get people
to love the '50s again.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.993
'Cause you really have to
love the '50s

05:42.037 --> 05:44.822
to stomach your signature
nauseating burgers.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.171
I mean you no disrespect, Johnny.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.651
My name is Sal.

05:47.695 --> 05:50.567
I call it
"Operation '50s Heat Up:

05:50.611 --> 05:54.049
Get 'Em Interested In The '50s
And Save Johnny Fifties!"

05:54.092 --> 05:57.400
What if we call it
"Operation '50s Fever?"

05:57.444 --> 06:00.403
Horrible idea.
Klaus, you're going to Milwaukee

06:00.447 --> 06:02.274
to get the statue
of Arthur Fonzarelli,

06:02.318 --> 06:04.233
aka The Bronze Fonz.

06:04.276 --> 06:05.495
I need it! Go now!

06:08.890 --> 06:10.500
I don't really need
the Fonz statue.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.936
We just can't have
Klaus around

06:11.980 --> 06:13.503
sloshing his bowl water
all over

06:13.547 --> 06:15.070
everyone's classic cars.

06:15.113 --> 06:17.377
Everyone will have
classic cars?

06:17.420 --> 06:19.074
And more!
Here's some concept art

06:19.117 --> 06:21.119
I had made to inspire us.

06:21.163 --> 06:24.732
Cruisin' cars, lawn darts,
asbestos chunks,

06:24.775 --> 06:28.388
Johnny Fifties bursting with
hungry Fonzie impersonators.

06:28.431 --> 06:31.739
Stan, you seem to be leaning
pretty heavily on Fonzie.

06:31.782 --> 06:34.916
Um, people also like,
I don't know, Elvis?

06:34.959 --> 06:37.527
Oh, you mean Singing Fonzie.
Good idea!

06:37.571 --> 06:39.703
I always wanted to be
like Marilyn Monroe

06:39.747 --> 06:41.923
and have an air vent
blow my dress up!

06:41.966 --> 06:43.925
You'll do it!
And Roger, you do your old

06:43.968 --> 06:45.883
Wolfman Jack DJ persona.

06:45.927 --> 06:48.320
That persona
was unforgettable.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.453
What was his name again?
Wolfman Puck?

06:50.497 --> 06:51.715
No, that's not it.
Don't worry,

06:51.759 --> 06:52.977
it'll come
to me on the air.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.457
Jeff, you're a beatnik,

06:54.501 --> 06:57.417
and Steve, you can be a nerd
or "square."

06:57.460 --> 07:00.115
Easy.
True to the time period,

07:00.158 --> 07:02.770
I'll put tape on my glasses
to make them appear broken --

07:02.813 --> 07:04.467
No need!

07:04.511 --> 07:06.774
Just like James Dean,
I pulled my punch

07:06.817 --> 07:08.166
so I only hurt
the glasses.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.429
No you didn't!

07:09.472 --> 07:11.822
Hayley,
you can be Spudnik.

07:11.866 --> 07:14.085
He was a very famous potato.

07:14.129 --> 07:17.611
Dad, you won't believe this.
Your walk gave me drive.

07:17.654 --> 07:21.484
And that drive got me a job
as manager of a new SubHub

07:21.528 --> 07:23.573
opening where Johnny Fifties
used to be!

07:23.617 --> 07:26.315
But Johnny Fifties is where
Johnny Fifties used to be.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.273
Not for long.
After I told them

07:28.317 --> 07:31.276
it was closing,
SubHub sweet-talked the landlord

07:31.320 --> 07:33.670
into taking over
the lease in two days!

07:33.714 --> 07:36.456
But two days isn't nearly
enough time for my plan!

07:36.499 --> 07:37.935
Aren't you happy for me?

07:37.979 --> 07:39.937
Happy?
You betrayed me.

07:39.981 --> 07:42.287
You're trying to destroy
a place I love.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.767
So, you don't like it
when I don't have drive,

07:43.811 --> 07:45.943
and you don't like
when I do have drive.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.292
What even is this?

07:47.336 --> 07:49.599
"Operation '50s Fever"?

07:49.643 --> 07:51.296
My original idea.
Klaus was never here.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.516
Blueprints for
a leather jacket?

07:53.560 --> 07:56.345
A list of places
for Beaver to leave it?

07:56.388 --> 07:59.479
This plan is so stupid.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.785
Thank God I commissioned
concept art

08:01.829 --> 08:04.135
for every possible betrayal.

08:04.179 --> 08:07.312
This is exactly how I feel,
right down to my giant ass!

08:07.356 --> 08:08.836
I can't let her
do this to me.

08:08.879 --> 08:10.185
New plan!

08:10.228 --> 08:12.492
Oh, good, that one
was kinda stupid --

08:12.535 --> 08:14.494
The old plan, faster!

08:14.537 --> 08:17.975
We'll do "Operation '50s Fever"
in 48 hours!

08:18.019 --> 08:20.630
Why have I pinned my hopes
on this fool?

08:20.674 --> 08:23.503
Would a fool get concept art
of himself

08:23.546 --> 08:25.896
dressed as a court jester
pleading with the king

08:25.940 --> 08:27.811
not to cut his head off
for not having enough bells

08:27.855 --> 08:29.334
on his jester hat?

08:29.378 --> 08:31.859
I'm a goner!
Welp, lesson learned.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.513
Shoulda had more bells.

08:33.904 --> 08:36.124
Big Daddy Stan
needs Langley to catch

08:36.167 --> 08:38.300
a baaad case of '50s Fever

08:38.343 --> 08:40.041
or else Hayley
will be proven right

08:40.084 --> 08:42.347
that Stan's plan
to save Johnny Fifties

08:42.391 --> 08:45.176
is a stupid, stuuuupid plan.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.091
<i>You heard it from me,</i> <i>
uh...</i>

08:47.135 --> 08:48.440
<i>what's my name again?</i>

08:48.484 --> 08:50.138
<i>The '50s was so long ago.</i>

08:50.181 --> 08:52.793
<i>Wolfboy... George?</i>

08:52.836 --> 08:55.056
<i>Did I mention Hayley thinks</i> <i>
Stan's plan is stupid?</i>

08:56.753 --> 09:00.061
Gah! I feel betrayed
by Hayley all over again!

09:00.104 --> 09:01.802
- And by you!
- Why me?!

09:01.845 --> 09:03.717
Because you're here
talking my ear off

09:03.760 --> 09:05.370
when you should be
buying extra food

09:05.414 --> 09:07.677
for when I ignite
'50s Fever!

09:08.852 --> 09:10.637
But Stan,
I'm bankrupt --

09:10.680 --> 09:12.943
You don't say
you're "bankrupt," Daddy-O.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.510
You say you're
"on the skids."

09:16.643 --> 09:18.427
I like your plan.

09:18.470 --> 09:21.169
And I love not
wearing seatbelts.

09:21.212 --> 09:22.257
Aah!

09:22.300 --> 09:24.302
The CIA's Cuban Operations

09:24.346 --> 09:26.914
really came through with these
classic cars on short notice.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.742
Paging Mr. Bega,

09:28.785 --> 09:31.571
can you say
"Mambo Number '50s"?

09:34.399 --> 09:35.879
Plenty more where
that came from.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.402
Like a greaser,
I've got goodies

09:37.446 --> 09:39.143
rolled up all over my body.

09:39.187 --> 09:40.362
Pack of raisins.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.451
Box of Goobers
in my waistband.

09:45.672 --> 09:46.934
Aah!

09:48.805 --> 09:50.328
Where are
all the contestants?!

09:50.372 --> 09:52.504
You had one simple job, Steve.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.855
To gather 500 to 600 professional

09:54.898 --> 09:57.205
Fonzie impersonators
on an hour's notice.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.207
How was I supposed
to get the word out?

09:59.250 --> 10:00.774
You won't let me use
my computer!

10:00.817 --> 10:02.384
Before there was e-mail,

10:02.427 --> 10:04.778
there was just plain
tell-e-grams.

10:04.821 --> 10:08.042
And we attached them to the
infamously dangerous lawn darts.

10:08.085 --> 10:11.480
Infamously
dangerously fun.

10:12.829 --> 10:15.092
Have faith, son.
Trends always start with

10:15.136 --> 10:17.791
one single brave
cool guy.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.010
But this time it's not
James Dean.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.838
It's James Me--

10:24.145 --> 10:25.799
Enough of these faulty
toothpicks!

10:25.842 --> 10:29.629
It's time to show Hayley
just how wrong she is.

10:29.672 --> 10:30.673
Okay, one more try.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.593
Oh, Marilyn!

10:37.637 --> 10:39.900
Time to walk
over that normal vent!

10:40.944 --> 10:43.164
I'm in a hurry!
Outta my way!

10:43.207 --> 10:45.949
Whoa, the air's so hot!

10:45.993 --> 10:47.037
My genitals!

10:47.081 --> 10:48.865
Aaaaaaagh!

10:53.000 --> 10:54.218
Hey, let's play chicken!

10:55.698 --> 10:57.395
Whoa!

10:57.439 --> 10:59.833
Someone shred that guy
and slather him

10:59.876 --> 11:01.225
in hot mayonnaise
and marshmallows,

11:01.269 --> 11:02.792
because he's a chicken,

11:02.836 --> 11:04.968
and that's my recipe
for Chicken Ambrosia.

11:08.842 --> 11:11.932
Here's one that never fails
to spark '50s Fever --

11:11.975 --> 11:14.412
passing a milkshake
between cars.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.327
I can't reach you!

11:16.371 --> 11:18.112
I like bongos!

11:20.505 --> 11:21.724
Too thick!

11:21.768 --> 11:23.595
The way it used to be!

11:23.639 --> 11:24.771
Aah!

11:28.035 --> 11:31.342
Ribs broken by
steering column...

11:31.386 --> 11:33.388
the way it used to be.

11:35.390 --> 11:36.696
Yes!

11:36.739 --> 11:39.089
Yay!

11:39.133 --> 11:41.222
With '50s Fever
failing to catch,

11:41.265 --> 11:44.051
it looks like SubHub's
new location is all

11:44.094 --> 11:46.836
but a certainty,
which means...

11:46.880 --> 11:48.446
I'm really
gonna be a manager!

11:48.490 --> 11:50.405
With a manager's salary.

11:50.448 --> 11:53.190
And a manager's mansion.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.324
Who is this
concept artist everyone's using?

11:56.367 --> 11:59.631
None of this would be possible
without you.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.851
My rod is too hot!

12:01.895 --> 12:03.592
And the Goobers in my pants
melted!

12:05.637 --> 12:07.074
Yeah.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.163
None of this would be possible
without me.

12:09.206 --> 12:11.731
You feel bad for a man
who doesn't want his daughter

12:11.774 --> 12:13.036
to live in a mansion?

12:13.080 --> 12:14.472
The best type of house?!

12:14.516 --> 12:17.345
It's all Hayley's fault!

12:17.388 --> 12:19.651
I should've known
she'd mess up having drive

12:19.695 --> 12:22.785
like she has everything
else in her life.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.482
That's it.

12:24.526 --> 12:27.137
You're live
on the air with...

12:27.181 --> 12:28.356
some kinda wolf...

12:28.399 --> 12:29.879
Dad,
I know you're listening,

12:29.923 --> 12:31.359
and I want you to know

12:31.402 --> 12:33.578
I'm with people who appreciate
my drive

12:33.622 --> 12:35.929
so much
I'm getting a mansion.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.800
<i>Wow. For our listeners</i> <i>
who don't know,</i>

12:37.844 --> 12:40.063
<i>that's the best type of</i> <i>
house.</i>

12:40.107 --> 12:42.805
<i>So just give up now
and stop embarrassing yourself!</i>

12:44.067 --> 12:45.895
Another caller!

12:45.939 --> 12:47.244
This isn't over, Hayley.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.029
The fever is catching.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.726
It's the loser '50s guy!

12:50.770 --> 12:52.815
He's cheating
and using a cellphone!

12:52.859 --> 12:55.209
Loser?
Maybe free asbestos

12:55.252 --> 12:56.514
will change your mind!

12:56.558 --> 12:59.039
The miracle molecule
of the '50s!

12:59.082 --> 13:00.997
Ugh!
- And, uh...

13:01.041 --> 13:03.826
it's only gonna get more
feverish when people see,

13:03.870 --> 13:04.958
uh...

13:06.960 --> 13:08.918
...a James Dean type like me

13:08.962 --> 13:12.313
in a classic teenage knife fight
up at the old observatory!

13:12.356 --> 13:14.750
DJ, play a song
of betrayal.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.753
I wanna dedicate it

Going to Johnny Fifties,
saving it at long last?

15:48.121 --> 15:49.992
<i>Too soon.</i>

15:50.036 --> 15:51.951
<i>These people aren't
hungry enough yet to choke down</i>

15:53.082 --> 15:54.823
<i>Everyone, to the Sock Hop!</i>

15:54.866 --> 15:56.564
<i>It's over, Hayley.</i>

15:56.607 --> 15:58.609
Everyone can't have
'50s Fever.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.916
My god,
it's happening in here!

16:00.960 --> 16:03.963
Wail on that black forest ham,
big daddy!

16:05.138 --> 16:07.140
Welp, we're throwing
in the towel.

16:07.183 --> 16:10.099
SubHub Corporate is as quick to
give up as we are to celebrate.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.971
Why would he do this
to me?

16:12.014 --> 16:14.451
He wanted me
to have drive.

16:14.495 --> 16:15.626
Wait...

16:15.670 --> 16:17.106
drive...

16:17.150 --> 16:20.457
Time to fight '50s
with '50s.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.857
Aah!

16:28.900 --> 16:31.077
Now that you've danced
yourselves ravenous

16:31.120 --> 16:34.297
and would eat trash
like wild boars, let's go...

16:34.341 --> 16:35.820
save Johnny Fift--

16:35.864 --> 16:38.475
I challenge you
to a drag race!

16:39.563 --> 16:41.043
If I win the race,

16:41.087 --> 16:44.133
SubHub takes over
Johnny Fifties.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.787
Ha!
Why would I accept that

16:45.830 --> 16:47.528
when I already have
everything I want?

16:47.571 --> 16:51.358
Because --
'50s Honor demands it.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.319
Okay! Okay!

16:56.363 --> 16:58.321
'50s Honor,
which I've just heard of,

16:58.365 --> 17:00.367
is everything to me!

17:00.410 --> 17:02.543
Let's drag!

17:02.891 --> 17:06.677
Everyone's finally tuning
into me, Dogboy Chuck,

17:06.721 --> 17:09.854
as we all wonder
who will win the big drag race.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.334
<i>It's Stan vs. Hayley,</i>

17:11.378 --> 17:13.423
<i>Johnny Fifties vs. SubHub,</i>

17:13.467 --> 17:14.772
<i>past vs. future,</i>

17:14.816 --> 17:17.645
<i>today's glory holes</i> <i>

17:17.688 --> 17:19.255

<i>where you can just wave</i> <i>

17:21.040 --> 17:22.041
<i>on the other side.</i>

17:25.174 --> 17:27.568
Hayley, before I win,

17:27.611 --> 17:29.570
I should finally be
honest with you.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.746
I wish Fonzie
was my daughter.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.269
You're sick, Dad.

17:33.313 --> 17:36.185
And Fonzie is really more
of a '70s icon!

17:36.229 --> 17:38.100
Fonzie, Chachi, Potsie, Richie,
Fonzie, Chachi, Potsie, Richie!

17:40.276 --> 17:43.062
Don't!
These cars are death traps!

17:43.105 --> 17:44.280
Don't worry, Steve.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.108
I've had my mechanics
working all night.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.849
Show 'em, boys!

17:47.892 --> 17:49.546
Ay!

17:49.590 --> 17:51.679
Safe enough for ya,
Steve?

17:51.722 --> 17:55.465
And I'm DJ Apeman Snack,
the voice of a generation

17:55.509 --> 17:57.250
and the face of a genera--

17:57.293 --> 17:59.469
damn it, you can't see
my face on the radio.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.123
I'll text you all a picture
of my face

18:01.167 --> 18:02.907
using AMBER Alert technology.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.387
<i>Look at it even</i> <i>
if you're driving.</i>

18:06.389 --> 18:08.304
<i>Sorry if my dick is also</i> <i>
in the picture.</i>

18:08.348 --> 18:09.871
<i>Don't let that</i> <i>
shock you off the road.</i>

18:09.914 --> 18:12.482
<i>And take off those seatbelts,</i> <i>
it's the '50s!</i>

18:12.526 --> 18:14.615
<i>Vietnam's around the corner</i> <i>
and it's gonna git ya!</i>

18:18.706 --> 18:21.317
And now the song
you've all been waiting for,

18:21.361 --> 18:24.668
my very own number-one hit
from 1958,

18:24.712 --> 18:26.714
"Drag Race Angels"!

18:26.757 --> 18:30.021

19:10.714 --> 19:13.717
And a lot of the lyrics
make more sense now than ever.

19:13.761 --> 19:16.242
I loved Johnny Fifties
because of the time

19:16.285 --> 19:18.026
I spent there with Hayley.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.897
But I can spend time
with her now!

19:19.941 --> 19:22.378
Must kill Dad!

19:22.422 --> 19:24.467
Eesh.
Or maybe I can't.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.774
Man, how would Fonzie
fix this?

19:28.079 --> 19:29.646
Ay!

19:31.866 --> 19:33.868
Nay!

19:40.788 --> 19:42.833
The Bronze Fonz, Stan!

19:42.877 --> 19:44.531
I took some '50s-style benzos

19:44.574 --> 19:46.924
and drove to Milwaukee
and back in one day!

19:51.277 --> 19:53.496
Johnny Fifties is saved!

20:02.418 --> 20:04.246
Oh, my God!
Dad, are you okay?

20:04.290 --> 20:05.987
Oh, Hayley, forgive me.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.772
I haven't been James Dean
or James Me.

20:08.816 --> 20:11.297
I've been plain old
James Mean.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.516
Dad, you -- you might have
brain damage.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.779
One of your pupils
is so big.

20:15.823 --> 20:18.869
That's because I'm looking
at someone I love so big.

20:18.913 --> 20:21.307
Hayley, I want you to know
I support you

20:21.350 --> 20:23.309
wherever your drive
takes you next,

20:23.352 --> 20:24.962
SubHub or no SubHub.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.575
The toothpicks are back!

20:28.618 --> 20:32.100
I'm gonna drive you
to the hospital.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.276
I spy
with my little eye --

20:34.320 --> 20:35.756
a table!

20:35.799 --> 20:38.628
Aww, it's our table!
