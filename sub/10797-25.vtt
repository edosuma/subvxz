WEBVTT

00:02.118 --> 00:05.705
First Officer's log,
stardate 41986.0.

00:05.872 --> 00:08.208
We await the return of Capt Picard

00:08.374 --> 00:12.003
who was summoned to Starbase 718
for an emergency conference.

00:12.170 --> 00:15.924
Meanwhile, our sensors
are monitoring an ancient capsule

00:16.090 --> 00:18.009
which appears to be from Earth.

00:18.176 --> 00:20.303
I wonder how it got out here.

00:20.470 --> 00:22.180
At present speed and heading,

00:22.346 --> 00:26.018
it will enter the Kazis binary system
and be destroyed.

00:26.184 --> 00:28.853
I could use a tractor beam
to adjust its heading.

00:29.020 --> 00:31.731
I think not. It's just debris.

00:31.898 --> 00:34.442
We only noticed it
because we're waiting here.

00:34.609 --> 00:37.611
Let it be.
Let nature take its course.

00:37.779 --> 00:40.031
How long until Capt Picard returns?

00:40.197 --> 00:42.992
The last communication
indicated several hours.

00:43.159 --> 00:46.162
Request permission
to investigate this vehicle.

00:46.329 --> 00:49.249
- Why? It's a derelict.
- It is a piece of history.

00:49.415 --> 00:53.711
The opportunity to examine an ancient
vehicle does not come often.

00:53.878 --> 00:57.131
And, as you pointed out,
we do have the time.

00:57.298 --> 01:01.177
Very well. Be ready to beam back
before the Captain returns.

01:01.343 --> 01:04.180
- Thank you, sir.
- Lt Worf, go with him.

01:04.346 --> 01:05.723
Aye, sir.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:21.406 --> 01:23.490
Minimal oxygen atmosphere.

01:25.952 --> 01:29.663
An ancient solar generator.
Still operating.

01:34.502 --> 01:36.378
Commander, look at this.

01:38.421 --> 01:41.425
The on-board computers
have ceased functioning.

01:41.591 --> 01:45.679
I may be able to download this
disk drive to the Enterprise.

01:57.149 --> 02:01.069
Must be sealed. Probably with age.

02:03.362 --> 02:05.199
Not necessary.

02:40.191 --> 02:43.444
The seal has been broken
and the environment corrupted.

02:46.197 --> 02:47.407
Here's another.

02:57.083 --> 02:58.668
This one is empty.

03:04.340 --> 03:06.550
Commander! Look at this.

03:38.165 --> 03:41.251
Space, the final frontier.

03:42.961 --> 03:46.882
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:47.048 --> 03:51.136
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

03:52.971 --> 03:56.641
..to seek out new life
and new civilisations,...

03:57.558 --> 04:01.229
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:28.482 --> 05:30.900
Were they frozen
for an extended journey?

05:31.068 --> 05:35.155
If so, there would be evidence
of more sophisticated monitoring.

05:35.322 --> 05:38.909
These containers were designed
solely for refrigeration.

05:39.993 --> 05:43.121
The Captain's shuttle
is approaching the shuttle bay.

05:43.288 --> 05:47.083
This is the Captain. I want to go
when the shuttle is secure.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.169
We'll make all preparations.

05:49.335 --> 05:52.255
Cmdr Data, return to
the Enterprise immediately.

05:52.421 --> 05:54.674
We have an unusual situation, sir.

05:54.841 --> 05:57.719
There are people on board. Frozen.

05:57.885 --> 05:59.304
Frozen? How many?

05:59.470 --> 06:03.266
Three. The vehicle
has suffered severe damage.

06:03.432 --> 06:05.685
Most of her systems have failed.

06:05.851 --> 06:08.312
Should they be transferred
to the Enterprise?

06:08.480 --> 06:11.857
I do not believe
we should leave them here, sir.

06:12.441 --> 06:16.362
With your permission,
we will return with three containers.

06:16.528 --> 06:18.656
Whatever you do, do it quickly.

06:25.412 --> 06:28.791
Mr La Forge,
set course 058, mark 1 73.

06:29.499 --> 06:32.461
Number One, staff meeting
on observation deck.

06:33.171 --> 06:36.799
Captain, those coordinates will
take us into the Neutral Zone.

06:40.761 --> 06:43.722
That is correct, Mr La Forge.
Warp factor eight.

06:44.307 --> 06:46.975
- Aye, sir. Warp eight.
- Engage.

06:52.230 --> 06:57.569
Two Federation outposts
in Sector 30 have been destroyed.

06:59.154 --> 07:03.700
There's been no communication with
Federation starbases in Sector 31

07:03.868 --> 07:09.080
since stardate 41 903.2.

07:10.749 --> 07:13.794
- Romulans.
- That's the assumption.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.380
There's been no contact
with the Romulans

07:16.546 --> 07:18.381
since the Tomed lncident.

07:19.757 --> 07:23.220
The questions are, why now?
What's their objective?

07:23.761 --> 07:26.347
For 50 years, barely a whisper.

07:26.515 --> 07:29.559
Now, for no apparent reason,
they're back with a roar.

07:29.726 --> 07:32.687
All we know of them
is based on rumour or conjecture.

07:34.105 --> 07:38.735
The strategic decision...
is to send one ship.

07:39.318 --> 07:40.570
The Enterprise.

07:40.737 --> 07:43.823
We could find ourselves
greatly overmatched.

07:43.990 --> 07:46.117
True enough. It's a gamble.

07:46.283 --> 07:50.579
This first encounter, coming so
suddenly after all this time,

07:50.747 --> 07:52.539
we assume it's a setup?

07:52.707 --> 07:55.168
If force is necessary,
we will use it.

07:55.334 --> 08:00.214
But our goal is to establish
relations with the Romulans.

08:00.381 --> 08:03.884
If we don't succeed,
then to convince them of our resolve.

08:04.052 --> 08:08.555
The feeling at Starfleet is
that they are seeking confrontation.

08:08.723 --> 08:12.018
They may want to test
themselves in battle

08:12.184 --> 08:14.395
against a Federation starship.

08:14.562 --> 08:18.065
See how we've advanced.
If that is so, I need to know it.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.150
I'll need a full profile.

08:20.318 --> 08:23.695
There is limited information,
but I will prepare something.

08:23.863 --> 08:27.158
Computer, estimated time of arrival
at the Neutral Zone?

08:27.324 --> 08:29.701
19 hours, 28 minutes.

08:29.869 --> 08:33.205
Let's reassemble in six hours.

08:33.371 --> 08:35.874
Stay sharp, no surprises.

08:36.041 --> 08:39.669
I'd rather outthink them
than outfight them. Questions?

08:48.637 --> 08:51.932
- What is it, Doctor?
- The people from the capsule.

08:52.098 --> 08:55.643
- Capsule? What people?
- The people Data beamed over.

08:55.811 --> 08:59.690
- I wasn't aware that he had.
- He did. They were frozen.

08:59.856 --> 09:01.232
I thawed them.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.193
- You what?
- What else could I do?

09:04.361 --> 09:07.781
The crypts in which they
were frozen were falling apart.

09:08.239 --> 09:12.911
- So, what's their condition?
- Right now, they're all sleeping.

09:13.078 --> 09:15.831
Each one needed
minor medical attention.

09:15.997 --> 09:19.334
Minor now, but then their
conditions were terminal.

09:19.501 --> 09:21.169
One had a heart problem.

09:21.336 --> 09:25.132
Another, advanced emphysema,
with extensive liver damage.

09:25.298 --> 09:30.845
Most surprising of all, each
had been frozen after they died.

09:32.097 --> 09:33.389
After they died?

09:33.890 --> 09:37.935
Cryonics. It was a kind of fad
in the late 20th century.

09:38.103 --> 09:40.271
People feared dying.

09:40.855 --> 09:42.190
It terrified them.

09:42.356 --> 09:45.318
So, at the moment of death,
they would be frozen,

09:45.484 --> 09:47.736
so that at some time in the future,

09:47.904 --> 09:51.365
when a cure had been found
for what killed them,

09:51.533 --> 09:55.452
they could be thawed, healed,
and sent about their business.

09:57.537 --> 10:00.666
In the case of this group,
it apparently worked.

10:03.335 --> 10:05.837
Mr Data, report to sickbay.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.547
Immediately.

10:16.723 --> 10:21.853
Look, I am never critical of any
member of my staff being curious.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.773
But it's just that
the timing is so...

10:24.940 --> 10:28.944
I could not leave them.
Their vehicle was deteriorating.

10:29.486 --> 10:31.906
Data, they were already dead.

10:32.072 --> 10:34.533
What more could have happened
to them?

10:35.242 --> 10:39.579
I see your point. At the time,
it seemed the proper thing to do.

10:41.164 --> 10:43.249
Well, they're alive now.

10:44.209 --> 10:47.629
We'll have to treat them
as living human beings.

10:47.795 --> 10:50.382
Alive and well
and ready to be awakened.

10:50.549 --> 10:53.677
Before you wake them
I want Security here.

10:53.844 --> 10:55.762
Lt Worf, report to sickbay.

10:55.929 --> 11:00.016
They're sedated, but they should
be up as soon as possible.

11:01.935 --> 11:05.063
Well,... then,
we have no other choice.

11:05.896 --> 11:08.066
None that I can see.

11:58.073 --> 12:00.284
Welcome to the 24th century.

12:05.873 --> 12:08.959
I retrieved some information
from the ancient disk

12:09.125 --> 12:10.962
I removed from their computer.

12:11.128 --> 12:16.759
Her name is Clare Raymond.
Age, 35. Occupation, homemaker.

12:17.802 --> 12:20.470
Must be some kind
of construction work.

12:20.595 --> 12:24.224
She died of an embolism.
It was probably very sudden.

12:24.391 --> 12:27.644
Otherwise, her physical condition
was excellent.

12:32.983 --> 12:38.864
His name is Ralph Offenhouse.
Age, 55. Occupation, financier.

12:39.072 --> 12:41.532
Advanced cardiomyopathy.

12:41.700 --> 12:45.077
Inoperable at the time,
but easily correctable now.

12:45.245 --> 12:49.082
He must've known his condition
was terminal for some time.

12:50.166 --> 12:53.461
Much of his file,
we could not retrieve.

12:53.628 --> 12:56.422
His name is LQ Sonny Clemonds.

12:56.590 --> 12:59.467
His occupation
had something to do with music.

12:59.633 --> 13:03.262
There was marked deterioration
in every system of his body.

13:03.430 --> 13:06.557
Probably massive chemical abuse.
Unbelievable.

13:06.724 --> 13:08.809
Sounds like someone who hated life.

13:08.977 --> 13:12.647
Yet he had himself frozen
so he could go through it all again.

13:12.813 --> 13:15.608
Too afraid to live,
too scared to die.

13:16.484 --> 13:20.697
Doctor, this situation is
more suited to your talents.

13:20.863 --> 13:22.740
I'll be on the bridge.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.707
Number One.

13:31.749 --> 13:35.794
Take charge of our guests until
we decide what to do with them.

13:35.962 --> 13:36.920
Aye, sir.

13:37.088 --> 13:40.465
Number One,...
keep them out of my way.

13:50.393 --> 13:54.771
I know this is very confusing to you,
so I'll attempt to explain.

13:54.939 --> 13:57.691
You are on the starship
USS Enterprise.

13:57.857 --> 13:58.901
American?

13:59.067 --> 14:03.239
No. The United Federation of Planets.
Earth is a member.

14:04.740 --> 14:06.575
What year is this?

14:06.741 --> 14:09.995
By your calendar, 2364.

14:11.538 --> 14:12.706
What?!

14:15.626 --> 14:17.543
My heart... Is it...?

14:18.128 --> 14:19.546
It's perfectly fine.

14:19.713 --> 14:22.841
In fact, all of you are now
in excellent health.

14:24.301 --> 14:27.221
It worked. I made it.

14:28.888 --> 14:30.389
What is that?

14:32.558 --> 14:33.893
An android.

14:35.646 --> 14:37.063
You mean, a robot?

14:37.231 --> 14:40.901
There is a distinct difference
between an android and a robot.

14:41.359 --> 14:45.447
And him? The one I saw before,
with the... head?

14:45.613 --> 14:46.948
She means Worf.

14:48.617 --> 14:52.162
He's a Klingon.
That takes a little more explanation.

14:52.328 --> 14:56.708
I paid some idiot a lot of money
to freeze me when I died.

14:56.874 --> 15:00.253
I just got to hear the words.
Am I alive?

15:00.419 --> 15:01.879
Yes. Absolutely.

15:02.046 --> 15:05.633
And the liver that was about
to explode in my face?

15:05.800 --> 15:07.969
Perfectly sound.

15:08.135 --> 15:12.181
Excuse me, could someone tell me
what's going on here?

15:12.348 --> 15:17.352
About 370 years ago,
you died of a massive embolism.

15:19.772 --> 15:22.066
I don't remember anything
about that.

15:22.650 --> 15:25.236
You and the others were frozen.

15:26.279 --> 15:30.157
Cryonics, you know?
Freeze you now and heal you later.

15:30.324 --> 15:34.286
Yeah, I've heard of it,
I just never gave it much thought.

15:34.453 --> 15:37.748
- How did we get here?
- You were in a space module.

15:37.915 --> 15:39.708
The wacko that sold me this scam

15:39.875 --> 15:43.337
said that in orbit,
there'd be no brownout.

15:43.503 --> 15:47.048
Yes, several cryonics companies
fell into disrepute

15:47.216 --> 15:51.512
because power failures adversely
affected their refrigeration system.

15:51.678 --> 15:54.181
Their stocks were severely depressed.

15:54.348 --> 15:56.558
The whole deal was a long shot,

15:56.724 --> 16:01.146
but I figured I'd give them
the dough instead of my ex-wives!

16:03.815 --> 16:06.902
But, son, I figured
it was a bunch of hooey.

16:07.485 --> 16:09.029
Hooey?

16:10.322 --> 16:14.618
As in hogwash, malarkey, jive.
An intentional fabrication.

16:14.784 --> 16:16.870
There you go. You got it.

16:18.871 --> 16:22.500
Now, if you didn't contract for this,
who did?

16:22.668 --> 16:25.754
It must have been my husband,
Donald.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.715
If it was new and foolish,
he'd pop for it.

16:29.258 --> 16:32.844
Well, it's the first thing
he bought into that worked.

16:33.511 --> 16:35.721
I, for one, never had a doubt.

16:35.889 --> 16:39.976
My stock in this company must have
split a dozen times by now.

16:40.142 --> 16:43.730
Actually, the process of cryonics
was never more than a fad.

16:43.896 --> 16:46.775
It did not continue beyond
the mid-21 st century.

16:49.861 --> 16:51.821
I need to make a phone call.

16:51.987 --> 16:55.282
- A phone call?
- Yes, I have provided for myself.

16:55.450 --> 16:59.412
I have a substantial portfolio.
It's critical that I check on it.

16:59.578 --> 17:02.582
Let the bank know I'm alive and well.

17:04.375 --> 17:07.044
It's gonna be difficult
at the moment.

17:07.211 --> 17:10.256
Do you at least have a copy
of the Wall Street Journal?

17:11.840 --> 17:13.759
Let's take the Doctor's advice.

17:13.925 --> 17:17.221
Take this very slowly
until we've adjusted.

17:17.387 --> 17:19.682
Then we'll talk to the Captain.

17:20.182 --> 17:23.644
As you know, sir, there is little
available on the Romulans.

17:23.810 --> 17:28.774
- Anything would be helpful.
- They are creatures of extremes.

17:28.940 --> 17:32.987
One moment, violent beyond
description, the next, tender.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.532
They are related to the Vulcans,
but as each race developed,

17:36.698 --> 17:39.075
their differences grew wider.

17:39.243 --> 17:41.119
They're intensely curious.

17:41.286 --> 17:45.916
Their belief in their own superiority
is beyond arrogance.

17:46.083 --> 17:50.336
For some reason,
they have a fascination with humans.

17:50.504 --> 17:54.882
That fascination, more than
anything, has kept the peace.

17:55.050 --> 17:59.012
One other thing.
They will not initiate anything.

17:59.179 --> 18:02.056
They will wait for you
to commit yourself.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.226
Counterpunchers.

18:05.394 --> 18:08.312
Thank you, Counsellor.
That's quite valuable.

18:12.108 --> 18:13.235
Talk.

18:14.361 --> 18:17.280
I'd like me
a thick Kansas City steak

18:17.447 --> 18:21.617
and some country fried potatoes
and a mess of greens.

18:21.785 --> 18:23.453
Hell, forget all that.

18:23.620 --> 18:26.956
Give me a martini,
straight up, with two olives.

18:27.123 --> 18:28.416
For the vitamins.

18:51.272 --> 18:52.523
Is something wrong?

18:53.190 --> 18:58.112
Wrong? Your computer fixed about
the best martini I ever had.

18:58.279 --> 19:00.573
I might get to like this place.

19:00.739 --> 19:03.868
Let's see if the Braves are on.
How do you turn on the TV?

19:04.034 --> 19:06.454
- TV?
- Yeah, the boob tube.

19:06.620 --> 19:09.831
I'd like to see how the Braves
are doing.

19:09.999 --> 19:12.125
Probably still finding ways to lose.

19:13.210 --> 19:15.379
I believe he means television,
sir.

19:16.589 --> 19:21.092
That form of entertainment
did not last much beyond 2040.

19:22.302 --> 19:24.305
Well, what do you guys do?

19:24.471 --> 19:27.516
You don't drink
and you ain't got no TV.

19:27.682 --> 19:29.769
Must be kind of boring, ain't it?

19:31.895 --> 19:33.647
Number One.

19:36.733 --> 19:37.735
Riker, here.

19:37.901 --> 19:40.445
Would you and Mr Data
report to the bridge?

19:40.612 --> 19:41.780
At once, sir.

19:42.531 --> 19:44.866
With whom were you speaking?

19:46.035 --> 19:47.619
- The Captain.
- Good.

19:47.786 --> 19:52.582
Would you tell him I'd like to see
him as soon as it's convenient?

19:52.749 --> 19:56.878
What'll happen to us?
Do we stay here? Go back to Earth?

19:57.044 --> 20:00.591
- That's up to the Captain.
- Well, get him in here.

20:00.757 --> 20:04.344
I have to phone Geneva
about my accounts.

20:04.510 --> 20:08.139
The interest alone
could be enough to buy this ship.

20:08.305 --> 20:11.142
The Yankee's right.
Get the big boy in here.

20:11.643 --> 20:14.520
I'll pass along your request.
Excuse us.

20:14.688 --> 20:17.357
Duty calls. I understand.

20:17.523 --> 20:22.111
Come back later on. We'll find
a couple of low-mileage pit woofies

20:22.278 --> 20:24.405
and help 'em build a memory.

20:32.371 --> 20:36.041
- What is to be done with them, sir?
- I don't know.

20:37.167 --> 20:40.004
Commander,
a low-mileage pit woofie?

20:40.171 --> 20:42.674
This time you've got me.
I haven't a clue.

20:42.840 --> 20:46.094
They are the most unusual humans
I have encountered.

20:46.260 --> 20:49.430
From what I've seen,
there's not much to redeem them.

20:49.596 --> 20:53.558
How did our species
survive the 21 st century?

20:59.315 --> 21:00.232
Report.

21:00.482 --> 21:02.735
We are six hours
from the Neutral Zone.

21:02.901 --> 21:08.239
I have been unable to make contact
with any Federation colony here.

21:08.407 --> 21:11.076
- How many outposts are nearby?
- Nine.

21:11.243 --> 21:13.746
We should assume
they've been destroyed.

21:13.912 --> 21:17.541
- By the Romulans?
- It fits their historical pattern.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.627
We've had no contact
with the Romulans

21:20.794 --> 21:22.963
for 53 years,
seven months, 1 8 days.

21:23.129 --> 21:26.467
We must consider
our information out of date.

21:26.633 --> 21:30.595
So the information they have
about us is also out of date.

21:30.762 --> 21:34.224
I think it's that lack of information
that this is about.

21:34.390 --> 21:35.350
Go on.

21:35.517 --> 21:39.854
The Romulans want a confrontation.
Specifically with us.

21:40.021 --> 21:43.400
- The Enterprise?
- Not by name, but the Federation.

21:43.566 --> 21:46.278
They know the Federation will send
their best,

21:46.444 --> 21:51.991
enabling them to see how far we have
advanced in technology and technique.

21:52.159 --> 21:55.786
- What are you recommending?
- I've no specific recommendation.

21:55.954 --> 21:58.247
Perhaps we should assume
the initiative.

21:58.415 --> 22:01.459
I agree.
This may be our only opportunity.

22:01.626 --> 22:03.211
We should seize it.

22:06.339 --> 22:07.381
Mr Data?

22:07.549 --> 22:12.887
The strategy is built on a single
premise. Their hostile intent.

22:13.053 --> 22:17.100
If the premise is sound,
so is the proposal.

22:18.226 --> 22:21.312
If their intention isn't hostile,
what is it?

22:21.478 --> 22:23.231
Capt Picard?

22:24.398 --> 22:27.109
This is Capt Picard.
To whom am I speaking?

22:27.276 --> 22:29.069
Ralph Offenhouse.

22:29.237 --> 22:30.779
I need to talk to you.

22:30.947 --> 22:34.617
Number One, did you give him
permission to contact me?

22:34.783 --> 22:37.996
No. He must have seen me
use the comm panel.

22:38.246 --> 22:43.000
Listen, Mr... Offenhouse,
we're in a very important conference.

22:43.167 --> 22:44.627
I'm sick ofbeing put off

22:44.793 --> 22:49.130
by you and your staff! This is
the worst-run ship I've been on!

22:49.298 --> 22:53.760
You should learn from the QE2.
That's an efficient operation!

22:54.135 --> 22:56.472
Data, identify. What is a QE2?

22:56.638 --> 23:00.391
It was a passenger liner, which
travelled Earth's Atlantic Ocean

23:00.559 --> 23:02.978
in late 20th, early 21 st centuries.

23:04.145 --> 23:06.731
He's comparing the Enterprise
to a cruise ship?

23:06.899 --> 23:10.194
Capt Picard,
I demand that you see me!

23:10.860 --> 23:14.406
I think I have been
very, very patient.

23:14.573 --> 23:18.785
I demand a phone, or a radio,
or whatever else you have!

23:18.952 --> 23:20.745
Frankly, enough is enough.

23:20.912 --> 23:25.334
Especially considering what
I paid for this procedure!

23:25.500 --> 23:27.877
I must contact my law...

23:31.465 --> 23:32.882
I'm Capt Picard.

23:33.633 --> 23:38.137
Excellent. Maybe we can
get some things straightened out.

23:38.305 --> 23:42.100
Indeed. Those comm panels
are for official ship business.

23:42.267 --> 23:45.478
So, why don't they need
an executive key?

23:47.147 --> 23:49.732
Aboard a starship,
that is not necessary.

23:49.899 --> 23:54.779
We are capable of self-discipline.
You will refrain from using them.

23:54.946 --> 23:55.947
Just a minute...

23:56.113 --> 24:00.451
We are in a serious,
potentially dangerous, situation.

24:00.618 --> 24:04.122
I'm sure it seems very important
to you,

24:04.288 --> 24:06.958
but my situation
is far more critical.

24:07.124 --> 24:10.628
I don't think you're aware
of your situation.

24:10.794 --> 24:12.838
Or of how much time has passed.

24:13.005 --> 24:17.177
I'm fully cognisant
of where I am and when.

24:17.343 --> 24:19.303
But I have more to protect

24:19.470 --> 24:22.431
than a man in your position
could possibly imagine.

24:22.806 --> 24:24.350
No offence meant,

24:24.516 --> 24:28.979
but a military career was never
considered to be... upwardly mobile.

24:29.146 --> 24:31.690
I must contact my lawyer.

24:31.858 --> 24:34.651
Your lawyer's been dead
for centuries.

24:34.819 --> 24:36.486
Of course, I know that.

24:36.654 --> 24:39.865
But he was a full partner
in a very important firm.

24:40.031 --> 24:44.161
Rest assured,
that firm is still operating.

24:49.082 --> 24:51.292
That's what all this is about.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.630
A lot has changed
in the past 300 years.

24:54.796 --> 24:59.008
People are no longer obsessed
with the accumulation of things.

24:59.176 --> 25:04.556
We've eliminated hunger, want,
the need for possessions.

25:04.723 --> 25:06.767
We've grown out of our infancy.

25:07.392 --> 25:11.688
You've got it all wrong.
It has never been about possessions.

25:11.854 --> 25:13.356
It's about power.

25:13.523 --> 25:18.612
- Power to do what?
- To control your life, your destiny.

25:19.863 --> 25:22.657
That kind of control
is an illusion.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.909
Really?

25:25.660 --> 25:27.954
I'm here, aren't l?

25:28.120 --> 25:31.040
I should be dead, but I'm not.

25:36.004 --> 25:37.547
What is it?

25:39.758 --> 25:43.303
I don't know.
It just started and it won't stop.

25:44.595 --> 25:47.014
I keep thinking about my boys.

25:50.476 --> 25:53.980
Counsellor Troi, will you report
to the guest lounge?

25:54.146 --> 25:58.609
Captain, we are approaching
Science Station Delta 05.

25:58.776 --> 26:01.737
Slow to half impulse.
I'm on my way.

26:05.241 --> 26:09.202
Captain, I need to see
that pretty little Doctor of yours.

26:09.370 --> 26:11.246
I'll inform her.

26:11.413 --> 26:14.625
I didn't mean to come on so strong.

26:14.792 --> 26:19.255
It's just I've built my whole life
on knowing what's going on.

26:19.421 --> 26:21.215
For the first time I feel...

26:22.007 --> 26:24.135
..completely out of touch.

26:24.301 --> 26:27.554
It's making me crazy.
You can understand that.

26:27.721 --> 26:30.557
It's the first thing you've said
I do understand.

26:30.724 --> 26:35.187
I'll see what I can do. And
please stay off the comm panels.

26:43.570 --> 26:47.240
Counsellor, will you get
those people under control?

26:47.407 --> 26:50.077
We can't afford this continuing
distraction.

26:50.243 --> 26:51.619
Yes, sir.

26:57.209 --> 26:58.710
Hello.

27:01.379 --> 27:03.006
My name's Deanna.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.426
They sent you here to settle me down?

27:07.928 --> 27:12.515
I'm the ship's Counsellor.
I thought you might want to talk.

27:17.729 --> 27:19.355
The local shrink?

27:19.522 --> 27:24.402
- I'm not familiar with that term.
- It doesn't matter.

27:26.529 --> 27:29.240
You're feeling profoundly sad.

27:30.741 --> 27:32.577
I can't stop crying.

27:33.495 --> 27:35.205
I miss my sons.

27:36.038 --> 27:39.667
And then I think,
I'm here, but... they're gone.

27:42.002 --> 27:44.213
Donald, that's my husband...

27:45.006 --> 27:46.632
I love that man, but,

27:46.800 --> 27:50.261
good intentions aside,
he'd mess up a free lunch.

27:51.012 --> 27:53.973
Why on Earth he ever decided
to do this...?

27:54.139 --> 27:57.268
He must have thought
you would've wanted it.

27:57.434 --> 27:59.728
No, I can tell you what happened.

28:00.854 --> 28:03.690
He couldn't think
about going on alone.

28:03.858 --> 28:08.695
I died and he couldn't face it,
so he had me frozen.

28:08.863 --> 28:11.323
In his mind, I wasn't really gone.

28:14.618 --> 28:18.080
It sounds crazy,
but you had to know Donald.

28:20.124 --> 28:23.544
I wish I knew
what happened to my children.

28:23.710 --> 28:26.588
Did they marry?
Did they have kids?

28:27.964 --> 28:30.341
Let's see if we can find out.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.889
Computer, this is Counsellor Troi.

28:36.515 --> 28:40.269
Request personal history on...
What are their names?

28:42.020 --> 28:44.772
Tommy, he's eight, and Eddie is five.

28:44.940 --> 28:47.651
Full names, date and place ofbirth.

28:49.569 --> 28:52.405
They were born in Secaucus,
that's in Jersey.

28:52.572 --> 28:56.076
Can this really work? Can this
tell me what happened to them?

28:56.242 --> 29:00.913
There must be a record somewhere.
There's a good chance we'll find it.

29:01.081 --> 29:05.376
Well, whether we do or not,
I want to thank you for trying.

29:08.379 --> 29:13.051
Date of birth...
Tommy was born February 1 7th.

29:13.426 --> 29:15.887
I need something
to jump-start the morning

29:16.053 --> 29:18.264
and something else
to shut down the night.

29:18.431 --> 29:20.474
You have no medical need.

29:20.642 --> 29:24.770
It ain't a matter of need, darling.
It's a matter of survival.

29:24.937 --> 29:25.980
Sorry.

29:26.147 --> 29:29.233
Well, old Watosh'll scuffle along
best he can.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.319
Where's that fella
with the strange face?

29:32.487 --> 29:33.529
I beg your pardon?

29:33.695 --> 29:36.282
Whatshisname. The android fella.

29:37.367 --> 29:40.453
- You mean Lt Cmdr Data?
- That's the one.

29:40.619 --> 29:43.580
- I'll tell him you want him.
- Much obliged.

29:43.748 --> 29:47.376
You're just about
the prettiest doctor I ever seen.

29:50.671 --> 29:52.298
Much obliged.

29:56.301 --> 29:59.262
This is amazing. It's all right here.

29:59.846 --> 30:02.307
Ten generations of your progeny.

30:04.184 --> 30:06.604
Everyone I've ever known is dead.

30:09.899 --> 30:13.485
Do you mind? I'd like to be alone.

30:14.527 --> 30:16.112
No. Not at all.

30:29.542 --> 30:30.752
You asked to see me?

30:30.919 --> 30:35.548
I'm about to go outta my mind.
Sitting here just don't get it.

30:35.716 --> 30:39.302
- What say you and I put on a party?
- A celebration?

30:39.469 --> 30:43.639
Nothing that fancy. Just some folks,
some suds, and some sounds.

30:43.807 --> 30:46.184
It's just something to do.

30:46.350 --> 30:48.937
- I will speak to the Captain.
- Great! Do that.

30:49.103 --> 30:52.357
Inquiry. You are not having
as much difficulty

30:52.523 --> 30:55.234
adjusting to your circumstances
as the others.

30:55.402 --> 30:59.280
You mean being on this tub,
400 years from where I started?

30:59.446 --> 31:03.075
Heck, it's the same dance,
it's just a different tune.

31:03.243 --> 31:05.495
Does anybody here have a guitar?

31:05.661 --> 31:08.581
No. But the computer
can replicate one.

31:08.748 --> 31:11.793
I want one
while I still remember the chords.

31:11.959 --> 31:15.546
We're approaching the Neutral Zone.
Report to the bridge.

31:15.712 --> 31:16.756
I must leave.

31:18.382 --> 31:20.551
What's this Neutral Zone?

31:20.760 --> 31:23.930
A buffer between the Romulan
Empire and the Federation.

31:25.014 --> 31:28.517
- Why does that make me nervous?
- I do not know.

31:28.684 --> 31:31.812
We won't be inviting
these Romulans to our party.

31:32.646 --> 31:36.066
No.
That would not be... appropriate.

31:45.367 --> 31:47.077
Captain's log, supplemental.

31:47.286 --> 31:50.038
We have arrived at
the edge of the Neutral Zone.

31:50.206 --> 31:53.124
We will have an opportunity
to learn firsthand

31:53.292 --> 31:55.711
what happened
to our distant outpost.

31:55.878 --> 32:00.298
Captain, there is nothing left
of outpost Delta 05.

32:02.008 --> 32:04.719
Must have been one hell
of an explosion.

32:04.887 --> 32:08.139
Sensors indicate no evidence
of conventional attack.

32:09.390 --> 32:11.727
Can you determine what happened?

32:12.644 --> 32:14.854
The outpost was not just destroyed.

32:15.022 --> 32:19.109
It's as though some great force
scooped it off the planet.

32:19.734 --> 32:22.320
Could it have been
a natural phenomenon?

32:22.486 --> 32:24.656
Insufficient information, sir.

32:30.870 --> 32:33.164
Set the course for the next station.

32:42.131 --> 32:45.844
I have spent my entire career
being able to tell

32:46.010 --> 32:48.471
when the other guy's mouth is dry.

32:48.637 --> 32:52.767
There is something going on here.
Something serious.

32:52.933 --> 32:56.270
The tension level on this ship
has jumped up.

32:56.437 --> 32:58.981
Even if you are right,
what can we do?

32:59.148 --> 33:03.318
These old boys don't need us
telling them where the bear sits.

33:03.486 --> 33:05.821
Look what that fella made for me.

33:08.782 --> 33:10.201
How did he do that?

33:10.367 --> 33:14.538
He called it pattern replication.
It plays real good, too.

33:14.706 --> 33:20.419
I tell you, there is a situation
developing that directly affects us.

33:20.628 --> 33:22.922
All you can talk about
is that guitar!

33:24.048 --> 33:26.800
They don't need us
swimming in their soup.

33:26.967 --> 33:29.803
So relax and let 'em do their jobs.

33:29.970 --> 33:32.139
That may be alright for you,

33:32.305 --> 33:36.852
but I am not willing to allow
my fate to be decided by others!

33:37.019 --> 33:39.396
I want to know what is going on.

33:44.068 --> 33:46.403
We are approaching Tarod IX.

33:47.154 --> 33:49.406
The condition is identical.

33:49.573 --> 33:51.575
Everyone and everything is gone.

33:51.741 --> 33:54.286
I strongly recommend
we go to red alert.

33:54.453 --> 33:57.122
If the Romulans
have improved their cloaking,

33:57.289 --> 33:59.416
and we'd be fools to doubt it,

33:59.582 --> 34:02.085
we should assume
a more defensive posture.

34:02.294 --> 34:06.881
I agree. I recommend we go
immediately to battle stations.

34:07.049 --> 34:10.886
I appreciate your advice,
but it is no time for rash actions.

34:11.052 --> 34:14.138
There are three other stations
to visit.

34:14.306 --> 34:16.725
Let's proceed in an orderly manner.

34:16.891 --> 34:20.020
May we at least go to yellow alert?

34:20.186 --> 34:22.230
Yes, Number One. Make it so.

34:27.568 --> 34:29.402
All decks, yellow alert.

34:52.217 --> 34:53.928
Let's see...

34:56.429 --> 34:58.640
I want to go to the...

35:02.144 --> 35:03.979
Where would the Captain be?

35:04.146 --> 35:07.650
Capt Picard is located
on the main bridge.

35:07.816 --> 35:10.778
Well, then,
take me to the main bridge.

35:10.945 --> 35:13.698
Captain, my sensors indicate
a disturbance.

35:13.864 --> 35:16.366
It is large and moving.
I cannot get a lock.

35:16.534 --> 35:18.911
Nor can I get it
on the viewscreen.

35:19.077 --> 35:20.412
Shields up.

35:21.539 --> 35:25.542
I recommend we transfer power to
phasers and arm the photon torpedoes.

35:25.709 --> 35:29.004
Wait. If it is Romulan,
they will read our intent.

35:29.171 --> 35:32.007
It'll force them
into taking a similar posture.

35:32.216 --> 35:35.552
- We don't want battle.
- This is sufficient evidence.

35:35.718 --> 35:38.972
Outposts have been destroyed.
Countless lives lost.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.598
I have a positive lock.

35:40.766 --> 35:43.101
They're disengaging their cloaking.

35:43.268 --> 35:47.188
They'll only be vulnerable for
an instant as they become visible.

35:47.356 --> 35:50.692
Captain,
this may be our only chance.

35:50.858 --> 35:52.236
No.

35:55.447 --> 35:59.284
- Where are they?
- The signal is weakening.

36:00.077 --> 36:01.703
I've lost them.

36:03.663 --> 36:04.789
Damn.

36:08.209 --> 36:11.129
Mr Data, are your sensors
picking up anything?

36:11.295 --> 36:13.882
You should be detecting
a disturbance.

36:14.048 --> 36:15.217
Negative, sir.

36:15.383 --> 36:18.053
We wanted to know
if they'd improved cloaking.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.554
We have our answer.

36:19.720 --> 36:24.434
They wanted to determine our intent.
To see if we would fire.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.353
Who the hell are they?

36:27.770 --> 36:30.023
Get that man off the bridge. Now!

36:30.189 --> 36:31.774
I'm not going anywhere.

36:33.193 --> 36:34.819
They're back.

37:03.305 --> 37:04.348
Amazing.

37:04.515 --> 37:08.059
I never thought I'd see
a Romulan vessel so close.

37:08.227 --> 37:10.979
Last time we encountered them
was decades ago.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.814
Cost thousands of lives.

37:12.982 --> 37:15.358
I can believe that.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.487
Stay calm, everyone.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.656
Open hailing frequencies.

37:20.822 --> 37:24.284
Captain, these are Romulans.

37:24.450 --> 37:26.828
They are without honour.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.873
They killed my parents
in an attack on Khitomer

37:30.040 --> 37:32.543
when they were meant to be
our allies.

37:32.709 --> 37:36.672
They believe humans and Klingons
are a waste of skin.

37:36.838 --> 37:41.468
Control your emotions.
Please, open hailing frequencies.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.183
Hailing frequencies open.

37:48.349 --> 37:53.021
Romulan vessel, this is Capt Jean-Luc
Picard of the USS Enterprise.

37:55.231 --> 37:58.526
Sensors indicate
all of their systems are armed, sir.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.195
But they've not fired.

38:03.656 --> 38:06.326
I am Cmdr Tebok.

38:07.952 --> 38:11.538
Commander, you have crossed
the Neutral Zone.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.750
This is Federation territory.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.085
It was necessary.

38:16.252 --> 38:18.587
It might be viewed as aggression.

38:18.755 --> 38:22.633
If our intent were aggression,
you would not be here now.

38:22.800 --> 38:27.888
If we go to war, let us be sure
it is for the right reason.

38:28.973 --> 38:33.561
We are here because our outposts,
which border on the Neutral Zone,

38:33.769 --> 38:35.437
were also attacked.

38:35.604 --> 38:39.274
Destroyed in the same manner
as your own.

38:39.442 --> 38:43.404
Even so, what gives them the right
to enter Federation space?

38:43.570 --> 38:46.157
Silence your dog.

38:46.907 --> 38:49.284
Lt Worf's question is valid.

38:49.452 --> 38:53.747
To even ask such a question
implies that we need permission.

38:53.914 --> 38:55.540
We do not.

38:55.708 --> 38:58.419
Do you think that we attacked
your outposts?

38:58.585 --> 39:01.964
Once we realised
the level of destruction,

39:02.548 --> 39:05.134
we knew
it could not have been you.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.554
Who is responsible?

39:12.891 --> 39:15.018
They haven't got a clue.

39:16.186 --> 39:20.274
They're hoping you know.
But they're too arrogant to ask.

39:20.440 --> 39:25.361
- You're out of line, mister.
- But it's a correct assessment.

39:25.529 --> 39:28.699
We do not know
who is responsible.

39:29.700 --> 39:35.163
Why entire outposts, on both sides,
have been carried off.

39:35.330 --> 39:37.498
I would like to offer a proposal.

39:37.666 --> 39:42.128
An alliance? Between the Romulans
and the Federation?

39:42.546 --> 39:47.758
Nothing so grandiose.
Just this. Cooperation.

39:48.968 --> 39:50.762
There was an intent here.

39:50.928 --> 39:55.767
Whoever or whatever did this,
is more powerful than either of us.

39:55.933 --> 39:57.643
Let's collaborate.

39:57.811 --> 40:01.397
Let's share whatever we learn about
what has happened here.

40:02.732 --> 40:05.734
Agreed. On this one issue.

40:05.902 --> 40:11.865
And only ifit is convenient
and appropriate at the time.

40:14.285 --> 40:17.747
Because your actions
are those of a thoughtful man,

40:17.913 --> 40:19.665
I'll tell you this.

40:19.831 --> 40:24.253
Matters more urgent
caused our absence.

40:24.920 --> 40:28.299
Now,... witness the result.

40:29.049 --> 40:31.135
Outposts destroyed.

40:31.676 --> 40:35.556
Expansion of the Federation...
everywhere.

40:36.431 --> 40:37.807
Yes.

40:37.975 --> 40:41.102
We have indeed been negligent.

40:42.437 --> 40:44.106
But no more.

40:44.272 --> 40:47.234
Commander, we have made
some progress here.

40:47.442 --> 40:50.362
Let's not ruin it
with unnecessary posturing.

40:50.529 --> 40:53.281
Your presence is not wanted.

40:54.241 --> 40:57.118
Do you understand my meaning?

40:58.578 --> 41:02.082
We... are back.

41:08.881 --> 41:12.467
I think our lives just became
a lot more complicated.

41:20.099 --> 41:22.018
Get him off my bridge.

41:35.323 --> 41:36.949
I've found something.

41:39.619 --> 41:43.748
I've located a family
living just outside lndianapolis.

41:44.331 --> 41:46.709
The man's name is Thomas Raymond.

41:46.876 --> 41:50.421
That's my son's name. Tommy.

41:50.588 --> 41:53.258
Computer,
let us see Thomas Raymond.

41:56.135 --> 41:57.845
Oh, my God!

41:58.679 --> 42:00.847
That's Donald. That's my husband.

42:01.015 --> 42:05.645
Actually, it's your great-great-
great-great-great-grandson.

42:07.939 --> 42:09.524
He's the spitting image.

42:09.690 --> 42:13.820
Well, I have his address.
When you get back you can visit him.

42:15.321 --> 42:19.032
No. I'll be out of time. A relic.

42:19.908 --> 42:23.328
Perhaps. But it's a place to start.

42:23.996 --> 42:26.457
After all, he is family.

42:28.583 --> 42:30.418
There's no denying that.

42:32.254 --> 42:34.006
Here's what I propose.

42:34.589 --> 42:39.928
I have arranged a rendezvous with
USS Charleston, bound for Earth.

42:40.096 --> 42:43.682
- They'll deliver you there.
- Then what will happen to us?

42:43.849 --> 42:47.477
There's no trace of my money.
My office is gone.

42:48.103 --> 42:50.772
What will I do? How will I live?

42:52.190 --> 42:56.862
This is the 24th century.
Material needs no longer exist.

42:59.489 --> 43:01.283
Then what's the challenge?

43:03.869 --> 43:07.455
The challenge, Mr Offenhouse,
is to improve yourself.

43:07.623 --> 43:09.999
To enrich yourself.

43:10.709 --> 43:12.710
Enjoy it.

43:13.670 --> 43:15.464
Well, one good thing is,

43:15.630 --> 43:18.632
since everyone's forgotten
everything I ever did,

43:18.800 --> 43:20.676
it'll all be brand spanking new.

43:20.844 --> 43:23.805
I'll be a bigger hit than I ever was.

43:24.847 --> 43:27.391
Perhaps so. Anything is possible.

43:28.184 --> 43:31.687
What say you, son?
You'd make a helluva sideman.

43:32.981 --> 43:35.900
That offer does present
a certain fascination.

43:43.616 --> 43:47.286
Captain, I've plotted a course
to intercept the Charleston.

43:47.495 --> 43:51.248
But they say they're making
an extended stop at Arloff IX.

43:51.416 --> 43:53.167
Your point, Mr La Forge?

43:53.333 --> 43:57.672
We could have our guests
at Starbase 39 Sierra in five days.

43:57.838 --> 43:59.798
Take months off their journey.

44:00.591 --> 44:05.095
The extra time will allow them
to acclimate before reaching Earth.

44:05.262 --> 44:07.223
It's a pity we can't take them.

44:07.389 --> 44:10.852
Having them here
is like a visit from the past.

44:11.018 --> 44:13.854
That would take us in
the wrong direction.

44:14.020 --> 44:17.817
Our mission is to go forward.
And it's just begun.

44:18.775 --> 44:21.779
Set velocity. Warp six.

44:22.863 --> 44:25.324
Aye, sir. Warp six.

44:26.033 --> 44:27.993
There's still much to do.

44:28.785 --> 44:30.538
Still so much to learn.

44:35.750 --> 44:37.210
Engage.
