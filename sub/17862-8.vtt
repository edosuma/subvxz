WEBVTT

00:01.312 --> 00:04.457
It won't be easy carrying
your dead child to term.

00:04.483 --> 00:05.669
My baby.

00:05.764 --> 00:09.366
Jarvis finds a girl in trouble
with an imminent delivery,

00:09.367 --> 00:11.581
as soon as she goes into labour,
you're induced -

00:11.651 --> 00:14.703
and you emerge with a bonny
bouncing babe in your arms.

00:14.744 --> 00:18.690
I understand now why it meant
so much to you to learn about Anna.

00:18.776 --> 00:20.477
It's a miracle to me.

00:20.530 --> 00:21.898
They say your husband's alive.

00:22.063 --> 00:24.445
A photograph taken by my man
a week ago.

00:24.563 --> 00:26.565
Yes. It is him.

00:26.866 --> 00:28.146
I must go to him.

00:28.186 --> 00:30.951
I'd fight if there was a point,
but there's not.

00:30.969 --> 00:33.273
Gino and I have set the date
of our wedding.

00:33.357 --> 00:35.564
And you... are not invited.

00:35.778 --> 00:37.720
You're not welcome to stay again.

00:38.118 --> 00:40.947
<i>If it seems right,
you bring him home.</i>

00:40.982 --> 00:44.444
- I couldn't do that.
- If it's right, you have to.

02:12.127 --> 02:15.162
Sarah!

02:15.163 --> 02:17.001
Rene!

02:17.002 --> 02:18.839
No!

02:41.699 --> 02:43.937
Forgive me.

02:50.252 --> 02:52.489
I wanted to spare you.

02:52.490 --> 02:54.887
I know.

02:56.886 --> 02:59.243
Who did find him?

02:59.245 --> 03:01.679
Dr Duvalier.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.237
Etienne?
Two months ago.

03:04.238 --> 03:06.116
His first day on a new post

03:06.117 --> 03:08.834
he sees a man in a ward
for the war damaged.

03:08.835 --> 03:11.591
He thinks, "It cannot be.
He is dead."

03:11.592 --> 03:13.869
But it is Rene.

03:13.872 --> 03:16.307
He had been there for six years.

03:17.307 --> 03:19.184
Brain-damaged, not talking.

03:19.185 --> 03:22.183
Perhaps not wanting to.
They do not know.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.820
Jean Manais saw him shot.

03:26.817 --> 03:32.133
Perhaps a tired guard,
one with a conscience maybe.

03:34.492 --> 03:37.170
I don't care what state he's in.

03:38.168 --> 03:40.645
I need to see him.

03:40.646 --> 03:42.524
Which hospital?

03:44.123 --> 03:47.198
He is with me now.

03:47.199 --> 03:48.998
Here.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.518
Rene.

04:54.417 --> 04:58.576
My Darling... It's me.

04:59.934 --> 05:02.170
It's Sarah!

05:12.246 --> 05:17.164
I'm here Rene.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.531
I'm here.

05:29.106 --> 05:31.106
George.

05:33.983 --> 05:35.861
George?

05:39.537 --> 05:43.094
Wake up. Hmm?

05:45.092 --> 05:47.808
This is the first time he hasn't
managed to take himself to bed.

05:47.809 --> 05:49.647
Where is he?
In the sitting room.

05:49.648 --> 05:52.086
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing that concerns you.

05:52.087 --> 05:54.084
Is it Father? I'll help.

05:54.085 --> 05:57.040
Anna, he doesn't need the added shame
of your seeing him this way.

05:57.041 --> 05:59.000
Don't pretend you care
about his feelings.

05:59.001 --> 06:01.158
It's alright. I'll see to it.

06:02.517 --> 06:04.394
Anna, stop.

06:04.395 --> 06:06.992
Stop! She's right. He'd hate
for you to see him like this.

06:06.993 --> 06:08.630
I told you, I don't need protecting.

06:08.631 --> 06:10.509
I'm thinking about him, not you.

06:10.510 --> 06:12.986
And this war you've declared on
Grandmother is not helping. Anna!

06:12.987 --> 06:15.703
Anna, An...

06:15.704 --> 06:17.581
Go upstairs.

06:17.583 --> 06:20.420
She did this.
Listen to me.

06:20.421 --> 06:23.656
Look, every time you attack her
it feeds his anger

06:23.657 --> 06:26.414
and every night he has to
come down here and drown it.

06:26.415 --> 06:30.298
If you can't control yourself with
Grandmother you need to leave...

06:31.130 --> 06:32.849
...for his sake.

06:39.645 --> 06:41.722
Come on. Time for bed.

06:41.723 --> 06:44.001
Sarah...
Put your arm around me.

06:45.838 --> 06:48.197
Come on.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.113
You fell asleep.

06:51.114 --> 06:52.872
I'm alright.

06:53.832 --> 06:56.708
It's... it's my little girl.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.428
Don't you ever listen?

07:40.310 --> 07:43.226
And so to bed.

07:44.426 --> 07:47.302
Was there a point to sitting here?

07:47.304 --> 07:49.820
I like feeling close to him.

07:49.821 --> 07:52.498
Your brother-in-law?

07:52.499 --> 07:54.896
The worms had Elaine
long ago. Why not?

07:55.857 --> 07:59.051
Don't let me forget
to stay in your good books.

07:59.052 --> 08:03.249
Do what I'm paying you for and
there will be no cause for concern.

08:04.208 --> 08:06.206
Bed for us too, I think.

08:06.207 --> 08:09.283
How many beds are there
at this farm of yours?

08:09.284 --> 08:12.799
Spare me your tawdry innuendo.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.799
Drive!

08:28.466 --> 08:31.182
Duty calls.
Stay!

08:31.183 --> 08:33.302
It's tempting.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.183
Thank you for a wonderful night.

08:41.255 --> 08:44.291
There's an irony
in your concern for Mother's heart

08:44.292 --> 08:46.529
given this week suggests
she doesn't have one.

08:46.530 --> 08:49.530
I'm biting my tongue with Anna.
Don't you start too.

08:50.327 --> 08:53.402
Tell George I'll drop by.
Come now.

08:53.403 --> 08:56.439
I'd rather not rub his nose
in our happiness.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.677
Life goes on. He knows that.

08:58.678 --> 09:01.076
Right at this moment? Not so sure.

09:39.882 --> 09:41.399
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.998
I'm glad you're both here.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.395
I'm pleased you've
decided to join us.

09:45.396 --> 09:47.273
I won't be staying.

09:47.274 --> 09:49.670
I wanted to apologise
for my behaviour of late.

09:49.671 --> 09:51.110
There's no need.
Please.

09:51.111 --> 09:52.749
There is. It won't happen again.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.387
I'm pleased to hear it.

09:54.388 --> 09:57.225
I'm sorry that you had to
see me like that.

09:57.226 --> 09:59.103
You're not the one
who should be apolog...

09:59.104 --> 10:00.902
Anna!
It's true.

10:01.941 --> 10:06.735
Anna was thinking of moving in
with Aunt Carolyn, weren't you?

10:06.736 --> 10:09.013
I'm happy to stay if you need me,

10:09.014 --> 10:11.332
but things might be better
if I'm not here.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.970
I don't want to drive you out.

10:12.971 --> 10:15.088
It's not you.

10:15.089 --> 10:17.854
Your aunt will be glad
of the company, I'm sure.

10:24.321 --> 10:26.798
A wise choice.

10:26.799 --> 10:29.077
Don't.

10:30.786 --> 10:33.144
Excuse me.

10:37.297 --> 10:41.532
Your father's apology,
Anna's departure, both to the good.

10:45.538 --> 10:47.414
She makes me sick.

10:47.416 --> 10:49.093
You two at it again?

10:49.094 --> 10:51.331
She breaks his heart
and then she just sits there

10:51.332 --> 10:52.890
blaming everyone else
for what's happening.

10:52.891 --> 10:54.809
You're upset. I understand.
But you've got to...

10:54.810 --> 10:56.926
I hate her!
No, no, you don't.

10:56.927 --> 10:58.524
Yes, I do.
You're getting carried away.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.563
I'm not a child, Jack.

11:00.564 --> 11:03.280
Fine, but whatever you're feeling,

11:03.281 --> 11:04.958
just remember your grandmother
hasn't been well.

11:04.959 --> 11:06.798
Go easy on her.
I hope it kills her.

11:06.799 --> 11:08.437
Anna!
We'd all be better off!

11:08.438 --> 11:11.434
Stop it! Stop acting
like a spoilt bloody brat.

11:11.435 --> 11:14.151
You can't talk to me like that.
Well, someone has to!

11:14.152 --> 11:16.069
You've got no right to...
I have every right!

11:16.070 --> 11:17.306
You're not my father!

11:19.786 --> 11:22.543
I'm her doctor

11:22.544 --> 11:24.822
and I'm your friend.

11:34.189 --> 11:37.352
I'm ashamed to admit
that I abandoned you.

11:38.270 --> 11:41.131
I searched for you
for a long time, but...

11:43.163 --> 11:45.179
not long enough.

11:48.785 --> 11:52.193
I don't know if you can forgive me.

11:58.223 --> 12:02.299
If you're in there, my darling,
I won't give up on you again.

12:02.849 --> 12:05.964
I promise you.

12:44.462 --> 12:46.979
Dr Jarvis has found a suitable girl,

12:46.980 --> 12:49.777
the perfect candidate, he says.

12:49.778 --> 12:51.535
Did he say when it might be?

12:51.536 --> 12:53.334
Any time now.

12:54.972 --> 12:58.768
It all feels very real suddenly.

12:58.769 --> 13:00.526
It will be soon.

13:00.527 --> 13:03.404
What will happen to my baby?

13:03.405 --> 13:07.681
It will be taken away.
It will be as if it never was.

13:07.682 --> 13:09.399
A proper burial surely?

13:09.400 --> 13:12.516
What we're doing is illegal.
But I can't just...

13:12.517 --> 13:16.314
As hard as it is,
you have to be strong on that.

13:21.469 --> 13:24.066
I should pack for the hospital.

13:25.025 --> 13:26.664
Be ready.

13:48.125 --> 13:51.201
Everything alright there, Mr Bligh?

13:51.202 --> 13:53.438
Checking the fences.

13:53.439 --> 13:56.755
Have you heard from Missy?
I don't expect to.

13:56.756 --> 13:59.993
You know, if you have a mind to

13:59.994 --> 14:02.790
there's always a cold beer
with your name on it at my place.

14:02.791 --> 14:05.748
No need to mag.

14:05.749 --> 14:08.425
I think I've overdone the alcohol.

14:08.426 --> 14:10.743
I might take you up
on a cuppa, though.

14:10.744 --> 14:12.461
Righto, then.

14:12.462 --> 14:14.380
I brew her up pretty strong.

14:16.220 --> 14:18.176
I'll see you.

14:24.692 --> 14:28.247
Well, it's up.
How about some time away, huh?

14:28.248 --> 14:31.044
No, I have to face
the consequences of my actions

14:31.045 --> 14:33.042
and the only way
to resolve matters with George

14:33.043 --> 14:34.800
is to bring things to a head.

14:34.801 --> 14:36.399
Even if it kills you?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.756
You're being Shakespearean.

14:38.757 --> 14:42.195
Any niggles at all, I want to know.

14:44.634 --> 14:48.068
Do you know
the greatest irony in all of this?

14:48.069 --> 14:52.705
I returned from Sydney with
a new admiration for Miss Adams.

14:53.705 --> 14:55.582
I was close to accepting her.

14:55.583 --> 15:00.098
If not for Regina's discovery,
I would have.

15:00.099 --> 15:01.856
Well, have you told George?

15:01.857 --> 15:06.293
Oh, it would simply sound like
a grovelling plea for forgiveness.

15:06.294 --> 15:09.353
Well, what if in the long run
he doesn't forgive you?

15:10.770 --> 15:14.686
Then I shall have to consider
doing the unthinkable. Hmph.

15:27.833 --> 15:29.831
G'day!

15:29.833 --> 15:31.669
I heard it was sold.

15:31.670 --> 15:33.987
That's right.

15:33.988 --> 15:36.984
I'm Roy Briggs. I've been
looking after the place.

15:36.985 --> 15:40.341
Now, no offence, old mate, but you
look like a bit of a city slicker.

15:40.342 --> 15:44.178
So if you wanna get rid of any
of this stock, just give us a hoy.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.175
I'm not the owner.

15:46.176 --> 15:48.893
Mrs Standish is.

15:48.894 --> 15:51.971
Mr Briggs, I believe.

15:51.972 --> 15:54.049
No doubt Miss Adams mentioned me.

15:55.008 --> 15:56.606
Too right she did.

15:56.607 --> 15:59.244
He's interested in the cows.

15:59.245 --> 16:01.723
Not that one, I'm not.

16:08.956 --> 16:11.554
Warm country welcome.

16:14.231 --> 16:17.667
If you're worried about
getting in the way, then don't.

16:17.668 --> 16:20.186
Jack and I love having you here.

16:21.705 --> 16:25.660
You and Jack,
it all happened very suddenly.

16:25.661 --> 16:27.419
Love can be sudden.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.976
So intense so quickly.

16:29.977 --> 16:31.934
Yes.

16:31.935 --> 16:35.811
I've had the silliest thought.

16:35.812 --> 16:37.610
Yes?

16:39.009 --> 16:42.923
Nothing. It... it feels good
to be away from Grandmother.

16:42.924 --> 16:46.162
I'm sure.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.396
I know what you're gonna ask.
It's gonna have to wait.

16:51.397 --> 16:53.555
You said a week
and it's been a week.

16:53.556 --> 16:55.833
I know...
We need to fill Sarah's position.

16:55.834 --> 16:57.631
We're understaffed.
We're managing.

16:57.632 --> 16:59.309
Just.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.268
We need to face facts.

17:01.269 --> 17:03.466
I'll put the word out.

17:03.467 --> 17:04.983
I will.

17:12.078 --> 17:13.752
Alma!

17:13.756 --> 17:17.351
Dr Duncan, I saw you come...
Are you sick?

17:17.352 --> 17:20.347
Uh, no. I have had a touch
of the collywobbles.

17:20.348 --> 17:23.545
But it's Miss Carolyn
I'm worried about.

17:23.546 --> 17:25.544
It's probably none of my business,

17:25.545 --> 17:29.819
but as a friend of Mrs Bligh's
her concerns are mine.

17:29.820 --> 17:31.338
The point, Doris?

17:31.340 --> 17:33.377
I presume she's ill - Miss Carolyn?

17:33.378 --> 17:35.456
Not that I know of.

17:35.457 --> 17:38.892
You see, I was delivering
pamphlets for the CWA

17:38.892 --> 17:42.249
and I couldn't help but see your car

17:42.251 --> 17:43.806
pulling away from
the cottage so early -

17:43.808 --> 17:45.685
naturally I thought she'd taken ill.

17:45.686 --> 17:48.445
I can't imagine another reason.

17:52.880 --> 17:56.236
I was leaving the cottage
because I stayed the night.

17:56.237 --> 17:59.353
Carolyn and I are seeing each other.

17:59.354 --> 18:02.391
As for Sarah,
I'm guessing she's not coming back.

18:02.392 --> 18:04.349
Anna and Gino
are still getting married.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.067
George is a broken man

18:06.067 --> 18:09.024
and Elizabeth Bligh has more trouble
than she knows what to do with.

18:09.025 --> 18:12.100
Miss anything?

18:12.101 --> 18:16.097
No, that was very thorough,
not that I care to know.

18:16.098 --> 18:18.696
Good. Do us all a favour
and stay out of it.

18:22.332 --> 18:24.803
The last thing
that family needs is gossip.

18:25.169 --> 18:26.969
Indeed.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.762
What was that about?

18:32.763 --> 18:36.560
No-one likes a stickybeak,
Alma, dear.

18:40.836 --> 18:43.192
Hello, George.

18:43.194 --> 18:47.028
I know I'm not welcome,
but as we'll be neighbours...

18:47.029 --> 18:48.627
Neighbours?

18:48.628 --> 18:51.265
I signed the deed on that
quaint little Walker farm.

18:51.267 --> 18:53.104
And there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

18:53.105 --> 18:55.661
George Bligh, Adam Farrell.

18:55.662 --> 18:57.979
Adam's come to give
his opinion on my purchase

18:57.980 --> 18:59.977
and I've come to value his opinion.

18:59.978 --> 19:02.175
Mr Bligh.
Mr Farrell.

19:02.176 --> 19:04.893
We've had a rather whirlwind week,
haven't we, darling?

19:04.894 --> 19:07.252
We met on the flight home.
I see.

19:07.253 --> 19:08.808
I'd love your advice on the property

19:08.809 --> 19:11.247
if at all possible,
the practicalities.

19:11.248 --> 19:13.125
I'm no use on that count.

19:13.126 --> 19:16.522
I know you love fixing things
and Lord knows it needs fixing.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.876
I'm surprised
you thought it appropriate.

19:19.801 --> 19:23.036
I want to be close by,
close to my only family.

19:23.037 --> 19:25.874
It can be made cosy, I'm sure.

19:25.875 --> 19:28.712
Nice to meet you, Mr Farrell.

19:28.713 --> 19:30.669
George, wait.

19:32.029 --> 19:34.305
I accept you may never forgive me,

19:34.306 --> 19:37.543
but please don't prevent
my seeing James and Anna

19:37.544 --> 19:39.542
and the little one when it comes.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.099
We'll see.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.377
That gives me hope.

19:44.378 --> 19:46.774
Would you mind if I freshened up?

19:46.775 --> 19:48.493
Of course.

19:48.494 --> 19:50.612
Keep Adam company.

19:54.009 --> 19:56.527
She regrets deeply what happened.

19:58.245 --> 20:02.162
I'm glad she has someone
concerned about her. Excuse me.

20:05.198 --> 20:08.075
You cannot seriously
intend living there.

20:08.076 --> 20:11.392
It can be made habitable
with George's help.

20:11.393 --> 20:13.631
It gives me reason to see him.

20:13.632 --> 20:15.348
And this new man is what?

20:15.349 --> 20:17.746
Some misguided attempt
to make George jealous?

20:17.747 --> 20:21.042
I'll be appealing to a far more
potent emotion than that.

20:22.902 --> 20:25.819
How are things with you two?
Healing the rift?

20:25.820 --> 20:29.216
Would you please leave?
Clearly not.

20:29.217 --> 20:34.491
Do you have any idea how
completely tiresome this is?

20:34.492 --> 20:37.728
How completely tiresome you are?!

20:37.729 --> 20:40.326
I've softened him more in 10 minutes
than you have in...

20:40.327 --> 20:41.885
Get out!

20:43.844 --> 20:46.759
Go on. Did you hear me?

20:46.760 --> 20:50.117
Leave! Enough!

20:53.275 --> 20:54.873
My pills...

20:57.511 --> 20:59.470
Oh...

21:21.369 --> 21:24.686
It's in your best interests
to support me.

21:48.491 --> 21:53.287
This, uh, town you wrote of...

21:53.288 --> 21:55.005
Inverness.

21:55.006 --> 21:58.402
It seems very special to you.

21:58.403 --> 22:00.722
It healed my soul.

22:02.401 --> 22:05.237
What is his name?

22:10.113 --> 22:12.271
How would you...

22:14.309 --> 22:16.866
Would you permit me
to take Rene there?

22:17.946 --> 22:20.943
To Inverness?
To heal.

22:24.100 --> 22:28.576
Let us hope you have reason to.

22:35.447 --> 22:41.658
Sweet dreams. I'll be next to you.

22:44.202 --> 22:47.439
Shh, you're safe now.

23:56.616 --> 23:58.535
Thank you, Colleen.

24:01.052 --> 24:04.349
Livvy.
Good morning, darling.

24:04.370 --> 24:05.887
You're up early.

24:05.888 --> 24:08.165
I couldn't sleep.

24:08.166 --> 24:10.562
Is everything alright?

24:10.563 --> 24:13.759
I just wanted to hear your voice.

24:13.760 --> 24:16.677
I'm glad,

24:16.678 --> 24:19.502
as long as you're enjoying yourself
and relaxing.

24:21.873 --> 24:23.471
Well, you are, aren't you?

24:23.472 --> 24:26.627
Yes, yes, of course.

24:26.629 --> 24:29.426
Prudence and I thought
we might go to 'Call Me Madam'.

24:29.427 --> 24:30.984
It's the newest musical.

24:30.985 --> 24:34.022
Oh, that sounds fun.

24:37.220 --> 24:40.175
James...
There is something wrong.

24:40.176 --> 24:42.174
I'm coming to get you.
No, don't.

24:42.175 --> 24:44.573
Really, I am fine. I just...

24:45.532 --> 24:47.729
I miss you.

24:47.730 --> 24:50.008
I miss you too.

24:50.968 --> 24:53.004
But it's grim here.

24:53.005 --> 24:55.003
Better you're somewhere happy.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.480
I love you.

25:00.678 --> 25:02.795
More than anything.

25:02.796 --> 25:05.074
I love you too.

25:12.147 --> 25:13.905
You've eaten already.

25:14.905 --> 25:16.622
I couldn't sleep.

25:16.623 --> 25:18.501
Livvy sends her regards.

25:18.502 --> 25:21.817
Prudence Swanson
is spoiling her rotten.

25:21.818 --> 25:23.537
That's good.

25:24.937 --> 25:26.534
Thank you, son.

25:29.532 --> 25:34.526
I'd like a word with your father,
if I may, uh, alone.

25:34.527 --> 25:36.686
I'm expected at the sheds.
Please!

25:46.436 --> 25:49.912
Oh, George, if you have
something to say, say it.

25:49.913 --> 25:53.289
This petulant avoidance is
simply prolonging the inevitable.

25:53.307 --> 25:55.823
If I said what I really wanted to

25:55.824 --> 25:59.700
it would be the last conversation
we ever had.

26:07.292 --> 26:10.569
Your papa will forget in time.

26:10.570 --> 26:13.127
Pardon?
Your father.

26:13.128 --> 26:14.726
What about him?

26:14.727 --> 26:16.964
Well, that is who
you're thinking about?

26:16.965 --> 26:19.401
In a way.

26:19.402 --> 26:22.598
I don't know.
I've had a strange thought.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.316
What is it?

26:24.318 --> 26:27.114
It just makes sense
of so many things,

26:27.115 --> 26:32.149
but if I say it and I'm wrong
they'll feel so stupid.

26:32.150 --> 26:34.947
I'm off into town!
Need anything?

26:34.949 --> 26:36.785
No, thank you!

26:36.787 --> 26:38.904
I'll see you soon.

26:39.904 --> 26:42.941
Wait. Wait.

26:43.939 --> 26:45.817
Tell me I'm not crazy.

26:45.818 --> 26:48.775
I'm not, am I?

26:48.776 --> 26:52.293
Don't make me ask, please.

26:53.253 --> 26:55.129
Jack?

26:55.130 --> 26:57.448
Yes.

26:59.526 --> 27:01.564
He is.

27:09.717 --> 27:12.075
Well, this is more
than I'd hoped for.

27:14.312 --> 27:16.630
George.

27:17.588 --> 27:19.508
I'm glad I caught you.

27:20.627 --> 27:22.583
I've been thinking
about what you said

27:22.584 --> 27:24.423
and, uh, you're right.

27:24.424 --> 27:26.181
The blame does lie with Mother.

27:26.182 --> 27:28.937
That means more
than you'll ever know.

27:28.939 --> 27:32.175
And I... I would never
keep the children from you.

27:32.176 --> 27:34.814
Thank you.

27:34.815 --> 27:37.571
If not friends, at least not enemies?

27:39.729 --> 27:42.405
Tea?
That's all I came to say.

27:42.406 --> 27:44.564
Nice to see you.

27:44.565 --> 27:48.241
That's a weight off my mind.
Thank you.

27:48.242 --> 27:53.156
It's so isolated here.
I worry about her staying alone.

27:53.157 --> 27:55.074
It's a safe community.

27:55.075 --> 27:59.991
Even so, I feel better knowing
that you're there if required.

28:09.862 --> 28:12.620
You really are earning your salary.

28:13.858 --> 28:16.016
I do not envy you, my dear.
Really, I don't.

28:16.017 --> 28:18.294
All that endless
kicking and wriggling!

28:18.295 --> 28:21.290
It's like a Mexican pinata
being struck from within.

28:21.291 --> 28:23.568
I couldn't wait to
be rid of Andrew. Oh-ho!

28:23.569 --> 28:26.686
Mmm, does that sound ghastly?

28:26.687 --> 28:28.644
You understand, of course.

28:28.645 --> 28:30.442
I'm sure.

28:30.443 --> 28:32.001
Oh.

28:32.002 --> 28:34.039
I've got it!

28:35.199 --> 28:38.076
Swanson residence. Andrew speaking.

28:39.075 --> 28:41.193
The men never understand, of course.

28:41.194 --> 28:43.549
Oh, Andrew's father
was quite cavalier.

28:43.550 --> 28:45.348
I'm sorry?

28:45.349 --> 28:47.186
He was quite cavalier.

28:47.188 --> 28:50.463
I can't imagine why
I expected him to be otherwise.

28:50.464 --> 28:54.819
Oh, I mustn't be
such a dreary cynic.

28:54.820 --> 28:59.297
Oh, your James
is so adorable and so attentive.

29:00.257 --> 29:02.892
You know, it's quite charming,
the way he looks at you.

29:02.893 --> 29:05.610
Ohh!
Oh, my dear.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.289
Ohh!
Oh.

29:11.406 --> 29:13.123
I'm sure it's nothing.

29:13.124 --> 29:14.721
I'll send for an ambulance.

29:14.722 --> 29:17.039
Quicker if I drive.
Oh, darling.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.037
It may be a false alarm
and I don't want to worry anyone.

29:20.038 --> 29:21.516
Oh, if you're certain.

29:21.517 --> 29:25.165
I'll telephone from the hospital
if there's anything to report.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.869
Well done.
There's somewhere I need to go.

29:27.870 --> 29:29.868
But we're expected.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.067
It's on the way.

29:53.648 --> 29:56.763
Dear Heavenly Father,

29:56.764 --> 30:00.162
I don't know
if you're still listening.

30:01.120 --> 30:07.314
But if you are,
please bless the soul of our child.

30:07.315 --> 30:11.750
Take our poor baby into your arms.

30:11.751 --> 30:16.586
Forgive me for what I am about to do.

30:17.745 --> 30:20.343
I know it's wrong,

30:20.344 --> 30:25.339
but it's for James, for our marriage.

30:26.337 --> 30:28.935
Please understand.

30:35.490 --> 30:37.488
Amen.

30:50.146 --> 30:52.464
What is it? What's so urgent?

30:53.502 --> 30:56.181
Two and two's finally
made four, my darling.

31:29.495 --> 31:34.723
I'm here... It's alright.

31:35.206 --> 31:40.658
You're safe now, you're safe.

31:43.650 --> 31:48.245
I'm here.

31:58.411 --> 32:00.649
Rene.

32:19.694 --> 32:23.529
The young woman has gone into labour
so we're going to induce you now.

32:23.530 --> 32:25.129
What's going to happen?

32:25.193 --> 32:27.987
You're going to give birth exactly
as you would to a healthy baby.

32:27.988 --> 32:31.225
And the girl, does she know
where her child is going?

32:31.226 --> 32:33.662
Only that the infant
will find a good home.

32:33.663 --> 32:35.620
She'll be looked after financially.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.017
It is imperative
this remains a secret.

32:38.019 --> 32:41.575
Discretion is as important for us
as it is for you.

32:41.576 --> 32:43.413
Now let's get you
to the labour ward.

32:43.414 --> 32:45.451
I'll telephone James
at the appropriate time.

32:45.452 --> 32:46.891
Thank you.

32:49.489 --> 32:51.087
Thank you for everything.

32:51.088 --> 32:53.644
Now you must be strong, Mrs Bligh.

32:53.645 --> 32:56.842
There's rough water
before we make the harbour.

32:56.843 --> 32:58.161
Good luck.

32:59.399 --> 33:02.438
Don't look when
they take the little one away.

33:05.673 --> 33:08.631
I would have told you straightaway
if it had been just about us.

33:08.632 --> 33:10.668
I know.

33:10.669 --> 33:14.743
Sometimes you have to put other
people's feelings ahead of your own.

33:14.744 --> 33:16.384
Yes.

33:18.502 --> 33:20.420
Go on.

33:21.420 --> 33:24.376
No matter what you feel right now
towards your grandmother,

33:24.377 --> 33:26.014
don't forget you love her

33:26.015 --> 33:28.732
and you always will.

33:28.733 --> 33:32.369
I think I just gave you
my first piece of fatherly advice.

33:32.370 --> 33:33.769
I think you did.

33:37.606 --> 33:39.963
She needed this...

33:41.920 --> 33:44.479
...to help stop her hating.

33:46.796 --> 33:48.356
What?

33:49.754 --> 33:51.831
When we first met, I thought,

33:51.832 --> 33:54.629
"I know exactly
what she sees in him."

33:54.630 --> 33:56.548
You're very handsome.

33:57.507 --> 33:59.744
But you're so much more than that.

33:59.745 --> 34:03.542
I sold you short. You're a fine man.

34:07.338 --> 34:09.096
I'm returning to Sydney.

34:10.695 --> 34:14.330
George came to see me.
He offered an olive leaf.

34:14.331 --> 34:16.329
I'm sure the branch will come,

34:16.330 --> 34:20.246
which, sadly, he seems disinclined
to extend to you.

34:22.324 --> 34:26.757
I'm your only hope, Elizabeth.
You'll see that soon enough.

34:26.759 --> 34:29.158
I'll see you at Anna's wedding.

34:29.159 --> 34:33.793
Oh, that's right -
you're not invited.

34:42.025 --> 34:46.303
Regina informs me you have
softened somewhat towards her.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.299
George?

34:49.300 --> 34:51.656
Oh, for goodness sake,
will you talk to me?

34:51.657 --> 34:53.534
No.

34:53.536 --> 34:55.172
Oh, so you're just going to drown

34:55.174 --> 34:56.891
whatever it is you're feeling
with that?

34:56.893 --> 34:59.689
That will not help you
to forget her.

35:01.529 --> 35:03.765
I'm not drinking to forget her.

35:03.766 --> 35:05.524
Please just leave.

35:05.525 --> 35:07.402
No, not until we've had this out.

35:07.403 --> 35:09.000
Leave!
I'm not going anywhere.

35:09.001 --> 35:11.919
Please!
No!

35:11.920 --> 35:14.315
Do you want to know
why I'm drinking?

35:14.316 --> 35:19.313
I'm drinking because I finally see
who you are and it repulses me.

35:20.271 --> 35:23.668
I'm drinking, Mother,
to drown my hatred for you.

35:23.669 --> 35:26.305
What made you like this?

35:26.306 --> 35:30.022
Did Father not want you?
Did you repulse him as well?

35:30.023 --> 35:32.739
So you poured
all of your misery into us.

35:32.740 --> 35:36.137
A mother sacrifices for...
A mother loves!

35:36.138 --> 35:37.894
She wants joy for her children.

35:37.895 --> 35:40.652
You? You can't bear
to see us make our own choices...

35:40.653 --> 35:42.171
That's not true.

35:42.172 --> 35:43.689
...because if they do make us happy

35:43.690 --> 35:46.247
it simply highlights
what a desperately unhappy life

35:46.248 --> 35:48.207
you've made for yourself.

36:04.232 --> 36:05.831
Pardon.

36:06.737 --> 36:09.723
Some wine?

36:09.726 --> 36:12.624
Oui, merci.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.417
He will improve.

36:21.418 --> 36:24.294
My tears are for you, not him.

36:24.295 --> 36:27.131
This is what I had feared.

36:27.133 --> 36:29.892
You are tied to him now.
There is no hope.

36:35.126 --> 36:39.722
A week ago I thought he was dead.
There's always hope.

36:41.521 --> 36:44.797
You must face the truth.

36:44.798 --> 36:48.634
He will never be the man
you loved. Never.

36:48.635 --> 36:51.670
I won't let you sacrifice
everything out of duty.

36:51.671 --> 36:54.509
It's not duty. It's love.
Is it?

36:55.508 --> 36:57.984
Or the memory of love?

36:57.985 --> 37:03.222
That life, that precious time
with him is gone.

37:05.100 --> 37:08.095
Please, Sarah, I beg you, go home.

37:08.096 --> 37:12.252
Go back to your new love,
to your happiness, to your hope.

37:12.253 --> 37:14.210
Oh...

37:14.211 --> 37:16.688
Oh, my dear friend.

37:22.084 --> 37:25.640
You asked my permission
to return with him.

37:27.720 --> 37:31.915
I give you my permission
to return without.

37:39.708 --> 37:43.623
Nearly there, Mrs Bligh.
Nearly there.

37:43.625 --> 37:45.941
Good girl, good girl. One more push.

37:45.942 --> 37:47.779
And push. One more.

37:47.781 --> 37:49.937
That's it.

37:49.938 --> 37:52.257
Good girl, good girl. There we are.

39:10.497 --> 39:12.775
It's Sarah.

39:15.890 --> 39:18.688
Can you hear me?

39:20.519 --> 39:23.437
Please, Rene. Please.

39:26.433 --> 39:28.832
Hello. James Bligh.

39:29.975 --> 39:33.810
Father!

39:33.811 --> 39:36.490
The baby, it's coming.

39:52.594 --> 39:54.513
I'm sorry. I would
ask you to come, but...

39:54.514 --> 39:56.550
Darling, I understand.

39:58.789 --> 40:01.547
You go with my blessing.

40:20.489 --> 40:23.367
No, no.

40:25.445 --> 40:27.884
I don't know if I can.

40:30.960 --> 40:32.799
It's alright.

40:56.737 --> 40:59.293
It's a boy.

40:59.294 --> 41:01.691
Is... is he...

41:01.692 --> 41:04.970
He's perfect.

41:16.279 --> 41:19.196
Whoa!

41:19.197 --> 41:21.473
To the new Bligh!

41:21.474 --> 41:22.953
Now you're an aunty.

41:30.945 --> 41:32.982
Congratulations, old man.

41:32.983 --> 41:35.141
Oh, my darling.

41:53.245 --> 41:56.122
Your son.

42:40.162 --> 42:42.960
Good morning, my love.

42:57.827 --> 42:59.505
Sarah?
