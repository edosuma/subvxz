01:20.455 --> 01:23.458
<i>Humankind is connected</i>
<i>by a series of intimate experiences</i>

01:23.541 --> 01:24.876
<i>that knit us together.</i>

01:25.418 --> 01:28.338
<i>Nurture these connections</i>
<i>and they become the ties that bind us,</i>

01:28.421 --> 01:29.255
<i>makeus whole.</i>

01:30.131 --> 01:34.302
<i>But is it possible to honor these ties</i>
<i>thatbind and also befree from them?</i>

01:37.263 --> 01:41.226
Noah Harrington
was a star athlete at Lancaster Academy.

01:41.309 --> 01:44.020
But last week,
he was brutally murdered here.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.815
And sources close
to the investigation say,

01:46.898 --> 01:50.902
"What happened in these hallways
was, by all accounts, unnatural."

01:50.985 --> 01:54.197
Do not say a word in this meeting.
I'll do the talking.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.574
Sit and look contrite
because you're contrite, yes?

01:56.658 --> 01:58.493
-Very.
-Okay, be more contrite.

01:58.576 --> 02:01.955
Sooner we get this over with,
sooner we'll be done with this school.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.040
What? It's middle of the semester.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.377
And your semester's over.
We're leaving Savannah.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.462
Before you ask why,
I can list 1000 reasons,

02:09.546 --> 02:11.840
but the only one that matters
is because I said so.

02:14.592 --> 02:17.637
Don't you think it'll look suspicious
if I leave after Noah's death?

02:18.221 --> 02:20.265
No, that's why we're gonna wait
a few weeks.

02:20.348 --> 02:23.560
Your little fling
with that vampire is absolutely over.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.396
You so much as mention her name,
I'll take you both out myself.

02:38.616 --> 02:39.450
Talia.

02:40.201 --> 02:43.872
-What are you doing here?
-I assume we're about to find out.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.585
Good morning, everyone.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.171
Detectives, this way please.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.297
Mrs. Fairmont.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.174
Mrs. Burns.

02:55.133 --> 02:55.967
Please.

03:00.972 --> 03:01.806
Have a seat.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.945
This angle shows Ms. Fairmont

03:16.946 --> 03:20.700
and Ms. Burns in the hallway moments
before Mr. Harrington was murdered.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.827
Are you assuming
my daughter did something?

03:22.911 --> 03:25.830
Preposterous.
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

03:28.875 --> 03:29.792
Is that better?

03:32.295 --> 03:33.379
We have questions.

03:33.463 --> 03:38.092
Well, Juliette won't be answering
any of them until her father is present.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.638
-Sure you know him.
-Ms. Fairmont. No one is under arrest.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.640
Why am I feeling interrogated?

03:44.515 --> 03:47.644
We wanna know
if anyone saw or heard anything useful.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.938
You have no idea who killed that boy.

03:50.021 --> 03:54.275
What we know is Noah Harrington's spine
was ripped from his body. And your girls--

03:54.359 --> 03:57.487
Based on this footage,
you obviously have no idea.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.698
What is this, amateur hour?
What is your badge number?

04:00.782 --> 04:01.616
Mom.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.409
Stop.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.497
I heard screams.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.416
I thought I could help.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.169
When I got there, it was too late.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.880
And you, Calliope?

04:17.715 --> 04:19.592
What did you see or hear in that hallway?

04:24.764 --> 04:25.598
Nothing.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.434
Because I wasn't there.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.236
-Mouth shut.
-Not a word.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.198
No way they believe
we had something to do--

04:42.282 --> 04:44.033
What part of "mouth shut" was unclear?

04:44.617 --> 04:48.079
And just in case you need to be reminded,
you are not to speak another word,

04:48.162 --> 04:51.958
share another glance, take another breath
in the direction of Juliette. You hear me?

04:53.668 --> 04:57.505
I tried to let Noah in,
but Mr. Porter stopped me

04:58.965 --> 05:00.216
and now he's dead.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.969
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.732
-You dropped your ring.
-Thanks.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.155
Wait in the car.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.323
You too, Juliette.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.036
-I'm done.
-As am I.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.121
Why can't you keep your child
away from mine?

05:30.204 --> 05:33.458
-Young love's a powerful thing.
-Calliope's not in love.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.711
-She's hooked like some kind of junkie.
-Talia.

05:39.213 --> 05:40.256
You're right.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.218
We have issues.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.554
Family issues.

05:46.637 --> 05:50.892
Until our families can come
to an agreement we can live or die with--

05:50.975 --> 05:51.934
Yeah, agreed.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.730
-Any suggestions for a location? Hmm.
-My husband's office.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.232
Public enough to be safe,
private enough to--

05:58.316 --> 06:01.527
Prevent everyone
from knowing their DA's a bloodsucker.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.987
-Sure.
-Mm-hm.

06:03.071 --> 06:08.242
Shall we say 1:00? And be a dear
and leave those nasty spear guns at home.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.787
Keep your fangs in your mouth,
we won't have a problem.

06:10.870 --> 06:11.913
Talia.

06:11.996 --> 06:13.790
We will always have a problem.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.965
I remember what it was like.
Afraid to leave our homes,

06:23.049 --> 06:26.469
-then we got rid of them and...
-Yo, Theo, you seeing this?

06:26.552 --> 06:29.263
These soccer moms are starting
their own monster hunting crew.

06:30.014 --> 06:33.851
What are they gonna do when they meet up
with a zombie? Make it a meatloaf?

06:33.935 --> 06:36.437
Plus, this makes me look bad to the Guild.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.232
How am I gonna get promoted
if I can't do what I came to do?

06:40.066 --> 06:43.486
-Not everything is about you, bro.
-Agree to disagree.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.867
Dad said Cook's missing, but the Guild
doesn't want us to look for him.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.037
-Good. That guy was a dick.
-They don't trust us anymore, Apollo.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.248
We lost Uncle Mike and Aunt Sarah.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.794
We haven't done right by them. Or Tess.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.340
-As long as Legacies are stan--
-As long as they're standing,

07:04.424 --> 07:06.217
we need to move smart, not fast.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.303
Thanks to that vampire,

07:09.387 --> 07:12.640
-your sister is now a murder suspect.
-That's not true.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.393
-Cal, sit.
-Murder, huh? Wow.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.438
I'm gonna shut up and listen.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.234
Cal...

07:25.862 --> 07:29.699
I've tried everything to convince you
to stay away from that vamp.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.326
I've forbidden you from seeing her.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.371
I've explained the dangers to our family,

07:35.455 --> 07:41.002
but you still won't stay away from her,
which leads me to believe that you can't.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.629
Mom, I will.
Just don't make me move again.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.007
Everything out of your mouth
just proves my point.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.010
Thank God your father's back.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.096
Time for a severing.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.435
We need to do it as a family.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.987
The mayor and I
are taking all necessary steps

08:08.070 --> 08:10.281
to ensure the safety of our citizens.

08:10.364 --> 08:14.869
I would just ask that people
not make matters worse by panicking.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.371
-I'll take a few questions.
-Sir.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.665
Are you going to reopen
the Ashley Stanton case

08:19.749 --> 08:22.752
to look for connections
to Noah Harrington's murder?

08:22.835 --> 08:25.838
I'm not. No reason
to believe Ashley Stanton's death

08:25.922 --> 08:28.132
was anything but a horrible accident.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.384
Will you be implementing
a monster task force?

08:30.468 --> 08:34.931
I'm confident Savannah's law enforcement
is capable of protecting our citizens.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.266
How? What's your plan
for protecting the city?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.310
Two kids are dead.

08:39.393 --> 08:42.355
That's a tragedy.
Bunny, our kids are best friends.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.316
You know that my daughter
means everything to me.

08:45.399 --> 08:49.237
-Her safety, the safety of--
-Save our kids, kill those monsters.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.656
<i>Save our kids, kill those monsters!</i>

08:51.739 --> 08:54.992
Safety of all of our children
is my number one priority.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.496
<i>Hey, hey, ho, ho, DA Fairmont's got to go!</i>

08:58.579 --> 09:02.416
<i>Hey, hey, ho, ho, DA Fairmont's got to go!</i>

09:02.500 --> 09:06.754
<i>Hey, hey, ho, ho, DA Fairmont's got to go!</i>

09:06.837 --> 09:09.173
<i>-Hey, hey, ho, ho,</i>
-Thank you. Good afternoon.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.050
<i>DA Fairmont's got to go!</i>

09:11.133 --> 09:15.012
<i>Hey, hey, ho, ho, DA Fairmont's got to go!</i>

09:15.096 --> 09:16.389
Well, that went well.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.474
One day, I'm gonna eat that woman.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.769
<i>Hey, hey, ho, ho, DA Fairmont's got to go!</i>

09:23.020 --> 09:24.855
Dad, can we please not do this?

09:25.982 --> 09:29.402
You were bitten by a Legacy.
And we believe you're linked.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.612
Severing is the only way to separate you.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.282
I'm not linked to anything.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.285
Theo, say something.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.037
It'll be all right. It's just--

09:40.121 --> 09:41.038
It's a ritual.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.790
Kind of like a purification.

09:44.500 --> 09:48.170
-This is crazy. I'm not doing it.
-When a vampire bites a human,

09:48.254 --> 09:52.383
it can create a psychic bond between them.
A severing breaks the bond.

09:52.466 --> 09:53.342
Baby girl...

09:54.802 --> 09:56.887
please, sit and listen.

09:59.932 --> 10:00.766
For me.

10:07.565 --> 10:12.111
Hey. I underwent a severing
after my mother was killed

10:12.194 --> 10:13.404
to make sure I wasn't connected

10:13.487 --> 10:16.157
-to the vampire who killed her.
-The vampire who killed your mom

10:16.240 --> 10:18.451
-bit you too?
-We don't know for sure.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.996
But he underwent a severing
just to be safe.

10:22.788 --> 10:27.293
Normally, it's performed under the Guild,
but we can't get to them right now.

10:28.502 --> 10:31.130
Your brother's been trained
and he's gonna perform it.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.300
I don't wanna be severed.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.469
Their bites disappear, Cal.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.095
Their blood paralyzes.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.599
Who knows what is happening inside you?

10:43.392 --> 10:46.604
Time to make sure
you're no longer chained, baby sis.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.576
Elinor, you're hovering.

11:02.203 --> 11:05.748
I wanna talk about this ridiculous truce
with the Burnses.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.125
They tried to eradicate us.
They nearly killed you.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.086
I know. I was there.

11:10.711 --> 11:13.631
Jack Burns put a spear
through my Armani tux.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.342
So how can you sit
across a table from them?

11:16.425 --> 11:18.344
-It's obscene.
-I'm a politician.

11:18.427 --> 11:22.390
-Obscene is 90% of the job.
-Fair enough. But I can't promise

11:22.473 --> 11:25.184
I won't fang out
and drain one of those assholes.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.812
And that is exactly
why you are not invited.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.565
You wanna help? Find Bunny Wheeler.
Remind her that I'm not the enemy.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.442
What a waste of my time.

11:37.655 --> 11:38.489
On it.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.416
We appreciate you
finding the time to meet.

11:54.380 --> 11:58.259
Every time we get together,
a good time is had by all.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.469
Oh, yeah, no argument here.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.180
My husband impaling you
is the highlight of my week.

12:03.264 --> 12:07.476
Okay, let's just assume
we're all exactly where we need to be.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.814
Brass tacks. Twenty-five years
of a monster-free Savannah

12:11.897 --> 12:12.982
was good for us.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.943
Actually, not monster-free.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.279
You're Legacy vampires.

12:19.655 --> 12:20.489
So we are.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.035
We've existed for centuries
because we hide in plain sight.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.205
We live among humans better
than they live among themselves.

12:28.289 --> 12:32.168
Oh, you're impressive.
Is that what you'd like to hear?

12:33.461 --> 12:35.045
Brass tacks.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.298
We're hunters.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.510
Good ones. Last thing we need
is hunters thinking we're soft

12:41.594 --> 12:43.637
-because a raid went sideways.
-Is that--?

12:43.721 --> 12:47.641
We have no interest
in that word traveling, either.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.977
Monsters would think they're safe here

12:50.060 --> 12:52.772
-and the more of them, the more of you.
-More of us, huh?

12:52.855 --> 12:56.400
Then we're on the same page.
Which brings us back

12:56.484 --> 12:59.653
to the elephant in the room.
That high school incident was a shit show,

12:59.737 --> 13:02.782
complete with video evidence
of our daughters' involvement.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.826
The memory card
with the video from the school's camera

13:05.910 --> 13:07.870
may have found its way into my hands.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.290
Trust us with it.

13:12.249 --> 13:14.084
Just a few hours, max.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.837
Our son's a programming whiz.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.007
He can make that video tell
whatever story we need it to tell.

13:20.090 --> 13:23.844
Without anyone realizing they aren't
seeing what they thought they saw?

13:25.262 --> 13:26.180
He's that good.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.264
Huh.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.104
Three hours.

13:34.855 --> 13:38.442
And a commitment
to keep Juliette away from Calliope.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.028
Forever.

13:41.779 --> 13:42.613
At a minimum.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.241
We have a deal.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.577
But we'll never forget the raid.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.620
Neither will we.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.251
To quiet in the town.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.675
-Jack.
-I'm right here.

14:02.758 --> 14:03.968
We're all here, Cal.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.594
Perfect.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.681
Baby, it's gonna be fine.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.059
I love you so much, Calliope.

14:13.269 --> 14:17.106
I pray you can find your way to trust me,
I know I'm doing what's best for you.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.316
I'm scared.

14:21.110 --> 14:24.029
The only thing to be scared of
is what happens if we don't.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.491
You don't want some fanger stuck
in your brain and scrambling your eggs.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.077
-Stop talking.
-I'm just saying.

14:34.957 --> 14:39.169
-Drink this. It's part sedative.
-What's the other part?

14:43.090 --> 14:45.593
Colloidal silver
will enter your body through this tube,

14:46.176 --> 14:47.845
counteract Juliette's venom.

14:49.096 --> 14:49.930
Venom?

14:50.014 --> 14:53.350
Legacies release venom when they bite,
it's part of their binding process.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.979
Since I've been severed,
I have antibodies.

14:57.771 --> 15:00.566
-They'll speed your recovery.
-Will you be okay?

15:02.526 --> 15:04.069
Big brother's always okay.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.033
Ready?

15:34.600 --> 15:37.186
<i>Intra lux, tenebras relego.</i>

15:41.440 --> 15:42.733
It feels really warm.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.401
Relax into it.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.907
Darkness to light, tarnished to purity.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.828
<i>Puriati Studentibus.</i>

15:57.623 --> 15:59.917
Easy. Easy.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.628
-I feel really weird.
-It's okay.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.130
It's okay.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.183
Hang in there, Cal.
You're doing great.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.563
Darkness to light.

16:22.564 --> 16:23.816
Tarnished to purity.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.944
<i>Puriati Studentibus.</i>

16:30.155 --> 16:31.532
Darkness to light.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.158
Tarnished to purity.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.994
<i>Puriati Studentibus.</i>

16:35.077 --> 16:36.912
Nature abhors a vacuum.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.373
-Therefore, we entreat--
-<i>Theo.</i>

16:42.418 --> 16:44.253
<i>Theo!</i>

16:46.380 --> 16:48.132
<i>Theo!</i>

16:49.883 --> 16:50.968
Mom?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.063
Good day.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.775
Who's the best?

17:06.859 --> 17:08.777
Mommy.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.911
Oh, my God,
this is not happening.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.121
What are you doing?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.748
Trying to get your attention.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.089
Mission accomplished.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.472
I can't stay long.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.642
I'm just glad you're here.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.939
<i>-The Secret Garden.</i>

19:51.732 --> 19:53.525
I loved this book when I was little.

19:53.609 --> 19:58.822
Me too. I was convinced
the world was full of places to hide.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.408
Behind every wall was a paradise.

20:04.411 --> 20:07.998
-Lie back.
-You're pushy, you know that?

20:15.172 --> 20:19.176
Whenever I wanna get away, I lay here
and imagine I'm somewhere else.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.053
Where?

20:23.055 --> 20:23.889
I don't know.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.101
I always wanna be wherever I am.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.397
Paris.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.651
And Alaska. And Tokyo.

20:38.904 --> 20:42.741
I know my family's there for a purpose.
And as long as we're successful,

20:43.951 --> 20:44.785
I'm happy.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.747
The way you're confident...

20:50.123 --> 20:52.626
about... who you are

20:52.709 --> 20:55.295
and what your life is supposed to be,

20:56.630 --> 20:58.131
I love that about you.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.468
-I just wish--
-I have to tell you something.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.514
I'm listening.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.937
This thing... between us...

21:14.648 --> 21:15.482
it's over.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.945
You don't wanna be with me?

21:20.821 --> 21:22.781
I had to choose between you and my family.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.325
I choose my family.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.410
What about us?

21:26.493 --> 21:27.494
Cal, I mean...

21:29.079 --> 21:33.792
Maybe while you're here in Savannah,
we're supposed to make you happy.

21:33.875 --> 21:37.421
We're not supposed to be, Jules.
That's the whole point.

21:38.130 --> 21:42.134
Theo performed a ritual to...
sever this hold you have on me.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.472
Then why are you in my dream?

22:29.389 --> 22:31.058
Where did you get those?

22:32.976 --> 22:34.686
I thought they were from you.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.398
Huh. Must be from Mother.

22:39.107 --> 22:42.861
Now and then she does have taste.
They're perfect for tonight.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.447
-Tonight?
-Out.

22:46.573 --> 22:47.407
I'm suspended.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.534
Exactly what gave me the idea.

22:51.036 --> 22:54.581
No school tomorrow. Why waste
the opportunity to have a good time?

22:55.248 --> 22:58.919
You, dear sister,
are in desperate need of an education.

22:59.002 --> 23:01.588
You keep acting
like being a Legacy is such a burden.

23:01.671 --> 23:04.925
All inconvenient bloodlust
and existential angst.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.761
You haven't learned the important part.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.391
-And what's that?
-How fun it can be.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.143
Be ready at 8:00.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.987
-Where's Theo?
-Went to lie down.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.157
-Migraine?
-Probably.

23:30.158 --> 23:30.992
You okay?

23:32.411 --> 23:35.163
Yeah. The severing was weird.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.252
Like, at one point,
it felt like I left my body.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.338
Now that I'm back in it, I feel like crap.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.970
-Could you get me some ice cream, please?
-Can't. Busy.

23:50.053 --> 23:54.558
-What are you all intense about?
-These vigilante monster haters.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.810
This is about to be a real shit show.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.312
Not bigger than
your mess at school, but still.

23:59.396 --> 24:03.817
So you're catfishing bored,
middle-aged hunter wannabes?

24:04.359 --> 24:06.987
Yeah. If the Guild finds out
that MAAM thinks

24:07.070 --> 24:09.823
it could do our job better than we can,
we've got a problem.

24:12.284 --> 24:16.705
Can you please get me some ice cream?
Come on, I told you I don't feel good.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.165
Oh, my gosh.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.002
-Do you want mint chocolate chip?
-Please.

24:37.392 --> 24:40.395
-We're out of mint.
-Vanilla's fine.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.448
I love you,
but don't ask me for anything else.

24:51.531 --> 24:52.449
Love you.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.831
I'm in. They let me in the group.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.669
The woman on the homepage
is Bunny Wheeler, her son's in my class.

25:05.337 --> 25:10.008
Questionnaire asked what's your favorite
libation, I typed in hers. Rosé on ice.

25:10.091 --> 25:14.095
Well, ladies, Apollo Burns is about
to rock your rosé-drinking world.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.931
-You're welcome.
-Yeah.

25:21.895 --> 25:22.896
Good morning.

25:23.563 --> 25:25.065
Good morning, Benny.

25:26.483 --> 25:29.986
-What do you think, son?
-That idea should not be bedazzled.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.532
I would rent a plane and write it
in the sky if I could afford to.

25:34.115 --> 25:37.118
Your first love was murdered
by one of those things.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.745
Think you'd be with the program.

25:39.329 --> 25:43.625
He wasn't my first love. We don't
even know if monsters are really back.

25:44.251 --> 25:47.504
They're back.
The lamestream media just won't cover it.

25:48.088 --> 25:51.216
Not all monsters were violent.
You taught me that.

25:51.967 --> 25:55.262
Seriously. What if you can't tell
the difference between me and like a...

25:56.805 --> 26:00.141
nice vampire girl, for instance.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.477
You get this
through your thick skull, Benjamin.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.354
Monsters are nothing like us.

26:04.437 --> 26:07.274
They feed off our bodies, our fear.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.734
And the members of MAAM
refused to be scared anymore.

26:11.528 --> 26:14.614
Now, how's that Gwyneth Paltrow smoothie?

26:15.615 --> 26:16.575
It's not for me.

26:33.508 --> 26:34.342
Here you go.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.428
Cheers.

26:43.810 --> 26:44.853
Let's dance.

26:45.729 --> 26:46.563
Come on.

27:05.665 --> 27:08.877
Great, now pretend
you don't have a raging UTI.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.615
All right, ladies. Yeah.

27:45.580 --> 27:46.831
I can't feel my face.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.509
Okay, now time for a real drink.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.845
Meet Mark.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.639
Drunk, possibly high,

28:02.722 --> 28:06.351
probably part of a bachelor party
that left him behind.

28:06.434 --> 28:08.978
perfect bait.

28:09.062 --> 28:12.691
-How did you know his name was Mark?
-It's not his real name. Just follow me.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.526
Smile.

28:15.944 --> 28:16.778
Not too big.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.655
Just enough to give a preview.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.135
Move slow, don't look back.

28:42.011 --> 28:43.555
What did you say to him?

28:43.638 --> 28:46.516
Why have a one-night stand
when you can have two?

28:57.360 --> 28:59.696
-Sure you're ready for this, cowboy?
-Yee-haw.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.826
This is your dream come true.

29:05.535 --> 29:07.495
And you won't remember any of it.

29:21.509 --> 29:22.927
Your turn, party girl.

29:25.472 --> 29:27.307
Remember how good your first kill felt?

29:28.767 --> 29:29.726
You've got this.

29:47.994 --> 29:50.246
Wow! What is that?

29:50.330 --> 29:55.001
That is what it feels like to feed off
a guy that did a nice amount of ecstasy.

29:55.084 --> 29:58.046
Elinor, you make me so happy
I feel like my heart's gonna explode.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.633
You're high, sweetie, but thank you.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.971
Hey, wanna play
a drinking game Legacy style?

30:07.597 --> 30:10.517
I take a sip and you take a sip.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.851
-Okay.
-Ready?

30:36.292 --> 30:37.418
How do we know who wins?

30:44.676 --> 30:45.802
Oops.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.221
You win!

30:49.430 --> 30:50.557
Very funny.

31:04.654 --> 31:05.572
He's dead.

31:08.950 --> 31:09.868
You killed him?

31:09.951 --> 31:13.246
We killed him.
I mean, it wasn't intentional.

31:13.329 --> 31:15.373
We were helping you
get your training wheels.

31:19.961 --> 31:20.795
Oh, my God.

31:21.671 --> 31:22.505
Oh, my God.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.552
So, what now? Do we bury him?

31:27.635 --> 31:29.637
Bury him? Are you nuts?

31:30.138 --> 31:32.056
Burials are for amateurs.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.182
Grab his legs.

31:42.525 --> 31:45.528
One, two, three.

31:53.828 --> 31:54.913
How can you smile?

31:56.497 --> 31:57.749
We just killed a guy.

31:57.832 --> 31:59.000
Shh.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.418
This is the best part.

32:10.845 --> 32:13.932
And just like that,
Mark becomes Watermark.

32:14.766 --> 32:15.850
Bye-bye, evidence.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.066
I like keepsakes.

32:24.233 --> 32:27.862
That man has a family,
people who love him.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.657
How will they feel
when they realize he's never coming back?

32:30.740 --> 32:32.825
This is who we are, Jules.

32:33.534 --> 32:36.454
I go out and feed,
our parents go out and feed.

32:37.372 --> 32:41.459
You're gonna have to stop feeling guilty
for doing what you need to do to survive.

32:41.542 --> 32:44.045
You're right. Mom and Dad go out and feed.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.881
That's not what we did tonight.

32:48.758 --> 32:51.678
We don't have to kill to survive.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.034
Ben.

33:58.786 --> 33:59.620
Wheeler.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.295
Seriously, Letty?

34:08.087 --> 34:09.672
-What are you doing?
-Dropping by.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.092
Get in here.

34:22.810 --> 34:23.978
What's up with your hair?

34:26.564 --> 34:32.153
My closeted sort of boyfriend
got eaten by a zombie.

34:33.488 --> 34:34.781
So I'm gay spiraling.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.496
I wanted Harry Styles,
but that didn't make me feel better.

34:41.579 --> 34:44.165
So I went full BTS.

34:48.836 --> 34:51.798
Now, let's see
what your psycho brother has to say.

34:53.299 --> 34:57.553
"I know this decision won't come easy
because you're like me."

34:57.637 --> 34:59.097
Okay, never.

34:59.806 --> 35:03.518
"But you fell for a human.
You have the right to be human too."

35:04.769 --> 35:06.270
What is he talking about?

35:06.813 --> 35:11.192
Oliver says his witch girlfriend
can make me human.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.612
Oh. Fun.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.031
There are witches now?

35:18.241 --> 35:19.075
Apparently.

35:22.328 --> 35:24.497
What if it's my only chance to be normal?

35:40.930 --> 35:42.056
Can I be big spoon?

35:58.114 --> 36:00.158
I want things
to go back to the way they were.

36:02.076 --> 36:04.579
Back to when being a vampire
wasn't all there was to me.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.834
Well... let's think.

36:11.294 --> 36:14.839
If you're not a vampire, then my mom's
group won't be trying to hunt you down.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.467
Yeah, MAAMs.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.427
MAAMs.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.221
I'm thinking
she should back off of the rosé.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.348
Oh, elephant in the room.

36:26.267 --> 36:30.146
The other thing you get if you go human
is the hot human.

36:31.480 --> 36:32.982
You two are still a thing, right?

36:35.067 --> 36:36.527
I think we're more than a thing.

36:37.737 --> 36:38.571
So yes.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.326
If you get a day crawler, what do you got?

36:45.369 --> 36:47.121
Blood? Murder?

36:48.289 --> 36:49.123
Oliver?

36:52.543 --> 36:54.045
What do you have to lose?

36:56.297 --> 36:57.131
I don't know.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.591
My family.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.262
I'm your family too.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.854
Turn around. Big spoon coming through.

37:40.508 --> 37:41.342
There you are.

37:43.135 --> 37:45.346
I fell asleep
waiting for you girls to come home.

37:45.972 --> 37:46.931
Blame Juliette.

37:47.014 --> 37:49.433
She insisted upon dancing the night away.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.936
One party animal in the family is enough.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.355
No more nights out for your sister.

37:54.438 --> 37:57.149
Juliette was supposed
to be on restriction.

37:57.233 --> 38:00.069
Duly noted.
She's kind of a killjoy, anyway.

38:03.698 --> 38:04.782
What's that?

38:05.783 --> 38:09.829
It's customary
for the new Keeper of the Malkia

38:10.538 --> 38:15.876
to present the new
Keeper-in-Waiting with a gift.

38:15.960 --> 38:20.006
Also customary to present said gift
at a coronation ceremony.

38:20.506 --> 38:24.427
Which we can't have since you,
your father, and I are the only ones

38:24.510 --> 38:28.806
who know that
your grandmother is... on vacation.

38:28.889 --> 38:30.599
About that. What's the plan

38:31.267 --> 38:35.271
when Grandmother isn't appearing
at parties and Dad is still molting?

38:35.354 --> 38:38.566
Your grandmother's absence
is only a problem if we allow it to be.

38:41.736 --> 38:45.823
What did you whisper to Dad
before Grandmother saved him?

38:49.368 --> 38:51.287
I told him where he goes, I go.

38:53.789 --> 38:54.665
Sorry...

38:55.791 --> 38:59.587
that you don't get to enjoy your moment
in front of all the other Legacy families.

38:59.670 --> 39:03.632
Darling, real power
isn't about flaunting it

39:04.717 --> 39:07.011
to prove to others that you have it.

39:09.555 --> 39:10.556
Now...

39:27.323 --> 39:30.451
Sometimes real power
is a piece of impressive jewelry.

39:37.958 --> 39:41.087
Since the only goal is real power.

39:42.713 --> 39:45.466
Thank you, Mother. I won't disappoint you.

39:53.265 --> 39:54.141
Ready?

39:54.225 --> 39:55.101
Snow angel.

39:56.435 --> 39:57.895
Tree hug. Thrust.

40:02.691 --> 40:05.403
And drop, stake.

40:06.862 --> 40:09.490
Well, that was titillating.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.867
We just started
teaching the stake part at my gym.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.078
Who's next?

40:17.498 --> 40:20.084
Okay, ladies,
we'll have more Apollo later.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.461
For now, we've got business to attend to.

40:24.380 --> 40:27.383
I've got it. Y'all have serious work here.

40:40.146 --> 40:41.564
What are you doing here?

40:42.523 --> 40:45.609
I'm on assignment,
but apparently, so are you.

40:45.693 --> 40:46.986
Exactly.

40:47.069 --> 40:49.238
So if you could just step aside.

40:49.321 --> 40:52.616
Ah. We were about to plan a trip
to your father's office

40:52.700 --> 40:54.743
and a couple of these ladies have guns.

40:54.827 --> 40:57.705
I'm not saying you can't take them out
before they take you out.

40:58.205 --> 41:01.083
But if the goal is to prove
there are no monsters in Savannah,

41:01.959 --> 41:04.753
kind of hard for a roomful of MAAMs
to suddenly be found dead.

41:06.672 --> 41:09.467
You know I could get past you
if I wanted to.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.344
Yeah, maybe.

41:13.345 --> 41:16.682
But without a plan,
I'm not thinking you want to.

41:16.765 --> 41:18.642
Apollo, who's at the door?

41:24.940 --> 41:26.150
Until we meet again.

41:29.236 --> 41:30.070
Grubhub.

41:31.113 --> 41:32.031
Wrong address.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.755
Fights and climbs.

41:47.838 --> 41:49.173
Impressive.

41:49.256 --> 41:50.466
How did you hear me?

41:52.551 --> 41:54.887
I didn't. But I knew you were here.

41:59.391 --> 42:02.770
Um... You have to invite me in.

42:05.898 --> 42:06.857
You can come in.

42:14.823 --> 42:16.200
You've seen my bedroom.

42:17.576 --> 42:19.203
Only fair that I get to see yours.

42:19.286 --> 42:22.414
In a dream,
I can't believe we're still connected.

42:23.749 --> 42:24.917
I'm just happy we are.

42:33.175 --> 42:34.510
You were a Girl Scout?

42:35.386 --> 42:37.721
Only way to get my parents
to let me use a crossbow.

42:43.852 --> 42:45.062
Are these...

42:46.647 --> 42:47.565
yearbooks?

42:48.691 --> 42:50.317
I keep something from every school.

42:51.694 --> 42:53.112
I'm not in most of them.

42:53.654 --> 42:55.614
We weren't supposed to stand out.

42:56.156 --> 42:57.992
That way no one asks questions
when we're gone.

42:59.243 --> 43:01.495
What's the longest
you've been in one place?

43:02.329 --> 43:03.163
Few months.

43:07.418 --> 43:11.297
Well... maybe you'll break your record
here in Savannah.

43:14.174 --> 43:16.427
We're out of here in a couple weeks.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.722
What, seriously?

43:23.058 --> 43:25.227
You have to find a way to stay.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.279
Is this a dream?

43:36.989 --> 43:38.198
Does it matter?

43:49.501 --> 43:51.337
Shit. Shit, it's not a dream.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.923
My brother said
he needs to talk to me. It's important.

43:55.007 --> 43:57.301
-If I don't go down, he'll come up.
-I'd better go.

43:57.384 --> 43:59.845
No. Stay. I don't want you to go.

44:01.096 --> 44:02.806
I won't be gone long. Okay?

44:10.064 --> 44:10.898
Okay.

44:14.735 --> 44:17.112
-Hey.
-Hey, I need to talk to you.

44:18.072 --> 44:18.906
What's up?

44:20.366 --> 44:22.117
What? What's wrong?

44:23.702 --> 44:24.745
Uh...

44:25.788 --> 44:29.708
This is gonna sound weird,
but during the severing, did you

44:30.876 --> 44:32.336
see any flashes of my childhood?

44:33.379 --> 44:34.296
Your childhood?

44:35.673 --> 44:37.549
No, how could I see your past?

44:38.676 --> 44:43.430
While we were connected, I kind of
got rocked by a vision from my childhood.

44:43.514 --> 44:45.766
-Thought you said it wouldn't affect you.
-I know.

44:47.351 --> 44:48.727
That's what makes it so weird.

44:50.604 --> 44:52.147
Now I'm having dreams too.

44:53.107 --> 44:54.024
About what?

44:54.858 --> 44:55.818
My mom's murder.

44:57.277 --> 45:00.656
They're so real.
It's like I'm back there and I can see.

45:00.739 --> 45:02.866
I can see her holding my hand.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.538
And I could smell the grass.

45:13.919 --> 45:16.255
And I could see bite marks on her neck.

45:18.090 --> 45:19.299
<i>They disappear, Cal.</i>

45:21.218 --> 45:23.595
A vampire bit my mom,
and the bite marks disappeared.

45:25.639 --> 45:29.351
And I remember squinting
so that must mean that it was daylight.

45:29.435 --> 45:31.478
No. No.

45:32.604 --> 45:33.814
-No.
-Yes.

45:33.897 --> 45:37.025
If my mom was killed
by a day-walking vampire, it was a Legacy.

45:37.776 --> 45:40.779
You know how rare Legacies are,
what if it's one of the ones here?

45:40.863 --> 45:42.239
No, I'm sure it wasn't.

45:43.407 --> 45:44.867
That's too coincidental.

45:46.201 --> 45:47.536
But I'm really sorry.

45:49.204 --> 45:52.166
-I hate that you're having these dreams.
-Cal?

45:53.041 --> 45:56.420
-I was looking for you in your bedroom.
-Why were you looking for me there?

45:56.503 --> 45:57.463
I'm here with Theo.

46:00.966 --> 46:02.176
I can see that now.

46:02.718 --> 46:06.013
Your brother said you wanted some
ice cream, I was gonna get you some.

46:06.096 --> 46:08.015
-Unless you wanna come.
-No.

46:08.640 --> 46:09.475
Thanks, Daddy.

46:10.267 --> 46:13.187
Just bring me back some?
Mint chocolate chip?

46:14.438 --> 46:15.272
Got it.

46:32.998 --> 46:35.542
-Hey.
-You're still here?

46:35.626 --> 46:37.961
I heard someone coming down,
I jumped in the closet.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.880
I'm just glad you didn't leave.

46:40.756 --> 46:42.090
Sorry I took so long.

46:43.133 --> 46:43.967
It's okay.

46:45.677 --> 46:49.014
I actually had some time to think
while I was in there...

46:51.099 --> 46:54.144
and I just want to live my life.

46:55.771 --> 46:58.982
I'm not really even sure
what that means for me, but...

47:01.026 --> 47:03.654
I know that I wanna
figure it out for myself.

47:05.948 --> 47:07.658
-What?
-Nothing.

47:07.741 --> 47:08.826
Nothing, I mean...

47:10.327 --> 47:13.288
I love the way
you're talking about your life.

47:14.248 --> 47:15.457
Like it's your life.

47:17.125 --> 47:19.461
Just makes me feel
like I'm supposed to be with you.

47:22.923 --> 47:24.383
I'm supposed to be with you too.

47:53.245 --> 47:56.498
How are we ever going to just... be?

48:02.087 --> 48:07.259
You know, if we really only have a little
time left... I don't wanna sneak around.

48:09.553 --> 48:11.930
Always worried
about our families killing each other.

48:15.809 --> 48:17.311
We've faced everyone.

48:19.146 --> 48:22.149
Monster and human
have tried to come between us.

48:23.692 --> 48:25.485
<i>Life is all about connections.</i>

48:26.528 --> 48:27.362
We got this.

48:28.488 --> 48:30.824
<i>If you nurture them, they get stronger.</i>

48:32.826 --> 48:38.624
<i>But sometimes, severing connections</i>
<i>is the only way for you to get stronger.</i>

48:40.208 --> 48:41.627
<i>The only way to freedom.</i>

48:59.436 --> 49:02.189
Thanks for coming. It really means a lot.

49:02.272 --> 49:06.068
We were just here for Ashley's memorial.
Now my Noah is gone too.

49:08.153 --> 49:10.238
Noah was an athlete,

49:11.406 --> 49:14.326
a wicked chess player,
and a really good friend.

49:14.409 --> 49:16.370
Once, Ben was alone on Christmas.

49:17.579 --> 49:21.541
Noah showed up late to my family's dinner,
so he could wish his buddy a happy...

49:23.919 --> 49:24.753
holiday.

49:27.089 --> 49:29.257
I remember running out
and buying Ben ear pods,

49:29.341 --> 49:31.426
so Noah wouldn't show up empty-handed.

49:31.510 --> 49:32.511
Tiffany.

49:38.767 --> 49:41.061
There you are, naughty girl.

49:42.604 --> 49:46.900
Be smart today.
You're getting a lot of attention now.

49:48.652 --> 49:49.695
Jealousy kills, honey.

49:49.778 --> 49:50.654
Hmm.

50:14.553 --> 50:16.388
Oh, shit.

50:18.473 --> 50:20.142
What the hell?
