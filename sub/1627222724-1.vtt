18:51.250 --> 18:53.541
She stopped breathing
on the way to the hospital.

18:53.625 --> 18:57.583
And when she got here,
she was already in full cardiac arrest.

18:58.750 --> 19:01.458
We tried to revive her, but sadly...

19:02.541 --> 19:03.541
we couldn't.

19:05.583 --> 19:06.625
Thanks, doctor.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.291

Everything all right?

20:49.500 --> 20:50.541
Uh...

20:51.916 --> 20:53.375
I have terrible news.

20:53.458 --> 20:54.958
There's been an accident.

20:57.166 --> 20:58.250
Danielle, uh...

21:01.500 --> 21:02.541
Oh, my God.

21:04.333 --> 21:05.916
Um, is she...?

21:08.333 --> 21:10.458
She died. This morning.

21:12.583 --> 21:14.708
They did everything they could. I'm sorry.

21:22.875 --> 21:23.750
How?

21:24.500 --> 21:27.208
It was a hit-and-run accident.
She was crossing the street.

21:30.125 --> 21:31.625
I'm sorry. Um...

21:33.041 --> 21:35.375
Do you want me to speak with Marcia?

21:35.458 --> 21:36.583
No.

21:36.666 --> 21:38.791
No, no. I'll talk to her.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.000
Oh, my God.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.833
We'll leave as soon

22:19.916 --> 22:22.541

-Did she say anything?

22:23.416 --> 22:24.250
No.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.666
I just held her hand, Segev. I--

22:29.583 --> 22:33.250
-I tried to keep her calm, I really did.
-Excuse me, you're the husband?

22:36.250 --> 22:37.833
Did you find the guy who killed her?

22:38.375 --> 22:40.416
Not yet, sir. It's still in process.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.041
What about security cameras
from the stores? You checked them?

22:43.125 --> 22:44.916
I'm sure we'll get to it. Don't worry.

22:46.250 --> 22:48.166
-What are you doing here?
-[man] Calm down.

22:48.250 --> 22:51.041
What are you doing here
instead of finding the guy who killed her?

22:51.125 --> 22:53.791
Segev. Stop. Leave it.

22:53.875 --> 22:55.791
[Eliana] Segev.
Ella, what are we going to do?

22:55.875 --> 22:58.708
Stop, stop, stop.
I need some air. I'll be right back.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.375
[Tali] Segev!

23:29.166 --> 23:30.166
She's dead.

23:31.208 --> 23:32.500
I know, I heard.

23:34.958 --> 23:36.583
Uncle Avram called me.

23:45.666 --> 23:48.625
-[Segev] The police came.
-They have something?

23:50.125 --> 23:50.958
[Segev] Nothing.

23:52.333 --> 23:55.500
They can't find the driver or his car.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.625
Can't trust them for shit.

23:58.708 --> 24:00.041
The traffic cops?

24:02.041 --> 24:03.791
I need your help with this, okay?

24:03.875 --> 24:07.166
Yeah, sure. I'll check.

24:07.791 --> 24:09.166
I need to get Ella.

24:13.416 --> 24:14.583

24:48.500 --> 24:49.875
[Boaz] My condolences.

24:54.458 --> 24:55.625
So, what do you have?

24:56.375 --> 24:58.958
Uh, we know
there were two people in the vehicle.

24:59.041 --> 25:01.125
Two guys, according to eyewitnesses.

25:01.208 --> 25:04.916
We can see the skid marks that start
from here, all the way over there.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.708
Until there.
But the car hit her way before.

25:07.791 --> 25:09.291
[Tali] Took them a while to stop.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.625
[Boaz] Yeah, I think, uh,

25:10.708 --> 25:13.875
the driver was probably on his phone
or he was texting right before he hit her.

25:13.958 --> 25:15.458
He hit the brakes hard.

25:15.541 --> 25:17.666
But when he realized she died,
he freaked and ran.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.208
We still don't have the license plate,

25:21.291 --> 25:25.375
but I asked the cops to get the footage
from these security cameras up there.

Run the plate.

Play the video.

25:49.458 --> 25:50.791
We got a hit on the plate.

25:50.875 --> 25:53.375
The car is registered
to a company called ShalCorp.

25:53.875 --> 25:56.958
And guess what,
it was reported as stolen today.

25:57.041 --> 25:58.750

35:52.625 --> 35:55.041
-And then this morning, I--
-Segev, we got him.

35:56.166 --> 35:57.625
The guy who hit Dani.

35:58.416 --> 35:59.875
What? Who is it?

36:00.750 --> 36:03.166
-You're not gonna believe it.
-Tell me.

36:03.250 --> 36:06.291
Rami Shalem,
the gangster from the crime family.

36:06.375 --> 36:07.458
What?

36:07.958 --> 36:09.416
We just brought him in.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.500
Rami Shalem?

36:11.000 --> 36:11.833
Rami Shalem?

36:12.708 --> 36:16.041
We put together some photos,
we got an eyewitness.

36:17.291 --> 36:18.333
Rami Shalem...

36:18.416 --> 36:20.583
It looks like it was an accident.

36:21.583 --> 36:24.333
We're gonna charge him
with vehicular manslaughter

36:24.416 --> 36:26.250
and felony hit-and-run.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.583
These are her things.

36:34.291 --> 36:36.250
Her purse and her cell phone.

36:36.333 --> 36:37.458
[door opens]

36:40.416 --> 36:42.125
-Bye, Segev.
-Bye, Moshe.

36:43.250 --> 36:44.333
[Tali] Good night.

36:48.166 --> 36:49.666
[Shira] Elush? You coming?

36:49.750 --> 36:51.791
I want to stay with Dad tonight.

36:57.625 --> 36:58.625
[Shira] Bye, love.

36:59.416 --> 37:00.416
[Segev] Thanks.

37:03.125 --> 37:03.958
[Syd] Bye.

37:10.208 --> 37:11.291
You staying here?

37:12.791 --> 37:14.458
[Shira] Call me if you need anything.

37:15.875 --> 37:17.666
[Segev] Thank you.
I'll drop her off tomorrow.

37:17.750 --> 37:18.833
[Shira] Say hello.

37:21.458 --> 37:22.333
[Segev sighs]

37:23.958 --> 37:27.000
Ella, go to bed. I'll be right up. Okay?

37:27.083 --> 37:28.041
Okay, Dad.

38:12.416 --> 38:13.583
Goddamn it.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.416
What?

38:15.500 --> 38:16.875
I'm out of smokes.

38:18.125 --> 38:19.875
-I'll go get some.
-No, come on.

38:19.958 --> 38:22.166
Two minutes. I'll go to the supermarket.

38:22.250 --> 38:25.541
-You serious right now?
-Stop it. I might even smoke one with you.

38:26.375 --> 38:27.625
Just kidding, kiddo.

38:28.625 --> 38:29.625
[door opens]

38:30.791 --> 38:31.791
[door closes]

38:34.875 --> 38:36.166
[engine starts]

38:42.666 --> 38:44.666
[suspenseful music playing]

38:53.041 --> 38:55.208
[woman] Sir, they're waiting
for you upstairs.

38:55.291 --> 38:56.333
Everybody there?

38:57.500 --> 38:58.791
[cell phone buzzing]

39:18.083 --> 39:19.166
[line beeps]

39:19.250 --> 39:21.250
[indistinct chatter]

39:27.000 --> 39:28.125
[man 1] Give it to me.

39:30.375 --> 39:32.208
-Hey.
-Hi. I'm very good. And you?

39:39.333 --> 39:41.000
He's on his way right now, so...

39:41.750 --> 39:43.958
-[man 2] Hey, how are you?
-Give me a sec.

40:01.708 --> 40:03.541
[Sharon]
Sorry for calling you here so late,

40:03.625 --> 40:05.875
but there's an incident that, uh...

40:07.125 --> 40:08.625
It requires our attention.

40:09.333 --> 40:10.416
Assaf!

40:10.500 --> 40:12.291
Yes. Uh, sorry.

40:14.500 --> 40:15.333
What's it?

40:15.416 --> 40:17.833
8200 have been tracking some calls,

40:17.916 --> 40:21.041
and it appears
we might have a slight problem.

40:21.125 --> 40:23.625
The head of our Intelligence
should be here shortly to, uh,

40:23.708 --> 40:25.083
brief us on the subject.

40:27.875 --> 40:29.166
[line ringing]

40:30.958 --> 40:33.208
-[Tali] It's okay.
-[cell phone buzzing]

40:39.208 --> 40:40.750
[Segev] Someone keeps calling her.

40:45.916 --> 40:48.166
[Assaf] Hey, my love. Is everything okay?

40:48.250 --> 40:49.375
What? Who's there?

40:51.000 --> 40:52.500
Sorry, wrong number.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.083
[line disconnects]

41:02.625 --> 41:04.125
Tali, he said, "My love."

41:05.791 --> 41:07.666
You gotta look up this number for me.

41:09.333 --> 41:12.250
-You sure you want to go there now?
-You already know the answer.

41:14.208 --> 41:15.875
-Look, it's the same number.
-Segev...

41:24.458 --> 41:25.541
What was she up to?

41:32.875 --> 41:34.250
Fine, I'll find it for you.

41:40.500 --> 41:41.500
Fuck.

41:45.416 --> 41:47.458
[woman speaking indistinctly on TV]

41:47.541 --> 41:48.708
[door unlocks]

41:50.916 --> 41:52.333
-Hey, baby.
-[Assaf] Hey.

41:53.791 --> 41:54.666
Come here.

41:57.083 --> 41:58.250
You're hungry?

41:58.333 --> 41:59.666
No, I ate. [sighs]

42:01.041 --> 42:02.375
What's on the news?

42:02.458 --> 42:03.541
Nothing new.

42:04.666 --> 42:07.541
-You wanna cuddle?
-Sure.

42:09.250 --> 42:11.125
There's, uh, wine in the kitchen.

42:12.833 --> 42:14.125
In other news,

42:14.208 --> 42:16.791
Rami Shalem,
notorious for being affiliated

42:16.875 --> 42:20.458
with one of the most dangerous
crime families in Israel,

42:20.541 --> 42:23.333
has been arrested in connection
with a hit-and-run.

42:23.416 --> 42:27.166
The victim was a young woman
from the United States, Danielle Azulai.

42:27.250 --> 42:28.458
I don't believe it.

42:29.083 --> 42:32.083
Azulai, a dancer
from the Batsheva Dance Company,

42:32.166 --> 42:34.125
was struck while crossing the street.

42:34.208 --> 42:36.875
She was rushed to the hospital
where she was pronounced dead.

42:37.500 --> 42:40.250
That's terrible. I know her from dance.

42:40.333 --> 42:41.500
She was nice.

42:41.583 --> 42:43.583
[dramatic music playing]

42:50.083 --> 42:53.333
Well, I'd better call Ohad Naharin.
He'll be devastated.

43:15.250 --> 43:16.916
[Danielle] I'll leave it up to you.

43:18.458 --> 43:20.166
-Goodbye, Ella.
-[Ella] Bye!

43:26.166 --> 43:27.541
Sorry, I'm late.

43:28.208 --> 43:31.125
Just had the most amazing day
at the Jerusalem mountains.

43:31.208 --> 43:33.625
It was... incredible.

43:34.583 --> 43:36.041
I've been here since 5:00.

43:39.166 --> 43:40.750
The tour went a little long.

43:41.666 --> 43:42.666
Sorry, babe.

43:45.208 --> 43:46.625
Who was that dropping you off?

43:48.500 --> 43:51.583
The tour guide
and his 10-year-old daughter.

43:55.833 --> 43:57.708
I don't know if this is working for me.

43:59.041 --> 44:00.833
-What happened?
-Nothing happened.

44:01.333 --> 44:03.708
I just don't have the time
to wait around for you.

44:03.791 --> 44:06.500
My life is very complicated.
You don't seem to understand that.

44:06.583 --> 44:09.666
I do the best I can.
We have different schedules.

44:11.625 --> 44:14.333
-If you don't feel good about us, then...
-Danielle.

44:14.416 --> 44:17.791
My marriage is falling apart,
I'm under tremendous stress at work.

44:18.291 --> 44:21.000
You're the only thing
I feel good about right now.

44:21.083 --> 44:23.291
Then why are we talking like this?

44:25.083 --> 44:27.083
[dramatic music playing]

45:15.375 --> 45:17.375
[ominous music playing]

45:33.166 --> 45:34.500
[clattering]

46:37.833 --> 46:38.833
[door locks]

47:06.333 --> 47:07.625
[man shouting]

47:47.166 --> 47:48.250
Dad?

47:55.750 --> 47:56.791
[bones crack]

48:27.750 --> 48:29.750
[suspenseful music playing]

48:34.583 --> 48:35.666
Abba.

48:35.750 --> 48:36.875
Put your shoes on!

48:37.291 --> 48:39.583
Why, Dad? What's wrong?
Why are you bleeding?

48:39.666 --> 48:43.250
Everything is okay, baby.
Put this on. I'll take you to Mom.

48:43.333 --> 48:44.666
Everything is okay. Come.

48:46.250 --> 48:49.041
Everything is okay.
I'm okay. Come on. Put this on.

48:49.750 --> 48:51.791
Hold on tight. Come. Hold on tight.

48:51.875 --> 48:54.791
Close your eyes. Everything is okay.
Keep your eyes closed.

48:56.041 --> 48:57.083
What's happening?

48:57.458 --> 48:59.333
-Just keep your eyes closed.
-Daddy...

48:59.833 --> 49:00.708
What's...?

49:24.583 --> 49:27.250
-Dad, don't go back there.
-Don't worry. I'll be fine.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.333
Segev, what happened?

49:32.041 --> 49:33.833
I'll call you later, okay?

49:38.166 --> 49:40.250
Hello. Tali, wake up. Yeah.

49:40.333 --> 49:42.000
Meet me up at my house now.

49:48.666 --> 49:49.500
Come on.

49:49.583 --> 49:50.583
Hello?

49:51.625 --> 49:54.666
There was a break-in. He's dead.

49:55.333 --> 49:57.541
Yeah. Segev Azulai.

49:57.625 --> 49:58.791
[in Hebrew] Derech Hazaiyt 30.

49:59.875 --> 50:00.916
[in English] Yes, please hurry.

50:15.791 --> 50:17.791
[ominous music playing]

50:42.625 --> 50:43.708
What the fuck?

50:43.791 --> 50:45.791
[siren approaching]

51:02.791 --> 51:04.791
[theme music playing]
