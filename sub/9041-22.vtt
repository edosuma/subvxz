WEBVTT

00:02.467 --> 00:05.600
- COME ON, GUYS!
NO, NO, NO, BATHS ARE FUN.

00:05.600 --> 00:06.900
YOU LOVE BATHS.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.567
THERE'S WATER.
YOU GET TO BE NAKED, HUH?

00:10.567 --> 00:12.200
- JUMP, GEOFFREY, JUMP!
- NO, ALLY.

00:12.200 --> 00:15.700
LISTEN: THE ONLY REASON
I LET YOU GET OLDER

00:15.700 --> 00:17.200
IS SO YOU COULD HELP ME.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.600
[children laughing
and screaming]

00:18.600 --> 00:20.833
GET OFF THE COUCH.
OFF THE COUCH.

00:20.833 --> 00:24.800
- I TOLD YOU IT MIGHT
BE A LITTLE CRAZY.

00:24.800 --> 00:25.800
HI, DEAR.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.500
- HI, MARIE.

00:27.500 --> 00:30.367
- I JUST BROUGHT
HILDA AND ARTIE OVER

00:30.367 --> 00:31.767
'CAUSE I WANTED THEM

00:31.767 --> 00:34.733
TO SEE THE KIDS DO
THEIR "KNOCK, KNOCK" JOKE.

00:34.733 --> 00:36.533
- WE HEAR IT'S A HOOT!

00:36.533 --> 00:38.233
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
NOW'S NOT THE BEST TIME.

00:38.233 --> 00:39.500
I'M TRYIN' TO GET 'EM UPSTAIRS.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.067
- MICHAEL, "KNOCK, KNOCK"--
- MARIE.

00:41.067 --> 00:43.333
- HONEY, LET MICHAEL
SAY "KNOCK, KNOCK."

00:43.333 --> 00:45.133
- KNOCK, KNOCK!
KNOCK, KNOCK!

00:45.133 --> 00:46.533
- NO "KNOCK, KNOCK" JOKES
RIGHT NOW.

00:46.533 --> 00:47.933
WE'RE GOIN' UPSTAIRS.

00:47.933 --> 00:49.900
- "ORANGE."
DEBRA, SAY "ORANGE."

00:49.900 --> 00:51.333
- MARIE, PLEASE STOP!

00:51.333 --> 00:53.667
WE ARE NOT TELLING
"KNOCK, KNOCK" JOKES RIGHT NOW!

00:53.667 --> 00:55.367
WE ARE GOING UPSTAIRS
FOR OUR BATHS.

00:55.367 --> 00:57.167
ALL RIGHT? THANK YOU.

00:57.167 --> 01:00.633
LET'S GO.

01:00.633 --> 01:03.100
COME ON.

01:19.033 --> 01:21.167
- WELL.

01:25.967 --> 01:28.100
- HELLO, RAYMOND, DEAR.

01:28.100 --> 01:31.300
I JUST DROPPED BY
TO PICK UP MY BIG SPOON.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.967
ARE YOU FINISHED WITH IT?

01:33.967 --> 01:35.467
- ME?

01:35.467 --> 01:37.633
- I WAS THE ONE THAT BORROWED
IT, REMEMBER, MARIE?

01:37.633 --> 01:39.200
- IF YOU'RE NOT DONE
WITH IT, RAYMOND,

01:39.200 --> 01:43.400
I COULD COME BACK.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.300
- MA, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
- NOTHING...

01:45.300 --> 01:49.167
I'M MAKING SAUCE,
AND I JUST WANTED MY BIG SPOON.

01:49.167 --> 01:52.133
- YEAH? SO ASK DEBRA.

01:56.567 --> 02:01.600
- UM, I--I'M FINISHED WITH IT,
MARIE, SO...

02:01.600 --> 02:03.033
HERE.

02:16.967 --> 02:19.267
- THANK YOU, RAYMOND.
BYE-BYE.

02:26.300 --> 02:27.833
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:27.833 --> 02:29.067
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

02:29.067 --> 02:33.733
YOU TWO HAVE
A LITTLE...ROWDY-DOW?

02:33.733 --> 02:34.967
- NO.

02:34.967 --> 02:36.633
THAT LAST TIME I SAW HER
WAS YESTERDAY

02:36.633 --> 02:38.633
WHEN SHE JUST DROPPED BY
WITH HILDA AND ARTIE,

02:38.633 --> 02:40.667
AND I WAS TRYING
TO GET THE KIDS UPSTAIRS.

02:40.667 --> 02:43.433
- YEAH?
- WHAT?

02:43.433 --> 02:45.700
SHE WANTED TO HEAR THE TWINS
TELL THEIR "KNOCK, KNOCK" JOKE,

02:45.700 --> 02:47.233
AND I TOLD HER
IT WAS A BAD TIME,

02:47.233 --> 02:48.667
AND WE WENT UPSTAIRS.

02:48.667 --> 02:51.467
- DID THEY DO THE GOLIATH ONE?
- NO, I--

02:51.467 --> 02:53.433
- 'CAUSE THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
KNOCK, KNOCK.

02:53.433 --> 02:55.000
SAY "WHO'S THERE?"

02:55.000 --> 02:57.200
- WHAT IS WITH YOUR FAMILY?

02:57.200 --> 02:59.133
- COME ON.

02:59.133 --> 03:01.233
SAY "WHO'S THERE?"
- WHO'S THERE?

03:01.233 --> 03:02.933
- GOLIATH.
- GOLIATH WHO?

03:02.933 --> 03:05.233
- GOLIATH DOWN.
YOU LOOKETH TIRED.

03:14.333 --> 03:17.533
- YOU'RE WONDERFUL.

03:17.533 --> 03:19.667
I MEAN, THAT COULDN'T BE
WHY SHE'S MAD AT ME,

03:19.667 --> 03:21.633
BECAUSE I TOLD HER
IT WAS A BAD TIME?

03:21.633 --> 03:24.233
SHE COULDN'T BE MAD
ABOUT THAT, COULD SHE?

03:24.233 --> 03:25.967
- I THINK IT'S CUTE

03:25.967 --> 03:29.267
HOW YOU'RE STILL
A LITTLE NAIVE.

03:29.267 --> 03:30.400
- OH, MY GOD.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.833
I MEAN, GOD,
SHE'S A LUNATIC!

03:31.833 --> 03:33.633
- SO WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
LET HER HEAR THE JOKE?

03:33.633 --> 03:35.300
IT ONLY TAKES
LIKE TWO SECONDS.

03:35.300 --> 03:37.133
HERE, LET'S DO GOLIATH AGAIN.
KNOCK, KNOCK--

03:37.133 --> 03:40.067
- THAT IS NOT THE POINT, OKAY?

03:40.067 --> 03:41.700
- THINGS HAVE TO SCREECH
TO A HALT

03:41.700 --> 03:44.033
BECAUSE MARIE'S GONNA WALTZ
OVER HERE WITH HER FRIENDS

03:44.033 --> 03:47.800
TO PUT ON THE "GRANDMA SHOW"?

03:47.800 --> 03:49.300
- YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:49.300 --> 03:53.333
YOU SHOULD GO OVER
AND APOLOGIZE.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.500
- WHAT?

03:54.500 --> 03:56.900
ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU'RE TAKING HER SIDE?

03:56.900 --> 04:01.533
- I'M NOT TAKING ANY SIDE.
IT'S TOO SMALL TO HAVE SIDES.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.733
- NO, I LET SO MUCH GO
WITH HER, RAY.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.933
I MEAN, I'M ALWAYS
LETTING THINGS ROLL OFF MY BACK.

04:06.933 --> 04:08.633
THE WOMAN RUINS MY LIFE,

04:08.633 --> 04:11.133
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO PRETEND
EVERYTHING IS FINE AND DANDY.

04:11.133 --> 04:12.900
- WELL, YOUR LIFE ISN'T RUINED,

04:12.900 --> 04:15.033
EVERYTHING IS FINE AND DANDY.

04:15.033 --> 04:16.700
- I AM NOT APOLOGIZING FOR THIS.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.200
YOUR MOTHER IS
ACTING LIKE A CHILD,

04:18.200 --> 04:19.633
GIVING ME THE SILENT TREATMENT.

04:19.633 --> 04:21.933
DO YOU REALIZE HOW
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE THAT IS?

04:21.933 --> 04:23.300
- BUT--BUT--

04:23.300 --> 04:24.867
- NO, SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO TALK TO ME,

04:24.867 --> 04:26.767
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO--
THAT'S FINE AND DANDY.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.333
- SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA POUT
AND GO, "SHE STARTED IT"?

04:29.333 --> 04:31.167
I THINK THAT'S
A LITTLE PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.

04:31.167 --> 04:32.633
- OH, YEAH?

04:32.633 --> 04:34.767
- WHICH I STILL PREFER
TO AGGRESSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.

04:38.367 --> 04:39.633
- SO...

04:39.633 --> 04:40.933
HOW ARE THINGS?

04:40.933 --> 04:42.267
- YEAH, FINE.

04:42.267 --> 04:43.833
- THAT'S NICE.

04:43.833 --> 04:45.300
AND HOW'S DEBRA?

04:45.300 --> 04:48.300
- MA--HA, OKAY, I SEE.

04:48.300 --> 04:49.767
YOU LURED ME OVER WITH CAKE

04:49.767 --> 04:52.667
SO YOU COULD PUMP ME
FOR INFORMATION ABOUT DEBRA.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.833
- AND FEED YOU CAKE.

04:54.833 --> 04:57.900
- FEED ME CAKE.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.367
- RAYMOND, I WAS JUST WONDERING

04:59.367 --> 05:01.600
IF DEBRA PICKED UP
ON MY LITTLE SIGNAL YESTERDAY.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.033
- WHAT, WHEN YOU GAVE HER
THE SILENT TREATMENT?

05:04.033 --> 05:07.633
- OH, GOOD.
YOU NOTICED IT TOO.

05:07.633 --> 05:10.933
I WAS WORRIED THAT
I MAYBE WAS TOO...SUBTLE.

05:10.933 --> 05:13.267
- YEAH, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM--
TOO SUBTLE.

05:20.167 --> 05:21.500
- EAT YOUR CAKE.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.733
HOW DID DEBRA REACT?

05:33.733 --> 05:35.467
- I DON'T KNOW, MA,
I DON'T WANT TO--

05:35.467 --> 05:37.467
- JUST STAY OUT OF IT, RAY.
- I AM, DAD.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.600
- FRANK, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.733
- THAT'S RIGHT,
BECAUSE I STAY OUT OF IT.

05:42.733 --> 05:47.200
- THE FACT IS THAT YOUR WIFE
HAPPENED TO BE RUDE.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.533
SHE HUMILIATED ME,

05:48.533 --> 05:49.967
AND WHAT'S WORSE,
IT WAS IN FRONT

05:49.967 --> 05:52.367
OF MY DEAR FRIENDS
HILDA AND ARTIE.

05:52.367 --> 05:53.800
- YOU DON'T LIKE
HILDA AND ARTIE.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.067
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

05:56.067 --> 05:57.833
I MEAN, HILDA
HAD JUST BEEN TELLING ME

05:57.833 --> 06:00.567
ABOUT HOW CLOSE SHE IS
WITH HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW,

06:00.567 --> 06:02.867
AND THAT FOR MOTHER'S DAY
THIS WEEKEND

06:02.867 --> 06:06.300
THEY WERE GOING TO A SPA
TO HAVE MASSAGES TOGETHER,

06:06.300 --> 06:09.500
WITH STEAM BATHS
AND BODY LOTIONS.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.633
- HEY, I'M EATIN' HERE!

06:17.667 --> 06:22.000
- AND MY OWN DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
CAN'T TOLERATE ME IN HER HOUSE

06:22.000 --> 06:23.300
FOR A "KNOCK, KNOCK" JOKE.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.233
I FIND THAT CRUEL.

06:25.233 --> 06:27.900
- LOOK, MA, DEBRA'S SORRY, OKAY?

06:27.900 --> 06:30.067
- SHE IS?

06:30.067 --> 06:33.833
REALLY?

06:33.833 --> 06:36.867
- Y-YEAH. YES.

06:36.867 --> 06:40.100
I MEAN, SHE JUST HAS A HARD TIME
SAYING IT, THAT'S ALL.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.733
AND AREN'T YOU THE MATURE ONE?

06:42.733 --> 06:45.233
- THAT'S TRUE.

06:45.233 --> 06:47.533
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MATURE.

06:47.533 --> 06:50.167
- SHE'S AS MATURE AS THE HILLS.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.900
- ALL I'M SAYIN' IS,

06:56.900 --> 07:00.667
WHAT IF YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO WENT OVER AND APOLOGIZED?

07:00.667 --> 07:03.433
LET ME FINISH.

07:03.433 --> 07:06.900
WHAT IF YOU APOLOGIZED,
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE MATURE,

07:06.900 --> 07:09.600
REASONABLE, RESPONSIBLE,

07:09.600 --> 07:13.233
BEAUTIFUL ONE?

07:13.233 --> 07:15.500
- YOU'RE SUGGESTING I APOLOGIZE?

07:15.500 --> 07:16.900
ME?

07:16.900 --> 07:19.000
- YES.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
BECAUSE YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.800
- SHAME ON YOU, RAYMOND.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.267
- MA! AWW.

07:32.267 --> 07:35.233
- GUESS WHICH WORD
YOU LOST ME ON?

07:45.333 --> 07:48.333
- HEY, IS THAT LAST COOKIE
MINE OR YOURS?

07:48.333 --> 07:50.600
- I DON'T KNOW.
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.367
- 'CAUSE I THINK IT'S MINE.

07:53.367 --> 07:55.567
- OKAY, FINE.
GO AHEAD.

07:55.567 --> 07:58.467
- NO, NOT "GO AHEAD"
LIKE YOU'RE GIVIN' IT TO ME,

07:58.467 --> 08:00.967
BECAUSE I THINK
IT REALLY IS MINE.

08:00.967 --> 08:06.300
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:06.300 --> 08:07.800
- I DON'T CARE,
I'M GETTIN' IT!

08:07.800 --> 08:09.767
GIVE ME THAT COOKIE!

08:09.767 --> 08:12.700
[laughter]

08:21.233 --> 08:22.700
COME ON, DEBRA!

08:30.800 --> 08:32.767
- DEBRA, MAY I TALK TO YOU?

08:32.767 --> 08:35.400
- SURE, MARIE.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.133
- WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY
HAS REALLY WEIGHED ON ME...

08:39.133 --> 08:42.500
AND I DID SOME SERIOUS THINKING.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.400
SO, DEBRA...

08:44.400 --> 08:47.633
I WAS WRONG.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

08:47.633 --> 08:50.800
- OH, WOW.
MARIE, THANK YOU.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.567
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE,
I'M FINE, REALLY.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.600
- NO, NO, NO, DEBRA,
I WANT TO.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.667
FIRST OF ALL, I'M SORRY
I CAME OVER WHEN I DID.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.667
I SHOULD KNOW BY NOW,
BY LATE AFTERNOON

09:00.667 --> 09:04.100
YOU'VE LOST COMPLETE CONTROL
OF THE KIDS.

09:08.767 --> 09:11.367
AND THEN, I BROUGHT COMPANY,

09:11.367 --> 09:12.700
WHICH MUST HAVE
EMBARRASSED YOU,

09:12.700 --> 09:17.600
SINCE OBVIOUSLY
YOU HADN'T TIDIED UP.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.800
SO I UNDERSTAND

09:18.800 --> 09:24.333
WHY YOU FELT THE NEED
TO SNAP AT ME SO.

09:24.333 --> 09:28.133
FOR ALL THAT, I'M SORRY.

09:28.133 --> 09:30.500
ALL RIGHT?

09:42.933 --> 09:45.267
- SO...

09:45.267 --> 09:49.567
SHE'S TALKIN' TO YOU AGAIN!

09:49.567 --> 09:51.567
- WELL, SHE CAN DO
WHATEVER SHE WANTS,

09:51.567 --> 09:54.500
BECAUSE I'M DONE TALKING TO HER.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.733
- THIS IS WHAT I GET
FOR TRYING TO BE NICE.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.067
- COME ON, GUYS.

10:16.067 --> 10:18.600
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING ME
MAKE A NICE MOMMY'S DAY BRUNCH

10:18.600 --> 10:20.767
TO MAKE MOMMY NICE AGAIN,
ALL RIGHT?

10:20.767 --> 10:23.400
SO COME ON, HUH? PLEASE!

10:23.400 --> 10:24.700
LET'S NOT BUST DADDY'S HUMP.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.167
I'VE BEEN GETTIN'
ENOUGH OF THAT.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.033
HEY, MOMMY IS HERE!

10:28.033 --> 10:29.867
HEY, HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!
HI, MOMMY!

10:29.867 --> 10:32.433
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE UPSTAIRS
WAITIN' FOR BREAKFAST IN BED--

10:32.433 --> 10:33.533
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' DOWN HERE?

10:33.533 --> 10:36.533
- I SMELLED SOMETHING BURNING.

10:36.533 --> 10:38.300
- IT'S ALL UNDER CONTROL, OKAY?

10:38.300 --> 10:41.800
SO GO BACK UPSTAIRS
AND GET PSYCHED FOR TOAST!

10:41.800 --> 10:43.067
- LISTEN, RAY,

10:43.067 --> 10:44.467
I'VE BEEN UP THERE
FOR TWO HOURS.

10:44.467 --> 10:48.433
CAN WE JUST
GO OUT TO BREAKFAST, OR...

10:48.433 --> 10:50.067
OR LUNCH?

10:50.067 --> 10:51.467
- WELL, LISTEN,

10:51.467 --> 10:53.267
IF SOME PEOPLE
WERE TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE,

10:53.267 --> 10:55.000
WE COULD BE AT
OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSE RIGHT NOW

10:55.000 --> 10:59.933
HAVING OUR ANNUAL VERY NICE--
NOT CRANKY--MOTHER'S DAY BRUNCH.

10:59.933 --> 11:03.300
- I THOUGHT
ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS

11:03.300 --> 11:06.867
FOR A HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY
WAS A HAPPY MOTHER.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.700
- LISTEN, ALL I--
ding!

11:08.700 --> 11:09.967
TOAST IS HERE!

11:09.967 --> 11:11.833
HEY, GUYS, WHO WANTS TO
GIVE MOMMY BREAKFAST IN BED?

11:11.833 --> 11:13.233
- I DO!
- I DO!

11:13.233 --> 11:16.700
- OKAY, HERE YOU GO.
COME ON, HERE YOU GO.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.033
TAKE THAT.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.800
OKAY, LET'S GO,
COME ON, HURRY UP.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.500
EVERYBODY UPSTAIRS WITH MOMMY!

11:27.500 --> 11:28.733
- RAY--

11:28.733 --> 11:31.400
- AW, OH, AREN'T THEY ADORABLE?
LOOK AT THEM!

11:31.400 --> 11:34.233
- LET'S GO, MOMMY.

11:34.233 --> 11:37.667
- ENJOY YOUR FIRST COURSE.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.567
- HEY, WHAT--

11:57.567 --> 11:59.500
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
WHY AREN'T YOU WITH MOM?

11:59.500 --> 12:02.633
EVIDENTLY, IT'S SIMPLY NOT
MOTHER'S DAY WITHOUT RAYMOND.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.167
- SHE'S BEEN A MISERABLE WRETCH
ALL WEEK LONG.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.033
I MEAN, ON TOP OF THE USUAL.

12:17.033 --> 12:18.967
- HOW'S IT GOIN' OVER HERE?

12:18.967 --> 12:21.500
- YEAH, WELL, IT'S NOT GOOD.
SHE'S IN A BAD MOOD TOO.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.000
I'M JUST GONNA RUN THESE OVER
AND DROP THEM OFF FOR MOM.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.200
- "DROP THESE OFF"?

12:25.200 --> 12:27.033
YOU'LL NEVER GET OUT OF THERE!

12:27.033 --> 12:32.200
SHE'S GOT YOUR BABY BOOK OUT,
AND SHE'S HUMMING LULLABIES.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.500
SHE SENT US OVER TO GET YOU.

12:35.500 --> 12:40.567
- WHAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW IS,
WE'RE NEVER GOING BACK.

12:40.567 --> 12:43.300
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, KEEP IT DOWN.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.100
SHE CAN SENSE HAPPINESS.

12:50.733 --> 12:52.767
- I DON'T LIKE THEM
NOT TALKING TO EACH OTHER.

12:52.767 --> 12:56.100
IT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

12:56.100 --> 12:59.000
- IT'S LIKE IN KOREA...

12:59.000 --> 13:02.900
IT WAS MOST SCARY
WHEN IT WAS QUIET.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.567
- I HATE SEEING THEM LIKE THIS.
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

13:05.567 --> 13:06.600
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:06.600 --> 13:08.733
THE THREE OF US
SHOULD GO TO FLORIDA.

13:14.700 --> 13:17.400
- JUST WHAT EVERY MOTHER
WANTS TO DO ON MOTHER'S DAY--

13:17.400 --> 13:19.600
WASH THE BUTTER
OUT OF HER SHEETS.

13:27.167 --> 13:28.400
- WHAT YOU ARE DOIN', MA?

13:28.400 --> 13:29.800
- HELLO.

13:29.800 --> 13:35.800
I WAS JUST FLIPPING THROUGH
YOUR BABY BOOKS...

13:35.800 --> 13:39.000
RECALLING THE AGONY
OF YOUR DELIVERY.

13:43.333 --> 13:44.600
AND I WAS WONDERING

13:44.600 --> 13:46.967
IF I WAS GOING TO GET
A VISIT FROM YOU

13:46.967 --> 13:49.033
ON MOTHER'S DAY.

13:49.033 --> 13:50.900
- YEAH, OF COURSE, MA,

13:50.900 --> 13:52.867
I'M TAKIN' CARE OF A FEW THINGS
HERE, THAT'S ALL.

13:52.867 --> 13:55.667
- WELL, OF COURSE.
BY ALL MEANS, TAKE YOUR TIME.

13:55.667 --> 13:58.567
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE
OTHER PRIORITIES--

13:58.567 --> 14:02.067
ON MOTHER'S DAY.

14:02.067 --> 14:04.733
- HERE YOU GO, MA.
THERE ARE FOR YOU.

14:04.733 --> 14:06.900
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

14:06.900 --> 14:08.667
- HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY.

14:08.667 --> 14:11.933
- OH!

14:11.933 --> 14:14.100
THEY'RE LOVELY!

14:14.100 --> 14:15.267
THANK YOU, DEAR.

14:15.267 --> 14:17.167
- OKAY, LISTEN, RAY, I--

14:32.600 --> 14:34.400
- KOREA.

14:42.333 --> 14:44.600
- OKAY, WELL, I'M GOING BACK
ACROSS THE STREET.

14:44.600 --> 14:49.800
WHO'S COMING WITH ME?
- OW!

14:49.800 --> 14:53.533
I'LL GO WITH YOU, MA.

14:53.533 --> 14:56.400
- ANYONE ELSE?

14:56.400 --> 14:58.233
- SHE AIN'T MY MOTHER.

15:10.467 --> 15:15.000
- GO AHEAD, RAY.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.600
- RAYMOND?

15:16.600 --> 15:18.933
- LOOK, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO CHOOSE, OKAY?

15:18.933 --> 15:20.800
THIS IS NOT MY FIGHT!

15:20.800 --> 15:23.600
CAN'T YOU TWO JUST
START TALKIN' ALREADY?

15:23.600 --> 15:26.533
COME ON, IT'S MOTHER'S DAY!

15:26.533 --> 15:29.367
CAN'T ONE OF YOU TWO MOTHERS
JUST SAY SOMETHIN'?

15:38.533 --> 15:41.933
DAD, PLEASE,
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT HERE?

15:41.933 --> 15:43.467
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME?

15:43.467 --> 15:45.167
MAYBE DEBRA WILL
COME AROUND AT SOME POINT,

15:45.167 --> 15:49.067
BUT WE'LL NEVER GET ANYTHING OUT
OF OLD SITTING BULL OVER THERE.

15:52.133 --> 15:54.267
- DEBRA, PLEASE,
COME ON, ALL RIGHT?

15:54.267 --> 15:57.367
JUST DO IT FOR ME.

15:57.367 --> 15:59.500
GREAT. GREAT, GREAT.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.367
YOU SEE? YOU SEE?
HERE'S THE PROBLEM, OKAY?

16:01.367 --> 16:02.733
YOU THINK IT'S JUST HER.

16:02.733 --> 16:04.400
WELL, I'M GONNA SAY IT--

16:04.400 --> 16:07.000
WE ALL KNOW THAT IF MY WIFE
WASN'T SO SNIPPY ALL THE TIME--

16:07.000 --> 16:08.200
YES, I SAID SNIPPY--

16:08.200 --> 16:10.567
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED!

16:15.967 --> 16:17.433
- YOU'D BE SNIPPY TOO

16:17.433 --> 16:19.533
IF THIS ONE WAS YAMMERIN' AT YOU
ALL DAY LONG!

16:19.533 --> 16:21.500
YOU GOT NOTHIN'
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.167
- HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE
BEEN GOIN' THROUGH OVER HERE?

16:23.167 --> 16:24.733
I ACTUALLY HAVE
TO LIVE WITH HER,

16:24.733 --> 16:26.333
SO DON'T START WITH ME,
'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW

16:26.333 --> 16:27.667
WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT.

16:38.367 --> 16:39.633
- WOW.

16:47.967 --> 16:50.033
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHIN', PAL.

16:50.033 --> 16:52.567
WHAT HAVE YOU HAD, A TOUGH WEEK?

16:52.567 --> 16:54.233
WELL, I'VE BEEN
LIVING WITH YOUR MOTHER

16:54.233 --> 16:56.600
SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN!

16:56.600 --> 16:59.533
- DEBRA WOULDN'T LET THE TWINS
TELL A "KNOCK, KNOCK" JOKE!

16:59.533 --> 17:02.333
- SHE'S RIGHT!
"KNOCK, KNOCK" JOKES STINK!

17:02.333 --> 17:04.067
- LOOK, THAT'S NOT THE POINT!

17:04.067 --> 17:06.467
MA CAME OVER WITH HER FRIENDS
TO SHOW HOW CUTE THE TWINS ARE

17:06.467 --> 17:08.000
TELLIN' A "KNOCK, KNOCK" JOKE,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.267
AND DEBRA COULDN'T EVEN
GIVE HER THAT LITTLE OF JOY!

17:10.267 --> 17:12.167
- WELL, WHO THE HELL IS MARIE
TO COME BARGING IN,

17:12.167 --> 17:13.633
DEMANDING JOY,

17:13.633 --> 17:15.567
WHEN DEBRA'S WRESTLING
WITH THE DAMN KIDS?

17:15.567 --> 17:17.367
- SHE DIDN'T HAVE
TO BE SO RUDE!

17:17.367 --> 17:20.033
- RUDE IT THE ONLY THING
THAT GETS THROUGH TO HER!

17:20.033 --> 17:22.733
HOW DO YOU THINK
I GOT THE WAY I AM?

17:22.733 --> 17:25.533
I USED TO BE A GENTLEMAN!

17:31.400 --> 17:33.100
- NEVER!
YOU WERE NEVER A GENTLEMAN!

17:33.100 --> 17:35.833
YOU NEVER GAVE MOM ANY RESPECT!
YOU'RE JUST AS BAD AS DEBRA!

17:35.833 --> 17:37.633
- THAT'S A FINE WAY
TO TALK TO YOUR FATHER!

17:37.633 --> 17:39.367
- YOU DON'T LIKE IT?
I DON'T TALK TO YOU AT ALL!

17:39.367 --> 17:41.067
- I DON'T TALK
TO YOU AT ALL!

17:41.067 --> 17:43.033
- HOLD IT! HOLD IT!
[both shouting]

17:43.033 --> 17:44.033
SIT DOWN!

17:44.033 --> 17:45.833
- YEAH, I WILL SIT DOWN!

17:45.833 --> 17:47.467
- FINE!

17:54.633 --> 17:56.833
- LOOK WHAT YOUR FIGHT
IS DOING TO THE FAMILY!

17:56.833 --> 18:01.833
IT'S MOTHER'S DAY,
AND YOU'RE RUINING IT.

18:01.833 --> 18:04.433
THIS DAY IS SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR APPRECIATING EACH OTHER,

18:04.433 --> 18:07.500
NOT SHUTTING EACH OTHER OUT.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.333
WE SHOULD NOT BE
WALLOWING IN HATE,

18:09.333 --> 18:12.000
WE SHOULD BE WALLOWING
IN A BEAUTIFUL BRUNCH

18:12.000 --> 18:14.600
OF BELGIAN WAFFLES AND BERRIES

18:14.600 --> 18:18.733
AND SAUSAGES
OF BOTH LINK AND PATTY!

18:28.700 --> 18:30.867
NOW, I KNOW
WHEN WE'RE ANGRY AND HURT,

18:30.867 --> 18:34.400
WE CAN ONLY SEE THE NEGATIVE
IN THE OTHER PERSON.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.467
BUT YOU TWO PEOPLE
KNOW DEEP DOWN

18:37.467 --> 18:39.967
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER,

18:39.967 --> 18:41.800
HOW YOU CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER,

18:41.800 --> 18:44.067
AND HOW MUCH...

18:44.067 --> 18:46.200
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE EACH OTHER.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.633
- I'M SORRY, RAY.
- ME TOO, DAD.

18:53.633 --> 18:57.800
- NOT YOU GUYS!

18:57.800 --> 19:00.200
- YEAH.
- YEAH, YEAH.

19:00.200 --> 19:03.033
- YEAH, COME ON,
HOW ABOUT IT, DEBRA?

19:03.033 --> 19:05.500
- YEAH, WHAT DO YOU SAY, MARIE?

19:05.500 --> 19:07.133
CAN WE EAT?

19:32.500 --> 19:35.500
- WHY IS THERE BUTTER
ON YOUR SHEETS?

19:53.800 --> 19:55.367
- OH, MY GOD.

19:55.367 --> 19:59.300
- HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY.

19:59.300 --> 20:02.000
THERE WAS ONLY ONE
BIGGER BOUQUET IN THE STORE,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
BUT IT WAS FOR DEAD PEOPLE.

20:07.667 --> 20:11.367
- THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, RAY.
THANK YOU.

20:11.367 --> 20:16.333
- LISTEN, YOU DESERVE THEM.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.200
I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID
ABOUT YOU,

20:18.200 --> 20:19.900
ABOUT YOU BEING SNIPPY AND ALL.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.567
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

20:21.567 --> 20:24.000
- I'M SORRY I WAS SNIPPY TO YOU.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.100
- YEAH?

20:26.100 --> 20:28.700
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:28.700 --> 20:31.733
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE END THIS,
HUH?

20:31.733 --> 20:34.333
LET'S PUSH SPEED DIAL
NUMBER ONE,

20:34.333 --> 20:38.333
AND JUST TELL HER
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, FROM YOU.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.100
- NO.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.433
- NO, WHAT?
NO.

20:44.433 --> 20:46.300
NOT "NO."
"YES."

20:46.300 --> 20:48.367
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT
TO STAY MAD, DO YOU?

20:48.367 --> 20:50.033
- I'M NOT MAD AT HER ANYMORE.
- YEAH, BUT--BUT--

20:50.033 --> 20:52.567
- I'M JUST GONNA LIVE MY LIFE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:52.567 --> 20:55.800
I THINK MY LIFE IS GONNA
BE BETTER FROM NOW ON.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.833
- BUT IT WON'T!

20:57.833 --> 21:00.067
HOW COULD IT BE?
THERE'S GONNA BE TENSION!

21:00.067 --> 21:01.600
- I THINK WHAT I'VE DONE

21:01.600 --> 21:04.133
IS ACTUALLY REMOVE
THE SOURCE OF THE TENSION.

21:04.133 --> 21:05.133
- YOU MEAN MY MOM?

21:05.133 --> 21:07.333
- I THINK SO, YES.

21:07.333 --> 21:11.767
- [groans loudly]

21:15.033 --> 21:16.467
- GOOD NIGHT.

21:41.800 --> 21:45.800
- KNOCK, KNOCK.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.500
- WHO'S THERE?

21:47.500 --> 21:48.700
- IVAN.

21:48.700 --> 21:50.167
- IVAN WHO?

21:50.167 --> 21:53.300
- I'VE AN IDEA--
TALK TO MY MOTHER.
