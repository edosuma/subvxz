00:05.297 --> 00:06.465
<i>That looks delicious.</i>

00:07.132 --> 00:08.634
<i>Uh-uh. That ain't for you.</i>

00:09.134 --> 00:11.261
<i>That's mean. I'm starving.</i>

00:11.845 --> 00:13.680
Almost done.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.351
Bringing these shrimp po'boys over
to say thanks to Liz for investing.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.936
Twenty grand is a lot of money.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.980
Well, not for Liz.
She's got a $8,000 toilet.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.732
Does it turn shit to gold?

00:23.732 --> 00:25.609
It does not, but it's got a heated seat.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.819
You won't believe
how good it makes your ass feel.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.989
I've never been this uncomfortable
in my life.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.448
What the hell, Dad?

00:33.242 --> 00:34.076
Save yourself.

00:34.660 --> 00:35.494
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.329
Are you kidding me right now?

00:37.913 --> 00:41.124
Hey, if you're mad 'cause it's the morning
and the whole house smells like shrimp--

00:41.124 --> 00:42.543
Where the fuck is all of Mom's stuff?

00:43.126 --> 00:45.587
I can't find her clothes,
her photo albums, nothing.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.465
I wanted to talk to you about that.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.052
Wait, you're not wearing
your wedding ring anymore?

00:53.303 --> 00:55.264
No, I know this is weird.

00:56.473 --> 00:57.808
Look, kid, for the last year,

00:57.808 --> 01:00.435
the thought of moving forward
has felt impossible.

01:01.562 --> 01:06.984
And I'm just starting
to feel like maybe for me it's time.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.570
Does that make sense?

01:10.696 --> 01:12.447
Because fuck the past, right?

01:13.574 --> 01:16.201
You're such a selfish asshole!

01:22.249 --> 01:23.375
She gets it.

01:29.882 --> 01:33.302
Get the fuck out of here.
You're a horrible person.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.387
Is that Liz for, "This is delicious"?

01:35.387 --> 01:36.680
- Oh, yeah.
- It is.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.931
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes!

01:38.432 --> 01:41.059
I haven't had shrimp this good
since I was in "Barthelona."

01:41.059 --> 01:42.519
Derek, absolutely not.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.937
- That's how they say it.
- Oh, my God.

01:43.937 --> 01:47.274
I just wanted to say thank you
for the investment.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.192
Can I thank him too?

01:49.109 --> 01:51.820
Technically, it's his money as well.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.156
I earned my share by raising our children

01:54.156 --> 01:55.532
and I'm quite good at sex.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.702
Oh, yeah. Let me tell ya, rocks aren't
the only thing she knows how to polish.

01:58.702 --> 01:59.703
That's inappropriate.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.705
Okay, I'm gonna go take a look
at some food trucks.

02:01.705 --> 02:02.831
I'll let y'all know how it goes.

02:02.831 --> 02:03.749
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.709
Wow. That was so good.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.628
Babe?

02:08.628 --> 02:11.006
I wanna check out the food trucks.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.634
I wanna pick the truck.
I wanna drive the truck.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.886
I wanna honk the horn
and make it go "beep beep."

02:15.886 --> 02:17.262
Why don't you just tell him that?

02:18.222 --> 02:19.973
- I can't.
- Why?

02:19.973 --> 02:23.393
You love me, so you don't always see it.
I can be a lot.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.562
- No.
- Stop.

02:25.562 --> 02:30.484
It's just-- It's his dream,
and he's not gonna want me hanging around.

02:30.484 --> 02:34.071
Well, would it help to know
that I always want you hanging around?

02:37.741 --> 02:38.951
No, it makes it worse.

02:38.951 --> 02:39.868
Yeah, I figured.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.079
- Quickie later?
- You bet, baby.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.747
I will be lightning fast.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.918
Yeah, you got it. That's the good stuff.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.670
Oh, come on, Dad. It's breakfast.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.921
What are you doing?

02:50.921 --> 02:52.214
Grandpa shit.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.424
Don't pay any attention to them.
They're jealous.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.968
- What do you think, huh?
- It's awesome.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.469
First one's free.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.390
Why's your hand shaking?

03:04.393 --> 03:06.770
I have Parkinson's.

03:10.065 --> 03:13.277
It just means that sometimes
when I want my body to do something,

03:13.277 --> 03:15.696
it doesn't do it right away.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.781
Are you gonna be okay?

03:17.781 --> 03:19.241
Yeah-- W-- Yeah.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.411
Plus, I mean, I get out of
all kinds of stuff I don't wanna do.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.662
Like washing the dishes,

03:23.662 --> 03:29.084
or talking to strangers, or smiling.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.544
I wish I had Parkinson's.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.462
Okay, well, thank you, Dad.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.549
The great news is
that we are gonna see a lot more of him.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.509
And when I'm not with you guys,

03:37.509 --> 03:40.429
Dr. Baram's gonna be helping me,
looking after me.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.055
Why'd your doctor come here?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.724
Because we're having sexual relations.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.100
- Jesus, Paul.
- Really?

04:17.798 --> 04:19.843
Yeah, so then she came back downstairs

04:19.843 --> 04:22.638
and asked me
if the reason I'm losing weight

04:22.638 --> 04:24.264
is to start dating again.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.975
Foolish girl. She complimented you.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.269
I know, that's all I heard.
That I look great.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.104
So, what are you gonna do?

04:32.356 --> 04:34.858
I guess I'm just gonna eat shit
until she gets past it, you know?

04:34.858 --> 04:37.486
And then when she wants more,
I'll be there.

04:38.779 --> 04:39.947
You're a good dad.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.074
Yeah, for two whole weeks.

04:44.076 --> 04:46.995
- The era of shirtless Brian has begun.
- Yeah!

04:46.995 --> 04:50.582
I'm 100% there if I suck in.
Ninety-five percent if I don't.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.043
Is your dad gonna do the best man thing?

04:53.043 --> 04:54.628
Nah, he had to pass.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.089
Had to?

04:58.507 --> 05:00.050
- Could we just not?
- Yeah.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.511
I got plenty of other options.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.304
My big problem's gonna be
narrowing it down.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.139
I don't wanna offend anybody.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.226
I make a lot of people think
that they're my best friend.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.435
It's a gift.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.146
I have to go.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.273
Okay.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.774
- Yeah, sorry.
- No worries.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.068
Wait, you and me,
we are best friends though, right?

05:18.068 --> 05:19.903
There's no one in my life
who matters more to me.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.822
See, you bought that.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.574
Fuck you.

05:34.543 --> 05:35.544
<i>What's up?</i>

05:35.544 --> 05:39.131
I don't wanna just be investors with Sean.
I wanna be partners.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.091
No shit. So why don't you tell him?

05:41.091 --> 05:44.219
What, are you afraid you're gonna be like
Sandra Bullock in The Blind Side?

05:44.219 --> 05:45.762
Everywhere you go,
people gonna look at you and go,

05:45.762 --> 05:48.015
"Look at that Blind Side-ass lady.
Look at her, look at her."

05:49.933 --> 05:55.189
I just don't think
that people like me enough

05:56.315 --> 05:57.900
to do stuff like this with me.

05:57.900 --> 05:58.817
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

05:58.817 --> 06:01.570
Liz, I would not be hanging out
with you for charity, all right?

06:01.570 --> 06:03.572
<i>You're cool. Deal with it.</i>

06:03.572 --> 06:04.656
Thank you.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.368
<i>Wow. Oh, my God.</i>

06:08.368 --> 06:12.122
Sorry. I just--
I love when people say, "Thank you."

06:13.457 --> 06:15.125
Why are you out of breath?
Are you running?

06:15.709 --> 06:16.627
I gotta go.

06:22.799 --> 06:23.800
Holy shit.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.512
- Yay! Okay, I worked hard at that.
- Yeah.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.181
- That Liz's a real piece of work, huh?
- Absolutely.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.558
She needs a lot of reassurance
a lot of times.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.143
Yeah. Okay, my turn now?

06:33.143 --> 06:34.561
No. My text said,

06:35.062 --> 06:36.522
"Do you want
to come over here and service me?"

06:38.607 --> 06:39.983
Fine, but I'm not moving.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.610
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.154
So, you guys wanted to talk some more?

06:44.154 --> 06:46.823
I'm gonna be really quick
because I don't like being vulnerable.

06:46.823 --> 06:51.036
- I know I'm a strong cup of coffee--
- I love my coffee strong.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.913
I'll tell you when it's time to chime in.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.456
Misread it. Thought you were fishing.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.376
Look, I don't have a lot of friends,

06:57.376 --> 07:01.129
but the people that I really connect with,
I would kill or die for them.

07:01.129 --> 07:06.885
And, I'd really like
to be involved in your company.

07:07.594 --> 07:11.723
Not just financially, but everything.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.394
I would really enjoy that.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.396
I'm sorry, what was that?

07:17.396 --> 07:18.730
I would really enjoy that.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.858
Wait, can you say that again?

07:20.858 --> 07:22.985
I know that you might not want to do it

07:22.985 --> 07:26.405
because I can be overbearing.

07:26.405 --> 07:27.990
I know this. And judgy--

07:27.990 --> 07:30.868
Or pretty, or vivacious.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.871
I told you I would tell you
when it was time to chime in.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.914
Why am I here if you're not gonna use me?

07:35.914 --> 07:37.666
I'm gonna stop you right there.

07:37.666 --> 07:40.627
I still gotta take a look at those trucks.
You wanna come with me?

07:40.627 --> 07:41.837
Really?

07:41.837 --> 07:42.880
Yeah.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.424
Thanks.

07:46.842 --> 07:49.428
Before we go, can I use your restroom?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.639
Yep, the special one is that way.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.682
My man.

07:56.810 --> 07:57.811
You okay?

07:59.938 --> 08:02.858
Are you sad because he was so kind to you?

08:05.194 --> 08:06.195
Come here.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.409
- Okay, I'm good.
- Okay.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.952
- Move over a little?
- Sure.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.329
Squinching me.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.375
Hope he's enjoying the ass heater.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.837
Could I have everyone's attention, please?

08:24.463 --> 08:28.842
Thank you so much for coming
to what is essentially my bachelor party.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.719
- You already had a bachelor party.
- No, I didn't.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.261
Not everyone here was invited to that,

08:32.261 --> 08:33.472
so shut it.

08:33.472 --> 08:36.850
Me and Brian and a bunch of his friends
went to a male strip club.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.311
- But it was just for regular.
- No.

08:40.479 --> 08:44.024
So, I need a best man. Or a best person.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.108
Hey now.

08:45.776 --> 08:50.405
Part of tonight's fun is gonna be
a little cornhole tournament.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.532
Winner gets the gig.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.492
- Yeah!
- Good luck, players.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.744
Oh, my God. Even if I win,
I'm gonna give it to D-Train

08:55.744 --> 08:57.871
'cause he's super excited
and that seems funny to me.

08:57.871 --> 08:58.789
Hey!

08:58.789 --> 09:00.332
It's not transferable. It's not--

09:00.332 --> 09:01.250
Come on!

09:01.834 --> 09:05.212
Kip.
You mind if we talk to you for a second?

09:05.212 --> 09:07.047
What are you asking for? Just do it.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.174
I'm so sorry to waste time
with a preamble.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.135
I had a very tough year.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.430
Your son really came through for me.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.348
Same.

09:16.348 --> 09:20.143
Barely knew me, and he kept me out of jail
after I beat somebody almost to death.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.188
In a good way. The guy deserved it.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.233
Good to know.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.027
My point is, he has always got our backs.

09:29.027 --> 09:33.073
It's time for you to have his back.
Just be his best man.

09:36.535 --> 09:38.620
Cornhole!

09:39.705 --> 09:40.956
Brian started that.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.165
Course he did.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.418
Yeah!

09:47.921 --> 09:51.425
I just think I'd be uncomfortable.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.845
I promise you
you will regret it if you don't do this.

09:56.555 --> 10:02.519
Take it from somebody who
dropped the ball as a dad a shit ton.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.191
- Yeah! Fuck yeah!
- Yes! Won my first game.

10:07.191 --> 10:08.609
Say hello to your new best man.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.319
No, Liz's husband. No!

10:10.319 --> 10:11.361
- Yeah. Yes!
- Yeah!

10:11.361 --> 10:13.697
- No, if you win, at best, you're an usher.
- What?

10:13.697 --> 10:16.408
You, get him drunk.
And you, step it the fuck up.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.868
- Don't listen to him. You know why?
- Yeah?

10:17.868 --> 10:19.536
<i>'Cause D-man's gonna be a B-man.</i>

10:19.536 --> 10:22.706
<i>D-man's gonna be a B-man
D-man's gonna be a B-man</i>

10:22.706 --> 10:25.626
<i>D-man's gonna be a B-man
D-man's gonna be a B-man</i>

10:25.626 --> 10:27.461
Great, now that's gonna be
stuck in my head.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.344
<i>Mom, what are we doing?</i>

10:37.054 --> 10:38.305
Why did you wake me up?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.849
There's no good snacks.
Dad is on his health kick.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.643
I know where Dad keeps the good stuff.

10:42.643 --> 10:43.769
Cha-cha!

10:46.230 --> 10:47.272
That sneaky little bitch.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.690
- I know.
- I'm getting spoons.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.864
What are you doing?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.158
Nice try, fucker.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.873
Oh, my God.
We're gonna eat this entire bucket.

11:04.873 --> 11:08.377
And then we have to fill the bucket
with, like kale.

11:16.385 --> 11:17.302
Hey.

11:18.887 --> 11:19.888
Morning.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.772
I can't remember Mom's laugh.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.406
I feel myself, like...

11:39.408 --> 11:40.868
losing little parts of her.

11:41.743 --> 11:42.744
I get that.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.331
I feel like I should have spent more time
with her.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.794
I was always too busy.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.175
Too busy doing what?
Hanging out with Summer?

11:56.175 --> 11:58.343
You were acting like a normal kid.

12:00.012 --> 12:02.097
You loved your mom so much.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.225
And she knew that.

12:07.144 --> 12:08.187
Do you wanna talk?

12:10.772 --> 12:14.109
I'm apparently very, very good at it.
People pay me money.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.033
Well, I'll be here whenever you do. Okay?

12:21.533 --> 12:22.492
Thanks.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.371
Lights.

12:32.878 --> 12:33.879
Okay.

12:39.343 --> 12:41.386
No, I haven't heard anything from her.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.473
If she gets in touch, I'll let you know.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.434
It's just frustrating, you know.

12:47.434 --> 12:52.439
I have all this training and experience,
and I feel so helpless.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.525
You should put that on your business card.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.318
Yeah.

12:57.486 --> 13:00.614
I just don't wanna mess things up
with her again, you know?

13:02.241 --> 13:03.283
You've got this.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.576
Thanks.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.121
Glad things went so well with Meg.

13:09.581 --> 13:10.749
What? Did that not go well?

13:10.749 --> 13:14.336
No. I just know how you're gonna react
to what I am about to say.

13:16.755 --> 13:17.756
It wa--

13:23.470 --> 13:24.972
It was a great visit.

13:25.848 --> 13:29.685
And it wouldn't have happened without you.
So thank you, man.

13:29.685 --> 13:30.894
Of course, Paul.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.357
Oh, my God. Is this happening?

13:35.357 --> 13:37.568
Just fucking do it. Please.

13:37.568 --> 13:38.735
Okay.

13:41.613 --> 13:42.614
Woof.

13:43.907 --> 13:44.908
I woof you too.

13:45.534 --> 13:48.370
Babe, I'm gonna go grab coffee with Gab.

13:48.370 --> 13:51.039
- She at Jimmy's?
- No, why?

13:51.039 --> 13:53.083
I don't--
I didn't know if she ever stays there.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.251
They've been fucking, so...

13:54.251 --> 13:55.377
What?

13:56.962 --> 13:58.046
Did I forget to tell you that?

13:58.046 --> 13:59.965
I will murder you.

13:59.965 --> 14:01.383
How do you know this?

14:01.383 --> 14:06.805
I saw them doing the deed
on the night of the engagement party.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.891
That was a month ago!

14:08.891 --> 14:11.810
Yeah. Who wishes they peed
off the balcony now?

14:11.810 --> 14:12.811
No one!

14:12.811 --> 14:14.146
And it was pretty sexy.

14:14.146 --> 14:15.522
Not the Jimmy parts,

14:15.522 --> 14:18.817
but he did way better than I thought
he would. I'm proud of him.

14:18.817 --> 14:23.655
You saw them
and you stayed out there to watch?

14:23.655 --> 14:25.199
Oh, come on.

14:25.199 --> 14:27.659
What was I supposed to do? Not watch?

14:28.577 --> 14:29.912
- Fair.
- Yeah.

14:29.912 --> 14:30.829
Did you film it?

14:30.829 --> 14:31.997
I'm not a pervert.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.124
I didn't have to.

14:34.124 --> 14:37.336
I can't believe she didn't tell me.
That sucks.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.880
If you see Jimmy, tell him congrats.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.256
Oh, my God.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.342
And he's got a nice ass.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.594
Could do with some squats though.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.139
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

14:49.681 --> 14:53.393
As you know, I give these special agates
to a select few people.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.856
People that have come through for me
so much that I welcome them

14:57.856 --> 15:00.067
into the Covenant of the Rock.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.569
Okay, that's sounding very "cult-y,"
and I'm fucking in.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.530
What do I need to do? Wear a long tunic?

15:04.530 --> 15:06.990
Do I need to kill a goat?
'Cause I'll do that shit for that.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.868
You don't have to do anything.
Just know I appreciate you.

15:10.827 --> 15:11.828
Not yet.

15:11.828 --> 15:12.746
Don't play with me.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.790
How could you not tell me
you fucked Jimmy?

15:14.790 --> 15:16.917
Fine, all right! Goddamn.

15:16.917 --> 15:20.212
I fucked Jimmy, all right?
I fucked him. I fucked him. I fucked him.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.505
Give me more details.

15:21.505 --> 15:25.717
It's really good. It's like "Mariah Carey
hitting the high note" good.

15:25.717 --> 15:26.802
No.

15:26.802 --> 15:28.011
Yeah, like...

15:30.472 --> 15:33.642
The best part about it is,
he didn't even slap my boobs.

15:33.642 --> 15:34.810
Who smacks boobs?

15:34.810 --> 15:35.936
A lot of guys out there,

15:35.936 --> 15:38.981
for some reason, these days,
are hitting titties, left and right.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.816
I swear, they're, like, smacking 'em
and hitting 'em.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.651
I don't know
if it was in some 4Chan forum.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.778
I don't know where these fucking guys
are reading it from,

15:44.778 --> 15:46.780
but these guys are out here
smacking titties.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.198
I don't think that's true.

15:48.198 --> 15:52.119
You know, he's not really into butt play,
but I'll get in there.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.413
I put so much stuff in Derek's butt.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.123
You're lying.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.791
I know, but I could if I wanted to.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.460
And the best part about it is,
is that it's total safe dick.

16:01.587 --> 16:03.881
- Safe dick is the best dick.
- I know.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.717
All right. You've earned it.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.012
Wow. Okay. So what do we do?

16:10.012 --> 16:12.055
Do we do a ceremony? Do we need to chant?

16:12.055 --> 16:13.724
Nope. Just love you.

16:14.308 --> 16:15.309
Love you.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.272
Well, now that we are officially sisters

16:20.272 --> 16:22.107
- of the Covenant of the Rock...
- Yeah?

16:22.608 --> 16:26.153
...do you mind reading
this letter of recommendation for me?

16:26.737 --> 16:27.821
Yeah, of course. What's it for?

16:27.821 --> 16:29.531
It's actually for this job
that I really want.

16:29.531 --> 16:32.284
And Paul told me that if I write it,
then he will sign it for me.

16:32.284 --> 16:35.162
I just wanna make sure it sounds
like a cranky old white dude wrote it.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.749
Wait. Paul knows
the guy you're interviewing with

16:38.749 --> 16:41.460
and he couldn't write a letter himself?

16:41.460 --> 16:42.628
It's bullshit. I know.

16:42.628 --> 16:44.129
He's never getting a rock.

16:45.214 --> 16:47.424
So I'm still booping him. "Boop."

16:47.424 --> 16:49.801
Because most of the time
it stops his bullshit.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.429
Only downside is now I can see

16:52.429 --> 16:54.681
what an emotionally abusive fuckface
he's been.

16:55.974 --> 17:00.229
You know, when Donny used to criticize me,
I would always think it was my fault.

17:01.522 --> 17:04.608
But now, if he's like,
"Your eggs are too runny,"

17:04.608 --> 17:07.277
I think he's lucky
we're not eating breakfast on a cliff

17:07.277 --> 17:09.738
'cause I'd push him off
and watch his skull crack open,

17:09.738 --> 17:11.949
and I would be like,
"Your brains are too runny, bitch."

17:11.949 --> 17:14.492
Yes, Grace! That's what I'm talking about.

17:14.492 --> 17:18.247
Off the cliff. Bash them brains.
Eat them up.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.416
Seriously, look at how much stronger
you are now.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.337
I'm just-- I'm so proud of you.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.758
I know I'm not great at real feelings,

17:30.259 --> 17:33.720
but I like the person I'm starting to be.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.474
And I wanted to thank you for it.

17:40.811 --> 17:41.937
It's my pleasure.

17:46.942 --> 17:47.943
Bye.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.158
She doesn't look crazy. How is she crazy?

17:55.158 --> 17:56.326
Oh, yay. Liz is here.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.537
All right, listen. I need your help
tearing Paul a new one.

17:58.537 --> 17:59.454
Why?

17:59.454 --> 18:03.375
Because he's messing with Gaby's shit.
That's why. Put your game face on.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.628
It's not that simple, Liz.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.423
Paul and I just hugged.

18:10.007 --> 18:13.594
Are you fucking serious right now?
Let's go, Safe Dick.

18:14.428 --> 18:17.014
Safe-- How do you know about that?

18:21.435 --> 18:22.436
We need to talk.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.231
First you raw dog me in public

18:26.231 --> 18:29.401
and now you burst into my office
and raw dog me here?

18:29.985 --> 18:31.278
Stop saying "raw dog."

18:31.278 --> 18:32.779
I can say anything I want.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.698
Tell him what raw dog means.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.575
Sex without a condom.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.620
Then I'll stop saying that.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.247
Gaby asked you for a recommendation,

18:42.247 --> 18:44.499
and you couldn't be bothered
to write it yourself?

18:45.083 --> 18:46.418
I've got bad news, dude.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.837
- I gave her a rock.
- A rock?

18:48.837 --> 18:51.215
And in your mind, that makes sense?

18:51.215 --> 18:54.343
You're being a lazy, ungrateful prick,

18:54.927 --> 18:56.386
and Jimmy thinks so too.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.640
Do you think I'm being a lazy,
ungrateful prick?

19:02.184 --> 19:04.520
- Pussy!
- Fair.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.272
He's just being quiet because you hugged.

19:13.737 --> 19:14.947
You told her about our hug?

19:14.947 --> 19:16.031
Look,

19:17.199 --> 19:20.619
you and I got to work together for, like,
five years before Gaby even got here.

19:20.619 --> 19:22.746
And I appreciate all the guidance
you give me.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.040
But you don't give Gaby that kind of time.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.125
And even still,
she's always looking out for you.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.710
She gave you that water bottle--

19:28.710 --> 19:30.379
To keep you fucking hydrated!

19:30.379 --> 19:31.588
She drives you to work--

19:31.588 --> 19:34.800
To-and-fro every goddamn day!

19:35.384 --> 19:38.595
Listen, Paul. You know what I'm gonna say.
You're being--

19:38.595 --> 19:41.223
An arrogant, sexist piece of shit.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.100
How about you stop finishing my sentences?

19:43.100 --> 19:44.977
I'm not wrong though.

19:44.977 --> 19:47.437
This guy has a case of the sniffles,

19:47.437 --> 19:50.482
and you're right there
with Kleenex and a six-pack.

19:51.275 --> 19:52.442
And what about Gaby?

19:53.151 --> 19:54.152
She's--

19:54.152 --> 19:55.529
Fix it.

19:56.405 --> 19:57.447
Pussy!

20:00.158 --> 20:05.747
What kind of a person hugs and tells?

20:06.331 --> 20:07.332
I know.

20:24.850 --> 20:25.976
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.520
What's this?

20:28.520 --> 20:30.731
This is your mom's stuff. Yeah.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.233
Just 'cause I'm ready
to put this stuff away,

20:33.233 --> 20:35.319
that does not mean
that you have to be. Come.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.529
Yeah.

20:38.614 --> 20:40.699
She loved this dress.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.075
Yeah, she did.

20:46.205 --> 20:49.499
"Once you go Asian,
you won't go Caucasian."

20:51.293 --> 20:54.796
Your mom used to wear that when
we took hikes to make me uncomfortable.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.465
I am wearing this to school on Monday.

20:56.465 --> 20:58.342
I look forward to the call
from your principal.

20:59.510 --> 21:00.594
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.305
Last one.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.643
Oh, my God! Her hot-as-shit shoes!

21:07.643 --> 21:08.560
Oh, yeah.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.521
Remember that time when...

21:11.855 --> 21:14.191
I don't know why I'm telling you.
You know.

21:14.775 --> 21:16.109
You can tell this guy.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.361
Yeah. Hit me.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.743
Mom called these her "hot-as-shit shoes"

21:24.743 --> 21:28.497
because she said no matter
how crappy her day was going,

21:28.497 --> 21:30.958
once she put these on,
she felt hot as shit.

21:30.958 --> 21:31.875
Okay.

21:34.670 --> 21:38.757
One time,
she was having, like, the worst day,

21:39.466 --> 21:41.343
and I walked into her room,

21:41.343 --> 21:47.224
and she was lying in bed,
wearing her hot-as-shit shoes.

21:48.225 --> 21:51.979
Dude, oh, my God. I had a soccer game,
and Mom showed up wearing these.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.856
And her calves were obviously, like...

21:54.690 --> 21:56.275
You know, just, like, fully flexed.

21:56.275 --> 21:58.944
She was just looking at her feet.

21:59.653 --> 22:02.656
And all of the moms in the bleachers
were looking at her like she was crazy.

22:04.950 --> 22:07.744
Okay. Okay.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.999
You got this. You got this.

22:12.708 --> 22:15.377
Big coochie energy. Big coochie energy.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.462
Big, fat coochie energy.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.757
With your full-time practice,

22:20.757 --> 22:23.760
is teaching more than one seminar
next semester even possible?

22:23.760 --> 22:26.972
I'm great at time management.
Like, I kick ass at it.

22:26.972 --> 22:28.182
And even if I'm tied up,

22:28.182 --> 22:31.602
I can always ask the TA
to play old episodes of Frasier.

22:33.478 --> 22:34.396
Uh-huh.

22:34.897 --> 22:38.358
That's the great sense of humor Paul
mentioned in the recommendation letter.

22:38.942 --> 22:40.152
He did say that.

22:42.279 --> 22:44.031
Stop being smug, Gerald.

22:45.282 --> 22:47.367
Paul, what the fuck are you doing here?

22:47.367 --> 22:49.036
Also, how'd you know he's being smug?

22:49.036 --> 22:53.165
Because he's Gerald.
Even me barging in here won't mean shit.

22:53.165 --> 22:57.336
All the good jobs around here go to
whoever can crawl up his ass the farthest.

22:57.336 --> 22:58.253
By the way,

22:58.253 --> 22:59.963
is Lenny Klein still up there?

22:59.963 --> 23:01.048
Say hi for me.

23:01.048 --> 23:03.926
I will. He's coming with my lunch
in 15 minutes.

23:05.135 --> 23:06.261
Hire her.

23:06.845 --> 23:08.847
She's a brilliant therapist.

23:09.348 --> 23:12.226
Paul, I've already told her
she's got the job.

23:13.727 --> 23:17.814
Well then, read your emails,
'cause I'm gonna finish this.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.399
Okay.

23:20.692 --> 23:24.446
She's the most empathetic clinician
I've ever crossed paths with,

23:25.030 --> 23:26.990
which is why
her patients love her so much.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.075
And,

23:29.034 --> 23:32.246
I do not tell her often enough

23:33.330 --> 23:37.417
how much I value her as a colleague.

23:37.417 --> 23:42.673
Because apparently, I'm not good
with the women I care about.

23:42.673 --> 23:43.841
No, not at all.

23:43.841 --> 23:45.133
But I'm working on it.

23:46.927 --> 23:50.305
And I plan to have it down
by the time I'm 140.

23:50.305 --> 23:55.227
And I will live till then,
because I drink a lot of water.

23:59.606 --> 24:00.774
Are you about done?

24:00.774 --> 24:02.317
Give me your car keys.

24:02.317 --> 24:03.819
You're my ride home.

24:03.819 --> 24:05.195
I'll wait in the car.

24:14.413 --> 24:16.290
What a strange man.

24:16.290 --> 24:18.750
Yeah. And he's super mean too.

24:33.724 --> 24:35.934
Hey, we're almost late. You ready?

24:36.435 --> 24:38.187
Yeah. Just tying my tie.

24:38.687 --> 24:40.981
- You nervous about your wedding speech?
- Nope.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.901
Okay. I'll see you downstairs.

24:46.862 --> 24:49.239
- Where the hell is Jimmy?
- Hey, don't worry. He'll show.

24:49.239 --> 24:52.534
And if he doesn't, as best man,
I get to beat the shit out of him.

24:52.534 --> 24:53.744
Thanks, Dad.

24:54.995 --> 24:57.539
We'll give him two minutes,
and then we'll kick his ass together.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.540
That would be nice.

24:58.540 --> 25:02.211
Okay. Everyone is sitting. I crushed it.

25:02.794 --> 25:05.005
It's still surreal to me
that you're in my wedding party,

25:05.005 --> 25:07.508
but top-notch ushering, Derek.

25:08.091 --> 25:09.927
Der-- He knows my name!

25:10.719 --> 25:11.929
Big day for both of us!

25:12.846 --> 25:13.680
- Hey!
- Hey.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.806
- Okay.
- I'm here.

25:14.806 --> 25:16.350
- Great.
- Yeah, okay.

25:16.350 --> 25:18.477
Stop eye-fucking me.
I was working on my speech.

25:18.477 --> 25:22.731
- Okay. Let's do this. It's go time.
- Okay.

25:23.524 --> 25:24.525
Okay.

25:26.026 --> 25:27.027
Okay.

25:29.696 --> 25:30.822
Here we are.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.664
Hey,

25:38.664 --> 25:43.710
did anybody notice that this wedding venue
is like a tight pair of trousers?

25:44.962 --> 25:45.963
No ballroom.

25:51.218 --> 25:55.556
Sorry.
I think I'm probably a little bit nervous.

25:55.556 --> 25:57.724
Brian knocked this out of the park
for Tia and I.

25:57.724 --> 25:58.851
Tia and me.

25:58.851 --> 26:00.352
- Nobody cares.
- Well...

26:00.352 --> 26:03.146
Okay. Marriage...

26:13.866 --> 26:19.288
Marriage is a tough thing
for me to talk about.

26:21.123 --> 26:24.918
I'm sure many of you know,
a little over a year ago, my wife died.

26:28.505 --> 26:29.506
It destroyed me.

26:30.215 --> 26:32.217
Did not know
if I was gonna find my way out.

26:33.051 --> 26:35.637
To be totally honest,
some days, I am still not sure.

26:39.057 --> 26:40.893
But, man, was it worth it.

26:43.896 --> 26:49.359
Every single second
that I got to spend with my wife...

26:52.905 --> 26:54.489
was the best moment of my life.

26:57.826 --> 27:00.537
I would not be here today
if it was not for Tia.

27:00.537 --> 27:04.333
And none of us would be, because Tia is
the one who introduced Brian and Charlie.

27:05.334 --> 27:07.419
It's a little-known fact that,
after their first date,

27:08.128 --> 27:11.465
both of them independently texted Tia,

27:12.466 --> 27:13.717
"I don't think so."

27:17.471 --> 27:18.472
And yet, here we are.

27:19.431 --> 27:24.061
Because Tia knew that these two
were perfect for each other.

27:26.188 --> 27:31.818
My wife believed that the best way
to help yourself was to help others.

27:32.569 --> 27:33.987
And boy, was she right.

27:33.987 --> 27:38.492
Do me a favor, will you?
Turn around. Turn-- Look at your friends.

27:39.910 --> 27:41.453
You've got so many friends.

27:42.621 --> 27:46.333
You've got each other,
but never forget that you have them too.

27:48.252 --> 27:53.215
They're here today to celebrate you
and to get drunk later.

27:54.007 --> 27:56.635
And someone's gonna hook up. Who knows?

28:00.180 --> 28:01.557
But they've also got your back.

28:05.477 --> 28:06.812
And when life gets rough...

28:09.147 --> 28:11.859
they are gonna be the ones
who help you get to the other side.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.864
- Right?
- Yes.

28:17.447 --> 28:19.199
- Right?
- Yeah!

28:19.867 --> 28:20.868
So with that,

28:22.244 --> 28:24.788
what do you say
we get this fucking wedding started, huh?

28:26.206 --> 28:27.708
Christ, I thought it was over.

28:27.708 --> 28:30.252
- That was loud.
- Sorry.

28:30.252 --> 28:35.048
I now pronounce you husbands.
You may kiss your grooms.

28:52.941 --> 28:55.277
I can hear your vagina humming.

28:55.861 --> 28:57.362
He's not safe dick.

29:03.285 --> 29:08.707
Hey, I liked what you said up there
about helping others to help ourselves.

29:08.707 --> 29:11.210
I think that's probably why we do
what we do, right?

29:12.211 --> 29:13.462
Still, I mean...

29:15.380 --> 29:18.300
All that crazy shit you did with patients.

29:19.635 --> 29:23.138
I'm surprised
you didn't burn the whole practice down.

29:23.847 --> 29:24.890
Let's be honest.

29:26.808 --> 29:27.851
I got really lucky.

29:29.937 --> 29:30.979
So did I.

30:17.609 --> 30:18.735
I'm gonna sit.

30:19.611 --> 30:20.612
First time.

31:05.032 --> 31:06.700
You look so much like your mom.

31:23.717 --> 31:26.220
I'm tired. I wanna head back.

31:26.220 --> 31:28.096
Seriously? Are you that out of shape?

31:28.096 --> 31:30.015
You can keep going. I'm just done.

31:31.934 --> 31:34.269
And, you know,
you don't get to just talk to me that way.

31:34.853 --> 31:36.396
I'll talk to you however I want.

31:37.314 --> 31:39.483
I'm sick of you acting
like you're better than me.

31:39.483 --> 31:40.567
That shit is over.

31:40.567 --> 31:45.572
You're an idiot, Grace,
so shut the fuck up, or I'll shut you up.

31:51.703 --> 31:52.704
Beautiful view, though.

32:15.102 --> 32:16.103
Boop.
