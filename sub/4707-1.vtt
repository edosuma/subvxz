01:41.036 --> 01:46.040
ONE DAY

03:05.120 --> 03:06.314
Bye, guys.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.674
It's three years.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.153
Three years together.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.389
The lads.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.669
Me and you?

03:11.760 --> 03:14.115
We'll see each other again.
Really?

03:14.200 --> 03:15.349
They're not going,
are they?

03:16.520 --> 03:18.875
Group hug!

03:18.960 --> 03:21.679
See you, ladies!
See you later.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.438
Group hug.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.476
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:28.320 --> 03:29.594
Tilly?

03:29.920 --> 03:30.955
Callum!

03:31.040 --> 03:32.871
Tilly, come on.
It's time to go home.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.916
Come on.
Callum!

03:35.720 --> 03:37.312
Ow!

03:43.080 --> 03:45.275
You know,
we've never actually met.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.554
Actually, we have.
Several times.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.629
Have we?

03:47.720 --> 03:50.553
You gatecrashed my birthday party,
called me Julie,

03:50.640 --> 03:52.039
and spilled red wine
down my top.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.189
Ouch.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.319
Well, I'm sorry
about that.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.435
No, not at all.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.509
You were delightful.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.555
Was I?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.312
No. No, you weren't.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.516
Look, if you're
not Julie, then...

04:02.600 --> 04:03.794
I'm Emma.
Emma.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.996
Emma Morley.
Emma Morley.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.477
Listen, I'll walk you home.

04:11.760 --> 04:12.829
So this is me.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.239
Shh!
Welcome home.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.993
So debate is fine,
but anyone can talk...

04:21.360 --> 04:23.828
Just sometimes,
action's what's needed.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.230
To change the world.
I completely agree.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.749
So what are you gonna be when you're,
I don't know, 40?

04:31.840 --> 04:32.829
Forty?

04:32.960 --> 04:35.952
Can I say famous?
Horribly rich?

04:36.040 --> 04:38.634
Terrible.
You're so terribly posh.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.435
Where are you going?

04:40.520 --> 04:41.475
I'm just gonna
go brush my teeth.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.993
You know,
booze and fags and...

04:43.080 --> 04:44.069
I don't mind.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.195
I do.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.910
Listen, won't be a minute.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.832
No playing with yourself
while I'm gone.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.714
What?

05:06.960 --> 05:09.315
All right, concentrate.

05:09.400 --> 05:13.075
Concentrate.
Do not cock this up!

05:27.400 --> 05:28.674
Oh, you're going?

05:28.760 --> 05:31.672
Well, it's getting light out,
so I thought I could just...

05:31.760 --> 05:33.716
You should go
if you want to go.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.869
It's very poignant.
Very bittersweet.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.996
Really I just thought you
might wanna get some sleep.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.115
I don't have to go.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.315
No, no, go.
I'm not bothered.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.839
Sneak off.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.069
I wasn't sneaking off.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.434
Jump out the window
for all I care.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.953
It's five floors up, mind.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.076
Look, I'll stay.
All right?

05:47.800 --> 05:49.791
I'll stay.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.279
Come on.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.109
Sorry, I'm no good at this.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.430
It's just whenever
I go to bed with someone,

06:00.520 --> 06:03.830
I always end up
either laughing or weeping,

06:03.920 --> 06:05.831
and it could be nice to go
for something in between.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.354
Look, that's fine.

06:08.440 --> 06:11.512
That's fine. Maybe we
could just be friends.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.313
Okay. Friends.

06:25.920 --> 06:30.038
Of course, you know it's Saint Swithin's
Day today, don't you?

06:30.160 --> 06:31.718
What is?

06:31.800 --> 06:35.759
Well, today. Saint Swithin's Day,
the 15th of July.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.637
How do you know that?

06:37.720 --> 06:40.473
Well, he was buried in
Winchester Cathedral,

06:40.560 --> 06:42.755
which is where
I went to school.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.279
Well, la-dee-da.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.833
La-dee-da.

06:47.320 --> 06:50.153
You know, there's a poem.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.949
"If on Saint Swithin's Day,
it doth rain

06:54.040 --> 06:58.352
"something, something,
something remain."

06:58.480 --> 07:00.232
Dexter, that's beautiful.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.072
Shut up.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.549
Let's get some sleep.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.199
But, Dex.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.673
Em?

07:14.760 --> 07:16.512
If it doesn't rain...

07:16.600 --> 07:17.953
Mmm-hmm?

07:20.040 --> 07:22.918
...do you want to do something?
Me and you?

07:23.960 --> 07:25.154
Mmm-hmm.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.675
Are you all right?
Lift, lift.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.870
Okay, well,
I'm coming up.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.635
Couldn't you have just hired
someone to move this stuff?

07:36.720 --> 07:37.755
No.

07:38.640 --> 07:39.959
Look, I would have paid.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.235
All right, lift from your end.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.912
You've obviously never done
a day's work in your life.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.595
Look, seriously, Em,
my plane leaves in four hours.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.114
All right, well, all the more
reason why you should lift.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.719
God's sake.

07:53.000 --> 07:53.989
Look, I'm doing you a favor.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.036
And I am so, so grateful.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.798
Stop whinging.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.631
I bet this bed could
tell some stories.

08:01.720 --> 08:04.951
Yeah, short stories.
Horror stories.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.873
Welcome to London.
Well, lift it.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.310
I think I'm gonna
be very happy here.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.753
What is that smell?

08:15.920 --> 08:17.239
Onions.

08:17.320 --> 08:18.912
Onions and disappointment.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.628
Right.

08:20.760 --> 08:21.988
No, it's not that bad.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.275
It's nothing that a
lick of paint

08:24.440 --> 08:26.635
and a nuclear warhead can't fix.

08:26.720 --> 08:30.156
I've got my typewriter.
I've got my books. I'm in London.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.508
I think it's going to be all right.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.828
I might actually
get things done.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.797
You know, you might
actually meet someone.

08:34.880 --> 08:35.869
Dexter, please.

08:36.000 --> 08:36.989
A nice guy.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.599
Sensitive, wears a cardigan.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.198
I told you I'm not interested
in any of that.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.350
Matching glasses,
matching opinions.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.873
I'm actually glad
you're going to India.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.310
Good, 'cause I'm leaving.
I've got to catch my flight.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.992
Already?

08:49.120 --> 08:50.712
Yeah, I'm sorry.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.713
Well, go on then.
Find yourself.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.950
Keep sending me those letters.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.871
Long ones.
I will.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.474
And have fun, Em.

09:01.640 --> 09:02.834
Of course.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.478
You know, it is allowed.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.151
You know, I've got a feeling
that this time next year

09:07.240 --> 09:08.798
you're going to take
London by storm.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.919
What is the difference between...

09:18.000 --> 09:19.319
A tortilla is either corn or wheat.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.311
But a corn tortilla folded
and filled is a taco,

09:21.480 --> 09:23.391
whereas a filled wheat
tortilla is a burrito.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.072
Deep fry a burrito,
it's a chimichanga.

09:25.160 --> 09:28.914
Toast a tortilla, it's a tostada.
Roll it, it's an enchilada.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.956
Is there any chance
you could repeat that?

09:35.400 --> 09:37.914
Hello. I'm Ian.
Ian Whitehead.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.911
The new boy.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.797
Welcome to the graveyard
of ambition.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.597
The kitchen.
All right, mate.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.796
What these guys can't
do with a microwave,

09:47.880 --> 09:48.995
and a deep-fat fryer.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.149
Hey, you!

09:50.720 --> 09:52.995
Your basic Tex-Mex food groups.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.752
Cheese on top of chicken
under guacamole

09:54.840 --> 09:57.274
on top of beans
under rice on top of beef.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.915
Word of warning,
avoid the jumbo prawns.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.798
It's like Russian Roulette.
One in six will kill you.

10:03.880 --> 10:04.995
So what's your stroke?

10:05.400 --> 10:06.753
Sorry, my what?

10:06.840 --> 10:10.196
Waiter/actor,
waiter/model, waiter/writer?

10:10.280 --> 10:11.872
Well, I'm a comedian.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.075
We could use a comedian. We all
like to laugh. I know I used to.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.593
Well, I'm just
starting out really.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.075
Working on my
"unique comedy stylings."

10:20.160 --> 10:24.039
Not jokes so much, more sort of wry,
little observations.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.993
Ay caramba!

10:26.240 --> 10:27.593
I've got this whole bit
at the moment

10:27.680 --> 10:29.830
about the difference
between men and women.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.992
How blokes, when they see a
girl they fancy, they get all...

10:33.080 --> 10:35.514
Toilets. Staff toilets.
Oh.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.874
Sorry. You were saying?

10:36.960 --> 10:40.157
No, no. I'm doing an open mic tonight
if you were interested.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.869
At The House of Laffs,
spelled L-A-F-F-S.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.109
It's not a date or anything.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.191
You've probably got a
boyfriend anyway, have you?

10:48.960 --> 10:52.032
Ian, I'd love to come,
but after work,

10:52.120 --> 10:54.714
I like to head home,
comfort eat, weep.

10:56.120 --> 10:59.317
So what about you, Emma?
What's your stroke?

10:59.400 --> 11:01.311
What do you really do?

11:01.400 --> 11:04.392
Uh, this. This is what I do.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.594
Still, it's not forever, is it?

11:12.040 --> 11:15.828
My room still smells. Tilly's sending
me mad. The flat's a dump.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.876
I keep finding teeth
marks in the cheese

11:18.200 --> 11:20.191
and her big gray bras
soaking in the sink.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.077
Look, I'm sure it's
not a complete disaster.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.599
London's swallowed me up.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.159
I thought I'd make a difference,
but no one knows I'm here.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.595
Listen, listen. Nothing truly
good was ever easy.

11:32.680 --> 11:33.669
who said that?

11:34.360 --> 11:35.349
You did.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.919
Did I? That's annoying.

11:37.720 --> 11:41.713
I'm sorry for moaning. I just...
I really wanted to hear...

11:41.800 --> 11:43.518
How's teaching?
How's Paris?

11:44.160 --> 11:45.434
It's good, Em.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.909
You know, truly, really fulfilling.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.036
well, don't sleep with
any of your students.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.196
It's unethical and predictable.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.918
It's good advice, Em.
Thank you.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.392
But I've got to go
and have lunch with Mum.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.756
well, apologize again, will you?

11:59.840 --> 12:02.115
I didn't mean to
call your dad a fascist.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.719
A bourgeois fascist.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.712
Say sorry and, Dexter...

12:06.800 --> 12:07.994
My money's running out.
Em?

12:08.120 --> 12:10.236
Can you hear me?
Dex? Dex?

12:17.320 --> 12:18.992
I miss you.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.468
Forty-five minutes late.

12:44.600 --> 12:45.828
Yeah, well, I got waylaid.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.512
And where were
you last night?

12:47.640 --> 12:48.914
Language school disco.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.434
Was it fun?
No, it was hell.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.432
Tell me, who's been writing you
all those long letters?

12:55.520 --> 12:57.272
That is none of your business.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.113
Was it that girl
who came to stay?

13:00.200 --> 13:01.679
Yeah. Well, Emma and I
are just good friends.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.793
How much holiday
do you need?

13:07.880 --> 13:10.633
I'm not on holiday.
I'm teaching English.

13:10.720 --> 13:11.709
Dexter.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.277
Isn't that Alain Delon?

13:16.360 --> 13:18.669
What?
Oh, no. It's your father.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.589
Picking his corns.
Stop it.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.071
Take me for lunch
tomorrow, will you?

13:28.200 --> 13:31.749
Just you and me. Somewhere quiet
with white tablecloths.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.876
I want to talk to you.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.069
Why? Is something wrong?

13:35.160 --> 13:37.469
No. Nothing's wrong.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.788
Then why do we need to talk?

13:38.920 --> 13:40.592
Do I need a reason?

13:41.200 --> 13:43.475
There you are.
Degenerate.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.757
Now, I thought
you might want these.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.114
Oh, thank you, my love.

13:55.960 --> 14:00.590
So what's for supper?
Please, God, not French food.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.829
Golden Boy wants to see you.
Hmm?

14:17.960 --> 14:19.951
He's got a new one.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.632
Good night.
Good night.

14:27.760 --> 14:28.954
Night.
Good night.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.035
Have a good one.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.109
We were just kissing.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.749
You were trying to fit her
entire head in your mouth.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.877
People have enough trouble
keeping the food down as it is.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.837
And what does she
see in you, anyway?

14:40.920 --> 14:43.036
Well, she says
I'm complicated.

14:44.520 --> 14:45.919
You're just spoiled.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.159
I got offered the job
of manager today.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.708
They told me they wanted someone
who wasn't going anywhere.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.837
All right, Em, listen. I think you
should take a bottle of tequila,

14:57.920 --> 14:59.399
I think you should
walk out the door,

14:59.520 --> 15:01.033
and I don't think you
need to ever come back.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.633
But my job is my life.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.792
You can't throw away years
of your life just because,

15:05.880 --> 15:07.836
well, you think it's funny.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.151
My hair smells of cheese.
Monterey Jack.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.156
Look, I thought you
were writing poetry.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.312
What, go where the money is?
Tried that. Failed.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.238
You just can't
see it, can you?

15:19.320 --> 15:22.153
Look, you're funny. You're attractive.
You're smart.

15:22.240 --> 15:24.231
I mean, you're
the smartest person I know.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.635
Sure.
You are. You're attractive.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.312
You're sexy.
What?

15:28.400 --> 15:30.436
What? Is that supposed to be
sexist or something?

15:30.520 --> 15:34.229
No, it's not sexist.
It's just ridiculous.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.833
Em, listen.

15:38.440 --> 15:40.476
If I could just give
you one gift, all right,

15:40.600 --> 15:42.591
one gift for the
rest of your life,

15:42.680 --> 15:45.478
do you know what I'd give you?

15:45.560 --> 15:46.879
Confidence.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.035
It's either that
or a scented candle.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.519
Come here.

15:54.560 --> 15:58.838
Emma? So I've disinfected
the meat fridge.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.638
My hero.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.280
Thank you, Ian.
See you tomorrow.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.793
Bye, mate.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.909
Bye, Emma.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.797
I should go, too.
All right.

16:10.880 --> 16:14.395
I'll be fine. I just
feel a bit lost, that's all.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.755
Come on, everyone's lost at 25.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.353
You're not.

16:18.440 --> 16:22.479
Trainee TV producer.
Nice new flat. CD player.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.391
Group sex
Tuesdays and Fridays.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.631
Yeah, but you know,
I am crying on the inside.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.114
You know what you need,
don't you?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.519
Mmm-mmm.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.751
You need a holiday.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.673
Look, Dexter, all I'm saying is
I think we need some rules.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.318
Rules!

16:44.440 --> 16:46.795
I'm not taking any chances
with our friendship,all right.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.672
All right, all right.
Such as?

16:48.760 --> 16:49.909
Separate bedrooms.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.594
Wherever we stay, no shared beds,
no drunken cuddles.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.716
I don't see the point
of cuddling, anyway.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.915
Cuddling gives you cramp.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.035
Agreed, then.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.879
Rule number two.
No flirting.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.235
No having a few drinks
and getting frisky with me.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.309
Or anyone else.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.355
Well, I never flirt.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.953
I'm serious.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.512
Hello, what's this?

17:19.040 --> 17:20.996
Which leads me to rule three.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.150
The nudity clause.
What?

17:23.240 --> 17:25.435
I don't want to see you
in the shower, or have a wee.

17:25.520 --> 17:26.999
Or have a wee in the shower.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.314
Well, I can't promise that.

17:28.440 --> 17:29.919
You have to, Dex.
It's the rules,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.675
and absolutely
no skinny-dipping.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.710
All right, then. Rule number four.
What?

17:37.800 --> 17:39.552
No Scrabble.
I love Scrabble.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.473
That is exactly
why it's my rule.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.788
Look, we're not dead yet.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.079
Voilà.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.754
What is that?

18:03.840 --> 18:07.196
Hmm? My swimming costume.
It's called the Edwardian.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.794
No, the masonry paint.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.474
It's factor 30. I burn.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.516
Here, let me.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.112
I've not seen this before.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.714
What, that?
I got that in Thailand.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.637
It's a yin-yang.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.876
Looks like a road sign.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.633
Yeah, well, it means
"the perfect union of opposites."

18:42.720 --> 18:44.950
It means "wear some socks."

18:50.080 --> 18:53.117
This is scooped a
bit low, isn't it?

18:53.200 --> 18:56.033
Good job I didn't
put it on backwards.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.435
I think I'll go for a dip.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.391
This is a nudist beach.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.515
No, it's not.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.910
It is. Look.
They're barbecuing!

19:42.000 --> 19:44.833
You see, I couldn't do that.
Barbecue naked.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.639
What is that?
Is that yoga?

19:47.760 --> 19:49.398
Oh, God.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.950
Grow up, all right.
Back to your magazine.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.239
I can hear you thinking. It's
like this crunching noise.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.799
The answer is no.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.919
Don't you think we'd feel more
comfortable with our clothes off?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.718
Unbelievable.
Just unbelievable.

20:07.800 --> 20:08.949
Well, why not?

20:09.040 --> 20:12.271
The rules. Not to
mention your girlfriend.

20:12.360 --> 20:13.759
What, Ingrid?
Yeah, Ingrid.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.831
She's very uninhibited.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.717
She'd have had her top off
at the check-in desk.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.075
Well, as you keep pointing out,
Ingrid used to be a model.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.515
You could be a model.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.830
For a catalog or something.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.868
I'm just saying that we're not
entirely unknown to each other

20:27.960 --> 20:29.234
from a physical point of view.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.435
Drop it, Dex.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.353
Well, you know,
that night after graduation.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.839
Come on, you must remember.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.678
No. Blanked it out
like a car crash.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.069
Well, I haven't.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.390
In fact, if I close my eyes,

20:41.480 --> 20:44.119
I can still see you there just
standing in the dawn light.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.235
Please don't.

20:45.320 --> 20:48.118
Provocatively unclasping
your dungarees

20:48.200 --> 20:49.315
as you walk over to me.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.992
I was not wearing
dungarees.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.992
So you do remember, huh?

20:59.600 --> 21:01.397
Have I caught the sun?

21:02.040 --> 21:04.838
No, you look...

21:04.920 --> 21:06.592
You look fine.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.873
Do you know I've
never been abroad?

21:20.960 --> 21:22.439
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

21:22.520 --> 21:23.953
It's true.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.998
Fortnight in a caravan in Whitby
drinking Cup-a-Soup with Dad

21:27.080 --> 21:29.435
and trying not to kill Mum.

21:36.080 --> 21:39.152
I can't believe I'm
actually here with you.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.437
Why?
Hmm?

21:42.520 --> 21:43.839
Why?

21:50.520 --> 21:54.559
When we were at university,
before we spoke even,

22:00.080 --> 22:01.069
I had a crush on you.

22:01.760 --> 22:04.832
Ridiculous, I know.

22:04.920 --> 22:09.710
But when we almost

22:09.800 --> 22:11.597
did it that night,

22:13.760 --> 22:15.557
I couldn't believe it.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.875
I wrote poems and everything.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.351
What have you
got to say to that?

22:23.440 --> 22:25.635
Well, I already knew.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.676
What do you mean, you knew?

22:30.760 --> 22:32.796
Well, I sort of guessed.

22:32.880 --> 22:37.431
All those epic letters
and compilation tapes.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.192
So, go on then.
What happened?

22:40.280 --> 22:41.508
Mmm.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.319
I got to know you.
You cured me of you.

22:46.880 --> 22:50.714
I'd still like to read those poems.
What rhymes with Dexter?

22:50.800 --> 22:53.268
Prick. It's a half-rhyme.

22:56.440 --> 22:59.000
Too much wine. We should go.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.992
No, no, no.
Not yet. Not yet.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.389
Listen, let's go for a walk.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.594
So this is it.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.272
It's lovely.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.112
Hello? What's going on here?

23:17.200 --> 23:19.509
Well, I thought we'd go for
a quick swim. Sober us up.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.433
Ah, I get it. I get it.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.397
I've walked right
into it, haven't I?

23:24.480 --> 23:28.996
You get a girl drunk and lead
her to a large body of water.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.355
Oh, come on, Em.
Be spontaneous.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.079
Be reckless.
Live for the moment!

23:41.320 --> 23:43.072
Come on, Em. Get in!

23:43.160 --> 23:44.434
No!

23:44.520 --> 23:48.433
You're such a prude.
Why are you such a prude?

23:48.520 --> 23:50.158
Look, come on!

23:53.000 --> 23:55.275
You could at least
leave your underpants on.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.839
Rule number three, remember?

23:56.920 --> 23:58.399
Come on.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.277
So this is skinny-dipping?

24:24.400 --> 24:28.871
What am I meant to do? Sort of
lark about? Splash you or something?

24:38.560 --> 24:41.870
That's a very serious face.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.035
You're not having a wee, are you?

24:43.120 --> 24:44.473
No.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.837
No, I just wanted to say that

24:53.840 --> 24:55.114
I felt the same.

24:57.240 --> 25:00.471
After our near-miss.

25:00.600 --> 25:04.479
I mean, I didn't write poems
or anything. I'm not insane.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.395
But, you know,
I thought about you.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.751
I think about you.

25:12.560 --> 25:13.993
You and me.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.593
Really?

25:17.320 --> 25:20.596
Really? Okay, well...

25:22.480 --> 25:23.913
Dex...

25:25.440 --> 25:27.749
The problem is I fancy
pretty much everyone.

25:30.240 --> 25:32.629
Oh. I see.
I mean anyone.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.433
Really, I mean, it's like I've just
got out of prison, all the time.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.397
It's a real problem.
I can imagine.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.948
Yeah, and this thing with Ingrid,
it's a sex thing.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.235
It's just sex,
sex, sex, sex, sex.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.629
The point's been made, Dex.

25:44.720 --> 25:48.269
But me and you,
it would be different.

25:53.800 --> 25:57.031
I think we'd want
different things,

25:57.120 --> 25:59.588
and I don't think
I'm ready, you know.

25:59.680 --> 26:03.309
If you wanted to,
you know, have a bit of fun,

26:04.360 --> 26:06.828
holiday fling,
no obligations.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.032
Oh, God. I'll take that
as a no then, shall I?

26:19.120 --> 26:20.394
I think so. I think
our moment's passed.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.119
Come on, I'm not
expressing myself clearly.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.031
No, no, you are, Dex.
That's the problem.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.519
You're worried I might care.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.673
Hey! Hey, Come back here!

26:29.760 --> 26:32.115
Come back, you little... Hey!

26:32.200 --> 26:35.556
Thieves!
Come back. Come back here.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.119
Wait!

26:37.240 --> 26:39.993
They've stolen my clothes!
You little...

26:44.400 --> 26:47.392
Will someone call the police?
Wait! Come back!

26:48.840 --> 26:52.389
Could you please stop laughing
and do something to help?

26:55.360 --> 26:57.396
Armani, that suit was.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.155
The little frogs even
took my underpants.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.229
Armani?

27:01.320 --> 27:02.469
No, Calvin Klein.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.073
Oh, Dex, I'm so sorry.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.713
Little French bastards!

27:05.800 --> 27:07.631
They took your
plimsolls, too.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.473
They're not plimsolls. I've
never worn plimsolls in my life.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.471
They were penny loafers,
and I bloody loved them!

27:13.960 --> 27:17.191
What? It's not funny.
I'm a victim of crime here.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.234
Dex?

27:21.400 --> 27:22.549
What?

27:24.280 --> 27:27.158
Your Calvin Klein underpants.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.992
I'll find them.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.674
I swear to you,
I shall track them down.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.990
Go to sleep.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.989
I wonder how many
rules we broke.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.911
All of them.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.313
Except Scrabble.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.992
Tomorrow, maybe.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.557
Who says quality TV is dead?

28:15.640 --> 28:17.358
Plenty more of this when we
come back  after the break,

28:17.440 --> 28:18.475
so do not go away.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.154
I'm warning you.
We know where you live.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.798
Go on, get out of here.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.958
Look, I just called,
all right, to let you know

28:43.080 --> 28:45.833
that you are the best
friend I've ever had.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.474
I'm touched, Dex, but you're
off your face. And?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.437
Look, it's 5:00 in
the morning. Go home.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.717
And you have
an incredible body.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.279
Dex!

28:55.360 --> 28:56.509
Is that Dexter?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.399
Just promise me
you'll go home, please?

28:58.480 --> 29:00.232
I will, I will, I will,
I will, I will, I will.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.833
Dex, you have work
in the morning. Dex...

29:01.960 --> 29:03.393
Look, good night, all right?

29:03.480 --> 29:08.076
Remember, you are absolutely,
truly amazing.

29:09.760 --> 29:12.399
Dexter? Dex?

29:15.320 --> 29:16.912
You're amazing

29:18.160 --> 29:19.912
and famous.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.638
I'm not that famous.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.956
Aye, aye.
How are you, old man?

30:39.480 --> 30:44.235
Your mother's upstairs. She's
been waiting all morning for you.

30:46.720 --> 30:50.190
Good God, why are
you sweating like that?

30:51.440 --> 30:53.351
Well, it's a hot day.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.635
No, it's not.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.676
Look, how is she?

30:57.760 --> 31:00.354
Well, why don't you go and see?

31:06.120 --> 31:07.348
Mum?

31:25.320 --> 31:27.038
Hello, hello.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.552
Hello, stranger.

31:32.560 --> 31:35.632
Look, I've got a present for you here.

31:35.720 --> 31:38.188
It's not from me.
It's from Emma.

31:38.760 --> 31:39.954
Here, let me.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.274
Thank you.

31:50.480 --> 31:53.199
Oh, how lovely.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.874
A little ambitious maybe.

31:55.960 --> 31:59.316
You might want to push her
towards short stories in the future.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.277
Mum, don't.

32:07.760 --> 32:11.469
So what have you been up to?

32:21.600 --> 32:24.353
I'm Dexter Mayhew. what a show
we've got for you tonight.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.431
we've got a man who claims...

32:26.560 --> 32:27.993
I'll skip this next bit.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.432
There's an interview
that's pretty good.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.870
Perhaps I'll watch it later.

32:41.680 --> 32:45.195
The live show is
always a bit patchy.

32:46.120 --> 32:48.475
I don't understand why you
have to use that voice,

32:48.560 --> 32:51.711
but then I suppose I just don't
care for this sort of thing.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.916
It's just a bit
of fun for kids.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.235
They just watch it
after the pub.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.719
You mean I'm not drunk enough?

32:57.880 --> 32:59.313
No, it's not that.

32:59.400 --> 33:02.233
You know, honestly, Dexter.
Dancing girls in cages.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.276
Is this what it's come to?

33:04.360 --> 33:05.713
I just host it.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.472
It's a means to an end, that's all.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.834
But to what end?

33:08.920 --> 33:11.115
We always said you could
do anything you wanted.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.839
Fine. What do you
want me to do?

33:13.920 --> 33:15.751
Something good.
It is good.

33:15.840 --> 33:20.072
I just do what I'm told.
Look, this is what I can do.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.317
I'm sorry.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.994
The medication makes me ratty.

33:33.080 --> 33:37.437
I just need a little lie-down.
I'll be better tonight.

33:37.520 --> 33:39.909
Yeah, you know, um...

33:40.000 --> 33:43.834
Actually, I've got
this premiere thingy tonight.

33:43.920 --> 33:48.152
Look, I'm sorry. I can't miss it.
It's Jurassic Park.

33:55.720 --> 33:58.632
I'm afraid I'm going
to need some help.

34:02.880 --> 34:05.633
Are you all right?
Here, put your arm around me.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.597
All right.
All right?

34:12.920 --> 34:13.875
Are you all right?

34:13.960 --> 34:14.949
Yes.

34:44.280 --> 34:48.273
Can I get you anything?
Water? Dry martini?

35:18.840 --> 35:20.239
What time is it?

35:20.360 --> 35:21.873
Quarter past 6:00.

35:23.240 --> 35:25.037
Yeah, I must have dozed off.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.951
I'm afraid you've missed our day.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.998
Your father's a little
angry with you.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.594
Look, I'll stay tonight.

35:32.720 --> 35:35.188
No. You go.

35:35.320 --> 35:39.871
No pleasure for me watching you
and your father snarling at each other.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.996
Can I speak frankly?

35:44.120 --> 35:45.314
Do you have to?

35:45.400 --> 35:47.118
I think it's my prerogative.

35:48.920 --> 35:55.155
I know that you're going to be a
fine man. Decent, loving, accomplished.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.515
But I don't think
you're there yet.

35:57.600 --> 36:01.513
And right now, well, I worry

36:05.160 --> 36:07.754
that you're not
very nice anymore.

36:13.280 --> 36:14.838
Well, there's
nothing I can say to that.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.070
There is nothing you have to.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.559
I'm not going to
argue with you.

36:29.640 --> 36:32.393
You can come and collect your
car when you're sober.

36:32.480 --> 36:36.359
You're being ridiculous. I mean,
you cannot confiscate my car key.

36:36.440 --> 36:39.159
Do not dare to
insult my intelligence!

36:40.120 --> 36:42.634
Now your mother loves you very much.
You know that.

36:42.760 --> 36:45.672
But for whatever time
she has left to her...

36:50.160 --> 36:55.917
If you ever, ever come to see
your mother in this state again,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.195
I will not let you
in the house.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.629
I will close the door
in your face. Now...

37:03.840 --> 37:04.829
Go.

37:06.480 --> 37:07.754
Fine.

37:22.480 --> 37:26.871
You're not there. I just remembered
you're on a hot date tonight.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.877
I'm too late.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.918
Okay, can you call me
when you get this?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.434
It's just I need
to speak to someone.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.159
Not someone. You.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.914
A chainsaw for an arm.
It was mad.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.353
It's a work of
timeless beauty.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.749
It's the finest of
the trilogy, methinks.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.673
And I still understood it without seeing
Evil Dead I or Evil Dead II.

37:51.760 --> 37:55.116
My only complaint would be that
there wasn't enough violence.

37:55.200 --> 37:59.079
You didn't mind, did you? Or did you
want to see Three Colors: Blue?

37:59.160 --> 38:02.709
I'm gonna skip a starter
because I had those nachos,

38:02.840 --> 38:06.799
but you go ahead. You can
have anything you like.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.833
Anything up to
the value of, say, £ 14.00?

38:11.720 --> 38:14.314
No, no, seriously,
no, have anything.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.516
Well, you know,
within reason.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.594
It's just so good
to see you again.

38:22.640 --> 38:24.870
And you're going to be
an amazing teacher.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.632
Congratulations.
Thanks.

38:26.720 --> 38:28.836
I wish I'd had more
teachers like you.

38:28.920 --> 38:32.629
Not that I'd have got any
work done. Miss Morley.

38:39.360 --> 38:42.591
You have no new messages.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.555
Comedy's a cruel mistress.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.677
Sometimes, Emma,
I think the only way

38:54.760 --> 38:55.829
I'm going to see
my name up in lights

38:55.920 --> 38:58.639
is if I change it
to Emergency Exit.

38:58.720 --> 39:03.669
Anyway, I'm doing an improvisation
night at the moment.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.398
Mr. Giggles.
Not his real name.

39:05.480 --> 39:08.040
But I think I'm gonna stick to
the more observational material.

39:08.120 --> 39:09.439
I've got this whole
thing at the moment

39:09.520 --> 39:10.839
about the difference
between cats and dogs.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.512
Hey, please stop.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.828
Okay. Do you know
what the hardest thing

39:13.960 --> 39:15.279
about being a stand-up comedian is?

39:15.360 --> 39:16.759
Is it the clothes?

39:16.880 --> 39:18.279
Very good. No.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.031
It's that people expect you
to be on all the time.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.509
Because if you're not being funny,
then what are you being?

39:23.600 --> 39:24.953
Ian, it's not a performance.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.918
Except it sort of is,
though, isn't it?

39:30.400 --> 39:34.029
I've been so excited about
seeing you. Like nervous.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.715
I'm sorry, I...

39:43.800 --> 39:45.028
I'm no good at
this stuff, either.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.873
It's just I graduated today.

39:47.960 --> 39:52.078
I'm finally, actually qualified
to do something useful,

39:52.200 --> 39:54.953
and I wanted to
celebrate with someone.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.354
Was Dexter busy?

40:03.600 --> 40:08.674
Em, when you hear this, can you
just get in a cab? And I'll pay.

40:09.880 --> 40:15.113
Maybe you could even stay over,
you know, on the sofa or something?

40:15.200 --> 40:17.589
I need to just see you.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.558
Please, can you just come over?

40:23.160 --> 40:25.116
Emma Morley?
Hmm?

40:25.200 --> 40:26.519
Can I say something?

40:27.000 --> 40:28.353
Go on.

40:29.760 --> 40:33.992
I think you are
the absolute bollocks.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.310
You, with your honeyed words.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.353
I should probably
head home.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.637
Don't go.
Let's go somewhere else.

40:48.320 --> 40:53.235
I live near, actually. I mean,
it's a dump, like, horrible.

40:53.320 --> 40:57.438
But I've got music and booze.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.953
Or a hot, milky drink
if you prefer.

40:59.880 --> 41:02.678
We could go on
an Ovaltine bender.

41:09.440 --> 41:13.274
All right. Okay.
One, two, three, go!

41:14.720 --> 41:15.675
Which way?

41:15.760 --> 41:17.273
This way, this way,
this way!

41:29.440 --> 41:32.273
That's not needy.
That's just affection.

41:32.360 --> 41:35.352
I've just got
a lot of love to give.

41:39.440 --> 41:43.228
Well, if I can't call you,
can I come and see you?

41:46.600 --> 41:48.158
Do you know where
the matches are?

41:48.240 --> 41:49.355
No.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.557
You might wanna leave it
for a couple of minutes. Go.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.353
Hi, Miss Morley.
Hi.

42:01.440 --> 42:03.351
There gonna be
a showbiz party afterwards

42:03.440 --> 42:06.352
with champagne, and canapés,
and the tinkle of laughter?

42:06.440 --> 42:09.238
It's a school play, Ian. I suspect
we'll be home by half 9:00.

42:09.320 --> 42:12.278
Why don't you stay at mine for a change?
I'll wash my duvet cover.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.153
Is that your boyfriend,
Miss Morley?

42:14.240 --> 42:15.958
Oy! Cheeky.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.918
Greetings, boys and girls.
Welcome to the Late Night Lock In.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.991
Camera one, Dexter.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.957
The show that is late,
live and loud.

42:24.120 --> 42:26.031
Dexter, gentleman to see you.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.075
Mind the cables, sir.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.037
Hey. Okay, ladies.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.953
I helped myself
to tea and buns.

42:36.120 --> 42:37.838
I hope I'm not going
to get you into trouble.

42:38.960 --> 42:40.154
I'm sure it'll be fine.

42:40.280 --> 42:41.395
There he is! Hey!

42:41.480 --> 42:44.870
Doesn't he look gorgeous?
Come to Suki.

42:44.960 --> 42:47.554
Suki Sue. Come here.

42:48.920 --> 42:52.879
I just want to
eat you up.

42:54.800 --> 42:58.998
Suki, actually,
look, this is my father.

42:59.080 --> 43:00.798
Wotcha, Mr. M.

43:00.880 --> 43:03.075
Isn't your son gorgeous?

43:03.160 --> 43:04.559
Um, he's very nice.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.517
And where's Mrs. M?

43:08.280 --> 43:10.669
Sadly, she passed away.

43:13.760 --> 43:16.797
Barry, I need some water.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.393
What an appalling woman.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.948
Actually, she's sort
of my girlfriend.

43:21.040 --> 43:23.349
Oh, well, congratulations.

43:25.800 --> 43:29.349
Your mother would have
been most impressed.

43:31.960 --> 43:33.109
Thanks, Dad.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.350
I'll be watching at home
if I can stay awake.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.958
Have fun

43:39.040 --> 43:41.474
and don't take any notice of
what they say in the papers.

43:41.560 --> 43:43.790
Okay, sir. If you'd
like to come this way.

43:43.880 --> 43:44.995
Please.

43:46.440 --> 43:48.590
I'm the king of
car crash television.

43:48.680 --> 43:50.033
But you're the king of it.
That's good.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.236
Caption under photo. "Odious."

43:53.240 --> 43:54.593
why can't you come again?

43:54.720 --> 43:56.039
Because I'm working.

43:56.120 --> 43:58.031
I'll send a car to
come and pick you up.

43:58.200 --> 44:00.111
Dex, I can't.

44:00.240 --> 44:03.994
I know, and I'm sorry. I'm just so
much better when you're around.

44:04.120 --> 44:05.599
Look, I'm just worried
I'm gonna be

44:05.720 --> 44:07.233
stood in front of
the camera thinking,

44:07.320 --> 44:08.799
"What's the bloody point?"

44:08.880 --> 44:11.189
The show's ridiculous.
I'm such a fraud, Em.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.396
Hey, come on. That's enough.

44:13.480 --> 44:16.074
You know what you're doing.
You'll be fine.

44:16.160 --> 44:17.149
Right.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.993
Just don't speak
in that weird voice, okay?

44:20.080 --> 44:22.116
Okay.
All right. Bye.

44:24.760 --> 44:25.988
Get ready. Here we go.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.832
Great stuff.
Let's move. Let's move!

44:27.920 --> 44:29.273
Okay, come on, guys. Let's go.

44:29.920 --> 44:31.990
We're on, superstar.

44:46.120 --> 44:49.590
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Late Night Lock In.

44:49.680 --> 44:51.591
The show that is late, live...

44:51.760 --> 44:53.671
And loud!

44:53.760 --> 44:55.910
And what a show
we've got for you tonight.

44:58.440 --> 44:59.919
Yay!

45:02.280 --> 45:04.157
Well done, darling.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.269
Thank you.

45:06.360 --> 45:08.396
Come on, Miss Morley.

45:08.480 --> 45:09.833
Bravo!

45:20.120 --> 45:23.237
The Maxi Crew, ladies and gentlemen.
The Maxi Crew.

45:23.320 --> 45:27.598
All right, take a seat, fellas.
Take a seat. You can sit down there.

45:27.680 --> 45:32.470
Right, guys, I just wanna start by
saying that that jam was fresh.

45:32.560 --> 45:36.189
Right, okay, so let's kick it off with...
Let's ask some questions.

45:36.280 --> 45:39.829
what is hip hop? Is this the
voice from the street?

45:39.920 --> 45:42.992
Is this why you guys
are just so angry?

45:43.080 --> 45:44.274
No, dawg.

45:44.360 --> 45:45.998
It's chill,
it's chill, it's chill.

45:48.800 --> 45:52.509
Right, okay. Listen,
can you rap about anything?

45:52.600 --> 45:55.068
For example, could you rap
about a cheese sandwich?

45:55.160 --> 45:58.118
Are you new here?
Have you done this before?

45:59.760 --> 46:03.150
Oh, dear.
Do not try this at home.

46:08.520 --> 46:09.509
Ian?

46:09.840 --> 46:11.273
Do you think you'll
finish painting today?

46:11.360 --> 46:13.874
I'd like to at least
get the TV back inside.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.833
All right, all right.
I can have breakfast first, can't I?

46:16.960 --> 46:18.075
We've had breakfast.

46:18.160 --> 46:20.549
All right, brunch, then.

46:20.640 --> 46:22.870
Brunch. Is it lunch?
Is it breakfast?

46:23.000 --> 46:25.195
No, it's brunch.
What about brinner, say?

46:25.280 --> 46:26.872
Or brupper?

46:26.960 --> 46:28.473
Well, I should get on.

46:28.600 --> 46:30.158
Bearhug, snootch?

46:30.240 --> 46:32.071
I thought we agreed
about snootch?

46:32.160 --> 46:35.709
I can't seem to say anything
right these days, can I?

46:36.720 --> 46:38.472
Look, if you don't
want me to go tonight...

46:38.600 --> 46:40.318
No, you should go.

46:40.440 --> 46:41.953
Or if you wanted
to come with us...

46:42.040 --> 46:44.634
What? Dexter ignoring me, and you
talking over me? No, thank you.

46:44.720 --> 46:45.755
It won't be like that.

46:45.880 --> 46:46.949
Anyway, I've got a gig tonight

46:47.040 --> 46:48.996
at The Rose & Crown,
Sir Laffalots.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.151
Paid gig?

46:51.240 --> 46:52.389
No.

46:52.560 --> 46:53.709
Better get back to it then.

46:53.800 --> 46:56.155
Thirty-four identical essays
on Lord of the Flies.

46:56.240 --> 47:01.917
Em? About 1 700 hours, do you
fancy a little bit of the old...

47:02.880 --> 47:05.235
You know, afternoon delight?

47:23.200 --> 47:24.349
Wow!

47:25.040 --> 47:26.598
You look incredible.

47:26.680 --> 47:28.352
Oh... Ooh!

47:28.440 --> 47:30.317
Let's see the dress.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.035
Is it vintage?

47:33.160 --> 47:34.195
No, it's brand new.

47:34.280 --> 47:35.679
Really?
Mmm.

47:35.760 --> 47:38.069
Well, you look great,
and I love the shoes.

47:38.160 --> 47:41.550
Thank you. It's the world's
first orthopedic high heel.

47:41.640 --> 47:44.234
Look, it's been too long, Em.

47:44.320 --> 47:47.630
I need to have some fun tonight.
Can we have fun, please?

47:47.760 --> 47:48.954
God, sorry.

47:50.800 --> 47:51.949
Look, I'll be two seconds.
It's work.

47:52.040 --> 47:53.155
I'm naked!

47:53.240 --> 47:54.434
Suki, you nutter.

47:54.600 --> 47:55.749
where are you, baby?

47:55.840 --> 47:57.558
I thought you were supposed
to be at the party.

47:58.440 --> 48:00.476
You do know they
damage your brain?

48:00.600 --> 48:02.556
They do not damage
your brain.

48:02.640 --> 48:04.119
How can you tell?

48:04.280 --> 48:05.793
Ha ha, very funny, Em.

48:05.880 --> 48:08.440
I guarantee you, one year, one year,
and you'll have one of these.

48:08.520 --> 48:12.399
You're on. If I ever get a mobile phone,
you can buy me dinner.

48:12.480 --> 48:14.471
What, again?

48:15.680 --> 48:19.309
So, come on.
How's the king of comedy?

48:19.400 --> 48:21.595
Oh, Ian's fine.
We both are.

48:21.680 --> 48:23.318
Are you still
very much in love?

48:23.400 --> 48:27.234
He can belch the theme to The A-Team.
I'm only flesh and blood.

48:27.320 --> 48:30.551
I don't know. These days,
we don't seem to...

48:30.640 --> 48:33.438
And how's the new place?
How's that?

48:33.520 --> 48:37.308
Flat's fine. Well, it's a room
and a half in murder mile.

48:37.400 --> 48:38.958
And Ian's been
talking about painting

48:39.040 --> 48:40.917
the same wall
for the past six months.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.675
But it's got potential. There's a view.
The Gasworks.

48:46.520 --> 48:48.238
You should come round.

48:48.360 --> 48:49.839
Mmm! Mmm.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.638
How's Suki?

48:55.720 --> 48:57.915
Oh, she's fantastic.
Yeah, gorgeous.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.309
What's great for me is that she
really understands the industry.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.789
You know, she knows exactly
what it's like to be...

49:04.520 --> 49:07.239
I was gonna say "famous."
God, we hate the word.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.878
Every time I turn on the telly,

49:08.960 --> 49:10.439
she's there in
a pink rubber catsuit.

49:10.520 --> 49:12.238
She's doing incredibly well.

49:12.360 --> 49:14.112
Yeah, yeah.

49:14.200 --> 49:16.031
Well, we both are.

49:16.880 --> 49:20.156
I've got some really, really
exciting stuff coming up.

49:20.240 --> 49:21.912
It's all sort of in development.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.116
If I told you,
I'd have to shoot you.

49:24.200 --> 49:25.599
Please do.

49:27.560 --> 49:31.030
Never mind.
Start without me, all right?

49:47.560 --> 49:48.549
Hello.

49:48.640 --> 49:50.596
There you are. Enjoy.

49:50.680 --> 49:52.750
What are you doing,
you silly thing?

49:52.920 --> 49:54.956
Well, listen,
we'll talk later.

49:57.880 --> 50:00.189
Look at this.
This looks gorgeous.

50:00.280 --> 50:02.111
Are you all right?
Maybe she could join us?

50:02.200 --> 50:06.273
Hey, hey, hey, what's this?
I'm here to see you, remember?

50:06.360 --> 50:09.238
Right, well,
how's the teaching?

50:09.360 --> 50:11.794
What? If you're not
interested, don't ask.

50:11.880 --> 50:13.438
I am interested.

50:13.520 --> 50:15.875
I just thought you were going to
be writing this novel, that's all.

50:15.960 --> 50:18.076
And I will.
But I have to earn a living.

50:18.200 --> 50:20.589
More to the point, I enjoy it.
I'm a bloody good teacher, Dexter.

50:20.680 --> 50:23.035
I'm sure you are.

50:23.120 --> 50:24.439
Still, you know what they say?

50:24.520 --> 50:26.033
No, what do they say?

50:26.120 --> 50:28.350
You know, "Those who can..."

50:28.440 --> 50:32.592
No, I'm sorry. I'm not familiar.
Finish the sentence.

50:34.080 --> 50:37.231
All right.
Well, "Those who can, do,

50:37.320 --> 50:40.118
"and those who can't, teach."

50:42.800 --> 50:45.917
And those who can teach say,
"Go fuck yourself!"

50:47.640 --> 50:50.677
Em! Em, come on. Look, whatever
I've done, I'm sorry.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.273
You've obviously
had a bit too much to drink.

50:52.400 --> 50:54.197
No, you're drunk!
You're drunk!

50:54.320 --> 50:58.074
Do you realize that I have literally
not seen you sober for three years?

50:58.200 --> 50:59.997
Nipping off to the toilet
every 10 minutes.

51:00.080 --> 51:01.877
Either you're on coke,
or you've got dysentery.

51:01.960 --> 51:04.838
Either way, it's boring! Banging on
about yourself all the time.

51:04.920 --> 51:08.833
Well, I wouldn't mind, Dex, but
you're a TV presenter, all right?

51:08.960 --> 51:10.279
You've not invented penicillin.

51:10.360 --> 51:12.271
All you do is stand around shouting,
"Make some noise!"

51:12.360 --> 51:14.476
Look, I am having fun,
that's all.

51:14.640 --> 51:16.756
I've been through
a lot recently.

51:16.840 --> 51:17.989
I might get
a bit carried away,

51:18.160 --> 51:19.309
but if you wouldn't
stop getting at me...

51:19.400 --> 51:21.550
Am I?
I don't mean to, and I...

51:21.680 --> 51:25.116
I know that you've been through a
lot with your mum and all, I know.

51:25.200 --> 51:29.432
But, there are things that I
needed to talk to you about.

51:29.520 --> 51:33.718
About how I am
stuck in this flat

51:33.800 --> 51:35.358
with a man that I am
not in love with.

51:35.440 --> 51:39.752
And if I can't talk to you, then
what is the point of you? Of us?

51:39.840 --> 51:41.398
What do you mean,
"What's the point?"

51:41.520 --> 51:43.112
I think we've outgrown each other.

51:43.200 --> 51:46.476
No, you have outgrown me. You
think I'm uncool and dreary.

51:46.560 --> 51:48.391
I don't think
you're dreary. Em...

51:48.480 --> 51:53.110
I think if it's over, then we should
just face facts. Say goodbye.

51:53.200 --> 51:54.679
It sounds like you're dumping me.

51:54.840 --> 51:56.273
Yeah, maybe I am.

51:56.360 --> 51:58.078
You're not who you used to be.

51:58.160 --> 52:01.197
Come on, Em.
Look, I apologize!

52:02.480 --> 52:03.879
Please.

52:10.040 --> 52:12.076
Come on. That's it.

52:14.040 --> 52:15.473
There.

52:17.200 --> 52:21.239
I love you, Dexter. So much.

52:24.040 --> 52:26.713
I just don't like you anymore.

52:27.160 --> 52:29.310
I'm sorry.

53:04.880 --> 53:06.916
Johnny Cage wins.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.833
That's an almighty win
from the Blade Cruisers there.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.434
I think you'll all agree.
Well done, guys.

53:12.520 --> 53:15.876
That's all from tonight's Joy Stick Jockeys.
Join us next week

53:15.960 --> 53:19.794
when we review the smoking
hot new console games coming at you.

53:19.880 --> 53:23.111
Until then, night owls, keep gaming.

53:27.880 --> 53:30.952
Do I really have to
say "smoking hot"?

53:32.680 --> 53:35.513
It's just I'm 32,
for God's sake.

53:37.400 --> 53:39.118
What, they're sacking me?

53:39.200 --> 53:41.475
You see, sack has
negative connotations.

53:41.560 --> 53:44.518
It's just they wanna
try a new presenter.

53:45.640 --> 53:47.153
So they are sacking me?

53:47.240 --> 53:49.276
Well, no, they're taking the
show in a different direction,

53:49.360 --> 53:52.591
but it's a direction
away from you.

53:52.680 --> 53:54.033
Okay, so less you now.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.075
Okay.

53:55.160 --> 53:56.957
More you in your 20s.

53:59.640 --> 54:01.915
Right. Right.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.956
So, what's the good news?

54:04.040 --> 54:06.110
Sorry?

54:06.200 --> 54:10.478
Well, you said you had some bad news.
What's the good news?

54:17.160 --> 54:19.594
Every career has
its ups and downs.

54:19.720 --> 54:22.109
This is just a bloody great down.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.918
And I sense a bit of
disenchantment, Dexy.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.230
Just a little concerned
about my future.

54:26.320 --> 54:29.073
It's not quite
what I was expecting.

54:29.200 --> 54:33.352
The future never is. That's what
makes it so bloody exciting!

54:35.000 --> 54:37.116
Everyone loves you, yeah?

54:37.200 --> 54:41.398
But they love you in that ironic,
love-to-hate kind of way.

54:41.480 --> 54:43.072
Right?
And all that we need to do

54:43.160 --> 54:45.515
is just find someone
that loves you for real.

54:48.040 --> 54:49.678
Okay?
Yeah.

54:54.440 --> 54:56.032
I love you, Sylvie.

54:57.040 --> 55:00.316
No, no, wait.
No, I'm in love with you.

55:00.440 --> 55:03.591
Look, I've never said
this to anyone before.

55:03.680 --> 55:05.432
Well, that's a lie. Um...

55:07.160 --> 55:09.230
I love you, Sylvie. I...

55:12.240 --> 55:16.028
Sylvie tells me you used
to be quite well known.

55:16.120 --> 55:17.792
TV presenter or something.

55:17.880 --> 55:20.758
I did. Yeah.
Once upon a time.

55:20.840 --> 55:24.515
Yes, on Larginit. That program.
Do you remember, Mummy?

55:24.600 --> 55:25.828
You used to really hate it.

55:25.920 --> 55:26.909
Yes.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.592
"Turn it off," she used to say.

55:28.720 --> 55:31.029
"Turn it off. It's
killing your brain cells."

55:31.120 --> 55:32.792
That was you, was it?

55:32.880 --> 55:34.552
You still work
in television, Dexter?

55:34.640 --> 55:38.519
Not so much, no. That sort
of drifted away, really.

55:38.600 --> 55:39.635
Uh-huh.

55:39.720 --> 55:42.917
Dexter's just being modest.
He gets lots of offers.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.831
Anyway, what he really
wants to do is produce.

55:48.440 --> 55:49.759
Party games.

55:53.200 --> 55:54.553
Are you there, Moriarty?

55:54.680 --> 55:56.079
Here.

55:57.440 --> 55:58.589
Two for two,
nice work, bro.

55:58.680 --> 55:59.669
Going for a hat trick.

55:59.760 --> 56:01.990
Are you there, Moriarty?

56:02.080 --> 56:03.229
Here.

56:07.280 --> 56:08.599
The crowd goes wild!

56:09.800 --> 56:11.438
There's my boy!

56:11.520 --> 56:12.839
Better luck next time, son.
Thank you.

56:12.920 --> 56:15.434
Well, I'm still
very proud of you.

56:17.120 --> 56:18.633
Oh, isn't this fun?

56:18.720 --> 56:20.870
Dexter, care to take me on?
Oh, no.

56:20.960 --> 56:21.995
That's a terrific idea.

56:22.080 --> 56:23.069
Darling, are you sure?

56:23.160 --> 56:24.798
Yes, I'm sure.

56:25.240 --> 56:27.037
Come on, chap.
Pick up your weapon.

56:27.120 --> 56:29.190
Nice and tight, Mum.

56:31.400 --> 56:32.753
All right?
All right.

56:32.880 --> 56:35.394
Very good. We don't
want you cheating.

56:35.480 --> 56:37.391
Good luck.
All right.

56:37.480 --> 56:39.357
Come on, sis.

56:45.440 --> 56:48.238
All right, ready?

56:48.320 --> 56:49.833
As ready as I'll...

56:49.920 --> 56:53.708
Good God, man! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

56:53.840 --> 56:55.637
That table was from Italy.
I'm so sorry.

56:55.720 --> 56:57.950
I must have just caught her
at a funny angle there.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.838
You didn't even ask
if she was there, Moriarty.

57:00.920 --> 57:04.833
I know. I know. I'm so sorry. Look,
I don't know what I was thinking.

57:04.920 --> 57:06.353
Wanker!

57:18.800 --> 57:21.189
Serves me right
for not changing the locks.

57:21.280 --> 57:22.429
Looking good, Ian.

57:22.560 --> 57:23.754
You can get stuffed, Emma.

57:23.840 --> 57:24.795
Is that from your act?

57:24.920 --> 57:27.957
No, though I have got this new
thingI've been working on.

57:28.040 --> 57:29.314
God.

57:29.400 --> 57:32.437
I come on, and I say,
"Here's a funny story. You'll like this."

57:32.520 --> 57:34.795
Ian.
"There's this guy,

57:34.880 --> 57:38.270
"and he's going out with this girl,
and he worships her,

57:38.360 --> 57:40.828
"and they buy
this flat together.

57:40.920 --> 57:43.753
"And then he gets her
an engagement ring, the lot.

57:43.840 --> 57:48.675
"It turns out that she is still
in love with her best friend."

57:48.760 --> 57:51.911
Interesting theory, Ian, except
I've not seen Dexter for ages.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.718
No?
That is not the reason.

57:53.800 --> 57:58.749
Do you know how he found out about it?
He read it in her poetry.

57:58.840 --> 58:00.159
You bastard!

58:00.240 --> 58:02.151
Give it back to me!
"Our graduation night!

58:02.240 --> 58:04.276
"The erotic intensity
of the shared bed."

58:04.360 --> 58:07.318
"That magic week in France."
It's all here in blank verse.

58:07.400 --> 58:09.994
If you ever, ever, come in
here again I will call the police!

58:10.080 --> 58:11.672
Call the bloody police!
It's my flat, too!

58:11.800 --> 58:13.950
Is it? I paid the mortgage!

58:14.040 --> 58:17.510
You just sat around farting and
watching the bloody wrath of Khan!

58:17.600 --> 58:18.794
You love The wrath of Khan.

58:18.880 --> 58:21.599
I hate The wrath of Khan.

58:25.560 --> 58:28.233
It's a good job
we didn't get married.

58:31.320 --> 58:33.834
I'm sorry about going
through all your stuff.

58:33.920 --> 58:36.514
I've just been a bit mad
recently, that's all.

58:36.600 --> 58:38.352
It's all right.

58:41.200 --> 58:43.191
I miss you.

58:43.280 --> 58:44.554
I know you do.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.631
Like, right here.

58:50.760 --> 58:53.672
Either that, or it's trapped wind.
I'm not sure.

58:53.800 --> 58:55.870
Either way, it'll pass.

58:55.960 --> 58:57.916
It's good, by the way.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.514
Not the poems.
The poems are awful,

59:00.640 --> 59:04.553
but the rest of the stuff,
the stories. You're funny.

59:04.640 --> 59:06.517
Proper funny.

59:06.600 --> 59:07.828
Not like me.
Ian.

59:07.920 --> 59:09.558
No, I'm just saying that you
should show them to someone,

59:09.640 --> 59:12.518
because you're
better than you know.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.194
Oh!

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.835
So that's Emma Morley.
We went to university together.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.148
Did you sleep with her as well?

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.514
No.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.749
What about the bride?

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.717
No.
God, what is this?

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.316
It's just that every weekend
we go to a wedding

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.994
with a coachload of people
that you've slept with.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.399
It's like a conference.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.748
Okay. Come on.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.478
You know you're the
only one for me now.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.279
You are. Come on,
come here. Come here.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.988
Hummus wraps.
Organic smoothies.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.832
Fair Trade coffees.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:15.269
Crayfish. Dex, people go crazy
for the little buggers.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.669
I've got 12 branches already.
Twelve more by the end of the year.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.273
Well, you know,
there's a rumor going around

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:23.998
that you're actually
a multi millionaire.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.792
Come on.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.312
Well, define multi.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.959
You should come and have lunch.
We should talk.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.439
What, are you
offering me a job?

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.993
No, I'm just saying...

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.514
You are, aren't you?
You're offering me a job.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.034
Look, I haven't seen you
on telly for a while.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.076
I thought if you
wanted a fresh start...

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.156
Callum, mate.
Mate, mate, mate.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.277
At university, you wore
the same pair of jeans for...

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.316
What was it, four years?

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.277
Long time ago now, pal.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.552
We're not students anymore.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.868
Someone seems
to be enjoying it.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.109
Look, look over here.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.758
Have you seen Emma Morley?

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.400
Right under our noses
all this time. Eh?

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.593
Who knew?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.117
I sit and wait

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.317
Does an angel

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.756
Contemplate my fate

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.508
Do they know

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.717
I tell you, the one discovery
changed my life.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.830
Crayfish.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.957
I've got 12 branches already.
Another 12 by the end of the year.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.996
I was telling Dexter there's
plenty of opportunities.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.389
Darling, I'll be back in a bit.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.919
Do you want some champagne?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.389
It's not champagne.
It's Spanish.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.470
when I'm lying in my bed

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.472
Thoughts running
through my head

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.358
And I feel that love is dead

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.956
I'm loving angels instead

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.155
Do you want to
get out of here?

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.389
Yes, please.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:09.156
And through it all
She offers me protection

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.754
A lot of love and affection

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:16.193
Today must be quite tough for you,
having slept with the bride.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.154
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.550
What? How do you
know all these things?

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.471
Tilly told me all about it.
Oh, did she?

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:28.518
The foot massage
spun out of control.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.194
I think you even
used my olive oil.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.953
Footprints halfway
up the kitchen wall.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.439
Well, that stuff's
behind me now, so...

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.839
Really, what happened?

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.599
Sex in toilet cubicles
lose its bittersweet charm?

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.274
Well, an orgy won't keep you
warm at night, Emma.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.191
An orgy won't look after you
when you're old.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.599
Well said.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.077
Anyway, I screwed up my career.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.230
And screwed up things with Mum.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.795
That's not true.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.069
And I screwed up my friendships.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.589
And then Sylvie
just came along.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.638
And she sort of,
well, saved me, really.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.876
She's very beautiful.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.599
Of course, she has absolutely
no sense of humor.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.794
Just as well. A sense of
humor's overrated.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.036
Goofing around all the time.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.270
The only time Ian
ever really made me laugh

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.873
was when he fell
down the stairs.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.918
Well, you know, Sylvie says
she doesn't like to laugh.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.276
Doesn't really like
what it does to her face.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.556
But you love her, right?

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.437
Yeah, I worship her.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:56.195
I'm loving Colin instead

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:03.029
Oh, no, no. This way.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.473
Where are we going?

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.475
Dex?

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.554
Oh!

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.194
So, come on, then.
You, huh?

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.077
Any romance?

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.639
Don't start, Dex.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.709
What?

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.713
Your sympathy.
I'm not lonely. I'm alone.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.552
There, how'd that sound?

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.596
Yeah, yeah.
I bought that.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.908
It's true.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.358
I've got a tiny advance
to write this book.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.194
Em!

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.515
Mmm-hmm.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:46.795
Well, you know, I have
something to tell you, too.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.792
You're getting married.

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.393
Yeah.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.795
So, you're pleased?

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.111
Of course I'm pleased, Dex.
Fantastic news, really.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.631
Scented? Your wedding
invitations are scented.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.631
Yeah, lavender.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.792
No, Dex, it's money.
They smell of money.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.599
August 1 4th?

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.309
Yeah, I think that's what
they call a shotgun wedding.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.556
For 350.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.753
With buffet.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.193
Do you know who the father is?

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.679
Stop it.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.591
I'm kidding.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:51.715
Congratulations.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.789
Thank you.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.438
A dad.
I know.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.436
Is that allowed?
Will they let you?

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.596
It's incredible, isn't it?

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.831
You're going to be
a wonderful father.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.353
Do you really think so?

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.158
I don't doubt it
for a minute.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.837
I missed you, Dex.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.836
Well, I missed you, too.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.311
No more disappearing.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:38.155
No, well, I won't
if you won't.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.913
Mmm?
Mmm.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.829
Dex?

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.998
We should go.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.271
Absolutely, let's go.

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.036
Come on, Jasmine.
Come on.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.994
Come on.
You gonna stop crying?

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.268
How you getting on?

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:40.316
Good, mate.
Good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:41.627
Not quite what
I was expecting, but...

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.749
How do you mean?

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.798
Well, you see the words
organic and homemade...

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.871
Yeah, I know. You imagined
a couple of hippies

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.792
on a little farm somewhere,
knitting their own muesli.

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.871
Nice idea, but this
is business, Dex.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.189
Yeah, well, I realize that.
Here's your last two.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.953
Listen, mate. You're only
here to learn the ropes, okay?

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.553
Company policy.
Everyone has to.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.948
Callum, I'm enjoying it.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.473
Honestly, I'm good.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.912
There's plenty
of formula left.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.395
I've pureed the veggies,
or you could mash a banana.

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:16.154
And what about Indian food?
I can give her a curry, can't I?

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.390
No, no, no, Dexter. No.

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:19.879
Sylvie, I'm joking.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.319
Oh, I see.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:23.231
I keep missing those, don't I?

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:24.992
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm late.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.792
I don't even know why I'm going.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.756
I'm too old for hen nights.
No, you're not.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:29.908
That's my cab.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.149
Right, come on, then.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.559
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.953
Okay.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.871
Be good. Try not to
burn the house down.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.995
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:42.630
Goodbye, my sweetheart.
Say goodbye to Mummy.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.198
Say goodbye to Mummy.

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:47.272
Oh, I know, honey.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.591
Have a good time.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:01.034
Oh! Come on.
We'll be all right, won't we?

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.759
Party started
there's no end in sight

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.434
Everybody's moving
to the rhythm that's inside

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:13.671
It's a crazy world but
tonight's the right situation

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.315
I am Spartacus.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.590
No, I'm Spartacus.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.033
No, I'm Spartacus.
I'm Spartacus.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.395
wahey! Let's have a big hand
and give a round of applause...

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.391
Look, Jas.
Look, that's Daddy's ex.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.550
...for basketball
stars TJ and Mickey D!

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.073
Isn't she loud?

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.879
Can you even fit
them in a two-shot?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.595
They are so tall. I'm practically
melting over here.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.396
Isn't she a loud, loud girl?

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.838
"Julie Criscoll,
aged 15, wanted

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.878
nothing more than
to change the world."

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:55.077
"If only all the politicians
would actually listen."

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.033
Yeah, well that's Em.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.157
Is that Em? Yeah, that's Em.
She wrote the book.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.109
Emma?

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.429
It's me.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.873
I'm so sorry, darling.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.316
Look, how's the party going?
How's it all going?

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.709
Um...

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.956
We're all going on
to some club. How is she?

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.792
Asleep. You know, finally.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.195
She's been awake
all this time?

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.192
Yeah, my fault. I should
have given her the decaf.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.474
See? There you go.
I made you laugh.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.513
Are you all right?

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.870
Yeah.
No, no, I'm good. I'm good.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.109
Why? Were you worried?

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.349
Oh, no. Um...

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.396
No reason. I just...

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.310
Well, I was just
checking up on you and...

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.753
well, everything's fine.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:49.033
All right.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.718
Look, Sylvie,

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.792
I know I'm not good at all this,
you know, dad/husband thing.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:00.309
You're doing fine, Dexter.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.391
No, and I know
if you had a receipt,

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.755
you would have taken
me back a long time ago.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:09.874
But, you know, I'm working on it,
all right? So bear with me. That's all.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.758
I've got to go.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.031
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.076
Night.
Good night.

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:21.875
Funny?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:22.989
Very funny.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.519
Well, look at you.
You even look like a writer.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.151
A writer in Paris.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.191
There's a word for this,
isn't there?

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.077
Uh, butch.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.878
I was gonna say gamine.

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.868
What do you look like?

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.916
Me? A screwed-up divorce.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.274
So my apartment's not far.
Shall we?

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.516
How long are you staying for?

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.672
I suppose it's up to you,
really. It's just...

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.357
Look, I just wanted
to say something

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.232
which I couldn't
really do over the phone.

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.515
Well, ever since we were
last together in London...

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:03.797
Dexter, before you say
anything else, I have to...

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.513
There's something
I have to tell you.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.628
You've met someone!

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.551
Is that really
so hard to believe?

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.471
A man?
Yes, a man. A guy.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.438
A guy! He's a guy now,
is he? I see.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:21.239
He's called Jean-Pierre,
Jean-Pierre Dusollier.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.514
What, he's French?

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.715
No, Dex, he's Welsh.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:29.160
He's handsome. He's charming.
He's just very, very French.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.071
What, you mean rude?

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.718
No.
Arrogant?

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.756
Smokes too much,
wears a string of onions.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.990
Why are you being like this?

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.913
Oh, God, you mean sexy. Is that what
you mean? You're having lots of sex?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.638
Since when do I need
to ask your permission?

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.199
God knows
you never asked mine.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.875
But we just slept together.

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.072
I haven't forgotten.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.835
Dexter, we got a bit drunk.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.512
Yeah, not that drunk.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.471
You took your trousers off
over your shoes.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.079
No, I didn't.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:06.549
Did I?

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.315
I think that you were upset
about Sylvie and the divorce,

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.795
and you needed
a shoulder to cry on.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.438
Or sleep with.

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:18.069
And that's what I was,
a shoulder to sleep with.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.919
And that's why you did it, was it?
To cheer me up.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.149
Well, it worked, didn't it?

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:33.669
If you must know, it was one of
the better nights of my life.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.988
See?

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.558
Don't fish.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.036
Dex, it was one time.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:45.790
Well, it was three times.

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.996
Come on. Look, you don't
think it's a good idea?

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.798
You and me.

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.031
I do. I did.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.235
In the late '80s.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.355
Right.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.073
Better get going.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.553
Why? What are we doing?

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.993
Jean-Pierre wants to meet you.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.394
Oh, you're kidding.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.436
We're going to hear him play.

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:13.555
Play?

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:14.629
He's a jazz musician.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.429
Bastard.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.478
We're going to listen to him play free
jazz on the piano for about nine hours,

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:23.313
and it's going to be lots of
fun and in no way awkward.

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.559
You're not going out
like that, are you?

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.313
Just do me up.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.279
That's Jean-Pierre.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.509
Where?

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:07.873
Oh, God. You could have at least
found someone a bit good-looking.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.112
You know, Em, I'm sure he's
a fine jazz pianist.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.316
I just don't think
I can do this.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.474
Oh. Really?

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:24.076
Yeah, I'll just go and see a movie
and go back to the apartment.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.715
And then I think I'm going to get
the first train back tomorrow.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.074
You don't have to leave.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.514
I think I do.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.591
I'm sorry, Dex.

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.035
Hey, don't be.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.588
Go on.

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.271
Salut.
Hey.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:07.875
Wait! Dexter!

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.956
I thought I got rid of you.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.911
If you muck me about,
Dexter...

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.996
Em, I swear.
I swear I won't.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.270
Lead me on, or let me down,
or go behind my back,

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.509
I will murder you.

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.635
I won't do that.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.159
You swear?

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.916
Yeah, I swear. I swear.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.918
I would like to thank everyone
for coming to our wedding.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.198
For what can only be described
as a whirlwind romance.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.429
Pause for laughter.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:24.718
Seriously, when people ask
how Emma and I first met,

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.752
I tell them that
we grew up together.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.911
Blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.991
You're not going to say,
"Blah, blah, blah," on the day, are you?

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.274
You are not supposed
to be hearing this.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.475
What if I have notes?

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:35.715
Come on, let me see.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.279
No, no.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.555
When we're married, you're
going to have to obey me.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.234
Yeah, I'm sure
that's going to happen.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:46.910
What? Not again?

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.433
You don't mind, do you?

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.033
No, I don't mind.

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:54.752
Although, there are
health and safety issues.

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.710
I could lose my license.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.434
They'll wonder
where we've got to.

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:23.469
Mmm! Mmm.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.677
I can definitely
smell burning.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.675
Hello, hello.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:32.949
Hi, there.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:35.634
Come here, you.
Here we go.

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.678
Do you want to give me a big kiss?
Give me a big kiss.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.512
Go on.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.398
TV between 5:30 and 6:00,
but no more.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.311
And she has to
be in bed by 7:30.

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.311
All right,
do you want to run inside?

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.879
Go see Emma. Good girl.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.234
I'm out here, Jasmine.

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.709
She's loving coming
here at the moment.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.034
Well, good. That's great.

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.759
I'm really pleased for you.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.353
Look, I'd invite you in.
It's just...

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.750
No, it's fine. We've got
to go and see my family.

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.512
Have fun.
Thanks.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.836
In you get,
Moriarty.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.477
Dexter?
Yeah.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.391
I've been thinking.

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.073
So have I.

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:37.190
I want a child
with the man I love.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.792
And if he won't do it,
then I want one with you.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.472
Well, then,
we'd better get started.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.232
I look so tired.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.675
So take some exercise.
Come swimming with me later.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:43.150
No, no, I can't. I've got to
do too much at the cafe.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.832
Fine. Don't.

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:49.755
By the way, in case you're interested,
I'm not pregnant.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.439
Em, how do you know?

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.119
How do you think?

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:57.838
We could try again, though.

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:02.317
Come on, look...
No, no, no, no. Come on.

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:07.119
Look, I'm sorry.
All right?

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.748
No, I am
for taking it out on you.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.914
We're not at our best today,
are we?

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.553
Listen, why don't we meet
each other after work?

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.871
We'll go to the movies.
Your choice.

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:28.871
Something with subtitles.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.319
Ooh.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.914
And we can go and have
some dinner. Just you and me,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.993
and we can work this out.
All right?

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.433
I promise.
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:40.913
Yeah.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.149
Okay.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.871
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:36.756
Hey, there. Just to say I'm running late,
but I'm on my way.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.752
I'm sorry for being
so snappy this morning.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:36.514
Hey, there. Just to say I'm
running late, but I'm on my way.

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:41.076
And I'm sorry for being
so snappy this morning.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:44.357
I just wanted to say you're
a fine thing, Dexter Mayhew.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.396
I love you very much.

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:49.074
Okay, there you go. Lucky you!

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.189
Dad.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.152
Dexter?
Hello, darling.

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.358
Jasmine!

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.752
Are you all right?
Go and get dressed.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.279
Sylvie, Sylvie.
Dexter?

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:56.670
Sylvie, Sylvie,
I screwed up.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.829
Jasmine, now!

01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.592
I screwed up.

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:01.312
It's all right.
You're all right.

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.158
No, I screwed up.

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.077
Come on, let's get you up.
Come on.

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.232
I'm so sorry.

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.389
It's all right.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:14.959
Aw, Dex, come on.

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:19.555
You poor thing.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:26.428
Oh, God. Dexter.

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:12.153
As the rain came down,
the water levels began to rise.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:17.837
So is this going to be an
annual festival, do you think?

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.834
Every year, 15th of July?

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.914
Well, I hope not.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.434
I don't want a heart-to-heart.

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:30.949
Do you?

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.759
No, no. I'd rather not.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.594
Except to say, that I think
the best thing that you could do

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:43.796
would be to try to live your
life as if Emma was still here.

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.839
Don't you?

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.109
I don't know if I can.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.553
Of course you can.

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:04.074
What do you think I've been
doing for the past 10 years?

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:17.639
Now Silent witness is on.
9:00.

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:24.233
Right.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:37.999
Ian. God!

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.069
Dexter.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.832
Hi.
Hello, mate.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:43.309
Are you well?
Yeah, look at this.

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:46.835
So, how are you?
How's the stand-up comedy?

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.751
Oh, well,
I gave that up, actually.

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:49.915
That's a shame.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.515
No, not really,
because I was never any good.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.511
The only time
I ever made Emma laugh

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.068
was when I fell down
the stairs. Really.

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:01.397
No, I'm in insurance now.

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:03.591
Great, great.

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.351
I hate today.
Fifteenth of July.

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.596
Saint Swithin's Day.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.233
It's a tough one.

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:24.316
I never noticed it before, but it was
always there just waiting, lurking.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.031
I used to hate you, too.

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:31.476
Quite violently, actually, Dexter.
No, I'm sorry, but...

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:36.588
Because, she lit up with you.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.951
Just in a way that
she never would with me,

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:45.112
and it used to make me
so angry because...

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:50.238
I didn't think that you deserved her.
Can I say this?

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:52.038
Yeah, go on.

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.878
She made you decent.

01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:01.552
And then in return,
you made her so happy.

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:03.079
So happy.

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:09.557
And I will always be
grateful to you for that.

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:18.269
And on that bombshell,
back to the sticks.

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:20.112
There's my lot out there.
Oh! Look at them.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.958
Yeah, I know.

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.832
So, listen, we'll stay in touch.
I'll give you a call.

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:30.674
No, I don't think that's necessary.
I think we're done here.

01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.354
Come here.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:35.788
Good luck, mate. All right?

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.188
You, too.

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.599
Thank you.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.353
You've got cake
everywhere.

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:52.679
Wake up.

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.279
Wake up.

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:04.472
It's all right.
Don't panic. It's only me.

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.233
Emma. Emma Morley.

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:08.879
Yes. Hello.

01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:12.279
So what do you suggest we do?

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.315
We could stay in touch.

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.437
Today. We're meant
to be doing something today.

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.678
Right. Right, right.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:26.873
Look, today's a bit
tricky for me, really.

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:29.474
No, no, it's not that.
It's just...

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.670
Well, I'm meeting my parents,
and then I've got to get back...

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.513
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you should probably go then.

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:39.954
It was lovely to meet you.
Bye, now.

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:52.200
Look, that's not until later,
so if you wanted to,

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.360
we could go for
a walk or something?

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:01.275
Okay.

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.870
Come on, keep up.

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:20.953
It's these shoes. I can't
mountain climb in brogues.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:25.318
It's not K2. It's just a big hill,
all right? A child could do it.

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:34.159
I don't want you thinking I'm bothered
or anything about last night.

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.233
I don't want your phone number,
or letters, or postcards.

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.072
I don't want to
get married to you.

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:42.549
Definitely don't want
to have your babies.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.473
Whatever happens tomorrow,
we've had today.

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:54.278
And if we should
bump into each other
sometime in the future,

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:56.271
well, that's fine, too.

01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:59.317
We'll be friends.

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:01.397
Yeah, right.

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.797
Or, you know,
on the other hand...

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:14.508
Go on.

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:19.193
Well, my parents
don't arrive until later.

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:22.239
So?

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:25.551
So, well, the flat's empty.

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:30.516
You know, if you wanted
to finish what we started.

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:33.798
What? Sober?

01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.354
Mmm-hmm.

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.198
And in daylight.

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:43.629
Race you!

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:01.992
Do you want a piggy-back,
you old man?

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:06.073
It's these shoes. There's no
blooming grip on these things.

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:07.957
Here, come here, you.

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:13.714
Did you come up
here with Emma?

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:14.989
Yeah, once.

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.275
That was a long time ago now.

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:19.833
Do you miss her?

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:21.359
Well, of course, I do.

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:26.075
She was...
She was my best friend.

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:28.196
Who's your best
friend now then?

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:31.312
Well, you are, of course.
Come here.

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.158
Why, who's yours?

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:37.709
I think it's probably Mum.

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:42.669
Yeah.

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:46.717
I'm not so terrible though, am I?

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.677
I'm not answering that.

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:54.997
You know what you are.

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.000
It's just round the corner.
This way.

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:26.229
Oh, Dexter!

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.117
Damn it, they're early.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.548
You're early.

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:33.915
We thought we'd surprise you.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.672
Clearly, we have.

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.189
Mum, Dad, this is Emma Morley.
Morley.

01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:41.599
Hello.
Pleased to meet you.

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.796
Emma, you'll join us
for tea, yes?

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:47.077
No, no, thanks.
I should leave you to it.

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.674
Are you going to go?
Yeah. Well,

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:52.314
pleasure to meet you and...

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:54.789
Well, have a nice life.

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:56.029
Okay.

01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.913
I'm sorry. Did we
just interrupt something?

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.874
No, no.
Emma's just a good friend.

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.638
Weren't you
wearing this yesterday?

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.679
The rascal.

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.032
Emma! Em!

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.873
Em, wait! Wait, wait.

01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:28.517
Look, I need your phone number.

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:31.910
My number?
Right. Of course.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.513
Look, I'm so sorry
about all of that.

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:37.229
I wasn't expecting them until after we...
Well, you know.

01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:39.714
Right.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:41.874
This is me in Edinburgh.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.274
Right.

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:45.992
My parents' number

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:49.276
and their address just in case.

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.634
Right.

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.117
Oh. Dad's got
a fax machine at work.

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:55.873
Just the phone number's fine.

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.188
Thank you.

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:29.389
Look, I've got to go.

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:30.549
I know.

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.759
But we will see
each other again.

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.439
I know we will.

01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:40.234
Goodbye, Dex.

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.879
Goodbye.

01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:44.388
Goodbye.
