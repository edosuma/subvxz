00:18.858 --> 00:19.941
In 1184 BC.

00:23.660 --> 00:25.577
This is the Bronze Age.

00:28.676 --> 00:29.926
The Bronze Age.

00:34.815 --> 00:38.232
Let's not forget the destruction of Troy.

00:40.266 --> 00:41.099
Agamemnon.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.126
Agamemnon.

00:46.798 --> 00:49.048
Achilles and his Myrmidons.

00:50.726 --> 00:51.559
Helen.

00:53.152 --> 00:53.985
Menelaus.

00:56.269 --> 00:57.102
Odysseus.

00:58.869 --> 01:00.868
Odysseus, come on.

01:04.075 --> 01:04.908
Ajax.

01:07.091 --> 01:09.872
Diomedes.

01:09.874 --> 01:10.707
Patroclus.

01:12.975 --> 01:15.063
Yeah, if Patroclus didn't die, of course

01:15.065 --> 01:16.813
Achilles's probably not.

01:16.815 --> 01:18.198
He feeling the same way.

01:19.315 --> 01:24.315
The Myrmidons, they're
behind Achilles 100%.

01:35.274 --> 01:36.607
Tartarus sounds.

01:37.769 --> 01:39.102
It's closer now.

01:40.275 --> 01:42.192
Hear the children play.

02:20.645 --> 02:21.645
Patroclus.

02:27.516 --> 02:28.349
Patroclus.

02:38.172 --> 02:40.273
Your name is Achilles.

02:40.275 --> 02:42.608
You, here, what did you die?

02:44.266 --> 02:46.099
Are you first in this?

02:49.675 --> 02:50.508
Funny guy.

02:52.236 --> 02:54.319
Have the gods fooled you?

02:56.553 --> 02:57.553
They did me.

03:00.205 --> 03:02.538
We might have gotten asleep.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.597
- Now I have.
- Father!

03:11.600 --> 03:13.353
Anchises!

03:21.099 --> 03:21.932
Anchises!

03:32.198 --> 03:33.031
Father!

03:52.230 --> 03:53.063
Anchises!

03:57.451 --> 04:00.118
Now I have the head of a fool.

04:03.259 --> 04:05.009
Are you ready to die?

04:09.618 --> 04:11.618
Mister demigod is wrong.

04:13.068 --> 04:14.485
You will die now.

04:15.882 --> 04:18.781
And I won't need you to speak.

04:19.959 --> 04:24.793
Aeneas you better believe I
will kill you where you stand.

04:32.868 --> 04:37.118
You have reached Troy, or
have you become its tomb?

04:39.994 --> 04:40.911
Anchises!

04:41.838 --> 04:43.755
Dispirit, you are it.

04:46.479 --> 04:47.896
You are the last.

04:49.603 --> 04:51.261
That's what I hear.

04:51.263 --> 04:53.013
Anchises, Anchises!

04:53.948 --> 04:54.781
- Ah.
- Why?

04:56.775 --> 04:58.442
Why why why, Aeneas?

05:01.366 --> 05:04.116
Did you introduce Helen to Paris?

05:07.783 --> 05:09.450
Everybody knew that.

05:10.636 --> 05:13.209
Know that you did that, Aeneus.

05:13.211 --> 05:17.616
You shouldn't have
introduced Helen to Paris.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.201
Look what happened.

05:20.097 --> 05:23.930
You lose the Trojan War,
Aeneas's fault, yeah?

05:32.095 --> 05:33.068
Stay right there.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.461
He looks like a bum.

05:43.332 --> 05:46.243
You can have me, I'm
gonna walk all the way

05:46.245 --> 05:48.403
to where you can see me.

05:48.405 --> 05:51.712
You have to respect your father.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.957
But Aeneas, you didn't.

05:58.344 --> 06:03.344
If the gods put you ,
the gods put you.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.966
You might die tonight.

06:09.805 --> 06:11.305
You little prince.

06:15.068 --> 06:15.901
Dead.

06:22.317 --> 06:25.734
Aeneas I have something else to tell you.

06:30.927 --> 06:33.844
You make a city out of dead people.

06:39.722 --> 06:40.555
What?

06:43.703 --> 06:44.536
Troy.

06:46.905 --> 06:48.072
And all of us.

06:51.026 --> 06:51.857
The Trojan War.

06:51.859 --> 06:52.776
And thus.

06:55.395 --> 06:58.698
Mighty Achilles is dead.

06:59.945 --> 07:02.278
Hector is dead.

07:03.765 --> 07:07.305
Prince Paris and Helen
of Troy have disappeared.

07:08.825 --> 07:13.548
Now a prince, a Trojan prince.

07:15.325 --> 07:20.325
Much more of a Dardanian, has
visited the mural of Achilles.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.292
Chosen by the gods he was and nude.

07:29.555 --> 07:33.908
To find a new home, that
will be his destiny.

07:36.461 --> 07:38.313
So listen to the gods.

07:38.315 --> 07:41.203
He must obey the gods.

07:41.205 --> 07:42.488
To become king.

07:45.005 --> 07:47.928
For Achilles is dead.

07:49.872 --> 07:51.658
But let's talk about the future.

07:53.426 --> 07:54.259
Rome.

07:55.655 --> 07:59.518
The mightiest empire to hit planet earth.

08:01.445 --> 08:04.188
Cross the seas like no one has ever seen.

08:05.092 --> 08:05.925
Troy!

08:16.772 --> 08:19.439
This is your destiny, correct?

08:21.679 --> 08:23.075
It's true.

08:25.143 --> 08:27.560
I almost gave you the speech.

08:29.811 --> 08:30.728
Forgive me.

08:34.015 --> 08:36.347
If it leaks or growing warm,

08:37.404 --> 08:39.654
it means we're not staying.

08:41.586 --> 08:45.836
And anyone who silence me
will learn that even now.

08:52.003 --> 08:54.420
But now my destiny is to die.

09:01.510 --> 09:03.427
Aeneas, get outta here.

09:09.327 --> 09:10.910
Get outta here now.

09:13.533 --> 09:16.616
And you tell Hector you will be there

09:21.454 --> 09:23.037
when the sun rises.

09:45.508 --> 09:47.008
This is sinking.

10:00.432 --> 10:01.432
Off we go.

10:21.502 --> 10:22.335
Welcome.

10:24.381 --> 10:25.548
Too Tartarus.

10:26.619 --> 10:27.952
Tartarus Aeneas.

10:29.970 --> 10:30.803
Welcome.

10:33.563 --> 10:35.646
Have you seen more death?

10:36.942 --> 10:40.942
All the people who do bad
in the world will die.

10:42.258 --> 10:43.248
Look at them.

10:44.315 --> 10:47.818
Slaves to the higher power.

10:49.125 --> 10:52.678
God, there's many gods, Aeneas.

10:53.555 --> 10:55.998
So Tartarus is not where you belong.

10:58.185 --> 11:02.052
Follow her who will lead you to the river.

11:04.614 --> 11:06.281
Elysium is that way.

11:11.105 --> 11:14.522
Aeneas I didn't know your skin had color.

11:16.025 --> 11:20.692
I heard myth of you
being dark or darker than

11:22.385 --> 11:27.385
most men, I guess the Dardanians
are who they say they are.

11:30.505 --> 11:33.565
The Egyptians talk of you being the God

11:34.852 --> 11:39.673
like of Alexander the
Great and even he thought

11:39.675 --> 11:41.589
- to be a god.
- Troy!

11:41.591 --> 11:43.185
So enough.

11:43.187 --> 11:45.054
- So what makes you...
- We're full.

11:45.056 --> 11:50.056
Smart enough to come across
in the dungeon of hell?

11:54.035 --> 11:55.315
- Hmm.
- Pass through.

11:56.805 --> 11:57.853
Who knows why.

11:57.855 --> 11:59.400
You hear Charon?

11:59.402 --> 12:01.253
Charon is speaking now.

12:01.255 --> 12:02.763
Fall away.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.443
Sing in wondering.

12:04.445 --> 12:09.445
How you could pass the
river but not be dead.

12:10.189 --> 12:12.798
Is it the golden bull?

12:12.800 --> 12:13.717
I think so!

12:15.746 --> 12:18.363
Leave, Aeneas, at once.

12:18.365 --> 12:21.708
For time is very important.

12:23.225 --> 12:25.582
I'm sure you know of that.

12:25.584 --> 12:28.268
Zeus is watching, Aeneas.

12:31.505 --> 12:32.508
Zeus is watching.

12:34.255 --> 12:36.738
Zeus is watching.

12:55.495 --> 12:56.328
Burn, now!

12:59.375 --> 13:02.142
My last words will be now.

13:08.400 --> 13:13.400
Burn.

13:15.405 --> 13:18.038
There is nothing more to say now.

13:19.796 --> 13:20.963
For I am here.

13:37.778 --> 13:40.818
Father, I will make you proud!

13:43.695 --> 13:47.448
Your son will discover Rome.

13:58.182 --> 13:59.988
But at what price?

14:01.685 --> 14:06.492
For Father has shown me
that Romulus and Remus,

14:09.095 --> 14:10.288
one must die.

14:12.355 --> 14:14.842
So still blood must be shed.

14:35.568 --> 14:39.581
He tips it!

14:39.583 --> 14:42.836
What do they say?

14:42.838 --> 14:44.421
The Egyptians, huh?

14:45.275 --> 14:49.722
I hear they say they have not seen

14:50.677 --> 14:52.844
since Alexander the Great.

14:55.933 --> 14:59.766
And even he offended a
god and was not enough.

15:03.959 --> 15:04.792
Even he.

15:06.905 --> 15:10.078
So why should I stand here tonight

15:12.774 --> 15:14.024
in celebration?

15:19.147 --> 15:21.230
This isn't a celebration.

15:24.351 --> 15:25.768
This will be war.

15:52.828 --> 15:55.078
A war they will not forget.

16:11.980 --> 16:16.980
Hector, I will remember you.

16:23.685 --> 16:28.685
Your body dragged away
by Achilles's chariot

16:29.562 --> 16:32.378
and they expect me to not forget.

16:34.157 --> 16:36.198
I will not forget.

16:49.896 --> 16:51.896
It seems I am done here.

16:53.985 --> 16:54.998
I have done.

16:57.345 --> 16:58.178
Spoke.

17:03.135 --> 17:04.598
Or should I say speak?

17:13.224 --> 17:15.978
Can you hear Poseidon now?

17:44.325 --> 17:46.338
By morning I will be gone.

17:48.185 --> 17:53.185
A new home, that is where I am headed.

17:57.545 --> 18:01.208
No need for any celebrations tonight.

18:04.590 --> 18:05.423
It's only me.

19:21.949 --> 19:22.782
Achilles!

19:35.947 --> 19:36.780
Achilles!

19:50.162 --> 19:55.162
Troy is no more.

20:01.551 --> 20:03.884
The Greeks have sacked Troy.

20:16.680 --> 20:17.930
Hector is dead.

20:30.116 --> 20:33.616
Even Thor's hammer couldn't help Achilles.

20:42.619 --> 20:43.452
Father!

20:53.172 --> 20:54.505
Troy is no more.

21:17.262 --> 21:19.512
The gods have sent me here.

21:34.963 --> 21:36.130
Zeus, hear me!

21:43.630 --> 21:44.547
The Greeks.

21:52.839 --> 21:54.506
The Greeks will pay.

21:57.687 --> 21:59.354
The Greeks will pay.

22:13.875 --> 22:14.708
Achilles!

22:17.512 --> 22:19.179
I will remember you!

22:22.785 --> 22:24.058
You fought well.

22:30.615 --> 22:32.408
You knew your destiny.

22:41.614 --> 22:42.447
Father!

22:43.845 --> 22:48.845
Is this place called Rome, truly,

22:49.960 --> 22:52.793
when I am supposed to discover it?

23:12.088 --> 23:12.921
I hear you!

23:28.618 --> 23:29.951
Troy is no more!

23:41.921 --> 23:43.254
Troy is no more!

23:48.405 --> 23:50.858
I will find us a new home!

23:54.915 --> 23:56.438
I see you are listening.

23:59.625 --> 24:04.625
I will find us a new home
for truth, honor, destiny.

24:11.115 --> 24:11.948
Zeus, hear me!

24:15.795 --> 24:18.138
Nothing will stop me now.

24:20.950 --> 24:22.033
Hear me, god!

24:39.775 --> 24:40.658
My mother!

24:47.165 --> 24:49.975
Little do you know this
is her day as well.

25:53.779 --> 25:55.612
I've been resurrected!

25:58.315 --> 25:59.148
Tartarus!

26:03.239 --> 26:04.572
Now that's hale.

26:10.888 --> 26:11.878
I am here!

26:13.515 --> 26:15.492
Gods, do you hear me now?

26:25.659 --> 26:29.409
Will this be the river
where Rome will begin?

26:40.345 --> 26:45.345
Is it true that Rome will fall,
stretched across the lands?

26:49.535 --> 26:54.535
Is it true Augustus
will lead after Caesar?

27:02.665 --> 27:05.692
Menelaus was a fool to talk to so adroit.

27:10.255 --> 27:14.558
Even though the Greeks
have won, they will fall.

27:17.585 --> 27:18.958
They will fall again.

27:20.655 --> 27:21.488
Like Troy.

27:36.746 --> 27:40.413
For it wasn't Prince
Paris who shot Achilles

27:41.585 --> 27:42.435
through his heel.

27:44.275 --> 27:45.188
It was me!

27:49.594 --> 27:53.261
I gave that faith to
Paris because it was me

27:56.525 --> 27:58.878
who introduced him to Helen.

28:01.871 --> 28:03.915
Are the gods displeased?

28:08.387 --> 28:11.598
Tell me now for I am here.

28:21.765 --> 28:22.598
Tell me now.

28:40.445 --> 28:41.508
Let the fires burn.

28:46.625 --> 28:49.662
The fallen soldiers of Troy and Greece.

28:55.370 --> 28:57.120
All of this for love.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.058
I will build us a new home.

32:46.425 --> 32:51.425
Father tell me is war what they want?

32:53.345 --> 32:56.148
Is war the only way?

32:59.805 --> 33:01.438
We must have peace!

33:13.685 --> 33:17.408
If it's a war they want,
a war they will get!

33:24.957 --> 33:29.957
If it's war they want, war they will get!

33:46.879 --> 33:51.708
My father, Anchises has
already told me my future.

33:53.645 --> 33:54.918
I already know.

33:56.265 --> 33:57.418
This is no surprise.

33:59.875 --> 34:04.875
The gods have led me here
past the shore of Carthage.

34:06.399 --> 34:07.232
Past!

34:10.339 --> 34:11.589
My father died.

34:14.308 --> 34:18.155
Little did I know, Dido as well.

34:23.284 --> 34:28.284
Even Mercury came to tell me
that my destiny was elsewhere.

35:13.075 --> 35:18.075
Our name will last for thousands of years.

35:23.947 --> 35:26.280
They will remember Achilles!

35:28.263 --> 35:30.430
They will remember Hector!

35:48.019 --> 35:51.266
Achilles and his partner dance.

35:51.268 --> 35:52.101
Ha!

35:53.947 --> 35:55.841
He wouldn't have fought

35:55.843 --> 35:59.176
if it wasn't for the death of Patroclus.

36:05.887 --> 36:07.970
I have the sword of Troy.

36:15.421 --> 36:18.254
So on this very night hear me now.

36:22.521 --> 36:24.688
I will fulfill my destiny.

36:26.138 --> 36:28.388
Nothing will stop that now.

36:48.661 --> 36:49.494
Ha!

36:55.306 --> 36:57.056
This must be a dream.

37:04.984 --> 37:08.234
The world will remember the Trojan War.

37:15.202 --> 37:19.119
And I will continue the
destiny of all Trojans.

37:31.235 --> 37:33.748
I can hear them in Sparta now.

37:35.085 --> 37:37.585
Laughing that Troy has fallen.

37:42.858 --> 37:47.389
Peace was supposed to be
between Troy and Sparta.

38:32.081 --> 38:33.599
Zeus is watching.

38:35.036 --> 38:36.453
Zeus is watching.

38:37.549 --> 38:38.382
Turnus.

38:40.056 --> 38:41.473
Turnus calm down.

38:43.402 --> 38:48.402
Aeneas is come from a far
journey, from far away.

38:50.475 --> 38:52.452
He must have something to say.

38:54.692 --> 38:56.058
Aeneas, come forth.

38:57.715 --> 39:00.463
We have heard of your arrival

39:00.465 --> 39:04.661
for we already know the
death of Dido has lead you

39:04.663 --> 39:05.996
out of Carthage.

39:07.062 --> 39:08.645
Hmm, must be those.

39:09.564 --> 39:14.314
Must be that clothing that
you have, the purple and gold.

39:15.595 --> 39:16.762
Hmm, Carthage.

39:18.883 --> 39:23.421
But I heard you were wearing
a Greece cape out of Troy,

39:23.423 --> 39:24.340
is it true?

39:26.349 --> 39:28.099
Tell me is that true?

39:29.858 --> 39:32.715
Then why should you be king?

39:32.717 --> 39:36.041
Tell me Aeneas, why
you should become king.

39:36.043 --> 39:38.043
Turnus, shut your mouth.

39:39.200 --> 39:41.950
You, even though you stop at war?

39:46.158 --> 39:46.991
Aeneas.

39:48.609 --> 39:52.968
King, can you do what the
gods say that you will do?

39:52.970 --> 39:55.470
Lord no for I's a spiritual.

39:56.642 --> 40:00.998
Oh yeah, spiritual advisor.

40:02.195 --> 40:05.628
Spiritual advisor, trust me.

40:07.235 --> 40:08.813
Hmm.

40:08.815 --> 40:10.943
We know you here, Aeneas.

40:10.945 --> 40:12.013
I am king here.

40:12.015 --> 40:14.638
You say you want this land that you claim.

40:18.845 --> 40:19.678
Take it.

44:27.165 --> 44:29.495
The Trojan War is over.

44:32.026 --> 44:34.359
The mighty Achilles is dead.

44:36.345 --> 44:38.638
Hector is dead.

44:40.165 --> 44:43.725
Prince Paris and Helen
of Troy have disappeared.

44:45.732 --> 44:50.732
And a prince, a Trojan prince,
much more of a Dardanian,

44:56.765 --> 44:58.858
has visited the mural of Achilles.

45:01.835 --> 45:03.585
Chosen by the gods he was not,

45:05.525 --> 45:10.018
to fight war, that will be his destiny.

45:12.668 --> 45:17.112
To listen to the gods he must
obey the gods to become king.

45:21.613 --> 45:24.275
For Achilles is dead.

45:26.625 --> 45:28.038
Let's talk about the future.

45:29.927 --> 45:30.760
Of Rome.

45:32.105 --> 45:35.878
The mightiest empire to hit planet Earth.

45:37.805 --> 45:41.203
Cross the seas like no one has ever seen.

45:41.205 --> 45:42.038
Troy!

45:42.975 --> 45:44.428
In 1184 BC.

45:48.175 --> 45:49.998
This is the Bronze Age.

45:52.935 --> 45:54.818
The Bronze Age.

45:59.375 --> 46:01.998
Let's not forget the destruction of Troy.

46:07.875 --> 46:11.220
Let's not forget the
destruction of the Trojans.

46:16.845 --> 46:17.678
Agamemnon.

46:20.057 --> 46:20.890
Agamemnon.

46:23.578 --> 46:25.828
Achilles and his Myrmidons.

46:27.428 --> 46:28.261
Helen.

46:29.718 --> 46:30.551
Menelaus.

46:32.694 --> 46:33.527
Odysseus.

46:36.930 --> 46:38.430
Odysseus, come on.

46:41.035 --> 46:41.868
Ajax.

46:48.810 --> 46:49.643
Diomedes.

46:51.315 --> 46:52.148
Patroclus.

46:54.643 --> 46:57.165
Man if Patroclus didn't die first Achilles

46:57.167 --> 47:00.250
wouldn't have been there in a frenzy.

47:03.182 --> 47:04.265
Why Achilles?

47:05.511 --> 47:06.511
Heaven sent.

47:08.497 --> 47:11.347
For all we knew Patroclus was
killed by Achilles's honor.

47:12.205 --> 47:15.242
How do you think Aeneas got the sword?

47:26.365 --> 47:27.815
Let's talk about the Trojans.

47:30.745 --> 47:31.578
Priya.

47:34.605 --> 47:35.438
Hecuba.

47:37.065 --> 47:38.523
Hecuba.

47:38.525 --> 47:39.358
Hector.

47:41.019 --> 47:41.852
Paris.

47:44.439 --> 47:46.118
Who knows where Paris went.

47:52.310 --> 47:53.143
Aphrodite?

47:54.961 --> 47:56.211
Apollo, Apollo.

47:57.881 --> 47:58.798
Ares, Ares.

47:59.932 --> 48:01.689
Artemis, Artemis.

48:06.870 --> 48:08.937
The ancestors of the Romans.

48:10.224 --> 48:12.931
The ancestors of the Romans.

48:12.933 --> 48:14.183
Same as Aeneas.

48:16.531 --> 48:20.412
Same, I suspect, as me.

48:20.414 --> 48:22.081
His name was Aeneas.

48:24.283 --> 48:26.533
He is the founding of Rome.

48:30.050 --> 48:32.756
The first six we won against.

48:32.758 --> 48:35.341
The second six will be destiny.

48:37.313 --> 48:38.980
Still haven't heard.
