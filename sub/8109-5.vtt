I had some
dental work done

24:56.996 --> 24:58.236
in the Philippines
when l was a kid.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.697
Adjoining metal fillings
could corrode and
pick up AM radio signals.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.328
Open your mouth.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.453
Your fillings
don't touch.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.877
So there's no reason for me
to be hearing things?

25:10.968 --> 25:13.004
I can only tell you that
you're hearing sounds
as you should.

25:13.095 --> 25:14.505
If you're also
hearing sounds
that you shouldn't,

25:14.596 --> 25:15.756
that would be
a psychosis.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.965
You'd have to talk to
someone who does brain.
I only do ears.

25:27.943 --> 25:32.858
Bravo.
It's amazing how you did
120 hours in one day.

25:33.657 --> 25:37.241
I wasn't on
my best behavior,
I admit. Allow me.

25:38.996 --> 25:41.612
From now on,
I'm gonna supervise your
practicum requirements.

25:41.707 --> 25:42.822
That won't be necessary.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.907
You want to annoy
another doctor first?
Eventually...

25:45.002 --> 25:48.790
It's not necessary
because I'm not ready
to be a doctor again.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.085

There was nothing
wrong with it.

So aside from
him being an idiot,
what else did we learn?

27:20.389 --> 27:23.256
The pain is real.
It's coming
from somewhere.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.851
What about bone cancer?

27:24.935 --> 27:27.142
You can't connect
bone cancer
to the heart.

this can wait

27:29.148 --> 27:31.810
Actually, he told Cuddy
he's not ready to work.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.891
He quit?
Apparently.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.602
It's a power play.
He'll be back tomorrow.

27:36.697 --> 27:39.484
Bone cancer could trigger
a paraneoplastic syndrome,

27:39.575 --> 27:40.564
which shuts down
the heart.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.116
Primary bone cancer
isn't hereditary.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.192
Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.

27:44.288 --> 27:45.653
lt's hereditary
and it increases

27:45.747 --> 27:48.614
a person's risk of
having bone cancer.

27:50.627 --> 27:51.912
You have another theory?

27:52.004 --> 27:54.461
My theory is
it's not bone cancer.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.127
Gamma survey would
locate the tumors.

that I hear whispering

Today, I am.

31:34.309 --> 31:37.392

have a problem,

or you were
jerking me around,

38:20.757 --> 38:22.213
What about us?

38:23.218 --> 38:25.459
We're good.
Just like this.

38:25.553 --> 38:26.884
You press my buttons,
| press yours.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.962
By”buﬂonsﬂ
you mean...

38:35.021 --> 38:36.136
Huh.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.236
You do make me
feel funny.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.034
You're not gonna die.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.619
l've accepted it.
It's okay.

38:59.254 --> 39:01.791
In addition to
high arches

39:01.881 --> 39:04.372
and some crystal bowl
in the shape of a tuna,

39:04.467 --> 39:08.085
you also inherited
a self-destruct button.

39:09.639 --> 39:11.129
Forms in the brain stem.

39:11.224 --> 39:13.465
Technically,
it's an aneurysm,
presses on nerves

39:13.560 --> 39:16.552
that control everything
from tooth pain
to heart rate.

39:16.646 --> 39:18.477
As you get older,
it gets bigger,

39:18.565 --> 39:23.150
until finally the button,
which I'll call
"intracranial berry aneurysm,"

39:23.236 --> 39:26.694
because I had a friend in
high school with that name,
stops the signal

39:26.781 --> 39:29.568
from your brain to
your heart and bam!

39:30.618 --> 39:32.825
How do I know you're
not still lying to me?

39:32.912 --> 39:34.573
Saying l'm healthy
just to make me
feel better?

39:34.664 --> 39:36.700
It does sound
that way, doesn't it?

39:36.791 --> 39:38.747
But this time,
no sugar pills.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.200
I'm going to cut
into your brain

39:40.295 --> 39:41.910
to make you think
that I'm fixing it.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.496
And if our fake tests
confirm it,

39:44.591 --> 39:46.377
I'm going to be cutting
into your son's brain, too.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.958
Because I'm just
that committed.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.169
Michael is going to
be okay?

39:52.265 --> 39:54.506
Unless he walks out of here
and gets run over by a bus,

39:54.601 --> 39:57.889
in which case,
lwill reconsider
your fate argument.

39:59.272 --> 40:03.515
You wanna give him a call?
Visiting hours don't
apply to my patients.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.396
Yeah. In a bit.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.613
Yeah, that's what I thought.

40:11.868 --> 40:14.860
The "saving the kid
from pain" stuff was crap.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.865
You just don't want
anything in your life
that won't let you do

40:16.956 --> 40:18.071
whatever the hell
you want to do

40:18.166 --> 40:20.157
whenever the hell
you want to do it.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.539
You've had it easy.
Sorry to screw you up.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.433
Mom.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.369
Maybe when
we get out of here...

41:06.214 --> 41:08.375
What kind of movies
you like?

41:16.557 --> 41:22.393
He's been missing
for eight hours.
Robert Chase. C-H-A-S...

41:22.730 --> 41:23.936
Hey!

41:26.234 --> 41:28.771
Never mind.
He just walked in. Sorry.

41:28.861 --> 41:29.850
You could've called me.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.194
| forgot.
To call me?

41:32.281 --> 41:34.988
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Where were you?

41:35.076 --> 41:36.407
You're drunk.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.654
All right, I...

41:39.372 --> 41:41.784
I needed to get wasted.
I did.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.206
And now I'm better.

41:44.961 --> 41:46.417
What aren't
you telling me?

41:46.504 --> 41:47.744
Nothing.

41:56.806 --> 41:58.922
(VOICE WHISPERING)

42:00.309 --> 42:01.765
(WHISPERING STOPS)

42:33.217 --> 42:34.627
Hi, Dad.

42:39.932 --> 42:41.388
I think I've been

42:42.935 --> 42:45.472
focusing on
the wrong thing.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.147
There were
some good times.

42:54.655 --> 42:57.442
Wilson, this is stupid!

43:00.244 --> 43:01.654
You see?

43:02.497 --> 43:04.738
He really is
getting better.
