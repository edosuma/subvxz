She is remarkable.

43:42.354 --> 43:45.188
I've never seen anyone
so gifted with magic.

43:45.190 --> 43:48.057
Arcadia, she is
naturally gifted.

43:49.327 --> 43:51.728
Beyond that, we had a
great teacher in Kae.

43:56.301 --> 43:58.034
And what of you?

43:58.036 --> 43:59.902
For all your talk
of studying together

43:59.904 --> 44:02.005
I've not seen you
cast a single spell.

44:03.074 --> 44:05.208
Is there something
you're not telling me?

44:07.746 --> 44:08.878
It is my own fault.

44:11.282 --> 44:13.016
I was overconfident
with my abilities

44:13.018 --> 44:15.918
and threw caution to the wind.

44:16.888 --> 44:17.888
Rahim.

44:18.823 --> 44:19.823
What happened?

44:33.171 --> 44:35.071
This is the mark of arrogance.

44:36.775 --> 44:38.741
I chased after spells
that even masters

44:38.743 --> 44:39.809
use with precaution.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.712
I'm lucky to be alive.

44:43.348 --> 44:45.214
How long will it take to heal?

44:46.217 --> 44:48.818
This is as healed
as I will ever see it.

44:48.820 --> 44:49.886
Well let me cast holy water.

44:49.888 --> 44:51.187
It will do nothing.

44:54.092 --> 44:55.391
The part of me
that once communed

44:55.393 --> 44:57.226
with nature itself is lost.

44:59.831 --> 45:02.331
I must bear this as a
reminder of caution to others.

45:04.169 --> 45:06.002
When this is all over,

45:06.004 --> 45:07.370
I will find a way to help you.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.206
There are many
things in this world

45:10.208 --> 45:12.275
which we do not yet understand.

45:12.277 --> 45:14.911
And there may yet be
something that can aid you.

45:17.282 --> 45:18.347
Thank you, friend.

45:19.150 --> 45:20.783
I do not doubt your word.

45:23.154 --> 45:24.220
Does Arcadia know?

45:29.961 --> 45:32.161
She was one of the
first to try and help.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.934
But don't worry about me,
I don't need protection.

45:37.936 --> 45:40.403
I don't want you
worsening your condition.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.772
I will not let this
stop me from living.

45:44.109 --> 45:46.042
I want to live a full life

45:47.512 --> 45:49.345
with those who see
me for what I am

45:51.015 --> 45:53.216

mistakes I've made.

Are you well, commander?

48:19.030 --> 48:20.963
We're nearing the
Wastelands, Lieutenant.

48:23.635 --> 48:25.301
Yes sir.

48:25.303 --> 48:27.536
This is an alternate route
that affords us speed.

48:30.408 --> 48:32.441
The King has ordered us to
stay out of the Wastelands

48:32.443 --> 48:35.511
unless we provoke
the fallen to attack.

48:35.513 --> 48:37.446
They have already
begun the attack.

48:38.583 --> 48:41.350
Bevervick is a warning
of what is to come.

48:41.352 --> 48:44.086
We all swore an oath
to the crown, Lieutenant.

48:45.490 --> 48:47.523
Here do I give my
life to the crown

48:47.525 --> 48:50.393
and all she protects.

48:50.395 --> 48:52.528
The lands of the
crown, its citizens,

48:52.530 --> 48:55.932
the Royal Protector,
yet I hear no mention

48:55.934 --> 48:57.133
of the King himself.

48:58.536 --> 49:00.269
Are you being
flippant, Lieutenant?

49:00.271 --> 49:03.706
I am merely concerned for
the well-being of the crown.

49:03.708 --> 49:05.241
I will not foolishly
risk the lives

49:05.243 --> 49:07.343
of my brothers in arms.

49:10.481 --> 49:12.348
Sir, what are you
keeping from me?

49:23.461 --> 49:25.628
It's not the first time
I entered the Wastelands

49:25.630 --> 49:29.732
nor the first time I risked
violating the Royal Charter.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.406
During our last campaign,

49:37.408 --> 49:40.109
countless of our own were
captured by the fallen.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.513
This was before we knew
anything about our enemy.

49:44.515 --> 49:46.582
They were but another
foreign tribe.

49:48.987 --> 49:50.653
I was to take a company
of soldiers in an attempt

49:50.655 --> 49:52.521
to rescue them.

49:52.523 --> 49:54.457
Simply sneak in and save them.

49:58.763 --> 50:00.429
I was ordered to stand down.

50:07.638 --> 50:09.438
I could not leave
our people to die

50:09.440 --> 50:10.740
a cruel death at a foreign land

50:10.742 --> 50:13.275
so when my company
arrived, we attacked.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.351
That was when we
learned the fallen

50:22.353 --> 50:24.053
are not born but returned.

50:28.493 --> 50:31.494
Men and women, tortured
until they're nothing

50:31.496 --> 50:34.463
but husks of their
former selves.

50:41.039 --> 50:44.807
Our assailants,
once our friends.

50:46.444 --> 50:48.210
I would look into
his eyes and I,

50:50.548 --> 50:52.214
I see him as he once was.

50:57.221 --> 50:58.788
I could still hear his voice

50:58.789 --> 51:00.549
which once resonated
with laughter and truth.

51:04.195 --> 51:07.263
They all echoed with
death and despair.

51:11.602 --> 51:13.302
None of my soldiers
was prepared.

51:15.573 --> 51:16.573
I...

51:19.477 --> 51:20.643
I was not prepared.

51:29.454 --> 51:32.388
We now know the enemy we face.

51:32.390 --> 51:34.557
You are not leading
these soldiers astray.

51:35.593 --> 51:38.127
We know what we face,
we stay our path.

51:40.465 --> 51:41.797
If this route leads
us into the Wastelands,

51:41.799 --> 51:43.632
the fallen are sure
to take notice.

51:45.236 --> 51:49.105
Should we survive, the
King will be displeased.

51:50.575 --> 51:52.575
Every officer here
will be in shackles.

51:53.744 --> 51:56.412
These soldiers are noble
in their conduct and calling.

lying in the field.

She torments because
I failed her.

Forgive yourself.

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:21.009
I do not need
your pity, Arcadia.

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:24.513
Forgive me.

01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:31.219

bothers you so I will leave.

01:06:31.221 --> 01:06:32.587
It was my fault she is dead.

Her death is on my hands.

since I laid her to rest.

01:07:06.323 --> 01:07:08.490
And in my anger I
left her in the night.

recovered her body

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:19.100

into a single creation.

This is but the first of many.

We will use it to
storm the next town.

01:08:10.654 --> 01:08:12.520
I will study its effectiveness

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:16.858
and make it more stronger
with every forging.

We should be turning
villages into our servants,

into weapons of war.

What use is an army if we
have no empire to rule?

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:31.606
I will not bet our
victory on chance.

There will be many
left to fill our ranks.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.447

take us to the gates

memory grows cloudy.

What was it that called
you to join the church?

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.327

Hmm, you could have
served your country

01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:33.635
and stayed in your homeland
as one of its guards.

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.703
My homeland is an island.

01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:38.173
The sea itself is our protector.

01:09:38.175 --> 01:09:40.742
The Blackguard have never
set foot on our shores

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:43.243
but I couldn't stay safe
while others were attacked.

01:09:43.246 --> 01:09:44.645
You do not fear them.

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:46.514
I'm concerned for the
death and destruction

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:47.582
they will bring.

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:48.750
It cannot be allowed.

01:09:49.853 --> 01:09:50.853
Hmm.

face in the days ahead

foe have become.

I pray our forces are true.

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:25.653
If the tide turns and
our strength fails us,

01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:29.591
the King must be warned
of the growing threat.

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:30.992

your side in battle

01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:32.961

01:10:32.963 --> 01:10:34.462

01:10:39.603 --> 01:10:42.737
Lior, I've lost too many
friends over the years.

01:10:44.274 --> 01:10:45.773
You have many
years ahead of you.

01:10:46.643 --> 01:10:48.009
If I am to die in that field,

01:10:48.011 --> 01:10:49.011
it'll be as it must.

Your greatest deeds
may yet lie ahead.

You are most kind, sir.

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:00.756
Come.

01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:27.548
Give it time, Denzikel.

Though your healing
may come slowly,

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:34.355
even with great sadness,
there's something to learn.

01:11:35.759 --> 01:11:38.993
Your friends will be glad
to know that you survived.

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:46.000
I cannot change my
fate, nor would I.

01:11:48.505 --> 01:11:50.405
You are quick to say so.

01:11:50.407 --> 01:11:53.041
I miss my friends dearly.

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:57.745
But to want the power to
change my fate is unthinkable.

01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:04.986
Though it is natural to
wish to see those we have lost

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:07.755
but our natural emotion
should not cause us guilt.

01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:16.731
I fear deep sadness
that spoils into anger

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:18.399

desiring power

might one day be tempted

makes me doubt my strength.

You Denzikel, are
a servant of good.

your desire to do
